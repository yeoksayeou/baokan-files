Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "The successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution are grown in the midst of the masses and tempered in the great wind and storm of the revolution." We must take class struggle as our main course and grow and temper ourselves along the path indicated by Chairman Mao.

However, the Chinese Khrushchev openly advocates: "The work of national construction is the central task of our Party throughout the country. We should shift the Party's and the League's central work to national construction. There will be no more major campaigns in the future; we should concentrate our efforts on economic construction." He also blathers on about how "the Young Communist League is an organization for study," and that the task of the youth is to "study culture and technology." Another top capitalist-roader within the Party also puts forward "labor, study, unity" as the "policy for a certain period of the League." They never mention class struggle, attempting to lead the youth astray onto the revisionist path.

A handful of capitalist-roaders within our school also follow the tune of the Chinese Khrushchev, shouting slogans like "the school is a place for imparting knowledge" and "mastering one's specialty is the political task of the students." They propose:

"The ideological work of the League must be based on teaching." Under this guidance, the League organization in our school does not lead comrades to study Chairman Mao's works, does not engage in class struggle, and does not lead the youth in ideological revolution. Some League branches, on League Day, organize members to seek advice from bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities" on "scholarly methods." Some League branches organize discussions on the theme of "how to give a good lecture." Some classes, during League organizational life activities, take "planting great aspirations, establishing great ambitions, and scaling the peak of the educational cause" as the theme, guiding everyone to talk about bourgeois individual "ideals" and "aspirations." What is even more serious is that the League organization once held "friendship dance parties" and "fashion shows," using the bourgeois "fragrance" and stench to corrupt the youth. If things go on like this, will the revolutionary and militant Communist Youth League not become a revisionist "professional League" and "lifestyle League"?

Participating in the socialist education movement in cities and countryside is a great opportunity for youth students to undergo tempering through class struggle. However, a handful of capitalist-roaders within our school's Party strongly obstruct this. Some comrades have just gone down for a short while, and they are forcibly brought back on the pretext of "completing the teaching plan." Even during the period of going down to the countryside, they do not guide students to enhance their class struggle consciousness in the fiery mass movement, but instead talk a lot about "passing the test of living conditions," guiding students to overcome difficulties like "the difficulty of eating steamed buns" and "fear of mice squeaking."

The Chinese Khrushchev and his accomplices vehemently oppose the youth participating in class struggle, intending to turn the youth into politically indifferent individuals who do not care about national affairs, and into traitors to the dictatorship of the proletariat, becoming the successors of the bourgeoisie.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Class struggle, once grasped, is effective." In more than a year of the great turmoil of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, under the nurturing of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary youth are growing rapidly. A large number of previously unknown youth have become revolutionary pioneers. They are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The Chinese Khrushchev's dream of realizing capitalist restoration through the youth has completely collapsed!

Class struggle is the best classroom for us to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. Class struggle will forever be our main course for the youth. Let us closely follow our great leader Chairman Mao and forge ahead in the great wind and storm of class struggle!

    阶级斗争是我们的一门主课
    北京师范大学红卫兵　雷风行
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：“无产阶级革命事业的接班人，是在群众斗争中产生的，是在革命大风大浪的锻炼中成长的。”我们要以阶级斗争为主课，沿着毛主席指引的道路锻炼成长。
    中国赫鲁晓夫却公开鼓吹说：“国家建设工作，是我党在全国的中心工作，把党团中心工作转到国家建设上来。大的运动今后不可能有了，主要是集中精力搞经济建设。”他还胡说什么“青年团是学习的组织”，青年的任务就是“学习文化，学习技术”。党内另一个最大的走资派也把什么“劳动、学习、团结”作为“团的一个时期的方针”。他们绝口不提阶级斗争，妄图把青年引上修正主义的邪路。
    我校党内一小撮走资派也学着中国赫鲁晓夫的腔调，叫嚷什么学校是“传授知识”的地方，“学好专业是学生的政治任务”。他们提出：
  “团的思想工作必须落脚到教学。”在这种思想指导下，我校的团组织不抓同学学习毛主席著作，不抓阶级斗争，不抓青年的思想革命化。有的团支部过团日，组织团员向资产阶级反动学术“权威”求教什么“治学”方法。有的团支部以“如何上好一堂课”为主题，组织大家讨论。有的班过团组织生活，以所谓“树雄心，立壮志，攀登教育事业高峰”为题，引导大家大谈资产阶级的个人
  “理想”、“抱负”。更为严重的是，团组织还一度大搞“友谊舞会”、“时装展览会”，用资产阶级的“香风”、臭气腐蚀青年。照这样下去，革命的战斗的共青团岂不成为修正主义的“业务团”、“生活团”了吗！
    参加城乡社会主义教育运动，这是青年学生经受阶级斗争锻炼的一个大好机会。但是，我校党内一小撮走资派却极力加以阻挠。有些同学刚下去不久，他们就以“完成教学计划”为名，强行把同学拖回来。即使在下乡期间，他们也不是引导学生在火热的群众运动中增强阶级斗争观念，而是大讲“过生活关是主要的考验”，引导学生去克服什么“窝窝头难吃”和“怕老鼠叫”之类的“困难”。
    中国赫鲁晓夫及其同伙百般反对青年参加阶级斗争，就是要把青年一代变成不关心国家大事的政治上的庸人，变成背叛无产阶级专政的资产阶级接班人。
    毛主席教导我们：“阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”在一年多的无产阶级文化大革命的大风大浪中，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的哺育下，革命的青少年一代正在迅速地成长起来。一大批本来不出名的青少年成了革命的闯将。他们无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线。中国赫鲁晓夫妄图通过青年一代实现资本主义复辟的梦想彻底破产了！
    阶级斗争是我们活学活用毛主席著作的最好课堂，阶级斗争永远是我们青年的一门主课。让我们紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中奋勇前进！
