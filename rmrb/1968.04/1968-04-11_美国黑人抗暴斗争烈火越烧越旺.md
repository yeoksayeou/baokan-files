The struggle of American Black people against violence has spread like wildfire to 110 cities in the United States. The ferocity of this struggle, its scale, and the heavy blow it has dealt to American imperialism surpass any previous Black struggles. The terrified Johnson administration has mobilized 55,000 soldiers and National Guardsmen to suppress the uprising, with another 22,000 regular troops on standby. The American ruling class has never before deployed so many troops against domestic unrest. These facts fully demonstrate the unprecedented awakening of American Black people and the broad masses, the sharp intensification of class contradictions within the United States, and the hollow nature of American imperialism's external strength.

Imperialism and reactionaries have always relied on political deception and violent suppression to maintain their reactionary rule; primarily, they rely on violent suppression. When their political deception fails, they bring out the bayonets to intimidate and massacre the common people. However, "When the people are not afraid of death, how can they be frightened by it?" Once the oppressed people awaken, they neither believe the sweet talk of imperialism nor fear its violence, and they dare to take up arms to fight for their own liberation. Imperialists are then powerless. Today's reality is exactly this: it is not the awakened American Black people who fear the fully armed American reactionaries, but the fully armed American reactionaries who fear the awakened American Black people.

The great Lenin once said: "Once the masses have risen, once tens of millions have begun to act, then no persecution and no suppression can stop the movement. Persecution only provokes struggle and draws more and more new fighters into the struggle." Ultimately, the Johnson administration's savage suppression of the Black masses can only serve to promote the revolution. The brave Black masses have not only not been intimidated by the reactionaries' butcher knives, but through their struggle, they have seen more clearly that the American ruling class is their enemy, and they have strengthened their fighting will and enriched their fighting experience. This will create important conditions for the further development of the Black struggle.

Our great teacher Chairman Mao has pointed out: "The fascist atrocities of American imperialism against Black people have exposed the true nature of American so-called democracy and freedom, and revealed the internal connection between the reactionary policies of the American government at home and its aggressive policies abroad." American imperialism has always boasted of "peace," "democracy," and "freedom," but in reality, it uses violence as its primary means of oppressing people at home and abroad. The more it wants to aggressively invade abroad, the more ruthlessly it must suppress the resistance of its own people. The recent savage actions of the Johnson administration against American Black people once again show that American imperialism is the common enemy of the peoples of all countries, including the American people.

Therefore, the broad masses of American Black people who insist on armed struggle against violence are on the same front with the peoples of various countries who are fighting against American imperialism. The anti-American struggles of the peoples of various countries support the armed struggle of American Black people against violence; the struggle of American Black people against violence is also a powerful support for the anti-American struggles of the peoples of various countries. The American ruling class, in order to use heavy troops to brutally suppress the Black struggle against violence, had to announce the postponement of the plan to increase troops in South Vietnam, which is a good proof.

American imperialism has placed itself in a position of enmity with the American people and the people of the whole world, which inevitably provokes the people of the whole world, including the American people, to rise up and attack it. The anti-American struggles of the peoples of various countries are surging, inspiring, promoting, and encouraging each other, forming a powerful anti-imperialist revolutionary torrent. The accelerated demise of American imperialism is inevitable. The Soviet revisionist leadership, acting as a henchman of American imperialism, sabotages the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries. They too will not escape the same fate as American imperialism.

    美国黑人抗暴斗争烈火越烧越旺
    本报评论员
    美国黑人的抗暴斗争，有如一场燎原的烈火，已经蔓延到美国一百一十个城市。其来势之猛，规模之大，对美帝国主义打击之沉重，超过历年来的黑人斗争。惊恐万状的约翰逊政府，抽调了五万五千名陆军和国民警卫队进行镇压，还有二万二千名正规军准备随时出动。美国统治集团调动这样多的军队来对付国内人民的斗争，这是美国历史上罕见的。这些事实充分表明了美国黑人和广大人民的空前觉醒，表明了美国国内阶级矛盾的急剧激化，表明了美帝国主义外强中干的虚弱本质。
    帝国主义和反动派从来都是靠政治欺骗和暴力镇压来维持其反动统治的；而主要的是靠暴力镇压。当它的政治欺骗不中用的时候，就要把刺刀端出来，用以吓唬和屠杀老百姓。然而，“民不畏死，奈何以死惧之。”被压迫人民一旦觉醒起来，既不相信帝国主义的“好话”，也不害怕帝国主义的暴力，敢于拿起武器为自己的解放而斗争，帝国主义者就无能为力了。今天人们看到的事实正是这样：不是觉醒的美国黑人害怕全副武装的美国反动派，而是全副武装的美国反动派害怕觉醒的美国黑人。
    伟大的列宁曾经说过：“既然群众已经振作起来，既然千百万人已经开始行动起来，那末任何迫害和任何镇压都不能阻挡运动。迫害只能激起斗争，使愈来愈多的新战士卷入斗争。”归根结底，约翰逊政府对黑人群众的野蛮镇压只能起促进革命的作用。英勇的黑人群众不但没有被反动派的屠刀吓倒，而且通过自己的斗争更加看清了美国统治集团是他们的敌人，更加增强了自己的斗争意志，丰富了自己的斗争经验。这样就会给黑人斗争的进一步发展造成重要的条件。
    我们伟大的导师毛主席曾经指出：“美国帝国主义对黑人的法西斯暴行，揭穿了美国的所谓民主和自由的本质，暴露了美国政府在国内的反动政策和在国外的侵略政策之间的内在联系。”美帝国主义一向标榜什么“和平”、
  “民主”、“自由”，实际上是把暴力作为它压迫国内外人民的主要手段。它在国外越是要疯狂侵略，就必然越是残酷地镇压本国人民的反抗。约翰逊政府最近对美国黑人的穷凶极恶的行径，再一次表明了美帝国主义是各国人民，也是美国人民的共同敌人。
    因此，坚持武力抗暴斗争的美国广大黑人，同正在进行反美斗争的各国人民是站在一条战线上的。各国人民的反美斗争，支持了美国黑人的武力抗暴斗争；美国黑人的抗暴斗争，对于各国人民的反美斗争也是一个有力的支持。美国统治集团为了要用重兵残酷镇压的手段扑灭黑人抗暴斗争的烈火，不得不宣布暂缓执行增兵南越的计划，就是一个很好的证明。
    美帝国主义把自己置于同美国人民和全世界人民为敌的地位，这就必然要激起包括美国人民在内的全世界人民群起而攻之。世界各国人民的反美斗争风起云涌，互相激励，互相推动，互相鼓舞，汇成了一股强大的反帝革命洪流。美帝国主义的加速灭亡是不可避免的。苏修领导集团充当美帝国主义的帮凶，破坏各国人民的革命斗争，他们也逃脱不了同美帝国主义一样的命运。
