The main creators of the reactionary film "Storm Tide" are Peng Dehuai's cronies. They once used their authority to send some of our soldiers to Pingjiang to participate in the outdoor shooting of the film. Now, recalling some of the facts we heard and saw at that time, we can see the malicious intentions of the film's creators.

When the film began shooting, we heard that the title had been changed several times. Initially, it was called "Pingjiang Storm Tide," and finally, it was named "Storm Tide." We then asked the film's creators why the film, which was about Pingjiang, had removed the word "Pingjiang." They, having guilty consciences, did not dare to answer this question directly and only mumbled evasively. When we asked too many questions, they became aggressive and said, "Soldiers shouldn't meddle in so many things!" It turns out that this crony of Peng Dehuai wanted to both sing the praises of Peng Dehuai and avoid exposing his anti-party plots. Therefore, he had to use the trick of substituting one thing for another: under the guise of the Autumn Harvest Uprising, he peddled the goods of the "Pingjiang Uprising." Not using the name Pingjiang but shooting the story of Pingjiang, not mentioning the "Pingjiang Uprising" but actually writing about the "Pingjiang Uprising," this is their "secret."

The main creator of the film, to show his loyalty to his master, personally supervised the shooting in Pingjiang to recreate the scenes of the "Pingjiang Uprising" from back then. He hung a pair of binoculars around his neck every day, personally selecting the scenes. If anything did not meet his expectations, he would fly into a rage and order a reshoot until it met his anti-party purposes. The scene of attacking Liujia Bridge was shot like this under his personal supervision.

Under the personal supervision of the main creator of the film, all the old scenes of the "Pingjiang Uprising" were recreated. The city gate, the pagoda in the west of the city, the floating bridge in the east of the city, as well as the route taken by Qiu Jin to lead a large group of people in disguise to attack the city and the position of the pine tree cannon, were all arranged according to the scenes of Peng Dehuai's "Pingjiang Uprising" in July 1928. Through these scenes, they hinted to the audience that today's "Storm Tide" is the "Pingjiang Uprising" of yesterday, and the "great achievements" of Qiu Jin's gang on today's screen are the "meritorious deeds" of Peng Dehuai of yesterday. The film uses this to praise Peng Dehuai as the "revolutionary leader" of the Pingjiang area and to belittle the great significance of the "Autumn Harvest Uprising" led by our great leader Chairman Mao. However, history is something that no one can falsify.

The "Pingjiang Uprising" was initiated and promoted under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao's "Autumn Harvest Uprising" and was launched under the direct leadership of the Party. At that time, Peng Dehuai was still a butcher who suppressed the peasant movement. Later, he only participated in the uprising with the idea of "investing." Any schemer who dares to appropriate the merits of heaven for himself and attribute the achievements of the great leader Chairman Mao and the Party to himself will never succeed!

The main creator of the film, to be loyal to his master, also took every opportunity during the filming process to publicly praise Peng Dehuai. He personally led the actors to visit the old sites of the "Pingjiang Uprising" and explained the situation of the "Pingjiang Uprising." Where Peng Dehuai lived at that time, where he gave speeches, and how he gave speeches, all were introduced in detail. Once, he spoke to the soldiers participating in the filming of the movie and openly called on the soldiers to learn from Peng Dehuai's incarnations—Qiu Jin and Luo Dacheng. This crony of Peng Dehuai finally revealed his counter-revolutionary wolfish ambitions. What movie are they making? Isn't it blatantly advocating for Peng Dehuai's rehabilitation? Isn't it engaging in counter-revolutionary restoration activities!

"The vast ocean needs a helmsman, and the revolution needs Mao Zedong Thought." We, the People's Liberation Army, are the people's army created, led, and directly commanded by the great leader Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. We are most loyal to Chairman Mao, most loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and most loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Whoever opposes Chairman Mao and engages in counter-revolutionary restoration, we will resolutely overthrow them!

    《怒潮》炮制者的反革命用心
    解放军某部战士　龙静时
    反动影片《怒潮》的主要炮制者是彭德怀的死党。他曾经利用职权，派遣我们部队的一部分战士去平江参加外景的拍摄工作。现在从我们回忆当时耳闻目睹的一些事实，也可以看出影片炮制者的恶毒用心。
    影片开始拍摄时，我们听说剧名改过几次。最初叫《平江怒潮》，最后定为《怒潮》。我们便询问影片的炮制者，电影既然拍的是平江，为什么又去掉“平江”二字？他们因为心里有鬼，不敢正面回答这个问题，只是支支吾吾地搪塞。我们问多了，他就气势汹汹地说：“当兵的管那么多干啥！”原来这个彭德怀的死党，既要为彭德怀歌功颂德，又怕暴露其反党阴谋，因此不得不采取偷梁换柱的手法：打着秋收起义的幌子，贩卖“平江起义”的私货。不用平江的名字而拍摄平江的故事，不提“平江起义”而实写“平江起义”，这就是他们的“奥妙”所在。
    影片主要炮制者为了表示对其主子的忠心，使影片再现当年“平江起义”的旧景，竟亲自坐镇平江督阵。他每天挂着望远镜，亲自选择场景。如果哪一点不能满足他的心意，就大发雷霆，命令重来，一直到符合他的反党目的为止。当时拍摄攻打刘家桥的情景就是这样的。
    在这个影片主要炮制者的亲自督阵下，“平江起义”的一切旧景都重现了。影片中的城门，城西的宝塔，城东的浮桥，以及邱金率领大队人马化装攻城的路线和松树炮的位置，都是按彭德怀一九二八年七月“平江起义”的情景安排的。通过这些场面向观众暗示：今日的《怒潮》，就是当年的“平江起义”，今日银幕上邱金一伙的“丰功伟绩”，就是当年彭德怀的“汗马功劳”。影片以此把彭德怀吹捧为平江地区的“革命领袖”，贬低我们伟大领袖毛主席领导的“秋收起义”的伟大意义。但是，历史是任何人都篡改不了的。
  “平江起义”就是在毛主席亲自发动的“秋收起义”的影响和推动下，在党的直接领导下发动的。当时，彭德怀还是一个镇压农民运动的刽子手，后来他只不过是带着“入股”的思想，才参加了起义。任何野心家、阴谋家妄想贪天之功为己有，把伟大领袖毛主席和党的功绩记在自己的账上，是万万办不到的！
    影片主要炮制者为了效忠其主子，在影片拍摄过程中还找寻各种机会公开吹捧彭德怀。他亲自带领演员参观“平江起义”旧址，讲解“平江起义”的情况。彭德怀当时住在什么地方，在哪里讲过话，讲话的姿态如何等等，都不厌其烦地一一加以介绍。有一次他向参加拍摄影片的战士讲话，公然号召战士向彭德怀的化身——邱金、罗大成学习，这个彭德怀的死党，终于露出了反革命狼子野心。他们拍什么电影，不正是明目张胆地在为彭德怀翻案吗！不正是在搞反革命的复辟活动吗！
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”我们人民解放军是伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造、亲自领导和林副主席直接指挥的人民军队。我们最忠于毛主席，最忠于毛泽东思想，最忠于毛主席的革命路线，谁要是反对毛主席，搞反革命复辟，我们就坚决打倒他！
