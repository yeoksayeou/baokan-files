The revolutionary workers of Beijing Mining Bureau's Mucity Gorge Coal Mine, in the context of the excellent national situation, firmly remember the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, "Never forget class struggle," and vigorously carry out the revolutionary criticism. They moved the criticism meetings from the auditorium to the construction sites, underground, workshops, and dormitories, persistently launching attacks on the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the Mucity Gorge Coal Mine. This has strengthened the class and class struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary workers, raised their awareness of line struggle, and powerfully promoted all work. Recently, they have organized revolutionary workers to continuously and thoroughly criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's theory of "class struggle extinction," to resolutely strike down the rightist reversal wind blowing from the class enemies, and to resolutely strike down the various evil activities of the class enemies attempting to sabotage the new revolutionary regime. Below is a record of their criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev's "class struggle extinction" theory during a discussion meeting.

	Firmly Remember Class Bitterness and Never Forget Class Struggle

Vice Chairman Lin Biao said: "If you do not understand what class is, do not understand what exploitation is, you do not understand revolution." Once the Chinese Khrushchev's theory of "class struggle extinction" is mentioned, many old miners who have suffered deeply from the exploitation and oppression of the old society all gnash their teeth in hatred and rush to speak. Everyone unanimously pointed out: The evil purpose of the Chinese Khrushchev's propaganda of the "class struggle extinction" theory is to make us forget the past sufferings, forget class, and forget class struggle, so that they can freely carry out capitalist restoration. This is absolutely impossible, a thousand times impossible, a million times impossible! Even in today's excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must firmly remember class bitterness and never forget class struggle.

Li Fengming, an old miner with 43 years of service, said: Chairman Mao teaches us, "Never forget class struggle." However, the Chinese Khrushchev goes to great lengths to spread the "class struggle extinction" theory, wanting us to forget class struggle. This in itself is a sharp class struggle. We coal miners have suffered the most from the old society. To make us forget the past class bitterness is impossible. In the old society, we who pulled coal were called "coal blacks," and the exploitation and oppression we suffered cannot be described in a few days and nights. My father pulled coal for the capitalists all his life, but in the end, he still could not support his family. At the age of 14, I started working for the landlords, and by the time I was 19, I decided not to be exploited by the dog landlords anymore, so I went to work in the coal mines. But this was just jumping from one fire pit into another. The capitalists and landlords are the same, sucking our blood and sweat. It was the great savior Chairman Mao who rescued us from the fire pit. Never forgetting class bitterness after liberation, we think of the bitterness of the old society and feel even more the sweetness of the new society. When we carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and production, we have endless energy. The Chinese Khrushchev's attempt to use the "class struggle extinction" theory to blind us, make us forget our roots, and go back to the old ways is a pipe dream! Chairman Mao teaches us: "All reactionary things, if you do not beat them, they will not fall." If we do not criticize the "class struggle extinction" theory, it will not stink. We must use Mao Zedong Thought, the strongest and sharpest weapon, to criticize the reactionary fallacies spread by the Chinese Khrushchev, such as the "class struggle extinction" theory, criticizing it every day, every year, and criticizing it until it is worthless!

Chen Mingcheng, an old miner from the third mining section, said: The Chinese Khrushchev absurdly says, "The domestic enemies have basically been eliminated, the landlord class has long been eliminated," and "the main class struggle within the country has basically ended." I get angry just hearing this. This is clearly playing opposite to Chairman Mao's teachings. Chairman Mao said: After the completion of the socialist transformation in the ownership of the means of production, "the remnants of the overthrown landlord and comprador class still exist, the bourgeoisie still exists, and the petty bourgeoisie has just begun to be transformed. Class struggle has not ended." This is an absolute truth. From the land reform to now, the landlords and bourgeois elements have not had a single day of being honest. They are always thinking of restoring their lost paradise and dreaming of one day carrying out counter-revolutionary restoration. Even in today's excellent situation, the stubborn and unrepentant capitalist roaders and the untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists are still constantly plotting in the dark corners to overturn things. The Chinese Khrushchev's release of the "class struggle extinction" theory smoke screen is precisely to make us lose vigilance in class struggle and cover up the class enemies' attacks on us. We, on the other hand, must be diametrically opposed to the Chinese Khrushchev, firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings, and never forget class struggle!

	Criticize the Revisionist Line Promoted by Chinese Khrushchev in Factories and Mines

During the discussion meeting, the miners of Mucity Gorge Coal Mine used many specific examples to explain how a small group of capitalist roaders in the mine had actively promoted the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, launching a fierce attack on the working class. On the one hand, they proposed the slogan of "production first," implementing material incentives to numb and corrupt the broad masses of workers; on the other hand, they altered the nature of the party, recruiting some ghosts and snakes into the party, seizing power in the mine, and implementing bourgeois dictatorship.

Zhang Dongxue, an old miner from the fifth mining section, said: A small group of capitalist roaders in our mine, according to the instructions of the Chinese Khrushchev, said that the task of the party organization is first production, second production, and third still production; they said "left hand for tunneling, right hand for mining." They also proposed that breaking through 200 meters in mining and tunneling can "join the party on the front line," and safe operation of machinery for 15 days can be considered a minor merit, and a month can be considered a major merit, and so on, focusing on production methods. They talked about this first, that first, but did not talk about politics first; they talked about this lifeline, that lifeline, but did not talk about Mao Zedong Thought as the lifeline. Isn't this clearly trying to make us detach from politics and class struggle? Under such conditions where proletarian politics are not prominent, our mine once had such an incident: A counter-revolutionary with blood on his hands was evaluated as a model worker by the capitalist roaders. After this counter-revolutionary was exposed by the masses, he committed suicide out of fear, but the capitalist roaders still called on everyone to donate blood to him. Isn't this a very sharp class struggle? Isn't this saying that good production is good politics, and good production can blur the distinction between enemies and ourselves?

Shi Xiuwen, an old miner from the transportation section, said: The agents of the Chinese Khrushchev in our mine promoted the revisionist line and peddled many revisionist goods. They implemented material incentives, issued rewards left and right, and absurdly said, "Material incentives are beneficial to production," and "politics in command is not as fast as money." What nonsense is this? This is a complete slander against our working class! They want to lure us into the revisionist swamp with money and small favors, making us broad masses of workers only care about immediate and partial interests, only see rewards and money, and forget class and class struggle, forget proletarian dictatorship, forget socialism, and forget the great ideals of the working class. They want to corrupt the souls of our working class with money, turning us into confused people who do not ask about politics, to achieve their evil goal of restoring capitalism. We miners armed with Mao Zedong Thought will not fall for the tricks of the Chinese Khrushchev. We must always put proletarian politics first, never forget class struggle, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and be good miners.

Chen Jingtai, an old miner from the seventh mining section, said: Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The party organization should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat and should be a vigorous vanguard organization that leads the proletariat and revolutionary masses in the struggle against the class enemy." Under the education of our great leader Chairman Mao, we miners understand that a political party is a tool of class struggle, and the Communist Party is to carry out class struggle and implement proletarian dictatorship. However, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in our mine completely deny that the party is a tool of class struggle. In their party-building line, they implement a thorough revisionist party-building line. They want to turn the party, which is a tool of class struggle, into a tool of production struggle, abolishing class struggle, which is impossible.

An Changtai, a militia member of the coal mine's armed department, said: The miners of Mucity Gorge, from personal experience, realize that the capitalist roaders in our mine faithfully carried out the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist party-building line, recruiting traitors, spies, landlords, members of the Yiguandao sect, and capitalists into the party. They also absurdly said that having talent can join the party. What talent do these people have? Isn't it counter-revolutionary talent? A counter-revolutionary was recruited into the party by them and cultivated into a "red manager," but in reality, he was a black manager. Aren't these all living class struggle facts in front of our eyes?!

	The Newly Established Revolutionary Committee Must Grasp Class Struggle

After the establishment of the newly established revolutionary committee, does this mean there is no struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, and can we relax class struggle? The workers of Mucity Gorge Coal Mine discussed this issue in particular during their thorough criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev's "class struggle extinction" theory.

The establishment of the newly established revolutionary committee is a great victory for the revolutionary struggle of the proletarian revolutionary faction against a small group of capitalist roaders within the party, a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought. However, the Chinese Khrushchev and all class enemies are not reconciled to their failure. The traitors and spies who have infiltrated the revolutionary ranks, a small group of stubborn capitalist roaders within the party, and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have not been transformed in society are still constantly plotting, attempting to overthrow and sabotage the newly established revolutionary committee.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The enemy will not disappear by itself. Whether it is the reactionaries in China or the aggressive forces of American imperialism in China, they will not withdraw from the historical stage by themselves." During the discussion meeting, many miners analyzed the excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and at the same time, with their personal experiences, angrily exposed the class enemies' plots to overthrow the proletarian regime in the new situation, using more concealed and cunning methods to attack the newly established revolutionary committee.

Wu Lanko, an old miner from the second mining section, said: After the establishment of our mine's revolutionary committee, class struggle has never stopped. A small group of capitalist roaders within the party and some class enemies frantically attack the revolutionary committee. They use slander and defamation to undermine the authority of the revolutionary committee. We must resolutely resist and fight back. The most fundamental thing is to be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, and arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought. In this way, no matter what tricks the class enemies use to sabotage, we can see through them and defeat them thoroughly.

An Zhenliang, an old miner from the sixth mining section, said: In the excellent situation, we must not overlook the dark side. On the road of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution's victory, class struggle is always very sharp. The class enemies are struggling desperately and engaging in evil activities in the dark corners. We respond to the call of the revolutionary committee, learn from the experience of Beijing Knitting Factory in actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, and someone spreads malicious rumors behind our backs, saying this is formalism, attempting to sabotage the newly established revolutionary committee's use of Mao Zedong Thought to arm our coal miners. We must raise our class vigilance a thousand times, a million times, and never be complacent. The better the situation, the more we must never forget class struggle. In our mine, after the establishment of the newly established revolutionary committee, some hidden enemies still instigate the masses to make a fuss about welfare and wages. When the new red regime does not act according to their wishes, they curse the revolutionary committee. Isn't this class struggle? Our newly established revolutionary committee was born in the stormy waves of class struggle and must always firmly grasp the class struggle. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. If the enemy dares to sabotage, we must resolutely fight to the end! We must never relax our vigilance against the class enemies!

Li Jiu'an, an old miner from the seventh mining section, also said: In our mine, the newly established revolutionary committee calls on workers to strictly observe proletarian revolutionary discipline, adhere to the eight-hour work system, and strive to combine revolution with production. However, the class enemies spread anarchist fallacies, using various methods to attack the proletarian revolutionary faction that adheres to socialist labor discipline, directly pointing their spears at the newly established revolutionary committee, attempting to undermine the authority of the revolutionary regime and sabotage the revolution and production. They absurdly say, "Mark the line when you go to work, get the ticket at the end of the month, whether you adhere to the eight-hour system or not, it's the same." The class enemies want to sabotage labor discipline and make us not listen to the newly established revolutionary committee. We coal miners all deeply know that the newly established revolutionary committee is the command center leading us workers in class struggle, and we will not allow any enemy to harm and attack the authority of this command center.

Chen Jingtai, an old miner from the seventh mining section, said: I am a squad leader. I think I should take the lead in combining revolution with production, work hard, and support the newly established revolutionary committee, but someone, influenced by the class enemies, ridiculed me, saying, "You are a red manager," "You are seeking an official position, and we are seeking an early off-duty." Isn't this class struggle?

The revolutionary workers of Mucity Gorge Coal Mine unanimously expressed in the discussion that the class enemies, from the right or ultra-"left," shake and overthrow the revolutionary committee, and we must resolutely strike them down, defending the revolutionary regime with our lives. The more the enemy opposes the newly established revolutionary committee, the more we must cherish it, support it, and actively and enthusiastically help it with any shortcomings and errors that may appear in its growth, making it develop and improve continuously. Chairman Mao said: The revolutionary committee is good, and we must seriously implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

At the end of the discussion meeting, Zhang Hongji, the deputy chairman of the Mucity Gorge Coal Mine Revolutionary Committee, said: We must firmly establish the concept of class struggle among the broad masses of miners. We must resolutely defeat the class enemies who attempt to overthrow our newly established revolutionary committee, making them fall flat on their faces and never stand up again. You do not implement dictatorship over the class enemies, and they will implement dictatorship over you. Therefore, we must never pity the class enemies like poisonous snakes. We must never forget class struggle. Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we will persistently, deeply, and extensively carry out the revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticizing the "class struggle extinction" theory spread by the Chinese Khrushchev, and further consolidating our proletarian revolutionary regime.

    彻底批判“阶级斗争熄灭”论
    ——北京矿务局木城涧煤矿职工革命大批判座谈纪要
    北京矿务局木城涧煤矿的革命职工，在全国大好形势下，牢记伟大导师毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，狠抓革命大批判。把批判会从礼堂搬到工地、井下，搬到车间、宿舍，坚持不懈地向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在木城涧煤矿的代理人发起进攻，使广大革命职工加强了阶级和阶级斗争的观念，提高了路线斗争觉悟，有力地推动了各项工作。最近，他们又结合革命委员会建立以后阶级斗争的新形势，组织革命工人连续狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，迎头痛击从阶级敌人那里刮来的右倾翻案风，迎头痛击阶级敌人破坏新生的革命政权的种种罪恶活动。下面是他们批判中国赫鲁晓夫“阶级斗争熄灭”论的一次座谈会纪要。
      牢记阶级苦念念不忘阶级斗争
    林彪副主席说：“不懂得什么是阶级，不懂得什么是剥削，就不懂得革命。”一提到中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，许多饱尝旧社会剥削和压迫苦的老矿工，个个都恨得咬牙切齿，争先发言。大家一致指出：中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭”论的罪恶目的，就是要我们忘掉过去所受的苦，忘掉阶级，忘掉阶级斗争，好让他们放手去搞资本主义复辟。这一千个办不到，一万个办不到！就是在今天无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势下，也要牢记阶级苦，念念不忘阶级斗争。
    已经有四十三年工龄的老矿工李凤鸣说：毛主席教导我们“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”。可是中国赫鲁晓夫却千方百计散布“阶级斗争熄灭”论，要我们忘记阶级斗争，这本身就是尖锐的阶级斗争。我们煤矿工人受旧社会的苦最深，要我们忘掉过去的阶级苦，是办不到的。在旧社会，我们拉煤的，被人称为“煤黑子”，受的剥削和压迫几天几夜说不完。我父亲给资本家拉了一辈子煤，到头来还是养活不了一家人。我十四岁就给地主扛长活，干到十九岁，决心不受狗地主的剥削了，就到煤窑去做工。但这不过是从一个火坑跳到另一个火坑，资本家和地主一个样，敲骨吸髓榨取我们工人的血汗。是大救星毛主席把我们从火坑中救了出来。翻身不忘阶级苦，我们想起旧社会的苦，就更感到新社会的甜，搞起无产阶级文化大革命和生产来，浑身就有使不完的劲。中国赫鲁晓夫妄图用“阶级斗争熄灭”论来蒙住我们的眼睛，叫我们忘本，走回头路，这是痴心妄想！毛主席教导我们：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。”我们不批判“阶级斗争熄灭”论，它就不臭。我们要用毛泽东思想这个最强大最锐利的武器，对中国赫鲁晓夫所散布的“阶级斗争熄灭”论等反动谬论，天天批，年年批，批它个狗屎不如！
    采掘三段老矿工陈明成说：中国赫鲁晓夫胡说什么“现在国内敌人已经基本上被消灭，地主阶级早已消灭了”，“国内主要的阶级斗争已经基本上结束了”。我一听这话就冒火。这分明是和毛主席的教导唱对台戏。毛主席说：在生产资料所有制方面的社会主义改造完成之后，“被推翻的地主买办阶级的残余还是存在，资产阶级还是存在，小资产阶级刚刚在改造。阶级斗争并没有结束。”这是千真万确的真理。从土改到现在，地主、资产阶级分子不曾有一天老实过，他们时刻都想着恢复失去的天堂，梦想着有朝一日实行反革命复辟。就是在今天的大好形势下，顽固不化的走资派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子还无时无刻不在阴暗角落里盘算着翻天。中国赫鲁晓夫施放“阶级斗争熄灭”论的烟幕，正是要叫我们丧失阶级斗争的警惕性，掩护阶级敌人向我们进攻。我们呢，就是要和中国赫鲁晓夫针锋相对，牢记毛主席的教导，念念不忘阶级斗争！
      批臭中国赫鲁晓夫在厂矿推行的修正主义路线
    座谈会上，木城涧煤矿的矿工用许多具体事例说明，矿上一小撮走资派曾经积极推行中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，向工人阶级猖狂进攻。他们一方面提出“生产第一”的口号，大搞物质刺激，麻痹和腐蚀广大职工；另一方面篡改党的性质，拉一些牛鬼蛇神入党，掌握矿上大权，实行资产阶级专政。
    采掘五段老矿工张东学说，我们矿上一小撮走资派，按照中国赫鲁晓夫的意旨，说什么党组织的任务，第一是生产，第二是生产，第三还是生产；说什么“左手抓掘进，右手抓回采”。他们还提出采掘突破二百米便可以“火线入党”，机器安全生产十五天就立一小功，一个月就立一大功等等突出生产的办法。他们大谈这个第一，那个第一，就是不谈政治第一；大谈这是命根子，那是命根子，就是不谈毛泽东思想是命根子。这不是明明要我们脱离政治，脱离阶级斗争吗？在这种不突出无产阶级政治的情况下，我们矿上曾经发生过这样一件事情：一个有血债的反革命分子被走资派评为五好职工。这个反革命分子被群众揭发出来以后畏罪自杀，而走资派还号召大家给他输血。这难道不是十分尖锐的阶级斗争？难道不是生产好就是政治好，生产好就可以敌我不分了吗？
    运输段老矿工时秀文说：中国赫鲁晓夫在我们矿上的代理人推行修正主义路线，贩卖了许多修正主义黑货。他们大搞物质刺激，奖金挂帅，发这奖，发那奖，还胡说什么“物质刺激有利生产”，“政治挂帅不如奖金来的快”。这是什么话？这完完全全是对我们工人阶级的诬蔑！他们就是妄想用金钱和小恩小惠把我们骗到修正主义的泥坑里去，使我们广大职工只顾眼前的片面利益，只看到奖和钱，而忘记阶级和阶级斗争，忘记无产阶级专政，忘记社会主义，忘记工人阶级的远大理想。他们妄想用金钱腐蚀我们工人阶级的灵魂，把我们变成不问政治的糊涂虫，以达到他们复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。
    伟大导师毛主席教导我们：“决不可只看到眼前的片面的福利而忘记了工人阶级的远大利益。”经过两年来无产阶级文化大革命运动，我们深深懂得，奖金挂帅，越挂越坏。如果按照中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的修正主义道路走去，那就要象我们伟大领袖毛主席所指出的那样：“照此办理，那就不要很多时间，少则几年、十几年，多则几十年，就不可避免地要出现全国性的反革命复辟，马列主义的党就一定会变成修正主义的党，变成法西斯党，整个中国就要改变颜色了。”我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的矿工，绝不上中国赫鲁晓夫的当，我们一定要事事突出无产阶级政治，念念不忘阶级斗争，听毛主席的话，做毛主席的好矿工。
    采掘七段老矿工陈景泰说：伟大导师毛主席教导我们：“党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织。”我们矿工在伟大导师毛主席的教育下，懂得政党是阶级斗争的工具，共产党就是要搞阶级斗争，实行无产阶级专政。但是，中国赫鲁晓夫和他在我们矿上的代理人却一笔抹杀党是阶级斗争的工具。他们在建党路线上，贯彻的是一条彻头彻尾的修正主义建党路线。他们妄图把作为阶级斗争的工具的党演变为生产斗争的工具，取消阶级斗争，这是办不到的。
    煤矿武装部民兵安长太说：我们木城涧的矿工，从切身的体会中认识到，我们矿上的走资派，忠实地执行了中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线，把一些叛徒、特务、地主、一贯道分子、资本家也拉到党内来。还胡说什么有才能就可以入党。这些人有什么才能？难道不是反革命的才能。有个反革命分子被他们拉到党内后培养为“红管家”，实际是黑管家。这些不都是摆在我们眼前的活生生的阶级斗争事实吗？！
      新生的革命委员会要狠抓阶级斗争
    新生的革命委员会成立以后，是不是就没有两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争了，就可以放松阶级斗争了呢？木城涧煤矿的工人们在狠批中国赫鲁晓夫“阶级斗争熄灭”论时，特别对这个问题进行了座谈。
    新生的革命委员会的建立，是无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资派夺权斗争的伟大胜利，是毛主席的革命路线的伟大胜利，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。但是，中国赫鲁晓夫和一切阶级敌人对自己的失败是不甘心的。混入革命队伍内部的叛徒、特务，党内一小撮顽固不化的走资派，以及社会上没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，还时刻在伺机活动，妄图颠覆和破坏新生的革命委员会。
    毛主席教导我们：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。”座谈会上，许多矿工分析了当前无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，同时，用他们的亲身经历愤怒地揭露了阶级敌人在新形势下阴谋颠覆无产阶级的政权，采取了更加隐蔽的狡猾的手段，向新生的革命委员会进攻的事实。
    采掘二段老矿工武兰科说：我们矿山革命委员会建立以后，阶级斗争从没有停止过。党内一小撮走资派和一些阶级敌人疯狂地攻击革命委员会。他们用造谣诬蔑的手法，破坏革命委员会的威信。我们必须坚决抵制，坚决斗争。要斗争，最根本的就是要无限忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑。这样，不管阶级敌人用什么鬼花招来进行破坏，我们都能看得清，把他们彻底打败。
    采掘六段老矿工安振亮说：在大好形势下，我们绝不可不看到阴暗的一面。在无产阶级文化大革命胜利前进的道路上，阶级斗争始终是很尖锐的。阶级敌人在阴暗的角落里进行拚死的挣扎和罪恶的活动。我们响应革命委员会的号召，学习北京针织总厂活学活用毛主席著作经验，有人就背后煽阴风，说这是形式主义，妄图破坏新生的革命委员会用毛泽东思想武装我们煤矿工人。我们一定要千百倍地提高阶级警惕，千万不可麻痹大意。越是形势大好，我们越是要念念不忘阶级斗争。在我们矿上，新生的革命委员会成立以后，有的暗藏的敌人还挑动群众向革命委员会大闹福利待遇，大闹工资。新生的红色政权不能按照他们的意旨办事时，他们就谩骂革命委员会。这不就是阶级斗争吗？我们新生的革命委员会是在阶级斗争的大风浪中产生的，一定要始终紧紧抓住阶级斗争这条纲。要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，如果敌人胆敢破坏，就要和他们坚决斗争到底！千万不能放松对阶级敌人的警惕！
    采掘七段老矿工李久安也说：我们矿上，新生的革命委员会号召工人坚决遵守无产阶级的革命纪律，坚持八小时工作制，努力抓革命、促生产。但是，阶级敌人却大肆散布无政府主义谬论，采用各种手法，打击坚持社会主义劳动纪律的无产阶级革命派，把矛头直接指向新生的革命委员会，妄图破坏革命政权的威信，破坏革命和生产。他们胡说什么“上班划道，月底拿票，坚持不坚持八小时，都是一个样。”阶级敌人企图破坏劳动纪律，让我们不听新生的革命委员会的话。我们煤矿工人都深深知道，新生的革命委员会是领导我们工人群众进行阶级斗争的指挥部，我们绝不允许任何敌人来损害和攻击我们这个指挥部的权威。
    采掘七段老矿工陈景泰说：我是个班长。我想，我应该带头抓革命促生产，干好活，支持新生的革命委员会，可有人受了阶级敌人的利用，讽刺我说：“你是个红管家”，“你为了捞个官，我们为了早下班。”这不是阶级斗争又是什么！
    木城涧煤矿的革命工人，在座谈中一致表示，阶级敌人从右的或极“左”的方面动摇、颠覆革命委员会，我们就要坚决打击它，用生命保卫革命政权。敌人愈是反对新生的革命委员会，我们就愈要爱护它、支持它，对它在成长中可能出现的缺点和错误，要积极热情地帮助，使它不断地发展和完善。毛主席说：革命委员会好，我们就要认真地落实毛主席的最新指示。
    座谈会结束时，木城涧煤矿革命委员会副主任张洪吉说：我们一定要在广大矿工中把阶级斗争的观念牢牢地树起来。要坚决把妄图颠覆我们新生的革命委员会的阶级敌人打得人仰马翻，叫他永世不得翻身。对阶级敌人你不实行专政，他就要对你实行专政。所以，我们绝不能怜惜毒蛇一样的阶级敌人。要念念不忘阶级斗争。在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，把革命的大批判持久地深入地广泛地开展下去，把中国赫鲁晓夫散布的“阶级斗争熄灭”论批深批透，进一步巩固我们无产阶级的革命政权。
