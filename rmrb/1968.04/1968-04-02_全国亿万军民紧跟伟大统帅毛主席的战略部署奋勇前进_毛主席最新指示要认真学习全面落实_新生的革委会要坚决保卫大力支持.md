All the people and soldiers of the nation are following the strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao and advancing courageously. The latest instructions from Chairman Mao must be studied seriously and implemented comprehensively. The newly established revolutionary committees must be resolutely defended and strongly supported.

We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "Never forget class struggle." We must resolutely strike down all class enemies who attempt to shake and overthrow the revolutionary committees from the right or the ultra-left, and defend the dictatorship of the proletariat.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on April 1st, revolutionary masses and broad revolutionary groups across the nation are studying, propagating, and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions with great enthusiasm. Chairman Mao recently issued the great instruction: "The basic experience of the revolutionary committees has three points: one is having representatives of revolutionary cadres, one is having representatives of the army, and one is having representatives of revolutionary masses, thus realizing the three-in-one combination. The revolutionary committees must implement unified leadership, break down the overlapping administrative organs, streamline the bureaucracy, and organize a revolutionary leadership cadre that is connected with the masses." Broad revolutionary masses have resolutely expressed that they will implement Chairman Mao's brilliant latest instructions. For the three-in-one combination revolutionary committees, they will cherish them with all their hearts, support them unshakably, actively and enthusiastically help them, and bravely defend them. They will make the newly born revolutionary committees into command posts that hoist the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and lead the proletariat and revolutionary masses to advance courageously.

Currently, 18 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the nation have successively established revolutionary committees, and some regions are preparing to establish revolutionary committees. Revolutionary committees at the prefecture, county, and grassroots levels are springing up like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. Broad revolutionary masses, while studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, excitedly say that the unprecedented great situation of the nationwide Cultural Revolution is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! They resolutely express that they will follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, further comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, consolidate and develop the great alliance and the three-in-one combination of the revolution, carry out the great criticism of the revolution, and do a good job of the struggle, criticism, and reform in their units to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

In Shanghai, the birthplace of the "January Revolution," a wave of studying, propagating, and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions has swept from the urban areas to the suburbs in recent days. The conference of active learners and propagators of Mao Zedong Thought in Shanghai in 1968 is underway, serving as a class on studying Mao Zedong Thought. Leaders of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee have gone to various representative groups to study Chairman Mao's brilliant latest instructions with the representatives. Zhang Chunqiao, a responsible person of the municipal revolutionary committee, said at the meeting that Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the three-in-one combination point out the fundamental direction of our proletarian dictatorship construction and are a great program to strengthen the proletarian dictatorship and prevent capitalist restoration. Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions have immeasurable guiding significance for how our revolutionary committees at all levels should hold power and use power well. He urged the representatives attending the conference and all revolutionary people of the city to seriously study and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution. Xue Hongfu, deputy head of the Qinghai Provincial Revolutionary Committee, excitedly talked about his experience of learning from military representatives and representatives of revolutionary masses after participating in the work of the revolutionary committee. He said that the revolutionary committee combines the three-eight spirit of the PLA, the hardworking and struggling qualities of the working people, and the fine tradition of our party's connection with the masses, giving the revolutionary committee boundless vitality. Hua Yinfeng, deputy head of the Zhejiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee and a model agricultural worker, said: "Father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao's instructions are a guiding light, illuminating our path forward. We must act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, closely connect with the masses, and use the great Mao Zedong Thought to hold power and use power well!"

Revolutionary masses in various places have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the three-in-one combination, and they love the newly born revolutionary committees even more. They shout over and over again: "Revolutionary committees are good! Revolutionary committees are really good!" They say that the great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: The three-in-one combination revolutionary committees are a creation of the proletariat and the people in this cultural revolution. Over the past year, the revolutionary committees have shown vigorous and strong vitality in leading the proletariat and revolutionary masses in the struggle against class enemies. For the newly born revolutionary committees, we must cherish them, support them, help them develop and improve continuously. Workers from the Beijing Paper Mill said that we must follow what Comrade Li Wentong said: "Where Chairman Mao loves, I love; where Chairman Mao supports, I support; where Chairman Mao instructs, I act; where Chairman Mao waves his hand, I advance." Chairman Mao says revolutionary committees are good, so we must cherish and support the revolutionary committees and resolutely do nothing that is not beneficial to the revolutionary committees. Workers from the Datong Coal Mine said that the Datong Coal Mine Revolutionary Committee was born in the storm of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. With the help of the People's Liberation Army, the revolutionary committee held classes to study Mao Zedong Thought and quickly conveyed Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions to us workers. We coal miners love Chairman Mao the most. Chairman Mao says revolutionary committees are good, so we must resolutely cherish the revolutionary committees and support the revolutionary committees. The poor peasants of Xipu Village, Jianming Commune, Zunhua County, Hebei Province, excitedly said that in the past, under Chairman Mao's guidance, we walked on the broad road of socialism. We deeply feel that following Chairman Mao is victory! Chairman Mao says revolutionary committees are good, which speaks to the hearts of us poor and lower-middle peasants. We poor and lower-middle peasants resolutely support, cherish, and help the revolutionary committees. We must further comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Shiyang People's Commune in the suburbs of Nanjing, which Chairman Mao once inspected, said: The three-in-one combination revolutionary committees are a great creation of this proletarian cultural revolution and a new thing. We must cherish it and support it. In its growth process, there may be shortcomings and mistakes, and we should actively and enthusiastically propose criticisms and suggestions to help it develop and improve continuously. Revolutionary teachers and students of Jiangxi Normal University pointed out that what attitude to take towards the newly born revolutionary committees is an issue of attitude towards the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, towards Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and towards Chairman Mao's latest instructions. We Red Guards must always be loyal to Chairman Mao, consciously overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchism, strengthen proletarian party spirit, enhance class struggle awareness, resolutely support the work of the revolutionary committees, and make the revolutionary committees play a greater role in leading the proletariat and broad revolutionary masses to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

Revolutionary masses in various places, while studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the three-in-one combination, expressed that they would further establish and run well classes to study Mao Zedong Thought, take "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the key, further comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution. Revolutionary masses in regions and units that have established revolutionary committees have taken practical actions to support the revolutionary committees, making them play a great revolutionary role in the great struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

Some factories in Zhengzhou are preparing to immediately hold special classes to study Mao Zedong Thought to implement Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions on the three-in-one combination, ensuring that the revolutionary committees are built into revolutionary leadership cadres that are connected with the masses according to Chairman Mao's teachings. Revolutionary workers of the Guangzhou Municipal Electric Tram Company, after studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, immediately formulated measures to improve the order of trams to support the revolutionary committees with practical actions to improve production. Revolutionary workers of Anshan Steel said that the revolutionary committees are the political power of our working class, and we must support them, help them, cherish them, and defend them with the most active attitude and greatest strength. Revolutionary masses in Hunan, Shaanxi, Ningxia, Sichuan, Guangxi, Anhui, and Xinjiang provinces and autonomous regions excitedly expressed that in the face of the great situation across the nation, Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the three-in-one combination are the greatest encouragement, education, and motivation for us. We must, with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, comprehensively implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, promote the great alliance and the three-in-one combination of the revolution, and strive to establish provincial and autonomous regional revolutionary committees as soon as possible.

Revolutionary masses in various places, while studying, propagating, and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, maintain high revolutionary vigilance against class enemies. They say: Class enemies do not resign themselves to their failure, and we must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "Never forget class struggle." We must resolutely strike down all class enemies who attempt to shake and overthrow the revolutionary committees from the right or the ultra-left, and defend the dictatorship of the proletariat.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on April 1st, broad cadres and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, while deeply studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the revolutionary committees, firmly expressed that they will resolutely cherish, support, help, and defend the new things that have emerged in the Cultural Revolution—the revolutionary committees, making them play an even greater role in leading the proletariat and revolutionary masses to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution. They will make our proletarian dictatorship more able to withstand any storm and more able to smash the plots of all domestic and foreign class enemies.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "The basic experience of the revolutionary committees has three points: one is having representatives of revolutionary cadres, one is having representatives of the army, and one is having representatives of revolutionary masses, thus realizing the three-in-one combination. The revolutionary committees must implement unified leadership, break down the overlapping administrative organs, streamline the bureaucracy, and organize a revolutionary leadership cadre that is connected with the masses." In recent days, broad cadres and fighters of the PLA, with deep proletarian feelings of loyalty to Chairman Mao, have repeatedly studied and deeply understood Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions. Many cadres and fighters of various general departments, military branches, and units have gone to factories, villages, and streets to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions and express their resolute support for the revolutionary committees. Broad cadres and fighters of the PLA stationed in Beijing, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Lanzhou, Jinan, Wuhan, and Chengdu, who are on the front line of "three supports and two militaries," have studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions with revolutionary masses and, in combination with practical struggles, seriously studied measures to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

In places and units where revolutionary committees have been established, cadres and fighters executing the "three supports and two militaries" tasks are determined to bring the good experience of the PLA in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing proletarian politics, adhering to the four firsts, and promoting the three-eight spirit to the revolutionary committees. The First Normal School of Hunan Province, where the great leader Chairman Mao once studied and engaged in revolutionary activities, is the first unit in large and medium-sized schools in Changsha to establish a revolutionary committee. The "Iron Second Company" stationed here, with Lin Biao as the first company commander, has repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and actively passed on the political and ideological work experience of the troops to the revolutionary committee. They said that they must take Comrade Lin Biao as a shining example, better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, seriously implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and use Mao Zedong Thought to build the revolutionary committee into a revolutionary and connected-with-the-masses fighting command post that is absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao. The naval propaganda team stationed in the Tianjin fishery system, in response to the situation where some committee members of the revolutionary committee in this system are busy with affairs and less involved with the masses and participate in labor, studied with the committee members Chairman Mao's teachings on "We communists are not to be officials, but to make revolution" and "We must adhere to the mass line, consult with the masses on everything, and be small students of the masses," making the members of the revolutionary committee consciously maintain the style of the working people. The support-left group stationed at the Xinanjiang Hydropower Plant, while celebrating the birth of the Zhejiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee, received Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the revolutionary committees and immediately studied and discussed with the proletarian revolutionary factions. They said that Chairman Mao's latest instructions point out the fundamental direction for the construction of the revolutionary committees. In the past, we relied on Chairman Mao's latest instructions to help the power plant establish a revolutionary committee, and in the future, we will rely on Chairman Mao's latest instructions to help develop and consolidate the revolutionary committee, making it play a great revolutionary role in the great struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

Military representatives participating in various levels of revolutionary committees have, in recent days, studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the revolutionary committees with excitement and are determined to, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, strengthen the construction of the revolutionary committees. Military representatives of the Jiangxi Brick and Tile Factory Revolutionary Committee, together with revolutionary cadre representatives and revolutionary mass representatives, studied Chairman Mao's discussions on class and class struggle, raised their awareness of class struggle and line struggle, and made the revolutionary committee tempered in the storm of class struggle. While studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the revolutionary committees, they are determined to follow the fundamental direction pointed out by Chairman Mao for the construction of the revolutionary committees and build the revolutionary committee into a revolutionary leadership cadre that is connected with the masses. Yan Yufu, an active learner and propagator of Mao Zedong Thought from the Wuhan troops and deputy head of the Zaozhuang Revolutionary Committee, has studied with the masses, conducted revolutionary criticism, and charged into the front lines of class struggle in the past. After studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the revolutionary committees, he firmly remembers Chairman Mao's teachings: "The reform of state organs, the most fundamental point, is to connect with the masses." He is determined to, together with other committee members, deeply root himself among the masses, always represent the interests of the masses, and serve the people wholeheartedly. Many military representatives of revolutionary committees in the Hohhot region, together with other members of the revolutionary committees, compared their work with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, checked their previous work, found problems, and formulated measures to improve their work. Many military representatives of various levels of revolutionary committees in Shanghai, while studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, also exchanged work experience and are determined to, together with revolutionary cadre representatives and revolutionary mass representatives, build various levels of revolutionary committees into revolutionary headquarters that are absolutely loyal to Chairman Mao and have proletarian revolutionary authority.

In places where revolutionary committees have not yet been established, broad cadres and fighters executing the "three supports and two militaries" tasks are leading broad revolutionary masses to seriously study Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the revolutionary committees and a series of latest instructions, developing and consolidating the great alliance of the revolution, promoting the three-in-one combination of the revolution, and striving to establish revolutionary committees as soon as possible. Yang Dingshan, an active learner and propagator of Mao Zedong Thought from a certain unit of the Guangxi garrison, said: Chairman Mao's latest instructions point out the fundamental direction for our support-left work and give us a powerful ideological weapon. We must study it well, use it well, and propagate it well to contribute to the early establishment of the Guangxi Revolutionary Committee. The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team from a certain unit stationed in Changsha No. 1 Middle School regards Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a guiding light. They combine actual conditions, repeatedly study, and unanimously believe that to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we must focus on class struggle and carry out revolutionary criticism to isolate the enemy, unite the masses, achieve the great alliance and the three-in-one combination of the revolution. They immediately took action, went to various classes, and studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions with broad revolutionary teachers and students, launching a wave of revolutionary criticism, eliminating interference from the right and the ultra-left, and promoting the establishment of the revolutionary committee.

Broad cadres and fighters stationed on the coastal and border defense fronts in Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Tibet, and Xinjiang, while seriously studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the revolutionary committees, reviewed Chairman Mao's great teachings: "All reactionary forces, when they are about to perish, will always make desperate struggles." They unanimously pointed out that all domestic and foreign reactionaries hate the newly born revolutionary committees to death and fear the further consolidation of our proletarian dictatorship to death. They will definitely crazily carry out sabotage and disruption. We must increase our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, strengthen our preparedness, and use our blood and lives to defend our motherland, defend the Cultural Revolution, and defend the revolutionary committees scattered across the country.

  毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进。”毛主席说革命委员会好，我们就要爱护和支持革命委员会，坚决做到不利于革命委员会的话不说，不利于革命委员会的事不做。大同煤矿的革命职工说，大同煤矿革命委员会是在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的风浪中成长起来的。在人民解放军帮助下，革命委员会大办毛泽东思想学习班，把伟大领袖毛主席的一系列最新指示迅速交给了我们工人群众。我们矿工最热爱毛主席，毛主席说革命委员会好，我们就要坚决爱护革命委员会，支持革命委员会。河北省遵化县建明公社西铺大队当年“穷棒子社”的老贫农们激动地说，过去，我们在毛主席的指引下，走上了社会主义的康庄大道。我们深深体会到，紧跟毛主席就是胜利！毛主席说革命委员会好，这句话说到了我们贫下中农的心坎上。我们贫下中农坚决支持、爱护和帮助革命委员会，我们一定要进一步全面落实毛主席的最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。我们伟大领袖毛主席曾经视察过的南京市郊区十月人民公社的贫下中农说：“三结合”的革命委员会，是这次无产阶级文化大革命中的一个伟大创造，是一个新生事物，我们一定要爱护它，支持它。在它的成长过程中，也可能出现缺点和错误，我们应该积极地、热情地提出批评建议，帮助它不断发展和完善。江西师范学院的革命师生指出，对待新生的革命委员会采取什么态度，这是对待以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部、对待毛主席的无产阶级革命路线、对待毛主席最新指示的态度问题。我们红卫兵要永远忠于毛主席，要自觉地克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和无政府主义，增强无产阶级党性，加强阶级斗争观念，坚决支持革命委员会的工作，使革命委员会在率领无产阶级和广大革命群众夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中，发挥更大的作用。
