Since the beginning of this year, as the Vietnam War has been continuously "escalated," the U.S. imperialists have tightened their exploitation and oppression of the domestic people. Especially with the heavy casualties among U.S. troops in Vietnam and the dwindling supply of soldiers, the U.S. ruling class has intensified conscription and recruited cannon fodder at home. The contradictions between U.S. imperialism and the American people have intensified, and the people's movement against the Vietnam War has shown significant development.

Our great teacher Chairman Mao said: "The U.S. reactionaries want to stir up war, and they must first attack the American people. They have already attacked the American people, politically and economically oppressing the workers and democrats in the United States, preparing to implement fascism in the United States. The American people should rise up to resist the attack by the U.S. reactionaries."

In the American people's anti-conscription movement, the broad masses of young students are an important force. On February 16, the U.S. Selective Service System announced new conscription regulations, abolishing the previous deferment for college graduates, graduate students, and professionals engaged in important work, in order to expand the pool of recruits. According to the new conscription regulations, in the next fiscal year, 150,000 college graduates will be conscripted, accounting for about two-thirds of the total number of conscripts (previously 5%), and one-third of them will be sent to the Vietnam battlefield to serve as cannon fodder.

The new conscription regulations have sparked a strong anti-conscription wave among the broad masses of young students in the United States. Now, college students openly discuss the issue of refusing to be conscripted. In most universities, anti-conscription organizations have been and are being established, and the number of students refusing to be conscripted is increasing. Students disrupt the conscription work by boycotting and "disturbing" the conscription offices and recruitment stations, and by escaping to other countries, feigning illness, or going to jail to avoid military service. The number of people escaping to other countries has significantly increased in the past three to four months. The young students' movement against the Vietnam War and against conscription has received widespread sympathy and support from various strata of society.

In the American people's struggle against the Vietnam War, the American Black people are playing an increasingly important role.

In order to expand the Vietnam War, the U.S. ruling class not only intensifies the exploitation and plunder of the broad masses of Black people but also uses various barbaric methods to force large numbers of Black people to the Vietnam battlefield to serve as cannon fodder. Black people account for 11% of the U.S. population, but in the U.S. troops in Vietnam, Black people account for about 25%. This cannot but provoke strong resistance from the increasingly awakened Black masses. In some U.S. universities, the movement of Black people against the Vietnam War has been relatively active. Last March, when the head of the U.S. Selective Service System, Hersh, gave a speech at Howard University, where Black students are in the absolute majority, he was immediately driven away by the angry students. In many cities' Black neighborhoods, the activities against the Vietnam War are developing rapidly. In places like Los Angeles and Chicago, Black people have established organizations against aggressive wars and conscription, frequently holding various meetings, demonstrating in front of conscription stations, or screening films against the Vietnam War. The Black masses in the United States have also established national organizations and actively carried out activities, calling for American Black people to refuse military service and urging U.S. troops in Vietnam to oppose the Vietnam War.

In the recent mass movement against the Vietnam War, the American people have simultaneously raised the slogans of opposing the Vietnam War and opposing racial discrimination. In the masses, there have even appeared such clear slogans: to oppose the Vietnam War, one must oppose the imperialist system of the United States. This indicates that the level of awareness of the American people is further improving.

In early April this year, the American Black people launched an unprecedented wave of anti-violence struggles. Following this, the American telecommunications workers went on a strike that had not occurred in more than twenty years. Now, the American people's struggle against the Vietnam War is surging again. On April 26 and 27, major cities in New York, Chicago, Washington, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Georgia, Ohio, and California launched large-scale demonstrations against the Vietnam War and racial oppression. The vigorous development of the people's struggle within the United States is a prominent reflection of the current political and economic crises of U.S. imperialism and, in turn, deals a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialism that is in a predicament both domestically and internationally.

Our great teacher Chairman Mao recently issued a great call in a statement supporting the anti-violence struggle of the American Black people: "The people of the world should unite more closely, launch a sustained and fierce offensive against our common enemy, U.S. imperialism, and its accomplices!" At present, U.S. imperialism has already been surrounded by the people of the world, including the American people. Its days of being buried are not far off! (Accompanying photo)

### 美国人民掀起反对侵越战争的怒涛

    美国人民掀起反对侵越战争的怒涛
    今年以来，随着侵越战争的不断“升级”，美帝国主义对国内人民的剥削和压迫步步加紧。特别是侵越美军伤亡惨重，兵源日益枯竭，美国统治集团在国内加紧征兵，搜罗炮灰。美帝国主义同美国人民之间的矛盾日益加剧，美国人民反对侵越战争的群众运动有了显著的发展。
    我们的伟大导师毛主席说：“美国反动派要掀动战争，首先必须进攻美国人民。他们已经在进攻美国人民了，他们从政治上、经济上压迫美国的工人和民主分子，准备在美国实行法西斯主义。美国人民应当起来抵抗美国反动派的进攻。”青年学生的反征兵运动
    在美国人民反征兵运动中，广大青年学生是一支重要的力量。美国征兵局今年二月十六日宣布新的征兵条例，废除过去对大学毕业生、研究生和从事重要工作的专业人员的缓征办法，以扩大兵源。根据新的征兵办法，在下一个财政年度将有十五万名大学毕业生应征入伍，约占应征总人数的三分之二
  （过去为百分之五），他们中的三分之一的人将被送往越南战场充当炮灰。
    新的征兵条例在美国广大青年学生中激起了强烈的反征兵浪潮。现在，大学生公开地谈论拒绝应征的问题。在大多数大学里已经和正在组织反征兵团体，拒绝应征的学生越来越多。学生们通过抵制和“扰乱”征兵局和新兵入伍站等办法，破坏征兵工作的进行，并用逃往国外、装病、坐牢等方式逃避兵役。逃往国外的人数最近三四个月来显著增加。青年学生的反对侵越战争和反征兵运动，得到社会上广泛阶层的同情和支持。美国黑人积极反对侵越战争在美国人民反对侵越战争的斗争中，美国黑人正起着越来越重要的作用。
    美国统治集团为了扩大侵越战争，不仅加紧对广大黑人群众的剥削和掠夺，而且还用各种野蛮方式强迫大批黑人到南越战场去充当炮灰。黑人占美国人口的百分之十一，可是在侵越美军中，黑人却占了约百分之二十五。这就不能不遭到日益觉醒的黑人群众的强烈反抗。在美国一些大学里，黑人反对侵越战争的运动一直比较活跃。去年三月，美国征兵局头子赫尔希到黑人学生占绝大多数的霍华德大学演说，当即被愤怒的学生轰走。在很多城市的黑人区里，反对侵越战争的活动也发展很快。洛杉矶、芝加哥等地的黑人成立了反侵略战争、反征兵等组织，经常举行各种集会，在征兵站前示威或放映反对侵越战争的电影。美国黑人群众还成立了全国性的组织，积极展开活动，要求美国黑人拒服兵役，并且呼吁侵越美军士兵反对侵越战争。
    在最近的反对侵越战争的群众运动中，美国人民同时提出了反对侵越战争和反对种族歧视的口号；在群众中甚至出现了这样明确的口号：为了反对侵越战争就必须反对美国的帝国主义制度。这标志着美国人民的觉悟程度，正在进一步提高。
    今年四月初，美国黑人掀起了空前未有的抗暴斗争的新风暴。接着，美国电讯工人举行了二十多年未曾有过的大罢工。现在，美国人民反对侵越战争的斗争怒潮又汹涌而起。四月二十六日、二十七日纽约、芝加哥、华盛顿、康涅狄格、马萨诸塞、佐治亚、俄亥俄和加利福尼亚州许多重要城市掀起了大规模的抗议侵越战争和种族压迫的示威游行。美国国内人民斗争的蓬勃发展，是美帝国主义当前整个政治危机和经济危机的突出反映，并且又给陷于内外交困的美帝国主义以沉重的打击。
    我们伟大的导师毛主席最近在支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明中发出伟大的号召：“全世界人民更紧密地团结起来，向着我们的共同敌人美帝国主义及其帮凶们发动持久的猛烈的进攻！”目前，美帝国主义已经陷入了包括美国人民在内的全世界人民的重重包围之中，它被埋葬的日子已经不远了！（附图片）
    四月二十六日，美国纽约人民举行示威游行，反对美帝侵越战争和种族歧视。
