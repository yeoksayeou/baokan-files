The broad masses of commune members in Hongqi Production Brigade, Zhaoqing Suburban People's Commune, Guangdong Province, have, during the spring plowing season, overcome the idea of relying solely on chemical fertilizers supplied by the state and launched a campaign to accumulate large amounts of farmyard manure, achieving remarkable results. How did this manure accumulation campaign come about?

Originally, due to the fact that Khrushchev and his agents in Guangdong had pushed a revisionist line in agricultural production, they suppressed the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and thrift among the broad masses of commune members, causing some commune members to develop the idea of relying solely on chemical fertilizers supplied by the state for production. At the beginning of this year's plowing season, some commune members still said: "Our brigade lacks fertilizer. To strive for a bumper harvest of grain and to plant vegetables to supply the city, how can we manage without the state supplying more chemical fertilizers?" After discovering this idea, the brigade leadership thought: Should we rely solely on chemical fertilizers supplied by the state to do a good job in spring plowing production? Or should we emphasize proletarian politics and rely on our own efforts to do a good job in spring plowing production? If this problem is not solved, it will be impossible to fully mobilize the production enthusiasm of the commune members, achieve a bumper harvest this year, or guide the commune members to correctly follow the path of self-reliance in building socialism. Therefore, they immediately organized a class to study Mao Zedong Thought, attended by militiamen, commune members, and cadres. Through the study, the ideological awareness of the commune members was greatly raised. Some commune members said: "Our production team received 5,000 jin of chemical fertilizers from the state two years ago. Because political work was not emphasized enough, the team accumulated less farmyard manure and miscellaneous fertilizers. In addition, field management was poor, resulting in a decrease in yield. Last year, only 1,000 jin of chemical fertilizers were purchased. However, due to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the ideological revolution of the commune members was promoted, everyone contributed more farmyard manure, accumulated more miscellaneous fertilizers, and strengthened field management. The grain yield increased by 40% compared to the previous year, achieving an unprecedented bumper harvest in history. This fact fully proves that only by arming our minds with Mao Zedong Thought and following the self-reliant path of Dazhai can agricultural production be well done."

With the improvement of understanding, the enthusiasm of the commune members for accumulating manure was greatly aroused. During the spring plowing season, some commune members got up at around four in the morning to go several kilometers away to accumulate miscellaneous fertilizers, while others used their lunch breaks and other rest times to go outside to dig garbage piles, clean sewage ditches, and pick up wild dung. The farmyard manure contributed to the collective this year is more than in any previous year.

Through this study, the idea of thrift and self-reliance has taken root in people's minds, not only solving the current problem of insufficient fertilizer, but also bringing other work in the spring plowing season into full swing. Currently, the entire brigade's production is in full swing, and all the commune members are full of confidence in striving for an even greater bumper harvest this year.

    克服单纯依赖化肥思想自力更生大积农家肥料
    我们广东肇庆市郊区公社红旗大队广大社员在春耕生产中，大破依赖国家供应化肥的思想，掀起了一个大积农家肥的高潮，取得了很大成绩。这个积肥高潮是怎样开展起来的呢？
    原来，我们这里由于中国赫鲁晓夫及其在广东的代理人在农业生产中推行一条修正主义路线，扼杀广大社员自力更生，勤俭办社的革命精神，使得一些社员产生了单纯依赖国家供应化肥搞生产的思想。在今年开耕时，有些社员还说：我们队里肥料不足，要争取粮食丰收，又要种蔬菜供应城市，国家不多供应点化肥怎么行？大队领导班子发现这种思想后，认为：是单纯依赖国家供应化肥搞好春耕生产？还是靠突出无产阶级政治，自力更生搞好春耕生产？这个问题不解决好，就不可能充分调动社员的生产积极性，夺取今年农业大丰收，也不能引导社员正确地走自力更生建设社会主义的道路。于是，他们立即举办了有民兵、社员、干部参加的毛泽东思想学习班。通过学习，社员的思想觉悟有很大提高。有的社员说：“我们生产队，前年国家供应五千斤化肥，由于突出政治不够，队里农家肥、土杂肥就积少了，加上田间管理不好，结果减了产。去年只买了一千斤化肥，但是由于经过无产阶级文化大革命，促进了社员思想革命化，大家多交农家肥，大积土杂肥，又加强了田间管理，粮食产量比前年增加了百分之四十，获得了历史上空前的大丰收。这个事实充分说明，只有用毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑，走大寨自力更生的道路，农业生产才能搞好。”
    认识提高了，社员积肥的积极性大大调动起来了。在进行春耕生产的同时，有的社员清早四点多钟就起床，到几公里远的地方去积土杂肥，有的社员利用中午和其他休息时间，到外面去挖垃圾堆，清污水沟，拾野粪。社员今年交给集体的农家肥比以往任何一年都多。
    通过这一学习，勤俭办社、自力更生的思想深入人心，不但解决了当前肥料不足的问题，而且把春耕中的其他各项工作也带动起来，目前全大队的生产搞得热火朝天，全体社员充满信心地为夺取今年农业更大丰收而战斗。　吴家杰　梁畅兴
