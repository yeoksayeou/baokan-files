According to Xinhua News Agency, Mogadishu, April 26th, the Somali Writers' Association issued a statement on April 26th, enthusiastically welcoming Mao Zedong's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence. The statement emphasized that Mao Zedong's statement, "fully expresses the stance of the great leader, great commander, and great helmsman Mao Zedong and the great Communist Party of China, and fully expresses the stance of the great Chinese people. This is the stance of true Marxists-Leninists on world revolution and the struggles of the world's people."

The statement said, "Mao Zedong's statement is not only a call to American blacks but also a call to the oppressed and exploited people of the United States and other countries in the world. Whenever the struggles of the oppressed and exploited people intensify, we hear Mao Zedong's voice supporting these struggles."

The statement said, "Mao Zedong's statement has received the broadest support from the people of the world, making the imperialists and their running dogs panic and disarrayed. The Somali people, who have a tradition of opposing imperialism, American imperialism, and racial discrimination, most enthusiastically welcome Mao Zedong's statement." It went on to say that Mao Zedong's statement shines like a brilliant sun, illuminating the bright future of the oppressed people.

The statement emphasized, "Mao Zedong has elevated Marxism-Leninism to a new stage. Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time."

The statement concluded with the slogans: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Chairman Mao's revolutionary theory!"

According to Xinhua News Agency, Khartoum, April 25th, the Chairman of the Sudan-China Friendship Association, Abdel Wahab Zein Abdelin, wrote a letter to Xinhua News Agency, enthusiastically praising Chairman Mao and the Chinese people for always supporting the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed people of Africa, Asia, Latin America, and North America.

The letter said, "In his statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence, Chairman Mao called on the workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and all those who want to oppose American imperialism around the world to take action and resolutely support the struggle of American blacks, and oppose American imperialism. We Sudanese people cheer this call. Support for the struggle of American blacks is also support for the Africans in Southern Rhodesia and South Africa who suffer from imperialist racial discrimination and oppression."

The letter said, "We sincerely pay tribute to the great leader Chairman Mao."

The Secretary-General of the Sudan-China Friendship Association, Mirghani Ali Mustafa, told Chinese friends in Khartoum that Chairman Mao's statement shows Chairman Mao's great concern for the people of the world. Mirghani shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Down with American imperialism!" "Down with Soviet revisionism!"

The Chairman of the Sudan-African Unity Organization, Bashir Muhammad Hel, said that Chairman Mao's statement points the way to liberation for American blacks.

The Sudanese friend Salah Rufai said that Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence is a Marxist-Leninist document. Rufai condemned the revisionist elements of the American Communist Party for advocating the "legal" and "peaceful" path as a means of "maintaining civil rights" and "eliminating" racial discrimination. He said, "This is a great betrayal of the oppressed blacks."

He said, "Chairman Mao's statement wisely analyzes the contradictions between American blacks and those who oppress them, and also points the way to victory for the blacks, becoming a spiritual atomic bomb for American blacks, workers, and progressive people."

    据新华社摩加迪沙二十六日电　索马里作家协会二十六日发表声明，热烈欢呼毛主席发表的支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明，并强调指出，毛主席的声明，
  “充分表达了以伟大导师、伟大统帅和伟大舵手毛主席为首的伟大的中国共产党的立场，充分表达了伟大的中国人民的立场。这是真正的马克思列宁主义者对世界革命和世界人民斗争的立场。”
    声明说：“毛主席的声明不仅是对美国黑人发出的号召，而且也是对美国和世界其他国家一切被压迫、被剥削人民发出的号召。每当被压迫、被剥削人民的斗争激化的时候，我们就听到毛主席支持这种斗争的声音。”
    声明说：“毛主席的声明得到了全世界人民最广泛的支持，使美帝国主义及其走狗乱成一团，狼狈不堪。具有反对殖民主义、美帝国主义和种族歧视传统的索马里人民，最热烈地欢呼毛主席的声明。”它接着说，毛主席的声明象灿烂的阳光照亮了被压迫人民的光辉前途。
    声明强调说：“毛主席把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。”
    声明最后高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席的革命学说万岁！”
    据新华社喀土穆二十五日电苏丹—中国友好协会主席阿卜杜勒·瓦哈卜·宰因·阿卜丁就毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明的发表，写信给新华社，热情赞扬毛主席和中国人民始终支持非洲、亚洲、拉丁美洲和北美洲的被压迫人民的革命斗争。
    这封信说，毛主席在支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明中号召全世界的工人、农民、革命知识分子和一切愿意反对美帝国主义的人们行动起来坚决支持美国黑人的斗争，反对美帝国主义。我们苏丹人欢呼这一号召。对美国黑人斗争的支持，也是对遭受帝国主义的种族歧视和压迫的南罗得西亚和南非非洲人的支持。
    信中说：“我们衷心地向伟大领袖毛主席致敬。”
    苏丹—中国友好协会秘书长米尔加尼·阿里·穆斯塔法在喀土穆对中国朋友说，毛主席的声明表明了毛主席对世界人民的巨大关怀。米尔加尼高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒苏修！”

    苏丹朋友萨拉赫·鲁法伊说，毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明，是一个马克思列宁主义的文献。鲁法伊谴责美共修正主义分子鼓吹走“合法的”、“和平的”道路，作为“维护民权”和“消灭”种族歧视的手段。他说，这是对被压迫的黑人的极大的出卖。
    他说，毛主席的声明英明地分析了美国黑人和压迫他们的人之间的矛盾，还向黑人指明了走向胜利的道路，成为美国黑人、工人和进步人士拥有的精神原子弹。
