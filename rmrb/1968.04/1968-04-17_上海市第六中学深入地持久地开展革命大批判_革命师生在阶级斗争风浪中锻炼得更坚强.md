Revolutionary teachers and students become stronger in the storms of class struggle

They have come to realize that only by firmly grasping revolutionary criticism and denunciation can they better follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment in the class struggle, firmly grasp the direction of the revolutionary struggle, and consolidate revolutionary great alliance and the three-in-one combination.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 16 - The revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Shanghai No. 6 Middle School (formerly No. 6 Girls' Middle School) have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, deeply and persistently carried out revolutionary criticism and denunciation, smashed the enemy's repeated frenzied counterattacks, and continuously implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions. This has made the newly born revolutionary committee and the broad revolutionary teachers and students stronger in the storms of class struggle.

In April last year, the school quickly achieved revolutionary great alliance from the bottom up by class through carrying out revolutionary criticism and denunciation. Subsequently, they achieved revolutionary "three-in-one combination" in the revolutionary criticism and denunciation and established a revolutionary committee. After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, they followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, led the broad revolutionary teachers and students to hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism and denunciation, and persistently carried out revolutionary criticism and denunciation. This has made the school appear more vigorous and lively politically than ever before. They have deeply felt from revolutionary struggle practice that revolutionary criticism and denunciation is class struggle and a powerful driving force for all work.

From April last year to now, the school has, in accordance with the situation, tasks, and the actual conditions of the unit, persistently carried out revolutionary criticism and denunciation. They have always directed the spearhead of struggle against China's Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and their agents. The broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff first criticized China's Khrushchev's black "Cultivation of the Self" and the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie he concocted, making the masses receive profound education in the criticism and denunciation. They denounced the poisonous effects of the black "Cultivation of the Self" and the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie on themselves. On this basis, they seriously studied Chairman Mao's policies on cadres and further severely criticized China's Khrushchev's reactionary line of the bourgeoisie in the issue of cadres, which was to "strike down a large number and protect a small number." This liberated the majority of revolutionary cadres in the school and enhanced the fighting strength of the newly born revolutionary committee in leading revolutionary teachers and students to attack class enemies.

In the process of resuming classes and carrying out the cultural revolution, revolutionary teachers and students repeatedly studied and understood Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on educational revolution. They concentrated their firepower to criticize and denounce China's Khrushchev's revisionist educational line. The revolutionary teachers and students of the entire school deeply understood the evil nature of the revisionist educational line and further understood the great significance of Chairman Mao's teaching that "it is necessary to thoroughly change the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools." Subsequently, they launched a mass movement to study Chairman Mao's brilliant theory of building the Party and severely criticize China's Khrushchev's revisionist line of building the Party. Through this revolutionary criticism and denunciation, the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of the entire school received a profound lesson on Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on building the Party. This greatly raised the revolutionary teachers and students' awareness of class struggle and line struggle. It also initially cleaned up the teaching staff and exposed the traitors, spies, and landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who had infiltrated the teaching staff, thus purifying the revolutionary ranks.

In the process of deeply and persistently carrying out revolutionary criticism and denunciation, the revolutionary committee of Shanghai No. 6 Middle School has been subjected to repeated frenzied attacks by class enemies. However, the revolutionary committee of this school always remembered Chairman Mao's teaching that "whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." They followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and organized the entire school's Red Guards and broad revolutionary teachers and students to carry out revolutionary criticism and denunciation. They used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to fight against class enemies and reactionary ideologies from the right or ultra-left, thus safeguarding Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The revolutionary teachers and students of Shanghai No. 6 Middle School have deeply felt in the practice of deeply and persistently carrying out revolutionary criticism and denunciation that only by firmly grasping revolutionary criticism and denunciation can they, in the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, always follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and firmly grasp the direction of the revolutionary struggle. They can also consolidate the revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination in terms of ideology and organization. After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, the focus of struggle is still the issue of power. Carrying out revolutionary criticism and denunciation is an important way to consolidate the proletarian revolutionary power and thoroughly smash the class enemies' conspiracy of capitalist restoration. They have also deeply felt that revolutionary criticism and denunciation is the best classroom for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in practice. Carrying out revolutionary criticism and denunciation is the process of thoroughly criticizing and denouncing bourgeois ideology and establishing Mao Zedong Thought. This can implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions in the struggle. The more revolutionary criticism and denunciation is carried out, the more hatred there will be towards China's Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and their agents, and the more love there will be for the great leader Chairman Mao. The more revolutionary criticism and denunciation is carried out, the stronger the proletarian feelings of studying Chairman Mao's works will be. Only in revolutionary criticism and denunciation and struggle can Mao Zedong Thought be deeply studied, actively applied, and firmly grasped, truly taking root in one's mind.

They are determined to continue to carry out revolutionary criticism and denunciation in accordance with the situation, tasks, and class struggle of the unit, and to carry the proletarian cultural revolution and proletarian educational revolution through to the end.

    上海市第六中学深入地持久地开展革命大批判
    革命师生在阶级斗争风浪中锻炼得更坚强
    他们体会到，只有紧紧抓住革命大批判，才能在阶级斗争中更好地紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握革命斗争大方向，巩固革命大联合和三结合
    据新华社上海十六日电　上海市第六中学（原第六女中）革命师生员工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，深入地持久地开展革命的大批判，粉碎了阶级敌人一次又一次的猖狂反扑，不断落实毛主席的最新指示，使新生的革命委员会和广大革命师生在阶级斗争的风浪中锻炼得更加坚强。
    去年四月间，这个学校通过开展革命的大批判，迅速实现了全校自下而上按班级的革命大联合。接着，他们又在革命的大批判中实现了革命的“三结合”，成立了革命委员会。校革委会成立以后，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，率领广大革命师生高举革命批判大旗，坚持开展革命的大批判，使学校出现了从未有过的朝气勃勃的政治局面。他们从革命的斗争实践中深深感到：革命的大批判就是阶级斗争，是推动一切工作的强大动力。
    从去年四月到现在，这个学校结合形势、任务和本单位的实际情况，一直坚持开展革命的大批判，始终把斗争矛头对准中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派及其代理人。广大革命师生员工首先批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的黑《修养》及其炮制的资产阶级反动路线，使群众在批判中接受深刻的教育，纷纷控诉黑《修养》和资产阶级反动路线对自己的毒害。在这个基础上，他们又认真学习了毛主席的干部政策，进一步狠狠批判了中国赫鲁晓夫在干部问题上推行的
  “打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，解放了学校的绝大多数革命干部，增强了新生的革命委员会率领革命师生向阶级敌人进攻的战斗力。
    在学校复课闹革命、深入开展教育革命的过程中，革命师生反复学习和领会毛主席光辉的教育革命思想，集中火力批判中国赫鲁晓夫推行的修正主义教育路线。全校革命师生深刻认识到修正主义教育路线的罪恶本质，进一步体会到毛主席教导的“必须彻底改变资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象”的重大意义。接着，他们掀起了大学毛主席光辉的建党学说，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线的群众运动。通过这场革命大批判，全校革命师生员工受到了一堂深刻的毛主席光辉建党思想的党课教育，大大提高了革命师生的阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟，并且初步清理了教工队伍，把混在教工队伍内的叛徒、特务以及地、富、反、坏、右分子揪了出来，纯洁了革命队伍。
    上海市第六中学革命委员会在深入地持久地开展革命大批判的过程中，受到了阶级敌人一次又一次的猖狂攻击。但是，这个学校的革命委员会始终牢记毛主席“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对”的教导，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚持组织全校红卫兵小将和广大革命师生员工开展革命的大批判，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想同阶级敌人以及右的或极“左”方面的反动思潮进行针锋相对的斗争，保卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    上海市第六中学的革命师生在深入地持久地开展革命大批判的实践中深刻体会到，只有紧紧抓住了革命的大批判，才能在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中，始终紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握革命斗争的大方向，才能从思想上、组织上巩固革命的大联合和革命三结合。在革命委员会建立以后，斗争的焦点仍然是政权问题。开展革命的大批判，是巩固无产阶级革命政权，彻底粉碎阶级敌人资本主义复辟阴谋的重要途径。他们还深刻地体会到，革命大批判是活学活用毛泽东思想的最好课堂。开展革命的大批判，就是大破资产阶级思想、大立毛泽东思想的过程，就能在斗争中落实毛主席的一系列最新指示。越搞革命的大批判，就越能对中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派及其代理人无比仇恨，对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱。越搞革命的大批判，学习毛主席著作的无产阶级感情就越强烈。只有在革命的大批判中，在斗争中，毛泽东思想才能学得深、用得活、掌握得牢，真正在头脑里扎根。
    他们决心坚持结合形势、任务和本单位的阶级斗争，继续不断地开展革命大批判，把无产阶级文化大革命和无产阶级教育革命进行到底。
