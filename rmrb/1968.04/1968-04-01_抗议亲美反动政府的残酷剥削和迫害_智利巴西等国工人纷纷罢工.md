Workers in several Latin American countries have recently gone on strike to protest the cruel exploitation by pro-American reactionary governments. Students have also taken to the streets in demonstrations against the persecution by reactionary authorities.

In Chile, over 20,000 municipal workers and 4,500 tax officials in the capital, Santiago, went on a 48-hour strike on the 26th to oppose the Chilean government's economic policy that plunders the broad masses of laboring people. On the same day, 3,200 metallurgical workers in the city of Vachipato went on strike to support the workers of the Chilean Electric Company, which is controlled by American capital, who had gone on strike on the 21st to protest the cruel exploitation by American bosses.

In the province of Concepcion, 3,500 unemployed workers began marching on foot to the capital, Santiago, on the 27th to demand their right to live. This group was suppressed by reactionary military police on their way to the capital, but they pressed on undeterred. A leader of the group said, "We want to live like human beings."

In Bolivia, under the pro-American dictatorship of Barrientos, a group of university students recently held a demonstration in the capital, La Paz, throwing stones and glass bottles at the Ministry of the Interior to protest the suppression of the Bolivian people by the pro-American government of Barrientos.

In Venezuela's second-largest city, Maracaibo, students held a demonstration on the 27th to support the sanitation workers who had been on strike for 12 days. The reactionary authorities sent in military police to suppress the student demonstration. Two students were killed and over 200 injured in the clash.

In Brazil, over 10,000 students in Rio de Janeiro held a demonstration on the 29th to strongly protest the bloody massacre by U.S. imperialism and the Brazilian reactionaries of a student on the 28th. The participating university students carried placards reading, "Yankee, you killed a Brazilian," and shouted slogans such as, "Down with U.S. imperialism!" and "Down with the dictatorship!" They smashed the windows of the U.S. Embassy as they passed by.
