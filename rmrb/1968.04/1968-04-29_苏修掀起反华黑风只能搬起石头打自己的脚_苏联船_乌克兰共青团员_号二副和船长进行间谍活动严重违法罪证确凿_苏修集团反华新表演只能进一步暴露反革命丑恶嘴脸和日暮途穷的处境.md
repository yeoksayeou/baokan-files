In the wake of the second-in-command and captain of the Soviet ship "Ukraine Komsomol" engaging in espionage and serious illegal activities in a Chinese port, and being expelled by Chinese authorities on April 4, the Soviet revisionist leadership, driven by their own ulterior motives, has whipped up a new wave of anti-China propaganda in recent days, staging a clumsy anti-China farce.

Just one day after the "Ukraine Komsomol" was forcibly escorted out of a Chinese port by Chinese authorities, the Soviet revisionists, who had already apologized to the Chinese side for the so-called "Chinese experts" group member Chen Jixian's incident at Tashkent Airport more than 20 days prior, suddenly revived this issue. They used this fabricated excuse to unjustly expel Chen Jixian. This further exposed the Soviet revisionists' desperation, anger, and ruthless revenge tactics.

After the "Ukraine Komsomol" returned to Vladivostok, the Soviet revisionists' anti-China farce immediately kicked into high gear. In this farce, the Soviet leadership refused to acknowledge the second-in-command Ponomarchuk's espionage activities and infringement on Chinese sovereignty, as well as the captain Kosyakov's serious illegal behavior. They mobilized all their propaganda machines, holding "public" meetings and press conferences, issuing "statements" and "appeals," attempting to cover up their crimes with lies and viciously attacking the Chinese authorities' completely justified actions to safeguard Chinese sovereignty. They went to great lengths to portray the criminals on the "Ukraine Komsomol" as heroes who had achieved "merits" and were "glorious" and "brave," claiming that these individuals displayed "great fortitude, tenacity, and courage." They maliciously slandered China's exercise of sovereignty and punishment of criminal behavior as "coercive and violent actions" and claimed that it "damaged" the "aid to Vietnam" cause. They shouted about taking measures and not being indifferent to the issue.

The Soviet revisionists' anti-China hysteria was loud and aggressive, but they dared not honestly explain to the Soviet people why the Chinese authorities had to forcibly escort the "Ukraine Komsomol" out of the port and expel its captain and second-in-command. It was not until April 19 that, unable to continue covering up the truth, Captain Kosyakov reluctantly admitted at a press conference in Moscow that the second-in-command Ponomarchuk had "taken a few photographs" in a Chinese port. However, he lied about the content of the photographs, claiming they were of "Chinese sailors welcoming Soviet sailors in Shanghai," attempting to shift the blame and deceive the Soviet people with this dishonest tactic.

The Soviet revisionist clique's trick is extremely clumsy. They shamelessly lie to the Soviet people but do not care about the evidence already in the hands of the Chinese people. In his confession to the Chinese Huangpu Border Defense authorities, Captain Kosyakov clearly admitted: "On March 23, the second-in-command Ponomarchuk took photographs of the People's Liberation Army Navy ships while sailing in the Humen waterway," and acknowledged that these photographs were secretly taken "from the chief officer's room." Kosyakov also expressed "sincere apologies" for these crimes and promised "never to repeat such actions under any circumstances." Kosyakov's confession is clear and indisputable. The camera used by Ponomarchuk for his criminal activities and the two rolls of film he attempted to destroy have been seized by Chinese authorities. Now, the Soviet revisionist traitors want to deny their guilt, but their lies only further prove their shamelessness.

In this anti-China uproar, the Soviet revisionists shouted the loudest about a fabricated story involving a Soviet ship cleaner. However, this lie was poorly constructed. They first claimed she was "three months pregnant" and had a "miscarriage," then said she had "nervous shock," and finally claimed she had "lost the chance to become the mother of twins." As the saying goes, "A lie cannot be sustained." Despite their efforts, the truth eventually surfaced. The fact is that during the entire period Chinese border inspection personnel were on the "Ukraine Komsomol," the cleaner named Shumova never appeared. How then could Chinese personnel have caused her "nervous shock" leading to a "miscarriage"? Clearly, the creators of this fabricated story intended to use this sensational lie to attract an audience and stir up anti-China sentiments among the Soviet people.

The Soviet revisionists also shouted about how China's handling of the second-in-command Ponomarchuk and Captain Kosyakov was aimed at "disrupting the aid to the Vietnamese people" and "causing harm to the Vietnamese people." This absurd anti-China propaganda to drive a wedge between the Chinese and Vietnamese peoples is even more ridiculous and laughable. How is the espionage activities of Soviet ships and personnel in Chinese ports related to "aiding Vietnam"? If there is any relation, it is only that the Soviet revisionists want to use this as an excuse to cover up their false aid. Moreover, at a time when U.S. imperialism, in close coordination with the Soviet revisionist leadership, is using the tactic of "bombing halt and deception" in Vietnam and actively preparing to escalate the war, the Soviet revisionists, like U.S. imperialism, are vigorously conducting espionage activities against the great rear base of the Vietnamese people's anti-American, national salvation struggle—the People's Republic of China. This is truly "causing harm to the Vietnamese people" and "aimed at disrupting the aid to the Vietnamese people"!

It must be pointed out that Soviet ships and personnel have long been conducting espionage activities in Chinese territorial waters. In July 1967 alone, the Soviet reconnaissance ships "Hydrographer" and "Hydrologist" entered the eastern coastal waters of China six times, blatantly infringing on the sovereignty of the People's Republic of China and threatening China's security. The "Ukraine Komsomol"'s espionage activities are yet another crime committed by the Soviet revisionists against the Chinese people.

The Brezhnev-Kosygin clique's staging of this unseemly farce is entirely driven by their counter-revolutionary political needs. This gang of traitors and scoundrels, in their full-scale restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union, has provoked increasingly strong dissatisfaction and resistance from the broad masses of Soviet working people; their foreign policy of serving U.S. imperialism faithfully has been condemned and opposed by the revolutionary peoples of the world; modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionists is further accelerating its disintegration, and their days are even harder. The Brezhnev-Kosygin clique's new anti-China outburst at this time is aimed at diverting the attention of the broad masses of people from their predicament and currying favor with U.S. imperialism. However, as our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "'Lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet,' this is a Chinese saying used to describe the behavior of some fools. The reactionaries of all countries are precisely such a bunch of fools." The Soviet revisionists' new anti-China performance can only further expose their anti-China, anti-communist, and anti-people ugly faces and their desperate situation to the Soviet people and revolutionary people of the world. No matter how they perform or struggle, they cannot change their shameful fate.

    苏修掀起反华黑风只能搬起石头打自己的脚
    苏联船“乌克兰共青团员”号二副和船长进行间谍活动严重违法罪证确凿
    苏修集团反华新表演只能进一步暴露反革命丑恶嘴脸和日暮途穷的处境
    新华社二十八日讯　本社记者报道：在苏联船“乌克兰共青团员”号二副和船长在中国港口进行间谍活动和严重违法，被我有关当局于四月四日驱逐出境后，苏修领导集团出于自己不可告人的目的，这些天来就这件事煽起了一股新的反华黑风，演出了一场非常拙劣的反华丑剧。
    就在“乌克兰共青团员”号被中国有关当局武装押送出境的第二天，苏修集团把他们在二十多天前已经向中国方面承认错误并赔礼道歉的所谓中国专家组成员陈继贤在塔什干机场“拍照”的问题，重新拾了起来，以这个莫须有的借口，无理地驱逐陈继贤。这就进一步暴露了苏修集团理屈词穷、老羞成怒、不择手段进行报复的丑态。
    在“乌克兰共青团员”号回到海参崴后，苏修集团这场反华小闹剧立即紧锣密鼓地正式开场。在这出闹剧中，苏修领导集团对“乌克兰共青团员”号二副波诺马尔楚克进行间谍活动、侵犯中国主权的罪恶行径和船长柯夏科夫的严重违法行为死不认账。他们开动一切宣传工具，同时，又是举行“群众”集会和记者招待会，又是发表“声明”和“呼吁书”，企图用种种谎言遮盖自己的罪行，并对中国有关当局维护中国主权的完全正当的行动猖狂地进行攻击。他们费尽心机，硬把“乌克兰共青团员”号上对中国犯罪的分子当作是建立了“功勋”的“光荣”和“英勇”的人物大吹大擂，令人作呕地说什么这些人表现了“巨大的坚毅、顽强和勇敢”的精神；而对中国行使主权、制裁犯罪行为的正当行动，则污蔑为“采取强制和粗暴暴力行动”和什么“损害”了“援越”事业；并叫嚷什么对此“不能漠不关心”，要“采取措施”等等。
    苏修这场反华歇斯底里，叫叫嚷嚷，费尽了气力。可是，他们就是不敢向苏联人民老老实实交代中国有关当局为什么要武装押送“乌克兰共青团员”号出港，并驱逐它的船长和二副出境这一实质问题。直到本月十九日，在实在无法继续掩饰的情况下，苏船船长柯夏科夫在莫斯科举行的记者招待会上，才被迫吞吞吐吐地承认苏船二副波诺马尔楚克在中国港口“拍摄了几张照片”，但他却胡说拍摄的是什么“中国海员欢迎苏联油船上海员的场面”，妄图用这种偷梁换柱的卑劣手法，推卸罪责，欺骗苏联人民。
    苏修叛徒集团的这一伎俩是十分拙劣的。他们厚着脸皮在苏联人民面前撒谎，却一点不顾已经落在中国人民手里的贼赃。苏船船长柯夏科夫在向中国黄埔边防当局写的认罪书中明白无误地承认：“今年三月二十三日，二副波诺马尔楚克，当航行在虎门地区航道的时候”，拍摄了“中华人民共和国军舰的照片”，而且承认这些照片是偷偷地“从大副的房间拍摄的”。柯夏科夫还对上述罪行“表示诚挚的歉意”，“坚决保证，今后在任何时候和任何情况下，不再重犯”。柯夏科夫的认罪书白纸黑字，铁证如山。波诺马尔楚克所使用的犯罪工具照相机和他两次企图曝光灭迹未成的底片，也已被中国有关当局没收。而今，苏修叛徒们却想赖账，抵赖偷拍中国舰艇和虎门要塞地形的地地道道的间谍行径，这样睁着眼睛说瞎话，不仅推卸不了自己的罪责，反倒进一步证明了他们的无耻。
    苏修叛徒集团在这场反华喧嚣中，叫嚷得最起劲的，是他们捏造的一个苏船女清洁工的所谓“遭遇”的奇闻。然而，这个谎言编造得实在太蹩脚。他们一会儿说她“怀孕三个月”“小产”了，一会儿说她“神经震荡”，一会儿又说什么“她失去了成为一对双胞胎的母亲的可能”，如此等等，不一而足。俗话说，“谎话编不圆”。尽管苏修集团精心炮制，仍不免露馅。事实真相是：在中国边防检查人员在“乌克兰共青团员”号上的整个期间，这位名叫舒莫娃的女清洁工从未露过面。既然如此，中国人员又怎么可能使她“神经震荡”以至于“小产”呢？很显然，奇闻炮制者的卑鄙用心是想以这个耸人听闻的捏造为这场冷落的反华丑剧招徕一些观众，增添一些廉价的效果，在苏联人民中间煽动反华情绪。
    苏修还叫嚷什么，中国有关方面对苏联船“乌克兰共青团员”号二副波诺马尔楚克和船长柯夏科夫的严正处理“目的是破坏援助越南人民的事业”、“给越南人民造成损害”等等。这种妄图离间中越人民之间的战斗友谊的反华谰言，就更其荒唐，更其可笑了。试问，苏联船只和船员在中国港口进行间谍活动，这同“援越”有什么关系呢？如果要说有什么关系的话，那就不过是苏修集团想制造借口来为自己的假援助蒙上一块遮羞布而已。而且，正当美帝国主义在苏修领导集团的紧密配合下，在越南施展“停炸诱和”手法，积极准备进一步扩大战争的时候，苏修集团同美帝国主义一样，极力对越南人民抗美救国斗争的大后方——中华人民共和国进行间谍活动，这才真正是“给越南人民造成损害”，“目的是破坏援助越南人民的事业”哩！
    应当严正指出，苏联船只和人员早就在中国领水进行间谍活动了。仅在一九六七年七月间，苏联侦察船“水文学家”号和“水道测量”号就连续六次进入我华东沿海地区，进行间谍活动，明目张胆地侵犯中华人民共和国的主权，威胁我国的安全。“乌克兰共青团员”号这次间谍活动，是苏修在这方面对中国人民犯下的又一个新罪行。
    勃列日涅夫—柯西金集团这一次借这个极不光采的事件演出了又一场反华闹剧，这完全是出于他们反革命的政治需要。这一伙叛徒工贼在苏联全面复辟资本主义，引起了广大苏联劳动人民越来越强烈的不满和抵制；他们在国际上奉行为美帝国主义忠实服务的外交路线，受到了世界各国革命人民的谴责和反对；以苏修为中心的现代修正主义正在进一步加速分崩离析，他们的日子更加不好过了。勃列日涅夫—柯西金集团在这个时候掀起反华新叫嚣，其目的就是为了转移广大人民对他们这种困境的注意力，向美帝国主义献媚。然而，正如我们伟大的领袖毛主席指出：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。”苏修集团这次反华新表演，只能在苏联人民和全世界革命人民面前进一步暴露他们反华、反共、反人民的丑恶面目和日暮途穷的处境。他们无论如何表演，如何挣扎，都无法改变他们的可耻下场。
