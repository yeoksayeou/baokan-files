Recently, the Soviet revisionist ruling clique has been making a fuss about China's expulsion of the captain and second officer of the Soviet ship "Ukrainian Komsomol" and the armed escorting of the ship out of the port. They have stirred up a new wave of anti-China hysteria. From Vladivostok to Moscow, they have been holding "mass" meetings, conducting press conferences, issuing statements and appeals, and using newspapers, television, and radio to spread propaganda, creating a lot of noise.

The farce staged by the Soviet revisionist clique is extremely clumsy.

The Soviet revisionist clique pretends to be wronged, as if nothing happened with the second officer of the "Ukrainian Komsomol" taking photographs of our ships and the Tiger Gate Fortress in our port, conducting espionage activities, and the captain openly defying our laws and ordering the crew to provoke us. However, the evidence is clear, and your captain has confessed and written a confession. How can you deny it? Your people violated the law in our territory, and we must take necessary measures to maintain our sovereignty and the dignity of our laws. Let me tell you: if you dare to conduct espionage activities in our country, we will definitely punish you severely.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has said: "Representatives of various exploiting classes, when they are in an unfavorable situation, often adopt a strategy of 'attacking to defend themselves.' Or they fabricate lies out of nothing..." The Soviet revisionist clique is doing exactly this. Your people conducted espionage activities in our port and were caught red-handed, so you shamelessly distort the truth and try to turn the tables. This only shows that you are complete scoundrels.

The Soviet revisionist traitors try to portray themselves as "heroes" in assisting the Vietnamese people in their struggle against American imperialism, attacking the Chinese people for "disrupting" "aid to Vietnam." However, the real disruptors of aid to Vietnam are you traitors! Under the pretext of "aiding Vietnam," you engage in espionage activities and collude with the American imperialists to disrupt the rear base of the anti-American struggle in Vietnam. You pretend to aid the Vietnamese people but actually betray them. What face do you have to talk about "aiding Vietnam"? Now, you are making a big fuss about the expulsion of the Soviet ship's personnel for conducting espionage activities in a Chinese port, just to create an excuse to cover up your false aid and deceive people at home and abroad.

The Soviet revisionist traitors have always conducted espionage activities in our country. When their hands are caught, they deny it in every way, and even become enraged and resort to all kinds of revenge. This time, the Soviet revisionist traitors are doing the same thing. You are bringing up again the issue of accusing our expert group member Chen Jixian of "taking photographs," which you have already apologized for, fabricating reasons out of nothing, and arbitrarily expelling Chen Jixian. This shows how degenerate you traitors have become!

The Soviet revisionist clique is staging this anti-China farce not only to cover up their crimes in Chinese ports but also out of their domestic and foreign policy needs. This small clique of traitors is facing increasing instability in their domestic rule, and at the same time, the contradictions within modern revisionism centered around the Soviet revisionist clique are numerous and disintegrating. The Soviet revisionist clique, facing internal and external difficulties, wants to use anti-China sentiment to divert the attention of the people, please American imperialism, and strengthen their control over their lackeys. However, the Soviet revisionist clique's rampant anti-China activities will not save themselves; on the contrary, they will only further expose their counter-revolutionary nature and hasten their own doom.

    拙劣的反华表演
    本报评论员
    最近，苏修统治集团就我驱逐苏联船“乌克兰共青团员”号船长和二副并武装押送该船出港一事，大吵大闹，掀起了一阵新的反华妖风。从海参崴到莫斯科，他们又是召开“群众”集会，又是举行记者招待会，左一个“声明”，右一个“呼吁书”，同时开动了报刊、电视、广播等宣传机器，鼓噪不休。
    苏修集团上演的这一出装疯卖傻的丑剧，是十分拙劣的。
    苏修集团煞有介事地鸣冤叫屈，好象就根本没有发生过“乌克兰共青团员”号的二副在我国港口偷摄我舰艇和虎门要塞的照片、进行间谍活动的事情，也没有发生过该船船长公然违抗我国法令、并且指挥船员对我进行挑衅的事情。但是，证据俱在，你们的船长供认不讳，并写下了认罪书。这怎么能赖得掉呢？你们的人在我国领土违法乱纪，我们当然要采取维护我国主权和法律尊严的必要措施。老实告诉你们：你们胆敢在我国进行间谍活动，我们就一定要严惩不贷。
  我们的伟大导师毛主席说过：各种剥削阶级的代表人物，当着他们处在不利情况的时候，“往往采取以攻为守的策略。或者无中生有，当面造谣……”。苏修集团就是这样干的。你们的人在我国港口搞间谍活动，被我当场拿获，于是你们就无耻地颠倒是非，想要倒打一耙。这只能表明你们是十足的无赖。
    苏修叛徒极力把自己打扮成为援助越南人民抗美救国斗争的“英雄”，大肆攻击中国人民“破坏”“援越”。可是，真正破坏援越的，正是你们这伙叛徒！你们借“援越”之名，行间谍活动之实，同美帝勾结起来破坏援越抗美的大后方。你们对越南人民是假援助，真出卖。你们还有什么脸皮谈“援越”？现在，你们就苏联船负责人在中国港口进行间谍活动而被驱逐这件事，大作反华文章，不过是想制造借口，为你们的假援助蒙上一层遮羞布，欺骗国内外人民罢了。
    苏修叛徒集团一贯在我国搞间谍活动。当黑手被揪住了，就百般抵赖，甚而老羞成怒，不择手段地进行报复。苏修叛徒这一次也是搞的这一套。你们硬把你们自己早已认错道歉过的诬指我国专家组成员陈继贤“拍照”的问题，重新端出来，无中生有地捏造“理由”，蛮横地驱逐陈继贤。这说明你们这些叛徒已堕落到何等地步！
    苏修集团所以要上演这场反华丑剧，不仅为了掩盖他们在中国港口犯下的罪行，也是出于他们内政外交的需要。这一小撮叛徒在国内的统治地位日益动摇，同时，以苏修集团为中心的现代修正主义矛盾重重，分崩离析。处于内外交困的苏修集团，要利用反华来转移人民的视线，讨好美帝国主义，并加强对娄罗们的控制。但是，苏修集团大肆反华并不能挽救他们自己，恰恰相反，只能进一步暴露他们的反革命面目，促使他们的末日更早地来临。
