The warmest support

Great Leader Chairman Mao's declaration represents the voice of the entire Chinese people, with every word shining like gold and every sentence full of strength. This declaration points the way for the liberation of all oppressed nations and peoples in the world. This declaration is a clarion call to arms. It calls on all oppressed nations and peoples in the world to raise the banner of revolution and launch a fierce attack on U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. This declaration is a mobilization order, mobilizing all the people of China and the world to resolutely support the American black people's struggle against violence, and to thoroughly bury imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries!

In the declaration, Great Leader Chairman Mao points out: "I represent the Chinese people in expressing resolute support for the just struggle of the American black people." We are loyal soldiers of Chairman Mao. Where Chairman Mao supports, we support; where Chairman Mao instructs, we act. We are revolutionary soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, with our hearts for our motherland and our eyes on the world. We never forget the people who have not yet gained liberation in the world, and we vow to be the strong backbone of the American black people's struggle against violence.

Vow to be the backbone of American black people

U.S. imperialism is not only the sworn enemy of the American people but also the common enemy of the Chinese people and all peoples of the world.

Great Teacher Chairman Mao clearly points out in the declaration: "The struggle of American black people for liberation is an integral part of the global struggle against U.S. imperialism." The seven hundred million Chinese people, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have always regarded supporting the world proletarian revolution as a sacred internationalist duty. We vow to be the strong backbone of the American black people and the American people. We will raise the banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought's internationalism, unite closely with all peoples of the world, resolutely support the American black people's struggle against violence, and fight to the end to thoroughly bury U.S. imperialism and all its running dogs, achieving the complete liberation of all oppressed nations and peoples in the world.

We vow to be promoters of the world revolution

With immense excitement, we warmly hail the publication of Chairman Mao's great declaration and resolutely support the American black people's struggle against violence!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "People who have already won the revolution should aid the struggle of those still striving for liberation. This is our internationalist duty." We, the proletarian revolutionaries, are promoters of the world revolution. We resolutely respond to the battle call of Great Leader Chairman Mao, resolutely support the American black people's struggle against violence. We will surely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, carry out this proletarian political revolution against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes to the end, and build our great socialist motherland into an even more consolidated and powerful base for the world revolution. This is our most powerful support for the American black people's struggle against violence and for the revolutionary struggles of all peoples of the world.

Long live revolutionary violence!

In the declaration, Great Leader Chairman Mao wisely points out: "The contradiction between the broad masses of American black people and the American ruling class is a class contradiction. Only by overthrowing the reactionary rule of the American monopolistic bourgeoisie and destroying the colonialist, imperialist system can American black people achieve complete liberation." Chairman Mao's wise judgment points out the fundamental path for American black people to struggle for liberation. American black people can only pick up their guns, use revolutionary violence against counter-revolutionary violence, and thoroughly destroy the colonialist, imperialist reactionary rule to achieve complete liberation. The bloody fact that the non-violent advocate Martin Luther King was killed by counter-revolutionary violence has once again educated American black people and the American people, as well as all oppressed and exploited nations and peoples in the world: U.S. imperialism will not lay down its butcher's knife. Only by taking up arms to engage in a head-on struggle with it can one achieve true liberation.

Bury the U.S. imperialists and all harmful pests

Currently, the revolutionary situation in the world is excellent and getting better. The days of U.S. imperialism and all reactionaries are numbered. The complete liberation of all oppressed nations and peoples in the world is not far off. However, as our great teacher Chairman Mao teaches: "Imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not willingly accept their defeat; they will make their last struggles." Now, U.S. imperialism is intensifying its plans to expand the war of aggression in Vietnam and brutally suppressing the black people's struggle against violence at home, which are manifestations of its dying struggles. We must definitely raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, more powerfully support the American black people's struggle against violence, support the revolutionary struggles of all peoples of the world, unite closely with all revolutionary peoples of the world, use revolutionary violence to destroy counter-revolutionary violence, and bury U.S. imperialism and all harmful pests!

Absolutely no illusions about U.S. imperialism

Just as the American black people's struggle against violence sweeps across the United States, our great leader Chairman Mao issued the "Declaration in Support of the American Black People's Struggle Against Violence." This declaration wisely points out the correct path for American black people and all oppressed nations and peoples to struggle for liberation. This declaration is a great battle call to all revolutionary peoples of China and the world. This declaration will greatly inspire the struggle for liberation of American black people and all revolutionary peoples of the world.

Our great leader Chairman Mao says: "The just struggle of American black people is bound to be victorious. The evil system of colonialism and imperialism, which rose with the enslavement and trafficking of black people, will also come to an end with the complete liberation of the black race." The courageous struggle against violence by awakened American black people powerfully proves Chairman Mao's wise judgment and clearly tells all oppressed nations and peoples in various countries that they must not pin their hopes for liberation on the "wisdom" of U.S. imperialism and reactionaries in various countries, nor harbor any illusions about non-violence. Only by using revolutionary violence against counter-revolutionary violence is the correct path to achieve the complete liberation of mankind.

    热烈响应毛主席的伟大号召  坚决支持美国黑人抗暴斗争
    最热烈的支持
    伟大领袖毛主席的声明，代表了我们全国人民的心声，字字闪金光，句句是力量。这个声明，为世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民的解放指出了方向。这个声明，是嘹亮的进军号。它号召全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民，高举革命大旗，向美帝国主义及其走狗冲锋陷阵，猛烈进攻。这个声明，是动员令，动员全中国人民和全世界人民，最坚决地支持美国黑人的抗暴斗争，把帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派彻底埋葬！
    伟大领袖毛主席在声明中指出：“我代表中国人民，对美国黑人的正义斗争，表示坚决的支持。”我们是毛主席的忠诚战士，毛主席支持我支持，毛主席指示我照办。我们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，胸怀祖国，放眼世界，我们时刻不忘世界上尚未获得解放的人民，我们誓做美国黑人抗暴斗争的坚强后盾。

    誓做美国黑人的后盾
    美帝国主义不仅是美国人民不共戴天的死敌，也是中国人民和全世界人民的共同敌人。
    伟大的导师毛主席在声明中明确指出：“美国黑人争取解放的斗争，是全世界人民反对美帝国主义的总斗争的一个组成部分”。用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，历来把支援世界无产阶级革命当作神圣的国际主义义务。我们誓做美国黑人和美国人民的坚强后盾。我们要高举马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的国际主义旗帜，和全世界人民紧密团结，坚决支持美国黑人的抗暴斗争，为彻底埋葬美帝国主义及其一切走狗，取得世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民的彻底解放而战斗到底。

    我们誓当世界革命促进派
    我们以无比激动的心情，最热烈地欢呼毛主席这一伟大声明的发表，最坚决地支持美国黑人的抗暴斗争！
    毛主席教导我们说：“已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争，这是我们的国际主义的义务。”我们无产阶级革命派，就是世界革命促进派。我们坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席的战斗号令，坚决支持美国黑人的抗暴斗争。我们一定紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，把这一场无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命进行到底，把我们伟大的社会主义祖国建设成为更加巩固、更加强大的世界革命的根据地。这就是我们对美国黑人抗暴斗争、对世界人民的革命斗争的最有力的支持。

    革命的暴力万岁！
    伟大领袖毛主席在声明中英明地指出：“美国广大黑人同美国统治集团之间的矛盾，是阶级矛盾。只有推翻美国垄断资产阶级的反动统治，摧毁殖民主义、帝国主义制度，美国黑人才能够取得彻底解放。”毛主席的这一英明论断，给美国黑人指出了争取解放的根本道路。美国黑人只有拿起枪杆子，用革命的暴力反对反革命的暴力，彻底摧毁殖民主义、帝国主义的反动统治，才能获得彻底的解放。非暴力主义者马丁·路德·金死于反革命暴力屠刀之下的血的事实，再一次教育了美国黑人和美国人民，也教育了世界上一切被压迫、被剥削的民族和人民：美帝国主义是不会放下屠刀的，只有拿起武器来同它进行针锋相对的斗争，才能取得真正的解放。

    把美帝和一切害人虫统统埋葬
    当前，全世界革命形势一片大好，越来越好。美帝国主义和一切反动派的日子不会长久了，世界上一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民的彻底翻身，已经为期不远了。但是，正如我们的伟大导师毛主席所教导的：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”现在，美帝国主义正在越南加紧策划扩大侵略战争，在国内对黑人抗暴斗争进行穷凶极恶的野蛮镇压，就是它垂死挣扎的表现。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，更有力地支援美国黑人的抗暴斗争，支援全世界人民的革命斗争，和全世界革命人民紧密地团结在一起，用革命的暴力摧毁反革命的暴力，把美帝国主义和一切害人虫统统埋葬掉！

    绝不能对美帝抱任何幻想
    正当美国黑人的抗暴斗争席卷美国的时候，我们的伟大领袖毛主席发表了《支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明》。这个声明英明地指出了美国黑人和一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民争取解放的正确道路。这个声明是对全中国和全世界革命人民发出的伟大的战斗号召。这个声明必将极大地鼓舞美国黑人和全世界革命人民争取解放的斗争。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“美国黑人的正义斗争是一定要胜利的。万恶的殖民主义、帝国主义制度是随着奴役和贩卖黑人而兴盛起来的，它也必将随着黑色人种的彻底解放而告终。”觉醒了的美国黑人进行的英勇抗暴斗争，正雄辩地证明毛主席这一英明论断，并且清楚地告诉各国被压迫民族和被压迫人民，绝不能把自己的解放寄托在美帝国主义和各国反动派的“明智”上面，不能对非暴力抱任何幻想，只有以革命的暴力反对反革命的暴力，才是争取人类彻底解放的正确道路。　　       解放军第二六一医院
