The dictatorship of the proletariat is not the end of class struggle but the continuation of class struggle in a new form. The dictatorship of the proletariat is the class struggle waged by the victorious proletariat, which has seized political power, against the bourgeoisie, which, though defeated, has not yet been eliminated, has not disappeared, has not ceased to resist, and is instead intensifying its resistance.

    无产阶级专政不是阶级斗争的结束，而是阶级斗争在新形式中的继续。无产阶级专政是取得胜利、夺得政权的无产阶级进行阶级斗争，来反对已被打败但还没有被消灭、没有绝迹、没有停止反抗、反而加紧反抗的资产阶级。
