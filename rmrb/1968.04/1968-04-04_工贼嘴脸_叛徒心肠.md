The traitorous scab Liu Shaoqi often boasts that he is a "hardworking" "labor leader." He hangs this sign around his neck, swindling his way around, amassing political capital for the restoration of capitalism. The reactionary film "Sparking the Prairie Fire" was made according to his master's orders, racking his brains to depict Liu Shaoqi as the "embodiment of the Party," the "sunlight" illuminating the land.

Is Liu Shaoqi really a "labor leader"? History gives a completely opposite answer: he has never been a "labor leader," but a thorough and complete number one traitorous scab!

He slanders the Anshan strike as a "desperate" and "risky" adventure. One "riding the tiger," one "taking risks," he wipes out the great victory of the Anshan strike led by Chairman Mao.

Is there a "labor leader" who maliciously slanders the strike movement? No! Liu Shaoqi's howls only vividly portray his counter-revolutionary ugly face!

Due to the wise decision of the great leader Chairman Mao, the Anshan strike broke through all obstacles and was launched with great momentum. At this time, Liu Shaoqi stood on the side of the capitalists, putting on a "savior" face, scolding the workers: "Return to your homes," "Do not disturb," "The actions of each comrade should be more civilized than usual." In his view, workers rising up to resist the capitalists is extremely "uncivilized," only he, bowing and scraping to the capitalists, willingly becoming a slave, is the most "civilized." Liu Shaoqi's so-called "civilization" is that capitalists can kill people, but workers cannot resist. In a word, exploitation is justified, revolution is a crime. What kind of "civilization" is this? This is merely Liu Shaoqi's cover for betraying the revolution and maintaining the reactionary rule.

Is there a "labor leader" who advocates that exploitation is justified and rebellion is a crime? Liu Shaoqi is a genuine defender of the exploiting class.

The workers of the Anshan mines, with their spirits soaring, launched a great strike, which frightened the capitalists and forced them to negotiate. Before the negotiations, Liu Shaoqi repeatedly declared to the workers: "I am going to mediate." What a "mediator"! In the life-and-death struggle between the working class and the bourgeoisie, this "labor leader" Liu Shaoqi did not lead the workers in an unyielding struggle against the capitalists, but appeared as a "mediator," sitting on the same bench with the capitalists, committing the traitorous act of selling out the interests of the working class. The result of the "mediation" was: "In the future, workers shall not gather and disturb or threaten, and shall not strike and disrupt work." No strikes, no revolution, this is the "virtue" of Liu Shaoqi, the "mediator," in the negotiations. But the film dresses him up as a "hero with courage," distorting history, nothing more!

Is there a "labor leader" who acts as a "mediator" between the working class and the bourgeoisie? This nakedly exposes Liu Shaoqi's traitorous heart!

The victory of the Anshan strike is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought, the victory of the great struggle of the working class, but the great traitor Liu Shaoqi attributes this victory to the warlords and capitalists. He fawns over the reactionary warlords for their "active maintenance" of the strike, saying they "contributed a lot," and wants to "thank them deeply." For the fascist atrocities of the reactionary warlords in suppressing the great strike, instead of exposing and condemning them, he is grateful and praises them, completely reversing black and white, speaking from the standpoint of the reactionary bourgeoisie.

Is there a "labor leader" who praises and wants to "thank deeply" the reactionaries? Liu Shaoqi is shameless to the extreme!

In the Anshan strike struggle, Liu Shaoqi vigorously advocated economic struggle, slandering the working class as "immature," opposing the seizure of power. He rambled on about: "Economic issues, workers must fight for, the development of economic struggle is the development of the Chinese labor movement." According to this revisionist preaching, the reactionary film "Sparking the Prairie Fire" distorts the great struggle of the Anshan strike into a mere economic struggle of not letting the "rice bowl float away," insidiously attempting to strangle the political struggle of the proletariat with the soft knife of economism.

Is there a "labor leader" who opposes political struggle and advocates economic struggle? No! This fully proves that Liu Shaoqi is the biggest opportunist.

History always mocks those who try to block the advance of the revolution. No matter how much Liu Shaoqi boasts about himself, or how much the film tries hard to beautify him, the iron-clad facts have completely stripped off his "labor leader" mask, revealing his true face as a traitorous scab.

    工贼嘴脸　叛徒心肠
    北京邮票厂工人　戈中博
    中国赫鲁晓夫经常吹嘘他是“埋头苦干”的“工运领袖”。他挂着这块招牌，到处招摇撞骗，为复辟资本主义大捞政治资本。反动影片《燎原》的炮制者秉承其主子的意旨，挖空心思把中国赫鲁晓夫描写成“党的化身”，普照大地的“阳光”。
    中国赫鲁晓夫果真是“工运领袖”吗？历史作了截然相反的回答：他从来就不是什么“工运领袖”，而是一个彻头彻尾的头号大工贼、大叛徒！
    他污蔑安源罢工运动是处于“骑虎之势”的“挺而走险”的冒险行动。一个“骑虎”，一个“走险”，把毛主席亲自领导的安源路矿罢工斗争的伟大胜利抹得干干净净。
    难道有恶毒污蔑罢工运动的“工运领袖”吗？不！中国赫鲁晓夫的嚎叫，只是活生生地画出了他反革命的丑恶嘴脸！
    由于伟大领袖毛主席的英明决策，安源罢工冲破一切阻力轰轰烈烈开展起来了。这时，中国赫鲁晓夫站在资本家的立场上，板起一副“救世主”的面孔，训斥工人道：“各归住房”、“不得扰乱”，“各工友的举动，当比平时更加文明”。在他看来，工人起来向资本家反抗斗争，是极不“文明”的，只有象他那样对资本家俯首帖耳，甘当奴才，才是最“文明”的。中国赫鲁晓夫的所谓“文明”，就是只许资本家杀人，不许工人反抗。一句话，就是剥削有理，革命有罪。这哪里是什么“文明”，这不过是中国赫鲁晓夫出卖革命、维护反动统治的遮羞布。
    难道有宣扬剥削有理，造反有罪的“工运领袖”吗？中国赫鲁晓夫是地地道道的剥削阶级的卫道士。
    安源路矿工人们气壮山河的大罢工运动，吓得资本家双腿发抖，被迫进行谈判。在谈判之前，中国赫鲁晓夫再三向工人表白：“我是去调解的。”好一个“调解”！在工人阶级与资产阶级的殊死搏斗中，中国赫鲁晓夫这个
  “工运领袖”不是领导工人向资本家进行义无返顾的斗争，而却以“调解员”的身份出现，与资本家同坐一条板凳，大干出卖工人阶级利益的叛徒勾当。“调解”的结果是：“以后工人如有事项，不得动辄聚众喧扰要挟，并不得动辄罢工妨碍工作”。不许罢工，不许革命，这就是中国赫鲁晓夫这个“调解员”在谈判中的“德政”。而影片却把他打扮成“一身是胆”的“英雄”，篡改历史，莫此为甚！
    难道有在工人阶级与资产阶级之间当“调解员”的
  “工运领袖”吗？这赤裸裸地暴露了中国赫鲁晓夫的叛徒心肠！
    安源大罢工的胜利是毛泽东思想的胜利，是工人阶级伟大斗争的胜利，而大叛徒中国赫鲁晓夫却把这次胜利归功于军阀和资本家。他肉麻地吹捧反动军阀“对罢工积极维持”，“出力甚多”，并要“深深地谢谢他们”。对反动军阀血腥镇压大罢工的法西斯暴行，不是揭露鞭挞，而是感激涕零，百般美化，这完全是颠倒黑白，站在反动的资产阶级立场上说话。
    难道有百般吹捧并要“深深地谢谢”反动派的“工运领袖”吗？中国赫鲁晓夫真是无耻到了极点！
    在安源罢工斗争中，中国赫鲁晓夫竭力鼓吹经济斗争，污蔑工人阶级“幼稚”，反对夺取政权。他胡说什么：“经济问题，工人在所必争，经济斗争之发展，即为中国职工运动之发展。”根据这种修正主义的说教，反动影片《燎原》把安源大罢工这一伟大斗争，歪曲成只是不使“饭瓢子过河”的单纯经济斗争，阴险地企图用经济主义这把软刀子扼杀无产阶级的政治斗争。
    难道有反对政治斗争，鼓吹经济斗争的“工运领袖”吗？不！这充分证明中国赫鲁晓夫是最大的机会主义者。
    历史总是无情地嘲弄妄想阻挡革命前进的跳梁小丑。不管中国赫鲁晓夫怎样自吹自擂，也不管影片怎样煞费苦心地美化他，铁铸一般的事实却彻底剥掉了他“工运领袖”的画皮，还了他大工贼的本来面目。
