The sun rises in the east, and the spring breeze sweeps across the Japanese archipelago, stirring up waves of anti-American struggle. The revolutionary people's hearts turn towards the red sun in the hearts of the world's people, Chairman Mao, and they sing with joy: "Sailing the seas relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." The happiest moment.

Not long ago, at an exhibition of Chinese pictures in Ichinomiya City, Aichi Prefecture, a worker-turned-activist, Den Kouchikatarou, could not contain his excitement as he told a Chinese reporter about the most memorable event of his life: on October 23 last year, in the world revolutionary center of Beijing, he was fortunate enough to be received by the great leader Chairman Mao. Since then, although several months have passed, after seeing the Chinese picture exhibition, Den Kouchikatarou felt as if he were back by Chairman Mao's side. The moving scenes of being with Chairman Mao flashed before his eyes. With tears streaming down his face, he said passionately: "I saw Chairman Mao in excellent health, and I am extremely happy. Chairman Mao's health is the greatest happiness and encouragement for the revolutionary people of Japan and the world. I wish Chairman Mao a long life!" Den said, "Chairman Mao is the great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman of the revolutionary people of the world."

Den said, Mao Zedong Thought is the common wealth of the revolutionary people of the world. Once it is grasped by the masses, it will produce boundless power. Chairman Mao has shown the Japanese people the direction forward and the brilliant path of "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."

Den has always studied Chairman Mao's works in practice, striving to arm his mind with Mao Zedong Thought. At the end of the previous year, during the Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition in Nagoya, one day, right-wing hooligans, instigated and supported by the Japanese police authorities, caused trouble and provoked a disturbance at the exhibition site. Den, together with other Japanese friends, bravely fought against the right-wing hooligans to protect the exhibition and the cause of Sino-Japanese friendship. He was seriously injured in the waist. However, while receiving treatment in the hospital, he insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works and seriously read "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" on his sickbed.

Now, Den always carries the red treasure book "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with him. When he encounters problems, he consults Chairman Mao. He said, "I will spend my life listening to Chairman Mao's words and fighting for the liberation of the Japanese people."

The boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful ideological weapon to defeat imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries. With Mao Zedong Thought, there is a clear direction for struggle, and there will be boundless wisdom, limitless courage, and unshakable confidence. A truck driver from the Osaka area last November, under the inspiration of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely rebelled against the running dogs of American imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries, the revisionist Japan Communist Party led by Miyamoto. He saw from the series of criminal activities of the Miyamoto revisionist group that they were taking a path of betraying the revolution through the "parliamentary road." The mouthpiece of the Japan Communist Party revisionists, the "Red Flag" newspaper, published numerous articles against Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, showing that it is in cahoots with American imperialism and the Japanese reactionary government. The driver emphasized, "Only by arming Japanese workers with Mao Zedong Thought can the Japanese revolution be victorious."

Since this driver rebelled against the Miyamoto group, the Japan Communist Party revisionists have harbored deep grudges against him, inciting some people who do not understand the truth to try to drive him out of his union position. However, this driver, following Chairman Mao's teachings on believing in the masses and relying on the masses, went deep into the masses and, together with the masses, carried out a struggle against the revisionists, causing their plots to fail.

This Japanese worker enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao. He said, "Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great leader of the Japanese people." This driver has been reading Chairman Mao's brilliant philosophical works "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" since more than a decade ago and has systematically read "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." Now, he analyzes the actual situation in Japan and strives to learn the "Three Articles." He said that in Japan, the ruling class uses various despicable means to corrupt the working class, so we must constantly learn the "Three Articles" and continuously struggle against our selfishness to better dedicate ourselves to the Japanese revolution.

This driver emphasized, "We are now in a great era where imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards world victory. For this reason, we should study Mao Zedong Thought even more diligently and regard each of Chairman Mao's works as a motto to learn."

A female university student in Kyoto who loves Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, through studying Chairman Mao's works, gradually realized that intellectuals must go among the workers and peasants, participate in physical labor, and reform their worldview and emotions.

She told a Chinese reporter that after studying Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," she received a very profound education. This female university student, together with other young friends, fought against various sabotage and obstruction activities from the imperialist, revisionist, and reactionary camps and actively carried out the Sino-Japanese friendship movement. She used her rest time to enthusiastically write slogans, distribute leaflets, study, and propagate with everyone. In her practical struggle, she deeply felt that her past studies were detached from reality and realized that theory must be combined with practice.

To encourage herself and help her comrades, she hung a sentence from Vice Chairman Lin Biao's preface to the reprint of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" on the wall of the office of the Normal Japan-China Friendship Association in Kyoto: "Studying Chairman Mao's works, one should study with problems in mind, apply what one has learned actively, combine learning with application, learn what is urgently needed first, and see immediate results. One should work hard on the 'use' aspect." She said, "I think the method of studying Chairman Mao's works proposed by Vice Chairman Lin Biao is the best in the world, and I will study Chairman Mao's works well."

Some vigorous revolutionary youth in Kyoto, inspired by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, recently formed a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team. Members of this team include workers, youth, students, and activists dedicated to the Sino-Japanese friendship movement.

A female team member with a shining gold Mao badge on her chest said, "We not only need to actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought but also actively propagate Mao Zedong Thought. Now, American imperialism and the Japanese reactionary government of Sato are colluding to oppress the Japanese people. The Miyamoto group has degenerated into counter-revolutionaries. The struggle of the Japanese people against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries is surging higher and higher. The fighting Japanese people are thirsty for Mao Zedong Thought."

This newly formed Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, though small in number, has a sky-high revolutionary spirit and vigorous revolutionary enthusiasm. They use their spare time to insist on rehearsing once a week. Before rehearsals, they read Chairman Mao's quotations together. They also arrange time to study the "Three Articles" and "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," striving to establish proletarian literary and artistic thought and criticize bourgeois literary and artistic thought.

To support the surging anti-American patriotic struggle of the Japanese people, this Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team has turned the moving scene of Japanese revolutionary masses fighting bravely against Japanese armed police at Haneda Airport on October 8 last year to oppose Sato's plot to go to Taiwan into a street drama performance, which was warmly welcomed by the masses. Recently, they have practiced many songs written with Chairman Mao's quotations and songs praising Chairman Mao and are actively rehearsing the short play "In the Service of the People" that they collectively created.

    干革命靠毛泽东思想
    日本革命人民歌颂世界人民心中的红太阳毛主席
    旭日东升，春风激荡，日本列岛到处卷起反美斗争的怒涛，革命人民心向全世界人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，纵情高歌大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。最最幸福的时刻
    不久以前，在爱知县一宫市举办的中国图片展览会上，一位工人出身的活动家田幸嘉太郎抑制不住内心的激动，向中国记者讲述了他毕生难忘的特大喜事：去年十月二十三日，在世界革命中心北京，幸福地受到伟大领袖毛主席的接见。从那时起，虽然几个月过去了，但是田幸在看了中国图片展览会后，仿佛又回到了毛主席身边。同毛主席在一起时的一幕幕动人的场面，又浮现在他的眼前。他热泪夺眶，满怀激情地说：“我看到毛主席他老人家非常健康，真是高兴极了。毛主席身体健康是日本革命人民和世界革命人民的最大幸福，最大鼓舞。我敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！”田幸说：“毛主席是全世界革命人民的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手。”
    田幸说，毛泽东思想是世界革命人民的共同财富，她一旦被人民群众所掌握，就将产生无穷的力量。毛主席给我们日本人民指出了前进的方向，指出了“枪杆子里面出政权”的光辉的道路。
    田幸一直在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，努力用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑。前年年底，中国经济贸易展览会在名古屋市举行时，有一天，日本右翼暴徒在日本警察当局的唆使和纵容下到展览会会场前捣乱和挑衅。田幸同其他日本朋友一起，为了保卫展览会、保卫日中友好事业，勇敢地同右翼暴徒进行了搏斗，当场腰部负了重伤。但是，他在医院治疗时也坚持学习毛主席著作，在病床上认真阅读《毛泽东选集》。
    现在，田幸每天都把红色宝书《毛主席语录》带在身边，遇到了问题，就向毛主席请教。他说：“我要一辈子听毛主席的话，为日本人民的解放事业奋斗终身。”最强大的思想武器
    光焰无际的毛泽东思想是战胜帝修反的最强大的思想武器。有了毛泽东思想，就有了明确的斗争方向，就会有无穷的智慧、无限的勇气和无比的信心。大阪地区的一位卡车司机去年十一月在毛泽东思想鼓舞下，毅然地造了美帝国主义和日本反动派的帮凶日共修正主义的反。他从宫本修正主义集团的一系列罪恶活动中认识到，宫本修正主义集团走的是一条背叛革命的“议会道路”。日共修正主义集团的喉舌《赤旗报》连篇累牍刊登的反对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的文章，表明它和美帝国主义、日本反动政府是一丘之貉。这位司机强调说：“只有用毛泽东思想武装日本工人，日本革命才能胜利。”
    自从这位司机造了宫本集团的反以后，日共修正主义分子对他怀恨在心，唆使一些不明真相的人，企图把他从工会干部的岗位上赶走。但是，这位司机遵循毛主席关于相信群众、依靠群众的教导，深入群众，同群众一道展开针锋相对的斗争，使日共修正主义分子的阴谋遭到破产。
    这位日本工人热情地赞扬毛主席。他说：“毛主席不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，也是我们日本人民的伟大领袖。”这位司机从十几年前就开始阅读毛主席的光辉哲学著作《实践论》和《矛盾论》，并系统地阅读了《毛泽东选集》。现在，他分析日本的实际情况，努力学习“老三篇”。他说，在日本，统治阶级用各种卑鄙的手段腐蚀工人阶级，所以，我们必须经常学习“老三篇”，不断地同自己的私心进行斗争，以便更好地为日本革命献身。
    这位司机强调说，“我们今天正处在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的伟大时代，正因为这样，我们就更应当好好学习毛泽东思想，把毛主席的每一篇著作都当作座右铭来学。”在“用”字上狠下功夫
    京都一位热爱毛主席、热爱毛泽东思想的女大学生，通过学习毛主席著作，逐步地认识到知识分子必须深入工农群众，参加体力劳动，改造自己的世界观和思想感情。
    她向中国记者说，她学习了毛主席的光辉著作《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》以后，受到了极其深刻的教育。这位女大学生同其他青年朋友一起，同来自帝修反的各种破坏和阻挠活动进行斗争，积极地开展日中友好运动。她利用休息时间，热情洋溢地同大家一道写标语、撒传单、抓学习、搞宣传。她在斗争实践中，深切地感到过去的学习是脱离实际的，认识到理论必须与实践相结合。
    为了勉励自己和帮助同志，她在日中友协（正统）京都总部的办公室墙上挂着林彪副主席在《毛主席语录》再版前言中的一段话：“学习毛主席著作，要带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在‘用’字上狠下功夫。”她说：“我认为林彪副主席提出的学习毛主席著作的这一方法，是世界上最好的方法，我要好好地学习毛主席著作。”热情宣传毛泽东思想
    一些朝气蓬勃的京都革命青年，在中国无产阶级文化大革命的鼓舞下，不久前成立了一个毛泽东思想宣传队。参加这个宣传队的有工人、青年、学生和专门从事日中友好运动的活动家。
    一位胸前佩戴着金光闪闪的毛主席像章的女队员说：“我们不仅自己要活学活用毛泽东思想，而且还要积极宣传毛泽东思想。现在，美帝国主义和日本佐藤反动政府加紧勾结，压迫日本人民。宫本集团已经堕落为反革命。日本人民掀起的反对帝修反的斗争，正一浪高过一浪，战斗的日本人民如饥似渴地要求掌握毛泽东思想。”
    这支刚诞生不久的毛泽东思想宣传队，虽然人数还不多，但是他们有一股冲天的革命干劲和旺盛的革命热情。他们利用业余时间，坚持每星期排练一次。在排练前，共同朗读毛主席语录。他们还专门安排时间学习“老三篇”和《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，努力树立无产阶级的文艺思想，批判资产阶级文艺思想。
    为了配合日益高涨的日本人民的反美爱国斗争，这支毛泽东思想宣传队把日本革命群众去年十月八日在羽田机场为反对佐藤去台湾进行阴谋活动，而同日本武装警察展开英勇斗争的动人场面，编成活报剧演出，受到群众的热烈欢迎。最近，他们练唱了许多用毛主席语录谱写的歌曲和颂扬毛主席的歌曲，并积极排练他们集体创作的短剧《为人民服务》。
