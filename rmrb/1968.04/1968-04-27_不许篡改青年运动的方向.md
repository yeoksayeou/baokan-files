The top capitalist-roader within the Party is using every means to distort the direction of the youth movement. He tells us young people that "the revolution is almost complete, the enemy has been defeated, ... your task is to build, to make the country industrialized." He also says, "Some comrades say that workers now want to study culture and technology and do not want to study politics, this is good." This is a slander against our workers and a big deception!

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In socialist society, class and class struggle still exist." Chairman Mao repeatedly teaches us, "Never forget class struggle," and "Politics must take command." The top capitalist-roader within the Party does not mention class struggle or socialist revolution, but instead says that the task of our socialist period is merely "construction," trying to deceive us young people into not caring about politics and focusing only on business. This is a public opposition to politics taking command and a promotion of business taking command, attempting to make us young people indifferent to national affairs, lose our political direction, and allow him to seize the Party and the country, aiming to restore capitalism in China. His wolfish ambitions are extremely vile!

In the past, under the influence of the Chinese Khrushchev, our factory's Communist Youth League work once had the wrong tendency of not focusing on politics but only on business. The Youth League organization did not emphasize studying Chairman Mao's works but instead emphasized business. On Youth League days, apart from labor and production, there was only boating, swimming, and dancing. At that time, class struggle in our factory was extremely sharp. The management power was seized by capitalists and their agents. A reactionary capitalist even became the factory director. Revolutionary incidents occurred but were not handled for a long time. Due to the Chinese Khrushchev's promotion of material incentives, some workers often argued over bonuses, causing disunity and affecting production.

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution smashed the top capitalist-roader within the Party's counter-revolutionary plot. In the magnificent mass movement, the revolutionary youth in our factory, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, became revolutionary pioneers. We young workers, together with the broad revolutionary masses, overthrew the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party in our factory and seized their power. All revolutionary workers in the factory responded to Chairman Mao's call to "save and make revolution," adhering to the eight-hour workday system.

After more than a year of the Cultural Revolution, the spiritual outlook of our young workers has greatly changed. A revolutionary, combative, and vigorous youth contingent is rapidly growing.

Chairman Mao points out: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." Our factory's revolutionary youth and the broad masses of workers, by focusing on revolution, have also achieved great victories in production. In early 1968, the number of major repairs per month increased from thirty-five to forty, and the production of trailers per month increased from sixteen to twenty-four. Our factory also established an old car repair workshop, vigorously promoting technological revolution and innovation, and producing the repair of old parts. Currently, our factory has dispatched seventy workers to support other places, and everyone unanimously vows to reduce personnel without reducing production, ensuring the completion of the tasks assigned by the Party and the state.

Chairman Mao recently teaches us: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution under the conditions of socialism, where the proletariat opposes the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its led revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." We must study and apply Chairman Mao's works, deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism, and actively and persistently launch attacks on class enemies. We must follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, continuously raise our awareness of class struggle and line struggle, and strive for new achievements in the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    不许篡改青年运动的方向
    北京市运输公司汽车修理厂　共青团通讯小组
    党内最大的走资派千方百计篡改青年运动的方向。他对我们青年胡说什么：“革命是搞得差不多了，敌人已被打倒，……你们学习的任务是建设，是使国家工业化”。他还胡说什么：“有的同志说，工人现在要求学习文化和技术，不愿学政治，这很好。”这是对我们工人的污蔑，也是一个大骗局！
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“社会主义社会还存在着阶级和阶级斗争。”毛主席还一再教导我们“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”，“要政治挂帅”。党内最大的走资派闭口不谈阶级斗争，闭口不谈社会主义革命，而把我国社会主义时期的任务说成只是“建设”，诱骗我们青年不问政治，埋头业务。这就是公开反对政治挂帅，鼓吹业务挂帅，妄图使我们青年不关心国家大事，迷失政治方向，好让他肆无忌惮地篡党篡国，在中国实现资本主义复辟。狼子野心，何其毒也！
    过去在中国赫鲁晓夫的影响下，我们厂的共青团工作中就一度出现了不抓政治、只抓业务的错误倾向。团组织不抓青年学习毛主席著作，片面地强调业务。过团日除了劳动生产以外，就是划船、游泳和跳舞等等。当时在我们厂，阶级斗争是极其尖锐的。生产管理大权被资本家及其代理人篡夺了。一个反动资本家居然当了厂长。发生反革命事件，也长期不处理。由于中国赫鲁晓夫推行物质刺激，有的工人常为奖金而争吵，闹不团结，影响生产。
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，粉碎了党内最大的走资派的反革命阴谋。在轰轰烈烈的群众运动中，我们厂的革命青年，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，成了革命的闯将。我们青年工人和广大革命职工一起，造了我们厂的党内一小撮走资派的反，夺了他们的权。全厂革命职工响应毛主席“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召，坚持八小时工作制。
    经过一年多文化大革命，我们青年工人的精神面貌有了很大改变。一支革命的战斗的朝气勃勃的青年队伍，正在迅速地成长起来。
    毛主席指出：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”我们厂的革命青年和广大职工，由于抓了革命，在生产上也取得了巨大的胜利。一九六八年初，大修车每月由原来的三十五辆提高到四十辆，挂车生产每月也由原来的十六辆提高到二十四辆。我们厂还成立了一个修旧车间，大搞技术革命和技术革新，开展修复旧配件生产。目前，我们厂抽出七十名工人支援外地，大家一致表示要减人不减产，保证完成党和国家交给我们的任务。
    毛主席最近教导我们：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”我们要活学活用毛主席著作，深入持久地开展革命的大批判，主动持久地向阶级敌人发动进攻。我们要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，不断提高阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利立新功。
