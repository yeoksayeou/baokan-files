The Ministry of Coal recently held a field meeting on frugality for revolution and the reuse of old materials in the coal mines of East China and Northeast China at the Zaozhuang Mining Bureau in Shandong. The meeting called on the revolutionary cadres and the broad masses of revolutionary workers in the national coal mining system to raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fully implement Chairman Mao's great policies of "frugality for revolution" and "frugal construction of the country," carry forward the revolutionary spirit of hard work and self-reliance, and wage a "people's war" of frugality and the reuse of old materials to welcome a new high tide in coal industry production and construction.

The meeting promoted the experiences of the Zaozhuang mining area in frugality for revolution and the reuse of old materials. The revolutionary cadres of the Zaozhuang mining area, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, raised high the banner of revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticized the revisionist line advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the mining area, and firmly implemented Chairman Mao's great policies of "grasp revolution, promote production" and "frugality for revolution" on the basis of revolutionary criticism. They overcame many difficulties, achieving higher coal production each month and stable, high production. They also carried out extensive reuse of old materials, saving raw materials from all aspects. From August last year to February this year, the entire mining area recovered and repaired metal pillars, conveyor chains, various steel materials, and other idle and discarded equipment and tools worth more than 2.12 million yuan, ensuring the supply of equipment, parts, and tools needed for coal production.

The delegates, following Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle," used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to criticize the counter-revolutionary economism advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents on the coal industry front, as well as the revisionist poisons of material incentives, profit-seeking, extravagance, and waste. They further raised their class consciousness. Everyone unanimously recognized that frugality and waste are fundamental expressions of the opposition between the worldviews of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Frugality for revolution and the reuse of old materials are not just economic issues but are major issues of class struggle, two lines, and two roads. They are major issues of preventing revisionism and preventing the restoration of capitalism, and they are also major issues of whether the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat can grasp and use power well.

The meeting believed that to do a good job of frugality for revolution and the reuse of old materials, it is necessary to mobilize the masses extensively and wage a "people's war." The meeting required revolutionary workers nationwide to resolutely fight against extravagance, waste, and the arbitrary loss and damage of state equipment, creating a strong public opinion that praises frugality as glorious, waste as shameful, and destruction as criminal, making frugality for revolution a conscious mass action.

"Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." The meeting believed that to do a good job of frugality for revolution and the reuse of old materials, the fundamental approach is to organize revolutionary workers nationwide to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought actively, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, transform everything, and promote the revolutionary transformation of people's thinking. The meeting called on the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat and the broad masses of revolutionary workers nationwide to be loyal to Chairman Mao, grasp the use of Mao Zedong Thought, promote the revolutionary transformation of people's thinking, and fully implement Chairman Mao's great instruction of "frugality for revolution" in terms of thought and organization. They should carry out the mass movement of frugality for revolution and the reuse of old materials thoroughly and sustainably.

    煤炭部在枣庄矿务局召开现场会议号召全国煤矿职工
    落实毛主席节约闹革命的方针  迎接煤炭工业生产建设新高潮
    发扬艰苦奋斗、自力更生的精神，打一场勤俭节约、修旧利废的“人民战争”
    新华社济南十一日电　煤炭部最近在山东枣庄矿务局召开华东、东北煤矿节约闹革命修旧利废现场会议。会议号召全国煤矿系统的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，全面落实毛主席“要节约闹革命”和“勤俭建国”的伟大方针，发扬艰苦奋斗、自力更生的革命精神，打一场勤俭节约、修旧利废的“人民战争”，迎接煤炭工业生产建设的新高潮。
    会议推广了枣庄矿区节约闹革命，修旧利废的经验。枣庄矿区的无产阶级革命派紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，高举革命大批判的旗帜，彻底批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在矿区的代理人推行的修正主义路线，在革命大批判的基础上，坚定不移地贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”、“要节约闹革命”的伟大方针，克服了很多困难，煤产量一月高过一月，作到了稳产高产。他们还大搞修旧利废，从各方面来节约原材料，从去年八月到今年二月，全矿区共回收修复金属支柱、溜子大链、各种钢材以及其他闲置废旧设备器材等价值二百一十二万多元，保证了煤炭生产所需要的设备、配件和器材的供应。
    到会代表遵照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，以毛泽东思想为武器，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在煤炭工业战线的代理人所推行的反革命经济主义，以及物质刺激、利润挂帅，铺张浪费等修正主义流毒，进一步提高了阶级觉悟。大家一致认识到，节约和浪费是无产阶级世界观同资产阶级世界观根本对立的表现。节约闹革命，修旧利废，绝不仅仅是一个经济问题，而是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的大问题，是防修、反修、防止资本主义复辟的大问题，也是关系到无产阶级革命派能不能掌好权、用好权的大问题。
    会议认为，搞好节约闹革命和修旧利废的工作，必须广泛发动群众，打一场“人民战争”。会议要求全国煤矿广大革命职工坚决同铺张浪费、任意丢失损坏国家器材的行为作斗争，造成节约光荣，浪费可耻，破坏有罪的强烈社会舆论，使节约闹革命成为群众性的自觉行动。
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”会议认为，搞好节约闹革命，修旧利废的根本是组织广大革命职工活学活用毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，改造一切，促进人的思想革命化。会议号召全国煤矿无产阶级革命派及广大革命群众对毛主席突出一个“忠”字，对毛泽东思想狠抓一个“用”字，搞好人的思想革命化，从思想上、组织上全面落实毛主席“要节约闹革命”的伟大指示，把节约闹革命、修旧利废的群众运动全面地持久地开展下去。
