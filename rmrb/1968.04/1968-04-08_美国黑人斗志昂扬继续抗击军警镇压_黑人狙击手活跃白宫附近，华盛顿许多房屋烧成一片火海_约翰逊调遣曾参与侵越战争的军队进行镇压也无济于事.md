Black snipers active near the White House, many homes in Washington reduced to ashes

Johnson deploys troops who participated in the Vietnam War to suppress the unrest, to no avail

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated April 7th, Washington: The armed resistance by Black Americans has spread across the entire country and entered its third day. In cities such as Washington and Chicago, Black communities, with unyielding fighting spirit, bravely resist the brutal suppression by large numbers of reactionary military and police forces. Facing the surging wave of Black resistance, the head of the American empire, Johnson, is restless, as urgent pleas for help from reactionary authorities in various cities across the nation make him fidgety in the White House.

In the capital, Washington, the armed resistance by Black communities remained intense on the 6th. Black communities, filled with hatred towards the atrocities of white racists, continued to set fire to white-owned stores in the city center using gasoline and Molotov cocktails. By the morning of the 6th, over 250 stores had caught fire, with entire rows of buildings reduced to smoky infernos in some places.

At the same time, brave Black snipers opened fire on low-flying helicopters monitoring them. They were even active near the heavily guarded White House and Capitol Building, shooting at reactionary military and police forces. As night fell, the gunshots from Black snipers became more frequent.

The Johnson administration, shaken by the brave struggles of Blacks over the past two days, deployed large numbers of paratroopers and marines to assist the army, police, and "National Guard" in the brutal suppression of Black communities. By the 6th, the number of regular troops participating in the suppression of Blacks had reached 12,500, including the 82nd Airborne Division, which had previously massacred the Vietnamese people in Vietnam and suppressed domestic struggles. Reports indicated that on this day, around 2,000 to 3,000 Blacks were arbitrarily arrested.

In Chicago, after a day of intense resistance on the 5th, Black communities continued to bravely fight against white racists and fascist military and police forces on the 6th. By the 6th, Chicago had experienced 1,000 fire incidents, with 250 locations engulfed in fierce flames. Black snipers shot at military and police forces from rooftops or behind doors and windows. The snipers' shooting forced police cars to patrol at night without headlights. The reactionary local authorities sent urgent pleas for help to the White House, and Johnson ruthlessly dispatched 5,000 regular troops to strengthen the suppression.

In Baltimore, the sixth-largest city in the United States, Black communities engaged in five hours of intense resistance on the 6th. Large groups of Black youth marched and demonstrated in the city, setting fire to white-owned stores. The reactionary authorities deployed 6,000 members of the "National Guard" to brutally suppress the Black communities, resulting in ten police officers being injured by the angry Black crowds.

In Nashville, Tennessee, Black students at the state university held a powerful demonstration on the 6th, protesting the reactionary military and police forces' unjustified shooting of two of their fellow students on the 5th. Black students also opened fire on the military and police forces surrounding the school. Despite the brutal suppression by reactionary military and police forces, Black communities in New York, Detroit, Memphis, and other cities continued their struggles.

The brave and tenacious struggles of Black communities across various American cities over the past few days have once again demonstrated the awakening of Black Americans and the immense power they possess.

    美国黑人斗志昂扬继续抗击军警镇压

    约翰逊调遣曾参与侵越战争的军队进行镇压也无济于事
    据新华社七日讯　华盛顿消息：美国全国范围内掀起的黑人武力抗暴斗争，六日进入了第三天。华盛顿、芝加哥等许多城市的黑人群众，发扬威武不屈的战斗精神，英勇地抗击大批反动军警的血腥镇压。面对着汹涌澎湃的黑人抗暴斗争浪潮，美帝头子约翰逊坐立不安，从全国许多城市反动当局向他发出的告急求援电报，使得他象热锅上的蚂蚁，在白宫里团团转。
    在首都华盛顿，黑人群众的武力抗暴斗争六日仍然非常激烈。对白人种族主义者的暴行怀着满腔仇恨的黑人群众，继续用汽油和燃烧瓶在市中心的商业区放火烧毁白人种族主义者的商店。仅在六日上午，就有二百五十多家商店起火，有的地方，整排整排的建筑物被烧成一片烟雾火海。
    与此同时，英勇的黑人狙击手开枪射击在低空盘旋监视他们的直升飞机。他们甚至活跃在戒备森严的白宫和国会建筑物附近，射击反动军警。入夜以后，黑人狙击手的枪声越来越密。
    被过去两天黑人的英勇斗争吓破了胆的约翰逊政府，出动大批伞兵和海军陆战队配合陆军、警察和“国民警卫队”对黑人群众进行血腥镇压。到六日为止，参加镇压黑人的正规军共有一万二千五百人，其中包括曾经在越南屠杀越南人民和在国内镇压过群众斗争的第八十二空降师部队。据报道，这一天有两三千黑人横遭逮捕。
    芝加哥的黑人群众继五日一整天猛烈的抗暴斗争之后，六日继续同白人种族主义者和法西斯军警进行英勇搏斗。到六日为止，芝加哥共发生了一千起火警，有二百五十处火势猛烈。黑人狙击手从屋顶上或门窗背后射击军警。狙击手的射击迫使警车在夜间巡逻时不敢开车灯。反动地方当局向白宫告急求援，约翰逊悍然调拨五千名正规军前去加强镇压。
    在美国第六大城市巴尔的摩，黑人群众六日进行了连续五小时的激烈的抗暴斗争。大群大群的黑人青年在市内游行示威，放火烧白人商店。反动当局出动六千名
  “国民警卫队”野蛮镇压黑人群众，十名警察被愤怒的黑人群众打伤。
    在田纳西州的纳什维尔，州立大学的黑人学生六日在校园内举行了强大的示威，抗议反动军警在五日无端开枪打伤他们的两名同学。黑人学生还开枪射击包围这所学校的军警。在纽约、底特律、孟菲斯以及其他城市，尽管反动军警残酷镇压，黑人群众仍然在坚持斗争。
    美国各城市的广大黑人群众连日来进行的英勇顽强的斗争，再次显示了美国黑人的觉醒和他们中间蕴藏着的强大力量。
