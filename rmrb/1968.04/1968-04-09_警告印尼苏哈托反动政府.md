The running dog of American imperialism, Suharto, soon after seizing the title of "president," dispatched a "trade" delegation to Taiwan to sign a so-called "loan agreement" with the Chiang bandit clique. This is an important step in the collusion between the Indonesian fascist military regime and the political zombie Chiang Kai-shek, and it is an extremely serious provocation against the 700 million Chinese people.

The Indonesian fascist military regime, under the direction of American imperialism, has accelerated its collusion with the Chiang bandit clique, yet it shamelessly claims that this "loan agreement" was signed by the "business community," as if it were merely a "private" affair. This deceitful trick is extremely stupid. The close ties between the Indonesian reactionaries and the Chiang bandits are plain for all to see. They frequently exchange visits and openly declare their intention to "recognize" the Chiang bandits and establish so-called "business institutions." The Indonesian fascist military clique's current attempts to hide and deceive are a clear sign of their guilty conscience.

In fact, since the Indonesian fascist military clique staged a counter-revolutionary coup in October 1965, they have systematically launched large-scale anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese campaigns, step by step tightening their collusion with the Chiang bandit clique. High-ranking officials and military officers of the Indonesian reactionary government, as well as various delegations, have continuously visited Taiwan to engage in conspiratorial activities. The "trade delegations" of the Chiang bandits have also visited Jakarta. The Indonesian reactionary government has also sent batches of reactionary military personnel to Taiwan to receive "special military training." The Chiang bandits and the Suharto fascist military clique are preparing to open air and sea routes between Taiwan and Indonesia. All of this fully demonstrates that the Indonesian fascist military regime is not only economically, but also politically, militarily, and culturally, intensifying its comprehensive collusion with the Chiang bandit clique.

The Suharto-led Indonesian fascist military clique, on the one hand, fears the opposition of the broad revolutionary people of Indonesia and is forced to hypocritically acknowledge the People's Republic of China. On the other hand, due to their reactionary class nature, they are intensifying their comprehensive collusion with the Chiang bandits, who are despised by the Chinese people, and are following the American imperialists in plotting to create "two Chinas." The Indonesian reactionary government is playing a extremely despicable counter-revolutionary double game.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "There is an old Chinese saying, 'Birds of a feather flock together.' It is no surprise that the Indonesian fascist military clique is intensifying its collusion with the Chiang bandit clique. The former is a running dog of imperialism, while the latter is a political zombie under the protection of American imperialism; the former is a small group of the most reactionary counter-revolutionary scum in Indonesia, while the latter is a gang of bandits who have long been despised by the Chinese people. The two are birds of a feather.

We sternly warn the Suharto fascist military government: Following in the footsteps of American imperialism, attempting to create "two Chinas" to oppose the great Chinese people, will lead to no good end. The Chinese people are closely watching the further development of the situation. If the Suharto fascist military government ignores the solemn warning of the Chinese people and persists in its course, it will only end up lifting a rock to drop on its own feet!

    警告印尼苏哈托反动政府
    本报评论员
    美帝国主义的走狗苏哈托，在自封“总统”以后不久，派遣“贸易”代表团到台湾，与蒋匪帮签订了所谓“贷款协定”。这是印尼法西斯军人政权同政治僵尸蒋介石匪帮加紧勾结的一个重要步骤，是对七亿中国人民极端严重的挑衅。
    印尼法西斯军人政权，明明是在美帝国主义的指使下，加快了同蒋介石匪帮勾结的步伐，却竭力标榜这次“贷款协定”是由“工商界”签订的，似乎只是“民间”往来。这种掩耳盗铃的伎俩是极端愚蠢的。印尼反动派与蒋介石匪帮打得火热，这是有目共睹的事实。他们与蒋匪帮来往频繁，并且公开叫嚷要“承认”蒋匪帮，还要同蒋匪帮互设所谓“商务机构”。印尼法西斯军人集团现在所以还这样躲躲闪闪，企图掩人耳目，正表明了印尼反动派作贼心虚。
    事实上，自从印尼法西斯军人集团于一九六五年十月发动反革命政变以来，它就有计划地不断掀起大规模的反华排华浪潮，步步加紧同蒋介石匪帮勾搭。印尼反动政府的高级官员和军官，以及形形色色的代表团，接连不断地到台湾去进行阴谋活动。蒋匪帮的“贸易代表团”也跑到雅加达“访问”。印尼反动政权还派遣一批批反动军人到台湾接受“特种军事训练”。蒋介石匪帮和苏哈托法西斯军人集团正在准备开辟台湾、印尼之间的空运和货轮航线。所有这些充分说明，印尼法西斯军人政权不仅在经济上，而且在政治、军事、文化等方面加紧同蒋介石匪帮进行全面勾结。
    以苏哈托为首的印尼法西斯军人集团，一方面害怕印尼广大革命人民的反对，不得不假惺惺地承认中华人民共和国；另一方面，出于他们的反动阶级本性，又同为中国人民所唾弃的蒋匪帮加紧全面勾结，追随美帝国主义制造“两个中国”的阴谋。印尼反动政府玩弄的是极端卑鄙的反革命两面手法。
    我们的伟大导师毛主席说：“中国有句古话，物以类聚，人以群分。”印尼法西斯军人集团变本加厉地勾结蒋介石匪帮，这是不足为怪的。前者是帝国主义的走狗，后者是美帝国主义卵翼下的一具政治僵尸；前者是印尼的一小撮最反动的反革命渣滓，后者则是早就为中国人民所唾弃了的一伙匪帮。两家完全是一丘之貉。
    我们要严厉警告苏哈托法西斯军人政权：你们跟着美帝国主义屁股后面跑，妄图制造“两个中国”的阴谋，来反对伟大的中国人民，是决不会有好下场的。中国人民正在密切注视事态的进一步发展。如果苏哈托法西斯军人政府不顾中国人民的严正警告，一意孤行下去，到头来只能是搬起石头砸自己的脚！
