Editor's Note: "Revolutionary Committees Must Lead the Masses in Sustained Revolutionary Criticism" is a good article. We hope comrades will read it carefully.

Why has the Laoshan County Revolutionary Committee been able to raise high the banner of revolutionary criticism and carry out deep and sustained revolutionary criticism? The fundamental reason is that they have combined the actual situation in their county with the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought and Mao Zedong's great teachings on class and class struggle, thereby deeply understanding the essence of the class enemy.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To create disorder, fail, create disorder again, fail again, until they are wiped out—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world in dealing with the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic." In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the handful of traitors, spies, diehard capitalist-roaders, and unrepentant landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements who have been overthrown and exposed are also bound by this logic. They are indeed like "winter onions, withered outside but alive inside." Given any opportunity, they will definitely try to reverse their verdicts and counterattack the revolutionary people. Our struggle with this handful of enemies is a life-and-death class struggle. If we do not take the initiative to attack, the enemy will launch a ferocious counterattack. Unless we thoroughly criticize and expose them in thought, politics, and theory, they will continue to stir up trouble and engage in various clandestine sabotage activities.

We must learn from the thorough revolutionary spirit of the Laoshan County Revolutionary Committee and take the initiative to launch sustained and comprehensive attacks on the class enemy. Only in this way can the newly established revolutionary committees be consolidated, and our great socialist state remain unshakable.

Through a year of revolutionary struggle, we have deeply felt that revolutionary committees must follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, grasp class struggle, and lead the masses to carry out deep and sustained revolutionary criticism. Only in this way can we grasp the revolution, promote production, and continuously consolidate and develop the revolutionary committees.

The Key to Carrying the Cultural Revolution to the End

After the establishment of our county's revolutionary committee, some leading members once harbored complacency and underestimation, thinking that since we had seized power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party in Laoshan County, the task at hand was to do a good job and focus on production. However, the laws of class struggle are not subject to human will. If you do not thoroughly defeat the class enemy, they will rise again to counterattack! Soon after the establishment of the Laoshan County Revolutionary Committee, the class enemy directed their struggle at the revolutionary committee, using every means to smear the faces of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, falsely claiming that "small figures" cannot hold power, attempting to strangle the newly born revolutionary power and negate the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

With the help of the PLA support team stationed in Laoshan County, the leading members of the county revolutionary committee seriously studied Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Carry the Revolution Through to the End" and related discussions on class struggle.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must never relax our vigilance against the cunning and desperate attempts at revenge by the imperialist elements and their running dogs just because we have won victories. Whoever relaxes this vigilance will be disarmed politically and put in a passive position."

Comrade Lin Biao pointed out that the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, though few in number, have great political energy, and their resistance is much stronger than their numerical proportion. Chairman Mao's teachings deeply educated us, making us further strengthen our class struggle consciousness, raise our class struggle and line struggle awareness. We realized that seizing power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party organizationally does not mean we have also seized their power politically and ideologically. Only by thoroughly criticizing and exposing them politically, ideologically, and theoretically can we eliminate their influence and prevent the capitalist-roaders from making a comeback. Whether or not to grasp the revolutionary criticism is a big issue concerning whether to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end or to give up halfway. Only by firmly grasping the revolutionary criticism can the revolutionary committee truly hold and use power well.

We resolutely follow Chairman Mao's teachings and Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, grasp class struggle, and grasp revolutionary criticism, determined to make the revolutionary committee a strong command post for class struggle. The leading members of our revolutionary committee go to the front lines of revolutionary criticism, serving both as commanders and fighters, together with the broad revolutionary masses, launching fierce attacks on China's Khrushchev and his agents. At the same time, we also launched attacks on unrepentant landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and other counter-revolutionaries. From workshops, fields, offices, classrooms to homes, revolutionary criticism battlefields are set up everywhere. The waves of revolutionary criticism shake the land of Laoshan, making the class enemies tremble with fear, and their plots to sabotage the revolutionary committee one by one meet with shameful failure. The broad revolutionary masses continuously raise their class consciousness through revolutionary criticism, and the revolutionary committee is also continuously consolidated and developed in the storms of class struggle.

Taking the Initiative, Sustained, and Comprehensive Attacks on the Enemy

To carry out revolutionary criticism well, we must launch offensive battles. Soon after the establishment of the county revolutionary committee, the class enemy blew a gust of evil wind, claiming that our dictatorship over the bad elements is a "new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line," attempting to obstruct the revolutionary committee from implementing proletarian dictatorship. Chairman Mao said: "Resolutely suppress all counter-revolutionaries and make our revolutionary dictatorship greatly consolidated, so as to carry the revolution through to the end." We studied Chairman Mao's teachings and mobilized the revolutionary masses throughout the county to severely criticize China's Khrushchev and his agents for advocating the theory of "extinguishing class struggle," attempting to abolish proletarian dictatorship. The broad revolutionary masses heightened their revolutionary vigilance, and some deceived masses also opened their eyes, saw through the class enemy's plots, and realized that the revolutionary committee is truly revolutionary, and the dictatorship over the bad elements is completely correct. Everyone united to fight the enemy, smashing the class enemy's plots.

To carry out revolutionary criticism well, we must have the spirit of continuous battles.

The capitalist-roaders in our county, soon after the establishment of the county revolutionary committee, disguised themselves as "revolutionaries" and vigorously obstructed the release of genuine revolutionary cadres. We mobilized the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses throughout the county to launch four large-scale criticisms against this handful of capitalist-roaders, layer by layer peeling off their masks, exposing their counter-revolutionary revisionist true faces, and making the broad revolutionary masses see their ugly faces. This also made the broad revolutionary masses recognize the essential difference between proletarian leaders in power and capitalist-roaders in power, raising their understanding of Chairman Mao's cadre policy, thereby greatly promoting the release and combination of revolutionary cadres.

To carry out revolutionary criticism well, we must launch comprehensive attacks on counter-revolutionary revisionism. We not only need to eliminate the poison spread by China's Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party in the political and ideological fields but also need to eliminate the poison they spread in the economic front, organizational work, and other aspects.

In the economic front, we mainly focus on several key points such as spring plowing, summer harvest, autumn harvest, and distribution, combining with the central tasks, widely propagating Chairman Mao's related teachings, organizing the broad poor and lower-middle peasants to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, severely criticizing China's Khrushchev's reactionary fallacies of "three independences and one contract." At the same time, we severely criticize China's Khrushchev's fallacies of "four freedoms," attempting to lead the peasants onto the capitalist road of "getting rich." In this way, we can eliminate counter-revolutionary revisionist poison, raise the class consciousness of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, and also promote the smooth progress of various central tasks.

Last summer, we achieved the first bumper harvest after the proletarian revolutionary masses took power. We anticipated that in the distribution issue, due to the lingering influence of revisionism, there would be a struggle over how to correctly handle the relationship between the state, collective, and individual. We promptly organized the poor and lower-middle peasants to study Chairman Mao's great strategic guideline of "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people" and the principle of "considering the interests of the state, collective, and individual." We established the idea of serving the public wholeheartedly.

The broad poor and lower-middle peasants criticized in the fields, in the courtyards, and in their homes, criticizing these revisionist goods "so smelly that the wind can carry the smell for three miles." The class enemy once spread the reactionary theory of "selling less and keeping more," attempting to stir up the counter-revolutionary economic wind, sabotaging the summer grain procurement work. Due to the launch of revolutionary criticism, the distribution issue was raised to the height of the struggle between the two lines, and this undercurrent was quickly submerged. The poor and lower-middle peasants throughout the county enthusiastically sold summer grain to the state, exceeding the procurement task, expressing the poor and lower-middle peasants' loyalty to Chairman Mao.

We also pay attention to launching revolutionary criticism in the party-building line. For decades, China's Khrushchev, through his black book "On the Cultivation of the Self" and other poisonous weeds, spread a set of revisionist goods in the party-building line. Among them, the theory of "production center" is widely spread. From party membership to party member evaluation, production performance is used as the main standard, and party members' performance in class struggle is not used as the main standard. China's Khrushchev is attempting to turn our party into an "industrial party" and "agricultural party," only managing production and not engaging in class struggle, a revisionist party. The county revolutionary committee organized the broad party members and revolutionary masses throughout the county to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "The party organization should be composed of advanced elements of the proletariat and should be able to lead the proletariat and revolutionary masses in fighting against the class enemy, a vigorous vanguard organization." The broad party members and revolutionary masses used Chairman Mao's brilliant party-building thoughts to severely criticize China's Khrushchev's theory of "production center" and other revisionist goods, thoroughly exposing the serious consequences caused by these revisionist fallacies.

    革委会要带领群众持久地开展革命大批判
    山东省青岛市崂山县革命委员会
    编者按：《革委会要带领群众持久地开展革命大批判》是篇好文章。希望同志们仔细地读一读。
    崂山县革命委员会为什么能够高举革命批判的大旗，深入地、持久地开展革命的大批判？根本的原因，是他们能够结合本县的实际情况，活学活用毛泽东思想，活学活用毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的伟大教导，深刻地认识了阶级敌人的本质。
    毛主席教导我们：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”在这次史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，被打倒、被揪出来的一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派和没有改造好的地富反坏右分子，也同样是不会违背这个逻辑的。他们确实象“冬天的大葱，皮焦根枯心不死”。一有机会，他们就一定要翻案，一定要向革命人民反攻倒算。我们和这一小撮敌人的斗争，是你死我活的阶级斗争。你不主动进攻，敌人就会猖狂反扑。不把他们从思想上、政治上、理论上彻底批倒批臭，他们仍然会兴风作浪，从事种种阴谋破坏活动。
    我们要学习崂山县革命委员会这种彻底革命精神，主动地、持久地、全面地向阶级敌人进攻。只有这样，新生的革命委员会才能巩固，我们伟大的社会主义江山才能永不变色。
    通过一年来革命斗争的实践，我们深深体会到，革命委员会必须紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠抓阶级斗争，领导群众深入地持久地开展革命大批判。这样，才能抓好革命，促进生产，革命委员会也才能不断地巩固和发展。
    把文化大革命进行到底的重要关键
    我们县革委会成立以后，有的领导成员一度产生了轻敌麻痹思想，认为我们已经夺了崂山县党内一小撮走资派的权，摆在面前的任务就是干好工作，抓好生产。但是，阶级斗争的规律是不以人的意志为转移的。对阶级敌人，你不把他彻底打倒，他就爬起来反扑！崂山县革委会成立不久，阶级敌人就把斗争矛头指向革委会，千方百计往无产阶级革命派脸上抹黑，胡说什么“小人物”不能掌权，妄想以此来扼杀新生的革命政权，来否定无产阶级文化大革命。
    在人民解放军驻崂山县支左部队的帮助下，县革委会领导成员认真学习了毛主席的光辉著作《将革命进行到底》和有关阶级斗争的论述。
    毛主席教导我们说：“我们决不可因为胜利，而放松对于帝国主义分子及其走狗们的疯狂的报复阴谋的警惕性，谁要是放松这一项警惕性，谁就将在政治上解除武装，而使自己处于被动的地位。”
    林副主席指出，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，他们人还在，心不死，“他们在整个人口比例上占很少数，但是他们政治上的能量很大，他们的反抗力量比他们的人口比例大得多。”毛主席的教导深刻地教育了我们，使大家进一步增强了阶级斗争观念，提高了阶级斗争觉悟和路线斗争觉悟。大家认识到，我们从组织上夺了党内一小撮走资派的权，并不等于在政治、思想上也夺了他们的权，只有从政治上、思想上、理论上把他们批深批透，斗倒斗臭，才能肃清他们的流毒，使走资派不能卷土重来。是不是狠抓革命的大批判，这是关系到把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底还是半途而废的大问题。革命委员会狠狠抓了革命的大批判，才能真正掌好权用好权。
    我们坚决按照毛主席的教导和林副主席的指示，狠抓阶级斗争，狠抓革命大批判，决心使革委会成为坚强的阶级斗争指挥部。我们革委会领导成员深入革命大批判的第一线，既当指挥员，又当战斗员，和广大革命群众一起，猛烈地向中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人开火。与此同时，对没有改造好的地富反坏右和其他反革命分子也展开了进攻。从车间、田头、机关、课堂到家庭，到处都摆开了大批判的战场。革命大批判的浪涛震撼着崂山大地，使阶级敌人闻风丧胆，使阶级敌人破坏革委会的阴谋一个一个遭到可耻的失败。广大革命群众在革命大批判中不断提高了阶级觉悟，革委会也在阶级斗争的风浪中不断巩固和发展。
    主动、持久、全面地向敌人进攻
    要搞好革命大批判，必须打进攻战。县革委会成立不久，阶级敌人吹出一股妖风，说我们对坏人专政是“资产阶级反动路线的新反扑”，妄图阻挠革委会实行无产阶级专政。毛主席说：“坚决地将一切反革命分子镇压下去，而使我们的革命专政大大地巩固起来，以便将革命进行到底”。我们学习了毛主席的教导，发动全县革命群众狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人鼓吹
  “阶级斗争熄灭”论，妄图取消无产阶级专政的罪行。广大革命群众提高了革命警惕性，一些受蒙蔽的群众也擦亮了眼睛，看清了阶级敌人的阴谋，认识到革命委员会是真正革命的，对坏人的专政完全正确。大家团结起来共同对敌，粉碎了阶级敌人的阴谋。
    要搞好革命大批判，就要有连续作战的精神。
    我们县的走资派在县革委会成立不久，把自己梳妆打扮成“革命”的模样，而极力阻挠真正的革命干部的解放。我们便发动全县贫下中农和革命群众，对这一小撮走资派连续开展了四次大规模的批判，一层一层地剥开这些家伙的画皮，揭露出他们反革命修正主义的真面目，使广大革命群众看清了他们的丑恶嘴脸。这也使广大革命群众认清了无产阶级当权派和走资本主义道路当权派的本质区别，提高了对毛主席的干部政策的认识，因而大大促进了革命干部的解放和结合。
    要搞好革命大批判，就要向反革命修正主义全面进攻。我们不但要肃清中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大一小撮走资派及其代理人在政治、思想领域内散布的修正主义流毒，而且要肃清他们在经济战线、组织工作等方面散布的毒素。
    我们在经济战线上开展革命的大批判，主要是抓住春耕、夏收、秋收、分配等几个环节，结合中心任务，广泛地宣传毛主席的有关教导，组织广大贫下中农以毛泽东思想为武器，狠狠批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“三自一包”等反动谬论。同时，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫要把农民引上“发家致富”的资本主义道路的“四大自由”等谬论。这样，既能清除反革命修正主义流毒，提高广大贫下中农的阶级觉悟，同时也推动了各项中心工作的顺利开展。
    去年夏天，我们取得了无产阶级革命派掌权以后的第一次大丰收。我们预计到在分配问题上，由于修正主义流毒还没有肃清，对于如何正确地处理国家、集体、个人三者关系，将会有一场斗争。我们便及时组织贫下中农学习毛主席的“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大战略方针和“兼顾国家利益、集体利益和个人利益”的原则，树立一心为公的思想。
    广大贫下中农在地头批，在场里批，在家庭批，把这些修正主义黑货批得“逆风臭三里”。阶级敌人曾经散布“少卖点，多留点”的反动论调，企图煽起反革命经济主义妖风，破坏夏粮征购工作。由于开展了革命的大批判，把分配问题提到两条路线斗争的高度来认识，这股暗流很快就被淹没了。全县贫下中农踊跃向国家交售夏粮，超额完成了征购任务，向毛主席他老人家表达了贫下中农的赤胆忠心。
    我们还注意在建党路线方面开展革命的大批判。中国赫鲁晓夫几十年来通过他的黑《修养》等大毒草，在建党路线方面散布了一整套修正主义黑货。其中“生产中心”论流毒甚广。从党员入党到党员鉴定，统统以生产好坏为主要标准，不把党员在阶级斗争中的表现作为主要标准。中国赫鲁晓夫就是妄图把我们的党改造成“工业党”、“农业党”，只管生产、不搞阶级斗争的修正主义党。县革命委员会组织全县广大党员和革命群众，反复学习了毛主席的最新指示：“党组织应是无产阶级先进分子所组成，应能领导无产阶级和革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的朝气蓬勃的先锋队组织。”广大党员和革命群众运用毛主席这一光辉的建党思想，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的“生产中心”论等修正主义黑货，大揭了这些修正主义谬论所造成的严重恶果。
    要搞好革命大批判，就要反复、持久地战斗。革命的大批判不能一劳永逸，一个问题批判过了，还可能出现回生现象。阶级斗争出现一些反复，是难免的。贫下中农说得好：“阶级敌人是冬天的大葱，皮焦根枯心不死。我们千万不能满足已经取得的成绩，必须把革命大批判进行到底，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”我们的作法是，结合不同时期的不同任务，结合本地区本单位阶级斗争的特点，反复地批，持续地批。这样，才能把反革命修正主义货色批深批透，才能使反革命修正主义分子没有复辟的机会。（附图片）
