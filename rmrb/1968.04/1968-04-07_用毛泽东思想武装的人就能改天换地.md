    Those Armed with Mao Zedong Thought Can Change Heaven and Earth
    Zhao Minqing, Platoon Leader of a Certain Unit

    At the beginning of last year, our platoon was tasked with going to a certain place to engage in agricultural production. This was a vast expanse of saline-alkali land. It is said that few people had ever been here before; during the Japanese imperialists' occupation of Northeast China, they had attempted to cultivate this land several times, but all failed.

    Our platoon's plan was to transform this barren land into fertile rice paddies. After a fierce battle and countless hardships, we quickly completed the preparatory work for planting. By early April, we had started sowing and raising seedlings. At this time, colleagues from the reclamation area's scientific research institute came to provide technical guidance. As soon as they got off the car, they rushed to the fields, picked up some alkali soil to examine, picked up some muddy rice seeds to taste, and repeatedly checked the technical materials they brought. Finally, they said with regret, "It's over, it's over, the seeds are almost becoming salted beans." Before leaving, they advised us, "On saline-alkali land, the alkali content should not exceed 0.216%, but here it has reached 1.89%, which has already destroyed the seed structure, and the rice seedlings will not grow." They also suggested that we destroy the dry direct sowing and change it to a seedling field. After hearing the advice from the scientific and technological personnel, the comrades also started discussing. Some comrades suggested, "Just destroy it and save the trouble." Most comrades disagreed. Some said, "It is a fact that the land is highly alkaline, but saying that the high alkalinity cannot be controlled does not conform to the facts." Others said, "High alkalinity is nothing to be afraid of. We should value others' experience, but more importantly, we should value our own practice. I have personally seen the rice sprouts emerging from the shallow water." The discussion finally concluded with everyone unanimously expressing: the high alkalinity is not as great as our determination. We are soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought and will definitely create miracles that others cannot create, growing rice on the saline-alkali land.

    To reduce the alkali content, we need to irrigate and wash away the alkali. When we were washing the alkali to save the seedlings, someone said, "The Japanese invaders once tried to grow rice here, and they even brought rice experts from Tokyo, but the result was a total failure. Now let's see how the PLA does it." The comrades confidently said, "The Japanese imperialists were here for plunder and naturally would not reap a single stalk of rice. We are implementing the great leader Chairman Mao's 'May 7th Directive,' farming for the revolution, and will surely achieve a bumper rice harvest." To wash the alkali and save the seedlings, the soldiers displayed a brave fighting spirit and fearlessness of fatigue. They went to the fields before dawn and returned late at night, changing the water twice a day to four times a day. Finally, they reduced the alkali content from 1.89% to 0.214%, promoting the rice sprouts to vigorously emerge from the soil.

    Upon hearing the news that seedlings had sprouted on the vast saline-alkali land, colleagues from the scientific research institute came. They looked at and touched the seedlings again and again, repeatedly praising, "Amazing, amazing!" Before leaving, they reminded us with concern, "Seeing the seedlings brings three parts joy, but there are still seven parts worry. You must especially pay attention to the summer alkali reversal." Seeing their expressions and listening to their advice, we were both happy and worried. We were happy because the seedlings growing on the saline-alkali land had begun to help these colleagues engaged in scientific research break free from their Western frameworks; we were worried because we did not know if the seedlings could survive the summer alkali reversal.

    By the end of June, the sun was scorching, and the southwest wind was blowing incessantly. The land was scorched from above and steamed from below, causing severe alkali reversal. A large area of rice seedlings turned yellow. Poor and lower-middle class farmers from dozens of miles away were worried about us and came to help us find solutions. However, the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements secretly rejoiced. They mocked, "The PLA is truly amazing, with a spirit of self-reliance and hard work, the rice is planted quickly and 'ripened' quickly."

    What was before us was not just the question of whether we could produce rice, but also whether we could give the class enemies a blow to the head, whether we could dispel the old ideas and habits from the people's minds. More importantly, it was the question of whether we could, through our own thought revolutionization and the material results it brought, demonstrate the unparalleled power of Mao Zedong Thought. Thinking of this, the comrades treated the rice fields as a battlefield, timely changed the water, weeded out the weeds, and did everything possible to carefully manage the fields, finally turning the yellow rice seedlings green.

    During the autumn harvest, the comrades' hands and feet were soaked in alkali water and changed shape, but their feet stood firmer; their faces were tanned, but their hearts were redder. Under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, we finally made the saline-alkali land produce rice, achieving a yield of 400 jin per mu.

    The good news spread, and the colleagues from the scientific research institute who had been concerned about our rice planting came excitedly. They said excitedly and self-critically, "This is a rare miracle. This is true scientific farming. In the past, we only investigated the alkalinity of the soil but did not see your hearts, which are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao." They asked us to share our experience of achieving a bumper rice harvest on the saline-alkali land. The soldiers replied, "The most fundamental point is: a red heart forever loyal to Chairman Mao. When people's minds are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, they can change heaven and earth."

    用毛泽东思想武装的人就能改天换地
    某部连长　赵民清
    去年年初，我们连接受去某地搞农业生产的任务。这是一望无际的盐碱滩。据说，这里过去很少有人到过；日本帝国主义侵占东北时，曾几次试图开垦，都失败了。
    我们连的计划，是把这片不毛之地变成水稻良田。我们经过了一番战斗，经历了千难万苦，很快地完成了备耕任务，到四月初就播种育苗了。这时，垦区科学研究所的同志来作技术指导。他们一下车就跑到田间，捧起碱土看了看，拣起带泥的稻种尝了尝，还反复查看带来的技术资料，最后痛心地说：“完了，完了，种子快成咸盐豆了。”临走时关照我们：“在盐碱地上种水稻，碱分不能超过百分之零点二一六，而这里达到了百分之一点八九，已经破坏了种子结构，稻苗长不出来了。”并建议我们趁早毁掉旱直播，改为稻秧田。同志们听了科技人员的建议，也议论开了。有的同志主张：“干脆毁掉，省得白费劲。”大多数同志不同意。有的说：“说地里碱大是事实，但是说碱大了没法制服，就不符合实际。”有的说：“碱大没有什么了不起。我们要重视别人的经验，更要重视自己的实践，我亲眼看到水浅地方的稻芽已经露出水层。”讨论到最后，大家一致表示：碱大没有我们的决心大。我们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的战士，一定能创造出别人创造不出来的奇迹，在盐碱滩上种出水稻来。
    要降低碱分，就要灌水洗碱。当我们洗碱夺苗时，有人说：“当年日本侵略者在这里种过水稻，还搬来了东京的水稻专家，结果是颗粒不收。现在要看看解放军怎么样？”同志们充满信心地说：“日本帝国主义是进行掠夺，自然不会捞到一根稻草。我们是在贯彻伟大领袖毛主席的‘五·七’指示，为革命种田，必然能夺得水稻丰收。”为了洗碱夺苗，战士们发扬勇敢战斗，不怕疲劳的作风，天不亮下地，夜深了才回来，把每天换两次水改为换四次水，终于把碱分从百分之一点八九降到百分之零点二一四，促使稻芽茁壮地钻出土层。
    听到茫茫盐碱滩上长出幼苗的消息，科学研究所的同志来了。他们把幼苗看了又看，摸了又摸，连声赞叹：“不简单，不简单！”临走时关心地提醒我们：“见苗三分喜，但是还有七分愁。要特别注意夏天翻碱这一关。”看看他们的表情，听听他们的建议，我们既高兴，又担心。高兴的是：盐碱滩上长出的幼苗，开始帮助这几位搞科学研究的同志冲破了洋框框；担心的是：幼苗能不能闯过夏天翻碱关！
    六月底，烈日当空，西南风不停地刮。上烤下蒸，盐碱上翻很厉害，一大片稻苗变黄了。几十里外的贫下中农弟兄为我们担心，有的跑来帮助我们想办法。但是，地富反坏分子却暗中高兴。他们嘲笑说：“解放军真行，有三八作风，稻子种的快，‘熟’的也快。”
    摆在我们面前的，不仅是能不能生产出水稻的问题，而且是能不能给阶级敌人当头一棒，能不能破除人民头脑里的旧思想，旧习惯。更为重要的是，能不能通过我们自身思想革命化和带来的物质成果，显示毛泽东思想的无比威力的问题。想到这里，同志们把稻田当战场，适时换水，拔净杂草，千方百计，精心管理，终于使稻苗由黄变青了。
    秋收时节，同志们的手脚被碱水泡得变了样，脚跟却站得更稳了；个个脸蛋晒黑了，心却炼得更红了。在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，我们终于叫盐碱滩长出了稻子，获得了亩产四百斤的好收成。
    喜讯传出，科学研究所里那几位一直关心我们种稻的同志，高兴地赶来了。他们激动地、又是带自我批评地说：“这是罕见的奇迹。你们这才是科学种田。过去我们只调查了土壤的碱性，却没有看到你们无限忠于毛主席的颗颗红心。”他们要我们谈谈盐碱滩上夺取水稻丰收的经验，战士们回答说，最根本的一条就是：一颗红心永远忠于毛主席，用毛泽东思想武装了人的头脑，就能改天换地。
