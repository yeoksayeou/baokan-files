The great leader Chairman Mao has summarized the experiences of revolutionary committees at various levels and recently pointed out with great wisdom: "The basic experiences of revolutionary committees are three: one is having representatives of revolutionary cadres, one is having representatives of the military, and one is having representatives of revolutionary masses, achieving the three-in-one combination of the revolution. Revolutionary committees should implement unified leadership, break down redundant administrative structures, streamline and reduce bureaucracy, and organize a revolutionary leadership team that is connected with the masses." This latest directive is a beacon for us to build revolutionary committees.

Revolutionary committees are the crystallization of the boundless flames of Mao Zedong Thought combined with the wisdom of hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses. They are a great innovation in human history and a shining embodiment of Chairman Mao's great thought on believing in and relying on the masses, believing in and relying on the People's Liberation Army, and believing in and relying on the majority of cadres. When this new thing, the revolutionary committee, first appeared on the eastern horizon, our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "Revolutionary committees are good." What makes revolutionary committees good? They are good because they are established according to Chairman Mao's directive of the three-in-one combination principle of revolutionary power. They are good because they are the fruit of the heroic struggle between the revolutionary vanguard of the proletariat, the broad revolutionary masses, and the People's Liberation Army against a handful of capitalist roaders within the party. They are good because they are the vigorous and powerful new things that have emerged in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They are good because they are more suitable for the needs of the socialist economic base and more suitable for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing capitalist restoration. In a word, the most fundamental point is to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought actively and well. The appearance of this new thing, the revolutionary committee, has extremely great significance and will have an extremely profound impact on the Chinese revolution and the world revolution.

To build good revolutionary committees at various levels, we must raise high the banner of revolutionary criticism and continue to fight resolutely against the handful of die-hard capitalist roaders within the party, traitors, spies, and ghosts and monsters in society. At the same time, we must also resolutely fight against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideologies reflected in our revolutionary ranks.

The revolutionary vanguard of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses must take Chairman Mao's latest directive as their weapon, strike hard at a handful of class enemies, and never allow their plots to succeed. With unyielding loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, we must never forget class struggle and unshakably carry the struggle between the two lines to the end, build good revolutionary committees at various levels, and firmly establish their revolutionary authority in the struggle.

    建设革命委员会的光辉灯塔
    伟大领袖毛主席总结了各级革命委员会的经验，最近英明指出：“革命委员会的基本经验有三条：一条是有革命干部的代表，一条是有军队的代表，一条是有革命群众的代表，实现了革命的三结合。革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”这一最新指示，是我们建设革命委员会的光辉灯塔。
    革命委员会，是光焰无际的毛泽东思想同亿万革命群众智慧相结合的结晶，是人类历史上的伟大创举，是毛主席关于要相信和依靠群众，相信和依靠人民解放军，相信和依靠干部的大多数这一伟大思想在组织上的光辉体现。当革命委员会这个新生事物刚刚出现在东方地平线上的时候，我们伟大领袖毛主席就指出：“革命委员会好”。革命委员会好在什么地方呢？好就好在它是按照毛主席指示的三结合原则建立的革命政权，好就好在它是无产阶级革命派、广大革命群众和人民解放军同党内一小撮走资派英勇奋战的胜利果实，好就好在它是无产阶级文化大革命中涌现出来的朝气勃勃的富有强大生命力的新生事物，好就好在它更加适应社会主义经济基础的需要，更加适应巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟的需要。千好万好，最根本的一条，是要活学活用、学好用好毛泽东思想。革命委员会这个新生事物的出现，具有极其伟大的意义，对中国革命和世界革命都将产生极其深远的影响。
    为了建设好各级革命委员会，我们必须更高地举起革命大批判的旗帜，继续同党内一小撮死不悔改的走资派，叛徒、特务，社会上的牛鬼蛇神作坚决的斗争，同时也必须同反映在我们革命队伍中的资产阶级、小资产阶级思想作坚决的斗争。
    无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，一定要以毛主席最新指示为武器，狠狠地打击一小撮阶级敌人，决不让他们的阴谋得逞。要以对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚，念念不忘阶级斗争，坚定不移地将两条路线斗争进行到底，建设好我们的各级革命委员会，并在斗争中牢固地树立它的革命权威。　《江西日报》
