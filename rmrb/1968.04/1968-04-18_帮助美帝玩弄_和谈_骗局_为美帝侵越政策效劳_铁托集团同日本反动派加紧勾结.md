The traitorous clique of Yugoslavia, headed by Tito, engaged in eight days of activities in Japan from April 8 to 15. They colluded closely with the pro-American, traitorous Japanese Prime Minister Sato Eisaku, striving to help the U.S. imperialists play the "peace talks" trick and serve the U.S. imperialists' policy of aggression in Vietnam.

According to reports, Tito held talks with Sato in Tokyo. During the talks, these two lackeys of the U.S. imperialists sang in unison, finally reaching a "consensus" and expressing their intention to "take joint action" to further promote the U.S. imperialist head Johnson's strategy of war and "peace," aiming to help the U.S. imperialists escape their unprecedented internal and external difficulties.

In their "joint communiqué," Tito and Sato also expressed their intention to "make further efforts" to promote the recent joint conspiracy of the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists to supposedly "prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons."

The conspiratorial activities of Tito and Sato further exposed their ugly faces as henchmen of the U.S. imperialists. However, no matter what tricks they play, they cannot help their master, the U.S. imperialists, escape their predicament. Under the fierce blows of the world revolutionary tide, the conspiracies of Johnson, Tito, Sato, and their ilk will end in miserable failure.

    帮助美帝玩弄“和谈”骗局　为美帝侵越政策效劳
    铁托集团同日本反动派加紧勾结
    据新华社东京十六日电　南斯拉夫叛徒集团头目铁托八日到十五日在日本进行了八天的活动，同日本亲美卖国首相佐藤荣作加紧勾结，竭力帮助美帝玩弄“和谈”骗局，为美帝的侵越政策效劳。
    据报道，铁托同佐藤在东京举行了会谈。在会谈中，这两个美帝走狗一唱一和，最后，“取得了一致意见”，表示要“采取共同行动”，来进一步推行美帝头子约翰逊的战、“和”反革命两手策略，企图帮助美帝摆脱空前未有的内外交困的窘境。
    铁托和佐藤在“联合公报”中还表示，要“进一步努力”为美帝和苏修最近合伙抛出的所谓“防止核扩散”的阴谋卖力。
    铁托和佐藤的阴谋活动，进一步暴露了他们充当美帝帮凶的丑恶嘴脸。但是，不管他们玩弄什么花招，都无法使其主子美帝逃脱难关。在世界人民革命浪潮的猛烈打击下，约翰逊、铁托、佐藤之流的阴谋诡计都将以惨败而告终。
