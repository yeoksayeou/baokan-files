The great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "further economize and make revolution" reached the machine repair cooperative in Wanquan County. The revolutionary cadres of the proletariat in this cooperative were inspired and their fighting spirit was high, launching a vigorous campaign to economize and make revolution. The old workers took the lead, implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and with their exemplary actions, educating the younger generation.

Old Workers Lead by Example

In the vigorous campaign to economize and make revolution, how many old workers couldn't sleep at night!

Late at night, the old worker Wen Bao in the shaping group tossed and turned in bed. The words from the evening study session, "further economize and make revolution" and "embezzlement and waste are grave crimes," kept echoing in his ears. But the waste in the shaping group was severe: grinding wheels were discarded before they were fully used, paint and kerosene were spilled everywhere. Thinking of these things, he silently examined himself before Chairman Mao: Chairman Mao, I have let you down!

The next morning, without even washing his face, Old Wen rushed to the warehouse door and picked up a slightly larger old grinding wheel, took it to the workshop, and started grinding plow points on the grinding wheel machine. The grinding wheel spun quickly, sparks flew, and it made a "sand-sand" sound. He thought: what a good grinding wheel, why was it discarded? Wen Bao, Wen Bao! It's all your fault. You are the group leader, the apprentices want to discard it, why didn't you stop them?

From then on, Wen Bao used old grinding wheels every day and never took a new one again. His exemplary actions inspired many young apprentices. They said, "Teacher Wen uses old ones, we can't always take new ones." But there were still some apprentices who were wasteful and didn't pay attention to saving. When Wen Bao found out, he patiently dissuaded them and seriously told them: "Chairman Mao calls on us to 'further economize and make revolution,' we must firmly carry it out. Discarding usable grinding wheels is a grave crime! It's discarding the glorious tradition of hard work and simplicity of our working class!" Under Wen Bao's influence and help, the young apprentices in the shaping group all started using old grinding wheels that could still be used. Now, saving grinding wheels has become a common practice in this small group.

Not Even a Small Piece of Coke Can Be Wasted

Regardless of the scorching heat or bitter cold, every day after work, there is always an old worker and two young workers by the iron smelting furnace, picking out pieces of coke from the slag. They are so patient that even if it's the size of a soybean, they would use a hammer to knock it out, afraid to waste even a bit.

"A piece of coke is like a grain of rice, a drop of oil, a piece of cloth, a sheet of paper. They are all the result of the hard work and sweat of the working people, and they are not easily obtained!" This is a sentence often said by the old worker Sun Zhiguang.

Sun Zhiguang grew up in a rural area since he was young, living a poor life. In the old society, his father drove a cart for the landlord, his mother was sick and couldn't go out, and the family had nothing to eat or burn. The teenager Sun Zhiguang would get up before dawn every day with the poor children in the village to pick up coal cinders in Zhangjiakou. Not to mention running more than fifty miles a day, he often suffered from the bullying of the reactionary Kuomintang. Sometimes, if he couldn't pick up coal cinders, the family couldn't cook. Once his uncle came, his mother borrowed two pints of rice, but there was nothing to burn, so she took apart the pillow on the kang and made a meal with buckwheat husks. Thinking of these things, how could Sun Zhiguang not cherish the coke!

After Chairman Mao's great instruction to "further economize and make revolution" was issued, Sun Zhiguang was so excited that he couldn't sleep for several nights. He thought, Chairman Mao's words are all in our hearts. In the old society, poor children couldn't even pick up a piece of coal cinder, and when there was nothing to burn, they even burned the pillow; Chairman Mao led the poor people to rise up and live a sweet life. My family has been burning coal all year round. If I don't listen to Chairman Mao's words, whose words should I listen to? So, he discussed with two other young workers and decided to pick out the coke from the slag for the public every day after work.

    永远保持工人阶级的俭朴本色
    ——河北省万全县机修社老工人勤俭节约的小故事
    伟大领袖毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大指示传到万全县机修社以后，这个社的无产阶级革命派精神振奋，斗志昂扬，掀起了轰轰烈烈的节约闹革命的热潮。老工人一马当先，贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，并以自己的模范行动，教育着年轻的一代。
    老工人言传身教
    在轰轰烈烈的节约闹革命的群众运动中，每天夜里有多少老工人睡不着觉啊！
    深夜，成型组老工人温宝在床上翻来复去，晚上开会学习的毛主席教导：“要进一步节约闹革命”和“贪污和浪费是极大的犯罪”，一直响在耳边；可是成型组的浪费是严重的：砂轮没磨完就扔了，油漆、煤油洒得遍地都是。想到这些，他暗暗地向毛主席检查：毛主席，我对不起您老人家！
    第二天一早，老温脸也没有洗，先跑到库房门口拣了一个大一点的旧砂轮，提到车间，上到砂轮机上磨起犁尖来。砂轮飞快地转动着，火花四溅，发出“沙—沙”的响声。他想：多好的砂轮啊，怎么就扔了，温宝呀，温宝！全是你的错误。你是组长，徒工要扔掉，为啥你不挡住呀？
    从这以后，温宝每天都用旧砂轮，再也没领过一个新的。他这种模范行动，启发了不少青年徒工。他们说，人家温师傅老用旧的，咱们也不能老领新的呀。可是也有个别的徒工，大手大脚，不注意节约，一不好使就想扔掉。温宝发现后，就耐心地劝阻，并且严肃地告诉他们：“毛主席号召咱们‘要进一步节约闹革命’，咱们就要坚决照办。扔掉能用的砂轮，就是极大的犯罪！就是扔掉了咱工人阶级艰苦朴素的光荣传统！”在温宝的带动帮助下，成型组的青年徒工都用起了还能用的旧砂轮。现在，节约砂轮，在这个小组已蔚然成风。
    一小块焦炭也不能浪费
    不管酷暑严寒，每天下班以后，在炼铁炉旁边总有一个老工人和两个青年工人，一块一块地拣着釉子里的焦炭。他们是那么耐心，就是黄豆粒大的，也要用锤子敲下来，生怕浪费一点。
    “一块焦炭和一粒粮、一滴油、一寸布、一张纸一样，都是劳动人民用辛勤劳动和汗水换来的，它来之不易啊！”这是老工人孙志贵常说的一句话。
    孙志贵从小就生长在农村，过着贫苦的生活。在旧社会，他父亲给地主赶车，母亲有病出不了门，家里吃没吃、烧没烧。十几岁的孙志贵每天天不亮，就和村里的穷孩子们到张家口拣煤核。一天来回跑五十多里路不说，还经常受着国民党反动派的欺凌。有时，拣不上煤核，家里便没法做饭。一次他舅舅来了，他娘借了二升米，没有烧的，就把炕上的枕头拆开，用荞麦皮做了一顿饭，想到这些，孙志贵怎么不爱惜焦炭啊！
    毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大指示下达以后，孙志贵激动得几夜难合眼。他想，毛主席的话，句句说在俺们工人的心坎上。在旧社会里，穷孩子连块煤核也不叫好好拣，没得烧把枕头都烧了；毛主席他老人家领导穷人翻了身，过上甜美的日子，俺家里成年烧的是煤。我不听毛主席的话，听谁的？于是，他和另外两个青年工人商量了一下，决定每天下班后为公家拣釉子里的焦炭。
