The Xiyang County Revolutionary Committee, on the occasion of its first anniversary, mobilized the broad revolutionary masses to review the work of the county revolutionary committee over the past year in accordance with Chairman Mao's latest instructions. This has enabled the county revolutionary committee to have a clearer and more specific goal for further revolutionization.

The Xiyang County Revolutionary Committee was established on April 8 last year. To better implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and to become a highly proletarianized and highly combatant command center that can lead the people of the entire county in the struggle against class enemies in the stormy waves of class struggle, the committee decided to thoroughly review its work in seizing and exercising power over the past year.

How to review? One method is for a few people to review in a small room, and another is to follow Chairman Mao's teaching that "state organs must rely on the masses" and let the masses review and summarize. The county revolutionary committee chose the latter method. They believed that the masses knew best how the county revolutionary committee had performed over the past year. From March 16 to April 6, they held various forms of Mao Zedong Thought study classes and held meetings with poor and lower-middle peasants and production team cadres to widely solicit the masses' opinions on the county revolutionary committee's work over the past year. They then compiled these opinions and summarized them in accordance with Chairman Mao's latest instructions to guide future work.

What are the advantages of using this "from the masses, to the masses" method to review work? They felt there were several points:

First, it enables the county revolutionary committee to have a clear understanding of the overall situation of class struggle. The proletarian revolutionary forces of Xiyang County won the power struggle in February last year and established the revolutionary committee in April. They have consistently implemented Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, achieving good results in revolutionary great alliance, revolutionary three-in-one combination, resuming classes and making revolution, and promoting production through revolution. The entire county has held more than ten thousand various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and the revolutionary big criticism has been continuously and deeply carried out from urban areas to rural areas. Last year, the county's agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. In the face of such a good situation, some people have developed a sense of complacency and peace. This mass review has sounded an alarm for these people. The many situations reflected by the masses have made them realize that the class enemies have not become docile because of the victory of the revolutionary people. In some places, class enemies are stirring, some are trying to reverse the verdict, some are using the banner of "rebellion" to attack revolutionary cadres who have come forward to lead spring plowing and production, and some are spreading anarchist thoughts, attempting to disintegrate the newly formed leading cadres and sabotage agricultural production to achieve their counter-revolutionary restoration goals. The masses' reflections have greatly helped the members of the revolutionary committee to correctly estimate the current class struggle situation and determine the future work direction. Everyone realized that any rightist tendency is dangerous, and it is necessary to strengthen the consciousness of class struggle, to firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle," to see clearly the situation of class struggle, to continuously launch attacks on class enemies, and to carry the revolution through to the end.

Second, it has conducted a mass review of past work, making the county revolutionary committee more confident in affirming what should be affirmed. Since its establishment, the Xiyang County Revolutionary Committee has focused on the fundamentals, vigorously promoting the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, rapidly spreading and resolutely implementing each of Chairman Mao's latest instructions; firmly grasping the class struggle as the key, leading the revolutionary masses to severely criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods that China's Khrushchev promoted in the countryside, such as "three selfs and one package," "four freedoms," and "material incentives"; resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's great instruction of "learning from Dazhai in agriculture," leading the masses to push the movement of learning from Dazhai to a new stage; and promoting the thought revolutionization and organizational revolutionization of the leading organs, initially streamlining the leading organs, strengthening the grassroots, and frequently participating in collective labor by cadres, which has brought the cadres closer to the masses. All of these have been well received by the masses. The masses believe that this is the fundamental difference between today's revolutionary committee and the old county committee and old county people's committee, which had their leadership usurped by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. They said: The newly born revolutionary committee is very good, it is good precisely in these aspects. The masses' reflections have made the county revolutionary committee clear that these aspects of work need to be further improved in the future.

Third, mobilizing the masses to review has greatly promoted the further revolutionization of the county revolutionary committee by criticizing the shortcomings and errors in past work.

Chairman Mao recently taught us: "The revolutionary committee should implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative organs, streamline and downsize, and organize a revolutionary leadership cadre that is connected with the masses." In this review, the masses, based on Chairman Mao's latest instruction, have put forward higher requirements for the county revolutionary committee. They pointed out that the revolutionization of the county revolutionary committee is still far from what Chairman Mao requires, some organs are still overlapping, and there are still too many personnel in the organs, and some people have not done enough in going deep into reality and connecting with the masses. The revolutionary masses' criticism has given the county revolutionary committee a great impetus. Based on Chairman Mao's great instruction of "being both an 'official' and a common person," they have decided to further reform the leading organs. The decision is to further streamline and downsize, and to draw a batch of people to set up several county-level forest farms, livestock farms, and farms; at the same time, those who remain in the organs will carry forward the spirit of self-reliance and striving for progress of Dazhai, take the initiative to build a fixed labor base, and strive to achieve self-sufficiency or semi-self-sufficiency in grain and vegetables within a few years; on the other hand, to further reform the world outlook of cadres, closely connect with the masses, in addition to further criticizing the revisionist thought of doing official business and being a lord promoted by China's Khrushchev, it is decided that in the future, the county-level organs will be led by leading cadres to organize all cadres to go to the production teams in batches to learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants, learn their boundless love for Chairman Mao, boundless love for Mao Zedong Thought, and boundless love for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, learn their clear stance in class struggle, learn their spirit of not fearing difficulties and striving for progress, and learn their excellent style of hard work and plain living. Recently, 30 cadres, led by two vice-chairmen of the county revolutionary committee, have gone to the commune to labor and study with the commune members.

    贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线
    领导人民不断地向阶级敌人进行斗争
    昔阳县革委会发动群众总结掌权经验
    对阶级斗争形势胸中有数，奋斗目标更加明确
    据新华社太原二十日电　山西省昔阳县革命委员会在成立一周年的时候，发动广大革命群众，按照毛主席的最新指示，检查县革命委员会一年来的工作，从而使县革命委员会今后进一步实现革命化，有了更明确、更具体的奋斗目标。
    昔阳县革委会是去年四月八日成立的。县革委会为了在今后能够更好地贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，使它在阶级斗争的大风大浪中成为能够领导全县人民向阶级敌人进行斗争的非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的指挥部，决定很好地总结一下过去一年来掌权、用权的工作。
    怎么总结呢？一种办法是少数人关在小房子里总结，另一种办法是按照毛主席关于“国家机关必须依靠人民群众”的教导，让群众来检查、总结。县革命委员会选择了后一种办法。他们认为，县革命委员会过去一年的工作做得怎样，群众最清楚。从三月十六日到四月六日，他们通过各地举办的毛泽东思想学习班和召开贫下中农座谈会、生产大队生产队干部座谈会等形式，广泛听取了群众对县革委会一年来工作的意见，然后再把意见集中起来，以毛主席的最新指示为纲，进行总结，通过总结指导今后的工作。
    用这样一种“从群众中来，到群众中去”的方法总结工作，有什么好处呢？他们体会有以下几条：
    一、能使县革命委员会对整个阶级斗争的形势胸中有数。昔阳县无产阶级革命派去年二月获得夺权斗争胜利，四月份成立革命委员会以来，坚持执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，革命大联合、革命三结合、复课闹革命、抓革命促生产，都搞得比较好。全县先后举办了一万多个各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，革命的大批判从城镇到农村持续地深入地开展。去年全县农、林、牧、副又取得了历史上空前的大丰收。在一片大好形势面前，有的人便产生了和平麻痹思想。这次群众性的总结，给这些人敲响了警钟。群众反映的许多情况，使他们看清了阶级敌人并没有因为革命人民的胜利而老实起来。有些地方的阶级敌人正在蠢蠢欲动，有的妄图翻案，有的打着“造反”的旗号，打击站出来领导春耕生产的革命干部，有的散布无政府主义思想，妄图瓦解新产生的领导班子，破坏农业生产，达到他们实现反革命复辟的目的。群众的反映，对革委会成员正确估计当前的阶级斗争形势，确定今后的工作方针，给了很大的帮助。大家认识到，任何一点右倾思想都是危险的，必须加强阶级斗争观念，必须牢记毛主席的“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，看清阶级斗争的形势，不断地向阶级敌人发起进攻，将革命进行到底。
    二、把过去的工作进行了一次群众性的鉴定，使县革委会对过去工作中那些该肯定的，肯定得更有把握。昔阳县革命委员会成立以来，千头万绪抓根本，狠抓活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，迅速传播、坚决贯彻毛主席的每一项最新指示；紧紧抓住阶级斗争这个纲，领导革命群众，狠狠批判了中国赫鲁晓夫在农村推行的“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“物质刺激”等反革命修正主义黑货；坚决执行毛主席的“农业学大寨”的伟大指示，领导群众把学大寨的运动推进到一个新阶段；还抓了领导机关的思想革命化和组织革命化，初步精简了领导机构，充实了基层，干部经常参加集体劳动，密切了干群关系。所有这一些，群众都很满意。群众认为，这就是今天的革命委员会同过去被党内一小撮走资派篡夺了领导权的旧县委、旧县人委之间的根本区别。他们说：新生的革命委员会好得很，就是好得很，好就好在这些方面。群众的反映，使县革委会明确了今后要进一步把这些方面的工作做好。
    三、发动群众来总结，群众对过去工作中的缺点、错误提出批评，对县革委会今后进一步实现革命化是一个很大的推动。
    毛主席最近教导我们：“革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”在这次总结中，群众根据毛主席的这个最新指示，对县革委会提出了更高的要求。他们指出，现在县革委会的革命化离毛主席所要求的还有相当大的距离，有些机构仍然重叠，机关人员还是多，有的人深入实际、联系群众做得不够。革命群众的批评，给了县革委会一个很大的推动。他们根据毛主席关于“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的伟大指示，作出了进一步改革领导机关的决定。决定一方面要进一步精兵简政，再抽一批人兴办几个县营的林场、牧场和农场；同时留在机关的人，发扬大寨自力更生、奋发图强的精神，自己动手，建立固定性的劳动基地，力争在几年内实现粮、菜自给或半自给；另一方面，为了进一步改造干部的世界观，紧密联系群众，除进一步批判中国赫鲁晓夫宣扬的做官当老爷的修正主义思想以外，决定今后县级机关由领导干部带队，组织全体干部分期分批到生产队去，拜贫下中农为师，学习他们无限热爱毛主席，无限热爱毛泽东思想，无限热爱毛主席无产阶级革命路线的深厚的无产阶级感情，学习他们在阶级斗争中爱憎分明的立场，学习他们不怕困难、奋发图强的革命精神和艰苦朴素的优良作风。最近，已有三十名干部由县革委会两名副主任率领，到公社去同社员一起劳动、学习。
