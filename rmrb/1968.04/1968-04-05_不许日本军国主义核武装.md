With the support of U.S. imperialism, the Sato government of Japan is hurriedly expanding its military and preparing for war, actively seeking nuclear armament. This is a serious step taken by the resurgent Japanese militarists in their reckless plans for external aggression and their delusional ambitions to dominate Asia once again.

The Japanese reactionary ruling clique has long harbored ambitions to obtain nuclear weapons and achieve nuclear armament. In recent years, especially after Sato's "visit" to the United States last November, the Japanese militarists have accelerated their nuclear armament efforts. They openly advocate for the "elimination" of the Japanese people's "nervousness" about nuclear weapons, promoting the idea that Japan "should establish a certain degree of preemptive strike capability," such as possessing nuclear equipment. To obtain more nuclear materials and master nuclear technology in preparation for producing nuclear weapons, in February of this year, the Sato government of Japan signed a new "U.S.-Japan Atomic Energy Cooperation Agreement" with the United States. U.S.-Japanese monopolistic capitalists also agreed to jointly exploit Canadian uranium mines. These facts indicate that the Japanese reactionaries have embarked on the path of developing nuclear weapons.

The Sato government, to cover up its nuclear armament activities, advocates the so-called "three non-nuclear principles" (that is, not to manufacture, possess, or allow the entry of nuclear weapons). This is nothing but a facade. In reality, the Sato government has already placed Japan under the U.S. "nuclear umbrella," turning Japan into a U.S. nuclear base. It allows U.S. nuclear-armed warships to freely enter and leave Japanese ports. It also plots to equip the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" with U.S. nuclear weapons. According to revelations by Japanese Socialist Party members, the Sato government is researching the production of missile warheads according to Japan's third military expansion plan. In recent times, the Japanese reactionaries have been vigorously promoting the idea of "reclaiming Okinawa" while retaining U.S. nuclear bases, which is merely an attempt to "legalize" the crime of the U.S. imperialists openly bringing nuclear weapons into Japanese territory. Wanting to openly bring in nuclear weapons and secretly manufacture nuclear weapons, the so-called "three non-nuclear principles" of the Sato clique are nothing but sheer lies!

The Japanese reactionaries also claim that they are not pursuing nuclear armament but "peaceful use of nuclear energy." However, even Japanese bourgeois newspapers do not hide the fact that the so-called "peaceful use" ultimately "links up with military use." It is common knowledge that nuclear fuel can be processed for military purposes. The Japanese militarists' attempt to use "peaceful use" as a cover is fooling no one.

To develop nuclear weapons and serve U.S. imperialism, the Sato clique spreads smoke screens, shouting about the need to "counter" China's "nuclear threat." This is nothing but a despicable trick of the thief crying "stop thief." The Chinese people's development of nuclear weapons is purely for self-defense. The Chinese government has repeatedly declared that it will not be the first to use nuclear weapons. The Japanese people see clearly that the nuclear threat to Japan comes entirely from U.S. imperialism.

The first to use atomic weapons to massacre the Japanese people was U.S. imperialism. The one that has set up military bases all over Japan and brought nuclear weapons onto Japanese soil is U.S. imperialism. The one that oppresses the Japanese nation and waves nuclear weapons at the Japanese people is still U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialism is the mortal enemy of the Japanese people. The Sato clique's shouting about China's "nuclear threat" only further exposes its treacherous nature of betraying the interests of the Japanese nation, opposing the Asian people, and acting as a henchman of U.S. imperialism.

The evil intentions of the Japanese reactionaries in frantically developing nuclear weapons and pursuing nuclear armament are clear. This is to use nuclear weapons as a backing and rely on U.S. imperialism to launch external aggression and expansion, and to suppress the revolutionary movements of the Asian people. However, the Japanese reactionaries' wishful thinking is doomed to fail. U.S. imperialism has already armed itself to the teeth with nuclear weapons and has been beaten to a pulp by the people of the world, in a sorry state. How much more so for the Japanese reactionaries? The Japanese reactionaries' insistence on nuclear armament and serving U.S. imperialism's "nuclear strategy" will only bring extremely serious disasters to the Japanese nation. This is something the Japanese people will absolutely not accept.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "The atomic bomb is a paper tiger used by the U.S. reactionaries to scare people." "The people are the decisive factor. Relying on the unity and struggle of the people, we must be able to defeat imperialism and its running dogs."

Today, the Japanese people are more awakened than ever, and they are bravely fighting against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. They firmly oppose Japan's nuclear armament and firmly oppose the Japanese militarists tying Japan to the U.S. imperialist war chariot and becoming sacrificial lambs. Today, the situation in Asia and the world has undergone earth-shaking changes in favor of the people. We warn the Japanese reactionaries: Following U.S. imperialism and pursuing nuclear armament, taking the path of Tojo Hideki and his ilk, you will inevitably face severe punishment from the Asian people and the people of the world, accelerating your own doom!

    不许日本军国主义核武装
    本报评论员
    在美帝国主义的支持下，日本佐藤政府正在加紧扩军备战，积极进行核武装。这是正在复活的日本军国主义势力猖狂策划对外侵略、妄图重新称霸亚洲的严重步骤。
    日本反动统治集团早就野心勃勃，想要染指核武器，实行核武装。最近几年，特别是去年十一月佐藤
  “访问”美国之后，日本军国主义者加快了核武装的步伐。他们公然叫嚷要“消除”日本国民“对核的神经质”，鼓吹日本“应该建立能够进行某种程度的先发制人的进攻力量”，“例如拥有核装备”等等。为了取得更大量的核原料和掌握核技术，为生产核武器作准备，今年二月，日本佐藤政府同美国签订了新的“美日原子能合作协定”。美日垄断资本还议定共同开采加拿大的铀矿。种种事实表明，日本反动派已经走上发展核武器的道路。
    佐藤政府为了遮掩它的核武装活动，标榜什么日本实行“无核三原则”（即所谓不制造、不持有、不运进核武器）。这完全是一个幌子。事实上，佐藤政府早就把日本置于美国的“核保护伞”之下，把日本变成美国的核基地。它让装有核武器的美国核舰艇自由进出日本港口。它还阴谋用美国核武器装备日本“自卫队”。根据日本社会党议员的揭露，佐藤政府正在依照日本第三次扩军计划，研究制造装核弹头的导弹。最近一个时期以来，日本反动派大肆宣传在保留美国核基地的情况下“收回冲绳”，这不过是为了使美帝国主义公开向日本领土运进核武器的罪行“合法化”而已。既要公开运进核武器，还想偷偷制造核武器，佐藤之流的所谓“无核三原则”，岂不是不折不扣的鬼话！
    日本反动派还说什么，他们不是搞核武装，而是搞“核和平利用”。然而，就连日本资产阶级报纸也不讳言，所谓“和平利用”，“结果还是与军事利用联系起来”。核燃料可以被加工用于军事方面，这是普通常识。日本军国主义者想用什么“和平利用”来打马虎眼，是骗不了人的。
    为了发展核武器，替美帝国主义效劳，佐藤之流大放烟幕，叫嚷什么要“对付”中国的“核威胁”。这更是贼喊捉贼的卑鄙伎俩。中国人民发展核武器，完全是为了自卫，中国政府早已一再声明不首先使用核武器。日本人民看得很清楚，对日本的核威胁完全是来自美帝国主义。
    第一次使用原子武器屠杀日本人民的是美帝国主义。在日本遍设军事基地并且把核武器搬到日本领土上的，是美帝国主义。压迫日本民族，向日本人民挥舞核武器的，还是美帝国主义。美帝国主义是日本人民不共戴天的死敌。佐藤之流叫嚣中国的“核威胁”，只能更充分地暴露出它出卖日本民族利益、敌视亚洲人民、充当美帝国主义帮凶的嘴脸。
    日本反动派疯狂地发展核武器，进行核武装的罪恶目的是昭然若揭的。这就是妄图以核武器为后盾，以美帝国主义为靠山，向外进行侵略和扩张，镇压亚洲人民的革命运动。但是，日本反动派的这个如意算盘是注定要破产的。美帝国主义早就用核武器武装到牙齿，尚且被全世界人民打得头破血流，狼狈不堪，何况日本反动派呢？日本反动派一意孤行地搞核武装，为美帝国主义的“核战略”效劳，到头来只能给日本民族带来极其严重的灾难。这是日本人民绝对不答应的。
    我们伟大的导师毛主席早就指出：“原子弹是美国反动派用来吓人的一只纸老虎”。“人民是决定的因素，依靠人民的团结和斗争，必能战胜帝国主义和他们的走狗”。
    今天，日本人民正在空前觉醒，他们为反对美帝国主义及其走狗进行着英勇的斗争。他们坚决反对日本进行核武装，坚决反对日本军国主义者把日本捆在美帝国主义的战车上，充当牺牲品。今天，整个亚洲和世界的形势也发生了有利于人民的翻天覆地的大变化。我们要警告日本反动派：你们追随美帝国主义，实行核武装，走东条英机之流的老路，必将受到亚洲人民和全世界人民的严厉的惩罚，加速你们自己的灭亡！
