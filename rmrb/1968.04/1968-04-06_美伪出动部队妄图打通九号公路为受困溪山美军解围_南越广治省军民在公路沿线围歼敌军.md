U.S. and Puppet Troops Attempt to Reopen Route 9 to Relieve Besieged U.S. Troops in Khe Sanh
People of Quang Tri Province in South Vietnam Annihilate Enemy Forces Along the Road

HANOI, April 5 (Xinhua) — The people's liberation armed forces in Quang Tri Province, South Vietnam, have been fiercely intercepting U.S. and puppet troops along Route 9 in recent days, annihilating a large number of enemy forces. The U.S. aggressors' attempt to relieve the besieged U.S. Marine Corps in the Khe Sanh area and their plan to reopen Route 9 have been thwarted from the outset.

According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, on April 3, the U.S. aggressors dispatched a battalion from the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division to the Da Nang base, attempting to rescue several thousand U.S. aggressors besieged by the people's liberation armed forces at this base. As soon as the enemy forces reached the Ban Keo and Ban Kiet areas, about five kilometers southeast of the Da Nang base, they were immediately subjected to fierce interception by the people's liberation armed forces. After several hours of intense battle, the people's liberation armed forces repelled the enemy's seven counterattacks, annihilating more than 70 enemy forces and shooting down two helicopters.

On the same day, the artillery units of the people's liberation armed forces also used fierce artillery fire to attack a company of U.S. Marines rushing out from the southwest of the Da Nang base and a unit of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division that had reached the Ma Trai area, about seven kilometers southeast of the Da Nang base, annihilating more than 70 U.S. troops.

On the morning of April 4, a battalion of U.S. and puppet troops rushed out from the southwest of the Da Nang base, attempting to make contact with the units of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division. They were immediately met with a fierce counterattack by the infantry and artillery of the people's liberation armed forces. The U.S. aggressors hastily dispatched helicopters to airlift reinforcements. But this batch of reinforcements was also beaten back by the liberation army soldiers. As a result, more than 150 enemy forces were annihilated, most of whom were U.S. aggressors.

On April 3, the people's liberation armed forces also intercepted a battalion of U.S. and puppet troops that were "sweeping" in the Dong Ha area northwest of Dong Ha, annihilating nearly 40 enemy forces, destroying five tanks and armored vehicles, and shooting down one helicopter.

The Command of the People's Liberation Armed Forces in the Khe Sanh Battlefield of Quang Tri Province, South Vietnam, sent a telegram praising the outstanding achievements of the liberation army units in the Ban Keo and Ban Kiet areas on April 3, and encouraged them to continue to carry forward the spirit of active offense and achieve even greater victories.

According to another report from the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, on March 30 and 31, the people's liberation armed forces consecutively intercepted the enemy forces invading the Yu Ling County, annihilating more than 260 U.S. and puppet troops, shooting down three helicopters, and destroying four tanks and armored vehicles.

On March 30, 31, and April 1, the people's liberation armed forces intercepted the enemy in the Lim Xuan area, seven kilometers southeast of Yut Liem, annihilating 380 U.S. aggressors, destroying and damaging ten tanks and armored vehicles, and shooting down two helicopters.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on April 4, the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency reported: In recent days, the people and military in South Vietnam have continued to attack U.S. and puppet troops on various battlefields, achieving many victories.

The people's liberation armed forces in Quang Ngai Province launched consecutive attacks on the towns of Tra Bong and Go Dau on March 25 and 26, annihilating four companies of enemy forces, including three companies of U.S. aggressors and hundreds of puppet "pacification" personnel, severely damaging two security companies of puppet troops, destroying nearly 50 tanks and armored vehicles, shooting down four aircraft, and seizing a large amount of weapons and military supplies. The people's liberation armed forces in Quang Tri Province launched consecutive attacks on the enemy in the Da Nang area near Khe Sanh from March 28 to 31, annihilating more than 330 U.S. aggressors, shooting down and damaging five aircraft, and seizing a large amount of military supplies.

The people's liberation armed forces in Ninh Thuan Province launched attacks on the "strategic hamlet" of Chi Linh, southwest of the provincial capital Phan Rang, on March 28 and 29, annihilating more than 100 enemy forces.

The people's liberation armed forces in the Thua Thien-Hue region launched an attack on the U.S. military base in the southwest of Hue City on March 27. After 20 minutes of heroic battle, they completely controlled the position, annihilating an entire company of U.S. troops. On the same day, the people's liberation armed forces also annihilated more than 100 enemy forces in the Binh Dinh and Truc Xa areas southwest of Hue City, destroying two tanks, and shooting down one aircraft. On March 28 and 29, the people's liberation armed forces continued to pursue the enemy in this region, annihilating nearly 100 U.S. troops, shooting down five aircraft, and capturing two pilots.

The people's liberation armed forces in Thua Thien Province consecutively intercepted the enemy forces conducting "sweeping" operations in Chau Thanh County from March 26 to 28, annihilating nearly 200 enemy forces, damaging multiple helicopters, and sinking three warships.

The people's liberation armed forces in Can Tho Province ambushed an enemy convoy traveling from Chau Doc to Can Tho City on Route 4 on March 26. After a ten-minute battle, they destroyed and damaged 15 enemy vehicles, annihilating nearly 50 enemy forces. (Photo attached)
