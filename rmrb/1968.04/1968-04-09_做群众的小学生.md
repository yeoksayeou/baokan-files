	To properly address the relationship between superiors and subordinates, and to foster a good relationship between cadres and the masses, cadres should go down to the grassroots, observe, and adhere to the mass line. They should consult with the masses on matters and be students of the masses. In a certain sense, the most intelligent and talented are those with the most practical experience.

	Editor's Note: Recently, our great teacher Chairman Mao instructed us: "The most fundamental aspect of reforming state organs is to connect with the masses."

	We revolutionary cadres, regardless of our positions, are servants of the people. To be good servants of the people, we must always maintain the demeanor of ordinary laborers, immerse ourselves among the masses, blend with them, and humbly accept the masses' supervision. Only then can we continuously promote the revolutionization of our thoughts, maintain a humble and prudent attitude, prevent the growth of bureaucratism, guard against degeneration, and always follow Chairman Mao in the revolution.

	To be good servants of the people, we must adhere to the mass line, consult with the masses on matters, rely on the wisdom and strength of the masses to complete various revolutionary tasks.

	The following are the reflections of comrades from the military on studying Chairman Mao's teachings about closely connecting with the masses. Many of their experiences are personal, but they have universal significance.

	Be a Student of the Masses

	Naval Aviation Corps Office, Hong Haiying

	Chairman Mao has always taught us: "Communist Party members must never detach themselves from the masses, never stand above the masses, act like officials and lords, but should appear before the masses as ordinary laborers, immerse themselves among the masses, and blend with them." However, the Chinese Khrushchev wants Party members to stand above the masses, act like officials and lords, and arbitrarily manipulate the masses. In his own words, "I tell them how to organize, how to struggle. After the struggle is won, everyone applauds, thinking I have helped them, placing the credit on me alone. Because once you leave, they will be in trouble, and others can't do your job." Look! This is a portrait of a bourgeois official and lord he painted for himself. In his eyes, the masses are merely submissive and helpless "fools" who would be in trouble and unable to live without him. Only he is the "savior." The Chinese Khrushchev is of the same ilk as all reactionary politicians in history who view the masses as "mob."

	The mass line is a fundamental principle of Marxism-Leninism. The attitude towards the masses is the dividing line and touchstone between true revolutionaries and false revolutionaries, revolutionaries and counter-revolutionaries, Marxists and revisionists; it is a major issue concerning whether one can be loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Our great leader Chairman Mao is the greatest and most brilliant example of correctly treating revolutionary masses. He believes in the masses the most, cares for the masses the most, supports the revolutionary movements of the masses the most, and is heart-to-heart with the masses. He teaches us: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history." Recently, he also instructed us: "In a certain sense, the most intelligent and talented are those with the most practical experience."

	Chairman Mao's great theory and practice on treating revolutionary mass movements are forever our shining examples to learn from.

	We Communist Party members are servants of the people, ordinary laborers. In mass movements, we should regard ourselves as friends of the masses, students of the masses, let the masses help us in our revolution, fight alongside the masses, and advance with the masses, rather than being their superiors or bureaucratic politicians. We should often go among the masses, get close to them, always share the same breath, the same fate, blend with the masses, maintain the demeanor of an ordinary soldier, continuously accept education from the masses, gain enlightenment and help, promote the revolutionization of our thoughts, and make our style of work combat-ready. If we detach ourselves from the masses, we cannot share the same thoughts, feelings, language, and actions with the masses, cannot be heart-to-heart with the masses, and will deviate from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: Communist Party members are not to seek official positions but to make revolution. Seeking official positions or being servants of the people are two fundamentally opposed worldviews, a dividing line between true and false revolutionaries. Practice has proven that having an official mindset will lead to arrogance towards the masses, fostering bureaucratism, gradually turning oneself into a lord above the masses. We must go among the masses, criticize and repudiate our selfishness and revisionism, eliminate official mindset, smash the bourgeois idea of seeking official positions and acting like lords, and firmly establish a worldview of selflessly serving the people and the revolution.

	The people are the motive force in the making of world history. The masses are filled with boundless revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity. It is the great people who, with their labor and wisdom, created human civilization. It is the great people who, with their brave resistance against reactionary ruling classes, promoted social progress. Countless facts prove: as long as we closely rely on the masses, we can overcome all difficulties, defeat all enemies, and accomplish all tasks. Conversely, if we detach ourselves from the people, we will become like a tree without roots, a river without a source, and achieve nothing. Every Communist Party member, every true revolutionary, should support the revolutionary mass movements with the greatest enthusiasm, should honestly regard the masses as teachers, humbly learn from the masses, and forever be students of the masses.

	Towards certain backward thoughts among the masses, our correct attitude should be to "patiently and persistently educate them, help them shed their burdens, struggle against their shortcomings and mistakes, so that they can advance in big strides." We should not look down upon or despise them. As long as we skillfully guide the masses to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, let the masses revolutionize themselves, educate themselves, and liberate themselves, they can certainly advance in big strides under the invincible guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

	If, like the Chinese Khrushchev, one always thinks oneself superior to others, not placing oneself among the masses to accept their supervision, but standing above the masses, acting like an official and lord, issuing orders and commands, then one can only damage the relationship between Party members and the masses, disintegrate the revolutionary ranks, and ultimately fall.

	We must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings to go among the masses and be with them, always blend with the masses, and with the demeanor of an ordinary worker, peasant, student, or office worker, move among the masses, be a faithful servant of the people.

专栏：

    要很好地解决上下级关系问题，搞好干部和群众的关系。以后干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。		毛泽东
    编者按：伟大导师毛主席最近教导我们：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”
    我们广大革命干部，不管在什么工作岗位上，都是人民的勤务员。要当好人民的勤务员，就要永远保持普通劳动者的本色，深入于群众之中，和群众打成一片，甘当群众的小学生，并且虚心接受群众的监督。这样，才能不断促进思想革命化，保持谦虚谨慎的作风，防止官僚主义的滋长，防止蜕化变质，永远紧跟毛主席干革命。
    要当好人民的勤务员，就要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，依靠群众的智慧和力量，去完成各项革命任务。
    这里发表的，是部队同志学习毛主席关于密切联系群众的教导的一些心得体会。他们谈的很多是自己的亲身经历，但有一定的普遍意义。
    做群众的小学生
    海军航空兵机关　红海鹰
    毛主席历来教导我们：“共产党员绝不可脱离群众，绝不可高踞于群众之上，做官当老爷，而应当以普通劳动者的姿态，出现在群众面前，深入于群众之中，同群众打成一片。”可是，中国赫鲁晓夫却要党员高踞于群众之上，做官当老爷，任意摆布群众。用他自己的话说，就是我“告诉他们怎样组织，怎样斗争，斗争胜利了，大家都鼓掌，以为我帮了他们忙，把功劳放在我一个人身上。因为你一走，他们就要糟糕，你的事情别人干不了。”瞧！这是给他自己描绘的一幅资产阶级官老爷的画像。在他眼里，群众只不过是俯首帖耳、离开了他
  “就要糟糕”、就活不下去的“阿斗”，只有他自己才是“救世主”。中国赫鲁晓夫同历史上一切视群众为“群氓”的反动阶级政客完全是一路货色！
    群众观点是马克思列宁主义的一个根本观点。对待群众采取什么态度，是真革命和假革命、反革命，马克思主义和修正主义的分水岭和试金石；是关系到能不能忠于毛主席革命路线的重大问题。伟大领袖毛主席是正确对待革命群众最伟大最光辉的典范。他老人家最相信群众，最关心群众，最支持群众的革命运动，和群众心连心。他教导我们：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”最近他又指示我们：“在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”
    毛主席对待革命群众运动的伟大理论和伟大实践，永远是我们学习的光辉榜样。
    我们共产党员是人民群众的勤务员，是普通劳动者。在群众运动中，应该把自己看作是群众的朋友，群众的小学生，让群众帮助自己革命，和群众战斗在一起，前进在一起，而不能是群众的上司、官僚主义的政客。我们要经常到群众中去，接近群众，永远和群众同呼吸，共命运，和群众打成一片，保持普通一兵的本色，不断地从群众那里接受教育，得到启发、帮助，促进自己思想革命化，作风战斗化。我们如果脱离群众，就不能和群众有共同的思想，共同的感情，共同的语言，共同的行动，就不能和群众心连心，发展下去，就会背离毛主席的革命路线。
    毛主席教导我们：共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命。是做官还是当人民的勤务员，这是两种根本对立的世界观，是真革命还是假革命的分水岭。事实证明，有了官气，就会对群众摆臭架子，滋长官僚主义作风，逐渐使自己变成高踞于群众之上的官老爷。我们一定要到群众中去，斗私批修，打掉官气，大破资产阶级当官做老爷的思想，大立当人民勤务员的思想，牢固地树立一心为公，一心为革命的共产主义世界观。
    人民群众是创造世界历史的动力。群众中蕴藏着无穷无尽的革命积极性和创造力。正是伟大的人民群众，用自己的劳动和智慧，创造了人类的文明。正是伟大的人民群众，用他们对反动统治阶级的英勇反抗，推动了社会的进步。无数的事实证明：只要我们紧紧地依靠群众，我们就能克服一切困难，战胜一切敌人，做好一切工作。反之，脱离人民群众，我们就会变成无源之水，无本之木，我们就一事无成。每一个共产党员，每一个真正的革命者，都应当以最大的热情支持革命的群众运动，都应该老老实实地拜群众为师，虚心向群众学习，永远做群众的小学生。
    对群众中的某些落后思想，我们正确的态度应该是“长期地耐心地教育他们，帮助他们摆脱背上的包袱，同自己的缺点错误作斗争，使他们能够大踏步地前进。”而不能轻视他们，看不起他们。只要善于引导群众活学活用毛主席著作，让群众自己起来革命，自己教育自己，自己解放自己，他们完全可以在战无不胜的毛泽东思想照耀下，大踏步前进的。
    如果象中国赫鲁晓夫那样，总以为自己比别人高明，超人一等，不是把自己放在群众之中，接受群众的监督，而是站在群众之上，做官当老爷，指手划脚，发号施令，那么，就只能破坏党员和群众的关系，瓦解革命队伍，自己也必然垮台。
    我们一定牢记毛主席到群众里面去，和群众在一起的教导，永远和群众打成一片，完全以一个普通工人、社员、学生、机关工作人员的姿态，来往于群众之中，做一个忠实的人民勤务员。
