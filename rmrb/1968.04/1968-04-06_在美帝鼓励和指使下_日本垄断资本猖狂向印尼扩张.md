Tokyo, April 6 (Xinhua) - The reactionary Sato government of Japan, under the instruction of U.S. imperialism, is brazenly expanding its economic influence into Indonesia. Its ambition towards Indonesia is becoming increasingly blatant.

According to a recent report by the Japanese bourgeois newspaper "Economic News," the Sato government decided at last month's vice-ministerial meeting to provide more "aid" to the fascist military regime in Indonesia at "low interest rates." According to "Economic News," the Sato government originally planned to provide a loan of $60 million to the fascist military regime in Indonesia this fiscal year. However, due to the visit of the head of the Indonesian fascist military regime, Suharto, to Japan at the end of March to beg for "aid," the Sato government is prepared to increase the "aid" to Indonesia to $90 million.

Since the U.S. imperialists' faithful lackey, the Indonesian fascist military clique, seized power, the Japanese reactionaries have provided a large amount of "aid" to this reactionary regime. In 1966, they provided $32.5 million in "grant aid" and "yen loans"; in 1967, this amount reached $60 million (this figure even exceeded the "aid" amounts from the U.S., Britain, West Germany, and the Netherlands).

After the meeting between the U.S. imperialist leader Johnson and Japanese Prime Minister Sato in November 1967, Japanese monopoly capitalists decided to make Indonesia a key target for their economic expansion. They specifically established an "Indonesia Committee" within their headquarters, the "Federation of Economic Organizations," to study plans for strengthening economic expansion into Indonesia.

Japanese monopoly capitalists have long harbored ambitions for Indonesia's important industrial raw materials such as oil, nickel, tin, and copper. In recent years, as the Japanese reactionaries increased their "aid" to the Indonesian reactionaries, Japanese monopoly capitalists' influence has penetrated various parts of Indonesia.

To further plunder Indonesia's natural resources, the capital of the Kyushu Oil Development Company of Japan will increase from 1.8 billion yen to 5 billion yen. The Japanese reactionary government also decided to allocate a large sum of "oil development funds." On February 20 of this year, 23 major enterprises of Japanese monopoly capitalists such as Mitsubishi and Mitsui established the "International Agricultural Development Company." One of its tasks is to plunder the rich resources of Sumatra Island in Indonesia.

    在美帝鼓励和指使下
    日本垄断资本猖狂向印尼扩张
    据新华社讯　东京消息：日本佐藤反动政府在美帝国主义指使下正在猖狂地向印度尼西亚进行经济扩张。它对印尼的野心越来越露骨。
    据日本资产阶级报纸《经济新闻》最近报道，佐藤政府在上月举行的次官会议（副部长会议）上，决定要以“低利息”向印尼法西斯军人政权提供更多的“援助”。据《经济新闻》透露，佐藤政府原定在今年度向印尼法西斯军人政权提供六千万美元的贷款，但是，由于三月底印尼法西斯军人政权的头目苏哈托到日本来乞求“援助”，因此，佐藤政府准备把对印尼的“援助”额提高到九千万美元。
    自从美帝国主义的忠实走卒印尼法西斯军人集团篡夺政权以来，日本反动派向这个反动政权提供了大量的“援助”，一九六六年提供的“无偿援助”和“日元贷款”共合三千二百五十万美元；一九六七年达六千万美元（这个数字甚至超过了美、英、西德、荷兰的“援助”额）。
    在一九六七年十一月美帝头子约翰逊和日本首相佐藤会谈后，日本垄断资本已经决定把印尼作为它的经济扩张的重点。它已经特意在它的司令部“经济团体联合会”内部成立了“印尼委员会”，负责研究加强对印尼进行经济扩张的计划。
    日本垄断资本对印尼的重要工业原料石油、镍、锡、铜等一向野心勃勃。几年来随着日本反动派对印尼反动派的“援助”额的增加，日本垄断资本的势力渗入印尼各地。
    为了进一步掠夺印尼的自然资源，日本的九州石油开发公司的资本将从十八亿日元增加到五十亿日元。日本反动政府还决定拨出一大笔石油“开发资金”，日本的三菱、三井等垄断资本的二十三家大企业，今年二月二十日成立了“国际农业开发公司”，它的任务之一就是掠夺印尼苏门答腊岛上的丰富资源。
