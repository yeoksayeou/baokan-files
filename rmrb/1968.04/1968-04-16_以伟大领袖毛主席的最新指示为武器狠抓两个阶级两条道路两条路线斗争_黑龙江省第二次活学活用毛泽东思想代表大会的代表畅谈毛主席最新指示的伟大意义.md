The brilliant new instructions from Chairman Mao have greatly inspired and educated the representatives attending the Second Conference on Studying and Applying Chairman Mao Zedong's Thought in Heilongjiang Province. They discussed the great significance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions in connection with the province's more than a year of struggle in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The representatives excitedly said: The great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions most profoundly elucidate the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, most penetratingly reveal the class content of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and are a new battle cry to inspire hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses to achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They are a sharp weapon for launching a proactive attack on the class enemy. We must study them seriously and understand them deeply.

Li Zhiguang, deputy head of the Yichun Municipal Revolutionary Committee, said: Our Party and the reactionary Kuomintang have been fighting for decades. Before the founding of New China, under the leadership of our Party, the broad revolutionary masses, through armed struggle, overthrew the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and seized power. After liberation, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, led by Liu Shaoqi, represented the interests of the Kuomintang reactionaries, that is, the bourgeoisie and landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and attempted to restore capitalism in China. This bunch is our most dangerous enemy.

Famous labor model and Party branch secretary of Taiping Brigade in Gannan County, Lü He, said: The history of our brigade's development over the past decade on the cooperative path is a history of the struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads. The class enemies who occupied the leadership positions of the county and commune, under the protection of Liu Shaoqi's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, once colluded and conspired together, forcing us to divide the public accumulation, "distribute" collective livestock to households, and dismantle the collective economy. We relied on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to resist this "three-self and one-package" black wind. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we poor and lower-middle peasants dragged out these bastards and found out that some of them were landlords who had been wrongly classified, and some were traitors who had surrendered to the enemy. The complex class struggle educated us and made us deeply realize the unparalleled wisdom and greatness of Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

The representatives unanimously pointed out in the discussion that the closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to a complete victory, the more the class enemy will struggle desperately. We must heighten our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, strengthen our class struggle and line struggle consciousness, and thoroughly smash all the evil plots of the class enemy to sway or split the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao from the right or ultra-left. We must use Chairman Mao's method of class analysis to view and deal with everything, and be good at identifying those who pretend to be revolutionary but are actually counter-revolutionary.

Tang Jinzhi, a standing committee member of the Heilongjiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee and representative of the revolutionary mass organizations, said: After studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, we have a clearer understanding of the sharpness, complexity, and long-term nature of class struggle. We must heighten our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, intensify the struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads, and carry out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism. We must thoroughly criticize and expose a handful of capitalist-roaders, overthrow and disgrace them, and drag out all spies, traitors, and class enemies, and implement proletarian dictatorship over them.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army must not relax their fighting will in the slightest. Any thought of relaxing fighting will and any thought of underestimating the enemy are wrong." In the discussion, everyone unanimously agreed that in the face of the great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution's continuous victories, we must especially beware of rightist conservative thoughts and prevent the class enemy's sabotage and disruption. We must not think that now we have the power in our hands and the situation is settled, and then relax our fighting will and revolutionary vigilance. We must use the sharp weapon of Mao Zedong Thought to expose all the cunning tricks of the class enemy in the new situation.

Wang Yiming, a standing committee member of the Muling County Revolutionary Committee, said: After our county's revolutionary committee was established last April, we achieved great successes in both revolution and production. In this good situation, some members of the revolutionary committee thought that the capitalist-roaders had been overthrown and the revolution was almost done, and that we should focus on production. Thus, some people were busy with administrative work all day and did not care about politics. The revolutionary masses sharply criticized this approach. The county revolutionary committee seized this issue and promptly organized a province-wide discussion on whether to put revolution first or production first. Through this discussion, the broad revolutionary cadres heightened their class struggle consciousness and realized that at any time, we must grasp this key point of class struggle. The revolutionary committee should be a revolutionary command center leading the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses to fight against the class enemy, and not be reduced to an office that only manages production.

The vast number of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Pinggu County have seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and relevant discussions on class struggle, continuously heightened their class struggle and line struggle consciousness, carried out thorough revolutionary criticism, and achieved a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    以伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示为武器
    狠抓两个阶级两条道路两条路线斗争
    黑龙江省第二次活学活用毛泽东思想代表大会的代表畅谈毛主席最新指示的伟大意义
    据新华社哈尔滨十四日电　毛主席光辉的最新指示，给正在参加黑龙江省第二次活学活用毛泽东思想代表大会的代表们带来了巨大的鼓舞和教育。他们结合黑龙江省一年多来无产阶级文化大革命的战斗历程，畅谈了毛主席最新指示的伟大意义。
    代表们兴奋地说：伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，最深刻地阐明了无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义，最精辟地揭示了无产阶级文化大革命的阶级内容，是鼓舞亿万革命群众夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的新的战斗号令，是向阶级敌人发起主动进攻的锐利武器，我们一定要认真学习、深刻领会。
    伊春市革命委员会副主任李植光说，我们党和国民党反动派已经进行了几十年的斗争。新中国成立前，在我党领导下的广大革命人民群众，以武装斗争推翻了国民党的反动统治，夺取了政权。解放后，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派，代表了国民党反动派即资产阶级和地富反坏右的利益，妄想在中国复辟资本主义。他们这一伙，是我们最危险的敌人。
    著名的劳动模范、甘南县太平大队党总支书记吕和说：我们大队十几年来在合作化道路上发展的历史，就是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的历史。窃踞县、社领导岗位的阶级敌人，在中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义路线的卵翼下，曾经串通一气，狼狈为奸，硬逼着我们分空公共积累，把集体牲畜“下放”到户，拆散集体经济。我们依靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，顶住了这股“三自一包”的黑风。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们贫下中农把这些坏蛋揪了出来，才知道他们有的是漏划的地主分子，有的是投敌自首分子。复杂的阶级斗争教育了我们，使我们更加深刻地认识到毛主席的最新指示的无比英明和无比伟大。
    代表们在座谈中一致指出，无产阶级文化大革命越是接近全面胜利，阶级敌人越要进行垂死挣扎。我们必须百倍提高革命警惕，加强阶级斗争和路线斗争观念，彻底粉碎阶级敌人从右的方面或极“左”方面动摇或分裂以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的一切罪恶阴谋。要用毛主席阶级分析的方法去看待一切，对待一切，善于识别那些伪装革命而实际是反对革命的分子。
    黑龙江省革命委员会常委、革命群众组织代表唐金枝说：学习了毛主席的最新指示以后，我们对阶级斗争的尖锐性、复杂性、长期性认识得更加清楚了。我们要百倍提高革命警惕，狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，深入持久地开展革命的大批判，把一小撮走资派批深批透，斗倒斗臭，把特务、叛徒和一切阶级敌人统统揪出来，对他们实行无产阶级专政。
    毛主席教导我们说：“人民解放军的全体指挥员、战斗员，绝对不可以稍微松懈自己的战斗意志，任何松懈战斗意志的思想和轻敌的思想，都是错误的。”在座谈中，大家一致认为，在无产阶级文化大革命节节胜利的大好形势下，必须特别警惕右倾保守思想，严防阶级敌人的破坏和捣乱。决不能认为现在已经大权在握，大局已定，而稍微松懈自己的战斗意志和革命警惕性。要用毛泽东思想的锐利武器，识破阶级敌人在新形势下采取的一切狡猾伎俩。
    穆棱县革命委员会常委王义明说，我们县在去年四月份成立革命委员会后，革命、生产都取得了很大成绩，在这种大好形势下，革命委员会的有些成员认为走资派已经被打倒，革命搞得差不多了，劲应该往生产上使了。于是，有些人整天忙于事务，不问政治。革命群众对他们这种作法提出了尖锐的批评。县革命委员会抓住这个问题，及时地组织全县干部开展了一个“是把革命放在第一位，还是把生产放在第一位”的大讨论。经过这场大讨论，广大革命干部提高了阶级斗争观念，认识到在任何时候，都要抓住阶级斗争这一个纲。革命委员会应该成为率领无产阶级和广大革命群众向阶级敌人进行战斗的革命指挥部，不能把它降低到一个只管生产的办公室。（附图片）
