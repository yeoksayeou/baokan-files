	In the past, our factory issued each worker a new pair of gloves every month. Originally, old gloves could be repaired and reused, but some people would not wear the old ones once they got new ones, resulting in a large number of old gloves being discarded as waste.

	Since the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of workers have raised their class consciousness and actively responded to Chairman Mao's call to "be thrifty and make revolution." A few workers suggested utilizing the old gloves. They calculated that one pair of gloves requires one chi three cun of cloth, and each person receives twelve pairs a year, which is equivalent to the amount of cloth for one set of work clothes. If all the old gloves are repaired and reused, how much cotton cloth can be saved for the country! This suggestion was supported by the revolutionary committee. They immediately got to work, washing the old gloves clean, and taking apart those that were completely unusable, repairing them onto better gloves, making old gloves look new again. They first made a few pairs as samples for all the workers in the factory to see. Everyone praised this idea after seeing it. Old workers who had come out of the sea of bitterness recalled the scene of workers with calloused hands who had never worn a pair of gloves before liberation, and felt even more deeply that this not only saves cotton cloth for the country, but more importantly, maintains the proletarian spirit. In this way, more than seven hundred pairs of discarded gloves were back in use.

    要保持工人阶级本色
    以前，我们厂每个工人每月发一双新手套。本来旧手套补好还可再用，但有的人有了新的就不愿戴旧的，大量的旧手套都当废品处理了。
    无产阶级文化大革命开始以来，广大职工提高了阶级觉悟，积极响应毛主席“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召，有几个工人建议把旧手套利用起来。他们计算了一下，一双手套要一尺三寸布料，每人每年发十二双，就等于一套工作服的用布。如果把所有的旧手套都补好再用，能为国家节约多少棉布啊！这个意见得到了革命委员会的支持。他们立即动起手来，把旧手套洗干净，把实在不能用的拆开来，补在较好的手套上，整旧如新，先做出几双样子，叫全厂工人参观。大家看了以后，都一致称赞这样做好。从苦海里泡出来的老工人，回忆起解放前工人磨破了手，也从没戴过一双手套的情景，更深深地感到，这样不仅是为国家节约了棉布，更重要的是保持了工人阶级的本色。就这样，七百多双废手套，又重上战场了。
