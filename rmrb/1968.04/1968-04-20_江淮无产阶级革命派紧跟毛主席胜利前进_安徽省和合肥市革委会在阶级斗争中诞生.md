Under the warm care of the Proletarian Headquarters headed by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, the Jianghuai proletarian revolutionary forces march forward in victory under the leadership of Chairman Mao. The revolutionary committees of Anhui Province and Hefei City are born in the midst of class struggle.

On April 19, a grand rally of 300,000 military and civilian personnel in Hefei celebrated the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They unanimously wished long life to the great leader Chairman Mao! Long life to Chairman Mao! They resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's call to arms, supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence and the liberation struggles of all oppressed peoples and nations around the world. They are determined to grasp class struggle, carry out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, launch a comprehensive and fierce attack on class enemies, resolutely oppose rightist conservatism, rightist splitism, and rightist capitulationism, and resolutely suppress all sabotage activities of class enemies. They will consolidate and develop the great alliance of revolution and the three-in-one combination, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, April 19 - Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the heroic 35 million revolutionary people of Anhui, after more than a year of arduous struggle, have won a decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The revolutionary committees of Anhui Province and Hefei City have been born in the storm of class struggle. This is another great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

Just as the revolutionary people of Anhui were celebrating the birth of the revolutionary committees of Anhui Province and Hefei City, the news came of the great leader Mao Zedong's support for the struggle of American blacks against violence. The revolutionary masses and military personnel throughout Anhui enthusiastically hailed the issuance of Chairman Mao's great statement. They expressed their determination to respond to the battle call of the great helmsman Chairman Mao, to redouble their efforts, to strive for the upper hand, and to win a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, so as to build our great socialist motherland even stronger and more powerful, and to support the liberation struggles of our American black brothers and all oppressed peoples and nations in the world.

On the joyous day of celebrating the birth of the revolutionary committees of Anhui Province and Hefei City, from the Huaihe Plain to the water towns of southern Anhui, from the foothills of the Dabie Mountains to the banks of Hongze Lake, everywhere was filled with joy. The smiles of 35 million people greeted the red sun. They all wished long life to the great leader Chairman Mao! Long life to Chairman Mao!

The great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin have always shown great concern for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Anhui. At every critical moment in the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, Chairman Mao has timely given the most brilliant instructions. Chairman Mao's great concern has given the revolutionary people of Anhui boundless courage and endless strength. They have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and launched fierce attacks on the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, such as Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Anhui, defeating the class enemies' repeated ferocious counterattacks and winning one victory after another.

The birth of the revolutionary committees of Anhui Province and Hefei City marks the complete failure of Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Anhui, such as Li Baohua and Huang Yan, in their attempt to restore capitalism in Anhui. For a long time, Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Anhui have been frantically pushing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in all aspects and on all fronts, ruthlessly dismantling agricultural production cooperatives, spreading the individual farming wind of "contracting production to households," and the "reversal of verdicts" wind of counterattack and revenge, committing heinous crimes. The revolutionary people of Anhui, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have been waging a relentless struggle against them, achieving great victories in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the revolutionary people of Anhui, after more than a year of heroic struggle, have seized back the power usurped by Liu Shaoqi's agents in Anhui and placed it in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary forces.

After more than a year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the dictatorship of the proletariat in Anhui Province has been greatly consolidated and strengthened, and the revolutionary situation is getting better and better. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has never been as deeply rooted in the hearts of the people as it is today, and the people have never been as spirited as they are today. The great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought is flourishing, and the flames of revolutionary criticism are burning throughout the province. Under the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, the broad revolutionary masses have been waging a resolute struggle against class enemies without interruption. The great alliance of revolution and the three-in-one combination are becoming more and more consolidated and developed. Industrial and agricultural production is booming.

On April 18, the provincial capital of Hefei was filled with the joyous atmosphere of a festival. Thirty thousand revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and military personnel from all fronts in the province, with hearts full of joy and fighting spirit, carried the giant portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao, held the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and sang "The East Is Red," surging like a spring tide into the provincial stadium to celebrate the birth of the revolutionary committees of Anhui Province and Hefei City.

The celebration began to the majestic tune of "The East Is Red." When the meeting solemnly announced the official establishment of the revolutionary committees of Anhui Province and Hefei City, the entire venue erupted in cheers. People shouted over and over again, "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!" "Long live the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China!" "Long live our dearest and reddest red sun, Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!"

The military personnel of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Anhui and the Anhui Military Region who attended the celebration were warmly welcomed by the revolutionary masses. The broad military personnel of Anhui stationed troops have resolutely implemented the great call of the great helmsman Chairman Mao, "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses," and in the "three supports and two militaries" work, they have grasped class struggle, highlighted proletarian politics, and firmly united and fought with the broad revolutionary masses. They have made great contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Anhui. The revolutionary masses at the celebration repeatedly shouted, "Learn from the People's Liberation Army!" "Salute to the People's Liberation Army!"

Li Degeng, the head of the Anhui Provincial Revolutionary Committee, spoke at the celebration. He said, every victory we have achieved is the result of Chairman Mao's warm care and shines with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought! After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, the most important and fundamental task is to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to take Vice Chairman Lin as a shining example, to be loyal to the great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, and to grasp the use of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We must carry out the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought more broadly and deeply, take class struggle as the key link, grasp the thought revolutionization of the people, and build Anhui Province into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Li Degeng emphasized that Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught us, "Never forget class struggle." Chairman Mao recently pointed out even more profoundly, "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and its led broad revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Chairman Mao's latest brilliant instruction most profoundly expounds the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, most profoundly reveals the class content of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and once again points out the direction for our victory and advance. We must study it seriously, understand it deeply, carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, grasp the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, and launch a comprehensive and fierce attack on the class enemies. We must carry out the revolutionary criticism more deeply and persistently, thoroughly criticize and expose Liu Shaoqi and the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and their agents in Anhui, and thoroughly eliminate traitors, spies, and all counter-revolutionary elements. At present, we must resolutely oppose rightist conservatism, rightist splitism, and rightist capitulationism, and resolutely suppress all sabotage activities of class enemies attempting to shake and split the Proletarian Headquarters headed by Chairman Mao.

Li Degeng said, we must further implement Chairman Mao's great instructions to fight selfishness and revisionism, to support the army and love the people, to grasp revolution and promote production, work, and preparedness, and to do a better job in all aspects. We must consolidate and develop the great alliance of revolution and the three-in-one combination, strengthen military-civilian unity, grasp revolution, and promote production to achieve double victories in revolution and production.

Li Degeng said, the members of the revolutionary committee must take the lead in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, take the lead in carrying out thought revolutionization, and regard studying, implementing, propagating, and defending Mao Zedong Thought as their most sacred duty. They must closely connect with the masses, carry forward the spirit of hard struggle, be both "officials" and "common people," and forever be good servants of the people. We must build the revolutionary committee into a revolutionary headquarters that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, highlights proletarian politics, has proletarian revolutionary authority, is full of vigor, and can lead the revolutionary masses to fight against the enemies of the proletariat in the stormy waves of class struggle.

The military personnel and revolutionary masses attending the meeting unanimously expressed their determination to warmly support and strongly back the newly born provincial and municipal revolutionary committees. They must carry out the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought more broadly and deeply, further consolidate and develop the great alliance of revolution and the three-in-one combination, carry out revolutionary criticism thoroughly and persistently, and do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their own units. They must further carry out the "support the army and love the people" movement, strengthen military-civilian unity, launch a new high tide of "grasp revolution and promote production," fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, win a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and build Anhui into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

General Xu Shiyou, Commander of the Nanjing Military Region, and Political Commissar Zhang Chunqiao attended the meeting and spoke.

Yang Guofu, a member of the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee and Deputy Commander of the Jinan Military Region, spoke at the meeting, warmly congratulating the establishment of the revolutionary committees of Anhui Province and Hefei City.

In the midst of enthusiastic cheers and applause, a telegram of congratulations was sent to our dearest and reddest red sun, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao.

Those attending the celebration also included: Vice Heads of the Anhui Provincial Revolutionary Committee, Liao Chengmei, Song Peizhen, Li Renzhi, Yang Xiaozhen, Xu Wencheng, Zhang Xiuying, and Zhang Jiayun; Head of the Hefei Municipal Revolutionary Committee, Li Quangui; Deputy Heads, Chen Yu and Sun Zhenghua; and members of the provincial and municipal revolutionary committees. Responsible comrades of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Anhui, such as Zhang Wenbi, also attended the celebration.

The parents of the great communist warrior Cai Yongxiang, the father of the "support-left-love-people model platoon" Li Congquan, and the father of Mao's good soldier Nian Siwang also attended the meeting.

After the meeting, a grand celebration parade was held. (See pictures)

On the joyous day of the establishment of the Anhui Provincial Revolutionary Committee, how many people were moved, tears in their eyes, and a thousand words condensed into one sentence, most sincerely wishing long life to our dearest and reddest red sun, the great leader Chairman Mao! Long life to Chairman Mao! Long life to Chairman Mao!

    在以毛主席为首、林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的亲切关怀下
    江淮无产阶级革命派紧跟毛主席胜利前进
    安徽省和合肥市革委会在阶级斗争中诞生
    合肥三十万军民举行盛大集会，热烈欢呼毛主席无产阶级革命路线的新胜利，共同祝愿伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！他们坚决响应毛主席的战斗号召，支持美国黑人抗暴斗争和世界上一切被压迫人民、被压迫民族的解放斗争。他们决心狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，向阶级敌人发动全面猛烈的进攻；坚决反对右倾保守主义、右倾分裂主义和右倾投降主义，坚决镇压阶级敌人的一切破坏活动，巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底
    新华社合肥十九日电　在伟大的毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，英雄的安徽三千五百万革命人民经过一年多的艰苦奋战，夺得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。安徽省和合肥市的革命委员会，在阶级斗争的暴风雨中光荣诞生了。这是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的又一伟大胜利！
    正当安徽省革命人民欢庆安徽省和合肥市革命委员会胜利诞生的时候，传来了无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明。安徽全省广大革命群众和驻军指战员，最热烈地欢呼毛主席的伟大声明的发表。他们表示，坚决响应伟大统帅毛主席的战斗号召，鼓足干劲，力争上游，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，把我们的伟大社会主义祖国建设得更加强大，更加有力地支援美国黑人兄弟和世界上一切被压迫人民、被压迫民族的解放斗争。
    在庆祝安徽省和合肥市革命委员会诞生的大喜日子里，从淮北平原到皖南水乡，从大别山麓到洪泽湖畔，到处一片喜气洋洋。三千五百万人民的笑脸迎着红太阳，人们共同祝愿伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席，非常关怀安徽省的无产阶级文化大革命。在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的每一个关键时刻，毛主席都及时作出了最英明的指示。毛主席的伟大关怀，给了安徽革命人民以无比的勇气和无穷的力量。他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，向中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派以及他们在安徽的代理人发动猛烈进攻，击退了阶级敌人一次又一次的猖狂反扑，取得了一个又一个的胜利。
    安徽省和合肥市革命委员会的诞生，宣告了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在安徽的代理人李葆华、黄岩之流妄图在安徽复辟资本主义的阴谋彻底破产。长期以来，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在安徽的代理人，在各个方面、各条战线上疯狂地推行反革命修正主义路线，大砍农业生产合作社，大刮“包产到户”的单干风，大刮反攻倒算的“翻案”风，犯下了滔天罪行。安徽革命人民，以毛泽东思想为武器，一直同他们进行着针锋相对的斗争，取得了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的重大胜利。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，安徽革命人民经过一年多的英勇战斗，把中国赫鲁晓夫在安徽的代理人所窃取的权力夺回到无产阶级革命派手中。
    经过一年多来的无产阶级文化大革命，安徽省的无产阶级专政得到了很大的巩固和加强，革命形势越来越好。毛主席的无产阶级革命路线从来没有象今天这样深入人心，人民群众从来没有象今天这样精神焕发，活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动蓬勃展开，革命大批判的烈火燃遍了全省城乡。广大革命群众在人民解放军的大力支持下，不停顿地对阶级敌人展开了坚决的斗争。革命大联合和革命三结合越来越巩固和发展。工农业生产蒸蒸日上。
    四月十八日，安徽省省会合肥市，充满了节日的欢乐气氛。来自全省各条战线的无产阶级革命派、革命群众和人民解放军指战员三十万人，满怀胜利喜悦和战斗豪情，抬着伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画像，手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，高唱《大海航行靠舵手》，象春潮一般涌向省体育场，热烈庆祝安徽省和合肥市革命委员会胜利诞生。
    庆祝大会在雄壮的《东方红》乐曲声中开始。当大会庄严宣布安徽省和合肥市革命委员会正式成立时，全场欢声雷动。人们一遍又一遍地纵情高呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想胜利万岁！”“毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！”“伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党万岁！”“我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    参加庆祝大会的人民解放军驻安徽部队和安徽省军区的广大指战员，受到了广大革命群众的热烈欢迎。安徽驻军广大指战员，坚决执行伟大统帅毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召，在“三支”“两军”工作中，狠抓阶级斗争，突出无产阶级政治，坚定地和广大革命群众团结在一起，战斗在一起，在安徽无产阶级文化大革命中立下了巨大的功绩。广大革命群众在庆祝大会上不断高呼：“向人民解放军学习！”“向人民解放军致敬！”
    安徽省革命委员会主任李德生同志在庆祝大会上讲了话。他说，我们取得的每一个胜利，都是毛主席亲切关怀的结果，都闪耀着毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉！革命委员会成立后，最首要、最根本的任务就是更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以林副主席为光辉榜样，对无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席心怀一个“忠”字，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想狠抓一个“用”字，更加广泛深入地开展活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动，以阶级斗争为纲，狠抓人的思想革命化，把我们安徽省建设成为红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    李德生同志强调说，毛主席一再教导我们：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”。毛主席最近又极其深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”毛主席这一光辉的最新指示，最深刻地阐明了无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义，最精辟地揭示了无产阶级文化大革命的阶级内容，又一次为我们指明了胜利前进的航向。我们一定要认真学习，深刻领会，发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，向阶级敌人发动全面猛烈的进攻。我们要更加深入持久地开展革命的大批判，把中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在安徽的代理人批深批透，批倒批臭，彻底清除叛徒、特务和一切反革命分子。当前，我们要坚决反对右倾保守主义、右倾分裂主义和右倾投降主义，坚决镇压阶级敌人妄图动摇和分裂以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的一切破坏活动。
    李德生同志说，我们必须进一步贯彻落实毛主席要斗私、批修，要拥军爱民，要抓革命促生产，促工作，促战备，把各方面的工作做得更好的伟大指示，巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合，大力加强军民团结，狠抓革命，猛促生产，夺取革命、生产双胜利。
    李德生同志说，革命委员会的成员要带头活学活用毛泽东思想，带头搞好思想革命化，把学习、贯彻、宣传、捍卫毛泽东思想作为自己最神圣的职责。要紧密联系群众，发扬艰苦奋斗的作风，“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”，永远当好人民的勤务员。我们要在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，把革命委员会建设成为无限忠于毛主席，突出无产阶级政治，有无产阶级革命权威，朝气蓬勃，能够率领革命群众对无产阶级的敌人进行战斗的革命司令部。
    参加大会的人民解放军和革命群众一致表示，要热情爱护、大力支持新诞生的省、市革命委员会。要更加广泛、更加深入地开展活学活用毛泽东思想的伟大群众运动，进一步巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合，深入地持久地开展革命的大批判，搞好本单位的斗、批、改。要进一步开展“拥军爱民”运动，加强军民团结，掀起“抓革命，促生产”的新高潮，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，把安徽办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    南京军区司令员许世友同志、政治委员张春桥同志出席了大会，并且讲了话。
    山东省革命委员会常委、济南军区副司令员杨国夫同志在大会上讲话，热烈祝贺安徽省和合肥市革命委员会的成立。
