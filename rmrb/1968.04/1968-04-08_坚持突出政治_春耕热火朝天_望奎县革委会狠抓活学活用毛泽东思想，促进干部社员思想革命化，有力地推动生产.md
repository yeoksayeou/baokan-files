The revolutionary committee of Wangkui County has been vigorously promoting the active study and application of Mao Zedong Thought, advancing the ideological revolutionization of cadres and community members, and effectively driving production.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, April 7th: During the busy spring plowing season, the revolutionary committee of Wangkui County in Heilongjiang Province has emphasized proletarian politics, focused on studying the works of Chairman Mao, and used Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything. Now, this county has timely started plowing and sowing, and the fields are everywhere full of a thriving scene.

Last year, the broad revolutionary masses of the city and countryside across the county, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, achieved double victories in revolution and production. Amidst the triumphant songs, some cadres thought that the revolution had succeeded, and it was time to focus on production. Some hoped that the revolutionary committee would organize manpower to go to the countryside, just like in previous years, to focus on "full seedlings and strong seedlings." These ideological tendencies alerted the county revolutionary committee. The standing committee members, with the question of "what to focus on first during the busy spring plowing season," repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." "Without a correct political standpoint, it is like having no soul." Great Mao Zedong Thought illuminated their path forward. They realized that no matter how the work situation changes, all work must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works. This is something that can never be shaken. Only by emphasizing proletarian politics and achieving the ideological revolutionization of people can production be improved. Therefore, the county revolutionary committee and the military department jointly organized an active study and application team of Chairman Mao's works before the spring sowing, which went to ten communes to propagate and implement Chairman Mao's instructions on "grasp revolution, promote production," etc., to 200,000 revolutionary masses. In mid-March, the county held an active study and application meeting of Chairman Mao's works. Subsequently, the county held large-scale Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and the mass movement of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works reached a new high. During the preparation period, some cadres and community members had the idea of "maximum production." The revolutionary committees at all levels and various production teams' Mao Zedong Thought study classes seized this active thought, and held a mass discussion on how to strive for an even greater agricultural harvest this year. The broad community members in the study classes repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "human beings must constantly summarize experience, make discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress." Through summarizing the experience of last year's bumper harvest, they carried out the "Learn from Dazhai, Catch up with Dazhai" activities, pushing the spring plowing production to be in full swing.

In accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings on "streamlining administration," the revolutionary committee of Wangkui County recently took revolutionary measures to significantly reduce the number of administrative levels, and allocated a batch of backbones to strengthen the leadership at the commune level, effectively promoting spring plowing production.

    坚持突出政治　春耕热火朝天
    望奎县革委会狠抓活学活用毛泽东思想，促进干部社员思想革命化，有力地推动生产
    据新华社哈尔滨七日电　黑龙江省望奎县革委会在春耕大忙季节，突出无产阶级政治，狠抓毛主席著作的学习，用毛泽东思想统帅一切。现在，这个县已适时开犁播种，田野上到处呈现欣欣向荣景象。
    去年，全县城乡广大革命群众在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，夺得了革命、生产双胜利。在一片凯歌声中，一些干部认为，革命已经成功了，劲该往生产上使了。有的人希望革命委员会组织人力下乡，和往年一样抓“苗全、苗壮”这个“中心”。这些思想苗头引起了县革命委员会的警惕。常委们带着“春耕大忙首先抓什么”的问题，一遍又一遍地学习毛主席的教导：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”伟大的毛泽东思想照亮了他们前进的方向。他们认识到：尽管工作情况千变万化，但任何工作都要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，这是永远也不能动摇的。只有突出无产阶级政治、实现人的思想革命化，生产才能搞好。因此，这个县的革命委员会和人民武装部，在春播以前，联合组织了一个活学活用毛主席著作讲用团，深入到十个人民公社，向二十万革命群众宣传、落实毛主席“抓革命，促生产”等指示。三月中旬，全县又召开了活学活用毛主席著作讲用会。接着，全县又大办毛泽东思想学习班，活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动出现了新的高潮。在备耕期间，有的干部和群众产生了增产到顶的思想，各级革命委员会和各个社队的毛泽东思想学习班，就抓住这个活思想，以如何争取今年农业更大丰收为题，开展了群众性的大讨论。广大社员在学习班里反复学习毛主席关于“人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进”的教导，通过总结去年大丰收的经验，开展学大寨赶大寨的活动，推动春耕生产搞得热火朝天。
    遵照毛主席“精兵简政”的教导，望奎县革命委员会最近还采取革命化措施，大刀阔斧地减少机构层次，调出一批骨干力量充实公社一级的领导力量，有力地推动了春耕生产。
