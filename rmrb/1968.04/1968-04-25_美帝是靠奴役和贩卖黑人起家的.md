The U.S. empire was built on the enslavement and trafficking of Black people. The more than 20 million Black people in the United States, who make up about 11% of the total population, originally did not live in America. They were kidnapped from Africa by European colonialists and brought to the Americas to become slaves.

The trafficking of slaves was an important means of primitive accumulation for European capitalism. Starting in the 15th century, Western colonialists began using deception, kidnapping, and even raiding Black villages to seize large numbers of Black people, loading them onto ships and transporting them to the Americas for sale. The colonialists shackled the Black people with handcuffs and leg irons, cramming them into ship holds where they could barely stand. Many Black people died from torture during the voyage. To suppress Black resistance, the slave traders subjected Black people to various tortures, even cutting off hands, heads, and throwing them into the sea. During storms or when the ship ran out of food and water, they often threw entire shipments of slaves into the sea, displaying extreme brutality.

After being transported to the Americas, the colonialists drove the Black people to the slave market like cattle. In the trafficking of Black people, slave traders could make profits of 100% or even 1,000%. A slave ship called "Aphrodite" in Baltimore, USA, cost $30,000 to build, but made $200,000 on its first slave-trading voyage. This evil trade accumulated a large amount of capital for the bloody development of capitalism; at the same time, it also provided the colonialists with a large number of cheap laborers to open plantations and other enterprises in the Americas. According to the research of the famous Black scholar W.E.B. Du Bois, over several hundred years, approximately 15 million Black people were transported from Africa to the Americas. The 34 million Black people and 18 million mixed-race people now living in North and South America are descendants of African Black people.

At that time, the United States was the largest slave market. Many states passed laws declaring Black people to be lifelong slaves and listing them as freely tradable commodities. American colonists used these inhuman methods to accumulate capital and obtain cheap labor to develop and operate plantations, factories, and enterprises. Due to the use of a large number of Black agricultural slaves, the land occupied by American plantation owners became increasingly vast, and their profits increased exponentially. For example, in 1793, the cotton production in the area around Georgia and South Carolina was only 2-3 million pounds, but by 1820, it had surged to 160 million pounds.

By the 19th century, the U.S. empire controlled the slave trade in the Western Hemisphere and made even greater fortunes. After the American Civil War, the U.S. Congress amended the Constitution, nominally requiring states to abolish the slave system. However, this was a deceitful ploy, as the vast majority of Black people still suffered under oppression and exploitation.

As American capitalism entered the imperialist stage, American Black people not only faced political discrimination and powerlessness but also suffered more brutal exploitation by American monopolies. In 1962 alone, American capitalists extracted $14 billion in excess profits from Black workers.

The bloody history of Black people's enslavement and today's burgeoning struggle against oppression vividly prove the profound insight of our great leader Chairman Mao: "The evil system of colonialism and imperialism, which rose with the enslavement and trafficking of Black people, will inevitably come to an end with the complete liberation of the Black race."

### 美帝是靠奴役和贩卖黑人起家的

    美帝是靠奴役和贩卖黑人起家的
    约占美国总人口百分之十一的两千多万美国黑人的祖先，原来并不住在美国。他们被欧美殖民强盗从非洲掳掠到美洲大陆沦为奴隶。
    贩卖奴隶是欧洲资本主义原始积累的一个重要手段。从十五世纪起，西方殖民主义者就开始用欺骗、掳掠，甚至用偷袭黑人村庄的办法，抢劫大批黑人，装上船运到美洲贩卖。殖民强盗给黑人戴上手铐脚镣，把他们塞进仅能坐起身子的船舱里。许多黑人在航行途中就被折磨而死。为了镇压黑人的反抗，奴隶贩子们对黑人施加种种酷刑，甚至砍手、断头和扔到海里去。遇到风暴或船上缺粮少水时，还常常把整船奴隶扔进海里，残暴至极。
    黑人被运到美洲后，殖民强盗就把他们当作牲口赶到奴隶市场上出卖。在贩卖黑人中，奴隶贩子可以获得百分之一百、甚至百分之一千的厚利。美国巴尔的摩有一艘贩奴船“爱神号”，建造费是三万美元，第一次贩奴航行就赚了二十万美元。这种罪恶的买卖，为血腥的资本主义的发展积累了大量资金；同时，也为殖民主义者开辟美洲的种植园和其它企业，获得了大量廉价劳动力。据美国著名黑人学者杜波依斯研究，几百年来，先后从非洲运到美洲的黑人大约有一千五百万。现在居住在南北美洲的三千四百多万黑人和一千八百万黑白混血种人，就是非洲黑人的后裔。
    当时，美国是最大的奴隶市场，许多州的议会还通过法律，把黑人定为终身奴隶，列为可以自由买卖的商品。美国殖民者用这种惨无人道的手段积累资本，获得廉价劳动力，来发展和开办种植园、工厂和企业。由于使用大量黑人农奴，美国种植园主扩占的土地越来越大，获得的利润越来越多。如一七九三年，佐治亚州和南卡罗来纳州一带，年产棉花只有二、三百万磅，但到一八二○年，就猛增到一亿六千万磅。
    到十九世纪，美帝控制着西半球的奴隶买卖，更加大发横财。美国南北战争后，美国国会修改了宪法，名义上规定各州要废除奴隶制度。但是，这完全是骗人的把戏，实际上广大黑人仍处在被奴役、被压迫的水深火热之中。
    随着美国资本主义进入帝国主义阶段，美国黑人不仅在政治上横遭歧视，处于无权地位，美国垄断资本对他们的剥削也更加残酷。一九六二年一年中，美国资本家从黑人劳动者身上剥削的超额利润高达一百四十亿美元。
    美国黑人被奴役的血泪史和今天抗暴斗争的蓬勃发展，雄辩地证明了我们伟大领袖毛主席的英明论断：“万恶的殖民主义、帝国主义制度是随着奴役和贩卖黑人而兴盛起来的，它也必将随着黑色人种的彻底解放而告终。”　　　（据新华社）
