Members of Haiyang County Revolutionary Committee Follow Chairman Mao's Teaching to Serve the People Wholeheartedly and Frequently Go to the Grassroots to Maintain Close Ties with the Masses

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, April 18 — Following the great teacher Chairman Mao's teaching to "serve the people wholeheartedly and never detach from the masses for a moment," the Shandong Province Haiyang County Revolutionary Committee has insisted on having more than two-thirds of its members frequently go to the grassroots to maintain close ties with the masses, which has been praised and trusted by the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

In its early days, the Haiyang County Revolutionary Committee spent three-quarters of its time holding various meetings and handling specific matters, rarely going among the masses. With the help of the PLA comrades, the committee members seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings on maintaining close ties with the masses and adhering to the mass line. They realized that if the revolutionary committee could not maintain close ties with the masses, it would inevitably go back to being a bureaucratic organization. To truly do as Chairman Mao taught, "never detach from the masses for a moment," they must better study and apply Chairman Mao's thoughts, strengthen the transformation of their world outlook, and earnestly carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The revolutionary committee decided that, except for a few who take turns being on duty at the office, more than two-thirds of the members must frequently go among the masses, eating, living, working, studying Chairman Mao's works, and fighting private thoughts and revisionism together with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, being both "officials" and "common people," so that the revolutionary committee can truly take root among the masses.

According to this decision, the committee members, carrying Chairman Mao's works, shouldering hoes, and carrying their luggage, went to various communes and production teams. During the day, they worked with the poor and lower-middle peasants on spring plowing and production, and in the evenings and rest times, they held Mao Zedong Thought study classes with the poor and lower-middle peasants, carried out revolutionary criticism and self-criticism, and fought private thoughts and revisionism. Committee member Liang Chunzhang went to a remote mountainous area more than 100 miles away from the county revolutionary committee and found that transportation was inconvenient and there was no wired broadcast, so Chairman Mao's latest instructions had not been widely disseminated among the masses, and there were some problems in the revolution and production. He then propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions in some production brigades in this area, held Mao Zedong Thought study classes with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and promoted the revolution and production in these brigades. The Tangshan River Diversion Project in this county was originally planned to be completed in 20 days, but it had been delayed for a long time without completion. Committee vice-chairman Liu Yuangin went to this construction site and found out, while working with the commune members, that the main reason for the slow progress of the project was that the commune members lacked understanding of the political significance of this project, and the cooperation among the more than 20 brigades on the construction site was not good. Liu Yuangin discussed with the construction site cadres and held a Mao Zedong Thought study class on the construction site to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions. In the study class, through self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, the barriers between the brigades were removed, unity was strengthened, and the progress of the project was greatly accelerated.

The committee members went among the masses to summarize the experience of holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, making the Mao Zedong Thought study classes in the whole county better and better, and pushing the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the whole county to a new high tide. Now, the whole county has held more than 15,000 sessions of various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with more than 210,000 people participating in the study.

The members of the Haiyang County Revolutionary Committee went among the masses, humbly learned from the masses, accepted the supervision of the masses, and often made self-criticisms to the masses. Non-full-time committee member, 21-year-old Xin Jianyou, had a period of attending many meetings outside, and after returning to the village, some commune members told him, "It's time to hold the hoe again." This remark immediately caught his attention. He immediately shouldered the hoe, barefoot, and went to work with the commune members. The committee members took the masses' criticisms, even if it was just a few words, seriously. Everyone was diligent and determined to be good servants of the people. The Haiyang County Revolutionary Committee insisted on the system of having more than two-thirds of its members frequently staying with the masses, which greatly promoted the thought revolutionization of the committee members, strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses, and achieved one victory after another in the revolution and production in the whole county.

    海阳县革委会成员遵照毛主席“全心全意地为人民服务”的教导
    经常深入基层  密切联系群众
    新华社济南十八日电　山东省海阳县革命委员会遵照伟大导师毛主席“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众”的教导，坚持经常有三分之二以上的革委会成员深入基层，密切联系群众，受到广大贫下中农的赞扬和信赖。
    海阳县革命委员会在成立初期，曾经把三分之二的时间用于召开各种会议，处理各种具体事务，很少深入群众。在解放军同志的帮助下，革委会成员认真学习了毛主席关于密切联系群众、坚持群众路线的教导，大家认识到，革委会如果不能密切联系群众，就必然要走回头路，变成官僚化的机构。为了真正做到“一刻也不脱离群众”，必须更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，加强世界观的改造，认真落实毛主席的最新指示。革命委员会决定：除少数人在机关轮流值班外，三分之二以上的成员必须经常到群众里面去，和广大贫下中农同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习毛主席著作、同斗私批修，“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”，使革命委员会真正扎根于群众之中。
    按照这个决定，革委会成员带着毛主席著作，扛着镢头，背着行李，到各公社、生产队去，白天和贫下中农一起搞春耕生产，晚上和休息时间同贫下中农一起大办毛泽东思想学习班，一起开展革命大批判，一起斗私批修。革委会常委梁春长同志，来到离县革委会一百多里路的一个偏僻山区，发现这里交通不便、又没有有线广播，毛主席的最新指示还没有普遍同群众见面，革命和生产都存在着一些问题。他便在这里的一些生产大队宣传毛主席的最新指示，同贫下中农一起办毛泽东思想学习班，推动了这些大队的革命和生产。这个县的唐山口拦河截流工程，原计划二十天完工，但是拖延了很久还没有结束。革委会副主任刘元金同志来到这个工地，在和社员一起劳动的过程中，发现工程进展不快的主要原因是，社员们对这一工程的政治意义缺乏认识，工地上二十多个大队的社员互相协作不够。刘元金同志与工地干部研究，在工地开办了毛泽东思想学习班，学习毛主席的最新指示。在学习班里，通过斗私批修，队与队之间消除了隔阂，加强了团结，工程进度大大加快。
    革委会的成员到群众中去总结大办毛泽东思想学习班的经验，使全县的毛泽东思想学习班越办越好，把全县活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向了新高潮。现在，全县已举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班一万五千多期，有二十一万多人参加了学习。
    海阳县革命委员会成员到群众里面去，甘当群众的小学生，接受群众的监督，经常向群众作自我批评。不脱产的常委、二十一岁的辛建友同志，有一个时期外出开会较多，回村以后有的社员对他说：“该摸摸镢柄了。”这句话立刻引起他的重视。他立即扛起镢头，打着赤脚，同社员一起去参加劳动。革委会成员对群众的批评，那怕是一言半语的批评，都认真对待，大家兢兢业业，决心当好人民的勤务员。海阳县革命委员会坚持三分之二以上成员经常和群众在一起的制度，大大促进了革委会成员的思想革命化，密切了干群关系，使全县革命和生产取得了一个又一个的胜利。
