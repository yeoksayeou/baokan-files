The Command Headquarters of the People's Liberation Armed Forces in South Vietnam issued a special bulletin on the 20th, stating that in the 75 days up to April 15, the military and people of South Vietnam have continuously attacked the enemy and repulsed the enemy's numerous ferocious counterattacks, achieving unprecedented great and comprehensive victories. According to incomplete statistics, in 75 days, the military and people of South Vietnam have killed, wounded, and captured over 200,000 enemy troops, including 60,000 U.S. invaders and their lackeys.

The bulletin said that during this period, the military and people of South Vietnam have annihilated and severely damaged three enemy armored regiments, one airborne combat regiment, 73 infantry battalions, 270 companies, and 10 armored battalions; shot down and destroyed 2,500 enemy aircraft of various types, destroyed and damaged 2,380 tanks and armored vehicles, and thousands of other military vehicles, sunk and damaged 330 ships and boats, destroyed 346 cannons of various types, burned 385 warehouses, captured 970 strongholds and outposts, blown up 400 bridges, liberated vast rural areas, and dissolved tens of thousands of puppet troops.

The bulletin said that the above achievements mark the leap forward of our military and people and the heavy defeat of the enemy on the battlefield. In 75 days, the military and people of South Vietnam have eliminated enemy combat forces equivalent to nearly two-thirds of the total enemy casualties in 1967.

The bulletin pointed out that under the heavy blows of the military and people of South Vietnam, the Saigon puppet regime is in a state of collapse, the United States is in chaos, and all counterattacks by the U.S.-Saigon troops have been smashed. The economy of the Saigon puppet regime and the United States is facing unprecedented crises. As Chairman Ho Chi Minh said, "The failure of the United States is evident."

The bulletin pointed out that the U.S.-Saigon clique, in a desperate situation, is making a final struggle. Therefore, the battles of the military and people of South Vietnam in the future will be extremely arduous and fierce, but they will certainly achieve even more glorious victories.

The bulletin calls on all the military and people of South Vietnam to resolutely maintain and further develop the victories already achieved, continue to strike the enemy with greater ferocity, eliminate more enemy combat forces, smash all enemy counterattacks, destroy the enemy's military organizations, thoroughly defeat the U.S. aggressors, overthrow the puppet regime of Nguyen Van Thieu and Nguyen Cao Ky, and decisively achieve complete victory.

According to a report from the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, the Political Bureau of the People's Liberation Armed Forces in South Vietnam issued a directive on April 21, calling on the armed forces to launch a competition to shoot down more U.S. aggressor aircraft.

The directive said that on April 19, the military and people in the western area of Route 12 in Thua Thien Province shot down 34 U.S. helicopters in one day, killing nearly 300 U.S. troops. This was the most outstanding battle in striking the U.S. airborne troops and shooting down the most aircraft. This victory embodies the spirit of continuous attacks on the enemy and bravery and wisdom, and is an extremely outstanding achievement of the main force, local forces, and guerrilla forces of the People's Liberation Armed Forces working in close coordination.

The directive calls on all officers and soldiers of the main force, local forces, and guerrilla forces of the People's Liberation Armed Forces to launch a competition to learn from, catch up with, and surpass the military and people in the western area of Route 12, shoot down and destroy more enemy aircraft, and make every soldier a "hero who shoots down U.S. aircraft."

    新华社河内二十七日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方人民解放武装力量指挥部二十日发表第五号特别公报说，截至四月十五日为止的七十五天中，越南南方军民连续进攻敌人，并且挫败了敌人的多次疯狂反扑，赢得了前所未有的巨大和全面的胜利。据不完全统计，越南南方军民在七十五天中，打死、打伤和俘虏敌人二十多万名，其中包括美国侵略军和帮凶军六万名。
    公报说，在这期间，越南南方军民全歼和重创敌军三个装甲团、一个空降战团、七十三个步兵营、二百七十个连和十个装甲营；击落和摧毁各种敌机二千五百架，击伤击毁坦克和装甲车二千三百八十辆以及其他军车成千辆，击沉击伤船艇三百三十艘，击毁各种大炮三百四十六门，烧毁各种仓库三百八十五座，攻克九百七十个据点和哨所，炸毁桥梁四百座，解放了大片农村，瓦解了成十万伪军。
    公报说，上述战绩标志着我们军民的飞跃进步和敌人在战场上的惨重失败。在七十五天里，越南南方军民消灭的敌人有生力量相当于一九六七年歼敌总数的近三分之二。
    公报指出，在越南南方军民的沉重打击下，西贡伪政权正陷于土崩瓦解的境地，美国国内一片混乱，美伪军的一切反扑都被越南南方军民粉碎，西贡伪政权和美国的经济面临空前未有的危机。正如胡志明主席所说的：“美国的失败是明显的了。”
    公报指出，处于走投无路的美伪集团正在进行垂死挣扎，因此，越南南方军民今后的战斗将是极其艰巨和极其激烈的，但是必将取得更辉煌的胜利。
    公报号召全体越南南方军民坚决保持和不断发扬已经取得的胜利，继续给敌人以更猛烈的打击，消灭更多的敌人有生力量，粉碎敌人的一切反扑，砸烂敌人的军事机构，彻底战胜美国侵略者，推翻阮文绍—阮高其伪政权，坚决夺取彻底胜利。
    新华社河内二十六日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方人民解放武装力量政治局于四月二十一日向人民解放武装力量发出指示，号召他们开展竞赛运动，击落更多的美国强盗飞机。
    指示说，承天省十二号公路西部地区军民四月十九日一天击落美国直升飞机三十四架，消灭美军近三百名，这是打击美国空降部队最出色、击落飞机最多的一次战斗。这一胜利体现了连续进攻敌人和英勇机智的精神，是人民解放武装力量主力部队、地方部队和游击队巧妙配合所取得的极其出色的战绩。
    指示号召人民解放武装力量主力部队、地方部队和游击队的全体指战员开展学、赶、超十二号公路西部地区军民的竞赛运动，击落击毁更多的敌机，使每个战士都成为“击落美国飞机勇士”。
