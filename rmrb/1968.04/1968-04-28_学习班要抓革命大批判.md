The great leader Chairman Mao has taught us: "One of the important tasks on our ideological front at present is to carry out a criticism of revisionism."

A thorough criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line represented by China's Khrushchev, and a thorough cleansing of their poison in all fields, is an important aspect of the political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. It is an important component of seizing a comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization.

Various types of Mao Zedong Thought study sessions must always direct their spearhead at China's Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, as well as their agents in various regions and units. In conjunction with the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their own units, they must carry out a deep and sustained revolutionary criticism.

If study sessions slacken in revolutionary criticism, they will slacken in the struggle against the enemies of the proletariat and deviate from the major direction of the struggle.

Study sessions must take "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key link. Fighting selfishness means arming the minds of revolutionary cadres and the broad masses of revolutionaries with Mao Zedong Thought, and raising their level of proletarian revolutionariness. Criticizing revisionism means using Mao Zedong Thought to struggle against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, exposing and criticizing their counter-revolutionary revisionist line. The struggle against selfishness and the struggle against revisionism must be combined. Only by fighting selfishness well can the struggle against revisionism be carried through to the end. At the same time, only by fighting selfishness in the struggle against revisionism can it be raised to the level of class struggle and line struggle, and truly spark a revolution in one's soul. If one talks about fighting selfishness without criticizing revisionism, there is the danger of "repenting in seclusion" without class struggle. As for those who use the name of fighting selfishness to persecute revolutionary cadres of the proletariat, attempting to make them look dispirited, this is in fact catering to the needs of the class enemy, denying the merits of the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat, and denying the great victories of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. Such practices of boosting the prestige of the bourgeoisie and undermining the morale of the proletariat must be resolutely opposed and resisted.

The revolutionary cadres of the proletariat must unite on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, hoist high the great banner of revolutionary criticism, and launch a sustained and fierce attack on the class enemy!

    学习班要抓革命大批判
    本报评论员
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判。”
    彻底批判以中国赫鲁晓夫为总代表的反革命修正主义路线，彻底肃清他们在各个领域里的流毒，这是无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的这场政治大革命的重要方面，是从思想上、政治上、经济上、组织上夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的重要组成部分。
    举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，任何时候都要把矛头对准中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在各地区、各单位的代理人，结合本单位的斗、批、改，把革命的大批判深入地持久地开展下去。
    办学习班，如果放松革命的大批判，就是放松对无产阶级的敌人的斗争，就会背离斗争的大方向。
    办学习班，要以“斗私，批修”为纲。斗私，就是用毛泽东思想武装无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众的头脑，提高他们的无产阶级的革命性。批修，就是用毛泽东思想，去同党内一小撮走资派作斗争，揭露和批判他们的反革命修正主义路线。斗私和批修必须结合起来进行。只有很好地斗私，才能更好地把反修斗争进行到底。同时，也只有在批修中斗私，才能把斗私提到阶级斗争的高度、路线斗争的高度，在灵魂深处真正爆发革命。如果离开了批修谈斗私，就有脱离阶级斗争来“闭门思过”的危险。至于有人借用斗私的名义来整无产阶级革命派，企图把他们搞得灰溜溜的，那就是事实上迎合了阶级敌人的需要，否定无产阶级革命派的功勋，否定无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。对于这种长资产阶级威风、灭无产阶级志气的做法，必须坚决抵制、坚决反对。
    无产阶级革命派在毛泽东思想基础上团结起来，高举革命大批判的伟大旗帜，向阶级敌人发动猛烈的持久的进攻！
