Last March, at a crucial moment when the revolutionary masses of Baiqian County in Heilongjiang Province were engaged in a decisive battle against the capitalist roaders, we were assigned the task of organizing urban residents to rush the drying of state granary grain. At that time, there were no tools for drying the grain, nor was there a fixed location. Dividing thousands of tons of state granary grain among individual households for drying was also done under the condition that the two major revolutionary mass organizations had not yet united. Could the task be completed? Would there be any problems? We had no confidence. The comrades from the Grain Bureau also reminded us: "Doing it this way is unprecedented in history. If not handled properly, problems may arise."

We repeatedly considered: Although the comrades in our propaganda team had done some mass work, none of us had experience in mobilizing the masses to dry grain. Dividing the grain for drying is not a small matter. If not handled properly, it would cause losses to the state. However, we also thought, didn't Chairman Mao teach us: "We must believe in the masses, we must believe in the Party, these are two fundamental principles"? Chairman Mao also sharply pointed out: "If you doubt these two principles, then you can accomplish nothing." After studying and discussing, we all agreed that believing in the masses means first believing that the masses love Chairman Mao the most and listen to Chairman Mao the most. The masses can grasp Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, we decided to turn the process of mobilizing the masses to dry grain into a process of propagating Mao Zedong Thought to the masses, to let the red sun further illuminate the hearts of every individual. To make every individual understand the great significance of rushing the drying of state granary grain and to impress Chairman Mao's great strategic line of "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people" deeply in their hearts, we held large and small meetings for propaganda. We went down to have heart-to-heart talks with the masses and also compiled artistic performances to sing in the streets and alleys.

Throughout the process of mobilizing the masses to dry grain, we consistently studied and applied the "Three Articles" with the masses. The broad masses, with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, learned a little and applied a little, continuously learning and continuously applying, quickly launching a wave of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in practice. On the grain-drying sites, Chairman Mao's quotations and songs echoed day and night. Housewives, the elderly, and children all held the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," surrounded by the golden state granary grain, linked their thoughts to reality, and enthusiastically discussed their experiences in breaking down selfishness and establishing public spirit and actively participating in drying state granary grain. An eighty-something-year-old grandmother, after studying the "Three Articles," also requested to participate in drying grain. Everyone advised her to rest at home, but she said: "Comrade Norman Bethune is a Canadian Communist who came to our China to fight the Japanese invaders with us. The grain is right at my doorstep, how can I not contribute my strength!" A sister worked hard all day and found that there were dozens of soybeans in the patch on her pants. She thought of Chairman Mao's teaching of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, and in the dark, she returned the soybeans to the grain-drying site.

It is in this way that we insist on using Mao Zedong Thought as the banner, carry out the struggle to break down selfishness and establish public spirit, rely on the political awareness of the masses, and solve one problem after another in the process of drying grain. There was no place, and the masses voluntarily leveled their own garden plots; there was a shortage of labor, and whether it was the white-haired elderly or preschool children, they all actively joined this struggle. The biggest difficulty was that there was too much grain and too few covers, and it could not be dried in time. The masses took out their own covers and quilts. Some people took apart a quilt and spread both the inner and outer layers on the ground to dry the grain. In a town with more than six thousand households, in just a few days, the masses voluntarily contributed more than nine thousand pieces of large cloth. The neighborhood committee member, Comrade Men Tingfang, contributed fifteen pieces of cloth, even taking out the quilts and bedding that had been preserved for many years for use in drying grain. She said: "Studying the 'Three Articles,' breaking down the 'self' character, and establishing the 'public' character, what is contributed is a few items, but what is learned is Chairman Mao's thought of 'completely' and 'thoroughly' serving the people."

In twenty days, without spending a single cent of the state's money, without damaging a single tool of the state, and without losing a single grain of state granary grain, we completed the grain-drying task 50% over the quota. Summarizing our experience in organizing the masses to complete the grain-drying task, we can list many points, but among all these points, the most fundamental one is to highlight proletarian politics and rely on the mighty power of Mao Zedong Thought.

    红太阳照亮了群众的心
    某部支农毛泽东思想宣传队
    去年三月，正当黑龙江省拜泉县的无产阶级革命派同资产阶级反动路线进行决战的关键时刻，我们接受了组织城镇居民抢晒国库粮的任务。当时，既没有晒粮的工具，又没有固定的场地，把上千吨国库粮分散到一家一户去晒，又是处在两大派革命群众组织还没有联合的情况下，能不能完成任务？会不会出什么问题？我们毫无把握。粮食局的同志也提醒我们：
  “这样搞，可是史无前例，弄不好，会出问题的。”
    我们反复考虑：我们宣传队的同志虽然多少做过一些群众工作，但是谁也没有发动群众晒粮的经验。分散晒粮这可不是一件小事，搞不好，就会给国家造成损失。但是，又一想，毛主席不是教导我们说：
  “我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党，这是两条根本的原理”吗？毛主席还尖锐地指出：“如果怀疑这两条原理，那就什么事情也做不成了。”经过学习、讨论，大家认为，相信群众，首先就是要相信群众最热爱毛主席，最听毛主席的话，群众能够掌握毛泽东思想。于是我们决定把发动群众晒粮的过程，作为向群众宣传毛泽东思想的过程，要让红太阳进一步照亮每个群众的心。为了使每个群众了解抢晒国库粮的重大意义，把毛主席“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大战略方针印在心坎上，我们召开了大会、小会进行宣传。我们分头下去与群众谈心，还编排了文艺节目，到街头巷尾去演唱。
    在发动群众晒粮的过程中，我们自始至终和群众一起大学大用“老三篇”。广大群众怀着无限忠于毛主席的一颗红心，学一点，用一点，不断地学，不断地用，很快地掀起了一个活学活用毛泽东思想的热潮。晒粮场上，一天到晚毛主席语录歌声四处回荡，家庭妇女和老人、小孩，人人手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，围着金黄的国库粮，联系思想实际，大谈破私立公、积极参加晒国库粮的心得体会。一位八十多岁的老奶奶学了“老三篇”，也要求参加晒粮，大伙劝她在家休息，她说：“白求恩同志是加拿大共产党员，还到咱中国来，和咱一起打日本强盗，这粮就在我家门口，我怎能不出一把力！”一位大嫂辛辛苦苦忙了一天，晚上回家发现裤腿上的补钉里装着十几颗黄豆。她想起毛主席“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的教导，摸黑把黄豆送回晒粮场。
    我们就是这样坚持用毛泽东思想挂帅，开展破私立公的斗争，依靠群众的政治觉悟，解决了晒粮过程中一个个难题。没有场地，群众自动平掉自己的园田地；劳力不足，不论是白发苍苍的老人，还是学龄前儿童，都主动投入了这一场斗争。最大的困难是粮食多，苫垫少，晒不过来。群众就拿出自己的垫单、被里。有的人把一床被子拆开，将里表两层一起摊在地上晒粮。六千多户人家的一个镇上，短短几天里，群众自动拿出来的大幅布料有九千多件。居民组长门廷芳同志一家就拿出布料十五件，连保存了多年的嫁妆被褥也拿出来供晒粮使用。她说：“学习‘老三篇’，破掉‘私’字，立起‘公’字，拿出来的是几件东西，学到的是毛主席他老人家‘完全’‘彻底’为人民服务的思想。”
    在二十几天时间里，没花费国家一分钱，没损坏国家一件工具，没遗失国库一点粮食，超额百分之五十完成了晒粮任务。总结我们这次组织群众完成晒粮任务的体会，可以摆出许多条，但是，千条万条，最根本的一条，是突出了无产阶级政治，依靠了毛泽东思想的强大威力。
