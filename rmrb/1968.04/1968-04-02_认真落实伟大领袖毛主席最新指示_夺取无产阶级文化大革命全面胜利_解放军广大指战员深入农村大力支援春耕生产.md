The broad masses of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army have gone deep into the countryside to vigorously support spring farming.

They take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, actively help the commune members to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, learn from the revolutionary spirit of Dazhai, and carry out extensive and in-depth revolutionary criticism and struggle. They help the grassroots units to establish and improve the leading cadres, making the revolution and production in various places flourish.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 31st, the People's Liberation Army's agricultural support troops and Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, following Chairman Mao's instructions to "grasp revolution and promote production," have since the beginning of spring gone deep into the countryside to support spring farming. The broad masses of soldiers and officers, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, taking Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, actively help the commune members to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, learn and apply Chairman Mao's works; extensively mobilize the commune members to carry out revolutionary criticism and struggle, raising their class struggle consciousness; help the grassroots units to establish and improve the leading cadres, grasp revolution and promote production. Under the support and help of the soldiers and officers, the revolution and production in various places have flourished.

The broad masses of soldiers and officers who have achieved great results in agricultural support work have, since the Spring Festival, actively prepared for supporting spring farming. Many military party committees have specially studied and arranged for specific personnel to be responsible for the work of supporting spring farming. As soon as the spring farming season arrives, the soldiers and officers immediately take action, shoulder their bags, and rush to the production front line. The soldiers and officers of a certain unit in North China, together with the revolutionary cadres and representatives of revolutionary mass organizations of counties, districts, and communes, formed a "three-in-one combination" Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of 100,000 people, going to communes, brigades, and production teams. The Lanzhou Military Region sent more than 15,000 officers and soldiers to form more than 500 Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams, going deep into more than 110 counties' communes and production teams. The Shenyang and Jinan Military Regions each dispatched more than 10,000 soldiers and officers to strengthen agricultural support. The Guangzhou, Nanjing, and Wuhan Military Regions are also enthusiastically supporting spring farming. The officers and soldiers and their families of a certain unit stationed on Hainan Island all went out, going deep into the villages of the Li and Miao ethnic minorities, helping the broad masses of commune members to grasp revolution and promote production.

"To sail the vast ocean, one needs a helmsman; to carry out revolution, one needs Mao Zedong Thought," the soldiers and officers said that as soon as they arrived in the countryside, the first thing they did was to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the great Mao Zedong Thought to the broad poor and lower-middle peasants. They said, "No matter how much support, the greatest support is to help the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres to grasp Mao Zedong Thought; no matter how important, the most important thing is to use the great Mao Zedong Thought to guide production." They organized the commune members to study Chairman Mao's works and the relevant decisions and notices of the Central Committee through various forms. The soldiers and officers, in accordance with the various problems existing in spring farming, helped the masses to hold various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The agricultural support personnel of a certain naval unit on the front line of the South China Sea held a special study class on the spot to grasp revolution and promote production, making the broad masses realize that doing a good job in spring farming is an important link in achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The agricultural support troops in Yitong, Jilin, discussed with the commune members in the study class: "Last year, we had a bumper harvest. What should we do this year?" helping some commune members to overcome the mood of stopping after achieving results. Some units also helped the communes to hold militia and cadre study classes, better playing their role as shock troops and backbone in spring farming. In supporting spring farming, the broad masses of soldiers and officers often labored with the masses, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works together, and carried out revolutionary criticism and struggle together. The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams sent by the naval direct-affiliated units to 12 communes in Yanqing County, Beijing, organized various criticism meetings, and together with the masses criticized the revisionist line in agriculture pushed by China's Khrushchev and the former Beijing Municipal Party Committee. The agricultural support troops in Guangxi, in combination with the local situation, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants of the Zhuang ethnic minority, severely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of China's Khrushchev. The personnel of a certain air force unit took the blood and tears history of the poor and lower-middle peasants in the old society as a textbook, and together with the masses criticized China's Khrushchev's theory of "exploitation is meritorious." Through revolutionary criticism and struggle, the consciousness of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants to study and apply Chairman Mao's works was raised, and the production enthusiasm of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants was promoted.

In supporting spring farming, the broad masses of soldiers and officers vigorously helped the communes and production brigades to establish and improve the leading cadres. In places where the leading cadres have not been established, they actively organized revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and Chairman Mao's policies on cadres, so that the revolutionary masses can correctly treat the cadres; the revolutionary cadres dare to come forward to revolution. In places where the leading cadres have been established, the soldiers and officers, together with the cadres, studied Chairman Mao's works, studied Vice Chairman Lin Biao's instructions on emphasizing proletarian politics, shouldered their bags and went down to the production teams, labored in the fields, and through word and deed, made the cadres learn to do political and ideological work, using the great Mao Zedong Thought to guide production.

In supporting spring farming, the broad masses of soldiers and officers vigorously mobilized the peasants to respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "learn from Dazhai in agriculture," extensively speaking about the revolutionary spirit of the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai who held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, had a heart for the motherland, and eyes for the world, were self-reliant, and strove hard. In the broad countryside, a mass movement of walking the Dazhai path, learning from the people of Dazhai, and promoting the Dazhai spirit was set off. The agricultural support troops of a certain unit in Taishan, Guangdong, when studying with the masses to overcome the difficulties in production, on the one hand, spoke extensively about the revolutionary spirit of the people of Dazhai, on the other hand, organized the commune members and cadres to recall the battle experiences of overcoming salt-alkali, drought, and typhoons in recent years, greatly enhancing their courage to take the initiative and overcome all difficulties. The masses braved the cold wind, built fields, leveled the ground, dug ponds to accumulate fertilizer, found their own ways, tapped their own potential, and overcame various difficulties.

In addition, the units in various places also provided a large amount of manpower and material support for the agricultural production front line. Some helped the production teams to repair agricultural machinery; some, together with the peasants, found fertilizer sources, repaired farm tools, and formulated production plans; some dispatched trucks, water pumps, and a large number of wheelbarrows to support local water conservancy projects, greatly promoting this year's spring farming.

    解放军广大指战员深入农村大力支援春耕生产
    他们以毛主席的最新指示为纲，积极帮助社员举办毛泽东思想学习班，活学活用毛主席著作，学习大寨的革命精神，广泛深入地开展革命大批判，促进基层单位建立和健全领导班子，使各地革命和生产出现热气腾腾的景象
    据新华社三十一日讯　人民解放军支农部队和支农的毛泽东思想宣传队，遵照毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的教导，入春以来，深入农村，支援春耕生产。广大指战员，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以毛主席最新指示为纲，积极帮助社员举办毛泽东思想学习班，活学活用毛主席著作；广泛发动社员开展革命大批判，提高他们的阶级斗争觉悟；帮助基层单位建立、健全领导班子，抓革命、促生产。在指战员的支援和帮助下，各地革命和生产都出现了热气腾腾的景象。
    在支农工作中作出很大成绩的广大指战员，春节以后，就积极做支援春耕的准备工作。许多部队党委专门作了研究部署，指定专人负责抓支援春耕的工作。春耕季节一到，指战员们立即行动起来，背起背包，奔赴生产第一线。驻华北地区某部指战员同县、区、公社的革命干部、革命群众组织代表，组成了十万人的“三结合”的毛泽东思想宣传队，分赴公社、大队和生产队。兰州部队派出一万五千多名干部战士，组成五百多个毛泽东思想宣传队，深入到一百一十多个县的公社和生产队。沈阳、济南部队各抽调一万多名指战员，加强支农的力量。广州、南京、武汉等部队，支援春耕热火朝天。驻海南岛某部干部战士和家属一齐出动，深入到黎族、苗族等村寨，帮助广大社员狠抓革命，猛促生产。
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”，指战员们一到农村，第一件事，就是向广大贫下中农宣传毛主席的最新指示，宣传伟大的毛泽东思想。他们说，千支援，万支援，帮助贫下中农和革命干部掌握毛泽东思想是最大的支援；千重要，万重要，用伟大的毛泽东思想统帅生产最重要。他们通过各种形式，组织社员学习毛主席著作，学习中央有关决定、通知。指战员们针对春耕生产中存在的各种问题，帮助群众举办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。南海前哨海军某部支农人员，在田头举办抓革命、促生产专题学习班，使广大群众认识到搞好春耕生产，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的重要一环。吉林伊通支农部队，在学习班里和社员们一起讨论：“去年丰收了，今年应该怎么做？”帮助一些社员克服了在成绩面前止步不前的情绪。有些部队还帮助公社分别举办民兵、干部学习班，更好地发挥他们在春耕中的突击作用和骨干作用。在支援春耕中，广大指战员经常同群众一起劳动，一起活学活用毛主席著作，一起开展革命大批判。海军直属部队派往北京市延庆县十二个公社的毛泽东思想宣传队，组织各种批判会，和群众一起批判了中国赫鲁晓夫和旧北京市委在农业上推行的修正主义路线。广西支农部队结合当地情况，同壮族贫下中农一起，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义谬论。空军某部人员以贫下中农在旧社会的血泪史为教材，同群众一起批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的“剥削有功”论。通过革命大批判，提高了广大贫下中农活学活用毛主席著作的自觉性，促进了广大贫下中农的生产积极性。
    在支援春耕生产中，广大指战员大力帮助公社、生产大队建立和健全领导班子。在领导班子没有建立起来的地方，他们积极组织革命群众和革命干部，学习毛主席的最新指示，学习毛主席的干部政策，使革命群众能正确地对待干部；革命干部勇敢地站出来革命。领导班子已经建立起来的地方，指战员又和干部们一起学习毛主席著作，学习林彪副主席关于突出无产阶级政治的指示，一起背上背包下生产队，一起下田劳动，通过口传身教，使干部学会做政治思想工作，用伟大的毛泽东思想统帅生产。
    广大指战员在支援春耕生产中，还大力发动农民响应毛主席“农业学大寨”的伟大号召，大讲大寨贫下中农高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，胸怀祖国，放眼世界，自力更生，艰苦奋斗的革命精神，在广大农村中掀起了一个走大寨路，学大寨人，兴大寨风的群众性的热潮。广东台山支农某部队，同群众研究克服生产中的困难时，一面大讲大寨人的革命精神，一面组织社员和干部回忆几年来战胜盐碱、旱涝和台风的战斗经历，大大提高了自己动手，克服一切困难的勇气。群众冒着寒风，垒田平地，挖塘积肥，自己想办法、挖潜力，克服了各种困难问题。
    此外，各地部队还为农业生产第一线提供了大量的人力物力的支援。有的帮助生产队抢修农业机械；有的和农民一起找肥源、修农具，制订生产计划；有的抽调汽车、抽水机和大批手推车，支援当地兴修水利，大大推动了今年的春耕生产。
