Chairman Mao has pointed the way forward for all the peoples of the world. The peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America must rise up and defeat American imperialism. The peoples of Asia and Africa enthusiastically acclaim Chairman Mao's statement and resolutely support Chairman Mao's statement.

The Battle Cry

A responsible person of the Political Committee of the Patriotic Armed Forces of the Western Front in the Congo (Kinshasa) said in a statement on the 18th that today, the extremely reactionary ruling clique of the United States has torn off its own mask and savagely assassinated the non-violent advocate Martin Luther King, playing a negative role in the revolutionary cause of American blacks.

He said, Chairman Mao stated in his 1963 statement "In Support of the American Negroes in Their Just Struggle Against Racial Discrimination by U.S. Imperialism": "The thoroughly evil system of colonialism and imperialism, which is rooted in the enslavement and trafficking of Negroes, will inevitably perish as the black people of the world achieve complete emancipation." Today, the struggle of American blacks is flourishing and shaking the world, which shows that the situation is developing in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao.

He pointed out: "At every decisive turning point, when the revolutionary people fighting for independence and freedom are at a critical moment, Chairman Mao has always stood on the side of the revolutionary oppressed people struggling for independence and freedom."

He went on to say: "Now, the great leader, great teacher, and great helmsman of the world revolution, Chairman Mao, with profound proletarian feelings of great concern and full trust for the broad masses of American blacks, with unparalleled wisdom and far-sighted vision, issued a statement of great historical significance on April 16, 1968, supporting and promoting the struggle of American blacks against the American monopoly bourgeoisie, pointing out a new direction for the struggle of American blacks against U.S. imperialism."

He said, the interests of the broad masses of white workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals in the United States are linked with those of the blacks. They must unite with the American blacks and fight, as Chairman Mao pointed out: "The struggle of the American Negroes is not only a struggle for freedom and liberation by the oppressed and exploited black people, but also a new call to arms for all the oppressed and exploited American people against the brutal rule of the monopoly bourgeoisie."

He said: "The people of the Congo (Kinshasa) fighting against the reactionary forces of the United States and the domestic reactionaries, in the revolutionary war, have received the support of their black brothers in the United States." He said, Chairman Mao's statement is a battle cry for the patriotic armed forces of the Western Front in the Congo (Kinshasa), providing them with an even more powerful ideological weapon.

Great Encouragement

The Deputy Secretary for External Affairs and Press Officer of the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania (South Africa), David Sibeko, said in a statement in Dar es Salaam on the 18th that Chairman Mao's statement is the greatest document analyzing the struggle of American blacks against violence from a Marxist-Leninist perspective. Chairman Mao's statement will certainly strengthen the resolve of American blacks and all freedom-loving peoples to fight for their just cause; at the same time, it will certainly plunge the entire imperialist camp led by the United States into deeper chaos, greatly diminishing their arrogance.

Sibeko said that all peoples fighting for freedom will draw great encouragement from Chairman Mao's statement. He also said that Chairman Mao's statement will further awaken the broad masses of laboring people among American whites, who share common interests and common goals with American blacks.

Finally, Sibeko shouted: "Down with U.S. imperialism and all its lackeys! Victory to all progressive forces in the world! Long live Chairman Mao!"

A Great Historical Document

The representative of the Congress Party in London, Morapo, told a Xinhua News Agency reporter that Chairman Mao's statement has great historical significance for the struggle of all peoples of the world against U.S. imperialism. He said that Chairman Mao's statement is a call to arms for all oppressed peoples of the world to rise up against U.S. imperialism and the reactionaries of all countries. He said that the brave struggle of American blacks against violence clearly shows that the revolutionary power of the American black revolution is growing stronger day by day. Morapo expressed his firm belief that the imperialist aggressors of the United States and all their lackeys will definitely be defeated by the oppressed peoples of the world.

Responding to Chairman Mao's Great Call

The Secretary-General of the Arab Lawyers Union, Sha'ban Al-Ashdat, pointed out: "Chairman Mao reaffirmed a great truth in his statement: armed struggle is the only way for revolutionary peoples to defeat imperialism. Martin Luther King's advocacy of non-violence did not save him from being killed. We Arabs firmly believe in what Chairman Mao said: 'The oppressed peoples and nations can never pin their hopes for liberation on the 'wisdom' of imperialism and its lackeys, but only through strengthening unity and persevering in struggle can they achieve victory.' We believe that the principle pointed out by Chairman Mao is completely applicable to our struggle. We do not believe in the United Nations manipulated by U.S. imperialism, nor do we believe in any so-called 'political solution to the Middle East problem.' As Chairman Mao has repeatedly pointed out, armed struggle is the only way for us to defeat our enemies—U.S. imperialism and its lackey Israel. We will continue to fight until we end imperialist aggression and completely liberate the occupied Palestinian territories."

Al-Ashdat said: "Under the great call of Chairman Mao Zedong, the revolutionary peoples of the world will intensify their struggle against imperialism led by the United States and strive for liberation. The days of U.S. imperialism are numbered."

The Palestinian freedom fighter Ali said: "Chairman Mao's recent statement is a great encouragement to the Palestinian people who are in the midst of struggle. We will continue our armed struggle, which is the only way to liberate the occupied Palestinian territories. We sincerely wish the great teacher Chairman Mao Zedong a long life!"

The news worker from the United Arab Republic, Muhammad, said: "We, the people of the United Arab Republic, have no hope for U.S. imperialism and its accomplices. The only correct way to solve the Middle East problem is to use revolutionary war to counter the counter-revolutionary war of the United States and Israel, and there is no other way."

The Chinese People Stand on Our Side

The representative of the Dhofar Liberation Front in Cairo, Yusuf Al-Ali Abdullah, said: "Chairman Mao's statement is a great support for the revolutionary struggles of American blacks and all peoples of the world. This clearly expresses Chairman Mao's great concern and resolute support for the struggle of the revolutionary peoples of the world against their common enemy, U.S. imperialism. This once again makes us feel that in our struggle, the great leader Chairman Mao and the great Chinese people under his leadership have always firmly stood on our side."

He said: "Chairman Mao expressed great revolutionary truths in simple language in the statement and pointed out the correct revolutionary path for the revolutionary peoples of the world. This will undoubtedly advance the world revolution. The revolutionary peoples of the world will achieve victory by following Chairman Mao's teachings."

He also said: "We have received strong support from China in our struggle. We will unite and strengthen our armed struggle, resist the British colonialism supported by U.S. imperialism occupying Dhofar, until we achieve final liberation. We firmly believe in Chairman Mao's teaching: 'The people of the whole world must have the courage to fight, dare to face difficulties, and advance bravely. In that case, the whole world will definitely belong to the people. All devils will be destroyed.'"

    毛主席给全世界人民指明了前进方向
    亚非拉人民行动起来打败美帝国主义
    亚非人民热烈欢呼毛主席声明坚决支持毛主席声明
    战斗的号角
    刚果（金）  爱国武装西线政治委员会的一位负责人十八日发表谈话说，今天，极端反动的美国统治集团撕下了它自己的假面具，野蛮地暗杀了非暴力主义者马丁·路德·金，对美国黑人革命事业起了反面教员的作用。
    他说，毛主席在一九六三年《支持美国黑人反对美帝国主义种族歧视的正义斗争的声明》中说：“万恶的殖民主义、帝国主义制度是随着奴役和贩卖黑人而兴盛起来的，它也必将随着黑色人种的彻底解放而告终。”今天，美国黑人斗争蓬勃发展，震撼世界，这表明形势是朝着毛主席所指出的方向发展的。
    他指出：“在每个决定性的转折关头，在争取解放和反对反动势力的革命人民处于关键的时刻，毛主席始终是站在为争取独立和自由而斗争的革命的被压迫人民一边。”
    他接着说：“现在，无产阶级的伟大领袖、伟大导师和世界革命的伟大舵手毛主席，怀着对广大美国黑人的巨大关怀和充分信任的深厚的无产阶级感情，以无与伦比的智慧，高瞻远瞩地在一九六八年四月十六日发表了具有伟大历史意义的声明，支持和促进美国黑人反对美国垄断资产阶级的斗争，为美国黑人反对美帝国主义的斗争指出了新方向。”
    他说，美国白人中广大的工人、农民和革命知识分子的利益是同黑人的利益联系在一起的。他们要获得解放，就必须同美国黑人联合起来，进行斗争，正如毛主席指出的：“美国黑人的斗争，不仅是被剥削、被压迫的黑人争取自由解放的斗争，而且是整个被剥削、被压迫的美国人民反对垄断资产阶级残暴统治的新号角。”
    他说：“同反动的美国势力和国内反动派进行斗争的刚果（金）人民，在革命战争中得到美国黑人兄弟的支持。”他说，毛主席这一声明对刚果（金）爱国武装西线战士是一个战斗的号角，给予他们以更加强大的思想武器。
　　巨大的鼓舞
　　阿扎尼亚（南非）　泛非主义者大会外事副书记和新闻负责人戴维·西贝科十八日在达累斯萨拉姆发表声明说，毛主席的声明，是对美国黑人抗暴斗争作出马克思列宁主义分析的最伟大的文件。毛主席的声明一定会加强美国黑人和一切爱好自由的人民为他们的正义事业而斗争的决心；同时一定会使以美国为首的整个帝国主义阵营更深地陷入混乱的泥沼，大灭了它们的威风。
    西贝科说，一切为自由而斗争的人民将从毛主席的声明中得到巨大的鼓舞。他还说，毛主席的声明将进一步唤起美国白人中的广大劳动人民，他们和美国黑人有着共同的利益和共同的斗争目标。
    最后，西贝科高呼：“打倒美帝国主义及其一切走狗！”“胜利属于世界上的一切进步力量！”“毛主席万岁！”
　　伟大的历史文件
　　巴苏陀兰　大会党驻伦敦代表莫拉波对新华社记者发表谈话指出，毛主席的声明，对全世界人民反对美帝国主义的斗争具有伟大的历史意义。他说，毛主席的声明是号召全世界一切被压迫人民奋起反对美帝国主义和各国反动派的号角。他说，美国黑人英勇的抗暴斗争清楚地表明，美国黑人革命的力量正在日益壮大。莫拉波表示深信，美帝国主义侵略者及其一切仆从，一定会被全世界被压迫人民打败。
　　响应毛主席伟大号召
　　阿拉伯　律师联合会秘书长沙·阿希达特指出：“毛主席在声明中重申了伟大的真理：暴力斗争是革命人民打败帝国主义的唯一道路。马丁·路德·金宣扬非暴力主义未能使他免于被杀害。我们阿拉伯人坚信毛主席所说的：‘被压迫人民和被压迫民族，决不能把自己的解放寄托在帝国主义及其走狗的“明智”上面，而只有通过加强团结、坚持斗争，才能取得胜利。’我们认为，毛主席指出的这一原则，完全适用于我们的斗争。我们不相信美帝国主义所操纵的联合国，也不相信任何所谓‘政治解决中东问题的办法’。正如毛主席一再指出的，武装斗争是我们打败我们的敌人——美帝国主义及其走狗以色列的唯一办法。我们要坚持斗争，直到结束帝国主义的侵略和彻底解放被占领的巴勒斯坦为止。”
    阿希达特说：“在毛泽东主席的伟大号召下，世界革命人民将加紧反对以美国为首的帝国主义，加紧争取解放的斗争。美帝国主义的日子是屈指可数了。”争取解放必须靠武装斗争巴勒斯坦自由战士阿里说：“毛主席最近发表的声明，对正在斗争中的巴勒斯坦人民是莫大的鼓舞。我们将继续进行武装斗争，这是我们解放被占领的巴勒斯坦的唯一道路。我们衷心祝愿伟大的导师毛泽东主席万寿无疆！”阿联新闻工作者穆罕默德说：“我们阿联人民对美帝国主义及其帮凶不抱任何希望。解决中东问题的唯一正确的途径，是用革命战争来对付美国—以色列的反革命战争，除此以外，是没有别的办法的。”
　　中国人民站在我们一边
　　佐法尔解放阵线　驻开罗代表优素福·阿勒维·阿卜杜拉说：“毛主席的声明，对于美国黑人和全世界人民的革命斗争是巨大的支持。这清楚地表达了毛主席对世界革命人民反对共同敌人美帝国主义的斗争的极大关怀和坚决声援。这使我们又一次感到，在我们的斗争中，伟大领袖毛泽东主席和他领导下的伟大中国人民始终坚决站在我们一边”。
    他说：“毛主席在声明中用朴素的语言表达了伟大的革命真理，并且为世界革命人民指出了正确的革命道路。这无疑将推进世界革命。全世界革命人民遵循毛主席的教导，必将取得胜利。”
    他还说：“我们在斗争中得到中国的大力支持。我们将团结起来，加强武装斗争，反对得到美帝国主义支持的英国殖民主义对佐法尔的占领，直到我们获得最后解放为止。我们坚信毛主席的教导：‘全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。’”
