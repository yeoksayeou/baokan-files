The Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee (Leftist Faction) of the Japanese Communist Party's organ newspaper *People's Star* published an editorial on April 20 stating that Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence points out a clear direction for the struggle of American blacks for freedom and liberation.

The editorial, titled "Responding to Chairman Mao's Great Call for a Prolonged and Ferocious Struggle," points out that Chairman Mao's statement is a new great contribution to the world revolution. This statement not only provides great support to American blacks in their struggle against racial discrimination by American imperialism but also greatly inspires all peoples of the world who are fighting against American imperialism.

The editorial says that Chairman Mao pointed out in his statement: "The thorough collapse of colonialism, imperialism, and all systems of exploitation, and the thorough emancipation of all oppressed peoples and nations, are not far off." This not only fully exposes the paper tiger nature of imperialism and all reactionaries but also teaches us to recognize the process of development of the world revolution.

The editorial says that in response to Chairman Mao's great call, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals in Japan, as well as all anti-American patriots, must take immediate action, further deepen the anti-American patriotic movement, and strongly support the struggle of American blacks against violence; we must raise the level of our struggle, and launch a prolonged and ferocious attack on American imperialism, the Japanese reactionaries, and the Soviet revisionists and the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist group led by Kyuichi Nambu.

The editorial concludes by saying that our current important task is: to strengthen the struggle against the revival of Japanese militarism by the American and Japanese reactionaries; to thoroughly smash the revisionist group led by Nambu that advocates the parliamentary road for the Japanese people and betrays the Vietnamese people; to expose the criminal activities of the Nambu group in collusion with the Soviet revisionists, serving the American imperialists' "peace talks" fraud in Vietnam.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on April 21, Tokyo: Revolutionary people in Japan enthusiastically hail Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence.

Representative Shiro Matsui of the Hyogo Prefecture Committee (Leftist Faction) of the Japanese Communist Party said: Chairman Mao's statement is a great Marxist-Leninist document. This statement not only points out the direction for the struggle of American blacks but also points out a broad and victorious path for the struggle of all oppressed peoples and nations for thorough liberation. Matsui expressed that the Hyogo Prefecture Committee (Leftist Faction) of the Japanese Communist Party will further study and propagate Chairman Mao's great statement, constantly arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, unite the broad masses of the Japanese people, adhere to proletarian internationalism, and fight to the end for the victory of the Japanese revolution and the thorough liberation of all oppressed peoples and nations in the world.

Secretary-General Masao Nakajima of the Hyogo Prefecture General Branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Orthodox) said: Chairman Mao's statement points out a clear direction for the struggle of peoples of all countries against American imperialism. Nakajima said: We must strengthen and expand the Japan-China friendship movement, unite more Japanese people, and launch a prolonged and ferocious attack on American imperialism and all enemies obstructing Japan-China friendship.

Secretary-General Tokiko Kasai of the Hyogo Prefecture General Branch of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Committee and a standing committee member of the Japan Committee for Afro-Asian People's Solidarity said: The Japanese people resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's battle call, persist in the ongoing anti-American patriotic struggle centered on opposing American military bases, and fiercely strike at American imperialism.

Kazuo Sekiguchi, chairman of the Hachioji branch of the Japan National Railways Workers' Union, who led Japanese workers in the struggle to refuse to transport oil for American military bases, said: Chairman Mao's statement points out the way for the liberation struggle of revolutionary peoples around the world. Sekiguchi expressed: We must organize the broad masses and further develop the struggle.

Masao Miyoka, who led farmers in Tachikawa to persist for thirteen years in the struggle against the expansion of the American military base in Ichikawa, said: Chairman Mao pointed out in his statement: "People of the world, unite more closely, and launch a prolonged and ferocious attack on our common enemy, American imperialism, and its lackeys!" This is a great call to us. Apart from this path, we have no other way to achieve thorough liberation.

    新华社二十日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本共产党山口县委员会（左派）机关报《人民之星》二十日发表社论说，毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明，给美国黑人争取自由解放的斗争指出了明确的前进方向。
    这篇题为《响应毛主席的伟大号召进行持久的猛烈的斗争》的社论指出，毛主席的声明是对世界革命的新的伟大贡献。这个声明不仅给反对美帝国主义种族歧视的美国黑人以极大的支持，而且给进行反美斗争的全世界人民以极大的鼓舞。
    社论说，毛主席在声明中指出：“殖民主义、帝国主义和一切剥削制度的彻底崩溃，世界上一切被压迫人民、被压迫民族的彻底翻身，已经为期不远了。”这不仅充分揭示了帝国主义和一切反动派的纸老虎本质，同时也教导我们认清了世界革命的发展进程。
    社论说，为了响应毛主席的伟大号召，日本的广大工人、农民和革命知识分子以及所有的反美爱国人士，必须立即行动起来，更深入地展开反美爱国运动，强有力地支持美国黑人的抗暴斗争；必须把我们的斗争水平提高一步，对美帝和日本反动派以及苏修和日共宫本修正主义集团，发动持久的猛烈的进攻。
    社论最后说，我们当前十分重要的任务是：加强反对美日反动派复活日本军国主义的斗争；彻底粉碎鼓吹日本人民走议会道路、背叛越南人民的日共宫本修正主义集团；揭露宫本集团同苏修相勾结，为美帝国主义在越南搞“和谈”骗局效劳的罪恶活动。
    据新华社二十一日讯　东京消息：日本革命人民热烈欢呼毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明。
    日本共产党兵库县委员会（左派）代表松井志郎说：伟大领袖毛主席的声明是一个伟大的马克思列宁主义的文献，这个声明不仅给美国黑人斗争指出了前进的方向，而且给全世界一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民争取彻底解放的斗争指出了一条胜利的宽阔的大道。松井表示：日本共产党兵库县委员会（左派）要进一步学习和宣传毛主席的伟大声明，不断地用毛泽东思想武装自己，团结日本广大人民，坚持无产阶级国际主义，为日本革命的胜利和世界上一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族的彻底解放而斗争到底。
    日中友好协会（正统）兵库县总部事务局长中岛正夫说：毛主席的声明给世界各国人民反对美帝国主义的斗争指出了明确的方向。中岛说：我们要加强和扩大日中友好运动，团结更广大的日本人民，向美帝国主义和一切阻碍日中友好的敌人进行持久的猛烈的进攻。
    亚非人民团结日本委员会常任理事、亚非人民团结日本委员会兵库县总部事务局长加濑都贵子说：日本人民坚决响应毛主席的战斗号召，把正在进行的以反对美军基地为中心的反美爱国斗争，持久地坚持下去，猛烈地打击美帝国主义。
    曾经领导日本工人拒绝为美军基地运输汽油斗争的日本国营铁路工会八王子分会主席关口和说：毛主席的声明给全世界革命人民的解放斗争指明了道路。关口表示：我们必须把广大群众组织起来，进一步开展斗争。
    领导东京砂川农民坚持十三年反对美军扩建立川基地斗争的宫冈政雄说：毛主席在声明中指出：“全世界人民更紧密地团结起来，向着我们的共同敌人美帝国主义及其帮凶们发动持久的猛烈的进攻！”这是对我们的伟大号召。除了这条道路以外，我们没有别的获得彻底解放的道路。
