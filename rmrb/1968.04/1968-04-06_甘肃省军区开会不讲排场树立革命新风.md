The Chinese People's Liberation Army Gansu Provincial Military Region has earnestly implemented Chairman Mao's great directive to "be thrifty and make revolution." They have carried forward the glorious tradition of hard struggle, choosing to stay in barracks instead of hotels, not setting up reception personnel, and doing everything themselves. The meeting was filled with a spirit of unity, tension, seriousness, and liveliness. Everyone praised it as a revolutionary meeting.

This conference was the largest gathering of activists who study Chairman Mao's works since the establishment of the Gansu Provincial Military Region. Originally, it was planned to be held in two relatively well-equipped hotels in Lanzhou. Later, the Party Committee discovered that the cost of staying in hotels was too high and did not align with Chairman Mao's teaching of "being thrifty and making revolution." They decided not to stay in hotels but to hold the meeting in military barracks. Although the conditions were somewhat inferior, it saved the nation a significant amount of money. Many comrades pointed out that in the past, leading organs holding meetings had fostered a bad habit of emphasizing pomp and showing off wealth. This meeting should seize the opportunity of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to break with the old and establish the new, achieving revolutionization.

After this decision was made, the conference preparatory personnel and military region cadre enthusiastically supported it. Everyone worked together to inspect the barracks arranged for the representatives' accommodation. Some rooms had poor electrical wiring, so they fixed it themselves; walls and ceilings needed repairs, so they painted and papered them themselves; the kitchen needed a large stove, so they modified it. Nearby brother units, upon hearing that this meeting would not stay in hotels but in barracks, also actively provided strong support, quickly completing all preparatory work.

This meeting also broke with past practices, not renting public buses or luxurious conference halls. Evening performances were held outdoors with movie screenings or invited amateur troupes from relevant units. The comrades in charge of logistics also economized in every way, reducing unnecessary expenses. Thus, the conference expenditure was only one-fourth of the original budget.

During the conference, the representatives and staff all brought their own luggage. Leaders and representatives ate, lived, and studied together. Everyone worked together to fetch water, sweep the floor, and maintain environmental hygiene, caring for, helping, and assisting each other. This filled the meeting with a spirit of unity, tension, seriousness, and liveliness. The representatives deeply felt that this meeting was a good study session, a grand classroom for implementing Chairman Mao's latest directives. The method of not staying in hotels, not setting up reception personnel, and not emphasizing pomp should be widely promoted.

    甘肃省军区开会不讲排场树立革命新风
    他们认真执行毛主席“要节约闹革命”的伟大指示，发扬艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，不住饭店住营房，不设招待员，一切自己动手，会议充满团结、紧张、严肃、活泼的气氛
    新华社兰州五日电　中国人民解放军甘肃省军区认真执行毛主席“要节约闹革命”的伟大指示，发扬艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，在召开第二次学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会时不住饭店住营房，不设招待员，不讲究排场，一切自己动手。大家称赞这是一次革命化的会议。
    这次大会，是甘肃省军区成立以来召开的规模最大的一次学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会，原计划在兰州市两家设备较好的饭店举行。后来，党委发现住饭店开会开支太大，不符合毛主席“要节约闹革命”的教导，决定不住饭店，在部队营房举行。这样条件虽然差些，但可为国家节省开支。许多同志指出，过去，领导机关召开会议，滋长了一种讲排场、比阔气的不良作风，这次会议应当借无产阶级文化大革命的东风，破旧立新，实现革命化。
    这个决定作出后，立即得到会议筹备人员和军区机关干部的积极支持，大家齐心合力检查了安排代表住宿的营房。有些房子电灯线路不好，就自己动手安装；墙壁和顶棚需要修缮，就自己动手粉刷和裱糊；食堂需要大炉灶，他们就去改建。邻近的兄弟部队听到这次会议不住饭店住营房，也主动给予大力支援，很快做好了一切筹备工作。
    这次会议还打破以往惯例，不租用公共汽车，不租用阔气的会议厅。举办晚会时，在露天放映电影或请有关单位的业余剧团演出。担任总务工作的同志也处处精打细算，减少不必要的开支。这样，使会议经费开支只用了原来预算的四分之一。
    会议期间，参加会议的代表和工作人员，都自带行李。领导干部和代表们吃在一起，住在一起，学习在一起。大家共同打水、扫地、搞环境卫生，互相关怀，互相照顾，互相帮助，使会议充满团结、紧张、严肃、活泼的气氛。代表们深有感触地说：这次会议是一次很好的学习班，是落实毛主席最新指示的大课堂。会议不住饭店、不设招待员、不讲排场，这种革命化的开会方法应该大力提倡。
