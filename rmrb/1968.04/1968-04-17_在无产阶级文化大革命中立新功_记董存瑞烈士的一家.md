In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the family of martyr Dong Cunrui of Nan Mountain Village, Cunrui Commune, Huailai County, Hebei Province, has stood new merits. The family of six, with the martyr's father, Dong Quanzhong, as the leader of the production brigade, and his younger brother, Dong Cunjin, as the vice chairman of the revolutionary committee of the commune and a member of the county and regional revolutionary committees, is also an active learner of Chairman Mao's works in the Beijing Military Region and the county.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they followed the great teacher Chairman Mao's instruction, "You must pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end," and actively participated in the Cultural Revolution. They held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely fought against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in the village who had not been reformed.

The great teacher Chairman Mao taught us: "To hold study classes is a good method. Many problems can be solved in study classes." With boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to the great teacher Chairman Mao, they actively participated in the study classes of Mao Zedong Thought organized by the militia company, brigade, and production team, and also set up a family study class. The whole family used Chairman Mao's "Three Articles" as a weapon and "Criticize and Repudiate Revisionism and Criticize and Repudiate the Self" as the guideline to launch a revolution in the depths of their souls, turning the family study class into a battlefield for criticizing and repudiating revisionism and the self.

For a period, the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in the village who had not been reformed attempted to restore capitalism. Some openly cursed socialism, some engaged in superstitious activities, some led gambling and stole the production team's grain, and some brazenly sought revenge. Seeing this, Dong Cunjin brought the problems to the family study class to study Chairman Mao's statements on class and class struggle. Chairman Mao's ten golden characters, "Never forget class struggle," shone brightly in his mind. He also recalled Chairman Mao's teaching: "The people rely on us to organize. The reactionaries in China rely on us to organize the people to overthrow them. Whatever is reactionary, if you do not overthrow it, it will not fall. This is also like sweeping the floor; where the broom does not reach, the dust will not disappear by itself." Chairman Mao's teachings, like timely rain, moistened his heart. Dong Cunjin's resolve to fight against the class enemy became even stronger. Soon, a battle to expose and criticize the class enemy, with the core militia as the backbone, was launched, quickly repelling the class enemy's arrogant attacks.

Due to the lingering poison of the bourgeois reactionary line of striking one and intimidating many by the Chinese Khrushchev, many production team cadres had the idea of changing shifts. Some bad elements tried to take advantage of the situation to bring down the production team cadres and install their own confidants. Thus, with the spring plowing season approaching, the cadre issues of two teams had not been resolved. Dong Cunjin focused his main energy on doing ideological work with the county revolutionary committee's Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team. The team leader of the first production team, Dong Wanhai, did not want to be a cadre. Dong Cunjin visited him three times to do ideological work, but each time he met with rebuffs. Chairman Mao taught us: "Class struggle, once grasped, is effective." Therefore, he followed Chairman Mao's teaching, inspiring Dong Wanhai to recall the past when he worked as a long-term laborer for the landlord, eating and dressing poorly, living a life worse than cattle and horses, greatly arousing the class feelings of Dong Wanhai and his family. Dong Wanhai's thoughts were straightened out, and he happily took up the cadre's responsibilities. Now, the cadre issues of the entire brigade have basically been resolved.

In the past, Old Man Dong Quanzhong thought that he was old and uneducated, and had the idea of slacking off in studying Chairman Mao's works. After criticizing and repudiating the self in the family study class, Old Man Dong, with boundless class feelings of love for the great teacher Chairman Mao, said: "Chairman Mao is a few years older than me and works day and night for the Chinese people and the people of the world. My idea of slacking off is the greatest disloyalty to Chairman Mao. In the future, I will study Chairman Mao's works until old age, follow Chairman Mao until old age, criticize and repudiate the self until old age, criticize and repudiate revisionism until old age, and my red heart loyal to Chairman Mao will never grow old."

    在无产阶级文化大革命中立新功
    ——记董存瑞烈士的一家
    河北省怀来县存瑞公社南山堡大队董存瑞烈士的家，是在无产阶级文化大革命中立了新功的一家。全家六口人，烈士的父亲董全忠老大爷是大队领导班子的负责人；弟弟董存金，是公社革命委员会副主任、县和地区的革命委员会委员，他还是北京军区和县的学习毛主席著作积极分子。
    在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，他们全家遵照伟大导师毛主席“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的教导，积极参加了文化大革命，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和村子里没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，进行了坚决的斗争。
    伟大导师毛主席教导我们：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”他们怀着对伟大导师毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的阶级感情，积极参加了民兵连、大队和生产队办的毛泽东思想学习班，同时也办了家庭学习班。他们全家以毛主席的“老三篇”为武器，以“斗私，批修”为纲，在灵魂深处爆发革命，把家庭学习班变成了斗私批修的战场。
    有一个时期，村子里没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子妄图进行资本主义复辟，有的公开咒骂社会主义，有的搞迷信活动，带头赌博和偷窃生产队的粮食，还有的明目张胆地反攻倒算。董存金看到这种情况，就带着问题在家庭学习班里学习毛主席有关阶级、阶级斗争的论述。毛主席的“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”十个金色大字，在他脑海里闪闪发光。他又想起毛主席的教导：“人民靠我们去组织。中国的反动分子，靠我们组织起人民去把他打倒。凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。这也和扫地一样，扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。”毛主席的教导，象及时雨，滋润着他的心田。董存金对阶级敌人斗争的决心更加坚强了。接着，一个以基干民兵为骨干的向阶级敌人发动的大揭露、大批判的战斗打响了，很快打退了阶级敌人的猖狂进攻。
    由于中国赫鲁晓夫的打击一大片的资产阶级反动路线的流毒没有肃清，有不少生产队干部有换班思想。有的坏人想乘机把生产队干部搞垮，安插他们的心腹。这样，眼看着春耕大忙就要开始，有两个队的干部问题还没有解决。董存金就集中主要精力和县革委会毛泽东思想宣传队一起作干部的思想工作。第一生产队队长董万海不愿当干部，董存金三次登门做工作，但是都碰了钉子。毛主席教导我们：“阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”于是，他就按照毛主席的教导，启发董万海回忆了过去给地主当长工，吃不饱穿不暖，过着牛马不如的生活的苦，大大激发了董万海一家人的阶级感情。董万海思想通了，愉快地挑起了干部的担子。现在，全大队的干部问题基本得到了解决。
    董全忠老大爷过去认为，自己岁数大了，又没文化，对学习毛主席著作有松劲思想。经过家庭学习班斗私，董大爷怀着对伟大导师毛主席无限热爱的阶级感情说：“毛主席比我还大几岁，日夜为中国人民、世界人民操劳。我有松劲思想，是对毛主席最大的不忠。今后，我要学习毛主席著作学到老，紧跟毛主席跟到老，斗私斗到老，批修批到老，忠于毛主席的红心永不老。”    （吕岐  莘秉瑞）
