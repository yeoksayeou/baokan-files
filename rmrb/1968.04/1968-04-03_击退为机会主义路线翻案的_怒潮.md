Title: Defeating the "Tidal Wave" of Reversing the Opportunist Line

The reactionary film "Tidal Wave" is a poisonous weed planted to erect a monument for the traitorous military conspirator Peng Dehuai. This film madly opposes Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and sings praises for Peng Dehuai's opportunist line.

The filmmakers exaggeratedly depict the "victory" of attacking cities when the enemy is strong and we are weak, to glorify the "leftist" opportunist line. The film describes a group led by Luo Dacheng and Qiu Jin, who, after annihilating an enemy company, immediately attack Liujia Bridge. At that time, Luo Dacheng boasted, "Now we have more people and more guns." The filmmakers describe this group as neither organizing the masses nor arming them, nor establishing a revolutionary base. They rely solely on the so-called "more people and more guns" to capture the heavily guarded city of Liujia Bridge. Later, when Qiu Jin heard the recently surrendered Nationalist staff officer Huang Weiguo say, "The city is very empty," he, without any investigation or research, immediately decided to take the risky action of "storming the city." The filmmakers elaborately describe how this group, under Qiu Jin's "correct" leadership, adopts the tactic of "attacking from both inside and outside," using spears to fight the enemy head-on, and easily captures the city, killing the reactionary warlord Yan Zijian and the evil landlord Liu Ruifu, thus advancing the revolution to a new stage of victory.

Why do the filmmakers go to such lengths to whitewash the "leftist" adventurist line? After the "Peng Dehuai Incident," Peng Dehuai had been promoting the "leftist" adventurist line, leading his troops to attack cities and causing significant losses to the revolution. However, Peng Dehuai's accomplice and the main filmmaker of the film, in order to sing praises for his master, on one hand, uses Luo Dacheng and Qiu Jin to embody Peng Dehuai's spirit, and in some scenes of Qiu Jin attacking cities, directly draws from Peng Dehuai's stories; on the other hand, distorts the facts, turning failures into victories. The film, through these descriptions, attempts to make people believe that the opportunist line promoted by Peng Dehuai and his ilk is the path to the success of the Chinese revolution. The filmmakers use such despicable methods to madly oppose Chairman Mao's correct revolutionary line of surrounding the cities from the countryside and seizing political power by force, a line that has been proven by history to be the only correct path.

Even more sinister and malicious is that the filmmakers fabricated a scene where Su Dasi brings a supposed "reply letter" from Comrade Mao, which incites Luo Dacheng and Qiu Jin to rashly attack the city. This is a malicious rumor, openly slandering and attacking our great leader Chairman Mao, truly reaching the height of shamelessness!

The filmmakers' beautification of the opportunist line is not only an attempt to rehabilitate the traitorous military conspirator Peng Dehuai, who was dismissed at the Lushan Conference, but also to peddle the anti-party goods of the Chinese Khrushchev. Long ago, the Chinese Khrushchev had been raging against Chairman Mao's great strategic thought of surrounding the cities from the countryside. He shouted, "Whether the revolution's victory comes from the cities to the countryside or from the countryside to the cities, the result is the same. This is not a principle issue." Nonsense! This is pure nonsense. If the Chinese revolution had not been under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, taking the path of surrounding the cities from the countryside, could we have achieved national victory? If we had followed the Wang Ming line that you, Chinese Khrushchev, and your agents like Peng Dehuai had been passionately advocating, where would today's socialist China be?

Decades later, the screen again shows the reactionary film "Tidal Wave," openly rehabilitating the opportunist line that has long been proven wrong in history. This is not accidental. This is the filmmakers following in the footsteps of the Chinese Khrushchev, stirring up a counter-revolutionary restoration "tidal wave"!

We, the soldiers of the proletarian revolution who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, must rise up with the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of beating fallen dogs, and defeat this "tidal wave" of rehabilitating Peng Dehuai, defeat this "tidal wave" of rehabilitating the opportunist line, defeat this "tidal wave" of restoring capitalism!

    击退为机会主义路线翻案的“怒潮”
    海军航空兵某部一等功荣立者　陈武录
    反动影片《怒潮》是一株为反党篡军的大野心家彭德怀树碑立传的大毒草。这部影片疯狂地反对毛主席的革命路线，为彭德怀一贯推行的机会主义路线大唱赞歌。
    影片的炮制者，极力渲染在敌强我弱的情况下，冒险进攻城市的“胜利”场面，来大肆吹捧“左”倾机会主义路线。影片描写罗大成、邱金领导的一支人马，在消灭敌人一个连之后，就马上去攻打刘家桥。当时罗大成吹嘘说：“现在我们人多，枪多”。炮制者描写这支队伍，既不组织群众、武装群众，也不建立革命根据地，只靠着所谓“人多，枪多”，便一举而攻下敌人警备森严的重镇刘家桥。后来，邱金听到刚刚投诚过来的国民党参谋黄维国说“城内非常空虚”时，他不加丝毫的调查和研究，便断然采取“扑城”的冒险行动。影片的炮制者大肆铺叙这支队伍在邱金的“正确”领导下，如何采取“内外夹攻”的战术，拿着梭标去跟敌人硬拚，居然能够轻而易举地攻克城市，打死了反动军阀阎紫剑和恶霸地主刘瑞甫，使革命走向胜利发展的新阶段。
    影片的炮制者为什么这样煞费苦心地为“左”倾冒险主义路线涂脂抹粉？彭德怀在“平江反水”后，当时推行的就是“左”倾冒险主义路线，他曾经带领部队去攻打城市，给革命造成了不少损失。但是彭德怀的死党、影片的主要炮制者，为了替主子歌“功”颂“德”，他一方面通过罗大成、邱金去寄托彭德怀的阴魂，并在邱金攻打城市的若干情节中，直接取材于彭德怀的故事；另一方面则歪曲事实，把失败写成了胜利。影片通过这些描写，妄图使人相信：彭德怀之流所推行的机会主义的路线是使中国革命取得成功的道路。影片的炮制者就用这种卑鄙的手法，疯狂地反对毛主席的以农村包围城市，武装夺取政权，这条已被历史证明了的唯一正确的革命路线。
    更加阴险恶毒的是，影片炮制者捏造了一个苏大嫂带来一封毛委员的所谓“回信”，才使得罗大成、邱金一哄而起，盲目攻城。这完全是恶毒造谣，公然诬蔑和攻击我们伟大领袖毛主席，真是无耻到了极点！
    影片的炮制者极力美化机会主义路线，不仅是妄图为在庐山会议上被罢了官的篡军反党分子彭德怀翻案；而且也是在贩卖中国赫鲁晓夫的反党私货。很早以前，中国赫鲁晓夫就猖狂地反对毛主席的以农村包围城市的伟大战略思想。他叫嚷什么：“革命的胜利，是从城市到农村，还是从农村到城市，其结果都是一样，这不是原则问题”。呸！这纯粹是胡说八道。中国革命如果不是在毛主席的英明领导下，走以农村包围城市的道路，能够夺取全国的胜利吗？如果依照你中国赫鲁晓夫和你的代理人彭德怀之流所狂热鼓吹的王明路线去干，哪里会有今天的社会主义中国呢！
    事隔几十年的今天，银幕上又出现了为彭德怀树碑立传的反动影片《怒潮》，公然为历史上早已破产的机会主义路线翻案，这决不是偶然的。这是影片的炮制者紧步中国赫鲁晓夫的后尘，掀起的一股反革命复辟的“怒潮”！
    我们无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命战士，一定要奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，发扬痛打落水狗的革命精神，击退这股为彭德怀翻案的“怒潮”，击退这股为机会主义路线翻案的“怒潮”，击退这股复辟资本主义的“怒潮”！
