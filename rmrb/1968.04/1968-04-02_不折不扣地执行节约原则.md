We strictly implement the principle of economy by replacing the main switchboard with individual phones.

Our company has installed a fifty-line main switchboard, with a monthly fee of 130 yuan. Some comrades suggested that we should start from the perspective of economy. A unit with fewer than 100 people and a small area does not need a main switchboard. It is sufficient to install individual phones in a few key departments. However, some comrades disagreed, believing that having a main switchboard and individual phones in each department means that when a call comes in, there is no need to shout for people. Everyone repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings and resolutely followed his great directive to "further economize and make revolution." We adopted the first suggestion, dismantled the main switchboard, and kept only three individual phones in three key departments. This saves 91 yuan in monthly expenses.

Walking to the meeting.

One day, the company's employees were going to attend a meeting. According to the old routine, a car was arranged to pick them up. At this time, some comrades proposed: Chairman Mao teaches us, "Every place must cherish manpower and materials to the utmost." We must strictly follow this. The leadership listened to everyone's opinions and felt it was correct, immediately announcing: "The car will not be used; we will walk to the meeting."

Doing it ourselves.

Recently, the company accepted a task to transport minerals. A few driver comrades discussed: The minerals cause significant wear and tear on the car body. If the car body's bottom is not reinforced, it will be worn out after a short period of transportation, and a new one will cost over 500 yuan. For three trucks, it would cost over 1,500 yuan. If the car body is sent to the repair shop for reinforcement, it would still cost over 200 yuan for three trucks, and the time cannot be guaranteed. What should we do? Just as they were wondering, Chairman Mao's great teaching to "further economize and make revolution" enlightened them, and they unanimously said: "We will do it ourselves!" They immediately bought nails and iron plates and quickly reinforced the bottoms of the three trucks. This not only saved expenses but also ensured the transportation time.

### 不折不扣地执行节约原则

    不折不扣地执行节约原则
        总机换单机
    我们公司安装有一部五十门的总机，月费一百三十元。有些同志提出，应从节约出发，一个不到一百人的单位，范围又不大，没有必要安装总机，只要在几个主要部门安上单机就行了。可有些同志不同意，认为有个总机，各科室还有个单机，来了电话就不要来回喊人了。大家反复学习了毛主席的教导，坚决按毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大指示办事，采纳了前一种意见，撤销了总机，只在三个主要科室留下了三个单机。每月节约开支九十一元。
          步行前往
    有一天，公司职工要去开会，照老规矩安排了汽车接送。这时，有的同志提出：毛主席教导我们，“任何地方必须十分爱惜人力物力”，我们要不折不扣地照办。领导上听了大家的意见，觉得很对，马上宣布：“汽车不开了，步行前往。”
          自己动手
    最近，公司接受了一项运输矿石的任务。几个司机同志议论说：矿石对车厢的磨损很大，如果不加固车厢底板，运不了多久，就会把车厢磨坏。坏了再做一个新的，就得花五百多元，三辆汽车就得花一千五百多元。如果把车厢送到修理厂去加固，三辆车也得花两百多元，而且时间不能保证。怎么办呢？正在为难的时候，毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大教导，照亮了他们的心，他们异口同声地说：“自己动手！”说干就干，他们买了元钉和铁板，很快地把三辆汽车的车厢底板加固好了，既节约了开支，又保证了运输时间。
