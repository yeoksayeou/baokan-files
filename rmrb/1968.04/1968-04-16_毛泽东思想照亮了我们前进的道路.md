During the three-year period of temporary difficulties, the Chinese Khrushchev, in order to promote the "three freedoms and one contract," spread a counter-revolutionary wind of individual farming, and attempted to restore capitalism. He maliciously spread the lie that "during the transitional period, any method that can mobilize the peasants' enthusiasm for production is good, and we should not say which method is the best." According to his words, the collective economy of the people's communes cannot mobilize the peasants' enthusiasm for production, the socialist system cannot mobilize the peasants' enthusiasm for production, and the great Mao Zedong Thought cannot mobilize the peasants' enthusiasm for production. Only his "three freedoms and one contract," individual farming, and the capitalist methods of "work points as the commander" can truly mobilize the peasants' enthusiasm for production. His words not only maliciously slandered us poor and lower-middle peasants but also brazenly attacked the socialist system and the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

Great Leader Chairman Mao has long said: "The masses have boundless enthusiasm for socialism." He also taught us that politics is the commander, the soul. The great Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding ideology for us laboring people to rise up and make revolution, representing our fundamental interests. As long as we poor and lower-middle peasants study and apply Chairman Mao's works, Mao Zedong Thought will take deep root in our hearts. Mao Zedong Thought is like a golden key that opens our minds, making us clear-sighted and bright, guiding our boundless enthusiasm for socialism, making it inexhaustible and limitless, transforming people and changing the earth, creating miracles beyond imagination. Therefore, what truly mobilizes the peasants' socialist enthusiasm for production? The answer is only to emphasize proletarian politics and rely on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Our brigade is a small village at the foot of the Great Wall, with only forty-three households and 262 people, scattered across nine small hills. We have only 186 mu of land, divided into more than a thousand plots, all sandy and stony, prone to both drought and waterlogging. In the past, the "three freedoms and one contract" and the black wind of "work points as the commander" that the Chinese Khrushchev spread also blew into our village. At that time, because we did not study Chairman Mao's works and did not firmly resist, we suffered losses and were deceived, making it impossible for the poor and lower-middle peasants to fully display their socialist enthusiasm. In the latter half of 1965, the People's Liberation Army responded to Chairman Mao's great call and helped us carry out the Four Clean-ups movement. The soldiers brought us the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the revolutionary spirit of Dazhai. A movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works vigorously unfolded. Since then, our Red Stone Gate Brigade has undergone a great transformation!

Our brigade started studying Chairman Mao's works in the fall of 1965. We established a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team and organized the more than forty households scattered across nine small hills into seven study groups for Chairman Mao's works. For more than two years, we have persisted in studying without interruption, regardless of rain or shine. Most of the poor and lower-middle peasants over thirty years old are illiterate, but they have memorized Chairman Mao's teachings and put them into practice. Through studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, they have thoroughly criticized the bourgeois "self" and established the proletarian "public." Selfless deeds are countless. The brigade set up a "Book of Honor" to commend selfless revolutionary spirit, but everyone only records others' merits and never mentions their own. If they find their names recorded, they immediately erase them. In the end, the "Book of Honor" was filled with a volume of glorious deeds, but there were hardly any names. This is how the poor and lower-middle peasants of our Red Stone Gate Brigade do not seek fame or profit but only strive for socialism and communism.

Our natural conditions are poor, but after the poor and lower-middle peasants studied Chairman Mao's works, they established the idea of farming for the revolution and became enthusiastic about transforming nature. They proudly said, "We do not believe in heaven, we do not believe in earth, we believe only in Chairman Mao!" In more than two years, we responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "learn from Dazhai in agriculture," self-reliant and arduous, with iron shoulders and strong hands, contributing more than 11,000 workdays. We blasted and moved 2,200 cubic meters of stone, moved 24,800 cubic meters of earth, built 108 dams, reclaimed 38 mu of land, and forced heaven to produce 34,000 jin more grain. We also built a five-li-long mountain road and returned 2,000 mu of land to forestry and afforestation. In the struggle to change heaven and earth, the most important achievement is the change in the spiritual state of the community members. The poor and lower-middle peasants said, "We want to be the masters of the 'public' and not the slaves of the 'self'." Now, the Chinese Khrushchev's "three freedoms and one contract" and the black methods of "work points as the commander" have become rats crossing the street in front of us poor and lower-middle peasants, with everyone shouting to beat them!

"Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." With the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, we have a soul, a direction, and boundless power. We will rely on Mao Zedong Thought to liberate all of humanity!

### 毛泽东思想照亮了我们前进的道路

    毛泽东思想照亮了我们前进的道路
    平谷县靠山集公社红石门大队
    在三年暂时困难时期，中国赫鲁晓夫为了推行“三自一包”，大刮单干风，复辟资本主义，就大造反革命舆论，胡说什么“过渡时期一切有利于调动农民生产积极性的办法都可以，不要说那一种办法是最好的。”按照他的说法，人民公社集体经济不能调动农民的生产积极性，社会主义制度不能调动农民的生产积极性，伟大的毛泽东思想，也不能调动农民的生产积极性；只有靠他那一套“三自一包”，靠单干、工分挂帅等资本主义的邪门歪道才能调动起农民的生产积极性。他这黑话不光是恶毒污蔑了我们贫下中农，而且还猖狂地攻击社会主义制度，攻击伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    伟大领袖毛主席早就说过：“群众中蕴藏了一种极大的社会主义的积极性。”并且教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂。伟大的毛泽东思想就是指引咱们劳动人民翻身闹革命的思想，代表着咱们的最根本的利益。咱们贫下中农只要活学活用毛主席著作，毛泽东思想就能够在我们心中深深扎下根来。毛泽东思想好比一把金钥匙，打开我们的心窍，使我们心明眼亮，把我们蕴藏着的极大的社会主义积极性引导出来，使不尽，用不完，让我们人变思想地换装，什么人间奇迹都能创造出来。因此，真正调动农民群众的社会主义生产积极性靠什么？唯一的就是靠突出无产阶级政治，靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想！
    我们大队是长城岭下的一个小山村，只有四十三户，二百六十二人，散住在九个小山包里。总共才有一百八十六亩地，还分割成一千多块，都是砂石土，既怕旱又怕涝。过去，中国赫鲁晓夫刮的“三自一包”和工分挂帅的黑风，也曾吹到我们这里，当时由于我们没有大学毛主席著作，没有坚决顶住，吃了亏，上了当，使贫下中农的社会主义积极性不能好好发挥出来。一九六五年下半年人民解放军响应毛主席的伟大号召，帮助我们开展四清运动来了。子弟兵给我们带来了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，带来了大寨人的革命精神。一个活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来了。从此，我们红石门大队大变样了！
    我们大队从一九六五年秋后就大学毛主席著作，成立了毛泽东思想宣传队，把散居在九个小山包里的四十多户社员组成了七个毛主席著作炕头学习班。两年多来，雷打不动，风雨无阻，始终如一地坚持学习。三十岁开外的贫下中农，差不多都不识字，但他们硬是凭着耳听脑记，把毛主席的教导刻在心坎上，落实在行动中。他们通过活学活用毛主席著作，大破资产阶级“私”字，大立无产阶级“公”字，一心为公的好人好事就简直数也数不清。大队为了表扬一心为公的革命精神，立了一个“光荣簿”，可是，谁都光记别人的功劳，就是不谈自己，并且发现别人记上自己的名字就马上涂掉，到头来，“光荣簿”上记满了一本子光荣事迹，却找不到几个人的名字。我们红石门大队贫下中农就是这样不为名，不为利，一心只为社会主义、共产主义。
    我们这里自然条件差，但是，贫下中农学了毛主席著作，树立了为革命种田的思想，改造自然的干劲就高涨起来了。他们自豪地说：“不信天，不信地，一心信仰毛主席！”两年多来，我们响应毛主席“农业学大寨”的伟大号召，自力更生，艰苦奋战，用一副副铁肩膀，一双双硬手掌，付出一万一千多个劳动日，劈山开石两千二百多立米，运土两万四千八百多立米，垒起一百零八道坝，垫地三十八亩，责令天公多献出三万四千多斤粮。我们还修起一条五里长的沿山公路，还退耕还林、封山育林两千多亩。在改天换地的斗争中，更重要的成就是社员精神状态的变化。贫下中农社员说：“我们要做‘公’字的主人，不做‘私’字的奴隶。”如今，中国赫鲁晓夫的“三自一包”和工分挂帅那一套黑货，在我们贫下中农面前，已经成了过街老鼠，人人喊打！
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”有了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，我们就有了灵魂，有了方向，就有了无穷无尽的力量。我们就是要靠毛泽东思想去解放全人类！
