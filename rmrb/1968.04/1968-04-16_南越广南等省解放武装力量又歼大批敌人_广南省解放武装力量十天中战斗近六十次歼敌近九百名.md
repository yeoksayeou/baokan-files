Liberation forces in South Vietnam's Quang Nam, Quang Tri, My Tho, Binh Dinh, and Long An provinces have annihilated large numbers of enemy troops in recent battles.

The liberation forces in the northern part of Quang Nam province engaged in nearly sixty battles from April 1 to April 10, killing, wounding, and capturing nearly nine hundred enemy troops (including nearly four hundred and seventy American invaders and one hundred South Korean mercenaries, completely annihilating four enemy platoons and eight squads). They also shot down and damaged eighteen aircraft, destroyed thirty military vehicles, destroyed ten cannons and mortars, demolished fourteen bunkers, blew up three bridges, and burned down three fuel depots, ammunition depots, and military supply warehouses.

On April 13, the liberation forces in Quang Tri province engaged in a brief battle in the Yu Linh area, completely annihilating a company of puppet troops. That afternoon, the enemy sent three more companies of puppet troops, supported by aircraft and tanks, to retrieve the bodies of the fallen enemy soldiers and wounded. These three companies of puppet troops were met with a fierce counterattack from the liberation forces, suffering heavy casualties and fleeing in disarray.

On March 26, the liberation forces in My Tho province thwarted a "sweeping" operation by six battalions of American and puppet troops in the border area between Mi Tho County and Ho Thanh County (in Binh Dinh province). They killed nearly two hundred enemy troops, destroyed and damaged seven M-113 armored personnel carriers, shot down three aircraft, and seized a large amount of weapons and military supplies.

On April 4, the liberation forces in Binh Dinh province engaged in anti-"sweeping" battles in Ha Long County and Chuong Duong County, achieving significant results by killing one hundred and eighteen American invaders and wounding seventy. After the enemy's "sweeping" operation was thwarted, the remaining enemy troops gathered in the Yu Dinh area of Ha Long County. The liberation forces then launched an artillery attack, annihilating dozens of enemy troops.

On April 1, the guerrilla forces and local troops in De Hoa County, Long An province, ambushed enemy troops conducting a "sweeping" operation in the county and enemy armored vehicle reinforcements, killing one hundred and fifty enemy troops and destroying twenty-two tanks and armored vehicles. On April 5, the guerrilla forces and local troops in De Nai County surrounded and attacked a puppet special forces unit that had been air-dropped into Dong My Thuan commune, killing fifty enemy troops and shooting down and damaging one helicopter each.
