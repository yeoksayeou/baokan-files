Our great leader Chairman Mao has solemnly declared his support for the struggle of American Blacks against violence to the whole world. The people of our autonomous region wholeheartedly endorse this declaration.

Chairman Mao's declaration points out the direction for the struggle of American Blacks and all revolutionary people of the world. It issues a great call to launch a sustained and fierce offensive against U.S. imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries. Chairman Mao's great declaration is the greatest support, encouragement, and solidarity for all oppressed nations and peoples of the world.

The current wave of the struggle of American Blacks against violence is a powerful demonstration of the unprecedented awakening of American Blacks and the broad laboring people of the United States. It shows the intensification of class contradictions within U.S. imperialism. This is a prominent manifestation of the current political and economic crises of U.S. imperialism. The broad masses of American Blacks have been further tempered in this struggle. The savage repression by the U.S. reactionary ruling clique has made more and more Black masses realize that only by using revolutionary violence to oppose counter-revolutionary violence, and by combining this in a sustained struggle with the workers' movement, can they ultimately overthrow the reactionary rule of the U.S. monopoly bourgeoisie and achieve the thorough liberation of Blacks.

Under the guidance of our great leader Chairman Mao, the revolutionary masses of China's ethnic minorities understand that, fundamentally, national struggles are class struggles. National struggles must be combined with the workers' and peasants' movements in one's own country and with the struggles of the oppressed and exploited peoples of all countries for liberation in order to achieve victory.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The struggle of American Blacks for liberation is a component part of the struggle of the people of the world against U.S. imperialism, and a component part of the world revolution of today." The revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries are mutually supportive. The struggle of American Blacks is a great support to the struggles of the peoples of all countries, and the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries strongly support the struggle of American Blacks.

The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is as excellent as that in the rest of the country, and it is getting better and better. We will raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. We will take this as our firm support for the struggle of American Blacks!

    美国黑人抗暴斗争必胜！
    内蒙古自治区革命委员会常委　赵真北（蒙古族）
    我们各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席，向全世界庄严地发表了《支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明》。我们自治区人民一千个拥护，一万个拥护。
    毛主席的声明，指明了美国黑人和全世界革命人民斗争的方向，发出了向美帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派发动持久的猛烈进攻的伟大号召。毛主席的伟大声明，是对全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民的最大支持、最大鼓舞、最大声援。
    这次波澜壮阔的美国黑人抗暴斗争的兴起，充分地表明了美国黑人和美国广大劳动人民的空前觉醒，表明了美帝国主义国内阶级矛盾的日益激化。这是当前美帝国主义政治危机和经济危机的突出表现。美国的广大黑人，在这场斗争中进一步得到了锻炼。美国反动统治集团的疯狂镇压，使越来越多的黑人群众认识到，只有用革命的暴力反对反革命的暴力，并在持久的斗争中同工人运动结合起来，最后推翻美国垄断资产阶级的反动统治，才能取得黑人的彻底解放。
    在我们伟大领袖毛主席的教导下，我国少数民族的革命群众懂得，民族斗争，归根结底是阶级斗争。民族斗争必须同本国工人运动和农民运动结合起来，必须同各国被压迫、被剥削人民争取解放的斗争结合起来，才能取得胜利。
    毛主席教导我们说：“美国黑人争取解放的斗争，是全世界人民反对美帝国主义的总斗争的一个组成部分，是当代世界革命的一个组成部分。”世界各国人民的革命斗争，是互相支持的。美国黑人斗争，对世界各国人民的斗争是巨大的支援，世界各国人民的革命斗争也有力地支援了美国黑人的斗争。
    我们内蒙古自治区无产阶级文化大革命形势和全国一样空前大好，而且越来越好。我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。我们将以此作为对美国黑人斗争的坚决的声援！
