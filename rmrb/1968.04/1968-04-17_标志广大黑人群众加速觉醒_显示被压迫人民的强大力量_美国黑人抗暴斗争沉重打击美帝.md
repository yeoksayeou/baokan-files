The recent wave of anti-violence struggles by the broad masses of American blacks has swept across more than a hundred cities in the United States in less than ten days, striking a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialists who are in trouble both at home and abroad. This has once again seriously shaken the reactionary rule of U.S. monopoly capital at home. This surging struggle of American blacks marks the accelerated awakening of more than 20 million American blacks; it reflects the intensification of class contradictions within the United States, and shows that the days of U.S. imperialism are getting worse.

This wave of black struggles erupted at a time when U.S. imperialism is already mired in various crises and difficulties that it cannot extricate itself from. U.S. imperialism has been beaten black and blue and is on the verge of defeat in its aggression against Vietnam; the movement within the country against the war in Vietnam is surging; the ruling clique is in disarray; at the same time, the dollar crisis has worsened, triggering the most serious financial crisis in forty years in the entire capitalist world. Therefore, this struggle by American blacks has dealt a particularly heavy blow to U.S. imperialism. The U.S. ruling clique is under attack from both inside and outside, surrounded on all sides, and is in a state of panic.

One notable feature of this wave of anti-violence struggles by American blacks is its swift onset and unprecedented scale. The storm that began on April 4 quickly spread to include the U.S. capital Washington and cities like New York, Chicago, and Detroit, totaling 125 cities. Large numbers of blacks, who have long suffered from brutal exploitation and oppression, took to the streets despite the savage suppression by heavily armed fascist police and military. They set fire after fire in revenge, smashing one white exploiter's shop and pawnshop after another. Many cities of pleasure for the exploiters have turned into battlefields covered in smoke and rubble. In their struggle against the fascist police, the black masses once again showed their courage and tenacity, fearless of sacrifice. Black snipers struck from all directions, striking fear into the hearts of the fascist police and military, making them see enemies everywhere. Even the U.S. imperialist stronghold of Washington did not escape the punishment of the blacks. Washington was engulfed in flames and thick smoke, with many shops of white racists near the White House smashed to pieces.

This wave of anti-violence struggles by blacks has shown the further bankruptcy of non-violence, marking the deepening of revolutionary violence in the minds of the black masses. More and more blacks are realizing that only revolutionary violence can be used to counter counter-revolutionary violence to achieve freedom and liberation. The fact that the non-violent advocate Martin Luther King was killed by white racists is a living lesson in itself. After this bloody incident, an angry black man said, "From now on, let us forget about non-violence!" These words represent the voices of millions of blacks who are fighting for freedom and liberation.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out with great wisdom: "National struggles, in the final analysis, are a matter of class struggle." U.S. imperialism practices extremely reactionary rule at home, brutally exploiting and oppressing the broad masses of American laborers, especially the more than 20 million American blacks.

For a long time, American blacks have been living at the bottom of American society under dual oppression of nationality and class. They have the lowest wages and the highest unemployment rates, with millions of blacks struggling on the brink of starvation month after month. The anger accumulated in the hearts of blacks is like a powder keg, ready to explode with just a spark. The interests of the broad masses of white laborers in the United States are the same as those of American blacks.

As the U.S. monopoly bourgeoisie increasingly tightens its exploitation and enslavement of the broad masses of American laborers, more and more white laborers are joining the ranks of the black struggle. In many places, whites have participated in the demonstrations, marches, and strikes organized by blacks. The combination of the struggle of American blacks and the American workers' movement will accelerate the collapse of the evil rule of the U.S. monopoly bourgeoisie.

The struggle of American blacks against racial oppression is a part of the global struggle against U.S. imperialism, providing strong support for the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries. U.S. imperialism conducts aggression abroad and oppresses and exploits its own people at home, making it a common enemy of the American people and the peoples of the world. In the struggle against this most vicious common enemy, American blacks, the Vietnamese people, and all oppressed peoples of the world are supporting and promoting each other: every heavy blow dealt by the heroic Vietnamese people to the U.S. aggressors is a great support to the world revolutionary peoples, including American blacks; and the brave struggle of American blacks also strongly supports the anti-U.S. struggles of the Vietnamese people and the peoples of all countries. They are comrades-in-arms fighting on the same front, and any victory on any battlefield will promote the overall victory of the anti-U.S. struggle.

The U.S. ruling clique has always used the two counter-revolutionary tactics of bloody suppression and political deception to deal with the black struggle. In the face of this irresistible wave of black struggle, the terrified U.S. ruling clique has sent tens of thousands of police and military, even deploying tanks, armored vehicles, and helicopters to suppress the black masses. Many blacks were killed, thousands were injured, and more than 20,000 were arrested. At the same time, the U.S. ruling clique hastily threw out a so-called "civil rights" bill, attempting to win hearts with the empty promise of "no discrimination against blacks in housing."

However, the U.S. ruling clique's attempt to extinguish the flames of struggle of the awakening American blacks with its two counter-revolutionary tactics is in vain. The broad masses of blacks are not intimidated by fascist suppression, nor are they deceived by any sweet talk. The vigorous development of the anti-violence struggles of American blacks in recent years has fully proven this; future history will also prove this.

The power of more than 20 million American blacks is invincible. With the support of the revolutionary peoples of the world, they will fight shoulder to shoulder with the laboring whites in the United States, thoroughly smash the shackles on their bodies, bury the U.S. imperialist system, and achieve their complete liberation.

Where there is oppression, there is resistance. The flames of the struggle of American blacks against violence are indomitable! This is the angry black masses of New York in fierce struggle with the police who are madly suppressing them.

    标志广大黑人群众加速觉醒　显示被压迫人民的强大力量
    美国黑人抗暴斗争沉重打击美帝
    黑人抗暴斗争风暴表明非暴力主义进一步破产，革命暴力斗争的思想深入人心
    新华社十六日讯　本社记者报道：美国广大黑人群众最近掀起了一场美国历史上规模空前的抗暴斗争，其势如暴风骤雨，在不到十天的时间里，横扫了美国一百几十个大小城市，给了内外交困的美帝国主义以沉重的打击，又一次严重地震动了美国垄断资本在国内的反动统治。这场汹涌澎湃的美国黑人斗争标志着两千多万美国黑人正在加速觉醒；反映了美国国内阶级矛盾空前激化，美帝国主义的日子越来越不好过了。
    这场黑人斗争风暴，是在美帝国主义已经陷于各种无法摆脱的危机和困难的情况下爆发的。美帝国主义在侵越战争中被打得焦头烂额、一败涂地；国内人民反对侵越战争运动风起云涌；统治集团内部争吵不休；同时，美元危机又恶性发作，并从而在整个资本主义世界触发了一场四十年来最严重的金融危机。因此，美国黑人的这次斗争对美帝国主义的打击格外沉重，美国统治集团受到内外夹攻，四面楚歌，惶惶不可终日。
    这场美国黑人抗暴斗争的一个显著特点是：来势迅猛、规模空前巨大。四月四日这场风暴掀起后，很快就扩展到包括美国首都华盛顿和纽约、芝加哥、底特律等一百二十五个城市。大批遭受残酷剥削和压迫的黑人，不顾荷枪实弹的法西斯军警的野蛮镇压，满怀对美国统治集团和种族主义者的强烈愤怒冲上了街头。他们燃起了一起又一起的复仇大火，捣毁了一家又一家白人剥削者的商店和当铺。许多剥削者寻欢作乐的大都市，都变成了浓烟笼罩、瓦砾满地的战场。在同法西斯警察的搏斗中，黑人群众再一次表现了英勇顽强，不怕牺牲的大无畏精神；黑人狙击手四处出击，打得法西斯军警胆战心惊，草木皆兵。美帝国主义的老巢华盛顿这次也未能逃脱黑人的惩罚，华盛顿火光冲天，浓烟滚滚，白宫附近许多白人种族主义者的商店被砸得稀烂。
    这场黑人抗暴斗争表明了非暴力主义的进一步破产，标志着革命的暴力斗争在黑人群众中进一步深入人心。越来越多的黑人群众认识到，只有用革命的暴力来对付反革命的暴力，才能求得自由和解放。黑人牧师马丁·路德·金这样一个非暴力主义者，却死于白人种族主义者的暴力，这个事实本身就是一个活生生的教训。这个血腥暴行发生后，一个黑人愤怒地说，“从此以后，让我们忘掉非暴力吧！”这番话代表了千千万万争自由、求解放的黑人群众的声音。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席曾经英明地指出：“民族斗争，说到底，是一个阶级斗争问题。”美帝国主义对内实行极端反动的统治，对美国广大劳动人民，特别是两千多万美国黑人，进行残酷的剥削和压迫。
    长期以来，美国黑人在民族和阶级的双重压迫下，生活在美国社会的最底层，他们工资最低，失业率最高，千千万万的黑人成年累月地挣扎在饥饿线上。黑人心中郁积着的怒火就象一座火药库，只要一点火星就可以引起爆炸。美国白人中的广大劳动人民的利益和美国黑人是一致的。
    随着美国垄断资产阶级日益加紧地剥削和奴役美国广大劳动人民，越来越多的白人劳动者参加到了黑人斗争的行列，在许多地方黑人举行的示威、游行和罢工斗争中，都有白人参加。美国黑人斗争同美国工人运动的结合，必将使美国垄断资产阶级的罪恶统治加速垮台。
    美国黑人反对种族压迫的斗争是全世界人民反对美帝国主义的总斗争的一个组成部分，对世界各国人民的革命斗争是一个强有力的支援。美帝国主义在国外进行侵略，在国内压迫和剥削本国人民，因此，它是美国人民和世界人民的共同敌人。在反对这个最凶恶的共同敌人的斗争中，美国黑人、越南人民和世界所有被压迫人民是互相支援、互相促进的：英雄的越南人民对美国侵略者的每一个沉重打击，都是对包括美国黑人在内的世界革命人民的巨大支持；而美国黑人的英勇斗争，也有力地支援了越南人民和世界各国人民的反美斗争。他们是站在一条战线上并肩作战的战友，任何一个战场的胜利，都会促进整个反美斗争的胜利。
    美国统治集团从来都是使用血腥镇压和政治欺骗的反革命两手来对付黑人斗争的。在这次势不可挡的黑人斗争风暴面前，惊恐万状的美国统治集团丧心病狂地出动了五、六万军警，甚至出动坦克、装甲车和直升飞机对黑人群众进行镇压，大批黑人被打死，数千人受伤，两万多人横遭逮捕。与此同时，美国统治集团又匆匆抛出一个所谓“民权”法案，妄图用“在住房方面不得歧视黑人”的空头支票来笼络人心。
    但是，美国统治集团妄图用反革命的两手来扑灭日益觉醒的美国黑人的斗争烈火，完全是徒劳的。广大的黑人群众是法西斯的镇压吓不倒的，也是任何花言巧语骗不了的。最近几年来，美国黑人抗暴斗争的蓬勃发展，就充分地证明了这一点；今后的历史也必将证明这一点。
    两千多万美国黑人的力量是不可战胜的。他们终将在全世界革命人民的支持下，同美国白人中的劳动人民并肩战斗，彻底粉碎套在他们身上的枷锁，埋葬美国帝国主义制度，获得自身的完全解放。（附图片）
    那里有压迫，那里就有反抗。美国黑人抗暴斗争的烈火是扑不灭的！这是纽约愤怒的黑人群众正在同疯狂镇压他们的警察展开激烈搏斗。
