The Revolutionary Committee of Tianjin Dyeing and Weaving Factory No. 3 has established a close relationship with the masses. The committee relies closely on the masses, and the masses take the initiative to care about the committee.

Their experiences are as follows: (1) The Revolutionary Committee conducts regular open rectification meetings, (2) Holds workers' symposiums to listen to the masses' opinions, (3) Visits workers' homes during holidays and rest days, (4) Committee members frequently work in the workshops.

	Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 30th: Tianjin Dyeing and Weaving Factory No. 3 has established a good practice: revolutionary masses take the initiative to care about the work of the factory's Revolutionary Committee, offering criticisms and suggestions at any time; the Revolutionary Committee listens humbly to the masses' opinions and actively accepts the masses' supervision and help. Therefore, since its establishment half a year ago, the Revolutionary Committee has truly represented the will of the broad revolutionary masses and has received the genuine support, support, and care of the masses.

	After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee of Tianjin Dyeing and Weaving Factory No. 3 in September last year, the 21 committee members were full of vigor and determination, working hard day and night with the aspiration to do a good job and make new contributions to the people. The masses also had high hopes for the newly born Revolutionary Committee. However, later, problems big and small, from revolution, ideological and political work, production to life, all piled up at the Revolutionary Committee to be solved, making the committee members overwhelmed, tied to the office, working hard and busily, often working for 10 to 12 hours a day, with poor results, and gradually reducing contact with the masses, leading to more complaints from the masses.

	The People's Liberation Army propaganda team stationed in the factory discovered this situation and, together with the committee members, studied the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao on the mass line, making them realize that to do a good job, relying solely on enthusiasm and good intentions is not enough. One must go to the masses, learn, work, and fight together with them, always maintaining a close relationship with the masses. Only in this way can the Revolutionary Committee take root among the masses, represent the will of the broad revolutionary masses, and stand unshakable. Revolutionary leading cadres in the committee also used their own experiences and lessons to help the young revolutionaries in the committee deepen their understanding of this issue. Liu Jinxi, a young worker serving as the deputy director of the Revolutionary Committee, said: No matter what kind of cadre, one must often go to the masses. If one is separated from the masses, one will achieve nothing. Believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and mobilizing the masses are the core of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We must never forget this.

	With the committee members' improved understanding, they adopted four methods to strengthen their contact with the masses.

	The first method is for the Revolutionary Committee to conduct open rectification. Not long ago, they spent half a day each day for half a month conducting open rectification, with representatives from each workshop and department participating. The committee members not only criticized themselves and revised their mistakes in the rectification meeting but also went to the classes to check their own shortcomings in front of the workers and sought the masses' opinions. During this rectification, the masses put forward more than a hundred opinions on further improving the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, cadres frequently participating in production labor, committee members going deep into the masses, and revolution guiding production. Chairman Mao taught us: "The rectification movement is a 'universal Marxist educational movement.' Rectification is for the whole Party to learn Marxism through criticism and self-criticism." Through open rectification, the committee members have received a "preventive injection" in their minds, have a clearer understanding of their own shortcomings, and have increased their confidence in doing a good job in the revolution and work.

	The second method is to hold workers' symposiums by class. In the symposiums, workers raised criticisms, hopes, and suggestions, which greatly educated the committee members. For example, old worker Liu Baoyi said: "We elected you because we trust you. If you don't come down, gradually become revisionist, you will not only let down the worker masses but also let down Chairman Mao!" Old worker Fu Xutai said: "In the future, you must maintain two-way contact and lean to one side. Two-way contact means contacting both factions of the masses, and leaning to one side means leaning to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line." Some workers also pointed out: "Maintaining the mass line is a lifelong big deal, but don't be hesitant, don't be a tail of the masses." Others said: "As long as you act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, take the PLA as an example, rely on the masses' strength, with these three conditions, even the greatest difficulties can be overcome." The committee members listened to these opinions, which was like attending a lively Mao Zedong Thought class, making them more deeply realize that Chairman Mao's saying "in a certain sense, the most intelligent, most capable, are the most experienced fighters" is a great truth, and thus more firmly believed in maintaining close contact with the masses, determined to better be the masses' students.

	The third method is for the committee members to visit workers' homes during holidays and rest days. Initially, the committee members visited more workers who agreed with their views. Old electrician Zhou Changhai saw the deputy director of the Revolutionary Committee, Liu Jinxi, and said to him: "You can't just visit workers who agree with your views. You should visit more workers who disagreed with your views in the past. The mistake of past cadres is that they only relied on a few people who they thought were good and got along with." These words greatly inspired Liu Jinxi. He immediately brought them to the discussion among all the committee members, and everyone went to visit workers who had more opinions about them. Revolutionary Committee Standing Committee member Yang Peilan visited the home of Gao Guilan, who had once posted a big-character poster against her and had not spoken for a long time. Gao Guilan was very moved and pulled Yang Peilan to sit next to her, saying: "I didn't expect you to come. I also had shortcomings in the past. In the future, please help me more!" In this way, through home visits, many knots were untied. Now, in the entire factory of more than 800 workers, the Revolutionary Committee members and workshop core group members have visited nearly 200 households, and some workers have been visited three times.

	The fourth method is to maintain close contact with the masses through participating in labor. An old worker told them: "You leave the office and come to the machine side. We work, study, and chat together. In this way, we think as one, talk as one, and work as one. Everything is easy to solve, and this is truly heart to heart!" Many committee members helped workers establish the "daily reading" system of studying Chairman Mao's works during their labor in the workshops. Revolutionary Committee Director Qu Fayi found that some class leaders in the first workshop were not united during his labor there, so he talked to them separately, did political and ideological work, encouraged them to do more self-criticism, and enhanced unity, which made the workers very satisfied.

	The Revolutionary Committee of Tianjin Dyeing and Weaving Factory No. 3 has raised the issue of contacting the masses to the height of the two-line struggle and treated it as a matter of loyalty to Chairman Mao. They regard listening to the masses' opinions at any time as a need for doing a good job in the revolution; they regard the masses' criticisms of the Revolutionary Committee as the masses' care and help for them. They insist on maintaining close contact with the masses, making the Revolutionary Committee and the masses establish a new type of fish-water relationship, and a political situation that is both serious and lively, both united and lively, is beginning to take shape in this factory.

    天津色织三厂革委会和群众建立起血肉相连的关系
    革委会紧密依靠群众　群众自觉关心革委会
    他们的经验是：（一）革委会定期开门整风，（二）召开工人座谈会听取群众意见，（三）利用假日和休息时间到工人家里访问，（四）革委会委员经常到车间劳动
    新华社天津三十日电　天津市色织三厂树立了一种良好的风气：革命群众自觉地关心工厂革命委员会的工作，随时提出批评和建议；革命委员会虚心倾听群众的意见，主动接受群众的监督和帮助。因此，革命委员会成立半年来，真正代表了广大革命群众的意志，得到了群众真心实意的拥护、支持和关心。
    天津市色织三厂的革命委员会在去年九月成立后，二十一名委员朝气蓬勃，怀着一心一意把工作做好，为人民立新功的愿望，起早贪黑，积极肯干；群众对于新生的革命委员会也寄予很大的希望。但是，后来工厂里从革命、思想政治工作、生产到生活的大大小小问题都堆到了革委会来解决，使革委会成员应接不暇，被拴在办公室里，辛辛苦苦，忙忙碌碌，每天甚至一连工作十几个小时，效果还不好，和群众的联系逐渐减少，群众的意见也多了起来。
    人民解放军驻厂毛泽东思想宣传队发现这一情况后，就同革委会委员一起学习伟大导师毛主席有关群众路线的教导，使他们认识到，要做好工作，光凭热情和良好的愿望是不够的，必须到群众中去，和群众同学习、同劳动、同战斗，始终和群众保持血肉般的联系，这样才能使革委会扎根在群众之中，才能代表广大革命群众的意志，才能永远立于不败之地。委员中的革命领导干部，还用自己的经验教训，帮助委员中的革命小将加深对这一问题的认识。担任革委会副主任的青年工人刘金喜说：不论什么干部，都要经常到群众中去，如果离开了群众，那就会一事无成。相信群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众，这是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的核心。我们永远不能忘记。
    革委会委员的思想认识提高了，就采取四种办法，密切同群众的联系。
    第一种办法是革命委员会进行开门整风。不久以前，他们在半个月内，每天用半天进行开门整风，各车间和部门的革命群众都派代表参加。革委会的委员们不仅在整风会上斗私批修，还分别到班组去，在工人面前检查自己的缺点，征求群众的意见。这次整风中，群众就进一步办好毛泽东思想学习班，干部经常参加生产劳动，革委会委员深入群众，以革命统帅生产等方面，提出了上百条意见。毛主席教导我们：“整风运动是一个‘普遍的马克思主义的教育运动’。整风就是全党通过批评和自我批评来学习马克思主义。”通过开门整风，革委会委员在思想上打了“预防针”，对自己的缺点认识得更清楚了，提高了搞好革命和工作的信心。
    第二种办法是按班组召开工人座谈会。在座谈会上，工人们提批评，提希望，提建议，使革委会的委员受到很大教育。例如，老工人刘宝义说：“我们选上你们，就是信任你们，如果你们不下来，慢慢变修了，不仅对不起工人群众，更对不起毛主席！”老工人傅绪泰说：“你们今后要两边联系，一边倒。两边联系就是对原来的两派群众都要联系，一边倒就是倒在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边。”有的工人还指出：“坚持群众路线是一辈子的大事，但也不要缩手缩脚，当群众的尾巴。”还有的工人说：“只要照毛主席的指示办事，以解放军为榜样，依靠群众的力量，有这三条，就是天大的困难也能克服。”革委会的委员听了这些意见，等于上了一堂生动的毛泽东思想课，更深刻地认识到毛主席说的“在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士”是伟大的真理，因而更加坚定了密切联系群众的信念，决心更好地当群众的小学生。
    第三种办法是委员们利用假日和休息时间入户访问工人。起初，革委会的委员比较多的是到与自己观点一致的工人家里访问，老电工周长海见到革委会副主任刘金喜，就对他说：“你可不能光到与自己观点一致的工人家里访问，应该多去曾经和自己观点不一致的工人家里。过去的干部犯错误，有一条原因就是只依靠自己印象好、谈得来的少数人。”这一席话，使刘金喜受到很大启发。他立即拿到全体委员中讨论，大家纷纷到对自己意见较多的工人家里访问。革委会常委杨佩兰来到曾经给自己贴过大字报而长久不说话的工人高桂兰家里访问，高桂兰很感动，一把拉过杨佩兰坐在自己身边，一边说：“想不到你也来了，过去我也有缺点，今后可多帮助我啊！”就这样，通过家庭访问，很多难解的疙瘩，一下子都解开了。现在，全厂八百多职工，革委会委员和车间核心小组成员已访问过将近二百户，对有的工人连续访问了三次。
    第四种办法是通过参加劳动，和群众保持密切联系。一位老工人对他们说：“你们离开办公室，来到机器旁，咱们一块儿劳动，一块儿学习，一块儿谈心，这样，就心往一处想，话往一处说，劲往一处使，什么事都好解决了，这才是心连心哪！”许多委员在车间劳动时，帮助工人们建立起“天天读”的学习毛主席著作的制度。革委会主任曲发义在一车间参加劳动时，发现有的班组领导核心不团结，就分别找他们谈心，做政治思想工作，启发他们多作自我批评，增进了团结，工人们非常满意。
    天津市色织三厂革命委员会，把联系群众的问题，提高到两条路线斗争的高度来认识，提高到是不是忠于毛主席的高度来对待。他们把随时随地听取群众的意见，看成是做好革命工作的需要；把群众给革委会提出批评，看成是群众对自己的爱护和帮助。他们坚持密切联系群众，使革委会和群众之间出现了鱼水相依的新型关系，一个既严肃紧张，又团结活泼的政治局面，在这个厂开始形成。
