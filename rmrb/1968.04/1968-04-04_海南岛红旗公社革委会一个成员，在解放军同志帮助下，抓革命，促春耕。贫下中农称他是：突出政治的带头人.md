The Red Flag Commune Revolutionary Committee in Hainan Island, Guangdong Province, Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, was established not long ago and immediately launched the battle to lead the spring plowing.

There is a leading cadre in the Revolutionary Committee. During the Cultural Revolution, after being criticized and helped by the masses, he was elected as a member of the Revolutionary Committee. When spring plowing began, he thought to himself, "The poor and lower-middle peasants have helped me stand up to lead the revolution and promote production. I should take on the responsibility and not let down the trust of the poor and lower-middle peasants." Therefore, during the spring plowing production, he was full of enthusiasm, staying in the countryside for a week at a time. From soaking seeds to sowing, from plowing with oxen to transplanting, he managed everything and did so in a very detailed and specific manner. However, he did not pay enough attention to organizing Mao Zedong Thought study classes.

The propaganda team of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the area discovered this situation and immediately had a heart-to-heart talk with him, saying: "Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline, the soul of all work. During the Cultural Revolution, many people criticized you for not emphasizing proletarian politics and not grasping the study of Chairman Mao's works. Now you are only concerned with production and not with organizing Mao Zedong Thought study classes, aren't you going back to the old wrong path? Don't forget the past lessons!"

The comrades from the PLA's words gave him great enlightenment. He thought: The poor and lower-middle peasants trust me and have given me the power; to hold this power well and use it well, I must emphasize proletarian politics. Not emphasizing proletarian politics is the biggest betrayal. He decided to remember the past serious lessons and start anew.

From then on, no matter where he went or what work he did, no matter how heavy or urgent the tasks were, he always remembered Chairman Mao's teaching that "political work is the lifeline of all economic work," and treated organizing study classes and emphasizing politics as the top priority. In the past, when he went to the countryside and met cadres or community members, the first question he asked was, "How is the production going?" Now the first question he asks is, "How is the study class going?" When he went to the countryside, he found that some production teams used gongs to call for work. He thought that gongs could only serve a "prompting" function and could not propagate Mao Zedong Thought, so he suggested using loudspeakers, which could be used at any time to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. During this period, he seriously helped the poor and lower-middle peasants organize study classes and achieved great results, promoting spring plowing production. The poor and lower-middle peasants called him: "A pioneer in emphasizing politics."

    海南岛红旗公社革委会一个成员，在解放军同志帮助下，抓革命，促春耕。贫下中农称他是：
    突出政治的带头人
    广东省海南黎族苗族自治州红旗公社革命委员会成立不久，便投入了领导春耕大忙的战斗。
    革委会有一个领导干部，在文化大革命中经过群众的批评帮助以后，被选为革命委员会委员。春耕开始，他心里想，贫下中农帮助我站出来抓革命促生产，我应该把担子担起来，不要辜负了贫下中农的信任。因此，春耕生产中，他干劲十足，一下乡就是一个星期。从浸种到播种，从使牛到插秧，样样他都管，而且管得很具体很细致。但是，他对大办毛泽东思想学习班却重视不够。
    驻在当地的解放军某部毛泽东思想宣传队的同志发现这个情况后，马上找他谈心说：“毛泽东思想是我们的命根子，是一切工作的灵魂。在文化大革命中很多群众批评你，不正是批评你不突出无产阶级政治，没有抓好毛主席著作学习吗？你现在只顾抓生产，不抓毛泽东思想学习班，不是又要回到错误的老路上去了吗？千万不要忘记过去的教训呀！”
    解放军同志的一席话，使他受到很大启发。他想：贫下中农信任我，把权交给我；要掌好权、用好权，就要突出无产阶级政治，不突出无产阶级政治，就是最大的忘本。他决心记住过去的严重教训，从头干起。
    从这以后，他不管到那里，干什么工作，任务再重再紧，都牢记毛主席关于“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导，把办学习班和突出政治当作头等大事来抓。过去下乡碰到干部或社员，第一句问的是“生产搞得怎么样？”现在首先问的是：“学习班办得怎么样？”下乡时，他发现有的生产队敲锣叫出工。他认为锣只能起“催促”的作用，起不了宣传毛泽东思想的作用，便建议用广播筒，可以随时用来宣传毛泽东思想。这期间，他认真帮助贫下中农大办学习班，取得了很大成绩，促进了春耕生产。贫下中农称他是：“突出政治的带头人。”
