The workers of the mining lamp group at the Ping'an Mine, No. 6 Shaft of the Fuxin Mining Bureau, heard during the coal-grabbing battle that some workers underground reported, "The mining lamps are not lighting up!" This made the workers' hearts race with anxiety. Mining lamps are the eyes of the miners underground. If the lamps do not light, it will directly affect production. This is a big deal.

These lamps had just been recharged, so why are they not lighting up? They immediately convened a "Zhuge Liang meeting" to find the cause of the lamps not lighting. At the meeting, someone suggested, "The mining lamps have a lifespan of three years, and ours have been used for five years. It's time to replace them with new ones." Most comrades thought that the lamps not lighting was not just a matter of long usage. If so, why are some lamps still bright? There must be a fault inside the lamps. Replacing each lamp costs several dozen yuan, and there are hundreds of lamps in the entire shaft. Replacing all of them would cost more than twenty thousand yuan. This is a huge expense! We, the working class, cannot be so wasteful and squander state property.

After hearing these two opinions, the group leader and Communist Party member Zhao Weiliang organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings on "frugal nation-building."

Chairman Mao's great teachings were like a beacon, illuminating everyone's hearts. Everyone said, "Without Mao Zedong Thought in our minds, our thoughts will not be clear, and we will not be able to eliminate the faults in the mining lamps." Everyone immediately got to work, disassembling five lamps of different brightness for a detailed examination and comparison. They quickly found the cause: rust on the lamp cover's spring increased the electrical resistance, affecting the lamp's brightness. Once the cause was found, everyone worked overtime to repair the lamps. In less than three days, nearly three hundred lamps that were not lighting up were all repaired.

"The mining lamps are lit!" The workers happily put on their bright mining lamps and, with renewed confidence, threw themselves into the new coal-grabbing battle.

    旧矿灯又亮了
    阜新军分区报道组
    “矿灯不亮了！”阜新矿务局平安矿六井矿灯小组的职工，在夺煤大战中，听到井下部分职工这样反映，心里十分焦急。矿灯是井下矿工的眼睛，灯不亮会直接影响生产，这可是件大事。
    这些灯刚充过电，为什么不亮了呢？他们立即召开了“诸葛亮会”，找矿灯不亮的原因。会上，有人提出，矿灯使用三年就到期了，咱们的灯用了五年，该换新灯了。多数同志认为，矿灯不亮，不单是使用年限长的问题，若不，为什么有些灯还很亮呢！一定是灯里面出了故障。换个新灯几十元，全井几百盏矿灯，都换新灯得花费二万多元，这是一笔多大的开支呀！咱们工人阶级可不能这样大手大脚，浪费国家财产。
    听了这两种意见，小组长、共产党员赵维良就组织大家学习了毛主席“勤俭建国”的教导。
    毛主席的伟大教导，象一盏光芒万丈的明灯，把大家的心照得透亮，人们都说：“脑子里没有毛泽东思想，思想不亮，就排除不了矿灯不亮的故障。”大家当即动手，拆卸了五个不同亮度的矿灯，进行细致的检查、比较，很快找出了矿灯不亮的原因：灯盖发条上长锈，增加了电阻，影响了灯亮。原因找出来了，大家加班突击修理，不到三天，近三百个不亮的矿灯，就全部修好了。
    “矿灯亮了！”职工们高兴地戴上了明亮的矿灯，信心百倍地投入了新的夺煤大战。
