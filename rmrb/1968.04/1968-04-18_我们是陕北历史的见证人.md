The reactionary film "Red River Waves" is a malicious attempt to rehabilitate the anti-party clique of Gao Gang. The creators and supporters of this poisonous film are audacious enough to steal the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, disguising a great schemer, a great conspirator, and a great traitor as the creator and executor of the correct line. The film shamelessly praises the alter ego of Gao Gang, Zhang Tiewa, on how he overcame failures and "escaped the jaws of death" to supposedly discover a "correct line"; how he solved a series of fundamental revolutionary problems such as establishing people's armed forces, persisting in guerrilla warfare, creating base areas, and surrounding cities with rural areas; how he mobilized the masses, led the local people to fight landlords and distribute land, developed and strengthened the armed forces of workers and peasants, and finally fought a decisive battle in Yongle Town, completely annihilating the enemy and consolidating and developing the revolutionary base area. This is all nonsense, a shameful distortion of revolutionary history, and a blatant attempt to glorify the anti-party leader Gao Gang.

Chairman Mao said, "Falsehoods are falsehoods, and disguises should be stripped away." Our company was originally one of the guerrilla units in the Shaan-Gan region. After our great leader Chairman Mao arrived in Northern Shaanxi, our company has been guarding him ever since. Based on our personal experiences, we can fully expose the lies of the filmmakers and unmask their evil plot to use films to oppose the party and Chairman Mao.

The true historical facts are as follows: Before Chairman Mao led the Central Red Army to Northern Shaanxi, the region was under the control of the "Left" opportunist line of Wang Ming. Gao Gang was an active promoter and loyal executor of Wang Ming's "Left" opportunist line, causing significant losses to the revolution. Gao Gang always followed the line of warlordism, practicing banditry. He organized some militia uprisings and blindly staged mutinies. Under Gao Gang's erroneous leadership, the guerrilla units paid no attention to establishing a solid revolutionary base area and rarely mobilized and armed the masses. They just wandered aimlessly, today here and tomorrow there, recruiting a bunch of people to attack the enemy without any plan, and when the enemy counterattacked, they were in a passive position of being beaten; the next day, they would recruit soldiers and horses, regardless of the disparity in enemy and friendly forces, and fight to the death, suffering continuous defeats, causing many revolutionary soldiers to die in vain, and seriously harming the revolutionary cause. Ironclad facts have fully proven that Gao Gang did not discover a "correct line" through failures but persisted in the "Left" adventurist line without learning from his mistakes.

In October 1935, our great leader Chairman Mao led the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army to successfully complete the world-shaking Long March of 25,000 li, arriving in Northern Shaanxi. Chairman Mao fundamentally saved the Chinese revolution and the Northern Shaanxi revolutionary base area. The great news of Chairman Mao's arrival in Northern Shaanxi greatly inspired and strengthened the military and civilian people of the Shaan-Gan border area and the entire country, dealing a heavy blow to the enemy. Chairman Mao turned the tide, corrected the erroneous opportunist line. In November of the same year, the great commander Chairman Mao personally deployed, and our beloved Vice Chairman Lin directly commanded the battle of Zhi Luo Town, annihilating the enemy's 109th Division, and in the pursuit, annihilating another entire regiment of the enemy's 106th Division. This battle thoroughly smashed the bandit gang of Chiang Kai-shek's third "encirclement and suppression" of the Shaan-Gan border area and "held a groundbreaking ceremony" for the task of placing the national revolutionary headquarters in the northwest for the Party Central Committee. To break the enemy's economic blockade and overcome severe economic difficulties, Chairman Mao issued the great call for self-reliance. The military and civilian people of the Shaan-Gan border area resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's great strategic call, launching a high tide of land reclamation and production, overcoming economic difficulties, improving military-civilian relations, and creating conditions for winning the national revolution. To achieve a thorough victory in the Anti-Japanese War and the War of Liberation, Chairman Mao personally led the great Rectification Movement in Yan'an, which had great historical significance. Through the Rectification Movement, the entire Party was united, and the poison of Wang Ming's "Left" opportunist line in politics, military affairs, ideology, and theory was thoroughly purged, ensuring the great victories of the Anti-Japanese War and the War of Liberation.

Ironclad facts have proven that it was Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee who arrived in Northern Shaanxi and saved the Shaan-Gan base area from the serious crisis caused by the "Left" opportunist line. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, the Shaan-Gan border area began its new history as the holy land of the Chinese revolution. Through revolutionary struggle practice, we deeply understand that it is because of Chairman Mao that we have our great Party; it is because of Chairman Mao that we have our great motherland; it is because of Chairman Mao that we have revolutionary victory. With boundless proletarian feelings for our great leader Chairman Mao, we are honored to carry out the task of protecting Chairman Mao. Under Chairman Mao's loving cultivation and the radiance of Mao Zedong Thought, our troops have grown from small to large and from weak to strong. Whether in harsh environments or in conditions of victory, we have excellently completed the glorious tasks entrusted to us by the people of the whole of China and the people of the whole world.

The creators and supporters of the poisonous film "Red River Waves" dare to attribute the great achievements that our great teacher Chairman Mao established for the revolution of the Chinese people and the people of the world to the anti-party leader Gao Gang, who has done nothing but evil, and parade them around, truly shameless! We are Chairman Mao's guard soldiers. We are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Whoever opposes Chairman Mao, we will resolutely overthrow them. We must, on the one hand, firmly grasp the rifle to fight against armed enemies and, on the other hand, firmly grasp the pen to fight against unarmed enemies. With blood and life, we vow to defend Chairman Mao, defend Vice Chairman Lin, defend the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, defend the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and defend Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We will carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Let the invincible Mao Zedong Thought forever shine upon all of China and forever shine upon the whole world!

    我们是陕北历史的见证人
    中国人民解放军某部　程安耀
    反动影片《红河激浪》是替高岗反党集团翻案的一股恶浪。毒草影片的炮制者和支持者狗胆包天，竟敢偷取战无不胜的毛泽东思想，把一个大野心家、大阴谋家、大叛徒乔装成为正确路线的创造者和执行者。影片恬不知耻地吹捧高岗的化身张铁娃如何经过失败和“虎口脱身”等严峻考验，自己摸索出了一条“正确路线”；如何解决了建立人民武装，坚持游击战，创立根据地，以农村包围城市等一系列革命的根本问题；如何发动群众，领导当地人民打土豪分田地，发展和壮大了工农武装，最后在永乐镇打了一场漂亮仗，干净彻底地消灭了敌人，巩固和发展了革命根据地。这完全是一派胡言，是对革命历史的无耻篡改，是明目张胆地往反党头子高岗脸上贴金。
      毛主席说：“假的就是假的，伪装应当剥去。”我们连队原来就是陕甘地区的游击队之一。当我们伟大领袖毛主席到达陕北以后，我连就警卫在毛主席身边，直到现在。根据我们的亲身经历，完全可以揭开影片炮制者的谎言，戳穿他们利用电影反党反毛主席的罪恶阴谋。
      历史的本来面貌是：在毛主席率领中央红军到达陕北以前，当时陕北正处在王明“左”倾机会主义路线的统治之下。高岗就是王明的“左”倾机会主义路线的积极推行者和忠实执行者，他给革命带来了重大的损失。高岗这个家伙一贯走军阀上层路线，实行流寇主义。组织一些民团暴动，盲目地搞兵变。当时在高岗的错误领导下，游击队根本没有注意建立牢固的革命根据地，也很少注意发动和武装人民群众。他们只是东奔西闯，今天在这里招降纳叛，纠集一伙人毫无把握地向敌人进攻，敌人一反扑，就处于被动挨打地位；明天又在那里招兵买马，不管敌我力量的悬殊，就同敌人死打硬拚，连连失败，使许多革命战士无辜牺牲，使革命事业受到严重的损害。铁的事实充分证明了：高岗根本不是什么在失败中摸索出了一条“正确路线”，而是在失败中始终没有吸取教训，顽固地坚持走“左”倾冒险主义路线。
    一九三五年十月，我们伟大领袖毛主席率领中国工农红军胜利地完成了震惊世界的二万五千里长征，到达了陕北。毛主席从根本上挽救了中国革命，挽救了陕北革命根据地。毛主席到达陕北的这一特大喜讯给了陕甘边区军民和全国军民极大的鼓舞和无穷的力量，给了敌人以沉重的打击。毛主席力挽狂澜，纠正了错误的机会主义路线。同年十一月，伟大统帅毛主席亲自部署、我们敬爱的林副主席直接指挥了直罗镇战斗，歼灭了敌一○九师，又在追击中再歼敌一○六师一个整团。这次战斗，彻底粉碎了蒋介石匪帮对陕甘边区的第三次“围剿”，并“给党中央把全国革命大本营放在西北的任务，举行了一个奠基礼”。为了粉碎敌人的经济封锁，克服严重的经济困难，毛主席发出了自力更生的伟大号召。陕甘边区军民坚决响应毛主席的这一伟大战略号召，掀起了开荒生产高潮，克服了经济困难，改善了军民关系，为夺取全国革命胜利创造了条件。为了夺取抗日战争和解放战争的彻底胜利，毛主席亲自领导了具有伟大历史意义的延安整风运动。通过整风，团结了全党，彻底地肃清了王明的“左”倾机会主义路线在政治上、军事上、思想上、理论上的流毒，保证了抗日战争和解放战争的伟大胜利。
    铁的事实证明了：是毛主席和党中央到达陕北后，把陕甘根据地从“左”倾机会主义路线造成的严重危机中挽救出来，陕甘边区在毛主席和党中央的英明领导下，开始了她作为中国革命圣地的崭新历史。在革命斗争实践中使我们深深地懂得：有了毛主席，才有我们伟大的党；有了毛主席，才有我们伟大的祖国；有了毛主席，才有革命胜利。我们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限深厚的无产阶级感情，担负着保卫毛主席的光荣任务。在毛主席的亲切培育下，在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，我们部队从小到大，从弱到强，不论在艰苦的环境中，还是在胜利的条件下，我们都出色地完成了全中国人民和全世界人民交给我们的光荣任务。
    毒草影片《红河激浪》的炮制者和支持者竟把伟大导师毛主席为中国人民和世界人民革命所建立的丰功伟绩，记在干尽坏事、恶贯满盈的反党头子高岗账上，并拿出来招摇过市，真不知人间还有羞耻事！我们是毛主席的警卫战士，我们无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于战无不胜的毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。谁反对毛主席，我们就坚决打倒谁。我们一定要一方面紧握枪杆子，同拿枪的敌人进行斗争，一方面紧握笔杆子，同不拿枪的敌人进行斗争。用鲜血和生命誓死保卫毛主席，保卫林副主席，保卫以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，保卫中央文革，捍卫毛泽东思想，捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。誓将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。让战无不胜的毛泽东思想永远普照全中国，永远普照全世界！
