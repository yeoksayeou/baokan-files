To maintain the revolutionary order of the capital, it is necessary to strengthen traffic management and ensure traffic safety. The revolutionary masses of the capital should actively mobilize, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize proletarian politics, and jointly maintain the traffic order of the capital.

1. All drivers and pedestrians must consciously maintain traffic order, strictly abide by traffic rules, and follow the instructions of the people's police.

2. It is strictly forbidden for anyone without a driver's license to drive, to drive someone else's vehicle without permission, to use vehicle license plates without authorization, or for vehicles without license plates to operate.

All vehicles must not exceed speed limits, must not rush through intersections, and must not park in non-designated areas. Public buses and trams must stop near the station sign when arriving at a stop, and must not cut in at the head of the line.

It is hoped that all levels of revolutionary committees and revolutionary mass organizations will conduct extensive propaganda and education among their members and actively assist in maintaining the revolutionary order of the capital. All people's police and public security personnel must firmly guard their posts, take their responsibilities seriously, and criticize and educate those who violate the above notice. For those who repeatedly violate the rules and intentionally disrupt traffic order, causing serious accidents, legal sanctions should be applied.
