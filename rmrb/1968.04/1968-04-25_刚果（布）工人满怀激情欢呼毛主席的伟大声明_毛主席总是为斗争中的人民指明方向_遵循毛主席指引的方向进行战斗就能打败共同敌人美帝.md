Chairman Mao always points the way for people in struggle
Following Chairman Mao's guidance in battle will defeat the common enemy, U.S. imperialism

NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY BRAZZAVILLE, April 23 — After Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence reached a factory in Congo (Brazzaville), workers in the factory spread the news and enthusiastically hailed the great statement. They passionately said that Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great leader of revolutionary people all over the world. We sincerely wish Chairman Mao a long life!

The workers spontaneously gathered together to study and discuss Chairman Mao's statement. In some workshops, workers selected several passages from Chairman Mao's statement, copied them onto Chairman Mao's quotation boards, and studied them repeatedly. In their discussions, the workers emphasized that to overthrow the new and old colonial systems and to fight against U.S. imperialism, one must rely on Mao Zedong Thought. American blacks, as long as they follow the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao and apply Mao Zedong Thought in their struggle, will surely achieve final victory.

A worker named Dominique said excitedly: Chairman Mao's statement is a great encouragement to American blacks who are fighting against the violence of U.S. imperialism, and it is also a great support to revolutionary people all over the world. He said, whenever a major event occurs in the world, Chairman Mao always points the way for people in struggle in various countries. This shows how much Chairman Mao cares for the oppressed and exploited people!

Another worker, Eiko, said, Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, the great helmsman of the world revolution. In 1963, after Chairman Mao issued a statement supporting the just struggle of American blacks against racial discrimination by U.S. imperialism, the struggle of American blacks surged. I believe that this time, the struggle of American blacks will surely achieve greater victories than ever before.

Worker Bisila emphasized that Mao Zedong Thought is a spiritual atomic bomb, and Chairman Mao's statement points the correct direction for the struggle of American blacks.

A militia member in the factory said: Martin Luther King advocated non-violence, but he was killed by the violence of U.S. imperialism. American blacks will learn from this and resolutely take the road of revolutionary violence.

A worker named Malonga said, all oppressed and exploited people are our class brothers, and U.S. imperialism is our common enemy. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and build the broadest international united front against U.S. imperialism.

Worker Diodona said, American black brothers are not alone in their struggle; we will always stand by their side. He then loudly read the following quotation from Chairman Mao: "All the people of the world, unite and defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! All the people of the world should have courage to fight, dare to win, and dare to sacrifice. In that way, the whole world will belong to the people. All the reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality they are not so powerful. From a long-term point of view, it is not the reactionaries but the people who are really powerful."

In the struggle against imperialism and colonialism, African workers who are advancing bravely enthusiastically hailed Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence.

Long live Chairman Mao!"

    刚果（布）工人满怀激情欢呼毛主席的伟大声明
    毛主席总是为斗争中的人民指明方向
    遵循毛主席指引的方向进行战斗就能打败共同敌人美帝
    新华社布拉柴维尔二十三日电  毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明传到刚果（布）的一家工厂后，这家工厂的工人奔走相告，热烈欢呼这一伟大声明的发表。他们满怀激情地说，毛主席不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，而且也是全世界革命人民的伟大领袖，我们衷心祝愿毛主席万寿无疆！
    工人们自动地聚集在一起，学习和讨论了毛主席的声明。在有些车间里，工人们还选择了毛主席声明中的几段，抄写在毛主席语录板上，反复学习。工人们在讨论中强调指出：要推翻新、老殖民主义制度，要同美帝国主义者作斗争，就必须依靠毛泽东思想。美国黑人只要遵循毛主席指出的方向，在斗争中运用毛泽东思想，他们就能够取得最后胜利。
    一位名叫多米尼克的工人激动地说：毛主席的声明是对同美帝国主义暴力进行斗争的美国黑人的巨大鼓舞，而且也是对全世界革命人民的巨大支持。他说，世界上每发生一桩重大事件的时候，毛主席总是为斗争中的各国人民指明方向。这表明了毛主席是多么关怀被压迫和被剥削的人民！
    另一位工人埃伊科说，毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，是世界革命的伟大舵手。一九六三年，毛主席发表支持美国黑人反对美帝国主义种族歧视的正义斗争的声明以后，美国黑人斗争的浪潮汹涌澎湃。我相信，这一次，美国黑人斗争必将会取得比以往任何时候都更加巨大的胜利。
    工人比西拉强调指出，毛泽东思想是精神原子弹，毛主席这一声明为美国黑人的斗争指出了正确的方向。
    工厂里的一位民卫团战士说：马丁·路德·金主张非暴力，但是他却死在美帝国主义的暴力之下。美国黑人将从这一件事中吸取教训，坚决走革命暴力的道路。
    一位名叫马龙加的工人说，一切被剥削和被压迫的人民都是我们的阶级兄弟，而美帝国主义则是我们的共同敌人。我们必须遵循毛主席教导，建立起一个反对美帝国主义的最广泛的国际统一战线。
    工人迪厄多纳说，美国黑人兄弟在斗争中不是孤立的，我们永远站在他们的一边。他接着高声朗读了下面这段毛主席语录：“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”（附图片）
