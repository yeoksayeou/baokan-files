Drawing a cake cannot satisfy hunger. In the Soviet Union, where capitalism is making a full comeback, the grain problem has always been a serious headache for the Soviet revisionist clique. Over the past decade, from Khrushchev to Brezhnev and Kosygin, they have made countless impassioned speeches and written numerous grand resolutions. However, drawing a cake cannot satisfy hunger, and boasting cannot replace bread. The grain problem not only remains unsolved but has become increasingly severe, exposing their predicament. Thus, this gang of traitors has resorted to lying, spreading smoke screens, and fabricating myths, attempting to divert attention and deceive the people.

At the end of last year, the head of the Grain Crops Administration of the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture, Khrushchov, gave a talk on the Soviet grain problem that was worth pondering. After the 1967 grain harvest was completely collected, he dared not reveal the grain production figures for that year but instead listed the grain figures for 1966, which had been repeatedly publicized, to dress up the facade. He boasted that it was the "highest yield in history" and the "highest procurement volume in history," blowing his own horn and acting very seriously.

Lies are still lies, and repeating them a thousand times cannot cover up the truth. Even if the Brezhnev clique has the skill of lying, as Lenin once sharply pointed out when criticizing opportunists who desperately avoided facts, "Facts are a stubborn thing," "Unfortunately! No matter how hard they try, they cannot overturn the facts."

Since Khrushchev came to power, the grain production figures announced by the Soviet revisionist clique have become "rubber numbers," changing with the political climate and at their whim, able to be inflated or deflated. They treat the 1966 grain production figures as a treasure, boasting about them endlessly. One moment they say it "increased by 1.8 times compared to 1940," and the next moment they say it "increased by one fold compared to 1913." They compare and compare, changing endlessly.

In fact, people have long been familiar with this magician-like number game of theirs. Just in 1965, when grain and food were in severe shortage in the Soviet Union, they on one hand lamented, "Agriculture has never reached the level it should have," "Agricultural backwardness cannot but affect the supply of grain to residents and the supply of raw materials to industry." On the other hand, they still boasted that the 1964 grain production "increased by 80% compared to 1940," "far exceeding the disastrous production of 1963."

If we compare this with the resolution of the "January Plenum" of 1955, this self-slapping farce becomes even more laughable. This resolution, in black and white, clearly states: The Soviet Union's "total grain production will increase to one hundred billion poods, which will be able to fully meet all grain needs, establish a more abundant grain reserve, and expand foreign trade." If we go by the grain production figures published by Khrushchov, then this indicator would have been exceeded by 4%. Therefore, logically speaking, the Soviet Union, which historically exported grain, should have "expanded" its grain trade, but in reality, what has expanded is not grain exports but grain imports. Logically speaking, the grain supply in the Soviet Union should have been "fully met," but why are there "no potatoes and macaroni in the workers' canteens"? Why have the prices of side dishes, which are closely related to grain, risen to "mythical heights," making customers feel as if they have had a bad dream and "stunned"? Why has the supposed "communism of potato stew and beef" that you have always boasted about now turned into "potato production has decreased" and "beef production has not met the needs of the state"? Who can this set of flawed, self-contradictory number games deceive?

This despicable gang of traitors has ruined the vast and resource-rich Soviet Union to this extent, making the grain problem so severe, completely as a result of thoroughly promoting capitalist restoration, destroying the collective economy, and implementing bourgeois dictatorship.

Under the rule of the Soviet revisionist clique, the wind of destroying the collective economy and vigorously "developing private economy" is blowing everywhere. In some regions, the average per household private plot has increased fourfold compared to the past. The labor force that does not participate in collective labor but engages in private sideline production and household chores has reached more than 25 million, accounting for 20% of the total labor force. In many grain-producing areas, "father-son teams" and "husband-wife teams" have emerged, and individual farming, private plots, and household sideline production are rampant, making the socialist collective economy rapidly disintegrate.

In today's Soviet Union, in more than 7,000 free markets, the volume of agricultural and sideline products on the market in 1965 was half to one fold more than in 1964. Many farms and collective farms have simply abandoned farming and engaged in commerce, opening canneries, running private businesses, and shouting, "Let the law of value work," "Rubles are everything"!

"High profits" have become the "credentials" of farms and collective farms, and the needs of the state have long been thrown to the clouds. The polarization in the countryside is severe, and many farm and collective farm leaders are actually new kulaks. They use their power to oppress and exploit the vast majority of farmers, and their "labor remuneration" is tens of times higher than that of ordinary workers and collective farm members. Under these circumstances, how can the Soviet revisionist agriculture not be in a mess?

The root cause of the Soviet grain problem is that the Soviet revisionist clique has reversed course in agriculture and implemented a full-scale capitalist restoration. Therefore, no matter how they try to find a way out in enterprise management or production technology, it is all in vain; and it will only make them sink deeper and deeper in the capitalist quagmire, unable to extricate themselves.

Khrushchev's reclamation—once praised to the skies. It was said that reclamation was the "most convenient and fastest way" to increase grain production, a "great source," and of "decisive significance." But before the words were out of his mouth, the Soviet revisionist clique had to change their tune.

Look, the Soviet press describes the "scenery" of the new reclamation areas as desolate: "Sandstorms everywhere," "the sun is not visible," "wells are filled up," "drivers have to turn on their headlights during the day," "roads are covered by sand dunes," "large areas of crops are destroyed," "sand even fills the irrigation canals and water sources," "drought is severe, and there is no harvest."

The reckless act of reckless reclamation has brought disastrous consequences to agriculture. In the new reclamation areas of Kazakhstan, the degree of land covered by sand is particularly severe, covering an area of more than 50 million hectares. Thus, this grandly publicized "increase production" farce of reclamation had to come to an end! But the Soviet revisionist clique shamelessly turned shame into glory, recently still boasting that reclamation is "a new source of grain increase," which is sheer nonsense, attempting to cover up their crime of squandering a large amount of the Soviet people's wealth, reaching the height of shamelessness. If you say Khrushchev's reclamation is what "source," it is indeed the truth, it is the "source" of increasing sandstorms, it is the "source" that makes tens of thousands of farmers who were deceived to the new reclamation areas destitute.

Large-scale corn planting—also once praised to the skies. It was said that this was Khrushchev's "great invention" after learning from American large farmers. This gang of incorrigible wastrels forced Soviet farmers to "plant this crop in areas where it was not planted before," boasting that doing so was the "greatest potential" to increase grain production, the "most important source," the "most important reserve," and would play a "leading role."

Look! Due to the stubbornness of the Soviet revisionist clique, what serious consequences did 1958 produce! Out of the 197 million hectares of corn planted, only 44 million hectares yielded dry grains, accounting for only 22%; while those that yielded no grains and could only collect some green fodder or simply collect some stalks amounted to 96 million hectares, almost half!

Whether it is reclamation or corn planting, these "magic tricks" are not effective at all. The situation of the great retreat of Soviet agriculture can no longer be concealed. Even Brezhnev had to admit that "our plans to increase agricultural production have not been completed," and agriculture is "actually stagnating."

After the Soviet revisionist clique seized power in the Soviet Union, the agricultural economy has been completely capitalist: individual farming has replaced collective farming, kulak economy has replaced socialist economy, and free trade has replaced planned trade. The Soviet grain problem is becoming more and more serious, which is the inevitable result of the Soviet revisionist clique's retrograde actions, thoroughly promoting capitalist restoration and implementing bourgeois dictatorship in the Soviet Union. Therefore, what kind of goods are Khrushchov's boasted "unprecedented bumper harvest" and "procurement plan completion"?

    画饼岂能充饥
    粮食部革命大联合委员会
    在资本主义全面复辟的苏联，粮食问题一直是苏修叛徒集团大伤脑筋的严重问题。十多年来，从赫鲁晓夫到勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流，不知作了多少慷慨激昂的报告，写了多少冠冕堂皇的决议。但是画饼不能充饥，吹牛代替不了面包。粮食问题不但解决不了，而且越趋严重，窘态毕露。于是，这伙叛徒就不得不乞灵于造谎言，放烟幕，编神话，企图转移视线，欺骗人民。
    去年年底，苏修农业部粮食作物总管理局的头头霍罗希洛夫，就苏联粮食问题发表了一篇耐人寻味的谈话。在一九六七年粮食已经全部收获以后，他不敢拿出当年的粮食产量，却列举早已再三宣传过的一九六六年粮食数字来装潢门面。说是“有史以来最高的收成”，“收购总量也是历年来最高的”，大吹大擂，煞有介事。
    谎言毕竟是谎言，谎言重复千百遍也掩盖不了事实真相。勃列日涅夫之流即使有一手说谎的绝技，但正如列宁批判机会主义者拚命逃避事实时所一针见血指出的：“事实是很顽强的东西”，“可惜！他们怎样大卖气力也推翻不了事实。”
    自从赫鲁晓夫上台以来，苏修叛徒集团所宣布的粮食产量就成了“橡皮数字”，随着政治行情的变化，随心所欲，可大可小。他们把一九六六年的粮食产量看成宝贝，吹得神乎其神。一会儿说它“比一九四○年增加了一点八倍”，一会儿又说它“比一九一三年增加了一倍”，比来比去，变化无穷。
    其实，他们这套魔术师式的数字游戏，人们早就领教过。就在一九六五年苏联国内粮食和食品奇缺的时候，他们一方面悲鸣：“农业从来不曾达到过应有的水平”，“农业落后不能不影响到对居民的粮食供应和对工业的原料供应”；另一方面还在胡吹一九六四年粮食产量“比一九四○年增加了百分之八十”，“大大超过了一九六三年灾难性的产量”。
    如果拿苏修叛徒集团一九五五年“一月全会”的决议对照一下，这幕自打耳光的丑剧，就更加可笑了。这个决议白纸黑字，写得清清楚楚：苏联“谷物总产量增加到一百亿普特之后，就能够完全满足对粮食的全部需要，建立更加充足的粮食储备和扩大对外贸易。”如果按霍罗希洛夫所公布的粮食产量，那就早已超过了这个指标的百分之四。这样，按理说，历史上出口粮食的苏联，粮食贸易应该“扩大”了，但事实上扩大了的不是粮食出口而是粮食进口。按理说，苏联国内粮食的供应应该“完全满足”了，但是为何“工人的食堂里没有马铃薯和通心粉”呢？为何和粮食密切有关的副食品价格提到“神话般的高度”，顾客们听了就“象做了一场恶梦”，“呆如木鸡”呢？为何你们一直标榜的所谓“土豆烧牛肉式的共产主义”，现在却落得“土豆的生产量下降了”，“牛肉产量远未满足国家的需要”呢？这一套破绽百出、自相矛盾的数字游戏，又能骗谁呢？
    这个不齿于人类的叛徒集团，把地大物博的苏联，糟蹋成这个样子，使粮食问题这样严重，完全是大搞资本主义复辟，破坏集体经济，实行资产阶级专政的恶果。
    在苏修集团统治下的苏联，到处刮起破坏集体经济、大力“发展私有经济”的黑风。有的地区平均每户的自留地比过去增加四倍。不参加集体劳动，专搞私人副业和家务的劳动力，竟达两千五百多万人，占全部劳动力的百分之二十。很多产粮区里，“父子组”、
  “夫妻组”纷纷出笼，单干、自留地、家庭副业搞得乌烟瘴气。社会主义的集体经济迅速瓦解。
    在今天的苏联，七千多个自由市场上，农副产品的上市量，一九六五年就比一九六四年增加一半到一倍。不少农场、农庄干脆弃农经商，开罐头厂，跑单帮，叫嚷“让价值规律来工作”，“卢布就是一切”！
  “高度营利”已经成为农场、农庄的“证书”，国家需要早已抛到九霄云外。农村两极分化严重，很多农场、农庄的头头实际上是新富农，他们利用职权压迫剥削广大农民，他们的“劳动报酬”比普通职工、庄员高出十倍到几十倍。在这种情况下，苏修的农业怎么不搞得一团糟呢？
    苏联的粮食问题无法解决，根本的原因是苏修叛徒集团在农业中大开倒车，实行资本主义的全面复辟。因此，无论他们怎样企图在企业管理或生产技术上找点“出路”，都是丝毫无济于事的；并且，只会在资本主义泥淖里越陷越深，不能自拔。
    赫鲁晓夫的开荒——曾经被吹得天花乱坠。把开荒说成是增产粮食“最便利和最迅速的办法”，“巨大的源泉”，“具有决定性的意义”。可是，言犹在耳，苏修集团就不得不改变腔调了。
    看，苏修报刊描写新垦区的“风光”是多么凄凉：“飞沙满天”，“太阳都看不见了”，“井都被填平了”，“司机白天行车要开车灯”，“村道都被沙丘掩上了”，“大面积庄稼被毁”，“风沙甚至填满了水渠和水源”，“干旱严重，没有收成”。
    胡乱开荒的赌徒行径，带来了对农业灾难性的后果。在哈萨克新垦区，耕地被风沙淹没的程度特别严重，面积已超过五百万公顷。于是，这场大事喧嚷的开荒“增产”的闹剧不得不收场了！可是，苏修叛徒集团却硬把耻辱当荣誉来夸耀，最近还在标榜开荒“是使谷物增产的新的源泉”，这真是睁眼说瞎话，妄图掩盖他们挥霍大量苏联人民财富的罪恶，无耻到极点。要说赫鲁晓夫的开荒是什么“源泉”，那也是实话，就是增产风沙的“源泉”，是使成千上万被骗到新垦区的农民倾家荡产的“源泉”。
    大种玉米——也曾被吹得天花乱坠。据说，这是赫鲁晓夫向美国大农场主学习之后的“重大发明”。这伙不可救药的败家子，硬逼着苏联农民“在过去不种的地区种植这种作物”，吹嘘这样干是“增产谷物产量最巨大的潜力”，“最重要的来源”，“最重要的后备”，“将起首要的作用”。
    请看！由于苏修叛徒集团的一意孤行，一九五八年产生了多么令人触目惊心的严重后果！玉米播种面积一千九百七十万公顷中，收到干籽粒的只有四百四十万公顷，仅占百分之二十二；而颗粒无收，只能捞点青贮饲料或干脆只能收点秸杆的，就有九百六十万公顷，几乎占一半！
    开荒也好，种玉米也好，这些“法宝”一点不灵。苏联农业大倒退的局面，再也掩饰不住了。连勃列日涅夫也不得不承认“我们提高农业生产的计划没有完成”，农业“实际上是在原地踏步”。
    苏修叛徒集团篡夺了苏联政权以后，苏联的农业经济已经完全资本主义化：单干代替了集体，富农经济代替了社会主义经济，自由买卖代替了计划贸易。苏联粮食问题越来越严重，这是苏修叛徒集团倒行逆施，在苏联大搞资本主义复辟，实行资产阶级专政的必然结果。因此，霍罗希洛夫所吹嘘的粮食“空前丰收”和“收购计划完成”，究竟是什么货色，还不一清二楚吗？
