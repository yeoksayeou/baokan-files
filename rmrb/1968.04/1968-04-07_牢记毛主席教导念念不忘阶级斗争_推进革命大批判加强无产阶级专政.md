The Dongfeng Commune, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, closely connected the local class struggle, severely criticized China's Khrushchev, struck down the class enemies, and raised the awareness of the commune members.

The People's Daily reports: The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, militiamen, and revolutionary cadres in Dongfeng Commune, Shenyang City, under the guidance of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the Shenyang Military Region Air Force, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, closely linked the local class struggle, especially targeting the situation where a handful of capitalist roaders within the party colluded with untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists to engage in rampant activities. They deeply carried out the revolutionary criticism, greatly enhanced the class struggle consciousness of revolutionary peasants and cadres, and strengthened the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The revolutionary criticism movement in Dongfeng Commune has been carried out vigorously. However, a handful of capitalist roaders within the party and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists colluded and conspired to sabotage the revolutionary criticism movement. When the poor and lower-middle peasants criticized China's Khrushchev's fallacy of "exploitation is meritorious," these capitalist roaders within the party actually instructed landlord elements to openly spread the rumor that "in the old society, landlords and poor and lower-middle peasants suffered the same hardships," vigorously defending China's Khrushchev's fallacy of "exploitation is meritorious."

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Dongfeng Commune, remembering Chairman Mao's teachings on never forgetting class struggle, decided to smash the class enemies' rampant sabotage activities and carry out the revolutionary criticism deeply and persistently, thoroughly purging the counter-revolutionary revisionist poison spread by China's Khrushchev. With the help of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the People's Liberation Army, they deeply excavated the political and ideological connections between China's Khrushchev and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. They used the method of class analysis to recall the situation over more than ten years since liberation. In the early days of liberation, China's Khrushchev vigorously advocated "exploitation is meritorious"; the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in this commune vigorously sabotaged the land reform movement, saying nonsense like "landlords fed the poor." During the socialist transformation period, China's Khrushchev advocated long-term protection of "rich peasant economy" and advocated "three selfs and one package"; the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in this commune engaged in opening wastelands, renting out houses, and exploiting hired labor. After the basic completion of the ownership transformation, China's Khrushchev vigorously advocated the theory of "extinction of class struggle"; the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in this commune echoed, saying nonsense like "landlords and rich peasants are the same as poor and lower-middle peasants, relying on work points to eat." China's Khrushchev strongly opposed emphasizing proletarian politics and strongly opposed Mao Zedong Thought; the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in this commune spread their poison, saying nonsense like "peasants studying Chairman Mao's works is useless, even if they study, they can't use it."

Through such recall and analysis, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres clearly realized: China's Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the party and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists have always sung the same tune and walked the same path. These handful of class enemies are like leeks hanging on the wall, with yellow leaves and withered roots but not dead hearts, always colluding and conspiring, dreaming of restoring their lost "paradise."

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, leaders of revolutionary mass organizations, militia cadres, and revolutionary cadres in Dongfeng Commune sharpened their eyes, raised their awareness, and strengthened their fighting spirit, immediately launching a new high tide of revolutionary criticism. To achieve the goal of hitting the target and not shooting in vain, they, under the guidance of the military propaganda team, studied "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" again and, in light of the criminal activities and reactionary thoughts of the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in this region during the Cultural Revolution, clarified the purpose of criticism. Before the criticism, they, using Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon, guided the commune members to understand how Chairman Mao taught and how China's Khrushchev spread poison, and how the class enemies in the production teams sabotaged.

Their specific approach was to carry out five exposures and five criticisms: exposing the sabotage by landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists of the mass movement of poor and lower-middle peasants studying Chairman Mao's works, criticizing China's Khrushchev's heinous crimes of madly opposing Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought; exposing the history of exploitation and wealth accumulation by landlords and rich peasants, criticizing China's Khrushchev's fallacy of "exploitation is meritorious"; exposing the counterattack and revenge sabotage activities by landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, criticizing China's Khrushchev's vigorous advocacy of the theory of "extinction of class struggle"; exposing the speculative and profiteering activities of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, criticizing China's Khrushchev's advocacy of "three selfs and one package" and long-term protection of "rich peasant economy"; exposing the instigation by landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists of conflicts between mass organizations, criticizing China's Khrushchev's capitalist reactionary line.

Such criticism meetings linked to the actual class struggle in the production teams had the greatest educational effect on the commune members and the most powerful strike against the class enemies. The masses reflected: such criticism meetings, we can see and touch; thinking of the bitterness of the old society, we hate China's Khrushchev even more. Through the revolutionary criticism, the broad masses of commune members planted deep in their souls the roots of eternal loyalty to Chairman Mao, eternal loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and eternal loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; in their minds, they established a strong class struggle consciousness. The revolutionary criticism movement deepened step by step, and China's Khrushchev here has become a pile of dog shit despised by humanity. The people's dictatorship's net of heaven and earth quickly formed, and the militia, poor and lower-middle peasant representatives, and revolutionary cadres automatically formed a three-in-one dictatorship supervision group. Every move of the class enemies is under the strict supervision of the broad masses.

    牢记毛主席教导念念不忘阶级斗争  推进革命大批判加强无产阶级专政
    东风公社在人民解放军帮助下，紧密结合当地阶级斗争的实际，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫，打击了阶级敌人，提高了社员觉悟
    本报讯　沈阳市郊东风公社的广大贫下中农、民兵和革命干部，在沈阳部队空军某部毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，紧密联系当地阶级斗争实际，特别是针对党内一小撮走资派勾结没有改造好的地富反坏右进行猖狂活动的情况，深入开展革命的大批判，大大提高了革命农民和革命干部的阶级斗争观念，强化了无产阶级专政。
    东风公社的革命大批判运动，一直进行得轰轰烈烈，但是，当地党内一小撮走资派和没有改造好的地富反坏右，串通一气，互相勾结，对革命大批判运动进行了猖狂的破坏活动。在贫下中农批判中国赫鲁晓夫“剥削有功”谬论的时候，党内一小撮走资派竟指使地主分子公开散布说“在旧社会，地主和贫下中农一样受苦受累”，竭力为中国赫鲁晓夫“剥削有功”谬论辩护。
    东风公社的广大贫下中农和革命干部，牢记毛主席关于千万不要忘记阶级斗争的教导，决心粉碎阶级敌人的猖狂破坏活动，把革命大批判深入持久地开展下去，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫散布的反革命修正主义流毒。他们在解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，深挖了中国赫鲁晓夫和没有改造好的地富反坏右在政治上思想上的联系。他们运用阶级分析的方法，回忆了解放后十多年来的情况。解放初期，中国赫鲁晓夫大肆宣扬“剥削有功”；这个公社的地富反坏分子，大肆破坏土改运动，胡说什么“地主养活了穷人”。在社会主义改造时期，中国赫鲁晓夫主张长期保护“富农经济”，鼓吹“三自一包”；这个公社的地富反坏右就大搞开荒、出租房子、雇工剥削。在所有制改造基本完成以后，中国赫鲁晓夫竭力宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭”论；这个公社的地富反坏右随声附和，说什么“地主富农和贫下中农一样，靠挣工分吃饭了”。中国赫鲁晓夫大反突出无产阶级政治，大反毛泽东思想；这个公社的地富反坏右大放其毒，胡说什么“农民学习毛主席著作没啥用，学了也用不上”。
    经过这样的回忆和分析，广大贫下中农和革命干部清楚地认识到：中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派和没有改造好的地富反坏右，自始至终唱的一个调，走的一条道。这一小撮阶级敌人象挂在墙上的大葱，叶黄根枯心不死，随时都在狼狈为奸，互相勾结，梦想恢复他们已经失去的“天堂”。
    东风公社的广大贫下中农、革命群众组织负责人、民兵骨干和革命干部，擦亮了眼睛，提高了觉悟，增强了斗志，立即掀起了革命大批判的新高潮。为了做到有的放矢，箭不虚发，他们在解放军宣传队辅导下，再次学习了《中国社会各阶级的分析》，并且对照本地区的地富反坏右在文化大革命运动中的罪恶活动和反动思想，明确批判目的。在批判前，他们针对揭发的问题，以毛主席最新指示为武器，引导社员懂得毛主席是怎样教导的，弄清中国赫鲁晓夫是怎样放毒的，生产队的阶级敌人是怎样破坏的。
    他们的具体做法是开展五揭发、五批判：揭发地富反坏右破坏贫下中农学习毛主席著作的群众运动，批判中国赫鲁晓夫疯狂反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想的罪行；揭发地主富农剥削发家罪恶史，批判中国赫鲁晓夫宣扬的“剥削有功”谬论；揭发地富反坏右的反攻倒算破坏活动，批判中国赫鲁晓夫竭力宣扬的“阶级斗争熄灭”论；揭发地富反坏右投机倒把、损公肥私的活动，批判中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“三自一包”和长期保护“富农经济”的黑货；揭发地富反坏右挑动群众组织之间的关系，批判中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线。
    这样联系生产队阶级斗争实际的批判会，对社员教育最大，对阶级敌人打击最有力。群众反映：这样的批判会，我们看得到，摸得着；想到旧社会的苦，更加憎恨中国赫鲁晓夫。广大社员群众通过革命大批判，在灵魂深处扎下了永远忠于毛主席、永远忠于毛泽东思想、永远忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的根子；在头脑中树立了强烈的阶级斗争观念。革命大批判运动步步深入，中国赫鲁晓夫在这里已成为不齿于人类的狗屎堆。群众专政的天罗地网迅速形成，民兵、贫协代表、革命干部自动组成三结合专政监督小组，阶级敌人的一举一动，都在广大群众的严密的监督之下。
