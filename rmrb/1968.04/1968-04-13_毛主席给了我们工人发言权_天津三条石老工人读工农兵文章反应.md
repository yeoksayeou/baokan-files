	Chairman Mao has given us workers the right to speak
	— Old Workers from Tianjin's San Tiao Shi Reflect on Reading Articles by Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers

	Old worker Wang Fuyuan from the Lamp Factory said: The special edition of the People's Daily titled "Seven Hundred Million People All Become Critics" published articles by workers, peasants, and soldiers. We old workers from San Tiao Shi are very happy. In the old society, we were called "stinking workers" and "rubber pullers" by the capitalists. We were beaten and bullied every day, and we had nowhere to vent our grievances. In that society where "money can make the devil push the millstone," we had no power or guns, so we had no "rights," and even if we had something to say, we had nowhere to say it! Today, Chairman Mao has given us the highest political status, and in the newspapers, he has given us a place to speak. This is something we could never have dreamed of in the past!

	Old worker Yin Shuzhang from the Flour Mill said: Seeing the People's Daily publish articles by workers, peasants, and soldiers, especially seeing our San Tiao Shi workers' affairs published, I listened to the broadcast and read the newspaper word by word, and I was so happy that I shed tears. I deeply understand that if it were not for Chairman Mao initiating the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Chinese Khrushchev would have brought back the capitalists sooner or later, and we would have suffered again. We would not even have the chance to publish critical articles!

	Old worker Li Yunchuan from the Flour Mill said: If it were not for Chairman Mao supporting us, exposing the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, how could the newspapers allow us to criticize the Chinese Khrushchev? In the past, the reactionary "authorities" and "experts" did not even glance at what we workers and peasants wrote. If we submitted a manuscript, they would not even lift an eyelid. It was as if we were throwing a stone into the water, and there was not even a ripple. Today, our articles and affairs by workers and peasants can be published in the newspapers. This is Chairman Mao's greatest concern and encouragement for the working class. In the future, we will use all our strength and unite with our class brothers to jointly fight against the enemy and thoroughly criticize and expose the likes of the Chinese Khrushchev.

	Liu Shiyao and Zhang Yufa from the Machine Tool Accessories Factory said: In the past, we had grievances but nowhere to vent them. Many propaganda institutions were controlled by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, and there was no place for us workers and peasants to stand. The Chinese Khrushchev spread so much poison that our eyes were about to burst with anger, but we had nowhere to vent our anger. Now, Chairman Mao has given us the right to speak, and we have our own propaganda front. We will definitely, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly occupy this front and thoroughly criticize and expose the Chinese Khrushchev until we achieve complete victory and do not retreat from the battlefield!

### 毛主席给了我们工人发言权——天津三条石老工人读工农兵文章反应

    毛主席给了我们工人发言权
    ——天津三条石老工人读工农兵文章反应
    制灯厂老工人王福元说：《人民日报》《七亿人民都来做批判家》专版上，发表工农兵的文章，我们三条石老工人非常高兴。在旧社会，我们这些被资本家骂做“臭工人”“拉胶皮”的，整天挨打受欺，净和“死”拚命。有仇有冤没处申述，旧社会没有咱工人的发言权。我们有一肚子话，有一肚子深仇大恨，可是在那“有钱能使鬼推磨”的吃人的社会里，咱没有印把子和枪杆子，就是没有“权”，有话也没处说啊！今天毛主席给了咱最高的政治地位，在报上也给咱说话的地方，这是过去做梦也想不到的！
    面粉机厂老工人银树章说：见《人民日报》登了工农兵的文章，特别是登了我们三条石工人的事后，我一边听广播，一边一个字一个字地看着报，高兴得流下了眼泪。我深深知道，要不是毛主席发动了无产阶级文化大革命，中国赫鲁晓夫早晚会把资本家请回来，我们又得吃二遍苦，更不用说给我们登批判文章了！
    面粉机厂老工人李云川说：要不是毛主席给咱撑腰，揪出了党内一小撮走资派，报纸上还能让咱们去批判中国赫鲁晓夫？过去反动“权威”和“专家”们对咱工农兵写的东西连看也不看一眼，咱要送个稿，他们眼皮也不撩一撩，真不如往水里投块石头，还有点响声。今天咱工农兵的文章和事情也能上报，就是毛主席对咱工人阶级的最大关怀和鼓舞。以后，咱要有多大劲用多大劲，和自己的阶级兄弟团结起来，共同对敌，把中国赫鲁晓夫之流彻底批倒批臭。
    机床附件厂刘世耀、张玉发说：过去我们有苦没处申诉。许多宣传机构被党内一小撮走资派把持着，没有我们工农兵的立脚点。中国赫鲁晓夫放了那么多毒，把我们眼珠子都气炸了，可我们满满一肚子怒火没地方撒。现在毛主席给了我们发言权，我们有了自己的宣传阵地，我们一定永远在毛泽东思想指导下牢牢占领这块阵地，把中国赫鲁晓夫彻底批倒批臭，不获全胜决不下火线！
