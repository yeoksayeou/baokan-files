Even with a Strong Foundation, We Must Insist on Frugality for Spring Plowing

The Xiyang Commune Red Guard Brigade's Xiaodian Production Team in Liaoning Province's Zhuanghe County had a bumper harvest in agriculture last year. The production team's foundation is now strong, and it is also a model brigade for the commune to learn from Dazhai. During this year's spring plowing, some people and cadres in the team developed the idea of spending lavishly and seeking novelty. Some said, "When food is in the mouth, it must be eaten; when money is in hand, it must be spent. The production team's foundation is strong, so we should buy a rubber-tired cart and add a big horse." Others said, "Our production team is a model brigade for the commune to learn from Dazhai. All kinds of carts, horses, and farm tools should be cleaned up and dressed up, so that people won't say we are rustic."

The leadership of the production team and the stationed military Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team analyzed this issue and believed that whether this idea could be overcome in time was related to whether Mao Zedong's great policy of "frugality for revolution" and "thrift in running the commune" could be correctly implemented, and whether the spirit of Dazhai could be truly learned and the socialist road could be firmly followed. Therefore, they followed Mao Zedong's teachings and held a study class focusing on frugality for revolution.

Through the study, the awareness of the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres was greatly raised. They deeply understood the great significance of Mao Zedong's call to "further frugality for revolution." They unanimously agreed that showing off, flaunting wealth, and extravagant waste are not in line with Mao Zedong Thought and are not the true character of the poor and lower-middle peasants. The production team leader, Liu Hongqin, said: "Originally, I thought that our Xiaodian Production Team had a bumper harvest last year and is a model brigade for the commune to learn from Dazhai. If someone comes to visit in the future, they will see our old ox pulling an iron cart, looking rustic, which is not glorious. I always felt that we should be extravagant this year and replace all the old ox carts with big horse carts. After comparing this with Chairman Mao's teachings, I realized it was wrong. This idea of spending lavishly and seeking novelty is not in line with Chairman Mao's great teachings. It is the 'private' character at work, and it is the poison of China's Khrushchev."

An old poor peasant sharply criticized the team cadres, saying: "Now it is not that our carts, horses, and farm tools are not useful, but it is our thoughts that are not useful. We have forgotten our roots."

Based on the improved awareness, the poor and lower-middle peasants and team cadres jointly established a system of public supervision over finances. Everyone conducted a comprehensive inspection of the various vehicles and farm tools needed for spring plowing, ensuring that what needs to be repaired is repaired and what needs to be supplemented is supplemented. They insisted on using old items instead of buying new ones, using inferior items instead of adding better ones, and firmly not spending money that can be saved and not buying materials that can be done without. They insisted on frugality for spring plowing.

### 家底厚也要坚持节约闹春耕

    家底厚也要坚持节约闹春耕
    辽宁省庄河县向阳公社红卫大队小甸生产队去年获得了农业大丰收，生产队家底厚了，又是公社学习大寨的样板队，在今年春耕生产中，有的群众和干部便产生了大手大脚、贪好求新的思想。有的说，饭到口得吃，钱到手得花，生产队家底厚了，应该拴台胶车、添头大马；有的说，咱们生产队是公社学习大寨的样板队，各种车马农具应该收拾收拾，打扮打扮，别叫人家说咱土里土气。
    生产队的领导班子和驻军毛泽东思想宣传队对这个问题进行了分析，认为这种思想能不能及时得到克服，是关系到能不能正确贯彻执行毛主席“要节约闹革命”、“勤俭办社”的伟大方针，关系到能否真正把大寨精神学到手，坚持社会主义道路的大问题。于是，就遵照毛主席的教导，举办了一期以节约闹革命为主要内容的毛泽东思想学习班。
    通过学习，大大提高了贫下中农和革命干部的思想觉悟，他们深刻地认识到毛主席号召“要进一步节约闹革命”的重大意义。一致认为，讲排场，摆阔气，铺张浪费是不符合毛泽东思想的，不是贫下中农应有的本色。生产队长刘洪忱说：“原来我认为咱们小甸生产队去年丰收了，又是公社学习大寨样板队，以后要是有人来参观，看看咱们老牛拉铁车，土里土气的，多不光采。总觉得今年应该阔气一下，想把原来那些老牛车全换成大马车。这回跟毛主席的教导一对照，觉得不对劲了。这种大手大脚讲阔气的思想是不符合毛主席伟大教导的，这是头脑中私字作怪，是中了中国赫鲁晓夫的毒。”有的老贫农对队干部提出尖锐的批评说：现在不是咱们的车马农具不管用，倒是咱们的思想不管用了，忘本了。
    在提高认识的基础上，贫下中农和队干部共同建立了群众监督财务的制度。大家对春耕生产所需的各种车辆农具进行了全面检查，做到该修的修，该补的补，有旧的不买新的，有次的不添好的，可花可不花的钱坚决不花，可买可不买的物资坚决不买，坚持节约闹春耕。（附图片）
