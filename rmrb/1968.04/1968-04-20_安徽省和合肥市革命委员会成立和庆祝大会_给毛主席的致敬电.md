	Dearest and most respected Great Leader Chairman Mao:

	The 35 million Jianghuai people, who are infinitely loyal to you, are filled with the spirit of battle and report to you, our heart's reddest red sun, a piece of news that is exhilarating to the heart: the Anhui Province and Hefei City Revolutionary Committees have been gloriously born in the great waves of class struggle. This is a great victory for your brilliant thoughts! This is a great victory for your proletarian revolutionary line!

	On this day of great joy and celebration, our hearts surge with emotion, and we have a thousand words and ten thousand songs to tell you! A thousand words and ten thousand songs all merge into one voice: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live for ten thousand years!

	In the old China, riddled with disasters, the people of Anhui, under your guidance of "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," together with the people of the entire nation, waged a relentless struggle against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. With the heroic spirit of "daring to change the heavens and the earth," we overthrew the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and wrote a brilliant page in the history of the liberation of the Chinese people.

	After the liberation of the entire nation, you led us forward on the broad road of socialist revolution and socialist construction. Under your great call to "definitely improve the Huai River," millions of people began the struggle to change the heavens and the earth. In the high tide of socialist transformation in the countryside, you highly praised the revolutionary ideals and pioneering spirit of the Anhui people: "The people have limitless creativity." In the fiery days of the Great Leap Forward, you came among us. In the countryside, in the cities, on the roads teeming with people, you met us warmly, you talked to us warmly. How many people's eyes were filled with tears, how many people's hearts were stirred! This boundless happiness forever inspires us to be full of vigor and high spirits!

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! In the unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution initiated and led by you, we resolutely responded to your great battle call of "Bombard the Headquarters" and raised high the banner of "It is reasonable to rebel against reactionaries." We launched a general offensive against China's Khrushchev and his agents in Anhui, Li Bo Hua and Huang Yan! The battle song of the proletarian revolution shook the Jianghuai land! In the face of the frenzied attacks of the class enemies, we stood firm and unyielding, our wills as strong as steel, and we fought to the end to defend your revolutionary line!

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You are in our hearts, you are our confidant. You care deeply about the proletarian cultural revolution in Anhui Province. At the critical moment of the struggle between the two lines, you issued the wise directive to the Anhui garrison: "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses," giving us the strongest support and the greatest encouragement. At the crucial moment of the struggle to seize power from the handful of capitalist roaders within the party, it was you and your close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin, who personally issued the nine-point decision and five-point directive regarding the Anhui issue, providing the most scientific, most profound, and most complete summary of the Anhui proletarian cultural revolution, and setting a series of correct policies, pointing out the direction of our struggle.

	The tree wants to be still, but the wind will not cease. The handful of traitors, spies, capitalist roaders, and all the ghosts and snakes hidden in Anhui, unwilling to accept their failure, are still making desperate struggles. The class struggle has taken on a new, sharp, and complex situation. Again, it is the time when the proletarian revolutionaries need the most support. You and Vice Chairman Lin sent us our comrades-in-arms—the great People's Liberation Army of China. Missing our comrades, longing for our comrades, meeting on the battlefield is especially dear. The heroic People's Liberation Army, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly supports the proletarian revolutionaries and fights shoulder to shoulder with us, achieving great deeds for the Anhui proletarian cultural revolution!

	The east wind brings good news from afar. In the golden September, the proletarian headquarters led by you and Vice Chairman Lin issued the great directive of "September 5" and the notice of "September 23," which have great historical significance. We acted upon hearing the news, opposed bourgeois factionalism, rooted out the black hands that split the revolutionary masses, and achieved great unity. Shoulder to shoulder, heart to heart, we march forward in a mighty stream on the path you once walked, welcoming the spring of the Anhui proletarian cultural revolution.

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Your brilliant thoughts have reddened the sky, earth, and mountains of Anhui! The great Dabie Mountains cannot compare to the height of your kindness; the vast waters of the Yangtze River cannot compare to the length of your kindness!

	"The ship navigates the sea with a helmsman; revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Your brilliant thoughts are the contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the lifeline of the Chinese people. After the establishment of the revolutionary committees, among the myriad of principles, the most fundamental and important one is to vigorously conduct Mao Zedong Thought study classes. We must take your series of latest directives as the guideline, "criticize and repudiate revisionism and fight against selfishness," and study and apply your brilliant thoughts actively. We are infinitely loyal to you, infinitely loyal to your brilliant thoughts, and infinitely loyal to your proletarian revolutionary line. In other words, we are infinitely loyal to the Party and to the people.

	Dearest Chairman Mao, we must firmly remember your great teachings: "Never forget class struggle." We must launch more fierce attacks on the enemies of the proletarian revolution, carry out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, and vow to criticize and expose China's Khrushchev and his agents in Anhui, Li Bo Hua and Huang Yan, to the core! We must resolutely oppose right opportunism, right factionalism, and right capitulationism, and oppose all kinds of bourgeois reactionary trends. We must strengthen our awareness of the enemy, heighten our vigilance a hundredfold, and root out all traitors, spies, counter-revolutionaries, and all ghosts and snakes, sweeping them into the garbage heap of history.

	Dearest Chairman Mao, we must firmly remember your great teachings, consolidate and develop the great unity of the revolution, the three-in-one combination, and do well in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of our units; we must hold high the banner of "supporting the army and loving the people," strengthen military-civilian unity, and form an iron wall; we must grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, promote preparedness, and do well in coal, steel, and grain production, and improve water and land transportation. We must fully implement your latest directives, and from the ideological, political, economic, and organizational aspects, achieve a comprehensive victory in the proletarian cultural revolution!

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! On this great festival of the proletarian revolutionaries, we hold the red book in our hands, look up at the golden Beijing, and our million hearts beat fiercely, and our million smiling faces face the red sun. We wish you, our great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life!

    安徽省和合肥市革命委员会成立和庆祝大会
    给毛主席的致敬电最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席：
    无限忠于您的三千五百万江淮儿女，满怀战斗的豪情，向您，我们心中最红最红的红太阳，报告一个振奋人心的喜讯：安徽省和合肥市革命委员会，在阶级斗争的大风浪中光荣地诞生了。这是您光辉思想的伟大胜利！这是您无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利！
      在这大喜大庆的日子里，我们心潮澎湃，我们有千言万语要对您讲，我们有千歌万曲要给您唱！千言万语、万曲千歌，汇成了一个声音：毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    在灾难深重的旧中国，安徽人民在您“枪杆子里面出政权”的光辉思想的指引下，和全国人民一道，同帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义进行了艰苦卓绝的斗争，以“敢教日月换新天”的英雄气概，推翻了国民党的反动统治，在中国人民的解放史上写下了光辉的一页。
    在全国解放以后，您领导着我们在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的康庄大道上胜利前进。在您“一定要把淮河修好”的伟大号召下，千百万人民群众开始了改天换地的斗争。在农村社会主义高潮中，您高度赞扬了安徽人民的革命理想和首创精神：“人民群众有无限的创造力。”在大跃进的火热年代里，您又来到了我们中间。在农村，在城市，在人群似海的路上，您和我们亲切会见，您和我们亲切交谈，多少人热泪盈眶，多少人心情激荡！这无限的幸福，永远鼓舞着我们意气风发，斗志昂扬！
      毛主席啊，毛主席！在您亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们坚决响应您《炮打司令部》的伟大战斗号召，高举“对反动派造反有理”的大旗，向中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在安徽的代理人李葆华、黄岩之流发动了总攻击！无产阶级革命造反的战歌，震撼着江淮大地！在阶级敌人疯狂的围攻面前，我们坚强不屈，意志如钢，坚决为捍卫您的革命路线而战斗到底！
      毛主席啊，毛主席！您和我们心连心，您是我们的贴心人。您对安徽省的无产阶级文化大革命非常关怀。在两条路线斗争的关键时刻，您对安徽驻军发出了“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的英明指示，给了我们以最有力的支持，最巨大的鼓舞。在向党内一小撮走资派进行夺权斗争的紧要关头，是您和您的亲密战友林副主席亲自批发了关于安徽问题的九条决定和五条批示，对安徽无产阶级文化大革命作了最科学、最精辟、最完整的总结，规定了一系列正确政策，为我们指明了战斗的航向。
    树欲静而风不止。隐藏在安徽的一小撮叛徒、特务、走资派和一切牛鬼蛇神，不甘心于自己的失败，还在疯狂地进行垂死挣扎。阶级斗争出现了尖锐复杂的新形势。又是无产阶级革命派最需要支援的时候，您和林副主席派来了我们的亲人——伟大的中国人民解放军。想亲人，盼亲人，战地相逢格外亲。英雄的人民解放军高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决支持无产阶级革命派，和我们并肩战斗，为安徽无产阶级文化大革命建立了丰功伟绩！
      东风万里传喜讯。在金色的九月，以您为首，以林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，向我们发出了具有伟大历史意义的“九·五”指示和“九·二三”通知，我们闻风而动，反对资产阶级派性，揪出分裂革命群众的黑手，实现了革命的大联合。我们肩并肩，心连心，浩浩荡荡地行进在您当年走过的路上，迎来了安徽省无产阶级文化大革命的春天。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您那光辉的思想，照红了安徽的天地山河！巍巍大别山，比不过您的恩情高；滔滔长江水，比不过您的恩情长！
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”您的光辉思想，是当代的马克思列宁主义，是我国人民的命根子。革命委员会成立以后，千条万条，最根本、最重要的一条，是大力办好毛泽东思想学习班。我们一定要以您的一系列最新指示为纲，“斗私，批修”，活学活用、学好用好您的光辉思想。无限忠于您，无限忠于您的光辉思想，无限忠于您的无产阶级革命路线。就是说，无限忠于党，忠于人民。
    最敬爱的毛主席，我们一定要牢牢记着您的伟大教导：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”。不断地向无产阶级革命的敌人发动更加猛烈的进攻，深入持久地开展革命的大批判，誓把中国赫鲁晓夫及其在安徽的代理人李葆华、黄岩之流批深批透，斗倒斗臭！坚决反对右倾保守主义，右倾分裂主义，右倾投降主义，反对形形色色的资产阶级反动思潮。我们一定要加强敌情观念，百倍提高警惕，把一小撮叛徒、特务、反革命分子和一切牛鬼蛇神统统挖出来，扫进历史的垃圾堆。
      最敬爱的毛主席，我们一定要牢牢记着您的伟大教导，巩固和发展革命的大联合、革命的三结合，搞好本单位的斗、批、改；我们一定要更高地举起“拥军爱民”的大旗，加强军民团结，结成钢铁长城；我们一定要狠抓革命、猛促生产、猛促工作、猛促战备，抓好煤炭、钢铁、粮食生产，搞好水陆交通运输，全面落实您的最新指示，从思想上、政治上、经济上、组织上，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
      毛主席啊，毛主席！在这无产阶级革命派的盛大节日里，我们手捧红彤彤的宝书，仰望金灿灿的北京城，千万颗红心在激烈地跳动，千万张笑脸迎着红太阳，最衷心祝愿您啊，我们的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
                      安徽省和合肥市革命委员会成立和庆祝大会
                        一九六八年四月十八日
