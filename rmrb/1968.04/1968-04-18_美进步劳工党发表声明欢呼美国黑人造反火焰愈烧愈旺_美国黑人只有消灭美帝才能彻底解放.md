New York, April 17 (New China News Agency) – The National Committee of the Progressive Labor Party of the U.S. recently issued a statement on the black anti-violence struggle in the U.S. The statement pointed out: “Blacks are abandoning Martin Luther King’s non-violence. Blacks know that the most brutal oppressor in the world is American imperialism, and they understand that the only way to achieve liberation from American imperialism’s rule is to destroy American imperialism.”

The statement emphasized: “Across the country, they (referring to black masses) have taken action, not as ‘peaceful protesters,’ but as angry warriors. With such angry actions, they spit on the lie that the U.S. is a so-called democratic country.”

The statement pointed out: “Revolution is not just happening in Vietnam! The flames of rebellion are burning here as well! The large-scale, heroic actions of blacks prove that the struggle for black liberation is not a fleeting phenomenon, but is rising higher and higher! The actions for black liberation are proving that Martin Luther King’s erroneous advocacy of non-violence has been buried along with him.”

The statement said: “Washington, the place that plots the use of violence against the whole world, has been made immobile by tens of thousands of brave black fighters. Thus, Johnson ordered tanks and machine guns to be sent to save the white officials. He and his accomplices are terrified by the black rebellion. The American rulers are terrified of the black uprising and are using even more extensive terrorist activities to suppress blacks.”

After exposing the brutal oppression and exploitation of blacks by American white racists, the statement pointed out that the American ruling class has always tried to deceive the black masses in the U.S. with tricks like the so-called “Civil Rights Act,” attempting to extinguish the fiery struggle of American blacks for liberation. The statement said: “American blacks have seen some ‘civil rights’ laws in the past, but the situation has only gotten worse. As long as the capitalist system exists, blacks will not be free. People are gradually realizing that ‘desegregation’ does not change this system, it will not give black laborers a beautiful, free life.” The statement emphasized: “People should rise up against the ruling class.”

The statement calls on the black masses to “build an unbreakable organization” to carry out planned, long-term struggles until the enemy is defeated. The statement pointed out: “We must choose our own leaders. Our leaders must be such brothers and sisters whose actions show that their goal is to use the destruction of American imperialism’s racist system to strive for black liberation with all their might.”

The statement calls on the black masses to oppose the conscription of black youth, to organize resistance against police brutality, and to defend themselves with any necessary means.

The statement said that the oppressed peoples of the world are advancing bravely, smashing our common enemy from all sides through powerful struggles.

The statement calls on the black masses to arm themselves with the theory of socialist revolution to better fight.

The Progressive Labor Party of the U.S. emphasized in the statement that Chairman Mao has written outstanding works on people’s liberation.

The statement concluded: “We have fighting spirit. We have heroes. Now we need clear thinking, need to organize, need clear plans. These factors have led other places’ liberation struggles to victory. Fighting spirit plus in-depth study of revolutionary theory – plus organizational work – will finally bring us liberation and complete freedom.”

    美进步劳工党发表声明欢呼美国黑人造反火焰愈烧愈旺
    美国黑人只有消灭美帝才能彻底解放
    新华社十七日讯　纽约消息：美国进步劳工党全国委员会最近就美国黑人抗暴斗争发表声明指出：“黑人正在抛弃马丁·路德·金的非暴力主义。黑人知道世界上最暴虐的压迫者是美帝国主义，而且他们懂得从美帝国主义统治下得到解放的唯一办法就是消灭美帝国主义。”
    声明强调说：“在全国各地，他们（按指黑人群众）已经行动起来，不是作为‘和平的抗议者’行动起来，而是作为愤怒的战士行动起来。他们以这种愤怒的行动唾弃了美国是一个所谓民主国家的谎言。”
    声明指出：“革命不仅在越南发生！造反的火焰就在这里也正在燃烧！黑人的这些大规模的、英雄的行动证明黑人的解放斗争不是昙花一现，而是日益高涨！黑人的解放行动正在证明，马丁·路德·金的错误的非暴力主义的主张，已同他一道被埋葬了。”
    声明说：“华盛顿这个策划对全世界使用暴力的地方，被成千上万勇于战斗的黑人弄得动弹不得。于是约翰逊下令派坦克和机关枪来挽救白官。他和他的伙伴被黑人的造反吓破了胆。”“美国统治者对黑人的起义怕得要死，正在用更大规模的恐怖活动来镇压黑人。”
    声明在揭露美国白人种族主义者对黑人进行残酷压迫和剥削后指出，美国统治集团一直企图以所谓“民权法案”之类的花招来欺骗美国黑人群众，妄想以此来扑灭美国黑人求解放的斗争烈火。声明说：“美国黑人过去曾经看到通过一些‘民权’法案，但是情况变得更坏了。”“只要资本主义制度存在，黑人就不可能有自由。”“人们渐渐认识到，‘取消种族隔离’改变不了这个制度，它不会使黑人劳动人民得到美好的、自由的生活。”声明强调说：“人们应当起来对抗统治阶级。”
    声明要求黑人群众“建立起牢不可破的组织”，以便进行有计划的、长期的斗争，直到把敌人打败为止。声明指出：“我们必须自己选择我们的领袖。我们的领袖必须是这样的兄弟姐妹，他们的行动表明，他们的目的，是要用摧毁美帝国主义种族主义制度的办法，来尽一切力量求得黑人解放。”
    声明号召黑人群众反对征召黑人青年入伍，对警察暴行进行有组织的抵抗，并以任何必要的手段保卫自己。
    声明说，全世界的被压迫人民正在奋勇前进，通过声势浩大的斗争，从四面八方粉碎我们的共同敌人。
    声明号召黑人群众要用社会主义革命的学说来武装自己，以便更好地斗争。
    美国进步劳工党在声明中强调指出，毛主席“写下了关于人民解放的卓越著作”。
    声明最后说：“我们有斗志。我们有英雄。现在我们需要明确的思想，需要组织起来，需要明确的计划，这些因素已把其他地方的解放斗争引向胜利。战斗性加上对革命理论的深入学习——再加上组织工作，将使我们终于获得解放和完全的自由。”
