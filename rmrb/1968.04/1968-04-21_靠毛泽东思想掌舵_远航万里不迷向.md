Steering with Mao Zedong Thought for a Voyage of Ten Thousand Miles Without Losing Direction

The naval unit commander, Wu Yi

The Chinese Khrushchev has always opposed the use of Mao Zedong Thought to build a strong people's navy. In 1955, under the guise of inspecting the navy, he proposed the black slogan of "only by mastering technology can we defend the country." He attempted to replace proletarian political construction with bourgeois technical construction, using the contradiction between people and technology to cover up and erase the struggle between the two military construction lines. He tried to lead our people's army onto the path of a bourgeois army.

The great teacher Chairman Mao teaches us: politics is the commander, the soul. He also said, "The foundation of the army lies in the soldiers. Without the progressive political spirit permeating the army and without progressive political work to carry out this permeation, it is impossible to achieve true unity between officers and soldiers, to arouse the maximum anti-war enthusiasm of officers and soldiers, and to make the best use of all tactics and strategies." Our army has always relied on people's awareness, bravery, and proletarian political leadership. The political awareness of the troops is the foundation for mastering and utilizing military technology and is the primary factor in the various elements of our army's combat effectiveness. This is a universal truth proven by our army's decades of construction experience.

In recent years, our unit has remembered Chairman Mao's teachings, firmly implemented Vice Chairman Lin's instructions, and resolutely resisted the bourgeois military line that the Chinese Khrushchev promoted in the navy. We have carried out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, firmly grasped the implementation of the "Four Firsts," and promoted the "Three-Eight Style." The unit has a strong political atmosphere, high morale, and has achieved great success in combat readiness training and various other tasks. The practice of struggle has made us feel from the heart that nothing is more important than building the military with Mao Zedong Thought. Naval vessels are technically complex, but with Mao Zedong Thought at the helm, we can sail ten thousand miles without losing our way. No matter how technology and equipment change, we must always emphasize proletarian politics. No matter how complex the situation is, we must never waver from the path of emphasizing politics for even a moment.

A fast boat sailing on the sea needs a compass, but the most important thing is to rely on Mao Zedong Thought to guide the revolutionary course. In 1963, we were tasked with the honorable mission of a long-distance voyage. At that time, there were two different opinions: a few comrades believed that sailing more than 200 nautical miles away from the island was unprecedented, and there was no guarantee whether the direction would be off, whether the fuel would be sufficient, or whether the boat's wave resistance would be enough, especially at night, the difficulties were even greater. Most comrades believed that we should not only see the material factors but also see the human factors. As Chairman Mao taught, "Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, any human miracle can be created." Our party committee believed that the essence of this debate was whether we dared to revolutionize and dared to take the path that no one had taken before. We affirmed the significance of this long-distance voyage and resolutely led the boat squadron on the voyage. At that time, we encountered many difficulties during the voyage. We firmly grasped the lifeline of political work, repeatedly propagated the great significance of the long-distance voyage to everyone, and together with the officers and soldiers, promoted democracy, with everyone thinking of solutions and offering suggestions. All officers and soldiers studied more than ten measures to ensure safe sailing, and each measure was the result of everyone using Mao Zedong Thought to analyze the situation. Once a problem was found with the machine or an abnormal sound was heard, effective measures were taken to ensure the normal operation of the machine. Every five minutes, the position of the boat was calculated to ensure that the direction did not deviate. As a result, one difficulty after another was overcome. After nineteen hours of night struggle, the long-distance voyage was successfully completed, creating a precedent in the history of fast boat sailing. This is the most vivid and concrete education of Chairman Mao's military thought. Whether the direction is off or not mainly depends on whether our ideological direction is off or not; whether the fuel is sufficient or not mainly depends on whether our revolutionary spirit is sufficient or not; whether the boat's wave resistance is enough or not mainly depends on whether our ideological and political work is done enough. In a word: the human factor comes first, the political factor comes first. With Mao Zedong Thought and a high level of class consciousness, technical strength can be fully utilized, and we can be invincible.

A fast boat needs to launch torpedoes to destroy enemy ships. However, launching torpedoes requires human control, and only those armed with Mao Zedong Thought can make the torpedoes exert their maximum power. In the "August 6" naval battle in which our unit participated, all officers and soldiers, with a loyal heart to Chairman Mao and deep hatred for the enemy, showed an unparalleled fighting spirit in the battle. In the brother units, heroes like Mai Xiande emerged. In our fast boat unit, many brave combat stories also emerged. Heroic fast boat crew member and new soldier Han Jie, during the encounter with the enemy, suddenly found that the torpedo air valve was malfunctioning. He calmly took evasive measures, eliminated the fault, and ensured the launch of the torpedo. The engine room chief, Liang Zhenxiang, was wounded in the leg, and his body swayed. The commander asked him, and he firmly replied that he was not injured and continued to stand on the bridge, insisting on operation. The radio operator, Shi Suocai, had the key broken during the battle and cleverly used the pen on the meter as a substitute key, ensuring uninterrupted communication and command between the fast boat and the base, and was the first to send the victory report to the command department. During the entire battle, each boat showed brave and decisive combat actions, fought close combat, and dared to engage in hand-to-hand combat. The boat captain, Xu Yongjiang, braved the enemy's artillery fire and obstruction, sending the torpedo to the closest distance to the enemy ship before launching it. It was with this brave and tenacious fighting spirit that we, together with the brother units, achieved the great victory of sinking two American-made Kuomintang ships. This is not a display of technical strength but a shining example of the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. No matter how large the enemy ships are or how good their equipment is, they cannot escape the fate of being eaten by the warriors armed with Mao Zedong Thought using small boats. This small boat defeating a large ship, the weak overcoming the strong, is an unthinkable miracle in the eyes of bourgeois authorities. Only revolutionaries armed with Mao Zedong Thought can think of it and do it. This iron-clad fact eloquently proves: the best weapon is not an airplane, not a cannon, not a tank, not an atomic bomb, but the boundless Mao Zedong Thought. This is our unique, invincible, and most powerful spiritual atomic bomb.

"Weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor; the decisive factor is people, not things." Technology, weapons, and equipment are indeed important, but weapons are made by people and used by people. The application of technology depends on the spiritual state of people. With a brave and fearless spirit, one can fight with technology, fight with wisdom, turn passivity into activity, and confidently overcome difficulties and defeat strong enemies. Without bravery, even the best weapons cannot function. Therefore, using Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, emphasizing proletarian politics, and carrying out the ideological transformation of people is the fundamental principle of our military construction.

Using the great Mao Zedong Thought to dissect the Chinese Khrushchev's so-called "technology decides everything" fallacy, it can be seen that it is a piece of junk from the bourgeois military line. He dared to negate our army's glorious tradition of winning battles with proletarian politics, deny that the human factor comes first, and only see technology, steel, machinery, and weapons. He wants to turn the broad masses of officers and soldiers into mechanical "wooden people" without revolutionary initiative, and into confused "technical fanatics" who do not care about politics and do not pay attention to national affairs. Following this path, the troops will deviate from the track of Mao Zedong Thought and turn our people's army into a tool for these ambitious, conspiratorial, and counter-revolutionary two-faced traitors to seize the party and the military. This is obviously a pipe dream. We will defend Chairman Mao's military line to the death, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly emphasize proletarian politics, and forever follow the revolutionary course opened by Chairman Mao, advancing more bravely through the waves!

    靠毛泽东思想掌舵　远航万里不迷向
    海军某部队部队长　武毅
    中国赫鲁晓夫一贯反对用毛泽东思想建设一支强大的人民海军。一九五五年，他以视察海军为名，抛出了一个“只有学好技术，才能保卫国防”的黑题词。他妄图用资产阶级的技术建军来代替无产阶级的政治建军，用人和技术的矛盾来掩盖、抹煞两条建军路线的斗争，妄图把我们人民军队引上资产阶级军队的道路。
    伟大导师毛主席教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂。又说：“军队的基础在士兵，没有进步的政治精神贯注于军队之中，没有进步的政治工作去执行这种贯注，就不能达到真正的官长和士兵的一致，就不能激发官兵最大限度的抗战热忱，一切技术和战术就不能得着最好的基础去发挥它们应有的效力。”我军历来靠人的觉悟，靠勇敢，靠无产阶级政治挂帅。部队的政治觉悟是掌握和发挥军事技术的基础，是我军战斗力诸因素中的首要因素。这是我军几十年建设的经验证明了的普遍真理。
    几年来，我们部队牢记毛主席的教导，坚决贯彻林副主席的指示，坚决抵制中国赫鲁晓夫在海军推行的资产阶级建军路线，深入开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，狠抓四个第一的落实，大兴三八作风。部队政治空气浓厚，斗志旺盛，战备训练和各项工作都取得很大的成绩。斗争的实践，使我们从内心感到，千重要，万重要，按毛泽东思想建军最重要。舰艇技术复杂，靠毛泽东思想掌舵，就远航万里不迷向；不管技术装备怎样变化，突出无产阶级政治不能变；无论情况多么复杂，走突出政治的道路一时一刻也不能动摇。
    快艇在海上航行要有罗经，可是，最重要的还是要靠毛泽东思想来把革命的航道指引。一九六三年，我们担负远航的光荣任务。当时出现两种不同意见：少数同志认为，快艇远离岛岸二百浬以上航行，是没有先例的，航向偏不偏，燃料足不足，艇只耐波力够不够，都没有把握，尤其是夜间航行，困难更大。多数同志则认为，不能只看到物的因素，更重要的要看到人的因素。正如毛主席教导的那样：“在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来。”我们党委认为，这两种意见的争论，实质上是敢不敢革命，敢不敢走前人没有走过的道路的问题。我们肯定了这次远航的意义，毅然率领艇队远航。当时，航行遇到很多的困难。我们紧紧地抓住政治工作这条生命线，反复地向大家宣传远航任务的伟大意义，和指战员一起，发扬民主，人人想办法、出主意。全体指战员研究出了十多条保证安全航行的措施，每一条措施，都是大家用毛泽东思想分析情况的结果。一旦发现机器有一点毛病或产生不正常的声音，都采取有力的措施，保证机器正常运转。每隔五分钟，计算一次艇的位置以保证航向不偏。结果一个一个困难都被战胜。经过十九个小时的夜间奋战，保证了远航的胜利，开创了快艇航行史上的先例。这是最生动最具体的毛主席建军思想的教育。什么航向偏不偏，主要还是看我们思想航向偏不偏；什么燃料足不足，主要还是看我们革命干劲足不足；什么艇只耐波力够不够，主要还是看我们思想政治工作做得够不够。一句话：人的因素第一，政治因素第一。有了毛泽东思想，有了高度的阶级觉悟，技术力量就能最充分地发挥出来，无往而不胜。
    快艇消灭敌舰要施放鱼雷。但是，施放鱼雷要由人来掌握，只有用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，才能使鱼雷发挥最大的威力。在我部队参加的“八·六”海战中，全体指战员怀着对毛主席的一颗忠心，怀着对敌人的刻骨仇恨，在海战中表现出了有我无敌的战斗精神。在兄弟部队中，出现了麦贤得等同志的英雄榜样。在我们快艇部队中，也涌现出许多勇敢作战的动人事迹。英雄快艇艇员、新战士韩杰同志，在接敌中，鱼雷锁气阀突然发生故障。他沉着冷静地采取机动措施，排除了故障，保证了鱼雷发射。轮机长梁镇祥，腿部中弹负伤，身体摇晃了一下。指挥员问他，他坚定地回答，没有负伤，继续屹立在驾驶台上坚持操作。电讯手石锁才，战斗中电键被震坏了，就机智灵活地使用电表上的电笔代作电键使用，保证了快艇和基地的不间断联系指挥，并且第一个把胜利的捷报发往指挥部。在整个作战过程中，各艇以勇猛果敢的战斗动作，打近战，敢于刺刀见红。艇长许永江，冒着敌人的炮火阻拦，把鱼雷一直送到距离敌舰最近的地方才发射出去。我们就是靠的这种英勇顽强的战斗精神，协同兄弟部队取得了击沉两艘美制蒋舰的伟大胜利。这里绝不是什么技术力量的表现，而是闪射出毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉。不管敌舰多大，装备多好，硬是逃脱不了毛泽东思想武装起来的战士用小艇把它们吃掉的命运。这种小艇打大舰，劣势胜优势，在资产阶级权威眼里是不可思议的奇闻，只有用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士才能想得到，做得到。这个铁的事实雄辩地证明：最好的武器不是飞机，不是大炮，不是坦克，不是原子弹，而是光焰无际的毛泽东思想。这是我们独有的永远不可战胜的威力最大的精神原子弹。
      “武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。”技术、武器、装备固然重要，但是武器是人制造出来的，又是人使用的。技术的发挥，取决于人的精神状态。有了勇敢不怕死的精神，就能打出技术，打出智慧，变被动为主动，满怀信心地去战胜困难，打败强敌。人不勇敢，再好的武器也不能发挥作用。所以，用毛泽东思想挂帅，突出无产阶级政治，搞好人的思想革命化，是我们建军的根本。
    用伟大的毛泽东思想解剖中国赫鲁晓夫所谓技术“决定一切”的谬论，就可以看出它是一种资产阶级军事路线的破烂货。他狗胆包天地要否定我军靠无产阶级政治打胜仗的光荣传统，否认人的因素第一，眼里只有技术、钢铁、机械、武器，要把广大的指战员变成没有革命首创精神的机械的“木头人”，变成不问政治，不关心国家大事的思想糊涂的“技术迷”。按照这条路子，部队就会离开毛泽东思想的轨道，从而把我们人民军队和平演变成他们这些野心家、阴谋家、反革命两面派篡党篡军的御用工具。这当然是白天作梦。我们誓死捍卫毛主席的建军路线，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，坚决突出无产阶级政治，永远沿着毛主席开辟的革命航道，更加勇猛地破浪前进！
