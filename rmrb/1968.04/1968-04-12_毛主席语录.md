	Chairman Mao's Quotations

	The basic experiences of revolutionary committees have three points: one is to have representatives of revolutionary cadres, one is to have representatives of the army, and one is to have representatives of revolutionary masses, realizing the three-in-one combination of the revolution. The revolutionary committees should implement unified leadership, break down the overlapping administrative organs, streamline administration and personnel, and organize a revolutionary leading corps that is in close contact with the masses.
