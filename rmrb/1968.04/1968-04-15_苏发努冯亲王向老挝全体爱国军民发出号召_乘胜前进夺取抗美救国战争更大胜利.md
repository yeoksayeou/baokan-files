Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, issued a call to all Lao soldiers and civilians on the occasion of the Lao New Year (April 13) to press onwards and achieve even greater and continuous victories in the anti-American national salvation war.

Prince Souphanouvong said that over the past year, especially since the beginning of the 1967-1968 dry season, the Lao patriotic soldiers and civilians have continuously and proactively struck the enemy on battlefields from the upper to the lower regions, achieving great victories that have struck fear into the enemy. In just the first five months of the 1967-1968 dry season, from November 1967 to March 1968, the Lao patriotic soldiers and civilians annihilated over 10,000 enemy troops, shot down and destroyed more than 90 American aircraft, and reclaimed vast areas previously illegally occupied by the enemy, liberating tens of thousands of people. The number of enemy troops annihilated in these five months is equivalent to two-thirds of the total enemy troops annihilated in the entire year of 1967.

Prince Souphanouvong said that in addition to military victories, we have also achieved great victories in all other aspects. The liberated areas have been further consolidated and built up. Our compatriots of various ethnic groups, who have been deceived, persecuted, and suppressed by American imperialism and its reactionary lackeys, have grown even more resentful of them, and thus have united more closely and risen up to fight against them.

Prince Souphanouvong said that our victories have great significance. They have changed the balance of power in our favor, giving us new strength and favorable conditions to launch offensive attacks against the enemy and achieve victory.

Prince Souphanouvong then pointed out that we are fully aware that American imperialism and its lackeys, before suffering a complete defeat, will still make desperate struggles. Therefore, our people's struggle for national salvation against American imperialism will still have to overcome many difficulties and hardships before achieving complete victory.

Prince Souphanouvong called on all Lao patriotic soldiers and civilians to clearly understand the new situation, new victories, and new favorable conditions, to recognize the vicious plots of American imperialism and its lackeys, to unite more closely, to fully carry forward the national tradition of bravery, to resolutely, fiercely, continuously, and comprehensively attack the enemy, to rapidly strengthen our forces in all aspects, and to make the new year a year of great victories.

    苏发努冯亲王向老挝全体爱国军民发出号召
    乘胜前进夺取抗美救国战争更大胜利
    新华社康开十四日电　据巴特寮通讯社报道：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席苏发努冯亲王，在老挝新年（四月十三日）的时候向老挝全国军民发表祝词，号召老挝全国军民乘胜前进，在抗美救国战争中夺取更加巨大和连续的胜利。
    苏发努冯亲王说，一年来，尤其是进入一九六七—一九六八年旱季以来，老挝爱国军民在从上寮到下寮的各个战场上连续和主动地打击敌人，建立了巨大的战功，使敌人惊恐万状。仅在一九六七年十一月到一九六八年三月的旱季头五个月中，老挝爱国军民就消灭敌人一万多名，击落击毁美国飞机九十多架，收复了敌人过去非法侵占的广大地区，解放了数万人民。这五个月的歼敌数字相当于一九六七年全年歼敌总数的三分之二。
    苏发努冯亲王说，在过去一年里，除了军事方面的胜利以外，我们在各方面也取得了巨大胜利。解放区得到进一步巩固和建设。被美帝国主义及其反动走狗集团欺骗、迫害和镇压的各族同胞，更加仇恨它们，从而更加紧密团结，奋起斗争反对它们。
    苏发努冯亲王说，我们的胜利具有重大的意义，它使敌我双方的力量对比发生了有利于我们的变化，使我们具有了新的力量和顺利条件，以主动进攻敌人，夺取胜利。
    苏发努冯亲王接着指出，我们清楚地懂得，美帝国主义及其走狗在遭到彻底失败之前，还要进行疯狂的挣扎。因此，我国人民的抗美救国斗争，还要克服许多艰难困苦，才能取得彻底胜利。
    苏发努冯亲王号召老挝全国爱国军民必须认清新形势、新胜利和新的顺利条件，认清美帝国主义及其走狗的恶毒阴谋，更加紧密团结，大力发扬民族的英勇传统，坚决猛烈地、连续地和全面地进攻敌人，使自己各方面的力量迅速地壮大起来，使新的一年成为大胜利年。
