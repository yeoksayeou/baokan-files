The two running dogs of the American imperialists, the fascist military clique led by Suharto, under the orders of their masters, have recently been frequently visiting the political corpse despised by the Chinese people—the Chiang Kai-shek clique—and are getting along like a house on fire.

According to reports from the Chiang clique's newspapers, after Suharto self-proclaimed himself "president" on March 27, he eagerly sent a "trade" delegation to Taiwan on March 31 to carry out counter-revolutionary, anti-China, anti-people activities. Under the instigation of American imperialism, this "trade" delegation and the Chiang clique reached an agreement, with the Chiang clique lending $1 million to the Suharto fascist military clique, and stipulating that this loan is guaranteed by American banks. The head of the Indonesian "trade" delegation, Soehadi Man, raved in Taipei that this deal between Indonesia and the Chiang clique is important for their cooperation in "opposing communism." The Chiang clique's newspapers even more blatantly said that this trade loan has built a bridge for the political and economic collusion between the Chiang clique and the Suharto fascist military clique, "and the political gains may be twice as significant as the economic meaning." To further their collusion in political, economic, and military aspects, the Chiang Kai-shek clique and the Suharto fascist military clique are also preparing to open a cargo ship route between Taiwan and Indonesia. The Chiang clique's "China Airlines" is actively working to open a new route between Taipei and Jakarta.

Before this, the Indonesian fascist military regime had also sent an "Islamic delegation" and a "news delegation" to Taiwan to engage in conspiracies. The head of the "news delegation," Rasdi, even openly went to Jinmen to spy on our mainland and issued frenzied anti-China rants.

    两条美国走狗加紧勾结打得火热
    苏哈托派代表团到台湾同蒋匪帮大做交易
    新华社六日讯　美帝、苏修共同豢养的走卒——以苏哈托为首的印尼法西斯军人集团，在它的主子们的指使下，近来与被中国人民唾弃了的政治僵尸——蒋介石匪帮来往频繁，打得火热。
    据蒋帮报纸报道，苏哈托三月二十七日自封“总统”以后，就迫不及待地于三月三十一日派遣“贸易”代表团到台湾进行反华、反共和反人民的反革命罪恶活动。在美帝国主义策动下，这个“贸易”代表团和蒋匪帮达成所谓协议，由蒋帮贷款一千万美元给苏哈托法西斯军人集团，并规定，此项贷款由美国银行担保。印尼
  “贸易”代表团的头目苏哈迪曼在台北疯狂叫嚷，印尼和蒋帮这笔交易，对于他们之间在“反对共产主义方面的合作是重要的”。蒋帮报纸则更加露骨地说，这项贸易贷款为蒋匪帮和苏哈托法西斯军人集团之间的政治、经济勾结搭了桥梁，“而政治上的收获可能犹倍于经济上的意义”。为了配合其政治、经济、军事等方面的进一步勾结，蒋介石匪帮和苏哈托法西斯军人集团还准备开辟台湾、印尼之间的货轮航线。蒋匪帮的“中华航空公司”正在为开辟台北、雅加达新航线而奔走钻营。
    在此之前，印尼法西斯军人政权派到台湾进行阴谋活动的，还有“伊斯兰教代表团”、“新闻代表团”等。“新闻代表团”的头目拉斯迪还公然跑到金门窥伺我国大陆，并发出猖狂的反华叫嚣。
