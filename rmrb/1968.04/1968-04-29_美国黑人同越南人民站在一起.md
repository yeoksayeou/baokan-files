	African Americans Stand with the Vietnamese People

	While the broad masses of African Americans are waging a heroic struggle against racial oppression and for their own liberation, they are increasingly participating in the struggle against U.S. aggression in Vietnam.

	The broad masses of African Americans, who suffer from both national oppression and class exploitation, are increasingly aware through their own experiences that they and the white working people in the United States are victims of the U.S. ruling class's policy of aggression in Vietnam. Their interests are the same as those of the Vietnamese people and the oppressed people of the world. The Johnson administration, which is responsible for the bloody massacres in Vietnam and other places, is also the murderer of black and white working people in the United States. Therefore, African Americans participating in anti-war demonstrations are increasingly loudly shouting the slogans, "Stop the dirty war in Vietnam" and "The struggle in Vietnam and Watts (a black neighborhood) is the same struggle."

	Based on the growing participation of African Americans in anti-war demonstrations, anti-war organizations among African Americans have been emerging in various parts of the United States, and anti-war demonstrations by African Americans have been increasing. In April 1965, at a demonstration in Washington demanding "an immediate end to the Vietnam War," one-tenth of the participants were African Americans. Some African American organizations also participated in the leadership of this demonstration. In February 1966, at the initiative of some African American groups, more than ten major cities in the southern United States held demonstrations of varying sizes against the U.S. aggression in Vietnam on the same day. In the southern United States, where the African American population is concentrated, such widespread protests against the aggressive policies of their own government are unprecedented in U.S. history. In April and October 1967, the broad masses of Americans launched two unprecedented large-scale anti-war demonstrations. In the demonstration in New York, there was a contingent mainly composed of African Americans, who marched under the banner of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, holding placards that read: "Blacks should fight against white racists, not against the freedom fighters of Vietnam!" At the rally of the demonstrators in Washington, a black representative publicly called on black soldiers in Vietnam to "lay down their arms and return home to fight here."

	In many important cities in the north and south of the United States, the struggle of black youth against conscription is also developing, which is a prominent feature of the current struggle of African Americans against the U.S. aggression in Vietnam.

	In the face of the defeat and increasing casualties in the Vietnam War, the U.S. ruling class is desperately trying to force the millions of unemployed and jobless black youth crowded in the slums to go to South Vietnam to fight for its aggressive policies. Although African Americans make up only 11 percent of the total U.S. population, they account for about 25 percent of the U.S. troops in Vietnam. The Johnson administration's vicious tactics have provoked strong resistance from African American youth. More and more black youth solemnly declare that they would rather go to jail than become mercenaries for U.S. imperialism to kill their Vietnamese brothers. They refuse to serve in the military, burn their draft cards, and drive away recruiters. Many black soldiers who have already enlisted also defy military law and refuse to be tools of U.S. imperialism's killing machine.

	The struggle of African Americans against violence and the struggle of the broad masses of people from all walks of life in the United States against the aggression in Vietnam are a great support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

### 美国黑人同越南人民站在一起

    美国黑人同越南人民站在一起
    美国广大黑人群众在进行反对种族压迫、争取自身解放的英勇斗争的同时，正越来越广泛地开展反对美国侵略越南的斗争。
    身受民族压迫和阶级剥削双重痛苦的美国广大黑人，从亲身体会中越来越清楚地认识到，他们和美国白人劳动群众，都是美国统治集团侵越政策的受害者，他们同越南人民和全世界被压迫人民的利益是一致的；在越南和其他地方血腥屠杀被压迫人民的约翰逊政府，也正是在美国残酷压迫黑人和白人劳动群众的凶手。因此，参加反对侵越战争示威的黑人群众，越来越响亮地喊出了“制止在越南进行的肮脏战争”、“越南和瓦茨区（黑人）从事同一斗争”的口号。
    在黑人群众日益广泛参加反对侵越战争示威的基础上，美国各地黑人反对侵越战争的组织不断涌现，黑人群众的反战示威日益增多。一九六五年四月，在华盛顿举行的要求“立即结束越南战争”的示威中，有十分之一的参加者是黑人，有些黑人组织还参与了这次示威的组织领导工作。一九六六年二月，在一些黑人团体的推动下，十多个美国南部重要城市在同一天举行了规模不等的反对侵越战争的示威。在黑人人口集中的美国南部，举行这样广泛的针对本国政府的侵略政策的抗议活动，这在美国历史上还是第一次。一九六七年四月和十月，美国广大人民掀起了两次规模空前的反战示威斗争。在纽约群众的示威队伍中，有一支主要由黑人群众组成的队伍，他们以越南南方民族解放阵线的大旗为前导，高举着标语牌，上面写着：“黑人应该同白人种族主义者作战，不应该同越南的自由战士作战！”在华盛顿示威群众举行的大会上，一位黑人代表公开号召侵越美军中的黑人士兵，“放下武器回到国内，在这里进行战斗”。
    在美国北部和南部许多重要城市的贫民区里，黑人青年反征兵斗争也在日益发展，这是当前美国黑人反对侵越战争斗争的一个明显的特点。
    在侵越战争惨败、伤亡激增的情况下，美国统治集团竭力诱迫拥塞在贫民窟里的千千万万失学失业、生活无着的黑人青年到南越去为它的侵略政策卖命。尽管黑人在美国总人口中只占百分之十一，但是在侵越美军中，黑人却占了约百分之二十五。约翰逊政府的这种歹毒作法，激起了美国黑人青年的强烈反抗。越来越多的黑人青年严正宣告：他们宁愿坐牢，也决不替美帝国主义者充当雇佣兵去杀害越南兄弟。他们纷纷拒绝服兵役，烧毁征兵证，赶走征兵人员。不少已经入了伍的黑人士兵，也不顾军法制裁，拒绝充当美帝国主义的杀人工具。
    美国黑人抗暴斗争和有美国各个阶层人民广泛参加的反对侵略越南的斗争，是对越南人民抗美救国斗争的一个巨大的支援。
