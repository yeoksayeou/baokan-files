The Lan Kiao County Revolutionary Committee—this revolutionary government, born amidst the fierce struggle between two classes, two lines, and two paths, takes loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line as the guiding principle for all its actions. Taking Comrade Jiao Yulu, a good student of Chairman Mao, as its model, it emphasizes proletarian politics, vigorously promotes ideological revolutionization, and carries forward the spirit of hard struggle and close ties with the masses. In the hearts of the 380,000 people of Lan Kiao County, it has become a revolutionary, representative, authoritative, and vibrant proletarian revolutionary command center.

Breaking Private Interests and Establishing Public Interests: Vigorously Promoting Ideological Revolutionization

From the moment the Lan Kiao County Revolutionary Committee was established, it focused on the ideological revolutionization of its leadership. They took the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as their guiding principles, broke private interests, and thoroughly transformed their worldviews. On the day the committee was established, they discussed and passed the "Regulations on Maintaining the Spirit of Hard Struggle and Preventing the Infiltration of Bourgeois Ideology." The next day, all the committee members gathered at Comrade Jiao Yulu's grave to take an oath. They resolved to follow Comrade Jiao Yulu's example, to be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, to dedicate themselves to the people and the revolution, and to carry forward the spirit of hard struggle.

The Lan Kiao County Revolutionary Committee first focused on class struggle education within the leadership. They believed that a vibrant revolutionary committee could only be consolidated and developed in the struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie. Therefore, whether in standing committee meetings or full committee meetings, they seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Because of victory, arrogance within the Party, the tendency to consider oneself a hero, the tendency to stop progressing, the tendency to enjoy pleasures and not want to live a hard life, may grow... There may be some communists who have not been defeated by enemies with guns; they are heroes in front of these enemies; but they cannot withstand the sugar-coated bullets of the enemy. They will be defeated in front of sugar bullets. We must prevent this situation." They frequently sounded the alarm against the infiltration of bourgeois sugar-coated bullets, frequently analyzed the new situations and characteristics of class struggle, reviewed the historical lessons of some cadres who had degenerated, and further heightened their revolutionary awareness of anti-revisionism and anti-degeneration. They deeply felt: "Prison chains are not scary, chopsticks can knock people down. Whether to be thoroughly revolutionary or half-revolutionary, everyone faces a new and severe test."

"Those who deliberately plan to become revisionists are few, but those who unknowingly become revisionists are many." The comrades of the Lan Kiao County Revolutionary Committee paid great attention to igniting a revolution in their souls and building an iron wall of anti-revisionism and anti-degeneration in their minds. They focused on major issues but never overlooked what people often ignore as "small matters." They used Mao Zedong Thought to observe, analyze, guide, and transform everything. Once, during a standing committee meeting, a revolutionary mass representative wore a damp shirt that hadn't dried yet. Why was this? It turned out that the comrade had worked the previous day, and the shirt had some dirt on it. Fearing that wearing a "dirty" shirt to the meeting would be laughed at, he wore the damp shirt that had been washed but not dried. Although the matter was small, the standing committee members compared it to Chairman Mao's teachings about "the cleanest are the workers and peasants, even though their hands are black and their feet have cow dung..." They elevated this incident to the level of whether to maintain the essence of the working people. With the help of everyone, the comrade realized that it was not his shirt that was dirty, but his mind that had been contaminated. If not vigilant, this could become the beginning of a change in color. This incident also gave the standing committee members a vivid lesson in Mao Zedong Thought.

To maintain good work styles, the comrades of the Lan Kiao County Revolutionary Committee learned from the People's Liberation Army's Three-Eight Work Style, frequently carried out criticism and self-criticism, and corrected mistakes according to Chairman Mao's teachings: "To honestly admit mistakes to the masses and correct them immediately." In November of last year, the Lan Kiao No. 2 Middle School was to establish a revolutionary committee. The "August 18th" revolutionary youngsters of this school braved the wind and rain, walked over 70 miles to the county revolutionary committee, requesting funds for the meeting. County Revolutionary Committee Chairman Zhang Qingli felt that this was the first middle school in the county to establish a revolutionary committee and should be enthusiastically supported, so he allocated some money to them. However, when other standing committee members thought this did not align with Chairman Mao's teachings on "frugality for revolution," he realized he had made a mistake and immediately made a self-criticism at the standing committee meeting. He also made a self-criticism to the "August 18th" youngsters of the No. 2 Middle School and in other meetings. Zhang Qingli thus strictly required himself, set an example, and acted in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions. He often said: "Loyalty to Chairman Mao means not becoming arrogant with achievements; with mistakes, carry out criticism and self-criticism, resolutely correct, thoroughly correct, and quickly correct." He said it and did it.

The revolutionary mass representatives in the Lan Kiao County Revolutionary Committee brought their hardworking and simple lifestyle into the county revolutionary committee. Committee member Yan Xiechong is an old poor peasant who has always been infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and has always struggled hard. To support the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against America, he educated his children to eat coarse grains and save fine grains, to eat more vegetables and less grains, saving 200 pounds of wheat to support the Vietnamese people. Even before the county revolutionary committee was established, under the persecution of the bourgeois reactionary line, his eldest son was tortured to the point of being skin and bones, but he did not touch the 200 pounds of wheat. He said: "Just like plowing, you can't just plow the piece in front of your face. If you don't plow the weeds around, your piece won't be clean. If you don't liberate all the people of the world, you can't hold power well. You can't see all the people of the world, and you can't hold power well." This old poor peasant linked holding proletarian power with the world revolution, and thus could highly consciously carry forward the spirit of hard struggle. The "fire engine" cotton cap on his head is small and worn out, having been used for 25 years. But this year in January, when his wife gave him a few yuan to buy a new cap, he insisted on not buying it. He said: "This cap may not be good, but it has great significance. Seeing it reminds me of the bitterness of the old society and the sweetness of today." Later, he added a few more yuan and bought five sets of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," keeping one set for himself and giving the other four to the four red flag teams that Comrade Jiao Yulu had established during his lifetime. Yan Xiechong's deep class feelings of infinite loyalty to Chairman Mao and his revolutionary spirit of hard struggle deeply moved all the comrades of the revolutionary committee, and they all took Yan Xiechong as a good example to learn from.

Hard Struggle Becomes the Norm: Revolutionary Spirit is Vibrant

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without a firm and correct political direction, it is impossible to arouse the spirit of hard struggle; without the spirit of hard struggle, it is also impossible to carry out a firm and correct political direction." The comrades of the Lan Kiao County Revolutionary Committee believed: whether the revolutionary committee could maintain and carry forward the spirit of hard struggle was a big issue for the proletarian revolutionary faction to hold and use power well. Therefore, as soon as the county revolutionary committee was established, they followed Chairman Mao's teachings, carried forward the spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle, and overcame the financial difficulties caused by the counter-revolutionary economic wind blown by a small group of capitalist roaders within the party. In February of last year, this small group of capitalist roaders within the county party, in order to save their failing fate, blew a counter-revolutionary economic wind, squandering state property at will, and it was estimated that by the end of the year, there would be a large deficit.

Facing this serious problem, the Lan Kiao County Revolutionary Committee believed that this was a class struggle between the proletarian revolutionary faction and a small group of capitalist roaders within the party in the economic field. On one hand, they mobilized the masses to fiercely criticize the "material incentives" and other revisionist goods promoted by China's Khrushchev and his agents in Lan Kiao, thoroughly eliminating the poison of counter-revolutionary economic ideas; on the other hand, they thought of various ways to increase revenue and reduce expenditures, expanding financial income. They firmly followed Chairman Mao's instructions: "Financial expenditures should be based on the principle of economy," insisting on not using money that could be saved, saving money that should be spent, and everything starting from production and economy. The proletarian revolutionary faction of Lan Kiao County, during the "February Countercurrent," had used hemp leaves to roll into pens and mixed ash with water to use as ink to write big-character posters and paint big slogans. The county revolutionary committee called on all the revolutionary masses and cadres in the county to learn from and carry forward this spirit of hard struggle, doing their best to save for the country a drop of oil, a grain of rice, a degree of electricity, and a piece of paper. The revolutionary committee itself also set an example in everything, leading the way in saving for the revolution. After four months of hard struggle, by the end of the year, not only was the financial deficit made up, but there was also a surplus of 613,000 yuan.

The comrades of the Lan Kiao County Revolutionary Committee, like Comrade Jiao Yulu, had the people in their hearts but not themselves. Last winter, the offices and living quarters of the Lan Kiao County Revolutionary Committee did not have fires for warmth. Was it not cold? In the depths of winter, how could it not be cold? The water in the tea pot in the standing committee's duty room had frozen. According to past habits, a fire should have been lit long ago. But they were not thinking about whether they were cold or not, but first considered how the masses were living. One day, a comrade from the affairs group lit a fire in the standing committee's duty room, and a responsible comrade from the revolutionary committee discovered it and said: We are wearing thick cotton clothes, and if we light a fire to warm up, we will warm our skin but cool our hearts! The standing committee discussed this issue and unanimously agreed not to light fires for warmth. Actions speak louder than words. The comrades of the revolutionary committee not only did not light fires for warmth but also led the county direct organs and communes to not light fires for warmth. Thus, they saved all the 50 tons of coal that had been approved for the staff to use for warmth.

One day, a responsible comrade from the county revolutionary committee was going to Zhengzhou for a meeting. At that time, there were only a few minutes left until the train's departure, and the affairs group comrades wanted to send him in a small car, but he firmly refused, put on his backpack, and ran to catch the train. This may seem like a small matter, but in the hearts of the poor and lower-middle peasants, it relates to whether you are an official or a servant of the people. Just as the poor and lower-middle peasants of Lan Kiao County said: "In the past, the capitalist roaders of the county went to the countryside in cars, like officials, and were not on the same wavelength as us; now the people of the revolutionary committee go to the countryside with their own luggage, all running on the ground, and are truly close to our hearts!"

The members of the Lan Kiao County Revolutionary Committee "both serve as officials and as common people," rolling with the masses, working hard and steadily as the people's "old yellow oxen." Committee member Zhao Xinzhen, who was sent down to Qin Zhai Brigade, is a state cadre known as an "indistinguishable" cadre by the masses. This means that his skin is dark, his hands are calloused, and his clothes are coarse, and when he stands among the peasant masses, no one can fail to see him as a genuine farmer. The poor and lower-middle peasants praised him, saying: "Look at our old Zhao, he is said to be a county committee member, but he has no airs, and works with us more diligently and harder than before!" Although Comrade Zhao Xinzhen suffers from a chronic illness, no matter how tired the work is or how late he sleeps, he often gets up before dawn, picks up the broom, and sweeps from the west end of the street to the east end. The comrades of the revolutionary committee, like Comrade Jiao Yulu, appear before the masses when they are most in need. Every time there is heavy snow or strong winds, visiting the poor and asking about their difficulties has become their new habit.

Close Ties with the Masses: Continuously Transforming Oneself

Only by closely tying with the masses and deeply understanding them can one, with profound proletarian feelings, carry forward the spirit of hard struggle and better serve the people. Just as Chairman Mao teaches: "We must never leave the masses. In this way, we can know the masses, understand the masses, and work with the masses, and thus can truly serve the people."

The comrades of the Lan Kiao County Revolutionary Committee deeply understood: leaving the masses means deviating from Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; the closer one is to the masses, the closer one is to Chairman Mao, and the higher the consciousness of acting according to Mao Zedong Thought. They took Comrade Jiao Yulu as their model, doing everything possible to maintain and strengthen the close ties with the 380,000 people of Lan Kiao County. The revolutionary committee implemented division of labor and rotation of duties, personally receiving mass visits, handling mass letters, frequently going to the countryside and factories, deeply entering the reality and the masses. The mass representatives in the revolutionary committee, except for the standing committee members who sometimes take turns on duty, did not leave their original study, production, and work positions.

The location of the revolutionary committee was originally a "Confucian Temple," which was the Japanese puppet county government during the Japanese occupation and the pseudo-prefectural office during the Kuomintang's rule. People called it the "old yamen." Now, it has become the location of the county revolutionary committee. However, some people's old views of this courtyard have not changed. One day, two peasants led a few sheep, walking back and forth in front of the revolutionary committee, asking what place this was and whether they could come in to see. This incident was just seen by a responsible comrade of the revolutionary committee. He immediately enthusiastically said: "This is our county revolutionary committee! Come in, let me take you in to see!" Saying this, he led the two peasants into the courtyard of the revolutionary committee. The comrades of the revolutionary committee gained new inspiration from this incident and took further measures: they moved the peasant representative assembly into the courtyard of the revolutionary committee; they set up a mass reception room in the courtyard of the revolutionary committee. Thus, the revolutionary committee became a place where the poor and lower-middle peasants frequently come and go, and the revolutionary committee opened a channel to timely listen to the opinions of the masses.

Placing oneself under the supervision of the masses, being good at accepting criticism from the masses, is an important driving force for the comrades of the Lan Kiao County Revolutionary Committee to break private interests and establish public interests, prevent the infiltration of bourgeois ideology, and achieve ideological revolutionization. There was a revolutionary mass representative who, after being elected as a standing committee member of the county revolutionary committee, temporarily developed a fear of hardship and dirt, and her collective labor and production were not as solid as before. The poor and lower-middle peasants in the village saw this and took it to heart, and actively found her, speaking earnestly: "In the old society, the landlords did not treat us poor people as human beings. Now that you have become a county committee member, you can represent us poor and lower-middle peasants to speak for the family. This is all thanks to Chairman Mao! You must lead us poor and lower-middle peasants to seize the revolution and promote production!" The poor and lower-middle peasants' sincere help touched her heart. She compared herself to Chairman Mao's teachings, recalled her thoughts after becoming a committee member, and was shocked. She said with deep emotion: "No matter how the position changes, the thoughts of the working people must never change!" From then on, except for participating in necessary meetings, she often participated in collective labor in the team. There was another revolutionary mass representative who, after becoming a committee member, was once infected with the bourgeois ideology of showing off and making a fuss. The worker comrades, in order to help him get rid of this bad ideological sprout, actively had heart-to-heart talks with him and gave him class education. An old worker surnamed Huang reminisced with him about the bitter and sweet times, and when he recalled the tragic scene of begging for food with his mother when he was young, tears flowed. He excitedly said to the old worker: "Please rest assured, I will never forget my roots." He voluntarily took off his woolen coat and leather shoes, changed into ordinary work clothes, and worked with the masses to seize the revolution and promote production.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Cadres, through participating in collective production labor, maintain the broadest, most frequent, and closest ties with the working people. This is a fundamental matter in the socialist system, which helps to overcome bureaucratism, prevent revisionism and dogmatism." The Lan Kiao County Revolutionary Committee followed Chairman Mao's great teachings, making it an inviolable system for cadres to frequently participate in collective production labor, and a big issue for anti-revisionism and anti-degeneration, maintaining and carrying forward the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle, and achieving ideological revolutionization. After the revolutionary committee was established, the standing committee comrades participated in collective production labor for the first time in Xugongzhuang, where Chairman Mao had inspected 15 years ago. The poor and lower-middle peasants there recalled the moving scene of seeing Chairman Mao at that time, always with tears in their eyes and gratitude in their hearts. The 74-year-old old poor peasant Dong Xiande, who had a conversation with Chairman Mao, still remembered the exciting scene vividly. When the standing committee comrades told him that Chairman Mao was in very good health, old man Dong Xiande said excitedly: "Chairman Mao's health is the greatest blessing for all the people of China and the world. I wish him a long life!" The poor and lower-middle peasants' deep class feelings of infinite love, infinite faith, infinite admiration, and infinite loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao deeply inspired the standing committee members present, giving them a vivid and profound class education of loyalty to Chairman Mao.

Many committee members of the revolutionary committee actively led the cadres and masses of their places to participate in collective production labor with vigorous revolutionary enthusiasm. Committee member of the county revolutionary committee and director of the Liufan Commune Luwai Brigade Revolutionary Committee, Tao Yunbin, proposed the slogan "Put down the rickshaw, carry the manure basket," leading the way to carry the manure basket and shoulder the shovel, often fighting with the commune members in the fields. In early March of one year, the commune organized a spring plowing production inspection, and during the short gap when everyone had not arrived, he still insisted on working in the team, seizing every second and not wanting to leave collective production labor for a moment, often rolling with the working people in the great furnace of socialist collective production labor, tempering into steel!

    永葆朝气蓬勃的革命精神
    ——记兰考县革委会艰苦奋斗、密切联系群众的事迹
    兰考县革命委员会——这个在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线激烈搏斗中诞生的革命政权，以忠于伟大领袖毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线为一切行动的准则，以毛主席的好学生焦裕禄同志为榜样，大力突出无产阶级政治，狠抓思想革命化，发扬艰苦奋斗、密切联系群众的革命精神，在兰考县三十八万人民的心目中，成为革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级革命权威的和朝气蓬勃的战斗指挥部。
    破私立公　狠抓思想革命化
    兰考县革命委员会一成立，就狠抓领导班子思想革命化。他们以“老三篇”为座右铭，破私立公，彻底改造自己的世界观。革委会成立的当天，他们就讨论通过了《关于继续保持艰苦奋斗作风，防止资产阶级思想侵蚀的若干制度的规定》。第二天，全体委员又一起到焦裕禄同志的墓前宣誓。他们决心以焦裕禄同志为榜样，无限忠于毛主席，一心为人民，一心为革命，发扬艰苦奋斗的革命精神。
    兰考县革命委员会首先狠抓了领导班子本身的阶级斗争教育。他们认为，朝气蓬勃的革命委员会，只有在无产阶级对资产阶级的胜利斗争中，才能得到巩固和发展。因此，无论开常委会，还是全体委员会，他们都认真地学习毛主席教导的：“因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪，可能生长。……可能有这样一些共产党人，他们是不曾被拿枪的敌人征服过的，他们在这些敌人面前不愧英雄的称号；但是经不起人们用糖衣裹着的炮弹的攻击，他们在糖弹面前要打败仗。我们必须预防这种情况。”他们经常敲起警惕资产阶级糖衣炮弹进攻的警钟，经常分析当前阶级斗争的新形势、新特点，回顾有些干部蜕化变质的历史教训，进一步提高了反修防变的革命自觉性。他们深有体会地说：“监狱镣铐不可怕，筷子头能打倒人。是彻底革命，还是半截革命，每个人都面临着新的严峻考验。”
      “攒着劲变修的人很少，不知不觉变修的大有人在。”兰考县革命委员会的同志们，非常注意在灵魂深处爆发革命，在思想领域里筑起一道反修防变的钢铁长城。他们抓思想革命化，首先抓大节，但也从来不放过被人们忽视的所谓“小事”，用毛泽东思想观察一切，分析一切，指导一切，改造一切。一次开常委会，有个革命群众代表，穿着还没晒干的湿布衫来开会。这是怎么回事呢？原来那位同志前一天劳动，布衫上粘了些泥土，怕穿个“脏”布衫来开会别人笑话，就把洗过还没晒干的湿布衫穿来了。事情虽小，常委同志却对照毛主席关于“最干净的还是工人农民，尽管他们手是黑的，脚上有牛屎……”的教导，把这件事提高到是不是保持劳动人民本色的高度来认识。在大家帮助下，这位同志认识到，不是自己的布衫脏了，而是自己的思想粘上了脏东西。如果不警惕，这就可能成为变颜色的开始。这件事也使常委同志受到了一次生动的毛泽东思想的教育。
    为了保持优良作风，兰考县革委会的同志们，学习人民解放军的三八作风，经常开展批评和自我批评，有了缺点和错误，就按照毛主席“实事求是地公开向群众承认错误，并立即改正”的教导去做。去年十一月，兰考二中要成立革命委员会。这个学校的“八·一八”革命小将，冒着风雨，步行七十多里来到县革委会，要求批拨一点开会用的经费。县革委会主任张钦礼同志，当时感到这是全县第一个中等学校成立革命委员会，应当给予热情支持，就给他们批了些钱。但是，当其他常委认为这样做不符合毛主席“要节约闹革命”的教导后，他发现自己做错了，就马上在常委会上作了检讨，又向二中“八·一八”小将们检讨，还在其他会议上检讨。张钦礼同志就是这样严格地要求自己，以身作则，不折不扣地按照毛主席的指示办事。他常说：“忠于毛主席，有了成绩不翘尾巴；有了错误，开展批评和自我批评，坚决改，彻底改，迅速改。”他这样说了，也这样作了。
    兰考县革命委员会中的革命群众代表把自己的艰苦朴素作风，带到县革命委员会里来。县革命委员会委员阎协崇，是一位无限忠于毛主席，一贯艰苦奋斗的老贫农。为了支援越南人民的抗美救国战争，他教育儿女们，吃粗粮省细粮，多吃菜少吃粮，省出了二百斤小麦，留着支援越南人民。即使在县革委会成立前，在资产阶级反动路线的迫害下，他的老生儿子被折磨得皮包骨头，他也没有动那二百斤小麦。他说：“跟锄地一样，不能光锄自己脸前那一片，周围的草不锄掉，你那一片也干净不了。不解放全世界人民，不能算胜利，看不到全世界人民，权就掌不好。”这位老贫农，把掌好无产阶级政权同世界革命紧紧联系在一起，因而能够高度自觉地发扬艰苦奋斗的革命精神。他头上戴的那顶“火车头”棉帽，又小又破，已经二十五年了。可是今年一月，当老伴给他几元钱，叫他买顶新帽子时，他却坚持不买。他说：“这顶帽子虽说不好，可意义大。看见它就想起了旧社会的苦，就想起了今天的甜日子。”后来他又添了几元钱，买了五套《毛泽东选集》，留下一套自己学习，那四套分别送给了焦裕禄同志生前树立的四个红旗队。阎协崇这种无限忠于毛主席的深厚阶级感情和艰苦奋斗的革命精神，深深感动了革命委员会的全体同志们，他们都把阎协崇当成了学习的好榜样。
    艰苦奋斗成风　革命朝气蓬勃
    毛主席教导我们：“没有坚定正确的政治方向，就不能激发艰苦奋斗的工作作风；没有艰苦奋斗的工作作风，也就不能执行坚定正确的政治方向。”兰考县革命委员会的同志们认为：革命委员会能不能保持和发扬艰苦奋斗的工作作风，是无产阶级革命派能不能掌好权、用好权的大问题。因此，县革委会一成立，他们就遵循毛主席的教导，发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神，战胜了党内一小撮走资派大刮反革命经济主义妖风所造成的财政困难。去年二月份，这个县党内一小撮走资派，为了挽救他们失败的命运，大刮反革命经济主义妖风，任意挥霍国家财产，预计年底将出现大量赤字。
    面对这一严重问题，兰考县革委会认为，这是无产阶级革命派同党内一小撮走资派在经济领域里的阶级大搏斗。他们一方面发动广大群众，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在兰考的代理人所推行的“物质刺激”等修正主义黑货，彻底肃清反革命经济主义流毒；另一方面，想各种办法开源节流，扩大财政收入。他们坚决按照毛主席“财政的支出，应该根据节省的方针”的指示办事，坚持可以不用的钱，坚决不用，应该花的钱尽量少花，一切从生产出发，一切从节约出发。兰考县无产阶级革命派，在“二月逆流”中，曾经用大麻籽叶卷起来作笔，用锅底灰掺水当墨，写大字报，刷大标语。县革委会号召全县广大革命群众和干部学习和发扬这种艰苦奋斗的革命精神，尽力为国家节约一滴油，一粒米，一度电，一张纸。革委会本身也处处以身作则，带头节约闹革命。经过四个月的艰苦奋战，到年底，不仅弥补了财政赤字，还结余资金达六十一万三千元。
    兰考县革委会的同志们，象焦裕禄同志那样，心里装着全体人民，唯独没有他们自己。去冬，兰考县革委会各办公室、住室都没有生火取暖。不冷吗？隆冬天气，怎能不冷？常委值班室茶缸里的水都结了冰。照以往的习惯，早就该生火了。但他们考虑的不是自己冷不冷，而首先考虑的是群众生活得如何。有一天革委会办事组一位同志，给常委值班室生了个火，革委会一位负责同志发现后说：我们穿着厚厚的棉衣，再生个火取暖，烤热了皮肉，可就烤冷了心！常委会讨论了这个问题，一致同意不生火取暖。身教胜于言教。革委会的同志不生火取暖，带动了县直机关、公社也都不生火取暖了。这样，他们把原来批准给职工取暖用的五十吨煤，全部节省下来。
    有一天，县革委会一位负责同志要去郑州开会，当时离开车时间只有十几分钟了，办事组的同志要用小汽车送他，他坚决拒绝，背起背包，跑着赶车去了。这一点，看起来似乎是一件小事，但是在贫下中农心目中，却关系到你是当官做老爷还是做人民的勤务员的大问题。正象兰考县的贫下中农说的那样：“过去县里的走资派出门下乡都坐小汽车，象个官老爷，和俺们不是一个心眼；现在革委会的人，下乡自带行李，都是地下跑，和俺们一起学习，一起劳动，真和俺们的心贴得紧啊！”
    兰考县革委会的成员“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”，和群众滚在一起，踏踏实实做人民的“老黄牛”。县革委会委员赵新贞，是下放到秦寨大队的一个国家干部，群众称他是“拣不出来”的干部。意思是说，他皮肤黝黑，满手茧子，一身粗布衣着，站在农民群众中，谁也不能不把他当成一个地地道道的庄稼汉。贫下中农夸奖他说：“你看咱那老赵，说起来是县上的委员，可他没一点架子，和咱一块干活比原先还下劲，还吃苦！”赵新贞同志虽然患有慢性病，但是不管工作再劳累，睡的时间再晚，经常是天麻麻亮就起床，抓起扫帚，从街西头扫到街东头。革委会的同志们象焦裕禄同志那样，当群众最困难的时候，就出现在群众面前。每当大雪大风天气，下乡访贫问苦已成了他们的新习惯。
    密切联系群众　不断改造自己
    只有密切地联系群众，深刻地了解群众，才能带着深厚的无产阶级感情，发扬艰苦奋斗的作风，更好地为人民服务。正象毛主席所教导的那样：“我们任何时候都不要离开群众。这样，我们就可能知道群众，了解群众，同群众一道，也就可能好好地为人民服务。”
    兰考县革委会的同志深刻地体会到：脱离了群众，就是离开了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线；跟群众贴得越紧，对毛主席就越亲，按照毛泽东思想办事的自觉性就越高。他们以焦裕禄同志为榜样，千方百计地保持和加强同兰考县三十八万人民鱼水相依的密切联系。革命委员会内实行分工负责，轮流值班，亲自接待群众来访，处理群众来信，经常下乡、下厂，深入实际，深入群众。革委会中的革命群众代表，除常委有时轮流值班外，都不脱离原来的学习、生产和工作岗位。
    县革委会所在地，原是一座“文庙”，日本鬼子侵占期间，是日伪县政府；国民党反动派统治年代，是伪专员公署。人们叫那里是“老衙门”。如今，这里成了县革委会的所在地。但是有些人对这个大院存在的老看法却还没有改变过来。一天，有两位农民，牵着几只羊，在革委会门前走来走去，问这是啥地方，叫不叫进去看看。这事正好被革委会一位负责同志碰到了。他马上热情地说：“这是咱县革命委员会呀，叫看，来，我领你们进来看吧！”说着，就把这两位农民领进了革命委员会的大院。革委会的同志们从这件事情上得到了新的启示，又进一步采取措施：让农代会搬进革委会院内；在革委会院内设立了群众来访接待室。这样，革委会更成了贫下中农常来常往的地方，革委会也开了一条及时听取群众意见的渠道。
    把自己置于群众监督之下，善于接受群众批评，是兰考县革委会同志们破私立公、防止资产阶级思想侵袭、实现思想革命化的一个重要动力。有一位革命群众代表，被选为县革命委员会常委后，一时产生了怕苦、怕脏的思想，参加集体劳动生产不如以前扎实了。村里的贫下中农看在眼里，记在心上，就主动找着她，语重心长地说：“旧社会地主老财不把咱穷人当人看待，现在你当上了县里的委员，能代表咱贫下中农当家说话，这都是托毛主席他老人家的福啊！你可得好好领着咱贫下中农抓革命促生产啊！”贫下中农的中肯帮助，句句打动了她的心。她对照毛主席的教导，回忆了当上委员后的思想变化，不禁大吃一惊。她十分感慨地说：“地位再变，劳动人民的思想可万万不能变啊！”从此，她除参加必要的会议外，经常在队里参加集体劳动。还有一个革命群众的代表，当上委员后，一度沾染了讲阔气、闹排场的资产阶级思想。工人同志们为了帮助他去掉这种坏思想苗头，不少人主动地同他促膝谈心，向他进行阶级教育。有位姓黄的老工人和他一起忆苦思甜，当他回想到小时候同母亲逃荒要饭的悲惨情景时，热泪横流，他激动地对那位老工人说：“请你们放心啦，我永远不会忘本。”他自觉地脱下了毛呢衣服和皮鞋，换上了普通的劳动服装，同群众一起狠抓革命，猛促生产。
    毛主席教导我们：“干部通过参加集体生产劳动，同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系。这是社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事，它有助于克服官僚主义，防止修正主义和教条主义。”兰考县革委会遵照毛主席的这一伟大教导，把干部经常参加集体生产劳动作为一个不容侵犯的制度，作为反修防变，保持和发扬艰苦奋斗革命作风、实现思想革命化的一个大问题。革委会成立后，常委同志们第一次参加集体生产劳动，是在毛主席十五年前视察过的许贡庄。那里的贫下中农回忆起当时见到毛主席的动人情景，总是热泪盈眶，感激万分。毛主席亲自访问过的七十四岁的老贫农董宪德，对毛主席和他谈话时的激动人心的情景，至今记忆犹新。当常委同志们告诉他，毛主席身体非常非常健康的时候，董宪德老大爷无比兴奋地说：“毛主席身体健康，是咱全中国全世界人民的最大福气，祝愿他老人家万寿无疆！”贫下中农对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的深厚的阶级感情，深深地激励着在场的常委们，使他们受了一次生动深刻的忠于毛主席的阶级教育。
    革委会有不少委员主动带领所在地的干部、群众，以旺盛的革命热情，经常积极地参加集体生产劳动。县革委会委员、仪封公社吕拐大队革委会主任陶云彬提出“放下洋车子，扛起粪箩头”的口号，带头背起粪筐，扛起铁锹，经常同社员一道战斗在田间。三月上旬的一天，公社组织春耕生产大检查，他在人未到齐的一点空隙时间内，还要坚持在队里干活，分秒必争，一时一刻也不肯脱离集体生产劳动，经常同劳动人民滚在一起，在社会主义集体生产劳动的大熔炉里百炼成钢！
