Editor's Note: Xingguo County was a model county praised by the great leader Chairman Mao during the Second Civil War. The Revolutionary Committee of Xingguo County, born in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, follows Chairman Mao's teachings of "carrying forward the revolutionary tradition and striving for greater glory," leading the broad revolutionary masses to advance victoriously along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The revolutionary tradition of our Party and Army was personally advocated and cultivated by Chairman Mao, and it was established through the blood and sacrifice of countless revolutionary forerunners and arduous struggles. It is an important guarantee for us to defeat domestic and foreign class enemies, and it is an indispensable treasure for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and carrying the socialist revolution through to the end.

The revolutionary tradition, in a nutshell, is the tradition of implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. From the day of its establishment, the newly born Revolutionary Committee should take over and pass on the revolutionary tradition, making it their fundamental task to lead the masses to model the implementation of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

In October 1949, Chairman Mao, in a telegram to the Party, government, army, and people of Yan'an, expressed the hope: "All revolutionary cadres in the country should forever maintain the hardworking style that has been possessed by the cadres in Yan'an and the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region over the past decade or so."

Comrades in the Revolutionary Committees across the country should, with deep class feelings for Chairman Mao, seriously study Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice, and widely carry out education on revolutionary traditions. They should turn the Party and Army's revolutionary tradition, which vividly embodies Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, into their actual actions and use it as a powerful driving force for revolution and production.

The great teacher Chairman Mao's inscription for the people of the revolutionary base areas: "Carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory," is a beacon that illuminates our path forward. From the day of its establishment, the Revolutionary Committee of Xingguo County has regarded Chairman Mao's teachings as a revolutionary treasure, a weapon of struggle, and a driving force for progress. They have vigorously promoted education on revolutionary traditions and have always been loyal to the great teacher Chairman Mao.

Xingguo is a model county in the revolutionary base areas that Chairman Mao praised during the Second Civil War. The people of Xingguo, with a glorious revolutionary tradition, have forged a heart that is forever loyal to Chairman Mao through long-term revolutionary struggles and have cultivated and trained a large number of heroic Red Army soldiers loyal to Chairman Mao. Today, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has further aroused the class consciousness of the 380,000 people of Xingguo. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, they were the first in Jiangxi to establish a county-level Revolutionary Committee, achieving a decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, whether we can continue to "carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory" has become a touchstone to test whether we are loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. On the first day of the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, we held our first class, inviting revolutionary old comrades to recount Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice in Xingguo during those years and to introduce the glorious deeds of revolutionary forerunners who followed Chairman Mao's words and created first-class work. One of our main decisions was to propagate and study Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice, conduct education on revolutionary traditions, and fully mobilize the masses to collect and organize historical materials on Chairman Mao's revolutionary activities in Xingguo. We regard these historical materials as the most valuable living textbooks for traditional education.

To deepen traditional education, we organized the members of people's communes, factory workers, teachers and students, and revolutionary cadres in batches to visit Changgang Township (now Changgang Brigade of Changgang Commune), where Chairman Mao conducted investigations, to visit the "Mao Zedong's Changgang Township Investigation Exhibition Hall," to labor in the fields where Chairman Mao worked, and to listen to old comrades from Changgang Township introduce the good style of the revolutionary base area cadres who dedicated themselves wholeheartedly and completely to serving the people.

Carry forward the revolutionary good style advocated by Chairman Mao and vigorously run Mao Zedong Thought study classes

In the past, Chairman Mao's revolutionary good style of learning was best exemplified by the Land Revolution Cadres Training Class he held at Wenchang Temple in our county. Here, Chairman Mao personally trained tens of thousands of land revolution cadres. Wenchang Temple became the most lively classroom of Mao Zedong Thought. However, under the control of a small clique of capitalist roaders within the Party in Xingguo County, this lively classroom was long sealed off. Today, the revolutionary masses have seized power from the small clique of capitalist roaders within the Party and can fully utilize this lively classroom to inherit and carry forward the revolutionary good style of theoretical linkage with practice advocated by Chairman Mao. Following Chairman Mao's latest instruction that "holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes," the entire county has held various types of study classes, with 326,000 people participating in the study.

Recently, Jiaoxi Brigade of Yongfeng Commune held a study class on the construction site. The masses, armed with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, severely criticized the heinous crimes of the small clique of capitalist roaders within the Party. Through the study, the social awareness of the commune members was raised, and their revolutionary enthusiasm was doubled. They said, "If the people of Dazhai can do it, we can do it too." They responded to Chairman Mao's call to "learn from Dazhai in agriculture," with the spirit of the old fool, "determined to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory." They opened more than fifty acres of "Dazhai Mountain" and more than ten acres of "Dazhai Field" in one week. The newly opened "Dazhai Mountain" was all planted with tea trees. The people of Jiaoxi set a good example in putting Chairman Mao's instructions into practice and took the lead in creating new first-class work.

In our study classes, we use Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions and the "Three Articles" as our ideological weapons, with "criticizing revisionism and repudiating oneself" as the main line, and revolutionary forerunners and model heroes as mirrors. We focus on education on class struggle and line struggle, making the study of Mao Zedong Thought and revolutionary criticism closely linked, and theoretical education closely linked with practical education. We strengthen the consciousness of class struggle and line struggle, never forgetting proletarian dictatorship.

Strengthening the consciousness of class struggle and line struggle, never forgetting class struggle, and never forgetting proletarian dictatorship is the most fundamental stance and awareness of loyalty to Chairman Mao. Forgetting class struggle and proletarian dictatorship means forgetting the fundamental viewpoint of Mao Zedong Thought, which is disloyal to the great leader Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Socialism is a fairly long historical stage. In this historical stage of socialism, there still exist classes, class contradictions, and class struggle, there exist the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism, and there is the danger of capitalist restoration." "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the seizure of power and the consolidation of power."

After deeply studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and analyzing the situation of class struggle, everyone agreed that the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in the countryside ultimately boils down to the struggle between consolidating proletarian dictatorship and subverting proletarian dictatorship. Therefore, we, with Mao Zedong Thought as our guide, mobilized the masses to recall and compare, carry out three investigations (investigating the behind-the-scenes activities of capitalist roaders; investigating spies and traitors; investigating the sabotage activities of landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists), and focus our hatred on China's Khrushchev and his agents, and on landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of the proletariat, with their personal experiences and what they have heard and seen, listed the various manifestations of class struggle in Xingguo County under the new situation, such as: untransformed landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists inciting factional struggles, class revenge, counterattacks, resisting reform, corrupting cadres, restoring feudal superstitions, speculation, spreading rumors, advocating individual farming, etc. Through study and the three investigations, the broad masses' awareness of enemy situations and political consciousness were greatly enhanced.

The broad poor and lower-middle peasants used their own bitter history to severely criticize China's Khrushchev's theory of "extinguishing class struggle." They organized the masses to struggle against untransformed landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, making them lose their arrogance. At the same time, they guided everyone to recall the bitterness of the poor and lower-middle peasants in the old society and the sweetness of the poor and lower-middle peasants holding power in the new society. In this way, some comrades who had been affected and did not want to continue serving as cadres corrected their wrong thoughts, bravely stepped forward to shoulder the heavy responsibilities of revolution and production, and established and improved the leading cadres at all levels. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants severely criticized China's Khrushchev's "three freedoms and one contract" and "four freedoms" and other revisionist poison, opened their eyes, raised their awareness, consolidated and developed the socialist collective economy.

Following Chairman Mao's great instruction of "learning from Dazhai in agriculture," we have set up three banners in the county that are loyal to Chairman Mao and have done a good job of learning from Dazhai: Changgang Brigade of Changgang Commune, Jiaoxi Brigade of Yongfeng Commune, and Shangshe Supply and Marketing Cooperative. These are models of active learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, which have powerfully promoted the thought revolutionization of the people of the entire county and launched a mass movement of learning from and catching up with the advanced.

Changgang Brigade and Shangshe Supply and Marketing Cooperative are model units that Chairman Mao praised during the Second Civil War. After liberation, the people of Changgang held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carried forward the revolutionary tradition, and set a brilliant example for the people of the entire county. Shangshe Supply and Marketing Cooperative is also a red banner in the financial and trade front and among the broad revolutionary cadres of the entire county, with a heart of loyalty to Chairman Mao, completely and thoroughly serving the people. The people of Jiaoxi listen to Chairman Mao's words, follow the road of Dazhai, rely on their own efforts, and work hard to change production conditions, achieving continuous increases in production for six years, making Jiaoxi a Dazhai-style brigade in Xingguo.

However, for a long time, the red banners of Changgang Brigade, Shangshe Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and Jiaoxi Brigade have been envied by China's Khrushchev and his agents. The small clique of capitalist roaders within the Party has done everything possible to suppress Changgang Brigade, belittle Changgang Brigade, and attempt to cut down the red banner personally raised by Chairman Mao. After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, we, with boundless love and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, have raised the three red banners that are loyal to Chairman Mao: Changgang Brigade, Shangshe Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and Jiaoxi Brigade, making them good examples for the people of the entire county to learn from. To promote the socialist competition of learning from and catching up with the advanced, according to the requirements of the people of the entire county, we organized cadres above the production team to visit Changgang and Jiaoxi in batches to learn. We organized the broad masses of workers to visit Shangshe Supply and Marketing Cooperative to learn. Through visits and learning, they strengthened their determination to create new first-class work and promoted the thought revolutionization of the people of the entire county.

We must grasp the thought revolutionization of the members of the Revolutionary Committee and lead the entire county to be red.

"The good style of the cadres in the Soviet area, carrying their own food to work, wearing grass shoes to make revolution, walking on mountain roads with lanterns at night." The revolutionary spirit of the revolutionary forerunners of Xingguo, who completely and thoroughly served the people, has set a brilliant example for us.

Being loyal to Chairman Mao is the fundamental aspect of thought revolutionization. A revolutionary leading cadre must arm every member's mind with Mao Zedong Thought, keep a heart of loyalty, highlight the use of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, follow closely, act quickly, move at the wind, act decisively, and implement them thoroughly, making Chairman Mao's latest instructions quickly become the conscious actions of the broad masses.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "If our Party does not have a large number of new cadres cooperating with old cadres, our cause will be interrupted." After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, we paid attention to correctly handling the relationship between new and old cadres, the relationship between superiors and subordinates, and the relationship between cadres and the masses. In work, we achieved a combination of new and old, a combination of superiors and subordinates, and a combination of cadres and the masses, forever maintaining a fighting collective. Among the new and old cadres, we carried out one-to-one activities, with the old leading the new and the new and old combining, jointly learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and jointly criticizing revisionism and repudiating oneself. Whoever has any insights can speak freely; whoever has any shortcomings or mistakes can be pointed out and helped to solve responsibly. In the relationship between superiors and subordinates, we fully carried out democracy, widely solicited opinions, and played the role of collective leadership. Every decision made was widely solicited from the opinions of grassroots cadres and the masses, constantly modified, and constantly improved. In the relationship between cadres and the masses, we followed Chairman Mao's teaching of being both an "official" and a common person, forever being with the masses. Our members come from various aspects, and we carry forward the good style of the cadres of the old base areas of deeply entering the masses and the grassroots. Except for regular study and meetings, the committee members all return to their original classes, production teams, and classes to participate in production, work, and study. The standing committee members personally receive letters and visits, and insist on the Tuesday and Friday study system, which is convenient for listening to the opinions of the masses, accepting the supervision of the masses, and also convenient for urging oneself to achieve thought revolutionization.

Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Care for the People's Livelihood and Pay Attention to Work Methods" is the required textbook for the committee members. Recently, a fire occurred in Mubu Brigade of Longkou Commune. The brigade and commune cadres, as well as the PLA fighting on the "three supports, two militaries" front, immediately led the masses into the fire scene with a fearless spirit of not fearing hardship or death, helping the disaster-stricken poor and lower-middle peasants to rescue. After the Revolutionary Committee of the county received the disaster report, recalling Chairman Mao's praise: "In Changgang Township, a poor peasant had half a room burned down, and the township government mobilized the masses to donate money to help him." Immediately organized several hundred firefighters to rush to the scene and participate in the battle. The next day, the Revolutionary Committee organized a propaganda team of Mao Zedong Thought to donate precious books to the disaster-stricken poor and lower-middle peasants, help them hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and help them to produce and rescue themselves. The production and life of the disaster-stricken households were quickly arranged. Many poor and lower-middle peasants were moved to tears. They said: "The comrades of the Revolutionary Committee have inherited the glorious tradition and are the trusted friends of the poor and lower-middle peasants."

In the past three months, we have only done some of the work we should have done, and on the road to creating new first-class work, we have only taken the first step. The gap between us and Chairman Mao's requirements, and between us and the advanced units, is still far. We must "carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory," be humble and prudent, guard against arrogance and impatience, and determine to overcome all difficulties, like the revolutionary forerunners, and strive to create new "first-class work."

    发扬革命传统  争取更大光荣
    兴国县革命委员会
    编者按：兴国县，在第二次国内革命战争时期，是伟大领袖毛主席表彰过的，创造了第一等工作的模范县。在无产阶级文化大革命中诞生的兴国县革命委员会，遵循毛主席的“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的教导，正在带领广大革命群众沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利前进。
    我党我军的革命传统，是毛主席亲自倡导和培育的，是经过无数革命前辈流血牺牲、艰苦奋斗创立起来的。它是我们战胜国内外阶级敌人的重要保证，是巩固无产阶级专政、把社会主义革命进行到底所不可缺少的传家宝。
    革命传统，集中到一点，就是贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的传统。新生的革命委员会，从它成立的第一天起，就应当把革命传统接过来传下去，把领导广大群众模范地贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，作为自己的根本任务。
    一九四九年十月，毛主席在给延安党政军民的复电中，曾经殷切地希望：“全国一切革命工作人员，永远保持过去十余年间在延安和陕甘宁边区的工作人员中所具有的艰苦奋斗的作风。”
    各地革命委员会的同志，要怀着对毛主席的无限深厚的阶级感情，认真学习毛泽东思想和毛主席的伟大革命实践，广泛进行革命传统的教育，把生动体现毛主席革命路线的我党我军的革命传统，变为自己的实际行动，并成为推动革命和生产的强大动力。
    伟大的导师毛主席给革命老根据地人民的题词：“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”，是一盏光芒四射的指路明灯，照亮了我们前进的航程。兴国县革命委员会从成立的第一天起，就把毛主席的这一教导，当作革命的法宝，战斗的武器，前进的动力。大抓革命传统教育永远忠于伟大导师毛主席
    兴国是毛主席在第二次国内革命战争时期表彰过的革命老根据地的模范县。富有光荣革命传统的兴国儿女，在长期的革命斗争中，锤炼了一颗永远忠于毛主席的红心，培养和造就了大批忠于毛主席的英雄的红军战士。今天，无产阶级文化大革命运动，进一步激发了三十八万兴国人民的阶级觉悟，在毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，在江西第一个建立了县级革命委员会，取得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。
    革命委员会成立后，能不能继续“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”，成为检验我们是不是忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的试金石。革命委员会一成立，我们上的第一节课，就是请革命老同志讲述毛主席当年在兴国的伟大革命实践，介绍革命前辈听毛主席的话，创造第一等的工作的光辉事迹。我们作出的主要决定之一，就是宣传、学习毛主席的伟大革命实践，进行革命传统教育，充分发动群众搜集、整理毛主席在兴国革命活动的历史资料。我们把这些革命史料作为传统教育最宝贵的活教材。
    为了加深传统教育，我们分期分批地组织人民公社社员、厂矿职工、教师和学生、革命干部到毛主席当年作过调查的长冈乡（现在的长冈公社长冈大队），参观“毛泽东同志长冈乡调查陈列馆”，到毛主席劳动过的田里劳动，请长冈乡老同志介绍老根据地工作人员一心为公，“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的好作风。发扬毛主席亲自倡导的革命好学风大力办好毛泽东思想学习班
    当年，毛主席在我县文昌宫主办的土地革命干部训练班，是毛主席倡导的革命好学风的最光辉典范。在这里，毛主席亲自培养了成千上万的土地革命干部。文昌宫成为最活的毛泽东思想的大课堂。可是，过去在兴国县党内一小撮走资派的控制下，这个活课堂长期被封锁。今天，无产阶级革命派夺了党内一小撮走资派的权，就能充分利用这个活课堂，继承和发扬毛主席亲自倡导的理论联系实际的革命好学风。遵照毛主席“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的最新指示，全县办了各种类型的学习班，有三十二万六千人次参加了学习。
    永丰公社焦溪大队，最近开办了一期工地学习班。广大社员以毛主席最新指示为武器，痛批党内一小撮走资派的滔天罪行。通过学习，提高了社员社会主义觉悟，革命干劲倍增。他们说，大寨人能做到的，我们也能做到。他们响应毛主席提出的“农业学大寨”的号召，用老愚公的精神，“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”一鼓作气地开山凿石，一星期内开了五十多亩“大寨山”，十多亩“大寨田”。新开的“大寨山”全部种上了茶树。焦溪人民在“用”字上做出了好榜样，在创造新的第一等工作中带了头。
    我们办学习班，以毛主席一系列最新指示和“老三篇”为思想武器，以“斗私，批修”为纲，以革命前辈和英雄模范为镜子，狠抓阶级斗争和路线斗争教育，革命传统教育，使学习毛泽东思想和革命大批判紧密联系，理论教育和实际教育紧密联系。加强阶级斗争和路线斗争观念，念念不忘无产阶级专政
    加强阶级斗争和路线斗争观念，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，是忠于毛主席最根本的立场，最根本的觉悟。忘了阶级斗争，忘了无产阶级专政就忘了毛泽东思想的根本观点，就是对伟大领袖毛主席不忠。
    毛主席教导我们：“社会主义社会是一个相当长的历史阶段。在社会主义这个历史阶段中，还存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，存在着社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争，存在着资本主义复辟的危险性。”“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”
    在深入地学习了毛主席的最新指示，分析了阶级斗争形势以后，大家认为，农村中两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，归根结底就是巩固无产阶级专政与颠覆无产阶级专政的斗争。因此，我们以毛泽东思想为指针，放手发动群众，大搞回忆对比，开展三查（查走资派的幕后活动；查特务、叛徒；查地富反坏右的破坏活动），把千仇万恨集中在中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人身上，集中在地富反坏右的身上。广大贫下中农和无产阶级革命派，以自己的亲身经历和耳闻目睹的事实，列举了在新形势下，兴国县阶级斗争的种种表现，如：没有改造好的地富反坏右挑动宗派斗争、阶级报复、反攻倒算、抗拒改造、拉拢腐蚀干部、恢复封建迷信、投机倒把、造谣惑众、鼓动单干等等。通过学习和三查活动，大大提高了广大群众的敌情观念和政治觉悟。
    广大贫下中农用自己的血泪史，痛批中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论。对没有改造好的地富反坏右，组织群众斗争，使他们威风扫地。同时，引导大家忆旧社会贫下中农无权的苦，比新社会贫下中农掌权的甜。这样，原来受了些冲击，不想继续当干部的一些同志，纠正了自己的错误思想，勇敢地站出来挑起革命和生产的重担，并且建立和健全了各级领导班子。广大贫下中农狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“三自一包”、“四大自由”等修正主义流毒，擦亮了眼睛，提高了觉悟，巩固和发展了社会主义集体经济。抓典型，树旗帜，开展比学赶帮的社会主义竞赛
    我们遵照毛主席“农业学大寨”的伟大指示，在全县树起了忠于毛主席，学大寨较好的长冈公社长冈大队、永丰公社焦溪大队和上社供销社三面活学活用毛泽东思想的先进旗帜，有力地促进了全县人民的思想革命化，展开了群众性的比学赶帮的社会主义竞赛。
    长冈大队和上社供销社都是毛主席在第二次国内革命战争时期表扬过的模范单位。解放后，长冈人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬革命传统，为全县人民做出了光辉的榜样。上社供销社也是一片丹心忠于毛主席，“完全”“彻底”为人民服务，不仅是财贸战线上而且是全县广大革命职工中的一面先进红旗。焦溪人民听毛主席的话，走大寨之路，自力更生、艰苦奋斗，改变了生产条件，连续六年大增产，是兴国的大寨式大队。
    可是，长期以来，长冈大队、上社供销社和焦溪大队这样的红旗，却遭到了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人的仇视。党内一小撮走资派千方百计地打击长冈大队，贬低长冈大队，妄图砍掉毛主席亲自树起的这面红旗。革命委员会成立后，我们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚的心情，把无限忠于毛主席的长冈大队、上社供销社和焦溪大队三面红旗，树了起来，成为全县人民学习的好榜样。为了促进学先进、赶先进的社会主义竞赛，根据全县人民的要求，我们组织生产队以上的干部分期分批到长冈、焦溪参观学习。组织广大职工去上社供销社参观学习。通过参观学习，增强了他们创造新的第一等工作的决心，推动了全县人民的思想革命化。
    狠抓革命委员会成员的思想革命化，带动全县一片红
      “苏区干部好作风，自带干粮去办公，日着草鞋干革命，夜走山路打灯笼”。兴国革命前辈那种“完全”
  “彻底”为人民服务的革命精神，给我们做出了光辉榜样。
    无限忠于毛主席，是思想革命化的根本。一个革命化的领导班子，必须用毛泽东思想武装每个成员的头脑，心怀一个“忠”字，突出一个“用”字，跟得紧，行动快，闻风而动，雷厉风行，坚决照办，一杆子插到底，使毛主席的最新指示迅速成为广大群众的自觉行动。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们党如果没有广大的新干部同老干部一致合作，我们的事业就会中断。”革命委员会成立之后，我们注意了正确处理新老干部关系、上下级关系、干部和群众的关系。在工作上做到新老结合，上下结合，干群结合，永远保持一个战斗的集体。在新老干部之间，我们开展一帮一的活动，以老带新，新老结合，共同活学活用毛泽东思想，共同斗私批修。谁有什么心得体会都能畅所欲言的交谈；谁有什么缺点错误都能认真负责的指出和帮助解决。在上下级关系上，我们充分发扬民主，广泛征求意见，发挥集体领导的作用。每作出一个决定，都广泛地征求基层干部和人民群众的意见，不断修改，不断完善。在干群关系上，我们遵照毛主席既当“官”，又当老百姓的教导，永远和人民群众在一起。我们的成员都是来自各个方面，我们发扬老根据地干部深入群众，深入基层的好作风。除定期的学习、会议聚拢在一起外，委员都回原来的班组、生产队和班级参加生产、工作和学习。常委们亲自接待来信来访，并且坚持每周二、五学习制度，既便于倾听群众的意见，接受群众的监督，又便于鞭策自己，实现思想革命化。
    毛主席的光辉著作《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》，是委员们的必读课本。不久前，龙口公社睦埠大队发生过一场火灾。大队和公社干部以及战斗在“三支”、“两军”前线的解放军发现后，立即带领群众，奔进火场，以不怕苦、不怕死的大无畏精神，帮助受灾贫下中农抢救。县革命委员会得到灾情报告后，想起毛主席的表扬：“长冈乡有一个贫苦农民被火烧掉了一间半房子，乡政府就发动群众捐钱帮助他。”立即组织几百人的救火大军，赶到现场，参加战斗。第二天，革命委员会又组织一支毛泽东思想宣传队向受灾的贫下中农赠送宝书，帮助他们办毛泽东思想学习班，帮助他们生产自救，受灾户的生产、生活很快就得到了安排。很多贫下中农感动得流下了眼泪。他们说：“革命委员会的同志继承光荣传统，是贫下中农的贴心人。”
    三个月来，我们只做了我们应该做的一些工作，在创造新的第一等工作的大道上，只迈开了第一步，离毛主席的要求，跟先进单位比较，差距还很远。我们一定“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”，谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，下定决心，排除万难，象革命前辈那样，为创造新的“第一等的工作”而奋斗。
