On February 29th, the Patriotic Armed Forces launched a fierce attack on the enemy in Dakay, capturing six enemy soldiers, including one captain and two lieutenants.

On the same day, the Patriotic Armed Forces ambushed an enemy convoy, killing 23 enemies and destroying two trucks.

From March 8th to 13th, the Patriotic Armed Forces fought near Saravane Town and the Leushan County City, killing and wounding 50 enemies.

On March 1st, 12th, and 13th, the Patriotic Armed Forces used artillery to bombard the headquarters of the enemy's 802nd Battalion, killing and wounding a large number of enemies, destroying many warehouses, vehicles, and fortifications. On March 13th alone, they killed and wounded over 30 enemies.

Under the heavy blows of the Patriotic Armed Forces, the enemy was forced to abandon eight outposts around Leushan on March 3rd. Additionally, 58 enemy soldiers surrendered to the people.

According to another report, from February 23rd to March 10th, the Patriotic Armed Forces of Xaisomboun Province fought in the Kangkhan and Thakhengdet areas, killing nearly 500 enemies.
