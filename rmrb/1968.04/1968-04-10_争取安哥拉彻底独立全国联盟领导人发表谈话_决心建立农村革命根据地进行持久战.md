The leader of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola recently spoke to a Xinhua News Agency reporter in Cairo. He said, "The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the truth of revolution. Mao Zedong Thought is the only correct revolutionary theory guiding the victory of national liberation movements. Whoever accepts the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought will achieve the victory of self-liberation." The leader continued, "As long as we follow the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, unite the broad masses of patriotic people, rely on our own strength, and persist in long-term armed struggle, the people of Angola will surely achieve our goal—complete independence and liberation."

Regarding the current situation of the armed struggle of the people of Angola, the leader said, "Our experience over the past few years has shown that without establishing a revolutionary base within the country and mobilizing and relying on the broad masses, we cannot achieve our goal—the liberation of Angola. Following the invincible thoughts of the great leader Chairman Mao, since 1966, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola has been determined to follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao, establish rural revolutionary bases, mobilize and organize the masses, and wage a protracted people's war to achieve the final victory of the struggle."

He said, "Now, in the vast areas of eastern and southeastern Angola, the guerrillas are very active. They use Chairman Mao's famous sixteen-character strategy for guerrilla warfare, ambush the Portuguese colonial troops, attack enemy strongholds, and cut off their communication lines, making the enemy panic-stricken and disorganized."

The leader continued, "The guerrillas led by the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola have adopted Chairman Mao's famous 'Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention' and strictly follow them in action. The guerrillas also go deep into the masses, establishing close ties with them. Now, the rural revolutionary bases in Angola are in the process of being established and consolidated."

He emphasized, "We know that there are still many difficulties ahead on our path forward, and we still have a long way to go before achieving the final victory of the struggle. However, we are fully confident that as long as we follow Chairman Mao's teachings, apply these teachings according to the specific conditions of Angola, and firmly rely on the broad masses, we will surely achieve victory."

	Angolan patriotic armed forces' guerrilla fighters persist in guerrilla warfare in the mountains, bravely and intelligently striking back at the Portuguese colonialists supported by American imperialism.

    争取安哥拉彻底独立全国联盟领导人发表谈话
    决心建立农村革命根据地进行持久战
    据新华社开罗电　争取安哥拉彻底独立全国联盟领导人最近在开罗对新华社记者发表谈话说：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想是革命的真理。毛泽东思想是指导民族解放运动取得胜利的唯一正确的革命理论。谁接受毛泽东思想的指导，谁就能赢得自身解放的胜利。”这位领导人接着说：“只要我们以毛泽东思想为指导，团结广大的爱国群众，依靠我们自己的力量，坚持长期武装斗争，我们安哥拉人民就必将达到我们的目标——彻底的独立和解放。”
    在谈到安哥拉人民武装斗争当前的形势时，这位领导人说，我们过去几年斗争的经验教训表明，不在国内建立革命根据地，不动员和依靠广大群众，我们就不可能达到我们的目标——安哥拉的解放。争取安哥拉彻底独立全国联盟根据伟大领袖毛主席的战无不胜的思想的教导，从一九六六年以来就决心遵循毛主席所指出的道路，建立农村革命根据地，动员和组织人民群众，进行持久的人民战争，以便取得斗争的最后胜利。
    他说，现在，在安哥拉东部和东南部的广大地区，游击队非常活跃。他们运用毛主席关于游击战的十六字诀，伏击葡萄牙殖民军，袭击敌人据点，割断他们的通讯联络线，使敌人惊恐万状、狼狈不堪。
    这位领导人接着说，争取安哥拉彻底独立全国联盟领导的游击队采用了毛主席制订的著名的“三大纪律八项注意”，并在行动中遵照执行。游击队还深入到群众中去，同群众建立了密切的联系。现在，安哥拉的农村革命根据地正处在建立和巩固过程中。
    他强调指出：“我们知道，在前进道路上，我们还有许许多多困难，我们还要经过一段漫长的道路，才能取得斗争的最后胜利。但是，我们完全相信，只要我们遵循毛主席的教导，根据安哥拉的具体条件运用这些教导，坚决依靠广大群众，我们必定取得胜利。”（附图片）
