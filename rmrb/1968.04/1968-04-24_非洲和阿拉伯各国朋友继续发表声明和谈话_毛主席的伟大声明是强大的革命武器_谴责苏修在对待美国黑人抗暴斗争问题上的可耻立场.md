African and Arab friends have continued to issue statements and speeches, enthusiastically hailing the great historical document, Chairman Mao's declaration supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence. They have also condemned the shameful stance taken by the Soviet modern revisionists on the issue of American blacks' struggle against violence.

New China News Agency, April 23rd: In recent days, African and Arab friends have continued to issue statements and speeches, enthusiastically hailing Chairman Mao's declaration supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence as a great historical document, and condemning the shameful stance taken by Soviet modern revisionists on the issue of American blacks' struggle against violence.

Sekjak, a representative of the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania (South Africa) in Cairo, said to a reporter from New China News Agency on the 20th in Cairo, "Chairman Mao's declaration once again shows that Chairman Mao is the great teacher of the revolutionary people of the world, the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time."

Sekjak said, "The Soviet modern revisionists do not dare to speak out against the brutal suppression of the struggle of American blacks against violence by the imperialist United States. At this time, the world hears Chairman Mao's call for the oppressed peoples to take action against American imperialism. He said, 'Chairman Mao's declaration is a powerful revolutionary weapon. This declaration has been supported by tens of millions of people fighting around the world.'"

He said, "The surging revolutionary storm has swept across the United States. The current struggle of American blacks against violence is a heavy blow to the ruling class of American imperialism and a brilliant contribution to the international proletariat's struggle against their common enemy, international imperialism and old and new colonialism."

Sekjak finally shouted, "Long live the revolutionary spirit! Long live the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, Chairman Mao!"

Ekwalla Robert, a friend from Cameroon, said in Conakry to a reporter from New China News Agency, "Chairman Mao's declaration points out the correct direction for the revolutionary movement in the United States and is a great support and invaluable strategic guidance for the peoples of various countries who are fighting. He pointed out that in the situation where modern revisionists are compromising with imperialists, Chairman Mao's declaration once again shows that Chairman Mao is the great teacher of the world revolutionary movement.

He said, "Chairman Mao's declaration is like a torch, illuminating the path forward for American blacks and the peoples of various countries in the world. Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's declaration, the people of the world will forever remember the teaching of 'political power grows out of the barrel of a gun,' and the flames of armed struggle will spread throughout the world."

He finally said, "The thought of our great teacher and helmsman, Chairman Mao Zedong, will forever shine brightly! I wish Chairman Mao a long life!"

Bobby Mark, a representative of the Botswana People's Party in Cairo, said to a reporter from New China News Agency on the 22nd, "This historically significant declaration by Chairman Mao will certainly inspire and encourage American blacks and the working class, as well as all oppressed peoples of the world, to carry the revolutionary struggle against American imperialism to the end."

He said, "Chairman Mao's declaration is a clarion call, urging the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world who are fighting to strengthen their struggle against American imperialism."

He also said, "Chairman Mao pointed out in the declaration: 'Only by overthrowing the reactionary rule of the American monopolistic bourgeoisie and destroying the system of colonialism and imperialism can American blacks achieve thorough liberation.' This revolutionary teaching will be a great encouragement not only to American blacks but also to the peoples of the world who are fighting against imperialism."

After reading Chairman Mao's declaration, Sudanese friends were extremely joyful and inspired. A Sudanese friend named Ahmed said in Khartoum, "American imperialism and its accomplice, Soviet modern revisionism, are closely collaborating. Soviet modern revisionists are very afraid of the victory of the revolutionary people and are doing everything they can to deceive the revolutionary people."

He said, "The political crisis that has occurred in the heart of international imperialism has dealt a heavy blow to the imperialist system. We can say that the complete collapse of imperialism and all exploitative systems is not far off."

Ahmed finally shouted, "Long live Mao Zedong Thought, the contemporary Marxism-Leninism!"

Another Sudanese friend named Omar Muhammad said, "The declaration by the great leader of the world revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence, proves that the People's Republic of China led by Chairman Mao is firmly supporting the peoples of all just struggles in the world. He went on to say that especially after the revisionists betrayed the people, the People's Republic of China has become the strongest supporter of the world revolution."

A senior official of the Arab Republic of Yemen said to a Chinese friend in Sana'a, "I firmly support Chairman Mao's declaration." He said, "Chairman Mao's teachings on armed struggle and 'political power grows out of the barrel of a gun' are universally applicable in China and all other countries. We must hold our guns firmly and defeat all the conspiracies of American imperialism. The path of armed struggle is the only correct path, which has been proven by the struggles of the Chinese people, the Vietnamese people, and the Yemeni people, and will be proven by the struggles of the American people and American blacks. He pointed out that waging a people's war is the only way to win independence and defend independence. As long as the peoples of the world, including the American people, unite, American imperialism will definitely be destroyed. Chairman Mao's declaration has given us new confidence and strength to persist in the armed struggle against American imperialism and the Saudi reactionaries."

    非洲和阿拉伯各国朋友继续发表声明和谈话
    毛主席的伟大声明是强大的革命武器
    谴责苏修在对待美国黑人抗暴斗争问题上的可耻立场
    新华社二十三日讯  非洲和阿拉伯各国朋友近日来继续发表声明和谈话，热烈欢呼毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明这一伟大历史文件的发表，并谴责苏联现代修正主义者在对待美国黑人斗争问题上所采取的可耻立场。
    阿扎尼亚（南非）泛非主义者大会驻开罗代表塞贾克二十日在开罗对新华社记者说，毛主席的声明再一次表明，毛主席是世界革命人民的伟大导师，是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。
    塞贾克说，苏联现代修正主义者对暴虐成性的美帝国主义镇压美国黑人抗暴斗争不敢作声。正在这个时候，全世界都听到了毛主席号召被压迫人民行动起来反对美帝国主义的声音。他说：“毛主席的声明是强大的革命武器，这一声明得到了全世界斗争中的千百万群众的支持。”
    他说：“风起云涌的革命风暴已席卷美国本土，美国黑人目前的抗暴斗争是对美帝国主义统治集团的沉重打击，是对国际无产阶级反对他们的共同敌人国际帝国主义和新老殖民主义斗争的光辉贡献。”
    塞贾克最后高呼：“革命精神万岁！”“当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛主席万岁！”
    喀麦隆朋友埃克瓦拉·罗贝尔在科纳克里对新华社记者说，毛主席的声明对美国的革命运动指出了正确的方向，对于正在斗争中的各国人民来说，是巨大的支持，是无法估量的战略指导。
    他指出，在现代修正主义者向帝国主义者妥协的情况下，毛主席的声明再一次表明了毛主席是世界革命运动的伟大导师。
    他说，毛主席的声明象一把火炬，照亮了美国黑人和世界各国人民前进的道路。全世界人民在毛主席的声明的光辉照耀下，将永远记住“枪杆子里面出政权”的教导，武装斗争的烈火将遍及全世界。
    他最后说：“我们的伟大导师、伟大舵手毛泽东主席的思想将永远光芒万丈！敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！”
    贝专纳人民党驻开罗代表波比·马克二十二日对新华社记者说，毛主席的“这个具有历史意义的声明，一定会激励和鼓舞美国的黑人和工人阶级以及全世界一切被压迫人民，把反对美帝国主义的革命斗争进行到底。”
    他说，毛主席的声明是嘹亮的号角，号召亚非拉和全世界一切斗争中的人民加强他们反对美帝国主义的斗争。
    他还说：“毛主席在声明里指出：‘只有推翻美国垄断资产阶级的反动统治，摧毁殖民主义、帝国主义制度，美国黑人才能够取得彻底解放。’这一革命的教导，不仅对美国黑人，而且对正在进行反帝斗争的世界人民都将是巨大的鼓舞。”
    苏丹朋友们读了毛主席的声明后，无限欢欣鼓舞。一位名叫艾哈迈德的苏丹朋友在喀土穆说，美帝国主义及其帮凶苏联现代修正主义正在加紧勾结。苏联现代修正主义者十分害怕革命人民的胜利，正在千方百计地蒙骗革命人民。
    他说：“在国际帝国主义的心脏发生的政治危机，给了帝国主义制度以沉重的打击，我们可以说，帝国主义和一切剥削制度的彻底崩溃已经为期不远了。”
    艾哈迈德最后高呼：“当代的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想万岁！”
    另一位叫奥梅尔·穆罕默德的苏丹朋友说，世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明的发表，证明了毛主席所领导的中华人民共和国是坚决支持全世界一切正义斗争中的人民的。他接着说，特别是在修正主义者背叛人民以后，中华人民共和国成了世界革命的最坚强的支持者。
    阿拉伯也门共和国一位高级官员在萨那对中国朋友说，他坚决支持毛主席的声明。他说，毛主席关于武装斗争和“枪杆子里面出政权”的教导，在中国和所有其他国家，都是普遍适用的。他说，我们必须紧握手中枪，击败美帝国主义的种种阴谋。武装斗争的道路是唯一正确的道路，它已被中国人民、越南人民和也门人民的斗争所证实，并将被美国人民和美国黑人的斗争所证实。他指出，开展人民战争是赢得独立和保卫独立的唯一道路。只要包括美国人民在内的全世界人民联合起来，美帝国主义是一定会消灭的。毛主席的声明使我们对坚持反对美帝国主义和沙特反动派的武装斗争增加了新的信心和力量。
