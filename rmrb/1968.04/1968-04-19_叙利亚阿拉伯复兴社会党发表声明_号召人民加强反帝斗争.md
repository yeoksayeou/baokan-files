The Syrian Arab Ba'ath Party's national leadership issued a statement on Syria's Independence Day (April 17), calling on the Syrian people to intensify their struggle against imperialism and Zionism and to defend national independence.

The statement said that on this day of independence, "our people and the Arab nations are more determined than ever to continue the struggle, resist the plots of imperialism and Zionism, and foil their schemes. We call on the progressive forces of the Arab world to resolutely shoulder this historical mission, lead the Arab people in armed struggle, end all forms of imperialist control over Arab lands, and achieve the fundamental goal of independence."

The statement pointed out, "our people, through countless sacrifices and heroic struggles, have been able to smash all imperialist plots."

The statement said that the plots of imperialism and Zionism to crush the Arab people's resolve to continue the struggle have not succeeded. The Arab people have bravely resisted their aggression and fought against all attempts at a "peaceful" solution to the Middle East problem and the imposition of threats, and are advancing on the path to victory.

    号召人民加强反帝斗争
    据新华社大马士革十七日电　叙利亚阿拉伯复兴社会党全国领导机构在叙利亚独立日（四月十七日）发表声明，号召叙利亚人民加强对帝国主义和犹太复国主义的斗争，捍卫国家独立。
    声明说，在纪念独立的时候，“我国人民群众和阿拉伯国家更有决心坚持斗争，对抗帝国主义和犹太复国主义的阴谋，并挫败他们的诡计。我们呼吁阿拉伯进步力量坚定地肩负起这一历史任务，领导阿拉伯人民进行武装斗争，结束帝国主义对阿拉伯国土的各种控制，实现独立的根本目的。”
    声明指出，“我们的人民通过无数的牺牲和英勇斗争，能够摧毁一切帝国主义的阴谋。”
    声明说，帝国主义和犹太复国主义企图扼杀阿拉伯人民坚持斗争的决心的阴谋并未得逞。阿拉伯人民英勇地抵御了它们的侵略，并同一切企图“和平”解决（中东问题）和施加威胁的手段进行斗争，而正在保证胜利的道路上前进。
