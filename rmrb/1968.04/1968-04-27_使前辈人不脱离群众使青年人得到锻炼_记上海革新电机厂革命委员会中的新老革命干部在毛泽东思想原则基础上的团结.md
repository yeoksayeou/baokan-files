A Cohesive Leadership Team

The new and old revolutionary cadres in the Shanghai Reform Electric Machinery Factory Revolutionary Committee respect, learn from, help, and support each other. They strive to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, ensuring that veterans do not lose touch with the masses and that the youth gain experience. United on the principles of Mao Zedong Thought, the new and old cadres form a cohesive team, establishing a new revolutionary style and creating a lively and dynamic work environment. They have become a vigorous and strong fighting collective.

The factory's Revolutionary Committee has a distinctive feature: the thoughts and actions of the new and old cadres are in harmony. Since its establishment, the committee has consistently adhered to studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle for all work. Whenever Chairman Mao issues new directives, they study them diligently and deeply understand them. When there are differences in opinion among the new and old cadres, they hold study sessions to resolve them using Mao Zedong Thought. Important issues are discussed and resolved collectively by the Revolutionary Committee.

At one point, a portion of the workers in the factory were influenced by anarchist tendencies, leading to lax discipline. During a discussion on this issue, some comrades suggested punishing a few individuals. Others disagreed, advocating for education to raise the workers' political consciousness. After studying Chairman Mao's teachings on guiding petty-bourgeois ideology towards the revolutionary path of the proletariat, they understood that the shortcomings or errors within the revolutionary masses could be overcome and corrected through appropriate political and ideological work. Thus, they unified their understanding and actions, effectively overcoming the influence of anarchist tendencies.

The new and old revolutionary cadres remember Chairman Mao's teachings on party criticism being a weapon to strengthen the party's organization and increase its combat effectiveness. They care for and help each other politically. Whether it is old or new cadres, if they see flaws in others, they point them out and help correct them without hesitation. Therefore, within the Revolutionary Committee, the atmosphere of criticism and self-criticism is very strong.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "If this 'team' does not act in unison, it will be impossible to lead thousands and tens of thousands of people into battle or to build." The "team" of this factory's Revolutionary Committee, by constantly using Mao Zedong Thought to resolve differences, strengthen unity, and unify thoughts and actions, can lead the masses to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments and achieve continuous victories. In the nearly half-year since its establishment, the Revolutionary Committee has held over a hundred sessions of various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes; the revolutionary criticism and denunciation campaign has been deepening; the Revolutionary Committee has led the broad revolutionary masses to proactively attack the class enemies, exposing a handful of bad elements that had infiltrated the revolutionary ranks, and strongly combating the class enemies' attempts to reverse verdicts. In the struggle against the enemy, the Revolutionary Committee has established its revolutionary authority. The revolution has driven production, and this year, the factory's production has been rising month by month.

To Hold Power and Use Power for the Proletariat

The new and old revolutionary cadres of the Revolutionary Committee act in unison and maintain consistent steps because they share a common ideological foundation: to hold and use power for the proletariat. When the Revolutionary Committee was first established, there were still some ideological barriers between the new and old cadres. To address this, they decided to hold a study session, using Mao Zedong Thought to break down selfishness and establish public-mindedness, solving the relationship issues between the new and old cadres.

This study session included over a hundred people from the factory's departments and workshops, as well as leaders from the Revolutionary Committee and rebel factions. They studied Chairman Mao's important instructions during his inspections of North China, Central South, and East China, the "Hunan Peasant Movement Survey Report," and the "Three Articles," with leaders taking the lead in criticizing and rectifying their own thoughts. Through the study, the ideological consciousness of the new and old cadres was significantly raised, uniting their hearts into one. They saw each other's strengths and developed a strong desire and demand to learn from each other. Some old cadres previously found it unpleasant to see new cadres vigorously debating during work discussions. Later, they discovered that the debates allowed everyone to fully express their opinions, making the work plans more thorough and avoiding one-sidedness. Thus, they also actively participated in the debates without hesitation. Some old cadres used to stay in their offices, relying on reports to understand the situation below, severely disconnecting from the masses. Now, they learn from the new cadres' style of closely connecting with the masses, frequently visiting the workshops to talk with workers, and during factory holidays or festivals, visiting workers' homes with new cadres. When facing major issues, they also consult with the workers. Many new cadres have learned from the old cadres' work experience and methods, raising their policy level and organizational capabilities, and also learning to do political and ideological work. Two forces tightly united into one

Because they saw each other's strengths, the new and old revolutionary cadres further understood the great superiority of the revolutionary "three-in-one" leadership team. Their revolutionary feelings for each other deepened, and they helped and supported each other in their work, uniting and cooperating closely.

At one point, a handful of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in the factory used the criticism of the capitalist reactionary line as a pretext to seek "rehabilitation" and threatened the old cadres. At this time, the new cadres firmly supported the old cadres in standing up and engaging in a resolute struggle against the handful of class enemies attempting to reverse verdicts, promptly stopping the evil wind and repelling the class enemies' arrogant attacks.

An old cadre responsible for leading production was accustomed to focusing solely on business matters, busy every day, but production was still not going well. Revolutionary Committee member and new cadre Tao Yonggen learned that the welding head group in the second workshop, through studying Chairman Mao's works, had unprecedented revolutionary enthusiasm. Despite heavy tasks and tight manpower, they found every possible way to complete the tasks ahead of schedule and displayed a spirit of cooperation, helping brother groups complete their tasks. After discovering this advanced seedling, he immediately discussed with the old cadre in charge of production, suggesting that he hold an on-site meeting to commend the group's advanced thinking. Once the meeting was held, the workers immediately launched a wave of emulation and learning, universally improving production. This incident greatly educated the old cadre, making him understand that political work must guide production.

Old cadres regard cultivating new cadres as their revolutionary responsibility, wholeheartedly helping them grow. When new cadres have flaws, old cadres use their past experiences of making mistakes to help new cadres improve their thinking and correct their flaws.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To fulfill its leadership duties, the Party committee must rely on this 'team,' fully bringing into play their roles." New and old revolutionary cadres helping and supporting each other have thus better played their roles in the revolutionary "three-in-one" power structure, strengthening the Revolutionary Committee's combat effectiveness.

    使前辈人不脱离群众使青年人得到锻炼
    ——记上海革新电机厂革命委员会中的新老革命干部在毛泽东思想原则基础上的团结
    一个动作整齐的领导班子
    上海革新电机厂革命委员会中的新老革命干部，互相尊重，互相学习，互相帮助，互相支持，努力做到毛主席所教导的那样，使前辈人不脱离群众，使青年人得到锻炼。新老革命干部在毛泽东思想的原则基础上，团结一致，拧成一股绳，使革委会树立了崭新的革命作风，创造了生动活泼的工作局面，成为一个朝气蓬勃的坚强的战斗集体。
    这个工厂的革委会，有个鲜明的特点，就是新老干部思想一致，行动一致。革委会成立以后，他们始终坚持活学活用毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想作为一切工作的指导方针。每当毛主席发出最新指示，他们就认真学习，深刻领会。新老干部思想上有分歧，就举办学习班，用毛泽东思想消除分歧。遇到重要问题，都由革委会集体讨论解决。
    有一个时期，厂里有一部分职工受无政府主义思潮的影响，纪律比较松懈。革委会在讨论这个问题的时候，有的同志主张处分几个人。有的同志不同意这种作法，认为要从教育着手，帮助群众提高思想觉悟。后来，大家学习了毛主席“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道”的教导，懂得了革命群众中的缺点或错误，是能够经过适当的政治思想工作使他们克服和改正的。于是，统一了认识，统一了行动，较好地克服了无政府主义思潮的影响。
    新老革命干部牢记毛主席“党内批评是坚强党的组织、增加党的战斗力的武器”的教导，在政治上互相关心，互相帮助。无论是老干部还是新干部，看到对方有缺点，都能毫无顾虑地及时指出，帮助改正。因此，在革委会内部，批评和自我批评的空气很浓厚。
    毛主席教导我们说：“如果这‘一班人’动作不整齐，就休想带领千百万人去作战，去建设。”这个工厂革委会的“一班人”，由于经常注意用毛泽东思想消除分歧，加强团结，统一思想，统一行动，所以能够带领群众紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，不断打胜仗。革委会成立将近半年来，已经先后举办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班一百多期；革命大批判不断深入开展；革委会带领广大革命群众主动向阶级敌人进攻，揪出了一小撮混进革命队伍的坏人，并有力地打击了阶级敌人的翻案黑风，在对敌斗争中树立了革委会的革命权威。革命带动了生产，今年以来，这个厂生产月月上升。为无产阶级掌好权，用好权
    革委会的新老革命干部动作整齐，步调一致，是因为他们有着一个共同的思想基础：为无产阶级掌好权，用好权。革委会刚成立的时候，新老革命干部之间思想上还有些隔阂。针对这一情况，他们决定举办学习班，用毛泽东思想破私立公，解决新老干部的关系问题。
    这个学习班，吸收了从厂部到车间的革委会和造反队负责人一百多人参加，学习了毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区时所作的重要指示、《湖南农民运动考察报告》和“老三篇”，由头头带头，斗私批修。通过学习，新老干部的思想觉悟大提高，把两条心合成了一条心。彼此看到了对方的长处，产生了互相学习的强烈愿望和要求。有的老干部以前看到新干部讨论工作时，经常大争大辩，有点看不惯。后来，他们发现争辩的结果，能使大家把各种意见充分发表出来，使工作设想得更周到，避免片面性。于是，他们也就毫无顾虑地积极参加争辩了。有些老干部过去经常坐在办公室里，靠听汇报了解下面的情况，严重脱离群众。现在，他们学习新干部密切联系群众的作风，经常到车间同工人谈心，厂休日或节日里，同新干部一起到职工家里去访问。遇到重大的事情，他们也能和工人商量。许多新干部，学习了老干部的工作经验和工作方法，政策水平、组织能力提高了，也学会了做政治思想工作。两股力量紧紧拧成一股绳
    由于各自看到了对方的长处，新老革命干部进一步体会到革命的“三结合”领导班子的巨大优越性。彼此之间的革命感情进一步加深了，他们在工作上互相帮助，互相支持，团结一致，紧密合作。
    有一个时期，厂里的一小撮地、富、反、坏、右分子，以批判资产阶级反动路线为名，要“平反”，并对老干部进行威胁。这时，新干部坚决支持老干部挺起身来，同一小撮妄图翻案的阶级敌人进行针锋相对的斗争，及时煞住了妖风，打退了阶级敌人的猖狂进攻。
    有一个负责领导生产的老干部，习惯于就业务抓业务，每天忙忙碌碌，生产还是抓不好。革委会常委、新干部陶永根，有一天了解到二车间焊接头小组通过学习毛主席著作，革命积极性空前高涨，在任务重、人力紧张的情况下，千方百计提前完成任务，还发扬协作精神，帮助兄弟小组完成任务。他发现这个先进苗子以后，马上和那位抓生产的老干部商量，建议他召开现场会议，表彰这个小组的先进思想。这个会议一开，职工们立即掀起了比学赶帮的热潮，使生产普遍提高。这件事使那个老干部受到很大的教育，懂得了必须用政治来统帅生产。
    老干部把培养新干部看成是自己的革命责任，满腔热忱地帮助他们成长。新干部有了什么缺点，老干部用自己过去犯错误的经验教训，帮助新干部提高思想，改正缺点。
    毛主席教导我们说：“党委要完成自己的领导任务，就必须依靠党委这‘一班人’，充分发挥他们的作用。”新老革命干部互相帮助，互相支持，从而使他们在革命的三结合权力机构中的作用得到了更好的发挥，加强了革委会的战斗力。（据新华社上海二十六日电）
