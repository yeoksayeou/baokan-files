In class societies, different classes exist. Within each class, there are different strata. In political struggles, each class and stratum will have left, center, and right factions. This is an immutable law that does not change with people's will.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has drawn all classes and strata into the torrent of class struggle, making various political factions exceptionally active. They strongly manifest their political tendencies and factionalism. How to use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to analyze factionalism from a class perspective is a very important issue.

Lenin said: "Class division is the most fundamental basis for the division of political factions, and it ultimately determines the division of political factions." In class societies, all class struggles are political struggles, and they are most fully developed in the form of party struggles. Parties and political factions are tools of class struggle.

Chairman Mao said: There have always been factions within parties and parties outside parties. The bourgeoisie has different parties, such as the Democratic Party and the Republican Party in the United States, which represent the interests of the monopolistic bourgeoisie. The workers' movement also has different factions. Within the First International, there was a struggle between Marxists representing the proletariat and factions representing bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideologies such as Proudhon, Bakunin, and Lassalle. Before World War I, within the Second International, there was a struggle between the left faction represented by Lenin and the revisionist faction represented by Bernstein. Kautsky was a centrist at a certain time and became a rightist during the war. In the struggles within the Third International, Lenin and Stalin were the true leftists, Bukharin was the rightist, Trotsky was a "left" in form but right in essence, and later became an outright counter-revolutionary. Opportunism and revisionism are rightist factions within the workers' movement, the bourgeoisie's guerrilla units within the workers' movement. Their basis is the labor aristocracy, and their ideology is actually the bourgeois ideology reflected within the proletariat, attempting to corrupt the proletariat.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "Except for the desert, wherever there are people, there are left, center, and right factions. It will still be like this a hundred thousand years later." This is the truth.

Party spirit is the concentrated expression of class nature. Only the most conscious and advanced section of the proletariat, the vanguard of the proletariat, can fully and truly represent the class interests of the proletariat and the broad masses of laborers, and have the strongest proletarian party spirit. In this case, the proletarian revolutionary faction represents the proletarian party spirit. The struggle between proletarian party spirit and bourgeois factionalism that we generally talk about is actually the struggle between proletarian party spirit and bourgeois party spirit.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "In various academic fields, there can be many factions and schools, but in terms of worldview, in modern times, there are basically only two factions: the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Either it is the worldview of the proletariat or the worldview of the bourgeoisie." The various factions that have emerged in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are basically two factions in terms of worldview, the factions of these two classes.

Each faction and factionalism represents the interests, views, and demands of different classes and strata. In the complex class struggle, to distinguish who is a true and complete revolutionary faction, who is a "revolutionary" in name only, and who is a counter-revolutionary, one must analyze their actual actions from a class perspective. That is, one must not only look at their slogans and speeches, but more importantly, see which class they actually stand with, whose class line they execute, and whose class interests their actions benefit.

Loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, firmly standing on the proletarian standpoint, uniting the broad masses, and fighting against the bourgeois reactionary line, and fighting against the handful of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist roaders within the party represented by China's Khrushchev and the counter-revolutionaries in society, and resolutely carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, this is the mark of the proletarian revolutionary faction, this is the proletarian party spirit.

The vanguard of the proletariat has always opposed factional strife without principles, opposed sectarianism, and opposed cliquism. As Chairman Mao said: "Within the working class, there is no fundamental conflict of interests. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason to split into two irreconcilable factions." All proletarian revolutionary factions must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and continue to advance the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China victoriously.

Stubbornly adhering to the reactionary stance of the bourgeoisie, from the right side, using right opportunism, right capitulationism, and right splitism to oppose Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, or from the "left" in form but right in essence, i.e., ultra-left, to sabotage Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, these are the stubborn manifestations of bourgeois party spirit or bourgeois factionalism.

The petty bourgeoisie is an ally of the proletariat and an important revolutionary force. However, due to its lack of revolutionary steadfastness, it is easily influenced by bourgeois factionalism. Therefore, one must be good at using Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to overcome the vacillation of the petty bourgeoisie. One must be good at using Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to strengthen the unity of the proletariat with the broad masses of laborers, strengthen the unity of the revolutionary ranks, consolidate and develop the great alliance of revolution, and closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment.

Against the factionalism of the bourgeoisie, one must resolutely expose it. If one is influenced by bourgeois factionalism and refuses to change, it is very dangerous, and one may end up joining the wrong side or even be used by bad elements. For the petty bourgeoisie, education must be strengthened. Chairman Mao teaches us: "It is necessary to guide the petty-bourgeois ideology within our ranks to the track of proletarian revolution. This is a key issue for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

There is no party spirit above class, and there is no factionalism above class. The view of no party spirit is the hypocritical, above-class view of the bourgeoisie. Factional struggle is the manifestation of class struggle. If the class content of factionalism is removed, it will be impossible to distinguish right from wrong, and it will blur the distinction between the proletarian revolutionary faction and the bourgeois reactionary faction. This is precisely what right opportunism needs to oppose the proletarian revolutionary faction and negate the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

We oppose bourgeois factionalism precisely to uphold and strengthen the factionalism of the proletarian revolutionary faction, that is, the party spirit of the vanguard of the proletariat. Lenin once said: "To openly and widely wage class struggle, one must develop strict party spirit." We must further develop strict proletarian party spirit, be steadfast Mao Zedong Thought proletarian revolutionaries, resolutely oppose the bourgeois rightists, oppose the "left" in form but right in essence ultra-leftists, carry out the struggle between the two lines to the end, and achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    对派性要进行阶级分析
    《红旗》杂志评论员
    在阶级社会中，存在不同的阶级。在各个阶级内部，又存在不同的阶层。各个阶级和阶层，在政治斗争中，都会有左、中、右各派的区分。这是不以人们意志为转移的普遍规律。
    无产阶级文化大革命，把各个阶级、各个阶层卷进了阶级斗争的激流，各派政治力量空前活跃起来，强烈地表现出各自的政治倾向，表现出各自的派性。怎样用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想对派性作阶级分析，是一个十分重要的问题。
    列宁说：“阶级划分是政治派别划分的最根本的基础，它归根到底总是决定着政治派别的划分的。”在阶级社会中，一切阶级斗争都是政治斗争，并以党派斗争的形式最充分地展开。政党和政治派别是阶级斗争的工具。
    毛主席说：党外有党，党内有派，历来如此。资产阶级有不同的党派，例如美国的民主党和共和党，就是代表垄断资产阶级利益的两派。工人运动内部也有不同的党派。在第一国际内部，有代表无产阶级的马克思主义者同代表资产阶级、小资产阶级思潮的蒲鲁东、巴枯宁、拉萨尔等派别的斗争。第一次世界大战以前，第二国际有以列宁为代表的左派同伯恩斯坦等修正主义派别的斗争，考茨基曾经在一定时候是中派，大战中变成了右派。在第三国际的斗争中，列宁、斯大林是真正的左派，布哈林是右派，托洛茨基是形“左”实右派，后来变成赤裸裸的反革命派。机会主义、修正主义派别是工人运动中的右派，是资产阶级在工人运动内部的别动队，它的基础就是工人贵族，它的思想，实际上是反映在工人阶级内部、企图腐蚀工人阶级的资产阶级思想。
    毛主席指出：“除了沙漠，凡有人群的地方，都有左、中、右，一万年以后还会是这样。”这是真理。
    党性是阶级性的集中表现。只有无产阶级中最有觉悟的最先进的部队，即无产阶级的先锋队，才能完整地、真正地代表无产阶级的阶级利益以及广大劳动群众的利益，才能有最强烈的无产阶级的党性。在这种情况下，无产阶级革命派就是代表无产阶级党性。我们一般所说的无产阶级党性和资产阶级派性的斗争，也就是无产阶级党性和资产阶级党性的斗争。
    毛主席指出：“在各个学术部门可以有许多派、许多家，可是就世界观来说，在现代，基本上只有两家，就是无产阶级一家，资产阶级一家。或者是无产阶级的世界观，或者是资产阶级的世界观。”在无产阶级文化大革命中出现的许多派别，就其世界观来说，基本上就是两大家，就是这两大阶级的党派性。
    各个派别，各种派性，都代表着不同阶级、不同阶层的利益、观点和要求。在错综复杂的阶级斗争中，要辨别谁是真正的、完全的革命派，谁是口头“革命派”，谁是反革命派，就必须根据他们的实际行动，进行阶级分析。就是说，不仅要看他们的口号和言论，更重要的，是看他们实际上站在那个阶级一边，执行的是那个阶级的路线，他们的行动对那个阶级有利。
    忠于伟大领袖毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，坚定地站在无产阶级立场，团结广大群众，向资产阶级反动路线作斗争，向以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的党内一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派和社会上的反革命分子作斗争，决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，这就是无产阶级革命派的标志，就是无产阶级的党性。
    无产阶级先锋队历来反对无原则的派别纠纷，反对山头主义，反对宗派主义。正如毛主席说的：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”一切无产阶级革命派，都必须遵照毛主席的这一个教导，使我国的无产阶级文化大革命继续胜利地前进。
    顽固地坚持资产阶级反动立场，从右的方面，用右倾机会主义、右倾投降主义、右倾分裂主义，来反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，或者从形“左”实右即极“左”方面，来破坏毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，这些都是资产阶级党性或资产阶级派性的顽强表现。
    小资产阶级是无产阶级的同盟军，是革命的重要力量。但是，由于它缺乏革命的坚定性，就容易受资产阶级派性的影响。因此，必须善于用毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，来克服小资产阶级的动摇性。必须善于用毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，来加强无产阶级同广大劳动群众的团结，加强革命队伍的团结，巩固和发展革命的大联合，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。
    对于资产阶级的派性，必须坚决给以揭露。谁如果受资产阶级派性的影响而又坚持不改，那是很危险的，那就有可能站错队，甚至被坏人利用。对于小资产阶级要加强教育。毛主席教导我们：“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题。”
    世界上没有超阶级的党性，也没有超阶级的派性。无党性的观点，是资产阶级虚伪的超阶级观点。派别斗争是阶级斗争的表现。如果抽掉了派性的阶级内容，就会分不清是非，就会抹杀无产阶级革命派和资产阶级反动派的区别。这正是右倾机会主义反对无产阶级革命派、否定无产阶级文化大革命所需要的。
    我们反对资产阶级派性，正是为了维护和增强无产阶级革命派的派性，即无产阶级先锋队的党性。列宁曾经说过：“为了公开地和广泛地进行阶级斗争，必须发展严格的党性。”我们要进一步发展严格的无产阶级党性，做坚定的毛泽东思想的无产阶级革命派，坚决反对资产阶级右派，反对形“左”实右的极“左”派，把两条路线的斗争进行到底，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
