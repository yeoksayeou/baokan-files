Recently, one afternoon, Wang Zhongzhen, a member of the Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the Party Branch Secretary of Baiyao Brigade in Jiuchang Commune, Modun County, returned from a meeting in the province. We invited her to give a report to our troops. After Wang Zhongzhen finished her report, it was already late. Everyone suggested she stay overnight in the troops and return the next day. Wang Zhongzhen refused. She said, “The brigade is having a meeting tonight, and the commune members are waiting for me to return to convey the spirit of the provincial meeting.”

It is more than twenty miles to Baiyao Brigade, and it was almost dark. Should we let her walk? Comrades were worried. The commanding officer decided to send a car to take her back. However, she declined. After she left, some comrades suggested, “She won’t ride in a small car, so let’s send her back on a motorcycle!” The commanding officer agreed, and I was ordered to chase after her on a motorcycle. I chased for a while but didn’t see her. I thought she couldn’t have walked so fast, so I must have missed her. I turned the motorcycle around and searched for her along the way. At a bend in the road, I encountered her. It turned out that she had seen my motorcycle approaching from behind and had stepped to the side of the road, so I didn’t see her. This time, I met her at the bend in the road.

I said to her, “Comrade Wang Zhongzhen, the commanding officer sent me to take you back. Please get on the motorcycle!”

She said, “I prefer to walk.”

I knew that Wang Zhongzhen was not one to easily accept a ride, so I persuaded her, saying, “Using the car to take you back is for the needs of your work. Today, you must ride in the car.”

Wang Zhongzhen said, “Comrade Chen, we must remember Chairman Mao’s teachings: ‘To make revolution, we must be thrifty’ and ‘Save every penny for the war and the revolutionary cause.’ We must consider and handle everything according to the principle of thrift.”

I said, “The car has already been sent out, if you don’t ride in it, it will be a waste. Besides, it’s getting dark, and you still have twenty miles to walk back to the meeting. If you’re late, everyone will be waiting for you, and if each person waits for an hour, that will be a big waste.”

As Wang Zhongzhen and I were walking and debating, two commune members driving a horse-drawn cart came from the front. I recognized them and explained the situation about sending a car for Wang Zhongzhen. They also persuaded her to ride in my motorcycle. Wang Zhongzhen still did not listen. I tried my best to pull her onto the motorcycle, but she wouldn’t get on. We continued walking and debating. When we reached the entrance of Putuo Brigade, we encountered two commune members resting by the road after cutting grass. I asked them to judge whether Wang Zhongzhen should ride in the car today. They all said: she should.

However, Wang Zhongzhen still refused to ride. She said, “Chairman Mao teaches us: ‘The Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is longer, the work is greater, and more arduous. … We must make our comrades continue to maintain the spirit of hard struggle.’ After we proletarian revolutionaries take power, we must remember Chairman Mao’s teachings, learn from the revolutionary old comrades, and carry forward the spirit of hard work and simplicity. Walking is not just about toughening my feet, but more importantly, it’s about tempering my thoughts. Only by tempering my thoughts can I avoid becoming detached from the masses.”

Wang Zhongzhen’s words educated me and convinced me. I had no choice but to return with an empty car. The two commune members who were cutting grass said emotionally, “Our brigade secretary has become a member of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee, but she is still as hardworking and simple as before. With such good revolutionary successors, we can rest assured!”

### 有这样好的接班人，我们就放心了

    有这样好的接班人，我们就放心了
    最近的一天下午，贵州省革命委员会常委、修文县久长公社白窑大队党支部书记王忠珍同志从省里开完会回来，我们部队请她作报告。王忠珍同志作完报告，天色不早了，大家留她在部队住一夜，第二天再回去。王忠珍同志不肯。她说：“今晚大队要开会，社员们都等着我回去贯彻省里的会议精神。”
    到白窑大队有二十多里，天快黑了，让她走吗？同志们放心不下。部队首长决定派车送她回去。但是，她谢绝了。她走以后不久，有的同志又建议：“小汽车她不坐，开部摩托车送吧！”首长也同意，就叫我开着摩托车追去。追了一段路，没有见她的影子。我想，她不会走得这么快，可能错过了。我又把车子倒回来，沿路找她，在一个拐弯的地方，碰上了她。原来，她看到我的车子从后边赶上来，就往路边一躲，使我没有看到她。这回，我在拐弯的地方同她碰了头。
    我对她说：“王忠珍同志，首长派我送你回去，快上车吧！”
    她说：“我走路好。”
    我知道王忠珍同志是不轻易坐车的，就劝她说：“用车送你回去，是你的工作需要。今天你非坐车不可。”
    王忠珍同志说：“小陈同志，我们要牢记毛主席‘要节约闹革命’、‘节省每一个铜板为着战争和革命事业’的教导，想问题、办事情都应根据节约的方针。”
    我说：“车子没有开出来，你不坐是节约，车子已经开出来了，你不坐，我开空车回去，这不是浪费吗？再说，天快黑了，你还要赶二十里路回去开会，要是迟到了，大家等你一人，每人等上一个小时，就是大浪费。”
    我和王忠珍同志正在边走边辩论，恰好前面来了两个赶马车的社员，我看有些面熟，就把派车送王忠珍同志的情况向他们说了。他们也劝她坐我的摩托车。王忠珍同志还是不听劝说，我使尽力气拉她也拉不上车。我和她就又边走边辩论起来。走到普陀大队寨子门口，遇着两个割草回来的社员在路边休息。我又请他们评评理，让他们说说今天这次车王忠珍同志应不应该坐？他们也都说：应该坐。
    可是，王忠珍同志还是不坐。她说：“毛主席教导我们：‘中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。……务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。’我们无产阶级革命派掌权以后，一定要牢记毛主席的教导，要向革命的老前辈学习，发扬艰苦朴素的作风。我走路不光是炼脚板劲，更主要的是炼思想，只有炼好思想，才不会脱离群众。”
    王忠珍同志这番话，教育了我，说服了我，我只好开着空车回去。那两个割草的社员感动地说：“我们的支部书记当了省革命委员会常委，还和原来一样艰苦朴素。有这样好的革命接班人，我们就放心了！”
