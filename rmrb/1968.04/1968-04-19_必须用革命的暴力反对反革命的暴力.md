We, the proletarian revolutionaries of the Kongzhi Jiguan, enthusiastically hail the publication of the great leader Chairman Mao's statement "In Support of the Black People's Struggle Against Violence in the United States"! We resolutely support Chairman Mao's statement in support of the black people's struggle against violence in the United States!

Chairman Mao's statement fully expresses the revolutionary will of the 700 million Chinese people who are striving for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It strongly supports the struggle for liberation of the black people in the United States and all oppressed peoples and nations. It profoundly and scientifically analyzes the class essence of the black people's struggle against violence in the United States, clearly pointing out the correct path for the black people and the broad masses of laborers in the United States, as well as all oppressed peoples and nations around the world, in their struggle for freedom and liberation.

Our great leader Chairman Mao points out: "Martin Luther King is a proponent of non-violence, but the American imperialists did not show him any tolerance; instead, they used counter-revolutionary violence to carry out bloody suppression against him." This fact once again teaches the black people in the United States and all oppressed peoples and nations around the world that only by using revolutionary violence to counter counter-revolutionary violence can they break their shackles.

All exploiting classes in the world mainly rely on counter-revolutionary violence to maintain their class interests and their reactionary rule. The monopolistic bourgeoisie in the United States has always relied on a massive state apparatus to brutally exploit and enslave the black masses in the United States, implementing savage racial discrimination policies and madly suppressing the resistance of the black masses. This year, the ruling clique in the United States has suppressed the black struggle to an unprecedented scale in American history. They have mobilized tens of thousands of troops, used machine guns and armored vehicles, and even secret weapons for "controlling riots," attempting to extinguish the flames of the black people's struggle in the United States.

However, the laws of class struggle are always like this: where there is oppression, there is resistance; the more severe the oppression, the more intense the resistance. The more brutally the ruling clique in the United States suppresses, the more it ignites the flames of the black people's struggle. The broad black masses in the United States are gradually awakening to the deceptive tricks of the American ruling clique's "democracy," "freedom," and "civil rights laws" in the harsh class struggle, and gradually realizing that only by taking up arms to fight can they find a way out. This time, the black people in the United States have launched an unprecedented scale of armed struggle against violence, which is a sign of the further awakening of the broad black masses.

Now the world has entered a new era of revolution with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner. The revolutionary movements of the peoples of all countries are surging forward. As Chairman Mao pointed out: "The struggle of the black people in the United States for liberation is a component part of the total struggle of the people of the world against American imperialism, and a component part of the contemporary world revolution." The struggle of the black people in the United States is mutually supportive and inspiring with the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries.

We, the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the people of the entire nation, resolutely respond to the call of our great leader Chairman Mao, resolutely support the just struggle of the black people in the United States, and resolutely support the struggle for liberation of all oppressed peoples and nations in the world. "Let the people of the world unite more closely, launch a sustained and fierce offensive against our common enemy, American imperialism and its running dogs!" "Sweep away all harmful elements, and there will be no enemies left!"

    必须用革命的暴力反对反革命的暴力
    空直机关无产阶级革命派
    我们空直机关无产阶级革命派，最热烈地欢呼伟大领袖毛主席《支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明》的发表！最坚决地拥护伟大领袖毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明！
    毛主席的声明，充分表达了正在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的七亿中国人民的革命意志，有力地支持了美国黑人和一切被压迫人民、被压迫民族的解放斗争，精辟地、科学地分析了美国黑人抗暴斗争的阶级实质，明确地指出了美国黑人和广大的劳动人民以及世界上一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族争取自由解放斗争的正确道路。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：“马丁·路德·金是一个非暴力主义者，但美帝国主义者并没有因此对他宽容，而是使用反革命的暴力，对他进行血腥的镇压。”这个事实又一次教育了美国黑人和全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族，只有用革命的暴力来对付反革命的暴力，才能打碎自己身上的枷锁。
    世界上一切剥削阶级都是主要依靠反革命暴力来维护他们的阶级利益，维护他们的反动统治的。美国的垄断资产阶级一向靠着庞大的国家机器，对美国的黑人群众进行残酷的剥削和奴役，推行野蛮的种族歧视政策，疯狂地镇压黑人群众的反抗。今年，美国统治集团对黑人斗争的镇压，更是达到了美国历史上前所未有的规模。它们调集了五、六万军队，动用了机关枪、装甲车，直到什么“控制骚乱”的秘密武器，妄图扑灭美国黑人的斗争烈火。
    但是，阶级斗争的规律总是这样，哪里有压迫，哪里就有反抗；压迫愈厉害，反抗愈激烈。美国统治集团越是野蛮镇压，就越加激起黑人斗争的怒火。美国广大的黑人群众正是在严酷的阶级斗争中，逐渐识破了美国统治集团的“民主”、“自由”、“民权法案”等等骗人的花招，逐渐懂得了只有拿起枪杆子进行斗争才有出路。这一次美国黑人掀起了空前规模的武力抗暴斗争风暴，正是标志着广大黑人群众的进一步觉醒。
    现在世界已经进入以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的革命新时代。世界各国人民的革命运动正在日益高涨。正如毛主席所指出的：“美国黑人争取解放的斗争，是全世界人民反对美帝国主义的总斗争的一个组成部分，是当代世界革命的一个组成部分。”美国黑人的斗争同各国人民的革命斗争是互相支援、互相鼓舞的。
    我们中国人民解放军和全国人民，坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，坚决支持美国黑人的正义斗争，坚决支持世界上一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族的解放斗争。“全世界人民更紧密地团结起来，向着我们的共同敌人美帝国主义及其帮凶们发动持久的猛烈的进攻！”“要扫除一切害人虫，全无敌。”
