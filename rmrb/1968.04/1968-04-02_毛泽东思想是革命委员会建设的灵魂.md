In the midst of a great situation both domestically and internationally, and amidst the triumphant songs of victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the important editorial "Revolutionary Committees Are Good" published in *People's Daily*, *Red Flag* magazine, and *Liberation Army Daily* has conveyed our great leader Chairman Mao's extremely important latest instructions on revolutionary committees, pointing out the fundamental direction for the construction of revolutionary committees. We feel immensely joyful and enthusiastic, shouting a thousand and ten thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live forever!

Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions are the great program for building proletarian revolutionary power, possessing extremely important strategic significance. We resolutely follow and unconditionally implement them.

Our district revolutionary committee has been established for a year. Under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the district revolutionary committee has led the 700,000 revolutionary people of the entire district to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, firmly grasp the direction of struggle, consolidate and develop revolutionary great alliances and revolutionary three-in-one combinations, and achieve new victories in revolution and production. The practice of the past year has made us deeply realize that great Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of revolutionary committee construction; acting according to Mao Zedong Thought means victory is guaranteed.

Actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought is fundamental

The fundamental task of revolutionary committees is to grasp the power to popularize Mao Zedong Thought and to grasp the power to learn, execute, propagate, and defend the highest directives. This is the fundamental guarantee for consolidating revolutionary power. In the past, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the old district committee and district people's committee fiercely opposed actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, aiming to take the capitalist road. We want to carry out socialist revolution, so we must rely on Mao Zedong Thought and actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought.

After the establishment of our district revolutionary committee, we vigorously promoted the mass movement of actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, achieving unprecedented widespread popularization of Mao Zedong Thought. However, when the revolutionary committee was first established last year, we were once busy with administrative tasks and did not promptly and vigorously grasp the intensive study of Chairman Mao's works and revolutionary criticism, resulting in a period of confusion among the masses and cadres. Later, after studying Chairman Mao's teachings on "political work being the lifeline of all economic work," we drew lessons, vigorously promoted the intensive study and application of Chairman Mao's works, and launched a fierce criticism of the capitalist reactionary line, transforming the appearance of all fronts. We also established Mao Zedong Thought study classes, promoting revolutionary great alliances and revolutionary three-in-one combinations. From practice, we deeply felt that no matter how much we grasp, if we do not grasp the fundamental task of actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, it is all in vain; as long as we grasp the fundamental task of actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, direct everything, transform everything, and promote everything, revolution and production will achieve one victory after another.

Firmly grasp the key of class struggle

Revolutionary committees must firmly grasp the key of class struggle. Our district revolutionary committee was established after a serious struggle against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism within our own ranks. After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, class struggle remains extremely sharp and complex. Based on Chairman Mao's teachings of "never forgetting class struggle" and "class struggle, once grasped, works wonders," we closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, vigorously promoting revolutionary criticism and struggle-criticism-transformation. Experiences such as the one from the Sixth Girls' Middle School in the city, where revolutionary criticism promoted revolutionary great alliances, drove forward the revolutionary great alliances throughout the district; and the experience from the district clock and eyeglass company, where revolutionary criticism liberated cadres, promoted the revolutionary three-in-one combinations throughout the district. After the Party Central Committee issued the great call to further extensively and deeply criticize the party's biggest handful of capitalist-roaders politically, ideologically, and theoretically, we launched a new high tide of studying Mao Chairman's works and revolutionary criticism, achieving "all red" revolutionary great alliances throughout the district first in the city. Recently, we have been firmly grasping class struggle according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions, further exposing the cover of class struggle, uncovering a handful of class enemies hiding within various levels of revolutionary committees and revolutionary mass organizations, consolidating revolutionary committees and revolutionary mass organizations. In the struggle, the revolutionary nature, representativeness, and proletarian authority of the district revolutionary committee have been enhanced. The political enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary masses has reached an unprecedented height.

We deeply feel that class struggle must be emphasized every day, every month, and every year, in large meetings and small meetings. Revolutionary committees are good precisely because they are command centers that firmly grasp class struggle; if class struggle is not grasped, revisionism will emerge, and the color of revolutionary power will change. We must continue to firmly grasp class struggle, continuously revolutionize, and continuously advance.

Resolutely exercise power with proletarian party spirit

Revolutionary committees must exercise power with proletarian party spirit. After the establishment of the district revolutionary committee, there was once a situation where some committee members made decisions independently, and there were also some manifestations of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, as well as localism and liberalism. These all hindered the correct exercise of power.

Later, we studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "must guide the petty-bourgeois ideology within our ranks to the track of proletarian revolution" and related brilliant works, held several sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, conducted open rectification, and carried out criticism and self-criticism. This way, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, anarchism, localism, and other issues were gradually overcome. The arrogance of some new cadres and the fearfulness of some old cadres also improved significantly. Now, old and new cadres help, learn, and promote each other, complement each other's strengths and weaknesses, and jointly improve. The district revolutionary committee gradually embodies the exercise of power with proletarian party spirit, and work is progressing smoothly.

Closely connect with the masses, take root among the masses

Revolutionary committees must closely connect with the masses and take root among the masses. The revolutionary committee is composed of representatives of revolutionary masses, representatives of the army, and representatives of revolutionary cadres, thus creating organizational conditions for close connection with the masses. However, some old cadres, due to old habits, often satisfy themselves with sitting in the office, easily becoming detached from the masses. Some new cadres, due to changes in their status, also showed some signs of special treatment and wastefulness. In response to this situation, we repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's works "Put Down Your Burdens, Start Your Engines" and Chairman Mao's teachings on "must maintain the humble, prudent, modest, and unassuming style, must maintain the style of hard struggle" and "be both an official and a common person." Everyone decided to improve their style, go deep into the grassroots, go deep among the masses, and study, criticize, and labor with the masses. This improved the relationship between cadres and the masses and overcame some phenomena of special treatment and extravagance.

In our actual work, we also felt that a large organization with too many personnel would inevitably lead to bureaucracy and detachment from the masses, and we must follow the principle of "streamlining administration" to form a compact leading cadre team. Currently, we are taking steps to improve this. We must better achieve unified leadership, thoroughly change the past phenomena of overlapping organizations, excessive personnel, and officials acting like lords, and achieve the revolutionization of cadres' thoughts and the revolutionization of offices.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions on revolutionary committees, we must better actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, firmly grasp class struggle, deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, continuously launch proactive attacks on class enemies, thoroughly smash the evil plots of a handful of class enemies attempting to overthrow the newly born revolutionary committees, further consolidate revolutionary committees, and seize the overall victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    毛泽东思想是革命委员会建设的灵魂
    上海市黄浦区革命委员会主任　王子华
    在国内外一片大好形势下，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》的重要社论《革命委员会好》，传达了我们伟大领袖毛主席关于革命委员会的极其重要的最新指示，为我们指明了革命委员会建设的根本方向。我们感到无比的欢欣鼓舞，千遍万遍地高呼：毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    毛主席的光辉指示，是我们建设无产阶级革命政权的伟大纲领，具有极其重要的战略意义。我们坚决紧跟，不折不扣地贯彻执行。
    我们区革命委员会建立一年了。在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的指引下，区革委会带领全区七十万革命人民，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，巩固和发展了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，取得了革命和生产的新胜利。一年来的实践，使我们深深体会到：伟大的毛泽东思想是革委会建设的灵魂，按照毛泽东思想办事就无往而不胜。
    活学活用毛泽东思想是根本
    革命委员会最根本的任务，是要掌好普及毛泽东思想的权，掌好学习、执行、宣传、捍卫最高指示的权。这是巩固革命政权最根本的保证。过去，旧区委、区人委内一小撮走资派拚命反对活学活用毛泽东思想，目的就是要走资本主义道路。我们要干社会主义革命，就要靠毛泽东思想，就要活学活用毛泽东思想。
    我们区革命委员会建立以后，狠抓了活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，毛泽东思想得到空前的大普及。但是，在去年革委会刚建立时，我们也曾一度忙于事务，没有及时狠抓毛主席著作的大学习和革命的大批判，因此，群众和干部中一度思想比较混乱。以后，学习了毛主席“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导，吸取了教训，狠抓了活学活用毛主席著作，狠批资产阶级反动路线，使各条战线的面貌为之一新。我们还大办了毛泽东思想学习班，促进了革命大联合和革命三结合。我们从实践中深深体会到，千抓万抓，不抓活学活用毛泽东思想这个根本就是瞎抓；只要抓住了活学活用毛泽东思想这个根本，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，指导一切，改造一切，推动一切，革命和生产就会取得一个又一个的胜利。
      紧紧抓住阶级斗争这个纲
    革命委员会必须紧紧抓住阶级斗争这个纲。我们区革委会就是在和党内一小撮走资派进行了严重的斗争，同时跟自己队伍内部的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性进行了斗争之后才建立起来的。革委会建立以后，阶级斗争仍然十分尖锐复杂。我们根据毛主席的
  “千万不要忘记阶级斗争”、“阶级斗争，一抓就灵”的教导，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠抓了革命的大批判和斗批改。先后出现了如市六女中以革命的大批判促进革命的大联合的经验，推动了全区革命的大联合；区钟表眼镜公司在革命的大批判中解放干部的经验，推动了全区革命的三结合。党中央发出进一步广泛深入地从政治上、思想上、理论上，对党内最大的一小撮走资派开展革命大批判的伟大号召以后，我们掀起了大学毛主席著作和革命大批判的新高潮，在全市第一个实现了全区革命大联合“一片红”。最近，又以毛主席的最新指示为纲，狠抓阶级斗争，进一步揭开阶级斗争的盖子，揪出了一小撮隐藏在各级革委会、革命群众组织内的阶级敌人，巩固了革命委员会和革命群众组织。在斗争中提高了区革委会的革命性、代表性和无产阶级权威。广大革命群众的政治热情空前高涨。
    我们深深感到，阶级斗争必须天天讲，月月讲，年年讲，大会讲，小会讲。革命委员会好，就好在它是狠抓阶级斗争的指挥部；不抓阶级斗争，就会出修正主义，革命政权就会改变颜色。我们一定要把阶级斗争狠抓下去，不断革命，不断前进。
    坚决用无产阶级党性掌权
    革命委员会一定要用无产阶级党性掌权。区革委会成立以后，常委中一度出现过你决定你的，我干我的这样的情况，也有过一些资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的表现，以及本位主义、自由主义等现象。这都妨碍着掌好权、用好权。
    后来，我们学习了毛主席的“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道”的教导和有关的光辉著作，举办了几期毛泽东思想学习班，进行开门整风，开展批评与自我批评。这样，就使资产阶级、小资产阶级派性、无政府主义、本位主义等一步步地得到克服。部分新干部的骄气和一些老干部怕字当头的思想，也有了很大的克服。现在，新老干部相互帮助，相互学习，相互促进，取长补短，共同提高。区革委会逐步地体现出用无产阶级党性掌权，工作开展得比较顺利。
  密切联系群众，扎根于群众之中
    革命委员会必须密切联系群众，扎根于群众之中。革委会由革命群众的代表、军队的代表和革命干部的代表组成，这就在组织上创造了密切联系群众的条件。但是，我们一些老干部，由于旧的习惯势力，常常满足于坐办公室，容易脱离群众。有的新干部由于地位发生了变化，也出现了一些生活特殊化和铺张浪费的现象。针对这种情况，我们反复学习了毛主席著作《放下包袱，开动机器》，学习了毛主席的“务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风”和
  “既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的教导。大家决定改进作风，深入基层，深入群众，和群众同学习，同批判，同劳动。这就改善了干群关系，同时克服了某些生活特殊化和大手大脚的现象。
    我们在实际工作中还体会到，机构庞大，人员过多，势必产生官僚主义，脱离群众，必须根据“精兵简政”的原则，搞一个精悍的领导班子。目前，已在着手改进。我们要更好地实现一元化的领导，彻底改变过去那种机构重叠、人浮于事、当官做老爷的现象，实现干部思想革命化和机关革命化。
    在毛主席关于革命委员会的最新指示的指引下，我们一定要更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠抓阶级斗争，深入开展革命大批判，不停顿地向阶级敌人主动进攻，彻底粉碎一小撮阶级敌人妄图颠覆新生的革命委员会的罪恶阴谋，进一步巩固革命委员会，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
