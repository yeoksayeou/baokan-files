The revolutionary committee of Gudang Commune in Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, has earnestly studied and resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They have overcome rightist tendencies, taken class struggle as the key link, and mobilized and relied on the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to launch a proactive offensive against the enemies of the proletariat. They have smashed the enemies' attempts at a comeback, further established the revolutionary authority of the revolutionary committee, and greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary people.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution that touches people to their very souls and constitutes a more profound and thorough process of struggle than anything that has happened in the history of the world; it is a great revolution that is being carried out by the proletariat and the broad masses of revolutionary people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao against the bourgeoisie and all other exploiting classes; it is a great revolution that is being carried out by the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the sphere of the superstructure, in the sphere of ideas; it is a great revolution that is being carried out by the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the sphere of the economic base, in the sphere of the relations of production." The members of the Gudang Commune Revolutionary Committee have studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions earnestly and have been deeply educated. They said: The facts of class struggle in our commune fully prove Chairman Mao's brilliant judgment. We must always be on guard against and smash the enemies' attempts at a comeback and resolutely repel the enemies' attempts at a comeback.

After the establishment of the revolutionary committee of Gudang Commune, a handful of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have not been reformed, and unrepentant capitalist-roaders within the Party, have joined forces to sabotage and disrupt the situation every day and every moment. In the current favorable situation, some cadres and commune members have relaxed their class vigilance. With the help of the People's Liberation Army stationed in the commune, the revolutionary committee recently held a class on the thought of Mao Zedong for cadres above the production team level. They organized them to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's statements and latest instructions on class and class struggle, and through them, mobilized the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to launch a proactive offensive against the class enemies. They exposed those class enemies who were sabotaging the Cultural Revolution and spring plowing and production and paraded them in public. A rich peasant element, in collusion with other ghosts and snakes, engaged in speculation and profiteering, and madly carried out revenge against the poor and lower-middle peasants. The members of the revolutionary committee of the commune, the revolutionary leading cadres of the production brigade, and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants together exposed the criminal activities of this rich peasant element. Everyone angrily said: The enemy wants to carry out revenge and wants to ride on our heads again, which is absolutely impossible. We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings, strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, allow the enemy to behave properly, and not allow them to make trouble. After the class consciousness of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres was further raised, they also exposed that some enemies of the proletariat used various means to win over and corrupt our cadres and revolutionary masses and attempted to carry out capitalist restoration. These facts gave the broad masses a living class struggle lesson, and everyone expressed that they must firmly remember Chairman Mao's great teachings of "never forget class struggle," resolutely launch a proactive offensive against the class enemies, not give them a chance to breathe, and maintain the proletarian authority of the newly born revolutionary committee.

The revolutionary committee of this commune also adopted methods such as combining the commune and the production brigade and combining cadres and the masses to carry out a thorough revolutionary criticism and struggle. They further criticized the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" spread by China's Khrushchev. The broad masses of cadres and masses angrily said: The class enemies have never relaxed their attacks on us, and they are trying to restore capitalism in China every moment. China's Khrushchev is lying with his eyes open, wanting us to relax our vigilance against the class enemies. We must listen to Chairman Mao's words, always maintain high revolutionary vigilance, and carry out a thorough and in-depth revolutionary criticism and struggle and rectification of our units, seize the initiative in class struggle, and consolidate the newly born revolutionary committee.

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Class struggle, once grasped, is effective." The revolutionary committee of Gudang Commune, through holding classes on the thought of Mao Zedong, grasping and firmly grasping class struggle, carrying out revolutionary criticism and struggle, has greatly aroused the class consciousness of the masses. The revolutionary production of the entire commune presents a thriving scene.

    掌握阶级斗争的主动权  巩固新生的革命委员会
    古荡公社革委会依靠贫下中农粉碎了阶级敌人翻案妖风，革命生产形势越来越好
    据新华社杭州电  浙江省杭州市古荡公社革命委员会，在解放军的帮助下，认真学习、坚决执行毛主席的最新指示，克服右倾思想，以阶级斗争为纲，发动和依靠广大贫下中农向无产阶级的敌人展开主动的进攻，粉碎了阶级敌人妄图复辟的阴谋，进一步树立了革命委员会的革命权威，大长了革命人民的志气。
    毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”古荡公社革委会成员认真学习毛主席这一最新指示，受到了深刻的教育。他们说：我们公社阶级斗争的事实，完全证明了毛主席的英明论断，我们要时刻警惕和粉碎阶级敌人企图复辟的阴谋，坚决击退阶级敌人的翻案妖风。
    古荡公社革委会成立后，一小撮没有改造好的地富反坏右分子，和党内死不悔改的走资派勾结在一起，不甘心他们的失败，每日每时企图破坏和捣乱。而在当前的大好形势下，少数干部和社员放松了阶级警惕。公社革委会在驻公社解放军的帮助下，最近举办了生产队以上干部参加的毛泽东思想学习班，组织他们反复学习毛主席有关阶级和阶级斗争的论述和最新指示，并且通过他们发动广大贫下中农主动向阶级敌人进攻，把那些破坏文化大革命和春耕生产的阶级敌人揪出来示众。有一个富农分子，勾结其他牛鬼蛇神大搞投机倒把活动，并且疯狂地向贫下中农进行反攻倒算。公社革委会委员、生产大队革命领导班子成员和广大贫下中农一起，揭露了这个富农分子的罪恶活动。大家气愤地说：敌人要想反攻倒算，妄想重新骑在我们贫下中农头上，那是万万办不到的。我们一定要牢记毛主席的教导，加强无产阶级专政，只许敌人规规矩矩，不许他们乱说乱动。广大贫下中农和革命干部的阶级觉悟进一步提高之后，他们还揭露出，有的无产阶级的敌人，利用各种手段，拉拢和腐蚀我们的干部和革命群众，企图大搞资本主义复辟活动。这些事实给广大群众上了一堂活生生的阶级斗争教育课，大家表示，一定要牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，坚决地向阶级敌人主动进攻，不给他们有喘息的机会，维护新生的革委会的无产阶级权威。
    这个公社的革命委员会还采取了社队结合、干群结合等方法，深入开展革命大批判，进一步地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫散布的“阶级斗争熄灭”论。广大干部和群众愤怒地说：阶级敌人一刻也没有放松对我们的进攻，他们每时每刻企图在中国复辟资本主义。中国赫鲁晓夫睁着眼睛说瞎话，是想让我们放松对阶级敌人的警惕，我们一定要听毛主席的话，时刻提高革命警惕性，持久深入地搞好革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改，掌握阶级斗争的主动权，巩固新生的革命委员会。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”古荡公社革委会通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，大抓狠抓阶级斗争，开展革命的大批判，大大地激发了群众的阶级觉悟，全公社的革命生产出现一片欣欣向荣的景象。
