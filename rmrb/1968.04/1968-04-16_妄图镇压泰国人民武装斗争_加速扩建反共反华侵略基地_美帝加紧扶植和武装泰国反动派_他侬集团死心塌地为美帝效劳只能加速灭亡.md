The U.S. imperialists are hastening to support and arm the Thai reactionaries in an attempt to suppress the burgeoning armed struggle of the Thai people, further turning Thailand into a U.S. colony and a military base for its aggression against Indochina, suppression of the revolution in Southeast Asia, and opposition to China.

The U.S. imperialists and the Thanom sellout clique are terrified by the rapid development of the armed struggle of the Thai people. The Johnson administration has continuously increased various forms of "aid" to the Thai reactionaries to further equip the Thai puppet army with modern weapons to "encircle and suppress" the armed forces of the Thai people. According to Thai newspapers, U.S. annual military "aid" to Thailand will increase from $40 million two years ago to $75 million this year. At the same time, the U.S. has decided to provide the Thanom clique with an additional $60 million in "special aid" to suppress the increasingly developing armed struggle of the Thai people. Various weapons and equipment provided by U.S. "aid" are being continuously shipped to Thailand. The U.S. has also decided to supply the Thanom clique with an additional 50 helicopters this year and has agreed to equip the Thai reactionary army with an "anti-aircraft missile battery."

The U.S. imperialists' direct control over the Thai puppet army is increasingly strengthening. The U.S.-Thai reactionaries, in order to deal with the people's armed forces, have decided to have the U.S. provide weapons and various military equipment and to bring in U.S. military officers from South Vietnam to serve as instructors to train the pseudo-police in so-called "guerrilla tactics."

For a long time, U.S. imperialism has used Thailand as a major military base for expanding its aggression in Indochina. The Thanom sellout clique not only provides cannon fodder for the U.S. invasion of Vietnam and directly participates in the criminal activities of massacring the Vietnamese people but also allows U.S. imperialism to establish numerous military bases on Thai territory. Nearly 80% of the bandit planes that the U.S. uses to carry out mad bombing and strafing of North Vietnam take off from Thai bases. The U.S. has long stationed B-52 strategic bombers in Thailand, and recently it has even stationed six F-111-A type fighter-bombers in Thailand. The U.S. also uses Thai bases to train the South Vietnamese puppet army. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern and Pacific Affairs William Bundy recently admitted that Thailand "has made a major contribution to us in the Vietnam War by allowing us to use its base facilities."

As the U.S. suffers continuous defeats on the Vietnam battlefield, the Johnson administration is hastening to expand its military bases in Thailand to prepare for the escalation of the aggression in Indochina. Thai puppet Deputy Minister of Defense and Chief of Staff Thawit Senaras recently revealed that U.S. imperialism will provide the Thanom sellout clique with $250 million this year to build strategic roads, airports, and military ports in Thailand. According to Thai newspapers, the U.S.-Thai reactionaries recently signed an agreement to expand the so-called "mobile construction teams," with the U.S. providing $550,000 in "aid" to increase the "mobile construction teams" from 19 to 22 this year, specifically to build strategic roads for the U.S.-Thai reactionaries to monitor and sabotage the people's revolutionary struggle.

Under the instructions of the U.S. masters, the Thanom sellout clique has also drafted a three-year plan to cooperate with the U.S. invasion of Vietnam, manufacturing weapons in Thailand to provide tools for massacring the Vietnamese people.

According to Western publications, the number of U.S. invading troops stationed in Thailand has reached 60,000. U.S. troops, supplies, and aircraft are being massively concentrated in Thailand. U.S. military bases are scattered throughout Thailand. U.S. newspapers openly admit that this is an important part of the U.S. imperialists' efforts to "contain" China.

Currently, facing the failure of the war in Vietnam and the continuous development of the people's revolutionary struggles in Southeast Asia, the collusion between the U.S.-Thai reactionaries is tightening. Under the instructions of the U.S. masters, Thai puppet Deputy Prime Minister Praphas has successively visited the Philippines, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, and other countries, shouting that "we must continue our joint support for anti-communist efforts in Vietnam." At the same time, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, "Malaysia," Australia, New Zealand, and other U.S. lackeys and running dogs are also actively participating in counter-revolutionary collusion, attempting to cobble together a new anti-China, anti-communist, and anti-people military alliance in Southeast Asia. According to Thai newspapers, Thai puppet Prime Minister Thanom will also visit the U.S. in May to discuss with Johnson how to further strengthen U.S.-Thai military and political "cooperation."

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "All parasites who depend on imperialism for their livelihood, no matter how they struggle for a while, their backers are unreliable. Once the tree falls, the monkeys scatter, and the whole situation changes."

Currently, U.S. imperialism, under the heavy blows of the Vietnamese people, has already fallen into a desperate and pathetic situation. The Thanom clique, which is wholeheartedly serving U.S. imperialism, will ultimately perish with U.S. imperialism. The desperate struggles of the U.S.-Thai reactionaries will not only fail to extinguish the flames of the Thai people's revolutionary struggle but will only accelerate their own doom.

    妄图镇压泰国人民武装斗争　加速扩建反共反华侵略基地
    美帝加紧扶植和武装泰国反动派
    他侬集团死心塌地为美帝效劳只能加速灭亡
    本报综合报道　美帝国主义正在加紧扶植和武装泰国反动派，妄图镇压正在蓬勃发展的泰国人民武装斗争，进一步把泰国变成美国的殖民地和它侵略印度支那、镇压东南亚革命、反对中国的军事基地。
    美帝国主义和他侬卖国集团对于泰国人民武装斗争的迅速发展怕得要命。约翰逊政府不断增加对泰国反动派的各种“援助”，以便进一步把泰国傀儡军队用现代化装备武装起来，“围剿”泰国人民武装力量。据泰国报纸报道，美国向泰国提供的常年军事“援助”，将从两年前的四千万美元剧增到今年的七千五百万美元。同时，美国还决定向他侬集团提供六千万美元的“特别援助”，来镇压日益发展的泰国人民的武装斗争。美国“援助”的各种武器和装备，正在源源运往泰国。美国还决定在今年内再供给他侬集团五十架直升飞机，并且答应给泰国反动军队装备一个“防空导弹连”。
    美帝国主义对泰国傀儡军队的直接控制日益加强。美泰反动派为了对付人民武装，决定由美国提供武器和各种军事仪器，并从南越调来美国军官担任教官，对伪警察进行所谓“游击战术”的训练。
    长期以来，美帝国主义一直把泰国作为扩大侵略印度支那的主要军事基地。他侬卖国集团不仅为美帝侵越战争提供炮灰，直接参与屠杀越南人民的罪恶活动，而且让美帝国主义在泰国领土上建立大量军事基地。美帝国主义对越南北方进行疯狂轰炸和扫射的强盗飞机，有将近百分之八十是从泰国基地起飞的。美国早就把B—52型战略轰炸机进驻泰国，最近竟然又把六架F111—A型战斗轰炸机进驻泰国。美国还利用泰国基地来训练南越傀儡军队。美国国务院远东和太平洋事务助理国务卿威·邦迪最近供认，泰国“在越南战争方面让我们使用基地设施而作出重大贡献”。
    随着在越南战场上的不断失败，约翰逊政府正加紧扩建在泰国的军事基地，为扩大侵略印度支那战争作准备。泰国傀儡国防部副部长兼总参谋长他威·尊拉塞最近透露，美帝国主义将在今年内向他侬卖国集团提供二亿五千万美元，作为在泰国修筑战略公路、机场和军用码头的费用。据泰国报纸报道，美泰反动派最近签订了一项扩充所谓“流动建设队”的协定，由美国提供价值五十五万美元的“援助”，以便在今年内把“流动建设队”从十九队扩充到二十二队，专门为美泰反动派修筑战略公路，监视和破坏人民革命斗争。
    在美国主子的指使下，他侬卖国集团还拟订了一项配合美国侵越战争的三年计划，在泰国制造军火，提供屠杀越南人民的武器。
    据西方报刊透露，驻在泰国的美国侵略军已达六万人。美国军队、物资和飞机正在泰国大量集结。美国的军事基地遍布泰国。美国报纸直认不讳地说，这是美帝国主义“遏制中国的努力的重要部分”。
    目前，面对侵越战争的失败和东南亚各国人民革命斗争的不断发展，美泰反动派的勾结日益加紧。泰国傀儡政府副总理巴博在美国主子指使下，先后到菲律宾、台湾、日本、南朝鲜等地活动，叫嚷“必须继续我们对越南反共努力的联合支持”。同时，印度、印尼、菲律宾、“马来西亚”、澳大利亚、新西兰等美帝仆从和走狗也纷纷出动，进行反革命串连，妄图在东南亚拼凑一个新的反华、反共、反人民的军事联盟。据泰国报纸报道，泰国傀儡总理他侬也将于五月间到美国活动，同约翰逊讨论如何进一步加强美泰军事和政治“合作”的问题。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“一切依靠帝国主义过活的寄生虫，不论如何蠢动于一时，他们的后台总是靠不住的，一旦树倒猢狲散，全局就改观了。”
    目前，美帝国主义在越南人民的沉重打击下，已经陷于走投无路的狼狈境地。死心塌地为美帝国主义效劳的他侬集团，到头来只能为美帝国主义殉葬。美泰反动派的垂死挣扎，不但扑灭不了泰国人民革命斗争的烈火，结果只能加速它们自己的灭亡。
