	Always Maintain the Spirit of an Ordinary Soldier
	Cadres must always put the "public" first and relentlessly fight against the "private" self, ensuring that Chairman Mao's thoughts deeply take root in their minds.

	Once, soldier Wang Fucheng jokingly said to me, "Now that you're an 'official,' don't forget about us soldiers!" I thought about it and realized there was a problem. I found that since I started working in the battalion, there were a few things I didn't do as well as when I was in the company: I interacted less with the soldiers, went to the field to work with them less, had fewer heart-to-heart talks with them, and went down to understand the situation less. At that moment, I realized that Wang Fucheng's words were not just a joke but a stern warning against my official arrogance.

	From then on, I followed Chairman Mao's instructions and fought against official arrogance. To get rid of this "official" mentality, I paid more attention to eating and sleeping with the soldiers. Every morning, I would run at the front during roll call. When studying Chairman Mao's works, I would discuss my thoughts with them, share my experiences, and recall hardships together. I also paired up with them in "Red Pairs," frequently had heart-to-heart talks, and carried out criticism and self-criticism, seeking their help. After that, the soldiers affectionately called me "Old Platoon Leader" again.

	Years of practice have made me deeply realize that if a person becomes arrogant, they will distance themselves from the masses, their perspective will be biased, they will handle problems incorrectly, and they will not align with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Only by thoroughly eliminating the poison of revisionism spread by the Chinese Khrushchev, fighting against the "official" mentality, can one forever maintain the spirit of an ordinary soldier and firmly establish the idea of being a lifelong old yellow cow for the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world.

	After being transferred from a higher-level organization to work here, I once encountered an incident: some guards, out of class sentiment, wanted to wash my clothes for me. I remembered Chairman Mao's teaching that "our party and state cadres are ordinary laborers, not overlords sitting on the heads of the people," and felt that this was not a small matter. Allowing them to wash one piece of clothing would make me lazier, more official, and more prone to revisionism. I felt that this was not right, so I politely declined their good intentions. From then on, I strengthened my vigilance against official arrogance, often going down to walk around and see things, and my relationship with the masses improved a lot.

	Every time I see the soldiers actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, breaking private interests and establishing public interests, I compare myself to them and think back to when I worked in the organization, often criticizing those below me. I deeply felt that I had been infected with bureaucratic habits, and it was the "official" mentality at work. The facts tell us: once the "official" mentality enters the mind, it will seriously alienate one from the masses and lead to degeneration.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "The masses are the real heroes."

	Once, the higher-ups decided that our company would switch from construction to tunnel digging. We knew nothing about tunnel digging, and I was at a loss at the time. Later, following Chairman Mao's great teaching of "from the masses, to the masses," I handed over this new task and my concerns to the masses for discussion, humbly becoming a student of the masses, and seriously listening to the soldiers' opinions. As a result, the soldiers not only proposed many effective methods and measures to complete the task but also helped me overcome the fear in my mind and taught me many good experiences of using Mao Zedong Thought to guide actions. From then on, whenever I encountered difficulties at work, I would ask the soldiers for solutions and ideas. Whenever I had private thoughts, I would ask everyone to help me fight against them. In this way, not only was the tunnel digging task relatively well completed, but my ideological transformation was also greatly promoted.

	I deeply feel that countless soldiers who are dedicated to the public have Mao Zedong Thought shining in their words and deeds. We must follow Chairman Mao's teaching of being a humble student of the masses, forever unite with the masses, and together actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, continuously transforming our worldview.

### 永远保持普通一兵的本色

    永远保持普通一兵的本色
    干部要永远保持普通一兵的本色，必须时时“公”字当头，处处狠斗“私”字，让毛泽东思想在头脑里深深扎根。
    有一次，战士王福成同志一边开玩笑一边对我说：“你当了‘官’，可别忘了我们当兵的啊！”我一细想，感到有了问题，发现自己到营里工作以来有几点不如在连队了：同战士打成一片少了，到现场同战士一起劳动少了，同战士谈心少了，亲自下去了解情况少了。这时，才感到王福成讲的不是一句玩笑话，而是狠狠地给我的官气敲了一棒。
    从此，我就照毛主席的指示办事，狠斗官气。为了斗掉这个“官”字，我更注意经常和战士们吃在一起，睡在一起。每天早晨出操，我就跑在前面。学习毛主席著作时，就和他们一起谈认识，亮思想，忆苦思甜。还和他们结成“一对红”，经常谈心，开展批评和自我批评，争取他们的帮助。从这以后，战士们又亲切地叫我“老连长”了。
    几年来的实践，使我深深体会到，一个人沾上了官气，联系群众就差，看问题就偏，处理问题就错，跟毛主席的伟大战略部署就不紧。只有彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫散布的修正主义流毒，斗掉“官”字，才能永保普通一兵的本色，牢固地树立为中国人民和世界革命人民当一辈子老黄牛的思想。

    我从上级机关调到这里工作后，曾经遇到这样一件事：有些警卫人员从阶级感情出发，要帮我洗衣服。我想起毛主席关于“我们党和国家的干部是普通劳动者，而不是骑在人民头上的老爷”的教导，觉得这不是小事，让他们洗一件衣服，自己就会让“懒”字增一分，“官”字多一尺，“修”字长一丈。我感到这样不行，便婉言谢绝了他们的好意。从此，我加强对“官”气的警惕，经常到下面去走一走，看一看，同群众的关系就好多了。
    每当我看到战士们活学活用毛主席著作、破私立公的动人情景，再对照自己，联想起过去在机关工作时，动不动就对下面指责，深深感到过去就是沾染了官僚主义作风，是“官”字作怪。事实告诉我们：头脑里有了“官”字，就会严重脱离群众，就会蜕化变质。

    毛主席教导我们说：“群众是真正的英雄”。
    有一次，上级决定我们连由搞房建改为打隧道。打隧道，我们连是一窍不通，我当时急得没办法。后来，还是遵循毛主席“从群众中来，到群众中去”的伟大教导，把这项新任务和我的顾虑，都交给群众讨论，虚心地当群众的小学生，认真地听取战士们的意见。结果，战士们不仅提出了很多有效的完成任务的方法和措施，而且帮助我斗倒了思想上的怕字，教给我许多用毛泽东思想统帅行动的好经验。从此以后，我工作上一有困难就请战士们想办法出主意，思想上一有私心杂念，就请大家帮助我斗私。这样，不仅较好地完成了打隧道任务，而且大大促进了我的思想革命化。
    我深深地体会到，无数一心为公的战士，他们的言行中经常闪烁着毛泽东思想的光辉。我们一定要按照毛主席关于甘当群众小学生的教导，永远同群众结合在一起，同群众一起活学活用毛泽东思想，不断改造自己的世界观。
