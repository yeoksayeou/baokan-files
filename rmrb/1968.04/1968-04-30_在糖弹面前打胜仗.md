In the midst of the great situation of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, our brigade's revolutionary leading group never forgets class struggle, firmly grasps the revolutionary criticism, and powerfully strikes down the dying class enemies.

One day, when brigade cadre Feng Qingbao returned from the fields, he saw a pile of yams on the ground and was puzzled. Qingbao asked his mother where the yams came from. His mother said, "Just now, the wife of the rich peasant Feng ×× sent them over, saying that our children like to eat yams and insisted on leaving them here." Qingbao heard this and exclaimed to his mother, "Chairman Mao teaches us, 'Never forget class struggle.' The rich peasant Feng ×× is our poor and lower-middle peasants' sworn enemy. In the old society, the poor peasant Zhou Grandpa went to his house to beg for food, and he kicked Zhou Grandpa out. Why is it that today his wife brings us yams? This is clearly because I have just been elected as a cadre, and they want to pull me down. These yams are poison, they are sugar-coated bullets! We must not eat them!"

That night, Qingbao and the brigade cadres analyzed this incident together. Everyone agreed that the class enemy is attacking us, and we must seize the enemy and strike them down hard. The next day, they convened a meeting of poor and lower-middle peasants in front of Qingbao's house to criticize and struggle against this rich peasant who attempted to poison the poor and lower-middle peasants.

At the meeting, all the poor and lower-middle peasants in the village were very indignant after hearing Feng Qingbao's exposure. They all rushed onto the stage to say: "The Chinese Khrushchev spreads the theory of 'extinction of class struggle,' attempting to dissolve our poor and lower-middle peasants' revolutionary fighting spirit. We must not fall for the Chinese Khrushchev's tricks and lay down our weapons in front of the enemy."

The militia company commander Xiao Yuchun said, "These yams are sugar-coated bullets, they are poison, they are the class enemy's means to split the brigade's leading group. We must resolutely expose the enemy's tricks."

After the meeting, the brigade's leading group organized a study class throughout the village for extensive and in-depth discussions. Many poor and lower-middle peasants said: The class enemy appears "obedient," but in reality, they are always thinking about reversing the situation. We must never be complacent. Old poor peasant Liu Laozheng and his wife discussed this after the study class and continued the discussion during dinner. Liu Laozheng told his children, "We, the poor and lower-middle peasants' next generation, must take over the revolutionary cause. We must keep our eyes open, distinguish between enemies and ourselves, and never fall for the enemy's tricks!"

This incident raised everyone's class consciousness. The entire brigade of poor and lower-middle peasants seized this "live target" and fiercely criticized the Chinese Khrushchev, making the revolutionary criticism more vivid and lively.

Currently, the vast number of poor and lower-middle peasants in our brigade, with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, are actively participating in the high tide of grasping revolution and promoting production.

    在糖弹面前打胜仗
    在无产阶级文化大革命一片大好形势下，我们这里的革命领导班子，念念不忘阶级斗争，狠抓革命大批判，有力地打击了垂死挣扎的阶级敌人。
    一天，我们生产大队干部冯庆保下地回来，看见地上有一堆山药，心里十分纳闷。庆保问他娘山药那来的？娘说：“刚才富农冯××的婆娘送来的，她说咱们家孩子爱吃山药，死皮赖脸要把山药放在这里。”庆保一听，叫声娘，说：“毛主席教导我们，‘千万不要忘记阶级斗争’，富农分子冯××是咱贫下中农的死对头，在旧社会，贫农周大爷到他家讨饭，他把周大爷踢了出来。为啥今天他老婆给咱送山药来呢？这不明明是看我新当选了干部，想把我拉下水。这山药是毒药，是糖衣炮弹！千万吃不得！”
    当天晚上，庆保和大队的干部一起分析了这件事情，大家一致认为：阶级敌人在向我们进攻，要揪住敌人不放，狠狠打击。第二天就在庆保家门前，召开了贫下中农大会，对这个妄图毒害贫下中农的富农分子进行了批判斗争。
    会上全村贫下中农听了冯庆保的揭发都很气愤，纷纷跳上了台说：中国赫鲁晓夫散布“阶级斗争熄灭”论，妄图瓦解我们贫下中农的革命斗志，我们决不能上中国赫鲁晓夫的当，在敌人面前放下武器。
    民兵连长肖玉春说：“这山药是糖衣炮弹，是毒药，是阶级敌人分化大队领导班子的手段，咱们坚决揭露敌人的阴谋诡计。”
    会后，生产大队领导班子组织了全村学习班进行了广泛深入的讨论。许多贫下中农说：阶级敌人表面“老实”，实际上时时刻刻想着变天，千万麻痹不得。老贫农刘老正两口子在学习班议论后，回到家里利用吃饭时间组织全家人继续讨论。刘老正对孩子说：“咱贫下中农的后一代，要接好革命的班，一定要擦亮眼睛，看清敌我，千万不能上敌人的当！”
    这件事提高了大家的阶级觉悟，全队贫下中农抓住这个“活靶子”，狠狠地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫，把革命的大批判搞得更加有声有色。
    眼下我们大队广大贫下中农怀着对毛主席的无限忠诚，积极投入到抓革命、促生产高潮中去。
