The Guinean government economic delegation, led by Minister Ismail Toure, concluded its friendly visit to China today and departed Beijing by airplane to return home. Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Qi Pengfei, Vice Chairman of the State Economic Commission Xie Huai-de, and responsible officials of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, along with over 500 revolutionary masses from the capital, went to the airport to give them a warm send-off.

Upon arriving at the capital airport amidst the sound of drums, a squad of Red Guards loudly read Chairman Mao's teachings: "The wicked system of imperialism and colonialism arose from the slave trade and the trafficking of Black people. It is also bound to perish as the Black people of the world are liberated." "The people of the world should unite more closely, launch a sustained and vigorous offensive against our common enemy, U.S. imperialism and its accomplices!" The Guinean friends warmly shook hands with the Red Guards.

The revolutionary masses gathered at the airport held up portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao, portraits of Guinean President Sekou Toure, and waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," repeatedly shouting: "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and Guinea!" "Long live the unity of the peoples of Asia and Africa!" "Firmly support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries!" "Down with U.S. imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Complete victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the invincible thought of Mao Zedong!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

Guinea's Ambassador to China, Sekou Kama, and some diplomats from other countries stationed in China also went to the airport to see them off.

    几内亚朋友在一片锣鼓声中来到首都机场以后，一队红卫兵小将高声朗读毛主席的教导：“万恶的殖民主义、帝国主义制度是随着奴役和贩卖黑人而兴盛起来的，它也必将随着黑色人种的彻底解放而告终。”“全世界人民更紧密地团结起来，向着我们的共同敌人美帝国主义及其帮凶们发动持久的猛烈的进攻！”几内亚朋友同红卫兵小将们热烈握手。
    聚集在机场上的革命群众，高举着我们伟大领袖毛主席像，举着几内亚总统杜尔像，挥动红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，不断高呼：“中几两国人民的友谊万岁！”“亚非人民团结万岁！”“坚决支持世界各国人民的革命斗争！”“打倒美帝！打倒苏修！”“无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    几内亚驻中国大使塞古·卡马拉和一些国家驻华使节，也到机场送行。
