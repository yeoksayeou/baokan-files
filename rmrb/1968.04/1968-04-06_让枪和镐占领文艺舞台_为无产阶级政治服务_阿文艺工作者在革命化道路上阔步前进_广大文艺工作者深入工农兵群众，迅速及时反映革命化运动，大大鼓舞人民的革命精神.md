Albanian literature and arts workers, following the guidance of the Party of Labor of Albania and Comrade Enver Hoxha, are actively implementing the policy of literature and arts serving proletarian politics. With profound ideological content and diverse artistic forms, they promptly and accurately reflect the current nationwide fervent ideological revolutionary movement and production construction upsurge, greatly inspiring the people's revolutionary spirit, and promoting socialist revolution and socialist construction.

At the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labor of Albania, the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, pointed out: "Literature and arts should become a powerful weapon for the Party to educate workers with socialist and communist spirit." This great directive has pointed out the direction for the broad ranks of Albanian literature and arts workers.

Broad masses of stage artists draw themes directly from the fiery class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiments, creating and performing hundreds of excellent programs.

Not long ago, in a performance attended by more than 2,200 amateur actors in Tirana, the actors themselves wrote and performed many excellent programs, timely coordinating with the revolutionary movement to oppose bureaucracy, promote atheism, oppose the backward customs of the exploiting classes, and thoroughly liberate women, widely reflecting the current struggles and life. The audience enthusiastically welcomed these programs full of fighting spirit.

Many theater troupes recently staged several modern plays with revolutionary content and national style. After staging the play "Destruction" which reflects the elimination of feudal superstitions and backward customs, and the play "One Falls, Ten Thousand Stand Up" which praises female communist Shkuta, the "People's Theater" in Tirana staged the play "Heroes of Rinas" in January this year, praising the heroes of the oil front, Muhamet Shehu and Murtaz Kapidani, who sacrificed their lives to defend the state property. The Elbasan Theater staged plays on the theme of thoroughly liberating women and reflecting the cooperative members' struggle for grain self-sufficiency. The actors also actively went to the mountains and countryside, to factories, workshops, and military camps to perform for workers, peasants, and soldiers. At the same time, amateur arts activities are also very active. The amateur actors of the Cultural Palace in Korça staged the opera "The Female Commander" on the theme of thoroughly liberating women, the workers of the "Mao Zedong Textile Factory" in Berat wrote and performed the play "Marching with the Times" reflecting workers helping each other in labor, and the folk artists' songs "The Party's Documents Are Our Food" and "Enver Comes to the Troshani Agricultural Cooperative" all received good reviews from the audience. Inspired by the selfless spirit of the people in Debar and Librazhd regions overcoming the earthquake disaster, Zeko, a middle school teacher in Korça, and Migjoni, a truck driver, wrote the play "The Front" full of revolutionary heroic spirit in a month, and performed it at the "Çajupi" Theater in Korça.

The workers of the "New Albania" Film Studio went deep into the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and into the revolutionary movement and socialist construction practice. In the past year, they have successively shot a large number of newsreels. These films truly and comprehensively reflect the revolutionary movement led by the Party and the new spirit of the Albanian people. In addition, the "New Albania" Film Studio recently successfully shot a film praising the communist warrior in the style of Adam Reka.

Painters, sculptors, and photographers also follow Comrade Enver Hoxha's instruction to "find the inspiration for creation among the people," going to factories and countryside, humbly learning from the workers and peasants.

Recently, various art exhibitions held in Tirana and other places displayed many works praising the Party and the great leader Enver Hoxha, as well as many works reflecting workers fighting by the furnace, peasants opening up hillsides, young people actively participating in voluntary labor to build railways and roads, and the realization of electrification in rural areas. The display of these works was warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the people.

When the State Song and Dance Ensemble of Albania held a performance report in Tirana during their visit to China, they sang "The Boat Needs a Helmsman" and "The Song of Enver Hoxha."

    让枪和镐占领文艺舞台　为无产阶级政治服务
    阿文艺工作者在革命化道路上阔步前进
    广大文艺工作者深入工农兵群众，迅速及时反映革命化运动，大大鼓舞人民的革命精神
    新华社地拉那四日电阿尔巴尼亚广大文艺工作者，遵循阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和霍查同志的教导，积极贯彻文艺为无产阶级政治服务的方针，以深刻的思想内容、多样化的文艺形式，迅速及时地反映了当前在全国轰轰烈烈开展的思想革命化运动和生产建设高潮，大大地鼓舞了人民的革命精神，推动了社会主义革命和社会主义建设。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖霍查同志在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会上指出：“文学和艺术应该成为党以社会主义和共产主义精神教育劳动者的有力武器。”这一伟大教导，给阿尔巴尼亚广大文艺工作者指明了前进的方向。
    广大舞台艺术工作者，从火热的阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验中直接汲取题材，创作和演出了数以百计的优秀节目。
    不久前在地拉那举行的有两千二百多名业余演员参加的会演中，演员们自编自演了许多精采节目，及时地配合了反对官僚主义、宣传无神论、反对剥削阶级落后习俗、彻底解放妇女等革命化运动，广泛地反映了当前的斗争和生活。观众们热情地欢迎这些富有战斗性的节目。
    许多剧团最近上演了不少具有革命内容和民族风格的现代戏。地拉那“人民剧院”继上演反映铲除封建迷信和落后习俗的话剧《摧毁》和歌颂女共产党员什库塔的话剧《一个人倒下去，千万人站起来》之后，今年一月又上演了歌颂为保卫国家财产不惜牺牲自己生命的石油战线上的英雄穆哈梅特·希胡和穆尔特扎·凯皮的话剧《里纳斯的英雄》。爱尔巴桑剧院上演了以彻底解放妇女为题材和反映合作社社员争取粮食自给的话剧。演员们还积极上山下乡，到工矿车间和部队营地为工农兵演出。与此同时，业余文艺活动也非常活跃。科尔察区文化宫业余演员上演的以彻底解放妇女为题材的歌剧《女队长》、培拉特“毛泽东纺织厂”的职工自编自演的反映工人在劳动中互相帮助的戏剧《与时代一起前进》以及民间艺人们的演唱歌曲《党的文件就是我们的粮食》、《恩维尔来到特洛沙尼农业社》等节目，博得了观众的好评。科尔察区的中学教师泽科和汽车司机米吉诺特在迪勃拉和利布拉什德地区人民战胜地震灾害的忘我精神的鼓舞下，以战斗姿态，在一个月的时间内写出了洋溢着革命英雄主义气概的话剧《前线》，并在科尔察“恰佑比”剧院上演。
      “新阿尔巴尼亚”电影制片厂的职工深入工农兵群众，深入革命化运动和社会主义建设实践，一年来，先后拍摄了大量新闻纪录片。这些影片真实全面地反映了在劳动党领导下开展的革命化运动和阿尔巴尼亚人民崭新的精神面貌。此外，“新阿尔巴尼亚”电影制片厂最近还成功地拍摄了歌颂亚当·雷卡式的共产主义战士的影片。
    绘画、雕塑和摄影工作者也遵照霍查同志“在人民当中寻找创作的鼓舞力量”的教导，纷纷下厂下乡，虚心向工农群众学习。
    最近在地拉那等地举办的各种艺术展览会上，展出了不少热情歌颂党、歌颂伟大领袖霍查同志的作品，还展出了工人在熔炉旁奋战、农民在山坡开荒、青年积极参加修建铁路和公路义务劳动以及农村实现电气化等许多作品。这些作品的展出，受到了广大人民群众的热烈欢迎。（附图片）
