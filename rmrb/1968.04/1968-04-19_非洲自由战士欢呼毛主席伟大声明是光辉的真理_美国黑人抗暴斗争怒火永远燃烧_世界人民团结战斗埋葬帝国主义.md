African freedom fighters in Cairo hailed Chairman Mao's great statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence as a beacon of truth on April 17. They unanimously agreed that this statement is a great encouragement to the struggle of African people against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.

Pakani Bokoto Karra, the acting representative in Cairo of the Basutoland Congress Party, said: "Chairman Mao's statement is as inspiring as his 1963 statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against racial discrimination by U.S. imperialism. It not only boosts the morale of the oppressed and trampled-upon American blacks but also greatly encourages the just cause of the revolutionary people of the world in their struggle against the common enemy, U.S. imperialism."

He said: "U.S. imperialism is doomed to perish. As Chairman Mao said, 'The evil system of colonialism and imperialism, which is based on the enslavement and trafficking of black people, will inevitably come to an end with the complete liberation of the black race.'"

Karra pointed out that the oppressed and exploited peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America have risen up. Now, American blacks have also risen up. The revolutionary torch lit by American blacks will burn forever until final victory is achieved.

Jorge Sangumba, the news secretary of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, said: "The statement issued by the great leader Chairman Mao on April 16 is very inspiring. It is not only a great support for American blacks but also a great support for the revolutionary people of the world."

He said: "We Angolan people believe that the struggle of American blacks for liberation is a great contribution to the common struggle of the world's revolutionary people against imperialism headed by the United States. Therefore, the struggle of American blacks is not isolated but has the support of the oppressed peoples of the world, including the laboring people of the United States. As Chairman Mao said, 'The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history.' No matter how ferocious U.S. imperialism and its lackeys may be, as long as the American people and the peoples of the world who are fighting are determined to persist in their struggle, final victory will surely be theirs."

Sangumba said: "We Angolan people resolutely support the struggle of our American black brothers. We will intensify our struggle against the Portuguese colonialists who are supported by the number one enemy, U.S. imperialism. Under the great call of Chairman Mao Zedong, the peoples of the world will be more closely united, deepen their struggles, and thoroughly eliminate colonialism and imperialism, so that all oppressed peoples will be completely liberated."

Nkosi, the representative in Cairo of the Swaziland Progressive Party, said: "Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence is a resounding call to the revolutionary people of the world to intensify their struggle against the common enemy, imperialism headed by the United States."

Nkosi said that Chairman Mao had long ago said: "The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war." The assassination of Martin Luther King by U.S. imperialists is a good lesson for the oppressed peoples still under the slavery of colonialism and imperialism: we must not harbor any illusions about solving political problems through 'peaceful means.' The only way to deal with U.S. imperialism is to answer unjust violence with just violence. If we allow U.S. imperialism and its running dogs to run rampant on all continents without answering them with violence, there will be no peace in the world. He pointed out that the day to uproot and thoroughly eliminate imperialism is not far off. U.S. imperialism will not have a good end.

A student from a West African country, Lanshan, said: "Chairman Mao's statement is a beacon of truth, inspiring the revolutionary people of the world, especially the blacks in the United States and Africa. This shows that Chairman Mao is very concerned about our struggle against U.S. imperialism and racial discrimination. We African people will follow Chairman Mao's teachings and strengthen our struggle." He concluded with passionate shouts: "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!"

The American blacks possess extremely powerful revolutionary forces. They will surely smash their shackles and thoroughly destroy the system of colonialism and imperialism.

    非洲自由战士欢呼毛主席伟大声明是光辉的真理
    美国黑人抗暴斗争怒火永远燃烧世界人民团结战斗埋葬帝国主义
    新华社开罗十七日电　非洲自由战士十七日在开罗向新华社记者发表谈话，热烈欢呼毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明的发表。他们一致认为，这一声明是对非洲人民反对美帝国主义及其帮凶的斗争的巨大鼓舞。
    巴苏陀兰大会党驻开罗代理代表帕卡尼·博科托·卡拉说：“毛主席的这个声明同他一九六三年《支持美国黑人反对美帝国主义种族歧视的正义斗争的声明》一样，不仅长了被压迫、被蹂躏的美国黑人的志气，而且是对全世界革命人民反对共同敌人美帝国主义的正义事业的巨大鼓舞。”
    他说：“美帝国主义是注定要灭亡的。毛主席说得好：“万恶的殖民主义、帝国主义制度是随着奴役和贩卖黑人而兴盛起来的，它也必将随着黑色人种的彻底解放而告终。””
    卡拉指出，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲被压迫和被剥削的人民已经站起来了。现在美国黑人也站起来了。美国黑人已经点燃起来的革命火炬，将永远地燃烧下去，直到取得最后胜利。
    争取安哥拉彻底独立全国联盟新闻书记若热·桑贡巴说：“伟大领袖毛主席十六日发表的声明是十分令人欢欣鼓舞的。这不仅是对美国黑人的巨大支持，也是对全世界革命人民的巨大支持。”
    他说：“我们安哥拉人民认为，美国黑人争取解放的斗争，是对世界革命人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义的共同斗争的巨大贡献。因此，美国黑人的斗争不是孤立的，而是得到了全世界被压迫人民，甚至美国白人中的劳动人民的支持。正如毛主席说的：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”不管美帝国主义及其帮凶如何穷凶极恶，只要美国人民和世界上正在斗争中的人民下定决心，坚持斗争，最后胜利一定是属于他们的。”
    桑贡巴说：“我们安哥拉人民坚决支持我们的美国黑人兄弟进行的斗争。我们将加强对得到头号敌人美帝国主义支持的葡萄牙殖民主义者的斗争。在毛泽东主席的伟大号召下，全世界人民将更紧密地团结起来，使他们的斗争深入发展，直到彻底消灭殖民主义和帝国主义，使一切被压迫人民得到彻底解放。”
    斯威士兰进步党驻开罗代表恩科西说：“毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明，是向全世界革命人民发出的加紧对共同敌人——以美国为首的帝国主义进行斗争的响亮号召。”
    恩科西说，毛主席早就说过：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。”马丁·路德·金被美帝国主义者暗杀，是对仍处于殖民主义和帝国主义奴役下的被压迫人民一个很好的教训：我们决不能对通过“和平手段”解决政治问题存在幻想。对付美帝国主义只有用正义的暴力来回答非正义的暴力。如果我们听任美帝国主义及其走狗在各大洲横行霸道，而不用暴力给以回答，世界上就不会有和平。他指出，铲除和彻底消灭帝国主义的日子，已经为期不远了。美帝国主义决不会有好下场。
    一个西非国家的学生兰山说：“毛主席的声明是光辉的真理，鼓舞着全世界革命人民，特别是美国和非洲的黑人。这表明，毛主席非常关心我们反对美帝国主义和种族歧视的斗争。我们非洲人民将遵循毛主席的教导，加强我们的斗争。”他最后满怀激情地高呼：“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！”（附图片）
    美国黑人中蕴藏着极其强大的革命力量，他们必将砸碎身上的枷锁，彻底摧毁殖民主义、帝国主义制度。
