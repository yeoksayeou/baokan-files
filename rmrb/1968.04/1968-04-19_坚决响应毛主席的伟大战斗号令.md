The Shanghai proletariat warmly acclaims and resolutely supports the great leader Chairman Mao's declaration of support for the American black people's struggle against violence, which has tremendous historical significance!

Currently, the world revolutionary situation is excellent. The great victory of the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression for national salvation has made American imperialism panic-stricken and suffer a crushing defeat. The national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are thriving. In the vast areas under the rule of American imperialism and its lackeys, the flames of armed struggle by the people are burning more fiercely. The new storm of the American black people's struggle against violence has sounded the new call for the oppressed and exploited people in the United States to rebel against the brutal rule of the monopoly capitalist class. American imperialism is in a predicament of being attacked from both inside and outside, facing unprecedented serious political and economic crises. American imperialism is having a hard time. Under such circumstances, Chairman Mao's great declaration has an immeasurable and profound significance in further promoting the anti-American struggle of all the people of the world and the contemporary world revolutionary movement.

Chairman Mao's great declaration scientifically and profoundly analyzes the contradictions between the American black people and the American ruling class, and deeply reveals the class essence of the American black people's struggle against violence.

Chairman Mao's great declaration is the greatest concern and support for the American black people's struggle against violence and the oppressed and exploited people in the United States. It is the greatest concern and support for all oppressed and exploited nations and peoples in the world.

Chairman Mao's great declaration is a battle mobilization order calling on the American black people, the American people, and all oppressed nations and peoples in the world to unite and launch a sustained and fierce attack on American imperialism and its lackeys.

Chairman Mao's great declaration is the most powerful ideological weapon for the revolutionary people of the world to defeat American imperialism and its lackeys.

Chairman Mao's great declaration is a resounding call to arms to completely smash imperialism, colonialism, and all systems of exploitation, and is a great declaration for the complete liberation of all oppressed peoples and nations in the world.

Chairman Mao's great declaration fully expresses the firm revolutionary will of the 700 million Chinese people to support the American black people's struggle against violence. We, the proletariat of Shanghai, resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call. We must have a broad vision for our country and the world, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and together with the people of the whole country, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and build our great socialist motherland into a strong base for world revolution. Although we are far apart from the American black people, we have common interests and common battle targets. Our hearts are connected. We resolutely stand as their strong rear guard, supporting their struggle against violence. We firmly believe that the powerful revolutionary force of the American black people is invincible. They will, with the support of all revolutionary people of the world, wage a courageous and sustained struggle and achieve complete liberation!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Let all the people of the world unite more closely, launch a sustained and fierce attack on our common enemy, American imperialism, and its lackeys! It can be affirmed that the thorough collapse of colonialism, imperialism, and all systems of exploitation, and the complete liberation of all oppressed peoples and nations in the world, is not far off." Let us unite with all proletarians of the world, unite with all oppressed peoples and nations of the world, shoulder to shoulder, hand in hand, heart to heart, and fight to the end to bury colonialism, imperialism, and all systems of exploitation, and to create a new world of Mao Zedong Thought that is red and radiant.
