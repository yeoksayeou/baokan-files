Chairman Mao's latest instructions open the minds of workers, proletarian sentiments unite red hearts together: Kela Maya oil field achieves revolutionary great alliance

A Xinhua News Agency report from Urumqi, April 6: The workers of various ethnic groups in Kela Maya, an important oil base in our country, are following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and seriously implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Recently, they have successfully achieved a revolutionary great alliance.

After the two factions in the oil field reached an agreement to achieve a revolutionary great alliance, the city of Kela Maya was filled with joy. The oil workers of various ethnic groups, with deep proletarian sentiments of boundless love and respect for the great leader Chairman Mao, held high the portrait of Chairman Mao, beat drums and gongs, and held rallies to celebrate the achievement of the revolutionary great alliance between the two factions and to celebrate the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The shouts of "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!" echoed throughout the oil city. At the celebration rally, the oil workers of various ethnic groups expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, resolutely implement the agreement on the revolutionary great alliance, further consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance, promote the revolutionary tripartite combination, deeply carry out the revolutionary great criticism, better grasp the revolution and promote production, and increase vigilance to prevent the sabotage and disruption by class enemies, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Kela Maya is located at the forefront of anti-revisionism and is an important oil base in our country. In recent years, the revolutionary workers of various ethnic groups here have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and made important contributions in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, as well as in the struggle against revisionism. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have made great achievements in grasping the revolution and promoting production. However, due to the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line and the instigation by a handful of capitalist-roaders and class enemies within the party, the workers in Kela Maya were once split into two factions, with strong antagonistic sentiments. Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions reached Kela Maya, opening the minds of the oil workers. The entire oil field quickly launched a wave of studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Under the strong support and help of the People's Liberation Army, the broad revolutionary workers, with the focus on "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism," established Mao Zedong Thought study classes. So far, more than 13,800 people have participated in the study.

The Mao Zedong Thought study classes in the oil field placed class education as an important lesson. The broad revolutionary workers in the study classes recalled the bitterness of class oppression in the old society and exposed the crimes of the bourgeois reactionary line, further raising their class consciousness and line struggle consciousness. They said, "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions.' In the old society, we were all bitter gourds on the same vine, suffering the same bitterness under the old society. There are no fundamental conflicts of interest between us. Splitting us into two factions and creating estrangement, so that we cannot unite our strengths, is all the trickery of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party led by China's Khrushchev. We must recognize their counter-revolutionary faces, unite, and direct our struggle against these class enemies. We must not let them find any loopholes. Common class sentiments have united the red hearts of the oil workers, all loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao. In the past, some people would always expose each other's wounds and find faults with each other when they met; now, they sit down calmly, repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings, strictly demand of themselves, and do more self-criticism, striving to achieve a revolutionary great alliance. The entire Kela Maya has seen a wave of revolutionary great alliance, with the masses urging the leaders, and the leaders leading the masses, and various mass organizations promoting each other. On March 25, the entire oil field finally achieved the revolutionary great alliance.

After achieving the revolutionary great alliance, the broad revolutionary workers in the oil field have even more enthusiasm for grasping the revolution and promoting production. The two factions in the Kela Maya Power Plant, under the unified arrangement of the Great Alliance Committee of the Power Plant, jointly carried out the revolutionary great criticism, severely criticizing China's Khrushchev and his agents' attempt to restore capitalism; in production, everyone worked together, ensuring the smooth completion of production tasks. In the first quarter of this year, the oil workers in the Kela Maya region overfulfilled the state plans for crude oil, crude oil processing, drilling, and products such as gasoline, kerosene, diesel, and lubricating oil.

### 毛主席最新指示打开工人心窍　无产阶级感情把红心连在一起  克拉玛依油区胜利实现革命大联合

    毛主席最新指示打开工人心窍　无产阶级感情把红心连在一起
    克拉玛依油区胜利实现革命大联合
    新华社乌鲁木齐六日电　我国重要石油基地克拉玛依油区的各族工人，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，大办毛泽东思想学习班，认真落实毛主席的最新指示，在最近胜利实现了革命大联合。
    当油区两派群众组织达成实现革命大联合的协议后，克拉玛依油城一片欢腾。各族石油工人满怀对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限崇敬的深厚无产阶级感情，高举毛主席画像，敲锣打鼓，举行集会，热烈庆祝两派革命群众组织实现革命大联合，热烈欢呼毛主席无产阶级革命路线的又一胜利。“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”的欢呼声响彻石油城。在庆祝集会上，各族石油工人表示，一定要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决贯彻革命大联合的协议，进一步巩固和发展革命的大联合，促进革命的三结合，深入开展革命大批判，更好地抓革命促生产，百倍提高警惕，严防阶级敌人的破坏和捣乱，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    克拉玛依地处反修前哨，又是我国的一个重要石油基地。近几年来，这里的各族革命职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动和反修斗争中作出了重要贡献。在无产阶级文化大革命中，抓革命促生产，做出了很大成绩。但是，由于资产阶级反动路线的影响，以及党内一小撮走资派和阶级敌人的挑拨，克拉玛依职工一度分裂成两派，对立情绪很大。毛主席的一系列最新指示传到克拉玛依，打开了石油工人的心窍，整个油区很快就掀起了一个学习毛主席最新指示的热潮。广大革命职工在人民解放军的大力支持和帮助下，以“斗私，批修”为纲，大办毛泽东思想学习班，到目前为止，已有一万三千八百多人参加了学习。
    油区的毛泽东思想学习班把阶级教育作为重要的一课，广大革命职工在学习班上大忆旧社会阶级压迫的苦，大摆资产阶级反动路线的罪恶，进一步提高了阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟。他们说，毛主席教导我们：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”在旧社会，我们都是一根藤上的苦瓜，同受旧社会的苦，我们之间没有根本的利害冲突。把我们分成两派，产生隔阂，有劲使不到一块，这都是以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派搞的鬼。我们一定要认清他们的反革命嘴脸，联合起来，把斗争矛头对准这些阶级敌人，决不能让他们钻空子。共同的阶级感情，把石油工人一颗颗忠于伟大领袖毛主席的红心连在一起了。过去有些人碰到一块，总是揭对方的疮疤，找别人的岔子；现在，他们冷静地坐下来，反复学习毛主席的教导，严格要求自己，多做自我批评，要求实现革命大联合。整个克拉玛依出现了群众促头头，头头带群众，各群众组织互相促进的革命大联合热潮。三月二十五日，全油区终于实现了革命的大联合。
    实现革命大联合以后，油区广大革命职工抓革命促生产的劲头更足了。克拉玛依电厂两派群众在电厂大联合委员会的统一安排下，一起进行革命的大批判，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人妄图复辟资本主义的罪行；在生产上，大家同心协力，保证了生产任务的顺利完成。今年第一季度，克拉玛依地区石油工人超额完成了原油、原油加工、钻井等任务和汽油、煤油、柴油、润滑油等产品的国家计划。
