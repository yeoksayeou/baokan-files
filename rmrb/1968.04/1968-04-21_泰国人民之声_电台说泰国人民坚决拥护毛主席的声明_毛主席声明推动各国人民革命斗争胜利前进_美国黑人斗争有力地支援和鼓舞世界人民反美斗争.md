	"The Voice of the Thai People" radio station issued a commentary on April 19 stating that Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence has great international significance. This statement is a powerful force driving the victory of the American black struggle and the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries.

	The commentary said that Chairman Mao, in his statement, brilliantly pointed out the correct path for American blacks to achieve thorough liberation, which is to rely on violent revolution to overthrow the reactionary rule of the American monopolistic bourgeoisie and to destroy the system of colonialism and imperialism.

	The commentary said that the unprecedented large-scale struggle of American blacks against violence has dealt a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialism, which is in a state of internal and external difficulties. It has greatly supported and inspired the struggle of the peoples of the world against U.S. imperialism and has powerfully supported the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression for national salvation.

	The commentary pointed out that after Chairman Mao issued the statement "Support the Just Struggle of the American Blacks Against Racial Discrimination by U.S. Imperialism" on August 8, 1963, the struggle of American blacks entered a new stage. Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, American blacks have become more awakened and more courageously conducted their just struggle against racial discrimination by U.S. imperialism. They fear neither violent suppression nor sacrifice, and they continue to fight unyieldingly. They have become a powerful revolutionary force in the struggle of the American people against U.S. imperialism. The commentary said that it can be affirmed that Chairman Mao's statement this time will surely promote the struggle of American blacks against violence to develop on a larger scale and with greater intensity and ferocity.

	The commentary expressed that the Thai people fully support Chairman Mao's statement and call on the Thai people to strengthen their struggle, especially armed struggle, to launch a sustained and fierce offensive against the common enemy, U.S. imperialism, and its lackeys, and to resolutely support the just struggle of American blacks.

	The commentary finally emphasized that Chairman Mao said in the statement: "It can be affirmed that the thorough collapse of colonialism, imperialism, and all exploitative systems, and the thorough liberation of all oppressed peoples and nations in the world, is not far off." This great prophecy will surely be realized.
