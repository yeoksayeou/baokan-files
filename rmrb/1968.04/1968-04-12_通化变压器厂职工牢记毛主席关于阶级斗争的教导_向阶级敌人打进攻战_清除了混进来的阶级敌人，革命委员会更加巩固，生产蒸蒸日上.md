Workers of Tonghua Transformer Factory Remember Chairman Mao's Teachings on Class Struggle
Launch Offensive Against Class Enemies
Class Enemies Eliminated, Revolutionary Committee Further Consolidated, Production Thriving

From our reporter: With the help of the stationed People's Liberation Army, the Revolutionary Committee of Tonghua Transformer Factory in Tonghua City, Jilin Province, has used Chairman Mao's theories on class and class struggle as a weapon, linked these theories to the actual class struggle within the factory, held extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and launched a deep revolutionary criticism campaign. This has led the entire factory's revolutionary workers to launch an offensive against class enemies, making the Revolutionary Committee more consolidated and production thriving. The factory has completed 108% of its first-quarter production tasks one month ahead of schedule.

In January of this year, after the Revolutionary Committee of the Transformer Factory was established, it focused on revolutionary criticism, which promoted the development of various tasks. The factory's revolution and production entered a new phase, and many sister units came to learn from it. At this time, some members of the Revolutionary Committee developed a sense of complacency, thinking that after the "internal war" had been quelled and revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination had been achieved, they could finally relax.

The stationed PLA comrades analyzed this mindset and concluded that the closer the Cultural Revolution gets to complete victory, the more intense and complex the class struggle becomes. The better the situation, the more unwilling class enemies are to accept their defeat, and the more they will struggle desperately. Focusing on class struggle is Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and the fundamental guarantee for fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. If one becomes complacent and does not continue to attack class enemies, one will suffer great losses and be deceived.

Given this situation, the stationed PLA guided everyone to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings: "Class enemies will definitely seek opportunities to reveal themselves." "Class struggle is an objective existence, not subject to the will of man. That is to say, it is inevitable. No matter how much one's will wants to avoid it, it is impossible." This made everyone's minds clear and realize that their previous thoughts were contrary to Chairman Mao's teachings. At this time, the stationed PLA again guided everyone to use Chairman Mao's instructions as a weapon, to thoroughly criticize the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" of China's Khrushchev, to fully expose the sharp class struggle within the factory, and to conduct living class education. There is a historical counter-revolutionary in the factory who, before the revolutionary unity, incited armed struggle and openly declared, "The time for revenge has come." When the revolutionary masses exposed his reactionary nature and resolutely expelled him from the revolutionary organization, this fellow appeared to be more obedient on the surface but secretly used more cunning and deceitful methods, going from door to door, giving gifts, refusing to work, and inciting others not to work, opposing the new Revolutionary Committee. Through mobilizing the masses to fully expose the facts of class struggle, everyone's eyes were opened, and they realized: class enemies are constantly attacking us, and we must never forget class struggle. Revolutionary Committee member Wang Zhaocheng said: "Our Revolutionary Committee was born and grew up in the midst of sharp and complex class struggle. We must never relax in class struggle. If we give up class struggle, we will forget the fundamentals, and the Revolutionary Committee will collapse." Revolutionary Committee member Zhang Mingkui said: "Class struggle has never stopped for a moment. We should be vigilant in times of peace and not complacent. Only by constantly attacking class enemies and not giving them a chance to breathe, can our revolutionary order truly be established."

After the broad revolutionary workers raised their awareness, they consciously used the perspective of class struggle to observe the things around them and actively maintained the purity of the proletarian ranks. There was an old man in the temporary worker team who was always sneaking around, and his way of sweeping the floor did not seem like that of a laborer. After hearing these reports, most members of the Revolutionary Committee thought: we must be vigilant and investigate him. But someone said: this temporary worker has worked for quite some time and should not have any problems. After further exposure and investigation by the masses, it turned out that this fellow was a landlord who had sneaked in during the time when the revolutionary masses were fighting "internal wars." He stirred up trouble everywhere and was very unruly. Facing this situation, the Revolutionary Committee believed: class enemies dare to be so arrogant because of their reactionary nature. Therefore, the leaders of the Revolutionary Committee and the masses studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle together, exposing the reactionary facts of this landlord to the masses, and letting everyone expose and criticize him. In this way, the revolutionary workers of the entire factory had a deeper understanding: the closer the revolution is to complete victory, the more class enemies will grind their teeth. Therefore, we must raise our awareness of class struggle and revolutionary vigilance. Subsequently, the Revolutionary Committee dealt with this landlord who had sneaked in according to policy.

Now, the Revolutionary Committee is holding a study class titled "Never Forget Class Struggle," leading the entire factory to conduct a mass revolutionary criticism campaign, and further eliminating the poisonous influence of China's Khrushchev's "theory of the extinction of class struggle."

The militia and revolutionary masses of Nanning People's Printing Factory in Guangxi, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, fiercely criticized China's Khrushchev's revisionist party line, determined to thoroughly criticize and expose China's Khrushchev, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

### 通化变压器厂职工牢记毛主席关于阶级斗争的教导  向阶级敌人打进攻战  清除了混进来的阶级敌人，革命委员会更加巩固，生产蒸蒸日上

    通化变压器厂职工牢记毛主席关于阶级斗争的教导
    向阶级敌人打进攻战
    清除了混进来的阶级敌人，革命委员会更加巩固，生产蒸蒸日上
    本报讯　吉林省通化市变压器厂革命委员会在驻厂解放军的帮助下，运用毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的理论武器，联系厂里阶级斗争实际，大办毛泽东思想学习班，深入开展革命大批判，带领全厂革命职工向阶级敌人进攻，使革命委员会更加巩固，生产蒸蒸日上，提前一个月完成了第一季度生产任务的百分之一百零八。
    今年一月，变压器厂革命委员会成立以后，狠抓革命的大批判，促进了各项工作的开展。厂里的革命和生产出现了一个新局面，不少兄弟单位来厂“取经”。这时，革命委员会里有的同志滋长了安于现状的思想，认为好不容易才平息了“内战”，实现了革命大联合和革命三结合，可以松一口气了。
    驻厂解放军同志对这种思想进行了分析研究，认为文化大革命越是接近全面胜利，阶级斗争越是尖锐复杂；形势越是大好，阶级敌人越不甘心自己的失败，越要作垂死的挣扎。狠抓阶级斗争是毛主席的伟大战略部署，是全面落实毛主席最新指示的根本保证。如果思想麻痹、安于现状，而不再向阶级敌人进攻，就要吃大亏，上大当。
    根据这种情况，驻厂的解放军引导大家反复学习毛主席的教导：“阶级敌人是一定要寻找机会表现他们自己的。”“阶级斗争是客观存在，不依人的意志为转移的。就是说，不可避免的。人的意志想要避免，也不可能。”使大家的头脑清醒过来，认识到以前那种想法是背离了毛主席的教导。这时，驻厂解放军又引导大家以毛主席的指示为武器，狠揭狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，大摆厂内尖锐的阶级斗争情况，进行活的阶级教育。厂里有一个历史反革命分子，在革命大联合以前，他挑动武斗，公开扬言“报仇的时候到了”。当革命群众识破他的反动本质，坚决地把他清除出革命组织之后，这个家伙表面上装作老实些了，暗地里却用更加阴险狡猾的手段，成天串门送礼，拒不上工，还到处煽动别人不上工，对抗新生的革命委员会。通过发动群众大摆阶级斗争事实，使大家擦亮了眼睛，认识到：阶级敌人时时都在向我们进攻，我们千万不能忘记阶级斗争。革委会领导成员王照臣说：“我们革命委员会就是在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中诞生和成长的。我们决不能放松阶级斗争。放弃了阶级斗争，就忘掉了根本，革命委员会就要垮台。”革委会领导成员张明奎说：“阶级斗争一时一刻也没有停息。我们应该居安思危，不能居安思稳。只有向阶级敌人不停地进攻，不给敌人以喘息之机，我们的革命秩序才能真正确立起来。”
    广大革命职工提高认识后，都自觉地用阶级斗争的眼光观察周围的事物，积极维护无产阶级队伍的纯洁性。厂里临时工队伍里有个老头，整天鬼鬼祟祟，拿扫帚扫地也不象是劳动人民出身的样子。革委会成员听到这些反映以后，多数人认为：要擦亮眼睛，提高警惕，对他进行调查。但有人却说：这个临时工已经工作了不少日子，不会有什么问题吧。经过群众进一步的揭发和调查，原来这个家伙是趁革命群众打“内战”时，混进来的地主分子，他到处煽风点火，极不老实。针对这种情况，革委会认为：阶级敌人胆敢这样嚣张，是他的反动本质决定的。于是革委会的领导成员就和群众一起学习毛主席有关阶级和阶级斗争的教导，把这个地主分子的反动事实摆在群众面前，让大家揭发批判。这样，全厂革命职工更加深刻地认识到：革命越是接近全面胜利的时候，阶级敌人越是会把牙齿咬得格格直响。因此，我们必须提高阶级斗争观念和革命警惕。随后，革委会按照政策，对这个混水摸鱼的地主分子作了严肃处理。
    现在，革命委员会正在开办“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的学习班，带动全厂进行群众性的革命大批判，进一步肃清中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论的流毒。（附图片）
    广西南宁市人民印刷厂的民兵和革命群众，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线，决心把中国赫鲁晓夫彻底批倒批臭，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
