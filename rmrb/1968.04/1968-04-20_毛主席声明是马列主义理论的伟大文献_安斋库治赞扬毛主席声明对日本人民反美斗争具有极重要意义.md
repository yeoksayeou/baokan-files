	Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence is a great document that truly embodies the revolutionary theory of Marxism-Leninism.

	Anzai said that this statement brilliantly expounds on the significance of the black struggle that has erupted in the stronghold of world imperialism—America.

	Anzai said that in this statement, Chairman Mao clearly teaches us: "Currently, the world revolution has entered a great new era." "The thorough collapse of colonialism, imperialism, and all systems of exploitation, and the complete liberation of all oppressed peoples and nations, is not far off." Chairman Mao also puts forward in the statement the proposition that "within the American black community, there lies an extremely powerful revolutionary force." Based on Chairman Mao's teaching, it can be seen that among the laboring people oppressed and exploited under imperialism and all systems of exploitation, including the tens of millions of laboring people in Japan, there lies boundless revolutionary force.

	Anzai continued, Chairman Mao teaches us in the statement: "The struggle of American blacks will inevitably combine with the American workers' movement, ultimately ending the evil rule of the American monopoly capitalist class." Therefore, in Japan, all student struggles and the struggles of the laboring people must also combine with the struggles of the working class. Anzai emphasized that Chairman Mao's statement is of extremely important significance for the Japanese people to arm themselves with revolutionary ideology and launch a sustained and fierce attack against American imperialism and its lackeys.

    安斋库治赞扬毛主席声明对日本人民反美斗争具有极重要意义
    新华社十九日讯　日本革命左派安斋库治十九日向中国记者发表谈话指出，毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明，是一个真正贯串了马克思列宁主义革命理论的伟大文献。
    安斋说，这一声明精辟地阐明了在世界帝国主义的大本营——美国掀起的黑人斗争的意义。
    安斋说，毛主席在这个声明中明确地教导我们：“当前，世界革命进入了一个伟大的新时代。”“殖民主义、帝国主义和一切剥削制度的彻底崩溃，世界上一切被压迫人民、被压迫民族的彻底翻身，已经为期不远了。”毛主席还在声明中提出了在美国黑人中间“蕴藏着极其强大的革命力量”这一论断。根据毛主席的这一教导可以看出，在帝国主义和一切剥削制度下受压迫和剥削的劳动人民中间，包括日本千百万劳动人民中间，蕴藏着无限的革命力量。
    安斋接着说，毛主席在声明中教导我们：“美国黑人斗争必将同美国工人运动相结合，最终结束美国垄断资产阶级的罪恶统治。”因此，在日本，一切学生斗争和劳动人民的斗争，也必须同工人阶级的斗争相结合。安斋强调指出，毛泽东同志的声明，对于日本人民用革命思想武装自己，向美帝国主义及其帮凶们展开持久的猛烈的进攻，具有极为重要的意义。
