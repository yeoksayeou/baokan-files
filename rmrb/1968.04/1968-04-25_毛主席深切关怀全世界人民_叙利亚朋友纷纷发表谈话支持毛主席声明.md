In recent days, the Syrian people have continued to cheer Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence. Many people have expressed to Xinhua News Agency correspondents that they are deeply grateful for Chairman Mao's deep concern for the revolutionary people of the world and wish Chairman Mao longevity.

Syrian friend Zoghabi said, Chairman Mao's statement has pointed out a clear direction for the Arab people and the revolutionary people of the world. Chairman Mao not only deeply cares for the Chinese people but also deeply cares for the people of the world; Chairman Mao's statement is not only a great support for the struggle of American blacks but also a great support for the struggle of the Arab people and the people of the world.

Zoghabi said: "American imperialism is the common enemy of the people of the world and the most ferocious enemy of the Arab people. We will never forget that last June, the one supporting the Zionist aggression of Israel against Arab countries was American imperialism, and now the one continuing to support Israel's military provocations and aggression against Arab countries is still American imperialism."

Syrian friend Usama said: "Chairman Mao pointed out, 'The struggle of American blacks will inevitably combine with the American workers' movement, ultimately ending the evil rule of the American monopolistic bourgeoisie.' Chairman Mao's words have pointed out the direction for American blacks."

Syrian student Mahir said, using revolutionary violence to oppose counter-revolutionary violence is a very important truth.

    毛主席深切关怀全世界人民
    叙利亚朋友纷纷发表谈话支持毛主席声明
    据新华社大马士革二十三日电　最近几天来，叙利亚人民继续欢呼毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明。许多人向新华社记者表示，他们十分感激毛主席对世界革命人民深切的关怀，并祝毛主席万寿无疆。
    叙利亚朋友佐加比说，毛主席的声明给阿拉伯人民和世界其他革命人民指出了明确的方向。毛主席不仅深切关心中国人民，而且也深切关心全世界人民；毛主席的声明不仅是对美国黑人斗争的巨大支持，而且也是对阿拉伯人民和世界人民的斗争的巨大支持。
    佐加比说：“美帝国主义是世界人民的共同敌人，是阿拉伯人民的最凶恶的敌人。我们决不会忘记，去年六月支持以色列犹太复国主义侵略阿拉伯国家的是美帝国主义，现在继续支持以色列对阿拉伯国家进行军事挑衅和侵略的，也还是美帝国主义。”
    叙利亚朋友乌萨马说：“毛主席指出，‘美国黑人斗争必将同美国工人运动相结合，最终结束美国垄断资产阶级的罪恶统治。’毛主席的这句话给美国黑人指出了方向。”
    叙利亚学生马希尔说，用革命的暴力反对反革命的暴力，这是一个非常重要的真理。
