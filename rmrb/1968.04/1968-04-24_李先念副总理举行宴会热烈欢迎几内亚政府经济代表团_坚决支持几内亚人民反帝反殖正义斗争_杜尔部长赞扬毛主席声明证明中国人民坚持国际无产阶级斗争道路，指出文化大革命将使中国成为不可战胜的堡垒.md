More than a thousand revolutionary masses from the capital, holding high banners reading "Long Live the Friendship Between the Peoples of China and Guinea," enthusiastically welcomed the Guinean government economic delegation led by Ismaila Touré, Minister of Economic Development, at the capital airport today. The delegation is visiting China for friendly talks.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Qiao Qinyun, Vice Chairman of the State Economic Commission Xie Huai-de, and responsible officials of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee went to the airport to welcome them.

After stepping off the plane to the sound of gongs and drums, Ismaila Touré and the delegation members warmly shook hands with Vice Premier Li Xiannian and others, expressing their welcome. Red Guards from the capital presented "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to the Guinean friends and read Chairman Mao's teachings: "The just struggles of all the peoples of the world are mutually supportive. The Chinese people regard the victories of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America in their struggles against imperialism as our own victories, and we extend warm sympathy and support to all their anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist struggles."

Subsequently, accompanied by Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Ismaila Touré and others circled the field to meet with the welcoming crowd. The welcoming crowd held high portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao and portraits of President Touré, waving red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and repeatedly shouting slogans such as: "Long Live the Friendship Between the Peoples of China and Guinea!" "Long Live the Unity of the Peoples of Asia and Africa!" "Firmly Support the Revolutionary Struggles of the Peoples of All Countries!" "Down with U.S. Imperialism! Down with Soviet Revisionism!" "Long Live the Invincible Thought of Mao Zedong!" "Long Live the Complete Victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long Live Chairman Mao! Ten Thousand Years!" Some Red Guards stepped out of the welcoming line to pin Mao badges on the chests of the Guinean friends. Diplomatic officials from the Guinean Embassy in China and some diplomats from other countries stationed in China also went to the airport to welcome them.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian held a banquet tonight to warmly welcome the Guinean government economic delegation led by Ismaila Touré.

Before the banquet, Vice Premier Li Xiannian had a friendly talk with Ismaila Touré.

At the banquet, Vice Premier Li Xiannian spoke first. He enthusiastically praised the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Guinea and reiterated China's firm support for the Guinean people's struggle to defend national independence and state sovereignty against imperialism and old and new colonialism. He said that last year, the Eighth National Congress of the Democratic Party of Guinea adopted a resolution on strengthening and developing relations between China and Guinea. This is a vote of confidence in the Chinese people and the Chinese government. We express our heartfelt thanks for this.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian said that on April 16, Chairman Mao issued a statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence. Chairman Mao's solemn statement firmly supports and highly praises the liberation struggle of American blacks. Chairman Mao said in the statement: "The struggle of American blacks is not only a struggle for freedom and liberation by the oppressed and exploited blacks but also a new call to arms for the entire oppressed and exploited American people against the brutal rule of the monopoly capitalist class." Chairman Mao regards the struggle of American blacks against violence as a component of the overall struggle of the peoples of the world against U.S. imperialism. Chairman Mao reaffirmed the wise judgment of 1963: "The evil system of colonialism and imperialism, which rose with the enslavement and trafficking of blacks, will also come to an end with the complete liberation of the black race."

He said that the head of imperialism, U.S. imperialism, is in serious political and economic crises under the heavy blows of the great war of resistance against U.S. aggression and for national salvation by the Vietnamese people, the struggle of American blacks against violence, and the financial and monetary crisis in the capitalist world of the West. As long as the oppressed peoples and nations of the world support and cooperate with each other and launch sustained and fierce attacks on U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, they will surely bury U.S. imperialism more quickly. We are convinced that the day when imperialism and old and new colonialism are completely driven out of the African continent is not far off.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian said that at present, our people are fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the situation throughout the country is excellent. The continuous victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China have greatly inspired all revolutionary peoples in the world and dealt a heavy blow to imperialism led by the United States and reactionaries in various countries. We believe that after the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, socialist China will be even stronger and will be able to better support the African peoples who are in the midst of struggle.

Ismaila Touré said in his speech that we congratulate the Chinese people and the Chinese leadership led by the world proletarian revolutionary leader Chairman Mao on all their achievements in the revolution. We sincerely hope that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China will achieve a comprehensive victory as soon as possible. This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will make China an invincible fortress, enabling China to provide more assistance to developing countries so as to surround and ultimately defeat imperialism and old and new colonialism.

He said that Chairman Mao recently issued a statement on the situation of the struggle of American blacks after the assassination of Martin Luther King, which proves that the Chinese people have effectively adhered to the path of international proletarian struggle. Ismaila Touré pointed out that the struggles of the peoples of all countries are interconnected and indivisible.

He said that the Guinean people continue to fight against imperialism. As long as there are colonies in Africa, as long as there are imperialist troops in Vietnam, as long as imperialist aggression exists, as long as there is racial discrimination in the United States, South Africa, and other places, the Guinean people will continue to fight.

Ismaila Touré said that there is an unbreakable friendship and unity between the Chinese people and the Guinean people and the African people, and we are proud of this. Although imperialism is doing its utmost to obstruct the relations between Guinea and China, the Guinean people know who their enemies are and who their friends are. We will spare no effort to strengthen the friendship and fighting unity between the peoples and governments of Guinea and China.

Guinean Ambassador to China Sékou Kamara and embassy officials were also invited to the banquet.

    新华社二十三日讯　首都革命群众一千多人，今天高举着“中几两国人民友谊万岁”的标语，在首都机场热烈欢迎由几内亚经济发展部部长伊斯梅尔·杜尔率领的几内亚政府经济代表团前来我国进行友好访问。
    国务院副总理李先念，外交部副部长姬鹏飞，对外经委副主任谢怀德，以及北京市革命委员会的负责人，前往机场迎接。
    伊斯梅尔·杜尔部长和代表团成员在锣鼓声中走下飞机以后，李先念副总理等同他们热烈握手，表示欢迎。首都红卫兵小将向几内亚朋友赠送了《毛主席语录》，并朗读毛主席的教导：“全世界各国人民的正义斗争，都是互相支持的。”“中国人民把亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的反帝国主义斗争的胜利看作是自己的胜利，并对他们的一切反帝国主义、反殖民主义的斗争给以热烈的同情和支持。”随后，伊斯梅尔·杜尔部长等由李先念副总理陪同，绕场一周，同欢迎群众见面。欢迎群众高举我们伟大领袖毛主席的像，举着杜尔总统的像，挥动着红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，不断地高呼：“中几两国人民的友谊万岁！”“亚非人民团结万岁！”“坚决支持世界各国人民的革命斗争！”“打倒美帝！打倒苏修！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”一些红卫兵小将走出欢迎行列，把毛主席像章佩戴在几内亚朋友们的胸前。几内亚驻中国大使馆的外交官员和一些国家驻中国的使节，也到机场迎接。
    新华社二十三日讯　国务院副总理李先念今晚举行宴会，热烈欢迎由伊斯梅尔·杜尔部长率领的几内亚政府经济代表团。
    宴会之前，李先念副总理同伊斯梅尔·杜尔部长，在友好的气氛中进行了会谈。
    李先念副总理在宴会上首先讲话。他热烈赞扬了中几两国人民的战斗友谊，并且重申中国人民坚决支持几内亚人民为保卫民族独立和保卫国家主权，同帝国主义、新老殖民主义所进行的正义斗争。他说，去年，几内亚民主党
  “八大”会议通过了关于加强和发展中几两国关系的决议。这是对中国人民和中国政府的信任。我们对此表示衷心的感谢。
    李先念副总理说，毛主席在四月十六日发表了支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明。毛主席的这个庄严声明，对美国黑人的解放斗争表示了坚决的支持，给予了很高的评价。毛主席在声明中说：“美国黑人的斗争，不仅是被剥削、被压迫的黑人争取自由解放的斗争，而且是整个被剥削、被压迫的美国人民反对垄断资产阶级残暴统治的新号角。”毛主席把美国黑人的抗暴斗争，看成是全世界人民反对美帝国主义的总斗争的一个组成部分。毛主席重申一九六三年的英明论断：“万恶的殖民主义、帝国主义制度是随着奴役和贩卖黑人而兴盛起来的，它也必将随着黑色人种的彻底解放而告终。”
    他说，帝国主义的头子美帝国主义，在越南人民伟大的抗美救国战争、美国黑人的抗暴斗争和西方资本主义世界的财政金融危机的沉重打击下，已经陷入了严重的政治危机和经济危机之中。只要全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族互相支持，互相配合，向着美帝国主义及其帮凶们发动持久的猛烈的进攻，就一定能够更快地把美帝国主义埋葬。我们深信，帝国主义和新老殖民主义从非洲大陆全部被赶出去的日子，也已经不远了。
    李先念副总理说，当前，我国人民正在全面落实毛主席的最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，全国是一片大好形势。我国无产阶级文化大革命的节节胜利，给世界上一切革命人民以极大的鼓舞，给以美国为首的帝国主义和各国反动派以沉重的打击。我们相信，经过无产阶级文化大革命，社会主义中国将更加强大，将能更好地给予正在斗争中的非洲人民以支援。
    伊斯梅尔·杜尔部长在讲话中说，我们祝贺中国人民和以世界无产阶级革命领袖毛主席为首的中国领导人，在革命中取得的一切成就。我们衷心希望中国文化大革命迅速取得全面胜利，这次文化大革命将使中国成为不可战胜的堡垒，使中国能够给予正在发展中的国家以更多的援助，以便包围和最后打倒帝国主义和新老殖民主义。
    他说，毛泽东主席最近就马丁·路德·金被残杀以后出现的美国黑人斗争形势发表了声明，这证明中国人民有效地坚持了国际无产阶级斗争的道路。伊斯梅尔·杜尔部长指出，世界各国人民的斗争都是互相联系的，不可分的。
    他说，几内亚人民继续为反对帝国主义而斗争。只要非洲还有殖民地存在，只要越南还有帝国主义的侵略军队存在，只要帝国主义的侵略存在，只要在美国、南非和其他地方还有种族隔离存在，几内亚人民就要继续战斗下去。
    伊斯梅尔·杜尔部长说，中国人民同几内亚人民和非洲人民之间，存在着牢不可破的友谊和团结，我们为此感到骄傲。尽管帝国主义竭力阻止几内亚同中国保持关系，但是几内亚人民知道谁是他们的敌人，谁是他们的朋友。我们将不遗余力地为加强几中两国人民和两国政府之间的友谊和战斗团结而努力。
    几内亚驻中国大使塞古·卡马拉和使馆官员，应邀出席了宴会。
