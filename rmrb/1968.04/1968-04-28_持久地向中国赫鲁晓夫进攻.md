The biggest political task at present is to use Mao Zedong Thought to criticize the bourgeoisie. The fundamental purpose of the Cultural Revolution is to uproot the roots of revisionism, to firmly establish Mao Zedong Thought, and to turn the entire country into a vast school of Mao Zedong Thought, ensuring that our country remains red for generations to come. To achieve this goal, it is not enough to just expose a handful of traitors, spies, die-hard capitalist roaders, and unrepentant landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. We must also politically, ideologically, and theoretically criticize and expose them, so that they can be thoroughly defeated. Otherwise, there will be endless troubles, and the rights of the people may be lost.

To carry out a thorough revolutionary criticism is a powerful attack and counterattack against the class enemies' plot to restore the old order. It is a sharp weapon to thoroughly repel the rightist reversal wind and make the class enemies' plot to overthrow the red political power completely fail. Where the revolutionary criticism is well done, the red political power is consolidated.

To carry out a thorough revolutionary criticism will promote revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination. Where the revolutionary criticism is well done, the spearhead is aimed at the class enemies, and the revolutionary masses are united. Conversely, there will be endless internal strife, and revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination will not be realized.

To carry out a thorough revolutionary criticism will promote the revolutionization of people's thinking. The revolution and production will be carried out with great enthusiasm and solidly.

The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the only weapon to carry out a thorough revolutionary criticism. We must arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought and use Mao Zedong Thought to measure and analyze everything, in order to carry out a thorough revolutionary criticism. With Mao Zedong Thought, we can be invincible. Without Mao Zedong Thought, we will be at a loss.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the broad revolutionary masses led by it and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." We must remember this teaching and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. We must not relax our fighting will. The revolutionary masses of the proletariat, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres must take action, using various methods to carry out revolutionary criticism, and launch a persistent and fierce attack on the Chinese Khrushchev and their agents in various places. We will not stop until we achieve complete victory.

    持久地向中国赫鲁晓夫进攻
    当前最大的政治就是用毛泽东思想批判资产阶级。文化大革命的根本目的就是要挖掉修正主义祸根，大立毛泽东思想，把全国办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校，保证我们国家千秋万代不变色。要达到这个目的，仅仅是把一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派和没有改造好的地富反坏右分子揪出来是不够的，还要从政治上、思想上、理论上把他们批倒、批臭。只有这样，才能把他们彻底打倒。否则，就会后患无穷，人民得到的权利就可能丧失。
    抓好革命大批判，是对阶级敌人复辟阴谋的有力进攻和反击，是彻底击退右倾翻案妖风，使阶级敌人颠覆红色政权的阴谋彻底破产的锐利武器。那里革命大批判搞得好，红色政权就巩固。
    抓好革命大批判，就能促进革命的大联合和革命的三结合。那里革命大批判抓得好，矛头对准了阶级敌人，革命派就团结得紧。反之，就会“内战”连绵，革命大联合和革命三结合迟迟不能实现。
    抓好革命大批判，就会促进人的思想革命化。革命和生产就搞得热气腾腾，扎扎实实。
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想是搞好革命大批判的唯一的武器。我们只有用毛泽东思想武装自己，用毛泽东思想去衡量一切、分析一切，才能搞好革命大批判。有了毛泽东思想，我们就能无往而不胜，离开了毛泽东思想，我们就寸步难行。
    毛主席指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”我们必须牢记这一教导，照毛主席的指示办事，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。绝不可松懈我们的战斗意志。无产阶级革命派、革命群众和革命干部行动起来，采用各种方式开展革命大批判，向中国赫鲁晓夫以及他们在各地的代理人发起持久的、猛烈的进攻。不获全胜，决不收兵。　《湖北日报》
