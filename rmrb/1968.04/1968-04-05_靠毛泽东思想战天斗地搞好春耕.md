Revolutionary cadres and community members of Longwo Commune's Paillou Brigade in Zijing County, Guangdong, have held extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes during the spring ploughing season. They actively learn from and apply Chairman Mao's works, break down the "selfish" mindset, and establish the "public" spirit. They have swept away the idea of "relying on the weather for spring ploughing," and have shown tremendous revolutionary enthusiasm. They have overcome nearly a month of adverse weather conditions, and their spring ploughing work has been done quickly and well.

According to a report from our newspaper, Longwo Brigade of Zijing County, Guangdong, has held extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes during the spring ploughing season and has carried out a thorough ideological revolution among the people. Relying on the immense power of Mao Zedong Thought, they have broken down the "selfish" mindset and established the "public" spirit. They have fought against the elements and, with a revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," have made the spring ploughing season a roaring success.

This year, as soon as spring arrived, Paillou Brigade encountered continuous spring rains, and the temperature remained low, severely affecting the progress of spring ploughing. Some community members said, "If the weather doesn't warm up, it's hard to get anything done." Under the influence of this "relying on the weather for spring ploughing" mindset, spring ploughing work was slow to start.

To do a good job in spring ploughing, there are only two paths: one is to rely on the weather, but the weather continues to be cold, making it impossible to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions to "grasp revolution and promote production." This path is not reliable. The other path is to rely on Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle and to rely on people who understand Mao Zedong Thought to overcome nature. Only in this way can we find a way forward in adverse weather conditions and make the spring ploughing season a roaring success. This is the only correct path. Through analysis, the cadres and community members of Paillou Brigade deeply felt that the question of "what to rely on for a good spring ploughing season" is not just a general issue, but a major issue of loyalty to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought.

After raising their awareness, Paillou Brigade took "what to rely on for a good spring ploughing season" as the central topic and held extensive study classes. They used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to educate the cadres and community members, turning the spring ploughing season into a political struggle to uphold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and to criticize and repudiate selfishness and revisionism. The study classes began with learning Chairman Mao's latest instructions and discussing the excellent situation of the nationwide Cultural Revolution. Then, they guided the students to identify the current production problems in the brigade.

To further instill in the cadres and community members the firm belief of "not relying on the weather, not relying on the land, but relying on Mao Zedong Thought to do a good job in spring ploughing," the study classes put forward the slogan: "Be loyal to Chairman Mao, emphasize the use of Chairman Mao's books, take 'The Three Constantly Read Articles' as a motto, break down selfishness and establish public spirit for spring ploughing." The leading cadres of the brigade all participated in the study classes, learning together with the community members and production team cadres, setting an example, and taking the lead in breaking down selfishness and establishing public spirit. Huang Naiqun, the captain of the militia, said after studying "The Three Constantly Read Articles" and related quotations from Chairman Mao: "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'At present, it is the spring ploughing season. I hope that all leaders, cadres, and people in the liberated areas will seize the opportunity to grasp the key links in production and achieve even greater results than last year.' However, in the previous period, I emphasized the cold weather and the difficulty of work, actually wanting to go out and engage in sideline businesses, not wanting to be a cadre. Comparing myself to Zhang Thiede and Norman Bethune, I am truly ashamed. Upon reflection, it is not that the weather is cold, but that my heart has grown cold towards the revolutionary cause. This is the work of selfishness, a lack of loyalty to Chairman Mao."

Under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought and the influence of the revolutionary leading cadres of the brigade, the students deeply felt that the root of "relying on the weather for spring ploughing" is selfishness. They realized that with selfishness, there can be no public spirit, and with selfishness, there can be no unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao. This aroused their hatred for selfishness, and they voluntarily exposed and criticized their own selfishness. Luo Guifang, a poor peasant woman from Songpai Production Team, said: "Chairman Mao teaches us to learn from Norman Bethune's spirit of 'selflessness and altruism.' But in the previous period, due to the work of selfishness, I did not pay enough attention to the collective. When the production team held meetings and assigned work, I said it was too cold and did not participate, but when I went to my private plot, I was not afraid of the wind or rain. My vegetables grew well, and I applied plenty of fertilizer. If I continue like this, am I not going against Chairman Mao's teachings?" After the study, she hated selfishness and immediately turned over all the fertilizer she had prepared for her private plot to the production team. Huang Changqi, the new production team leader, also said excitedly: "Previously, I said it was too cold to work and did not soak the seeds, actually wanting to do more private work. Now I realize that only when my heart is warm towards the collective will the cold weather not bother me; if my heart is warm towards selfishness, the weather will be cold and my heart will be cold too." After the study, he braved the cold to soak the seeds. To promote germination, he added heat and cover every night, carefully managing the seeds to ensure they sprouted healthily. After sowing the seeds, they encountered severe cold and frost, and he led the community members to the seedling fields at night to protect them from the cold. Under their careful care, the seedlings grew lush and green. After the brigade discovered these moving examples, they promptly summarized the experience and promoted it in the study classes. They also organized on-site reporting meetings, moving the study classes from the house to the fields, giving the participating cadres and community members a profound and vivid education.

After holding extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, militia, revolutionary leading cadres, and community members of Paillou Brigade have mastered the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, broken down selfishness, swept away the idea of "relying on the weather for spring ploughing," and shown tremendous revolutionary enthusiasm. They have made a big splash in the spring ploughing season. The Songpai Production Team was severely short of fertilizer. After the study, men, women, and children all went out, braving the biting cold and rain to work for two days, digging more than four thousand loads of pond mud. Then, they collected more than seven thousand loads of soil and miscellaneous fertilizer, solving the problem of fertilizer shortage. The Xinsheng Production Team lacked people to use the oxen, affecting the work in the fields. Female Communist Party member Zhong Zhaomei dared to think and act, leading the female community members to learn how to use the oxen in the fields. The Buxin Production Team had more than eight acres of hanging ridge fields without water for sowing. The community members shouted "Determine to fight, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory" while carrying water to the fields, sowing the seeds on time. The leading cadre team of Henghu Production Team had not been established, and production was not being managed. Old poor peasant Huang Guofeng, with an unyielding red heart of loyalty to the great teacher Chairman Mao, stepped forward, vigorously supporting the work of new cadres while mobilizing the community members to reorganize and catch up. Countless examples prove that people armed with Mao Zedong Thought have the greatest fighting power. Although this year's spring season encountered nearly a month of adverse weather, all sixteen production teams of Paillou Brigade sowed seeds on time and accumulated more than thirty-four thousand loads of soil and miscellaneous fertilizer. The spring ploughing work was done quickly and well, and everywhere was a scene of revolutionary production in full swing.

    靠毛泽东思想战天斗地搞好春耕
    广东紫金县龙窝公社排楼大队革命干部和社员群众，在春耕生产中大办毛泽东思想学习班，活学活用毛主席著作，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，扫除“靠天时搞春耕”的思想，焕发出冲天革命干劲，战胜近一个月的恶劣气候，春耕工作做得又快又好
    本报讯　广东紫金县龙窝公社排楼大队，在春耕生产中大办毛泽东思想学习班，大搞人的思想革命化。依靠毛泽东思想的无比威力，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，战天斗地，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神把春耕生产搞得热火朝天。
    今年一开春，排楼大队就遇到了连绵不断的春雨，气温一直很低，严重影响春耕生产的展开。有的社员说：“老天不转暖，想干也无法”。就在这种“靠天时搞春耕”的思想影响下，春耕生产迟迟动不起来。
    搞好春耕靠什么？摆在面前的只有两条路：一条是靠天，但天还在继续冷下去，这样就无法落实毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的最新指示。这一条是靠不得的。另一条是靠毛泽东思想挂帅，靠掌握着毛泽东思想的人去战胜大自然。只有这样，才能在天气恶劣的情况下冲出一条路，把春耕生产轰轰烈烈搞起来。这是唯一正确的道路。通过分析，排楼大队的干部、社员深深地感到“搞好春耕靠什么”不是一般的问题，而是忠不忠于毛主席和毛泽东思想的大问题。
    认识提高以后，排楼大队就以“搞好春耕靠什么”为中心议题，大办学习班，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想教育广大干部和社员，把战天斗地闹春耕变成一场高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，斗私批修的政治斗争。学习班从学习毛主席的最新指示入手，畅谈全国无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，然后引导学员找出本大队当前生产中的问题。
    为了使干部和社员进一步树立“不靠天，不靠地，靠毛泽东思想搞好春耕”的坚强信念，学习班提出了“对毛主席要心怀一个‘忠’字，读毛主席的书要突出一个‘用’字，要以‘老三篇’为座右铭，破私立公闹春耕”的口号。大队领导班子的干部全部深入到学习班，和社员、生产队干部一起学习，以身作则，带头破私立公。民兵营长黄乃均通过学习“老三篇”和有关毛主席语录以后说：“毛主席教导我们：‘目前正当春耕时节，希望一切解放区的领导同志、工作人员、人民群众，不失时机地掌握生产环节，取得比去年更大的成绩。’可是前段我却强调天冷难做工作，其实是想出门搞副业，不想当干部，对照张思德、白求恩，真是万分惭愧。检查起来，不是天冷了，而是自己对革命事业的心冷了。这是私字作怪，是对毛主席的不忠。”
    学员们在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在大队革命领导干部的带动和影响下，深深体会到“靠天时搞春耕”的根源就是私字。他们认识到，有了“私”就不能有“公”，有了“私”就不能对毛主席有无限的“忠”，从而激起了对“私”字的愤恨，纷纷自觉亮私、斗私。松排生产队贫农女社员罗桂花说：“毛主席教导我们要学习白求恩同志‘毫不利己专门利人’的精神。但我前段由于私字作怪，对集体不够关心。生产队开会和派工，我都说天冷，不去参加，可是上自留地既不怕风，又不怕雨，自己的菜种得好，肥料也下得足。这样下去，不是违背了毛主席的教导吗？”学习以后，她恨透了私字，立即把自己准备上自留地的家肥全部交售给生产队。新年生产队长黄昌其也激动地说：“以前我说天冷难出勤，谷种也不浸，实际我是想多干点私人活。现在我体会到，只有对集体的心热了，天冷才不会冷；如果对私字热了，天不冷心也冷。”学习后，他冒着天寒浸了种子。为了给种子催芽，每天晚上他都加温加盖，认真管理，使种子健康地萌发起来。把种子播下去以后，又遇到严寒霜冻，他星夜带领社员到秧田防寒。在他们精心护理下，秧苗终于嫩葱葱地生长起来。大队发现这些动人的事例以后，及时总结经验，在学习班中推广，同时还组织了现场讲用会，把学习班由屋里搬到田头，使参加学习的干部和社员受到了深刻、生动的教育。
    排楼大队大办毛泽东思想学习班以后，广大贫下中农、民兵、革命领导干部和社员群众掌握了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，大破“私”字，扫除了“靠天时搞春耕”的思想，焕发出冲天的革命干劲，大闹春耕生产。松排生产队严重缺肥，经过学习后，男女老少一齐出动，冒着凛冽的寒风和细雨奋战两天，挖了四千多担塘泥。接着，又积了七千多担土杂肥，解决了缺肥问题。新年生产队缺少人使牛，影响办田，女共产党员钟招妹敢想敢干，带领女社员下地学会了使牛。布心生产队有八亩多吊岗田的秧地无水播种，社员们一面高喊“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，一面挑水办秧地，把种子及时播了下去。横湖生产队领导班子迟迟没有建起来，生产没人抓。老贫农黄国锋怀着对伟大导师毛主席无限忠诚的一颗红心，挺身而出，一面大力支持新干部工作，一面发动社员群众重整旗鼓，迎头赶上。无数的事实证明，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人具有最大的战斗力。今年开春虽然遇到了连续将近一个月的恶劣气候，但排楼大队十六个生产队都不违农时地播下了种子，并增积了三万四千多担土杂肥，春耕工作做得又快又好，到处是一片热气腾腾的革命生产景象。
