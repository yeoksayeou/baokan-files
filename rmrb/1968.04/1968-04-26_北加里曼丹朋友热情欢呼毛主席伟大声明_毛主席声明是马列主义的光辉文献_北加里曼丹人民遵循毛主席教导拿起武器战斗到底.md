	New China News Agency, April 25th

	Friends from North Kalimantan, Wen Mingquan, warmly hails Chairman Mao's support for the struggle of American blacks against violence. He said: "Chairman Mao's statement is a brilliant historical document of Marxism-Leninism, representing the common voice of all the people of the world who demand liberation."

	Wen Mingquan said: "This statement is a beacon for the struggle of American blacks, a beacon for the struggle of all peoples of the world against colonialism and imperialism, and a proclamation calling on all peoples of the world to completely eliminate our common enemy, American imperialism, and its accomplices."

	Wen Mingquan pointed out: "The murder of the non-violent advocate Martin Luther King by American imperialists once again proves the correctness of Chairman Mao's teaching: 'The central task and highest form of revolution is armed seizure of power, solving problems through war.' American imperialists talk about 'freedom' and 'equality,' but they wield the butcher's knife. The counter-revolutionary tactics of American imperialists can no longer frighten or deceive the awakened black brothers. Today, the volcanic lava hidden beneath the surface has begun to erupt, and American imperialists are being burned to a crisp."

	Wen Mingquan said: "The struggle of the people of North Kalimantan is also proving the truth that only war can solve problems. We have taken up arms, and we will fight to the end."

	He said: "Chairman Mao pointed out: 'The struggle of American blacks will inevitably combine with the American workers' movement,' which is the new direction for the development of the struggle of American blacks. Chairman Mao has pointed out the direction for the struggle of American blacks and also pointed out the path to victory for the liberation of the broad masses of white laborers in America. American blacks and the broad masses of white laborers, advancing along this direction and path, will deal a fatal blow to the brutal rule of the American monopoly capitalists, ultimately leading to their downfall."

	Wen Mingquan concluded passionately: "Today, the world has entered an era where Mao Zedong Thought is the great banner. All peoples of the world will unite under the invincible guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, launching a sustained and fierce attack on our common enemy, American imperialism, and its accomplices! We firmly believe that the world will develop according to Chairman Mao's prophecy: 'The thorough collapse of colonialism, imperialism, and all systems of exploitation, and the thorough liberation of all oppressed peoples and nations, is not far off.'"

    北加里曼丹朋友热情欢呼毛主席伟大声明
    毛主席声明是马列主义的光辉文献
    北加里曼丹人民遵循毛主席教导拿起武器战斗到底
    新华社二十五日讯　北加里曼丹朋友文铭权热烈欢呼毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明。他说：毛主席的声明“是一个马克思列宁主义的光辉的历史文献”，“代表了全世界要求解放的人民的共同声音”。
    文铭权说：这个声明“是为美国黑人斗争导航的灯塔，是为全世界人民反对殖民主义和帝国主义斗争导航的灯塔”，“是号召全世界人民彻底消灭我们的共同敌人美帝国主义及其帮凶的檄文。”
    文铭权指出：非暴力主义者马丁·路德·金被美帝国主义者杀害，再一次证明了毛主席的教导：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题”的正确性。美帝国主义者口里念的是什么“自由”和“平等”，手里拿的却是杀人的屠刀。美帝国主义者的反革命两手已吓不到骗不了觉醒了的黑人兄弟了，今天蕴藏在地下的火山岩浆已经开始喷发，美帝国主义者正在被烧得焦头烂额。
    文铭权说：“北加里曼丹人民的斗争也正在证明只有战争才能解决问题这一真理。我们已经拿起了武器，我们将打到底。”
    他说：“毛主席指出：‘美国黑人斗争必将同美国工人运动相结合’，这是美国黑人斗争发展的新方向。毛主席给美国黑人斗争指出了前进的方向，也给美国广大白人劳动群众指出了争取解放的胜利道路。美国黑人和广大白人劳动群众沿着这个方向和道路前进，美国垄断资产阶级的残暴统治必将受到致命的打击，最后走向灭亡。”
    文铭权最后满怀激情地说：“今天，世界已经进入了以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的时代，全世界人民必将在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的指引下团结起来，向着我们的共同敌人美帝国主义及其帮凶们发动持久的猛烈的进攻！我们坚信，世界一定按照毛泽东主席的预言发展：‘殖民主义、帝国主义和一切剥削制度的彻底崩溃，世界上一切被压迫人民、被压迫民族的彻底翻身，已经为期不远了。’”
