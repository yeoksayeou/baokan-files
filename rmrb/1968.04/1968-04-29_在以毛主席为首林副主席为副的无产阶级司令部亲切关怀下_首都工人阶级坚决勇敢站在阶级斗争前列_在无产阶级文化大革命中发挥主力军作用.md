Under the close care of the Proletarian Headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, the proletariat of the capital bravely stands at the forefront of class struggle and plays a leading role in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Broad revolutionary workers resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Revolutionary great unity is increasingly consolidated, revolutionary three-in-one combination is continuously developed, and revolutionary great criticism is becoming more extensive and profound. The military and the people are united as one, resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," and effectively promoting production.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 28th, the broad revolutionary workers on the industrial, transportation, and urban construction fronts in the capital, who are fighting under the great leadership of Chairman Mao, have, with the enthusiastic help of the People's Liberation Army, raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and comprehensively implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions. In the current struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they resolutely oppose right opportunism, right capitulationism, and right conservatism, launching a fierce attack on the enemies of the proletariat, further playing the role of the main force in the revolutionary struggle in the capital. This is an important sign that the current revolutionary situation in the capital is excellent and getting better and better.

The most fundamental manifestation of the excellent situation on the industrial, transportation, and urban construction fronts in the capital is that the invincible Mao Zedong Thought has been widely popularized to an unprecedented extent. Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions have been quickly implemented in factories, workshops, mines, and construction sites. Mao Zedong Thought study classes are becoming more and more numerous and better and better. The entire industrial, transportation, and urban construction system has held more than 7,000 study classes, with more than 80% of revolutionary workers participating in the study. They carry forward the revolutionary study style personally advocated by Chairman Mao, which combines theory with practice, take the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines as the key, and take the "Three Old Articles" as their motto, setting up battlefields for criticizing and repudiating selfishness and revisionism everywhere. In the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, revolutionary great unity is increasingly consolidated, and revolutionary three-in-one combination is continuously developed. At present, more than 95% of the large and medium-sized factories and enterprises in the industrial, transportation, and urban construction system have established revolutionary committees. The newly born revolutionary committees immediately show strong vitality. They lead the broad revolutionary workers to launch a more fierce attack on the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the anti-revisionist counter-revolutionary clique of the former Beijing Municipal Committee led by Peng Zhen, and to carry out more extensive and profound revolutionary great criticism and struggle-criticism-transformation within their units. Broad revolutionary workers resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," resolutely smash counter-revolutionary economism, resolutely oppose the reactionary trend of anarchism, and effectively promote production. Many factories not only over-fulfilled the state production plan but also achieved many new achievements in production and technological innovation. Since this year, industrial production in the capital has been steadily rising.

The excellent situation on the industrial, transportation, and urban construction fronts in the capital has been achieved under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the close care of the Proletarian Headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. The proletariat of the capital is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. After each of Chairman Mao's latest instructions is issued, they immediately study it seriously, understand it deeply, and implement it resolutely, consciously turning Chairman Mao's great instructions into their actions, and playing the role of the main force in the great struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the broad revolutionary people under its leadership and the Kuomintang reactionaries. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Chairman Mao's brilliant instruction has given the broad revolutionary workers on the industrial, transportation, and urban construction fronts in the capital an extremely powerful ideological weapon. They most resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great battle cry, taking the initiative to launch a fierce attack on the enemies of the proletariat. They stand at the forefront of class struggle, fighting the enemies most bravely, most resolutely, and most richly with the spirit of thorough proletarian revolution.

At present, the industrial, transportation, and urban construction fronts in the capital are launching a more extensive and profound "people's war" of revolutionary great criticism. Broad revolutionary workers, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, are fighting against the handful of unrepentant capitalist roaders, traitors, and spies led by China's Khrushchev, cleansing their counter-revolutionary revisionist poison in all fields. In the Beijing Mining Bureau's Mu Cheng Jian Coal Mine, everywhere is a battlefield for fiercely criticizing China's Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and their agents in industrial and mining enterprises. Revolutionary workers, revolutionary cadres, retired old workers, and revolutionary workers' family members have all joined the ranks of the revolutionary great criticism. In the revolutionary great criticism, broad revolutionary workers study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, and their class struggle consciousness and line struggle awareness have greatly increased. They remember Chairman Mao's teaching to "be good at distinguishing those who disguise themselves as supporters of the revolution but actually oppose the revolution," resolutely expose counter-revolutionary conspirators, ambitious plotters, and two-faced people, resolutely root out the handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and all counter-revolutionary elements who have infiltrated the revolutionary ranks, fight them down and expose them, further consolidating and strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat, consolidating and strengthening the revolutionary committees, consolidating and developing revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, further developing the unprecedentedly excellent revolutionary situation.

The closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution gets to comprehensive victory, the more the counter-revolutionary forces will fight to the death with the revolutionary forces. When a handful of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist roaders stir up the wind of reversing cases, the proletariat of the capital stands firm. They follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, resolutely strike down the counter-revolutionary wind of reversing cases, resolutely oppose right opportunism, right capitulationism, and right conservatism, and thoroughly smash the new counterattack of the enemies of the proletariat.

Our great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "The basic experience of the revolutionary committees has three points: one is to have representatives of revolutionary cadres, one is to have representatives of the military, and one is to have representatives of revolutionary masses, realizing the three-in-one combination of the revolution. The revolutionary committees should implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative organs, streamline administration, and organize a revolutionary leadership cadre that is connected with the masses."

The broad revolutionary workers in the capital seriously study, deeply understand, and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the revolutionary committees. They realize that Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions are the fundamental direction and fundamental guideline for the construction of revolutionary committees and must be studied and applied to build revolutionary committees into a revolutionary leadership cadre that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, connected with the masses. The revolutionary committee of the Beijing Knitting General Factory, with the enthusiastic help of the support-left personnel of the 8341st Unit, places the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and more important than everything, and firmly walks the road of emphasizing proletarian politics. The members of the revolutionary committee and the broad revolutionary workers together insist on reading Chairman Mao's books every day, consulting Chairman Mao's works when encountering problems, holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and firmly grasping class struggle, continuously improving the level of criticizing and repudiating selfishness and revisionism, making the revolutionary committee advance vigorously on the road of being extremely proletarian and extremely militant.

The members of various revolutionary committees deeply feel that whether the revolutionary committee can grasp power and use power according to the principles of proletarian party nature is a major test of loyalty to Chairman Mao. Therefore, they are even more conscious of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, further strengthening their proletarian party nature, opposing bourgeois factionalism, and wholeheartedly serving the people.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without a people's army, there will be nothing for the people." The broad revolutionary workers on the industrial, transportation, and urban construction fronts in the capital love the People's Liberation Army the most and support it the most. They have profound proletarian feelings for the unique-in-the-world people's army personally created and led by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin. They unshakably "believe in and rely on the People's Liberation Army." When a handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and counter-revolutionary elements maliciously direct their spears at the People's Liberation Army, attempting to sabotage the "three supports, two militaries" work and sow discord between the military and the people, the proletariat of the capital stands up, resolutely exposes and thoroughly smashes the enemy's plots. Broad revolutionary workers believe that "believing in and relying on the People's Liberation Army" is an important part of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Whether to believe in and rely on the Liberation Army is a major principle of whether to be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, a major principle of distinguishing between true revolutionaries and false revolutionaries.

Our great leader Chairman Mao's great instructions on the three-in-one combination have raised the unity between the military and the people to an unprecedented new height, pushing the "support the army and love the people" movement to a new stage. The military and the people are united as one, forming an iron wall to defend the dictatorship of the proletariat.

    在以毛主席为首林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部亲切关怀下
    首都工人阶级坚决勇敢站在阶级斗争前列  在无产阶级文化大革命中发挥主力军作用
    广大革命职工坚决落实毛主席最新指示，革命大联合日益巩固，革命三结合不断发展，革命大批判更加广泛深入；军民团结一致，最坚决地执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，有力地促进了生产
    据新华社二十八日讯　战斗在伟大领袖毛主席身边的首都工业、交通、城市建设战线的广大革命职工，在人民解放军热情帮助下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，在当前夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的斗争中，坚决反对右倾分裂主义，右倾投降主义，右倾保守主义，向无产阶级的敌人发动猛烈进攻，进一步发挥了左右首都革命斗争形势的主力军作用。这是当前首都革命形势一片大好、越来越好的重要标志。
    首都工交城建战线大好形势最根本的表现，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想得到了空前的大普及，毛主席的一系列最新指示，在工厂、车场、矿山、工地上迅速落实。毛泽东思想学习班越办越多，越办越好，整个工交城建系统已办学习班七千多期，百分之八十以上的革命职工参加了学习。他们发扬毛主席亲自倡导的理论联系实际的革命学风，以两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争为纲，以“老三篇”为座右铭，到处摆开斗私批修的战场。在活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动中，革命的大联合日益巩固，革命的三结合不断发展。现在工交城建系统大中型工厂企业中，百分之九十五以上的单位都建立了革命委员会。新诞生的革命委员会立即显示了强大的生命力，它率领广大革命职工，向中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派和旧北京市委彭真反革命修正主义集团展开更加猛烈的进攻，更加广泛、深入地开展革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改。广大革命职工坚决执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，坚决粉碎反革命经济主义，坚决反对无政府主义的反动思潮，有力地促进了生产。许多工厂不仅超额完成了国家生产计划，而且在生产技术革新方面，也有许多新的成就。今年以来，首都工业生产稳步上升。
    首都工交城建战线的一片大好形势，是在毛主席最新指示的指引下，在以毛主席为首、林彪副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的亲切关怀下取得的。首都工人阶级无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。毛主席的每一项最新指示下达后，他们都立即认真学习，深刻领会，坚决落实，自觉地把毛主席的伟大指示化为自己的行动，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中，发挥了主力军的作用。
    毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”毛主席的这一英明指示，给了首都工交城建战线广大革命职工以极其强大的思想武器，他们最坚决地响应毛主席这一伟大战斗号令，主动向无产阶级的敌人发起猛烈的进攻。他们站在阶级斗争的前列，向敌人斗争最英勇，最坚决，最富有无产阶级彻底革命的精神。
    目前，首都工交城建战线正在更加广泛深入地掀起一场革命大批判的“人民战争”。广大革命职工以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的一小撮死不悔改的走资派、叛徒、特务作斗争，从各个领域肃清他们的反革命修正主义流毒。在北京矿务局木城涧煤矿，到处是狠批中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在工矿企业代理人的战场。革命工人、革命干部、退休老工人、革命职工家属，都加入了革命大批判的战斗行列。在革命大批判中，广大革命职工活学活用毛泽东思想，阶级斗争观念和路线斗争觉悟大大提高。他们牢记毛主席的要“善于辨别那些伪装拥护革命而实际反对革命的分子”的教导，坚决揭露反革命阴谋家、野心家、两面派，坚决把混进革命队伍中的一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派以及一切反革命分子挖出来，斗倒斗臭，进一步巩固和加强了无产阶级专政，巩固和加强了革命委员会，巩固和发展了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，进一步发展了空前大好的革命形势。
    无产阶级文化大革命越接近全面胜利，反革命力量越要同革命力量作拚死的斗争。在一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派刮起翻案妖风的时候，首都工人阶级岿然不动，他们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚决打击阶级敌人的翻案妖风，坚决反对右倾分裂主义、右倾投降主义、右倾保守主义，彻底粉碎了无产阶级的敌人的新反扑。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“革命委员会的基本经验有三条：一条是有革命干部的代表，一条是有军队的代表，一条是有革命群众的代表，实现了革命的三结合。革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”
    首都广大革命职工认真学习，深刻领会，坚决执行毛主席关于革命委员会的最新指示。他们认识到，毛主席的光辉指示，是革命委员会建设的根本方向和工作的根本纲领，一定要活学活用毛主席这一光辉指示，把革命委员会建设成无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的革命化的联系群众的领导班子。北京针织总厂革命委员会在八三四一部队支左人员热情帮助下，把活学活用毛泽东思想，放在高于一切，大于一切，先于一切，重于一切的地位，坚定不移地走突出无产阶级政治的道路。革命委员会成员和广大革命职工一起，坚持天天读毛主席的书，遇事向毛主席著作请教，大办毛泽东思想学习班，狠抓阶级斗争，不断提高斗私批修的水平，使革命委员会在非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的大道上阔步前进。
    各单位革委会的成员深深体会到，革命委员会能不能按无产阶级党性原则掌好权、用好权，这是忠不忠于毛主席的重大考验。因此，他们更加自觉地活学活用毛泽东思想，进一步增强无产阶级党性，反对资产阶级派性，全心全意地为人民服务。
    毛主席教导我们：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”首都工交城建战线广大革命职工，最热爱人民解放军，最拥护人民解放军，对毛主席亲自缔造和领导的、林副主席直接指挥的举世无双的人民军队，怀有无比深厚的无产阶级感情，坚定不移地“相信和依靠人民解放军”。当一小撮叛徒、特务、死不悔改的走资派和反革命分子阴险地把矛头指向人民解放军，妄图破坏“三支”“两军”工作，挑拨军民关系的时候，首都工人阶级挺身而出，坚决揭露和彻底粉碎阶级敌人的阴谋诡计。广大革命职工认为，“相信和依靠人民解放军”，这是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的重要组成部分。相信不相信解放军，依不依靠解放军，是忠不忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的大是大非问题，是区别真革命和假革命的大是大非问题。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席关于革命三结合的伟大指示，把军民团结提高到前所未有的新高度，把“拥军爱民”运动，推进到一个新的阶段。军民团结一致，结成了保卫无产阶级专政的钢铁长城。
