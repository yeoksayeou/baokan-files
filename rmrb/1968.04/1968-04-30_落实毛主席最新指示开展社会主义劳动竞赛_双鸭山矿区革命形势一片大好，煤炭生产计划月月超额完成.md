The revolutionary committees at all levels in the Shuangyashan mining district of Heilongjiang Province, with the help of the leftist support troops stationed in the mine, have focused on the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads. They have carried out a deep and sustained revolutionary criticism, mobilizing the broad revolutionary workers to take the initiative to attack the class enemies. The revolutionary situation is excellent, and production is rapidly increasing. Since this year, this mining district has overfulfilled the plan every month. In the first quarter, every shaft and every coal mining team in the entire mine achieved the state plan every day. The coal production plan for January to April was overfulfilled five days ahead of schedule.

Shuangyashan Coal Mine is one of the key coal mines in Heilongjiang Province. As early as last August, more than 100 units in the entire mining district had established revolutionary committees. The revolutionary committees at all levels in this coal mine deeply understand that to further develop the excellent situation of revolution and production in the entire mine, they must remember the great leader Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle" and first of all, focus on class struggle. Therefore, the revolutionary committees at all levels have, in conjunction with the actual class struggle in their own units, continuously organized revolutionary workers to carry out revolutionary criticism, launching a fierce attack on the enemies of the proletarian revolution. Recently, the broad revolutionary workers in the entire mining district have used Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions as weapons to severely criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies such as the "extinction of class struggle" theory spread by China's Khrushchev, launching a high tide of revolutionary criticism.

Now, the leftist support troops in this mining district are helping the revolutionary workers in the mining district to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, launch socialist labor competitions and technological innovation activities. The Jianji Tunneling Team of Baoshan Mine in this mining district has launched the activity of becoming a multi-skilled worker in mining and tunneling, greatly improving the tunneling level, and the tunneling progress has increased from 100 meters per day to 200 meters, reaching the highest level in the history of this mine. After the practice of this tunneling team was promoted throughout the mining district, the tunneling progress increased by 20% compared to the original. This mine also improved the production process of thin coal seams, greatly increasing coal production efficiency, and promoting the coal production of many mines to increase several times.

    落实毛主席最新指示开展社会主义劳动竞赛
    双鸭山矿区革命形势一片大好，煤炭生产计划月月超额完成
    新华社哈尔滨二十九日电　黑龙江省双鸭山矿区各级革命委员会，在驻矿支左部队的帮助下，狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，发动广大革命职工主动向阶级敌人进攻，革命形势大好，生产迅速上升。今年以来，这个矿区月月超额完成计划，第一季度全矿每个井口、每个采煤队都做到了天天完成国家计划，一至四月的煤炭生产计划已提前五天超额完成。
    双鸭山煤矿是黑龙江省重点煤矿之一，早在去年八月份，全矿区的一百多个单位就都建立了革命委员会。这个煤矿的各级革命委员会深深体会到，要进一步发展全矿革命和生产的大好形势，必须牢记伟大领袖毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，首先狠抓阶级斗争。因此，各级革命委员会都结合本单位阶级斗争的实际，不断地组织革命职工开展革命的大批判，向无产阶级革命的敌人猛烈进攻。最近，全矿区的广大革命职工又以毛主席的一系列最新指示为武器，狠狠批判了中国赫鲁晓夫散布的“阶级斗争熄灭”论等反革命修正主义谬论，掀起了革命大批判的高潮。
    现在，这个矿区的支左部队又帮助矿区的革命职工举办毛泽东思想学习班，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，开展社会主义劳动竞赛和技术革新活动。这个矿区的宝山矿太平井刚毅掘进队开展了采掘多面手活动，大大提高了掘进水平，掘进进度由日产一百米提高到二百米，达到了这个矿历史上的最高水平。这个掘进队的做法在全矿区推广以后，掘进进度比原来提高了百分之二十。这个矿还改进了薄煤层的生产工艺，大大提高了煤炭生产效率，促使许多矿井的煤炭产量成倍增长。
