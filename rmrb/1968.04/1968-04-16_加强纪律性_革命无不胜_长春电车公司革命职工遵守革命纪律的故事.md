Workers of Changchun Tramway Company Follow Revolutionary Discipline

The revolutionary workers of Changchun Tramway Company, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "strengthen discipline, revolution is invincible," resolutely resist the influence of anarchist tendencies, consciously break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness, and adhere to revolutionary discipline. Many moving examples have emerged. Below are two small stories.

Listen to Chairman Mao's Instructions

Blue Weiqian, a veteran worker in Track Section 2, is responsible for maintaining the tram tracks and switches. To ensure safe operation during the winter, the track section has established a rule: whenever it snows, regardless of whether it is day or night, the accumulated snow on the tracks and switches must be immediately cleared away. Blue strictly follows this rule without exception.

One day, after Blue returned home from work, he, as usual, listened to the weather forecast and went outside to check the weather. He told his wife, "The weather is going to change tonight, so sleep lightly, and if it snows, call me." However, before his wife could call him, he woke up twice on his own to check outside. In the middle of the night, it indeed started to snow. Blue quickly got up and was about to go out. His eldest son, seeing that he had recently undergone a partial gastrectomy and was not very strong, and that the distance from home to the work area was about six or seven miles, tried to dissuade him, saying, "It's the middle of the night, and the wind and snow are heavy. Missing a couple of snow clearings won't make much difference!" Blue heard this and felt that the words were wrong. He thought of the class enemies spreading anarchist tendencies, attempting to influence people to disregard the disciplines and rules they should follow and the systems they should execute. He felt that every revolutionary worker should consciously adhere to revolutionary discipline and regulations, and use their actions to foil the class enemies' plots. Thinking of this, he pointed to the "Serve the People" badge on his chest and said to his son, "Chairman Mao teaches us to 'Serve the People.' We are responsible for two kilometers of tracks and thirty-four switches. We must listen to Chairman Mao's instructions. Not only should we not be afraid of wind and snow, but even if it were raining daggers, we must guard them well!"

After saying this, he picked up his tools and stepped out of the door.

This was the largest snowstorm of the winter, with biting cold winds mixed with snowflakes, hitting Blue's face like a knife. He recited Chairman Mao's teachings: "With firm determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory," and vigorously cleared the accumulated snow from the sides of the tracks and the switches, then sprinkled salt to prevent freezing. He fought against the wind and snow, and the more he worked, the more energetic he became. By dawn, when the first tram started, he had already cleared the ice and snow cleanly. He saw the tram, loaded with passengers going to work, safely passing through, and a victorious smile appeared on his face.

Chairman Mao's Instructions Are a Guiding Light

Young female worker Zhu Guijin lives in the suburbs of Changchun. Every day, she has to walk five miles and then take two stops on the train to get to the tram company.

One day, Zhu, as usual, left home at five in the morning. However, when she arrived at the train station, the train she was supposed to take had already left half an hour early due to a schedule change. The next train would not arrive for another five and a half hours, which put Zhu in a difficult situation. What should she do? Should she walk to work? This place is still more than forty miles from the city, and the weather is very cold. At this moment, she saw a few passengers who had missed the train walking back, and she thought to herself: It's better to go back home, after all, missing a day of work is not one's own intention.

Just as Zhu was about to turn back, she looked up and saw the words "Seize the Revolution, Promote Production" written on the wall of the station. These words made Zhu's heart tremble. She recalled that not long ago, when the company achieved revolutionary great alliance, the revolutionary workers passed a resolution, proposing to consciously adhere to labor discipline and resolutely fight against absenteeism. Why, when encountering a little difficulty today, did she have the thought of being absent from work? Thinking of this, Zhu blushed and felt that she had not seriously listened to Chairman Mao's words regarding adhering to labor discipline. At this moment, the words "Seize the Revolution, Promote Production" in front of Zhu shone like a guiding light, even more brightly. She resolutely turned around, facing the biting cold wind, and with determined steps, walked towards the company.

At noon, Zhu finally arrived at the tram company, just in time for her comrades to study Chairman Mao's works. Zhu said to her comrades, "I am late, and I have missed the study." When everyone found out about Zhu's delay, they said: No, you have not missed the study. Your spirit of consciously adhering to revolutionary discipline is precisely the result of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's teachings.

### 加强纪律性　革命无不胜  长春电车公司革命职工遵守革命纪律的故事

    加强纪律性　革命无不胜
    长春电车公司革命职工遵守革命纪律的故事
    长春电车公司广大革命职工遵照伟大领袖毛主席“加强纪律性，革命无不胜”的教导，坚决抵制无政府主义思潮的影响，自觉地破私立公，遵守革命纪律，出现了许多动人的事例。下面介绍的是两则小故事。咱要听毛主席的指挥
    轨道二组的蓝伟乾老师傅，担任电车轨道和道岔子的维护工作。为了保证冬季安全行车，轨道组订了一条制度：下了雪，不管是白天或是夜晚，都要立即把轨道和道岔子上的积雪清除干净。蓝师傅执行这条制度非常认真，雷打不动。
    有一天，蓝师傅下班回家后，照例听了天气预报，又到外面看了看天。他跟老伴说：“今天晚上又要变天气，睡机警点，下雪就叫我。”可是，没等老伴叫，他就一连起来两次，出去查看。下半夜，果然下起雪来。蓝师傅一骨碌爬起来，就要往外走。他大儿子想到他刚做过局部胃切除手术，身板不太硬实，从家到工作区还有六七里路，怕他累着，因而劝阻说：“深更半夜的，风雪又大，少扫一次两次雪也没啥！”蓝师傅一听，觉得这话不对。他联想到阶级敌人散布无政府主义思潮，企图影响人们对该遵守的纪律不遵守，该执行的制度不执行的情况，就觉得每一个革命工人，都应该自觉地遵守革命纪律和规章制度，用自己的行动来粉碎阶级敌人的阴谋。他想到这里，便指着胸前佩戴的“为人民服务”语录章，对儿子说：“毛主席教导咱‘为人民服务’，把两公里轨道和三十四个道岔子交给了咱，咱就要听毛主席的指挥，别说是刮风下雪，就是下刀子，也要把它看好！”
    说完，他扛起工具，大步走出家门。
    这是入冬以来最大的一场风雪，刺骨的寒风夹带着雪片，打在蓝师傅脸上，象刀刮的一样。他默诵着毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，奋力把轨道两旁和道岔子里的积雪清扫出去，然后又撒上防冻的盐巴。他斗风战雪，越干越起劲。清晨，当第一班电车开出来的时候，他已把冰雪清扫得干干净净了。他看到电车满载着上班的乘客，安全通过，脸上流露出胜利的微笑。
    毛主席的教导是指路明灯
    青年女工朱桂琴的家在长春市郊区，她到电车公司上班，每天都要先步行五里地，然后再乘两站火车。
    一天，小朱同往常一样，早晨五点就从家里出发了。可是，当她到达火车站的时候，她要乘坐的那趟火车因为改点，已经提前半小时开走了。而下一趟火车还要等五个多小时才能到来，这下可把小朱难住了，怎么办呢？走着上班吧，这儿离城里还有四十多里地，天气又非常冷。这时，她看到几个没有赶上火车的乘客已经往回走了，心里不禁想：还是回家去算了，反正误一天班也不是自己的本意。
    小朱正要往回走，一抬头看见车站墙壁上写着毛主席的亲切教导：“抓革命，促生产”。这几个大字，使小朱心里猛然一震。她想起不久前，公司实现革命大联合时，广大革命职工通过了一项决议，提出要自觉遵守劳动纪律，坚决向旷工现象作斗争。为什么今天碰到一点点困难，就产生了想旷工的念头呢？想到这里，小朱不觉脸红了，她感到自己在遵守劳动纪律这个问题上，还没有认真听毛主席的话。这时，“抓革命，促生产”几个大字，在小朱面前，就象指路明灯一样，更加红光耀眼。她毅然转过头来，迎着凛冽的寒风，迈着坚定的步子，向公司的方向走去。
    中午，小朱终于到了电车公司，正赶上同志们在学习毛主席著作。小朱对同志们说：“我来晚了，耽误了学习。”当大家弄清小朱晚到的经过后，都说：不，你没有耽误学习，你这样自觉遵守革命纪律的精神，正是活学活用毛主席教导的成果。
