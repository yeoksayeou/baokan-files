Guinean friends have in recent days been expressing their views to Xinhua News Agency correspondents, enthusiastically hailing Chairman Mao's declaration in support of the struggle of American blacks against violence. They praise this declaration as a beacon, illuminating the path of struggle for American blacks and all oppressed and exploited peoples of the world.

A friend named Dioubat Mak said, "Chairman Mao's declaration is a document of great historical significance."

He said, "The assassination of the non-violent advocate Martin Luther King not only marks the bankruptcy of non-violence but also once again proves that only by following the path indicated by Chairman Mao, that is, the path of armed struggle, can blacks and all oppressed peoples and nations break free from the shackles of imperialism."

He said, "Chairman Mao is the greatest leader of all oppressed peoples and nations of the world. Chairman Mao has always sympathized with and supported their struggle against imperialism and for liberation. We African revolutionary people are determined to respond to Chairman Mao's great call: 'All the people of the world, unite more closely, launch a sustained and vigorous offensive against our common enemy, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys!'"

A young printer said, "Chairman Mao's declaration is a beacon, illuminating the path of struggle for blacks and the oppressed peoples of other countries against imperialist oppressors and exploiters, and for final liberation. It fills us with determination to defeat our enemies who are strong externally but weak internally, and it fills us with confidence in a bright future."

He said, "We must always bear in mind the revolutionary truth pointed out by the great teacher Chairman Mao, and resolutely use revolutionary violence to counter imperialist counter-revolutionary violence."

A Guinean journalist said, "Chairman Mao is the greatest revolutionary leader of our time, and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the guide to world revolution."

He said, "Chairman Mao's declaration is a battle cry. It will greatly promote the struggle of American blacks and other oppressed peoples."

A friend named Bubakar said, "Chairman Mao's declaration greatly encourages the peoples of various countries who are waging struggles, and it deals a heavy blow to U.S.-led imperialism."

    他说，毛主席是全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族最伟大的领袖，毛主席一贯同情和支持他们反对帝国主义和争取解放的斗争。我们非洲革命人民决心响应毛主席的这一伟大号召：“全世界人民更紧密地团结起来，向着我们的共同敌人美帝国主义及其帮凶们发动持久的猛烈的进攻！”
    一位青年印刷工人说，毛主席的声明是一盏指路明灯，照亮了黑人和其他国家被压迫人民反对帝国主义压迫者和剥削者、争取最后解放的斗争道路，它使我们充满决心去战胜外强中干的敌人，并使我们对光辉的前途充满信心。
    他说，我们应该永远牢记伟大导师毛主席所指出的革命真理，坚决用革命的暴力反对帝国主义的反革命的暴力。
    一位几内亚新闻记者说，毛主席是当代最伟大的革命领袖，战无不胜的毛泽东思想是世界革命的指南。
    他说，毛主席的声明，是一个战斗的号角，它必将大大促进美国黑人和其他被压迫人民的斗争。
    一位名叫布巴卡尔的朋友说，毛主席的声明，给正在进行斗争的各国人民以巨大的鼓舞，给予以美国为首的帝国主义以沉重的打击。
