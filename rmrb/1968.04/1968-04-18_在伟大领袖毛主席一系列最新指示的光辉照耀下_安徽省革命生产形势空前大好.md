Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the revolutionary and production situation in Anhui Province is extremely good. The entire province is experiencing a high tide of establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes. All prefectures and cities have achieved revolutionary great unity, and grassroots units are establishing revolutionary committees one after another.

A Xinhua News Agency report from Hefei on the 17th states: Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination in Anhui Province are surging forward, and production is steadily increasing. The revolutionary and production situation in the entire province is extremely good and is getting better and better. By April 15th, all 15 prefectures and cities in the province had achieved revolutionary great unity, and more than 80% of the 75 counties (towns) had achieved revolutionary great unity. Based on the consolidation and development of revolutionary great unity, the revolutionary three-in-one combination is rapidly developing. At present, regions and cities such as Lu'an, Ma'anshan, Huainan, and Tongling, as well as a batch of counties, have established revolutionary committees. Grassroots factories, enterprises, rural people's communes, colleges and universities, as well as primary and secondary schools, are also establishing revolutionary committees one after another. With the development of revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, a good situation has also emerged on the industrial and agricultural fronts. Coal and steel production are increasing day by day, transportation volume is continuously improving, and spring plowing, spring sowing, and water conservancy projects in agriculture are also being carried out with great enthusiasm.

The extremely good revolutionary and production situation in Anhui Province is the result of the entire province's proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Establishing study classes is a good method; many problems can be solved in study classes." The People's Liberation Army's support-left troops in Anhui and the broad proletarian revolutionary factions regard establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes as an important strategic task. Factories, schools, cities, rural areas, and the military all establish them, and the entire province, urban and rural areas, is experiencing a high tide of establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes. According to incomplete statistics, the province has established over 110,000 study classes, with over 4.8 million people participating. In the study classes, the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, following the revolutionary study style advocated by Chairman Mao, use "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the guiding principle, fiercely struggle against bourgeois factionalism, enhance proletarian party spirit, and consolidate and develop revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination.

Chairman Mao teaches: "Correctly handling cadres is a key issue in implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating revolutionary great unity, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit. This issue must be resolved." The proletarian revolutionary factions in Anhui Province, under the guidance of Chairman Mao, with the help of the support-left troops, established study classes with cadres at all levels participating. Broad revolutionary cadres in the study classes fiercely struggle against selfishness, deeply touch their souls, and strive to change their worldviews. They often actively go to the masses to check on themselves, have heart-to-heart talks with the masses, and seek the masses' opinions. The broad masses also enthusiastically help revolutionary cadres recognize their mistakes, correctly treat themselves, and correctly treat the masses, returning to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Therefore, from the province to the people's communes, a large number of revolutionary cadres have been liberated, greatly accelerating the steps of the revolutionary three-in-one combination and creating conditions for the establishment of the provincial revolutionary committee.

The broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres in Anhui Province also channel the revolutionary enthusiasm released during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into production. They overcome the anarchist ideology that harms production, shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production, and promote the development of industrial and agricultural production.

The broad revolutionary masses in Anhui Province realize that the closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to complete victory, the sharper and more complex the class struggle becomes. They firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "All reactionary forces, when they are about to perish, will always make desperate struggles." They are determined to take class struggle as the key link, deeply and persistently carry out the great criticism, thoroughly criticize, expose, and overthrow Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Anhui, and eliminate all the poison they spread. Through the great criticism, they raise their awareness of class struggle and line struggle, further consolidate and develop revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, and greatly advance the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Anhui Province.

    在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的光辉照耀下
    安徽省革命生产形势空前大好
    全省出现大办毛泽东思想学习班高潮，所有专、市实现革命大联合，基层单位纷纷成立革委会
    新华社合肥十七日电　在伟大领袖毛主席一系列最新指示的光辉照耀下，安徽省革命大联合和革命三结合的洪流滚滚向前，生产日益增长，全省革命、生产形势一派大好，而且越来越好。到四月十五日，全省十五个专、市已经全部实现了革命大联合，七十五个县（镇）中百分之八十以上实现了革命大联合。在革命大联合巩固发展的基础上，革命三结合迅速发展。现在，全省已有六安、马鞍山、淮南、铜陵等地区和市以及一批县成立了革命委员会。基层工厂、企业、农村人民公社、大专院校以及中小学校也纷纷成立革命委员会。随着革命大联合和革命三结合的发展，工农业战线上也出现了大好形势，煤炭和钢铁生产日益增长，交通运输量不断提高，农业生产方面的春耕、春种、兴修水利，也搞得热火朝天。
    安徽省革命、生产大好形势的出现是全省无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的最新指示的成果。伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”人民解放军驻安徽支左部队和广大无产阶级革命派，把大办毛泽东思想学习班当作一项重要的战略任务。工厂办、学校办、城市办、农村办、部队也办，全省城乡出现了大办毛泽东思想学习班的高潮。据不完全统计，全省已办学习班十一万多期，参加学习班的达四百八十多万人。广大革命群众和革命干部在学习班里，发扬毛主席倡导的理论联系实际的革命学风，以“斗私，批修”为纲，大斗狠斗资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，巩固和发展了革命大联合和革命三结合。
    毛主席教导说：“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。”安徽省无产阶级革命派遵照毛主席这一教导，在支左部队的帮助下，大办有各级干部参加的学习班。广大革命干部在学习班里，狠斗私字，狠触灵魂，努力改造自己的世界观。他们经常主动地到群众中去检查，和群众促膝谈心，征求群众的意见。广大群众也热情地帮助革命干部认识错误，正确对待自己，正确对待群众，回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，因而，从省到人民公社，解放了大批革命干部，有力地加快了革命三结合的步伐，为建立省革命委员会创造了条件。
    安徽省广大革命群众和革命干部，还把无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的革命积极性用到生产上去，他们克服了危害生产的无政府主义思潮，挑起了革命和生产两副重担，推动了工农业生产的发展。
    安徽省广大革命群众认识到，无产阶级文化大革命越是接近全面胜利，阶级斗争越尖锐复杂，他们牢记伟大领袖毛主席“一切反动势力在他们行将灭亡的时候，总是要进行垂死挣扎的”教导，决心以阶级斗争为纲，深入持久地开展革命大批判，把中国赫鲁晓夫及其在安徽的代理人批深、批透、批倒、批臭，肃清他们散布的一切流毒。通过革命大批判提高阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟，进一步巩固和发展了革命大联合和革命三结合，把安徽省的无产阶级文化大革命大大推进一步。
