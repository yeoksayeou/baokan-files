Recently, in our construction brigade, a strange wind blew in from somewhere. Some people used work hours to privately use state-owned wood and steel to make boxes and hammers, and then kept them for themselves. This behavior seriously affected the completion of state tasks and also wasted valuable state resources.

The Revolutionary Committee decided to hold a Mao Zedong Thought study class to raise the class consciousness of the masses. The class studied Chairman Mao's instructions on saving and making revolution, discussed the good situation in our brigade, and analyzed and studied the movements of class enemies. At the same time, members of the Revolutionary Committee went to various teams to find the root cause with the masses. After the masses were fully mobilized, the root cause was found. It turned out that this strange wind was stirred up by a capitalist-roader.

The capitalist-roader in our brigade was exposed during the Cultural Revolution. He seemed like a "dead tiger" on the surface, but in his heart, he harbored deep hatred for the new Revolutionary Committee and the revolutionary masses. During this period, the Revolutionary Committee had just been established, and comrades were busy with other specific matters, not paying enough attention to criticizing and struggling against him. He took the opportunity to use state steel to make several planes. He showed these items to people with serious "selfish" tendencies, boasting, "To buy this plane, you need to spend so much money." He also incited, "If you don't make a few now, you won't have the chance later. Miss this village, and you won't find this shop again." Some of our comrades were influenced by him and consciously or unconsciously followed suit.

This incident gave every comrade a vivid lesson in class struggle. The establishment of the Revolutionary Committee is not the end of class struggle but the beginning of deepening class struggle. Forgetting the enemy is the biggest fool. Comrades who were deceived in this incident were even more shocked. Some comrades said: If selfish thoughts are heavy, you will mistake the enemy for a friend.

Now, the spiritual outlook of the broad revolutionary workers in our brigade has changed significantly. As long as there is any sign of waste, everyone will pay attention. The labor discipline of revolutionary workers has also been further strengthened.

    什么时候也不能忘了敌人
    前一个时期，在我们施工大队不知从那儿刮来一股歪风，有些人占用工作时间，私自动用国家的木材、钢材做箱子、锤子，并且攫为私有。这种行动，严重地影响了国家任务的完成，同时还浪费了国家贵重资材。
    革命委员会决定举办毛泽东思想学习班，以提高广大群众的阶级觉悟。学习班学习了毛主席有关节约闹革命的指示，议论了本队大好形势，分析研究了阶级敌人的动向。同时，革命委员会的成员分别下到各班组，和群众一起查根源。群众充分发动起来以后，根子找出来了，原来这股歪风是走资派煽动起来的。
    我们队的走资派，在文化大革命中被揪出来以后，他表面上好象一只“死老虎”，但内心却对新生的革命委员会和革命群众怀着刻骨仇恨。前一个时期，革命委员会刚成立，同志们忙于其他具体事务，没有抓紧对他进行批判和斗争，这个走资派趁机就动用国家钢材，打了好几把刨刀。他拿了这些东西，到一些“私”字严重的人面前炫耀，说什么“要买这把刨刀得花多少钱”。他还煽动说，“现在不做几把，以后机会就不好找了，过了这个村，就没有这个店了。”我们有一些同志，受了他的影响，自觉或不自觉地跟着做起来了。
    这一件事，给每个同志都上了一堂生动的阶级斗争课。革命委员会成立不是阶级斗争的结束，而是深入开展阶级斗争的开端。忘了敌人，就是最大的糊涂虫。在这个事件中上了当的同志，思想上震动更大。有一些同志说：私心杂念重了，就会把敌人看成朋友。
    现在我们队广大革命职工的精神面貌有了显著变化，只要一有浪费苗头出现，就会引起大家的注意，革命职工的劳动纪律也进一步加强了。
