A Profound Class Education

Not long ago, a unit in a people's commune in Beijing's Chaoyang District established a revolutionary committee. The revolutionary masses were overjoyed and celebrated the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

"The day the people rejoice is the day the counter-revolutionaries suffer." One day, a group of people suddenly appeared at the gate of the revolutionary committee. They caused trouble and deliberately made things difficult. At that time, the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team happened to be present. They immediately opened the "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" and organized the on-site masses to study Chairman Mao's great teaching, "Never forget class struggle." Great Mao Zedong Thought opened the eyes of the masses. On the spot, the deceived masses turned against the enemy and exposed a historical counter-revolutionary who had been scheming behind the scenes. This evil person was a notorious reactionary Kuomintang member before liberation, a loyal servant of the landlord class, who had managed the landlord's household and oppressed the peasants. After liberation, the Party and the people implemented proletarian dictatorship over him, but he harbored resentment and resisted reform. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, this counter-revolutionary emerged, openly counterattacking the revolutionary people. He colluded with a capitalist-roader within the Party, spreading malicious rumors and stirring up trouble everywhere, inciting the masses to fight each other. Now that the revolutionary committee has been established, it has pronounced his doom. Thus, he dared to take to the streets, inciting a part of the masses to cause trouble at the gate of the revolutionary committee, attempting to undermine the prestige of the newly born proletarian regime and achieve the evil goal of restoring capitalism.

The revolutionary masses' exposure and criticism revealed this counter-revolutionary's true colors in broad daylight. As a result, the scene of the disturbance turned into a meeting for exposing and criticizing the bad elements, raising the masses' awareness of class struggle and providing them with a vivid class struggle education. In connection with this incident, the revolutionary committee of this unit took class struggle as the key link, organized a Mao Zedong Thought study class, and further exposed the class struggle cover-up within the unit. The bad elements were exposed, and the good elements stood out. The great alliance of revolutionaries and the three-in-one combination were further consolidated and developed.

    一次深刻的阶级教育
    不久以前，北京朝阳区某公社有个单位成立了革命委员会，革命群众欢欣鼓舞，庆祝无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。
    “人民大众开心之日，就是反革命分子难受之时”。一天，革委会门前忽然来了一批人，他们无理取闹，故意刁难。当时驻地解放军毛泽东思想宣传队正好在场，当即打开了《毛主席语录》，组织在场的群众学习了毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导。伟大的毛泽东思想擦亮了群众的眼睛，当场，受蒙蔽的群众，纷纷反戈一击，揪出了一个在背后搞鬼的历史反革命分子。这个坏家伙解放前是个作恶多端的反动的国民党员，是地主阶级忠实奴仆，给地主管过家，欺压农民。解放后，党和人民对他实行了无产阶级专政，他一直怀恨在心，抗拒改造。在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，这个反革命分子跳出来了，他明目张胆地向革命人民反攻倒算，他伙同党内一个走资派，到处煽阴风，点邪火，挑动群众斗群众。现在革命委员会成立了，宣判了他的末日到来，于是，他不惜赤膊上阵，煽动一部分群众到革命委员会门前闹事，企图破坏新生的无产阶级政权的威信，达到复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。
    革命群众的揭发和批判，使这个反革命分子的原形暴露在光天化日之下，结果使闹事的现场变成了揭发和批判坏人的会场，提高了群众阶级斗争的观念，使群众受到了一次生动的阶级斗争的教育。结合这件事，这个单位的革命委员会以阶级斗争为纲，举办了毛泽东思想学习班，进一步大揭本单位的阶级斗争盖子。坏人揭发出来了，好人站出来了，革命的大联合、革命的三结合得到进一步巩固和发展。
