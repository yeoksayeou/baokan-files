The meeting of the finance ministers of ten Western countries held in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, ended in disarray after heated arguments between the American and French representatives. This meeting reflected the fact that the capitalist financial and monetary system centered around the dollar is in an incurable crisis, and the further decline of American imperialism is inevitable. It also reflected that as imperialism heads towards comprehensive collapse, the contradictions and struggles among imperialist countries are intensifying, and imperialism is further fragmenting.

In an attempt to save the dollar, which is on the brink of collapse, the United States sought to force through its so-called "Special Drawing Rights" plan at this meeting. France, on the other hand, aimed to use this meeting to undermine the dollar and change the capitalist world's financial and monetary system centered around the dollar. This is an important round in the currency war among imperialist countries for financial hegemony. Despite the United States using various means to rally some Western European countries, France remained firm in its opposition, demanding a change in the current monetary system. Moreover, the agreement of some other Western European countries to implement the "Special Drawing Rights" does not mean they agree to the dollar's "hegemonic" status. Although the "Special Drawing Rights" are written in the meeting's communiqué, there are still many difficulties in actually implementing them. The currency war between the U.S. and the U.K. on one side, and France and other Western European countries on the other, will not only not ease but will become increasingly intense.

The fierce battle among imperialist countries over financial and monetary issues is not an isolated phenomenon. Over the past twenty-plus years since the war, the balance of power among imperialist countries has changed. On one hand, the "strength" position of American imperialism has significantly declined; on the other hand, the "strength" of Western European countries, represented by France, has relatively increased. Thus, countries like France inevitably challenge American hegemony and demand a share of hegemony according to the changed "strength." At the same time, under the impact of the world revolutionary storm, the entire imperialist system is accelerating its collapse, and a capitalist world economic crisis is imminent. Each imperialist country is trying to drown its competitors to save itself. Under these circumstances, the contradictions and struggles among imperialist countries will inevitably become more intense. The current attack by Western European countries, led by France, on the United States in the financial and monetary sphere is an important sign of the intensifying contradictions among imperialist countries.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The various irreconcilable contradictions within and without are like a volcano that threatens American imperialism every day. American imperialism is sitting on this volcano."

Although American imperialism obtained a communiqué deciding to establish "Special Drawing Rights" at the Stockholm meeting, this does not alleviate its internal and external predicaments. American imperialism is now a declining power, much like the Rongguo Mansion in "Dream of the Red Chamber," which "though the exterior facade has not yet collapsed, the inner resources are exhausted." In the face of the rapidly developing world revolutionary situation, the changes in the balance of power among imperialist countries determine that imperialism will further fragment, the "hegemonic" status of American imperialism will collapse, and the imperialist system will inevitably accelerate its comprehensive collapse.

    日暮途穷　四分五裂
    本报评论员
    瑞典首都斯德哥尔摩举行的西方十国财政部长会议，在美国和法国代表激烈争吵之后，不欢而散。这次会议，反映了以美元为中心的资本主义金融货币体系的危机是无可救药的，美帝国主义的进一步衰落是不可避免的；它还反映了在帝国主义走向全面崩溃的过程中，帝国主义国家之间的矛盾和角斗日益加剧，帝国主义正在进一步四分五裂。
    美帝国主义为了要给快要垮台的美元捞一根救命草，想在这次会议上强行通过它的所谓“特别提款权”计划。法国则要利用这次会议搞垮美元，改变以美元为中心的资本主义世界的金融货币制度。这是帝国主义国家为争夺金融霸权而进行的货币战的一个重要回合。尽管美国运用种种手段拉拢了一些西欧国家，法国还是坚持它的反对立场，要求改变现行货币制度。况且，其他一些西欧国家同意实行“特别提款权”，并不意味着它们同意美元的“霸主”地位。美国梦寐以求的所谓“特别提款权”虽然写在会议公报上，但是真正实行起来，还有着许许多多的困难。以美英为一方，以法国为代表的西欧国家为一方的货币战，今后不仅不会趋于缓和，而只会越来越白热化。
    帝国主义之间围绕着金融货币问题而展开的这一场恶战，不是偶然的现象。战后二十多年来，帝国主义之间的力量对比有了变化。一方面，美帝国主义的“实力”地位大大下降了；另一方面，以法国为代表的西欧国家的“实力”相对地增强。这样，法国等西欧国家就必然要向美国的霸权挑战，要求按照已经改变了的“实力”分享霸权。同时，在世界革命风暴的打击下，整个帝国主义制度正在加速崩溃，而一场资本主义世界的经济危机又日益临近。各个帝国主义国家无不企图淹死自己的竞争者，而使自己能够爬上岸来。在这种情况下，帝国主义之间的矛盾和斗争必然变得更加激烈。目前以法国为代表的西欧国家在金融货币领域里向美国发起的进攻，就是帝国主义之间的矛盾日益激化的一个重要标志。
    我们伟大的导师毛主席教导说：“国内国外的各种不可调和的矛盾，就象一座火山，每天都在威胁美国帝国主义，美国帝国主义就是坐在这座火山上。”
    美帝国主义在斯德哥尔摩会议上虽然得到了决定建立“特别提款权”的一纸公报，但是这并不能解除它内外交困的窘境。美帝国主义已经是一个败落的大户，有如《红楼梦》里的荣国府，“如今外面的架子虽没很倒，内囊却也尽上来了。”在世界革命形势迅速发展的情况下，帝国主义各国力量对比的变化，决定了帝国主义一定要进一步四分五裂，美帝国主义的“霸主”地位一定要垮台，帝国主义制度必然要加速走向全面崩溃。
