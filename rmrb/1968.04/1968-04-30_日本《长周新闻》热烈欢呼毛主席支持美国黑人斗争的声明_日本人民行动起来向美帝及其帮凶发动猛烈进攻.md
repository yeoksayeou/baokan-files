	Japanese *Chōshū Shinbun* recently published an editorial highly praising Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence. The editorial emphasized that Chairman Mao's statement is not only the most enthusiastic support and encouragement for the struggle of American blacks but also for all peoples around the world who are fighting against American imperialism.

	The editorial pointed out that Chairman Mao's statement profoundly expounded on the relationship between the struggle of American blacks and the struggle of peoples of all countries against American imperialism. It also called on workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and all those who are willing to fight against American imperialism in every country to take action and give strong support to the struggle of American blacks.

	The editorial said that Chairman Mao pointed out that racial discrimination in the United States is a product of colonialism and imperialism. The contradiction between American blacks and the American ruling class is a class contradiction, and it has indicated a path to victory for the struggle of American blacks.

	The editorial said that Chairman Mao pointed out in the statement: "It can be asserted that the thorough collapse of colonialism, imperialism, and all systems of exploitation, and the thorough liberation of all oppressed peoples and nations, is not far off." Chairman Mao's scientific judgment inspires and encourages people all over the world.

	In discussing the excellent international situation, the editorial said that China, which accounts for one-fourth of the world's population, is on the verge of achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The heroic anti-American national salvation struggle of the Vietnamese people, as well as the struggle against American imperialism and its lackeys throughout Asia, Africa, and Latin America, is blazing like a wildfire.

	The editorial pointed out that the struggle of the Japanese people against American imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries, against Soviet modern revisionism and the Revisionist group of Kyūmon, is also expanding and developing. As a component of the international anti-American united front, the struggle of the Japanese people is advancing towards victory.

	The editorial finally called on the Japanese people to respond to Chairman Mao's call, to take action, participate in the anti-American patriotic struggle, and launch a sustained and fierce attack on American imperialism and its lackeys.
