Voluntary Labor – The Great School of the Revolution
A Record of Albanian Youth’s Voluntary Labor in Building the Logarçin-Fieri Railway for One Year

In the area along the highway about fifty kilometers north of the industrial city of Fier in western Albania, millions of young voluntary laborers are busy building a railway parallel to the highway from Logarçin to Fier. The construction site is bustling with a lively atmosphere of labor.

Upon entering the command center of the voluntary laborers, the first thing that catches the eye is a prominent slogan: “Voluntary Labor – The School of Revolutionary Tempering.”

Indeed, this is a great school that cultivates a new generation. In this school, which has been established for just one year, 36,000 male and female youths from various factories, mines, agricultural cooperatives, and schools across the country have undergone excellent labor and revolutionary tempering.

Remembering the Teachings of the Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha

The great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, once said at the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labor: “We must never forget that the communist education of the younger generation is carried out in the midst of sharp class struggle at home and abroad, especially in the complex and great ideological struggle.” “The youth should be engaged in various major activities, letting them be tempered in the school of labor and life.”

One year ago, the Albanian Youth Federation and the revolutionary youth across the country, following the teachings of Comrade Hoxha, bravely accepted the glorious task entrusted by the Party of Labor: to build the Logarçin-Fier railway, one of the major projects of the Fourth Five-Year Plan, through voluntary labor. After the Central Committee of the Youth Federation issued a resolution to launch this large-scale voluntary labor campaign, it received an extremely enthusiastic response from the youth across the country. Tens of thousands of youths rushed to sign up with various levels of the Youth Federation, expressing their eager desire to rush to the frontline of voluntary labor. In just twenty days, 116,000 people signed up.

The School of Labor

One year ago, this revolutionary school opened under the loving care of the Party of Labor. The youths, holding their labor tools, enthusiastically accepted the inspection of Comrade Shehu and other Party and government leaders, and began their first labor class.

Whether it was the severe cold of winter or the scorching heat of summer, from dawn to dusk, the enthusiastic labor youths swung their picks and shovels, blasted rocks, and transported soil, fighting day and night. Through the efforts of the voluntary laborers, the 54-kilometer-long railway line has now had 36 kilometers of track bed built, 29 kilometers of rails laid, and more than 100 bridges and culverts constructed.

To better educate the youths politically and ideologically, the engineering command center also organized visits to factories, enterprises, and agricultural cooperatives. Through participating in labor practice and visiting activities, the youths further understood the significance of labor. Some youths pointed to the calluses on their hands and said, “These calluses are good. They are an insurmountable barrier to revisionism!”

A Revolutionary Furnace

Over the past year, the youths in this revolutionary school have not only received labor education but also education in class struggle, patriotism, and socialism. While participating in the construction of the railway, they actively engaged in the nationwide movement to revolutionize people's thoughts and national life. The Party and the Youth Federation's grassroots organizations, during the youths' spare time, organized them to study many important documents since the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labor and Comrade Hoxha's programmatic speech on February 6 of last year. Many youths also linked their own families, schools, villages, and factories, holding lively discussions, and engaged in the struggle against religious superstition, backward customs, and the thorough liberation of women.

Among those who came to the construction site to work were cadres from various levels of the Party, Youth Federation, and Women's Federation, as well as teachers from schools. They ate, lived, worked, and studied with the youths and conducted political and ideological education work for them. Some old workers on the construction site and old soldiers who participated in the national independence and liberation wars were also good teachers for educating the youths in class struggle. The 102-year-old Grandpa Basho and the 82-year-old Grandpa Neri, who participated in the anti-Fascist guerrilla war, often told the youths about the bitter experiences of the Albanian people suffering from oppression and exploitation by foreign rulers, as well as by local feudal lords, landlords, and capitalists before liberation. They also told stories of the national independence and liberation wars. The youths also visited exhibitions in nearby villages comparing life before and after liberation, visited places where great communist fighters like Adam Reka fought, visited the families of martyrs, and visited the Party of Labor's founding memorial hall and the National Liberation War Museum.

Examples of Youth

Under the care, cultivation, and education of various levels of the Party and Youth Federation organizations, and through the hot labor and revolutionary tempering, many advanced collectives and individuals have emerged on the construction site over the past year.

Shkuta Vata, a 15-year-old girl from a poor peasant family in the Dukagjin region in the north, was the first to sign up to participate in the construction of the railway after Comrade Hoxha delivered the speech “Further Revolutionizing the Party and the Government” on February 6 last year. During her work on the construction site, she always took on the heaviest tasks and actively studied and propagated the Party's policies. In less than a month of labor, Shkuta was awarded the title of “Shock Worker” four times. In October last year, she was seriously injured during her work. She always remembered the teachings of the Party and Comrade Hoxha, and even on the hospital bed, her first concern was still the labor of her comrades. Finally, she died a glorious death due to her severe injuries.

Upon hearing the news, Shkuta's father, Pal Vata, turned his grief into strength, bringing his niece and another 15 young women from his village to the construction site. They picked up the pickaxe that Shkuta used and fought on the same post where Shkuta worked. Comrade Hoxha wrote a letter praising Shkuta and her father's high communist consciousness and revolutionary heroism. The Central Committee of the Party of Labor decided to posthumously recognize Shkuta as a member of the Party of Labor. All this greatly inspired the youth voluntary laborers on the entire construction site and the youth and people of Albania.

Many other selfless and heroic deeds have emerged on the construction site. The voluntary labor youths from the Berat region bravely jumped into the icy water to rescue the wooden materials for bridge construction that were washed away in the cold days. The voluntary labor youths from the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Tirana selflessly rescued the grain warehouse of the agricultural cooperative near the construction site that caught fire due to lightning. The blind Fato Cela and the one-armed Nikoll Leshi voluntarily came to the railway construction site to participate in voluntary labor. They demonstrated excellent qualities of bravery, perseverance, overcoming difficulties, loving labor, and loving the socialist motherland on the construction site, becoming examples for everyone to learn from.

Over the past year, this revolutionary school has trained many young cadres for the Party and the state. Many of them have become good cadres in their original units after returning. Over the past year, this revolutionary school has trained batch after batch of revolutionary youths and welcomed batch after batch of eager-to-progress newcomers. These young voluntary laborers, loyal to the Party and the people, have gathered from all corners of the Land of the Eagles, contributing their strength to the socialist construction of the motherland and being tempered; and then they go to various places, promoting the further development of the socialist revolution and socialist construction across the country. When these daring and victorious young soldiers leave, people recognize even more the brilliant image of this great socialist beacon in Europe.

    义务劳动——革命的大学校
    记阿尔巴尼亚青年义务劳动建设洛格齐恩—费里铁路一周年
    在阿尔巴尼亚西部工业城市费里以北大约五十多公里的公路沿线一带，千千万万青年义务劳动者正在加紧修建一条同公路大致平行的洛格齐恩—费里铁路。工地上呈现一片热气腾腾的劳动景象。
    走进工地义务劳动者总指挥部，首先映入眼帘的是一条引人注目的大标语：“义务劳动——革命锻炼的学校” 。
    的确，这是一所造就一代新人的大学校。在这所创办才一年的学校里，来自全国各工矿企业、农业生产合作社和学校的三万六千名男女青年，已经受到了一次很好的劳动和革命锻炼。
    牢记党和霍查同志的教导
    阿尔巴尼亚人民伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志曾经在劳动党第五次代表大会上说过：“我们任何时候都不能忘记，对青年一代的共产主义教育是在国内外尖锐的阶级斗争，特别是在复杂的、巨大的思想斗争的情况下进行的。”“应该使青年投入到各项重大的活动中去，让他们在劳动和生活的学校里受到锻炼。”
    一年前，阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟和全国广大革命青年根据霍查同志的这一教导，勇敢地接受了劳动党委托给他们的光荣任务：用义务劳动来建设第四个五年计划的巨大项目之一——洛格齐恩—费里铁路。劳动青年联盟中央发表开展这场大规模的义务劳动的决议后，得到了全国广大青年极其热烈的响应。成千上万的青年纷纷向劳动青年联盟各级组织报名，表达他们迫切要求奔赴义务劳动前线的决心。在短短的二十天里，就有十一万六千多人报了名。
        劳　动　大　学
    一年以前，这所革命的大学校在劳动党的亲切关怀下，胜利地“开学”了。青年们紧握手中的劳动工具，满腔热情地接受了谢胡同志等党和政府领导人的检阅，开始了劳动的第一课。
    不管是隆冬严寒还是炎夏酷暑，从清晨到傍晚，斗志旺盛的劳动青年在那里挥镐舞锨，炸石运土，日夜奋战。经过义务劳动者的努力奋战，五十四公里长的铁路线，现在已经打好了三十六公里路基，铺上了二十九公里铁轨，建成了一百多个桥梁和涵洞。
    为了更好地对青年进行政治思想教育，工程指挥部还为他们组织参观工厂企业和农业生产合作社等活动。通过亲自参加劳动实践和参观活动，青年们进一步认识了劳动的意义。有些青年指着手上长出的老茧说：“这老茧长得好，它是修正主义不可逾越的障碍！”
      革命的大熔炉
    一年来，青年们在这所革命的大学校里不仅受到了劳动教育，而且受到了阶级斗争、爱国主义和社会主义的教育。他们在参加修建铁路劳动的同时，积极投入正在全国蓬勃开展的人的思想和国家生活革命化的运动。劳动党和劳动青年联盟的基层组织在青年们劳动之余，组织他们学习劳动党第五次代表大会以来的许多重要文件和霍查同志去年二月六日的纲领性讲话等。许多青年还联系自己家庭、学校、农村和工厂的实际，开展热烈的讨论，投入了反对宗教迷信、落后习俗和彻底解放妇女的斗争。
    到工地参加劳动的人中间，还有各级党、劳动青年联盟和妇女联合会等组织的干部，学校的教员。他们同青年们同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习，并对青年进行政治思想教育工作。工地上的一些老工人和参加过民族独立和民族解放战争的老战士，也是对青年进行阶级教育的好教师。一百零二岁的巴绍老大爷和参加过反法西斯游击战争的八十二岁的乃里老大爷，经常给青年们讲解放前阿尔巴尼亚人民受外国统治者以及本国封建主、地主和资本家压迫和剥削的惨痛遭遇，讲民族独立和民族解放战争的故事。青年们还参观附近一些村子举办的解放前后生活对比的展览会，参观伟大的共产主义战士亚当·雷卡等革命烈士生前斗争过的地方，访问烈士家属，参观劳动党成立纪念馆和民族解放战争博物馆。
      青　年　的　榜　样
    在各级党和青年联盟组织的关怀、培养和教育下，在火热的劳动和革命锻炼中，一年来，在工地上涌现出许许多多先进的集体和个人。
    出身贫苦农民家庭的十五岁的女青年什库塔·瓦塔来自北方的杜卡杰尼地区。去年二月六日，霍查同志作了《党和政权的进一步革命化》的讲话以后，她在村里第一个报名参加建设铁路的义务劳动。在工地劳动中，她总是抢重活干，积极学习和宣传党的政策。在短短的不到一个月的劳动中，什库塔四次获得“突击手”称号。去年十月，她在劳动中受了重伤。她时刻牢记党和霍查同志的教导，就是在医院的病床上，她首先关心的还是同志们的劳动。最后，她因为伤势过重而光荣牺牲。
    什库塔的父亲帕尔·瓦塔闻讯后，化悲痛为力量，带着自己的侄女和本村另外十几名女青年来到工地，拿起女儿生前用过的镐，战斗在女儿工作过的岗位上。霍查同志曾写信赞扬了什库塔父女高度的共产主义觉悟和革命英雄主义精神。劳动党中央特作出决定，追认什库塔为阿尔巴尼亚劳动党党员。这一切极大地鼓舞了全工地的青年义务劳动者，鼓舞了全阿尔巴尼亚青年和人民。
    工地上还出现了许多舍己为公、英勇斗争的动人事迹。来自贝尔梅特区的义务劳动青年，在严寒的日子里，毅然跳入冰冷的水中抢救被冲走的建桥用的木料。来自地拉那大学工程系的义务劳动青年，忘我地抢救工地附近由于雷电起火的农业社粮仓。双目失明的弗阿特·采拉，失去一只胳膊的尼科尔·莱希，都志愿来到铁路工地参加义务劳动。他们在工地上表现了英勇顽强、排除万难、热爱劳动、热爱社会主义祖国的优秀品质，成为大家学习的榜样。
    一年来，这所革命的大学校为党和国家培养了许多青年干部。他们中间的许多人回到原单位后，成了本单位的好干部。
    一年来，这所革命的大学校培养了一批又一批革命青年，迎来了一批又一批勇于上进的新生。这些忠于党、忠于人民的青年义务劳动者，从山鹰之国的四面八方汇集到这里，把自己的力量贡献给祖国的社会主义建设事业并受到锻炼；又从这里分赴各地，促进全国社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业的进一步发展。当离开这些敢于战斗、敢于胜利的年青战士的时候，人们就更加认识到欧洲这盏伟大的社会主义明灯的光辉形象。　　新华社记者（附图片）
