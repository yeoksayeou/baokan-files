Palestinian guerrillas active in the Israeli-occupied areas have intensified their fighting over the past ten days, inflicting new blows on the Israeli aggressors.

According to a communiqué issued by the Palestinian underground nationalist organization "Fatah," in the counterattack against the Israeli invasion of Jordan on March 29, Palestinian commando units participated in the fighting, destroying a number of Israeli military outposts and two control points, one tank, and three half-track vehicles.

On the evening of March 24, the "Storm" commando units launched three simultaneous attacks on the West Bank of the Jordan River, killing 22 Israeli soldiers and destroying a large amount of enemy equipment.

In the village of Umm al-Zaytun, a group of "Storm" commandos laid mines that destroyed two enemy military vehicles, killing all seven occupants.

In the village of Umm al-Sharati, another group of commandos attacked enemy forces with rocket launchers and machine guns, destroying one half-track vehicle and one jeep, and killing 15 enemy soldiers.

A third group of "Storm" commandos attacked the Israeli invaders' camp in Kafr Lu, destroying one tank, two military vehicles, and one cannon.

According to reports from Cairo newspapers, on March 29, two enemy military vehicles were blown up by mines in the Hamah area south of Lake Tiberias, killing four Israeli soldiers and injuring two, one of whom was an American.

Another Palestinian guerrilla unit, from March 21 to 28, killed or wounded 12 Israeli soldiers in the Sarar Valley, Umm Sus, Tall al-Uwayma, and north of Jericho, and blew up several enemy military vehicles.

On March 25, Palestinian guerrillas engaged in combat with Israeli forces near the West Bank of the Jordan River, killing two Israeli officers.

The intensification of guerrilla warfare in the Israeli-occupied areas has caused concern among Israeli authorities.

An Israeli official spokesman admitted on March 25 that Palestinian guerrillas have been attacking Israeli forces with various weapons throughout the occupied areas.

Guerrillas have laid mines and conducted attacks on Israeli patrol lines in the Besan Valley, the Gaza Strip, and many other places.

In the Besan Valley, from March 21 to 25, guerrillas launched eleven attacks on some of Israel's important facilities.

The Israeli official spokesman acknowledged that Israel has suffered heavy losses in personnel and materiel.
