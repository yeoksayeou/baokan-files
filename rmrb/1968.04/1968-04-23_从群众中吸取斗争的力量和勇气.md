When I think of our beloved Chairman Mao, a warm current surges through my heart; when I recall the evil old society, a thousand grudges fill my chest. Before liberation, at the age of twenty-two, I started working on the trains. Because I sang revolutionary songs, I was arrested by the Kuomintang bandits and special agents as a suspected member of the Eighth Route Army. In the face of death, Zhangdian was liberated, and the comrades sent by Chairman Mao, the People's Liberation Army, rescued me. After liberation, with boundless love and gratitude for Chairman Mao, I resumed driving trains.

In 1958, I was elected from an ordinary Communist Party member to become a member of the Zhangdian Locomotive Section Party Committee, and then promoted from a driver to the position of chief and deputy section head. After becoming an official, I followed Chairman Mao's teachings on "We Communist Party members, no matter what problem we face, must be able to unite with the masses." I still spent eighty percent of my time in the workshop and on the locomotive, eating and working with the masses, ensuring the smooth operation of the locomotives.

In the great storms of the revolution, I stand heart to heart with the masses.

From the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, a handful of capitalist roaders within the Zhangdian Locomotive Section Party Committee, in order to shift the target of the struggle, focused on the "San Jia Village," "Si Jia Shop," "counter-revolutionaries," and "monsters and demons" among the masses. Nearly a quarter of the workers in the entire section were listed as key targets of struggle. I thought, since liberation, in every political movement led by Chairman Mao, not once have the revolutionary masses been treated as enemies. The "Sixteen Points" drafted under Chairman Mao's leadership point out, "The focus of this movement is to criticize those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road"; why then did they direct their arrows at the masses, especially at some old workers?

There were only sixteen old workers of the sixth and seventh grades in our section, and eight of them were labeled as "counter-revolutionaries." Take Li Chuanwen, for example. He is an old worker with over thirty years of experience in car repair, with boundless love for Chairman Mao. Yet, who would have thought that the capitalist roaders would incite the masses to label Li Chuanwen as a "black pillar" of the "San Jia Village"? I thought, now I have two paths before me: one is to turn a blind eye, close one eye, and go with the flow, not revealing my thoughts or stance, neither offending the masses nor going against the Party Committee, thus avoiding risks and troubles, achieving a win-win situation. The other is to stand firmly with the masses and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to the death. The former seems safe and sound, firmly grounded, a path to preserve one's name and benefits, but this would betray Mao Zedong Thought, abandon the Party's principles, and is the greatest selfishness, the greatest disloyalty to Chairman Mao. The latter involves risks, but as long as it can defend Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's principles, it is the greatest public spirit, a quality that a Communist Party member should have. Just as Chairman Mao teaches us: "A Communist Party member should be open-hearted, honest, active, putting revolutionary interests first, subordinating personal interests to revolutionary interests; at all times and in all places, upholding correct principles and tirelessly fighting against all incorrect thoughts and behaviors..."

Thinking of this, I actively approached those labeled as "monsters and demons" among the masses. Sometimes I invited them to my home to discuss the situation together. Sometimes I went to the workshop to encourage them to follow Chairman Mao closely. I often told them, "Rest assured, labeling you as 'counter-revolutionaries' is definitely not Chairman Mao's policy." To help those labeled as "counter-revolutionaries" discern right from wrong, uphold principles, and continue the struggle, I wrote out Chairman Mao's six criteria for distinguishing between flowers and weeds in large characters and publicly supported the revolutionary masses. This way, they often came to me for advice, and our class feelings became even closer.

With the support of the revolutionary masses, we counterattacked the counter-revolutionary restoration tide.

Inspired by the January Revolution storm, several revolutionary mass organizations in our section united to seize power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. When the "Provisional Management Committee" was established, the masses also invited me to participate.

Unexpectedly, just two days after the "Provisional Management Committee" was established, the entire Zibo region was engulfed in a counter-revolutionary restoration tide. The capitalist roaders in our locomotive section shouted, "Li Jingyu is the black hand behind the scenes." In a few days, they really struck, labeling the "Provisional Management Committee" as a "counter-revolutionary" organization and using the tools of dictatorship in their hands to arrest the responsible persons.

They pasted big-character posters attacking me from the canteen to the courtyard, labeling me with all sorts of crimes. That night, they notified me to go to the material warehouse to explain the issues. The capitalist roaders opened the meeting by forcing me to confess to "anti-Party conspiracies." I said, "The revolutionary rebels are acting openly and above board; those who plot in secret are not us but you." He then said, "You are a Party member and an administrative responsible person in the section, why are you mixing with 'monsters and demons' and 'counter-revolutionaries'?" I said, "Those who oppose Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line are the real counter-revolutionaries. Those who rise up in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to rebel against the bourgeois reactionary line are the proletarian revolutionaries, not 'monsters and demons' at all." Seeing that they couldn't extract anything, the capitalist roaders then convened all the cadres in the section, intending to accuse me of sabotaging production and fight me behind closed doors. I thought: You are so afraid of the masses during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and as soon as the mass movement comes, you throw down your tools and lie down without doing anything. So I sternly told them, "We are guilty of insisting on revolution and promoting production, but are you not guilty of throwing down your tools?" The capitalist roaders, feeling guilty and ashamed, mumbled for half a day without saying a word. At this moment, someone suddenly stood up and shouted loudly, "The direction of this meeting is completely wrong. Why are the capitalist roaders fighting Li Jingyu? We object to this and withdraw from your meeting!" I looked up and saw that it was Wang Dexue, a worker from the repair shop. This meeting was disrupted by him, and it ended in chaos, with everyone dispersing.

Such struggle meetings continued for more than a week, sometimes fighting me for a whole day and night. Meetings of cadres, masses, and expanded Party Committee meetings, they used every trick. Seeing that they couldn't make anything out of it, the capitalist roaders tried to find a way through my wife.

Abandoning personal desires, fighting alongside the masses to the end.

My wife has been bedridden for seven years due to tuberculosis. The situation of me being labeled as a "counter-revolutionary" and being fought against every day was hidden from her to avoid aggravating her condition. However, this situation was noticed by the capitalist roaders, and they tried to exploit it. One night, they sneaked into my home and, as soon as they entered, threatened, "Li Jingyu, the section has pasted so many big-character posters about you, and everyone is fighting against you. If you continue like this, you will be in great danger!" My wife heard this and her condition suddenly worsened, causing her to be restless all night. She said, "Don't meddle in this anymore. I am half-dead, half-alive. Just stop it!"

The patient was restless all night, and I didn't sleep either, my thoughts in turmoil. Finally, I made the wrong decision to withdraw from the "Provisional Management Committee."

As soon as I withdrew from the "Provisional Management Committee," the conservative forces were overjoyed. They took the opportunity to spread the word, saying things like, "Li Jingyu has withdrawn from the 'Provisional Management Committee,' the situation in the locomotive section is settled," "Monsters and demons and rightists, surrender," "Confess and you will be treated leniently, resist and you will be treated harshly," and so on. This made me realize that withdrawing from the "Provisional Management Committee" was a serious political mistake, a failure to withstand the test in the fierce class struggle.

On the fourth night after I withdrew from the "Provisional Management Committee," representatives from the revolutionary masses in the locomotive section came to my home. As soon as they entered, they said, "Comrade, these days they have confused you. We came to see you and study Chairman Mao's works with you." We sat down, holding Chairman Mao's sacred book, reading it line by line, reading it over and over again. As we read, we looked at Chairman Mao's portrait. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao, you taught us, "Thousands upon thousands of martyrs have sacrificed their lives for the people's interests in front of us, let us hold high their banner and march forward on their blood-stained path!"

I decided to fight alongside everyone, no longer considering family, wife, children, and other personal issues. Soon, a new revolutionary organization emerged, braving the counter-current and black wind.

At that time, although Zhangdian was still in the midst of the counter-revolutionary restoration tide, the capitalist roaders still controlled the tools of dictatorship and had weapons in their hands. However, in the face of the powerful revolutionary mass movement, they were like toads pressed under a stone, grinding their teeth and glaring with white eyes, puffing themselves up.

By June of last year, the entire Zibo City (including the Zhangdian area), under the warm care of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, under the direct leadership of the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee, and with the firm support of the People's Liberation Army, the counter-revolutionary restoration tide completely collapsed. Our locomotive section quickly achieved revolutionary great unity by class, and in October, the Revolutionary Committee was established. This was the first revolutionary temporary power organ established after the proletarian revolutionaries in Zibo City seized power.

From February to April of last year, although our section's revolutionary forces suffered serious setbacks, under the efforts of the broad revolutionary masses, we insisted on revolution and promoted production, completing the production and transportation and safety plans very well, creating a record of the fewest accidents in several years. This is the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the victory of Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production."

Through more than a year of tempering and testing in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I deeply feel that as a revolutionary cadre, no matter what the situation, no matter when, no matter how complex the problem, one must always keep Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in mind and never detach oneself from the masses.

I will definitely forever follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao, forever stand heart to heart with the masses, forever be a student of the masses, diligently serving the people as an "old yellow cow" for life, wholeheartedly serving the people.

    从群众中吸取斗争的力量和勇气
    青岛铁路分局张店机务段革命委员会负责人　李经裕
    想起我们心中的红太阳毛主席，一股暖流涌心头；忆起万恶的旧社会，千仇万恨满胸膛。解放前，我二十二岁就跑车，因为唱了革命歌曲，就被蒋匪狗特务当做八路军嫌疑犯逮进了监狱。在九死一生的关头，张店解放了，毛主席派来的亲人解放军把我救了出来。解放后，我怀着对毛主席无限热爱、无限感激的心情，又重新开起了火车。
    一九五八年，我从一个普通的共产党员，被推选为张店机务段的党委委员，又从司机长提拔为主任、副段长。在当了干部以后，我遵照毛主席关于“我们共产党员，无论在什么问题上，一定要能够同群众相结合”的教导，仍然保持百分之八十的时间在车间、火车头上，和群众同吃、同劳动，尽量做到保证机车顺利运行。
    在革命的大风大浪中和群众心连心
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命一开始，张店机务段前党委内一小撮走资派，为了转移斗争目标，在群众中大抓“三家村”、“四家店”、“反革命”、“牛鬼蛇神”，全段就有近四分之一的职工，被列为斗争重点。我想，解放后毛主席领导的历次政治运动，没有一次把革命群众当做敌人来对待，毛主席主持制定的“十六条”中指出“这次运动的重点，是整党内那些走资本主义道路的当权派”；而他们为什么把矛头对准了群众，特别是对准一些老工人呢？
    我们段上一共只有十六名六、七级工的老工人，被打成“反革命”的就有八名。拿李传文来说，他是有三十多年修车经验的老工人，对毛主席无限热爱。可是万万没有想到，走资派竟挑动群众把李传文打成了“三家村”的“黑老杆”。我想，现在摆在我面前有两条路：一条是睁一个眼，闭一个眼，随大流，不暴露思想，不表示态度，既不得罪群众，又不违背党委，这样可以不担风险，少惹是非，两全其美。另一条是坚决和群众站在一起，誓死捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。前一条看来四平八稳，牢牢靠靠，是保名、保利的路，但是这样做就违背了毛泽东思想，放弃了党的原则，这是最大的私，是对毛主席最大的不忠。后一条要担风险，但只要能捍卫毛泽东思想，捍卫党的原则，就是最大的公，这是一个共产党员应有的品质。正象毛主席所教导我们的：“一个共产党员，应该是襟怀坦白，忠实，积极，以革命利益为第一生命，以个人利益服从革命利益；无论何时何地，坚持正确的原则，同一切不正确的思想和行为作不疲倦的斗争……”
    想到这里，我就主动地和那些被打成“牛鬼蛇神”的群众接近，有时候让他们到我家里来，一块研究情况。有时我到车间去鼓励他们要紧跟毛主席。我常对他们说：“你们放心吧，把你们打成‘反革命’，这决不是毛主席的政策。”为了帮助那些被打成“反革命”的同志明辨是非，坚持原则，继续斗争，我就把毛主席识别香花毒草的六条标准用大字报写了出去，公开支持革命群众。这样一来，他们就经常来找我商量，我和群众之间的阶级感情更加亲密了。
    在革命群众支持下反击反革命复辟逆流
    在一月革命风暴的鼓舞下，我们段几个革命群众组织联合起来夺了党内一小撮走资派的权。在成立张店机务段“临管会”的时候，群众也吸收我参加了。
    没想到“临管会”成立刚刚两天，整个淄博地区就出现了一股反革命复辟逆流。我们机务段的走资派大喊大叫地说：“李经裕是在幕后操纵的黑后台。”不几天，他们真的下了毒手，将“临管会”打成“反革命”组织。并利用他们掌握的专政工具，逮捕了负责人。
    他们又从食堂到大院，全贴上了攻击我的大字报，什么罪名都给我加上了。当天晚上，他们通知我到材料库交代问题。走资派开头第一句话就是逼着我交代“反党阴谋”。我说：“革命造反派正大光明，搞阴谋的不是我们而是你们。”他又说：“你是一个党员，是段上的行政负责人，为什么和‘牛鬼蛇神’‘反革命’混在一起？”我说：“反对毛主席无产阶级革命路线的，才是真正的反革命。在无产阶级文化大革命中起来造资产阶级反动路线反的，是无产阶级革命派，根本不是什么‘牛鬼蛇神’。”走资派看抠不出东西来，接着召集了段上的全体干部，想以破坏生产的罪名关起门来斗我。我想：你们在无产阶级文化大革命中怕群众怕得要死，群众运动一来你们就撂挑子躺倒不干。于是我就严厉地对他们说：“我们坚持抓革命促生产有罪，难道你们撂挑子有功！”走资派心虚理亏，嘴里嘟嘟囔囔半天没说出话来。这时候突然有人站起来大声喊道：“你们开的这个会大方向完全错了，为什么走资派斗争李经裕，我们不同意，我们坚决提出抗议，并退出你们的会场。”我抬头一看，原来是检修车间的工人王德华。这个会被他这样一冲，整个会场全乱了，会开的没头没尾，就一哄而散。
    这样的斗争会一连搞了一个多星期，有时还连续斗我一天一宿。干部会、群众会、党委扩大会，什么招都使了。走资派看捣咕不出个名堂来，又想从我爱人身上打主意。
    抛掉私心杂念同群众一起战斗到底
    我爱人患肺结核已经卧床七年了。我被打成“反革命”、天天挨斗的情况一直瞒着她，为的是怕加重她的病情。可是这个情况却被走资派瞅上了，他们想从这里打开缺口。一天晚上，他们鬼鬼祟祟来到我家，一进门劈头就威胁说：“李经裕，段上给你贴了这么多大字报，大家斗了你，你再这样下去就很危险了！”我爱人听了这话，病情突然加重了，整整闹了一宿。她说：“你别去捣咕这个了，我病得半死不活的，快算了吧！” 
    病人闹了一宿，我一夜也没睡，思想在激烈地斗争。最后，我作出了错误的决定，退出了“临管会”。
    我一退出“临管会”，保守势力高兴了。他们就趁机大造舆论，说什么：“李经裕退出‘临管会’了，机务段的大局定了”，什么“牛鬼蛇神和右派自首吧”，什么“坦白从宽，抗拒从严”啦等等。这一来，我发觉了自己退出“临管会”是一个严重的政治性错误，是在激烈的阶级斗争面前没有经受住考验。
    我退出“临管会”的第四个晚上，机务段的革命群众派了代表到我家来了。他们一进门就说：“老伙计，这两天他们把你斗糊涂了，我们来看你，来和你一块学习毛主席著作。”我们坐下来手捧毛主席的宝书，一字一句地读，读一遍又一遍，一边读，一边望着毛主席像，毛主席，毛主席，您老人家教导我们：“成千成万的先烈，为着人民的利益，在我们的前头英勇地牺牲了，让我们高举起他们的旗帜，踏着他们的血迹前进吧！”
    我决心和大家一起战斗下去，不再考虑家庭、老婆、孩子等个人问题了。不久，一个新的革命组织就顶着逆流和黑风杀出来了。
    那时，张店虽然还是处在反革命复辟逆流中，走资派还掌握着专政工具，手里还有武装。但在强大的革命群众运动面前，他们好象压在石头底下的癞蛤蟆，气得咯吱咯吱的咬牙，白瞪着两只眼干鼓气。
    到了去年六月份，整个淄博市（包括张店地区），在毛主席、党中央的亲切关怀下，在山东省革委会的直接领导下，在人民解放军的坚决支持下，反革命复辟逆流全面崩溃了。我们机务段很快地实现了按班组的革命大联合，十月份又成立了革委会。这是淄博市无产阶级革命派掌权后成立的第一个革命的临时权力机构。
    去年二至四月份，虽然我们段上革命力量受到严重挫折，但在广大革命群众的努力下，坚持抓革命，促生产，使生产运输、安全计划完成得都很好，创造了几年来事故最少的纪录。这是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的胜利，是毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针的胜利。
    经过一年多来无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼和考验，我深深地体会到，作为一个革命干部，无论在什么情况下，无论在什么时候，无论遇到多么复杂的问题，都要在头脑里牢记毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，千万千万不要脱离群众。
    我一定永远按照毛主席指引的道路，永远和群众心连心，永远做群众的小学生，勤勤恳恳地为人民当一辈子“老黄牛”，全心全意为人民服务。
