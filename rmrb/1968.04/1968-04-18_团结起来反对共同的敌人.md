At a time when the broad masses of black people in the United States have launched an unprecedented struggle against violence in American history, our great leader Chairman Mao issued the "Statement in Support of the Black People's Struggle Against Violence in the United States." This statement is not only a great concern, support, and encouragement for our black brothers in the United States but also for all oppressed nations and peoples around the world.

In the statement, Chairman Mao points out: "The contradiction between the broad masses of black people in the United States and the ruling class of the United States is a class contradiction." U.S. imperialism is facing deep political and economic crises. The U.S. ruling class is in a state of internal and external difficulties, and their days are very hard. To serve the monopoly capital of the United States, the Johnson administration is on the one hand stepping up external aggression and expansion, and on the other hand, pushing forward the so-called "national austerity plan" to plunder the poor and enrich the rich, desperately shifting the deepening economic crisis onto the laboring people of the United States, especially the black brothers. The broad masses of black people in the United States suffer the most from the oppression and exploitation of the monopoly bourgeoisie, have the deepest grievances, and the deepest hatred, and therefore their resistance is the strongest. The struggle of black people in the United States against violence is a sharp class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the United States.

However, U.S. imperialism attempts to cover up the essence of class struggle by using the racial issue to divide the ranks of the American proletariat and deceive the black brothers. In fact, they are not playing any new tricks. All imperialists and reactionaries in the world are accustomed to using such tricks.

We old workers in Tianjin deeply understand that all exploiting classes are of the same ilk, and all proletarians are "bitter gourds on the same vine." The struggle of black people in the United States is not a struggle between black and white people but a class struggle.

The line between revolution and counter-revolution has never been drawn by skin color or race but by class. For a long time, the U.S. reactionary ruling class has created racial prejudice and hatred among laboring people of different skin colors to divide and rule, in order to maintain the reactionary rule of the monopoly bourgeoisie. Our great leader Chairman Mao has exposed the evil plot of U.S. imperialism and wisely pointed out: "The broad masses of black people in the United States and the broad laboring people among the white people in the United States have common interests and common struggle goals." This points out the great direction for the common struggle of the laboring people of all nationalities in the United States.

Our great leader Chairman Mao's "Statement in Support of the Black People's Struggle Against Violence in the United States" speaks the words in the hearts of the 700 million Chinese people. We, the workers, peasants, and revolutionary people of the world, regardless of skin color, will unite more closely, fight together, and overthrow U.S. imperialism, overthrow Soviet revisionism, and overthrow the reactionaries of all countries!

    团结起来反对共同的敌人
    天津市麻纺织厂工人　周国良　董兆惠　时际华
    正当美国的广大黑人群众掀起了美国历史上前所未有的抗暴斗争的时候，我们伟大的领袖毛主席发表了《支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明》，这不仅是对美国黑人兄弟，也是对全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民的巨大关怀、巨大支持和巨大鼓舞。
    毛主席在声明中指出：“美国广大黑人同美国统治集团之间的矛盾，是阶级矛盾。”美帝国主义面临着深刻的政治危机和经济危机，美国统治集团陷于内外交困，日子非常难过。为了给美国垄断资本效劳，约翰逊政府一面加紧对外侵略扩张，一面又抛出了“劫贫济富”的所谓“全民节约计划”，拚命把日益加深的经济危机转嫁给美国的劳动人民，特别是美国的黑人兄弟。广大的美国黑人受垄断资产阶级的压迫和剥削最重，苦最大，仇最深，因此反抗也就最强烈。美国黑人的抗暴斗争，就是美国无产阶级同资产阶级之间的尖锐的阶级斗争。
    但是，美帝国主义妄想掩盖阶级斗争的实质，利用种族问题来分化美国无产阶级队伍，蒙蔽美国的黑人兄弟。其实，他们耍的并不是什么新花招。世界上一切帝国主义和反动派都是惯用这种诡计的。
    我们天津的老工人深刻懂得，天下的剥削阶级都是一鼻孔出气的，天下的无产阶级是“一条藤上的苦瓜”。美国黑人斗争，决不是黑人同白人之间的斗争，而是阶级斗争。
    革命与反革命的阵线，从来不是以肤色人种来划分的，而是以阶级来划分的。长期以来，美国反动统治集团，在不同肤色的劳动人民之间制造种族偏见和仇恨，借以分而治之，以便维护垄断资产阶级的反动统治。我们伟大领袖毛主席一针见血地揭穿了美帝国主义这一罪恶阴谋，并英明地指出：“美国广大黑人同美国白人中的广大劳动人民，有着共同的利益和共同的斗争目标。”指明了美国各族劳动人民共同斗争的大方向。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席《支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明》，说出了七亿中国人民心坎里的话。我们全世界的工人、农民和革命人民，不分肤色，更紧密地团结起来，共同对敌，打倒美帝，打倒苏修，打倒各国反动派！
