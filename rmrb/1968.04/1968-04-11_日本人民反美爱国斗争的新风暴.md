The waves of spring surge, and the sea of Japan roars!

Since the beginning of this year, the Japanese people have launched a new storm of anti-American patriotism. The struggle against the docking of U.S. nuclear aircraft carriers in Japanese ports, the struggle against the construction of U.S. military bases, the great strike by Japanese National Railway workers, the strike by workers at U.S. bases in Japan—these struggles have been incessant and unyielding. Recently, several thousand patriotic workers and students in Tokyo have held multiple demonstrations and marches to oppose the construction of a new field hospital by the U.S. forces in Japan, further escalating this anti-American tide.

In these struggles, the Japanese people have raised a clear anti-American banner and set forth clear objectives, dealing a powerful blow to the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries.

In these struggles, workers, peasants, students, women, and citizens have actively participated, marking the continuous expansion of the patriotic united front of all classes of the Japanese people against U.S. imperialism's aggression, oppression, and control.

In these struggles, the Japanese people, facing the bayonets and armored vehicles, water cannons, and tear gas of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, have fearlessly confronted the fascist police, displaying an indomitable will and heroic spirit in their anti-American patriotism.

U.S. imperialism has always used Japan as its base for aggression in Asia and has used the Japanese reactionaries, who sell out the interests of the Japanese nation, as its lackeys. The national and class contradictions between the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and the Japanese people are irreconcilable. Due to its heavy losses in the Vietnam War and the need to escalate its aggression, U.S. imperialism must further strengthen Japan's role as a base for aggression. The Sato government, which slavishly follows U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression, will inevitably work even harder for its master. In recent months, the Sato government has, with "unprecedented vigor," accelerated its militarization and war preparations, building military airfields for U.S. forces in Vietnam, constructing new field hospitals, and further turning Japan into a direct military base for U.S. aggression against Vietnam. At the same time, it has intensified its suppression of the Japanese people. This cannot but further sharpen the national and class contradictions between the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and the Japanese people, and cannot but make the Japanese people's anti-American patriotism more intense.

In the face of the intensifying national and class contradictions between the Japanese people and U.S. imperialism, the treacherous nature of the Revisionist group led by Kobayashi has been further exposed. It colludes closely with the Soviet revisionist traitors, doing its utmost to betray the revolutionary cause of the Japanese people and sabotage the Japanese people's anti-American patriotism. The Kobayashi group shouts empty slogans of "revolution" while wielding big sticks, shamelessly abusing the demonstrators as "hooligans," and helping the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries suppress the Japanese people's anti-American patriotism. Therefore, to oppose the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, one must also oppose the Soviet revisionist group and the Kobayashi group. Only by eliminating the poison of modern revisionism and smashing the sabotage activities of modern revisionism can the Japanese people's anti-American patriotism advance to victory.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "The Japanese nation is a great nation. It will never allow U.S. imperialism to ride roughshod over it for long." "The Japanese people will certainly be able to drive the U.S. imperialists out of their country, and the Japanese people's desire for independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality will certainly be realized."

The fate of Japan is not decided by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries or by the Soviet and Kobayashi revisionist groups, but by the awakened broad masses of the Japanese revolutionary people. The U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and all other demons and monsters will ultimately be buried by the Japanese people!

    日本人民反美爱国斗争的新风暴
    本报评论员
    春潮激荡，日本海在怒吼！
    今年以来，日本人民掀起了反美爱国斗争的新风暴。反对美国核航空母舰进驻日本港口的斗争，反对修建美军基地的斗争，日本国营铁路工人的大罢工，美军基地日本工人的罢工，此伏彼起，连绵不断。最近，东京几千名爱国工人和学生，为反对驻日美军在日本新建野战医院，举行了多次示威游行，又把这一反美浪潮推向进一步的高涨。
    在这些斗争中，日本人民高举鲜明的反美旗帜，提出了明确的斗争目标，给美日反动派以有力的打击。
    在这些斗争中，有工人、农民、学生、妇女、市民的积极参加，标志着日本各阶层人民反对美帝国主义侵略、压迫和控制的爱国统一战线正在不断扩大。
    在这些斗争中，日本人民面对美日反动派的刺刀和装甲车，水龙和瓦斯弹，不畏强暴，不怕牺牲，同法西斯警察展开了英勇搏斗，表现了反美爱国的坚强意志和英雄气概。
    美帝国主义一直把日本作为它在亚洲进行侵略的基地，把出卖日本民族利益的日本反动派作为它的走卒。美日反动派同日本人民之间的民族矛盾和阶级矛盾是不可调和的。美帝国主义由于在侵越战争中遭到了惨重的失败，由于要加紧扩大侵略战争，就必然要更加强日本这个侵略基地的作用。死心塌地追随美帝国主义侵略政策的佐藤政府，也就必然更加卖力地为它的主子效劳。近几个月来，佐藤政府更“以空前的劲头”加紧扩军备战，为侵越美军修建军用机场，新建野战医院，把日本进一步变为美国侵略越南的直接的军事基地，同时更变本加厉地镇压日本人民。这就不能不使美日反动派同日本人民的民族矛盾和阶级矛盾进一步尖锐，就不能不使日本人民的反美爱国斗争更加激烈。
    在日本人民同美帝国主义的民族矛盾和日本国内阶级矛盾日益激化的情况下，宫本修正主义集团的叛徒面目就更进一步地暴露出来。它同苏修叛徒集团加紧勾结，竭力出卖日本人民的革命事业，破坏日本人民的反美爱国斗争。宫本集团嘴里空喊“革命”，手里却抡起大棒，无耻地辱骂示威群众是什么“暴徒”，帮助美日反动派扼杀日本人民的反美爱国斗争。因此，要反对美日反动派，就必须反对苏修集团和宫本集团。只有肃清现代修正主义的流毒，粉碎现代修正主义的破坏活动，才能使日本人民的反美爱国斗争胜利地向前发展。
    我们伟大的导师毛主席指出：“日本民族是一个伟大的民族。它是绝不会让美帝国主义长期骑在自己头上的。”“日本人民一定能够把美帝国主义者从自己的国土上驱逐出去，日本人民要求独立、民主、和平、中立的愿望，一定能够实现。”
    决定日本命运的，绝不是美日反动派，也不是苏修和宫本修正主义集团，而是觉醒了的日本广大的革命人民。美日反动派及其它一切妖魔鬼怪，到头来统统要被日本人民所埋葬！
