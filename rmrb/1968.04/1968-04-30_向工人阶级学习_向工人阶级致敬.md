    Learn from the Working Class and Salute the Working Class
    The working class of our country listens to Chairman Mao the most and carries out his instructions the most resolutely. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have followed the great strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao and won victory after victory.

    Chairman Mao issued the great battle call to "bombard the headquarters," and the working class took the lead, bombarding China's Khrushchev and his agents in various regions and enterprises with countless cannons. With great heroism, they resolutely defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

    Chairman Mao called for "grasping the revolution and promoting production," and the working class took up the heavy responsibilities of revolution and production without hesitation. The revolutionary workers on the Changjiang River's Wuxia Gorge navigation route ensured that "signals never stop and beacons never rest" under any circumstances, guiding ships safely through rapids and shoals; the railway workers in Hengyang foiled the sabotage plots of class enemies, ensuring the normal operation of train after train; the workers at the Nanchang General Machinery Factory, with one person doing the work of several, ensured that "machines run day and night without stopping, and production increases month by month."...

    Chairman Mao advocated "frugality for revolution," and the working class carried it out resolutely. The workers of the Ping'an Mine Lamp Group in the Fuxin Mining Bureau checked and repaired nearly three hundred dim mine lamps by themselves. This not only saved the country a sum of money, but more importantly, carried forward the glorious tradition of thrift and frugality of the working class.

    "Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman, carrying out the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." It is precisely because the broad masses of revolutionary workers are infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, loyal to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line with their red hearts that they have created these outstanding achievements.

    We hereby express our highest respect to the revolutionary workers who have been steadfastly guarding their production posts to win a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    向工人阶级学习  向工人阶级致敬
    我国工人阶级，最听毛主席的话，最坚决地按照毛主席指示办事。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，他们紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的伟大战略部署，夺取了一个又一个的胜利。
    毛主席发出“炮打司令部”的伟大战斗号召，工人阶级一马当先，万炮齐轰中国赫鲁晓夫及其在各地区各企业单位的代理人。他们以大无畏的英雄气概，坚决捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线！
    毛主席号召“抓革命，促生产”，工人阶级毫不犹豫地挑起革命、生产两副重担。川江巫峡的革命航道工人，在任何困难情况下都保证“信号不停、标艇不息”，指引行船安全通过急流险滩；衡阳铁路工人粉碎阶级敌人的破坏阴谋，保证一列列火车正常运行；南昌通用机械厂的工人，一人顶几人，保证了“车床天天运转不停，生产月月向上”。……
    毛主席提出“要节约闹革命”，工人阶级坚决照办。阜新矿务局平安矿六井矿灯小组的工人，自己动手检查并修复了近三百个不亮的矿灯。这不仅为国家节约了一笔开支，更重要的是发扬了工人阶级勤俭节约的光荣传统。
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想”。广大革命工人正是靠着无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席，忠于战无不胜的毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的颗颗红心，创造这些优异成绩的。
    我们谨向为了夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利而坚守生产岗位的革命工人们，致以崇高的敬意！
