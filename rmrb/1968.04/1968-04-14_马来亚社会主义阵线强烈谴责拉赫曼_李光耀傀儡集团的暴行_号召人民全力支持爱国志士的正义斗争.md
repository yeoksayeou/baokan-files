The Malayan People's Socialist Front recently issued a statement in Singapore, strongly condemning the long-term illegal detention and persecution of political prisoners in Malaya (including Singapore) by the Rahman-Lee Kuan Yew puppet regime.

The statement said that the Rahman-Lee Kuan Yew puppet regime, acting as lackeys of American and British imperialism, has long suppressed the liberation struggle of the Malayan people, arbitrarily arresting anti-imperialist patriots and imprisoning them in concentration camps for extended periods. Many patriots have been detained for over ten years. In the Perak state's Taiping concentration camp, the Johor state's Muar concentration camp, and in Singapore's Changi and Queenstown prisons, anti-imperialist patriots are subjected to savage torture and abuse every day.

The statement said that the Rahman puppet regime has recently escalated its persecution of detained anti-imperialist patriots, provoking their brave resistance. Patriots in the Taiping concentration camp have been on a hunger strike since March 25. The reactionary authorities not only refused their legitimate demands but also brutally suppressed and arrested forty family members who went to Taiping to visit their relatives on March 29.

The statement demands that the Rahman-Lee Kuan Yew puppet regime immediately stop all fascist persecution of detained anti-imperialist patriots in Malaya (including Singapore) and unconditionally release them all, along with their arrested family members.

The statement calls on the people of Malaya to unite and fully support the patriots' just struggle. The statement points out that all reactionaries who collude with American and British imperialism to suppress the people will meet a bad end.

According to newspaper reports, recently in Kuala Lumpur, Penang, and other regions, Malayan masses have held demonstrations and marches, and written slogans, strongly protesting against the reactionary authorities' persecution of patriots and resolutely supporting the patriots' hunger strike.
