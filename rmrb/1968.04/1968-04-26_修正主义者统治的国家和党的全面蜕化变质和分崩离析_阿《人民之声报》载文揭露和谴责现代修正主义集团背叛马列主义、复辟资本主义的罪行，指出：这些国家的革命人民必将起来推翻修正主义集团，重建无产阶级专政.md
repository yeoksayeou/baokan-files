Albanian "People's Voice" Exposes and Condemns the Crimes of Modern Revisionist Groups in Betraying Marxism-Leninism and Restoring Capitalism, Pointing Out: The Revolutionary People of These Countries Will Rise Up to Overthrow the Revisionist Groups and Restore the Dictatorship of the Proletariat

New China News Agency, Tirana, April 25

The Albanian newspaper "People's Voice" recently published an article exposing and condemning the crimes of modern revisionist groups in betraying Marxism-Leninism and restoring capitalism in the countries they rule. The article also points out that the revolutionary people of these countries will rise up to overthrow the revisionist groups and restore the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The article, titled "The Complete Degeneration and Disintegration of the State and Party Ruled by Revisionists," states that the revisionists led by Khrushchev, Tito, and others have nothing in common with Marxism-Leninism. They have not a single trace of communist thought but are traitors to the proletariat and the communist cause. Our party's documents and articles in our country's newspapers have fully proven with numerous facts that the Khrushchev revisionists have betrayed the basic principles and doctrines of Marxism-Leninism in all fields, including ideology, politics, economics, and culture. Because modern revisionists have deviated from the communist position, the parties and socialist systems in the countries ruled by revisionist parties have completely degenerated. The parties have become bourgeois parties, and these countries' socialist systems are increasingly characterized by capitalist-bourgeois features.

The article points out that the essence of the modern revisionists' transformation of the socialist economy into capitalism is to gradually turn socialist ownership into a special form of capitalist ownership, serving the newly formed bourgeoisie to enrich themselves. The new bourgeoisie seizes political power and pursues anti-socialist and counter-revolutionary domestic and foreign policies. From a social perspective, the main purpose of all economic reforms by revisionists is to consolidate the position of the new bourgeoisie, increase their rights in the management of "social" ownership, make them the true bosses of so-called "socialist" enterprises, and create favorable conditions for them to continuously reap greater profits by exploiting the working people.

The article points out that in the countries ruled by revisionists, the number of people directly engaged in private activities in the economic field is increasing. Many of them have established private enterprises and workshops to produce various commodities. Some have set up private agencies to undertake urban and rural construction projects. Some have opened private shops, restaurants, and hotels, or engaged in various commercial speculation activities. Particularly, some are engaged in large-scale speculation in food, cars, apartments, and imported goods. Thus, a real black market has emerged, with prices far exceeding official prices. Brokers and smugglers are rampant.

Private activities are not only developing on a large scale in illegal forms but are also encouraged by the state in almost all revisionist countries. Private industries, handicrafts, and commerce are obviously being restored.

The article states that in these revisionist countries, the polarization in rural areas is proceeding rapidly, and the rich peasant class has developed and consolidated significantly. This polarization is guaranteed and encouraged by the laws of revisionist countries, which allow rich peasants to freely purchase land from poor peasants, exploit hired labor, and obtain various agricultural loans and equipment from the state.

The revisionists' capitalist restoration policies have made the burden of the working masses, especially the working class, increasingly heavy. The most obvious reflection of this burden is the continuous rise in prices of various commodities, especially food prices.

In the development of the economy, the implementation of revisionist lines, and the integration of the economy into capitalist tracks, the inevitable result is the emergence of various miserable characteristics of capitalist economic development: unemployment, anarchic production, and competition. Therefore, revisionists face many great difficulties. Even in the economic relations between revisionist countries, especially within the framework of the Economic Mutual Assistance Council, these difficulties have emerged.

In exposing the economic collusion between the revisionist-ruled countries like the Soviet Union and imperialism and international bourgeoisie, the article states that the revisionists' betrayal path cannot but make the revisionist-ruled countries' economic relations with international bourgeoisie more intimate. This path will further integrate these countries' economies into the tracks of the world capitalist economy, making their economies subject to the changes and crises of world capitalism.

The article points out that in the fields of culture, art, morality, and lifestyle in the countries ruled by revisionists, there is a sharp turn towards bourgeois degeneration. The changes in cultural life and lifestyle in the Soviet Union and other revisionist-ruled countries are increasingly difficult to distinguish from those in Western capitalist countries.

The promotion of egoism, individualism, bourgeois humanism and pacifism, and the slander of socialist ideological categories have replaced revolutionary art that propagates communist ideas.

In the countries ruled by revisionists, while spreading bourgeois decadent culture, they are also increasingly opening the door to poison people with religious opium. Religious ideas and church activities are re-emerging everywhere. According to statistics published by Soviet newspapers themselves, the number of religious ceremonies held across the Soviet Union has doubled or tripled in the past decade.

The article states that from these facts alone, one can clearly see the kind of ideological education the broad masses, especially the youth, are receiving. It is no wonder that in the countries ruled by revisionists, there are still widespread shocking acts of hooliganism and criminal activities.

The article states that the Khrushchev revisionists allow moral decay, spread bourgeois ideas and religious beliefs extensively, and strive to eliminate all revolutionary influences among the working masses, striving to degenerate the working class and youth ideologically, so as to more freely carry out their treacherous plot to restore capitalism.

The article further points out that the Khrushchev revisionists, on their path of betrayal, have eliminated all Marxist-Leninist and revolutionary elements within the parties they control. These parties have become bourgeois parties, becoming parties of the bourgeois reformist category. The ideological and political degeneration of revisionists is also reflected in the organizational disintegration of these parties, which have completely abandoned the Leninist principles and norms of party life.

Since the revisionists seized the leadership of the party and state in the Soviet Union and other countries, they have taken a series of measures to purge revolutionary cadres from the leadership at all levels, from central to local, and replace them with people loyal to the revisionist line.

The changes in the lower-level party organizations are even greater. The number of workers and collective farm members in these party organizations has significantly decreased, and now these organizations are filled with technicians and experts. In fact, these organizations have completely fallen into the hands of Soviet bureaucrats and ruling technicians, that is, into the hands of the privileged class that rules the Soviet Union today.

The article states that revisionists are doing everything possible to eliminate the class nature of the party. Such a "people's" party is more convenient for them to achieve their treacherous goals.

The revisionists have opened the doors of the party to bourgeois elements, petty-bourgeois elements, careerists, and bureaucrats.

All Leninist principles have been trampled upon, and all norms that should guide the party and the proletariat have been destroyed, resulting in the inevitable destruction of unity. Therefore, the revisionist party is definitely not united. Lack of unity, endless arguments, and numerous contradictions are increasingly exposed, even within the revisionist leadership groups of various countries. A series of facts known to world public opinion prove this situation.

The article states that the existence of such disagreements and quarrels within the revisionist leadership groups, as well as the struggle for power without principles, is not only related to the personalism, selfishness, and nationalism of the revisionist ideological field but also to the notorious failures of the revisionist line in all aspects. The existence of these situations is the result of the resistance and struggle of the revolutionary people of these countries and the great principled struggle of Marxist-Leninist parties to expose the revisionist betrayal, which makes the revisionists at a loss, forcing them to constantly change their strategies, methods, and processes of evolution.

The article points out that to maintain their rule, the revisionist groups, like all rulers, have extensively used both soft and hard methods to suppress the resistance of the revolutionary people and the dissatisfaction of the masses. On the one hand, these revisionist groups are doing their utmost to spread falsehoods to deceive and mislead the masses, to peddle the revisionist betrayal as creative Marxism-Leninism, to peddle the restoration of capitalism as "democratic" socialism to the masses, to suppress their awakening and erode their will, so that they do not take revolutionary actions; on the other hand, these revisionist groups are taking brutal repression measures to suppress anyone who dares to resist them. These people are arrested, detained, imprisoned in concentration camps, or declared "mentally ill" and sent to mental hospitals for "treatment."

The article concludes that despite the revisionists' use of deception and various repression measures, resistance and struggle against the revisionists are strengthening and will inevitably continue to strengthen. This resistance and struggle will increasingly take more organized forms and inevitably turn into a real revolution, overthrowing the traitorous revisionist leadership groups and driving them from power. The working class in the countries ruled by revisionists will awaken, understand the cruel reality, stand at the forefront of all working people, join the battle, and deal a fatal blow to the revisionist groups to defend socialism and restore the dictatorship of the proletariat.

    修正主义者统治的国家和党的全面蜕化变质和分崩离析
    阿《人民之声报》载文揭露和谴责现代修正主义集团背叛马列主义、复辟资本主义的罪行，指出：这些国家的革命人民必将起来推翻修正主义集团，重建无产阶级专政
    新华社地拉那二十五日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》最近发表文章，揭露和谴责现代修正主义集团背叛马克思列宁主义、在它们统治的国家里复辟资本主义的罪行，并且指出，这些国家的革命人民必将起来推翻修正主义集团，重建无产阶级专政。
    这篇题为《修正主义者统治的国家和党的全面蜕化变质和分崩离析》的文章说，赫鲁晓夫修正主义分子、铁托修正主义分子和其他修正主义分子都同马克思列宁主义毫无共同之处，他们没有一丝一毫的共产主义思想，而是背叛了无产阶级和共产主义事业的叛徒。我们党的各种文件以及我国报刊的文章，已经用无数事实全面论证和完全证明了赫鲁晓夫修正主义分子在意识形态、政治、经济和文化等一切领域中，都背叛了马克思列宁主义的基本原理和学说。由于现代修正主义者背离了共产主义的立场，因此在修正主义党掌权的那些国家里的党和社会主义制度已经完全蜕化变质，党变成了资产阶级的党，这些国家的社会主义制度日益具有资本主义——资产阶级制度的各种特点。
    文章指出，现代修正主义者使社会主义经济朝着资本主义蜕化变质的实质，就是使社会主义所有制逐渐变成一种特殊形式的资本主义所有制，为已经形成的新资产阶级发财致富服务，新资产阶级把政权掌握在自己手中，并奉行反社会主义和反革命的内外政策。从社会的观点来看，修正主义者的一切经济改革的主要目的，恰恰在于巩固这个新资产阶级的阵地，在“社会”所有制的管理方面增加新资产阶级的权利，使它成为所谓“社会主义”企业的真正的老板，为它创造有利的条件，以便它在剥削劳动人民的基础上不断捞取越来越大的利润。
    文章指出，在修正主义者统治的国家里，在经济领域中直接从事私人活动的整个阶层的人数越来越多。他们中间许多人建立了私人企业和车间，来生产各种商品。有些人设立了招揽城乡建筑工程的私人机构。有些人还开设私人的商店、饭馆和旅馆，或者做买卖以及进行各种商业投机活动。尤其是有人还大搞食品、小轿车、公寓和进口商品的投机倒把活动。因此就出现了一个真正的黑市，其价格远远超过了官价。
    掮客和走私者到处流窜。
    私人活动不仅正以非法的形式在大规模地发展，而且几乎在所有的修正主义国家里得到国家的鼓励，私人性质的工业、手工业和商业正在明显地得到恢复。
    文章说，在这些修正主义国家里，农村的两极分化当然是在急剧地进行，富农阶层得到了明显的发展和巩固。这种分化的发展得到修正主义国家法律的保障和鼓励，它们的法律允许富农分子自由购买贫苦农民的土地，剥削雇工并获得国家的各种农业贷款和装备。
    修正主义者搞资本主义复辟的经济政策，使得劳动群众，首先是工人阶级的负担越来越沉重。这种负担最明显的反映，就是各种物价不断上涨，特别是食品的价格不断上涨。
    在发展经济方面实行修正主义方针，把经济发展纳入资本主义轨道，结果就产生了发展资本主义经济所固有的各种可悲的特点：失业，生产的无政府状态和竞争。因此，修正主义者就面临许多巨大的困难。甚至在修正主义国家之间的经济关系方面，特别是在经济互助委员会的范围中，也出现了这种困难。
    文章在揭露苏联等修正主义者统治的国家同帝国主义和国际资产阶级加紧进行多方面的经济勾结时说，修正主义的背叛道路不能不使修正主义者统治的国家同国际资产阶级的勾结更加紧密。这条道路必将使这些国家的经济进一步地纳入世界资本主义经济的轨道，从而使自己的经济受世界资本主义的变化和危机的摆布。
    文章指出，在修正主义者统治的国家里，在文化、艺术、道德和生活方式等领域中，也出现了急转直下朝着资产阶级蜕化变质的情况。苏联和其它修正主义者统治的国家的文化生活和生活方式的变化，同西方资本主义国家的这方面的变化，已日益难以区别。
    鼓吹利己主义、个人主义、资产阶级的人道主义与和平主义，诬蔑社会主义范畴的意识形态的资产阶级各种颓废的文艺流派，已经代替了宣传共产主义思想的革命文艺。
    在修正主义者掌权的国家里，在散布资产阶级颓废文化的同时，还日益大开门户，用宗教的鸦片来毒害人们。到处可以看到宗教观念的重新泛滥和教会活动的重新活跃。根据苏联报纸自己发表的统计数字就可以看出，苏联全国各地举行宗教仪式的次数在最近十年中增加了两倍到三倍。
    文章说，单凭这些事实，人们就可以清楚地看出广大群众，特别是青年受到的究竟是什么样的思想教育。这也就难怪在修正主义者统治的国家里，还普遍地发生着骇人听闻的流氓行为和犯罪事件。
    文章说，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者听任道德败坏，大量散布资产阶级思想和宗教信仰，竭力在劳动群众中消除一切革命的影响，竭力从思想上使工人阶级和青年蜕化变质，以便更加为所欲为地推行他们复辟资本主义的背叛阴谋。
    文章接着指出，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者在他们叛卖的道路上，在他们所控制的党内，消除了一切马克思列宁主义的和革命的东西。这些党已经变成了资产阶级的党，变成了属于资产阶级范畴的改良主义的党。修正主义者思想上和政治上的堕落，也反映在这些党在组织上的分崩离析，这些党完全抛弃了列宁主义关于党的生活的准则和原则。
    修正主义者自从在苏联和其他一些国家篡夺了党和国家的领导权以来，采取了一系列措施，从中央到地方，清洗领导机构中的坚强的革命干部，代之以忠于修正主义路线的人。
    党的下级机关变动更大。在党的这些领导机关中，工人和集体农庄庄员的人数大大减少，现在这些机关里塞满了技术人员和专家。事实上，这些机关已经完全落在苏联官僚主义和掌权的技术人员手中，一句话，落在今天统治苏联的特权阶层的手中。
    文章说，修正主义者千方百计取消党的阶级性。这样一个“全民”党更便于实现他们的叛卖目的。
    修正主义者向资产阶级分子、小资产阶级分子、野心家和官僚敞开了党的大门。
    列宁主义的一切原则遭到践踏，应该用以指导党和无产阶级的一切准则遭到破坏，其结果是团结不可避免地遭到了破坏，所以修正主义党是决不可能团结的。不能团结、争论不休和矛盾重重，甚至在各国修正主义领导集团内部，也都更加明显地暴露出来。世界舆论所共知的一系列事实就证明了这种情况。
    文章说，在修正主义领导集团内部存在这种分歧和争吵以及无原则的争权夺利的斗争，不仅是和修正主义意识形态领域的个人主义、自私自利和民族主义的劣根性相联系的，而且也是和修正主义方针在各方面所遭受的声名狼藉的惨败相联系的。这些情况的存在是这些国家的革命人民进行抵抗和斗争的结果，是马克思列宁主义党为揭露修正主义背叛行径而进行的伟大的原则性斗争的结果，这就使得修正主义者不知所措，迫使他们不时地改变自己的策略、方法和演变过程。
    文章指出，修正主义集团为了维持自己的统治，镇压革命人民的反抗和人民群众的不满，象所有的统治者一样，广泛使用了软硬兼施的手段。一方面，这些修正主义集团竭尽造谣惑众之能事，以便欺骗群众，蒙蔽群众，把修正主义的背叛作为创造性的马克思列宁主义，把资本主义复辟作为“民主的”社会主义向群众贩卖，抑制他们的觉悟和磨灭他们的意志，使他们不采取革命行动；另一方面，这些修正主义集团正采取野蛮的高压措施，来镇压任何敢于起来反对它们的人。这些人被逮捕，被拘留，被监禁在集中营里，或者被宣布为“精神病患者”，被送进精神病院受“治疗”。
    文章最后说，尽管修正主义者施展蛊惑人心的伎俩和采取种种镇压措施，但是对修正主义者的抵抗和斗争正在加强，而且必然要继续加强。这种抵抗和斗争将日益采取更加有组织的形式，并且不可避免地会转变成为一场真正的革命，把修正主义叛徒领导集团推翻，把它们赶下台。修正主义者所统治的国家中的工人阶级将觉醒起来，将了解到残酷无情的实际情况，站在全体劳动群众的前列，投入战斗，给修正主义集团以致命打击，来捍卫社会主义和重建无产阶级专政。
