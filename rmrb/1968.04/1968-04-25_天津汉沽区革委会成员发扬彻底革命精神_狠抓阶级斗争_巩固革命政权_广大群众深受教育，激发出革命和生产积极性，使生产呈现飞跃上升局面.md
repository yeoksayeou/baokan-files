Members of the Tianjin Hangang District Revolutionary Committee Carry Forward the Spirit of Thorough Revolution

Grasp Class Struggle and Consolidate Revolutionary Power

The Masses Are Deeply Educated, and Revolutionary and Production Enthusiasm Soar, Leading to a Surge in Production

Our reporter learned that the Tianjin Hangang District Revolutionary Committee, following the great teacher Chairman Mao's instruction to "never forget class struggle," with the enthusiastic assistance of the military's support-left personnel, has carried forward the spirit of thorough proletarian revolution. They have gone deep into the front lines of class struggle, leading the masses to launch a fierce attack on class enemies, further consolidating the new revolutionary power. The entire district is in a state of revolutionary fervor, and production is booming.

After the Hangang District Revolutionary Committee was established in December last year, some comrades thought: now that the revolutionary committee has been established, we should focus on production. Others thought: the capitalist roaders have been overthrown, and power is in the hands of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, so the class enemies can't cause big trouble, we can relax a bit. Under the influence of these thoughts, they temporarily relaxed their grip on class struggle, which had some impact on the revolution and production.

After discovering this problem, the support-left troops immediately discussed it with the members of the district revolutionary committee, held three expanded meetings of the revolutionary committee, and organized a Mao Zedong Thought study class to learn Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle. They thoroughly discussed the current manifestations of class struggle. Through the study, everyone recognized the complexity of class struggle, which mainly manifested in four aspects: class enemies are still trying to use the differences within our ranks and the anarchist trend to disrupt the revolutionary great alliance and the three-in-one combination; they are spreading the evil wind of economism, disrupting Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production"; some class enemies disguise themselves as revolutionaries, playing both sides, infiltrating the revolutionary ranks to cause trouble; some class enemies are spreading the black wind of reversing cases. These facts made the members of the district revolutionary committee realize: although the revolutionary committee has been established, there is still a struggle between seizing power and counter-seizing power, between restoration and counter-restoration. Only by firmly grasping class struggle can we consolidate the new revolutionary power and lead the people to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. Many comrades deeply examined their own complacent thoughts, recognizing that relaxing class struggle is disloyal to Chairman Mao. Everyone unanimously decided to build the revolutionary committee into a strong command center leading the masses in class struggle and immediately mobilize the masses to launch a "people's war" to annihilate the class enemies.

Should this "people's war" to annihilate the enemies be commanded from the office or should leaders go deep into the masses and personally command the battle on the front lines of class struggle? Everyone agreed that leaders should go deep into the masses, directly passing on Mao Zedong Thought and the party's policies to the masses, fully mobilizing and organizing them; to grasp the new issues and trends in class struggle, thereby continuously deepening the movement. After reaching a consensus, the revolutionary committee decided to leave one standing committee member in the office to grasp the overall situation, while the other ten standing committee members went to the front lines of class struggle.

After the leading cadres of the revolutionary committee went deep into the front lines of class struggle, they conducted thorough investigations and research. Based on understanding the masses' active thoughts, according to the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction that "holding study classes is a good method, many problems can be solved in study classes," they organized numerous Mao Zedong Thought study classes with class struggle as the central content. Since the establishment of the revolutionary committee, the entire district has set up more than 18,000 study classes, with over 90,000 people participating in the study. In the study classes, everyone seriously studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle, recalled the bitterness of the old society, discussed the sweetness of the new society, and talked about the reality of class struggle, universally strengthening the awareness of class struggle. The entire district quickly launched a comprehensive "people's war" to annihilate the class enemies.

The Tianjin Daily Chemical Auxiliary Factory had two factions of mass organizations that, under the instigation of class enemies, were constantly fighting each other, making it difficult to carry out the revolutionary great criticism, delaying the unification of the two factions, and affecting production. This time, with the help of the district revolutionary committee members and the military's support-left personnel, the two factions of mass organizations set up study classes. Everyone sat together to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, not only achieving revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, but also jointly exposing the black hands that disrupted the revolutionary great unity. This further educated the masses, ignited the enthusiasm for revolution and production among the workers, and led to a surge in production.

After the leading members of the Hangang District Revolutionary Committee went to the front lines of class struggle, they acted both as commanders and fighters. They went deep into the masses, humbly learned from the masses, and fought side by side with the masses, strengthening their awareness of class struggle and enriching their experience in grasping class struggle. The district revolutionary committee was further consolidated and developed in the class struggle, and it also promoted the establishment of revolutionary committees at the grassroots level. In Tianjin City, Hangang District took the lead, becoming the first district to achieve a sea of red.

    天津汉沽区革委会成员发扬彻底革命精神
    狠抓阶级斗争  巩固革命政权
    广大群众深受教育，激发出革命和生产积极性，使生产呈现飞跃上升局面
    本报讯　天津汉沽区革命委员会成员遵照伟大导师毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，在解放军支左人员的热情帮助下，发扬无产阶级彻底革命精神，深入阶级斗争第一线，率领广大群众向阶级敌人发起猛攻，进一步巩固了新生的革命政权。全区革命轰轰烈烈，生产热气腾腾。
    汉沽区革命委员会于去年十二月份成立以后，一些同志认为：革委会成立了，要好好抓抓生产。也有人认为：走资派打倒了，政权掌握在无产阶级革命派手里，阶级敌人翻不了大浪，可以松口气了。在这些思想的支配下，他们一度放松了抓阶级斗争，使革命和生产受到了一些影响。
    发现这一问题后，支左部队立即同区革命委员会的成员研究，召开了三次革命委员会扩大会议，并且举办了毛泽东思想学习班，学习毛主席有关阶级和阶级斗争的教导，大摆当前阶级斗争的表现。通过学习，大家认识到阶级斗争的复杂性，主要表现在四个方面：阶级敌人还在千方百计利用我们队伍中的分歧和无政府主义思潮，破坏革命的大联合和三结合；大刮经济主义的妖风，破坏毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针；有的阶级敌人伪装革命，大耍反革命两面派手段，混入革命队伍内部进行捣乱；有的阶级敌人大刮翻案黑风。这样一些事实使区革命委员会的成员认识到：革命委员会成立了，但是依然存在着夺权反夺权、复辟反复辟的斗争，只有狠抓阶级斗争，才能巩固新生的革命政权，才能带领人民群众把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。许多同志都深刻检查了自己的麻痹思想，认识到放松阶级斗争，就是对毛主席的不忠。大家一致决定，一定要把革命委员会建设成率领广大群众开展阶级斗争的坚强指挥部，立即发动群众开展一场围歼阶级敌人的“人民战争”。
    开展这场围歼敌人的“人民战争”，是蹲在机关里指挥战斗，还是深入群众，亲自到阶级斗争的第一线指挥战斗？大家一致认为，领导应该深入到群众中去，把毛泽东思想和党的方针政策直接交给群众，把群众充分发动起来，组织起来；掌握阶级斗争的新问题、新动向，从而把运动不断引向深入。认识统一以后，革委会决定留一名常委在机关掌握面上情况，其它十名常委都到阶级斗争第一线去。
    革委会领导干部深入到阶级斗争第一线以后，经过认真调查研究，在掌握群众活思想的基础上，根据伟大领袖毛主席“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的教导，大办以阶级斗争为中心内容的毛泽东思想学习班。从革委会成立至今，全区办起了一万八千多个学习班，有九万多人参加了学习。在学习班上，大家认真学习毛主席关于阶级斗争的教导，忆旧社会的苦，谈新社会的甜，摆阶级斗争的现实，普遍增强了阶级斗争的观念。全区很快掀起了一场全面围歼阶级敌人的“人民战争”。
    天津日用化学助剂厂过去两派群众组织在阶级敌人的煽动下，“内战”不息，使革命大批判不能顺利开展，两派迟迟不能联合，生产也受到了影响。这次在区革命委员会成员和解放军支左人员的帮助下，两派群众组织办起了学习班，大家坐在一起共同学习毛主席的最新指示，不但在毛泽东思想的基础上实现了革命大联合和革命的“三结合”，而且共同揪出了破坏革命大联合的黑手。这就进一步教育了广大群众，激发了职工革命和生产的积极性，使生产呈现了飞跃上升的局面。
    汉沽区革委会领导成员到阶级斗争第一线以后，既当指挥员，又当战斗员。他们深入群众，虚心向群众学习，和群众一起并肩战斗，既增强了阶级斗争观念，又丰富了抓阶级斗争的经验。区革命委员会在阶级斗争中得到进一步巩固和发展，同时推动了基层单位革命委员会的建立。在天津市内，汉沽区一马当先，第一个实现了全区一片红。
