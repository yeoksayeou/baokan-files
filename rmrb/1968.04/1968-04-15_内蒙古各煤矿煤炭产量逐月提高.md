The revolutionary workers in various coal mines in Inner Mongolia have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and earnestly implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They have focused on revolution and vigorously promoted production. Since last September, the coal output in the region has increased month by month. In the first quarter of this year, the local key coal mines in the region completed the state plan ahead of schedule by three days and exceeded the target. The daily production level of the centrally-affiliated coal mines in March increased by 8.5 percent compared to February. Since April, the daily coal output in the region has also seen a significant increase compared to March.

Many coal mine workers have resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production." They regard focusing on revolution and vigorously promoting production as an important sign of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Before achieving great unity, the two factions at the Sihongtou Coal Mine in Ningcheng County, Chifeng Prefecture, insisted on making revolution above ground and focusing on production below ground, without engaging in debates underground. An old worker from the mine said: "Above all, we must listen to Chairman Mao's words. Although we may have different views on certain issues, there can be no disagreement in implementing Chairman Mao's great instructions and promoting revolution and production." During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, this mine consecutively exceeded the state plan for two years. In the first quarter of this year, despite a 18-day halt in production due to the relocation of the mining area, it still exceeded the production plan by 3 percent.

    内蒙古各煤矿煤炭产量逐月提高
    内蒙古各煤矿的革命职工紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，认真落实毛主席的最新指示，狠抓革命，猛促生产。全区煤炭产量从去年九月份以来逐月提高。今年第一季度，全区地方重点煤矿提前三天超额完成国家计划。中央直属煤矿三月份日产水平比二月份提高了百分之八点五。四月份以来，全区煤炭日产量又比三月份有大幅度增长。
    许多煤矿的革命职工，坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，把狠抓革命、猛促生产作为忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的一个重要标志。昭乌达盟宁城县四龙头沟煤矿的两派群众在大联合以前，始终坚持井上闹革命，井下抓生产，不在井下搞辩论。这个矿的老工人说：千条万条，听毛主席的话是第一条。尽管我们对某些问题看法有分歧，但是贯彻执行毛主席的伟大指示，抓革命，促生产，不能有分歧。这个矿在无产阶级文化大革命中，连续两年超额完成国家计划；今年第一季度，虽然因为迁移采区停产十八天，但仍超额百分之三完成了生产计划。
