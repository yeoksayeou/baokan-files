The Albanian "Unity" newspaper recently published an editorial stating that the "non-proliferation" treaty draft and "nuclear protection" agreement concocted by the U.S. and the Soviet Union are developments of the infamous Moscow Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Their purpose is to consolidate the U.S.-Soviet nuclear monopoly, engage in nuclear blackmail, oppose China, and suppress and extinguish national liberation movements.

The article states: The "non-proliferation" treaty draft recently manufactured by the U.S., the Soviet Union, and the British Empire in reality demands that other countries abandon the production and possession of nuclear weapons, and abandon the right to maintain national independence and sovereignty. This treaty divides the world's countries into two categories: nuclear states and non-nuclear states; protectors and the protected; rulers and the ruled; masters and slaves. It paves the way for U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism to establish world hegemony; it creates conditions for intensifying the opposition to the People's Republic of China.

The article points out: The anti-China conspiracies of imperialists and revisionists will absolutely not erase the principled policies of the People's Republic of China. The Chinese people have consistently advocated for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons, and have repeatedly reiterated that China will never be the first to use nuclear weapons. Socialist China's possession of nuclear weapons has thoroughly shattered the nuclear monopoly of imperialism and revisionism. China is an insurmountable obstacle to the imperialist and revisionist plans of aggression.

The article says: People of various countries have risen up in revolution under the banner of Marxism-Leninism. They will sweep imperialism and revisionism, along with their plans to rule the world, off the face of the earth.

New Delhi, April 9th: According to reports from Singapore, the Malaysian newspaper "Front Line" published an article on March 31st strongly condemning the Soviet revisionist renegade clique's collusion with the U.S.-British imperialist tool, the "Malaysia" Rahman puppet regime, to sabotage the Malaysian people's national liberation struggle.

The article points out that the first "ambassador" sent by the Soviet revisionists to "Malaysia" arrived in Kuala Lumpur on March 24th. This is another despicable act of treachery by the Soviet revisionist renegade clique against the Malaysian people, further exposing the reactionary face of the Kosygin clique, fully demonstrating that the Soviet revisionists are accomplices of U.S. imperialism and enemies of the Malaysian people.

The article states that for many years, the Soviet revisionists have actively assisted U.S.-British imperialism and its tool, the Rahman-Lee Kuan Yew puppet regime, in imposing the neo-colonial product "Malaysia" on the people of Malaysia and North Kalimantan, and in inserting "representatives" of the Rahman-Lee Kuan Yew puppet regime into the Asian-African people's organizations they control. Since 1965, the collusion between the Soviet revisionists and the Rahman-Lee Kuan Yew puppet regime has become more frequent. Lee Kuan Yew's visits to Moscow, the establishment of a TASS office in Kuala Lumpur, and the activities of Soviet "cultural delegations" and "trade delegations" in Malaysia are all components of the U.S.-Soviet collusion to sabotage the Malaysian people's national liberation struggle.

The article points out that the criminal acts of the Soviet revisionist renegade clique are doomed to failure. They can only further expose their own reactionary nature.

The article concludes by emphasizing that in Malaysia, an increasing number of people are grasping Mao Zedong Thought. They are determined to overcome all difficulties, achieve final victory in the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and in the struggle for a truly independent, democratic, and unified Malaysia.

    阿《团结报》指出美苏加紧核勾结妄图扑灭民族解放运动
    世界革命人民将把帝修从地球上扫除掉
    马来亚报纸谴责苏修勾结傀儡集团破坏马人民解放斗争
    新华社地拉那电　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》不久前发表编辑部文章指出，美苏炮制的“防止核扩散”条约草案和“核保护”协议，是臭名远扬的莫斯科部分禁止核试验条约阴谋的发展，其目的在于巩固美苏的核垄断，进行核讹诈；反对中国；压制和扑灭民族解放运动。
    文章说：美苏伙同英帝最近制造的“防止核扩散”条约草案，实际上就是要其它国家放弃生产和掌握核武器，放弃维护民族独立和民族主权的权利。这个条约把世界各国分为两种等级：核国家和无核国家；“保护”别国的和被“保护”的；统治的和被统治的；主人和奴隶。它为美帝和苏修建立世界霸权开辟道路；为加紧反对中华人民共和国制造条件。
    文章指出：帝国主义者和修正主义者的反华阴谋绝对抹煞不了中华人民共和国的原则性政策。中国人民一贯主张全面禁止和彻底销毁核武器，并且一再重申中国永远不会首先使用核武器。社会主义的中国拥有核武器彻底粉碎了帝国主义和修正主义的核垄断。中国是帝国主义和修正主义推行侵略计划不可逾越的障碍。
    文章说：各国人民在马克思列宁主义的旗帜下已经起来革命。他们将把帝国主义和修正主义连同其统治世界的计划一齐从地球上扫除掉。
    新华社九日讯　新加坡消息：在新加坡出版的马来亚报纸《阵线报》三月三十一日发表文章，强烈谴责苏修叛徒集团勾结美英帝国主义的工具“马来西亚”拉赫曼傀儡集团，破坏马来亚人民的民族解放斗争。
    文章指出，苏修派驻“马来西亚”首任“大使”已经在三月二十四日抵达吉隆坡，这是苏修叛徒集团无耻背叛马来亚人民的又一卑鄙勾当，它进一步暴露了柯西金之流的反动嘴脸，充分说明了苏修是以美帝为首的帝国主义的帮凶，是马来亚人民的敌人。
    文章说，多年来，苏修就积极帮助美英帝国主义及其工具拉赫曼—李光耀傀儡集团，把新殖民主义的产物“马来西亚”强加在马来亚和北加里曼丹人民头上，把拉赫曼—李光耀傀儡集团的“代表”塞入他们操纵的亚非人民群众组织，一九六五年以来，苏修和拉赫曼—李光耀傀儡集团的勾结更加频繁，李光耀到莫斯科奔走，塔斯社在吉隆坡设立办事处，苏修的
  “文化代表团”和“贸易代表团”到马来亚进行活动等等，都是美苏勾结破坏马来亚人民的民族解放斗争
  的组成部分。
      文章指出，苏修叛徒集团的罪恶勾当是注定要失
  败的，它只能进一步暴露它们自己的反动面目。
      文章最后强调指出，在马来亚，越来越多的人民开始掌握了毛泽东思想，他们决心克服一切困难，
  在反对美帝及其仆从的斗争中，在争取实现一个真正独立、民主、统一的马来亚的斗争中，赢得最后的胜
  利。
