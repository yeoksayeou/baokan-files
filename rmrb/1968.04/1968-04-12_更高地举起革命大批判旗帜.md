Revolutionary criticism is the grand direction of the struggle in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; it is a serious struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads; it is a struggle to seize power from the revisionists and capitalists in the realm of ideology; it is the most fundamental content running through the entire Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; it is the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres' all-out attack and counterattack against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party; it is the driving force behind all our tasks. Only by continuously and persistently carrying out revolutionary criticism can we constantly raise our awareness of class struggle and line struggle, overcome all obstacles on our path forward, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "One of our important tasks on the ideological front at present is to carry out criticism of revisionism." We must not only seize power from the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, such as the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, organizationally, but also overthrow and expose them politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and eliminate their poisonous influence.

The handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, though already overthrown, have not changed their counterrevolutionary nature, and their counterrevolutionary ghosts have not dispersed. "At any opportunity, they will stir up trouble, trying to overthrow the Communist Party and restore the old society." We must continuously expose, criticize, and struggle against them to thoroughly eliminate the poisonous influence of their counterrevolutionary revisionist line, root out the traitors, spies, and diehard capitalist roaders they have planted in various departments, and make all their schemes to restore capitalism completely fail, ensuring that our Party and country will never change color.

In the current complex class struggle, it is especially necessary to closely combine the situation and tasks of the struggle, carry out revolutionary criticism more deeply and extensively, and through criticism, strengthen our class struggle consciousness, raise our awareness of line struggle, sharpen our eyes, and train our sense of smell to expose the destructive activities of class enemies wearing false masks and unmask those who pretend to support the revolution but actually oppose it, and drive them out from all fronts, "to defend our great victories already won and to be won."

All levels of revolutionary committees must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, mobilize the masses, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's great theories, lines, principles, methods, and policies on carrying out the revolution under proletarian dictatorship, raise the banner of revolutionary criticism higher, and concentrate our forces to expose and thoroughly criticize the crimes of the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, such as the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, so that the invincible great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought can be planted on all fronts!

    更高地举起革命大批判旗帜
    革命的大批判，是无产阶级文化大革命斗争的大方向；是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的严重斗争；是从思想上夺修正主义的权，夺资本主义的权；是贯穿整个无产阶级文化大革命最基本的内容；是无产阶级革命派和革命群众对党内最大的一小撮走资派的全面进攻、全面反击；是推动各项斗争任务的动力。只有不间断地持久地开展革命的大批判，才能不断地提高路线斗争觉悟和阶级斗争观念，才能扫除前进道路上的重重障碍，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    毛主席教导说：“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判。”我们不仅要从组织上夺中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大一小撮走资派及其代理人的权，而且要从政治上、思想上、理论上把他们批倒批臭，肃清其流毒。
    党内最大的一小撮走资派，虽然已被打翻在地，但是他们的反革命本性不变，反革命幽灵不散。“一遇机会，他们就会兴风作浪，想要推翻共产党，恢复旧中国。”必须不停顿地对他们进行大揭露、大批判、大斗争，才能彻底肃清他们的反革命修正主义路线的流毒，挖出他们安插在各个部门中的叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派，使他们一切复辟资本主义的妄想彻底破产，保证我们的党和国家永远不变颜色。
    在当前阶级斗争错综复杂的情况下，特别需要紧密地结合形势和斗争任务，更深入、更广泛地开展革命的大批判，通过大批判把阶级斗争观念搞得浓浓的，把路线斗争觉悟提得高高的，眼睛擦得亮亮的，嗅觉练得灵灵的，揭露那些戴着假面具的阶级敌人的破坏活动，识破那些伪装拥护革命而实际反对革命的反革命两面派，并把他们从各条战线上清洗出去，“保卫我们已经取得的和将要取得的伟大的胜利”。
    各级革命委员会，都要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，放手发动群众，活学活用毛主席关于无产阶级专政下进行革命的伟大理论、路线、方针、方法和政策，更高地举起革命大批判的旗帜，更集中力量把中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大一小撮走资派及其代理人的罪行，揭深批透，让战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍一切阵地！　（《江西日报》三月二十九日社论）
