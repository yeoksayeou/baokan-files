The great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in essence, is a great political revolution under the conditions of socialism, a revolution by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, a continuation of the long struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the broad revolutionary masses led by it and the reactionary Kuomintang, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Chairman Mao's latest directive most profoundly elucidates the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and most penetratingly reveals its class content. To better implement Chairman Mao's latest directive, members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Beijing Motorcycle Manufacturing Plant, revolutionary workers, and PLA cadre members stationed at the plant held a symposium to study and understand Chairman Mao's latest directive. Below is the record of this symposium.

The comrades who participated in the symposium unanimously agreed that at this crucial moment of seizing a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the publication of Chairman Mao's latest directive is once again providing us with the most powerful ideological weapon for carrying out class struggle. We must seriously study, enthusiastically propagate, resolutely implement, and bravely defend Chairman Mao's latest directive, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Over the past two years, the practice of class struggle in our factory's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has completely proven the correctness of the great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant judgment. This magnificent struggle is, in essence, a great political revolution under the conditions of socialism, where the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat, under the invincible guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, are fighting against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes.

In this great political revolution, we have exposed a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party in the factory, and we have thoroughly defeated the hidden traitors, spies, and monsters and demons. In February of this year, with the help of the PLA cadre members stationed at the factory, our factory's Revolutionary Committee was born in victory.

Two Classes, Two Lines, Two Roads in Sharp Struggle

Our factory was formed in 1958 during the Great Leap Forward by the merger of five handicraft cooperatives. The predecessors of these cooperatives were small workshops and small ironworks, and other private industrial and commercial enterprises. The members came from all directions, and their backgrounds were quite complex. Some bad elements took advantage of the merger to infiltrate the workforce. For example, the former deputy director of the Electrical Workshop was a Kuomintang spy. Before liberation, this fellow, to escape punishment from the people, fled from Xi'an to Beijing and opened a radio repair shop. During the high tide of cooperation, he took the opportunity to infiltrate the worker ranks. After entering the factory, he flattered the capitalist roaders and used activities like repairing radios for the families of the capitalist roaders to quickly gain their favor. He first usurped the position of production group leader and then became the deputy director of the original Electrical Workshop.

The revolutionary workers participating in the symposium, with great indignation, exposed and denounced the crimes of the capitalist roaders in the factory who sheltered and indulged the bourgeoisie and other exploiting class elements to usurp key positions in the factory. They said: Before 1964, our factory had many work teams and key departments where the leadership was in the hands of capitalists, small business owners, and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. The revolutionary workers in the factory had all fought against these bad elements taking power. For example, an illegal capitalist infiltrated our factory, and the capitalist roaders arranged for him to be the production group leader and even planned to make him the director of a sub-factory. The workers were very angry and organized themselves to investigate his criminal history. However, the capitalist roaders still defended him and suppressed the issue for more than a year without taking any action.

In our factory, revolutionary workers resisting the monsters and demons taking power was not a one-time or two-time occurrence but a constant struggle. Whenever the capitalist roaders did such evil deeds, we resisted and fought back. However, because the capitalist roaders controlled the Party, government, financial, and cultural powers in our factory, they had the final say, and we could only keep our words to ourselves. Here is an important issue for us to think about: Our factory has hundreds of revolutionary comrades. Why did the capitalist roaders not choose these people but instead chose this group of monsters and demons? Through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our awareness of class struggle and line struggle has been raised, and we now realize that this is not strange at all. It is a manifestation of the struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads. As the saying goes, "Flowers match flowers, willows match willows, broken baskets match rotten brooms." The capitalist roaders and monsters and demons have a common stench and breathe from the same nostril, mainly because they stand on the same reactionary position. They also have a set of counter-revolutionary theories, which are the "theory of the extinction of class struggle," "theory of the fusion of public and private," and "theory of the value of factory profits" of the Chinese Khrushchev. These revisionist counter-revolutionary theories are the basis for them to sit on the same bench, collude with each other, and use each other. The capitalist roaders in our factory once openly declared that their personnel policy was "appointing based on talent," and "those who can pull gold and silver are 'good people.'" Based on this reactionary theory, their organizational line is to collude with untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, spies, and traitors and push them to responsible positions, usurp the power of the factory. After obtaining power, they use their authority to commit evil deeds and pull the socialist enterprise towards the capitalist track.

Carry Out Revolutionary Criticism Deeply and Persistently

After reviewing the intense class struggle in the factory, the comrades unanimously agreed that to expose the enemy and eliminate their poison, we must carry out revolutionary criticism well. They said: Persisting in carrying out revolutionary criticism is what the enemy fears the most and is also a great classroom for the broad revolutionary masses to raise their awareness of line struggle. Chairman Mao's latest directive is the most powerful weapon for us to carry out revolutionary criticism. We must more effectively master this weapon and carry this political revolution through to the end!

Our factory had an untransformed rightist who, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, used research as a cover to seize financial and personnel power over a small unit, keeping the lid on class struggle in that unit for a long time. The deputy director of the Revolutionary Committee went deep into this unit and, together with the revolutionary masses, exposed this rightist who insisted on a reactionary stance. Why did some of our cadres hand over power to an untransformed rightist? It was because the counter-revolutionary revisionist poison of the Chinese Khrushchev had not been thoroughly eliminated. Therefore, to thoroughly defeat the class enemy, we must deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, politically, ideologically, and thoroughly criticize and expose the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods of the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. We mobilized the masses extensively, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, and fiercely criticized the Chinese Khrushchev's "theory of the extinction of class struggle," criticized the fallacies of "good at work is good at politics," and "whether it's a white cat or a black cat, as long as it catches mice, it's a good cat."

This, combined with exposing and criticizing the crimes of a handful of class enemies within the factory, clearly shows that this handful of class enemies are precisely the black whiskers on the black line of the Chinese Khrushchev, precisely the social base for the Chinese Khrushchev's attempt to restore capitalism, just one above and one below. Now that their old tricks are all exposed, the reactionary faces of this group are completely exposed in broad daylight.

Continuously and Proactively Launch Attacks on the Class Enemy

The comrades participating in the symposium believed that under the dictatorship of the proletariat, class struggle is to seize back the power usurped by a handful of class enemies, consolidate the revolutionary regime, and thoroughly defeat bourgeois ideology with proletarian ideology, establishing Mao Zedong Thought in our minds. Therefore, uncovering the lid of class struggle is, on the one hand, exposing the enemy, and on the other hand, continuously fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, uncovering the lid of class struggle in our own minds. Only by establishing a firm belief in being eternally loyal to Chairman Mao, eternally loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and eternally loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in our minds, can we stand firmly, see clearly, distinguish between enemies and ourselves, and leave the enemy no place to hide.

The comrades at the meeting repeatedly reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings on "never forgetting class struggle." They said: The factory Revolutionary Committee has been established, and the revolutionary situation is getting better and better. Just in this good situation, a few comrades only heard praise and thought the situation was stable, advocating to set up stalls and proceed with production and work in an orderly manner.

As soon as this problem surfaced, the PLA cadre members stationed in the factory immediately sounded the alarm: The class enemy has not been sleeping, and they are still dreaming of using various means to seize the opportunity to reverse the verdict or using soft and hard methods to attack us. We must continuously raise our awareness of class struggle and line struggle and proactively launch attacks on the class enemy.

Chairman Mao taught us: "Even after the complete annihilation of all exploiting classes on Earth for many years, it is very likely that there will still be representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek regime active in various places. The most die-hard among these people will never admit their defeat." The closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to complete victory, the more the class enemy will struggle desperately. We must use Chairman Mao's latest directive as a weapon, take class struggle as the key link, and thoroughly smash the rightist reversal wind, rightist conservatism, rightist splitism, and rightist capitulationism. We must launch continuous and uninterrupted attacks on the class enemy and not give the enemy any breathing room. We will not stop until we achieve complete victory.

    坚决执行毛主席最新指示狠抓阶级斗争
    深入开展革命大批判粉碎敌人垂死挣扎
    ——北京市摩托车制造厂学习毛主席最新指示的座谈会纪要
    伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”毛主席的最新指示，最深刻地阐明了无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义，最精辟地揭示了无产阶级文化大革命的阶级内容。为了更好地贯彻执行毛主席的这一最新指示，北京市摩托车制造厂革命委员会成员、革命职工和驻厂解放军支左人员举行座谈会，认真学习和领会毛主席的最新指示。下面是这次座谈会的纪要。
    参加座谈会的同志们一致认为：在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，毛主席最新指示的发表，是再一次给予我们进行阶级斗争的最强大的思想武器。我们一定要认真地学习、热情地宣传、坚决地执行和勇敢地捍卫毛主席的最新指示，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    两年来，我们工厂无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践，完全证实了伟大领袖毛主席的英明论断。这一场轰轰烈烈的斗争，实质上就是在社会主义条件下，广大无产阶级革命派在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命。
    在这场伟大的政治大革命中，我们揪出了厂里的党内一小撮走资派，把隐藏的叛徒、特务、牛鬼蛇神打得落花流水。今年二月，在驻厂支左解放军同志的帮助下，我们厂的革命委员会胜利诞生。
  两个阶级两条道路两条路线的尖锐斗争
    我们工厂是在一九五八年大跃进中由五个手工业合作社合并而成的。这些合作社的前身，是一些小作坊、小铁工场之类的私营工商业，成员来自四面八方，成份比较复杂。有的坏人利用机构合并的机会混进了职工队伍，有的是打进来的。如原电工车间有个车间副主任，就是一个国民党特务。解放前，这个家伙为了逃避人民惩罚，从西安溜到了北京，开了个无线电修理铺子。在合作化高潮中，他趁机混进了工人队伍。钻进厂后，他就在工厂走资派面前阿谀奉承，并利用为走资派家庭修收音机等活动，很快得到了走资派的赏识，先窃踞了生产小组长的职位，继而当上了原电工车间副主任。
    参加座谈会的革命职工，以无比愤怒的心情，揭发和控诉了厂内走资派包庇纵容资产阶级和其他剥削阶级分子窃踞工厂要职的罪恶。他们说：在一九六四年以前，我们工厂有不少班组和一些要害部门的领导权，是掌握在资本家、小业主和没有改造好的地富反坏右手里的。对这些坏人掌权，工厂的革命职工都同他们作过斗争。如一个不法资本家混进我厂以后，走资派就安排他当了生产组长，甚至准备让他当分厂厂长。工人们很气愤，就自动组织起来，调查了他的罪恶历史。但是，走资派仍然为他辩护，并压了一年多不作处理。
    在我们厂里，革命职工抵制牛鬼蛇神掌权，不是一起两起，而是经常的，只要走资派干这种罪恶勾当，我们就抵制，就斗争。但是，由于走资派掌握了我们厂的党、政、财、文大权，人家说了算，咱们有话只好在肚子里记着。这里有个重要的问题要我们好好想一想，我们厂有几百革命同志，走资派为什么看不中这些人，偏偏看上了这一帮牛鬼蛇神呢？经过无产阶级文化大革命，我们的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟提高了，才认识到原来这并不奇怪，这就是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的表现。俗话说：“花对花，柳对柳，破畚箕对的是烂扫帚。”走资派和牛鬼蛇神臭味相投，一鼻孔出气，主要是由于他们站在共同的反动立场。他们还有一套反革命的理论，就是中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论、“公私融化”论、“工厂利润价值”论。这些修正主义的反革命理论，就是他们能够坐在一条板凳上，互相勾结，互相利用的基础。我们工厂走资派曾公开扬言，他们的干部政策就是“任人唯才”，“能拉金溺银的就是‘好人’”。根据这个反动理论，他们的组织路线就是勾结没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右、特务、叛徒，把他们推上负责岗位，窃踞工厂的大权。有了权以后，就利用职权，胡作非为，把社会主义企业拉向资本主义轨道。
    把革命的大批判深入持久地开展下去
    同志们在回顾了工厂中的激烈的阶级斗争以后，一致认为，要揭露敌人，要肃清他们的流毒，就必须搞好革命的大批判。他们说：坚持开展革命的大批判，是敌人最害怕的，也是广大革命群众提高路线斗争觉悟的大课堂。毛主席的最新指示，是我们进行革命大批判的最有力的武器，我们一定要更有效地掌握这一武器，把这场政治大革命进行到底！
    我们工厂有一个没有改造好的右派分子，在无产阶级文化大革命中以搞科研为名，夺了一个小单位的财权、人事权，使这个单位的阶级斗争盖子长期揭不开。革委会副主任就深入这个单位，和革命群众一起把这个坚持反动立场的右派分子揪了出来。为什么我们的一些干部把权拱手交给了一个没有改造好的右派分子呢？就是因为中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义流毒没有彻底肃清。因此，要彻底打倒阶级敌人，就必须深入地开展革命的大批判，从政治上、思想上批倒批臭、批深批透党内最大的一小撮走资派的反革命修正主义黑货。我们广泛发动群众，用毛泽东思想为武器，狠狠地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，批判了“业务好就是政治好”，“不管白猫、黑猫，能逮耗子就是好猫”等等谬论。
    这和揭发批判厂内一小撮阶级敌人的罪行紧紧结合起来，就可清楚地看出，这一小撮阶级敌人，正是中国赫鲁晓夫这条黑线上的黑须，正是中国赫鲁晓夫妄图复辟资本主义的社会基础，不过是一个在上边，一个在下边罢了。现在把他们的老底统统揭出来，这就把这一伙的反动面目完全暴露在光天化日之下了。
    不断地主动地向阶级敌人打进攻战
    参加座谈会的同志们认为：无产阶级专政下的阶级斗争，就是要夺回被一小撮阶级敌人篡夺的权力，巩固革命的政权，同时要用无产阶级思想去彻底打倒资产阶级思想，在我们头脑里大立毛泽东思想。因此，揭阶级斗争的盖子，一方面是揭露敌人，另一方面要不断地斗私批修，揭我们自己头脑里阶级斗争的盖子。只有在思想上树立起永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的坚定信念，才能立场坚定，心明眼亮，敌我分明，使敌人无藏身之地。
    到会的同志们一遍又一遍地重温毛主席关于“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导。他们说：厂革命委员会成立了，革命的形势越来越好。就在这大好形势下，有少数同志只听到一片赞扬声，觉得局势定了，主张摆开摊子，按部就班地忙生产，搞工作。
    这个问题一露头，厂里支左的解放军同志立即敲起了警钟：阶级敌人并没有睡大觉，他们还在梦想用种种手段，伺机翻案，或是用软硬兼施的办法向我们进攻。我们一定要不断提高阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟，主动地向阶级敌人打进攻战。
    毛主席教导我们：“在地球上全部剥削阶级彻底灭亡之后多少年内，很可能还会有蒋介石王朝的代表人物在各地活动着。这些人中的最死硬分子是永远不会承认他们的失败的。”无产阶级文化大革命越接近全面胜利，阶级敌人越要进行垂死挣扎。我们一定要以毛主席的最新指示为武器，以阶级斗争为纲，彻底粉碎右倾翻案风、右倾保守主义、右倾分裂主义、右倾投降主义。我们要向阶级敌人发起主动的、持续不断的进攻，决不让敌人有喘息的机会。不获全胜，决不收兵。
