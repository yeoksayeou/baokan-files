Representatives of the China-Japan Friendship Association and the Headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) Sign the Minutes of the Talks
Strengthening the China-Japan Friendship Movement and Opposing the Common Enemies of the Two Countries' Peoples

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China Inspires the Liberation Struggles of the Oppressed Peoples of the World, Deals a Heavy Blow to the Imperialists, Revisionists, and Reactionaries, and Is in the Common Interest of the Peoples of the World

Xinhua News Agency, April 10th: Representatives of the China-Japan Friendship Association and the Headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) signed the minutes of their talks in Beijing today. The full text of the minutes is as follows:

At the invitation of the China-Japan Friendship Association, representatives of the Headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine), including Chairman Miyazaki Seiken and Organization Committee Chairman Shimada Masao, arrived in Beijing on March 11th to discuss the plans for friendly exchanges between the peoples of China and Japan in 1968. They held cordial talks with the China-Japan Friendship Association and relevant organizations and conducted friendly visits, extensively interacting with workers, peasants, and Red Guards.

During their stay in Beijing, the representatives of the Headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) were warmly received by Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Chen Yi.

Both sides pointed out in their talks that the current international situation is excellent. The national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are thriving. The great spring victory of the people of South Vietnam has pushed the anti-American struggle to a new stage. The anti-American patriotic struggle of the Japanese people is surging. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is achieving comprehensive victories. The capitalist world led by the United States is in chaos, facing severe political and economic crises, with fiscal crises, soaring prices, currency devaluation, and factory closures. Recently, the head of American imperialism, Johnson, once again threw out the so-called "partial cessation" of bombing North Vietnam as a trick to deceive and confuse, fully exposing the predicament of American imperialism, which is besieged both internally and externally and has nowhere to turn. The days of imperialism led by the United States, modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist clique, and the reactionaries of various countries are getting worse. The development of the situation fully confirms the wise judgment of Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people: "The enemy is rotting day by day, and we are getting better day by day."

The Japanese side is pleased to see that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has thoroughly smashed the evil plot of the Chinese Khrushchev and his gang to restore capitalism, achieving one victory after another. Revolutionary committees at all levels are being established one after another, consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. The Chinese people are universally launching a high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and Mao Zedong Thought is increasingly penetrating the hearts of the people. The cities and countryside across the country present a prosperous scene of seizing the revolution and promoting production. At present, hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, are striving for the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Japanese side stated that the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China not only has great significance for the Chinese people but also deals a heavy blow to imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, inspiring the liberation struggles of the oppressed peoples and nations of the world. It is a great encouragement and support for the Japanese people as well.

The Chinese side warmly praised the Japanese people for raising the banner of independence, democracy, peace, and neutrality, and fighting against American imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, the Japanese reactionaries, and the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist clique led by Miyamoto. Especially in the major struggles against Sato's visit to Taiwan, against Sato's visit to Vietnam, against Sato's visit to the United States, against Chiang Kai-shek's visit to Japan, against the entry of American nuclear aircraft carriers into Sasebo, against the construction of Narita Airport by the Sato government to serve American imperialism's war of aggression, and against the expansion of the American military field hospital, the Japanese people have achieved great victories. Every victory of the Japanese people is a great support and encouragement to the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world. In this great struggle, the Headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) has been at the forefront, bravely fighting. At the same time, it has carried out rich and varied friendly activities, expanding the ranks of the Japan-China friendship movement, and has made great contributions to maintaining and developing the Japan-China friendship movement and the national and democratic movement of the Japanese people. The 700 million Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have always followed the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao: "Except for the pro-American monopolistic capitalists and militaristic warlords, the broad masses of the Japanese people are our true friends." We firmly stand together with the broad masses of the Japanese people who insist on Japan-China friendship, fight together, and win together. The Chinese side is deeply convinced that the Japan-China friendship movement, under the leadership of the Headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine), will continue to be consolidated, strengthened, and developed.

Both sides reaffirmed that American imperialism is the common enemy of the peoples of China and Japan, as well as the common enemy of the peoples of Asia and the world. The Johnson-Sato talks in November last year plotted the evil scheme of "maintaining" the U.S.-Japan "security treaty," indicating that the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries are determined to be enemies of the peoples of China and Japan and the peoples of various countries in Asia. Therefore, smashing the U.S.-Japan "security treaty" is a fighting task for the peoples of China and Japan and is an urgent task for the development of the China-Japan friendship movement. The Sato government is resolutely following the policy of aggression and war of American imperialism, frantically reviving Japanese militarism, and attempting to bind the Japanese people to the American war chariot. The facts have proven that the Sato government is a big accomplice of American imperialism in Asia. The Soviet modern revisionism and the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist clique led by Miyamoto are actively serving American imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries, degenerating into loyal lackeys of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. Both sides agreed that the Japanese people's opposition to the four enemies led by American imperialism is in the interests of the Japanese people and is also in the interests of the Chinese people, the peoples of Asia, and the peoples of the world. To the greatest extent possible, isolate and strike American imperialism, the main enemy, it is necessary to unite all possible anti-American forces and establish the broadest united front against American imperialism that does not include the enemy. The China-Japan friendship movement is an indispensable part of this anti-American united front. The great teacher of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, said: "The peoples of China and Japan should unite, the peoples of Asian countries should unite, all oppressed peoples and oppressed nations in the world should unite, all peace-loving countries should unite, all countries and individuals subjected to aggression, control, interference, and bullying by American imperialism should unite, to form a broad united front against American imperialism, to foil the plans of aggression and war of American imperialism, and to defend world peace." Both sides expressed their determination to continue to struggle in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings.

Both sides, in accordance with the spirit of mutual respect, equality, mutual benefit, and mutual support pointed out in the joint statement issued by the friendship associations of the two countries in October 1966, reached a consensus on the plans for friendly exchanges in 1968.

    中日友协和日中友协（正统）总部代表签署会谈纪要
    加强中日友好运动  反对两国人民的共同敌人
    中国文化大革命鼓舞世界被压迫人民的解放斗争，沉重打击帝修反日本人民反对以美帝为首的四个敌人，符合世界人民的共同利益
    新华社十日讯　中国日本友好协会的代表和日本中国友好协会（正统）总部的代表，今天在北京签署了会谈纪要。会谈纪要全文如下：
    应中国日本友好协会的邀请，日本中国友好协会（正统）总部代表、理事长宫崎世民，组织委员长岛田政雄，为商谈一九六八年度中日两国人民间的友好往来计划，于三月十一日到达北京，同中国日本友好协会以及有关团体举行了亲切的会谈，并进行了友好访问，同工农兵和红卫兵进行了广泛的接触。
    日本中国友好协会（正统）总部代表在北京期间，受到了周恩来总理、陈毅副总理的亲切接见。
    双方在会谈中一致指出，当前国际形势一片大好。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民的民族解放运动正在蓬勃发展。越南南方人民的新春大捷，把反美斗争推上了更新的阶段。日本人民的反美爱国斗争日益高涨。中国无产阶级文化大革命正在取得全面胜利。以美国为首的资本主义世界一片混乱，财政危机，物价高涨，货币贬值，工厂倒闭，面临着严重的政治、经济危机。最近美帝国主义头子约翰逊再次抛出所谓部分“停炸”越南北方的诱和阴谋，正充分暴露了美帝国主义内外交困，走投无路的窘境。以美帝为首的帝国主义，以苏修领导集团为中心的现代修正主义和各国反动派的日子越来越不好过了。形势的发展完全证实了中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的英明论断：“敌人一天天烂下去，我们一天天好起来”。
    日本方面高兴地看到，毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，彻底粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫及其一伙复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋，取得了一个又一个的伟大胜利，各级革命委员会一个接着一个地建立，巩固了无产阶级专政。中国人民普遍掀起活学活用毛主席著作的高潮，毛泽东思想日益深入人心。全国城乡呈现出一片抓革命、促生产的欣欣向荣的景象。目前，亿万革命群众，在毛主席最新指示的指引下，正为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利而奋斗。日本方面表示，中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，不仅对中国人民具有伟大的意义，同时沉重地打击了帝、修、反，鼓舞着全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族的解放斗争，对日本人民也是一个巨大的鼓舞和支持。
        中国方面热烈赞扬日本人民高举独立、民主、和平、中立的旗帜，反对美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义、日本反动派和日共宫本修正主义集团的斗争，特别是在反对佐藤访台、反对佐藤访越、反对佐藤访美、反对蒋匪经国访日、反对美帝核航空母舰侵入佐世保、反对佐藤政府为美帝侵略战争效劳修建成田飞机场、反对美军扩建野战医院等重大斗争中所取得的伟大胜利。日本人民所取得的每一个胜利，对中国人民和世界革命人民都是一个巨大的支持和鼓舞。在这个伟大的斗争中，日本中国友好协会（正统）总部站在前列，英勇地进行了斗争。同时又开展了丰富多采的友好活动，扩大了日中友好队伍，为维护和发展日中友好运动和日本人民的民族、民主运动，作出了巨大的贡献。用毛泽东思想武装起来的、经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼的七亿中国人民，一贯遵循伟大领袖毛主席的“日本除了亲美的垄断资本和军国主义军阀之外，广大人民都是我们的真正朋友”的教导，坚定地同坚持日中友好的广大日本人民团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。中国方面深信，日中友好运动在日本中国友好协会
  （正统）总部的领导下，将会不断地巩固、壮大和发展。
    双方一致重申，美帝国主义是中日两国人民的共同敌人，也是亚洲人民和世界人民的共同敌人。去年十一月约翰逊、佐藤会谈，策划了“保持”美日
  “安全条约”的罪恶阴谋，表明美日反动派决心与中日两国人民和亚洲各国人民为敌。因此，粉碎美日“安全条约”是中日两国人民的战斗任务，也是当前发展中日友好运动的迫切任务。佐藤政府死心塌地追随美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，疯狂复活日本军国主义，妄图把日本人民绑在美国的战车上，事实证明佐藤政府是美帝国主义在亚洲的大帮凶。苏联现代修正主义和日共宫本修正主义集团积极为美帝国主义和日本反动派效劳，堕落为美日反动派的忠实走卒。双方一致认为，日本人民反对以美帝国主义为首的四个敌人，是符合日本人民的利益，也是符合中国人民、亚洲人民和世界人民的利益的。为了最大限度地孤立和打击美帝国主义这个最主要的敌人，必须团结一切可以团结的反美力量，建立一个不包括敌人在内的反对美帝国主义的最广泛的统一战线。中日友好运动是这个反美统一战线的不可分割的组成部分。中国人民伟大导师毛主席说：“中日两国人民要联合起来，亚洲各国人民要联合起来，全世界一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族要联合起来，一切爱好和平国家要联合起来，一切受美帝国主义侵略、控制、干涉和欺负的国家和人士要联合起来，结成反对美帝国主义的广泛的统一战线，挫败美国帝国主义的侵略计划和战争计划，保卫世界和平。”双方一致表示，将继续遵循毛主席这一教导而奋斗。
    双方本着两国的友好协会在一九六六年十月发表的共同声明指出的相互尊重、平等互利和相互支援的精神，就一九六八年度友好往来计划，取得了一致协议。
