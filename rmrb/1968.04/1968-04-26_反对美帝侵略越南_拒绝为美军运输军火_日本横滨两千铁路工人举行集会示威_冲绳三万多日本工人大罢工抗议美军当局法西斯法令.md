Two thousand railway workers in Yokohama hold rally and demonstration

Over 30,000 Japanese workers in Okinawa go on strike to protest U.S. military authorities' fascist orders

According to Xinhua News Agency, the Oriental News Agency reported: About 2,000 national railway workers in Yokohama held a rally on the evening of the 22nd in Tsurumi Ward's Shioda Park, opposing U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam and firmly refusing to transport weapons for U.S. troops.

The resolution passed at the rally emphasized the need for a sustained struggle to overthrow the reactionary Sato government and abolish the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." The resolution stated: "We oppose U.S. imperialism's war of aggression in Vietnam and demand the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Vietnam. We will resolutely continue our struggle to refuse the transportation of all weapons for U.S. troops, including fuel for U.S. jet planes."

After the rally, the participants, filled with enthusiasm, held a demonstration march in the streets of Yokohama, shouting slogans such as "Yankees, get out of Vietnam and Asia!" "We refuse to transport fuel for U.S. jet planes!" "Down with the Sato government!"

According to Xinhua News Agency, the Oriental News Agency reported: Over 38,000 Japanese workers employed at U.S. military bases in Okinawa began a large-scale strike on the 24th, demanding the right to strike and increased wages.

This strike by Japanese workers in Okinawa is in response to the U.S. military authorities' "Order No. 116," which enslaves workers and deprives them of the right to strike.

The U.S. military authorities, frightened by the large-scale strike of Japanese workers in Okinawa, adopted a two-pronged counter-revolutionary strategy of carrot and stick. On one hand, they dispatched a large number of military police to intimidate the workers, and on the other hand, they expressed willingness to recognize the Japanese workers' right to negotiate. The Japanese workers in Okinawa saw through the U.S. military authorities' plot and insisted on continuing the strike.

On the morning of the 24th, the determined workers set up picket lines at the entrances of 69 U.S. military bases, including the U.S. military command in Okinawa, the Kadena Air Base, and the Naha naval port. The flustered U.S. military authorities dispatched many military police and helicopters to deal with the striking workers. Eighty U.S. soldiers at the Kadena Air Base, which houses B-52 bombers, even threatened the Japanese workers with carbines to suppress their struggle. But the workers were undeterred and continued their sit-in strike. Workers gathered around the U.S. military command severely condemned the barbaric actions of U.S. imperialism and bravely fought against the U.S. military.

Meanwhile, bus drivers, dock workers, postal workers, and sugar workers in Okinawa also went on strike.

    反对美帝侵略越南　拒绝为美军运输军火
    日本横滨两千铁路工人举行集会示威
    冲绳三万多日本工人大罢工抗议美军当局法西斯法令
    据新华社讯　据东方通讯社报道：横滨市二千名左右国营铁路工人二十二日晚上在鹤见区汐田公园举行大会，反对美帝国主义侵略越南，坚决拒绝为美军运输军火。
    大会通过的一项决议强调指出，要以持续不断的斗争来推翻反动的佐藤政府和废除日美“安全条约”。决议说：“我们反对美帝国主义的侵越战争，要求美军完全撤出越南。我们坚决坚持斗争，反对给美军运输一切军火，包括供美国喷气式飞机使用的燃料。”
    会后，与会者情绪高昂，在横滨市街头举行示威游行，高呼“美国佬从越南和亚洲滚出去！”“我们拒绝运输美军喷气式飞机燃料！”“打倒佐藤政府！”等口号。
    新华社二十五日讯据东方通讯社报道：在冲绳美国军事基地劳动的三万八千名日本工人，从二十四日起举行大规模罢工，要求享有罢工权利和增加工资。
    冲绳日本工人这次大罢工，是为了抗议美军当局制订残酷奴役工人、剥夺工人罢工权利的“第一百一十六号法令”而举行的。
    被冲绳日本工人大罢工吓破了胆的美国军事当局，阴险地采取了软硬兼施的反革命两手政策。他们一方面出动大批军警，对工人进行威吓，一方面又表示承认日本工人有进行谈判的权利。冲绳日本工人看穿了美军当局的阴谋，坚持举行罢工。
    二十四日清晨，顽强战斗的工人们在冲绳的美军司令部、嘉手纳空军基地和那霸军港等六十九个美国军事基地的入口处布置了纠察队。慌了手脚的美军当局，出动了许多军警和直升飞机来对付罢工工人。驻有B—52型轰炸机的嘉手纳空军基地的八十名美军，竟用卡宾枪威胁日本工人，镇压日本工人的斗争。但工人们不怕威胁，坚持举行静坐罢工。聚集在美军司令部周围的工人们，严厉谴责美帝国主义的野蛮行径，英勇地同美军进行了斗争。
    与此同时，冲绳的公共汽车工人、码头工人、邮电工人和制糖工人，也举行了罢工。
