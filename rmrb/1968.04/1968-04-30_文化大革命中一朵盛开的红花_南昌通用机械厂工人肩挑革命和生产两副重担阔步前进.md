The revolutionary workers of Nanchang General Machinery Plant are closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, applying the boundless enthusiasm and infinite wisdom unleashed during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to production. In implementing Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production," they have achieved new victories.

Machines run day and night,
Production rises month by month

In the fierce struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, most of the workers in this plant have stayed at their production posts, carrying out revolutionary activities in their spare time. The factory's machine tools have been running non-stop, and production has been increasing month by month. In the first year of the Cultural Revolution, they completed the annual state production plan ahead of schedule. In January of last year, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the factory united to seize power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. Since then, all the revolutionary workers in the factory have united to fight the enemy and focus on production, completing the annual state production plan one month ahead of schedule and significantly reducing fuel consumption. In the first quarter of this year, they completed the quarterly production plan four days ahead of schedule. The young Nanchang General Machinery Plant has been praised as a red flower blooming in the Cultural Revolution in Jiangxi.

Last year, for a period, the agent of Khrushchev in China launched a fierce counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression" against the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, disrupting the revolution and production. In the forge and riveting workshop of the General Machinery Plant, some deceived masses left their production posts, and many processes were on the verge of stopping. The revolutionary workers in this workshop divided into two teams: one participated in protecting the factory, and the other stayed at their production posts. Following Chairman Mao's teaching to "resolutely carry out the decision, fear no sacrifice, and overcome all difficulties to strive for victory," they took turns day and night, taking over all the short-line processes left by the deceived masses. When there was no one to operate the air hammer, the forger Tan Yinyi took on both responsibilities. In August, the workshop's task of producing fifty shovels was not only completed on time but also ahead of schedule, thoroughly smashing the enemy's evil plot to disrupt the revolution and production.

Fighting for Chairman Mao,
Adding Splendor to the Cultural Revolution

The revolutionary workers of Nanchang General Machinery Plant, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, deeply understand that every brilliant achievement made in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is the greatest encouragement to the revolutionary people of the whole country and the world, and a heavy blow to the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries. Their greatest motivation for grasping the revolution and promoting production comes from this broad vision and high sense of responsibility. In November last year, the higher authorities assigned the factory an urgent task: to quickly cast forty paper-cutting machines to print the treasured book of the revolutionary people. However, the casting task for rock-loading machines was also very urgent. Rock-loading machines are not only urgently needed for the construction of our country's mines and border areas but also support the construction of our Vietnamese and Albanian brothers. This is a glorious internationalist duty. With both tasks at hand, how should they be handled? The workers said: "Producing paper-cutting machines is to spread Mao Zedong Thought throughout the world, and it should be completed as the primary task! Completing the rock-loading machine casting task on time is to better fulfill our internationalist duty, and it cannot be delayed for a single day! Chairman Mao supports us, and we must fight for Chairman Mao's glory and add splendor to the Cultural Revolution! We will take on both tasks! We guarantee the quality of the products!" The entire factory immediately launched a tense and arduous battle. As soon as the wooden patterns were made, sand casting began. Here, molding was done on one side, and casting was already in full swing on the other. Each process was closely coordinated. The workers ignored the bell signaling the end of the shift, and some worked for more than ten hours. Master Zhang Zengchun had stomach problems, and comrades always advised him to rest on time. He said: "I can't rest easy! The quality of the paper-cutting machines for the treasured book cannot be compromised! I will spare no effort to ensure the quality!" Young pattern maker Zhou Fugen was injured in his foot while protecting the Red Guards in the struggle against the capitalist roadline. To speed up the casting progress, in addition to completing his own tasks quickly, he always actively supported the casting section where there were fewer people, carrying buckets of high-temperature molten iron weighing hundreds of pounds back and forth. Many veteran workers, in response to the large size, thin walls, and high technical requirements of the paper-cutting machines, worked with young workers to carry forward the spirit of daring to think and act, overcoming technical difficulties one by one through repeated experiments. After more than ten days of arduous struggle, the casting task for the paper-cutting machines for the treasured book was completed ahead of schedule and with guaranteed quality. The production task for the rock-loading machines was also completed ahead of schedule and with guaranteed quality and quantity.

The workers of Nanchang General Machinery Plant, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are creating more and more new achievements in the battle to grasp the revolution and promote production.

    文化大革命中一朵盛开的红花
    南昌通用机械厂工人肩挑革命和生产两副重担阔步前进
    南昌通用机械厂的革命职工，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，把无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲和无穷的智慧，用到了生产上。在贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召中，立下了新功。
      机器天天转，
    生产月月升
    在无产阶级文化大革命的激烈斗争中，这个厂的大部分职工都坚守生产岗位，坚持业余时间闹革命，全厂车床天天运转不停，生产月月向上。文化大革命第一年，他们提前完成了全年的国家生产计划。去年一月间，厂里无产阶级革命派联合起来，夺了党内一小撮走资派的权。从此，全厂革命职工团结对敌，同心搞生产，提前一个月超额完成了全年国家生产计划，燃料消耗大幅度下降。今年第一季度，又提前四天完成季度生产计划。年青的南昌通用机械厂，被誉为江西文化大革命中盛开的一朵红花。
    去年有个时期，中国赫鲁晓夫在江西的代理人，对无产阶级革命派疯狂地进行反革命
  “围剿”，破坏革命和生产。通用机械厂的锻铆车间，部分受蒙蔽的群众脱离了生产岗位，眼看许多工序即将停产。这个车间的革命工人，分成两班人马：一批参加护厂，一批坚守生产岗位。他们遵照毛主席
  “下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，日夜轮流奋战，把受蒙蔽群众离开后的短线工序，全部顶了下来。空气锤没有人开，锻工谭尹礼便两副重担一肩挑。八月份，这个车间五十台铲斗生产任务，不仅没受影响，而且提前完成了月计划，彻底粉碎了阶级敌人妄图破坏革命和生产的罪恶阴谋。
    为毛主席争气，
    为文化大革命添彩
    无限忠于毛主席的通用机械厂的革命工人，深深懂得，在毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命中取得每一项光辉成就，对全国、全世界革命人民都是一个最大的鼓舞，对帝、修、反都是个沉重的打击。他们抓革命促生产的最大干劲，就是来自这种广阔的胸怀和高度的责任感。去年十一月，上级给这个厂下达了一项紧急任务：为了赶印革命人民心中的宝书，需要火速铸造四十台切纸机。但是，当时装岩机的铸造任务也很紧张。装岩机，不仅是祖国矿山和边疆建设所急需，还要支援越南和阿尔巴尼亚兄弟国家的建设，这是光荣的无产阶级国际主义义务。两项任务齐下，怎么办？工人们说：“赶制切纸机，是为了把毛泽东思想传遍天下，要当作首要任务完成！提前完成装岩机铸造任务，是更好地履行国际主义义务，一天也不能推迟！毛主席为我们撑腰，我们要为毛主席争光，给文化大革命添彩！两项任务我们包了！产品质量我们保了！”全厂立即投入了一场紧张而艰苦的战斗。木模刚打出来，翻砂就开始了。这里一边造型，那里浇铸已经干得热气腾腾。各个工种工序之间，紧密配合。工人们不理睬下班的钟声，有的人一干就是十几个小时。老师傅张增春有胃病，同志们总是劝他按时下班休息。他却说：“我不放心啊！宝书切纸机的质量，一点也不能马虎！我拚命也要把紧技术质量关！”青年造型工人周福根，在同资产阶级反动路线的斗争中，因保护红卫兵摔伤过脚。为了加速铸造进度，他除了加快完成自己的工作任务外，总是主动支援人手较少的浇铸工段，抬起一二百斤重一桶的高温铁水，来回奔忙。许多老工人针对切纸机体积大、壁薄、技术要求高的特点，同青年工人一起，发扬敢想敢干的革命精神，经过一次又一次试验，终于克服了一道道技术难关。经过十多天的艰苦奋战，宝书切纸机的铸造任务，全部提前按质完成了。装岩机的生产任务，也提前按质按量完成了月计划。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的通用机械厂工人，在抓革命促生产的战斗中，正在创造着越来越多的新成就。
