More than 150 revolutionary workers from Hengyang Locomotive Depot of the Guangzhou Railway Bureau formed a strike force. They resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's directive to seize the revolution and promote production. They vigorously struck down the various evil winds stirred up by class enemies. From the day of their formation, they have been fighting day and night on the railway transportation lines, achieving outstanding results.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, April 21 — In the battle to achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a vanguard collective that seizes the revolution and promotes production under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought has emerged on the railways of Hunan Province—the Hengyang Locomotive Depot Strike Force for Seizing the Revolution and Promoting Production. This strike force, composed of over 150 revolutionary workers from the Hengyang Locomotive Depot of the Guangzhou Railway Bureau, has resolutely carried out the great directive of the great leader Chairman Mao to "seize the revolution and promote production." Since early February this year, they have united the broad masses of the people, effectively combating the anarchist reactionary trend and counter-revolutionary economicist evil winds stirred up by a handful of class enemies, contributing to the further consolidation of the new order of revolution and production at the Hengyang railway hub.

Hengyang Station is an important railway hub. During the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary staff at this station have been studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, continuously raising their class consciousness, and the revolutionary and production situation on the station has been getting better and better. However, for a period of time, due to the mischief caused by the anarchist reactionary trend and counter-revolutionary economicist evil winds stirred up by a handful of class enemies, production sometimes still suffered some impact. Facing this situation, the broad revolutionary staff decided to take practical actions to counter the anarchist and counter-revolutionary economicist evil winds.

Liu Youzhi, a locomotive driver from the Hengyang Locomotive Depot, with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and deep concern for the interests of the state, rallied locomotive drivers Tang Shengyi, Tang Zhizhen, and Li Hongfa. They said: The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, is to ensure that our proletarian dictatorship state will never change color. We workers listen to Chairman Mao's words the most and understand the interests of the broad revolutionary people the best. We must resolutely do a good job in railway transportation. They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great teachings: "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." The more they studied, the firmer their resolve, the more they studied, the hotter their hearts. They solemnly swore under Chairman Mao's portrait: To achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, they would spare no effort to ensure the smooth operation of railway transportation.

As soon as this railway workers' strike force was born, it immediately received the resolute support of the PLA comrades stationed at the locomotive depot. Many revolutionary workers and old workers also rushed to join. In a short period, this strike force grew from four people to over 150. They fear neither hardship nor fatigue, rushing to wherever they are needed.

In January and February, the Hengyang Locomotive Depot had not yet achieved revolutionary unity. During the development of the Strike Force for Seizing the Revolution and Promoting Production, some comrades brought their differing opinions into the strike force. Liu Youzhi and others studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions with everyone: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason to necessarily split into two irreconcilable factions." They said: "We workers listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. We resolutely put revolutionary interests first." They unanimously decided: To resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great strategic line of "seizing the revolution and promoting production," all revolutionary masses who carry out Chairman Mao's great line, regardless of which faction they are from, are welcome to join the strike force. In this way, the Strike Force for Seizing the Revolution and Promoting Production not only became a production shock brigade but also a vanguard for promoting revolutionary unity. Under the promotion of the strike force, the Hengyang Locomotive Depot achieved revolutionary unity by class and workshop in late February.

This battle-ready collective, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, has been fighting day and night on the railway transportation lines since the day of its formation, achieving many outstanding results. Driver Jin Xingsheng and his fellow crew members once drove a fast train from Hengyang to Zhuzhou and then pulled an express train from Zhuzhou back to Hengyang. At this point, it was time for them to rest. They prepared the locomotive with water, tidied up the fire bed, and completed the preparations before handing over. However, the oncoming driver suddenly fell ill and did not come. The signal to depart had already been given. What to do? They decided that no matter how tired and hard it was, they had to ensure that this train departed on time. The three of them stood on the locomotive, facing Chairman Mao's portrait, loudly reciting Chairman Mao's teachings: "What is work? Work is struggle. Where there are difficulties and problems, we need to go and solve them. We go to work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go, this is a good comrade." They overcame fatigue and drove the express train to Chenzhou, then drove a passenger train back to Hengyang Station, working continuously for 24 hours before going off duty.

In this battle-ready collective, there are many old drivers, driver chiefs, and team leaders. They broke away from old customs and habits, voluntarily taking on the duties of assistant drivers and firemen when needed. When old driver Deng Dafu took on the job of a fireman, someone said: "You've been a driver for 20 years, and you're old. Don't take on the job of a fireman." Deng Dafu replied: "We serve the people. We resolutely do what is beneficial to the state and the people, and we resolutely do not do what is detrimental to the state and the people."

The Strike Force for Seizing the Revolution and Promoting Production, following the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings, "Only by liberating all mankind can the proletariat finally liberate itself," conducted patient and meticulous ideological and political work on some revolutionary masses influenced by anarchist thoughts, helping them stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and jointly seize the revolution and promote production. At the beginning, some people were deceived by class enemies and did not actively support the activities of the strike force, but the comrades of the strike force, regardless of the difficulties, remained unwavering in their resolve to carry out Chairman Mao's great line of "seizing the revolution and promoting production." On one hand, they resolutely exposed the sabotage plots of class enemies, and on the other hand, they patiently persuaded and educated the revolutionary masses. Two young firemen, influenced by the anarchist reactionary trend and counter-revolutionary economicist evil winds, did not strictly follow labor discipline. The comrades of the strike force started from class education, recalling bitterness and sweetness with them, arousing their proletarian consciousness and line struggle consciousness, helping them find the root of their thoughts poisoned by anarchist thoughts. These two young firemen finally realized that they had been deceived by class enemies and joined the strike force, studying Chairman Mao's works seriously with everyone, actively caring about production, and working well.

The exemplary actions of the Hengyang Locomotive Depot Strike Force for Seizing the Revolution and Promoting Production have been praised by the broad revolutionary staff of the Hengyang Railway Bureau. People praised them as Chairman Mao's good workers and extensively carried out activities to learn from the strike force.

    衡阳机务段一百五十多名革命工人组成一个突击组
    坚决执行毛主席抓革命促生产方针
    狠狠打击阶级敌人煽起的各种妖风
    他们从成立那天起，日日夜夜战斗在铁路运输线上，创造了优异成绩
    据新华社长沙二十一日电　在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的战斗中，湖南省铁路线上出现了一个用毛泽东思想武装起来的抓革命促生产的先进集体——衡阳机务段抓革命促生产乘务战斗组。这支由广州铁路局衡阳机务段的一百五十多名革命工人组成的突击组，坚决执行伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，从今年二月初以来，团结广大群众，有力地打击了阶级敌人煽起的无政府主义反动思潮和反革命经济主义歪风，为衡阳铁路枢纽站进一步巩固革命和生产的新秩序作出了贡献。
    衡阳站是一个重要的铁路枢纽站。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，这个站的广大革命职工活学活用毛主席著作，阶级觉悟不断提高，站上革命、生产形势越来越好。但是，前一段时间由于一小撮阶级敌人煽起的无政府主义反动思潮和反革命经济主义妖风作怪，生产有时还要受到一些影响。面对着这种情况，广大革命职工决心以实际行动，来反击无政府主义和反革命经济主义妖风。
    衡阳机务段火车司机刘友志，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱，对国家利益高度关心的心情，串连了火车司机唐生义、唐智珍和李洪发。他们说：毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，就是要保证我们无产阶级专政的国家永不变色。我们工人阶级最听毛主席的话，最懂得广大革命人民的利益，一定要坚决把铁路运输搞好。他们反复学习了毛主席的伟大教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”他们越学志越坚，越学心越热，当场成立了抓革命促生产乘务战斗组。同时研究了保证客货列车正常运行和增加货运量的措施。四位工人在毛主席像下庄严宣誓：为了夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，为了保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，要竭尽一切力量，保证铁路运输畅通无阻。
    这个铁路工人战斗组一诞生，立刻受到驻机务段的解放军同志的坚决支持，不少革命职工和老工人也纷纷要求参加。在短短的时间里，这个战斗组便从四个人发展到了一百五十多人。他们不怕苦，不怕累，那里需要就赶到那里。
    一、二月间，衡阳机务段还没有实现革命大联合。在抓革命促生产乘务战斗组发展过程中，有些同志把分歧的意见带进了战斗组。刘友志等便和大家一起学习毛主席的最新指示：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”他们说：“我们工人阶级最听毛主席的话，我们坚决以革命利益为重。”他们一致决定：坚决贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大战略方针，凡是执行毛主席的伟大方针的革命群众，不管是那一派，都欢迎他们参加战斗组。这样，抓革命促生产乘务战斗组，不仅成为生产上的突击队，而且成为促进革命大联合的先锋。在战斗组的促进下，衡阳机务段在二月下旬实现了按班组、按车间的革命大联合。
    这支用毛泽东思想武装起来的战斗组，自从成立的那天起，就日日夜夜战斗在铁路运输线上，创造了许多优异成绩。司机金行声和同班的副司机、司炉，有一次将一列快车从衡阳开到株洲，又从株洲把一列特快列车拉到衡阳。这时，应该是他们下班休息的时候了。他们把机车上好水，整理好火层，作好了交班前的准备工作。但是，接班的司机因为突然生病没有来。这时列车停站的时间到了，开车的信号也发过了。怎么办？他们决定自己再苦再累，也要把这趟列车正点开出。他们三个站在机车上，面向毛主席像，高声背诵毛主席的教导：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”他们战胜疲劳，把这次特快列车开到郴州，又将一列客车从郴州开回衡阳车站，连续工作了二十四个小时才下班。
    在这个战斗集体中，有许多老司机、司机长、车队长。他们打破了陈规陋习，在工作需要时主动顶替副司机、司炉的职务。老司机邓达全顶替司炉工作的时候，有的人说：“你是二十年的老司机了，年纪又大，不要顶司炉了吧。”邓达全回答说：“我们是为人民服务的。对国家、对人民有利的事就坚决干，对国家、对人民不利的事就坚决不干。”
    抓革命促生产战斗组遵循伟大领袖毛主席“实行马克思所说只有解放全人类才能最后解放无产阶级自己”的教导，对一部分受到无政府主义思想影响的革命群众，进行了耐心细致的思想政治工作，帮助他们站到毛主席革命路线上来，共同抓革命促生产。开始时，有些人上了阶级敌人的当，不积极支持战斗组的活动，但战斗组的同志不管有多大困难，贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针的决心毫不动摇。一方面坚决揭露阶级敌人的破坏阴谋，一方面耐心地说服、教育革命群众。有两名青年司炉，由于受到无政府主义反动思潮和反革命经济主义歪风的影响，对劳动纪律遵守不够。战斗组的同志便从阶级教育入手，同他们一起忆苦思甜，激发他们的无产阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟，帮助他们找到了受无政府主义思想毒害的思想根源。这两名青年司炉终于认识到自己上了阶级敌人的当，并且参加了战斗组，和大家一起认真学习毛主席著作，主动关心生产，工作做得很好。
    衡阳机务段抓革命促生产战斗组的模范行动，获得了衡阳铁路分局广大革命职工的赞扬，人们称赞他们是毛主席的好工人，并且广泛开展了向战斗组学习的活动。
