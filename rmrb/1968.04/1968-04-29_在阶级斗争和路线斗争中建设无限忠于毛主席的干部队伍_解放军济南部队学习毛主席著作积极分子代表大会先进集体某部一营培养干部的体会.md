In the struggles of class and line, build a corps of cadres unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao — the experience of the First Battalion of a certain unit in the active study of Chairman Mao’s works by the active study group representatives of the Jinan Military Region of the People's Liberation Army.

Chairman Mao teaches us: “The successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause are grown in the midst of the people's struggles, tempered in the great winds and storms of the revolution.” The advanced collective in the active study of Mao Zedong Thought in the Jinan Military Region of the People's Liberation Army — the Party Committee of the First Battalion of a certain unit, in accordance with Chairman Mao’s teachings, has always attached great importance to, in the struggles of two classes, two roads, and two lines, cultivating and building a corps of cadres unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao, unlimitedly loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line. In the waves of class struggle, the class struggle consciousness of all cadres in the battalion has been continuously enhanced, and their awareness of line struggle has been continuously raised. The revolutionary construction of the troops has been increasingly improved, and various tasks have been successfully completed. In the struggle to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have once again won a collective second-class merit for the people.

The Party Committee of this battalion has the following experiences in cultivating and building a corps of cadres unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao:

Use Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line to educate cadres, continuously raising their consciousness of class and line struggle.

Chairman Mao teaches us: “In the historical stage of socialism, there still exist classes, class contradictions, and class struggle, there exist the struggles between the socialist and capitalist roads, and there exists the danger of capitalist restoration. … From now on, we must talk about this every year, every month, and every day, so that we have a relatively clear understanding of this issue, and a Marxist-Leninist line.” The Party Committee of the First Battalion studied Chairman Mao’s teachings and, from the practice of class struggle, realized that the main target of the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat is the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. Therefore, under the dictatorship of the proletariat, class struggle is prominently and concentratedly manifested as the struggle between the two lines within the Party. Without the consciousness of line struggle, the consciousness of class struggle is abstract and incomplete, and it is easy to be confused about friends and enemies and to be deceived by the capitalist roaders within the Party who wave the red flag to oppose the red flag. Therefore, the Party Committee of the battalion gives the first lesson to newly promoted cadres on class struggle and line struggle, letting cadres firmly remember Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line. They say: The leadership should care for and love cadres. Among all cares, the greatest care is to strengthen the education of cadres on class and line struggle; among all loves, the greatest love is to fundamentally raise the consciousness of cadres on class and line struggle.

Battalion Commander Yang Xuecheng, who escaped from famine and begged for food since childhood, was liberated from the sea of suffering by Chairman Mao. With an unlimited love for Chairman Mao, he joined the army. After enlisting, he fought bravely in battles, was wounded, and won military merits. In peacetime, he worked actively and selflessly. However, during the black wind of large-scale military exercises stirred up by the counter-revolutionary revisionist Luo Ruiqing, he was confused for a moment and focused on military training without paying much attention to political and ideological construction. The Party Committee of the battalion specially convened a Party Committee meeting for this matter. At the meeting, the committee members used Chairman Mao’s brilliant work “On Rectifying the Party’s Erroneous Ideas” and the 1960 decision of the enlarged meeting of the Central Military Commission “On Strengthening Political and Ideological Work in the Army” as weapons to criticize Yang Xuecheng’s purely military viewpoint. Everyone talked about how, during the War of Liberation, the First Battalion was assigned the task of blocking the enemy. Due to the bitter struggle movement before the battle, the class consciousness of the cadres and soldiers was raised, and they understood the strategic significance of this battle. With the support and cooperation of brother units, all the cadres and soldiers of the battalion fought for three days and nights, withstood the enemy’s repeated attacks by fourteen regiments, annihilated more than 1,400 enemy troops, and successfully completed the blocking task, winning a great merit and being praised as the “Iron First Battalion.” Everyone said: In the past, victories were achieved through politics, through people’s consciousness, through bravery and fearlessness of death. Now, in building the army, we still need these. The comrades’ enthusiastic help made Yang Xuecheng raise his consciousness of class and line struggle and realize that he had deviated by focusing on training. He said: “A leading cadre without the consciousness of line struggle has no ability to distinguish, is the most confused person, will make the biggest mistakes, and will be disloyal to Chairman Mao.” Afterwards, Yang Xuecheng actively worked with the political instructor to promote the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works, implemented Lin Biao’s instructions on emphasizing politics, and organized the troops to thoroughly criticize the revisionist fallacies spread by the counter-revolutionary revisionist Luo Ruiqing.

Later, the Party Committee of the battalion sent Yang Xuecheng to participate in the socialist education movement in the locality, letting him raise his consciousness of class and line struggle in the great waves of mass struggle. The struggles of two classes, two roads, and two lines in the countryside made him see more clearly the sharpness and complexity of class struggle in the socialist stage. From the facts of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres fighting against the black wind, resisting the current, and insisting on the socialist road, he learned their firm stance of being unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line; from the facts of some cadres who “only focus on grain, cotton, and oil, and do not focus on friends and enemies,” and thus fall politically, he drew lessons. Yang Xuecheng deeply realized: A leading cadre can only raise his consciousness of class and line struggle high, high, high, to avoid deviation in thick fog, and not sway in fierce winds and waves; if there is no consciousness of class and line struggle, there is no soul, and one will go astray and harm the revolution.

In March last year, the First Battalion was assigned the task of “supporting the left” and “supporting agriculture” in eight districts, seventy-seven communes, and five hundred sixty-eight production brigades in a certain county. At that time, the struggles of two classes, two roads, and two lines in this region were very intense. Yang Xuecheng and everyone firmly executed and defended Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line, and received the praise of the broad masses.

In accordance with Chairman Mao’s teaching that “Communist Party members should experience wind and rain and see the world,” let cadres go to the fiery mass struggle to temper themselves.

Chairman Mao teaches us: “We Communist Party members should experience wind and rain and see the world; this wind and rain is the great wind and rain of the people’s struggle, and this world is the great world of the people’s struggle.” The Party Committee of the First Battalion, in accordance with Chairman Mao’s teachings, boldly and unreservedly let cadres go to the great waves of mass class struggle to temper themselves. They regarded the fiery mass class struggle as a great classroom for cultivating cadres, a great examination hall for testing cadres, and a great furnace for tempering cadres. There, the teachers are the most numerous, the teaching materials are the most lively, and the examination questions are the hardest. Let cadres go to the fiery mass class struggle to experience wind and rain and see the world, or let cadres detach themselves from class struggle and “study in seclusion” is the struggle of two lines on the issue of cultivating cadres. Therefore, they resolutely sent the cadres out, guiding the cadres to consciously break private interests and establish public interests in class struggle, and temper themselves to be unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao in class struggle.

Deputy Political Instructor Bao Longkui, who was an elementary school teacher before enlisting in 1962, was sent by the Party Committee of the battalion, along with other cadres, to a nearby middle school to carry out the task of supporting the left, letting him temper himself in the fiery struggle.

When Bao Longkui first arrived at the school, he was afraid of saying the wrong thing and being criticized by the revolutionary youngsters, and he did not work boldly. After the battalion’s leadership discovered this, they immediately studied Chairman Mao’s teachings on cultivating successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause with him, inspiring him to learn from the revolutionary youngsters, get rid of the word “fear,” and replace it with the word “dare,” bravely tempering and transforming himself. Bao Longkui, after studying Chairman Mao’s teachings, made up his mind, consciously tempered himself, and actively exposed his private interests to the revolutionary teachers and students, listening to everyone’s criticisms. Afterwards, he actively propagated Chairman Mao’s latest instructions and, together with the revolutionary teachers and students, continuously pushed the Cultural Revolution of the school forward.

Last year, when the entire battalion participated in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in a certain county, the Party Committee of the battalion again sent Bao Longkui alone to the supply and marketing system, where the situation was complex and the struggle was intense, to carry out the task of supporting the left. At that time, two of the three revolutionary mass organizations here had been disbanded in the capitalist restoration current, and the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses had been suppressed. He studied the “Sixteen Points” repeatedly and believed that disbanding these two organizations was not in line with Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line and should be rectified. However, when he was about to rectify these two organizations, he hesitated again, fearing that he might make trouble. At this time, he thought of Chairman Mao’s teaching that “our responsibility is to be responsible to the people,” believing that rectifying these two organizations was “being responsible to the people,” was standing on the side of Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line, and was loyal to Chairman Mao; not rectifying these two organizations was being irresponsible to the people, was standing on the side of the bourgeois reactionary line, and was disloyal to Chairman Mao. Therefore, he immediately reported to the battalion and obtained the support of the leadership, resolutely rectified these two organizations, and received the support of the broad revolutionary masses. Subsequently, Bao Longkui also helped these three organizations achieve great unity on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought. At this time, a handful of class enemies who were unwilling to fail exploited some shortcomings of Bao Longkui in the process of promoting great unity, incited a few masses, attacked Bao Longkui, and sabotaged the great unity. Facing this situation, Bao Longkui had the emotion of fearing difficulties. After the Party Committee Secretary and Political Instructor Lu Guizhi learned of this situation, he studied Chairman Mao’s teaching “Never forget class struggle” with him, helped him analyze the essence of the problem, and encouraged him to lead the masses to advance bravely. Bao Longkui overcame the emotion of fearing difficulties, actively checked his shortcomings to the masses, and actively propagated Chairman Mao’s latest instructions, doing in-depth and detailed ideological and political work for the masses, consolidating the great unity, and isolating and striking a handful of class enemies.

The great waves of mass struggle have powerfully promoted Bao Longkui’s ideological revolutionization. When the Party Committee of the battalion helped him summarize his experience, he deeply felt: The fiery mass struggle can most touch one’s soul. In the fiery mass struggle, one should consciously and bravely wash away the dirt and mud in the depths of one’s soul. Only by thoroughly breaking private interests and establishing public interests can one truly fight for Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line and die for Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line. Bao Longkui said this and did this. In a battle to rescue a train carrying toxic pesticides that caught fire, he “knowing that fire burns people, rushed into the fire, seeing that poison hurts people, stood in the poisonous smoke,” and he always fought in the “dangerous zone” where the fire was the biggest and the smoke was the thickest, winning a first-class merit.

Firmly implement Chairman Mao’s cadre policy, boldly promoting cadres who are unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line.

Chairman Mao teaches us: “The cadre policy of the Communist Party should be based on whether one can firmly implement the Party’s line, obey the Party’s discipline, and have close ties with the masses, have independent working ability, be active and hardworking, and not seek personal gain as the standard. This is the line of ‘selecting the best.’” The Party Committee of the First Battalion strictly implements Chairman Mao’s teachings when selecting cadres. They say: “To see if a cadre is good or not, one should see if his consciousness of class and line struggle is high or not.”

In 1964, after the counter-revolutionary revisionist Luo Ruiqing stirred up the black wind of large-scale military exercises, he promoted some military technology “experts” to the sky and forced the troops to promote those who were supposedly “good-looking, good at speaking, had skills, and had tiger spirit.” The Party Committee of the First Battalion, facing this anti-Mao Zedong Thought current, carried out a resolute resistance. They insisted on promoting the active study of Mao Zedong Thought model of the entire battalion, machine gun company platoon leader Xiao Yunshan, as a platoon leader, which was a prominent example.

Xiao Yunshan is the son of a poor peasant and had only attended three years of winter school before enlisting. In 1960, after enlisting, he poured his unlimited love, belief, admiration, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao into studying Chairman Mao’s books, learning and applying them word by word, breaking private interests and establishing public interests, consciously transforming his worldview, and quickly becoming a firm-five-good soldier praised by the masses as a “living Lei Feng.” However, some people thought that “Xiao Yunshan had no ability and could not come up with any tricks,” and “was not humble and did not accept new things,” opposing the promotion of Xiao Yunshan as a platoon leader.

Facing this situation, the Party Committee of the First Battalion believed that this was not a matter of promoting or not promoting Xiao Yunshan, but a matter of the struggle between the two lines, and a matter of the construction of the entire cadre corps. Therefore, they convened an enlarged meeting of the Party Committee, first studying Chairman Mao’s statements on cadre policy and the five conditions for the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause, and then conducting a specific analysis in combination with the actual situation.

Was it that “Xiao Yunshan had no ability and could not come up with any tricks”? The Party Committee guided everyone to use Mao Zedong Thought as a guide, analyzed Xiao Yunshan’s work situation, and clarified what ability is and what kind of ability we need to strengthen the revolutionary construction of the troops. In 1964, Xiao Yunshan was transferred to the relatively poor Third Platoon as a platoon leader. He followed Chairman Mao’s teaching that “the more difficult the place, the more we should go” and happily went to the Third Platoon. He seriously organized the entire platoon to study and apply Chairman Mao’s works, armed the soldiers’ minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and focused on the ideological revolutionization of people, carrying out the “one helps one, one pair of reds” activity, which significantly changed the spiritual face of the entire platoon, and quickly made it the advanced platoon of the entire company. Through learning and discussion, everyone further realized that the ability to guide work with Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest ability.

Was it that Xiao Yunshan was “not humble and did not accept new things”? It was completely not the case. Everyone cited an incident: The counter-revolutionary revisionist Luo Ruiqing advocated learning from military technology “experts.” Xiao Yunshan proposed in the platoon: We will not learn. He said: Whoever holds high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, we will learn from them. Our platoon needs the experience of studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works and promoting ideological revolutionization. The facts proved that Xiao Yunshan insisted on principles, insisted on struggle, and insisted on Chairman Mao’s military line. Everyone said: Xiao Yunshan has a high consciousness of line struggle, is most sensitive to things that deviate from Chairman Mao’s military line, and struggles the most resolutely. The selection of cadres should select such comrades.

This enlarged meeting of the Party Committee had a profound impact on cadre education. Everyone unanimously believed: Always thinking of Chairman Mao, always listening to Chairman Mao, always following Chairman Mao, being unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao. Such cadres have the best morals and the highest talents and are the best cadres.

After Xiao Yunshan became a platoon leader, he insisted on studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely took the road of emphasizing proletarian politics. In the first year, he made the relatively poor Second Platoon leap into the ranks of the four-good units. Last year, Xiao Yunshan led the entire platoon to carry out the tasks of “supporting the left” and “supporting agriculture” in three communes and fourteen production brigades, enthusiastically propagated Chairman Mao’s latest instructions, and, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, focused on revolution and vigorously promoted production, receiving the praise of the broad revolutionary masses. In the battle to rescue the train carrying toxic pesticides that caught fire, he led the entire platoon to fight against the fierce fire and poisonous smoke, undergoing a severe test. Xiao Yunshan won a first-class merit, and the entire platoon won a collective second-class merit.

“What Chairman Mao advocates, we will establish and propagate; what Chairman Mao needs, we will cultivate and promote; what Chairman Mao criticizes, we will help and educate; what Chairman Mao opposes, we will resist and struggle.” This is the principle that the Party Committee of the First Battalion has always followed. They repeatedly organized everyone to thoroughly criticize the feudalist and cliquish “nepotism” cadre line of the bourgeoisie, thoroughly criticize the cadre policy of the bourgeoisie that only emphasizes business and technology and does not care about political and ideological issues, and mobilized the masses to resolutely defend Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line. For cadres who hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize proletarian politics, and have revolutionary enthusiasm, the Party Committee of the battalion boldly promoted them to key leadership positions. The Party Committee of the First Battalion believed that we are Chairman Mao’s army, and our cadres must be unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line. Only by letting such cadres lead can we ensure that our army always follows Chairman Mao and successfully completes all the tasks given by Chairman Mao.

    在阶级斗争和路线斗争中建设无限忠于毛主席的干部队伍
    ——解放军济南部队学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会先进集体某部一营培养干部的体会
    毛主席教导我们：“无产阶级革命事业的接班人，是在群众斗争中产生的，是在革命大风大浪的锻炼中成长的。”人民解放军济南部队活学活用毛泽东思想先进集体——某部一营党委，遵循毛主席的教导，一贯重视在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中，培养和建设无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的干部队伍。在阶级斗争的风浪中，全营干部的阶级斗争观念不断增强，路线斗争觉悟不断提高，部队的革命化建设越搞越好，胜利地完成了各项任务，在保卫无产阶级文化大革命的斗争中又为人民荣立了集体二等功。
    这个营党委培养和建设无限忠于毛主席的干部队伍的体会是：
    用毛主席的无产阶级革命路线教育干部，不断提高干部的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟
    毛主席教导我们：“在社会主义这个历史阶段中，还存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，存在着社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争，存在着资本主义复辟的危险性。……我们从现在起，必须年年讲，月月讲，天天讲，使我们对这个问题，有比较清醒的认识，有一条马克思列宁主义的路线。”一营党委学习了毛主席的教导，从阶级斗争的实践中认识到：无产阶级专政条件下革命的主要对象是党内一小撮走资派，所以，在无产阶级专政条件下的阶级斗争，突出地、集中地表现为党内两条路线的斗争。没有路线斗争观念，阶级斗争观念就是抽象的，不彻底的，就会长了脑袋分不清敌我，长了眼睛看不清方向，容易被打着“红旗”反红旗的党内走资派所蒙蔽。因此，营党委给新提拔的干部上的第一课，就是阶级斗争和路线斗争课，让干部牢记毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他们说：领导上要关心和爱护干部，千关心，万关心，对干部加强阶级斗争和路线斗争教育是最大的关心；千爱护，万爱护，从根本上提高干部的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟是最大的爱护。
    营长杨学成从小逃荒要饭，是毛主席把他从苦海中解放出来的。他怀着无限热爱毛主席的赤心参了军。入伍后，作战勇敢，负过伤，立过战功；平时工作积极，任劳任怨。但是，在反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿刮起大比武黑风时，他一时辨不清方向了，埋头抓军训，不大关心政治思想建设。营党委为这事专门召开了党委会议。会上，委员们以毛主席的光辉著作《关于纠正党内的错误思想》和一九六○年中央军委扩大会议《关于加强军队政治思想工作的决议》为武器，批评了杨学成的单纯军事观点。大家谈到在解放战争时期一次战斗中，一营担任阻击任务，由于战前进行了诉苦运动，提高了干部战士的阶级觉悟，并懂得这次战役的战略意义，在兄弟部队的支援和配合下，全营指战员奋战三昼夜，顶住了敌人十四个团的轮番进攻，歼敌一千四百余名，出色地完成了阻击任务，荣立了大功，被誉为“钢铁第一营”。大家说：过去打胜仗靠政治，靠人的觉悟，靠勇敢、不怕死，现在建设部队还是要靠这些。同志们满腔热情的帮助，使杨学成提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，认识到自己埋头抓训练是转了向。他说：“一个领导干部，没有路线斗争觉悟，就没有辨别能力，就是最大的糊涂人，就会办最大的错事，就会对毛主席不忠。”以后，杨学成主动和教导员一起抓部队活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，一起抓落实林副主席关于突出政治的指示，组织部队彻底批判反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿散布的修正主义谬论。
    后来，营党委派杨学成参加地方的社会主义教育运动，让他在群众斗争的大风浪里去提高阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟。农村两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，使他更加认清了社会主义阶段阶级斗争的尖锐性、复杂性。他从广大贫下中农和革命干部抗黑风，顶逆流，坚持走社会主义道路的大量事实中，学习了他们无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的坚定立场；也从有的干部“只抓粮棉油，不抓敌我友”以致在政治上堕落的事实中吸取了教训。杨学成深刻地认识到：一个领导干部只有把阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟提得高高的，才能弥天浓雾不转向，狂风恶浪不偏航；如果没有阶级斗争和路线斗争观念，就没有灵魂，就会走上危害革命的邪路。
    去年三月，一营在某县担负八个区、七十七个公社、五百六十八个生产大队的“支左”“支农”任务。当时这个地区两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争很激烈。杨学成和大家一起坚定地执行和捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，受到了广大群众的赞扬。
      遵照毛主席关于“共产党员应该经风
  雨，见世面”的教导，让干部到火热的群众
  斗争中去锻炼
    毛主席教导我们：“我们共产党员应该经风雨，见世面；这个风雨，就是群众斗争的大风雨，这个世面，就是群众斗争的大世面。”一营党委遵照毛主席的教导，大胆放手地让干部到群众阶级斗争的大风大浪里去锻炼。他们把轰轰烈烈的群众阶级斗争，看作是培养干部的大课堂，检验干部的大考场，锻炼干部的大熔炉。在那里，教员最多，教材最活，考题最硬。让干部到火热的群众阶级斗争中去经风雨，见世面，还是让干部脱离阶级斗争“闭门修养”，这是在培养干部问题上的两条路线的斗争。因此，他们坚决把干部撒出去，指导干部在阶级斗争中自觉地破私立公，在阶级斗争中锤炼无限忠于毛主席的红心。
    副指导员包龙奎，一九六二年入伍前是个小学教员。毛主席发出“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召，营党委就让他同另外一些干部到驻地附近的某中学去执行支左任务，让他在火热的斗争中经受锻炼。
    包龙奎刚到学校时，怕说错了话，革命小将揪自己的辫子，工作不大胆。营的领导发现后，立即和他一起学习毛主席关于培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的教导，启发他向革命小将学习，去掉“怕”字，换上
  “敢”字，勇于锻炼改造自己。包龙奎学了毛主席的教导，下定决心，自觉锻炼，主动向革命师生亮了自己的私心，听取大家的批评。此后，他积极宣传毛主席的最新指示，和革命师生一起，把学校的文化大革命不断推向前进。
    去年，当全营介入某县无产阶级文化大革命时，营党委又把包龙奎单独放在情况复杂、斗争尖锐的供销系统去执行支左任务。当时，这里的三个革命群众组织，在资本主义复辟逆流中已被取缔了两个，群众的革命积极性受到了压抑。他对照“十六条”进行了反复的研究，认为取缔这两个组织是不符合毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的，应该给他们平反。可是当他准备为这两个组织平反时，又犹豫起来了，怕弄不好惹来乱子。这时，他想起了毛主席“我们的责任，是向人民负责”的教导，认为为这两个组织平反，就是“向人民负责”，就是站在毛主席的革命路线一边，就是对毛主席的忠；不为这两个组织平反，就是对人民不负责，就是站在资产阶级反动路线一边，就是对毛主席不忠。于是，他立即向营里报告，得到了领导上的支持，果断地给这两个组织平了反，受到了广大革命群众的拥护。接着，包龙奎又帮助这三个组织在毛泽东思想的原则基础上实现了革命的大联合。这时，不甘心失败的一小撮阶级敌人，利用包龙奎在促进革命大联合过程中的某些缺点，挑动少数群众，攻击包龙奎，破坏革命大联合。包龙奎面对这种情况，产生了怕困难的情绪。营党委书记、教导员芦贵芝知道这个情况后，就和他一起学习毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，帮助他分析了问题的实质，鼓励他带领群众勇敢前进。包龙奎克服了畏难情绪，主动向群众检查了自己的缺点，并积极宣传毛主席的最新指示，向群众进行深入细致的思想政治工作，巩固了革命的大联合，孤立和打击了一小撮阶级敌人。
    群众阶级斗争的大风浪，有力地促进了包龙奎的思想革命化。营党委帮助他总结经验时，他深深体会到：火热的群众斗争，最能触及自己的灵魂，在火热的群众斗争中，应该自觉地、勇敢地冲刷灵魂深处的污泥浊水。只有彻底破私立公，才能真正生为毛主席的革命路线而战斗，死为毛主席的革命路线而献身。包龙奎是这么说，也是这么做。在一次抢救剧毒农药失火列车的战斗中，他“明知火烧人，偏向火海冲，眼看毒伤人，偏立毒烟中”，他始终战斗在火最大烟最浓的“险区”，荣立了一等功。
      坚决执行毛主席的干部政策，把无限
  忠于毛主席革命路线的干部大胆提拔起来
    毛主席教导我们：“共产党的干部政策，应是以能否坚决地执行党的路线，服从党的纪律，和群众有密切的联系，有独立的工作能力，积极肯干，不谋私利为标准，这就是‘任人唯贤’的路线。”一营党委在选拔干部时坚决按照毛主席的这个教导办事。他们说：
  “看一个干部好不好，就是要看他的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟高不高。”
    一九六四年，反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿在刮起大比武黑风以后，把一些军事技术“尖子”捧上了天，硬要部队把所谓“长相好，口才好，有技术，有虎劲”的人进行大提拔。一营党委面对这股反毛泽东思想的逆流，进行了坚决的抵制。他们坚持把全营活学活用毛泽东思想标兵、机枪连班长萧云山提拔起来当排长，就是突出的一例。
    萧云山是个贫农的儿子，入伍前只上过三年冬学。一九六○年入伍后，他把对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的无产阶级感情倾注在读毛主席的书上，一字一句地学，一字一句地用，破私立公，自觉地改造世界观，很快就成长为一个思想过得硬的五好战士，被群众誉为“活雷锋”。可是，有人却认为“萧云山没有能力，拿不出什么套套”，“不虚心，不接受新鲜事物”，反对提拔萧云山担任排长。
    面对这种情况，一营党委认为，这不是提不提拔萧云山的问题，而是关系到两条路线斗争的大问题，是整个干部队伍的建设问题。于是，他们召开党委扩大会，首先学习了毛主席关于干部政策的论述和无产阶级革命事业接班人的五个条件，联系实际，进行了具体分析。
    是“萧云山没有能力，拿不出什么套套”吗？党委引导大家以毛泽东思想为指针，分析了萧云山的工作情况，弄清什么是能力，我们加强部队革命化建设要什么样的能力。一九六四年，萧云山被调到全连较差的三班当班长，他遵照毛主席“越是困难的地方越是要去”的教导，愉快地到了三班。他认真地组织全班活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装战士头脑，狠抓人的思想革命化，开展了“一帮一、一对红”活动，使全班的精神面貌有了显著改变，很快跃为全连的先进班，全班人人都成为五好战士。通过学习讨论，大家进一步认识到，能用毛泽东思想指导工作是最大的能力。
    是萧云山“不虚心，不接受新鲜事物”吗？也完全不是。大家举了这样一件事：反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿鼓吹部队向军事技术“尖子”学习。萧云山在班里提出：我们不学。他说：谁高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗就向谁学习，我们班需要的是活学活用毛主席著作，搞好思想革命化的经验。事实证明，萧云山坚持原则，坚持斗争，坚持了毛主席的建军路线。大家说：萧云山路线斗争觉悟高，对违背毛主席建军路线的事最敏感，斗争最坚决。选拔干部就是要选拔这样的同志。
    这次党委扩大会，对干部教育极深，大家一致认为：时时想着毛主席，事事听从毛主席，步步紧跟毛主席，无限忠于毛主席，这样的干部，德最好，才最高，是最好的干部。
    萧云山当排长以后，坚持活学活用毛泽东思想，坚决走突出无产阶级政治的道路，第一年就使较差的二排跃入了四好行列。去年，萧云山带领全排在三个公社十四个生产大队执行“支左”“支农”任务，热情宣传毛主席的最新指示，和贫下中农一起狠抓革命，猛促生产，受到了广大革命群众的赞扬。在抢救剧毒农药失火的战斗中，他带领全排奋战烈火毒烟，经受了严峻考验。萧云山荣立了一等功，全排立了集体二等功。
      “毛主席提倡的，我们就树立就宣传；毛主席需要的，我们就培养就提拔；毛主席批评的，我们就帮助就教育；毛主席反对的，我们就抵制就斗争。”这是一营党委一贯遵循的原则。他们一次又一次地组织大家彻底批判山头主义、宗派主义的“任人唯亲”的资产阶级干部路线，彻底批判只重业务技术，不问政治思想的资产阶级干部政策，发动群众坚决地捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。对高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗、突出无产阶级政治、有革命干劲的干部，营党委就大胆地把他提到关键性的领导岗位上来。一营党委认为，我们是毛主席的军队，我们的干部必须是无限忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席革命路线的干部，只有让这样的干部来领导，才能保证我们军队永远紧跟毛主席，圆满完成毛主席所给的一切任务。
