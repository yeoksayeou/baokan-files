The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The reform of state organs, the most fundamental point, is to link up with the masses." Under the guidance of the propaganda team of the People's Liberation Army from a certain unit, the Revolutionary Committee of Nanjing Red Flag Cement Plant has carried forward the fine tradition of our Party of closely linking with the masses, delved into actual conditions, and into the masses, insisted on participating in collective production, and thus strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses, promoting both revolution and production. Since its establishment, the Revolutionary Committee has completed its production tasks ahead of schedule every month.

When the Revolutionary Committee was established in mid-February this year, due to the influence of bourgeois ideology and old habits, some members proposed to set up a "decent" organization, while others were busy reading documents and issuing orders in the office, gradually reducing their contact with the masses. After discovering this trend, the propaganda team of the People's Liberation Army helped them organize a Mao Zedong Thought study class to re-study Chairman Mao's teachings on the mass line. In the study class, the members of the Revolutionary Committee took Comrade Jiao Yulu, a good student of Mao Zedong, as their example, and the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party as their negative example, for comparison. They realized that whether or not they could adhere to the mass line, whether or not they could be closely linked with the masses, and whether or not they could represent the interests of the masses, were all big issues related to whether or not they could implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Through the study, the leading members of the Revolutionary Committee of this plant, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "being both an official and a common person," formulated a set of regulations for linking with the masses. The Revolutionary Committee stipulated that each member should determine a production post as their "base point," working and fighting together with the masses; in addition to adhering to their own study system, the members of the Revolutionary Committee participate in the masses' evening Mao Zedong Thought study classes every day, taking the lead in criticizing and repudiating revisionism and the bourgeoisie; the Revolutionary Committee designated Sunday as the day for visiting the masses, going deep into the family quarters, having heart-to-heart talks with the masses, soliciting their opinions, and listening to their criticisms. The members of the Revolutionary Committee in each workshop also work in work clothes with the masses every day, going to where the work is difficult. The members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Mining Workshop are divided into three shifts to work in shifts. In this workshop, the most dangerous process during stone mining is drilling and blasting, and the director of the Revolutionary Committee of the workshop took the initiative to participate in this work.

In their work, the members of the Revolutionary Committee humbly learn from the workers, becoming the workers' little students, and collect the workers' opinions on revolution and production, and then persist in implementing them among the masses. A member of the Revolutionary Committee, while visiting the families of the workers, discovered that an old worker held a family Mao Zedong Thought study class, and the effect of strengthening class education for his children was very good. He then publicized this advanced experience everywhere, inspiring many workers to set up family study classes, promoting the revolutionization of thought.

    南京红旗水泥厂革委会遵循毛主席教导“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”
    坚持参加集体生产　密切联系群众
    革委会成员在劳动中处处听取群众意见，接受群众监督，改进自己的工作
    据新华社南京电　伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”南京红旗水泥厂革命委员会在人民解放军某部毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，发扬我党密切联系群众的优良传统，深入实际，深入群众，坚持参加集体生产劳动，密切了干群关系，推动了革命和生产。革委会成立以来，月月超额完成了生产任务。
    红旗水泥厂在今年二月中旬成立革命委员会时，由于资产阶级思想和旧习惯势力的影响，有的成员提出要搞一套“象样”的机构，有的忙于在办公室里看文件，批条子，同群众的联系逐渐减少了。驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队发现这种倾向后，就帮助他们举办毛泽东思想学习班，重新学习毛主席有关群众路线的教导。在学习班里，革委会成员以毛主席的好学生焦裕禄同志为榜样，以党内一小撮走资派为反面教员，进行对照。他们认识到：能不能坚持走群众路线，能不能和群众血肉相连，能不能代表群众的利益，这是关系到能不能贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的大问题。
    通过学习，这个厂革命委员会的领导成员，按照毛主席“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的教导，制订了一套联系群众的制度。革命委员会规定：每个委员都确定一个生产岗位，作为自己的“基点”，和群众劳动在一起，战斗在一起；革命委员会的成员除坚持本身的学习制度外，每天参加群众的业余毛泽东思想学习班，带头斗私批修；革命委员会把星期日作为走访群众日，深入家属宿舍，和群众谈心交心，征求群众意见，听取群众批评。各车间的革委会成员也是每天穿着工作服同群众一起劳动，那里工作有困难，他们就到那里去。矿山车间革委会把全体领导成员分成三个班，顶班劳动。这个车间在采石的时候，打眼放炮这道工序最危险，车间革委会主任就主动参加了这项劳动。
    革委会成员在劳动中，老老实实拜工人为师，当工人的小学生，把工人对革命和生产的意见集中起来，再拿到群众中坚持下去。革委会有位同志在访问职工家庭时，发现有位老工人举办家庭毛泽东思想学习班，加强对子女的阶级教育效果很好。他就到处宣传这个先进事迹，带动了很多工人纷纷举办家庭学习班，促进了思想革命化。
