The International Monetary Fund was established in December 1945. It is nominally a specialized agency of the "United Nations," claiming to "stabilize international finance and promote international trade." In reality, it is a tool used by American imperialism to manipulate the finances of the capitalist world and serve its policies of aggression and expansion. Currently, it has 107 member countries and regions.

According to the regulations, the voting rights of each member country are determined by the amount of quota they contribute. Since the United States holds the largest quota in the fund, it alone accounts for about one-quarter of the total voting rights, thereby gaining decisive control over this organization. Furthermore, according to the regulations, all member countries must also accept the supervision of this organization in matters of currency adjustments and the implementation of foreign exchange controls.

    国际货币基金组织
    “国际货币基金组织”成立于一九四五年十二月。它名义上是“联合国”的一个专门机构，以“稳定国际金融、促进国际贸易”相标榜，实际上则是美帝国主义用来操纵资本主义世界的金融、为其侵略和扩张政策服务的一个工具。目前，它的成员有一百零七个国家和地区。
    根据规定，各成员国的表决权按它们所分担的基金份额多少来决定。由于美国在基金中所占份额最大，它一国就占了总投票权的四分之一左右，从而在这个机构中取得了决定性的控制权。另外，根据规定，所有成员国在变动币制和实施外汇管制方面也必须接受这个组织的监督。　（据新华社）
