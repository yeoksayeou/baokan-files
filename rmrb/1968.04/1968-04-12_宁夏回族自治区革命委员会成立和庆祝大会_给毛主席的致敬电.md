To the Most Beloved Great Leader Chairman Mao:

Today, under your loving care, in the great march to achieve complete victory in the nationwide Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, at the foot of the last great mountain you crossed during the Long March—Mount Liupan—the Revolutionary Committee of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has been born in victory!

On this grand occasion, we, with boundless affection, sing a thousand and ten thousand times the brilliant poem you wrote during the Long March, "The Plum Blossom in the Cold Mountains":

The sky is high, the clouds are light,
Looking for the south-bound geese in vain.
To reach the Great Wall is no small task,
The journey of twenty thousand miles is counted on the fingers.
On the high peaks of Mount Liupan, the red flag is unfurled by the west wind.
Today, the long whip is in hand,
When will the dragon be captured?

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Thirty-two years ago, you wrote this immortal poem, inspiring us to victory after victory. On this joyous day of celebrating the birth of the Revolutionary Committee, we miss you more than ever! Standing on the towering Mount Liupan, we seem to see you waving to us affectionately, as if we hear your earnest teachings. We shout with joy, we sing aloud:

Hail your brilliant thoughts and revolutionary line achieving another great victory!
Sing of your latest instructions bearing fruit in the "River and Lake in the Frontier"!
Hail the glorious People's Liberation Army, led by you, creating another great feat in the "three supports, two militaries" work!

A thousand cheers, ten thousand songs, most sincerely, we wish you, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Looking back at the revolutionary journey, which step was not led by you to cross the rapids and dangers? Reflecting on the years of struggle, which moment was not guided by your brilliant thoughts to victory?

It was you who led the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army on the Long March of twenty-five thousand miles, sowing the seeds of revolution across the country, igniting the flames of revolution everywhere. Your glorious image constantly inspires us to press forward bravely!

It was you who, in the revolutionary holy land of Yan'an, led us in the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region and all revolutionary people of China to overthrow the three great mountains of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat capitalism, establishing the new China of proletarian dictatorship.

It was you who led us to smash the plot of a handful of counter-revolutionaries disguised in religious robes. Your brilliant thoughts shine over the mountains and rivers of Ningxia. The red flags of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes flutter in the wind, making this long-suffering minority region, once cruelly exploited by the Chiang-Ma bandits, develop rapidly and leap forward!

It was you who, at the critical moment when domestic and foreign class enemies stirred up black winds and thick fog, in 1961, rewrote "The Plum Blossom in the Cold Mountains" for the revolutionary people of Ningxia. The magnificent momentum and fighting spirit in it inspired us to hoist high the revolutionary banner of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism, and carry the revolution through to the end!

It was you who, with the greatest courage and daring of a great proletarian revolutionary, personally initiated and led the unprecedented, world-shaking Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, opening a new era in the international communist movement! The Ningxia proletarian revolutionary factions, revolutionary Red Guards, and revolutionary masses of all ethnic groups, who are loyal to the end, followed your battle cry of "Bombard the Headquarters," launching a general offensive against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party in Ningxia, such as Yang Jingren and Ma Yushu, and thoroughly smashing their dreams of restoring capitalism!

Beloved Chairman Mao! In the days when the handful of capitalist-roaders fiercely counterattacked, we listened, day and night, to your battle cries! We read, hungrily and thirstily, your four volumes of writings! With a red sun in our hearts, we dare to brave the knife mountains and fire seas! In countless severe tests, we practiced the magnificent oath to defend you and your proletarian revolutionary line: "Heads may roll, but our cause is just. Forever follow Chairman Mao, revolutionary to the end, never wavering!"

At the critical moment of the life-and-death struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! You timely sent the people's liberation army, firmly supporting and protecting the proletarian revolutionary factions. A thousand good things are not as good as the liberation army, parents are not as dear as you! A thousand songs, ten thousand songs, they cannot sing enough of your boundless kindness, they cannot sing enough of the deep bond between the army and the people!

At the crucial moment when the nationwide Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution achieved decisive victory, beloved Chairman Mao, you issued a series of latest instructions. On the eve of the brilliant year of 1968, you personally approved the Central Committee's decision on the issue of Ningxia, which is your greatest concern, encouragement, support, and spur for us, a beacon lighting our way forward! You issued a command, and the revolutionary people responded in unison: Compliance! Compliance! Resolutely compliance!

Beloved Chairman Mao! Look at Ningxia today: your brilliant thoughts and revolutionary line have never been more deeply rooted in people's hearts. Your latest instructions have already become the conscious actions of millions of revolutionary people. We are following your great strategic deployment, advancing with songs and roars. In this great situation, we welcome the victorious birth of the Revolutionary Committee of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region!

The establishment of the Revolutionary Committee is only the starting point of a new battle journey. Greater historical tasks await us. Revolutionary history has written an unbreakable truth: "Navigating the vast ocean relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." Beloved Chairman Mao: We will definitely take Comrade Lin Biao as a shining example, forever loyal to you, forever loyal to your brilliant thoughts, forever loyal to your proletarian revolutionary line. We will further carry out the mass movement of studying and applying your brilliant thoughts, further implement your latest instructions, and plant your brilliant red flag throughout the mountains and rivers of Ningxia, letting the brilliant sunshine of your thoughts forever shine over the "River and Lake in the Frontier"!

Beloved Chairman Mao! We solemnly pledge to you: We will forever remember your teachings: "Never forget class struggle," and speak of it year after year, month after month, day after day. We will definitely carry out your proletarian revolutionary line, further criticize the capitalist reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev, deeply carry out the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, thoroughly expose and criticize the heinous crimes of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and their agents in Ningxia, making them never able to rise again! We will resolutely oppose right opportunism, right opportunist splittism, and right opportunist capitulationism. We will strengthen our vigilance against the enemy, enhance the unity of all ethnic groups, strengthen the proletarian dictatorship, and prevent the sabotage of the special agents of the U.S., Chiang, the Soviet revisionists, and the Mongolian revisionists. We will root out all traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and all counter-revolutionaries.

Beloved Chairman Mao! We solemnly pledge to you: We will "criticize and repent," persistently run various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, advocate the revolutionary spirit of learning, study and apply the "Old Five Articles," and strive to change our worldview. We will emphasize the education of the struggle between the two lines, strengthen proletarian party spirit, overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, further consolidate and develop the great alliance and the three-in-one combination of the revolution, and do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of each unit. We will seriously rectify the party organization, strengthen party building, grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness. We will emphasize proletarian politics, advocate frugality for revolution, and oppose economism. We will raise higher the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, and seize victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization!

Beloved Chairman Mao! We solemnly pledge to you: We will resolutely respond to your great call of "Support the Army, Love the People," strengthen military-civilian unity, and thoroughly smash the evil plots of the class enemies to sabotage the Great Wall.

Beloved Chairman Mao! We solemnly pledge to you: We will resolutely carry out your recent important instructions on the revolutionary committees, seize power for the proletariat, use power for the proletariat, and build the revolutionary committees into strong revolutionary command posts that hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Our red hearts fly to Beijing, a thousand songs and ten thousand songs sing of you. Most sincerely, we wish you, our great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman, eternal life! Eternal life!

    给毛主席的致敬电最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席：
    今天，在您的亲切关怀下，在夺取全国无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大进军中，在您长征越过的最后一座高山——六盘山下，宁夏回族自治区革命委员会胜利诞生了！
      在这盛大的节日里，我们怀着无限的深情，千遍万遍地高歌您长征时写下的光辉诗篇《清平乐·六盘山》：天高云淡，望断南飞雁。不到长城非好汉，屈指行程二万。六盘山上高峰，红旗漫卷西风。今日长缨在手，何时缚住苍龙？
      毛主席啊，毛主席！三十二年前您写下的不朽诗篇，鼓舞我们从胜利走向胜利。在这欢庆革命委员会诞生的大喜日子里，我们格外格外想念您！登上巍巍六盘山，我们仿佛看见您在向我们亲切招手，好象听见您的谆谆教导。我们纵情欢呼，我们放声歌唱：
      欢呼您的光辉思想和革命路线取得又一伟大胜利！
      歌唱您的最新指示在“塞上江南”结下了丰硕果实！
      欢呼您亲手缔造的英雄的中国人民解放军在“三支”“两军”工作中创建了又一丰功伟绩！
      千声欢呼，万声歌唱，最最衷心地敬祝您老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
      毛主席啊，毛主席！回顾革命的历程，哪
  一程不是您率领我们越过急流险滩！回想战斗的岁月，哪一刻不是您的光辉思想指引我们胜利前进！
      是您，率领中国工农红军，长征二万五千里，在全国播下革命的火种，燃起燎原的烈火。您的光辉形象，时时刻刻激励我们勇往直前！
      是您，在革命圣地延安，领导我们陕甘宁边区和全中国的革命人民，推翻了帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义三座大山，建立了无产阶级专政的新中国。
    是您，领导我们粉碎了一小撮披着宗教外衣的反革命分子的复辟阴谋。您伟大思想的灿烂阳光，普照宁夏山川，总路线、大跃进、人民公社的红旗迎风招展，使这个长期遭受蒋马匪帮残酷压榨的少数民族地区，一日千里，飞跃发展！
    是您，正当国内外阶级敌人刮起阵阵黑风，卷起重重妖雾的时刻，在一九六一年为宁夏革命人民重新题书了《清平乐·六盘山》。那磅礴的气势，战斗的豪情，鼓舞我们高举反帝反修的革命大旗，将革命进行到底！
      是您，以最伟大的无产阶级革命家的气魄和胆略，亲自发动和领导了史无前例、震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命，开创了国际共产主义运动的新纪元！无限忠于您的宁夏无产阶级革命派、革命的红卫兵小将和各族革命群众，紧跟您《炮打司令部》的战斗号令，向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在宁夏的代理人杨静仁、马玉槐等
  一小撮党内走资本主义道路的当权派发起了总攻击，彻底粉碎了他们复辟资本主义的迷梦！
      敬爱的毛主席！在那一小撮走资派疯狂反扑的日子里，我们听啊，日日夜夜倾听着您的战斗号令！我们读啊，如饥似渴地读着您的雄文四卷！心中有颗红太阳，刀山火海我敢闯！在多少次严峻的考验中，我们实践了保卫您、保卫您的无产阶级革命路线的豪迈誓言：“砍头不要紧，只要主义真。永远紧跟毛主席，革命到底不变心！”
      正当两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线生死搏斗的关头，毛主席啊，毛主席！您及时派来了亲人解放军，坚决支持和保护无产阶级革命派。千好万好不如解放军好，爹亲娘亲不如您老人家亲！千支歌，万支歌，唱不尽您的恩情似海深，唱不尽军民骨肉亲！
      正当全国无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的关键时刻，敬爱的毛主席，您发出了一系列最新指示。在光辉灿烂的一九六八年到来的前夕，您亲自批发了中央关于宁夏问题的决定，这是您对我们的最大关怀、最大鼓舞、最大支持、最大鞭策，这是照亮我们前进道路的一盏明灯！您发出一声号令，革命人民齐响应：照办！照办！坚决照办！
      敬爱的毛主席！喜看今日宁夏：您的光辉思想和革命路线空前深入人心。您的最新指示已经变成千百万革命人民的自觉行动。我们正紧跟您的伟大战略部署，高歌猛进。在这一派大好形势下，迎来了宁夏回族自治区革命委员会的胜利诞生！
      革命委员会的成立，这只是新的战斗历程的起点，更伟大的历史任务等待着我们去承担。革命的历史写下了一条颠扑不破的真理：
  “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”敬爱的毛主席：我们一定以林副主席为光辉榜样，永远忠于您，永远忠于您的伟大思想，永远忠于您的无产阶级革命路线。我们要更加深入地开展活学活用您的光辉思想的群众运动，进一步落实您的最新指示，把您的光辉思想的伟大红旗插遍宁夏的山山水水，让您的思想的灿烂阳光永远照耀“塞上江南”！
      敬爱的毛主席！我们向您庄严宣誓：要永远牢记您的教导：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”，要年年讲，月月讲，天天讲。我们一定坚决贯彻执行您的无产阶级革命路线，进一步批判中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线，深入进行两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，把党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在宁夏代理人的滔天罪行，揭深揭透，批倒批臭，叫他们永世不得翻身！我们要坚决反对右倾保守主义、右倾分裂主义和右倾投降主义。我们要百倍加强敌情观念，提高革命警惕，加强各民族的团结，加强无产阶级专政，严防美蒋、苏修、蒙修特务的破坏，把一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派和一切反革命分子统统挖出来。
      敬爱的毛主席！我们向您庄严宣誓：要“斗私，批修”，坚持不懈地办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，发扬革命的好学风，大学大用“老五篇”，努力改造世界观。要突出两条路线斗争的教育，加强无产阶级党性，克服资产阶级、小资产阶级的派性，进一步巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合，搞好各单位的斗、批、改。要认真整顿党的组织，加强党的建设，狠抓革命，猛促生产，猛促工作，猛促战备。要突出无产阶级政治，节约闹革命，反对经济主义。要更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，从思想上、政治上、经济上、组织上夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
      敬爱的毛主席！我们向您庄严宣誓：坚决响应您“拥军爱民”的伟大号召，大力加强军民团结，彻底粉碎阶级敌人妄想破坏伟大长城的罪恶阴谋。
      敬爱的毛主席！我们向您庄严宣誓：坚决贯彻执行您最近关于革命委员会的重要指示，为无产阶级掌好权，用好权，把革命委员会建设成为高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的坚强的革命指挥部。
      毛主席啊，毛主席！红心飞向北京城，千歌万曲歌唱您。最最衷心地祝愿您啊，我们伟大的导师，伟大的领袖，伟大的统帅，伟大的舵手万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    宁夏回族自治区革命委员会成立和庆祝大会
