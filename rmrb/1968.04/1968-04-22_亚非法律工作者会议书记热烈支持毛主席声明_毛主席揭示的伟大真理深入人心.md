	Secretary of the Asian-African Legal Workers' Conference Strongly Supports Chairman Mao's Statement
	Chairman Mao's Great Truths Penetrate People's Hearts

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Conakry, April 20th - The Secretary of the Standing Committee of the Executive Committee of the Asian-African Legal Workers' Conference, Viyanto, said in an interview with Xinhua News Agency reporters in Conakry on the 20th: "Chairman Mao Zedong's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence has great historical significance. This statement is not only a great encouragement and inspiration to American blacks, but also a great encouragement and inspiration to the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and other regions of the world who are fighting against colonialism and imperialism led by the United States."

	Viyanto pointed out that the fact that Martin Luther King Jr., a non-violent advocate, was brutally assassinated by fascist violence once again shows American blacks and people of other countries that non-violence is absolutely no match for imperialism and the monopoly bourgeoisie.

	Viyanto emphasized: "Now, the great truth revealed by Chairman Mao, 'Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun,' has deeply penetrated the hearts of the people of various countries. Under the guidance of this brilliant idea, the armed struggle of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America is flourishing."

	Viyanto concluded by saying, "We must respond to Chairman Mao's great call to 'Unite all the people of the world, launch a sustained and fierce attack on our common enemy, U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, and thoroughly smash the imperialism headed by U.S. imperialism."

    亚非法律工作者会议书记热烈支持毛主席声明
    毛主席揭示的伟大真理深入人心
    据新华社科纳克里二十日电　亚非法律工作者会议执行委员会常设书记处书记维扬托二十日在科纳克里对新华社记者发表谈话时说：“毛泽东主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明具有伟大的历史意义。这个声明不仅对美国黑人是一个巨大的声援和鼓舞，而且对正在反对以美国为首的殖民主义和帝国主义的亚、非、拉和世界其他地区的人民来说，同样是一个巨大的声援和鼓舞。”
    维扬托指出，非暴力主义者马丁·路德·金牧师被法西斯暴力残暴地暗杀这一事实，向美国黑人和世界其他各国人民再一次表明，非暴力主义是绝对对付不了帝国主义和垄断资产阶级的。
    维扬托强调指出：“现在，毛主席所揭示的‘枪杆子里面出政权’的伟大真理已在各国人民中深入人心。在这个光辉思想的照耀下，亚非拉人民的武装斗争正在蓬勃发展。
    维扬托最后说，我们必须响应毛主席发出的“全世界人民更紧密地团结起来，向着我们的共同敌人美帝国主义及其帮凶们发动持久的猛烈的进攻”的伟大号召，彻底粉碎以美帝为首的帝国主义。
