Vietnamese newspapers warmly applaud and support the mighty anti-violence struggle of American Blacks.
American Blacks open a new front against U.S. imperialism from within.

Hanoi, April 7 (Xinhua) — The People's Daily and the People's Army Daily of Vietnam both published commentaries on April 7, expressing strong support for the anti-violence struggle of American Blacks.

The commentary in The People's Daily pointed out that as U.S. imperialism finds itself in a desperate situation over the Vietnam issue and faces enormous economic and financial difficulties, the fierce outbreak of the Black struggle has made the Johnson administration even more disoriented.

The commentary said that the Black struggle in the United States is growing stronger and more aware of class and national issues. The broad masses of Blacks are uniting more closely, linking their struggle more tightly with the struggle of the American people for democracy and peace, as well as with the liberation struggles of oppressed nations worldwide. Their struggle has opened a new front against U.S. imperialism within the United States, making the crises facing U.S. imperialism both domestically and internationally even more severe.

The commentary in The People's Army Daily pointed out that at a time when the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression for national salvation is achieving great victories, the fierce struggle of American Blacks in the rear is a new heavy blow to the Washington authorities.

    越南报纸热烈欢呼和支持美国黑人气势磅礴的抗暴斗争
    美国黑人开辟从内部进攻美帝的战线
    新华社河内七日电越南《人民报》和《人民军队报》七日分别发表评论，热烈支持美国黑人的抗暴斗争。
    《人民报》的评论指出，正当美帝在越南问题上陷入走投无路的处境，在经济、财政方面遇到巨大困难的时候，美国黑人斗争的猛烈爆发使约翰逊集团更加狼狈。
    评论说，美国黑人斗争的气势日益强大，阶级、民族觉悟日益提高。广大的黑人日益团结，越来越紧密地同美国人民争取民主与和平的斗争以及世界被压迫民族的解放斗争联系起来。他们的斗争形成了在美国内部进攻美帝国主义的另一条战线，使美帝国主义在国内外面临的危机更加严重。
    《人民军队报》的评论指出，正当越南人民的抗美救国战争取得巨大胜利的时候，在美国的后方猛烈燃烧的美国黑人的斗争，是对华盛顿当局的一个新的沉重打击。
