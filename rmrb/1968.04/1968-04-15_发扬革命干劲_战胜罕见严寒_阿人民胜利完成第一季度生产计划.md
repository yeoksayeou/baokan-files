The heroic people of Albania, under the correct leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Albanian Party of Labour, have, while striving to achieve ideological revolutionization, actively overcome the difficulties brought about by the unprecedented severe cold of last winter and this spring, and have triumphantly fulfilled the production tasks for the first quarter of this year.

On the industrial front, according to materials from relevant departments, in the first quarter, the oil production plan was completed at 101.2 percent, an increase of 16 percent over the same period last year; coal mining was completed at 102.2 percent, an increase of 13.5 percent over the same period last year; chromium ore mining was completed at 104.4 percent, an increase of 14.1 percent over the same period last year; copper ore mining was completed at 117 percent, an increase of 46 percent over the same period last year; the plan for producing copper ingots was completed at 125.9 percent, more than double the same period last year. Workers also overfulfilled the plans for iron ore mining and steel rolling.

Geological survey workers, in their quest to discover the nation's underground treasures, fought a tough battle against the winter cold, working selflessly in the ice and snow, and overfulfilled the exploration plan for the first quarter of this year by 16.5 percent.

The Laç Phosphorus Fertilizer Factory and the Fier Nitrogen Fertilizer Factory, which directly support agricultural production, as well as the recently established Vlora Soda Factory, all overfulfilled their production tasks.

Transportation workers, despite the harsh weather conditions at the beginning of the year, persevered and overcame the difficulties, completing the first quarter's plans for highway freight, railway transport, and ocean shipping on schedule.

The construction sector completed 14.4 percent more construction than the same period last year. Workers from state-owned construction companies in Tirana, Fier, and Elbasan all overfulfilled their construction tasks for the first three months of this year.

Workers in the light industry sector also achieved outstanding production results. The first quarter's production plans for cotton fabric were completed at 105.2 percent, wool fabric at 104.8 percent, and knitted goods at 102.2 percent. Shoe manufacturing, stationery paper, and wood processing all overfulfilled their production plans.

Meanwhile, workers from various industrial and mining enterprises actively implemented the resolutions of the Party's Third Plenum, fostered a spirit of cooperation, carried out technological innovations, and launched socialist competitions between teams, workshops, and units. They also achieved good results in improving product quality, increasing product varieties, reducing costs, and saving raw materials.

On the agricultural front, the broad masses of cooperative members and state farm workers responded enthusiastically to the Party's call to develop agriculture, especially to increase grain production, overcame the difficulties caused by the climate, and made active efforts to increase production in the first quarter. They are now engaged in the intense spring sowing battle.

Now, the Albanian people are further carrying forward their revolutionary spirit, tapping into production potential, and striving for new victories.

The broad masses of women in Albania, through the ideological revolutionization movement, have raised their consciousness and actively participated in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. Female members of the "Victory" Agricultural Cooperative in a certain district are working in the fields, leveling the land, and preparing for sowing.
