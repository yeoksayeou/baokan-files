	In Cuba, American friends say that the American people must carefully study Chairman Mao's great statement, firmly remember Chairman Mao's guidelines on the struggle of black people, and unite to overthrow the evil rule of the monopoly capitalist class.

	New China News Agency, Havana, April 21 - American friends residing in Cuba enthusiastically hail the great leader Chairman Mao's statement of April 16 supporting the struggle of American black people against violence.

	Two American friends residing in Cuba told a reporter from New China News Agency that Chairman Mao's statement is a very important document. They pointed out that the assassination of the black pastor Martin Luther King once again shows the bankruptcy of the policy of pacifism and non-violence. At this critical moment, American black people have launched a new wave of struggle. Chairman Mao's statement is a valuable support for the struggle of American black people. This document provides a profound and inspiring analysis of the current situation and the future, which is a great contribution.

	These two American friends said, "Chairman Mao pointed out: 'The struggle of American black people for liberation is a part of the overall struggle of the people of the world against American imperialism, and a part of the world revolution today.' They went on to say, 'American black people's understanding of this is increasing day by day. They realize from their own experience: 'Like the Vietnamese people, American black people can only achieve complete liberation through persistent, fearless, and long-term struggle.' 'People around the world are beginning to realize that their struggle against imperialism and colonialism is interconnected. The struggle of American black people has helped the struggle of the Vietnamese people, just as the struggle of the Vietnamese people has helped the struggle of American black people.'"

	These two American friends emphasized, "Chairman Mao pointed out: 'The contradiction between the broad masses of black people in the United States and the ruling class of the United States is a class contradiction.' This is a guiding principle that must be remembered now and in the future for the class nature of the struggle of American black people. They said: 'Racial discrimination is a product of imperialism and colonialism. American black people must destroy this institution that has shackled American black people and other Americans for hundreds of years in order to achieve true liberation. Chairman Mao said that among the broad masses of black people, there is an extremely powerful revolutionary force, which is undeniable.'"

	These two American friends finally expressed their sincere hope that all American people will carefully study Chairman Mao's statement, and especially understand and practice this point in the statement, which is: "The broad masses of black people in the United States and the broad laboring people among American whites have common interests and common goals in their struggle. Therefore, the struggle of American black people is gaining more and more sympathy and support from the laboring people and progressive individuals among the white race in the United States. The struggle of American black people will inevitably combine with the American workers' movement and ultimately end the evil rule of the American monopoly capitalist class."

    在古巴的美国朋友说美国人民要仔细学习毛主席伟大声明
    牢记毛主席关于黑人斗争的指导方针
    团结一致推翻垄断资产阶级罪恶统治
    新华社哈瓦那二十一日电　旅居古巴的美国朋友热烈欢呼伟大领袖毛主席四月十六日发表的支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明。
    两位旅居古巴的美国朋友向新华社记者发表谈话说，毛主席的声明是一个极其重要的文件。他们指出，黑人牧师马丁·路德·金被无耻杀害，再次表明和平主义和非暴力政策的破产。在这样的关键时刻，美国黑人掀起了新的斗争风暴。毛主席的这个声明是对美国黑人斗争的可贵的声援。这个文件对当前和未来的远景作了深刻的和鼓舞人心的分析，这是一个伟大的贡献。
    这两位美国朋友说，毛主席指出：“美国黑人争取解放的斗争，是全世界人民反对美帝国主义的总斗争的一个组成部分，是当代世界革命的一个组成部分。”他们接着说，美国黑人对这一点的理解正在不断提高。他们从切身经验认识到：“和越南人民一样，美国黑人只有通过坚持不懈的、不怕牺牲的和长期的斗争，才能取得彻底解放。”“世界各地的人民开始认识到，他们反对帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争是相互联系的。美国黑人的斗争帮助了越南人民的斗争，正如越南人民的斗争帮助了美国黑人的斗争一样。”
    这两位美国朋友强调说，毛主席指出：“美国广大黑人同美国统治集团之间的矛盾，是阶级矛盾。”这是一个指导方针，现在和将来都必须永远记住美国黑人斗争的阶级性。他们说：“种族歧视是帝国主义和殖民主义的产物，美国黑人要取得真正的解放，必须摧毁几百年来束缚美国黑人和其他美国人的这个制度。毛主席说，在广大黑人中，蕴藏着极其强大的革命力量，这是无可辩驳的。”
    这两位美国朋友最后表示殷切希望全体美国人民仔细学习毛主席的这个声明，并且要特别领会和实践声明中的这一点，这就是：“美国广大黑人同美国白人中的广大劳动人民，有着共同的利益和共同的斗争目标。因此，美国黑人的斗争正在获得越来越多的美国白色人种中的劳动人民和进步人士的同情和支持。美国黑人斗争必将同美国工人运动相结合，最终结束美国垄断资产阶级的罪恶统治。”
