The great leader Chairman Mao's statement "In Support of the American Blacks' Struggle Against Violence" is like a thunderclap that shatters the sky and shakes the earth, inspiring the struggle of revolutionary people all over the world.

"The evil system of colonialism and imperialism, which is based on the enslavement and trafficking of blacks, has prospered." Beginning in the 16th century, the inhuman slave trade that lasted for four hundred years brought unprecedented calamities to the entire African continent. From this most serious crime of racial extermination in world history, the evil imperialists obtained their earliest industrial capital. It was precisely by brutally enslaving tens of millions of blacks that American monopoly capital secured a source of cheap labor, plundered tens of billions of super profits, and fattened itself. For centuries, American blacks have been enslaved, oppressed, and discriminated against. The hard work of American blacks has brought them whips, blood, tears, hunger, and unemployment...

Where there is oppression, there is resistance. For centuries, American blacks have waged a tenacious struggle, fighting for freedom and liberation.

From the bloody lessons of history and the harsh realities, American blacks have gradually come to understand: begging the reactionaries for freedom, liberation, and equal rights is like negotiating with a tiger. Only by taking up arms and using revolutionary violence can they defeat the counter-revolutionary violence of the American ruling class and achieve victory. Since the 1957 Little Rock incident in Arkansas, which shocked the world, the scale of the struggle of American blacks has grown larger and larger. Especially since August 8, 1963, when our great leader Chairman Mao issued the statement "In Support of the American Blacks' Just Struggle Against Racial Discrimination by U.S. Imperialism," American blacks have become more awakened and have launched wave after wave of large-scale anti-violence struggles. They have taken up stones, clubs, Molotov cocktails, and guns to replace their former tears, petitions, and prayers. The blacks in New York's Harlem district ignited the flames of anger. The snipers in Los Angeles' Watts district fired bullets of revenge. In Chicago, Detroit, Washington... the flames of struggle have risen again and again.

Our great leader Chairman Mao, on behalf of the 700 million Chinese people, firmly supports the just struggle of American blacks. Chairman Mao's statement speaks for the hearts of the 700 million Chinese people. We enthusiastically endorse it and will carry it out resolutely! Revolutionary people's hearts are connected. The anti-violence struggle of American blacks is a component of the global people's struggle against U.S. imperialism.

American black brothers: The Chinese people pledge to be your rear guard!

"The evil system of colonialism and imperialism, which is based on the enslavement and trafficking of blacks, will also come to an end with the complete liberation of the black race."

History will prove the scientific judgment of our great leader.

American blacks will surely win! U.S. imperialism will surely lose!

    美国黑人斗争必胜！美帝国主义必败！
    纺织工业部大联委
    伟大领袖毛主席《支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明》，象一声春雷，划破长空，震撼大地，鼓舞着全世界革命人民的斗争。
      “万恶的殖民主义、帝国主义制度是随着奴役和贩卖黑人而兴盛起来的”。从十六世纪开始，延续了四百年的灭绝人性的贩运黑人的罪恶买卖，使整个非洲大陆遭受了空前的浩劫。从这一场世界历史上最严重的种族灭绝罪行中，万恶的帝国主义攫取了它最早的工业资金。美国垄断资本也正是靠着对千百万黑人的骇人听闻的奴役，获得了廉价的劳动力来源，掠夺了成千成万亿超额利润，养肥了自己。而几百年来，美国黑人则祖祖辈辈处于被奴役、被压迫和被歧视的地位。美国黑人的辛勤劳动，换来的是皮鞭，是血泪，是饥饿，是失业……。
    哪里有压迫，哪里就有反抗。几百年来，美国黑人不断地进行了顽强的斗争，他们要自由，要解放。
    从血的历史教训中，从严酷的现实中，美国黑人逐渐明白了：向反动派乞求自由、解放，乞求平等权利，是与虎谋皮。只有拿起枪杆子，采用革命的暴力，才能击败美国统治集团的反革命暴力，夺取胜利。从一九五七年震动世界的阿肯色州小石城事件以来，美国黑人的斗争规模越来越大。特别是自从一九六三年八月八日我们伟大领袖毛主席发表《支持美国黑人反对美帝国主义种族歧视的正义斗争的声明》以来，美国黑人进一步觉醒，一次又一次地掀起了大规模抗暴斗争。他们拿起石块、棍棒、燃烧瓶和枪杆子，代替昔日的泪水、请愿和祈祷。纽约哈莱姆区的黑人燃起了愤怒的火焰。洛杉矶瓦茨区的黑人狙击手射出了复仇的子弹。在芝加哥、底特律、华盛顿……，熊熊的斗争烈火一次又一次地燃起。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席，代表七亿中国人民，对美国黑人的正义斗争表示坚决的支持。毛主席的声明，说出了七亿中国人民心里的话。我们热烈拥护，坚决执行！革命人民心连心。美国黑人的抗暴斗争，是全世界人民反对美帝国主义的总斗争的一个组成部分。
    美国黑人兄弟：我们中国人民誓作你们的后盾！
      “万恶的殖民主义、帝国主义制度是随着奴役和贩卖黑人而兴盛起来的，它也必将随着黑色人种的彻底解放而告终。”
    历史必将证明我们伟大领袖这一科学论断。
    美国黑人必胜！美帝国主义必败！
