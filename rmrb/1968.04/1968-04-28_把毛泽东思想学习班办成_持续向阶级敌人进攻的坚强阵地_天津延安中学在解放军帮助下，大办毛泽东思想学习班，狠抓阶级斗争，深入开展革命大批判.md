The revolutionary teachers and students of Tianjin Yan'an Middle School, with the assistance of the military training team, have taken class struggle as the key, intensively carried out revolutionary criticism, and turned the Mao Zedong Thought study classes into a stronghold for continuous attacks on class enemies.

The school's revolutionary teachers and students, along with the military training team, responded to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao and quickly established study classes. However, they were unsure about how to run the classes effectively and what to focus on. Chairman Mao said, "Holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes." However, why did the classes in this school initially fail to address various issues within the school? They studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Never forget class struggle." "Class struggle, once grasped, is effective." Chairman Mao also taught us that class struggle "must be emphasized year-round, month-round, and day-round." Reflecting on the journey of Yan'an Middle School, they said that over the past year, every step forward was made under the guidance of Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive, actively attacking class enemies. The initial failure of the study classes was due to not grasping the key of class struggle. They deeply felt that the problems arising in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are all issues of class struggle, two lines, and two roads. Chairman Mao's series of latest directives are the best weapons guiding us to victory in class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. Therefore, various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's series of latest directives, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasp the key of class struggle, carry out revolutionary criticism, and solve the problems arising in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Continuously launch attacks on the enemies of the proletariat.

In November of last year, during the political construction of the school assisted by the military training team and the revolutionary teachers and students, the capitalist roaders within the Party in Yan'an Middle School incited a small number of deceived masses to spread the idea that "political construction is rigid and mechanical," attempting to resist the emphasis on proletarian politics and the "four firsts." This capitalist roader has opposed Mao Zedong Thought and defamed the Communist Party in recent years. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, although he was exposed by the revolutionary teachers and students, he remained unrepentant and frequently spread rumors to deceive a small number of people, opposing Chairman Mao's "March 7" directive and the educational revolution of the school. Therefore, the military training team and the revolutionary committee, in addition to vigorously promoting the great significance of political construction throughout the school, also organized broad revolutionary teachers and students in various study classes to expose the evil plots of class enemies. This clarified everyone's eyes, heightened their class struggle awareness, foiled the enemy's sabotage plots, and successfully embarked on the path of political construction.

In December of last year, shortly after Yan'an Middle School decided to enroll new students, rumors spread within the school and society. The military training team and the revolutionary committee, upon analyzing the rumors, unanimously agreed that this was a sabotage by class enemies against the enrollment work. They educated the entire school's teachers and students not to fall for the class enemies' tricks and dispatched military training personnel and revolutionary teachers and students to nearby primary schools to hold study classes for graduating students. Through the study classes, the graduating students from several nearby primary schools received a profound class struggle education. This study class not only thoroughly exposed the class enemies' rumors but also ensured that the new students received class struggle education before enrollment.

Recently, the enemies of the proletariat in Yan'an Middle School incited a small number of deceived masses, attempting to rehabilitate the capitalist roaders within the Party in Yan'an Middle School and attack some members of the revolutionary committee. Upon discovering this trend, the broad revolutionary teachers and students took the initiative to counterattack. The revolutionary committee, teachers, and various grades and classes held various types of study classes focused on class struggle. The entire school's teachers and students, armed with Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, exposed the manifestations of class struggle within society and Yan'an Middle School, investigated the various sabotage activities of class enemies, and quickly exposed the ringleaders attempting to rehabilitate the capitalist roaders within the Party in Yan'an Middle School. This battle not only dealt a new heavy blow to the class enemies but also educated the entire school's revolutionary teachers and students. Everyone saw more clearly the ugly face of the capitalist roaders within the Party, and the revolutionary committee was tempered and strengthened in the class struggle. With Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism and revolution." The practice of Yan'an Middle School proves that on the battlefield of study classes, which continuously attack class enemies, to truly defeat class enemies and achieve comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it is necessary to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon and deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism.

Over the past few months, the revolutionary criticism in various study classes of Yan'an Middle School has been conducted around the struggle between the two educational lines. In December of last year, when enrolling new students, the military training team and the revolutionary committee, based on the previous intensive criticism of the revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev, followed Chairman Mao's teachings, formed a "three-in-one" enrollment group consisting of the revolutionary committee, revolutionary student representatives, and military training personnel, and went to five nearby primary schools to enroll students. They also held Mao Zedong Thought study classes with the graduating students of these five primary schools. In the study classes, the enrollment group and the students of each graduating class jointly conducted a great indictment, exposure, and criticism of the revisionist educational line pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev. This not only made the new students deeply hate the revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev before enrollment but also initially learned to use the weapon of great criticism to fight against class enemies. The teachers' study classes and students' study classes also, in conjunction with the educational revolution, continuously criticized the revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev, deepening their understanding of Chairman Mao's educational line in the great criticism, and achieving one victory after another in the educational revolution.

For a period, under the influence of anarchist trends in society, Yan'an Middle School also saw the emergence of anarchist trends, affecting the resumption of classes and the revolution. The military training team and the school revolutionary committee held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes throughout the school, focusing on overcoming anarchist trends.

Teachers and students linked the situation in society and the school, listed the crimes of anarchism, discussed the dangers of anarchism, and dug out the roots of anarchism, launching a "people's war" to criticize anarchism. Broad revolutionary teachers and students condemned and criticized, directing their firepower and hatred towards the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Tianjin and Yan'an Middle School. They said: The Chinese Khrushchev is the backer of anarchists; our struggle against anarchism is a serious struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads. Some teachers and students influenced by anarchist trends, through revolutionary criticism, raised their awareness and expressed their determination to overcome anarchist thoughts and strengthen proletarian organizational discipline.

In the continuous attacks on class enemies, it is also necessary to relentlessly fight against the "self" in one's mind. The practice of Yan'an Middle School proves: Mao Zedong Thought study classes, while continuously attacking class enemies, must also relentlessly fight against the "self" in one's mind. Only by defeating the "self" in one's mind can one better defeat class enemies.

In the study classes, intensively promoting the thought revolution of the revolutionary committee's leading members is an important link in carrying out the school's class struggle. For a period, due to the "self" in the minds of some members of the revolutionary committee, they had disagreements with each other and relaxed their struggle against the capitalist roaders within the Party. In the study classes, they exposed their selfish thoughts, fought against the "self," and realized: having "self" in the mind makes it easiest to be used by class enemies. They felt that due to the "self" in the mind, they relaxed the struggle against the enemy, affecting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of the school, and disappointing Chairman Mao's expectations in the great "March 7" directive. The more they fought against the "self," the closer they followed Chairman Mao; the deeper they fought against the "self," the more devoted they were to Chairman Mao. Broad revolutionary teachers and students in the study classes relentlessly fought against the "self" in their minds, united on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, and jointly fought against the enemy.

Over the past few months, Yan'an Middle School, with class struggle as the key and revolutionary criticism as the main form, has turned the Mao Zedong Thought study classes into a stronghold for continuous attacks on class enemies, tempering the broad revolutionary teachers and students, and also tempering all military training personnel. The more these Mao Zedong Thought study classes are held, the greater the achievements; the more they are held, the redder the hearts of the revolutionary teachers and students; the more they are held, the tighter they follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment; the more they are held, the more loyal they are to the great leader Chairman Mao. Broad revolutionary teachers and students take class struggle as the key, using the perspective of class struggle to view and analyze everything. A generation of red revolutionary successors, infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, is growing up in Yan'an Middle School.

    把毛泽东思想学习班办成  持续向阶级敌人进攻的坚强阵地
    天津延安中学在解放军帮助下，大办毛泽东思想学习班，狠抓阶级斗争，深入开展革命大批判
    新华社天津二十六日电　天津延安中学革命师生在军训团协助下，以阶级斗争为纲，狠抓革命大批判，把毛泽东思想学习班办成持续向阶级敌人进攻的坚强阵地。
    这个学校的革命师生和军训团的同志响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，很快就办起了学习班。但是，怎样办好学习班，突出什么重点，心中无数。毛主席说：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”可是这个学校办的学习班开始为什么对校内的各种问题解决得不好呢？他们带着这个问题学习了毛主席的教导：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争。”“阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”毛主席还教导我们，阶级斗争
  “必须年年讲，月月讲，天天讲”。他们在回顾延安中学走过的历程时说，一年来，我们每前进一步，都是在伟大领袖毛主席“三·七”指示的光辉照耀下，向阶级敌人主动进攻的结果。开始学习班没办好，就是没有抓住阶级斗争这个纲。他们说，我们深深体会到：无产阶级文化大革命中所出现的问题，都是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的问题。毛主席发出的一系列最新指示，都是指引我们在阶级斗争和两条路线斗争中夺取胜利的最好的武器。因此，各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，必须坚决贯彻落实毛主席一系列最新指示，紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，紧紧抓住阶级斗争这个纲，开展革命大批判，才能解决无产阶级文化大革命中出现的问题。持续不断地向无产阶级
  的敌人发动进攻
    去年十一月，在军训团协助校革委会和广大革命师生大搞政治建校的时候，延安中学党内走资派挑拨煽动少数受蒙蔽群众，散布什么“政治建校是生搬硬套”，妄图以此来抵制突出无产阶级政治和反对“四个第一”。这个走资派，近几年来，反对毛泽东思想，污蔑共产党。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他虽然被广大革命师生揪了出来，但他顽固不化，不时散布流言蜚语，蒙蔽少数群众反对毛主席的“三·七”指示和学校的教育革命。因此，军训团和革委会除在全校大张旗鼓宣传政治建校的伟大意义外，还在各个学习班上发动广大革命师生揭露阶级敌人的罪恶阴谋，从而擦亮了大家的眼睛，提高了大家的阶级斗争观念，粉碎了敌人的破坏阴谋，胜利地走上了政治建校的道路。
    去年十二月，延安中学刚刚做出招收新生的决定，学校里和社会上就传出了谣言。军训团和革委会在分析这个谣言时一致认为，这是阶级敌人破坏招生工作。于是他们一面教育全校师生不要上阶级敌人的当，一面派出军训人员和革命师生深入到附近小学去举办应届小学毕业生学习班。经过学习班的学习，附近几个小学的应届毕业生都受到了一次深刻的阶级斗争教育。这次学习班，不仅彻底戳穿了阶级敌人的谣言，而且使新生入学前就受到了阶级斗争的教育。
    不久前，延安中学无产阶级的敌人又挑动少数受蒙蔽群众，妄图为延安中学党内走资派翻案，攻击校革委会的一些成员。广大革命师生发现这个苗头后，主动进行了反击。校革委会、教师和各年级各教学班，都办起了以阶级斗争为专题的各种类型的学习班。全校师生以毛主席有关阶级和阶级斗争的教导为武器，大揭社会上和延安中学校内阶级斗争的表现，大查阶级敌人的各种阴谋破坏活动，很快揪出了妄图为延安中学党内走资派翻案的坏头头。这一仗，既给了阶级敌人以新的沉重打击，也教育了全校革命师生，大家对党内走资派的丑恶面目看得更清楚了，革委会也在阶级斗争中锻炼得更加巩固、更加坚强了。以毛泽东思想为武器，深入持久地开展革命大批判
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。延安中学的实践证明，在学习班这个持续向阶级敌人进攻的战场上，要真正战胜阶级敌人，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，就必须以毛泽东思想为武器，深入持久地开展革命大批判。
    几个月来，延安中学各学习班的革命大批判，是围绕两条教育路线的斗争进行的。去年十二月招收新生时，军训团和革委会在前一段狠批中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义教育路线的基础上，遵照毛主席的教导，由革委会、革命师生代表和军训人员组成“三结合”招生小组，深入到附近五个小学去招生，并同这五个小学应届毕业生一起举办毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班里，招生小组和各毕业班学生一起，对中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的修正主义教育路线展开了大控诉、大揭发和大批判。这样做，不仅使新生入学前就无比仇恨中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义教育路线，同时也初步学会了运用大批判这个武器同阶级敌人进行战斗的本领。教师学习班和学生学习班，也结合教育革命持续批判中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义教育路线，在大批判中加深对毛主席教育路线的理解，使教育革命取得了一个又一个胜利。
    有一个时期，在社会上无政府主义思潮的影响下，延安中学也出现了无政府主义思潮，影响了复课闹革命。军训团和校革委会就在全校办起了以克服无政府主义思潮为中心的各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。
    师生们联系社会上和学校的情况，大列无政府主义的罪状，大论无政府主义的危害，大挖无政府主义的根源，开展了一场批判无政府主义的“人民战争”。广大革命师生口诛笔伐，都把火力和仇恨集中到中国赫鲁晓夫和他在天津以及延安中学的代理人身上。大家说：中国赫鲁晓夫是无政府主义者的总后台；我们同无政府主义的斗争，是一场严肃的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争。有些受无政府主义思潮影响的师生，通过革命大批判，提高了认识，表示决心克服无政府主义思想，加强无产阶级的组织纪律性。
    在持续向阶级敌人进攻的同时，也要不停顿地狠斗自己头脑中的“私”字延安中学的实践证明：毛泽东思想学习班在持续向阶级敌人进攻的同时，也要不停地狠斗自己头脑中的“私”字。只有战胜头脑中“私”字这个敌人，才能更好地战胜阶级敌人。
    在学习班里，狠抓革委会领导成员的思想革命化，是搞好学校阶级斗争的重要一环。有一段时间，革委会部分成员之间由于头脑里的“私”字作怪，彼此有意见，放松了对党内走资派的斗争。在学习班里，他们各自亮私心，斗“私”字，认识到：头脑里有“私”字，最容易被阶级敌人利用。他们感到，由于头脑里有“私”字，放松了对敌斗争，以致影响了学校的无产阶级文化大革命，辜负了毛主席在伟大的“三·七”指示中对自己的希望。斗私越狠，跟毛主席越紧，斗私越深，对毛主席越亲。广大革命师生在学习班里狠斗自己的“私”字，在毛泽东思想的原则基础上团结起来，共同对敌。
    几个月来，延安中学以阶级斗争为纲，以革命大批判为主要形式，把毛泽东思想学习班办成持续向阶级敌人进攻的坚强阵地，锻炼了广大革命师生，也锻炼了全体军训人员。这种毛泽东思想学习班，越办战果越大；越办革命师生的心越红；越办，对毛主席的伟大战略部署跟得越紧；越办，对伟大领袖毛主席越忠。广大革命师生以阶级斗争为纲，用阶级斗争观点看待一切，分析一切。一代无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的红色革命接班人正在延安中学成长起来。
