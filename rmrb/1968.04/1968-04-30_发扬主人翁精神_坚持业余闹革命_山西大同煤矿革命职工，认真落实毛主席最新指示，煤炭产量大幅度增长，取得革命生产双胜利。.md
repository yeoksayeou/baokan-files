The revolutionary workers of the Datong Coal Mine in Shanxi Province have earnestly implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, resulting in a significant increase in coal production and achieving double victories in revolution and production.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Taoyuan, April 29: Under the assistance of the People's Liberation Army, the Datong Coal Mine Revolutionary Committee has led the broad revolutionary workers to take class struggle as the key link, earnestly implement the series of latest instructions by the great leader Chairman Mao, and achieve victories in both revolution and production. Since entering April, coal production has been thriving. From April 1 to 27, coal production has significantly increased compared to the same period in March, and the excavation length has increased by 11%.

After the establishment of the Datong Coal Mine Revolutionary Committee, the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed here to support the left have, in accordance with the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, "Never forget class struggle," helped the committee members to take class struggle as the key link and earnestly implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions such as "Grasp revolution, promote production." The committee members and the masses together exposed the series of evil plots of the enemies of the proletarian revolution who incited anarchism, sabotaged the revolution and production, and attempted to overthrow the newly born revolutionary committee.

While launching an offensive against the enemies of the proletarian revolution, the broad revolutionary masses studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Discipline is the guarantee for implementing the line. Without discipline, the Party cannot lead the masses and the army to fight a victorious battle." They said: We must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, support the work of the revolutionary committee, obey the leadership of the revolutionary committee, and maintain the authority of the revolutionary committee. They carried forward the high sense of responsibility as masters, firmly guarded their production posts, observed labor discipline, insisted on the eight-hour workday, and persisted in revolutionizing in their spare time. The spirit of communism that puts the public first is greatly carried forward throughout the mine, and good deeds and high-yield, over-fulfillment wells and mining teams appear one after another. The situation in the entire mine is excellent.

    发扬主人翁精神　坚持业余闹革命
    山西大同煤矿革命职工，认真落实毛主席最新指示，煤炭产量大幅度增长，取得革命生产双胜利。
    据新华社太原二十九日电　山西大同煤矿革命委员会在人民解放军的帮助下，带领广大革命职工，以阶级斗争为纲，认真落实伟大领袖毛主席的一系列最新指示，夺取了革命和生产双胜利。进入四月份以来，煤炭生产蒸蒸日上。四月一日到二十七日，煤炭产量比三月同期有大幅度增长，掘进进尺提高百分之十一。
    大同煤矿革命委员会成立后，在这里担负支左任务的人民解放军指战员，遵照伟大领袖毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，帮助革委会成员，以阶级斗争为纲，认真落实毛主席“抓革命，促生产”等一系列最新指示。革委会的成员和群众一起，揭穿了无产阶级革命的敌人煽动无政府主义，破坏抓革命促生产，妄图颠覆新生的革命委员会的一系列罪恶阴谋。
    在向无产阶级革命的敌人发动进攻的同时，广大革命群众学习了毛主席的教导：“纪律是执行路线的保证，没有纪律，党就无法率领群众与军队进行胜利的斗争。”他们说：我们要坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，支持革委会的工作，服从革委会的领导，维护革委会的权威。他们发扬主人翁的高度责任感，坚守生产岗位，遵守劳动纪律，坚持八小时工作制，坚持业余闹革命，节约闹革命。一心为公的共产主义精神在全矿大大发扬，好人好事层出不穷，高产、超产的井口和采煤队接连出现。全矿形势一派大好。
