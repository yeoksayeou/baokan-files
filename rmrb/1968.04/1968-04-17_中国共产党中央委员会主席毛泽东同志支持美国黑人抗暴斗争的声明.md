Recently, the American black pastor Martin Luther King was suddenly assassinated by American imperialists. Martin Luther King was a proponent of non-violence, but the American imperialists did not show him any mercy. Instead, they used counter-revolutionary violence to carry out a bloody suppression against him. This incident deeply taught the broad masses of black people in America, sparking a new storm of struggle against violence, sweeping across more than a hundred cities in the United States, an unprecedented event in American history. It shows that among the more than twenty million black people in America, there lies an extremely powerful revolutionary force.

This storm of black people's struggle occurred within the United States, and is a prominent manifestation of the current political and economic crises facing American imperialism. It has dealt a heavy blow to American imperialism, which is already beset with internal and external difficulties.

The struggle of American black people is not only a struggle for freedom and liberation by the oppressed and exploited black people, but also a new call to arms for the entire oppressed and exploited American people against the brutal rule of the monopoly capitalist class. It is a great support and encouragement to the people of the world in their struggle against American imperialism, and to the Vietnamese people in their struggle against American imperialism. On behalf of the Chinese people, I express firm support for the just struggle of American black people.

American racial discrimination is a product of colonialism and imperialism. The contradiction between the broad masses of black people in America and the American ruling class is a class contradiction. Only by overthrowing the reactionary rule of the American monopoly capitalist class and destroying the colonialist and imperialist system can American black people achieve thorough liberation. The broad masses of black people in America and the broad laboring people among the white population in America have common interests and common goals in their struggle. Therefore, the struggle of American black people is gaining more and more sympathy and support from the laboring people and progressive individuals among the white population in America. The struggle of American black people will inevitably combine with the American workers' movement, ultimately putting an end to the evil rule of the American monopoly capitalist class.

In 1963, in my statement "In Support of the American Black People's Just Struggle Against American Imperialism's Racial Discrimination," I said: "The evil system of colonialism and imperialism, which has flourished with the enslavement and trafficking of black people, will also come to an end with the thorough liberation of the black race." I still hold this view today.

At present, the world revolution has entered a great new era. The struggle of American black people for liberation is a part of the overall struggle of the people of the world against American imperialism, and a part of the contemporary world revolution. I call upon: the workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and all those who are willing to oppose American imperialism in various countries of the world, to take action, and give strong support to the struggle of American black people! Let the people of the world unite more closely, and launch a sustained and fierce attack on our common enemy, American imperialism, and its running dogs! It can be affirmed that the thorough collapse of colonialism, imperialism, and all exploitative systems, and the thorough liberation of all oppressed peoples and nations, is not far off.

    中国共产党中央委员会主席毛泽东同志支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明
    （一九六八年四月十六日）
     最近，美国黑人牧师马丁·路德·金突然被美帝国主义者暗杀。马丁·路德·金是一个非暴力主义者，但美帝国主义者并没有因此对他宽容，而是使用反革命的暴力，对他进行血腥的镇压。这一件事，深刻地教训了美国的广大黑人群众，激起了他们抗暴斗争的新风暴，席卷了美国一百几十个城市，是美国历史上前所未有的。它显示了在两千多万美国黑人中，蕴藏着极其强大的革命力量。
    这场黑人的斗争风暴发生在美国国内，是美帝国主义当前整个政治危机和经济危机的一个突出表现。它给陷于内外交困的美帝国主义以沉重的打击。
    美国黑人的斗争，不仅是被剥削、被压迫的黑人争取自由解放的斗争，而且是整个被剥削、被压迫的美国人民反对垄断资产阶级残暴统治的新号角。它对于全世界人民反对美帝国主义的斗争，对于越南人民反对美帝国主义的斗争，是一个巨大的支援和鼓舞。我代表中国人民，对美国黑人的正义斗争，表示坚决的支持。
    美国的种族歧视，是殖民主义、帝国主义制度的产物。美国广大黑人同美国统治集团之间的矛盾，是阶级矛盾。只有推翻美国垄断资产阶级的反动统治，摧毁殖民主义、帝国主义制度，美国黑人才能够取得彻底解放。美国广大黑人同美国白人中的广大劳动人民，有着共同的利益和共同的斗争目标。因此，美国黑人的斗争正在获得越来越多的美国白色人种中的劳动人民和进步人士的同情和支持。美国黑人斗争必将同美国工人运动相结合，最终结束美国垄断资产阶级的罪恶统治。
    我在一九六三年《支持美国黑人反对美帝国主义种族歧视的正义斗争的声明》中说过：“万恶的殖民主义、帝国主义制度是随着奴役和贩卖黑人而兴盛起来的，它也必将随着黑色人种的彻底解放而告终。”我现在仍然坚持这个观点。
    当前，世界革命进入了一个伟大的新时代。美国黑人争取解放的斗争，是全世界人民反对美帝国主义的总斗争的一个组成部分，是当代世界革命的一个组成部分。我呼吁：世界各国的工人、农民、革命知识分子和一切愿意反对美帝国主义的人们，行动起来，给予美国黑人的斗争以强大的声援！全世界人民更紧密地团结起来，向着我们的共同敌人美帝国主义及其帮凶们发动持久的猛烈的进攻！可以肯定，殖民主义、帝国主义和一切剥削制度的彻底崩溃，世界上一切被压迫人民、被压迫民族的彻底翻身，已经为期不远了。
