Congolese (Brazzaville) friends cheered Mao Zedong's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence, saying that Chairman Mao's statement has shown the oppressed people the road to victory.

At a seminar held in Brazzaville, Congolese (Brazzaville) friend Orentsonpa said, "We highly appreciate Chairman Mao's statement because it is a great encouragement to the people of all countries who are fighting and points out the correct path they must follow to achieve victory."

Another friend, Jean Jacques, pointed out that Chairman Mao's statement has profound guiding significance for the just struggle of American blacks and all oppressed people against oppression, exploitation, and for liberation. He said that this statement has made new contributions to the revolutionary theory of Marxism-Leninism.

This friend emphasized, "The revolutionary people of all countries, by studying and applying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, will certainly achieve final victory."

A friend named Emile quoted Chairman Mao's teachings, saying, "The oppressed people and oppressed nations can never pin their hopes for liberation on the 'wisdom' of imperialism and its lackeys, but can only achieve victory through strengthening unity and persisting in struggle."

He said that the fact that Martin Luther King was murdered should make those who advocate so-called non-violent struggle realize that the oppressed and exploited people, including American blacks, can only gain liberation through violent struggle.

A friend named Bougu said that the revolutionary people of all countries must remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "The enemy will not disappear by itself," and "Anything reactionary is bound to perish."

He said that Johnson will not turn into an angel. Non-violentism will never be able to defeat the brutal enemy, American imperialism.

A friend named Berna said that the great teacher Chairman Mao's statement has given valuable guidance to the people of all countries who are fighting. Revolutionary people and laborers must take up arms to fight for liberation.

The Congolese (Brazzaville) friends who participated in the seminar also expressed, "The revolutionary people of all countries must consciously apply the thought of the great contemporary Marxist-Leninist Mao Zedong. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought will lead us to final victory. American imperialism and the reactionaries of all countries will surely be completely destroyed."

They also pointed out that the people of the world should respond to the call of the great teacher Chairman Mao, unite more closely, and launch a sustained and fierce attack on the common enemy, American imperialism, and its accomplices.

These Congolese (Brazzaville) friends, with deep feelings for Chairman Mao, wished Chairman Mao eternal life!

    刚果（布）朋友欢呼毛主席声明给各国人民巨大鼓舞
    活学活用马列主义、毛泽东思想
    革命人民就定能取得最后胜利
    新华社布拉柴维尔二十四日电　刚果（布）朋友在热烈欢呼毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明的时候说，毛主席的声明给被压迫人民指明了胜利的道路。
    在布拉柴维尔举行的一次座谈会上，刚果（布）朋友奥恩特松帕说：“我们高度评价毛主席的声明，因为它是对斗争中的各国人民的巨大鼓舞，并且向他们指明了取得胜利所必须遵循的正确道路。”
    另一位朋友让·雅克指出：毛主席的声明对美国黑人和一切被压迫人民反对压迫、剥削和争取解放的正义斗争，具有深远的指导意义。他说，这个声明，对马克思列宁主义的革命理论作出了新的贡献。
    这位朋友强调指出：“各国革命人民活学活用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，就一定能取得最后胜利。”
    一位名叫埃米尔的朋友援引毛主席的教导说：“被压迫人民和被压迫民族，决不能把自己的解放寄托在帝国主义及其走狗的‘明智’上面，而只有通过加强团结、坚持斗争，才能取得胜利。”
    他说，马丁·路德·金被杀害的事实，应该使那些主张所谓非暴力斗争的人们懂得，包括美国黑人在内的各国被压迫、被剥削的人民，只有通过暴力斗争才能获得解放。
    一名叫布古的朋友指出，各国革命人民必须牢记毛主席的教导：“敌人是不会自行消灭的”，“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。”
    他说，约翰逊不会变成天使。非暴力主义永远不能打倒美帝国主义这个残暴的敌人。
    一位名叫伯纳的朋友说，伟大导师毛主席的声明，给了正在进行斗争的各国人民宝贵的教导。革命人民和劳动群众必须拿起枪来进行斗争，才能得到解放。
    参加座谈会的刚果（布）朋友们还表示：“世界各国革命人民必须自觉地运用当代伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东主席的思想。战无不胜的毛泽东思想将引导我们取得最后胜利。美帝国主义和各国反动派定将统统被消灭。”
    他们还指出，全世界人民响应伟大导师毛主席的号召，要更紧密地团结起来，向着共同敌人美帝国主义及其帮凶们发动持久的猛烈的进攻。
    这些刚果（布）朋友怀着对毛主席的深厚感情，祝毛主席万寿无疆！
