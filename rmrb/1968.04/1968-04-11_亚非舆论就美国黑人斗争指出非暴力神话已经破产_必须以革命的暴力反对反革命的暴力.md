The Asian and African public opinions on the American Black struggle have pointed out that the myth of non-violence has collapsed. It is necessary to use revolutionary violence to counter revolutionary violence.

The oppressed peoples cannot place their hopes on the "wisdom" and "goodwill" of the reactionaries of various countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Khen, April 10th - The Pathet Lao Radio Station on the 10th issued a commentary stating that the Lao people firmly support the just and courageous struggle of American blacks against racial discrimination and for freedom and equal rights. They also see this struggle as a powerful support for the Lao people's anti-American national salvation cause.

The commentary pointed out that the Lao people are firmly convinced that the American black masses will further carry forward the tradition of courageous struggle, together with all the people of the United States, to strengthen the struggle against the common enemy, American imperialism, and achieve final victory.

Xinhua News Agency, April 10th - Iraqi and Malian publications have expressed support for the rapidly developing American black anti-violence struggle and pointed out that oppressed nations and peoples must use revolutionary violence to counter revolutionary violence.

The Iraqi "People's Daily" on the 7th published a commentary stating that American blacks are using force to counter violent suppression, shaking the foundation of Washington's rule and causing fear among American rulers. The commentary pointed out that American imperialism, in order to finance its military aggression against other countries, imposes taxes and heavy burdens on the middle class and the poor, including blacks. American imperialism's policy of aggression will inevitably lead to its collapse.

The same newspaper published an article on the same day discussing the assassination of American black pastor Martin Luther King by white racists. The article pointed out that Martin Luther King wanted non-violent peace, but violence killed him. He wanted to use speeches to gain his rights, but he was killed by bullets.

The article pointed out that American blacks must use violence to counter violence.

The recent issue of Mali's "Development" weekly commented: "The death of Reverend Martin Luther King means the collapse of the myth of solving problems through non-violent means for many people."

The commentary emphasized that the nature of imperialism will never change. In the face of capitalist and racist exploitation policies, the oppressed must either use organized violence to counter the reactionary violence of their enemies or, conversely, not resist violently and suffer violence.

The commentary continued, "History has proven that in this world, the oppressed and exploited, if they place their hopes on the 'awakening,' 'wisdom,' or 'goodwill' of the reactionaries of various countries, it is in vain."

The commentary concluded, "As long as the 22 million black brothers in the United States have the courage, unite, strengthen their ranks, dare to struggle, fear no difficulties, and fight to the end, then victory will surely be theirs."

The violent actions of angry American black masses have turned many high-rise buildings of white racists in Chicago into ruins, frightening the American ruling class to the point of losing their souls.

The situation of the American black anti-violence struggle is depicted in the following map.

A massive wave of American black anti-violence struggle has swept across the United States with unprecedented speed. In just a few days, the flames of anti-violence struggle have spread from south to north and from east to west, engulfing more than a hundred cities of various sizes in the United States, fully demonstrating the unprecedented awakening of American blacks.

The following map shows some of the main cities where American blacks are fighting against violence.

    亚非舆论就美国黑人斗争指出非暴力神话已经破产
    必须以革命的暴力反对反革命的暴力
    被压迫人民不能把希望寄托在各国反动派的“明智”和“善良意愿”上
    新华社康开十日电 巴特寮电台十日发表评论说，老挝人民坚决支持美国黑人为反对种族歧视、争取自由与平等权利而进行的正义和英勇的斗争，并且把这一斗争看作是对老挝人民的抗美救国事业的有力的支持。
    评论指出，老挝人民坚信，美国黑人群众将大力发扬英勇斗争的传统，同美国全体人民一起，进一步加强反对共同敌人美帝国主义的斗争，取得最后胜利。
    新华社十日讯　伊拉克和马里报刊表示支持迅猛发展的美国黑人抗暴斗争，并且指出，被压迫民族和人民必须以革命的暴力来反对反革命的暴力。
    伊拉克《人民报》七日发表评论说，美国黑人以武力反对暴力镇压，动摇着华盛顿统治的基础，使美国统治者感到恐惧。评论指出，美帝国主义为了搜括对别国进行军事侵略的费用，把税收和沉重的负担强加给中等阶层和贫困的阶层，包括黑人在内。美帝国主义的侵略政策必将导致它的崩溃。
    这家报纸同一天刊载的一篇文章里谈到了美国黑人牧师马丁·路德·金被白人种族主义者暗杀的事件。文章指出，马丁·路德·金要非暴力的和平，但是暴力杀害了他。他要用发表讲演的办法来取得自己的权利，但是被人家用枪弹打死了。
    文章指出，美国黑人必须用暴力来对付暴力。
    马里《发展》周刊最近一期的社论说：“马丁·路德·金牧师之死，对于许多人来说，意味着用非暴力的手段解决问题的神话的破产。”
    社论强调指出，帝国主义的本性是永远不会改变的。在资本主义和种族主义的剥削政策面前，受压迫者要么以有组织的暴力来对付自己的敌人的反动的暴力；要么就相反，不作暴力的反抗而承受暴力。
    社论接着说，“历史已经证明，在这个世界上，被压迫者和被剥削者，如果把希望寄托在各国反动派的‘觉悟’、‘明智’或‘善良意愿’上，那是徒劳的。”
    社论最后说，两千二百万美国黑人兄弟只要有勇气，团结起来，巩固自己的队伍，敢于斗争，不怕困难，前赴后继，那么胜利一定是属于他们的。（附图片）
