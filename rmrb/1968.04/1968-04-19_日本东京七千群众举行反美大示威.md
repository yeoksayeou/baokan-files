	Tokyo, Japan: Approximately 7,000 patriotic workers, students, and citizens held a massive rally and demonstration in Tokyo on April 15, strongly opposing the construction of a new field hospital by the U.S. military in Tokyo.

	In the evening of April 15, about 3,000 workers and students gathered in Minamiyosen Park in the northern district of Tokyo to hold a protest rally. The participants continuously chanted slogans such as: "Yankees go home!" "Down with the Sato government!" "Long live the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people!" "Long live the struggle of the American blacks!" "Long live the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Japan!"

	After the rally, the participants marched in a demonstration. The procession, carrying red flags with the words "Long live Mao Zedong Thought," marched towards the main gate of the U.S. military camp. Along the way, citizens cheered and joined the procession, increasing its size.

	The Japanese armed police, at the behest of the U.S. military, set up barbed wire at the main gate of the camp and deployed armored vehicles, water cannons, and a large number of armed police to suppress the demonstrators.

	The demonstrators, undeterred by the police's suppression, pushed aside the barbed wire and held a protest rally there. The nearby hills and many rooftops were filled with people supporting the rally.

	The rally participants were brutally suppressed by the reactionary police, but they fearlessly fought back with sticks and stones.

	In addition, another group of about 150 students attacked the police station in front of Prince Station, smashing the station's building.

	Furthermore, about 2,000 students and citizens surrounded the "unity house" built by the revisionist group of the Japan Communist Party in a residential area far from the U.S. military camp. They exposed the hypocrisy of these revisionists, who pretended to oppose the field hospital but were actually collaborating with the enemy. The crowd tore down the fake sign that read "Oppose the Field Hospital" and denounced the revisionists as "cowardly legalists," shouting, "Get out, revisionists who dare not fight against U.S. imperialism!" The revisionists were left in a state of disarray.

    日本东京七千群众举行反美大示威
    游行队伍高举写有“毛泽东思想万岁”的红旗英勇前进
    示威群众高呼“越南人民的英勇斗争万岁！”“美国黑人斗争前进万岁！”
    新华社十六日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本东京的爱国工人、学生、市民约七千人，十五日举行声势浩大的集会和示威游行，强烈反对驻日美军在东京新建野战医院。
    十五日晚间，约三千名工人和学生在东京北区南谷端公园举行抗议集会。参加集会的人们不断高呼：“美国佬滚出去！”
  “打倒佐藤政府！”“越南人民的英勇斗争万岁！”“美国黑人斗争前进万岁！”“日中两国人民的战斗友谊万岁！”
    会后，与会者举行示威游行。游行队伍高举写有“毛泽东思想万岁”字样的红旗，向美国兵营正门进发。沿途，市民们鼓掌欢迎游行队伍，并踊跃加入游行行列，使这支队伍的人数倍增。
    日本武装警察当局在美国兵营正门附近架设铁丝网，在正门入口处部署装甲车、喷水车和大批武装警察，镇压示威群众。
    示威群众不顾反动警察的镇压，推开了铁丝网，在那里举行抗议集会。集会场所附近的土岗上和许多屋顶上，都站满了声援抗议集会的人群。
    集会群众遭到了反动警察的镇压，但是他们不畏强暴，用棍棒和石块勇敢地反击武装警察。
    此外，另一支学生队伍约一百五十人，袭击了王子车站前的警察派出所，砸烂了派出所的房子。
    另外还有两千名学生和市民，包围了日共宫本修正主义集团在离美国兵营很远的居民住宅中间盖的“团结小屋”，揭露了他们假反美真投降的丑恶嘴脸，扯下了他们挂在“团结小屋”上的“反对野战医院”的假招牌。群众痛斥日共修正主义分子是“合法主义的胆小鬼”，高呼“不敢同美帝斗争的修正主义者滚蛋”，使修正主义分子狼狈不堪。（附图片）
