The Revolutionary Committee of Jiangxi Metalworks, through organizing Mao Zedong Thought study classes, has promoted the revolution and production of the entire factory.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, April 15th: The Revolutionary Committee of Jiangxi Metalworks, through organizing large-scale Mao Zedong Thought study classes, has led the masses to study Chairman Mao's statements on class struggle, strengthening the masses' awareness of class struggle. At the same time, they have extensively carried out "three reminiscences, three comparisons, and three examinations" activities, which include: reminiscing about the sufferings of exploitation and oppression in the old society, comparing the sweetness of Chairman Mao's wise leadership in the new society, and examining the sabotage activities of class enemies; reminiscing about the persecution by the reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev, comparing the sweetness of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and examining the poisonous influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionism spread by Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the party; reminiscing about the party and Chairman Mao's cultivation, comparing one's contributions to the party and the people, and examining the criticism and struggle against Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the party and a small number of class enemies. Through these activities, the masses' awareness of class struggle and line struggle has been heightened. Everyone has seen that class enemies are still attacking the proletariat in new forms. Everyone says: We must never forget class struggle, and we must never forget the revolutionary criticism of the handful of capitalist roaders within the party.

On the basis of significantly heightened awareness of class struggle and line struggle, all revolutionary workers in the factory have set up a battlefield for revolutionary criticism. With the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, they have exposed and criticized the heinous crimes of Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the party and their agents in their attempt to restore capitalism, thoroughly purging their poisonous influence. They have combined the actual struggles of the factory, the central tasks of each stage, and the living thoughts of the masses, concentrating their firepower to carry out thematic criticisms. Each time a task is carried out, they criticize one of the reactionary fallacies of Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the party. The vigorous revolutionary criticism has made Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the party completely sink into the vast sea of "people's war," becoming "rats crossing the street" that everyone wants to beat.

The Revolutionary Committee of Jiangxi Metalworks, closely combining revolutionary criticism, has timely analyzed and grasped the trends of class struggle in the factory, leading the broad revolutionary workers to smash the plots and tricks of a small handful of class enemies in the factory who attempted to sabotage the Revolutionary Committee and restore capitalism, as well as their evil deeds of sabotaging the revolution and production. The Revolutionary Committee, following Chairman Mao's teaching that "all reactionary forces that are about to perish will make their last struggles against the revolutionary forces," has educated the broad revolutionary workers to keep their eyes open and maintain high revolutionary vigilance. The members of the Revolutionary Committee and the worker masses together, using the perspective of class struggle to observe, analyze, and deal with all problems, have seriously exposed the sabotage activities of class enemies. For example, when solving the problem of cadres, the broad revolutionary masses actively supported and enthusiastically helped the leading cadres who made mistakes to stand up for the revolution. A small handful of class enemies, however, stirred up evil winds and lit evil fires, creating a counter-revolutionary public opinion and doing everything possible to sabotage. The members of the Revolutionary Committee then went deep into the workshops and teams, leading the masses to repeatedly study and understand Chairman Mao's latest instructions, guiding everyone to use the class perspective for analysis, and timely exposing the evil plots of class enemies to sabotage the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

At present, the revolutionary and production situation in the factory is excellent. The broad revolutionary workers consciously strengthen their revolutionary spirit, scientific spirit, and organizational discipline. The revolutionary order in the factory is in good shape, and production is booming. The revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination are more solidified. Following the completion of the annual national production plan ahead of schedule last year, the factory has once again exceeded the production tasks for the first quarter of this year month by month.

    开展回忆对比活动，加强阶级斗争观念
    江西五金厂革委会通过举办毛泽东思想学习班，推动了全厂的革命和生产
    据新华社南昌十五日电　江西五金厂革委会通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，组织群众学习毛主席关于阶级斗争的论述，加强群众的阶级斗争观念；同时，广泛开展“三忆、三比、三查”活动，即：忆在旧社会受剥削受压迫的苦，比新社会毛主席英明领导的甜，查阶级敌人的破坏活动；忆中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线对自己的迫害，比毛主席无产阶级革命路线的甜，查中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派所散布的反革命修正主义的流毒；忆党和毛主席对自己的培养，比自己对党和人民的贡献，查对中国赫鲁晓夫等党内走资派和一小撮阶级敌人的批判斗争。通过这些活动，提高了群众的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟。大家看到了阶级敌人还在以新的形式向无产阶级进攻。大家说：我们千万不能忘记阶级斗争，千万不能忘记对党内一小撮走资派的革命大批判。
    在阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟大大提高的基础上，全厂革命职工摆开了革命大批判的战场，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，大揭大批中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派及其代理人妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行，彻底肃清其流毒。他们结合本厂的斗争实际、各个阶段的中心任务和群众中的活思想，集中火力，进行了专题批判。每进行一项工作，就批判中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派的一个反动谬论。轰轰烈烈的革命大批判，使中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派，完全陷入了“人民战争”的汪洋大海，成为人人喊打的“过街老鼠”。
    江西五金厂革委会紧密结合革命大批判，及时分析和掌握本厂阶级斗争的动向，率领广大革命职工粉碎了本厂一小撮阶级敌人妄图搞垮革委会、复辟资本主义的阴谋诡计和破坏革命、生产的罪恶勾当。革委会遵循毛主席“凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”教导，教育广大革命职工擦亮眼睛，把革命警惕性提得高高的。革委会成员和职工群众一起，用阶级斗争观点观察、分析、对待一切问题，认真揭发阶级敌人的阴谋破坏活动。例如解决干部问题时，广大革命群众积极支持和热情帮助犯错误的领导干部站出来革命，一小撮阶级敌人却煽阴风，点邪火，大造反革命舆论，千方百计进行破坏。革委会成员便深入车间、班组，带领群众反复学习、领会毛主席的最新指示，引导大家用阶级观点进行分析，及时揭穿了阶级敌人妄图破坏落实毛主席最新指示的罪恶阴谋。
    目前，这个厂革命和生产形势一片大好。广大革命职工自觉地加强革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，厂内革命秩序井然，生产热气腾腾。革命大联合和革命三结合更加巩固。全厂继去年提前完成全年国家生产计划之后，今年第一季度又月月超额完成生产任务。
