Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out with piercing insight: "To pay lip service while acting to the contrary, to say one thing and mean another, to speak sweetly to one's face while stabbing in the back—these are the manifestations of two-faced behavior." The counter-revolutionary revisionist, anti-party and anti-military conspirator Luo Ruiqing is precisely such a typical counter-revolutionary two-faced traitor who says one thing and does another, who has one face in public and another in private.

This scoundrel, who wants to engage in counter-revolutionary activities but fears exposure, has gone to great lengths to disguise himself as a revolutionary. He relies on political opportunism to make a living, seizing and exploiting whatever is beneficial to him, and pushing away and opposing whatever is not. He appears to be human on the surface, but is a devil at heart; he speaks like a human, but acts like a devil.

This anti-party and anti-military conspirator, on the surface, pretends to support Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, but in reality, he opposes Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin. When Vice Chairman Lin issued a series of directives emphasizing the primacy of politics, Luo Ruiqing pretended to "support," "implement," and "execute" them. In reality, however, he used conciliatory tactics to oppose them, saying things like "politics and military affairs are equally important" and "military affairs and politics are of equal importance," thus contradicting Vice Chairman Lin's directives on emphasizing politics. Not only that, but he also arbitrarily decided to hold military competitions across the entire army, disrupting the mass movement to study Chairman Mao's works and undermining the political construction of our army.

For a long time, the anti-party and anti-military conspirator Luo Ruiqing has relied on his counter-revolutionary experience and political instincts to constantly observe the situation, shift with the wind, and play the role of a bourgeois politician, using counter-revolutionary two-faced tactics to gain political capital for himself. As early as the Anti-Japanese War period, he closely followed the anti-party conspirator and schemer Peng Dehuai. Later, during the Rectification Campaign in Yan'an, he saw that Peng Dehuai was being criticized and hypocritically turned around to criticize a few sentences. During the War of Liberation, he saw that Peng Dehuai was once again holding an important position, so he colluded with Peng Dehuai again, and shamelessly pleaded for Peng Dehuai, saying, "I also feel that the criticism of you was too harsh." In 1959, after Peng Dehuai's position was removed at the Lushan Conference and his anti-party and anti-military conspiracy was smashed, Luo Ruiqing quickly pretended to be anti-Peng Dehuai to get by and gain political capital.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Counter-revolutionaries who appear in disguise give people a false impression while hiding their true nature. However, since they are counter-revolutionaries, they cannot completely hide their true nature."

Revolutionary fighters armed with Mao Zedong Thought have the reddest hearts and the keenest eyes. No matter how many times the class enemy transforms—whether it's 36 times or 72 times—they cannot escape the eyes of revolutionary fighters armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Luo Ruiqing, this counter-revolutionary two-faced traitor, has finally been exposed and has become a pile of filth despised by all. Moreover, the weeds have been turned into fertilizer. In the struggle against Luo Ruiqing and his ilk, the counter-revolutionary two-faced traitors, people have greatly enhanced their ability to combat such two-faced traitors.

    打倒反革命两面派
    解放军某部　跋山　任卫东
    我们伟大领袖毛主席曾经一针见血地指出：“阳奉阴违，口是心非，当面说得好听，背后又在捣鬼，这就是两面派行为的表现。”反革命修正主义分子、反党篡军大野心家罗瑞卿就是这样一个口是心非的，阴一套阳一套的典型的反革命两面派。
    这个家伙要干反革命又怕暴露自己，就煞费苦心地把自己打扮成革命的样子。他靠搞政治投机吃饭，凡是对他有利的就抓、就钻，对他不利的就推、就反。他表面是人，暗里是鬼；说的是人话，做的是鬼事。
    这个反党篡军的大野心家，表面上装作拥护毛主席，拥护林副主席的样子，暗地里却反对毛主席和林副主席。林副主席提出关于突出政治的一系列指示，他都装作“拥护”“贯彻”“执行”的样子，实际上却用折中主义的手法进行反对，说什么“政治军事是半斤八两”啊，什么“军事政治都是同等重要”啊，同林副主席关于突出政治的指示唱对台戏。不但如此，他还擅自决定全军大比武，破坏学习毛主席著作的群众运动，破坏我军的政治建设。
    长期以来，反党篡军大野心家罗瑞卿，就是凭着他的反革命经验和反革命政治嗅觉，时刻察颜观色地摸气候，见风使舵，大耍资产阶级政客的反革命两面手法，为自己捞取政治资本。早在抗日战争时期，他就紧跟反党大野心家、大阴谋家彭德怀。后来，在延安整风时，他看到彭德怀受到批判，也假惺惺地转过头来批评几句。到了解放战争时期，他见彭德怀又担任重要职务，便又和彭德怀勾结起来，并且无耻地为彭德怀鸣冤叫屈，说什么“我也觉得对你的批评过火了。”一九五九年庐山会议罢了彭德怀的官，粉碎了他反党篡军的阴谋以后，罗瑞卿又赶紧装作反彭德怀的样子，蒙混过关，捞取政治资本。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“以伪装出现的反革命分子，他们给人以假象，而将真象荫蔽着。但是他们既要反革命，就不可能将其真象荫蔽得十分彻底。”
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士，心最红，眼最亮，阶级敌人三十六变也好，七十二变也好，总是逃脱不了用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士的眼睛。罗瑞卿这个反革命两面派，终于被揪了出来，成了不齿于人类的狗屎堆。而且，毒草变成了肥料，人们在同罗瑞卿之流的反革命两面派斗争中，大大提高了同这种两面派作斗争的能力。
