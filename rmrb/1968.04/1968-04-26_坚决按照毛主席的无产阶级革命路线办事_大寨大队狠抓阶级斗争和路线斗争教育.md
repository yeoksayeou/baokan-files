The Party Branch of Dazhai Brigade, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, uses the class struggle and the struggle between the two lines in Dazhai since its liberation as teaching materials, leading the masses to conduct Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and conducting class struggle and line struggle education among cadres and community members. Through reminiscing, comparing, and summarizing, cadres and community members have a clearer understanding that the emergence and growth of socialist new Dazhai is the result of holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and strictly adhering to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. It is the result of using great Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fight against the bourgeois reactionary line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev, to fight against all class enemies, and to fight against bourgeois ideology and capitalist evil winds. In order for Dazhai to continue to improve, develop, and advance, it must closely follow the great helmsman Chairman Mao, better learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, and more resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. It must follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forgetting class struggle" and firmly grasp class struggle. Class struggle must be emphasized every day, every month, and every year, and it must be fought to the end. The struggle against selfishness and revisionism must be fought to the end, and the revolution must be carried out to the end.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Conducting study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes." The Party Branch of Dazhai Brigade, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, has since last winter led the masses to conduct Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Now, the entire brigade, from cadres to community members, from elderly people in their seventies and eighties to children in their teens, have all participated in the study.

Dazhai is a red flag personally raised by the great leader Chairman Mao and a shining example of building socialist new rural areas in our country. "Learning from Dazhai in agriculture" is a battle cry issued by the great leader Chairman Mao. However, some community members in Dazhai Brigade have not yet raised their understanding of Dazhai's battle history and growth to the height of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines. In response to this situation, the Party Branch of Dazhai proposed the question of "How did Dazhai's path come about?" and guided the community members to discuss and summarize in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes.

The community members reminisced from the liberation of Dazhai in 1945 to the present day of the Cultural Revolution. In the second year after Dazhai's liberation—1946—the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "organize," deciding to establish mutual aid groups. At that time, the rich peasants of Dazhai also organized "good men's groups," excluding the poor and lower-middle peasants. The excluded poor and lower-middle peasants were mostly old men and children with weak labor power and few livestock. They resolutely followed the path indicated by Chairman Mao, carried forward the spirit of self-reliance, and established the "old and young group." This "old and young group" grew stronger and more numerous in the struggle against the "good men's group." In 1953, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "the only way to achieve collectivization, according to Lenin, is through cooperatives," demanded to expand and upgrade the mutual aid group of forty-nine households into a primary agricultural producers' cooperative. Initially, some people did not allow it, and later, they did not allow it to be so large. However, the poor and lower-middle peasants, through struggle, established the agricultural producers' cooperative. In 1957, the people of Dazhai responded to the Party's call to sell more surplus grain to the state, supporting socialist construction. However, the landlords, rich peasants, and rich peasants in the village opposed it, saying that Chen Yonggui leading the sale of grain was for the model, to eat white steamed buns, and that the cadres of Dazhai were bending their arms outward. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai, who were loyal to the Party and Chairman Mao, firmly refuted the slander and defamation of the landlords and rich peasants. During the temporary economic difficulties of 1960, the people of Dazhai remained steadfast, did not waver, and resisted the capitalist evil winds that emerged in society. During the socialist education movement in 1964, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Shanxi vigorously promoted the bourgeois reactionary line, attempting to uproot the red flag of Dazhai. Led by Comrade Chen Yonggui, the cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai Brigade resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and unyieldingly fought against the bourgeois reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev. These incidents of class struggle and line struggle were presented before the people of Dazhai. They used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, carefully thought, and deeply studied, further understanding the class struggle and line struggle that had occurred in Dazhai since liberation.

On this basis, the cadres and community members of Dazhai, in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, further exposed, denounced, and criticized the Chinese Khrushchev and his frenzied promotion of "exploitation is meritorious," "four freedoms," "three selfs and one package," "the theory of the extinction of class struggle," and the "Peach Garden experience" and other counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods.

Through denunciation and criticism, the people of Dazhai had a deeper understanding of the great and far-reaching significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, further deeply understanding that the path Dazhai had taken in the past was a path of holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing proletarian politics, firmly grasping class struggle, and carrying out the thought revolution of the people. It was a path of adhering to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, resisting, criticizing, and defeating the bourgeois reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev. Through the great denunciation and criticism, everyone had a deeper understanding that following Chairman Mao, following Mao Zedong Thought, and following Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line was revolution, was light, was happiness, and was victory. They said that the path we took in the past was correct, and in the future, we must walk it even better. We must forever be loyal to Chairman Mao and follow Chairman Mao to the end of the revolution.

Comrade Lin Biao said: "In the real class struggle, standing on which side is a matter of stance, a primary issue, and other issues are secondary." The cadres and community members who participated in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, after summarizing the path they had taken in the past and carrying out revolutionary criticism, consciously linked it to themselves, thoroughly excavated their selfish desires, combined the struggle against selfishness with the struggle against revisionism, and further raised their awareness of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines. Through the conscious struggle against selfishness and revisionism, everyone saw more clearly the relationship between selfishness and revisionism, saw the harm of the "self" character, and the more they struggled against selfishness, the more they criticized revisionism, the greater their revolutionary enthusiasm, and the higher their proletarian awareness.

In the process of struggling against selfishness and revisionism, the Party Branch of Dazhai Brigade, following Chairman Mao's teachings, fully trusted the masses, relied on the masses, inspired the masses to use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, carry out self-criticism, and consciously carry out the revolution. For those who had stood on the wrong side at critical moments in the past two-line struggle, they adopted the method of approaching them, uniting them, and conducting positive education and assistance, so that they could consciously carry out the revolution and encourage them to move forward.

After the cadres and community members of Dazhai Brigade raised their awareness of class struggle and line struggle, they launched a new high tide of consciously learning and applying Chairman Mao's works and consciously struggling against selfishness and revisionism. They cherished a "loyalty" to the great leader Chairman Mao, emphasized the "use" of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, severely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and other handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and their agents in Shanxi, consciously exposed their selfish desires. They said: "'Self' is the foundation for the restoration of capitalism and the breeding ground for revisionism. Criticizing revisionism must be combined with struggling against selfishness." "'Self' must be struggled against early to be light, late to be light, not to struggle not to be light, develop it into a disaster." "All disasters come from 'self,' all goodness comes from 'public.'" "The deeper the struggle against selfishness and revisionism, the closer to Chairman Mao; the more severe the struggle against selfishness and revisionism, the closer to Chairman Mao; with a heart for the public, the most loyal to Chairman Mao." They expressed their determination to firmly grasp class struggle and line struggle, to be the new Qu Yuan of the great era of Mao Zedong, to never stop the struggle to overthrow the two mountains of selfishness and revisionism. They must criticize the "revision" deeply and thoroughly, drive the bourgeois "self" out of Dazhai, let the proletarian "public" settle in Dazhai, and build Dazhai into a new world of "public" that forever shines with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought.

    坚决按照毛主席的无产阶级革命路线办事
    大寨大队狠抓阶级斗争和路线斗争教育
    大寨大队党支部领导群众大办毛泽东思想学习班，干部、社员通过回忆对比和总结，更清楚地认识到，社会主义新大寨的出现和成长，是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，战胜中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线和一切阶级敌人的结果。大家决心今后沿着这条道路走下去，永远忠于毛主席，紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底
    新华社太原二十四日电　山西省昔阳县大寨公社大寨大队党支部以毛泽东思想为武器，以大寨解放以来两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争为教材，领导群众大办毛泽东思想学习班，对干部、社员进行阶级斗争和路线斗争教育。干部、社员在学习班里通过回忆对比和总结，更加清楚地认识到，社会主义新大寨的出现和成长，是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛泽东思想，不折不扣地按照毛主席的无产阶级革命路线办事的结果；是以伟大的毛泽东思想为武器，同中国赫鲁晓夫推行的资产阶级反动路线斗，同一切阶级敌人斗，同资产阶级思想和资本主义歪风邪气斗的结果。大寨今后要不断提高，继续发展，永远前进，就必须紧跟伟大统帅毛主席，更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，更坚决地执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，要遵照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，狠抓阶级斗争。对于阶级斗争，要天天讲，月月讲，年年讲，天天抓，月月抓，年年抓，把阶级斗争抓到底，把斗私批修抓到底，把革命进行到底。
    毛主席教导我们说：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”大寨大队党支部紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，从去年冬天开始，就领导群众大办毛泽东思想学习班，到现在全大队从干部到社员，从七八十岁的老人到十来岁的娃娃，都参加了学习。
    大寨是伟大领袖毛主席亲自树立起来的一面红旗，是我国建设社会主义新农村的一个光辉典范。“农业学大寨”，是伟大领袖毛主席发出的战斗号召。但是，大寨大队有些社员对于大寨的战斗历程和成长，还没有提高到两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的高度来认识。针对这种情况，大寨党支部提出“大寨的路子是怎么走过来的”这个问题，引导社员在毛泽东思想学习班里，进行讨论和总结。
    社员们从一九四五年大寨解放一直回忆到无产阶级文化大革命的今天。大寨解放的第二年——一九四六年，大寨的贫下中农响应毛主席“组织起来”的伟大号召，决定办互助组。当时，大寨的富裕中农也组织起“好汉组”，把贫下中农排挤在外。被排挤的贫下中农大都是劳力弱、牲畜少的老汉和娃娃，他们坚决走毛主席指引的道路，发扬自力更生的革命精神，成立了“老少组”，这个“老少组”在同“好汉组”针锋相对的斗争中不断发展壮大。一九五三年，大寨贫下中农遵照毛主席的“达到集体化的唯一道路，依据列宁所说，就是经过合作社”的教导，要求把四十九户的互助组扩大、提高，办成初级农业生产合作社，开始有人不让办，后来又不让办那么大，但是贫下中农经过斗争，把农业生产合作社办起来了。一九五七年，大寨人响应党的号召，多卖余粮给国家，支援社会主义建设，可是村里的地主、富农和富裕中农却起来反对，说什么陈永贵带头多卖粮食，是为了争模范，吃白馍，大寨的干部是胳膊往外弯。忠于党、忠于毛主席的大寨的贫下中农，对地主、富农的造谣、污蔑，进行了坚决的反击。一九六○年暂时经济困难时期，大寨人身不动，膀不摇，坚持社会主义方向，顶住了社会上出现的一股资本主义歪风邪气。一九六四年社会主义教育运动中，中国赫鲁晓夫和他在山西的代理人大搞资产阶级反动路线，妄图把大寨这面红旗砍倒。以陈永贵同志为首的大寨大队的干部和贫下中农坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，坚持不懈地和中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线作斗争。这一件件、一桩桩阶级斗争和路线斗争的事实，摆在大寨人面前。他们以毛泽东思想为武器，细细思考，深入研究，对于解放以来在大寨出现的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，有了进一步的认识。
    在这个基础上，大寨的干部和社员在毛泽东思想学习班里，对中国赫鲁晓夫和他拚命鼓吹的“剥削有功”、“四大自由”、“三自一包”、“阶级斗争熄灭”论和
  “桃园经验”等反革命修正主义黑货，展开了进一步的大揭发、大控诉、大批判。
    通过控诉、批判，大寨人更加深刻地领会了毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场无产阶级文化大革命的伟大深远意义，进一步深刻地认识到，大寨过去走过的道路，是一条高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，狠抓阶级斗争，大搞人的思想革命化的道路，是一条坚持用毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，抵制、批判和战胜中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线的道路。通过大控诉大批判，大家更加深刻地认识到，紧跟毛主席，紧跟毛泽东思想，紧跟毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就是革命，就是光明，就是幸福，就是胜利。他们说，过去的路子我们走得对，今后还要更好地走下去，要永远忠于毛主席，紧跟毛主席革命到底。
    林彪副主席说：“在现实的阶级斗争中，站在那一边，这是个立场问题，是个首要问题，其他都是附带的问题。”参加毛泽东思想学习班的干部和社员在总结了过去走过的道路和开展革命大批判之后，都自觉地联系自己，狠挖私心，把斗私和批修结合起来，进一步提高两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的觉悟。大家通过自觉的斗私批修，更加看清了私和修的关系，看清了“私”字的危害，越斗私越批修，革命干劲越大，无产阶级觉悟越高。
    在斗私批修过程中，大寨大队党支部遵照毛主席的教导，充分相信群众，依靠群众，启发群众运用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，开展自我批评，进行自觉革命。对于个别在过去两条路线斗争的关键时刻站错了队的社员也是采取亲近他们，团结他们，对他们进行正面教育和帮助的办法，让他们自觉革命，鼓励他们前进。
    大寨大队的干部、社员提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟后，掀起了一个自觉地活学活用毛主席著作，自觉地斗私批修的新高潮。他们对伟大领袖毛主席心怀一个“忠”字，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想突出一个“用”字，以毛泽东思想为武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在山西的代理人推行的反革命修正主义黑货，自觉地亮私斗私。他们说：“‘私’字是复辟资本主义的基础，产生修正主义的温床，批修就要结合斗私。”“‘私’字早斗早轻快，迟斗迟轻快，不斗不轻快，发展下去变祸害。”“万祸全从‘私’字起，千好都由‘公’字来。”“斗私批修越深，对毛主席越亲；斗私批修越狠，跟毛主席越紧；一心为公，对毛主席最忠。”他们表示决心狠抓阶级斗争和路线斗争，做伟大的毛泽东时代的新愚公，私和修两座大山不倒，挖山斗争一刻不停止。一定要把“修”字批深批臭，要让资产阶级的“私”字从大寨扫地出门，让无产阶级的“公”字在大寨安家落户，把大寨建设成为一个永远闪耀着毛泽东思想灿烂光辉的“公”字的新世界。
