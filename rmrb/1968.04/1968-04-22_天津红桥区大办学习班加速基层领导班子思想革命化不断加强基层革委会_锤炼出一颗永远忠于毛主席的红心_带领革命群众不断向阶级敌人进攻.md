Tianjin Hongqiao District, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams, has widely established Mao Zedong Thought study classes attended by members of grassroots revolutionary committees, accelerating the ideological revolution of revolutionary leadership teams, and continuously strengthening and consolidating grassroots revolutionary committees, achieving remarkable results.

More than 500 grassroots units in Tianjin Hongqiao District established revolutionary committees around mid-February this year. How to build various levels of revolutionary committees into revolutionary leadership teams that are connected with the masses, and into command headquarters that hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, leading the proletariat and the revolutionary masses to fight against class enemies, has become a major task for various grassroots revolutionary committees. Therefore, starting from early March, all grassroots units in the district, with the help of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams, have widely established study classes attended by members of revolutionary committees, representatives of revolutionary mass organizations, and representatives of old workers. Each study class focuses on solving one or two major problems in practice, lasting from a few days to a couple of weeks, and is held regularly. Most units have already held three sessions. The first session focused on studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions on revolutionary committees, making the students clear about the nature, tasks, and responsibilities of the revolutionary committees. The second session studied Chairman Mao's great teachings on the proletarian revolutionary power, making the students establish the idea of holding and using power with proletarian party spirit. The third session mainly studied Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle," which has now concluded. The fourth session currently being held is studying the recent great instructions of Chairman Mao conveyed in the editorial of the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily, "The Dawn in the Land of Hibiscus."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "A party committee with ten or twenty people is like a squad in the army, and the secretary is like the 'squad leader'.... If this 'squad' does not act in unison, it is impossible to lead tens of millions of people to fight and build." The study classes held in Hongqiao District to promote the ideological revolution of leadership teams pay universal attention to focusing on the leading core of the revolutionary committees, especially the ideological revolution of the first-in-command. The study classes, targeting the active thoughts among new and old cadres, organize everyone to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "Methods of Work of Party Committees" and "Rectifying the Party's Style of Work," and Chairman Mao's latest series of instructions. They take "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guideline, following Chairman Mao's teachings of "putting problems on the table" and "each doing more self-criticism," to achieve openness in exposing personal thoughts without fear of ugliness, fighting selfishness without fear of pain, and changing selfishness without fear of difficulty. Many revolutionary leading cadres who serve as the first-in-command of the revolutionary committees set high standards and strict requirements for themselves, using self-criticism as a weapon, consciously and actively attacking the "self" in their minds. They also actively seek out committee members and old worker representatives to have heart-to-heart talks. They deeply feel that the revolutionary committee must achieve unity and cohesion, forming a fist, first by achieving "unity of mind," that is, everyone has a red heart that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. High Jiancong, the director of the revolutionary committee and former party branch secretary of Tianjin Red Star Paper Box Factory, was initially hesitant and dared not take responsibility, resulting in the revolutionary committee not forming a strong core. In the study class, with the help of new cadres and old workers, he fiercely fought against his selfish thoughts, replacing the "fear" with "dare," taking responsibility seriously in his work, sincerely learning from the strengths of new cadres, enthusiastically helping new cadres progress, and taking responsibility for problems that arise in work, playing the role of a "squad leader," making the revolutionary committee a vigorous and strong fighting collective. Following Chairman Mao's teaching of "soldiers should participate in study classes in the army," these study classes place great importance on inviting old workers to participate in the study classes, helping the revolutionary committee members to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism. Old workers use their personal experiences to conduct class education for the members of the revolutionary committee, raising their awareness of class struggle and line struggle. An old worker from Tianjin Livestock Products Company's Feather Processing Factory, after participating in the study class, saw that some members of the revolutionary committee could not frankly conduct self-criticism, and raised sharp criticisms in the meeting. After the meeting, he actively sought out these members of the revolutionary committee for heart-to-heart talks, patiently doing ideological and political work for them. The old worker's noble revolutionary spirit deeply educated everyone, prompting the committee members to voluntarily expose and fight against their selfish thoughts, strengthening the unity of the revolutionary committee. Many members of the revolutionary committee in the study classes took old workers as examples, treating old workers as teachers, humbly learning from old workers, and resolving to be forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Old workers participating in the study classes also help to strengthen the connection between the revolutionary committee and the masses, improving the relationship between cadres and the masses.

The study classes in Hongqiao District, for each session, establish a good example to solve the problems, as a model for everyone to learn from. They have established many advanced examples in fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism, how to be a good first-in-command, holding power with proletarian party principles, unity between new and old cadres, and adhering to the mass line, and have spread their experiences through small and large meetings to the entire district, promoting the ideological revolution of members of grassroots revolutionary committees. Some study classes also collect various pieces of evidence of class enemies sabotaging the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to hold exhibitions, conducting class struggle and line struggle education, greatly enhancing the awareness of class enemies and proletarian consciousness among new and old cadres.

The study classes held by various grassroots units in Hongqiao District have become battlefields for fully implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions. After the latest instructions from Chairman Mao and the various instructions from the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin are conveyed, various levels of revolutionary committees first organize committee members and the masses in the study classes to repeatedly study and understand them thoroughly, and formulate measures to implement them resolutely. In this way, members of various levels of revolutionary committees are not only the pioneers in studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions but also the model executors and conscious implementers, making the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions fast, accurate, and effective. After the editorial of the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily, "Revolutionary Committees Are Good," was published, it was first studied and discussed in the study classes. The members of the revolutionary committees from various units participating in the study quickly returned to their units to lecture to the revolutionary masses based on their learning experiences, achieving good results.

    天津红桥区大办学习班加速基层领导班子思想革命化不断加强基层革委会
    锤炼出一颗永远忠于毛主席的红心  带领革命群众不断向阶级敌人进攻
    新华社天津二十日电　天津市红桥区在人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，普遍举办有各基层单位革命委员会成员参加的毛泽东思想学习班，加速革命领导班子的思想革命化，不断加强和巩固基层革命委员会，取得显著效果。
    天津市红桥区的五百多个基层单位，在今年二月中旬前后陆续建立起革命委员会。如何把各级革命委员会建设成为革命化的联系群众的领导班子，建设成为高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，带领无产阶级和广大革命群众对于阶级敌人进行战斗的战斗指挥部，成为各基层革命委员会面临的重大任务。因此，从三月初开始，全区各基层单位在人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，普遍办起了有革命委员会成员、革命群众组织代表和老工人代表参加的毛泽东思想学习班。每期学习班结合实际着重解决一、两个主要问题，时间长的十几天，短的则一、两天，并且坚持经常办。这样的学习班，各单位大都已经办了三期。第一期，着重学习毛主席关于革命委员会的一系列最新指示，使学员们明确革委会的性质、任务和职责。第二期，学习毛主席关于无产阶级革命政权的伟大教导，使学员树立用无产阶级党性掌好权、用好权的思想。第三期学习班主要学习毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，现在已经结束。目前正在举办的第四期学习班，正在学习《人民日报》、《解放军报》社论《芙蓉国里尽朝晖》中传达的毛主席最近的伟大指示。
    毛主席教导我们：“党的委员会有一二十个人，象军队的一个班，书记好比是‘班长’。……如果这‘一班人’动作不整齐，就休想带领千百万人去作战，去建设。”红桥区举办的促进领导班子思想革命化的学习班，普遍注意重点抓好革委会的领导核心，特别是第一把手的思想革命化。学习班针对新老干部中存在的活思想，组织大家反复学习毛主席的《党委会的工作方法》、《整顿党的作风》等光辉著作和毛主席的一系列最新指示。他们以“斗私，批修”为纲，按照毛主席
  “要把问题摆到桌面上来”和“各自多做自我批评”的教导，做到亮私心不怕丑，斗私心不怕痛，改私心不怕难。许多担任革委会第一把手的革命领导干部，对自己高标准、严要求，运用自我批评这个武器，自觉地、主动地向自己头脑里的私字开火。他们还主动找委员们和老工人代表交心谈心。他们深有体会地说：革委会要达到同心协力，团结一致，形成一个拳头，首先要做到“同心”，就是大家都有一颗无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的红心。天津市红星纸箱厂革委会主任、原党支部书记高建功，开始工作时束手束脚，不敢大胆负责，结果革委会不能形成一个坚强的核心。在学习班上，他在新干部和老工人的帮助下，狠斗了自己的私心杂念，把“怕”字换成了“敢”字，在工作中认真负责，诚恳地学习新干部的长处，热情地帮助新干部进步，工作中出现问题主动承担责任，起到“班长”的作用，使革委会成为一个朝气蓬勃的坚强的战斗集体。各个学习班遵照毛主席关于“军队办学习班要有战士参加”的教导，十分重视请老工人参加学习班，帮助革命委员会委员斗私批修。老工人们以自己的亲身经历对革委会成员进行阶级教育，提高他们的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟。天津市畜产公司羽毛加工厂的一位老工人参加学习班后，看到个别革委会成员不能坦率地进行自我批评，就在会上提出了尖锐的批评，会后他又主动找这些革委会成员谈心，耐心地向他们做思想政治工作。这位老工人的高尚革命精神，深深教育了大家，促使委员们自觉地亮私斗私，加强了革委会的团结。许多革委会委员在学习班中以老工人为榜样，拜老工人为师，虚心向老工人学习，决心永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。老工人参加学习班，还有利于密切革委会与群众的联系，改善了干群关系。
    红桥区的这些学习班，每期都针对要解决的问题，树立一个好的典型，作为大家学习的榜样。他们已经在全面落实毛主席的最新指示、斗私批修、怎样当好第一把手、以无产阶级党性原则掌权、新老干部团结、坚持群众路线等方面树立起许多先进典型，并且通过小会大会向全区传播了他们的经验，促进了各基层单位革委会成员的思想革命化。有的学习班还把阶级敌人破坏无产阶级文化大革命的各种罪证搜集起来举办展览会，进行阶级斗争和路线斗争教育，大大提高了新老干部的敌情观念和无产阶级觉悟。
    红桥区各基层单位举办的革委会学习班，成为全面落实毛主席一系列最新指示的阵地。毛主席的最新指示和以毛主席为首、以林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部的各项指示传来以后，各级革委会都首先在学习班里组织委员、群众反复学习、认真领会，并制订出措施，雷厉风行地贯彻执行。这样，各级革委会成员对毛主席的最新指示既是带头学习者，又是模范执行者，也是自觉贯彻落实者，使落实毛主席的最新指示做到行动快，不走样，效果好。《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》社论《革命委员会好》发表以后，首先在学习班里组织学习讨论，参加学习的各单位的革委会委员结合自己的学习心得，迅速赶回本单位向革命群众宣讲，效果很好。
