Our great leader Chairman Mao has always shown boundless concern for the youth. He said: "The world is yours, it also belongs to us, but in the end, it is yours. You young people are full of vigor and in your prime, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. Hope is placed on you."

Youth are the future of the country and the world. How to cultivate the youth into successors is an extremely important issue that concerns the future of the country and the destiny of humanity.

The youth movement in our country must adhere to arming the youth with Mao Zedong Thought, guiding the youth to unite with workers and peasants, tempering and growing in the storms of class struggle, and cultivating the youth into successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause who are forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

However, for a long time, the Chinese Khrushchev has been frantically opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in the youth movement in our country, vigorously promoting a counter-revolutionary revisionist line. Under the guise of "caring for the future, ideals, and personal interests of the youth," he advocates bourgeois individualism, luring the youth away from proletarian politics, away from the three great revolutionary movements, away from the workers and peasants, attempting to steer the youth movement onto the track of restoring capitalism, and making the youth into successors of the bourgeoisie.

Arm the Youth with Mao Zedong Thought

The fundamental task of the youth movement is to arm the youth with Mao Zedong Thought.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has always taught the youth to learn Marxism-Leninism, pointing out that the successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause "must be true Marxists-Leninists, not like Khrushchev, who hangs the banner of Marxism-Leninism but is a revisionist." This is the direction of the revolutionization of the youth.

Comrade Lin Biao pointed out: "Mao Zedong Thought is Marxism-Leninism in the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards global victory. Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon against imperialism, a powerful ideological weapon against revisionism and dogmatism. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all work of the entire Party, the entire army, and the entire country." Arming the youth with Mao Zedong Thought is the most fundamental guarantee for our country to prevent revisionism, prevent the restoration of capitalism, and achieve a thorough victory for socialism and communism.

The Chinese Khrushchev attempts to cultivate the youth into tools for restoring capitalism, so he frantically opposes the youth mastering Mao Zedong Thought. In 1953, after he directly took charge of the work of the Youth League, he instructed his lackeys to brazenly remove the original provisions in the league's constitution and charter, such as "educating members with Marxism-Leninism theory and Mao Zedong Thought" and "following the direction indicated by our great leader Comrade Mao Zedong," and erected a signboard called "educating the youth with communist spirit."

In the present era, genuine communist education can only be the education of Mao Zedong Thought; it is impossible to have any "communist education" that separates from Mao Zedong Thought. What kind of "communist education" is the so-called "communist education" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev and his accomplices? They talk about all sorts of things, with numerous names, such as "labor education," "knowledge education," "moral character education," "ideal future education," and "civilized behavior education," and so on. In fact, their so-called "labor education" is to ignore politics and pursue production targets. Their so-called "knowledge education" is to peddle the dregs of exploitative class culture and advocate that culture and technology come first. Their so-called "moral character education" is to promote so-called "friendship," "filial piety," and "honesty" that transcend classes. Their so-called "ideal future education" is to propagate individualism and the theory of "blending public and private interests." Their so-called "civilized behavior education" is to emphasize dressing up and pursuing the lifestyle of the bourgeoisie. They wave the banner of "communism" but sell a complete hodgepodge of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism. This is a genuine fake communist education and true revisionist education.

A few crows' wings cannot cover the dazzling light of Mao Zedong Thought! The youth of our country who have grown up in the era of Mao Zedong have boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty for our great leader Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought. Under the call of Comrade Lin Biao and the leadership of the People's Liberation Army, a vigorous mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in practice has rapidly spread across the country.

As soon as this movement arose, it caused great fear and hatred among the Chinese Khrushchev and his accomplices. They used every means to sabotage the mass movement of the youth studying Mao Zedong Thought. In 1963, Chairman Mao issued the great call to "Learn from Comrade Lei Feng," and Comrade Lin Biao wrote the inscription: "All comrades in the army should learn from the example of Comrade Lei Feng and be good soldiers of Chairman Mao." At this time, the Chinese Khrushchev and another major capitalist-roader within the Party jumped out, vigorously opposing the propaganda that the fundamental path of Lei Feng's growth was to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in practice, and desperately advocating what is "ordinary," "moral character," and "style," distorting the proletarian revolutionary warrior Lei Feng into a specimen of "self-cultivation," attempting to lead the movement to learn from Lei Feng astray.

In 1965, on the eve of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Chinese Khrushchev and his accomplices attacked the youth studying Mao Zedong Thought to the point of madness. They gathered reactionary revisionists such as Peng Zhen, Luo Ruiqing, and Yang Shangkun, singing in unison, frantically opposing the organization of the youth to study Mao Zedong Thought. They raised the banner of "broadening the scope of knowledge" and "organizing the youth to read in various ways," instructing a small clique of capitalist-roaders in the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League to blow a wind of "liberalization" among the youth nationwide. Through propaganda of "models," holding exhibitions, and publishing editorials, they vigorously advocated that studying Chairman Mao's works should be "voluntary participation, free association, self-selected content, and self-determined time," and so on, denying organizational leadership and advocating laissez-faire, attempting to sabotage the movement of the youth studying Chairman Mao's works.

Rain and dew nourish the seedlings, Mao Zedong Thought cultivates new people. Our youth have increasingly deeply felt in the fierce revolutionary struggle that following the great leader Chairman Mao is victory. Studying and defending Mao Zedong Thought is the great historical mission of our revolutionary youth. The youth must take over the baton, which means taking over the baton of Mao Zedong Thought. The fundamental task of the youth movement is to firmly arm the youth with Mao Zedong Thought, promote the revolutionization of the youth's thoughts, and ensure that Mao Zedong Thought is passed down from generation to generation, guaranteeing that our country will never change color.

Class Struggle Is a Major Course for the Youth

Arming the youth with Mao Zedong Thought, the most important thing is to arm the youth with Chairman Mao's great theory on class and class struggle, and on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, so that the youth can distinguish who are the enemies of the revolution and who are the friends of the revolution, firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line, and bravely struggle for the proletariat to seize and consolidate political power. Class struggle is a major course for the youth.

Like all revisionists in the international communist movement, the Chinese Khrushchev has always opposed the youth participating in real class struggle. As early as 1936, after the nationwide "December 9th" movement erupted, as soon as he intervened in the student movement in the north, he vigorously promoted a right-opportunist line. He cursed the students for being "too radical" and "adventurous," luring the students to engage in "cultural entertainment" and "reading activities," echoing the cries of the traitor Hu Shi and his ilk to "save the country through reading," attempting to pull the youth away from the fiery anti-Japanese and national salvation movement into the quiet study.

At the meeting on work in the white areas held in May 1937, he systematically put forward a set of absurd bourgeois reformist propositions to lead the youth movement astray, openly advocating to struggle for the "practical time," "allowances," "career," and other "personal interests" of the youth.

In May 1939, Chairman Mao published the two brilliant works "The May Fourth Movement" and "The Orientation of the Youth Movement," providing the most comprehensive and profound exposition on the direction and tasks of the youth movement. Chairman Mao called on the youth to throw themselves into the great struggle of the workers and peasants, and to strive for the thorough victory of the national democratic revolution. However, just two months later, the Chinese Khrushchev threw out the infamous poisonous weed "Self-Cultivation," urging the broad masses of Communist Party members and revolutionary youth to detach themselves from the fierce national struggle and class struggle, and to engage in the cultivation of morality and character of the feudal and bourgeois classes. His entire approach was completely to meet the needs of the Kuomintang reactionaries, luring the youth onto the path of non-revolution and counter-revolution.

By the socialist period, as the proletarian revolution deepened, the struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat for the youth became sharper and more intense.

Our great leader Chairman Mao systematically summarized the historical experience of the international proletarian dictatorship, deeply pointing out: In this historical stage of socialism, there still exist classes, class contradictions, and class struggle, there is a struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads, and there is the danger of capitalist restoration. Chairman Mao also pointed out many times that many young people growing up in the new society lack political experience and social life experience, and special emphasis must be placed on strengthening the education of the youth on class and class struggle. "Never forget class struggle." Class struggle must be "taught year after year, month after month, day after day."

After the liberation of the whole country, the Chinese Khrushchev vigorously advocated the theory of "class harmony" and "extinction of class struggle," blurring the youth's awareness of class struggle, attempting to lead the youth onto the capitalist road. In 1949, at the first national youth representative conference, he openly propagated the reactionary fallacy of "merit in exploitation," seducing young workers and capitalists to "cooperate," opposing the youth in struggling against the bourgeoisie. In 1952, when the country was in the midst of a series of great struggles such as land reform, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and aid to Korea, he spread the idea of "no more major movements in the future, mainly concentrating on economic construction" and "now it is time for education to save the country" among the youth. He wanted the youth to "hear nothing of world affairs, read only the classics." Especially after the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, he collaborated with the domestic and foreign class enemies in their frenzied calls to oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat, going around to persuade, openly luring the youth to detach themselves from proletarian politics and pursue personal fame and gain.

At this critical moment, Chairman Mao published the brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," stressing the need to strengthen ideological and political work among the youth, pointing out that "without the correct political standpoint, it is as if there is no soul."

The Chinese Khrushchev was unwilling to admit defeat and, together with another major capitalist-roader within the Party, threw out a so-called "six-character policy" of opposing the prominence of proletarian politics and obscuring class struggle at the third national youth league representative conference held on the eve of the anti-rightist struggle. Their so-called "labor" is to bury one's head in production and not ask about politics; their so-called "study" is to study culture and technology purely; their so-called "unity" is to not distinguish classes, not struggle, and unite with everyone. This is the counter-revolutionary revisionist youth work program of the Chinese Khrushchev and his accomplices to lure the youth onto the capitalist road since the entry of our country into the period of socialist revolution. The Soviet Khrushchev once said: "The great task of social transformation requires the youth to have rich knowledge, skilled hands, and a sincere heart." He wanted to "cultivate the youth into laborers and peace-lovers." Look! How similar this is to the "labor, study, unity" of the Chinese Khrushchev and his accomplices!

Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought have never denied that the youth should actively labor and study hard. However, as long as there are still classes and class struggle in society, the youth, no matter what work and study they engage in, must emphasize proletarian politics and cannot detach themselves from class struggle. Forgetting class struggle, forgetting the dictatorship of the proletariat, and forgetting the continuation of the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat is to forget the fundamental viewpoint of Mao Zedong Thought, which is equivalent to having no soul and will definitely lose direction. The Chinese Khrushchev and his accomplices oppose the youth actively participating in the struggle to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, which is another piece of ironclad evidence that they lure the youth to serve the restoration of capitalism.

Be the Vanguard of the Proletariat

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The youth are the most active and vigorous part of the entire social force. They are the most eager to learn and have the least conservative thoughts, especially in the socialist era." "'Since the May Fourth Movement, what role have the Chinese youth played? They have played a certain vanguard role." Chairman Mao has always supported youth revolution, arming the youth with the spirit of thorough proletarian revolution, educating the youth to dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, daring to rebel against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, daring to rebel against a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party, daring to rebel against the entire old world. Forever loyal to Chairman Mao, carrying forward the revolutionary spirit of rebellion against class enemies, is the essence of the youth in the era of Mao Zedong.

The Chinese Khrushchev, in order to promote the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, used every means to suppress the revolutionary spirit of rebellion among the youth. In 1958, when the youth across the country enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call to emancipate the mind and break away from superstition, and were making great revolutions and rebelling against the bourgeoisie, he maliciously threw out the extremely reactionary theory of "tame tools," vigorously promoting slavery in the youth. He and another major capitalist-roader within the Party, as well as the reactionary revisionist Peng Zhen, repeatedly spread at the meetings of the Communist Youth League: "The youngsters don't understand," "the general direction... you young league should not interfere with," "the policy of the league has been solved," and so on. In a word, they did not allow the members of the Communist Youth League and the broad masses of youth to care about state affairs and world revolutionary affairs. At the same time, they shamelessly dressed themselves up as the embodiment of the Party, wanting the league cadres, members, and youth to obediently follow them, "even if they are wrong, they must obey." They attempted to make the Communist Youth League organization and the broad masses of youth degenerate into their "tame tools" for usurping the Party, usurping the country, and restoring capitalism.

In June and July 1966, as soon as the Red Guards were born, the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League were terrified. They first slandered this new thing that emerged in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as "illegal" and "reactionary," attempting to forcibly "dissolve" it through organizational means; then they shouted to "absorb" and "bring it onto the right track," and carried out savage suppression, branding a batch of revolutionary youngsters as "monsters and demons." At this critical moment, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao gave the Red Guards great care. Chairman Mao enthusiastically praised the heroic Red Guards for having "rebellion against the reactionaries is justified" and personally received several million Red Guards from all over the country. From then on, the Red Guard movement swept across the country, shook the world, and fully played the vanguard role of the youth. In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they established immortal merits.

The history of class struggle shows that class enemies are most afraid of the youth being the vanguard of the revolution, and they are accustomed to deceiving and using the youth to serve their counter-revolutionary conspiracies. When the youth are about to charge for the interests of the proletariat, they suppress youth revolution and suffocate the revolutionary spirit of rebellion among the youth; on the contrary, when the bourgeoisie is fiercely attacking the proletariat, they incite the youth to follow them to attack the Party and socialism. In 1957, when the rightists were rampantly attacking, the Chinese Khrushchev, together with another major capitalist-roader within the Party, vigorously advocated that the youth should have the so-called "independent thinking" and "willpower character" of daring to "resist," spreading evil winds and kindling ghostly fires. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, after the Chinese Khrushchev's plot to suppress youth revolution was smashed, the counter-revolutionary two-faced Tao Zhu and his ilk vigorously advocated the reactionary fallacy of "doubt everything" and "overthrow everything," inciting the youth to rebel chaotically and bombard the proletarian headquarters. Therefore, in the sharp and complex class struggle, we must study and apply Chairman Mao's works in practice, use Mao Zedong Thought to observe everything, analyze everything, stand firmly on the proletarian standpoint, recognize the direction of socialism and communism, and not be deceived by class enemies. To be a vanguard, one must be the vanguard of the proletarian revolution, the vanguard of consolidating and strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat, the vanguard of learning, applying, propagating, and defending Mao Zedong Thought, and the vanguard of implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Walk the Path of Unity with Workers and Peasants

Uniting with workers and peasants is the revolutionary direction that our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out for the youth of China and the world. Chairman Mao pointed out: "How do we judge whether a youth is revolutionary? What standard do we use? What do we use to distinguish him? There is only one standard, that is, whether he is willing and actually unites with the broad masses of workers and peasants."

Workers and peasants are the creators of world history and the main force of the revolution. The youth can only unite with the workers and peasants to carry out great revolutionary struggles; only by learning from the workers and peasants and establishing a worldview of serving the people wholeheartedly can they become successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Like all representatives of the exploiting classes, the Chinese Khrushchev has always opposed the workers and peasants, looked down upon them, and opposed the youth uniting with the workers and peasants.

As early as the period of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chinese Khrushchev vigorously peddled the black "Self-Cultivation," opposing the youth uniting with the workers and peasants. After the liberation of the whole country, the Chinese Khrushchev, under the pretext of the need for the new situation of economic construction, vigorously advocated the "white specialist" road of individual struggle and fame, saying that the youth "mainly learn culture and technology," "as long as you master one specialty, you will become famous and successful in the future, and you will have everything," luring the youth to detach themselves from proletarian politics and the workers and peasants, becoming spiritual aristocrats who stand above the laboring people.

In 1955, after the country achieved agricultural cooperation nationwide, Chairman Mao issued the great call: "All such intellectuals who can go to the countryside to work should be happy to go there. The countryside is a vast world where one can achieve great things." The broad masses of youth enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call, flocking to the countryside and mountains, walking the revolutionary road of uniting with the workers and peasants. Under this situation, the Chinese Khrushchev changed tactics, going around to persuade, saying that going to the countryside is not a "loss," and one can become an "official" in the future. He carefully designed a "roadmap to officialdom in the countryside" for the youth going to the countryside, that is, relying on one's own "culture," going to the countryside to "work the land for three to five years," and "getting along well with the masses," one can strive to "become the chairman of the commune, the head of the township, the head of the county," "become a member of the Central Committee," and so on. In his view, temporarily participating in labor is to permanently detach oneself from labor; temporarily living with the workers and peasants is to permanently ride on the heads of the laboring people and lord over them. Chairman Mao teaches us: "We Communists are not here to be officials, but to make revolution." The evil purpose of the Chinese Khrushchev spreading the philosophy of officialdom and wealth among the youth is to pull the youth back from the revolutionary road of uniting with the workers and peasants into the dead end of bourgeois individualism.

Countless historical facts prove that whoever detaches themselves from the workers and peasants is detaching themselves from the revolution; whoever opposes the workers and peasants is opposing the revolution. Since the May Fourth Movement, in the several decades of youth movement, how many figures have emerged, but in the blink of an eye, some, due to detaching themselves from the workers and peasants, have achieved nothing and have become transient figures on the historical stage; some have gone from opposing the workers and peasants to the counter-revolutionary camp. Only those who firmly adhere to uniting with the workers and peasants, advancing along the revolutionary road indicated by Chairman Mao, can temper themselves into strong warriors of the proletariat, forever preserve revolutionary youth, and continuously achieve new merits for the people.

Whether or not one can adhere to uniting with the workers and peasants is a worldview issue. The Chinese Khrushchev, in order to lure the youth to detach themselves from the workers and peasants and walk the capitalist road, sometimes advocates "studying in seclusion" to become famous and successful, sometimes advocates "going to the countryside to get a gold-plated education" and then climb up, but the essence is always the same, which is the character of "self." We must thoroughly criticize the bourgeois "self" and firmly establish the proletarian "public," seriously reform our worldview. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation." Only in the long-term revolutionary struggle, in the process of uniting with the workers and peasants, following Chairman Mao's great instruction to "criticize and repudiate selfishness and revisionism," constantly studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in practice, can we truly unite with the workers and peasants in thoughts and feelings, overcome various forms of bourgeois thoughts such as individualism, subjectivism, and anarchism, and establish a worldview of serving the public wholeheartedly. This is the revolutionary direction that the youth must strive for all their lives.

Loving the workers and peasants, adhering to uniting with the workers and peasants, and learning from the workers and peasants is an important sign that the youth are loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Only by throwing oneself into the fiery revolutionary struggle of the workers and peasants can one truly master Mao Zedong Thought, turn Mao Zedong Thought into one's soul, and grow into reliable successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

    永远忠于毛主席　做无产阶级革命事业接班人
    ——彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义青年运动路线
    共青团中央机关无产阶级革命派
    我们伟大领袖毛主席对青年无限关怀。他说：“世界是你们的，也是我们的，但是归根结底是你们的。你们青年人朝气蓬勃，正在兴旺时期，好象早晨八、九点钟的太阳。希望寄托在你们身上。”
    青年是国家的未来，是世界的未来。把青年培养成什么样的接班人，这是关系到国家前途、人类命运的极其重大的问题。
    我国的青年运动，必须坚持用毛泽东思想武装青年，引导青年同工农相结合，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中锻炼成长，把青年培养成为永远忠于毛主席、永远忠于毛泽东思想、永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的无产阶级革命事业接班人。
    但是，长期以来，中国赫鲁晓夫在我国青年运动中疯狂反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，极力推行一条反革命修正主义路线。他打着“关心青年的前途、理想和切身利益”的幌子，鼓吹资产阶级利己主义，引诱青年脱离无产阶级政治，脱离三大革命运动，脱离工农群众，妄图把青年运动纳入他复辟资本主义的轨道，使青年成为资产阶级的接班人。
      用毛泽东思想武装青年
      是青年运动的根本任务
    我们伟大领袖毛主席历来教导青年要学习马克思列宁主义，指出无产阶级革命事业接班人“必须是真正的马克思列宁主义者，而不是象赫鲁晓夫那样的挂着马克思列宁主义招牌的修正主义者。”这是青年革命化的方向问题。
    林彪副主席指出：“毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想是反对帝国主义的强大的思想武器，是反对修正主义和教条主义的强大的思想武器。毛泽东思想是全党、全军和全国一切工作的指导方针。”用毛泽东思想把青年一代武装起来，是使我国防止修正主义、防止资本主义复辟，取得社会主义和共产主义彻底胜利的最根本的保证。
    中国赫鲁晓夫妄图把青年一代培养成复辟资本主义的工具，所以疯狂反对青年掌握毛泽东思想。一九五三年，他直接插手掌管青年团工作后，就指使他的走卒悍然把原来团纲团章中“以马克思列宁主义理论、毛泽东思想教育团员”和“遵循我们伟大领袖毛泽东同志指引的方向”砍掉了，树起了一块所谓
  “用共产主义精神教育青年”的招牌。
    在现时代，真正的共产主义教育，只能是毛泽东思想的教育，不可能有离开毛泽东思想的什么“共产主义教育”。中国赫鲁晓夫及其同伙鼓吹的所谓“共产主义教育”是什么货色呢？说起来五花八门，名目繁多，什么“劳动教育”啦，什么“知识教育”啦，什么“道德品质教育”啦，什么“理想前途教育”啦，还有什么“文明行为教育”啦，等等。其实，他们所说的“劳动教育”，就是不问政治，单纯追求生产指标。他们所说的“知识教育”，就是贩卖剥削阶级文化糟粕，鼓吹文化、技术第一。他们所说的“道德品质教育”，就是提倡超阶级的所谓“友谊”、“孝道”、“诚实”。他们所说的“理想前途教育”，就是宣扬利己主义、
  “公私融化”论。他们所说的“文明行为教育”，就是讲究打扮，追求资产阶级生活方式。他们打的是“共产主义”的招牌，卖的完全是封建主义、资本主义和修正主义的大杂烩。这是地地道道的假共产主义教育，真修正主义教育。
    几只乌鸦的翅膀，怎能遮住毛泽东思想的万丈光芒！在毛泽东时代成长起来的我国青年，对伟大领袖毛主席，对伟大的毛泽东思想，无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜，无限忠诚。在林彪同志的号召下，在中国人民解放军的带动下，在广大青年中，一个蓬蓬勃勃的、活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，迅速在全国范围内开展起来。
    这个运动一兴起，就引起了中国赫鲁晓夫及其同伙的极大恐惧和仇恨。他们千方百计地破坏青年学习毛泽东思想的群众运动。一九六三年，毛主席发出
  “向雷锋同志学习”的伟大号召，林彪同志题词指出：
  “全军同志都应当学习雷锋同志的榜样做毛主席的好战士”。就在这时，中国赫鲁晓夫和党内另一个最大的走资派一起跳了出来，极力反对宣传雷锋成长的根本道路是活学活用毛主席著作，拚命宣扬什么“平凡”、
  “品德”和“风格”，把无产阶级的革命战士雷锋歪曲成为一个“自我修养”的标本，妄图把学习雷锋的运动引向邪路。
    一九六五年，无产阶级文化大革命前夜，中国赫鲁晓夫及其同伙对青年学习毛泽东思想的攻击，达到了疯狂的地步。他们把彭真、罗瑞卿和杨尚昆等反革命修正主义分子纠集在一起，此唱彼和，疯狂地反对组织青年学习毛泽东思想。他们打起“知识面要搞得宽一点”、“多方面组织青年读书”的幌子，指使共青团中央的一小撮走资派在全国青年中吹起了一阵“自由化”的妖风。他们通过宣传“典型”、举办展览、发表社论，大肆鼓吹学习毛主席著作应该“自愿参加，自由结合，自选内容，自定时间”，等等，否定组织领导，提倡放任自流，妄图搞垮青年学习毛主席著作运动。
    雨露滋润禾苗壮，毛泽东思想育新人。我国青年在激烈的革命斗争中，越来越深刻地体会到：跟着伟大领袖毛主席就是胜利。学习和捍卫毛泽东思想，是我国革命青年的伟大历史使命。青年一代要接班，就是要接毛泽东思想的班。青年运动的根本任务，就是要坚定不移地用毛泽东思想武装青年，促进青年思想革命化，使毛泽东思想代代相传，保证我国永不变色。
    阶级斗争是青年的一门主课
    用毛泽东思想武装青年，最重要的一条就是用毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争、关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的伟大理论武装青年，使青年分清谁是革命的敌人，谁是革命的朋友，坚定地站在无产阶级革命路线一边，勇敢地为无产阶级夺取政权和巩固政权而斗争。阶级斗争是青年的一门主课。
    中国赫鲁晓夫同国际共产主义运动中的一切修正主义者一样，一贯反对青年参加现实的阶级斗争。早在一九三六年，震撼全国的“一二·九”运动爆发后，他一插手北方的学生运动，就极力推行一条右倾机会主义路线。他咒骂学生“过火”、“冒险”，引诱学生去开展“文化娱乐”、“读书活动”，同卖国贼胡适之流“读书救国”的叫嚣相呼应，企图把青年从火热的抗日救亡运动中，拉到平静的书斋。在一九三七年五月召开的白区工作会议上，他更系统地提出了一整套把青年运动引向邪路的资产阶级改良主义的荒谬主张，公开鼓吹要为青年的“实习时间”、“津贴”、“职业”等
  “切身利益”而斗争。
    一九三九年五月，毛主席发表了《五四运动》和《青年运动的方向》两篇光辉著作，对青年运动的方向和任务作了最全面、最精辟的论述。毛主席号召青年投身到工农群众的伟大斗争中去，为争取民族民主革命的彻底胜利而奋斗。可是，刚刚过了两个月，中国赫鲁晓夫就抛出了臭名昭著的大毒草《修养》，要广大共产党员和革命青年脱离激烈的民族斗争和阶级斗争，去搞封建阶级、资产阶级的修身养性。他这一套，完全是为着适应国民党反动派的需要，引诱青年走向不革命和反革命的道路。
    到了社会主义时期，随着无产阶级革命的深入发展，资产阶级同无产阶级争夺青年的斗争更加尖锐，更加激烈。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席系统地总结了国际无产阶级专政的历史经验，极其深刻地指出：在社会主义这个历史阶段中，还存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，存在着社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争，存在着资本主义复辟的危险性。毛主席还多次指出，生长在新社会的不少青年人，缺乏政治经验和社会生活经验，要特别加强对青年进行阶级、阶级斗争的教育。“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”。阶级斗争要“年年讲，月月讲，天天讲”。
    中国赫鲁晓夫在全国解放后，却大肆鼓吹“阶级调和”论、“阶级斗争熄灭”论，模糊青年的阶级斗争观念，妄图把青年引向资本主义道路。一九四九年，在全国青年第一次代表大会上，他公开宣扬“剥削有功”的反动谬论，诱惑青年工人和资本家“合作”，反对青年向资产阶级作斗争。一九五二年，正当全国轰轰烈烈地进行土地改革、镇压反革命和抗美援朝等一系列伟大斗争的时候，他就向青年散布什么“大的运动今后不可能再有了，主要是集中精力搞经济建设”，
  “现在需要教育救国了”。他要青年“两耳不闻天下事，一心只读圣贤书”。特别是在生产资料所有制方面的社会主义改造基本完成以后，他更配合国内外阶级敌人反对无产阶级专政的疯狂叫嚣，到处游说，公开引诱青年脱离无产阶级政治，追求个人名利。
    正在这个关键时刻，毛主席发表了《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这篇光辉著作，强调要加强对青年的思想政治工作，指出“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂”。
    中国赫鲁晓夫不甘心失败，又伙同党内另一个最大的走资派在反右派斗争前夕召开的青年团第三次代表大会上，抛出了一个反对突出无产阶级政治，抹煞阶级斗争的“劳动、学习、团结”的所谓“六字方针”。他们的所谓“劳动”，就是埋头生产，不问政治；他们的所谓“学习”，就是单纯学文化，学技术；他们的所谓“团结”，就是不分阶级，不要斗争，团结一切人。这是我国进入社会主义革命时期以来，中国赫鲁晓夫及其同伙妄图引诱青年走资本主义道路的反革命修正主义青年工作纲领。苏联赫鲁晓夫曾经胡说什么：“社会改造的伟大任务要求青年有丰富的知识，能干的双手，一颗赤诚的心。”他要“把青年培养成为劳动与和平的人”。瞧！这同中国赫鲁晓夫及其同伙的“劳动、学习、团结”是多么相象！
    马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，从来也不否定青年应该积极劳动，努力学习，搞好团结。但是，只要社会上还存在着阶级和阶级斗争，青年们无论从事任何工作和学习，都必须突出无产阶级政治，都不能脱离阶级斗争。忘记了阶级斗争，忘记了无产阶级专政，忘记了无产阶级专政下继续革命，就是忘记了毛泽东思想的根本观点，就等于没有灵魂，就一定要迷失方向。中国赫鲁晓夫及其同伙反对青年积极参加巩固无产阶级专政的斗争，正是他们引诱青年为复辟资本主义效劳的又一个铁证。
      当无产阶级的革命先锋
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“青年是整个社会力量中的一部分最积极最有生气的力量。他们最肯学习，最少保守思想，在社会主义时代尤其是这样。”“‘五四’以来，中国青年们起了什么作用呢？起了某种先锋队的作用”。毛主席最支持青年革命，用无产阶级彻底革命的精神武装青年，教育青年敢想敢说敢干，敢于造帝国主义、修正主义、各国反动派的反，敢于造党内一小撮走资派的反，敢于造整个旧世界的反。永远忠于毛主席，发扬对阶级敌人的革命造反精神，是毛泽东时代革命青年的本质。
    中国赫鲁晓夫为了推行反革命修正主义路线，千方百计地扼杀青年的革命造反精神。一九五八年，正当全国青年热烈响应毛主席关于解放思想、破除迷信的伟大号召，大搞革命，大造资产阶级的反的时候，他别有用心地抛出了反动透顶的“驯服工具”论，在青年中极力推行奴隶主义。他和党内另一个最大的走资派以及反革命修正主义分子彭真，多次在共青团的会议上散布：“青年娃娃不懂事”，“总的方向……你们青年团不要管了”，“青年团的方针解决了”，等等。一句话，他们就是不准共青团员和广大青年关心国家大事，世界革命的大事。同时，又恬不知耻地把他们自己装扮成党的化身，要团的干部、团员和青年乖乖地跟着他们走，“错了也要服从”。他们妄图使共青团组织和广大青年蜕化成为他们篡党、篡国、复辟资本主义的“驯服工具”。
    一九六六年六、七月间，红卫兵一诞生，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在共青团中央的代理人就闻风丧胆。他们对这个在无产阶级文化大革命中出现的新生事物，始则诬蔑为“非法”的、“反动”的，企图用组织手段强行
  “解散”；接着，就叫嚷要“溶化”，“纳入正轨”，并进行野蛮的镇压，把一批批革命小将打成“牛鬼蛇神”。正在这关键时刻，我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席给了红卫兵以极大的关怀。毛主席热烈赞扬英雄的红卫兵
  “对反动派造反有理”，并亲自接见了来自全国各地的一千几百万红卫兵。从此红卫兵运动席卷全国，震撼世界，充分地发挥了青年的革命先锋作用，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，立下了不朽的功勋。
    阶级斗争的历史表明，阶级敌人最害怕青年当革命的先锋，又惯于欺骗、利用青年为其反革命阴谋效劳。当着青年要为无产阶级利益冲锋陷阵的时候，他们压制青年革命，扼杀青年的革命造反精神；相反，在资产阶级向无产阶级猖狂进攻的时候，他们就煽动青年跟着他们去攻击党和社会主义。一九五七年右派猖狂进攻的时候，中国赫鲁晓夫伙同党内另一个最大的走资派，大肆宣扬青年要有所谓敢于“反抗”的“独立思考”、“意志性格”，煽阴风，点鬼火。在无产阶级文化大革命中，当中国赫鲁晓夫压制青年革命的阴谋被粉碎以后，反革命两面派陶铸之流又竭力鼓吹“怀疑一切”、“打倒一切”的反动谬论，煽动青年乱造反，炮打无产阶级司令部。因此，我们在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，一定要活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想去观察一切，分析一切，站稳无产阶级的立场，认清社会主义、共产主义的方向，不上阶级敌人的当。当先锋，就要当无产阶级的革命先锋，当巩固和加强无产阶级专政的先锋，当学习、运用、宣传和捍卫毛泽东思想的先锋，当贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的先锋。
      走和工农相结合的道路
    同工农群众相结合，是我们伟大领袖毛主席给中国和世界青年运动指出的革命方向。毛主席指出：“看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。”
    工农群众是创造世界历史的动力，是革命的主力军。青年一代只有同工农群众结合在一块，才能进行伟大的革命斗争；只有向工农学习，树立起全心全意为人民服务的世界观，才能成为无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    中国赫鲁晓夫同一切剥削阶级的代表人物一样，历来反对工农，轻视工农，反对青年同工农相结合。
    早在抗日战争时期，中国赫鲁晓夫就大肆贩卖黑《修养》，反对青年同工农相结合。全国解放以后，中国赫鲁晓夫又借口经济建设新形势的需要，极力鼓吹个人奋斗、成名成家的“白专”道路。他说什么青年
  “主要是学文化、学技术”，“只要学好一门专长，将来会成名成家，就有了一切”，诱使青年脱离无产阶级政治，脱离工农，成为高踞于劳动人民头上的精神贵族。
    一九五五年全国实现农业合作化以后，毛主席发出伟大号召：“一切可以到农村中去工作的这样的知识分子，应当高兴地到那里去。农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的。”广大青年热烈响应毛主席的号召，纷纷下乡上山，走同工农相结合的革命道路。在这种形势下，中国赫鲁晓夫变换手法，四出游说，大讲下乡并不“吃亏”，将来可以“当官”。他精心地为下乡知识青年“设计”了一幅“回乡升官图”，即仗着自己“有文化”，下乡“种三五年地”，“搞好和群众的关系”，就可以争取“当社长、当乡长、当县长”，“成为中央委员”，等等。在他看来，暂时参加劳动，是为了永远脱离劳动；暂时同工农一起生活，是为了永远骑在劳动人民头上作威作福。毛主席教导我们：“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命”。中国赫鲁晓夫向青年散布升官发财的市侩哲学的罪恶目的，就是要把青年从同工农结合的革命化大道上拉回到资产阶级个人主义的死胡同里去。
    无数历史事实证明，谁脱离工农，就是脱离革命；谁反对工农，就是反对革命。“五四”以来，几十年的青年运动中，曾经涌现过多少风云人物，但是曾几何时，有的由于脱离了工农，一事无成，有如昙花一现，成为历史舞台上的匆匆过客；有的由反对工农而走到反革命营垒中去了。只有那些脚踏实地坚持同工农相结合，沿着毛主席指引的革命化大道前进的人，才能锻炼成为无产阶级的坚强战士，永葆革命的青春，不断为人民立新功。
    能不能坚持同工农群众相结合，这是一个世界观问题。中国赫鲁晓夫为了引诱青年脱离工农，走资本主义道路，时而鼓吹“闭门读书”，成名成家，时而宣扬“下乡镀金”，再向上爬，万变不离其宗，都是一个“私”字。我们必须大破资产阶级的“私”字，大立无产阶级的“公”字，认真改造自己的世界观。毛主席教导我们：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。只有在长期的革命斗争中，在同工农相结合的过程中，遵照毛主席“斗私，批修”的伟大指示，不断地活学活用毛主席著作，才能真正从思想感情上同工农群众打成一片，才能克服个人主义、主观主义和无政府主义等形形色色的资产阶级思想，树立一心为公的共产主义世界观。这是青年一代一辈子要坚持奋斗的革命方向。
    热爱工农，坚持同工农相结合，向工农学习，是青年一代忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的重要标志之一。只有投身到工农群众的火热的革命斗争中，才能真正把毛泽东思想学到手，把毛泽东思想化为自己的灵魂，成长为无产阶级革命事业的坚强可靠的接班人。
