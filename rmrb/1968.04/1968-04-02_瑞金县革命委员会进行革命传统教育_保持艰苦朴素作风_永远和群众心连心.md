    Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "The most fundamental point in the reform of state organs is to maintain close ties with the masses."

    The Revolutionary Committee of Ruijin County in Jiangxi Province, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions on "carrying forward the revolutionary tradition and striving for greater glory," has conducted revolutionary tradition education for the members of the county revolutionary committee. They have carried forward the fine tradition of maintaining close ties with the masses and have built the county revolutionary committee into a revolutionary and battle-ready command center that is forever loyal to Chairman Mao and maintains close ties with the masses.

    Chairman Mao has taught us: "Winning nationwide victory is only the first step in the Long March of ten thousand li. The Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is longer, and the work is greater and more arduous. We must ensure that comrades continue to maintain the spirit of hard struggle." The members of the county revolutionary committee have deeply engraved Chairman Mao's great teachings in their minds and put them into practice. After the founding and celebration meeting of the county revolutionary committee, they had a bitter meal and, standing before Chairman Mao's portrait, swore: "We will forever maintain the character of the working people and carry forward the glorious revolutionary tradition of hard struggle."

    After the meeting, the members of the county revolutionary committee, with boundless class feelings of love for the great leader Chairman Mao, carrying Chairman Mao's portrait and Chairman Mao's quotations, with their luggage on their backs, singing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, walked to the former site of the Provisional Central Government of the Chinese Soviet Republic - Shazhou Bank. They paid tribute to Chairman Mao's former residence and the red well that Chairman Mao personally dug. In Chairman Mao's former residence, they studied word by word and sentence by sentence the four brilliant works that Chairman Mao wrote there: "We Must Pay Attention to Economic Work," "How to Analyze the Class Situation in the Countryside," "Our Economic Policy," and "Care for the People's Livelihood and Pay Attention to Methods of Work." They also invited revolutionary elders to recount how Chairman Mao, in those days, conducted investigations and research among the people, trusted the people, relied on the people, and cared for the people's production and livelihood, as well as his simple and austere revolutionary practices. Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practices gave them a profound education. That night, the members of the revolutionary committee, following Chairman Mao's teachings, went deep into the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants and old revolutionaries to hold discussion meetings and investigation meetings. With the attitude of being willing to be small students, they learned about the situation of class struggle and revolutionary criticism in the countryside and humbly listened to the voices and demands of the masses. An old poor peasant told the former county committee secretary and current revolutionary committee chairman, Comrade Xu Congzhong: "In the past, some people were detached from the masses and did not listen to the opinions of the masses; you must maintain close ties with the masses and listen to the opinions of the masses." Comrade Xu Congzhong was greatly educated and inspired. He deeply felt and said to this old poor peasant: "We will definitely change the high-and-mighty, bureaucratic style. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's words, be the small students of the masses, and forever be heart-to-heart with the poor and lower-middle peasants, sharing the same breath and destiny, serving the people wholeheartedly." The next day, as soon as it was dawn, Xu Congzhong led the members of the revolutionary committee to clean Chairman Mao's former residence and the homes of the people. They also went to the red well that the great leader Chairman Mao once led the Central Soviet Area workers to dig for the people, carrying water for the poor and lower-middle peasants, and repaired a section of the road that had been damaged by rainwater. They said: "This is the road that Chairman Mao walked on, and it should be repaired. We will forever follow Chairman Mao and walk with the people on the broad road of socialism." Along the road to the red well, they also planted evergreen cypress trees. They said: "We will be like pines and cypresses, forever preserving revolutionary youth." To learn from Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practices and forever be heart-to-heart with the poor and lower-middle peasants, the members of the county revolutionary committee braved the biting cold wind, barefoot, plowed and tilled in a bean field where Chairman Mao once worked, and decided to make this plot of land the "experimental field" of the revolutionary committee's standing committee members, the "model field" of high yield and bumper harvest, and the "educational field" for cultivating successors. They are determined to forever participate in collective production labor and forever maintain the character of the working people.

    Through these activities, the members of the county revolutionary committee received a vivid and profound revolutionary tradition education. They are determined to engrave a "loyal" character in their souls, forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and forever loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The members of the revolutionary committee, walking to Shazhou Bank for revolutionary tradition education, received enthusiastic praise from the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary elders, and grassroots cadres. They excitedly said: "The good cadres educated by Chairman Mao, we trust."

    毛主席最近教导我们：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”
    瑞金县革命委员会进行革命传统教育
    保持艰苦朴素作风  永远和群众心连心
    据新华社南昌一日电　江西瑞金县革命委员会遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的教导，对县革委会成员进行革命传统教育，发扬密切联系群众的好作风，把县革委会建设成为永远忠于毛主席、和群众保持血肉联系的革命化的战斗指挥部。
    毛主席教导我们说：“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。……中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。……务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。”县革委会委员们把毛主席这一伟大教导深深地铭刻在脑子里，落实在行动上。他们在县革委会成立和庆祝大会开完后，吃了一顿忆苦饭，一齐在毛主席像前宣誓：永远保持劳动人民的本色，发扬艰苦奋斗的光荣革命传统。
    会后，县革委会委员们怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的阶级感情，举着毛主席的画像和毛主席语录牌，背着行李，唱着毛主席语录歌，步行来到当年中华苏维埃共和国临时中央政府所在地——沙洲坝。他们瞻仰了毛主席的旧居和毛主席亲手挖的红井；在毛主席旧居逐字逐句地学习了毛主席在这里写的四篇光辉著作：《必须注意经济工作》、《怎样分析农村阶级》、《我们的经济政策》、《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》。还请革命老人讲述了当年毛主席深入群众调查研究，相信群众，依靠群众，关心群众的生产和生活，以及艰苦朴素等革命实践。毛主席的伟大革命实践，使他们受到极大的教育。当天晚上，革委会委员们便遵循毛主席的教导，深入到贫下中农、老红军家里，开座谈会和调查会。他们抱着甘当小学生的态度，了解农村阶级斗争和革命大批判的情况，虚心听取群众的呼声和要求。一个老贫农对原县委书记、现革委会主任徐从忠同志说：过去，有些人脱离群众，不听群众的意见；你们一定要联系群众，听取群众的意见。徐从忠同志受到很大的教育和启发。他深有感受地对这位老贫农说：“我们一定坚决改变那种高高在上、官僚主义的作风。我们一定听毛主席的话，做群众的小学生，永远和贫下中农心连心，同呼吸，共命运，全心全意为人民服务。”第二天，天刚刚亮，徐从忠就率领革委会的委员们把毛主席旧居和群众住房打扫得干干净净。他们还到伟大领袖毛主席当年带领中央苏区工作人员为群众挖的红井边，为贫下中农挑水，并且修好了一段被雨水冲坏了的路面。他们说：“这是毛主席走过的路，应该修好。我们要永远跟着毛主席走，和人民群众一道永远走社会主义的康庄大道。”在去红井的大路两旁，他们还种上了四季长青的柏树。他们说：我们要象松柏一样，永葆革命青春。为了学习毛主席的伟大革命实践，永远和贫下中农心连心，县革委会委员们冒着刺骨的寒风，打着赤脚，在毛主席当年劳动过的一块豆田里犁田、打土，并决定把这丘田作为革委会常委们的“试验田”，作为高产丰收的“样板田”，作为培养接班人的“教育田”。他们决心永远参加集体生产劳动，永远保持劳动人民的本色。
    经过这些活动，县革委会委员们都受到一次很生动、很深刻的革命传统教育。他们决心在灵魂深处刻上一个“忠”字，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。革委会委员们步行来到沙洲坝上革命传统教育课，受到广大贫下中农、革命老人和基层干部的热烈赞扬。他们激动地说：毛主席教育出来的好干部，我们信得过。
