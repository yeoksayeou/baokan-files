	To lead with Mao Zedong Thought, to carry out ideological transformation of the people, is the politics of politics, the soul of the soul, the core of the core. Facts have repeatedly proven that in any situation, we must first grasp politics, grasp ideology, and actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works.

	At a recent conference of active participants in the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought held by the Shenyang Military Region, many representatives from advanced units and individuals shared their experiences in emphasizing proletarian politics, leading with Mao Zedong Thought, and carrying out ideological transformation of the people. Here are excerpts from the speeches of several representatives.

	With Red Heart and Courageous Spirit, Technology Can Be Fully Utilized

	Wang Huamin, Director of a Certain Medical Unit

	One day in May last year, two poor peasant community members carried a child who had his hand injured by a sickle to our medical unit. As soon as they entered, they earnestly said, "Please, comrades of the PLA, save 'Shitou' (the child's name) this hand!" When we unwrapped the wound covered with cloth, our hearts sank. The child's right palm was cut diagonally from the knuckle, with eight-ninths of the horizontal section severed. The bones and blood vessels of the second, third, fourth, and fifth fingers were all severed, and only the index and middle fingers were connected by a thin layer of skin and muscle. The entire palm hung down and turned dark purple. We had never treated such an injury before. At that moment, many thoughts arose: a few years ago, we heard that Shanghai successfully performed a hand reattachment surgery, but that was in a large hospital with good conditions. Our hospital is small and has poor equipment. Moreover, we have not received any advanced education; we are all medical assistants. Further thinking, if we proceed with the surgery, what if we fail? It could lead to infection, suppuration, and even necrosis, infecting the entire body, causing sepsis or septicemia. This would not only fail to save the child's hand but also put his life in danger. At this point, thoughts of fearing responsibility and evading responsibility emerged. However, looking at the poor and lower-middle-class brothers standing in front of us, they hoped so much that we could reattach the child's hand! Especially when I thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: "Serve the people wholeheartedly, never leave the masses; act in the interests of the people, not in the interests of individuals or small groups; be responsible to the people and to the Party's leadership—these are our starting points." And thinking of Comrade White's spirit of "selflessness and dedication to the people," I felt that this fleeting thought was unacceptable. It deviated from Chairman Mao's teachings and disappointed the people's expectations. At this point, I felt that the child's hand was not just the hand of a poor peasant's son and a working hand, but also the hand of a little red soldier of Chairman Mao, the hand of a successor to the proletarian revolutionary cause, a hand that would participate in the final struggle to bury imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries in the world. If we successfully reattach this hand, we add strength to the revolutionary cause and eliminate our own selfishness. Thus, I made up my mind to save the child's hand with all possible means; even if there is only one in a thousand or one in ten thousand chances, we must not give up.

	My resolve was also the resolve of all my colleagues in the unit. We mobilized and took an oath in front of Chairman Mao's portrait. After thorough preparation, we began the tense and complex surgery. We carefully handled every muscle and every piece of skin, not abandoning any living tissue, not cutting or snipping carelessly. After more than three hours of intense battle, we successfully completed the hand reattachment surgery.

	After the surgery, our hearts did not feel relaxed; instead, we were more tense. Because the success of the surgery still needed to be observed. The day after the surgery, in the afternoon, we found that the skin of the second, third, and fourth fingers gradually turned from purple to red and from cold to warm, showing signs of revival. However, the smallest finger turned from purple to black and felt cold. What should we do? We cannot let this little finger die and affect the entire life! At that time, I thought that a simple solution would be to just cut off this little finger. This way, the patient would be safe, and the doctor would be at ease. When I returned to the office with this thought, I looked up and saw Chairman Mao's portrait, and it seemed that Chairman Mao was reproaching me: "Have you fulfilled your duty as a people's doctor? Is this completely and thoroughly serving the people?" I immediately felt my face flush and my heart race, so I discussed with my colleagues again, following Chairman Mao's teachings of "overcoming all difficulties and striving for victory," taking all possible measures, and finally saving the child's little finger. On the eighth day after the surgery, when we unwrapped the child's hand dressing, the wound healed without infection or suppuration. The reattached palm and fingers had normal color and temperature. The severed palm was successfully reattached. Now, the child can use this hand freely for learning and labor.

	The counter-revolutionary revisionist Lu Ruiqing, in promoting the bourgeois reactionary military line, repeatedly advocated "skill makes the man bold." This is purely deceitful nonsense. Our conclusion is the opposite: a bold man is skilled.

	Arming people's minds with Mao Zedong Thought and transforming people's souls, we have a red heart that is completely and thoroughly dedicated to serving the people. With a red heart and courageous spirit, we can continuously improve our skills and fully utilize technology in practical struggles. Let Lu Ruiqing and his fallacies of "skill makes the man bold" go to hell!

### 赤胆红心为人民，技术才能发挥作用

    以毛泽东思想挂帅，搞好人的思想革命化，是政治中的政治，灵魂中的灵魂，核心中的核心。事实一再证明，在任何情况下都要首先抓政治，抓思想，抓活学活用毛主席著作。
    在沈阳部队最近召开的活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会上，许多先进单位代表和个人，介绍了他们坚持突出无产阶级政治，用毛泽东思想挂帅，搞好人的思想革命化的体会。这里刊登的是几位代表发言的摘要。

    赤胆红心为人民，技术才能发挥作用
    某部医疗所所长　王化民
    去年五月的一天，两个贫农社员抬着一个被铡伤手的小孩，到我们医疗所来。一进门就恳切地说：“请解放军同志千万千万救活‘石头’（小孩的名字）这只手吧！”当我们打开用布裹着的伤口一看，心里凉了半截。小孩右手掌由指关节处斜着铡断了横断面的九分之八，二、三、四、五指的骨头和血管都断离开了，只有食指和中指处还连着一点皮肤和一层薄薄的肌肉，整个前掌都耷拉下来，并呈现暗紫色。象这样的伤情，我们过去从没有治疗过。这时，产生了许多活思想：前几年听说上海做断手再植成功，但那是大医院，条件好，我们医院小，设备差。特别我们没有进什么高等学校“深造”过，都是干卫生员出身的。再往下想，要动手接，万一接不活，就会造成感染化脓，以致坏死，从而感染全身，引起菌血症、败血症。那样不但不能挽救小孩的手，连生命也有丧失的危险。想到这里，思想上闪出怕承担责任、推脱不管的念头。但是，看着站在自己面前的贫下中农阶级兄弟，他们是多么希望我们把小孩的手接上去啊！特别是当我想到毛主席的教导：“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众；一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发；向人民负责和向党的领导机关负责的一致性；这些就是我们的出发点。”想到白求恩同志“毫不利己专门利人”的共产主义精神，我感到自己这一闪念太不应该了，它背离了毛主席的教导，辜负了人民的期望。想到这里，就觉得小孩的手，不单是一个贫农儿子的手和一只劳动的手，而且是一个毛主席的红小兵的手，是无产阶级革命事业接班人的手，是一只将要参加在世界上最后埋葬帝、修、反的斗争的手。接活了这只手，就给革命事业增加一分力量，同时也挖掉我们自己一分私心。于是我下定决心，要尽一切可能抢救孩子的手；即使是千分之一的希望、万分之一的可能也绝不放过。
    我的决心也是我们全所同志的决心。我们在毛主席像前进行了动员、宣誓。经过认真准备，开始了紧张而又复杂的手术。我们对每条肌肉、每一小块皮肤都妥善处理，不放弃任何一点有生肌的组织，不随便动一刀、剪一剪。经过三个多小时的紧张战斗，终于顺利地做完了断掌再植手术。
    手术做完以后，我们的心情并没有轻松，反而更紧张了。因为手术是否成功，还有待观察。手术后的第二天下午，发现二、三、四指的皮肤，逐渐由紫变红，由凉变热，有了复活的希望；可是最小的那个手指却由紫变黑发凉。怎么办？可不能因为一个小指坏死，影响整个生命啊！当时我想，简便的处理办法，就是干脆把这个小指头割掉。这样做，病人安全，医生也放心。当我带着这个想法从病房回办公室的时候，抬头看到毛主席像，就觉得毛主席他老人家在责备我：“你尽到了一个人民医生的责任吗？你这是完全彻底为人民服务吗？”我顿时脸红心跳起来，于是，我又和同志们一起，按照毛主席“排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，采取一切可能的措施，终于把小孩的小手指也保存下来。手术后的第八天，打开小孩包手的敷料，伤口达到一期愈合，没有感染化脓，接上去的断掌连同手指的颜色和温度都很正常。断掌成功地被接活了。现在，孩子已经能用这只手自如地进行学习和劳动了。
    反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿，在推行资产阶级反动军事路线中，一再鼓吹“艺高人胆大”。这纯粹是骗人的鬼话。我们的结论正相反：胆大人艺高。
  用毛泽东思想武装人的头脑，改造人的灵魂，就有一颗“完全”“彻底”为人
  民服务的赤胆红心。赤胆红心为人民，
  才能在实践斗争中不断提高技术，充分
  发挥技术的作用。让罗瑞卿和他散布的
  “艺高人胆大”等等谬论一起见鬼去吧！
