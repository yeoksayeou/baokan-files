Under the warm care and wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, in the march towards the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, another piece of good news has arrived: the Anhui Provincial Revolutionary Committee has been born!

With hearts full of joy, we extend our highest respects and warmest congratulations to the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Anhui, the 35 million revolutionary people of Anhui, and the broad ranks of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Anhui!

The birth of the Anhui Provincial Revolutionary Committee is the result of the victory of the proletariat over the bourgeoisie, of the socialist road over the capitalist road, and of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line over the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie within the party. It is a great victory won by the revolutionary masses of the proletariat after repeated struggles against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party.

Chairman Mao has pointed out: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution waged by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the revolutionary masses under its leadership and the Kuomintang reactionaries. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.

Hidden within Anhui are a handful of diehard capitalist-roaders within the party, as well as traitors and spies, who are remnants of the already defeated Kuomintang reactionaries. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they refuse to accept their doom and are desperately struggling to the last. They either brutally suppress the revolutionary rebels of the proletariat, or spread rumors and lies, shoot poisoned arrows, and create trouble, or infiltrate and manipulate mass organizations, inciting the masses to fight against each other, fully exposing their ferocious, vicious, and cunning counter-revolutionary faces.

The proletarian headquarters, with Chairman Mao at the core and Vice Chairman Lin as his deputy, have shown great concern for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Anhui. At critical moments of struggle, Chairman Mao has always issued timely and wise instructions, pointing out the direction of the battle for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Anhui, guiding the heroic proletarian revolutionary masses of Jianghuai to fight bravely against the class enemies with unyielding heroism, smashing the evil plots of a handful of class enemies who attempted to restore capitalism in Anhui, and achieving decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Over the past year, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Anhui, like those throughout the country, have undergone great revolutionary tempering. We hope that all comrades of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat will, in the face of victory, further arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, enhance their proletarian revolutionary spirit. Here, we must point out: In class society, there is no such thing as abstract, classless factionalism. Therefore, Chairman Mao teaches us: Factionalism must be analyzed from a class perspective. The proletariat and the bourgeoisie are fundamentally opposed to each other. We must uphold the factionalism of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, that is, uphold the party spirit of the vanguard of the proletariat, that is, the revolutionary spirit of the left wing armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought; we must oppose the factionalism of right-opportunism, conservatism, pseudo-leftism that is right in essence, and all counter-revolutionary two-faced factionalism, that is, various manifestations of bourgeois factionalism within the revolutionary ranks. Only in this way can the revolutionary masses of the proletariat consolidate and develop the great alliance of revolution under the principle of revolution, distinguish between enemy and non-enemy contradictions and contradictions among the people, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

In the fierce struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Anhui have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasized proletarian politics, and steadfastly learned, propagated, executed, and defended the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao and the decisions of the Party Central Committee. They have supported the broad revolutionary masses of the left, and made great contributions to the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Anhui along the course charted by Chairman Mao.

We hope that the Anhui Provincial Revolutionary Committee, born in the storm of class struggle, will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry out thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticize and expose the traitor, scab, and renegade Khrushchev and his agents in Anhui, Li Baohua and Huang Yan and their ilk, and eliminate the poison they have spread in various aspects. To strike the class enemies more effectively, we must "study their strategies." At present, we must be particularly vigilant against and resolutely oppose right-wing splitism, right-wing capitulationism, and right-wing conservatism. We must strengthen our awareness of the enemy and heighten our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold to root out all hidden traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries.

The ship sails the sea with the helmsman, and the revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. To grow and strengthen itself in the stormy seas of class struggle, the Anhui Provincial Revolutionary Committee must follow the great strategic deployments of Chairman Mao and fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. It must put the revolutionary principle of being infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in the first place. This is being infinitely loyal to the Party and the people. It must further vigorously run Mao Zedong Thought study classes, actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought with problems from class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and constantly consolidate and develop the great alliance of revolution and the three-in-one combination on the principle of Mao Zedong Thought. It must love the army and the people, strengthen military-civilian unity, seize the revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness, focus on coal, steel, and grain production, improve water and land transportation, and strive for a double harvest of revolution and production.

We are deeply convinced that the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Anhui and the broad masses of soldiers and civilians, who have undergone the test of the storm of class struggle, will certainly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, redouble their efforts, strive to be in the forefront, remain humble and vigilant, and press ahead with renewed vigor, following the great helmsman Chairman Mao to break the waves and march towards the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    无产阶级革命派的胜利
    ——热烈祝贺安徽省革命委员会成立
    《人民日报》《解放军报》社论
    在我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀和英明领导下，在向无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的进军中，又传来一个新的喜讯：安徽省革命委员会诞生了！
    我们怀着十分喜悦的心情，向安徽省的无产阶级革命派，安徽三千五百万革命人民，以及人民解放军驻安徽部队广大指战员，致以崇高的敬意和热烈的祝贺！
    安徽省革命委员会的诞生，是无产阶级同资产阶级、社会主义道路同资本主义道路、毛主席的无产阶级革命路线同资产阶级反动路线进行胜利斗争的结果。是无产阶级革命派同党内一小撮走资派经过反复的较量后所取得的伟大胜利。
    毛主席指出：无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。
    隐藏在安徽的党内一小撮顽固不化的走资派，以及叛徒、特务，就是这样一些早已覆灭的国民党反动派的余孽。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他们不甘心于灭亡的命运，疯狂地进行垂死的挣扎。他们或者残酷镇压无产阶级革命造反派，或者散布流言蜚语，放毒箭，搞破坏，或者钻进并操纵群众组织，挑动群众斗群众，充分暴露其凶狠、恶毒、狡猾的反革命狰狞面目。
    以毛主席为首、以林副主席为副的无产阶级司令部，对安徽的无产阶级文化大革命非常关怀。在斗争的关键时刻，毛主席都及时作出了英明指示，指明了安徽无产阶级文化大革命的战斗航向，引导英雄的江淮无产阶级革命派以无畏的英雄气概，同阶级敌人进行了英勇的搏斗，粉碎了一小撮阶级敌人妄图在安徽复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋，取得了无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。
    一年多以来，安徽省的无产阶级革命派同全国无产阶级革命派一样，经受了很大的革命锻炼。我们希望，一切无产阶级革命派的同志，在胜利的形势下，要进一步用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，提高自己无产阶级的革命性。这里我们要提出：在阶级社会中，没有什么抽象的、超阶级的派性，所以，毛主席教导我们：对派性要进行阶级分析。无产阶级同资产阶级，就是根本对立的两大派。我们必须坚持无产阶级革命派的派性，即坚持无产阶级先锋队的党性，即用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的左派的革命性；我们必须反对右倾机会主义的、保守派的派性，形“左”而实右的极“左”派的派性，以及一切反革命两面派的派性，即资产阶级的派性在革命队伍内部的各种表现。只有这样，无产阶级革命派的人们才能在革命的原则下巩固发展革命的大联合，区别敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈搏斗中，人民解放军驻安徽部队广大指战员，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，坚定不移地学习、宣传、执行、捍卫伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示和党中央的决定，支持左派广大革命群众，为安徽无产阶级文化大革命沿着毛主席指引的航道胜利前进，立下了巨大的功绩。
    我们希望在阶级斗争暴风雨中诞生的安徽省革命委员会，要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，深入地持久地开展革命的大批判，把中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在安徽的代理人李葆华、黄岩之流，彻底批深批透，斗倒斗臭，肃清他们在各方面散布的流毒。为了更有力地打击阶级敌人，我们“必须研究他们的策略”。当前，要特别警惕和坚决反对右倾分裂主义，右倾投降主义，右倾保守主义。要加强敌情观念，百倍地提高革命警惕，把隐藏的叛徒、特务和反革命分子统统挖出来。
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。安徽省革命委员会要使自己在阶级斗争的大风大浪中成长壮大，率领全省无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，根本的一条就是要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的最新指示。要把无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的革命大节摆在首位。这就是无限忠于党，忠于人民。要进一步大力办好毛泽东思想学习班，带着阶级斗争和两条路线斗争中的问题活学活用毛泽东思想，在毛泽东思想原则基础上不断巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合。要拥军爱民，加强军民团结，抓革命，促生产，促工作，促战备，抓好煤炭、钢铁、粮食生产，搞好水陆交通运输，争取革命生产双丰收。
    我们深信，经历了阶级斗争暴风雨考验的安徽省无产阶级革命派和广大军民，一定会更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，鼓足干劲，力争上游，戒骄戒躁，再接再厉，紧跟伟大舵手毛主席破浪前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！
