The great leader Chairman Mao has profoundly pointed out: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a political revolution by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under socialist conditions. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and the revolutionary masses it leads, and the Kuomintang reactionaries. It is the continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.

The issuance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions has further inspired the revolutionary spirit of the broad masses of revolutionary rebels in our province. In the current acute and complex class struggle, they are more clear-sighted and spirited. We must actively respond to Chairman Mao's great battle call, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and firmly stand on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We must firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, launch a fierce and sustained attack on the class enemy, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

To respond to Chairman Mao's great battle call, we must deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism and struggle. We must thoroughly expose and criticize the counter-revolutionary crimes and the bourgeois reactionary line of the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev, and their agents in Hunan, such as Wang Yanchun. We must thoroughly purge the poison they have spread in various fields.

To respond to Chairman Mao's great battle call, we must resolutely and forcefully strike down the rightist reversal wind. We must raise the awareness of the broad masses in class struggle and line struggle. If the class enemy wants to reverse the verdict, we must give them a mass trial. If the class enemy wants to restore the old system, we must launch a mass counter-restoration. We must strike them down and keep them down, so they never rise again.

To respond to Chairman Mao's great battle call, we must strengthen our awareness of the enemy, keep our eyes open, and be good at identifying those who pretend to support the revolution but actually oppose it. We must thoroughly smash all their evil plots to shake and split the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao.

To respond to Chairman Mao's great battle call, we must seriously study the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly distinguishing between the two types of contradictions. We must be good at distinguishing between enemy and us contradictions and contradictions among the people. We must strike the enemy accurately, fiercely, and steadily. For our own people, for comrades who have made mistakes, whether they are revolutionary masses or revolutionary cadres, we must help them rectify their mistakes, learn from the past, and cure the sickness to save the patient.

To launch a fierce attack on the class enemy, we must resolutely oppose rightist conservatism. Without opposing rightist conservatism, we cannot firmly stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we cannot correctly distinguish between enemies, friends, and ourselves, and we will give the class enemy's rightist reversal and rightist split plots a chance to succeed. This would be a surrender to the class enemy. Therefore, closely combining with the actual class struggle at present, we must strive to learn and deeply understand Chairman Mao's latest instructions, resolutely oppose rightist conservatism. This is the key to winning this struggle against the enemy.

Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the revolutionary rebels immediately take action and launch a fierce attack on the class enemy! Fire! Fire!!

    加强敌情观念反对右倾翻案妖风
    伟大领袖毛主席深刻地指出：无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。
    毛主席最新指示的发表，更加激励了我省广大无产阶级革命派的革命斗志，在当前尖锐、复杂的阶级斗争中，更加心明眼亮，精神抖擞。我们一定要积极响应毛主席的伟大战斗号令，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚定不移地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，对准阶级敌人发动猛烈的持久的进攻，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    响应毛主席的伟大战斗号令，就要深入地持久地开展革命的大批判，把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在湖南的代理人王延春之流的反革命罪行和资产阶级反动路线，揭深揭透，批倒批臭，彻底肃清他们在各个领域中散布的流毒。
    响应毛主席的伟大战斗号令，就要坚决有力地迎头痛击右倾翻案的妖风。要提高广大群众阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟。阶级敌人要翻案，我们就要给他们来一个群众性的大定案。阶级敌人要复辟，我们就要来一个群众性的反复辟。把他们打翻在地，再踏上一只脚，叫他们永世不得翻身。
    响应毛主席的伟大战斗号令，就要加强敌情观念，擦亮眼睛，善于辨别那些伪装拥护革命而实际反对革命的分子，彻底粉碎他们动摇和分裂以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的一切罪恶阴谋。
    响应毛主席的伟大战斗号令，就要认真学习伟大领袖毛主席关于正确区分两类不同性质矛盾的教导，要善于区分敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾。对敌人要打得准，打得狠，打得稳。对自己人，对犯了错误的革命同志，不论是革命群众或者革命的领导干部，都要帮助他们整风，惩前毖后，治病救人。
    要向阶级敌人发动猛烈攻击，就必须坚决反对右倾保守主义。不反对右倾保守主义，就不可能坚定地站在毛主席的革命路线上，就不可能正确地区分敌、我、友，就会给阶级敌人的右倾翻案和右倾分裂的罪恶阴谋以得逞之机，就是向阶级敌人投降。因此，紧密结合当前阶级斗争的实际，努力学习和深刻领会毛主席的这一最新指示，坚决反对右倾保守主义，是能否取得这场对敌斗争胜利的关键。
    在毛主席最新指示的指引下，无产阶级革命派立即行动起来，向阶级敌人猛烈开火！开火！！
