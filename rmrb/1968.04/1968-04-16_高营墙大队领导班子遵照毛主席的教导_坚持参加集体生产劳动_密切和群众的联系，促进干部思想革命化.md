The leading cadre of Gaoyingqi Brigade in Zhangtaizi Commune, Liaoyang County, Liaoning Province, under the guidance of the People's Liberation Army propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought, has persisted in participating in collective production labor, carried forward the spirit of hard struggle, strengthened ties with the masses, and promoted the revolutionization of the leading cadre.

The leading cadre of Gaoyingqi Brigade has followed the instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, making the participation of cadres in collective production labor a fundamental and unshakable system. The eleven members of the leading cadre all actively participate in collective production labor. They divide responsibilities and work in teams, laboring during the day and handling work in the evening. Many cadres take on the heaviest tasks in work and the hardest labor. The head of the brigade, Meng Xianwu, often works and studies with the commune members, learning Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and engaging in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism. Recently, when the brigade was rushing to build an irrigation canal, he fearlessly led the way into the pit to pick up stones, despite the cold water and deep mud. When some commune members could not endure it, he recited Chairman Mao's teachings, "Resolutely carry out the decision, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," with the commune members, giving them the courage to overcome difficulties and speeding up the progress of the project. Accountant Hu Baichang, to participate in labor like other cadres, uses his evenings to handle accounts and guide the production team accountants. Poor and lower-middle-class commune members happily said, "Cadres participating in collective production labor can see the problems below, hear the voices of the masses, propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and do everything well. Revolution and production will definitely be successful!"

The leading cadre, to better and more frequently accept the supervision of the masses, has established help-the-cadre groups in each production team, consisting of poor and lower-middle-class members and militia. These groups regularly hold meetings to listen to criticisms and opinions from the masses. Cadres, with the attitude of being students of the masses, discuss matters more with the masses. New members of the leading cadre also follow Chairman Mao's instructions, maintaining the spirit of hard struggle. They advocate frugality for revolution, working in a simple office, using office supplies sparingly, and managing expenses meticulously. Member of the leading cadre Zhang Chengwen, who is over sixty years old, walks over sixty li to handle production team affairs without taking a car. The cadres say, "Spending one less fen can increase one fen of wealth for the collective, breaking one fen of 'self' in thought and increasing one fen of the proletariat's 'public'."

    新华社沈阳电　辽宁省辽阳县张台子公社高营墙大队的领导班子，在人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，坚持参加集体生产劳动，发扬艰苦奋斗作风，密切与群众的联系，促进了领导班子的革命化。
    高营墙大队领导班子遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，把坚持干部参加集体生产劳动做为一项雷打不动的根本制度来执行。领导班子的十一名成员，都积极参加集体生产劳动。他们分工包队，白天跟班劳动，晚间处理工作。许多干部对工作拣重担子挑，劳动抢重活干。领导班子的第一把手孟宪武经常同社员一起劳动，一起学习毛主席最新指示，一起斗私、批修。最近，大队突击修水渠，他不怕冷水刺骨，带头下井捞石头。水凉泥深，有的社员坚持不住了，他就和大家一起背诵毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，使社员们增加了战胜困难的勇气，加速了工程进度。会计胡百昌为了和其他干部同样参加劳动，尽量利用晚上业余时间整理账目和对生产队会计进行业务指导。贫下中农社员们高兴地说：“干部参加集体生产劳动，下边的问题能看到，群众的声音能听到，毛主席的最新指示能宣传到，样样工作能做到，革命、生产一定能搞好！”
    领导班子为了更好地、经常地接受群众的监督，他们在各生产队普遍建立了有贫下中农、民兵参加的帮助干部小组。这个小组定期召开会议，听取来自群众的批评和意见。干部们都本着做群众小学生的态度，遇事多和群众商量。新的领导班子成员还遵照毛主席的教导，保持艰苦奋斗作风。他们坚持节约闹革命，在一间简陋的办公室里办公，办公用品从俭，开支精打细算。领导班子成员张成文，今年六十多岁了，为生产队办事出门不坐车，徒步六十多华里。干部们说：“少花一分钱，就多为集体增加一分财富，思想上就破了一分‘私’字，增加了一分无产阶级的‘公’字。”
