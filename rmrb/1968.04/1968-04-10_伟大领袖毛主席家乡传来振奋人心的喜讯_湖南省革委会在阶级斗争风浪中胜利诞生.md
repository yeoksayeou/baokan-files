Joyous news from the hometown of our great leader Chairman Mao: The Hunan Provincial Revolutionary Committee triumphantly born amidst the storms of class struggle!

Three hundred thousand military personnel and civilians gathered in Changsha to hold a grand celebration meeting, enthusiastically shouting: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live ten thousand times!" They resolved to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to continue to deeply carry out the great revolutionary criticism, to firmly oppose rightist conservatism, rightist splitism, and rightist capitulationism, and to launch a proactive and sustained attack on the class enemy.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, April 9th: "The waves of Dongting Lake surge to the sky, and the people of Changsha sing and dance to the rhythm of the earth."

From the hometown of our beloved great leader Chairman Mao—Hunan, comes the exhilarating news: The Hunan Provincial Revolutionary Committee has been triumphantly born amidst the storms of class struggle! This is another great victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! This is another great victory for the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao!

The birth of the Hunan Provincial Revolutionary Committee is the brilliant achievement of the people of Hunan province following the strategic deployment of our great leader Chairman Mao, further implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions!

Our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao have always shown great concern for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Hunan, issuing many important instructions. At the critical moment of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, Chairman Mao, during his inspections of North China, Central China, and East China, also visited Hunan. Chairman Mao's warm concern and a series of extremely important latest instructions are the greatest encouragement, the greatest education, and the greatest spur for the revolutionary people of Hunan Province. With boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, they hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and march forward bravely, achieving one victory after another.

On April 8th, a grand gathering of three hundred thousand people was held in Changsha, the capital of Hunan Province, to celebrate the triumphant birth of the Hunan Provincial Revolutionary Committee. That day, Changsha was radiant, and everywhere was a festive scene. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, Red Guards, and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army carried the giant portrait of Chairman Mao, held the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," sang "The East is Red," and beat drums and gongs, surging towards Dongfeng Square from all directions.

The celebration meeting began to the majestic tune of "The East is Red." When the meeting solemnly announced the glorious birth of the Hunan Provincial Revolutionary Committee, the entire venue thundered with applause, and the masses rejoiced. Tens of thousands of people repeatedly raised their arms and shouted: "Long live the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao! Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China! Long live our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live ten thousand times!"

On this grand day of celebrating the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, the 38 million heroic sons and daughters of Chairman Mao's hometown, with their profound proletarian feelings of boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty towards Chairman Mao, sincerely wish our red sun, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life!

The establishment of the Hunan Provincial Revolutionary Committee declares the complete failure of the evil plot by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev, and their agents in Hunan to restore capitalism. Over the past decade or so since liberation, the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines in Hunan Province has been extremely sharp and complex. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev, colluded with their agents in Hunan such as Wang Yanchun, conspired with the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries, forming a counter-revolutionary triad, and pushed the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in all aspects and on all fronts, attempting to restore capitalism in Hunan, committing heinous crimes. The people of Hunan, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, have always been engaged in a heroic and tenacious struggle against them. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the glorious revolutionary tradition and the strong fighting force of the proletariat in Hunan, the broad revolutionary masses, and the Red Guards formed a vast revolutionary army, vowing to defend Chairman Mao, defend Mao Zedong Thought, defend the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, and launched a fierce general offensive against China's Khrushchev and his agents in Hunan. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses, holding high the invincible great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fought bravely and unyieldingly, defeating the enemy of the proletariat from the right and the ultra-"left" in their repeated frenzied counterattacks, smashing the counter-revolutionary restoration plan of a handful of counter-revolutionaries, and seizing back the power usurped by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, such as Wang Yanchun, from the hands of the revolutionary cadres, achieving a decisive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Hunan Province.

"No army, no people's everything." In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Hunan responded enthusiastically to the great call of the great commander Chairman Mao, standing firmly on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao at the critical moment of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, fully supporting the revolutionary cadres, adhering to the principle of "supporting the left but not the factions," using the great Mao Zedong Thought to propagate, organize, and arm the masses, making Chairman Mao's latest instructions take root in the minds of the masses and be implemented in the actions of the masses, making great contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Hunan.

Comrade Li Yuan, the chairman of the Hunan Provincial Revolutionary Committee, spoke at the celebration meeting, reviewing the great fighting course of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Hunan Province over the past year. He said: Currently, the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Hunan Province is better than ever. All the victories we have achieved are the great victories of the wise leadership of the great commander Chairman Mao, and the great victories of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, the most fundamental task is to uphold Mao Zedong Thought, adhere to Mao Zedong Thought in all fields, strengthen the education of Mao Zedong Thought, and achieve the thought revolutionization of the people.

Comrade Li Yuan emphasized that we must never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, firmly oppose rightist conservatism, rightist splitism, and rightist capitulationism, carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, grasp the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, and launch a proactive and sustained attack on the class enemy. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, continue to carry out the great revolutionary criticism, thoroughly expose and criticize China's Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and their agents in Hunan politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and cleanse the revisionist poison they spread in various fields. We will not stop until we achieve complete victory. We must fully expose the sabotage activities of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, rightists, and the remnants of the Kuomintang.

Comrade Li Yuan said that the revolutionary people of the entire province should carry out the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought more extensively and deeply, continue to run Mao Zedong Thought study classes well, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, combine the great revolutionary criticism with the struggle, criticism, and transformation of one's own unit, reform education, reform literature and art, reform office work and administrative management work, reform all superstructures that do not conform to the socialist economic base, firmly implement Chairman Mao's policy on cadres, help more revolutionary cadres stand up, further consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary triad, firmly rely on the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, and thoroughly carry out the cultural revolution in the countryside. We must firmly implement the proletarian line of building the Party of Chairman Mao, rectify the Party organization, and strengthen Party building. We must enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's great call of "supporting the army and loving the people," strengthen military-civilian unity. We must firmly implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness" and "save money to make revolution." He said that the revolutionary people of the entire province should hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, follow the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, advance victoriously, and seize the overall victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in terms of thought, politics, economy, and organization.

Comrade Long Shujin, the first deputy chairman of the Hunan Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the commander of the Hunan Provincial Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, also spoke at the celebration meeting. He reviewed the profound education he received in the struggle between the two lines over the past year or so in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and felt even more that Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is extremely wise and great. He expressed his determination to forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution and forever be loyal to the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao. He said that we must remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "The imperialists and their running dogs, the Chinese reactionaries, will not be reconciled to their defeat in China." China's Khrushchev and his handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, such as Wang Yanchun, are not reconciled to their defeat in Hunan and are still attempting to negate the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and negate the revolutionary mass movement. We must firmly oppose rightist conservatism, rightist splitism, and rightist capitulationism, thoroughly smash the capitalist restoration plot, and defend Chairman Mao, defend Vice Chairman Lin, defend the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao, defend the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and seize the overall victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Comrade Hua Guofeng, deputy chairman of the Hunan Provincial Revolutionary Committee and revolutionary leading cadre, Comrade Yang Dayi, responsible person of the Hunan Provincial Military Region of the People's Liberation Army and deputy chairman of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee, also spoke at the meeting.

Representatives of the revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and Red Guards of Hunan Province also spoke at the meeting one after another. They unanimously expressed their firm support and maintenance of the newly born Hunan Provincial Revolutionary Committee. They unanimously expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They will take "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the key, overthrow the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchist reactionary trends, enhance proletarian party spirit, strengthen proletarian organizational discipline, further consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance, continue to carry out the great revolutionary criticism, do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their own units, firmly support and assist the People's Liberation Army in doing a good job in the "three supports and two militaries" work, and seize the overall victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, turning Chairman Mao's hometown Hunan Province into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

Comrade Chen Fahong, responsible person of the Guangzhou Military Region, also warmly congratulated the establishment of the Hunan Provincial Revolutionary Committee at the celebration meeting.

Amidst the enthusiastic and endless cheers and applause of the entire venue, the meeting passed a telegram of respect to our red sun, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao.

Those who attended the celebration meeting also included deputy chairmen of the Hunan Provincial Revolutionary Committee Zhang Bosen, Liu Shunwen, Hu Yong, and Ye Weidong, deputy chairman of the Changsha Municipal Revolutionary Committee Sun Yunying, as well as members of the provincial and municipal revolutionary committees. Responsible persons of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Hunan and various military academies also attended the celebration meeting.

    湖南省革命委员会的成立，宣告了中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派以及他们在湖南的代理人妄图复辟资本主义罪恶阴谋的彻底破产。解放十几年来，湖南省两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，一直十分尖锐复杂。以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资派，串通他们在湖南的代理人王延春之流，勾结国民党反动派的残渣余孽，结成反革命三结合，在各个方面、各条战线推行反革命修正主义路线，妄图在湖南复辟资本主义，犯下了滔天罪行。用毛泽东思想哺育成长的湖南人民，始终同他们进行着英勇顽强的斗争。在无产阶级文化大革命中，具有光荣革命传统和坚强战斗力的湖南工人阶级，广大革命群众和红卫兵小将，组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，誓死保卫毛主席，保卫毛泽东思想，保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在湖南的代理人发动了猛烈的总攻击。广大无产阶级革命派、革命群众高举战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，英勇奋战，百折不挠，打败了无产阶级的敌人从右的方面和极“左”方面一次又一次的疯狂反扑，粉碎了少数反革命分子妄图颠覆无产阶级专政的反革命复辟计划，把中国赫鲁晓夫在湖南的代理人王延春等党内一小撮走资派所窃取的权力夺回到无产阶级革命派手中，取得了湖南省无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。
      “没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”在无产阶级文化大革命中，中国人民解放军驻湖南部队广大指战员，热烈响应伟大统帅毛主席的伟大号召，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的关键时刻，坚决站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，全力支持无产阶级革命派，坚持支左不支派的原则，用伟大的毛泽东思想宣传群众，组织群众，武装群众，使毛主席的最新指示扎根到群众思想中，落实到群众行动上，为湖南无产阶级文化大革命立下了巨大的功勋。
    湖南省革命委员会主任黎原同志在庆祝大会上讲话，回顾了一年多来湖南省无产阶级文化大革命的伟大战斗历程。他说：目前，湖南省无产阶级文化大革命形势空前大好，越来越好。我们取得的一切胜利，都是伟大统帅毛主席英明领导的伟大胜利，都是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。革命委员会成立以后，最根本的任务就是大立毛泽东思想，坚持在一切领域中用毛泽东思想挂帅，大力加强毛泽东思想的教育，实现人的思想革命化。
    黎原同志强调地说，我们一定要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，坚定地反对右倾保守主义、右倾分裂主义和右倾投降主义，发扬无产阶级的彻底革命精神，狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，向阶级敌人发起主动的持久的进攻。我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，继续深入开展革命大批判，把中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在湖南的代理人，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底揭深揭透，批倒批臭，肃清他们在各个领域中散布的修正主义毒素，不获全胜，决不收兵。要充分揭露叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派及地、富、反、坏、右和国民党残余势力的破坏活动。
