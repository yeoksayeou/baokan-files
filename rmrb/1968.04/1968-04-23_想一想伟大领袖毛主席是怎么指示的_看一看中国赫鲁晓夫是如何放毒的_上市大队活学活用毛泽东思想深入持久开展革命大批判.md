Shangshi Brigade in Shangshi Commune, Hejin County, Shanxi Province, has been deeply and persistently carrying out revolutionary criticism in accordance with Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle." Using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, they have been thoroughly purging the counter-revolutionary revisionist poison of the Chinese Khrushchev from all aspects, significantly raising the awareness of class struggle and line struggle among the broad masses of commune members.

One of the experiences of Shangshi Brigade in deeply and persistently carrying out revolutionary criticism is to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to raise the awareness of the broad cadres and masses about revolutionary criticism. They have formed a vast revolutionary army, using various forms to launch a people's war against the counter-revolutionary revisionism of the Chinese Khrushchev. In the past, some cadres in this brigade thought that the revisionist goods advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev, such as "four freedoms," "three selfs and one package," and "material incentives," had been executed and spread to some extent by themselves, fearing that criticism would implicate themselves and dared not boldly organize the broad masses of commune members to carry out criticism. Facing these situations, the brigade leadership organized cadres to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's quotations on revolutionary criticism and the "Three Old Articles," and conducted reminiscence and bitterness-removal education. After raising the cadres' awareness, they all actively led the way in exposing and criticizing. The entire brigade established a revolutionary criticism leadership group, with twelve members dividing tasks to go deep into six production teams, and each team also established a revolutionary criticism leadership small group. They also followed Chairman Mao's teaching that "revolutionary war is the war of the masses, only by mobilizing the masses can the war be conducted, only by relying on the masses can the war be conducted," and through reminiscence and bitterness-removal class education, broadly mobilized the masses to join the fight against the Chinese Khrushchev. Now, almost all the revolutionary masses in the entire brigade, young and old, men and women, have joined the revolutionary criticism tide.

The practice of Shangshi Brigade also proves that carrying out thematic criticism in a planned and step-by-step manner is an effective way to deepen and thoroughly carry out criticism. Chairman Mao teaches us: "In warfare, battles must be fought one by one, and enemies must be eliminated one part at a time." Shangshi Brigade has realized that the Chinese Khrushchev's poison in rural areas is extensive, and to thoroughly purge his poison, it is necessary to criticize and expose one problem at a time. Revolutionary criticism is a long-term combat mission, and in general, it should be a protracted war, while in specific problems, it should be a battle of annihilation. They categorized and summarized the large amount of materials exposed by the masses into issues such as "exploitation is meritorious," "theory of extinguishing class struggle," "three selfs and one package," "four freedoms," "material incentives," "work points as the criterion," and "heavy rewards and punishments," and carried out thematic criticism in a planned and step-by-step manner, with remarkable effects. Many commune members said: "Three selfs and one package" is a big poison of revisionism, harming the country, the collective, and the commune members. It lures us away from the socialist path indicated by Chairman Mao and leads us onto the capitalist wrong path. We firmly oppose it! In criticizing the revisionist poisons of "material incentives" and "heavy rewards and punishments," everyone cleared up the revisionist poisons in management and operation. In the past, this brigade was influenced by "material incentives" and once transferred some livestock for separate feeding, setting up many revisionist reward methods. Some people became more selfish with more rewards, but the livestock became thinner. Through revolutionary criticism, commune members realized that the Chinese Khrushchev wanted to "intoxicate" us with bonuses and then drag us onto the black path of revisionism, and all expressed firm opposition.

Another experience of Shangshi Brigade is to closely combine revolutionary criticism with the current revolutionary and production struggles, to thoroughly criticize and establish new things, and to criticize and change simultaneously. Before the spring plowing, they criticized the revisionist poisons of "material incentives" and "work points as the criterion" again. Commune members had a deeper understanding that focusing on work points and not on the quality of farm work is capitalist thinking, thus raising their awareness of ensuring the quality of farm work. They also broke with the old and established the new, setting up a political scoring system that highlights Mao Zedong Thought in the style of Dazhai.

The most fundamental experience of Shangshi Brigade in continuously and deeply carrying out revolutionary criticism is to use Mao Zedong Thought as the banner, closely combining the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works with the criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev. They studied and applied Chairman Mao's works with living thoughts and problems in criticism and revolutionary and production struggles. For every thematic criticism, they first studied Chairman Mao's related quotations. They thought about how Chairman Mao instructed, saw how the Chinese Khrushchev spread poison, and thought about how the local area and themselves had done in the past. They studied and applied in the struggle, and the effects were immediate. In this way, they had a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's great teachings, a clearer recognition of the poisons of capitalism and revisionism, raised their awareness of class struggle and line struggle, and strongly promoted the revolutionization of thought.

    想一想伟大领袖毛主席是怎么指示的
    看一看中国赫鲁晓夫是如何放毒的
    上市大队活学活用毛泽东思想深入持久开展革命大批判
    据新华社太原二十一日电　山西省河津县柴家公社上市大队广大社员遵照毛主席
  “千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，深入持久地开展革命大批判，从各个方面肃清中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义流毒，使广大社员的阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟有了很大提高。
    上市大队持久深入地开展革命大批判的经验之一是，以毛泽东思想为武器，提高广大干部和社员群众对革命大批判的认识，组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，运用各种形式，发动一场围剿中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义的
  “人民战争”。过去，这个大队有些干部认为，中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“四大自由”、“三自一包”、“物质刺激”等修正主义货色，自己或多或少都执行和传播过，怕批判起来会牵连到自己，不敢大胆地组织广大社员搞大批判。针对这些情况，大队领导班子就组织干部反复学习毛主席有关革命大批判的语录和“老三篇”，进行忆苦思甜教育。干部们的认识提高后，都主动地带头揭，带头批。全大队成立了大批判领导组，十二名领导成员分工深入六个生产队，每个队也都成立了大批判领导小组。他们还遵照毛主席的“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争”的教导，通过忆苦思甜的阶级教育，广泛发动群众都来围剿中国赫鲁晓夫。现在全大队男女老少，几乎所有的革命群众都投入了革命大批判的洪流。
    上市大队的实践还证明，有计划、有步骤地搞专题批判，是把大批判搞深搞透的有效办法。毛主席教导我们：“打仗只能一仗一仗地打，敌人只能一部分一部分地消灭。”上市大队体会到，中国赫鲁晓夫在农村的流毒很多，要彻底肃清其流毒必须一个问题一个问题地批深批透。革命大批判是一项长期的战斗任务，在总体上要打持久战，在具体问题上要打歼灭战。他们把群众揭发的大量材料，分类归纳为“剥削有功”、“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“物质刺激”、“工分挂帅”、“重奖重罚”等问题，有计划有步骤地进行专题批判，收效非常显著。许多社员说：“三自一包”是修正主义大毒药，一害国家，二害集体，三害社员，它引诱我们离开毛主席指引的社会主义道路，往资本主义的邪路上走，咱们坚决不答应！在批判“物质刺激”、“重奖重罚”这些修正主义流毒时，大家清算了在经营管理等方面的修正主义流毒。过去这个大队受到“物质刺激”的影响，曾经一度下放一些牲口，分槽饲养，规定了很多修正主义的奖励办法。有些人越得奖私心越重，牲口却越喂越瘦。通过革命大批判，社员们认识到，这是中国赫鲁晓夫想把咱们用奖金“灌醉”，然后往修正主义的黑路上拉，都表示坚决反对。
    上市大队的另一条经验是，革命大批判要同当前的革命和生产斗争紧紧地结合起来，大破大立，边批边改。春耕开始前，他们对“物质刺激”、“工分挂帅”等修正主义流毒再一次作了批判，社员们更深刻地认识到光顾工分，不讲农活质量，是资本主义思想，从而提高了保证农活质量的自觉性。他们还破旧立新，建立了大寨式的突出毛泽东思想的政治评分制。
    上市大队的革命大批判持续开展、越搞越深的最根本的经验，就是用毛泽东思想挂帅，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动同对中国赫鲁晓夫的大批判紧密结合起来。他们带着大批判中的问题和革命、生产斗争中的活思想，活学活用毛主席著作，每批判什么专题，就先学习毛主席的有关语录。想一想毛主席是怎么指示的，看一看中国赫鲁晓夫是如何放毒的，想一想本地和自己过去是怎样做的。他们在斗争中学，在斗争中用，活学活用，立竿见影。这样，对毛主席的伟大教导理解得更深，对资本主义、修正主义流毒认识得更清，提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，有力地促进了思想革命化。
