The nature of imperialism is plunder.

According to a recent announcement by the U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. investment in Latin America in 1967 reached over $1.4 billion, an increase of approximately $400 million compared to 1965. This is a confession by U.S. monopoly capital of its intensified exploitation of the Latin American people.

In addition to large-scale capital exports to Latin America, U.S. imperialism also engages in unequal trade through buying low and selling high, seizing large tracts of "leased land," and other means to ruthlessly squeeze the blood and sweat of the Latin American people, plunder Latin American resources, and reap huge profits. Numerous shocking facts repeatedly prove that U.S. imperialism is the most vicious bloodsucker, the root cause of countless disasters for the Latin American people.

The nature of imperialism is plunder. Whether it implements a policy of war or a policy of "peace," it is all for the sake of plunder. In Latin America, U.S. imperialism plays a deceitful trick, with so-called "economic aid," "Pan-Americanism," "Alliance for Progress," and other terms, which are all just euphemisms for "plunder."

The more U.S. imperialism sinks into an insoluble crisis, the more frantically it will engage in external aggression. Despite the fact that U.S. imperialism's aggression and expansion worldwide have caused serious consequences for its finances and monetary system, despite the fact that the U.S. international balance of payments is in a huge deficit and the dollar crisis is becoming more severe, U.S. monopoly capital still carries out large-scale capital exports. Especially in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the U.S. government not only does not impose restrictions but also encourages it. This fully illustrates that as long as U.S. imperialism exists for one more day, it will not stop aggression and plunder until it enters the grave.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "Imperialism has prepared the conditions for its own destruction. The awakening of the masses of the people in the colonies and semi-colonies and the masses of the people within the imperialist countries themselves is such a condition. Imperialism drives the masses of the people of the whole world to the great struggle to eliminate imperialism in the historical era."

The ruthless exploitation and plunder of the Latin American people by U.S. imperialism ultimately serve to create its own gravediggers. The Latin American people and all oppressed nations and peoples of the world, through their own personal experiences, further recognize that U.S. imperialism is their most vicious enemy. The people of the world unite, rise up, and attack it together, and this beast, U.S. imperialism, will definitely hasten its own demise.

### 帝国主义的本性就是掠夺

    帝国主义的本性就是掠夺
    据美国商务部最近宣布，一九六七年美国对拉丁美洲的新投资达十四亿多美元，比一九六五年增加了约四亿美元。这是美国垄断资本加紧剥削拉丁美洲人民的一份自供状。
    美帝国主义除了对拉丁美洲实行大规模的资本输出，还通过贱买贵卖的不平等贸易、霸占大片“租让地”等方式，疯狂地榨取拉丁美洲人民的血汗，掠夺拉丁美洲的资源，获取高额的利润。大量惊人的事实一再证明，美帝国主义是最凶恶的吸血鬼，是拉丁美洲人民无数灾难的总根源。
    帝国主义的本性就是掠夺。它所实行的战争政策也好，“和平”政策也好，都是为了掠夺。美帝国主义在拉丁美洲玩弄一套骗人的把戏，什么“经济援助”，什么“泛美主义”，什么“争取进步联盟”，其实都不过是“掠夺”二字的代名词罢了。
    美帝国主义越是陷入不可解脱的危机之中，就越要疯狂地进行对外侵略。尽管美帝国主义在全世界的侵略和扩张已经对它的财政金融造成严重后果，尽管美国的国际收支的亏空巨大，美元危机越来越严重，美国垄断资本仍然要实行大量的资本输出。特别是对亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲地区的投资，美国政府不但不加限制，而且还予以鼓励。这充分说明，美帝国主义只要生存一天，它就一天不会停止侵略和掠夺，直到进入坟墓。
    我们伟大的导师毛主席指出：“帝国主义给自己准备了灭亡的条件。殖民地半殖民地的人民大众和帝国主义自己国家内的人民大众的觉悟，就是这样的条件。帝国主义驱使全世界的人民大众走上消灭帝国主义的伟大斗争的历史时代。”
    美帝国主义对拉丁美洲人民的残酷剥削和掠夺，归根结底，起着制造它自己的掘墓人的作用。拉丁美洲人民和世界上一切被压迫民族、被压迫人民，从自己的切身体验中进一步认清了美帝国主义是他们的最凶恶的敌人。全世界人民团结起来，群起而攻之，美帝国主义这只野兽就一定会加速走向灭亡。
