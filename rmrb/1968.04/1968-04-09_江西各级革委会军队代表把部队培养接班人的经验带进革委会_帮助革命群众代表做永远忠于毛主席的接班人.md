People's Liberation Army representatives participating in various levels of revolutionary committees in Jiangxi have brought the experience of cultivating successors to the revolutionary cause of the proletariat from the military into the revolutionary committees. They are wholeheartedly helping revolutionary mass representatives to study and apply Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts, strengthen the mass line, and cultivate the style of maintaining close ties with the masses, becoming faithful successors to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary cause.

In Jiangxi, a large number of revolutionary pioneers who emerged from the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have joined various levels of revolutionary committees. Military representatives participating in various revolutionary leading cadres regard helping these mass representatives to study and apply Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts and actively conducting revolutionary tradition education for them as their important tasks. After the establishment of the Rujin County Revolutionary Committee, military representatives in the committee conducted traditional education for the committee members. They led the members of the Rujin County Revolutionary Committee to walk to Sha Zhou Bay, where Chairman Mao had once worked in a field, to receive education on Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice. They resolved to cultivate the committee members into a new generation who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Nanchang City Revolutionary Committee Standing Committee member and commander of a certain unit, Xu Lianfa, regards helping mass representatives to achieve ideological revolutionization as his duty. He studies with them Chairman Mao's theories, lines, principles, and policies on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Together, they visit the "Model Squad for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" and the exhibition on the heroic deeds of "Model for Supporting the Left and Loving the People" Li Wenzhong, educating them to be like the hero Li Wenzhong, "Loving what Chairman Mao loves, supporting what Chairman Mao supports, following Chairman Mao's instructions, and advancing when Chairman Mao waves his hand."

With a high sense of revolutionary responsibility, military representatives help mass representatives to always adhere to the mass line, never detach from the masses, and establish a flesh-and-blood relationship with the masses, always maintaining the character of the working people. Liu Jinghui, deputy director of the Fuzhou Region Revolutionary Committee and political commissar of a certain unit, and Liu Meigui, deputy director of the revolutionary committee and a young revolutionary, used to fight side by side and forged a deep revolutionary friendship. Now, they are both part of the revolutionary committee, working for the proletariat to seize power. Once, during a meeting, Liu Meigui did not wait for a comrade to finish speaking before eagerly expressing his own opinion, which led to a dispute. This incident caught Liu Jinghui's attention. After the meeting, he had a heart-to-heart talk with Liu Meigui, seriously pointing out to him that not allowing a comrade to finish speaking is a sign of poor democratic style. He then studied with him Chairman Mao's discussions on democratic centralism and patiently helped him using the army's democratic tradition. He said, "Whether it is old cadres or new cadres, can they discuss matters with the masses, be humble students of the masses, always maintain the character of the working people, and diligently serve the people? This is a big issue related to whether our socialist mountains will change color and whether the proletarian dictatorship can be consolidated." Afterward, Liu Meigui actively sought out the old comrade, humbly examined his own shortcomings, and patiently sought his opinions. Under the influence and encouragement of Liu Jinghui, the young revolutionary Liu Meigui often went deep into the masses to understand the situation. Even when some masses fell ill, he would find time to visit them in the hospital despite his busy work. The masses were moved and said, "Cadres are not only our leaders but also our confidants."

Chairman Mao teaches us, "The reform of state organs, the most fundamental point, is to connect with the masses." Soon after the establishment of the Jiangxi Normal University Revolutionary Committee, some leading members spent too much time in the office and too little time among the masses, and they discussed matters with the masses less often. Military representatives seized this issue, organizing them to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings on "being both an 'official' and a common person," making them realize that not trusting the masses, not relying on the masses, and neglecting the people is disloyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. From then on, mass representatives regarded connecting with the masses as an important aspect of their own revolutionization, always learning from the masses, humbly being students of the masses, and greatly strengthening their relationship with the masses.

    江西各级革委会军队代表把部队培养接班人的经验带进革委会
    帮助革命群众代表做永远忠于毛主席的接班人
    新华社南昌八日电　参加江西各级革命委员会的人民解放军代表把部队培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的经验带进革命委员会，满腔热情地帮助革命群众代表活学活用毛泽东思想，增强群众观点，树立密切联系群众的作风，做永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    在江西，有大批从无产阶级文化大革命中涌现出来的革命闯将参加了各级革命委员会。参加各级革命领导班子的部队代表，把帮助这些革命群众代表活学活用毛泽东思想，积极向他们进行革命传统教育，作为自己的重要任务。瑞金县革命委员会成立后，革委会中的军队代表就对革委会的成员进行传统教育。他们带领县革命委员会成员步行到沙洲坝，在毛主席当年劳动过的一块田里，进行了毛主席伟大革命实践的教育。他们决心把革委会的成员培养成无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的一代新人。南昌市革命委员会常委、某部部队长许连法，把帮助革命群众代表实现思想革命化当作自己应尽的职责，并同他们一起学习毛主席关于无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，同他们一起参观“支左爱民模范排”和“支左爱民模范”李文忠英雄事迹展览，教育他们象英雄李文忠那样，“毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进。”
    军队代表怀着高度的革命责任感，帮助革命群众代表永远坚持群众路线，一刻也不脱离群众，和群众建立血肉相连的关系，永远保持劳动人民的本色。抚州地区革命委员会副主任、某部政治委员刘景淮和革委会副主任、革命小将刘美贵，过去并肩战斗，结下了深厚的革命友谊，如今，他们又都参加了革委会，为无产阶级掌权。有一次开会，刘美贵未等一个同志把话讲完，就急于发表自己的意见，引起了争执。这事引起了刘景淮的注意。会后，他就找刘美贵谈心，严肃地向他指出，不让同志把话讲完，是民主作风不好的表现。接着，就和他一起学习毛主席有关民主集中制的论述，并用部队的民主传统对他进行了耐心的帮助。他说：“无论是老干部还是新干部，能不能遇事和群众商量，甘当群众的小学生，永远保持劳动人民的本色，勤勤恳恳地为人民服务，这是关系到我们社会主义江山会不会变色，无产阶级政权能不能巩固的大问题。”事后，刘美贵主动找那个老同志，虚心检查了自己的缺点，又耐心征求了他对自己的意见。革命小将刘美贵在刘景淮的影响和带动下，经常深入群众，了解情况。有的群众生了病，他工作再忙，也要抽空到医院去探望。群众感动地说：“干部既是我们的带头人，也是我们的知心人。”
    毛主席教导我们：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”江西师范学院革命委员会成立不久，有部分领导成员蹲办公室多了，深入群众少了，遇事和群众商量少了。军队代表就抓住这个问题，组织他们反复学习毛主席“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的教导，使他们认识到：不相信群众，不依靠群众，忽视了人民群众，就是对毛主席无产阶级革命路线的不忠。从此以后，革命群众代表把联系群众作为自身革命化的重要方面，处处拜群众为师，甘当群众的小学生，大大密切了同群众的关系。
