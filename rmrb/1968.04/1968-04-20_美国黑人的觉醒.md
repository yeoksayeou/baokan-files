Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out as early as 1963: "The American blacks are awakening, and their resistance is growing stronger. In recent years, the mass struggle of American blacks against racial discrimination and for freedom and equal rights has been developing day by day." Now, the fact that American blacks are fearlessly rising up and launching a surging wave of anti-violence struggles fully proves Chairman Mao's scientific foresight.

American blacks have been waging a heroic struggle against racial oppression and for freedom and liberation, demonstrating the awakening of American blacks and the immense revolutionary power they possess.

In an attempt to save its doomed fate, American imperialism has been carrying out fascist suppression against the anti-violence struggles of American blacks. This not only reveals its extreme viciousness but also fully exposes its paper tiger's weak essence. Such brutal suppression will never intimidate the brave black brothers; instead, it will further promote their awakening, strengthen their fighting will and confidence in victory, and arouse them to wage broader and more intense struggles, accelerating the downfall of American imperialism.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "The evil system of colonialism and imperialism, which is based on the enslavement and trafficking of blacks, will also come to an end with the complete liberation of the black race."

We firmly believe that as long as American blacks are determined, fear no sacrifice, and fight on relentlessly, and combine their struggle with the struggle of the American people against the reactionary ruling clique of American monopoly capitalists, they will, with the strong support of the revolutionary people of the whole world, surely burn the paper tiger of American imperialism, which appears to be powerful, to ashes!

    美国黑人的觉醒
    海军航空兵机关无产阶级革命派
    我们的伟大统帅毛主席早在一九六三年就曾英明地指出：“美国黑人正在觉醒，他们的反抗日益强烈。近几年来，美国黑人反对种族歧视、争取自由和平等权利的群众性斗争，有日益发展的趋势。”现在，美国黑人不畏强暴，掀起汹涌澎湃的抗暴斗争浪潮的事实，充分证明了毛主席的科学预见。
    美国黑人为了反对种族压迫、争取自由和解放进行了英勇的斗争，显示了美国黑人的觉醒和他们中间蕴藏着无比强大的革命力量。
    美帝国主义为了挽救即将灭亡的命运，对美国黑人的抗暴斗争进行了法西斯的镇压，不仅表明了它的穷凶极恶，而且再次充分暴露了它的纸老虎的虚弱本质。这种残酷的镇压，决不能吓倒英勇斗争的黑人兄弟，只能进一步促进他们的觉醒，增强他们的斗争意志和胜利信心，激起他们更广泛、更激烈的斗争，加速美帝国主义的灭亡。
    毛主席指出：“万恶的殖民主义、帝国主义制度是随着奴役和贩卖黑人而兴盛起来的，它也必将随着黑色人种的彻底解放而告终。”
    我们坚信，只要美国黑人下定决心，不怕牺牲，前赴后继，并且与美国人民反对美国垄断资产阶级反动统治集团的整个斗争结合起来，坚持斗争，那末，他们在全世界革命人民的大力支持下，一定能把美帝国主义这头貌似强大的纸老虎烧成灰烬！
