Latin American friends warmly hail Chairman Mao's great statement. Latin American people unite to support the struggles of peoples of all countries. United in hatred, we will annihilate our common enemy, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.

HAVANA, April 25 (Xinhua) — Some Latin American friends warmly hail Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence. They pointed out that Chairman Mao's statement is not only a great support and encouragement to the American blacks but also a great support and encouragement to the anti-U.S. struggles of the peoples of the world.

A Uruguayan friend said: "Chairman Mao's statement is a great support and encouragement to the struggles of the peoples of all countries against U.S. imperialism and to the struggle of the Vietnamese people against U.S. imperialism. As a Latin American, I can say that the struggle of the American blacks is our own struggle, because we have a common goal that unites us. The American blacks use revolutionary violence to resist counter-revolutionary violence, which greatly encourages us."

This Uruguayan friend went on to say: The struggle of the American blacks is not isolated. He said: "We Latin Americans should respond to the call of Chairman Mao: 'Workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and all those who want to oppose U.S. imperialism in the world, take action, give strong support to the struggle of the American blacks!'"

This Uruguayan friend finally said: "The peoples of the various countries of Latin America should unite, resolutely and powerfully support the heroic struggle of the American people and the struggles of the peoples of Africa and Asia, because, as Chairman Mao said: 'The struggle of the American blacks for liberation is a component part of the total struggle of the peoples of the world against U.S. imperialism, and a component part of the contemporary world revolution.'"

A Peruvian friend expressed firm support for Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence. He said: All revolutionary fighters, regardless of nationality and skin color, should unite with the American people, deepen their hatred of U.S. imperialism, and resolutely annihilate the common enemy of the peoples of the world, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. The struggle of the American blacks will surely win.

A Cuban worker said: "Chairman Mao pointed out in the statement, 'The struggle of the American blacks for liberation is a component part of the total struggle of the peoples of the world against U.S. imperialism.' This means that the struggle of the American blacks is not an isolated struggle, it is closely linked with the struggles of the peoples of various countries, Chairman Mao's point of view gives their struggle great support and encouragement."

An African friend residing in Cuba said: "The struggle of the American blacks and the struggle of the African people are closely related. The continuous rise of the struggle of the American blacks is a great encouragement to the anti-U.S. struggles of the African people and the peoples of the world."

He went on to say: "Chairman Mao is the great leader of the Chinese people and also the great leader of the African people. At this critical moment, he once again issued a statement supporting the struggle of the American blacks against violence, which is not only a great encouragement and support to the struggle of the American blacks but also a great encouragement and support to the anti-U.S. struggles of the African people and the peoples of the world. Therefore, as an African revolutionary, I express my heartfelt love and gratitude to Chairman Mao and the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao."

    新华社哈瓦那二十五日电　拉丁美洲一些朋友热情欢呼毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明。他们指出，毛主席的声明不仅是对美国黑人的巨大支持和鼓舞，而且是对全世界人民反美斗争的巨大支持和鼓舞。
    一位乌拉圭朋友说：“毛主席的声明是对全世界各国人民反对美帝国主义的斗争和越南人民反对美帝国主义的斗争的巨大支持和鼓舞。作为一个拉丁美洲人，我可以说，美国黑人的斗争就是我们自己的斗争，因为，我们有共同的目标把我们连结在一起。美国黑人用革命的暴力反抗反革命的暴力，这使我们感到巨大的鼓舞。”
    这位乌拉圭朋友接着说：美国黑人的斗争并不是孤立的。他说：“我们拉丁美洲人要响应毛主席发出的呼吁：‘世界各国的工人、农民、革命知识分子和一切愿意反对美帝国主义的人们，行动起来，给予美国黑人的斗争以强大的声援！’”
    这位乌拉圭朋友最后说：“我们拉丁美洲各国人民应该团结起来，坚决、有力地支持美国人民的英勇斗争和非洲、亚洲各国人民的斗争，因为，正如毛主席所说的：‘美国黑人争取解放的斗争，是全世界人民反对美帝国主义的总斗争的一个组成部分，是当代世界革命的一个组成部分。’”
    一位秘鲁朋友表示坚决拥护毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明。他说：一切革命战士，不分国家和肤色，都应该和兄弟的美国人民同仇敌忾，加深对美帝国主义的仇恨；下定决心，坚决消灭世界人民的共同敌人美帝国主义及其走狗。美国黑人的斗争必将获得胜利。
    一位古巴工人说：“毛主席在声明中指出，‘美国黑人争取解放的斗争，是全世界人民反对美帝国主义的总斗争的一个组成部分’。这就是说，美国黑人的斗争不是一个孤立的斗争，它同各国人民的斗争是有密切关联的，毛主席的这个论点给他们的斗争以巨大的支持和鼓舞。”
    一个居住在古巴的非洲朋友说：“美国黑人的斗争和非洲人民的斗争是休戚相关的。美国黑人斗争的不断高涨，是对非洲人民和全世界人民反美斗争的巨大鼓舞。”
    他接着说：“毛主席是中国人民的伟大领袖，也是我们非洲人民的伟大领袖，他在这个关键时刻再次发表支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明，不仅是对美国黑人斗争的巨大鼓舞和支持，而且是对我们非洲人民和全世界人民的反美斗争的巨大鼓舞和支持。因此，我作为一个非洲革命者，向毛主席和在毛主席领导下的中国人民表示衷心的热爱和感谢。”
