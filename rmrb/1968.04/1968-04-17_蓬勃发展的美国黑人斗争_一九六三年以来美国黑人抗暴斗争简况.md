Since August 8, 1963, when our great leader Chairman Mao issued the statement "In Support of the American Blacks in Their Just Struggle Against Racial Discrimination by U.S. Imperialism," American blacks have become increasingly aware and have launched one courageous struggle after another against racial discrimination. They fear no violence, fight bravely, and have dealt heavy blows to U.S. imperialism. Now, with the intensification of the American black struggle, more and more black masses are joining the ranks of the anti-violence struggle, forming an irresistible tide.

	1963
At the end of August, more than 250,000 blacks from all 50 states in the U.S. and overseas, along with whites supporting the black struggle, held an unprecedented march in Washington to oppose racial discrimination.

	1964
In New York, San Francisco, Chicago, and dozens of other major cities and towns, large-scale black struggles against racial discrimination in education, housing, employment, and other areas broke out. In July, blacks in the Harlem district of New York City launched the prelude to large-scale armed anti-violence struggles in the U.S. Thousands of black people, enraged by the savage killing of a black child by the police, took to the streets with stones, sticks, and Molotov cocktails as weapons, fighting against thousands of armed police for six days and nights. Inspired by the heroic struggle of blacks in Harlem, many cities saw blacks launching anti-violence struggles of various scales.

	1965
In January, blacks in Selma, Alabama, in the southern U.S., launched a large-scale, sustained struggle for voting rights. Over ten thousand people in Washington, New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Detroit, and more than 20 other cities held grand demonstrations to support the struggle of blacks in Selma. In August, blacks in the Watts district of Los Angeles, protesting the unjust arrest of a black youth by the police, bravely took up arms and engaged in a sniper battle with nearly 20,000 armed police and military for nearly ten days and nights. At the same time, Chicago also saw the largest anti-violence struggle in more than a decade.

	1966
In March and May, blacks in Los Angeles took up arms multiple times to fight against the police's gunning down of blacks and racial persecution. In July, blacks in Chicago engaged in a four- to five-day anti-violence struggle, resisting the suppression of nearly a thousand armed police. That summer, 38 major and medium-sized cities saw black anti-violence struggles.

	1967
In April, black students in Nashville, Tennessee, rebelled and fought against the armed suppression of over 400 police. In mid-July, blacks in Newark, New Jersey, protesting the unjust arrest of blacks, engaged in four days and nights of fierce battles with over 7,000 fully armed police and military. In late July, blacks in Detroit, protesting the unjust arrest of people, launched an unprecedented large-scale anti-violence struggle. Tens of thousands of black people took up arms and fought bravely against nearly 20,000 police and military sent by the U.S. reactionary government, setting off over 1,300 fires across the city, paralyzing the entire city of Detroit. In August, for the first time, black people in the U.S. capital Washington launched an armed anti-violence struggle. Throughout the summer, the flames of black anti-violence struggles spread across more than 90 cities in dozens of states in the U.S.

	1968
The anti-violence struggle of American blacks came earlier this year. In early February, black students in Orangeburg, South Carolina, fought bravely against the reactionary police and military. On March 28, over 6,000 black people in Memphis, Tennessee, demonstrated in support of over 1,000 sanitation workers on strike, fighting bravely against over 4,000 police and military sent to suppress them. On the evening of April 4, after the black pastor Martin Luther King was shot and killed by white racists, black people across the U.S. rose up and launched an unprecedented large-scale anti-violence struggle, spreading to over 100 cities in just a few days.

    蓬勃发展的美国黑人斗争
    ——一九六三年以来美国黑人抗暴斗争简况
    自从一九六三年八月八日，我们伟大领袖毛主席发表《支持美国黑人反对美帝国主义种族歧视的正义斗争的声明》以来，美国黑人进一步觉醒，一次又一次地掀起了英勇的反对种族歧视的斗争。他们不畏强暴，前赴后继，给美帝国主义以沉重的打击。现在，随着美国黑人斗争的高涨，越来越多的黑人群众投入了抗暴斗争的大军，形成了一股不可阻挡的洪流。
        一九六三年
    八月底，二十五万多来自美国全国五十个州及侨居海外的黑人和支持黑人斗争的白人，在华盛顿举行了规模空前的反对种族歧视的“自由进军”。
        一九六四年
    在纽约、旧金山、芝加哥等数十个主要城市和城镇，先后爆发了大规模的黑人群众反对在教育、住房、就业等方面种族歧视的斗争。七月，纽约市哈莱姆区黑人揭开了美国黑人大规模武力抗暴斗争的序幕。数千黑人群众为了抗议警察野蛮杀害黑人儿童的暴行，忿怒地涌上街头，用石块、棍棒和燃烧瓶等作为武器，同数千名武装警察搏斗了六昼夜。在哈莱姆区黑人英勇斗争的鼓舞下，许多城市的黑人纷纷开展了不同规模的抗暴斗争。
          一九六五年
    一月，美国南方亚拉巴马州塞尔马市的黑人，为争取选举权，掀起了大规模的持久的斗争。华盛顿、纽约、芝加哥、旧金山、底特律等二十多个城市的十多万群众，分别举行了盛大示威，声援塞尔马黑人的斗争。八月，洛杉矶市瓦茨区黑人为抗议警察无理逮捕黑人青年，不畏强暴，夺取枪支展开狙击战，同近两万名武装军警搏斗了近十个昼夜。与此同时，在芝加哥也爆发了十多年来规模最大的一次抗暴斗争。
          一九六六年
    三月和五月，洛杉矶市黑人多次拿起武器，同反动警察进行英勇搏斗，抗议警察枪杀黑人的暴行，反对种族迫害。七月，芝加哥黑人进行了持续四、五天的抗暴斗争，抗击了近千名武装警察的镇压。这一年夏天，一共有三十八个大中城市爆发了黑人的抗暴斗争。
          一九六七年
    四月，田纳西州纳什维尔黑人学生起来造反，抗击四百多名警察的武装镇压。七月中旬，新泽西州纽瓦克黑人为抗议警察无理逮捕黑人，同七千多名全副武装的军警进行了四天四夜的激烈战斗。七月下旬，底特律黑人为抗议警察无理抓人，掀起了空前未有的大规模抗暴斗争。成千上万的黑人群众拿起武器，同美国反动政府派出的近两万名军警进行英勇战斗，在全市先后燃起一千三百多起烈火，使整个底特律市陷于瘫痪。八月，在美国首都华盛顿第一次爆发了黑人群众的武力抗暴斗争。整个夏天，黑人抗暴斗争的烈火燃遍了美国几十个州的九十多个城市。
          一九六八年
    美国黑人的抗暴斗争比往年来得早。二月初，南卡罗来纳州沃林季堡的黑人学生同反动军警展开英勇搏斗。
    三月二十八日，田纳西州孟菲斯城六千多名黑人群众，为了支持坚持罢工的一千多名清洁工人举行示威，同派去镇压的四千多名军警进行英勇搏斗。四月四日晚，在黑人牧师马丁·路德·金被白人种族主义者枪杀以后，美国各地黑人群众纷纷起来，展开了规模空前的抗暴斗争，几天之内就扩展到了一百几十个城市。（附图片）
