On the morning of the earthquake in the Librashede area, the cooperative member Dason Sadinaishi was working in the fields by the blue Dewoli River. Suddenly, the earth shook, and he immediately thought, "Such a strong earthquake, how many of our brothers will be in danger! I must rush to help our suffering class brothers."

With a heart full of passion, Sadinaishi arrived in Librashede and worked alongside bricklayers from all over the country. He toiled day and night, building houses for those who had lost their homes. However, just as the last house he was building was about to be completed, he unfortunately fell from a height and sacrificed his life for his class brothers.

The villagers, with deep sorrow and respect, buried him in the land of Mariki. From Sadinaishi's hometown, thirty volunteers immediately came to take his place, led by his wife, Nifei Sadinaishi. As she left home, she proudly instructed her children, "Stay with Grandma and study hard. I am going to take Dad's place!"

Later, the deeds of Dason Sadinaishi were widely praised by the people in the earthquake-stricken area. The crowds heading to Lounik Village to participate in the disaster relief work continuously sang loudly:

"The earthquake shook Lounik Village, causing rivers to roar and mountains to tremble,
Sadinaishi sacrificed himself for the people with a noble spirit.
The people of Lounik will forever remember you,
You make us and our motherland feel incredibly proud!"

    为了自己的阶级兄弟
    利布拉什德区发生地震的那天早晨，合作社社员道松·萨底纳希正在蔚蓝的得沃利河畔上种地。突然间，大地摇动起来，他立刻想到：“这么强烈的地震，有多少弟兄要遭到生命危险啊！我得赶紧去帮助受难的阶级弟兄们。”
    怀着满腔的热情，萨底纳希来到利布拉什德，同来自全国的泥瓦工人一起劳动。他夜以继日地忙碌着，为那些失去了家园的人们修建房屋。可是，当他建筑的最后一所房子快要落成的时候，却不幸从高处摔下来，为阶级弟兄献出了自己的生命。
    村里的同志们怀着十分悲痛和尊敬的心情，把他安葬在马里其的土地上。而从萨底纳希的家乡又马上来了三十名义务劳动者去接他的班，领队的就是萨底纳希的妻子妮菲·萨底纳希。离家时，她骄傲地嘱咐孩子们：“跟祖母在家里好好学习，我去接爸爸的班！”
    后来，道松·萨底纳希的事迹被地震灾区的人们广泛传诵。开往留尼克村参加救灾支援工作的人群，不断地响起了嘹亮的歌声：
    “地震把留尼克村震撼得河啸山摇，
    萨底纳希为人民牺牲风格崇高。
    留尼克的乡亲们永远把你怀念，
    你使我们和祖国感到无比自豪！”
