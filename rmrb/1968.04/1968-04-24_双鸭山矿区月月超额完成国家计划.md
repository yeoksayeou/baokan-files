The Dushan mining area in Heilongjiang Province has consistently exceeded the national plan every month since January, achieving a double harvest in coal mining and tunneling, and completing the first quarter's production tasks five days ahead of schedule.

The revolutionary committees and the People's Liberation Army's propaganda teams stationed in the Dushan mining area have always insisted on highlighting proletarian politics, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide production, and educating the broad masses of workers to pour their loyalty to Chairman Mao into the practical actions of "seizing the revolution and promoting production." The broad masses of workers say: "Our love for Chairman Mao cannot be just in words; we must produce more coal and better coal, completely and thoroughly for the people." The East Mine of the Si Fangtai Mine fell short by nearly 2,000 tons of coal on February 20 due to poor production conditions. At that time, some comrades said: "Let it be short for this month! We can make up for it next month." The revolutionary committee and the propaganda team stationed at the mine immediately seized this active thought, organizing everyone to study Chairman Mao's great teachings on "seizing the revolution and promoting production," and organizing discussions. During the discussion, everyone unanimously expressed: "If we fall short this month and make up for it next month, it is not just a matter of time and production volume, but a fundamental attitude towards whether we are loyal to Chairman Mao. Even if we make up for the shortfall next month, we can never make up for our miners' loyalty to Chairman Mao." Inspired by the thought of producing more coal to express loyalty to Chairman Mao, revolutionary workers united as one, joined forces, raced against time, took the initiative, and finally made up for the shortfall, even exceeding the monthly plan.

    双鸭山矿区月月超额完成国家计划
    黑龙江省双鸭山矿区，从一月份以来月月超额完成国家计划，实现了采煤、掘进双丰收，并提前五天完成了第一季度生产任务。
    双鸭山矿区各级革命委员会和解放军驻矿毛泽东思想宣传队始终坚持突出无产阶级政治，用毛泽东思想统帅生产，教育广大职工把对毛主席的一片忠心倾注在“抓革命，促生产”的实际行动中。广大职工说：“我们热爱毛主席不能爱在口头上，一定要多出煤，出好煤，完全彻底为人民。”四方台矿东井在二月二十日因生产条件不好，欠产近二千吨煤。当时有个别同志说：“欠就欠了吧！下月再补。”革委会和驻井宣传队的同志抓住这个活思想，立即组织大家学习毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大教导，并组织座谈讨论。在讨论中，大家一致表示：“这个月欠，下个月补，不仅仅是时间和产量的问题，而是对毛主席忠不忠的根本态度问题。即使是下个月补上了欠产的煤，可是，怎么也补不上我们矿工对毛主席的一片忠心。”革命职工在多产煤炭向毛主席献忠心的思想鼓舞下，上下一条心，拧成一股劲，抢时间，争主动，终于把欠产的煤全部补上，而且超额完成了月计划。
