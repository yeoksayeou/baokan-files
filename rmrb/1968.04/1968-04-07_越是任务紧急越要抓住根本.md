Last March, five companies of our regiment received an urgent construction task. They had to excavate a canal 7 meters wide and 3 kilometers long within a month. According to the requirements, each person had to excavate 1.5 cubic meters of soil per day; otherwise, the task could not be completed on time, affecting the irrigation and drainage of the fields. However, in March in the north, the ground was still frozen and covered with snow, making the soil as hard as stone. A pickaxe could only leave a small white mark. Initially, each person could only excavate 0.5 cubic meters of soil per day. At this rate, it would take three months to complete the task.

To save time, four companies started working as soon as they arrived at the construction site. However, the Eighth Company stayed behind to study. There was much discussion within the regiment about the Eighth Company's actions. Some said, "With so much work to do, everyone is under pressure, and yet they sit down to study. They really have the patience." Others said, "The Eighth Company is a model company, and in this arduous task, they should take the lead and set an example, but instead, they fall behind." To understand the situation, I went to the Eighth Company to see for myself. It turned out that the Eighth Company had gathered troops from various agricultural support points to the construction site. Due to the change in tasks, some problems arose among the cadres and soldiers. To help comrades understand the significance of completing this construction task and to better study and apply Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts, they spent three days studying and discussing to unify their thoughts. I reported this situation to the regiment's party committee, and the committee members unanimously agreed that the Eighth Company's approach of focusing on studying and applying Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts in the midst of numerous tasks was completely correct. The regiment's party committee firmly supported the Eighth Company's approach and promoted their experience, organizing the troops to further study Chairman Mao's statements on political work and Vice Chairman Lin's instructions on emphasizing politics. Each company, in accordance with the resolutions of the enlarged meeting of the Military Commission, carried out the "Two Remembrances and Two Observations" activities, recalling the history of the struggle between the two lines, observing the great significance of emphasizing proletarian politics; recalling the history of the company's development and personal growth, observing the great significance of holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Through the re-study and implementation of emphasizing politics, each company brought political work to the construction site, greatly promoting the ideological transformation of the cadres and soldiers. Comrades had more of Chairman Mao's thoughts in their minds, were not afraid of self-criticism, were not afraid of hard work, and were not afraid of hardship. During the construction, the soldiers also came up with many good ideas, creating the "double pickaxe vibration method," which doubled the work efficiency compared to the previous single pickaxe method. They also adjusted the "segmented assault" to "full-line layering" based on the daily thawing of 10 centimeters of topsoil, rapidly increasing the construction progress. The entire regiment completed the construction task 10 days ahead of schedule.

The successful completion of this construction task gave the entire regiment a vivid lesson in emphasizing politics. Everyone further realized that emphasizing proletarian politics, using Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle, and promoting the ideological transformation of people is the fundamental aspect of our military construction. No matter how arduous and complicated the tasks are, and no matter how numerous the tasks are, we must firmly grasp this fundamental aspect. By grasping this fundamental aspect, we grasp the politics within politics, the soul within the soul, and the core within the core. No matter how great the difficulties are, they can be overcome, and no matter how great the storms are, they can be withstood, and we will be invincible.

    越是任务紧急越要抓住根本
    某团政治委员　白永坡
    去年三月，我们团的五个连队接受了一项紧急施工任务。要在一个月内，挖一条宽七米、长三千米的干渠。按要求每人每天必须挖土一点五立方米，否则，就不能按期完工，影响农田的排灌。可是，北国的三月仍然冰封雪飘，土冻得象石头一样，镐头下去留一个小白点。开始，每人一天只挖零点五立方米土。照这个进度，三个月也完不成任务。
    为了争取时间，有四个连队一到工地就开工了。但是，这时八连却在家里学习。对于八连的做法，团里议论纷纷，有的说：“这么多的工作，急得人火烧眉毛，还坐下来学习，真是稳得住劲。”有的说：“八连是拔尖的四好连队，在这个艰巨的任务中，应该干到前面去，起个先锋作用，想不到落在后头。”为了弄清情况，我到八连走一走，看一看。原来八连从各个支农点上把部队集合起来开到工地，由于任务转换，干部战士中出现了一些思想问题。为了使同志们能够认识完成这次施工任务的意义，更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，促进思想革命化，他们要用三天时间进行学习、讨论，统一思想认识。我把这个情况向团党委做了汇报，党委的同志一致认为，八连在千头万绪的工作中，抓住活学活用毛泽东思想，用伟大的毛泽东思想来统一大家的思想，他们的做法是完全正确的。团党委坚决支持八连的做法，并且推广了他们的经验，组织部队进一步学习毛主席关于政治工作的论述和林副主席有关突出政治的指示。各连对照军委扩大会议决议，开展了“两忆两看”活动，回忆两条路线的斗争史，看突出无产阶级政治的伟大意义；回忆连队的发展史和个人的成长史，看高举毛泽东思想红旗的伟大意义。通过对突出政治的再学习再落实，各连都把政治工作做到工地，大大地促进了干部战士的思想革命化。同志们头脑里毛泽东思想多了，斗私不怕疼，施工不怕累，生活不怕苦。在施工中，战士们还想出很多好办法，创造了“双镐震动法”，比过去单镐刨土提高工效一倍。还根据每天有十厘米表土化冻的情况，把“分段突击”，变为
  “全线起层”，施工进度迅速提高，全团提前十一天完成了施工任务。
    这次施工任务的胜利完成，给全团同志上了一次生动的突出政治的课。大家进一步认识到：突出无产阶级政治，用毛泽东思想挂帅，搞好人的思想革命化，是我军建设的根本。无论任务多么艰巨繁重，无论工作怎样千头万绪，都要牢牢地抓住这个根本。抓住了这个根本，就抓住了政治中的政治，灵魂中的灵魂，核心中的核心，多么大的困难也能克服，多么大的风浪也能顶住，就会无往而不胜。
