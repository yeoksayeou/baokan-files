Following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment is the key to victory. The revolutionary and production situation in the Fuxin Mining Bureau is excellent.

Based on the achievement of revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination at the grassroots units, the revolutionary committee of the bureau was successfully established. Since the beginning of this year, coal production across the bureau has been steadily increasing.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, April 10 — Under the guidance of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams stationed in the mines, the revolutionary workers of the Fuxin Mining Bureau have closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Over 90% of the grassroots units in the entire mining area have achieved revolutionary great unity by class, by shaft, by workshop, and by mine. Out of the fifteen mines and factories under the mining area, only two units have not yet established revolutionary committees. On this basis, the revolutionary committee of the Fuxin Mining Bureau was successfully established on April 7.

The Fuxin mining area is one of the important coal production bases in China. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses and workers of the proletariat in the Fuxin mining area have resolutely fought against a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, making tremendous contributions. Due to the instigation of class enemies, revolutionary workers were once divided into two factions and remained in a state of opposition for a long time. The People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams guided everyone to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's latest instructions: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to necessarily split into two irreconcilable factions." The comrades from the army also helped them organize Mao Zedong Thought study classes, promoting revolutionary great unity. The entire mining area set up over 500 study classes of various types, with over 50,000 workers participating in the study. In these classes, revolutionary masses used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to criticize and repudiate selfishness and revisionism, overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, enhance proletarian party spirit, eliminate misunderstandings, and strengthen unity. The entire mining area quickly launched a wave of revolutionary great unity, with lower levels promoting higher levels, higher levels leading lower levels, and everyone striving to catch up with each other.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Correctly handling cadres is a key issue in implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination, consolidating revolutionary great unity, and doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the unit. This issue must be resolved." The People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Teams stationed in the mines also helped cadres and the masses deeply criticize the reactionary line of "striking down a large number and protecting a small number" advocated by Liu Shaoqi in the cadre issue. They carried out activities to recall bitterness and think of sweetness, inviting old workers to talk about the history of the mine and their family history, raising the awareness of class struggle and line struggle among cadres and the masses, and promoting the revolutionary three-in-one combination. Now, over 80% of the cadres in the entire mining area have been liberated. Some revolutionary cadres have been elected by the masses to participate in the temporary power organs of the revolutionary three-in-one combination. The former deputy director of the mining bureau, with the help of the broad revolutionary masses, went through self-criticism and repudiation of revisionism, drew a clear line with a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, bravely stood up in revolution, and took on the double burden of revolution and production. Now, the revolutionary masses have elected him as the deputy director of the Fuxin Mining Bureau Revolutionary Committee.

The revolutionary workers of the Fuxin Mining Bureau have seriously implemented Chairman Mao's great instructions of "grasp revolution, promote production" and "be thrifty and make revolution." They have firmly held their production posts, insisted on the eight-hour workday, and launched a wave of emulation and surpassing each other. The coal production level of the entire bureau has been steadily increasing since the beginning of this year. In March, the main production indicators such as coal mining, tunneling, and stripping were all higher than in January and February. High De Mine, Ping'an Mine, and many shafts, mining areas, coal mining sections, and tunneling teams have overfulfilled the first quarter's coal mining and tunneling plans.

In Benxi Mining Bureau, Liaoning Province, Comrade Tian, a member of the revolutionary committee of Tian's Coal Mine, went deep into the production frontline. Together with the workers, he studied and applied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, grasped revolution, and promoted production.

    紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署就是胜利
    阜新矿务局革命生产形势大好
    在各基层单位实现革命大联合、革命三结合的基础上，局革命委员会胜利诞生，今年以来全局煤炭生产步步上升
    新华社沈阳十日电　阜新矿务局广大革命职工在驻矿人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全矿区百分之九十以上的基层单位按班组、按坑口车间、按厂矿实现了革命大联合，矿区所属十五个厂、矿，除两个单位外都建立了革命委员会。在这一基础上，阜新矿务局革命委员会于四月七日胜利诞生。
    阜新矿区是我国煤炭生产的重要基地之一。在无产阶级文化大革命中，阜新矿区无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工向党内一小撮走资派进行了坚决的斗争，作出了巨大贡献。由于阶级敌人的挑动，革命职工曾分成两派，很长时期处于对立状态。人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队引导大家反复学习了毛主席的最新指示：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”解放军同志还帮助他们举办毛泽东思想学习班，促进革命的大联合。整个矿区，办起各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班五百多个，有五万多名职工参加了学习。在学习班里，革命群众以毛泽东思想为武器，斗私批修，克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性，消除了隔阂，增强了团结。全矿区很快掀起了以下促上，以上带下，你追我赶的革命大联合高潮。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“正确地对待干部，是实行革命三结合，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位斗、批、改的关键问题，一定要解决好。”驻矿人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队还帮助干部、群众深入批判中国赫鲁晓夫在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，并开展忆苦思甜活动，请老工人讲矿史、家史，提高干部和群众阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，促进了革命的三结合，现在，全矿区百分之八十以上的干部都已得到解放。有的革命干部被群众推选参加了革命三结合的临时权力机构。矿务局原副局长在广大革命群众的帮助下，通过斗私批修，同党内一小撮走资派划清了界限，勇敢地站出来革命，挑起了革命和生产两副重担。现在，革命群众推选他担任阜新矿务局革命委员会副主任。
    阜新矿务局广大革命职工认真贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”和“要节约闹革命”的伟大指示，坚守生产岗位，坚持八小时工作制，展开了比学赶帮超竞赛热潮。全局今年以来煤炭生产水平步步上升。三月份，采煤、掘进、剥离等主要生产指标都比一、二月份有所提高。高德矿、平安矿和许多井口、采区、采煤段、掘进队都超额完成了第一季度采煤、掘进计划。（附图片）
