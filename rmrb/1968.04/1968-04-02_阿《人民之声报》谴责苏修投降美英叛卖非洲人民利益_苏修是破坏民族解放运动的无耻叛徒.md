	Albanian "People's Voice" Newspaper Denounces Soviet Revisionists' Betrayal of African People's Interests by Surrendering to the U.S. and Britain
	Soviet Revisionists Are Shameless Traitors Who Sabotage National Liberation Movements
	New China News Agency Tirana, March 31st - The editorial board of the Albanian newspaper "People's Voice" published an article on March 30th, exposing and denouncing the savage racial discrimination and oppression policies carried out by the white colonial regimes in South Africa and Southern Rhodesia with the backing of U.S. and British imperialism. It also condemns the Soviet revisionists for playing the shameful role of a fire brigade that splits and sabotages the national liberation struggle.

	The article states that U.S. and British imperialism, in order to maintain their monopoly interests in South Africa and Southern Rhodesia, are fully supporting the white racists in South Africa and the Smith racist regime in Southern Rhodesia.

	The article reveals that the Soviet revisionists, through covert and indirect means, provide immense aid to the U.S. imperialists and their colonialist and racist allies in South Africa and Southern Rhodesia. They play a double-dealing game, betraying the African people, surrendering to U.S. and British imperialism, and acting as a fire brigade to sabotage the liberation struggles of various peoples. The Soviet revisionists and the U.S. imperialists are constantly strengthening their alliance to dominate the world, actively colluding, and plotting conspiracies against the peoples of various countries.

	The article states that to achieve this goal, they use the United Nations organization, which is manipulated by the Soviet Union and the U.S., to pass numerous so-called "anti-apartheid" and "anti-racial discrimination" resolutions over the years. The U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists use these empty documents to spread illusions among the African people and numb their will to fight against old and new colonialism and savage racial segregation and oppression.

	The article points out that the African people and all anti-imperialist forces are increasingly recognizing that only by using revolutionary violence to oppose fascist violence, racism, and imperialist aggression can they win freedom and national independence. Whether it is imperialists, revisionists, or the United Nations, they will never grant freedom and national independence to them. The peoples of various countries suffering under the claws of colonialism and white racism, inspired by the great anti-U.S. struggle of the heroic Vietnamese people, are increasingly taking up arms to fight against their oppressors.

	The article concludes by stating that the Albanian people have supported and will continue to more strongly support the liberation struggles of the peoples of various countries against imperialism, old and new colonialism, and cruel racial oppression.

    阿《人民之声报》谴责苏修投降美英叛卖非洲人民利益
    苏修是破坏民族解放运动的无耻叛徒
    新华社地拉那三十一日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》三月三十日发表编辑部文章，揭露和谴责南非和南罗得西亚白人殖民当局在美、英帝国主义纵容下，推行野蛮的种族歧视和种族压迫政策，谴责苏修充当分裂和破坏民族解放斗争的消防队的可耻角色。
    文章说，美、英帝国主义为了维护他们在南非和南罗得西亚的垄断利益，正在全面地支持南非的白人种族主义者和南罗得西亚史密斯种族主义者。
    文章揭露说，苏联修正主义者通过隐蔽的和间接的手法，给予美帝国主义者及其在南非和南罗得西亚的殖民主义和种族歧视同盟者以巨大的援助。他们玩弄着两面派手法，背叛非洲人民，投降美、英帝国主义，扮演着破坏各国人民解放斗争的消防队角色。苏修同美帝不断地加强苏美主宰世界的联盟，积极进行勾结，策划反对各国人民的阴谋诡计。
    文章说，为了达到这一目的，他们利用由苏、美操纵的联合国组织，多年来通过了许多所谓的“反对种族隔离”和“种族歧视”的决议，美帝和苏修利用这些空文，来向非洲人民散布幻想，麻痹非洲人民反对新老殖民主义和野蛮的种族隔离、种族压迫的斗争意志。
    文章指出，非洲人民和一切反帝力量越来越认识到，只有用革命的暴力来反对法西斯暴力和种族主义以及帝国主义的侵略，才能赢得自由和民族独立。不管是帝国主义者、修正主义者或者联合国，都绝不会把自由和民族独立恩赐给他们。在殖民主义和白人种族主义者魔爪下遭受苦难的各国人民在英雄的越南人民伟大反美斗争的鼓舞下，越来越多的拿起武器同压迫者作斗争。
    文章最后说，阿尔巴尼亚人民过去支持今后将继续更加有力地支持各国人民为反对帝国主义、新老殖民主义和残酷的种族压迫而进行的解放斗争。
