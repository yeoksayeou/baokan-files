The Chinese People's Liberation Army's Guangdong Province Huiyang Military Sub-district held a grand award ceremony in Shenzhen, Bao'an County, on April 6 to commend the militia in the Shenzhen area for their contributions in supporting the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon in their anti-British struggle. The ceremony encouraged them to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize proletarian politics, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end, and support the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon in their anti-British struggle to the end.

Attending the ceremony were Guangdong Provincial Military Area responsible person Mao Hefa, Huiyang Military Sub-district responsible person, and Bao'an County Revolutionary Committee responsible person. Representatives from Guangdong Provincial Militia Advanced Collective Red Vanguard Company, Port Hero Militia Company, Guangzhou Troops Advanced Unit for Studying Chairman Mao's Works—Huangshandong Brigade Militia Battalion, and the Shatoujiao Town Militia Company, which collectively earned the first-class merit for their support in the anti-British struggle of patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, were also invited to the ceremony. Ten thousand militia members and People's Liberation Army soldiers from the Shenzhen area participated in the ceremony.

The militia squads from Shenzhen's Wenjindu Port Transfer Station and Luo Fang Village of Fucheng Commune were each awarded a collective second-class merit, and thirteen militia members were awarded individual second-class and third-class merits at the ceremony.

The ceremony began with the solemn song "The East Is Red." Guangdong Provincial Military Area responsible person Mao Hefa spoke at the ceremony.

He said, the great victory achieved by the Shenzhen militia in supporting the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon in their anti-British struggle once again proves that the greatest combat effectiveness comes from people armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought. As long as we consistently study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, all seemingly powerful enemies can be defeated, and victory will surely be ours.

He said, the great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until they are wiped out—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world in dealing with the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic." Although the paper tiger nature of the Hong Kong British authorities has been exposed, they are not willing to admit defeat and will continue to struggle desperately. In recent times, the Hong Kong British authorities have continued to infringe upon the legitimate rights of Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong, their persecution of our patriotic compatriots has not stopped, and they have also created incidents and provoked conflicts along the border, which we cannot tolerate. Together with all the people of the province and the country, we are determined to be the strong backing of the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, and resolutely support them in their anti-British struggle to the end. He sternly warned the Hong Kong British authorities that if they dare to make trouble and continue to provoke, they will surely face even more severe punishment from the Chinese people.

Representatives of the advanced collectives and individuals who have made meritorious deeds in supporting the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon in their anti-British struggle expressed in their speeches that they will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, continuously promote the revolutionization of thought, heighten vigilance, strengthen preparedness, and together with the great Chinese People's Liberation Army, be ready at any time to strike against various provocations and sabotage activities by domestic and foreign class enemies, and in defending the security of the motherland, defending the Cultural Revolution, and supporting the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon in their anti-British struggle, create new merits for the people.

    表扬在支援港九爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争中立功的民兵
    深圳举行庆功授奖大会
    广东省军区负责人严正警告港英当局，如果胆敢捣乱，继续挑衅，必将受到中国人民更加严厉的惩罚
    新华社广州七日电中国人民解放军广东省惠阳军分区六日在宝安县深圳隆重举行庆功授奖大会，表扬在支援港九爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争中作出了贡献的深圳地区民兵群众，勉励他们更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席的最新指示，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，支援港九爱国同胞把反英抗暴斗争进行到底。
    出席大会的有，广东省军区负责人毛和发，惠阳军分区负责人、宝安县革命委员会负责人。广东省民兵先进集体红色前哨连、港口英雄民兵连的代表，广州部队学习毛主席著作先进单位——黄山洞大队民兵营的代表，以及在支援港九爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争中荣立集体特等功的沙头角镇民兵连也应邀出席了大会。深圳地区的民兵和人民解放军指战员一万人参加了大会。
    宝安县深圳文锦渡搬运站民兵排、附城公社罗坊村民兵排在会上分别荣立集体二等功一次，并有十三名民兵在会上荣立个人二等功和三等功。
    大会在庄严的《东方红》歌声中开始。广东省军区负责人毛和发在会上讲话。
    他说，深圳地区民兵支援港九爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争所取得的巨大胜利再一次证明，最大的战斗力是用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的人。只要我们始终如一地活学活用毛泽东思想，那么，一切貌似强大的敌人都是可以被打败的，胜利必将属于我们。
    他说，伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”港英当局的纸老虎原形虽然已被戳穿，但它们决不甘心失败，它们还要作垂死挣扎。最近以来，港英当局还不断侵犯香港中国同胞的正当权利，对我爱国同胞的迫害一直没有停止，并且又在边境制造事端，进行挑衅，这是我们不能容忍的。我全省军民和全国人民一道，誓作港九爱国同胞的坚强后盾，坚决支持港九爱国同胞把反英抗暴斗争进行到底。他严正警告港英当局，如胆敢捣乱，继续挑衅，必将受到中国人民更加严厉的惩罚。
    在支援港九爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争中建立功勋的先进集体和先进个人代表在讲话中一致表示，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛泽东思想，不断促进思想革命化，百倍提高警惕，加强战备，和伟大的中国人民解放军一起，随时准备打击国内外一切阶级敌人的种种挑衅和阴谋破坏活动，在保卫祖国安全，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，支援港九爱国同胞的反英抗暴斗争中，为人民立新功。
