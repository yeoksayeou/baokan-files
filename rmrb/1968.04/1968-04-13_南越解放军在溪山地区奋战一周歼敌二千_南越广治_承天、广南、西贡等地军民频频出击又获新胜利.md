According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 12th: According to the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, the People's Liberation Armed Forces of Quang Tri Province in South Vietnam fought bravely in the Xi Shan battlefield from April 3rd to 9th for a week, annihilating 2,193 enemy troops, most of whom were American invaders, and shooting down and destroying 19 enemy aircraft.

The report said that on the morning of the 6th, two companies of American Marines launched a counterattack on Hill 595, where six Liberation Army soldiers were on guard. They immediately bravely joined the battle, fiercely intercepting the enemy and foiling the enemy's repeated counterattacks, annihilating 115 American invaders. On the 7th, two companies of American Marines again dared to attack Hill 595. The six Liberation Army soldiers, under the cover of their comrades, fought a very brave and agile battle, again foiling the enemy's counterattacks and achieving new victories. After four hours of fierce fighting, the six heroes annihilated more than 100 American invaders, shot down one helicopter, and damaged two jet aircraft.

They killed and wounded 650 enemy troops, almost annihilating two puppet airborne battalions, and seized a large amount of weapons. When this puppet force was fiercely attacked, the American 1st Cavalry Division stationed nearby was terrified and dared not go to rescue them.

On the 9th, the People's Liberation Armed Forces launched a fierce attack on the American troops on Hills 832 and 689. The artillery shells accurately hit the targets, causing the enemy to suffer heavy losses.

The People's Liberation Armed Forces of Quang Nam Province, from March 12th to 27th, continuously intercepted the enemy on the transportation lines and attacked many enemy strongholds, foiling the enemy's multiple "sweeping" operations. They killed and wounded more than 800 American and puppet troops and their mercenaries, destroyed 17 military vehicles, and shot down and damaged nine enemy aircraft.

The people and military of My Tho and Cu Chi counties south of Saigon City launched continuous attacks on enemy strongholds and outposts from March 19th to April 1st, thwarting the enemy's multiple "sweeping" operations south of Saigon City, annihilating 430 enemy troops, including 230 American troops.

The local forces and guerrilla units of Go Dau County, Binh Duong Province, intercepted and annihilated an entire company of puppet troops on the morning of April 7th while they were on a "sweeping" operation.

The People's Liberation Armed Forces of Binh Dinh Province seriously damaged an 8,000-ton American military transport ship anchored on the Long Du River, 26 kilometers southeast of Saigon City, in the early morning of April 4th, causing the bombs on the ship to explode violently. The flames and explosions lasted for more than two hours.

Under the brave attacks of the Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam, the American invaders suffered heavy casualties and hastily withdrew from the battlefield.
