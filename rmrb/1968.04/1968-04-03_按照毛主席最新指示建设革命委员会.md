Our great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "The basic experience of revolutionary committees is threefold: one is the representation of revolutionary cadres, one is the representation of the military, and one is the representation of revolutionary masses, achieving the three-in-one combination of the revolution. Revolutionary committees should implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative structures, streamline and downsize, and organize a revolutionary leadership team that is connected with the masses." Chairman Mao's brilliant instruction most concisely, scientifically, and comprehensively summarizes the experiences of revolutionary committees at all levels, serving as the fundamental direction for the construction of revolutionary committees at all levels. Revolutionary committees at all levels must adhere to Chairman Mao's latest instructions and truly build revolutionary leadership teams that are forever loyal to Chairman Mao and connected with the masses.

To make revolutionary committees truly revolutionary leadership teams, the most fundamental task is to actively learn from and apply Chairman Mao Zedong Thought, using Mao Zedong Thought to grasp power and use it well. This requires members of revolutionary committees at all levels to consciously make unconditional loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line their highest standard. They must strive to actively learn from and apply Mao Zedong Thought, transform their worldviews, and become models in studying, executing, propagating, and defending Chairman Mao's instructions. They must resolutely oppose bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, regionalism, and sectarianism, ensuring the unity and cohesion of revolutionary committees on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought principles, and ensuring that Chairman Mao's every instruction is swiftly and accurately conveyed and implemented. They must also lead and organize the broad revolutionary masses to launch a larger-scale movement of actively learning from and applying Mao Zedong Thought, turning our entire province into a vibrant school of Mao Zedong Thought.

The editorial "Revolutionary Committees Are Good" conveys Chairman Mao's latest instructions, serving as a great guideline for revolutionary committees at all levels to build their ideology and organization. It is a brilliant embodiment of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in the construction of state organs. Members of revolutionary committees at all levels must learn from and understand Chairman Mao's latest instructions from the height of the struggle between the two lines; from the height of defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, they must implement and execute Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They must make Chairman Mao's instructions the soul of revolutionary committees at all levels.

Let us advance along the path indicated by Chairman Mao!  Shandong Daily

专栏：各地报纸社论摘要

    按照毛主席最新指示建设革命委员会
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“革命委员会的基本经验有三条：一条是有革命干部的代表，一条是有军队的代表，一条是有革命群众的代表，实现了革命的三结合。革命委员会要实行一元化的领导，打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政，组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子。”毛主席这一光辉指示，最精辟、最科学、最完整地总结了各级革命委员会的经验，是各级革命委员会建设的根本方向。各级革命委员会必须遵照毛主席的最新指示，真正建设成永远忠于毛主席的革命化的联系群众的领导班子。
    要使革命委员会真正成为革命化的领导班子，最根本的就是活学活用、学好用好毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想掌好权、用好权。这就要求各级革命委员会的成员，自觉地把无限忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，作为对自己的最高要求，努力活学活用毛泽东思想，改造自己的世界观，做学习毛主席指示、执行毛主席指示、宣传毛主席指示、捍卫毛主席指示的模范。要坚决反对资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和山头主义、宗派主义，保证革命委员会在毛泽东思想原则基础上的团结和统一，保证毛主席每一项指示迅速地、准确地传达和贯彻。并且要带领和组织广大革命群众，开展更大规模的活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，把我们全省办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    《革命委员会好》这篇社论所传达的毛主席最新指示，是各级革命委员会进行思想建设和组织建设的伟大纲领，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线在国家机关建设方面的光辉体现。各级革命委员会的成员，必须从两条路线斗争的高度学习、领会毛主席这一最新指示；从捍卫毛主席无产阶级革命路线的高度，贯彻执行毛主席这一最新指示。使毛主席这一指示，化为各级革命委员会的灵魂。
    让我们沿着毛主席指引的方向，乘胜前进！　山东《大众日报》
