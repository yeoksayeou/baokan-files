On April 10, Beijing Knitting Mill was filled with excitement. The cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao" echoed through every workshop. Revolutionary workers and the 8341 Unit's leftist support personnel, with hearts full of excitement, studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions over and over again: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a political revolution under the conditions of socialism, where the proletariat opposes the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the revolutionary masses it leads, and the Kuomintang reactionaries. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Revolutionary workers and leftist soldiers unanimously expressed their determination to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, to strengthen class struggle awareness, to heighten revolutionary vigilance, to deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, and to launch a proactive and sustained attack on the class enemy, seizing a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Members of the factory revolutionary committee and revolutionary workers immediately held a discussion meeting. Everyone excitedly said that the establishment of the revolutionary committee in our beloved Chairman Mao's hometown, Hunan Province, signifies that the stronghold of restoring capitalism set up by the Chinese Khrushchev in Hunan Province has been demolished. This is a great joy for the people of the entire country. Chairman Mao's latest instructions have greatly enhanced the class struggle awareness and line struggle awareness of the broad revolutionary masses; they have a deeper understanding of the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the content of class struggle. Committee member of the factory revolutionary committee and revolutionary mass representative Liu Yusi said: "In the early stages of the movement, I only saw the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as a matter of the cultural sphere. Now I have a further understanding that this is a political revolution, a life-and-death class struggle. The handful of capitalist roaders within the party, led by the Chinese Khrushchev, are actually the representatives of the Kuomintang reactionaries, that is, the bourgeoisie, traitors, spies, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements. These class enemies, under the protection of the Chinese Khrushchev's big black umbrella, have infiltrated the revolutionary ranks, entered the organs of proletarian dictatorship, and occupied important positions. They wave the red flag to oppose the red flag, engage in counter-revolutionary two-faced activities, and always dream of restoring capitalism. The broad revolutionary masses' struggle against them is a continuation of the struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries." Everyone angrily said, the Chinese Khrushchev is Chiang Kai-shek who has infiltrated the revolutionary ranks. We must wield the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought to launch a fierce attack on this handful of class enemies, to expose them all, and to fight them down and expose their stench!

During the discussion, members of the revolutionary committee believed that since the establishment of the revolutionary committee at the Knitting Mill, the revolutionary and production situation has been getting better and better. However, there is also sharp class struggle. The closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to comprehensive victory, the more the class enemy will struggle desperately. At this critical moment, the revolutionary committee must closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and become the revolutionary command center that leads the revolutionary masses in the fight against the class enemy. The chairman of the factory revolutionary committee and military representative, Sun Yi, said: "Implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions is a serious class struggle. In this struggle, the task of the revolutionary committee is very arduous. We must firmly believe in the masses, rely on the masses, fully mobilize the masses, and keep the vigilance of class struggle high. We must keep our eyes sharp and expose the class enemies hiding within the ranks of the working class, implementing mass dictatorship. In this 'short-range combat,' we must take the initiative and launch continuous attacks on the class enemy. We must fight steadily, accurately, and fiercely, and we must not be lenient or show them mercy. At present, we must seriously study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and theories about class and class struggle, and carry out a deep and sustained revolutionary criticism. Only in this way can we firmly grasp the direction of the struggle. Those who dare not fight, do not mobilize the masses, and are afraid of making mistakes due to rightist conservative thoughts must be criticized."

"Navigating the sea relies on the helmsman, doing revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." During the discussion, everyone deeply felt from their personal experiences that only by striving to study and apply Chairman Mao's works can we use Mao Zedong Thought as a microscope and telescope to observe and analyze everything, maintaining a clear mind in the sharp and complex class struggle and defeating all enemies. Young female worker He Guirong said: "Our factory recently exposed a handful of bad elements. The facts revealed prove that the closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to comprehensive victory, the more cunning and deceitful the class enemies become. We young people, born in the new society and grown under the red flag, lack class struggle training and can easily be deceived by the class enemies. Only by striving to study and apply Chairman Mao's works can we improve our awareness of the two-line struggle, keeping a clear mind and a firm stance in the face of great winds and waves, and exposing the class enemies' tricks." Old worker Yi Qizhi said: "The class enemy's sabotage of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a vicious move, which is to incite factional struggles and stir up anarchist trends. The proletarian revolutionary faction must not fall for their tricks. We must study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, firmly stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and further overcome the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchist tendencies with 'criticize selfishness and repudiate revisionism' as the key, unite as one, and fight the enemy together, leaving no gaps for the enemy, and expose them one by one, fighting them down and exposing their stench!"

The revolutionary workers and leftist support personnel who participated in the discussion firmly expressed: resolutely oppose rightist conservatism, rightist splitism, and rightist capitulationism, and defend Chairman Mao to the death, and defend the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao to the death. Leftist support soldier Wang Defu said: "We are Chairman Mao's soldiers, fighting to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and dying to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We will resolutely fight alongside the broad proletarian revolutionary faction against a handful of traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist roaders, and counter-revolutionaries who have infiltrated our revolutionary ranks, fighting to the end, and not stopping until we achieve complete victory!"

    紧跟毛主席搞好这场伟大的政治大革命
    北京针织总厂革命职工学习座谈毛主席最新指示
    四月十日，北京针织总厂一片欢腾。“毛主席万岁，万万岁”的欢呼声响彻每个车间。广大革命职工和八三四一部队支左人员怀着无比兴奋的心情，一遍又一遍地学习伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。革命职工和支左战士一致坚定地表示，要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，增强阶级斗争观念，提高革命警惕性，深入开展革命大批判，向阶级敌人发起主动的持久的进攻，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    厂革命委员会成员和革命职工立即举行座谈会。大家兴奋地说，我们敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的家乡——湖南省革命委员会的成立，宣告了中国赫鲁晓夫设在湖南省的复辟资本主义的暗堡被摧垮了，这是全国人民的一件大喜事。毛主席的最新指示极大地提高了广大革命群众阶级斗争觉悟和路线斗争觉悟；对无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义和阶级斗争内容有了更深刻的认识。厂革命委员会委员、革命群众代表刘玉锡说：“运动初期，我把无产阶级文化大革命仅仅看成是文化界的事，现在更进一步认识到这是一场政治大革命，是一场你死我活的阶级大搏斗。以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派，实际上是国民党反动派即资产阶级、叛徒、特务、地富反坏右的总代表。这些阶级敌人在中国赫鲁晓夫这把大黑伞的庇护下，有的混进革命队伍，有的打入无产阶级专政机关，窃踞了重要岗位，他们打着‘红旗’反红旗，大搞反革命两面派活动，时时刻刻梦想复辟资本主义。广大革命人民群众同他们的斗争，就是同国民党反动派斗争的继续。”大家愤怒地说，中国赫鲁晓夫就是混进革命队伍中的蒋介石，我们要奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，对这一小撮阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，把他们统统揪出来，斗倒斗臭！
    座谈中，革命委员会的成员认为，针织总厂成立革命委员会以来，革命和生产形势越来越好。但同时也存在着尖锐的阶级斗争。无产阶级文化大革命越接近全面胜利，阶级敌人越要作垂死挣扎。在这关键时刻，革命委员会必须紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，成为带领革命群众向阶级敌人进行战斗的革命司令部。厂革命委员会主任、军队代表孙毅说：“落实毛主席这一最新指示，是一场严重的阶级斗争。在这场斗争中，革命委员会的战斗任务是十分艰巨的，必须坚决地相信群众，依靠群众，充分发动群众，把阶级斗争的警惕性提得高高的，把眼睛擦得亮亮的，把隐藏在工人阶级队伍内部的阶级敌人揪出来，实行群众专政。我们在这场‘短兵相接’的战斗中，一定要对阶级敌人采取主动的、连续的进攻。要打得稳，打得准，打得狠，绝不能手软，绝不能对他们施仁政。在当前，我们要认真学习毛主席的最新指示和关于阶级、阶级斗争的理论，深入地持久地开展革命大批判，这样才能牢牢掌握斗争大方向。那种不敢进行斗争，不发动群众，怕犯错误的右倾保守思想必须批判。”
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”座谈中，大家从亲身经历中深切地感受到，只有努力活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想这个显微镜和望远镜去观察一切，分析一切，才能在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中保持清醒的头脑，战胜一切敌人。青年女工郝桂荣说：“我们厂最近揪出了一小撮坏人，揭露出来的事实证明，无产阶级文化大革命越接近全面胜利，阶级敌人越阴险、狡滑。我们青年人，生在新社会，长在红旗下，缺乏阶级斗争的锻炼，很容易让阶级敌人蒙混过去。只有努力活学活用毛主席著作，提高两条路线斗争觉悟，才能在大风大浪中做到心明眼亮，立场坚定，识破阶级敌人的阴谋诡计。”老工人易其志说：
  “阶级敌人破坏无产阶级文化大革命，使用了毒辣的一着，就是挑动派性斗争，煽动无政府主义思潮。无产阶级革命派决不能上他们的当。我们一定要活学活用毛泽东思想，坚定地站在毛主席革命路线一边，以‘斗私，批修’为纲、进一步克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和无政府主义倾向，团结一致，共同对敌，让敌人无隙可乘，还要把他们一个个揪出来，斗倒、斗臭！”
    参加座谈的革命职工和支左人员坚定地表示：坚决反对右倾保守主义、右倾分裂主义和右倾投降主义，誓死保卫毛主席，誓死保卫以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部。支左战士王德福说：“我们是毛主席的战士，生为捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线而战斗，死为捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线而献身。我们坚决和广大无产阶级革命派一道，向一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派和钻进我们革命队伍里面的反革命分子战斗到底，不获全胜，决不收兵！”
