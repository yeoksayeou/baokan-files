The black struggle against violence in the United States has sounded a new call for the American people to oppose the brutal rule of the monopolistic bourgeoisie. The struggle of the American people against exploitation, oppression, and the invasion of Vietnam is surging forward.

According to a report by our correspondent on April 23, in the increasingly intense black struggle in the United States, the black struggle against violence this year has been particularly fierce and unprecedented in scale. This has dealt a heavy blow to the reactionary rule of the American monopolistic bourgeoisie. It not only reflects the growing awareness and unyielding spirit of the broad masses of black people in the United States in their struggle for freedom and liberation, but also, as the great leader Chairman Mao pointed out in his statement supporting the black struggle against violence, "is a new call for the entire exploited and oppressed American people to oppose the brutal rule of the monopolistic bourgeoisie." It heralds the further intensification of the struggle of the American people, including the black struggle against violence, against the rule of monopolistic capital.

Where there is oppression, there is resistance. The intensifying struggle of the American people, including the broad masses of black people, is the inevitable result of the reactionary policies of the American ruling class, which have become increasingly aggressive in their pursuit of external aggression and expansion, and internal oppression and exploitation. Since the Johnson administration took office, it has brazenly expanded the war in Vietnam and intensified its attacks on the American people, thereby deepening the political and economic crises at home and exacerbating class contradictions to an unprecedented degree. Now, not only have tens of thousands of the most oppressed and exploited black masses in the United States risen up to engage in the struggle against violence, but as the war in Vietnam continues to escalate, the wave of strikes by the American working class and the people's movement against the war in Vietnam are also surging forward with unprecedented vigor.

Last year, the broad masses of workers in the United States, in their struggle against the increasingly severe exploitation and oppression by the monopolistic capitalists, launched a wave of strikes that was unprecedented in its scale and intensity in fifteen years.

Starting from the beginning of last year, the wave of strikes in the United States has been continuous and unrelenting; large-scale strikes have affected a series of important industrial sectors, and many non-industrial workers, as well as teachers and medical personnel, have also joined the ranks of the strikers. The broad masses of workers have shown an increasingly tenacious fighting spirit. The large-scale strike of more than sixty thousand copper miners that began in mid-July lasted for nine months, bringing copper production in the United States to a virtual standstill and seriously affecting the production of military supplies for the war in Vietnam. At the same time as the copper miners launched their large-scale strike, the railroad workers in the United States also staged the first nationwide strike since the war. More than thirteen thousand seven hundred railroad workers, despite Johnson's threats and inducements, persisted in their strike, bringing rail freight and passenger transport in more than 95% of the United States to a complete halt for two days and nights, dealing a heavy blow to the military transport of the war in Vietnam.

The situation this year indicates that the wave of strikes by American workers is continuing to rise. More than ten thousand sanitation workers in New York City, defying the ban by the reactionary authorities, held a large-scale strike for more than a week in early February, causing garbage to pile up in the streets and alleys of this, the largest city in the United States, and filling the air with a foul stench, leaving the American ruling class in a state of disarray. More than thirty-two thousand glass workers in twenty-three states in the United States have been on strike since early February, lasting for two months; capitalists have described this as the "most prolonged and costly" strike in the history of the American glass industry. The large-scale strike of more than ninety thousand coal miners in February once brought the production of almost all brown coal in the United States to a standstill. In April, just a few days after the unprecedented scale of the black struggle against violence dealt a heavy blow to American imperialism, more than two hundred thousand telecommunications workers in forty-two states in the United States launched the first nationwide strike in more than twenty years on the 18th, dealing a new blow to the American ruling class.

The new surge in the American workers' movement is another important sign of the unprecedented sharpening of class contradictions in the United States.

As the war in Vietnam continues to "escalate," the struggle of the American people against the war in Vietnam has also surged to new heights. An increasing number of American youth are resolutely refusing to fight for the imperialist and war policies of the United States. According to official statistics that have been greatly reduced, the number of people who refused to serve in the military last year increased by nearly 80% compared to the previous year; nearly a thousand young people risked five years in prison to publicly burn their draft cards. In the American forces in Vietnam, the number of soldiers deserting is increasing. Anti-war organizations among American soldiers are also emerging.

At the same time as the anti-draft movement is becoming increasingly widespread, the broad masses of the American people from all walks of life are also launching one struggle after another against the war in Vietnam through strikes, boycotts, hunger strikes, demonstrations, and tax resistance. The chief culprits of the war in Vietnam, Johnson, Humphrey, and the likes of Rusk, have become pariahs, and wherever they go, they are invariably met with angry condemnations and curses from demonstrators, calling them "murderers" and "executioners."

In recent years, an increasing number of laborers, especially black laborers, have joined the anti-war movement. Their struggle is clearly directed against the imperialist and war policies of American imperialism, and their political slogans are more distinct. Many black youth have solemnly declared that they will not become tools for the massacre of the Vietnamese people; their battlefield is in the United States, and they are determined to fight to the end against the oppression and exploitation of the American ruling class. This fully reflects the growing political awareness of the broad masses of the American people.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out:

"The racial discrimination in the United States is a product of colonialism and imperialism." The American monopolistic bourgeoisie, on the one hand, uses racial discrimination to carry out cruel exploitation and oppression of the broad masses of black people, extracting super profits, and on the other hand, uses it to divide the American laboring people, using skin color and race to cover up the essence of class struggle, in order to maintain its reactionary rule. The entire American people, including black people, who are fighting against aggression, exploitation, and oppression, are becoming increasingly aware in the severe practice of class struggle, and are increasingly recognizing that they are on the same front, and that their common enemy is American imperialism. The struggle of black people in the United States will inevitably combine with the workers' movement in the United States and the anti-war forces of all strata of people across the country to launch a sustained and fierce attack on the criminal rule of the American monopolistic bourgeoisie, ultimately burying American imperialism once and for all.

    黑人抗暴斗争吹响美国人民反对垄断资产阶级残暴统治的新号角
    美国人民反剥削反压迫反侵越的斗争风起云涌
    据新华社二十三日讯　本社记者报道：在一年比一年高涨的美国黑人斗争中，今年来势迅猛、规模空前的美国黑人抗暴斗争，更加沉重地打击了美国垄断资产阶级的反动统治。这不仅反映了美国广大黑人争自由、求解放的觉悟日增，斗志日坚，而且正如伟大领袖毛主席在支持美国黑人抗暴斗争声明中所指出的，“是整个被剥削、被压迫的美国人民反对垄断资产阶级残暴统治的新号角。”它预示着包括黑人抗暴斗争在内的美国人民反对垄断资本统治的斗争的进一步高涨。
    那里有压迫，那里就有斗争。包括广大黑人群众在内的美国人民的斗争日益高涨，是美国统治集团变本加厉地推行对外侵略、扩张，对内压迫、剥削的反动政策的必然结果。约翰逊政府上台以后，悍然扩大侵越战争，加紧进攻美国人民，这样就大大加深了国内的政治、经济危机，使国内阶级矛盾空前激化。现在，不仅成千成万受压迫、受剥削最重的美国黑人群众，已经奋起进行抗暴斗争，而且，随着侵越战争的不断扩大，美国工人阶级的罢工斗争浪潮和人民群众反对侵越战争的运动也正在如火如荼地蓬勃发展。
    去年内美国广大工人群众为了反对垄断资本集团日益加剧的剥削和压榨，掀起了波澜壮阔的罢工斗争浪潮，其声势和规模达到了十五年来的最高峰。
    从去年年初开始，美国的罢工浪潮此伏彼起，连绵不断；大规模的罢工斗争波及了一系列重要工业部门，许多非产业工人以及教员、医护人员等等，也都投入了罢工的行列。广大工人群众表现出越来越顽强的战斗精神。去年七月中旬开始的六万多铜矿工人的大罢工，坚持了九个月，使美国铜的生产几乎全部陷于停顿，使供应美国侵越战争的军火生产受到严重影响。就在铜矿工人掀起大罢工的同时，美国铁路工人也爆发了战后第一次全国大罢工。十三万七千多名铁路工人，不顾约翰逊的威胁利诱，坚持罢工，使美国百分之九十五以上的铁路货运和客运整整停顿了两昼夜，沉重地打击了侵越战争的军事运输。
    今年以来的情况表明，美国工人罢工斗争的浪潮还在进一步高涨。纽约市一万多清洁工人，不顾反动当局的禁令，在二月初举行了历时一个多星期的大罢工，使这个美国第一大城市的大街小巷垃圾成堆，臭气熏天，弄得美国统治集团狼狈不堪。美国二十三个州的三万二千多名玻璃工人从二月初开始，坚持罢工两个月；资本家惊呼这是美国玻璃工业史上一次“最持久和代价最昂贵的”罢工。九万多名煤矿工人二月间举行的大罢工，曾经一度使美国褐煤生产的绝大部分陷于停顿。四月份，就在空前规模的黑人抗暴斗争给予美帝国主义以沉重打击之后不几天，美国四十二个州的二十多万电讯工人在十八日掀起了二十多年来的第一次全国大罢工，给予美国统治集团以新的冲击。
    美国工人运动的新高涨，是美国国内阶级矛盾空前尖锐化的又一重要标志。
    随着侵越战争的不断“升级”，美国人民反对侵越战争的斗争也出现了新的高涨。越来越多的美国青年坚决拒绝替美帝的侵略政策和战争政策卖命。据美国官方大大缩小了的统计数字，去年内拒绝服兵役的人数比前年增加了将近百分之八十；近千名青年甘冒坐牢五年的风险，当众烧毁了征兵证。在侵越美军中，士兵开小差的人数越来越多。美国士兵的反战组织也不断涌现。
    在反征兵运动不断广泛开展的同时，各阶层的美国广大人民群众还通过罢工、罢课、绝食、示威、拒缴捐税等各种方式，掀起了一次又一次反对侵越战争的斗争。侵越战争的罪魁祸首约翰逊以及汉弗莱、腊斯克之流成了过街老鼠，他们无论走到那里，都无例外地会遭到示威者的愤怒谴责，痛骂他们是“杀人犯”、“刽子手”。
    近年来，越来越多的劳动群众，特别是黑人劳动群众投入了反战运动。他们的斗争矛头明确地指向美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，斗争的政治口号更加鲜明。不少黑人青年严正宣告：他们决不去充当屠杀越南人民的工具；他们的战场就在美国国内，他们决心为反对美国统治阶级的压迫和剥削斗争到底。这充分地反映了美国广大人民政治上的日益觉醒。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出：
  “美国的种族歧视，是殖民主义、帝国主义制度的产物。”美国垄断资产阶级一方面利用种族歧视对广大黑人进行残酷的剥削和压迫，榨取超额利润，同时又利用它来分化美国劳动人民，用肤色人种来掩盖阶级斗争的实质，以维护其反动统治。包括黑人在内的、反对侵略、反对剥削和压迫的整个美国人民，正在严峻的阶级斗争实践中加速觉醒，越来越清楚地认识到，他们是站在一条战线上的，他们的共同敌人就是美帝国主义。美国黑人的斗争必将同美国工人运动结合起来，同全国各阶层人民反对侵略战争的力量结合起来，向美国垄断资产阶级的罪恶统治发动持久猛烈的进攻，最后彻底埋葬美帝国主义。
