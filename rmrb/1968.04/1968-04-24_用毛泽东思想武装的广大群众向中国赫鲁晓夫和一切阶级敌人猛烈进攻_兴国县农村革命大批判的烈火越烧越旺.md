The masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought are launching a fierce attack on the Chinese Khrushchev and all class enemies. The revolutionary criticism movement in the rural areas of Xingguo County is burning more intensely.

The bitter and resentful poor and lower-middle peasants are at the forefront. Over 300,000 revolutionary masses are actively participating in this struggle. Hidden class enemies are being exposed one by one. These exposed class enemies have become living examples for criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev's theory of the "extinction of class struggle."

According to Xinhua News Agency in Nanchang on the 23rd, the revolutionary masses of Jiangxi Province's Xingguo County, who are infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, remember Mao's teachings: "Never forget class struggle." They have launched a sustained movement of exposure, criticism, and struggle against the clique of capitalist roaders within the Party, led by the Chinese Khrushchev, and against all ghosts and snakes in society. The flames of revolutionary criticism have spread throughout the rural areas of the entire county.

In this place, whether in the fields, courtyards, or in the homes of the poor and lower-middle peasants, everywhere is a battlefield for revolutionary criticism. Here, whether it is a child of five or six years old, or an elderly person with white hair, everyone knows that the Chinese Khrushchev is the enemy of the poor and lower-middle peasants. The people here have been fully mobilized. In the hearts of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, the concept of the struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines is very clear. They say, "Socialism is the path to brightness, capitalism is a dead end." They firmly declare: "We will never forget the Communist Party for our liberation, we will never forget Chairman Mao for our happiness, and we will follow Chairman Mao in revolution to the end."

Overcoming rightist conservative thoughts, leading the broad masses to continuously and deeply carry out revolutionary criticism.

The revolutionary criticism movement in Xingguo County was initiated under the leadership of the county revolutionary committee. The county revolutionary committee believes that whether or not to lead the broad masses to actively attack the class enemies, and to completely overthrow and expose the Chinese Khrushchev and the clique of capitalist roaders within the Party politically, ideologically, and theoretically, is a major issue related to the comprehensive victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, and a fundamental issue related to the consolidation of the proletarian revolutionary regime. After the county revolutionary committee was established at the end of last year, it immediately went deep into the rural areas to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the situation of the criticism.

The inspection situation shows that after the revolutionary committee was established, some places did not tighten the criticism but showed signs of relaxing the struggle against the enemy. Some grassroots organization cadres thought that the poor and lower-middle peasants had taken power, and the class enemies were all lowering their heads and walking, even if there were a few eels, they could not overturn the boat. The county revolutionary committee paid great attention to this situation. They believed that with this kind of thought, one would lose class vigilance and not see the enemy situation; if one did not actively lead the masses to carry out revolutionary criticism and struggle against the class enemies, it would give a small number of class enemies the opportunity to carry out capitalist restoration activities in the countryside.

The revolutionary committee took swift and decisive action to organize cadres at all levels to seriously study Mao's teachings on class struggle and to conduct concentrated education for all cadres on the protection of the proletarian revolutionary regime. Various places also conducted a comprehensive analysis of the class struggle situation, exposing the crimes of class enemies inciting the masses to divide land into individual plots, disband production teams, and indiscriminately cut down forests, all of which were aimed at destroying the socialist collective economy. Through these educations, everyone further realized that the current class struggle is still sharp and complex, and the focus of the struggle is still on the issue of capitalist restoration and proletarian anti-restoration, and on the struggle between consolidating the proletarian dictatorship and overthrowing the proletarian regime. They went down to listen to the reflections of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Some old poor peasants took out Mao's sayings from the land revolution period and read them to the cadres: "The revolutionary class—the working people, use the Soviet weapon to fight against all counter-revolutionaries inside and outside, this is the first function of the Soviet." The old poor peasants earnestly told the cadres: "Do not forget Chairman Mao's teachings to the people of the old revolutionary base! If you do not use the power to fight against the enemy, you will be too confused." The words of the poor peasants deeply educated the cadres. On this basis, various grassroots organizations recalled the situation of the revolutionary forerunners who fought to the death and sacrificed their lives to seize power and defend the proletarian regime, greatly raising everyone's awareness of grasping class struggle and revolutionary criticism. Everyone unanimously proposed: To defend the proletarian revolutionary regime, we must grasp the class struggle to the end and carry out the revolutionary criticism to the end.

Revolutionary criticism must firmly rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants.

Under the unified organization of the county revolutionary committee, various places in the county generally set up training classes for revolutionary criticism cadres armed with Mao Zedong Thought. They selected poor and lower-middle peasants who were deeply resentful, firmly walked the socialist road, and had prestige among the masses from various production teams to participate in the study. After these cadres were further armed with Mao Zedong Thought, they not only took the lead in standing at the forefront of the struggle but also took many measures to mobilize the masses extensively. They and the masses together exposed the facts of class struggle, investigated the harm of class enemies carrying out capitalist restoration activities, and denounced the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev. They also, together with the masses, talked about family history and village history, recalled bitterness and sweetness, and conducted mass class education, greatly raising the class struggle consciousness and line struggle consciousness of the broad masses. Over 300,000 revolutionary people in the county are more closely united, launching a fierce attack on the Chinese Khrushchev and all class enemies, and the flames of revolutionary criticism are burning more intensely.

Grasp the main contradiction, concentrate firepower, and wage a sustained "people's war."

Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution under the conditions of socialism, where the proletariat opposes the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and its led broad revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." The Xingguo County Revolutionary Committee deeply understands that the Chinese Khrushchev and the clique of capitalist roaders within the Party are the total representatives of the interests of the Kuomintang reactionaries, that is, the bourgeoisie and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. The poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line they advocate is deep and widespread. They must lead the broad revolutionary masses to concentrate their firepower and wage a sustained "people's war" to carry out the revolutionary criticism to the end. Their approach is to firmly grasp the set of counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev in the countryside, combine them with the actual class struggle in the locality, and concentrate firepower to criticize thoroughly. For example, combining the class enemies inciting the masses to disband production teams and advocating individual sideline production, concentrate on criticizing the fallacies of "self-reliance and self-management" advocated by the clique of capitalist roaders within the Party; combining the class enemies inciting the disruption of state plans, concentrate on criticizing the fallacies of "four freedoms" advocated by a small clique of capitalist roaders; combining the struggle with untransformed landlords and rich peasants, concentrate on criticizing the fallacies of "exploitation is meritorious"; combining distribution, concentrate on criticizing the fallacies of "material incentives," etc. This way, the content of the criticism is richer and more in-depth. The class enemies in the Shanjian Production Team of Butou Commune secretly incited the masses to divide the team. After the revolutionary criticism movement, the poor and lower-middle peasants and all the team members exposed this sabotage activity of the landlords and rich peasants, making everyone realize that dividing the team is to walk the capitalist road of "self-reliance and self-management" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev. Everyone said, the Chinese Khrushchev wants us to go back to the old road and suffer twice, absolutely not. We will follow Chairman Mao and walk the bright socialist road. Longgang, Jiangbei, and Chongxian Communes, when criticizing the fallacies of "self-reliance and self-management," the community members all stood up to denounce the bitterness of "self-reliance and self-management" and exposed the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev. Some community members who were incited by class enemies to engage in individual sideline production all consciously corrected their mistakes. The community members of Renxiang Brigade in Changgang Commune, combined with distribution, severely criticized the fallacies of "material incentives" and "work points in command." They said, the "material incentives" and "work points in command" of the Chinese Khrushchev and the clique of capitalist roaders within the Party are a soft knife that kills without blood. They want to use this soft knife to cut off all the enthusiasm of the peasants to walk the socialist road and pave the way for the restoration of capitalism. The community members of Gaoshang Brigade in Butou Commune grasped the typical case of "whether to plant watermelons for more money or to plant rice according to the state plan," and severely criticized the "four freedoms" of the Chinese Khrushchev. The community members learned from Chairman Mao's teachings: "We make plans, do things, and think problems, all from the fact that our country has six hundred million people." They realized that whether to plant a few acres of watermelons or a few acres of rice is not a small matter, but a big issue of which road to take. They said, seeking profits and engaging in business freedom is to follow the Chinese Khrushchev and walk the capitalist road; starting from the six hundred million people and acting according to the state plan is to wholeheartedly walk the socialist road.

The broad revolutionary masses of Xingguo County are like this, taking the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines as the guideline, discovering a problem and deeply launching a criticism, the more they criticize, the more energetic they become, and the more in-depth they become.

Through the revolutionary criticism, the eyes of the broad masses are becoming brighter and brighter. Hidden class enemies are being exposed one by one, revealing their true faces. These exposed class enemies have become living teaching materials for criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev's theory of the "extinction of class struggle" in various places, making everyone receive a living class struggle education.

Insist on arming the broad peasantry with Mao Zedong Thought, and continuously consolidate and develop the socialist stronghold in the countryside.

The Xingguo County Revolutionary Committee believes that through in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm the broad peasant masses is the fundamental guarantee for continuously consolidating and developing the socialist stronghold in the countryside.

Based on this understanding, the county revolutionary committee began to lead the broad rural grassroots cadres and revolutionary masses to move in this direction. No matter how complicated rural work is, the first big thing they grasp is to learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought in practice, making Mao Zedong Thought take root in the hearts of the broad peasants. Now, the mass movement of learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought in practice has reached a new high tide. Various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes have sprung up like bamboo shoots after a rain, totaling more than 14,000 classes so far, with 326,000 people participating in the study. Many poor and lower-middle peasants said: "This is the best classroom for learning Mao Zedong Thought, the best battlefield for criticizing and repudiating revisionism, and the best place for self-education. After entering the study class, listening to Chairman Mao's words, the heart is clearer, the eyes are brighter, and the direction is clearer when walking."

In leading the revolutionary criticism movement, the Xingguo County Revolutionary Committee also focused on setting up models and promoting the banners of advanced struggles in the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines. The three banners of Changgang Brigade in Changgang Commune, Shangshe Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and Yongfeng Commune's Jiaoxi Brigade, which is in the style of Dazhai, have become examples for the broad rural areas of the entire county to learn from. At the same time, the activities of "one helps one" and "one red pair" are also being gradually carried out among the masses. All of these are powerfully promoting the thought revolutionization of the people. The people of Xingguo, with a glorious revolutionary tradition, are clear in their hatred and firm in their stance, and are advancing more firmly in the waves of class struggle towards the direction indicated by Chairman Mao!

    用毛泽东思想武装的广大群众向中国赫鲁晓夫和一切阶级敌人猛烈进攻
   兴国县农村革命大批判的烈火越烧越旺
   苦大仇深的贫下中农站在最前线，三十多万革命群众积极投入这一斗争。隐藏的阶级敌人一个个被挖了出来。这些被挖出的阶级敌人，又成为批判中国赫鲁晓夫“阶级斗争熄灭”论的活教材
    据新华社南昌二十三日电　无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的江西省兴国县广大革命群众，牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，对以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大一小撮走资派以及社会上的一切牛鬼蛇神，展开了持续的大揭发、大批判、大斗争。革命大批判的熊熊烈火，燃遍了全县广大农村。
    在这里，不管是田头、屋场，还是贫下中农的家庭，处处都是革命大批判的战场。在这里，不管是五六岁的孩子，还是白发苍苍的老人，都知道中国赫鲁晓夫是贫下中农的死对头。这里的人民群众充分发动起来了。在广大贫下中农心目中，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的观念十分鲜明。他们说，“社会主义是光明大道，资本主义是死路一条”。他们坚决表示：翻身不忘共产党，幸福不忘毛主席，永远跟着毛主席革命到底。
   克服右倾保守思想，率领广大群众  持续地深入地开展革命大批判
    兴国县的革命大批判运动，是在县革命委员会的领导下开展起来的。县革委会认为，能不能率领广大群众向阶级敌人主动进攻，从政治上、思想上、理论上把中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大一小撮走资派彻底斗倒斗臭，是关系到夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大事，是关系到巩固无产阶级革命政权的根本大事。县革委会于去年底成立之后，立即深入农村，对大批判的情况作了全面检查。
    检查的情况说明，革命委员会成立以后，不少地方不是把大批判抓得更紧，而是露出了放松对敌斗争的苗头。有些基层组织的干部认为，贫下中农掌了权，阶级敌人都低下脑袋走路了，就是有几条泥鳅，也翻不了大船。县革命委员会十分重视这一情况，他们认为，有了这种思想，就会失去阶级警惕性，看不见敌情；不去主动率领群众开展革命大批判，同阶级敌人进行斗争，就会给一小撮阶级敌人在农村搞资本主义复辟活动以可乘之机。
    县革委会雷厉风行地组织各级干部，认真学习毛主席关于阶级斗争的教导，集中地向全体干部进行了关于保卫无产阶级革命政权的教育。各地还普遍分析了阶级斗争的形势，揭发了阶级敌人煽动群众搞分田到户、拆队单干、滥伐森林等破坏社会主义集体经济的种种罪行。通过这些教育，使大家进一步认识到，当前阶级斗争仍然是尖锐复杂的，斗争的焦点仍然集中在资本主义复辟和无产阶级反复辟的问题上，集中在巩固无产阶级专政与颠覆无产阶级政权的斗争上。他们又下去听贫下中农的反映，有的老贫农拿出了毛主席当年土地革命时期的语录念给干部听：“革命的阶级——工农劳苦群众，用苏维埃这个武器去对付内外一切反革命，这就是苏维埃第一个作用。”老贫农恳切地对干部说：“可不要忘了毛主席对咱老区人民的教导啊！你们为无产阶级掌权，要不拿政权这个武器去对付敌人，就太糊涂了。”贫农的话，更深刻地教育了干部。在这个基础上，各基层组织都回忆了革命先辈为夺取政权和保卫无产阶级的政权而出生入死流血牺牲的情况，大大提高了大家对抓阶级斗争、抓革命大批判的认识。大家一致提出：为保卫无产阶级的革命政权，一定要把阶级斗争抓到底，把革命大批判进行到底。
  革命大批判必须坚定不移地依靠贫下中农
    在县革委会的统一组织下，全县各地普遍举办了培养开展革命大批判骨干的毛泽东思想学习班。他们从各生产队挑选苦大仇深、坚定走社会主义道路、在群众中有威望的贫下中农参加学习。这些骨干进一步用毛泽东思想武装起来以后，不仅带头站在斗争的最前线，而且采取了许多措施来广泛发动群众。他们和群众一起大摆阶级斗争的事实，查阶级敌人进行资本主义复辟活动的危害，控诉中国赫鲁晓夫的滔天罪行。他们还和群众一道大讲家史、村史，忆苦思甜，进行群众性的阶级教育，大大提高了广大群众的阶级斗争觉悟和路线斗争觉悟。全县三十多万革命人民更加紧密地团结起来，向着中国赫鲁晓夫和一切阶级敌人展开猛烈进攻，革命大批判的烈火越烧越旺。
        抓住主要矛盾，集中火力，
      打一场持续的“人民战争”
    毛主席最近极其深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”兴国县革委会深深认识到：中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大一小撮走资派，是国民党反动派即资产阶级和地、富、反、坏、右的利益的总代表，他们所推行的反革命修正主义路线的流毒很深很广，必须率领广大革命群众，集中火力，打一场持续的“人民战争”，把革命大批判进行到底。他们采取的做法是，紧紧抓住中国赫鲁晓夫在农村推行的一整套反革命修正主义谬论，结合当地阶级斗争实际，集中火力，彻底批判。如结合阶级敌人煽动群众拆散生产队、鼓吹副业单干，集中批判中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派“三自一包”的谬论；结合阶级敌人煽动破坏国家计划，集中批判一小撮走资派“四大自由”的谬论；结合斗争没有改造好的地富分子，集中批判“剥削有功”的谬论；结合分配，集中批判“物质刺激”的谬论等等。这样做，使大批判的内容更丰富，也更加深入。埠头公社蕉田生产队的阶级敌人暗中煽动群众分队。在开展革命大批判后，贫农下中农和全队社员群众一齐揭穿了地富分子的这一破坏活动，使大家认识到分队就是走中国赫鲁晓夫“三自一包”的资本主义道路。大家说，中国赫鲁晓夫要让我们走回头路，受二遍苦，绝对办不到。我们跟毛主席走社会主义的光明大道走定了。龙冈、江背、崇贤等公社在批判“三自一包”的谬论时，社员群众纷纷起来大诉“三自一包”的苦，大揭中国赫鲁晓夫的罪行。一些受阶级敌人煽动想搞副业单干的社员，都自觉地纠正了自己的错误。长冈公社仁塘大队的社员群众结合分配，狠批了“物质刺激”、“工分挂帅”的谬论。他们说，中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派的“物质刺激”、“工分挂帅”，是一把杀人不见血的软刀子。他们就是想用这把软刀子把农民走社会主义道路的积极性统统砍掉，为复辟资本主义开道。埠头公社垓上大队社员们抓住“是为赚钱多种西瓜，还是按国家计划多种水稻”这个典型事例，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫的“四大自由”。社员们学习了毛主席“我们作计划、办事、想问题，都要从我国有六亿人口这一点出发”的教导，认识到多种几亩西瓜还是多种几亩水稻，这不是小事情，而是走那条道路的大问题。他们说，图利赚钱，搞经营自由，就是跟中国赫鲁晓夫走资本主义道路；从六亿人口出发，按国家计划办事，才能一心走社会主义的大道。
    兴国县广大革命群众就是这样，事事以两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争为纲，发现一个问题，深入展开一场大批判，越批越有劲，越批越深入。
    通过革命的大批判，广大群众的眼睛越来越亮。隐藏的阶级敌人一个个被撕掉画皮，暴露出了他们的真面目。这些被挖出来的阶级敌人，又成了各地批判中国赫鲁晓夫“阶级斗争熄灭”论的活教材，使大家受到活生生的阶级斗争的教育。
      坚持用毛泽东思想武装广大农民的头
    脑，不断巩固和发展农村的社会主义阵地
    兴国县革命委员会认为，通过深入持久地开展革命大批判，用毛泽东思想把广大农民群众武装起来，这是不断巩固和发展农村社会主义阵地的根本保证。
    根据这个认识，县革委会开始领导广大农村基层干部和革命群众朝着这个方向迈进。不论农村工作怎样千头万绪，他们抓的第一项大事就是活学活用毛泽东思想，使毛泽东思想在广大农民心里扎根。现在，全县活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动出现了新高潮。各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班如雨后春笋般开办起来，到目前为止已经办了学习班一万四千多期，有三十二万六千多人次参加了学习。许多贫下中农说：“这是学习毛泽东思想的最好课堂，斗私批修的最好战场，自己教育自己的最好地方。进了学习班，听了毛主席的话，心更明，眼更亮，走起路来就更有方向。”
    兴国县革命委员会在领导革命大批判运动中，还大抓典型，大树在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争中的先进旗帜。长冈公社长冈大队、上社供销社和大寨式的永丰公社焦溪大队三面旗帜，已经成了全县广大农村学习的榜样。与此同时，在群众中“一帮一”、“一对红”的活动，也正在逐步开展起来。所有这些，都正在有力地促进着人的思想革命化。富有光荣革命传统的兴国人民，爱憎分明，立场坚定，在阶级斗争的风浪里，正在更加坚定地朝着毛主席指引的方向胜利前进！
