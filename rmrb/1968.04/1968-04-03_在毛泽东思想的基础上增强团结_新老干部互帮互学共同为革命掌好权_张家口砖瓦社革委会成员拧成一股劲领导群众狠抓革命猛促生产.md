In the spirit of Mao Zedong Thought, the new and old cadres of the Zhangjiakou Brick and Tile Cooperative Revolutionary Committee have united as one, helping and learning from each other to jointly hold power for the revolution. They have led the masses to grasp the revolution and promote production.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Shijiazhuang on the 2nd, the new and old revolutionary cadres of the Zhangjiakou Brick and Tile Cooperative Revolutionary Committee, with the enthusiastic help of the People's Liberation Army's support-left personnel, have formed "red pairs," respecting each other, learning from each other, and complementing each other's strengths and weaknesses. They have united as one, making the revolutionary committee a true battle command center with proletarian revolutionary authority in leading the broad revolutionary masses to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

After the establishment of the revolutionary committee of the Zhangjiakou Brick and Tile Cooperative, it resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions, leading all revolutionary workers in the cooperative to grasp the revolution and promote production, thereby powerfully advancing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the unit. However, in the process of work, some problems were exposed among some members of the revolutionary committee: some old cadres were afraid of making mistakes again and hesitated in the face of issues, while on the other hand, they felt that new cadres were inexperienced and clumsy in their work, and they couldn't stand it; some new cadres felt that old cadres had too many rigid frameworks and lacked vitality. There was a lack of mutual trust between new and old cadres.

After the supporting-left soldiers of the Brick and Tile Cooperative discovered this problem, they immediately assisted the revolutionary committee in organizing a study class on Mao Zedong Thought, attended by members of the revolutionary committee and some workers. They organized everyone to seriously study Chairman Mao's series of instructions on cadre issues and his teachings on cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. They mobilized everyone to take "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the key, linking it to the new situation and tasks of class struggle, to thoroughly discuss the harm of mutual disrespect between new and old cadres, to deeply excavate the roots of mutual distrust, and to extensively talk about the profound significance of unity between new and old cadres. Chairman Mao teaches us: "If our party does not have a large number of new cadres cooperating with old cadres, our cause will be interrupted." Through study, they realized that whether or not to strengthen the unity between new and old cadres is a major issue related to whether or not to hold and use power for the proletariat, and this issue must be seriously addressed. On the basis of raising awareness, new and old revolutionary cadres used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fiercely combat the "self" in their minds, conducted strict self-criticism, and decided to strengthen unity on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought's principles, so that the revolutionary committee could further play a revolutionary role in leading the revolutionary masses to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Next, the supporting-left personnel from the army helped them carry out reminiscence and sweetness activities, further arousing proletarian feelings between new and old cadres, and through introducing the army's experience in carrying out the "one helps one, one red pair" activities, they acted as matchmakers, making new and old cadres form "red pairs."

In the course of carrying out the "red pair" activities, new and old revolutionary cadres followed Chairman Mao's great teaching that "new and old cadres should respect each other, learn from each other, complement each other's strengths and weaknesses, so as to unite as one and carry out a common cause." They learned from each other and helped each other. Old cadres continuously shared their experiences and lessons with new cadres, guiding new cadres to advance along the path indicated by Chairman Mao. New cadres also continuously reflected the opinions and demands of the masses to old cadres, helping old cadres overcome shortcomings and errors, and keeping up with the situation. Once, the revolutionary leading cadre and the head of the revolutionary committee, Hu Yuzhen, discovered that the original leader of the mass organization and deputy head of the revolutionary committee, Li Yushan, did not listen to different opinions. During a meeting, because someone's opinion did not suit his intentions, he left the meeting. Hu Yuzhen immediately had a heart-to-heart talk with him and used her own painful lesson of committing errors due to being detached from the masses and not listening to different opinions to help him, making him quickly raise his awareness and gradually overcome his shortcomings. The old cadre in charge of production, Yu Zhishan, saw that some workers, influenced by anarchist thoughts, did not observe labor discipline, and he was anxious, planning to establish rules and regulations to control them. After he shared his thoughts with two new cadres, the new cadres studied Chairman Mao's teaching that "grasping ideological education is the central link for uniting the whole party to engage in great political struggles" with Yu Zhishan, and sincerely told him that we should first grasp the fundamentals, the ideological revolution of the people. When the masses grasp Mao Zedong Thought, they will manage themselves, and production will naturally be in order. Otherwise, no matter how good the regulations are, they will be of no use. The new cadres' words deeply moved Yu Zhishan, and he expressed his determination to learn from the new cadres and take the road of emphasizing proletarian politics.

Now, the members of the revolutionary committee not only help and learn from each other but also support and care for each other. When encountering arduous work, new cadres take on the heavy burden; if new cadres do something that aligns with Mao Zedong Thought, old cadres give full support, and if there are mistakes due to improper work methods, old cadres take responsibility. New and old cadres unite as one, combining their efforts, making the revolution in the entire cooperative vigorous and production rising day by day, with daily output increasing by 30 percent compared to before.

    在毛泽东思想的基础上增强团结
    新老干部互帮互学共同为革命掌好权
    张家口砖瓦社革委会成员拧成一股劲领导群众狠抓革命猛促生产
    据新华社石家庄二日电　张家口市砖瓦社革命委员会的新老革命干部，在人民解放军支左人员的热情帮助下，结成“一对红”，彼此尊重，互相学习，取长补短，团结一致，使革命委员会在领导广大革命群众落实毛主席的最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的斗争中，真正成为有无产阶级革命权威的战斗指挥部。
    张家口市砖瓦社的革命委员会成立后，坚决贯彻毛主席的最新指示，领导全社革命职工狠抓革命，猛促生产，有力地推动了本单位的无产阶级文化大革命运动。但在开展工作的过程中，也暴露了革委会部分成员的活思想：有的老干部怕再犯错误，遇事畏首畏尾，另一方面他们又觉得新干部在工作上毛手毛脚，缺乏经验，有点看不惯；有的新干部就觉得老干部框框多，没朝气。新老干部之间存在着互不信任的现象。
    在砖瓦社支左的解放军同志发现这个问题后，当即协助革命委员会举办了有革委会成员和部分工人参加的毛泽东思想学习班，组织大家认真学习毛主席有关干部问题的一系列指示和关于培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的教导，发动大家以“斗私，批修”为纲，联系阶级斗争的新形势和新任务，大摆新老干部互不尊重的危害，大挖互不信任的根子，大谈新老干部团结一致的深远意义。毛主席教导我们：“我们党如果没有广大的新干部同老干部一致合作，我们的事业就会中断。”经过学习，他们认识到，能否搞好新老干部的团结，是关系到能否为无产阶级掌好权、用好权的大事，必须严肃对待这个问题。在提高认识的基础上，新老革命干部都以毛泽东思想为武器，狠斗自己头脑里的“私”字，作了严格的自我批评，决心在毛泽东思想的原则基础上，增强团结，使革委会在带领革命群众夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中，进一步发挥出革命作用。
    接着，部队支左人员又帮助他们开展忆苦思甜活动，进一步激发新老干部之间的无产阶级感情，并通过介绍部队开展“一帮一、一对红”活动的经验，为他们穿针引线，使新老干部结成“一对红”。
    在开展“一对红”活动中，新老革命干部遵照毛主席“新老干部应该是彼此尊重，互相学习，取长补短，以便团结一致，进行共同的事业”的伟大教导，互相学习，互相帮助。老干部不断向新干部讲述自己的经验教训，引导新干部沿着毛主席指引的方向阔步前进。新干部也不断向老干部反映群众的意见和要求，帮助老干部克服缺点、错误，跟上形势。一次，革命的领导干部、革委会主任胡玉珍发现原群众组织的负责人、革委会副主任李玉山听不进不同的意见，开会时因别人的意见不符合他的心意，就退出了会场。胡玉珍便及时找他谈心，并用自己以前因脱离群众，听不进不同意见而犯错误的沉痛教训帮助他，使他很快提高了认识，逐步克服了缺点。负责管生产的老干部芋治山，看到有的工人因受无政府主义思潮的影响不遵守劳动纪律，心里着急，打算搞个规章制度卡住。当他把自己的想法给两个新干部谈了之后，新干部就和芋治山一起学习毛主席“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节”的教导，并诚恳地对他说，咱们要抓的首先是根本，是人的思想革命化，群众掌握了毛泽东思想，自己就会管理自己，生产自然就有秩序了。否则，制度订的再好也没用。新干部的一席话，使芋治山很受感动，他表示决心向新干部学习，走突出无产阶级政治的道路。
    现在，这个社的革委会成员之间不仅能互相帮助，互相学习，而且能互相支持，互相关心。遇到艰苦的工作，新干部就争挑重担；新干部干的事情，只要符合毛泽东思想，老干部就大力支持，如果因工作方法不当而出了差错，老干部就主动承担责任。新老干部团结一条心，拧成一股劲，全社革命搞得轰轰烈烈，生产节节上升，日产量比过去提高了百分之三十。
