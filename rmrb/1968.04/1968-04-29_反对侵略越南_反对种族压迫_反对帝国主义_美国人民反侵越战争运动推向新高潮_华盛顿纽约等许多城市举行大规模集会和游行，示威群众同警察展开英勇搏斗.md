Following the unprecedented scale of black anti-violence struggles, a massive anti-Vietnam War protest movement by the American people has rapidly unfolded across the country, further besieging the already beleaguered and breathless American reactionary ruling clique.

In this struggle, the American people have raised the slogans of opposing the Vietnam War and racial discrimination, thereby more closely linking the broad anti-Vietnam War movement of the American people with the struggle for black liberation.

On the 26th, students from many schools in New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Georgia, Ohio, and California simultaneously held strikes. In New York City alone, tens of thousands of students from dozens of colleges and high schools participated in strikes, demonstrations, and various rallies to protest the U.S. imperialist invasion of Vietnam and its policy of racial discrimination against blacks.

Students from Columbia University, both white and black, have been staging sit-ins since the 23rd to oppose the Vietnam War and racial oppression, demanding that a "scientific research institution" serving the Vietnam War be removed from Columbia University. Despite the surveillance and threats from a large number of police and plainclothes officers, the students occupied four main buildings on campus, rendering the entire school unable to conduct classes.

On the 26th, as the sit-in entered its fourth day, black youth leaders Brown and Carmichael arrived at Columbia University to support the students' just actions.

On the 23rd, in Oakland, California, 1,500 people held a demonstration and march against the Vietnam War and conscription. The demonstrators engaged in a fierce struggle with the armed police.

According to a report from the 28th, following the large-scale student strikes across the United States on the 26th to oppose the U.S. imperialist invasion of Vietnam, major cities including Washington, New York, and Chicago held large-scale rallies and marches against the Vietnam War and racial oppression on the 27th, pushing the nationwide movement that had been unfolding over the past two days to a new high. In some places, demonstrators, undeterred by violence, engaged in fierce struggles with the police and thugs sent to suppress and disrupt the demonstrations. The scale of the anti-war demonstrations in New York City was the largest. Representatives from 150 unions, student groups, anti-war organizations, and religious groups, totaling over 100,000 people, regardless of race, gender, or age, marched through the city's main streets and then gathered in Central Park to demand an end to the Vietnam War and racial oppression at home. They held up anti-war banners as wide as the streets and chanted slogans such as "No more cannon fodder in Vietnam" and "Johnson is a murderer."

In Washington Square Park in New York City's Greenwich Village, a large crowd held up the red and blue flags of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the flag of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, shouting the clear slogan "Oppose Imperialism." When they attempted to leave the park to march through the streets, the police, citing "unauthorized march" as a pretext, blocked their path, leading to a fierce struggle. According to reports, over 100 demonstrators were arrested during the struggle. Two 16-year-old youths were also unjustly arrested by the police for burning an American flag. Some demonstrators, as they were being beaten and dragged into police vans, still shouted angrily at these reactionaries, "You fascists!"

At the large-scale rally in New York City's Central Park, a black veteran pointed out sharply in his speech that those who wage the Vietnam War are the same people who oppress blacks in the United States. American blacks are increasingly awakening; they want to fight for their own freedom and not against the Vietnamese people. At the rally, demonstrators fought against thugs sent to disrupt and sabotage the demonstration.

In America's second-largest city, Chicago, a 5,000-strong demonstration marched towards the city center square and broke through the police blockade around the square. The police sprayed a toxic chemical agent to suppress the demonstrators, who used placards as weapons to fight back, injuring the police chief of Chicago's first precinct.

In the U.S. capital, Washington, despite the rain, hundreds of demonstrators, led by a 15-year-old drummer, marched from a park near the White House to the local draft board office to oppose conscription and protest the Vietnam War.

In Los Angeles, more than 2,000 anti-Vietnam War demonstrators held up banners opposing the Vietnam War and racial oppression, chanting slogans against going to Vietnam to fight for American imperialism.

In cities such as Philadelphia, San Francisco, Boston, Cleveland, Seattle, and Pittsburgh, demonstrations and marches of varying scales were also held.

    反对侵略越南　反对种族压迫　反对帝国主义
    美国人民反侵越战争运动推向新高潮
    华盛顿纽约等许多城市举行大规模集会和游行，示威群众同警察展开英勇搏斗
    据新华社二十七日讯　华盛顿消息：紧接着规模空前的黑人抗暴斗争之后，一个声势浩大的美国人民反对美帝侵越战争的抗议运动又在美国各地迅速展开，使已经焦头烂额、喘息未定的美国反动统治集团又陷入了广大人民的重重包围。
    在这次斗争中，美国人民喊出的口号是，反对侵越战争，反对种族歧视，从而把广泛的美国人民反对侵越战争的运动和黑人争取解放的斗争更紧密地联系在一起。
    二十六日，纽约、康涅狄格、马萨诸塞、佐治亚、俄亥俄和加利福尼亚等州许多学校的学生同时举行了罢课。仅在纽约市，就有几十所大专院校和中学的数万名学生参加了罢课、示威和各种集会，抗议美帝侵越战争和对黑人的种族歧视政策。
    哥伦比亚大学的许多白人和黑人学生从二十三日起就开始了静坐示威，反对侵越战争和种族压迫，要求一个为侵越战争服务的国防部“科学研究机构”撤离哥伦比亚大学。学生们不顾大批警察和便衣的监视和威吓，占据了校园内的四所主要楼房，使得整个学校不能上课。
    二十六日，当静坐示威进入第四天的时候，美国黑人青年领导人布朗和卡迈克尔来到哥伦比亚大学校园支持学生们的正义行动。
    二十三日，在加利福尼亚州的奥克兰，一千五百人举行了反对侵越战争，反对征兵的示威游行。示威者同武装警察进行了英勇的搏斗。
    据新华社二十八日讯　华盛顿消息：继二十六日美国各地学生为反对美帝侵越战争举行大罢课之后，包括华盛顿、纽约、芝加哥等地在内的美国许多重要城市，二十七日又举行了大规模的抗议侵越战争和种族压迫的游行和集会，把两天来全国范围内掀起的这次群众运动推向新的高潮。一些地方的示威者不畏强暴，同派去镇压他们的警察和破坏示威的流氓进行了英勇的搏斗。纽约市的抗议示威规模最大。代表一百五十个工会、学生、反战和宗教团体的十多万群众，不分白人、黑人、男女老少，在全市主要街道上举行游行示威，然后到中央公园举行集会，要求结束侵越战争和在国内的种族压迫。他们高举着同街道一样宽的巨幅反战标语，并且高呼不去越南当炮灰和谴责约翰逊是杀人犯的口号。
    在纽约市格林威治村的华盛顿广场公园，大批群众高举着越南南方民族解放阵线的红蓝两色旗帜和越南民主共和国国旗举行示威，他们愤怒地提出了“反对帝国主义”的鲜明口号。当他们要离开公园上街游行的时候，警察以“游行未经许可”为借口，拦住他们的去路，发生一场激烈的搏斗。据报道，在搏斗中有一百多名示威群众被捕。两名十六岁的青年因焚烧一面美国国旗，也遭警察无理逮捕。有的示威者在被警察拳打脚踢地拖上囚车的时候，还向这些反动家伙愤怒地高呼“你们这些法西斯！”
    在纽约市中央公园举行的大规模群众集会上，一个黑人退伍军人在发言中尖锐地指出，进行侵越战争的人也就是在美国压迫黑人的人。美国黑人已日益觉醒，他们要为自己的自由而战，而不要对越南人民作战。在集会上，示威群众同派去进行捣乱、破坏示威的流氓进行了斗争。
    在美国第二大城市芝加哥，五千人的一支示威队伍浩浩荡荡走向市中心广场，并且冲破了警察在广场周围设置的封锁线。警察喷射一种毒性化学药剂镇压示威者，示威者用标语牌作为武器英勇还击，把芝加哥市第一警区的警察头子打伤。
    在美国首都华盛顿，尽管下着雨，数百名示威者由一个十五岁的鼓手引导着从白宫附近的一个公园游行到征兵局分局所在地，反对征兵，抗议侵越战争。
    洛杉矶的两千多名反对侵越战争的示威者，举着反对侵越战争，反对种族压迫的标语牌，高呼着不去越南为美帝国主义卖命的口号举行了游行示威。
    在费城、旧金山、波士顿、克利夫兰、西雅图、匹兹堡等重要城市也举行了规模不等的示威游行。
