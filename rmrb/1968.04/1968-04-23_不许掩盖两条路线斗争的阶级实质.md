The other major capitalist-roader within the Party, in collusion with the Chinese Khrushchev, tries every means to conceal the class essence of the struggle between the two lines, claiming that the struggle between the two lines within the Party is merely a question of "building socialism quickly or slowly." This is a thoroughly reactionary revisionist fallacy.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us that the struggle between the two lines within the Party is the "reflection of class contradictions within the Party." The history of our Party's struggle between the two lines over the past decades has proven this point, and the facts of the struggle between the two lines within our factory have also proven this point.

Our Foreign Language Printing Plant is tasked with the glorious mission of propagating Mao Zedong Thought to the revolutionary peoples of the world. Oppressed nations and peoples around the world eagerly await Chairman Mao's precious works to study the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought. However, the Chinese Khrushchev and the other major capitalist-roader within the Party collude to fiercely oppose the publication of Chairman Mao's works in foreign languages, suppressing, obstructing, and delaying the printing of Chairman Mao's works. On the contrary, to promote the reactionary revisionist line and strangle the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world, they print and distribute in large quantities the infamous "Self-Cultivation," and are particularly eager to prepare the collection of works by the Chinese Khrushchev to oppose Chairman Mao's brilliant works. During that period, imperial, feudal, and bourgeois trash such as "Li Huiniang," "Red Sun," and "Guan Hanqing" flooded our factory's foreign language publications, while foreign language editions of Chairman Mao's works were printed in very small quantities, far from meeting the urgent needs of the revolutionary peoples of the world.

We must ask the other major capitalist-roader within the Party: Is your fierce opposition to the publication of Chairman Mao's brilliant works merely a question of printing more or fewer books? Is it merely a question of publishing foreign language editions of Chairman Mao's works quickly or slowly? No, absolutely not! This is not a question of speed, but a question of fiercely opposing our great leader Chairman Mao, a question of fiercely opposing the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and a question of fiercely opposing the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world. Implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line means printing more and better foreign language editions of Chairman Mao's works, sending the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to the revolutionary peoples of the world, and guiding them to victory in their revolutionary struggles. Implementing the reactionary revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev means suppressing the publication of Chairman Mao's works and allowing bourgeois and revisionist thoughts to poison the revolutionary peoples of the world, dooming their revolutionary cause. This is the struggle between the two lines within our factory, and it is also the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses of our factory seized power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought illuminated the Foreign Language Printing Plant. We printing workers, with boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to Chairman Mao, with our hearts in our country and our eyes on the world, printed large quantities of various foreign language editions of Chairman Mao's works. In just one year, 1967, we printed 24 languages and 333 editions of Chairman Mao's works, totaling 9.4 million copies, exceeding the total number of Chairman Mao's works printed since the founding of the factory. In addition, we printed 487 types of Cultural Revolution books and foreign language periodicals, totaling nearly 24 million copies. This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We must always remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticize and expose the Chinese Khrushchev and the other major capitalist-roader within the Party, eliminate all their poisonous influences, and turn our Foreign Language Printing Plant into a red bastion for propagating Mao Zedong Thought to the world.

    不许掩盖两条路线斗争的阶级实质
    外文印刷厂工人　费元生　钟秋江
    党内另一个最大的走资派，同中国赫鲁晓夫一唱一和，百般掩盖两条路线斗争的阶级实质，胡说什么党内两条路线斗争，是“建设社会主义快和慢的问题”。这是彻头彻尾的反革命修正主义的谬论。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们，党内两条路线的斗争，是“阶级矛盾对于党内的反映”。我们党几十年来两条路线斗争的历史证明了这一点，我们厂内两条路线斗争的事实也证明了这一点。
    我们外文印刷厂担负着向世界革命人民宣传毛泽东思想的光荣任务。全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民，都渴望得到毛主席的宝书，学习伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想。但是，中国赫鲁晓夫和党内另一个最大的走资派串通一气，疯狂反对出版外文版毛主席著作，百般压制、阻挠、拖延毛主席著作的印刷。相反，他们为了推行反革命修正主义路线，扼杀世界人民的革命斗争，却大量印刷发行臭名远扬的《修养》，还特别卖力地准备出中国赫鲁晓夫的文集，同毛主席的光辉著作相对抗。在那个时期，帝王将相，才子佳人，风花雪月等封建主义、资本主义的货色，什么《李慧娘》、《红日》、《关汉卿》等大毒草，充塞了我厂印刷的外文书刊，而毛主席著作外文版，却印得很少很少，远远不能满足世界革命人民的迫切需要。
    我们要质问党内另一个最大的走资派，你们拚命反对出版毛主席的光辉著作，仅仅是多印几本书和少印几本书的问题吗？仅仅是出版外文版毛主席著作快一些和慢一些的问题吗？不是，绝对不是！这绝不是一个快和慢的问题，而是疯狂反对我们伟大领袖毛主席的大问题，是疯狂反对战无不胜的毛泽东思想的大问题，是疯狂反对世界人民的革命斗争的大问题。执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就是要把毛主席著作外文版出多出好，给世界革命人民送去战无不胜的毛泽东思想，指导他们赢得革命斗争的胜利。执行中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线，就要压制毛主席著作的出版，而让资产阶级、修正主义思想毒害世界革命人民，断送他们的革命事业。这就是我们厂里两条路线的斗争，也是无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级的斗争。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我厂无产阶级革命派夺了厂里党内一小撮走资派的权，战无不胜的毛泽东思想照亮了外文印刷厂。我们印刷工人怀着对毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的心情，胸怀祖国，放眼世界，大量印制各种外文版毛主席著作。只一九六七年一年，就印制了二十四种文版的毛主席著作三百三十三种，九百四十余万册，超过建厂以来印制的毛主席著作的总和。此外，还印刷文化大革命书籍及外文期刊四百八十七种，近两千四百万册。这是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。我们一定要牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，高举革命批判大旗，把中国赫鲁晓夫和党内另一个最大的走资派批倒批臭，肃清他们的一切流毒，把我们外文印刷厂办成红彤彤的对外宣传毛泽东思想的阵地。
