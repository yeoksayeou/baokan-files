In the guidance of Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and with the great assistance of the People's Liberation Army, the revolution in the rural areas of Liaoning Province is booming, and production is thriving. Everywhere, a prosperous and flourishing scene is unfolding.

Navigation at sea relies on the helmsman, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, militiamen, and revolutionary cadres in the rural areas of Liaoning Province, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, are implementing Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day." They follow Chairman Mao's instruction that "holding study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes." They have vigorously held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. So far, the province has held over 240,000 sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with over 7.8 million participants. Many places have also set up "small classrooms" at home. Through the active learning and application of Mao Zedong Thought, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have greatly deepened their proletarian feelings of being loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

In conjunction with the revolutionary criticism, the "Four Remembrances and Four Never Forgets" activities have been widely carried out, which are: remembering the hardships of one's family history, never forgetting Chairman Mao's leadership in liberating the laboring people; remembering one's personal growth and progress, never forgetting Chairman Mao's nurturing; remembering the history of the Chinese revolution and the world revolutionary struggle, never forgetting Chairman Mao's great achievements; remembering the great achievements of the socialist revolution and socialist construction, never forgetting the great power of Mao Zedong Thought. Many places in the province have also held hardship meals, hardship meetings, sung hardship songs, and performed hardship plays, adopting various forms to conduct class education. The class education of remembering hardships and thinking of sweetness has promoted the further deepening of the revolutionary criticism. At present, the revolutionary criticism battlefields are set up everywhere in the rural areas of the province. Whether it is young and strong community members, or elderly people with white hair, or children who have just grown up, everyone joins the battle. They are conducting a comprehensive and systematic criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line advocated by China's Khrushchev and his agents in Northeast China and Liaoning Province. Through the revolutionary criticism, the class struggle and line struggle awareness of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have been further heightened, and the revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination have been consolidated and developed. Now, nearly 90% of the communes, towns, and farms in the province have established revolutionary committees. The new leading cadres at the county, commune, and brigade levels are leading the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in a fighting posture to launch a fierce attack on the class enemies.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the province have directed the revolutionary enthusiasm released in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to production, determined to achieve an even greater harvest in agricultural production this year on the basis of last year's bumper harvest. They resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production" and "learn from Dazhai in agriculture," taking Dazhai as an example, setting high aspirations, and launching a mass movement to follow the Dazhai path, learn from Dazhai people, and promote the Dazhai spirit. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, with a heart for the motherland and an eye on the world, to further establish the idea of farming for revolution. This year, the spring plowing production in the province started early and was well-prepared. The vast majority of production teams have achieved the selection of high-quality seeds and full fertilization. The province's wheat and sorghum have been planted, and currently, the general plowing and planting of large fields are being carried out, achieving timely sowing and no violation of agricultural time. While carrying out spring plowing production, spring afforestation and agricultural basic construction are also being carried out on a large scale. In drought-prone and waterlogged areas, rivers and irrigation ditches have been repaired, and the ability to resist drought and waterlogging has been strengthened. The broad masses of community members have put forward the fighting slogan of relying on Mao Zedong Thought to fight against nature, ensuring full seedlings without spring rain, and ensuring a bumper harvest without rain throughout the year, determined to contribute all their strength to achieving an even greater harvest in agricultural production this year.

    新华社沈阳二十七日电　在毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，在人民解放军的大力帮助下，辽宁省广大农村革命搞得轰轰烈烈，生产热气腾腾，到处呈现出一派欣欣向荣的大好景象。
    大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。辽宁省农村广大贫下中农、民兵和革命干部，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神落实毛主席的一系列最新指示。他们遵照毛主席关于“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决”的教导，大力举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。到目前为止，全省已举办毛泽东思想学习班二十四万多期，参加学习的达七百八十多万人。许多地方还办起了家庭“小课堂”。广大贫下中农通过活学活用毛泽东思想，大大加深了无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的无产阶级感情。
    各地结合革命大批判，普遍开展了
  “四忆四不忘”活动，即：忆家庭的苦难史，不忘毛主席领导劳动人民翻身得解放；忆个人成长进步史，不忘毛主席的培养；忆中国革命和世界革命斗争史，不忘毛主席的伟大功勋；忆社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大成就，不忘毛泽东思想的巨大威力。全省许多地方还吃忆苦饭，开忆苦会，唱忆苦歌，演忆苦戏，采取各种形式，进行阶级教育。忆苦思甜的阶级教育，推动了革命大批判进一步深入展开。目前，全省农村，到处摆开了革命大批判的战场。无论是青壮年社员，还是白发苍苍的老人，或是刚懂事的儿童，一齐上阵，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在东北和辽宁地区的代理人所推行的反革命修正主义路线，展开了全面、系统的大批判。通过革命的大批判，进一步提高了广大贫下中农的阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟，巩固和发展了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。现在，全省农村已有将近百分之九十的公社、镇、农场建立了革命委员会。县、公社、大队的新的领导班子正在以战斗的姿态领导广大贫下中农向阶级敌人展开猛烈的进攻。
    全省广大贫下中农把在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的革命干劲，用到生产上，决心在去年农业生产丰收的基础上，夺取今年农业生产更大的丰收。他们坚决贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”和“农业学大寨”的伟大号召，以大寨为榜样，树雄心，立大志，掀起了走大寨路、学大寨人、兴大寨风的群众性的热潮。广大贫下中农决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，胸怀祖国，放眼世界，进一步树立为革命种田的思想。今年全省的春耕生产动手早，准备得好，绝大多数的社队已经做到了精选良种，地施满肥。全省小麦、谷子已经种完，目前正在普遍开犁种大田，做到了适时播种，不违农时。在春耕生产的同时，还大搞春季植树造林和农田基本建设，干旱和易涝地区整修了河道和排灌沟渠，加强了抗旱防涝的能力。广大社员豪迈地提出了靠毛泽东思想战天斗地，一春无雨保全苗，一年无雨保丰收的战斗口号，决心为夺取今年农业生产的更大丰收贡献一切力量。
