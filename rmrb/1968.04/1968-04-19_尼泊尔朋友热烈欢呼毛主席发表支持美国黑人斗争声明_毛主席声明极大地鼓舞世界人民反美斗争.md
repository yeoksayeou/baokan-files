Nepalese friends warmly hail the great leader Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence. They point out that this statement has greatly encouraged the just struggle of the peoples of the world against U.S. imperialism.

The chairman of the Nepal Asia-Africa Solidarity Committee, Purna Bahadur, issued a statement on the 17th saying: Chairman Mao Zedong's statement has given new encouragement to the struggle of the Vietnamese people and the struggle of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism and old and new colonialism headed by the United States. The current struggle of American blacks further confirms Chairman Mao's statement: "U.S. imperialism is the most vicious enemy of the peoples of the world."

The statement said: "American blacks not only have the broad support of the masses of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, but are also gaining increasing support from progressive people in the United States. The struggle currently being waged by American blacks in the United States is a great support for the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation struggle and the struggle of the peoples of other countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism and old and new colonialism headed by the United States. Imperialism and colonialism headed by the United States are facing increasing contradictions both at home and abroad. Their days are numbered. We support the just struggle of American blacks; they will surely win."

A cultural figure told a Xinhua News Agency correspondent: "Chairman Mao's statement of April 16 supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence will undoubtedly encourage and timely guide the just struggle of American blacks throughout the United States against the oppression of U.S. imperialism. This statement once again shows that Chairman Mao always stands at the forefront, supporting and guiding the just struggle of the oppressed peoples of the world for freedom and liberation."

A journalist said: "Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence has greatly encouraged the just struggle of the peoples of the world against U.S. imperialism. This statement is a very important document. It will push the struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism to a new stage."

    新华社加德满都十七日电　尼泊尔朋友热烈欢呼伟大领袖毛主席发表支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明，指出这个声明极大地鼓舞了全世界人民反对美帝国主义的正义斗争。
    尼泊尔亚非团结委员会主席普尔纳·巴哈杜尔十七日发表声明说：毛泽东主席的声明给予越南人民的斗争、亚非拉各国人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争以新的鼓舞。美国黑人目前的斗争，进一步证实了毛主席的这个论断：“美帝国主义是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人。”
    声明说：“美国黑人不仅得到亚非拉广大人民群众的广泛支持，而且正在得到美国进步人士越来越大的支持。目前美国黑人在美国进行的斗争，也是对越南人民的抗美救国斗争和亚非拉其他各国人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义的解放斗争的巨大支持。以美国为首的帝国主义和殖民主义在国内外面临着越来越大的矛盾。他们的日子已经不长了。我们支持美国黑人的正义斗争，他们必将获胜。”
    一位文艺界人士对新华社记者说：“毛主席四月十六日发表的支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明，无疑将鼓舞和及时指导在整个美国展开的美国黑人反对美帝国主义压迫的正义斗争。这个声明再次表明，毛主席总是站在最前线，支持和指导全世界被剥削人民争取自由和解放的正义斗争。”
    一位新闻工作者说：“毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明极大地鼓舞了全世界人民反对美帝国主义的正义斗争。这个声明是一个非常重要的文件。它将把反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争推向一个更新的阶段。”
