With the Red Sun in My Heart, Everything for Chairman Mao
—In Memory of the Heroic Soldier Liu Xuebao Who Defended the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution

“Look for heroes in this age, they are here today.”

In the midst of the triumphant songs of the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we introduce to you Liu Xuebao, a heroic soldier who defended the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat. Liu Xuebao is a deputy squad leader of the 3rd Platoon of a unit in the 8110th Division. With unwavering loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao and deep hatred for the class enemies, he single-handedly fought against counter-revolutionary elements, risked his life to save a bridge from exploding bombs, and created astonishing feats, composing another magnificent song of the new era of Mao Zedong Thought.

	Brave and Unyielding, Fearless in Battle

On December 17, 1967, the Revolutionary Committee of Yongdeng County was born in glory. The revolutionary situation in Yongdeng was excellent.

Liu Xuebao, who was supporting the left in the Yongdeng County Liancheng Experimental Forest Farm, was filled with excitement as he saw off the worker comrades who went to attend the founding and celebration meeting of the Yongdeng County Revolutionary Committee. He felt that today was particularly bright and warm. His heart soared towards Beijing, towards our great leader Chairman Mao. In his heart, he shouted: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand years!

“When the people rejoice, the counter-revolutionaries suffer.” “We must not relax our vigilance against the revenge plots of the imperialists and their running dogs.” Liu Xuebao remembered Chairman Mao’s great teachings and deeply understood that the class enemies would not voluntarily retire from the stage of history; they would still struggle desperately before their death. The closer we are to complete victory, the more we must heighten our revolutionary vigilance and guard against the sabotage activities of the class enemies. He vigilantly patrolled the courtyard of the forest farm.

In the evening, a shadow flashed out of the gate. Liu Xuebao took a closer look and saw that it was a historical counter-revolutionary from the forest farm. This former deputy platoon leader of the Nationalist Party’s Lanzhou City Garrison, who had bloodied his hands with the people’s blood before liberation, harbored extreme hatred for the dictatorship of the proletariat and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This guy, upon leaving the gate, walked straight along the highway towards the upstream of the Dutong River. Liu Xuebao looked at the mountains standing in the afterglow of the setting sun upstream of the Dutong River, where there were vast forests nurtured by the forest workers, and where there was a newly built bridge. He could not let the fruits of socialist construction suffer any loss, nor could he let the counter-revolutionaries’ plots succeed! Liu Xuebao immediately called Zhang Shilin from the forest farm, took a short knife and an axe, and ran to catch up.

The rising moon was obscured by the high mountains by the Dutong River, and through the faint moonlight, one could barely make out the winding road in the Dutong River valley. The counter-revolutionary hurriedly, sometimes darting through the brighter sections of the moonlight, sometimes crouching in the dark, sometimes turning his head to spy on his pursuer, sometimes running straight ahead. Liu Xuebao closely followed the counter-revolutionary, keeping a close watch on all his actions. Following the road, after about seven kilometers, the moonlight grew dimmer. The counter-revolutionary’s steps suddenly quickened, and after rounding a mountain bend, he disappeared. Where did he go? Not far from the road was the newly built bridge; further ahead was the great forest. Liu Xuebao estimated that this guy was either going to sabotage the bridge or sneak into the forest to set it on fire, or was making counter-revolutionary connections. The enemy had emerged, and this was a great opportunity to annihilate them. Liu Xuebao quietly told Zhang Shilin, “You quickly go back and call for reinforcements to catch the enemy in a net!” Zhang Shilin was concerned about Liu Xuebao’s safety and said, “Ahead is a deep, dense forest, it’s dangerous for you to go alone.” Liu Xuebao firmly replied, “Don’t worry about me. Revolutionaries are not afraid of death, those who are afraid of death are not revolutionaries, defending Chairman Mao, even if I die, I will die content.” He also instructed Zhang Shilin, “If the enemy goes into the mountains, I will leave my shoes, and you follow the direction of the toes of my shoes to chase!” As they parted, Zhang Shilin handed the axe to Liu Xuebao, “Old Liu, you must be extra careful!” Liu Xuebao immediately responded with Chairman Mao’s quotations, “Resolutely determined, not afraid of sacrifice…” Zhang Shilin continued, “Overcome all difficulties, strive for victory.”

Knowing there are tigers in the mountains, but still going into the tiger’s den. Liu Xuebao, with a heart full of loyalty to Chairman Mao, with great heroic spirit, continued to pursue the counter-revolutionary alone. Ahead was the bridge. The steep mountains on both sides squeezed the road and the Dutong River, making the terrain extremely treacherous. Suddenly, the counter-revolutionary ran towards him! Liu Xuebao roared, “Stop!” Before the words were out, a stone whizzed past Liu Xuebao’s right ear. Liu Xuebao took a step forward, trying to grab the counter-revolutionary. This Nationalist Party special agent, who had received special training, crouched down and pounced on Liu Xuebao like a wolf, hugging his legs and using his head and shoulders to push Liu Xuebao to the ground. Liu Xuebao remembered Chairman Mao’s great teachings: “This army has the spirit of advancing without fear of death, it will trample all enemies, and will never be subdued by the enemy.” Instantly, he gained boundless strength. He flipped over, using his iron-like right knee with the force of Mount Tai, pressing down on the counter-revolutionary’s chest, breaking four ribs.

On the other side of the bridge, there were rows of neat work sheds, where the workers who built the bridge were. Liu Xuebao raised his head, just about to call for help, when he suddenly noticed that about eighty meters ahead, in the window of the bridge arch support hole, there were blue sparks. Not good! The counter-revolutionary had placed a bomb on the bridge!

The fuse of the bomb on the bridge was sparking, and Liu Xuebao’s eyes were flashing with hatred for the class enemy. He had to rush up and defend the bridge, defend the fruits of the socialist revolution and socialist construction! He immediately took out the axe from his waist and swung it at the counter-revolutionary’s head. Due to the force, the axe flew off and landed far away. He then picked up a nearby stone and smashed it down on the enemy’s head. Liu Xuebao, representing the people of the country, gave this counter-revolutionary a severe punishment, smashing his dog’s head.

In this life-and-death struggle with the class enemy, the heroic soldier Liu Xuebao emerged victorious. However, a more severe test awaited him: the fuse of the bomb on the bridge was burning, and the bridge was in grave danger.

“Resolutely determined, not afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, strive for victory.” Chairman Mao’s teachings echoed in Liu Xuebao’s ears. He seemed to see Chairman Mao directing his battle, his blood boiling, his will unshakable: “As long as I am here, the bridge will be here! I would rather sacrifice myself than let the bridge be destroyed!”

Look! The heroic Liu Xuebao rushed forward! With astonishing courage, he rushed to the base of the bridge pier, reaching the support hole of the bridge arch!

Look! The heroic Liu Xuebao picked up the bomb, holding it under his left armpit, and quickly left the bridge, running down the slope!

Liu Xuebao ran while pulling out the fuse, but it wouldn’t come out; he tried to pinch it out, but it wouldn’t go out. “The further I run, the safer the bridge will be!” Liu Xuebao had only one thought, to get away from the bridge, further and further! To protect the bridge is to defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! Liu Xuebao ran while shouting, “Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!”

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Thinking of you, the revolutionary soldier’s heart is clear; thinking of you, the revolutionary soldier’s will is like steel; thinking of you, the revolutionary soldier has strength throughout his body, fearing no hardships, fearing no enemies on the revolutionary path.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! The sky is vast, but not as vast as your kindness; the sea is deep, but not as deep as your kindness. We revolutionary soldiers have made a vow: to live for you, to die for you.

Liu Xuebao, holding the bomb, was five meters, ten meters, twenty meters, thirty meters away from the bridge; the fuse on the bomb was four inches, three inches, two inches, one inch long, and he still tightly held the bomb and ran. At the moment the fuse burned out, at this critical moment, he threw the bomb away… A loud explosion echoed through the valley, and the fire lit up the earth.

Liu Xuebao was knocked down on the riverbank, losing his left hand, and was in a state of extreme unconsciousness. When the nearby workers and forest farm comrades rushed to rescue him, Liu Xuebao, who had just regained consciousness, told them, “Don’t worry about me, check if there are any more bombs on the bridge placed by the enemy.” Everyone told him the bridge was unharmed, and Liu Xuebao finally showed a victorious smile.

The majestic Qilian Mountains were cheering, the surging Dutong River was singing. Singing the hero who defended the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat! Singing the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

	Never Forget Class Struggle, Achieve New Victories on the Leftist Support Front

To respond to Chairman Mao’s great call for the People’s Liberation Army to support the broad masses of the left, in late July of last year, Liu Xuebao and two other comrades formed a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team and went to the forest farm to carry out leftist support tasks.

As soon as they entered the forest farm, they saw that the movement was cold and quiet, and the masses’ organizations were fighting “internal wars.” The evil winds of counter-revolutionary economism were blinding some of the masses. Liu Xuebao and the propaganda team comrades thought: There must be something fishy here, and we must get to the bottom of it.

One morning, Liu Xuebao had just gotten out of bed when he heard the sound of sweeping coming from afar. When it reached the propaganda team’s door, the broom hit the ground heavily, and the flying stones and bricks clattered against the door. Liu Xuebao looked and saw that the person sweeping was a historical counter-revolutionary who had been a deputy platoon leader of the Nationalist Party’s Lanzhou City Garrison before liberation. Liu Xuebao thought: This is not sweeping, but clearly trying to sweep us out the door! It was this guy who, upon seeing the propaganda team comrades, would first give three smiles and nod like a chicken pecking at grain, but when he turned his back, his teeth would grind. When he was assigned to work, he would sneakily sleep on the job; when he was told to pick potatoes, he would deliberately use a shovel to ruin the good ones… Why could such a guy stay in the forest farm for so long? Why could he be so arrogant during the Cultural Revolution?

Liu Xuebao and the propaganda team comrades conducted a thorough investigation among the masses. They clearly supported the revolutionary rebels who were then a minority in the forest farm and analyzed the revolutionary situation in the farm with them: The class struggle in this forest farm was sharp and complex, and the capitalist-roaders within the party and the ghosts and monsters were colluding with each other, and the lid had not been blown off. The capitalist-roaders within the party were recruiting and surrendering, and using their authority to play tricks of threats, inducements, promotions, and bribes, deceiving some of the masses; that counter-revolutionary was also hiding in the dark corners, working hard for his master, spreading evil winds and igniting evil fires everywhere, saying that in the forest farm, “those who have reason do not rebel, and those who rebel have no reason.” They muddied the waters, trying to strangle the Cultural Revolution in the forest farm.

Facing this situation, where should the work start? Looking up at the North Star, thinking of Chairman Mao. Liu Xuebao and the propaganda team comrades sat late into the night in front of Chairman Mao’s portrait, opening the red book and studying. “Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of revolution…. Our revolution must have the assurance of not going astray and of being certain to succeed. We cannot but pay attention to uniting our true friends to attack our true enemies.” Chairman Mao’s great teachings, like a lighthouse in the vast night mist, pointed them in the direction of uncovering the class struggle in the forest farm and achieving victory in the Cultural Revolution. Liu Xuebao and the propaganda team comrades excitedly said, “The golden key to unlocking the padlock has been found! This is to arm the broad masses of the forest farm with the great Mao Zedong Thought, to use Chairman Mao’s brilliant theories on class and class struggle to brighten the eyes of the masses, so that everyone can distinguish between friends and enemies, and direct the fire towards China’s Khrushchev and his agents in the forest farm, and towards the ghosts and monsters!”

To let the red sun shine in the hearts of every worker, Liu Xuebao and his comrades, with backpacks and the four volumes of Mao’s selected works, went into the deep mountains and forests to bring the treasures to the revolutionary masses. They braved the wind and rain, crossed mountains and valleys, and reached all the work points distributed in the sixty-million-mu forest. Everywhere they went, they first helped the revolutionary workers establish the daily reading system, organized revolutionary workers to hold lectures and meetings to recall bitterness and think of sweetness, taught them to sing Mao’s quotations, and helped them better understand the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. When Chairman Mao’s latest instructions from his inspection of North China, Central China, and East China were passed down, Liu Xuebao immediately rushed to all the points to convey them. The higher and denser the mountains and forests, the deeper the deception by the capitalist-roaders, the more he went. He and the worker comrades studied and discussed Chairman Mao’s latest instructions together and put them into practice.

Liu Xuebao deeply understood that the deceived masses were our class brothers, and it was our duty to bring them back to Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line and make them a revolutionary force. With deep proletarian feelings, he wholeheartedly did ideological and political work on the deceived masses. At first, due to the incitement and provocation of the capitalist-roaders and the ghosts and monsters, the deceived masses did not want to approach them. Liu Xuebao would go over, and people would avoid him. He would grab one to seek opinions, and people would say, “Educate yourself!” But Liu Xuebao did not give up, and worked even more patiently. A young worker was deeply deceived, and Liu Xuebao talked to him several times, but he always found excuses to avoid him. Once, he made Liu Xuebao wait for four hours at the appointed place. Later, at the instigation of the capitalist-roaders, this young worker simply went home to “enjoy himself.” Liu Xuebao thought, “This is a struggle with the class enemy to win over the masses and strengthen the revolutionary forces. Even if I encounter a hundred nails, I cannot turn back!” He traveled over a hundred miles to find this young worker’s home. He did patient ideological and political work on the young worker’s father, persuading him to use the bitterness of the old society to educate his son. That night, they held a family bitterness-thinking-of-sweetness meeting. When the old man recalled herding sheep for the landlord, going barefoot in winter, and filling his stomach with half grass roots and half fried flour, Liu Xuebao and the whole family shed bitter tears; when the worker’s mother talked about how all three of her sons had graduated from junior high school, and the happy days of socialism were getting better every day, the whole room was filled with hot tears. Liu Xuebao excitedly shouted, “But China’s Khrushchev and his agents want to drag us back to the old society, make us slaves again!” “We will never agree!” The whole room shouted in unison. That young worker, sobbing, vowed in front of Chairman Mao’s portrait, “I was deceived by the capitalist-roaders in the forest farm, and my selfishness made me stand on the wrong side. I will return to Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line and defend Chairman Mao to the death!” The next day, he returned to the forest farm despite his illness, making a big comeback. Through the persistent work of Liu Xuebao and his comrades, the deceived masses turned against the enemy and returned to Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line, and the proletarian revolutionary forces in the forest farm quickly grew stronger.

	“Class struggle, once grasped, is effective.” The flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the forest farm burned fiercely, sparking a new high tide of revolutionary criticism. Big-character posters flooded in, exposing the crimes of the capitalist-roaders in the forest farm against the party, against socialism, and against Mao Zedong Thought. It was the capitalist-roaders within the party who, after the counter-revolutionary was released from reform through labor, took him in and gave him a job; it was the capitalist-roaders within the party who, when the counter-revolutionary wrote black poems attacking the party and socialism, protected him in every way and even wrote reports to “rehabilitate” him several times; it was the capitalist-roaders within the party who took the counter-revolutionary as a key relief object and personally delivered the workers’ relief funds to his home…

The capitalist-roaders within the party were the protective umbrellas of the ghosts and monsters, and the ghosts and monsters were the black claws of the capitalist-roaders; they were in cahoots, relying on each other. Through exposure and struggle, the broad masses of the forest farm saw more clearly the ugly faces of the class enemies. They said, “These two bad guys are enemies of the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must drive out the main enemy—China’s Khrushchev and his agents—and at the same time, we must dig out all the hidden ghosts and monsters, so that we can ensure that our socialist homeland will not change color.”

Through this struggle, the capitalist-roaders and the counter-revolutionaries in the forest farm were exposed, and the broad revolutionary workers received great tempering, raising their awareness of the struggle between the two lines, quickly achieving revolutionary unity, and the situation was excellent.

The counter-revolutionary, seeing that his backer had collapsed and he himself had been exposed, made a desperate struggle, trying to sabotage the Cultural Revolution by blowing up the bridge. But in the face of the revolutionary soldier Liu Xuebao and the revolutionary masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought, he was beaten to a pulp, smashed to pieces!

	Mao Zedong Thought Tempered the Heart, Devoted to the Revolution

Water has a source, trees have roots. Liu Xuebao, who had been in the army for less than two years, fearlessly and selflessly in the stormy waves of class struggle, was entirely the result of being nurtured by the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

Liu Xuebao was born in a poor peasant family in the Ma’eri Commune of San Yuan County, Shaanxi Province. Before liberation, his family had been long-term hired laborers for the landlords for three generations, living a miserable life worse than cattle and horses. In 1949, Chairman Mao saved his entire family from the sea of suffering. As soon as he understood, his parents often told him, “Chairman Mao is our poor people’s closest and dearest relative, our greatest benefactor.” Liu Xuebao decided from a young age to follow Chairman Mao in revolution!

Chairman Mao’s books are Liu Xuebao’s favorite treasures. Chairman Mao’s brilliant theories on class and class struggle armed Liu Xuebao’s mind. He always remembered Chairman Mao’s teachings to use the perspective of class and class struggle and the method of class analysis to view and analyze everything.

In 1964, under the instigation of China’s Khrushchev, some rich peasants and idlers blew the wind of speculation and profiteering, digging at the foundations of socialist collective economy. Liu Xuebao, as the platoon leader of the militia, realized that this was a serious struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in the countryside. He decided to defend the socialist position in the countryside and fight mercilessly against the speculators and profiteers.

One day, a few speculators from Tongchuan drove a car to their production team to buy grain. When Liu Xuebao ran to the commune to report the situation and returned, the car had already slipped away. He and another young militia member jumped on their bicycles, following the tire tracks for more than ten miles, finally intercepting these bad guys in another village. A merchant-like guy, with a smile on his face, said to Liu Xuebao, “Little brother, please be lenient, we won’t treat you badly.” Liu Xuebao glared at him, saying, “You are destroying the socialist economy and still trying to bribe me, that’s out of the question!” Suddenly, he saw his cousin sneaking out of the car, which further ignited his anger. His cousin begged, “Xuebao, please give your cousin some face.” Liu Xuebao firmly said, “I am a militia member, Chairman Mao and the people have given me the gun, and I will defend socialism! You and I are not on the same path, there is no face to speak of!” This left his cousin speechless. Soon, the commune cadres, militia, and masses all rushed over, detaining these speculators and profiteers. The poor and lower-middle peasants all praised Liu Xuebao as a good militia member who dared to fight against bad people and bad deeds.

In March 1966, Liu Xuebao, with a heart full of loyalty to Chairman Mao, came to the People’s Liberation Army, this great school of Mao Zedong Thought. As soon as he arrived at the platoon, he happened to encounter the fierce movement of denouncing and criticizing the “Three Family Village.” Liu Xuebao immediately joined the battle, actively participating in writing critical articles. He wrote, “Deng Tuo and a handful of black gang members, under the guise of ‘spreading knowledge,’ tried to lure the youth onto the white expert road, ignoring class struggle. In fact, they are engaged in class struggle, but it is the bourgeoisie fighting against the proletariat. They are playing the magic of ‘changing the sky first changes the people, changing the people first changes the heart, changing the heart and the world is taken without fighting.’ We must always remember the great leader Chairman Mao’s teachings: ‘Never forget class struggle,’ and we must thoroughly expose and criticize these counter-revolutionaries’ evil plots to restore capitalism!” After the great leader Chairman Mao’s big-character poster “Bombard the Headquarters” was published, hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses launched a fierce attack on China’s Khrushchev. Liu Xuebao deeply understood that this was a great showdown between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, a great matter that decided the fate of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. He actively participated in the criticism and denunciation of China’s Khrushchev.

In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Liu Xuebao followed Chairman Mao’s great strategic deployment, always directing his spearhead at China’s Khrushchev and his agents, and always being vigilant against the class enemies’ sabotage and disruption. Last spring, Liu Xuebao’s platoon went to support agriculture in a commune near their station. Not long after entering the village, Liu Xuebao discovered that the team’s production was not going well. He closely relied on the poor and lower-middle peasants, using the perspective of class struggle to investigate and analyze, and found that a landlord was stirring up trouble. This landlord arrogantly shouted, “Now is a good time, it’s time to rise up.” On the one hand, he said to the cadres that “now the cadres are not in charge, working hard only brings trouble,” and on the other hand, he said bad things about the cadres to the masses, inciting the masses to fight the cadres. Liu Xuebao immediately organized the community members and cadres to study Chairman Mao’s statements on class and class struggle, helping everyone use the mirror of Mao Zedong Thought to see through the enemy’s tricks. “The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not willingly accept their defeat, they will still struggle desperately. After the country is pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways, trying to restore their power in China every day and every hour. This is inevitable, without a doubt, and we must not relax our vigilance.” Chairman Mao’s great teachings illuminated the eyes of the masses, and everyone stood up to expose the landlord’s evil deeds. Liu Xuebao organized the poor and lower-middle peasants to hold a struggle meeting, severely criticizing the landlord. The cadres and masses raised their awareness, united as one, grasped the revolution, and promoted production, creating a lively scene.

Liu Xuebao, relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, stood firmly on the proletarian position in the sharp and complex class struggle, bravely fought against the class enemies, and became a steadfast soldier defending Chairman Mao and the dictatorship of the proletariat. After Liu Xuebao was gloriously injured, his left hand was amputated. But he was not discouraged, his proletarian awareness was even higher, and his heart, loyal to Chairman Mao, was even redder. In his hospital diary, he wrote, “Losing one hand is nothing, there is still one hand, it can still fight against the class enemies, it can still shoot at the enemy, throw hand grenades! Defend Chairman Mao, defend Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line, defend the socialist homeland!”

	“With the Red Sun in My Heart, Everything for Chairman Mao.” It is this sublime and great ideal and unshakable belief that inspires the heroic Liu Xuebao to bravely advance on the revolutionary path!

    心中唯有红太阳，一切献给毛主席
    ——记保卫无产阶级文化大革命的英雄战士刘学保
      “数风流人物，还看今朝。”
    在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的凯歌声中，我们怀着激动的心情，向大家介绍保卫无产阶级文化大革命、保卫无产阶级专政的英雄战士刘学保的事迹。刘学保同志是八一一○部队某部三连副班长。他怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚，怀着对阶级敌人的刻骨仇恨，只身同反革命分子英勇搏斗，冒着炸药爆炸的危险抢救大桥，创造了惊天动地的业绩，谱写出又一曲毛泽东思想新时代的壮丽凯歌。
      勇往直前　有我无敌
    一九六七年十二月十七日，甘肃省永登县革命委员会光荣诞生了。永登地区革命形势一派大好。
    在永登县连城实验林场支左的刘学保同志，怀着无比兴奋的心情，送走了前往参加永登县革命委员会成立和庆祝大会的工人同志们。他觉得今天格外明亮，分外温暖。他的心飞向北京，飞向我们伟大的领袖毛主席。他在心底里欢呼：毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
      “人民大众开心之日，就是反革命分子难受之时”。“我们决不可因为胜利，而放松对于帝国主义分子及其走狗们的疯狂的报复阴谋的警惕性”。刘学保同志牢记毛主席的伟大教导，深深懂得阶级敌人决不会自动退出历史舞台，他们还要作临死前的挣扎；越是我们接近全面胜利的时候，越要提高革命警惕性，严防阶级敌人的阴谋破坏活动。他警惕地巡视在林场场部的院子里。
    傍晚，一个鬼影闪出大门。刘学保仔细一看，是林场的一个历史反革命分子。这个在解放前双手沾满人民鲜血的国民党兰州市宪兵副连长，极端仇视无产阶级专政，极端仇视无产阶级文化大革命。这家伙一出门，沿着公路，径直向大通河上游走去。刘学保望了望大通河上游屹立在落日余辉中的群山，那里是林场工人辛勤抚育出来的大片大片森林，那里有新建的桥梁，决不能让社会主义建设的成果受到任何损失，决不能让反革命分子的任何阴谋得逞！刘学保马上叫了林场的张士林同志，拿起短刀和斧子，跑步追了上去。
    初升的月亮被大通河畔的高山遮住，透过淡淡的月色，勉强可以分辨出大通河谷中弯曲的公路。那个反革命分子慌慌张张，一会窜过月色较强地段，一会猫着腰躲进阴暗处；一会转过头来窥探着身后，一会径直往前跑去。刘学保紧紧跟踪在反革命分子的身后，严密监视着他的一切行动。顺着公路，追了大约七公里时，月光更暗。反革命分子的步子突然加快，绕过一个山湾就不见了。向哪里跑了呢？顺公路不远，就是那座新建的大桥；再往前走，就是大森林。刘学保估计这个家伙不是去破坏大桥，就是钻进森林放火烧山，或者是搞反革命串连。敌人已经出笼，这正是歼灭的大好机会。刘学保悄悄地对张士林说：“你赶快回去叫人来，把敌人一网打尽！”张士林担心刘学保的安全，说：“前面是深山密林，你一个人跟去有危险。”刘学保坚定地回答：“你不要管我。革命不怕死，怕死不革命，保卫毛主席，死了也甘心。”并嘱咐张士林：“敌人要是钻山，我就放下鞋子，你们来时顺着我鞋尖方向往前追！”临别时，张士林将斧子递给刘学保：“老刘，你要多加警惕啊！”刘学保立刻用毛主席语录回答：“下定决心，不怕牺牲……”张士林接下去一齐念道：“排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    明知山有虎，偏向虎山行。刘学保怀着对毛主席的赤胆忠心，以大无畏的英雄气概，只身继续追踪反革命分子。前面就是大桥。两面笔陡的大山，把公路和大通河夹在中间，地势十分险要。突然，反革命分子迎面跑来！刘学保大吼一声：“站住！”话音未落，嗖——！一块石头紧擦刘学保的右耳飞过。刘学保一个箭步跨过去，想一把抓住反革命分子。这个受过专门训练的国民党特务，猫着腰向刘学保恶狼似地扑来，一下抱住刘学保的双腿，用头和肩将刘学保顶倒在地。刘学保想起毛主席的伟大教导：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。”顿时增添了无穷无尽的力量。他猛地翻过身来，用铁一般的右膝盖，以泰山压顶之力，向反革命分子的胸部压下去，一下压断了四根肋骨。
    大桥那边有一排排齐整的工棚，那里有修建大桥的工人兄弟。刘学保抬起头来，正要叫人的时候，突然发现前面八十米处的大桥桥拱支撑孔窗内，闪着蓝色的火花。不好！反革命分子在桥上放了炸药包！阶级敌人要毁掉这座国家新建的桥梁！
    桥上炸药包的导火索冒着火花，刘学保的眼睛里冒着对阶级敌人的仇恨的火花。要立刻冲上去保卫大桥，保卫社会主义革命和社会主义建设的成果！他马上掏出腰间的斧子，朝反革命分子头上砍去。由于用力过猛，斧头脱落，飞出去老远。他又顺手拣起身边的石头，向敌人的脑袋狠狠地砸了下去。刘学保代表祖国人民给这个反革命分子以严厉的制裁，砸烂了他的狗头。
    在这场同阶级敌人的生死搏斗中，英雄战士刘学保胜利了。但是，更严峻的考验摆在他的面前：桥上炸药包的导火索在燃烧，大桥处于严重危险之中。
      “下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”毛主席的教导不断在刘学保的耳边回响。他仿佛看见毛主席在指挥自己战斗，浑身热血沸腾，意志无比坚定：“有我在就有大桥在！宁可牺牲自己，也要保住大桥！”
    看！英雄的刘学保冲上去了！他以惊人的勇敢，冲上了桥墩下面的护坡，到达大桥桥拱的支撑孔了！
    看！英雄的刘学保抱起了炸药包，把它挟在左腋下，飞快地离开大桥，跑下了护坡！
    刘学保一边跑，一边拔导火索，拔不下；捻导火索，捻不灭。“多朝前跑几步，大桥就多一分安全！”刘学保只有一个念头，离大桥远一点！再远一点！保住大桥，就是保卫无产阶级文化大革命！刘学保一边跑，一边高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”
    毛主席啊，毛主席！想到您，革命战士心明眼亮；想到您，革命战士意志如钢；想到您，革命战士浑身上下有力量，艰难困苦无所惧，革命路上全无敌。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！天再大，没有您的恩情大，海再深，没有您的恩情深。我们革命战士立下誓言：生为您战斗，死为您献身。
    刘学保抱着炸药包，离开大桥五米，十米，二十米，三十米；炸药包上的导火索剩下四寸，三寸，两寸，一寸，他依然紧抱着炸药包飞跑。在导火索烧尽的一刹那间，在这千钧一发之际，他把炸药包甩出去……。“轰”的一声巨响，激荡着山谷的夜空，火光映红了大地。
      刘学保被震倒在河滩上，失去了左手，处在极度昏迷中。当附近的和林场的工人同志们赶来救护他的时候，刚刚苏醒了一些的刘学保对他们说：“不要管我，看桥上还有没有敌人放的炸药包。”大家告诉他大桥丝毫无损，刘学保这才露出了胜利的微笑。
    巍巍祁连山在欢呼，滔滔大通河在歌唱。歌唱保卫无产阶级文化大革命、保卫无产阶级专政的英雄！歌唱伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想！
    念念不忘阶级斗争　支左战线立新功
      为了响应毛主席“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”的伟大号召，去年七月下旬，刘学保和另外两个
  同志组成毛泽东思想宣传组，来到林场执行支左任务。
      他们一进林场，看到场里的运动搞得冷冷清清，群众组织之间在打“内战”，反革命经济主义的妖风蒙蔽着一部分群众的眼睛。刘学保和宣传组的同志们心想：这里面肯定有鬼，一定要搞个水落石出。
    一天清早，刘学保刚刚起床，就听到扫院子的声音由远而近。当扫到宣传组门前时，那扫帚落地又重又狠，扫起的瓦块。石子乒乒乓乓打在门上。刘学保一看，扫院子的是解放前当过国民党兰州市宪兵副连长的反革命分子。刘学保想：这哪里是扫院子，分明是想把我们扫出门去呀！就是这个家伙，见了宣传组的同志先带三声笑，点头如同鸡啄米，可是背过脸去，牙齿咬得咯咯响。派他劳动，他偷偷睡大觉；叫他拣洋芋，他故意用铁锹把好的铲烂……象这样的家伙，为什么能长期在林场呆着？为什么在文化大革命中还敢如此嚣张？
    刘学保和宣传组的同志到群众中作了深入细致的调查。他们旗帜鲜明地支持了林场里当时只占少数的革命造反派，并和他们共同分析了场里的革命形势：这个林场的阶级斗争尖锐复杂，党内走资派和牛鬼蛇神互相勾结，盖子还没有揭开。党内走资派招降纳叛，并且利用职权，玩弄威胁利诱、封官许愿等花招，蒙蔽了一部分群众；那个反革命分子也躲在阴暗的角落里，为他的主子大卖力气，到处煽阴风，点邪火，说什么在林场里是“有理的不造反，造反的没有理”。他们把水搅浑，妄图扼杀林场的文化大革命。
    面对这种情况，工作该从哪里下手呢？抬头望见北斗星，心里想念毛主席。刘学保和宣传组的同志深夜围坐在毛主席像前，打开红彤彤的宝书学起来。“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。……我们的革命要有不领错路和一定成功的把握，不可不注意团结我们的真正的朋友，以攻击我们的真正的敌人。”毛主席的伟大教导，象茫茫夜雾中的灯塔，给他们指明了揭开林场阶级斗争盖子、取得文化大革命胜利的方向。刘学保和宣传组的同志兴奋地说：“打开闷锁的金钥匙找到了！这就是用伟大的毛泽东思想武装林场广大群众，用毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的光辉理论去擦亮群众的眼睛，使大家分清敌我，把火烧向中国赫鲁晓夫和他在林场的代理人，烧向牛鬼蛇神！”
    为了让红太阳照亮每个职工的心，刘学保等同志背着背包，带着雄文四卷，到深山密林中去给革命群众送宝。他们顶风冒雨，翻山越岭，把分布在六十多万亩山林里的十几个作业点都跑到了。每到一地，他们首先帮助革命职工建立起天天读的制度，组织革命职工开讲用会和忆苦思甜大会，教唱毛主席语录歌，帮助大家更好地理解无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义。当毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区时发出的一系列最新指示传下来的时候，刘学保就立即赶赴各个点去传达。越是山高林密的地方，越是受走资派蒙蔽最深的地方，他越是去。他和工人同志一起学习、讨论伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，并且身体力行，带头落实毛主席的最新指示。
    刘学保深深懂得，受蒙蔽的群众是我们的阶级兄弟，争取他们回到毛主席的革命路线上来，成为革命的力量，是我们义不容辞的责任。他怀着深厚的无产阶级感情，满腔热忱地对受蒙蔽的群众做思想政治工作。起初，由于受走资派和牛鬼蛇神的煽动、挑拨，受蒙蔽的群众不愿接近他们。刘学保一走过去，人家就躲开，拉住一个征求意见，人家说：“自己教育自己吧！”但刘学保并不因此灰心，更加耐心地进行工作。有个青年工人受蒙蔽较深，刘学保几次找他谈话，他都借故躲开。有一次，他让刘学保在约好的地点白等了四个小时。后来，在走资派的怂恿下，这个青年工人干脆回家“逍遥”去了。刘学保心想：“这是一场与阶级敌人争取群众、壮大革命力量的斗争，就是碰一百个钉子我也不能回头！”他赶了一百多里路，找到这个青年工人家里去。他对这个青年工人的父亲做了耐心的思想政治工作，说服他用旧社会的阶级苦来教育自己的儿子。当晚，他们就开了家庭忆苦思甜会。当老汉忆到给地主放羊，冬天光着脚，用一半草根一半炒面充饥时，刘学保和他们全家都流下了辛酸的眼泪；当这个工人的母亲谈起现在三个儿子都是初中毕业，社会主义的幸福日子天天向上时，全屋的人又是热泪盈眶。刘学保激动地大声说：“可是中国赫鲁晓夫和他的代理人却要把我们拉回到旧社会去，叫我们重新做牛做马！”“我们决不答应！”全屋人异口同声地喊起来。那个青年工人泣不成声地在毛主席像前表决心：“我受了林场走资派的蒙骗，私心使我站错了队。我要回到毛主席的革命路线上来，誓死保卫毛主席！”第二天，他就带病赶回林场，大“杀”回马枪。经过刘学保等同志坚持不懈的工作，受蒙蔽的群众纷纷反戈一击，回到毛主席的革命路线上来，林场的无产阶级革命队伍迅速壮大起来。
      “阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”林场的无产阶级文化大革命的烈火熊熊地燃烧起来了，掀起了革命大批判的新高潮。大字报铺天盖地而来，揭出了林场走资派大量反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的罪行。就是党内走资派，把这个反革命分子在劳改释放后收留在林场，并加以重用；就是党内走资派，当这个反革命分子写黑诗攻击党和社会主义时，百般庇护，还几次写报告要为他“平反”；就是党内走资派，把这个反革命分子作为重点救济对象，把职工救济费亲自送到他的家里……
    党内走资派是牛鬼蛇神的保护伞，牛鬼蛇神是走资派的黑爪牙；它们狼狈为奸，相依为命。通过揭发、斗争，林场广大群众越来越看清楚了阶级敌人的丑恶面目。他们说：“这两个坏家伙都是无产阶级专政的敌人。我们必须把最主要的敌人——中国赫鲁晓夫和他的代理人清除出去，同时也要把一切隐藏的牛鬼蛇神挖出来，这样才能保证我们的社会主义江山不变颜色。”
    通过这场斗争，林场的走资派和反革命分子被揪出来了，广大革命职工受到了极大的锻炼，提高了对两条路线斗争的觉悟，迅速实现了革命的大联合，形势一片大好。
    反革命分子见他赖以生存的后台倒坍了，自己也原形毕露了，就狗急跳墙，进行垂死挣扎，妄图用炸桥来破坏文化大革命。可是，在用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命战士刘学保和革命群众面前，他被碰得头破血流，粉身碎骨！
    毛泽东思想炼红心　一心一意为革命
    水有源，树有根。入伍不到两年的刘学保，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中无私无畏，完全是战无不胜的毛泽东思想哺育的结果。
    刘学保出生在陕西省三原县马额公社一个贫农家里。解放前，他家三代都给地主扛长工，过着牛马不如的悲惨生活。一九四九年，毛主席把他全家从苦海里救了出来。他一懂事，父母亲就经常对他说：“毛主席是咱们穷人最亲最亲的亲人，最大最大的恩人。”刘学保从小就下定决心，永远跟着毛主席干革命！
    毛主席的书，是刘学保最爱读的宝书。毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的光辉理论，武装了刘学保的头脑。他时刻牢记毛主席的教导，要用阶级和阶级斗争的观点，用阶级分析的方法去看待一切，分析一切。
    一九六四年，在中国赫鲁晓夫的怂恿下，一些地富分子和不务正业的人，大刮投机倒把的歪风，大挖社会主义集体经济的墙脚。担任民兵排长的刘学保意识到这是农村两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的严重斗争。他决心保卫农村的社会主义阵地，向投机倒把分子作无情的斗争。
    一天，铜川的几个投机倒把分子，开着汽车到他们生产队套购粮食。当刘学保跑到公社报告情况回来，汽车已经溜跑了。他和另一个青年民兵，飞身骑上自行车，顺着车辙追了十几里，终于在另一个村子，截住了这几个坏家伙。一个商人模样的家伙，陪着笑脸对刘学保说：“小兄弟，请包涵一点吧，我们不会亏待你的。”刘学保瞪圆双眼说：“你们破坏社会主义经济，还想收买我，万万办不到！”突然，他发现他的表哥躲躲闪闪从汽车里钻出来，更激起他满腔怒火。他表哥哀求说：“学保，你给表哥留点情面吧。”刘学保坚定地说：“我是个民兵，毛主席和人民把枪杆子交给我，我就要保卫社会主义！你和我们走的不是一条道路，没有什么情面好讲！”驳得他表哥哑口无言。不一会，公社的干部、民兵和群众都赶来了，扣住了这些投机倒把分子。贫下中农都称赞刘学保是保卫社会主义的好民兵，敢于和坏人坏事作斗争的闯将。
    一九六六年三月，刘学保怀着保卫毛主席的赤胆忠心，来到人民解放军这座毛泽东思想大学校里。他一到连队，正赶上轰轰烈烈地开展声讨、批判“三家村”的群众运动，刘学保立即投入战斗，积极参加写批判文章。他写道：“邓拓等一小撮黑帮分子，以‘传知识’为名，极力引诱青年走白专道路，不问阶级斗争。其实他们搞的就是阶级斗争，只不过是资产阶级向无产阶级作斗争。他们耍的是‘要变天先变人，要变人先变心，人心变了天下不夺而取’的魔术。我们一定要牢记伟大领袖毛主席的教导：‘千万不要忘记阶级斗争’，一定要把这些反革命分子复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋彻底揭穿，彻底批臭！”伟大领袖毛主席《炮打司令部》的大字报发表后，亿万革命群众向中国赫鲁晓夫发起了猛烈的进攻。刘学保深刻认识到这是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大决战，是决定中国革命和世界革命命运的大事。他积极地参加对中国赫鲁晓夫的批判和声讨。
    在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，刘学保紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，始终把矛头指向中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人，时刻警惕阶级敌人进行破坏和捣乱。去年春天，刘学保所在的连队到驻地附近一个公社去支农。进村不久，刘学保就发现队里的生产搞得不好。他紧紧依靠贫下中农，用阶级斗争的观点去调查、分析，发现一个地主分子在兴风作浪。这个地主分子狂妄叫嚣：“现在是好年道，是翻身的时候了。”一面在干部面前胡说什么“现在的干部没当头，白落一身辛苦还要得罪人”，一面又在群众面前说干部的坏话，挑动群众去乱斗干部。刘学保立即组织社员和干部学习毛主席有关阶级和阶级斗争的论述，帮助大家用毛泽东思想的照妖镜识破敌人的阴谋诡计。“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”毛主席的伟大教导，擦亮了群众的眼睛，大家纷纷起来揭发地主分子的罪恶活动。刘学保组织贫下中农开了斗争大会，狠斗了地主分子。干部和群众提高了觉悟，团结一致，狠抓革命，猛促生产，出现了热气腾腾的景象。
    刘学保就是靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，坚定地站稳无产阶级立场，勇敢地同阶级敌人作斗争，成为一名保卫毛主席、保卫无产阶级专政的坚强战士。刘学保光荣负伤后，左手截肢了。但他身残志不残，无产阶级觉悟提得更高，一颗忠于毛主席的心炼得更红。他在住院的日记中写道：“失去一只手算什么，还有一只手，照样可以同阶级敌人作斗争，照样可以向敌人开枪，投手榴弹！保卫毛主席，保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，保卫社会主义江山！”
      “心中唯有红太阳，一切献给毛主席。”正是这种崇高的伟大理想和坚定不移的信念，鼓舞着英雄刘学保在革命的大道上永远奋勇前进！《解放军报》通讯员、《解放军报》记者
