The broad masses of American blacks have risen up in rebellion! Their struggle against violence has swept across more than a hundred cities in the United States like a sudden storm, leaving the Johnson administration in a state of panic and confusion.

American black brothers, you have done well! Against the savage American imperialism and the evil colonialism, you must resist and fight back! We enthusiastically applaud the publication of the statement by the red sun in the hearts of the people of the world, Chairman Mao, supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence. We Red Guards resolutely respond to the call of our great teacher Chairman Mao and strongly support the just struggle of American blacks!

In his statement, our great teacher Chairman Mao pointed out: "This storm of the black people's struggle has occurred within the United States, and is a prominent manifestation of the current political and economic crises of American imperialism. It has dealt a heavy blow to the American imperialists who are beset by internal and external difficulties."

The current political and economic crises in the United States are extremely serious and profound. American imperialism has been beaten to a pulp and suffered a humiliating defeat in the Vietnam War, fully exposing the true nature of this paper tiger. The criminal Vietnam War has met with strong opposition from the people of the world, including the American people. The failure of the Vietnam War has further split imperialism and intensified internal strife within the American ruling class, leading to endless arguments. The enormous expenditure of the Vietnam War has caused serious political and economic crises in the United States, with the dollar's position on the brink of collapse. American imperialism has already fallen into a situation of internal and external difficulties, with no way out.

To cope with the enormous expenditure of the Vietnam War, the Johnson administration has frantically increased various taxes, coupled with inflation and rising prices, the American working people, especially the black masses who are already at the bottom of society, are suffering even greater disasters. American blacks face the most difficulties in employment, have the highest unemployment rates, the lowest wages, and the hardest lives. The American ruling class has intensified its oppression of the working people, making the class contradictions within the United States increasingly acute. The current unprecedented scale of the American blacks' struggle against violence is not isolated or accidental; it is a prominent manifestation of the current political and economic crises of American imperialism.

The struggle of American blacks against violence is fierce and vast in scale. It has dealt a heavy blow to the aggressive and war policies of American imperialism, shaking the reactionary rule of American imperialism at home. No matter how savage the suppression by the American reactionary ruling class, no matter what deceptive tactics they use, they will not be able to extinguish the flames of the struggle for liberation by American blacks. Imperialism will surely be defeated! The struggle of American blacks against violence will surely triumph!

    美国黑人抗暴斗争必胜！
    国际关系学院　红五洲
    美国广大的黑人群众起来造反了！他们的抗暴斗争，如疾风骤雨，横扫美国一百多个城市，打得约翰逊政府手忙脚乱，疲于奔命。
    美国黑人弟兄们，你们干得好！对穷凶极恶的美帝国主义和万恶的殖民主义，就是要反抗、要斗争！我们热烈欢呼世界人民心中最红的红太阳毛主席《支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明》的发表，我们红卫兵坚决响应伟大导师毛主席的号召，大力支持美国黑人的正义斗争！
    伟大导师毛主席在声明中指出：“这场黑人的斗争风暴发生在美国国内，是美帝国主义当前整个政治危机和经济危机的一个突出表现。它给陷于内外交困的美帝国主义以沉重的打击。”
    美国当前的政治危机和经济危机是十分严重的、深刻的。美帝国主义在侵越战争中被打得焦头烂额、一败涂地，充分暴露了这只纸老虎的原形。罪恶的侵越战争遭到了包括美国人民在内的世界人民的强烈反对。侵越战争的失败使得帝国主义更加四分五裂，使得美国统治集团内讧日益加剧、争吵不休。侵越战争的巨大耗费引起了美国严重的政治经济危机，美元地位摇摇欲坠。美帝国主义已经陷入内外交困、走投无路的境地。
    为了应付侵越战争的巨大开支，约翰逊政府拚命增加各种苛捐杂税，加上通货膨胀、物价不断上涨，美国劳动人民，特别是本来就处于社会最底层的黑人群众遭受更深重的灾难。美国黑人就业最难，失业最多，工资最低，生活最苦。美国统治集团加剧对劳动人民的压迫，使得美国国内阶级矛盾日益激烈。当前这场空前规模的美国黑人抗暴斗争不是孤立的、偶然的，它正是美帝国主义当前整个政治危机和经济危机的一个突出表现。
    美国黑人的抗暴斗争来势迅猛，规模壮阔。它沉重地打击了美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，动摇了美帝国主义在国内的反动统治。美国反动统治集团不管进行怎样野蛮的镇压，不管玩弄什么欺骗的手法，都不可能扑灭美国黑人争取解放的斗争烈火。美帝必败！美国黑人的抗暴斗争必胜！
