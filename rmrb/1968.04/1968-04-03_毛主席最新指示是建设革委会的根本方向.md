Chairman Mao's latest directive summarizes the experiences of revolutionary committees at all levels and points out the fundamental direction for building revolutionary committees. We will carry out this directive to the letter and execute it ten thousand times over!

The revolutionary committees formed by the "three-in-one combination" are a great innovation by the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses in their struggle to seize power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. They are a new thing that has emerged in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They need to be continually developed, perfected, and consolidated. They need a process of construction. By building revolutionary committees in accordance with Chairman Mao's latest directive, we can better adapt to the socialist economic base, further consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and prevent capitalist restoration. By building revolutionary committees in accordance with Chairman Mao's latest directive, we can better implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, better grasp and execute the Party's policies, and correctly organize and lead the masses forward. By building revolutionary committees in accordance with Chairman Mao's latest directive, we can carry forward the spirit of hard work and plain living, frugality, and oppose the infiltration of bourgeois ideology. This will make the revolutionary committees into battle command posts that are politically in command, full of revolutionary spirit, decisive, and powerful.

In places where revolutionary committees have not yet been established, we must resolutely follow Chairman Mao's latest directive to quickly set up revolutionary committees and quickly "organize a revolutionary, mass-linked leading cadre." Such revolutionary committees will be able to lead the broad revolutionary masses to fight hard battles and win victories. They will be "revolutionary, representative, and authoritative temporary organs of proletarian power."

In places where revolutionary committees have already been established, we must use Chairman Mao's latest directive as our weapon and follow it as our fundamental direction to build, develop, perfect, and consolidate them. We must build on our achievements, correct our shortcomings and mistakes, and continue to advance along the direction pointed out by Chairman Mao.

    毛主席最新指示是建设革委会的根本方向
    毛主席的最新指示，总结了各级革命委员会的经验，为革命委员会的建设指出了根本的方向。我们一千个照办，一万个执行！
      “三结合”的革命委员会，是我国亿万革命群众向党内一小撮走资派进行夺权斗争过程中的一个伟大创举，是无产阶级文化大革命群众运动中涌现出来的新生事物。它还需要不断地发展、完善和巩固。它还需要有一个建设的过程。按照毛主席的最新指示建设革命委员会，就能更加适应社会主义经济基础，更加巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟。按照毛主席的最新指示建设革命委员会，就能更好地贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，更好地掌握和执行党的方针政策，正确地组织和带领群众前进。按照毛主席的最新指示建设革命委员会，就能发扬艰苦朴素、勤俭节约的精神，抵制资产阶级思想的侵袭，就能使革命委员会成为突出无产阶级政治，充满革命干劲，雷厉风行，精悍有力的战斗指挥部。
    一切还没有建立革命委员会的地方，要坚决按照毛主席的最新指示迅速把革命委员会建立起来，并迅速“组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”。这样的革命委员会，就能带领广大革命群众打硬仗，打胜仗，就会是“革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构”。
    一切已经建立起来的革命委员会，都要用毛主席的最新指示为武器，都要以毛主席的最新指示为根本方向，去建设它，发展它，完善它，巩固它。要发扬成绩，改正缺点错误，沿着毛主席指出的方向继续前进。　武汉《长江日报》
