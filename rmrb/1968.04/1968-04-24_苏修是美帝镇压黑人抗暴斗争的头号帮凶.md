The Soviet revisionists are the chief accomplices of U.S. imperialism in suppressing the black people's struggle for liberation.

	According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on April 22, our correspondent reports: At a time when U.S. imperialism is being scorched by the flames of the black people's struggle for liberation and is in deep trouble, the chief accomplices of U.S. imperialism in suppressing the revolutionary movements of the peoples of the world, the Soviet revisionist leaders, have once again served the U.S. ruling class. They actively cooperate with the Johnson administration's counter-revolutionary two-pronged strategy against the blacks, viciously slander the current black people's struggle for liberation in the United States, and shamelessly exonerate U.S. imperialism's bloody suppression of the blacks. They brazenly advocate non-violence and preach "class harmony" and "peaceful reform," attempting to help U.S. imperialism extinguish the surging struggle for liberation by the black people in the United States. This is another blatant exposure of the traitorous face of the Soviet revisionists.

	The great teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, teaches us: "The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle." The assassination of the American black pastor and non-violence advocate Martin Luther King by U.S. imperialists has once again deeply taught the broad masses of black people in the United States: American blacks cannot achieve thorough liberation through non-violence but must take the path of violent revolution indicated by Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and respond to the counter-revolutionary violence of the U.S. ruling class with revolutionary violence. The new storm of the black people's struggle for liberation that has shaken the world reflects their further political awakening. All revolutionary peoples of the world cheer for this. However, the Soviet revisionist clique hates the revolutionary awakening and revolutionary violence of American blacks to death and hurriedly jumps out, coordinating with the U.S. imperialists' counter-revolutionary two-pronged strategy, attempting to lead the black people's struggle in the United States astray onto the path of non-violence.

	To peddle the bankrupt non-violence, the Soviet revisionist clique, after the black people's struggle for liberation began, mobilized all their propaganda machines to distort and slander the heroic struggle for liberation of American blacks. At the same time, they whitewashed the Johnson administration's bloody suppression of the black people's struggle. In their extensive reports and comments on this black people's struggle, the Soviet revisionist clique shamelessly and maliciously exaggerated the so-called "losses" and "damage" to American property in this struggle, slandering this just struggle as "racial riots." On April 6, Pravda openly stood on the side of the American monopolistic bourgeoisie, using the words of the U.S. imperialist chief Johnson to describe this just struggle as "blindly taking violent actions" and disrupting "peace." On April 10, TASS, in its report, talked at length about the "losses" brought to American cities by this black people's struggle and even viciously quoted the comments of The New York Times, cursing the black people's struggle for liberation, saying that "the foundations of order, reason, and trust that support civilized society are collapsing," and shouting that this is "the most terrible consequence." The Soviet revisionist clique gnashed their teeth at the revolutionary violence of the American black people, but for the criminal acts of the U.S. government in mobilizing large numbers of police to suppress the black people's struggle, they shamelessly beautified them, saying that this was to "restore order in the cities" and "clear the streets of crowds," and so on.

	The Soviet revisionist traitors and labor bureaucrats not only distorted and slandered the current black people's struggle for liberation in the United States, but their newspapers and news agencies also published many comments and articles during this period, openly urging American blacks to place their struggle for freedom and liberation under the banner of non-violent "struggle." They advocated that through the "non-violent" path, one could "end the powerlessness of (American) blacks, eliminate poverty," and even said that "anti-war non-violent actions" and appeals to the "conscience" of the American monopolistic bourgeoisie "can make the country progress," and so on.

	In addition, in these comments and articles, the Soviet revisionist clique also took the opportunity to peddle Khrushchev's wares of a "world without war" and that with "peace," everything would be fine to the increasingly awakened American black people. They propagated that as long as imperialism and the capitalist system continued to exist, American blacks could get rid of their long-term poverty as long as there was no war in the world. What was even more absurd was that on April 11, Labor Newspaper and on April 7, TASS further deceived American blacks, saying that as long as the "Vietnam War" was ended, the American monopolistic bourgeoisie sitting on the heads of American blacks and their chief executive, the Johnson government, could turn the "enormous wealth of the country" to the oppressed, and the "three hundred billion dollars spent on the bloody war in Vietnam" could be used to "improve the lives of urban residents."

	In a word, the Soviet revisionist leadership is trying every means to make American blacks disarm in the face of U.S. imperialist counter-revolutionary violence and submit to the reactionary rule of the American monopolistic bourgeoisie, with extremely malicious intentions.

	Beautifying the U.S. ruling class, peddling the wares of "class harmony" and "peaceful reform"

	Chairman Mao said: "The racial discrimination in the United States is a product of colonialism and imperialism. The contradiction between the broad masses of blacks in the United States and the U.S. ruling class is a class contradiction. Only by overthrowing the reactionary rule of the American monopolistic bourgeoisie and destroying the colonialist and imperialist system can American blacks achieve thorough liberation."

	The Soviet revisionist leadership, in order to cover up the class contradiction between the broad masses of blacks in the United States and the U.S. ruling class, is vigorously peddling the wares of "class harmony" and "peaceful reform." They actively praise and propagate various deceptive measures of the U.S. ruling class against the blacks, helping the Johnson government maintain the colonialist and imperialist system of U.S. imperialism.

	After Martin Luther King was assassinated by U.S. imperialists, the Soviet revisionist newspapers frantically collected and spread the deceptive ghost stories of the U.S. government around this incident, helping U.S. imperialist rulers to shirk responsibility. They followed the tune of the U.S. government, fully propagating how Johnson, Humphrey, and others felt "sad" and "ashamed" about Martin Luther King's assassination. On April 11, the Soviet revisionist newspapers even, under the headline "Progressive America in Mourning," propagated the deceptive tricks of the U.S. ruling class, such as Johnson attending a church prayer for Martin Luther King, U.S. Vice President Humphrey attending the funeral, and the White House lowering the flag to half-mast to "mourn," as the "sympathy" and "support" of the U.S. ruling class for blacks.

	When talking about changing the poverty and powerlessness of American blacks, the Soviet revisionist newspapers vigorously peddled the revisionist wares of solving the black people's problem "peacefully" through "parliamentary democracy," advocating that as long as the "U.S. government and Congress take measures," the situation of blacks can be "improved," and so on. After the U.S. Senate passed a piece of paper to deceive and coax blacks, known as the "Civil Rights" bill, on April 10, the Soviet revisionists, as if they had found a treasure, immediately cheered for U.S. imperialism, propagating that this bill "prohibits racial discrimination in the sale and rental of housing" and is a "concession" by the U.S. ruling class. During this period, they also specially brought out an old report from the U.S. President's tool, the "Special Advisory Committee on Civil Disorders." This report suggested that the U.S. authorities take some "reforms" to ease the black people's struggle, and its deceptive nature is very obvious. However, an article in Labor Newspaper on April 7 said that this report was "sober-minded" and that the suggestions in the report were a "serious social reform plan"; a TASS report on April 17 also expressed that these "suggestions" would help to "eliminate" the "causes of racial disputes and conflicts in the United States."

	Consistently opposing the black people's struggle, an enemy of the American blacks

	The traitorous actions of the Soviet revisionist leadership against the black people's struggle for liberation in the United States are not accidental but are a continuation of their crimes of acting as faithful accomplices of the American monopolistic bourgeoisie and attempting to extinguish the flames of the black people's revolutionary struggle over the years.

	In the summer of 1964, when the broad masses of black people in the United States, led by the blacks in New York City's Harlem, launched a large-scale armed struggle for liberation, the Khrushchev clique had blatantly stood on the side of the U.S. ruling class, opposing that black people's struggle. They, through TASS, put on the air of a protector of the colonialist system, cursing the black people who participated in that heroic struggle as "rioters," slandering this struggle as "outbreaks of savagery and violence," and attacking those black organizations that advocated revolutionary violence to counter counter-revolutionary violence as so-called "extremist organizations." On the other hand, they flattered the U.S. reactionary authorities to the extreme, praising the fascist methods of U.S. imperialism in suppressing blacks, saying that this was for the so-called "restoration of order and law in the city" and so on.

	The Brezhnev and Kosygin clique completely inherited the counter-revolutionary legacy of Khrushchev, committing many new crimes against the struggle of American blacks. For example, in January 1965, the blacks in Selma, Alabama, launched a large-scale struggle for voting rights, which was enthusiastically supported and responded to by black people in more than twenty cities. During this period, the Brezhnev and Kosygin clique eagerly sang praises for the so-called "civil rights bill" proposed by the Johnson government to paralyze the fighting spirit of blacks, helping the U.S. ruling class to deceive blacks politically. They advocated that the Johnson government's proposal of this purely empty "bill" was "necessary," and it "prohibits any restrictions and procedures aimed at depriving people of their voting rights or reducing such rights on the basis of race and skin color." TASS at that time also propagated that "Johnson urged Congressmen and Senators to work day and night, without holidays, to pass the bill on guaranteeing the voting rights of blacks," frantically whitewashing this chief executioner of the suppression of the black people's struggle in the United States.

	On the issue of the struggle for liberation of American blacks, anti-imperialism must also be anti-revisionism

	In his exposure of the great traitor of the Second International, Kautsky, Lenin once quoted Feuerbach's words, pointing out incisively: "Whoever comforts the slaves without inciting them to rise up against slavery is an accomplice of the slave owners." The U.S. ruling class has long been using not only violent suppression but also political deception against the struggle of American blacks, attempting to lead the struggle for liberation and freedom of American blacks onto the track of non-violence, using the so-called "peaceful reform" illusion to destroy the struggle for liberation and freedom of American blacks. The actions of the Soviet revisionist leadership over the years on the issue of American blacks fully prove that they have unconditionally acted as the chief accomplices of U.S. imperialism in extinguishing the flames of the struggle of American blacks. To oppose imperialism, one must also oppose revisionism. American blacks must achieve thorough liberation, overthrow the reactionary rule of the American monopolistic bourgeoisie, and must continue to see through the counter-revolutionary face of the Soviet revisionists and resolutely oppose modern revisionism together with all revolutionary peoples of the world.

    苏修是美帝镇压黑人抗暴斗争的头号帮凶
    据新华社二十二日讯  本社记者报道：正当美帝国主义被美国黑人抗暴斗争烈火烧得焦头烂额、深陷困境的时候，美帝镇压世界人民革命运动的头号帮凶苏修领导集团，再次为美国统治集团效劳，积极配合约翰逊政府对黑人的反革命两手策略，大肆诋毁这次美国黑人抗暴斗争，极力为美帝对黑人的血腥镇压开脱罪责，无耻宣扬非暴力主义，鼓吹“阶级调和”和“和平改革”，妄图帮助美帝把风起云涌的美国黑人抗暴斗争扑灭下去。这是苏修叛徒嘴脸的又一次大暴露。
    恶毒咒骂美国黑人抗暴斗争，大肆宣扬非暴力主义无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席教导我们说：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权”。美国黑人牧师、非暴力主义者马丁·路德·金遭到美帝国主义者的暗杀，再一次深刻地教训了美国广大的黑人群众：美国黑人决不能靠非暴力获得彻底解放，而必须走马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想所指出的暴力革命的道路，用革命暴力回答美国统治集团的反革命暴力。美国黑人群众这次震撼世界的抗暴斗争新风暴，正反映了他们政治上的进一步觉醒。全世界一切革命人民对此无不同声欢呼。然而，苏修集团对美国黑人的这种革命觉醒和他们的革命暴力恨得要死，急急忙忙跳出来，同美帝的反革命两手遥相配合，企图把美国黑人斗争引向非暴力主义的歧途。
    为了推销破了产的非暴力主义，继续用这个罗网束缚美国黑人斗争，在美国黑人这次抗暴斗争开始以后，苏修集团开动它们的一切宣传机器，千方百计歪曲和诬蔑美国黑人这次英勇的抗暴斗争，同时为约翰逊政府对黑人斗争的血腥镇压进行粉饰。苏修集团在关于这次黑人斗争的大量报道和评论中，竟丧心病狂地、别有用心地大肆渲染这次斗争对美国财产的所谓
  “损失”和“破坏”。把这次正义斗争污蔑为“种族骚乱”。《消息报》四月六日公然站在美国垄断资产阶级的立场上，借美帝头子约翰逊之口，把这场正义斗争说成是“盲目采取暴力”，破坏了“平静”。塔斯社四月十日在报道中，大谈美国黑人这次斗争“给美国城市带来的损失”，甚至卑鄙地引用《纽约时报》的评论，恶狠狠咒骂黑人抗暴斗争使“支持着文明社会的秩序、理智和信任的一切基础正在崩溃”，叫嚷什么这是“最可怕的后果”。苏修集团对美国黑人群众的革命暴力如此咬牙切齿，而对美国政府调动大批军警血腥镇压黑人斗争的罪恶行为，却无耻加以美化，丧心病狂地说什么这是在城市里“建立秩序”，“清除街道人群”等等。
    苏修叛徒、工贼们不仅歪曲、诬蔑美国黑人这次抗暴斗争，他们的报刊、通讯社在这一时期还发表了不少评论和文章，公开要美国黑人把争取自由和解放的斗争，放在非暴力“斗争的旗帜”之下。它们鼓吹通过“非暴力”道路，就可以“结束（美国）黑人的无权状态，消除贫困”，还胡说什么“反战非暴力行动”以及对美国垄断资产阶级“良心的呼吁”“能够使国家进步”，如此等等。
    此外，苏修集团在这些评论和文章中，还乘机向日益觉醒的美国黑人群众贩卖赫鲁晓夫“没有战争的世界”、有了“和平”似乎就有了一切的黑货，宣传尽管帝国主义和资本主义制度继续存在，只要世界上没有战争，美国黑人就可以摆脱他们长期来所处的贫穷状态。尤其荒唐的是，《劳动报》四月十一日、塔斯社四月七日还进一步欺骗美国黑人，说什么只要“结束了越南战争”，骑在美国黑人头上的美国垄断资产阶级以及它们的大总管约翰逊政府，就可以把美国“国家的巨大财富转而用在被压迫者身上”，“每年花费在越南血腥战争的三百亿美元”，就可以用来“改善美国城市居民的生活”。
    总之一句话，苏修领导集团千方百计地妄图要美国黑人在美帝反革命暴力面前解除武装，屈从于美国垄断资产阶级的反动统治，其用心恶毒透顶。
      美化美国统治集团，贩卖“阶级调和”、“和平改革”黑货
    毛主席说：“美国的种族歧视，是殖民主义、帝国主义制度的产物。美国广大黑人同美国统治集团之间的矛盾，是阶级矛盾。只有推翻美国垄断资产阶级的反动统治，摧毁殖民主义、帝国主义制度，美国黑人才能够取得彻底解放。”
    苏修领导集团为了掩饰美国广大黑人同美国统治集团之间的阶级矛盾，竭力贩卖“阶级调和”、“和平改革”的黑货，积极吹捧和宣扬美国统治集团对黑人的各种欺骗性措施，帮助约翰逊政府维护美帝的殖民主义、帝国主义制度。
    在马丁·路德·金遭到美帝国主义者暗杀以后，苏修报刊拚命搜罗和传布美国官方围绕这个事件散布的骗人鬼话，为美帝国主义统治集团推卸罪责。它们按照美国政府的调子，对约翰逊、汉弗莱等人对马丁·路德·金的被杀害如何感到“悲伤”和“耻辱”，都一一大加宣扬。四月十一日，苏修报刊甚至在《进步的美国在哀悼》的标题下，把约翰逊出席为马丁·路德·金举行的教堂祈祷、美国副总统汉弗莱参加葬礼、白宫决定下半旗“致哀”等美国统治集团的骗人花招，都当作美国统治集团对黑人的“同情”和“支持”加以大肆宣传。
    苏修报刊在谈到改变美国黑人贫困和无权地位问题时，竭力兜售通过“议会民主”就可以“和平”解决黑人问题的修正主义黑货，宣扬什么只要“要求
  （美国）政府和国会采取措施”就可以“改善黑人状况”之类的天方夜谭式的神话。美国参议院四月十日通过了一纸笼络、欺骗黑人的所谓“民权”法案以后，苏修如获至宝，立即为美帝捧场，宣扬什么这个法案“禁止在出售和出租住宅方面的种族歧视”，是美国统治集团的“让步”。在这期间，它们还特别把美国总统御用工具“民众骚乱特别谘询委员会”很早以前搞出的一个报告端了出来。这个报告建议美国当局采取某些“改革”措施，以缓和美国黑人的斗争，其欺骗性是很明显的。可是，苏修《劳动报》四月七日的一篇文章，却说什么这个报告是“清醒的”，报告中的建议是一项“认真的社会改革计划”；塔斯社四月十七日的报道还表示，这些“建议”有助于“消除”美国“种族争议和冲突的原因”。
    一贯反对美国黑人斗争，是美国黑人的死敌
    苏修领导集团对美国黑人抗暴斗争的这种叛徒行径，决不是偶然的，而是它们多年来充当美国垄断资产阶级的忠实帮凶、力图扑灭黑人革命斗争烈火的罪行的继续。
    一九六四年夏天，当美国广大黑人群众在纽约市哈莱姆区黑人的带动下，掀起了大规模武力抗暴斗争的时候，赫鲁晓夫集团曾赤裸裸地站在美国统治集团一边，反对那次黑人斗争。它们通过塔斯社，摆出一副殖民主义制度护法神的架势，破口大骂参加那次英勇斗争的黑人群众是什么“大叫大嚷的骚乱参加者”，污蔑这次斗争是什么“野蛮行为和暴力的勃发”，并攻击那些主张以革命暴力反击反革命暴力的黑人组织是所谓“极端主义组织”。另一方面，对美国反动当局则极尽谄媚之能事，大加赞扬美帝镇压黑人的法西斯手段，恭维说这是为了所谓“恢复城市的秩序和法制”等等。
    勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团完全继承了赫鲁晓夫的反革命衣钵，对美国黑人的斗争犯下了许多新的罪行，例如，一九六五年一月，美国亚拉巴马州塞尔马市的黑人，掀起了一场大规模的争取选举权的斗争，得到二十多个城市的黑人群众热烈支援和响应。在这期间，勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团却起劲地为约翰逊政府基于麻痹黑人斗志而提出的所谓“保证投票权”的“民权法案”大唱颂歌，帮助美国统治集团对黑人进行政治欺骗。它们宣扬约翰逊政府提出这个纯属空头支票的“法案”是“必要的”，它“禁止任何旨在剥夺人的投票权或者以种族和肤色为理由来减少这种权利的限制和程序”。塔斯社当时还宣传“约翰逊号召国会议员和参议员不分昼夜、不计假期地工作，以便通过关于保障黑人选举权利的法案”，拚命替镇压美国黑人斗争的这个头号刽子手涂脂抹粉。
    在美国黑人争取解放问题上，反帝同样必须反修
    当年，伟大的列宁在揭露第二国际的大叛徒考茨基时，曾经援引费尔巴哈的话，一针见血地指出：“谁要是安慰奴隶，而不去发动他们起来反对奴隶制，谁就是奴隶主的帮凶。”美国统治集团长期来对美国黑人斗争除了施行暴力镇压一手外，还一贯玩弄政治欺骗一手，企图把美国黑人斗争纳入非暴力主义的轨道，用所谓“和平改革”的幻想，破坏美国黑人争取解放和自由的斗争。苏修领导集团多年来在美国黑人问题上的所作所为充分证明，它们不折不扣地充当了美帝国主义扑灭美国黑人斗争烈火的头号帮凶。反帝必须反修。美国黑人要取得彻底解放，推翻美国垄断资产阶级的反动统治，就必须不断识破苏修反革命的面目，同全世界革命人民一道坚决反对现代修正主义。
