The revolutionary leading group of the Sand City Fruit Preserve Factory in Huailai County, Hebei Province, with an unyielding class sentiment of loyalty to Chairman Mao, has, in the face of a small leadership team and few administrative personnel, focused on studying Chairman Mao's works, promoting ideological revolution, and transforming into a combat-ready revolutionary command center that emphasizes proletarian politics.

After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, the leading group faced a small leadership team, few administrative personnel, and a multitude of tasks. How should they prioritize? The revolutionary leading group of the Sand City Fruit Preserve Factory has provided some good experiences in this regard.

With the help of the People's Liberation Army, the revolutionary leading group of the Sand City Fruit Preserve Factory organized extensive study sessions on Mao Zedong Thought, fostering a deep class sentiment of eternal loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. They actively applied Mao Zedong Thought, consciously took the path of emphasizing politics, eliminated the phenomenon of excessive personnel, prevented the growth of bureaucratic weeds, resisted the infiltration of bourgeois ideology, and transformed the revolutionary leading group into a combat-ready command center that emphasizes proletarian politics, is full of revolutionary spirit, acts decisively, and maintains close ties with the masses.

	Eternal Loyalty to Chairman Mao, Exercising Power for the Revolution

This unit consists of the Fruit Preserve Factory, the Storage and Transportation Station, and the Food Management Department. Among the 240 employees of the three departments, the vast majority are residents and family members of employees from nearby neighborhoods. They work in the factory during the day and return home in the evening, making it inconvenient for centralized leadership and study. After the establishment of the revolutionary leading group, the number of leading cadres was reduced from eight to four, and some production and business departments were streamlined.

Facing a large-scale operation, dispersed personnel, and numerous tasks, but with a small leadership team, what should be prioritized and how should it be handled? The revolutionary leading group believed that among countless tasks, the first is to actively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. No matter how busy the work is, the emphasis on proletarian politics should not waver; among countless important matters, the most important is to focus on the ideological revolution of the leading group. This is a top priority for the proletariat to exercise power correctly. They placed the study of Mao Zedong's works and his latest directives at the forefront. When assigning tasks, they first arranged for leading cadres to study Mao Zedong's works; when inspecting work, they first checked how leading cadres implemented Mao's latest directives; when reporting work, they first reported on how leading cadres fought against selfishness and promoted ideological revolution; when summarizing work, they first summarized the experiences of leading cadres in emphasizing proletarian politics. They also established an unbreakable "Daily Reading" system and regularly held study and application meetings. They ensured that even with tight schedules, they would not be deterred; with heavy tasks, they would not be overwhelmed; and with low cultural levels, they would not be discouraged.

The revolutionary leading group of the Fruit Preserve Factory believed that loyalty is shown through actions. Loyalty to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line must be demonstrated through action. "Regarding Marxist theory, one must master it and apply it, and the purpose of mastery is entirely for application." Loyalty to Chairman Mao means using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, implementing Mao's revolutionary theories, lines, policies, and directives, and following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments. They proposed the slogans "Study and apply Mao Zedong Thought to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat" and "Study and apply Mao Zedong Thought to continue the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat." They closely linked the sentiment of loyalty with the correct exercise of power, using "loyalty" to exercise power. Wang Fu, who had previously been a warehouse keeper and is now the head of the revolutionary leading group, brought out his "selfishness" in the study class and said, "Everyone elected me as the head, but I always felt that managing fresh fruits was easier, and now the burden is too heavy and the risk is too great. If things go wrong, I will be the first to be criticized in the next revolutionary movement; facing any situation, I am hesitant and cannot get out of the circle of 'selfishness,' forgetting about 'power.' This is the greatest disloyalty to Chairman Mao. Now I have realized that under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the revolution must continue, constantly overthrowing the class enemies and constantly overthrowing the 'selfishness' in our minds. Only then can the power be firmly grasped by the proletariat, ensuring that our country remains red for generations to come."

	Firmly Grasp Class Struggle, Concentrate Forces, and Launch a Decisive Battle Against the Revisionist "People's War" of Chinese Khrushchev

Great teacher Chairman Mao teaches us: "Never forget class struggle." After the establishment of the revolutionary leading group of the Fruit Preserve Factory, they firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teachings, first focusing on class struggle and line struggle, leading revolutionary employees to firmly grasp the direction of the struggle. With the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, they continuously carried out revolutionary criticism and struggle, eliminating all interference, and always directing the spearhead of the struggle against Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the party and their agents. With a decisive attitude, they continuously launched attacks against the class enemies. This unit was previously a black model cultivated by Chinese Khrushchev and his local lackeys; the capitalist roaders in this unit were praised and trusted by Chinese Khrushchev's local agents for promoting the revisionist lines of "profit-first" and "material incentives." The influence of Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist line in this unit was significant and deeply rooted. The revolutionary leading group believed that whether or not to focus on revolutionary criticism is a major issue concerning whether there is a class struggle consciousness, whether proletarian politics are emphasized, and whether Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments can be followed and his latest directives can be fully implemented.

During the revolutionary criticism process, they adopted the methods of finding problems together, thinking of solutions together, and attacking fortresses together. They held investigation meetings, consulted with the masses, and collectively analyzed the new characteristics of class struggle in the new situation. Using Chairman Mao's latest directives as a weapon, they launched four major annihilation campaigns: first, they smashed the class enemies' economic opportunism "sugar-coated bullets"; second, they encircled and eliminated bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, strengthening proletarian party spirit; third, they fiercely criticized Chinese Khrushchev's "money-first" and "material incentives," thoroughly breaking the idea of "working for money," and establishing the thought of working for revolution with one's heart in the workshop and mind on the world; fourth, they strongly opposed anarchism and strengthened socialist labor discipline. They always directed their struggle against Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, distinguishing between enemy and non-enemy contradictions. This deepened everyone's hatred for Chinese Khrushchev, deepened their limitless love for Chairman Mao, promoted ideological revolution, and further understood what socialism is, what capitalism is, what Marxism is, and what revisionism is.

Class struggle, once grasped, works wonders; emphasizing proletarian politics makes everything smooth. In this decisive battle against economic opportunism, due to the concentrated target, all forces were organized and mobilized, forming a fist and striking at one point, powerfully striking Chinese Khrushchev, smashing the class enemies' sabotage plots, and making the broad revolutionary employees establish the communist thought of not seeking fame or profit, doing more work, taking less remuneration, and dedicating themselves to the public. Revolutionary leading cadres deeply felt: "Grasping here and there, grasping sesame seeds and losing watermelons. Everyone grasps class struggle, and everything can be illuminated by the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought."

	Insist on the Mass Line, Maintain Close Ties with the Masses, and Deeply Root Among the Masses

Chairman Mao said: "Communist Party members must never detach themselves from the masses, must never stand above the masses, acting like officials and lords, but should appear before the masses as ordinary laborers, deeply rooted among the masses, and blend with the masses."

With the help of the leftist support personnel, the revolutionary leading group realized that the most fundamental aspect of reforming the revolutionary leading organs is to maintain close ties with the masses. Although the leading organs have been reduced and administrative personnel have been streamlined, as long as each leading member deeply roots among the masses, never detaches from the masses, accepts the supervision of the masses, and collects the opinions, wisdom, and experiences of the masses, they can forever maintain the character of the working people, always represent the interests of the masses, and exercise power correctly for the proletariat. They established systems for cadres to participate in labor, go to workshops and teams for point-to-point work, and so on. Except for meetings and study sessions, leading cadres labor, study, and engage in self-criticism with the workers every day. Each cadre considers correctly treating oneself, correctly treating the masses, and maintaining close ties with the masses as an important part of achieving ideological revolution. They paid great attention to removing the dust of detachment from the masses and proposed three unchanging principles for themselves: changing positions does not change the feelings of the working class; changing jobs does not change the character of the working people; changing workplaces does not change the style of maintaining ties with the masses. Where there are more problems, go there; where there are more tasks, work there. When transporting and adjusting products, they worked with the workers to load and unload. When business was busy, they assisted the workers. When encountering temporary errands, the members of the leading group all pitched in, often finishing the work before the workers knew it.

The revolutionary leading group followed Chairman Mao's teachings on "We communists are not here to be officials, but to make revolution," "We must insist on the mass line, consult with the masses on every matter, and be the students of the masses." They often criticized and repudiated the wrong thoughts of "not being satisfied with the masses," "not trusting the masses," and "not believing the masses." They respectfully regarded the masses as their teachers, humbly and sincerely accepted the masses' criticisms and help, improved the work style of the leading group, and established the thought of letting the masses exercise power correctly. Guo Yuwei, a member of the revolutionary leading group responsible for production, felt that issuing certificates (sick leave, leave of absence, receipts) was a critical task that he had to handle personally. He issued certificates during work, after work, and even at night when he was sleeping. Later, some employees criticized him, saying he was a "certificate-issuing cadre." He then studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "the masses are the true heroes" with this issue in mind, realizing that whether or not to rely on the masses to exercise power is a matter of trusting or not trusting the masses, and it concerns whether the revolutionary power can be consolidated. The masses know each other best, have the richest experiences, and the most ingenious methods, while he often appears naive and laughable. Later, he delegated the task of issuing certificates to the workshops and encouraged the masses to manage and educate themselves, freeing himself to focus on politics.

	Deeply Root Among the Masses, Cultivate Models, and Change Generalized Leadership

After the establishment of the revolutionary leading group, some leading members were satisfied with general upward and downward communication, walking around, and visiting, seemingly grasping a lot and comprehensively, but actually not grasping the essence. To address these issues, they repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "Any leading cadre who does not gain specific experiences from individual units and individual persons must not be able to provide universal guidance to all units." They realized that concrete facts are visible and tangible, and most convincing. Only with general calls and no specific guidance, without breaking through a point and gaining experience, work will become generalized and may be tainted with bureaucratic tendencies. The members of the revolutionary leading group, in their actual work, ensured that the more surface problems there were, the more they focused on models; the more there were tasks and fewer people, the more they concentrated on models; the heavier the tasks and the more urgent the work, the more they quickly focused on models. They relied on living models to inspire the masses to consciously emphasize politics. They addressed the various ideological problems that existed among the masses and mobilized the masses to establish nine models that emphasized proletarian politics. Among these models, there were models of self-criticism and criticism of others; pioneers of revolution and production; thrifty revolutionary managers; and everywhere-red propagandists of Mao Zedong Thought. On this basis, the leading group further cultivated models of learning from models, summarized experiences of learning from advanced deeds, paved the way for promoting models, built ladders, and quickly spread the experiences of models across the board.

After the revolutionary mass organizations in this place achieved great unity, the ghosts of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism had not been dispelled, and the roots had not been eliminated. Some even proposed dividing production teams by faction, resulting in leading cadres standing idle, masses scattered, and production slacking. How to uproot the roots of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism? Zhang Wenxia, the deputy head of the revolutionary leading group, recalled her experience of forming a "Red Group" with two comrades who had different views, thoroughly uprooting the roots of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and achieving unity. She believed that through class education and recalling bitterness and sweetness, it is the best way to thoroughly overthrow bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. Zhang Wenxia decided to cultivate a "Red Group" model and promote it throughout the factory. After several investigations, she discovered Liu Xiaoying, Dong Shun'e, and Li Shuxian, three workers whose lives were entangled by the poisonous snake of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, like bitter gourds on the same vine, had become sworn enemies. Zhang Wenxia then helped the three form a "Red Group," labored and studied with them for several days, and shared her experiences with them, guiding them to recall bitterness together. Liu Xiaoying recalled the class hatred of her mother being stabbed to death by the Nationalist bandits with bayonets; Dong Shun'e recalled her father's bitter experience of selling her as a child bride with tears in his eyes; Li Shuxian recalled her father's miserable experience of being a child apprentice to a private merchant, suffering beatings and curses every day. Through recalling bitterness, they all said, "We are all children of poor peasants. Without Chairman Mao, there would be no today for the three of us. In the past, Chinese Khrushchev used the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie to cut us into three factions, but today, the red thread of Mao Zedong Thought has tightly bound us together again." The three became closer through recalling bitterness, united as one, and jointly criticized Chinese Khrushchev.

The revolutionary leading group promoted this "Red Group" model throughout the factory, which played a significant role in helping all employees overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and enhance unity. (With picture)

After the publication of Chairman Mao's latest directives on revolutionary committees, the Party Committee of the 4699th Unit immediately organized the troops to study and discuss, and sent Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to deeply penetrate into communes, schools, fields, and streets for propaganda.

    千头万绪　把活学活用毛泽东思想放在首位  人少事多　紧紧依靠群众改变一般化的领导
    河北怀来县沙城果脯厂革命领导小组，怀着对毛主席无限忠诚的阶级感情，在领导班子小，办事人员少的情况下，狠抓毛主席著作学习，搞好思想革命化，成为突出无产阶级政治的战斗的革命指挥部
    本报讯　革命委员会建立后，领导班子小，办事人员少，工作千头万绪，怎么抓根本？河北省怀来县沙城果脯厂革命领导小组在这方面提供了一些好经验。
    沙城果脯厂革命领导小组，在解放军帮助下，大办毛泽东思想学习班，怀着永远忠于伟大领袖毛主席的深厚阶级感情，活学活用毛泽东思想，自觉走突出政治的道路，克服了人浮于事的现象，防止了官僚主义莠草的滋生，抵制了资产阶级思想的侵袭，使革命领导小组成为突出无产阶级政治，充满革命干劲，雷厉风行，同群众保持密切联系的战斗指挥部。
  永远忠于毛主席，为革命掌好权、用好权
    这个单位是由果脯厂、储运站、副食品经理部组成的。三个部门的二百四十名职工，绝大部分是来自附近街道的居民和职工家属。上班在厂，下班回家，不便于集中领导和学习。革命领导小组建立以后，领导干部由过去的八个人减少到四个人，有些生产业务机构也进行了精简。
    面临着摊子大、人员分散、工作千头万绪，而领导成员又少的情况，抓什么？怎么抓？革命领导小组认为，任务千条万条，活学活用毛泽东思想是第一条，工作再忙，突出无产阶级政治不动摇；千重要，万重要，狠抓领导班子的思想革命化最重要。这是关系到无产阶级掌好权、用好权的头等大事。他们把活学活用毛主席著作和毛主席一系列最新指示放在首位。他们布置工作，首先布置领导干部自己的毛主席著作学习；检查工作，首先检查领导干部自己落实毛主席最新指示的情况；汇报工作，首先汇报领导干部自己斗私批修，促进思想革命化的情况；总结工作，首先总结领导干部突出无产阶级政治的经验。他们还建立了雷打不动的“天天读”制度，定期召开讲用会。做到了时间紧，挤不倒；任务重，压不倒；文化低，难不倒。
    果脯厂革命领导小组认为，忠不忠，看行动。忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，要通过“用”来体现。“对于马克思主义的理论，要能够精通它、应用它，精通的目的全在于应用。”忠于毛主席就是要用毛泽东思想统帅一切，把毛主席的革命理论、路线、方针、政策切实贯彻下去，才能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。他们提出“为巩固无产阶级政权而活学活用”，“为在无产阶级专政下继续革命而活学活用”的口号。他们把心怀一个
  “忠”字和掌好一个“权”字紧密地联系在一起，靠
  “忠”字掌权。过去曾当过保管员、现在担任革命领导小组组长的王甫同志，在学习班里把自己的“私”字端了出来，他说：“大伙选我当组长，我总感到不如原来管点干鲜水果省劲，现在担子太重，风险太大，闹不好，下次的革命运动第一个挨整的就是我；一事当前，患得患失，跳不出‘私’字的圈圈，忘记了‘权’字，这是对毛主席最大的不忠。现在我才认清了，无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命，要不断革阶级敌人的命，还要不断革自己头脑中‘私’字的命。这样印把子才能牢牢地掌握在无产阶级手里，使我国千秋万代不变颜色。”
      狠抓阶级斗争，集中力量，打好围歼
  中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义的“人民战争”
    伟大导师毛主席教导我们：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”。果脯厂革命领导小组成立以后，牢牢记住毛主席的教导，首先狠抓阶级斗争和路线斗争，带领革命职工牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，持续地开展革命大批判，排除一切干扰，始终把斗争的锋芒指向中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派及其代理人。以雷厉风行的战斗姿态，不断地向阶级敌人冲锋陷阵。这个单位过去是中国赫鲁晓夫及其本地区黑爪牙培植的黑典型、黑样板；这个单位的走资派因为推行修正主义的“利润挂帅”、“物质刺激”有功，深受中国赫鲁晓夫在本地区代理人的赏识和重用。中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义路线在这个单位影响很大，流毒很深。革命领导小组认为，抓不抓革命的大批判，是有没有阶级斗争观念，是不是突出无产阶级政治，能不能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席最新指示的重大问题。
    在革命的大批判过程中，他们采取了问题大家找、办法大家想、堡垒大家攻的方法，开调查会，和群众商量，群策群力，分析新形势下阶级斗争的新特点，以毛主席最新指示为武器，先后开展了较大的四次歼灭战：一、粉碎了阶级敌人反革命经济主义“糖衣炮弹”的进攻；二、围剿资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性；三、狠批中国赫鲁晓夫“金钱挂帅”“物质刺激”的黑货，大破“做工为挣钱”的私心，树立身在车间，胸怀世界，为革命做工的思想；四、大反无政府主义，加强社会主义劳动纪律。他们斗争的矛头始终指向中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人，并区别了敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾。使大家加深了对中国赫鲁晓夫的仇恨，加深了对毛主席的无限热爱，促进了思想革命化，进一步懂得了什么是社会主义，什么是资本主义，什么是马克思主义，什么是修正主义。
    阶级斗争一抓就灵，突出无产阶级政治一通百通。在这次痛击反革命经济主义的歼灭战中，由于目标集中，把一切力量组织动员起来，攥成了一个拳头，打在了一个点子上，有力地痛击了中国赫鲁晓夫，粉碎了阶级敌人破坏阴谋，广大革命职工树立了不为名，不为利，多干工作，少取报酬，一心为公的共产主义思想。革命领导干部深有体会地说：“东抓一把，西抓一把，抓了芝麻，丢了西瓜。大家都来抓阶级斗争，就能用毛泽东思想的光辉把一切阵地照得红彤彤。”
      坚持群众路线，和群众保持密切联
  系，永远深深地扎根于群众之中
    毛主席说：“共产党员绝不可脱离群众，绝不可高踞于群众之上，做官当老爷，而应当以普通劳动者的姿态，出现在群众面前，深入于群众之中，同群众打成一片。”
    革命领导小组，在支左人员的帮助下，认识到：革命领导机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是密切联系群众。虽然领导机构小了，办事人员少了，但是，只要每个领导成员都深深地扎根于群众之中，一刻也不脱离群众，接受群众的监督，把群众的意见、智慧、经验集中起来，坚持下去，就能永远保持劳动人民的本色，时刻代表群众的利益，为无产阶级掌好权，用好权。他们制定了干部参加劳动，下到车间、班组蹲点等制度。领导干部除开会学习外，每天和工人同劳动，同学习，同讲用，同斗私批修。每个干部都把正确地对待自己，正确地对待群众，密切地联系群众，当作实现思想革命化的一条重要内容。他们十分注意扫除脱离群众的灰尘，对自己提出了“三不变”的要求：地位变了，工人阶级的感情不能变；职务变了，劳动人民的本色不能变；工作地点变了，联系群众的作风不能变。那里问题多，就到那里去；那里遇到活，就在那里干。运走、调来产品时，他们和工人一起装卸。业务忙了，他们就给工人当助手。遇到临时性的勤务公差，领导小组成员齐动手，常常是不等工人知道，就干完了。
    革命领导小组遵照毛主席关于“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命”，“要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生”的教导，经常大破自己头脑里对群众“不称心”、“不放心”、“不相信”的错误思想。恭恭敬敬地拜群众为师，做群众的小学生，虚心诚恳地接受群众的批评和帮助，改进领导班子的工作作风，树立让群众掌好权、用好权的思想。革命领导小组成员郭玉怀负责生产工作，他觉得开条子（病条、假条、领条）是个把关口的工作，非要自己一手经管不可。他上班开条子，下班开条子，就连晚上睡觉还有人找他开条子。后来有些职工批评了他，说他是“开条子干部”。他便带着这个问题学习了毛主席“群众是真正的英雄”的教导，认识到敢不敢依靠群众掌权、用权是相信不相信群众的问题，是关系到革命政权能不能巩固的问题。群众相互最了解，群众的经验最丰富，群众的办法最高明，自己往往是幼稚可笑的。以后，他就把开条子的事情，下放到车间，并且启发群众自己管理自己，自己教育自己，而他也就腾出手来抓政治了。
    深入群众，培养典型，改变
          一般化的领导
    革命领导小组成立以后，有的领导成员，满足于一般的上传下达，遛遛转转，跑跑看看，好象抓得很多，很全面，其实抓的不深，没有抓住根本。针对这些问题，他们反复学习了毛主席“任何领导人员，凡不从下级个别单位的个别人员、个别事件取得具体经验者，必不能向一切单位作普遍的指导”的教导，认识到：典型的事实，大家看得见，摸得着，最能说服人。只有一般号召，没有个别指导，不突破一点，取得经验，工作就会一般化，还会沾染官僚主义的作风。革命领导小组的成员在实际工作中做到了：面上的问题越多，越是抓典型；越在事多人少的情况下，越是集中力量抓典型；任务越重，工作越急，越是赶紧抓典型。他们依靠活样板启发群众自觉地突出政治。他们针对群众中普遍存在的各种思想问题，发动群众树立了突出无产阶级政治的九个典型。在这些典型中，有斗私批修的模范；有抓革命、促生产的先锋；有节约闹革命的红管家；还有处处红的毛泽东思想宣传员。在这个基础上，领导小组又培养出学典型的典型，总结出学先进事迹的经验，为推广典型铺平道路，搭好梯子，使典型的经验在面上迅速生根、开花、结果。
    这里的群众组织实现了革命大联合以后，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性阴魂未散，劣根未除。有人甚至提出要按派别分生产小组，形成了领导干部呆着，群众散着，生产松着的现象。怎样把资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的根子挖掉呢？革命领导小组副组长张文霞同志，回忆了她同观点不同的另外两个同志结成“一组红”，狠挖资产阶级、小资产阶级派性根子，搞好团结的经过。认为通过阶级教育，忆苦思甜，是彻底打倒资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的最好办法。张文霞决心培养“一组红”典型，推广全厂。她经过三番五次的调查研究，发现了刘孝英、董顺娥、李淑贤三个工人，由于资产阶级、小资产阶级派性这条毒蛇缠住了身，一条藤上的苦瓜，却成了冤家对头。张文霞同志便帮助她们三个结成了“一组红”，一连几天同她们一起劳动，一起学习，并把自己的经验传给她们，引导她们一起忆苦思甜。刘孝英回忆了国民党匪军用刺刀活活挑死她母亲的阶级仇恨；董顺娥回忆了她父亲含着眼泪把她卖给人家当童养媳的苦难经历；李淑贤回忆了她父亲从小就给私商当学徒，天天挨打受骂的悲惨遭遇。通过忆苦，她们都说：“我们都是贫下中农的子女，没有毛主席就没有我们三姊妹的今天。过去中国赫鲁晓夫用资产阶级反动路线的刀子把我们分割成了三派，今天是毛泽东思想的红线又把我们紧紧连在了一起。”三个人越忆越亲，团结一致，同批中国赫鲁晓夫。
    革命领导小组在全厂推广了这个“一组红”的典型，对全厂职工克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强团结，起了很大的推动作用。（附图片）
