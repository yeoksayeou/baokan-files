Old Xu, the former manager of the Dongliao County Wine Factory in Jilin Province, was elected as the head of the factory's revolutionary committee. With the help of a propaganda team from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, he replaced the "fear" with "dare" and the "self" with "public," establishing a spirit of responsibility to the people. However, after some time, his old habits resurfaced. In his work, he often took on too much himself, conducted few collective studies, issued many orders, and listened to the masses' opinions less frequently.

After discovering this situation, the propaganda team members believed this trend was wrong. They went to Xu to study Chairman Mao's teachings on "cultivating the democratic style of listening to the masses' opinions" together. They introduced advanced examples from the military of promoting democracy and helped him engage in self-criticism and criticism of revisionism. Through this study, Xu realized that whether to listen to the masses' opinions is a matter of attitude towards the revolutionary masses. Whether to fully promote democracy is a major issue related to implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Only by fully promoting democracy can the enthusiasm of the broad masses be mobilized, making the cadres and masses united as one, focusing their thoughts and efforts on implementing Chairman Mao's latest directives, and continuously consolidating and developing the revolutionary committee.

After raising his awareness, Xu paid attention to promoting democracy both within the revolutionary committee and among the masses, consulting with them on every matter.

Soon after the establishment of the revolutionary committee, due to the influence of anarchist trends in society, the factory's production failed to meet state standards. Old Xu thought that since the revolutionary committee was established, it was an opportunity to restart and boost production. Thus, he busied himself running around, personally handling tasks, even personally running errands for procurement. However, production still did not improve.

Later, he considered holding a special production meeting to improve regulations and measures. But upon second thought, he realized this was the bad habit of "individual decision-making." Therefore, he followed Chairman Mao's teaching on "cultivating the democratic style of listening to the masses' opinions" and went among the masses to listen to their opinions. The masses said: To boost production, the most fundamental thing is to emphasize proletarian politics, hold extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and solve the problem of people's ideological revolutionization. The masses' opinions cleared Xu's mind and clarified the direction. The revolutionary committee immediately held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes in the factory, organizing everyone to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's series of latest directives. The workers quickly raised their class consciousness and strengthened their organizational discipline, making production reach the highest level in history.

    老徐自己整天四处奔忙，想把生产搞上去，不见效果。没有多久，生产达到了历年最高水平，原因何在呢？
    走突出政治、依靠群众的道路
    吉林省东辽县酒厂原厂长徐步友，被选为厂革委会主任后，在解放军某部毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，把“怕”字换成“敢”字，把“私”字换成“公”字，树立了向人民负责的精神。但时间一长，他的老毛病又犯了。在工作中个人包办多，集体研究少；发号施令多，听取群众意见少。
    宣传队的同志发现这种情况以后，认为这个苗头不对。于是，他们便去找徐步友，同他一起学习毛主席“必须养成善于听取群众意见的民主作风”的教导，向他介绍了部队发扬民主的先进事迹，并和他一起斗私批修。通过学习，徐步友认识到听不听群众意见，这是对待革命群众的态度问题。能不能充分发扬民主，是关系到贯彻执行毛主席革命路线的大事情。只有充分的发扬民主，才能把广大群众的积极性调动起来，使干部和群众拧成一股绳，心往落实毛主席最新指示上想，劲往落实毛主席最新指示上使，使革命委员会不断地巩固和发展。
    徐步友提高认识后，无论在革委会内，还是在群众中，都注意发扬民主，遇事和群众商量。
    革委会成立后不久，由于社会上无政府主义思潮的影响，这个厂的生产一度达不到国家指标。老徐想，革委会成立了，应该趁此机会重打锣鼓另开张，把生产搞上去。于是他整天四处奔忙，亲自动手，甚至连采购工作都要亲自跑一跑。但是，生产仍然上不去。
    后来他想专门开个生产会议，好好健全一下规章制度，规定几条措施。但转念一想，这又是“个人说了算”的坏作风，于是他就按照毛主席“必须养成善于听取群众意见的民主作风”的教导，到群众中去，听取群众的意见。群众说：要使生产上去，最根本的是突出无产阶级政治，大办毛泽东思想学习班，解决人的思想革命化的问题。群众的意见使老徐清醒了头脑，明确了方向。革委会立即在厂内大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，组织大家反复学习毛主席的一系列最新指示。工人们很快提高了阶级觉悟，大大加强了组织纪律性，使生产达到了历年最高水平。
