Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Holding study classes is a good method. Many problems can be solved in study classes." Following Chairman Mao's instructions, the High West Gully Production Brigade in Gaogou Commune, Mishi County, Shaanxi Province, has held study classes to strengthen class education and class struggle education among cadres, timely overcoming the rightist opportunism and slack attitudes of a few cadres, and making revolution and production flourish.

The High West Gully Brigade is one of the advanced agricultural units in the country modeled after Dazhai. Since the leadership was re-elected in February last year, the brigade has consistently held a night school for studying Chairman Mao's works (later changed to a Mao Zedong Thought part-time study class), greatly raising the class consciousness of cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants, deepening their class feelings of limitless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, and infusing this love into revolution and production. They criticize the bourgeoisie every day and every month, strengthening the concept of class struggle. All cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants have maintained high class vigilance and high production enthusiasm. Last year, despite four consecutive severe natural disasters, the grain yield increased by 23.8 percent over the highest level in history in 1964, completing the public surplus grain delivery task by more than double, and the reserve grain for one year equaled four times the total of the past ten years.

However, since this spring, a few cadres have shown signs of arrogance, and the revolutionary criticism has stopped for a while. The start of spring plowing and production was delayed by half a month compared to the same period last year. At this time, the brigade leader Jiang Chunliang had just returned from a county revolutionary committee meeting and was shocked by this situation. After an investigation, he found that some cadres had become complacent and overly optimistic in the face of good conditions. They said: "The handful of capitalist roaders within the party have been overthrown, and the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists have been suppressed by the poor and lower-middle peasants. They no longer dare to cause trouble. Those who had previously taken the wrong side have now come over to our side, and there will be no more big problems in the future." Some even said: "Luo Ruihong is so far away from us. Criticizing him a bit will educate the community members, and that's enough." Seizing these active thoughts, Jiang Chunliang, together with the instructors of the study class, organized cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants to study Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle and related documents, raising the class consciousness of cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants.

Our great leader Chairman Mao says: "Because of victory, arrogance within the party, the attitude of considering oneself a hero, the attitude of stopping progress, the attitude of seeking enjoyment and not wanting to live a hard life, may grow." Chairman Mao also says: "Never forget class struggle." "Any thought that relaxes the will to fight and is complacent is wrong." Chairman Mao's teachings have made everyone clear-headed. Cadres have examined their own rightist opportunism and slack attitudes due to relaxed class vigilance and expressed their determination to put down the burden of arrogance and complacency and move forward lightly. They said, in the face of good conditions, whether to continue the revolution or stagnate is an important sign of loyalty to Chairman Mao. We are forever loyal to Chairman Mao. We will definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words, "Never forget class struggle," and continue the revolution to be thorough proletarian revolutionaries.

In the study class, many poor and lower-middle peasants, combined with the living facts of class struggle in their brigade, explained that the class enemies are still there, their hearts are not dead, and they are always ready to counterattack us. Once, the brigade suffered a hailstorm that occurs once in several decades, and the crops were beaten to the point of bare stalks and broken stems. The poor and lower-middle peasants were very sad to see this, while a few unrepentant landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists took the opportunity to spread rumors and rejoice in the misfortune. After the autumn harvest last year, when the entire brigade was busy preparing to deliver public surplus grain, these bad elements stirred up trouble from the dark corners, claiming to distribute the grain completely, saying nonsense like: "The People's Armed Forces Department of Mishi County is a red flag praised by the Central Committee for supporting the left. If we don't deliver the public surplus grain, this red flag will fall by itself." At that time, the poor and lower-middle peasants timely exposed the evil plots of the class enemies and suppressed their arrogance. After the new leadership of the brigade was established, the class enemies still secretly carried out activities, attempting to disintegrate the new leadership and achieve their evil goal of overthrowing the dictatorship of the proletariat. The living facts educated the brigade cadres. Some cadres deeply felt: "In the past, we looked at the complex class struggle too simply. Forgetting class struggle is forgetting our roots, and letting the enemy loose is betraying the people."

During the study and discussion, the cadres also recalled the scenes of charging at the bourgeois reactionary line at the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, igniting everyone's revolutionary spirit. Looking back at the past and the present, all cadres were emotionally moved and unanimously expressed their determination to carry forward the past spirit of thorough revolution, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

Currently, the High West Gully Brigade is once again bustling with activity. The revolutionary criticism has reached a new level, with people denouncing and attacking with their pens, hitting the vital points of Liu Shaoqi (referred to as the Chinese Khrushchev). Due to the tight schedule and numerous tasks of spring production, the poor and lower-middle peasants use the rest time in the fields to hold criticism meetings in the gullies and on the cliffs, successively criticizing Liu Shaoqi's series of revisionist black goods such as "three selfs and one package," "four freedoms," "peach garden experience," and "exploitation is meritorious."

Recently, the High West Gully Brigade has rectified the study class, determined to make it better, and turn High West Gully into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

### 听毛主席的话，千万不要忘记阶级斗争  克服右倾思想掀起革命大批判新高潮  米脂县高西沟大队干部社员向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，革命和生产热气腾腾

    听毛主席的话，千万不要忘记阶级斗争
    克服右倾思想掀起革命大批判新高潮
    米脂县高西沟大队干部社员向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，革命和生产热气腾腾
    本报讯　我们伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”陕西省米脂县高渠公社高西沟生产大队遵照毛主席的教导，通过举办学习班，加强对干部的阶级和阶级斗争教育，及时克服了少数干部流露出来的右倾轻敌思想和生产上的松劲情绪，使革命和生产搞得热火朝天。
    高西沟大队是全国大寨式农业先进单位之一。这个大队自去年二月改选领导班子后，坚持举办常年学习毛主席著作夜校（后改为毛泽东思想业余学习班），大大提高了干部和贫下中农的阶级觉悟，加深了对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的阶级感情，并且把对毛主席的热爱灌注到革命和生产中去。他们天天批判资产阶级，月月批判资产阶级，加强了阶级斗争的观念，全体干部和贫下中农始终保持着高度的阶级警惕性和高昂的生产热情。去年在连续四次严重自然灾害的情况下，粮食产量比历史上最高的一九六四年还增长百分之二十三点八，超额两倍以上完成了公余粮交售任务，一年的储备粮相当于过去十年总和的四倍。
    但是，今春以来，有少数干部产生了骄傲情绪，革命大批判一度停顿下来，春耕生产开工的时间比去年同期推迟了半个月。这时大队负责人姜纯亮正从县革委会开完常委会回来，看到这种现象心里很着急，一经调查，才知道有些干部在大好形势下麻痹大意，盲目乐观。他们说：党内一小撮走资派打倒了，地、富、反、坏、右分子经过贫下中农对他们加强专政后，再不敢乱说乱动了。原先站错队的社员现在都站了过来，今后再不会发生大问题了。有人还说：中国赫鲁晓夫离咱们这么远，批一批，让社员受受教育就行了，等等。抓住这些活思想，姜纯亮便同学习班的辅导员一起，组织干部和贫下中农学习毛主席关于阶级斗争的论述和有关文件，提高了干部和贫下中农的阶级觉悟。
    伟大领袖毛主席说：“因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪，可能生长。”毛主席又说：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争。”“任何松懈战斗意志的思想和轻敌的思想，都是错误的。”毛主席的教导，使大家心明眼亮。干部们纷纷检查了自己由于放松阶级警惕性而产生的右倾轻敌思想和松劲情绪，表示要放下骄傲自满的包袱，轻装前进。他们说，在大好形势下，是继续革命还是停滞不前，这是对毛主席忠不忠的重要标志。我们永远忠于毛主席，我们一定听毛主席的话，“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”，要不断革命，做彻底的无产阶级革命派。
    在学习班里，许多贫下中农结合本大队活生生的阶级斗争的事实，说明阶级敌人人还在，心不死，时刻准备着向我们进行反扑。有一次，这个大队遭受数十年不遇的雹灾，庄稼被打得叶光秆折，贫下中农们看到这种情况都很痛心。而一小撮没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，却乘机造谣惑众，幸灾乐祸。去年秋收以后，正当全大队男女老少忙着准备交售公余粮时，这些坏家伙从阴沟里刮起一股妖风，扬言要把粮食分光分净，胡说什么：“米脂县人民武装部是中央表彰的一面支左红旗，我们不给它交售公余粮，这面红旗就会不打自倒”。当时，贫下中农及时识破了阶级敌人的罪恶阴谋，把他们的嚣张气焰打了下去。大队新的领导班子建立后，阶级敌人还暗地进行活动，妄图瓦解新的领导班子，达到他们颠覆无产阶级专政的罪恶目的。活生生的事实，教育了大队干部。有的干部深有感触地说：“过去我们把复杂的阶级斗争看得太简单了。忘记阶级斗争，就是忘本，放纵了敌人，就是背叛了人民。”
    干部们在学习讨论中，还回忆了无产阶级文化大革命初期向资产阶级反动路线冲杀的情景，激发了大家的革命干劲。忆过去，看今朝，全体干部无不感情激动，一致表示要发扬过去那种大无畏的彻底革命精神，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    目前，高西沟大队又是一派热气腾腾的景象。革命大批判发展到一个新的水平，人人口诛笔伐，打中了中国赫鲁晓夫的要害。由于春季生产时间紧，活路多，贫下中农就利用田间休息的时间，在山沟和崖畔举行批判会，先后按专题批判了中国赫鲁晓夫推行的“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“桃园经验”、“剥削有功”等一系列修正主义黑货。革命的大批判推动了春季生产和其他各项工作，使生产和工作更上一层楼。
    最近高西沟大队整顿了学习班，决心把它办得更好，让高西沟变成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
