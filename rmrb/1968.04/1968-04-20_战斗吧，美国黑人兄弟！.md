Fight, American Black Brothers!

Stand Together and Fight with American Black Brothers

On April 16, our great leader Chairman Mao issued the "Statement in Support of the American Black People's Struggle Against Violence." We enthusiastically hail the great leader's statement. It is a beacon for the American Black people's struggle, a new call to arms and battle cry to the people of the world, and a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.

The surging American Black people's struggle against violence, in just one week, has quickly developed, throwing more than a hundred large and small cities in the United States into chaos, like a storm, shaking the foundations of U.S. imperialist reactionary rule. This storm is a prominent manifestation of the intensifying class contradictions within the United States, a prominent manifestation of the deepening political and economic crises of U.S. imperialism.

The storm of anti-U.S. sentiment among the people of the world is growing stronger. The armed revolutionary struggles of the people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are developing. The heroic Vietnamese people have defeated U.S. imperialism, leaving it in tatters. All this has surrounded U.S. imperialism in a sea of people's struggles. Now, the rise of the American Black people's struggle against violence has made this "giant" even more riddled with holes.

The American Black people's struggle and the global people's anti-U.S. struggle are mutually supportive and mutually promoting. The Chinese people have always regarded the struggle of American Black people as our own struggle and their victories as our victories. The oppressed people of the world are one family. The sufferings of American Black brothers are the same as ours in the past, all brought about by the exploitative system. U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Chinese people and American Black people, the common enemy of all the people of the world. The Chinese working class firmly supports the American Black brothers' struggle against violence, stands together with them, fights together with them, and will achieve victory together with them.

	We Swear to Be a Strong Backing for American Blacks

	The statement "Support the American Black People's Struggle Against Violence" issued by our great leader, the great teacher of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, is a new battle cry to mobilize the revolutionary people of the world to launch a sustained and fierce attack on U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.

	We workers of the Wuhan Heavy Machinery Factory will never forget the world revolution, regard the liberation cause of the people of the world as our own cause. We will support the American Black people's struggle against violence with actual actions of seizing the revolution and promoting production. We swear to be a strong backing for American Blacks, supporting the revolutionary struggles of all revolutionary people of the world. We are in the factory but have the world in our hearts. We will definitely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, spread the revolutionary spark throughout the world, and spread Mao Zedong Thought throughout the world.

	The American Black People's Struggle Against Violence Will Surely Win!

	The waves of the world revolution are surging. From the radio, we heard the words of our dearest red sun, our great leader Chairman Mao, "Support the American Black People's Struggle Against Violence." Chairman Mao's statement speaks the hearts of us poor and lower-middle peasants, most concisely and fully expressing the resolute determination of the 700 million Chinese people to support the American Black people's struggle against violence.

	U.S. imperialism is the sworn enemy of all the people of the world. On the battlefield in Vietnam, it has been defeated by the heroic Vietnamese people, left in a desperate and miserable state. In Asia, Africa, and Latin America, anti-U.S. struggles are burning everywhere. Within the United States, class struggles are becoming increasingly sharp, resulting in unprecedented serious political and economic crises. Now, U.S. imperialism is in a desperate situation, surrounded on all sides, having a hard time.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people who have already won revolutionary victories should aid the struggles of the people who are still striving for liberation. This is our internationalist duty." The broad poor and lower-middle peasants of Pingfang People's Commune have always been concerned about the American Black people's struggle against violence. Every victory of the American Black people's struggle has greatly encouraged us. We poor and lower-middle peasants will firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, seize the revolution, promote production, and strive for an all-around bumper harvest in agricultural production this year, supporting the American Black people's struggle against violence with actual actions.

	The People of the World Unite, Defeat U.S. Imperialism!

	The statement "Support the American Black People's Struggle Against Violence" issued by our great leader Chairman Mao is the greatest encouragement and support for the American Black people's struggle against violence. In the statement, Chairman Mao points out: "At present, the world revolution has entered a great new era. The struggle of the American Black people for liberation is a component part of the total struggle of the people of the world against U.S. imperialism, a component part of the world revolution today." The American Black people's struggle against violence has dealt a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism, thereby powerfully supporting the anti-U.S. struggles of the people of various countries.

	In the statement, Chairman Mao points out: "The people of the world should unite more closely, launch a sustained and fierce attack on our common enemy, U.S. imperialism, and its lackeys! It can be said with certainty that the thorough collapse of colonialism, imperialism, and all exploitative systems, and the thorough liberation of all oppressed peoples and nations, are not far off." When our "Liminhao" ship was docked in the port of Genoa, Italy, we fought for 23 days against the Italian reactionary authorities who served U.S. imperialism and opposed China. During the arduous struggle, we received strong support from the Italian people and seamen from other countries, and finally won the victory. We are firmly convinced that as long as the people of the world unite closely, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys will surely be defeated.

    战斗吧，美国黑人兄弟！
    同美国黑人兄弟团结战斗在一起
    四月十六日，我们伟大领袖毛主席发表了《支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明》。我们热烈欢呼伟大领袖的声明，它是美国黑人斗争的指路明灯，是向全世界人民发出的新的动员令、进军号，是对美帝国主义及其帮凶们的一个沉重打击。
    风起云涌的美国黑人抗暴斗争，在短短的一周中，迅速发展，使美国一百几十个大小城市陷于一片混乱，好象急风暴雨，震荡着美帝国主义反动统治的根基。这场风暴，是美国国内的阶级矛盾日益激化的突出表现，是美帝国主义的政治危机和经济危机日益加深的突出表现。
    全世界人民反美风暴越刮越猛。亚非拉地区人民的革命武装斗争日益发展。英雄的越南人民打得美帝国主义一败涂地。这一切，使美帝国主义陷入了全世界人民的重重包围之中。现在，美国黑人抗暴斗争的掀起，使美帝国主义这个“庞然大物”更加千疮百孔。
    美国黑人斗争和全世界人民反美斗争是相互支持、相互促进的。中国人民从来把美国黑人的斗争看成是自己的斗争，把美国黑人兄弟的胜利看成是自己的胜利。天下被压迫人民是一家。美国黑人兄弟所受的苦难，和我们过去所受的苦难一样，都是剥削制度给带来的。美帝国主义是中国人民和美国黑人的共同敌人，是全世界人民的共同敌人。中国工人阶级坚决支持美国黑人兄弟的抗暴斗争，与美国黑人兄弟团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。

    誓作美国黑人的坚强后盾
    我们的伟大领袖、世界革命人民的伟大导师毛主席发表的《支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明》，是动员世界革命人民向着美帝国主义及其帮凶们发动持久的猛烈进攻的新的战斗号令。
    我们武汉重型机床厂工人，一定念念不忘世界革命，把世界人民的解放事业，当做我们自己的事业。我们要用狠抓革命、猛促生产的实际行动，全力支持美国黑人的抗暴斗争，誓做美国黑人的坚强后盾，支持全世界一切革命人民的革命斗争。我们身在工厂，胸怀世界，一定要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把革命的火种传遍全世界，把毛泽东思想传遍全世界。

    美国黑人抗暴斗争必胜！
    四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激。在世界革命浪潮风起云涌的大好形势下，从广播里传来了我们心中最红的红太阳、我们的伟大领袖毛主席《支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明》。毛主席的声明，说出了我们贫下中农的心里话，最集中、最充分地表达了我们七亿中国人民坚决支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的坚强决心。
    美帝国主义是全世界人民的不共戴天的敌人。在越南战场上，它被英雄的越南人民打得走投无路，狼狈不堪。在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲，到处都在燃烧着反美斗争的烽火。美国国内，阶级斗争日趋尖锐，出现了空前严重的政治和经济危机。现在，美帝国主义正处于四面楚歌的狼狈境地，日子很不好过。
    毛主席教导我们：“已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争，这是我们的国际主义的义务。”我们平房人民公社的广大贫下中农，一直在关注着美国黑人的抗暴斗争，美国黑人斗争的每一个胜利都给了我们很大的鼓舞。我们贫下中农决心高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，狠抓革命，猛促生产，誓夺今年农业生产的全面大丰收，以实际行动来支援美国黑人的抗暴斗争。

    世界人民团结起来，打败美帝
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席发表的《支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明》是对美国黑人抗暴斗争的最大鼓舞、最大支持。毛主席在声明中指出：“当前，世界革命进入了一个伟大的新时代。美国黑人争取解放的斗争，是全世界人民反对美帝国主义的总斗争的一个组成部分，是当代世界革命的一个组成部分。”美国黑人抗暴斗争沉重地打击了美帝国主义，也就有力地支援了各国人民的反美斗争。
    毛主席在声明中指出：“全世界人民更紧密地团结起来，向着我们的共同敌人美帝国主义及其帮凶们发动持久的猛烈的进攻！可以肯定，殖民主义、帝国主义和一切剥削制度的彻底崩溃，世界上一切被压迫人民、被压迫民族的彻底翻身，已经为期不远了。”我们的“黎明号”船员在意大利热那亚港停泊的时候，曾同为美帝反华效劳的意大利反动当局进行了长达二十三天的斗争。在艰苦的斗争期间，我们得到了意大利人民和其他各国的海员的有力支援，最后取得了胜利。我们深信，只要全世界人民紧密地团结起来，美帝国主义及其帮凶们是一定可以打败的。
