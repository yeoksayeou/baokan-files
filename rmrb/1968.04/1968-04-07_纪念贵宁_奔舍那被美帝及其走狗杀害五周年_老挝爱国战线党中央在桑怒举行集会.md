The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front held a grand rally in Sam Neua on April 1 to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the assassination of Kaysone Phomvihane, former Foreign Minister of the Lao Three-Party National United Front Government, by the US imperialists and their lackeys.

Chairman Souphanouvong of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front and member of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee, Nouhak Phoumsavanh, attended the rally.

Khamphouane Duolang, State Secretary for Economic Planning of the Lao Three-Party National United Front Government, spoke on behalf of the Lao Patriotic Front. He said, "The passing of Kaysone Phomvihane is a great loss to the Lao patriotic and neutralist forces, and it is also a great loss to the Lao Patriotic Front and the revolutionary forces of the Lao people."

In discussing the favorable situation of the Lao people's struggle against US aggression for national salvation, Duolang pointed out that at present, the Lao people are in a position of victory, while the US imperialists and their lackeys are in a desperate and passive situation, taking blows. Seizing this favorable opportunity, we must strengthen our alliance with the patriotic and neutralist forces, launch broad and continuous attacks on the enemy, and achieve greater victories.

    新华社康开六日电　据巴特寮通讯社报道：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会一日在桑怒隆重地举行集会，纪念老挝三方民族团结政府前外交大臣贵宁·奔舍那被美帝国主义及其走狗杀害五周年。
    老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席苏发努冯，中央常务委员会委员诺哈·冯沙万等出席了集会。
    老挝三方民族团结政府经济计划国务秘书坎芬·杜纳龙代表老挝爱国战线党在会上讲了话。他说，“贵宁·奔舍那的逝世，是老挝爱国中立力量的重大损失，也是老挝爱国战线党和老挝人民革命力量的重大损失”。
    杜纳龙在谈到老挝人民抗美救国斗争的大好形势时指出，目前，老挝人民正处于胜利的优势，美帝国主义及其走狗正处于走投无路，被动挨打的困境。趁此大好时机，我们必须加强同爱国中立力量的联盟，广泛、连续地进攻敌人，夺取更大的胜利。
