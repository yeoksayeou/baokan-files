Chairman Mao recently pointed out deeply: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution under the conditions of socialism, where the proletariat opposes the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. It is a continuation of the long struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the revolutionary masses under its leadership against the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, the most dangerous enemy is the representative of the bourgeoisie who has infiltrated the Communist Party, waving the "red flag" to oppose the red flag, that is, a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. This group of counter-revolutionary two-faced characters, in order to restore capitalism in our country, must necessarily engage in reactionary mountainism in terms of organization and rally counter-revolutionary forces. They collude with the remaining Kuomintang reactionary remnants in society to make a desperate struggle.

Mountainism is reactionary. It is the ideology of the exploiting classes and the bourgeoisie, incompatible with communism, incompatible with the Party spirit, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought. Mountainism opposes proletarian dictatorship, stands against the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, and advocates independence. Therefore, class enemies always spread the poisonous ideas of mountainism within the revolutionary ranks and engage in small-group and factional activities. Opportunists within the Communist Party are all engaged in mountainism. Under the mighty force of infallible Mao Zedong Thought, their small groups have collapsed one by one. They all meet with bad ends. "Zhang Guotao advocated independence from the Party Central, resulting in his betrayal of the Party and becoming a spy." This is a typical example.

The revolutionary committees are organs of the proletarian dictatorship, not "liaison stations" for various small groups, nor "unions" of factions. The members of the revolutionary committees are representatives of the broad masses of the people. We must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "All words and deeds must take the greatest benefit to the broadest masses of the people and the support of the broadest masses of the people as the highest standard." If we only work for one faction, speak for one faction, and protect factional interests; if we appoint and trust only people from one faction; if we, when participating in external activities, favor one faction and alienate another, even support one faction and suppress another; if we, within the revolutionary committees, form factions, exclude members with different opinions, and so on, then we lose proletarian party spirit, damage the authority of the revolutionary committees, and may be exploited by class enemies.

Mountainism and factionalism are both exaggerated individualism. Their roots are the "self" of the exploiting classes and the bourgeoisie, opposing communism. Communist theory is vast, but the basic principle can be summarized as "destroying selfishness and establishing public spirit." The core of the communist worldview is the word "public." Comrades in the proletarian revolutionary ranks, while launching a fierce attack on the class enemy, we must continue to run well the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, study and apply Mao Zedong Thought actively, attack the enemy of the "self" in our minds, and thoroughly eliminate the soil on which mountainism and factionalism depend. Only in this way can we consolidate the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary ranks and expose all those counter-revolutionary two-faced characters, careerists, and conspirators who create small groups and cause splits.

### 打倒山头主义

专栏：各地报刊评论摘要

    打倒山头主义
    毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”在无产阶级专政条件下，最危险的敌人就是资产阶级钻进共产党内打着
  “红旗”反红旗的代表人物，即党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。这一伙反革命两面派，为了在我国复辟资本主义，就必然要在组织上大搞反动的山头主义，纠集反革命队伍。他们与社会上残留下来的国民党反动派余孽相勾结，进行垂死挣扎。
    山头主义是反动的。它是剥削阶级、资产阶级的意识形态，是同共产主义不相容的，是与共产党的党性不相容的，是反毛泽东思想的。山头主义是反对无产阶级专政的，是同以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部相对抗，闹独立性的。因此，阶级敌人总是在革命队伍中散布山头主义的思想毒素，总是在革命队伍中搞小山头、小团体活动。共产党内的机会主义者，都是搞山头主义的。在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的强大威力之下，他们的小山头一个一个都土崩瓦解了。他们都没有好下场。“张国焘是向党中央闹独立性的，结果闹到叛党，做特务去了。”这就是一个典型的例子。
    革命委员会，是无产阶级专政的政权机关，不是各个小山头的
  “联络站”，不是派别的“联合会”。革命委员会的成员，是广大人民群众的代表。我们要牢记毛主席的教导：“一切言论行动，必须以合乎最广大人民群众的最大利益，为最广大人民群众所拥护为最高标准。”如果我们只替那一派办事，为那一派说话，维护派别利益；如果任人唯亲，只选用和相信一派的人；在参加外面的活动时，如果亲一派、疏一派，甚至支一派、压一派；如果在革命委员会内部拉山头、搞派别、排挤有不同意见的成员，等等，这样就丧失了无产阶级党性，就损害了革命委员会的权威，就可能为阶级敌人所利用。
    山头主义、派性都是放大了的个人主义，都是膨胀了的个人主义。它们的根子都是剥削阶级、资产阶级的“私”字，是与共产主义相敌对的。共产主义的理论很多，基本原则可以概括为“破私立公”，共产主义世界观的核心就是一个“公”字。无产阶级革命派的战友们，在我们向阶级敌人开展猛烈进攻的同时，一定要继续办好毛泽东思想学习班，活学活用毛泽东思想，向自己头脑中“私”字这个敌人进攻，彻底扫除山头主义、派性等赖以生存的土壤。只有这样，才能巩固无产阶级革命派的大联合，才能把那些制造小山头，制造分裂的反革命两面派、野心家、阴谋家统统揪出来。
