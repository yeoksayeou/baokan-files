Chairman Ho Chi Minh has commended the military and civilians of Quang Binh Province for their outstanding achievements in the anti-American national salvation war.

In a letter dated April 9, Chairman Ho Chi Minh wrote, "Quang Binh is the first province to shoot down 100, 200, and 300 U.S. aircraft, and now it is the first to shoot down 400 U.S. aircraft. In terms of sinking and damaging enemy warships and patrol boats, Quang Binh is also in the forefront."

The letter noted that the three armed forces of Quang Binh have all grown stronger. Particularly, the militia and self-defense forces, including men, women, and children, have used light weapons to shoot down many U.S. aircraft; female militia members have used cannons to damage U.S. warships twice. Quang Binh has established great merits and has achieved outstanding results in all work serving the front line. Other aspects of work have also made significant progress.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh concluded the letter by calling on the military and civilians of Quang Binh to carry forward their victories, strive to learn from the heroic southern military and civilians, and compete with them. He urged them to resolutely foil all war conspiracies and actions of the U.S. aggressors, and to make due contributions to the sacred cause of defending the North, liberating the South, and reunifying the country.

According to a report from here, on April 9, the military and civilians of Quang Binh Province shot down one enemy aircraft while counterattacking invading U.S. air pirates.

Additionally, it was reported that on April 6, the military and civilians of this province also shot down one U.S. aircraft.
