	The spokesperson of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front issued a statement on April 19, strongly opposing the illegal action of the Indian and Canadian representatives of the International Control Commission in Laos, who conducted "inspections" in Saravane Province, Attapeu Province, and the Xam Neua region on April 12.

	The statement pointed out that the situation in Laos is becoming increasingly tense due to the intensified U.S. interference and escalation of the war of aggression against Laos. Currently, the Johnson administration is vigorously pushing forward the plot to expand the war of aggression to the entire Indochina Peninsula, which includes the scheme of launching new military adventures against Laos. To deceive public opinion and pave the way for the realization of the above plot, the Washington authorities and the Vientiane puppet regime are fabricating lies to slander the Lao Patriotic Front and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Indian and Canadian representatives, abusing the name of the International Control Commission, conducted "inspections" in Saravane Province, Attapeu Province, and the Xam Neua region, which is a part of this criminal activity.

	The statement said that the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front is authorized to declare that the "inspections" conducted by the Indian and Canadian representatives in Saravane Province, Attapeu Province, and the Xam Neua region are completely illegal. If the Indian and Canadian representatives insist on continuing their illegal actions to serve the policy of U.S. imperialism in strengthening the war of aggression against Laos, they must bear full responsibility for all the consequences that may arise from this.

    老挝爱国战线党中央委员会发言人发表声明
    谴责印度加拿大代表团为美帝侵略老挝效劳
    新华社康开二十四日电　据巴特寮通讯社报道：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会发言人十九日发表声明，坚决反对老挝国际委员会中的印度和加拿大代表团四月十二日又到沙拉湾省、阿速坡省和寮岸地区进行“视察”的非法行动。
    声明指出，老挝局势日趋紧张，是由于美国加紧干涉老挝和加强侵略老挝的战争所造成的。目前，约翰逊政府正在加紧推行把侵略战争扩大到整个印度支那的阴谋，其中包括对老挝进行新的军事冒险的阴谋。为了欺骗舆论并给实现上述阴谋开辟道路，华盛顿当局和万象伪政权正在大肆诬蔑老挝爱国战线党和越南民主共和国。印度和加拿大代表团滥用国际委员会的名义到沙拉湾省、阿速坡省和寮岸地区进行“视察”，就是这一罪恶活动的一个组成部分。
    声明说，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会发言人受权声明，印度和加拿大代表团对沙拉湾省、阿速坡省和寮岸地区进行的“视察”，是完全非法的。如果印度和加拿大代表团一味顽固地继续进行为美帝国主义加强侵略老挝战争的政策效劳的非法行动，他们必须对由此所造成的一切后果负全部责任。
