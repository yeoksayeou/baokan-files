The Soviet revisionist leadership has expressed great approval for the ascension of the Indonesian fascist military leader Suharto to the presidency.

The people of Indonesia and the people of the world all know clearly that Suharto is a faithful lackey of U.S. imperialism and a butcher whose hands are stained with the blood of Indonesian communists and revolutionary people. However, the mouthpiece of the Soviet revisionist leadership, *Pravda*, in its March 28 report on Suharto's "assumption of the presidency" and his "biography," not only fails to mention a single word about this reactionary leader's heinous crimes, but instead praises how "General Suharto" "participated in the liberation of West Irian," and boasts about his having held positions such as "prime minister," "acting president," and now being "appointed as the president of Indonesia."

The Soviet revisionist leadership's actions are not accidental. Soon after the right-wing military clique in Indonesia staged a counter-revolutionary coup in 1965, the Soviet revisionist leader Brezhnev quickly came out to assure these butchers that they would "develop" friendly relations with them. The Soviet clique has repeatedly fawned over these fascist leaders, praising them as "national leaders" and "revolutionary leaders." When Suharto climbed to the position of "acting president," the Soviet revisionist clique immediately expressed that they would "strive to further strengthen relations between Indonesia and the Soviet Union." The Soviets also actively followed the U.S. imperialists, providing the Suharto fascist military clique with large amounts of "economic aid" and "military aid," helping them to brutally suppress the Indonesian revolutionary people.

The fact that the Brezhnev and Kosygin clique have consistently supported the Indonesian fascist military clique fully demonstrates that the Soviet revisionists are faithful henchmen of U.S. imperialism and mortal enemies of the Indonesian people and revolutionary people of the world.

    苏修为苏哈托爬上总统宝座捧场喝采
    一再无耻吹捧印尼法西斯头目为“民族领袖”和“革命领导人”
    新华社讯　苏修领导集团对印尼法西斯军人集团头目苏哈托爬上总统宝座，表示十分赞赏。
    印尼人民和全世界人民都非常清楚，苏哈托是美帝国主义的忠实走狗，是双手沾满印尼共产党人和革命人民鲜血的刽子手。但是，苏修领导集团的喉舌《真理报》三月二十八日刊登的苏哈托“就任总统”的消息和苏哈托“小传”中，不仅只字不提这个反动头目的滔天罪行，相反却吹捧什么“苏哈托将军”“参加过解放西伊里安”，宣扬他担任过“内阁首脑”、“代总统”等等要职，现在“被任命为印尼总统”。
    苏修领导集团这样做并不是偶然的。还在印尼右派军人集团一九六五年发动反革命政变之后不久，苏修头目勃列日涅夫就赶紧出来向这伙刽子手们保证要“发展”同他们的“友好关系”。苏修集团还一再肉麻地把这些法西斯头目们吹捧为“民族领袖”和“革命领导人”。当苏哈托爬上“代总统”职位的时候，苏修集团又赶忙表示，“将致力于进一步密切印尼同苏联的关系。”苏修并积极追随美帝，向苏哈托法西斯军人集团提供了大量的“经济援助”和“军事援助”，帮助他们疯狂镇压印尼革命人民。
    勃列日涅夫、柯西金集团一贯卖力支持印尼法西斯军人集团的事实充分表明，苏修是美帝的忠实帮凶，是印尼人民和全世界革命人民的死敌。
