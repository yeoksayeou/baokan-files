More than a thousand revolutionary masses from the capital gathered at the airport on the evening of the 6th to warmly welcome Comrade Chen Jixian, a member of the Chinese aircraft inspection expert group who was unjustly expelled by the Soviet revisionist authorities, along with other members of the expert group, as they returned to our great motherland's capital, Beijing.

On the evening of the 6th, the capital airport presented a scene of anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist revolution. The revolutionary masses held up portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao, waved red flags, and shouted slogans such as "Down with American Imperialism!" and "Down with Soviet Revisionism!" They strongly protested the Soviet revisionist authorities' fabrication of absurd excuses to slander our expert group and unjustly expel Comrade Chen Jixian. They also strongly protested the Soviet revisionist authorities' deliberate sabotage of the trade agreements between China and the Soviet Union, further worsening the relations between the two countries. The revolutionary masses pointed out sternly that the Soviet revisionists' anti-China actions will meet a bad end.

Comrade Chen Jixian, holding a portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao, shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" as he stepped off the plane first. Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Luo Guibo, Vice Minister of Foreign Trade Li Qiang, and responsible comrades from the Civil Aviation Administration and other relevant departments went forward to shake hands warmly with Comrade Chen Jixian and other members of the expert group, expressing their cordial greetings. Representatives of the revolutionary masses from the capital pinned shiny Mao badges on the chests of the returning anti-revisionist warriors.

Following this, Comrade Chen Jixian and other members of the expert group, together with the welcoming crowd, waved their red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and together paid tribute to our most beloved red sun, Chairman Mao, wishing him eternal life! Eternal life! They read together Chairman Mao's teachings: "'Lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet,' is a Chinese saying used to describe the behavior of some fools. The reactionaries in various countries are also such a bunch of fools. The various persecutions they inflict on the revolutionary people will, in the final analysis, only promote more extensive and more intense revolution among the people."

As Comrade Chen Jixian and other members of the expert group passed through the welcoming crowd, the airport was filled with the sound of drums and gongs. The welcoming crowd continuously shouted: "Warmly welcome our anti-revisionist warriors back to the country!" "Learn from the anti-revisionist warriors! Pay tribute to the anti-revisionist warriors!" The anti-revisionist warriors also shouted together with everyone: "Down with American Imperialism! Down with Soviet Revisionism!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!"

    首都革命群众一千多人齐集机场慰问亲人
    热烈欢迎我反修战士光荣回京
    欢迎群众高呼“打倒美帝”“打倒苏修”，机场呈现一派反帝反修革命景象
    新华社九日讯　首都革命群众一千多人，六日晚上齐集首都机场，热烈欢迎被苏修当局无理驱逐出境的中国验收飞机专家组成员陈继贤同志，以及专家组的其他成员，光荣地回到我们伟大祖国的首都北京。
    六日晚，首都机场呈现一派反帝反修的革命景象。革命群众高举伟大领袖毛主席像，举着一面面红旗，高呼：“打倒美帝”“打倒苏修”等口号，强烈抗议苏修当局捏造荒唐借口，诬蔑我国专家组，并无理驱逐我专家组成员陈继贤同志，强烈抗议苏修当局蓄意破坏中苏两国的贸易协定，进一步恶化中苏两国关系的卑劣行径。革命群众严正指出，苏修反华绝没有好下场。
    陈继贤同志捧着伟大领袖毛主席像，高呼“毛主席万岁”，首先走下飞机。外交部副部长罗贵波，对外贸易部副部长李强，民航总局和其他有关方面的负责同志，迎上前去，同陈继贤同志和专家组其他同志热烈握手，向他们表示亲切慰问。首都革命群众的代表把金光闪闪的毛主席像章，佩戴在光荣归来的反修战士们的胸前。
    接着，陈继贤同志和专家组其他同志，同欢迎群众一起，挥动红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，共同敬祝我们心中最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！一起朗读毛主席的教导：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”
    陈继贤同志和专家组其他同志，从欢迎群众的行列前经过时，机场上锣鼓喧天。欢迎群众不断地高呼：“热烈欢迎我反修战士回国！”“向反修战士学习！向反修战士致敬！”反修战士也和大家一起高呼：“打倒美帝！打倒苏修！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
