The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam have each issued statements strongly condemning the U.S. imperialist bombing of Xam Neua and other areas in Laos.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi dated April 7, the spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on April 5, strongly condemning the savage bombing by U.S. imperialism of Xam Neua and Kheang Khay, as well as the bombing of the economic and cultural representative offices of Vietnam and China in Laos.

The statement said that after bombing Xam Neua, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys continued to dispatch multiple batches of aircraft on March 21 and 22 to savagely bomb and strafe Kheang Khay, killing many innocent civilians and destroying many homes and properties of the Laotian people. This is new evidence of U.S. imperialism's interference and aggression in Laos.

The statement condemned the Vientiane authorities, who colluded with U.S. imperialism, allowing U.S. aircraft to kill Laotian people and fly over Laotian airspace to attack Vietnam. The statement pointed out that the attacks on the economic and cultural representative offices of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the People's Republic of China are blatant provocations against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the People's Republic of China.

The statement pointed out that the recent brilliant victories of the Laotian patriotic military and people are a well-deserved punishment and severe warning to the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys. The just struggle of the fraternal Laotian people will surely achieve brilliant victories.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi dated April 8, the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency reported: The spokesperson for the External Relations Committee of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam issued a statement on April 6, strongly condemning the heinous crimes of the U.S. aggressor aircraft recently savagely bombing Xam Neua and Kheang Khay in Laos, as well as bombing the economic and cultural representative offices of Vietnam and China in Laos.

The statement pointed out that no matter how much U.S. imperialism and its lackeys struggle, they cannot shake the firm fighting will of the Laotian people, and the enemy will surely suffer a shameful defeat.

The statement expressed full support for the statement issued by the spokesperson for the High Command of the Laotian People's Liberation Army on March 22, demanding that U.S. imperialism immediately stop bombing Laos and all other acts of aggression.

The statement also pointed out that the bombing by U.S. imperialism and its Laotian lackeys of the economic and cultural representative offices of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the People's Republic of China in Laos is a brutal provocation against the Vietnamese and Chinese peoples. The statement emphasized that the people of South Vietnam and the fraternal Laotian people will fight side by side, resolutely advance to victory, and defeat the U.S. aggressors.
