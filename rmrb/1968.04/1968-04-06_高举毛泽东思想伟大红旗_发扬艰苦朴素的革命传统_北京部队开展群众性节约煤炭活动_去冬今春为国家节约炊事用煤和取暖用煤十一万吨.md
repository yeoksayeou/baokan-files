The Beijing Military Region has launched a mass campaign to save coal, achieving significant results in saving cooking and heating coal last winter and this spring, totaling 110,000 tons.

According to Xinhua News Agency, various levels of leadership in the People's Liberation Army Beijing Military Region have implemented Chairman Mao's latest directive to "further economize and make revolution." They have mobilized cadres, soldiers, workers, and family members to continuously carry out mass coal-saving activities. Last winter and this spring, they saved the country 110,000 tons of cooking and heating coal.

The Beijing Military Region has achieved remarkable results in saving coal over the past few years. After Chairman Mao issued the great call to "further economize and make revolution," various levels of party committees took the class struggle, the struggle between the two lines, and the struggle between the two roads as the key link. They used Chairman Mao's directives on economizing, such as "further economize and make revolution," "prepare for war, prepare for famine, and serve the people," and related discussions on economizing as teaching materials. They held study classes on economizing coal based on Mao Zedong Thought for stove operators, organized lectures, on-site meetings, and exhibitions on applying Mao Zedong Thought to save coal, and sent Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to propagate around stoves and furnaces. They extensively discussed the strategic significance of Chairman Mao's great policies of "building the country through thrift" and "economizing to make revolution," recalled the glorious tradition of hard work and simplicity in our army, and emphasized the importance of coal in the national economy and the significance of saving coal. This fundamentally raised the initiative and awareness of cadres, soldiers, workers, and family members in saving coal. They launched mass coal-saving activities centered on opening up sources, saving on expenditures, and carrying out technological innovations and technological revolutions. Many units extensively used substitute materials. Cadres, soldiers, and boiler operators and managers also followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "making discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress." They fundamentally changed old stoves and rebelled against foreign boilers, opening up new ways to save coal. The quartermaster of a certain unit in Baoding, White Yisheng, along with soldiers, conducted 42 experiments and created a coal-saving, safe, warm, and practical "Red Sky Double Flue Backdraft Furnace," which was quickly adopted by the entire unit.

Various levels of party committees in the Beijing Military Region have taken the lead in implementing Chairman Mao's latest directive to "further economize and make revolution" and have striven to set a good example in saving coal. They designated leading cadres to personally oversee the implementation, listed coal-saving work as an important item on the party committee's agenda, made decisions, and established "Coal-Saving Offices." Various levels of leadership organs also took the lead in reducing stoves and burning substitute materials.

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗　发扬艰苦朴素的革命传统
    北京部队开展群众性节约煤炭活动
    去冬今春为国家节约炊事用煤和取暖用煤十一万吨
    据新华社讯　人民解放军北京部队各级领导机关落实毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的最新指示，发动干部、战士、职工、家属，持续地开展群众性的节煤活动，去冬今春为国家节约炊事用煤和取暖用煤十一万吨。
    北京部队连续几年节约煤炭取得显著成绩。毛主席发出“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大号召后，各级党委以两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争为纲，以毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”、“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大指示和有关节约的论述为教材，分别举办了由烧火人员参加的节约用煤毛泽东思想学习班，召开了活学活用毛泽东思想节煤讲用会、现场会、展览会，并且组织毛泽东思想宣传队深入灶前、炉前巡回宣传，大谈毛主席“勤俭建国”“要节约闹革命”伟大方针的战略意义，大忆我军艰苦朴素的光荣传统，大摆煤炭在国民经济中的重要性和节约煤炭的重要意义，从根本上提高了干部、战士、职工、家属节约用煤的积极性和自觉性，开展了以开源节流，大闹技术革新、技术革命为中心的群众性节煤活动。许多部队广泛利用代用品。广大干部战士和司炉工人、管理人员还遵照毛主席“有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进”的教导，从根本上革旧炉灶的命，造洋锅炉的反，开辟节约煤炭的新路子。保定驻军某部司务长白义生和战士一起，先后进行了四十二次试验，创造出一种节煤、安全、保暖、适用的“满天红双烟道回风火墙炉”，很快被全部队采用。
    北京部队各级党委带头落实毛主席发出的“要进一步节约闹革命”的最新指示，努力做节约煤炭的好样子。他们指定了领导干部亲自负责抓落实，把节煤工作列入党委的重要议事日程，作了决定，成立了“节煤办公室”。各级领导机关还带头减少炉灶，烧代用品。
