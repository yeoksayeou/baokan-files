Title: Exposing the Black Heart Beneath the Facade

The reactionary film *Stormy Waves* uses the pretext of criticizing the wrong line to vigorously promote and glorify the opportunist line. The film's creators fabricated a story about the struggle between Luo Dacheng, Qiu Jin, and the Central Committee's special envoy, attempting to make the audience believe that the incarnations of Peng Dehuai, Luo Dacheng, and Qiu Jin are representatives of the correct line, thereby attempting to rehabilitate the disgraced anti-party element Peng Dehuai.

In reality, if we strip away the facade, we see that the so-called struggle between Luo Dacheng, Qiu Jin, and Wang Huizhi in the film is merely one opportunist line opposing another. They are all of the same ilk.

In the film, the creators meticulously portray Luo Dacheng and Qiu Jin as heroes who consistently advocate for armed struggle. When Luo Dacheng "struggles" with the Central Committee's special envoy, he passionately declares, "I can go to the district party committee, but the workers' and peasants' self-defense corps cannot be disbanded." Look, how "correct" and "resolute" they are!

However, warriors armed with Mao Zedong Thought can see through all deceptions. If we examine the nature of the armed force established by Luo Dacheng and Qiu Jin and the path they follow, we can easily discover: the film, under the guise of advocating armed struggle and opposing Chen Duxiu's right-opportunist line, essentially praises left-adventurism by describing the "great victories" of attacking cities. This fundamentally negates Chairman Mao's consistent advocacy for establishing rural base areas and surrounding the cities from the countryside, a great strategic thought.

Chairman Mao teaches us: the Red Army, apart from fighting battles to destroy the enemy's military forces, must also undertake the major tasks of propagandizing, organizing, arming the masses, helping them establish revolutionary governments, and even building Communist Party organizations. The film shows that Luo Dacheng and Qiu Jin's group neither do political work nor establish Communist Party organizations or revolutionary base areas. After the Kuomintang openly betrayed the cause, they, driven by personal vengeance, indiscriminately killed. After achieving some minor victories, they boastfully claimed, "We have many people and many guns," and immediately attacked heavily fortified enemy positions like Liujiaping and important cities controlled by Kuomintang warlords, displaying sheer adventurism. This is a complete artistic rendition of the left-opportunist line once promoted by the likes of Peng Dehuai.

Stalin said, "'Left' is the shadow of 'right.'" Luo Dacheng and Qiu Jin appear leftist but are fundamentally rightists. In the film, we see that Luo Dacheng and Qiu Jin initially joined forces with the Kuomintang warlord Yan Ziqian, becoming thick as thieves, even fawningly praising this reactionary leader for his supposed concern for the peasants' interests. They harbored great illusions about this butcher, who had the blood of countless laboring people on his hands, hoping he would release the evil landlords from the Kuomintang's headquarters to let the peasants fight. Isn't this hoping for a bandit to have a change of heart? Luo Dacheng and Qiu Jin are by no means representatives of the correct line. They are just like that special envoy, both pinning their hopes on the "wisdom" of the reactionaries, completely lacking class vigilance against the reactionary warlords. As a result, when Yan Ziqian betrayed the cause, it led the revolution to failure, causing countless revolutionaries to meet their deaths. At that time, as leaders of the trade unions and peasant associations, Luo Dacheng and Qiu Jin, along with that special envoy, were all faithful followers of Chen Duxiu's right-opportunist line.

"Fake is fake, and the disguise must be stripped away." The reactionary film *Stormy Waves* goes to great lengths to blur the lines between the two lines, wrapping the opportunist black goods of Peng Dehuai and his ilk in a red shell, passing them off as correct, attempting to rehabilitate Peng Dehuai and the opportunist line. This fully exposes the wolfish ambitions of Peng Dehuai and his propagandists to restore capitalism. We, the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army armed with Mao Zedong Thought, must hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary "storm" aimed at rehabilitating opportunism, and vow to fight and expose the Chinese Khrushchev and his agent Peng Dehuai and his ilk, ensuring they never rise again!

    剥开画皮看黑心
    杨连第生前所在连队政治指导员　朱圣尧
    反动影片《怒潮》打着批判错误路线的幌子，极力宣扬和美化机会主义路线。影片的炮制者，凭空编造了罗大成、邱金和党中央特派员斗争的故事，企图使观众相信彭德怀的化身罗大成、邱金是正确路线的代表，以此来为被罢了官的反党分子彭德怀翻案。
    其实剥开画皮来看，影片中的罗大成、邱金和王怀志的所谓斗争，完全是用错误路线反对错误路线，他们都是一路货色。
    在影片中，炮制者把罗大成和邱金精心装扮成一直坚持武装斗争的英雄。罗大成在同中央特派员作“斗争”时，慷慨激昂地说：“我可以去区党委，工农自卫队不能解散。”看，他们是多么“正确”和“坚定”！
    但是用毛泽东思想武装起来的战士能够识破一切假象。只要看一看罗大成和邱金所建立的这一支武装究竟是什么队伍，他们究竟是沿着哪条路线前进的？我们就不难发现：影片打着进行武装斗争、反对陈独秀右倾机会主义路线的幌子，实质上是通过描写攻打城市的巨大“胜利”，来歌颂“左”倾冒险主义，从根本上否定毛主席一贯主张建立农村根据地，以农村包围城市的伟大战略思想。
    毛主席教导我们：红军“除了打仗消灭敌人军事力量之外，还要负担宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众、帮助群众建立革命政权以至于建立共产党的组织等项重大的任务。”影片表现罗大成、邱金一伙人既不做政治工作，又不建立共产党组织、不建立革命根据地。他们在国民党公开叛变以后，为了个人复仇，乱砍乱杀，在得到了一些小胜利之后，便大肆吹嘘“人多枪多”，马上攻打敌人戒备很严的刘家桥和国民党军阀盘踞的重要城市，表现出十足的盲动主义。这完全是彭德怀之流当年推行“左”倾机会主义路线的艺术翻版。
    斯大林说：“‘左’倾是右倾的影子。”罗大成和邱金形“左”而骨子里仍然是右的。在影片中，我们可以看到罗大成和邱金一开始就同国民党军阀阎紫剑生死与共、情同手足，甚至肉麻地吹捧这个反动头子为了农民的利益能够“大义灭亲”。他们对这个双手沾满了劳动人民鲜血的刽子手抱着莫大的幻想，希望他把恶霸地主从国民党的团部放出来，让农民斗争，这不是要强盗发善心吗？罗大成和邱金决不是什么正确路线的代表。他们同那个中央特派员完全一样，都把希望寄托在反动派的“明智”上，对于反动军阀毫无阶级警惕性，所以后来阎紫剑一叛变，就使革命陷于失败的困境，以致无数革命者人头滚滚落地。当时作为工会和农会领导人的罗大成、邱金，同那个特派员一样，都是十足的陈独秀右倾机会主义路线的信徒。
    “假的就是假的，伪装应当剥去”。反动影片《怒潮》千方百计地混淆两条路线的界限，把彭德怀之流的机会主义黑货裹上了一层红皮，冒充正确的东西，来为彭德怀翻案，为机会主义路线翻案，这也充分地暴露了彭德怀及其吹鼓手们复辟资本主义的狼子野心。我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民解放军战士，一定要更高地举起革命批判的大旗，彻底粉碎为机会主义翻案的反革命“怒潮”，誓把中国赫鲁晓夫和他在军内的代理人彭德怀之流斗倒斗臭，叫他们永世不得翻身！
