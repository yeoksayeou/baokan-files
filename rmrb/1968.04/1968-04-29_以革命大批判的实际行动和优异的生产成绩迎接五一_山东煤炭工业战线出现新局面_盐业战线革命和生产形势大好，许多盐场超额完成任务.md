The revolutionary and production situation on the coal industry front in Shandong Province is excellent. The revolutionary workers across the province, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, are focusing on the revolution and vigorously promoting production. They are determined to welcome the glorious and combative holiday of the working class, "May Day," with concrete actions of deep and sustained revolutionary criticism and excellent production results.

Shandong Province's coal production was consistently the best in the country last year. Entering 1968, the year of seizing a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the coal miners across the province followed the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings of "being modest, prudent, guarding against arrogance and impetuousness." They used the revolution to lead production, persevered, and created a new situation of monthly production increases. By April 25, the province's average daily coal production had increased by 2.02% compared to the fourth quarter of last year. The work in areas such as mining, equipment maintenance, and safety has also been outstanding.

Most coal mines in Shandong Province have established revolutionary committees. Under the leadership of the revolutionary committees, the broad revolutionary workers are actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, focusing on revolutionary criticism, making revolution above ground, and producing below ground. Chairman Mao recently taught us: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a political revolution under the conditions of socialism, led by the Chinese Communist Party and the broad revolutionary masses under its leadership, against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, and is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang reactionaries. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." After studying this great teaching of Chairman Mao, the class struggle and line struggle consciousness of the members of the revolutionary committees and the broad revolutionary workers have been further heightened. The revolutionary committees have led the broad revolutionary workers to launch a more intense attack on the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in this region and unit, and all enemies of the proletarian revolution. In major mining areas such as Zaozhuang, Xinwen, Zibo, and Feicheng, the revolution is booming, and production is thriving. Dozens of coal mines, from the bureau to the mine, to the work area, team, and family, have all set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Everywhere is a battlefield for revolutionary criticism, and everyone is a critic. The broad revolutionary workers, filled with class hatred, launch a fierce attack on the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in this region and unit, determined to thoroughly criticize and expose them politically, ideologically, and theoretically, ensuring they never rise again. In the Feicheng mining area, a new and old cadre participating in the revolutionary committee of a coal mine said: The revolutionary committee has thousands of things to do, but the most fundamental thing is to listen to Chairman Mao's words and focus on class struggle. Under the leadership of the revolutionary committee, the broad revolutionary workers of this mine have exposed a stubborn walking capitalist-roaders and a handful of ghosts and snakes, smashing their evil plot to overthrow the newly born revolutionary committee and sabotage production.

The broad revolutionary workers in various mines, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism," are focusing on transforming their worldview in the Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They combine the class struggle in their mining area and unit with studying Chairman Mao's brilliant judgments, peeling off one layer of Chinese Khrushchev's disguise, and fighting one's selfishness. Through fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism, the broad revolutionary workers have further established the idea of mining for the revolution. They have displayed the high sense of responsibility of the masters of the state, voluntarily abide by socialist labor discipline, and strive in every possible way to tap potential and improve labor efficiency. The broad revolutionary workers in the Zaozhuang mining area, determined to significantly increase coal production for the state, have vowed to "be self-reliant" and strive in every possible way to tap the potential within the enterprise. They have launched a campaign of "repairing and utilizing old equipment," ensuring that every shovel of coal, every degree of electricity, every piece of timber, and every inch of cable is used to its fullest. This not only saved the state a large amount of funds but also ensured stable and high coal production, becoming a banner of self-reliance and thrift in the revolution on the national coal front. Not long ago, the Ministry of Coal Industry held a field meeting here to promote their experience.

Through actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, the broad revolutionary workers on the Shandong coal front have heightened their class struggle and line struggle consciousness. They can not only solve key production problems in a timely manner but also resist the infiltration of various non-proletarian thoughts. In the previous period, the enemies of the proletarian revolution blew a gust of anarchist wind. The workers, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, strongly criticized the reactionary nature of anarchism, ensuring the normal progress of production.

The revolutionary and production situation on the salt industry front in Shandong Province is excellent. Many salt fields have completed tasks such as brine production, embankment repair, and pond filling ahead of schedule and exceeded the quota, creating conditions for the spring salt harvesting. By the end of March, the salt production of the salt fields under the Qingdao Salt Administration had exceeded the production of the same period last year, and the salt production period was advanced by twenty days. The quality of the salt produced is all first-grade.

The excellent revolutionary and production situation on the salt front in Shandong Province is the result of the revolutionary workers on the salt front closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. According to incomplete statistics, the salt fields across the province have held 216 Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with more than 80% of the workers participating. In the Mao Zedong Thought study classes, the revolutionary workers on various salt fields have fiercely criticized the "production-first" and "material incentives" counter-revolutionary revisionist goods promoted by Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the salt system, and firmly established Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In the study classes, they also followed Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly handling cadres, helping cadres who made mistakes to return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line through revolutionary criticism. Currently, 85% of the leading cadres at all levels in the salt system across the province have stood up in revolution, and many of them have participated in the three-in-one leading bodies, playing a key role in leading the revolution and promoting production.

    以革命大批判的实际行动和优异的生产成绩迎接五一
    山东煤炭工业战线出现新局面
    盐业战线革命和生产形势大好，许多盐场超额完成任务
    新华社济南二十八日电　山东煤炭工业战线革命和生产形势一派大好。全省煤炭战线广大革命职工，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在人民解放军的大力帮助下，狠抓革命，猛促生产，决心以深入持久地开展革命大批判的实际行动和优异的生产成绩，来迎接工人阶级光辉战斗的节日——“五一”国际劳动节。
    山东省煤炭生产去年始终是全国完成任务最好的地区。进入夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的一九六八年以后，全省煤矿职工遵循伟大领袖毛主席的“谦虚，谨慎，戒骄，戒躁”的教导，用革命统帅生产，再接再厉，又开创了生产月月上升的新局面。截至四月二十五日止，全省煤炭的平均日产水平比去年第四季度增长了百分之二点零二。开拓掘进、设备维修和安全等方面，也都做得很出色。
    山东省绝大多数煤矿都成立了革命委员会。广大革命职工在革委会领导下活学活用毛泽东思想，狠抓革命大批判，上井闹革命，下井搞生产。毛主席最近教导我们：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”各煤矿革委会成员和广大革命职工学习了毛主席这一伟大教导后，阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟进一步提高。革委会带领广大革命职工向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本地区、本单位的代理人和一切无产阶级革命的敌人，发起了更加猛烈的进攻。在枣庄、新汶、淄博、肥城等几个主要矿区，革命搞得热火朝天，生产蒸蒸日上。数十个煤矿，从局到矿到工区、班组、家庭，都办起了毛泽东思想学习班，处处都是革命大批判的战场，人人都是批判家。广大革命职工满怀阶级仇恨，向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在本地区、本单位的代理人猛烈开火，决心把他们从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批倒、批臭，使他们永世不得翻身。肥城矿区有个煤矿参加革命委员会的新老干部表示：革命委员会有千件事万件事要做，最根本的一件事就是要听毛主席的话，狠抓阶级斗争。这个矿的广大革命职工在革命委员会领导下，揪出了顽固不化的走资派和一小撮牛鬼蛇神，粉碎了他们妄图颠覆新诞生的革命委员会和破坏生产的罪恶阴谋。
    各矿广大革命职工遵照毛主席“要斗私，批修”的教导，在毛泽东思想学习班里，狠抓世界观的改造。他们结合本矿区本单位阶级斗争的实际，学习毛主席一个英明论断，剥一层中国赫鲁晓夫的画皮，斗一次私心。经过斗私批修，广大革命职工进一步树立了为革命采煤的思想，他们发扬国家主人翁的高度责任感，自觉遵守社会主义劳动纪律，千方百计挖掘潜力，提高劳动效率。枣庄矿区的广大革命职工，为大幅度地给国家增产煤炭，立志“自力更生”，千方百计，尽力挖掘企业内部的潜力，大搞“修旧利废”，尽量做到每锨煤、每度电、每根坑木、每寸电缆都能物尽其用，不仅为国家节约了大量资金，还保证了煤炭稳产高产，成为全国煤炭战线自力更生、节约闹革命的一面旗帜。不久前，煤炭工业部在这里召开了现场会，推广了他们的经验。
    山东煤炭战线广大革命职工通过活学活用毛主席著作，提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟。他们不仅能够及时解决生产上的关键问题，而且也能抵制各种非无产阶级思想的侵袭。前一个时期，无产阶级革命的敌人刮起了一股无政府主义的妖风，工人们以毛泽东思想为武器，对无政府主义的反动性进行了有力的批判，保证了生产的正常进行。
    新华社济南二十七日电　山东省盐业战线上革命、生产形势一派大好。许多盐场提前超额完成了制卤、修滩、灌池等任务，为原盐春晒创造了条件。青岛盐务局各盐场到三月底生产的盐已超过去年四月底的产量，产盐期比去年提前二十天，盐的质量全部是优等一级品。
    山东盐业战线革命、生产大好形势的出现，是盐业战线革命职工紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，全面落实毛主席最新指示的结果。据不完全统计，全省各盐场已举办各种毛泽东思想学习班二百一十六期，参加学习的人数占职工总人数的百分之八十以上。各盐场革命职工在毛泽东思想学习班里，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在盐业系统所推行的“生产挂帅”“物质刺激”等反革命修正主义黑货，大立毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。在学习班中，他们还遵循毛主席有关正确地对待干部的教导，通过革命大批判，帮助犯错误的干部重新回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。现在全省盐业系统各级领导干部已有百分之八十五站出来革命，其中许多人还参加了三结合的领导班子，在抓革命促生产中发挥了骨干核心作用。
