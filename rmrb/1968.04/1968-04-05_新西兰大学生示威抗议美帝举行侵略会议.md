About 500 university students in Wellington, the capital of New Zealand, held a demonstration march on the 3rd, angrily denouncing U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam and protesting against the U.S. imperialists' convening of an aggressive meeting in New Zealand with some of its puppet states.

Additionally, U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk, who arrived in Wellington from Washington to participate in a series of aggressive meetings, was greeted by anti-U.S. demonstrators as soon as he stepped off the plane. Demonstrators at Wellington Airport held up signs reading, "Get out of South Vietnam immediately!" expressing their angry protest to Rusk.

    新西兰大学生示威抗议美帝举行侵略会议
    新西兰首都惠灵顿的大学生约五百人三日举行示威游行，愤怒谴责美帝国主义侵略越南，抗议美帝纠集它的一些仆从国家在新西兰举行侵略会议。
    此外，一日从华盛顿赶到惠灵顿来参加一系列侵略会议的美国国务卿腊斯克，刚下飞机就碰到反美示威。示威者在惠灵顿机场上高举着“美国佬马上从南越滚出去！”的标语牌，向腊斯克表示愤怒抗议。　（据新华社）
