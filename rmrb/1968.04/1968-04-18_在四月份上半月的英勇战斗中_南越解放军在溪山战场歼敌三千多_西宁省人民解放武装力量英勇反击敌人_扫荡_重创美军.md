	According to a report from the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, the people's liberation armed forces in the northern region of Quang Tri Province in South Vietnam have continued to fight bravely in the Xishan battlefield from the night of April 13 to the morning of April 15. They have frequently taken the initiative to attack and continuously expanded their victories.

	In these three days, the people's liberation armed forces fought in the hills of 656, 571, and 845 near Xishan, annihilating over 300 enemy soldiers and destroying or damaging 10 enemy aircraft.

	The U.S. aggressors attempted to rescue the U.S. Marine Corps besieged in the Xishan area by mobilizing the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division and the puppet 3rd Airborne Brigade, among other large forces, to invade the Xishan area. However, the enemy's plot was met with a head-on counterattack from the people's liberation armed forces in the northern region of Quang Tri Province from the start. Both the rescuing and besieged enemy forces suffered heavy losses. Whole companies of U.S. aggressor troops were annihilated, and whole battalions were severely damaged. According to incomplete statistics, the people's liberation armed forces have annihilated over 3,000 enemy soldiers in the Xishan battlefield from April 3 to April 15, with the majority being U.S. aggressor troops.

	The Command of the South Vietnamese People's Liberation Armed Forces sent a telegram on April 11 to various units of the liberation army in the Xishan battlefield, praising them for overcoming all difficulties and achieving continuous great victories. The Command also called on them to continue to fiercely attack the enemy and achieve even more glorious victories.

	According to a report from the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, the people's liberation armed forces in Xining Province bravely counterattacked the enemy's large-scale "sweeping" operations and achieved a victory in the first battle on April 12, annihilating over 400 U.S. aggressor troops.

	The report said that on April 10, a reinforced regiment of the U.S. 25th Infantry Division invaded the area along the Saigon River, about 80 kilometers northwest of Saigon. The people's liberation armed forces decided to smash the enemy's "sweeping" operations and launched a surprise attack at dawn on April 12 against the regiment's camp located north of the oil well county town on the west bank of the Saigon River.

	According to preliminary information, the assault troops of the liberation armed forces fiercely charged and fought, occupying the enemy's command post, communication area, and mortar positions after more than an hour of battle. They annihilated over 400 U.S. troops, seizing a large amount of weapons, ammunition, and military supplies.

	In an attempt to escape the increasingly passive and desperate situation since the New Year and to save the Saigon situation, the U.S. aggressors recently gathered a large number of troops to launch a large-scale "sweeping" operation codenamed "Operation Victory" in various provinces around Saigon. However, the U.S. aggressors' criminal actions have met with heavy failures from the start.

    在四月份上半月的英勇战斗中
    南越解放军在溪山战场歼敌三千多
    西宁省人民解放武装力量英勇反击敌人“扫荡”重创美军
    新华社河内十七日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方广治省北部地区人民解放武装力量，发扬连续进攻、连续夺取胜利的精神，在四月十三日深夜到十五日上午，继续在溪山战场英勇战斗，频频主动出击，不断扩大战果。
    在这三天里，人民解放武装力量转战在溪山附近的六五六、五七一、八四五等高地，又歼灭美伪军三百多名，击毁击伤敌机十架。
    美国侵略者妄图为被围困在溪山地区的美国海军陆战队解围，最近调动美国第一骑兵师和伪军第三伞兵战团等大批兵力，向溪山地区进犯。但是，敌人的阴谋从一开始就遭到广治省北部地区人民解放武装的迎头痛击，前往救援的和被围困的敌人都遭到了沉重的打击，美国侵略军整连整连地被全歼，整营整营地被重创。据不完全统计，人民解放武装力量从四月三日到十五日，在溪山战场已消灭敌人三千多名，其中大部分是美国侵略军。
    越南南方人民解放武装力量指挥部，十一日打电报给溪山战场的各个解放军单位，热烈表彰他们克服一切困难，接连取得的巨大胜利，并号召他们继续狠狠地打击敌人，建立更加辉煌的战功。
    新华社河内十七日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方西宁省人民解放武装力量英勇反击敌人发动的大规模“扫荡”，十二日首战告捷，一仗消灭美国侵略军四百多名。
    报道说，四月十日，美国第二十五步兵师的一个加强旅向西贡市西北面约八十公里的西贡河沿岸地区进犯。人民解放武装力量决心粉碎敌人的这次“扫荡”，在十二日凌晨，向驻扎在西贡河西岸油汀县城北面地区的这个旅的一个营的驻地，发动突然袭击。
    据初步消息，解放武装力量的突击队员们猛冲猛打，经过一个多小时的战斗便占领了敌军指挥部、通讯联络区和迫击炮阵地，消灭美军四百多名，缴获大批武器、弹药和军用物资。
    美国侵略者为了摆脱新春以来更加深陷的被动狼狈困境和妄图解救西贡的危局，最近拼凑了大批兵力在西贡周围各省发动代号“全胜行动”的大规模“扫荡”。但美国侵略者的这次罪恶行动从一开始就遭到惨重的失败。
