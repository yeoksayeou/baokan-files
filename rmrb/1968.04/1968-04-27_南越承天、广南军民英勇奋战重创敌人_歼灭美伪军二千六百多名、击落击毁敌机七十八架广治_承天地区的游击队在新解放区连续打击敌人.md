The people's armed forces and civilians of Quang Tri and Quang Nam provinces in South Vietnam have recently launched successive attacks against American and puppet forces, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy.

From March 13 to April 23, the people of various ethnic groups in the western region of Quang Tri Province fought bravely on the 12th Highway, foiling the enemy's attempt to reoccupy the highway and achieving the glorious result of annihilating nearly 1,000 enemy troops.

The people's armed forces not only fiercely intercepted enemy troops who had been parachuted to the ground but also bravely confronted air pirates, shooting down 53 enemy aircraft. On March 29, a guerrilla squad bravely retaliated against the attack of dozens of enemy aircraft, shooting down four helicopters and one jet fighter. On April 19, the people of the 12th Highway region coordinated closely with the people of the 9th Highway region to deliver a heavy blow to the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division, shooting down 34 American helicopters in one go and annihilating nearly 300 American invaders.

From March 30 to April 18, the people's armed forces of Quang Nam Province frequently launched attacks in the areas around Da Nang, Hoi An, and Tam Ky, fiercely assaulting American invaders and South Korean mercenaries, causing the enemy to suffer heavy losses.

According to statistics, during this period, the people of Quang Nam Province killed and wounded 1,655 enemy troops, including 790 American invaders and 145 South Korean mercenaries; destroyed 86 various military vehicles, shot down and destroyed 25 enemy aircraft, destroyed nearly 20 cannons and mortars, blew up 20 forts and 7 bridges, and burned down one fuel depot, one ammunition depot, and one military supply warehouse.

The people's armed forces and civilians of the Quang Tri-Quang Nam region have continuously attacked the enemy, engaging in hundreds of large and small battles over 20 days from March 15 to April 5, annihilating nearly 2,500 enemy troops, most of whom were American invaders.

Guerrilla forces in various places laid a trap, and wherever the enemy went, they were subjected to fierce attacks by the guerrillas. Guerrilla warfare in various newly liberated areas also flourished, making it difficult for the enemy to move.

The guerrilla forces of Quang Tri Province, with deep hatred for the enemy and a firm determination to defend the people's lives and property, smashed the enemy's "sweeping" operations around Hue City and transportation lines, making the liberated areas more solid. The self-defense forces of Hue City also cleverly thwarted the enemy's searches and punished dozens of thugs.

The guerrilla forces of Quang Tri Province's Quang Dien County, Phu Loc County, Hoa Vang County, and Quang Tri Province's Hai Lang County, and Chau Thuan County continuously intercepted the enemy's "sweeping" operations and attempted to open transportation lines, and surrounded the enemy's various bases, strongholds, and outposts, annihilating more than 1,000 enemy troops.

The movement of shooting down American planes with rifles flourished in various guerrilla forces. The guerrilla forces of the Quang Tri-Quang Nam region shot down 30 various types of American bandit aircraft in these 20 days, killing and capturing many air pirates.
