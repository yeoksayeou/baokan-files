People in various parts of Zambia have recently held mass rallies and demonstrations to condemn the aggression of South Rhodesia, South Africa, and Portugal, which, with the support of American and British imperialism, have colluded militarily to encircle Zambia, repeatedly launching armed invasions, and plotting to overthrow the government of this young republic and suppress the armed struggle of the people in southern Africa.

At rallies across the country, speakers unanimously called for the unity of the Zambian people to defend their homeland and urged the people of Zimbabwe to fight alongside Zimbabwean guerrillas for the liberation of their country.

The large-scale condemnation activities were held on March 21 to mark the eighth anniversary of the Sharpeville Massacre in South Africa. On this day, from Livingstone on the southern border of Zambia to Ndola along the railway line to the northern border, several cities held mass rallies and demonstrations. People held up large banners condemning the apartheid and racial oppression policies of the white racist regimes in South Rhodesia and South Africa, and shouted slogans such as "Hang Smith!" and "Hang Vorster!"

In the Zambian capital Lusaka, the marchers also demonstrated in front of the British High Commissioner's Office. In Ndola, the northern copper mining center, the excited marchers smashed the windows of a local British library.

On March 20 and 21, Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda spoke on national television and at a mass rally in the capital, condemning the imperialist countries' support for the reactionary regimes in South Rhodesia and South Africa. He pointed out that since South Rhodesia's unilateral declaration of "independence," Zambia has faced difficulties, but this will not hinder Zambia's progress. He also stated that Zambia will provide weapons to African freedom fighters who are determined to fight.

On April 7, mass demonstrations were held in Lusaka, Kitwe, and four other towns to protest against the recent brutal persecution of African Americans by the U.S. government.

    赞比亚各地人民纷纷举行集会示威
    愤怒声讨南非、南罗和葡萄牙的侵略罪行
    据新华社十四日讯 卢萨卡消息：赞比亚各地人民最近纷纷举行群众集会和游行示威，愤怒声讨南罗得西亚、南非和葡萄牙殖民政权在美英帝国主义的支持下，在军事上勾结起来包围赞比亚，一再向赞比亚发动武装侵略，阴谋颠覆这个年青的共和国政权，镇压非洲南部人民的武装斗争。
    在各地集会上，人们在讲话中一致要求赞比亚人民团结起来为保卫祖国而战斗，并呼吁津巴布韦人民为解放他们的国家而同津巴布韦游击战士战斗在一起。
    声势浩大的声讨活动是在三月二十一日纪念南非沙佩维尔大屠杀惨案八周年时进行的。这一天，从赞比亚南部边境的利文斯敦一直到北部边境的恩多拉铁路沿线一带的几个城市，都举行了群众集会和游行示威。人们高举着谴责南罗得西亚和南非白人种族主义当局推行的种族隔离和种族压迫政策的大标语，并且愤怒高呼“枪毙史密斯！”“吊死沃斯特！”等口号。
    在赞比亚首都卢萨卡，参加游行的群众还曾到英国高级专员公署门前示威。在北部铜矿中心恩多拉，情绪激昂的游行群众砸了当地一家英国图书馆的窗户。
    三月二十日和二十一日，赞比亚总统卡翁达曾分别在首都电视台和群众集会上讲话，谴责帝国主义国家支持南罗得西亚和南非反动当局。他指出，自从南罗得西亚片面宣布“独立”以来，赞比亚遭到了困难，但这绝阻挠不了赞比亚的前进。他还表示，赞比亚将向下定决心的非洲自由战士提供武器。
    四月七日，在卢萨卡、基特韦等五个城镇，又举行了群众性的示威活动，抗议美国政府最近对美国黑人的残酷迫害。
