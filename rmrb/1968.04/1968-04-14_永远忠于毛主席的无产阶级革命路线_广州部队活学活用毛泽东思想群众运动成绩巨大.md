Arming workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and cadres with Mao Zedong Thought, and further promoting the ideological transformation of people, is the most reliable and fundamental guarantee to prevent revisionism, prevent the restoration of capitalism, and ensure the victory of our socialist and communist cause. The method of studying Mao Zedong's works with questions in mind, actively applying and integrating learning with practice, learning first what is urgently needed, and focusing on practical application, has proven effective and universally applicable. It should be further promoted throughout the Party and the country.

	Excerpted from the "Communique of the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China"

	"We should be modest, prudent, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, and wholeheartedly serve the Chinese people." The entire army's active learner of Chairman Mao's works, Comrade Huang Zushi, always remembers Chairman Mao's teachings and strictly demands of himself. He actively learns and applies Chairman Mao's latest instructions, continually breaks private interests and establishes public interests, and has achieved new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The picture shows Comrade Huang Zushi (third from the right) discussing his experiences in actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works with his comrades.

	The advanced collective in studying Chairman Mao's works in the Guangzhou Military Region, the certain unit's permanent line maintenance company, actively helps the local poor and lower-middle peasants establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes, actively learns and applies Chairman Mao's works, and effectively promotes the ideological transformation of the community members, completing the spring plowing work ahead of schedule. This picture shows the company's comrades in a Mao Zedong Thought study class in the fields, fighting private interests and criticizing revisionism with the community members.

	Comrade Huang Yuying, a militia member of the Jiyang County Guiling Commune and deputy director of the Guangdong Revolutionary Committee, has an unlimited love for the great leader Chairman Mao and intense hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev. As early as 1966, she posted a big-character poster criticizing the black "Cultivation of Morality." In the face of the bourgeois reactionary line, she remained unshakable and fought resolutely, finally achieving victory with the decisive support of the leftist troops. The picture shows Comrade Huang Yuying (second from the right) exchanging experiences in actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works with the female militia members.

	The advanced collective in studying Chairman Mao's works in the Guangzhou Military Region, the 189th Hospital, resolutely implements Chairman Mao's important instructions on medical work and wholeheartedly serves the people. They often go deep into the countryside, propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions, humbly learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants, and enthusiastically treat diseases for them. This picture shows them, with deep proletarian feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao, presenting Chairman Mao's portrait to the poor and lower-middle peasants.

	Comrade Ma Yi, a model in studying Chairman Mao's works in the Guangzhou Military Region, criticizes the "philosophy of survival" of the Chinese Khrushchev with practical actions. She is filled with unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, ignores her illness, and persistently studies, propagates, executes, and defends Mao Zedong Thought. She goes deep into the countryside and learns Mao Zedong's brilliant works with the broad poor and lower-middle peasants, promoting revolution and production together.

	The advanced collective in studying Chairman Mao's works in the Guangzhou Military Region, the certain unit's first battalion machine gun company, enthusiastically propagates and resolutely implements Chairman Mao's latest instructions, arming the proletarian revolutionary masses with Mao Zedong Thought. This picture shows Comrade Chen Changjian, the squad leader (second from the right), enthusiastically propagating Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the revolutionary masses and discussing the great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution with them.
