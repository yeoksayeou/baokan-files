Revolutionary committees in many factories and mines in Huangshi region, Hubei Province, have been vigorously promoting class struggle and line struggle education. They are resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." The revolutionary and production situations in these factories and mines are excellent and continue to improve. Since the beginning of this year, the daily production levels of major industrial products such as steel, steel products, coal, cement, cotton yarn, and rubber products have all significantly increased compared to the fourth quarter of last year, with some products seeing a substantial rise in output.

Huangshi City is a newly developed industrial city in Hubei Province. The broad revolutionary workers here, with unwavering loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, have followed his great strategic deployment and achieved revolutionary great unity early on, establishing temporary power organs at various levels that combine revolution, military, and administrative forces. After the establishment of revolutionary committees in many factories and mines, they immediately organized the masses to set up various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Inside and outside these classes, they have been deeply engaged in revolutionary criticism, launching continuous attacks on the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, such as China's Khrushchev, and their agents. This has further heightened the masses' awareness of class struggle and line struggle. Many factories and mines have universally carried out the "three remembrances and three comparisons" activities, stirring up the proletarian sentiments of revolutionary workers. They harbor deep hatred towards class enemies and throw themselves into revolutionary criticism, fiercely exposing and criticizing China's Khrushchev and his agents for their counter-revolutionary revisionist line of managing enterprises and their heinous crimes of attempting to restore capitalism. They have been cleansing their influence from all angles. The deeper the revolutionary criticism goes, the redder the hearts of the revolutionary masses become, the brighter their eyes shine, the firmer their resolve to fight against class enemies, and the greater their determination to carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Many revolutionary committees in factories and mines have also paid attention to guiding the broad masses of revolutionary cadres and workers to correctly handle the relationship between revolution and production during the revolutionary criticism. This has enabled the broad revolutionary workers to establish the correct view that revolution should lead production. Therefore, many workers in factories and mines have voluntarily risen up to criticize, resist, and eradicate the influence of the anarchist and counter-revolutionary economism poison spread by class enemies. They say that the attitude towards Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production" is a matter of loyalty or disloyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, and a matter of whether one follows or does not follow the great strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao. Some young workers at the Daye Iron Mine, after listening to old workers recounting their bitter family histories and the happiness they gained under Chairman Mao's leadership, were deeply moved and said: Not understanding exploitation means not understanding revolution. Not knowing the sufferings of the working class in the old society means not appreciating today's happiness and not being able to deeply understand the noble duties of the working class and the great task of carrying the revolution through to the end. Their proletarian consciousness has been heightened, their sense of revolutionary responsibility has been strengthened, and everyone appears on the production front with a fighting posture, striving to be models of grasping revolution and promoting production. Many revolutionary cadres and old workers in factories and mines, on the one hand, set an example by maintaining proletarian revolutionary discipline, and on the other hand, actively engage in ideological struggle against those who disrupt revolutionary discipline. They patiently help some comrades raise their awareness of class struggle and line struggle, and resolutely expose the evil plots of class enemies to disrupt revolution and production, pushing the revolution and production forward continuously.

The revolutionary committees in various factories and mines in Huangshi region have vigorously promoted class struggle and line struggle education, greatly inspiring the broad revolutionary masses with sky-high enthusiasm. The broad revolutionary masses have carried forward the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle and self-reliance, vigorously promoting technological innovation, and continuously developing production. Workers in factories and mines such as Hubei Steel Plant, Daye Iron Mine, and Dongfeng Cement Plant, remembering Chairman Mao's great call to "further economize and make revolution," have relied on self-reliance to add many basic construction and production facilities without spending money or spending less money. Workers in the shale car of Dongfeng Cement Plant, after a month of hard work, made a sand crusher from discarded materials, saving the state tens of thousands of yuan.

    黄石地区各厂矿企业革委会狠抓阶级斗争和路线斗争教育
    革命群众心红眼亮对阶级敌人打进攻战
    广大职工干劲冲天生产形势越来越好
    据新华社武汉十七日电　湖北黄石地区许多厂矿企业的革命委员会，狠抓阶级斗争和路线斗争教育，坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，厂矿的革命、生产形势一片大好，越来越好，今年以来钢、钢材、煤炭、水泥、棉纱、橡胶制品等主要工业产品的日产水平都比去年第四季度显著提高，其中有些产品的产量大幅度上升。
    黄石市是湖北省新兴的工业城市。这里的广大革命职工，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席的无限忠诚，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，较早地实现了革命大联合，建立了各级革命三结合的临时权力机构。许多厂矿企业革命委员会成立后，立即发动群众大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，在班内班外深入开展革命大批判，向中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派及其代理人不停地发动进攻，进一步提高了革命群众的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟。许多工矿企业的学习班，普遍地开展“三忆三比”活动，激发革命职工的无产阶级感情，使他们怀着对阶级敌人的深仇大恨，投入到革命大批判中去，狠揭猛批中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人推行反革命修正主义办企业路线和复辟资本主义的滔天罪行，并从各个方面涤荡其流毒。革命大批判越深入，革命群众的心越红，眼越亮，向阶级敌人斗争的意志越坚，执行毛主席最新指示的决心越大。
    许多厂矿企业单位的革命委员会，还注意在革命大批判中引导广大无产阶级革命派和革命职工正确处理革命和生产的关系，使广大革命职工树立起革命统帅生产的正确观点。因此，许多工矿企业的革命职工，纷纷起来自觉地批判、抵制和肃清阶级敌人煽起的无政府主义反动思潮和反革命经济主义妖风的影响。他们说，对毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针抱什么态度，是忠不忠于伟大领袖毛主席的问题，是紧跟不紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的伟大战略部署的问题。大冶铁矿的一些青年工人听了老工人忆血泪家史，摆在毛主席领导下得到翻身解放的幸福以后，深受感动地说：不懂得剥削，就不懂得革命，不了解工人阶级在旧社会的苦，就不晓得今天的幸福，就不能深刻理解工人阶级的崇高职责和把革命进行到底的伟大任务。他们的无产阶级觉悟提高了，革命责任感加强了，人人以战斗的姿态出现在生产岗位上，争做抓革命、促生产的模范。许多工矿企业的无产阶级革命派和革命老工人，一方面以身作则，带头维护无产阶级的革命纪律，一方面对于那些破坏革命纪律的行为展开积极的思想斗争。他们耐心地帮助一些同志提高阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，并坚决地揭露阶级敌人破坏革命和生产的罪恶阴谋，推动革命、生产不断前进。
    黄石地区各厂矿企业革命委员会大抓阶级斗争，大抓阶级斗争和路线斗争教育，极大地焕发起广大革命群众的冲天干劲。广大革命群众发扬艰苦奋斗、自力更生的革命精神，大搞技术革新，使生产不断发展。湖北钢厂、大冶铁矿、东风水泥厂等厂矿的职工，牢记毛主席“要进一步节约闹革命”的伟大号召，依靠自力更生，不花钱或少花钱，增添了许多基本建设和生产设备。东风水泥厂砂页岩车间的工人，苦战一个多月，用废旧物资制成了一部碎砂机，为国家节省了几万元资金。
