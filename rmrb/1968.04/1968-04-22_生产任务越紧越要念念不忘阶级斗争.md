Last spring, our commune established a revolutionary committee, and I was elected as a deputy director. After the revolutionary committee was established, what should we focus on? We did not solve this problem right away; instead, we took a detour.

After the revolutionary committee was established, I thought that now the big task was accomplished, and I could relax a bit. The string of class struggle in my mind began to loosen. At this time, the capitalist roaders within the party and the ghosts and snakes in society took the opportunity to sneak in. They secretly spread fallacies saying, "We have been engaged in revolution for more than a year, and now we have established a revolutionary committee; we should focus on production." This wind blew into the revolutionary committee and coincided with our "relaxing" mentality, mistakenly thinking it was the "people's" demand. At a full meeting of the revolutionary committee, some comrades said, "The capitalist roaders have been exposed, and the poison of the reactionary bourgeois line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev has been criticized to a great extent; we should concentrate on production." Others said, "Currently, it is the busy spring plowing season; everything else can be set aside; the season does not wait for people, and if production is not done well, it will be a mistake." Thus, everyone divided tasks and went down to focus on production.

The problems in Xuejia Brigade were more complicated, so a standing committee member was sent there with a few comrades. They arrived at the first production team and heard that someone was inciting a split, affecting the work of the commune members. Should we first solve the problem of the split? Or should we first focus on production? Some people thought: The poor and lower-middle peasants all disagree with the split, and only a few people are causing trouble. As long as we start with production, the problem of the split can be solved. However, during the evening mass meeting to mobilize production, problems arose. A few people questioned the comrades sent there, asking if they were there to focus on production or to solve the problem of the split. They also said that if the problem of the split was not solved, they would not engage in production. At this time, some comrades advocated firmly exposing the class enemy's sabotage of production and mobilizing the poor and lower-middle peasants to fight against them. Others were concerned that if the matter was made public, it would affect production. They returned to the commune with this problem. After hearing their report, I thought: Why, shortly after the revolutionary committee was established, did some brigades start clamoring for a split? Why did some of our cadres also agree to focus on production without focusing on class struggle? At this time, I studied Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said, "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not readily accept their defeat; they will make their last struggle." "Class struggle is an objective existence, not dependent on the will of man. That is, it is inevitable. Man's will wants to avoid it, but it is impossible. One can only follow the trend and seize victory." The more I thought about it, the more I felt that there was a problem with the thoughts of our leading cadres. For example, before the revolutionary committee was established, I was the leader of the commune's production leadership team. At that time, most cadres did not come forward, and big and small matters were all brought to me. I was constantly thinking about problems and had a strong sense of responsibility. After the revolutionary committee was established, I was the second-in-command, thinking that I should retreat to the "second line" and "rest a bit." This "rest" was a reflection of my weakening class struggle consciousness. The "rest" thought of the individual, forgetting the state's affairs and class struggle. Having the thought of "resting a bit" would inevitably lead to retreat. Retreat means what? Retreat means escaping the fiery class struggle, retreat means deviating from Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and retreat means handing over the "power" we have seized to the enemy. Reviewing Chairman Mao's teachings made my thoughts clear: The establishment of the revolutionary committee is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The enemy must harbor deep hatred for our victory. The closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to complete victory, the more the class enemy will make desperate struggles. The establishment of the revolutionary committee is not the end of class struggle but a new starting point. The defeated enemy, "they are always studying strategies to deal with us, 'observing the direction,' seeking to succeed." The enemy's desperate counterattack is not to be feared; what is to be feared is our loss of class vigilance. At this time, I realized that whether or not we emphasize proletarian politics and whether or not we focus on class struggle is a top priority for the revolutionary committee to hold and use power for the proletariat.

After my awareness was raised, I suggested that the revolutionary committee hold a standing committee meeting to discuss the direction of the revolutionary committee's work. We all studied Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forgetting class struggle." With "what should the revolutionary committee focus on after its establishment?" as the topic, we had a discussion. Everyone linked the class struggle, the two lines, and the two roads before and after the establishment of the revolutionary committee nationwide and in our region. We further studied Chairman Mao's theory, line, principles, methods, and policies on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Through study, we strengthened our class struggle consciousness and clarified the direction of the revolutionary committee's work: never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, never forget to emphasize proletarian politics, and never forget to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. These four "never forgets" are the criteria for all the work of the revolutionary committee. Then, everyone linked the actual situation and discussed how to handle the problem of Xuejia Brigade. Everyone unanimously agreed that the split was, in the new situation, the class enemy using anarchist trends to counterattack the newly born revolutionary committee, attempting to seize the leadership of our revolutionary committee to adhere to the socialist road. How to handle this problem is a severe test of what flag our commune revolutionary committee will raise and what road it will take. We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely take the socialist road, and severely strike down the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line. The comrades who went to Xuejia Brigade, after studying, raised their class struggle consciousness, and the original team returned to the first production team with full confidence. They fully relied on the masses, mobilized the masses, and drove back the class enemy's evil wind of splitting. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres worked together, making the revolution and production flourish. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants reflected, "'Three-in-one' power is good, it severely struck down the class enemy's new counterattack, blocked the dead-end of spontaneous capitalist forces. The newly born revolutionary committee truly represents the interests of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, we are a thousand times at ease!"

    生产任务越紧越要念念不忘阶级斗争
    辽宁省海城县耿庄人民公社革命委员会副主任、公社武装部长　
    蔡庆文
    去年春天，我们公社成立了革命委员会，我被选为革命委员会的副主任委员。革命委员会成立后应该着重抓什么？我们并不是一下子就解决了的，而是走了一段弯路的。
    革命委员会成立以后，我认为这下子大功告成，可以松口气了。我头脑里阶级斗争这根弦，就开始松了下来。就在这时，党内走资派和社会上的牛鬼蛇神，乘机钻空子，他们在暗地里散布谬论说：“抓革命抓了一年多，现在已经建立了革命委员会，应该抓生产了。”这股风吹到了革命委员会，和我们“松口气”的思想对上了号，误以为这是“群众”的要求。在一次革命委员会全体会议上，有的同志说：“走资派已经揪出来了，中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的资产阶级反动路线的流毒，也批判得差不多了，应该集中精力抓好生产。”还有的说：“目前正是春耕大忙季节，别的都可以不管；季节不等人，生产抓不好就要犯错误。”于是大家就分工深入下去抓生产去了。
    薛家大队的问题比较多，就派一个常委带几个同志去那里。他们到了第一生产队，就听说有人煽动闹分队，影响社员干活。是先解决闹分队的问题？还是先把生产抓上去呢？有的人认为：贫下中农都不同意分队，闹分队的只是几个人，只要从抓生产入手，闹分队的问题就可以解决。谁知在晚上召开群众会动员抓生产时，却出了问题。有个别的人质问派去的同志是来抓生产的，还是来解决分队问题的？还说什么不解决分队问题就不搞生产。这时有的同志主张坚决揭露阶级敌人破坏生产的阴谋，发动贫下中农跟他们作斗争。也有的担心事闹大了，会影响生产。他们带着这个问题回到了公社。我听了他们介绍的情况，心里寻思：为什么革命委员会刚成立不久，有的大队就吵吵要分队？为什么在我们干部中也有人同意抓生产不抓阶级斗争呢？这时我学习了毛主席著作，毛主席说：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”“阶级斗争是客观存在，不依人的意志为转移的。就是说，不可避免的。人的意志想要避免，也不可能。只能因势利导，夺取胜利。”我越想越觉得我们领导干部的思想里有问题。拿我来说吧，在没成立革命委员会以前，我是公社生产领导班子组长，那时多数干部没站出来，大事小事都找我，我成天开动脑筋想问题，责任心也较强。成立了革命委员会，我是第二把手，心想该退到“第二线”了，该“歇歇气”了。这个“歇”字就是阶级斗争观念开始淡薄的反映。“歇”字想的是个人，忘记了国家大事、阶级斗争大事。有“歇歇气”的思想，必然产生退的行动。退，意味着什么呢？退，就是逃避火热的阶级斗争，退，就意味着要离开毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，把已夺来的“权”送给敌人。重温毛主席的教导，使我的思想豁然开朗：革命委员会的成立，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。敌人对我们的胜利必然是刻骨仇恨。无产阶级文化大革命越接近全面胜利，阶级敌人越要进行垂死挣扎。革命委员会的成立，不是结束了阶级斗争，而是阶级斗争新的起点。被打倒的敌人，“他们老是在研究对付我们的策略，‘窥测方向’，以求一逞。”敌人的疯狂反扑，并不可怕，可怕的是我们丧失阶级警惕性。这时，我认识到，突出不突出无产阶级政治，抓不抓阶级斗争，是关系着革命委员会能不能为无产阶级掌好权、用好权的头等大事。
    认识提高了，我就建议革命委员会召开常委会，讨论革命委员会的工作方向问题。我们大家学习了毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，以“革命委员会成立之后，应该着重抓什么”为专题，展开讨论。大家联系革命委员会成立前后，全国和本地区两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的实际，进一步学习了毛主席关于无产阶级专政下，继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策。通过学习增强了阶级斗争观念，明确了革命委员会的工作方向是：念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出无产阶级政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。这四个念念不忘，就是革命委员会一切工作的准则。接着大家又联系实际，研究如何处理薛家大队的问题。大家一致认为，闹分队，就是在新形势下，阶级敌人利用无政府主义思潮向新生的革命委员会的反扑，是妄图争夺我们革命委员会坚持社会主义道路的领导权。以什么态度处理这个问题，是对我们公社革命委员会打什么旗，走什么道路的严峻考验。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决走社会主义道路，狠狠打击资产阶级反动路线的新反扑。去薛家大队的几个同志，学习后提高了阶级斗争观念，原班人马满怀信心回到第一生产队，充分依靠群众，发动群众，把阶级敌人闹分队的妖风击退了。广大贫下中农和革命干部齐心协力，革命、生产搞得热火朝天。广大贫下中农反映说：“‘三结合’掌权就是好，狠狠地打击了阶级敌人的新反扑，堵死了资本主义自发势力的死胡同。新生的革命委员会真正代表了广大贫下中农的利益，咱们一千个放心！”
