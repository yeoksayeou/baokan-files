The U.S. imperialists, mired in the quagmire of their aggression against Vietnam and unable to extricate themselves, have brazenly dispatched a KC-135 aerial refueling squadron to a military airbase in central Taiwan. This further turns our territory of Taiwan into a military base for their escalation of the war in Vietnam and a springboard for attacking our mainland.

According to a revelation by a U.S. military official in Taiwan, Castriken, on March 25 in Taipei, the U.S. Air Force had dispatched fifteen KC-135 aerial refueling aircraft, along with U.S. Air Force personnel, to the Taichung base a month earlier. He also admitted that the U.S. aerial refueling aircraft's entry into Taiwan is "interconnected" with a series of criminal activities by U.S. imperialism in its military adventures in the Far East. According to reports from Western news agencies, the U.S. imperialists' aerial refueling squadron's entry into Taiwan is to refuel B-52 bombers flying from Guam and Okinawa to massacre the Vietnamese people. The intrusion of U.S. aerial refueling aircraft has aroused the extreme anger of the broad masses of Taiwanese compatriots.

In order to adapt to the needs of escalating the aggression against Vietnam, the U.S. imperialists, in collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, have been continuously expanding military ports in Kaohsiung, Keelung, and Hualien, expanding and building new military airfields, and establishing military factories and armament repair shops. At the same time, U.S. military and political leaders have frequently visited Taiwan for conspiratorial activities. According to reports from the Chiang Kai-shek clique's newspapers, from March 15 to 18 this year, the commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, Bringle, aboard the fleet's flagship "Divine Providence," intruded into Keelung Harbor for three days of conspiratorial activities.

The U.S. imperialists' occupation of our territory of Taiwan not only ferociously carries out political, economic, and cultural aggression against Taiwan, enslaving and exploiting the Taiwanese people, and turning Taiwan into their colony, but also intensifies military aggression against Taiwan, openly using Taiwan as a military base for their escalation of the aggression against Vietnam and a springboard for attacking our mainland. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people, the Vietnamese people, and the people of Asia. The U.S. imperialists will surely receive their due punishment. The U.S. imperialists' faithful running dogs, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, will end up being sacrificed for their master's aggression against Vietnam.

    进一步把我国领土台湾作为侵越基地和进攻我国大陆的跳板
    美帝悍然派遣空中加油机中队进驻台湾
    新华社一日讯　深陷在侵略越南战争泥潭之中无法自拔的美帝国主义，悍然派遣KC—135型空中加油机中队进驻台湾中部空军基地，进一步把我国领土台湾作为它扩大侵越战争的军事基地和进攻我国大陆的跳板。
    据侵台美军总部人员卡斯特里肯三月二十五日在台北供认，美国空军当局已经在一个月以前把十五架KC—135型空中加油机连同美国空军人员派进台中基地。他还供认，美国空中加油机的进驻台湾，是和美帝国主义在远东扩大军事冒险的一系列罪恶活动“相互连系的”。另据西方通讯社的消息透露，美帝国主义的空中加油机中队进驻台湾，是为了给从关岛、冲绳起飞屠杀越南人民的B—52型轰炸机空中加油。美帝国主义空中加油机的入侵，激起了广大台湾同胞的极大愤怒。
    美帝国主义为了适应扩大侵略越南战争的需要，勾结蒋介石卖国集团，不断扩建高雄、基隆、花莲等军事港口，扩建和新建军用机场，开设军用工厂和军械修配厂。与此同时，美国军政头目还频繁地到台湾进行阴谋活动。据蒋帮报纸报道，今年三月十五日到十八日，美国第七舰队司令布林格尔乘舰队旗舰“神明”号闯入基隆港进行了三天的阴谋活动。
    美帝国主义霸占我国领土台湾，不仅疯狂地对台湾进行政治、经济、文化侵略，奴役和剥削台湾人民，把台湾变成它的殖民地，而且加紧对台湾进行军事侵略，公然把台湾作为它扩大侵略越南战争的军事基地和进攻我国大陆的跳板，这是中国人民、越南人民和亚洲人民绝对不能容忍的。美帝国主义必将受到应有的惩罚。美帝国主义的忠实走狗蒋介石卖国集团，死心塌地充当美帝国主义侵略越南战争的帮凶，到头来只能为它的主子殉葬。
