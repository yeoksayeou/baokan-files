The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Taoyuan Production Brigade in Luning County, Hebei Province, following Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle," have been steadfastly carrying out revolutionary criticism and struggle, thoroughly purging the poison of China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionism. They have held over 1,300 meetings to criticize China's Khrushchev, greatly raising their class consciousness and awareness of line struggle. With the arrival of the spring plowing season, this brigade has combined spring plowing production with a thorough criticism of China's Khrushchev and his wife Wang XX's spreading of counter-revolutionary economism. The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres have firmly declared that they will definitely follow Chairman Mao's words, learn from the people of Dazhai, and follow the Dazhai path, carrying forward the spirit of self-reliance, hard work, and farming for revolution. They will further develop the socialist collective economy. Below is a record of a recent field criticism meeting held by the members of the Fourth Production Team of Taoyuan Brigade during the first line of spring plowing production.

That afternoon, more than forty members and cadres of the Fourth Production Team, during their break from leveling the land, gathered in front of Chairman Mao's portrait. Comrade Wu Chen, the former Party branch secretary of the brigade who was once labeled as a "bad element" by Wang XX, wife of China's Khrushchev, and now the responsible person of Taoyuan Brigade, led everyone in studying Chairman Mao's quotations: "One of our important tasks on the ideological front at present is to carry out a criticism of revisionism." Following this, a battle to criticize China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionism was launched in the field.

	We Have Decided to Follow the Dazhai Path!

China's Khrushchev dispatched his wife Wang XX to Taoyuan to carry out so-called "on-site investigation," aiming to turn Taoyuan into a black experimental site for restoring capitalism, opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and resisting Chairman Mao's great call to "learn from Dazhai in agriculture." Team leader Chen Zhanchun and old poor peasant Zhao Yanshen spoke one after another: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support," the Dazhai path we have decided to follow!

They said: When it comes to Wang XX promoting material incentives here, we are so angry we grind our teeth! China's Khrushchev and his wife have really harmed us. For many years, it is thanks to Mao Zedong Thought that we, the poor and lower-middle peasants and the broad masses of commune members, have achieved bumper harvests year after year with our own two hands. However, China's Khrushchev and his wife turned our Taoyuan into a black experimental site for "fake socialist education, true restoration," directly opposing Chairman Mao's great instruction to "learn from Dazhai in agriculture." They used state funds to promote material incentives and spread a counter-revolutionary economism black wind here. To make the "Taoyuan point" "surpass" Dazhai, Wang XX forced the province, special district, and county to "meet needs, supply on time, prioritize Taoyuan" in material supply. Originally, our brigade had already raised a sum of money through self-reliance, planning to electrify and build water conservancy projects. However, after Wang XX arrived, to promote China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary economism, she insisted on diverting state funds totaling 644,000 yuan to build two electric water-lifting stations, two electric water-lifting points, three machine wells, and lay 42 kilometers of high-voltage power lines and 34 kilometers of low-voltage power lines leading to Taoyuan. She also dug a 6-kilometer irrigation main canal. From 1964 to 1966, a total of 153,000 jin of chemical fertilizer was "allocated" to Taoyuan Brigade. Neighboring team members commented: "Taoyuan applies chemical fertilizer by the handful, we apply it by pinching." "Even if the chemical fertilizer water flows into our fields, the crops can still grow well." To achieve their unspoken goals, China's Khrushchev and his wife threw state funds into our Taoyuan, deceiving some of our commune members to forget the good tradition of self-reliance and hard work, fostering a dependent mindset of relying on the state. As a result, not only did the grain yield not increase, but it also decreased year by year, and the state's grain procurement task was not completed.

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao, through revolutionary criticism and struggle, we saw through China's Khrushchev's wolfish ambitions of promoting material incentives and restoring capitalism in Taoyuan. We resolutely followed Chairman Mao's teachings, learned from the revolutionary spirit of the people of Dazhai, and further carried forward the revolutionary tradition of self-reliance and hard work. Last spring plowing season, when fertilizer was insufficient, we studied Chairman Mao's works and made up our minds to overcome difficulties. The entire village, men, women, old, and young, launched a vigorous fertilizer accumulation movement. We were not afraid of the cold; we sang songs of Chairman Mao's quotations: "With determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." Through the joint struggle of the commune members, we finally solved the fertilizer problem. After that, just as the wheat was heading, a sudden "neck-choking" drought hit. We studied the "Three Articles" and thought that every grain of wheat harvested was a contribution to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. The cadres and commune members joined forces, using buckets and basins to carry water from two li away. After a few days of struggle, we managed to water the 200-plus mu of drought-affected wheat thoroughly. Thus, last year, without asking the state for a single cent or a jin of chemical fertilizer, our grain yield increased by 160,000 jin compared to the previous year, and we exceeded the state's procurement quota. This is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, a result of our response to Chairman Mao's great call to learn from Dazhai and promote the revolutionary transformation of people's thinking.

Chairman Mao teaches: "We advocate self-reliance." We resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, follow the Dazhai path, the socialist path, and the communist path. The material incentives promoted by China's Khrushchev are a slow-acting poison and morphine needle for restoring capitalism. They want to buy the hearts of us poor and lower-middle peasants with money, making us suffer twice. This is absolutely impossible, a million times impossible! We poor and lower-middle peasants are infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao and will follow Chairman Mao to revolutionize for life.

	We Farm Not for Survival, But for Revolution!

Through his wife Wang XX, China's Khrushchev extensively promoted the bourgeois philosophy of life of "farming for survival, living for a lifetime of eating and wearing" in Taoyuan, attempting to make the poor and lower-middle peasants forget class struggle, forget proletarian dictatorship, forget revolution, turn private into revisionist, and make capitalism revive through "private." Young commune members Liu Aiguang and Guan Guizhen said: We farm not for survival, but for revolution. We will never allow China's Khrushchev's plot to succeed.

They said: Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our army is completely for the liberation of the people and is working wholeheartedly for the people's interests." However, through his wife Wang XX, China's Khrushchev extensively promoted the bourgeois philosophy of life of "farming for survival, living for a lifetime of eating and wearing." During their so-called "on-site investigation" in Taoyuan, one of their slogans was: "Eat white (rice), burn black (coal), light bright (electric lights), listen to singing (broadcasts)." Wang XX said: "We can't just eat wheat; we should also eat rice!" Thus, disregarding the soil conditions, they forced us to plant rice. The first year, 110 mu were planted, but due to the sandy soil not retaining water, the yield was severely reduced; the second year, they forced us to change the location and plant 170 mu, with the same severe reduction in yield. Thus, due to irrigation, 2,000-plus yuan in electricity fees and 3,000-plus man-days of labor were wasted, and 30,000-plus jin of grain was lost. In the end, they had to change the rice fields back to corn, and the land took two years to recover. In the end, they harmed the state and deceived us.

It is clear that the plot of China's Khrushchev and his wife is to lure us poor and lower-middle peasants to only care about personal life, forget the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people, forget farming for revolution, forget class struggle and proletarian dictatorship, so as to facilitate their restoration of capitalism. What "eat white, burn black, light bright, listen to singing" is nothing but the genuine revisionist goods of "potatoes and beef" from Khrushchev of the Soviet Union. If we follow this path, we will be further away from socialism and communism, the "private" will increase more, and capitalism will be restored in the countryside. We will suffer twice and be harmed twice. Beware, China's Khrushchev! You are daydreaming! We farm to consolidate proletarian dictatorship, to "prepare for war, prepare for famine, and serve the people," to build socialism and communism, and to contribute to the Chinese revolution and the world revolution.

Farming for revolution and farming for survival is a struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines. It is a major issue concerning whether to follow the socialist road and whether our country will change color. Farming for revolution is Chairman Mao's consistent teaching and the wish of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants. We will definitely further study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, carry out the revolutionary transformation of people's thinking, and farm for revolution for life, with our hearts in the fields, our eyes on the country, and our minds on the world.

	"Profit-Oriented" is a Big Poisonous Snake!

Through his wife Wang XX, China's Khrushchev extensively promoted capitalist forces in Taoyuan, extensively promoted "profit-oriented," and launched a fierce attack on the socialist system. Poor peasant commune member Zhao Tiejin pointed out sharply: "Profit-oriented" is a big poisonous snake!

He said: China's Khrushchev and his wife Wang XX tried every means to push us poor and lower-middle peasants into the capitalist quagmire. Wang XX extensively promoted capitalist management, extensively promoted "profit-oriented," disregarding the party's policies and the interests of the broad masses of the people, colluding with us to set up noodle shops, flour mills, and other sideline businesses, traveling from village to village, peddling grain, and making illegal profits.

China's Khrushchev said: "Without adding some money, production enthusiasm is not enough, and you won't produce well." This is the greatest slander against us poor and lower-middle peasants. We will definitely criticize and expose China's Khrushchev's "profit-oriented" business.

Chairman Mao says: "The masses have a great socialist enthusiasm." He also says: "The main force that has been fighting hard in the countryside is the poor peasants." This is the great leader Chairman Mao's greatest trust and highest evaluation of us poor and lower-middle peasants. Chairman Mao supports us, and we will make Chairman Mao proud. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants of Taoyuan actively respond to Chairman Mao's great call, resolutely follow the bright socialist road, and thoroughly settle the accounts of China's Khrushchev's promotion of capitalist management.

What kind of vine produces what kind of melon, what kind of class speaks what kind of words. Beware, China's Khrushchev! No matter what tricks you play, you cannot shake our determination to follow the socialist road. Currently, it is the spring plowing season. We, Taoyuan Brigade, have moved the Mao Zedong Thought study class and the battlefield of revolutionary criticism and struggle to the fields. We will definitely use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, with "criticize and repudiate revisionism" as the key link, thoroughly purge all the revisionist poison spread by China's Khrushchev in Taoyuan, and turn Taoyuan into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

	"Small Contracts" is Poison!

Through his wife Wang XX, China's Khrushchev crazily promoted "three autonomies and one contract" and other counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods in Taoyuan. She divided the production team into smaller units, implemented "small contracts," and said: "No matter how it is done, as long as the grain is increased, it is fine." As a result, not only was production not increased, but the commune members' thinking was also poisoned. Old poor peasant Gao Hongyu said in criticism: "Small contracts" is poison.

He said: Chairman Mao teaches us that politics is the commander, the soul, "political work is the lifeline of all economic work." China's Khrushchev, however, opposes emphasizing proletarian politics and tries every means to prevent us poor and lower-middle peasants from studying the great Mao Zedong Thought. Wang XX in Taoyuan never mentioned studying Mao Zedong Thought. She is full of evil schemes, telling us to divide the production team into smaller units, implement "small contracts," saying "contract work is fast, more work points, and he will like to work." This is sheer nonsense. We poor and lower-middle peasants are absolutely not like her, money-crazed, with money in our heads.

The "small contracts" promoted by China's Khrushchev and his wife Wang XX are soft knives. Their evil plot is to try to lure commune members to pursue money and material, achieving their goal of destroying the collective economy and restoring capitalism.

China's Khrushchev wants us to work for their restoration of capitalism, which is absolutely impossible. He opposes the masses studying Mao Zedong Thought and opposes emphasizing proletarian politics. We poor and lower-middle peasants will definitely emphasize proletarian politics and study and apply Mao Zedong Thought for life. We will definitely put emphasizing proletarian politics, studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and promoting the revolutionary transformation of people's thinking at the forefront of all work. Currently, our brigade, production team, cadres, and commune members' families have all set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, extensively set up revolutionary criticism and struggle battlefields, criticize and repudiate selfishness and revisionism, not for fame or profit, wholeheartedly for the revolution, and there are many good people and good deeds.

Facts have proven that emphasizing proletarian politics makes everything smooth. Following China's Khrushchev's promotion of "material incentives" and "work points-oriented" will only push us poor and lower-middle peasants into the "private" quagmire. We will definitely wield the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, continue to carry out revolutionary criticism and struggle for a long time, and thoroughly purge all the revisionist poison spread by China's Khrushchev in Taoyuan. Let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly high and forever in our Taoyuan!

There were still many commune members who wanted to speak. However, the work time was almost up. Comrade Wu Chen stood up and summarized. He said: Through this revolutionary criticism and struggle, we have seen more clearly the black hearts of China's Khrushchev and his wife Wang XX. They invested heavily in Taoyuan, but in fact, they were firing sugar-coated bullets at us. They wanted to use material incentives and promote counter-revolutionary economism to lure us towards capitalism. We must peel off their disguises and see through their essence of restoring capitalism. Currently, it is the busy spring plowing season. Doing a good job in this year's spring plowing production is a major task related to the overall victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Especially this year, there is drought and little rain, and there are many difficulties. We have decided not to rely on heaven, not to rely on the earth, and not to rely on the state. We will definitely rely on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to win the spring plowing battle. We will take Dazhai as an example, strive for self-improvement, be self-reliant, and strive to increase production based on last year's bumper harvest, contributing to the overall victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The criticism meeting ended. Amidst the resounding song of "With determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory," everyone returned to the intense labor. (Xinhua News Agency Correspondent)

    听毛主席的话，走大寨的路，彻底批臭中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命经济主义
    ——记桃园大队的一次地头批判会
    河北省抚宁县卢王庄公社桃园大队贫下中农和革命干部，遵照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，坚持开展革命大批判，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义的流毒。他们先后召开批判中国赫鲁晓夫的各种会一千三百多次，大大提高了阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟。春耕大忙季节到来以后，这个大队又结合春耕生产中的问题，狠批了中国赫鲁晓夫和他老婆王××在这里散布的反革命经济主义流毒。贫下中农社员和革命干部坚定地表示，一定听毛主席的话，学大寨人，走大寨路，发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗、为革命种田的精神，进一步办好社会主义集体经济。下面记述的，就是桃园大队第四生产队社员最近在春耕生产第一线上召开的一次地头批判会的情况。
    这天下午，第四生产队社员、干部四十多人用平整土地的休息时间，围坐在毛主席像前。曾经被中国赫鲁晓夫的老婆王××打成“坏分子”的原大队党支部书记、桃园大队现在的负责人吴臣同志，首先领着大家学习毛主席语录：“我们现在思想战线上的一个重要任务，就是要开展对于修正主义的批判。”接着，一场批判中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义的“人民战争”就在地头上打响了。
      大寨的路我们走定了！
    中国赫鲁晓夫指派他的老婆王××在桃园搞所谓“蹲点”，就是要把桃园变成复辟资本主义、反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线、对抗毛主席“农业学大寨”的伟大号召的黑试验场。生产队长陈占春和老贫农赵砚臣先后发言说：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护”，大寨的路我们走定了！
    他们说：提起王××在我们这里搞物质刺激的事，真是恨得直咬牙！中国赫鲁晓夫和他老婆可把咱们坑苦了。多少年来，咱们桃园就是靠着毛泽东思想，用咱贫下中农和广大社员两只手夺取了一年又一年的丰收。可是中国赫鲁晓夫和他老婆把咱们桃园作为“假四清，真复辟”的黑试验场，直接对抗毛主席“农业学大寨”的伟大指示。他们拿着国家的钱，在这里大搞物质刺激，大刮反革命经济主义黑风。为了使“桃园点”“超过”大寨，王××强迫省、专区、县在物资供应上要“满足需要，及时供应，优先桃园。”本来咱们大队已经自力更生地筹集了一笔资金，准备办电和修水利。可是王××来后，为了推行中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命经济主义，硬要调拨国家资金六十四万四千元，在桃园修了两个电力扬水站，两个电力扬水点，三眼机井，架设通向桃园的高压输电线四十二华里，低压配电线三十四华里，还挖了一条六华里的灌溉干渠。一九六四年到一九六六年，共“照顾”了桃园大队化肥十五万三千多斤。邻队社员反映说：“桃园施化肥大把抓，我们施化肥用手掐。”“桃园地里的化肥水流到我们地里也能长好庄稼。”中国赫鲁晓夫和他老婆为了达到他们不可告人的目的，就是这样拿着国家的钱往咱们桃园投，蒙蔽着咱们的一些社员忘记了自力更生、艰苦奋斗的好传统，滋长了向国家伸手的依赖思想，粮食不仅没有增产，而且产量逐年下降，国家粮食征购任务也没有完成。
    我们在毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，通过革命大批判，看透了中国赫鲁晓夫在桃园大搞物质刺激，复辟资本主义的狼子野心。我们坚决按照毛主席的教导，学习大寨人的革命精神，进一步发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命传统。去年春耕时节，肥料不足。我们学习了毛主席著作，下定决心，克服困难。全村男女老少，掀起了轰轰烈烈的积肥运动。天冷我们不怕，我们高唱毛主席语录歌：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”经过社员们共同奋战，终于解决了肥料问题。这以后，正当小麦扬花的时候，突然又遇到了“掐脖”旱。我们学习了“老三篇”，想到多打一粒粮食，就是为中国革命和世界革命多出一把力。干部、社员拧成一股劲，用水桶、脸盆从二里地以外挑水、端水。经过几天的奋战，硬是把受旱的二百多亩小麦浇了一遍透水。就这样，去年我们没有向国家要一分钱、一斤化肥，粮食产量却比前年增加了十六万斤，超额完成了国家征购任务。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是我们响应毛主席伟大号召，学习大寨，促进人的思想革命化的结果。
    毛主席教导说：“我们是主张自力更生的。”我们坚决照毛主席的指示办事，走大寨的道路，走社会主义的道路，走共产主义的道路。中国赫鲁晓夫搞的物质刺激，是退往资本主义的慢性毒药，是吗啡针。他们要想用金钱收买我们贫下中农的心，要我们重受二遍苦，这一千个办不到，一万个办不到！我们贫下中农无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席，要跟着毛主席干一辈子革命。
        我们种田不是为了活命，
    而是为了革命！
    中国赫鲁晓夫通过他老婆王××在桃园大肆宣扬“种田为活命，一生一世为吃穿”的资产阶级人生哲学，妄图使贫下中农忘记阶级斗争，忘记无产阶级专政，忘记革命，由私变修，使资本主义借“私”还魂。青年社员刘爱光和关桂珍说：我们种田不是为了活命，而是为了革命。我们绝不允许中国赫鲁晓夫的阴谋得逞。
    他们说：毛主席教导我们：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”可是，中国赫鲁晓夫通过他的老婆王××大肆宣扬“种田为活命，一生一世为吃穿”的资产阶级人生哲学。他们在桃园搞所谓“蹲点”时，有个口号是：“吃白的（大米）、烧黑的（煤炭）、点亮的（电灯）、听唱的（广播）。”王××说：“不能光吃小麦，还要吃大米嘛！”于是就不顾土质条件，强迫我们种水稻。头一年种了一百一十亩，因沙土存不住水，严重减产；第二年又强迫换地方再种一百七十亩，同样严重减产。就这样，因灌溉耗费电费两千多元，费工三千多个，减产三万多斤。最后只好把稻田又改种玉米，土地两年也缓不过劲来。到头来害了国家，坑了我们。
    很明显，中国赫鲁晓夫和他的老婆的阴谋，就是勾引我们贫下中农只关心个人生活，忘掉广大人民群众的根本利益，忘掉为革命种田，忘掉阶级斗争和无产阶级专政，以便于他们搞资本主义复辟。什么“吃白的、烧黑的、点亮的、听唱的”，这是地地道道的苏联赫鲁晓夫“土豆烧牛肉”的修正主义黑货。照这一套走下去，离社会主义、共产主义就越来越远，“私”字就越来越多，资本主义就会在农村复辟，我们贫下中农就会吃二遍苦、受二遍罪。警告你，中国赫鲁晓夫！你这是白日作梦！我们种田，是为了巩固无产阶级专政，是“备战、备荒、为人民”，是为了建设社会主义和共产主义，是为了中国革命和世界革命。
    为革命种田和为活命种田，这是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争。这是关系到要不要走社会主义道路，我们国家变不变颜色的大问题。为革命种田，是毛主席的一贯教导，是广大贫下中农的心愿。我们一定进一步活学活用毛泽东思想，搞好人的思想革命化，做到身在田间，眼望全国，胸怀全球，为革命种一辈子田。
      “利润挂帅”是条大毒蛇！
    中国赫鲁晓夫通过他老婆王××在桃园极力发展资本主义势力，大搞“利润挂帅”，向社会主义制度猖狂进攻。贫农社员赵铁金一针见血地指出：“利润挂帅”是条大毒蛇！
    他说：中国赫鲁晓夫和他的老婆王××，想方设法把我们贫下中农往资本主义泥坑里推。王××大肆鼓吹资本主义经营，大搞利润挂帅，不顾党的政策和广大人民群众的利益，拉拢我们开设挂面房、杂面房等副业，串村赶集，倒卖粮食，从中捞取非法利润。
    中国赫鲁晓夫胡说什么：“不加点钱，生产积极性不够，不好好给你生产。”这是对我们贫下中农最大的诬蔑。我们要坚决把中国赫鲁晓夫“利润挂帅”的生意经批倒批臭。
    毛主席说：“群众中蕴藏了一种极大的社会主义的积极性。”还说：“乡村中一向苦战奋斗的主要力量是贫农。”这是伟大领袖毛主席对我们贫下中农最大的信任，最高的评价。毛主席给我们撑腰，我们给毛主席争气。我们桃园广大贫下中农积极响应毛主席的伟大号召，坚决走社会主义光明大道，彻底清算了中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹资本主义经营的滔天罪行。
    什么藤结什么瓜，什么阶级说什么话。警告中国赫鲁晓夫，不管你玩弄什么鬼花招，也动摇不了我们走社会主义道路的决心。目前正是春耕季节，我们桃园大队把毛泽东思想学习班，把革命大批判的战场，搬到了田间地头。我们一定要以毛泽东思想为武器，以“斗私，批修”为纲，把中国赫鲁晓夫在桃园散布的一切修正主义流毒彻底肃清，把桃园办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
        “小包工”是砒霜！
    中国赫鲁晓夫通过他的老婆王××在桃园疯狂地推行“三自一包”等反革命修正主义黑货。她把生产队划小，实行“小包工”，胡说什么：“不管怎么搞，只要把粮食搞上去就行。”结果不仅生产没有搞上去，社员的思想也受到了毒害。老贫农高洪于在批判时说：“小包工”是砒霜。
    他说：毛主席教导我们，政治是统帅，是灵魂，“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”中国赫鲁晓夫却反对突出无产阶级政治，千方百计不让我们贫下中农学习伟大的毛泽东思想。王××在桃园从来不提学习毛泽东思想。她满肚子坏水往外掏，叫我们把生产队划小，实行“小包工”，说什么“包工干活快，多给工分，他就爱干。”这简直是胡说八道。我们贫下中农绝不是象她那样的财迷，钱串脑袋。
    中国赫鲁晓夫和他的老婆王××鼓吹的“小包工”，是软刀子。他们的罪恶阴谋，就是妄图引诱社员追求金钱、物质，达到他破坏集体经济，实现资本主义复辟的目的。
    中国赫鲁晓夫妄想叫我们为他们复辟资本主义效劳，这是万万办不到的。他反对群众学习毛泽东思想，反对突出无产阶级政治，我们贫下中农就要坚决突出无产阶级政治，一辈子活学活用毛泽东思想。我们一定把突出无产阶级政治、活学活用毛泽东思想、促进人的思想革命化，摆在一切工作的首位。现在我们大队、生产队，干部、社员家庭，都办起了毛泽东思想学习班，大摆革命大批判的战场，斗私批修，不为名，不为利，全心全意为革命，好人好事多得很。
    事实证明，突出了无产阶级政治，一通百通。照中国赫鲁晓夫那样大搞“物质刺激”、“工分挂帅”，只有把我们贫下中农推进“私”字的泥坑。我们一定要奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，继续持久地开展革命大批判，把中国赫鲁晓夫在桃园散布的一切修正主义流毒统统肃清。让毛泽东思想伟大红旗在我们桃园高高飘扬，永远飘扬！
    还有不少社员要求发言。但是，干活的时间快到了。吴臣同志站起来作了小结。他说：通过这次革命大批判，我们更清楚地看到了中国赫鲁晓夫和他的老婆王××的黑心。他们往桃园大量“投资”，其实是向我们发射糖衣炮弹。他们就是要通过物质刺激，通过搞反革命经济主义，妄想把我们拉向资本主义。我们一定要剥开他们的画皮，看透他们搞资本主义复辟的本质。目前正是春耕大忙季节，搞好今年的春耕生产，是关系到无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的大事。特别是今年干旱缺雨，困难不少，咱们决心一不靠天，二不靠地，决不伸手依赖国家。我们就是要靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想打胜春耕这一仗。我们要以大寨为榜样，奋发图强，自力更生，争取在去年丰收的基础上再来个增产，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利立新功。
    批判会结束了。大家在“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的嘹亮歌声中，投入了紧张的劳动。　（新华社通讯员）
