In the face of the new upsurge in the struggle against violence by the broad masses of black people in the United States, our great leader Chairman Mao has issued a statement "In Support of the American Blacks in Their Struggle Against Violence." Chairman Mao's great statement expresses the firm will of the 700 million people of our country. It is a powerful ideological weapon for the people of the world in their struggle against U.S. imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries. It is the greatest concern, encouragement, and support for the black people and the broad laboring masses of the United States. It points out the road to complete liberation for the black people and all oppressed peoples and nations.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has given a high evaluation of the struggle of the American blacks against violence. Chairman Mao points out: "The struggle of the American blacks is not only a struggle for freedom and liberation by the oppressed and exploited blacks but also a new call to arms for the entire oppressed and exploited American people in their struggle against the brutal rule of the monopoly capitalist class."

This new storm of the black people's struggle is the result of the long-term brutal exploitation, discrimination, and persecution of the black people by the ruling clique of the United States. It is the result of the ruling clique of the United States stepping up its policy of aggression and war abroad and its fascist policy at home.

Chairman Mao points out: "This storm of the black people's struggle has broken out within the United States and is a prominent manifestation of the current political and economic crises of U.S. imperialism." For a long time, the black people of the United States have been living at the very bottom of the rotten capitalist society. They have been deeply afflicted by class oppression and racial discrimination, leading a miserable life worse than that of cattle. The U.S. imperialist war of aggression against Vietnam has further deepened the calamity of the American blacks. As U.S. imperialism sinks deeper into an insoluble political and economic crisis, it will inevitably heap even heavier oppression on the broad masses of black people and the laboring people of the United States. In this way, class contradictions within the United States will inevitably become increasingly acute. Where there is oppression, there is resistance. It is precisely the fascist rule of U.S. imperialism that has sparked an unprecedented new storm of the black people's struggle against violence in American history.

The struggle of the American blacks is a great encouragement and support for the anti-U.S. struggle of the peoples of all countries. The black people are revolting in the heart of U.S. imperialism, and the flames of their struggle are blazing. This has plunged U.S. imperialism, which is already at its wits' end because of its defeat in the war of aggression against Vietnam and the worsening dollar crisis, into an even more precarious situation both at home and abroad. This greatly ties down and weakens the forces of U.S. imperialism. The struggle of the American blacks supports the peoples of all countries. The peoples of the whole world will certainly firmly respond to Chairman Mao's great call to arms and support the just struggle of the American blacks. In this way, the oppressed peoples and nations of the whole world, supporting and cooperating with one another, will be able to launch a sustained and fierce offensive against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys and bury U.S. imperialism all the sooner.

    在美帝心脏里面造反
    总后勤部机关无产阶级革命派
    在美国广大黑人群众掀起抗暴斗争新高潮的大好形势下，我们伟大领袖毛主席发表了《支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明》。毛主席的伟大声明，表达了我国七亿人民的坚强意志，是世界人民反对美帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的强大思想武器，是对美国黑人和广大劳动人民的最大关怀、最大鼓舞、最大支持，为美国黑人和一切被压迫人民和民族指明了彻底解放的道路。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席对美国黑人抗暴斗争给了高度的评价。毛主席指出：“美国黑人的斗争，不仅是被剥削、被压迫的黑人争取自由解放的斗争，而且是整个被剥削、被压迫的美国人民反对垄断资产阶级残暴统治的新号角。”
    这次黑人斗争新风暴，是美国统治集团长期以来对黑人实行残酷剥削、歧视和迫害的结果，是美国统治集团在国外加紧推行侵略政策和战争政策，在国内加紧推行法西斯政策的结果。
    毛主席指出：“这场黑人的斗争风暴发生在美国国内，是美帝国主义当前整个政治危机和经济危机的一个突出表现。”长期以来，美国黑人，一直生活在腐朽透顶的资本主义社会的最底层，他们深受阶级压迫和种族歧视，过着暗无天日、牛马不如的悲惨生活。美帝国主义进行的侵越战争，更加深了美国黑人的灾难。随着美帝国主义陷入不可解脱的政治危机和经济危机，必然把更加沉重的压迫加在广大黑人和美国的劳动人民头上。这样，美国国内的阶级矛盾就不可避免地日益激烈起来。哪里有压迫，哪里就有反抗，正是美帝国主义实行的法西斯统治，激起了美国历史上前所未有的黑人抗暴斗争新风暴。
    美国黑人的斗争，对世界各国人民的反美斗争，是一个巨大的鼓舞和支援。美国黑人在美帝国主义心脏里面造反，斗争的烈火熊熊燃烧，使本来已经被侵越战争的惨败和美元危机的恶化弄得走投无路的美帝国主义，更加陷入了内外交困的境地。这就大大地牵制和削弱了美帝国主义的力量。美国黑人斗争支援了各国人民，全世界人民一定会坚决响应毛主席的伟大战斗号召，支持美国黑人的正义斗争。这样，全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族，互相支持，互相配合，向着美帝国主义及其帮凶们发动持久的猛烈的进攻，就能更快地把美帝国主义埋葬。
