With Great Mao Zedong Thought on board, invincible! Longhai County's spring tide production achieves continuous victories. Over eighty mechanized sailboats in the entire county caught more than 1,300 tons of small white fish in just ten days, completing the first quarter's fishing production plan fifteen days ahead of schedule.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, April 3rd: As one of the major fishing areas in Liaoning Province, Longhai County's revolutionary committees in various communes have, during the spring tide production, placed everything under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, seized the opportunity for production, and launched the first offensive in spring tide production. Over eighty mechanized sailboats in the entire county caught more than 1,300 tons of small white fish in just ten days, completing the first quarter's fishing production plan fifteen days ahead of schedule and exceeding the plan by more than one hundred percent. The total production is more than double that of the same period last year.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Once the political line is determined, cadres are the decisive factor." Before the spring tide production, revolutionary committees were established in various communes in Longhai County. The new leading cadres closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, grasped revolution, and promoted production. Members of the revolutionary committees in various communes, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "sum up achievements, correct mistakes, and prepare for the next battle," worked together with experienced old fishermen to summarize the experiences of spring tide production over the past few years. Based on the old fishermen's experiences, they organized fishermen to go to sea early to new fishing grounds to intercept fish schools. In this year's spring tide production, they launched an offensive and achieved a bumper harvest.

In the past, cadres in charge of marine production would go to sea with the ships on good days but not on bad days; they spent more time on land and less time on the ships. This year, members of the revolutionary committees in various communes, following the instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao to "politically lead and go among the masses," went to sea with the fishermen. They held study classes of Mao Zedong Thought on the ships and studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions together with the fishermen, actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works. They followed Chairman Mao's instruction to "consult with the masses on every matter and be a student of the masses" and humbly learned from the fishermen, treating old fishermen as their teachers. For example, when capturing fishing grounds, they organized fishermen to discuss and listen to the fishermen's opinions, accurately determining the position of the main fishing ground for this spring tide. Therefore, the fishing ships started production and encountered large fish schools. The "Three-Eight" ship of Zhanzi Commune caught more than 20,000 pounds of small white fish on the first day. Old fishermen said: "Fishing does not rely on the weather, with Mao Zedong Thought, we are victorious," "The new leading cadres are good. They can follow Chairman Mao's instructions and listen to our words. They bring Mao Zedong Thought on board and lead us to achieve double victories in revolution and production."

After the spring tide production battle drums were sounded, members of the revolutionary committees in various communes, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "carry forward the spirit of bravery, fearlessness of sacrifice, fearlessness of fatigue, and continuous fighting (i.e., fighting several battles in a short period without rest)," organized fishing ships to press on and fight day and night. Seeing that the members of the revolutionary committees placed proletarian politics in command and had great determination and enthusiasm for spring tide production, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of fishermen was greatly aroused. This year's spring tide production achieved continuous victories. The net catch increased from 400 boxes to 800 boxes. The daily catch of pair trawlers increased from 20,000 pounds to 40,000 pounds. The production of many fishing ships reached more than 80,000 pounds per voyage. The sixteen mechanized sailboats of Haiyang People's Commune, which was the first to establish a revolutionary committee in the entire county, completed the first quarter's fish production plan in the first voyage.

    带着伟大毛泽东思想上船无往不胜
    长海县春汛生产连战连捷
    全县八十余只机帆船十天就捕获小白鱼一千三百多吨，提前十五天超额完成了第一季度捕鱼生产计划
    新华社沈阳三日电辽宁省主要渔业区之一的长海县，各公社革命委员会在春汛生产中，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，抓住生产时机，打主动仗，打响了春汛生产第一炮。全县八十余只机帆船十天就捕获小白鱼一千三百多吨，提前十五天超额完成了第一季度捕鱼生产计划，总产量比去年同期增加了一倍多。
    毛主席教导我们：“政治路线确定之后，干部就是决定的因素。”长海县各公社在春汛生产前都先后建立了革命委员会。新的领导班子紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠抓革命，猛促生产。各公社革委会的成员，遵照毛主席“发扬成绩，纠正错误，以利再战”的教导，同有经验的老渔民一起总结了几年来春汛生产的经验。他们根据老渔民的经验，组织渔民提前出海到新渔场去迎阻鱼群，在今年春汛生产中，打了一场主动仗，获得了大丰收。
    过去干部抓海上生产，好天随船出海的多，坏天随船出海的少；在陆地上的时间长，到渔船上的时间短。今年各公社革委会的成员遵照我们伟大领袖毛主席“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去”的教导，同渔民一起出海，在船上大办毛泽东思想学习班，和渔民共同学习毛主席的最新指示，共同活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想统帅春汛生产。他们在参加劳动，指挥生产中，遵照毛主席“遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生”的教导，虚心向渔民学习，拜老渔工为师。如在抓渔场时，他们组织渔民座谈讨论，听取渔民的意见，准确地确定今年春汛中心渔场的位置。因此渔船一开始生产就遇上了大鱼群。獐子公社“三八”号对船，第一天就捕获小白鱼二万多斤。老渔工们说：“打鱼不靠天，有了毛泽东思想就是胜利”，“新的领导班子就是好。毛主席的指示他们能照办，我们的话他们也能听，他们带着毛泽东思想上船，就能带领我们夺取革命生产双丰收。”
    春汛生产战鼓擂响后，各公社革委会的成员又遵照毛主席“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风”的教导，组织渔船乘胜追击，昼夜奋战。广大渔民看到革委会成员突出无产阶级政治，抓春汛生产决心大、干劲足，生产积极性也大大地调动起来了。今年的春汛生产连战连胜。网产量由四百箱增加到八百箱。对船日产由二万斤增加到四万斤。不少渔船的航次产量都达八万斤以上。全县首先建立革命委员会的海洋人民公社的十六只机帆船，第一个航次就超额完成了第一季度产鱼计划。
