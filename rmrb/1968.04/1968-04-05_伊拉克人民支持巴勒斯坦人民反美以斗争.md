A large-scale demonstration was held in Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, a few days ago to support the Palestinian people's armed struggle against U.S.-Israeli aggression and for national liberation in the occupied Palestinian territories.

Workers, peasants, and students participated in this demonstration. They chanted slogans against U.S. imperialism and Israeli aggressors during the march. They declared their refusal to accept any so-called "political solution" to the Palestinian issue and expressed their determination to support the Palestinian people's armed struggle until the entire Palestinian territory is liberated from the occupation of Israel, the tool of U.S. imperialism.

    参加这次示威游行的有工人、农民和学生。他们在游行中高喊反对美帝国主义和以色列侵略者等口号。他们表示拒绝接受在巴勒斯坦问题上的所谓
  “政治解决办法”，并且表示决心支持巴勒斯坦人民的武装斗争，直到整个巴勒斯坦从美帝国主义的侵略工具以色列的占领下解放出来为止。
