Recently, a section of workers in our workshop showed signs of anarchism, which affected the normal progress of the revolution and production. Many veteran workers came to us, requesting that the revolutionary committee mobilize the masses to formulate a pact for "seizing the revolution and promoting production." We thought the veteran workers' suggestion was very good and immediately accepted it.

We realized that opposing anarchism relies on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, relies on highlighting proletarian politics, and relies on doing thorough ideological and political work. Therefore, in the process of formulating the pact, we placed leading with Mao Zedong Thought and doing good ideological and political work in the first position.

Before formulating the pact, the first task we undertook was to organize the workers to hold evening classes on Mao Zedong Thought, mobilizing revolutionary workers in the workshop to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings on opposing anarchism, allowing the broad revolutionary masses to grasp Mao Zedong Thought as the most powerful weapon. On the basis of raising awareness, we widely mobilized the masses to launch a criticism of anarchism. During this period, the broad revolutionary masses consciously used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, extensively criticizing the evil schemes of Chinese Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the party who spread anarchism, exposing the manifestations of anarchism, discussing the harms of anarchism, and digging out the roots of anarchism. Through the revolutionary criticism, the broad revolutionary masses further recognized that reactionary anarchism is a poisoned arrow used by the enemies of the proletariat to corrupt the working class, and correctly distinguished between the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat and anarchism, and between unreasonable old frameworks and reasonable regulations. In this way, a foundation was laid for establishing reasonable regulations and proletarian revolutionary discipline.

In the process of formulating the "Pact for Seizing the Revolution and Promoting Production," we timely grasped some of the active thoughts of the broad revolutionary masses and conducted targeted Mao Zedong Thought education. Among the revolutionary factions, some comrades considered themselves heroes, feeling that since they had taken power, everything should be decided by them, and it was okay to arrive at work a bit late. Some of the masses who had previously taken the wrong side had not yet completely changed their sentiments and had antagonistic feelings towards the revolutionary factions, and therefore did not work hard, and so on. To help the workers solve these active thoughts, we organized the workers to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought extensively, and organized veteran workers to recall and compare, conducting class education for the workers. The workers all expressed that they must not forget class bitterness, remember blood debts, fiercely struggle against the bourgeois "self" in their minds, and firmly establish the proletarian "public" spirit, exerting all their strength to seize the revolution and promote production, and create new achievements for building a great socialist motherland.

We also commended those revolutionary workers who had always guarded their posts, seized the revolution and promoted production, and resisted the anarchist evil winds. Among them were old workers, young workers, and apprentices, hoping that everyone would learn from them. At the same time, we also helped the workers solve some practical difficulties through home visits and heart-to-heart talks. As a result, the entire workshop quickly formed a wave of learning from each other, catching up, helping, and surpassing.

The facts have proven that once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the masses, it will turn into boundless material force. After this period of struggle, the revolutionary workers in our workshop finally formulated a pact for "seizing the revolution and promoting production" that is led by Mao Zedong Thought and fully relies on the conscious efforts of the revolutionary masses. Now, the anarchist phenomena in our workshop have basically been eliminated. In February, we only completed 80% of the production plan. In March, after formulating the pact, we completed the production task ahead of schedule and exceeded the quota. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, and a victorious result of fully implementing the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao. Through the formulation of the "Pact for Seizing the Revolution and Promoting Production," we are even more convinced that as long as we lead with Mao Zedong Thought, closely rely on the masses, and do thorough ideological and political work, we will definitely be able to eliminate all the filth of the bourgeoisie and turn the factory into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

    用毛泽东思想挂帅，依靠群众，就能办好企业
    修机车间革命委员会负责人　杨成山
    前一段时间，我们车间的一部分职工中出现了无政府主义的倾向，影响了革命和生产的正常进行。许多老工人纷纷找上门，要求革委会发动群众，制订一个抓革命促生产的公约。我们觉得老工人的意见提得很好，马上接受了。
    我们认识到，反对无政府主义，靠的是战无不胜的毛泽东思想，靠的是突出无产阶级政治，靠的是做深入细致的思想政治工作。因此，我们在制订公约的过程中，把用毛泽东思想挂帅，做好思想政治工作放在第一位。
    在制订公约之前，我们抓的第一项工作，就是发动职工大办业余毛泽东思想学习班，组织车间革命职工反复学习毛主席关于反对无政府主义的教导，让广大革命职工掌握毛泽东思想这个最强大的武器。在提高认识的基础上，我们广泛发动群众，开展了对无政府主义的批判。在这段时间里，广大革命职工自觉地用毛泽东思想作武器，大批中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派散布无政府主义的罪恶阴谋，大摆无政府主义的表现，大论无政府主义的危害，大挖无政府主义的根源。通过革命大批判，广大革命职工进一步认清了反动的无政府主义是无产阶级的敌人用来腐蚀工人阶级的一支毒箭，也正确地区分了无产阶级革命造反精神和无政府主义的区别、不合理的旧框框和合理的规章制度的区别。这样，就为建立合理的规章制度和无产阶级的革命纪律奠定了思想基础。
    在制订“抓革命，促生产公约”的过程中，我们及时抓住了广大革命职工的一些活思想，有的放矢地进行了毛泽东思想的教育。在革命派中，有些同志以功臣自居，觉得自己掌了权，什么都是自己说了算，上班晚一点也没有什么关系。有的过去站错了队的群众感情还没有完全扭过来，和革命派有对立情绪，因此不好好干活，等等。为了帮助职工们解决这些活思想，我们组织职工大学大用毛泽东思想，并且组织老工人回忆对比，向职工们进行阶级教育。职工们纷纷表示，一定要不忘阶级苦，牢记血泪仇，狠斗自己头脑里的资产阶级“私”字，大立无产阶级的“公”字，使出全身的劲来抓革命促生产，为建设伟大的社会主义祖国立新功。
    我们还表扬了那些一贯坚守岗位，抓革命促生产，顶住无政府主义歪风的革命职工，其中有老年工人、青年工人和学徒工，希望大家向他们学习。同时，我们还通过家庭访问和谈心活动，帮助职工解决一些实际困难。这样做的结果，全车间很快就形成了你追我赶的比学赶帮热潮。
    事实证明，毛泽东思想一旦为群众所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的物质力量。我们车间的革命职工经过这样一段斗争，终于制订出了一个毛泽东思想挂帅的、充分依靠革命群众自觉的“抓革命，促生产公约”。现在，我们车间的无政府主义现象已经基本消除。二月份我们只完成生产计划的百分之八十，三月份订了公约，就提前超额完成了生产任务。这是伟大的毛泽东思想的胜利，是全面落实伟大导师毛主席最新指示的胜利成果。通过“抓革命，促生产公约”的制订，我们更加坚信，只要用毛泽东思想挂帅，紧紧依靠群众，做深入细致的思想政治工作，我们就一定能够清除资产阶级的一切污泥浊水，把工厂办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
