In the new era of revolution under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and amidst a great situation both internationally and domestically, the sun in the hearts of the people of the world, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, issued the "Statement in Support of the Black People's Struggle in the United States." Chairman Mao's statement represents the voice of all the people of China, providing the greatest support and encouragement to the black people's struggle in the United States and the anti-imperialist struggle of the people of the world. It is a heavy blow to imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They appear terrifying, but in reality, they have no real power. From a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries, but to the people." American imperialism is just such a paper tiger. It appears formidable, but in reality, it has no real power. Domestically, it is being overwhelmed by the surging waves of the black people's struggle, leaving it in a state of panic and disarray. In Vietnam, it is being beaten to a pulp by the heroic Vietnamese people, finding itself in a desperate situation, on the brink of annihilation. It has conducted military provocations against the great people of China and has repeatedly been met with crushing defeats. On August 21 of last year, two American aggressor planes, A6-A type, intruded into our airspace to cause trouble. Facing the vicious American air pirates, we, with our unyielding loyalty to Chairman Mao and our iron will to defend Chairman Mao, guided by Chairman Mao's words, bravely joined the battle. We shot down the enemy plane in mid-air and captured a live American air pirate. This victory is a victory of the great Mao Zedong Thought. This battle once again proved that the so-called "air superiority" of the United States is nothing but a paper tiger in the face of the powerful Chinese people. We deeply feel that Chairman Mao's judgment that "all reactionaries are paper tigers" is extremely correct. Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful spiritual atom bomb, invincible and immensely powerful. Victory will surely belong to the black people of the United States and the oppressed peoples and nations of the world. The days of American imperialism are numbered.

We firmly support Chairman Mao's great statement and resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call to battle. We firmly support the black people's struggle in the United States and pledge to be a strong backing for the black people of the United States and the oppressed peoples and nations of the world. We must be a hundred times more vigilant, stand guard to defend Chairman Mao and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. As soon as the great leader Chairman Mao gives the order, we will immediately join the battle. Wherever the enemy comes from, we will resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate them there. For the complete liberation of all humanity, we will contribute all our strength, letting the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly high and forever in the world!

    美帝国主义是外强中干的纸老虎

    在世界进入了以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的革命新时代，在国际国内一派大好形势下，全世界人民心中最红的红太阳、我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，发表了《支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明》。毛主席的声明，代表了全中国人民的声音，是对美国黑人抗暴斗争和全世界人民反帝斗争的最大支持和最大鼓舞，是对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的一个沉重打击。
    毛主席教导我们：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”美帝国主义就是这样的一只纸老虎，看起来气势汹汹，其实并没有什么了不起的力量。它在国内，被黑人抗暴斗争的汹涌澎湃的浪潮打得狼狈不堪，惊恐万状；在越南，被英雄的越南人民打得焦头烂额，走投无路，陷入了灭顶之灾；它对伟大的中国人民进行军事挑衅，一再遭到了迎头痛击。去年八月二十一日，美国强盗飞机A6—A型两架窜入我国领空捣乱。面对着穷凶极恶的美国飞贼，我们依靠永远忠于毛主席的赤胆忠心和誓死保卫毛主席的钢铁意志，用毛主席的话指挥自己的行动，勇敢地投入了战斗。我们打得敌机临空爆炸，活捉了一名美国飞贼。这一次战斗的胜利，是伟大的毛泽东思想的胜利。这一次战斗，再一次证明了美国所谓“空中优势”，在强大的中国人民面前，也只不过是一只纸老虎。我们深深地体会到，毛主席的“一切反动派都是纸老虎”的论断是十分英明的。毛泽东思想是最强大的精神原子弹，是战无不胜的，威力无比的。胜利一定属于美国黑人和全世界被压迫人民、被压迫民族。美帝国主义寿命不会很长了。
    我们最坚决地拥护毛主席的伟大声明，最坚决地响应毛主席的战斗号召，坚决支持美国黑人的抗暴斗争，誓作美国黑人和全世界被压迫人民、被压迫民族的坚强后盾。我们要百倍提高警惕，为了保卫毛主席和无产阶级文化大革命而站好岗。只要伟大领袖毛主席一声令下，我们就立即投入战斗。敌人从那里来，我们就坚决、彻底、干净、全部地把他们消灭在那里，为全人类的彻底解放，贡献出我们的一切力量，让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，在全世界高高飘扬，永远飘扬！
