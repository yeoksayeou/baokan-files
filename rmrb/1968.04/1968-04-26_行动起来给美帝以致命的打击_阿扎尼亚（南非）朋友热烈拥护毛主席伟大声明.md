Take Action to Deal a Fatal Blow to U.S. Imperialism
Azania (South Africa) Friends Warmly Support Chairman Mao's Great Statement

According to a report from the New China News Agency in London, on the 18th, Azania (South Africa) Pan-Africanist Congress representative Wusongzi Ma Ke warmly hailed the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, for issuing a statement in support of the American black people's struggle against violence.

Ma Ke said: "All oppressed peoples of the world must use revolutionary violence to counter revolutionary violence."

He went on to point out: "In recent years, American blacks have been involved in fierce struggles against the enemy of humanity, U.S. imperialism, and through their own actions, they have proven that they can fight this giant at home and can fight effectively. This struggle proves that Chairman Mao's teaching that 'weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor; the decisive factor is people, not things' is correct."

He said: "Chairman Mao is right. The struggle of American blacks is a great support and encouragement to the struggle of the Vietnamese people. We hope that the peoples of Africa, Asia, and Latin America, who are still under imperialist oppression, will take action and deal a fatal blow to imperialism led by the United States."

Ma Ke emphasized: "Chairman Mao's call to all those in the world who are willing to oppose U.S. imperialism is of special significance. Chairman Mao calls on them to 'take action and give strong support to the struggle of American blacks,' and we believe that this call will be responded to. We can assure our brothers around the world that the Pan-Africanist Congress will respond to this call."

He also expressed his determination to fight resolutely against the racist regime in South Africa, because this regime is a lackey of U.S. imperialism.

Ma Ke finally shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the struggle of American blacks! Long live the struggle of the peoples of Africa, Asia, and Latin America!"

    行动起来给美帝以致命的打击
    阿扎尼亚（南非）朋友热烈拥护毛主席伟大声明
    据新华社伦敦电　阿扎尼亚（南非）泛非主义者大会代表伍松齐·马克十八日热烈欢呼世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席发表支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明。
    马克说：“全世界被压迫人民一定要用革命的暴力去对付反革命的暴力。”
    他接着指出：“近几年来，美国黑人卷入了反对人类的敌人美帝国主义的激烈斗争，并通过他们自己的行动证明，能够在自己国内同这个庞然大物作斗争，能够有成效地进行斗争。这场斗争证明，毛主席关于‘武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物’的教导是正确的。”
    他说：“毛主席说得很对，美国黑人的斗争是对越南人民斗争的一个巨大的支援和鼓舞。我们希望，仍处在帝国主义压迫下的非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲的人民行动起来，并给以美国为首的帝国主义以致命的打击。”
    马克强调指出：“毛主席向全世界愿意反对美帝国主义的人们发出的号召具有特别重大意义。毛主席号召他们‘行动起来，给予美国黑人的斗争以强大的声援’，我们相信，这一号召将会得到响应，我们能够向全世界的兄弟保证，我们泛非主义者大会将响应这一号召。”
    他还表示要向南非反动的种族主义政权进行坚决斗争，因为这个政权是美帝国主义的走狗。
    马克最后高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“美国黑人的斗争万岁！”“非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲人民的斗争万岁！”
