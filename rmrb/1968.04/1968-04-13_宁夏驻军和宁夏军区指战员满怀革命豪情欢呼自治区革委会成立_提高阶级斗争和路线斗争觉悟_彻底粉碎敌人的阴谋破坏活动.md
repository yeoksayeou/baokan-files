The troops stationed in Ningxia and the soldiers of the Ningxia Military Region are filled with revolutionary fervor and joyfully celebrate the birth of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee. They are determined to raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to unite more closely with the revolutionary people of all ethnic groups in Ningxia, to carry forward the thorough spirit of proletarian revolution, and to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end, not resting until complete victory is achieved!

On the joyous day of the establishment of the Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, the troops stationed in Ningxia and the various units of the Ningxia Military Region, from headquarters to platoons, from barracks to the front lines of "three supports, two militaries," are all decorated with red flags and filled with the sound of drums. The broad masses of soldiers and revolutionary people together carry the giant portrait of Chairman Mao, holding red copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," holding grand rallies and parades, and shouting with all their hearts: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand years!" "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life!"

Our great teacher, Chairman Mao, recently pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the revolutionary people under its leadership and the Kuomintang reactionaries. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." At this moment of celebrating the establishment of the Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, the soldiers of the troops stationed in Ningxia and the Ningxia Military Region, who have made outstanding contributions to the Cultural Revolution in Ningxia, study Chairman Mao's latest instructions over and over again, gaining a deeper understanding of the great significance of the Cultural Revolution. They express their determination to remember Chairman Mao's teachings, to constantly raise their consciousness of class struggle and line struggle, and to launch a continuous offensive against the class enemy. They say, the People's Liberation Army is a strong pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat, a steel wall defending our great motherland, and a powerful backing for the revolutionary committees. We must further strengthen our sense of enemy presence, heighten our revolutionary vigilance a hundredfold, oppose right opportunism, right opportunism of splitting, and right opportunism of capitulation, and together with the broad revolutionary masses, thoroughly smash all the plots and sabotage activities of the class enemy, using our blood and lives to defend Chairman Mao, to defend the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, to defend the newly born revolutionary committees, and to defend the borders of our motherland.

The military representatives participating in the various levels of revolutionary committees and the "three supports, two militaries" personnel, while celebrating the establishment of the Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the revolutionary committees, unanimously expressing their determination to bring into the revolutionary committees the fine tradition of the People's Liberation Army in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizing proletarian politics, adhering to the four firsts, and carrying forward the spirit of the May 7th directive. They will build the revolutionary committees into battle command posts that hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, are revolutionary, and are closely linked with the masses.

    我们伟大的导师毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”在欢庆自治区革命委员会成立的时刻，为宁夏无产阶级文化大革命作出卓越贡献的宁夏驻军和宁夏军区广大指战员，一遍又一遍地认真学习毛主席的这一最新指示，更加深刻地认识到无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义，他们表示一定要牢记毛主席的教导，不断提高阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，不停顿地向阶级敌人主动进攻。他们说，人民解放军是无产阶级专政的坚强柱石，是保卫伟大祖国的钢铁长城，是革命委员会的强大后盾。我们一定要进一步增强敌情观念，百倍提高革命警惕，反对右倾保守主义、右倾分裂主义和右倾投降主义，同广大革命群众一起，彻底粉碎阶级敌人的一切阴谋破坏活动，用鲜血和生命保卫毛主席，保卫以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，保卫新诞生的革命委员会，保卫祖国的边疆。
    参加各级革命委员会的部队代表和“三支”“两军”人员，在庆祝自治区革命委员会成立的时候，反复学习了毛主席关于革命委员会的最新指示，一致表示要把人民解放军活学活用毛泽东思想，突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风的优良传统带进革命委员会，把革命委员会建设成为高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的、革命化的、联系群众的战斗指挥部。
