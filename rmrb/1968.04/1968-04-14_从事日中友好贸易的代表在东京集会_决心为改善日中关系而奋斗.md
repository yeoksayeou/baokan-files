Representatives engaged in Japan-China friendly trade met in Tokyo on the 9th, expressing their determination to work for the improvement of Japan-China relations. According to a report by Xinhua News Agency, the Oriental News Agency reported that 500 representatives involved in Japan-China friendly trade gathered in Tokyo on the 9th. They opposed U.S. imperialist aggression in Vietnam, demanded the overthrow of the Sato government, and expressed their resolve to strive for the improvement of Japan-China relations.

The meeting passed a declaration stating that the failure of the Vietnam War and the dollar crisis have left U.S. imperialism in a state of panic. This is a great opportunity for the Japanese people to intensify their struggle for national independence.

The declaration demands that U.S. imperialism withdraw its troops and military bases from Japan and the entire Asia, that the traitorous Sato Eisaku step down, and that the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and the "treaty" between Japan and the Kuomintang bandits occupying Taiwan be abolished.

In his speech, Shiihara Teiji, Director of the Japan External Trade Organization, pointed out that as long as the struggle of the Japanese people against U.S. imperialism and for national independence is closely linked with the cause of Japan-China friendship and trade, Japan-China friendship and trade will definitely develop.

    据新华社讯　据东方通讯社报道：从事日中友好贸易的代表五百人，九日在东京集会，反对美帝侵略越南，要求打倒佐藤政府，并表示要为改善日中关系而奋斗。
    大会通过宣言指出，侵略越南战争的失败和美元危机，使美帝国主义焦头烂额。这是日本人民加紧进行争取民族独立斗争的大好时机。
    宣言要求美帝从日本和整个亚洲撤走它的侵略军队和军事基地，要求祸国殃民的佐藤荣作下台，并废除日美“安全条约”，废除日本同盘踞在台湾的蒋匪帮缔结的“条约”。
    日本国际贸易促进协会专务理事椥原定司在会上讲话指出，只要同日本人民的反美爱国正义斗争紧密地结合起来，日中友好和日中贸易就一定能够得到发展。
