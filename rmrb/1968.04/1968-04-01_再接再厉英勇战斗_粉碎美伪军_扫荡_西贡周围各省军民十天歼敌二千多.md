The New China News Agency reported from Hanoi on March 31 that according to the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, the guerrilla forces and local units in the provinces surrounding Saigon, including Long An, Gia Dinh, Thu Duc, Bien Hoa, and Tien Giang, launched continuous counterattacks against the "sweeping operations" directed by the defeated general Westmoreland from March 10 to 20. They annihilated more than 2,000 American and puppet troops, destroying or damaging 118 tanks and armored vehicles.

The report said that after the military and civilian forces in the Saigon-Gia Dinh area and its surrounding regions launched a powerful offensive against the enemy from late January to early March, the American and puppet forces in the Southeast region were extremely panicked. The enemy hastily concentrated all the main forces of the American and puppet troops in the Southeast region to the Saigon-Gia Dinh area and its surroundings to fend off the attacks, attempting to relieve their stronghold in Saigon.

Starting from March 11, the American and puppet forces began to advance towards their bases, but immediately encountered fierce resistance from the local guerrilla forces and local units.

In Long An Province, on March 12, the guerrilla forces and local units in the districts of Duc Hoa and Duc Hue ambushed the puppet army's 25th Division, which was advancing under the cover of 50 American tanks and armored vehicles. They annihilated more than 200 enemy troops, destroying or damaging 24 tanks and armored vehicles. On the 15th, the guerrilla forces in these two districts ambushed another enemy force, eliminating more than 160 American and puppet troops, and destroying or damaging 16 tanks and armored vehicles. On the 16th, three puppet army regiments, under the cover of an American independent armored brigade, again advanced towards Duc Hoa district. The local units and guerrilla forces in the two districts fought bravely and relentlessly, killing or wounding more than 200 enemy troops, destroying or damaging 18 tanks and armored vehicles, and shooting down six helicopters.

The puppet army suffered consecutive defeats, and the desperate American aggressors were forced to take personal command. On the 20th, a battalion of the American 25th Infantry Division replaced the puppet army and again advanced towards Duc Hoa district. However, they were similarly met with fierce resistance from the guerrilla forces, resulting in the annihilation of 120 enemy troops and the destruction of 15 armored vehicles.

In Gia Dinh Province, the guerrilla forces and local units in the districts of Ho Chi Minh, Go Vap, Phu Nhuan, and Cu Chi also launched continuous attacks on the American and puppet army bases, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. From March 13 to 20, they annihilated 350 American and puppet troops, destroyed 15 tanks and armored vehicles, and shot down three helicopters.

The guerrilla forces and local units in Thu Duc Province and Bien Hoa Province, from March 14 to 17, attacked the base of the American 199th Light Infantry Brigade in the Chau Doc area and ambushed the enemy in the surroundings of Thu Duc City, Chau Thanh, and Tan Uyen County. They annihilated 665 enemy troops, including 465 American soldiers, and destroyed 30 tanks and armored vehicles.

In Tien Giang Province, on the night of March 10, the People's Liberation Armed Forces launched a fierce attack on the base of the American 25th Infantry Division, which had just been deployed north of Chau Duc County. The People's Liberation Armed Forces, with a fierce assault, annihilated nearly 300 American troops and destroyed five cannons. On the 13th, a battalion of invading American troops advancing towards the Bau Le area was annihilated by the local units, with more than 100 enemy troops eliminated.

    再接再厉英勇战斗  粉碎美伪军“扫荡”
    西贡周围各省军民十天歼敌二千多
    新华社河内三十一日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方西贡周围的隆安、嘉定、土龙木、边和与西宁省的游击队和地方部队，在三月十日到二十日期间，接连反击由败将威斯特摩兰亲自指挥的“扫荡”，歼灭美伪军二千多名，击毁、击伤坦克和装甲车一百一十八辆。
    报道说，西贡—嘉定地区及其周围地区军民在一月底到三月初连续向敌人发动强大攻势之后，南部东区的美伪军极度惊惶。敌人慌忙地把南部东区的美伪军全部主力部队集中到西贡—嘉定地区周围来进行招架，妄图为他们的老巢西贡解围。
    从三月十一日起，美伪军开始向他们的驻地周围进犯，但是立即遭到当地游击队和地方部队的迎头痛击。
    在隆安省，三月十二日，德和、德惠两县游击队和地方部队截击在五十辆美国坦克和装甲车掩护下进犯的伪军第二十五师的军队，歼灭敌人二百多名，击毁、击伤坦克和装甲车二十四辆。十五日，这两县游击队又截击另一股敌人，消灭美伪军一百六十多名，击毁、击伤坦克和装甲车十六辆。十六日，伪军三个营在美国一个独立装甲团的掩护下，又向德和县进犯。上述两县地方部队和游击队再接再厉，英勇战斗，打死打伤敌人二百多名，击毁、击伤坦克和装甲车十八辆，击落直升飞机六架。
    伪军接连被打得一败涂地，气急败坏的美国强盗被迫亲自出马。二十日，美国第二十五步兵师的一个营取代伪军再次向德和县进犯。但同样遭到游击队的痛击，被消灭一百二十名，装甲车十五辆被击毁。
    在嘉定省，霍门、鹅邑、平新、古芝等县游击队和地方部队，也接连向美伪军驻地发动进攻，给敌人造成严重损失。在三月十三日到二十日期间，歼灭美伪军三百五十名，击毁坦克、装甲车十五辆，击落直升飞机三架。
    土龙木省和边和省游击队和地方部队，在三月十四日到十七日期间，在庄崩地区袭击美国第一九九轻步兵旅驻地，并在土龙木市、周城和新渊县城周围截击敌人，歼敌六百六十五名，其中包括美军四百六十五名，击毁坦克、装甲车三十辆。
    在西宁省，三月十日夜里，人民解放武装力量向刚刚调到盏盘县城北面的美国第二十五步兵师的驻地发动猛烈袭击。人民解放武装力量一阵猛打猛冲，就歼灭美军近三百名，击毁大炮五门。十三日，一营进犯保寨地区的美国侵略军，被当地地方部队歼灭一百多名。
