Members of the Tianjin Cotton Textile Factory Revolutionary Committee Remember Chairman Mao's Instructions and Participate in Collective Production Labor to Stay Close to the Masses

Walk out of the office, go to the workers, learn from the workers, and focus on the revolutionization of one's own thoughts to seize power and use it for the proletariat.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Tianjin on March 31, from the leaders of the Revolutionary Committee to the cadres of various departments in the Tianjin Cotton Textile Factory, they often participate in collective production labor, basically achieving half of their time for work and half for labor. They have realized from practice that cadres must walk out of the office, go to the production site, go to the workers, and in the process of working and learning together with the workers, focus on the revolutionization of their own thoughts. Only in this way can they not forget the nature of the working people, not forget the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions, not forget class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, seize power for the proletariat and use it well, and keep the revolutionary spirit forever.

The Revolutionary Committee of this factory was established in April last year. At that time, the members of the Revolutionary Committee were full of enthusiasm to reform the factory's unreasonable management system and old institutions, and had already merged the fourteen departments of the entire factory into three offices: revolution, production, and life. However, because they did not focus on the revolutionization of the cadres' thoughts, gradually some bad tendencies began to appear among the cadres: those who sat in the office increased, those who went deep into the masses decreased; those who went to the workshops to inspect increased, those who participated in production labor decreased; those who wore clean clothes increased, those who wore work clothes decreased. The masses had opinions about this. Several workers posted a big-character poster criticizing the leaders of the Revolutionary Committee for being detached from the masses.

The criticism from the masses caused a great shock to the Revolutionary Committee and the cadres. With the help of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed in the factory, they re-studied Chairman Mao's "Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and the five criteria for the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. While studying, they compared and checked themselves, and everyone was surprised. For example, the Revolutionary Committee was originally set up in a small room. This room was originally the headquarters of the earliest revolutionary group that broke through the white terror of the bourgeois reactionary line in this factory. Workers would come here after work to discuss the major issues of the factory's revolution and production with the leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations. However, soon after the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, they found this room too small and moved to the office of the factory headquarters, becoming "regularized," with fifteen full-time cadres. Since then, workers rarely came to the Revolutionary Committee. When the facts were laid out, many people were deeply moved. They said: Even if the phenomenon of being detached from the masses and labor has just emerged, if we do not plug these ideological loopholes in time, the poison of revisionism will take advantage of the situation. We must not seize the seal but lose the hammer. No matter how our position changes, the nature of the working class must never change.

The members of the factory Revolutionary Committee and the office cadres studied Chairman Mao's instructions: "We must insist on the system of cadres participating in collective production labor. Our party and state cadres are ordinary laborers, not lords sitting on the heads of the people. Cadres, through participating in collective production labor, maintain the broadest, most frequent, and closest contact with the working people. This is a fundamental matter in the socialist system, which helps to overcome bureaucratism, prevent revisionism and dogmatism." They said that to achieve the revolutionization of thoughts, one must start with participating in labor. Therefore, they all took "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with them, walked out of the office, and went to the production front line to work and fight against selfishness and revisionism together with the workers. The leaders of the factory Revolutionary Committee went to the dirtiest and most labor-intensive soft hemp and hemp splitting processes, the production office cadres went to the spinning workshop where they could best understand the production situation of the entire factory, the life office cadres went to the canteen and nursery, and the supply and marketing cadres went to the warehouse. They respectively took these places as their "base," both as a "base" for participating in collective production labor and as a "base" for promoting revolution and production; both as a "base" for contacting the masses and as a "base" for transforming their own thoughts. The Revolutionary Committee moved back to the original small room from the factory headquarters office, and the number of full-time cadres was reduced from fifteen to three. The workers welcomed the revolutionary actions of the cadres. They said that cadres walking out of the office, participating in production labor on the front line, promoting revolution and production, is the true path of combining with the workers, the path of the revolutionization of cadres' thoughts, and the path of implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

In the "base," the cadres honestly became students of the workers, learned from the workers, and their thoughts and feelings changed significantly. A cadre who graduated from the textile engineering department of a university originally thought that she knew more and was more "proficient" than the workers. When she worked with the workers and learned from them, she truly understood the truth of Chairman Mao's saying that "many so-called intellectuals are actually the least knowledgeable, and sometimes the workers and peasants know more." Many cadres, wearing work clothes and with their hands covered in oil, worked with the workers and deeply understood the excellent qualities of the working class. They said that workers listen to Chairman Mao the most, are the most loyal to him, and use Mao Zedong Thought the best. Learning from the workers first means learning their noble qualities. At the same time, while participating in production labor, the cadres became familiar with the production situation, grasped the problems in production, understood the opinions of the workers, and had Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, so they had the correct methods to solve problems and solved them in a timely manner. The workers were very satisfied with this.

Because the cadres insisted on participating in production labor, the relationship between the cadres and the masses in this factory became closer, and the cadres and workers united as one to make the revolution and production booming. In the first quarter of this year, the production level of the entire factory increased month by month.

### 天津市麻纺织厂革委会成员牢记毛主席教导  参加集体生产劳动密切联系群众

    天津市麻纺织厂革委会成员牢记毛主席教导
    参加集体生产劳动密切联系群众
    走出办公室，到工人中去，拜工人为师，狠抓自己的思想革命化，为无产阶级掌好权用好权
    据新华社天津三十一日电　天津市麻纺织厂从革命委员会的负责人到各部门的干部，经常参加集体生产劳动，基本上做到了一半时间工作，一半时间劳动。他们从实践中体会到：干部走出办公室，到生产中去，到工人中去，在同工人共同劳动、共同学习中，狠抓自己的思想革命化，才能不忘劳动人民的本色，不忘伟大领袖毛主席的教导，不忘阶级斗争和两条路线的斗争，为无产阶级掌好权用好权，永葆革命的青春。
    这个厂的革命委员会是在去年四月份建立的。当时，革命委员会成员满腔热情地要改革工厂的不合理管理体制和旧制度，并且已把全厂十四个科室合并成了革命、生产和生活三个办公室。但是，因为没有狠抓干部的思想革命化，渐渐地在干部中开始出现了一些不好的苗头：坐办公室的多了，深入群众的少了；到车间里转转的多了，参加生产劳动的少了；穿干干净净衣服的多了，穿工作服的少了。群众对此有意见。几个工人给他们贴了一张大字报，批评革命委员会的负责人脱离群众。
    群众的批评，引起了革命委员会和干部们很大的震动。他们在驻厂的解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，重新学习了毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》、《为人民服务》和关于无产阶级革命事业接班人五项标准，边学习，边对照，边检查，大家大吃一惊。例如，革命委员会原来设在一间小屋里，这间屋原来是这个厂最早从资产阶级反动路线白色恐怖中冲杀出来的造反大队的队部，工人们下班后都愿意到这里来，同革命群众组织的负责人一起议论全厂革命和生产的大事。可是，革命委员会建立不久，就嫌这间屋子小，搬到了厂部的办公室里，“正规化”起来了，脱产的干部达到十五个人。从此，工人们就很少到革命委员会来了。事情一摆，很多人感触很深。他们说：别看脱离群众、脱离劳动的现象才露头，但是，如果不及时堵上这些思想上的窟窿，修正主义的毒素，就会乘虚而入。我们决不能掌了印把子丢了锤把子。不管地位怎么变，工人阶级的本色永远不能变。
    厂革委会成员和办公室干部学习了毛主席的教导：“必须坚持干部参加集体生产劳动的制度。我们党和国家的干部是普通劳动者，而不是骑在人民头上的老爷。干部通过参加集体生产劳动，同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系。这是社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事，它有助于克服官僚主义，防止修正主义和教条主义。”他们说，要实现思想革命化，必须从参加劳动做起。于是，他们纷纷带着《毛主席语录》，走出办公室，到生产第一线去，同工人一起劳动，一起斗私批修。厂革命委员会的负责人到最脏、最累的软麻工序和劈麻工序去，生产办公室的干部到最便于了解全厂生产情况的梳纺车间去，生活办公室的干部到食堂和托儿所去，供销干部到仓库去。他们分别把这些地方作为自己的“基地”，既作为参加集体生产劳动的“基地”，又作为抓革命、促生产的“基地”；既作为联系群众的“基地”，又作为改造自己思想的“基地”。革命委员会又从厂部办公室搬回了原来那间小屋，脱产干部从十五人减少到三人。工人们对干部的这一革命行动，十分欢迎。他们说，干部走出办公室，参加生产劳动到第一线，抓革命、促生产，这是真正同工人相结合的道路，是干部思想革命化的道路，也是贯彻执行毛主席无产阶级革命路线的道路。
    干部们在“基地”里，老老实实地当工人的学生，拜工人为师，思想感情起了显著的变化。一个在大学纺织工程系毕业的干部，原来总觉得自己懂得的知识多，比工人“高明”。当她同工人一起劳动，拜工人为师以后，才真正懂得了毛主席说的“许多所谓知识分子，其实是比较地最无知识的，工农分子的知识有时倒比他们多一点”的教导，是千真万确的真理。很多干部身穿工作服，两手沾满油污，同工人一起劳动，更深刻地认识了工人阶级的优秀品质。他们说，工人最听毛主席的话，对毛主席最忠，对毛泽东思想用得最好。拜工人为师，首先就要学习他们这种高贵品质。同时，干部们在参加生产劳动的过程中，熟悉了生产情况，掌握了生产中的问题，了解了工人的意见，又有了毛泽东思想作武器，解决问题时就有了正确的办法，而且解决得及时。工人们对此很满意。
    由于干部坚持参加生产劳动，这个厂的干群关系密切了，干部和工人团结一致，把革命和生产搞得热气腾腾。今年第一季度，全厂的生产水平逐月提高。
