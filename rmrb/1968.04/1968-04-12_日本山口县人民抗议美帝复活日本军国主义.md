The revolutionary people and patriots of Yamaguchi Prefecture in Japan held a rally and demonstration on April 7 in Hōfu City to protest against U.S. imperialism's efforts to revive Japanese militarism. They bravely fought against the Japanese reactionary "Self-Defense Forces" and fully armed police who came to suppress them.

Hōfu City is the base of the "Self-Defense Forces." In the afternoon of April 7, more than 600 revolutionary people and patriots of Yamaguchi Prefecture held a protest rally here. The participants unanimously denounced U.S. imperialism for intensifying its efforts to revive Japanese militarism and turn Japan into a base for anti-communism, anti-China, and aggression against Asia.

Representative Yumiya Haruo of the Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee (Left) of the Japanese Communist Party spoke at the meeting. He pointed out that the current world situation is excellent. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has achieved brilliant victories. The Vietnamese people's war of resistance against U.S. aggression for national salvation has driven U.S. imperialism into a state of disarray. The revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are thriving. The flames of the black people's struggle against violence in the United States are burning fiercely. U.S. imperialism has fallen into a desperate situation and is making its last struggles.

Yumiya strongly condemned U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism for colluding to play the "peace talk" trick on the Vietnamese issue. He also condemned the Sato reactionary government of Japan and the Japanese Communist Party revisionist clique for actively serving U.S. imperialism's "peace talk" trick.

Yumiya pointed out that the facts have proven that to oppose U.S. imperialism, one must also oppose modern revisionism.

Yumiya finally called on the participants to further study Mao Zedong Thought, unite with more people, and strive to smash all the tricks of U.S. imperialism, the Japanese reactionaries, the Soviet revisionist clique, and the Miyamoto clique.

Representatives of the Japanese Socialist Party, the Yamaguchi Prefecture Branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox), and representatives from various places also spoke at the meeting.

After the meeting, the crowd, holding high portraits of Chairman Mao and placards with quotations from Chairman Mao, as well as many banners, marched and demonstrated in a spirited manner.

The anti-U.S. patriotic actions of the demonstrators received strong support from the people of Hōfu City.

The Sato reactionary government of Japan was frightened by the revolutionary actions of the demonstrators and mobilized a large number of fully armed "Self-Defense Forces" and police to suppress them, and organized thugs to cause trouble. The demonstrators bravely fought back.

During the demonstration on April 7, the Japanese police authorities illegally arrested six revolutionary masses. The demonstrators strongly protested against the illegal arrests by the Japanese police authorities in front of the Hōfu "Police Station." They opened the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in front of hundreds of fully armed police and read aloud: "All the reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality, they are not so powerful. As we all know, the various reactionaries always bluster, and as soon as people oppose them, they reveal their original features and turn tail and run. All the reactionaries are paper tigers. In essence, they are reactionaries who oppress the people. They can only be like paper tigers. The people, armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, have sharp eyes; they can see through the reactionaries' tricks and penetrate through the reactionaries' deception. The people have organized, they have fought back against the reactionaries, and the reactionaries are bound to collapse. All the reactionaries are paper tigers. The theory has been proven correct in its application in China, and it will be proven correct in its application throughout the world." (with photo)

    日共山口县委（左派）代表号召坚决粉碎美日反动派、苏修和宫本集团的一切阴谋
    新华社东京电　日本山口县革命人民和爱国人士七日在防府市举行集会和示威，抗议美帝国主义加紧复活日本军国主义。他们同前来镇压的日本反动派的“自卫队”和全副武装的警察进行了英勇的搏斗。
    防府市设有“自卫队”的基地。七日下午，山口县革命人民和爱国人士六百多人，在这里举行抗议集会。参加大会的群众一致声讨美帝国主义加紧复活日本军国主义，把日本变为反共、反华和侵略亚洲的基地。
    日共山口县委（左派）代表影山春雄在讲话时指出，当前世界形势大好。毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命取得了辉煌胜利，越南人民的抗美救国战争把美帝国主义打得焦头烂额，亚非拉人民的革命斗争正在蓬勃发展，美国国内黑人抗暴斗争的烽火正在熊熊燃烧，美帝国主义已经陷于绝境，正在作垂死挣扎。
    影山强烈谴责美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义勾结起来，在越南问题上加紧玩弄“和谈”阴谋。他还谴责日本佐藤反动政府和日共修正主义集团积极为美帝国主义的“和谈”阴谋效劳。
    影山指出，事实证明，要反对美帝国主义，就必须反对现代修正主义。
    影山最后号召与会者进一步努力学习毛泽东思想，团结更加广泛的人民，为粉碎美帝国主义、日本反动派、苏修集团和宫本集团的一切阴谋而奋斗到底。
    日本社会党代表、日中友好协会（正统）山口县总部代表和各地代表也在会上讲了话。
    大会结束后，群众高举毛主席的画像和毛主席语录牌以及许多标语牌，雄赳赳，气昂昂地举行了游行示威。
    示威群众的反美爱国行动，得到了防府市民的大力支持。
    日本佐藤反动政府被示威群众的革命行动吓破了胆，调动了大批全副武装的“自卫队”和警察前来进行镇压，并组织暴徒进行破坏。示威的群众进行了英勇的反击。
    在七日游行示威中，日本警察当局无理逮捕了六名革命群众。示威群众在防府“警察署”前，强烈抗议日本警察当局的非法逮捕。他们在几百个全副武装警察面前，翻开《毛主席语录》高声朗读：“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”（附图片）
