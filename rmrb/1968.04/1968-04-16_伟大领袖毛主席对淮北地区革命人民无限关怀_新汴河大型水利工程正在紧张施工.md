The large-scale water conservancy project to control the waterlogging disasters in Anhui's Huabei Plain—the New Samen River excavation project—is currently under intense construction. Along the more than 130-kilometer-long construction site, red flags are flying, and the air is filled with songs. Inside and outside the temporary shelters and at the construction sites, Chairman Mao's portraits and quotations are everywhere. Over 200,000 workers and cadres, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, are studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything on the construction site. They are determined to turn the New Samen River construction site into a vibrant Mao Zedong Thought school.

The New Samen River project is a new large-scale canal project on the Huai River Plain. The Huabei region is low-lying, with many rivers, but the riverbeds are shallow and narrow. Therefore, when heavy rains occur, the upstream floodwaters quickly surge, raising the water level and preventing the internal waters from being discharged, resulting in extensive agricultural lands on both sides suffering from floods. The excavation of the New Samen River will timely divert the upstream floodwaters into Hongze Lake, reducing the burden on the downstream rivers and ensuring the timely discharge of internal waters. This is a key project for controlling the waterlogging disasters in the Huabei region. It is estimated that after the completion of this project, along with other corresponding projects, 10 million mu of farmland in Anhui's Su County will benefit, and 5 million mu of farmland in related areas of Henan and Jiangsu will also benefit.

The designed length of the New Samen River, starting from the north of Su County City and diverting from the Tuo River, passing through Lingbi, Sizhou, and Suhong in Jiangsu, and then entering Hongze Lake, is 127 kilometers long. Including the diversion channel, the total length is 135.8 kilometers. The entire project began construction in October 1966. The second phase of the project is currently underway.

The planning and design of the New Samen River project have implemented the great leader Chairman Mao's strategic line of "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people," embodying Chairman Mao's infinite concern for the revolutionary people of the Huabei region. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the Huabei region have earnestly implemented Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production" in the construction of this project.

The broad masses of workers, with deep proletarian feelings of boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty towards Chairman Mao, are studying Chairman Mao's works on the construction site and setting up various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They are determined to use Mao Zedong Thought to guide the construction and use Mao Zedong Thought to transform their worldview. They are fighting against the "self" in their minds and criticizing the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Anhui who attempt to restore capitalism in the countryside, criticizing their revisionist water control line and counter-revolutionary economism. This has strongly promoted the revolution and construction. During the construction process, the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Su County has done a lot of work in vigorously promoting Mao Zedong Thought and assisting workers in setting up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, which has been warmly welcomed by the workers.

    伟大领袖毛主席对淮北地区革命人民无限关怀
    新汴河大型水利工程正在紧张施工
    据新华社合肥十五日电根治安徽淮北平原内涝灾害的一项大型水利工程——新汴河开挖工程，目前正在紧张施工。在长达一百三十多公里的工地上，红旗招展，歌声震天。工棚内外和施工现场，到处是毛主席画像和毛主席语录牌。二十多万民工和干部在中国人民解放军的帮助下，活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想统帅工地上的一切，他们决心把新汴河工地办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    新汴河工程是淮河平原一项大型的新开挖的河道工程。淮北地区地势低洼，这里河道虽多，但河床浅窄，因此一遇暴雨，上游洪水迅速袭来，水位抬高，大量内水无法排出，致使两岸大面积农田受到洪涝灾害。新汴河的开挖，将可及时引泄上游洪水进入洪泽湖，减轻下游河道的负担，保证内水及时排出。这是根治淮北地区洪涝灾害的一项关键性工程。预计这项工程完成后，配合其他相应的工程，安徽宿县地区受益农田即达一千万亩，河南、江苏有关地区也将有五百万亩农田受益。
    新汴河的设计长度，从宿县城北截引沱河起，经灵璧、泗县及江苏的泗洪，然后入洪泽湖，长达一百二十七公里，加上引河部分共长一百三十五点八公里。整个工程是在一九六六年十月开始兴建的。现在进行的是第二期工程。
    新汴河工程的规划设计，贯彻了伟大领袖毛主席的“备战、备荒、为人民”的战略方针，体现了伟大领袖毛主席对淮北地区革命人民的无限关怀。淮北地区的广大贫下中农和革命干部，在这项工程的施工中认真贯彻了毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针。
    广大民工怀着对毛主席的无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的深厚的无产阶级感情，在工地上大学毛主席著作，大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，决心用毛泽东思想统帅施工，用毛泽东思想改造自己的世界观。他们以“斗私，批修”为纲，一方面狠斗自己头脑中的“私”字，一方面批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其在安徽的代理人妄图在农村复辟资本主义的罪行，批判他们推行的修正主义治水路线和反革命经济主义，有力地推动了革命和施工。在施工过程中，中国人民解放军驻宿县地区部队毛泽东思想宣传队，在大力开展宣传毛泽东思想、协助民工开办毛泽东思想学习班方面，作了大量的工作，受到了民工的热烈欢迎。
