Under the rule of the Soviet revisionist leadership, a small clique of privileged class elements ruthlessly oppress and exploit the working people in factories, mines, and farms. These privileged class elements act arbitrarily towards workers, extort money, arbitrarily deduct workers' wages, dismiss workers at will, and even carry out political persecution. The basic living rights and personal safety of the broad masses of workers are not guaranteed.

According to Soviet revisionist publications, many working people in Leningrad City and Leningrad Province are often unjustly dismissed. The phenomenon of dismissing "youth, pregnant women, and women with infants under one year old" is also common.

A leader of a road construction machinery station dismissed 79 out of 190 workers without reason in just one year. A female worker at the Makhachkala Machine Manufacturing Plant was fired by the factory director for resisting his suppression and persecution of workers, on the grounds of "disobeying the director's direct instructions."

The manager of a barbershop in Kishinyov acts as if he is in a hereditary fiefdom, issuing orders at will. He prioritizes the production of fake braids and keeps the money from selling them. "He collects special rent from the barbers, extorts money from them to pay for fines imposed by the sanitary-epidemiological station, fuel purchases, electrical repairs, underground drainage, laundry expenses, and even his drinking expenses."

Gazalov, the head of the Beslan Sawmill under the North Ossetian Autonomous Republic's Department of Agriculture, under the protection of his superiors, "can arbitrarily issue warnings to workers and reduce their wages for one or two months. Anything can be a reason for him to punish workers."

Once, Gazalov conspired with his henchmen to persecute two workers, but failed due to the workers' resistance. He then sought help from the "police station." The police immediately sent officers to "assist" Gazalov. The police first took away the carpenter Brolin from the workshop, and later arrested three more workers. Other workers, out of indignation, questioned the police chief, but the police chief shamelessly sided with the oppressors, saying: "The authority of the leaders must be maintained."

The police station fabricated charges against the three arrested workers, threatened and harassed them, and unreasonably searched their homes. Meanwhile, Gazalov, under the protection of the deputy minister of agriculture of the autonomous republic, Tamayev, the district party committee, the police station, and the judicial authorities, continued to act arbitrarily and oppress the workers with impunity.

    在苏修资产阶级专政下
    特权阶层胡作非为任意欺压劳动人民
    在苏修领导集团的统治下，一小撮特权阶层分子在工矿企业和农场中残酷压迫和剥削劳动人民。特权阶层分子对工人蛮横专断，敲诈勒索，动辄克扣工人工资，任意解雇工人，甚至进行政治迫害。广大职工起码的生活权利和人身安全都得不到保障。
    据苏修报刊透露，列宁格勒市和列宁格勒州的许多劳动人民经常被无理解雇。“少年、孕妇以及抚养周岁以下婴儿的女工”被解雇的现象更是常见的。
    一个修路机械站的领导人仅在一年中，竟把在这个站工作的一百九十个工作人员中的七十九人无故解职。马哈赤塔拉机器制造厂的女工作人员因为抵制厂长压制、迫害工人的行为，结果被厂长以违背厂长“直接指示”的罪名开除出工厂。
    基什尼奥夫一家理发馆经理在理发馆里“好象在世袭领地内一样可以发号施令。他把生产假辫子作为第一件事，而推销辫子所得的钱却据为己有”。“他向理发师收特殊的代役租，从他们那儿勒索钱来偿付卫生防疫站加给理发馆的罚款、购买汽油费、修理电气用具和地下水道，偿付洗衣服方面的开支，甚至一直到他喝酒的费用。”
    北奥塞夏自治共和国农业部所属的贝斯兰市锯木制材厂负责人加扎洛夫，在上级的庇护下，“可以十分轻率地宣布给工人以警告，降低工人一、两个月的工资。什么事情都可以成为他对工人进行惩罚的理由”。
    有一次，加扎洛夫伙同他的爪牙阴谋迫害两个工人，但由于遭到工人们的抵制，没有得逞。于是他就向“警察局求助”。警察局马上派出警察去“帮助”加扎洛夫。警察到车间先把木工勃洛欣带走了，后来又抓走了三个工人。别的工人出于义愤，纷纷向民警局局长提出质问，但民警局局长却明目张胆为虎作伥。他说：“应该维持领导人的威信”。
    警察局给被逮捕的三个工人加上莫须有的罪名，百般进行威胁和刁难，并且无理到他们家中进行了搜查。而加扎洛夫却在自治共和国农业部副部长塔马耶夫、区党委、警察局和司法机关的庇护下，照样逍遥自在，胡作非为。
