Revolutionary criticism is the major direction of the struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Only by thoroughly carrying out revolutionary criticism can we politically, ideologically, and theoretically completely overthrow the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party headed by China's Khrushchev, consolidate and develop the great alliance of revolution, and consolidate the newly established revolutionary committees. Only by continuously and persistently carrying out revolutionary criticism can we continuously raise our class consciousness and consciousness of line struggle, continuously deepen our understanding of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and sweep away all obstacles on our path forward. The deeper the revolutionary criticism goes, the more we hate the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev, and the more we love Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Therefore, carrying out revolutionary criticism is a matter of utmost importance! Whether or not we grasp revolutionary criticism is a major issue of whether we have a class struggle consciousness, whether we emphasize proletarian politics, whether we can follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and whether we can fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. It is a major issue of whether we are loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The proletarian revolutionary masses must not relax revolutionary criticism.

We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of "beating fallen dogs," and strive to be critics, denouncing with both words and pen, fighting this "people's war" of revolutionary criticism. Closely combining it with the struggle, criticism, and reform of our own units, we must carry out revolutionary criticism thoroughly and persistently, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    搞好革命大批判巩固革命委员会
    革命的大批判，是无产阶级文化大革命斗争的大方向。只有深入地开展革命的大批判，才能从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派，巩固和发展革命的大联合，才能巩固新生的革命委员会。只有不间断地持久地开展革命大批判，才能不断提高我们的阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟，才能不断加深对毛主席一系列最新指示的理解，才能扫清我们前进道路上的重重障碍。革命大批判搞得越深入，对中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义路线越仇恨，对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线也就越热爱。所以，搞好革命的大批判是万分重要的大事！抓不抓革命大批判，是有没有阶级斗争观念，突不突出无产阶级政治，能不能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，能不能全面落实毛主席最新指示的重大问题，是忠不忠于毛主席，忠不忠于毛泽东思想，忠不忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的重大问题。无产阶级革命派万万不可放松革命的大批判。
    我们必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬痛打“落水狗”的彻底革命精神，人人争作批判家，个个口诛笔伐，打好这场革命大批判的“人民战争”，紧密结合本单位斗批改，把革命大批判深入持久地开展下去，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
