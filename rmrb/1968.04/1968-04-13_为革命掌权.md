	For the Revolution, Seize Power
	Yan Bingzi, Head of the Third Production Brigade, Nan Gunlong Valley Brigade, Ping Shan County, Hebei

	Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army led by the Communist Party are revolutionary armies. Our army is completely for the liberation of the people and works thoroughly for the people's interests." Being a cadre means serving the people, and one must do so "completely" and "thoroughly" with "wholehearted devotion to the people."

	However, the Chinese Khrushchev sings a different tune from Chairman Mao, saying: "Personal interests must be taken care of, without personal interests there can be no collective interests." And what's more, he shamelessly says: "It's not about being selfless, but about being self-interested." Pfft! This is pure nonsense. Falling for his tricks will lead one astray.

	Before the Cultural Revolution, there was a period when I had selfish thoughts. I thought: I've been a cadre for over a decade, working just as hard as anyone else, staying up just as late, but I don't earn any more work points. What's more, I might offend people. The more I feared offending people, the more I felt that being a cadre was a losing proposition. I wanted to throw in the towel. When others tried to reason with me, I wouldn't listen, thinking they didn't know the hardships of being a cadre.

	Last May, during a family study session at my daughter's request, I recalled the bitterness of the past and the sweetness of the present, and studied the "Three Articles." I realized that the thought of "being a cadre is a losing proposition" was completely wrong. Comrades Zhang Zhide and Norman Bethune gave their lives for the revolutionary cause, so why should I worry about whether being a cadre is a winning or losing proposition? Originally, Zhang Zhide and Norman Bethune had a "public" spirit in their minds, while I had a "selfish" spirit. With a "selfish" spirit, one forgets the past hardships and the revolutionary cause, only considering personal gains and losses.

	The brigade's party branch organized a Mao Zedong Thought study class to carry out revolutionary criticism, criticizing Chinese Khrushchev's "class struggle is extinguished" theory and "suffering a small loss for a big gain" and other fallacies, further raising my consciousness. I further realized that thinking being a cadre is a "loss" or "not beneficial" is falling for the poison spread by Chinese Khrushchev's "selfish" philosophy of "if you don't look out for yourself, heaven and earth will punish you," and falling for his "public with private interests" bourgeois selfishness. We grassroots cadres in the countryside must thoroughly purge the poison spread by Chinese Khrushchev and completely break the "being a cadre is a loss" theory.

	I also realized that being a cadre and fearing to offend people is also a manifestation of putting oneself first and being selfish. Our predecessors and martyrs were not afraid of losing their heads for the revolution, so why should I fear offending people? The more one fears offending people, the more one shrinks back and dares not work boldly. Not fearing to offend people is the way to dare to revolutionize and do a good job.

	Regarding "offending people," one must make a concrete analysis. If one has done wrong, others have objections, then one must start from the people's interests, examine and correct one's mistakes. If one has done right, the broad masses of community members who are wholeheartedly for the collective will support one. Those who oppose one are either class enemies or those with heavy selfish thoughts. For example, wealthy middle peasants with serious capitalist thoughts want to implement the "three independences and one contract," and cadres disagree, so they have objections to the cadres. This is a reflection of class struggle. In such a situation, if one fears offending these people and agrees to let them implement the "three independences and one contract," it is allowing capitalism to spread and making the poor and lower-middle peasants suffer. If it develops, it will make thousands and millions of people lose their heads. Therefore, this is not a matter of offending people, but a major issue of upholding the proletarian standpoint and the socialist direction. On major issues of principle, one must have a firm stand and clear attitude, not fearing to offend people. Only in this way can one be a good cadre.

	Through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I deeply understand that the fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of power. Without power, we poor and lower-middle peasants have nothing. We must carry on the revolutionary criticism persistently, purging the poison spread by Chinese Khrushchev.

    为革命掌权
    河北平山县南滚龙沟大队第三生产队队长　阎炳子
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“我们的共产党和共产党所领导的八路军、新四军，是革命的队伍。我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”当干部，就是为人民服务，就得做到“完全”、“彻底”地“全心全意地为人民服务”。
    可是，中国赫鲁晓夫同毛主席大唱反调，说什么：“个人利益一定要照顾，没有个人利益即无整体利益。”这还不算，他还露骨地说：“不是大公无私，而是大公有私。”呸！这纯粹是骗人的鬼话。上了他的当，就会走上邪路。
    文化大革命以前，有一段时间，我有私心。我想：自己当了十几年的干部，活一点也不比别人少干，夜一点也不比别人少熬，可工分一点也不比别人多挣。闹不好，还得罪人。越怕得罪人，就越觉得当干部没有“落头”，我就想撂下挑子不干。别人给我做思想工作，我怎么也听不进去，还认为别人是：不当家不知道柴米贵，不当干部不知道当干部的难处。
    去年五月，在一次家庭学习会上，在女儿的要求下，我进行了忆苦思甜，又学习了“老三篇”，我认识到，“当干部不上算”的思想是完全错误的。张思德、白求恩同志，为了革命事业，连自己的生命都贡献出来了，可我为什么要计较当干部上算不上算呢？原来，张思德、白求恩的头脑里，装有一个“公”字，而我的头脑里，却装着一个“私”字。有了“私”字，就忘记了过去的苦，就忘记了革命事业，光考虑个人的得失。
    大队党支部举办的毛泽东思想学习班开展革命的大批判，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论、“吃小亏占大便宜”等谬论，更加提高了我的觉悟。我进一步认识到：认为当干部“吃亏”、
  “不得利”，是中了中国赫鲁晓夫宣扬的“人不为己，天诛地灭”的唯私哲学的流毒，是上了他的“大公有私”的资产阶级利己主义的当。我们农村基层干部，必须彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫的流毒，大破“当干部吃亏”论。
    我还认识到，当干部怕得罪人，也是从个人出发，“私”字当头的表现。前辈先烈为革命不怕丢脑袋，我还怕得罪人？越怕得罪人，就越是缩手缩脚，不敢大胆地进行工作。不怕得罪人，才能敢于革命，把工作做好。
    对于“得罪人”，要作具体分析。自己作错了事，别人有意见，就要从人民的利益出发，检讨和改正自己的错误。自己作对了，一心为集体的广大社员，总是拥护的。那些反对自己的人，不是阶级敌人，就是自私心很重的人。比如，资本主义思想严重的富裕中农，想搞“三自一包”，干部不同意，他们就对干部有意见。这就是阶级斗争的反映。在这种情况下，如果怕得罪这些人，同意他们搞“三自一包”，就是让资本主义泛滥，让贫下中农倒霉。发展下去，就会让千百万人头落地。所以，这不是什么得罪人的问题，而是坚持无产阶级立场、坚持社会主义方向的大问题。在大是大非的问题上，就要立场坚定、态度鲜明，不怕得罪人，这样，才是一个好干部。
    经过无产阶级文化大革命，我深深懂得，革命的根本问题是政权问题。没有政权就没有我们贫下中农的一切。我们一定要把革命的大批判持久地开展下去，肃清中国赫鲁晓夫所散布的流毒。
