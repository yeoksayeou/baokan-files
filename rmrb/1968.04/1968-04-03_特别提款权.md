The scheme for the so-called "Special Drawing Rights" established by the "International Monetary Fund" is a trick devised by American imperialism to deceive people. Its purpose is to patch up the current Western monetary system, which is centered around the dollar, without touching the privileged position of the dollar, in order to cope with the strong pressure from France and other Western European countries to thoroughly reform the current Western monetary system and abolish the privileged status of the dollar and pound as "reserve currencies."

The U.S. first proposed this scheme in November 1965. According to the U.S. design, the so-called "Special Drawing Rights" is a unit for settlement among member countries of the "International Monetary Fund." Each unit is equivalent to one dollar. They will be distributed according to the share each member country holds in the fund of this organization. The "Special Drawing Rights" received will serve as the reserves of member countries, which can be used to repay debts when there is a deficit in international payments. In other words, "Special Drawing Rights" are "paper gold" issued in large quantities by the "International Monetary Fund," which is manipulated by the U.S., in dollar units, standing alongside gold and dollars as Western international reserve and settlement means. Because the U.S. holds a large share in the "International Monetary Fund," this "paper gold" will directly help the U.S. to cover its international payments deficit. Moreover, according to the U.S. intention, this "paper gold" will also lay the foundation for establishing a new Western international monetary system in the future, which is detached from gold but still dominated by the dollar. The U.S. scheme for "Special Drawing Rights" has been strongly opposed by France.

    特别提款权
    由“国际货币基金组织”设立所谓“特别提款权”的方案，是美帝国主义挖空心思搞出来的骗人把戏，其目的是在不触动美元特权地位的前提下，对当前西方世界以美元为中心的货币制度修修补补，以应付法国等西欧国家一再要求彻底修改当前西方货币制度、取消美元英镑作为“储备货币”的特权地位的强大压力。
    美国的这套方案最初是在一九六五年十一月提出来的。按照美国的设计，所谓“特别提款权”是一种在“国际货币基金组织”成员国之间进行结算的单位，每个单位折合一美元。它们将按各成员国在这个组织的基金中所占份额进行分配；分到的“特别提款权”将作为成员国的储备，遇到国际收支出现逆差时可以用它来还债。换句话说，“特别提款权”就是由美国操纵的“国际货币基金组织”发行巨额的、以美元为单位的“纸面黄金”，同黄金和美元并列作为西方国际货币储备手段和清算手段；由于美国在“国际货币基金组织”中所占的份额大，这种“纸面黄金”将直接帮助美国弥补国际收支逆差。此外，按照美国的意图，这种“纸面黄金”还将为今后建立脱离黄金的、仍以美元为主体的新的西方国际货币体系创造基础。美国关于“特别提款权”的方案遭到法国强烈反对。　（据新华社）
