	Editor's Note: What should be done when new revolutionary committees encounter various shortcomings and mistakes in their work?

	The revolutionary workers of the Qiqihaer Vehicle Factory, with a great sense of responsibility as masters of the state, enthusiastically help the revolutionary committee overcome shortcomings and improve work. They sharply raise criticisms and sincerely hope that the members of the revolutionary committee will "never again walk the old path" and become leaders who are forever loyal to Chairman Mao, closely connected with the masses, and heart-to-heart with the people.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Any party, any individual, mistakes are inevitable. We demand fewer mistakes. If mistakes are made, we demand correction, the quicker and more thorough the correction, the better."

	The comrades of the Vehicle Factory Revolutionary Committee took the correct attitude after hearing the criticisms of the masses. They treated the criticisms of the masses as a driving force to change their style of work and improve their work. Thus, the revolutionary committee not only did not lower its prestige, but on the contrary, further established its proletarian authority among the masses.

	We hope that comrades of revolutionary committees at all levels and the broad revolutionary masses will, on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, establish a new relationship between cadres and the masses, so as to unite as one, jointly fight the enemy, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	According to a report from our newspaper, the revolutionary workers of the Qiqihaer Vehicle Factory in Heilongjiang Province, with the attitude of masters, enthusiastically help the factory revolutionary committee overcome shortcomings and improve work. The members of the factory revolutionary committee humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, rely on the supervision and help of the masses, and make the revolutionary committee truly a revolutionary and connected-to-the-masses battle command center.

	Since its establishment, the factory revolutionary committee, under the guidance of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of a certain unit of the PLA stationed in the factory, has vigorously implemented Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The entire factory has achieved revolutionary great unity by workshop and department, more than 95% of the cadres have come out to revolutionize, and more than 95% of the workers have participated in Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The revolutionary and production situation is excellent, and the proletarian revolutionary authority of the revolutionary committee has been gradually established in the struggle.

	However, some members of the revolutionary committee have gradually developed a sense of complacency, spending more time above ground and less time going deep into the masses; making more decisions themselves and less consultation with the masses; giving more orders and less concrete help. At the same time, due to the original set of overlapping structures that have not changed much, many members are confined to the office, busy with affairs, making phone calls, listening to reports, and unable to go deep into the masses.

	These phenomena have been seen by the revolutionary workers of the entire factory and are a source of concern. The revolutionary workers of the heavy machine workshop's large car class, in response to these phenomena, conducted thorough discussions and research. They said: The establishment of the revolutionary committee is only the beginning of a new long march. The road ahead is longer, the burden is heavier, and the responsibility is greater. Looking at the problems of the factory revolutionary committee and thinking about the lessons of the past when a small clique of capitalist roaders in the original factory committee implemented the revisionist line of managing the enterprise, we have the responsibility to help the revolutionary committee overcome shortcomings and improve work. The cadres of the factory revolutionary committee are our leaders, comrades, and class brothers. We must raise our opinions to them. We must tell them our true feelings. The entire class decided to send a big-character poster to the factory revolutionary committee.

	This big-character poster first affirmed the achievements made since the establishment of the revolutionary committee, and then sharply pointed out the problems existing in the revolutionary committee. Finally, it expressed the hope: "Revolutionary comrades, the lessons of the past are vivid, and the memory is still fresh. Do not walk the old path again. We workers do not want to see cadres making mistakes. Your mistakes will harm the revolutionary cause, and we are heartbroken. We want leaders who are forever loyal to Chairman Mao, deeply connected with the masses, and heart-to-heart with us. We do not want officials who do not leave their chairs, sit high above, and live by phone and reports."

	The comrades of the revolutionary committee heard that the workers of the large car class had sent a big-character poster and immediately, together with the staff, warmly received them. The workers of the large car class sincerely said: "Our opinions are not mature. We raise them for you to study together. If you think it is necessary, you can post this big-character poster."

	The comrades of the revolutionary committee were greatly moved after reading this big-character poster. They sincerely said to the comrades of the large car class: "This revolutionary big-character poster is excellent! Not only should we study it seriously, but we also hope that all revolutionary comrades in the factory will learn from you." They immediately posted this big-character poster in the most prominent place at the factory gate. The director of the factory revolutionary committee, Zhang Daokai, convened an expanded meeting of the standing committee that night to repeatedly study this big-character poster. Everyone unanimously agreed: This big-character poster fully reflects the deep class feelings of the proletarian revolutionary faction for the factory revolutionary committee, is the greatest help and care for the leading cadre, and points out the big issue of how the factory revolutionary committee will develop and grow healthily after its establishment. To mobilize the revolutionary masses more broadly to study and discuss, the factory revolutionary committee printed and distributed the big-character poster throughout the factory and made a resolution, calling on all revolutionary workers in the factory to learn from the large car class, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to do, and put forward criticisms and suggestions to the factory revolutionary committee, helping the revolutionary committee to overcome shortcomings and improve work.

	The attitude and actions of the factory revolutionary committee towards this big-character poster have caused a strong response throughout the factory. Many cadres said: "We must learn from the worker comrades and treat the criticisms of the workers as a driving force to change our style of work and improve our work." Many units under the factory revolutionary committee immediately dispatched personnel to strengthen the production front line according to the actual situation, and quickly had 30% of the staff go to the workshops and classes to work.

	Under the guidance of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of the PLA, the members of the factory revolutionary committee further studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "firmly adhering to the mass line, consulting with the masses on matters, and being a small student of the masses." Everyone realized: The struggle between the two lines, after all, is a struggle over the fundamental attitude towards the masses. Under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, power must be held by relying on the masses. Only by rooting in the masses, being a small student of the masses, and humbly listening to the opinions of the masses, can the leading cadre truly represent the masses in holding power, stand at the forefront of the movement, unite and lead the masses to fight against class enemies, and keep the revolutionary power forever red. Therefore, the standing committee of the revolutionary committee decided to open the door for rectification.

	During the rectification, the leading cadre of the factory further realized: The revolutionary committee is not something that falls from the sky. Its members inevitably bring some old habits and styles, more or less, into the revolutionary organization. If this problem is not recognized and the masses are not relied upon to clean out these muddy waters, the nature of the proletarian dictatorship will change. They fought against selfishness and deeply examined themselves for the tendency to detach from the masses to all revolutionary workers in the factory, and formulated systems for the members of the revolutionary committee and all cadres in the factory to participate in collective production labor, go to the workshops and classes to set up work points, etc. The members of the revolutionary committee also, together with the staff, formed a Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team to go deep into the workers and families to propagate Mao Zedong Thought. Three standing committee members led more than forty cadres to go to five workshops respectively, study and implement the measures to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions with the workers, and successively summarized the experiences of consolidating revolutionary great unity, liberating cadres, and running study classes, and held a meeting to promote them to the entire factory, which strongly promoted the movement in the factory. In this way, workers have heart-to-heart talks with cadres, and the masses have frank and open opinions to the leadership, forming a political situation that is both centralized and democratic, both disciplined and free, both unified in will and individual hearts are comfortable, lively and vivid.

    齐齐哈尔车辆厂在人民解放军帮助下建立崭新的干群关系
    革命职工听毛主席的话热情帮助革委会  革委会坚持群众路线正确对待职工批评
    编者按：新生的革命委员会，在工作中出现这样那样的缺点和错误，怎么办？
    齐齐哈尔车辆厂的革命职工，以国家主人翁的伟大责任感，满腔热情地帮助革命委员会克服缺点，改进工作。他们既尖锐地提出批评意见，又恳切地希望革命委员会的成员“千万不要再走从前的老路”，要成为永远忠于毛主席、密切联系群众、和群众心贴心的领导。
    毛主席教导我们：“任何政党，任何个人，错误总是难免的，我们要求犯得少一点。犯了错误则要求改正，改正得越迅速，越彻底，越好。”
    车辆厂革命委员会的同志，在听到群众的批评以后，所采取的态度，也是正确的。他们把群众的批评，当作改变作风和改进工作的动力。这样，革命委员会不仅没有降低威信，相反的，在群众中进一步树立起了无产阶级权威。
    我们希望各级革命委员会的同志和广大革命群众，在毛泽东思想的基础上，建立起崭新的干群关系，以便团结一致，共同对敌，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    本报讯　黑龙江省齐齐哈尔车辆厂的革命职工，以主人翁的态度，满腔热情地帮助厂革命委员会克服缺点，改进工作。厂革命委员会成员虚心听取群众的意见，依靠群众的监督和帮助，使革命委员会真正成为革命化的联系群众的战斗指挥部。
    这个厂的革命委员会成立以来，在解放军某部驻厂毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，狠抓毛主席最新指示的落实，全厂按车间、按部门实现了革命大联合，百分之九十五以上的干部站出来革命，百分之九十五以上的职工参加了毛泽东思想学习班，革命和生产形势大好，革命委员会的无产阶级革命权威在斗争中逐步树立起来。
    但是，革命委员会有些成员由于逐渐滋长了自满情绪，浮在上面的多了，深入下去的少了；自己作决定的多了，同群众商量的少了；指手画脚的多了，具体帮助的少了。同时，由于原有的一套重叠的机构，基本上没有多大变动，许多成员被圈在办公室里，忙事务，打电话，听汇报，深入不下去。
    这些现象，全厂革命职工看在眼里，急在心上。起重机车间大车班的革命职工，针对这些现象，进行了充分的讨论和研究。他们说：革命委员会成立了，这只是新的长征的开始，今后的路子更远，担子更重，责任更大。看看厂革委会出现的问题，想想过去原厂党委内一小撮走资派执行修正主义办企业路线的教训，我们完全有责任帮助革委会克服缺点，改进工作。厂革委会的干部是我们的领导，也是我们的战友和阶级兄弟，我们有意见一定要向他们提，我们的心里话，一定要同他们说。全班革命职工决定给厂革命委员会送一张大字报。
    这张大字报首先肯定了革命委员会成立以来所取得的成绩，同时，尖锐地指出了革命委员会存在的问题。最后，提出了希望：“革命的干部同志们，过去的教训，历历在目，记忆犹新，千万不要再走从前的老路。我们工人不愿看到干部犯错误，你们犯错误，革命事业受损失，我们痛心。我们要的是永远忠于毛主席、深入群众、和我们心贴心的好领导。我们不要屁股不离椅子，高高在上，靠电话，听汇报过日子的官老爷。”
    革命委员会的同志听说大车班工人同志送来了大字报，马上和工作人员一起热情接待。大车班的工人同志诚恳地说：“我们的意见很不成熟，提出来和你们一起研究。如果你们认为有必要的话，就把这张大字报贴出去。”
    革命委员会的同志看了这张大字报，震动很大，他们十分激动地向大车班的同志表示：“这张革命的大字报好得很！不但我们要认真学习，我们还希望全厂的革命同志都向你们学习。”他们把这张大字报立即贴到工厂大门口最显眼的地方。厂革委会主任张达开连夜召开了常委扩大会议，反复学习这张大字报。大家一致认为：这张大字报充分反映了无产阶级革命派对厂革委会的深厚阶级感情，是对领导班子最大的帮助和爱护，向我们指出了厂革委会成立以后走什么道路、如何健康成长的大问题。为了更广泛发动革命群众学习讨论，厂革委会将大字报印发全厂，并作出决议，号召全厂革命职工向大车班学习，发扬敢想、敢说、敢干的革命精神，向厂革委会提出批评、建议，帮助革委会克服缺点，改进工作。
    厂革委会对这张大字报的态度和行动，引起了全厂强烈的反响。许多干部表示：“一定要向工人同志学习，把工人同志的批评当作改变作风、改进工作的动力。”厂革委会所属的许多单位都根据实际情况，立即抽调人员充实生产第一线，很快就有百分之三十的工作人员去车间、班组工作。
    在解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，厂革命委员会成员进一步学习了毛主席关于“要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生”的教导。大家认识到：两条路线斗争，斗来斗去，就是斗在如何对待群众的根本态度上。在无产阶级专政条件下掌权，一定要依靠群众掌权，领导班子只有扎根于群众之中，做群众的小学生，虚心倾听群众的意见，才能真正代表群众掌权，才能站在运动的前列，团结和带领群众对阶级敌人进行战斗，使革命政权永远鲜红。因此，革委会常委决定开门整风。
    整风中，厂领导班子进一步认识到：革命委员会不是从天上掉下来的，它的成员不可避免地会把旧的习惯和作风，或多或少地带进革命机构中来。如果不认识这个问题，不依靠群众清除这些污泥浊水，无产阶级政权的性质就要发生变化。他们狠斗了私字，向全厂革命职工深刻检查了自己开始脱离群众的倾向，制定了革委会成员和全厂干部参加集体生产劳动，下车间、班组蹲点等制度。革委会成员还和工作人员组成毛泽东思想宣传队，深入职工、家属中宣传毛泽东思想。有三名常委带领四十多名干部，分别下到五个车间，同工人一起研究落实毛主席最新指示的措施，先后总结了巩固革命大联合、解放干部和办学习班的经验，并召开讲用大会向全厂推广，有力地推动了厂里的运动。这样一来，工人有心里话，就向干部谈，群众有意见，就爽爽快快地向领导提出来，形成了又有集中又有民主，又有纪律又有自由，又有统一意志又有个人心情舒畅，生动活泼的政治局面。　（齐向阳）
