	The higher authorities want to transfer one member from our factory's Revolutionary Committee. Initially, I, driven by bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, disagreed with the transfer of a member who was originally from our organization. Later, after studying Chairman Mao's teachings, I realized:

	Revolutionary Committee members can only be those who uphold Mao Zedong Thought.

	Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Tonghua Paper Mill, Jilin Province, Li Wenrong

	Bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is a stubborn enemy. In one place, you defeat it, and in another, it reemerges in a different form. Therefore, factionalism must be repeatedly and constantly fought against. After our factory implemented the revolutionary three-in-one combination, factionalism manifested in my mind in a new form.

	Once, the higher authorities wanted to transfer one member from our factory's Revolutionary Committee to work in the Municipal Workers' Congress Preparatory Committee. In a meeting of the Revolutionary Committee, the majority agreed to send Li Baomin. At that time, I thought: Li Baomin was originally from our organization. If he is transferred, our organization will lose one seat in the Revolutionary Committee, and when deciding on issues, we will lose one vote, which is not beneficial to my future work. Therefore, I wanted to use the excuse that Li Baomin has many responsibilities in the factory and cannot leave easily to disagree with his transfer. But I immediately realized that this was factionalism at work.

	Therefore, I studied Chairman Mao's teachings with this issue in mind: "Not considering the overall situation, being indifferent to other departments, other places, and other people, is the characteristic of such localists. For such people, education must be intensified to make them understand that this is a tendency of sectarianism. If it develops, it is very dangerous." This made me realize that bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism is not only an enemy of implementing the revolutionary three-in-one combination but also an enemy of consolidating it. Our factory's Revolutionary Committee is an organ of power representing the common interests of revolutionary workers. It is not a mass organization or a liaison station. In the Revolutionary Committee, there can only be one faction, and that is the faction of Mao Zedong Thought. No other factions can exist. After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, as a leader of the Revolutionary Committee, one must fiercely fight against selfishness and thoroughly smash bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. Only by completely eliminating bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism can the Revolutionary Committee become an organ of power representing the common interests of revolutionary workers. Only then can the thoughts of each committee member be unified on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, with everyone thinking in the same direction and exerting effort in the same way, consolidating the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and seizing power for the proletariat.

	After understanding this, my view on transferring Li Baomin changed. I realized that Li Baomin going to work in the city is a matter of the relationship between the overall situation and the local situation. The local situation should serve the overall situation. Thus, I actively supported the opinion of transferring Li Baomin to work in the Municipal Workers' Congress and examined my own incorrect thoughts.

### 革委会成员只能是毛泽东思想革命派

    上级要从我厂革委会抽一名委员。我从资产阶级、小资产阶级派性出发，不同意抽调原来是我们组织的委员。后来，我学习了毛主席的教导，认识到：
    革委会成员只能是毛泽东思想革命派
    吉林省通化市造纸厂革命委员会副主任  李文荣
    资产阶级、小资产阶级派性是个顽固的敌人。在这个地方你把它打倒了，在另一个地方它又会以不同形式出来表演。因此，对派性必须反复斗，经常斗。我们厂实现革命三结合后，派性在我头脑里又以一种新形式表现出来了。
    一次，上级要从我厂抽一名革委会委员，去市工代会筹委会工作。在革委会的一次会上，多数同志同意李宝民去。当时我想：李宝民原是我们组织的人，如果把他调走，革委会中我们这个组织就少了一个席位，决定什么问题时，我们就少了一票，对我今后工作不利。因此，我就想以李宝民在厂内担任工作多离不开厂为借口，不同意抽李宝民去。但马上意识到，这又是派性在作怪。
    因此，我带着这个问题学习了毛主席的教导：“不顾大局，对别部、别地、别人漠不关心，就是这种本位主义者的特点。对于这样的人，必须加重教育，使他们懂得这就是一种宗派主义的倾向，如果发展下去，是很危险的。”这使我感到：资产阶级、小资产阶级派性不仅是实现革命三结合的大敌，而且还是巩固革命三结合的大敌。我厂革命委员会是代表革命职工共同利益的权力机构。它不是群众联合组织、联络站。在革命委员会中，只能有一派，这就是毛泽东思想革命派，绝不能有其它任何一派存在。在革命委员会成立以后，作为革命委员会的领导成员，更要狠斗私心，大破资产阶级、小资产阶级派性。只有彻底铲除资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，才能使革命委员会成为代表革命职工共同利益的权力机构，各个委员的思想才能在毛泽东思想的基础上统一起来，心往一处想，劲往一处使，巩固革命的三结合，为无产阶级掌好权。
    思想通了，对抽调李宝民的看法也变了。我认识到：李宝民调市里去工作，这是全局和局部的关系，局部应该服从全局。于是我积极支持了调李宝民去市工代会工作的意见，并检查了自己的不正确的思想。
