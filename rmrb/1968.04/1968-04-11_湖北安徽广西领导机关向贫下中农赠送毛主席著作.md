	The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadres have expressed that they will definitely continue to establish and run well Mao Zedong Thought study classes, turning the countryside into a red Mao Zedong Thought school; they will definitely treat Chairman Mao's books as family treasures, passing them down from generation to generation.

	Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, April 10th — The Hubei Provincial Revolutionary Committee recently decided to donate two thousand three hundred million copies of Chairman Mao's revolutionary classics to the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants across the province, further promoting the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in the countryside to develop more broadly and deeply. This is a major event in the political life of the poor and lower-middle peasants across Hubei.

	This time, the donated revolutionary classics include "Quotations from Chairman Mao," "Against Liberalism," "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," and important instructions given by Chairman Mao during his inspections of North China, Central South, and East China. Currently, these two thousand three hundred million copies of revolutionary classics have been gradually sent to the countryside across the province.

	In the "Notice on Donating Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Classics to Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants," the Hubei Provincial Revolutionary Committee pointed out: Through the donation of revolutionary classics, we must further arouse the deep proletarian feelings of boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty for our great leader Chairman Mao among the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, and enhance their awareness of studying and mastering Mao Zedong Thought; we must further carry forward the revolutionary learning style of combining theory with practice, which our great leader Chairman Mao personally advocated, and focus on the "application" aspect; we must respond to the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao to "criticize and repudiate revisionism and carry the revolution through to the end," fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and do a better job in all aspects, carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

	Revolutionary comrades from various departments related to transportation, railways, transportation, postal services, publishing, printing, distribution, and supply and marketing cooperatives in Hubei Province are, with the greatest political enthusiasm, overcoming all difficulties and using the fastest speed to deliver the red revolutionary classics to every household of poor and lower-middle peasants.

	Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, April 10th — The Anhui Provincial leadership recently decided to donate one copy each of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and the "Three Articles" to every household of poor and lower-middle peasants across the province. This is a major event in the political life of several million households of poor and lower-middle peasants in Anhui!

	Currently, while the poor and lower-middle peasants in Anhui are vigorously promoting spring farming production, they are also launching an unprecedented scale of establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes and the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Nearly five hundred thousand study classes of various types have been established across the province, with nearly three million people participating in the study. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have been greatly inspired by obtaining the revolutionary classics and are determined to push the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to new heights.

	Various places held grand ceremonies when distributing the revolutionary classics to the poor and lower-middle peasants. Many poor and lower-middle peasants expressed their excitement at the ceremonies, saying that Chairman Mao cares so much for us poor and lower-middle peasants, and we will definitely follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life, be loyal to our great leader Chairman Mao with a single "loyalty," and grasp the "application" of Mao Zedong Thought with a single "strength." Wherever Chairman Mao points, we will rush there. Xiong Huacheng, an old poor peasant from Xinghua Village People's Commune in the suburbs of Hefei, was extremely excited when he received the revolutionary classics. That night, he told his family: "In the old society, we poor and lower-middle peasants were oppressed by three big mountains and had no sunlight. Chairman Mao liberated us and enabled us to live a happy life. We must read Chairman Mao's books every day, never forget class struggle, and follow Chairman Mao in revolution forever, never changing our hearts."

	After receiving Chairman Mao's revolutionary classics, the broad masses of grassroots cadres expressed that they will definitely, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, continue to establish and run well Mao Zedong Thought study classes, turning the countryside into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

	Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, April 10th — The Guangxi Revolutionary Preparatory Group and the Guangxi Military Region, in order to promote the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought more broadly and deeply across the autonomous region, and to meet the revolutionary demands of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadres in the countryside, recently donated one copy each of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and the "Three Articles" to every household of the more than five hundred thirty thousand households of poor and lower-middle peasants across the region; one copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to each of the more than one hundred eighty thousand production brigades and production team cadres; and a batch of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" (Type A and Type B) and the "Three Articles" to each production team. Now, the revolutionary classics have been gradually delivered to the revolutionary masses.

	Since this year, the great mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought has been more magnificent across Guangxi. Mao Zedong Thought study classes have been widely established in the vast countryside. After the news of the Guangxi Revolutionary Preparatory Group and the Guangxi Military Region donating revolutionary classics to the poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadres in the countryside was announced, the countryside was filled with joy. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadres, with deep class feelings of boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty for Chairman Mao, set up bookstands for Chairman Mao's works at home and hung large banners with slogans such as "A ship sailing in the vast sea needs a helmsman, and a revolution needs Mao Zedong Thought" and "The party's favor is greater than the sky and earth, and Chairman Mao's favor is greater than that of parents" in the village center to welcome the revolutionary classics.

	In the remote villages and tribes of the northern mountains of Guilin, such as the Miao and Yao ethnic minorities, the poor and lower-middle peasants held high the plaques of Chairman Mao's quotations, blew the suona horns, and walked thirty or forty miles to welcome the shining golden revolutionary classics of Chairman Mao. They held the revolutionary classics to their chests, excitedly wishing Chairman Mao a long life, ten thousand years of life! The poor and lower-middle peasants, fishermen, and impoverished fishermen of the communes of Xiantian, Dijiao, and Waisha in Beihai City on the northern coast of the Gulf of Tonkin held grand ceremonies to distribute the revolutionary classics. They resolutely responded to the call of Vice Chairman Lin, reading Chairman Mao's books for life, listening to Chairman Mao's words for life, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions for life, treating Chairman Mao's books as family treasures, passing them down from generation to generation.
