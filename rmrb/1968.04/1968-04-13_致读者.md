To the Readers,

The special edition of our newspaper titled "Seven Hundred Million People All Become Critics" has been published for over fifty issues with the support of the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, and Red Guards. On this special edition, the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, and Red Guards have used Mao Zedong Thought as the sharpest weapon to fiercely criticize the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev. They say that this edition is our battlefield for opening fire on China's Khrushchev, and at the same time, it is our classroom for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought and promoting the revolutionization of ideology.

To carry out the profound and sustained revolutionary criticism, this special edition must continue and be improved. This is the hope of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and it is also the responsibility of the editors of this newspaper.

The handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, although they have been overthrown, will never be content with their failure. They are always dreaming of a comeback and are engaged in various conspiratorial and sabotage activities. The poison of revisionism they have spread in various fields has not been completely eradicated. Therefore, to thoroughly criticize and expose them politically, ideologically, and theoretically, we must further mobilize the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, and Red Guards to join the battle of revolutionary criticism.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolutionary war is the people's war. Only by mobilizing the masses can we wage war, and only by relying on the masses can we wage war."

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers are the main force of the Cultural Revolution and have always been at the forefront of the struggle. They have the deepest class feelings for Chairman Mao, the firmest stand, and the greatest hatred for the capitalist roaders. They have the right to speak in the revolutionary criticism. The criticism articles they write are like sharp daggers, piercing the enemy's heart. They set up battlefields in workshops, fields, barracks, and classrooms, making China's Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party drown in the vast ocean of the people's war. Therefore, the class enemies are most afraid of workers, peasants, and soldiers taking the political stage and most afraid of them joining the battlefield of revolutionary criticism.

Today, our newspaper has selected a batch of letters and articles from worker, peasant, and soldier readers and authors. They have expressed their enthusiastic support for the special edition "Seven Hundred Million People All Become Critics" and have also made many valuable criticisms and suggestions for the special edition. This is an encouragement and a spur to us. We are willing to work together with the broad readers and authors, under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, to strive to make this special edition better, making it more combative and more closely linked to the current class struggle situation and tasks. We will better reflect the new achievements won by the hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, soldiers, and Red Guards on the battlefield of revolutionary criticism.

    致读者
    本报《七亿人民都来做批判家》专版，在广大工农兵群众和红卫兵革命小将的支持下，从创办以来，已经出刊五十多期了。
    在这个专版上，广大工农兵群众和红卫兵革命小将运用毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派。他们说，这个版是我们向中国赫鲁晓夫开火的战场，同时也是我们活学活用毛泽东思想、促进思想革命化的课堂。
    为了把革命的大批判深入地持久地开展下去，这个专版一定要继续办，而且要办得更好。这是广大工农兵群众的希望，也是本报编者的责任。
    党内最大的一小撮走资派，虽然已经被打倒了，但是他们绝不会甘心自己的失败，每时每刻都在梦想着复辟，进行种种阴谋破坏活动。他们散布在各个领域里的修正主义毒素，还远远没有肃清。因此，要把他们从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批倒批臭，必须进一步发动广大工农兵群众和红卫兵革命小将投入革命大批判的战斗中来。
    毛主席教导我们：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”
    广大工农兵群众是文化大革命的主力军，始终站在斗争的最前线。他们热爱毛主席的阶级感情最深，立场最坚定，对走资派最仇恨。进行革命的大批判，他们最有发言权。他们挥笔上阵，写出来的批判文章，象一把把锋利的匕首，直刺敌人的心脏。他们在车间、田头、营房和课堂，处处摆开战场，使中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派陷入“人民战争”的汪洋大海之中。因此，阶级敌人最害怕工农兵登上政治舞台，最害怕他们杀上大批判战场。
    今天，本报选登了一批工农兵读者和作者的来信和文章。他们表示了对《七亿人民都来做批判家》这个专版的热烈支持，同时对专版提出了许多宝贵的批评和建议。这是对我们的鼓励和鞭策。我们愿意和广大读者、作者共勉，在伟大的毛泽东思想的指导下，努力把这个专版办得更好，使它更加战斗化，更加紧密地结合当前的阶级斗争的形势和任务，把亿万工农兵群众和红卫兵革命小将在革命大批判战场上杀出来的新的战果，更好地反映出来。
