Under the assistance of the PLA Beijing Garrison Support-Left Group, the Revolutionary Committee of the Eleventh Research Institute of a certain research institute has played a combat role. It has mobilized the masses to resolutely repel the attacks of the class enemy. The newly established Revolutionary Committee has been consolidated through repeated struggles with the class enemy, and the broad masses have significantly enhanced their class struggle consciousness and awareness of line struggle.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 22nd, the PLA Beijing Garrison Support-Left Group of a certain unit has followed the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle." They have enthusiastically assisted the Revolutionary Committee of the Eleventh Research Institute of a certain research institute. They have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasized proletarian politics, and focused on class struggle. This has made the newly established Revolutionary Committee a combat command center that leads the revolutionary masses in continuously launching proactive attacks against the class enemy.

The Revolutionary Committee of this research institute was established in November last year. Amidst the celebration of victory, some comrades thought that the power had already been seized by the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, and they could now relax. Under the assistance of the PLA Support-Left Group, the Revolutionary Committee and all the revolutionary masses of the institute repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings of "never forget class struggle" and "we must never relax our vigilance against the frenzied revenge plots of the imperialist elements and their running dogs. Whoever relaxes this vigilance will be politically disarmed and placed in a passive position." They recognized that the idea of relaxing was a reflection of weakened class struggle consciousness and complacency. Therefore, they mobilized the masses to combine the actual class, two-line, and two-road struggles within the institute. They launched a thorough criticism of China's Khrushchev and other top walk-capitalist roaders within the party and their agents. They studied Chairman Mao's teachings and severely criticized China's Khrushchev's fallacies of slavery, crawling, and eliminationism in scientific research. At the same time, the revolutionary masses of the entire institute further directed their struggle spearhead towards the handful of walk-capitalist roaders within the party. They continued to expose, criticize, and struggle against them, thoroughly eliminating the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of scientific research in this institute. The revolutionary criticism greatly aroused and enhanced the class struggle consciousness and awareness of line struggle among the broad revolutionary masses, and dealt a heavy blow to the class enemy.

As the revolutionary criticism deepened, the counter-revolutionary faces of the handful of walk-capitalist roaders within the party were fully exposed. However, the class enemy was not reconciled to their failure. Their plots became more concealed, and their methods more cunning. In response to this situation, the PLA Support-Left Group and the comrades of the Revolutionary Committee repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings of "the counter-revolutionaries who appear in disguise conceal their true nature but reveal a false one. However, since they are counter-revolutionaries, they cannot conceal their true nature completely" and "we must never relax our vigilance." This made everyone understand that under the dictatorship of the proletariat, one must be especially vigilant and skilled in identifying enemies who engage in sabotage activities under special circumstances. They mobilized and guided the masses to take the initiative to launch attacks and resolutely repel their offensives. At that time, in one section, the antagonistic sentiments among the masses were very strong. Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions and some resolutions of the Revolutionary Committee encountered great resistance in implementation in this section, and some even openly declared "to kick out the Revolutionary Committee." What was the reason for this? The PLA Support-Left Group and the comrades of the Revolutionary Committee conducted investigations and research in this section, conducted class struggle and line struggle education for the masses, quickly raised the class struggle consciousness of the masses, overcame bourgeois factionalism, and strengthened proletarian party spirit. They exposed two bad elements who had infiltrated the mass organizations in this section. These two bad elements played double-faced tricks during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, stirred up trouble among the masses, and created chaos; after the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, these two bad elements further fanned the wind of evil, trying to overthrow the newly established Revolutionary Committee. After these two bad elements were exposed by the revolutionary masses, the entire section quickly achieved revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination. In summarizing the experience and lessons, the revolutionary masses of this section pasted Chairman Mao's quotation of "class struggle, once grasped, all problems are solved" in the office. They said: This is the wise teaching of the great leader Chairman Mao, and it is also the best experience of the newly established Revolutionary Committee leading us to grasp class struggle according to Chairman Mao's teachings and achieve victory in the struggle. We must always remember Chairman Mao's great teaching and never forget class struggle, and we must defend the newly established Revolutionary Committee to the death.

The Revolutionary Committee used this living example of class struggle to educate the revolutionary masses of the entire institute, further enhancing the class struggle consciousness and awareness of line struggle among the broad revolutionary masses. When the class enemy used the reactionary anarchist trend to launch a new attack on the Revolutionary Committee, attempting to overthrow the newly established Revolutionary Committee, the revolutionary cadres and masses of the entire institute, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, immediately saw through the enemy's plot. They focused on class struggle, launching a mass struggle to consciously defend the newly established Revolutionary Committee, and once again foiled the new plot of the class enemy, consolidating the newly established Revolutionary Committee through repeated struggles with the class enemy.

Under the leadership of the Revolutionary Committee, the revolutionary masses continuously launched proactive attacks against the class enemy and achieved victory after victory. However, some people again became complacent. But the handful of walk-capitalist roaders within the institute and the untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists joined forces to engage in counter-revolutionary rehabilitation activities. At this time, the latest instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao were transmitted: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution under the conditions of socialism, a revolution by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its leadership of the broad revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." The support-left personnel and members of the Revolutionary Committee immediately led the masses to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, focusing on situation education, further enhancing the class struggle consciousness and awareness of line struggle among the broad revolutionary masses. Everyone deeply realized that the closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to complete victory, the more the class enemy will struggle desperately, and the more we must enhance our revolutionary vigilance. On this basis, the PLA Support-Left Group and the Revolutionary Committee timely guided and led the revolutionary masses of the entire institute with the thorough revolutionary spirit of "it is better to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining strength." They launched a thorough exposure, criticism, and struggle against the rightist rehabilitation activities of the handful of walk-capitalist roaders and ghosts and snakes within the institute, once again foiling the evil plot of the class enemy to overthrow the newly established Revolutionary Committee.

    在驻京部队支左小组帮助下某研究院第十一研究所革委会发挥战斗作用
    广泛发动群众坚决打退阶级敌人的进攻
    新生的革委会在同阶级敌人反复较量中得到巩固，广大群众阶级斗争观念和路线斗争觉悟大大提高
    据新华社二十二日讯  人民解放军驻京部队某部支左小组遵循伟大领袖毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，热情帮助某研究院第十一研究所革命委员会，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，狠抓阶级斗争，使新生的革命委员会成为带领革命群众不停顿地向阶级敌人主动进攻的战斗指挥部。
    这个研究所的革命委员会是去年十一月成立的。在欢庆胜利的锣鼓声中，有些同志觉得大权已经掌握在无产阶级革命派的手里，可以松一口气了。革委会在解放军支左小组的帮助下，和全所革命群众一起，反复学习毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”和“我们决不可因为胜利，而放松对于帝国主义分子及其走狗们的疯狂的报复阴谋的警惕性，谁要是放松这一项警惕性，谁就将在政治上解除武装，而使自己处于被动的地位”的教导，认识到松一口气的想法是阶级斗争观念减弱、轻敌麻痹思想的反映。于是，他们就广泛发动群众结合本所两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的实际，深入展开革命的大批判，进一步从政治上、思想上、理论上向中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派及其代理人发动进攻。他们学习毛主席的教导，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫在科学研究上推行的奴隶主义、爬行主义、取消主义的谬论。与此同时，全所革命群众进一步把斗争矛头指向党内一小撮走资派，继续对他们展开大揭发、大批判、大斗争，彻底肃清反革命修正主义科研路线在这个所的流毒。革命的大批判，大大激发和提高了广大革命群众的阶级斗争观念和路线斗争觉悟，狠狠地打击了阶级敌人。
    随着革命大批判的深入开展，所里党内一小撮走资派的反革命面目彻底暴露了。但是阶级敌人不甘心于自己的失败，他们的阴谋，更加隐蔽，手段更加狡猾。针对这一情况，解放军支左小组和革委会的同志一起反复学习了毛主席的“以伪装出现的反革命分子，他们给人以假象，而将真象荫蔽着。但是他们既要反革命，就不可能将其真象荫蔽得十分彻底”和“我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性”的教导，使大家懂得，在无产阶级专政条件下，要特别警惕和善于识别那些在特殊情况下从事破坏活动的敌人，发动和引导群众主动出击，坚决打退他们的进攻。当时，有一个科，群众之间对立情绪很大，毛主席的一系列最新指示，革委会的一些决议，在这个科里贯彻、落实受到很大阻力，甚至有人公开扬言“要踢开革委会”。这是什么原因呢？解放军支左小组和革委会的同志深入到这个科，进行调查研究，对群众进行阶级斗争和路线斗争教育，迅速提高了群众的阶级斗争觉悟，克服了资产阶级派性，增强了无产阶级党性，在这个科里揪出了钻进群众组织的两个坏家伙。这两个坏家伙，在无产阶级文化大革命中，大耍两面派手法，在群众中挑拨离间，制造混乱；革委会成立后，这两个坏家伙更是煽阴风，点邪火，妄图搞垮新生的革委会。当这两个坏家伙被革命群众揪出来以后，全科很快实现了革命的大联合和革命的三结合。在总结经验教训时，这个科的革命群众把伟大领袖毛主席“阶级斗争，一抓就灵”的语录贴在办公室里，他们说：这是伟大领袖毛主席的英明教导，也是新生的革委会按照毛主席的教导，带领我们狠抓阶级斗争，取得斗争胜利的最好经验，我们要永远牢记毛主席这一伟大教导，念念不忘阶级斗争，誓死捍卫新生的革命委员会。
    革委会用这个活生生的阶级斗争事例，对全所革命群众进行教育，进一步提高了广大革命群众的阶级斗争觉悟和路线斗争觉悟。当阶级敌人利用反动的无政府主义思潮，向革委会发动新的进攻，妄图颠覆新生的革命委员会的时候，用毛泽东思想武装起来的全所革命干部和革命群众，立即识破了敌人的阴谋。他们狠抓阶级斗争，掀起了一场群众性的自觉捍卫新生的革命委员会的斗争，又一次粉碎了阶级敌人的新阴谋，使新生的革委会在同阶级敌人的反复较量中得到了巩固。
    在革委会带领革命群众不停顿地向阶级敌人主动进攻、并获得节节胜利的大好形势下，有些人又产生了松懈情绪。但所内一小撮走资派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，却勾结起来，大搞反革命翻案活动。这时，传来了我们伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”支左人员和革委会成员，立即带领群众反复学习毛主席这一最新指示，狠抓形势教育，进一步提高了广大革命群众的阶级斗争观念和路线斗争觉悟。大家深刻地认识到，无产阶级文化大革命越是接近全面胜利，阶级敌人越是要作垂死挣扎，我们越是要提高革命警惕性。在认识提高的基础上，解放军支左小组和革委会及时引导和带领全所广大革命群众以“宜将剩勇追穷寇”的彻底革命精神，对所里一小撮走资派和牛鬼蛇神的右倾翻案活动，进行了大揭发、大批判、大斗争，又一次粉碎了阶级敌人颠覆新生的革命委员会的罪恶阴谋。
