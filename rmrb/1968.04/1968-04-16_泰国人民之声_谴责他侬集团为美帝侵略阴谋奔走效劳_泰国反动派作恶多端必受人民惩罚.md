“Voice of the Thai People” radio station recently issued a commentary pointing out that recently, the puppet Deputy Prime Minister Praphas has been actively engaging in activities to serve U.S. imperialism’s policy of aggression and war, once again proving that the Thanom-Praphas traitorous clique is a faithful running dog of U.S. imperialism.

The commentary said that recently, the puppet Deputy Prime Minister Praphas, following the instructions of his U.S. imperialist masters, visited the area of Taiwan controlled by the Chiang bandits, as well as the Philippines, Japan, and South Korea, to engage in counter-revolutionary collusion activities. He attempted to form a new reactionary military alliance to serve U.S. imperialism’s continued expansion of aggression in Asia, deluding himself into thinking that he could thereby rescue U.S. imperialism from its miserable defeat in the Vietnam War.

The commentary said that Praphas’ counter-revolutionary collusion is a serious provocation against the peoples of Asia and the 700 million people of China. The Thanom-Praphas traitorous clique stubbornly insists on opposing the peoples of Thailand, Vietnam, China, and Asia, and will inevitably receive the punishment they deserve.

The commentary pointed out that the Thanom-Praphas traitorous clique is so eager to serve U.S. imperialism in order to beg for more “aid” from the U.S., deluding themselves into thinking that they can extinguish the revolutionary flames of the Thai people and maintain their shaky rule.

The commentary emphasized that the Thai people’s revolutionary struggle against U.S. imperialist aggression and to overthrow the Thanom-Praphas traitorous clique is unstoppable by any force.

    “泰国人民之声”谴责他侬集团为美帝侵略阴谋奔走效
    劳泰国反动派作恶多端必受人民惩罚
    新华社讯　“泰国人民之声”电台最近发表评论指出，最近，泰国傀儡副总理巴博四出活动，为美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策效劳，再一次表明他侬—巴博卖国集团是美帝国主义的忠实走狗。
    评论说，最近，傀儡副总理巴博秉承其主子美帝国主义的意旨，到蒋匪帮盘踞的中国领土台湾以及菲律宾、日本、南朝鲜进行反革命串连活动，企图拼凑新的反动军事联盟，为美帝继续在亚洲扩大侵略战争效劳，妄图借此来挽救美帝在侵越战争中的惨败。
    评论说，巴博的这次反革命串连，是对亚洲人民和七亿中国人民的严重挑衅。他侬—巴博卖国集团顽固地要同泰国人民、越南人民、中国人民和亚洲人民为敌，必将受到应得的惩罚。
    评论指出，他侬—巴博卖国集团如此卖力地为美帝国主义效劳，是为了向美帝乞求更多的“援助”，妄图扑灭泰国人民的革命烈火，维护他们摇摇欲坠的统治。
    评论强调说，泰国人民反对美帝国主义侵略、推翻他侬—巴博卖国集团的革命斗争，是任何力量都不能阻挡的。
