Spring thunder shakes the night sky, and the surging waves of passion. On the night of April 16 at twelve o'clock, I heard from the radio our great leader Chairman Mao's statement "Support the American Black People's Struggle Against Violence." Chairman Mao's statement is a great call to battle. It inspires all the people of China and all revolutionary people of the world to launch a fierce attack on American imperialism and its lackeys. The thorough collapse of colonialism, imperialism, and all systems of exploitation is not far off. All the people of China are cheering! All the revolutionary people of the world are cheering!

In the face of the excellent situation where the revolutionary struggles of the world's people are surging forward and imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries are on the brink of collapse, our great leader Chairman Mao issued the statement "Support the American Black People's Struggle Against Violence." This not only gives American blacks but also gives all the revolutionary people of the world endless courage and strength to defeat American imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries. Our great leader Chairman Mao always cares about the liberation struggles of the world's revolutionary people. Chairman Mao's statement wisely points out the direction of the struggle for American blacks and illuminates the path forward for American blacks.

The statement of our great leader Chairman Mao fully expresses the common will of the 700 million Chinese people. The oppressed and exploited blacks in America are our class brothers, and the oppressed and exploited people of all countries in the world are our class brothers. Our fates are linked, and our joys and sorrows are shared. The revolutions of the world's people are always mutually supportive. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people who have already won revolutionary victories should support the struggles of the people who are still fighting for liberation. This is our internationalist duty." We must have our hearts in the ranks, our chests open to the world, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and in the three great revolutionary movements, radiate our own light and heat, and achieve new merits for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution!

Great Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards total collapse and socialism is marching towards global victory. Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon for the world's revolutionary people to oppose imperialism, a powerful ideological weapon to oppose revisionism and dogmatism. The great leader Chairman Mao's voice, which is as powerful as mountains and rivers, will reach the hearts of the revolutionary people of all countries in the world and will produce an immense force. Under the inspiration of the great Mao Zedong Thought, the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of the world's people will surely achieve more and more brilliant victories.

    春雷震夜空，激情如潮涌。四月十六日夜里十二点，我从广播里听到了我们伟大领袖毛主席《支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明》。毛主席的声明，是伟大的战斗号召。它鼓舞着全中国和全世界革命人民向美帝国主义及其帮凶们发起猛烈的进攻。殖民主义、帝国主义和一切剥削制度的彻底崩溃，已经为期不远了。全中国人民在欢呼！全世界革命人民在欢呼！
    在世界人民革命斗争日益高涨，帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派日暮途穷的大好形势下，伟大领袖毛主席发表了《支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明》，这不仅给了美国黑人，而且给了全世界革命人民战胜美帝国主义和各国反动派以无穷无尽的勇气和力量。伟大领袖毛主席时刻关怀着世界革命人民的解放斗争。毛主席的这个声明，英明地指出了美国黑人斗争的方向，照亮了美国黑人前进的道路。
    伟大领袖毛主席的声明，充分地表达了七亿中国人民的共同意志。美国受压迫、受剥削的黑人，是我们的阶级兄弟，世界各国受压迫、受剥削的人民，都是我们的阶级兄弟。我们命运相连，休戚相关。世界人民的革命总是互相支援的。毛主席教导我们：“已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争，这是我们的国际主义的义务。”我们要心在连队，胸怀全球，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在三大革命运动中，发出自己的光和热，为中国革命和世界革命立新功！
    伟大的毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想是世界革命人民反对帝国主义的强大的思想武器，是反对修正主义和教条主义的强大的思想武器。伟大领袖毛主席气壮山河的声音，传到世界各国革命人民的心坎里，将会产生无比巨大的力量。在伟大的毛泽东思想的鼓舞下，世界人民的反帝革命斗争，必将取得越来越光辉的胜利。
