The Afro-Asian Writers' Association issued a statement on April 18 saying that Chairman Mao Zedong's declaration in support of the struggle of American blacks against violence is not only a great encouragement and inspiration for the struggle of American blacks, but also a great encouragement and inspiration for the Vietnamese people and all the peoples of the world who are fighting for national liberation, racial equality, people's democracy, and socialism against U.S.-led imperialism and its lackeys.

The statement said that Chairman Mao pointed out: "The struggle of American blacks for liberation is a component part of the total struggle of the peoples of the world against U.S. imperialism, and a component part of the world revolution today." Chairman Mao, with his profound understanding and foresight, has elucidated the current situation of the world revolution. Chairman Mao Zedong's declaration is a guide to action for all revolutionary and progressive writers and peoples.

The statement said that while Chairman Mao, on behalf of the Chinese people, firmly supports the struggle of American blacks against violence, he also firmly calls on the workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and all those who are willing to oppose U.S. imperialism in various countries of the world to take action and give strong support to the struggle of American blacks. This is a great encouragement to the Afro-Asian writers' movement, of which our permanent bureau is the leader.

The statement said, "We are convinced that all revolutionary and progressive peoples of the world will enthusiastically respond to the call of the greatest revolutionary leader of our time, Chairman Mao, and resolutely fight against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, striving for the liberation of all oppressed peoples."
