Once, the factory revolutionary committee decided to transfer several veteran workers from the equipment department to support the weaving workshop. The masses voiced their opinions. After discussion, the members of the revolutionary committee unanimously recognized that:

Accepting the help of the masses is the key to maintaining revolutionary youthfulness.

Since the establishment of our factory revolutionary committee, we have frequently encountered the problem of how to correctly handle relations with the masses and establish a new type of cadre-mass relationship. Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "The most fundamental aspect of reforming state organs is to connect with the masses." "To properly handle the relationship between superiors and subordinates, and to build good relations between cadres and the masses. In the future, cadres should go down to the grassroots, walk around, and see for themselves. They should adhere to the mass line, consult with the masses on all matters, and be students of the masses." We have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and have found that the more we study, the more we feel that Chairman Mao's words are the truth, and they resonate deeply with us. By comparing ourselves with Chairman Mao's latest instructions and reflecting on our work over the past period, we deeply feel that listening to Chairman Mao's words, adhering to the mass line, and "believing in and relying on the masses" is the correct path to promoting our ideological revolution and consolidating the new power.

Once, because the weaving workshop had a heavy production task, the revolutionary committee subjectively decided to transfer several veteran workers from the equipment department to support the weaving workshop. When this decision was announced, the masses reacted strongly. Some said: "The revolutionary committee is subjective and bureaucratic, only seeing the local situation and not the overall picture." How to handle the masses' criticisms and opinions, the new and old cadres of the revolutionary committee had different views. Some new cadres felt resentment, thinking, "Being a cadre means taking risks." The old cadres were mainly afraid, saying, "Now the masses' consciousness has been raised, and any mistake will lead to criticism." But the majority of the committee members believed that the masses' opinions and criticisms were correct. To unify our understanding, the PLA helped us repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teaching: "Since we serve the people, we should not fear criticism if we have shortcomings." Through study, everyone realized: The masses can boldly give us advice because Chairman Mao's revolutionary line has taken root in their hearts. This is the masses' concern for the revolutionary committee, a high sense of responsibility towards the Party's cause. With the masses' supervision and help, we can make fewer mistakes or no mistakes. Some old cadres, recalling the lessons of implementing the capitalist reactionary line in the past, said: "In the past, we made mistakes because we could not listen to the masses' opinions and criticisms." New cadres also deeply felt: "We were able to break free from the white terror of the capitalist reactionary line because we believed in and relied on the masses, and fought together with the masses through thick and thin." To be detached from the masses is to be disloyal to Chairman Mao, to make mistakes, and to be abandoned by the masses. Only by closely connecting with the masses, humbly listening to the masses' opinions, and accepting the masses' help can we maintain revolutionary youthfulness and achieve new victories for the people.

In the future, we will resolutely follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and vow to build the revolutionary committee into a "revolutionary leading cadre group that connects with the masses." We will believe in and rely on the broad revolutionary masses, continuously consolidate and develop the revolutionary tripartite alliance, and make the revolutionary committee play its due role in the struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    有一次，厂革委会决定抽调设备科几个老师傅支援编织车间，群众提出了意见。革委会成员经过讨论，一致认识到：
    接受群众的帮助就能永葆革命青春
    我厂革委会成立后经常遇到的一个问题，就是如何正确对待群众，建立起新型的干群关系。我们伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”“要很好地解决上下级关系问题，搞好干部和群众的关系。以后干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。”我们反复地学习了毛主席的最新指示，越学越感到毛主席的话句句是真理，句句说到我们的心坎上。对照毛主席的最新指示，回顾我们前一段的工作，我们深深地感到听毛主席的话，坚持群众路线，“相信和依靠群众”，是促进我们思想革命化，巩固新生政权的正确途径。
    有一次，因为编织车间生产任务重，革命委员会就主观决定抽调设备科的几位老师傅支援编织车间。这个决定一公布，群众反映很大。有的说：
  “革命委员会是主观主义，官僚主义，只看到局部，看不到全局”。如何对待群众的批评意见，革委会的新老干部各有各的看法。有的新干部就产生
  “怨”字，认为“当干部担风险”。老干部突出的是一个“怕”字，有的说“现在群众觉悟都提高了，稍有差错免不了挨批判”。但绝大部分委员认为群众的意见和批评是正确的。为了统一认识，解放军帮助我们反复学习了毛主席“因为我们是为人民服务的，所以，我们如果有缺点，就不怕别人批评指出”的教导，通过学习，大家认识到：群众能大胆地给我们提意见，这是毛主席的革命路线深入人心的结果，是群众对革命委员会的爱护，是对党的事业高度负责的精神。有了群众的监督和帮助，我们就可以少犯错误或者不犯错误。有的老干部在回忆过去执行资产阶级反动路线的教训时说：“过去所以犯错误，就是听不得群众的半点意见和批评。”新干部也深有体会地说：“我们能够从资产阶级反动路线的白色恐怖下冲杀出来，也是因为相信和依靠群众，和群众风雨同舟，共同战斗。”脱离了群众，就是对毛主席的不忠，就要犯错误，就要被群众抛弃。只有密切联系群众，虚心听取群众的意见，接受群众的帮助，才能永葆革命的青春，为人民立新功。
    今后，我们坚决遵照毛主席的最新指示，誓把革命委员会建设成为一个“革命化的联系群众的领导班子”，相信和依靠广大革命群众，不断巩固和发展革命的三结合，使革命委员会在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的斗争中发挥应有的作用。
