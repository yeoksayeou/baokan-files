The drums of revolution resound over the equator. The flames of armed struggle by the African people burn ever brighter. The revolutionary peoples of Mozambique, Angola, "Portuguese" Guinea, and Zimbabwe tightly grasp their guns to strike back at the colonial troops.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on March 31, under the inspiration of the great leader of the proletariat, Chairman Mao's brilliant thought that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," the revolutionary peoples of Mozambique, "Portuguese" Guinea, Angola, and Zimbabwe have intensified their attacks on the Portuguese colonial troops, supported by American and British imperialism, and the colonial regime of Smith in Southern Rhodesia, achieving new victories.

In East Africa's Mozambique, it is reported that the Portuguese colonial troops have been taking blows almost every day this year. Recently, with the support of the local people, the guerrilla forces in the northern provinces of Niassa and Cabo Delgado have launched a series of ambushes and attacks against the Portuguese colonial troops, annihilating over eighty enemies, destroying two enemy outposts, shooting down one enemy aircraft, and seizing a large amount of weapons and ammunition. It is reported that in the attack on the Portuguese outpost of Xipacane in Cabo Delgado, the guerrillas completely annihilated the defending enemy and seized one mortar, one heavy machine gun, three light machine guns, sixteen rifles, three transmitters, and one receiver.

In West Africa's "Portuguese" Guinea, while continuing to strike at the Portuguese colonial troops besieged in the south and north, the patriotic armed forces have intensified their offensive against the enemy strongholds in the east. Since February, the patriotic armed forces have repeatedly attacked the main enemy positions in the eastern region. In a battle near the village of Bissau, they killed eighteen Portuguese colonial troops and captured three alive.

The patriotic armed forces have also expanded their operations to the main stronghold of Portuguese colonialism in "Portuguese" Guinea—Bissau. It is reported that on February 28, a squad of the patriotic armed forces used mortars and rocket launchers to attack the Portuguese air base—Bissau Airport, located twelve kilometers from the city center of Bissau. They destroyed the control tower and three hangars, shot down two enemy aircraft, and damaged several more.

In Southwest Africa's Angola, the guerrilla forces, using the jungle as their base, have repeatedly attacked the Portuguese camps and patrols there. It is reported that in February, the Angolan guerrillas annihilated over a hundred enemies in the Kwanza region. In one day of fighting on February 16, they killed forty-six Portuguese colonial troops.

In Central Africa's Southern Rhodesia, the brave Zimbabwe African freedom fighters, undeterred by the brutal repression of the Smith colonial regime, have continued their armed struggle and grown stronger in the process. This year, they have established their own camps in the northern jungles and gradually expanded their guerrilla zones to the south. They have used landmines, ambushes, and other methods to strike at the Smith colonial troops, and often cleverly sabotaged enemy supply lines, punishing the heinous colonialists. Recently, the Zimbabwe freedom fighters have repeatedly launched attacks, and the broad masses of African people have also been using various forms of struggle to deal greater blows to the Smith colonial regime. It is reported that in recent battles, the Zimbabwe freedom fighters have achieved new victories, destroying two bombers and one helicopter of the Smith regime.

    据新华社三十一日讯在无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席的“枪杆子里面出政权”的光辉思想的鼓舞下，莫三鼻给、“葡属”几内亚、安哥拉和津巴布韦的革命人民，今年以来加紧打击美英帝国主义支持下的葡萄牙殖民军和南罗得西亚史密斯殖民政权，不断取得新的胜利。
    在东非的莫三鼻给，据报道，葡萄牙殖民军今年以来几乎天天都在挨揍。最近，游击队在当地人民的支持下，在北部的尼亚萨省和卡博德加多省对葡萄牙殖民军展开的一系列伏击和袭击中，歼灭敌人八十多人，摧毁敌军哨所两个，击落敌机一架，缴获大批武器弹药。消息说，仅在袭击葡萄牙在卡博德加多省的西帕基哨所时，就一举全歼那里的守敌，还缴获敌军迫击炮一门、重机枪一挺、轻机枪三挺、步枪十六支、发报机三台和收报机一台。
    在西非的“葡属”几内亚，爱国武装力量在继续打击南部和北部困守的葡萄牙殖民军的同时，加强了对殖民军盘踞的东部地区的攻势。二月份以来，爱国武装力量不断袭击在东部地区的主要敌军阵地。在比萨塞马村附近的一次战斗中，就打死葡萄牙殖民军十八人，活捉三人。
    爱国武装力量还把战斗扩展到葡萄牙殖民主义者在“葡属”几内亚的主要巢穴——比绍。据报道，二月二十八日，爱国武装力量的一支突击队，用迫击炮和火箭筒袭击了距比绍市中心十二公里的葡萄牙空军基地——比绍机场，摧毁了机场的塔台和三个飞机库，击毁敌机两架，击伤多架。
    在非洲西南部的安哥拉，游击队以丛林为基地，不断袭击在那里的葡萄牙兵营和巡逻队。据报道，二月份，安哥拉游击队在喀奔达地区歼灭敌人一百多人，在二月十六日一天的战斗中，就打死葡萄牙殖民军四十六人。
    在中非的南罗得西亚，英勇的津巴布韦非洲自由战士不顾史密斯殖民当局的残酷镇压，坚持开展武装斗争，并在斗争中不断壮大自己的力量。今年以来，他们在北部丛林中建立了自己的营地，并把游击区逐步向南部扩大。他们用埋地雷、伏击等方法打击史密斯殖民军，还经常巧妙地破坏敌人的交通线，惩办罪恶滔天的殖民主义者。最近以来，津巴布韦自由战士不断出击，广大非洲人民也正利用各种形式进行斗争，给史密斯殖民政权以更大的打击。消息说，津巴布韦自由战士在最近的战斗中，就取得了击毁史密斯当局的两架轰炸机和一架直升飞机的新胜利。（附图片）
