The revolutionary people of Japan are waging an increasingly intense anti-American, patriotic struggle, dealing a heavy blow to the aggressive policies of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries.

On the evening of April 1, more than 2,000 Japanese patriotic workers and students held a rally and demonstration against the construction of a new U.S. military field hospital. They engaged in a fierce six-hour battle with 3,000 armed police sent to suppress them.

The rally called on the Japanese people to persist in their struggle until they drive every last U.S. imperialist soldier out of Japan and Asia. Speakers at the rally exposed the U.S. imperialists' "peace talks" trickery and emphasized the need to remain highly vigilant against the cunning enemy.

After the rally, the patriotic masses, shouting slogans such as "U.S. imperialists out of Japan!" "Overthrow the Sato government!" and "Smash the field hospital!", marched to the U.S. military's Prince Camp for a demonstration.

The reactionary Sato government dispatched a large number of armed police, as well as more than a dozen armored cars and water cannons, to brutally suppress the demonstrators. The fascist police used large quantities of tear gas and wielded batons to violently beat the demonstrators. The bloody suppression by the reactionary police aroused the intense indignation of the broad masses of citizens. Tens of thousands of citizens strongly supported the demonstration. They, together with the workers and students, bravely surrounded the police and fiercely retaliated with sticks and stones, giving the reactionary police the punishment they deserved. The demonstrators also destroyed two police stations near the U.S. military camps and burned a patrol car. That day, the demonstrators continued to fight with the police until 1 a.m. before dispersing.

During the struggle against the reactionary police, a company employee named Enomoto Shigehisa was beaten by the police and suffered a severe head injury. He died at 10 a.m. on April 2. In addition, more than 300 demonstrators were injured by the police, and over 100 were illegally arrested. Currently, the Japanese people are turning their grief and indignation into strength, preparing to launch an even larger-scale anti-American struggle.

    赶走美帝国主义　打倒佐藤反动政府
    日本革命人民反美爱国斗争一浪高一浪
    两千多爱国工人学生继续示威反对美军新建野战医院同警察展开激烈搏斗
    新华社二日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本革命人民反对在东京北区开设美军野战医院的反美爱国斗争，正在一浪高一浪地向前发展，给予美日反动派的侵略政策以沉重打击。
    一日晚上，两千多名日本爱国工人和学生又举行大会和示威游行反对新建美军野战医院，并同前来镇压他们的三千名武装警察展开了长达六个小时的激烈搏斗。
    大会号召日本人民坚持斗争，直到把美帝国主义的一兵一卒都从日本和亚洲赶出去为止。参加大会的人在讲话中还揭露了美帝玩弄的“和谈”阴谋，强调对于狡猾的敌人必须保持高度的警惕。
    大会结束后，爱国群众高喊着“美帝从日本滚出去！”“打倒佐藤政府！”“粉碎野战医院！”等口号，到美军王子兵营前举行示威游行。
    佐藤反动政府出动大批武装警察以及十几辆装甲车和水龙车，残酷地镇压示威群众。法西斯警察一面使用大量的瓦斯弹，一面挥动警棍凶暴地殴打示威群众。反动警察的血腥镇压激起了广大市民的无比愤慨。数以万计的市民大力支援了示威队伍。他们同工人和学生一道勇敢地把警察重重包围起来，用木棍和石头猛烈地回击，给反动警察以应得的惩罚。示威群众还捣毁了两个美军兵营附近的警察派出所，烧了一辆巡逻车。这一天，示威群众一直和警察搏斗到深夜一点钟才散开。
    在同反动警察进行斗争的过程中，一位名叫榎本重元的公司职员被警察殴打，后脑受重伤，在二日上午十时壮烈牺牲。另外还有三百多名示威群众被警察打伤，有一百多人被非法逮捕。目前，日本人民正在化悲愤为力量，准备掀起更大规模的反美斗争。（附图片）
