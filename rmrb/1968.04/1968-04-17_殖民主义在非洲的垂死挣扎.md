Recently, the colonial regimes of South Africa, Southern Rhodesia, and Portugal, with the support of American and British imperialism, have been intensifying their military collusion. They aim to suppress the national independence struggles in southern Africa and are making military provocations and threats against nationalist countries like Zambia. This is a new, ferocious attack by the increasingly colluding white colonial regimes against the African people. The Chinese people strongly condemn the imperialists and colonialists for their barbaric suppression and aggression against the African people. We firmly support the armed struggles of the African people in Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Angola, and South Africa for national independence. We also firmly support the Zambian people in their just struggle to repel colonialist military provocations and defend their national independence.

The anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of the African people are deepening. With the flourishing armed struggles of the people of Mozambique and Angola, the people of Zimbabwe and South Africa are gradually taking up arms. The flames of anti-imperialist armed struggle are rapidly spreading across southern Africa, striking fear into the hearts of the dying colonial regimes. It is in this context that the white colonial regimes of South Africa, Southern Rhodesia, and Portugal are further tightening their collusion. They have secretly signed a "military agreement," forming a counter-revolutionary "holy alliance" to jointly suppress the burgeoning national independence movements in southern Africa and salvage the last bastions of colonialism in Africa. The South African white colonial regime plays a pivotal role in this counter-revolutionary "holy alliance."

The formation of the counter-revolutionary alliance of the remaining white colonial regimes in Africa has been consistently encouraged and supported by British imperialism. British imperialism uses both political deception and brutal suppression to try to build a "dam" in Southern Rhodesia to block the tide of national liberation movements and make a desperate struggle in Africa.

American imperialism has consistently supported the white colonial regimes of South Africa, Southern Rhodesia, and Portugal. It supplies these regimes with large quantities of weapons and oil to massacre the fighting African people. The bombs recently used by the Portuguese colonialists to provoke Zambia were supplied by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization led by the United States. American imperialism is deeply infiltrating southern Africa, plotting to replace the old colonialists. It also cunningly attempts to use the United Nations to bring the struggles of the African people under the orbit of American neo-colonialism, aiming to extinguish the flames of armed anti-imperialist struggles in southern Africa. American imperialism is the most treacherous and vicious enemy of the people of southern Africa fighting for national independence, and it is also the most treacherous and vicious enemy of the African people.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out, "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power. The counter-revolutionaries' desperate struggle against the revolutionary forces is also entirely for the purpose of maintaining their power."

The fact that the remaining white colonial regimes in Africa have formed a counter-revolutionary military alliance once again proves to the African people that the enemy will not disappear on its own. All old and new colonialists in Africa will not voluntarily withdraw from the historical stage. They are fighting to the death against the African people to maintain their shaky colonial rule. To achieve genuine national independence and liberation, the African people must use revolutionary violence against counter-revolutionary violence and thoroughly smash the evil rule of imperialism and old and new colonialism. We believe that, with the support of the people of the world and the people of various African countries, as long as the people of Zimbabwe, South Africa, and the Portuguese colonies unite, organize, and persist in the long and arduous armed struggle, they will definitely achieve the final victory in their national independence struggle.

    殖民主义在非洲的垂死挣扎
    本报评论员
    最近，南非、南罗得西亚和葡萄牙的殖民主义政权，在美英帝国主义的支持下，正在加紧军事勾结，妄图镇压非洲南部地区的民族独立斗争，并且向赞比亚等民族主义国家进行军事挑衅和战争威胁。这是日益加强勾结的白人殖民主义政权对非洲人民发起的新的猖狂进攻。中国人民强烈谴责帝国主义和殖民主义对非洲人民野蛮的镇压和侵略，坚决支持津巴布韦、莫三鼻给、安哥拉和南非等地非洲人民争取民族独立的武装斗争，坚决支持赞比亚人民反击殖民主义军事挑衅、维护民族独立的正义斗争。
    非洲人民反帝革命斗争正在深入发展，随着莫三鼻给、安哥拉人民武装斗争的蓬勃开展，津巴布韦和南非人民也逐步地走上武装斗争的道路。反帝武装斗争的烈火正向着非洲南部地区迅速蔓延，使得奄奄一息的殖民政权惊恐万状。正是在这样的形势下，南非、南罗得西亚和葡萄牙白人殖民政权，进一步加紧相互间的勾结。它们秘密签订“军事协议”，结成反革命的“神圣同盟”，企图共同镇压非洲南部地区蓬勃发展的民族独立运动，挽救将要彻底崩溃的殖民主义在非洲的最后阵地。南非白人殖民政权在这个反革命的“神圣同盟”中起着枢纽的作用。
    非洲残存的白人殖民主义政权反革命同盟的形成，是一贯得到英帝国主义的纵容和支持的。英帝国主义施用政治欺骗和残暴镇压的反革命两手，妄图在南罗得西亚建立一条堵住民族解放运动怒潮的“堤坝”，在非洲进行垂死的挣扎。
    美帝国主义一贯积极地支持南非、南罗得西亚和葡萄牙白人殖民政权。它向这些白人殖民政权供应大批军火和石油，以屠杀斗争中的非洲人民。葡萄牙殖民主义者最近对赞比亚进行军事挑衅使用的炸弹，也是以美国为首的北大西洋集团供应的。美帝国主义正在大力渗入非洲南部，阴谋取老殖民主义的地位而代之。它还心怀叵测地企图通过联合国，把非洲人民的斗争纳入美国新殖民主义的轨道，以扑灭非洲南部人民反帝武装斗争的烈火。美帝国主义是正在进行争取民族独立斗争的非洲南部人民的最阴险、最凶恶的敌人，也是非洲人民最阴险、最凶恶的敌人。
    我们伟大的导师毛主席指出，“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”
    非洲残存的白人殖民主义政权结成反革命军事同盟的事实，又一次向非洲人民证明，敌人是不会自行消灭的。一切新老殖民主义在非洲的侵略势力，也是决不会自行退出历史舞台的。它们拚死地同非洲人民斗争，就是为着维持摇摇欲坠的殖民统治。非洲人民要赢得真正的民族独立和解放，就必须用革命的暴力反对反革命的暴力，彻底打碎帝国主义和新老殖民主义的罪恶统治。我们相信，在全世界人民和非洲各国人民的支持下，只要津巴布韦人民、南非人民和葡属殖民地人民团结起来，组织起来，坚持长期艰巨的武装斗争，就一定能够取得民族独立斗争的最后胜利。
