The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the revolutionary masses under its leadership and the Kuomintang reactionaries. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. The establishment, consolidation, and perfection of the revolutionary committee of the No. 4 Cotton Mill in Shijiazhuang fully prove the correctness of this profound statement by the great leader Chairman Mao.

The revolutionary committee of the No. 4 Cotton Mill was established on May 10 last year. The broad masses of revolutionary workers, revolutionary cadres, and Red Guards were overjoyed, regarding it as a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in the No. 4 Cotton Mill. However, a small handful of traitors, spies, and stubborn capitalist-roaders, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists within the mill were furious and terrified. They gathered together, using all sorts of tricks and schemes, attempting to overthrow this newly established revolutionary committee.

Faced with such a sharp, complex, and serious class struggle, what should we do?

We studied Chairman Mao's instructions and realized that all revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing and consolidating power. Defending the newly established revolutionary committee is to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the ironclad socialist state. We clearly expressed our resolute support for the newly established revolutionary committee.

The great teacher Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolutionary war is a war of the masses; it can be waged only by mobilizing the masses and relying on them." Together with the comrades of the revolutionary committee, we organized workers to study and apply Chairman Mao's works and the latest instructions, focusing on learning the viewpoint of class and class struggle. We used Mao Zedong Thought to analyze the new trends, situations, and problems of class struggle in the city, the mill, and the workshops. This educated everyone to see through the complicated phenomena and recognize the essence of class struggle. In July last year, the number of workers taking sick leave from key production posts suddenly increased in some workshops. What was the reason? Some blamed the doctors for issuing too many sick leaves; others thought the weather was abnormal. Together with the comrades of the revolutionary committee, we guided everyone to analyze from the viewpoint of class and class struggle: Why were a small handful of spies, traitors, and stubborn capitalist-roaders in the mill particularly happy about someone taking sick leave? Why were there so many people taking sick leave from key production posts? After investigation, it was found that a small handful of capitalist-roaders in the mill were instigating workers to leave their production posts behind the scenes, spreading rumors such as: "No production, same pay, not a penny less." They attempted to disrupt production, disrupt the Cultural Revolution, and put pressure on the newly established revolutionary committee. The living facts made everyone realize: Taking sick leave is just a phenomenon; behind this phenomenon, there is a serious class struggle. The workers said: "With Mao Zedong Thought in command, class struggle can be seen clearly; without Mao Zedong Thought, serious class struggle cannot be seen or felt, and one will fall into the trap of the class enemy." After the class enemy's plot was exposed, some deceived masses quickly awakened and returned to the workshops to continue production.

In September and October last year, after the open plot of a small handful of capitalist-roaders in the mill to sabotage the revolutionary committee was smashed, they launched sugar-coated bullets, attempting to pull and corrupt workers, especially pulling and corrupting worker representatives in the revolutionary committee, trying to split and disintegrate the revolutionary committee. They said things like: "You are the renowned rebels"; "In the future, we will definitely follow you," and used methods like treating them to meals to attempt to pull the cadres of the revolutionary committee and split the revolutionary committee. However, as soon as they showed their heads, they were discovered by the workers. The workers reported these situations to the revolutionary committee and pointed out that this was a new trend of class struggle in the new situation. The revolutionary committee immediately took corresponding measures and powerfully smashed the class enemy's new plot.

Defending the newly established revolutionary committee has become a voluntary revolutionary action of the broad masses of workers and cadres, who expose and criticize the class enemy's plots to sabotage the revolutionary committee at any time; many workers have engaged in a head-on struggle with the class enemy, making the class enemy's rumors and sabotage activities become "rats crossing the street, everyone shouts to beat them."

The great teacher Chairman Mao instructs us that this struggle is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the revolutionary masses under its leadership and the Kuomintang reactionaries. The class enemies in the mill will never be willing to fail and will make various struggles. All the workers in the mill are determined to maintain high vigilance, be ready to smash the class enemy's various sabotage plots at any time, closely follow Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, and swear to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

    坚决粉碎阶级敌人的各种破坏阴谋
    解放军某部驻石家庄国棉四厂毛泽东思想宣传队
    伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地指出：无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。石家庄市国棉四厂革命委员会的成立、巩固和健全的过程，充分证明了伟大领袖毛主席的这一英明论断。
    国棉四厂革命委员会是在去年五月十日成立的。对于这个厂革命委员会的成立，广大革命工人、革命干部和红卫兵小将感到欢欣鼓舞，认为这是毛主席革命路线在国棉四厂的一个重大胜利。而厂内一小撮叛徒、特务和顽固不化的走资派、地富反坏右分子等则恨得要死，怕得要命，他们纠集一起，使尽种种阴谋诡计，妄图颠覆这个新生的革命委员会。
    面对这样尖锐、复杂、严重的阶级斗争怎么办？
    我们学习了毛主席的指示，认识到世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。保卫新生的革命委员会，就是保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，保卫社会主义的铁打江山。我们旗帜鲜明地表示坚决支持新生的革命委员会。
    伟大导师毛主席教导说：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争”。我们和革命委员会的同志一道，组织工人活学活用毛主席著作和最新指示，着重学习阶级和阶级斗争的观点，用毛泽东思想分析本市、本厂、本车间阶级斗争的新动向，新情况，新问题，教育大家透过纷纭复杂的现象，认识阶级斗争的本质。去年七月份，有些车间的关键性生产岗位请病假的人突然增多，这是什么原因，有人埋怨医生开假条太松了；有人认为气候不正常。我们同革委会的同志一起，引导大家用阶级和阶级斗争的观点来分析：为什么厂内一小撮特务、叛徒和顽固不化的走资派对有人请病假特别高兴？为什么关键性生产岗位请病假的人特别多？经过调查，发现原来是厂内一小撮走资派在背后煽动工人脱离生产岗位，胡说什么：“不生产照样拿钱，一分也少不了。”企图破坏生产，破坏文化大革命，对新生的革命委员会施加压力。活生生的事实，使大家认识到：请病假只是现象，在这一现象后面，隐藏着一场严重的阶级斗争。工人们说：“毛泽东思想挂了帅，阶级斗争就看得清，离开了毛泽东思想，对严重的阶级斗争就看不见、摸不着，就会上阶级敌人的当。”阶级敌人的阴谋一经揭穿以后，一些受蒙蔽的群众很快觉悟过来，纷纷回车间坚持生产。
    去年九、十月份，厂内一小撮走资派公开破坏革命委员会的阴谋被粉碎以后，又施放糖衣炮弹，拉拢、腐蚀工人，特别拉拢、腐蚀革命委员会中的工人代表，妄图分化瓦解革命委员会，说什么：“你们是响当当的造反派”；“以后坚决跟你们走”，还用请客吃饭等等手法，企图拉拢革命委员会干部，分裂革命委员会。可是，当他们刚露头的时候，就被工人发觉了，工人把这些情况反映给革命委员会，并提出这是在新的情况下阶级斗争的新动向。革命委员会立即采取了相应的措施，有力地粉碎了阶级敌人的新阴谋。
    保卫新生的革命委员会，成为广大工人和干部自觉的革命行动，随时揭发、批判阶级敌人破坏革命委员会的阴谋；许多工人和阶级敌人进行了针锋相对的斗争，使阶级敌人的造谣、破坏活动，成为“老鼠过街，人人喊打”。
    伟大导师毛主席指示我们，这场斗争是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续。厂里的阶级敌人，绝不会甘心失败，还会作种种挣扎。全厂工人决心保持高度警惕，随时准备粉碎阶级敌人的各种阴谋破坏活动，紧跟毛主席的战略部署，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
