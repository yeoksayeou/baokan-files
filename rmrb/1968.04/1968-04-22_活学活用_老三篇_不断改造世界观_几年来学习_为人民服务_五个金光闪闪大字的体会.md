"The 'Three Articles' are not just for soldiers to study; cadres should also study them. The 'Three Articles' are the easiest to read, but it is not easy to truly apply them. We should study the 'Three Articles' as our guiding principles. Everyone at every level should study them. Study them and apply them to promote ideological revolutionization."

Studying and Applying the "Three Articles" to Continuously Transform One's Worldview
— Reflections on Studying the Five Radiant Characters "Serve the People" Over the Past Few Years
Representative of the Active Learners of Mao Zedong Thought in the Wuhan Military Region, Deputy Platoon Leader of a Certain Unit, Zhou Shuping

	Use a completely thorough measure to find gaps,
	Establish a brave, fearless revolutionary spirit

	What is the purpose of a person's life? Different classes have different answers. Our great teacher Chairman Mao, in the "Three Articles," answered this question with five radiant characters: "Serve the People." The phrase "Serve the People" consists of only five characters, but for a revolutionary soldier to internalize these five characters as his soul and consciously use them as the guideline for all his words and deeds is a lifelong endeavor and a lifelong goal. Over the twelve years since I joined the army, especially in the past few years, I have mainly studied these five characters from Chairman Mao's works. However, even now, I have not fully mastered them. I feel that the "Three Articles" must be studied every day, every moment, and forever, studied for a lifetime.

	I was born in a poor peasant family in Xuanhan County, Sichuan Province. In that old society where people were exploited, my family had been laborers for generations, always toiling and always hungry. In 1949, Chairman Mao liberated my hometown, and I, who had been oppressed like a plant under a stone, saw the light of day for the first time. Chairman Mao's sunlight shone into my heart. In 1956, I joined the army with a heart full of gratitude. At that time, I had only one thought: Chairman Mao saved me, and if I do not work hard, I will not be worthy of Chairman Mao. I thought that as long as I worked hard, I would be serving the people. Whether it was day or night, I was always at the forefront, always taking the lead. At that time, there was still a significant "self" in my thoughts, and I often considered problems from the perspective of "me."

	In 1960, following the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin, I began to seriously study Chairman Mao's works. The brilliant "Three Articles" opened my mind like a master key, making me begin to understand: having a sense of gratitude and a spirit of hard work is not enough; one must establish a completely thorough spirit of serving the people. However, in those years, I had not yet truly understood the meaning of completely thorough service to the people. I thought that as long as I did not seek personal fame and gain, did not calculate personal losses and gains, worked diligently, and toiled hard, I would be completely thorough in serving the people. Later, an incident touched my soul, and my understanding underwent a significant change. It was in the spring of 1964. Once, while helping the second platoon's third squad with training, a heavy snowstorm had just passed, and the snow on the ground was over a foot deep. During the exercise, the new soldier Zhou Ganceng had just ducked down behind a snow mound when he fell into a well over two meters deep along with his gun. At that time, I was a few meters away from him and thought he had fallen into a single-person shelter or a pit. I ran up to him, braced myself with my arms on the snow, and my body fell down, only to discover that it was actually a water well. My heart fluttered for a moment. At that time, other comrades rushed over, tied their belts together, and lowered them down. I passed the belts to Zhou Ganceng and told him to step on my shoulders. I exerted all my strength to push him up and saved him. That night, I studied the "Three Articles" and compared myself to the shining examples of Zhang Side and Norman Bethune. I realized that my momentary hesitation during the rescue revealed the gap between me and these two great communist warriors, exposing my lack of firmness in the face of unexpected danger.

	From this, I further understood a truth: whether a person is completely thorough in serving the people or half-hearted, whether he is a true revolutionary soldier or a coward who fears death, is not only shown by whether he calculates personal losses and gains in general situations but more importantly by whether he is truly steadfast when the people need him to sacrifice his life. A true revolutionary soldier's everything, including his life, belongs to the Party and the people. He should live for the people and die for the people. For a revolutionary soldier, this brave, fearless spirit of self-sacrifice is even more necessary. When the people need you to sacrifice your life, you should step forward without hesitation. This is the true meaning of completely thorough service to the people. I resolved to strive towards this goal.

	In times of peace, strive to overcome selfishness, so as to be completely thorough in serving the people in critical moments

	The new target for ideological transformation was clear, and the high standard of completely thorough service to the people was found. I resolved to think and act for the people in actual struggles. In life-or-death situations, I should remain calm and fearless, offering my life to the people.

	How can one achieve this? My experience is: one must always, in every matter and situation, use the completely selfless great communist ideology in the "Three Articles" as the highest standard, use the shining examples of Zhang Side, Norman Bethune, and the "Old Man Moving Mountains" as a mirror. One must not only practice bravely in times of peace, train diligently, but also in critical moments, demand more of oneself, find more faults, and identify more gaps and problems in one's thoughts. Because only those who are completely thorough in living for the people can die for the people without hesitation; only those who have high ideological awareness in times of peace can pass the test in critical moments.

	One day, I led the engineering platoon in a detonation operation. When it was the new soldier Li Sichen's turn, due to his nervousness, he dropped the lit detonator beside him. At that moment, my mind flashed: quickly save the class brother, don't let an accident happen. I quickly rushed forward, grabbed the detonator, and threw it out. The detonator exploded in mid-air, preventing an injury accident. Back home, I opened the "Three Articles" and compared myself to the thought of "don't let an accident happen." I found the gap in my fear of accidents, which contained both concern for others and selfishness. Because I was the leader of the operation, if an accident happened, I would be responsible. This showed that the proletarian view of life and death of "living for the people and dying for the people" had not become my soul, and I had not achieved "extreme enthusiasm for comrades and the people." The four characters "completely" and "thoroughly" had not become my conscious actions. Therefore, in times of peace, I demanded more of myself with higher standards and launched an attack on the "self."

	The thorn of selfishness is hidden in one's thoughts. If one does not use the "thought microscope" of completely thorough service to the people to observe, one often cannot find it. Therefore, during swimming training in the unit, during supporting local drought relief by digging wells, during participating in the "Four Cleanups" movement, whether in general situations or critical moments, I used the "Three Articles" as a weapon to strictly demand of myself, find more faults, and resolutely remove the thorn of selfishness. Because I had fought against selfishness, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "dying for the people is a worthy death," in several dangerous moments, I disregarded my own life and death, saving class brothers five times.

	Through several years of repeated struggles and practices, I deeply understood: establishing the proletarian view of life and death of "living for the revolution and dying for the revolution" is a lifelong endeavor, living a lifetime, practicing a lifetime, and establishing it a lifetime. However, as a proletarian soldier, one must, with the spirit of "seizing the day," use the fire of the "Three Articles" to forge oneself into a piece of "high-quality steel" needed by the Party and the people as soon as possible.

	On the evening of August 22, 1966, it was windy and raining lightly, and one could not see anything beyond a meter. I led two platoons of soldiers in nighttime live grenade throwing training. When it was the new soldier Hou Changhui's turn to throw, the sky darkened further, and he threw the second grenade. Due to nervousness, he did not hold the grenade tightly, and because he used too much force, he threw the grenade to his right rear. At that time, nine comrades from the fourth platoon and the medic, clerk, etc., were all in the trench on Hou Changhui's right side, exposing half of their bodies. I realized that twelve class brothers were facing life-threatening danger, so I rushed forward and found the grenade right in front of me. I shouted, "Take cover!" and kicked the grenade with all my might, trying to kick it into a pit on the left. Due to the darkness, I could not see clearly, and the grenade did not move, but instead kicked closer to Hou Changhui. At that critical moment, Chairman Mao's teaching of "dying for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai" inspired and encouraged me. I resolved to sacrifice myself to protect the twelve class brothers. So, I rushed forward and pushed Hou Changhui over the embankment with one hand, and then pounced on the grenade. Just as my left leg was about to touch the grenade, it exploded! After that, I knew nothing. When I woke up, I was already in a hospital bed, with my left calf shattered and my whole body severely injured. The first question in my mind was whether the class brothers were safe. When I learned that the medic and the deputy of the fourth platoon were lightly injured, I felt that I had not fulfilled my responsibility. I thought, if I had pounced a second earlier, the twelve class brothers might have been safe.

	From Chairman Mao's teachings on life and death, I understood that the value of life does not depend on life itself but on for whom one lives and dies. Only by dedicating one's life completely thorough to the great cause of serving the people can life be valuable. For a proletarian revolutionary soldier who completely thorough serves the people, the length of his life is not measured by age. Like the shining examples personally set by Chairman Mao for us, such as Zhang Side, Norman Bethune, Liu Huilan, Lei Feng, and other martyrs, some of them only lived for a few decades, but their spirits will forever educate and inspire later revolutionaries. They will forever live in the hearts of millions of revolutionary people.

	The completely thorough highest standard is
	Unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line

	When the grenade exploded, I had over a hundred shrapnel pieces in my body, forty-five injuries, and my left calf was shattered. Thanks to the Party and Chairman Mao's meticulous care and the medical staff's rescue efforts, I gained a second life. Without Chairman Mao, I would have nothing! I secretly resolved: as long as I am alive, I must completely thorough serve the people. Although I lost a leg, I still have another leg, and with this leg, I must follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and be forever loyal to Chairman Mao, letting the character "loyalty" guide all my actions. Therefore, during the treatment process, I always tried to follow Chairman Mao's teachings on pain, use the three shining examples to inspire myself, and strive to recover quickly, so that I could dedicate my future life completely thorough to the people.

	During my treatment, the great proletarian cultural revolution mass movement arose nationwide. One day, I hobbled with a cane to visit the Red Guards' exhibition of achievements and saw the long-term stubborn resistance of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party against Chairman Mao, attempting to change the sky and restore the old order. My heart was unsettled for a long time! I thought: if it were not for Chairman Mao personally initiating and leading this unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, our Party and country would change color in a few years or decades, and we would suffer again. So, I resolved to follow Chairman Mao closely in this unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, even if I am in the hospital, my thoughts must not "live in the hospital"! When needed, I must use my blood to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

	In November 1966, I was transferred to a certain hospital for treatment. Here, I investigated the situation of the intense struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines. Following Chairman Mao's teaching of "either the east wind prevails over the west wind, or the west wind prevails over the east wind, there is no room for compromise on the line issue," I clearly supported the proletarian revolutionary faction in the hospital.

	However, due to my lack of high awareness of line struggle, I did not fully understand Chairman Mao's theory, line, policy, and methods of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and I did not promptly expose those who waved the red flag to oppose the red flag. So, I brought this problem back to repeatedly study the "Three Articles" and found that I had not fully grasped the essence. In the past, under the nurturing of the "Three Articles," I progressed from generally understanding service to the people to understanding that one must completely thorough serve the people. I focused more on the characters "live" and "die," but I did not deeply understand what "liberating the people" and "the people's interests" meant. However, these are the fundamental issues of the revolutionary direction, road, and line. At that time, I deeply understood: if a person's awareness of line struggle is not high, even if he sacrifices his life, he cannot be said to completely thorough serve the people. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the only correct line for the Chinese and world people's revolution. Chairman Mao's thoughts fully reflect the people's fundamental interests. Loyalty to Chairman Mao is loyalty to the people; completely thorough service to the people means completely thorough loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Otherwise, it will go against the people's fundamental interests, not only failing to completely thorough serve the people but may even lead to mistakes.

	Reviewing the struggles and practices of the past few years, especially the struggles and practices of the past two years of the cultural revolution, I have gained many experiences and lessons in ideological transformation. In summary, one must take unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line as the highest standard for establishing a completely thorough proletarian worldview and strive to transform oneself. Only in this way can one become a true proletarian revolutionary soldier. Chairman Mao's brilliant works, the "Three Articles," are the guiding light leading us to continuously climb this peak. Only by studying and applying the "Three Articles" can one have a clear mind, correct direction, bright eyes, and firm stance. The "Three Articles" are always new when studied; they have boundless and profound ideological content. With the development of the times, insisting on learning and applying them in struggles can gradually deepen one's understanding. In short, the "Three Articles" will forever be our guiding principle for ideological revolutionization. I will use the "Three Articles" as a weapon to constantly ignite a revolution in the depths of my soul, thoroughly transform my worldview, completely thorough serve the people, and achieve new victories in seizing the comprehensive victory of the proletarian cultural revolution.

    “老三篇”不但战士要学，干部也要学。“老三篇”最容易读，真正做到就不容易了。要把“老三篇”作为座右铭来学。哪一级都要学。学了就要用，搞好思想革命化。
    活学活用“老三篇”　不断改造世界观
    ——几年来学习“为人民服务”五个金光闪闪大字的体会
    武汉部队活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子代表大会代表、某部副连长　周述平
          用完全彻底的尺子找差距，
    树立勇敢、不怕死的革命精神
    一个人活着，到底为的啥？不同的阶级有不同的回答。我们的伟大导师毛主席在“老三篇”中，用五个金光闪闪的大字作了回答：“为人民服务”。“为人民服务”一共五个字，可是，一个革命战士要把这五个字化为自己的灵魂，自觉地把它作为一切言行的准则，是一辈子的事，是终身奋斗的目标。我参军十二年来，特别是最近几年来，学习毛主席著作，主要就是学了这五个字，可是，直到现在也没有完全学好。我觉得“老三篇”必须时时学，天天学，永远学，学一辈子。
    我出生在四川省宣汉县一个贫农的家里。在那吃人的旧社会，我家辈辈长工辈辈苦，年年种地年年饥。一九四九年，毛主席解放了我的家乡，我这个压在石头底下的苦苗苗，第一次见到了天日，毛主席的阳光照到了我的心上。一九五六年，我就是抱着报恩的思想入伍的。那时我只有一个想法：毛主席救了我，不好好干就对不住毛主席。我以为只要好好干就是为人民服务。无论白天黑夜，我处处跑在前，事事抢着干。这时，思想里面还有一个不小的“私”字，考虑问题还常常离不开一个“我”字。
    一九六○年，我按照林副主席的指示，开始认真地学习毛主席著作。光辉的“老三篇”象一把万能的钥匙打开了我的心窍，使我开始认识到：光有报恩思想和埋头苦干的精神，还是很不够的，必须树立完全彻底为人民服务的思想。但是那几年，我还没有真正理解完全彻底为人民服务的意义，以为只要不为个人名利，不计较个人得失，工作中兢兢业业，埋头苦干，就是完全彻底地为人民服务了。后来遇到了一件事，触动了我的灵魂，我的认识起了一个很大的变化。那是一九六四年春天，有一次帮助二连三班搞训练，一场大风雪刚过，平地里雪厚一尺多。在演习过程中，新战士周干成刚对着前面一个雪包卧倒下去，便连人带枪掉到两丈多深的井里去了。当时，我离他两三米远，还以为他掉到单人掩体或者是坑里了。我跑上前去，两臂撑着雪地，身子落了下去，才发现原来是个水井，心里不觉一动。这时，其他同志赶来了，把腰带一根根结起放下来，我把带子递给周干成，叫他踩着我的肩膀，我使劲往上顶，把他救了上来。晚上我学习“老三篇”，对照张思德、白求恩的光辉形象，想想我自己白天思想里的那一动，一下子找出了我和张思德、白求恩两个伟大的共产主义战士间的思想差距，暴露出我在抢救战友时，一旦遇到意外的危险，还不够坚定。
    从这里，我进一步认识到一个道理：一个人是完全彻底地为人民服务，还是半心半意地为人民服务，是真正的革命战士，还是贪生怕死的懦夫，不仅要看在一般情况下是否计较个人得失，更重要的是看在人民需要你献出生命的时候，是不是真正过得硬。一个真正的革命战士，他的一切，包括他的生命，都是属于党的，属于人民的，他应该为人民而生，为人民而死。对于革命战士来说，更需要这种勇敢不怕死的革命献身精神。当人民需要你牺牲生命时，能毫不犹豫地挺身而出，这才是真正的完全彻底为人民服务。我决心朝着这个目标努力前进。
          平时狠斗私心，关键时刻才能
    完全彻底为人民服务
    思想改造的新目标明确了，完全彻底为人民服务的高标准找到了。我决心在实际斗争中心往为人民服务上想，劲往为人民服务上使。在生死关头要面不改色心不跳，捧出生命献人民。
    怎样才能做到这一点呢？我的体会是：必须时时、事事、处处以“老三篇”中完全无私的伟大共产主义思想为最高标准，以张思德、白求恩、“老愚公”这三个光辉形象为镜子，既要在平时勇于实践，刻苦锻炼，更要在关键时刻严要求，多“挑刺”，多找思想上的差距和毛病。因为只有完全彻底为人民而生的人，才能毫不犹豫地为人民去死；只有平时思想觉悟高，才能在关键时刻经得住考验。
    一天，我带工兵排搞爆破点火作业。轮到新战士李思谦作业时，由于他过于紧张，将点燃的雷管掉在身边。这时，我脑子里一闪：快抢救阶级兄弟，可别发生事故。我急忙一个箭步冲了上去，抓起雷管就往外扔，雷管在空中爆炸了，避免了一场炸伤事故。回到家里，我打开“老三篇”一对照，就从“不要发生事故”这个一闪念上找出了差距。怕出事故的思想里既有关心他人的成份，也包含着私心。因为我是领导作业的，出了事故我要负责任。这说明，“为人民而生，为人民而死”的无产阶级生死观还没有化为自己的灵魂，没有做到“对同志对人民的极端的热忱”，“完全”“彻底”这四个字还没有变成我的自觉行动。因此，在平时我就更加严格地用高标准要求自己，向“私”字打进攻战。
      “私”字的刺，扎在自己的思想里，如果不用完全彻底为人民服务的“思想显微镜”去观察，常常还找不到它。于是，我在部队进行游泳训练中，在支援地方抗旱挖井中，在参加“四清”运动中，无论是一般情况还是关键时刻，都以“老三篇”为武器，去严格要求，多挑刺，下定决心把“私”字的刺挑出来。由于狠斗了“私”字，遵照毛主席的“为人民而死，就是死得其所”的教导，在几次危险的关头，我都置个人生死于不顾，先后五次下水抢救了阶级兄弟。
    经过几年来的反反复复的斗争实践，使我深深认识到：“为革命而生，为革命而死”的无产阶级生死观的树立是一辈子的事，活一辈子，实践一辈子，树一辈子；但是，作为一个无产阶级战士来说，必须以
  “只争朝夕”的精神，用“老三篇”的烈火把自己尽快地冶炼成一块党和人民需要的“优质钢”。
    一九六六年八月二十二日晚，刮着小风，下着细雨，一米以外就什么也看不清了。我带着两个排的战士在野外进行夜间手榴弹实弹投掷训练。轮到新战士侯长会投弹时，天更黑了，他投第二颗时，由于心情紧张，握弹不紧，加上用力过猛，把手榴弹甩到了自己的右后方。这时，四班九个同志和卫生员、文书等，都在侯长会右边三米多远的堑壕里，露着半截身子。我意识到，十二名阶级兄弟面临着生命的危险，就飞步上前，发现手榴弹就在跟前，大喊：“注意隐蔽！”便朝手榴弹猛踢一脚，想把手榴弹踢到左边一个土坑里去。由于天黑，看不清，手榴弹没有踢开，相反却踢得离侯长会更近了。这时，侯长会还呆呆地站在那里。在这千钧一发之际，毛主席“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重”的教导，鼓舞着我，激励着我，我决心牺牲自己，保护十二位阶级兄弟。于是，我一个箭步窜上去，一掌把侯长会推过土坎，就向手榴弹猛扑过去。就在我左腿刚接近手榴弹的时候，手榴弹爆炸了！这以后，我就什么也不知道了。当我苏醒过来时，已经躺在病床上，左小腿被炸坏了，全身都负了重伤。我脑子里第一个出现的问题，就是阶级兄弟的安全是否保住了。当我知道卫生员和四班副负了轻伤时，感到自己还没有尽到责任。我想，当时如果早一秒钟扑过去，就可能使十二位阶级兄弟都安全无恙。
    从毛主席关于对待生和死的教导中，我认识到，生命是否可贵，绝不取决于生命本身，而取决于为谁而生，为谁而死。只有把自己的生命完全彻底地贡献给为人民服务的伟大事业，生命才是可贵的。对于一个完全彻底为人民服务的无产阶级革命战士来说，他的生命的长短是不能用年龄来计算的。象毛主席亲手给我们树立起来的光辉榜样张思德、白求恩、刘胡兰、雷锋等烈士，有的虽然只活了十几岁、二十几岁……但是，他们的精神永远在教育、激励着革命后来人，他们永远活在亿万革命人民的心中。
          完全彻底的最高标准是
      无限忠于毛主席的革命路线
    当手榴弹爆炸时，我身上中弹片一百二十多片，负伤四十五处，左小腿被炸成粉碎性骨折。由于党和毛主席给了我无微不至的关怀，医护人员的奋力抢救，使我获得了第二次生命。没有毛主席就没有我的一切！我暗暗下定决心：活着，就更要完全彻底为人民服务。我虽然失去了一条腿，但还有另一条腿，就是这一条腿，也要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，永远忠于毛主席，让忠字指挥我的一切行动。因此，在治疗过程中，我总是努力按毛主席的教导对待伤痛，用三个光辉形象鼓舞自己，力争早日伤愈，好把未来的生命完全彻底献给人民。
    就在我治疗期间，伟大的无产阶级文化大革命群众运动在全国兴起了。一天，我拄着拐杖去参观红卫兵战绩展览，看到混进党内一小撮走资派长期以来顽固地对抗毛主席，妄图变天复辟的罪行，我的心情久久不能平静！我想：要不是毛主席他老人家亲自发动和领导这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，我们的党和国家少则几年、十几年，多则几十年，就要改变颜色，我们就要吃二遍苦。于是，我下定决心，一定要在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，紧跟毛主席，人住院，思想绝不能“住院”！需要时，我要用鲜血保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    一九六六年十一月，我被转到某医院治疗。在这里，我调查了两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线激烈斗争的情况，按照毛主席“不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风，在路线问题上没有调和的余地”的教导，我旗帜鲜明地支持了医院的无产阶级革命派。
    但是，由于自己缺乏高度的路线斗争觉悟，对毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策不很理解，对某些人打着“红旗”反红旗没有及时识破。于是，我就带着这个问题又反复学习了“老三篇”，发觉过去我并没有完全抓住它的根本。过去，我在“老三篇”的抚育下，从一般地懂得为人民服务，提高到懂得要完全彻底为人民服务，开始只在“生”“死”二字上看得多，想得多，而对什么叫“解放人民”、“人民的利益”理解不深。但是，正是这些问题，才是革命的根本方向问题、道路问题和路线问题。这时，我深深认识到：一个人如果路线斗争觉悟不高，就是舍生忘死，也不能算是完全彻底为人民服务。毛主席的无产阶级革命路线是中国人民和世界人民进行革命唯一正确的路线。毛主席的思想集中地反映了人民的根本利益。忠于毛主席就是忠于人民；完全彻底为人民服务，就要完全彻底忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。否则，就会违背人民的根本利益，不仅不能完全彻底为人民服务，相反还会犯错误。
    回顾几年来的斗争实践，特别是文化大革命两年来的斗争实践，在思想改造上，我的体会、教训是不少的，集中到一点，就是必须把无限忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线，作为树立完全彻底为人民服务的无产阶级世界观的最高标准，努力改造自己。这样，才能做一名真正的无产阶级革命战士。毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”，是指引我们朝着这个高峰不断攀登的指路明灯。活学活用“老三篇”，才能头脑清醒，方向端正，心明眼亮，立场坚定。“老三篇”常学常新，它有无比丰富、无比深刻的思想内容。随着时代的发展，坚持在斗争中学，在斗争中用，就能逐渐加深理解。总之一句话，“老三篇”永远是我们思想革命化的座右铭。我要以“老三篇”为武器，经常地在灵魂深处爆发革命，彻底改造世界观，完全彻底为人民服务，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利中立新功。
