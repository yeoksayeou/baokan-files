Following the unprecedented scale of the American black people's struggle against violence, there has recently been a major strike by American telecommunications workers, the likes of which have not been seen in over twenty years. This is another manifestation of the sharpening class contradictions within the United States and the increasing instability of the reactionary rule of the American monopoly bourgeoisie.

Over the past year, American copper miners, steel workers, railroad workers, dock workers, sanitation workers, public school teachers, and others have been staging large-scale strikes one after another, dealing a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialism which is beset with difficulties both at home and abroad.

The surge in the American workers' movement is the inevitable result of U.S. imperialism's intensified reactionary policies at home and abroad. In recent years, U.S. imperialism, in order to maintain its reactionary rule and ensure super-profits for the monopoly bourgeoisie, has been conducting aggression everywhere and crazily expanding the Vietnam War. At the same time, it has intensified the exploitation and oppression of the broad masses of laboring people at home. The American working class and laboring people not only have their relatives forced to become cannon fodder in the U.S. imperialist's Vietnam War, but also, due to inflation, increased taxes, and rising prices, their real wages are declining, and their living conditions are worsening. With the stagnation of the American economy, the number of unemployed workers is increasing. The deepening impoverishment of the American working class and laboring people is driving more and more American workers and laboring people to rise up and resolutely resist the oppression of the American monopoly bourgeoisie.

The broad masses of American blacks and the working class and laboring people among American whites are like fruits on the same vine; they are all objects of exploitation and oppression by the American monopoly bourgeoisie. The American monopoly bourgeoisie practices racial discrimination against blacks not only to exploit and oppress blacks but also to split the ranks of the American working class, making blacks a large reserve army of labor to force the laboring people among whites to endure the ruthless exploitation and oppression of monopoly capital. "The broad masses of American blacks and the broad laboring people among American whites have common interests and common goals in their struggle." The broad laboring people of America, including blacks and whites, will certainly, in their common struggle, increasingly recognize the truth pointed out by the great leader of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, and thus unite closely to launch a sustained and fierce attack on their common enemy, the American monopoly bourgeoisie.

Chairman Mao has pointed out to the American people: "The night is bound to end. The reactionary forces in the United States are now running into a dead end everywhere, showing that their days are numbered. The current situation where the enemy is strong and you are weak is only a temporary phenomenon; it will certainly change in the opposite direction." The broad masses of the American people, first and foremost the American working class and black masses, are becoming increasingly aware. They will certainly combine their struggle with the struggle of the people of the world against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, ultimately overthrow the criminal rule of the American monopoly bourgeoisie, and become the true masters of America.

    向共同的敌人发动猛攻
    紧接着规模空前的美国黑人抗暴斗争的风暴，最近又发生了一场二十多年没有过的美国电讯工人的大罢工。这是美国国内阶级矛盾尖锐化、美国垄断资产阶级的反动统治日益不稳的又一表现。
    去年以来，美国铜矿工人、钢铁工人、铁路工人、码头工人、清洁工人、公教人员等等，接连不断地举行大规模的罢工，给予内外交困的美帝国主义以沉重的打击。
    美国工人运动的高涨，是美帝国主义在国内外加紧推行反动政策的必然结果。近几年来，美帝国主义为了维持它的反动统治，保证垄断资产阶级获得超额利润，到处进行侵略，疯狂扩大侵越战争；与此同时，加紧剥削和压迫国内的广大劳动人民。美国工人阶级和广大劳动人民，不仅自己的亲人被迫充当美帝侵越战争的炮灰，而且由于通货膨胀，捐税增加，物价上涨，他们的实际工资节节下降，生活日益恶化。随着美国经济发展停滞，失业工人不断增加。美国工人阶级和劳动人民贫困化的加深，正在促使越来越多的美国工人和劳动人民起来对美国垄断资产阶级的压迫进行坚决的反抗。
    广大美国黑人同美国白人中的工人阶级和劳动人民，是一根藤上的瓜，都是美国垄断资产阶级剥削和压迫的对象。美国垄断资产阶级对黑人实行种族歧视，不仅是为了剥削和压迫黑人，也是为了分裂美国工人阶级的队伍，使黑人成为一支庞大的劳动后备军，来迫使白人中的劳动人民忍受垄断资本的残酷剥削和压迫。“美国广大黑人同美国白人中的广大劳动人民，有着共同的利益和共同的斗争目标。”包括黑人和白人的美国广大劳动人民，一定会在他们的共同斗争实践中，越来越认识到无产阶级伟大导师毛主席所指出的这个真理，从而紧密地团结起来，向着他们的共同敌人美国垄断资产阶级发动持久的猛烈的进攻。
    毛主席曾经向美国人民指出：“黑夜是有尽头的。美国反动势力现已到处碰壁，显示着他们的寿命不会很长了。你们那里目前敌强我弱这种形势，完全是暂时的现象，它一定会向相反的方向起变化。”美国广大人民，首先是美国的工人阶级和黑人群众，正在日益觉醒。他们必将把他们的斗争同全世界人民反对美帝国主义及其帮凶们的斗争结合起来，最终推翻美国垄断资产阶级的罪恶统治，使自己成为美国的真正的主人。
