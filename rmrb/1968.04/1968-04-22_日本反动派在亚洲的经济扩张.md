Under the patronage of U.S. imperialism, the malignant expansion of Japanese monopoly capital in recent years has accelerated its external aggression, particularly in the vast region from South Korea to Southeast Asia, where it is frenziedly carrying out the nefarious activities of neo-colonialism. Recently, under the orders of U.S. imperialism, the Sato government of Japan convened the so-called "Southeast Asia Development Ministers' Conference." The Japanese reactionaries, who act as the henchmen of U.S. imperialism's aggression, are increasingly accelerating their steps of aggression and expansion into Southeast Asia.

	Competing for the Southeast Asian market, intensifying the export of goods and capital

	The Japanese monopoly capital that re-emerged after World War II has been relentlessly infiltrating and expanding into various parts of Asia, vying with other colonial powers for the Southeast Asian market. In the past decade, the total import trade volume of the Southeast Asian region has increased by only 50%, while the import volume of Japanese goods has increased by an average of 20% per year. Japan has now become the second-largest exporter to this region.

	According to official Japanese materials, in recent years, in the foreign trade of many countries and regions in Asia, Japan has begun to rank first or second. For example, Japan's exports to South Korea accounted for 21% of South Korea's total imports in 1960, but by 1966, this had increased to 40%, surpassing the United States to become the largest. Japan's exports to Indonesia accounted for 18% of Indonesia's total imports in 1961, rising to 30% in 1966, making it the second-largest. In the Philippines, Japan's share of total imports increased from 26% in 1961 to 30% in 1966, also ranking second.

	The Japanese monopoly groups have been continuously increasing their capital exports to Southeast Asia. From the end of World War II to the end of 1966, Japan had exported over $4 billion in capital to Southeast Asia through various economic infiltration means. Of this, so-called "war reparations" and "economic cooperation" totaled $1.95 billion, investments amounted to approximately $500 million, and export deferred credit was about $1.5 billion. Especially since the establishment of the Sato government in 1964, in less than four years, the Japanese government has already implemented and announced foreign "economic aid" and other capital exports totaling $2.2 billion. In 1967, Japan's government funds for foreign "aid" increased by 40% compared to the previous year. All of this indicates that the Sato government's pace of external economic expansion is much faster than that of any other post-war Japanese government.

	Under the guise of "cooperation," the reality is plunder

	In its aggressive expansion into various parts of Southeast Asia, the Japanese reactionaries have raised the banner of overseas "economic cooperation" and sung the praises of "assisting in the development of Southeast Asia." However, no matter what banner or flowery words are used, they cannot cover up the bloody facts of Japanese reactionaries' frenzied exploitation, plunder, and control in the Southeast Asian region.

	Japanese bourgeois newspapers openly admit that the rich mineral and agricultural, forestry, and fishery resources of the Southeast Asian region are the objects of Japanese monopoly capital's desire. Currently, many important resources in Southeast Asia, including iron ore, copper ore, timber, and oil, have fallen to varying degrees into the hands of Japanese monopoly capital. All of Malaysia's exported iron sand, 80% of Sabah's exported timber, 80% of the Philippines' exported timber and copper ore, 70% of Thailand's exported corn, 30% of its rubber, and 30% of Indonesia's exported oil are all controlled by Japanese monopoly capital.

	Japan has a significant trade surplus with Southeast Asia every year. Over the past decade, it has earned $5.6 billion in foreign exchange through trade in the region.

	It is particularly noteworthy that in Japan's trade with Southeast Asia, the volume of arms exports is increasing. Last April, Sato boasted in the Diet that Japan could "export defensive weapons overseas," shouting that the prohibition of arms exports was "unfair." Japanese monopoly capital aims to reap greater profits from arms exports.

	Exploiting Southeast Asia's cheap labor is a major "stimulus" for Japanese capital exports. The Japanese magazine "Overseas Market" lusted after "the wages in Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Malaysia are half or even one-seventh of Japan's minimum wage." Many large Japanese monopoly companies have set up branches, assembly plants, and other factories overseas, using local cheap labor to process products and reap high profits.

	Japanese companies that have entered overseas have already occupied a considerable monopoly position in some places. For example, the Toyota Motor Company of Japan exports car parts to a company in South Korea, monopolizing the production of small cars. Japanese capital controls 80% of South Korea's shipbuilding industry and the entire synthetic resin industry. According to statistics at the end of November 1966, in South Korea's $720 million in foreign capital, Japan accounted for 30%, second only to the United States. South Korea has essentially become a dual colony of U.S. imperialism and Japanese militarism.

	Attempting to revive the old dream of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere"

	The increasingly rampant external expansion activities of the Japanese reactionaries are a direct support and collaboration with U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression and war in Asia, and are also an important aspect of their efforts to revive militarism. In recent years, while the Japanese reactionaries have been intensifying military buildup and war preparations at home, they have greatly strengthened their expansion and infiltration into the Southeast Asian region, attempting to establish an "Asian-Pacific Circle" with the United States as the backer and Japan as the core, stretching from South Korea in the north to Australia and New Zealand in the south, forming an anti-China encirclement. Why are the Japanese reactionaries so eager to cobble together an anti-China "Asian-Pacific Circle"? Their purposes are twofold. One is to closely collude and cooperate with U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism to intensify opposition to socialist China; at the same time, to "stabilize" the reactionary rule of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in various Asian countries and suppress the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asian countries. The other is to use "economic cooperation" as a pretext to intensify economic infiltration and control over the countries of Southeast Asia, to rebuild the sphere of influence of Japanese militarism in this region, and to foolishly dream of reviving the old "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."

	Recently, the Japanese ruling clique has been brazenly advocating the revival of militarism and external aggression. Some militarist leaders have openly incited that the Southeast Asian region is Japan's "lifeline," and Japan should extend the "sea line" to the Malacca Strait. An official of Japan's "Defense Agency" has boasted in a magazine that "as the next task, it is necessary to seriously consider" how Japan should "lead" the countries of the Asian-Pacific region and what contributions Japan should make to their defense. The Japanese reactionaries are also attempting to take advantage of the situation of British imperialism withdrawing its troops from east of the Suez Canal to become the heir to British imperialism's legacy in Asia, thereby expanding their sphere of influence. In recent times, the Japanese reactionaries have intensified their collusion with the Rahman-Lee Kuan Yew clique, which is a concrete manifestation of this.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "When we say 'imperialism is very ferocious,' we mean that its nature is unchangeable. Imperialists will never lay down their butcher knives, and they will never become Buddhas until their demise."

	The Japanese reactionaries are frenziedly carrying out neo-colonialist expansion abroad, which is determined by their imperialist nature. The Japanese reactionaries are the biggest henchmen of U.S. imperialism in Asia and a dangerous enemy of the peoples of Asian countries.

	The Japanese reactionaries are ambitious, dreaming of hegemony in Asia. However, their foundation is not strong, and their national strength is limited. The malignant expansion of Japan's economy itself harbors various crises that cannot be resolved. Today, the dollar crisis is threatening Japan's economy. Today's Asia is a continent surging with the revolutionary tide of the people, and the days of imperialism's rampage in Asia are long gone. The U.S. imperialism, which is much stronger than Japanese militarism, has already suffered a bloody nose in Asia, let alone the Japanese reactionaries! The Japanese reactionaries' delusion of re-establishing hegemony in Asia is doomed to fail.

### 日本反动派在亚洲的经济扩张

专栏：时事述评

    日本反动派在亚洲的经济扩张
    在美帝国主义扶植下恶性膨胀的日本垄断资本，近年来加紧对外扩张，特别是在从南朝鲜到东南亚的广大地区，到处疯狂地进行新殖民主义的罪恶活动。最近，在美帝国主义的指使下，由日本佐藤政府主持召开了所谓“东南亚开发部长会议”。充当美帝国主义侵略帮凶的日本反动派越来越加速了向东南亚进行侵略和扩张的步伐。
    争夺东南亚市场，加紧商品和资本输出
    第二次世界大战后重新膨胀起来的日本垄断资本，千方百计地向亚洲各地进行经济渗透和扩张，同其它殖民国家争夺东南亚的市场。过去十年里，东南亚地区进口贸易额仅增长五成，而日货的进口额平均每年就增长二成左右。现在日本已成为这个地区市场的第二个大出口国。
    据日本官方公布的材料，近几年来，在亚洲许多国家和地区的对外贸易中，日本已经开始跃居第一位或第二位。例如，日本对南朝鲜的出口，一九六○年占南朝鲜进口总额的百分之二十一，一九六六年就已经增加到百分之四十，超过美国而居第一位。日本对印度尼西亚的出口在该国进口总额中所占的比重，由一九六一年的百分之十八增加到一九六六年的百分之三十，升为第二位。日本在菲律宾进口总额中所占的比重，由一九六一年的百分之二十六增加到一九六六年的百分之三十，居第二位。
    日本垄断集团对东南亚的资本输出不断增加。从二次大战结束到一九六六年底，日本通过各种经济渗透手段向东南亚输出的资本已达四十亿美元以上。其中，所谓“战争赔偿”及“经济合作”共达十九亿五千万美元，投资约五亿美元，出口延期信贷约十五亿美元。特别是从佐藤政府成立的一九六四年起，在不到四年的期间，日本政府已经实施的和公布的对外
  “经济援助”等资本输出额，就已经达到二十二亿美元。一九六七年日本对外“援助”中的政府资金比上一年增加了百分之四十。这些都说明，佐藤政府对外经济扩张的步伐比起战后其他任何一届日本政府都大大加快了。
        借“合作”之名，行掠夺之实
    日本反动派在向东南亚各地大举扩张当中，打着海外“经济合作”的旗号，高唱“协助开发东南亚”。但是，不论什么旗号和花言巧语，都掩盖不了日本反动派在东南亚地区进行疯狂榨取、掠夺和控制的血淋淋的事实。
    日本资产阶级报刊毫不讳言，东南亚地区富饶的矿产和农林水产资源，是日本垄断资本垂涎的对象。目前，东南亚的许多重要资源，包括铁矿、铜矿、木材、石油等开采权，已在不同程度上落到日本垄断资本手中。马来亚出口铁砂的全部，沙巴出口木材的八成，菲律宾出口木材和铜矿的八成，泰国出口玉米的七成、橡胶的三成，印尼出口石油的三成，都被日本垄断资本所控制。
    日本对东南亚的贸易年年有大量出超。过去十年里，它通过贸易在东南亚捞取了五十六亿美元的巨额外汇。
    特别值得注意的是，在日本对东南亚的贸易中，军火出口的数量越来越多。去年四月，佐藤在国会上大肆鼓吹，日本可以“向国外出口防御性武器”，叫嚷什么禁止武器出口，“是不公平的”。日本垄断资本企图从军火出口中攫取更大的利润。
    榨取东南亚的廉价劳动力，是日本资本输出的一个主要“刺激”。日本《海外市场》杂志垂涎三尺地说，“香港、南朝鲜、台湾、泰国、马来亚等地的工资，是日本最低工资的一半甚至七分之一”。日本许多大垄断公司在海外各地开办分店、装配工厂和其他工厂，利用当地的廉价劳动力加工产品，攫取高额利润。
    打入海外的日本企业，已有相当一部分在当地占据了垄断地位。例如，日本丰田汽车公司向南朝鲜一家公司出口汽车零件，垄断小汽车的生产。日本的资本控制了南朝鲜的船舶修造部门的百分之八十，还控制了那里的全部盐化树脂工业部门。据一九六六年十一月底的统计，在南朝鲜七亿二千万美元的外国资本中，日本占百分之三十，仅次于美国。南朝鲜事实上已经沦为美帝国主义和日本军国主义的双重殖民地。
      妄图重温“大东亚共荣圈”的旧梦
    日本反动派的日益猖狂的对外扩张活动，是它对美帝国主义在亚洲的侵略政策和战争政策的直接支持和配合，也是它加紧复活军国主义的一个重要方面。近年来，日本反动派一面在国内加紧扩军备战，一面大大加强对东南亚地区的扩张和渗透，企图建立一个以美国为后台、日本为核心，北起南朝鲜、南至澳大利亚、新西兰的所谓“亚洲太平洋圈”，形成一个反华包围圈。日本反动派为什么这样卖力地拼凑反华的“亚洲太平洋圈”呢？其目的有二。一个是同美帝苏修紧密勾结和配合，加紧反对社会主义中国；同时“稳定”美帝国主义及其走狗在亚洲各国的反动统治，镇压亚洲各国人民的革命斗争。另一个是以“经济合作”为幌子，加紧对东南亚各国的经济渗透和控制，重建日本军国主义在这个地区的势力范围，妄图重温当年“大东亚共荣圈”的迷梦。
    日本统治集团近来猖狂地大肆鼓吹加紧复活军国主义和对外侵略。一些军国主义头子公开煽动说，东南亚地区是日本的“生命线”，日本应当把“海上战线”延长到马六甲海峡。日本“防卫厅”的一个官员在杂志上大放厥词说：“作为下一个课题，必须给予认真考虑的是”日本以什么姿态来“领导”亚洲太平洋地区各国，日本“对这些国家的防卫作出什么贡献”。日本反动派还企图利用英帝国主义从苏伊士运河以东撤军的形势，充当英帝国主义在亚洲的遗产继承人，以扩大它的势力范围。最近时期以来日本反动派加紧同拉赫曼—李光耀集团的勾结，就是一个具体的表现。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“我们说‘帝国主义是很凶恶的’，就是说它的本性是不能改变的，帝国主义分子决不肯放下屠刀，他们也决不能成佛，直至他们的灭亡。”
    日本反动派疯狂地对外进行新殖民主义扩张，这是它的帝国主义本性所决定的。日本反动派是美帝国主义在亚洲的大帮凶，是亚洲各国人民的危险敌人。
    日本反动派野心勃勃，一心想要称霸亚洲。但是，它的家底不厚，国力有限。日本的恶性膨胀的经济本身就潜藏着种种无法解脱的危机。现在，美元危机正在威胁着日本的经济。今日之亚洲，是人民革命怒潮汹涌澎湃的亚洲，帝国主义在亚洲横行霸道的日子早已一去不复返了。比日本军国主义强大得多的美帝国主义，尚且在亚洲碰得头破血流，何况是区区日本反动派！日本反动派妄想重新称霸亚洲的迷梦，是注定要破灭的。
