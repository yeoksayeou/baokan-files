The revolutionary committee of the Taozhuang Coal Mine, with the help of the People's Liberation Army stationed at the mine, has been vigorously focusing on class struggle and ideological education, deeply engaging in revolutionary criticism, and promoting the flourishing development of revolution and production.

The Taozhuang Coal Mine established its revolutionary committee on January 26 of this year. In the midst of a good situation for revolution and production, some comrades thought that the class enemies had been sentenced to "death" and could take a breather. Others believed that after the establishment of the revolutionary committee, the main effort should be on production, resulting in a relaxation of revolutionary criticism and a less tight grip on class struggle. The stationed PLA promptly discovered this trend and, together with the mine's revolutionary committee, organized a study class on Mao Zedong Thought. They led the broad revolutionary workers and cadres to study Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, helping everyone recognize that in any situation, one must not forget class struggle and must not forget the revolutionary criticism of the handful of capitalist roaders within the party. Through study, everyone's awareness was raised, and their class struggle consciousness was strengthened. By linking this with the actual situation of the mine area, they analyzed the new situation of class struggle after the establishment of the revolutionary committee. Everyone saw that the class enemies were not asleep; they were launching new forms of attacks against the proletariat. Some bad elements were gathering social scum, attempting to disrupt the revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and to sabotage the efforts to seize revolution and promote production.

After raising their awareness of class struggle and ideological struggle, the members of the Taozhuang Coal Mine revolutionary committee went deep into the production front lines. They worked alongside the workers and engaged in revolutionary criticism, vigorously focusing on class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. They invited old miners who had suffered greatly to share their stories of bitterness and sweetness, stirring up the boundless love for Chairman Mao among the revolutionary miners, and resolutely eliminating the poisonous influence of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line that China's Khrushchev had promoted in industrial and mining enterprises. Through criticism, everyone's eyes were opened, and they further recognized the reactionary face of China's Khrushchev. At the same time, they exposed and criticized the class enemies who had disguised themselves and infiltrated the revolutionary ranks, thoroughly exposing and criticizing their evil deeds of sabotaging the revolution and production. This raised the class consciousness of the broad revolutionary miners, making them more closely unite around the revolutionary committee.

Class struggle, once grasped, works wonders. In February, a few working faces in this mine needed to be relocated. To ensure that the production task was not affected, everyone from the leadership to the masses was busy grabbing pickaxes, axes, production quotas, and advance meters. However, although all the mine's cadres were mobilized to go down to the pits, production still did not improve. Later, they focused on class struggle and the ideological transformation of people, exposing the class enemies' plot to use bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchist trends within the revolutionary ranks to sow discord and sabotage production. This raised the class consciousness of the broad workers, who voluntarily overcame factionalism and anarchism, strengthened their revolutionary spirit, scientific approach, and organizational discipline. The production situation quickly improved.

Now, the revolution and production at the Taozhuang Coal Mine present a very good situation. Revolutionary criticism is being carried out vigorously, revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination are being continuously consolidated and developed, and coal production and advance meters have both completed the first quarter's plan ahead of schedule.

    带领革命职工向敌人主动进攻
    陶庄煤矿革委会狠抓阶级斗争
    在人民解放军的帮助下，揭露了阶级敌人的破坏阴谋，革命和生产出现一派大好景象
    据新华社济南五日电山东枣庄矿务局陶庄煤矿革委会在驻矿解放军的帮助下，狠抓阶级斗争和路线斗争教育，深入开展革命大批判，推动革命和生产蓬勃发展。
    陶庄煤矿于今年一月二十六日成立了矿革命委员会。在革命、生产一派大好形势下，有些同志认为，阶级敌人已经被宣判了“死刑”，可以歇口气了。有的认为，革委会成立后，应该把主要精力放到抓生产上去，结果放松了革命的大批判，对阶级斗争不是抓得那样紧了。驻矿解放军及时发现了这种思想倾向，就同矿革命委员会一起举办毛泽东思想学习班，组织广大革命职工和革命干部学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述，使大家认识到，在任何情况下，都不能忘记阶级斗争，都不能忘记对党内一小撮走资派的革命大批判。通过学习，大家提高了觉悟，加强了阶级斗争观念，再联系矿区的实际，分析了革委会成立以后阶级斗争的新形势。大家看到阶级敌人并没有睡觉，他们正在以新的形式向无产阶级进攻。有些坏家伙纠集社会上的牛鬼蛇神，妄图破坏革命的大联合和革命的三结合，破坏抓革命促生产。
    陶庄煤矿革委会的成员在提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟后，就深入生产第一线，和工人一起劳动，一起开展革命大批判，狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的教育。他们请苦大仇深的老矿工进行忆苦思甜，激发广大革命矿工无限热爱毛主席的无产阶级感情，坚决肃清中国赫鲁晓夫在工矿企业中推行的反革命修正主义路线的流毒。通过大批判，大家擦亮了眼睛，进一步认清了中国赫鲁晓夫的反动嘴脸，同时，还把乔装打扮，混进革命队伍内的阶级敌人揪了出来，彻底揭发批判了他们破坏革命、破坏生产的罪恶勾当，使广大革命矿工提高了阶级觉悟，更加紧密地团结在革命委员会的周围。
    阶级斗争，一抓就灵。二月份这个矿有几个工作面要搬家。为了不影响生产任务的完成，从领导到群众，都忙着去抓镐头、斧头、产量、进尺。但是，虽然动员了全矿的干部下井，生产还是上不去。后来，他们大抓阶级斗争和人的思想革命化，揭露了阶级敌人利用革命队伍中的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和无政府主义思潮，挑拨离间，破坏生产的阴谋，提高了广大职工的阶级觉悟，他们自觉地克服派性和无政府主义，加强革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，生产面貌很快就有了改变。
    现在，陶庄煤矿革命、生产呈现一派大好景象。革命大批判正在轰轰烈烈地开展起来，革命大联合和革命三结合不断巩固和发展，煤炭产量和掘进进尺分别提前完成了第一季度计划。
