The organ of the Malayan National Liberation League's mission to China, *Malayan News*, recently reported that political prisoners in North Kalimantan, who are being brutally persecuted by the Rahman puppet regime, have launched a hunger strike in enemy prisons, demonstrating their brave and tenacious revolutionary spirit.

The report said that in a concentration camp in Kuching, the capital of Sarawak, the Rahman puppet regime has imprisoned about 600 political prisoners, including the sick and pregnant women. These political prisoners have been subjected to fascist torture, interrogation, and racial abuse. However, the persecution has not weakened their resolve. These patriots issued a protest statement and launched a hunger strike. News of this struggle by the patriots quickly spread to various places. Many progressive political groups and unions issued statements supporting the revolutionary actions taken by the political prisoners.

Relatives of the political prisoners came from various places to Kuching to provide moral and material support to their loved ones. These relatives also staged a hunger strike in front of the puppet government building. Some of them fainted due to exhaustion. However, upon regaining consciousness, their first words were: "Continue the struggle!"

Faced with the brave struggle of the political prisoners and their families, the enemy was forced to accept the demands put forward by these patriots. However, the Rahman puppet regime soon intensified its persecution of the political prisoners. Revolutionary youth Chong Yonghua died in prison after being subjected to various tortures. All the political prisoners were outraged and launched a second hunger strike, demanding a memorial service for Chong Yonghua and the publication of their eulogies in the newspapers.

The struggle of the political prisoners and the support from people of all walks of life forced the enemy to make another concession. All newspapers in Kuching published their eulogies, and people from all walks of life held a grand funeral for Chong Yonghua with the participation of 20,000 people.

*Malayan News* quoted the words of the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao: "In front of the beast, one must not show the slightest cowardice." The revolutionary patriots of North Kalimantan possess this fearless spirit because they firmly believe that in this arduous struggle, truth is on their side.

    表现爱国者坚强战斗的革命气概
    北加里曼丹政治犯同敌人英勇斗争
    新华社七日讯　马来亚民族解放同盟驻中国代表团的机关刊物《马来亚公报》最近报道，遭到拉赫曼傀儡集团残酷迫害的北加里曼丹政治犯，在敌人的监狱里开展绝食斗争，表现了他们英勇顽强的革命气概。
    报道说，在沙捞越首府古晋的一个集中营里，拉赫曼傀儡集团关押了包括病人和孕妇在内的约六百名政治犯。这些政治犯受到法西斯拷打、审讯和种族虐待。但是，迫害并没有削弱他们的斗志。这些爱国者发表抗议声明，举行绝食斗争。有关爱国者的这次斗争的消息很快就传到各地。一些进步的政治团体和工会纷纷发表声明，支持政治犯所采取的革命行动。
    政治犯的亲属从各地来到古晋，给自己的亲人以道义和物质的支援。这些亲属们在傀儡政府大楼前也进行绝食斗争。其中有些人由于体力不支而晕倒了。但是，他们苏醒过来后头一句话就是：“继续战斗！”
    在政治犯及其家属的英勇斗争面前，敌人被迫接受了这些爱国者所提出的要求。但是，拉赫曼傀儡集团不久之后又加紧对政治犯的迫害。爱国青年钟永华因遭到各种折磨，在狱中牺牲了。全体政治犯义愤填膺，又举行了第二次绝食抗议，要求为钟永华烈士开追悼会，在报上公开刊登他们的追悼词。
    政治犯的斗争和各界人民的声援，迫使敌人不得不又一次让步。古晋所有报纸都刊登了他们的追悼词，各界人民为钟永华烈士举行了有二万人参加的大规模葬礼。
    《马来亚公报》引述世界人民伟大领袖毛主席的话说：“在野兽面前，不可以表示丝毫的怯懦。”北加里曼丹革命爱国者具有这种大无畏的精神，是因为他们坚信，在这场艰苦的斗争中，真理在他们一边。
