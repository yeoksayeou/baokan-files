The American ruling class, scorched by the blazing flames of the Black Power struggle, hastily threw out a so-called "civil rights" bill on April 10, attempting to use this empty promise of non-discrimination in housing to quell the Black people's fighting spirit. Johnson himself took the stage, shouting about how "through legal procedures, we can once and for all shatter the unjust shackles of the past." This is sheer, unadulterated nonsense.

Since American independence, every U.S. president has, in order to ease Black people's struggles, hypocritically proposed numerous so-called "civil rights" bills. However, these measures are all empty promises, completely unenforceable. As the Black people's struggle has developed, more and more "civil rights" bills have been introduced, yet the discrimination and oppression Black people face from American monopoly capital and its ruling machinery remain unchanged, even worsening. The American ruling class has been playing this trick to deceive Black people all along.

The American state apparatus is in the hands of the American monopoly bourgeoisie. Every law passed by this state apparatus is designed to maintain the rule of American monopoly capital and to exploit and oppress the American people. The so-called "civil rights" bills are no exception.

The American system of racial discrimination, at its core, is a system by which American monopoly capital exploits Black people for super profits. It is an important component of American imperialism.

The American ruling class's constant concern is not the removal of the shackles from Black people but rather the maintenance and tightening of these shackles. The numerous so-called "civil rights" bills concocted by the American ruling class are nothing more than sedatives to numb the fighting spirit of Black people.

The great revolutionary leader Lenin once said, "Black people were the last to be freed from slavery, and even now they still bear the deep scars of slavery, even in the most advanced countries, because capitalism, apart from legal emancipation, cannot 'accommodate' any other form of emancipation, and even legal emancipation is subject to various restrictions." This passage by Lenin deeply reveals that only by completely overthrowing the cannibalistic American capitalist system can Black people in America achieve true liberation.

Through their long-term struggle, the broad masses of Black people in America have gradually seen through the deception of the American ruling class's "civil rights" bills and have come to understand that only by uniting and fighting against the American ruling class can they achieve their liberation. The continued armed struggle of Black people in America is the loudest response to the American ruling class's "civil rights" deception. At this moment, Johnson's attempt to spread his failed sedative only further exposes the American ruling class's helplessness in the face of the Black people's struggle.

    失灵了的蒙汗药
    被美国黑人武力抗暴斗争的熊熊烈火烧得焦头烂额的美国统治集团，在四月十日赶紧抛出了一个所谓“民权”法案，妄图用这张规定在住房方面不得歧视黑人的空头支票，来平息黑人的斗争怒火。约翰逊还亲自出马，大喊什么“通过法律程序，可以一劳永逸地打碎过去（加在黑人身上的）不公正的枷锁”。这真是无耻透顶的鬼话。
    自从美国独立以来，美国历届总统为了缓和黑人的斗争，假惺惺地提出过许多个所谓“民权”法案。但是这些东西，完全是有名无实，根本实行不了。随着美国黑人斗争的发展，“民权”法案也越来越多地出笼，而黑人从美国垄断资本和它们的统治机器所受到的歧视和压迫却依然如故，甚至变本加厉。美国统治集团就这样一直玩弄着这种愚弄黑人的鬼把戏。
    美国的国家机器，掌握在美国垄断资产阶级手里。这个国家机器所通过的一切法律，没有一个不是为了维护美国垄断资本的统治、剥削和压迫美国人民的。所谓“民权”法案，也是这样。
    美国的种族歧视制度，归根到底，是美国垄断资本对黑人榨取超额利润的制度。它是美国帝国主义制度的一个重要的组成部分。
    美国统治集团所日夜不忘的，绝不是什么去掉黑人身上的枷锁，而是千方百计保持和加重黑人身上的枷锁。美国统治集团所炮制的一个又一个所谓“民权”法案，都不过是麻痹黑人斗争意志的蒙汗药罢了。
    伟大的革命导师列宁曾经说过，“黑人摆脱奴隶制度最迟，他们身上直到现在还带有奴隶制度留下的极深的痕迹，甚至在先进国家也是如此，因为资本主义除了法律上的解放以外，不可能‘容纳’其他方面的解放，就是法律上的解放也受到各种各样的限制。”列宁的这段话，极其深刻地指出了，只有彻底推翻吃人的美国资本主义制度，美国黑人才能得到真正的解放。
    广大的美国黑人通过自己长期的斗争实践，逐步识破了美国统治集团玩弄的“民权”法案的骗局，懂得了只有团结起来同美国统治集团进行针锋相对的斗争，才能取得自己的解放。美国黑人继续坚持武力抗暴斗争，就是对美国统治集团的“民权”骗局的最响亮的回答。在这个时候，约翰逊还来大撒他那失灵了的蒙汗药，只是更加暴露了美国统治集团在黑人斗争面前手足无措的窘态而已。
