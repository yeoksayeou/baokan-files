The Revolutionary Committee of the Wuwwei Railway Division of the Lanzhou Railway Bureau has organized various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes for workers' families, ensuring that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are implemented among the broad masses of workers' families. This has significantly raised the class consciousness and the consciousness of line struggle among workers' families, promoting their ideological revolutionization.

The Wuwwei Railway Division of the Lanzhou Railway Bureau manages over 500 kilometers of railway transportation lines. Most of the division's workers' families reside along the railway in the Hexi Corridor. The Revolutionary Committee, considering the long lines and scattered residences of workers' families, has helped organize Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Since last December, the division has held 79 such classes, with over 1,400 participants. In areas like Wuwwei and Wunan, where many workers' families reside, more than 70% have participated in these study classes.

These workers' families come from various parts of the country, with the majority originating from poor working-class and peasant backgrounds. Before liberation, they all had a history of suffering and hardship. After liberation, they have enjoyed a happy life. They have an infinite love for Chairman Mao, the Communist Party, and socialism. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, due to the influence of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party who promoted the capitalist reactionary line, workers' families were divided into two factions, leading to long-term opposition and making it difficult to carry out various tasks. To address this situation, the Revolutionary Committee of the Wuwwei Division organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes for workers' families, using Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "Three Articles" as their ideological weapons, and focusing on "criticizing selfishness and criticizing revisionism." They conducted "Two Remembrances and Two Comparisons" activities: remembering the bitterness of the old society and comparing it with the sweetness of the new society; remembering the bitterness caused by the capitalist reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev and comparing it with the sweetness of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Through these activities, they emphasized class struggle education and line struggle education, raising the consciousness of class struggle and line struggle among workers' families. They directed their hatred towards the Chinese Khrushchev, promoting the revolutionary unity of workers' families.

In the Wunan area, two family committee members who originally had a good relationship became enemies due to the influence of the capitalist reactionary line during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In the study class, after learning Chairman Mao's latest instructions and recalling past hardships and comparing them with the present, they realized they were both deceived by the Chinese Khrushchev and should direct their criticism towards him. Through learning, they quickly resolved their differences and strengthened their unity.

Previously, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Wuwwei Division Party Committee had long promoted a counter-revolutionary revisionist line, emphasizing material incentives. This led to a bourgeois ideology of comparing material possessions and seeking comfort among some workers' families, especially young women. This not only affected family relationships but also influenced the education of the next generation. Considering this situation, the Revolutionary Committee, while helping organize study classes for families, emphasized using the political and economic status changes of women in the old and new societies for class education. They continuously raised their socialist consciousness, encouraging them to deeply love, believe in, worship, and be loyal to Chairman Mao. They actively learned and applied Chairman Mao's works, sparking a revolution in their souls, striving to change their worldview, promote ideological revolutionization, and step out of the family circle to contribute to the construction of a great socialist society. The Mao Zedong Thought study classes also led workers' families to conduct a revolutionary critique, thoroughly criticizing the revisionist goods promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev, such as the wage system and material incentives. Many workers' families, after the revolutionary critique and recalling their childhood lives and comparing the political and economic status of women in the old and new societies, expressed that they could no longer coexist with bourgeois ideology. Yang Juhua, a worker's family member from the Wuwwei Engineering Section, said, "In the old society, I was born into a poor worker's family and suffered greatly under the capitalists. If it weren't for Chairman Mao, I wouldn't be alive today. But after liberation, as my life improved, I was blinded by the 'self' and fell into the trap of the Chinese Khrushchev, staying at home all day, indifferent to the world outside, and always calculating about food and clothing. Now I see clearly, I must follow Chairman Mao's words and dedicate my life to the revolution."

Through the study, the spiritual face of the broad masses of workers' families has undergone significant changes. After returning from the study classes, many families established their own Mao Zedong Thought study classes, and some families implemented the "Daily Reading" of Chairman Mao's works, actively participating in the "Three Loyalties" activities, and building new types of family relationships with Mao Zedong Thought. Through organizing study classes, the division's workers' families have universally established the new socialist customs of thrift, participating in production labor, and selflessly serving others.

Currently, over 600 workers' families in the division have participated in agricultural production labor. Those who have not participated in agricultural production have actively engaged in volunteer labor along the railway lines in various stations. From the snowy and cold Wushan Ridge to the windy and sandy Hexi Corridor, workers' families have formed large teams of Mao Zedong Thought propaganda and service teams, day and night, taking turns to propagate Mao Zedong Thought to passengers, performing artistic programs, maintaining station order, and actively providing services such as delivering water and food to passengers and helping stations with cleaning. Incomplete statistics show that since January, they have served over 210 passenger trains and 230,000 passengers within the division's jurisdiction, receiving praise letters from more than ten provinces and cities.

    职工家属破私立公　精神面貌显著变化
    提高阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟，普遍树立勤俭持家、参加生产劳动和毫不利己专门利人的社会主义新风尚
    据新华社兰州六日电　兰州铁路局武威分局革命委员会帮助职工家属举办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，把毛主席的最新指示落实到广大职工家属中去，大大提高了职工家属的阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟，促进了她们的思想革命化。
    兰州铁路局武威分局管辖着五百多公里的铁路运输线，全分局职工家属主要居住在铁路沿线的河西走廊地带。分局革委会根据管辖范围内线长、点多，家属居住比较分散的特点，帮助职工家属开办毛泽东思想学习班。从去年十二月份到现在，全分局已先后举办各种类型的职工家属学习班七十九期，参加学习的达一千四百多人。武威和武南等家属居住较多的地区，已有百分之七十以上的职工家属参加了学习班。
    这些职工家属来自全国各地，绝大部分出身于贫苦的工人和贫下中农家庭，解放前，都有一部悲惨的血泪史。解放后，她们过上了幸福生活。她们无限热爱毛主席，无限热爱共产党，无限热爱社会主义。在无产阶级文化大革命中，由于党内一小撮走资派推行资产阶级反动路线的影响，职工家属之间分成了两派，长期对立，致使各项工作很难开展。针对这种情况，武威分局革委会帮助职工家属举办的毛泽东思想学习班，都以毛主席的一系列最新指示和“老三篇”为思想武器，以“斗私，批修”为纲，深入开展了“两忆两比”活动。即忆旧社会的苦，比新社会的甜；忆中国赫鲁晓夫资产阶级反动路线的苦，比毛主席无产阶级革命路线的甜。通过“两忆两比”活动，狠抓阶级斗争教育和路线斗争教育，使职工家属普遍提高阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟，把千仇万恨集中到中国赫鲁晓夫身上，促进了职工家属的革命大联合。
    武南地区有两个家属委员，原来关系很好，在无产阶级文化大革命中由于受了资产阶级反动路线的影响，两个人成了冤家对头。在学习班里，两人经过学习毛主席的最新指示和进行忆苦思甜，认识到她们原来都是一根藤上的瓜，是上了中国赫鲁晓夫的当，应该把矛头对准中国赫鲁晓夫。通过学习，两人很快消除了隔阂，加强了团结。
    过去，武威分局党委内一小撮走资派长期推行一套反革命修正主义路线，大搞物质刺激，因此在一部分职工家属，特别是青年妇女中滋长了一种比吃穿、图安逸的资产阶级思想。这样不仅影响到家庭关系，而且影响到教育下一代。根据这种情况，分局的革命委员会在帮助家属举办学习班时，特别重视用妇女新旧社会政治地位和经济地位发生的巨大变化进行阶级教育，不断提高她们的社会主义觉悟，促使她们以对毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的深厚阶级感情，带着问题，活学活用毛主席著作，在灵魂深处爆发革命；努力改造世界观，促进思想革命化，走出家庭小圈子，为建设伟大的社会主义贡献自己的力量。毛泽东思想学习班还领导职工家属开展革命大批判，把中国赫鲁晓夫所鼓吹的金钱挂帅、物质刺激等修正主义黑货批深、批透、批倒、批臭。许多职工家属经过革命大批判，并在回忆了自己的童年生活和对比了新旧社会妇女所处的政治地位和经济地位后，表示再不能和资产阶级思想和平共处了。武威工务段职工家属杨菊花说：“旧社会，我出身在一个贫苦的工人家庭里，受尽了资本家的折磨，不是毛主席搭救，我就活不到今天。可是解放后日子好过了，我却被‘私’字迷住了心窍，上了中国赫鲁晓夫的圈套，成天呆在家里，两耳不闻窗外事，尽在吃穿上打算盘。现在我才心明眼亮了，我一定要听毛主席的话，跟着毛主席干一辈子革命。”
    通过学习，广大职工家属精神面貌发生了显著变化。家属从学习班回去后，不少人办起了家庭毛泽东思想学习班，有些家庭建立了学习毛主席著作的“天天读”等制度，积极开展了“三忠于”活动，用毛泽东思想建立了新型的家庭关系。通过办学习班，这个分局的职工家属普遍树立了勤俭持家光荣，参加生产劳动光荣和毫不利己专门利人的社会主义新风尚。
    目前，全分局已有六百多名职工家属参加农业生产劳动。没有参加农业生产的职工家属，普遍在铁路沿线各站区开展了为旅客服务的义务劳动。从风雪严寒的乌鞘岭到气候多变的河西走廊风沙地带，职工家属组成大批毛泽东思想宣传队和服务队，日夜轮流给旅客宣传毛泽东思想，演唱文艺节目，维持车站秩序，并主动开展给旅客送水、送饭和帮助车站打扫卫生等工作。据不完全统计，从元月份以来，她们在分局管辖范围内接送的旅客列车共达二百一十多列，为旅客服务达二十三万人次，曾收到了十多个省、市旅客的来信表扬。
