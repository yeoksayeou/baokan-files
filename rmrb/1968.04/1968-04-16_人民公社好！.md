Long Live the People's Commune!

Pinggu County Beizhai Production Brigade Liu Zimin Ding Jingxiang

The Chinese Khrushchev incites individual farming, claiming that peasants have not benefited from the collective economy. Open your eyes and see the situation in our countryside! What is it like?

We poor and lower-middle peasants all cheer for the people's commune. It is good in every way, and it is good because it is a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. With Mao Zedong Thought, the spirit of public ownership is greatly promoted, and any miracle can be created. What is good about the "three autonomies and one contract"? It benefits one household but harms a hundred families; it benefits landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements but harms poor and lower-middle peasants; it benefits capitalism but harms socialism. We warn the Chinese Khrushchev: we are not on the same path. With our good, there is no room for your good. With your good, capitalism will be restored, and we will suffer twice. You dream of using the sweet talk of landlords and rich peasants to deceive us and seize the red socialist mountain. This is absolutely impossible!

    人民公社好！
    平谷县北寨大队　刘自敏　丁井祥
    中国赫鲁晓夫煽动单干，胡说农民“从集体经济中间没有得到好处”。睁开你的眼睛看一看，我们农村的情况，是个什么样子吗！？
    我们贫下中农无不欢呼人民公社好。千好万好，好就好在它是毛泽东思想的大学校。有了毛泽东思想，“公”字大发扬，什么人间奇迹都可创造出来。“三自一包”，“好”在哪里！？它好了一户，坑了百家；好了地富反坏，坑了贫下中农；好了资本主义，坑了社会主义。正告中国赫鲁晓夫，我们和你走的不是一条道。有了我们的好，就没有你们的好；有了你们的好，资本主义就要复辟，我们就要受二茬罪。你妄想用地主富农的花言巧语，骗去社会主义的红色江山，这一万个办不到！
