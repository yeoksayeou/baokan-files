The U.S. imperialist chief, Johnson, on March 31st, in a television and radio broadcast, threw out a so-called "partial bombing halt" "peace talks" plan for North Vietnam. This is a new big swindle played by the Johnson administration in the face of its miserable defeat in the Vietnam War and its deepening crises both domestically and internationally.

Johnson, in his speech, shouted that the United States is "ready to immediately move towards peace through negotiations." For this purpose, he said he "wants to take the first step to gradually reduce the conflict," announcing that U.S. aircraft and naval vessels "will no longer attack North Vietnam, except in the areas north of the demilitarized zone." Johnson bluntly said that he "hopes this action will lead to early talks." In a word, Johnson wants to use the trick of a "bombing halt" to induce the Vietnamese people to lay down their weapons and surrender to the U.S. aggressors.

Johnson is playing this trick to try to get out of the U.S. imperialists' current predicament of being cornered both internally and externally.

The U.S. imperialists have suffered a complete defeat in the Vietnam War. Recently, the Vietnamese people's New Year Offensive has dealt an unprecedented heavy blow to the U.S. aggressors. The U.S. imperialists are now at their wits' end on the Vietnam battlefield. The continuous increase in war expenses in Vietnam has expanded the U.S.'s huge fiscal and international payments deficits, deepening the extremely serious financial crisis, and causing the dollar to continue to depreciate. The U.S. imperialists' position as the "hegemon" in the capitalist world is shaky, and class contradictions within the United States are becoming increasingly acute. The U.S. people's mass movement against the Vietnam War is surging. The armed struggle of U.S. blacks against violence is in full swing. The infighting within the U.S. ruling class is becoming more and more intense. Johnson's days are even harder.

At this time, Johnson throws out the new "bombing halt and peace talks" swindle, obviously to gain breathing room on the Vietnam battlefield to further expand the war; at the same time, it is also to use the empty talk of "reducing the level of the Vietnam War" to stabilize public opinion, stabilize the position of the dollar, and cope with domestic and international public opinion pressure, easing class contradictions within the United States and infighting within the ruling class.

To add a bit of deception to the effect of the new "bombing halt and peace talks" plot, to make people believe that the "peace talks" plan he proposed is not for "elections," Johnson also "tearfully" announced that he would "not accept the nomination for the presidency." However, those with discerning eyes can see that this pathetic performance is nothing more than a clumsy trick of a bourgeois politician.

Our great teacher Chairman Mao teaches us: "All reactionary forces, when they are about to perish, will inevitably resort to military adventurism and political deception of various kinds to save themselves from extinction."

Johnson's television speech itself exposes his so-called "bombing halt" and "peace talks" as thorough and complete war blackmail and political deception. On the one hand, he claims to want to "halt bombing," but on the other hand, he menacingly shouts: "We cannot stop all bombing. Whether it is possible to achieve a complete bombing halt in the future will depend on the development of the situation." He swears that the U.S. determination to invade Vietnam is "unshakable," and announces that the United States will soon send another 13,000-plus troops to South Vietnam, and in the next two fiscal years will allocate an additional 51 billion dollars for the Vietnam War, in addition to "accelerating the re-equipping" of the South Vietnamese puppet army.

Not only that. Immediately after Johnson's television speech was issued, the United States carried out a frenzied bombing of North Vietnam, conducting more than a hundred raids in one day. At the same time, the Johnson administration announced that it would call up 50,000 reservists to strengthen the Vietnam War. At the April 2nd meeting of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, U.S. Secretary of State Rusk openly threatened that if the "bombing halt and peace talks" plot fails, the United States will engage in "more intense fighting."

These facts fully show that Johnson's "peace talks" scam, despite its new tricks, is essentially a smokescreen to cover the expansion of the war.

Johnson's new "peace talks" scam is coordinated with the Soviet revisionist clique. In recent periods, at the behest of the Johnson administration, the Soviet revisionist clique, as well as the British Labour government and the United Nations Secretary-General U Thant, have been busy everywhere, actively promoting the U.S. "peace talks" scam. Johnson, in this television speech, openly demands that the Soviet revisionist clique and the British Labour government use their positions as co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference to "do everything possible" to promote the U.S. imperialists' new "bombing halt and peace talks" plot. According to Western media reports, the United States informed the Soviet and British governments of Johnson's plan in advance. At the same time, Johnson, in addition to designating Harriman as the U.S. negotiator, also specifically asked the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Thompson, who recently returned to the country to "report on his duties," to prepare to participate in the talks with Harriman. It is obvious that in Johnson's newly planned plot, the Soviet revisionist clique once again plays the shameful role of the number one accomplice.

The nature of U.S. imperialism will not change, and it will not voluntarily give up its aggression against Vietnam. Johnson recently shouted that the United States must "win victory" in the Vietnam War, "preferably at the negotiating table, but if we must win on the battlefield, then we will win on the battlefield." This nakedly exposes that U.S. imperialism, no matter what tricks it plays, remains unchanged in essence. Its fundamental purpose is to long-term partition Vietnam and permanently occupy South Vietnam. Therefore, only by thoroughly defeating the U.S. aggressors on the battlefield and forcing the U.S. aggressors to withdraw from South Vietnam can the Vietnam problem be solved.

The great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh, recently pointed out: "Justice is on our side. Our entire nation and soldiers are united as one, brave and wise, fighting to the end and winning decisively. We will surely achieve a complete victory!" The Vietnamese people will continue to fight to the end, and they will surely drive the U.S. aggressors out of their sacred land. In the face of the heroic Vietnamese people, no matter how desperately the U.S. imperialists struggle or what tricks they play, they will not be able to save themselves from complete annihilation on the Vietnam battlefield.

### 美帝头子约翰逊玩弄“部分停炸诱和”的新骗局

    美帝头子约翰逊玩弄“部分停炸诱和”的新骗局
    新华社五日讯　本社记者报道：美帝国主义头子约翰逊，三月三十一日在一次电视广播讲话中，抛出了一个对越南北方实行所谓“部分停炸”的“和谈”方案。这是约翰逊政府在侵越战争中遭到惨败，在国内外陷入重重危机的情况下所玩弄的一个新的大骗局。
    约翰逊在讲话中叫嚷说，美国“准备马上走向通过谈判实现的和平”。为此，他“要迈出使冲突逐步降级的第一步”，宣布美国的飞机和海军舰只“不再袭击北越，只有在非军事区以北的地区除外”。约翰逊露骨地说，他“希望这个行动会导致早日会谈”。一句话，约翰逊就是要用“停炸”的花招，来诱迫越南人民放下武器，向美国侵略者屈膝投降。
    约翰逊玩弄这一手，是想要摆脱美帝国主义目前内外交困的窘境。
    美帝国主义在侵越战争中一败涂地。最近，越南南方军民的新春攻势，又给了美国侵略者空前沉重的打击。美帝国主义在越南战场上已经走投无路。侵越军费开支的不断增加，扩大了美国财政和国际收支的巨额赤字，加深了极其严重的财政危机，促使美元继续贬值。美帝国主义在资本主义世界的“霸主”地位摇摇欲坠，美国国内的阶级矛盾日益激化。美国人民反对侵越战争的群众运动日益高涨。美国黑人的武力抗暴斗争方兴未艾。美国统治集团内部的倾轧越来越剧烈。约翰逊的日子更加不好过了。
    约翰逊在这样的时候抛出“停炸诱和”新骗局，显然是为了在越南战场上赢得喘息时间，以便进一步扩大战争；同时也是为了用侵越战争“降级”的空谈，来安定人心，稳住美元的地位，并且应付国内外舆论的压力，缓和美国国内的阶级矛盾和统治集团内部的争吵。
    为了给“停炸诱和”新阴谋增加一点欺骗的效果，使人们相信他提出的“和谈”方案不是为了“竞选”，约翰逊在讲话中还“含泪”宣布“不接受总统候选人的提名”。但是明眼人都可以看出，这种丑态百出的表演，不过是资产阶级政客的一种拙劣的手法而已。
    我们伟大的导师毛主席教导我们：“一切反动势力在他们行将灭亡的时候，总是要进行垂死挣扎的。他们必然要采取军事冒险和政治欺骗的种种手段，来挽救自己的灭亡。”
    约翰逊的电视讲话本身，就揭穿了他所谓的“停炸”、“和谈”是彻头彻尾的战争讹诈和政治欺骗。他一面宣称要“停炸”，一面又杀气腾腾地叫嚷：“我们是不能停止一切轰炸的。以后是不是可能实现全面停炸，将取决于事态发展。”他赌咒发誓，美国侵略越南的“决心不可动摇”，并且宣布美国将在最近继续向南越增派一万三千多名侵略军，在今明两个财政年度内还将增拨侵越军费五十一亿美元，此外还要“加速重新装备”南越傀儡军队。
    不仅如此。紧接着约翰逊的电视讲话发表以后，美国就对越南北方进行狂轰滥炸，在一天之内进行了一百多次袭击。同时，约翰逊政府宣布要征召五万名后备役人员，准备强化侵越战争。在四月二日的东南亚集团理事会会议上，美国国务卿腊斯克更是露骨地威胁，如果“停炸诱和”的阴谋不能得逞，美国就要进行“更加激烈的战斗”。
    这些事实充分表明，约翰逊这一次抛出来的“和谈”骗局，尽管花样翻新，实质上仍然是掩护扩大战争的烟幕。
    约翰逊的这个新的“诱和”骗局，是同苏修叛徒集团串通一起炮制出来的。最近一个时期来，在约翰逊政府的授意下，苏修叛徒集团以及英国工党政府和联合国秘书长吴丹之流，到处奔忙，为推销美国“和谈”骗局积极效劳。约翰逊在这次电视讲话中更是公开地要求苏修叛徒集团和英国工党政府利用日内瓦会议两主席的身份，“尽一切可能”来推行美帝国主义“停炸诱和”的新阴谋。据西方报刊透露，美国在事先就把约翰逊的方案告诉了苏英两国。同时，约翰逊除了指定哈里曼为美国的谈判代表外，还特地要最近回国“述职”的美国驻苏大使汤普森准备同哈里曼一起参加会谈。显而易见，在约翰逊这次策划的新的阴谋中，苏修叛徒集团又一次扮演了头号帮凶的可耻角色。
    美帝国主义的本性决不会改变，它决不会自动放弃对越南的侵略。约翰逊在不久前就叫嚷：美国要在侵越战争中“赢得胜利”，“最好是在谈判桌旁赢得，但是如果我们必须在战场上赢得的话，就在战场上赢得”。这就赤裸裸地暴露了，美帝国主义不管玩弄那一手，万变不离其宗，它的根本目的都是要长期分割越南，永远霸占越南南方。因此，只有在战场上把美国侵略者彻底打垮，迫使美国侵略者从越南南方滚出去，越南问题才能够得到解决。
    越南人民的伟大领袖胡志明主席最近指出：“正义在我们这一边。我们全国同胞和战士万众一心，英勇机智，决战决胜。我们一定会取得彻底胜利！”越南人民坚持打下去，打到底，一定能够把美国侵略强盗一个不剩地赶出自己神圣的国土。在英雄的越南人民面前，美帝国主义不论进行怎样疯狂的挣扎，不论玩弄什么样的花招，都无法挽救它在越南战场上彻底覆灭的命运。
