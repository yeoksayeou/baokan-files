Vietnamese farmers across the northern region are displaying a spirit of fearlessness in the face of hardship and sacrifice, determined to fight to the end and achieve victory over the American aggressors. They are overcoming various difficulties, strengthening field management, and striving for a good harvest of early rice to contribute to the anti-American national salvation cause.

The American aggressors, in a desperate attempt to reverse their failures in South Vietnam, have intensified their bombing of the North, aiming to disrupt agricultural production. In response to these heinous acts, farmers across the regions are filled with deep hatred for the enemy. Taking the brave and tenacious fighting spirit of the southern military and civilians as their example, they have boldly put forward the slogan, "Not a single inch of land will lack water, not a single rice plant will lack fertilizer," and are launching various competitions to increase production. In Hai Yang Province, Ping Jiang County's youth have cultivated 2,500 acres of water hyacinth as green fertilizer, dug over 2,000 tons of river mud, and built 13,000 meters of irrigation canals. Propaganda teams in various agricultural cooperatives spread the news of the New Year's victories in the South during the farmers' rest periods, further boosting their morale. In Hoai Duc Province, Phu Chau, Ung Hoa, and Thanh Tri counties have established 449 youth shock teams, including 5,000 young men and women, to strengthen field management. The youth of Phu Thu County have been working day and night to build irrigation facilities, excavating 1,718 cubic meters of earth in just 20 days. In Ninh Binh Province, female farmers in various agricultural cooperatives are leading the way in competitions. 15,000 women have voluntarily taken on the task of fertilizing and irrigating 3,000 hectares of fields that are far from home and have poorer soil.

In the regions where the fighting is most intense, such as Vinh Phuc, Ha Nam, Ha Tinh, Nghe An, and Thanh Hoa provinces, the farmers are even more spirited. The youth in these provinces have launched a competition with the slogan, "Everything for the defeat of the American aggressors." In Vinh Phuc District, 14,260 Young Pioneers and youth have joined this competition, taking charge of managing over 3,300 hectares of early rice, striving for high yields. They have built 128,000 cubic meters of irrigation facilities to ensure that the rice fields have enough water. In Nghe An Province, Quynh Luu, Nghia Luong, and Yen Tho counties have established many shock teams to work in the areas most heavily bombed by enemy planes. The farmers in Du Ly, Nam Dan, Vi Thuan, and Nghia Dan counties have completed the first round of weeding despite enemy bombing and naval shelling. To ensure a good harvest of early rice, agricultural cooperatives across the regions are also paying universal attention to fertilization work.

    克服种种困难为抗美救国事业作出贡献
    越南广大农业社员力争早稻丰收
    据新华社河内电　本社记者报道：越南北方广大农业社员，发扬不怕艰苦牺牲，决战决胜美国侵略强盗的精神，克服各种困难，加强田间管理，力争早稻获得好收成，为抗美救国作出贡献。
    美国侵略强盗为了挽救在越南南方的失败，疯狂地扩大对北方的狂轰滥炸，妄图给北方农业生产造成危害。面对美帝国主义这种罪恶行径，各地农业社员们怀着对敌人的深仇大恨，以南方军民勇敢顽强的战斗精神为榜样，豪迈地提出“不叫一寸田缺水，一棵稻子缺肥”的口号，为增加生产开展各种竞赛运动。海阳省平江县青年在竞赛运动中养了二千五百亩桑花萍作为绿肥，挖了二千多吨河泥，修建了一万三千米长的水渠。各农业社的宣传组在社员休息时宣传南方新春胜利喜讯，社员们听了以后干劲更加高涨。河西省福川、应和、清威等县成立了四百四十九个青年突击组，包括五千名男女青年，加强田间管理。福寿县的男女青年不分白天黑夜兴修水利，二十天共挖了一千七百一十八立方米土方。宁平省各地农业社的女社员在竞赛中走在前头。一万五千名妇女主动承担三千公顷离家远而且土质比较差的田地的施肥、灌溉工作。
    处于战斗最激烈地区的永灵、广平、河静、义安、清化等省的农业社员，在南方军民胜利的鼓舞下，更是斗志昂扬。这些省的青年们发动了“一切为了战胜美国侵略强盗”的竞赛运动。永灵区有一万四千二百六十名团员和青年参加了这一竞赛，负责管理三千三百多公顷早稻，力争获得高产。他们新修了十二万八千立方米土方的水利工程，保证稻田有足够的水。义安省琼留、义路、演州等县各农业社成立许多突击队，负责到敌机轰炸最激烈的地区劳动，杜良、南坛、威峰、义坛等县农业社员，在敌机轰炸、敌舰炮击的情况下，已经完成第一遍除草任务。为了争取早稻获得好收成，各地农业社都还普遍重视施肥工作。（附图片）
