Our great teacher Chairman Mao's "Statement Supporting the American Blacks in Their Struggle Against Violent Repression" is not only the greatest encouragement and support for the American blacks' struggle against violent repression but also the greatest encouragement and support for all revolutionary peoples of the world. The statement expresses the thoughts in our hearts, the poor and lower-middle peasants. We support it one thousand times, ten thousand times.

Chairman Mao teaches us that the various oppressions inflicted by the reactionaries of all countries on the revolutionary people "will, in the end, only serve to promote more extensive, more violent and more determined revolution." The American blacks are at the bottom of American society, suffering the deepest and heaviest exploitation and oppression. Many American blacks are unemployed, and even those who manage to find jobs still live in semi-starvation. They reside in filthy, overcrowded slums. The suffering of our American black brothers is the suffering of class oppression. This situation, we poor and lower-middle peasants who have experienced hardship in the old society, deeply understand. Now, our American black brothers, due to the racial discrimination policies of U.S. imperialism, suffer even more. They are regarded as inferior people. In name, they are American citizens, but in reality, they not only lack the rights of citizens but also their lives are not guaranteed. They can be arrested or killed at any time. The broad masses of American blacks truly live in hell!

Where there is oppression, there is resistance. The more severe the oppression, the stronger the resistance. The unprecedented scale of the American blacks' struggle against violent repression this time is the result of the long-term brutal oppression and exploitation of American blacks by the American reactionary ruling clique.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people who have won victory in their revolution should support the people who are still struggling for liberation. This is our internationalist duty." We, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Xia Xinbao, will definitely remember Chairman Mao's great teachings, grasp the revolution, and vigorously promote production. We will fight a brilliant battle in the spring plowing and sowing, and support the American black brothers' struggle against violent repression with practical actions.

    压迫越厉害　反抗越强烈
    中阿友好公社下新堡生产队贫下中农
    我们伟大的导师毛主席《支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明》，不仅是对美国黑人抗暴斗争的最大鼓舞和最大支持，也是对全世界一切革命人民的最大鼓舞和最大支持。声明说出了我们贫下中农的心里话，我们一千个拥护，一万个拥护。
    毛主席教导我们说，各国反动派“对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”美国黑人处在美国社会的最底层，他们受的剥削和压迫最深最重。美国黑人大批失业，就是那些侥幸找到职业的人，也仍然过着半饥半饱的生活。他们住的是又脏又挤的贫民窟。美国黑人兄弟受的苦，是阶级压迫的苦。这种情况，我们在旧社会受过苦的贫下中农，是深有体会的。现在的美国黑人兄弟，由于美帝国主义推行种族歧视，受的苦比我们过去还多一层。他们被看成是下等人，名义上是美国公民，实际上不但没有公民的权利，而且连生命都没有保障，他们随时可能被逮捕、被杀害。美国广大黑人真是生活在地狱之中啊！
    有压迫就有反抗，压迫越厉害，反抗也越强烈。美国黑人兄弟这次规模空前的抗暴斗争，是美国反动统治集团长期对美国黑人实行残酷的压迫和剥削的结果。
    毛主席教导说：“已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争，这是我们的国际主义的义务。”我们下新堡的贫下中农一定牢记毛主席的伟大教导，狠抓革命，猛促生产，在春耕春种中打个漂亮仗，以实际行动支援美国黑人兄弟的抗暴斗争。
