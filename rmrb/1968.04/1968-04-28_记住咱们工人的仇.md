Remember the Grievances of Our Workers

	By an old miner from the Méntoúgōu Coal Mine, Sūn Shùlín

	The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Never forget class struggle." Yet China's Khrushchev sings a different tune from Chairman Mao, absurdly claiming: "In our country, large-scale class struggle has passed. Capitalists, landlords, and rich peasants will all enter socialism," and "Now we have already eliminated classes." This traitor to the working class, why does he keep pushing the "theory of the extinction of class struggle"? It is to make us forget the bitterness of the old society, forget our hatred for the class enemies, forget class struggle, forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, lose our vigilance in class struggle, so that they can boldly carry out capitalist restoration and throw us back into the abyss.

	To forget the past means to betray. The working class suffered the most severe exploitation and oppression in the old society, endured the deepest hardships. We will never forget the crimes of the old society, never forget our hatred for the class enemies. The old society and the exploiting classes are forever our sworn enemies.

	In the old society, my family had three generations working in the coal mines. My grandfather was crushed to death. My father and older brother worked until their bones ached, but still couldn't feed our family of eight or nine. My mother had to take me, my younger sister, and three younger brothers to beg for food. Two of my younger brothers starved to death, and one fell ill and lay on the kang. My mother, enduring her heartache, sold my nine-year-old sister to be a child bride in exchange for two piculs of corn. Later, I was also forced to work as a child laborer, pulling coal with my older brother, enduring the hardships of beasts of burden. When I was thirteen, I broke my fingers and injured my head. Not only did I not get any medical treatment, but I still had to go down into the mine to work. Even so, we were still exhausted outside and starving at home. One year on New Year's Eve, my younger brother, who had been sick for several years, saw the mine owner's family celebrating with red lanterns and wine, and asked my mother for a steamed bun to eat. My father and I worked two shifts in a row, came back and bought half a jin of corn flour, rushed home, and my mother made steamed buns and gave them to my younger brother. My younger brother shook his head weakly and said, "Mother, I won't eat it. Save it for Father and my older brother, so they can go to work in the mine!" That day, my poor younger brother breathed his last. Just after the New Year, my younger sister also starved to death. My father had no shoes, wrapped his feet, and they swelled like a piece of wood. The mine owner still forced him to work. My father refused, and the mine owner, crueler than a wolf, beat my father until his legs and waist were broken, and his clothes were beaten into his flesh. Before he died, he grabbed my hand and said, "Son, remember the grievances of our workers!" My mother cried herself sick, with no food or medicine, and soon died. In the old society, the exploiting class took the lives of seven members of my family, causing us workers to be separated by life and death, our family to be destroyed. It was only under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao that we overthrew the three great mountains oppressing us, jumped out of the fire pit, became the masters of the new society, and have the good life we have today.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must not think that the counter-revolutionary forces have become revolutionary just because they have submitted to us. Their counter-revolutionary thoughts and counter-revolutionary intentions still exist." "They are not reconciled to the loss of their country and the advent of communism.... Class struggle is an objective existence, not subject to the will of man." In the more than ten years since liberation, the exploiting class has always dreamed of restoring their lost "paradise," and class struggle has never stopped. China's Khrushchev first chants a "spell," shouting "Now we have already eliminated classes," trying to make us forget the bitterness of the old society, forget classes and class struggle; then he performs a "sleight of hand," shouting "Capitalists, landlords, and rich peasants will all enter socialism," dressing up these man-eating wolves in human skin, making them up as "socialists," so that we cannot see the true face of the class enemies, covering up their attacks on the dictatorship of the proletariat, and carrying out capitalist restoration. Let me tell you, China's Khrushchev, you are dreaming in broad daylight, and even if you blind your dog eyes, it won't work! We workers who have suffered the torments of the old society, the blood and tears of the old society, and the hatred of classes are all deeply engraved in our hearts, never to be forgotten. Whoever dares to restore the old society of cannibalism, we will fight to the death with him, and even tearing him into eight pieces will not satisfy our hatred! Those who have drunk our blood and eaten our flesh, even if they die and turn to ashes, we will still recognize what they are. No matter how much you dress them up, put on as many layers of human skin, we will still see through them! We are the working class armed with Mao Zedong Thought. No matter how many tricks you have, like the White Bone Spirit, you will not escape our discerning eyes. No matter how many skills you have for restoring capitalism, you will not escape the iron fists of the working class!

    记住咱们工人的仇
    门头沟煤矿老矿工　孙树林
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”。中国赫鲁晓夫却和毛主席唱对台戏，胡说：“在我国，大规模的阶级斗争已经过去。资本家、地主、富农都将进入社会主义”，“现在我们已经消灭了阶级。”这个大工贼为啥一个劲儿鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭”论？就是要我们忘掉旧社会的苦，忘掉对阶级敌人的恨，忘掉阶级斗争，忘掉无产阶级专政，丧失阶级斗争警惕性，好让他们放心大胆地去搞资本主义复辟，再把我们打入十八层地狱。
    忘记过去就意味着背叛。我们工人阶级在旧社会受剥削受压迫最重，受苦受难最深，我们到啥时候也忘不了旧社会的罪，忘不了对阶级敌人的仇。旧社会、剥削阶级永远是我们的死对头。
    旧社会，我家三辈下煤窑。爷爷被砸死。爸爸、哥哥累断了筋骨，也糊不上全家八九口人的嘴，妈妈只好领着我、妹妹和三个弟弟去要饭。两个弟弟被活活饿死，一个饿得病倒在炕上。母亲忍着心疼把九岁的妹妹卖给人家当童养媳，换来两斗玉米。后来我也被逼去当童工，和哥哥一块儿下井蹬铁板（拉煤），受够牛马苦。我十三岁那年，砸断了手指，砸伤了头，不但没钱治，还得照样下井干活。就是这样，还是外边累断膀子，家里饿断肠子。有一年大年三十，病倒好几年的小弟弟看到把头家灯红酒绿地过年，向母亲要个窝窝头吃。我和父亲连上两个班，回来买了半斤玉米面，赶到家里，母亲做了窝头，递给弟弟，弟弟摇摇头，有气无力地说：“娘，我不吃了，留给爸爸哥哥，吃了好下矿！”当天，可怜的弟弟就断了气。刚过了年，小妹妹也饿死了。父亲没鞋穿，扎了脚，肿得象根木头，把头还是硬逼着他去干活，父亲不依，比狼还狠的把头把父亲打得腿断腰折，衣服都被打到肉里，没等死就被拖出屋子。父亲临死拉住我的手说：“孩子，记住咱们工人的仇！”母亲哭病了，没吃没药，很快也死了。旧社会，剥削阶级夺去我家七口人的生命，害得我们工人生离死别，家破人亡。共产党、毛主席领导我们推翻了压在我们身上的三座大山，我们才跳出火坑，做了新社会的主人，有了今天的好日子。
    毛主席教导我们：“决不可以认为反革命力量顺从我们了，他们就成了革命党了，他们的反革命思想和反革命企图就不存在了。”“他们对于亡国、共产是不甘心的。……阶级斗争是客观存在，不依人的意志为转移的。”解放十几年来，剥削阶级一直在梦想恢复他们失去的“天堂”，阶级斗争一刻也没有停止。中国赫鲁晓夫先念一个“迷魂咒”，大喊“现在我们已经消灭了阶级”，想让我们忘记旧社会的苦，忘记阶级和阶级斗争；随后施出一个“障眼法”，大叫“资本家、地主、富农都将进入社会主义”，给这群吃人的豺狼披上人皮，把他们打扮成“社会主义者”，好让我们看不清阶级敌人的真面目，掩护着他们向无产阶级专政进攻，搞资本主义复辟。告诉你，中国赫鲁晓夫，你这是大白天做鬼梦，熬瞎了你的狗眼也没门！我们受尽旧社会煎熬的工人阶级，旧社会的血泪仇、阶级恨宗宗件件都刻在我们的心头，永生永世忘不了，谁妄想恢复那吃人的旧社会，我们就豁了命和他拚，把他撕成八瓣也解不了我们的恨！喝过我们血，吃过我们肉的资本家、地主、富农就是死了烧成灰，我们也认得出他们是什么东西，不论你怎样替他们梳妆打扮，给他们披上多少层人皮，我们也能一眼把他看穿！我们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级，任凭你有白骨精的多变的妖术，也躲不过我们的火眼金睛，任凭你有复辟资本主义的十八般武艺，也逃不脱我们工人阶级的铁拳！
