The Beijing Military Region Air Force Unit's Revolutionary Criticism Wall Newspaper Selections

The training of new drivers in the Motorized Platoon: is it about emphasizing politics or emphasizing technology? This is a struggle between two military ideologies and two military lines. On this issue, Political Instructor Gu Jinglan has had profound lessons, saying:

Always Walk the Path of Emphasizing Politics

Under the influence of the poisonous mist of the "technology first" and "military is politics" advocated by the agent of the Chinese Khrushchev, Luo Ruiqing, some cadres in our platoon, in order to quickly train new drivers, were once busy all day with business matters, emphasizing technology. As a result, not only did the technology not improve, but ideological problems emerged. After the Party branch discovered this problem, it immediately convened a committee meeting and a branch meeting, allowing everyone to discuss, "Where should our focus be?" Everyone agreed: We were busy in the past, but we were not busy with the fundamentals. We only focused on "business" and "emphasizing technology," neglecting the study of Chairman Mao's works. This was a wrong direction. Chairman Mao criticized the fallacy of "military is politics" as early as 1929, but we almost got blown off course by the poisonous mist and headed down the path of pure militarism.

After finding the fundamental reason why technology did not improve, we always kept our focus on emphasizing politics, putting the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works at the forefront of all work. We firmly grasped the use of Mao Zedong Thought to transform people and promote the revolutionary transformation of people's thinking, which is the politics within politics, the soul within the soul, and the core within the core. New drivers took "Three Articles" as their motto and truly drove for the revolution. By holding the "gate" of emphasizing politics, technology also quickly passed the "gate," breaking the old rules that new drivers must train for more than eight months and drive 1,200 kilometers before they can perform tasks alone. They only used four months and drove about 600 kilometers before they were assigned to follow the team.

Ironclad facts tell us that focusing on emphasizing politics and the revolutionary transformation of people's thinking can produce great spiritual and material results. Conversely, following Luo Ruiqing's bourgeois military line will make people become confused about business and indifferent to politics, and will inevitably change our proletarian army. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and always walk the path of emphasizing politics.

The Supply Section, which had never been close to the "Four Good" for many years, was evaluated as "Four Good" for the first time last year. Reflecting on the past journey, Political Instructor Xi Xiule deeply realized:

Emphasizing Politics Achieved a Turnaround

The agent of the Chinese Khrushchev, Luo Ruiqing, absurdly claimed that politics and military are "equally important" and should be "emphasized alternately." This is sheer revolutionary compromise.

In the past few years, some cadres mistakenly believed that the Supply Section was just about food and clothing. As long as the cooking technology was good and the diners were satisfied, our task would be well done. Thus, cadres would squat at each stove to "inspect," and call skilled comrades to pass on skills at each stove. However, the harder they worked, the more they failed, and accidents happened frequently, with many complaints. We brought this problem to the serious study of Chairman Mao's teachings on "political work is the lifeline of all economic work" and Lin Biao's "five principles of emphasizing politics." We fully mobilized the masses, carried out great debates, and traced the root causes. Everyone said that the work was not done well, and the fundamental reason was not emphasizing politics and not grasping the revolutionary transformation of people's thinking. From then on, we kicked out the "military is politics" rubbish and firmly decided to emphasize proletarian politics and grasp the revolutionary transformation of people's thinking.

Last year, some cadres participated in the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work and went out on duty, leaving only three or four cooks for over a hundred people to eat, and most of them were new soldiers who had just joined the army, with relatively low skills. In the face of heavy tasks with few people and poor skills, we proposed a stove change plan to save more coal and support national construction. We studied and applied "Three Articles" vigorously, made resolutions, and wrote guarantees, willing to take on a thousand-pound burden for the revolution. When there were not enough bricks for the stove change, we did not ask the state for help but picked them up ourselves; when there were not enough stove bars, we made them ourselves. Comrades treated the stove change as a battlefield for criticizing and repudiating revisionism and the private self, and the kitchen as a furnace for tempering loyalty. The entire section presented a scene of cadres and soldiers actively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, with a red wave inside and outside the stove.

With red hearts and roaring fires, after arduous efforts, we not only successfully completed the entire stove change task but also saved more than 150 tons of coal for the state in the second half of the year alone, and improved the meals. Relying on emphasizing proletarian politics, we fought a turnaround battle and were evaluated as "Four Good" for the first time at the end of the year.

The stark contrast before and after told us: politics is always the commander, the soul. Military technology is important, but it cannot be compared with politics. We have decided to walk the path of emphasizing proletarian politics, emphasizing it year after year, and passing it down from generation to generation.

What to Grasp First in Flight Training?

In flight training, grasp the revolutionary transformation of the pilots' thinking first, use Mao Zedong Thought to command the flight training, and improve the combat effectiveness of the troops.

Deputy Squadron Leader Wang Zhenxue deeply realized:

Politics Must Always Be Placed First

The counter-revolutionary revisionist Luo Ruiqing attempted to lead us astray with the reactionary fallacy of "if military and technology are well done, it is emphasizing politics." This is in vain.

In the past, I once relaxed the grasp of the revolutionary transformation of people's thinking, only paying attention to the pilots' "stick and rudder," counting training time, counting the number of flights, and counting the number of rings and points. As a result, everyone's mind was only about the number of times, hours, and points, neglecting how to actively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in training and achieve the revolutionary transformation of people's thinking.

Lin Biao's call to "raise the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level" raised my awareness. I followed Lin Biao's instructions to grasp the fundamentals among the myriad of things, walk the path of emphasizing politics, and let Mao Zedong Thought command the troops' thinking and the entire process of flight training. In the entire flight training, actively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, cultivate unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao.

Mao Zedong Thought is deeply rooted in the pilots' minds, and in critical moments, it can stand the test. In a flight training session, Squadron Leader Li Wende, just after joining the flight path, suddenly had the cockpit cover fall off. At this time, everyone was discussing: This is bad, it's cold and windy outside, can we return? We have to jump out and crash the plane, otherwise, we will be destroyed. In this situation, I firmly believed: People armed with Mao Zedong Thought have the reddest hearts and the greatest courage, and can overcome all difficulties. At this critical moment, although Comrade Li Wende needed technical guidance, he more needed Mao Zedong Thought to give him courage and wisdom. Without hesitation, I sent him Mao Zedong's teachings: "Make up your mind, do not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." Comrade Li Wende, following Chairman Mao's teachings, bravely, fearlessly, and calmly operated the plane, finally safely returning to the airport. This example is a powerful refutation of Luo Ruiqing's fallacy of opposing the emphasis on politics, making me more clearly realize: using Mao Zedong Thought to command everything and guide everything is to grasp the fundamentals of troop building. We must listen to Chairman Mao and always put emphasizing politics first.

What to Pass First?

The counter-revolutionary revisionist Luo Ruiqing absurdly said: "If you do not grasp technology, you will not pass; if you do not grasp politics, the sky will not collapse." Pfft! This is a blatant exposure of his ugly face of opposing the emphasis on politics. Revolutionary soldiers will not fall for his tricks. Deputy Director of the Meteorological Station Wu Changcheng in meteorological forecasting work:

First Pass the Political Test

The agent of the Chinese Khrushchev, Luo Ruiqing, did everything to oppose emphasizing politics. In meteorological work, he set up five "tests" for weather forecasting: forecasting the weather for two days as the "long-term test," forecasting the weather for one day as the "short-term test," forecasting the weather for three hours as the "preparation for flight test," etc., with countless absurd tests. These tests all required cadres to personally supervise, saying that cadres should make the "tests" more precise. Cadres, in order to make the "tests" more precise, were busy dealing with business all day. This was clearly turning cadres into business-minded, politically indifferent mediocrities?

Passing the political "test" or the technical "test" is a struggle between the two military lines and two military ideologies of our army. In the past, I once thought that "technology" was the key "test," and as a technical cadre, passing the "technical test" was a duty. As for politics, I thought it was okay to be a bit weak. The result of not emphasizing politics was not only that the "technical test" was not passed well, but also frequent errors, and lessons were learned the hard way. Deep lessons made us seriously study Chairman Mao's teachings that politics is the commander and the soul, and Lin Biao's instructions that "politics must not be forgotten and must not be neglected." From then on, we vigorously grasped the study of Chairman Mao's works, armed our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and treated every work process as a process of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and criticizing and repudiating revisionism. The troops' ideological appearance underwent a fundamental change, and the work tasks were completed better and better.

Once, during a large-scale combat readiness exercise, everything was ready, except for the "east wind." Our meteorological station's report on the weather's good or bad would directly affect whether this combat readiness exercise could be carried out smoothly. At this critical moment of great responsibility, was it to first pass the "technical test" or the "political test"? I did not hesitate to first pass the "political test," organizing everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our responsibility is to the people," firmly holding this ideological "master switch." Great spiritual power turned into great material power. Comrades raised their awareness, changing "fear" into "dare," with a high sense of responsibility for the revolution, through hard and meticulous work, finally accurately reported the weather, ensuring that the troops successfully completed this combat readiness exercise.

Practice tells us that only passing the "technical test" is like a blind man walking, with no clear direction. Like an airplane deviating from its course, the faster it goes, the further it is from Chairman Mao's military line. Only by passing the "political test" can one command everything and promote everything, and eliminate all interference that does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought. Ten thousand "tests," a hundred thousand "tests," emphasizing politics is the most fundamental "test," the most important "test." By holding this ideological "master switch," all "technical tests" will be broken through. The "technical test" advocated by the counter-revolutionary revisionist Luo Ruiqing is a thorough revisionist "test," a bourgeois "test." We not only do not pass this "test," but we will thoroughly destroy this "test."

What to Rely on in Critical Moments?

The counter-revolutionary revisionist Luo Ruiqing advocated "skill brings courage," claiming that with "skill" comes courage, and without solid technology, one cannot be firm in critical moments. Nonsense! This is turning black into white. Pilot Wang Kesong, through handling an in-flight accident, deeply felt:

Rely on People's Awareness

Great Leader Mao Zedong taught us: "The decisive factor is people, not things." Lin Biao also instructed: "Our army has always relied on people's political awareness and courage to fight."

Last year, during a night flight training, my plane was performing a maneuver over a village when the engine suddenly stopped. The plane was at an altitude of six kilometers, descending at a speed of 17.8 meters per second. At that time, I did not have the technology to drive in the clouds during the day, let alone the technology to drive in the clouds at night under complex weather conditions. In such a critical moment, it was Chairman Mao's teachings that gave me strength, and it was the invincible Mao Zedong Thought that gave me courage and wisdom. I thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our responsibility is to the people," "Make up your mind, do not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." Suddenly, I felt that the dark night sky was lit up by a brilliant red sun, my blood boiled, and a warm current surged, my eyes brightened, and the direction was clear. I thought: As long as I can protect state property and the safety of people's lives, even if it means sacrificing my own life, I am willing. This made me calm and not panic, enhancing my high sense of responsibility. I finally succeeded in driving the plane, avoiding a serious accident that was about to happen. This is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Ironclad facts eloquently prove: only people armed with Mao Zedong Thought can display superb technology and create miracles. Doing revolution does not rely on heaven or earth, but on Mao Zedong Thought and the revolutionary soldiers' loyalty to Chairman Mao. With the character "loyalty" in mind, one can be brave and fearless, and march forward to strive for victory.

Luo Ruiqing's advocacy of "skill brings courage" is just a piece of junk picked from the bourgeois garbage dump. Revolutionary soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought will not fall for his tricks. We have only one mind: resolutely walk the path of ideological revolution, let the boundless Mao Zedong Thought command our every word and deed, and let us forever soar in the sky of our motherland along the path illuminated by the red sun!

What Kind of Achievements Do We Want?

Soldier Meng Qingzhu's fearless revolutionary spirit in a firefighting battle dealt a crushing blow to the reactionary fallacy advocated by the counter-revolutionary revisionist Luo Ruiqing that "only by improving military training can combat effectiveness be effectively improved." His platoon leader, Qu Fengyi, said:

People Armed with Mao Zedong Thought Are the Greatest Combat Effectiveness

The Chinese Khrushchev vigorously advocated that technology "decides everything." The counter-revolutionary revisionist Luo Ruiqing also said: "Only by improving military training can combat effectiveness be effectively improved." Pfft! These are all fallacies.

Soldier Meng Qingzhu once scored a "pass" in a shooting exercise. Different views emerged on this issue: some comrades completely ignored Meng Qingzhu's political performance, believing that Meng Qingzhu could not even hit a stationary target in peacetime, and would definitely not be able to stand firm in battle against a cunning enemy, and were very worried about him. However, the majority of comrades believed: Meng Qingzhu, although he scored a "pass," diligently studied Chairman Mao's works, armed his mind with Mao Zedong Thought, and was loyal to Chairman Mao. This is the primary factor for being firm in battle. Mao Zedong Thought is an incredibly powerful spiritual atomic bomb, a powerful ideological weapon for defeating the enemy. With Mao Zedong Thought, one has the greatest courage, and even if the first shot in battle does not eliminate the enemy, one can shoot the second shot, the third shot. Even if one is unarmed, one will fight to the death with the enemy, eliminate the enemy, and achieve victory. If one does not emphasize politics and does not have Mao Zedong Thought in one's mind, even if one's skills are excellent and one's abilities are great, scoring "excellent" every time in peacetime, one will run away when facing the enemy in battle. Such "excellence," no matter how many there are, will not be firm and will not be able to defeat the enemy, let alone achieve victory.

Soon, a fire broke out at a chemical warehouse near the garrison. For a revolutionary soldier, fire is a command. The entire company rushed to the fire scene. Meng Qingzhu was at the forefront. He ran towards the raging flames, reciting: "Make up your mind, do not be afraid of sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." He fearlessly rescued the materials in the flames, completely disregarding his personal safety, showing an indomitable revolutionary spirit of courage and selflessness.

A fire incident enlightened some comrades, exposing the reactionary nature of the counter-revolutionary revisionist Luo Ruiqing's opposition to emphasizing politics. Comrades deeply felt: the fire scene is the battlefield, and the fire is the enemy. Meng Qingzhu, facing the raging flames, showed selflessness and fearlessness, great loyalty and courage. This is the result of arming the mind with Mao Zedong Thought, and is completely not something that can be achieved by relying on technical "excellence." Those with bourgeois ideas in their minds, no matter how skilled they are, will tremble and weaken in the face of the enemy and the fire, and run away. What use is such technical excellence? We want Meng Qingzhu's "pass," not the "excellent" that does not emphasize politics. Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeblood of our revolutionary soldiers, the soul of our revolutionary soldiers. The counter-revolutionary revisionist Luo Ruiqing's crimes of opposing the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works and opposing the emphasis on politics must be thoroughly settled.

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把革命的大批判进行到底
    北京部队空军某部革命大批判墙报选登
    汽车连培养新司机，是突出政治，还是突出技术？这是两种建军思想、两条建军路线的斗争。在这个问题上，指导员顾景岚有过深刻的教训，他说：
    永远走突出政治的路
    在中国赫鲁晓夫的代理人罗瑞卿的“技术第一”、“军事就是政治”的妖风毒雾影响下，我们连有些干部为了尽快地培养出新司机来，一度成天忙于抓业务，突出技术。结果，技术不但没有提高，思想问题却冒了出来。党支部发觉这个问题后，立即召开了支委会和支部大会，让大家讨论“我们的着眼点究竟要放在那里？”大家认为：我们过去忙，就是没有忙在根本上，只顾“抓业务”，“突出技术”，而忽视了毛主席著作的学习，这是抓错了方向。毛主席在一九二九年就批判了“军事就是政治”的谬论，可是我们差一点被妖风吹迷，走上单纯军事观点的道路。
    找到了技术上不去的根本原因，我们便始终把着眼点放在突出政治上面，把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，紧紧地抓住用毛泽东思想改造人、促进人的思想革命化这个政治中的政治，灵魂中的灵魂，核心中的核心。新司机以“老三篇”为座右铭，真正做到为革命开车。把住了突出政治的“关”，技术也很快地过了“关”，打破了过去那种新司机必须训练八个月以上，行驶一千二百公里才能单独执行任务的清规戒律，只用四个月时间，行驶六百公里左右就下排跟车了。
    铁的事实告诉我们，着眼点放在突出政治搞人的思想革命化上，就能出巨大的精神成果和物质成果。相反，按着罗瑞卿那一套资产阶级军事路线去搞，必然会使人们成为埋头业务、不问政治的糊涂虫，必然会使我们的无产阶级军队变质。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，永远走突出政治的路。
    给养科连年不沾四好边，去年第一次评上了四好，他们回顾过去走的路程，指导员席修乐深刻认识到：
    突出政治打了翻身仗
    中国赫鲁晓夫代理人罗瑞卿胡说政治和军事“同等重要”，要“轮流突出”。这是地地道道的反革命折衷主义。
    前几年，有的干部错误地认为，给养科就是管吃饭穿衣，只要烹调技术过硬，就餐人员满意，我们的任务就算很好地完成了。于是，干部就蹲在各灶“把关”，还叫手艺强的同志挨灶传艺。可是，劲使得越大越砸锅，事故不断发生，大家意见很多。我们带着这个问题认真学习了毛主席关于“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”和林副主席
  “突出政治的五项原则”的教导，充分发动群众，开展大辩论，追根溯源。大伙说，工作搞得不好，千条原因、万条原因，不突出政治、不抓人的思想革命化是最根本的原因。从此，我们一脚踢开了“军事就是政治”这摊破烂货，打定了一个心眼，坚定不移地突出无产阶级政治，狠抓人的思想革命化。
    去年，一些干部参加了“三支”“两军”工作和外出执勤，一百多号人吃饭，只剩了三四个炊事员，而且绝大多数是入伍不久的新战士，技术可算不高。在人少、技术差、任务重的情况下，我们为了多节约煤，支援国家建设，又提出了改灶的计划。我们狠学狠用“老三篇”，表决心、写保证，为革命愿挑千斤重担。改灶缺少砖，不向国家伸手，自己动手捡；缺少炉条，自己动手打。同志们把改灶当成斗私批修的战场，把伙房当成锻炼“忠”字的熔炉，全科呈现出干部战士人人活学活用毛泽东思想，灶内灶外一片红的革命景象。
    人心红，炉火旺，经过艰苦奋战，不但胜利完成了全部改灶任务，仅下半年就为国家节约了一百五十余吨煤，而且还改善了伙食。靠突出无产阶级政治，打了一场翻身仗，年终第一次被评为四好科。
    前后鲜明的对照告诉了我们：政治永远是统帅，是灵魂，军事技术是重要的，但绝不能和政治相提并论。突出无产阶级政治的路，我们走定了，年年突出，永远突出，世世代代往下传。
    在飞行训练中先抓什么？
    在飞行训练中先抓飞行员的思想革命化，用毛泽东思想指挥飞行训练，提高了部队的战斗力。
    飞行副中队长王振学深刻认识到：
    要把政治永远放在首位
    反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿妄图用什么“搞好了军事，搞好了技术，就是突出政治”的反动谬论把我们引上邪路。这是枉费心机。
    过去，我曾一度放松过抓人的思想革命化，只注意抓飞行员的“一杆两舵”，扣训练时间，扣飞行次数，扣打了几环、得了几分。结果使大家脑子里也只有次数、时数和分数，而忽视了如何在训练中活学活用毛泽东思想，实现人的思想革命化。
    林副主席发出的“把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到一个新阶段”的号召，提高了我的认识。我按林副主席千头万绪抓根本的指示，走突出政治的路，让毛泽东思想统帅部队的思想，指挥飞行训练的全过程。在整个飞行训练中活学活用毛泽东思想，培养对毛主席的无限忠诚。
    毛泽东思想在飞行员的头脑里扎得深，在关键时刻，就能过得硬。在一次飞行训练中，飞行中队长李文德驾着飞机刚加入航线，突然座舱盖掉了。这时，大家议论纷纷：这下可坏了，天冷风大，能回得来吗？非跳伞摔掉飞机不可，要不然会机毁人亡。在这种情况下，我坚信：用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，心最红，胆最大，一切困难都能克服。在这紧急关头，虽然李文德同志需要技术上的指挥，但更需要毛泽东思想给他勇敢和智慧。我毫不犹豫地给他传去了毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”李文德同志按照毛主席的教导，勇敢，不怕死，沉着果断地操纵着飞机，终于安全地飞回了机场。这一事例是对罗瑞卿反对突出政治的谬论的一个有力的回击，使我更清楚地认识到：用毛泽东思想统帅一切，指导一切，才是抓住了部队建设的根本。我们一定要听毛主席的话，永远把突出政治放在首位。
    首先过什么关？
    反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿胡说：“不抓技术过不了关，不抓政治塌不了天。”呸！这是不打自招地亮出了他反对突出政治的丑恶嘴脸。革命战士决不上他的当。气象台副台长吴长城在气象预报工作中：
    首先过政治关
    中国赫鲁晓夫的代理人罗瑞卿千方百计反对突出政治，在气象工作中预报天气一项设下了五道“关”：测报两天的天气状况为“长期关”、测报一天的天气状况为“短期关”、测报三小时的天气状况为“准备飞行关”等五花八门的关口，真是鬼名堂举不胜举。这些关口都要干部亲自出马督战，说什么干部把“关”精益求精。干部为了把“关”求精确度，整天忙于和业务打交道，这不明明是把干部变成成天埋头业务、不问政治的庸人吗？
    过政治“关”，还是过技术“关”，这是我军两条建军路线、两种建军思想的斗争。以前，我曾认为“技术”是关键的“关”，作为技术干部，把“技术关”是责无旁贷的，至于政治，觉得差一点没关系。不突出政治的结果，不但技术“关”没过好，还经常出错，吃了苦头。深刻的教训使我们认真学习了毛主席的政治是统帅，是灵魂的教导和林副主席的“一定不要忘记政治，不要忽视政治”的指示。从此，我们狠抓毛主席著作的学习，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，把每项工作的过程都当成活学活用毛主席著作，斗私批修的过程。部队的思想面貌发生了根本变化，工作任务完成得越来越好。
    一次大部队战备演习，一切工作就绪，只欠“东风”了，我们气象台报告天气的好坏，将直接影响这次战备演习能否顺利进行。在这责任重大的关键时刻，是先把“技术关”，还是先把“政治关”？我毫不犹豫地先把“政治关”，针对一些同志的畏难依赖情绪，组织大家学习了毛主席的教导：“我们的责任，是向人民负责”，坚定地把住了这个思想“总开关”。伟大的精神力量变成了巨大的物质力量。同志们提高了觉悟，变“怕”字为“敢”字，以对革命高度负责的精神，通过刻苦细致的工作，终于准确地报告了天气，保证部队圆满完成了这次战备演习任务。
    实践告诉我们，只把“技术关”，就象瞎子走路，方向不明。象飞机偏航一样，速度越大，离毛主席的建军路线越远。只有把好“政治关”，才能统帅一切，推动一切，才能排除一切不符合毛泽东思想的干扰。千道“关”，万道“关”，突出政治是最根本的“关”，是最重要的“关”。把好了这个思想“总开关”，一切“技术关”就会全部突破。反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿鼓吹的“技术关”是地地道道的修正主义的“关”，资产阶级的“关”。我们非但不过这个“关”，还要彻底摧毁这道“关”。
    关键时刻靠什么过硬？
    反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿宣扬“艺高人胆大”，有了“艺”就有胆，没有过硬的技术，关键时刻就不能过硬。住口！这是颠倒黑白。飞行员王克松通过处理一次空中事故，他深有体会地说：
    主要靠人的觉悟
  伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“决定的因素是人不是物”。林副主席也指示：“我们军队打仗，历来靠人的政治觉悟，靠勇敢”。
    去年，我在一次夜航训练中，飞机在一片村庄上空作科目，突然发动机停车了，飞机在六千米的高空，以每秒十七点八米的速度往下掉。当时我既没有在白天云中开车的技术，更没有在夜间复杂气候条件下云中开车的技术。处在这样的紧要关头，是毛主席的教导给了我力量，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想给了我勇敢和智慧。我想起毛主席的教导：“我们的责任，是向人民负责”，“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”顿时，觉得漆黑的夜空升起了光芒万丈的红太阳，全身热血沸腾，暖流滚滚，眼亮了，方向明了。我想：只要能保卫国家财产，保卫人民的生命安全，就是牺牲自己的生命，我也心甘情愿。这样，使我沉着而不慌乱，增强了高度的责任感。我终于开车成功了，一场即将发生的严重事故避免了。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。铁的事实雄辩地证明：只有用毛泽东思想武装起来的勇敢的人，才能发挥高超的技术，才能创造奇迹。干革命不靠天，不靠地，靠毛泽东思想，靠革命战士对毛主席的一个“忠”字。脑子里有了“忠”字，就能勇敢不怕死，就能勇往直前，争取胜利。
    罗瑞卿鼓吹的“艺高人胆大”，只不过是从资产阶级的垃圾堆里拾来的破烂货。用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命战士，决不上他的当。我们只有一个心眼：坚决走思想革命化的路，让光焰无际的毛泽东思想指挥我们的一言一行，使我们永远沿着红太阳照亮的航程飞翔在祖国的天空！
    要什么样的成绩？
    战士孟庆祝在一次救火战斗中所表现的大无畏的革命精神，给了反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿所鼓吹的“只要把军事训练搞好，才能有效地提高战斗力”的反动谬论以毁灭性的打击。他的排长曲风义说：
    毛泽东思想武装起来的人是最大的战斗力
    中国赫鲁晓夫极力鼓吹技术“决定一切”。反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿也说什么：“只要把军事训练搞好，才能有效地提高战斗力。”呸！这统统是谬论。
    战士孟庆祝一次打靶得了个“及格”。在这个问题上产生了不同的看法：有的同志完全不看孟庆祝同志的政治表现，认为孟庆祝平时连个死靶都打不准，到战场上和狡猾的敌人搏斗就一定不能过硬，很为他担心。但绝大多数的同志认为：孟庆祝虽然是打了个“及格”，但他勤奋地学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，忠于毛主席，这才是战场上过硬的首要的因素。毛泽东思想是威力无比的精神原子弹，是克敌制胜的强大的思想武器。有了毛泽东思想，就有最大的勇敢，就是在战场上第一枪消灭不了敌人，可以打第二枪，第三枪。那怕手无寸铁，也会和敌人死打硬拚，消灭敌人，取得胜利。如果不突出政治，头脑里没有毛泽东思想，平时技术再好，本事再大，每次射击都是“优秀”，到了战场，看到敌人就会往后跑，这样的“优秀”再多也过不了硬，更谈不上克敌制胜。
    不久，驻地某化学仓库发生了火灾。对于一个革命战士来说，火光就是命令。全连奋勇向火场奔去。孟庆祝跑在最前边。他朝着熊熊的烈火一边跑一边朗读：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”他奋不顾身，一次又一次地抢救着烈火中的物资，把个人安危完全置之度外，表现了英勇顽强的革命大无畏精神。
    一场火灾，擦亮了一些同志的眼睛，揭穿了反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿反对突出政治的反动性。同志们深深地体会到：火场就是战场，火灾就是敌人。孟庆祝同志面对着熊熊的烈火，表现了无私无畏，大忠大勇。这是用毛泽东思想武装头脑的结果，完全不是靠什么技术“优秀”所能办到的。满脑子资产阶级思想的人，不管他技术有多么高明，在敌人面前，在火灾面前，他必然是浑身发颤，两腿发软，向后逃跑，这样的技术过硬有什么用呢？我们要孟庆祝这样的“及格”，不要不突出政治的“优秀”。毛泽东思想是我们革命战士的命根子，是我们革命战士的灵魂。反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿反对活学活用毛主席著作、反对突出政治的滔天罪行，我们要彻底清算。
