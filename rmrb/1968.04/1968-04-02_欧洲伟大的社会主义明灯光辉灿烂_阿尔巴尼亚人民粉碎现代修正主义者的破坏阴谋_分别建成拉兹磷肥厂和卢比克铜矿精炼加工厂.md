The Albanian people have smashed the sabotage plots of modern revisionists and built the Lazh Phosphatic Fertilizer Factory and the Lubinik Copper Ore Refining and Processing Plant.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Tirana, shortly after the Fieri Nitrogen Fertilizer Factory began production, the second fertilizer factory in Albania—the Lazh Phosphatic Fertilizer Factory—held a grand ceremony on March 24 to mark its commencement of operations.

On that day, the magnificent and enormous factory buildings of the Lazh Phosphatic Fertilizer Factory were adorned with giant portraits of the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha. Thousands of workers, members of agricultural cooperatives, soldiers and officers of the People's Army, cadres, and students from the Kruja District, carrying portraits of Chairman Mao and Comrade Hoxha, red flags, and banners, arrived early in the morning.

Among those attending the ceremony were: Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and Secretary of the Central Secretariat, Kadri Hazbiu; Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and Deputy Prime Minister of the Council of Ministers, Spiro Koleka; Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and Chairman of the State Planning Commission, Koço Theodhosi; and other relevant department heads.

Chinese Charge d'Affaires to Albania, Li Tingwen, and others were also invited to attend the ceremony.

At 10 a.m., the mass rally began. Comrade Theodhosi first, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, the Council of Ministers, and the beloved leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, extended warm congratulations to the builders of this factory and the people of Kruja. He praised the workers of this factory for their revolutionary spirit and selfless labor, completing the Lazh Phosphatic Fertilizer Factory six months ahead of schedule.

He said: The moral, political, and economic internationalist support and aid provided by the glorious Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and our greatest friend, Comrade Mao Zedong, are the decisive external factors for our successful construction of socialism and the completion of the tasks of our third five-year plan. The modern revisionists led by the Soviet revisionists have done everything possible to obstruct and sabotage our third five-year plan and the socialist construction of our country. However, under the leadership of the Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha, our people have bravely advanced, smashed the evil plots of the modern revisionists and imperialists, and achieved brilliant results in political, ideological, and organizational terms. Theodhosi also warmly praised the series of brilliant victories achieved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the leadership of the great leader, Chairman Mao.

Comrade Li Tingwen said in his speech: The Albanian Labor Party and the Albanian people adhere to the slogan of self-reliance, "one hand with a pickaxe, the other with a gun," to build socialism, defying the blockade and sabotage of imperialism and modern revisionism, and in a short period of time, have transformed their country from a backward agricultural country into an advanced socialist country with modern industry and collective agriculture. As our great leader, Chairman Mao, said: "Heroic Albania, a great socialist beacon in Europe." This great socialist beacon is shining more brilliantly.

In their speeches, Comrade Theodhosi and Comrade Li Tingwen warmly praised the revolutionary friendship and fighting unity between the two parties, two countries, and two peoples of China and Albania, forged and tempered by the great leaders Chairman Mao and Comrade Enver Hoxha, and further consolidated and developed in the common struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and reaction.

After the meeting, Comrade Kadri Hazbiu cut the ribbon to mark the commencement of operations for this fertilizer factory and inspected the entire production process of the factory.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Tirana, the Lubinik Copper Ore Refining and Processing Plant in Albania held a ceremony on March 27 to mark its commencement of operations.

Albanian party and government leaders attending the ceremony included: Deputy Prime Minister of the Council of Ministers, Beqir Balluku, and Central Committee Secretary, Spiro Boriçi, among others. Chinese Charge d'Affaires to Albania, Li Tingwen, and Economic Counselor, Zhou Ping, were also invited to attend the ceremony.

Comrade Boriçi mentioned that Albania's copper industry has established a complete system from mining to smelting and processing. He said that the Lubinik Copper Ore Refining and Processing Plant is a major project built with the fraternal internationalist aid of the People's Republic of China.

In their speeches, Comrade Boriçi and Comrade Li Tingwen both warmly praised the revolutionary fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Albania, forged and tempered by the great leaders of the two countries, Chairman Mao Zedong and Comrade Enver Hoxha, and tested by time.
