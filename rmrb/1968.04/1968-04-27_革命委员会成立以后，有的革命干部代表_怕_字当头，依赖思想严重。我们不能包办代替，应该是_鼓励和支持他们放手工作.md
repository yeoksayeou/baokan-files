After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, some revolutionary cadres had the word "fear" at the forefront of their minds and had a severe dependence on others. We should not do everything for them; instead, we should encourage and support them to take the initiative in their work.

After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee in Jiexi County, the former deputy secretary of the county committee, Chen Caisheng, was elected as the deputy director of the Revolutionary Committee. Because he was afraid of making mistakes again, he was cautious in his work. Initially, I was also afraid that he might make mistakes soon after taking office and tarnish the reputation of the Revolutionary Committee, so I often gave him instructions. This only reinforced his dependence, making it difficult for him to do his work well.

Later, I repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Believe in and rely on the majority of cadres" and "We must be good at cherishing cadres.... This means letting them work with initiative and making them dare to take responsibility." I came to understand that after the leading cadres come forward, whether we do everything for them and lead them by the hand, or encourage and support them to work with initiative and creativity, is an important indicator of loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Therefore, I studied Chairman Mao's relevant teachings with him and encouraged him to take the initiative and work boldly.

Chairman Mao's teachings became a great driving force. Comrade Chen Caisheng then took the initiative in his work. He carried a backpack and walked up and down the mountains and villages, working together with poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadres to bravely shoulder the dual burdens of "carrying out the revolution and promoting production," making the spring plowing very successful.

    鼓励和支持他们放手工作

    揭西县革命委员会成立的时候，原县委副书记陈财源被选为革命委员会副主任。由于他怕再犯错误，所以工作起来前怕狼后怕虎。开始，我也怕他捅漏子，刚上任就给革命委员会抹灰，也总是“指点指点”。这就更助长了他的依赖思想，工作当然很难做好。
    后来，我反复学习了毛主席“相信和依靠干部的大多数。”“必须善于爱护干部。……这就是让他们放手工作，使他们敢于负责”的教导，明确认识到：领导干部站出来之后，是包办代替，扶着他们走，还是鼓励和支持他们放手工作，使他们发挥主动性和创造性，这是忠不忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的重要标志。于是，我就和他一起学习毛主席的有关教导，鼓励他积极负责，大胆工作。
    毛主席的教导化成了巨大的动力，陈财源同志从此在工作中积极负责起来。他背起背包步行上山下乡，与贫下中农和基层干部一起勇敢地挑起了“抓革命，促生产”两副重担，使春耕生产搞得很好。
