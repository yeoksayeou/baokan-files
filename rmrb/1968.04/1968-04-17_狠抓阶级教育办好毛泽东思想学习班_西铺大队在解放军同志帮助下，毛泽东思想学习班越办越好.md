Our great leader Chairman Mao, who is described as the "image of the entire nation," has praised the "poor and backward commune" of Xipu Brigade in Jianming People's Commune, Zunhua County, Hebei Province. With the help of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes have been established. Through these study classes, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres have further achieved ideological transformation, and their enthusiasm for revolution and production has grown stronger.

Emphasizing class education to raise proletarian consciousness

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Class struggle, once grasped, is effective." Emphasizing class education to raise the proletarian consciousness of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres is the key to running study classes well in rural areas. In Xipu Brigade, poor and lower-middle peasants make up 80 percent, and every household has a history of bitter tears. People describe the life here thirty years ago as: "Eat vegetables in the morning, eat chaff at noon, and drink thin porridge by moonlight at night." "The whole family shares one quilt, sleeping in a broken thatched house, changing clothes every three years." After liberation, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, Xipu Brigade has undergone earth-shaking changes. Comrade Wang Guozhan and the poor and lower-middle peasants of Xipu Brigade, following Chairman Mao's teachings, resolutely took the cooperative path, establishing a "poor and backward commune" with twenty-three impoverished peasant households. They carried forward the "poor and backward spirit," rapidly changing the old face of Xipu Brigade.

This earth-shaking change is the most vivid and profound teaching material for class education. Therefore, regardless of the form of study classes held in Xipu Brigade, class education is always the first lesson. Among the cadres, there was once a thought of "fear," "resentment," and "difficulty," with some wanting to give up their responsibilities. The brigade's cadre study class, targeting these active thoughts, organized cadres to recall and compare. Brigade leader Qu Huan originally felt that being a cadre was difficult, fearing criticism from the masses and complaints from his family, saying he would not do it anymore. After recalling and comparing, he couldn't sleep for several nights, repeatedly pondering Chairman Mao's teaching: "Never forget class struggle." He felt that he had forgotten the past, forgotten class and class struggle, and that he had fallen far behind Chairman Mao's requirements. In the study class, he said: "As a poor peasant and party member, if we don't do it, who will? Not wanting to hold power for the poor and lower-middle peasants is the greatest betrayal; wanting to give up responsibilities is the greatest disloyalty to Chairman Mao, actually falling for the tricks of class enemies and the Chinese Khrushchev." Through recalling, comparing, and thinking, the feelings of "fear," "resentment," and "difficulty" among the cadres quickly disappeared, and their awareness of holding and using power for the poor and lower-middle peasants increased. They straightened their backs, working together to shoulder the dual burdens of revolution and production.

In family study classes, class education is also a very important lesson. Over sixty-year-old poor peasant Wen Huazhi found that several of his children did not like eating leftovers and complained about sharing a quilt. He and his wife told the children: "Our family, in the past, had no house, no land, all our belongings could not fill a broken basket, and we moved seven times in one year. One year, by the twenty-eighth day of the twelfth lunar month, we still had to beg for food. Now, we eat more white flour in one year than we did in twenty years before liberation. Father and mother are nothing compared to Chairman Mao!" After recalling bitterness and tasting sweetness, the children understood what exploitation is, what oppression is, what revolution is, and they loved the collective, loved labor, and loved Chairman Mao even more.

Launching a mass movement of criticizing and repudiating revisionism

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation." Mao Zedong Thought study classes always insist on "criticizing and repudiating revisionism" as the guiding principle, leading everyone to consciously break with private interests and establish public interests, and work hard on transforming their worldview.

In the brigade's cadre study class, Comrade Wang Guozhan took the lead in exposing and criticizing his private thoughts, setting a living example for revolutionary cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants.

At the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary flames burned to Comrade Wang Guozhan. Initially, his ideological struggle was intense, and he had some misunderstandings. His family members also complained: "All this is because of being a cadre, not being a cadre would be more carefree and less offensive." For a moment, he felt wronged. After studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, he recalled from the Anti-Japanese War to after national liberation, how he and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants followed Chairman Mao's socialist path, established cooperatives, and achieved communalization. This was mainly due to Chairman Mao's brilliant leadership and the efforts of the broad revolutionary masses, and these achievements should not be credited to individuals. Revolutionary masses actively gave him advice, using revolutionary flames to burn away some of his shortcomings and errors, which was a higher demand for him to hold the power for the poor and lower-middle peasants. In the study class, he exposed his private thoughts and criticized them fiercely. He said: "I will definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words, not rely on past merits, and strive for new achievements!"

Comrade Wang Guozhan's action of exposing and criticizing his private thoughts inspired other cadres. Old poor peasant Wang Rong, who had begged for eight years in the old society, led the poor and lower-middle peasants to charge into battle at the initial stage of the Cultural Revolution, foiling the class enemies' plot. Later, he was elected as one of the main leaders of the brigade's leading group. At that time, he felt that the situation was stable, and he was already over sixty, finding it inconvenient to attend meetings, and worrying about incurring resentment by managing too many affairs, so he planned to quit. After studying Chairman Mao's teaching: "Without poor peasants, there would be no revolution," he repeatedly thought, not doing it was the greatest betrayal, and the greatest disloyalty to Chairman Mao. He declared: "Live to an old age, work to an old age, be loyal to Chairman Mao for life, and follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life!"

Cadres leading the masses, and the masses inspiring the cadres, the entire Xipu Brigade quickly launched a high tide of criticizing and repudiating revisionism. Community member Han Yuzhen's family of three generations, from the seventy-six-year-old elder to the eleven-year-old child, started a family study class in December last year, studying Chairman Mao's works together every day and criticizing and repudiating revisionism. Previously, Han Yuzhen always reminded her children not to forget to bring home sorghum stalks when they went to the fields. In the study class, the children gave her advice. She realized that this was not just a matter of a bundle of firewood, but a matter of guiding the next generation down which path. She actively made a self-criticism and also educated the whole family.

The children also established Mao Zedong Thought Red Guards study classes, taking the People's Liberation Army as an example, strictly demanding of themselves, sweeping the streets every morning, fetching water and sweeping the courtyards for the five guarantees, martyrs' families, and military families, and sometimes organizing their own criticism meetings. The children's changes also educated the adults. They said: "Sending the children to the study class to receive Mao Zedong Thought education, we are very satisfied!"

On the socialist path, achieving new merits

Chairman Mao teaches us to "grasp the key of class struggle" and "grasp the key of the struggle between socialism and capitalism." In the study classes, to implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the most fundamental thing is to highlight the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, which is to insist on the socialist direction.

At the beginning of the agricultural cooperativization movement, the twenty-three impoverished peasant households in Xipu Brigade had only three donkey legs; now they have a herd of mules, rubber-tired carts, water pumps, and tractors, everything is available. Some cadres developed a sense of complacency, thinking "good enough" and "reached the top." The cadre study class specifically addressed the problem of arrogance and complacency among some cadres.

Comrade Wang Guozhan led everyone to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's instructions on the establishment of cooperatives in Xipu Brigade, recalling the changes in Xipu Brigade over the past decade, and also recalling the poison and harm of the "three freedoms and one contract," "four freedoms," "work points in command," and "material incentives" promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Xipu. The more they thought about it, the more they felt they had let down the great leader Chairman Mao, and they resolved to learn from Dazhai, catch up, and not fall behind on the socialist path, achieving new merits.

Once the cadres' thoughts were raised, a wave of learning from Dazhai quickly swept through the entire brigade. The whole brigade carried out large-scale mountainous construction, building a hundred-mu "Dazhai field." At this time, some people advocated that the production team's large carts should go out to earn extra money, increasing income. They said, "This is 'enriching the collective, and individuals also have money to spend.'" In response to this active thought, Xipu Brigade, with the help of the comrades from the People's Liberation Army, organized the masses in various types of study classes to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to thoroughly analyze this issue. Everyone followed the clues to believe that this was the poison of the Chinese Khrushchev's "fusion of public and private" theory. Comrade Wang Guozhan said to everyone: "In the past, we had three donkey legs, and today, thanks to Chairman Mao, we have mules and rubber-tired carts. Chairman Mao requires us to drive the collective's vehicles forward on the socialist path. The 'black wolf' Chinese Khrushchev, however, wants to lead us back, making us suffer twice. We will never fall for his tricks." After criticizing the thought of earning extra money, the community members' class consciousness was raised, and the twelve rubber-tired carts in the entire brigade concentrated their efforts to pull stones for the construction of the Dazhai field throughout the winter.

However, ideological struggle is bound to have setbacks. Before the arrival of the severe winter, some community members saw that the hundred-mu Dazhai field had not been leveled, and the ground was about to freeze, their thoughts changed again. They suggested borrowing a bulldozer from the county, working for ten days or so, saying, "Even if it costs some money, it would be satisfying." Some cadres also agreed with this approach. The brigade's leading group, together with the comrades from the People's Liberation Army, organized the cadres and community members in the study class to study Chairman Mao's teaching on "thrifty management of the commune" and discuss how to continue to carry forward the "poor and backward spirit" in the new situation. The result of the discussion was that everyone believed: "The problem is not what to use, but what to think. Using money to buy a bulldozer is fast and good, but it forgets Chairman Mao's teaching on thrifty management of the commune and discards the 'poor and backward spirit.'" They decided to use their hands to replace the bulldozer, saving more than 1,500 yuan on this alone. That winter, they pulled more than 3,000 cubic meters of stones from a high mountain twelve miles away, building fourteen dams, each three thousand seven hundred and fifty meters long and over one meter high.

    狠抓阶级教育办好毛泽东思想学习班
    ——西铺大队在解放军同志帮助下，毛泽东思想学习班越办越好
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席喻为“整个国家的形象”的“穷棒子社”——河北省遵化县建明人民公社西铺大队，在解放军某部毛泽东思想宣传队帮助下，开办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。通过大办学习班，广大贫下中农和革命干部进一步实现思想革命化，抓革命促生产的劲头越来越高。
    狠抓阶级教育，提高无产阶级觉悟
    毛主席教导我们：“阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”狠抓阶级教育，提高广大贫下中农和革命干部忠于伟大领袖毛主席的无产阶级觉悟，这是农村办好学习班的关键。西铺大队，贫下中农占百分之八十，家家户户都有一部苦难的血泪史。人们形容这里三十年前的生活是：“早吃菜，午吃糠，晚上稀粥照月亮。”“全家一条被，夜居破草房，三载换一装。”解放以后，在毛主席和共产党的领导下，西铺大队发生了翻天覆地的变化。王国藩同志和西铺大队的贫下中农，遵循毛主席的教导，坚决走合作化的道路，办起了二十三户贫农的“穷棒子”社。他们发扬“穷棒子精神”，迅速地改变了西铺大队的旧面貌。
    这个翻天覆地的变化，就是阶级教育最生动、最深刻的活教材。因此，西铺大队不论开办什么形式的学习班，都把阶级教育作为第一课。在干部当中，一度曾经出现过“怕”、“怨”、“难”的思想，有的人想撂挑子不干了。大队开办的干部学习班，针对这些活思想，组织干部进行回忆对比。大队长屈环原来觉得干部不好当，怕群众批评，怕家里埋怨，说什么也不愿干了。经过回忆对比，他几宿没有睡好觉，反复地琢磨毛主席教导的“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”这句话。他感到自己忘记了过去，忘记了阶级和阶级斗争，自己已经离毛主席的要求落后了一大截。他在学习班里说：“我身为贫农、党员，我们不干，让谁干？不愿为贫下中农掌权，就是最大的忘本；想撂挑子不干，就是对毛主席最大的不忠，实际是上了阶级敌人和中国赫鲁晓夫的当。”一忆、一比、一想，干部中“怕”、“怨”、“难”的情绪很快消除了，为贫下中农掌好权、用好权的自觉性提高了。他们挺起了腰杆，齐心协力挑起了革命和生产两副重担。
    在家庭学习班里，阶级教育也是很重要的一课。六十多岁的老贫农温化之，发现家里几个孩子不爱吃剩饭，两人盖一条被子嫌挤等现象。他和老伴就对孩子们说：“我们家，过去是房无一间，地无一垄，全家东西装不满个破筐，一年搬过七次家。有一年到了腊月二十八，还出去要饭。现在我们一年吃的白面要比解放前二十年吃的还多，爹亲娘亲那能比得上毛主席亲呀！”经过忆苦思甜，孩子们懂得了什么叫剥削，什么叫压迫，什么叫革命，他们更加热爱集体，热爱劳动，更加热爱伟大领袖毛主席。
        掀起群众性斗私批修的热潮
    毛主席教导我们：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。毛泽东思想学习班，始终坚持以“斗私，批修”为纲，引导大家自觉地破私立公，在改造世界观上狠下功夫。
    在大队举办的干部学习班里，王国藩同志带头亮私斗私，为革命干部和贫下中农树立了活样板。
    无产阶级文化大革命运动开始阶段，革命烈火烧到了王国藩同志身上。开始，他的思想斗争很激烈，有些想不通，家里人也埋怨说：“这都是当干部当的，不当干部既省心，又不得罪人。”一时，他心里感到委屈。学习了毛主席的最新指示后，他回忆起从抗日战争到全国解放后，自己和广大贫下中农紧跟毛主席走社会主义大道，办起了合作社，实现了公社化，这主要是靠毛主席的英明领导和广大革命群众的努力，绝不能把这些成绩记在个人的账本上。革命群众积极地给自己提意见，用革命烈火烧掉自己身上的一些缺点和错误，正是更高地要求自己替贫下中农掌好印把子。他在学习班里把自己的私心杂念抖落出来，狠斗狠批。他说：“我一定听毛主席的话，决不吃老本，要立新功！”
    王国藩同志亮私斗私的行动，带动了其他干部。在旧社会讨过八年饭的老贫农王荣，文化大革命初期看到阶级敌人要砍倒西铺这面红旗，就带领贫下中农冲锋陷阵，粉碎了阶级敌人的阴谋。以后，他被选为大队领导班子的主要负责人之一。当时，他感到大局已定，自己已是六十开外的人了，开会腿脚不灵便，管事多了又惹人，因此打算不干了。当他学习了毛主席“没有贫农，便没有革命”的教导后，反来复去地想，不干就是最大的忘本，就是对毛主席最大的不忠。他表示：活到老，干到老，一辈子忠于毛主席，一辈子跟着毛主席干革命！
    干部带群众，群众促干部，全西铺大队很快掀起了斗私批修高潮。社员韩玉珍一家老少三代，上到七十六岁的老人，下至十一岁的小娃娃，从去年十二月份办起家庭学习班以后，天天一起学习毛主席著作，一起斗私批修。以前，韩玉珍每次下地，总嘱咐孩子不要忘记往家捎秫秸。在学习班里，孩子们给她提了意见。她认识到，这不是一把柴禾的问题，这是把后代朝那条道路引的大问题。她主动地作了检查，同时也教育了全家。
    儿童们也成立了毛泽东思想红小兵学习班，他们以解放军为榜样，处处严格要求自己，每天清早起来扫大街，为五保户、烈属、军属挑水扫院，有时还自己组织开批判会。儿童们的变化，也教育了大人。他们说：“把孩子送到学习班接受毛泽东思想教育，我们很称心！”
      在社会主义道路上立新功
    毛主席教导我们要“抓住阶级斗争这个纲，抓住社会主义和资本主义两条道路斗争这个纲”。在学习班里要落实毛主席的最新指示，最根本的一条是要突出两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，就是要坚持社会主义方向。
    西铺大队在农业合作化运动一开始，二十三户贫农仅有三条驴腿；现在是骡马成群，胶轮车、水泵、拖拉机，样样都有。有的干部产生了“差不多”、“到顶了”的自满思想。干部学习班就专门解决部分干部思想上的骄傲自满问题。
    王国藩同志带领大家反复学习了毛主席对西铺大队办合作社的有关批示，回忆西铺大队十几年来的变化，同时也回忆了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在西铺推行的“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“工分挂帅”、“物质刺激”等黑货的流毒及危害。大家越想越觉得辜负了伟大领袖毛主席的期望，决心向大寨学习，迎头赶上，在社会主义道路上不掉队，立新功。
    干部的思想一提高，很快就在全大队掀起一个学习大寨的热潮。全大队大搞山地建设，修建百亩“大寨田”。这时，有一些人却主张生产队的大车到外面拉脚“赚外快”，增加收入。他们说，这是“肥了集体，个人也有钱花”。针对这一活思想，西铺大队在解放军同志帮助下，在各种类型的学习班里，组织群众以毛泽东思想为武器，对这个问题刨根问底。大家顺蔓摸瓜，认为这是中国赫鲁晓夫“公私溶化”论的流毒。王国藩同志对大家说：“过去咱们是三条驴腿，今天托毛主席的福，拴起了骡马胶轮车。毛主席他老人家要求我们赶着集体的车马在社会主义的道路上不断向前奔。中国赫鲁晓夫这个‘黑心狼’，却要把我们朝回头路上引，让我们重吃二遍苦，我们坚决不上他的当。”经过批判“赚外快”的思想，社员的阶级觉悟提高了，全大队十二辆胶轮车，集中全力为修建大寨田拉了一冬石头。
    但是，思想斗争是会有反复的。在严冬季节到来之前，有的社员看见百亩大寨田还没有平整，眼看大地就要封冻，思想上又转了向。他们建议从县里借台推土机，干它十几天，就是“花几个钱也痛快”。有的干部也同意了这种作法。大队领导班子又和解放军同志一起，组织干部、社员在学习班里学习毛主席“勤俭办社”的教导，讨论在新形势下如何继续发扬“穷棒子精神”的问题。讨论结果，大家认为：“问题不在用什么，而在于想什么，花钱用推土机是又快又好，可是忘记了毛主席关于勤俭办社的教导，丢掉了‘穷棒子精神’。”他们决心用双手代替推土机，仅这一项，就节约开支一千五百多元。这一冬，他们从往返十二里的高山上拉来了三千多方石头，垒起了十四道长达三千七百五十米，高一米多的坝墙。
