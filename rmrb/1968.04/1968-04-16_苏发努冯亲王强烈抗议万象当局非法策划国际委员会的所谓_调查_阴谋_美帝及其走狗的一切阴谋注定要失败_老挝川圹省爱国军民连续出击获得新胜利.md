Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front and Vice Premier of the Lao National United Government, recently sent a telegram to Prince Souvanna Phouma, strongly protesting the Vientiane regime's illegal plot to have the International Commission conduct a so-called "investigation of military conditions in southern Laos."

The telegram said that every action taken by the Vientiane regime and the Indian and Canadian representatives to the International Commission is illegal and ineffective.

The telegram pointed out: Facing increasing losses in Laos and a humiliating defeat in Vietnam, the U.S. imperialists are plotting to send troops to Laos to reverse the situation. They are currently using the Vientiane regime's slanderous propaganda against the Lao Patriotic Front and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to deceive public opinion and cover up their evil plots.

The telegram went on to say: Regrettably, Prince Souvanna Phouma's series of actions have only benefited the U.S. aggressors, while violating the legitimate interests of the Lao people and the cause of national independence and peace for the peoples of Indochina.

The telegram concluded by emphasizing that the Lao Patriotic Front has always believed that the internal affairs of Laos must be resolved by the Lao people themselves without U.S. interference. The evil plots, slander, and threats of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys against the Lao Patriotic Front will inevitably face stronger opposition and fierce counterattacks from the Lao people and are doomed to suffer a shameful failure.

	The patriotic military and people of Laos' Xieng Khouang Province have achieved new victories in recent continuous attacks.

	According to a report from the Pathet Lao News Agency, the patriotic armed forces of Xieng Khouang Province launched a fierce attack on April 9 against the bandits harbored by the Americans in the Seno area, killing more than 40 bandits, capturing three, and seizing a large amount of weapons and military equipment. After the bandits in the Seno area were eliminated, the people of Bakha, Phoun, Mounte, and Natiath also rose up to fight, supported by local armed forces and militia, and drove away the local armed bandits.

	Previously, on March 29, the military and people of Xieng Khouang Province also launched an attack on the enemy in the Ban Pone Sale area north of Moung Xai, annihilating 101 enemy troops.

	The patriotic military and people of Laos use weapons and equipment seized from the enemy to fight against the enemy. The picture shows Lao workers inspecting American-made weapons captured on the battlefield, preparing to send them to the front lines to annihilate the enemy.

    苏发努冯亲王强烈抗议万象当局非法策划国际委员会的所谓“调查”阴谋
    美帝及其走狗的一切阴谋注定要失败
    老挝川圹省爱国军民连续出击获得新胜利
    新华社康开十三日电据巴特寮通讯社报道：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会主席、老挝民族团结政府副首相苏发努冯亲王，最近打电报给富马，强烈抗议万象当局策划由国际委员会进行所谓“调查下寮军事情况”的非法行径。
    电报说，万象当局以及印度和加拿大驻国际委员会代表所采取的每一个行动都是非法和无效的。
    电报指出：美帝国主义者面对自己在老挝遭到的越来越大的损失和在越南遭受的可耻失败，正在策划亲自出兵老挝以挽回败局。他们目前正利用万象当局对老挝爱国战线党和越南民主共和国的诽谤宣传，妄图欺骗舆论，掩盖自己的罪恶阴谋。
    电报接着指出：令人遗憾的是，富马的一系列行动，只有利于美国侵略者，而违背了老挝人民的正当利益以及印度支那人民民族独立与和平的事业。
    电报最后强调说，老挝爱国战线党一贯认为，老挝的内部事务必须在没有美国干涉的情况下，由老挝人民自己来解决。美帝国主义者及其走狗对老挝爱国战线党的种种罪恶阴谋、诽谤和恐吓，必将遭到老挝人民越来越强烈的反对和猛烈的回击，而且注定要遭到可耻的失败。
    新华社康开十五日电老挝川圹省爱国军民，在最近的两次英勇战斗中，歼敌一百四十多名。
    据巴特寮通讯社报道，川圹省爱国武装力量，四月九日猛烈袭击盘踞在森左地区美国豢养的匪徒，打死顽匪四十多名，俘虏三名，缴获大批武器和军事装备。在森左地区的匪徒被消灭以后，巴卡、富侬、芒特和纳梯阿等地的人民在地方武装和民兵的支持下，也奋起斗争，赶走了当地的武装匪徒。
    在这以前，川圹省军民三月二十九日还曾在芒银以北的班奔卖地区袭击敌人，一举歼敌一百零一名。（附图片）
