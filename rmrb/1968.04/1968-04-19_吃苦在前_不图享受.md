The members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Sixth Motor Transport Depot of Qinghai Province's Transportation Bureau have carried forward the fine tradition of hard work and close ties with the masses, strictly demanding of themselves in all aspects. They have earned the support and admiration of the revolutionary workers.

According to Xinhua News Agency, the Revolutionary Committee of the Sixth Motor Transport Depot of Qinghai Province's Transportation Bureau, established in June last year, has, under the guidance of the People's Liberation Army's propaganda team for Mao Zedong Thought, been actively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. They have made the loyalty to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line their highest standard. They have established a steadfast routine of studying the works of Chairman Mao, whether at the depot or on the road, they persist in studying Chairman Mao's works.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We Communists are revolutionary, and we do not seek official posts. We must have a thorough spirit of revolution, and we must not for a moment separate ourselves from the masses. As long as we do not separate ourselves from the masses, we will certainly be victorious." As soon as the Revolutionary Committee was established, all members repeatedly studied this great teaching of Chairman Mao and immediately put it into practice. Through discussions, they decided that usually only one member would stay in the office to handle daily affairs, while the rest of the leadership would go to the workshops and teams to work and study with the workers. They volunteered to take on the most arduous tasks, going to the most difficult and laborious places. Last winter, the team received a task to transport grain to the Tibetan people in the Tibet Autonomous Prefecture of Yushu. This trip required crossing the snow-covered Bayan Kala Mountains at an altitude of over 5,000 meters, making the journey extremely difficult. Five committee members took turns leading the team. Along the way, they led the revolutionary workers in reciting Chairman Mao's great teachings: "With firm determination, fearing no sacrifice, and overcoming all difficulties, we shall win victory." They dug through several feet of ice and snow, driving day and night. Sometimes, as soon as the front car passed, the following car would be blocked by sudden snowstorms. The committee members would rush back and forth, working with the revolutionary workers to clear the snow, their hands, feet, and faces frozen, but they still led the fight. Sometimes they were so busy that they couldn't eat for a day and a night, but their spirits were higher than ever, continuously singing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, inspiring comrades to press forward bravely. Deputy Director Zhang Liancheng, a revolutionary cadre who participated in the "three-in-one combination," did whatever was needed, whether driving, assisting, or other work. Director Jia Youcun often crawled into the deep snow under the car, enduring temperatures of minus thirty degrees Celsius to repair the car, but always remembered to let others go to a sheltered place to warm up. The committee members acted both as soldiers and commanders, solving problems as they arose during production and labor. The revolutionary workers in the team said emotionally: "Cadres use Mao Zedong Thought to guide their actions, use Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, and in revolutionary struggles and work, they always set a model and take the lead. No matter how difficult it is, we are not afraid, and we can overcome any difficulty!"

The members of the Sixth Motor Transport Depot's Revolutionary Committee care for the masses in political and ideological matters, and in daily life, they also care for the masses, helping revolutionary workers and their families solve specific difficulties. However, they always follow Chairman Mao's teaching: "Let others enjoy, pick the heavy burdens, suffer first, and enjoy last," strictly demanding of themselves. They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great teaching: "Winning nationwide victory is only the first step in the long march of ten thousand li. ... China's revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is even longer, the work is even greater, and even more arduous. This must be made clear to the Party now, and comrades must continue to maintain a humble, prudent, modest, and unassuming style, and comrades must continue to maintain the style of hard work and self-reliance." And they seriously put it into practice. In the past period, due to a shortage of housing, the depot built some family dormitories. The workers, out of concern for the leadership, proposed to give priority to the committee members. The committee members insisted on giving priority to the worker comrades. In the end, none of the eight committee members moved into the new houses. When watching movies or plays, the committee members also gave priority to the worker comrades.

    吃苦在前　不图享受
    青海省运输局第六汽车场革委会成员发扬艰苦奋斗、密切联系群众的优良作风，处处严格要求自己，得到广大革命职工的拥护和支持
    据新华社西宁十八日电　青海省运输局第六汽车场革命委员会的成员，牢记伟大领袖毛主席的教导，发扬我党艰苦奋斗、密切联系群众的光荣传统，处处严格要求自己，在工作上吃苦在先，在待遇上不图享受。全场革命职工紧密地团结在革命委员会的周围，抓革命促生产，做出了很大成绩。
    这个车场的革委会去年六月成立后，全体成员就在解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，活学活用毛泽东思想，狠抓自己的思想革命化，把忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线作为对自己的最高要求。他们和革命职工一起建立了学习毛主席著作的雷打不动的制度，无论在车场里，或者在领队行车时，都坚持学习毛主席著作。
    毛主席教导我们说：“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命，我们人人要有彻底的革命精神，我们不要有一时一刻脱离群众。只要我们不脱离群众，我们就一定会胜利。”这个汽车场革委会一成立，全体成员就反复学习了毛主席的这一伟大教导，并且立即落实到行动上。他们通过讨论，决定平时只留一名委员在办公室值班，处理日常事务，其余的领导成员都到车间和车队去，和职工们一起闹革命，一起学习和劳动。凡是艰苦繁重的任务，委员们都抢先担负，越苦越累的地方他们越要去。去年冬天，车队接到给玉树藏族自治州的藏族同胞运送粮食的任务。这次出车要越过拔海五千米的大雪封闭的巴颜喀拉山，行车十分艰苦。革委会有五个委员先后担任了车队的领队。行车中，他们带领革命职工一边朗读毛主席的伟大教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，一边挖开几尺厚的冰雪，日夜兼程前进。有时前面的车子刚过，后面的车子又被突然袭来的风雪阻挡，革委会的委员们就往返奔波，和革命职工们一道不停地挖雪开路，手、脚、脸都冻肿了，仍然带头坚持战斗。有时他们忙得一天一夜吃不上饭，但斗志越来越高，不断高唱毛主席语录歌，鼓舞同志们奋勇前进。革委会副主任张连城是参加“三结合”的革命领导干部，不管是当司机、当助手或做其他工作，需要他干什么他就干什么。革委会主任贾有存，不时钻进车底的深雪里，冒着摄氏零下三十度的严寒修车，却时时不忘让别的同志到避风处取暖。革委会的委员们既当战士又当指挥员，在带头生产劳动中随时解决工作中出现的问题。同车队的革命职工感动地说：“干部用毛泽东思想统帅自己的行动，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，在革命斗争和工作中处处起模范带头作用，再艰苦我们也不怕，天大的困难也能克服！”
    第六汽车场革委会的成员在政治思想上关心群众，在生活上也处处关心群众，帮助革命职工及其家属解决具体困难，而对自己则时时遵循毛主席关于“享受让给人家，担子拣重的挑，吃苦在别人前头，享受在别人后头”的教导，严格要求自己。他们反复学习了毛主席的伟大教导：“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步。……中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。这一点现在就必须向党内讲明白，务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。”并且认真落实到行动上。前一时期因住房不够，场里盖了些家属宿舍，职工们从关心领导出发，提出要优先分配给革委会的委员们，革委会的同志坚持优先照顾工人同志们，最后八个委员没有一个住进新房。平时看电影、看戏，革委会的委员们也是优先把票分给工人同志们。
