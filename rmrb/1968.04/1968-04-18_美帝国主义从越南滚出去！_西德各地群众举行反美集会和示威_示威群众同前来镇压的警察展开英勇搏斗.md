Masses in West Germany hold anti-U.S. rallies and demonstrations

Demonstrators bravely fight back against police attempting to suppress them

New China News Agency, Bonn, April 15 — In recent days, people from all over West Germany have been holding demonstrations and marches to protest against the U.S. imperialist war of aggression in Vietnam.

On the 15th, more than 8,000 residents of Hamburg held a demonstration and march, and surrounded one of the U.S. aggression institutions, the "American House." In Frankfurt, more than 7,000 residents from Hesse state shouted angrily through loudspeakers, "Yankees, get out of Vietnam!" In Hanover, more than 700 demonstrators marched in front of the U.S. Consulate General, waving the flags of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and repeatedly shouting the name of the great leader of the Vietnamese people, Chairman Ho Chi Minh.

Earlier, on the 14th, 500 demonstrators in Kiel carried a black coffin in a procession to symbolize the funeral of the "peace talks" conspiracy of the U.S. imperialist head Johnson, signifying the failure of the U.S. imperialist "bombing to talk" fraud. On the 13th, residents of Cologne held a march in the city, with many people holding up placards with slogans such as "Fight against U.S. imperialism!" and "Yankees, get out of Vietnam!"

In addition, in many cities in West Germany such as Bochum, Bremen, Stuttgart, Freiburg, Brunswick, and Offenbach, the masses also held meetings and demonstrations. The placards carried by the demonstrators read: "Yankees, get out!" and other slogans.

Facing the tide of public protest, the West German reactionary authorities were very panicked. They sent out large numbers of police, using water cannons, horses, batons, and police dogs to brutally suppress the demonstrators.

Many demonstrators were injured, and some were arrested. However, the demonstrators were not afraid of violence and bravely fought back against the police. In Nuremberg, some young people, when arrested by the police, angrily denounced the police as "Nazi pigs" and "Gestapo" (Hitler's secret police).

    美帝国主义从越南滚出去！
    西德各地群众举行反美集会和示威
    示威群众同前来镇压的警察展开英勇搏斗
    新华社波恩十五日电  西德全国各地群众，连日来纷纷举行示威游行，抗议美帝国主义侵略越南的战争。
    十五日，汉堡的八千多名居民举行示威游行，并且包围了美国侵略机构之一“美国之家”。在法兰克福，来自黑森州的七千多居民在举行示威游行时，用扩音器愤怒地高呼“美国佬从越南滚出去！”汉诺威的七百多名示威者在美国总领事馆前举行示威游行，他们打着越南南方民族解放阵线的旗帜，并不断高呼越南人民的伟大领袖胡志明主席的名字。
    在这以前，基尔的五百名示威者十四日曾抬着一个为美帝头子约翰逊“和谈”阴谋送葬的黑棺材举行游行，象征美帝国主义“停炸诱和”骗局的破产。科隆的居民于十三日在市内举行游行，不少人高举着写有“向美帝国主义进行斗争！”“美国佬从越南滚出去！”等口号的标语牌。
    此外，在西德的波鸿、不来梅、斯图加特、弗赖堡、不伦瑞克、奥芬巴赫等许多城市的群众，也都纷纷举行集会和示威游行，示威者举着的标语牌上写着：“美国佬滚出去！”等口号。
    面对群众的抗议怒潮，西德反动当局十分惊慌，他们派出大批警察，用水龙、马队、警棍、警犬对示威群众进行野蛮镇压。
    许多示威者被打伤，有些被逮捕。但是示威群众不畏强暴，同警察展开了英勇的搏斗。在纽伦堡，一些青年在遭到警察的逮捕时，愤怒地斥责警察是“纳粹猪”、“盖世太保（即希特勒的秘密警察）”。
