Mao Zedong taught us: "The Party committee must rely on the 'one group of people' to fulfill its leadership tasks and give full play to their roles. 'If this 'one group of people' do not act in unison, they cannot lead thousands and tens of thousands of people into battle or into construction.'"

The Revolutionary Committee must lead the masses in revolution and production. It must, under the guidance of Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line, unite the three forces—representatives of revolutionary cadres, military representatives, and representatives of revolutionary masses—into one cohesive unit. This will make it a truly vigorous and strong fighting collective.

Since the "three-in-one combination" leadership team is composed of representatives from three sides, it must handle the relationships among them properly. It should adhere to the principles of Mao Zedong Thought and proletarian party spirit, respect each other, learn from each other, and improve together, and guard against tendencies of factionalism and sectarianism. Only in this way can the newly formed Revolutionary Committee maintain unity and consistency, which is beneficial for leading the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses to fight against the class enemy and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The members of the Revolutionary Committee come from different positions, and their ideological level and experience in struggle are not the same. It is not surprising that they have different opinions on some issues. The key is to start from the desire for unity and carry out criticism and self-criticism. When there are problems, hold meetings to discuss them on the table. We must not only be good at uniting with comrades who have the same opinions as us but also be good at uniting with comrades who have different opinions to work together.

The "three-in-one combination" Revolutionary Committee is a creation of the proletariat and the people in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Pinggu County Revolutionary Committee fully plays the role of the three representatives, maintaining close ties with the masses, and always fighting together with the masses. Their experience is worth learning from.

    三股力量拧成一股绳
    本报评论员
    毛主席教导我们：“党委要完成自己的领导任务，就必须依靠党委这‘一班人’，充分发挥他们的作用。”“如果这‘一班人’动作不整齐，就休想带领千百万人去作战，去建设。”
    革命委员会要领导广大群众进行革命和生产，就必须在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，把革命干部代表、军队代表、革命群众代表这三股力量拧成一股绳，使它真正成为一个朝气蓬勃的坚强的战斗集体。
    “三结合”的领导班子，既然是由三个方面的代表组成的，就必须处理好相互之间的关系。应该按照毛泽东思想的原则，无产阶级党性的原则，彼此尊重，互相学习，共同提高，防止山头主义和宗派主义的倾向。这样，才能使新生的革命委员会队伍整齐，步调一致，有利于带领无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众同阶级敌人进行战斗，去夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    革命委员会的成员，来自不同的岗位，思想水平和斗争经历也不一样，在一些问题上有不同的意见，是不奇怪的。重要的是，要从团结的愿望出发，开展批评和自我批评。有了问题就开会，摆到桌面上来讨论。我们不仅要善于团结和自己意见相同的同志，而且要善于团结和自己意见不同的同志一道工作。
      “三结合”的革命委员会，是工人阶级和人民群众在这次文化大革命中的一种创造。平谷县革命委员会，充分发挥三方面代表的作用，使自己保持和群众的密切联系，始终和群众团结战斗在一起。他们的经验，是值得学习的。
