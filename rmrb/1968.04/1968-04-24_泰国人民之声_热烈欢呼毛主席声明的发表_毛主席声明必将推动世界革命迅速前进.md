"The Voice of the Thai People" radio station issued a commentary on April 22 stating that Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence not only points the way forward for the revolutionary struggle of the American people, including blacks, but also for the revolutionary struggle of all peoples of the world.

The commentary said, Chairman Mao Zedong's statement is a call to arms for the revolutionary peoples of the world to launch a fierce offensive against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys. It will surely accelerate the progress of the world revolution.

The commentary said, under the correct and wise leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, the revolutionary struggle of the Thai people is developing rapidly and widely, striking heavy blows at the reactionary rule of U.S. imperialism and the Thanom group. The Thai people actively respond to the call of the Communist Party of Thailand, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and resolutely carrying the armed struggle to the end.

The commentary condemned U.S. imperialism, the Thanom-Baibo group, and the revisionist traitors for using various means to deceive the people into abandoning armed struggle in favor of parliamentary struggle. The commentary pointed out that under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, the revolutionary people of Thailand are determined to persist in people's war. The Thai people deeply understand that only by daring to use revolutionary violence to resolutely resist counter-revolutionary violence can they achieve true revolutionary victory. The commentary expressed that the Thai people will respond with practical actions to Chairman Mao's call, support the struggle of American blacks, and launch a sustained and fierce offensive against U.S. imperialism and the Thanom traitor group.

The commentary said, the Thai people believe that the struggle of American blacks against violence strongly supports the revolutionary struggle of the Thai people. The Thai people regard their revolutionary struggle as a part of the world revolution. We will actively support the world revolution.

The commentary finally emphasized that the world situation will definitely develop according to Chairman Mao's scientific judgment: "The thorough collapse of colonialism, imperialism, and all systems of exploitation, and the thorough liberation of all oppressed peoples and oppressed nations, is not far off."
