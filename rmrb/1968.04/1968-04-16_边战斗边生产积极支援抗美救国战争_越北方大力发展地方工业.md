Vietnamese workers in the light industry sector in North Vietnam are fighting while producing, overcoming various difficulties, and vigorously developing local industries to strongly support the Anti-American National Salvation War.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi, in 1967, various provinces and cities in North Vietnam completed and put into production 250 consumer goods production units. That year, the production of consumer goods in local industries across the regions increased compared to 1966. Provinces such as Quang Binh, Nghe An, Quang Tri, and Thua Thien, which are in intense combat environments, still saw an increase in the production of light industrial products ranging from 7% to 55% compared to 1966. Many products, such as knitted goods, soap, cloth, plastic products, and other daily necessities, saw an increase in production of more than 4% compared to 1966.

Last year, the light industry sector focused on developing the production of necessary items such as paper, ceramic products, and glassware to meet the needs of people's lives and production. Provinces and cities like Hung Yen and Hai Phong built dozens of new paper mills, which have already started production. More than ten other paper mills are under construction. Local areas used makeshift and locally available materials to solve the problem of paper raw material supply, reducing the burden on the state.

Local tobacco industry production departments produced 21 million packs of cigarettes in 1967. The textile sector produced hundreds of thousands of meters of mosquito net fabric in 1967, an increase compared to 1966.

    越北方大力发展地方工业
    据新华社河内电　越南北方轻工业部门广大职工边战斗边生产，克服种种困难，大力发展地方工业，有力地支援了抗美救国战争。
    越南北方各省、市在一九六七年建成了二百五十个消费品生产单位并投入了生产。这一年，各地地方工业的消费品产量比一九六六年都有所增长。广平、义安、河静、清化等省处于激烈的战斗环境中，但轻工业产品的产量仍比一九六六年增加百分之七到百分之五十五。许多产品如针织品、肥皂、布匹、塑料制品及其它日用品的产量比一九六六年增加百分之四以上。
    去年，轻工业部门集中力量发展纸张、陶瓷器、玻璃制品等必需品的生产，以满足人民生活和生产的需要。兴安、海防等省市新建了成十座造纸厂，并已投入生产，其他十多座造纸厂正在积极兴建。各地采用因陋就简、就地取材的办法，解决造纸原料供应问题，减轻了国家的负担。
    各地地方烟草工业生产部门，在一九六七年生产了二千一百万包卷烟。纺织部门在一九六七年生产的蚊帐布比六六年增加成百万米。
