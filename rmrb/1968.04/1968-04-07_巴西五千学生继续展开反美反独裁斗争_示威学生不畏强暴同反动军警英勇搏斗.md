	Rio de Janeiro, April 6 (New China News Agency) — Five thousand students in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, continued their anti-American, anti-dictatorship struggle. On April 4, they broke through the tight blockade set up by reactionary military police and took to the streets to hold a demonstration.

	The reactionary authorities in Brazil are terrified of the students' patriotic and just actions. They brazenly dispatched helicopters, tanks, and military vehicles, and sent out large numbers of cavalrymen brandishing sabers in an attempt to suppress the demonstrating students. The students, undaunted by the violence, bravely fought back against the reactionary armed police. They destroyed two military vehicles and injured several reactionary military police. The U.S. news office in Rio de Janeiro was also attacked by the angry students.
