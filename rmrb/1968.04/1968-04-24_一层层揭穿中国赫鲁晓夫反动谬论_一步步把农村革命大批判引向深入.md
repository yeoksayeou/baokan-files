With the help of the PLA comrades, the approach in Huade County is to determine specific topics for criticism, closely link them with local realities, and concentrate forces to launch annihilation battles.

XINHUA NEWS AGENCY — The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army has assisted the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Huade County, Jilin Province, in using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon. By linking the two-line struggle history of the region and the production brigade, they have conducted a topic-by-topic criticism of the reactionary fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev, making the revolutionary criticism very effective.

After arriving in Huade County, the propaganda team actively assisted the poor and lower-middle peasants in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and launched a revolutionary criticism. Initially, they exposed many reactionary fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev, such as the "extinction of class struggle," "four freedoms," "three autonomies and one contract," and mixed them all together for criticism. As a result, they fired a few shots here and there, held several criticism meetings, and the community members felt that they could not delve deeper. What should they do? The comrades of the propaganda team repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on annihilation battles and believed that for the reactionary fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev, they must concentrate their firepower to launch annihilation battles on each one, in order to criticize deeply and thoroughly, and to criticize and expose them completely. Therefore, the comrades of the propaganda team, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, studied and divided the reactionary fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev spread in the countryside into specific topics for criticism one by one.

For example, the first topic of criticism was the reactionary fallacy of "three autonomies and one contract" advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev. The comrades of the propaganda team guided the community members to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, linking the history of the two-line struggle in the local area, layer by layer to expose the fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev.

What class does the Chinese Khrushchev advocate "three autonomies and one contract" for? What class does it serve? The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants first addressed this question, studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "the broad masses of peasants are willing to follow the Party's leadership and gradually take the socialist road," and recalled the bitterness of being exploited and oppressed in the old society and the bitterness of individual farming. Zhang Zhiqu, an old poor peasant from the Jinquan Commune's Struggle Brigade, angrily said: "In the old society, my family has been begging for generations, from the passes to the outside, barely enduring until liberation, and we got land and houses. But the days of individual farming did not last a few years, because my family had many mouths to feed and few laborers, life forced me to sell the land again. If it were not for Chairman Mao leading us to take the collective path, the poor and lower-middle peasants organizing to establish cooperatives, I would have to go back to working for the landlords. In 1962, the Chinese Khrushchev threw out the 'three autonomies and one contract' black goods, and some landlord and rich peasant elements arrogantly shouted 'land returns to its original owner.' For which class does 'three autonomies and one contract' speak? For which class does it serve? Isn't it clear?"

Next, everyone further exposed the Chinese Khrushchev's claim that "three autonomies and one contract" can mobilize the peasants' production enthusiasm and increase production. Many production teams of poor and lower-middle peasants studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "political work is the lifeline of all economic work," linking the situation in their team where political work was not emphasized, leading to work points being the main focus and material incentives, causing some community members to work only for quantity and not quality. The community members said, the Chinese Khrushchev said that "three autonomies and one contract" can mobilize the peasants' production enthusiasm and increase production, which is completely deceiving. "Three autonomies and one contract" mobilizes the enthusiasm for personal wealth accumulation, increases selfishness, and will lead to the restoration of capitalism.

The Chinese Khrushchev, feeling guilty, after throwing out the "three autonomies and one contract" black goods, defended himself by saying: "three autonomies and one contract" is a method issue, not a direction issue. The comrades of the propaganda team organized the poor and lower-middle peasants to recall the history of the two-line struggle in their commune and brigade, and recognized the Chinese Khrushchev's evil plot to use the "three autonomies and one contract" method to restore capitalism in the countryside during the country's temporary difficulties. Wang Gui, an old poor peasant from the Junmin Brigade of the Jinquan Commune, said: "The Chinese Khrushchev has always tried to restore capitalism in the countryside. After the land reform, he frantically 'protected the rich peasant economy,' forming a serious polarization between the rich and the poor. At that time, there were twenty households buying and selling land here, and four households of poor peasants had to carry the burden again. The landlord and rich peasant elements were extremely arrogant, plotting to incite a counterattack. Later, we responded to Chairman Mao's great call, voluntarily organized to establish cooperatives. The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents slandered this revolutionary action as 'rushing ahead,' and stubbornly refused to approve it. At that time, we did not believe in that evil, we only listened to Chairman Mao's words, and even if it was not approved, we still established the commune. Because we insisted on taking the socialist road, our commune not only succeeded but also did well."

Through such step-by-step in-depth topic criticism, the reactionary nature of the fallacies advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev, such as "three autonomies and one contract," was thoroughly exposed, making the Chinese Khrushchev reveal his old reactionary face, and arousing the poor and lower-middle peasants' deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants love Chairman Mao, socialism, and the collective economy even more.

    一层层揭穿中国赫鲁晓夫反动谬论
    一步步把农村革命大批判引向深入  
    在解放军同志帮助下，怀德县的作法是：确定一个个的批判专题，密切联系当地实际，集中力量打歼灭战
    本报讯　人民解放军某部毛泽东思想宣传队，帮助吉林省怀德县广大贫下中农，以毛泽东思想为武器，联系本地区本社队两条道路斗争的历史，对中国赫鲁晓夫的反动谬论一个一个地进行专题批判，使革命大批判搞得很有成效。
    这个宣传队到怀德县农村以后，就积极帮助贫下中农活学活用毛主席著作，开展革命的大批判。开始的时候，他们把中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，“四大自由”、“三自一包”等许多反动谬论都揭发出来，混在一起批判。结果东放一枪，西放一炮，开了几次批判会，社员们就觉得深入不下去了。怎么办呢？宣传队的同志反复学习了毛主席的关于打歼灭战的教导，认为对于中国赫鲁晓夫的反动谬论，必须一个一个地集中火力打歼灭战，才能批深批透，批倒批臭。于是，宣传队的同志就和贫下中农一起研究，把中国赫鲁晓夫散布在农村的反革命修正主义谬论，分成专题，逐个进行批判。
    例如，第一个批判专题，是中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“三自一包”的反动谬论。宣传队的同志引导社员用毛泽东思想为武器，联系当地两条道路斗争的历史，一层一层地揭穿中国赫鲁晓夫的谬论。
    中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“三自一包”究竟是为哪个阶级说话，为哪个阶级服务的？广大贫下中农首先针对这个问题，学习了毛主席关于“广大农民是愿意在党的领导下逐步地走上社会主义道路的”教导，回忆了旧社会受剥削、受压迫的苦和单干的苦。宝泉公社奋进大队老贫农张治岐气愤地说：“在旧社会，我家祖祖辈辈讨饭，从关里讨到关外，好容易熬到了解放，分了土地和房屋。可是单干的日子没过几年，由于我家人口多，劳力少，生活逼得我又卖了土地。要不是毛主席引导我们走集体化的道路，贫下中农组织起来办了合作社，我又得去给地主扛活。一九六二年中国赫鲁晓夫抛出了
  ‘三自一包’的黑货，一些地主、富农分子就狂妄地叫嚷‘土地回老家’。‘三自一包’是为哪个阶级说话，为哪个阶级服务，不是明摆着的吗？”
    接着，大家又揭穿了中国赫鲁晓夫所说的“三自一包”“可以调动农民生产积极性，可以增产”的鬼话。许多生产队的贫下中农学习了毛主席关于“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导，联系本队过去不突出无产阶级政治，搞工分挂帅、物质刺激，使有些社员干活只求数量不求质量的情况，进一步看清了“三自一包”所造成的恶果。社员们说，中国赫鲁晓夫说“三自一包”可以调动农民生产积极性，可以增产，完全是骗人的鬼话。“三自一包”调动的是个人发家致富的积极性，增加的是私心，产生的将是资本主义复辟。
    中国赫鲁晓夫做贼心虚，抛出“三自一包”黑货以后，又自己辩解说：“三自一包”是方法问题，不是方向问题。宣传队的同志组织贫下中农回忆了本社队两条道路斗争的历史，认清了中国赫鲁晓夫趁国家暂时困难之际，妄图用“三自一包”这个“方法”在农村实行资本主义复辟的罪恶阴谋。宝泉公社军民大队老贫农汪贵说：“中国赫鲁晓夫一直妄图在农村复辟资本主义。土改后，他疯狂地‘保护富农经济’，形成了严重的贫富两极分化。我们这里当时就有二十户买卖土地，有四户贫农又重新扛活。地主、富农分子极为嚣张，阴谋煽动反攻倒算。后来，我们响应毛主席的伟大号召，自动组织起来成立了合作社，中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人又诬蔑我们这一革命行动是‘冒进’，死死卡住不批准。当时我们没信那个邪，我们只听毛主席的话，不批准也办社。由于我们坚持走社会主义道路，我们的社不但办成了，而且办得好。”
    通过这样步步深入的专题大批判，把中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“三自一包”等谬论的反动本质，彻底揭穿揭透，使中国赫鲁晓夫露出了老反革命的原形，激起了贫下中农对中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派的无比仇恨。广大贫下中农更加热爱毛主席，热爱社会主义，热爱集体经济。
