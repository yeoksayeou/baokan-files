From the famous mountain city of Massanta in southern Guinea, a short drive of about ten minutes along the road to the airport, a vast expanse of lush green tea fields comes into view. This is the renowned Massanta Tea Plantation in Guinea. At the center of the plantation stands a series of neatly arranged light green factory buildings, which is Guinea's first large-scale mechanized tea factory with its own raw material base – the Massanta Tea Factory.

This tea plantation and factory were built with China's assistance and were officially completed on February 22 of this year. The plantation began clearing land and sowing in August 1963, and the planting area has been continuously expanding. The factory started construction in January 1966 and was completed and put into trial production in March 1967.

This tea plantation and factory, which the Guinean people praise as the "Pearl of Massanta," currently produce red and green tea that not only meet the needs of the broad Guinean people but also have a small amount for export. Whenever Guinean friends talk about the Massanta Tea Plantation and factory, they always say: "Drinking tea, we think of those who planted it. We should wholeheartedly thank the great leader Chairman Mao for sending such excellent Chinese technicians to help us."

	The Wilderness Turned into Tea Fields

When the Chinese tea cultivation technicians arrived in the Darelala area of Massanta to develop the tea plantation, it was a wilderness overgrown with wild grass and杂树. Additionally, Guinea's climate has only two seasons, dry and rainy. During the six-month rainy season, it often rains heavily day and night; during the dry season, it is often clear skies with the sun blazing overhead, and the ground temperature can sometimes reach over 40 degrees Celsius. These climatic conditions also brought many difficulties to the task of clearing land and planting tea.

The Chinese technicians, remembering Chairman Mao's teachings of "Resolutely deciding, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory," worked closely with Guinean workers, putting in tremendous effort. They cleared large tracts of dormant wilderness day after day, rain or shine, working from dawn till dusk. Together with Guinean workers, they planted trees and applied fertilizer. After three years and ten months of day and night struggle, they completed the large-scale tea tree planting task two months ahead of schedule, turning the Darelala wilderness into a vast sea of tea.

The Massanta Tea Plantation is indeed another blossom of friendship between the peoples of China and Guinea, nurtured with their blood and sweat.

	Selfless and Dedicated

It took nearly four years to develop the Massanta large-scale tea plantation, and it took one year and two months of intense labor to build this mechanized tea factory. After arriving in Guinea, the Chinese construction technicians, taking Comrade Norman Bethune as their example, who was selfless and dedicated to the people, immediately rolled up their sleeves and started working. At the beginning of the work, there were no means of transportation, so they would get up early every day, carry their own food, and walk ten kilometers to the construction site; at night, they would walk back to their accommodations under the stars. The former district chief of Massanta, Bary Ibrahim, said: "The Chinese engineering technicians have done a lot for us in Guinea, but they have very few demands in their lives."

During the construction of the tea factory, the Chinese technicians followed Chairman Mao's teachings of thrift in all undertakings, always thinking of the Guinean people and saving every penny. For the construction of buildings, a large amount of sand and stones were needed, so the Chinese technicians went up the mountain to mine them without spending a penny. To save on loading and unloading fees, they directly unloaded the goods from the trucks that came from Conakry. Most of the materials and machinery used for the construction were also unloaded by them during their rest time. They also used their spare time to collect old nails, small wooden boards, and corrugated iron sheets to build some auxiliary workshops, material warehouses, and fertilizer and pesticide warehouses. They also built two bathrooms for the Guinean workers who worked there. This not only met the production needs of the tea factory and plantation but also saved Guinea a lot of expenses.

When Guinean workers talked about these things, they would always give a thumbs up and praise them, saying: "The technicians sent by Chairman Mao do not consider themselves at all and always think of us Guineans. They are very respected people."

In October 1966, heavy rain destroyed the road and several wooden bridges between Massanta and Boufousou. At this time, the Chinese technicians repeatedly studied the teachings of the great teacher Chairman Mao on serving the people wholeheartedly and selflessly, and organized a road repair team. They went to repair the road three kilometers away eight times. There were no wooden materials, so they went into the forest to cut them; there were no stones, so they went up the mountain to quarry them.

When the destroyed road was about to be repaired, suddenly dark clouds gathered, thunder roared, and torrential rain poured down. They were soaked to the skin, but they sang the song of Chairman Mao's quotations: "Resolutely deciding, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." They continued to work. A Guinean friend on the scene was moved and said: "We have never seen such good technicians like the Chinese. They are truly the ones taught by Chairman Mao." Many passing Guinean people witnessed this moving scene, were deeply moved, and also joined in the road repair.

A Guinean friend said: "The Chinese technicians not only built the tea factory for us but also repaired the bridges and roads for us. As long as it is beneficial to the Guinean people, they will do it. The spirit of the Chinese technicians to wholeheartedly work for us, we will never forget."

	Deep Friendship Between Chinese and Guinean People

The Chinese technicians resolutely implemented the eight principles of China's foreign aid, selflessly imparting technology to Guinean workers, and striving to cultivate a complete team of tea cultivation and processing technicians for Guinea. They organized the workers and systematically taught them technical and theoretical knowledge. The Chinese technicians did not speak the local language, so they repeatedly demonstrated and patiently taught the Guinean workers the operating methods. They also actively learned the local language to better impart technology to the Guinean workers.

After several years of patient help from the Chinese technicians and diligent learning by the Guinean workers, the first generation of Guinean tea industry technicians has grown up, mastering various professional technologies of tea cultivation and processing. Now, the various workshops and departments of the tea factory are basically managed by Guinean staff, and the work is well-organized and excellent. Old worker Ibrahim said excitedly: "I worked with the French for decades, but I learned nothing except being beaten and scolded. But with the Chinese technicians, although the time was not long, I learned almost the entire set of tea cultivation techniques, including planting, pruning, fertilizing, and planning rows. This proves that the Chinese technicians are our real brothers, and China's aid is sincere and selfless."

During the years of joint work, the Chinese technicians and Guinean workers established a deep friendship. This friendship, like the young tea trees, grew rapidly and vigorously.

Chinese technician Wang Desui was assigned to train the young apprentice Su Amadu after arriving in Massanta. Amadu had a boil on his body, affecting his work. Wang Desui, with class feelings, carefully washed the boil with salt water for him every day after work and then applied medicine. After half a month, Amadu's boil was cured.

There are many other touching examples of Chinese technicians caring for the hardships of Guinean workers and helping others.

One day, Chinese tea tree cultivation technician Dai Zhida found that Guinean worker Niu Kai had not come to work, so he went to visit him during his rest time. Dai Zhida found that Niu Kai had acute gastroenteritis, vomiting and diarrhea, and his condition was critical. Dai Zhida immediately found a car and sent Niu Kai to his residence, quickly called a Chinese doctor to treat him, and saved Niu Kai.

Once, Dai Zhida fell ill. During his illness, many Guinean workers came to visit him every day, asking about his health and caring for him.

When Chinese friends saw that the clothes of Guinean male workers were torn, they took out their own sewing kits and mended them one stitch at a time. When Guinean female tea pickers went to pick tea in the morning, their clothes were soaked by the dew. The Chinese technicians found this out and brought out plastic bags used for fertilizer, sewed them into raincoats, and gave them to the women. The deep class feelings of the Chinese comrades often moved the Guinean workers to tears. Blacksmith Alaya Bulu, to commemorate this sublime friendship, specially used the surname of the Chinese comrades as the name of his child.

Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live!

Through the words and deeds of the Chinese technicians, the Guinean workers and local residents of the Massanta Tea Plantation and factory saw the noble qualities of the Chinese working class nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, and the invincible power of Mao Zedong Thought. They loved Chairman Mao, the red sun in the hearts of the people of the world, even more, and revered the great Mao Zedong Thought even more.

Many Guinean workers regard obtaining Chairman Mao's portrait, "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and Chairman Mao's badges as the greatest happiness. They framed Chairman Mao's portrait and hung it in the most prominent place in their homes; they wore Chairman Mao's badges on their chests and embedded them in their hats. Some workers not only studied Chairman Mao's works diligently but also used Sundays and holidays to read "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to their relatives and neighbors.

A Guinean friend named Kamala Sangiana said: "In our Guinea, there is no one who does not know China, and there is no one who does not know the great leader Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is the eternal red sun in the hearts of revolutionary people all over the world. We love and respect the great teacher Chairman Mao infinitely."

Recently, when reporters visited the Massanta Tea Factory, some young Guinean workers surrounded the reporters, asking for the most precious gift – Chairman Mao's badges. They eagerly said: "I love Chairman Mao the most!" When these young men received Chairman Mao's badges, they jumped for joy and shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live! Long live Chairman Mao forever! Forever!"

    毛主席派来的技术人员就是好
    ——记我国帮助几内亚建设马桑塔茶园
    从几内亚南部著名的山城马桑塔乘汽车出发，沿着通向飞机场的公路行驶大约十几分钟，眼前便展现出一片一望无际的绿油油的茶林，这就是几内亚有名的马桑塔茶园。茶园中心，有一幢幢排列得整整齐齐的浅绿色的厂房，这就是几内亚第一个拥有自己的原料基地的大型机械化制茶厂——马桑塔茶厂。
    这座茶园和茶厂是中国帮助几内亚建设的，已经在今年二月二十二日隆重举行竣工典礼。茶园从一九六三年八月开始开荒播种，种植面积不断扩大。茶厂在一九六六年一月动工修建，在一九六七年三月全部竣工并投入试生产。
    这个被几内亚人民誉为“马桑塔的明珠”的茶园和茶厂目前生产的红茶和绿茶，不仅满足了几内亚广大人民的需要，还有少量出口。每当几内亚朋友们谈起马桑塔茶园和茶厂的时候，他们总是说：“饮茶思念种茶人。我们应该全心全意感谢伟大领袖毛主席派来这样好的中国技术人员帮助我们。”
        原始草原变茶林
    中国种茶技术人员来到马桑塔的达雷拉地区开辟茶园的时候，那里是一片野草和杂树丛生的荒原。加上几内亚气候只有干雨两季，在长达半年的雨季中，经常是昼夜暴雨如注；在干季，常常是晴空万里，烈日当空，地面温度有时高达摄氏四十度以上。这种气候条件也给开荒种茶的任务带来不少困难。
    中国技术人员牢记毛主席关于“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，同几内亚工人紧密合作，付出了艰巨的劳动，开垦了大片沉睡的原始草原。他们数年如一日，风里来，雨里去，早出晚归，同几内亚工人一起栽树、施肥。经过三年零十个月的日夜奋战，终于提前两个月超额完成了大面积茶树种植任务，把达雷拉这片荒原变成了一片碧波荡漾的茶海。
    马桑塔茶园确实是中几两国工人用心血和汗水浇灌出来的又一簇友谊之花。
      毫不利己　专门利人
    开辟马桑塔这一大型茶园用了近四年时间，而修建这座机械化的制茶厂，也经过一年零两个月的紧张劳动。中国施工技术人员在到达几内亚后，以白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神为榜样，自己动手搭起简陋的房屋，并立即投入紧张的战斗。工作刚开始时没有交通工具，他们就每天起早，带上干粮，步行十几公里到工地工作；晚上，披星戴月走回住所。原马桑塔区区长巴里·伊卜拉希玛说：“中国工程技术人员为我们几内亚做的工作很多很多，而生活上对我们要求却很少很少。”
    在建设茶厂的过程中，中国技术人员遵循毛主席关于勤俭办一切事业的教导，处处为几内亚人民着想，精打细算。土建施工需要大量黄沙和石块，中国技术人员就自己上山开采，没花费一个钱。为了节省装卸费用，他们又直接动手卸下从科纳克里开来的货车。建厂用的大批材料和机器设备，大多数也是他们利用休息时间卸下来的。他们还利用工余时间，收集旧元钉、小木板和瓦楞铁皮等，修建了一些辅助车间、材料仓库和肥料农药仓库，还为在那里劳动的几内亚工人修了两间浴室。这既满足了茶厂和茶园生产的需要，还为几内亚节省了大量开支。
    几内亚工人在谈起这些事的时候，无不竖起大拇指，赞不绝口地说：“毛主席派来的技术人员一点也不考虑自己，处处专为我们几内亚人民着想。他们是很受尊敬的人。”
    一九六六年十月，暴雨把马桑塔到布佛苏之间的公路和几座木桥都冲坏了。这时候，中国技术人员反复学习了伟大导师毛主席的完全彻底为人民服务的教导，成立了一支修路突击队，八次去三十公里外的地方抢修。没有木料就到林中去砍，没有石块就到山上去凿。
    当冲坏的公路眼看就要修好的时候，突然乌云压顶，雷声轰鸣，瓢泼大雨劈头盖脸地浇了下来。他们全身湿透，却高唱起毛主席语录歌：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”一直坚持劳动。在场的一位几内亚朋友激动地说：“我们从来也没有见过象中国这样好的技术人员。他们真不愧是毛主席教导出来的。”很多过路的几内亚群众目睹这个动人的场面，深受感动，也纷纷参加了修路。
    一位几内亚朋友说：“中国技术人员不仅为我们修建茶厂，还为我们修桥铺路，只要对我们几内亚人民有利的事，他们都干。中国技术人员的这种全心全意为我们工作的精神，我们是永远不会忘记的。”
        中几人民情谊深
    中国技术人员坚决贯彻我国对外援助八项原则，毫无保留地把技术教给几内亚工人，尽力地为几内亚培养一支完备的种茶和制茶技术队伍。他们把工人组织起来，系统地给他们讲授技术和理论知识。中国技术人员不会当地语言，于是他们就一再示范，耐心地把操作方法教给几内亚工人。他们还积极地学习当地语言，以便更好地向几内亚工人传授技术。
    经过中国技术人员几年的耐心帮助和几内亚工人的勤奋学习，几内亚第一代茶业技术人员已成长起来，他们已掌握了种茶、制茶的各项专业技术。现在，制茶厂的各车间、各部门基本上都是由几内亚人员管理，工作井井有条，相当出色。老工人伊卜拉希玛激动地说：“我跟法国人做过几十年工，除了挨打受气以外，到头来什么都没有学会。但是跟中国技术人员时间并不长，我就学会了栽种、修剪、施肥、规划空行等差不多全套种茶技术。这证明，中国技术人员是我们的亲兄弟，中国的援助是真诚无私的。”
    在几年的共同劳动中，中国技术人员和几内亚工人之间建立了深厚的友谊。这友谊就象年轻的茶林一样，迅速而茁壮地成长着。
    中国技术人员王德绥到马桑塔后就分配带青年徒工苏·阿玛杜。阿玛杜身上长了疮，影响工作。王德绥怀着阶级感情，每天下班后细心地用盐水替他洗疮，然后涂上药水。过了半个月，阿玛杜的疮就治好了。
    其他中国技术人员关心几内亚工人疾苦、助人为乐的生动事例也很多。
    有一天，中国茶树栽培技术人员戴志达发现几内亚工人牛凯没有来上班，趁休息时间赶到牛凯家里看望。戴志达发现牛凯患了急性肠胃炎，上吐下泻，病情危急。戴志达就急忙找来了一辆车子，把牛凯送到他的住处，马上请来中国医生给他治疗，把牛凯抢救过来。
    有一次，戴志达同志病倒了。在他生病期间，每天都有许许多多几内亚工人到他的住处来看望他，问寒问暖，关心备至。
    中国朋友看到几内亚男工的衣服破了，就拿出自己的针线包一针一针地替他们缝补。几内亚采茶女工早上采茶时，因为露水大，把衣服都打湿了。中国技术人员发现了，就找来了装肥料的塑料袋，缝成防水围裙送给她们。中国同志的这种深厚的阶级感情，常常使几内亚工人感动得热泪盈眶。锻工阿叶巴·胡卢为了纪念这种崇高的友谊，特地用中国同志的姓，取作孩子的名字。
    毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    通过中国技术人员的一言一行，马桑塔茶园、茶厂的几内亚工人和当地居民看到了毛泽东思想哺育下的中国工人阶级的高贵品质，看到了战无不胜的毛泽东思想的无比巨大的威力。他们更加热爱全世界人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，更加崇敬伟大的毛泽东思想。
    很多几内亚工人把得到毛主席像、《毛主席语录》和毛主席像章，看成是最大的幸福。他们把毛主席像用镜框装起来，挂在家里最显著的地方；把毛主席像章佩戴在胸前，嵌在帽上。有的工人不仅自己努力学习毛主席著作，还利用星期天和节日，给亲友和邻居读《毛主席语录》。
    一位叫卡玛拉·桑吉亚纳的几内亚朋友说：“在我们几内亚，没有人不了解中国，没有人不知道伟大的领袖毛泽东主席的。毛主席是全世界革命人民心中永远不落的红太阳。我们无限热爱和敬仰伟大的导师毛主席。”
    最近，当记者参观马桑塔茶厂的时候，一些几内亚青年工人把记者团团围了起来，要求送给他们最最珍贵的礼物——毛主席像章。他们争先恐后地说：“我最最热爱毛主席！”当这些青年小伙子们得到毛主席像章时，他们高兴得跳了起来，不断地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”“祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
