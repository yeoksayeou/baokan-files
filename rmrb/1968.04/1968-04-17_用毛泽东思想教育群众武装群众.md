What should be done if an accident occurs during production? The revolutionary committee of the Tonghua Grape Wine Factory's approach is to use Mao Zedong Thought to educate and arm the masses. The entire factory's workers have raised their awareness of overcoming anarchism, strengthened labor discipline, and the revolutionary and production landscape has been transformed.

The Tonghua Grape Wine Factory's revolutionary committee in Jilin Province follows the People's Liberation Army's path of emphasizing proletarian politics. They correctly handle accidents in production, raise the entire factory's workers' awareness of overcoming anarchism, strengthen labor discipline, and increase production enthusiasm. The revolutionary and production landscape has been completely renewed.

The factory's revolutionary workers, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, achieved revolutionary great unity and the three-in-one combination after September last year, and completed the 1967 production task 70 days ahead of schedule. Just as this good situation was unfolding, an alcohol leakage accident occurred. On the evening of January 3 this year, alcohol was delivered, and the storage team dispatched 14 workers to unload the truck overnight. Due to the influence of anarchist thoughts, some workers did not strictly follow the operating procedures. When transferring alcohol to the No. 86 cement tank, they did not carefully check the valve, thinking "everything is fine." One hour later, it was discovered that the valve was not tightly closed, causing some alcohol to leak and resulting in a loss to the state. This accident sparked discussions in various workshops and teams. Some said, "This accident has tarnished the reputation of the first factory in Tonghua region to achieve the three-in-one combination. Punishment must be given."

How should this accident be handled? The revolutionary committee had two opinions: one was to impose disciplinary action, otherwise it would seem that the revolutionary committee had no authority; the other was to emphasize proletarian politics and start from ideological education. The committee members seriously studied Chairman Mao's teaching that "controlling ideological education is the key link in uniting the whole party to engage in great political struggles." They unanimously agreed that whether to impose disciplinary action or to strengthen ideological education was a big issue of how the newly established revolutionary committee should exercise power. Only by emphasizing proletarian politics and adhering to using Mao Zedong Thought to educate and arm the masses could anarchist thoughts be truly overcome, labor discipline strengthened, and the broad masses of workers united to jointly grasp revolution and promote production. The revolutionary committee finally unanimously decided to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, using the alcohol leakage accident as a breakthrough to conduct political education for the entire factory's workers, thoroughly overcoming anarchism. Replace the pressure of "self" with the power of "public."

The director of the revolutionary committee, Liu Shaohua, personally presided over the Mao Zedong Thought study class held by the storage team, using Chairman Mao's relevant discussions on opposing anarchism to specifically analyze the accident.

Initially, after this accident, the members of the storage team were worried about being punished and felt a lot of pressure. After studying Chairman Mao's works, everyone conducted a specific analysis of the so-called "pressure," believing that "pressure" has two kinds: some comrades felt pain in their hearts due to the loss of state property, and it is natural to have some pressure in their minds, which is the pressure of "public," a driving force to improve work; some comrades only cared about personal gains and losses, fearing to bear the responsibility of violating labor discipline, which is a manifestation of selfishness, the pressure of "self." To correctly accept the lessons from the accident, one must replace the pressure of "self" with the power of "public" to thoroughly eliminate the influence of anarchist thoughts.

To break selfishness and establish public spirit, one must raise each person's class consciousness. In the study class, they organized old workers to talk about the contrast between past and present societies. Zhang Zhengquan, who has worked in the grape wine factory for 25 years, recounted his experiences. At 17, he was taken by the Japanese devils to be a laborer, eating acorn flour, wearing "regenerated thread," and escaping from the jaws of death, his body wrapped in cement bags. Later, he entered the grape wine factory, and the capitalist treated the workers even more cruelly. The nail box worker Liu Zhijiu, who worked with him, had his right hand cut off by a machine, and the factory manager, the Japanese devil Yangkou, kicked him out of the factory that day, still laughing wickedly and saying, "Chinese people are great!" Zhang Zhengquan said with tears in his eyes, "In the old society, capitalists treated us workers like cattle and horses, but in the new society, Chairman Mao has raised us workers to the position of masters. The factory belongs to the state, and we must have the attitude of a master towards state property." Zhang Zhengquan's words aroused everyone's class consciousness. The workers said, the old society made workers suffer from private ownership, but today's workers' sweet life is the sweetness of public ownership. We workers, relying on "public" to rise up, relying on "public" to be the masters, relying on "public" to hold power, without "public," there would be no interests for the working class. We workers can also be said to be the class that emphasizes "public," and every worker should be a person who is dedicated to the public. Young worker Han Zongqin, linking his thoughts, said painfully, "The occurrence of the alcohol leakage accident shows that anarchism has crept into my heart. After the accident, one should seriously find the cause in one's thoughts and accept the lessons, but I still considered personal gains and losses, which is selfishness." Anarchism is the enemy hidden in the mind.

The members of the storage team solved their ideological problems, but did the ideological and political work end there? The revolutionary committee members seized the alcohol leakage incident as a living example to conduct anti-anarchism education for the entire factory's workers.

In discussions across all workshops and teams in the factory, most comrades followed Chairman Mao's teachings, linked the alcohol leakage incident, and voluntarily checked themselves for not strictly following operating procedures, being late or leaving early, and other anarchist phenomena. However, some said, "Alcohol leakage is a big issue, but our shortcomings are only 'nine cows and one hair,' and they are not related to anarchism." In response to this active thought, the leadership organized everyone to carry out the "three thinkings and three lookings" activity: first, think about the pain of the poor in the old society who had no revolutionary power, and see the importance of the proletarian dictatorship; second, think about the facts of class enemies using anarchism to sabotage the revolution and production during the Cultural Revolution, and see the harm of anarchism; third, think about the current complex and sharp class struggle, and see the importance of opposing anarchism. Through exposing the crimes of anarchism, everyone realized that anarchism is the enemy hidden in the mind, with various forms of manifestation, varying degrees, but the reactionary essence is one, which is to oppose the proletarian dictatorship. Therefore, in violating labor discipline, whether it is a big issue or a small issue, it must be eliminated. The packaging team, which is mostly female workers, had some who were late or left early, doing personal things during work hours, and they previously thought it was not a big issue. Now they voluntarily check and correct themselves. Young worker Wang Xi in the major repair workshop said with deep feelings, "In the past, I worked late at night and left early in the morning, fixing my own house at home, thinking it was a small matter. Now I know it is wrong. Chairman Mao cultivates us young workers as the seeds of the revolution, but the anarchist thoughts are like poisonous insects corroding us. Only by killing the bad insect of anarchism can we become good revolutionary seeds." Always follow the path of emphasizing proletarian politics.

The revolutionary committee of the grape wine factory seized the typical case of alcohol leakage, actively learned and applied Mao Zedong Thought, emphasized proletarian politics, and significantly raised the proletarian consciousness of the entire factory's revolutionary workers.

Chairman Mao said, "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." The consciousness of the broad revolutionary workers has been raised, and they voluntarily learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, voluntarily overcome the anarchist thoughts in their minds. The storage team extensively studied and applied the "Old Three Articles," forming a trend of firmly guarding their posts, not leaving an inch, strictly following operating procedures, and being meticulous. These living facts deeply educated the revolutionary committee and all the workers in the factory, making everyone realize that: the newly established revolutionary committee wants to exercise power well, the factory wants to achieve double victories in revolution and production, it must always follow the path of emphasizing proletarian politics, and adhere to using Mao Zedong Thought to educate and arm the masses.

To further raise everyone's understanding of emphasizing proletarian politics, the revolutionary committee is organizing each team to link up with the actual situation of the two-line struggle in the factory in the past, expose the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev in the enterprise management line, who advocated material incentives and "deduct, fine, stop, and punish" revisionism, further raising the broad workers' awareness of the two-line struggle.

Now, the Tonghua Grape Wine Factory follows Chairman Mao's teachings in everything, placing the study and implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions in a position higher than everything else. In this way, the entire factory's revolution and production have shown a new situation. The first quarter's production task has been completed a month ahead of schedule.

     生产出了事故怎么办？通化葡萄酒厂革委会的做法是——
     用毛泽东思想教育群众武装群众
     全厂职工提高了克服无政府主义的自觉性，加强了劳动纪律，革命和生产面貌焕然一新
    本报讯　吉林省通化葡萄酒厂革命委员会，走解放军突出无产阶级政治的道路，正确处理生产中的事故，提高了全厂职工克服无政府主义的自觉性，加强了劳动纪律，提高了生产积极性，革命和生产面貌焕然一新。
    葡萄酒厂广大革命职工，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在去年九月以后先后实现了革命大联合和革命三结合的基础上，提前七十天完成了一九六七年生产任务。就在这一片大好形势下，发生了一次跑酒精的事故。今年一月三日晚上，运来了酒精，贮藏组派出十四个工人连夜卸车。由于无政府主义思潮的影响，一些工人没有严格遵守操作规程，在向八十六号水泥池子输送酒精时，没有仔细检查闸门，就认为“太平无事”了。一小时后，发现闸门没关严，跑掉了一部分酒精，给国家造成了损失。这次事故，引起各车间、班组议论纷纷。有的人说：“这个事故给我们通化地区第一个实现三结合的厂子抹了黑，可得给予处分。”
    应当怎样对待这次事故呢？革委会也有两种主张：一种是，实行纪律处分，不这样就显得革命委员会太无职无权了；另一种是，突出无产阶级政治，从思想教育入手。革命委员会的成员认真学习了毛主席
  “掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节”的教导，一致认为实行纪律处分，还是加强思想教育，是新生的革命委员会如何掌权用权的大问题，只有突出无产阶级政治，坚持用毛泽东思想教育群众，才能真正克服无政府主义思潮，加强劳动纪律，把广大职工群众拧成一股绳，同心协力抓革命促生产。革委会最后一致决定通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，把跑酒精事故作为突破口，向全厂职工进行一次政治教育，彻底克服无政府主义。去掉“私”字压力，换成“公”字动力革委会主任刘少华，亲自主持贮藏组开办的毛泽东思想学习班，用毛主席有关反对无政府主义的论述，对事故进行了具体分析。
    起初，贮藏组的同志在发生这次事故以后，担心受处分，思想压力大。学习毛主席著作以后，大家对所谓“压力”进行了具体分析，认为“压力”有两种：一些同志因国家财产受到损失而感到痛心，思想上有些压力是自然的，这是“公”字的压力，是改进工作的动力；有的同志只是计较个人得失，怕承担违反劳动纪律的责任，这是私心的表现，是“私”字的压力。要正确接受事故的教训，必须把“私”字压力换成“公”字动力，才能彻底地肃清无政府主义思潮的影响。
    要破私立公，必须提高每个人的阶级觉悟。在学习班里，他们组织老工人讲今昔社会对比。在葡萄酒厂工作二十五年的老工人张正泉讲述了自己的经历。他十七岁被日本鬼子抓去当劳工，吃的是橡子面，穿的是“更生线”，从虎口里出来，身上围的是水泥袋子。后来进了葡萄酒厂，资本家对工人更毒辣，和他一起工作的钉箱工人刘志久右手被机器轧断，葡萄酒厂厂长日本鬼子山口，当天就把他赶出了厂门，还恶狠狠地奸笑着说：“中国人大大的有！”张正泉眼泪汪汪地说：“旧社会资本家拿咱工人当牛马使唤，新社会毛主席把咱工人扶上了主人翁的地位。工厂是国家的，对国家财产就得有个主人的态度。”张正泉的话激发了大家的阶级觉悟。工人们说，旧社会工人是受私有制的苦，今天工人生活甜是公有制的甜。我们工人阶级，翻身靠“公”，当家靠“公”，掌权靠“公”，离开“公”，就没有我们工人阶级的利益。我们工人阶级也可以说是突出“公”字的阶级，每个工人都应该是一心为公的人。青年工人韩宗钦，联系自己的思想痛心地说：“发生了跑酒精事故，说明无政府主义钻进了我的心脏里。出了事故，本应认真从思想上找原因，接受教训，可是自己还考虑个人得失，这就是私。”无政府主义是隐藏在头脑中的敌人
    贮藏组同志们的思想问题解决了，是不是思想政治工作就算做到头了呢？革命委员会的同志抓住跑酒精这个活教材，对全厂职工进行一次反对无政府主义的教育。
    全厂各车间、各班组在讨论中，大多数同志遵照毛主席的教导，联系跑酒精一事，自觉地检查了不严格遵守操作规程、迟到早退等无政府主义现象。但也有人说：“跑酒精是大问题，咱们有缺点也不过是‘九牛一毛’，同无政府主义挂不上钩。”针对这个活思想，领导上组织大家开展了“三想三看”活动：一想旧社会穷人没有革命政权的痛苦，看无产阶级政权的重要性；二想文化大革命运动中阶级敌人利用无政府主义破坏革命和生产的事实，看无政府主义的危害性；三想当前阶级斗争复杂、尖锐，看反对无政府主义的重要性。通过大摆无政府主义的罪状，大家认识到无政府主义是隐藏在头脑中的敌人，表现形式多种多样，程度有轻有重，但反动本质是一个，就是不要无产阶级政权，因此在违反劳动纪律上不论大问题还是小问题，都要加以清除。包装组绝大多数是女工，有些人迟到早退，工作时间干私事，过去以为不是大问题，现在他们主动检查改正。大修车间青年工人王喜深有体会地说：“过去，晚上班、早下班，在家里修自己房子，以为是小事，现在知道是错误的。毛主席把我们青年工人当成革命的苗子培养，而无政府主义思潮象毒虫一样在腐蚀我们，只有杀死无政府主义这个坏虫子，才能成为革命的好苗子。”永远走突出无产阶级政治的道路
    葡萄酒厂革命委员会，抓住了跑酒精典型事例，活学活用毛泽东思想，突出无产阶级政治，使全厂革命职工无产阶级觉悟有了很大提高。
    毛主席说：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”广大革命职工觉悟提高了，自觉地活学活用毛主席著作，自觉地克服头脑中无政府主义思潮。贮藏组大学大用“老三篇”形成了风气，做到坚守岗位，寸步不离，执行操作规程，一丝不苟。这些活生生的事实，深深地教育了革委会和全厂职工，使大家认识到：新生的革命委员会要想掌好权、用好权，工厂要夺取革命生产的双胜利，必须永远走突出无产阶级政治的道路，坚持用毛泽东思想教育群众、武装群众。
    为了进一步提高大家对突出无产阶级政治的认识，革委会正组织各班组联系本厂过去两条路线斗争的实际情况，控诉中国赫鲁晓夫在企业管理路线上大搞物质刺激，大搞“克、扣、停、罚”的修正主义的罪行，进一步提高了广大工人的路线斗争的觉悟。
    现在，通化葡萄酒厂时时事事按毛主席教导办事，把学习和落实毛主席最新指示放在高于一切的地位。这样，使全厂革命和生产出现了一派新气象。第一季度生产任务早已提前一个月完成。
