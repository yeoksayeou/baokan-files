The 50th Electric Shovel Team of the Red Guard Open-Pit Mine in Fushun Makes New Contributions to Ensure Coal Production

The 50th Electric Shovel Team of the Red Guard Open-Pit Mine in Fushun, composed mainly of seven veteran miners, has always adhered to Chairman Mao's teachings of "grasping the revolution and promoting production" during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have upheld the revolutionary responsibility of the working class, observed socialist labor discipline, overcome various difficulties, and consistently fought on the production front. From last August to the present, they have excavated 351,000 cubic meters of filling shale for the state, making new contributions to ensuring coal production in the three large mines of the Fushun mining area.

In August last year, a handful of capitalist roaders within the party took advantage of the differences in opinions between the two revolutionary mass organizations in the Fushun mining area, stirring up trouble, creating chaos, and attempting to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and production. At this critical moment, the veteran miners of the 50th Electric Shovel Team of the Red Guard Open-Pit Mine, including Duan Chengfang, Tian Yushan, Wang Yongcai, Zhang Fuxing, Liu Guangsheng, Cao Fenghui, and Yang Yongcun, heard that the supply of shale for filling the three large mines in the Fushun mining area was running short, which could potentially cause a major accident. They immediately recalled Chairman Mao's teachings of "grasping the revolution and promoting production" and thought of the revolutionary responsibility of the working class. Without hesitation, they joined many revolutionary workers and cadres to work in shifts day and night. However, someone labeled them as "typical slaves." At this time, the comrades of the People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team studied Chairman Mao's works with everyone. Chairman Mao taught: "What is work? Work is struggle. Where there are difficulties and problems, we need to go and solve them. We work and struggle to overcome difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go, this is what a good comrade should do." These veteran miners, through the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, resisted the wrong trends. They made a firm decision to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory. They said: The more difficult it is, the more it tests us. We must defend Chairman Mao, defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and defend the overall interests of the working class to the death! We must give a resounding blow to the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the Fushun area with our actual actions!

With boundless love and loyalty to Chairman Mao, they insisted on going up the mine to do a good job in the revolution and down the mine to do a good job in production. They insisted on making a revolution on the spot, making a revolution in their spare time, and making a revolution through saving. Once, the 60-year-old old driver Duan Chengfang, after handing over his shift, had already walked more than 300 meters away from the electric shovel. Looking back, he saw another row of empty cars entering the mining area. He thought of Chairman Mao's teachings of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people and turned back to load this row of cars before happily going home.

To produce more and better coal for the country and ensure the smooth progress of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, these veteran miners always prioritize revolutionary interests, fearing neither hardship nor fatigue, and daring to sacrifice themselves. At one point, the veteran miner Tian Yushan had an infected toe, making it painful for him to walk. However, he still endured the pain and hobbled to work. Some young people advised him to rest at home for a few days, but Tian Yushan said: "The production of the mine is continuous, one link after another. We cannot leave our posts because of a small illness and affect the entire mine's production!"

    发扬无产阶级高度革命责任感
    抚顺红卫露天矿采掘段五十号电铲组为保证煤炭生产作出新贡献
    抚顺红卫露天矿采掘段由七名老矿工为主组成的五十号电铲组，在无产阶级文化大革命中始终遵照毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的教导，发扬工人阶级的革命责任感，遵守社会主义劳动纪律，克服种种困难，一直战斗在生产岗位上。他们仅从去年八月到现在，就为国家采掘了三十五万一千多立方米的充填页岩，为保证抚顺矿区三座大型矿井的煤炭生产作出了新贡献。
    去年八月份，党内一小撮走资派，利用抚顺矿区两大革命群众组织间的意见分歧，挑拨离间，煽风点火，制造混乱，妄图破坏无产阶级文化大革命和生产。正在这时，红卫露天矿五十号电铲组的老矿工段成芳、田玉山、王永才、张福兴、刘广生、曹凤辉、杨永存等七人，听说抚顺矿区三座大型矿井充填用的页岩供应不上了，很可能造成大事故。他们立即想起毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的教导，想到了工人阶级的革命责任，二话没说，便和许多革命职工、革命干部一道，昼夜轮流坚持生产。可是，有人竟说他们是“典型的奴隶主义”。这时，解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的同志跟大家一起学习毛主席著作。毛主席教导说：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。那些地方有困难、有问题，需要我们去解决。我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”这几名老矿工通过活学活用毛主席著作，顶住了歪风。他们下定决心，要排除各种困难，去争取胜利。他们说：越是困难，越是考验我们的时候。我们就是要誓死保卫毛主席，誓死保卫毛主席的革命路线，誓死保卫工人阶级的整体利益！我们就是要以实际行动，给中国赫鲁晓夫和他在抚顺地区的代理人以迎头痛击！
    他们怀着无限热爱、无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级感情，坚持上井搞好革命，下井搞好生产，坚持就地闹革命、业余闹革命、节约闹革命。有一次，六十岁的老司机段成芳交完班，已走出离电铲有三百多米远的地方，回头看见采掘场子又开进一排空车，他想起毛主席“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的教导，转回身来，又继续装完这排车才高高兴兴地回家。
    为了给国家多出煤，出好煤，保证无产阶级文化大革命顺利进行，这些老矿工时时都以革命利益为重，不怕苦，不怕累，奋不顾身。有个时期，老矿工田玉山因脚趾感染，痛得不能走路。可是，他还是忍着疼痛，一瘸一拐地坚持上班。有些青年劝他在家休息几天，田玉山却说：“矿山的生产是连续作业，一环扣一环，咱可不能因为一点小病就离开工作岗位，影响整个矿山的生产！”（据新华社）
