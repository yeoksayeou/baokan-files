Mao Zedong Thought is the beacon lighting the path of revolution for the world's people. The single-volume editions of Chairman Mao's works have been published in Pakistan.

New China News Agency, Lahore, April 21st - The brilliant works of the great teacher Chairman Mao have recently been translated into the national language of Pakistan, Urdu, and published in Pakistan, receiving a warm welcome from the Pakistani people.

Recently, the Karachi Publishing House published four single-volume editions of Chairman Mao's works in Urdu, collecting six of Chairman Mao's brilliant works: "The Founding of the Communist Party," "The Founding of the Chinese Workers' Movement," "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," "Rectifying the Party's Style of Work," "The Current Situation and the Party's Tasks," and "On the Establishment of the Party Committee System."

Each single-volume edition features a portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao, with the words "Mao Zedong - the Lenin of our time" printed underneath.

Many Pakistani people, after studying Chairman Mao's works, have expressed their heartfelt love for the great leader Chairman Mao and their love for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

A letter from the distant Swat region of West Pakistan states that Mao Zedong Thought is the beacon lighting the correct revolutionary path for all the people of the world to oppose all oppressors. The letter says, "The great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, with his great genius, has pointed out the correct direction for the revolutionary cause of China and the world."

An old worker from Rawalpindi, after studying "Quotations from Chairman Mao," said, "Every word of Chairman Mao Zedong is the truth. Every sentence in his works is for the benefit of the poor and oppressed people."
