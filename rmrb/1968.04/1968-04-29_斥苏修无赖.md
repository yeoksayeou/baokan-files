On March 23, the second mate of the Soviet ship "Ukrainian Komsomol" named Ponomarchuk, with the connivance and protection of the captain Koshakov, brazenly engaged in espionage activities in our Huangpu Port. After a thorough investigation by our port authorities, conclusive evidence was obtained, and they were expelled from the country on April 4.

We, the border inspection personnel and workers of Huangpu Port, the southern gateway of our motherland, are armed with Mao Zedong Thought and are the vanguard fighters against imperialism and revisionism. To safeguard the security of our motherland, uphold national sovereignty, and maintain the dignity of our laws, we have resolutely fought against the serious crimes committed by the lackeys of the Soviet revisionist renegade clique. This is completely just.

What infuriates us is that after the "Ukrainian Komsomol" was expelled back to its country, the Soviet revisionist renegade clique used this incident to stir up an anti-China wave. In recent days, they have been instructing Koshakov and Ponomarchuk to appear in public, making all sorts of excuses and denials; at the same time, they have been operating their propaganda machine, spreading a large amount of anti-China rumors, claiming that this Soviet ship was "illegally detained" and that the crew members were subjected to "violent actions." They attempt to cover up their evil deeds with such despicable tactics of distorting right and wrong.

The leaders of the "Ukrainian Komsomol" in Huangpu Port engaged in what activities and committed what crimes, Ponomarchuk and Koshakov, as well as the mouthpieces of the Soviet revisionist renegade clique, dare not speak a word about these crucial issues. This only shows how guilty and nervous they are.

We, the workers of Huangpu Port, are witnesses to the entire process of this incident. We have sufficient facts and arguments to refute the lies of the Soviet revisionist renegade clique.

On March 23 at 14:04, the "Ukrainian Komsomol" was on its way to Humen from the garbage tail island in Huangpu Port. The second mate Ponomarchuk secretly took photographs from the right window of the deck of our naval vessels and the terrain of the Humen Fort, which were moored dozens of meters away. When our inspection personnel boarded the ship for inspection, Ponomarchuk denied this criminal act. He first said that he had not taken any photos, then said that the photos were taken in Vladivostok and the open sea, stammering and contradicting himself, looking anxious. Later, under the stern questioning of our inspection personnel, he attempted to expose the film to destroy the evidence, but was immediately stopped by our border inspection personnel. The photos were developed on the spot, revealing the terrain of our military ships and the Humen Fort, and this guy could only stare in disbelief and admit his crime.

Ponomarchuk's espionage crime, of course, should be detained and punished by our port authorities. However, Captain Koshakov openly protected Ponomarchuk, making various excuses to try to exonerate Ponomarchuk's crime. He claimed that taking military photos was "unconscious." Such deceitful talk was refuted by our personnel. It is a well-known international custom that military facilities of a country should not be photographed in its ports. As responsible personnel of a Soviet long-distance ship, how can they knowingly commit such acts and claim to be "unconscious"? If it was "unconscious," why did Ponomarchuk not dare to admit taking the photos and instead tried to expose the film to destroy the evidence? In fact, the leaders of this Soviet ship not only consciously engaged in espionage activities this time but also had previously spied on our military intelligence.

The so-called "violent actions" shouted by the Soviet revisionist newspapers are sheer nonsense. Our port authorities have shown a friendly attitude towards ordinary Soviet crew members from the beginning. Despite the captain's instigation of some uninformed crew members to prepare iron hammers, daggers, and other weapons to threaten and provoke our personnel, attempting to escalate the situation, we still patiently engaged in reasoning with them. To ensure the crew's food needs, our foreign ship supply unit repeatedly expressed willingness to provide food and supplies at any time. Many ordinary crew members had repeatedly nodded and shaken hands in approval of our friendly attitude. As for the Soviet journalists' fabricated rumors about the ship's female cleaner suffering from "nervous shock" and "miscarriage," it is sheer nonsense. Because the captain was afraid that ordinary crew members would contact our personnel, he had already isolated and sealed them off. Throughout the entire case handling process, no Soviet female worker appeared before our personnel.

Under the resolute exposure and powerful struggle of our port authorities, due to the presence of both human and material evidence, Captain Koshakov of the "Ukrainian Komsomol" finally had to admit in the confession with his own signature that "second mate Ponomarchuk, while sailing in the Humen area, took photos of the military ships of the People's Republic of China." However, under the instructions of the Soviet revisionist renegade clique, they now come out shouting and distorting facts, attempting to wash their hands of the crimes they committed. Apart from further exposing the despicable and shameless faces of these anti-China clowns, what else can they gain?

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "'Lifting a stone only to drop it on one's own foot,' this is a Chinese proverb describing the behavior of some fools. The reactionaries of all countries are precisely such a bunch of fools." The Soviet revisionist renegade clique and their followers, Koshakov and Ponomarchuk, are precisely such a bunch of fools. The more they try to cover up their ugliness with slander and lies, the uglier they become!

    斥苏修无赖
    广州黄埔港  齐卫国
    三月二十三日，苏联船“乌克兰共青团员”号二副波诺马尔楚克在船长柯夏科夫纵容包庇下，公然在我国黄埔港进行间谍活动。我港口当局经过认真的检查，掌握了确凿的罪证以后，已于四月四日驱逐他们出境。
    我们守卫着祖国南大门的黄埔港区边防检查人员和工作人员，是用毛泽东思想武装起来的反帝反修的前哨战士。为了保卫祖国的安全，维护国家主权和法律尊严，我们对苏修叛徒集团走卒的这种严重罪行进行了坚决的斗争，是完全正义的。
    使我们感到极大愤怒的是，“乌克兰共青团员”号被驱逐回国以后，苏修叛徒集团竟然利用这一事件掀起反华浪潮。连日来，他们一面指使柯夏科夫和波诺马尔楚克抛头露面，百般狡辩抵赖；一面又开动宣传机器，大量散布反华谰言，胡说什么这艘苏联船被“非法扣留”，船员们遭到了“暴力行动”。他们妄想用这种颠倒黑白的卑劣手段来掩盖自己的罪恶行径。
      “乌克兰共青团员”号的这两个头目在黄埔港干了什么勾当，犯了什么罪行，波诺马尔楚克和柯夏科夫以及苏修叛徒集团的喉舌对于这些要害问题是根本不敢吭声的。这只能说明，他们是多么理屈词穷，做贼心虚。
    我们黄埔港的工作人员，是这一事件全部过程的见证人，我们有充分的事实和论据来驳斥苏修叛徒集团的这种谎言。
    三月二十三日十四时零四分，“乌克兰共青团员”号在黄埔港垃圾尾岛进入虎门的途中，二副波诺马尔楚克在右舷窗内偷偷地拍摄了当时停泊在数十米外的我海军舰艇和我虎门要塞的地形。当我检查人员登轮检查时，波诺马尔楚克矢口否认这一犯罪行为。他一会儿说根本没有拍过照，一会儿又说照片是在海参崴和公海上拍的，支吾其词，前后矛盾，神色慌张。后来，在我检查人员严词责询下，他又企图将所摄底片曝光灭迹，当即被我边防检查人员制止。照片当场冲洗出来，显出我国军舰和虎门要塞地形以后，这个家伙才瞠目结舌，不得不低头承认自己的罪行。
    波诺马尔楚克的这种间谍罪行，当然应当受到我国港口当局的拘留和制裁。但是船长柯夏科夫却公然对波诺马尔楚克进行包庇，制造种种借口，想为波诺马尔楚克开脱罪责。他胡说什么，拍摄军事照片是“无意识的”。这种欺人之谈，遭到了我方人员的有力驳斥。在他国港口内不得拍摄该国军事设施的照片，这是人所共知的国际惯例。作为苏联远洋航船的负责人员，竟然明知故犯，怎么能说是“无意识的”呢？如果是“无意识的”，波诺马尔楚克为什么不敢公开承认拍照，而两次企图曝光灭迹？事实上，这艘苏联船的头目不仅这次是“有意识”地进行间谍活动，而且过去也曾刺探过我国的军事情报。
    苏修报纸大叫大嚷的所谓“暴力行动”，完全是耍无赖。我港口当局对于苏联普通船员自始至终表示友好态度。尽管船长唆使一些不明真相的船员准备铁锤、匕首之类的凶器，对我方人员进行威胁挑衅，企图扩大事态，我们仍然耐心地进行说理斗争。为了保证船员的饮食需要，我外轮供应单位多次主动表示愿意随时提供饮食物品。许多普通船员对于我们这种友好态度曾一再点头握手表示赞许。至于苏修记者捏造的所谓船上女清洁工遭到“神经震荡”和“小产”的谣言，更是无稽之谈。因为船长深怕普通船员与我方人员接触，早已对他们进行隔离封锁。在整个案件处理过程中，我方人员面前根本没有出现过任何一个苏联女工。
    在我港口当局的坚决揭露和有力斗争下，由于人证物证俱在，“乌克兰共青团员”号船长柯夏科夫最后不得不在有其亲笔签名的认罪书中承认，“二副波诺马尔楚克，当航行在虎门地区航道的时候”，拍摄了“中华人民共和国军舰的照片”。可是，在苏修叛徒集团的指使下，他们现在又跳出来大喊大叫，颠倒黑白，企图把自己所犯的罪行推得一干二净。这除了更加清楚地暴露出这一伙反华小丑的卑鄙无耻的嘴脸之外，又能捞到什么呢？
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。”苏修叛徒集团及其追随者柯夏科夫、波诺马尔楚克之流，也就是这样的一批蠢人。他们越是想用造谣诬蔑来为自己遮丑，就只能越遮越丑！
