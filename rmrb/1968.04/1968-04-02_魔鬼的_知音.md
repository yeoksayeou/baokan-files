The propaganda chief of U.S. imperialism, the Director of the United States Information Agency, Maxwell, recently made a speech, openly praising the Soviet revisionist clique for providing convenient channels for the reactionary propaganda of "Voice of America." He said with satisfaction: "Now, the 'Voice of America' broadcasts to the Soviet Union are 'effective' and 'no longer interfered with.'"

The Washington clique naturally deserves this praise from the Soviet revisionist traitors. However, the people of the world have once again seen that the Soviet revisionist leaders are "servants and henchmen kneeling before imperialism."

What is the "Voice of America"? In the words of former U.S. President Kennedy, it is "an arm of the U.S. government." Through the "Voice of America" broadcasts, U.S. imperialism spreads rumors and slanders, engages in anti-communist, anti-China, and anti-people activities, promotes the American way of life, corrupts the fighting will of the people of various countries, and engages in various conspiracies and sabotage. The so-called "Voice of America" is nothing but the voice of the devil, the voice of evil.

However, this notorious "Voice of America" is regarded as a treasure by the Soviet revisionist clique. Soon after the 20th Congress of the CPSU, the Soviet revisionist clique began to intermittently stop interfering with the "Voice of America" broadcasts to the Soviet Union. Later, the Soviet revisionists reached an agreement with the U.S. imperialists to formally and completely stop interfering with the "Voice of America," and even directly broadcast programs supplied by the "Voice of America." After Brezhnev and Kosygin came to power, they opened the green light for the "Voice of America," allowing it to pass freely throughout the Soviet Union. Recently, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique even reprinted in full an anti-communist article broadcast by the "Voice of America" in the "Literary Gazette," openly spreading the ideological poison of U.S. imperialism among the Soviet people.

The Soviet revisionist traitor clique is so eager to build an air bridge between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. This not only caters to the needs of U.S. imperialism but also aims to accelerate the full restoration of capitalism at home. They want to use the seductive music of U.S. imperialism to anesthetize the Soviet people and use this black "arm" of the U.S. government to prop up their shaky bourgeois dictatorship in the Soviet Union.

In fact, the Soviet revisionist clique does not just open the door for the "Voice of America." Now, the Soviet revisionist radio has already become a branch of the "Voice of America." American newspapers have proudly said that the broadcasts and television programs of the Soviet revisionists, from content, form to technique, have been "thoroughly reorganized" according to Western broadcasts and television. The "Voice of America" in Washington and the Soviet revisionist voice in Moscow have been singing in unison in anti-China, anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-revolutionary propaganda. These two reactionary radio stations, one spreads rumors and slanders, the other distorts black and white; one advocates "Sino-American cooperation," the other promotes "parallel but not conflicting"; one peddles the American way of life, the other advocates "complete Westernization." They sing in harmony, completely in sync.

The praise that the Director of the U.S. Information Agency gave to the Soviet revisionist clique this time is only a small part of the "achievements" of this group of traitors.

### 魔鬼的“知音”

    魔鬼的“知音”
    美帝国主义的宣传头目、美国新闻署署长麦克斯最近发表谈话，公开夸奖苏修集团为“美国之音”的反动宣传大开方便之门。他满意地说：现在“美国之音”对苏联的广播“是有效的”，“没有再受到干扰”了。
    对于华盛顿的这番赞赏，苏修叛徒集团自然是受之无愧的。但是，全世界人民却由此又一次看清了苏修头目“是跪倒在帝国主义面前的奴仆和爪牙”。
    “美国之音”是什么玩艺儿？用美国前总统肯尼迪的话来说，它是美国“政府的一只臂膀”。美帝国主义通过“美国之音”的广播，造谣诽谤，反共、反华、反人民，推销美国生活方式，腐蚀各国人民斗争意志，进行种种阴谋破坏的勾当。所谓“美国之音”，不过是魔鬼之音，罪恶之音。
    但是，这个臭名昭著的“美国之音”，却被苏修集团奉为至宝。早在苏共二十大后不久，苏修集团就开始断断续续地停止干扰“美国之音”的对苏广播。后来，苏修又同美帝达成协议，正式全面停止对“美国之音”的干扰，并且直接播送“美国之音”供应的节目。勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流上台后，更是为“美国之音”大开绿灯，让它在苏联全境畅通无阻。最近，苏修叛徒集团甚至在《文学报》上全文转载“美国之音”播送的反共文章，公然向苏联人民散布美帝国主义的思想毒素。
    苏修叛徒集团这样起劲地架设美苏之间的空中桥梁，这不仅是迎合美帝国主义的需要，而且是为了在国内加速全面实现资本主义复辟。他们想用美帝国主义的靡靡之音来麻醉苏联人民，借用美国政府的这一只黑“臂膀”来支撑他们在苏联的摇摇欲坠的资产阶级专政。
    其实，苏修集团岂止是为“美国之音”敞开门户而已。现在，苏修电台早已变成“美国之音”的分号了。美国报纸曾得意洋洋地说，苏修的广播和电视节目，从内容、形式到技巧，都已按照西方广播电视来“进行彻底的改组”。华盛顿的“美国之音”和莫斯科的苏修之音，在反华、反共、反人民、反革命的宣传方面，更是一直在进行二重唱。这两家反动电台，你造谣诽谤，他颠倒黑白；你鼓吹“苏美合作”，他宣扬“并行不悖”；你贩卖美国生活方式，他提倡“全盘西化”。此唱彼和，完全是一搭一档。
    美国新闻署署长这次对苏修集团所夸奖的，只不过是这伙叛徒的“功绩”的小小一部分罢了。
