In the midst of revolutionary criticism, conducting bitter-sweet remembrance as a form of class education is an effective and vivid method. Through bitter-sweet remembrance, we can focus all our hatred on the old society, on imperialism, the Kuomintang reactionaries, all exploiting classes, and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, as well as on the Chinese Khrushchev and his reactionary bourgeois line. We can focus all our gratitude on the new society, on the great leader Chairman Mao, the great Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Old revolutionary workers all have a bitter and deep account of suffering from the old society, a tragic history of blood and tears. They understand best: if the Chinese Khrushchev's plot to restore capitalism succeeds, the broad masses of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants will suffer twice. Their personal experiences are living textbooks for class education and line struggle education for the younger generation, and they are heavy artillery for criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionism.

Today, we publish several articles by old workers from the Beijing Mentougou Coal Mine, recalling their bitter past to stir up hatred, arouse proletarian feelings, and better raise the class consciousness and line struggle consciousness of the broad revolutionary masses.

The great teacher Chairman Mao teaches us: "Throughout the transitional period, there exist class contradictions, there exists the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and there exists the struggle between the two lines of socialism and capitalism. To forget this basic theory and basic practice of our Party for more than a decade would lead one astray."

The Chinese Khrushchev, however, openly spreads lies: "The class struggle has basically ended, there are fewer counter-revolutionaries, ... the most important task of the state in the future is to organize social life." When we hear these lies, we want to drag him to our Mentougou to let him see with his own eyes the sharp and complex facts of class struggle. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we drove out the imperialists, overthrew the bureaucrat capitalists, feudal overlords, and toppled their evil rule. By the end of 1948, the Mentougou Coal Mine returned to the hands of the people. However, the class enemies were not reconciled to their downfall and, with tenfold ferocity and a hundredfold hatred, they carried out sabotage and disruption. In the early days of liberation, they attempted to blow up the mine, but were discovered by the workers and failed.

After the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the means of production in our country, the Chinese Khrushchev was heartbroken about our great victory. He jumped out, screaming like a madman, "The class struggle has basically ended," in an attempt to achieve his evil goal of abolishing the dictatorship of the proletariat and restoring capitalism. The great teacher Chairman Mao pointed out in opposition: "The class struggle has not ended." Although the means of production of the exploiting classes have become state-owned or collectively owned, they are still alive and their hearts are not dead. They are constantly spreading reactionary ideas and carrying out counter-revolutionary restoration activities. In 1957, a rightist element in our mine read reactionary articles attacking the Party in the newspapers and shouted with joy. He maliciously attacked the socialist system and plotted a counter-revolutionary conspiracy, which was uncovered by our public security department. In 1962, when the Kuomintang bandits attempted to invade the mainland, the class enemies were like those who had been injected with morphine, their spirits revived. Some said: "There is hope, it's our turn to come out again." In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, along with reactionary capitalists, traitors, spies, and unrepentant landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, all jumped out, stirring up wave after wave of counter-revolutionary restoration currents. A landlord element gathered a group of demons and monsters to threaten the public security organs to remove their four-category element hats and repeatedly instigated armed struggles, carrying out mad class revenge and sabotaging the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Countless facts show that for more than a decade since liberation, the sharp and complex class struggle has never stopped. The Chinese Khrushchev's theory of "the extinction of class struggle" is completely a lie. Does he really not want class struggle? No! He does not want the proletariat to struggle against the bourgeoisie, does not want the dictatorship of the proletariat, but wants the bourgeoisie to struggle against the proletariat, wants the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. He peddles the theory of "the extinction of class struggle" to create public opinion for his opposition to the socialist revolution and the abolition of the dictatorship of the proletariat, covering up the class enemies' attacks on the proletariat and restoring capitalism.

The agents of the Chinese Khrushchev in the Mentougou Coal Mine faithfully carried out their master's counter-revolutionary revisionist line. They sang the tune of "the extinction of class struggle" with their mouths, but did the work of restoring capitalism. For example, capitalists receiving dividends can join the union, and four-category elements and rightists are all to have their hats removed with a single blow of wind, some even to be recruited into the Party and promoted to cadres. When our country's economy temporarily encountered difficulties, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party in our mine, along with capitalists, four-category elements, and spies, colluded to organize speculation and profiteering groups, stealing and selling large quantities of state-important raw materials and equipment, sabotaging the socialist economy, and brazenly attacking the dictatorship of the proletariat. The working class of the Mentougou Coal Mine, under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, has resolutely fought against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and all class enemies, repelling their attacks time and time again, achieving one victory after another, and smashing their plots to restore capitalism.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under socialist conditions. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and its led broad revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." The practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution fully proves that Chairman Mao's latest instruction is an unshakable truth. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a thrilling class struggle, a political revolution. The Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, along with their agents in our mine, represent the interests of the Kuomintang reactionaries, that is, the bourgeoisie, traitors, spies, landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. Many of them are themselves Kuomintang spies, traitors, and class aliens who have infiltrated the Party. Our struggle with them is a continuation of the struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries. If we do not overthrow them, the proletarian dictatorship will change its nature, and the socialist state will change its color. After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, the class struggle has not ended. We must take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, firmly remember Chairman Mao's great teachings, "Never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat," and grasp class struggle, resolutely strike down the rightist reversal wind, deeply and persistently carry out the revolutionary criticism, actively and unceasingly launch fierce attacks on the class enemies, thoroughly criticize and expose the Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and their agents in our mine, and root out all hidden traitors, spies, and counter-revolutionaries.

    阶级斗争并没有结束
    北京矿务局门头沟煤矿革命委员会    
    编者按：在革命的大批判中，进行忆苦思甜的阶级教育，是一种生动的能够收到切实效果的好办法。通过忆苦思甜，把千仇万恨集中到旧社会，集中到帝国主义、国民党反动派、一切剥削阶级和党内一小撮走资派，集中到中国赫鲁晓夫和他提出和推行的资产阶级反动路线上；把千恩万爱集中到新社会，集中到伟大领袖毛主席、伟大的毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上。
    革命的老工人，在旧社会都有一本苦大仇深的辛酸账，一部悲惨的血泪史。他们最懂得：如果中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的阴谋得逞，广大工人和贫下中农就要受二遍苦。他们的亲身经历是对青年一代进行阶级教育和路线斗争教育的活教材，也是批判中国赫鲁晓夫反革命修正主义的重炮弹。
    今天，这里发表的北京门头沟煤矿老工人忆苦思甜，痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫的“剥削有功”和“阶级斗争熄灭”论的几篇文章，就是以苦引恨，激发无产阶级感情，更好地提高广大革命群众的阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟的活材料。
    伟大导师毛主席教导我们说：“整个过渡时期存在着阶级矛盾、存在着无产阶级和资产阶级的阶级斗争、存在着社会主义和资本主义的两条道路斗争。忘记十几年来我党的这一条基本理论和基本实践，就会要走到斜路上去。”
    中国赫鲁晓夫却大白天说鬼话：“阶级斗争基本结束，反革命分子少了，……今后国家最重要的任务是组织社会生活。”我们听到他这些鬼话，恨不得把他揪到我们门头沟，让他睁开鬼眼看看这尖锐复杂的阶级斗争的事实。共产党毛主席领导我们赶走了帝国主义者，打倒了官僚资本家、封建把头，推翻了他们的罪恶统治。一九四八年底，门头沟煤矿回到了人民手中。但是，阶级敌人对于他们的垮台是不甘心的，他们以十倍的疯狂，百倍的仇恨进行破坏和捣乱。解放初期，他们企图炸毁矿井，被工人发觉，才未得逞。
    在我国生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本完成以后，中国赫鲁晓夫对于我们这一伟大胜利痛心疾首，他跳出来，发疯一样地大喊大叫“阶级斗争基本结束”，以图达到他取消无产阶级专政、复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。伟大导师毛主席针锋相对地指出：“阶级斗争并没有结束。”剥削阶级的生产资料虽然已成为国家所有或集体所有，但他们人还在，心不死，随时都在散布反动思想，进行反革命复辟活动。一九五七年，我矿一个右派分子看了报纸上右派向党进攻的反动文章，高兴得大声叫好。他恶毒攻击社会主义制度，并策划一个反革命阴谋，被我公安部门破获。一九六二年蒋匪帮妄图窜犯大陆，阶级敌人象扎了吗啡针，精神来了。有的说：“有指望了，又该咱们出头露面了。”史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，党内一小撮走资派和反动资本家、叛徒、特务以及没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子纷纷跳出来，掀起一股股反革命复辟逆流。一个地主分子纠集牛鬼蛇神威胁公安机关给他们摘掉四类分子帽子，并一再挑动武斗，疯狂地进行阶级报复，破坏无产阶级文化大革命。
    无数事实说明，解放十几年来，尖锐复杂的阶级斗争一天也没有停息过。中国赫鲁晓夫“阶级斗争熄灭”论完全是骗人的鬼话。他真的不要阶级斗争吗？不是！他不要无产阶级对资产阶级斗争，不要无产阶级专政，而是要资产阶级对无产阶级斗争，要资产阶级专政。他叫卖“阶级斗争熄灭”论，就是为他反对社会主义革命，取消无产阶级专政制造舆论，掩护着阶级敌人向无产阶级进攻，复辟资本主义。
    中国赫鲁晓夫在门头沟煤矿的代理人，忠实地推行其主子的反革命修正主义的路线，他们嘴里唱着“阶级斗争熄灭”论的调子，干的却是复辟资本主义的勾当。如拿定息的资本家可以入工会，四类分子、右派分子一风吹，全摘帽，有的要吸收入党，提拔当干部。在我国经济暂时遇到困难的时候，我矿党内一小撮走资派和资本家、四类分子、特务勾结，组织投机倒把集团，大量盗卖国家重要原料和器材，破坏社会主义经济，猖狂地向无产阶级专政进攻。我们门头沟煤矿的工人阶级，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的指引下，和党内一小撮走资派、一切阶级敌人进行了坚决的斗争，打退了他们一次又一次的进攻，取得一个又一个胜利，粉碎了他们复辟资本主义的阴谋。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”无产阶级文化大革命的实践，充分证明了毛主席这一最新指示是颠扑不破的真理。无产阶级文化大革命就是一场惊心动魄的阶级大搏斗，就是政治大革命。中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大一小撮走资派及其在我矿的代理人，他们代表了国民党反动派即资产阶级、叛徒、特务、地、富、反、坏、右分子的利益，他们有好多本身就是混进党内的国民党特务、叛徒和阶级异己分子。我们和他们的斗争，就是同国民党反动派斗争的继续。我们不把他们打倒，无产阶级政权就要变质，社会主义国家就要变色。革命委员会成立以后，阶级斗争并没有结束。我们一定以毛主席最新指示为纲，牢记毛主席的伟大教导，“任何时候都不可忘记阶级斗争，不可忘记无产阶级专政”，狠抓阶级斗争，坚决打击右倾翻案妖风，深入地持久地开展革命大批判，主动地不停顿地向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻，把中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大一小撮走资派及其在我矿的代理人，批倒批臭，把隐藏的叛徒、特务和反革命分子统统挖出来，彻底打倒。
