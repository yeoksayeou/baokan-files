The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: “A party committee with one or two dozen people is like a squad in the army. If this ‘squad’ does not act in unison, it will be impossible to lead tens of thousands of people into battle or to build something.” To lead a revolutionary army that is unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao, we must first ensure the ideological transformation of the leadership team and build a leadership team that is unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao.

Transforming the party committee ideologically is a necessity for the construction of the army and for preventing and countering revisionism.

Using the thought of Mao Zedong as the guiding principle, we have undergone a process of transforming our own ideological consciousness from being relatively unconscious to relatively conscious.

In 1964, the counter-revolutionary revisionist element Luo Ruiqing spread the evil wind of mass military competitions throughout the army. The army, influenced by this evil wind, saw an increase in negative tendencies, and the proportion of “four good” companies decreased during the final evaluation. These problems made us reflect: Why did the political direction of the army get disrupted, and why couldn’t we see it clearly or resist it? Later, we studied Comrade Lin Biao’s instructions on emphasizing politics and unanimously agreed: Although the problems occurred in the army, the responsibility lies with us leaders. The army’s emphasis on politics is insufficient, primarily because the party committee’s emphasis on politics is insufficient. If our minds are filled with non-proletarian thoughts, how can we recognize and resist the evil winds blown by counter-revolutionary revisionists? How can we lead the army to emphasize proletarian politics? This made us realize that whether or not we transform the party committee ideologically is a major issue in the struggle between the two lines and a major issue of loyalty to Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao teaches us: “In the process of building a socialist society, everyone needs to be transformed.” However, we previously thought that since we came from good backgrounds and had been tested in war, we were loyal to Chairman Mao and had decided to follow him. Therefore, we were more concerned about the army having many problems and less concerned about our own problems, focusing more on transforming others’ thoughts and less on transforming our own. We deeply realized: In the deepening of the socialist revolution, if we carry the burden of blind self-satisfaction and relax our ideological transformation, it is very dangerous. We would not be able to closely follow Chairman Mao and maintain our revolutionary integrity. From then on, we consciously studied and applied the thought of Mao Zedong, using our own learning to drive the army’s learning and using our own experiences in transforming our thoughts to guide the army’s ideological transformation. We resisted the revisionist element Luo Ruiqing’s advocacy of centrism and firmly emphasized proletarian politics.

In the great proletarian cultural revolution, we repeatedly studied Chairman Mao’s theories, lines, principles, methods, and policies on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. We further realized: The issue of the leadership team is the issue of political power. To transform the party committee members ideologically and build a leadership team that is unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao is not only the key to the construction of the army but also a top priority for preventing and countering revisionism and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat. Party committee secretary Xiao Fengshan comrade deeply felt: “Leaders can only use the thought of Mao Zedong to eliminate the ‘selfish’ character in their minds, becoming unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao, unlimitedly loyal to the thought of Mao Zedong, and unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line. Only then can we keep our political power always red, and only then can we lead the masses to keep moving forward.”

Break the thought of being an official and a lord, and establish the thought of being a servant of the people.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: “Communist Party members must not detach themselves from the masses, must not stand above the masses, and must not be officials and lords”; “All our working cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people, and everything we do is for the people’s service.”

Why didn’t we understand and keep up with some new things that emerged during the cultural revolution? By studying Chairman Mao’s teachings and analyzing our own thoughts, we realized that one of the reasons was that the “official” character was at work. Because of the thought of being an official and a lord, we usually wanted to maintain the status quo and live a stable life in our later years; because of the thought of being an official and a lord, we could not correctly treat the revolution, correctly treat the masses, and correctly treat ourselves; because of the thought of being an official and a lord, we could not correctly implement Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line. The thought of being an official and a lord is the thought of the exploiting class and the thought of the Chinese Khrushchev. The Chinese Khrushchev always tempts people to pursue high positions and rich rewards, to pursue privileges and enjoyment. Whether to be a servant of the people or an official and a lord is a major issue of whether to follow Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line or the reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev, and a major issue of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao.

“Without destruction, there can be no construction.” Only by thoroughly breaking the thought of being an official and a lord and establishing the thought of being a servant of the people can we resolutely implement and defend Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line. Party committee member and rear service department head Wen Baozhu comrade, while executing the task of supporting the left in a certain coal mine, had the thought of fear due to the “official” character. With the help of the party committee, he studied Chairman Mao’s relevant teachings on the mass line and realized: How to treat the masses is an issue of which line to implement. Without thoroughly breaking the “official” character, one cannot correctly treat the masses. He then studied “In Memory of Norman Bethune” and fought against the “official” character. With the attitude of a servant of the people, he went down to the coal mine with the workers, conducted in-depth investigations, and clarified that both major organizations were revolutionary mass organizations. He insisted on the principle of supporting the left without supporting factions. Wen Baozhu comrade deeply felt: “Having the style of being an official and a lord will hinder the correct implementation of Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line.”

Only by thoroughly breaking the thought of being an official and a lord and establishing the thought of being a servant of the people can we be unlimitedly loyal to Chairman Mao’s military line. Last February, party committee deputy secretary and deputy division commander Zhang Shengwu comrade led a regiment to support the left in a certain place. At that time, he thought: If the task is completed well, I will have a share of the credit, but if there are problems, it will leave a bad impression on the superiors. Under the influence of this thought, he only focused on the support task and did not focus on the ideological work of the support personnel, resulting in more and more ideological problems in the army and poor propaganda effects on the masses. He studied Chairman Mao’s teachings: “Mastering ideological education is the central link in uniting the whole party to wage great political struggles. If this task is not solved, the party’s political tasks cannot be completed.” He realized: Executing political tasks also requires emphasizing politics. Without transforming the ideology of the support personnel, the support task cannot be well completed. He realized that his single-minded task view was due to the influence of fame and wealth. After his understanding improved, he proposed to the party committee the suggestion of strengthening the ideological construction of the company during the execution of the support task. The party committee firmly supported his suggestion. Because we insisted on the political direction of building the army as indicated by Chairman Mao, the support work became better and better, and the proportion of “four good” companies increased by 8 percent during the final evaluation.

To thoroughly break the thought of being an official and a lord and establish the thought of being a servant of the people, we made a decision according to Chairman Mao’s teachings: “People’s work is different, and their positions are different, but no matter how high the position, they must appear as ordinary laborers among the people. It is absolutely not allowed to put on airs.” In politics, we study Chairman Mao’s works with the soldiers, recall hardships together, expose our thoughts together, fight against selfishness together, and criticize revisionism together. In life, we blend with the masses, insisting on eating, living, working, training, and entertaining with the masses. The masses reacted very positively to this, and more importantly, it greatly promoted our ideological transformation.

Following Chairman Mao’s teachings, go to the masses to transform our thoughts.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: “We must solve the problem of the relationship between superiors and subordinates well and improve the relationship between cadres and the masses. In the future, cadres should go to the lower levels to walk around and see things, insist on the mass line, and consult with the masses on everything. Be a small student of the masses.” Only by going to the masses can we be heart to heart with them. The closer we are to the masses, the deeper our loyalty to Chairman Mao and the closer we follow Chairman Mao.

Some comrades do not listen to the masses’ criticisms. We repeatedly studied Chairman Mao’s teachings: “The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and laughable, not understanding this point, we cannot obtain even the most basic knowledge.” We overcame the thought of thinking ourselves superior to the masses and corrected our attitude towards the masses’ criticisms. Facts made us deeply realize: Whether or not to listen to the masses’ criticisms is an issue of whether or not to revolutionize. Fear of criticism is fear of revolution, and to revolutionize, one must not fear criticism.

To better obtain the masses’ help, we often expose our thoughts to the masses. Political department deputy director Miao Guangjin comrade previously thought that cadres exposing their thoughts was only to lead the subordinates and the army; after going to the masses, he found that political instructor Liu Xiangfa was working hard on self-revolution, which inspired him. Later, he changed his previous attitude, bravely exposing his selfishness and fighting against it among the masses, humbly accepting the masses’ help, and continuously improving his thoughts. Political commissar Li Xifeng comrade, while conducting a pilot evaluation in an artillery regiment, sought opinions in the class where he lived, but the soldiers only said good things about him and did not mention his shortcomings, and the reflection on the company’s situation was also brief. Later, he exposed his thoughts to the soldiers, and the soldiers, seeing that he was sincerely letting the masses help him revolutionize, immediately gave him active and enthusiastic help.

The more people know about one’s shortcomings, the more supervision there is, making one more determined to correct them. Several party committee standing committee members often actively expose their thoughts among the masses, participate in the use of Mao Zedong Thought lectures, with some comrades giving lectures more than ten times a year and the least three to five times, from small lectures in a department or company committee to large lectures in a thousand-person military meeting. The soldiers reflected that they were very clear about the thoughts of the division leaders. In this way, it provided convenient conditions for the masses to supervise our ideological transformation and help us achieve ideological transformation. Several leaders of our division also required the guard platoon to constantly supervise us.

The party committee’s ideological transformation drove the army’s ideological transformation. The broad cadres and soldiers of the entire division are loyal to our great teacher Mao Zedong with a single “loyalty” and grasp the use of the invincible thought of Mao Zedong with a single “use.” There are more and more active learners of the thought of Mao Zedong, and the number of “four good” companies is increasing. In early 1967, the entire division had five relatively backward companies, and by the end of the year, three companies had entered the ranks of the “four good.”

    把党委建成无限忠于毛主席的领导班子
    沈阳部队活学活用毛泽东思想先进集体　某师党委
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“党的委员会有一二十个人，象军队的一个班，……如果这‘一班人’动作不整齐，就休想带领千百万人去作战，去建设。”要带出一支无限忠于毛主席的革命部队，必须首先搞好领导班子的思想革命化，建设一个无限忠于毛主席的领导班子。
      搞好党委思想革命化，是部队建设
  的需要，是防修反修的需要
    用毛泽东思想挂帅，抓党委自身思想革命化，我们经历了一个由不很自觉到比较自觉的认识过程。
    一九六四年，反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿在全军刮起了大比武妖风，部队由于受到大比武妖风的影响，不良倾向增多，总评时四好连队比例下降。这些问题，引起我们的深思：为什么部队政治方向受到了干扰，我们看不清、顶不住呢？后来我们学习了林副主席关于突出政治的指示，一致认为：问题虽然发生在部队，责任却在我们领导身上。部队突出政治不够，首先是由于党委突出政治不够。自己头脑里有非无产阶级思想，怎么能够识破、顶住反革命修正主义分子刮起的妖风呢？怎么能够领导部队突出无产阶级政治呢？这使我们认识到，搞不搞党委自身思想革命化，是在两条路线斗争中站在哪一边的大问题，是忠不忠于毛主席的大问题。
    毛主席教导我们：“在建设社会主义社会的过程中，人人需要改造”。可是，我们过去总认为自己出身好，经过战争考验，是忠于毛主席的，跟毛主席是跟定了的。因此，担心部队出问题多，考虑自己出问题少，抓别人的思想改造多，抓自己的思想改造少。我们深深认识到：在社会主义革命深入发展的时候，如果背着盲目自满的包袱，放松思想改造，那是很危险的。那就不能紧紧跟上毛主席，就不能保持革命的晚节。从这以后，我们就自觉地活学活用毛泽东思想，以自己的学习带动部队的学习，以自己改造思想的体会指导部队的思想改造，顶住了反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿极力鼓吹的折中主义，坚定地突出了无产阶级政治。
    在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们反复学习毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策，进一步认识到：领导班子的问题，就是政权问题。抓好党委成员的思想革命化，建设一个无限忠于毛主席的领导班子，不仅是部队建设的关键，而且是防修反修、巩固无产阶级政权的头等大事。党委书记萧凤山同志深有感触地说：“领导干部只有用毛泽东思想斗掉头脑里的‘私’字，做到无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，才能使我们的政权永远保持鲜红的颜色，才能带领广大群众不断前进。”
      大破做官当老爷的思想，大立做人
  民勤务员的思想
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“共产党员绝不可脱离群众，绝不可高踞于群众之上，做官当老爷”；“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员，我们所做的一切，都是为人民服务”。
    为什么我们对文化大革命中出现的一些新鲜事物不理解、跟不上？学习毛主席的教导，分析自己的思想实际，我们认识到，原因之一就是“官”字在作怪。因为有做官当老爷的思想，平时就总想维持现状，安安稳稳过好后半辈子；因为有做官当老爷的思想，就不能正确对待革命、正确对待群众、正确对待自己；因为有做官当老爷的思想，就不能正确执行毛主席的革命路线。做官当老爷的思想，是剥削阶级的思想，是中国赫鲁晓夫的思想。中国赫鲁晓夫总是引诱人们追求高官厚禄，追求特权和享受。做人民勤务员，还是做官当老爷，这是关系到跟毛主席的革命路线走，还是跟中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线走的大问题，是对伟大领袖毛主席忠不忠的大问题。
      “不破不立”。只有大破做官当老爷的思想，大立做人民勤务员的思想，才能坚决执行和捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。党委委员、后勤部长温宝珠同志，在某煤矿执行支左任务时，由于“官”字作怪，存在着怕的思想。在党委的帮助下，他带着这个问题，认真学习毛主席有关群众路线的论述，认识到：如何对待群众，这是执行什么路线的问题。不大破“官”字，就不能正确对待群众。于是他学习了《为人民服务》，狠斗了“官”字，以做人民勤务员的姿态，和工人一起下矿井，深入调查研究，弄清了两大组织都是革命群众组织，坚持了支左不支派的原则。温宝珠同志深有体会地说：“有做官当老爷的思想作风，就会妨碍正确地执行毛主席的革命路线。”
    只有大破做官当老爷的思想，大立做人民勤务员的思想，才能无限忠于毛主席的建军路线。去年二月，党委副书记、副师长张绳武同志带领一个团到某地支左。他当时想的是：任务完成得好有我一份成绩，如果出了问题，就会给上级留下不好的印象。在这种思想支配下，他只抓支左任务，不抓支左人员的思想工作，结果部队思想问题越来越多，对群众宣传效果也不好。他学习毛主席的教导：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。如果这个任务不解决，党的一切政治任务是不能完成的”，认识到：执行政治任务，也要突出政治。不搞好支左人员的思想革命化，就不能很好地完成支左任务。自己所以产生单纯任务观点，是名利思想作怪。认识提高以后，他向党委提出了在执行支左任务中加强连队思想革命化建设的建议，党委坚决支持了他的建议。由于坚持了毛主席指引的政治建军的方向，支左工作越做越好，总评时四好连队比例上升百分之八。
    为了大破做官当老爷的思想，大立做人民勤务员的思想，我们按照毛主席“人们的工作有所不同，职务有所不同，但是任何人不论官有多大，在人民中间都要以一个普通劳动者的姿态出现。决不许可摆架子”的教导，作出了防止资产阶级思想侵袭，克服特殊化的决定。在政治上，我们和战士一起，同学毛主席著作、同忆苦、同亮思想、同斗私心、同批修正主义。在生活上我们和群众打成一片，坚持和群众同吃、同住、同劳动、同操课、同娱乐。我们这样做，群众反映很好，更重要的是大大促进了我们的思想革命化。
  遵照毛主席的教导，到群众中去改造思想
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“要很好地解决上下级关系问题，搞好干部和群众的关系。以后干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。”到群众中去，才能和群众心连心。同群众靠得越近，忠于毛主席的感情就越深，跟毛主席就越紧。
    有的同志听不进群众的批评，我们就反复学习毛主席关于“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识”的教导，克服以为自己比群众高明的思想，端正对群众批评的态度。事实使我们深深认识到：愿不愿听群众批评，是要不要革命的问题。怕批评就是怕革命，要革命就不能怕批评。
    为了更好地得到群众的帮助，我们经常把思想亮给群众。政治部副主任苗广金同志过去认为干部亮思想只是为了带动下级和部队；到群众中去以后，发现指导员刘祥发在革自己的命上狠下功夫，深受启发。以后他就改变了过去的态度，勇于到群众中去亮私斗私，虚心接受群众的帮助，使自己的思想不断得到提高。政委李锡文同志在炮兵团搞总评试点时，他在住的那个班征求意见，但战士们对他只说好话，不提缺点，反映连队情况也是三言两语。后来，他向战士们亮了自己的思想，战士们看到他是真心实意地让群众帮助自己革命，就立即对他进行了积极热情的帮助。
    多一个人知道自己的缺点，就多一分监督的力量，使自己多一分改正的决心。党委的几个常委同志，经常主动到群众中亮思想，参加活学活用毛泽东思想讲用会，有的同志一年讲用了十多次，少的也有三、五次，小至在机关一个部门、连队支委会上讲，大至在千人的军人大会上讲。战士们反映，对师首长思想情况一清二楚。这样，就为群众监督我们的思想改造，帮助我们实现思想革命化提供了方便条件。我们师的几个领导干部，还要求警卫排经常监督我们。
    党委进行自身的思想革命，带动了部队的思想革命。全师广大指战员，对我们无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席心怀一个“忠”字，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想狠抓一个“用”字，学习毛泽东思想积极分子越来越多，四好连队上升。一九六七年初全师有五个比较后进的连队，年终总评有三个连队跃入四好行列。
