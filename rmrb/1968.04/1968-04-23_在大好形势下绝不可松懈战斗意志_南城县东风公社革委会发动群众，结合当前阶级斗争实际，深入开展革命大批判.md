According to a report from the *Jiangxi Daily*, the Dongfeng People's Commune Revolutionary Committee in Nancheng County, Jiangxi, has continued to mobilize the masses to carry out revolutionary criticism and struggle, combining this with the current class struggle, and has pushed the movement to study and apply Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts to a new high.

Since the establishment of the commune's revolutionary committee, it has led the broad masses of people to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to criticize and repudiate the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Jiangxi, achieving certain results. In the face of a favorable situation, a handful of class enemies have emerged from the shadows, attempting to sabotage the Cultural Revolution and spring plowing. After analyzing this trend in the class struggle, the commune's revolutionary committee organized all the poor and lower-middle peasants in the commune to restudy Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat. They linked these teachings with the current facts of class enemies engaging in sabotage activities, and launched a fierce criticism of Liu Shaoqi's "theory of the extinction of class struggle," striking down the enemy and educating themselves. Through the revolutionary criticism and struggle, many poor and lower-middle peasants have strengthened their awareness of class struggle. They have further realized that "the enemy will not die out of its own accord." In a favorable situation, "it is absolutely not permissible to relax one's will to fight. Any thought of relaxing the will to fight and any complacency is wrong."

Under the instigation of class enemies, some commune members have shown a tendency to expand their private plots and pay less attention to collective production. In response to this situation, the commune's revolutionary committee organized the masses to study Chairman Mao's teachings on adhering to the socialist road and "seeking no personal gain and working solely for the interests of the people." They launched a fierce criticism of Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Jiangxi for promoting the black goods of "three freedoms and one contract" and the fallacies of "public-private fusion" and "public-private integration," raising the masses' awareness of class struggle and line struggle.

The deepening of the revolutionary criticism and struggle has promoted the movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought among the masses. Currently, the entire commune, based on the establishment of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, has, in combination with the specific situation of spring plowing, universally established Mao Zedong Thought night schools. They organize commune members to bring their problems, study and apply Chairman Mao's works and his latest directives, and continuously carry out revolutionary criticism and struggle, making the struggle against selfishness and the criticism of revisionism permeate the entire spring plowing production.

    在大好形势下绝不可松懈战斗意志
    南城县东风公社革委会发动群众，结合当前阶级斗争实际，深入开展革命大批判
    据《江西日报》报道　江西南城县东风公社革命委员会，结合当前阶级斗争实际，继续深入发动群众开展革命大批判，把活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动推向了新高潮。
    公社革委会诞生以来，领导广大群众，以毛泽东思想为武器，对中国赫鲁晓夫和他在江西的代理人推行的反革命修正主义路线进行了大批判，取得了一定的成绩。在大好形势下，一小撮阶级敌人从阴沟里跳出来，妄图破坏文化大革命和春耕生产。公社革委会分析了这一阶级斗争动向以后，便组织全社贫下中农重新学习毛主席关于阶级斗争和无产阶级专政的教导，联系当前阶级敌人进行破坏活动的事实，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫散布的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，打击了敌人，教育了自己。通过革命大批判，许多贫下中农增强了阶级斗争观念，他们进一步认识到：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。”在大好形势下，“绝对不可以稍微松懈自己的战斗意志，任何松懈战斗意志的思想和轻敌的思想，都是错误的。”
    在阶级敌人煽动下，个别社员有扩大自留地的思想苗头，对集体生产不够关心。针对这一情况，公社革委会又组织群众学习毛主席关于坚持社会主义道路和“毫不利己专门利人”的教导，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在江西代理人推行的“三自一包”黑货和“大公有私”论、“公私溶化”论等谬论，提高了大家的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟。
    革命大批判的深入开展，推动了活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动。目前，全社在大办毛泽东思想学习班的基础上，结合春耕生产的具体情况，普遍开办了毛泽东思想夜校，组织社员带着问题，活学活用毛主席著作和毛主席最新指示，持续地开展革命大批判，使斗私、批修贯穿于整个春耕生产中。
