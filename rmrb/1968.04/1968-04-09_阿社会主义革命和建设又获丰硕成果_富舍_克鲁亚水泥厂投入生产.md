Albania's socialist revolution and construction have achieved new fruits. The Fushë-Krujë Cement Plant began production on March 31, 1968.

NEW DELHI, March 31 (Xinhua) — The Fushë-Krujë Cement Plant in Albania held a grand ceremony to mark the start of its production on March 31.

Kolega, Chairman of the State Planning Commission of Albania, and Theodhori, Minister of Industry and Mines, attended the ceremony.

On this day, the heroic workers of Krujë District, members of agricultural cooperatives, soldiers of the People's Army, students, and young volunteers building the Logara-Fieri railway, dressed in festive attire, carried portraits of Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people, and Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people. They gathered early in the morning at the square in front of the cement plant, which was built with the aid of China. Above the entrance of the cement plant hung large portraits of Chairman Mao and Comrade Hoxha, and a banner reading "Long Live Albanian-Chinese Friendship." The square and the factory were adorned with red flags, and the national flags of both countries fluttered in the wind.

Li Tingqian, Charge d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Albania, and Chinese engineering and technical personnel who helped build the factory were also invited to attend the ceremony.

Dragoti, Minister of Construction of Albania, spoke at the ceremony. He congratulated the workers who built and will operate the factory, as well as the people of Krujë District, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour and the Council of Ministers. He pointed out that under the high level of combat, revolutionary, and creative spirit education of the Party, the workers completed this perfect factory in about forty months, eight months ahead of the original schedule. This is a great political, organizational, and technical achievement.

Dragoti said that during the construction of this factory, our comrades-in-arms in the struggle against imperialism and revisionism, the engineering and technical personnel from great People's China, provided us with tremendous, precious, fraternal, and internationalist aid. These comrades, as glorious soldiers of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, fought side by side with our workers, experts, and employees. This factory will stand as another symbol of the great and unbreakable friendship between our two peoples, forever recorded in history.

Li Tingqian, in his speech, warmly praised the completion and production start of the Fushë-Krujë Cement Plant as another fruitful achievement of the hardworking and brave Albanian people under the correct leadership of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour headed by Comrade Hoxha in the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

Li Tingqian also spoke about the excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao.

Both Dragoti and Li Tingqian, in their speeches, enthusiastically praised the great fighting friendship between the two parties and the two peoples of China and Albania in the struggle against imperialism led by the United States and against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist leadership, as well as in the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

As Dragoti and Li Tingqian spoke, the crowd repeatedly applauded and enthusiastically shouted slogans such as "Enver-Mao," "People's China," and "Friendship is the guarantee."

Finally, Comrade Kolega cut the ribbon to mark the start of production and, together with the crowd, toured the factory.
