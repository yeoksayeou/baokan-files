The military and civilians in the western region of South Vietnam, located on the Ca Mau Peninsula, have been fighting continuously for one and a half months from January 31 to March 15, achieving the splendid result of annihilating more than 18,000 enemy troops.

Among the annihilated enemy forces are 2,440 American invaders. Ten enemy battalions and 38 companies (including five American companies) were completely annihilated or suffered heavy losses. The military and civilians in the western region also destroyed a large number of enemy combat equipment, including shooting down and destroying 375 aircraft of various types, destroying 247 military vehicles (including 80 armored vehicles), destroying 28 cannons, sinking and damaging 77 ships, blowing up 40 bridges, and burning down 18 warehouses.

During this period, the local people, who rose up to fight, closely cooperated with the People's Liberation Armed Forces to smash many "pacification" organizations of the U.S.-puppet clique, capturing and forcing the enemy to withdraw from 347 strongholds, outposts, and fortresses, liberating 24 townships and 250 villages with a population of more than 500,000.

Facing the powerful offensive of the People's Liberation Armed Forces and the local people, the enemy's morale has further declined, with more than 30,000 puppet soldiers, police, and government officials disintegrating, many of whom have surrendered to the people and joined the ranks of the anti-American, national salvation struggle.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on March 30, the military and civilians of Phu Yen Province in South Vietnam continuously surrounded, attacked, and shelled many enemy strongholds and outposts in the first half of March, and ambushed and intercepted enemy reinforcements, killing nearly 300 enemy troops and shooting down two enemy aircraft.

The military and civilians of Phuoc Long Province (part of the former Lam Dong Province) launched a fierce attack on enemy strongholds and bases in the Kim Hoa and Thanh Binh areas on the night of March 17 and 18, simultaneously bravely intercepting enemy reinforcements, killing and wounding 220 enemy troops, including the complete annihilation of two enemy security companies.

The military and civilians of two counties, Duc Ho and Duc Hue, in Tien Giang Province, launched fierce attacks on the U.S.-puppet army from March 12 to 17, smashing the enemy's multiple "sweeping" operations, annihilating more than 700 enemy troops, most of whom were American invaders, destroying more than 50 tanks and armored vehicles, and shooting down 21 enemy aircraft.

The People's Liberation Armed Forces in Ba Ria Province launched a fierce artillery attack on the Australian mercenary army's Thua Mountain base on March 21. The shells accurately hit the enemy command center, parking lot, artillery positions, and airfield inside the base, killing and wounding many enemy troops.

The People's Liberation Armed Forces and guerrilla forces in My Tho City bravely attacked the "advisory" quarters of the U.S. Fourth Tactical Zone in My Tho City from March 14 to 17, and intercepted U.S.-puppet troops in the suburbs, killing a total of 283 enemy troops, including 133 American troops.
