Just as we are celebrating the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee in Mao Zedong's hometown of Hunan Province, we have received the latest wise instructions from our great leader Mao Zedong: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution under the conditions of socialism, where the proletariat opposes the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. It is a continuation of the long struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the revolutionary masses under its leadership and the Kuomintang reactionaries. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Chairman Mao's latest instructions deeply elucidate the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, profoundly reveal the class content of the Cultural Revolution, and point the way for us to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. It is the order for us to actively and persistently attack the class enemies. We, the revolutionary masses of Jiangxi Province, must study it earnestly, understand it deeply, and carry it out resolutely!

Over the past two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have clearly recognized that the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev, are essentially the agents of the Kuomintang reactionaries within our Party; China's Khrushchev is the same as Chiang Kai-shek. These scoundrels are either traitors and spies or are landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have infiltrated our ranks. They are our mortal enemies! The counter-revolutionary revisionist line they have been promoting for a long time represents the interests of the bourgeoisie and the landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, i.e., the Kuomintang reactionaries. They attempt to make the broad masses of laboring people suffer twice and be wronged twice. We will never allow this!

Jiangxi is a revolutionary base area personally established by our great leader Chairman Mao, and it is also a place fiercely contested by the enemy of the people, the Kuomintang reactionaries. In the days of revolutionary war, the revolutionary people of Jiangxi, under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao, waged fierce struggles against the Kuomintang reactionaries and won victory after victory. After liberation, a handful of capitalist roaders headed by the big traitor Fang Zhichun usurped the Party, government, and financial powers in our province. They recruited traitors and spies, sheltered landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and colluded with the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries to attempt to impose bourgeois dictatorship on the people of Jiangxi. The people of Jiangxi, who have a glorious revolutionary tradition and are forever loyal to Chairman Mao, have waged a long struggle against the Fang Zhichun clique. In this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have finally exposed Fang Zhichun, this big traitor, and his gang, making them reveal their true colors. Under the leadership of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee, we have pressed on with our victories and launched a "three-investigation" campaign throughout the province (investigating the behind-the-scenes activities of capitalist roaders, traitors and spies, and the sabotage activities of landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists), exposing one after another the stubborn capitalist roaders, traitors, spies, and unrepentant landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who were sheltered by Fang Zhichun and held important positions.

The task before us now is to carry the political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes to the end, and to bury the agents of the Kuomintang reactionaries and their remaining remnants in the vast ocean of the people's war. We must closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, deeply and persistently carry out the great criticism, and expose and denounce the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and their agents in various places politically, ideologically, and theoretically, eliminating all their poisonous influences and thoroughly uprooting the basis for their restoration of capitalism. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, strengthen our class struggle consciousness, raise our awareness of line struggle, smash mountainheadism and sectarianism, resolutely oppose right opportunism, right opportunist splittism, and right opportunist capitulationism, oppose two-faced people, and resolutely strike down the right opportunist wind of rehabilitation. We must strive harder to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, let the great Mao Zedong Thought occupy all ideological positions, and under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, make new contributions to achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    主动地向阶级敌人进攻
    江西省无产阶级革命派大联合筹备委员会
    正当我们欢庆毛主席的家乡湖南省成立革命委员会的大喜日子里，又传来了伟大导师毛主席的最新英明指示：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”毛主席的这一最新指示，最深刻地阐明了无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义，最精辟地揭示了文化大革命的阶级内容，为我们夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利指明了方向，是我们向阶级敌人进行主动持久进攻的进军号令。我们江西省的无产阶级革命派，一定认真学习，深刻领会，坚决照办！
    两年来无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践，使我们清楚地认识到，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在各地区的代理人，实质上就是国民党反动派在我们党内的代理人；中国的赫鲁晓夫也就是蒋介石。这些家伙，有的是叛徒、特务，有的就是混进来的地、富、反、坏、右分子。他们是我们不共戴天的死敌！他们长期以来所推行的反革命修正主义路线，集中地代表了资产阶级和地富反坏右即国民党反动派的利益。他们妄图使广大劳动人民重受二遍苦，重遭二遍罪，我们坚决不答应。
    我们江西是伟大领袖毛主席亲手创建的革命老根据地，也是人民公敌蒋介石反动派拚死争夺的地方。在那革命战争的年代里，我们江西革命人民在毛主席的亲自领导下，向国民党反动派进行了激烈的斗争，夺取了一个又一个的胜利。而解放后，以大叛徒方志纯为首的一小撮走资派窃取了我省的党政财文大权。他们网罗叛徒、特务，包庇地、富、反、坏、右分子，和国民党反动派残留下来的余孽狼狈为奸，妄图对江西人民实行资产阶级专政。富有光荣革命传统的、永远忠于伟大领袖毛主席的井冈山儿女，同方志纯之流进行了长期的斗争。在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，我们终于把方志纯这个大叛徒及其一伙揪了出来，使他们原形毕露。在省革命委员会的领导下，我们乘胜追击，又在全省掀起了
  “三查”（查走资派的幕后活动，查叛徒、特务，查地富反坏右的破坏活动）活动，把方志纯卵翼之下窃踞要职的那些顽固不化的走资派、叛徒、特务和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子，一个个地揪了出来。
    当前摆在我们面前的任务，就是要把这场无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命进行到底，把国民党反动派的代理人及其残留的余孽全部埋葬在“人民战争”的汪洋大海之中。我们一定要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，深入持久地开展革命的大批判，从政治上、思想上、理论上把党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在各地的代理人揭深揭透、批倒批臭，肃清他们的一切流毒，彻底铲除他们复辟资本主义的基础。我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，加强阶级斗争观念，提高路线斗争觉悟，打倒山头主义、宗派主义，坚定地反对右倾保守主义、右倾分裂主义和右倾投降主义，反对两面派，坚决打击右倾翻案妖风。我们要更加努力活学活用毛泽东思想，让伟大的毛泽东思想占领一切思想阵地，在毛主席一系列最新指示的光辉指引下，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利立新功。（附图片）
