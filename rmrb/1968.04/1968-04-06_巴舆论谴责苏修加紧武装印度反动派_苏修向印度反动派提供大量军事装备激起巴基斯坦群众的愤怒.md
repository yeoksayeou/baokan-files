Pakistani public opinion has exposed and condemned the Soviet revisionist clique for stepping up the arming of Indian reactionaries.

According to a report by the *Pakistan Times* on April 4, the total value of various military equipment that the Soviet Union has provided and promised to provide to India is nearly 4.5 billion rupees. This includes 578 various types of military aircraft, 372 tanks, 545 artillery pieces, as well as various naval vessels, radar equipment, and missiles.

The Pakistan News Agency reported on April 3 that many of the military supplies the Soviet Union has given to India were provided after India's armed aggression against Pakistan in 1965, and are directed against Pakistan. The radar equipment provided by the Soviet Union can conduct deep reconnaissance into Pakistani territory. The naval equipment provided by the Soviet Union will seriously threaten maritime communications between East and West Pakistan.

The Pakistan News Agency stated that the Soviet Union's provision of military equipment to India has sparked a wave of anger in Pakistan. On February 10, Pakistani Foreign Minister Pirzada told the press that the Soviet Union's provision of many modern military equipment to India has caused widespread concern in Pakistan, and Pakistan will take any measures it deems necessary.

    苏修向印度反动派提供大量军事装备激起巴基斯坦群众的愤怒
    新华社拉瓦尔品第四日电巴基斯坦舆论揭露和谴责苏修统治集团加紧武装印度反动派。
    据《巴基斯坦时报》四日报道，苏联已经向印度提供和答应将要提供的各种军事装备的总值将近四十五亿卢比，其中包括：五百七十八架各种类型的军用飞机、三百七十二辆坦克、五百四十五门大炮以及各种海军舰艇、雷达设备和导弹等。
    巴基斯坦联合通讯社三日指出，苏联给印度的许多军事装备，都是在一九六五年印度对巴基斯坦进行武装侵略之后提供的，是针对巴基斯坦的。苏联向印度提供的雷达设备，可以对巴基斯坦进行深入的侦察。苏联向印度提供的海军装备，将使东西巴基斯坦之间的海上交通遭到严重的威胁。
    巴基斯坦联合通讯社说，苏联向印度提供军事装备已经在巴基斯坦激起了愤怒的浪潮。巴基斯坦外交部长皮尔扎达二月十日在对报界发表的讲话中指出，苏联向印度提供许多现代化的军事装备，已经在巴基斯坦引起广泛的关切，巴基斯坦将采取它认为必要的任何措施。
