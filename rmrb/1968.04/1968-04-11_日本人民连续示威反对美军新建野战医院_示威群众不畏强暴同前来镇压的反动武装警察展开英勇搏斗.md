More than 2,000 Japanese workers and students held a rally and demonstration on the night of April 8, continuing their opposition to the construction of a new U.S. military field hospital in Tokyo's Kita Ward by the U.S. military stationed in Japan.

The U.S.-Japan reactionary forces are extremely frightened by the growing anti-U.S. struggle of the Japanese people. The reactionary Sato government dispatched a large number of armed police to suppress the anti-U.S. movement. In just one location at Waseda University, over 1,000 armed police savagely suppressed patriotic students who were preparing to attend the rally. The patriotic students fought back against the police and finally broke through the police's heavy cordon, making their way to the rally venue.

Despite various obstacles placed by the Japanese authorities, workers and students held the protest rally as planned and conducted a three-hour demonstration in front of the U.S. military barracks. The fascist police brutally suppressed the demonstrators and illegally arrested more than 20 people.

The demonstrators, carrying red flags with the words "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought!" and banners from various unions and student organizations, chanted slogans such as "Drive U.S. imperialism out of Japan and Asia!" and "Down with the Sato government!" The workers' and students' anti-U.S. demonstration received enthusiastic support from tens of thousands of citizens.

According to another report from the East China News Agency, 1,600 patriotic workers, students, and citizens held a rally in the evening of April 2 in front of Tokyo's Oji Station, continuing their opposition to the construction of the new U.S. military field hospital and strongly protesting the Sato reactionary government's dispatch of fascist police to massacre anti-U.S. demonstrators. After the rally ended, the patriotic crowd held a powerful demonstration in front of the Tachikawa Police Station. Holding signs that read "Protest the massacre," they chanted anti-U.S. slogans and fought back against the Japanese police who were suppressing them.

    日本人民连续示威反对美军新建野战医院
    示威群众不畏强暴同前来镇压的反动武装警察展开英勇搏斗
    据新华社九日讯　据东方通讯社报道：两千多名日本工人和学生八日夜里举行大会和示威游行，继续反对驻日美军在东京北区新建野战医院。
    美日反动势力对于日益高涨的日本人民的反美斗争非常害怕。佐藤反动政府出动了大批武装警察镇压反美运动。仅在早稻田大学一处，就有一千多名武装警察疯狂镇压准备前往参加大会的爱国学生。爱国学生同警察展开了搏斗，终于突破警察的重重包围，奔赴大会会场。
    工人和学生在排除了日本当局的种种阻挠后，按计划举行抗议大会，并且到美军兵营前进行了三小时的示威游行。法西斯警察对示威群众进行了野蛮镇压，并非法逮捕了二十多人。
    示威的工人和学生们举着写有“毛泽东思想万岁！”字样的红旗，举着各工会和学生会的旗帜，并且高呼“把美帝国主义从日本和亚洲赶出去！”“打倒佐藤政府！”等口号。工人和学生的反美示威受到了数以万计的市民的热情支持。
    另据东方通讯社报道：日本爱国工人、学生和市民一千六百人，二日傍晚在东京王子车站前举行集会，继续反对美军新建野战医院，并强烈抗议佐藤反动政府出动法西斯警察屠杀反美示威群众。集会结束以后，爱国群众到泷野川警察署门前举行了强大的示威。人们举着“抗议屠杀”的标语牌，高呼反美口号，并同镇压他们的日本警察展开了搏斗。
