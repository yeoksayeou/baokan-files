The Japan-China Friendship Association (Orthodox) Headquarters Enlarged Meeting Passes an Appeal
Crush the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and Develop the Japan-China Friendship Movement
The Meeting Unanimously Agrees to the Minutes of Talks Signed in Beijing by the Japan-China Friendship Association (Orthodox) Headquarters and the China-Japan Friendship Association

Xinhua News Agency, April 15th - According to a report from the Dongfang News Agency: On the 14th, the Japan-China Friendship Association (Orthodox) Headquarters held its third enlarged meeting of the board of directors in Tokyo. The meeting unanimously agreed to the minutes of the talks signed on April 10th in Beijing by representatives of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Orthodox) Headquarters, Miyazaki Seiken and Shimada Masao, and representatives of the China-Japan Friendship Association, Zhao Anbo and Wang Xiaoyun.

The enlarged meeting, based on the spirit of the minutes of the talks, passed an appeal titled "Crush the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty,' Overthrow the Sato Government, Fully Resolve the Japan-China Relationship, and Launch a National Movement to Restore Diplomatic Relations."

The appeal states: U.S. imperialism is attempting to turn Japan into its largest base for invading Vietnam, China, and Asia, and to drive the Japanese people to become cannon fodder for its aggressive wars. The reactionary Sato government, after issuing the Sato-Johnson talks communiqué, has become increasingly blatant in its anti-China stance, plotting to fully sabotage the Japan-China relationship, and frantically accelerating the revival of Japanese militarism.

The appeal points out that thoroughly crushing the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" is a fighting task for the peoples of Japan and China, and it is also the most urgent task for the current development of the Japan-China friendship movement.

In discussing the tasks of developing the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle, the appeal states: To oppose U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, the Japanese reactionaries, and the Japanese Communist Party's Miyamoto revisionist clique, and to isolate and strike the main enemy, U.S. imperialism, to the greatest extent, it is necessary to unite all possible anti-American forces and establish the broadest anti-American patriotic united front. This is the most urgent task for the Japanese people. The Japan-China friendship movement is an indispensable part of this anti-American patriotic united front.

The revolutionary people of Japan, who are bravely fighting against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and the Japanese Communist Party's Miyamoto revisionist clique, have boundless love for Chairman Mao, the great leader of the world's proletariat today. They draw fighting strength and confidence in victory from Chairman Mao's brilliant works.

    日中友协（正统）总部理事会扩大会议通过呼吁书
    粉碎日美“安全条约”发展日中友好运动
    会议一致同意日中友协（正统）总部和中日友协在北京签署的会谈纪要
    新华社十五日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日中友好协会（正统）总部十四日在东京召开第三次理事会扩大会议，会议一致表示同意四月十日在北京由日中友协（正统）总部代表宫崎世民、岛田政雄和中日友好协会代表赵安博、王晓云签署的会谈纪要。
    扩大会议根据会谈纪要的精神通过了一项“粉碎日美‘安全条约’、推翻佐藤政府、全面解决日中关系、掀起一个恢复日中邦交的国民运动”的呼吁书。
    呼吁书说：美帝国主义企图把日本变为它侵略越南、中国、亚洲的最大基地，并驱使日本人民充当它进行侵略战争的炮灰。佐藤反动政府在发表佐藤—约翰逊会谈公报之后，越来越露骨地进行反华，阴谋全面破坏日中关系，并疯狂地加速复活日本军国主义。
    呼吁书指出，彻底粉碎日美“安全条约”是日中两国人民的战斗任务，同时也是当前发展日中友好运动最迫切的任务。
    呼吁书在谈到发展日本人民反美爱国斗争的任务时指出：为了反对美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义、日本反动派和日共宫本修正主义集团，并把最主要的敌人美帝国主义最大限度地孤立起来，给予最大的打击，必须团结一切可以团结的反美力量，建立最广泛的反美爱国统一战线，这是日本人民最迫切的任务。日中友好运动是这个反美爱国统一战线不可分割的组成部分。（附图片）
    正在同美日反动派和日共宫本修正主义集团进行英勇斗争的日本革命人民，无限热爱当代世界无产阶级的伟大导师毛主席。他们从毛主席的光辉著作中，汲取战斗的力量和必胜的信心。
