The Tianjin Dry Battery Factory Revolutionary Committee, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, led the broad revolutionary masses of workers to smash the enemy's plot to overthrow the Revolutionary Committee, and the revolutionary production situation in the entire factory is excellent.

The People's Liberation Army Air Force propaganda team stationed at the Tianjin Dry Battery Factory enthusiastically helped the factory's Revolutionary Committee repeatedly study Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, strengthened the awareness of class struggle, saw through the surface calm of the factory after the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, and understood the essence of class struggle. They further intensified the class struggle, smashing the evil plots of the reactionary capitalists and other bad elements to sabotage the Revolutionary Committee time and time again, making the newly established Revolutionary Committee truly play the role of a command center for class struggle and production struggle.

In January of this year, soon after the establishment of the factory's Revolutionary Committee, some workers developed complacency and a sense of complacency. Some comrades thought that since the Revolutionary Committee had been established, the factory was calm, and the great task was accomplished. Some comrades even said that even if there were a few small ripples, they were just a few buzzing flies and did not need to be bothered. The thoughts of the workers aroused the high attention of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team.

After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, was the factory really calm? The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team and the factory Revolutionary Committee first studied the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle.

Chairman Mao said: "After the enemies with guns have been eliminated, the enemies without guns still exist, and they will inevitably fight to the death with us. We must not underestimate these enemies. If we do not put forward and understand the problem in this way now, we will make a great mistake." Chairman Mao's warm instructions made everyone realize that the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee signifies the brilliant victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; however, it does not mean the end of class struggle. The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team actively assisted the factory Revolutionary Committee in mobilizing the masses to thoroughly expose the crimes of the reactionary capitalists and a handful of bad elements within the factory who attempted to overthrow the newly established Revolutionary Committee. For example, some capitalists demanded "rehabilitation," some bad elements refused to participate in the activities organized by the Revolutionary Committee for various reasons, and some bad guys openly sowed discord among the leading members of the Revolutionary Committee. If not exposed, it was shocking. The workers said that after the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, the class enemies would definitely struggle desperately. The main reason we did not pay attention to these problems was that we forgot about class struggle.

After the broad revolutionary masses of workers strengthened their class struggle perspective, under the leadership of the factory Revolutionary Committee, they deeply exposed the sabotage activities of the class enemies. Once, a reactionary capitalist played tricks, attempting to paralyze the work of the Supply and Marketing Department, thereby disrupting the entire factory's production. The Revolutionary Committee promptly exposed this plot, revealing his true face in broad daylight, allowing him to behave properly and not to make trouble.

The factory Revolutionary Committee saw through the surface calm, recognized the essence of class struggle, and intensified the class struggle, making the entire factory present a great situation of seizing revolution and promoting production. The workers deeply felt that after the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, class struggle was not calm but more hidden and complex. We must remember Chairman Mao's instruction to "never forget class struggle" and continuously intensify the class struggle. In this way, the Revolutionary Committee can fully play the combat role of the command center for class struggle and production struggle.

    透过表面现象看到阶级斗争实质
    天津干电池厂革委会在解放军的帮助下，带领广大革命职工，粉碎了阶级敌人企图颠覆革委会的阴谋，全厂革命生产形势大好
  本报讯　人民解放军空军某部驻天津干电池厂毛泽东思想宣传队，满腔热情地帮助厂革命委员会反复学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导，增强阶级斗争观念，透过革委会成立后厂里风平浪静的表面现象，看到阶级斗争的实质，进一步狠抓阶级斗争，一次次粉碎了反动资本家及其他坏分子破坏革委会的罪恶阴谋，使新生的革委会真正发挥了阶级斗争、生产斗争指挥部的作用。
    今年一月，厂革命委员会成立不久，有些职工就产生了轻敌麻痹、万事大吉的思想。有的同志认为，革命委员会成立了，厂里风平浪静，大功告成了。有的同志甚至说，即使有点小的波纹，也不过是几只嗡嗡叫的苍蝇，不必管它。职工的这些活思想，引起了毛泽东思想宣传队的高度重视。
    革命委员会成立以后，是不是真的风平浪静了呢？毛泽东思想宣传队和厂革委会一起，首先学习了伟大统帅毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导。
    毛主席说：“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在，他们必然地要和我们作拚死的斗争，我们决不可以轻视这些敌人。如果我们现在不是这样地提出问题和认识问题，我们就要犯极大的错误。”毛主席的亲切教导使大家认识到：革委会的成立，标志着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的光辉胜利；但是，并不意味着阶级斗争的结束。毛泽东思想宣传队就主动协助厂革命委员会，放手发动群众，大摆厂内反动资本家和一小撮坏分子，企图颠覆新生的革命委员会的罪行。例如，有的资本家要求“平反”，有的坏分子以各种借口拒绝参加革委会组织的活动，有的坏家伙公开挑拨革委会领导成员之间的关系。不摆不知道，一摆吓一跳。职工们说，革委会成立以后，阶级敌人总要进行垂死的挣扎。我们所以不注意这些问题，主要原因是忘记了阶级斗争。
    广大革命职工阶级斗争的观点加强以后，在厂革命委员会的领导下，深入揭发阶级敌人的破坏活动。有一次，一个反动资本家玩弄阴谋，企图使供销科的工作陷于瘫痪，借以破坏全厂的生产。革委会及时地揭穿了这个阴谋，把他的本来面貌暴露在光天化日之下，只准他规规矩矩，不许乱说乱动。
    厂革委会透过表面的平静现象，认清阶级斗争实质，狠抓阶级斗争，使全厂出现了一派抓革命促生产的大好形势。职工们深深体会到，革委会成立以后，阶级斗争不是平静了，而是更隐蔽、更复杂了。我们要牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，不间断地狠抓阶级斗争。这样，革委会才能充分发挥阶级斗争、生产斗争指挥部的战斗作用。
