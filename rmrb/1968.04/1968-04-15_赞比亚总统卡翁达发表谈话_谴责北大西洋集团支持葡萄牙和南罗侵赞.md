Zambian President Kaunda on the 11th condemned the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Britain for supporting Portugal and Southern Rhodesia in their invasions of Zambia.

In a speech to reporters in Lusaka, he emphasized that the bombs dropped by Portuguese planes came from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Therefore, he said, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Zambia are in a state of "undeclared war."

Kaunda also condemned the recent flights by Southern Rhodesian racist colonialist planes over the Zambezi River, which dropped flares over Zambian territory to support ground troops fighting African guerrillas. He believed that the flares dropped by the invading Southern Rhodesian planes were made in Britain, and Britain must take responsibility for this.

To counter the invasions by Portuguese and Southern Rhodesian colonialists, Kaunda stated that he would mobilize the people to patrol the borders.

In his speech, Kaunda reaffirmed Zambia's stance of allowing exiled African nationalist organizations to establish offices in Zambia.

    谴责北大西洋集团支持葡萄牙和南罗侵赞
    赞比亚总统卡翁达十一日谴责北大西洋公约组织和英国支持葡萄牙和南罗得西亚对赞比亚的入侵。
    他在卢萨卡对记者发表谈话强调指出，葡萄牙飞机投掷的炸弹来自北大西洋公约组织，这样，北大西洋公约组织同赞比亚就处于“未宣布的战争状态”。
    卡翁达还谴责南罗得西亚种族主义殖民当局的飞机最近两次飞越赞比西河，在赞比亚境内投掷照明弹，以支援地面部队对非洲游击战士的作战。他认为，入侵的南罗得西亚飞机投掷的照明弹是英国制造的，英国必须对此承担责任。
    为了对付葡萄牙和南罗得西亚殖民主义的入侵，卡翁达表示将动员人民在边境巡逻。
    卡翁达在谈话中重申赞比亚允许流亡的非洲民族主义组织在赞比亚设立办事处的立场。
