In the face of the excellent situation where revolutionary committees are being established at various levels, the question confronting the "three supports, two militaries" personnel is: is the job done, or is there still a heavy responsibility ahead? Recently, some representatives attending the Tianjin City "three supports, two militaries" troops' conference on active learners of Chairman Mao's works held a discussion on this issue. Everyone unanimously agreed that after the establishment of the revolutionary committees, the question before us is not that the job is done, but that the responsibility is heavy. They are determined to further carry forward the spirit of thorough revolution, remain humble and modest, continue to strive, and carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end, continuously making new contributions to the people.

After the establishment of the revolutionary committees, is the task of the "three supports, two militaries" completed? The comrades participating in the discussion linked this issue to the situation in their own units supporting the left. Everyone unanimously agreed that the establishment of the revolutionary committees does not mean that the work of the "three supports, two militaries" is completed, but rather that "the first step of the long march has been taken." Everyone said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated by the great leader Chairman Mao, is a struggle to seize and consolidate power, and also a struggle to thoroughly criticize bourgeois ideology, establish Mao Zedong Thought, transform people's souls, and achieve the revolutionization of people's thinking. After more than a year of arduous struggle, we have seized the power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the party. However, the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line long advocated by Liu Shaoqi and his agents in various places has not been completely eliminated. The old habits and forces left over from the old society are still challenging us. The problem of solving people's worldview and uprooting the roots of revisionism still needs to be further addressed. After the establishment of the revolutionary committees, the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation in various units are still very arduous. If we relax our minds, the revolution may be half-hearted. The representatives believe that the reason why some comrades think that after the establishment of the revolutionary committees, the task of the "three supports, two militaries" is completed is mainly because they do not deeply understand the fundamental purpose of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated by Chairman Mao. We are the great proletarian revolutionary army personally created by the great leader Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin. It is our duty to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. The task given to us by Chairman Mao is far from completed, and we "must not relax our fighting will in the slightest." Chairman Mao teaches us: "It is better to pursue the enemy when they are weak, do not seek fame like King Xiang Yu." We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings, carry forward the spirit of thorough revolution, continue to strive, and do the work of the "three supports, two militaries" better.

Chairman Mao said: "All reactionary forces, when they are about to perish, will always make desperate struggles." The representatives attending the discussion said that the reason why some comrades have the idea of "mission accomplished" after the establishment of the revolutionary committees is mainly because they have a weak class struggle consciousness and do not fully understand the characteristics of class struggle in the new situation. Everyone said that with the establishment of the revolutionary committees, the power usurped by a handful of capitalist roaders within the party has been seized back by the proletariat. They will inevitably fight us with ten thousand times more ferocity. Tianjin Heavy Machinery Factory is a very typical example. After the establishment of the revolutionary committee in this factory, the class enemies in the factory used every means to spread rumors, sow discord between the military and the people, create contradictions among the members of the revolutionary committee, and use the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism among some of the masses to attack the newly born revolutionary committee. Linking these living examples, many comrades talked about how after the establishment of the revolutionary committees, class struggle is still very sharp and complex. We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "Do not be too naive to see the complex class struggle as too simple." Vice Chairman Lin teaches us: "Without a class standpoint, one cannot see the political situation clearly, cannot decide on policies, cannot correctly implement the policies decided by the Party Central Committee, cannot judge right from wrong, and cannot serve the people." The comrades attending the meeting deeply felt that Vice Chairman Lin's instructions hit the nail on the head of our thoughts. Everyone unanimously expressed that they must firmly establish a class struggle consciousness in their minds and never forget class struggle at any time. Only in this way can we maintain a strong fighting spirit, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The new social system has just been established and needs a period of consolidation. It cannot be assumed that the new system is completely consolidated once it is established. It needs to be gradually consolidated. To make it finally consolidated, ... it is still necessary to carry out constant and arduous socialist revolutionary struggles and socialist education on the political and ideological fronts." The representatives attending the discussion said that we not only have the responsibility to help establish revolutionary committees but also have the responsibility to help consolidate the new-born revolutionary power, especially to help the revolutionary committees do a good job in the revolutionization of thought and organization. This burden is still heavy. Many comrades talked about how after the establishment of the revolutionary committees, whether it is the revolutionary leading cadres who have joined or the leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations, there is still the issue of further achieving the revolutionization of thought. Helping the newly born revolutionary committees solve this problem is an important issue to ensure that the newly born revolutionary committees will never change color. We must, with a high sense of political responsibility, help them better study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, do a good job in the revolutionization of people's thought and organization; help them firmly walk the road of emphasizing proletarian politics, and learn to do painstaking ideological and political work. To achieve the revolutionization of the leading cadre, the most important thing is to "never forget class struggle," consciously temper oneself in the storms and waves of class struggle, and forge the newly born revolutionary committees into a strong fighting fortress that is good at leading the masses in class struggle.

The comrades attending the discussion finally unanimously expressed that they must firmly establish a class struggle consciousness, take "criticize selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the key, firmly grasp their own thought revolutionization, carry forward the spirit of thorough revolution, temper a red heart that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in the storms and waves of class struggle, and together with the newly born revolutionary committees, contribute all their strength to the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    帮助革命委员会在大风大浪中锻炼成长  发扬彻底革命精神不断地为人民立新功
    天津“三支”“两军”部队学习毛主席著作积极分子代表决心把文化大革命进行到底
    新华社天津五日电　在各级革命委员会纷纷建立起来的大好形势下，摆在“三支”“两军”人员面前的问题：是大功告成，还是任重道远？最近出席天津市
  “三支”“两军”部队学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的部分代表，就这一问题举行了座谈。大家一致认为，革命委员会成立后，摆在我们面前的问题，不是大功告成，而是任重道远。他们决心进一步发扬彻底革命精神，戒骄戒躁，再接再厉，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，不断为人民立新功。
    革命委员会建立后，“三支”“两军”任务是不是已经完成了呢？参加座谈的同志，联系自己支左单位的情况，畅谈了这个问题。大家一致认为，革委会的建立，不是“三支”“两军”工作已经完成了，“只是万里长征走完了第一步”。大家说，伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动的无产阶级文化大革命，是一场夺取政权、巩固政权的斗争，也是一场大破资产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想，改造人们灵魂，实现人的思想革命化的斗争。经过一年多的艰苦奋战，我们已经从组织上夺了党内一小撮走资派的权，但是，中国赫鲁晓夫及其在各地的代理人，长期推行的反革命修正主义路线的流毒，还没有完全肃清，旧社会遗留下来的旧习惯势力还在向我们挑战，解决人的世界观的问题，挖掉修正主义根子的问题，都有待于进一步解决。革委会建立后，各单位斗、批、改的任务，也还十分艰巨。如果我们从思想上松了气，革命就可能半途而废。代表们认为，我们有些同志之所以认为革委会成立后，“三支”“两军”任务就完成了，重要原因之一，就是对毛主席亲自发动的这场无产阶级文化大革命的根本目的理解不深。我们是伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造的、林副主席直接指挥的无产阶级革命军队，我们是国家政权的重要组成部分。把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，是我们责无旁贷的义务。毛主席交给我们的任务现在还远远没有完成，我们“绝对不可以稍微松懈自己的战斗意志。”毛主席教导我们：“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王”。我们一定要牢记毛主席的教导，发扬彻底革命精神，再接再厉，把“三支”“两军”工作做得更好。
    毛主席说：“一切反动势力在他们行将灭亡的时候，总是要进行垂死挣扎的。”参加座谈的代表谈到，我们有些同志在革命委员会成立后产生了“大功告成”的思想，最主要的原因是头脑里阶级斗争观念不强，对新形势下阶级斗争的特点认识不足。大家说，革命委员会的建立，党内一小撮走资派窃据的权力被无产阶级夺回来了，他们必然以千万倍的疯狂向我们进行拚死的斗争。天津市起重设备厂就是一个很典型的例子。这个厂革委会成立后，厂里的阶级敌人千方百计地制造谣言，挑拨军民关系，在革委会成员之间制造矛盾，利用一些群众中的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性攻击新生的革委会。联系这些活生生的事例，许多同志谈到，革命委员会建立以后，阶级斗争仍然十分尖锐复杂。我们必须牢记毛主席的教导：“切不可书生气十足，把复杂的阶级斗争看得太简单了”。林副主席教导我们：“没有阶级观点就不能看清政治形势，没有阶级观点就不能决定政策，没有阶级观点就不能正确执行党中央所决定的政策，没有阶级观点就不能判断是非，没有阶级观点就不能为人民服务。”到会的同志深刻地体会到，林副主席的这些指示，正打中了我们思想上的要害。大家一致表示，一定要从思想上牢牢地树立阶级斗争观念，无论什么时候，都要念念不忘阶级斗争。这样才能保持旺盛的斗志，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，才能紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“新的社会制度还刚刚建立，还需要有一个巩固的时间。不能认为新制度一旦建立起来就完全巩固了，那是不可能的。需要逐步地巩固。要使它最后巩固起来，……还必须在政治战线和思想战线上，进行经常的、艰苦的社会主义革命斗争和社会主义教育。”参加座谈的代表们谈到，我们不仅有责任帮助建立革命委员会，而且有责任帮助巩固新生的革命政权，特别是帮助革委会搞好思想革命化和组织革命化，这个担子还很重。许多同志谈到，革委会建立以后，无论是结合进来的革命领导干部或是革命群众组织的头头，都有一个进一步实现思想革命化的问题，帮助新生的革委会解决这个问题，是保证新生的革委会永不变色的重要问题。我们一定要以高度的政治责任感，帮助他们更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，搞好人的思想革命化和组织革命化；帮助他们坚定不移地走突出无产阶级政治的道路，学会做艰苦细致的思想政治工作。实现领导班子思想革命化，最重要的是要“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”，自觉地在阶级斗争的大风大浪中锻炼成长，把新生的革委会锻炼成为善于领导群众进行阶级斗争的坚强的战斗堡垒。
    参加座谈的同志最后一致表示，一定要牢固地树立阶级斗争观念，以“斗私，批修”为纲，狠抓自身思想革命化，发扬彻底革命的精神，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，锻炼一颗无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席革命路线的红心，同新生的革命委员会一起，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利贡献出自己的一切力量。
