In the context of the emergence of revolutionary committees, what should "Three Supports" and "Two Militaries" personnel focus on? The experience summarized by the "Three Supports" and "Two Militaries" personnel of the Zhangjiakou region's stationed troops at the conference on the exchange of experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's thoughts is: prioritize the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought, never forget class struggle, and together with the broad revolutionary masses, wield the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought to deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, never stopping the offensive against the class enemy, and thoroughly carry out the political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under socialist conditions.

Seizing class struggle is a crucial aspect of doing "Three Supports" and "Two Militaries" work well.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Never forget class struggle." In the situation where revolutionary committees at all levels are emerging like spring bamboo shoots, some comrades tasked with supporting the left have, due to insufficient understanding of the new situations and new problems in class struggle, thought that after nearly two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the handful of capitalist roaders within the party who have been overthrown are like frogs with broken legs and can't jump much, and even if there are a few small eels, they can't cause big waves. Therefore, they have developed a "relaxed" mentality, neglecting the sharp and complex class struggle. The "Three Supports" and "Two Militaries" personnel of the stationed troops in the Zhangjiakou region, in light of Chairman Mao's teaching "Do not be overly bookish and simplify the complex class struggle," reviewed the road they have traveled since participating in the "Three Supports" and "Two Militaries" work, deeply realizing that class struggle runs through the entire process of "Three Supports" and "Two Militaries" work. Seizing class struggle is a crucial aspect of doing "Three Supports" and "Two Militaries" work well. The idea that the establishment of revolutionary committees means "mission accomplished" and that a good situation means "peace and tranquility" and that one can "withdraw troops and return to camp" is wrong. Everyone realized that the establishment of revolutionary committees does not mean the end of class struggle. "This is only the first step of the long march of ten thousand miles." The class enemy will not resign themselves to defeat and will inevitably make a desperate struggle. Class struggle remains sharp and complex. If class struggle is not seized, it will deviate from the direction of the struggle and deviate from Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Only by helping revolutionary committees at all levels and the broad revolutionary masses to use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, to raise high the banner of revolutionary criticism, to seize class struggle, and to continuously launch offensives against the class enemy, can the newly established revolutionary committees be consolidated and proletarian revolutionary authority be established.

Many comrades have deeply felt that in the past, the reason why many units' leadership fell into the hands of a handful of capitalist roaders within the party was that they were poisoned by the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" of the Chinese Khrushchev, and their class struggle consciousness was weak, allowing the class enemy to exploit the gaps. After the establishment of revolutionary committees, the most important thing is to remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle"; among all tasks, the most important task is to arm the broad revolutionary masses with Mao Zedong Thought and help revolutionary committees at all levels to seize class struggle.

Recognize the new situation of class struggle and actively attack the class enemy.

Chairman Mao recently taught us: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under socialist conditions, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the broad revolutionary people under its leadership and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Everyone believes that Chairman Mao's latest instructions most profoundly explain that after the establishment of revolutionary committees, class struggle does not stop but, with the deepening development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, new situations and new problems have emerged. These new situations and new problems are mainly manifested in: the class enemy's struggle methods are more concealed and cunning, and their struggle tactics are more vicious and ruthless. This handful of class enemies, especially the traitors, spies, die-hard capitalist roaders within our party who have not been reformed, and the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries, they collude with each other and act in collusion. Some are using the complacency and arrogance of certain people in our revolutionary ranks in the face of victory, using the "sugar-coated bullets" of the bourgeoisie to bribe and flatter the members of the revolutionary committee; some are using the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism in people's minds to sow discord and create divisions; some are still fanning the flames and setting fires, damaging military-civilian relations, attempting to weaken the dictatorship of the proletariat; some are changing their appearance and disguising themselves, infiltrating the revolutionary ranks; some are using the opposition to the "ultra-left" trend to spread the rightist reversal wind, negating the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and negating the revolutionary mass movement; some are hypocritical, having one face in public and another in private, engaging in extensive counter-revolutionary two-faced activities.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Counter-revolutionaries who appear in disguise conceal their true nature and show a false appearance." Everyone believes that in the face of the reality of class struggle, "Three Supports" and "Two Militaries" personnel must keep their eyes open and maintain a clear mind at all times, helping the revolutionary masses to analyze the enemy's movements and guiding them to engage in a head-on struggle with the class enemy. Everyone agrees that in the new situation of class struggle, to guide the broad revolutionary masses to engage in a head-on struggle with the class enemy, the following key links must be seized: (1) Class struggle education must be conducted frequently and timely for the broad revolutionary masses to enhance their class struggle consciousness. (2) Revolutionary criticism must be carried out deeply and persistently, closely linked with the current class struggle reality, and linked with the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit, step by step to expose and criticize the heinous crimes of the handful of capitalist roaders within the party led by the Chinese Khrushchev and their agents in the region and unit; thoroughly expose the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie; strongly criticize the rightist reversal wind. (3) Mobilize the masses to launch continuous offensives against all class enemies. Thoroughly expose and resolutely strike all destructive activities of a handful of traitors, spies, die-hard capitalist roaders, and unreformed landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, as well as the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries.

The more complex the class struggle, the more thorough the struggle against selfishness and the establishment of public spirit.

Everyone believes that while helping revolutionary committees at all levels and the broad revolutionary masses to seize class struggle, "Three Supports" and "Two Militaries" personnel must also seize the class struggle in their own minds, thoroughly eliminate selfishness and establish public spirit, and carry out ideological revolutionization. The struggle between "public" and "private" is class struggle, a reflection in our minds of the struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads. The more acute and complex the class struggle, the more profound and intense the struggle between "public" and "private." The more fiercely we struggle against "private," the clearer our minds and the more definite our direction. The more thoroughly we struggle against "private," the more firmly we establish class struggle consciousness.

In the current situation where revolutionary committees are emerging across the country and the revolutionary situation is generally good, the "private" in the minds of "Three Supports" and "Two Militaries" personnel is mainly: some people are complacent and overconfident; only see achievements and are blindly self-satisfied. Many comrades say that if we become complacent, we will rest on our laurels and let the class enemy exploit the gaps; if we become arrogant, we will be high above the masses, detached from the people, and hit by the class enemy's "sugar-coated bullets"; if we relax, we will stop moving forward, become rightist conservative, and suffer a sudden attack from the class enemy.

Everyone believes that we must take real class struggle as a living textbook, take the great mass movement of struggle against the enemy as the best classroom, consciously link our thoughts, study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, and raise our class struggle consciousness and line struggle consciousness. Only in this way can we follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, never stop launching offensives against the class enemy, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    在革命委员会联翩出现的情况下“三支”“两军”人员应该抓什么？
    牢记毛主席的教导念念不忘阶级斗争
    高举革命批判大旗不停地向敌人进攻
    张家口地区驻军支左人员认真总结经验，决心做好“三支”“两军”工作，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利
    本报讯　三结合的革命委员会纷纷建立以后，“三支”“两军”工作应该抓什么？张家口地区驻军“三支”“两军”人员活学活用毛泽东思想经验交流大会总结的经验是：把活学活用毛泽东思想放在首位，念念不忘阶级斗争，和广大革命群众一起，奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，深入开展革命大批判，一刻也不停顿地主动向阶级敌人进攻，把在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命进行到底。
        狠抓阶级斗争，是搞好
    “三支”“两军”工作的重要一环
    毛主席教导我们：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”。在各级革命委员会如雨后春笋般出现的大好形势下，有些担任支左任务的同志，由于对阶级斗争的新情况、新问题认识不足。认为经过近二年的无产阶级文化大革命，党内一小撮被打倒了的走资派，象断了腿的蛤蟆，没多大蹦跶头了，即使有几条小泥鳅，也翻不起大浪来，因而产生了“松口气”的思想，忽视了尖锐复杂的阶级斗争。张家口地区驻军“三支”“两军”人员对照毛主席“切不可书生气十足，把复杂的阶级斗争看得太简单了”的教导，回顾参加“三支”“两军”工作以来所走过的道路，深深体会到：阶级斗争贯穿于“三支”“两军”工作的始终，狠抓阶级斗争是搞好“三支”“两军”工作的重要一环。那种认为革命委员会成立就是“大功告成”，形势大好就是“天下太平”，可以“收兵回营”的想法是错误的。大家认识到，革命委员会成立了，阶级斗争并没有结束，“这只是万里长征走完了第一步”。阶级敌人并不甘心于他们的失败，他们必然的要作垂死的挣扎。阶级斗争仍然十分尖锐复杂。如果不抓阶级斗争，就会背离斗争大方向，背离毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。只有帮助各级革命委员会和广大革命群众，以毛泽东思想为武器，高举革命批判大旗，狠抓阶级斗争，不断向阶级敌人主动进攻，才能巩固新生的革命委员会，建立起无产阶级革命权威。
    许多同志深有体会地说，过去许多单位的印把子之所以落到党内一小撮走资派手里，就是由于中了中国赫鲁晓夫“阶级斗争熄灭”论的毒，阶级斗争观念淡薄了，被阶级敌人钻了空子。革命委员会成立之后，千重要，万重要，牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导最重要；千件事，万件事，用毛泽东思想武装广大革命群众，帮助各级革命委员会狠抓阶级斗争是头等大事。
        认清阶级斗争的新情况，
      主动地向阶级敌人进攻
    毛主席最近教导我们：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”大家认为，毛主席的最新指示最深刻地说明革命委员会成立后，阶级斗争不是停止了，而是随着无产阶级文化大革命的深入发展，出现了新情况、新问题。这种新情况、新问题集中表现在：阶级敌人的斗争方式更加隐蔽狡猾，斗争手段更加阴险毒辣。这一小撮阶级敌人，特别是混进我们党里的那些叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派和没有改造好的地富反坏右及国民党反动派残渣余孽，他们互相勾结，狼狈为奸。他们有的正利用我们革命队伍里的某些人在胜利面前产生的麻痹、骄傲情绪，用金钱收买、阿谀奉承的资产阶级“糖衣炮弹”，腐蚀革委会成员；有的利用人们头脑中的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，挑拨离间，制造分裂；有的仍在煽阴风，点鬼火，破坏军民关系，企图削弱无产阶级专政；有的改头换面，乔装打扮，钻进革命队伍；有的利用反对极“左”思潮，大刮右倾翻案风，否定无产阶级文化大革命，否定革命群众运动；有的阴一面，阳一面，当面一套，背后一套，大搞反革命两面派活动。
    毛主席教导我们：“以伪装出现的反革命分子，他们给人以假象，而将真象荫蔽着。”大家认为，面对阶级斗争现实，“三支”“两军”人员必须擦亮眼睛，时刻保持清醒头脑，帮助革命群众分析敌人的动向，引导他们同阶级敌人进行针锋相对的斗争。大家一致认为，在阶级斗争的新情况下，要引导广大革命群众同阶级敌人进行针锋相对的斗争，必须抓住以下几个主要环节：（一）要经常及时地对广大革命群众进行阶级斗争教育，增强他们的阶级斗争观念。（二）要把革命的大批判深入持久地开展下去，紧密结合当前阶级斗争的实际，结合本单位的斗批改，步步深入地揭露和批判以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派及其在本地区本单位代理人的滔天罪行；充分揭露资产阶级反动路线；有力地批判右倾翻案风。（三）要放手发动群众，不停顿地向一切阶级敌人主动发起进攻。充分揭露和坚决打击一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派及没有改造好的地富反坏右分子和国民党反动派残渣余孽的一切破坏活动。
  阶级斗争越是复杂，破私立公越要彻底
    大家认为，“三支”“两军”人员在帮助各级革命委员会和广大革命群众狠抓阶级斗争的同时，要抓好自己头脑里的阶级斗争，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，搞好思想革命化。“公”与“私”的斗争，就是阶级斗争，就是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争在我们头脑里的反映。阶级斗争越尖锐、越复杂，“公”与“私”的斗争就越深入、越激烈。对“私”字斗得越狠，头脑越清醒，方向越明确。对“私”字斗得越彻底，阶级斗争观念就树得越牢固。
    在当前全国各地革命委员会联翩出现，革命形势一片大好的情况下，“三支”“两军”人员头脑中的“私”字概括起来主要是：有些人居安思稳，轻敌麻痹；只看成绩，盲目自满。许多同志说，如果我们一麻痹，就会高枕无忧，让阶级敌人钻了空子；如果我们一骄傲，就会高高在上，脱离群众，被阶级敌人的“糖衣炮弹”击中；如果我们一松劲，就会停止不前，右倾保守，遭到阶级敌人的突然袭击。
    大家认为，必须把现实的阶级斗争当作活教材，把对敌斗争的伟大群众运动当作最好的课堂，自觉地联系自己的思想，活学活用毛泽东思想，提高阶级斗争觉悟和路线斗争觉悟。只有这样，才能紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署，一刻不停地向阶级敌人主动进攻，取得无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
