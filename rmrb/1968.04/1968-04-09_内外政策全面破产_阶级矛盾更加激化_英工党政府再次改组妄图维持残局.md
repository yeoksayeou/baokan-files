According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in London on April 6, British Prime Minister Wilson announced another government reshuffle on the evening of April 5. This is the third and largest reshuffle of the Labour government since the pound was devalued in November last year. This reshuffle was carried out in a situation where the Labour government's domestic and foreign policies have completely failed, class contradictions have sharpened, and the ruling class is in a state of chaos. It once again exposed the desperate plight of Wilson's government, which serves as a tool of British monopoly capital.

Wilson carried out this government reshuffle to strengthen his own power and continue to struggle amidst numerous difficulties. This reshuffle involved sixteen ministers, but mainly promoted Castle, the former Minister of Transport, who is close to Wilson, and Crossman, the Labour Party leader in the House of Commons. Castle was promoted to First Secretary and Minister of Employment and Productivity, specifically responsible for implementing the Labour government's policy of increasing the exploitation of the people's wages and prices, and also took over the responsibilities of the former Minister of Labour, using both soft and hard methods to deal with workers demanding wage increases. Crossman, on the other hand, oversees the departments of Health, Housing, Education, and Social Insurance, tightening the Labour government's austerity measures in these areas.

Since the Labour government came to power, it has been working hard to serve British monopoly capital, pursuing American aggression policies abroad and intensifying the exploitation of the people at home. However, under the impact of the revolutionary storm of the people of the world, the Labour government's domestic and foreign policies have suffered repeated serious setbacks; and the capitalist world's currency and financial crisis that erupted after the devaluation of the pound has put Britain's weak finances and economy on the brink of collapse. In order to save British imperialism from its plight, the Labour government recently adopted a series of measures, including the "crisis budget" announced in mid-March, which even more frantically plundered the laboring people. This has further provoked the British people to condemn the Labour government's economic policies and continuously launch struggles to demand wage increases. In the four by-elections held on March 28, the Labour Party suffered a heavy defeat, with votes obtained being almost half of what they were in the 1966 "general election." These circumstances have caused panic within the British ruling class, especially within the Labour Party; the infighting and power struggles within the government have also intensified. The resignation of Finance Minister Callaghan after the pound's devaluation and the resignation of Foreign Minister Brown during the unprecedented gold-buying frenzy in the capitalist world in March are both manifestations of the intensifying internal struggles within the Labour government in the face of difficulties and failures. The current government reshuffle is also a result of this.

All these circumstances indicate that the Wilson government is increasingly mired in an inescapable predicament. In the face of the accelerating decline of the decrepit British imperialism, no matter how the Labour government struggles, it is all in vain.

    内外政策全面破产　阶级矛盾更加激化
    英工党政府再次改组妄图维持残局
    据新华社伦敦六日电　英国首相威尔逊在五日晚上宣布又一次改组政府。这是去年十一月英镑被迫贬值以来第三次也是最大的一次工党政府班子的变动。这次改组是在工党政府内政、外交政策全面破产、国内阶级矛盾更加激化、统治集团内部吵作一团的情况下进行的，再一次暴露了作为英国垄断资本工具的威尔逊政府走投无路的窘迫处境。
    威尔逊进行这次政府改组，是为了加强自己的势力，在重重困难中继续进行挣扎。这次改组牵涉到十六个大臣，但主要是提升了同威尔逊关系密切的原运输大臣卡斯尔和下院工党头目克罗斯曼。卡斯尔升任第一大臣兼就业和生产率大臣，专门负责推行工党政府加强剥削人民的工资和物价政策，并且接管原劳工大臣的职责，用软硬兼施的手法去对付要求提高工资的工人。克罗斯曼则统管卫生、住房、教育和社会保险各部，为工党政府在这些方面加紧向人民开刀。
    工党政府上台以来，拚命为英国垄断资本效劳，对外竭力追随美国的侵略政策，对内加紧压榨人民。但是，在世界人民革命风暴的打击下，工党政府的内外政策一再遭到严重的失败；而英镑贬值后爆发的资本主义世界货币金融危机，又使英国虚弱的财政经济有崩溃的危险。为了挽救英帝国主义的厄运，工党政府最近又采取了一系列措施，包括在三月中旬公布的“危机预算”，更加疯狂地向劳动人民横征暴敛。这就越发激起英国人民纷纷谴责工党政府的经济政策、为提高工资而不断掀起斗争浪潮。在三月二十八日举行的四次议员“补缺选举”中，工党全部遭到惨重失败，所得选票比一九六六年“大选”时减少了差不多一半。这些情况，在英国统治集团特别是工党内，引起了惊慌；政府内部互相诿过和争权夺利的斗争，也越演越烈。英镑贬值后财政大臣卡拉汉的辞职和三月间资本主义世界空前的黄金抢购风暴中外交大臣布朗的辞职，都是工党政府在困难、失败面前内部斗争白热化的表现。目前这次政府改组也是这样。
    这一切情况表明，威尔逊政府已经越来越深陷在无法摆脱的困境之中。在老朽的英帝国主义加速沉沦的情况下，无论工党政府怎样挣扎，都是徒劳的。
