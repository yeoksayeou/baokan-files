In January of this year, the Revolutionary Committee of the Cotton Textile Mill in Tonghua City, Jilin Province, was established. The revolutionary workers of the entire factory have great hopes for the newly formed Revolutionary Committee and for their representatives, hoping that they will never detach themselves from the masses.

Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "The most fundamental aspect of reforming state organs is to connect with the masses." How can the members of the Revolutionary Committee represent the masses? They have learned from practice that to represent the masses, one must first closely connect with the masses.

"How can representatives of the masses truly represent the masses?" This was a question faced by the Cotton Textile Mill Revolutionary Committee after its establishment. The military propaganda team stationed at the mill and the committee members, with this question in mind, studied Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao taught us: "All correct leadership must come from the masses and go to the masses." "We have always advocated that the revolution relies on the people, that everyone should participate, and we oppose relying only on a few people to issue orders." Comparing Mao's instructions, the committee members seriously examined their own understanding of the masses. After repeated study and discussion, everyone realized: "The masses are the true heroes." Only by first being a student of the masses can one have the qualification to be their teacher; only by forever rooting oneself among the masses and maintaining close contact with them can one forever represent the masses and be a true representative of the masses. Deputy Director Liu Yuangui said: The fact that everyone elected us as representatives only shows that we have gained the trust of the masses in the past. Whether we can truly represent the masses in the future depends on our actions.

Through study, their understanding was elevated, and they were able to handle practical issues better according to Chairman Mao's instructions. For a period, the factory was affected by anarchist tendencies, which impacted the revolution and production. Faced with this situation, there were two opinions among the committee members: one advocated establishing a few regulations to suppress the chaos; the other advocated starting from ideological education and mobilizing the masses to educate themselves. Which opinion was correct? The masses gave them a clear answer. The workers said that establishing some regulations is necessary. However, ideological issues cannot be "controlled" by regulations, nor can they be "suppressed" by orders. To solve this problem, one must rely on Mao Zedong Thought and achieve the transformation of people's ideology. Some workers said: As long as we run Mao Zedong Thought study classes well, many problems can be solved. Based on the workers' opinions, the factory Revolutionary Committee opened Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The workers, armed with Chairman Mao's latest instructions, fiercely criticized the fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev, and in the great criticism, the revolutionary workers raised their awareness of class struggle and line struggle. As a result, the entire factory saw a flourishing scene of revolution and production.

After this learning from the masses, whenever they encountered major issues, they would hold meetings with the workers to decide on the course of action. They would invite the masses to be their teachers and the committee members to be their students, patiently listening to the masses' opinions, humbly learning from the masses, and implementing the masses' opinions. The committee members deeply felt that the masses understood Chairman Mao's revolutionary line the deepest and followed Chairman Mao's strategic deployments the closest. Believing in the masses and relying on the masses, the Revolutionary Committee could always represent the interests of the masses and serve the people wholeheartedly.

Does working alongside the workers all day, with sweat flowing together, count as closely connecting with the masses? Their experience was: working with the workers is only the beginning of closely connecting with the masses; to truly achieve close connection with the masses, one must:

Be sincere in exchanging hearts with the workers, and the workers will be close to you.

Director Xu Guijun worked with the workers for a day changing bobbins, and was so tired that his waist and legs ached. Someone even secretly commented that this was "window dressing." Deputy Director Liu Hongxiang went to the weaving workshop to work, and originally the workers were chatting enthusiastically, but as soon as he entered, it became "cold." Why was this? The committee members were most affected by Deputy Director Liu Yuangui's three visits to the weaving workshop. Liu Yuangui was a warping worker, and during the Cultural Revolution, he was elected as the leader of a mass organization, and later was elected into the factory Revolutionary Committee. After Liu Yuangui was elected into the Revolutionary Committee, he wanted to follow Chairman Mao's instructions and forever root himself among the masses. However, when he first went to the workshop, he felt unnatural. Because most of the workers here were originally from the "opposing" organization. Today, he came here to work, and he had secretly reminded himself: Now I am the deputy director of the Revolutionary Committee, no matter what, I must humbly listen, whether the words are salty or bland. Therefore, as soon as he entered the workshop, he actively started talking to the workers, asking how to operate the machine and how to change the shuttle. But after asking a few times, the workers responded indifferently. In this way, he worked in the weaving workshop for a day doing "mute work."

That night, Liu Yuangui lay on the kang, tossing and turning, unable to sleep. The scenes from the day kept appearing before his eyes. But he did not blame the workers; instead, he looked for the problem within himself. Finally, he felt that the root of the problem was that he had not put down his airs. The next day, as soon as he started work, he acted like a new apprentice, fetching small bobbins when he saw that the weaving machine had few small bobbins, and quickly threading the line when he saw that the thread had broken. In this way, Liu Yuangui thought that this time he could resolve the issue. Unexpectedly, the workers still treated him as an "outsider." What was the root of the problem? Liu Yuangui was really troubled.

The problem that Liu Yuangui encountered was something that many committee members had not been able to solve. After the establishment of the factory Revolutionary Committee, new cadres decided not to leave the workshop and not to take off their work clothes, forever maintaining the appearance of laborers; old cadres learned from past lessons, put on work clothes, and entered the workshop to work diligently. However, why did some masses still not welcome them after they worked like this? This had become an unsolvable "mystery."

The military propaganda team stationed at the factory saw these situations and suggested that the committee members sit down and study Chairman Mao's works with this question in mind. Chairman Mao said: "Now, some people go to factories and rural areas, and the results are that some have gains, while others have none. This involves a question of stance or attitude, that is, a question of worldview." Chairman Mao's words were like a guiding light, and this "mystery" was solved. The committee members deeply felt that they had only brought their bodies to the masses, but their thoughts had not met the masses. In this way, without thoroughly transforming their worldview, no matter how much sweat they poured, their hearts would still not be close to the masses. To closely connect with the masses, one must expose their thoughts to the masses, exchange hearts with the masses, and only then can one truly achieve a close connection with the masses. Liu Yuangui's feelings were even deeper. He thought that to make himself a confidant of the masses, he must open his heart to the masses. In the past, my attitude towards the masses of the "opposing" organization was not good, and now how do I understand it? The masses do not know the bottom of it, and if I do not expose my "privacy," the masses will not trust me. Therefore, he actively went to the workshop to expose his thoughts, completely revealing his past. Not only did he expose the shortcomings and errors that others saw, but he also exposed the private thoughts that others did not see. To obtain more help from the masses, he also wrote his shortcomings on a big-character poster and exposed them to all the workers in the factory. Liu Yuangui's revolutionary action of exposing his privacy without fear of ugliness and fighting his privacy without fear of pain was seen by the workers and delighted their hearts. Afterwards, when he went to the workshop to work, they included Liu Yuangui in their team from the heart.

Liu Yuangui did this, and other committee members also went to the workshop, placing their bodies among the masses and exposing their thoughts to the masses. In this way, the workers understood the cadres from their thoughts and treated them as confidants, and they were willing to share their heartfelt words with them.

Is it not good enough to humbly learn from the masses and sincerely exchange hearts with the masses? They said: No! One must also:

Open one's ears to listen to different opinions and continuously correct the shortcomings in one's work.

Just as the comrades of the Cotton Textile Mill Revolutionary Committee were galloping forward, a cannonball flew from the logistics group: "What kind of Revolutionary Committee is this! The old regulations and systems are still stifling people!" This sudden attack had a great impact on the Revolutionary Committee. Most people thought: This shot was well aimed and was the concern and love of the revolutionary workers for the Revolutionary Committee. However, some people did not understand. They felt that this was giving the Revolutionary Committee a hard time and pouring cold water on it. Some people also had a sense of grievance, thinking that the Revolutionary Committee was a new thing, and even if it made some mistakes, it was not a big deal. To constantly criticize, how could they work in the future?

Regarding the masses' criticism, especially sharp criticism, what attitude should be taken? This is a major issue of adhering to what line. For this reason, the military propaganda team stationed at the factory suggested that they go to the masses to conduct investigations and receive education.

The masses' supervision was like a mirror, reflecting the shortcomings in the Revolutionary Committee's work. They saw with their own eyes the harm caused by overlapping organizations and complicated procedures, and recognized that the masses' opinions were correct. On one hand, they checked with the comrades who raised the opinions, and on the other hand, the Revolutionary Committee also conducted a special study, resolutely breaking down overlapping organizations, and simplifying the approval procedures, changing the "multi-element" leadership to "one-element" leadership.

At this point, the matter should have been over. However, the propaganda team comrades seized this opportunity and, together with the committee members, studied Chairman Mao's works. Using Chairman Mao's instructions on the mass line as a weapon, they discussed how to strengthen the mass line with the topic "Why can't we accept the masses' sharp criticism?" The committee director, Xu Guijun, said with deep feelings: Why do I always feel uncomfortable when I hear the masses' sharp criticism? It is because I think of myself as a "leader," and the "I" in my mind drives out the "masses," and when the criticism is a bit fierce, I think it is against me. In fact, this is a worldview issue, an issue of whether to believe in the masses or believe in oneself, and it is a reflection of the struggle between the two lines in one's mind. Some comrades also said: Chairman Mao repeatedly instructed us to believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and respect the masses' pioneering spirit. If we can't even accept the masses' slightly sharp criticism, how can we talk about believing in the masses?

Through study, the committee members understood a truth: The Revolutionary Committee has been established, but it does not necessarily mean that proletarian thought is in charge. Old habits and forces, bourgeois thought, will still corrupt us through various channels. To truly achieve what Chairman Mao pointed out, "a revolutionary and mass-connected leadership collective," we must seriously listen to the masses' criticism, continuously correct the shortcomings and errors in our thoughts and work, and only then can we forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Now, the Cotton Textile Mill in Tonghua City presents a lively scene, with a thriving revolution and booming production. The broad revolutionary masses are, with class struggle as the key link, deeply and persistently carrying out the great criticism of the revolution, making the proletarian cultural revolution in this factory better and better!

    革命委员会成员怎样才能真正代表群众？
    密切联系群众  把心交给群众
    吉林省通化市棉织厂革委会成员遵照毛主席教导，扎根于群众，取得很好的经验
    今年一月，吉林省通化市棉织厂革命委员会成立。全厂革命职工，对新生的革命委员会，对自己选出来的代表，寄予无限的希望，希望他们永远不脱离群众。
    毛主席最近教导我们：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”革命委员会的成员怎样做才能代表群众呢？他们从实践中体会到：要代表群众首先必须密切联系群众
      “群众代表怎样做才能代表群众？”这是棉织厂革委会成立后，碰到的一个问题。驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队和革委会成员，带着这个问题学习毛主席著作。毛主席教导我们：“凡属正确的领导，必须是从群众中来，到群众中去。”“我们历来主张革命要依靠人民群众，大家动手，反对只依靠少数人发号施令。”对照毛主席的指示，革委会的成员认真地检查了自己的群众观念。经过反复学习讨论，大家认识到：“群众是真正的英雄”。只有先当群众的学生，才有资格做群众的先生；只有永远扎根在群众之中，永远保持同群众的密切联系，才能永远代表群众，才配作真正的群众代表。革委会副主任刘元吉说：大伙选我们当代表，这只能说明过去我们得到了群众的信任。以后能不能真正代表群众，还要看行动。
    通过学习，使他们提高了认识，处理起实际问题来，也就能更好地按毛主席的指示办事了。有一段时间，厂里由于无政府主义思潮的干扰，影响了革命和生产。面对这种情况，革委会的成员中有两种意见：一种是主张定几条制度压一压；一种主张从思想教育入手，发动群众自己教育自己。两种意见那种正确呢？群众给了他们明确的回答。工人们说，规定一些制度是必要的。但是思想问题制度“卡”不住，命令“压”不倒，要解决这个问题，就得靠毛泽东思想，靠实现人的思想革命化。有的工人说：只要办好毛泽东思想学习班，许多问题都能解决。根据工人们的意见，厂革委会开办了毛泽东思想学习班。工人们以毛主席的最新指示为武器，狠揭狠批中国赫鲁晓夫散布的修正主义谬论，在大批判中，革命职工提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟，结果全厂革命和生产出现了一片欣欣向荣的景象。
    经过这次群众路线的学习以后，每当遇到重大问题，他们就请工人开会拿主意。请群众当先生，委员当学生，耐心地听取群众的意见，虚心地向群众学习，把群众的意见集中起来，再贯彻下去，与群众一道认真执行。革委会成员深深体会到，群众对毛主席的革命路线理解得最深，对毛主席的战略部署跟得最紧。相信群众，依靠群众，革委会就能够时刻代表群众的利益，全心全意为人民服务。
    整天和工人劳动在一起，汗水流在一起，这算不算密切联系群众？他们的体会是：和工人一起劳动，仅仅是密切联系群众的开始；要真正做到密切联系群众，必须是：
    跟工人真诚交心　工人才能和你贴心
    革委会主任徐贵全同工人一起换了一天纱轴，累得腰酸腿疼，有人却背地议论这是“装潢门面”。副主任刘洪祥到织布车间劳动，原先工人们唠得挺热火，可他一进来就“冷场”了。这是为什么？革委会成员触动最大的还是副主任刘元吉三下织布车间的那件事。刘元吉是整经工人，在文化大革命运动中，被选为群众组织的负责人，后来又被选进厂革命委员会。刘元吉选进革命委员会以后，就想按照毛主席的教导，永远扎根于群众之中。可是，当他第一次到车间的时候，心里很不自然。因为这里的工人，过去多数是“对立面”组织的。今天他到这里来劳动，事先曾暗暗地提醒自己：现在我是革委会副主任，无论如何也不能象过去那样对待阶级兄弟，不管说咸道淡，都要虚心地听。因此，他一进车间就主动地和工人们搭话，问机器怎样操作，怎样换梭子。可他问了几遍，人家都爱答不理的。就这样，他在织布车间干了一天“哑吧活”。
    晚上，刘元吉躺在炕上，翻来复去睡不着，白天的情景又浮现在眼前。但他没有责怪工人，而是从主观上找原因。最后他觉得病根在于自己没有放下架子。第二天一上班，他就象刚入厂的学徒工，看织布机上小穗不多了，就跑去搬小穗；看线断头了，就赶快去接线。就这样，刘元吉满以为这回可以把疙瘩解开了。没想到工人们还是把他当“外人”。病根到底在哪里？可把刘元吉难坏了。
    刘元吉碰到的难题，不少委员也一直没有找到答案。厂革委会成立以后，新干部决心不离开车间，不脱掉工作服，永远保持劳动人民的本色；老干部吸取过去的教训，穿上工作服，走进车间，实打实凿地干活。可是，他们这样干了，有些群众为什么对他们还不热情呢？这简直成了猜不透的“谜”。
    驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队看到这些情况，便建议革委会委员坐下来，带着这个问题学习毛主席著作。毛主席说：“现在也有一些人到工厂农村去，结果是有的有收获，有的就没有收获。这中间有一个立场问题或者态度问题，也就是世界观的问题。”毛主席的话，是指路明灯，这个“谜”解开了，革委会委员们深深感到，他们到车间参加劳动，只是身子到了群众中间，思想还没和群众见面。这样，不彻底改造世界观，汗水流得再多，心仍然和群众贴不到一起。要密切联系群众，就得把思想亮给群众，向群众交心，才能真正做到和群众心贴心。刘元吉的感受更深，他想，要使自己成为群众的知心人，就必须把心掏给群众。过去我对“对立面”组织的群众态度不好，现在认识得怎么样，群众不摸底，不把“私”亮出来，群众就不会信任。于是，他就主动地到车间亮思想，把过去的老底全抖落出来。不仅检查别人看到的缺点和错误，还亮了别人看不见的私心。为了得到更多的群众帮助，他还把自己的缺点写成大字报向全厂职工亮。刘元吉这种亮私不怕丑，斗私不怕疼的革命行动，工人们看在眼里，喜在心上。以后再去车间劳动，他们就从思想上把刘元吉编入了自己的队伍。
    刘元吉是这样做的，其他委员也下到车间，把身子置于群众之中，把思想亮给群众。这样，工人从思想上了解了干部，把他们当成了知心人，有什么心里话也就愿意掏给他们了。　
    既虚心地向群众学习，又做到了跟群众真诚交心，这该算不错了吧！他们说：不行！还必须做到：
    敞开耳朵听取不同意见  不断改正工作中的缺点
    正当棉织厂革委会的同志扬鞭跃马，阔步前进的时候，却从后勤组迎头飞来了一炮：“这叫什么革委会！旧规章制度还在层层卡人！”
    这劈头盖脑的一炮，对革委会震动很大。多数人认为：这一炮轰得好，是革命职工对革委会的关心和爱护。但是，有的人想不通。他们觉得这是给革委会出难题、泼冷水。有的人则有委屈情绪，认为革委会是个新生事物，就是出点漏子也没啥了不起的。动不动就来一炮，以后还怎么工作？
    对于群众的批评，特别是尖锐的批评，抱什么态度，这是坚持什么路线的大问题。为此，驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队，又针对革委会对待群众意见的不同态度，建议他们到群众中去做调查，受教育。
    群众的监督象一面镜子，照出了革委会工作中的缺点。他们亲眼看到机构重叠、手续繁杂的害处，认识到群众的意见提得正确。一方面向提意见的同志作了检查，另方面革委会还专门作了研究，坚决打破重叠的机构，并简化了审批手续，把“多元化”领导改为“一元化”领导。
    到了这里，事情本来就结束了。可是宣传队的同志却抓住这件事，同革委会的成员一起学习毛主席著作。以毛主席关于群众路线的教导为武器，以“为啥听不进群众尖锐的批评”为题，进行了一场如何加强群众观念的讨论。革委会主任徐贵全深有感触地说：我听到群众尖锐的批评为啥总是不舒服呢？就是因为觉得自己是个“领导”，脑子里的“我”字挤跑了“群众”，意见过点火，就认为是跟自己过不去。实际上这是世界观问题，是相信群众还是相信自己的问题，是两条路线斗争在自己头脑中的反映。有的同志也说：毛主席一再教导我们要相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神，咱连群众稍为尖锐一点的批评都听不进去，那里还谈得上相信群众呢？
    通过学习，委员们学通了一条道理：革命委员会建立起来了，不一定就完全是无产阶级思想当家，旧的习惯势力，资产阶级思想，还会通过各条渠道来腐蚀我们，要真正做到毛主席指出的“一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”，就应该认真听取群众的批评，不断改正思想上和工作中的缺点错误，才能永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    现在，通化市棉织厂出现了一派生气勃勃的局面，革命轰轰烈烈，生产热气腾腾。广大革命群众正在以阶级斗争为纲，深入地持久地开展革命的大批判，把这个厂的无产阶级文化大革命搞得好上加好！
