This is where we, the poor and lower-middle peasants, speak. The column "Seven Hundred Million People All Become Critics" is dedicated to publishing articles written by workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, Red Guards, and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army. It allows us to use this platform to participate in the struggle against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. We, the poor and lower-middle peasants, are very happy about this. This is a victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao.

Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, some newspapers were seized by a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists who controlled their leadership. They published many black articles opposing Mao Zedong Thought and socialism, spreading a lot of capitalist poison to corrupt us, the poor and lower-middle peasants, speaking on behalf of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and serving the restoration of capitalism. However, they did not publish our articles about studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses within the newspaper editorial offices rebelled against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, seized power from them, and frequently published our articles, speaking on our behalf. The People's Daily has a special section dedicated to publishing our big-character posters criticizing the counter-revolutionary crimes of China's Khrushchev. We welcome this very much.

The column "Seven Hundred Million People All Become Critics" publishes articles written by us, workers, and soldiers, speaking what we want to say. The articles are not long, and the language is simple, so both literate and illiterate people can understand them. The writers and readers of these articles not only criticize China's Khrushchev but also educate themselves. We hope this special column will be well-run and are determined to contribute our efforts to make it successful.

### 这是我们贫下中农讲话的地方

    这是我们贫下中农讲话的地方
    《七亿人民都来做批判家》，专门登我们工人、贫下中农、红卫兵小将、解放军指战员写的文章，让我们利用这个阵地参加批判党内最大的一小撮走资派的战斗。我们贫下中农非常高兴。这是毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命的胜利。
    文化大革命以前，一些报纸被一小撮反革命修正主义分子篡夺了领导权。它们登了许多反对毛泽东思想、反对社会主义的黑文章，放出了许多资本主义的毒气，来毒害我们贫下中农，替地、富、反、坏、右分子讲话，为复辟资本主义服务；而我们工农兵活学活用毛主席著作的情况，它们却不登。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，报社里的无产阶级革命派造了党内一小撮走资派的反，夺了他们的权，经常登我们贫下中农的文章，为我们讲话。《人民日报》专门有一块地方，登我们大批判的文章，批判中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命罪行，我们实在欢迎。
    《七亿人民都来做批判家》，登的是我们工农兵自己写的文章，讲的是我们自己要讲的话，文章不长，讲话不多，识字人看得懂，不识字人听得懂；写文章的人和看文章的人，既批判了中国赫鲁晓夫，又教育了自己。我们希望把这个专版办好，也决心为办好这个专版出一分力量。
