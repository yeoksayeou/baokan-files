Premier Zhou Enla, Vice Premier Chen Yi, and other leaders attend a reception hosted by Tanzanian Ambassador Mwaluko to celebrate the fourth anniversary of the founding of the United Republic of Tanzania.

The reception was held at the Tanzanian Embassy in Beijing. Premier Zhou Enla, Vice Premier Chen Yi, and other Chinese leaders attended the event. Ambassador Mwaluko and Vice Premier Chen Yi both spoke at the reception, expressing their hopes for the continued development of friendship between China and Tanzania.

In his speech, Vice Premier Chen Yi emphasized the current favorable international situation. He said that the revolutionary struggles against imperialism and colonialism in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are merging with the struggles for liberation in Europe and North America, launching a powerful assault on the imperialist and colonialist systems. As Chairman Mao has pointed out, "It can be asserted with certainty that the thorough collapse of colonialism, imperialism, and all systems of exploitation, and the thorough emancipation of all oppressed peoples and nations, are not far off."

Vice Premier Chen Yi stressed that, after being tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the 700 million Chinese people will hold aloft the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher and build our country into a powerful socialist state more rapidly. The Chinese government and people will be able to fulfill their internationalist duties more effectively, following Chairman Mao's teachings, and provide more powerful support to the world's peoples, to the peoples of Africa, and to the people of Tanzania in their revolutionary struggles against imperialism.

At the warm and friendly reception, Ambassador Mwaluko spoke first. He enthusiastically praised the friendship between Tanzania and China. He said that mutual benefit, equality, mutual respect for sovereignty, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs are the foundations of friendship and economic cooperation between Tanzania and China. The economic and technical assistance provided by China to Tanzania is beneficial for further consolidating our country's sovereignty and independence and for the self-reliance of the Tanzanian people, and it is beneficial for the liberation of the African peoples from imperialist rule.

The ambassador particularly mentioned the railway project aided by China that will connect Zambia and Tanzania. He said that this railway will have a profound and beneficial economic and social impact on the two sister countries of Tanzania and Zambia. The ambassador also praised the hard work, dedication, high skills, and selflessness of the Chinese technicians and workers helping to build Tanzania.

Ambassador Mwaluko said, "I wish the greatest event in China—the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution—achieves even greater victories. Tanzania regards the victories of the Chinese people as its own victories, as victories for the world forces engaged in the anti-imperialist struggle in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. We are pleased with the unprecedented achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao."

In discussing Tanzania's foreign policy, the ambassador expressed support for the struggles of African peoples for national independence, the struggles of the Arab peoples for justice, and the struggles of black people in the United States. He said, "We firmly believe that the day when the peoples of Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and other regions in southern Africa will ultimately defeat their oppressors and achieve self-liberation is not far off. The struggle is intensifying, and the battles will be even more fierce. The revolutionary situation in southern Africa is better than ever."

Vice Premier Chen Yi, in his speech, praised the rapid development of friendly cooperation between China and Tanzania. He praised Tanzania's efforts under the leadership of President Nyerere to consolidate national independence, oppose imperialist aggression and war policies, and support the struggle for national liberation in Africa. He also praised the achievements made by the Tanzanian people, inspired by the Arusha Declaration, in self-reliance and in various construction projects.

In discussing the current favorable international situation, Vice Premier Chen Yi said that imperialism and colonialism's main stronghold—the U.S. imperialism—has fallen into serious political and economic crises, and its days are numbered. The U.S. imperialism's military defeat in Vietnam, the dollar crisis, and the brave anti-violence struggles of black people in the United States are like three raging fires that have burned the U.S. imperialism to a state of desperation.

Regarding the recent "partial bombing halt" scheme proposed by the Johnson administration for North Vietnam, Vice Premier Chen Yi pointed out that this is a blatant conspiracy and deception. He said that U.S. imperialism attempts to gain at the negotiating table what it cannot achieve on the battlefield, which is a pipe dream that will never come true. The heroic Vietnamese people, under the leadership of Chairman Ho Chi Minh, deeply understand from their own experiences that without victory on the battlefield, no issue can be resolved. In the vast sea of the Vietnamese people's war, awaiting U.S. imperialism is the fate of utter annihilation.

He said that the anti-violence struggles of black people in the United States have swept across more than 100 cities, which is a prominent manifestation of the current political and economic crises facing U.S. imperialism. The struggles of black people in the United States are increasingly adopting violent methods, which is a necessary law of struggle development. All countries and peoples in the world who uphold justice have shown great sympathy and support for the brave struggles of black people in the United States. However, the modern revisionist traitor clique has viciously cursed and labeled the bloody suppression by U.S. imperialism as "restoring order," which once again exposes its role as the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong, in his statement supporting the anti-violence struggles of black people in the United States, pointed out: "The struggle of the black people in the United States is not only a struggle for freedom and liberation by the oppressed and exploited black people but also a new call to arms for all the oppressed and exploited people in the United States against the brutal rule of the monopoly capitalist class." "The struggle of the black people in the United States for liberation is a component of the overall struggle of all the peoples of the world against U.S. imperialism and is a component of the world revolution today." Chairman Mao further said, "The evil system of colonialism and imperialism, which prospered with the enslavement and trafficking of black people, will inevitably come to an end with the complete liberation of the black race." Chairman Mao's statement scientifically analyzes the current world revolutionary situation, expressing the resolute determination of the 700 million Chinese people to stand firmly with the 20 million black brothers in the United States, and is also the resolute support of the 700 million Chinese people for the anti-U.S. struggles of revolutionary peoples around the world.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the situation in the Arab region and Africa is also very favorable. The struggles of the Arab peoples against U.S. imperialism and its aggression tool, Israel, are continuing. The newly independent nations in Africa, in their efforts to oppose imperialism, safeguard national independence, and build their own countries, are strengthening unity and friendly cooperation. The peoples of countries and regions that have not yet achieved independence are intensifying their armed struggles for independence and liberation. As long as the African peoples strengthen their unity and persist in armed struggle, the day when imperialism and old and new colonialism are completely driven out of the African continent will not be far off.

Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, has already achieved decisive victories. Now, the revolutionary people throughout the country are comprehensively implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions and striving for a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The support of the Tanzanian people, the African peoples, and the revolutionary peoples of the world for our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has greatly encouraged the Chinese people. The comprehensive victory of our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will also greatly support and encourage the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed peoples and nations of the world.

The Guinean government economic delegation, led by Minister Ismail Dure, who is currently visiting Beijing, also attended the reception.

Attendees also included officials from various government departments, the People's Liberation Army, the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, and other relevant sectors.

Diplomats from various countries and other international friends were also invited to attend the reception.

    周总理出席坦桑尼亚大使举行的国庆招待会
    世界人民反帝反殖革命斗争形势大好
    中国人民将更好地担负国际主义义务
    陈毅副总理和姆瓦卢科大使在讲话中热情称赞中国和坦桑尼亚之间的友谊不断发展
    新华社二十六日讯　坦桑尼亚驻中国大使姆瓦卢科今晚举行招待会，庆祝坦桑尼亚联合共和国成立四周年。
    国务院总理周恩来，副总理陈毅，人大常委会副委员长郭沫若，以及首都革命群众代表，应邀出席了招待会。
    姆瓦卢科大使和陈毅副总理在招待会上讲了话，他们共祝中国和坦桑尼亚两国和两国人民之间的友谊不断发展。陈毅副总理在讲话中着重谈到了当前世界的大好形势。他说，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的民族民主革命洪流，正同欧洲、北美被压迫人民争取解放的革命斗争汇合起来，向帝国主义和殖民主义制度进行着猛烈的冲击。正如毛泽东主席所指出的：“可以肯定，殖民主义、帝国主义和一切剥削制度的彻底崩溃，世界上一切被压迫人民、被压迫民族的彻底翻身，已经为期不远了。”
    陈毅副总理强调说，经过无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼，七亿中国人民必将更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，更加迅速地把我们的国家建设成为一个强大的社会主义国家。中国政府和中国人民，将能够更好地遵照毛主席的教导，担负起我们应尽的国际主义的义务，更有力地支援世界人民、支援非洲人民、支援坦桑尼亚人民反对帝国主义的革命斗争。
    在充满友好气氛的招待会上，姆瓦卢科大使首先讲话。他热情称赞坦桑尼亚和中国之间的友谊。他说，互利、平等和互相尊重主权以及互不干涉内政是坦桑尼亚和中国友谊和经济合作的基础。中国向坦桑尼亚提供的经济技术援助，有利于进一步巩固我国的主权独立和民族的自力更生，有利于非洲人民从帝国主义统治下解放出来。
    大使特别提到中国援助的将要联结赞比亚和坦桑尼亚的铁路工程。他说，这条铁路将对坦桑尼亚和赞比亚这两个姊妹国家产生深远而有益的经济和社会影响。大使还赞扬了帮助坦桑尼亚建设的中国技术人员和工人的艰苦卓绝的工作、献身的精神、高超的技术和无私的品德。
    姆瓦卢科大使说，我祝愿中国最伟大的事件——无产阶级文化大革命取得更加伟大的胜利。坦桑尼亚把中国人民的胜利当作自己的胜利，当作非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲进行反帝斗争的世界力量的胜利。我们为中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席英明有力的领导和发动的文化大革命所取得的空前的成就而感到高兴。
    大使在谈到坦桑尼亚的对外政策时，表示支持美国黑人的斗争，支持非洲人民争取民族独立的斗争，支持阿拉伯人民的正义斗争。他说，我们坚信津巴布韦、莫三鼻给和非洲南部其他地区的非洲人民，最终打败压迫者而求得自身解放的日子为期不远了。斗争已经加紧，战斗将更为激烈。非洲南部的整个革命形势空前大好。
    陈毅副总理在讲话中赞扬中国和坦桑尼亚两国友好合作关系的迅速发展，赞扬坦桑尼亚在尼雷尔总统的领导下，在巩固民族独立，反对帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，支持非洲民族解放斗争中作出的巨大努力，赞扬坦桑尼亚人民在“阿鲁沙宣言”的鼓舞下，自力更生，在各项建设中取得了新的成就。
    陈毅副总理在谈到当前世界的大好形势时说，帝国主义和殖民主义的主要堡垒——美国帝国主义，已经陷入严重的政治危机和经济危机之中，日子越来越不好过。美帝国主义在越南的军事失败、美元危机和美国黑人的英勇抗暴斗争，就象三把猛烈的大火，把美帝国主义烧得焦头烂额，走投无路。
    谈到约翰逊政府最近抛出的“部分停炸”越南民主共和国的骗和方案时，陈毅副总理指出，这是一个不折不扣的大阴谋、大骗局。他说，美帝国主义妄图在谈判桌上捞取它在战场上得不到的东西，这是白日作梦，是永远办不到的。英雄的越南人民在胡志明主席的领导下，根据自己切身的经历，深深懂得没有战场上的胜利，任何问题都不可能得到解决。在越南人民战争的汪洋大海里，等待着美帝国主义的是灭顶之灾的命运。
    他说，美国黑人的抗暴斗争，席卷了美国一百多个城市，这是美帝国主义当前政治危机和经济危机的一个突出的表现。美国黑人的斗争越来越多地采取暴力的方式，这是斗争发展的必然规律。全世界一切主持正义的国家和人民，都以极大的同情关注和支持美国黑人的英勇斗争。可是，现代修正主义叛徒集团却恶毒咒骂，并把美帝国主义的血腥镇压称之为“建立秩序”，这再一次暴露了它甘作美帝国主义头号帮凶的嘴脸。
    陈毅副总理说，中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志在支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明中指出：“美国黑人的斗争，不仅是被剥削、被压迫的黑人争取自由解放的斗争，而且是整个被剥削、被压迫的美国人民反对垄断资产阶级残暴统治的新号角。”“美国黑人争取解放的斗争，是全世界人民反对美帝国主义的总斗争的一个组成部分，是当代世界革命的一个组成部分。”毛主席又说：“万恶的殖民主义、帝国主义制度是随着奴役和贩卖黑人而兴盛起来的，它也必将随着黑色人种的彻底解放而告终。”毛泽东主席的这一声明，对当前世界革命形势作了科学的论断，不仅表达了七亿中国人民坚定地同美国两千万黑人兄弟站在一起的决心，而且也是七亿中国人民对全世界革命人民反美斗争的坚决支援。
    陈毅副总理说，阿拉伯地区和非洲形势也是一片大好。阿拉伯人民反抗美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列的斗争，正在继续开展。非洲新兴的民族独立国家为反对帝国主义、保卫民族独立和建设自己的国家，正在加强团结，加强友好合作关系。还没有取得独立的国家和地区人民争取独立解放的武装斗争，正在深入开展。非洲人民只要加强团结，坚持武装斗争，帝国主义和新老殖民主义从非洲大陆全部被赶出去的日子，是不会太远的。
    陈毅副总理说，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了决定性的胜利。现在，全国革命人民正在全面落实毛主席的最新指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。坦桑尼亚人民、非洲人民以及全世界革命人民对我国无产阶级文化大革命的支持，给予中国人民以极大鼓舞。我国无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利，也给予全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族的革命斗争以极大的支持和鼓舞。
    正在北京访问的由伊斯梅尔·杜尔部长率领的几内亚政府经济代表团，出席了招待会。
    出席招待会的，还有政府各部门、中国人民解放军、北京市革命委员会和其他有关方面的负责人。
    各国驻中国使节和其他国际友人，也应邀出席了招待会。
