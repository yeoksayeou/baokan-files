Chairman Mao's statement of support for the American black people's struggle against violence will surely be welcomed by progressive whites in the United States. This is the view of the famous American writer Anna Louise Strong, who is currently in Beijing.

New China News Agency, April 19th: In an interview with a reporter from the New China News Agency on the 18th, Anna Louise Strong said that Chairman Mao's statement of support for the American black people's struggle against violence is a very important statement. This statement will surely also be welcomed by progressive whites in the United States.

She discussed the point made by Chairman Mao in the statement: "This storm of struggle by black people is occurring within the United States and is a prominent manifestation of the current political and economic crises facing U.S. imperialism. It has dealt a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism, which is beset by internal and external difficulties." She said that U.S. imperialism is now facing heavy crises, namely: the struggle against the Vietnam War, the black people's struggle against violence sweeping across the country, and the financial crisis. These crises are interconnected and reflect the disintegration of American society.

She said that since last summer, the black movement has swept through more than a hundred cities. In these areas, black people have risen up and fought back against violent suppression with armed struggle. The black movement is developing every year and every month, becoming more powerful and resolute. This struggle will continue, and its target is American monopoly capitalism itself.

In concluding the interview, Anna Louise Strong pointed out: U.S. imperialism is facing many difficulties both domestically and internationally. The days of U.S. imperialism are numbered.

    美国著名作家安娜·路易斯·斯特朗欢呼毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明
    新华社十九日讯　在北京的美国著名作家安娜·路易斯·斯特朗十八日在接见新华社记者时说，毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明是一个非常重要的声明，这个声明一定也会被美国的进步白人所欢迎。
    她谈到了毛主席在声明中说的这个论点：“这场黑人的斗争风暴发生在美国国内，是美帝国主义当前整个政治危机和经济危机的一个突出表现。它给陷于内外交困的美帝国主义以沉重的打击。”她说，美帝国主义现在面临着沉重的危机，那就是：反对进行侵越战争的斗争，遍及全国的黑人抗暴斗争，以及财政危机。这些危机互相联系，显示了美国社会的瓦解。
    她说，从去年夏天以来，黑人运动席卷了一百多个城市。在这些地区，黑人举行起义，用武装斗争抗击暴力镇压。黑人运动每年每月都在发展，变得越来越壮大和坚决。这场斗争必将继续下去，其斗争的矛头也是指向美国垄断资本主义本身。
    安娜·路易斯·斯特朗在结束谈话时指出：美帝国主义在国内外面临着许多困难。美帝国主义的日子是不会长了。
