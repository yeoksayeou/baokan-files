Syrian President Atassi denounces Israeli aggression plot

Points out that Israel's aggression can only strengthen the resolve of the Arab people to fight

New China News Agency Damascus, April 7 - Syrian President Atassi said last night that the Zionists are not satisfied with the new Arab territories they have occupied, and are using the full support of the United States to prepare for new aggression and expansion.

Atassi made these remarks at a meeting held to celebrate the 21st anniversary of the founding of the Arab Socialist Renaissance Party. He said: "While Israel is slaughtering Arabs on the land it has occupied and preparing for war, it is using the United Nations to talk about peace. This lie cannot deceive anyone in the world."

Atassi also said: "Israel's recent attack on Karameh (on the east bank of the Jordan River) was intended to advance its aggression plot and use this action to impose its surrender conditions on the Arab nation. However, this attack was defeated by the heroism of Arab revolutionaries and the Jordanian army. Israel's aggression on Karameh is a wake-up call, making the Arab masses more united and determined to persist."

Atassi said: "Our war against imperialism and Zionism is a long-term one, so let us take all measures to achieve victory."

In his speech, Atassi expressed his belief that the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people will certainly defeat the already badly defeated imperialism.

    叙国家元首阿塔西谴责以色列侵略阴谋
    指出以色列的侵略只能加强阿拉伯人民斗争决心
    新华社大马士革七日电　叙利亚国家元首阿塔西七日晚在这里说，犹太复国主义者并不满足于它新占领的阿拉伯土地，而且还利用美国对它的全力支持，准备进行新的侵略和扩张。
    阿塔西在庆祝阿拉伯复兴社会党成立二十一周年的大会上发表演说时说：“以色列在它占领的土地上屠杀阿拉伯人和准备战争的同时，利用联合国来谈论和平。这种谎言欺骗不了世界上任何人。”
    阿塔西还说：“以色列最近攻击卡拉马（在约旦河东岸）以便推进它的侵略阴谋，并利用这一行动把它的逼降条件强加给阿拉伯民族。但是这个攻击被阿拉伯革命者和约旦军队的英雄主义击败了。以色列对卡拉马的侵略是敲一次警钟，使阿拉伯群众增进团结和加强坚持下去的决心。”
    阿塔西说：“我们同帝国主义和犹太复国主义的战争是长期的，因此让我们采取一切手段来争取胜利。”
    阿塔西在讲话中表示相信，越南人民的英勇斗争，必将战胜已被打得惨败的帝国主义。
