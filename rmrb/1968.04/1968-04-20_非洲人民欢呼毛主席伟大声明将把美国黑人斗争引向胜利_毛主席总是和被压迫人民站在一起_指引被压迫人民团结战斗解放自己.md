    African People Cheer Chairman Mao's Great Statement, Saying It Will Lead the Struggle of American Blacks to Victory
    Chairman Mao Always Stands with the Oppressed People
    Guiding the Oppressed People to Unite and Fight for Their Liberation

    NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, April 19th - Workers, students, and youth from Congo (Brazzaville), Zanzibar, and Mauritania on the 18th spoke to a New China News Agency correspondent, enthusiastically hailing Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence. They pointed out: "The great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, always stands with the oppressed people and nations of the world, and always firmly supports and encourages people in their struggles."

    Uenabio, a worker from Congo (Brazzaville), told the New China News Agency correspondent in Brazzaville: "The great leader of the world revolution, Chairman Mao, always points out the correct path to victory for the peoples of various countries who are struggling for liberation at critical moments."

    Uenabio pointed out: The shouts of bourgeois pacifists and the nonsense of revisionists are actually serving the political purposes of the imperialist aggressors.

    He said, the struggle of American blacks combined with the American workers' movement will accelerate the collapse of the world's number one enemy, the old world's fortress, U.S. imperialism.

    A friend named Ali from Zanzibar told the New China News Agency correspondent, Chairman Mao's statement is not only a powerful support for the struggle of American blacks but also a great encouragement to the revolutionary people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are fighting against imperialism and colonialism led by U.S. imperialism.

    Ali said: "The liberation struggle of American blacks is a part of the total struggle of the people of the world against U.S. imperialism. Chairman Mao has pointed out the great significance of this struggle and seen the power hidden in the struggle of American blacks against violence."

    Ali said, Chairman Mao pointed out: "The struggle of American blacks will inevitably combine with the American workers' movement, ultimately ending the evil rule of the American monopolistic bourgeoisie." Chairman Mao's profound Marxist-Leninist analysis and the correct revolutionary line he pointed out will lead the struggle of American blacks to a higher stage and achieve final victory.

    Another friend from Zanzibar told the New China News Agency correspondent, Chairman Mao's statement will promote the flourishing development of the world's national liberation movement.

    He said: The development of the struggle of American blacks proves that Chairman Mao's assertion that "national struggle, in the final analysis, is a class struggle issue. In the United States, it is only the reactionary ruling clique among the white race that oppresses blacks" is very correct.

    He stressed that American blacks and the revolutionary people of the world should learn a great lesson from the event of Martin Luther King, the advocate of non-violence, being killed by U.S. imperialism. They must take up arms to deal with counter-revolutionary violence to liberate themselves.

    A student from Mauritania in Algiers said: "In the face of bourgeois violence, advocating non-violence is a suicidal act. Blacks in the United States and all oppressed people in the world should respond to Chairman Mao's call, using revolutionary violence to counter revolutionary violence."

    非洲人民欢呼毛主席伟大声明将把美国黑人斗争引向胜利
    毛主席总是和被压迫人民站在一起
    指引被压迫人民团结战斗解放自己
    新华社十九日讯　刚果（布）、桑给巴尔和毛里塔尼亚等非洲工人、学生和青年十八日对新华社记者发表谈话，热烈欢呼毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明，并指出：“世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席总是和世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族在一起，总是坚决支持和鼓舞斗争中的人民。”
    刚果（布）工人乌埃纳比奥在布拉柴维尔对新华社记者说：“世界革命的伟大领袖毛主席，总是在关键性的时刻，向正在为争取解放而斗争的各国人民指明了走向胜利的正确道路”。
    乌埃纳比奥指出：资产阶级和平主义者的叫嚷，修正主义者的胡言乱语，实际上都只是为帝国主义侵略者的政治目的服务的。
    他说，美国黑人的斗争同美国工人运动相结合，将加速全世界革命人民的头号敌人、旧世界的堡垒美帝国主义的崩溃。
    一位名叫阿里的桑给巴尔朋友对新华社记者说，毛主席的声明不仅是对美国黑人斗争的有力支持，也是对正在进行反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争的亚非拉革命人民的巨大鼓舞。
    阿里说：“美国黑人的解放斗争是全世界人民反对美帝国主义的总斗争的一个组成部分。毛主席指出了这个斗争的伟大意义，看到了美国黑人抗暴斗争所蕴藏的力量。”
    阿里说，毛主席指出：“美国黑人斗争必将同美国工人运动相结合，最终结束美国垄断资产阶级的罪恶统治。”毛主席这一透彻的马克思列宁主义的分析和毛主席指出的这一正确的革命路线，必将把美国黑人的斗争引向更高的阶段并使它取得最后的胜利。
    另一位桑给巴尔朋友对新华社记者说，毛主席的声明将推动世界民族解放运动蓬勃开展。
    他说：美国黑人斗争的发展证明，毛主席关于“民族斗争，说到底，是一个阶级斗争问题。在美国压迫黑人的，只是白色人种中的反动统治集团”的论断，是十分正确的。
    他强调指出，美国黑人和世界革命人民应该从非暴力主义者马丁·路德·金被美帝杀害的事件中吸取很大的教训。他们必须拿起武器对付反革命暴力以解放自己。
    一位在阿尔及尔的毛里塔尼亚学生说：“在资产阶级的暴力面前，主张非暴力，这是自杀的行为。美国的黑人和世界上一切被压迫的人民要响应毛主席的号召，以革命的暴力还击反革命的暴力。”
