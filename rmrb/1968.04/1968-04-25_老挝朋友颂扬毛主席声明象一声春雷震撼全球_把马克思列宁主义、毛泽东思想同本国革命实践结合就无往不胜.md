A Laotian progressive said, "Chairman Mao's statement is like a thunderous spring storm, making the revolutionary people of the world look towards the East, towards where the red sun rises, to listen to the great teacher's call to launch a sustained and fierce attack on U.S. imperialism and its running dogs."

He said, "Chairman Mao's statement is the development of his invincible revolutionary thought, and is the basis and direction for the revolutionary people to carry out revolutionary struggles."

He pointed out, "The new storm of the American black people's struggle against violence once again proves that Mao Zedong Thought is a great truth. All oppressed and exploited nations and peoples who want to rise up and seek liberation have only one path: to make revolution according to Mao Zedong Thought." He said, "Only by combining Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought with the revolutionary practice of one's own country can the revolution be invincible."

Another Laotian friend said, "The development process of the American black people's struggle has already and will continue to prove that the great teacher Chairman Mao's revolutionary theory of 'political power grows out of the barrel of a gun' is an unshakable truth. Revolutionary people can only follow Chairman Mao's teachings and wage a resolute and uncompromising struggle against the enemy to achieve final victory."

    老挝朋友颂扬毛主席声明象一声春雷震撼全球
    把马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同本国革命实践结合就无往不胜
    据新华社康开二十三日电　老挝进步人士热烈欢呼毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争声明。
    一位老挝朋友说：“毛主席的声明象一声春雷，使世界革命人民都仰望东方，朝着红太阳升起的地方，倾听伟大导师发出的对美帝及其帮凶进行持久的猛烈的进攻的战斗号召。”
    他说：“毛主席的声明是他老人家战无不胜的革命思想的发展，是革命人民进行革命斗争的依据和方向。”
    他指出：“这次美国黑人抗暴斗争的新风暴，再一次证明了毛泽东思想是伟大的真理。一切被压迫、被剥削的民族和人民要翻身求解放，唯一的道路是按照毛泽东思想闹革命。”他说：“把马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同本国革命实践结合起来，革命才能无往而不胜。”
    另一位老挝朋友说：“美国黑人斗争的发展过程，已经并将继续证明伟大导师毛主席
  ‘枪杆子里面出政权’的革命理论是颠扑不破的真理。革命人民只有遵照毛主席的教导，同敌人进行坚决的、不妥协的斗争，才能取得最后胜利。”
