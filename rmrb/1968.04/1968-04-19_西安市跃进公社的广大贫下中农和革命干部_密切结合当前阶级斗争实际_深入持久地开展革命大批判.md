The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Yanjin Commune in Xi'an, closely combining the current class struggle reality, are carrying out an in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism. According to Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, April 17th — The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Yanjin Commune in Xi'an, firmly remembering Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forget class struggle," closely combine the current class struggle reality, and launch continuous attacks on the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party represented by China's Khrushchev, the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have not been reformed, as well as the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries. They are carrying out an in-depth and sustained revolutionary criticism, greatly enhancing the cadres' and masses' awareness of class struggle, and promoting the commune's revolutionary and production development in a thriving manner.

In the past two years of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the class struggle in Yanjin Commune has been extremely fierce. In the early days of the Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, following the direction indicated by the great leader Chairman Mao, directed the spearhead of struggle at the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. At that time, some landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in this commune stirred up trouble, spread rumors, and created divisions among the revolutionary masses. They even formed so-called "rebel corps" to spread poison and engage in sabotage activities. The revolutionary masses promptly exposed the enemy's plot. When the revolutionary masses united to counterattack the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, a Kuomintang reactionary officer and counter-revolutionary tried every means to sabotage the great alliance of revolutionaries. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in this commune, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, repeatedly defeated the enemy's frenzied counterattacks, consolidated the great alliance of revolutionaries, strengthened the dictatorship of the proletariat, and established the revolutionary committee in January of this year.

In the face of a good revolutionary situation, the class enemies, unwilling to perish, crawled out from the gutters to engage in frenzied sabotage activities, attacking the newly born revolutionary committee. The revolutionary committee of Yanjin Commune convened a mass meeting to engage in a point-by-point struggle and criticism against three landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements who colluded with the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party to maliciously sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Yanjin Commune's focus on class struggle and class struggle education has effectively promoted the thought revolutionization of the commune members and cadres, making the revolution and production prosperous.

    西安市跃进公社的广大贫下中农和革命干部
    密切结合当前阶级斗争实际
    深入持久地开展革命大批判
    据新华社西安十七日电　西安市跃进公社的广大贫下中农和革命干部，牢记毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，密切结合当前的阶级斗争实际，向以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的党内一小撮走资派，没有改造好的地富反坏右分子，以及国民党反动派余孽，不断地发动进攻，深入地持久地开展革命大批判，大大增强了干部和群众的阶级斗争观念，推动了全社革命和生产的蓬勃发展。
    跃进公社在近两年的文化大革命中，阶级斗争一直十分激烈。文化大革命初期，广大贫下中农和革命干部，遵循伟大领袖毛主席指引的方向，把斗争矛头指向党内一小撮走资派的时候，这个公社的一些地富反坏右分子，煽阴风，点鬼火，在革命群众中制造分裂，甚至拼凑起所谓“造反队”，大肆放毒，进行破坏活动。革命群众及时地揭露了阶级敌人的阴谋活动。当革命群众联合起来，向党内一小撮走资派和地富反坏右分子进行反击的时候，有一个国民党反动军官、反革命分子，千方百计破坏革命大联合，这个公社的广大贫下中农和革命干部，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，一次又一次地打垮了阶级敌人的猖狂反扑，巩固了革命大联合，加强了无产阶级专政，于今年一月成立了革命委员会。
    在一派大好的革命形势下，阶级敌人不甘心灭亡，又从阴沟里爬出来进行疯狂的破坏活动，攻击新生的革命委员会。跃进公社革命委员会召开群众大会，对同党内一小撮走资派内外呼应、恶毒破坏文化大革命的三个地富反坏分子进行了针锋相对的批判斗争。
    跃进公社大抓阶级斗争和阶级斗争教育，有力地促进社员和干部的思想革命化，使革命和生产呈现一片欣欣向荣的景象。
