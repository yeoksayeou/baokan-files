The important editorial "Revolutionary Committees Are Good" published in the *People's Daily*, *Red Flag* magazine, and *Liberation Army Daily* conveys our great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions on revolutionary committees. This is a great event for the revolutionary masses nationwide! We cheer, we sing, and we will unconditionally implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

"Revolutionary committees are good!" This is the heartfelt shout of the broad revolutionary masses. Although the Revolutionary Committee of Nanjing University has only been established for a short time, like revolutionary committees across the country, it has already shown vigorous vitality, bringing about fundamental changes in our school.

The practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has made us deeply realize that to make revolution, we must rely on Mao Zedong Thought. After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, we must take the study, implementation, promotion, and defense of Mao Zedong Thought as our fundamental task. As soon as the committee was established, we spared no effort to organize various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes.

The movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has reached a new high tide throughout the school. Through study, everyone feels that proletarian party spirit has increased, while bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism has decreased; organizational discipline has strengthened, and anarchism has decreased. Many departments, through organizing study classes, have seen a significant improvement in the spiritual outlook of revolutionary teachers and students, with an unprecedented atmosphere of studying Chairman Mao's works and political enthusiasm. A spirit of unity, tension, seriousness, and liveliness is gradually taking shape across the campus. The movement to resume classes and carry out the revolution has taken on a new look.

We firmly remember the great teacher Chairman Mao's instruction to "never forget class struggle" and grasp this key link. Through the struggle against a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, we have rectified the class ranks, taken the initiative to launch attacks on the enemy, and raised the class consciousness of the masses. In the class struggle, revolutionary great alliances and the three-in-one combination have been further consolidated and developed. Revolutionary committees in various departments and units have been established one after another, and the school revolutionary committee has been continuously consolidated and improved in the struggle.

Chairman Mao said, "The most fundamental point in reforming state organs is to link up with the masses." We follow the great teacher Chairman Mao's instruction to link up with the masses and take root among them as a fundamental measure for the revolutionization of the leading cadre. According to Chairman Mao's instruction to "not seek office but to make revolution" and the principle of "streamlining administration," we have thoroughly overhauled the old, redundant organizational structure, implementing the system of "standing committee on duty, committee members among the masses." This has changed the past phenomenon of bloated organizations, excessive personnel, and the "passing the buck" approach to handling problems, preventing the growth of bureaucratism.

After implementing the system of "standing committee on duty, committee members among the masses," members of the revolutionary committee, except for being on duty, attending meetings, and handling necessary matters, return to their respective units and classes. This way, the opinions and wishes of the masses can be quickly reflected in the revolutionary committee, and the intentions and plans of the leadership can be promptly conveyed to the masses. This has tightened the relationship between cadres and the masses. In the past, many cadres were full of officialdom and did not do ideological work among the masses. The masses kept their distance from the cadres, and the cadres' prestige among the masses was not high. Members of the revolutionary committee are both "officials" and ordinary people, studying and fighting together with the masses, sharing common thoughts and language. Some comrades have said well: in the past, the relationship between cadres and the masses was like oil and water, but now it is like fish and water.

Our school's revolutionary committee was born not long ago, and just as we are groping our way forward, Chairman Mao's latest instructions on revolutionary committees were issued. Chairman Mao's latest instructions are like dew that moistens our hearts and like a lighthouse that illuminates our path forward. We are confident that under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, our school's revolutionary committee will be further consolidated, developed, and improved in the struggle.

    毛主席最新指示照亮了我们前进的路程
    南京大学革命委员会
    《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》的重要社论《革命委员会好》，传达了我们伟大领袖毛主席关于革命委员会的最新指示。这是全国无产阶级革命派的大喜事！我们欢呼，我们歌唱，我们要不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席这一最新指示。
    “革命委员会好！”这是广大无产阶级革命派发自内心的欢呼。我们南京大学革命委员会虽然成立不久，但它和全国各地的革命委员会一样，已经显示了它的朝气勃勃的强大生命力，使我校发生了根本性的变化。
    无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践，使我们深刻地体会到：干革命就得靠毛泽东思想。革命委员会建立以后，就得把学习、执行、宣传和捍卫毛泽东思想，作为自己最根本的任务。革委会一成立，我们就全力以赴，大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。
    全校活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动出现了新高潮。通过学习，大家都觉得无产阶级党性多了，资产阶级、小资产阶级派性少了；组织纪律性强了，无政府主义少了。许多系通过大办学习班，革命师生员工的精神面貌焕然一新，学习毛主席著作的气氛空前的浓，政治热情空前的高。团结、紧张、严肃、活泼的战斗作风，正在全校逐步形成。复课闹革命出现了新气象。
    我们牢记伟大导师毛主席的“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，狠抓阶级斗争这个纲。通过斗争党内一小撮走资派，整顿阶级队伍，主动向敌人发动猛攻，提高了群众的阶级觉悟。在阶级斗争中，革命的大联合和革命的三结合日益巩固和发展。各系各单位的革命委员会一个接一个地成立起来，校革命委员会也在斗争中不断地巩固和完善。
    毛主席说：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”我们遵循伟大导师毛主席的教导，把联系群众，扎根于群众之中，作为领导班子革命化的一项根本措施。我们按照毛主席“不是要做官，而是要革命”的教导，根据“精兵简政”的原则，大破旧的一套重叠的机构，实行“常委值班，委员在群众中”的制度，改变了以往机构臃肿，人浮于事，以及处理问题“踢皮球”的现象，防止官僚主义莠草的产生。
    实行“常委值班，委员在群众中”的制度以后，革命委员会成员除了值班、开会和处理必要的事情以外，仍回本单位、本班级。这样做，群众的意见、愿望可以迅速反映到革委会中来，领导的意图、计划也能及时地传达到群众中去。这就密切了干部和群众的关系。过去，不少干部官气十足，不做群众的思想工作。群众对干部“敬而远之”，干部在群众中威信不高。革命委员会成员，既是“官”也是老百姓，和群众一起学习，一起战斗，彼此有共同的思想，共同的语言。一些同志说得好：过去干部和群众是“油水关系”，现在干部和群众是鱼水关系。
    我校革命委员会诞生不久，正当我们在摸索前进的时候，毛主席关于革命委员会的最新指示发表了。毛主席的最新指示，象雨露一样滋润着我们的心田，象灯塔一样照亮了我们前进的道路。我们深信，在毛主席最新指示的指引下，我校革命委员会将在斗争中进一步巩固、发展和完善起来。（附图片）
