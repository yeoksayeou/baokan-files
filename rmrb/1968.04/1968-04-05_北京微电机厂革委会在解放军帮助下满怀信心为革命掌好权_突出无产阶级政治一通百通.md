The Revolutionary Committee of Beijing Micro-Motor Factory, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, is full of confidence in grasping the power for the revolution. By emphasizing proletarian politics, everything becomes smooth.

The Revolutionary Committee of the factory has concentrated its greatest efforts on organizing various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, leading the masses to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively. The spiritual outlook of the majority of workers has undergone a fundamental change, and the entire factory has seen a new situation in both revolution and production.

	NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, April 4 -- Strike at politics, and everything becomes empty; emphasize politics, and everything becomes smooth. This is a profound understanding gained by the Revolutionary Committee of Beijing Micro-Motor Factory in summarizing its work. With the help of the PLA in supporting the left, they quickly reversed the phenomenon of neglecting the emphasis on proletarian politics in the early days of the Revolutionary Committee's establishment. In the midst of countless tasks, they grasped the root, making the entire factory's revolution and production present a new situation.

	On December 30 last year, the Revolutionary Committee of Beijing Micro-Motor Factory was born amidst the joyous sound of drums. The thirteen committee members, full of confidence, took over the seal of the entire factory from the revolutionary workers and shouldered the dual responsibilities of revolution and production.

	With power concentrated, contradictions also concentrated. Work was chaotic, and various specific problems required the Revolutionary Committee to solve. Faced with this chaos, the committee members did not know what to grasp first.

	The PLA comrades supporting the left in the factory discovered this situation and, together with the committee members, sought guidance from Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao taught, "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work. This is especially true during periods of fundamental changes in the socio-economic system." Chairman Mao's teachings were like a shining golden key, unlocking the hearts of the committee members. They unanimously recognized that whether or not to grasp the root, whether or not to emphasize proletarian politics, is a matter of life and death for the country, the party, and the Revolutionary Committee. It is a sharp and intense class struggle. Without emphasizing proletarian politics, one would inevitably emphasize bourgeois politics and unconsciously lead the masses down the path of revisionism. They decided to seriously study the New Year's editorial of the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and the PLA Daily in 1968, and to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment bravely forward. The next morning, as soon as they went to work, all the committee members of the Revolutionary Committee and the PLA supporting the left, divided into three groups, holding high the portrait of Chairman Mao and the sign with Chairman Mao's words "Fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," went to various workshops and departments to check on the errors made by the Revolutionary Committee after its establishment, neglecting the root cause. They distributed a small booklet containing the New Year's editorial of the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and the PLA Daily in 1968 to every worker in the factory. This revolutionary action of the Revolutionary Committee immediately shook the entire factory. A wave of studying and implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions thoroughly swept through the factory.

	Chairman Mao taught us, "Organizing study classes is a good method, and many problems can be solved in study classes." The Revolutionary Committee of Beijing Micro-Motor Factory and the PLA supporting the left visited and learned from the Beijing Knitting General Factory three times. The factory Revolutionary Committee, following Chairman Mao's teachings, took the Beijing Knitting General Factory as an example, made the greatest resolve, and concentrated the greatest efforts to continue to vigorously organize and run various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, making various workshops and departments set up part-time Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The study classes focused on "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism," conducting education on the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, greatly raising the consciousness of the revolutionary workers. Then, the factory Revolutionary Committee further mobilized the masses to launch a new high tide of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, with the focus on studying the "Old Three Articles" and transforming one's worldview.

	In all these activities, they firmly grasped the issue of attitude towards the great leader Chairman Mao, the great Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, establishing Chairman Mao's personally advocated revolutionary study style, and guiding the masses to temper their loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao in the process of actively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. In a short time, more than 90% of the workers in the entire factory spoke about their experiences in studying Chairman Mao's works in small group, workshop, and factory study meetings. The spiritual outlook of the revolutionary workers in the entire factory underwent a fundamental change, and all work made rapid progress, with production steadily increasing.

	The committee members of the Micro-Motor Factory Revolutionary Committee, through this period of practice, deeply realized: in work, whether to use politics as the guiding principle or to use business as the guiding principle, is a struggle between two lines. In the past, production dispatch meetings only discussed production, and the dispatch meetings often turned into bickering sessions. Problems were not solved, and everyone left unsatisfied. After grasping the root of emphasizing proletarian politics, in the production dispatch meetings, the committee members in charge of production did not first discuss production but led everyone to study the "Old Three Articles" and Chairman Mao's quotations in response to various active thoughts, and then discuss thoughts and fight against selfishness. In this way, the dispatch meetings turned into self-criticism meetings. Everyone discussed difficulties and their own solutions, and many "old difficult" problems were easily solved. The meeting was full of a spirit of unity and mutual assistance, and everyone became more enthusiastic. The committee members of the Revolutionary Committee sighed, "In the past, we only talked about production, achieving nothing. Now, we grasp the revolution and promote production, and everything becomes smooth." Work is chaotic, but by grasping the root of the ideological revolution of the people, people's ideological awareness is raised, and everything is achieved. Enthusiasm is generated, creativity is generated, organizational discipline is generated, and material results come one after another.

    北京微电机厂革委会在解放军帮助下满怀信心为革命掌好权
    突出无产阶级政治一通百通
    厂革委会集中最大力量，大办各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，组织群众活学活用毛主席著作，广大职工的精神面貌起了根本变化，全厂革命和生产出现了崭新局面
    新华社四日讯　冲击政治，一冲百空；突出政治，一通百通。这是北京微电机厂革命委员会在总结工作中得出的一条深刻的体会。他们在支左人民解放军的帮助下，迅速扭转革命委员会成立初期忽视突出无产阶级政治的现象，在千头万绪的工作中，狠抓根本，使全厂的革命和生产出现了一个崭新的局面。
    去年十二月三十日，北京微电机厂革命委员会在欢腾的锣鼓声中胜利诞生了。革委会的十三个委员，满怀信心地接过了全厂革命职工交给他们的大印，挑起了革命、生产两副重担。
    权力集中了，矛盾也集中了。工作千头万绪，各种各样的具体问题要求革命委员会解决。在这千头万绪的工作面前，革命委员会的委员们不知道先抓什么才好。
    在厂里支左的解放军同志发现这种情况后，就和革委会成员一起向毛主席请教。毛主席教导说：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。在社会经济制度发生根本变革的时期，尤其是这样。”毛主席的教导象金光闪闪的金钥匙，打开了革委会委员们心上的锁。他们一致认识到，抓不抓根本，突出不突出无产阶级政治，是关系到国家存亡，党的存亡，革命委员会存亡的头等大事，是一场尖锐激烈的阶级斗争。不突出无产阶级政治，就必然要突出资产阶级政治，就会不自觉地把群众领到修正主义的道路上去。他们决定认真学习《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》一九六八年元旦社论，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署奋勇前进。第二天早晨一上班，革命委员会的全体委员和支左人民解放军，分三路高举毛主席像和“要斗私，批修”的毛主席语录牌，到各车间、科室去，向职工检查革命委员会成立以后忽视抓根本的错误，发给全厂职工每人一本《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》一九六八年元旦社论的小册子。革命委员会的这个革命行动立即震动了全厂。一个大学元旦社论，全面落实毛主席最新指示的高潮，很快在厂里蓬勃兴起。
    毛主席教导我们：“办学习班，是个好办法，很多问题可以在学习班得到解决。”北京微电机厂革委会和支左的人民解放军，三次到北京针织总厂去访问学习。厂革委会遵循毛主席的教导，以北京针织总厂为榜样，下最大的决心，集中最大的力量，继续狠狠抓紧大办、办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，使各车间、科室纷纷办起了业余毛泽东思想学习班。学习班以“斗私，批修”为纲，进行两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的教育，大大提高了革命职工的觉悟。接着，厂革命委员会又进一步发动群众，开展了一个以大学“老三篇”，改造世界观为中心的活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。
    在所有这些活动中，他们都狠狠抓住对伟大领袖毛主席、伟大的毛泽东思想和毛主席革命路线的态度问题，大立毛主席亲自倡导的革命学风，引导群众在活学活用毛泽东思想的过程中锤炼对伟大领袖毛主席的一颗忠心。在很短时间内，全厂百分之九十以上的职工分别在小组、车间、全厂学习会上讲了学习毛主席著作的心得。全厂广大革命职工的精神面貌起了根本的变化，各项工作突飞猛进，生产稳步上升。
    微电机厂革命委员会的委员通过这一段实践，深刻地认识到：在工作中到底是用政治挂帅，还是用业务挂帅，这是两条路线的斗争。过去开生产调度会，就生产谈生产，调度会往往开成扯皮会，不但问题没有解决，大家还弄个不欢而散。抓住了突出无产阶级政治这个根本以后，在生产调度会上，革命委员会管生产的委员没有先谈生产，而是带领大家针对各种活思想学习
  “老三篇”和毛主席语录，然后谈思想，斗“私”字。这样，调度会成了斗私会，大家既谈困难，又谈自己解决困难的办法，许多“老大难”问题就迎刃而解了，会上充满了团结互助的气氛，大家越开越有劲儿。革命委员会的委员们感慨地说：“过去就生产论生产，一事无成，现在抓革命促生产，一通百通。”工作千头万绪，抓住人的思想革命化这个根本，人的思想觉悟提高了，就什么都有了，积极性有了，创造性有了，组织纪律性也有了，物质成果就源源而来。
