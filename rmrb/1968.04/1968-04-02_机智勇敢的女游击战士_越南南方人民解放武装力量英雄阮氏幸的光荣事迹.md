		Clever and Brave Female Guerrilla Fighter
		—The Glorious Deeds of Hero of the People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam Nguyen Thi Hanh

	Nguyen Thi Hanh is the daughter of a poor peasant from Long An Province in South Vietnam. From her youth, she participated in the struggle against American imperialism and for national liberation. Through the revolutionary storm, she grew into an outstanding female guerrilla fighter.

		At a time when the American puppet regime was frantically establishing "strategic hamlets" to isolate revolutionary fighters from the masses, Nguyen Thi Hanh was assigned the task of going to her hometown's "strategic hamlet" to mobilize the people. She entered the "L.T. strategic hamlet" despite being ill, and went deep into the community to carry out her work. Patiently, she explained to the people the principles of resisting American imperialism and saving the nation. Under her influence and mobilization, many people in this "strategic hamlet" took action and joined the struggle against American imperialism. Nguyen Thi Hanh organized one secret revolutionary mass organization and guerrilla unit after another. Even some elderly women actively participated in the struggle, and some became her reliable assistants. Nguyen Thi Hanh had taken root among the people, and under the protection of the masses, the enemy was powerless against her.

		Nguyen Thi Hanh was very clever and brave in battle.

		Once, during the puppet regime's fake "elections," the guerrilla unit was tasked with punishing the enemy. After Nguyen Thi Hanh planted explosives in one location, she posted many slogans and leaflets nearby. The enemy, seeing the slogans and leaflets, rushed over. Suddenly, two explosions... killed and wounded several enemy soldiers. At this moment, other comrades in ambush in the "L.T. strategic hamlet" also threw hand grenades at the enemy. The enemy was in chaos. The villagers took the opportunity to throw pre-written small slogans exposing the enemy into the enemy's "ballot boxes." The enemy's fake "election" in the "L.T. strategic hamlet" thus failed.

		Nguyen Thi Hanh was also a clever scout.

		On a rainy night, Nguyen Thi Hanh, carrying a lantern, walked towards the "L.T. strategic hamlet." A platoon from the local liberation army followed her from a distance, all watching the lantern in her hand. Nguyen Thi Hanh reached a crossroads and heard the sound of bullets being loaded into a gun, followed by a shout: "Who's there? Halt!"

		Nguyen Thi Hanh immediately realized that the puppet security forces were ambushing there. She raised the lantern and calmly replied in a loud voice, "I went to my uncle's house and am just returning now!"

		The enemy, knowing they had been exposed, quickly retreated. At this moment, Nguyen Thi Hanh raised the lantern and shone it in the direction of the enemy's retreat. The liberation army, seeing this signal, turned around and ambushed the enemy. Thus, the liberation army not only avoided falling into the enemy's trap but also actively attacked the enemy, annihilating an entire enemy platoon.

		To prepare for the liberation army's attack on the enemy's stronghold, Nguyen Thi Hanh was tasked with investigating the number of enemy soldiers, types of weapons, and drawing a sketch of the stronghold. This task was very arduous, but she thought: after the enemy stronghold is destroyed, the homeland will be liberated. Therefore, she worked with great enthusiasm.

		Nguyen Thi Hanh almost always passed by the enemy stronghold. Sometimes she rode a bicycle on the road, but as she approached the stronghold, her bicycle would "break down." She would push the bicycle while keeping her eyes on the inside of the stronghold. Sometimes she drove a cart past the stronghold. She sat on the cart, but her eyes were focused on the situation inside the barbed wire and the various weapons set up inside and outside the stronghold. Sometimes she appeared at the small stalls set up by the families of puppet soldiers near the stronghold, either buying or selling things. Through these transactions, she gathered information about the stronghold. She also befriended a puppet soldier's wife. Nguyen Thi Hanh often visited her house early in the morning, taking advantage of the opportunity when the enemy inside the stronghold was assembling for roll call to learn about the number of enemy soldiers and their weapons. A talkative puppet soldier even revealed to her the positions of various weapons. After obtaining this information, Nguyen Thi Hanh reported to her superiors. She spread out the sketch she had drawn and detailed the situation. She also personally guided the attacking troops. Because she was familiar with the situation and understood the enemy's activities, the troops won a victory.

		Nguyen Thi Hanh has performed many heroic deeds on her homeland's soil. She and the guerrilla units she organized fought in 380 battles, annihilating a large number of enemy soldiers. After her homeland was liberated, she continued to fight in new battles.

### 机智勇敢的女游击战士——越南南方人民解放武装力量英雄阮氏幸的光荣事迹

    机智勇敢的女游击战士
    ——越南南方人民解放武装力量英雄阮氏幸的光荣事迹
    阮氏幸是越南南方隆安省一个贫农的女儿，从少年开始参加抗美救国斗争，在革命的风暴中锻炼成长，成为一个优秀的女游击战士。
    正当美伪集团疯狂地建立“战略村”，企图把革命战士同广大人民隔离开来的时候，阮氏幸接受了到家乡的“战略村”去发动群众的任务。她带着病进入了“L·T战略村”，深入到乡亲中去开展工作，耐心地向群众宣传抗美救国的道理。在她的宣传和动员下，这个“战略村”的许多群众都行动起来，参加抗美救国斗争。阮氏幸组织了一个又一个秘密的群众革命组织和游击队，连一些老大娘也都积极参加斗争，有的还成了阮氏幸的得力助手。阮氏幸在群众中扎下了根，在广大群众的掩护下，敌人对她无可奈何。
    阮氏幸在战斗中是非常机智和勇敢的。
    一次，在伪政权举行伪“国会”选举时，游击队接受了惩罚敌人的任务。阮氏幸在一个地方埋好了爆炸物之后，在附近贴了许多标语和传单。敌人看见标语、传单，纷纷跑来。突然，只听得两声巨响……，炸死、炸伤好几个敌人。这时候，埋伏在“L·T战略村”的其他战友也向敌人投出了手榴弹。敌人乱成一团。老乡们乘机把预先写好的揭露敌人的小标语投入敌人的“票箱”。敌人在“L·T战略村”搞的伪“选举”，就这样破产了。
    阮氏幸还是一个机智的侦察员。
    在一个下着毛毛细雨的晚上，阮氏幸打着灯笼朝着“L·T战略村”走去。解放军地方部队的一个排，远远地跟在她后头。他们都看着阮氏幸手中的灯笼。阮氏幸走到一个路口，听见咔嚓咔嚓推子弹上枪膛的声音，接着便是一声?喝：“谁？站住！”
    阮氏幸一听便知道是伪保安队在这里埋伏着，她便把灯笼提起来，沉着地高声回答：“我到姑丈家去了，现在才回来！”
    敌人知道自己已暴露了，便赶忙撤走。这时候，阮氏幸把灯笼提起来，朝着敌人撤退的方向照去。解放军看到这个信号，便拐了个弯，迎头截住敌人。这样，解放军不但没有陷入敌人的埋伏圈，反而主动地袭击敌人，全歼敌人一个排。
    为了给解放军部队袭击敌军据点作好准备，阮氏幸接受了调查敌军人数、武器种类和画一个据点草图的任务。这项任务十分艰巨，但是她想到：敌人的据点被摧毁以后，家乡就解放了。因此，工作起来劲头特别大。
    阮氏幸几乎每天都从敌人据点外边走过。有时她骑着自行车在路上跑，但接近据点时，她的车就“坏”了，她边拖着车走，眼睛却望着据点里边。有时她赶着大车，从据点前边经过。她坐在车上，眼睛却注视着铁丝网里边的情况，注视着架设在据点内外的各种武器。有时她出现在伪军家属在敌人据点附近摆的小货摊旁，或者买东西，或者卖东西。通过买卖，探听据点里的情况。她还同一个伪军的妻子交了“朋友”。阮氏幸常在清早到她家去“玩”，趁据点里的敌人集合点名的机会，了解敌军人数和武器等情况。一个喜欢夸夸其谈的伪军还向她泄露了各种武器所放的位置。阮氏幸掌握了这些情况之后，便找上级去汇报。她把自己画的草图摊开，详细地介绍了情况。她还亲自给进攻的部队作向导。由于熟悉情况，掌握敌人的活动规律，部队打了胜仗。
    阮氏幸在家乡的土地上立下了许多战功。她和她组织的游击队进行了三百八十多次战斗，消灭了大量敌人。在家乡解放以后，她又投入了新的战斗。
