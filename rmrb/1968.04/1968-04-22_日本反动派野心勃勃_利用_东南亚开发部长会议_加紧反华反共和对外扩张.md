The so-called "East Asian Development Ministers' Conference," manipulated by U.S. imperialism and hosted by the Sato government of Japan, was held in Singapore for three days and concluded on the 11th. The conference revealed that the U.S. imperialism's running dog, the Japanese reactionaries, are intensifying their anti-communist and anti-China conspiracies in Southeast Asia.

This conference was held at a time when the U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam has suffered a severe setback, and the U.S. is having an increasingly difficult time in Southeast Asia. Representatives from Japan, "Malaysia," Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, South Vietnam, and Laos, which are the U.S. imperialism's running dogs and puppet regimes, attended the conference. Reactionary authorities from India, Australia, and New Zealand participated as observers for the first time.

In accordance with the intentions of U.S. imperialism, the representative of the Sato reactionary government, Japanese Foreign Minister Miki Takeo, worked hard at this conference to serve the U.S. policy of aggression in Vietnam. He held a secret meeting with the "Minister of Economy" of the South Vietnamese puppet regime, expressing Japan's willingness to contribute to the "stabilization" of the reactionary rule in Saigon. Before the conference began, the U.S. Ambassador to Japan met with Sato Eisaku on April 7, requesting that the Sato government provide "active cooperation" in the U.S. policy of aggression in Vietnam.

The Japanese reactionaries are using the so-called "East Asian Development Ministers' Conference" to carry out anti-China and anti-communist activities and realize their ambition to reoccupy Southeast Asia. During the conference, Miki held lengthy discussions with some of the U.S. imperialism's lackeys about the situation where British colonial forces are withdrawing from Southeast Asia. He stated that Japan would play a "significant role" in the "peace and security" of Southeast Asia. Japanese newspapers admitted that the term "peace and security" in the conference statement is actually a euphemism for anti-China and suppressing national liberation movements. It is reported that during his meeting with the "Malaysian" representative, Miki discussed the issue of establishing a "security guarantee system" to "counter" China.

To expedite the expansion of its influence in Southeast Asia, Miki declared before the conference that "Japan has the responsibility to develop the 'East Asian Development Ministers' Conference' into a complete organization." Subsequently, the conference decided, under Miki's proposal, to establish a "Joint Working Committee" to handle "related matters" decided by this conference after its closure. The Japanese reactionaries intend to gradually establish their sphere of influence through this institution and carry out political and economic expansion.

    日本反动派野心勃勃
    利用“东南亚开发部长会议”加紧反华反共和对外扩张
    据新华社讯　由美帝国主义操纵、由日本佐藤政府出面主持的所谓“东南亚开发部长会议”，在新加坡开了三天会，于十一日收场。会议表明，美帝的侵略帮凶日本反动派，正在东南亚加紧推行反共反华的阴谋。
    这次会议是在美帝侵越战争遭到惨败，美帝在东南亚的日子越来越不好过的情况下召开的。参加会议的有日本、“马来西亚”、泰国、菲律宾、印度尼西亚、南越和老挝等美帝的帮凶和傀儡集团的代表。印度、澳大利亚、新西兰等反动当局以观察员身份第一次参加了会议。
    按照美帝国主义的意旨，佐藤反动政府的代表、日本外相三木武夫，在这次会议上拚命为美帝的侵越政策效劳。他特别同南越傀儡集团的“经济部长”举行了秘密会议，表示日本要为“稳定”西贡反动当局的统治做出“贡献”。在这次会议开场之前，美国驻日大使在四月七日会见了佐藤荣作，要求佐藤政府在美国的侵越政策上“给予积极合作”。
    日本反动派竭力利用所谓“东南亚开发部长会议”来反华反共和实现其重新霸占东南亚的野心。在会议期间，三木分别同美帝的一些走卒就英国殖民军将从东南亚撤走的形势进行了长时间的会谈。他表示日本要对东南亚的“和平与安全”起“很大的作用”。日本报刊承认，会谈公报中所谓的“和平与安全”，实际上是反华和镇压民族解放运动的同义语。据透露，三木在同“马来西亚”代表会谈时谈到了建立“安全保障体制”来同中国“对抗”的问题。
    为了加紧向东南亚扩张势力，三木在会前叫嚷说，“日本有责任把‘东南亚开发部长会议’培养成为完善的组织”。随后，会议就在三木的提议下决定设立“联合工作委员会”，以便在“东南亚开发部长会议”闭幕之后处理这次会议决定的“有关事宜”。日本反动派企图通过这个机构逐渐建立起日本的势力范围，进行政治和经济扩张。
