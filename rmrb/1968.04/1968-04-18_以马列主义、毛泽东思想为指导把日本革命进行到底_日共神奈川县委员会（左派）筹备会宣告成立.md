The preparatory committee of the leftist faction of the Japanese Communist Party in Kanagawa Prefecture was established on March 24.

At the establishment conference of the preparatory committee, a declaration was adopted. The declaration stated: "Mao Zedong Thought is Marxism-Leninism in the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards global victory." The declaration expressed that the leftist faction of the Japanese Communist Party in Kanagawa Prefecture will take Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as its guiding ideology, inherit the revolutionary tradition of the Japanese Communist Party, and fight against American imperialism, Japanese monopolistic capital, Soviet modern revisionism, and Miyamoto revisionism.

The declaration said: "The end of American imperialism and Japanese militarism has arrived, and therefore they are becoming more brutal. The Miyamoto revisionist group has become a running dog of American imperialism and Japanese monopolistic capital, the most vicious enemy of the Japanese working class and people. It is a historical necessity to eliminate it."

The declaration said: In Japan, revolutionary leftists in various places have risen up one after another, and this force is becoming stronger day by day. We firmly believe that as long as we hold high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, defend the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, learn from the revolutionary history of the Japanese people, the struggle against imperialism and revisionism will surely win. We will strengthen our unity with Marxist-Leninist parties around the world and fight together under the banner of proletarian internationalism.

The declaration said: We are located in the (eastern) Tokyo (western) Yokohama heavy industrial area. We are determined to inherit and carry forward the fine traditions of the Keihin workers, temper ourselves in the fierce struggle of the masses, and fight to the end for the Japanese revolution. Through this struggle, we will build "a disciplined party, armed with Marxist-Leninist theory, using the method of self-criticism, and connected with the masses."

The declaration concluded with the slogans: Long live the advance of the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle! Long live the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought! (with picture)

The revolutionary people of Japan, holding high Chairman Mao's red book, are waging a heroic and unyielding struggle against the reactionary forces of the United States and Japan and the Miyamoto revisionist group of the Japanese Communist Party.
