The joyous news from the foot of the Liupan Mountains, where the great leader Chairman Mao led the Red Army on the Long March, has reverberated across the nation. The military and civilian populace nationwide are jubilantly celebrating the birth of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. This marks another great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. People from all regions have expressed their determination to carry forward Chairman Mao's spirit of "Not reaching the Great Wall is no hero," to redouble their efforts, strive for excellence, and press ahead with the momentum, ensuring the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Upon receiving the news, the revolutionary committees and preparatory groups of Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Shandong, Guizhou, Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, Jiangxi, Gansu, Hebei, Henan, Guangdong, Hubei, Hunan, Jilin, Guangxi, and other provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have all sent congratulatory telegrams to the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, expressing their heartfelt congratulations and respect to the Ningxia military and civilian populace who are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Many places have pointed out during the celebrations for the establishment of the Ningxia Revolutionary Committee that the birth of the revolutionary committees in Ningxia and most provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country is a significant sign of the unprecedentedly good and increasingly favorable situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution nationwide. They have expressed their determination to further implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions regarding the revolutionary committees and a series of other latest instructions, building each local revolutionary committee into a revolutionary command center that is forever loyal to Chairman Mao, emphasizes proletarian politics, has proletarian revolutionary authority, and can lead the revolutionary masses in fighting against the enemies of the proletariat. They will vigorously organize Mao Zedong Thought study classes, consolidate and develop revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their units, promote both revolution and production, and push the nationwide favorable situation forward.

The revolutionary populace in regions neighboring Ningxia, such as Shaanxi and Xinjiang, as well as other provinces and autonomous regions that are actively preparing to establish revolutionary committees, have been inspired by the joyous news from the foot of the Liupan Mountains. They are determined to learn from the revolutionary masses and the People's Liberation Army stationed in Ningxia, with the spirit of "seizing the day," further develop and consolidate revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, catch up, and strive for the early establishment of local revolutionary committees.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a great political revolution under the conditions of socialism, where the proletariat fights against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the revolutionary masses it leads and the reactionary Kuomintang. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Broad masses of revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, and PLA soldiers across the country, while celebrating the birth of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, have been studying and deeply understanding Chairman Mao's latest instruction. They are determined to remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," resolutely opposing right opportunism and right splitism, mountainism, and sectarianism, opposing two-faced people, and repelling the class enemies' "reversal" black wind, launching unremitting attacks on the class enemies.

Revolutionary masses in the capital have pointed out that the joyous news from the "land of rivers and lakes in the frontier" is a great encouragement to us. The more the situation is good and victories are frequent, the more we must strengthen our awareness of the enemy, strengthen military-civilian unity, strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, safeguard the newly born revolutionary committees, and resolutely strike down all sabotage activities by the class enemies. The Tianjin Revolutionary Committee held a meeting today to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They expressed their determination to grasp the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, raise the banner of revolutionary criticism higher, thoroughly criticize the revisionist line of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Tianjin, and launch a comprehensive attack on the class enemies. Revolutionary cadres and masses at the Shanghai Steel Plant have expressed their determination to seriously study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, grasp the class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and launch more fierce attacks on all class enemies.

Leaders of the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee have pointed out that Chairman Mao's brilliant latest instructions are a powerful ideological weapon for us to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must repeatedly study and deeply understand them, together with the broad revolutionary masses, oppose right conservatism, right splitism, right capitulationism, mountainism, and sectarianism, oppose two-faced people, resolutely repel the right "reversal" black wind, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Leaders of the Jilin Provincial and Changchun Municipal Revolutionary Committees held a symposium to study the experience of the revolutionary masses of various ethnic groups in Ningxia in closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and grasping the struggle between the two classes and two lines. They expressed their determination to constantly raise their awareness of class struggle and line struggle, resolutely smash the class enemies' schemes to restore capitalism, and further consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. Revolutionary workers at the Wuhan Enamelware Factory have said that we must carry forward the spirit of "not reaching the Great Wall is no hero," follow Chairman Mao's series of great teachings on conducting revolution under socialist conditions, firmly grasp the direction of the revolutionary struggle, and carry out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, politically, ideologically, and theoretically, to thoroughly criticize and expose the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents.

Revolutionary masses in Hebei, Jiangsu, Liaoning, Fujian, Sichuan, Yunnan, Anhui, Tibet, and other places, while joyously celebrating the birth of the Ningxia Revolutionary Committee, have all expressed their determination to more seriously study and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. At the celebration meeting held by the Shijiazhuang Municipal Revolutionary Committee and the local garrison on April 12, leaders of the Hebei Provincial Revolutionary Committee required all levels of revolutionary committees to transmit Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the broad revolutionary masses as quickly as possible, and closely combine them with the current class struggle, pushing the revolutionary criticism to a new high, politically, ideologically, and theoretically, thoroughly exposing and criticizing the counter-revolutionary crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the party and their agents in Hebei, and completely eliminating their poisonous influence.

Representatives of the proletarian revolutionary cadres from various places and counties participating in a study class in Hangzhou have said at today's symposium that we must learn from the proletarian revolutionary cadres in Ningxia, never forgetting the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines. We are determined, under the leadership of the provincial revolutionary committee, to use Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a weapon, oppose right opportunism and right splitism, consolidate and develop revolutionary unity and the three-in-one combination, carry out a thorough and sustained revolutionary criticism, and resolutely repel the class enemies' "reversal" black wind. Revolutionary workers at the Jiangxi Tractor Factory have said that we must firmly remember the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings, carry the current great political revolution through to the end, fight down and expose the Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the party who represent the interests of the Kuomintang reactionaries, that is, the bourgeoisie and landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and root out all spies and counter-revolutionaries, not stopping until complete victory is achieved!

The broad cadres and soldiers of the PLA Army, Navy, and Air Force, while celebrating the birth of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, with unlimited loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, have seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They have unanimously expressed their determination to firmly remember Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," enhance their awareness of class struggle and line struggle, heighten their revolutionary vigilance, firmly grasp their guns, together with the people of the entire country, strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, resolutely support and bravely defend the newly born revolutionary committees, and achieve new victories in the great struggle to defend socialist motherland and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.
