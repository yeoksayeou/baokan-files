The reactionary film *Spark of Revolt* portrays the victory of the Anshan-Hengyang Railway Workers' Strike, which shocked the world, as a purely economic struggle. This is a blatant promotion of the reactionary "economism," and a gross slander against the glorious revolutionary tradition of the Chinese working class!

From the day Chinese Khrushchev arrived in Anshan until the victory of the strike, he never conducted any class education or class struggle education among the workers. He only "connected emotionally" with the workers through small favors and bribed them with petty benefits. He claimed that this strike was "unrelated to political and military issues." In his article *The Development of the Chinese Workers' Movement in the Past Year*, he absurdly stated: "Economic struggles are inevitable for workers, and the development of economic struggles is the development of the Chinese workers' movement."

Chairman Mao taught us: "We must educate the trade union cadres and the workers to understand that they must not be content with immediate and partial benefits and forget the long-term interests of the working class. We must quickly elevate the workers' struggles from economic struggles to political struggles." By comparing these two statements, it is clear that Chinese Khrushchev intended to use "economism" to strangle the workers' movement!

The counter-revolutionary "economism" goods that Chinese Khrushchev peddled in Anshan back then are fully reflected in the film. He reduced the purpose of the workers' strike to "for the sake of survival, for the sake of eating." In essence, he used a few rotten coins to buy people's hearts, satisfying the workers' demands for "eating and living," and luring the working class onto the wrong path of only caring about "immediate and partial benefits." This way, he could "maintain the mine's production" and make the workers serve the capitalists forever, becoming obedient subjects of imperialism and the feudal ruling class!

Indeed, in the old society, we coal miners were the most exploited and oppressed. However, we understood that we lived a miserable life worse than cattle because of the three big mountains weighing on our heads, because we did not have political power in our hands! To completely liberate ourselves, the proletariat must unite under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, take the path of armed seizure of political power, overthrow the reactionary rule, and firmly grasp political power in the hands of the proletariat, establishing a socialist state under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Otherwise, even if the capitalists agreed to some of the workers' economic demands, it would only be because they were intimidated by the strength of the working class, taking temporary measures to maintain their shaky rule. As long as they hold the power and the guns, they can make you pay back double tomorrow for what they agreed to today. Therefore, as long as imperialism, warlords, bureaucrats, and capitalists exist, as long as the reactionary state power exists, they will suppress the workers, and the working class will not be able to escape the plight of oppression and exploitation. Economic struggles not only do not touch the reactionary ruling foundation, but they actually strengthen and maintain their reactionary rule.

Chinese Khrushchev, this great traitor of the workers' movement, used "economism" to corrupt the workers before liberation, desperately sabotaging the proletarian revolution and opposing the proletariat's seizure of political power. After liberation, he again vigorously promoted "exploitation is beneficial" and advocated "material incentives," attempting to turn us into ignorant fools who only focus on production and ignore politics, preparing for him to overthrow the proletarian dictatorship and restore capitalism in terms of ideology and organization. We must firmly hold high the banner of the revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize and expose this number one conspirator and opportunist in the party and his agents on all fronts, politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and fight him to the end! We will definitely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!

    让“经济主义”见鬼去吧！
    北京木城涧煤矿  张宝华
    反动电影《燎原》把震惊中外的安源路矿罢工的胜利，描写成是纯经济斗争的胜利，这是公开地宣扬反动的“经济主义”，这是对具有光荣革命传统的中国工人阶级的极大污蔑！
    中国赫鲁晓夫从到安源那天起，直至罢工胜利，从未见他向工人群众进行阶级和阶级斗争的教育，只是从生活上“联络感情”，用小恩小惠笼络人心。他把这次罢工说成“与政治军事问题不发生关系”。他还在《一年来中国职工运动的发展》中胡说什么：“经济斗争，工人在所必争，经济斗争之发展，即为中国职工运动之发展。”
    毛主席教导我们：“应当向工会同志和工人群众进行教育，使他们懂得，决不可只看到眼前的片面的福利而忘记了工人阶级的远大利益”，必须“把群众斗争从经济斗争迅速提高到政治斗争”。对比一下，就可以清楚地看出中国赫鲁晓夫妄想用“经济主义”扼杀工人运动的狼子野心！
    中国赫鲁晓夫当年在安源所贩卖的反革命经济主义黑货，在影片中充分地体现出来。他把工人罢工的目的只归结为“为了活命，为了吃饭”，说穿了，就是用几个臭钱收买人心，满足工人
  “吃饭活命”的要求，把工人阶级引诱到只顾
  “眼前的片面的福利”的邪路上去。这样，以便
  “维持矿局生产”，永远为资本家服务，做帝国主义和封建统治阶级的“顺民”！
    的确，在旧社会，我们煤矿工人受剥削最重，受压迫最深。但是，我们懂得，那时所以过着牛马不如的悲惨生活，并不是什么“经济上之不发展”，而是因为三座大山压在头顶，因为我们手中没有政权！为了彻底翻身得解放，无产阶级只有团结起来，在共产党和毛主席的领导下，走上武装夺取政权的道路，推翻反动统治，把政权牢牢掌握在无产阶级自己手里，建立一个无产阶级专政的社会主义国家。否则，即使资本家答应了工人的一些“经济要求”，那也只不过是因为他们慑于工人阶级的强大，为了维持摇摇欲坠的统治基础，采取的缓兵措施而已。印把子、枪杆子在他们手中握着，今天答应了，明天可以加倍让你偿还。因此，只要帝国主义、军阀、官僚、资本家还存在，反动的国家政权还存在，他们还会镇压工人，工人阶级就摆脱不了受压迫受剥削的困境。经济斗争不但不会触动反动统治基础的一根毫毛，反而恰恰加强和维护了他们的反动统治。
    中国赫鲁晓夫这个工人运动的大叛徒，解放前用“经济主义”腐蚀工人，拚命破坏无产阶级革命，反对无产阶级夺取政权。解放后又大肆宣扬“剥削有功”，鼓吹“物质刺激”，妄图把我们变为埋头生产不问政治的糊涂虫，为他颠覆无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义进行思想上和组织上的准备。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，把这个党内头号野心家、阴谋家及其在各条战线上的代理人，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批深批透，斗倒斗臭！誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
