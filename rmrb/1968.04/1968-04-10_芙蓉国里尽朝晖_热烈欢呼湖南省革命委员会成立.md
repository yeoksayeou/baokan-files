Under the inspiration of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and amidst the excellent situation both internationally and domestically, the Hunan Provincial Revolutionary Committee has been born. This is a great joy for the people of Hunan! It is also a great joy for the people of the entire nation!

We extend our highest revolutionary greetings to the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Hunan, the 38 million revolutionary people of Hunan, and the People's Liberation Army stationed in Hunan!

Hunan is a revolutionary holy land that the Chinese people and the people of the world yearn for.

The great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin have shown immense concern for the proletarian cultural revolution in Hunan. At this crucial moment in the class struggle, Chairman Mao personally visited Hunan, providing important instructions. On this occasion of celebrating the establishment of the Hunan Provincial Revolutionary Committee, we sincerely wish the great leader Chairman Mao eternal life!

The great leader Chairman Mao has instructed: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are aimed at seizing power and consolidating power." Chairman Mao has recently pointed out profoundly: The proletarian cultural revolution is essentially a political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under socialist conditions, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the revolutionary masses it leads and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.

Hunan has always been an important battlefield for the fierce struggle between revolution and counter-revolution. The Chinese Khrushchev and other top renegades within the party, along with their agents in Hunan, represent the interests of the Kuomintang reactionaries, that is, the bourgeoisie and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. They have placed their trusted followers in Hunan, cultivated their henchmen, opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, vigorously promoted the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and attempted to restore capitalism. The vigorous proletarian cultural revolution has declared their doom. This small clique of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist-roaders who have infiltrated our party, along with the counter-revolutionaries who have sneaked into our revolutionary ranks, are unwilling to face their demise and conspire with the remaining Kuomintang reactionary remnants in society to make a desperate struggle. However, the workers of Hunan, who are loyal to Chairman Mao, the broad revolutionary masses, and the People's Liberation Army stationed in Hunan, remember the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," seriously implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, are clear-headed and spirited, and have fought a resolute struggle against the class enemy, repeatedly striking them down, finally shattering their various plots, and achieving decisive victory in the proletarian cultural revolution in Hunan.

The closer the proletarian cultural revolution gets to overall victory, the more the counter-revolutionary forces will desperately struggle against the revolutionary forces. After the establishment of the Hunan Provincial Revolutionary Committee, it should, according to Chairman Mao's instruction to "organize a revolutionary leadership corps that is connected with the masses," build the revolutionary committee into a revolutionary command center that emphasizes proletarian politics, has proletarian revolutionary authority, and can lead the revolutionary masses to fight against the enemies of the proletariat.

We hope that the Hunan Provincial Revolutionary Committee will grasp the overall direction of the struggle and never forget the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. It should continue to mobilize the broad masses, adhere to the proletarian revolutionary line, and carry out the revolutionary criticism deeply and persistently. It should launch continuous attacks on the top renegade clique within the party, headed by the Chinese Khrushchev, and their agents in Hunan. It should thoroughly expose the bourgeois reactionary line. It should strongly criticize the rightist wind of rehabilitation. It should strengthen the awareness of the enemy, keep their eyes sharp, and be good at distinguishing those who pretend to support the revolution but actually oppose it, thoroughly smashing all their evil plots to shake and split the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. It should strengthen proletarian party spirit, criticize bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, overthrow mountainheadism, sectarianism, and rightist splitism, and oppose two-faced people. It should be good at distinguishing between enemy contradictions and contradictions among the people. Against the enemy, it should strike accurately, strike hard, and strike steadily. For our own people, for revolutionary comrades who have made mistakes, whether they are revolutionary masses or revolutionary cadres, it should help them rectify their mistakes, learn from the past, and cure the sickness to save the patient.

"Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman, doing revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." The Hunan Provincial Revolutionary Committee and all the military and civilian personnel in the province should regard learning, implementing, propagating, and defending Mao Zedong Thought as their most sacred duty, and carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought more extensively and deeply. They should firmly stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, criticize and repudiate revisionism, and continuously consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, do a good job in the struggle-criticism-transformation of their units, further implement Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions, and carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end.

The land of hibiscus is bathed in morning light. We are confident that the heroic sons and daughters of Hunan, who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, will, under the radiance of the red sun, seize the excellent situation and ride the east wind, and turn Hunan Province into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought!

    芙蓉国里尽朝晖
    ——热烈欢呼湖南省革命委员会成立
    《人民日报》《解放军报》社论
    在毛主席最新指示的鼓舞下，在国际国内一片大好形势下，湖南省革命委员会诞生了。这是湖南人民的大喜事！也是全国人民的大喜事！
    我们向湖南省无产阶级革命派、湖南三千八百万革命人民和中国人民解放军驻湖南部队，致以崇高的战斗的敬礼！
    湖南，是中国人民和世界人民向往的革命圣地。
    伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席，对湖南的无产阶级文化大革命，给予了巨大的关怀。在阶级斗争的重要时刻，毛主席又亲临湖南视察，作了重要的指示。在庆祝湖南省革命委员会成立的时候，我们最衷心地祝愿伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！
    伟大领袖毛主席指示：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”毛主席最近又深刻地指出：无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。
    湖南，历来是革命和反革命激烈搏斗的重要战场。中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派以及他们在湖南的代理人，代表了国民党反动派即资产阶级和地、富、反、坏、右的利益，在湖南安插亲信，培植爪牙，反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，大力推行反革命修正主义路线，妄想复辟资本主义。轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命，宣告了他们的末日。这一小撮混进我们党里的叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派，钻进我们革命队伍里面的反革命分子，不甘心自己的灭亡，同社会上残留下来的国民党反动派余孽相勾结，妄图进行垂死挣扎。但是，无限忠于毛主席的湖南工人阶级、广大革命人民和驻湖南的人民解放军部队，牢记伟大领袖毛主席关于“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，认真落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，心明眼亮，精神抖擞，同阶级敌人进行了针锋相对的斗争，一次又一次地给了敌人以坚决的打击，终于粉碎了他们的各种阴谋，取得了湖南省无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利。
    无产阶级文化大革命越接近全面胜利，反革命力量必然越要同革命力量作拚死的斗争。湖南省革命委员会成立之后，要按照毛主席关于“组织起一个革命化的联系群众的领导班子”的教导，把革命委员会建设成为突出无产阶级政治、有无产阶级革命权威、能够率领革命群众对无产阶级的敌人进行战斗的革命司令部。
    我们希望湖南省革命委员会，要掌握斗争的大方向，时刻都不要忘记两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争。要继续发动广大群众，坚持无产阶级革命路线，把革命的大批判深入地持久地开展下去，向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大一小撮走资派及其在湖南的代理人，继续发动进攻。要充分地揭露资产阶级反动路线。要有力地批判右倾翻案的妖风。要加强敌情观念，擦亮眼睛，善于辨别那些伪装拥护革命而实际反对革命的分子，彻底粉碎他们动摇和分裂以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的一切罪恶阴谋。要加强无产阶级党性，批判资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，打倒山头主义、宗派主义，打倒右倾分裂主义，反对两面派。要善于区分敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾。对敌人要打得准，打得狠，打得稳。对自己人，对犯了错误的革命同志，不论是革命群众或者革命的领导干部，都要帮助他们整风，惩前毖后，治病救人。
      “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”湖南省革命委员会和全省军民，要把学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛泽东思想，作为自己最神圣的职责，更加广泛、更加深入地开展活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动，继续大力办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。要坚定地站在毛主席的革命路线上，斗私，批修，不断巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合，搞好本单位的斗批改，进一步落实毛主席的一系列最新指示，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    芙蓉国里尽朝晖。我们深信，无限忠于毛主席的湖南英雄儿女，一定能够在红太阳的光辉照耀下，趁大好形势，乘浩荡东风，把湖南省办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校！
