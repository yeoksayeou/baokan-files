The editorial "A Great Inspiration for the Common Struggle Against American Imperialism" was published in the front-page headline of the organ of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania, "The Voice of the People," on April 20. The editorial warmly acclaims and highly praises Chairman Mao's statement in support of the struggle of American Negroes against violence. The full text of the editorial is as follows:

Chairman Mao's statement in support of the struggle of American Negroes is a powerful inspiration and great encouragement for American Negroes and the American working class, and for the workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals of all countries and nations to wage a more violent and more resolute struggle against American imperialism. His correct and acute analysis of the situation of American Negroes and their struggle for liberation far transcends the scope of this issue. Comrade Mao Zedong, as a great and steadfast revolutionary and an outstanding Marxist-Leninist, has revealed and analyzed the fundamental contradictions of American imperialism today, pointing out the correct revolutionary path that will not only liberate the Negroes but also the entire American working class from capitalist exploitation and the imperialist yoke.

American imperialism is the most aggressive imperialism in history. It pursues a savage policy of racial segregation, ruthless exploitation of the working people, and oppression of the peoples of various countries, both at home and abroad. The rebellion and resistance of American Negroes show that they are increasingly aware that to be liberated from the imperialist system, they must destroy imperialism. Martin Luther King, the leader of the Negroes, was a pacifist. He had hoped to achieve Negro liberation without the use of violence. Even such a utopianist was treacherously killed by American racists. The assassination of Martin Luther King has shattered the illusions of millions of Negroes that the American bosses will have a change of heart and willingly allow Negro liberation. The current struggle of American Negroes and the struggles of recent years show that as long as the capitalist system exists, they will not be free from exploitation and will not win freedom. They are not mere protesters with bare hands but stand up like warriors. This fact is of great significance. It shows that in the fierce struggle against imperialists and racists, Negroes are politically awakening and mobilizing themselves to fight for their rights without regard to sacrifice. This marks an important turning point in the struggle of American Negroes for liberation, freedom, and rights, and the beginning of a new era in their struggle.

However, it is self-evident that the struggle of Negroes alone, even if it is heroic and resolute, is not enough to fundamentally solve the Negro problem. Comrade Mao Zedong correctly emphasizes that the struggle of American Negroes will inevitably combine with the American workers' movement and ultimately put an end to the evil rule of the American monopolistic bourgeoisie. American workers, whether white or black, have common interests and common goals, which is to overthrow the reactionary rule of the bourgeoisie and destroy the colonialist and imperialist system.

Chairman Mao logically and dialectically reveals from what angle we should view, interpret, and understand the new storm of revolutionary violence against imperialist racism by American Negroes, and how to correctly evaluate the great international significance of this new storm. Chairman Mao's statement says: "The struggle of American Negroes is not only a struggle for freedom and liberation by the oppressed and exploited Negroes but also a new call to arms for the entire oppressed and exploited American people against the brutal rule of the monopolistic bourgeoisie. It is a great support and inspiration for the struggle of the peoples of the world against American imperialism and for the struggle of the Vietnamese people against American imperialism."

Chairman Mao's statement expresses the strong support of the great 700 million people of China for American Negroes, which will inspire and encourage the struggle of American Negroes against American imperialism. At a time when American Negroes need the support of revolutionary forces and peoples of the world more than ever, the fighting solidarity of the Chinese people and the Communist Party of China has enhanced the fighting spirit and confidence in victory of American Negroes.

The correct position of the People's Republic of China on the anti-imperialist struggle of American Negroes once again shows the great revolutionary role that the People's Republic of China plays in the world today. All peoples who are struggling for national and social liberation and fighting against imperialism and reactionaries will always receive the sincere, fraternal, and reliable support of the Chinese people and the Communist Party of China led by Comrade Mao Zedong. They are inspired and encouraged to strengthen their revolutionary struggles and fight resolutely until they completely defeat the enemy.

Chairman Mao calls on the workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and all those who want to oppose American imperialism in various countries to take action and give strong support to the struggle of American Negroes! This call has historical significance and will be warmly and enthusiastically welcomed in the ranks of the great army fighting against imperialism and reactionaries for national liberation and the victory of socialism.

Revolutionaries in various places will respond to Chairman Mao's call by expanding and strengthening the struggle against imperialism and various exploitative systems and for the liberation of oppressed peoples and nations. Revolutionaries in various countries are continuously and powerfully striking at American imperialism, exposing and opposing the aggressive plans and deceptive policies of American imperialism. This is not only for the benefit of their own people but also helps the American workers' movement and the American Negro movement to destroy the head of the world reactionaries, American imperialism, in its lair. This is beneficial to the liberation of the peoples of various countries and to the world revolution of the present era. As Chairman Mao pointed out, the struggle of American Negroes is also a part of the world revolution of the present era. For this reason, Chairman Mao's statement is a new and great inspiration to the peoples of the world, making them more closely united and more resolutely opposed to the common enemy, American imperialism, colonialism, and the oppressive reactionaries of various countries.

It is a great inspiration for strengthening the struggle against revisionism led by the most intimate ally of American imperialism and the most loyal supporter of American imperialism's aggressive plans against the freedom and independence of the peoples of various countries, the Soviet revisionists. It will help the new Marxist-Leninist forces and the true revolutionaries of various countries to further strengthen their ranks and more resolutely oppose imperialism and revisionism until they are thoroughly eliminated.

Chairman Mao says: "The thorough collapse of colonialism, imperialism, and all exploitative systems, and the thorough liberation of all oppressed peoples and nations, is not far off." This fills the peoples of the five continents, who are waging a great and comprehensive struggle against imperialism and its allies today, with optimism, strengthens their confidence in victory, and strengthens their confidence in the inevitable and brilliant socialist future.

The Albanian people warmly acclaim Chairman Mao's statement in support of the struggle of American Negroes and regard it as an outstanding contribution made by the Chinese people and the Communist Party of China to the revolutionary struggle of the peoples of various countries against the common enemy, American imperialism. It is a new inspiration for the peoples of various countries to tirelessly struggle and work for the great and invincible cause of revolution and socialism.

    对反对美帝国主义的共同斗争的巨大鼓舞
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央机关报《人民之声报》二十日社论
    新华社地拉那二十日电　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央机关报《人民之声报》二十日在头版头条地位发表题为《对反对美帝国主义的共同斗争的巨大鼓舞》的社论，热烈欢呼和高度评价毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明。社论全文如下：
    毛泽东主席支持美国黑人斗争的声明，是对美国黑人和美国工人阶级，对各国和各民族工人、农民和革命知识分子更加猛烈、更加坚决地同美帝国主义进行斗争的又一个强有力的鼓舞和巨大的激励。他对美国黑人的状况及其解放斗争所作的正确和敏锐的分析，远远超过了这个问题的范围。毛泽东同志作为一个伟大的、始终不渝的革命家和杰出的马克思列宁主义者，揭示和剖析了美帝国主义当前的基本矛盾，指出了不仅必将使黑人，而且使整个美国工人阶级取得解放、摆脱资本主义剥削和帝国主义枷锁的正确的革命道路。
    美帝国主义是有史以来最富于侵略性的帝国主义。它在国内外推行种族隔离、残酷剥削劳动人民和压迫各国人民的野蛮政策。美国黑人的造反和反抗表明，他们正在日益觉悟到，要从帝国主义制度下解放出来，必须消灭帝国主义。黑人领袖马丁·路德·金是个和平主义者。他曾希望不使用暴力来达到黑人的解放。即使这样一个乌托邦主义者，美国的种族主义者还是阴险地把他杀死了。马丁·路德·金的被杀使成百万黑人认为美国大老板会发善心，并心甘情愿地允许黑人解放的种种幻想破灭了。美国黑人的这次斗争和近几年来的斗争表明，只要还存在资本主义制度，他们就不可能免遭剥削，就不可能赢得自由。他们不是徒手的抗议者，而是象战士一样站起来。这一事实是有重大意义的。这一点表明，在反对帝国主义者和种族主义者的剧烈斗争中，黑人在政治上正在觉悟，正在为赢得自己的权利而不顾牺牲地动员起来，这标志着美国黑人斗争的一个重要转折点，标志着他们争取解放、自由和权利的斗争的新时代的开端。
    但是，不言而喻，要彻底解决黑人问题，仅有黑人的斗争是不够的，即使这种斗争是英勇的和坚定的。毛泽东同志十分正确地强调指出，美国黑人斗争必将同美国工人运动相结合，最终结束美国垄断资产阶级的罪恶统治。美国工人，无论是白色人种工人，或者是黑色人种工人，有着共同的利益和共同的目标，这就是推翻资产阶级的反动统治，摧毁殖民主义和帝国主义制度。
    毛泽东主席合乎逻辑地和辩证地揭示出应该从什么角度来看待、解释和理解美国黑人反对帝国主义种族主义者的反革命暴力的新风暴，应该怎样正确评价这一新风暴的重大国际意义。毛泽东主席的声明说：“美国黑人的斗争，不仅是被剥削、被压迫的黑人争取自由解放的斗争，而且是整个被剥削、被压迫的美国人民反对垄断资产阶级残暴统治的新号角。它对于全世界人民反对美帝国主义的斗争，对于越南人民反对美帝国主义的斗争，是一个巨大的支援和鼓舞。”
    毛泽东主席的声明表达了伟大的七亿中国人民对美国黑人的有力支持，将鼓舞和激励美国黑人反对美帝国主义的斗争。正当美国黑人比任何时候更需要全世界革命力量和人民的支持时，中国人民和中国共产党的战斗声援增强了美国黑人的战斗勇气和胜利信心。
    人民中国对待美国黑人反帝斗争的正确立场，再次表明人民中国今天在世界上所起的伟大的革命作用。一切正在进行争取民族和社会解放、并同帝国主义和反动派斗争的人民，永远得到中国人民和以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的真诚的、兄弟般的和可靠的支持，他们得到新的鼓舞和激励，去加强他们的革命斗争，坚决地进行战斗，直到彻底战胜敌人。
    毛泽东主席呼吁世界各国的工人、农民、革命知识分子和一切愿意反对美帝国主义的人们，行动起来，给予美国黑人的斗争以强大的声援！这一呼吁具有历史性的意义，必将在反对帝国主义和反动派、争取民族解放和社会主义胜利的大军的行列中，得到热烈的和热情的欢迎。
    各地的革命者将以扩大和加强反对帝国主义和各种剥削制度、争取被压迫人民和被压迫民族的解放的斗争，来响应毛泽东主席的号召。各国革命者在各地不断有力地打击美帝国主义，揭露和反对美帝国主义的侵略计划和欺骗政策。这不仅仅是为了本国人民的利益，而且也有助于美国工人运动和美国黑人运动，以便把世界反动派的头子美帝国主义消灭在它的巢穴里。这有利于各国人民的解放，有利于当代的世界革命。正如毛泽东主席所指出的，美国黑人的斗争也是当代世界革命的一个组成部分。正因为如此，毛泽东主席的声明是对全世界人民的新的、巨大的鼓舞，使他们更加紧密地团结起来，更加坚决地反对共同的敌人美帝国主义、殖民主义和各国反动派的压迫。
    它是对加强反对以苏修——美帝国主义的最亲密的盟友和美帝国主义反对各国人民的自由与独立的侵略计划的最忠实的支持者——为首的修正主义斗争的巨大鼓舞。它将有助于新的马克思列宁主义力量、各国真正的革命者进一步加强自己的队伍，更坚决地反对帝国主义和反对修正主义，直到把它们彻底消灭。
    毛主席说：“殖民主义、帝国主义和一切剥削制度的彻底崩溃，世界上一切被压迫人民、被压迫民族的彻底翻身，已经为期不远了。”这使今天正在进行反对帝国主义及其同盟者的伟大的、全面的斗争的五大洲人民，充满了乐观主义精神，增强了他们的胜利信心，增强了他们对必然到来的和光辉灿烂的社会主义未来的信心。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民热烈欢呼毛泽东主席支持美国黑人斗争的声明，并把它看作是中国人民和中国共产党对各国人民反对共同的敌人美帝国主义的革命斗争所作出的杰出贡献，是对各国人民为伟大的和不可战胜的革命和社会主义事业进行不倦的斗争和劳动的新的鼓舞。
