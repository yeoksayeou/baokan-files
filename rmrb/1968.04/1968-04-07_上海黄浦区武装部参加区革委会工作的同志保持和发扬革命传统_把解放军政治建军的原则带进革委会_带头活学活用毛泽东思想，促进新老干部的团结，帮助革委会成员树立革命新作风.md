Comrades from the Huangpu District Military Subdistrict in Shanghai, who have been participating in the work of the district revolutionary committee for over a year, have brought the principles of the People's Liberation Army's political construction into the revolutionary committee. They have led the way in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, promoted unity among new and old cadres, and helped the members of the revolutionary committee establish a new revolutionary style.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Shanghai on the 6th, comrades from the Huangpu District People's Armed Forces Department have, in the more than a year since they participated in the work of the district revolutionary committee, brought the political construction principles of the People's Liberation Army into the revolutionary committee, passed them on to new and old cadres, and learned from each other with revolutionary cadres and representatives of the revolutionary masses, compensating for each other's weaknesses and strengths. This has played a very good role in promoting the revolutionization of the revolutionary committee.

During the struggle of the proletarian revolutionary factions to seize power from a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, comrades from the Huangpu District People's Armed Forces Department forged deep bonds of friendship with the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres. On March 20th of last year, the district revolutionary committee was established, and some comrades from the armed forces department participated in the work of the revolutionary committee. They played a very good role in the revolutionary committee.

First, they led everyone to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and striving to build the revolutionary committee into a leadership cadre that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and closely connected with the masses.

In the process of revolutionizing the revolutionary committee, military representatives paid special attention to leading the way in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, transforming their worldview, and promoting ideological revolutionization. Under the influence of the military representatives, the revolutionary committee established an unshakable study system. Many committee members worked late into the night but still insisted on self-study. Everyone learned and applied what they studied, fiercely attacking the "self" and firmly establishing the "public," continuously transforming their worldviews. Some revolutionary cadres participating in the revolutionary committee recognized during their studies that having the "fear" character meant being disloyal to Chairman Mao. They overcame the "fear" character and, with the support, encouragement, and help of the military representatives and revolutionary mass representatives, established the "dare" character. They dared to go to the front lines of class struggle, dared to actively handle problems, and took on responsibilities.

After the revolutionary committee was established, many problems needed to be solved urgently. At that time, some members of the revolutionary committee were busy with administrative work all day, receiving visitors and handling specific problems. Although they were busy, their work was not done well, and the masses had complaints. The military representatives noticed this problem and immediately discussed it with other members of the revolutionary committee. They decided to hold a Mao Zedong Thought study class to study Chairman Mao's statements on politics being the commander and the soul, as well as his opposition to pure military views. During the study, everyone learned, discussed, and checked themselves, realizing that after the proletarian revolutionary factions seized power, class struggle still existed sharply, and the focus of the struggle was still the power issue. Without grasping Mao Zedong Thought as the fundamental issue, without grasping class struggle, without grasping the revolution, the revolutionary committee would lose its vitality, lose its direction, and be the greatest disloyalty to Chairman Mao. This gave everyone the first lesson on emphasizing proletarian politics.

The idea of grasping the fundamentals was strengthened, but for a period, the revolutionary committee still did not grasp class struggle tightly and was weak in leading the revolutionary criticism and denunciation. At this time, the military representatives again suggested holding a Mao Zedong Thought study class to study Chairman Mao's statements on class and class struggle and the latest instructions since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This made everyone further realize that leading the masses to grasp class struggle and continuously deepen the revolutionary criticism and denunciation was Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and the current direction of the struggle, which was the greatest politics. Forgetting this fundamental issue meant forgetting the direction of the struggle and not emphasizing proletarian politics. On the basis of raising awareness, the military representatives, along with other standing committee members of the revolutionary committee, carried Mao Zedong's works to the front lines of class struggle. They studied and fought side by side with the proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad revolutionary masses, fighting three hard battles. The first battle was against China's Khrushchev. The second battle was against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. The third battle was to expose the cover of class struggle and fight against class enemies. After these three hard battles, the relationship between the leadership and the masses was further strengthened, and the newly born revolutionary committee established its authority among the masses and was continuously consolidated.

Second, they strove to promote unity among the members of the revolutionary committee, learning from each other, caring for each other, supporting each other, and compensating for each other's weaknesses and strengths, achieving what Chairman Mao taught: "to prevent the old from being separated from the masses and to train the young," building the revolutionary committee into a strong and powerful combat command center.

In the early days of the revolutionary committee, there were still some ideological gaps between the representatives of revolutionary cadres and the representatives of revolutionary masses. Some mass representatives considered themselves "old rebels" and did not trust and respect the old cadres enough; some old cadres were afraid of making mistakes again and were somewhat hesitant in their work. Therefore, the collective leadership role could not be fully played, affecting the combat effectiveness of the revolutionary committee.

The military representatives, in response to some of the problems between new and old cadres, enthusiastically studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions with everyone, making everyone realize that whether the three representatives could unite closely on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought was a major issue related to whether Chairman Mao's principle of the "three-in-one combination" was truly implemented. They decided to fiercely fight against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and strengthen proletarian party spirit. The three leaders, with the committee chairman at the forefront, took the lead in exposing their personal issues in a public meeting and immediately listened to the criticisms of the masses, which had a great impact on everyone. Everyone excitedly said: "The relationship between new cadres and old cadres is not coordinated, which is actually a manifestation of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism. Having factionalism means not being able to hold power well and use power well, which is the greatest disloyalty to Chairman Mao." On this basis, the military representatives, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "carry out heart-to-heart talks, which is a good method," had heart-to-heart talks with new and old cadres, specifically helping them resolve their ideological knots. Some new cadres often saw more mistakes and shortcomings in old cadres and less of their strengths and advantages. The military representatives, when talking with new cadres, repeatedly propagated Chairman Mao's cadre policy, helping them to fully and historically view revolutionary cadres, respect revolutionary cadres, and learn from their strengths and advantages. Some old cadres could not tolerate some shortcomings in the progress of new cadres. The military representatives, when talking with old cadres, focused on helping them enthusiastically support revolutionary new cadres. The military representatives also organized a thought exchange meeting between new and old cadres, guiding everyone to open their hearts and have heart-to-heart talks, which had a good effect.

To make new and old cadres more united, achieving old leading new and new promoting old, the military representatives also launched the "one helps one, one pair of reds" activity within the revolutionary committee, making the relationship between new and old cadres closer, and fully utilizing the strengths of new and old cadres and military cadres. This consolidated the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" and enhanced the combat effectiveness of the revolutionary committee.

Third, using Chairman Mao's instruction to "ensure that comrades continue to maintain a humble, prudent, unarrogant, and unhurried style, and ensure that comrades continue to maintain a style of hard struggle" as a weapon, the military representatives brought the hard-working style and the style of closely connecting with the masses of the People's Liberation Army into the revolutionary committee. This made the members of the revolutionary committee highly vigilant against the attacks of bourgeois sugar-coated bullets and forever preserve the revolutionary youth of the proletariat.

After the establishment of the revolutionary committee in this district, some young cadres, due to hearing too many praises, had some bourgeois thoughts growing in their minds. Revolutionary masses, seeing this situation, sharply warned them not to be hit by "bullets" wrapped in sugar coats. The military representatives immediately seized this ideological sprout, suggesting to hold a Mao Zedong Thought study class, focusing on studying Chairman Mao's "Report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China," and studying with everyone, going deep into the masses, and widely listening to the criticisms of the masses. During the study, some people deeply realized that if they were not vigilant, there was a danger of "changing color," and immediately took action, publicly checking their lives of special treatment in big-character posters, and decided to devote all their energy to the revolutionary cause.

After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, whether it could always insist on the mass line and maintain a blood-and-flesh connection with the masses was a major issue related to whether the proletarian regime would change color. Most of the cadres in the revolutionary committee could "both be an official and a common person," carrying their backpacks and Mao Zedong's works, living among the masses every day. But there were still a few comrades who spent less time among the masses and had poor self-awareness. The military representatives, along with them, used Chairman Mao's instruction to "completely and thoroughly serve the people" as a weapon, criticized the bad style of the bourgeoisie spread by China's Khrushchev, and established good styles such as believing in the masses, relying on the masses, consulting with the masses on matters, humbly listening to the opinions of the masses, and accepting the supervision of the masses in the revolutionary committee.

After this district's revolutionary committee achieved some results in its work, some comrades became arrogant and complacent and stopped progressing. However, in the "learn from each other, help each other, catch up, and surpass" mass movement, this district did not rank at the forefront, and some comrades became anxious. The military representatives and the leading members of the revolutionary committee discovered this problem and, with the topic of "why be arrogant after winning and passive after losing," held a Mao Zedong Thought study class to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought. In the study class, everyone laid out the manifestations of "arrogance," dug out the roots of "arrogance," found the harms of "arrogance," and realized that "arrogance" was a corrosive agent that affected the development of the revolutionary cause. Everyone deepened their hatred for "arrogance," immediately took action, and went to an advanced unit five times to find the gap, from phenomenon to essence, from external causes to internal causes, becoming more profound each time, touching the soul step by step, studying to a higher level, and catching up with the advanced.

    上海黄浦区武装部参加区革委会工作的同志保持和发扬革命传统
    把解放军政治建军的原则带进革委会
    带头活学活用毛泽东思想，促进新老干部的团结，帮助革委会成员树立革命新作风
    据新华社上海六日电上海市黄浦区人民武装部的同志在参加区革命委员会工作的一年多来，把人民解放军的政治建军方针原则带进革委会，传给新老干部，并同革命干部的代表和革命群众的代表互相学习，取长补短，对推动革委会的革命化起了很好的作用。
    在无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资派的夺权斗争中，黄浦区人民武装部的同志们与广大革命群众、革命干部结下了深厚的战斗友谊。去年三月二十日，区革命委员会成立，武装部的一部分同志参加了革委会的工作。他们在革命委员会中起了很好的作用。
    第一，带领大家活学活用毛泽东思想，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，努力把革命委员会建设成为无限忠于毛主席的密切联系群众的革命化的领导班子。
    在革委会革命化建设的过程中，军队代表特别重视带头活学活用毛泽东思想，改造世界观，促进思想革命化。在军队代表的带动下，革委会建立了雷打不动的学习制度。许多常委工作到深夜，还坚持自学。大家学了就用，猛攻“私”字，大立“公”字，不断地改造自己的世界观。有些参加革委会的革命干部在学习中，认识到存在“怕”字，就是对毛主席不忠，从而克服了“怕”字，并在解放军代表、革命群众代表的支持、鼓励和帮助下，树立了“敢”字，敢到阶级斗争的第一线去，敢于主动处理问题，担起责任。
    革命委员会建立后，许许多多的问题急需解决。当时革委会部分成员，终日忙于事务性的工作，接待来访，处理具体问题，虽然很忙，但是工作没有搞好，群众又有意见。军队代表察觉到这个问题，立即与革委会的其他成员研究，决定举办毛泽东思想学习班，学习毛主席关于政治是统帅，是灵魂以及反对单纯军事观点的论述。学习中，大家边学边议边对照检查，认识到：无产阶级革命派夺权以后，阶级斗争还是尖锐地存在着，斗争的焦点仍然是政权问题。不抓毛泽东思想这个根本，不抓阶级斗争，不抓革命，就会使革委会失去生命力，就会迷失方向，就是对毛主席的最大不忠。这样，给大家上了突出无产阶级政治的第一课。
    狠抓根本的观念加强了，但有一段时间，革委会对阶级斗争仍然抓得不紧，对革命大批判领导无力。这时，军队的代表又建议举办毛泽东思想学习班，学习毛主席关于阶级、阶级斗争的论述和无产阶级文化大革命以来的最新指示，使大家进一步认识到：带领群众狠抓阶级斗争，不断深入开展革命大批判，是毛主席的伟大战略部署，是当前的斗争大方向，是最大的政治。忘记了这个根本，就是忘记了斗争大方向，就是不突出无产阶级政治。在提高认识的基础上，军队的代表与革委会其他常委一起带着毛主席著作深入阶级斗争第一线，与无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众一起学习，并肩作战，打了三场硬仗。第一场是向中国赫鲁晓夫开火。第二场是向资产阶级、小资产阶级派性开火。第三场大揭阶级斗争盖子，向阶级敌人开火。经过这三场硬仗，进一步密切了领导和群众的关系，使新生的革命委员会在群众中树立了威信，不断得到巩固。
    第二，努力促进革委会成员的团结，互相学习，互相爱护，互相支持，取长补短，做到毛主席所教导的那样，“使前辈人不脱离群众，使青年人得到锻炼”，把革命委员会建设成精悍有力的战斗指挥部。
    革命委员会建立初期，革命干部的代表和革命群众的代表思想上还存在一些隔阂。有些群众代表以“老造反”自居，对老干部信任和尊重不够；有些老干部怕再犯错误，工作上有些缩手缩脚。因此，集体领导作用不能很好发挥，影响了革委会的战斗力。
    军队的代表针对新老干部之间存在的一些问题，满腔热情地与大家共同学习毛主席的最新指示，使大家认识到，三方面的代表能不能在毛泽东思想基础上紧密团结，是关系到毛主席的革命“三结合”原则是不是真正得到贯彻的大问题，决心狠斗资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，增强无产阶级党性。以革委会主任为首的三位新老领导干部在群众大会上带头亮私斗私，并当场听取群众的批评意见，对大家触动很大。大家激动地说：“新干部与老干部关系不协调，这实际上是资产阶级、小资产阶级派性的一种表现。有了派性就不能掌好权，用好权，这是对毛主席最大的不忠。”在这个基础上，军队代表遵照毛主席“开展谈心活动，这个方法很好”的教导，与新老干部促膝谈心，具体帮助他们解开思想疙瘩。有些新干部对老干部往往看他们过去犯的错误和缺点多，看他们的长处和优点少。军队代表在同新干部谈心时，就反复宣传毛主席的干部政策，帮助他们全面地、历史地看待革命干部，尊重革命干部，学习他们的长处和优点。有些老干部对新干部前进中的一些缺点看不惯。军队代表在同老干部谈心时，就着重帮助他们满腔热忱地支持革命的新干部。军队代表还组织了一次新老干部的思想见面会，引导大家推心置腹，促膝谈心，效果很好。
    为了使新老干部更加团结一致，做到老带新，新促老，军队代表还在革委会内部开展了“一帮一，一对红”的活动，使新老干部的关系更加密切，新老干部和军队干部的特长得到充分的发挥，巩固了革命的“三结合”，增强了革命委员会的战斗力。
    第三，以毛主席“务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风”的教导为武器，把解放军艰苦奋斗的作风和密切联系群众的作风传到革委会，使革委会成员高度警惕资产阶级糖衣炮弹的攻击，永葆无产阶级革命青春。
    这个区的革委会建立以后，个别青年干部由于听表扬多了，头脑里资产阶级思想有所滋长。革命群众看到这种情况，尖锐地告诫他们不要被糖衣裹着的“炮弹”所打中。军队代表立即抓住这个思想苗子，建议举办毛泽东思想学习班，着重学习了毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》，并和大家一起深入群众，广泛听取群众的批评。学习中，有些人深刻地认识到，如果不警惕，就有“改变颜色”的危险，因此，立即行动起来，用大字报公开检查了自己生活特殊化，决心把全部精力投身到革命事业中去。
    革命委员会建立以后，能不能永远坚持群众路线，与群众保持血肉联系，是关系到无产阶级政权会不会变色的大问题。革委会的大部分干部都能“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”，成天背着背包，带着毛主席著作，生活在群众之中。但也有个别同志，深入群众时间少，自觉性差。军队代表又和他们一起以毛主席“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的教导为武器，批判中国赫鲁晓夫散布的资产阶级的坏作风，在革委会中树立起相信群众、依靠群众，遇事多和群众商量，虚心听取群众意见，接受群众监督等好作风。
    这个区的革委会在工作中取得一些成绩后，个别同志产生了骄傲自满和停顿起来不求进步的情绪。但是，在比学赶帮群众运动中，这个区没有名列前茅，个别同志又焦急不安。军队代表和革委会的领导成员发现了这个问题，就以为什么“打胜仗就骄傲，打败仗就消极”为题，开办毛泽东思想学习班，活学活用毛泽东思想。在学习班中，大家摆了“骄”字的表现，挖了“骄”字的根源，找了“骄”字的危害，认识到“骄”字是一种腐蚀剂，它影响革命事业的发展。大家加深了对“骄”字的仇恨，立即行动起来，连续五次到一个先进单位去找差距，从现象到本质，从外因到内因，一次比一次深刻，一步又一步触及灵魂，学出了水平，赶上了先进。
