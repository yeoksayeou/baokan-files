Members of Revolutionary Committees at all levels across the country are seriously studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao and maintain close ties with the masses, building the Revolutionary Committees into revolutionary battle command centers.

	New China News Agency, March 31st: Our great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "The basic experience of the Revolutionary Committees is threefold: one is the representation of revolutionary cadres, one is the representation of the military, and one is the representation of revolutionary masses, achieving the three-in-one combination of the revolution. The Revolutionary Committees should implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative structures, streamline and reduce bureaucracy, and organize a revolutionary leadership team that is connected with the masses." Revolutionary cadres, military representatives, and revolutionary mass representatives participating in Revolutionary Committees at all levels across the country have been studying Chairman Mao's brilliant latest instructions repeatedly and earnestly. They enthusiastically acclaim the three-in-one combination Revolutionary Committees! They are immensely moved, saying that Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions perfectly, scientifically, and profoundly summarize the experiences of Revolutionary Committees at all levels, pointing out the fundamental direction for the construction of Revolutionary Committees, and providing a powerful ideological weapon for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We will definitely resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions, building the Revolutionary Committees into revolutionary battle command centers that are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao and connected with the masses, making them play a tremendous revolutionary role in leading the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	To build the Revolutionary Committees into leadership teams that are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, the most fundamental thing is to actively learn and apply, study and use Mao Zedong Thought.

	"Navigating the sea relies on the helmsman, making revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." When discussing their understanding of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the editorial "Revolutionary Committees Are Good," members of Revolutionary Committees across the country emphasized that the work of the Revolutionary Committees is complex, but the most fundamental thing is to actively learn and apply, study and use Mao Zedong Thought. They firmly declared that they would take being infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line as their highest standard; and take studying, executing, propagating, and defending Chairman Mao's instructions as their most sacred duty.

	The Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee held a standing committee meeting to discuss implementing Chairman Mao's instructions and the spirit of the editorial. Committee Chairman Xue Xuegong said, Revolutionary Committees must hold power for the proletariat and use power for the proletariat. The most fundamental thing is to be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, actively learning and applying, studying and using Mao Zedong Thought, and using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything. Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee Chairman Wang Xiaoyu and First Deputy Chairman, Jinan Military District leader Yang Dezhi, said, historical experience proves: following Chairman Mao is victory! Revolutionary Committees at all levels must actively learn and apply, study and use Mao Zedong Thought, use Mao Zedong Thought to fight against class enemies, use Mao Zedong Thought to transform their worldview, use Mao Zedong Thought to closely unite with the masses, and use Mao Zedong Thought to hold and use power well. The Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee held a standing committee meeting today to continue studying earnestly. Provincial Committee Chairman Cheng Shiqing said, follow Chairman Mao above, do everything according to Mao Zedong Thought; rely on the masses below, rooting among the masses, and the Revolutionary Committees can definitely be built into leadership teams that are forever loyal to Chairman Mao, revolutionary, and closely connected with the masses. The Heilongjiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee is holding an expanded meeting of the standing committee, using Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guide for this meeting. Provincial Committee Chairman Pan Fusheng said, 65 counties in Heilongjiang Province have all established Revolutionary Committees, powerfully promoting the development of various undertakings. In the future, Revolutionary Committees must better actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, study, execute, propagate, and defend Chairman Mao's instructions, and achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Henan Provincial Revolutionary Committee Chairman Liu Jianxun presided over a committee meeting on March 30th to earnestly study Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Participants at the meeting pointed out that the Revolutionary Committees must use Mao Zedong Thought to carry out ideological and organizational revolutionization, which is the key to establishing proletarian revolutionary authority and leading the broad revolutionary masses to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They declared that they would definitely study and use Mao Zedong Thought well, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, carry out the revolutionization of the Revolutionary Committees. Revolutionary Committees in Inner Mongolia, Jilin, Jiangsu, and other provinces and autonomous regions held standing committee meetings or expanded meetings of the standing committee to continue studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

	Leaders of these provincial and autonomous region Revolutionary Committees declared that they would take the lead in studying and using Mao Zedong Thought well, take the lead in eliminating private interests and establishing public interests, transforming their worldview, and lead the broad revolutionary masses to turn their provinces and autonomous regions into red Mao Zedong Thought schools.

	Many committee members of the Wuzhong County Revolutionary Committee in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region said after studying that the Revolutionary Committees must emphasize the "loyalty" to Chairman Mao, grasp the "use" of actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and establish proletarian "public" interests. Only then can the Revolutionary Committees be built into revolutionary battle command centers that are connected with the masses. Longxing County Revolutionary Committee Chairman He Xiuhuan said, the practice of establishing the Revolutionary Committee in Longxing County for nearly half a year proves that following Chairman Mao and following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment brings wisdom, strength, methods, and victory. All members of the Taohu People's Commune Revolutionary Committee in Longfeng County, Anhui Province, immediately arranged their future work after studying and discussing, requiring each member of the Revolutionary Committee to take the lead in carrying out ideological revolutionization, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever be students of the masses, and forever be servants of the people.

	To build the Revolutionary Committees into leadership teams that are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, it is necessary to firmly hold and use power with proletarian party spirit.

	The great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "We stand on the side of the proletariat and the people. For Communist Party members, it also means standing on the side of the party, standing on the side of party spirit and party policy." Members of Revolutionary Committees across the country emphasized when studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the three-in-one combination that the Revolutionary Committees are power organs of the proletarian dictatorship. They must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, insist on proletarian party spirit, resolutely overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and resolutely fight against mountainism and sectarianism. They must hold and use power for the proletariat to ensure that our proletarian revolutionary power will never change color.

	First Deputy Chairman Liu Zichou of the Hebei Provincial Revolutionary Committee said at a rally held by the provincial and municipal Revolutionary Committees and local garrison troops today that members of the Revolutionary Committees must insist on holding power with proletarian party spirit, resolutely overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchism, and resolutely oppose mountainism and sectarianism. Inside the Revolutionary Committees, democracy must be fully carried out, the masses must be fully mobilized, and criticism and self-criticism must be carried out regularly to make the Revolutionary Committees truly represent the interests of the broadest revolutionary people and gain the support and trust of the broadest revolutionary people. Members of the Xizhimen Railway Station Revolutionary Committee of the Beijing Railway Bureau followed Chairman Mao's teachings, resolutely overcame bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism, and insisted on holding power according to proletarian party spirit. The revolutionary three-in-one combination became increasingly consolidated, and the Revolutionary Committee established proletarian authority among the masses, making revolution and production vigorous. The leader of this station's Revolutionary Committee said: whether or not we can overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and hold power according to proletarian party spirit is an important sign of whether we are loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The Revolutionary Committee is a power organ of the proletarian dictatorship, not a joint organization of several factions, and even less a liaison station for various factions. We members of the Revolutionary Committee are determined to forever be servants of the people and never representatives of factional interests. Members of the Xianfeng Electric Motor Factory Revolutionary Committee studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions, reviewed the work of the Revolutionary Committee since its establishment, and more deeply realized that the most fundamental task of the Revolutionary Committee is to hold the great power of studying, propagating, executing, and defending Mao Zedong Thought, and to hold and use power according to proletarian party spirit. They declared that they would definitely insist on acting according to proletarian party spirit, continuously consolidate the revolutionary unity of the Revolutionary Committee members, never leave the masses, and build the Revolutionary Committee into a strong battle command center that prominently displays proletarian politics and holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

	To build the Revolutionary Committees into leadership teams that are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, it is necessary to closely connect with the masses.

	The great leader Chairman Mao points out: "The most fundamental thing in the reform of state organs is to connect with the masses." Members of Revolutionary Committees across the country repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and declared that they would forever insist on the mass line and maintain close ties with the masses; implement unified leadership, streamline and reduce bureaucracy, reform the system, and reform the style, making the Revolutionary Committees deeply rooted among the masses forever.

	Revolutionary leader Wang Shaoyong, a member of the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee, said that more than a year of revolutionary practice has proven that revolutionary mass representatives participating in the Revolutionary Committees infinitely love the great commander Mao Zedong, follow Mao Zedong's great strategic deployment, and actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought. They are revolutionary warriors with practical experience. They are not only pioneers in class struggle but also models of adhering to the mass line and closely connecting with the masses. Over the past year, we have learned many precious things from them. In the future, we will definitely follow Chairman Mao's teachings, more closely rely on the masses, connect with the masses, further transform our worldview, follow the great commander Mao Zedong, and achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Tianjin Military District active learner of Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman of the Zhaozhou County Revolutionary Committee, Tian Yuhe, deeply felt that to make the Revolutionary Committees into strong battle fortresses that are infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, every member of the Revolutionary Committees must root themselves among the masses, place themselves under the supervision of the masses, respectfully regard revolutionary masses as teachers, and sincerely accept the criticism and help of revolutionary masses. Only in this way can the newly born Revolutionary Committees grow deep roots and be full of vitality. Bo Zonglian, a standing committee member of the Huailai County Revolutionary Committee in Hebei Province, excitedly said, the Revolutionary Committees implement unified leadership, changing the phenomenon of overlapping structures and idle personnel, thus avoiding bureaucratism and preventing revisionism. Although I have become a standing committee member of the Revolutionary Committee, I must always remember the four characters "connect with the masses," never forget that I am an ordinary person, and forever be a student of the masses. In both words and deeds, I will forever be a servant of the people. Members of the basic-level Revolutionary Committees of Anshan Steel Works deeply felt that to hold and use power for the proletariat, it is necessary to insist on the mass line. After studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, they unanimously declared that they would continue to carry forward the good style of closely connecting with the masses.

	Many regional and basic-level Revolutionary Committees, while studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the three-in-one combination, formulated action plans for cadres to participate in labor or streamline and reduce bureaucracy with the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," quickly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Some standing committee members of the Changsha Municipal Revolutionary Committee are currently working in the Hunan New China Printing Plant. After studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, they declared that they would continue the system of participating in labor, insist on spending one-third of their time among the masses, and live and work with the workers, forever maintaining close ties with the masses.

	To build the Revolutionary Committees into leadership teams that are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, it is necessary to firmly grasp class struggle and line struggle.

	The great teacher Chairman Mao teaches us: "Never forget class struggle." Members of Revolutionary Committees at all levels across the country, while deeply studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, linked their local and unit struggle practices, deeply feeling that the Revolutionary Committees were born in the fierce struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, and were also continuously consolidated and developed in the storm of class struggle. After the establishment of the Revolutionary Committees, it is necessary to firmly grasp class struggle and line struggle, firmly grasp the direction of struggle, and always direct the spearhead at the traitor, spy, counter-revolutionary, and a small handful of unrepentant capitalist-roaders and ghosts and snakes. Make the Revolutionary Committees into battle command centers that prominently display proletarian politics, are full of revolutionary enthusiasm, are swift and decisive, and can lead the proletariat and revolutionary masses to charge into the enemy's ranks.

	Guizhou Provincial Revolutionary Committee Chairman Li Zaichan said in a study and discussion that the establishment of the Revolutionary Committees does not mean the end of class struggle. The closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to a comprehensive victory, the more acute and complex the class struggle becomes. We must follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, heighten revolutionary vigilance, resolutely implement proletarian dictatorship over traitors, spies, counter-revolutionaries, a small handful of unrepentant capitalist-roaders, and ghosts and snakes, and fiercely strike at a small handful of class enemies who dare to counterattack Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and proletarian dictatorship. Persistently and deeply carry out revolutionary criticism and struggle, thoroughly eliminate all counter-revolutionary revisionist poison. Carry out ideological revolutionization and prevent the attack of bourgeois sugar-coated bullets. The military representative of the Beijing Second Rolling Mill Revolutionary Committee said in studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions that when the factory's Revolutionary Committee was born, some comrades thought that the power had been seized from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and could relax. However, the class enemies did not sleep, they maliciously slandered and attacked the newly born Revolutionary Committee, attempting to overthrow and sabotage the proletarian revolutionary power. We organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, unified their understanding, held Mao Zedong Thought study classes in the factory, carried out bitter-sweet activities, conducted class education, deeply carried out revolutionary criticism, and strongly opposed anarchism, greatly enhancing the class consciousness and line struggle consciousness of revolutionary workers, distinguishing between enemies and ourselves, isolating and striking at class enemies. Everyone deeply felt: after the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee, among the ten thousand things, the most important thing is to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works and firmly grasp class struggle; among the ten thousand important things, the most important thing is to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and lead the proletariat and revolutionary masses to fight against class enemies.

	Many military representatives participating in Revolutionary Committees at all levels emphasized in their study and discussion that they would definitely closely unite with revolutionary leading cadres and revolutionary mass representatives in the Revolutionary Committees, further strengthen military-civilian unity, smash the plots of class enemies to shake and overthrow the Revolutionary Committees from the right or ultra-"left" side, and strengthen and consolidate the proletarian dictatorship.

    天津市革命委员会召开了常委会议，讨论贯彻毛主席的指示和社论精神。市革委会主任解学恭同志说，革命委员会要为无产阶级掌好权，用好权，最根本的一条，就是要无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，活学活用、学好用好毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想统帅一切。山东省革命委员会主任王效禹同志和第一副主任、济南部队负责人杨得志同志说，历史经验证明：紧跟毛主席，就是胜利！各级革命委员会就是要活学活用、学好用好毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想同阶级敌人作战，用毛泽东思想改造自己的世界观，用毛泽东思想紧密团结群众，用毛泽东思想掌好权、用好权。江西省革命委员会今天召开了常委会，继续认真学习。省革委会主任程世清同志说，上跟毛主席，处处照毛泽东思想办事；下靠群众，扎根于群众之中，就一定能够把革命委员会建设成一个永远忠于毛主席的革命化的密切联系群众的领导班子。黑龙江省革命委员会正在举行常委扩大会议，他们把毛主席的最新指示作为开好这次会议的指南。省革委会主任潘复生同志说，黑龙江省六十五个县已经全部建立了革命委员会，有力地推动了各项事业的发展。今后，革命委员会要更好地活学活用毛泽东思想，学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛主席的指示，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。河南省革命委员会主任刘建勋同志在三十日主持召开委员会议，认真学习毛主席的最新指示。参加会议的同志指出，革委会用毛泽东思想搞好本身的思想革命化和组织革命化，是建立无产阶级革命权威，带领广大革命群众夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键。他们表示，一定要学好用好毛泽东思想，在毛主席最新指示的指引下，搞好革命委员会的革命化。内蒙古、吉林、江苏等省、区的革命委员会，分别召开常委会议或常委扩大会议，继续学习毛主席的最新指示。
    这些省、区的革委会负责人表示，决心带头学好用好毛泽东思想，带头破私立公，改造世界观，带领广大革命群众把本省、区办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    宁夏回族自治区吴忠县革命委员会的许多委员在学习后说，革命委员会要突出无限忠于毛主席的“忠”字，狠抓活学活用毛泽东思想的“用”字，大立无产阶级的“公”字，这样，才能把革命委员会建设成革命化的联系群众的战斗指挥部。浙江省长兴县革命委员会主任贺修贤同志说，长兴县成立革命委员会近半年的实践证明，紧跟毛主席，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，就出智慧，就有力量，就有办法，就是胜利。安徽省长丰县陶湖人民公社革委会全体成员在学习讨论后，立即布置了今后的工作，要求革委会每个成员带头搞好思想革命化，永远忠于毛主席，永远当群众的小学生，永远做人民的勤务员。
      要把革命委员会建设成为无限忠于
  毛主席的领导班子，必须坚持用无产阶级
  党性掌好权用好权
    伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“我们是站在无产阶级的和人民大众的立场。对于共产党员来说，也就是要站在党的立场，站在党性和党的政策的立场。”各地革委会的成员在学习毛主席关于革命三结合的最新指示时强调指出，革命委员会是无产阶级专政的权力机构，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持无产阶级党性原则，坚决克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，坚决同山头主义、宗派主义作斗争，为无产阶级掌好权，用好权，保证我们的无产阶级革命政权永不变色。
    河北省革命委员会第一副主任刘子厚同志在省、市革委会和当地驻军今天举行的集会上说，革命委员会的成员，都必须坚持用无产阶级党性掌权，坚决克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和无政府主义，坚决反对山头主义、宗派主义。革委会内部要充分发扬民主，放手发动群众，经常开展批评与自我批评，使革委会真正代表最广大革命人民的利益，得到最广大革命人民的拥护和支持。北京铁路局西直门火车站革委会的成员，遵循毛主席的教导，坚决克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，坚持按无产阶级党性原则掌权，革命的三结合越来越巩固，革委会在群众中建立了无产阶级权威，革命和生产搞得生气勃勃。这个车站的革委会负责人说：能不能克服资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，按无产阶级党性原则掌权，是检验我们忠不忠于毛主席，忠不忠于毛泽东思想，忠不忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的重要标志。革委会是无产阶级专政的权力机构，不是几派的联合组织，更不是各派的联络站。我们革委会的成员决心永远做人民的勤务员，决不作派别利益的代表。上海先锋电机厂革委会的成员，学习了毛主席的最新指示，检查了革委会成立以来的工作，更深刻地体会到，革委会最根本的任务，就是要掌好学习、宣传、执行、捍卫毛泽东思想的大权，就是要按无产阶级党性原则掌好权用好权。他们表示，一定坚持按无产阶级党性原则办事，不断巩固革委会成员的革命团结，一刻也不脱离群众，把革委会建设成为高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的突出无产阶级政治的坚强的战斗指挥部。
      要把革命委员会建设成为无限忠于
  毛主席的领导班子，必须密切联系群众
    伟大领袖毛主席指出：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”各地革命委员会的成员，反复学习了毛主席的最新指示，表示要永远坚持群众路线，和群众保持血肉联系；要实行一元化的领导，实行“精兵简政”，改革机构，改革作风，使革命委员会永远深深地扎根于群众之中。
    上海市革命委员会领导成员、革命领导干部王少庸同志说，一年多的革命实践证明，参加革命委员会的革命群众的代表，无限热爱伟大统帅毛主席，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，活学活用毛泽东思想，是有实践经验的革命战士。他们不但是阶级斗争的闯将，而且是坚持群众路线、密切联系群众的模范。一年多来，我们向他们学到了很多宝贵的东西。今后，我们一定要遵照毛主席的教导，更加紧密地依靠群众，联系群众，进一步改造自己的世界观，紧跟伟大统帅毛主席，在无产阶级文化大革命中立新功。沈阳部队活学活用毛泽东思想积极分子、黑龙江肇州县革命委员会主任田玉和同志深有体会地说，要使革命委员会成为无限忠于毛泽东思想的坚强战斗堡垒，革命委员会的每个成员必须把自己扎根于群众之中，置于群众的监督之下，恭恭敬敬地拜革命群众为师，虚心诚恳地接受革命群众的批评和帮助，只有这样，新生的革命委员会才能根深叶茂、富有旺盛的生命力。河北省怀来县革命委员会常委、董存瑞的父亲董全忠激动地说，革命委员会实行一元化的领导，改变了机构重叠、人浮于事的现象，这样就可以避免官僚主义，防止修正主义。我虽然当了革委会常委，但我要永远牢记“联系群众”四个大字，时刻不忘自己是个老百姓，永远当群众的小学生。不仅口头上而且在行动上永远做人民的勤务员。鞍钢各基层单位革命委员会的成员，深深体会到，要为无产阶级掌好权、用好权，必须坚持群众路线。他们学习了毛主席的最新指示后一致表示，要继续发扬密切联系群众的好作风。
    许多地区和基层单位的革命委员会，一边学习毛主席关于革命三结合的最新指示，一边以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，制定干部参加劳动或“精兵简政”的行动计划，尽快地把毛主席的最新指示落实到行动中去。长沙市革命委员会的一部分常委正在湖南新华印刷厂参加劳动，他们学习了毛主席的最新指示以后，表示要把参加劳动的制度坚持下去，坚持用三分之一的时间深入群众，和职工实行“四同”，永远保持同群众的密切联系。
      要把革命委员会建设成为无限忠于
  毛主席的领导班子，必须狠抓阶级斗争和
  路线斗争
    伟大导师毛主席教导我们：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”。各地各级革命委员会的成员在深入学习毛主席的最新指示时，联系本地区、本单位的斗争实践，深有体会地说：革命委员会是在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争中诞生的，也是在阶级斗争的风浪中不断巩固、发展起来的。革命委员会成立后，必须狠抓阶级斗争和路线斗争，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，始终把矛头指向中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派及其代理人。使革命委员会成为突出无产阶级政治，充满革命干劲，雷厉风行，能带领无产阶级和革命群众向着阶级敌人冲锋陷阵的精悍有力的战斗指挥部。
    贵州省革命委员会主任李再含同志在学习讨论时说，革命委员会的成立，并不意味着阶级斗争的结束。无产阶级文化大革命越接近全面胜利，阶级斗争就越尖锐、复杂。我们要遵照毛主席的伟大教导，提高革命警惕性，坚决对叛徒、特务、反革命分子、一小撮死不悔改的走资派和牛鬼蛇神实行无产阶级专政，狠狠地打击一小撮敢于向毛主席的革命路线和无产阶级专政进行反扑的阶级敌人。要持久地、深入地开展革命的大批判，彻底肃清一切反革命修正主义流毒。要搞好思想革命化，严防资产阶级糖衣炮弹的袭击。北京第二轧钢厂革命委员会的解放军代表在学习毛主席的最新指示时说，厂的革委会胜利诞生时，有的同志认为向党内一小撮走资派夺权胜利了，可以松口气了。但是，阶级敌人并没有睡觉，他们恶毒地诬蔑和攻击新生的革命委员会，妄图颠覆和破坏无产阶级革命政权。我们组织大家学习了毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导，统一了认识，在厂里大办毛泽东思想学习班，开展忆苦思甜活动，进行阶级教育，深入开展革命大批判，大反无政府主义，大大提高了革命职工的阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟，分清了敌我，孤立和打击了阶级敌人。大家深深体会到：革命委员会成立后，千件事，万件事，活学活用毛主席著作，狠抓阶级斗争是头件事；千重要，万重要，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，领导无产阶级和革命群众向阶级敌人进行斗争最重要。
    许多参加各级革命委员会的部队代表，在学习、讨论中强调说，我们一定坚决同革命委员会中的革命领导干部和革命群众代表紧紧团结在一起，进一步加强军民团结，粉碎阶级敌人从右的或极“左”的方面来动摇、颠覆革命委员会的阴谋，加强和巩固无产阶级专政。
