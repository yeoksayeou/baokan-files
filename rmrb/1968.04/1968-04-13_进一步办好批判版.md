Edition: 3

The "Seven Hundred Million People All Become Critics" column is our workers, peasants, and soldiers' battlefront. Some articles are concise and to the point, explaining principles vividly; reading them is enlightening. Some articles feature real people and events, recalling bitterness and sweetness, making them excellent materials for class education. We enjoy reading these articles. These articles are very helpful for us in criticizing China's Khrushchev, providing us with many insights.

To further improve this criticism column and thoroughly criticize and expose China's Khrushchev, we suggest:

1. Articles in the criticism column should closely align with the current class struggle situation and central tasks, reflecting the masses' active thoughts and new problems in the movement;

2. We hope that criticism articles can use specific and vivid examples to reflect the revolutionary masses' personal experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works;

3. We hope to see more articles by old workers and poor and lower-middle peasants that include content about recalling bitterness and sweetness, making class education a regular practice;

4. Widely publish criticism pieces from workers, peasants, and soldiers from various regions, fronts, and positions. When publishing, various forms can be adopted to enrich and expand the content of the column. We suggest using satirical articles for criticism;

5. Currently, there are many special pages. We hope to see more letters or excerpts from workers and peasants from various places in the future.

    进一步办好批判版
    《七亿人民都来做批判家》这个版，是我们工农兵的战斗阵地。有些文章，短小精悍，道理谈得活，读了得到启发；有些文章，活人活事，忆苦思甜，是阶级教育的好材料。我们很喜欢读这些文章。这些文章对于我们批判中国赫鲁晓夫有很大帮助，使我们从中得到很多启示。
    为了进一步办好这个批判版，彻底批倒批臭中国赫鲁晓夫，我们建议：
      一、批判版的文章，要密切结合当前的阶级斗争形势和中心工作，要反映群众的活思想和运动中的新问题；
    二、希望批判文章能用具体生动的事例，反映革命群众活学活用毛主席著作的切身感受；
    三、希望不断刊登老工人、老贫下中农带有忆苦思甜内容的批判文章，使阶级教育经常化；
    四、广泛刊登各地区、各条战线、各个岗位的工农兵革命群众的批判稿件；在刊用时，可采取多样形式，丰富和扩大版面内容。建议选用杂文形式的批判文章；
    五、目前专页比较多，希望以后多发些各地工农兵的来稿或来稿摘编。
