Awakened American blacks, fearing no brutality, are bravely fighting back. The flames of resistance have quickly spread to 125 cities. The American ruling class is simultaneously conducting bloody suppression and playing deceitful tricks in an attempt to extinguish the flames of black resistance.

	New York, April 11 (Xinhua) — Washington: Despite the frenzied suppression by tens of thousands of fascist police and military, the struggle of American black masses against racial oppression and for equal rights continues to develop rapidly. In recent days, more cities have seen black armed resistance of varying scales. Preliminary statistics show that in just one week up to the 10th, the surging black struggle has affected 125 large and small American cities. This situation has caused the American ruling class to panic, and while intensifying suppression, they are also playing deceitful tricks, using both soft and hard tactics, in an attempt to extinguish the flames of black resistance.

	In Kansas City, Missouri, after black masses fought bravely for 20 hours on the 9th, they took to the streets again on the evening of the 10th, engaging in fierce battles with the 3,000 "National Guard" troops and armed police who were ordered to enter the city to strengthen suppression.

	Black masses set nearly a hundred fires in the city, destroying many white exploiters' shops. Black snipers fired from rooftops, windows, and cars at fascist police and military. The police "command center" set up in the black neighborhood was frequently under sniper fire, and the police academy was burned down by black masses. Military police patrol cars driving through the city were constantly attacked by a barrage of stones and glass bottles thrown by black masses. This situation made the reactionary authorities tremble with fear. The police chief repeatedly exclaimed that the situation was "very, very serious." Mayor Davis declared a state of emergency for the entire city that evening.

	In Youngstown, Ohio, the steel center, despite the reactionary authorities sending in hundreds more "National Guard" troops and even deploying tanks to strengthen suppression, black masses still bravely resisted on the 10th for the second consecutive night. Black snipers attacked fascist police and military from all directions, making them retreat in disarray.

	In addition, in Trenton and Newark, New Jersey, New Haven, Connecticut, Grand Rapids and Niles, Michigan, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and other cities, black armed resistance also broke out.

	The American ruling class has always used violence and political deception to maintain its reactionary rule. Facing such a large-scale black struggle, they have used unprecedented large-scale armed suppression. By the 10th, the number of troops involved in suppression had increased to over 60,000. More than 30 black masses were killed by reactionary police and military, about 2,000 were injured, and nearly 19,000 were arrested.

	While conducting large-scale armed suppression against black masses, the American imperialist Johnson and others hypocritically expressed condolences to the family of Martin Luther King Jr., who was killed by white racists, even going to church to pay silent tribute to this pastor, engaging in shameless deception.

	At Johnson's behest, the U.S. Congress hastily passed a so-called "civil rights" bill to "eliminate racial discrimination in housing" on the 10th. To support this deception, Johnson personally appeared at a press conference to advocate for "rule of law," claiming that "through legal procedures, one can forever break the unjust shackles of the past (placed on blacks)" and demanding that black masses "obey the law" in the face of the bloody suppression by a large number of fully armed police and military. However, everyone knows that the American ruling class has been manufacturing "civil rights" bills year after year, and the broad black masses are still suffering deeply, struggling on the brink of hunger and death. They can't even eat, let alone afford to rent or buy houses in white areas. This bill, like some of the American ruling class's past "civil rights" bills, is merely an attempt to deceive black masses and dull their fighting spirit.

	For seven days, the broad black masses have seen their brothers and sisters killed by reactionary police and military rifles and bayonets every day. Johnson's sweet talk cannot deceive them. As a responsible person from an influential black progressive organization said, when blacks are constantly being killed, black masses do not care about any "laws."

    觉醒了的美国黑人不畏强暴英勇斗争
    抗暴烈火迅速燃遍一百二十五个城市
    美国统治集团一面进行血腥镇压一面玩弄欺骗花招妄图扑灭黑人斗争烈火
    新华社十一日讯　华盛顿消息：不顾数万名法西斯军警的疯狂镇压，美国黑人群众反对种族压迫、争取平等权利的斗争继续迅猛发展。连日来又有更多的城市爆发了规模不等的黑人武力抗暴斗争。据初步统计，到十日为止的短短一周中，汹涌澎湃的黑人斗争已经波及一百二十五个美国大小城市。这种形势使美国统治集团恐慌万状，在加紧进行镇压的同时，又在大耍欺骗的花招，软硬兼施，妄图把黑人斗争的怒火扑灭下去。
    在密苏里州的堪萨斯城，黑人群众在九日进行了持续二十小时的英勇斗争之后，十日晚上又涌上街头，同奉命开进市内加强镇压的三千名“国民警卫队”和武装警察顽强搏斗。
    黑人群众在市内点燃了近百起大火，捣毁了许多白人剥削者的商店。黑人狙击手从屋顶、从窗口、从汽车上开枪射击法西斯军警。设在黑人区的警察“指挥所”经常受到黑人狙击手的射击，警官学校也被黑人群众放火烧毁。在市内横冲直闯的军警巡逻车，不断遭到黑人群众投来的雨点般的石块和玻璃瓶的袭击。这种情况使得反动当局胆战心惊。警察头子连连惊呼，局势“非常、非常严重”。市长戴维斯当晚悍然宣布全城处于“紧急状态”。
    在俄亥俄州的钢铁中心扬斯敦，尽管反动当局又增调了数百名“国民警卫队”进入市内，甚至出动坦克加强镇压，但是黑人群众在十日仍然连续第二夜展开英勇的抗暴斗争。黑人狙击手四出袭击法西斯军警，打得他们狼狈不堪。
    另外，在新泽西州的首府特伦顿和纽瓦克、康涅狄格州的纽黑文、密执安州的格兰德拉皮兹和奈尔斯、路易斯安那州的巴吞鲁日等城市也都分别爆发了黑人武力抗暴斗争。
    美国统治集团一向使用暴力镇压和政治欺骗的反革命两手来维持其反动统治。面临这样一场空前规模的黑人斗争，他们使用了空前大规模的武装镇压。到十日为止，投入镇压行动的军队人数已经增加到六万多。黑人群众三十多人被反动军警打死，大约两千人受伤，将近一万九千人被捕。
    在对黑人群众进行大规模武装镇压的同时，美帝头子约翰逊等又假惺惺地向被白人种族主义者谋害的马丁·路德·金牧师的家属表示吊唁，甚至到教堂为这个牧师表示默哀，进行招摇撞骗。
    在约翰逊的授意下，美国国会在十日赶紧通过了一项所谓“消除在住房方面的种族歧视”的“民权”法案。配合这一骗局，约翰逊还亲自出马，在记者招待会上鼓吹“法治”，说什么“通过法律程序，可以一劳永逸地打碎过去（加在黑人身上的）不公正的枷锁”，并且要求黑人群众在大批全副武装的军警的血腥镇压面前“律己守法”。但是，大家都知道，美国统治集团年年炮制什么“民权”法案，广大的黑人群众依然苦难深重，挣扎在饥饿死亡线上。他们连饭都吃不饱，哪里有钱到白人区去租房、买房呢？这个法案，象美国统治集团过去的一些“民权”法案一样，只不过是妄想用来欺骗黑人群众、麻痹他们的斗志的一种骗局。
    七天来，广大的黑人群众每天都看到他们的弟兄姐妹死于反动军警的步枪和刺刀之下。约翰逊的甜言蜜语决骗不了他们。正如一个有影响的黑人进步组织的负责人所说，当黑人在不断遭到杀害的时候，黑人群众是不管什么“法律”的。
