Friends from five continents in Beijing warmly hail Chairman Mao's statement providing a powerful ideological weapon for world revolutionary people

It is necessary to use revolutionary violence to oppose counter-revolutionary violence

	The General Secretary of the Afro-Asian Journalists Association, Mr. Chahoda, made a statement, calling on Afro-Asian revolutionary journalists to enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's call, take action, and strongly support the struggle of American blacks against violence.

	New China News Agency, April 18th: Friends from various countries on five continents in Beijing spoke to our reporter, warmly hailing Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence. They said that this statement is the greatest support and encouragement for American blacks and revolutionary people around the world, and it is extremely important guidance. It is a heavy blow to American imperialism and its accomplices.

	Friends from various countries pointed out that Chairman Mao's statement once again points the way for American blacks and oppressed people and nations around the world to struggle for liberation. They expressed their determination to unite and take action, to support the just struggle of American blacks, and to launch a sustained and fierce attack on the evil American imperialism and its accomplices.

	Japanese friend Yoshida Koichi said in his statement: Chairman Mao's statement is a guiding document for the struggle of the Japanese people and people around the world. Chairman Mao's statement tells us that we must not harbor any illusions about American imperialism; we must use revolutionary violence to oppose counter-revolutionary violence. Only in this way can we achieve victory in our struggle. Chairman Mao issued a call to arms in his statement. The Japanese people and people around the world should turn Chairman Mao's statement into material force and fight, defeating our most vicious common enemy, American imperialism.

	Indonesian friend Modiro said: Chairman Mao is the leader of the people of the world. We study Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence and must remember the truth that revolutionary violence must be used to oppose counter-revolutionary violence. Now, Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people in Indonesia are learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought, taking to the path of armed struggle. The flames of armed struggle have already been ignited on the main islands of Indonesia. As long as we are loyal to Mao Zedong Thought and follow the path of people's war, the Indonesian people will one day overthrow the reactionary rule of Suharto-Nasution and achieve revolutionary victory.

	Tanzanian friend Abed said: Chairman Mao is the great leader of the Chinese people and also the great leader of the people of the world. Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence will accelerate the further awakening of American blacks, promote the rapid development of their struggle, and inspire the liberation struggle of the African people and oppressed people around the world.

	Sudanese friends Ali Sadig and Said Naim said: Chairman Mao's statement has given the oppressed people and nations of the world a powerful weapon. Every word of Chairman Mao is the truth of the oppressed people seeking liberation. The struggle of American blacks further proves Chairman Mao's wise judgment: "All reactionaries are paper tigers." The people of the world, guided by Mao Zedong Thought, will be able to free themselves from the slavery of imperialism and colonialism and ultimately bury them.

	Sudanese friends said: Chairman Mao said in his statement: "It can be said with certainty that the thorough collapse of colonialism, imperialism, and all systems of exploitation, and the thorough liberation of all oppressed peoples and nations in the world, are not far off." We firmly believe that under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, a new world without imperialism, capitalism, and systems of exploitation will surely be realized.

	A friend from the Somali coast, Fahad, said: The red sun in the hearts of the people of the world, the great leader Chairman Mao's statement, like a lighthouse, illuminates the path of struggle for the people of the world. Chairman Mao stands with the oppressed people and nations. At every critical moment, Chairman Mao points out the path of struggle and the hope of victory for the people of the world. Chairman Mao said: "The lifespan of the imperialists will not be long." The people of the world should, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, unite and strive for the final victory.

	A friend from Azania, Mokoni, said: Chairman Mao's statement is the call to march for the oppressed people and nations, and it will guide the oppressed people and nations to be reborn.

	Mokoni said: Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the history of mankind, any reactionary force that is about to perish will always make a final struggle against the revolutionary force." The nature of American imperialism will not change. The people of all countries should, with the spirit of moving mountains taught by Chairman Mao, remove the imperialist and colonialist mountains from their heads. We are convinced that American imperialism will surely be buried by the people.

	Friends from Mali, Dumbaya Segu and Dafi Adama, said in their written statement: Chairman Mao's statement expresses the wishes of all black people in Africa. Every time Chairman Mao makes a statement, he always supports the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world. We will follow Chairman Mao in supporting the revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries.

	Chilean friend Margarita Saldívar said in her statement: Chairman Mao calls on the people of all countries to take action and support the struggle of American blacks. The greatest support we Latin American people can give to American blacks is to carry out a revolution in their own country and apply Mao Zedong Thought to the practical struggle in their own country.

	A friend from New Zealand said: Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught us, "Revolution is an uprising," "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." The struggle of American blacks makes more people further understand Chairman Mao's teachings, and more and more people decide to stand on the side of the progressive forces.

	German friend Nibank said in her statement: She introduced the current situation of the struggle against fascist tyranny by the German people. She said: Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence supports the struggle of American blacks and at the same time supports our struggle in West Germany. The analysis made by Chairman Mao in his statement makes us further realize that the struggle of the German people is an integral part of the overall struggle of the people of the world against American imperialism. Chairman Mao's teachings will make the German people more aware and unite with the people of the world, support each other, and launch an attack on American imperialism.

	New China News Agency, April 18th: The General Secretary of the Afro-Asian Journalists Association, Mr. Chahoda, today made a statement to the reporter of the New China News Agency regarding the great leader Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence. He called on Afro-Asian revolutionary journalists to enthusiastically respond to Chairman Mao's call, take action, and strongly support the struggle of American blacks against violence.

	Chahoda said: Chairman Mao's great statement "has great and far-reaching significance for the further development of the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world, both in theory and practice. Chairman Mao has given the most correct and comprehensive answer to the urgent questions facing American blacks and revolutionary people around the world: that is, the struggle against the imperialist system based on plunderous monopolies and the struggle against the rule of the monopolistic bourgeoisie. Chairman Mao's statement makes us see more clearly that the current development of the situation in the United States is the embodiment and inevitable result of the evil policies of monopolistic capitalism and imperialism. The struggle of American blacks is an integral part of the struggle of the people of the world against the system of exploitation."

	Chahoda said, "From the fact that Martin Luther King, a non-violent advocate, was suddenly assassinated by American imperialists, as pointed out by Chairman Mao, I am more convinced than ever of the truth that revolutionary violence must be used to oppose counter-revolutionary violence."

	Chahoda emphasized: I believe that the ultimate goal of the struggle of American blacks and white proletarians is complete liberation, and it is also the ultimate goal of the struggle of the oppressed people of the world. As Chairman Mao said: "The struggle of American blacks will inevitably combine with the labor movement in the United States, ultimately ending the evil rule of the American monopolistic bourgeoisie." This clearly points out to American blacks and the people the only correct path to the final victory of their revolutionary struggle.

    亚非记协总书记查禾多发表谈话，号召亚非革命新闻工作者热烈响应毛主席的呼吁，行动起来，给予美国黑人的抗暴斗争以强大的声援
    新华社十八日讯　在北京的五大洲的各国朋友，向本社记者发表谈话，热烈欢呼毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明，对于美国黑人和世界各国革命人民是最大的支持和鼓舞，是极其重要的指导，对美帝国主义及其帮凶们是个沉重的打击。
    各国朋友指出，毛主席的声明，再一次为美国黑人和全世界被压迫人民、被压迫民族指明了争取解放的道路。他们表示要团结起来，行动起来，声援美国黑人的正义斗争，向万恶的美帝国主义及其帮凶们展开持久的猛烈的进攻。
    日本朋友吉田浩一在谈话中说，毛主席的声明是指引日本人民和世界人民斗争的纲领性文件。毛主席的声明告诉我们，对于美帝国主义，不能抱有任何幻想，必须用革命的暴力反对反革命的暴力，只有这样才能取得斗争的胜利。毛主席在声明中向我们发出了战斗的号召。日本人民和全世界人民，都应把毛主席的声明化为物质力量，进行斗争，打败我们最凶恶的共同敌人美帝国主义。
    印度尼西亚朋友莫迪罗说，毛主席是世界人民的领袖，我们学习毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明，要牢记用革命暴力反对反革命暴力这一真理。现在，印度尼西亚的马克思列宁主义者和革命人民，正在学习和运用毛泽东思想，走上武装斗争的道路。武装斗争的烈火已经在印度尼西亚的主要岛屿上燃烧起来。只要我们忠于毛泽东思想，走人民战争的道路，印尼人民总有一天会推翻苏哈托—纳苏蒂安的反动统治，取得革命的胜利。
    坦桑尼亚朋友阿贝德说，毛主席是中国人民的伟大领袖，也是全世界人民的伟大领袖。毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明，必将加速美国黑人的进一步觉醒，促进他们斗争的迅速发展，并将鼓舞非洲人民和全世界被压迫人民的解放斗争。
    苏丹朋友阿里·萨迪格和赛义德·纳伊姆说，毛主席的声明给了世界被压迫人民、被压迫民族强大的武器。毛主席的每一句话都是被压迫人民求解放的真理。美国黑人的斗争，进一步证明了毛主席的英明论断：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。”全世界人民以毛泽东思想为指导，进行武装斗争，就能够摆脱帝国主义、殖民主义的奴役，最终埋葬它们。
    苏丹朋友说，毛主席在声明中说：“可以肯定，殖民主义、帝国主义和一切剥削制度的彻底崩溃，世界上一切被压迫人民、被压迫民族的彻底翻身，已经为期不远了。”我们深信，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的新世界，定将实现。
    来自索马里海岸的朋友发哈说，世界人民心中的红太阳、伟大的领袖毛主席的声明，象灯塔一样照亮了全世界人民斗争的道路。毛主席和被压迫人民、被压迫民族站在一起，在每个关键时刻，毛主席都向世界人民指出斗争的道路和胜利的希望。毛主席说：“帝国主义者的寿命不会很长了”。全世界人民要按照毛主席的教导，团结起来，争取最后胜利的到来。
    阿扎尼亚朋友莫柯尼说，毛主席的声明是被压迫人民、被压迫民族进军的号角，它将指导被压迫人民、被压迫民族获得新生。
    莫柯尼说，毛主席教导我们：“在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。美帝国主义的本性是不会改变的。世界各国人民要以毛主席教导的愚公移山的精神，除掉压在头上的帝国主义、殖民主义的大山。我们确信，美帝国主义必定会被人民所埋葬。
    马里朋友杜姆比亚·塞古和达菲·阿达马在他们的书面谈话中说，毛主席的声明说出了全非洲黑人的愿望。毛主席每次发表声明，总是支持世界人民的革命斗争。我们要跟着毛主席支持各国人民的革命斗争。
    智利朋友玛格丽塔·萨尔迪瓦尔在谈话中说，毛主席号召世界各国人民行动起来，声援美国黑人的斗争。我们拉丁美洲人民对美国黑人最大的支持，就是要在他们本国进行革命，把毛泽东思想应用于本国的斗争实际。
    新西兰的一位朋友说，毛主席一再教导我们，“革命是暴动”，“枪杆子里面出政权”，美国黑人的斗争使更多的人进一步理解了毛主席的教导，越来越多的人决定站到进步力量方面来。
    西德朋友尼班克在谈话中介绍了西德人民目前进行的反法西斯暴政的斗争情况。她说，毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明，支持了美国黑人的斗争，同时也是支持了我们西德人民的斗争。毛主席在声明中所作的分析，使我们进一步认识到，西德人民的斗争就是全世界人民反对美帝国主义的总斗争的一个组成部分。毛主席的教导，将使西德人民更加觉悟起来，同全世界人民团结在一起，互相支持，向美帝国主义发动进攻。
    新华社十八日讯　亚非新闻工作者协会总书记查禾多，今天就伟大领袖毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明，向新华社记者发表谈话，他号召亚非革命新闻工作者热烈响应毛主席的呼吁，行动起来，给予美国黑人的抗暴斗争以强大的声援。
    查禾多说，毛主席的伟大声明“对全世界人民革命斗争的进一步发展，无论在理论上和实践中，都具有伟大而深远的意义。毛主席最正确、最全面地回答了美国黑人和全世界革命人民所面临的迫切问题：即反对以掠夺性的垄断制度为基础的帝国主义制度和反对垄断资产阶级统治的斗争。毛主席的声明使我们更清楚地看到，美国当前形势的发展是垄断资本主义和帝国主义罪恶政策的体现及其必然结果。美国黑人的斗争是全世界人民反对剥削制度的斗争的一个组成部分。”
    查禾多说，“从毛主席所指出的，非暴力主义者马丁·路德·金突然被美帝国主义者所暗杀的事实，使我更加相信必须以革命的暴力反对反革命的暴力这一真理。”
    查禾多强调说，我认为，彻底解放是美国黑人、白人无产阶级斗争的最终目标，也是全世界被剥削人民斗争的最终目标。正如毛主席所说：“美国黑人斗争必将同美国工人运动相结合，最终结束美国垄断资产阶级的罪恶统治。”这就清楚地向美国黑人和人民指明了他们革命斗争取得最后胜利的唯一正确道路。
