    In the northern regions of our country, there has been little rain and snow since last winter, and some areas in the south have also experienced drought due to insufficient rainfall, resulting in limited water storage. We must remain vigilant and not be complacent about this situation.

    Chairman Mao teaches us: "Do not engage in battles without preparation, do not engage in battles without certainty." In our struggle against nature, we must also be fully prepared and prevent problems before they arise. We must not passively wait and be careless, lest we be caught off guard.

    Currently, spring plowing has begun, and spring fields need timely management. Spring agricultural irrigation is urgent. We hope that all relevant departments will raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, emphasize proletarian politics, overcome the mentality of taking chances, and seriously inspect the condition of water conservancy projects. For those communes and production brigades where water conservancy facilities are not yet complete and irrigation and drainage machinery has not been repaired, efforts should be concentrated to quickly address these issues. In areas that have had little rain since last winter, mobilize the masses to actively carry out drought prevention and resistance, and strive for a bumper harvest in agricultural production this year.—Editor

    Prepare for Everything to Prevent Spring Drought

    Recently, we have surveyed the situation of spring water conservancy and spring irrigation in some regions and found that some places do not pay enough attention to this work, and there is a certain degree of complacency among the cadres. For example, some say: Although there was little rain and snow last winter, the soil moisture was sufficient when sowing wheat, so there is no need to worry about drought in the spring. Others say: Although the reservoirs and ponds have little water now, a couple of spring rains will be enough for spring plowing. Still, others say: There is still time for spring irrigation, and it can be done later. These thoughts greatly hinder the timely spring water conservancy and spring irrigation work.

    From what we have seen in some regions, due to the little rain and snow last winter, the soil moisture content has decreased, and signs of drought have begun to appear. Based on observations over many years, not only does the north often experience spring drought, but even in the south, there are many places that experience intermittent drought. If these situations are not taken seriously, it may cause losses to agricultural production this year. Therefore, we suggest that local leading departments strengthen their leadership over spring agricultural production, start early to make preparations for drought prevention and resistance, and avoid being caught off guard. In areas where there has been little rain and snow since last winter and drought symptoms have already appeared, spring irrigation should be carried out as soon as possible to eliminate the spring drought in its early stages and achieve an even greater harvest this year.

    我国北方地区，去冬以来雨雪较少，南方部分地区也因少雨，蓄水不多。对于这种情况，必须提高警惕，不能麻痹大意。
    毛主席教导我们：“不打无准备之仗，不打无把握之仗”。我们在同大自然作斗争中，也要作好一切准备，要防患于未然。决不能消极等待、满不在乎，以免措手不及。
    目前春耕已经开始，春田也要及时管理，春季农田用水迫在眉睫。希望各有关部门，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，克服侥幸心理，认真检查水利工程情况。个别社队水利还未配套、排灌机械还未进行维修的，要集中力量抓紧抓好。去冬以来少雨的地区，要充分发动群众积极开展防旱抗旱，为夺取今年农业生产的大丰收而斗争。——编者
    作好一切准备预防春旱
    最近我们在一些地区了解春修水利和春灌工作情况，发现有的地方对这项工作还不够重视，在干部思想上存在着不同程度的麻痹大意情绪。如有的人说：去年冬天虽然雨雪少，但种麦时底墒还足，春天旱一点也不怕。也有人说：现在库塘里虽然水少，只要有一两场春雨就够春耕用了。还有人说：春灌还有一段时间，到时候再说也不迟。这些思想对于及时春修水利和春灌工作有极大的妨碍。
    从我们所到的一些地区看，有的地方由于去冬雨雪较少，现在土壤中含水量下降，旱象已开始露头。根据过去多年的观察，不仅北方地区经常会出现春旱，即使在南方，也有不少地方会出现插花旱。对这些情况如果再不引起重视，就可能使今年的农业生产遭受损失。因此，我们建议各地领导部门，切实加强对春季农业生产的领导，及早动手做好防旱抗旱的准备工作，以免措手不及。去冬雨雪较少、旱象已经露头的地区，更要及早进行春灌，把春旱消灭在刚露头的时候，夺取今年的更大丰收。
