Kaysone Phomvihane's wife held a memorial meeting in Beijing today to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the martyrdom of Kaysone Phomvihane, a prominent political figure in Laos.

Kaysone Phomvihane's wife spoke at the memorial meeting.

She said that in the five years since Kaysone Phomvihane's martyrdom, the people of Laos, under the leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front led by Souphanouvong, have waged a people's war for national liberation, which has developed even further. We must inherit the unfinished cause of the patriotic martyrs and continue the struggle to drive the common enemy of the world's people, American imperialism, out of Laos.

Kaysone Phomvihane's wife spoke about the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, saying that this great victory of the revolution provides experience for the struggle of all oppressed peoples in the world, and this victory is also a victory for the people of Laos.

Ding Xilin, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, attended the memorial meeting at the invitation and delivered a speech. Ding Xilin expressed in his speech that the Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, firmly support the anti-American patriotic struggle of the Lao people.

Friends from Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaya who are in Beijing were also invited to attend the memorial meeting.
