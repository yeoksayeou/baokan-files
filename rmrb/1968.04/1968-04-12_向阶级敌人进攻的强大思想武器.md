In the midst of the triumphant songs of the ever-improving national situation, our great leader Chairman Mao has recently issued a new directive: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a political revolution under the conditions of socialism, where the proletariat opposes the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the reactionary Kuomintang, led by the broad revolutionary masses, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie."

Chairman Mao's latest directive profoundly elucidates the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, penetratingly reveals its class content, and once again provides us with the most powerful ideological weapon for attacking class enemies.

The practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution fully proves that Chairman Mao's latest directive is an unbreakable great truth. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a political revolution. The handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, led by China's Khrushchev, and their agents in various regions, are a bunch of conspirators and power-seekers. They represent the interests of the Kuomintang reactionaries, that is, the bourgeoisie, traitors, spies, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. Our struggle against them is the continuation of our long-term struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries and the continuation of the class struggle against the bourgeoisie. If we do not overthrow them, the power will change hands, the country will change color, and history will regress. Therefore, this political revolution is a matter of paramount importance to the fate and future of our Party and our country, and it is also a matter of paramount importance to the world revolution.

Jiangsu Province has long been a stronghold of the Kuomintang reactionaries' bloody rule over the Chinese people and has always been a focal point of the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution. For a long time, China's Khrushchev's agents in Jiangsu have been colluding with traitors, forming cliques, and vigorously promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, madly engaging in evil activities to restore capitalism. After liberation, our struggle against the class enemy is the continuation of our long-term struggle against the Kuomintang and the continuation of the class struggle against the bourgeoisie. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, a handful of capitalist roaders within the Jiangsu Party, such as Jiang Weiqing and Chen Guang, acting on the instructions of China's Khrushchev, formed a counter-revolutionary alliance with traitors, spies, ghosts and monsters in society, and remnants of the Kuomintang. They split the proletarian revolutionary ranks and madly sabotaged the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, attempting to save their doomed fate. The 47 million military and civilian people of Jiangsu Province, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, closely followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and, under the guidance of his series of latest directives, fought bravely, engaged in repeated struggles, and defeated them thoroughly, achieving decisive victory in this political revolution.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Even many years after the complete annihilation of all exploiting classes on Earth, it is very possible that representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek regime will still be active in various places. The most die-hard among these people will never admit their defeat." The closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution gets to complete victory, the more fiercely the class enemies will struggle. Currently, they are still attempting to deny the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, attempting to deny the revolutionary mass movement, and directing their attacks at the proletarian headquarters, the People's Liberation Army, and the new revolutionary committees.

We must adhere to Chairman Mao's great teaching of "It is better to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining strength" and firmly grasp the initiative in class struggle, launching continuous and relentless attacks on the class enemies. To take the initiative, we must be highly vigilant and closely monitor the enemy's movements; to take the initiative, we must be strategic and decisive, striking accurately, fiercely, and steadily; to take the initiative, we must exhibit the revolutionary spirit of fearlessness and continuous combat, making the enemy breathless and unable to change their counter-revolutionary strategies, leading to their utter defeat; to take the initiative, we must fight annihilation battles. We will not be lenient or indulgent towards the enemy; if we fight, we will definitely win.

Vice Chairman Lin points out: "The people's revolution under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought is the locomotive of historical progress." The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful ideological weapon for defeating class enemies. Chairman Mao highly respects the pioneering spirit of the masses, timely summarizes the revolutionary experiences of hundreds of millions of people, deeply reveals the laws of class struggle, and continuously issues battle calls and takes wise measures, guiding us to charge into the enemy's ranks. At this critical moment of achieving complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao has issued another wise directive, making our struggle targets clearer and our direction more definite. Once Chairman Mao's latest directive is grasped by hundreds of millions of people, it will become a tremendous material force, invincible and unstoppable in the initiative to attack class enemies.

"Navigating the vast sea relies on the helmsman, and making a revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought." For Chairman Mao's latest directive, we must, with the greatest determination, the highest enthusiasm, and the fastest speed, study, propagate, and implement it. We must further raise our awareness of class struggle and line struggle, overthrow factionalism, sectarianism, rightist splitism, oppose two-faced people, resolutely strike down the rightist reversal of verdicts, and deeply and persistently carry out the revolutionary criticism and denunciation. We must thoroughly smash all the evil plots of the class enemies to shake and split the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. We must closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and seize complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization.

    向阶级敌人进攻的强大思想武器
    江苏省革命委员会主任　许世友
      在全国形势越来越好的凯歌声中，我们的伟大领袖毛主席最近又发出了最新指示：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”
    毛主席这一最新指示，最深刻地阐明了无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义，最精辟地揭示了无产阶级文化大革命的阶级内容，又一次给了我们向阶级敌人进攻的最强大的思想武器。
    无产阶级文化大革命的实践，充分证明了毛主席这一最新指示是颠扑不破的伟大真理。无产阶级文化大革命就是政治大革命。中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在各地区的代理人，是一伙阴谋家、野心家，他们代表了国民党反动派即资产阶级、叛徒、特务、地、富、反、坏、右的利益。我们和他们的斗争，就是同国民党反动派的斗争，就是同资产阶级的斗争。我们不把他们打倒，政权就要变质，国家就要变色，历史就要倒退。因此，这一场政治大革命，是关系到我们党，我们国家的命运和前途的头等大事，也是关系到世界革命的头等大事。
    江苏省曾经是国民党反动派对中国人民进行血腥统治的巢穴，历来就是革命和反革命进行搏斗的焦点。长期以来，中国赫鲁晓夫在江苏的代理人招降纳叛，结党营私，大力推行反革命修正主义路线，疯狂进行复辟资本主义的罪恶活动。解放后，我们同阶级敌人的斗争，就是和国民党长期斗争的继续，就是和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。在毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命中，江苏省党内一小撮走资派江渭清、陈光之流，秉承中国赫鲁晓夫的意旨，同叛徒、特务、社会上的牛鬼蛇神、国民党的残渣余孽等，结成反革命的同盟，分裂无产阶级革命队伍，疯狂破坏无产阶级文化大革命，妄图挽救他们覆灭的命运。用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的江苏省四千七百万军民，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在毛主席一系列最新指示的指引下，英勇战斗，反复较量，杀得他们落花流水，夺得这场政治大革命的决定性胜利。
    毛主席教导我们：“在地球上全部剥削阶级彻底灭亡之后多少年内，很可能还会有蒋介石王朝的代表人物在各地活动着。这些人中的最死硬分子是永远不会承认他们的失败的。”无产阶级文化大革命越接近全面胜利，阶级敌人越要进行垂死挣扎。当前，他们还在妄图否定无产阶级文化大革命，妄图否定革命的群众运动，把矛头指向无产阶级司令部，指向人民解放军，指向新生的革命委员会。
    我们一定要遵循毛主席“宜将剩勇追穷寇”的伟大教导，牢牢掌握阶级斗争的主动权，向阶级敌人发起主动的、持续不断的进攻。主动进攻，就要百倍提高警惕，密切注视敌人的动向；主动进攻，就要高屋建瓴，势如破竹，打得准，打得狠，打得稳；主动进攻，就要发扬不怕疲劳，连续作战的革命精神，使得敌人喘不过气来，使得敌人来不及变换反革命策略，使得敌人一败涂地；主动进攻，就要打歼灭战。对敌人，我们决不手软，决不姑息，不打则已，打则必胜。
    林副主席指出：“毛泽东思想指引下的人民革命是历史前进的火车头。”战无不胜的毛泽东思想是战胜阶级敌人最强大的思想武器。毛主席最尊重群众的首创精神，及时总结亿万群众的革命经验，深刻揭示阶级斗争的规律，不断发出战斗号召，采取英明措施，指引着我们向阶级敌人冲锋陷阵。在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，毛主席又发出了英明指示，使我们斗争目标更加清楚，方向更加明确。毛主席这一最新指示被亿万群众所掌握，就会汇成巨大的物质力量，在向阶级敌人主动进攻中，所向披靡，攻无不克，战无不胜。
    “大海航行靠舵手，干革命靠毛泽东思想。”对于伟大统帅毛主席最近发出的最新指示，我们一定要以最大的决心，最高的热情，最快的速度，学习、宣传和贯彻执行，进一步提高阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟，打倒山头主义、宗派主义、右倾分裂主义，反对两面派，坚决打击右倾翻案风，深入持久地开展革命大批判，彻底粉碎阶级敌人动摇和分裂以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的一切罪恶阴谋。紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，从思想上、政治上、经济上、组织上夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
