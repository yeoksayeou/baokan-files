The new wave of black resistance in the United States, which erupted on the evening of April 4, quickly spread to over forty cities, including Washington, New York, and Chicago, on April 5. Groups of black people took to the streets, defying the brutal suppression by the military and police, trampling underfoot the "laws" and "order" that maintain the interests of monopoly capital, and striking fear into the hearts of white racists and exploiters.

In Washington, over the past two days, black masses have shown a fearless and courageous spirit of struggle, turning the heart of the imperialist empire and the lair of white racial oppressors into a scene of chaos. On April 5, despite a heavy downpour, groups of angry black people, regardless of age or gender, chanted slogans against racial discrimination and demanding black power, surging from black residential areas towards the city center. The windows of many white-owned stores in the commercial district were smashed to pieces. The entire city had 180 fires; near the Capitol, thick smoke filled the air, and cars had to drive with their headlights on during the day. In the bustling areas east of the White House and some major commercial districts, dozens of fires raged, sending smoke billowing into the sky.

In the second-largest city in the United States, Chicago, the wave of black resistance swept through the entire city. The city had dozens of fires, and thick smoke could be seen everywhere. Angry black masses intercepted cars driven by white racists on the streets, striking them with bricks and glass bottles. The reactionary authorities, in order to monitor and suppress the blacks, deployed 8,000 National Guards around the black areas and sent armored vehicles patrolling the streets. However, brave black snipers continued to fire until late at night, forcing the military and police to hide in their posts, daring not to show their heads.

In Detroit, the fifth-largest city in the United States, where the largest-scale black armed resistance in American history erupted last summer, black masses attacked white cars with bricks and stones and set fire to the stores of white exploiters. Two police officers patrolling the black area were shot and injured by black snipers. The reactionary city authorities were in a state of panic, repeatedly appealing to the governor for help. Governor Romney hurriedly dispatched 400 state police and 3,000 National Guards to strengthen the suppression, and ordered another 9,000 National Guards to be on standby.

In Memphis, Tennessee, the black masses' resistance continued throughout the day on April 5. The police authorities sent helicopters to hover over the black areas at low altitudes to threaten and monitor, but were shot at by black snipers. The black masses also shot at a police car, injuring two police officers.

In Greensboro, North Carolina, black snipers fired at the police from a university dormitory, injuring three police officers.

In New York, despite the threat and suppression by tens of thousands of military and police, 7,000 black masses, with the support of white masses, held a march and demonstration against racist atrocities.

Facing the powerful storm of black resistance across the country, Johnson was terrified. On April 5, he exclaimed that Washington had fallen into a state of "chaos" and that the police force was unable to cope with the situation. This head of the U.S. empire, with a ferocious look, ordered the deployment of a large number of military and police, and authorized the Secretary of Defense to "if necessary" send regular troops to suppress the black masses.

The black resistance triggered by the assassination of black pastor Martin Luther King Jr. was so rapid and intense, reflecting that the broad black masses in the United States had reached a point of intolerable oppression and exploitation by the American ruling class. The anger accumulated in the hearts of the black masses was like a powder keg, and a single spark could cause an explosion. The failure of non-violent action advocate Martin Luther King Jr., who was killed by white racists, made the broad black masses in the United States once again see the bankruptcy of non-violence. As the young black leader Carmichael said, "What we need now is guns, more guns."

    美国黑人武力抗暴斗争气势迅猛  斗争风暴迅速扩展到四十多个城市
    约翰逊被吓得心惊胆战，惊呼华盛顿已陷于“混乱状态”
    新华社六日讯　华盛顿消息：四日晚上掀起的美国黑人抗暴斗争的新风暴，在五日迅速扩展到包括华盛顿、纽约、芝加哥等大城市在内的四十多个城市。成群的黑人涌上街头，不顾军警的血腥镇压，把维护垄断资本利益的“法律”和“秩序”踏在脚下，把白人种族主义者和剥削者吓得魂不附体。
    在华盛顿，两天来，黑人群众发扬不畏强暴、英勇斗争的精神，把这个帝国主义的心脏、白人种族压迫者的老巢打得七零八落。五日，虽然下了一场大雨，一群群愤怒的黑人群众不分男女老少，高呼着反对种族歧视、要求黑人权力的口号，从黑人居住区涌向市中心。商业中心白人商店的许多橱窗被砸得粉碎。全市共有一百八十处起火；在国会大厦附近浓烟迷漫，汽车在白天要开着灯才能行驶。在白宫以东的闹市区和一些主要的商业区，几十处燃起大火，烟雾冲天。
    在美国第二大城市芝加哥，黑人武力抗暴斗争的浪潮席卷整个城市。全城有数十处起火，到处可以看到一股股的浓烟。愤怒的黑人群众在大街上拦截白人种族主义者的汽车，用砖头和玻璃瓶予以痛击。反动当局为了对黑人进行监视和镇压，在黑人区周围布置了八千名国民警卫队，还出动了装甲车在街上巡逻。但是，勇敢的黑人狙击手直到深夜还不断开枪射击，迫使军警龟缩在哨所里，不敢探头。
    在去年夏天曾经爆发美国历史上规模空前的黑人武装抗暴斗争的美国第五大城市底特律，黑人群众用砖头石块袭击白人的汽车，放火烧毁白人剥削者的商店。两名在黑人区巡逻的警官，被黑人狙击手开枪打伤。反动的市当局惊慌失措，不断向州长告急求援。州长罗姆尼慌忙调动四百名州警察和三千名国民警卫队前去加强镇压，同时下令另外九千名国民警卫队处于戒备状态。
    在田纳西州的孟菲斯城，黑人群众的武力抗暴斗争在五日延续了一整天。警察当局派出直升飞机在黑人区低空盘旋，进行威胁和监视，遭到黑人狙击手的射击。黑人群众还开枪击中一辆警车，打伤两名警察。
    在北卡罗来纳州的格林斯博罗，黑人狙击手从一所大学的学生宿舍里同警察开枪互射，打伤三名警察。
    在纽约，不顾数万名军警的威胁和镇压，七千黑人群众在白人群众的支持下，举行了反对种族主义暴行的游行示威。
    面对着全国各地黑人抗暴斗争的强大风暴，约翰逊吓得胆战心惊。他在五日惊呼华盛顿已经陷于“混乱状态”，“警察部队无力应付局势”。这个美帝头子凶相毕露地下令出动大批军警，并且授权国防部长“在必要时”出动正规部队对黑人群众进行镇压。
    由于黑人牧师马丁·路德·金遇刺身死而触发的这次美国黑人抗暴斗争，来势如此迅猛，反映了美国广大黑人群众对于美国统治阶级对他们的残酷剥削和压迫已到了忍无可忍的地步。黑人群众心中郁积的愤怒犹如一座火药库，一点火星就可以引起一场爆炸。主张非暴力行动的马丁·路德·金死于白人种族主义者的暴力，使美国广大黑人群众又一次看到非暴力主义的破产。美国黑人青年领袖卡迈克尔说得好：“我们现在需要的是枪，更多的枪。”
