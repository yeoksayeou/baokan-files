The Afro-Asian Writers' Association issued a statement on April 14 firmly supporting the struggle of American blacks against racial oppression by American imperialism.

The statement mentioned the assassination of Martin Luther King, a representative of non-violence, during the American blacks' struggle against violence, and pointed out that this incident reminds us of the lesson: to achieve true liberation, revolutionary violence must be used to counter revolutionary violence. The widespread violent struggles across the United States show that American blacks are increasingly aware of this historical truth.

The statement said that the panic-stricken Johnson administration has mobilized 55,000 troops and National Guardsmen to suppress the escalating struggle. There are reports that another 22,000 troops are on standby. This clearly shows the strength of American blacks and the weakness of American imperialists. At a time when American imperialist invaders are suffering defeats in Vietnam and facing an unprecedented economic crisis sweeping the entire capitalist world, this situation will accelerate the inevitable failure of American imperialism.

The statement said, as Chairman Mao pointed out: "The fascist atrocities of American imperialism against blacks have exposed the true nature of American so-called democracy and freedom, revealing the inherent connection between the reactionary policies of the American government at home and its aggressive policies abroad."

The statement finally called on all revolutionary and progressive writers and people to fully support the just struggle of American blacks against racial oppression and imperialist rule.

	New China News Agency, Tirana, April 14 - The Albanian newspaper "Unity" published a commentary on April 14, enthusiastically hailing the surging struggle of American blacks and the anti-imperialist national liberation struggles of various countries.

	The commentary said that the struggle of American blacks against violence shows that blacks are awakening. They are increasingly convinced that only by uniting and taking up arms to fight against the Johnson administration can blacks win their rights. The struggle of blacks for their rights is increasingly combining with political struggle, with the struggle against the oppression, exploitation, and war policies pursued by the U.S. imperialists at home and abroad. The flames of the black struggle sweeping across the United States are unquenchable. The commentary said that today, not only in the United States but around the world, the struggle against American imperialists is surging. The peoples of various countries are increasingly seeing that American imperialists are their most vicious enemies. Oppressed nations and peoples are taking up arms, further expanding and strengthening the armed struggle against American aggressors and their lackeys.

	The commentary pointed out that the armed struggle of the revolutionary peoples of various countries against imperialism is surging, and the situation is excellent. Bourgeois politicians, Social Democrats, and modern revisionists are desperately spreading the ghostly talk of surrendering to imperialism, but no one believes it anymore. Only by taking up arms and engaging in armed struggle can imperialists and their lackeys be thoroughly defeated and eliminated, and the rightful rights be won. The peoples of various countries have realized from their own struggle experience that they must use revolutionary violence to counter imperialist counter-revolutionary violence, otherwise they cannot gain freedom and independence.

	The commentary concluded that the liberation struggles of the peoples of various countries are an integral part of the current revolutionary struggle against imperialism led by the United States, and they are fundamentally shaking the entire colonial system, heralding the inevitable collapse of the colonial system and the imminent arrival of new victories for the world revolution.

    据新华社十四日讯　亚非作家常设局十四日发表声明，坚决支持美国黑人反对美帝国主义种族压迫的斗争。
    声明谈到了在美国黑人抗暴斗争中，非暴力代表马丁·路德·金被暗害，并指出，这使人想起这样的教训：为了取得真正的解放，必须以革命的暴力来对付反革命的暴力。遍及美国全国各地的暴力斗争证明，美国黑人越来越意识到这一历史真理。
    声明说，惊慌失措的约翰逊帝国主义政府调集了五万五千名军队和国民警卫队来镇压正在日益高涨的斗争。有消息说，还有两万两千名军队处于一等战斗准备状态。这清楚表明了美国黑人的力量和美帝国主义者的虚弱。正当美帝国主义侵略者在越南战场上遭到节节失败和它正面临席卷整个资本主义世界的空前的经济危机的时候，出现了这种局势，将加速美帝国主义的不可避免的失败。
    声明说，正如毛主席所指出的：“美国帝国主义对黑人的法西斯暴行，揭穿了美国的所谓民主和自由的本质，暴露了美国政府在国内的反动政策和在国外的侵略政策之间的内在联系。”
    声明最后号召全体革命的进步的作家和人民，全力支持美国黑人反对种族压迫和帝国主义统治的正义斗争。
    新华社地拉那十四日电　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》十四日发表评论，热烈欢呼美国黑人斗争和各国人民反帝民族解放斗争风起云涌的大好形势。
    评论说，美国黑人的抗暴斗争表明黑人正在觉醒。他们更加相信，只有团结起来，拿起武器，同约翰逊政府进行斗争，黑人才能赢得自己的权利。黑人为争取自己权利的斗争正在同政治斗争，同反对美帝在国内外推行的压迫、剥削和战争政策的斗争更好地结合起来。席卷美国的黑人斗争烈火是扑不灭的。评论说，今天，不仅在美国，而且在世界各地，反对美帝国主义者的斗争正在日益高涨。各国人民越来越清楚地看到，美帝国主义者是他们最凶恶的敌人。被压迫民族和被压迫人民正在拿起武器，进一步扩大和加强反对美国侵略者及其走狗的武装斗争。
    评论指出，各国革命人民的反帝武装斗争正在日益高涨，形势大好。资产阶级政客、社会民主党人和现代修正主义者拚命散布向帝国主义妥协投降的鬼话，再也没人相信了。只有拿起枪杆子，进行武装斗争，才能彻底打败和消灭帝国主义者及其走狗，赢得应有的权利。各国人民从自己的斗争经验中认识到，必须用革命的暴力去反对帝国主义的反革命暴力，否则就不能获得自由和独立。
    评论最后说，各国人民的解放斗争，是当前反对以美国为首的帝国主义的整个革命斗争的组成部分，它正在从根本上动摇整个殖民体系，并预示着殖民体系必将覆灭，世界革命的新胜利必将来临。
