On the banks of the Gan River, beneath Mount Jinggang, there is such a factory—the state-owned Hongdu Machinery Factory—and such a force—a proletarian revolutionary industrial army. They harbor such an ideal—the sole purpose of liberating all of humanity.

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they forged peaks of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao with every beating heart. With their boundless loyalty to the cause of liberating all humanity, they composed one moving anthem after another.

	For the Liberation of All Humanity, They Unite and Fight

Chairman Mao said: "We are not uniting and fighting for the private interests of a few people or a narrow clique, but for the interests of the broad masses of the people, for the interests of the entire nation."

Following Chairman Mao's great teachings, the proletarian class of the Hongdu Machinery Factory, in the fierce class struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, early on united into a revolutionary steel army!

The workshop that first achieved revolutionary great unity in the entire factory originally had five mass organizations. During the revolutionary great unity, the large organization said: "In our workshop, our organization is the largest, but without the seven hundred million people, it is so insignificant!" The small organization said: "Our organization is small, but if we join the 'three billion,' our power will be boundless!" Regardless of the size of the organization, they were the first in the entire factory to establish a unified organization by workshop, and they issued an initiative to the entire factory to achieve revolutionary great unity from the bottom up by workshop and department. Thus, in a short time, the entire factory united from the bottom up and established a unified revolutionary mass organization—the Jinggangshan Corps.

In the surging tide of revolutionary great unity, they also encountered a small backflow. A handful of stubborn reactionary elements incited some people who clung to their small hills and spread rumors such as "with me as the core" and "such a unity is unreasonable," and so on. "What 'with me as the core'! The core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China, and the theoretical foundation guiding our thoughts is Marxism-Leninism, the great thought of Mao Zedong!" "What is unreasonable, what is illegal?! Liberating all humanity is our highest ideal. Engaging in revolutionary great unity is reasonable; creating small hills is unreasonable!" Those who clung to their small hills encountered obstacles wherever they went, and wherever they went, the workers surrounded them for debate. Their "theories" found no sympathy, and their "actions" found no support.

The revolutionary workers of the Hongdu Machinery Factory wrote Chairman Mao's teachings on liberating all humanity either reverently in notebooks or neatly on the walls. A party branch secretary in one unit had implemented the bourgeois reactionary line and once labeled an old worker as a "counter-revolutionary." In such a situation, the old worker did not think of himself but of the branch secretary who had made the mistake. He repeatedly told the secretary: "You labeled me as a 'counter-revolutionary,' and I do not hold a grudge. But what pains me is that you have betrayed Chairman Mao's teachings, confused friend and foe, and placed yourself on the enemy's side." Following Chairman Mao's teaching of "not only looking at a cadre's one-time or one-event performance but also at the cadre's entire history and entire work," the old worker, after making a comprehensive analysis of the branch secretary, voluntarily formed a "red pair" with him. Once, twice, dozens of times he went to talk to him; once, twice, dozens of times they studied Chairman Mao's works together. In this way, day after day, with the sincere help of this old worker and other revolutionary workers, the branch secretary finally returned to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. One day, the branch secretary, holding a statue of Chairman Mao with both hands, came to the old worker's home, tears welling up in his eyes, saying: "Chairman Mao saved me, and the revolutionary workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought helped me. I thank Chairman Mao and the worker comrades!" The old worker, with tears of excitement rolling down, said: "We are class brothers, comrades fighting together for the liberation of all humanity!"

The proletarian class of the Hongdu Machinery Factory, with such a broad heart, magnificent spirit, and noble thoughts, helped one cadre after another return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Now, the vast majority of the middle-level cadres in the entire factory have been liberated, and most of them have participated in the revolutionary "three-in-one" leadership teams at various levels.

	Great Ideals Produce Great Power

Chairman Mao said: "The correct ideology representing the advanced class, once grasped by the masses, will become a material force to transform society and the world."

The proletarian class of the Hongdu Machinery Factory, with the ideal of liberating all humanity, directed the boundless enthusiasm and infinite wisdom unleashed in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into production, making the production front bloom with red flowers everywhere.

The workers in the casting workshop, through collective wisdom, overcame a technical difficulty that had not been solved for many years, doubling production twice; the workers in the research and development section used every means to find shortcuts and tap potential, increasing equipment utilization by one and a half times; ... This year, new records, new achievements, and new products are increasing more and more. The revolutionary workers of the Hongdu Machinery Factory have firmly grasped the fate of the proletarian dictatorship, the fate of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the fate of the socialist economy in their own hands, each striving to be a revolutionary pioneer and a production model. On the eve of the "January Revolution" storm of last year, the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, on the verge of annihilation, made a desperate struggle. They incited some deceived masses to leave their production posts, attempting to achieve their evil purpose of disrupting the revolution by disrupting production. At this critical moment, the revolutionary workers of the Hongdu Machinery Factory saw through the enemy's tricks. In the situation where many deceived masses had left their production posts, they said with revolutionary enthusiasm: "No matter how great the difficulties, we will overcome them! No matter how heavy the burden, we will carry it!" They united as one, and when there were fewer people, one person did the work of several, one shift did the work of several shifts. When the machine tool workshop was trying out a new type of milling machine, it was precisely when the capitalist roaders were madly carrying out a "counter-revolutionary encirclement and suppression." The workers said: "No matter what storms and waves appear, production must not stop!" They organized two teams, one for self-defense and factory protection, and one for the milling machine. Some workers worked on the revolution during the day and worked overtime at night; some worked on factory protection at night and came to the workshop to attack technical difficulties during the day. The entire workshop fought day and night, finally successfully trying out the new type of milling machine in the midst of the fiercest struggle. People praised it as a "red flower" blooming in the fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The revolutionary workers of the Hongdu Machinery Factory, in the fierce class struggle and production struggle, acted as masters of the house, showing a high degree of revolutionary self-awareness. They best understood Chairman Mao's teaching of "the army advances, production increases by an inch, discipline is strengthened, and the revolution is invincible," and consciously followed revolutionary discipline. Here, whoever did not follow revolutionary discipline would be resisted, and whoever tried to find "basis" for their wrong words and deeds would be severely criticized. In one workshop, someone did a bit of personal business during work hours, and an old worker went up to criticize and stop him without hesitation. That person, not convinced, said: "Who are you?" The old worker, with a clear conscience, said: "Acting according to Mao Zedong Thought is the boss! You are wrong, so I can manage you." With such workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, anarchism and counter-revolutionary economism found no market here!

"These people are not arrogant elements or opportunists, but are down-to-earth people full of practical spirit." The proletarian class of the Hongdu Machinery Factory, with their outstanding performance in completing foreign aid tasks, showed that they are truly the kind of people Chairman Mao talked about.

At the crucial moment of welcoming the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they accepted an urgent task to aid Albania. Their hearts were filled with excitement. They seemed to hear Chairman Mao saying to the comrades of Albania: "We are your true friends and comrades," and they seemed to see the factories in Albania that had already been completed, waiting for our tools. Their hearts soared over mountains and rivers, closely embracing the hearts of the heroic comrades in the land of the eagles. They turned their deep affection for the Albanian comrades into down-to-earth actions.

When they accepted this task, it was already December 26, 1967, and the year-end deadline was approaching. Deducting transportation time, the actual production time was only a few short days. Time was tight, and the task was heavy. But they had only one thought: "No matter how tight the time, we must complete it ahead of schedule." They said: "Completing it one day ahead means Albania's factory can start one day earlier, which is a heavy blow to imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries." Under the inspiration of this sublime internationalist spirit, they displayed the spirit of fearing no fatigue and fighting continuously, working day and night. In just fifty-five hours, they successfully completed the task. They played a new anthem of the fighting friendship between the Chinese and Albanian peoples.

	To Liberate All Humanity, One Must First Liberate Oneself from "Self"

The proletarian class of the Hongdu Machinery Factory, their great ideal of liberating all humanity, comes from the great thought of Mao Zedong. They say that to liberate all humanity, one must first be a "liberated person," a proletarian revolutionary warrior liberated from the shackles of "self." They regard the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as the best classroom for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. After the latest instructions from the great leader Chairman Mao on holding study classes were issued, in the Hongdu Machinery Factory, from the factory department to the workshops, from the employees to the families, study classes of Mao Zedong Thought were held everywhere, and everyone participated in the study. They regarded the study classes as a battlefield for criticizing and repudiating oneself and striving to climb the peak of the worldview of "publicness."

In every workshop, there is a group of revolutionary warriors who were the first to "emerge." When the revolutionary committee was to be established, the masses nominated them as candidates, but they voluntarily persuaded the masses who supported them to recommend those who were more suitable than themselves to be elected into the revolutionary committee. They said: "We proletarian class struggle not for personal positions, but for the liberation of all humanity. Whatever is beneficial to the revolution, we do it!"

Revolution is not for the sake of holding positions, but when the revolution needs it, true revolutionaries must bravely shoulder heavy responsibilities. Comrade Wan Liliang, the main leader of the Jinggangshan Corps of the Hongdu Machinery Factory, is such a brave warrior who can both go down and dare to go up.

When the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Jiangxi entered the most arduous decisive battle, many brother organizations requested the Hongdu Machinery Factory to send capable leaders to take on the heavy responsibility of the provincial revolutionary liaison committee. The Jinggangshan Corps of the Hongdu Machinery Factory decided to send Comrade Wan Liliang, the general commander.

In those days and nights when dark clouds pressed down on the city, the Jiangxi Provincial Revolutionary Liaison Committee not only had to fight to the death with the class enemy but also had to resist the impact and interference of the ultra-leftist tide. Some people, manipulated by the dark hands, wanted to destroy the revolutionary great unity that had just formed, driving the propaganda car to the gate and publicly insulting Comrade Wan Liliang by name, calling him a "rightist capitulationist traitor." He thought of Chairman Mao, thought of the people of the entire province, thought of ... He could withstand any pressure and endure any humiliation. With his broad revolutionary heart, he patiently educated and helped those deceived masses, finally uniting and winning them over.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Jiangxi finally achieved decisive victory, and the Jiangxi Revolutionary Committee was established. Wan Liliang, this ordinary worker, took on the position of deputy director of the Jiangxi Revolutionary Committee. His burden became heavier, and his requirements for himself became stricter. Now, he pays more attention to using Mao Zedong Thought to transform his soul, maintaining close ties with the masses, and is determined to carry the revolutionary burden even better. In mass meetings, he openly exposes his private thoughts without fear of shame, good at seizing "fleeting thoughts," and criticizes himself without fear of pain. He insists on frequently returning to the workshop to labor and talk with the workers. The workers, as before, affectionately call him "Old Wan" and "Master Wan."

"We communists are not seeking office but seeking revolution." Old worker Gu Jinshi, who had suffered much bitterness in the old society, from the first day he took on the position of a member of the factory revolutionary committee, used Chairman Mao's teachings to ring the alarm for himself. He was in charge of production logistics. Following Chairman Mao's teaching of "serving the people wholeheartedly and never leaving the masses," he resolutely got rid of the office arranged for him, went among the masses, carefully listened to the masses' opinions, consulted with the masses on matters, and handled many tasks cleanly and efficiently in the workshops and by the machines. The workshops became his "office," and the masses became his "chief of staff." He threw himself into the revolutionary masses' vast and vigorous world.

Zhu Guirong is a young female worker of only twenty-one years old. Before the Cultural Revolution, she worked diligently and quietly served the collective and the masses, being evaluated as a "five-good worker" year after year. People called her "Little Lei Feng." But at that time, she only saw her workshop and factory, and only cared about the work of her small group and the surrounding comrades. The blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution opened her horizons. She began to think about how to keep our country from changing color forever and how to dedicate herself to the world revolution and the cause of human liberation.

Composed of many such excellent proletarian revolutionary fighters, the proletarian class of the Hongdu Machinery Factory is following Chairman Mao's teaching of "the proletarian class must continuously learn in work, gradually overcome their shortcomings, and never stop" to be humble and cautious, guard against arrogance and impatience, advance with victory, and is determined to achieve new victories in the struggle for the comprehensive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    他们在实践自己的崇高理想
    ——记江西洪都机械厂工人阶级在无产阶级文化大革命中的战斗篇章
    在赣江之滨，井冈山下，有这样一个工厂——国营洪都机械厂，有这样一支队伍——无产阶级革命的产业大军，他们胸怀这样一个理想——唯一的为着全人类的解放。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，他们用颗颗红心铸造着对伟大领袖毛主席的忠字高峰，他们用对全人类解放事业的无限忠诚，谱写着一曲曲动人心弦的凯歌。
      为着解放全人类而结合，而战斗
    毛主席说：我们“不是为着少数人的或狭隘集团的私利，而是为着广大人民群众的利益，为着全民族的利益，而结合，而战斗的。”
    遵照毛主席的伟大教导，洪都机械厂的工人阶级在无产阶级文化大革命的激烈阶级斗争中，很早就联合成一支革命的钢铁大军！
    全厂最早实现革命大联合的一个车间，原来有五个群众组织。在革命大联合中，大组织说：“在我们车间里，我们组织虽然最大，但是离开了七亿人民，又是多么渺小！”小组织说：“我们组织虽小，但是跨进了
  ‘三十亿’，力量就大无比！”他们不分组织大小，在全厂第一个按车间成立了统一组织，并且向全厂发出按车间、科室自下而上实现革命大联合的倡议。于是，在短时间内全厂就自下而上联合起来，成立了全厂统一的革命群众组织——井冈山兵团。
    在奔腾的革命大联合洪流中，他们也曾遇到一股小小逆流。一小撮顽固不化的走资派挑拨一些死抱着小山头不放的人，散布什么“以我为核心”呀，“这样的联合不合理”啦，等等。“什么以我为核心！领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党，指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义，是伟大的毛泽东思想！”“什么不合理，什么不合法！？解放全人类，是我们最高的理想。搞革命的大联合，就是有理；闹小山头，就是没有理！”抱着小山头不放的人走到哪里就在哪里碰壁，走到哪里，哪里的工人们就围住他辩论。他们的“理论”没有人同情，他们的“行动”没有人支持。
    洪都机械厂的革命工人把毛主席关于解放全人类的教导，或恭恭敬敬地写在本子上，或端端正正地贴在墙上。有个单位的党支部书记执行了资产阶级反动路线，曾经把一个老工人打成“反革命”。在这种情况下，这个老工人想的不是自己，而是那个犯了错误的支部书记。他不止一次地对支书说：你把我打成“反革命”，我不计较。可是我痛心的是你辜负了毛主席的教导，敌我不分，使你自己站在敌人的立场上去了。这个老工人遵照毛主席“不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作”的教导，对党支部书记作了全面分析以后，便主动地和他结成“一对红”。一次、两次、几十次地找他谈心；一遍、两遍、几十遍地和他共同学习毛主席著作。这样一年如一日，在这个老工人和其他革命工人的热诚帮助下，这个党支部书记终于回到了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。一天，党支部书记双手捧着一尊毛主席塑像，来到这位老工人家里，满含着热泪说：“毛主席救了我，用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命工人帮助了我。我感谢毛主席，谢谢工人同志们！”老工人也滚动着兴奋的泪水说：“我们是阶级兄弟，是为着解放全人类而共同奋斗的同志啊！”
    洪都机械厂的工人阶级就是以这样宽广的胸怀，豪迈的气魄，崇高的思想，帮助一个个犯了错误的干部回到了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。现在，全厂绝大部分的中层干部已经解放出来，其中多数人还参加了各级革命“三结合”的领导班子。
      伟大的理想产生伟大的力量
    毛主席说：“代表先进阶级的正确思想，一旦被群众掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的物质力量。” 
    以解放全人类为理想的洪都工人阶级，把无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲和无穷智慧，用在生产上，使生产战线上红花遍地开。
    铸造车间的工人，群策群力，攻克了一项多年未攻克的技术难关，使产量翻了两番；科研工段的工人们千方百计找窍门，挖潜力，使设备利用率提高一倍半；……今年，新纪录、新成绩、新产品更是越来越多。洪都机械厂革命工人把无产阶级专政的命运，把无产阶级文化大革命的命运，把社会主义经济的命运，紧紧地掌握在自己手里，个个争当革命的闯将、生产的模范。去年“一月革命”风暴的前夕，濒临灭亡的党内一小撮走资派，进行了垂死挣扎。他们煽动一部分受蒙蔽的群众离开生产岗位，妄图以破坏生产来达到破坏革命的罪恶目的。在这紧要关头，洪都机械厂革命工人心明眼亮，一眼就看穿了敌人的诡计。在许多受蒙蔽群众离开了生产岗位的情况下，他们满怀革命豪情地说：“天大的困难，我们顶！万斤重担，我们挑！”他们团结一致，人少了，就一人顶几人，一班顶几班。机修车间试制新型铣床时，正值走资派疯狂进行反革命“围剿”，工人们说：“不管出现什么惊涛骇浪，生产决不能停下来！”他们组织两批人马，一批自卫护厂，一批突击铣床。有些工人白天搞革命，晚上加班到深夜；有的晚上护厂值勤，白天又来车间猛攻技术关键。整个车间夜以继日地连续苦战，终于在斗争最激烈的时候，新型铣床试制成功。人们赞誉它是盛开在无产阶级文化大革命战火中的“红花”。
    洪都机械厂的革命工人在激烈的阶级斗争和生产斗争中，当管家，做主人，表现了高度的革命自觉性。他们最理解毛主席关于“军队向前进，生产长一寸，加强纪律性，革命无不胜”的教导，自觉地遵守革命纪律。在这里，谁要不遵守革命纪律，谁就会受到抵制，谁想强词夺理为自己的错误言行找“根据”，谁就会受到严肃批评。有一个车间，有个人在上班时间干了一点私事，一位老工人毫不留情地前去批评制止。那个人不服气地说：“你算老几？”这位老工人理直气壮地说：“按毛泽东思想办事就是老大！你做的不对，就可以管。”有了这样用毛泽东思想武装起来的工人阶级，什么无政府主义，什么反革命经济主义，在这里都找不到市场！
    “这些人不是狂妄分子，也不是风头主义者，而是脚踏实地富于实际精神的人们。”洪都机械厂的工人阶级以出色完成援外任务的成绩表明，他们真正是毛主席所说的这种人。
    在迎接无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的关键时刻，他们接受了一项援助阿尔巴尼亚的紧急任务。他们的心情是何等的兴奋啊，他们仿佛听到毛主席在对阿尔巴尼亚的同志说：“我们是你们真正的朋友和同志”，他们仿佛看到，阿尔巴尼亚已经竣工的工厂，正在等待着我们的工具备件。他们的心越过万水千山，和山鹰之国的英雄战友的心紧紧地贴在了一起，他们把对阿尔巴尼亚战友的深情厚谊化为脚踏实地的行动。
    接受这项任务时，已是一九六七年十二月二十六日了，年底就要完成。除去运输时间，实际生产时间只有短短的三天。时间紧迫，任务繁重。但是，他们只有一个想法：“时间再紧，也得提早完成。”他们说：“提早一天完成，阿尔巴尼亚的工厂就能早一天开工，就是给帝修反的沉重打击。”在这种崇高的国际主义精神的鼓舞下，他们发扬了不怕疲劳，连续作战的精神，通宵达旦地进行战斗。总共只用了五十五个小时，就胜利地完成了任务。他们奏出了一支中阿人民战斗友谊的新凯歌。
  要解放全人类，先要从“我”字中解放自己
    洪都机械厂的工人阶级，他们解放全人类的伟大理想，来源于伟大的毛泽东思想。他们说，要解放全人类，首先自己要是个“解放人”，是个从“私”字的束缚中解放出来的无产阶级革命战士。他们把伟大的无产阶级文化大革命作为活学活用毛泽东思想的最好课堂。伟大领袖毛主席关于办学习班的最新指示传来以后，在洪都机械厂里，从厂部到车间，从职工到家属，到处都办起了毛泽东思想学习班，人人都参加了学习。他们把学习班作为斗私批修的战场，努力攀登着
  “公”字世界观的高峰。
    在每一个车间里，都有一批最早“杀”出来的革命战士。革命委员会要成立的时候，群众提出他们当候选人，他们却主动去说服支持自己的群众，推荐那些比自己更合适的同志选进革命委员会。他们说：“我们工人阶级争的不是个人当‘官’，而是全人类的解放。怎么有利于革命，我们就怎么干！”
    革命不是为了当官，可是当革命需要的时候，真正的革命者就要勇挑重担。洪都机械厂井冈山兵团主要负责人万里浪同志，就是这样一个既能下又敢上的英勇战士。
    当江西的无产阶级文化大革命进入了最艰苦的决战关头，许多兄弟组织要求洪都机械厂派出得力负责人，来挑省大联筹这副担子。洪都机械厂井冈山兵团决定，派总指挥万里浪同志去。
    在那黑云压城城欲摧的日日夜夜，江西省大联筹不仅要和阶级敌人作殊死的斗争，而且还要抵制极“左”思潮的冲击和干扰。有些人被黑手所利用，要搞垮刚刚形成的革命大联合，把宣传车开到大门口，对万里浪同志指名道姓地肆意辱骂，说他是“右倾投降变节分子”。他想到毛主席，想到全省人民，想到……，他什么压力都顶得住，什么委屈都受得了。他以宽广的革命胸怀，对这些受蒙蔽的群众，进行耐心的教育和帮助，终于把他们团结、争取过来。
    江西省无产阶级文化大革命终于取得了决定性胜利，江西省革委会成立了。万里浪，这个普通工人担任了省革委会副主任。他的担子更重了，他对自己的要求也更严了。现在，他更加注意用毛泽东思想改造自己的灵魂，和群众保持血肉的联系，决心把革命的担子挑得更好。他在群众大会上亮私不怕丑，善于抓住
  “一闪念”，斗私不怕疼。他坚持经常回车间劳动，跟工人谈心。工人们和以前一样，亲热地叫他“老万”“万师傅”。
      “我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命”。在旧社会饱尝辛酸的老工人顾金世，从担任厂革委会委员的第一天，就用毛主席的教导给自己敲起了警钟。他分工管生产后勤。他遵照毛主席“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众”的教导，坚决摆脱了给他安排的办公室，走到群众中去，细心倾听群众意见，遇事跟群众商量，把许多工作，在车间里、在机器旁，就干净利落地处理好了。车间成了他的“办公室”，群众成了他的“参谋长”，他投身在充满朝气的革命群众的大天地里。
    朱桂英是个年仅二十一岁的青年女工。文化大革命前，她踏踏实实地工作，不声不响地为集体、为群众服务，连年被评为“五好职工”，人们称她是“小雷锋”。但那时，她看到的还只是自己的车间、工厂，关心的还只是小组的工作和周围的同志。无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火，打开了她的视野。她开始考虑，我们国家如何永远不变颜色，自己如何为世界革命、人类解放事业而献身。
    由许许多多这样优秀的无产阶级革命派战士组成的洪都机械厂的工人阶级，他们正在遵照毛主席“工人阶级必须在工作中不断学习，逐步克服自己的缺点，永远也不能停止”的教导，谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，乘胜前进，决心在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的战斗中，再立新功！
