The Dongfeng Commune has linked its revolutionary criticism with the actual class struggle in its own unit, which is a good experience.

China's Khrushchev and other cliques of capitalist roaders within the Party, along with untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in society, collude and conspire together. They are the sworn enemies of the working class and poor and lower-middle peasants. For a long time, China's Khrushchev and the biggest clique of capitalist roaders within the Party have been able to push the counter-revolutionary revisionist line and engage in activities to restore capitalism. An important reason is that there are cliques of capitalist roaders and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in society who form their social base and cheer them on. Similarly, in some grassroots units, cliques of capitalist roaders and untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists are able to stir up trouble and commit evil deeds, attacking the socialist system and undermining the dictatorship of the proletariat. An important reason is that they have China's Khrushchev as their backer, supporting them from above. Linking revolutionary criticism with the actual class struggle in one's own unit is to uproot the roots of revisionism from top to bottom.

By combining revolutionary criticism with the class struggle in one's own region and unit, one can use the vivid reality of class struggle that the masses can see and touch to more powerfully arouse the masses' class hatred and organize millions of people to launch a fierce attack on the biggest clique of capitalist roaders within the Party. Let the masses be tempered in struggle and raise their consciousness.

By combining revolutionary criticism with the class struggle in one's own region and unit, one can both fire "high-caliber cannons" and use "machine guns" to elevate the various phenomena of class struggle in one's own unit to the level of the struggle between the two lines. This will be like striking from a high position and breaking through like a torrent, stripping away the enemy's disguise, and striking the enemy firmly, accurately, and ruthlessly. At the same time, only by combining revolutionary criticism with the class struggle in one's own unit can one cut off China's Khrushchev's tentacles reaching out to various regions and thoroughly purge the poison he has spread.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Class struggle is an objective existence that does not change with one's will. That is to say, it is inevitable. One's will may want to avoid it, but it is impossible. One can only follow the trend and lead it to victory." The closer the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution gets to complete victory, the sharper and more complex the class struggle becomes. We must closely watch the movements of the current class enemies, closely combine the exposure and smashing of the various plots and sabotage activities of local class enemies, and deeply and persistently carry out revolutionary criticism. We must plant the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought on every battlefield.

    革命大批判要和本单位阶级斗争相结合
    本报评论员
    东风公社联系本单位阶级斗争的实际，开展革命大批判，是一个好经验。
    中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派，社会上没有改造好的地富反坏右分子，互相勾结，狼狈为奸，是工人阶级和贫下中农的死对头。长期以来，中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派，所以能够推行反革命修正主义路线，大搞资本主义复辟活动，一个重要的原因，就是下面有一小撮走资派和社会上的地富反坏右分子，作他们的社会基础，为他们摇旗呐喊。同样，在一些基层单位，一小撮走资派和没有改造好的地富反坏右分子，所以能够兴风作浪，为非作歹，攻击社会主义制度，破坏无产阶级专政，一个重要的原因，也是有中国赫鲁晓夫做他们的靠山，在上面支持他们。联系本单位阶级斗争的实际，开展革命大批判，就是要把修正主义的祸根，从上到下，一起挖掉。
    把革命的大批判同本地区、本单位的阶级斗争结合起来，就能够用群众看得见、摸得着的活生生的阶级斗争的现实，更加有力地激发群众的阶级仇恨，把千百万群众组织到对党内最大的一小撮走资派的猛烈进攻中去，让群众在斗争中经受锻炼，提高觉悟。
    把革命的大批判，同本地区、本单位的阶级斗争结合起来，既放“高射炮”，又打“机关枪”，就能够把本单位阶级斗争的种种现象，提到两条路线斗争的高度，高屋建瓴，势如破竹，剥去敌人的伪装，又稳又准又狠地打击敌人。同时，也只有结合本单位的阶级斗争进行革命大批判，才能斩断中国赫鲁晓夫伸向各地区的魔爪，彻底肃清他所散布的流毒。
    毛主席教导我们说：“阶级斗争是客观存在，不依人的意志为转移的。就是说，不可避免的。人的意志想要避免，也不可能。只能因势利导，夺取胜利。”无产阶级文化大革命越是接近全面胜利，阶级斗争越是尖锐、复杂。我们应当密切注视当前阶级敌人的动向，紧密结合揭露和粉碎当地阶级敌人的种种阴谋破坏活动，深入持久地开展革命大批判，把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗插遍一切阵地。
