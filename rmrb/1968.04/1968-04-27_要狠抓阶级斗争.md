    We must grip class struggle firmly. The Chinese Khrushchev says: "The work of national construction is the central task of our Party throughout the country. We should shift the Party's and League's central work to national construction. There will be no more major movements in the future; we should concentrate our efforts on economic construction." Another top capitalist-roader in the Party also says: "We have been doing revolution in the past, and now the revolutionary tasks have been basically completed. The task now is to focus on construction." They want to make our youth forget about class struggle, forget about the dictatorship of the proletariat, not care about politics, and focus on production, so as to cultivate them into successors of the bourgeoisie and realize their dream of restoring capitalism.

    Under the poisonous influence of the Chinese Khrushchev's theory of "extinguishing class struggle," the work in our village once focused solely on production and neglected politics. At that time, class enemies were very rampant. A reactionary landlord shouted madly: "The Communist Party's regime cannot be established in one go." Class enemies also used telling "stories" and "jokes" to spread the ideas of capitulationism, seeking fame and profit, and obscene and indecent thoughts, poisoning and corrupting our youth.

    Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us that we must strengthen ideological and political education for the youth. Class struggle "must be talked about every year, every month, and every day." During the Four Clean-ups Movement and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we, the children of poor and lower-middle peasants, recalled our bitter family histories, arousing deep hatred towards class enemies. We exposed the counter-revolutionary words and deeds of the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party led by the Chinese Khrushchev and the reactionary landlords, and fought resolutely against them. The poor and lower-middle peasants stood tall, and the class enemies were disgraced.

    Without class struggle, production cannot be carried out well. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Class struggle, once grasped, is effective." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, we firmly grasped the line of class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, greatly raising the class consciousness of the youth, promoting the thought reform of people, and thus greatly arousing the enthusiasm of the youth for production. In 1967, our brigade achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. We delivered a large amount of surplus grain to the state, strongly supporting national construction.

    We revolutionary youth must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively participate in class struggle, grasp revolution, promote production, and forever follow the revolutionary road indicated by Chairman Mao!

    要狠抓阶级斗争
    北京市大兴县河北辛庄大队共青团批判小组
    中国赫鲁晓夫胡说什么：“国家建设工作，是我党在全国的中心工作，把党团中心工作转到国家建设上来。大的运动今后不可能有了，主要是集中精力搞经济建设。”党内另一个最大的走资派也胡说什么：“前一段干的是革命，现在革命任务已基本完成了，今后任务就是搞建设。”他们妄图使我们青年忘记阶级斗争，忘记无产阶级专政，不问政治，埋头生产，把我们青年培养成资产阶级的接班人，好让他们实现复辟资本主义的美梦。
    在中国赫鲁晓夫“阶级斗争熄灭”论的毒害下，我们村的工作曾经一度只抓生产，不抓政治。当时，阶级敌人极其猖獗。一个反动地主分子疯狂地叫嚣：“共产党江山不能一杆子插到底。”阶级敌人还利用讲“故事”、说“笑话”的方式，大肆宣扬投降主义、追名逐利和淫秽色情的思想，毒害和腐蚀我们青年。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们，必须对青年加强思想政治教育。阶级斗争“必须年年讲，月月讲，天天讲”。在四清运动和无产阶级文化大革命中，我们贫下中农子女回忆了自己苦难的家史，激起了对阶级敌人的深仇大恨。大家揭发了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派和反动地主分子的反革命言行，同他们进行了坚决的斗争。贫下中农扬眉吐气，阶级敌人威风扫地。
    不搞阶级斗争，生产是搞不好的。毛主席教导我们：“阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”遵照毛主席的教导，我们狠抓了阶级斗争、两条道路斗争这条纲，大大提高了青年的阶级觉悟，促进了人的思想革命化，从而大大激发了青年的生产积极性。一九六七年，我们大队获得了空前的大丰收。我们向国家交售了大量余粮，有力地支援了国家建设。
    我们革命青年一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，积极投入阶级斗争，狠抓革命，猛促生产，永远走毛主席指引的革命道路！
