The Anshan Municipal Revolutionary Committee, in accordance with the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching, "Never forget class struggle," is actively leading the broad revolutionary masses in deeply carrying out the revolutionary criticism and denouncement, continually launching attacks on class enemies. The entire steel city is presenting a thriving revolutionary scene.

After the Anshan Municipal Revolutionary Committee was born in the fierce struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, it led the revolutionary people of the entire city to continue launching fierce attacks on class enemies. The Municipal Revolutionary Committee, using the experience of class struggle since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, repeatedly reminded the members of various levels of revolutionary committees and the broad revolutionary masses of the city that the wind will not stop just because the tree wants to be still. In a confrontation between two armies, if you do not attack him, he will attack you; if you do not defeat him, he will defeat you. The struggle against the enemy must be an offensive battle. The broad revolutionary masses expressed their determination to firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching, "Absolutely do not relax your fighting will," to heighten class struggle awareness, and to launch unceasing attacks on the Chinese Khrushchov and his agents in Anshan, to carry out the revolutionary criticism and denouncement in a sustained and in-depth manner, and to thoroughly eliminate the poison of revisionism they spread.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people's democratic dictatorship needs the leadership of the working class. Because only the working class has the farthest vision, is the most selfless, and is the most thorough in revolution." The Anshan Municipal Revolutionary Committee remembers Chairman Mao's teaching and, in launching fierce attacks on class enemies, relies closely on the working class and fully plays the role of the backbone of the working class.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the working class of Anshan has always been at the forefront. Many veteran workers, in the revolutionary criticism and denouncement, with their personal experiences, denounced the evil old society and deeply exposed and criticized the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchov and his agents in Anshan attempting to restore capitalism. The veteran workers' boundless love and loyalty to Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and their deep hatred for the class enemies' schemes to restore capitalism, greatly educated the broad revolutionary masses, heightened the revolutionary masses' awareness of class struggle and line struggle, and pushed the revolutionary criticism and denouncement in the Anshan area to a new high. Some factories and mines organized the masses to go to the mass graves left over from the Japanese puppet Manchukuo period, where bones are piled up, to combine the remembrance of the bitterness of the old society with the sweetness of the new society with the criticism of the Chinese Khrushchov and other top walkers of the capitalist road within the party, with good effects. The veteran workers of Anshan Steel said: Every family has a bloody history. In the old society, we workers lived in dilapidated caves, ate acorn flour, and wore sackcloth. The Chinese Khrushchov and his agents in Anshan implemented the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, trying to drag us back to the old society, we absolutely do not agree, we absolutely do not agree! We will definitely follow Chairman Mao to make revolution with all our hearts! The revolutionary criticism and denouncement promoted various works, and the entire Anshan revolutionary production situation is excellent.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a great political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Communist Party of China and the broad revolutionary masses under its leadership and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Members of the Anshan Municipal Revolutionary Committee, in seriously studying and deeply understanding Chairman Mao's brilliant latest instructions, reviewed the practice of class struggle in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in this area, further realized: The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao has extremely profound and far-reaching significance for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing the restoration of capitalism, and ensuring that our party and country do not change color. The Anshan Municipal Revolutionary Committee is determined, under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, to lead the broad revolutionary masses to carry this political revolution of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes to the end. At present, the revolutionary criticism and denouncement on various fronts in Anshan are gradually deepening. The broad revolutionary masses, in the revolutionary criticism and denouncement, further heightened their awareness of class struggle and line struggle. They are determined, under the leadership of the Municipal Revolutionary Committee, to never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, never forget to emphasize politics, never forget to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to advance victoriously, to develop the excellent situation, and to seize comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in terms of ideology, politics, economy, and organization!

The revolutionary workers of the Locomotive Wheel Rim Factory, with Chairman Mao's latest instructions as their weapon, launched fierce attacks on the top walkers of the capitalist road within the party, headed by the Chinese Khrushchov, and their agents in this factory, and carried out the revolutionary criticism and denouncement in depth.

    鞍山市革委会率领全市人民向阶级敌人继续发动进攻
    充分发挥工人阶级的骨干作用
    各条战线革命大批判逐步深入
    新华社鞍山十七日电　鞍山市革命委员会遵照伟大领袖毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，积极领导广大革命群众深入开展革命大批判，向阶级敌人不断地展开进攻，整个钢城呈现着蓬蓬勃勃的革命景象。
    鞍山市革命委员会在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争中诞生以后，率领全市革命人民继续向阶级敌人展开猛烈进攻。市革命委员会运用无产阶级文化大革命以来阶级斗争实践的经验，一再提醒各级革命委员会成员和全市广大革命群众，树欲静而风不止。两军对垒，你不打他，他就打你，你不吃掉他，他就吃掉你。对敌斗争必须打主动战，打进攻战。广大革命群众表示，一定要牢牢记住毛主席关于“绝对不可以稍微松懈自己的战斗意志”的教导，提高阶级斗争观念，向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在鞍山的代理人不停顿地展开进攻，持久地深入地开展革命大批判，彻底肃清他们散布的修正主义流毒。
    毛主席教导我们：“人民民主专政需要工人阶级的领导。因为只有工人阶级最有远见，大公无私，最富于革命的彻底性。”鞍山市革命委员会牢记毛主席的教导，在向阶级敌人发动猛烈进攻中，紧紧依靠工人阶级，充分发挥工人阶级的骨干作用。
    在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，鞍山工人阶级一直站在最前列。很多老工人在革命的大批判中，以亲身的经历，控诉万恶的旧社会，深刻地揭露和批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其在鞍山的代理人妄图复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。老工人对毛主席、毛泽东思想、毛主席无产阶级革命路线的无限热爱、无限忠诚，对阶级敌人阴谋复辟资本主义的刻骨仇恨，极大地教育了广大革命群众，提高了革命群众阶级斗争和路线斗争的觉悟，把鞍山地区的革命大批判推向了一个新的高潮。有的厂矿组织群众到日寇伪满时期留下来的白骨累累的万人坑前，把忆旧社会的苦，思新社会的甜同批判中国赫鲁晓夫等党内最大的一小撮走资派结合起来，效果很好。鞍钢的老工人们说：我们家家都有一本血泪史。旧社会，我们工人住的是破窑洞，吃的是橡子面，披的是麻袋片。中国赫鲁晓夫及其在鞍山的代理人推行反革命修正主义路线，想把我们拉到旧社会去，我们一千个不答应，一万个不答应！我们就是要一心跟着毛主席干革命，海枯石烂不变心！革命的大批判推动了各项工作，整个鞍山革命生产形势一派大好。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”鞍山市革命委员会的成员在认真学习、深刻领会毛主席这一光辉的最新指示中，回顾了本地区无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践，进一步认识到：毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，对于巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，保证我们党和国家不变颜色，具有极其深远的伟大意义。鞍山市革命委员会决心在毛主席最新指示的光辉照耀下，带领广大革命群众，把当前这场无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命进行到底。目前，鞍山各条战线的革命大批判正在步步深入。广大革命群众在革命大批判中进一步提高了阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟。他们决心在市革命委员会的领导下，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，乘胜前进，发展大好形势，从思想上、政治上、经济上、组织上夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利！（附图片）
