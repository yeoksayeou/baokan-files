The heroic people and soldiers of Laos, since the beginning of this year, have displayed the immense power of people's war. They have launched widespread and continuous offensives, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy, striking the American aggressors and their lackeys, the right-wing forces of Laos, into a state of panic and disarray. This has brought about a new situation in the Lao people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation.

It is reported that in just the first two months of this year, the people and soldiers of Laos have annihilated over 5,300 enemy troops. This figure is equivalent to one-third of the total enemy casualties last year and is close to the total enemy casualties in the seven months of the dry season from 1966 to 1967. During this period, the people and soldiers of Laos also shot down and destroyed 25 enemy aircraft and seized a large amount of military supplies.

The sound of the people and soldiers of Laos fiercely attacking the enemy's guns and cannons began at the start of this year. From then on, from the upper reaches of the Mekong to the lower reaches, from the mountains to the plains, from the countryside to the towns, the people and soldiers of Laos launched attacks on the enemy everywhere, achieving one brilliant victory after another. Following the capture of the strategic stronghold of Nam Bao in the upper Mekong on January 14, where nearly 3,000 enemy troops were annihilated, the people and soldiers of Laos pressed on with their victories. On February 3, they launched a fierce attack on the three battalions of right-wing forces stationed in the Mangshan area south of the Xian Plain, quickly capturing the enemy's military headquarters and liberating the entire Mangshan area. In the lower Mekong, on February 23, the people and soldiers of Saravane Province launched a fierce assault on the enemy's 802nd Mobile Brigade's 2nd and 5th Airborne Battalions stationed in the Huinan Mountain and Bantakou areas, as well as the brigade's command post in the Nandong area, annihilating over 250 enemy troops. In addition, the people and soldiers of Laos have successively recovered Bat, Tatong, Tawen, Kanbong, Koudang, and other places, as well as the strategic stronghold of Huishan in the lower Mekong. Currently, the enemy forces in the major cities of Saravane, Attopeu, and Tchepone in the lower Mekong are heavily surrounded by the people's armed forces. The enemy troops trapped in the city are like rats in a trap, living in constant fear.

It is particularly worth mentioning that the combat effectiveness of the people and soldiers of Laos has rapidly improved, with more and more instances of annihilating entire battalions and regiments of the enemy. In the battle of Nam Bao, the people and soldiers of Laos almost completely annihilated the enemy's 11th Mobile Brigade and 25th Mobile Brigade.

Under the heavy blows of the people and soldiers of Laos, the morale of the right-wing forces of Laos has plummeted, and large numbers of enemy troops have surrendered to the people. On January 26, a company of puppet troops stationed in Sayaboury Province refused to follow the orders of reactionary officers to go out on "sweeping" operations. They turned their guns on the officers and subsequently, 21 soldiers surrendered to the people with their weapons.

Facing the fierce attacks of the people and soldiers of Laos, American imperialism and its Lao lackeys have issued a chorus of lamentations, crying that the situation in Laos is "rapidly deteriorating" and "cause for concern"; they lament that the offensive of the Lao people's armed forces is "much larger than in previous years," and the right-wing forces of Laos have "suffered a series of serious defeats and heavy casualties." However, as our great leader Chairman Mao has taught us, "All reactionary forces are doomed to die. They will inevitably resort to military adventurism and political deception in their final struggles to save themselves." To get out of their predicament, American imperialism has recently revealed its true colors as an aggressor, threatening that it "cannot ignore" the offensive of the people and soldiers of Laos, while at the same time stepping up the shipment of weapons and military personnel into Laos.

The heroic people of Laos, with their tradition of brave struggle, are highly alert to the plots of American imperialism and its lackeys to expand the war. They resolutely respond to the call of the Lao Patriotic Front and Prince Souphanouvong, displaying a spirit of brave fighting, fearlessness of sacrifice, and endurance of hardship. They are determined to deal a heavier blow to the enemy.

    人民战争威力巨大　打得敌人晕头转向
    老挝爱国军民两个月歼敌五千多
    爱国军民歼灭敌人整营整连，作战水平迅速提高
    据新华社三日讯　本社记者报道：英雄的老挝爱国军民，今年以来发挥人民战争的无比威力，接连主动广泛出击，痛歼敌人有生力量，打得美国侵略者及其走狗老挝右派军队惊慌万状、狼狈不堪，使老挝人民的抗美救国斗争出现了一个新局面。
    据公布，仅在今年头两个月里，老挝爱国军民就歼敌五千三百多名，这个数字相当于去年歼敌总数的三分之一，接近于一九六六年到一九六七年旱季七个月的歼敌总数。在此期间，老挝爱国军民还击落击毁敌机二十五架，缴获大量军用物资。
    老挝爱国军民猛烈进攻敌人的枪炮声，在今年年初开始就打响了。接着从上寮到下寮，从山区到平原，从农村到市镇，爱国军民到处出击敌人，取得一个又一个的光辉胜利。继一月十四日攻克上寮战略要地南博，歼敌近三千人以后，爱国军民乘胜前进，二月三日猛烈袭击驻扎在查尔平原以南芒岸地区的三营右派军队，迅速攻占敌人军事总部，一举解放了整个芒岸地区。在下寮，沙拉湾省爱国军民二月二十三日以凌厉的攻势，袭击驻扎在会南山和班塔古地区的敌军第八零二机动团的第二和第五空降营，以及在南顿地区的敌军第八零二机动团指挥部，一举歼敌二百五十多名。此外，爱国军民还先后收复了巴提、塔通、塔文、坎坊、科当等地以及下寮战略要地会山。目前，下寮重镇沙拉湾、阿速坡、他曲的敌军已被爱国武装力量重重包围。困守在城中的敌军，犹如瓮中之鳖，惶惶不可终日。
    值得特别提到的是，老挝爱国军民的作战水平，有了迅速的提高，整连整营地歼灭敌人的战例越来越多。南博一仗，爱国军民几乎全歼敌人第十一机动兵团和第二十五机动兵团。
    在爱国军民的沉重打击下，老挝右派军队士气严重低落，大批敌军向人民投诚。一月二十六日驻扎在沙耶武里省的一连伪军，反对反动军官强迫他们外出“扫荡”，毅然掉转枪口，向军官开火，随后又有二十一名士兵携械投向人民。
    面对爱国军民的猛烈进攻，美帝国主义和它的老挝走狗发出一片哀鸣，惊呼老挝局势“急转直下”，“令人不安”；哀叹老挝爱国武装力量的攻势“比前几年大得多”，老挝右派军队“遭到一系列严重的失败和重大伤亡”。但是，正如我们伟大领袖毛主席所教导的那样：“一切反动势力在他们行将灭亡的时候，总是要进行垂死挣扎的。他们必然要采取军事冒险和政治欺骗的种种手段，来挽救自己的灭亡。”美帝国主义为了摆脱困境，最近露出一副侵略强盗的凶相，叫嚷什么对爱国军民的攻势“不能不加以考虑”，同时加紧把武器、军事人员运进老挝。
    具有英勇斗争传统的老挝人民，对美帝国主义及其走狗扩大战争的阴谋，怀着高度的警惕，他们坚决响应老挝爱国战线党和苏发努冯亲王的号召，发扬英勇战斗，不怕牺牲、不怕艰苦的作风，决心给予敌人以更加沉重的打击。
