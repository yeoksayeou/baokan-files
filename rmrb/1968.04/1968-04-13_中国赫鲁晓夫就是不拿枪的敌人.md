	China's Khrushchev is the enemy who does not hold a gun
	Beijing Municipal Timber Factory Worker Cao Xizhen

	I was born into a poor family. At fourteen, my father passed away. In the old society, my two brothers, two sisters, and I could not eat or wear enough. We begged for food everywhere, and we could not even fill our stomachs with vegetable stalks. In 1947, the Liberation Army led by Chairman Mao came, and our hometown was liberated. We were given land and grain. At that time, I was seventeen years old and became the leader of the militia. Politically, I had turned over a new leaf. I knew then that I had to thank Chairman Mao and listen to the Party's words to do a good job. But as I went along, I was led astray by China's Khrushchev.

	Under the influence of China's Khrushchev's advocacy for "personal interests must be taken care of," this set of selfish black goods corrupted me. I thought of myself in everything. I thought I could earn some money and do some work, making my family better, but I forgot Chairman Mao's teaching that politics is the commander and the soul. My mind was muddled. Chairman Mao taught, "After the enemies with guns are eliminated, the enemies without guns still exist." Who are the enemies without guns? At that time, I did not know. This is how I was poisoned by China's Khrushchev and fell for his tricks.

	At that time, the factory was all about "material incentives" and bonuses. This was China's Khrushchev's trick. I was also poisoned. To get a little bonus, I did not care about the quality of the work. My mind was calculating the bonus, and I did not think about the Chinese revolution, the world revolution, or our lifeline—the dictatorship of the proletariat. Thinking back on those days, it was all because I lacked the soul of politics; I was confused. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution came, and I studied Chairman Mao's quotations and the "Three Articles." It touched my soul, my eyes were opened, and my direction became clear. Originally, the selfishness and counter-revolutionary economism that China's Khrushchev advocated were pure poisoned candy. Whoever eats it will be poisoned, will only care about personal immediate interests, will not care about politics, will forget the interests of the country and the collective, and will let China's Khrushchev and his gang successfully restore capitalism. It is truly a case of losing one's head without knowing how it was lost! How dangerous it is! Now I understand: the enemy without guns is China's Khrushchev! He is as bad as the enemy with guns. Down with China's Khrushchev!

### 中国赫鲁晓夫就是不拿枪的敌人

    中国赫鲁晓夫就是不拿枪的敌人 
    北京市木材厂工人　曹希真
    我是穷孩子出身。十四岁上父亲死了。在旧社会，我和两个兄弟、两个妹妹吃不上，穿不上，到处要饭，连菜帮子也吃不饱。一九四七年毛主席领导的解放军来了，家乡解放了，给我们分地又分粮食。那时我十七岁，当了民兵队长，政治上翻了身。我那时就知道要感谢毛主席，要听党的话，好好干。可是走着走着就被中国赫鲁晓夫拉到邪道上去了。
    在中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“个人利益一定要照顾”这套利己主义黑货的腐蚀下，我事事替自己打算。我认为自己能挣个钱、干个活了，把家庭弄得好好的，却把毛主席政治是统帅，是灵魂的教导忘了。脑瓜儿糊里糊涂。毛主席教导说：“在拿枪的敌人被消灭以后，不拿枪的敌人依然存在”。不拿枪的敌人是谁呀？那时我就不知道。这就中了中国赫鲁晓夫的毒，上了他的当。
    那时候工厂里尽搞“物质刺激”，搞奖金。这就是中国赫鲁晓夫那一套。我也中了毒，为了得点儿奖，就不管活儿的质量。脑子里盘算着的是奖金，什么中国革命、世界革命，还有我们的命根子——无产阶级专政，就不考虑了。自己想想过去的那些事，就是没有政治这个灵魂，就是糊涂。无产阶级文化大革命来了，我学了毛主席语录，学了“老三篇”，触及了我的灵魂，眼睛亮了，方向明了。原来中国赫鲁晓夫所宣扬的那一套利己主义和反革命经济主义，纯粹是蜜饯的砒霜。谁吃了它，谁就要中毒，谁就只顾个人眼前的利益，不关心政治，忘记国家和集体的利益，好让中国赫鲁晓夫一伙，顺利地复辟资本主义。真是连脑袋掉了还不知道怎么掉的！这是多么危险啊！这会儿我才明白：不拿枪的敌人就是中国的赫鲁晓夫！他和拿枪的敌人一样坏。打倒中国赫鲁晓夫！
