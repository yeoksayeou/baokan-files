The socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in our country is a very important and complex issue. Our great leader Chairman Mao brilliantly solved this problem, creating a successful experience of global significance in the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, greatly enriching and developing Marxism-Leninism.

The socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in our country is a sharp and complex class struggle. This revolution not only faced fierce resistance from the capitalists but also faced the desperate opposition of the representative of the bourgeoisie within the party, China's Khrushchev. In fact, around this issue, there have always been two fundamentally opposed lines within the party: one is the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao; the other is the bourgeois reactionary line represented by China's Khrushchev. These two lines, as the struggle developed, engaged in fierce battles around the following three issues.

At the beginning of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the focus of the struggle was: should capitalist industry and commerce be transformed? China's Khrushchev and his accomplices fiercely opposed Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's correct line of utilizing, restricting, and transforming, insisting on the reactionary policy of allowing capitalism to develop freely.

During the high tide of socialist transformation, the focus of the struggle was: is the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce genuine or fake? China's Khrushchev and his accomplices used cunning methods, attempting to "change the soup but not the medicine," allowing the capitalists to continue firmly grasping the actual leadership of the enterprises, thus "smiling and entering socialism peacefully."

After the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, the focus of the struggle was: should the bourgeoisie be completely eliminated? Should the socialist revolution be carried out to the end in politics, economics, and ideology? China's Khrushchev and his accomplices even more desperately opposed Chairman Mao's correct line, spreading the theory of "class struggle extinguished," using it as a smokescreen to launch a frenzied counterattack and revenge, attempting to turn public-private joint ventures into enterprises that are "socialist in form but capitalist in substance," aiming to achieve the evil goal of restoring capitalism.

Over the past eighteen years, the history of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in our country has been a history of fierce struggle between these two lines, a history of the continuous victory and advancement of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and a history of the resistance and failure of China's Khrushchev's bourgeois reactionary line.

Should the transformation be carried out?

The founding of the People's Republic of China marked the transition of our revolution from the stage of the new democratic revolution to the stage of the socialist revolution.

Our great teacher Chairman Mao creatively applied the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism, scientifically analyzed China's specific conditions, and divided China's capitalist economy into bureaucratic capital and national capital. Bureaucratic capital is the economic foundation of reactionary rule, and we must adopt the policy of expropriation to turn it into socialist state-owned economy, becoming the leading component of the entire national economy. National capital must be implemented with the policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming, ultimately eliminating it. This is because China's national bourgeoisie has two aspects. During the bourgeois democratic revolution, it has a revolutionary aspect and a compromising aspect. During the socialist revolution, it has the possibility of being forced to accept socialist transformation, but it also has a strong reactionary desire to develop capitalism. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, for a period of time, in order to cope with the oppression of imperialism and to quickly restore and develop industrial and agricultural production, it is still necessary to utilize the initiative of urban and rural private capitalism within a certain range. However, national capital must be restricted, and socialist transformation must be gradually carried out, that is, through the form of state capitalism, turning it into socialist economy. On the eve of national victory, Chairman Mao, in his report to the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, emphasized: after solving the land problem, the basic contradiction within the country is the "contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie." He clearly proposed: "Restriction and anti-restriction will be the main form of class struggle within a new democratic state. If we think that we do not need to restrict capitalism now and that we can abandon the slogan of 'controlling capital,' this is completely wrong; this is the viewpoint of right opportunism." Subsequently, at the end of the stage of national economic recovery, Chairman Mao again proposed the general line of the party in the transitional period, that is: "Over a fairly long period of time, gradually realize the socialist industrialization of the country, and gradually realize the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce by the country."

However, China's Khrushchev openly jumped out and brazenly opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. He believed that national capital should not adopt a policy of restriction but should welcome the exploitation of capitalists and strive to create a counter-revolutionary public opinion of "capitalist exploitation is meritorious." He shouted everywhere that "socialism is still a matter of several decades later." He repeatedly declared that he would "struggle to consolidate the new democratic system." This is to develop capitalism in China, establish bourgeois dictatorship, and actually make China retreat to the miserable situation of semi-colonialism and semi-feudalism.

As early as 1949, China's Khrushchev, in his article "The Policy and Problems of Economic Construction in New China," advocated: "For private enterprises, implement 'peaceful economic competition... so-called economic competition is not mainly administrative measures,' 'under roughly the same conditions, see who operates better.'" After the liberation of Beijing and Tianjin in 1949, he further elaborated on this reactionary proposition. He said: "The scope of private enterprises is very large and can develop in parallel with state-owned enterprises." He also said, "Perhaps in the future, private production will surpass public production, but the government is not afraid. Our main goal is to develop production and do not oppose such production developing more."

The so-called "peaceful economic competition," the so-called "parallel development," the so-called "not opposing such production developing more," is this not a brazen rejection of the restriction and transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, determined to develop the capitalist economy? Is this not a brazen rejection of Chairman Mao's instructions to make the state-owned economy the leading component of the national economy? In essence, this is to negate the socialist economy, develop the capitalist economy, negate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and establish bourgeois dictatorship. The reactionary line proposed by China's Khrushchev concentrates the strong reactionary desire of the national bourgeoisie to develop capitalism. His true colors as a bourgeois agent are exposed here!

"Ants climbing the locust tree boast of their great country, cicadas shaking the tree talk of how easy it is." Despite the desperate interference and obstruction of the biggest clique of capitalist roaders in the party led by China's Khrushchev, despite the repeated resistance and sabotage of the national bourgeoisie, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in our country still surged forward in victory.

Is it genuine transformation or fake transformation?

In July 1955, Chairman Mao issued the great report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperative Transformation," which, like a strong east wind, dispersed the dark clouds of right opportunism. In the vast rural areas of our country, a magnificent wave of agricultural cooperative transformation surged forward with the momentum of ten thousand horses galloping. The socialist transformation of agriculture from mutual aid teams to primary agricultural cooperatives and then to advanced agricultural cooperatives was rapidly realized. Chairman Mao timely issued the great call: "The socialist transformation of China's handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce should also be completed earlier to meet the needs of agricultural development." The great leader's call immediately spread throughout the country. Revolutionary cadres and workers enthusiastically responded, launching a high tide of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce in the entire industry across the country.

In the face of the surging socialist transformation, China's Khrushchev saw that open obstruction was no longer possible, so he quickly changed his counter-revolutionary tactics, using the party and government power he had usurped, sometimes in the foreground and sometimes in the background, shooting poisoned arrows at the socialist transformation, setting up one trap after another, attempting to bring this world-shaking revolutionary movement onto the track of revisionism. On the one hand, he deliberately obscured the fact that this was a life-and-death class struggle, creating a counter-revolutionary public opinion of "merging into one," extolling the bourgeoisie, saying that the industry-wide public-private joint venture was "what the capitalists themselves wanted to do"; on the other hand, he desperately fought for the leadership of the bourgeoisie, plotting through the method of "changing the soup but not the medicine" to allow the capitalists to continue to grasp the leadership of the enterprises, aiming to preserve capitalism.

China's Khrushchev, as early as the founding of the country, had once said to the bourgeoisie: "You are now only running one factory, in the future, you can run two, three... eight factories; when it is time for socialism, the state will issue an order, and you will hand over the factory to the state, or the state will buy your... then, the state will still give you these eight factories to run, you are still the manager... and give you eight more factories, a total of sixteen factories to run, your salary will not be reduced, and you will be given more...", so the "bourgeoisie" can "smile and enter socialism peacefully," enjoying both fame and wealth. In 1955 and 1956, during the high tide of socialist transformation, China's Khrushchev was still singing the same tune.

Is it really like this? No!

The socialist transformation of the capitalist ownership of the means of production in our country is a serious life-and-death class struggle between the working class and the bourgeoisie. The national bourgeoisie was forced to take the road of socialist transformation: first, we had continuously fought a revolution for twenty-two years, overthrowing the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and established a state power of the dictatorship of the proletariat. "The people have a powerful state machine and are not afraid of the rebellion of the national bourgeoisie." Second, we expropriated bureaucratic capital, which accounted for eighty percent of the entire capitalist economy, and established a powerful socialist state-owned economy. Thus, the state grasped the lifeline of the national economy, making it easier to transform the remaining twenty percent of national capital through the method of peaceful purchase. Third, we gradually realized agricultural cooperation, thus cutting off the connection between the national bourgeoisie and the countryside, placing them in the midst of a powerful worker-peasant alliance that had developed from a long period of revolutionary struggle and agricultural cooperation. Fourth, we had repeatedly competed and struggled with the national bourgeoisie, such as the struggle against speculation and profiteering and the stabilization of prices in the early days of the founding of the country, the large-scale mass struggle of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, etc. Through these struggles, the proletariat won victory after victory. Fifth, we controlled raw materials, credit, and the market, making private enterprises unable to move a step without the state-owned economy, allowing us to gradually transform them through the initial form of state capitalism (processing and ordering, unified purchase and marketing, agency sales) to the advanced form of state capitalism (individual enterprise public-private joint ventures to industry-wide public-private joint ventures) through these interconnected steps, forcing them to take the road of socialist transformation. On the other hand, we adopted the policy of purchasing national capital, economically from distributing a certain amount of profits to implementing the interest payment system, and constitutionally giving them a vote and a job guarantee, making them see that accepting transformation is more beneficial than resisting transformation. At the same time, we carried out necessary political education for them and their children. It was under these important conditions and through repeated struggles that we successfully carried out the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. China's Khrushchev turned the great victory won by the proletariat through serious and complex class struggle into the result of the capitalists being "enlightened" and "progressive," aiming to continue to obtain deceptive political capital for the bourgeoisie and create public opinion for the bourgeoisie to restore capitalism through the method of "peaceful evolution."

We turned private capitalist enterprises into public-private joint ventures, essentially eliminating the capitalist ownership of the means of production, allowing the proletariat to grasp the leadership of the enterprises, not allowing the bourgeoisie and the proletariat to compete on an equal footing in the enterprises, and certainly not allowing the bourgeoisie to continue to grasp the leadership of the enterprises.

However, China's Khrushchev used every means to allow the bourgeoisie to continue to grasp the leadership of the enterprises, implementing "public-private joint ventures" and "turning public into private." To achieve this evil goal, he maliciously slandered the communists and revolutionary cadres working in the enterprises, while extolling and praising the bourgeois elements. On the one hand, he gnashed his teeth and cursed the communists and revolutionary cadres, saying, "Once you become a communist, you become very stupid," "eating public food makes you not as smart as a merchant," on the other hand, he said, "The capitalists' property has all been handed over, and they are no longer capitalists... don't think that those who are promoted will definitely be worse than you." He shouted that the commercial departments should treat the capitalists and their agents as "gentlemen," "wealth," and "treasures" and give them important positions. If they could not hold real positions, they should be invited to "be consultants, be advisors, be teachers." If anyone did not listen to him, he would label them with the hats of "conservatism" and "sectarianism."

China's Khrushchev, in order to allow the bourgeoisie to grasp the leadership of public-private joint ventures, in order to turn public-private joint ventures into enterprises that are "socialist in form but capitalist in substance," also maliciously slandered the management system and style of socialist enterprises, extolling the management system and style of capitalist enterprises, attempting to preserve the entire set of organizational forms and systems, methods of capitalist enterprises. On the one hand, he blabbered about how "socialist commerce exists with inflexibility and stupidity," on the other hand, he extolled the capitalist "how to make more profits, do it that way" business philosophy, even publicly proposing that "socialism should be run according to the capitalist model." People cannot help but ask: is this really about transforming capitalism into socialism, or is it about transforming socialism into capitalism? China's Khrushchev loves, thinks about, and praises capitalism, hates, fears, and curses socialism. Is this not exposed clearly?

However, the tide of history surges forward, unstoppable. As Chairman Mao said: "Opportunists who try to block the tide may be found almost everywhere, but the tide is unstoppable. Socialism is advancing to victory everywhere, leaving all obstacles behind."

Is it to carry the socialist revolution to the end, or to engage in capitalist restoration?

After the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, our great leader Chairman Mao timely issued the great call to carry the socialist revolution to the end on the political and ideological fronts. This is a great strategic measure to finally and thoroughly eliminate the bourgeoisie in China and ensure that the country will never change color, a great development of Marxism-Leninism by Chairman Mao.

The industry-wide public-private joint venture of capitalist industry and commerce marked the basic victory of the working class in the transformation of capitalist ownership. However, the bourgeoisie is not reconciled, they are still alive, and their hearts are not dead. Once they have the opportunity, they will still engage in activities to restore capitalism. Therefore, class struggle has not ended, the danger of capitalist restoration still exists, and the task of socialist transformation has not been completed. Especially on the political and ideological fronts, the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie over who will win and who will lose will take a very long time to resolve.

Chairman Mao clearly pointed out: "Some people say that the Chinese bourgeoisie now has no duality but only one aspect. Is this true? It is not true. Even if they do not receive interest and remove the capitalist hat, they still need a considerable period of time to continue ideological transformation."

Therefore, after achieving public-private joint ventures, it is still necessary to use enterprises as the base and, under the supervision of the working masses, carry out long-term and serious ideological transformation of the capitalists, continuously criticize the bourgeoisie, and finally achieve a thorough victory and elimination of the bourgeoisie on the political and ideological fronts. Completing this task is much more arduous than achieving the public-private joint venture of enterprises and will take a longer time.

However, China's Khrushchev is not dead yet. He, in order to restore capitalism, overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat, stubbornly opposed Chairman Mao's wise instructions. Soon after the industry-wide public-private joint venture, he eagerly advocated the theory of "class struggle extinguished," shouting: "Today's capitalists are new-style capitalists of public-private joint ventures," "they are politically reliable for more than ninety percent," "the main contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie has been resolved." "The public and private parties have become a purely 'cooperative relationship,' and can be resolved by compromise." He summed up his meaning in one sentence: "The Chinese bourgeoisie will still be fragrant for a period of time."

To make the bourgeoisie "fragrant," the proletariat "stink"; capitalism "fragrant," socialism "stink" - this is the true intention of his spreading the theory of "class struggle extinguished."

After the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the capitalist ownership of the means of production, in 1957, the bourgeois rightists launched a frenzied attack; in 1959, they launched another frenzied attack through their agents within the party; during the period of temporary difficulties in the national economy, they launched an even more frenzied attack. China's Khrushchev himself was the mastermind behind the bourgeoisie's repeated frenzied attacks. These ironclad facts are not clear evidence that the theory of "class struggle extinguished" is nothing but a smokescreen for the enemy's attack?

In November 1959, China's Khrushchev openly said in a letter to a responsible person of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce that the bourgeois elements had "gone through several stages of understanding, finally reaching the stage of conviction and satisfaction" towards the Communist Party and socialism. Subsequently, in February 1960, he further explained: "Satisfaction includes the issue of emotions and worldview. Once the worldview changes, emotions also change, and one will be happy about the progress of the country."

What a "conviction" and "satisfaction"! What a change in "worldview"! According to him, the Chinese national bourgeoisie not only has no duality and does not need to be transformed anymore, but can also "peacefully enter socialism" and even "peacefully enter the Communist Party"! No wonder China's Khrushchev openly wanted to bring some capitalists into the Communist Party.

China's Khrushchev, in order to deceive people, also hypocritically said some words about continuing to "transform" the bourgeoisie. However, what did he say? See the wonderful theory he spoke to the standing committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce in 1960: "We can divide the work like this: you take one end, making all industrial and commercial people walk the socialist road, follow the Communist Party, progress in thought, transform the worldview, and do things for the country, this end you take. We take care of the industrial and commercial people, we take. If one end is not done well, we can give each other suggestions. Let's have a verbal agreement." Wonderful! The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce is in charge of transformation, the Communist Party is in charge of care. What is this about who transforms whom? According to this absurd "division of labor theory," does the party not have the right to transform the capitalists but only the obligation to take care of them? China's Khrushchev wants the capitalists to grasp the leadership of the enterprises and does not allow the party to carry out ideological transformation of the capitalists. Is this not to restore capitalism in China?

China's Khrushchev not only wants to protect the old bourgeoisie but also wants to cultivate the new bourgeoisie. In 1961 and 1962, in response to the frenzied attacks of domestic and foreign class enemies, he eagerly advocated the expansion of free markets, advocating that "it can be considered to allow a batch of merchants to come out, open a batch, legalize them," "some underground factories are also good," "do not be afraid of the spread of capitalism," even openly shouting "produce a new bourgeoisie." How arrogant! Not only that, he also attempted to "peacefully transform" socialist state-owned enterprises into capitalist enterprises. For this, he frantically opposed the "Anshan Constitution" personally summarized by our great leader Chairman Mao, wanting to implement a counter-revolutionary revisionist line in socialist state-owned enterprises, plotting to cultivate a new bourgeoisie in state-owned enterprises. Apart from showing that he is an incurable, the biggest bourgeois agent within the party, what else can it show?

Just when China's Khrushchev's evil deeds of usurping the party and the country, restoring capitalism, reached an unprecedentedly arrogant level, the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party was successfully convened. At the meeting, our great leader Chairman Mao issued the great call of "never forget class struggle." A spring thunder swept away China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary fallacy of "class struggle extinguished," shattering his evil plot to restore capitalism. After sufficient preparation, our great leader Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The great festival of the working class has arrived! The death knell of China's Khrushchev has rung! The true face of this old counter-revolutionary, who has been scheming to restore capitalism for decades, has finally been exposed to the world. In the end, this clown who attempted to reverse the wheel of history not only failed to make the bourgeoisie "fragrant" but also turned himself into a pile of filth despised by humanity.

    对资本主义工商业改造的两条路线斗争
    国务院财贸办公室革命造反联合委员会
    我国无产阶级夺取全国政权以后，怎样对待民族资本主义工商业，是一个十分重要而又复杂的问题。我们伟大领袖毛主席天才地解决了这个问题，创造了对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造的具有世界意义的成功经验，大大丰富和发展了马克思列宁主义。
      我国对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，是一场尖锐复杂的阶级斗争。这一场革命，不仅遭到资本家的种种反抗，而且遭到资产阶级在党内的总代表中国赫鲁晓夫的拚死反对。事实上，围绕着这个问题，党内一直存在着两条根本对立的路线：一条路线，是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线；另一条路线，是以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的资产阶级反动路线。这两条路线，随着斗争的发展，围绕下面三个问题，进行着激烈的搏斗。
      中华人民共和国成立之初，斗争的焦点是：要不要对资本主义工商业进行改造？中国赫鲁晓夫及其同伙，猖狂反对毛主席和党中央提出的利用、限制、改造的正确路线，坚持放任资本主义发展的反动政策。
    在社会主义改造高潮时期，斗争的焦点是：对资本主义工商业是真改造还是假改造？中国赫鲁晓夫及其同伙使用阴险的手法，妄图“换汤不换药”，使资本家仍然牢牢掌握企业的实际领导权，从而“眉笑眼开”地“和平进入社会主义”。
    在生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本完成以后，斗争的焦点是：要不要彻底消灭资产阶级？要不要在政治上、经济上、思想上把社会主义革命进行到底？中国赫鲁晓夫及其同伙更是拚死反对毛主席的正确路线，大肆散布“阶级斗争熄灭”论，阴谋以此为烟幕，进行疯狂的反攻倒算，妄图把公私合营企业办成“形社实资”的企业，以达到复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。
      十八年来，我国对资本主义工商业改造的历史，正是这样两条路线激烈斗争的历史，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线节节胜利、不断前进的历史，是中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线节节抵抗而又遭到失败的历史。
          要不要进行改造？
    中华人民共和国的成立，标志着我国革命由新民主主义革命阶段转变到社会主义革命阶段。
    伟大导师毛主席创造性地运用马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，科学地分析了中国的具体情况，把我国的资本主义经济区分为官僚资本和民族资本。官僚资本是反动统治的经济基础，对于它，我们必须采取没收的办法，把它变为社会主义的国营经济，成为整个国民经济的领导成分。对于民族资本必须实行利用、限制、改造的政策，最后把它消灭。这是因为我国的民族资产阶级有两面性。在资产阶级民主革命时期，它有革命性的一面，又有妥协性的一面。在社会主义革命时期，它有被迫接受社会主义改造的可能性，又有强烈要求发展资本主义的反动性。在中华人民共和国建立以后的一个时期内，为了对付帝国主义的压迫，为了迅速恢复和发展工农业生产，还需要在一定范围内利用城乡私人资本主义的积极性。但是，必须对民族资本加以限制，并且逐步地实行社会主义改造，即通过国家资本主义的形式，变为社会主义经济。在全国胜利前夕，毛主席《在中国共产党第七届中央委员会第二次全体会议上的报告》中，着重指出：在解决了土地问题以后，国内基本矛盾是“工人阶级和资产阶级的矛盾”。并且明确提出：“限制和反限制，将是新民主主义国家内部阶级斗争的主要形式。如果认为我们现在不要限制资本主义，认为可以抛弃‘节制资本’的口号，这是完全错误的，这就是右倾机会主义的观点。”随后，在国民经济恢复阶段终结的时候，毛主席又提出了党在过渡时期的总路线，即：“在一个相当长的时期内，逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，并逐步实现国家对农业、对手工业和对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。”
    但是，中国赫鲁晓夫却公然跳出来，明目张胆地对抗毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他认为对于民族资本不应采取限制政策，而应欢迎资本家剥削，并竭力制造资本主义“剥削有功”的反革命舆论。他到处叫嚷什么“搞社会主义，还是几十年以后的事情。”一再宣称要“为巩固新民主主义制度而斗争”。这就是要在中国发展资本主义，建立资产阶级专政，实际是使中国退到半殖民地、半封建的悲惨境地。
    早在一九四九年，中国赫鲁晓夫在《新中国经济建设的方针与问题》一文中就鼓吹：对私营企业实行“和平的经济竞争，……所谓经济竞争，即是不以行政手段为主”，“是在大体上相同的条件之下，看谁经
  营的好”。一九四九年北京、天津解放以后，他又进一
  步发挥了这个反动主张。他说：“私营企业的活动范围很大，可以和国营企业平行发展。”还说什么“也许将来私营生产会超过公营的，但政府并不怕，我们的主
  要目的是在发展生产，并不反对那样生产发展得多”。
      所谓“和平的经济竞争”，所谓“平行发展”，所谓
  “并不反对那样生产发展得多”，这不是明目张胆地抗
  拒对资本主义工商业的限制和改造，一心要发展资本
  主义经济吗？这不是明目张胆地抗拒毛主席关于使国
  营经济成为国民经济领导成分的指示吗？说穿了，这实际上就是要否定社会主义经济，发展资本主义经济，否定无产阶级专政，建立资产阶级专政。中国赫鲁晓夫提出的这条反动路线，集中体现了民族资产阶级强烈要求发展资本主义的反动性。他的资产阶级代理人的真面目，在这里暴露得多么清楚啊！
      “蚂蚁缘槐夸大国，蚍蜉撼树谈何易。”尽管有以
  中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资派的拚命干扰和阻挠，尽管遭到民族资产阶级的反复的反抗和破坏，但在毛主席无产阶级革命路线指引下，我国对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造运动，依然一浪高一浪地向前胜利发展。
        是真改造，还是假改造？
    一九五五年七月，毛主席发表了具有伟大历史意义的《关于农业合作化问题》的报告。它象一阵强劲的东风驱散了右倾机会主义的乌云。在我国广大农村，一个波澜壮阔的农业合作化运动高潮，以万马奔腾之势，汹涌澎湃地开展起来了。从互助组到初级农业合作社再到高级农业合作社的农业社会主义改造迅速地实现了。毛主席又适时地发出了伟大号召：“中国的手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，也应当争取提早一些时候去完成，才能适应农业发展的需要。”伟大领袖毛主席的号召立刻传遍了全国。广大革命职工积极响应，在全国范围内掀起了资本主义工商业全行业公私合营的社会主义改造高潮。
    在滚滚向前的社会主义改造高潮面前，中国赫鲁晓夫眼看公开阻挡是不行了，于是又赶忙变换反革命手法，利用他窃取的党政大权，有时在台前，有时在幕后，向社会主义改造发射一支又一支的毒箭，设置了一个又一个的暗礁，妄图把这场震动世界的革命运动纳入修正主义的轨道。他一面故意抹煞这是一场你死我活的阶级斗争，大造“合二而一”的反革命舆论，极力美化资产阶级，说什么全行业公私合营“是资本家自己要这样作的”；一面又拚命为资产阶级争夺领导权，阴谋通过“换汤不换药”的办法，使资本家继续掌握企业的领导大权，以达到保存资本主义的目的。
    中国赫鲁晓夫早在建国之初，就曾经说过这样向资产阶级“交底”的话：“你现在才只办一个厂子，将来你可以办两个、三个……办八个厂子；到社会主义的时候，国家下个命令，你就把工厂交给国家，或者由国家收买你的，……然后，国家把这八个工厂还是交给你办，你还是经理，……再加给你八个厂子，一共十六个厂子交给你办，薪水不减你的，还要给你增加……”，这样，“资产阶级”就可以“眉笑眼开”地“和平进入社会主义”，名利双收。在一九五五年和一九五六年社会主义改造高潮时期，中国赫鲁晓夫唱的仍然是这个调子。
    事实果真是这样的吗？否！
    我国对生产资料的资本主义所有制的社会主义改造，是一场工人阶级同资产阶级的严重的你死我活的阶级斗争。民族资产阶级所以走上社会主义改造的道路，是逼出来的：第一，我们连续进行了二十二年的革命战争，推翻了国民党反动派的统治，建立了无产阶级专政的国家政权。“人民手里有强大的国家机器，不怕民族资产阶级造反。”第二，我们没收了占整个资本主义经济百分之八十的官僚资本，建立了强大的社会主义国营经济。这样，国家就掌握了国民经济的命脉，就更便于对其余占百分之二十的民族资本采取和平赎买的办法加以改造。第三，我们逐步实现了农业合作化，从而切断了民族资产阶级同农村的联系，使他们处于从长期革命斗争和农业合作化的基础上发展起来的强大的工农联盟的夹击之中。第四，我们同民族资产阶级进行了反复的较量和斗争，例如建国初期打击投机倒把、稳定物价的斗争，大规模的群众性的“三反”、“五反”斗争等等，通过这些斗争，无产阶级取得了一次又一次的胜利。第五，我们控制了原料、信贷和市场，使私营企业从生产到销售离开国营经济就寸步难行，这使我们有可能经过初级形式的国家资本主义（加工订货、统购包销、经销代销），到高级形式的国家资本主义（个别企业的公私合营到全行业公私合营）这样互相衔接的步骤，一步一步地逼他们不
  能不走上社会主义改造的道路。另一方面，我们对民
  族资产阶级采取了赎买的政策，经济上从分配一定的
  利润到实行定息制度，宪法上又给了他们一张选票、
  一个饭碗的保证，使他们看到接受改造比抗拒改造较
  为有利。同时，对他们本人及其子女进行了必要的政
  治教育工作。正是在这样一系列重要条件下，经过反
  复的斗争，才使我们胜利地开展了对资本主义工商业
  的社会主义改造。中国赫鲁晓夫把工人阶级经过严重
  的复杂的阶级斗争所夺取的这一伟大胜利，说成是资
  本家“开明”、“进步”的结果，其目的就在于继续为
  资产阶级捞取骗人的政治资本，为资产阶级用“和平
  演变”的方式复辟资本主义制造舆论。
      我们把私人资本主义企业变为公私合营企业，实
  质上就是基本上消灭资本主义的生产资料所有制，由
  无产阶级掌握企业的领导权，决不是让资产阶级和无
  产阶级在企业中分庭抗礼、平分秋色，更不允许由资
  产阶级继续掌握企业的领导权。
      但是，中国赫鲁晓夫却千方百计地要让资产阶
  级继续掌握企业的领导大权，实行“合公营私”“化公
  为私”。为了达到这一罪恶目的，他大肆丑化在企业中
  工作的共产党员和革命干部，同时美化和吹捧资产阶
  级分子。他一面咬牙切齿地咒骂共产党员和革命干部说：“当了共产党员，就蠢得很”，“吃了公家饭就没有商人聪明”，一面又说：“资本家的财产都交了，已不是
  资本家了，……不要以为那些人提拔起来一定比你们
  差”。他叫嚷要工商部门把资本家和资本家代理人当作
  “先生”、“财富”、“宝贝”加以重用，不能担任实职工作的，又要请他们“作顾问，作参议，当先生”。如果谁不听他这一套，他就给谁戴上“保守主义”、“宗派主义”的帽子。
      中国赫鲁晓夫为了让资产阶级掌握公私合营企业的领导大权，为了把公私合营企业变成“形社实资”的企业，还竭力丑化社会主义企业的经营制度和作风，吹捧资本主义企业的经营制度和作风，力图把资本主义企业的一整套组织形式和制度、方法统统保留下来。他一方面胡说什么：“社会主义商业存在着不灵活性、愚蠢性”，一方面宣扬资本主义“怎么利润多，就怎么办”的生意经，甚至公开提出“社会主义要照资本主义的样子办”。人们不禁要问：这到底是对资本主义进行社会主义改造，还是要对社会主义进行资本主义改造？中国赫鲁晓夫爱的、想的、颂的是资本主义，恨的、怕的、骂的是社会主义，难道还不暴露得淋漓尽致了吗？
    然而，历史的潮流奔腾向前，势不可挡。正如毛主席所说：“想要阻挡潮流的机会主义者虽然几乎到处都有，潮流总是阻挡不住的，社会主义到处都在胜利地前进，把一切绊脚石抛在自己的后头。”
      是把社会主义革命进行到底，
        还是大搞资本主义复辟？
    在生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本完成以后，我们伟大领袖毛主席及时地发出了在政治战线和思想战线上把社会主义革命进行到底的伟大号召。这是在中国最后地、彻底地消灭资产阶级，保证国家永不变色的伟大战略措施，是毛主席对于马克思列宁主义的一个重大发展。
    资本主义工商业全行业公私合营，标志着工人阶级在对资本家所有制改造方面取得了基本胜利。但是，资产阶级是决不甘心的，他们人还在，心不死，一有机会，还要进行资本主义复辟活动。因此，阶级斗争并没有结束，资本主义复辟的危险依然存在，社会主义改造的任务并没有完成。特别是在政治战线和思想战线方面，无产阶级和资产阶级谁胜谁负的斗争，还需要一个很长的时期才能解决。
    毛主席明确地指出：“有人说，中国资产阶级现在已经没有两面性了，只有一面性。这是不是事实呢？不是事实。”“就是不拿定息，摘掉了资产阶级的帽子，也还需要一个相当的时间继续进行思想改造。”
    因此，在实现公私合营以后，还必须以企业为基地，在工人群众的监督下，对资本家个人进行长期的认真的思想改造，不断批判资产阶级，最后在政治战线、思想战线彻底战胜和消灭资产阶级。完成这个任务，比实现企业的公私合营，要艰巨得多，需要更长的时间。
    但是，中国赫鲁晓夫贼心不死，他为了复辟资本主义，颠覆无产阶级专政，顽固地对抗毛主席的英明指示，在全行业公私合营后不久，他就竭力宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭”论，叫嚷：“今天的资本家已是公私合营了的新式资本家了”，“他们百分之九十几政治上是可靠的”，“无产阶级与资产阶级的主要矛盾也解决了。”“公方和私方已经变成单纯的‘共事关系’了，可以用妥
  协的办法来解决”等等。他画龙点睛地把他的意思概
  括为一句话：“中国资产阶级还要香一个时期。”
      要资产阶级“香”，无产阶级“臭”；资本主义“香”，
  社会主义“臭”——这就是他大肆散布“阶级斗争熄
  灭”论的真正用意。
      在资本主义生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本
  完成以后，一九五七年资产阶级右派发动了猖狂进攻；
  一九五九年又通过他们在党内的代理人发动了猖狂进
  攻；在国民经济暂时困难时期再次发动了更猖狂的进
  攻。而中国赫鲁晓夫本人正是资产阶级屡次猖狂进攻
  的总后台。这样一些铁的事实，不是清楚地说明“阶级
  斗争熄灭”论，不过是敌人掩护进攻的一个烟幕吗？
      一九五九年十一月，中国赫鲁晓夫在给工商联一
  个负责人的信中公然说什么，资产阶级分子对共产党
  和社会主义“经过了几个认识阶段，最后达到信服、悦
  服的阶段。”随后，在一九六○年二月，他又进一步解释说：“悦服也者，包括感情和世界观的问题。世界观一改变，感情也就变了，对国家的进步就会感到高兴。”
      好一个“信服、悦服”！好一个“世界观”的改
  变！照他这么说，中国民族资产阶级不仅没有两面性，不需要再改造了，不仅可以“和平长入社会主义”了，而且简直可以“和平长入共产党”了！怪不得中国赫鲁晓夫公然要把一些资本家拉入共产党内来了。
    中国赫鲁晓夫为了掩人耳目，也假惺惺地说过一些对资产阶级继续“改造”的话。但是，他是怎样说的呢？请看一九六○年他对民建会、工商联常务委员讲的这段妙论：“我们可以这样来分工：你们包一头，叫所有工商业者走社会主义道路，跟共产党走，思想进步，改造世界观，为国家做事，这一头你们包了。对工商业者照顾，我们包了。那一头做得不够，可以互相提意见。我们来一个口头协定。”妙得很！工商联管改造，共产党管照顾。这到底是要谁改造谁？按照这种荒谬绝伦的“分工论”，党对资本家岂不只有照顾的义务，而没有改造的权力吗？中国赫鲁晓夫又要资本家掌握企业领导权，又不准党对资本家进行思想改造，这不是要在中国复辟资本主义又是什么？
    中国赫鲁晓夫不仅要保护旧的资产阶级，而且要培植新生的资产阶级。一九六一年和一九六二年，同国内外阶级敌人猖狂进攻相呼应，他竭力鼓吹扩大自由市场，宣扬“可以考虑允许一批商人出来，开放一批，给他合法化”，“有的开地下工厂也好”，“不要怕资本主义泛滥”，甚至公然叫嚷“再产生一个新的资产阶级”。这是何等狂妄！不仅如此，他还妄图把社会主义国营企业也“和平演变”成资本主义企业。为此，他疯狂地同我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自总结的“鞍钢宪法”大唱反调，要在社会主义国营企业中推行一套反革命修正主义路线，阴谋在国营企业中也培植起新生的资产阶级。这除了说明他是一个不可救药的党内最大的资产阶级代理人以外，还能说明什么呢？
    就在中国赫鲁晓夫进行篡党、篡国，复辟资本主义的罪恶勾当达到空前猖狂程度的关键时刻，党的八届十中全会胜利召开了，会上我们伟大领袖毛主席发出了“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大号召。一声春雷，横扫了中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”的反革命谬论，粉碎了他妄图复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋。在经过充分的准备以后，伟大领袖毛主席又亲自发动和领导了史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命。工人阶级的盛大的节日来到了！中国赫鲁晓夫的丧钟敲响了！这个几十年来一心要搞资本主义的老反革命的真面目终于暴露在光天化日之下。到头来，这个妄图扭转历史车轮的小丑，不但没有把资产阶级搞“香”，反而连他自己也成了不齿于人类的臭狗屎堆。
