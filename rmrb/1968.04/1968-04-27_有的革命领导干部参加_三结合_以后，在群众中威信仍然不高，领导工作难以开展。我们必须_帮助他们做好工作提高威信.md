Some revolutionary cadres, after participating in the "three-in-one combination," still have low prestige among the masses, making it difficult for them to carry out their leadership work. We must help them do a good job and raise their prestige.

Sun Liyou, the former director of the Industrial and Transportation Office of the original county people's committee, made relatively serious mistakes during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Through the criticism and help of the revolutionary masses, he recognized and examined his mistakes. Therefore, he stood up and was elected as a member of the revolutionary committee. However, in the initial period, his prestige among the masses was still not high. The masses did not want to listen to him, and his work was difficult to carry out.

Later, we studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the revolutionary committees and his teachings such as "Our responsibility is to serve the people." We realized that after helping revolutionary cadres to stand up, whether we continue to help them do a good job in leadership is a test of whether we are completely and thoroughly serving the people.

Therefore, on the one hand, we educated the masses to view cadres with a developmental perspective and to support revolutionary cadres. On the other hand, we actively supported Sun Liyou in his work, encouraging him to work boldly. Whenever he made progress and achieved results in his work, we gave him support and encouragement. We made him understand that prestige is established by being loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Once, a part of the masses, influenced by the economic wind, demanded that Sun Liyou sign off on a large amount of unreasonable expenses. Although the pressure was great, he insisted on principles and firmly refused to sign. We, on the one hand, used Mao Zedong Thought to educate this part of the masses, and on the other hand, firmly supported him. In the end, the masses became aware and no longer demanded that he sign. Through this incident, the broad masses changed their views on Sun Liyou. Sun Liyou's prestige among the masses greatly improved, and his work was carried out more smoothly.

    有的革命领导干部参加“三结合”以后，在群众中威信仍然不高，领导工作难以开展。我们必须——
    帮助他们做好工作提高威信

    原县人委工交办公室主任孙立友，在无产阶级文化大革命中犯了比较严重的错误。经过革命群众的批判帮助，他认识和检查了错误，因此他站了出来，并被选为革命委员会的委员。可是，开初一段时间，他在群众中威信仍然不高，说话群众不愿意听，工作很难开展。
    后来，我们学习了毛主席关于革命委员会的最新指示和“我们的责任，是向人民负责”等教导，认识到，帮助革命干部站出来以后，是否继续帮助他们做好领导工作，是考验我们是否完全、彻底为人民服务的一个标志。
    于是，我们一方面教育群众，要用发展的眼光看待干部，要支持革命的领导干部；一方面积极在工作中为孙立友撑腰，启发他大胆工作。他在工作中有进步有成绩，就给他支持和鼓励。使他认识到，威信是从忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线而树立起来的。有一次，一部分群众由于受了经济主义妖风的影响，要求孙立友签字开支一大批不合理的经费，虽然压力很大，但他坚持原则，坚决拒绝签字。我们就一方面用毛泽东思想教育这部分群众，一方面坚决给他撑腰。最后，群众觉悟起来，就不要求他签字了。通过这件事，广大群众改变了对孙立友的看法。孙立友在群众中的威信大有提高，工作开展也较顺利了。
