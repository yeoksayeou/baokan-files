Don't Let the Chinese Khrushchev Turn Things Upside Down!

	Pinggu County, Han Zhuang People's Commune, Hu Zhuang Production Brigade

	During the three years of temporary difficulties, the Chinese Khrushchev brazenly came out and said, "It's not scary if some bourgeois elements emerge in society, don't be afraid of the spread of capitalism." His trick was to try to use this smokescreen to blind our poor and lower-middle peasants, making us unable to see the danger of restoring capitalism, so that he could freely cultivate a handful of capitalist roaders within the party and new bourgeois elements, collude with landlords, rich peasants, counterrevolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and attempt to restore capitalism. This trick of his is indeed very vicious!

	Just during the three years of temporary difficulties, the black wind of restoring capitalism that the Chinese Khrushchev stirred up also blew to our brigade. The local capitalist roaders chopped up our brigade's collective pig farm in one stroke. They also launched a two-pronged attack on collective agricultural production: on one hand, they incited some members to cultivate the edges of the fields, encroaching on collective farmland; on the other hand, they implemented piecework to households for field management, practicing disguised individual farming. At the same time, they were kind to class enemies and harsh to poor and lower-middle peasants. They wanted the brigade to support a few landlord and rich peasant households as "five guarantees" households, and when a rich peasant woman died, they had the brigade buy a coffin to bury her. This new bourgeois element, relying on the power he had usurped, was developing capitalism and practicing bourgeois dictatorship over the poor and lower-middle peasants.

	However, a rabbit's tail can't grow long. In the great Four Clean-ups movement, we poor and lower-middle peasants, with Chairman Mao's support, dragged out the brigade's capitalist roaders, seized back the reins of power. In this great proletarian cultural revolution led by Chairman Mao in person, we again dragged out the Chinese Khrushchev and beat him to the ground. This shows: whoever dares to "turn things upside down" and oppress us poor and lower-middle peasants again will definitely not end up well!

    不准中国赫鲁晓夫翻天！
    平谷县韩庄公社胡庄大队
    中国赫鲁晓夫在三年暂时困难时期，公然跳出来胡说什么“社会上产生一些资产阶级分子并不可怕，不要怕资本主义泛滥。”他打的鬼算盘就是妄图靠这种烟幕弹蒙住我们贫下中农的眼睛，使我们看不见复辟资本主义的危险，好让他放手培植党内一小撮走资派和新生的资产阶级分子，勾结地富反坏右分子，企图复辟资本主义。他这一鬼招，真是阴毒极了！
    就在三年暂时困难时期，中国赫鲁晓夫刮的复辟资本主义的黑风，也吹到我们大队来了。当地的走资派把我们大队的集体猪场一刀砍掉。又对集体农业生产展开了两路夹攻：一面煽动部分社员大搞十边地，蚕食集体耕地；一面又对集体耕地的田间管理推行包工到户，搞变相单干。同时，他对阶级敌人亲，对贫下中农狠。要大队对几家地主、富农当作“五保户”供养起来，有一个富农婆死了，他叫大队买棺材为她发葬。这个新生的资产阶级分子，就是这样倚仗着他所篡夺到手的大权，在发展资本主义，对贫下中农实行资产阶级专政的。
    但是，兔子的尾巴长不了。在伟大的四清运动中，我们贫下中农有毛主席撑腰，把大队的走资派揪了出来，夺回了印把子。在这次毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，又揪出了中国赫鲁晓夫，把他打得人仰马翻。这说明：谁妄想“翻天”，重新欺压我们贫下中农，就决不会有好下场！
