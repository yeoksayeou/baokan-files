According to Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, April 29th: The broad masses of peasants in Nan Gundan Gou Brigade, Zhai Bei Commune, Ping Shan County, Hebei Province, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, have, in the midst of the revolutionary criticism movement, fiercely criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev, established the idea of "opening mountains and cultivating fields for the revolution," further carried forward the spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle, and launched a new high tide of opening mountains, cultivating fields, and spring production.

Nan Gundan Gou Brigade has resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's great directive of "learning agriculture from Dazhai," and formulated a seven-year plan to "learn from Dazhai and change the face of the mountainous area." This plan, in addition to requiring an increase in yield per unit area, also calls for continuing to open mountains and cultivate fields to expand the area of cultivated land. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants are highly determined to open mountains and cultivate fields. However, some comrades said, "The land we have now, after delivering the state procurement grain each year, still has surplus grain. Why do we need to exert so much effort to open mountains?"

Once this thought emerged, the PLA Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team and the leading cadre recognized that whether to cultivate for the revolution or for oneself is a struggle between two kinds of thoughts and two roads.

Thus, the propaganda team, through Mao Zedong Thought study classes, organized everyone to repeatedly study the brilliant works of "Old Three Articles" and others, taking Zhang Zide, Bai Qen, and Old Yu Gong as examples, learning and carrying forward the revolutionary spirit of completely selfless dedication. At the same time, they launched a deep criticism of the reactionary fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev, such as "suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage." Party branch secretary Li Quan Shu said: Chairman Mao teaches us to serve the people wholeheartedly, but the Chinese Khrushchev advocates the decadent bourgeois philosophy of life. The Chinese Khrushchev is trying to seduce us to only care for ourselves, forget the revolution, and take the capitalist road. We will not fall for the Chinese Khrushchev's tricks. We open mountains and cultivate fields not for the sake of personal food. Every inch of mountain we open and every bit of field we cultivate, we think of the interests of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. Now our lives have improved, but we must never forget that three-quarters of the world's class brothers and laboring people are still living under oppression and exploitation. For the sake of the socialist revolution and construction of our motherland, and to support the world revolution, we must forever struggle hard and open mountains and cultivate fields for the revolution.

On the basis of further raising class awareness, everyone put forward the grand slogan of "opening mountains and cultivating fields for the revolution for a lifetime." They said, we cultivate fields for the revolution, first of all to ensure that the iron-clad dictatorship of the proletariat in our country will never change color and that the world's people will be liberated. If we only see personal immediate interests and forget the revolution, that would be forgetting our roots, that would be the greatest disloyalty to Chairman Mao.

The revolutionary criticism promoted the revolutionization of people's thinking. A magnificent battle of opening mountains and cultivating fields began. Every day, the peasants, facing the morning sun, holding high Chairman Mao's portrait, carrying the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," spirited and full of fighting spirit, came to the construction site. The first thing they did before work was to study the quotations from Chairman Mao. During labor, they constantly checked the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest directives. On the construction site, the songs of Mao's quotations and the slogans of competition rose and fell. They shouted with their mouths, "Determine to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory," and in their hearts, they thought, "Prepare for war, prepare for famine, and serve the people." The more they worked, the more enthusiastic they became, and the more they worked, the firmer their revolutionary will became. With the spirit of moving mountains like Yu Gong, since last winter, they have expanded the area of cultivated land from the cracks in the rocks by more than ten mu.

At present, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in this brigade, with the help of the PLA Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team, are further establishing and running various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, vigorously promoting the revolution, and vigorously promoting production, determined to achieve new victories in both revolution and production.

    批判了修正主义谬论　提高了社会主义觉悟
    南滚龙沟贫下中农为革命开山修田
    据新华社石家庄二十九日电　河北省平山县寨北公社南滚龙沟大队广大社员，在人民解放军的帮助下，在革命大批判中，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义谬论，树立“为革命开山修田”的思想，进一步发扬自力更生，艰苦奋斗的革命精神，掀起了开山修田、春耕生产新高潮。
    南滚龙沟大队坚决贯彻毛主席“农业学大寨”的伟大教导，制定了“学大寨，改变山区面貌”的七年规划。这个规划除要求提高单位面积产量以外，还要继续开山修田，扩大耕地面积。对于开山修田，广大贫下中农决心很大。但也有个别的社员说，现有的地，每年除向国家交售征购粮以外，打的粮食也吃不完，为什么还要下那么大的力气去开山？这种思想一露头，解放军毛泽东思想宣传队和领导班子就认识到，为革命种田，还是为自己种田，这是两种思想、两条道路的斗争。
    于是，宣传队通过毛泽东思想学习班，组织大家反复学习“老三篇”等光辉著作，以张思德、白求恩和老愚公为榜样，学习和发扬毫不利己专门利人的革命精神，同时对中国赫鲁晓夫的“吃小亏占大便宜”等资产阶级反动谬论展开了深入的批判。党支部书记李全寿说：毛主席教导我们完全彻底为人民服务，可是中国赫鲁晓夫却鼓吹资产阶级腐朽的人生哲学。中国赫鲁晓夫这是引诱我们只顾个人，忘记革命，走上资本主义的邪道。我们绝不上中国赫鲁晓夫的当。我们开山修田决不是为了个人吃饱饭。我们每开一寸山，每修一分田，想的都是中国革命和世界革命的利益。现在我们生活好了，但时刻也不能忘记世界上还有三分之二的阶级兄弟和劳动人民过着受压迫、受剥削的生活。为了祖国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设，为了支援世界革命，我们要永远艰苦奋斗，为革命开山修田。
    在阶级觉悟进一步提高的基础上，大家提出了“为革命开一辈子山，种一辈子田”的豪迈口号。他们说，我们种田是为了革命，首先是为了保证我国无产阶级铁打江山永不变色和世界人民翻身得解放。如果只看到个人眼前利益，忘了革命，那就是忘本，就是对毛主席最大的不忠。
    革命大批判促进了人的思想革命化。一场轰轰烈烈的开山修田的战斗开始了。每天，社员们迎着朝阳，高举毛主席画像，揣着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，精神焕发，斗志昂扬来到工地。他们干活前的第一件事，就是学习毛主席语录。劳动中随时检查落实毛主席最新指示的情况。工地上，毛主席语录歌声和竞赛的口号声此起彼伏。他们嘴里喊的是“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”心里想的是“备战、备荒、为人民”，越干劲头越足，越干革命斗志越坚强。他们以愚公移山的精神，自去冬以来从石头缝里扩大了耕地面积十多亩。
    目前，这个大队的广大贫下中农，在解放军毛泽东思想宣传队帮助下，进一步大办办好各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班，狠抓革命，猛促生产，决心为夺取革命、生产双胜利大立新功。
