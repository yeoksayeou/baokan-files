All levels of revolutionary committees must grasp the main contradictions, firmly hold the direction of the struggle, and never forget to raise high the banner of revolutionary criticism. The revolutionary criticism must be carried out unremittingly.

The clique of capitalist roaders within the Party, headed by the Chinese Khrushchev, are not "dead tigers." Their poison is still corroding the bodies of some of our comrades! We must not allow these beasts to "recover from their wounds and then pounce in the morning to strangle the revolution." We must further deepen the revolutionary criticism.

Revolutionary criticism is a major offensive and counterattack against the restoration plot of the clique of capitalist roaders within the Party. It is an effective disinfectant to eliminate the enemy's poison. Only through revolutionary criticism can we expose the ugly faces of the clique of capitalist roaders within the Party, headed by the Chinese Khrushchev, and bury them completely. Only through revolutionary criticism can we eliminate the poison of counter-revolutionary revisionism and thoroughly uproot the soil in which the clique of capitalist roaders within the Party and all the ghosts and monsters rely on to restore the old order.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The rightists are our teachers from the opposite side. In this sense, poisonous weeds have their merits." "A revolutionary party and revolutionary people must repeatedly undergo education from both positive and negative aspects, through comparison and contrast, to become mature and ensure victory."

The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents are the best negative teachers. We must fully utilize the role of these negative teachers, combine with various tasks and the struggle-criticism-transformation of each unit, and carry out the revolutionary criticism deeply and persistently. Through revolutionary criticism, we will continuously raise the class struggle consciousness and the awareness of line struggle among the broad revolutionary masses, so that the broad revolutionary masses can always maintain a clear mind and the correct direction. The more we criticize revisionism, the closer we are to Chairman Mao; the deeper we criticize revisionism, the tighter we follow Chairman Mao. Only in this way can we ensure that people do not degenerate, the Party does not become revisionist, the country does not change color, and the revolutionary committees can be consolidated and developed.

Class enemies, like bats, are most afraid of sunlight and revolutionary criticism. They will inevitably play tricks and plot conspiracies, creating obstacles politically, ideologically, and organizationally to sabotage revolutionary criticism and reverse the direction of the struggle. We must remain highly vigilant.

### 把革命大批判坚持不懈地开展下去

    把革命大批判坚持不懈地开展下去
    各级革命委员会一定要抓住主要矛盾，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，时刻不忘高举革命批判大旗，把革命大批判坚持不懈地开展下去。
    以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派不是“死老虎”，他们散布的毒素，还在侵蚀着我们一些同志的肌体！我们决不能让这些野兽“赢得养好创伤的机会，然后在一个早上猛扑过来，将革命扼死”。我们必须进一步深入地开展革命的大批判。
    革命的大批判，是对党内一小撮走资派复辟阴谋的大进攻、大反击，是排除敌人毒焰的一种最有效的消毒剂。只有革命的大批判，才能把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派的丑恶面目暴露在光天化日之下，彻底把他们葬入坟墓；也只有革命的大批判，才能肃清反革命修正主义的流毒，彻底铲除党内一小撮走资派和一切牛鬼蛇神借以复辟的土壤。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“右派是从反面教导我们的人。在这点上，毒草有功劳。”“革命的政党，革命的人民，总是要反复地经受正反两个方面的教育，经过比较和对照，才能够锻炼得成熟起来，才有赢得胜利的保证。”
    中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人，是最好的反面教员。我们要充分发挥这些反面教员的作用，结合各项工作任务和本单位的斗批改，把革命的大批判深入、持久地开展下去。通过革命大批判，不断地提高广大革命群众的阶级斗争观念和路线斗争觉悟，使广大革命群众始终保持清醒的头脑和正确的方向。批修越狠，对毛主席越亲；批修越深，跟毛主席越紧。只有这样，才能保证人不变质，党不变修，国不变色，才能使革命委员会得到巩固和发展。
    阶级敌人象蝙蝠害怕阳光一样，最害怕革命大批判。他们必然要施展花招，玩弄阴谋，从政治上、思想上、组织上制造重重障碍，破坏革命大批判，扭转斗争大方向。我们必须保持高度警惕。
