The People's Liberation Army's support-leftist forces stationed at Baotou Steel Company have, in accordance with Chairman Mao's directive to "never forget class struggle," helped the newly formed revolutionary committee continuously raise their awareness of class struggle and line struggle. They have opposed rightist conservative thoughts, mobilized the masses, followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and launched proactive attacks on a handful of class enemies, transforming the revolutionary committee into a vigorous and combative command center leading the broad revolutionary masses to proactively attack class enemies.

	Standing at the forefront of class struggle to command the battle

	The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is, in essence, a political revolution under socialist conditions, where the proletariat opposes the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes. It is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the broad revolutionary masses led by it, and the Kuomintang reactionaries. It is the continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie."

	In late February of this year, the revolutionary committee of Baotou Steel was established, and the revolutionary and production situation continued to improve. Under these circumstances, some members of the revolutionary committee thought that with power in hand and the situation stabilized, they could rest on their laurels and focus on administrative tasks. Workers criticized, saying, "The revolutionary committee has become an administrative committee."

	The support-leftist forces believed that if such complacency existed within the revolutionary committee, it would not be able to effectively lead the broad revolutionary masses in the struggle against class enemies and bring this political revolution to a complete victory. Therefore, the support-leftist forces and the revolutionary committee members jointly studied Chairman Mao's directive to "never forget class struggle" and analyzed the class struggle situation using Mao Zedong Thought. They criticized the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" by Khrushchev. In one factory, after the establishment of the revolutionary committee, the situation seemed calm on the surface, but a handful of class enemies secretly devised a plan to overthrow the new revolutionary power. Some used the tactic of infiltrating and pulling out, while others created chaos among the masses and attempted to spread a rightist backlash wind. These shocking facts of class struggle made everyone deeply realize that even after the decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, vigilance against class enemies must not be relaxed. A handful of traitors, spies, and unrepentant capitalist roaders who have infiltrated the Party will not accept their demise. They will inevitably collude with the remaining Kuomintang reactionary remnants to make a desperate struggle. The closer the revolution is to complete victory, the more intense and complex the class struggle becomes. At this critical moment of life-and-death struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, every member of the revolutionary committee must not be on the battlefield of class struggle without smelling the gunpowder of class struggle. Everyone said that after the establishment of the revolutionary committee, whether to continue to firmly grasp class struggle is a top priority issue related to whether Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment can be fully implemented and whether the new revolutionary power can be consolidated. It is also the most severe test of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. The newly formed revolutionary committee must stand at the forefront of class struggle and bravely command the battle.

	After raising their awareness, the committee members of the revolutionary committee, with high morale, threw themselves into the front lines of class struggle. They carried their bedding and moved to the factory area to live with the revolutionary masses, analyzing the enemy situation and formulating battle plans, and proactively launching attacks on class enemies.

	Mobilizing the masses to proactively attack class enemies

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolutionary war is the war of the masses; only by mobilizing the masses can we wage war, and only by relying on the masses can we wage war." To achieve a complete victory in the struggle, we must mobilize the masses as broadly and deeply as possible. Everyone decided to first hold a Mao Zedong Thought study class with class struggle as the central content, organizing the masses to study Chairman Mao's statements on class and class struggle. While studying, they fought. The refractory materials factory had more than a dozen section-level cadres who, through recalling class bitterness, raised their class struggle awareness and actively joined the battle. In a few days, they posted more than ninety big-character posters exposing and criticizing.

	The masses' exposure and criticism made the class enemies extremely panicked. They spread rumors everywhere, saying things like "the revolutionary committee's direction is wrong" and so on, attempting to confuse the two different types of contradictions and slip through. At this time, the support-leftist forces and the revolutionary committee members calmly analyzed the situation. They jointly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "distinguishing between reactionaries and revolutionaries, exposing the tricks of reactionaries, alerting and paying attention within the revolutionary camp, boosting our morale and demoralizing the enemy, isolating the reactionaries, and defeating or replacing them." They also organized worker Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to go deep into the construction sites, shift teams, scattered small units, and residential quarters, extensively lecturing on Chairman Mao's great teachings on class struggle, exposing the tricks of class enemies, and mobilizing everyone to brainstorm about the enemy situation and keep their eyes open to watch the enemy, putting the class enemies' every move under the supervision of the broad masses.

	For some comrades with blurred understanding and who have taken the wrong side, everyone, through home visits and individual talks, conducted patient and detailed political and ideological work, mobilizing them to come forward and expose problems, isolating the class enemies to the greatest extent. In the sintering plant, a leader of a mass organization, under the manipulation of a capitalist roader, did some bad things, delaying the realization of the revolutionary three-in-one combination in the factory. The masses wanted to pull him out and implement dictatorship. The support-leftist personnel conducted a comprehensive analysis of this leader, believing that although he had made serious mistakes, he still belonged to internal contradictions among the people. They had four consecutive heart-to-heart talks with him, patiently helping him analyze the causes of his mistakes, and finally made him realize that he had been used by the capitalist roader. He bravely stood up and face-to-face exposed the crimes of that capitalist roader, allowing the factory to quickly establish a revolutionary committee.

	Launching a revolutionary critique to thoroughly criticize and expose class enemies

	With the masses broadly mobilized, an unprecedentedly good situation emerged. At this time, some factory revolutionary committees again appeared to not pay attention to grasping the strategy of struggle and improving the art of struggle. They dealt with class enemies by "grabbing, driving away, and ignoring," not focusing on the "critique." This way, they could not truly defeat and expose the enemies, and could not thoroughly eliminate their poison. The support-leftist forces again helped the revolutionary committee members study Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Carry the Revolution Through to the End," making everyone realize that this handful of poisonous snakes "although they have felt the threat of winter, they have not yet frozen stiff!" "We must double our vigilance and not fall for their fake surrender tricks." Only by thoroughly criticizing the class enemies politically, ideologically, and theoretically can we thoroughly defeat them, making them never able to rise again, and seize the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Therefore, they again, together with the masses, launched a magnificent revolutionary critique, combining the revolutionary critique with the class struggle of their unit, and criticizing and attacking with both pen and speech the handful of capitalist roaders led by the Chinese Khrushchev and their agents in this region and unit, as well as a handful of class enemies.

	The equipment section of the steelmaking plant had a rightist element who had slipped through the net, using counter-revolutionary two-faced tactics to infiltrate the revolutionary camp. After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, he ran up and down, using all kinds of tricks, attempting to overthrow the new revolutionary power. Female apprentice Xing Yufu consecutively wrote more than thirty big-character posters, using Mao Zedong Thought as the sharpest weapon to refute his various crimes one by one. Exposing one crime, criticizing one fallacy, eliminating one poison, making this cunning enemy thoroughly criticized and stinking to the core. Such in-depth exposure and criticism hit the target, hit hard, and hit steadily, making the deceived masses wake up one by one and draw a clear line with him. Everyone then pressed on with the victory, digging out his backer as well.

	With the extensive and in-depth development of the revolutionary critique, the broad revolutionary workers further strengthened their class struggle awareness, making the movement continue to advance. This class struggle greatly promoted the thought revolutionization of people. All factories, mines, and schools under Baotou Steel have fully realized the revolutionary three-in-one combination, powerfully promoting the revolution and production. Problems that had long been unsolvable were now smoothly resolved in a short period. The revolutionary committee fully played its role as a combat command center.

    克服右倾思想　向阶级敌人继续发动进攻
    放手发动群众　彻底搞好这场政治大革命
    驻包钢支左部队帮助革委会成员不断提高阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，使革命委员会成为带领广大革命群众向阶级敌人主动进攻的、朝气蓬勃的战斗指挥部
      本报讯　人民解放军驻包头钢铁公司的支左人员，遵照毛主席关于“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，帮助新生的革命委员会不断提高阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，反对右倾保守思想，深入地发动群众，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，向一小撮阶级敌人发起主动进攻，使革委会成为向阶级敌人勇敢战斗的、朝气蓬勃的革命指挥部。
      站在阶级斗争第一线指挥战斗
    伟大领袖毛主席最近深刻指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”
    今年二月下旬，包钢成立了革命委员会，革命和生产形势越来越好。在这种情况下，有些革委会成员认为，政权在手，大局已定。他们安于现状，整天忙于事务。工人们批评说：“革命委员会简直成了事务委员会了”。
    支左部队认为，革委会里面存在这种居安思稳的思想，就不能有力地领导广大革命群众向阶级敌人进行战斗，把这场政治大革命进行到底。于是支左部队和革委会成员一起，再次学习了毛主席关于“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，用毛泽东思想分析阶级斗争的形势，大批中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭”论。有一个厂在革委会成立后的一段时间内，表面上似乎风平浪静，实际上一小撮阶级敌人暗地里制定了一个阴谋颠覆新生的革命政权的“作战计划”。他们有的采取打进来，拉出去的办法；有的在群众中制造混乱，乘机刮起一股右倾翻案妖风。种种触目惊心的阶级斗争事实，使大家深刻认识到：在无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的情况下，对阶级敌人决不能放松警惕。一小撮混进党里的叛徒、特务、顽固不化的走资派，他们是不会甘心自己的灭亡的，他们必然地要同社会上残留下来的国民党反动派余孽相勾结，妄图进行垂死挣扎。革命越是接近全面胜利，阶级斗争越是尖锐复杂。每个革委会成员，在这个无产阶级和资产阶级生死搏斗的关键时刻，绝不能身在阶级斗争的战场上，闻不到阶级斗争的火药味。大家说，在革委会成立后，是不是继续狠抓阶级斗争，是关系到毛主席伟大战略部署能不能全面落实的头等重要的问题，是关系到新生的革命政权能不能巩固的头等重要的问题，也是忠不忠于伟大领袖毛主席的一个最严峻考验。新生的革命委员会必须站在阶级斗争的第一线，勇敢地指挥战斗。
    认识提高以后，革委会的委员们就以高昂的斗志，投入阶级斗争第一线。他们纷纷扛着铺盖，搬到厂区去住，和革命群众一起分析敌情，制定作战方案，主动地向阶级敌人发起了进攻战。
    放手发动群众向阶级敌人主动进攻
    毛主席教导我们：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”要取得斗争的彻底胜利，就必须最广泛最深入地发动群众。大家决定首先举办以阶级斗争为中心内容的毛泽东思想学习班，组织群众学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述，一边学习，一边战斗。耐火材料厂有十几个科级干部，通过忆阶级苦，提高了阶级斗争观念，积极投入战斗。几天内，他们就贴出了九十多份揭发、批判的大字报。
    群众的揭发批判，使阶级敌人异常恐慌。他们到处散布流言蜚语，说什么“革委会大方向错了”等等，企图混淆两类不同性质的矛盾，蒙混过关。这时，支左部队和革委会的同志，冷静地分析了形势。他们一起学习了毛主席关于“划清反动派和革命派的界限，揭露反动派的阴谋诡计，引起革命派内部的警觉和注意，长自己的志气，灭敌人的威风，才能孤立反动派，战而胜之，或取而代之”的教导，并组织工人毛泽东思想宣传队，深入到工地值勤班组、分散小单位和家属宿舍，大讲毛主席关于阶级斗争的伟大教导，揭露阶级敌人的鬼花招，发动大家开动脑筋想敌情，擦亮眼睛看敌人，使阶级敌人的一举一动都处在广大群众监督之下。
    对一些认识模糊和站错队的同志，大家通过家庭访问、个别谈心等方法，进行耐心细致的政治思想工作，发动他们站出来揭发问题，把阶级敌人最大限度地孤立起来。烧结厂有个群众组织的头头，在一个走资派的幕后操纵下，做了一些坏事，使这个厂的革命三结合迟迟不能实现，群众都想把他揪出来实行专政。支左人员对这个头头作了全面分析，认为他虽然犯了严重错误，但还是属于人民内部矛盾，就连续四次和他谈心，耐心帮助他分析犯错误的原因，终于使他认识到自己是受了走资派的利用，大胆站出来面对面地揭发了那个走资派的罪行，使这个厂很快建立了革命委员会。
    开展革命大批判把阶级敌人批倒批臭
    群众广泛发动起来，出现了空前未有的大好形势。这时，有的厂矿革委会又出现了不注意掌握斗争策略和提高斗争艺术的情况。他们对阶级敌人“一揪、二轰、三不管”，不在“批”字上狠下功夫。这样就不能真正把敌人斗倒、斗臭，就不能彻底肃清他们的流毒。支左部队就再一次帮助革委会同志学习了毛主席的光辉著作《将革命进行到底》，使大家认识到，这一小撮毒蛇“虽然它们已经感觉到冬天的威胁，但是还没有冻僵呢！”“我们必须加倍提高警惕，决不可中了他们假投降的诡计。”只有把阶级敌人从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批深批透，才能彻底把他打倒，叫他永世不得翻身，才能夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。于是，他们又和群众一起，开展了轰轰烈烈的革命大批判，把革命大批判和本单位的阶级斗争结合起来，对以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资派及其在本地区、本单位的代理人和一小撮阶级敌人，口诛笔伐，猛烈开火。
    炼钢厂设备科有一个漏网右派分子，以反革命两面派的手法，钻进了革命派的队伍。革委会成立后，他上窜下跳，使尽阴谋诡计，妄图颠覆新生的革命政权。女徒工邢玉馥接连写了三十几张大字报，用毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器，对他的种种罪行一一加以批驳。揭露一条罪状，批判一个谬论，肃清一股流毒，把这个狡猾的敌人批得体无完肤，臭不可闻。这样深入的揭发批判，打得准，打得狠，打得稳，使受蒙蔽的群众纷纷觉醒过来，同他划清了界限。大家又乘胜追击，把他的后台老板也挖了出来。
    随着革命大批判的广泛深入开展，广大革命职工进一步增强了阶级斗争观念，使运动不断向前发展。这场阶级斗争，大大促进了人的思想革命化。包钢所属各厂矿、学校已经全部实现了革命三结合，有力地推动了革命和生产。过去长期不能解决的问题，现在在短短的时间内顺利得到了解决。革委会充分发挥了革命指挥部的战斗作用。
