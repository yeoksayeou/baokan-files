Chairman Mao's brilliant directive is the great program for the construction of revolutionary committees, the fundamental direction; it is the beacon and fundamental guarantee for achieving a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; it is the great contribution and brilliant development made by the great leader Chairman Mao to the Marxist-Leninist theory on the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The issuance of Chairman Mao's latest directive is the greatest support for the newly established revolutionary committees, and a severe blow to the handful of diehard capitalist-roaders within the Party and all class enemies. The class enemies hate the new red political power to death and fear it greatly. They use various tricks and schemes, attempting to overthrow the revolutionary committees. A few flies buzzing around, they say things like "the revolutionary committee is a product of compromise," and even scream "whoever holds power, we will seize power from them." The class enemies always want to destroy the revolutionary committees. A thunderous spring storm shakes the earth, Chairman Mao's latest directive is issued, greatly boosting the morale of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, and greatly dampening the arrogance of all class enemies. The buzzing flies have once again hit a wall, let them cry!

	“Where Chairman Mao loves, I love; where Chairman Mao supports, I support; where Chairman Mao directs, I follow; where Chairman Mao waves his hand, I advance.” Under the sun of Mao Zedong Thought, the newly established revolutionary committees have shown their great vitality. All revolutionary masses must defend, help, and support this new revolutionary power, making it more solid and perfect. New things inevitably have this or that flaw and imperfection. We must give them good-willed help and must always be on high alert, ready at any time to smash the evil plots of class enemies who attempt to overthrow the new red political power, so that the revolutionary committees can better lead the masses forward.

    对新生的革委会要坚决维护它
    毛主席的光辉指示，是革命委员会建设的伟大纲领，根本方向；是夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的指路明灯和根本保证；是伟大领袖毛主席对马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级专政学说的光辉发展和伟大贡献。
    毛主席最新指示的发表，是对革命委员会这一新生事物最大的支持，是对党内一小撮顽固不化的走资派和一切阶级敌人的狠狠的打击。阶级敌人对新生的红色政权恨得要死，怕得要命。他们施展各种阴谋诡计，妄图颠覆革命委员会。几只苍蝇嗡嗡叫，他们胡说什么“革委会是和稀泥的产物”，甚至狂叫“谁掌权就向谁夺权”。阶级敌人随时都妄想搞垮革命委员会。一声春雷震大地，毛主席最新指示发表了，大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭了一切阶级敌人的威风，嗡嗡叫的苍蝇又一次碰壁了，让它们抽泣去吧！
      “毛主席热爱我热爱，毛主席支持我支持，毛主席指示我照办，毛主席挥手我前进。”革命委员会这一新生事物，在毛泽东思想阳光照耀下，显示出了它的伟大的生命力。对新生的革命政权，一切革命群众要维护、帮助和支持它，使它更加巩固和完善。新生事物免不了有这样那样的缺点和不完善的地方，我们要善意地给予帮助，千万要提高革命警惕，随时准备粉碎阶级敌人妄图颠覆新生红色政权的罪恶阴谋，使革命委员会能更好地带领群众前进。
