We wholeheartedly endorse and will resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions on revolutionary committees! As soon as Chairman Mao's latest instructions reached our county, the standing committee members of the county revolutionary committee immediately convened a meeting to study and discuss them, and held an all-night telephone conference to convey them to the entire county. A wave of earnest study, enthusiastic propaganda, and resolute implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions quickly swept across the entire county.

Based on our personal experience, revolutionary committees are excellent!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must rely on the masses, rely on the People's Liberation Army, and rely on the majority of cadres." The revolutionary committees that combine these three elements into one organization demonstrate tremendous vitality and immense superiority. The representatives of revolutionary workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, and Red Guards who have emerged from the stormy Cultural Revolution, participate in the revolutionary committees, providing a solid mass foundation for the proletarian dictatorship. This enables the revolutionary committees to, to the greatest extent possible, represent the will of the revolutionary masses and safeguard the interests of the revolutionary masses. The representatives of the revolutionary masses continuously reflect the opinions and demands of the broad masses to the revolutionary committees, enabling the revolutionary committees to advance step by step along the mass line and do everything in the hearts of the revolutionary masses. The People's Liberation Army is the most loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, the most ardent lover of the great Mao Zedong Thought, and the most diligent in following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments. The participation of PLA representatives in the revolutionary committees not only strengthens the proletarian dictatorship but also brings the fine traditions and fine style of the PLA into the revolutionary committees, promoting the revolutionization of the leading cadre corps. It is under the guidance of PLA comrades that our county revolutionary committee has insisted on emphasizing proletarian politics and focusing on political and ideological work. Revolutionary old cadres have rich experience in struggle and strong organizational capabilities. Their participation in the new power organ enables the revolutionary committees to better grasp the Party's policies and strategies.

Revolutionary committees are also good because they "implement unified leadership." This facilitates "breaking down overlapping administrative organs and streamlining administration," reducing work levels, and overcoming bureaucratism. At the same time, it breaks down the past mechanical division of labor between politics and business, helping to correctly handle the relationship between politics and business, achieving political leadership over business and political leadership over production. Unified leadership also ensures that the county leadership organs have unified thinking and unified action, enabling them to quickly and effectively convey and implement Chairman Mao's various instructions.

Revolutionary committees are also good because they were born in the fiery crucible of the Cultural Revolution. Their members have undergone the test of the Cultural Revolution. They regard loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao as the greatest political principle and regard studying, implementing, propagating, and defending Chairman Mao's instructions as their most sacred duty. After the establishment of our county revolutionary committee, the first task was to vigorously promote the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought. The entire county organized a propaganda army of tens of thousands of people to vigorously propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the great revolutionary practices of Chairman Mao, village by village and team by team, bringing the mass movement of studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought to a new high tide.

Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions on the revolutionary three-in-one combination have pointed out the fundamental direction for the construction of revolutionary committees at all levels. We must implement these instructions in our actions and build the county revolutionary committee into a fighting command post that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, revolutionary, and closely connected with the masses, leading the people of the entire county to achieve comprehensive victory in the Cultural Revolution.

    发挥革命三结合的强大威力  夺取文化大革命的全面胜利
    河北省晋县革命委员会
    毛主席关于革命委员会的最新指示，我们热烈拥护，坚决照办！毛主席这一最新指示一传到我们县里，县革委会值班的常委立即召开会议，进行学习讨论，并且连夜开电话会议向全县传达。全县很快掀起了认真学习、热情宣传、坚决执行毛主席这一最新指示的热潮。
    根据我们的亲身体会，革命委员会就是好！
    毛主席教导我们：“要相信和依靠群众，相信和依靠人民解放军，相信和依靠干部的大多数。”“三结合”的革命委员会，把这三个方面在组织上紧密结合在一起，就显示出强大的生命力和巨大的优越性。在文化大革命的急风暴雨中冲杀出来的革命工人、贫下中农、红卫兵小将的代表，参加到革命委员会中来，使无产阶级政权有了深厚的群众基础，使革委会能够在最大程度上体现革命群众的意志，代表革命群众的利益。革命群众的代表不断地把广大群众的意见和要求反映到革委会来，使革委会能够步步走在群众路线上，事事办在革命群众的心坎上。人民解放军对伟大领袖毛主席最忠，对伟大的毛泽东思想最热爱，对毛主席的伟大战略部署跟得最紧。解放军代表参加革命委员会，不仅加强了无产阶级专政，而且把解放军的优良传统、优良作风带到革委会中来，促进了领导班子的革命化。我县革命委员会就是在解放军同志的带动下，坚持了突出无产阶级政治，狠抓政治思想工作。革命的老干部，斗争经验比较丰富，组织能力比较强。他们参加到新的权力机构中来，使革委会能够更好地掌握党的政策和策略。
    革命委员会好，还好在“实行一元化的领导”。这就有利于“打破重叠的行政机构，精兵简政”，减少工作层次，克服官僚主义；同时，打破了过去那种政治和业务的机械分工，有利于摆正政治和业务的关系，实现政治统帅业务，政治统帅生产。一元化的领导，还使县的领导机关思想统一，行动统一，能够又快又好地传达和落实毛主席的各项指示。
    革命委员会好，还好在它是在无产阶级文化大革命的烈火中诞生的。它的成员经历了文化大革命的战斗考验。他们把忠于伟大领袖毛主席看作是最大的政治，把学习、执行、宣传、捍卫毛主席的指示，作为自己最神圣的职责。我县革命委员会成立以后，第一件工作就是狠抓活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动。全县组织了万人宣传大军，大力宣传毛主席的最新指示，大力宣传毛主席的伟大革命实践，村村讲，队队讲，使全县活学活用毛泽东思想的群众运动掀起一个新的高潮。
    毛主席关于革命三结合的光辉指示，为各级革命委员会的建设指明了根本的方向。我们一定要句句落实到自己的行动当中，把县革命委员会建设成一个无限忠于毛主席的、革命化的、联系群众的战斗指挥部，带领全县人民去夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
