    Knocking Out Officialdom
    Political Commissar of the 6122nd Unit, Jiang Mianxi

    Last March, I went down to the 7th Company. Due to incorrect guiding ideology, I approached every problem from the perspective of educating others, always putting myself in the position of a "leader." Whether it was issuing orders here or criticizing there, I exerted a lot of effort, but the results were not significant. During the initial evaluation for the Four Good campaign, the comrades in the 7th Company gave me a lot of feedback, saying that my work was simplistic and my attitude was rough.

    The comrades' feedback made me reflect deeply. Soon, Chairman Mao's latest instructions on improving superior-subordinate relationships were passed down. Chairman Mao taught us: "To properly solve the problem of superior-subordinate relationships and improve the relationship between cadres and the masses, cadres should go down to the grassroots, walk around, and see for themselves. They should adhere to the mass line, consult with the masses on every matter, and be students of the masses. In a certain sense, the most intelligent and talented are those with the most practical experience—the soldiers."

    Chairman Mao's teachings made my heart clear. I realized that the problem was not that the soldiers were uncooperative, but that my own "officialdom" had not been knocked out. "Officialdom" is a "wall" between me and the soldiers. If "officialdom" is not knocked out, the "wall" cannot be torn down. "Officialdom" is also a "blindfold." If "officialdom" is not knocked out, one's perspective will be skewed.

    By the end of the year, during the final evaluation for the Four Good campaign, I went back to the 7th Company. This time, I went with the attitude of being a student of the masses, humbly learning from the soldiers. Upon arriving at the company, I openly checked my past mistakes and shortcomings at a military meeting, asking the comrades to help me and resolving to forever be a student of the soldiers and learn from them. In the company, I joined everyone in criticizing and repudiating revisionism, discussing the understanding of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, eating, living, studying, working, and entertaining with the soldiers, actively seeking out soldiers to talk and share thoughts, and sincerely making friends with them. The comrades were deeply moved. In the process of practicing the "five together" and being a student of the masses, I learned many precious things from them. The soldiers of the 7th Company, in the harsh winter, displayed a revolutionary spirit of enduring hardships and hard work, and not a single person complained. After returning from the construction site, they were covered in dirt but did not clean up, ignoring the cold and fatigue, and the first thing they did upon returning home was to study Chairman Mao's works. They achieved: hands never leaving Chairman Mao's books, mouths never leaving Chairman Mao's words, actions never leaving Chairman Mao's instructions, and hearts never leaving Chairman Mao's thoughts.

    I deeply felt that revolutionary soldiers have the deepest proletarian revolutionary feelings for Chairman Mao and are the most loyal to Chairman Mao's great thoughts. They love to read Chairman Mao's books the most and listen to Chairman Mao's words the most! Learn a little, use a little, say and do what is said. From the bottom of my heart, I felt that revolutionary soldiers are so lovable! Their most fundamental awakening and most outstanding virtues are precisely the places worth learning from.

    I turned the process of participating in the company's Four Good final evaluation into a process of being a student of the masses and humbly learning from them, and a process of transforming my subjective world. In this way, my feelings with the soldiers became deeper and our relationship became closer, making work easier, finding more solutions, and achieving better results. When I left the company to return to the headquarters, everyone rushed to carry my bag for me and said, "Commissar, you must come to our company more often!"

    Through two visits to the 7th Company with two different guiding ideologies, I obtained two different results. This made me understand even more the immense power of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. At the same time, it made me deeply realize that only by overcoming the "self" can "officialdom" be knocked out; only by knocking out "officialdom" can one blend in with the masses and be a student of the masses; only by blending in with the masses and being a student of the masses can one understand the masses, discover the masses' virtues and strengths, gain the masses' support and help, obtain true leadership and speaking rights, and do political and ideological work even better.

    In the future, I will definitely remember Chairman Mao's great teachings, overcome the "self," knock out "officialdom," and at any time and in any situation, always maintain the demeanor of an ordinary soldier, be a servant of the people for life, be a student of the masses for life, and follow the great leader Chairman Mao to revolutionize for life.

    打掉官气
    六一二二部队政委　姜勉希
    去年三月，我下到七连。由于指导思想不对，到了七连处处站在教育别人的角度上去处理问题，以
  “领导”自居，不是在这里发号施令，就是在那里指责批评。结果费劲不小，效果却不大。四好初评的时候，七连的同志还给我提了不少意见，说我工作简单，态度粗暴。
    同志们的意见引起了我的深思。不久，毛主席关于搞好上下级关系的最新指示传下来了。毛主席教导我们说：“要很好地解决上下级关系问题，搞好干部和群众的关系。以后干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”毛主席的教导使我的心豁然明亮。我认识到发生问题的原因不是战士不听话，而是自己的“官”气没有打掉。“官”气就是我和战士之间的一道“墙”，“官”气不打掉，“墙”就倒不了。“官”气又是一个“蒙眼罩”，如果不把“官”气打掉，看问题就会看偏了。
    年底总评的时候，我又到了七连。这次去，我是抱着当群众的小学生，虚心向战士们学习而去的。一到连队，我就在军人大会上，主动地向同志们检查了以前工作中的缺点错误，要求同志们对我进行帮助，决心永远做战士们的小学生，永远向战士们学习。在连队，我和大家一起斗私批修，一起谈学习毛主席最新指示的体会，和战士们同吃、同住、同学习、同劳动、同娱乐，主动找战士谈心、交心，热情地和战士交知心朋友，使同志们深受感动。在我和战士实行“五同”，甘当群众小学生的过程中，从他们身上我学到了很多宝贵的东西。七连的战士们，在隆冬严寒的季节里施工，发扬了吃大苦、耐大劳的革命精神，没有一个人叫苦。从施工现场回来，他们满身泥土都没打扫，不顾寒冷和疲劳，到家第一件事便是学习毛主席著作。他们做到了：手不离毛主席的书，口不离毛主席的话，行动不离毛主席的指示，心不离毛主席的思想。
    我深切地体会到：革命战士对毛主席的无产阶级革命感情最深，对毛主席伟大思想最忠。他们最爱读毛主席的书，最听毛主席的话！学一点，用一点，说到做到。我从内心感到，革命战士是多么可爱呀！他们这些最根本的觉悟，最突出的优点，正是最值得我学习的地方。
    我把参加连队四好总评的过程，变成了甘当群众小学生、向群众虚心学习的过程，变成了改造主观世界的过程。这样，我和战士们的感情越来越深厚，关系越来越密切，工作就顺手了，办法就多了，效果也就好了。当我离开连队回机关时，大家争着为我扛背包，并对我说：“政委，以后要经常到我们连队来呀！”
    通过两次到七连，两种不同的指导思想，得出两种不同的效果。这使我更加懂得毛主席最新指示的巨大威力。同时，使我深刻地体会到：只有斗倒“私”字，才能打掉“官”气；只有打掉“官”气，才能和群众打成一片，做群众的小学生；只有和群众打成一片，做群众的小学生，才能了解群众，发现群众的优点和长处，得到群众的支持和帮助，取得真正的领导权和发言权，才能把政治思想工作做得好上加好。
    今后，我一定要牢记毛主席的伟大教导，斗倒“私”字，打掉“官”气，在任何时候和任何情况下，都永远保持普通一兵的本色，当一辈子人民的勤务员，做一辈子群众的小学生，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席干一辈子革命。
