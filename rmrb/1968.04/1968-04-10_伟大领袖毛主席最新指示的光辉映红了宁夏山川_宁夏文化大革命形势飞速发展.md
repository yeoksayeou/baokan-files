The overall situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution across the country is excellent, not just good. The entire situation is better than at any other time. In a few more months, the situation will be even better.

Chairman Mao's latest instructions have illuminated Ningxia's mountains and rivers. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Ningxia is developing rapidly. Out of the 18 counties and cities in the entire region, 16 have established revolutionary committees. The vast majority of industrial and mining enterprises and people's communes have achieved revolutionary three-in-one combinations. Over a quarter of the population in the entire region has participated in Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Through extensive and in-depth revolutionary criticism, the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres have significantly enhanced their class struggle consciousness and awareness of line struggle.

A Xinhua News Agency report from Yinchuan on April 9 stated: The shining light of the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions has illuminated Ningxia's mountains and rivers. A mass movement to fully implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions is surging forward across the entire autonomous region. Currently, revolutionary great unity, revolutionary three-in-one combinations, and revolutionary criticism have all reached new highs. Out of the 18 counties and cities in the entire region, the capital of the autonomous region, Yinchuan City, the emerging coal industry base of Shiquan Mountain City, and Guyuan under the Sixiang Mountains, along with 13 other counties and cities, have achieved revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combinations, establishing revolutionary committees. The vast majority of industrial and mining enterprises and people's communes in the entire region have also achieved revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combinations. Through extensive and in-depth revolutionary criticism, the revolutionary masses' class struggle consciousness and awareness of line struggle have significantly improved, further promoting ideological revolutionization.

The excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Ningxia region fully validates the great leader Chairman Mao's wise judgment: "The overall situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution across the country is excellent, not just good. The entire situation is better than at any other time. In a few more months, the situation will be even better."

In the new situation of achieving decisive victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary factions and broad revolutionary masses in Ningxia, while implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, have always adhered to Chairman Mao's great teaching of "never forgetting class struggle," firmly grasping the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines. On one hand, they struggle against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism and anarchist tendencies within the revolutionary ranks, thoroughly criticizing the bourgeois "self" and establishing the proletarian "public," continuously promoting the revolutionization of people's ideology. On the other hand, they continue to deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, striking down the various plots of a handful of class enemies to sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution from the right or ultra-left, firmly grasping the direction of the struggle.

The great teacher Chairman Mao teaches us: "It is necessary to guide the petty-bourgeois ideology within our ranks onto the track of proletarian revolution. This is a key issue for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to achieve victory." The proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses in Ningxia, following Chairman Mao's teaching, with the active assistance of the PLA support-left forces stationed in Ningxia, have established various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. In just a few months, they have established over 5,400 sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with the number of participants accounting for more than a quarter of the total population of the autonomous region. The broad proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses, in the study classes, actively learn and apply Mao Zedong Thought, criticize and repudiate revisionism, consciously sparking a revolution in the depths of their souls. Many leaders of revolutionary mass organizations, through study, have come to realize that in the new situation, whether one can consciously criticize and repudiate oneself is a fundamental attitude of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. With boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, they fiercely criticize the "self" in their minds, greatly promoting the consolidation and development of revolutionary great unity.

To accelerate the achievement of revolutionary three-in-one combinations, the PLA support-left forces stationed in Ningxia and the revolutionary masses, following Chairman Mao's latest instructions on cadre issues, have established Mao Zedong Thought study classes for revolutionary three-in-one combinations, helping a large number of cadres to criticize and repudiate themselves, raise their awareness of line struggle, correctly treat the masses, correctly treat themselves, and bravely stand up for the revolution. At the same time, they help the broad revolutionary masses overcome bourgeois and petty-bourgeois factionalism on cadre issues and correctly treat cadres. In a short period, just the support-left forces have established over 400 sessions of Mao Zedong Thought study classes for revolutionary three-in-one combinations. Many cadres criticize themselves during the day in the study classes and return to their units at night to talk with revolutionary masses, seeking opinions, forming a lively scene of cadres voluntarily checking themselves and the masses enthusiastically helping, greatly promoting the development of revolutionary three-in-one combinations.

After more than a year of severe class struggle tests, the proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses in Ningxia, in the process of fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, concentrate forces, and concentrate targets, launching a new high tide of great exposure, great criticism, and great struggle against Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Ningxia. In the rural areas of Ningxia, revolutionary criticism battlefields have been set up everywhere. Various ethnic poor and lower-middle peasants and rural revolutionary cadres, with Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, thoroughly criticize Liu Shaoqi and his agents in Ningxia for their heinous crimes of attempting to restore capitalism in the countryside. Through revolutionary criticism, the class consciousness and awareness of line struggle of the proletarian revolutionary factions, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres have been further enhanced. They are spirited and full of fighting spirit, shoulder the double burden of revolution and production, and continue to make new contributions in grasping revolution and promoting production.

The rapid development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Ningxia region is a victory of fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, a victory of criticizing and repudiating oneself, and a victory of firmly grasping class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. The unprecedented excellent revolutionary situation has laid a solid foundation for establishing revolutionary three-in-one combination temporary power organs across the entire region. Quickly establishing the autonomous region revolutionary committee has become a necessity for the development of the revolutionary situation and an urgent demand of the broad revolutionary masses. The broad revolutionary masses of various ethnic groups, including the Hui and Han, are further implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, consolidating and developing revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combinations, firmly grasping revolution, vigorously promoting production, and doing a better job in all aspects, welcoming with practical actions the victorious birth of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee.

    全国的无产阶级文化大革命形势大好，不是小好。整个形势比以往任何时候都好。
    再有几个月的时间，整个形势将会变得更好。						毛泽东
    伟大领袖毛主席最新指示的光辉映红了宁夏山川
    宁夏文化大革命形势飞速发展
    全区十八个县、市中已有十六个建立革委会；绝大多数工矿企业和人民公社实现革命三结合；全区有四分之一以上的群众参加毛泽东思想学习班；通过广泛深入的革命大批判，革命群众和革命干部的阶级斗争观念和路线斗争觉悟有很大提高。
    新华社银川九日电　伟大领袖毛主席最新指示的光辉映红了宁夏山川，一个全面落实毛主席最新指示的群众运动，正在全自治区波澜壮阔地向前发展。现在，全区革命大联合、革命三结合和革命大批判都出现了新的高潮。全区十八个县、市中，已有自治区首府银川市、新兴煤炭工业基地石咀山市和六盘山下的固原等十六个县、市实现了革命的大联合和革命的三结合，建立了革命委员会。全区绝大多数工矿企业和人民公社也都实现了革命大联合和革命三结合。通过广泛深入地开展革命的大批判，全区革命群众的阶级斗争观念和路线斗争觉悟有了很大提高，进一步促进了思想革命化。
    宁夏地区无产阶级文化大革命的大好形势，完全证实了伟大领袖毛主席的英明论断：“全国的无产阶级文化大革命形势大好，不是小好。整个形势比以往任何时候都好。”“再有几个月的时间，整个形势将会变得更好。”
    宁夏无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众在取得无产阶级文化大革命的决定性胜利的新形势下，在落实毛主席最新指示的过程中，始终遵循毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大教导，狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争。他们一方面同革命队伍内部的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性和无政府主义思潮斗，大破资产阶级的“私”字，大立无产阶级的“公”字，不断促进人的思想革命化；一方面继续深入开展革命大批判，痛击一小撮阶级敌人从右的方面或极“左”方面破坏无产阶级文化大革命的种种阴谋活动，牢牢掌握斗争大方向。
    伟大导师毛主席教导我们：“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题。”宁夏无产阶级革命派和革命群众，遵照毛主席的这一教导，在解放军驻宁夏支左部队的积极帮助下，办起了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。他们在几个月之内，就办起了毛泽东思想学习班五千四百多期，参加学习班的人数占到全自治区总人口的四分之一以上。广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，在学习班里活学活用毛泽东思想，斗私批修，自觉地在灵魂深处爆发革命。许多革命群众组织的负责人通过学习，认识到在新形势下，能不能自觉斗私，是忠不忠于伟大领袖毛主席，忠不忠于毛泽东思想，忠不忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的根本态度问题。他们怀着无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的深厚的无产阶级感情，狠斗自己头脑里的“私”字，大大地推动了革命大联合的巩固和发展。
    为了加速实现革命的三结合，人民解放军驻宁夏支左部队和革命群众遵照毛主席关于干部问题的最新指示，大办三结合的毛泽东思想学习班，帮助大批干部斗私批修，提高路线斗争觉悟，正确对待群众，正确对待自己，勇敢地站出来革命；同时帮助广大革命群众克服干部问题上的资产阶级、小资产阶级派性，正确对待干部。在短期内，仅支左部队就举办了三结合的毛泽东思想学习班四百多期。许多干部白天在学习班里斗私，晚上回本单位找革命群众谈心，征求意见，形成了干部主动检查，群众热情帮助的生动局面，大大促进了革命三结合的发展。
    经过一年多阶级斗争严峻考验的宁夏无产阶级革命派和革命群众，在全面落实毛主席最新指示的过程中，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，集中力量，集中目标，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在宁夏的代理人掀起了大揭发、大批判、大斗争的新高潮。在宁夏农村，也到处摆下了革命大批判的战场，各族贫下中农和农村革命干部以毛泽东思想为武器，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其在宁夏的代理人在农村复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。通过革命大批判，进一步提高了无产阶级革命派和革命群众、革命干部的阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟。他们精神焕发、斗志昂扬地挑起了革命和生产两副重担，不断在抓革命、促生产中作出了新的贡献。
    宁夏地区无产阶级文化大革命形势的飞速发展，是全面落实毛主席最新指示的胜利，是斗私批修的胜利，是狠抓阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的胜利。空前大好的革命形势，为宁夏全区建立革命的三结合的临时权力机构奠定了坚实的基础。尽快地成立自治区革命委员会，已是革命形势发展的需要和广大革命群众的迫切要求。全区广大回、汉等各族革命群众，正进一步落实毛主席的最新指示，巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合，狠抓革命，猛促生产，把各方面工作做得更好，以实际行动迎接宁夏回族自治区革命委员会的胜利诞生。
