No matter how busy with work, I always make time every day to labor with the workers and listen to the masses' opinions. When the masses want to discuss thoughts and study work with me, I also cannot do without the masses. I am determined to:

Always be with the workers

Liaoning Fengcheng Revolutionary Committee Member, Li Jihui

I am a worker. When the revolutionary committee of the mine was established, everyone elected me as a committee member. For the first three days, I thought about this responsibility while eating and sleeping: this burden is heavy, can I carry it? Then I thought, this power is given by Chairman Mao and by the broad revolutionary masses. I must not disappoint Chairman Mao's cultivation, and I must not disappoint the workers' trust. I must definitely carry this burden.

After the revolutionary committee was established, everyone sat down to discuss the mine's struggle, criticism, and transformation issues. We held meetings for two consecutive days, and I did not take the time to go down to the mine to work. Some workers saw my face and said, "Old Li, we haven't seen you go down to the mine to drill for the past two days. We really miss you!"

At that time, I did not feel anything was wrong, but later I thought about it and felt that there was a lot to it. I thought about how in our mine and other units, many cadres who were originally workers, after becoming cadres, initially still paid attention to connecting with the masses and caring about the workers' work and life. Later, they forgot Chairman Mao's teaching that "all our cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people," and thought of themselves as "officials" who could work less or not work at all, rarely going among the masses, and becoming more and more distant from them, eventually making mistakes. Shouldn't this serve as a warning to myself? Although I have just become a member of the revolutionary committee and have not yet reached that stage, I must always be vigilant and use Mao Zedong Thought to demand of myself, otherwise I will also make mistakes. Therefore, I am determined to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, to always maintain the character of the working class, to place myself among the masses, to be an ordinary worker, rather than placing myself above the workers.

After that, no matter how busy the work is, I always take out some time every day to go down to the mine and labor with the workers, discuss the revolutionary and production situation with them, listen to the masses' opinions, and work together to improve the revolution and production of our mine. Some comrades who used to work with me said, "Old Li, you are at least a committee member, you should focus more on the overall work of the mine. We can each do a little more, and bring out your share, you doing less won't matter!" Whenever I encounter such situations, I patiently explain to them, "The production tasks, everyone can bring out for me, but the thought revolutionization, no one can replace me, I still have to come to the masses and 'revolutionize' with everyone!"

I am the leader of the drilling team, and I have been a worker for more than twelve years, so I am quite familiar with this drilling work and have also understood the machine's temperament. Working with worker comrades, when they have knots in their thoughts, they come to me to talk, when they encounter difficulties in their work, they come to me to discuss and solve them, when the machine has problems, they come to me for help in troubleshooting. The masses are willing to come to me, and I cannot do without the masses. Some workers said, "Old Li became a member of the revolutionary committee, but he is still heart to heart and shoulder to shoulder with us workers, fighting together!" This is the encouragement and hope of the worker comrades for me, but I myself still have a lot to do. As a member of the revolutionary committee, I should do my best to never leave the masses and never leave labor. If I find that my pulse does not match the masses', I should immediately find the problem in the depths of my soul, use Mao Zedong Thought to diagnose it, and use Mao Zedong Thought to "treat" it. Matching the pulse with the masses is to match it in being forever loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. With this "match," we can have common language, common thoughts and feelings, and common actions, and forever maintain the character of the working class.

### 不管工作多忙，我每天都抽出时间和工人一起劳动，听取群众的意见。群众愿意找我谈思想，研究工作，我也离不开群众。我决心：永远和工人在一起

    不管工作多忙，我每天都抽出时间和工人一起劳动，听取群众的意见。群众愿意找我谈思想，研究工作，我也离不开群众。我决心：
    永远和工人在一起
    辽宁凤城矿革委会委员　李积慧
    我是个工人，矿革命委员会成立的时候，大家选我当了委员。开头三天，我吃饭、睡觉都在想：这副担子很重，我能挑起来吗？又一想，这大权是毛主席给的，是广大革命群众给的，我决不能辜负毛主席的培养，决不能辜负工人的信任，我一定要把这副担子挑起来。
    革委会成立后，大家坐下来研究矿上斗批改的问题。一连开了两天会，我没有抽时间下矿井劳动。有的工人见了我的面就说：“老李，这两天没见你下矿井打眼，可真想你啊！”
    当时我不觉得有什么，过后一琢磨，觉得这里边大有文章。我联想到过去我们矿和其他单位的一些干部，有不少人都是工人出身，当了干部之后，起初还注意联系群众，关心工人的工作和生活。后来，他们忘记了毛主席的“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员”的教导，以为自己是“官”，可以少劳动，不劳动，很少到群众中去，离群众越来越远，结果犯了错误。这难道不应该引起自己的警惕吗？虽然我刚当革委会的委员，还不至于马上发展到那种地步，但必须时刻警惕，要用毛泽东思想要求自己，不然同样会犯错误。所以，我决心遵照毛主席的教导，要永远保持工人阶级的本色，把自己置于群众之中，当个普通的工人，而不是把自己置于工人之上。
    以后，不管工作怎样忙，我每天都抽出一定时间下矿井，和工人一起劳动，一起议论革命和生产形势，听取群众的意见，和他们共同商量，搞好我矿的革命和生产。有些过去跟我一起工作的同志对我说：“老李，你大小也是个委员，应该多抓抓全矿的工作。我们每个人多干一点，就把你那份带出来了，你少干点不算啥！”每逢碰到这种情况，我就耐心地给他们解释说：“生产任务，大家可以给我带出来，可是思想革命化，谁也不能代替我，还得我自己到群众中来，和大家一起‘化’！”
    我是凿眼组组长，当了十二年多工人，对凿眼这工作比较熟悉，也摸透了机器的脾气。和工人同志一起劳动，他们思想上有疙瘩，找我谈谈，工作碰到了困难，找我研究解决，机器有了毛病，找我帮助排除故障。群众愿意找我，我也离不开群众。有的工人说：“老李当了革委会委员，还是和咱工人心贴心，肩并肩，一起战斗！”这是工人同志对我的鼓舞，对我的希望，可是我自己还做得很不够。作为一个革委会的委员，应该做到：永远不脱离群众，不脱离劳动，如果发现自己的脉搏同群众的脉搏不合拍，就要马上从自己的灵魂深处找毛病，用毛泽东思想去诊断，用毛泽东思想去“治病”。和群众的脉搏合拍，就是合在永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上。有了这个“合拍”，才能有共同的语言，共同的思想感情，共同的行动，才能永远保持工人阶级的本色。
