The revolutionary committee of Agang Town Coal Mine, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, has been persistently carrying out revolutionary criticism. The spiritual outlook of the workers has undergone significant changes, and the revolutionary and production situations are getting better and better, with good deeds and good people emerging continuously.

The Agang Town Coal Mine revolutionary committee was established in November of last year. After its establishment, some workers became complacent and relaxed, saying: "The handful of capitalist roaders within the party in the mining area have been overthrown and thoroughly criticized, and they can no longer stir up big waves." Some members of the revolutionary committee thought that power had been seized from the hands of the capitalist roaders, and they could now relax. Others believed that after fighting the revolution for more than a year, the fundamental issue of the revolution—the issue of power—had been resolved, and now it was time to focus on production. In short, these comrades lost their revolutionary vigilance and weakened their class struggle awareness in the face of the good situation. However, the class enemies were not willing to accept their demise. At this time, a handful of capitalist roaders within the mine, in collusion with the ghosts and snakes in the mining area and the remnants of the Kuomintang, took the opportunity to engage in secret plots and sabotage, attempting to overthrow the newly established revolutionary committee and implement a capitalist restoration. On one hand, they attempted to bribe and incite some members of the revolutionary committee, sowing discord among them; on the other hand, they interfered in mass organizations, stirring up trouble. They told the leaders of mass organizations who had once taken the wrong side and the workers, "You are working so hard for production, for what? In the end, they still say you have not stood on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line. Don't work so hard for the revolutionary committee!" They incited some leaders of mass organizations with serious individualism, who had not been selected into the leadership at various levels, saying, "The kingdom we fought for with blood and sweat is being taken by them, can you swallow this?" While carrying out these evil activities, the class enemies also used various means to sabotage the revolution and production, deliberately causing production accidents. The class enemies even started compiling black materials against the revolutionary committee from the day it was established, filing complaints everywhere, attempting to strangle the newly born proletarian revolutionary power.

Under the sabotage and incitement of the class enemies, the revolutionary committee itself also relaxed its grip on class struggle and class education for a time, resulting in the development of anarchist tendencies among the workers. The comrades in charge of production in the revolutionary committee, although they had formulated specific production measures with the masses and organized production activities, did not grasp the fundamental issue of class struggle, so the results were minimal. The comrades from the People's Liberation Army stationed in the mine, after analysis and research, decided to first help the revolutionary committees and revolutionary leading groups at various levels in the mine to study Chairman Mao's great teachings on class and class struggle, strengthening their class struggle awareness. Chairman Mao teaches: "Never forget class struggle." Chairman Mao's great teachings sounded the alarm for the members of the leading cadres at various levels, and everyone deeply realized that under any circumstances, class struggle must always be kept in mind. Forgetting class struggle is the greatest disloyalty to Chairman Mao. The revolutionary committee, born in the storm of class struggle, must be the command center leading the broad revolutionary masses in class struggle, and must lead the broad revolutionary masses to launch a sustained attack on the class enemies, in order to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

On this basis, the revolutionary committee of the mining area held various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes. In the study classes, the broad masses of workers repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's great teachings on class and class struggle, studied Vice Chairman Lin's relevant instructions, and carried out extensive "recall," "compare," and "examine" activities. Through recalling the bitterness of class struggle, the bitterness of national oppression, and the bitterness of the capitalist reactionary line, comparing the old and new societies, comparing the two lines, and examining their own positions and fighting spirit, the broad masses of workers greatly enhanced their love for the great leader Chairman Mao, for the great thought of Mao Zedong, for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and for the new society; they intensified their hatred for China's Khrushchev, for China's Khrushchev's capitalist reactionary line, and for the old society; further raised their class struggle awareness, strengthened their class struggle consciousness, and launched a magnificent revolutionary criticism throughout the mine. Through severely criticizing China's Khrushchev's advocacy of the "extinction of class struggle" theory, severely criticizing the reactionary fallacies peddled by the handful of capitalist roaders within the party in the mining area, such as "regardless of whether the cat is white or black, as long as it catches mice, it is a good cat," the broad masses of workers further exposed the crimes of the capitalist roaders in protecting and harboring traitors, spies, and remnants of the Kuomintang, and quickly launched a "people's war" to smash the class enemies' sabotage and disruption. They quickly exposed the handful of traitors, spies, and remnants of the Kuomintang hidden within the ranks of the workers, smashed their evil plan to sabotage the revolution, sabotage production, overthrow the newly established revolutionary committee, and implement a capitalist restoration, and carried out criticism and struggle against them, implementing proletarian dictatorship.

The living reality of class struggle deeply educated the broad revolutionary masses, making everyone fully realize that the newly born revolutionary committee can only be consolidated by leading the broad revolutionary workers to firmly grasp class struggle. Otherwise, it would be in danger of being overthrown.

The class struggle awareness of the revolutionary workers of Agang Town Coal Mine has never been as high as it is today, their spiritual outlook has never been as good as it is today, their revolutionary enthusiasm has never been as great as it is today, and the relationship between the cadres and the masses has never been as close as it is today. The movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought and implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions has never been as extensive and deep as it is today. Now, reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions have become the conscious actions of the broad revolutionary workers.

Recently, Chairman Mao pointed out profoundly: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is essentially a great political revolution carried out by the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes under the conditions of socialism, a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and its leadership of the broad revolutionary people and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie." Chairman Mao's latest instructions further armed the broad revolutionary workers of Agang Town Coal Mine. The members of the revolutionary committees and revolutionary leading groups at various levels in the mining area, in accordance with Chairman Mao's great teaching of "being both an 'official' and a common people," except for a small number who stayed behind to handle daily affairs, the majority went to the front lines with the workers to grasp class struggle, work together, and study Chairman Mao's works together. Under the leadership of the revolutionary committee, the broad revolutionary workers are actively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, breaking down selfishness and establishing public spirit. At present, in this coal mine, labor is not calculated for rewards, work is not done for conditions, and good deeds and good people who work wholeheartedly for the country to increase coal production are emerging continuously.

    阶级斗争　一抓就灵
    阿干镇煤矿革委会在解放军帮助下持久开展革命大批判
    职工精神面貌发生很大变化，革命和生产形势越来越好，好人好事不断出现
    本报讯　甘肃省阿干镇煤矿革命委员会在驻矿人民解放军支左人员的帮助下，狠抓阶级斗争和路线斗争教育，全矿职工精神面貌发生很大变化，革命、生产形势越来越好。二月份的原煤产量比一月份增长百分之四十五，三月份又比二月份增长百分之二十九。四月以来，生产继续稳步上升。
    阿干镇煤矿的革命委员会是去年十一月成立的。革委会成立后，在一部分职工中曾产生了盲目乐观和松劲情绪。有人说：矿区党内一小撮走资派已经被斗倒斗臭，再也兴不起大风大浪了。革委会的领导成员中，也有人认为大权已经从走资派的手里夺过来，可以松口气了。还有人认为抓革命抓了一年多，革命的根本问题——政权问题已经解决了，现在该集中力量抓抓生产了。总之，这些同志在大好形势面前，丧失了革命警惕性，阶级斗争观念淡薄了。但是，阶级敌人并不甘心于自己的灭亡。就在这个时候，矿内一小撮走资派伙同矿区的牛鬼蛇神、国民党残渣余孽，乘机大搞阴谋破坏活动，企图颠覆新生的革命委员会，实行资本主义复辟。他们一方面对革委会某些成员进行拉拢腐蚀，挑拨革委会成员之间的关系；一方面插手群众组织，挑拨离间。他们对一度站错队的群众组织头头和职工说：“你们拚命搞生产为了个什么？吃力不讨好！到头来还说你没有站到无产阶级革命路线上。不要给革委会卖命！”他们对一些有严重个人主义、未被选进各级领导班子的群众组织的头头煽动说：“一起流血流汗打下的江山，叫他们去坐，这口气能咽下吗？”阶级敌人在进行这些罪恶活动的同时，还使出种种手段，乘机破坏革命，破坏生产，有意制造生产事故。阶级敌人甚至从矿革委会成立的第一天起，就大整矿革委会的黑材料，四处“告状”，企图扼杀新生的无产阶级革命政权。
    在阶级敌人的破坏和挑动下，革命委员会本身又一度放松了抓阶级斗争和阶级教育，因而职工中的无政府主义思潮有所发展。革委会管生产的同志，虽然同群众一起制订过具体生产措施，并组织过增产活动，因为没有抓住阶级斗争这个根本问题，所以收效很小。驻矿支左的人民解放军同志经过分析研究，决定首先帮助矿各级革命委员会、革命领导小组大学毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的伟大教导，增强阶级斗争观念。伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争。”毛主席的伟大教导，给各级领导班子成员敲起了警钟，大家深深认识到，无论在任何情况下，都必须念念不忘阶级斗争。忘记了阶级斗争，就是对毛主席最大的不忠。在阶级斗争暴风雨中光荣诞生的革命委员会，必须是领导广大革命群众进行阶级斗争的战斗指挥部，必须领导广大革命群众，持久地向阶级敌人发动进攻，才能彻底夺取无产阶级文化大革命的全面胜利。
    在这个基础上，矿区革命委员会举办了各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班。在学习班里，广大职工反复学习了毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的伟大教导，学习了林副主席的有关指示，并且广泛开展了“忆”、“比”、“查”的活动。广大职工通过忆阶级苦、忆民族苦、忆资产阶级反动路线的苦，将新旧社会加以对比，两条路线加以对比，检查自己的立场和斗志，大大激发了对伟大领袖毛主席，对伟大的毛泽东思想，对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，对新社会的无比热爱；激发了对中国赫鲁晓夫，对中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线，对旧社会的无比仇恨；进一步提高了阶级斗争觉悟，增强了阶级斗争观念，在全矿开展起一场轰轰烈烈的革命大批判。广大职工通过狠批中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“阶级斗争熄灭”论，狠批矿区党内一小撮走资派所贩卖的“不管白猫黑猫，能抓住老鼠就是好猫”的反动谬论，进而揭露了走资派重用包庇叛徒、特务、国民党残渣余孽等反革命罪行，迅速掀起了一场粉碎阶级敌人破坏捣乱的“人民战争”。很快地就把隐藏在职工队伍内部的一小撮叛徒、特务、国民党残渣余孽等牛鬼蛇神揪了出来，粉碎了他们妄图破坏革命，破坏生产，颠覆新生的革命委员会，实现资本主义复辟的罪恶计划，并对他们进行了批判斗争，实行了无产阶级专政。
    活生生的阶级斗争现实，深深教育了广大革命群众，使大家充分认识到新生的革命委员会，只有在领导广大革命职工狠抓阶级斗争中，才能不断得到巩固。否则，它就有被颠覆的危险。
    阿干镇煤矿革命职工的阶级斗争觉悟从来没有象今天这样高，精神面貌从来没有象今天这样好，革命干劲从来没有象今天这样大，干群关系从来没有象今天这样密切，活学活用毛泽东思想，落实毛主席最新指示的群众运动，从来没有象今天这样广泛深入。现在，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，已成为广大革命职工的自觉行动。
    最近，毛主席深刻地指出：“无产阶级文化大革命，实质上是在社会主义条件下，无产阶级反对资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的政治大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。”毛主席的最新指示，更进一步武装了阿干镇煤矿的广大革命职工。矿区各级革命委员会、革命领导小组的成员，遵照毛主席的“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的伟大教导，除少部分留下值班处理日常事务外，绝大部分都和工人一道抓阶级斗争，一起劳动，一起学习毛主席著作。广大革命职工在矿革委会的领导下，大力活学活用毛泽东思想，破私立公。目前，在这个煤矿里，劳动不计报酬，工作不讲条件，一心为国家增产煤炭的好人好事不断出现。
