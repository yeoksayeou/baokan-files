Japanese figures from various circles recently spoke to Chinese journalists, enthusiastically hailing Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence. They pointed out that Chairman Mao's statement will further promote the struggle of all peoples of the world against their common enemy, American imperialism, and its lackeys, helping oppressed nations and peoples to achieve liberation sooner.

The president of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, Nakajima Takeshiro, pointed out that Chairman Mao's statement profoundly expounds the essence of the racial discrimination issue. He said, "Chairman Mao pointed out in the statement: 'The contradiction between the broad masses of American blacks and the American ruling class is a class contradiction.' 'The broad masses of American blacks and the broad laboring masses of American whites have common interests and common struggle targets.' These judgments are of extremely important and profound significance. As Chairman Mao pointed out: 'Only by overthrowing the reactionary rule of the American monopoly capitalist class and destroying the system of colonialism and imperialism can American blacks achieve thorough liberation.'"

Nakajima said, American imperialism is the common enemy of all peoples of the world. The struggle for liberation by American blacks, the struggle of the Vietnamese people against American aggression for national salvation, the struggle of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and all oppressed peoples and nations against American imperialism and its lackeys, are all class struggles.

Nakajima said: The peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and all oppressed peoples and nations of the world must consciously follow Chairman Mao's teachings. They must use revolutionary violence to counter revolutionary violence.

He pointed out: "The peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and all oppressed peoples and nations of the world, through their struggle practice, have recognized that Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest thought of our time. Therefore, they infinitely love and admire the great Mao Zedong Thought."

The chairman of the Asian-African Writers' Bureau of Japan, Shiraishi Hitoshi, said, the Asian-African Writers' Bureau of Japan enthusiastically supports Chairman Mao's statement in support of the struggle of American blacks against violence, and fully supports and sympathizes with the struggle of American blacks against violence.

Shiraishi said, as Chairman Mao pointed out: "American racial discrimination is a product of colonialism and imperialism. 'Only by overthrowing the reactionary rule of the American monopoly capitalist class and destroying the system of colonialism and imperialism can American blacks achieve thorough liberation.' Chairman Mao's judgments not only give profound guidance to the American black masses but also bring great encouragement to all oppressed nations and peoples of the world."

A member of the Japan Journalists' Union said, Chairman Mao's statement once again reveals the great truth that "national struggles, in the final analysis, are a class struggle issue." American blacks will combine their struggle with the struggle of the American working class. They will use revolutionary violence to counter revolutionary violence and strive for thorough liberation.

He said, we Japanese people must respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "people of all countries, workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and all those who want to oppose American imperialism, take action, and give strong support to the struggle of American blacks," strengthen and develop the current anti-American patriotic struggle to demand the removal of American military bases and the return of Okinawa, drive American imperialism out of Japan, and struggle for the true independence of Japan.

    日本各界人士欢呼毛主席声明具有伟大的国际意义
    必须用革命的暴力反对反革命的暴力
    决心加强日本人民反美爱国斗争把美帝从日本赶出去
    新华社东京十九日电　日本各界人士最近向中国记者发表谈话，热烈欢呼毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明。他们指出，毛主席的声明必将进一步促进全世界人民反对共同敌人美帝国主义及其帮凶们的斗争，使全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民早日获得解放。
    日中文化交流协会理事长中岛健藏指出，毛主席的声明，精辟地阐明了种族歧视问题的实质。他说，毛主席在声明中指出：“美国广大黑人同美国统治集团之间的矛盾，是阶级矛盾。”“美国广大黑人同美国白人中的广大劳动人民，有着共同的利益和共同的斗争目标。”这些论断具有极其重要的深刻的意义。正如毛主席所指出：“只有推翻美国垄断资产阶级的反动统治，摧毁殖民主义、帝国主义制度，美国黑人才能够取得彻底解放。”
    中岛说，美帝国主义是全世界人民的共同敌人。美国黑人的解放斗争，越南人民的抗美救国斗争，亚非拉人民和全世界被压迫人民、被压迫民族同美帝国主义及其帮凶的斗争，都是阶级斗争。
    中岛说：亚非拉以及全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族必须自觉地遵循毛主席的教导。他们必须以革命的暴力反击反革命的暴力。
    他指出：“亚非拉人民和全世界被压迫人民、被压迫民族，通过斗争实践，认识到毛泽东思想是当代最伟大的思想。因此，他们无限热爱和崇拜伟大的毛泽东思想。”
    亚非作家日本委员会委员长白石凡说，亚非作家日本委员会热烈拥护毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明，全力支持和声援美国黑人的抗暴斗争。
    白石说，正如毛主席所指出：“美国的种族歧视，是殖民主义、帝国主义制度的产物。”“只有推翻美国垄断资产阶级的反动统治，摧毁殖民主义、帝国主义制度，美国黑人才能够取得彻底解放。”毛主席的这些论断，不仅给美国黑人群众，而且给全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民以极为深刻的教导，并且给他们带来了巨大的鼓舞。
    日本记者同盟的一个成员说，毛主席的声明又一次揭示了“民族斗争，说到底，是一个阶级斗争问题”这一伟大真理。美国黑人将把自己的斗争同美国工人阶级的斗争结合起来。他们将用革命的暴力反对反革命的暴力，争取彻底的解放。
    他说，我们日本人民必须响应毛主席提出的“世界各国的工人、农民、革命知识分子和一切愿意反对美帝国主义的人们，行动起来，给予美国黑人的斗争以强大的声援”的伟大号召，加强和发展目前正在进行的要求撤除美国军事基地、要求归还冲绳等反美爱国斗争，把美帝国主义从日本赶出去，为争取日本的真正独立而奋斗。
