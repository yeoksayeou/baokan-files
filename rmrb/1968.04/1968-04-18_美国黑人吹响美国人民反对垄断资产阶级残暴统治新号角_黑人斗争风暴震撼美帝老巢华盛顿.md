The wave of anti-violence struggle launched by American blacks on April 4 has shaken the United States and the entire world like a thunderclap. In this struggle, the increasingly awakened black masses have displayed a fearless and indomitable spirit, courageously and tenaciously fighting against the reactionary rule of the American monopoly bourgeoisie in the heart of American imperialism, Washington D.C., turning the capital of this number one imperialist country into a battlefield of smoke and rubble.

Washington D.C. has a population of over 700,000, of which 66% are black. Due to the strict control of the reactionary ruling clique, it has escaped the impact of large-scale black anti-violence struggles in the past few years. However, this year, the new wave of anti-violence struggles launched by American blacks has struck it first and foremost. This situation fully demonstrates the unprecedented development and growth of the anti-violence forces of American blacks, and at the same time, it powerfully shows that the reactionary rule of the American monopoly bourgeoisie is becoming increasingly weak and declining.

On the evening of April 4, after the news of the assassination of black pastor Martin Luther King by American imperialists spread in Washington D.C., the black masses, who have long harbored deep hatred for racial oppression, rushed to the streets. They set fire to the shops of white exploiters, and the flames illuminated the dark sky. The reactionary authorities were terrified and hastily increased the number of guards around the White House, where the American President resides, to protect the lair of the white racial oppressors.

On April 5, although it rained heavily in Washington D.C., the flames of the black struggle burned even more fiercely. Groups of angry blacks, regardless of age or gender, chanted slogans against racial oppression and demanded black power as they surged from the black residential areas to the city center. The shop windows of many white exploiters were smashed to pieces, and there were over a hundred fires throughout the city. In many places, rows of houses burned down to the ground. The brave black masses, undeterred by the savage suppression of the fascist police and military, even set the flames of revenge near the heavily guarded Capitol Building and the White House. The burning houses lit up the sky, and smoke filled the air, making it necessary to drive with headlights on during the day.

The brave black snipers were particularly active. They shot at the reactionary police and military from all directions, wounding dozens of them. These reactionaries, who usually lorded it over the blacks, were now terrified and lost their composure.

Inside the White House, the American imperialist leader Johnson was terrified by this fiery black anti-violence struggle. He weakly exclaimed that Washington D.C. was "in the midst of violence and chaos." This butcher of the Vietnamese people and the chief culprit of the brutal suppression of the American people was so frightened that he couldn't sleep for several nights, his eyes red from lack of sleep, and he paced around the White House like an ant on a hot pan. In a desperate struggle, he revealed his ferocious nature by mobilizing over 13,000 troops, including paratroopers and marines, to carry out large-scale armed suppression. Washington D.C. became like a "military camp," with fully armed soldiers patrolling and standing guard throughout the city. Military vehicles, police cars, and fire trucks roared through the streets all day. Machine guns were set up at the entrance of the Capitol Building, and the White House was surrounded by layers of barricades. Helicopters hovered low over the city, conducting surveillance and monitoring of the blacks. The entire Washington D.C. was in a state of panic.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "This storm of black struggle that has erupted within the United States is a prominent manifestation of the current political and economic crises facing American imperialism." The American blacks, who harbor immense revolutionary power, will persist in their brave struggle and combine with the American workers' movement. Ultimately, they will overthrow the reactionary rule of the American monopoly bourgeoisie and destroy the colonialist and imperialist system, achieving complete liberation.

American blacks are awakening! They are fighting! They are advancing!

American blacks bravely fight, fearing no sacrifice, and fight back against the fascist police and military who cower behind their cars.

    美国黑人吹响美国人民反对垄断资产阶级残暴统治新号角
    黑人斗争风暴震撼美帝老巢华盛顿
    美帝统治中心燃起抗暴烈火表明美国黑人抗暴力量空前发展壮大
    新华社十七日讯　美国黑人四月四日掀起的波澜壮阔的抗暴斗争，象一声惊天动地的霹雳，震撼着美国和全世界。在这场斗争中，日益觉醒的黑人群众发扬英勇顽强、不怕牺牲的大无畏精神，在美帝国主义的心脏华盛顿，大造美国垄断资产阶级反动统治的反，把这个头号帝国主义国家的首都变成一个烟雾弥漫、瓦砾成堆的战场。
    华盛顿有七十多万人口，其中百分之六十六是黑人。由于反动统治集团的严密控制，在过去几年中，它逃脱了大规模黑人抗暴斗争的冲击。然而，今年美国黑人掀起的这场新的抗暴斗争一开始，它就首当其冲地受到沉重打击。这种情况充分表明美国黑人抗暴力量的空前发展壮大，同时也有力地表明美国垄断资产阶级的反动统治日益虚弱、衰落。
    四日晚上，黑人牧师马丁·路德·金被美帝国主义者暗杀的消息在华盛顿传开后，长期对种族压迫怀着满腔仇恨的黑人群众就纷纷涌向街头，放火焚烧白人剥削者的商店，一处处的大火把黑沉沉的天空照得通红。反动当局吓得胆战心惊，慌忙在美国总统居住的白宫周围增加岗哨，保护这个白人种族压迫者的老巢。
    五日，华盛顿虽然下了一场大雨，黑人斗争的烈火却越烧越旺。一群群愤怒的黑人不分男女老少，高呼着反对种族压迫、要求黑人权力的口号，从黑人居住区涌向市中心。许多白人剥削者的商店橱窗被砸得粉碎，全市共一二百处起火。许多地方成排成排的房屋烧成了一片火海。英勇的黑人群众，不顾法西斯军警的野蛮镇压，甚至把复仇的烈火烧到了重兵把守的国会大厦和白宫附近。被烧的房屋火光冲天，烟雾弥漫，汽车在大白天也得开灯才能行驶。
    英勇的黑人狙击手更是异常活跃。他们到处放冷枪射击反动军警，打伤军警七八十人。这些平时骑在黑人头上作威作福的反动家伙，被打得丧魂失魄，威风扫地。
    在白宫里，美帝头子约翰逊被这一场如火如荼的黑人抗暴斗争吓破了胆，他有气无力地惊呼，华盛顿“已处在暴力和骚乱之中”。这个屠杀越南人民的刽子手、残酷镇压美国人民的罪魁祸首，吓得一连几夜睡不着觉，两只眼睛熬得通红，急得象热锅上的蚂蚁在白宫里团团打转。为了进行垂死挣扎，他凶相毕露地调动包括伞兵和海军陆战队在内的一万三千多名军队，进行大规模武装镇压。华盛顿变得象一座“大兵营”一样，全副武装的士兵在全城巡逻放哨。军用车、警车、消防车整天呼啸着在街上奔驰。国会大厦门口架起了机关枪，白宫周围布设了层层封锁线，直升飞机低空盘旋，对黑人进行侦察监视。整个华盛顿陷于一片惊恐之中。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“这场黑人的斗争风暴发生在美国国内，是美帝国主义当前整个政治危机和经济危机的一个突出表现。”蕴藏极大革命力量的美国黑人，坚持英勇斗争，并同美国工人运动相结合，最终必将推翻美国垄断资产阶级反动统治，摧毁殖民主义、帝国主义制度，取得彻底解放。（附图片）
