Since this spring, massive popular movements have been continuously launched, striking a heavy blow to the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries.

Xinhua News Agency reports: With the invincible Mao Zedong Thought spreading widely in Japan, the Japanese revolutionary people's anti-American patriotic just struggle has recently flourished, ushering in a new situation.

Chairman Mao said, "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is a question of first importance in revolution." In their struggles, the Japanese revolutionary people study and apply Chairman Mao's works, deeply understanding the great significance of this teaching.

Since this spring, the Japanese people have launched continuous mass movements. For example, the struggle against the U.S. nuclear aircraft carrier "Enterprise" entering Sasebo Port, the struggle against the construction of a U.S. military airport in Sanrizuka, the struggle against the construction of a new Tokyo U.S. military field hospital, the struggle of farmers in Yamanashi Prefecture against the North Fuji shooting range, the two major strikes by national railway workers, and the strikes by Japanese workers at the U.S. military base in Tachikawa refusing to transport oil and by Japanese workers at the U.S. military depot in Sagamihara refusing to repair weapons. These struggles have clear targets, mutually support each other, are powerful and strong, and have dealt a heavy blow to the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries.

The Miyamoto revisionist clique, in order to serve U.S. imperialism and Japanese monopolies, has been trying to lead the mass movements into mere economic struggles. In the actual struggle, the Japanese revolutionary people have repeatedly purged the influence of Miyamoto's parliamentary and economistic poison, achieving one victory after another.

Chairman Mao said, "The anti-U.S. imperialist line of struggle for national liberation and people's democracy is being increasingly expanded in Japan. This is the most reliable guarantee for the victory of the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle." The Japanese people, who are fighting against U.S. imperialism, pay great attention to expanding the anti-American united front. In Chiba Prefecture's Sanrizuka, local farmers, in their struggle against the construction of the so-called "international airport" by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, have received strong support from all over the country. Workers, students, women, and citizens from all directions have rushed to Sanrizuka to participate in this anti-American struggle, completely surrounding the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries in a vast sea of people. There, as soon as the police and secret agents enter the village, the alarm bells ring, and everyone shouts to drive them away. In the face of the Japanese people's struggle, the construction of the airport cannot proceed, leaving the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries in a state of utter chaos and helplessness.

The Japanese revolutionary people are very brave in their struggles. Whenever they encounter enemy suppression, they read "Resolutely carry out the decision, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory" from Chairman Mao's quotations over and over again, using it to boost morale and strengthen their confidence in victory.

The Sato reactionary government, in order to suppress the Japanese people's anti-American patriotic struggle, has sent large numbers of armed police each time, using batons, tear gas, and armored vehicles to attack the crowds, injuring thousands of people and arbitrarily arresting hundreds of patriots. However, the Japanese revolutionary people are fearless and resolute in their struggles. The more the enemy suppresses, the more people participate in the anti-American struggle, and the more courageous the struggle becomes. These struggles have frightened the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, while the revolutionary people have become stronger through these struggles.

Currently, the Japanese revolutionary people are further studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, launching broader struggles, and striving for new victories.

Japanese revolutionary people holding up Chairman Mao's portrait, arm in arm, shouting slogans, are bravely fighting to strengthen the friendship between the people of China and Japan.

    日本革命人民反美爱国斗争波澜壮阔
    今春以来不断掀起声势浩大的群众运动，斗争目标明确，沉重打击美日反动派
    新华社讯　随着战无不胜的毛泽东思想在日本广泛传播，日本革命人民的反美爱国正义斗争最近蓬勃发展，出现了新的局面。
    毛主席说，“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”日本革命人民在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，深刻地领会了毛主席这一教导的重大意义。
    今春以来，日本人民发动了连续不断的群众运动。如反对美国“企业号”核航空母舰进驻佐世保港的斗争、反对在三里塚修建美军机场的斗争、反对新建东京美军野战医院的斗争、山梨县农民反对北富士打靶场的斗争、国营铁路工人的两次大罢工，以及在美军厚木基地工作的日本工人拒运汽油的罢工和在相模原市美军兵站工作的日本工人拒修武器的罢工等，这些斗争目标明确，彼此相互呼应，声势强大有力，给予美日反动派沉重的打击。
    宫本修正主义集团为了替美帝和日本垄断资本效劳，竭力把群众运动引向单纯的经济斗争。日本革命人民在实际斗争的过程中，不断肃清宫本集团议会主义和经济主义的流毒，取得了一次又一次的胜利。
    毛主席说：“日本各阶层人民反对美帝国主义侵略、压迫和控制的爱国统一战线不断地扩大。这是日本人民反美爱国斗争胜利的最可靠的保证。”向美帝国主义展开斗争的日本人民，非常注意扩大反美统一战线。在千叶县三里塚，当地农民在反对美日反动派修建所谓“国际机场”的斗争中，得到了来自全国各地的有力支援。工人、学生、妇女、市民，从四面八方涌向三里塚，参加这场反美斗争，使美日反动派完全处在人民群众的汪洋大海之中。在那里，只要警察和特务一闯进村，立即警报齐鸣，人人喊打。在日本人民的斗争面前，修建机场的工程根本无法进行，弄得美日反动派狼狈万状、一筹莫展。
    日本革命人民在斗争中非常英勇，每当遇到敌人的镇压，他们总是一遍又一遍地朗读“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”这段毛主席语录，用来鼓舞士气，坚定胜利信心。
    佐藤反动政府为了镇压日本人民的反美爱国斗争，每次都派出大批武装警察，用棍棒、催泪瓦斯、装甲车袭击群众，打伤数以千计的群众，无理逮捕数以百计的爱国者。但是日本革命人民不畏强暴，坚决斗争。敌人越是镇压，参加反美斗争的人数越增多，斗争越英勇。这些斗争吓得美日反动派胆战心惊，而革命人民在这些斗争中锻炼得更加坚强。
    目前，日本革命人民正在进一步活学活用毛主席著作，开展更广泛的斗争，为夺取新的胜利而奋斗。（附图片）
