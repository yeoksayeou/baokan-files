No modern weapons can save the U.S. empire from defeat. Vietnamese military and civilians shoot down another U.S. boasted F-111A aircraft.

	Hanoi, April 1 — According to reports from here, on March 30, the military and civilians of the Vietnamese province of Hoang Xuan shot down one U.S. aggressor F-111A aircraft.

	This is the second F-111A aircraft shot down in Vietnam in three days.

	Hanoi, March 30 — On March 27, the air defense forces of the Vietnamese province of Quang Binh shot down one U.S. F-4 jet aircraft.

	On the same night, the military and civilians of Hai Phong also shot down one U.S. aggressor F-6 aircraft.

	Hanoi, March 30 — On March 30, the Vietnamese newspapers "People's Daily" and "People's Army Daily" published commentaries and editorials, respectively, celebrating the military and civilians of Nghe An province shooting down one U.S. F-111A aircraft on March 28.

	The commentary in "People's Daily" said, the military and civilians of Nghe An province bravely and intelligently shot down one U.S. boasted F-111A aircraft, which is a resounding slap in the face of the U.S. aggressors who worship weapons. This is a powerful response by the Vietnamese military and civilians to the U.S. aggressors' provocations and desperate struggles.

	The commentary pointed out that the U.S. boasted "most modern aircraft," from "Thunderchief," "Phantom," B-52 bombers to F-111A aircraft, have all been shot down by the Vietnamese military and civilians. No matter what modern warfare tools the U.S. aggressors use, they cannot escape the fate of suffering a thorough defeat in Vietnam.

	The editorial in "People's Army Daily" pointed out that at present, the U.S. aggressors, like a heavily wounded beast, are making desperate struggles in a futile attempt to salvage their failing fortunes. All Vietnamese military and civilians are determined to continue to carry forward the spirit of revolutionary offensive, enhance the will to fight to the end, stay alert, and resolutely smash all U.S. aggressors' war "escalation" actions under any circumstances.

    新华社河内一日电　据这里公布，越南北方河西省军民三月三十日又击落美国强盗F—111A型飞机一架。

    《人民报》的评论说，河静省军民勇敢、机智地击落美国大肆吹嘘的F—111A型飞机一架，这是给迷信武器的美国强盗一记十分响亮的耳光。这是越南军民对美国强盗的挑衅和疯狂挣扎的有力回答。
    评论指出，美国吹嘘的“最现代化飞机”，从“雷公”、“鬼怪”、B—52型轰炸机到F—111A型飞机，都被越南军民击落了。美国强盗的任何现代化战争工具，都不能使它摆脱在越南遭到彻底失败的命运。
    《人民军队报》的社论指出，目前，美国强盗象一头受重伤的野兽一样，正在进行垂死挣扎，妄图挽救它失败的命运。全体越南军民决心不断发扬革命进攻精神，增强决战决胜意志，提高警惕，在任何情况下都坚决粉碎美国强盗的一切战争“升级”行动。
