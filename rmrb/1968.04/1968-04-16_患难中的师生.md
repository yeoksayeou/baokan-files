On the morning of the day the earthquake struck, the teacher of the primary school in the village of Dazhou Xian, Saimai Xiding Xixu, was giving a lesson to his students. Thirty children were gazing at him intently. He smiled at them happily and cheerfully, greeted them, and was about to begin his lesson. Just then, there was a sudden loud rumble, and the walls and floor began to shake. Immediately, there was another loud rumble, and bricks and glass came crashing down. Part of the roof collapsed. The children hurried to open the door, but they couldn't get it open.

The teacher fell to the ground by the wall. Forgetting his own pain, he smashed the door open with a bang. He first hugged two children and then, two by two, carried them all out. But the children were too young to understand what an earthquake was. The teacher carried them out through one window, but they crawled back in through another window to get their school bags.

"Quick, get away! I'll bring your things out!" Saimai Xiding Xixu shouted to the children and rushed back into the classroom. He grabbed the students' school bags and notebooks and was about to climb out the window when the ground shook violently again. The floor made a loud noise, and the ceiling and walls collapsed. Bricks and wooden planks struck his waist and face, and blood flowed from his wounds. He fainted for a moment. "Teacher!" The children swarmed over and rescued him. Saimai Xiding slowly came to and, seeing the children safely standing before him, smiled happily.

Not long after, with the collective efforts of all the villagers, a new school building was reconstructed in Dazhou Xian. Under the golden sunlight, Saimai Xiding Xixu and his little friends were living happily together again.

    患难中的师生
    发生地震那天清晨，大奥斯特兰村的小学教员赛迈希丁·希胡正在教室里给学生上课。三十个孩子目不转睛地看着他，他向孩子们愉快地、幸福地微笑，向大家问过好之后，准备讲课了。正在这时，突然“轰”的一声巨响，墙壁地板都颤抖起来了。紧接着又是“轰”的一声，砖瓦、玻璃稀里哗拉地掉在地上，屋顶塌下了一角。孩子们赶忙去开门，但怎么也开不开。
    老师跌倒在墙边，他忘记了疼痛，“啪”的一下子把门砸开，首先抱住两个孩子，然后又一连两个、两个地往外抱，三十个孩子全抱出去了。但是孩子太小，他们哪里知道是什么地震呢？老师把他们从一个窗口抱出去，但他们又从另一个窗口爬到教室里去拿书包。
    “快快躲开，我给你们拿出来！”赛迈希丁·希胡对孩子们说完就跑进了教室，抱起学生们的书包笔记本往外走。刚要上窗台，脚下又一次剧烈地震动起来。地板上一声响，天花板和墙壁全塌下来了。砖头和木块打在他的腰部和脸上，鲜血从伤口流出来，一刹那他昏过去了。“老师！”孩子们一窝蜂地涌上去把老师抢救出来，赛迈希丁慢慢地醒了过来，他一看孩子们安全地站在他的面前，就幸福地微笑了。
    过了不久，在全村居民的集体努力下，一所新的校舍又在大奥斯特兰村重建起来了。在金色的阳光照耀下，赛迈希丁·希胡老师，又跟他的小朋友们愉快地生活在一起了。
