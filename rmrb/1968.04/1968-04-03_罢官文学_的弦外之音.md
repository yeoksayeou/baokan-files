Title: The Subtext of "Dismissal Literature"

A few years ago, during the so-called "season" of "drums in winter" and "spring grass sprouting," a batch of "dismissal literature" that seized on the issue of dismissal to write extensively emerged. Works like "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," "Hai Rui's Memorial to the Throne," "Minister of War Yu Qian," and "Sun An's Memorial" flooded out like snakes from a nest after a heavy rain, one after another, wriggling and twisting their way out. In this whirlwind of evil winds and poisonous mists, some works that originally had nothing to do with dismissal were also forced to "create" a "dismissal" plot, using it to vent their counter-revolutionary "grievances" and "indignation." The reactionary film "Storm" is such a work.

This film is about the "Pingjiang Uprising." It deliberately portrays a leader of the "Pingjiang Uprising," Luo Dacheng. However, this "infallible" and "exceptionally correct" leader is abruptly announced by a special envoy from the Party Central Committee: "I am removing you from all your positions within and outside the Party!" He was dismissed from office.

Searching through the history of Pingjiang, there was never such a character as Luo Dacheng, who was consistently correct and yet was dismissed from office. The peasant movement in the Pingjiang area was initiated by Chairman Mao. The armed peasants in the Pingxiang area were led by Chairman Mao to Jinggangshan. Peng Dehuai, who only arrived in the Pingjiang area in 1928, was originally an executioner suppressing the local peasant movement. After joining the revolutionary ranks, he was an old opportunist who repeatedly committed line errors. The film not only depicts him as "Luo Dacheng" but also "dismisses" him from office. This light stroke connects the "Pingjiang Uprising" of 1928 with the Lushan Conference of 1959. The farewell song in the film not only concentrates the reactionary class's despair and hatred towards Peng Dehuai's dismissal but also openly sings: "I hold the banner and wait for your return," blatantly reflecting the reactionary class's eager desire for Peng Dehuai to "return to office" and lead them to "do a big job."

Why are they so resentful of Peng Dehuai's dismissal and so eager for his return to office? Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating power. And the counter-revolutionaries' desperate struggle against revolutionary forces is also entirely for the purpose of maintaining their power." The answer lies here. The fact that all enemies seize on the issue of dismissal to write extensively not only shows that they want power but also shows that our dismissal of officials has hit their vital points.

Vice Chairman Lin says: The leadership cadre is the power, the state machine. Who participates in such a "cadre" is a matter that concerns the fate of the Party and the state. Our abscesses are the enemies' treasures. Therefore, while doing a good job in ideological transformation, we must take organizational measures to remove the "abscesses." For cadres who have made mistakes, including serious mistakes, as long as they are not incorrigible, we still warmly help them correct their mistakes and still use them. As for those traitors, spies, and a small handful of stubborn capitalists who have infiltrated the Party, we must resolutely remove their positions, revoke their jobs, and criticize them politically, ideologically, and theoretically until they are thoroughly exposed. There must be no hesitation in this!

Films like "Storm" are highly poisonous and must be exposed to the sunlight to eliminate their toxicity. At the same time, they are extremely valuable negative teaching materials. Their most "precious" aspect is that they reveal the class tendencies of the enemy: they desperately want to be "officials." Having "officials" means having "power," and having "power" means having everything. With decades of counter-revolutionary experience, their feelings on this point are too deep, almost to the point of being "cut to the bone."

"Dismissal literature" writes about "dismissal" but aims for "reappointment"; it laments the loss of "power" but seeks to grasp "power." What should we do? We must oppose them head-on: never forget class struggle, never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must firmly grasp the power in the hands of those who are loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

    “罢官文学”的弦外之音
    空军某部　红文
    前几年，在那所谓“腊鼓鸣”“春草生”的“季节”里，一批抓住罢官问题大作文章的“罢官文学”：什么《海瑞罢官》《海瑞上疏》啦，什么《兵部尚书于谦》《孙安动本》啦，一时间，象大雨浸了蛇窝似的，一条跟着一条，鼓腮舞舌弯弯曲曲地爬了出来。在这阵妖风毒雾之中，一些本来同罢官没有瓜葛的作品，作者也要千方百计地“创造”一个“罢官”的情节，借以发泄反革命的“心头之恨”“忿懑之情”。反动影片《怒潮》就是这样一部片子。
    这部片子是写“平江起义”的。其中刻意求工地塑造了一个“平江起义”的领导人罗大成。但是，这个“英明无比”“正确异常”的领导者，却被党中央特派员断然宣布：“我撤掉你党内外一切职务！”罢了官。
    翻遍平江史，压根就没有这样一个领导平江起义的一贯正确而又被罢了官的罗大成式的人物。平江地区的农民运动是毛主席发动起来的，平浏地区的农民武装是毛主席带上井冈山的。一九二八年才来到平江地区的彭德怀，本来是镇压当地农民运动的刽子手。钻进革命队伍后，他又是个屡犯路线错误的老机会主义者。影片不仅把他写成了“罗大成”，而且还“罢了官”。这轻轻一笔，使一九二八年的“平江起义”跟一九五九年的庐山会议挂了钩。影片中的送君歌，不仅集中地发泄了反动阶级对彭德怀被罢官的绝望情绪和仇恨情绪，而且公然唱出了：“我执梭标望君还”这样的句子，露骨地反映了反动阶级盼望彭德怀“复官”回来领着他们“大干一场”的急切的反动心情。
    他们为什么这样怨恨罢掉彭德怀的官，而又这样渴望复彭德怀的官呢？毛主席教导我们说：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”答案就在这里。一切敌人之所以要抓住“罢官”问题大作文章，不仅说明他们要抓权，也说明我们罢的官，结结实实地打中了他们的要害。
    林副主席说：领导班子就是政权，就是国家机器，用什么样的人参加这样的“班子”，是关系到党和国家命运的大事。我们的痈疽，就是敌人的宝贝。因此，在搞好思想革命化的同时，必须采取组织措施，去掉“痈疽”。对待犯有错误，包括犯有严重错误的干部，只要不是死不悔改，我们还是要热情地帮助他们改正错误，还是要用的。至于对那些混进党内的叛徒、特务，以及顽固不化的一小撮走资派，就要坚决罢他的官，撤他的职，并从政治上、思想上、理论上把他们批倒批臭，这是不允许有丝毫的含糊的！
    《怒潮》之类的“罢官文学”有剧毒，因此必须曝晒于光天化日之下，大消其毒。同时它们又是极有价值的反面教材。其最“可贵”之处，就在于它透露了敌人的阶级动向：它们极端渴望做“官”，有“官”则有“权”，有“权”则有一切。集几十年反革命之经验，他们对这一点的感受是太深了，简直可以说是有“切肤”之感的。
    “罢官文学”写的是“罢官”，为的是“复官”；诉的是失“权”，要的是掌“权”。我们怎么办呢？针锋相对：千万不要忘记阶级斗争，千万不要忘记无产阶级专政。一定要把政权牢牢掌握在忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的革命路线的人的手中。
