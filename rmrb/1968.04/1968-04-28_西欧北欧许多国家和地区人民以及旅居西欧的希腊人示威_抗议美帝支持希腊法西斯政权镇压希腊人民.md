People in many countries and regions of Western and Northern Europe, as well as Greeks residing in Western Europe, held demonstrations on April 21st to protest against the Greek fascist military regime's brutal suppression of the Greek people with the support of U.S. imperialism.

In the Swedish capital Stockholm, 2,000 people held a protest rally in the central park. After the rally, the demonstrators marched through Stockholm's main streets in a grand procession. Their placards read: "U.S. imperialism is the enemy of all peoples," "Johnson is a murderer," and "U.S. imperialism out of Greece!" Along the way, the demonstrators also distributed leaflets condemning U.S. imperialism's military intervention in Greece and its support for the Greek fascist military regime.

In the Danish capital, 500 Danish youths and Greeks residing in Denmark held a demonstration in front of the Greek embassy. Some demonstrators later went to the U.S. embassy to protest against U.S. imperialism's support for the Greek reactionary military regime and its aggression in Vietnam.

In West Berlin, more than 2,000 young demonstrators shouted slogans against U.S. imperialism and the Greek military regime, and went to the Greek military delegation and the U.S. cultural center in West Berlin to express their protest. The youths also performed short skits on the streets exposing and condemning U.S. imperialism's backing of the Greek reactionary military regime.

In London, Britain, Hamburg and Munich in West Germany, Rome and Naples in Italy, Vienna in Austria, and many other cities in Western Europe, similar demonstrations were also held.

The current fascist military regime ruling Greece came to power with U.S. support after a military coup on April 21st last year. Over the past year, this regime has been ruthlessly suppressing democratic forces within the country, blatantly aligning itself with U.S. imperialism, and implementing fascist rule.

    西欧北欧许多国家和地区人民以及旅居西欧的希腊人示威
    抗议美帝支持希腊法西斯政权镇压希腊人民
    新华社讯　西欧、北欧许多国家和地区的人民和旅居西欧的希腊人二十一日纷纷举行示威，抗议希腊法西斯军人政权在美帝国主义支持下残暴镇压希腊人民。
    在瑞典首都斯德哥尔摩，两千人在中央公园举行抗议集会。会后，示威者浩浩荡荡通过斯德哥尔摩的主要大街，举行了游行。他们举着的标语牌上写着：“美帝国主义是各国人民的敌人”，“约翰逊是杀人犯”，“美帝滚出希腊”！示威者一路还散发传单，谴责美帝国主义在希腊进行军事干涉和支持希腊法西斯军人政权的统治。
    五百名丹麦青年和旅居丹麦的希腊人在丹麦首都的希腊大使馆前举行示威。有些示威者后来又到美国大使馆去，抗议美帝国主义支持希腊反动军人政权和在越南进行侵略战争。
    在西柏林，两千多名青年示威者高呼反对美帝国主义和希腊军人政权的口号，到西柏林的希腊军事代表团和美国文化中心去表示抗议。青年们还在街上演出了揭露和谴责美帝国主义者扶植希腊反动军人政权的短剧。
    在英国伦敦，西德的汉堡、慕尼黑，意大利的罗马、那不勒斯和奥地利的维也纳等其他许多西欧城市，也都举行了类似的示威。
    目前统治希腊的法西斯军人政权，是在美国支持下于去年四月二十一日发动军事政变后上台的。一年来，这个政权在国内大肆镇压民主力量，赤裸裸地投靠美帝国主义，实行法西斯统治。
