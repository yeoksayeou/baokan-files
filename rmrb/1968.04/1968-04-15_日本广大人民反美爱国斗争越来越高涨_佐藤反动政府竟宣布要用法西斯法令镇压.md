The Japanese reactionary government of Sato announced on the 11th that it would use the fascist law of Article 106 of the Criminal Code, known as the "disturbance" law, to suppress the increasingly intense anti-American patriotic struggle of the broad masses of the Japanese people.

The so-called "disturbance" law was a tool used by the fascist police before the war to brutally suppress the struggles of workers and peasants. After the war, in 1952, the Japanese reactionaries used it to suppress the anti-American patriotic struggle of the Japanese masses on May 1st.

This fascist law stipulates that those who engage in so-called "riotous assembly or threats" will be brutally suppressed and imprisoned for long periods, and supporters will also be persecuted. The Sato reactionary government has already indicated that it will use the method of "mass arrests" to viciously challenge the masses engaged in the anti-American patriotic struggle.

    日本广大人民反美爱国斗争越来越高涨
     佐藤反动政府竟宣布要用法西斯法令镇压
    日本佐藤反动政府十一日悍然宣布，决定起用刑法第一○六条所谓“骚扰罪”的法西斯法令，来镇压日本广大人民群众越来越高涨的反美爱国斗争。
    所谓“骚扰罪”的法令，是战前日本法西斯警察残暴镇压工人、农民斗争的手段。战后于一九五二年“五一”节时日本反动派曾用来镇压反美爱国斗争的日本群众。
    这个法西斯法令规定，对所谓“聚众暴行或威胁者”，进行残暴镇压和长期监禁，对支持者也要迫害。佐藤反动政府已经表明要用“全员逮捕”的办法，来凶恶地向反美爱国斗争的群众挑战。
