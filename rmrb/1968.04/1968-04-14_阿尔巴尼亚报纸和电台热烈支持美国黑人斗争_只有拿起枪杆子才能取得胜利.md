Albanian newspapers and radio stations recently published articles and commentaries enthusiastically praising the courageous struggle of American blacks against violence. They emphasized that American blacks can only achieve their rights and victory by taking up arms.

The article published by the Albanian newspaper "Luftëtari" on the 11th stated that the struggle of American blacks for their rights is an integral part of the struggle of the American people against the exploitative and oppressive policies of the Johnson administration. The determination and bravery shown by the black masses in this struggle demonstrate their heightened awareness and their strengthened belief that only revolutionary violence can defeat the counter-revolutionary violence of the racists, and only through struggle can they win victory.

The article said that the black struggle, which erupted after the U.S. imperialists suffered heavy political and military defeats in the Vietnam War and faced a serious financial crisis at home, is another powerful blow to the disintegrating and crumbling monopoly capitalist system.

The commentary by the Radio Tirana exposed that the organized suppression and persecution of American blacks by the American ruling class is a necessary result of the U.S. government's stubborn pursuit of savage fascist policies. The commentary pointed out that the brutal suppression of blacks by the American reactionaries further exposed the savagery and rottenness of the American capitalist system, while also indicating the difficulties faced by the American reactionaries both domestically and internationally.

    阿尔巴尼亚报纸和电台热烈支持美国黑人斗争
    只有拿起枪杆子才能取得胜利
    新华社地拉那十三日电　阿尔巴尼亚《战士报》和地拉那电台最近分别发表文章和评论，热烈欢呼美国黑人进行的英勇的抗暴斗争，并且指出了美国黑人只有拿起枪杆子才能取得自己的权利和胜利。
      《战士报》十一日发表的文章指出，美国黑人争取自己权利的斗争是美国人民反对约翰逊政府的剥削和奴役政策的斗争的组成部分。黑人群众在这场斗争中所表现出来的决心和勇气，表明了黑人觉悟的提高，表明他们增强了这样的信念，即只有用革命的暴力才能击败种族主义者的反革命暴力，只有通过斗争，才能赢得胜利。
    文章说，在美帝国主义者在侵越战争中遭到政治和军事的惨重失败，国内出现严重的财政危机以后爆发的黑人斗争，是对日益支离破碎和走向全面崩溃的垄断资本主义制度的又一个强有力的打击。
    地拉那电台的评论揭露说，美国统治阶级对美国黑人的有组织的镇压和迫害，是美国政府顽固推行野蛮的法西斯政策的必然结果。评论指出，美国反动派对黑人的残酷镇压，更进一步暴露了美国资本主义社会制度的野蛮性及其腐朽性，同时也表明了美国反动派在国内外所处的困境。
