The Revolutionary Committee of Shandong Paper Mill East Plant is focusing on a fundamental matter under the socialist system: insisting on participating in collective production labor with the workers. The committee members, in the guise of ordinary laborers, are active in the workshops and teams, strengthening their ties with the masses, and better fulfilling their leadership roles in promoting revolution and production.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, April 8: The members of the Revolutionary Committee of Shandong Paper Mill East Plant insist on participating in production labor with the workers, strengthening their ties with the masses, promoting revolution, and advancing production. They have received praise from the broad revolutionary staff.

Last October, after the establishment of the revolutionary committee of the factory, a new phase of class struggle began. Class enemies changed their tactics, using sugar-coated bullets to attack the members of the revolutionary committee. Some disguised themselves as "protectors" of the revolutionary committee, telling some worker-commissioners: "You are all workers, never having left labor, now that you are officials, work is busy, and there are many things to do, you should focus on the office work, participating in labor or not doesn't matter much." Some members of the revolutionary committee, because of the "private" thoughts in their minds, heard these flattering words and felt quite comfortable, resulting in relaxing their participation in production labor. These phenomena alerted many comrades in the revolutionary committee. They immediately convened an expanded meeting of the revolutionary committee, studied Chairman Mao's relevant teachings, and listened to the opinions of the revolutionary masses. Chairman Mao said: "Our party and state cadres are ordinary laborers, not lords riding on the heads of the people. Cadres, through participating in collective production labor, maintain the broadest, most frequent, and closest contact with the laboring people. This is a fundamental matter under the socialist system, which helps to overcome bureaucratism, prevent revisionism and dogmatism." The revolutionary masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought said: "Have you thought about it? Who wouldn't want the members of the revolutionary committee to leave labor and the masses? It is those untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and the stubborn walking capitalists. You must not be fooled!" Chairman Mao's wise teachings greatly educated the members of the revolutionary committee, and the serious words of class brothers deepened their understanding of Chairman Mao's teachings. Thus, they fiercely struggled against the "private" thoughts, swept away the influence of old ideas, smashed the sugar-coated bullets of the class enemies, and specially made a decision for the members of the revolutionary committee to participate in production labor. Since then, for more than five months, the members of the revolutionary committee have all been active in the workshops and teams as ordinary laborers.

Shandong Paper Mill East Plant is a factory with more than 1,500 people. How do the members of the factory revolutionary committee do their work while spending so much time in the workshops and teams participating in production labor? The comrades of the revolutionary committee replied that participating in labor and doing a good job are not contradictory, and only by participating in labor, getting close to the masses, and contacting reality can one better realize leadership.

The members of the factory revolutionary committee, following Chairman Mao's teachings of "never forgetting class struggle" and "political work is the lifeline of all economic work," when participating in production labor in the workshops and teams, first help the workshops and teams to set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes, organize the broad revolutionary masses to continuously and unceasingly expose, denounce, and criticize the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, the revisionist line of running enterprises, and the revisionist line of building the party, further raising the class consciousness and line struggle consciousness of the revolutionary staff.

The members of the factory revolutionary committee and the broad masses participate in collective production labor, understand the dynamic thoughts of the masses, discover problems in the work, and also have ways to solve the problems. Recently, this factory has a large number of pulp boards scattered in the yard, which need to be stacked in time. Otherwise, once it rains, the pulp boards will turn yellow and black, causing great losses to the state. The members of the factory revolutionary committee gave up their Sunday rest and joined the workers of the transportation team to engage in transportation work. However, the number of pulp boards is too large, and the transportation progress is slow. If it continues like this, it will take at least two months to stack them. What to do? The members of the factory revolutionary committee participating here, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "the masses are the real heroes," mobilized the workers to carry out technological innovation. They and the workers, after two days and nights of hard work, made a soil stacking machine, increasing work efficiency by tens of times, and completed the stacking task in just eight days. In the past, when workers proposed a rationalization suggestion, it had to go through five levels of examination and approval. Now, the members of the revolutionary committee and the workers work together in the workshop to carry out technological innovation. The workers proposed rationalization suggestions, and they did it immediately, seeing the results right away. The main production equipment of this factory, the paper-making machine, has always relied on national allocation. Since the Cultural Revolution, many workers have taken the initiative to design, manufacture, and install it themselves. The revolutionary committee firmly supports the revolutionary spirit of the workers. The members of the revolutionary committee also participate in the trial production with the workers. According to the routine, it takes two to three years to manufacture a paper-making machine; this time, it only took seven months to successively manufacture two paper-making machines, strongly promoting the development of production.

    山东造纸总厂东厂革委会狠抓社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事
    坚持和工人一起参加集体生产劳动
    革委会成员以普通劳动者的姿态活跃在车间班组，密切了同群众的联系，在抓革命促生产中更好地发挥了领导作用
    据新华社济南八日电　山东造纸总厂东厂革命委员会的成员，坚持和工人一起参加生产劳动，密切了与群众的联系，抓好了革命，促进了生产，受到了广大革命职工的称赞。
    去年十月，这个厂革委会成立后，一场在新的条件下的阶级斗争开始了。阶级敌人变换了手法，用糖衣裹着的炮弹向革命委员会的同志发动进攻。他们有的装扮成“爱护”革委会的样子，对一些工人出身的委员说：“你们都是工人，从来没脱离过劳动，现在当了干部，工作忙，事情多，得好好抓抓办公室的工作了，参加不参加劳动关系不大。”革委会有的成员因为头脑里的“私”字作怪，听了这些捧场的话，觉得挺舒服，结果就放松了参加生产劳动。这些现象引起了革委会许多同志的警惕。他们立即召开革委会扩大会议，学习毛主席的有关教导，听取革命群众的意见。毛主席说：“我们党和国家的干部是普通劳动者，而不是骑在人民头上的老爷。干部通过参加集体生产劳动，同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系。这是社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事，它有助于克服官僚主义，防止修正主义和教条主义。”用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命群众说：“想过没有，谁巴不得革委会委员脱离劳动，脱离群众？就是那些没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子和顽固不化的走资派。你们可千万别上当啊！”毛主席的英明教导，极大的教育了革委会的成员，阶级兄弟的语重心长的话，又使他们对毛主席的教导加深了理解。于是，他们狠斗“私”字，肃清旧思想的影响，粉碎阶级敌人糖衣炮弹的进攻，专门作出了革委会成员参加生产劳动的决定。从那时以来的五个多月中，革委会的成员人人都是活跃在车间班组的普通劳动者。
      山东造纸总厂东厂是一个拥有一千五百多人的工厂，厂革委会成员用那样多的时间到车间班组参加生产劳动，怎样做好领导工作呢？革委会的同志回答说，参加劳动和做好工作并不矛盾，而且只有参加劳动，深入群众，接触实际，才能更好地实现领导。
    厂革委会成员遵照毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”和“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导，到车间班组参加生产劳动时，首先帮助车间班组开办毛泽东思想学习班，组织广大革命群众，对资产阶级反动路线、修正主义办企业路线以及修正主义建党路线，连续不断地进行大揭发、大控诉、大批判，进一步提高了革命职工的阶级觉悟和路线斗争觉悟。
    厂革委会成员和广大群众一起参加集体生产劳动，了解了群众的活思想，发现了工作中的问题，也有了解决问题的办法。最近，这个厂有一大批纸浆版，散放在货场上，需要及时垛好。不然，下雨一淋，纸浆版就会变黄变黑，给国家造成很大损失。厂革委会成员放弃了星期天休息，和搬运队的工人们一道投入了搬运工作。但是，纸浆版的数量太大，搬运进度很慢，这样下去至少得两个月才能垛好。怎么办呢？在这里参加劳动的厂革委会委员遵照毛主席“群众是真正的英雄”的教导，发动工人搞技术革新。他们和工人一道，经过两天一夜的奋战，制成一部土堆垛机，工效提高了数十倍，仅用八天时间就完成了堆垛任务。过去，工人提一个合理化建议，要经五道关卡审查批准。现在，革委会成员和工人一块在车间搞技术革新，工人们提出了合理化建议，说干就干，立竿见影。这个厂的主要生产设备抄纸机，一向依靠国家调拨，文化大革命以来，许多工人积极行动起来，自己设计、自己制造、自己安装。厂革委会坚决支持工人们的革命精神，革委会成员并且和工人一道参加试制。按照常规，制造一台抄纸机需要两、三年时间；这次，仅用了七个月就先后制成了两台抄纸机，有力地促进了生产的发展。
