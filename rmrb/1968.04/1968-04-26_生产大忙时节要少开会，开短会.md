Recently, we have encountered a pressing issue: the number of meetings is too high, and they last too long.

Our commune has 23 cadres. According to statistics from March, excluding two who handle daily work in the commune, the remaining 21 cadres spend most of their time attending meetings. They either go to the county or city for meetings or attend meetings within the commune. The actual time spent working in the villages only accounts for 32.2% of the total working days. Some meetings held by the city, county, and commune have a large number of participants. Not only do commune cadres attend, but also brigade cadres. Some broadcast meetings require all personnel to stop production and attend. The duration of these meetings is also long, usually lasting four to five days, seven to eight days, and some even last eleven days. After returning to the commune, further discussions and meetings are needed to implement the decisions, so a single meeting can take up seven to eight days, or even half a month.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The most fundamental aspect of reforming state organs is to connect with the masses." Because cadres spend most of their working time in meetings, this reduces their opportunities to connect with the masses.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary masses have strong opinions about this phenomenon, especially about stopping production to attend meetings. They believe that this not only affects the revolution and production but also does not align with the spirit of thrift and revolution.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "At present, during the spring plowing season, I hope that all leading comrades, workers, and people in the liberated areas will seize the opportunity to grasp the production links and achieve greater results than last year." Chairman Mao also teaches us: "Every place must cherish manpower and material resources very much. On the one hand, do not waste them recklessly, and on the other hand, strive to develop production." Therefore, we suggest that during the peak spring plowing season, the number of meetings should be reduced, and the duration of meetings should be shortened. Especially for higher-level leading organs, they should create conditions for lower levels. Meetings that can be postponed should be postponed, and those that can be combined should not be held separately. The number of meeting participants should be minimized, and the time should be shortened as much as possible. Especially, do not easily stop production for meetings, and broadcast meetings should be held in the evening as much as possible.

### 生产大忙时节要少开会，开短会

    生产大忙时节要少开会，开短会
    最近，我们这里存在一个急待解决的问题：这就是会议太多、开会时间太长。
    我们公社机关共有二十三个干部。据三月份的统计，除两名在机关处理日常工作以外，其余二十一名干部，大部分时间都用于开会，不是去县、市开会，就是在公社开会。实际下乡工作的时间，只占全部工作日的百分之三十二点二。市、县、公社召开的有些会议，参加的人数很多，不仅公社干部参加，还要大队干部参加。有些广播大会，还要全部人员停止生产参加。会议时间也长，一般的四五天、七八天，多的一次会议开十一天。加上回公社以后要研究，要开会贯彻，因此一次会就得七八天，甚至半个月。
    毛主席教导我们说：“国家机关的改革，最根本的一条，就是联系群众。”由于干部的工作时间大部分被会议占去，这就减少了他们联系群众的机会。
    广大贫下中农和革命群众，对这种现象，特别是停产开会，是很有意见的。他们认为，这既影响抓革命促生产，也不符合节约闹革命的精神。
    毛主席教导我们说：“目前正当春耕时节，希望一切解放区的领导同志、工作人员、人民群众，不失时机地掌握生产环节，取得比去年更大的成绩。”毛主席还教导我们：“任何地方必须十分爱惜人力物力，……一面决不滥用浪费，一面努力发展生产。”因此，我们建议：在春耕大忙季节，要减少会议，缩短会议的时间，特别是上级领导机关，要为下级创造条件，能推迟召开的会议，就推迟召开，能合并召开的，就不单独开。开会人员要尽量减少，时间要尽量缩短。特别不要轻易停产开会，广播大会尽量放在晚间。
