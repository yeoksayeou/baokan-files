The Changli County Revolutionary Committee organized a group of military personnel and county-level cadre members to form a Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team. They went deep into the countryside to propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions, mobilizing the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to carry out revolutionary criticism, seize class struggle, and actively attack the class enemy.

Since the establishment of the county revolutionary committee in November last year, Changli County has been facing sharp and complex class struggles. Class enemies have been using every means to incite the masses to fight each other, attack and frame revolutionary cadres at the commune and brigade levels, and stir up some masses to engage in private sideline production and cause disputes over brigade divisions. This has prevented Chairman Mao's latest instructions from being fully implemented in some communes and brigades.

After the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team went down to the countryside, they held Mao Zedong Thought study classes to teach the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants about Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle. They mobilized the poor and lower-middle peasants to recall bitterness and sweetness, and expose the sabotage activities of class enemies. The entire county quickly launched a wave of exposing, criticizing, and struggling against class enemies. They criticized the various fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev from above, and exposed the evil activities of local, rich, counter-revolutionary, bad, and rightist elements from below. They seized typical cases, shot live targets, and held dozens of mass meetings to strike at class enemies in 39 communes and one town. They smashed the various plots of class enemies, educated the broad revolutionary masses and cadres, and removed obstacles for the implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team in Changli County has been helping the grassroots revolutionary cadres and commune members to seize revolutionary criticism from the beginning. For example, class enemies spread fallacies such as "to get rich, catch fish and shrimp," attempting to lead the masses down the capitalist road. In response to this situation, the propaganda team started from class education, mobilizing the masses to connect with the facts of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in this region, and widely carried out revolutionary criticism. They fiercely criticized the fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev's "three freedoms and one contract." The broad masses of commune members held special criticism meetings, field criticism meetings, and courtyard criticism meetings, wrote big-character posters, and launched fierce attacks on the Chinese Khrushchev.

Through revolutionary criticism, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have a deeper love for Chairman Mao and socialism, and a deeper hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev and capitalism. In the West New Village Brigade of Tianzhuang Commune, some commune members were influenced by the Chinese Khrushchev's "three freedoms and one contract" revisionist fallacies and the incitement of class enemies. For a period of time, they were eager to engage in "small freedoms" and rarely participated in collective production labor. After this round of revolutionary criticism, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants raised their class consciousness. These commune members also angrily said, "The Chinese Khrushchev's 'three freedoms and one contract' is poison. We will no longer be fooled by the class enemies."

"Class struggle, once seized, is effective." The Changli County Revolutionary Committee mobilized the broad revolutionary masses to seize class struggle, bringing about significant changes in the revolutionary and production situation in the entire county. Now, 40 communes under this county have established revolutionary committees. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and grassroots cadres are full of spirit and enthusiasm, determined to take Dazhai as an example, to make this year's revolution and production even better, and to carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end.

    昌黎县革委会发动贫下中农向敌人主动进攻
    大揭本地阶级斗争的盖子
    狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的谬论
    本报讯　河北省昌黎县革命委员会组织一批解放军支左人员和县直属机关的干部，组成毛泽东思想宣传队，深入农村，宣传毛主席的一系列最新指示，发动广大贫下中农开展革命大批判，狠抓阶级斗争，向阶级敌人主动进攻。
    昌黎县从去年十一月成立县革命委员会以来，一直存在着尖锐复杂的阶级斗争。阶级敌人千方百计挑动群众斗群众，打击陷害社、队革命干部，煽动部分群众搞私人副业，闹分队纠纷等，使毛主席一系列最新指示在一些社、队不能全面落实。
    县革委会组织的毛泽东思想宣传队下去以后，通过举办毛泽东思想学习班，向广大贫下中农大讲毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导，发动贫下中农忆苦思甜，大揭阶级敌人的破坏活动。全县迅速掀起了对阶级敌人大揭发、大批判、大斗争的热潮。他们上批中国赫鲁晓夫的种种谬论，下揭地、富、反、坏、右的罪恶活动，抓典型，打活靶，三十九个公社一个镇，召开了几十次打击阶级敌人的群众大会，粉碎了阶级敌人的各种阴谋，教育了广大革命群众和干部，为落实毛主席的最新指示扫除了障碍。
    昌黎县的毛泽东思想宣传队，自始至终帮助基层革命干部和社员群众狠抓革命大批判。例如，阶级敌人散布什么“要想发家，打鱼捞虾”等谬论，妄图把群众引向资本主义邪路上去。针对这种情况，宣传队从阶级教育入手，发动群众联系本地区两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的事实，广泛开展革命的大批判，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“三自一包”等谬论。广大社员群众开专题批判会、地头批判会、院户批判会，写大字报，向中国赫鲁晓夫猛烈开火。
    通过革命的大批判，广大贫下中农对毛主席和社会主义更加热爱，对中国赫鲁晓夫和资本主义更加痛恨。田上庄公社西新立庄大队部分社员，受中国赫鲁晓夫“三自一包”修正主义谬论的影响和阶级敌人的煽动，在一段时间内热中于搞“小自由”，很少参加集体生产劳动。经过这次革命大批判，广大贫下中农提高了阶级觉悟，这些社员也愤怒地说：“中国赫鲁晓夫的‘三自一包’是毒药，我们再也不上阶级敌人的当了。”
      “阶级斗争，一抓就灵。”昌黎县革命委员会发动广大革命群众狠抓阶级斗争，使全县革命和生产面貌发生了很大的变化。现在，这个县所属四十个公社已经建立了革命委员会。广大贫下中农和基层干部意气风发，干劲十足，决心以大寨为榜样，把今年的革命和生产搞得好上加好，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
