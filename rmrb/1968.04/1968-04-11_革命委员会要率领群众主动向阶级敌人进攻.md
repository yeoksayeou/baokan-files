The editorial in today's *People's Daily* and *PLA Daily* conveyed the latest instructions from our great leader Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions deeply and profoundly elucidate the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the content of class struggle, pointing the way for us to continue class struggle under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions shine with resplendent light. We must study them earnestly, grasp their essence deeply, and implement them with the greatest speed and determination.

As our great teacher Chairman Mao has taught us, the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a continuation of the long-term struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and the revolutionary masses it leads and the reactionary Kuomintang. It is a continuation of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. The reality of class struggle at Xizhimen Station fully proves this.

Under the protection and encouragement of a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have not been reformed at our station are trying to restore capitalism every day and attempt to turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. For example, there is a historical counter-revolutionary who once killed our underground party members and revolutionary cadres. During the Cultural Revolution, he spread rumors and stirred up trouble everywhere, sabotaging the Cultural Revolution. He brazenly beat two revolutionary cadres and boasted, "I beat you!" Another historical counter-revolutionary even infiltrated a revolutionary mass organization during the Cultural Revolution, using the banner of "rebellion" to "seize power." After the revolutionary committee was established, they openly directed their arrows at the revolutionary power organs and even went to the mass dictatorship groups to demand a reversal of their cases, refusing to admit they were counter-revolutionaries. The living facts of class struggle have taught us: if the proletariat does not exercise dictatorship over class enemies, they will seize power from the proletariat. The more the situation improves, the more we are on the verge of winning a complete victory in the Cultural Revolution, the sharper and more complex the class struggle becomes, and the more class enemies will make desperate struggles.

Since the establishment of the revolutionary committee, we have followed the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "never forget class struggle," and have vigorously grasped class struggle. We have educated the broad masses of workers on class struggle and line struggle, and mobilized revolutionary workers to launch a fierce attack on class enemies. Once the masses were mobilized, they immediately exercised dictatorship over class enemies, handing over two counter-revolutionaries to the dictatorship organs, greatly boosting the morale of the revolutionary masses and striking a heavy blow to the arrogance of class enemies, further consolidating the revolutionary power organs.

From the practice of class struggle, we deeply feel that: to make the revolutionary power truly become the revolutionary command center leading the masses to fight against class enemies, we must always remember class struggle, always remember the dictatorship of the proletariat, always remember to emphasize politics, and always remember to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. If we forget to grasp class struggle and forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, the power we have obtained will still be in danger of being seized by the bourgeoisie.

Currently, a right-wing wind of reversing cases is blowing in society, and class enemies are openly directing their arrows at our proletarian command center and the newly born revolutionary committees. This is a manifestation of the class enemies' desperate struggles. We must not relax our fighting will in the slightest. We must strengthen our awareness of class struggle and line struggle, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, continue to mobilize the masses to carry out a great criticism, and resolutely oppose right-wing conservatism, right-wing splittism, and right-wing capitulationism, fully implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

The revolutionary workers of Hunan Provincial State-owned Xuguang Electronic Tube Factory warmly acclaim the publication of Chairman Mao's latest instructions in the editorial "The Sun Rises Over the Land of China" in the *People's Daily* and *PLA Daily*. They are determined to study this great instruction earnestly, strengthen their awareness of the enemy, and never forget the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. They will resolutely continue to attack the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev, and their agents in Hunan, and strive to win a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    革命委员会要率领群众主动向阶级敌人进攻
    北京西直门车站革命委员会
    四月十日《人民日报》《解放军报》社论传达了我们伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示。毛主席的这一光辉指示，最深刻、最精辟地阐明了无产阶级文化大革命的伟大意义和阶级斗争内容，为我们在无产阶级专政条件下，继续进行阶级斗争指明了方向。毛主席的这一光辉指示闪耀着灿烂的光辉。我们一定要认真学习，深刻领会，用最快的速度，下最大的决心，全面贯彻执行。
    正如伟大导师毛主席教导我们的，史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，是中国共产党及其领导下的广大革命人民群众和国民党反动派长期斗争的继续，是无产阶级和资产阶级阶级斗争的继续。西直门车站阶级斗争的现实完全证明了这一点。
    我们车站在党内一小撮走资派的包庇和纵容下，没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子天天想复辟资本主义，妄图变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政。如有一个历史反革命分子，曾杀害过我们地下党员和革命干部，在文化大革命运动中，到处煽阴风，点鬼火，破坏文化大革命。他肆无忌惮地殴打了两名革命干部，并嚣张地说：“打的就是你们”。还有一个历史反革命分子，在文化大革命中竟然混入革命群众组织，打着“造反”的旗号起来“夺权”。革命委员会成立之后，他们还公开把矛头指向革命权力机构，甚至找群众专政小组公开要求翻案，不承认是反革命分子。活生生的阶级斗争的事实教育了我们：无产阶级不对阶级敌人专政，他们就要专无产阶级的政。越是在大好形势下，越是在夺取文化大革命全面胜利的时候，阶级斗争越尖锐、复杂，阶级敌人越要作垂死的挣扎。
    革命委员会成立以来，我们遵照伟大领袖毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，狠抓阶级斗争，对广大职工进行了阶级斗争和路线斗争的教育，并发动革命职工主动地向阶级敌人发起了猛烈进攻。群众发动起来以后，立即向阶级敌人进行专政，把两名反革命分子扭送到专政机关，大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，大灭了阶级敌人的威风，进一步巩固了革命权力机构。
    从阶级斗争的实践中，我们深深体会到：要使革命政权真正成为率领群众向阶级敌人作斗争的革命司令部，就要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。如果忘了抓阶级斗争，忘了无产阶级专政，我们得到的权力还会有被资产阶级夺去的危险。
    当前社会上出现了一股右倾翻案的妖风，阶级敌人公开把矛头对准我们无产阶级司令部和新生的革命委员会。这是阶级敌人最后挣扎的表现。我们决不能稍微松懈自己的战斗意志，一定要加强阶级斗争和路线斗争的观念，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，继续发动群众开展革命的大批判，坚定地反对右倾保守主义、右倾分裂主义和右倾投降主义，全面落实毛主席的最新指示。（附图片）
