The Albanian people warmly hail Chairman Mao's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence. They point out that Chairman Mao's statement is not only a great encouragement and inspiration to American blacks but also to all the people of the world. It makes them more closely united and more resolutely fight against their common enemy, American imperialism.

The secretary of the Albania-America People's Friendship and Solidarity Committee, Kota, told a Xinhua News Agency correspondent that Chairman Mao Zedong's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence has great historical significance. Comrade Mao Zedong, as a great revolutionary and outstanding Marxist-Leninist, has shown American blacks and the entire working class the revolutionary road to complete liberation from the savage exploitation of capitalism and the shackles of imperialism.

Kota said that the Albania-America People's Friendship and Solidarity Committee enthusiastically hails this statement and regards it as a new encouragement and great inspiration for the struggle of American blacks, the American working class, and the revolutionary people of the world against American imperialism. Chairman Mao Zedong calls on the people of all countries to "take action and give strong support to the struggle of American blacks!" Revolutionary people will respond to this call by strengthening their struggle against American imperialism.

Kota pointed out that Comrade Mao Zedong's statement is also a great encouragement to the struggle of the people of all countries against modern revisionism headed by the Soviet revisionist leadership, the chief accomplice of American imperialism.

Kota finally said that Chairman Mao Zedong's statement expresses the strong support and fighting solidarity of the 700 million people of China and the Communist Party of China for the struggle of American blacks against American imperialism. This once again proves the correct position of the People's Republic of China and her role in the world today. She provides reliable and brotherly support to the people of all countries who are fighting for national liberation.

The secretary of the Tirana City Trade Union, Lato, said that Chairman Mao Zedong's statement has great historical significance for all workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals who want to fight against American imperialism and strengthen support for the struggle of American blacks. He said that the working class and all the working people of Tirana City warmly hail this statement and regard it as an outstanding contribution of the people and the Communist Party of China to the struggle of the people of all countries for liberation and against their common enemy, American imperialism.

The advanced worker of the Tirana Stalin Textile Factory, Mechaj, said, "We workers warmly hail Chairman Mao's statement and resolutely support the heroic struggle of American blacks against violence. We see in Chairman Mao's statement the proletarian support of the people and the Communist Party of China for the struggle of American blacks. This statement, issued at this moment, has great significance. It not only mobilizes and inspires American blacks and the entire American people to rise up against the savage oppression of the American reactionaries but also inspires the people of other capitalist countries to overthrow the reactionary rule of the bourgeoisie.

The secretary of the "New China" Agricultural Cooperative Party Branch in the Tirana District, Bekiraj, said, "We members of the 'New China' Agricultural Cooperative, after reading Chairman Mao Zedong's statement supporting the struggle of American blacks against violence, unanimously agree with and support this statement, and at the same time, we are extremely indignant at the long-term policy of savage racial discrimination and oppression against blacks by American imperialism. We believe that the just struggle of blacks will be victorious." Bekiraj emphasized that Chairman Mao's call to the people of the world to support the just struggle of American blacks has received the warm support of the people of all countries.

The legal worker Balanca said that Chairman Mao Zedong's statement has caused a great reaction among all the working masses in Albania. This statement not only expresses the enthusiastic support of the 700 million people of China for the struggle of American blacks but also provides a profound and scientific Marxist-Leninist analysis of their struggle, which is a great encouragement and inspiration for their struggle for final victory. He said that American racial discrimination is a shameful product of colonialism and imperialism. As Chairman Mao pointed out in the statement, only by destroying the system of colonialism and imperialism can blacks achieve liberation.

The engineering student Gurcoj of Tirana University said that the statement by the great Marxist-Leninist and closest friend of the Albanian people, Chairman Mao, is not only a great encouragement and inspiration to American blacks and the American working class but also to all revolutionary forces in the world who are engaged in a life-and-death struggle against American imperialism and its lackeys. He said that Chairman Mao's profound Marxist-Leninist analysis of the world revolutionary situation in the statement is also a powerful weapon for all revolutionaries against the Soviet revisionist traitor clique.

    阿尔巴尼亚人民热烈欢呼毛主席声明具有重大历史意义
    毛主席声明鼓舞世界人民起来革命
    世界人民紧密团结向美帝苏修猛攻
    据新华社地拉那二十一日电　阿尔巴尼亚人民热烈欢呼毛主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明，他们指出，毛主席的声明不仅对美国黑人，而且对全世界人民都是巨大的激励和鼓舞，使他们更加紧密地团结起来，更加坚决地进行反对共同敌人美帝国主义的斗争。
    阿尔巴尼亚美洲人民友好团结委员会书记科塔对新华社记者说，毛泽东主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明具有重大的历史意义。毛泽东同志作为伟大的革命家和杰出的马克思列宁主义者，给美国的黑人和整个工人阶级指出了从资本主义的野蛮剥削和帝国主义的枷锁下彻底解放出来的革命道路。
    科塔说，阿尔巴尼亚美洲人民友好团结委员会热情欢呼这一声明，并把它看作是对美国黑人、美国工人阶级和全世界革命人民反对美帝国主义的斗争的新的鼓舞和巨大激励。毛泽东主席号召世界各国人民“行动起来，给予美国黑人的斗争以强大的声援！”革命人民将用加强反对美帝国主义的斗争的行动来响应这一号召。
    科塔指出，毛泽东同志的声明也是对各国人民反对以美帝国主义的头号帮凶苏修领导集团为首的现代修正主义的斗争的巨大鼓舞。
    科塔最后说，毛泽东主席在声明中表达的七亿中国人民和中国共产党对美国黑人的反对美帝国主义的斗争的强大支持和战斗声援，再次证明中华人民共和国的正确立场和她今天在世界上所起的作用。她给予正在进行争取民族解放的各国人民以可靠的和兄弟般的支持。
    地拉那市工会书记拉托说，毛泽东主席的声明对所有愿意进行反对美帝国主义的斗争和加强对美国黑人斗争的支持的工人、农民和革命知识分子，都具有重大的历史意义。他说，地拉那市的工人阶级和全体劳动人民热烈欢呼这一声明，把它看作是中国人民和中国共产党对各国人民争取解放、反对共同敌人美帝国主义的斗争的杰出贡献。
    地拉那斯大林纺织厂先进工人梅查伊说，我们工人热烈欢呼毛主席的声明，坚决支持美国黑人的英勇的抗暴斗争。我们在毛主席的声明中看到了中国人民和中国共产党对美国黑人斗争的无产阶级的声援。这个声明发表在现在这样的时刻，具有重大意义。它不仅动员和鼓舞美国黑人和整个美国人民起来反对美国反动派的野蛮压迫，而且也鼓舞着其它资本主义国家的人民起来推翻反动的资产阶级统治。
    地拉那区“新中国”农业合作社党支部书记贝基拉伊说，我们“新中国”农业合作社社员在读了毛泽东主席支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明后，完全一致地赞同和支持这个声明，同时对美帝国主义长期对黑人推行野蛮的种族歧视和压迫政策感到无比愤慨。我们相信，黑人的正义斗争必胜。贝基拉伊强调指出，毛主席向世界人民发出的支持美国黑人正义斗争的号召，得到各国人民的热烈支持。
    法律工作者巴兰查说，毛泽东主席的声明在阿尔巴尼亚所有劳动群众中引起了巨大的反应。这个声明不仅表达了七亿中国人民对美国黑人斗争的热烈支持，而且对他们的斗争作出了马克思列宁主义的深刻的科学分析，是对他们争取最后胜利的巨大鼓舞和激励。他说，美国的种族歧视，是殖民主义、帝国主义制度的可耻产物。正如毛主席在声明中指出的，只有摧毁殖民主义、帝国主义制度，才是黑人获得解放的唯一道路。
    地拉那大学工程系学生居尔乔伊说，伟大的马克思列宁主义者、阿尔巴尼亚人民最亲密的朋友毛主席的声明，不仅是对美国黑人和美国工人阶级，而且是对正在同美帝国主义及其仆从进行殊死搏斗的世界一切革命力量的巨大鼓舞和激励。他说，毛主席在声明中对世界革命形势所作的深刻的马克思列宁主义分析，也是一切革命者手中反对苏修叛徒集团的强大武器。
