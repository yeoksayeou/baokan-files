Johnson's murderous intentions are fully exposed as he hurriedly gathers cannon fodder to intensify the war of aggression against Vietnam. He is calling up reserve personnel from the army, navy, and air force to speed up troop deployments to South Vietnam, with the number of U.S. troops in Vietnam set to rise to over 540,000.

	BEIJING, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Washington: In the face of mounting casualties among U.S. troops in Vietnam, the U.S. imperialist head Johnson issued another order on April 11 to step up the recruitment of cannon fodder at home, preparing for more desperate struggles on the Vietnam battlefield.

	The newly appointed U.S. Secretary of Defense, Clifford, announced on April 11 that Johnson had ordered the call-up of 24,500 reserve personnel from the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force for active duty. Among them, 10,000 will be sent to South Vietnam, while the rest will be used to strengthen the U.S. strategic reserve. Clifford revealed that after these additional troops arrive in South Vietnam, the total number of U.S. troops in Vietnam will increase to approximately 549,500.

	At a press conference, Clifford also menacingly stated that the U.S. government is taking a series of measures to intensify the war of aggression against Vietnam. He also disclosed that the U.S. arms industry is ramping up the production of large quantities of murderous weapons to enhance the equipment of U.S. troops and the puppet army in South Vietnam.

	Furthermore, the U.S. imperialist leader Johnson announced on April 10 the appointment of the former U.S. deputy commander in Vietnam, Abrams, to replace the soon-to-be-removed Westmoreland as the commander of U.S. troops in Vietnam. Westmoreland was removed by Johnson in late March amidst the stunning victories of the Vietnamese people and army during the Tet Offensive, which left U.S. troops and the puppet army in disarray and chaos.

	Johnson's aforementioned series of actions indicate that U.S. imperialism is hurriedly mobilizing troops and expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam in a desperate attempt to salvage its doomed fate on the Vietnamese battlefield.

    加紧搜罗炮灰强化侵越战争
    征召陆海空预备役人员加速增兵南越，侵越美军将增至五十四万多
    新华社十二日讯　华盛顿消息：在侵越美军伤亡越来越惨重的情况下，美帝国主义头子约翰逊十一日再次下令在国内加紧搜罗炮灰，准备在侵越战场上进行更疯狂的垂死挣扎。
    新上台的美国国防部长克利福德十一日宣布，约翰逊已下令征召美国陆、海、空军预备役人员两万四千五百名服现役。其中的一万人将派往南越，其余部分将用来加强美国的战略预备队。克利福德透露，在这次增派的人员到达南越后，侵越美军总数将增加到大约五十四万九千五百人。
    克利福德在记者招待会上还杀气腾腾地表示，美国政府正在采取一系列措施，加紧强化侵越战争。他还透露，美国的军火工业正在加紧制造大批杀人武器，用以加强侵越美军和南越伪军的装备。
    此外，美帝头目约翰逊十日宣布，任命原侵越美军副司令艾布拉姆斯接替即将下台的威斯特摩兰担任侵越美军司令。威斯特摩兰是在南越军民新春攻势取得辉煌胜利，侵越美军和伪军被打得焦头烂额，狼狈不堪的时候，在三月下旬被约翰逊宣布撤职的。
    约翰逊上述一系列行动表明，美帝国主义正在加紧调兵遣将，扩大侵越战争，妄图挽救它在越南战场上彻底覆灭的命运。
