Chairman Mao teaches us: Revolutionary committees are good. The PLA soldiers and officers on the front lines of the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" in Shijiazhuang have studied Chairman Mao's great instructions on the revolutionary three-in-one combination through Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They have come to realize more deeply that they must cherish and support this new revolutionary power, the revolutionary committee. They have expressed their determination to always be vigilant and expose the class enemies' plots to shake and overthrow the revolutionary committee from the right or ultra-left, to safeguard the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and to safeguard the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "One of the important tasks on our ideological front at present is to carry out a criticism of revisionism." The revolutionary committee of the Shijiazhuang Railway Bureau's Engineering Section, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, leads the broad revolutionary cadres and masses to continue to deeply carry out the revolutionary criticism. They thoroughly criticize and expose the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of China's Khrushchev and his agents in the railway system, politically, ideologically, and theoretically.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolutionary committees should implement unified leadership, break down overlapping administrative organs, streamline administration, and organize a revolutionary leadership team that is connected with the masses." The revolutionary committee of Ping Shan County, Hebei Province, following Chairman Mao's great instructions, strives to build a revolutionary leadership team. This is a scene of revolutionary cadres, military representatives, and revolutionary mass representatives studying how to further implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." After the establishment of the revolutionary committee of Shijiazhuang No. 4 Cotton Mill, they have focused on the ideological revolutionization of the people. The workers of the fine spinning sixth group in this mill learn from each other, encourage each other, and help each other, launching a wave of emulation and help, greatly promoting production. This is a scene of workers from Class A and Class C exchanging shifts with the PLA comrades who are supporting the left, using Mao Zedong Thought to examine problems in their work.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must seize the revolution, promote production, promote work, promote preparedness, and do all aspects of work better, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end." The revolutionary committee of Shijiazhuang City, following Chairman Mao's great instructions, vigorously promotes agricultural production. This is a scene of PLA soldiers, revolutionary workers, revolutionary students, and broad revolutionary masses responding to the call of the revolutionary committee, together sending fertilizer to the suburban countryside.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "At present, it is the spring plowing season. I hope that all the leading comrades, cadres, and people in the liberated areas will seize the opportunity to grasp the production links and achieve greater results than last year." The advanced unit on the agricultural front in Hebei Province—Nanzhuanlonggou Brigade of Zhuangbei Commune in Ping Shan County, Shijiazhuang Region—the revolutionary cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants, together with the PLA comrades, study how to fully implement Chairman Mao's important instructions, striving for even greater agricultural production this year.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Never before has a mass movement been launched so broadly and deeply." The poor and lower-middle peasants of Xiaqiu Production Brigade in Jin County, Shijiazhuang Region, have set up Mao Zedong Thought study classes. The commune members, after studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, are all full of spirit and fighting spirit. This is a scene of commune members singing the great Mao Zedong Thought with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao in the fields.

Editor's Note:

Under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Hebei Province is excellent and getting better. An important sign of this excellent situation is that the people have been fully mobilized. The revolutionary committees at all levels in the Shijiazhuang Region, with a heart full of loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, grasp the use of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, leading the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses, have played a major role in the great struggle to achieve a comprehensive victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions are being turned into the actual actions of the broad revolutionary masses. Various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes are springing up like bamboo shoots after a rain. The revolutionary criticism is being carried out deeply and persistently. Revolution and production present a vigorous scene. We believe that the revolutionary committees at all levels in the Shijiazhuang Region, as long as they follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, grasp the root of learning and using Mao Zedong Thought in practice, carry out the ideological revolutionization of the people, and closely connect with the masses, will definitely do their work better.

    毛主席教导我们：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”石家庄国棉四厂革命委员会成立后，狠抓人的思想革命化。这个厂细纱六组的工人同志，互相学习，互相鼓励，互相帮助，掀起了比学赶帮的热潮，大大促进了生产。这是甲班工人、丙班工人在交接班时同支左的解放军同志一起，用毛泽东思想检查工作中的问题。

    在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，河北省的无产阶级文化大革命形势一片大好，越来越好。形势大好的重要标志，是人民群众充分发动起来了。石家庄地区的各级革命委员会对伟大领袖毛主席胸怀一个“忠”字，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想狠抓一个“用”字，带领着无产阶级和广大革命群众，在夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面胜利的伟大斗争中，发挥了重大的作用。毛主席的一系列最新指示正在变成广大革命群众的实际行动。各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班犹如雨后春笋。革命的大批判深入地、持久地开展着。革命和生产呈现出一派朝气勃勃的景象。我们相信，石家庄地区各级革命委员会，只要紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，只要紧紧地抓住活学活用、学好用好毛泽东思想这个根本，搞好人的思想革命化，密切地联系群众，一定会把工作做得更好。
