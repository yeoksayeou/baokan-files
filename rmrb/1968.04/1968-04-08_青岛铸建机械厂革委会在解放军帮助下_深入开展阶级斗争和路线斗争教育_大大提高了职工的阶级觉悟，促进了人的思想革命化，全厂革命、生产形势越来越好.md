Qingdao Casting and Construction Machinery Factory Revolutionary Committee, with the enthusiastic assistance of the PLA support-left personnel stationed in the factory, has followed the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle" and continuously deepened the education on class struggle and line struggle. This has significantly raised the class consciousness of the revolutionary workers, promoted the revolutionization of people's thinking, and made the revolutionary and production situation in the entire factory excellent. The factory has completed the first quarter's national production plan ahead of schedule by eight days.

After the proletarian revolutionary faction took power in this factory, they followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, liberated the cadres, united the broad masses, and did relatively well in all aspects of work. Amidst the praise, some comrades began to relax and become complacent, thinking that the situation was stable and that they should now focus on production. Some members of the revolutionary committee paid less attention to the class struggle and line struggle within the factory and were busy completing production tasks all day. In response to this situation, revolutionary masses posted big-character posters, sharply pointing out that the tendency to focus only on production without addressing class struggle and line struggle is a serious issue concerning the direction of the revolutionary committee.

The big-character posters by the revolutionary masses attracted the great attention of the PLA support-left personnel stationed in the factory. They decided to use the living facts of class struggle within the factory to help the revolutionary committee members and the broad revolutionary workers raise their awareness of class struggle and line struggle, emphasize proletarian politics, and use revolution to drive production. They went deep into the workshops, teams, and workers' dormitories, on one hand, vigorously promoting the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching of "never forget class struggle," and on the other hand, investigating the history of class struggle within the factory, guiding everyone to combine the actual class struggle within and outside the factory, repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's statements on class, class contradictions, and class struggle in socialist society; studying Chairman Mao's theory, line, principles, methods, and policies on continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The victory or defeat of the revolution will be decided over a very long historical period. If things are not handled properly, the restoration of capitalism is possible at any time." This made everyone realize that the establishment of the revolutionary committee is only the first step of the long march, not the end of class struggle and line struggle. Whether the revolutionary committee grasps class struggle and line struggle is a major issue concerning whether the revolutionary committee can hold power and use it well.

After raising the awareness of class struggle and line struggle and clarifying the relationship between revolution and production, the factory revolutionary committee members, with the help of the PLA support-left personnel stationed in the factory, mobilized the masses to hold various types of Mao Zedong Thought study classes and revolutionary criticism groups, from the factory, workshops, teams, to the workers' families. They persistently carried out education on class struggle and line struggle and revolutionary criticism. In the education on class struggle and line struggle, revolutionary workers extensively carried out "remembering bitterness and thinking of sweetness" activities. At the same time, they deeply carried out the revolutionary criticism movement throughout the factory. They actively applied Mao Zedong Thought, using various forms to criticize China's Khrushchev's reactionary fallacies such as the "extinction of class struggle" theory, making each criticism meeting a class on actively applying Chairman Mao's works.

"Class struggle, once grasped, works wonders." Through education on class struggle and line struggle and revolutionary criticism, the class struggle and line struggle awareness of the revolutionary workers has been significantly raised.

In a recent period, anarchist thoughts have spread in society. The revolutionary workers in this factory, from the perspective of class struggle and line struggle, recognized that anarchism is a bourgeois reactionary trend, and its emergence is a reflection of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in the new situation. Whether one can consciously overcome anarchism is a fundamental attitude towards loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. Thus, the workers, with Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, consciously engaged in self-criticism and criticized revisionism, launching a mass movement to suppress anarchism. They insisted on reporting and requesting instructions every morning and evening, and socialist labor discipline was significantly strengthened.

Currently, the revolutionary and production situation in this factory is getting better and better. Education on class struggle and line struggle and revolutionary criticism are being carried out more deeply, and production is continuously rising.

    青岛铸建机械厂革委会在解放军帮助下
    深入开展阶级斗争和路线斗争教育
    大大提高了职工的阶级觉悟，促进了人的思想革命化，全厂革命、生产形势越来越好
    新华社济南三日电　青岛铸建机械厂革命委员会在驻厂解放军支左人员的热情帮助下，遵循伟大领袖毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，不断地深入开展阶级斗争和路线斗争教育，大大提高了广大革命职工的阶级觉悟，促进了人的思想革命化，全厂革命、生产形势大好，提前八天超额完成第一季度国家生产计划。
    这个厂的无产阶级革命派掌权以后，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，解放了干部，团结了广大群众，各项工作都搞得比较好。在一片赞扬声中，有些同志思想开始松懈麻痹，认为大局已定，该腾出手来抓生产了。有些革委会成员对厂里两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争过问得少了，整天忙于完成生产任务。针对这种情况，革命群众贴出大字报，尖锐地指出：不问阶级斗争、路线斗争，只抓生产的倾向是关系到革命委员会向何处去的严重问题。
    革命群众的大字报引起了驻厂解放军支左人员的极大重视。他们决定用厂里活生生的阶级斗争事实帮助革委会成员以及广大革命职工提高阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟，突出无产阶级政治，以革命带动生产。他们深入车间、班组、工人宿舍，一面大力宣传伟大领袖毛主席“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的教导，一面调查厂里阶级斗争的历史，引导大家结合厂内外阶级斗争的实际，反复学习毛主席关于社会主义社会阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争的论述；学习毛主席关于无产阶级专政下继续革命的理论、路线、方针、方法和政策。
    毛主席教导我们：“革命的谁胜谁负，要在一个很长的历史时期内才能解决。如果弄得不好，资本主义复辟将是随时可能的。”使大家认识到：革命委员会的成立只是万里长征走完了第一步，而不是阶级斗争、路线斗争的结束。革委会抓不抓阶级斗争、路线斗争，是关系到革命委员会能不能掌好权用好权的重大问题。
    在提高了阶级斗争、路线斗争觉悟，摆正了革命与生产的关系以后，厂革委会成员在驻厂解放军支左人员的帮助下，发动群众举办了从厂、车间、班组，直至职工家庭的各种类型的毛泽东思想学习班和革命大批判小组，持久地开展阶级斗争、路线斗争教育和革命大批判。在阶级斗争和路线斗争教育中，革命职工广泛进行了忆苦思甜活动。同时在全厂深入开展了革命大批判运动，他们活学活用毛泽东思想，采用各种形式，对中国赫鲁晓夫“阶级斗争熄灭”论等反动谬论，进行专题批判，使每次批判会都成为活学活用毛主席著作的课堂。
      “阶级斗争，一抓就灵”。通过阶级斗争、路线斗争教育和革命大批判，广大革命职工的阶级斗争和路线斗争觉悟大大提高。
    前段时期，社会上滋长了无政府主义思想，这个厂的广大革命职工从阶级斗争和路线斗争上认识到无政府主义是一种资产阶级反动思潮，它的出现是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争在新形势下的反映，能不能自觉地克服无政府主义是忠不忠于伟大领袖毛主席的根本态度问题。于是，广大职工以毛主席的最新指示为纲，自觉地斗私、批修，掀起了一场围剿无政府主义的群众运动。他们每天早上班、晚下班、坚持请示汇报制度，社会主义的劳动纪律大大加强。
    目前这个厂的革命、生产形势越来越好，阶级斗争、路线斗争教育和革命大批判更加深入地展开，生产不断上升。
