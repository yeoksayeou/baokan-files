The intensified control and plunder of Latin America by U.S. imperialism have aroused continuous resistance from the broad masses of working people in Latin America. This year, the strikes by Latin American workers against political oppression and economic exploitation by U.S. monopolies and their agents have been ongoing and developing.

Many of the strikes by workers in Latin American countries have erupted in enterprises directly controlled by U.S. monopolies. In Bolivia, under the pro-U.S. military dictatorship, workers of the "Jones" construction company, operated by U.S. capital, broke through the threats and enticements of U.S. monopolies and the Bolivian reactionary authorities in early this year to launch a strike against the exploitation of U.S. monopolies. They also detained the company's senior American managers. In Guayaquil, the largest city in Ecuador, workers of the "International Timber Company," a joint venture between Ecuador and the U.S., recently went on strike to protest the arbitrary dismissal of union leaders by the American bosses. Workers in some U.S.-owned enterprises and mines in Peru, Colombia, and Chile have also gone on strike in recent times to oppose the exploitation and oppression of American capitalists.

U.S. imperialism is the biggest exploiter and plunderer of the people in various Latin American countries. Through the International Monetary Fund, which it controls, U.S. monopolies have implemented an economic plan in Chile aimed at wantonly exploiting the working people and destroying the national industry. This plan, as soon as it was introduced, met with strong opposition from the broad masses of working people in Chile. In April alone, more than 30,000 workers in U.S.-owned electric power, telephone, and other enterprises in Chile went on strike to protest the plan of U.S. monopolies to attack the Chilean working class. Previously, workers at the Maria Elena and Pedro de Valdivia nitrate plants in Chile had held several militant mass meetings to oppose the plunder and control of Chile by U.S. monopolies. In late March, tens of thousands of workers in the aviation, gas, and postal services in Chile participated in strike actions.

Due to the intensified plunder and exploitation by U.S. imperialism, the economic situation in Latin American countries has generally worsened. To defend their legitimate rights, the working people in these countries have continuously broken through the suppression of reactionary forces to rise up and fight. Sugar workers in Tucumán Province, Argentina, despite the repression of the reactionary regime, have repeatedly gone on strike, marched, and held rallies to angrily protest the economic "reorganization" plan of the Onganía regime, which faithfully implements the interests of U.S. monopolies and harms the interests of the working people. Although the Argentine reactionary regime sent large numbers of police to suppress the strikes, the sugar workers fearlessly fought back against the reactionary police. The struggle of the sugar workers in Tucumán has also received support from local residents. The struggle is still ongoing.

The struggle of Latin American workers against exploitation and oppression is unfolding in many countries and industries. In Brazil, under the pro-U.S. dictatorship, 15,000 steel workers in Minas Gerais state went on a large-scale strike in mid-April. On April 26, 200,000 employees in Uruguay, including the fuel, electricity, and postal sectors, went on strike to demand wage increases and improved living conditions.

    冲破反动势力压制　为争取劳动人民权利而战斗
    拉丁美洲工人展开反压迫反掠夺斗争
    许多罢工斗争爆发在美国垄断资本控制的企业里，给美帝以沉重打击
    据新华社二十九日讯　美帝国主义对拉丁美洲变本加厉的控制和掠夺，激起拉美广大劳动人民的不断反抗。今年来，拉美工人反对美国垄断资本及其代理人对他们进行政治压迫和经济剥削的罢工斗争，一直此起彼伏，持续发展。
    拉丁美洲国家的工人罢工斗争，其中许多是在美国垄断资本直接控制的企业里爆发。在亲美军事独裁统治下的玻利维亚，美国资本经营的“琼斯”建筑公司的工人，在今年年初冲破美国垄断资本以及玻利维亚反动当局的威胁和诱骗，举行了反对美国垄断资本压榨的罢工，并且扣押了这个公司的美国高级管理人员。在厄瓜多尔第一大城瓜亚基尔，厄美合营的“国际伐木公司”的工人最近举行罢工，抗议美国老板任意开除工会领导人。秘鲁、哥伦比亚、智利等国家的一些美资企业、厂矿的工人，不久前也先后举行罢工，反对美国资本家的剥削与压迫。
    美帝国主义是拉丁美洲各国人民最大的剥削者和掠夺者。美国垄断资本通过它所控制的国际货币基金组织，在智利推行一项旨在恣意盘剥劳动人民和摧残民族工业的经济计划，这项计划一出笼，就遭到智利广大劳动人民的强烈反对。仅在今年四月份，智利美资电力、电话以及其他美资企业的三万多名工人连续举行罢工，抗议美国垄断资本这项向智利工人阶级开刀的计划。在此以前，智利玛丽亚·埃伦娜和佩德罗·德巴尔迪维亚硝石厂的工人，曾多次举行富有战斗性的群众集会，反对美国垄断资本对智利的掠夺和控制。今年三月下旬，智利的民航、煤气和邮电等行业共有数万名工人参加罢工斗争。
    由于美帝国主义加紧掠夺和压榨，拉丁美洲国家的经济情况普遍恶化，各国劳动人民为了维护自己的正当权利，他们不断冲破反动势力的压制，起来进行斗争。阿根廷图库曼省的糖业工人不顾反动政权的镇压，不断举行罢工、游行和集会，愤怒抗议翁加尼亚政权忠实执行美国垄断资本的损害劳动人民利益的经济“改组”计划。尽管阿根廷反动政权派出大批军警进行镇压，但是糖业工人不畏强暴，与反动军警展开英勇搏斗。图库曼糖业工人的斗争，还得到当地居民支持。目前，斗争仍在发展中。
    拉丁美洲工人反剥削、反压迫的斗争，正在许多国家的许多行业中展开。在亲美独裁统治下的巴西，米纳斯吉斯州一万五千名钢铁工人在四月中旬举行了大规模的罢工。乌拉圭包括燃料、电力、邮电等部门在内的二十万名职工四月二十六日举行罢工，要求增加工资和改善生活待遇。
