The proletarian revolutionary forces and the broad masses of revolutionary workers on the coal industry front in Hebei Province have been vigorously carrying out class struggle and deeply and persistently conducting revolutionary criticism. This has made the revolution roar ahead and the coal production soar. The coal production in the province in February was 3.6 percent higher than in January, in March it was 5.8 percent higher than in February, and the average daily coal production in April showed a significant increase compared to March. By the 29th, coal mines such as Jixian, Fengfeng, and Xiahuayuan in the province had all completed their April coal production plans ahead of schedule. The large Kaiping coal mine saw its coal production increase each decade in April.

Under the guidance of the People's Liberation Army's support personnel, the broad masses of revolutionary workers on the coal industry front in Hebei Province have been actively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, firmly grasping the direction of the struggle, and insisting on carrying out the revolution above ground and promoting production below ground. They have concentrated their firepower and targets to launch a major exposure and criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the coal industry, purging the poison of their counter-revolutionary revisionism. Now, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, revolutionary criticism is being further carried out in all coal mines in the province. From the mine pits, work teams, to the workers' families, everywhere is a classroom for actively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and everywhere is a battlefield for revolutionary criticism. The broad masses of revolutionary workers, in conjunction with the actual class struggle in their units, have further exposed and criticized the "class struggle extinguished" theory, "material incentives," "production first," and other revisionist black goods promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the coal system. They have exposed and struck down the enemies of the proletarian revolution who attempt to sabotage production and overthrow the newly born revolutionary committees.

The revolutionary criticism has raised the class struggle consciousness of the broad masses of revolutionary workers, promoted the revolutionization of people's thinking, and pushed forward the development of production. The broad masses of revolutionary workers say: "The deeper we criticize revisionism, the closer we are to Chairman Mao; the more thorough we criticize revisionism, the tighter we follow Chairman Mao." They regard the implementation of Chairman Mao's great instructions of "grasp revolution, promote production" and "thrift for revolution" as an important sign of loyalty to Chairman Mao, loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They have vigorously carried out the movement to increase production and practice economy. The broad masses of revolutionary workers strive to be pioneers in the revolution and models in production, making technical innovations and technical revolution projects one after another, and pushing production forward vigorously.

    紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署　深入持久开展革命大批判
    河北省煤炭产量逐月上升
    据新华社石家庄二十九日电　河北省煤炭工业战线无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，狠抓阶级斗争，深入持久地开展革命大批判，使革命搞得轰轰烈烈，煤炭产量直线上升。二月份全省煤炭产量比一月份提高百分之三点六，三月份比二月份提高百分之五点八，四月份的煤炭平均日产量又比三月份有较大增长。到二十九日，全省已有井陉、峰峰、下花园等煤矿提前完成了四月份的国家煤炭生产计划，较大的开滦煤矿四月份的煤炭产量逐旬增长。
    河北省煤炭工业战线上的广大革命职工，在人民解放军支左人员的帮助下，活学活用毛泽东思想，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，坚持井上闹革命，下井促生产。他们集中火力，集中目标，向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在煤炭工业战线的代理人展开大揭露、大批判，肃清他们散布的反革命修正主义流毒。现在，全省各个煤矿在毛主席最新指示的指引下，革命大批判正在进一步开展起来。从矿井、班组到职工家庭，到处是活学活用毛泽东思想的课堂，到处是革命大批判的战场。广大革命职工结合本单位阶级斗争的实际，进一步大揭大批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在煤矿系统的代理人所推行的“阶级斗争熄灭”论和“物质刺激”、“生产第一”等修正主义黑货，揭露和打击无产阶级革命的敌人妄图破坏生产，颠覆新诞生的革命委员会的罪恶活动。
    革命大批判提高了广大革命职工的阶级斗争觉悟，促进了人的思想革命化，推动了生产的发展。广大革命职工说：“批修越深，我们对毛主席越亲；批修越透，我们跟毛主席越紧。”他们把贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”和“要节约闹革命”的伟大指示，看作是忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的一个重要标志，轰轰烈烈地开展增产节约运动。广大革命职工争当革命的闯将，生产的模范，使技术革新和技术革命项目一个接着一个实现，生产蓬蓬勃勃地向前发展。
