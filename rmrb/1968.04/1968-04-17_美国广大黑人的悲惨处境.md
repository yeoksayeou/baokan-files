The miserable plight of the broad masses of black people in the United States

The unemployment rate among black people is several times higher than that of whites. According to statistics released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in February of this year, in the 20 largest metropolitan areas in the United States, nearly one-third of non-white youth of working age (the vast majority of whom are black) are unemployed.

Due to the use of machinery by farm owners in the American South to replace manual labor, tens of thousands of black people leave their hometowns every year, migrating from rural areas to cities and joining the ranks of the unemployed. According to reports from Western capitalist newspapers, from 1950 to 1966, about 5.2 million black people were forced to migrate from the rural South to cities.

Black people's wages and working conditions are far inferior to those of whites doing the same work. The average income of black families is 52% lower than that of white families. Black people's average wages are only one-third to one-half of those of whites. U.S. monopolistic capitalists alone extract at least $14 billion in excess profits annually from black workers by exploiting the wage gap between black and white workers.

Black people are forced to live in slums in major U.S. cities. The living conditions are extremely poor. Approximately 8 million black residents are crammed into the slums of 12 major U.S. cities (accounting for one-fifth of the black population in these cities). In the dark and dilapidated black slums of New York's Watts district, more than 80,000 black people are crowded together. Ninety percent of the houses there were built before World War II and are in a state of disrepair. In the black slums of New York's Harlem, about 500,000 black people live. Nearly half of the houses here were built in the early 20th century. The houses are dark and damp, with piles of garbage and swarms of rats, yet the rent is extremely high.

The infant mortality rate among black people is as high as 15%, three times that of white infants. According to U.S. government statistics, the average lifespan of black people is significantly lower than that of whites.

U.S. imperialism forces large numbers of black people to go to South Vietnam to serve as cannon fodder in the Vietnam War. Black people make up about 10% of the U.S. population, but black soldiers account for 25% of the U.S. troops in Vietnam. In the paratrooper units with the highest casualty rates, the proportion of black casualties is over 40%.

Black people are also severely discriminated against in their political rights. In many states in the U.S. South, black people's voting rights are still openly denied and strictly limited. Black voters must undergo so-called "cultural tests" and "intelligence tests" before they can vote. Millions of black people who are impoverished and cannot read are deprived of their voting rights. Even if black people can vote, they face threats, beatings, and even being shot.

The lives of black people in the United States are not guaranteed. They can be arbitrarily arrested and shot by reactionary police at any time. The Ku Klux Klan, composed of white supremacists, is a fascist organization that uses terror, lynching, kidnapping, and assassination to persecute black people.

### 美国广大黑人的悲惨处境

    美国广大黑人的悲惨处境
    失业率高白人几倍
    美国黑人失业率比白人高三倍至四倍。据美国劳工统计局今年二月发表的统计，在美国全国二十个最大的城市地区，有近三分之一的达到就业年龄的非白种青年（其中绝大部分是黑人）失业。
    由于美国南部农场主采用机器代替人工，每年都有数十万美国黑人离乡背井，从农村流入城市，加入失业大军。据西方资产阶级报刊报道，从一九五○年到一九六六年，被迫从南部农村流入城市的黑人就有五百二十万人左右。
    工资低劳动条件差
    美国黑人工资和劳动条件远远低劣于干同样工作的白人。黑人家庭的平均收入比白人家庭平均收入低百分之五十二。黑人工资平均只及白人的三分之一至二分之一。美国垄断资本单单从黑人工人和白人工人的工资差距中，每年就从黑人身上榨取超额利润至少达一百四十亿美元。
    居住条件十分恶劣
    黑人被迫聚居在美国各大城市的贫民窟里。居住条件十分恶劣。美国十二个大城市的贫民窟里大约拥塞了八百万黑人居民
  （占这些城市黑人的五分之二）。纽约瓦茨区里阴暗破烂的黑人贫民窟，却拥挤着八万多黑人。那里百分之九十的房子都是二次大战前造的，已破烂不堪。纽约哈莱姆黑人贫民窟，聚居着约五十万黑人。这里近一半的房屋是在二十世纪初建造的，房子阴暗潮湿，垃圾成堆，老鼠成群，而房租却特别昂贵。
    平均寿命低于白人
    美国黑人婴儿死亡率高达百分之十五，为白人婴儿死亡率的三倍。据美国政府的统计数字表明，黑人的平均寿命大大低于白人。
    被迫充当侵越炮灰
    美帝国主义强迫大批黑人到南越去充当侵越战争的炮灰。黑人占美国人口的百分之十左右，但侵越美军中黑人却占百分之二十五。在伤亡最大的伞兵中，黑人伤亡的比例在百分之四十以上。
    政治权利备受歧视
    美国广大黑人在政治权利方面也备受歧视。在美国南方许多州里，黑人的选举权至今仍被公开剥夺和受到严格限制。黑人选民在投票前要受到所谓“文化测验”和所谓“智力测验”的刁难。因贫困而不能读书的千百万黑人被剥夺了选举权。黑人即使能够投票参加选举，也要遭到恐吓、殴打甚至被枪杀。‘
    生命根本没有保障
    美国黑人的生命根本没有保障。他们随时都可能被反动警察任意逮捕和枪杀。由白人种族主义者组成的“三K党”，更是一个专门用恐怖、私刑、绑架、暗杀等残酷手段迫害黑人的法西斯组织。
