The thunder of spring rolls across the land. The people of all China and the revolutionary people of the whole world enthusiastically acclaim the publication of the great leader Chairman Mao's statement "In Support of the American Blacks' Struggle Against Violence"!

In the face of the rising tide of anti-imperialist struggles of the revolutionary peoples of the world, and the storm of class struggle and national struggle sweeping the ruling reactionary clique of the United States, the publication of Chairman Mao's statement is a great support for the American blacks' struggle against violence. It is a great encouragement to all oppressed and exploited peoples and nations in their struggle for national freedom and liberation. It is a heavy blow to imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries.

Chairman Mao said: "The struggle of the American blacks is not only a struggle for freedom and liberation by the oppressed and exploited blacks, but it is also a new call to arms for all the oppressed and exploited American people against the brutal rule of the monopoly bourgeoisie." "The struggle of the American blacks for liberation is a component part of the total struggle of the people of the world against American imperialism, and a component part of the world revolution today." Chairman Mao has given a high evaluation of the American blacks' struggle against violence and has made the deepest exposition of the significance of the American blacks' just struggle.

The mighty and sweeping struggle of the American blacks, swift in its onset and vast in its scale, profoundly shows that the class consciousness of the American blacks is constantly rising, and the broad masses of blacks are increasingly closely linking up their struggle with the struggle of the American people against the monopoly bourgeoisie and the struggle of the oppressed peoples and nations of the world for liberation. The struggle of the American blacks against violence has opened up a new front for attacking American imperialism from within. The Vietnam War, the dollar crisis, and the black struggle are three tightly interlocked chains around the neck of American imperialism. The just struggle of the American blacks powerfully promotes the development of the class struggle within and outside the United States, shaking the foundations of the reactionary rule of American imperialism. American imperialism has already fallen into an unprecedentedly serious political and economic crisis, beset with contradictions and at its wits' end. The revolutionary peoples of the whole world and the American people must strengthen their unity in the struggle against American imperialism, support each other, and launch a sustained and fierce offensive! The day of the complete burial of American imperialism is not far off.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war. This Marxist-Leninist principle of revolution is universally correct, whether in China or abroad, it is universally correct."

Imperialism and reactionaries have always maintained their reactionary rule through political deception and violent suppression. American imperialism wields the knife to slaughter revolutionary people, and the revolutionary people must take up the knife in return, using revolutionary violence against counter-revolutionary violence. Violent revolution is the inevitable law of class struggle, the necessary path for the oppressed peoples and nations to achieve liberation.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The oppressed peoples and nations can never pin their hopes for liberation on the 'wisdom' and 'good intentions' of imperialism and its running dogs."

The Soviet revisionist renegade clique, however, prattles on endlessly about the "wisdom" and "good intentions" of imperialism, shamelessly betraying the fundamental interests of the proletariat and laboring people of the whole world. The peoples of all countries have come to recognize from their own struggles that the path of class harmony and class cooperation advocated by the revisionists is a path of capitulation and submission, a path of shamelessly serving the imperialists. For all revolutionary peoples, only by mobilizing the masses, relying on the masses, and taking up arms can they achieve victory; only by overthrowing the capitalist system with violence can they eliminate racial discrimination and national oppression.

All the workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, and all those who are willing to oppose American imperialism of the world, take action! Down with American imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism! American imperialism must be defeated! The struggle of the American blacks against violence must be victorious!

    胜利的指针
    高等军事学院无产阶级革命派
    春雷滚滚震天下。全中国人民和全世界革命人民，热烈欢呼伟大导师毛主席《支持美国黑人抗暴斗争的声明》的发表！
    在世界革命人民的反帝斗争日益高涨，在美国国内阶级斗争和民族斗争的大风暴猛袭美国反动统治集团的大好形势下，毛主席声明的发表，是对美国黑人抗暴斗争的极大支持，是对一切被剥削、被压迫人民和被压迫民族为争取民族自由和解放的斗争的极大鼓舞，是对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的沉重打击。
    毛主席说：“美国黑人的斗争，不仅是被剥削、被压迫的黑人争取自由解放的斗争，而且是整个被剥削、被压迫的美国人民反对垄断资产阶级残暴统治的新号角。”“美国黑人争取解放的斗争，是全世界人民反对美帝国主义的总斗争的一个组成部分，是当代世界革命的一个组成部分。”毛主席给美国黑人抗暴斗争高度的评价，对美国黑人正义斗争的意义作了最深刻的论述。
    气势磅礴、如燎原烈火的美国黑人斗争，来势迅猛，规模壮阔。它深刻地表明了美国黑人的阶级觉悟日益提高，广大黑人越来越紧密地同美国人民反对垄断资产阶级的斗争以及世界被压迫人民和民族的解放斗争联系起来。美国黑人的抗暴斗争，开辟了从美国内部进攻美帝国主义的战线。侵越战争、美元危机和黑人斗争，是套在美帝国主义脖子上的三条紧密相连的锁链。而美国黑人的正义斗争，则有力地推动着美国国内外阶级斗争的发展，动摇着美帝国主义的反动统治的根基。美帝国主义已陷入了空前严重的政治危机和经济危机中，矛盾重重，走投无路。全世界革命人民同美国人民在反对美帝国主义的斗争中加强团结，互相支持，展开持久的猛烈的进攻！彻底埋葬美帝国主义的日子已经为期不远了。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。这个马克思列宁主义的革命原则是普遍地对的，不论在中国在外国，一概都是对的。”
    帝国主义和反动派从来都是靠政治欺骗和暴力镇压以维持其反动统治的。美帝国主义手里拿着刀屠杀革命人民，革命人民一定要按照它的办法，也拿起刀来，以革命的暴力反对反革命的暴力。暴力革命，是阶级斗争的必然规律，是被压迫人民和被压迫民族争取解放的必由之路。
    毛主席教导我们：“被压迫人民和被压迫民族，决不能把自己的解放寄托在帝国主义及其走狗的“明智”上面”。
    苏修叛徒集团，却喋喋不休地宣传帝国主义的“明智”和
  “善良意愿”，公然无耻地出卖全世界无产阶级和劳动人民的根本利益。各国人民从自己的斗争经验中认识到，修正主义者所鼓吹的阶级调和、阶级合作的道路，是屈膝投降、任人宰割的道路，是恬不知耻地为帝国主义者效劳。对于一切革命人民来说，只有动员群众，依靠群众，拿起枪杆子，才能赢得胜利；只有以暴力推翻资本主义制度，才能消灭种族歧视和民族压迫。
    全世界的工人、农民、革命知识分子和一切愿意反对美帝国主义的人们行动起来！打倒美帝！打倒苏修！美帝必败！美国黑人的抗暴斗争必胜！
