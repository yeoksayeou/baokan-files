Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the historical stage of socialism, class, class contradictions, and class struggle still exist; the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads still exists; and there is the danger of capitalist restoration." After the Party Central Committee, with Chairman Mao at its helm, crushed the savage attack of the bourgeois agent High Gang anti-Party clique in 1954, it again dismissed the actual leader of the High Gang clique, Peng Dehuai, at the Lushan Conference in 1959. This was a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought. However, a handful of remnants of the High Gang clique, unwilling to accept defeat, changed their tactics and used novels and films to continue their anti-Party activities. The reactionary film "Red River Waves" is such a poisonous weed.

This film, under the pretense of depicting the growth of a guerrilla unit in the Shaan-Gan border area during the second phase of the domestic revolutionary war, uses the story of the protagonist Zhang Tiewa organizing armed forces to open up a base area, to erect a monument to the High Gang clique and attempt to obscure the brilliance of the great Mao Zedong Thought. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party who plotted and produced this reactionary film set the tone for their "creation" from the beginning: "The focus must be on 'Nanliang,' with 'encirclement and suppression' and 'counter-encirclement and suppression' as the background, and 'Party history materials' as the guiding ideology." It is well known that the so-called "Nanliang" is where the anti-Party leader High Gang usurped the position of political commissar of the 26th Army. The so-called "encirclement and suppression" and "counter-encirclement and suppression" is to steal credit from heaven and attribute the great victory of the second phase of the domestic revolutionary war to the anti-Party leader High Gang. The so-called "Party history materials" is the infamous "Brief History of the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Area," which was fabricated based on a report by High Gang in 1942 that falsified history, reversed black and white, and boasted of himself. This black history shamelessly praises the anti-Party schemer High Gang for creating a "correct line" and preserving "the last and largest revolutionary base area." What a "focus on Nanliang" and "guiding ideology of Party history materials"! Isn't this a clear revelation of the reactionary political purpose of summoning the spirit of the traitor High Gang and rehabilitating the anti-Party clique?

The reactionary film enthusiastically praises Zhang Tiewa, who is the incarnation of the anti-Party schemer High Gang. At a script discussion meeting, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the former Gansu Provincial Party Committee openly shouted: "They are not writing about a small guerrilla unit, but historical evidence," "They are not writing about Zhang Tiewa, but the Party's leadership." Therefore, they specially ordered the film to "concentrate the time before 1935, to reflect how we revolutionized and how we struggled to open up the base area before the arrival of the Red Army (Central Red Army)." What "Party's leadership"? In essence, it is High Gang's leadership. In their eyes, High Gang is the Party. To sing praises and erect monuments for their master, they shamelessly plagiarize the brilliant thoughts of our great leader Chairman Mao to dress up the political corpse of High Gang. The film vigorously describes the scene of arduous struggle under the leadership of Zhang Tiewa, the incarnation of High Gang, in the face of strong external enemies and internal erroneous lines. It was he who "invented" guerrilla warfare, established revolutionary armed forces, and opened up red base areas; it was he who opposed both "left" adventurism and "right" escapism. Under his "correct line," the enemy's "encirclement and suppression" was smashed, the lairs of the stubborn enemies were destroyed, and the way was cleared for the Red Army marching north to resist Japan. It seems that Zhang Tiewa, the incarnation of High Gang, is the sole representative of the "correct line" within the Party. But what is the real history? It turns out that the filmmakers actually moved the event of liberating Yongle Town, which occurred after 1935, to 1935, and attributed all the heroic deeds created by the people of Shaan-Gan under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao to the "merit book" of the traitor High Gang. This is not historical evidence at all; it is a complete fabrication!

The remnants of the High Gang anti-Party clique have long been scheming to elevate High Gang to stand on equal footing with our great leader Chairman Mao. They equate the Nanliang area, where High Gang was entrenched, with the Central Soviet Area established by Chairman Mao, shouting slogans like "South has Jinggangshan, North has Yongning Mountain," "South has Ruijin, North has Zhaojin." The film "Red River Waves" has visualized this reactionary thought of the High Gang clique.

To highlight the difficulties in establishing the Nanliang base area by High Gang, the filmmakers arranged a conflict in the film: this is the intense struggle between the Nationalist Party's militia commander Yao Deyuan's statement that "we must not let Zhang Tiewa stand firm" and Zhang Tiewa's response that "we must stand firm."

The film begins by hinting that the Chinese revolution is in a low ebb, with Yao Deyuan's "suppression of communists" being rewarded and promoted to commander, returning home in glory. Then, through the mouths of many people and countless scenes, it exaggerates Zhang Tiewa's return to his hometown with straw sandals and a heavy mission, leading the guerrilla unit to carry out struggles, emphasizing Zhang Tiewa's personal role. In the literary script, the filmmakers, through the mouth of Yang the carpenter, say, "Our ancestors for three generations have been farmers. Farmers know how precious a seed is! Tiewa is the hope of all the poor people in the valley. It is better to have no us than to have no him!" Even more vilely, they deliberately describe Zhang Tiewa "wrapped in the morning breeze, stepping on the dawn, striding like a tiger on the majestic mountains," followed by the song "the sun is out, let's make a revolution." The filmmakers blatantly compare the anti-Party leader High Gang to the red sun that saves the Chinese revolution. This is intolerable! Despite this, they still felt it was not enough and added in the fifth draft of the literary script that after Zhang Tiewa led the people to capture Yongle Town, he climbed to the top of the city wall and hoisted a red flag fluttering in the wind. He stood proudly under the red flag, and countless red flags were "imprinted" from the high-held red flag. The filmmakers used this despicable method to falsify history and attempt to elevate the anti-Party schemer High Gang to the status of the savior of the Chinese people. However, they were afraid of being exposed, so they later deleted these scenes during filming and changed the ending of the film to Zhang Tiewa shooting down Yao Deyuan into the Red River with a crossbow, followed by Zhang Tiewa riding a tall horse, with countless troops surging in behind him. This is a more concealed way to sing praises for High Gang and more viciously propagandize the reactionary fallacy of "Shaanbei saving the Central."

Who is the creator of the revolutionary base area? Who is the savior of the people of Shaanbei? We, the hundreds of millions of revolutionary people, will unanimously answer: It is our great leader Chairman Mao, and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. As early as forty years ago, our great teacher Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the great Autumn Harvest Uprising with great historical significance, marched to Jinggangshan, and opened up China's first revolutionary base area. Since then, this base area has been like a lighthouse shining with radiance, illuminating the path of the Chinese revolution. The Shaan-Gan revolutionary base area was precisely developed and grown under the great thought of Chairman Mao, guided by the great practice of the revolutionary struggle on Jinggangshan. However, due to the control of the Wang Ming "left" opportunist line and the third "encirclement and suppression" launched by the Kuomintang bandits in Shaanbei, the revolution in Shaan-Gan suffered repeated setbacks and failures, and the situation was extremely critical. At this most critical juncture, Chairman Mao led the Central Red Army to Shaanbei in October 1935, thoroughly corrected the "left" opportunist line, and personally led the counterattack against the Kuomintang bandits' "encirclement and suppression." Our great leader Chairman Mao's intimate comrade-in-arms, Vice Commander Lin Biao, based on Chairman Mao's guiding ideology of annihilation warfare, led the Central Red Army and the Northwest 15th Red Army Corps to annihilate the enemy's 109th Division and capture the enemy division commander in Zhiluo Town. Then, in the pursuit, they annihilated a regiment of the enemy's 106th Division at Heishuitang, completely shattering the enemy's third "encirclement and suppression" and saving the crisis of the Shaan-Gan revolutionary base area. As Chairman Mao pointed out: "The battle of Zhiluo Town, the brotherly unity of the Central Red Army and the Northwest Red Army, shattered the traitor Chiang Kai-shek's 'encirclement and suppression' of the Shaan-Gan border area, and held a foundation-laying ceremony for the task of the Party Central Committee to place the national revolutionary headquarters in the northwest."

This is the true face of history. The remnants of the High Gang anti-Party clique attempt to use the corpse of Zhang Tiewa to summon the spirit of High Gang, to erect a monument to the anti-Party element and great traitor High Gang, which is a pipe dream!

The film also tries hard to portray High Gang's incarnation Zhang Tiewa as the "founder" of the people's revolutionary armed forces. In the black "Brief History," it praises High Gang for recognizing the importance of "seizing weapons" and "grasping armed struggle" from the bitter lessons of the failure of the first phase of the domestic revolutionary war due to the lack of weapons; recognizing that "relying on rural and mountainous areas to wage guerrilla warfare is the way out." The film, on the other hand, emphasizes that after Zhang Tiewa and Gao Feihu arrived at Changsheng Yu, they developed a vast revolutionary armed force with just one pistol. When Zhang Tiewa came to Old Liu's house, this old poor peasant said with great hope, "The matter of fighting... we all don't know, there is no leader!" At this time, Zhang Tiewa said passionately, "Fellow villagers! I and Comrade Feihu came here to mobilize everyone to take up arms!" Immediately in the "rob the temple" scene, Zhang Tiewa shot dead the evil landlord and militia commander Sun Ban Yuan, and then immediately shouted in the tone of a savior, "Everyone wants to live a good life, only by joining the Red Army, organizing, taking up weapons, and following the Communist Party to make a revolution." Immediately, the screen shows a crowd of people joining the Red Army, holding up knives, spears, and gathering around High Gang's incarnation Zhang Tiewa.

The filmmakers arranged many scenes and repeatedly emphasized the importance of guns, armed struggle, and guerrilla warfare through Zhang Tiewa's mouth. Their purpose is to attempt to steal the great theory and brilliant practice of Chairman Mao in establishing revolutionary armed forces, waging guerrilla warfare, and seizing political power with guns, to beautify the traitor High Gang, and to achieve the evil purpose of rehabilitating the High Gang anti-Party clique and creating a counter-revolutionary public opinion for the total behind-the-scenes boss of the anti-Party clique, Chinese Khrushchev, to usurp the Party, the army, and the government. However, history cannot be falsified, and black hands cannot cover the sun! The founder of the Chinese people's revolutionary armed forces is our great leader Chairman Mao. It was Chairman Mao who led the Autumn Harvest Uprising, established the workers' and peasants' armed forces, and then, at the famous "Gutian Conference," summarized the rich practical experience with brilliant insights, personally formulated the Red Army's military line, criticized various bourgeois military lines, and thus established the Red Army completely on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, elevating Marxism-Leninism's military thought to a new stage. For decades, under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian military thought, our army has grown from a "spark" into a "blazing flame." In the past, we relied on this army to overthrow the three mountains and seize power; today, this army has become a great wall for defending the socialist revolution and the socialist mountains and rivers. The creator of this unparalleled great army is Chairman Mao. History is the iron witness. The few anti-Party clowns of the High Gang clique attempt to steal credit from heaven and claim it for themselves, which is a foolish dream!

Guided by the reactionary ideas of the "Brief History of the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Area," the film "Red River Waves" specially fabricated scenes of the struggle between Zhang Tiewa, the incarnation of High Gang, and "left" and right opportunism.

In the literary script of "Red River Waves," they maliciously added a "left" opportunist special envoy, Old Zhu. Old Zhu advocated "mobilizing everyone" and "striking all lines," criticizing Zhang Tiewa, the incarnation of High Gang, as "escapism" and "mountainism." Zhang Tiewa dared to insist on the truth and engaged in a sharp struggle with the "left" adventurist line. After the failure of the grain seizure battle, some guerrilla soldiers developed right opportunist sentiments, proposing to "'bury guns on the hill' and 'individually connect with the masses,'" and Zhang Tiewa immediately corrected this rightist thinking upon arrival, "enhancing everyone's confidence in victory..." The filmmakers went to great lengths to embellish the anti-Party leader High Gang, intending to tell the audience that the Shaan-Gan base area has long had a "correct" line represented by High Gang fighting against "left" and right opportunism. This is a complete deception by the High Gang clique to falsify history! As long as we open the "Brief History of the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Area," we can find that this is nothing more than a replica of the "after Comrade High Gang arrived," "insisted on the correct direction," "continuously overcame the right opportunist defeatist thoughts and 'left' impetuousness in the revolutionary ranks, making the Party's leading cadres further realize the importance of persisting in rural guerrilla warfare and establishing a base area" boasted in the "Brief History of the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Area." The purpose is to erase the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought and propagandize the anti-Party leader High Gang as the representative of the "sole correct line." In fact, High Gang's life was a life of crime, a life of anti-Party activities. He was engaged in "surrenderism" and "banditry," advocating the "military line," ruling the mountains as kings, and was a genuine old opportunist.

The practice of the Chinese revolutionary struggle eloquently proves that our great leader Chairman Mao is the founder and representative of the Chinese proletarian revolutionary line, and Mao Zedong Thought is a truth applicable to all. When we implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, our cause prospers; when we go against Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, our cause suffers setbacks. The filmmakers of the reactionary film "Red River Waves" strive to cover up and erase this red line, attempting to replace it with the black line of the anti-Party leader High Gang, which is like an ant shaking a big tree, laughable and self-delusional!

The thunder of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution shakes the land of the motherland; the storm of the people's revolution washes away all filth. The reactionary film "Red River Waves" is a spirit banner of the High Gang anti-Party clique, a plot by Chinese Khrushchev to usurp the Party, the army, and the government. Let us raise the banner of revolutionary criticism, denounce and expose, thoroughly settle the accounts of the High Gang anti-Party clique and their total behind-the-scenes boss Chinese Khrushchev's heinous crimes, thoroughly purge all their poisonous influences, and let the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought forever shine over all of China and the world!

    烧毁高岗反党集团的招魂幡
    ——评反动影片《红河激浪》
    甘肃省革命委员会政治部大批判组　兰州部队战斗文工团革命委员会
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“在社会主义这个历史阶段中，还存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，存在着社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争，存在着资本主义复辟的危险性。”以毛主席为首的党中央在一九五四年粉碎了资产阶级代理人高岗反党集团的猖狂进攻之后，又在一九五九年的庐山会议上罢了高岗集团的实际领袖彭德怀的官，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。但是，一小撮高岗集团的余党不甘心失败，为了替其主子翻案，他们变换手法，利用小说、电影继续进行反党活动。反动影片《红河激浪》就是这样的一株大毒草。
    这部影片，以描写第二次国内革命战争时期陕甘边区一支游击队的成长为幌子，通过主人公张铁娃组织武装开辟根据地的故事，为高岗集团树碑立传，妄图遮住伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉。策划炮制这部反动影片的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，一开始就定下了这样的“创作”基调：必须“以南梁为中心，以‘围剿’和反‘围剿’为背景，以党史资料为指导思想”。众所周知，所谓“南梁”就是反党头子高岗窃据红二十六军政委时活动的中心。所谓以“围剿”和反“围剿”为背景，就是要贪天之功，把第二次国内革命战争的伟大胜利记在反党头子高岗的功劳簿上。所谓“党史资料”就是臭名昭著的《陕甘宁边区简史》。这部《简史》是根据高岗在一九四二年所作的一个伪造历史，颠倒黑白，自我吹嘘的报告编造出来的一部黑史。这部黑史无耻地吹捧反党野心家高岗创造了一条“正确路线”，保存了“一个最后最大的革命根据地”。好个“以南梁为中心”，“以党史资料为指导思想”，这不是一语道破了为叛徒高岗招魂，为反党集团翻案的反动政治目的吗！
    这部反动影片所狂热吹捧的张铁娃，就是反党野心家高岗的化身。在一次剧本讨论会上，旧甘肃省委内的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派就公然叫嚷：他们“不是写的一支小小的游击队，写的是历史的证据”，“不是写的张铁娃而是党的领导”。为此，特别限令影片必须“把时间集中在一九三五年以前，以体现红军（中央红军）没有到达之前”，我们“是如何革命”，如何“创业维艰”，如何“开辟根据地”的。
    什么“党的领导”？说穿了，就是高岗的领导。在他们眼里高岗就是党。为了替主子歌功颂德，树碑立传，他们竟丧心病狂地剽窃我们伟大领袖毛主席的光辉思想，来装扮高岗这具政治僵尸。影片非常卖力描写在高岗的化身张铁娃的领导下，在外有强大敌人，内有错误路线的重重困难中，艰苦奋斗的情景。是他“发明”了游击战，建立了革命武装，开辟了红色根据地；是他既反对了“左”倾盲动主义，又反对了右倾逃跑路线。在他的“正确路线”指引下，粉碎了敌人的“围剿”，摧毁了顽敌的老窝，为北上抗日的红军“扫清了道路”。看样子，高岗的化身张铁娃就是党内“正确路线”的唯一代表。可是，真实的历史究竟如何呢？原来影片炮制者竟把发生在一九三五年以后的解放永乐镇事件，提到一九三五年去写，把陕甘宁人民在毛主席亲自领导下创造的英雄业绩统统记到叛徒高岗的“功劳簿”上。这哪里是什么“历史的证据”，这是彻头彻尾的捏造！
    高岗反党集团余孽，早就处心积虑要把高岗抬出来与我们伟大领袖毛主席分庭抗礼。他们把高岗盘踞的南梁地区与毛主席创立的中央苏区相提并论。叫嚷什么“南有井冈山，北有永宁山”，“南有瑞金，北有照金”。影片《红河激浪》就把高岗集团的这一反动思想形象化了。
    为了表现高岗“创立”南梁根据地的艰难，炮制者在影片中安排了一组矛盾：这就是国民党的民团司令姚德元所说的“决不能叫张铁娃站稳脚跟”和张铁娃所回答的“我们一定要站稳脚跟”的激烈斗争。
    影片一开始就以姚贼“剿共”有功，晋升司令衣锦荣归来暗示中国革命处于低潮。接着，又通过许多群众之口，通过无数画面大肆渲染张铁娃脚穿草鞋，身负重任，带着游击队返回故乡开展斗争，以突出张铁娃个人的作用。在文学剧本中，炮制者通过杨木匠之口，说什么“咱家祖宗三代都是庄稼人，庄稼人知道一颗种子贵如命啊！铁娃是咱全塬穷人的希望，宁可没有咱，也不能没有他啊！”更为恶毒的是，还特意描写了张铁娃“披着清风，踏着朝霞，在巍峨的山岭上迈着虎步”，紧接着就是“太阳出来了，快把革命闹”的歌声，炮制者公然把反党头子高岗比作拯救中国革命的红太阳。是可忍，孰不可忍！尽管如此，他们还嫌不足，又在第五稿文学剧本中，大写张铁娃率众打下永乐镇之后，爬上城头插上一面迎风招展的红旗，他岿然站在红旗下，从高擎的红旗里“迭印”出无数面红旗。炮制者通过这种卑劣手法篡改历史，妄图把反党野心家高岗捧为中国人民的救星。可是他们作贼心虚，怕露了馅，后来拍摄时，忍痛删掉这些镜头，把影片结尾改为张铁娃一梭标将姚贼击落红河后，张铁娃骑着高头大马，浩浩荡荡的千军万马随之蜂拥而来。以更隐蔽的方式歌颂高岗，更恶毒地宣扬“陕北救中央”的反动谬论。
    究竟谁是革命根据地的缔造者？谁是陕北人民的救星？我们亿万革命人民会同声回答：是伟大的领袖毛主席，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。早在四十年前，我们伟大的导师毛主席亲自发动和领导了具有伟大历史意义的秋收起义，进军井冈山，开辟了中国第一个革命根据地。从此，这个根据地象一座光芒四射的灯塔，照亮了中国革命前进的道路。陕甘革命根据地，正是根据毛主席的伟大思想，在井冈山革命斗争的伟大实践的指引下，成长和发展起来的。但是，由于王明“左”倾路线的控制，加之蒋介石匪军向陕北发动的第三次“围剿”，陕甘的革命屡遭挫折和失败，形势十分危急。就在这个最危急的关头，毛主席于一九三五年十月，率领中央红军到达了陕北，彻底纠正了“左”倾路线，并亲自领导了反击国民党匪军的“围剿”。我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪副统帅根据毛主席打歼灭战的指导思想，率领中央红军和西北红十五军团，在直罗镇全歼敌一○九师，活捉敌师长。接着又在追击中消灭了敌一○六师一个团于黑水寺，彻底粉碎了敌人的第三次“围剿”，解救了陕甘革命根据地的危机。正如毛主席指出的：“直罗镇一仗，中央红军同西北红军兄弟般的团结，粉碎了卖国贼蒋介石向着陕甘边区的‘围剿’，给党中央把全国革命大本营放在西北的任务，举行了一个奠基礼。”
    这就是历史的真实面貌。高岗反党集团余孽妄图借张铁娃之尸，还高岗之魂，为反党分子、大叛徒高岗树碑立传，这是白日作梦！
    影片还竭力把高岗的化身张铁娃打扮成一个人民革命武装的“创始人”。在黑《简史》中，吹捧高岗“从第一次国内革命战争，由于没有掌握武装而失败的惨痛教训中”，认识到“夺取武装”，“掌握武装斗争”的重要性；认识到“必须依靠农村山地，进行游击战争才是出路”。影片中则大写张铁娃和高飞虎来到常胜塬后，依靠仅有的一支手枪发展了浩浩荡荡的革命武装。当张铁娃来到刘大伯家里，这位老贫农满怀期望的心情说：“打仗的事……咱们都不会，没有领头的呀！”这时，张铁娃慷慨激昂地说：“乡亲们！我和飞虎同志到这里来就是要发动大家搞武装！”紧接着在“劫庙”一场中，张铁娃一枪打死恶霸地主、民团团总孙半原后，又立即以“救世主”的口吻呼喊道：“大家要过好日子，只有参加红军，组织起来，拿起刀枪，跟上共产党闹革命”。于是银幕上便立即出现了参加红军的人群，高举刀枪、长矛，云集在高岗的化身张铁娃的周围。
    炮制者安排了许多情节，又反复通过张铁娃之口大谈枪杆子，大谈武装斗争和游击战争。其目的就是妄图盗窃毛主席建立革命武装，开展游击战争，用枪杆子夺取政权的伟大理论和光辉实践，来美化叛徒高岗，以达到为高岗反党集团翻案，为反党集团的总后台中国赫鲁晓夫篡党、篡军、篡政制造反革命舆论的罪恶目的。但是，历史不容篡改，黑手遮不住太阳！中国人民革命武装的创始人是我们伟大领袖毛主席。是毛主席领导了秋收起义，创立了工农武装，接着，又在著名的“古田会议”上，对丰富的实践经验作了光辉的总结，亲自制定了红军的建军路线，批判了形形色色的资产阶级建军路线，从而使红军完全建立在马克思列宁主义的基础上，把马克思列宁主义的军事思想提高到一个崭新阶段。几十年来，在毛主席的光辉的无产阶级建军思想照耀下，我军从“星星之火”发展成“燎原”之势。过去依靠这支军队推翻了三座大山，夺取了政权；今天，这支军队又成为保卫社会主义革命和社会主义江山的伟大长城。这举世无双的伟大军队的缔造者是毛主席。历史就是铁的见证。高岗集团的几个反党小丑，妄图贪天之功，占为己有，那是痴心妄想！
    以《陕甘宁边区简史》的反动思想为“指导”，影片《红河激浪》还特地编造了高岗的化身张铁娃与“左”、右倾机会主义斗争的情节。
    在《红河激浪》的文学剧本中，他们别有用心地增加了一个“左”倾机会主义者特派员老朱。老朱主张“一齐动员”，“全线出击”，批评高岗的化身张铁娃是“逃跑主义”，“梢山主义”。张铁娃敢于坚持真理，和“左”倾盲动路线展开针锋相对的斗争。截粮战斗失败后，游击队员中有人产生了失败主义的右倾情绪，有人提出要“‘埋枪上塬’，‘个别串连群众’”，铁娃赶到之后立即纠正了这种右倾思想，“增强了大家的胜利信心……。”炮制者如此不惜工本地为反党头子高岗贴金，意在告诉观众：陕甘根据地早就有以高岗为代表的“正确”路线在和“左”右倾机会主义进行斗争了。这完全是高岗死党篡改历史的大骗局！只要翻开《陕甘宁边区简史》，我们就能发现，这不外是《陕甘宁边区简史》上所吹嘘的“高岗同志来到之后”，“坚持了正确的方向”，“不断地克服革命队伍中的右的失败主义思想和‘左’的急性病，使党的领导干部进一步认识了坚持农村游击战争和建立根据地的重要性”的翻版。其目的就是抹杀光焰无际的毛泽东思想，宣扬反党头子高岗是“唯一正确的路线”的代表。实际上高岗的一生，是罪恶的一生，反党的一生，他搞的全是“投降主义”、“流寇主义”，热衷的是“兵运路线”，占山为王，他是货真价实的老牌机会主义者。
    中国革命斗争的实践雄辩地证明，我们伟大领袖毛主席是中国无产阶级革命路线的创立者和代表者，毛泽东思想是放之四海而皆准的真理。当我们贯彻执行毛主席革命路线的时候，我们的事业就兴旺，当违背毛主席革命路线的时候，我们的事业就遭到挫折。反动影片《红河激浪》的炮制者竭力掩盖和抹煞这条红线，妄图以反党头子高岗的黑线取而代之，真是蚍蜉撼大树，可笑不自量！
    无产阶级文化大革命的春雷，震撼着祖国的大地；人民革命的暴风骤雨，荡涤着一切污垢。反党影片《红河激浪》是高岗反党集团的一面招魂幡，是中国赫鲁晓夫阴谋篡党、篡军、篡政的变天账。让我们高举起革命的批判旗帜，口诛笔伐，彻底清算高岗反党集团和他们的总后台中国赫鲁晓夫的滔天罪行，彻底肃清他们的一切流毒，让光焰无际的毛泽东思想，永远照耀全中国，照耀全世界！
