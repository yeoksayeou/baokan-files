The people of Jianchang County, Liaoning Province, under the guidance of the People's Liberation Army agricultural propaganda team, have been following the great leader Chairman Mao's instructions on the need for peasants to criticize the bourgeoisie. They have been holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, using the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines as their guiding principle, and persistently and deeply carrying out revolutionary criticism, achieving remarkable results.

Since April last year, the Jianchang County has been persistently carrying out revolutionary criticism. Based on the series of instructions from the great leader Chairman Mao, and in combination with the actual class struggle and production struggle in the county, they have planned and organized four waves of revolutionary criticism. Through persistent and deep revolutionary criticism, the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought in the county has been held higher and higher, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has been carried out more deeply, and people's spiritual outlook has undergone tremendous changes. They have thoroughly criticized the bourgeois "self" and established the proletarian "public," directing their thoughts and efforts towards socialism. In 1967, they achieved the great feat of increasing production by 35% across the county. Currently, both the revolutionary and spring plowing production situations are excellent.

How can the revolutionary criticism be carried out persistently and deeply? The Jianchang County has the following experiences:

	(1) Grasp living thoughts and first solve the problem of ideological understanding. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Mastering ideological education is the central link in uniting the whole party to carry out great political struggles." The PLA Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team, in response to the erroneous understandings and thoughts that have arisen in this team, such as "China's Khrushchev is far from us, criticizing him is useless," and "we have criticized enough, there is nothing left to criticize," helped the county to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, held bitter-sweet memory meetings and new-old society comparison meetings, and extensively discussed the class struggle situation and characteristics in the socialist revolutionary period; extensively discussed the great significance of persistently and deeply carrying out revolutionary criticism, which is related to whether to take the socialist road or the capitalist road; whether to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat or allow capitalism to restore; whether to carry the revolution through to the end or stop halfway. Through these series of work, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and community members have clearly recognized that China's Khrushchev is the greatest capitalist roader in China, the executioner of agricultural cooperativization, and the root cause of "three freedoms and one contract" and "four freedoms." Only by thoroughly criticizing him with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and eliminating his poisonous influence can we ensure that our socialist iron fortress will never change color.

	(2) Grasp the main contradiction and grasp the line of struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines. Chairman Mao teaches us: "When studying any process, if it is a complex process with more than two contradictions, one must use all efforts to find its main contradiction. Once the main contradiction is grasped, all problems will be solved." Some production teams in the Jianchang County, under the influence of China's Khrushchev advocating "three freedoms and one contract" and "four freedoms," have had some capitalist spontaneous tendencies. In the criticism, they firmly grasped this issue of two thoughts and two roads, and conducted extensive exposure and criticism of China's Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the party. Through exposure and criticism, the broad masses have recognized that among all poisons, the poison of China's Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionism is the greatest. They said: A few years ago, the capitalist spontaneous tendencies that grew up caused some cadres to change, and some community members also developed spontaneous tendencies. They automatically stopped the capitalist spontaneous tendencies, with everyone thinking of the big picture and every household thinking of the collective, and their thoughts and spiritual outlook have undergone significant changes.

	(3) Combine with the center of work in rural areas and continuously propose new topics. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Battles can only be fought one by one, and enemies can only be eliminated one part at a time." The revolutionary criticism in the Jianchang County is closely combined with the actual class struggle and production struggle in the local area, step by step deepening. During the spring plowing last year, they combined the situation of the two thoughts and two roads struggle in their team, through criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist poison of China's Khrushchev, extensively exposed the class struggle cover in their team; during the weeding period, they targeted China's Khrushchev's opposition to actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, "three freedoms and one contract," "four freedoms," "theory of the extinction of class struggle," "theory of public-private fusion," "theory of exploitation having merits," and other reactionary points, conducted thematic criticism, greatly improved the class consciousness of the broad community members, and greatly boosted revolutionary enthusiasm; after the autumn harvest last year, they again, according to Chairman Mao's latest instructions, criticized the bourgeois reactionary line, focusing on solving the problem of correctly handling the relationship between the state, collective, and individual, and correctly treating cadres; during this year's spring plowing, they again fiercely criticized the reactionary fallacies of "three freedoms and one contract," etc., established the thought of looking at the whole country and the world, quickly implemented the production plan, and launched a new high tide of spring plowing production. They are like this, step by step, a new topic, step by step, not leaving the big direction, the fire of revolutionary criticism burns brighter and brighter, and the great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought occupies the entire county.

	(4) Combine with the struggle against selfishness and criticism of revisionism, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois "self," and establish the proletarian "public." Chairman Mao teaches us: "The transformation of world outlook is a fundamental transformation." Through criticizing the revisionist poison and influence of China's Khrushchev's "three freedoms and one contract" and "four freedoms," the Jianchang County has launched a people's war from top to bottom to criticize selfishness and establish the public. The class consciousness of the broad community members has been greatly improved. They direct their efforts towards the collective and attach their hearts to the collective, and the revolution and production are getting better and better. The broad community members have deeply felt that the more fiercely they struggle against selfishness, the closer they are to Chairman Mao; the more fiercely they struggle against selfishness, the more they hate China's Khrushchev. Only by thoroughly overthrowing the "self," can we criticize revisionism in people's minds and establish an iron wall of "public."

    千万不要忘记阶级斗争。毛泽东
    毛泽东思想伟大红旗举得高  革命大批判的烈火烧得旺
    碱厂卜大队紧密结合本地阶级斗争实际，持久深入地开展革命大批判
      据新华社沈阳四日电　辽宁省本溪县山城子公社碱厂卜大队广大社员在人民解放军支农宣传队的帮助下，遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于农民也要批判资产阶级的伟大教导，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争为纲，坚持深入持久地开展革命大批判，取得了显著效果。
    碱厂卜大队从去年四月份以来，一直坚持开展革命的大批判。他们根据伟大领袖毛主席的一系列指示，结合本大队的阶级斗争和生产斗争的实际情况，有计划、有组织地先后掀起了四次革命大批判的高潮。通过深入持久地开展革命大批判，这个大队毛泽东思想伟大红旗越举越高，无产阶级文化大革命运动越搞越深，人的精神面貌发生了巨大变化。他们大破资产阶级
  “私”字，大立无产阶级“公”字，心往社会主义想，劲往社会主义使，一九六七年创造了全大队一年增产百分之三十五的巨大成果。目前，革命和春耕生产形势都很好。
    怎样才能把革命的大批判深入持久地开展下去呢？碱厂卜大队有以下几点体会：
      （一）抓住活思想，首先解决思想认识问题。毛主席教导我们：
  “掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。”解放军毛泽东思想宣传队针对这个队先后产生的“中国赫鲁晓夫离咱远，批判他，他也听不着，白费劲”，“批判得差不多了，再没有什么批判的了”等错误认识和思想，帮助大队办了毛泽东思想学习班，活学活用毛主席著作，召开了忆苦思甜、新旧社会对比会，大讲社会主义革命时期的阶级斗争形势和阶级斗争特点；大讲深入持久地开展革命大批判，是关系到走社会主义道路还是走资本主义道路；是巩固无产阶级专政还是让资本主义复辟；是将革命进行到底，还是半途而废的重大意义。经过这一系列工作，使广大贫下中农和社员清楚地认识到：中国赫鲁晓夫就是中国最大的走资派，是扼杀农业合作化的刽子手，是“三自一包”、“四大自由”的黑根子。只有用战无不胜的毛泽东思想予以彻底批判，并肃清他的流毒，才能保证我们的社会主义铁打江山永不变色。
      （二）抓住主要矛盾，抓住两个阶级、两条道路和两条路线斗争这个纲。毛主席教导我们：“研究任何过程，如果是存在着两个以上矛盾的复杂过程的话，就要用全力找出它的主要矛盾。捉住了这个主要矛盾，一切问题就迎刃而解了。”碱厂卜大队有的生产队，过去在中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“三自一包”、“四大自由”的影响下，有些人存在着资本主义自发倾向。在大批判中，他们狠狠地抓住了这个两种思想、两条道路问题，对中国赫鲁晓夫等党内一小撮走资派进行了大揭发、大批判。通过揭发、批判，使广大群众认识到，千毒万毒，中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义流毒，是最大的毒。他们说：前几年滋长的资本主义自发倾向，使有的干部变了，有的社员也滋长了自发倾向。他们自动地煞住了资本主义自发倾向，人人心怀大局，户户心向集体，思想、精神面貌发生了显著的变化。
      （三）和农村的各项中心工作相结合，不断提出新的课题。毛主席教导我们：“打仗只能一仗一仗地打，敌人只能一部分一部分地消灭。”碱厂卜大队的革命大批判，是紧密结合当地阶级斗争和生产斗争的实际，步步深入开展的。去年春耕期间，他们结合本队两种思想、两条道路斗争情况，通过狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义流毒，大揭了本队的阶级斗争盖子；夏锄期间，他们针对中国赫鲁晓夫反对活学活用毛主席著作、“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“公私融合论”、“剥削有功”等反动论点，进行了专题批判，大大地提高了广大社员的阶级觉悟，大鼓了革命干劲；去年秋收后，他们又根据毛主席的最新指示，批判了资产阶级反动路线，着重解决了正确处理国家、集体和个人三者关系和正确对待干部问题；今年春耕时，他们又狠批了“三自一包”等反动谬论，树立了放眼全国，胸怀世界的思想，迅速地落实了生产规划，掀起了春耕生产新高潮。他们就是这样一步一个新课题，步步不离大方向，革命大批判的烈火越烧越旺，伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想占领了全大队。
      （四）和斗私批修相结合，大破资产阶级“私”字，大立无产阶级“公”字。毛主席教导我们：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。碱厂卜大队通过狠批中国赫鲁晓夫“三自一包”、“四大自由”等修正主义流毒和影响，从上到下，打了一场破私立公的“人民战争”。广大社员阶级觉悟有了很大提高。他们把劲使在集体上，把心贴在集体上，革命和生产搞得越来越好。广大社员深有体会地说：斗私越狠，对毛主席越亲；斗私越狠，对中国赫鲁晓夫越恨。只有彻底斗倒“私”字，才能在人的头脑里批臭修正主义，树立起“公”字的钢铁长城。
