    Planting Flowers
　　Qin Wen
    "Intentionally planting flowers, they don't bloom; unintentionally planting willows, they thrive."

    This illustrates that willows are one of the easiest plants to grow. Regarding willows, ancient books state: "Even if planted upside down, they will live; if broken and planted, they will also live." However, it continues: "But if ten people plant them, and one person pulls them up, there will be no willows." Although willows are easy to grow, they must take root in the soil. If they are not allowed to take root, even if planted in the ground, constantly pulling them up to look, like monkeys planting trees, they will not survive.

    Plant reproduction, whether from seeds, germination, branching, leaf growth, flowering, and fruiting, all have a specific process. For cuttings, whether roses or rosebushes, you must choose those that are neither too old nor too tender, cut them not too long nor too short, remove the leaves, water them regularly, place them in a location with neither too much sun nor too much shade, and it must be done during the rainy seasons of spring and autumn. Similarly, for layering osmanthus, you must wait until the new branches have grown their own roots before severing them from the mother tree; all have a specific process. But my two children have both planted flowers in this way: they would break off rose blossoms one by one and "plant" them on the ground. Immediately after planting, they would appear red and beautiful. After planting them, they would clap their little hands, very pleased with themselves. I told them that flowers planted in this way would not live, but they didn't believe me. Anyway, after a day or two, the flowers wilted, and they had already forgotten about it. This kind of planting is less about being clever and more about being innocent and naive. It's fine for three- or four-year-old children to play this way, but real flowers will never bloom; it's impossible to achieve a "hundred flowers blooming" this way.

    Adults also do things like this, which is called "trying to help seedlings grow by pulling them up." Mencius records: "There was a man of Song who worried that his seedlings were not growing and pulled them up. Wearily, he returned home and told his family, 'I am exhausted today. I helped the seedlings grow.' His son rushed to look at them, and the seedlings were withered." Without understanding the growth process of seedlings, relying only on subjective wishes, thinking that pulling them upwards would make them grow quickly. Working hard, "not only is it useless, but it is also harmful." Isn't this the result of a subjective work style?

    The practice of "trying to help seedlings grow by pulling them up" still exists today. Folk art, whether music or dance, is always relatively rough and immature, but within the roughness there is refinement, spirit, freedom, and boldness. Precisely because it is immature, it is novel; immature today, it will mature in the future. Art must be continuously improved through activity and should not be forced. But some people, just to rush something to the stage, for programs with a relatively good foundation, instead of first popularizing them, immediately make major deletions and revisions, thinking they are good at processing, but the result is ruining the program. A young writer's achievement also has its own specific process. Lu Xun always told young writers to pay attention to all sorts of things, to see more; he advised those learning to write novels to first write some essays and casual talks. When he corrected articles for young people, he only deleted and revised a few words or sentences, or circled a few words, mainly to explain the principles, allowing the authors to think and correct themselves. Now, some people who are "promoting creation" simply take the writings of ordinary young people, delete large chunks, and write large chunks for them, publish them in journals, and publish them as separate books, giving people the feeling that "reaching the sky in a single bound" is possible. But it is difficult to sustain, and the result is often a lack of independent thinking and an inevitable fall into the path of "imitation" and "plagiarism."

    "Intentionally planting flowers, they don't bloom; unintentionally planting willows, they thrive!" This also shows that the development of things has its own specific laws and processes, which cannot be achieved solely by anyone's subjective wishes.

    种花

    “有意种花花不开，无心插柳柳成行。”
    这说明杨柳在植物中是容易种植的一种。对于杨柳，古书上又有这样的话：“倒树之亦生，折而树之又生。”可是接下去是这样说的：“然使十人树之，而使一人拔之，则无杨矣。”杨柳虽然容易生长，可是必须在土壤里生根。如果不让长根，虽然插在地里，可是常常拔起来看，所谓猢狲种树，也是不会活的。
    植物繁殖，或者由种子，发芽，抽枝，长叶，开花，结实，总有一定的过程。插枝，无论玫瑰，蔷薇，都要挑得不太老不太嫩的，剪得不太长不太短，删掉叶子，随时灌水，放在阳光不多也不太阴暗的地方，还得在春秋二季多雨的时候进行；像桂花的压条，要到新枝已另生根才可以和母树断绝关系，也都有一定的过程。可是我的两个孩子，都曾经这样种过花，就是把蔷薇花一朵朵地折得到地面上来种；一种下去就红粉粉地显得很美丽。种好以后拍拍小手掌，得意得很。我告诉他们这样种的花不会活，他们还不相信；反正一两天以后花谢枝干，他们已经忘却了。这样的种花，与其说是自作聪明，不如说是天真幼稚。这在三、四岁的孩子作为玩耍无妨，可是真正的花朵永远开不起来；要这样来百花齐放是不行的。
    成人也有这样的事情，所谓揠苗助长。“孟子”的书上有这样的记载，“宋人有闵其苗之不长而揠之者，芒芒然归，谓其人曰：今日病矣，予助苗长矣。其子趋而往视之，苗则槁矣。”不了解苗的生长过程，只凭主观愿望，以为用力往上拔起，就会迅速成长。辛辛苦苦，“非徒无益，而又害之。”这不是主观主义作风的结果么？
    “揠苗助长”的事情现在还有：民间艺术，无论音乐，舞蹈，总是比较的粗，不成熟的，可是粗中有细，有气魄，不拘束，豪放；正因为不成熟，这才新颖；今天不成熟，将来会成熟。艺术要在活动中不断提高，不应该强迫。可是有人，只是为着急需什么上演，对于基础相当好的节目，不先使之普及，却即大加删改，自以为善于加工，结果是糟蹋了这节目。一个青年作家的成就，也有其一定的过程。鲁迅先生对于青年作家，总是叫他留心各样的事情，多看看；劝学写小说的先写些杂感、杂谈。他给青年批改文章，也只删改少数字句，或者勾动几个字，主要的是说明道理，让作者自己去思考、改正。现在有人“繁荣创作”，只是把一般青年的文字拿来大块地删去，大块地代为写上，登上刊物，并出单本，使人有“一步登天”可以侥幸之感。可是后难为继，其结果往往是缺少独立思考力量，难免误入“摹仿”、“抄袭”歧途。
    “有意种花花不开，无心插柳柳成行！”这也说明了事物的发展有其一定的规律和过程，不是只凭谁的主观愿望可以做到的。
