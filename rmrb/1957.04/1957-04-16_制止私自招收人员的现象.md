According to reports from supervisory and labor departments in Beijing, Fujian, and other places, some government agencies and enterprises, disregarding the overall interests of the nation, are still privately recruiting personnel after the State Council issued the "Notice on Stopping the Increase of Institutions and Expansion of Staffing in State Organs." After discovering the above-mentioned violations of national laws and regulations during inspections, supervisory and labor departments have reported them to the relevant leading authorities and issued circulars to stop them. This is entirely necessary and correct.

Oversized institutions, excessive staffing, and too many personnel are common phenomena in many government agencies and enterprises today. The existence of this phenomenon not only increases national expenditure and wastes a large amount of manpower and resources but also fosters bureaucracy in the work of government agencies and enterprises, which is detrimental to our socialist cause. In order to change this unreasonable and harmful phenomenon, the Party and the state, in addition to instructing all localities to conscientiously and systematically streamline institutions and rectify staffing, have also issued a "Notice on Stopping the Increase of Institutions and Expansion of Staffing in State Organs" by the State Council. The reason why the Party and the state are taking such measures is that if the arbitrary establishment of institutions and recruitment of personnel by government agencies and enterprises are not stopped during the streamlining and reorganization, it will not only be impossible to achieve the purpose of streamlining and reorganization, but it will inevitably lead to increasingly large institutions and more and more personnel, bringing greater difficulties to future work. This principle is extremely clear. However, some government agencies and enterprises still disregard national laws and regulations and continue to privately recruit personnel, even sending out recruitment teams everywhere, as long as they feel there is a "need" in their work, especially as long as they feel it is convenient and easy for themselves. This departmentalist thinking is obviously wrong.

Of course, because the situation of institutions and personnel staffing in various government agencies and enterprises is unbalanced, some government agencies and enterprises still need to increase some personnel even during the implementation of the State Council's notice. However, to increase personnel, the first step is to resolve it through adjustments among various localities and systems; only when internal adjustments cannot solve the problem should recruitment be reported to the leading authorities for approval. The advantage of doing so is that it makes it easier for the leading authorities to have a unified grasp of the situation of staffing and personnel, so that the abnormal phenomenon of one government agency streamlining personnel while another is recruiting personnel will not occur. However, some government agencies and enterprises in Beijing, Fujian, and other places have recruited personnel privately without the approval of the leading authorities. This shows that their organizational concept is very weak, and it is also doubtful whether they really need to increase personnel. Therefore, it is necessary to inspect and deal with such incidents. Only in this way can we enforce national discipline and effectively curb this kind of phenomenon.

    制止私自招收人员的现象
    应麟
    据北京、福建等地监察、劳动部门的反映，在国务院发出“关于国家机关停止增设机构扩大编制的通知”以后，有一些机关和企业不顾国家的整体利益，仍在私自招收人员。监察、劳动部门在检查发现上述违反国家法令的现象后，已经报请有关的领导机关通令制止，这是完全必要的和正确的。
    机构臃肿、编制过大和人员过多，这是当前许多机关和企业普遍的现象。这种现象的存在，不仅增加了国家经费的开支，浪费了大量的人力物力；而且助长了机关企业工作中的官僚主义，不利于我们的社会主义事业。为了改变这种不合理的、有害的现象，党和国家除已指示各地必须认真地和有计划地精简机构和整顿编制以外，还由国务院发出了“关于国家机关停止增设机构扩大编制的通知”。党和国家所以要采取这样的措施、是因为在精简整编的同时，如果不制止机关、企业随意增设机构和招收人员，就不但不可能达到精简整编的目的；而且必然使得机构愈来愈庞大，人员愈来愈多，给今后的工作带来更大的困难。这个道理是极为明白的。但是，仍然有些机关和企业只要感到工作上有“需要”，特别是只要自己觉得方便和顺手，就置国家的法令于不顾，仍然在私自招收人员，甚至派出招聘组四出招聘。这种本位主义的思想显然是错误的。
    当然，由于各机关和企业机构和人员编制的情况是不平衡的，就是在贯彻执行国务院通知的期间，有些机关和企业仍然需要增加一些人员。但是，增加人员，首先要在各地方和各系统之间调剂解决；只有在内部无法调剂解决的时候，才应报请领导机关批准招收人员。这样做的好处是便于领导机关统一掌握编制和人员的情况，而不致出现这个机关在精简人员、那个机关在招收人员的反常现象。但是，北京、福建等地的一些机关和企业并没有经过领导机关批准，就私自在那里招收人员。这表明它们的组织观念十分薄弱，同时它们是不是真正需要增加人员，也是值得怀疑的。因此，有必要对这类事件加以检查处理。只有这样，才能严肃国家的政纪，有效地制止这类现象。
