Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, April 13th: The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently convened a province-wide propaganda work conference, deciding to continue and deepen the socialist ideological propaganda movement throughout the province in order to correctly handle contradictions among the people.

    The conference conveyed Chairman Mao Zedong's speech at the Supreme State Conference on the correct handling of contradictions among the people. The cadres present fully discussed the speech in connection with the ideological situation of the masses in the province. The cadres clarified the nature, specific manifestations, causes, and methods for correctly resolving contradictions among the people; and clarified that the saying that "Shanxi Province, as an old revolutionary base area, has a good work foundation, and the people have a high level of awareness, so there are no internal contradictions" is wrong. The conference also criticized the erroneous saying that contradictions among the people are excessively sharp, everything is a problem, and it is difficult to handle things solely through persuasion and education. It was also pointed out that the views that people's democratic dictatorship and the methods of class analysis and the class line are no longer needed in the future are incorrect. The conference clarified these thoughts, thereby enabling the cadres present to realize the necessity and importance of strengthening political and ideological work, improving leadership, and expanding democratic life in the future.

    The conference believed that the socialist ideological propaganda movement launched in Shanxi Province at the end of February is an important measure for correctly handling contradictions among the people. Currently, this movement has been widely launched throughout the province. In some schools, factories, government offices, and agricultural cooperatives, the method of combining positive propaganda and promoting democracy has achieved good results in educating the masses and improving leadership. However, most units have only paid attention to positive propaganda, neglecting the promotion of democracy, and some have even unilaterally regarded the propaganda movement only as a criticism of the masses' erroneous thoughts, without examining the leadership or improving work, which has resulted in poor results. The conference stipulated that this movement must improve the people's awareness, overcome bureaucracy, and further strengthen the ties between the Party and the people through strengthening ideological education and expanding democracy, and promote this year's increase production and thrift movement and agricultural bumper harvest movement. The conference also required that all rural areas, factories, schools, and government offices regularize and institutionalize political and ideological work after the end of the movement. Secretaries of Party committees at all levels and principal leaders of various systems must personally ensure the healthy development of the socialist ideological propaganda movement.

    The conference also discussed issues such as the enrollment and employment of this year's graduates from senior primary schools and secondary schools, and the resettlement of demobilized soldiers.

    中共山西省委宣传工作会议作出决定
    开展社会主义思想宣传运动
    据新华社太原13日电　中共山西省委员会最近召开全省宣传工作会议，决定在全省范围内继续深入地开展社会主义思想的宣传运动，以正确处理人民内部的矛盾。
    这次会议传达了毛泽东主席在最高国务会议上作的关于正确地处理人民内部矛盾问题的讲话。到会干部联系全省人民群众的思想状况进行了充分的讨论。干部们明确了人民内部矛盾的性质、具体表现、形成的原因和正确地解决矛盾的方法；明确了某些人认为“山西省老区工作基础好，人民群众觉悟高，不存在什么内部矛盾”的说法是错误的。会议还批判了有些人认为人民内部矛盾过分尖锐、一切都成了问题、只靠说服教育不好办事的错误说法。并且指出，认为今后不再需要人民民主专政和阶级分析的方法、阶级路线的观点都是不对的。会议澄清了这些思想，从而使到会干部认识到今后加强政治思想工作、改善领导和扩大民主生活的必要和重要。
    会议认为，山西省在2月底展开的社会主义思想的宣传运动，就是正确处理人民内部矛盾的一项重要措施。目前这个运动已经在全省范围内普遍展开。在一部分学校、工厂、机关和农业社里，采取正面宣传和发扬民主相结合的办法，已经取得了教育群众和改进领导的良好效果。但是大多数单位只注意了正面的宣传，忽视了发扬民主，有的甚至把宣传运动片面地只看作批评群众的错误思想，而不去检查领导、改进工作，这样就收效较差。会议规定，这一运动必须通过加强思想教育和扩大民主的方法，以提高人民群众的觉悟，克服官僚主义，进一步密切党和人民群众的联系，推动今年的增产节约运动和农业丰产运动。会议还要求所有农村、工厂、学校、机关都要在运动结束以后把政治思想工作经常化、制度化。各级党委的书记和各系统的主要领导人员都要亲自动手使社会主义思想的宣传运动健康的开展。
    会议还对今年高小、中学毕业生的升学就业问题，对复员军人的安置等问题进行了讨论。
