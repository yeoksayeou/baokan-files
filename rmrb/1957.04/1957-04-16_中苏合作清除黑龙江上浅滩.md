    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 14th - According to Soviet newspaper reports: In the Heilongjiang River bed within the Lesser Khingan mountain gorge region, since the winter of last year, explosions have been continuously heard. Chinese and Soviet workers and technicians are clearing shoals here. Up to now, on approximately six thousand square meters of the river surface, the riverbed has been deepened by an average of one meter.
    Originally, the Heilongjiang River's riverbed was mostly deep, with only a section of about three kilometers long flowing through the Lesser Khingan mountain gorge region having many shoals at the bottom, obstructing navigation. Chinese and Soviet experts jointly formulated a plan to clear this section of shoals last year. The project began last winter.
    It is expected that the entire shoal will be completely cleared in two years. At that time, even during the dry season, large ships will be able to navigate the entire length of the Heilongjiang River.

    中苏合作清除黑龙江上浅滩
    新华社莫斯科14日电　据苏联报纸消息：在小兴安岭峡谷地区的黑龙江河床上，从去年冬季开始，不断地响着爆破声。中国和苏联工人和技术人员在这里清除浅滩，到现在为止，在约六千平方公尺的河面上，河床平均加深了一公尺。
    原来黑龙江绝大部分河床都比较深，只有在流经小兴安岭峡谷地区的约三公里长的一段，河底有许多浅滩阻碍航行。中苏两国专家去年共同拟定了清除这段浅滩的方案。去年冬季工程就展开了。
    预计两年以后，整个浅滩就能够完全清除。那时，即使在枯水季节，大轮船也可以在黑龙江上全线通航。
