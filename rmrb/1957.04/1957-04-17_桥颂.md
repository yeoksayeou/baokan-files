　　Ode to the Bridge
　　Zhang Xiaohu

　　On this Earth, the people who invent and build bridges are the most worthy of our respect.

　　Roads are made by people walking on them; bridges are built by people. Where there are roads, bridges must be built, and walking also requires crossing bridges. Although shallow water can be crossed by wading and large rivers can be crossed by boat, it is only when humanity has invented and built many bridges that roads become easier to travel, roads become more closely connected, and the material and cultural exchange of mankind becomes more unimpeded. There is a foreign saying, "All roads lead to Rome"; we now often say, "All roads lead to communism." This is certainly correct. However, I often think that if we do not build thousands of bridges, large and small, on these long and arduous roads, we will still not be able to reach our destination smoothly. Therefore, just as we must walk, we must also build and cross bridges.

　　Building bridges is a huge labor. The people who build bridges are often some nameless laborers. From ancient times to the present, there are as many roads as there are bridges, and countless people have labored for them, but how many well-known bridge builders are there? Historically, we know that there was Li Chun in the Sui Dynasty and Huai Bing in the Song Dynasty; in modern times, many people may know Mao Yisheng. They are truly few and far between. In fact, those famous and nameless bridge builders are worthy of gratitude from us bridge crossers.

　　Those who use their lives to build revolutionary bridges are especially worthy of our respect and gratitude. Anyone who has seen the color woodcut "Human Bridge" and the oil painting "The Red Army Flies Across the Luding Bridge" cannot help but be moved by that kind of fighting spirit. In Ehrenburg's novel "The Storm," he describes a Soviet officer named Sergei who is full of patriotism and internationalism. He was originally a bridge engineer, and in the army he was also an engineer—building bridges for the advancing army. He loved building bridges the most, and he firmly believed that "the most beautiful thing in the world is the bridge—it makes one era cross to another." This was his belief. The revolution has crossed the bridges built by these comrades, advancing from victory to victory. These bridges built with noble lives—the bridges of socialism, the bridges of Marxism-Leninism, the bridges of patriotism and internationalism—will forever stand on the road of human progress, leading us from backwardness to progress, from today to tomorrow, from socialism to communism.

　　The Communist Party leads the Chinese people, has crossed many bridges, is now crossing bridges, and will cross many bridges in the future. Our destination is communism. To reach this destination, we must travel a long road and cross many bridges. We have crossed the bridge of democratic revolution, and also crossed the bridge of socialist revolution; crossed the bridge of land reform, and also crossed the bridge of agricultural cooperation; large bridges and small bridges, long bridges and short bridges; flat bridges and difficult bridges; we have already crossed quite a few. Crossing the bridge of revolution is not as easy as crossing an ordinary bridge; it has gone through serious struggles, but we have finally crossed them all. And now, what is displayed in front of us is a new bridge—the bridge of socialist construction. Only after crossing this bridge can we move from poverty to prosperity, from an agricultural country to an industrial country.

　　The Communist Party leads the Chinese people, has built many bridges, is now building bridges, and will build many bridges in the future. Our predecessors have built many bridges for us, and many good bridges can still be used today. The methods of bridge building by our predecessors have also been passed down a lot, and some can still be used today. However, more and larger bridges need to be built by our generation; and faster and better bridge-building methods still need to be constantly created by us. The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge is an ideal of thousands of generations of people, and it can only be realized today. And the bridge of revolutionary victory, the bridge of socialist construction, is an even more massive project with even more magnificent spirit, requiring the joint efforts of the people of the whole country. Crossing the bridge is not easy, but building the bridge is even more difficult, and building the bridge of socialism is even more difficult. The future is bright, but rivers block the road. To reach the other shore from this shore, and to allow large teams to pass through, we must "build bridges when encountering water." Moreover, general pontoon bridges will not work; we need modern large iron bridges. This is truly hopeful but also difficult.

　　Roads cannot be finished walking; bridges cannot be finished building. Building a bridge requires labor; after crossing the bridge, you can get happiness. Being a bridge crosser is happy; being a bridge builder is glorious; and being willing to become an anonymous bridge, letting others cross over and move towards a wider road, is especially a great idea. In Pavlenko's novel "Happiness," the heroine Lena, on a beautiful night, facing the roads and bridges, recalled the "selfless efforts of those anonymous builders," which is very inspiring. She "thought about how long life is and how boundless it is. Look at that lifeless cliff, but it contains someone's life. Look at that gurgling stream, maybe it is the trace of life excavated by a stubborn iron hoe. And the bridge they just passed also means someone's immortal spirit. And this road, these pine trees, and the springs by the road—these are all human lives." Therefore, she "suddenly wanted to turn herself into a small piece of land as if craving happiness," and in the future, maybe someone will also "recall their nameless predecessors with gentle love and admiration." And today, we need such nameless pioneers to build the great bridge of socialism, so that our children and grandchildren can cross this bridge and move towards the bright future of communism!

### 桥颂

　　桥颂
　　张啸虎
    在地球上，发明桥和建造桥的人们，是最值得我们尊敬的。
    路，是人走出来的；桥，是人造起来的。有路就必须造桥，走路也必须过桥。虽然浅水可以涉足而过，大河可以乘船而过；但是，只有当人类发明了并且建造了许多座桥梁之后，路才更加好走了，路与路之间才更加紧密地携起手来了，而人类物质的和文化的交流也更加畅通无阻了。外国有一句俗话说：“条条道路通罗马”；我们现在又常说：“条条道路通向共产主义”。这当然是对的。不过，我常常想，如果我们不在这些漫长而艰难的道路上架设起千万座大小桥梁的话，我们还是不能顺利地到达目的地的。所以说，正像我们必须走路一样，我们也必须造桥和过桥。
    造桥，这是一种巨大的劳动。造桥的人，很多是一些无名的劳动者。从古至今，有多少条路，就有多少座桥，就付出了不知多少人的劳动，而知名的造桥者又有几个？历史上，我们知道隋朝有一个李春，宋朝有一个怀丙；在当代，可能有不少人知道有一个茅以升。真是屈指可数。其实那些有名的和无名的造桥者都是值得我们过桥者感激的。
    用生命来架设革命的桥的人，尤其值得我们尊敬和感激。看过彩色木刻“人桥”和油画“红军飞越泸定桥”的人，谁都不能不为那种战斗精神所感动。爱伦堡的长篇小说“暴风雨”里，描写了一位极富爱国主义和国际主义精神的苏联军官赛琪。他原来是一位桥梁工程师，在军队里也当的是工兵——为前进的军队架设桥梁。他最爱造桥，他坚决相信：世界上“最美丽的东西就是桥——它使一个时代跨越到另一个时代”。这就是他的信念。革命，就是跨过了这些同志所架设起来的桥，从胜利走向胜利的。这些用高贵生命所架设起来的桥梁——社会主义的桥梁，马克思列宁主义的桥梁，爱国主义与国际主义的桥梁，将永远屹立在人类前进的斗争道路上，使我们从落后跨向进步，从今天跨向明天，从社会主义跨向共产主义。
    共产党领导着中国人民，已经过了不少的桥，现在也正在过桥，今后还要过不少的桥。我们的目的地是共产主义，到达这个目的地，要走漫长的路，要过许多的桥。我们过了民主主义革命的桥，也过了社会主义革命的桥；过了土地改革的桥，也过了农业合作化的桥；大桥小桥，长桥短桥；平坦的桥和艰难的桥；我们已经过的不少了。过革命的桥可不像平常过桥那样便当，是经过了严重斗争的，但总算都过来了。而现在，展示在我们面前的却是一座新的桥——社会主义建设的桥。跨过了这座桥以后，才能从贫穷走向富强，从农业国走向工业国。
      共产党领导着中国人民，已经造了不少的桥，现在也正在造桥，今后还要造很多的桥。前人给我们造的桥已经不少了，有许多好桥到现在还能用。前人造桥的方法也流传得很多，有的到现在也还能利用。但是，更多更大的桥，要在我们这一代造成；而更快更好的建桥方法，尚有待我们不断的创造。像武汉长江大桥就是千百代人民的理想，只有到今天才能实现。而革命胜利的桥，社会主义建设的桥，工程更浩大，气魄更雄伟，需要全国人民的共同努力。过桥不易，造桥尤难，造社会主义之桥更难。前途似锦，但是江河阻路。要从此岸到达彼岸，要让大队通过，就非“遇水搭桥”不可。而且一般浮桥还不行，非现代化的大铁桥不可。这真是有希望也有困难。
    路，是走不完的；桥，是造不完的。造起桥来，需要付出劳动；过了桥后，就能得到幸福。做一个过桥的人，是快乐的；做一个造桥的人，是光荣的；而愿意自己成为一座无名的桥，让别人跨过去，走向宽阔的道路，则尤其是一种伟大的思想。巴夫连柯的小说“幸福”里的女主角列娜，在一个幽美的夜，对着道路，对着桥梁，追想起那些“无名建设家的大公无私的努力”，很有启发。她“想到人生是怎样漫长，怎样没有边际。瞧那个没有生命的断崖，它却包含着什么人的生命。瞧那个潺潺不息的溪流，也许它是一把顽强的铁锄所开掘出来的生命的痕迹。而他们刚经过的那座桥，也意味着什么人的不朽精神。还有这条道路，这些松树，以及路畔的泉水——这些全都是人的生命”。因此，她“突然像渴望幸福似的想把自己变成一小块土地”，在将来也许有人同样“怀着温柔的爱和羡慕之情，回忆着自己无名的先驱者”。而我们今天，正是需要这样一些无名的先驱者，来建造社会主义的大桥，让我们的子孙跨过这座桥去，走向共产主义的锦绣前程！
