    Agricultural Curiosities

    A Loofah of Nine Feet Nine Inches
    Sun Zhenhe, Director of the Shijiazhuang Special District Agricultural Bureau in Hebei Province, and comrades such as Gu Ziming cultivated loofahs that produced an average of more than forty catties per plant, with each loofah reaching a length of nine feet nine inches or more. Liang Shaokang, an agricultural technician from the bureau, is currently collecting some seeds to send to agricultural universities and scientific research institutions across the country for trial planting.

    A Sweet Potato Weighing Sixteen and a Half Catties
    Yaohua Agricultural Cooperative in Hengshui County, Hebei Province, is famous for growing sweet potatoes. Last November, this agricultural cooperative sent a large sweet potato weighing a full sixteen and a half catties to participate in the agricultural exhibition held in Shijiazhuang area.
    This large sweet potato is of the "Victory No. 100" variety, with abundant flesh, sweet taste, and high yield, averaging over 12,000 catties per mu. (Liang Zhaobin)

    河北省石家庄专区农业局孙振河局长和古子明等同志共同培植的丝瓜，每棵平均产四十斤还多，每条丝瓜长达九尺九以上。现该局农业技术员梁少康同志正搜集一部分种子寄往全国各农业大学与科学试验研究机关试种。
