Xinhua News Agency, New York, April 17th: Egyptian representative to the United Nations, Loutfi, wrote to the President of the Security Council on the 15th, accusing Israel of continuing to take border provocation actions against Egypt.

The letter points out that recently, Israeli troops have repeatedly crossed the Egyptian-Israeli armistice line to attack Egyptian residents in the Gaza Strip and plunder their property. Israeli planes have also repeatedly crossed the border to fly over towns in the Gaza Strip. The letter says that these facts should be regarded as a prelude to new actions of terror and atrocities by Israel.

Xinhua News Agency, New York, April 17th: A spokesman for the Egyptian delegation to the United Nations condemned on April 15th the attempt by Western countries to submit the Suez Canal issue to the United Nations Security Council as an attempt to put pressure on Egypt.

The Egyptian delegation spokesman said that these reports are "propaganda probes" aimed at putting pressure on Egypt, with the purpose of making Egypt concede to Western countries in the current negotiations with the United States, otherwise, the negotiations will be interrupted.

The spokesman refuted the Western countries' claim that Egypt's refusal to allow Israeli ships to navigate the canal is a violation of the 1888 Convention, saying that Egypt's responsibility is not only to defend its own security but also to defend the security of the user countries. That is why it cannot allow enemy countries' ships to use the canal.

    埃及谴责以色列越境寻衅
    指斥西方想把运河问题提交安理会
    据新华社17日讯　纽约消息：埃及驻联合国代表卢特菲15日写信给安全理事会主席，指责以色列继续对埃及采取边境挑衅行动。
    信中指出，最近以来，以色列军队曾经多次越过以—埃停战线袭击加沙地区的埃及居民和掠夺他们的财产，以色列的飞机也多次越境在加沙地区的城镇上空飞行。信中说，这些事实应该被认为是以色列采取恐怖和暴行的新行动的前奏。
    据新华社17日讯　纽约消息：埃及驻联合国代表团发言人4月15日谴责西方国家企图把苏伊士运河问题提交联合国安全理事会是想要对埃及施加压力。
    埃及代表团发言人说，这些消息是企图对埃及施加压力的“宣传性试探”，其目的是使埃及在目前同美国进行的谈判中向西方国家让步，否则就使谈判中断。
    发言人驳斥西方国家提出的埃及不让以色列船只在运河通航是破坏1888年公约的说法，他说，埃及的责任不仅是保卫他自己的安全，而且也保卫使用国的安全。这就是为什么它不能容许敌国的船只使用运河的原因。
