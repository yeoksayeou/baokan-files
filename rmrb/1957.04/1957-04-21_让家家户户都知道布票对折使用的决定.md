    Let Every Household Know About the Decision to Use Cloth Coupons at Half Value
    (Our dispatch) Beijing, Tianjin, Wuhan, Jilin and other places are widely and deeply publicizing the State Council's method of halving the supply of cotton cloth to workers and the masses; some places, because the cotton cloth supply certificates were not used in installments, have already begun to implement the halving of supply on April 20.
    Beijing
    On the 19th, the Beijing Municipal People's Committee held a plenary meeting of its members, deciding that from May 1st, all retail units will resume purchasing goods with cloth coupons and the marriage subsidy for cloth will be reduced by a quarter. The meeting also required sales units to strictly control public cloth. The method of halving the supply of cotton cloth will be widely publicized throughout the city.
    Tianjin
    The Tianjin Municipal People's Committee has determined that the city's cotton cloth supply this year will be reduced by 655,000 bolts compared to last year. Among them, the reduction in the supply of civilian cloth is 230,000 bolts; the rest is saved from strengthening the recycling of flour sacks, improving packaging, and industrial cloth and equipment cloth for organizations.
    In order to ensure the winter clothing needs of the citizens, the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee decided to vigorously call on citizens to renovate old clothes, resize large clothes to small; promote the adjustment and use of cloth purchase certificates among residents; and require the clothing sewing industry to widely carry out the business of renovating and altering old clothes, and actively research and improve cutting methods to save cotton cloth.

    Wuhan
    In recent days, the people of Wuhan have been writing letters to the "Yangtze River Daily," expressing their determination to wear what they have, mend what they can, and vigorously save cotton cloth.
    Wuhan model worker Wang Qun wrote: Textile workers are now thinking of various ways to save cotton, spin more cotton yarn, and weave more cotton cloth. Housewife Li Chunpei also wrote a letter saying: In the homes of residents, there are always a few old clothes in the closet, so she suggested that housewives should first clean out the bottom of the closet when calculating seasonal clothes, wear the old clothes that can be worn, alter the ones that can be altered, and mend the broken ones. Unless urgently needed, do not add new clothes. Li Yiming, a salesperson at the Central Sales Department of the Wuhan Department Store, said in a letter that he often encounters some customers who did not intend to buy cloth, but bought it casually because they saw new patterns of cloth. Li Yiming believes that cloth that can be bought or not should be saved for those who really need it.
    The "Yangtze River Daily" published these letters and successively received many letters from the masses, responding to the suggestion of saving cotton cloth.
    They suggested that public opinion should criticize the idea of comparing each other's good clothes and thinking that it is not glorious to wear mended clothes; on the other hand, they should also wear what they have, such as those who have old suits can also wear suits, without having to make new clothes. Many readers also demanded to resolutely compress the public cloth such as curtains and tablecloths that are massively added by the organs and units in order to pay attention to pomp.
    (According to Xinhua News Agency)
    Jilin
    The Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has issued instructions to lower-level party committees, requiring all localities to do a good job in publicizing the halving of cotton cloth supply. The publicity work is being carried out in various places.
    After investigating the use of public cloth, the Changchun Municipal Cotton Cloth Supply Department has decided to reduce the original supply of 3.8 million feet to 3 million feet. After hearing the publicity on saving cloth, many factory workers and street residents have expressed that they will add less or no clothes this year.
    Lanzhou
    On the morning of the 19th, the party and government leaders of Lanzhou City conveyed the method of halving the supply of cotton cloth to the staff and workers of various agencies and enterprises, and implemented the new method of purchasing cloth from April 20.
    Xinxiang
    Xinxiang City, Henan Province, began to implement the method of halving the supply of cotton cloth on April 20. The party and government leaders of Xinxiang City attach great importance to this work and are currently publicizing it to the broad masses. The Xinxiang market is very stable after the implementation of the cloth coupon doubling, and consumers generally reflect that the halved supply has little impact on summer clothes.

    让家家户户都知道布票对折使用的决定
    本报讯　北京、天津、武汉、吉林等地，为执行国务院关于棉布折半供应的办法，正在广泛向职工和群众进行深入宣传；有些地方由于棉布供应证没有分期使用，已经在4月20日开始实行折半供应。
    北京
    19日，北京市人民委员会召开了全体委员会议，决定从5月1日起，凡零售单位一律恢复凭布票进货和结婚补助用布减少四分之一。会议并要求销售单位严格控制公用布。棉布折半供应的办法将在全市广泛进行宣传。
    天津
    天津市人民委员会确定今年全市棉布供应量比去年节约六十五万五千匹。其中，减少供应的民用布有二十三万匹；其余是从加强面袋回收、改进包装等工业用布和机关、团体的设备用布中节约下来的。
    天津市人民委员会为了保证市民的冬衣需要，决定大力号召市民对原有衣着拆旧翻新、剪大改小；提倡居民对购布证的调剂使用；要求服装缝纫行业广泛开展翻改旧衣业务，积极研究改进裁剪方法，以节约棉布。　　（据新华社）
    武汉
    武汉市人民群众最近几天纷纷写信给“长江日报”，表示决心做到有啥穿啥，能补就补，大力节约棉布。
    武汉市劳动模范王群写道：纺织工人现在正在想各种办法节约棉花纺出更多的棉纱、织出更多的棉布。家庭主妇李春培也写信说：住家的人家，箱子里总有件把破旧衣服，因此她建议家庭主妇们在计算换季衣服的时候，先清一清箱底，旧衣服能穿的就穿，能改的就改，破了的可以补一补，除非迫切需要，不要添置新衣服。武汉市百货公司中心门市部营业员李义铭在信中说，他经常碰到一些本来不打算买布的顾客，只因为看到了新花样的布就顺手买了。李义铭认为，像这样可买可不买的布，都应该节约下来，让那些真正需要的人买。
    “长江日报”发表了这些来信，又接连收到许多群众来信，响应节约棉布的建议。
    他们建议社会舆论批判那些互相比穿好衣服，认为穿了补过的衣服就不光采的思想；另一方面还应该做到有啥穿啥，如过去有旧西装的人也可把西装穿起来，不必另作新衣。许多读者还要求坚决压缩机关单位为了讲究排场而大量添置的窗帘、桌布等公用布。

    吉林
    中共吉林省委已向下级党委发出指示，要求各地做好棉布折半供应的宣传工作。宣传工作正在各地进行。
    长春市棉布供应部门调查了公用布的使用情况后，已决定把原供应三百八十万尺缩减到三百万尺。许多工厂职工、街道居民听到节约用布的宣传以后，纷纷表示今年少添或不添衣物。
    兰州
    兰州市的党政领导机关于19日上午向各机关、企业职工传达了棉布折半供应的办法，并从4月20日起执行新办法购布。
    新乡
    河南省新乡市在4月20日已开始执行棉布折半供应的办法。新乡市党政领导对这一工作十分重视，目前正在向广大群众进行宣传。实行布票对折后的新乡市场十分稳定，消费者普遍反映折半供应对夏季衣服问题影响不大。（附图片）
