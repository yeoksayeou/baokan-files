    Yunnan's Precious Specialty - "Sanqi"
    Zeng Xiao

    Yunnan abounds in many precious medicinal materials. Of all the various medicinal materials found throughout the country, over 70% are produced in Yunnan. Therefore, Yunnan has long been known as the "treasure house of medicinal materials."

    There is a plant in Yunnan where the upper end of the stem grows three branches, and each branch has seven leaves. Therefore, people call it "Sanqi" (三七), literally "Three-Seven."

    According to tests, "Sanqi" contains 64% iron. It has special effects for stopping bleeding, promoting blood circulation, and breaking up blood stasis. It can treat all kinds of blood disorders, such as hematemesis, epistaxis, hematochezia, hematuria, metrorrhagia, blood dysentery, excessive menstruation, and postpartum bleeding. Dai Huifen, a famous doctor at the Yunnan Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, said: "Sanqi" is a remarkably effective drug in traditional Chinese medicine, and it is highly valued in internal medicine, surgery, traumatology, and gynecology. "Yunnan Baiyao" (云南白药), also known as "Bao Bao Dan" (百宝丹) - a medicine that has long been famous at home and abroad - contains "Sanqi" as one of its main ingredients.

    "Sanqi" is mainly produced in various counties of the Wenshan Special District in Yunnan. It is only suitable for cultivation on the semi-slopes with mild climates and black sandy soil. When you pass through the Wenshan Special District, you can see countless small sheds everywhere in the continuous evergreen mountains. Under these small sheds, the medicine farmers cultivate "Sanqi." It is harvested in the summer and sown in the winter each year. Three months after sowing, the seedlings need to be transplanted. During transplanting, a one-meter-high bamboo shed needs to be built around it, and it is covered with straw or leaves. This is because "Sanqi" cannot withstand strong sunlight, nor can it withstand strong wind and rain. It also needs to maintain the soil's moisture, but it cannot be overwatered. "Sanqi" needs to be cultivated for at least three years before it can be harvested; some are cultivated for as long as five to ten years, requiring a lot of labor. Before liberation, mostly landlords, rich peasants, and relatively wealthy farmers cultivated it. Ordinary farmers could not afford to cultivate it.

    After liberation, the government vigorously provided loans and grain to help the vast number of farmers cultivate this medicine. Farmers who cultivate 10,000 "Sanqi" plants can harvest forty to fifty *jin* (市斤) after three years, worth more than two thousand *yuan*. The output of "Sanqi" has increased year by year, greatly improving the lives of the farmers. In 1950, only more than 6,000 *jin* were produced; in 1956, it reached 70,000 *jin*. Last year, after the basic realization of agricultural cooperativization in the entire special district, the development of "Sanqi" production was even more rapid. It is estimated that this year's output will be 90,000 *jin*. Most farmers in the Wenshan Special District have built new tile-roofed houses or renovated their previously dilapidated houses. Some farmers have also bought watches and radios, etc.

    "Sanqi" not only meets the needs of various parts of the country, but also exports a portion every year. On the international market, about 100 kilograms of medium-grade "Sanqi" can be exchanged for a tractor. Almost every year, people from countries such as India, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Burma, Vietnam, and Australia come to Hong Kong to purchase goods. Due to the development of "Sanqi" production, the export volume has also increased year by year. Last year, the export of "Sanqi" was about eight tons, an increase of 81% compared to 1955, which had the largest export volume in history. This "Sanqi" can earn more than 4,000 tons of steel for the country. This year, the export volume of Yunnan's "Sanqi" will increase even more than last year.

    云南名贵的特产——“三七”
    曾晓
    云南盛产许多名贵的药材。全国所有的各种药材中，有70％以上云南都产。因此，云南在很早以前就有“药材的宝库”之称。
    云南有一种植物，树茎的上端生长着三个分枝，每个分枝上都长着七片叶子。因此，人们就把它叫“三七”。
      “三七”据化验含有铁质64％，它对止血、活血、破血有特效作用，并能医治一切血症，如吐血、?血、下血、血尿、血崩、血痢、月经过多、产后流血不止等。云南省中医院著名医生戴慧芬说：“三七”在中药中是疗效显著的药物，不论内科、外科、伤科或妇科都非常重视应用它。早已闻名国内外的“云南白药”（又名百宝丹）的主要原料之一，就是“三七”。
      “三七”的产地集中在云南文山专区各县。它只宜在气候温和及黑沙土壤的半山坡上培植。当你路过文山专区的时候，在那连绵不断而四季常青的山丛中，到处都可以看到有无数的小棚子。在这些小棚子的下面，就是药农们栽培的“三七”。它在每年夏季收获，冬季下种。下种后三个月的时间就要移苗，在移苗时就需要搭一公尺高的竹棚围住，上面盖上稻草或树叶。因为“三七”不能耐较强的阳光，也经不起较大的风吹雨打，又要经常保持土壤的润湿，但也不能受水过多。“三七”最少要培植三年才能收获，有的还培植到五年至十年之久，需要的人工很多。在解放前，多半是地主、富农和较富裕的农民才栽种它，一般农民是栽种不起的。
    解放后，政府大力贷款贷粮帮助广大农民栽种这种药物。农民们培植一万株“三七”，三年后可以收获四、五十市斤，价值在两千元以上。“三七”的产量年年增加，大大地改善了农民的生活。1950年，只产了六千多斤；在1956年，就产到七万斤。去年全专区基本实现农业合作化后，“三七”的产量发展更为迅速，估计今年可产九万斤。文山专区大多数农民都盖了新瓦房或翻修了以前的破旧房屋。有些农民还买了手表和收音机等。
      “三七”不仅供应全国各地的需要，每年还要出口一部分，在国际市场上，大约一百公斤左右的中等“三七”就可换回一台拖拉机。印度、新加坡、印度尼西亚、泰国、缅甸、越南和澳大利亚等国，差不多每年都有人到香港进货。由于“三七”生产的发展，出口量也一年比一年增加。去年出口的“三七”有八吨左右，比历史上出口数量最大的1955年增加了81％。这些“三七”可为国家换回四千多吨钢材。今年，云南“三七”的出口量还要比去年增加。
