Chairman Voroshilov's Speech

Dear Comrade Mao Zedong, Dear Comrades, Fellow Citizens of Beijing, the glorious capital of the People's Republic of China:

We are extremely delighted to be in China. This is my first visit to your beautiful country, but I cannot say that I am entirely unfamiliar with it. We, the older generation of communists, have watched with fervent sympathy the Chinese people's struggle against the oppression of imperialism and feudalism, and for national independence and social freedom, long before the great October Socialist Revolution in Russia. Even in those distant times, our leader Lenin wrote that China was awakening, and he expressed his firm belief that the Chinese people would defeat the imperialist enslavers and feudalism. The great Lenin's prediction has come true. The Chinese people have driven the foreign imperialists out of their homeland, eliminated feudalism, and embarked on the path of building socialism in their own country. (Prolonged applause)

We have come to the People's Republic of China for a friendly visit at the kind invitation of the most esteemed Chairman of the People's Republic of China, Comrade Mao Zedong. We intend to take advantage of this opportunity to learn directly about the fraternal Chinese people, their intense and heroic labor, and the remarkable achievements in building a new socialist life. (Applause)

The Soviet people have always admired the great Chinese people for enduring all hardships in the arduous struggle for the freedom and independence of their motherland with heroic courage. The victory of the Chinese people's revolution and the birth of the People's Republic of China are among the greatest historical events of our time. We are immensely proud of our Chinese friends and brothers for the achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party. (Applause)

I am particularly pleased to point out that in the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism, our two peoples are marching forward side by side, closely uniting our ranks, and helping and supporting each other.

The governments of our two countries are pursuing a policy of easing international tensions and preventing new wars from breaking out anywhere in the world. We oppose military blocs, we advocate collective security, and we advocate peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition between capitalist and socialist countries. Our two peoples have always advocated and still advocate the reduction of armaments and the complete prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons. (Applause)

The Soviet government firmly supports the demand of the government of the People's Republic of China to recover its inseparable part—Taiwan.

The Soviet government believes that the absence of representation for the People's Republic of China in the United Nations is extremely unfair to the People's Republic of China and all peace-loving countries. Excluding the People's Republic of China from the United Nations primarily harms this international organization, because it is impossible to make any important decisions without the participation of the great China. (Applause)

Dear Comrades! The whole world sees that the strength of the socialist camp has been further united, the cooperation between socialist countries is developing and deepening, and the friendship between the Soviet Union and China is becoming more consolidated. The friendship and unity between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union is a great factor in the unity of all socialist countries and an important pillar of world peace. (Applause)

Please allow me, in my personal name and on behalf of the comrades accompanying me, to express my heartfelt gratitude to Comrade Mao Zedong and the government of the People's Republic of China for the invitation to visit China. Let me take this happy opportunity to express the warmest respect and best wishes of the Soviet people, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and myself to the glorious and powerful Chinese people, the fraternal Communist Party of China, and all democratic parties and organizations in China. (Applause)

Dear friends, thank you for your warm welcome!

May the unbreakable friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples develop and consolidate!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live the great Chinese people! (Enthusiastic applause)

    伏罗希洛夫主席的讲话亲爱的毛泽东同志：亲爱的同志们，中华人民共和国光荣的首都——北京市的男女公民们：
    我们来到中国，感到莫大的欢欣。我是第一次来到你们这个美好的国家，但是我不能说我对它毫不熟悉。我们老一辈的共产党人，远在俄国伟大的十月社会主义革命以前，就已怀着热烈的同情注视着中国人民为反对帝国主义和封建主义的压迫，为争取民族独立和社会自由而进行的斗争。还在那遥远的时期，我们的领袖列宁就写道，中国在觉醒着，他并且表示坚信中国人民必将战胜帝国主义奴役者和封建主义。伟大列宁的预见实现了。中国人民从自己国土上赶走了外国帝国主义者，消灭了封建主义，走上了在本国建设社会主义的道路。（经久不息的鼓掌）
    我们是应最敬爱的中华人民共和国主席毛泽东同志的亲切邀请来到中华人民共和国进行友好访问的。我们准备利用这次访问中国的机会直接了解兄弟的中国人民，了解他们紧张而英勇的劳动和建设社会主义新生活的卓越成果。　（鼓掌）
    苏联人民一向钦佩伟大的中国人民以英勇果敢的精神在争取自己祖国自由和独立的严峻斗争中承受了一切艰难困苦。中国人民革命的胜利以及中华人民共和国的诞生，是我们这时代最伟大的历史事件之一。中国人民在光荣的共产党领导下所取得的成就，使我们为自己的中国朋友和兄弟感到无比的骄傲。　（鼓掌）
    我特别愉快地指出，在争取和平、民主和社会主义的斗争中，我们两国人民并肩前进、紧密团结着自己的队伍并相互帮助和支持。
    我们两国政府执行着缓和国际紧张局势和防止世界任何地方发生新战争的政策，我们反对军事集团，我们主张集体安全，主张资本主义国家和社会主义国家之间的和平共处和和平竞赛。我们两国人民过去和现在一直主张裁减军备和完全禁止原子武器和氢武器。（鼓掌）
    苏联政府坚决支持中华人民共和国政府收回它不可分割的部分——台湾的要求。
    苏联政府认为，中华人民共和国在联合国中没有代表是对中华人民共和国及所有爱好和平国家极不公正的事情。把中华人民共和国排除在联合国之外，首先使这个国际组织受到损失，因为没有伟大的中国参加，是不可能采取任何重要决定的。（鼓掌）
    亲爱的同志们！全世界都看到社会主义阵营的力量已进一步团结，社会主义国家的合作在发展和加深，苏中的友谊也更加巩固。中华人民共和国和苏联的友好和团结是所有社会主义国家团结的伟大因素，是世界和平的重要支柱。（鼓掌）
    请让我以个人的名义并代表随行的同志向毛泽东同志和中华人民共和国政府对访问中国的邀请表示衷心的感谢。让我利用这个愉快的机会向光荣的强大的中国人民、兄弟般的中国共产党以及中国所有的民主党派和团体表达苏联人民、苏联共产党和我自己的最热烈的敬意和最良好的愿望。（鼓掌）
    亲爱的朋友们，谢谢你们热烈的欢迎！
    让苏中人民牢不可破的友谊发展和巩固！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    伟大的中国人民万岁！　（热烈鼓掌）
