    Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, April 1st: The Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government and Socialist Workers' Party delegation, headed by Kadar, returned to Budapest on March 31st from Kiev after visiting the Soviet Union.
    A grand welcoming ceremony of several thousand people was held at the airport.
    Prime Minister Kadar and Dobi, Chairman of the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic, inspected the guard of honor after disembarking from the plane. They also inspected a worker's picket line composed of more than fifteen hundred people.
    The bands played the Hungarian and Soviet national anthems. Then, Young Pioneers presented flowers to Kadar, Dobi, and others. The crowd shouted "Long live the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party!" "Long live Hungarian-Soviet friendship!"
    First Deputy Prime Minister of the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government, Münnich, delivered a welcoming speech.
    Afterward, Kadar addressed the crowd. He said that our delegation confirmed that the Soviet government has shown sincere friendship towards Hungary. The Soviet government has always respected the Leninist principles of equality, independence, and national sovereignty, and is applying these principles in practice. At the same time, the representatives of the two parties showed ideological and political unity and consistency during the talks. We confirm that this meeting was very successful. It strengthened the friendship and mutual ties between the two countries, the two peoples, and the two parties. The agreements reached during the talks not only conform to the interests of the Hungarian people and help to solve the problems we face, but also are conducive to world peace and the cause of the people of all countries who are fighting for independence.
    Speaking of the issue of Soviet troops stationed on Hungarian territory, Kadar said that the Soviet troops currently stationed in Hungary are helping to defend Hungary's national independence and prevent imperialist plots of aggression. He said that as long as the interests of the Hungarian working people still require the Soviet army to remain in Hungary, the Soviet army will remain stationed there.
    After the speech, Kadar, Dobi, and other leaders of the Hungarian government and party walked in front of the thousands of welcoming crowds and shook hands with the old workers in the crowd. At this time, the masses cheered enthusiastically and rushed forward to greet the leaders of the party and government. Finally, everyone sang the Internationale together.

    匈牙利党和政府代表团回到布达佩斯
    卡达尔强调苏匈会谈加强了两国友谊
    新华社布达佩斯1日电　以卡达尔为首的匈牙利工农革命政府和社会主义工人党代表团，在访问苏联以后，已经在3月31日从基辅回到布达佩斯。
    在飞机场上，举行了几千人的盛大欢迎会。
    卡达尔总理和匈牙利人民共和国主席团主席道比在下飞机后检阅了仪仗队。他们还检阅了由一千五百多人组成的工人纠察队。
    乐队奏起匈牙利和苏联国歌。接着，少年先锋队员向卡达尔、道比等人献花。这时，全场高呼“匈牙利社会主义工人党万岁！”“匈苏友谊万岁！”
    工农革命政府第一副总理明尼赫致欢迎词。
    随后，卡达尔向大家讲了话。他说，我们代表团确认，苏联政府对匈牙利表现了真诚的友谊。苏联政府始终尊重平等、独立和国家主权的列宁主义原则，并且正在实践中运用这些原则。同时，两党代表在会谈过程中，显示了思想上和政治上的统一和一致。我们确认，这次会谈进行得非常成功。它加强了两国、两国人民和两党之间的友谊和互相联系。会谈中达成的协议不仅符合匈牙利人民的利益和有助于我们所面临的问题的解决，同时也有利于世界和平和正在为争取独立而斗争的各国人民的事业。
    在谈到苏联军队驻扎在匈牙利领土上的问题时，卡达尔说，目前驻在匈牙利的苏联部队正在帮助捍卫匈牙利的民族独立，防止帝国主义者的侵略阴谋。他说，当匈牙利劳动人民的利益还要求苏联军队留驻在匈牙利的时候，苏联军队将一直留驻下去。
    讲话以后，卡达尔、道比同匈牙利政府和党的其他领导人走向几千欢迎群众的面前，并且和人群中的老工人们握手。这时，群众热烈欢呼，并且拥向前来向党和政府的领导人问候。最后，大家一起唱起了国际歌。
