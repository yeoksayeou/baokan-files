Comrade Zhu Guang! Dear Comrades and Friends!

We have been in China for nearly two weeks. During these days, we have been greatly honored to receive the gracious hospitality of the representatives of the great Chinese people—the leading comrades of China and the representatives of the working people. We have been warmly welcomed by the Chinese people everywhere during our friendly visit to fraternal China. The cordial meetings with the Chinese people have made me very happy and deeply moved. Through these warm and cordial welcomes and meetings, we have seen the love and respect of the Chinese people for the Soviet people. Dear comrades! We know that the Soviet people also have sincere and deep friendship for the Chinese people. The Chinese people are the brothers of the Soviet people and their loyal comrades-in-arms in the cause of transforming human society on the basis of socialism. During our visit to the People's Republic of China, we have been to several cities, each with its own glorious history and unique traditions, each playing an important role in the heroic struggle for the freedom and independence of the Chinese people. Among the outstanding cities of China, Guangzhou is a city that occupies a special place in the national liberation struggle and in the fight against class oppression.

As early as the 1840s, the Guangzhou area was already the center of the Chinese people's struggle against foreign invaders. Your predecessors, your ancestors, did not shed their blood in vain. The Chinese people feel greatly encouraged whenever they recall the feats they have established, and thus fight selflessly for independence and freedom, and for a new and happy life for all the working people of China.

Guangzhou is known as the fortress of the Chinese revolution. Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the great revolutionary nationalist of China and a friend of Soviet Russia, once worked and fought here. The first Marxist group in China was also established in Guangzhou. During the First Revolutionary Civil War, Comrade Mao Zedong trained revolutionary peasant cadres here, and Comrade Zhou Enlai also presided over political education work here, cultivating reliable and strong cadres for the National Revolutionary Army fighting for the freedom of the motherland.

In your city, mass anti-imperialist and anti-feudal movements have broken out more than once. In December 1927, a proletarian uprising broke out here, establishing a people's regime and announcing a grand program against imperialism and the feudal landlord system. The Soviet Union greeted the revolutionary movement of the working people of Guangzhou and their first victory with warm sympathy. At that time, the Soviet Union regarded all this as the great future of the liberation movement in China and the world.

Dear comrades! The victory of the Chinese People's Revolution ended the many years of heavy enslavement of the Chinese people by imperialism and domestic reactionaries. The reason why the Chinese people's unremitting struggle for liberation over the decades has achieved the final glorious victory is because they have been led by the Communist Party of China, armed with the science of Marxism-Leninism. The Communist Party of China united the entire Chinese people and led them on the correct path. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have established their own independent people's democratic country—the People's Republic of China. The Communist Party of China firmly and bravely organizes all the forces of the people for socialist construction. The working people of the People's Republic of China have achieved remarkable achievements in building a new socialist life in recent years. We can see everywhere that the Chinese people, including the working people of Guangzhou, are fighting with full confidence to realize the industrialization of the country and to develop agriculture on a new cooperative basis.

Dear comrades! Your achievements not only strengthen the power of your motherland, but also strengthen the power of the entire socialist camp. Your achievements inspire the Soviet people and the people of other fraternal countries to create new tools of labor. We are pleased that the friendship between the Soviet and Chinese people is becoming more and more consolidated, and that the cooperation between our two countries and among the countries of our socialist camp in politics, economy, culture, etc. is developing smoothly.

Guangzhou is thousands of kilometers away from the Soviet Union, but this does not hinder the close relationship between the people of our two countries. True brotherly friendship cannot be separated. We believe that this visit to the outstanding People's Republic of China will further consolidate this friendship. The more consolidated our friendship is, the greater our achievements in building a new, bright and happy socialist life will be, and the more guaranteed world peace will be. Mankind needs peace, just as it needs air and sunshine, just as it needs its own life. The friendship between China and the Soviet Union is a powerful force, a force that is unprecedented in human history, whether in the past or now. In the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism, the people of our two countries always support each other and advance shoulder to shoulder.

Dear comrades, we must not forget that our two countries not only have friends, but also, regrettably, cunning and treacherous enemies. Every step we take forward will make them panic, and some people will even lose their minds in resentment, often appearing distracted and mad. These gentlemen in capitalist countries spread all kinds of despicable and filthy lies and rumors through their own or bought newspapers of other countries, trying to blur the understanding of freedom-loving people, trying to influence some indecisive elements in socialist countries, so as to hinder us from building our own happy new life. The enemies from the imperialist camp not only threaten the people of the Soviet Union and China with devastating war, but also threaten the people of all countries that have been liberated from oppression. The imperialists have launched an unprecedented arms expansion. Not only that, they also launched a bandit-like attack on peaceful Egypt and instigated a counter-revolutionary riot in Hungary. Thanks to the resolute joint action of the countries of the socialist camp and the peace-loving people of the world, these provocative actions collapsed. The important task before all people who cherish freedom and independence, and who cherish peaceful development and progress, is to continue to resolutely fight for world peace and for the peaceful coexistence of countries with different socio-political systems.

We have always advocated peace, but this is not because our country is not strong enough. No, the power of socialist countries is strong, and if necessary, they are able to defend themselves and give the enemy a fatal blow. The Soviet Union has been fighting for peace since its birth, because defending peace is our principled policy. The founder and leader of the Soviet state, the great Lenin, said more than once that all wars are launched by exploiters, and the people all hope to live in peace and friendship. The Soviet government has always unswervingly implemented Lenin's policy of peace. Now, we should do everything possible to prevent war from breaking out anywhere. The people of the world now clearly understand the disaster of war. In the struggle to defend peace, the people of the world support us.

We openly say to those who engage in military adventures: those who play with fire will burn themselves, and you will reap what you sow. We want to tell them that it is better to have peaceful cooperation and competition to see whose system is good, socialist or capitalist.

We communists are convinced of the superiority of socialism, and the lives of the Soviet and Chinese people, as well as the lives of the people of other socialist countries, fully prove this belief.

We all know very well that it is entirely possible to ease international tensions and consolidate peace. The people of the world do not want war, oppose the use of weapons of mass destruction—atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs—and advocate disarmament. As long as the people of the world unite in the struggle for peace, all the enemy's conspiracies will fail. We believe that the Soviet and Chinese people, including you, the people of Guangdong, will continue to be at the forefront of the warriors defending peace.

Dear comrades of Guangzhou, I sincerely wish you new victories in your great and creative socialist labor.

Long live the eternal friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people!

Long live the great Chinese people led by the Communist Party of China!

Long live the glorious city of Guangzhou and the outstanding people here—the people of Guangzhou!

Long live world peace!

    伏罗希洛夫在广州群众大会上讲话
    中苏人民永远互相支援并肩前进
    警告军事冒险者：玩火必自焚！亲爱的朱光同志！亲爱的同志们，朋友们！
    我们来到中国近两个星期了，在这些日子里，我们十分荣幸地受到了伟大中国人民代表——中国的各位领导同志和劳动人民的代表们所给予我们的殷勤款待。我们在兄弟般的中国进行友好访问期间到处都受到了中国人民的热烈欢迎。同中国人民的亲切会见使我非常高兴，并且深深地受到感动。通过这些热烈亲切的欢迎和会见，我们看到了中国人民对苏联人民的热爱和尊敬。亲爱的同志们！我们知道，苏联人民对中国人民同样怀着真诚的和深厚的友情，中国人民是苏联人民的兄弟，在社会主义的基础上改造人类社会的事业中，中国人民是苏联人民的忠实的战友。我们在中华人民共和国访问期间，到过好几个城市，每一个城市都有自己的光荣历史和独特的传统，每个城市在为中国人民的自由和独立而进行的英勇斗争中都起了重要作用。在中国的出色的城市中，广州是一个在民族解放斗争中，在反对阶级压迫的战斗里占有特殊地位的一个城市。
    早在十九世纪四十年代里，广州地区已经是中国人民反对外国侵略者的斗争中心。你们的先辈，你们的祖先并没有白白地流血。中国人民每当追忆起他们建立的功勋，就会感到很大的鼓舞，从而奋不顾身地去为独立和自由，为中国全体劳动人民的新的幸福的生活进行斗争。
    人们都把广州称作中国革命的堡垒。中国的伟大的革命的民族主义者和苏俄的朋友孙中山先生曾经在这里工作过、斗争过。在广州也曾成立过中国最初的马克思主义小组，在第一次国内革命战争时期，毛泽东同志曾经在这里训练了革命的农民干部，周恩来同志也在这里主持过政治教育工作，替为祖国的自由而斗争的国民革命军培养了可靠的坚强的干部。
    在你们这个城市里不止一次地爆发过群众性的反帝反封建的运动，1927年12月在这里爆发了无产阶级的起义，建立了人民政权并且宣布了反对帝国主义反对封建地主制度的宏大纲领。苏联曾怀着热烈的同情，迎接了广州劳动人民的革命运动和他们的第一次胜利。当时，苏联把这一切都看成是全中国和全世界解放运动的伟大前途。
    亲爱的同志们！中国人民革命的胜利结束了多年来帝国主义和国内反动派对中国人民沉重的奴役。几十年来，中国人民为争取解放而不断进行的忘我斗争所以获得最后光荣的胜利，是因为他们得到了以马克思列宁主义科学武装起来的中国共产党的领导。中国共产党团结了全中国人民并把他们引向正确的道路。在中国共产党的领导下，中国人民建立了自己的独立的人民民主的国家——中华人民共和国。中国共产党坚定勇敢地组织人民的一切力量进行社会主义建设，中华人民共和国的劳动人民几年来在建设新的社会主义生活中已经获得了显著的成就。我们到处都能看到，中国人民，其中包括广州的劳动人民都在信心百倍地进行着斗争，以实现国家的工业化和在新的合作化的基础上来发展农业。
    亲爱的同志们！你们的成就不仅加强了你们祖国的威力，同时也加强了整个社会主义阵营的威力。你们的成就鼓舞着苏联人民和其他各兄弟国家的人民去创造新的劳动工具。使我们高兴的是：苏中两国人民的友谊愈来愈巩固，我们两国之间以及我们社会主义阵营各国之间在政治、经济、文化等方面的合作都正在顺利地发展着。
    广州同苏联固然相隔几千公里，但是这并不能妨碍我们两国人民之间的休戚相关的关系，真正的兄弟般的友谊是无法相隔的。我们相信，我们这一次来到出色的中华人民共和国访问，将更进一步地巩固这种友谊。我们的友谊愈巩固，我们在建设新的光明愉快的社会主义生活中的成绩也就愈大，世界和平也就愈有保证。人类需要和平，正像需要空气和太阳，正像需要自己的生命一样。中苏两国的友谊是强大的力量，这种力量无论过去或是现在在人类历史上都是空前的。在争取和平、民主和社会主义的斗争中，我们两国人民总是互相支援，并肩前进的。
    亲爱的同志们，我们不能忘记，我们两国不仅有朋友，遗憾的是我们也有奸狡巨猾的敌人，我们每前进一步，都会使他们惊惶失措，有些人甚至忿恨地丧失理智，常常显得神魂颠倒和发狂。这些资本主义国家的先生们通过本国的或是收买来的别国的报刊散播种种卑鄙龌龊的谎言和造谣撞骗，企图模糊爱好自由人民的认识，企图影响一些在社会主义国度里的不够坚决的分子，以便阻碍我们建设自己的幸福的新生活。来自帝国主义阵营的敌人们，不仅用毁灭性的战争威胁苏中两国人民，而且威胁已经从压迫下获得了解放的各国人民。帝国主义者展开了空前的军备扩张。不仅如此他们还对和平的埃及进行了强盗式的袭击，在匈牙利策动了反革命的暴动。由于社会主义阵营各国的和全世界爱好和平人民的坚决的联合行动，这些挑衅行动垮台了。摆在一切珍视自由和独立，珍视和平发展和进步的人们面前的重要任务，就是继续坚决地为争取世界和平而斗争，为争取社会政治制度不同各国间的和平共处而斗争。
    我们一向主张和平，但这并不是因为我们的国家还不够强大。不是的，社会主义国家的力量是强大的，只要是有必要，他们是能够保卫自己，而对敌人给予致命的打击。苏联自从诞生起就为和平而斗争，因为保卫和平是我们的原则政策。苏维埃国家的创始人和领导者伟大的列宁不止一次地说过，历次的战争都是剥削者发动的，而人民都是希望生活在和平友谊中的。苏联政府始终不渝地贯彻列宁的和平政策。现在，我们应当尽一切努力使得在任何地方都不发生战争。全世界人民现在都清楚地懂得了战争的惨祸，在保卫和平的斗争中，全世界人民都是支持我们的。
    我们公开地向那些进行军事冒险的人们说：玩火者自焚，你们将要自食其果的。我们要告诉他们，最好还是和平合作和进行竞赛，来看一看谁的制度好，是社会主义制度抑或是资本主义制度。
    我们共产党人确信社会主义的优越性，而苏联人民和中国人民的生活以及其他社会主义国家人民的生活完全证明了这个信念。
    我们大家都很清楚，缓和国际紧张局势和巩固和平是完全可能的。全世界的人民都不要战争，都反对使用大规模毁灭性的武器——原子弹和氢弹，都主张裁减军备。只要全世界的人民在争取和平的斗争中团结起来，敌人的一切阴谋就都会破产。　　我们相信苏联人民和中国人民，其中包括你们，广东的人民，今后将继续走在保卫和平的战士的最前列。
    亲爱的广州市的同志们，我衷心地祝你们在巨大的、创造性的社会主义劳动中取得新的胜利。
    中苏人民之间的永恒友谊万岁！
    中国共产党领导的伟大的中国人民繁荣壮大万岁！
    光荣的广州市和这儿的出色的人们——广州人民万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
