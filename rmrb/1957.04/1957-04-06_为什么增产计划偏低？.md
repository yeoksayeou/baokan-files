    Why is the Production Increase Plan Too Low?

    The Jiaozuo Mining Bureau's plan for increasing production and practicing economy this year has only recently been initially formulated. This plan calls for an increase in coal production of 60,000 to 80,000 tons more than the state plan. In fact, the bureau had already overproduced raw coal by 67,000 tons in January and February (excluding the 8,000 tons increased during the Spring Festival). In the words of engineering and technical personnel: with a little effort from all employees, this year's coal production could be increased by 100,000 to 200,000 tons. Therefore, it must be said that the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau's production increase plan is conservative. Moreover, this conservatism has become a serious obstacle to the further development of the campaign to increase production and practice economy in Jiaozuo's coal mines.

    Why didn't the leaders of the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau set a more advanced production increase plan to produce more coal for the country? Why didn't they release the plan earlier? This is exactly what many cadres and technicians are speculating about.

    Some people believe that the leaders of the bureau have the following idea in mind: last year's plan was too ambitious, and production was very passive, so this year's plan should be "conservative rather than ambitious." As early as the end of last year, when the Ministry of Coal Industry held a planning meeting, they came with a pre-determined framework of 2.18 million to 2.2 million tons of output decided at the bureau's meeting to cope with the leadership. Therefore, when the Central South Coal Mine Administration decided to give them a production target of 2.23 million tons, they resolutely refused to accept it. At that time, a deputy director who attended the meeting at the Ministry of Coal Industry made two phone calls requesting the bureau's meeting to decide whether to accept the task given by the Central South Coal Mine Administration, but the leaders of the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau refused to accept it, forming a stalemate and arguing fiercely, until finally, they reluctantly accepted it. Later, the Chunlin area of ​​Lifeng Mine experienced a water flooding accident, and the Mining Bureau took the opportunity to ask the Central South Coal Mine Administration to reduce the task by 30,000 tons. As a result, they still achieved their original plan of "producing only 2.2 million tons of coal this year." Some people commented: even with such a conservative plan, they are afraid that the higher authorities will know that the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau has potential, and they are reluctant to release it!

    This year's production at the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau is indeed facing some difficulties. The production area of ​​Wangfeng Mine is not as good as in the past; there is a large amount of water in Mine No. 39; Xiaomacun Mine is a newly transferred mine with abnormal production, and so on. The leaders of the coal mine should not only have foresight about the difficulties in production, but also take measures to overcome them. However, we should not only think about the difficulties but also ignore the favorable conditions. Wangfeng Mine has always been the mine with the highest coal production in the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau. This mine actually produced 1.26 million tons of coal last year. This year's plan is only 1.13 million tons. According to some engineering and technical personnel of the Mining Bureau, it is difficult for Wangfeng Mine to complete as many tasks as last year, such as: high gas levels, scattered mining areas, and long transportation distances. However, at the very least, 1.2 million tons can be completed. In fact, so far, coal production has exceeded the target by 40,000 tons.

    Xiaomacun Mine is a new mine that was only transferred in October last year. The production of this mine has become regular, and coal production exceeded the target by more than 10,000 tons in January and February. This mine has a high degree of mechanization, the working face cycle is very regular, the mining area is sufficient, and the underground gas is not high. In addition to the above favorable conditions, a combine coal mining machine will be tested in another working face of Xiaomacun Mine in May this year. If the test is successful, it may increase production by 80,000 to 100,000 tons, and even if it is not successful, it may exceed the target by 60,000 to 70,000 tons of coal. The leaders of this mine have made a careful analysis of these favorable conditions, so they once requested the Mining Bureau to give them 50,000 tons more coal production task. The Mining Bureau not only did not reply in time, but also said that they were "making a fuss." Later, after repeated requests from Xiaomacun Mine, they reluctantly agreed to give them a task of 30,000 tons.

    Lifeng and Mine No. 39 have more difficulties. However, the area conditions of Lifeng Mine this year are better than last year. There is coal to be mined in the western area; the water in the Chunlin area has been basically drained, and production can begin in the early third quarter, and the old mining area can continue to produce. The main reason for the current poor production situation in Mine No. 39 is that the workers' minds are confused, labor discipline is lax, and the attendance rate is very low. If the leaders of these two mines strengthen the political education of workers and improve management, they can also exceed the target.

    Based on the above situation, it must be said that the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau does not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of the country's urgent need for coal, has not seen the production enthusiasm of the vast number of employees, and has not seen many favorable conditions in production. They do not dare to rely on the masses, especially the technical personnel, and overly believe in themselves, thus invisibly hurting the enthusiasm of the masses.

    If the leaders of the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau can go deep into reality, revise the annual production increase plan based on the production requirements of the vast number of employees, they can increase the production of more coal.

### 为什么增产计划偏低？

    为什么增产计划偏低？
    焦作矿务局今年的增产节约方案最近才初步制订出来。这个方案比国家计划多增产六到八万吨煤炭。其实，这个局在1、2月份业已超产原煤六万七千吨（不包括春节增产的八千多吨）。如果用工程技术人员的话来说：全局职工努努力，今年就可以增产十万吨到二十万吨煤。因此，这就不能不说焦作矿务局的增产计划是保守的。而且，这种保守思想已经成了焦作各煤矿进一步开展增产节约的严重阻碍。
    为什么焦作矿务局的领导人不把增产计划订得先进些，为国家多增产些煤炭呢？为什么不把计划早一点拿出来呢？这也正是不少干部和技术人员都在猜测的问题。
    有人认为：局的领导思想上存在着：去年计划冒进，生产很被动，所以今年的计划“宁肯保守，也不要冒进”的想法。早在去年年底，煤炭工业部召开计划会议的时候，他们就带着事先在局务会议上决定好的产量二百一十八万到二百二十万吨的框框来应付领导。所以当中南煤矿管理局决定给他们二百二十三万吨产量指标时，他们就坚决不肯接受。当时在煤炭工业部参加会议的一位副局长曾经打过两次电话要求局务会议决定是否接受中南煤矿管理局给的任务，但焦作矿务局的领导上始终不肯接受，形成僵局，争吵得很厉害，直到最后，才算勉强接受下来。后来，李封矿春林区发生出水事故，矿务局又借机要求中南煤矿管理局削减了三万吨任务。结果，还是达到了他们原计划“本年度只生产二百二十万吨煤”的意图。有些人议论：就是这样保守的计划，还怕上级知道焦作矿务局有潜力，迟迟不敢拿出来呢！
    焦作矿务局今年的生产确实有些困难。王封矿的生产地区不如过去好；三十九号矿井水大；小马村矿是新移交的矿井，生产不正常等等。煤矿的领导人，对生产中的困难，不但应该有预见性，而且还要采取措施克服它。但是，不能只想困难，而忽视有利条件。王封矿一向是焦作矿务局出煤最多的矿井，这个矿去年实际上生产了一百二十六万吨煤。今年的计划只订了一百十三万吨。据矿务局有些工程技术人员说，王封矿要完成去年那样多的任务，是有困难的，如：瓦斯大、采区分散、运输远。但是最低限度是可以完成一百二十万吨。实际上到目前为止，已经超产四万吨煤炭。
    小马村矿是去年10月份才移交的新矿井。这个矿的生产已走上正规，1、2月份超产煤炭一万多吨。这个矿井机械化程度高，工作面循环又很正规，采区地区充足，井下瓦斯也不大。除了上述有利条件，今年5月，还要在小马村矿另一个工作面试用康拜因采煤。如果试验成功，还可能增产八到十万吨，就是不成功也可能超产六至七万吨煤炭。这个矿的领导，对这些有利条件作了认真的分析，所以他们曾要求矿务局多给五万吨煤炭任务。矿务局不但没有及时答复，反而说他们“瞎闹”。后来，经过小马村矿再三要求，才勉强答应给了三万吨任务。
    李封、三十九号矿井这两个矿困难比较多。但今年李封矿的地区条件，比去年还要好些，西区有煤可采；春林区的水已基本放净，到三季度初就可以生产，而且老采地区还可以继续生产。三十九号矿井目前生产情况不好的主要原因，是职工思想混乱，劳动纪律松弛，出勤率很低。这两个矿的领导如果加强工人的政治教育和改进管理，也是可以超产的。
    根据上述情况，不能不说焦作矿务局是对国家急需煤炭的重要意义认识不足，没有看到广大职工的生产积极性，也没有看到生产上的许多有利条件，不敢依靠群众、尤其是技术人员，过分的相信了自己，因而无形中伤害了群众的积极性。
    焦作矿务局的领导人如果能深入到实际中去，根据广大职工增产要求，修订全年增产计划，还可以增产更多的煤炭。
