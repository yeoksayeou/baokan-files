    The Algerian People's Armed Struggle Against Colonialism
    Yan Jin
    The Algerian people's struggle against French colonialism, which erupted into open armed conflict on November 1, 1954, has now lasted for more than two years. For more than two years, the flame of the people's struggle for freedom and independence has never been extinguished. The Algerian people's anti-repression struggle has been launched throughout the country. They are becoming stronger as they fight, and their heroic struggle is receiving increasingly broad support from peace-loving people all over the world.
    Development of the Military Situation Over the Past Two Years
    For more than two years, the French colonialists have used a large amount of military force to deal with this nation fighting for freedom. They used modern weapons, including aircraft, artillery, tanks, tear gas bombs, and highly lethal shrapnel bombs, and dispatched paratroopers to fight. The number of troops gradually increased from 50,000 at the beginning to more than 500,000, exceeding the forces used by France in World War II. They attempted to drive the Algerian armed forces out of the mountains and forests and annihilate them. Last year, French Governor-General of Algeria, Lacoste, confidently declared that he could complete the "pacification" of Algeria in October. He also repeatedly proclaimed that "pacification" had reached the final hour. But all this became an irony to those who talk big. The position of the French colonialists has not been strengthened, but has become more shaky.
    The terrain of Algeria is as follows: the north is mostly mountainous, with the Atlas Mountains running east-west, and the south is a vast desert with inconvenient transportation. The rainy season in the mountainous area is from October to May every year, and the roads are even more difficult to travel. These conditions are conducive to the development of the struggle of the Algerian people's armed forces, which are far inferior in equipment and numbers. Since November 1954, the areas where military battles have taken place have been constantly expanding, and the areas where disturbances have occurred have also gradually increased.
    Geographically speaking, the development of combat areas has generally progressed from the central part of northern Algeria towards the eastern and western border areas bordering Tunisia and Morocco, and then gradually connected into one piece. At the same time, it has also expanded somewhat from the mountainous areas along the northern coast to the southern plains. As can be seen from the several situation maps on this page, in November-December 1954, when the armed struggle first broke out, the war mainly occurred in the Tizi Ouzou area near the northern coast and the Aurès area in the east bordering Tunisia (see Figure 1). By January 1956, the eastern combat area had developed from Aurès all the way to the Tunisian border and the northern coast. In the west, a new battlefield was opened up in the coastal area west of Tlemcen bordering Morocco. In addition, some areas of unrest appeared near the eastern, western, and central combat areas (see Figure 2). From January to September, these areas continued to expand, and the capital Algiers also began to be threatened by the people's armed forces; at the same time, a new war zone centered on Orléansville appeared between the central and western zones (see Figure 3). From September-October last year to the present, on the one hand, the fighting in the mountainous areas along the coast has continued to develop, with various areas connected to each other, and on the other hand, fighting has also taken place in the area south of Colomb-Béchar (see Figure 4).
    In the past, the resistance movement mainly occurred in the countryside, but now battles have taken place in many cities, including larger cities and their surroundings. In addition to the capital Algiers, cities and their surrounding areas such as Constantine, Bône, and Philippeville in the east, and Oran, Mostaganem, Mascara, and Orléansville in the west, have become areas where battles frequently occur. The battles that took place in the coastal area of Mostaganem-Mascara and east of Oran in mid-September last year, in the Tébessa area in December, in the Constantine area at the end of February this year, and in the Algiers, Oran, Constantine, Kabylie, and areas south of Tébessa since March have been relatively intense.
    The above situation shows that the colonialists' "pacification" policy has suffered a great failure. Cruel suppression has aroused more widespread resistance from the people, more places have experienced unrest, and more areas of unrest have developed into combat areas.
    Colonialist Repression and Resistance
    The French colonialists have been trying to suppress the Algerian national liberation movement. On the one hand, they have adopted so-called "sweeps," "scorched earth policies," and "encirclements and suppressions" against the Algerian armed forces. On the other hand, they have implemented comprehensive terror rule over urban residents, various democratic parties, intellectuals, and peasants, trying to isolate the democratic parties and the national movement under their leadership.
    The colonialists inflict torture and severe punishment on those who are arrested. Many people are imprisoned in concentration camps to suffer, and many are sentenced to death. It is not only men who are arrested and abused, but also women and children. The French colonial authorities have also specially trained a large number of dogs as war dogs and to hunt down criminals. In addition, they have used appeasement and deception to win people over, falsely claiming that they will grant the Algerian people the right to autonomy and implement so-called "revolutionary reforms," etc. They have carried out discord and division among the residents and among various democratic parties and forces, such as propagating discord between the leaders of the National Liberation Front and the National Liberation Army, and propagating that Algerians are divided into two groups, etc. However, all this has been declared bankrupt under the firm resistance of the Algerian people and the exposure and refutation of anti-colonialist forces. The Algerian people continue to fight against the French colonialists with greater confidence and determination.
    At present, the tactics adopted by the National Liberation Army are mainly guerrilla warfare, especially active in the enemy's rear. The armed struggle they are waging is not a simple military combat action, but a mass resistance movement. The armed forces stand at the forefront of the mass movement. In the battles of the past two years, the people's armed forces have continued to grow stronger. Agence France-Presse once estimated that the National Liberation Army had 20,000 people, but leaders of the National Liberation Front abroad announced that this figure was far lower than the actual figure, with some saying it was 100,000. In fact, this is a national movement of the Algerian people. Bouhali, General Secretary of the Algerian Communist Party, said that the three parties, the Algerian Communist Party, the National Liberation Front, and the Algerian National Movement Party, have united all Algerians in carrying out the anti-colonialist struggle. Even the colonialists' own newspaper, the "Republican Oran," had to admit that the National Liberation Army was "easy to recruit personnel."
    Since last year, the Algerian National Liberation Army has made great improvements in its tactics. In many areas, the armed units of the Algerian National Liberation Army have become lighter and more flexible. They avoid large-scale frontal conflicts and adopt attrition and fatigue tactics, constantly using tactics such as explosions, ambushes, and attacks to strike the French army. This makes the French colonial army even more exhausted and fruitless. French Governor-General Lacoste is very troubled by the guerrilla tactics of the National Liberation Army. He recently described it to the National Assembly: "Our enemy is very good at using a small number of people to attack a large number of teams, and adopting decentralized and roundabout tactics in front of organized troops, especially in front of heavily organized troops. Their tactic is to avoid forming a frontal stalemate as much as possible, but when they encounter isolated and scattered squads, they encircle and attack them with superior forces."
    In the Algerian people's armed struggle, the main role is played by the National Liberation Front, which was formed in the armed uprising of November 1954. Its predecessor was the "Party for the Victory of Democratic Freedoms" with a broad mass base, mainly poor peasants and agricultural workers, and the leaders mostly belonged to petty-bourgeois intellectuals. The kidnapping of its five leaders by the French colonialists did not affect the armed struggle of the National Liberation Front. On the contrary, a new Algerian Revolutionary Committee was established not long ago. The underground publication of the "National Liberation Front" has announced the list of seventeen formal members and seventeen alternate members. The leadership includes figures from different political parties. This shows that the National Liberation Front has not only strengthened its leadership, but also expanded the united front.
    The Algerian Communist Party and the National Liberation Front are jointly carrying out a heroic anti-imperialist struggle. Its cooperation with the National Liberation Front and the active fighting spirit of its members have become an important factor in the victorious development of the Algerian people's resistance movement. The "International Handbook" in October 1956 pointed out, "We can say that the Algerian Communist Party plays an important or decisive role in the Algerian uprising."
    The Struggle for Independence and Peace
    The Algerian people were forced to take up arms to resist French violent suppression, but they never refused to achieve their legitimate national aspirations through peaceful negotiations. However, the French colonialists were afraid of losing Algeria and shaking the foundations of their colonialism, so they were unwilling to achieve true peace and give the Algerian people national independence. They wanted to achieve "peace" under the bayonets of France, so that the Algerian people would never get rid of the shackles of colonialism. This is of course unacceptable to the Algerian people.
    The Lille Congress of the French Socialist Party, in its resolution, expressed its desire to peacefully resolve the Algerian issue. The leaders of the Algerian National Liberation Front publicly stated that this resolution could serve as the basis for Franco-Algerian negotiations. However, the French government did not implement the resolution of the Lille Congress, but intensified military suppression and rejected international initiatives for a peaceful settlement. It rejected Nehru's ceasefire proposal and denied the United Nations the right to intervene in the Algerian issue. According to the Tunisian "Action" newspaper, the French government held four negotiations with leaders of the National Liberation Front in Cairo, Rome, Belgrade and other places on April 12, June 11, September 2 and September 12 last year, but ended it by kidnapping the five Algerian leaders headed by Ben Bella. This shows what kind of sincerity the French colonialists have towards peace talks.
    Although Mollet has always emphasized verbally that the French government is willing to ceasefire unconditionally, he also demanded a so-called three-month period of calm, then "free" elections, and then the French government would negotiate with the "qualified representatives" elected. He also attempted to attribute the responsibility for not wanting a ceasefire to the Algerian National Liberation Front. In fact, the so-called unconditional ceasefire is nothing more than a lie. The Mollet government tightly clung to a prerequisite political condition, that is, it did not recognize Algeria's independence.
    The three main parties leading the Algerian people's national liberation struggle (the National Liberation Front, the Algerian National Movement Party, and the Algerian Communist Party) basically agree on the view of peace talks. They all believe that the struggle for peace and the struggle for independence are inseparable. The Algerian Communist Party has always advocated that the Algerian people will never stop the current struggle if they do not obtain the French government's recognition of Algerian national independence. The representative of the National Liberation Front announced on January 11 that France must first recognize Algeria's independence before a ceasefire can be achieved. Mebah, General Secretary of the Algerian National Movement Party, also proposed recognizing the Algerian people's right to self-determination as one of the conditions for achieving a ceasefire.
    Not long ago, when the Mollet government once again launched a propaganda offensive of "ceasefire" and "peace talks" in an attempt to deceive public opinion at home and abroad, the Algerian people immediately expressed their attitude. Debakin, head of the foreign delegation of the National Liberation Front, recently held a press conference in Tunisia and refuted the French colonialists' so-called "free election," believing that "elections are an internal affair, and only Algerians can decide, Algeria's elections have nothing to do with the French government and the United Nations, it is a matter for the Algerian government." He "expressed that the Algerian nation cannot be satisfied with a solution that does not first recognize its independence," "announced that Algerian independence will be the starting point for a rapid ceasefire and effective negotiations to establish new Franco-Algerian relations while respecting the sovereignty of my country..."
    The Algerian people's struggle for independence and peace has received the unanimous support of people all over the world who oppose colonialism and strive for peace. The true solution to the Algerian issue, as French Communist Party Secretary Duclos said, "is only possible on the basis of abandoning colonial relations, recognizing the Algerian people's desire for independence, and on the basis of equal rights and common interests between the two peoples."

    阿尔及利亚人民反殖民主义的武装斗争
    言金
    阿尔及利亚人民反对法国殖民主义者的斗争，自从1954年11月1日爆发为公开的武装冲突以来，到现在已经两年多了。两年多来，人民争取自由和独立的火焰从来没有熄灭。阿尔及利亚人民反镇压的斗争在全国范围开展起来了。他们愈战愈强，他们英勇的斗争得到全世界爱好和平人民日益广泛的支持。
    两年多来军事形势的发展
    两年多来，法国殖民主义者运用大量的兵力来对付这个争取自由的民族，他们使用现代化的武器，除了飞机、大炮、坦克，还有催泪性瓦斯弹和杀伤力很大的榴霰弹，同时出动伞兵作战。兵员数目从开始时的五万人陆续增加到五十万人以上，超过法国在第二次世界大战时使用的兵力。他们企图把阿尔及利亚的武装部队从山林中驱赶下来加以歼灭。法国驻阿尔及利亚总督拉戈斯特去年曾“胸有成竹”地扬言，他在10月间就可以完成对阿尔及利亚的“绥靖”。他也曾好几次宣传说，“绥靖”已到了最后一刻钟。但是这一切都成了对说大话者的讽刺。法国殖民主义者的地位不是强化了，而是更加动摇了。
    阿尔及利亚的地形是：北部多山，东西横贯着阿特拉斯山脉，南部是大沙漠，交通不便。山区每年10月到5月是雨季，道路更难通行。这些条件对在装备和人数上远远处于劣势的阿尔及利亚人民武装的斗争的发展是有利的。从1954年11月到现在，发生军事战斗的地区一直在不断扩大，发生骚动的地区也陆续增加。
    从地理上说，战斗地区发展的情况大体上是从阿尔及利亚北部地区的中央部分向东西两面同突尼斯及摩洛哥接壤的边境地区发展，然后又逐渐连成一片。同时，也从北部海岸多山地区多少向南面平原地带有了扩展。从本版上的几幅形势图可以看出，1954年11—12月，即武装斗争初爆发时，战争主要发生在北部近海的迪西乌祖地区和东面靠近突尼斯边境的奥雷斯地区（见图一）。到了1956年1月，东面的战斗地区从奥雷斯一直发展到突尼斯边境和北面海岸。西面在得雷姆桑以西同摩洛哥接境的海岸地区又开辟了新的战场。此外，在东、西、中三个战斗地区附近出现了一些骚动地区（见图二）。从1月到9月，这些地区都继续扩展，首都阿尔及尔也开始受到了人民武装的威胁；同时在中、西两区之间又出现了以奥尔良城为中心的新战区（见图三）。从去年9—10月到现在的时期中，一方面是由于沿海多山地带的战斗继续开展，各个地区互相连接起来，同时稍南在科伦培沙以南的地区也发生战斗（见图四）。
    过去，抵抗运动主要发生在乡村，现在许多城市包括较大的城市及其附近也都发生了战斗。除了首都阿尔及尔，还有东部的君士但丁、博纳、斐利普城，西部的阿兰、莫斯达卡楠、马斯卡拉、奥尔良城等城市及其附近，都成为经常发生战斗的地区。去年9月中在莫斯达卡楠—马斯卡拉沿海地区及阿兰以东地区，12月在特伯沙地区，今年2月底在君士但丁地区，3月以来在阿尔及尔、阿兰、君士但丁、卡比利以及特伯沙以南地区发生的战斗都是比较紧张的。
    以上情形说明了殖民主义者的“绥靖”政策已经遭到极大的失败。残酷的镇压引起了人民更普遍的反抗，在更多的地方出现了骚动，同时有更多的骚动地区发展为战斗地区了。
    殖民者的镇压和反抗
    法国殖民主义者一直企图把阿尔及利亚的民族解放运动镇压下去，他们一方面对阿尔及利亚的武装部队采用所谓“扫荡”“焦土政策”“围剿”等，另一方面对城市居民、各民主党派、知识分子、农民等施行了全面的恐怖统治，想使各民主党派及其领导下的民族运动陷于孤立。
    对于遭受逮捕的人，殖民主义者一律施以酷刑，给以严重的处罚，许多人被关在集中营里受罪，也有不少被判处死刑，被拘捕虐待的不只是男子，还有妇女和儿童。法国殖民当局还特别训练了大批狼犬作为战犬和追捕犯人之用。此外，又用怀柔和欺骗的手段来笼络人心，假说要给阿尔及利亚人民以自治权利以及实行所谓“革命性的改革措施”等等。他们在居民中间，在各民主党派和势力中间进行离间和分化，如宣传民族解放阵线同民族解放军的领袖不和，宣传阿尔及利亚人分为两个集团等等。但是这一切在阿尔及利亚人民的坚决反抗和反殖民主义力量的揭露驳斥之下都宣告破产了。阿尔及利亚人以更高的信心和决心继续进行反对法国殖民者的斗争。
    现今，民族解放军采取的战术主要是游击战，尤其在敌人的后方活动频繁。他们所进行的武装斗争不是单纯的军事战斗行动，而是群众性的抵抗运动。武装部队站在群众运动的最前列。在两年多的战斗中，人民武装力量不断壮大起来。法新社曾估计民族解放军有两万人，但在国外的民族阵线领袖宣布这个数字远低于实际数字，有人说是十万人。实际上，这是阿尔及利亚人民的一个全民运动。阿尔及利亚共产党总书记布哈利说，阿尔及利亚共产党、民族解放阵线、阿尔及利亚民族运动党这三个党派团结了全体阿尔及利亚人在进行反殖民主义的斗争。连殖民主义者自己的报刊“共和阿兰报”也不得不承认民族解放军是“容易征集人员”的。
    去年以来，阿尔及利亚民族解放军在战术方面有了很大的改进。在许多地区，阿尔及利亚民族解放军的武装单位改变得更轻便、更灵活，他们避免大规模的正面冲突，采用消耗和疲劳战术，不断用爆炸、伏击、袭击等战术来打击法军。这更使法国殖民军疲于奔命，劳师无功。法国总督拉戈斯特对民族解放军的游击战术是很感头痛的，他最近在国民议会上这样描写道：“我们的敌人非常善于利用以少数人攻击数量众多的队伍，在有组织的军队面前，尤其在编制笨重的军队面前，采用分散、迂回的作战方法。他们的战术是用一切方法避免形成正面相持的阵地战，但碰到孤立的分散小队时则以优势的兵力加以围击。”
    在阿尔及利亚的人民武装斗争中，起主要作用的是民族解放阵线，它是1954年11月武装起义中组成的组织，它的前身是“争取民主自由胜利党”有广泛的群众基础，主要是贫农和农业工人，领导者则多数属于小资产阶级的知识分子。它的五名领袖被法国殖民者绑架后并没有使民族解放阵线的武装斗争受到影响，相反地，不久前成立了新的阿尔及利亚革命委员会。“民族解放阵线”的地下刊物已宣布了十七个正式委员和十七个候补委员的名单。领导机构包括不同政治党派的人物。这说明民族解放阵线不仅加强了领导，也扩大了统一阵线。
    阿尔及利亚共产党和民族解放阵线共同进行着英勇的反帝斗争，它和民族解放阵线的合作和它的党员们的积极战斗精神成为阿尔及利亚人民抵抗运动胜利发展的一个重要因素。1956年10月份的“国际手册”指出，“我们可以说阿尔及利亚共产党在阿尔及利亚的起义中起着重要的或决定性的作用。”
    争取独立与和平的斗争
    阿尔及利亚人民被迫拿起武器来抵抗法国的暴力镇压，但他们从来不拒绝通过和平的谈判来实现他们正当的民族愿望。可是，法国殖民主义者害怕失去阿尔及利亚，动摇他们殖民主义的基础，因此不愿实现真正的和平而给阿尔及利亚人民以民族独立。他们想要实现在法国刺刀底下的“和平”，使阿尔及利亚人民永远摆脱不了殖民主义的枷锁。这当然是阿尔及利亚人民所决不能接受的。
    法国社会党的里尔代表大会，在它的决议中曾表示要和平解决阿尔及利亚问题。阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线的领袖公开声明，这项决议可以作为法、阿谈判的基础。但是法国政府并没有执行里尔代表大会的决议，却加紧了军事镇压，还拒绝国际上关于和平解决的创议。它拒绝了尼赫鲁提出的停火建议，也否认联合国有权干预阿尔及利亚问题。据突尼斯“行动报”报道，法国政府曾在去年4月12日、6月11日、9月2日和9月12日同民族解放阵线领袖在开罗、罗马、贝尔格莱德等地进行了四次谈判，最后却以绑架以本·贝拉为首的五位阿尔及利亚领袖来结束它。这就说明了法国殖民主义者对和平谈判怀有什么样的诚意。
    摩勒虽然口头上一直强调法国政府愿意无条件地停火，同时却要求有所谓三个月的平静期，然后进行“自由”选举，再由法国政府同由选举产生的“有资格的代表”进行谈判。他还企图把不愿停火的责任归到阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线方面。事实上，所谓无条件的停火不过是一种谎言，摩勒政府紧紧地拖住了一个先决的政治条件，即不承认阿尔及利亚的独立。
    领导着阿尔及利亚人民进行民族解放斗争的三个主要党派（民族解放阵线、阿尔及利亚民族运动党和阿尔及利亚共产党）对和谈的看法基本上是一致的，他们都认为争取和平与争取独立是不能分割的。阿尔及利亚共产党一向主张，如果不取得法国政府对阿尔及利亚民族独立的承认，阿尔及利亚人民就决不停止当前的斗争。民族解放阵线的代表曾于1月11日宣布，法国必须首先承认阿尔及利亚的独立，才有可能实现停火。阿尔及利亚民族运动党总书记默巴也提出承认阿尔及利亚人民的自决权利作为实现停火的条件之一。
    不久以前，当摩勒政府再一次发动“停火”“和谈”的宣传攻势，企图以此欺骗法国内外舆论的时候，阿尔及利亚人民立刻表明了自己的态度。民族解放阵线国外代表团团长德巴金最近在突尼斯举行记者招待会时驳斥了法国殖民者所谓“自由选举”的说法，认为“选举是内政问题，只有阿尔及利亚人才能决定，阿尔及利亚的选举与法国政府和联合国无关，它是阿尔及利亚政府的事情”。他“表示阿尔及利亚民族不能满足于一个不首先承认它的独立的解决方案”，“宣布阿尔及利亚独立将是通过迅速停火和在尊重我国家主权的情况下为建立新的法、阿关系而进行有效谈判的起点……”
    阿尔及利亚人民争取独立与和平的斗争，得到全世界反对殖民主义和争取和平的人民的一致支持。阿尔及利亚问题的真正解决，将如法共书记杜克洛所说：“只有在放弃殖民主义关系、承认阿尔及利亚人民的独立愿望、在两国人民的权利平等、共同利益的基础上才有可能。”
