    The family should care about their belongings
    Jin Fang's odd-job worker Tian Furong loves the factory like his home
    (Our newspaper's news) According to the Lüda Daily: In the Jinzhou Textile Factory, from 1953 until now, regardless of wind or rain, every morning before people go to work, there is a tall old worker, holding a blue cloth bag, squatting in front of the trash can, picking up things thrown away by the workers. This old worker is called Tian Furong, and he is an odd-job worker in the raw material and finished product section.
    Talking about his turning over trash cans to pick up scraps is a long story. It was on a Sunday in 1953, when he and everyone went to the Tianqi Temple fair in Jin County. When he walked to the north gate of Jinzhou City, he was attracted by a sundry stall. It turned out that some screws, belts, shuttles, leather covers, small car wheels, and other machine parts displayed on these stalls were all parts from weaving machines and spinning machines. Tian Furong squatted down and picked up a small belt to look at it. It was not new, but old. He thought: Why did it end up here? From that day on, he observed at all times and places. After another half month or so, one day, when he came out of the factory and passed Beiheyan, he saw several people surrounded by a pile of dirty soil from afar, arguing: "Did you contract for all of it?" "Anyway, it's at my door!" One of them pointed at another and said, "You've picked up two big oxen just from Da Huang Niu in the past few years. Can't we pick up a little donkey?" (It is said that this family bought two big oxen just by picking up machine parts thrown out by Jin Fang.) Another person said: "This is something thrown out by Jin Fang, it's not yours, you have to let me pick it!" Tian Furong hurriedly stepped forward to take a look. It turned out that many people were picking things from the dirty soil pile. Among them, one old woman was the one he saw at the temple fair selling broken things. Their baskets were full of small machine parts, wooden tubes, small thread ends... So that's where the loophole was! From then on, he came early and left late every day, turning over all the trash cans in the factory, picking out machine parts, cotton, yarn, wooden tubes, etc. from the trash, and then storing them separately, sending them to whichever workshop could use them.
    In addition to suggesting to the branch and workshop cadres that they should not sweep these things into the trash, he also carried the picked-up things several times to find the factory director to make suggestions. The factory director only praised him, but did not take any measures. Tian Furong was very dissatisfied. One day, he walked into the factory director's office and shouted: "Director Liu! Come on, go take a look, they (referring to the workshops) threw away so many good rubber belts and parts, why don't you care?" Because he repeatedly made suggestions to the factory director, he finally aroused the factory director's attention. The factory concentrated the trash in the trash cans of all the branches and workshops in the factory, and waited until the useful things were picked out before pulling them out of the factory. Even so, Tian Furong was still not at ease, and often took advantage of the opportunity of the factory holding production meetings to send the things he had picked up in the past few days to the factory director, asking the factory director to bring them up at the meeting, requesting them to educate the workers not to sweep the state property into the trash cans again.
    Under Tian Furong's influence, the factory and workshops strengthened the management of material use. Since then, the useful things left in the trash cans have gradually decreased, but they have not disappeared completely. He still goes to each trash can early every morning to pick it over. Exactly how much stuff the factory has pulled out of the trash in the past few years, even the accountant cannot calculate this account. In 1956 alone, he recovered more than 2,000 yuan in losses for the country. Because Tian Furong loves the factory like his home, his name has been written on the honor roll of advanced workers for two consecutive years. He said: The family must care about their property.

    当家人要关心自己的家当
    金纺杂务工田福荣爱厂如家
    本报讯　据旅大日报报道：在金州纺织厂里，从1953年到现在，不管刮风下雨，每天早晨当人们还没有上班的时候，便有一个高个子老工人，拿着一个青布包，蹲在垃圾箱子跟前，拣着被工人扔掉的东西。这个老工人叫田福荣，是原料成品科的一个杂务工。
    提起他翻垃圾箱拣破烂的事来，话可就长了。那是1953年的一个星期天，他和大伙去逛金县天齐庙庙会，当他走到金州城的北门口，就被一个杂货摊子吸引住了。原来这些摊子上摆的一些螺丝、皮带、梭子、皮套、小车轱辘等机器零件都是织布机和细纱机上的零件。田福荣蹲下来拾起一根小皮带看了看，不是新的而是旧的。他想：为什么弄到这里来了呢？从那天起，他随时随地观察，又过了半个多月，有一天，他从工厂出来路过北河沿时，老远就看见几个人围着一堆脏土在吵嚷：“你都包下了么？”“反正是在我的门口！”其中一个人指着另一个人说：“这几年光大黄牛叫你拣了两头，我们拣个小毛驴还不行么？”（据说这一户人家光拣金纺扔出来的机器零件就买了两头大黄牛）又一个人说：“这是金纺扔出来的东西，不是你的，就得让我拣！”田福荣急忙走上前去一看，原来是许多人在从脏土堆里拣东西，其中有一个老婆正是在庙会上看见的那个摆破烂摊的，她们的筐子里尽是小机器零件呀，木管呀，小线穗子呀……原来漏洞就在这里呀！从此，他就每天早来晚走，把工厂里所有的垃圾箱翻弄它一遍，把垃圾里的机器零件、棉花、纱、木管等拣出来，然后分门别类的保存起来，哪个车间能用得上就送给哪个车间去使用。
    他除了向分场和车间干部提出要他们不把这些东西扫到垃圾里以外，还曾经几次地背着拣来的东西去找厂长提意见。厂长只是表扬了他一下，却没采取措施。田福荣很不满。有一天，他走进厂长办公室就喊：“刘厂长！走，你去看看去，他们（指车间）把那么些好胶皮带和零件都扔啦，你为什么也不去管管？”由于他一再向厂长提意见，终于引起了厂长的重视，厂方把全厂各分场和车间的垃圾箱里的垃圾集中在一起，等到把有用的东西挑拣出来以后再往厂外边拉。虽然是这样，田福荣还不放心，经常趁厂部召开生产会议的机会，把自己近几天拣的东西送给厂长，让厂长在会议上向干部提出来，要求他们教育工人不要再把国家财产扫到垃圾箱里。
    在田福荣的影响下，工厂和车间加强了材料使用的管理，从此丢在垃圾箱里的有用的东西就逐渐减少了，不过并没有绝迹。他每天仍然一早到各个垃圾箱里拣它一遍。究竟工厂几年来从垃圾里拉出去了多少东西，连会计也无法算这个账。仅1956年一年，他就为国家挽回了二千多元的损失。田福荣因为爱厂如家，他的名字曾连续两年被写在先进工作者的光荣册上。他说：当家人不能不关心自己的财产。（附图片）
