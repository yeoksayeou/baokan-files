    Fire Bean Trees Can Produce Glucose and Vitamins
    (Our dispatch) Recently, fire bean trees (local name) that can produce glucose and vitamins were discovered in the subtropical area of Baoshan County, Yunnan. They grow like forests on the subtropical slopes, and it is estimated that there are three million trees in the county. These trees, the large ones being arm-span thick and several dozen feet tall, have grey trunks. The fire bean fruit is about the size of a pigeon egg, oval in shape, and each tree can yield about 300 jin. In addition to Baoshan County, they are also commonly found in the subtropical mountainous areas of Dehong.
    In the past, these fire beans used to make glucose and vitamins were mostly imported from abroad. This year alone, more than 60,000 jin have been purchased in Mengboluo, Shangjiang and other places. Some farmers who pick fire beans earn more than 500 yuan, which is much more than they earn from growing coffee.
    Fire bean trees can be propagated by cuttings. Now, the local leading organs have designated the fire bean forests in these areas to be managed by the agricultural cooperatives, in order to prevent them from being destroyed by wildfires.

    火豆树能制葡萄糖和维他命
    本报讯　最近在云南保山县的亚热带地区，发现了能制葡萄糖和维他命的火豆树（当地名称）。它像森林一样的生长在亚热带的山坡上，估计全县有三百万棵。这种树，大者合抱粗，高有数丈，树干为灰色，火豆果像鸽蛋大小，系椭圆形，每棵树可收三百斤左右。除保山县外，德宏的亚热带山区也普遍生长。
    过去，这种制葡萄糖和维他命的火豆，多从国外进口；今年，仅在猛波罗、上江等地就收购了六万多斤。有的农民采摘火豆，就收入到五百多元，比种咖啡收入还要大得多。
    火豆树插枝即可成活。现在，当地领导机关已把这些地区的火豆林子，划归农业社经营管理，以免野火烧毁。
