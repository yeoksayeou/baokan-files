Matters Needing Attention in Current Agricultural Production
Save the Waterwheels!

At present, agricultural cooperatives in some areas are neglecting the maintenance of waterwheels. Damage and loss of parts are constantly occurring, and some even destroy waterwheels and well cones to sell them as scrap iron. For example, in Dingxian, Mancheng, and Anguo counties, Hebei Province, out of a total of 61,000 waterwheels, 10,711 are damaged or missing parts. According to a survey of 19 villages in Qingyuan, Tangxian, and Anguo counties, from mid-November last year to January 8 this year, a total of 49 waterwheels were smashed, more than 2,300 waterwheel buckets, more than 5,300 waterwheel axles, 17 water winnowers, 61 pipes, and 18 sets of chains were dismantled and sold. Two blacksmith shops and a scrap metal dealer in Chengguan Town, Anguo County, bought 33 complete waterwheels and more than 2,000 waterwheel buckets, as well as some broken waterwheel scrap iron, in just over ten days. … Without waterwheels, how can we irrigate the land? How much will this hinder the effort to achieve a bumper harvest!

Why is this strange phenomenon happening? The main reason is that agricultural cooperative cadres in these areas do not pay enough attention to water conservancy tools and have not assigned specific personnel to be responsible for their safekeeping. Some cooperatives, although they have assigned specific personnel for management, have not established strict safekeeping systems. Some cooperative members also do not cherish public property enough. Another reason is that many agricultural cooperatives have not priced the waterwheels that members have handed over to the cooperative, the price is too low, or there is no stipulation on the time limit for payment, so some members are unwilling to contribute their waterwheels to the cooperative and sell them instead. Individual cooperative cadres, fearing that waterwheels would be transferred to other villages after the large cooperatives were divided into smaller ones, dismantled and smashed waterwheels to sell the iron. Some purchasing departments, indiscriminately purchasing waterwheels and waterwheel parts, have also fueled the destruction of waterwheels.

In order to stop this serious phenomenon of destroying waterwheels, agricultural cooperatives in various regions should, in conjunction with current production, conduct a general inspection of the existing water-lifting tools in the cooperative, formulate strict safekeeping systems, and designate specific personnel to be responsible for management. At the same time, it is necessary to better educate cooperative members on cherishing public property. Those cooperative members and cadres who cherish and maintain water-lifting tools well should be appropriately commended and rewarded; those negligent custodians and cooperative members who damage public property should also be given necessary criticism and education according to the specific circumstances; individual thieves and saboteurs should be given due punishment according to the specific circumstances. If the price of waterwheels contributed to the cooperative is too low, it should be appropriately increased; for those contributed to the cooperative without pricing, the price should be negotiated with the owners or they should be rented; if the price has been set but not paid, efforts should be made to return part of it first based on the economic conditions of each cooperative (if the cooperative is indeed unable to repay, the reasons should be explained to the owners and an agreement should be made on the date of future repayment). Waterwheels that have already been purchased by supply and marketing cooperatives should be repaired if possible and sold in a timely manner.

### 当前农业生产上应注意的事情  救救水车！

    当前农业生产上应注意的事情
    救救水车！
    目前有些地区的农业社忽视了水车的保管工作，损坏和丢失零件的事情不断发生，甚至把水车、井锥毁掉当作废铁出卖。如河北省定县、满城、安国等三个县，共有水车六万一千架，损坏和丢失零件的就有一万零七百一十一架。另据清苑、唐县、安国三个县十九个村的调查，从去年11月中旬到今年1月8日，共砸毁水车四十九架，拆卖水车斗子两千三百多个、水车轴五千三百多根、水簸箕十七个、管子六十一节、链子十八付。安国县城关镇的两个铁匠炉和一个收烂铁的小商贩，在短短的十几天内，就收买了三十三架整套水车、两千多个水车斗子，还有一部分砸坏的水车烂铁。……没有了水车，怎样浇地呢？这会给争取大丰收造成多大障碍啊！
    为什么会发生这种奇怪的现象？主要原因是这些地区的农业社干部对水利工具重视不足，没有确定专人负责保管；有些社虽然确定了专人管理，但没有规定严格的保管制度；有些社员对公共财物也不够爱护。还有一个原因是：不少农业社对于社员交给社里的水车没有作价、作价偏低或没有规定给钱的年限，一些社员不愿把水车入社而卖掉了。个别社干部怕大社划小以后再给外村调水车，也就拆、砸水车卖铁。一些收购部门，不加区别地把水车和水车零件一律收购，也助长了毁坏水车的情况。
    为了制止这种破坏水车的严重现象，各地农业社应该结合当前生产，对社内现有提水工具进行一次普遍的检查，制定严格的保管制度，并指定专人负责管理。同时，要更好地对社员进行爱护公共财产的教育。对于那些爱护和保管好提水工具的社员和干部，要进行适当的表扬和奖励；对于失职的保管人员以及损坏公共财物的社员，也要根据具体情况给以必要的批评教育；对于个别的偷盗分子、破坏分子，应根据具体情节给以应得的惩罚。水车入社作价偏低的，应适当提高；入社而没作价的，要和车主协商作价或租用；已作好价而没有给钱的，要根据各社的经济条件争取先归还一部分（如社内确实无力偿还，也应很好向车主说明原因，并约定以后归还日期）。供销社已经买进的水车，能修理好的应当加以修理，及时出售出去。
