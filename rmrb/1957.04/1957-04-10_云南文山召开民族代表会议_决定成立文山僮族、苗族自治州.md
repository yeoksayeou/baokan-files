    Yunnan's Wenshan Convenes Ethnic Representatives Meeting
    Decides to Establish Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture
    (Our newspaper's Kunming dispatch on the 9th) The "Preparatory Committee for the Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture" in Yunnan has been established.
    The Wenshan Special District is a multi-ethnic area, with ethnic minorities accounting for 56.5% of the total population. In order to further strengthen ethnic unity and better develop the political, economic, and cultural undertakings of all ethnic groups, 818 representatives of all ethnic groups convened an ethnic representative meeting in Wenshan from March 28th to April 1st to study the establishment of an autonomous prefecture. The representatives at the meeting enthusiastically discussed issues such as ethnic affiliation, the name of the autonomous prefecture, and how to prepare for the establishment of the autonomous prefecture.
    The meeting unanimously agreed to abolish the unreasonable ethnic names that were caused in the past by historical class oppression, ethnic discrimination, and geographical environment, restore the inherent names of the ethnic groups, retain the self-designations of the ethnic groups, and merge them according to the ethnic branches. After research and discussion, the meeting believed that the Nong, Sha, Tu, Tianbao, Long'an, and Hei ethnic groups belong to the Zhuang ethnic system, and the true names of the Minjia and Duyun ethnic groups are Bai. As for the Yang and Yang ethnic groups, the representatives of these ethnic groups agreed to be affiliated with the Zhuang ethnic system, but further research is still needed.
    Based on the above affiliation situation and in accordance with the spirit of the "Outline for the Implementation of Ethnic Regional Autonomy of the People's Republic of China," all representatives unanimously agreed to name it the "Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture." The meeting elected 53 people to form the "Preparatory Committee for the Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture," with Luo Yuntong (Zhuang) as the chairman, Ma Shenshen (Han), Long Mingchuan (Miao), and twelve others as vice-chairmen, and Wu Chengyuan (Miao), Nong Huilian (Zhuang, female), and forty others as members.

    云南文山召开民族代表会议
    决定成立文山僮族、苗族自治州
    本报昆明9日电　云南“文山僮族、苗族自治州筹备委员会”成立。
    文山专区是一个多民族的地区，少数民族占全区人口的56.5％。为了进一步加强民族团结，更好地发展各民族的政治、经济和文化事业，各族八百一十八个代表于3月28日至4月1日在文山召开了民族代表会议，研究了建立自治州问题。到会代表热烈的讨论了民族归系、自治州名称及如何筹备成立自治州等问题。
    会议一致同意把过去由于历史上阶级压迫、民族歧视及地理环境等造成的不合理的民族名称取消，恢复本民族固有的名称，保留本民族的自称，按民族支系进行归并。经过研究和讨论，会议认为侬、沙、土、天保、龙安、黑等民族属于僮族系统，民家族和都匀族的真名称是白族。至于洋族和秧族，本民族代表同意归僮族系，但还需进一步研究。
    根据以上归系情况，和依照中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要规定的精神，全体代表一致同意定名为“文山僮族、苗族自治州”。会议选出五十三人组成了“文山僮族、苗族自治州筹备委员会”，由罗运通（僮族）任主任委员，马生申（汉族）、龙明传（苗族）等十二人任副主任委员，吴成元（苗族）、侬惠莲（僮族，女）等四十人为委员。
