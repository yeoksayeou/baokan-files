The CPC Central Committee calls on all rural work cadres to participate in production and lead production.
The CPC Central Committee transmits the Fujian Provincial Committee's transmission of the Longxi Prefectural Committee's "Report on District and Township Cadres and Commune Cadres Participating in Production, Leading Production, and Improving Leadership Style."
Shanghai Bureau, Party Committees of all provinces, cities, and districts:
The Longxi Prefectural Committee of Fujian's "Report on District and Township Cadres and Commune Cadres Participating in Production, Leading Production, and Improving Leadership Style" and the Fujian Provincial Committee's instructions are very good. Please be sure to read them and follow their example. This report proves that the simple act of cadres "taking off their shoes and going into the fields" has brought about great changes in the rural production landscape. This style of sharing weal and woe with the peasants is a fine tradition of our Party for many years. As long as the leadership pays attention to promoting it, we will certainly be able to win the enthusiastic support of the peasant masses, just as we did during the revolutionary war and land reform period, thereby running the cooperatives well and promoting the great development of agricultural production. Therefore, the Party Committees of all provinces, cities, and districts should call on all cadres engaged in rural work to go deep among the masses and implement the method of participating in production and leading production, overcoming the extremely harmful bureaucratic, subjectivist, and commandist work styles.

Important Measures to Change Cadre Work Style
The CPC Fujian Provincial Committee transmits the Longxi Prefectural Committee's "Report on District and Township Cadres and Commune Cadres Participating in Production, Leading Production, and Improving Leadership Style" to all localities, cities, counties, and district committees, and reports to the Central Committee:
The Longxi Prefectural Committee's report of March 10 on district and township cadres and commune cadres participating in production, leading production, and improving leadership style is very good, and is hereby forwarded to all localities, cities, counties, and district committees.
Improve the relationship between cadres and the masses, increase knowledge of leading production
I.  Township cadres and commune cadres participating in production and leading production is a very important step in improving the relationship between cadres and the masses and changing the work style of cadres. Not only should township cadres and commune cadres do this, but county and district cadres and work teams stationed in townships should also do this. When county heads, county party secretaries, district heads, district party secretaries, and comrades of work teams go to townships to lead production, they should first participate in production. This not only has a great impact on the masses, but also can increase comrades' knowledge of leading production, overcome the lack of and ignorance of production knowledge of many of our comrades (who have never farmed before), and avoid or reduce some mistakes in the work of leading agricultural cooperative production. It should be made clear to all cadres that participating in production is for the purpose of leading production.
Listen to the beneficial experience of veteran farmers, correct unrealistic shortcomings
II. Another important experience in improving the leadership methods of township-level and agricultural cooperatives, district, county, and provincial-level leaders in agricultural production is that when responsible comrades and work teams (including business departments) above the district level go to the countryside to inspect and lead production, they should not only talk with township cadres, commune cadres, and party branch comrades, but also visit local experienced veteran farmers or hold forums for veteran farmers. This way, they can listen to the beneficial experience of veteran farmers, supplement our lack of knowledge, especially the lack of knowledge of "adapting to local conditions." They can discover and correct some problems in the leadership of production by our leadership organs at all levels (such as production plans and production measures) that are unrealistic and therefore cause dissatisfaction among the masses.
And every agricultural cooperative should hire experienced veteran farmers as production consultants and establish a production advisory committee. Most commune cadres are young, enthusiastic, but lack production experience, especially local beneficial historical experience and habits. Therefore, commune cadres should be educated to cooperate well with veteran farmers, humbly listen to and study the experience and opinions of veteran farmers, and not easily despise veteran farmers as "backward" or "conservative." It is even more important to guard against using a rude attitude and easily labeling people with the big hat of "reactionary" or "saboteur."
Reduce meetings for grassroots cadres
III. The third very important issue in improving work style is that meetings should be reduced, especially meetings for district and township cadres. Do not summon non-detached or semi-detached grassroots cadres to counties or districts for meetings, and detached grassroots cadres and district cadres should also not be frequently summoned to meetings. Townships can adopt the method of detached township cadres taking turns on duty, or half-day office work and half-day production, or two days of office work and one day of public affairs. All localities should pay attention to exploring, creating, and promoting experience in this regard.
Prohibit gambling and eliminate bad habits
IV. Gambling should be strictly prohibited in rural areas. It has been found in many places that gambling (open gambling, secret gambling, playing poker openly but gambling secretly, etc.) is prevalent. Peasants are very dissatisfied with the government's failure to prohibit gambling and the sale of poker by department stores in rural areas. The prevalence of gambling in rural areas not only hinders production but also easily encourages bad habits. County and district governments or township governments should issue orders to prohibit gambling, and agricultural cooperatives and the Communist Youth League should prohibit gambling. This is the demand of the peasants and is a popular thing to do, and all localities should vigorously promote it. Department stores and supply and marketing cooperatives should not sell poker in rural areas. Playing poker has become a common practice in many idle government units in rural areas and cities and should be prohibited.
The above is for your study and promotion to facilitate pushing the current spring plowing and production to a climax and strive for a bumper harvest this year.

    中共中央号召所有农村工作干部参加生产领导生产
    中共中央批转福建省委批转龙溪地委“关于区乡干部社干部参加生产领导生产和改进领导作风的报告”
    上海局、各省、市、区党委：
    福建龙溪地委“关于区乡干部社干部参加生产领导生产和改进领导作风的报告”和福建省委的批语都很好，请你们务必看一看，并且应该仿行。从这个报告中证明，仅仅是干部“脱鞋下田”一件事，就引起农村生产面貌的很大变化，而这种与农民同甘苦的作风，是我党多年来的优良传统，只要领导上注意发扬它，我们就一定能够像过去革命战争和土改时期一样，取得农民群众的热烈拥护，从而把合作社办好，促进农业生产的大发展。因此，各省、市、区党委都应该号召所有农村工作的干部深入群众，实现参加生产领导生产的方法，克服极其有害的官僚主义、主观主义、命令主义的作风。
           中央　　1957年4月25日
    改变干部作风的重要措施
    中共福建省委批转龙溪地委“关于区乡干部社干部参加生产领导生产和改进领导作风的报告”各地、市、县、区委并报中央：
    龙溪地委3月10日关于区乡干部社干部参加生产领导生产和改进领导作风的报告很好，兹转发各地、市、县、区委。
    改善干部和群众关系  增进领导生产的知识
    一、乡干部、社干部参加生产领导生产是改善干群关系，改变干部作风很重要的一着。不仅乡干部、社干部应这样做，县、区干部和下乡驻乡的工作组也应该这样做。县长、县委书记，区长、区委书记和工作组的同志下乡去领导生产，首先就在参加生产，这不仅对群众的影响很大，而且可以增进同志们领导生产的知识，可以克服我们目前不少的同志（过去完全没有种过田的）对生产知识的缺乏和无知，在领导农业合作社生产的工作中，避免或少犯一些错误。应该向所有的干部说明白：参加生产就是为了领导生产。
    听取老农有益的经验  纠正不合实际的缺点
    二、改善乡级和农业社，区、县、地、省级领导农业生产的领导方法的另一条重要经验，就是区以上的负责同志和工作组（包括业务部门）下乡检查和领导生产，不仅要同乡干部、社干部、党支部同志谈话，还一定要访问当地生产有经验的老农或召开老农座谈会，这样就能听取老农有益的经验，补助我们知识之不足，特别是“因地制宜”知识之不足。就能发现和纠正我们各级领导机关在领导生产中（例如生产计划和生产措施）一些不合实际情况因而引起群众不满的一些毛病。
    而每一个农业社都应该聘请有经验的老农当生产顾问，成立生产顾问委员会。社干部多数是青年，有热情，但缺乏生产经验，特别是当地有益的历史经验和习惯。因此，要教育社干部好好和老农合作，虚心听取和研究老农的经验和意见，对老农不要动辄就以“落后”、“保守”轻视之，更切戒以粗暴的态度，轻易以“反动”、“破坏”的大帽子扣人。
    减少基层干部的会议
    三、改进工作作风的第三个很重要的问题就是应该减少会议，特别要减少区、乡干部的会议。不要召集不脱产或半脱产的基层干部到县、到区开会，脱产的基层干部和区干部也不要频繁的召集开会。乡里采取脱产乡干部轮流值日或半天办公半天生产或两天办一天公的办法均可采行，各地还应在这方面注意摸索创造经验推广之。
    禁止赌博消除不良风气
    四、乡村应厉行禁赌。不少地方发现赌博（公开赌、秘密赌，明打扑克暗是赌博等等），农民对政府不禁赌和百货公司在农村中推销扑克很不满。农村赌博流行，既妨碍生产，又易助长不良风气，县、区政府或乡政府应下令禁赌，农业社和青年团应该禁赌，这是农民的要求，是得人心的事，各地应大力推行。百货公司、供销社不应该在农村推销扑克。在农村中以及城市中许多工作不忙的机关单位打扑克成风，应该禁止。
    以上请各地加以研究和推广，以利于把当前春耕生产推向高潮，争取今年大丰收。
