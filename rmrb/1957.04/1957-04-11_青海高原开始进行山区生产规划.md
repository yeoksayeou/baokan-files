Xinhua News Agency Report: A mountain production planning work team composed of more than sixty agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, water conservancy, and surveying technicians has begun mountain production planning work in Huangyuan County. This is the beginning of comprehensive planning and development of mountainous areas on the Qinghai Plateau.

The work team will "take the township as the unit and the agricultural cooperative as the foundation" to complete the planning of land utilization, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, water conservancy, and soil and water conservation in various townships of Huangyuan County for the next five years. It will then summarize experience and run training courses to cultivate cadres and accumulate experience for the comprehensive planning work in the mountainous areas of Qinghai agricultural regions next year.

About 80% of the land in the agricultural areas of the Qinghai Plateau belongs to mountainous areas. Due to insufficient attention to mountainous areas in the past, mountain production technology is still relatively backward, and land utilization is unreasonable and wasteland is very serious. In order to gradually change the poor situation in the mountainous areas and improve the production and living standards of the people of all ethnic groups in the mountainous areas, Qinghai Province recently established a Mountain Production Planning Committee to unify the leadership of mountain production and comprehensively plan and develop the mountainous areas.

    青海高原开始进行山区生产规划
    据新华社讯　六十多名农业、林业、畜牧业、水利和测量技术干部组成的山区生产规划工作队，在湟源县开始进行山区生产规划工作。这是青海高原上综合规划和开发山区工作的开端。
    工作队将“以乡为单位，以农业社为基础”，在今年内完成湟源县各个乡今后五年中的土地利用、农业、林业、畜牧、水利、及水土保持等方面的规划工作，然后总结经验，开办训练班，为明年在青海农业区的山区全面开展规划工作培养干部和积累经验。
    青海高原上的农业区约有80％的土地属于山区。由于过去对山区工作重视不够，目前山区生产技术仍然比较落后，土地利用不合理和荒废现象很严重。为了逐渐改变山区贫困面貌，提高山区各族人民的生产和生活水平，青海省最近成立了山区生产规划委员会，统一领导山区生产，全面规划和综合开发山区。
