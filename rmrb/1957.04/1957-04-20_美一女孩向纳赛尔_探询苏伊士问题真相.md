An American Girl Inquires of Nasser About the Truth of the Suez Crisis

(AFP) — It is reported that a fifteen-year-old girl from Park City, USA, wrote to Egyptian President Nasser a month ago, requesting fair documents about the Suez Canal issue, because she believes she cannot obtain such documents in the United States. She said that she needs such documents for her world modern history course.

Now, the American girl has received a reply signed by President Nasser. In the reply, President Nasser expressed his gratitude to the girl for writing to him, and told her that some of the news about the Suez Canal issue she read in American newspapers was "distorted fabrication," because Egypt's enemies wanted to "prompt American public opinion to condemn Egypt."

    美一女孩向纳赛尔
    探询苏伊士问题真相
    本报讯　据法新社消息，美国公园城的一个十五岁的女孩子在一个月前写信给埃及总统纳赛尔，要求给她有关苏伊士运河问题的公正的文件，因为她认为她在美国得不到这样的文件。她说，她学习世界现代史这门功课需要这样的文件。
    现在，这个美国女孩子收到了纳赛尔总统署名的复信。在复信中，纳赛尔总统对这个女孩给他写信表示感谢，并且告诉她说，她在美国报纸上读到的关于苏伊士运河问题的一些消息是“歪曲事实的捏造”，这是由于埃及的敌人想要“促使美国舆论责难埃及”。
