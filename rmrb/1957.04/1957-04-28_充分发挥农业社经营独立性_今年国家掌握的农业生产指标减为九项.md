Xinhua News Agency, April 27th: This reporter learned from the Ministry of Agriculture that the agricultural production targets controlled by the state this year have been reduced from twenty-five to nine. This is a preliminary measure taken to enable agricultural cooperatives to fully exert their independence in business management under the guidance of the state plan.

The nine targets are grain, cotton, soybeans, peanuts, rapeseed, tobacco, jute, ramie, and live pigs. Other indicators, such as the classification indicators of various grains, the indicators of sugar crops and tea, and the indicators of various livestock other than live pigs, are all formulated by the agricultural cooperatives themselves and reviewed and balanced by provincial or county-level authorities.

Now the county-level governments in each province have greater responsibility and power than before. They can formulate reference targets for the production of several major crops, or control production targets for a certain area of cultivated land. The remaining cultivated land is planned for production by the agricultural cooperatives themselves.

According to staff members of the Ministry of Agriculture, reducing the agricultural production targets controlled by central departments and giving local and agricultural cooperatives maneuvering power can meet the needs of farmers for various minor grains, feed, and edible oil, and at the same time increase farmers' enthusiasm for production.

In the past, in order to meet the needs of national economic construction, the agricultural sector conducted unified planning for the production targets of various crops, and most of them were controlled by the state. Although this approach played a certain role in ensuring the national grain supply and meeting the needs of industrial production, it was impossible for agricultural cooperatives to plan production in accordance with local conditions because the production targets of various crops were controlled too meticulously and strictly, and some places had mechanical distribution in specific implementation. The crops produced were often not suitable for the actual needs of agricultural cooperatives and their members. The nine production targets now controlled by the state are not only formulated by the state from top to bottom, but also take into account the production plans of agricultural cooperatives in various places, and make necessary adjustments according to the actual situation. In this way, not only is the state's demand for major crops such as grain and cotton effectively guaranteed, but it is also suitable for the possible conditions of the agricultural cooperatives themselves. At the same time, it provides good conditions for agricultural cooperatives in various places to develop the operation of other crops in accordance with local conditions, and to better exert the enthusiasm and creativity of the members in production.

    充分发挥农业社经营独立性
    今年国家掌握的农业生产指标减为九项
    新华社27日讯　本社记者从农业部获悉，今年国家掌握的农业生产指标，已由二十五项减到了九项。这是使农业合作社能够在国家计划指导下充分发挥经营管理独立性所采取的初步措施。
    这九项指标是粮食、棉花、大豆、花生、油菜、烟草、黄麻、苎麻和生猪。其它如各种粮食的分类指标，糖料作物和茶的指标，生猪以外的各种牲畜的指标等，一概由农业社自行制定，经省或县级机关审查平衡。
    现在各省的县级政府都比从前有了较大的责任和权力，他们能够制定几种主要作物生产的参考指标，或者控制一定耕地面积的生产指标。其余耕地由农业合作社自行制定生产计划。
    据农业部工作人员谈，减少中央部门控制的农业生产指标，给地方和农业合作社以机动的权力，可以满足农民对各种小杂粮、饲料和食油的需要，同时还可以提高农民的生产积极性。
    过去农业部门为了国家经济建设的需要，对各项农作物的生产指标进行了统一规划，并且大都由国家控制。这种做法在保证对全国的粮食供应和满足工业生产需要方面虽然起了一定作用，但是由于对各种农作物的生产指标掌握得过细过严，在具体执行中某些地方有机械分配现象，因此使农业合作社不可能因地制宜的来规划生产，所生产的作物往往不适合农业合作社和社员的实际需要。现在国家掌握的九项生产指标，除有国家自上而下制定外，同时还考虑到各地农业合作社的生产计划，并且根据实际情况进行必要的调整。这样，不仅切实地保证了国家对粮、棉等主要农作物的需求，又适合于农业合作社本身的可能条件。同时，对各地农业合作社因地制宜地开展其他农作物的经营，更好地发挥社员生产积极性和创造性，提供了良好的条件。
