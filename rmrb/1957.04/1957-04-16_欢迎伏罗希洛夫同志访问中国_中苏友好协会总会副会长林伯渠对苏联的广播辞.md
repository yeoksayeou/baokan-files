Dear comrades and friends in Moscow and throughout the Soviet Union:

Comrade K.Y. Voroshilov, the head of the great Soviet ally of the Chinese people, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, is coming to our country on the 15th for a friendly visit at the invitation of our Chairman Mao Zedong. As this long-awaited and wonderful day approaches, I would like to express, on behalf of all members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association and the people of the whole country, our most sincere and warm welcome and our highest respect.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government, the great Soviet people have already achieved brilliant successes in the cause of building a communist society, made great contributions to the maintenance of world peace, and provided tremendous, selfless, and comprehensive assistance to the socialist construction of our country and all brother countries. The Chinese people deeply realize that the great Soviet Union is the center of unity for all socialist countries, and that the friendly unity between China and the Soviet Union is an extremely important part of the great unity of socialist countries. To continue to strengthen Sino-Soviet friendship and consolidate the unity of the socialist camp is the highest international obligation of our people.

Comrade Voroshilov is an outstanding activist of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet state. His brilliant experience full of struggle and dedication to the revolution has long been admired and loved by the people of the Soviet Union, the people of China, and all progressive people in the world. This time, he has traveled a long distance to visit our country, working hard to further strengthen Sino-Soviet friendship, which makes us feel supremely honored and encouraged. We believe that Comrade Voroshilov's visit will surely lead to further development of the profound friendship between our two peoples. I sincerely wish Comrade Voroshilov a smooth and successful visit to various parts of our country!

Let us shout:

Long live the eternal and unbreakable fraternal friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union!
Long live the unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union!
Long live world peace!
