    Defying Interference from American “Experts,”
    Thai Government Decides to Exploit Oil
    (Reported by this newspaper) Bangkok newspapers report that American attempts to obstruct the Thai government's development of its own oil resources have aroused great dissatisfaction among Thai people and public opinion.
    According to the Thai government's plan, it is prepared to build an oil refinery in Fang County, Chiang Mai Province, within two years and exploit the oil in this area to meet domestic needs and save foreign exchange. However, the American "advisor" to the Thai Ministry of Finance attempted to persuade the Thai government to abandon this plan, citing "too much investment and no profit." According to reports in Bangkok's "Liberty Communications" and "Central Plains Daily" newspapers, this American interference has caused a great reaction in Thailand. Nai Sarit, the Thai Minister of Defense responsible for this exploitation plan, said: "This plan has been constantly obstructed by foreigners," and believes that "the suggestions of some foreigners are groundless." Narong Salitathaveepak, Director of the Fuel Bureau of the Thai Ministry of Defense, told the press on April 1: "The American advisor's advice is for the benefit of his country, attempting to prevent the realization of our plan; in order to protect our country, we must strive to realize the plan." A Thai expert accused the American attempt of being "to allow foreign companies to continue to monopolize Thailand's oil trade."
      "Liberty Communications" published an editorial on the 1st criticizing the United States for extracting huge profits from Thailand by monopolizing Thailand's oil trade, making Thailand an economic slave that can never stand up. The newspaper advocated that Thailand take an independent and autonomous path, free itself from shackles, and eliminate any interference in Thailand's internal affairs.
    According to a report in the "Siamese People's Daily," the Thai Council of Ministers decided on the 10th to ignore the objections of American "experts" and authorize the Ministry of Defense to continue with the plan to exploit oil in Fang County.

### 不理睬美国“专家”的干涉  泰国政府决定开采石油

    不理睬美国“专家”的干涉
    泰国政府决定开采石油
    本报讯　据曼谷报纸报道：美国企图阻挠泰国政府开发本国石油资源的活动，引起了泰国人士和舆论的极大不满。
    按照泰国政府计划，准备在两年内在清迈府芳县建成一座炼油厂，并开采这个地区的石油，以供应国内需要和节省外汇。但是，泰国财政部的美国“顾问”，却以“投资太大，不能获利”为理由，企图使泰国政府放弃这项计划。据曼谷“自由通讯报”和“中原报”报道：美国这一干涉活动，在泰国引起很大反响。负责这项开采计划的泰国国防部长乃沙立说：“这个计划一直受到外国的从中阻挠”，并认为：“某些外国人士的建议是毫无理由的”。泰国国防部燃料局长纳隆·萨利塔维帕克4月1日对报界说：“美国顾问的建议，是为了他的国家利益，企图阻止我们计划的实现；为了爱护我们的国家，必须努力实现计划”。一位泰国专家指责美国这种企图是“为了使外国公司继续垄断泰国石油贸易”。
      “自由通讯报”1日为此发表社论，指责美国借垄断泰国石油贸易，榨取了泰国的巨额利润，使泰国成为永远无法抬头的经济奴隶。这家报纸主张泰国采取独立自主的路线，摆脱束缚和排除任何对泰国内政的干涉。
    据“暹罗群众报”报道，泰国国务会议10日决定不理睬美国“专家”的反对，而授权国防部继续从事开采芳县石油的计划。
