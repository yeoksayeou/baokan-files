Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 23rd. To meet the people's needs for cultural and artistic life, the Soviet Union will film many new science popularization films and art films reflecting the lives of various ethnic groups this year.

　　Among the more than two hundred and fifty science popularization films to be produced this year, new achievements in Soviet science and technology in recent years, as well as some aspects of cultural life, will be vividly reflected. These include short films and large-scale color films. A recently completed documentary introducing a new method of heart surgery has aroused great interest. This film vividly records the complex surgery to treat a serious heart disease—pulmonary valve stenosis. Doctors believe this is the best visual teaching material. Another popular science film "To the Planets" is about to be completed in Leningrad. This film will introduce the principles of rockets and the research achievements of Soviet scientists in rocket technology. At the Sverdlovsk Film Studio in the Urals, the film "The Story of Rocks and Minerals" is being produced. This film popularizes the principles of mineralogy, the rich mineral resources of the Soviet Union, and methods for further utilizing them.

　　In order to meet the needs of rapidly developing agriculture, the Soviet Union will produce fifty science popularization films related to agriculture this year.

　　Among the films produced in the Soviet Union, the number of films reflecting the lives of people of all ethnic groups will greatly increase this year. Some republic film studios that were previously unable to produce feature films, such as the film studios in the Kirghiz and Estonian Republics, have now begun to produce feature films. Many of the film scripts are written by writers of these ethnic groups.

　　The Frunze Film Studio in Kirghizia is currently producing Kirghizia's first feature film, "Recognition." This film, which depicts the lives of Kirghiz farmers, is performed by theater actors and amateur art troupe actors, many of whom are acting in a movie for the first time.

　　The Tashkent Film Studio will soon film "Permit Issued by Lenin." This is a feature film depicting the story of the establishment of the Central Asian University in Tashkent on Lenin's proposal.

    满足人民文艺生活的需求
    苏联今年拍摄大量新影片
    新华社莫斯科23日电　苏联今年将拍摄许多科学普及影片和反映各族人民生活的艺术影片。

    为了适应迅速发展的农业的需要，苏联今年将摄制五十部有关农业的科学普及影片。
    苏联摄制的影片中，反映各民族人民生活的影片今年将大大增加。以前不能拍摄艺术片的一些共和国电影制片厂，例如吉尔吉斯、爱沙尼亚共和国的电影制片厂等现在都开始摄制艺术片了。有不少电影脚本就是由本民族的作家创作的。
    吉尔吉斯的伏龙芝电影制片厂现在正在摄制吉尔吉斯第一部故事片“承认”。这部描写吉尔吉斯农民生活的影片由话剧演员和业余艺术团体的演员演出，其中有许多人还是第一次作电影演员。
    塔什干电影制片厂即将拍摄“列宁发的许可证”。这是一部描写根据列宁的提议，在塔什干建立中亚细亚大学的故事片。
