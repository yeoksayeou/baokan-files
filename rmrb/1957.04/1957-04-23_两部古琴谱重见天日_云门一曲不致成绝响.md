　　Two Ancient Qin Scores Resurface, Cloud Gate Melody Averted from Extinction

　　(Our dispatch) The Central Conservatory of Music's Institute of民族音乐学 (National Musicology) recently discovered two important and rare ancient qin scores: "Little Orchid Qin Score" and "Introduction to Qin Studies."

　　The manuscript "Little Orchid Qin Score" was handwritten by Ye Bu, a qin player from Wuhu, during the Qianlong period. The original score contains thirteen pieces, with annotations beside the pieces detailing the application of finger techniques and expressions of emotional understanding. Among them, the "Cloud Gate" melody is not found in any other qin score. According to the "Fuyang County Gazetteer," the thirteen pieces, including "Cloud Gate," were originally pieces performed in the inner court during the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty (1573-1619). Later, the qin player Jia Chaoyun transmitted them to Cao Yongding and Liu Tiren. Liu passed them on to Zhang Kaiji, and after Zhang's death, the pieces were lost. Zhou Qingyun's "Qin Score Preserved Catalogue" categorized "Cloud Gate" as "lyrics and score lost" based on this record. The discovery of the "Little Orchid Qin Score" not only demonstrates that "Cloud Gate" was not lost but also allows tracing back to the playing method of the mid-Ming Dynasty. The ancient qin player Wang Mengshu is currently working on excavating and playing the "Cloud Gate" melody.

　　"Introduction to Qin Studies" consists of ten volumes, compiled by the qin player Chen Liangshi during the Guangxu period. In 1914, when Zhou Qingyun compiled the "Catalogue of Qin Books Preserved," he considered this book to be a monumental work among modern qin books, worthy of early publication. For more than forty years, it had not been published, and its whereabouts were unknown until recently when the original manuscript was found in Suzhou. Theoretical texts occupy four volumes, including a discussion of ancient qin composition methods, which is extremely valuable material. The music scores occupy eight volumes, containing a total of fifty pieces, including five original compositions by Chen Liangshi and several scores transmitted by He Guisheng and Zhu Tingtong. He and Zhu were both famous qin players in the late Qing Dynasty, but no qin scores of theirs have been passed down. The discovery of "Introduction to Qin Studies" is equivalent to discovering the scores of the He and Zhu families.

### 两部古琴谱重见天日  云门一曲不致成绝响

    两部古琴谱重见天日  云门一曲不致成绝响
    本报讯　中央音乐学院民族音乐研究所最近发现两部重要而罕见的古琴谱：“小兰琴谱”和“琴学初津”。
    稿本“小兰琴谱”乾隆时芜湖琴家叶布手抄。原谱十三曲，曲旁的注解，写明指法的运用及表达感情的体会。其中的“云门”一曲为其他任何琴谱所没有的。据“阜阳县志”称云门等十三曲，原为明万历时（1573—1619）供奉内廷之曲，后经琴家贾巢云传给曹永鼎及刘体仁。刘传张开基，张死后，各曲便失传。周庆云琴操存目根据这段记载将“云门”编入“词谱俱逸”一类之内。现在“小兰琴谱”的发现，不仅说明“云门”并未失传，并可上溯到明代中叶的弹法。古琴家汪孟舒正在进行对云门的发掘弹奏工作。
    “琴学初津”十卷，光绪间琴家陈良士编著。1914年周庆云编琴书存目时便认为此书是近代琴书中的巨帙，应该早日付印。四十多年来，未能出版，书的下落也不明，一直到最近才从苏州将原稿本找到。十卷之中，理论文字占四卷，其中讲到古琴作曲法，是非常可贵的材料。曲谱八卷，共五十曲，包括陈良士的自制曲五首和何桂笙，祝听桐的传谱若干首。何、祝两人都是清末的名琴家，但都没有琴谱传下来。“琴学初津”的发现也等于发现了何、祝两家的谱本。
