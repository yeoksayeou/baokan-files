Intensify Exploration of the "Black Belt"

　　Coal exploration personnel have recently left Xi'an one after another to investigate coal sources in the Weibei Coalfield. In this hilly area, known as the "Shaanxi Black Belt," which is more than 330 kilometers long, about three-quarters of the area will be surveyed this year.

　　Starting this year, the Northwest Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau will accelerate the exploration of this coalfield, striving to complete the exploration of the known geological conditions of this large coalfield several years ahead of schedule.

　　Currently, in the central area of the coalfield—the Tongchuan mining area—drilling rigs on the mountaintops and in the mountain gullies are drilling into coal seams day and night, and electric logging vehicles are measuring the exact location of the coal seams in the completed boreholes.

    加紧探察“黑腰带”
    煤炭勘探人员最近已经陆续离开西安，到渭北煤田去调查煤源。在这条长三百三十多公里、被称为“陕西黑腰带”的丘陵地带，今年约有四分之三的地区要进行勘测活动。
    从今年起，西北煤田地质勘探局要加快这个煤田的勘查速度，争取把这个大煤田的已知地质情况提前几年勘查完毕。
    现在，在煤田的中心地区——铜川矿区，山顶上和山沟里的钻机在日夜钻探煤层，已完工的钻孔，电测车正在测量煤层准确位置。
