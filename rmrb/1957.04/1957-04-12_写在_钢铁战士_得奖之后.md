    Thoughts After "Steel Fighter" Wins Award
    Cheng Yin
    "Steel Fighter" has won the honorary title of Excellent Film. As the screenwriter and director of this film, I am very excited. At the same time, I am deeply aware that this honor is the result of the joint efforts of all the collaborators of the film and should be shared by our entire creative collective.
    Looking back on the creative process of this film, I have many feelings. "Steel Fighter" was the second film I made after joining the film industry. I left the army, where I had served for a long time, and transferred to film work in 1948. During the long years of war, I saw many comrades sacrifice their precious lives for the revolution, or suffer serious hardships. Their heroic deeds inspired and moved me. Therefore, after the transfer, I had a strong desire to portray their heroic images on the screen. At the end of 1948, when I was filming "Returning to Our Own Ranks," I was very fortunate to see the performance of the stage play "Steel Bones and Iron Muscles" by Comrades Su Li, Wu Zhaodi, and Wu Yin. The characters on the stage and the life I was familiar with merged together at once. In 1949, I participated in the founding ceremony in Beijing. When the five-star red flag rose in front of Tiananmen Square, a strong emotion impacted me, making my eyes sore and tears uncontrollably welling up. "We finally won! For today's victory, how many comrades shed blood and how many comrades suffered hardships!" The creative impulse could no longer let me rest, so I sat down and started to adapt "Steel Bones and Iron Muscles" into a film. During the adaptation, these characters came alive in front of me. By the time of filming, the actors, cinematographers, and I all fell in love with these heroic characters. We finished filming this film with great enthusiasm.
    After the film was completed, we were not very satisfied, especially now, there are still very naive aspects in the expression methods and the handling of the enemy; even the portrayal of several heroic characters is not rich and colorful enough, nor deep enough. Some people say: If we were to make this film now, it would be handled better. I have thought about this too, but I don't know if we would still have the same strong creative impulse we had at that time. Although I have made several films since then, my feelings for the life reflected in the films, as well as for the stories and characters in the films, have not been as strong. I have completed the creation of these films more with so-called professional skills, which cannot but greatly limit the results of the filming.
    In the new life, there are many touching subjects, and more new heroic figures have emerged. Among them, there have been many topics that have attracted me, but I have not been able to deeply understand them, become familiar with them, and make them a source of creation. Therefore, when "Steel Fighter" is rewarded, I cannot help but feel that if the creators themselves are not familiar with and love life, and thus generate a strong creative desire, it is impossible to create any good works. This point of understanding is just extremely common sense for mature writers, but for me, it is extremely beneficial experience.

    写在“钢铁战士”得奖之后
    成荫
    “钢铁战士”获得了优秀影片的荣誉称号，作为这一影片的编剧和导演，我感到非常兴奋，同时也深知这个荣誉是我们整个影片的合作者共同努力所得到的，应该为我们整个创作集体所共有。
    回想这部影片的创作过程，我产生很多感触。“钢铁战士”是我参加电影工作以后拍摄的第二部影片。我是在1948年离开长期服务的部队，转业到电影工作岗位上来的。在长期的战争生活中，我看到很多战友为了革命付出了宝贵的生命，或者遭到严重的磨难，他们的英雄事迹鼓舞着我，使我激动，因此转业以后，我就产生了一个强烈的愿望：在银幕上把他们的英雄形象表现出来。1948年末在我拍摄“回到自己队伍来”的时候，我非常幸运地看到了苏里、武兆堤、吴茵三位同志创作的舞台剧“钢骨铁筋”的演出，舞台上的那些人物和我所熟悉的生活一下子就融化在一起了。1949年我在北京参加了开国大典，当五星红旗在天安门前上升的时候，一种强烈地感情冲击着我，使我眼睛发酸，泪水不能抑制的涌了出来，“我们终于胜利了！为了今天的胜利，多少同志流了血，多少同志受了磨难啊！”创作的冲动再也使我不能安宁，于是我坐下来着手将“钢骨铁筋”改编成电影。在改编的时候，这些人物在我面前活了起来，到拍摄的时候，我和演员、摄影师等都爱上了这些英雄人物了。我们满怀热情地拍完了这部影片。
    影片完成以后，我们并不是很满意的，特别是现在来看，在表现方法上和对敌人的处理上，都还有着很幼稚的地方；就是对几个英雄人物的塑造，也还嫌不够丰富多采和不够深化。有人说：假使现在来拍这部影片，会处理的更好一些，我也这样想过，可是我不知道还会不会有当时所曾有过的那种强烈的创作冲动。以后我虽然也拍过几部影片，但是我对影片所反映的生活，以及对影片的故事和人物的感情不是那么强烈的，更多的是以所谓职业的技巧来完成这些影片的创作，这就不能不大大地限制了拍摄的结果。
    新的生活中，有不少动人的题材，也涌现出更多新的英雄人物，其中也曾有不少吸引过我的题目，可是我没有能够深入地去了解它们，熟悉它们，使之成为创作的源泉。因此当“钢铁战士”得到奖励的时候，我不能不产生这样的感想，就是：创作者本身若不熟知和热爱生活，从而产生强烈的创作欲望，是不可能创作出什么好的作品来的。这一点体会，对成熟的作家来说，只不过是极为普通的常识，可是对我来说，却是极为有益的经验。
