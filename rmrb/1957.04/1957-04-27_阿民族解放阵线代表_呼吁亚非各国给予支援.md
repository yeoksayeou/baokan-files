    Representatives of the Algerian National Liberation Front
    Call on Asian and African Countries for Support
    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 26th - Antara News Agency reported that, to commemorate the second anniversary of the Asian-African Conference, Lakdar Brahimi, the representative of the Algerian National Liberation Front in Indonesia, issued a statement on the 24th calling on Asian and African countries to assist the Algerian people's struggle for independence in various ways.
    The statement said that although two years have passed since the Bandung Conference, the situation of the Algerian people is now more tragic than in the past; all the Algerian people have become the target of slaughter by 500,000 French troops.
    The statement said that this situation in Algeria is a threat to world peace, and therefore hopes that Asian and African countries will sympathize with and assist the Algerian independence struggle. (Attached picture)
