    Britain Decides to End “Embargo” on Democratic Korea

    (Reported by our newspaper) A spokesman for the British Board of Trade confirmed on April 8 that the comprehensive trade "embargo" order issued by the British government in 1950 against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was terminated on March 4.

    According to a British Foreign Office spokesman on April 9, future trade with North Korea "will be subject to the same strict controls as those applied to China. These controls prevent the export of any materials of strategic significance."

    The spokesman said that the sharp reactions of South Korean and American people to the British decision were "unjustified."

    英国决定结束对民主朝鲜的“禁运”
    本报讯　英国贸易部发言人4月8日证实，英国政府1950年颁布的对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的全面贸易“禁运”令已在3月4日结束。
    据英国外交部发言人4月9日说，今后对北朝鲜贸易“要实行像对中国实行的那种严格的管制。这种管制防止出口任何具有战略意义的物资”。
    这个发言人说，南朝鲜和美国人士对英国决定的尖锐反应是“毫无道理的”。
