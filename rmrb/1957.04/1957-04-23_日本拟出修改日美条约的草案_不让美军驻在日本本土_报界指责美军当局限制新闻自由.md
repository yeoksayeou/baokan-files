Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 22nd: According to a report in yesterday's "Yomiuri Shimbun," the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has drafted a revised version of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty." According to this draft, U.S. troops would not be stationed on the Japanese mainland but only on outlying islands such as Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands.

This influential newspaper revealed that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' draft was prepared according to the instructions of Japanese Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Nobusuke Kishi. Kishi will take this draft with him when he visits the United States this year to discuss the revision of the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" with U.S. government leaders.

It is revealed that, according to the provisions of this draft, U.S. troops can only be deployed to the Japanese mainland if Japan is subjected to "foreign aggression" and at the formal request of the Japanese government; at the same time, U.S. troops must not be used to suppress domestic "disturbances and riots" in Japan.

In this draft, the Japanese government also requests that the effective period of the "Security Treaty" be clearly stipulated, and that the effective period should not be set at ninety-nine years, which is virtually permanent. The Japanese government also maintains that the treaty will automatically expire one year after either party to the treaty requests its abolition. The current Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" does not stipulate an effective period.

The Japanese draft also stipulates that the U.S. military must obtain the approval of the Japanese government to transport missiles into Japan.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 22nd: The 1957 annual report of the Japan Newspaper Publishers and Editors Association criticized the past U.S. occupation authorities' policy of restricting Japanese press freedom, saying that the U.S. occupation period was a "terrifying era of censorship and suspension" for Japanese newspapers.

The article said, "Some Japanese newspapers were ordered to suspend publication or were threatened with suspension for criticizing certain aspects of the occupation policy or for publishing news about the rape of Japanese women by occupation personnel." The article also said that the U.S. occupation period's censorship system replaced the wartime Japanese government's censorship system.

    日本拟出修改日美条约的草案
    不让美军驻在日本本土
    报界指责美军当局限制新闻自由
    据新华社22日讯　东京消息：“读卖新闻”昨天报道，日本外务省已经拟定一项修改日美“安全条约”的草案。根据这项草案，美国军队将不得驻在日本本土，而只能驻在冲绳岛、小笠原群岛等外围岛屿上。
    这家有影响的报纸透露，外务省的这项草案是根据日本首相兼外务相岸信介的指示拟定的。岸信介将在今年访问美国时携带这项草案，同美国政府首脑讨论修改日美“安全条约”问题。
    据透露，根据这项草案的规定，美国军队只有在日本遭受“外来侵略”并且在日本政府的正式要求下才能被调往日本本土；同时，美国军队不得被用来镇压日本国内的“骚乱和暴动”。
    日本政府还在这项草案中，要求明确规定“安全条约”的有效期限，并且要求避免把有效期限规定为实际上具有永久性的九十九年。日本政府同时主张，在缔约的任何一方向对方提出废除“安全条约”的要求的一年以后，这项条约将自动失效。目前的日美“安全条约”没有规定有效期限。
    日本的草案还规定，美国军队要把导弹运进日本必须得到日本政府的批准。
    据新华社22日讯　东京消息：日本报纸主笔与发行人协会的1957年年报批评过去的美国占领当局限制日本新闻自由的政策说，美国占领时期是日本报纸遭受“检查和停刊的恐怖时代”。
    文章说，“有一些日本报纸由于批评占领政策的某些方面或者登载了关于占领人员奸淫日本妇女的消息而奉令停刊或者受到停刊的威胁”。文章还说，美国占领时期的新闻检查代替了战时日本政府的新闻检查制度。
