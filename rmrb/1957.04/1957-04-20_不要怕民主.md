Don't Be Afraid of Democracy
Fú Xiān
The April 16th "People's Daily" on page six published a report from Wuhan Electric, stating: "Cadres in Wuhan City have achieved preliminary results in studying Chairman Mao's speeches," but "some cadres still have ideological problems. Some cadres believe 'the situation is much more complicated than in the past, and it's harder to be a cadre,' while others think 'there is too much democracy among the masses now, and things are difficult to handle,' yearning for certain simple working methods of the past."

This dispatch attributes some cadres' dislike of "too much democracy among the masses" to the problem of "yearning for certain simple working methods of the past," which I find somewhat doubtful. Of course, whether cadres are democratic or not does have some impact on the complexity and simplicity of working methods. However, it is not necessarily the case that democracy leads to complexity and a lack of democracy leads to simplicity. From what I have seen, some cadres who do not dislike too much democracy have very simple working methods, which is to let the masses say what they want and do what they want, allowing things to drift, without research, concentration, or problem-solving. And some cadres who extremely hate democracy, in order to dislike a certain "mass's" "too much democracy," then resort to "leader responsibility, mobilizing the masses, unifying thought," racking their brains. Their working methods are truly extremely complex.

Therefore, I believe that disliking too much democracy is simply disliking too much democracy and should not be confused with working methods.

Today's relatively senior cadres have all suffered from the Kuomintang's lack of democracy and struggled for democracy for many years; they also deeply know the complexity of the Kuomintang's "working methods" of suppressing democracy. Now is the era of socialist democracy, but some senior cadres dislike "too much democracy among the masses." What is the reason for this? Perhaps because he is now a "cadre" and has been liberated from the identity of "masses"; perhaps his past struggle for democracy was only for himself, not for the masses—but I dare not be dogmatic.

But in general, some cadres now really dislike too much democracy and are increasingly afraid of democracy. I think that the fear of the Hundred Flowers Blooming and the fear of the Hundred Schools of Thought Contending, regardless of whether the motives are good or bad, and whether the reasons are skillful or clumsy, are essentially fears of democracy.

Why fear democracy? Some consider themselves to be acting for the Party and the country, fearing that if democracy increases, socialism will be shaken; they see the foundation of the Party and the country as very weak. Others, however, are only for themselves, fearing that if democracy increases, their own airs will be unstable; they secretly have some self-awareness about their own foundation.

The foundation of the Party and the country is not so weak, because that foundation is Marxism, is truth, and is also democracy. How can a democratic Party and country be shaken by democracy! Therefore, comrades who are truly for the Party and the country need not worry about this "杞人" worry at all.

As for personal foundations, of course, it is difficult to say. If this foundation is only composed of dogmatism, sectarianism, bureaucratism..., then it naturally cannot withstand the impact of democracy. But since this is the case, fear is also useless, and the more you fear, the more useless it becomes. It is better to quickly stand on the foundation of democracy together with the "masses." Otherwise, at the beginning, the masses dislike too little democracy, and you dislike too much democracy, but because there is still a little democracy, the contradiction is still non-antagonistic; but if it is not handled properly, the masses' dissatisfaction with you will deepen, and you will be even more afraid, then, as it develops, the contradiction may become antagonistic. Therefore, whether the internal contradictions of the people are handled correctly, whether they will be transformed into antagonistic contradictions, is determined by whether there is democracy or not, not by the simplicity or complexity of working methods.

There are many things in the world that are bound to disappear after their vitality has been exhausted or after their tasks have been completed. In the future, the Communist Party will disappear, the country will disappear, and as for the current democratic system, according to Lenin, it will also disappear in communist society. But that is a distant future matter. At present, and throughout the socialist period, the bourgeois democracy that is only enjoyed by a few rich people has lost its reason for existence, while the democracy enjoyed by the broad masses of working people will not only not disappear but will also have strong vitality and will greatly develop. Now this kind of democracy is not too much, but not enough. It is precisely through the development of this democracy that socialist society can become increasingly perfect and transition to communism.

The "People's Daily," while publishing the above-mentioned Wuhan telegram, also published news about the Shanghai intellectual community also discussing Chairman Mao's speech, with the title "Intense Debate Unfolds in a Democratic Atmosphere"; I think this is a more pertinent way of putting it than the Wuhan telegram.

    不要怕民主
    弗先
    4月16日“人民日报”第六版刊登的武汉电中说：“武汉市干部学习毛主席讲话获得初步成绩”，但“干部中还有一些思想问题。有的干部认为‘情况比过去复杂得多了，干部难当了’，也有的认为‘现在群众民主太多，事情难办’，留恋过去的某些简单的工作方法”。
    这电文把有的干部的嫌“群众民主太多”，也归结为“留恋过去的某些简单的工作方法”的问题，我不免有些怀疑。当然，干部的民主不民主，对工作方法的复杂和简单，不是毫无影响的。但是，不一定民主的就复杂，不民主的就简单。据我所见，有的不嫌民主多的干部，工作方法也很简单，就是让群众说去，干去，放任自流，不研究，不集中，不解决问题。而有的极讨厌民主的干部，为了嫌某一个“群众”的“民主太多”，于是“首长负责，发动群众，统一思想”，费尽心机。他的工作方法，真是复杂极了。
    所以，我以为嫌民主太多就是嫌民主太多，不应与工作方法混为一谈。
    现在的比较高级的干部，都是吃过国民党的不民主的苦头，曾为争取民主而奋斗多年的；他们也深知国民党的压制民主的“工作方法”之复杂。现在是社会主义民主的时代了，而有的高级干部，却嫌“群众民主太多”了，这是什么原因呢？也许，因为他现在已经是“干部”，从“群众”身份中解放出来了；也许，他过去的争民主，仅仅是为了他自己，并非为了群众——但我不敢武断。
    但总而言之，现在有些干部却实在是嫌民主太多，而且愈来愈怕民主。我看，对百花齐放的怕，对百家争鸣的怕，尽管动机有好坏，理由有工拙，实质上都是对民主的怕。
    为什么怕民主呢？有的自以为是为党为国，怕民主多起来，社会主义就会动摇；他看得党、国的基础薄弱得很。也有的，却只是为了自己，怕民主多起来，自己的什么架子摆不稳了；他暗中对于自己的基础，倒是有点自知之明的。
    党、国的基础，并不那么薄弱，因为那基础是马克思主义，是真理，而且也就是民主。民主的党、国，怎么会被民主所动摇呢！所以，真正为党为国的同志，是大可不必担这“杞人”之忧的。
    至于个人的基础，当然很难说。倘若，这基础只是教条主义、宗派主义、官僚主义……的构成，那么，自然经不起民主的冲击的。但既然如此，怕，也不中用，而且愈怕愈不中用，还是自己也赶快和“群众”一道，站到民主的基础上去的好。否则，开始的时候，群众嫌民主少了，你嫌民主多了，但因多少还有一点民主，所以，那矛盾还是非对抗性的；而处理不当，群众对你的不满就要加深，你却更害怕，那么，发展下去矛盾就可能变成对抗性的了。所以，人民内部的矛盾处理得正确不正确，会不会转化为对抗性的矛盾，是决定于民主不民主，而不是决定于工作方法之简单与复杂的。
    世界上有许多东西，在生命力发挥完了以后，或者在任务完成以后，是必然要消亡的。将来，共产党要消亡，国家要消亡，至于现在的民主制，据列宁说，到了共产主义社会，也是要消亡的。但那是遥远的将来的事。在目前，而且在整个社会主义时期，只供少数的富人享受的资产阶级民主，已经失去存在的理由了，而供广大劳动群众享受的民主，却不但不会消亡，而且有着强大的生命力，要大大发展的。现在这种民主不是太多了，而是还不够。正是这种民主的发展，社会主义社会才能日益完美以至过渡到共产主义去。
    “人民日报”上，在发表上述的武汉电的同时，发表了关于上海知识界也在讨论毛主席的讲话的消息，其标题是“在民主的气氛中展开激烈争论”；我以为，这比武汉电的提法来得中肯。
