    According to Vice Chairman Chen Jiageng's Suggestion
    Rubber Industry Department Will Promote the Use of Crêpe Rubber

    (Our newspaper dispatch) On April 18th, the State Economic Commission convened a symposium of relevant departments. Based on the suggestion made by Mr. Chen Jiageng, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, at the Third Plenary Session of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC regarding the adoption of crêpe rubber raw materials in the rubber industry, the meeting specifically studied how to actively and systematically promote the use of crêpe rubber in the rubber industry. The person in charge of the State Economic Commission said at the meeting that the amount of crêpe rubber that the country will import this year will reach approximately 10% of the national rubber usage.

    The symposium believed that China's rubber industry has historically used imported smoked sheets. With the development of the rubber industry, the amount of rubber used has increased year by year. At the same time, imported smoked sheets have been of high quality and expensive, and the amount of foreign exchange occupied has increased day by day. Mr. Chen Jiageng's suggestion is timely and correct. Using crêpe rubber within a certain range can save the country a considerable amount of foreign exchange, so the use of crêpe rubber should be actively promoted in the rubber industry. However, because crêpe rubber has disadvantages such as more impurities and poorer tensile and abrasion resistance than smoked sheets, coupled with the fact that China has less experience in using this type of rubber and some factories are still restricted by equipment, some products with higher quality requirements cannot currently use crêpe rubber. In the future, in addition to further strengthening experimental research to gradually expand the scope of use of crêpe rubber, attention should also be paid to quality inspection during import to avoid importing rubber with excessive impurities.

    The symposium also decided that the State Economic Commission, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, the Ministry of Light Industry and other relevant departments would jointly organize a working group to conduct on-the-spot investigations in relevant factories in Shanghai to examine the trial use of crêpe rubber, in order to further promote its use.

    Prior to this symposium, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, based on Mr. Chen Jiageng's suggestion, conducted experiments on the use of crêpe rubber at the Tianjin Rubber Factory. Xiao Guichang, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Chemical Industry, personally went to the factory to inspect and supervise the work. Currently, in addition to conducting experiments on general products, the relevant factories under the Ministry of Chemical Industry are also conducting experiments on the manufacture of automobile tires. By May of this year, tires made of crêpe rubber will be produced and driving tests will be carried out. The Ministry of Light Industry, the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and the Ministry of Commerce have also held meetings to study this issue.

    In addition to the person in charge of the State Economic Commission, those who participated in the April 18th symposium included the persons in charge of the Third and Fourth Offices of the State Council, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, the Ministry of Light Industry, the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and other relevant departments.

### 根据陈嘉庚副主席的建议  橡胶工业部门将推广使用绉胶

    根据陈嘉庚副主席的建议
    橡胶工业部门将推广使用绉胶
    本报讯　4月18日，国家经济委员会召集各有关部门举行座谈会，根据政协全国委员会副主席陈嘉庚先生在政协第二届全国委员会第三次全体会议上提出的关于橡胶工业中采用绉片橡胶原料的建议，具体研究了如何积极地有计划地在橡胶工业中推广使用绉片橡胶的各项问题。国家经济委员会负责人在会上说，今年国家进口绉片橡胶的数量，将可达全国橡胶使用量的10％左右。
    座谈会认为，我国橡胶工业历年来多采用进口烟胶，随着橡胶工业的发展，用胶量逐年增加，同时历年进口烟胶质高价贵，占用外汇的数额日益增多。陈嘉庚先生提出的建议是适时的，正确的。在一定范围内使用绉片橡胶可以为国家节约不少外汇，因此应该在橡胶工业中积极推广使用绉片橡胶。但是，由于绉片橡胶存在着杂质多，耐拉和耐磨能力比烟胶差等缺点，加以我国使用这种橡胶的经验较少，有些厂还受着设备限制，因此某些质量要求较高的产品目前还不能使用绉片橡胶。今后除了进一步加强试验研究，以便逐步扩大绉片橡胶的使用范围以外，在进口时也应该注意进行质量检查，以免杂质过多的橡胶进口。
    座谈会还确定由国家经济委员会、化学工业部、轻工业部等有关部门联合组织工作组，在最近去上海有关工厂实地调查试用绉片橡胶的情况，以便进一步推广。
    在这次座谈会以前，化学工业部就根据陈嘉庚先生的建议，在天津橡胶厂进行了使用绉片橡胶的试验。化学工业部副部长萧桂昌还亲自到这个厂去检查督促。目前，化学工业部有关厂除进行一般制品的试验以外，还进行了制造汽车外胎的试验。到今年5月份，就可以有用绉片橡胶制造的轮胎出厂，并进行行驶试验。轻工业部、对外贸易部和商业部等，也都先后开会研究了这一问题。
    参加18日座谈会的，除国家经济委员会的负责人以外，还有国务院第三、第四办公室、化学工业部、轻工业部、商业部、对外贸易部等有关部门的负责人。
