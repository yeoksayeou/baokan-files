    Don't Be Afraid of Not Being Democratic
    Fu Xian
    A few days ago, I talked about "Don't be afraid of democracy." Today, I want to talk about not being afraid of not being democratic.
    Reading the symposium on "Letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" in the newspapers, many people talked about having "concerns." Regarding essays, someone in the "People's Daily" mentioned a "new crisis," while someone in Shanghai's "Liberation Daily" also talked about a "crisis." All these reflections essentially illustrate that there are indeed a few people who are afraid of democracy, and consequently, there are many who are afraid of not being democratic. If there were no former, there would naturally be no latter.
    But I believe that even if there are people who are afraid of democracy, the masses should not be afraid of them.
    Historically, the struggle between democracy and non-democracy has a long history. When Confucius talked about his "benevolence," I think he already touched on the periphery of this problem. Commentators say that the character "benevolence" means "interacting with people" and "two people make benevolence." When class contradictions exist in society, the question of how to handle the conflict of class interests arises. The solution is that even under the autocratic system of the monarch, the interests of the people must be taken care of to some extent, and the people must be given some opportunities to speak. This is somewhat close to the meaning of democracy. Otherwise, if there is only rampant extortion and oppressive dictatorship, the people will surely revolt. Therefore, in a society with class antagonism, "benevolence" is a means used by the ruling class to reconcile class contradictions. In our current society, since political power belongs to all the people and there is no fundamental conflict of interest between classes, but non-antagonistic contradictions still exist, then democracy becomes a means to correctly resolve internal contradictions among the people and develop the material and cultural lives of the people. Therefore, today's democracy has become a new meaning of great benevolence.
    In this sense, we should have the attitude of "the benevolent are free from worry" and "not yielding in the face of benevolence." In the past, the ruling class did not give us democracy, and we struggled with the spirit of "sacrificing oneself to achieve benevolence." Moreover, it is not that the entire class, the entire party, or the entire regime does not allow us to enjoy democracy, but only a few bureaucrats do not allow it, so what are we afraid of!
    But since there are still bureaucrats, we cannot wait for them to automatically let go before we dare to fully enjoy democracy. One of our expressions of daring to fully enjoy democracy now is to fight against bureaucracy; without struggle, bureaucracy may not be willing to disappear on its own.
    Why are people afraid of bureaucracy? People are most afraid of death, but today's bureaucrats do not have so much power that they can put people to death. Confucius said: "The people's dependence on benevolence is greater than on water and fire. I have seen people die by stepping into water and fire, but I have never seen anyone die by stepping into benevolence." In today's world, ultimately, I am afraid that only extreme anti-democracy reactionaries will die from democracy. Those who adhere to democracy will never die by embracing it, and even those bureaucrats who are only a little afraid of democracy but basically do not oppose it will not.
    Today's democracy is led by Marxism. Democracy led by Marxism is also not yielding in the face of benevolence, because only its leadership can realize the true democracy enjoyed by the broad working people. Marxists are modest on other issues; they never compete with the people for benefits and practice self-sacrifice. But on the issues of realizing socialism, realizing democracy, and realizing the truth, they are not modest. This is why Marxists are Marxists.
    However, Marxists also have a modest aspect in this "not yielding in the face of benevolence," which is that they do not think that they can necessarily achieve "not violating benevolence" or not violating democracy. Therefore, they only do not yield when they are truly convinced that they are in line with the truth, and when they discover their own mistakes, they resolutely give way to the truth.
    Moreover, even if they originally grasped a little truth, they also give way when they see that the truth of others is greater than their own. Lu Xun once taught people to "give off a bit of light if you have a bit of heat," that even firefly light has a role. But he also said:
    "If there is no torch afterward: then I am the only light. If there is a torch, if the sun comes out, we will naturally disappear wholeheartedly, not only without any resentment, but also praising and praising this torch or the sun; because it illuminates mankind, including me." The more society develops, the brighter the truth becomes, and the torches and the sun become more and more brilliant. Therefore, we always have a modest heart while not yielding in the face of benevolence; at the same time, we also think that the torch or the sun does not exclude the existence of firefly light, and in fact, we will not disappear.
    Not afraid of darkness, and not afraid of the sun, then what else is there to be afraid of in the world!

### 不要怕不民主

    不要怕不民主
    弗先
    前几天谈过“不要怕民主”，今天想谈谈不要怕不民主。
    看报纸上关于百花齐放和百家争鸣的笔谈，许多人谈到有“顾虑”；关于小品文，“人民日报”上有人提到“新危机”，同时上海的“解放日报”上也有人谈到“危机”。这一切的反映，实质上是说明：现在确实有少数怕民主的人存在，因而另一方面，就有很多怕不民主的人存在。倘没有前者，自然不会有后者了。
    但我以为，即使有怕民主的人存在，人民大众也不要怕他们。
    历史上，民主与不民主的斗争，由来已久矣。孔子讲他的“仁”学的时候，我看已经碰着这个问题的外围。训诂家说仁字是“相人偶”，“二人为仁”；社会上存在着阶级矛盾的时候，就发生对阶级利益的冲突如何处理的问题。解决之法，就是在君主专制的制度下，也得多少给人民的利益一些照顾，给人民的说话一些机会，这也就有些儿近乎民主的意思在里头。否则，一味横征暴敛，专制高压，人民一定就起来造反。所以在阶级对抗的社会中，“仁”是统治阶级用来调和阶级矛盾的手段。而在我们现在的社会中，政权既已归于全体人民，阶级之间，既已没有根本利益的冲突，但非对抗性的矛盾却还存在，那么，民主就成为正确解决人民内部矛盾，发展人民物质生活和文化生活的手段，所以，今天的民主，就成了新的意义上的大仁。
    在这个意义上，我们就应该有“仁人不忧”，“当仁不让”的态度。过去的统治阶级不给我们民主，我们曾经以“杀身成仁”的精神斗争过。何况，现在并不是整个阶级、整个政党、整个政权不让我们享受民主，只是少数官僚主义者不让，那么，我们有什么怕的！
    但官僚主义者既然还有，那么，我们不能等到他们自动放手，才敢充分享受民主。我们现在敢于充分享受民主的表现之一，就是同官僚主义作斗争；不经过斗争，官僚主义恐怕是不肯自行消亡的。
    为什么怕官僚主义？人们最怕的是死，但现在的官僚主义者并没有那么大的权力，能致人民于死地。孔子说过：“民之于仁也，甚于水火。水火，吾见蹈而死者矣，未见蹈仁而死者也。”在今天，归根到底，恐怕只有极端反对民主的反动派才会死于民主，坚持民主的人是决不会蹈民主而死的，就是那只是多多少少有点怕民主而基本上不反对民主的官僚主义者，也不会。
    现在的民主，是由马克思主义领导的。马克思主义领导的民主，也是当仁不让，因为只有它的领导，才能实现真正的供广大劳动人民享受的民主。马克思主义者，在别的问题上，都是谦让的，他们决不与人民争利，而且实行自我牺牲。但在实现社会主义，实现民主，实现真理的问题上，是不谦让的。这就是马克思主义者之所以为马克思主义者。
    但是，马克思主义者在这“当仁不让”中又有谦让之处，就是，他们并不以为自己一定能够做到“不违仁”，不违民主。所以，他们只在确实认为自己符合真理的地方，才不让，而当发觉了自己的错误的时候，却又坚决向真理退让。
    而且，即使自己原来掌握了一点真理，而当看到别人的真理比自己更大的时候，他也退让。鲁迅曾经教人“有一分热，发一分光”，就是萤光也有作用，但是，他又说：
    “此后如竟没有炬火：我便是唯一的光。倘若有了炬火，出了太阳，我们自然心悦诚服的消失，不但毫无不平，而且还要随喜赞美这炬火或太阳；因为他照了人类，连我都在内。”社会愈发展，真理愈光大，炬火和太阳总是愈来愈辉煌的，所以，我们在当仁不让之中又随时存谦让心；同时，还想到，炬火或太阳，并不排斥萤光的存在，实际上我们并不会消失。
    不怕黑暗，也不怕太阳，那么，世上还有什么可怕的！
