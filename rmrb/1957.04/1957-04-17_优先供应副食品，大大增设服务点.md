    Prioritize the Supply of Non-staple Foods, Greatly Increase Service Outlets
    The inspiring Yellow River Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Project has officially commenced, and the people of the whole country are encouraged by this huge construction project. In order to make the people building Sanmenxia work and live happily, the urban service departments are preparing to strengthen the supply of non-staple foods in the work area and greatly increase service outlets to ensure that the people on the construction site have their needs met in this regard.
    Even during the construction preparation stage, the Sanmenxia work area began to establish non-staple food supply agencies and service industries such as barbershops and restaurants. In addition to supplying locally produced vegetables, the vegetable and grocery stores also transported a variety of fine vegetables from other provinces to meet the needs of the construction site staff. The meat supply here is ample, and now each person can eat an average of two jin of pork per month, which is higher than the consumption level in large cities. Last year, Sanmenxia had eleven restaurants, and this year it plans to build three more large canteens, equipped with 120 waiters and waitresses, and plans to draw some highly skilled chefs from Shanghai, Tianjin and other places, so that the construction site staff can eat a variety of dishes with different flavors.
    Service industries are also preparing to increase substantially. There are currently four barbershops, and it is planned to increase to ten this year. The number of barbers will increase from the original 42 to 186. There is currently one bathhouse, and it is planned to build two more. Other facilities such as hotels, photography studios, and laundries will also be greatly increased this year to meet the needs of the growing number of people on the construction site as much as possible.

    优先供应副食品，大大增设服务点
    振奋人心的黄河三门峡水利枢纽工程正式开工了，全国人民都为这个巨大的建设工程而鼓舞。为了使建设三门峡的人们愉快的工作和生活，城市服务部门准备加强工区副食品的供应工作，大量增设服务性的网点，保证工地上的人们对这方面的需要。
    还在施工的准备阶段，三门峡工区就开始分别设立了副食品供应机构和理发、饭馆等服务性行业。蔬菜杂货供应店除供应当地生产的蔬菜以外，还从别的省运来多种细菜满足了工地职工的需要。这里的肉食供应是宽裕的，现在每人每月平均可吃到二斤猪肉，比大城市的消费水平还高。去年三门峡有十一个饭馆，今年计划再建立三个大食堂，配备招待员一百二十人，准备从上海、天津等地抽调一些技术高超的厨师，使工地职工吃到多种多样口味的饭菜。
    服务性行业也准备大量增设。理发店现有四个，今年计划增加到十个，理发师将由原来的四十二名增加到一百八十六名；浴池现有一处，计划再建二处，其余如旅店、照像、洗染店等，今年都增设很多，尽量满足工地上日益增多的人们的需要。　　　（城市服务部）
