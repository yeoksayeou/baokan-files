    Ordinary Steel Can Be Used to Make Ship Anchor Chains
    (Our report) The Shanghai Zhonghua Shipyard uses ordinary steel instead of high-quality steel to manufacture ship anchor chains, without affecting the effectiveness of use and reducing costs.
    This year, due to the national output of high-quality steel not being able to meet production needs, the Shanghai Zhonghua Shipyard manufactured anchor chains using both domestically produced ordinary steel and high-quality carbon structural steel. After completion, physical performance and chemical composition tests proved that the tensile strength of anchor chains made of ordinary steel even exceeded that of anchor chains made of high-quality steel. In terms of manufacturing cost, high-quality steel costs 800 yuan per ton, while ordinary steel costs 450 yuan per ton, a difference of 350 yuan per ton. If all the shipbuilding and repair yards under the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry's Shipbuilding Industry Administration Bureau use ordinary steel to manufacture the planned 1,800 tons of anchor chains this year, the country can save 630,000 yuan for the whole year.

    普通钢可以做船舶锚链
    本报讯　上海中华造船厂用普通钢代替优质钢制造船舶锚链，不影响使用效能，而且降低了成本。
    今年，由于国家优质钢产量不能满足生产需要，上海中华造船厂曾以国产普通钢和优质炭素结构钢同时分别制造锚链。制成后，经作物理性能和化学成分试验，证明用普通钢制造的锚链抗拉强度还超过优质钢制造的锚链。在制造成本上，优质钢每吨八百元，普通钢每吨四百五十元，每吨相差三百五十元。如果第一机械工业部船舶制造工业管理局所属各修造船厂，今年计划生产的一千八百吨锚链都采用普通钢制造，全年就可以给国家节约六十三万元。　（苏曾诒）
