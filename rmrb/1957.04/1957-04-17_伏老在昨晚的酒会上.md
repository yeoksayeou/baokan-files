    △ Chairman Voroshilov wore a light blue suit yesterday, with a silver-based, blue-dotted tie. Bathed in the bright mercury lights, he looked radiant and energetic. Wherever he went, the atmosphere became more lively, and he became the center of attention. His tall, robust figure, as well as his approachable and sincere demeanor, made a deep impression.
    △ Chairman Voroshilov came to the table of the generals, where General Yang Chengwu, Lieutenant General Xiao Xiangrong, and many other generals were seated. Premier Zhou Enlai introduced the distinguished guest. Upon seeing his Chinese comrades-in-arms, Voroshilov warmly shook hands with each of them. He then said, "I love generals, but I oppose war!" This Soviet Union's first marshal, a veteran of many battles and a figure of great renown, profoundly expressed his love for peace.
    △ At the table of people from the literary and art circles were many of our country's famous writers and artists. Premier Zhou Enlai introduced Mei Lanfang and Cheng Yanqiu to the distinguished guest. Chairman Voroshilov, upon seeing China's most famous Peking opera actors, said he would like to see them perform. The Premier then replied that they would perform the day after tomorrow. It turned out that Mr. Mei Lanfang was scheduled to perform at a welcoming gala on April 18th.
    △ Many Soviet experts who are helping us with construction in China and Soviet students studying in Beijing also attended the reception. Chairman Voroshilov instructed the Soviet experts, saying: You are working very well in China, just like you are in your own country. I hope you will do more work to promote friendship between China and the Soviet Union. He also stroked the faces of the Soviet students like a loving father, telling them to study Chinese well and become sinologists in the future.
    △ The distinguished guests were also introduced to the members of the Japanese Socialist Party Goodwill Mission to China, who are currently visiting Beijing. Here, Voroshilov sincerely expressed friendly wishes to the Japanese friends. He said that Japan, the Soviet Union, and China are close neighbors and should engage in friendly cooperation. If everyone has this desire, this goal can be achieved. The Japanese guests replied that this was well said, and we should all make such efforts. Voroshilov then added: Not only say so verbally, but also strive to actually become true brothers and friends. When he bid them farewell, he also wished the Japanese guests well from the bottom of his heart. ·Our Correspondent· (Attached picture)

    伏老在昨晚的酒会上
    △伏罗希洛夫主席昨天穿着一套浅蓝色的西服，系着银底蓝点的领带。在水银灯的聚照之下，容光焕发，精神矍铄。他走到那里，那里的空气就更加显得活跃起来，那里就成为全场贯注的中心。他的魁伟健壮的身材同他平易近人的诚挚态度一样，给人以极为深刻的印象。
    △伏罗希洛夫主席来到了将军们的席位面前，这里坐着杨成武上将和萧向荣中将和其他许多将军们。周恩来总理向贵宾作了介绍。伏罗希洛夫主席看到中国的战友立刻同他们一一热情地握手。接着就说：“我爱将军，但是，我反对战争！”这位久征沙场、威震四海的苏联第一位元帅在这里深刻地表露了自己对和平的热爱。
    △在文艺界人士的席位上，坐着我国许多著名的作家和艺术家。周恩来总理把梅兰芳和程砚秋介绍给了贵宾。伏罗希洛夫主席一见是中国最著名的京剧演员，说愿意看到他们演的戏。总理接着答道，后天就可以。原来梅兰芳先生将要在4月18日举行的一个欢迎晚会上参加演出。
    △在中国帮助我们建设的许多苏联专家和在北京学习的苏联留学生也参加了这个酒会。伏罗希洛夫主席叮咛苏联专家说：你们在中国工作很好，像在自己的国家里一样。希望你们做更多的工作来促进中苏两国的友好。他还像慈父般地抚摸了苏联留学生的脸颊，要他们好好地学习中文，将来当个汉学家。
    △贵宾们还被介绍同正在北京访问的日本社会党访华亲善使节团的团员们见面。在这里，伏罗希洛夫向日本朋友们诚恳地表示了友好的祝愿。他说，日本、苏联和中国是近邻，理应进行友好合作。如果大家都有此意愿，就可以达到这个目的。日本客人们答道，这话说得很对，我们都应该作这样的努力。伏罗希洛夫紧接着又说：不仅在口头上这样说，而且要争取在实际上成为真正的兄弟和朋友。在同他们握别的时候，他还向日本客人们衷心地祝好。　　　·本报记者·（附图片）
