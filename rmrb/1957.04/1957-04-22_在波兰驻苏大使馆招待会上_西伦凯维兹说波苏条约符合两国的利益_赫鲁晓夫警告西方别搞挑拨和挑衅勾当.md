Xinhua News Agency, April 21st: According to TASS, the Polish Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Tadeusz Gede, held a reception on the afternoon of April 19th to commemorate the 12th anniversary of the signing of the Soviet-Polish Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance, and Post-War Cooperation and to mark the return of the Polish government delegation from their visit to Asian countries, during a stopover in the Soviet Union.

Cyrankiewicz and Khrushchev both spoke at the reception.

In his speech, Cyrankiewicz expressed his great pleasure at the opportunity to engage in sincere talks full of mutual understanding with Soviet comrades on issues of concern to the people of Poland and the Soviet Union, as well as on the assessment of relations with other countries and international cooperation.

Cyrankiewicz said that when we arrived in Moscow, we coincided with the 12th anniversary of the signing of the Polish-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Mutual Assistance, and Post-War Cooperation. This treaty was consolidated by the blood shed by Soviet and Polish soldiers in the Second World War. The treaty has stood the test of time, and it has always conformed to the national interests of Poland and the Soviet Union, as well as the fundamental interests of building socialism.

Cyrankiewicz spoke of the important significance of the Soviet government's declaration of October 30th and the Polish-Soviet joint statement of last November in the development of Polish-Soviet friendship. He said that our friendship has the broadest prospects.

In his speech, Khrushchev pointed out that socialist countries will do everything possible to strengthen their friendly relations with each other. He said that there had been some estrangement between the Soviet Union and Poland, and the enemies of communism had wanted to use this to undermine the relations between the two countries in order to achieve their own goals. But on the contrary, we must strengthen the truly socialist relations between our two countries. Our two countries have had different periods in history, including the fact that Russia and Poland have invaded each other. All this is in the past. We are now living in a new historical period, in which the two countries have established fraternal and friendly relations. Now your people have no better or closer friends than the people of socialist countries.

When talking about the equal relations between socialist countries, Khrushchev said, we love China not because of its large population, but because it has great ideas and undertakings and shares our views in building socialism, in the struggle for peace, and for the friendship of all peoples. China is the most populous country in the socialist camp, and Albania is the least populous country, but both countries are building socialism in the unified socialist family, and our relations with both countries are based on mutual assistance and cooperation. If we pursue a different policy, we are not communists.

Khrushchev said, we want to warn our enemies: don't mess with us, don't think of testing us with provocative riots like those created in Hungary. Currently, some people in foreign newspapers are clamoring to plot such riots in the German Democratic Republic. Be careful not to miscalculate. We have the power to stop it.

Khrushchev mentioned that some people are now courting Poland like a suitor pursuing a bride. They are trying to find forces in Poland that can be used against the Polish people's regime and socialist construction, and against the Soviet Union.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union has always helped the People's Republic of Poland in the past and now, and will not refuse to help you in the future.

We not only help socialist countries without any selfish motives, but also help non-socialist countries that are fighting for freedom and national independence without any selfish motives. We hope to strengthen friendship with other countries in order to safeguard world peace. We are willing to be friendly with all countries, including the United States.

    在波兰驻苏大使馆招待会上
    西伦凯维兹说波苏条约符合两国的利益  赫鲁晓夫警告西方别搞挑拨和挑衅勾当
    据新华社21日讯　据塔斯社报道，波兰驻苏联大使盖德4月19日下午为波兰政府代表团访问亚洲各国回国途中到达苏联和纪念苏波友好互助与战后合作条约签订十二周年举行了招待会。
    西伦凯维兹和赫鲁晓夫都在招待会上讲了话。
    西伦凯维兹在讲话中表示他非常高兴有机会同苏联同志就对波苏两国人民关心的问题以及对有关同其他国家的关系和国际合作的估价进行了充满相互谅解的诚恳交谈。
    西伦凯维兹说，当我们来到莫斯科的时候，正遇上波苏友好互助与战后合作条约签订十二周年。这个条约是用苏联和波兰士兵在第二次世界大战中流出的鲜血巩固下来的。这个条约经受了时间的考验，它过去和现在都符合波兰和苏联的国家利益，也符合建设社会主义的根本利益。
    西伦凯维兹谈到去年10月30日苏联政府的宣言和去年11月波苏联合声明对发展波苏友谊的重要意义。他说，我们的友谊有着最广阔的前途。
    赫鲁晓夫在讲话中指出，社会主义国家将尽一切努力加强彼此的友好关系。他说，苏波两国间曾经有过某种的隔膜，共产主义的敌人曾经想利用这一点来破坏两国的关系，以达到它们自己的目的。但是我们相反地要加强我们两国间真正社会主义的关系。我们两国在历史上曾经有过不同的时期，其中也有过俄国同波兰互相侵略的事实。这一切都是过去的事。我们现在生活在新的历史时期中，两国建立了兄弟友好关系。现在你们的人民没有比社会主义国家的人民更好更亲密的朋友了。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到社会主义国家的平等关系时说，我们爱中国并不是因为它人口众多，而是因为它有伟大的思想和事业，在建设社会主义、在为和平和各国人民友谊的斗争中同我们有共同的观点。中国是社会主义阵营中人口最多的国家，阿尔巴尼亚是人口最少的国家，可是这两个国家都在社会主义的统一大家庭中建设社会主义，我们同这两个国家的关系都是建立在互相帮助和合作的基础上。如果我们奉行另外一种政策，我们就不是共产主义者。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们要警告我们的敌人：不要同我们闹着玩，不要想用像在匈牙利所制造的挑衅性暴乱来考验我们。目前有人在外国报纸上叫嚣着要在德意志民主共和国策划这种暴乱。请小心，不要打错算盘。我们是有力量加以制止的。
    赫鲁晓夫谈到，现在有些人像追求一位未婚妻那样在向波兰献殷勤。他们企图在波兰找到能够用来反对波兰人民政权和社会主义建设、用来反对苏联的力量。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联过去和现在始终帮助波兰人民共和国，将来也不会拒绝帮助你们。
    我们不仅帮助社会主义国家没有任何自私目的，而且帮助那些正在为自由和民族独立而斗争的非社会主义国家也没有任何自私目的。我们希望同其他国家加强友好是为了保卫世界和平。我们愿意同一切国家友好，包括美国在内。
