Baoding Electric News: The broad cadres in Hebei Province have universally studied and discussed Chairman Mao’s speech at the Supreme State Conference on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, and are currently conveying it to the grassroots Party members in urban and rural areas.

After studying and discussing Chairman Mao’s speech, the broad cadres have initially delineated the boundary between contradictions between ourselves and the enemy and contradictions among the people. Liu Xishan, the organization minister of the Wangdu County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, said: “Before listening to Chairman Mao’s speech, I sometimes regarded contradictions among the people as antagonistic contradictions. For example, I took a hostile attitude toward some members who were dissatisfied with the agricultural cooperatives, which further aroused their dissatisfaction. Now I know that problems among the people must be resolved through persuasion and education.” Sun Guobin, the director of Baoding Power Plant, said: In the past, whenever I heard that workers were dissatisfied with leading cadres, I felt uneasy. Now I understand that the key lies in overcoming my own subjectivism and bureaucracy and relying on the workers to run the enterprise well. After studying, many cadres feel more confident and have strengthened their confidence in doing their jobs well.

    河北广大干部学习讨论毛主席的讲话
    初步划清人民内部矛盾和敌我矛盾的界限
    本报保定电　河北省广大干部已经普遍地学习和讨论了毛主席在最高国务会议上关于正确地处理人民内部矛盾的问题的讲话，并正在向城乡基层党员传达。
    广大干部经过学习和讨论毛主席的这一讲话，初步划清了敌我矛盾同人民内部矛盾的界限。中共望都县委组织部长刘喜善说：“我在听毛主席的讲话以前，有时就把人民内部矛盾当成敌对性的矛盾。如对一些对农业社不满的社员抱敌视态度，结果更引起了这些人的不满。现在知道人民内部的问题，必须通过说服教育的方式解决。”保定发电厂厂长孙国斌说：早先一听说工人对领导干部不满，心里就没底。现在明白了，关键在于自己克服主观主义和官僚主义，依靠工人把企业办好。许多干部经过学习，心里有了底，增强了做好工作的信心。
