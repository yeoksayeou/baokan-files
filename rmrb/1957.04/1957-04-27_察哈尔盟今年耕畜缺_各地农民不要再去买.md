    This Year's Shortage of Draught Animals in Chahar League, Farmers in Various Places Should Not Go There to Buy
    Chahar League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, suffered a severe snow disaster last winter, and livestock casualties were extremely serious. The local draught animals cannot even meet the needs of local agricultural production, so it is even more impossible to supply them to areas outside the region.
    Recently, many agricultural cooperatives in North China have sent people with letters of introduction to the Chahar League area to purchase draught animals. Each group of farmers buying draught animals consists of three to five people, or even more than ten people. The journey is long, the travel expenses are high, manpower and financial resources are wasted, and the losses are great. Therefore, we suggest that local governments and relevant departments promptly inform the agricultural cooperatives not to go to Chahar League to purchase livestock again, so as to avoid futile trips.

    察哈尔盟今年耕畜缺  各地农民不要再去买
    内蒙古自治区察哈尔盟去冬雪大成灾，牲畜伤亡极为严重，当地耕畜，还不能满足当地农业生产上的需要，因此，对区外的供应更难能为力。
    最近，华北各地有不少农业社派人持介绍信赴察哈尔盟一带购买耕畜，每伙购买耕畜的农民三至五人，多至十余人不等。路途遥远，盘费很大，浪费了人力和财力，损失很大。因此，我们建议各地政府及有关部门，及时告诉农业社，不要再到察哈尔盟购买牲畜，以免徒劳往返。　赵玉书
