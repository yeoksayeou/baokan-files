Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, April 27th - The Communist Party cadres of the Wuhan Public Utilities Bureau respect the authority of Director Zhou Huanzhang (Central Committee Member of the China Democratic National Construction Association), a member of a democratic party, and have established a good working relationship with him.

The Communist Party organization and cadres of the Wuhan Public Utilities Bureau have consistently supported the leadership of Director Zhou Huanzhang (member of the China Democratic National Construction Association) and actively assisted him in his work. Communist Party section chiefs and managers of affiliated companies in the bureau take the initiative to ask for instructions from and report to Director Zhou when dealing with work issues. All instructions given by Director Zhou are followed by subordinate organizations. Before each routine bureau affairs meeting, office meeting, or general staff meeting, or the Municipal People's Congress meeting (Zhou Huanzhang is also a member of the Wuhan Municipal People's Committee), Communist Party cadres actively collect and organize materials for him according to Director Zhou's instructions, so that he can make reports or speeches on behalf of the entire bureau. Not only can he see telegrams and documents sent by higher-level government departments, but also, for work needs, the Communist Party organization provides him with relevant internal Communist Party documents and telegrams to read. Liang Tianyi, the Communist Party Deputy Director, also respects Zhou Huanzhang very much. He actively carries out whatever Director Zhou asks him to do. Once, Director Zhou disagreed with a draft speech written by the secretary, so Deputy Director Liang personally rewrote it overnight, which made Director Zhou very satisfied. With these good working conditions, Director Zhou is very enthusiastic about his work. He often says to old friends: the situation of having a title without power does not exist in the Public Utilities Bureau.

Sincerely consulting on matters and respecting each other's opinions is another key to the good cooperative working relationship in the Public Utilities Bureau. When dealing with major issues, leading cadres always issue instructions only when a consensus has been reached. When opinions still cannot be unified after discussion, they go to the masses to find solutions. Once, Director Zhou, based on the opinions of representatives to the Municipal People's Congress, wanted to decide to solve all the problems of water leakage within the water pipes inside the users' water meters in a short period. Deputy Director Liang believed that Director Zhou's wish was good, but because he had only been working in the bureau for a short time and did not fully understand the strength of the affiliated companies, he went to the grassroots level with the Director to observe specifically and listen to the opinions of the staff. From on-the-spot observations, Director Zhou found that the government's financial and human resources could not afford to solve all problems at once, and corresponding measures could only be taken to solve them gradually one by one, so he revised his original insistence. Through many times of going deep into reality and into the masses, he not only learned the working method of following the mass line, but also corrected his impetuous mood in practical work, so that his subjective wishes could often conform to objective reality.

In terms of living issues, Party and non-Party cadres in the bureau are modest and yield to each other, and their feelings are harmonious. After work, they often visit each other's homes, chat, or talk about work issues. Recently, Director Zhou was sick and recuperating, and Communist Party cadres often visited him, which made Director Zhou very touched.

However, this good phenomenon did not exist from the beginning. According to the person in charge of the Communist Party group in the bureau, in the early days of Director Zhou's arrival in the bureau in 1955, Communist Party cadres in the bureau only asked for instructions from and reported to the Communist Party Deputy Director. After the Party organization discovered this situation, it conducted an in-depth education on the United Front policy within the Party, criticized sectarianism, and only then was this good cooperative working relationship established.

### 党内外同志亲密合作互助共事  保证有职有权　遇事诚恳相商  武汉公用事业管理局树立良好榜样

    党内外同志亲密合作互助共事
    保证有职有权　遇事诚恳相商
    武汉公用事业管理局树立良好榜样
    新华社武汉27日电　武汉市公用事业管理局的共产党员干部，尊重民主党派成员局长的职权，和这位局长建立了良好的合作共事关系。
    武汉市公用事业管理局共产党组织和党员干部，一贯支持这个局的民主党派成员局长周焕章（民建中央委员）的领导，并积极帮助他进行工作。局里的共产党员科长和所属公司的经理在处理工作问题时，都主动地向周局长请示汇报，凡周局长作的指示，下属机构都能遵照执行。在每次例行的局务会议、办公会议或全局职工大会、市人民代表大会会议（周焕章也是武汉市人民委员会委员）举行前，共产党员干部们都积极地按照周局长的指示为他收集和整理材料，由他代表全局去作报告或发言。他不仅能看到上级政府部门发来的电报和文件，为了工作需要，有关的共产党内的文件和电报，共产党组织也供给他阅读。共产党员副局长梁天益也很尊重周焕章。凡是周局长要他作的事，他都积极执行。有一次，周局长对秘书写的一份发言稿不同意，梁副局长就亲自动手连夜改写好，使周局长很满意。有了这些好的工作条件，周局长工作起来劲头很大。他经常对老朋友们说：在公用事业管理局有职无权的情况是不存在的。
    遇事诚恳相商，互相尊重对方意见，这是公用事业管理局搞好合作共事关系的另一个关键。在处理较大的问题时，领导干部总是在意见取得一致时才向下发指示。遇到某些问题经过商量后意见仍不能一致时，他们就到群众那里去找办法。有一次，周局长根据市人民代表大会代表意见，想决定把用户水表以内水管漏水等问题在短期内全部解决。梁副局长认为周局长这种愿望是好的，但是由于他来局工作不久，对所属各公司的力量不够了解，因此就和局长一道深入到基层去具体观察，听取职工群众意见。周局长从实地观察中，发现想急于一时解决所有问题是政府财力、人力所办不到的，只能采取相应措施逐步逐个解决，就修正了自己原来坚持的意见。经过多次深入实际深入群众，他不仅学会了走群众路线的工作方法，而且在实际工作中纠正了自己的急躁情绪，使自己的主观愿望能经常符合客观实际情况。
    在生活问题上，这个局的党内外干部都互相谦让，感情融洽。工余时，他们经常互相串门，拉家常，或谈谈工作上的问题。最近，周局长生病休养，共产党员干部们经常去探望他，使周局长很感动。
    但是，这种好现象并不是一开始就有的，据这个局的中共党组负责人说，在1955年周局长来到这个局的初期，局里的共产党员干部有事只向共产党员副局长请示报告。党组织发现这个情况以后，在党内进行了一次深入的统一战线政策的教育，批判了宗派主义情绪，才使这种良好的合作共事关系建立起来。
