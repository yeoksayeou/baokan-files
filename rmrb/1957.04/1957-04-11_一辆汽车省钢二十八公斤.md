    A Car Saves Twenty-Eight Kilograms of Steel
    (Our Dispatch) Manufacturing a Liberation brand car can now save an average of 28.8 kilograms of steel. This is a major achievement in conserving steel by the workers of a workshop—the forging workshop—of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, who have tried every possible means. Recently, this workshop produced all the forgings for a car. Because they utilized the material heads, flash, and tong grips, they saved 24.2 kilograms of steel compared to the past; by shortening the blanking size of the raw material, they saved another 4.68 kilograms of steel. If we calculate based on manufacturing 7,000 cars this year, we can save more than 200 tons of steel.

    一辆汽车省钢二十八公斤
    本报讯　制造一辆解放牌汽车，平均能节省二十八点八公斤钢材。这是第一汽车制造厂一个车间——锻工车间职工千方百计节约钢材的一大成果。这个车间最近生产一辆汽车的全部锻件，因为利用料头、飞边、钳子夹头，所以比过去节省二十四点二公斤钢材；由于缩短了毛胚下料的尺寸，又节省钢材四点六八公斤。如以今年制造七千辆汽车计算，就可以节省二百多吨钢材。
