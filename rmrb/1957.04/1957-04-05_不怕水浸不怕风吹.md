Not Afraid of Flooding, Not Afraid of Wind
    The Zhenjiang Yingchang Match Factory, a joint state-private enterprise in Jiangsu Province, has recently successfully trial-produced a type of moisture-resistant match. These matches can be soaked in water for one or two hours, and when taken out and wiped dry, they can still be struck and lit. Preliminary estimates after half a month of trial production indicate that the cost is not too high. The factory has now submitted the trial production results to the higher authorities. Once approved, they can be officially produced and supplied to the market.

    In addition, the factory has also trial-produced a type of colored match that emits red and green flames when burning and is also windproof.

    不怕水浸不怕风吹
    江苏省公私合营镇江荧昌火柴厂新近试制成功了一种抗潮火柴，这种火柴放在水里浸上一、二个钟点，取出来揩干了照样一擦就着。经半个月试制的初步估算，成本也不太大，现在，该厂已将试制结果呈报上级，批准了就可以正式生产，供应市场。
    另外，该厂还试制一种采色火柴，在燃烧时能发出红色和绿色的火焰，并且有防风作用。
