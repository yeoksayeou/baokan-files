    Watching "Little Partners"
    Su Fang
    What could be more admirable than unyielding revolutionary will? What could be more endearing than childlike innocence? Here, the two are blended together, concentrated in a pair of revolutionary little partners. Therefore, when I see the various activities of the two little protagonists, Little Wang and Little Rong, in the movie "Little Partners," I can't help but feel a surge of emotion!
    These little partners, the older one is only fifteen years old, and the younger one is only twelve. At this age, for today's children, they should still be playing on the playground and learning in the classroom; they should still be receiving the caresses of their mothers and the teachings of their teachers. However, in the old society, these kinds of happiness could not be enjoyed by every child. More children had a completely different fate: some were devastated and damaged; some were tempted and corrupted. But some also embarked on the arduous road of revolution, and under the cultivation and education of the Party, broke through many obstacles and grew up sturdily. Little Wang and Little Rong are two of them.
    On the revolutionary journey, one will always encounter many difficulties; but Little Wang and Little Rong do not care about these. They fearlessly follow the revolution and do their best to complete the various tasks assigned to them by the Party. When I saw the interesting scene of them hurrying along with the little donkey, cleverly fooling the greedy and cunning Japanese devils, and successfully delivering the intelligence to their own people, I couldn't help but laugh from the bottom of my heart at their cleverness and wisdom. After Little Rong was injured, she still endured great pain, clinging tightly to the tree trunk with her hands in order to support her almost falling body and monitor the enemy's movements. Her strength and courage moved me deeply. The Party's cultivation and education, and the tempering and honing of revolutionary struggle, have enabled these little partners to not only maintain the purity and innocence of their hearts, but also to grow into witty and brave iron warriors. Therefore, their childhood radiates an extraordinary brilliance, and the momentum contained in their small bodies is so great that it can shake mountains!
    In addition to their combat achievements being inspiring, the sincerity of their friendship is also very touching. This includes not only the ordinary childish congeniality: playing together, or confiding in each other about innocent fantasies; but also the deeper love between comrades: mutual support in life, mutual comfort in spirit, and working together to complete combat missions. These are very clearly expressed in the scenes of Little Rong mending clothes for Little Wang, Little Wang giving the cloth package his mother brought to him to Little Rong (Little Rong's mother was arrested and imprisoned), Little Wang and Little Rong going to deliver intelligence together, and so on. This is the friendship of combat, it is the most sublime, and it will never be destroyed.
    The two young actors who play Little Wang and Little Rong in the film are quite competent. Although in some scenes, perhaps due to being too nervous, they seem too serious and too adult-like, which is not entirely consistent with the identities and ages of the characters in the play; Little Wang sometimes speaks too fast, which also makes it difficult to hear clearly. But in general, their simple acting skills are still appropriate and lovable. And a story like "Little Partners" is very meaningful for children, and even for adults. Today, children are living an unprecedentedly happy life. Happiness sometimes inevitably makes them spoiled, like flower branches in a greenhouse, unable to withstand a little breeze and drizzle. Then letting them know what a difficult journey the previous generation of children fought through, and letting them appreciate that the fruits of revolutionary victory were also permeated with the blood and sweat of the little soldiers, will inevitably give them great encouragement, so that they will cherish the fruits of victory all the more.

    看“小伙伴”
    苏方
    什么能比坚贞不屈的革命意志更令人景仰？什么能比童稚的天真更引人喜爱？在这里，两者却揉合在一起，凝聚在一对革命的小伙伴的身上了。因此在看到电影“小伙伴”中的两个小主人翁小王和小荣的种种活动时，我总抑制不住心头的激动！
    这对小伙伴，大的不过十五岁，小的只有十二岁。这样的年纪，对于今天的孩子们来说，应该还在操场上嬉闹，课室里学习；应该还受着母亲的爱抚，师长的教导。然而在旧社会里，这种种幸福，并不能为每个孩子所享受。更多的孩子，却有着和这迥然不同的命运：有的被摧残了，损伤了；有的被诱惑了，堕落了。但是也有的踏上了艰苦的革命的道路，在党的培养和教育下，突破了重重障碍而茁壮地成长起来。小王和小荣便是这里面的两个。
    革命的途程上，总会碰到许多困难的；但是小王和小荣不管这些。他们无畏地追随革命，竭尽心力去完成党交给他们的各种任务。当我看到他们得得地赶着小毛驴，巧妙地骗过贪婪狡猾的日本鬼子，顺利地把情报送到自己人手里这个有趣的情节时，不禁因为他们的机灵智慧而由衷地笑了起来。小荣受伤以后，仍然忍受着极大的痛楚，用手紧攀着树干，以便支撑着快要下坠的身体，监视敌人的行踪。她的坚强和勇敢，更使我深深地受到感动。党的培育和教养，革命斗争的陶冶和磨炼，使得这对小伙伴不仅保持了心灵的纯洁和天真，更使他们成长为机智英勇的钢铁战士。因而他们的童年也就异乎寻常地放射出绚烂的光彩，他们小小身躯中蕴蓄的气势也宏大得足以震撼山岳了！
    除了他们的战斗业绩使人振奋外，他们的友谊的真挚也是十分感人的。这里包含的不只是普通的孩子气的投契：一起玩笑，或者互相倾吐一下天真的幻想；而是比这更为深远的同志间的热爱：生活上的互相扶持，心灵上的彼此慰籍，以及同心合力地去完成战斗任务。这些在小荣为小王补衣服，小王把母亲捎给自己的布包送给小荣（小荣的母亲被捕入狱了），小王和小荣一起去送情报等等情节中，十分显著地表现了出来。这是战斗的友谊，它是最崇高的，是永远不会破灭的。
    影片中扮演小王和小荣的两个小演员还算称职。虽然有些场面，或许由于过于紧张的缘故吧，他们显得太严肃、太大人气了些，和剧中人的身份、年龄不尽吻合；小王有时说话太快，也使人不容易听清楚。但总的说来，他们素朴的演技仍然是得体的，令人喜爱的。而“小伙伴”这样的故事，对于孩子，甚至对于大人，都是很有意义的。今天，孩子们过着前所未有的幸福生活。幸福有时不免会使他们娇惯些，就像温室里的花枝一样，经不起一点微风细雨。那么让他们知道前一代的孩子们曾经在怎样苦难的历程上战斗过，让他们体味到革命胜利成果中也曾渗透过小战士们的血和汗，这必然会给他们很大的鼓励，从而使他们加倍珍惜胜利的果实。（附图片）
