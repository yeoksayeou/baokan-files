Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 8th - The largest automated coal preparation plant south of the Yangtze River in our country, designed with the help of Polish experts and to be equipped with Polish machinery, is under construction near Zhuzhou city.

The factory officially started construction in late September last year. Currently, several hundred thousand cubic meters of earthwork are nearing completion, and about ten kilometers of dedicated railway lines have been built within the plant. Large-scale civil engineering construction will also begin soon.

Zhuzhou is located at the intersection of the Yuehan and Zhegan railways. After the coal preparation plant is completed, the raw coal produced by the state-owned Pingxiang and Zixing coal mines can be directly transported to the plant for washing and sorting. The refined coal produced after washing will be directly transported to Wuhan by train to supply the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex.

    波兰帮助建设的株洲选煤厂正加紧施工
    新华社长沙8日电　波兰专家帮助设计并将用波兰机器装备的我国长江南岸最大的一个自动化选煤厂，正在株洲市郊加紧建设。
    这个工厂是在去年9月下旬正式开工的。现在，几十万土石方工程快要完工，厂内已修建起十公里左右的专用铁路线；不久，土木建筑工程也要大规模地开始了。
    株洲位于粤汉和浙赣铁路的交叉线上。选煤厂建成以后，国营萍乡和资兴两个煤矿生产的原煤，就可以用火车直接运到厂内洗选，经过洗选的精煤，将直接用火车运到武汉供给武汉钢铁联合企业。
