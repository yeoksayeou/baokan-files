More United or More Contradictory?
——A Debate at the Shanxi Provincial Propaganda Work Conference
Wu Xiang

After Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference on the correct handling of contradictions among the people was conveyed at the Shanxi Provincial Propaganda Work Conference held from March 26 to April 5, it aroused strong ideological repercussions. The 682 people who attended the meeting unanimously felt greatly enlightened, educated, and encouraged. Their horizons were broadened, and their thinking was enlightened. Connecting with the current ideological trends of all strata of people and the Party in the province, everyone launched heated and unconstrained discussions in group meetings and plenary sessions. Some reflected that they had poured out words that had been stuck in their stomachs for many years, and some reflected that their thinking had taken a 180-degree turn. The rich and vivid ideological content became a major feature of the meeting, which was unprecedented in previous propaganda conferences in Shanxi Province. The meeting was presided over by the First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee from beginning to end, and he also made a summary at the end. Those attending the meeting included not only comrades directly engaged in propaganda and education work in various fields, but also secretaries of local Party committees, municipal Party committees, county Party committees, and commissioners of various administrative offices. There were 92 non-Party comrades attending the meeting. All the issues of the meeting were jointly studied and resolved by Party members and non-Party members. This not only enhanced the enthusiasm of non-Party comrades but also enabled Party members to hear many opinions that could not be heard in Party meetings, thereby gaining more valuable insights. Of course, the contradictions among the people are a very important new theoretical issue in the development of Marxism-Leninism, and it is impossible to fully understand it in a short meeting. Many one-sided opinions that affirmed everything or negated everything appeared in the debate, and some were not completely resolved. However, after study and discussion, everyone began to have a preliminary and clear understanding of the contradictions among the people, and thus had confidence, methods, and strength in how to correctly handle the contradictions among the people.

Many issues were raised at the meeting, and many issues that caused controversy, one of which was fundamental and universal was: After the victory of the socialist revolution, is the people more united? Or are they more contradictory?

When some veteran Party cadres first heard about the contradictions among the people, they felt very sudden, and some even had resistance: "We are serving the people, how can we have contradictions with the people?" A more common saying is: "Most areas of Shanxi are old revolutionary base areas, with a good work foundation and high mass awareness. There are no internal contradictions." These comrades are consciously or unconsciously intoxicated with busy and constantly successful administrative work and have long neglected political and ideological work. Their minds are no longer clear. They overestimated the positive side of the current ideological trends and completely failed to see the negative side, so they were complacent, as if everything was peaceful. During the discussion, this dangerous mood was shattered by many facts. From the perspective of the entire province, the socialist consciousness of the people is increasing day by day, and socialist ideology occupies an absolute advantage in the social ideological field. However, new ideological problems have also emerged. Among the peasants, although the vast majority of people support and love socialism, there are also a small number of people who have relatively serious ideological problems and dissatisfaction, mainly wealthy middle peasants and landlords and rich peasants who have not been well reformed. They doubt the superiority of collectivization; they are not content with agricultural production and mountain construction, and they have the idea of ​​"abandoning agriculture for industry" and "going down the mountain to enter the city"; they are dissatisfied with the price difference between industrial and agricultural products, the treatment of workers, the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, and the amount of grain supply. Among the workers, with the large increase in non-working-class components, some people have developed individualistic ideas that excessively pursue material enjoyment, competing for wages, competing for grades, and being picky; they are dissatisfied with the material supply work and complain that they cannot buy things even if they have money; some workers from other places complain that Shanxi's wages are low and life is hard; some have even developed to the point of feigning illness, absenteeism, and violating labor discipline. The ideological problems of some young students, especially those from exploiting-class families, are also quite serious. They are dissatisfied with school equipment and teaching quality; dissatisfied with eating coarse grains; unwilling to work in mountainous areas and rural areas after graduation; dissatisfied with their majors; some foreign students think that "Shanxi is backward, Shanxi is bitter, and Shanxi has no future." Some even call Shanxi Province "Sad Province" and Taiyuan City "Too Wrong City." After the above-mentioned ideological problems were overturned, some people went to the other extreme and had the illusion that something big was wrong and were in a panic all day long. Some even think that "the relationship between the Party and the masses now is not as good as the relationship between the reactionary ruling class and the masses in the past. In the past, the reactionary ruling class asked the masses for food and money and didn't care about anything else. The masses could only complain about the sky and the earth if they had problems; now we manage the masses too much and interfere too much, so the masses complain about the Party and the government if they have any problems." Some people couldn't help but complain: "In the past, we led the masses to revolt against the enemy, and we revolted for a lifetime, but in the end, we came up with a contradiction among the people, and the spearhead was aimed at ourselves." So, how should we estimate the situation and extent of the contradictions among the people? After the victory of the socialist revolution, is the people more united? Or are they more contradictory? This question has aroused fierce debate.

Opinions are varied. Some people think that contradictions among the people existed in the past, have developed now, and will continue in the future; some people think that they did not exist in the past, only exist now, and will continue in the future; others think that this is a temporary phenomenon in the period of great transformation, did not exist in the past, and will not exist in the future. Everyone took out their notes of Chairman Mao's speech and read them repeatedly, thinking carefully. As the thinking deepened, the opinions gradually approached. Finally, everyone agreed: Contradictions among the people existed in the past, and they did not suddenly emerge today. However, because the main contradiction in the past was the contradiction between the enemy and us, and we mainly solved the contradiction between the enemy and us, the contradiction among the people only occupied a secondary and subordinate position, so it did not attract special attention. Some comrades said: "In the past, there were also small contradictions between each other, but a family is always a family. When you see the enemy in front of you, you can't care about those things." What about now? The victory of the new-democratic revolution in 1949 resolved the contradictions between the Chinese people and imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism; the great upsurge of the socialist revolution in 1956 basically resolved the contradictions between the working class and the bourgeoisie. The contradiction between the enemy and us has been basically resolved, and the contradictions among the people are also more exposed. Some people criticized those comrades who avoided the contradictions among the people: "Contradictions are objective existences, and you can't deny them. In fact, contradictions are not terrible, on the contrary, they are the driving force for the development and progress of all things. If you study 'On Contradiction', you will understand that everything has contradictions, and without contradictions, there will be no movement and development. This is true of nature, and it is also true of human society. Although socialism has resolved the contradiction between the enemy and us, there are still contradictions among the people. If there are no contradictions at all, how can we continue to develop?" This opinion was agreed by many people, and some people added: "Chairman Mao instructed us that the contradictions between the enemy and us and the contradictions among the people are two different types of contradictions, one is antagonistic and the other is non-antagonistic, and they must not be confused. This is very important. We all admit that contradictions always exist. Old contradictions are resolved, and new contradictions arise; new contradictions are resolved, and newer contradictions arise. Each time a contradiction is resolved, things move forward. The nature of the contradictions among the people and the contradictions between the enemy and us are completely different, and they are put forward on the basis of resolving the contradictions between the enemy and us. Solving the contradictions between the enemy and us has gone through a long period of revolutionary struggle. In the struggle, the people's consciousness has been raised, and the Party has also been tempered, forming a great unity among the people. It is by relying on this united force that we have achieved the victory of the two revolutions, eliminated or are about to eliminate the exploiting classes, and basically resolved the contradiction between the enemy and us. Today the people are advanced, not backward; contradictions among the people are new contradictions that arise on the basis of new unity. We must not deny the progress and unity of the people because of the exposure of these new contradictions." At this point, everyone's opinions were unified, and the understanding of the contradictions among the people was relatively deep.

At this time, many people examined the one-sidedness of their thinking methods. Some said: "I originally regarded unity and contradiction as two incompatible things. If there is unity, there is no contradiction. If there is contradiction, then there must be disunity. So I can't understand the new contradictions that arise on the basis of new unity." Those comrades who thought that they had been revolutionizing for a lifetime and finally came up with a contradiction among the people also understood. They realized that although the Party and the government serve the people and work hard for the interests of the people, because the leaders and the people are in different positions in national life and observe problems from different angles, there must still be contradictions. Although leaders are better able to see long-term interests and overall interests, they are also more likely to ignore the specific situation and immediate demands of the people. If they commit bureaucracy, the contradictions will be even greater. Everyone also talked about the fact that there are many aspects of the contradictions among the people, but the most important is the contradiction between the leaders and the people. Because the leaders are facing the whole and facing all parts. Therefore, the contradictions between the various parts of the people are not only directly manifested as contradictions between each other, but also as contradictions against the leaders at the same time. Some comrades have this experience: "You say that he is dissatisfied with the workers and thinks that the workers' wages are high! In his bones, isn't he criticizing our leaders for being unfair?" Therefore, everyone believes that in studying the contradictions among the people, we must focus on studying the contradictions between the leaders and the people; in solving the contradictions among the people, we must also focus on solving the contradictions between the leaders and the people.

    更团结了，还是更矛盾了？
    ——记山西省宣传工作会议上的一个争论
    吴象
    毛主席在最高国务会议上关于正确地处理人民内部矛盾问题的讲话，在3月26日至4月5日召开的山西省宣传工作会议上传达以后，激起了强烈的思想反响。到会的六百八十二人，一致感到受了莫大的启示、教育和鼓舞，眼界扩大了，思想开朗了。大家联系目前全省各阶层人民和党内的思想动向，在小组会和大会上展开了热烈的毫无拘束的讨论。有人反映自己蹩在肚里多年的话都倒出来了，有人反映自己思想上是转了一百八十度的弯。思想内容丰富生动，成为会议的一大特点，是山西省以往各次宣传会议所没有过的。这次会议自始至终由省委第一书记主持，最后并由他做了总结。出席会议的不仅有各方面直接从事宣传教育工作的同志，而且有各地委、市委、县委书记和各专署专员。参加会议的非党同志有九十二人。会议的所有问题，都是党内党外共同研究、共同解决。这样既提高了非党同志的积极性，又使党员同志能听到许多党内会议听不到的意见，从而得到更多更宝贵的启示。当然，人民内部矛盾，是马克思列宁主义发展中一个非常重要的新的理论问题，不可能在一次时间短促的会议上就领会透彻。争论中出现过不少肯定一切或者否定一切的片面性的意见，有些并未完全得到解决。但是，经过学习和讨论，大家对于人民内部的矛盾，开始有了初步的明确的认识了，从而对如何正确地处理人民内部的矛盾，也就有了信心、办法和力量。
    会议上提出的问题很多，曾经引起争论的问题也很多，其中带有根本性和普遍性的一个问题是：社会主义革命胜利之后，人民内部是更团结了？还是更矛盾了？
    有一部分老党员干部，刚一听到人民内部矛盾的时候，感到很突然，有的甚至有抵触情绪：“我们是为人民服务的，怎么和人民群众还有矛盾？”比较更普遍的说法是：“山西大部地区是老区，工作基础好，群众觉悟高，不存在什么内部矛盾。”这些同志自觉或不自觉地为繁忙的不断取得成绩的行政业务所陶醉，长期忽视政治思想工作，头脑已不大清醒。他们过高地估计了目前思想动向的积极的一面，根本看不到消极的一面，因而自安自得，仿佛一切都是太平无事。讨论中，这种危险的情绪被许多事实打破了。从全省来看，人民群众的社会主义觉悟正在日益提高，社会主义思想在社会思想领域中已居绝对优势。但是，新的思想问题也出来了。在农民中，虽然绝大多数人对社会主义是拥护的，热爱的，但也有少数人有比较严重的思想问题和不满情绪，其中主要是富裕中农和没有改造好的地主、富农。他们怀疑合作化的优越性；不安心农业生产和山区建设，有“弃农就工”、“下山进城”的思想；对工农业产品差价、工人待遇、粮食统购统销政策和粮食供应量有不满情绪。在工人中，随着非工人阶级成份的大量增加，有一部分人滋长着过多追求物质享受的个人主义思想，争工资、争级别、挑肥拣瘦；对物资供应工作不满，埋怨有钱买不上东西；有些来自外地的工人嫌山西工资低、生活苦；有些甚至发展到装病、旷工，违反劳动纪律。一部分青年学生，特别是出身于剥削阶级家庭的学生，思想问题也相当严重，他们对学校设备、教学质量不满；对吃粗粮不满；毕业后不愿到山区和农村工作；不满自己的专业；有些外来的学生认为“山西土、山西苦，山西没前途。”甚至把山西省叫成“伤心省”，太原市叫成“太冤市”。上面说的这些思想问题翻倒出来以后，有些人又偏到了另一个极端，发生了大事不妙、惶惶不可终日的错觉。有人甚至认为“现在党和群众的关系还不如过去反动统治阶级和群众的关系好。过去的反动统治阶级向群众要了粮款就什么也不管了，群众有问题也只能怨天、怨地；现在我们对群众管得太宽，干涉得过多，所以群众有什么问题也怨党、怨政府。”还有人不胜感慨地发牢骚：“过去我们领导群众革敌人的命，革了一辈子，结果却来了个人民内部矛盾，锋芒对着我们自己了。”那么，对人民内部矛盾的情况和程度究竟应该怎样估计呢？社会主义革命胜利之后，人民内部是更团结了？还是更矛盾了？这问题便引起了激烈的争论。
    意见是各式各样的。有的人认为，人民内部的矛盾过去就有，现在发展了，今后还有；有的人认为过去没有，现在才有的，今后还会有；也有人认为这是大转变时期的暂时现象，过去没有，今后也不会有。大家都把毛主席讲话的笔记找出来，反复地看，细细地想。思想深入了，意见也逐渐接近。终于都同意：人民内部矛盾过去就存在着，并不是今天才突然冒出来的。但是因为过去主要的矛盾是敌我矛盾，我们主要解决的也是敌我矛盾，人民内部矛盾只居于次要的、从属的地位，所以没有引起特别的注意。有的同志说：“过去相互间也闹过小矛盾，但一家人总是一家人，一眼看敌人在面前，就顾不上说那些了。”现在呢，1949年新民主主义革命的胜利，解决了中国人民与帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的矛盾；1956年伟大的社会主义革命高潮，又基本上解决了工人阶级和资产阶级的矛盾。敌我矛盾基本上解决了，人民内部矛盾也比较显露了。有人对那些讳避人民内部矛盾的同志提出批评：“矛盾是客观存在着的东西，你不承认也不行。事实上矛盾并不可怕，相反的，它倒是一切事物发展和进步的动力。你学学‘矛盾论’就会懂得，什么东西都有矛盾，没有矛盾，也就没有运动和发展。自然界如此，人类社会也是如此。社会主义虽然解决了敌我矛盾，但是还有人民内部的矛盾，如果根本没有矛盾，还怎么继续向前发展呢？”这意见得到许多人的赞同，有人又作了补充：“毛主席指示我们，敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾是两种性质不同的矛盾，一个是对抗性的，一个是非对抗性的，决不能混淆。这一点非常重要。我们都承认：矛盾永远存在。旧的矛盾解决了，新的矛盾又发生；新的矛盾解决了，更新的矛盾又发生。每次矛盾得到解决，事物就向前发展一步。人民内部矛盾和敌我矛盾的性质是完全不同的，是在解决了敌我矛盾的基础上提出来的。解决敌我矛盾经过了长期的革命斗争。在斗争中，人民的觉悟提高了，党也受到了锻炼，形成了人民内部伟大的团结。正是依靠这个团结的力量，我们才取得了两次革命的胜利，消灭了或将要消灭剥削阶级，基本上解决了敌我矛盾。今天人民是进步了，而不是落后了；人民内部矛盾，是在新的团结的基础上发生的新的矛盾。决不能因为这种新的矛盾的显露，就否认了人民的进步和团结。”到这里，大家的意见一致了，对人民内部矛盾的认识也比较深刻了。
    这时候，不少人都检查了自己思想方法上的片面性，有的说：“我原来把团结和矛盾看成水火不相容的两回事，既是团结就没有矛盾，说有矛盾那就一定不团结。所以理解不了在新的团结的基础上发生的新的矛盾。”那些认为革命了一辈子，最后革出来一个人民内部矛盾的同志，思想也通了。他们认识到虽然党和政府是为人民服务的，是为人民利益努力工作的，但是由于领导者和人民群众在国家生活中所处的地位不同，观察问题的角度不同，所以必然还有矛盾。领导者虽然比较能够看到长远利益和整体利益，但也比较容易忽视人民群众的具体情况和切身要求，如果犯了官僚主义，矛盾就更大了。大家还谈到：人民内部矛盾方面很多，但最重要的却是领导者和人民群众的矛盾。因为领导者是面向整体、面向各部分的。所以，各部分人民之间的矛盾，不仅直接表现为相互间的矛盾，而且也同时表现为对领导者的矛盾。有的同志就有这种体会：“你说他是对工人不满意，嫌工人工资高哩！骨子里还不是批评咱领导上处理不公？”因此，大家都认为，研究人民内部的矛盾，必须着重研究领导者和人民群众的矛盾；解决人民内部的矛盾，也必须着重解决领导者与人民群众的矛盾。
