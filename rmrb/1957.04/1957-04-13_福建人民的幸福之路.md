The train pulled out of Xiamen Station, rumbling across the magnificent sea dyke. Beautiful Xiamen, the bright pearl of the southeastern motherland and the heroic fortress of the coastal defense, is no longer an isolated island. The Yingtan-Xiamen Railway, like a powerful blood vessel, connects it to the heartland of the motherland, making it suddenly hundreds of times stronger, full of vitality, and even more magnificent!

Traveling west along the winding bay, the train gradually entered the beautiful and fertile Jiulong River Plain. The spring sunshine was bright, and looking out from the carriage, the mirror-like riverbanks and the vast rice paddies gleamed in the sunlight as if covered with a layer of ointment. The early rice seedlings that had already been planted were tender green and lovely. Interspersed with the rice paddies, the green mountains cover the wilderness, and the fruit trees are as green as the sea. This plain, centered on Longxi County and covering an area of four to five hundred square kilometers, is known as the "Ukraine of Fujian." Here, it is like spring all year round, the land is fertile, and grain crops can be harvested three times a year. Last year, Longxi and Haicheng counties were known throughout the country for achieving an average yield of over 1,000 jin per mu of rice. More than thirty kinds of exotic flowers and fruits grow here, and sweet lychees, longans, oranges, bananas, etc., produce seven to eight hundred thousand dan a year, with fresh fruits available in all seasons. Scientists believe that more than 300 kinds of subtropical crops, including rubber, cinchona trees, and lemongrass, can be developed here. In this uniquely blessed place, people in the old days were full of tragic experiences. Due to the massive dumping of cheap Taiwanese bananas and "Flag Brand Mandarins" first by Japanese imperialism and later by American imperialism, farmers who depended on fruit production angrily chopped down their fruit trees for firewood. After liberation, with the support of the People's Government, fruit production has gradually recovered and developed, but due to inconvenient transportation, the freight cost of transporting one ton of bananas to Shanghai was 34 times higher than transporting it from Guangzhou. A large amount of fruit had to be sold cheaply locally, often accumulating and rotting. With the opening of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway, those painful years are over. This year, the Longxi Special District is planning to comprehensively develop production based on this new change. The members of the agricultural and fruit production cooperatives in Longxi County are enthusiastically striving to achieve an average yield of 1,225 jin of grain per mu in the county this year, and also strive for each cooperative member household to have a total annual output value equivalent to 10,000 jin of grain!

The train crossed the Jiulong River and entered the territory of Hua'an and Zhangping to the northwest. The open plain gradually disappeared, replaced by winding and undulating mountain ranges. In the distant mountains, triangular red flags could be seen waving in the wind, and several geological survey teams were working. This area is a promising mining area. Not long ago, exploration teams discovered that rich deposits of dozens of minerals, including iron, coal, copper, manganese, lead, zinc, refractory clay, molybdenum, and limestone, were buried underground here. A magnetite mine in Luoyang Township near Zhangping Station has reserves of 20 million tons, with an iron content of 60%. Most of the ore outcrops on the ground and can be mined in the open air. Outcrops of coal seams can be seen on both sides of the highway from Zhangping to Longyan, and the reserves of anthracite are estimated to be around 600 million tons. However, in the high mountains and ridges, it was impossible to build factories for mining in the past, nor was it possible to transport the minerals out. The treasures could only sleep underground. The opening of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway brings a bright prospect for developing these underground treasures. The iron mine near Zhangping and an iron smelting plant with an annual output of 50,000 tons of pig iron will be put into production in the third quarter of this year. The surveying of the new 70-kilometer railway line from Zhangping to Longyan has already begun, and in the future, anthracite from western Fujian can supply the needs of industrial production and people's lives throughout the province.

Leaving the future mining area and heading north, passing through a dense primeval forest area, crossing the Daiyun Mountain watershed, the train gradually entered the territory of Yong'an County in the heart of Fujian Province. Yong'an was originally a remote small county surrounded by mountains. The timber reserves in the deep mountains and forests are 15 million cubic meters, and the bamboo forest covers 200,000 mu. In the primeval forest area, huge pine trees cannot be encircled by four people. Because of the abundance of trees and bamboo, it also produces nationally famous dried bamboo shoots, mushrooms, native paper, and rosin. The railway makes a large bend through here, and the highways centered on the railway station are accessible in all directions. The rivers have also been dredged, and mountain specialties are gathered from all directions. Now Yong'an has become a transportation hub connecting western Fujian, central Fujian, northern Fujian, and southern Fujian, and an important distribution center for goods. Four wholesale stations for general merchandise, textiles, etc., have been set up in the county seat. Some people say that it does half of Fujian's business. Since the northern section of the railway was opened to traffic in November last year, nearly 400 carloads of timber, more than 100 carloads of Mao bamboo, and 80 to 90 carloads of native paper and rosin have been transported out of Yong'an. Nearly 500 carloads of industrial products, daily necessities, and fertilizers have been transported in from other provinces. The backwardness of transportation has been fundamentally changed, and various mountain productions are developing vigorously like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. This year, Yong'an will cut 85,000 cubic meters of timber, more than double the amount of last year. Farmers can earn 640,000 yuan from mountain prices just from the cooperative logging part. It will also produce 1.4 million jin of dried bamboo shoots, 50,000 knives of native paper, and more than 20,000 jin of mushrooms. Since last year, seven factories for rosin, machinery, and hydropower have been built. The silent mountain area has become noisy.

Heading northeast from Yong'an, passing through large and small stations such as Sanyuan and Sha County, there is a bustling scene everywhere. One carload of goods has just been hauled away, and another follows closely behind, piling up like mountains. Nanping was originally a forestry city and a transportation hub for water and land in Fujian Province. It controls the vital points for Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces to go south, and has automobile access to the counties in northern Fujian. It is the confluence of the three major tributaries of the Min River upstream, the Shaxi, Jianxi, and Futunxi rivers, and the main stream of the Min River leads directly to Fuzhou downstream. Now the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway has a branch line to Nanping, and a new trunk line from Nanping to Fuzhou is under construction, making Nanping's position even more important. This year, 80% of the 2.8 million cubic meters of timber produced in Fujian Province will be transferred through Nanping. Although there are 40 to 50 freight cars carrying timber every day, the amount of timber piled up at the station does not decrease. Relevant departments are actively trying to improve transportation capacity. The forestry industry department is starting construction of a timber storage yard with an annual output of 600,000 cubic meters of timber on Dazhou Island near Nanping. In addition to the existing rosin factory and match factory, a newly built cement factory with a daily output of 200 tons and an expanded wood chemical factory have been put into production, and the large-scale Nanping Paper Mill is under construction.

The train travels along the winding Futunxi River in the mountains of northern Fujian. The distant mountains and nearby valleys along the Futunxi River are lush with towering trees. It is now the logging season, and the clanging sound of logging and the mountain songs of the loggers occasionally drift into the carriage. In the river, timber workers are driving log rafts downstream. According to surveys, there are more than 1,300 species of trees here. The chinquapin and oak used for shipbuilding, the Phoebe zhennan used for making exquisite instruments, the camphor used for making furniture, the Cyclobalanopsis glauca used for making spinning shuttles, and the Quercus variabilis needed for industry and national defense are all grown here. It only takes about 25 years for Chinese fir to grow into timber. There are countless things that can be utilized in the forest. The beautiful shell of the radio is made from wood chips and bamboo chips. The small pine branches that seem to be only good for burning as firewood can be made into pine soot, which is a valuable raw material for the rubber industry and electrical equipment. One dan of pine soot is worth 29 yuan, and the several counties along the Futunxi River alone will produce 138,000 dan this year. This area also abounds in tea, bamboo shoots, camellia oil, tung seeds, medicinal materials, and valuable animal skins such as tigers, leopards, muntjacs, and otters. Dozens of mineral deposits such as coal, iron, and fluorite are buried underground. In addition, the banks of the Futunxi River are also one of the important grain producing areas. Shaowu, the famous granary of Fujian, can transport more than 10 million jin of rice out every year. It can be said that gold is everywhere along the Futunxi River, and no one can say exactly how much wealth it has! It is equally difficult to say how much benefit the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway has brought to the people in the mountainous areas of northern Fujian. In Chenjiadian at the foot of Dahe Mountain on the border of Fujian and Jiangxi, men could not find wives in the past, because no one wanted to marry into this poor mountain village surrounded by towering mountains. In the past, one dan of rice could not be exchanged for four jin of salt, which was not worth three chi of cloth. Although mountain products were abundant, they were useless if they could not be sold! The railway passes through here, Mao bamboo sells for six jiao each, and a sleeper is worth seven yuan. Mountain products are worth money. The enthusiasm of the farmers for production has been greatly improved. In the past, large areas were burned for slash-and-burn agriculture, but now forest protection and fire prevention have been strengthened, and more than 400 mu of forest have been planted for the first time this year. More than 200 charcoal burners and comb makers came from Zhejiang and Jiangsu to settle down and produce locally, and the population has become prosperous. The train transports a large number of production and living materials, and the era of "sea salt being as expensive as gold" and "fire baskets as cotton jackets" is over. Within a year, the vast majority of the original poor peasants have lived a well-to-do middle peasant life. Such mountain villages are by no means isolated examples in the mountainous areas of northern Fujian.

The train left Tie Niu Guan, entered Jiangxi Province, and after a few dozen kilometers, arrived at Yingtan Station. The Yingtan-Xiamen Railway, which is 697.72 kilometers long, connects Fujian Province, which has the most difficult transportation in southeastern China, with the railway network of the motherland here.

People rightly call the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway the "Road to Happiness for the People of Fujian." In fact, it brings more than just happiness to the people of Fujian! Just look at the batches of valuable timber and local specialties transferred from Yingtan Station to various places, and you will know how much contribution the rich Fujian Province can make to the socialist construction of the motherland with this railway!

    福建人民的幸福之路

    火车从厦门车站开出，隆隆地驶过雄伟的海上长堤，美丽的厦门渐渐远去了。厦门，祖国东南的明珠，海防前哨的英雄堡垒，从此不再是海上孤岛，鹰厦铁路像一条强大的血管，把它和祖国的心脏地区联接起来，使它突然间增长了百倍力量，生机充沛，更加雄伟！
    沿着曲折的海湾西行，火车渐渐进入美丽富饶的九龙江平原。春光明媚，从车厢外望，平明如镜的大江两岸，连片的水田在阳光下像浮着一层油膏闪闪发亮，已经插下的早稻秧苗嫩绿可爱。与稻田相间，绿山障野，果树碧绿如海。以龙溪县为中心广袤四、五百方公里的这片平原，有人称它为“福建的乌克兰”，这里四季如春，土地肥沃，粮食作物一年可以三熟，去年，龙溪和海澄两县以获得水稻平均每亩产量千斤以上闻名全国；这里生长着三十多种奇花异果，甜美的荔枝、龙眼、柑、香蕉等年产七、八十万担，鲜果四季不断。科学家们认为这里可以发展包括橡胶、金鸡纳树、香茅草等三百多种亚热带作物。在这个得天独厚的地方，旧时代人们却充满悲惨的遭遇。由于日本帝国主义后来是美国帝国主义廉价的台湾香蕉和“花旗蜜桔”大量倾销，依靠果产生活的农民愤怒地把果树砍掉当柴烧。解放后在人民政府扶持下，果产虽逐年恢复发展，但是交通不便，一吨香蕉运到上海的运费比从广州运去贵三十四倍，大量水果只好在本地廉价销售，时常有积压霉烂。鹰厦路通车，痛心的年代结束了。今年龙溪专区根据这个新变化规划全面发展生产。龙溪县的各农、果业生产合作社社员们正热情地争取今年全县粮食平均单位面积产量达到一千二百二十五斤，还争取每户社员全年总产值折合一万斤粮食！
    火车跨过九龙江向西北进入华安和漳平境内。开阔的平原区逐渐不见了，代替它的是蜿蜒起伏的无数山峦。远处的山头不时可见三角红旗迎风招展，几个地质勘测队正在工作。这片地区是很有希望的矿区。不久以前，勘探队发现这里地下埋藏着丰富的铁、煤、铜、锰、铅、锌、耐火土、钼、石灰石等几十种矿藏。在漳平车站附近洛阳乡的一座磁铁矿，蕴藏量达二千万吨，含铁量达60％，矿苗大部分露出地面，可以露天开采，从漳平到龙岩的公路两侧可以看到露出地面的煤矿断层，估计无烟煤的蕴藏量在六亿吨左右。但是在高山峻岭之中，过去既无法设厂开采，也无法外运，宝藏只好在地下沉睡。鹰厦路通车带来开发地下宝藏的光辉前景。漳平附近的铁矿和一个年产五万吨生铁的炼铁厂，今年第三季度就可投入生产。漳平到龙岩七十多公里的铁路新线已经进行勘测，将来闽西的无烟煤可以供应全省工业生产和人民生活需要。
    离开未来的矿区北上，穿过遮天蔽日的原始森林地带，越过戴云山分水岭，渐渐进入福建省的腹地永安县境。永安原是群山环绕的偏僻小县份，深山丛林中木材蓄积量有一千五百万立方公尺，竹林有二十万亩。在原始林区，硕大的松树四个人围不拢来。由于树多竹多，还出产全国闻名的笋干、香菇、土纸和松香。铁路绕了一个大弯从这里经过，以火车站为中心的公路四通八达，河流也经过疏浚，山区土特产品从四面八方汇集而来。现在永安已经成为闽西、闽中和闽北、闽南交通联结的枢纽，重要的物资集散地。县城里设立了百货、纺织等四个批发站，有人说它做着半个福建的生意。从去年11月铁路北段通车以来，从永安运出近四百车皮木材，一百多车皮毛竹，土纸、松香等也运出八、九十车皮；从外省运进的工业品、日用百货和肥料也有近五百车皮。交通落后的面貌根本改变，山区各种生产如雨后春笋蓬勃发展。今年永安要砍伐八万五千立方公尺木材，比去年增加一倍多，光是合作社采伐部分，农民就可以收入山价六十四万元；还要生产一百四十万斤笋干，五万刀土纸和两万多斤香菇。从去年以来，兴建了松香、机器、水电等七个工厂。沉寂的山区喧闹起来了。
    从永安向东北去，沿途经过三元、沙县等大小车站，到处一片喧闹。一车车货物刚刚拖走，后面又接踵而来堆积成山。南平原来就是一个林业城市，又是福建省内水陆交通的枢纽。它控制着浙江、江西两省南下的要冲，和闽北各县有汽车可通；是闽江上游沙溪、建溪、富屯溪三大支流的总汇口，向下闽江干流直达福州。现在鹰厦铁路到南平有一条支线，从南平到福州的新干线正在修建，南平的地位更加重要了。今年福建省出产的二百八十万立方公尺的木材，80％要经由南平转运出去。每天虽然有四、五十节车皮载运木材，但是车站上的堆木总不见减少，有关部门正积极设法提高运输能力。森林工业部门在南平附近大洲岛正在动工兴建一座每年可产六十万立方公尺木材的贮木场。除了原有松香厂和火柴厂外，一座新建的日产二百吨的水泥厂和扩建的木材化工厂已经投入生产，规模巨大的南平造纸厂正在兴建中。
    火车在闽北山区傍着蜿蜒的富屯溪前进。富屯溪沿岸远山近谷一片蓊郁都是参天树木，现在正是伐木季节，叮叮的伐木声和伐木者的山歌不时飘进车厢来。在溪流中，运木工人驾驶着梢排顺流而下。根据调查材料，这里有一千三百多种树种，造船用的槠、栲，做精巧器械的楠木，制家具的樟木，制纺梭的青冈栎和工业、国防需要的栓皮栎等都有生长，杉木只要二十五年左右便可长大成材。森林里可以利用的东西真是多不胜数。美观的收音机的外壳是用木屑、竹屑加工制成的；看来只能当柴烧的细小松枝，可以制成松烟，是橡胶工业、电工器材的贵重原料，一担松烟价值二十九元，今年光富屯溪沿岸几个县就要生产十三万八千担。这里还盛产茶叶、笋、油茶、桐子、药材和虎豹、山麂、水獭等珍贵兽皮，地下埋藏着煤、铁、萤石等几十种矿藏。此外，富屯溪沿岸又是重要的粮产区之一，著名的福建谷仓邵武，每年有上千万斤大米可以外运。富屯溪沿岸可以说是黄金遍地，谁也说不清它到底有多少财富！要说清楚鹰厦铁路给闽北山区人民带来多少好处也同样是不容易的。在闽赣交界大禾山下陈家店，从前男人都讨不到老婆，因为谁也不愿意嫁到这个被崇山峻岭所围困的穷山村来。这里从前一担谷子换不到四斤盐，抵不上三尺布。山货虽然丰富，运销不出去还不是废物！铁路通过这里，一根毛竹卖六角，一根枕木值七元，山货样样值钱。农民们生产积极性大大提高，从前大片烧山，现在加强护林防火，今年还破天荒地造林四百多亩。远从浙江、江苏来了二百多名烧炭、制木梳工人，就地安家生产，人口兴旺起来。火车运来大批生产、生活资料，“海盐贵似金”、“火笼当棉袄”的年代结束了。一年之间，绝大多数原来的贫农过上富裕中农生活。这样的山村在闽北山区绝对不是仅有的例子。
    火车开出铁牛关，进入江西省境，再过去几十公里就到了鹰潭车站，全长六百九十七点七二公里的鹰厦铁路在这里把我国东南交通最困难的福建省和祖国内地的铁路网联接起来。
    人们正确地把鹰厦铁路称为“福建人民的幸福之路”，其实，它何止给福建人民带来幸福！只要看看从鹰潭车站向各地转运的成批的宝贵木材和土特产品，就会知道有了这条铁路，富饶的福建省对祖国的社会主义建设可以作出多大的贡献！
