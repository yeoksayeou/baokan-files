Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 31st – Xinhua News Agency reporters Gao Jie and Zhou Li reported: The majority of light industrial products in Shanghai closely related to people's daily lives have maintained or exceeded the production levels of the same period last year during the first quarter of this year. Despite having the fewest working days, the total output value of more than six thousand local light industrial factories is expected to reach over 24% of the annual plan.

Since the beginning of this year, many light industrial enterprises in Shanghai have persisted in production despite insufficient raw material supply. When arranging production, all industrial departments have prioritized finding every possible way to ensure the production of daily necessities. For enamelware industry, the national allocation of black iron sheets was less than half the required amount for the first quarter. Therefore, factories borrowed from relevant departments or other regions while focusing the limited raw materials on producing basins and mugs, which are needed by the people. Although the textile industry sector experienced production cuts this year due to insufficient raw cotton, the canvas and cotton fabrics supplied to rubber factories for making rubber shoes and tires increased compared to last year. In the first quarter, Shanghai's rubber shoe production exceeded that of the same period last year by more than 1.8 million pairs.

From the beginning of the year, the light industry sector has focused on organizing sources of goods and finding new raw materials. Since the beginning of this year, hundreds of people from factories under the two local light industry bureaus have frequently gone out to purchase raw materials. Shanghai purchasing personnel have been seen as far north as the Northeast and Inner Mongolia, and as far south as Guangzhou and Xiamen. Of the 46 million yuan in increased production and savings planned by the First Light Industry Bureau this year, more than one-third is to be achieved through increased production using self-procured raw materials. In the first quarter, approximately one-third of the raw materials used by the paper industry were obtained through the purchase of waste paper, rags, and hemp fibers from neighboring provinces and cities, enabling the paper industry, which faced an unprecedented shortage of raw materials, to produce an additional 1,000 tons of paper compared to the plan for the first quarter, exceeding the highest production level of the fourth quarter of last year.

The responsible bureaus and specialized companies have also reviewed the design specifications and quality of hundreds of major light industrial products. Without affecting quality, appropriate improvements have been made to some products that were previously excessively bulky and wasteful of materials, potentially saving large quantities of raw materials and increasing production. Drawing lessons from the decline in product quality caused by one-sided frugality in 1955, factories have adopted a more cautious approach when studying these measures. Products for which designs have been changed or are under consideration for change, such as badminton shuttlecocks, basketballs and volleyballs, mimeograph stencils, and veterinary metal injection needles, are first produced and sold in small quantities to gather feedback from commercial departments, user units, and consumers before being officially produced. Despite this, it has recently been discovered that a small number of factories are affecting quality due to one-sided frugality and rashly changing designs. The Municipal People's Committee and the responsible bureaus have taken note of this and are taking corrective action. Currently, the increased production and savings plans of each specialized company and factory have been preliminarily drafted and are being reviewed by soliciting opinions from commercial departments and user units, while also mobilizing the masses of workers to discuss them. Based on preliminary plans and production arrangements, Shanghai's total light industrial output value this year will not be lower than last year's level, and the planned output of paper, rubber shoes, tires, medicines, pen manufacturing, and sports and recreational supplies will exceed last year's output by 5% to 20%.

### 想尽办法保证原材料供应  上海轻工业保持或超过去年同期生产水平

    想尽办法保证原材料供应
    上海轻工业保持或超过去年同期生产水平
    新华社上海31日电　新华社记者高洁、周立报道：上海大部分和人民生活密切有关的轻工业品，今年第一季度都保持或超过了去年同时期的生产水平。工作日最少的第一季度，六千多个地方轻工业工厂的总产值预计可以达到年计划的24％以上。
    上海许多轻工业企业，今年以来都是在原材料供应不足的情况下坚持生产的。各工业部门在安排生产的时候，首先想一切办法保证生活日用品的生产。搪瓷工业需要的黑铁皮，一季度国家调拨的数量不足半数，各厂就一面向有关部门或外地借用，同时把有限的原料主要用来生产人们需要的面盆和口杯。纺织工业部门今年因为原棉不足生产有削减，可是供给橡胶厂做胶鞋、轮胎的帆布、棉毛布等都比去年增加，第一季度上海的胶鞋产量比去年同时期多一百八十多万双。
    从年初开始，轻工业部门就注意了组织货源和找寻新的原料。两个地方轻工业局所属各厂今年以来经常有好几百人外出采购原料。北到东北、内蒙古，南到广州、厦门都有上海采购人员的踪迹。第一轻工业局计划今年增产节约的四千六百万元中，有三分之一以上是要用自行采购的原料增产实现的。造纸工业第一季度大约三分之一的原料依靠收购邻省和市区的废纸、破布和麻绒进行生产，使原料空前缺少的造纸工业，第一季度比计划多生产了一千吨纸张，超过去年生产量最高的第四季度。
    各主管局和专业公司，还分别对几百种主要轻工业品的设计规格和质量进行审查。在不影响质量的原则下，把一些原来过分笨重用料浪费的产品适当加以改进，也可能节约出大批原料增加生产。各厂吸取1955年片面节约造成产品质量下降的教训，在研究这部分措施的时候，采取了比较慎重的态度。已经改变和正在考虑改变设计的产品，如羽毛球、篮排足球、誊写钢板、兽医用金属注射针等，都先经过小量试制试销，吸取商业部门、使用单位和消费者意见后，才正式生产。虽然如此，最近仍然发现有小部分工厂因为片面节约和轻率改变设计而影响到质量的现象，市人民委员会和主管局已经注意，并加以纠正。现在，各专业公司和厂的增产节约方案已经初步拟订，正在一面征求商业部门和使用单位意见，同时发动职工群众讨论。根据初步方案和生产安排情况看，上海今年轻工业总产值将不低于去年水平，纸张、胶鞋、轮胎、药品、制笔、体育文娱用品等的计划产量，都超过去年产量的5％到20％。
