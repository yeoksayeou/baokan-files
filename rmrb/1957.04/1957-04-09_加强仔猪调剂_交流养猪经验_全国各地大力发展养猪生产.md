Strengthen Piglet Allocation, Exchange Pig Raising Experience
All Parts of the Country Vigorously Develop Pig Production

    This newspaper reports that since the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the State Council issued the decision on developing pig production and raising the purchase price of live pigs, various regions are taking various measures to vigorously develop pig production. This year, the state's original pig raising plan was 110 million heads, but the plans of most provinces and cities exceed the state's target. Jinhua Prefecture in Zhejiang Province, known for its ham production, has determined that by the end of the year, the number of pigs in the region will reach 1.6 million to 1.8 million, an increase of 60%-80% compared to last year. Changde Prefecture in Hunan Province will raise 1.5 million pigs this year, double the number from last year. Wangcheng County in Hunan, famous for pig raising, originally planned to raise 530,000 pigs this year, but after the county's farmers learned about the Central Committee's decision, they requested expanding the plan to 740,000. Heilongjiang Province requires reaching 4 million heads by the end of this year, with an average of more than two pigs raised by each peasant household in the province. Hebei Province called on leaders at all levels to actively cultivate "every household raises pigs" cooperatives and "cooperatives with no sick pigs all year round" to ensure the completion of the province's plan to raise 6 million pigs this year, striving to reach 7 million.

    Large and medium-sized cities and industrial and mining areas are establishing pig production bases in the suburbs to ensure a normal supply of pork to the cities. Beijing Municipality and Hebei Province jointly decided to designate the suburbs of Beijing and 13 counties of Tongxian Prefecture in Hebei Province as the capital's pig production base, striving to basically meet the meat needs of the people of the capital within a few years. The CPC Harbin Municipal Committee decided to place suburban pig production in the primary position of suburban work and established a pig production leading committee to lead this work.

    Various institutions, military units, and other collective catering units are also universally using swill and other materials for pig raising. The People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Lanzhou slaughtered 350,000 jin of meat last year and decided to raise pigs to slaughter 530,000 jin of meat this year. The Hainan Island garrison proposed the target of raising one pig for every ten people. The various units of the Fujian Front actively increased pig raising, and according to the plan, this year's meat supply can be 50% self-sufficient.

    In the development of pig production, many places have strengthened the allocation and supply of piglets. Agricultural cooperatives in various regions are also widely conducting technical exchanges and learning advanced pig raising experience.

    Because we are currently in the early stages of developing pig production, a large portion of the existing pig population in various regions must be reserved as boars and sows for expanded breeding, which relatively reduces the proportion of fattened pigs leaving the pens. At the same time, many of the piglets kept in the pens at the end of last year will not be raised into fattened pigs until the second half of the year. Therefore, it is expected that pork supplies in various regions this year, especially in the first half of the year, will not increase rapidly. (Zhou Chongguang, Chen Decong)

    加强仔猪调剂　交流养猪经验
    全国各地大力发展养猪生产
    本报讯　自从中共中央、国务院发出关于发展养猪生产的决定和提高生猪收购价格以后，各地正在采取各种措施大力发展养猪生产。今年，国家原定的养猪计划是一亿一千万头，而各省、市的计划大都超过了国家的计划指标。以生产火腿著称的浙江省金华专区，确定到年底全区生猪发展到一百六十万到一百八十万头，比去年增加60％—80％；湖南省常德专区，今年饲养的生猪要达到一百五十万头，比去年增加一倍；以养猪闻名的湖南望城县，原来确定今年养猪五十三万头，但当全县农民知道了中央的决定后，要求扩大计划为七十四万头。黑龙江省到今年年底要求达到四百万头，全省平均每户农民将养猪二头以上。河北省号召各级领导积极培养“户户养猪社”和“全年无病猪社”来保证完成今年全省养猪六百万头，争取达到七百万头的计划。
    各大、中城市和工矿区，正在郊区建立生猪生产基地，保证城市猪肉正常供应。北京市和河北省共同研究决定把北京郊区和河北省的通县专区十三个县划为首都的生猪生产基地，争取在三几年内基本上可以满足首都人民的肉食需要；中共哈尔滨市委决定把郊区生猪生产放在郊区工作的首要地位，并成立了生猪生产领导委员会来领导这个工作。
    各地机关、部队等集体伙食单位也普遍利用泔水等进行养猪。解放军驻兰州的部队去年杀肉三十五万斤，今年决定养猪杀肉五十三万斤。海南岛驻军提出每十个人养一头猪的指标。福建前线各部队积极增养生猪，按照计划今年的肉食可以50％自给。
    在发展生猪生产中，很多地方加强了仔猪的调剂和供应工作。各地农业社还广泛的进行技术交流，学习先进的养猪经验。
    由于当前正处在发展养猪生产的初期，各地现有的猪群中要有很大一部分猪被留为种公猪和种母猪，用以扩大繁殖，这就相对的减少了肥猪出圈比例，同时，去年年末圈存仔猪有不少一部分要在下半年才能育成肥猪，因此在今年，特别是上半年各地的猪肉供应，预计还不会很快的增多。　（周崇光、陈德聪）
