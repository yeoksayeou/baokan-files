Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 18th (Reporter Chen Zheng) The butterfly gathering by Erhai Lake has begun again. On the 16th, I accompanied some Soviet experts from the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Yunnan Biological Expedition to visit Butterfly Spring, the place where butterflies gather annually.

About twenty kilometers east of Dali City, at the foot of Cangshan Mountain by Erhai Lake, there is a lush and tranquil grove. In the grove is a clear spring of water, over which dense branches and leaves are draped. On these leaves, which resemble a swarm of green butterflies, are gathered all kinds of colorful butterflies. One clings to another, spreading their wings, hanging in strings from the branches to the surface of the water, dreaming sweet spring dreams in the gentle breeze. Suddenly, a butterfly hanging close to the water's surface touched the spring water and startled, causing the entire string of butterflies to fly upwards, like a basket of flowers scattered in the air.

Why do these beautiful butterflies gather here when azaleas are blooming everywhere? The local Bai people told the reporter a folk legend: A diligent and beautiful girl refused to marry the tyrant who ruled Cangshan and Erhai. Under the tyrant's coercion, she and her beloved young woodcutter embraced and jumped into the "Bottomless Pool." After their death, the bottom of the pool cracked open, and a pair of magnificent butterflies flew out of the hole, chasing each other and dancing gracefully by the pool. Various butterflies flew from all directions towards this pair of butterflies. From then on, this pool was renamed "Butterfly Spring."

Soviet scale insect expert P. Borchsenius and insect ecologist V.A. Mench decided to visit Butterfly Spring and conduct preliminary observations of these butterflies, the leaves they like to stay on, and the surrounding environment with great interest. They believe there are two possible reasons why butterflies gather only at Butterfly Spring. Borchsenius believes that these butterflies may lay their eggs on the tree where the butterflies gather, passing on from generation to generation. He said that in the past, there may have been many trees and many butterflies here, but later local farmers reclaimed land and cut down the trees, leaving only this old tree, and therefore only the butterfly eggs on this tree remained. Insect ecologist Mench climbed up the trunk to carefully examine the branches and leaves. He believes that these butterflies may come from the surrounding fields and grasslands. He said that this old tree is a camphor tree, and the fragrance it emits is likely the reason why these butterflies with sensitive olfactory senses fly from afar. Some people worry that the number of butterflies will decrease year by year. Borchsenius believes that as long as the spring water and grove here are not destroyed, that is, the natural living environment of the butterflies is not changed, this "Butterfly Spring" scenic spot may still exist for a considerable period of time.

The experts also collected several butterflies from "Butterfly Spring" as specimens, intending to take them back to their country for identification.

### 蝴蝶相会洱海边  专家访问蝴蝶泉

    蝴蝶相会洱海边
    专家访问蝴蝶泉
    新华社昆明18日电　新华社记者陈铮报道，洱海边的蝶会又开始了。记者在16日随同中国科学院云南生物考察队的部分苏联专家，访问了蝴蝶们一年一度相会的地方——蝴蝶泉。
    离大理城东约二十公里的洱海边的苍山脚下，有一片翠绿的幽静的树丛，树丛中有一潭清澈的水泉，在泉顶上空斜复有密茂的枝叶。就在这些形态像一群绿蝶的叶子上面，聚满了各种各样的彩色缤纷的蝴蝶，一只衔着一只，舒展双翼，成串地从枝叶上垂挂到水面，在微风轻拂中做着春日美妙的梦。忽然，一只垂近水面的蝴蝶，碰到了泉水一惊而起，使整串的蝴蝶一齐向上空飞起，像撒在空中的一篮花朵。
    为什么在这满山杜鹃处处红的时候，美丽的蝴蝶都要来这里相聚呢？当地的白族人民告诉记者一个民间流传着的神话故事：一个勤劳美丽的姑娘不愿嫁给统治苍山和洱海的恶霸，在恶霸的威逼下，她和她心爱的青年樵夫拥抱着跳进了“无底潭”。他们死后，潭底裂开一个水洞，从洞中飞出了一对绚丽的蝴蝶，互相追逐，在潭边翩翩飞舞，各种蝴蝶也从四面八方向这一对蝴蝶飞来。从此，这个水潭改名叫“蝴蝶泉”。
    苏联介壳虫专家鲍尔赫西尼乌斯与昆虫生态学家孟恰茨基来到蝴蝶泉后，以极大的兴趣初步观察了这些蝴蝶和蝴蝶喜爱停留的枝叶、周围的环境。他们认为，吸引蝴蝶只在蝴蝶泉一地集中的原因有两种可能。鲍尔赫西尼乌斯认为：这些蝴蝶可能就是在那株聚着蝴蝶的树上产卵，一代代传下去的。他说，过去在这里可能有很多的树和很多的蝴蝶，后来当地农民开垦土地，把树砍光了，只留下了这株老树，因此也只剩下了这树上的这些蝶卵。昆虫生态学家孟恰茨基爬到树干上去仔细察看了枝叶。他认为，这些蝴蝶可能是来自四周的田野和草地。他说，这株老树是樟脑属的树木，它散发出来的芳香，很可能是使这些嗅觉灵敏的蝴蝶从远处飞来的原因。有人耽心蝴蝶会逐年减少。鲍尔赫西尼乌斯认为，只要这里的泉水和树丛不被破坏，即蝴蝶的自然生活环境不被改变，这个“蝴蝶泉”名胜可能还会存在相当长的一个时期。
    专家们还在“蝴蝶泉”采集了几只蝴蝶作标本，准备带回国去进行鉴定。
