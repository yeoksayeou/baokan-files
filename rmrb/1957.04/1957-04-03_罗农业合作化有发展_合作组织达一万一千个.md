Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 2nd. The number of various agricultural cooperative organizations in Romania has increased from more than 6,300 at the end of 1955 to 11,000 at the end of February this year. That is to say, the number of various agricultural cooperative organizations established in the past year and two months is almost equivalent to the total number of various cooperative organizations built in the six years since the beginning of agricultural socialist transformation. The land owned by cooperative organizations has also increased from more than 1.3 million hectares at the end of 1955 to more than 2 million hectares at the end of February this year.

In the first two months of this year, the speed of agricultural socialist transformation was even more significant. Many places have achieved cooperativization of entire counties and entire townships. Before December last year, there were only two cooperativized counties in the country, but currently there are ten cooperativized counties. In the first two months of this year, Bucharest Oblast established two collective farms and 130 agricultural mutual aid teams, and 100 townships in the entire Oblast have been cooperativized. In the past two months, more than 500 peasant households in Craiova Oblast have joined collective farms, more than 50 peasant households have participated in agricultural production cooperatives, and nearly 400 agricultural mutual aid teams have also been established. The cooperativization movement in Timisoara Oblast has always progressed very slowly. In the past, there was not a single cooperativized township, but this year more than 40 townships have been cooperativized.

The rapid development of the socialist transformation movement of agriculture in Romania in recent years is inseparable from the Workers' Party mobilizing cadres at all levels to strengthen political propaganda and organizational work among the peasants. In addition, the Workers' Party Central Committee's decision in December last year to abolish the agricultural product purchase system also had an important impact.

    罗农业合作化有发展
    合作组织达一万一千个
    新华社布加勒斯特2日电　罗马尼亚各种农业合作组织的数目已经从1955年底的六千三百多个增加到今年2月底的一万一千个，也就是说，在最近一年另两个月的时间中所建立的各种农业合作组织的数目，几乎相当于开始农业社会主义改造以来六年中所建各种合作组织的总和。合作组织所拥有的土地也已经从1955年底的一百三十多万公顷增加到今年2月底的二百多万公顷。
    在今年头两个月中，农业社会主义改造的速度更是显著。许多地方整县、整乡合作化了。去年12月以前，全国只有两个合作化的县，而目前已有十个县合作化了。布加勒斯特州今年头两个月建立了两个集体农庄和一百三十个农业联合耕种社，全州已经有一百个乡合作化了。在最近两个月内，在克拉约发州有五百多户农民加入集体农庄，有五十多户农民参加农业生产合作社，另外还建立了近四百个农业联合耕种社。底密索拉州的合作化运动一向进展很慢，过去没有一个合作化的乡，今年已有四十多个乡合作化了。
    罗马尼亚农业社会主义改造运动近年来获得如此迅速的发展是和工人党动员各级干部在农民中加强政治宣传和组织工作分不开的。此外，工人党去年12月中央全会决定取消农产品征购制也有重要的影响。
