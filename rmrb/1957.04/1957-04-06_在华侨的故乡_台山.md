    In the Hometown of Overseas Chinese—Taishan
    Han Meng
    In the season when lychee flowers bloom, I visited Taishan, the hometown of American Overseas Chinese.
    Taishan is a coastal county in Guangdong Province. With its mountainous terrain and barren land, it has been a place where people struggled to make a living since ancient times. From the Jiaqing and Daoguang periods of the Qing Dynasty, the poor farmers here went to the Americas one after another, responding to recruitment from various American countries, leaving their homes and serving as "coolies" to reclaim wasteland. After the various countries in the Americas prohibited the entry of Chinese laborers in the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China, later arrivals turned to various Southeast Asian countries. According to incomplete statistics, there are approximately 150,000 overseas Chinese from Taishan, distributed in forty to fifty countries, with the largest number in the Americas. Therefore, people have always regarded Taishan as the hometown of American Overseas Chinese.
    From the county seat to the villages and towns, Taishan is full of small foreign-style buildings, and the roads extend in all directions. These show the boundless love of the Overseas Chinese from Taishan for their hometown.
    But this time I came to Taishan to explore newer things.
    Returned Overseas Chinese Elected as Deputy County Head
    The first person I visited was Comrade Chen Houfu, Deputy County Head and a returned Overseas Chinese.
    On a spring night, Deputy County Head Chen received me at his residence in the County People's Committee. He is a 57-year-old veteran who lived in the United States for thirty years, from 1922 to 1951. More than thirty years ago, he went to the United States as a primary school teacher who had graduated from an old-style middle school, harboring the illusion of "earning some money to support a group of younger siblings." When he arrived in New York, he worked as a laundry worker in a fellow townsman's laundry. A year later, in order to earn more money, he went to a Chinese restaurant in Philadelphia to work as a waiter serving dishes. There, inspired by the revolutionary fervor of the Northern Expedition, he joined the Kuomintang and took charge of propaganda work. Soon, Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution, and he and many people with a sense of justice withdrew from the Kuomintang and formed the Anti-Imperialist League, determined to oppose imperialism to the end. Subsequently, he supported unity against Japan, organized an anti-Japanese association to raise funds for the war of resistance, opposed surrender, and opposed the Kuomintang reactionaries' launching of a full-scale civil war. He and his friends repeatedly sent telegrams to carry out fierce struggles against the reactionaries. On October 1, 1949, they raised the first five-star red flag in New York. When his hometown was liberated, he sent a telegram to congratulate them, requesting the People's Government to improve public security, prohibit opium and gambling, and lead construction.
    Looking at Deputy County Head Chen's slightly gray hair, I savored a passage he said: "Not long after the failure of the Northern Expedition, I returned to China once to visit my family. I originally planned to stay for a year, but who knew that when I returned to my hometown, the public security was so bad that I was worried day and night that thieves would come to kidnap and rob, and I secretly ran away after only a few months of living in fear!" What about after the liberation of the motherland? As soon as he returned to China, the people's county head, upon hearing the news, sent a representative to Sanbu Town outside the county to greet him. And now? He is the repeatedly elected Deputy County Head, participating in the leadership of a county!
    When I said goodbye and came out, I couldn't help but think: Isn't the experience of a Deputy County Head a testament to the path of patriotic Overseas Chinese, and a testament to the status of Overseas Chinese in the new motherland!
    Government Committee Member Huang Shuzhen
    Huang Shuzhen is a 47-year-old ordinary woman. Her father, father-in-law, and husband are all Overseas Chinese. She has relied on remittances from Overseas Chinese to live a relatively wealthy life since she was a child. Now, she actively participates in labor and has been elected as a county-level and provincial-level agricultural labor model.
    In the autumn of 1954, three mutual aid teams in the village built a primary agricultural cooperative and invited her, an Overseas Chinese relative who was assessed as a middle peasant during the land reform, to join the cooperative. She saw that after the mutual aid team was organized, production was indeed doing well. Seeing that many peasants had joined the cooperative, she worried that no one would help her with work in the future. She also heard that joining the cooperative and doing a good job in agricultural production could support industrial construction. So, she brought two mu of paddy fields and one mu of dry land to join the cooperative.
    After joining the primary cooperative, she was immediately elected as a member of the cooperative's management committee and was sent to a cooperative training class to study. During her studies, she listened to reports, visited the Nanqiao Agricultural Cooperative in the county, and met the famous labor model Li Qiubai. She understood the importance of running an agricultural cooperative well, and also understood that cooperative members had the obligation to invest in the cooperative. When she returned, she took the lead in investing sixty yuan, prompting other cooperative members to follow suit, which solved the first difficulty in production after the establishment of the cooperative. That year, she learned how to transplant rice seedlings, harvest rice, hoe field ridges, and operate waterwheels. That year, the labor remuneration she received, plus land dividends, not only exchanged for sufficient personal grain (her only daughter was studying at a university in Guangzhou), but also received twenty yuan in cash. That year, she was named the county's second-class agricultural labor model and the district's model Overseas Chinese relative.
    With a more stable life and glory brought by labor, Huang Shuzhen further recognized her own path. When the high tide of agricultural cooperation arrived, she joined the advanced cooperative without hesitation, and also used her own experience to mobilize many Overseas Chinese relatives and poor peasants to join the cooperative.
    Last year, in the advanced cooperative, she was still elected as a member of the cooperative's management committee and also worked as a work-point recorder (she had studied for four years). She was more active in labor production. After completing the work assigned to her by the cooperative ahead of schedule, she went to help other Overseas Chinese relatives and female cooperative members with weak labor power. When the cooperative encountered a drought unprecedented in decades, she participated in the heavy work of digging wells and operating waterwheels. One night, she and several female cooperative members returned after completing the task of digging a well. On the way, they found that there was no water in the cooperative's paddy fields, so she led those female cooperative members to automatically operate the waterwheel, cart after cart until dawn. She also led the cooperative members to fertilize and weed in time despite being ill, so that the production team she was in continued to increase production. That year, although the land remuneration was abolished, her income still increased by ten yuan in cash and a large amount of miscellaneous grains compared to the previous year. That year, she was recommended by the Overseas Chinese relatives in the county to attend the Guangdong Provincial Overseas Chinese Relatives Production Conference, and was also named the county's special-class agricultural labor model and the Guangdong Provincial first-class agricultural labor model. That year, she was elected as a representative of the township and county people's congress, deputy township head, and member of the county people's committee.
    Huang Shuzhen excitedly told me about her experience, and also showed me a letter recently sent by her father-in-law, who was far away abroad. Her father-in-law heard these good news and praised her as a "heroine among women."
    "What hero, I just did what an Overseas Chinese relative should do!" she said modestly.
    The Harvest of the "Overseas Chinese Cooperative"
    I also visited the Southeast Agricultural Cooperative in Guanghai Township. Among the 47 cooperative members in this cooperative, 79% are Overseas Chinese relatives, and it was established under the leadership of cooperative director Liu Huanxiang (a returned Overseas Chinese from Burma) and others. After the establishment of the cooperative, it received strong support from Overseas Chinese, so in Taishan County, it is known as the "Overseas Chinese Cooperative."
    Originally, when the high tide of cooperation arrived, the township branch still believed that there were many Overseas Chinese relatives in this Southeast Village, the labor force was weak, and many people did not have the habit of labor, so they planned to set up the cooperative a little later. However, the Overseas Chinese relatives were unwilling to lag behind and requested to set up the cooperative. After the primary cooperative was established, many people worried that they would collapse. However, the Overseas Chinese relatives were very competitive. All 33 male laborers and 39 female laborers in the cooperative worked together, insisting on fighting drought and implementing technical reforms, etc. Each laborer cultivated an average of four mu of land, cultivating it in an orderly manner. At the end of the year, they calculated that they had increased production by 663 dan of rice, which is an increase of 52%.
    The cooperative increased production, and the cooperative members became rich. Except for one poor peasant household where the labor force was chronically ill and did not increase income, the income of all other households increased. For example, the single Overseas Chinese relative Huang Qilan cultivated more than one mu of land by herself before joining the cooperative, and the harvested grain was only enough for two months of food. In the first year of joining the cooperative, she worked 192 workdays, and with the land dividends, she received more than seven dan of grain, which was enough for food, and also received more than seventy yuan in cash. The elderly Overseas Chinese women and Xi's mother, who were unable to work, were also given sufficient grain according to the land remuneration for joining the cooperative.
    This year, the Southeast Cooperative has become an advanced cooperative. They plan to increase grain production by 8% and also develop sideline occupations—raising pigs, raising chickens, and fishing. The cooperative members are full of confidence and want to increase the remuneration for each workday from seven jiao last year to one yuan and two jiao and four fen this year.
    The victory won by the Southeast Cooperative in production has encouraged more than 100 Overseas Chinese far away overseas. Not long after the establishment of the cooperative last year, they voluntarily donated more than 500 yuan to support it, and designated it for the establishment of a club and the development of chicken-raising sideline occupations. The Overseas Chinese relatives and returned Overseas Chinese in the cooperative are also enthusiastic in supporting the cooperative's production. Overseas Chinese relatives Liu Huanxiang, Liu Ningfu, etc. sent four five-step plows. Liu Xiye, a 77-year-old American returned Overseas Chinese, personally buys several hundred yuan of fertilizer for investment every year. I asked him why he did this, and he said with a smile:
    "I invest cash. If someone holds the money down and doesn't buy fertilizer quickly, then they won't be able to buy fertilizer in the future, and that would be terrible! I buy the fertilizer first and pile it up at home. When the cooperative needs fertilizer, I invest it. Isn't that the safest way!"
    Look, this old man who worked as a laundry worker in Canada and the United States for thirty years is so passionate about the agricultural cooperative!

    在华侨的故乡—台山
    韩萌
    荔枝花开的时节，我访问了美洲华侨的故乡——台山。
    台山，是广东省的一个滨海县份，境内山多地瘠，自古以来是个民不聊生的地方。从清嘉庆、道光年间，这里的贫苦农民就纷纷应美洲各国的招募，离乡背井到美洲充当垦荒的“苦力”去了。清末民初，美洲各国禁止华工入境以后，后来者才转而到南洋各国。据不完全的统计，台山现有旅外华侨十五万左右，他们分布在四、五十个国家，其中在美洲的占最大多数，因而人们向来都把台山看成是美洲华侨的故乡。
    台山从县城到村镇，到处都有小型的洋楼，公路四通八达，这些，显示了台山华侨对家乡的无限热爱。
    但我这次到台山，却是为了探访更新的事物。
    归侨连任副县长
    我访问的第一个对象，是副县长、归侨陈厚父同志。
    春夜，陈副县长在县人民委员会他的住房里接待了我。他是个五十七岁的老前辈，从1922年至1951年，他曾在美国侨居了三十年。三十多年前，他作为一个旧制中学毕了业的小学教师，怀着“赚些钱来培植一群弟妹”的幻梦到美国去了。到了纽约，他去同乡的洗衣馆里当洗衣工人；一年以后，为了多赚些钱，他又到费城的中国餐馆去当端菜的侍役。在那里，他受了北伐革命热潮的鼓舞，参加了国民党，主持宣传工作。不久，蒋介石叛变了革命，他和许多有正义感的人退出了国民党，合组了反帝大同盟，决心反帝到底。随后，他拥护团结抗日，组织抗日会募集抗日款，他反对投降，反对国民党反动派发动全面内战，曾和朋友们一次次发出通电，向反动派进行激烈的斗争。1949年10月1日，他们在纽约升起了第一面五星红旗。家乡解放，他致电祝贺，要求人民政府把治安搞好，禁烟禁赌，领导建设。
    我望着陈副县长那有点灰白的头发，回味着他讲的一段话：“北伐失败不久，我曾回国省亲一次。本来打算住一年的，谁料回到家乡，治安太坏，日夜担心盗贼来绑票、抢劫，提心吊胆地只住了几个月，就偷偷跑了！”祖国解放以后呢？他一回国，人民的县长闻知，即派代表到县外的三埠镇去迎接。现在呢？他是被连选连任的副县长，参加一个县的领导工作！
    我辞别出来，不禁想道：一个副县长的经历，不正是说明了爱国华侨的道路，说明了华侨在新生祖国的地位么！
    政府委员黄淑贞
    黄淑贞是一个四十七岁的普通妇女。她的父亲、家翁、丈夫都是华侨，她从小就依靠侨汇过着相当富裕的生活；现在，她积极参加劳动，当选为县里、省里的农业劳动模范。
    1954年秋天，村里三个互助组合建一个初级农业社，来邀她这个在土地改革中被评做中农的侨眷入社。她看到互助组组织起来以后，生产的确搞得好；又见许多农民入了社，担心将来再没人帮她做工；又听说入了社，把农业生产搞好，可支援工业建设，于是，她带着两亩水田和一亩旱田入社了。
    加入了初级社，她立即被选为社务委员会委员，并且被派到办社训练班去学习。在学习时，她听了报告，又参观了县里的南乔农业社和会见了著名劳动模范李球柏，明白了办好农业社的重要性，也明白了社员有向社投资的义务。回来，她带头投资六十元，推动了其他社员也跟着投资，解决了建社后生产上的第一道难关。这一年，她学会了插秧、割禾、锄田基、车水等工作。这一年，她得到的劳动报酬，加上土地分红，除换回了个人充足的粮食外（她仅有的一个女儿在广州念大学），还分到现款二十块钱。这一年，她被评为县的农业二等劳动模范、区的模范侨眷。
    生活更加安定，劳动带来光荣，黄淑贞更认清自己的道路；当农业合作化高潮到来时，她毫不犹豫地加入了高级社，还现身说法，动员了不少侨眷和贫苦农民入了社。
    去年，在高级社里，她仍当选为社务委员，还兼记工员（她念过四年书）。她对劳动生产更积极了，她提前完成社分配给她的工作后，又去帮助其他侨眷和劳动力弱的女社员。社里遇到了几十年所罕见的大旱灾，她参加打井和车水的沉重工作。有一夜，她和几个女社员完成了打井的任务回来，路上发现社的水田没有水，她就带动那几个女社员自动去车水，一车车到天亮。她还曾抱病带动社员及时施肥、除草，使她所在的那个生产小组不断增产。这一年，虽然取消了土地报酬，她的收入还比前一年增加了十元现款和大批杂粮。这一年，她被县里的侨眷推选为代表去出席广东省侨眷生产会议，还被评为县农业特等劳动模范，广东省农业一等劳动模范。这一年，她被选为乡、县人民代表、副乡长、县人民委员会委员。
    黄淑贞兴奋地给我讲述她的经历，还拿出她那个远在国外的家翁最近寄来的信给我看。她的家翁听到这些喜讯，赞许她是“女中英雄”。
    “什么英雄，我只做了一个侨眷应做的事嘛！”她谦虚地说。
    “华侨社”的丰收
    我还访问了广海乡东南农业社。这个社的四十七户社员中，有79％是侨眷，而且是由社主任刘焕祥（缅甸侨眷）等带动办起来的，建社后又获得海外华侨的大力支持，所以，在台山县里，它有“华侨社”之称。
    本来，当合作化高潮到来时，乡支部还认为这东南村的侨眷多，劳动力弱，很多人没有劳动习惯，打算慢一点来办社。可是，侨眷们却不甘落后，来请求办社了。建起了初级社，很多人担心他们会垮台，可是，侨眷们很争气，全社三十三个男劳动力和三十九个女劳动力合将起来，坚持抗旱、实行技术改革等等，每个劳动力平均耕种四亩田地，耕种得有条有理。到年底一算，他们竟增产了六百六十三担谷子，即增产了52％。
    社增产，社员富裕了。全社除一户贫农因为劳动力长年病倒没有增加收入以外，其余各户的收入都增加了。如单身侨眷黄绮兰，入社前一人自耕一亩多田，收获的粮食只够两个月的口粮；入社第一年，她一人做了一百九十二个劳动日，加上土地分红，分到足够的口粮七担多谷，还收到现款七十多元。年老侨妇和希母，不能劳动，社里也按入社土地报酬，分给她足够的口粮。
    今年，东南社已经成为高级社了。他们计划增产粮食8％，还要发展副业——养猪、养鸡、捕鱼。社员们人人充满信心，要把每个劳动日的报酬，由去年的七角提高到今年的一元二角四分。
    东南社在生产上打的胜仗，鼓舞了远处海外的一百多位华侨。去年建社不久，他们就自动捐了五百多元来支援，并指定作为建立俱乐部和发展养鸡副业之用。社内的侨眷和归侨，也都热心支持社的生产。侨眷刘焕祥、刘宁夫等送了四架五一步犁；七十七岁的美国归侨刘希业，每年都亲自买好几百元的肥料投资。我问他为什么这样做法，他笑嘻嘻地说：
    “我投现金，如果有人把钱压住，不赶快买肥料，将来买不到肥料，那就糟了！我先买好肥料堆在家里，等到社要用肥料，我就投，那不是最稳当的嘛！”
    你看，这个在加拿大和美国当了三十年洗衣工人的老人，是这样热爱农业社的！
