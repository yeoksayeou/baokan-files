    During the Holiday
　　Han Xiao
    During the holiday,
    The General walks into the barracks.
    The soldiers have all gone to play,
    Only in front of the window where peach blossoms bloom,
    Sits a new recruit.
    He faces the flowered stationery,
    His pen stops and starts again…
    Has the photo been received?
    Yesterday when we were shooting targets,
    The chief gave me…
    The General stands behind him,
    Squinting his kind eyes,
    Unable to resist urging him:
    Write quickly!…
    Put a red flower on me,
    If you can't write it, draw one instead!
    The new recruit thought it was a fellow townsman,
    Without even turning his head, he said:
    Sigh! I have a bellyful of things to say but can't express myself clearly!
    The General burst into laughter,
    Scaring the new recruit, his face flushed.
    He stood up and reported loudly:
    Comrade General! I am… I am practicing writing!
    The General patted him on the shoulder and said:
    Good! I wish you get a five!
    Your writing is full of emotion!

    在假日里
　　韩笑
    在假日里，
    将军走进兵营。
    战士们都游戏去啦，
    只有桃花盛开的窗前，
    坐着一个新兵。
    他对着带花的信纸，
    钢笔停了又停……
    照片收到了没有？
    昨天我们打靶，
    首长又给我……
    将军站在背后，
    眯着慈祥的眼睛，
    忍不住催他：
    快写吗！……
    给我戴上红花，
    若是不会写，画一个也行！
    新兵以为是同乡，
    连头也没回就说：
    咳！一肚子话呀就是讲不清！
    将军听了大笑起来，
    吓得新兵满面绯红。
    他立起大声报告：
    将军同志！我正……正练习作文！
    将军拍着他肩膀说：
    好！祝你得个五分！
    你的文章很有感情！
