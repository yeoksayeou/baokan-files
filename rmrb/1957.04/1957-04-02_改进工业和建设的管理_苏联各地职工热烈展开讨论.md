Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 1st: Khrushchev's draft report "On Further Improving the Organization of Management of Industry and Construction," published on March 30, has become the focus of widespread attention among the working people throughout the Soviet Union. Industrial enterprises and construction sites across the country have already launched discussions on this report. Initial reactions indicate that workers nationwide wholeheartedly approve of the measures to improve the leadership methods for industry and construction, as well as the decision of the CPSU Central Committee and the Soviet Council of Ministers to publish Khrushchev's draft report for nationwide discussion.

During the organized discussions that have unfolded across the country, workers have drawn on their own experiences to talk about the correctness of the measures proposed in Khrushchev's report. Miners in the Donbas coal region pointed out that coal is produced in the work sections, but above the work sections there are mine management offices, trusts, general administrations, and above them are the coal industry ministries of the republic and the all-union coal industry ministry. As a result, a large number of experts are concentrated in the offices of the overlapping management structures, while the technical leadership at the work section level is very weak. Workers at the "Red" Excavator Factory in Kiev, the capital of the Ukrainian Republic, pointed out that the factory currently needs to produce many small parts itself, which causes a great deal of waste. If specialized enterprises could be established according to economic regions, as the Party and the government are preparing to implement, then all the small parts needed by industrial enterprises throughout Kiev could be produced in a centralized manner.

    改进工业和建设的管理
    苏联各地职工热烈展开讨论
    据新华社莫斯科1日电　3月30日发表的赫鲁晓夫的“关于进一步改进管理工业和建设的组织工作”的报告提纲，已经成为苏联全国劳动人民广泛注意的中心。各地工业企业和建设工地已经展开了对这一报告的讨论。初步的反应表明，全国职工都衷心赞成改进对工业和建设的领导方法以及苏共中央和苏联部长会议决定公布赫鲁晓夫的报告提纲以便让全民讨论的措施。
    在各地展开的有组织的讨论中，工人们都根据自己的经验谈到赫鲁晓夫的报告中提出的措施的正确性。顿巴斯煤区的矿工指出，煤是在工段上生产的，可是，工段之上设有矿井管理处、托辣斯、管理总局，再上面还有共和国采煤工业部和全联盟的采煤工业部。这一来，大量的专家都集中在层层叠叠的管理机构的办公室里，而工段上的技术领导反而很弱。乌克兰共和国首都基辅的“红色”掘土机工厂的工人指出，这个工厂目前需要自己生产许多小零件，这造成了很大的浪费。如果能像党和政府准备实行的按照经济区域建立专业化企业，那么全基辅的工业企业所需要的这些小零件就都可以集中起来生产。
