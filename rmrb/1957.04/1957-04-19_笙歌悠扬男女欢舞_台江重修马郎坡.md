Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 18th — In Pianzhai Township, Taijiang County, Southeast Guizhou Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, Matai Slope, which had been barren for sixteen years, once again resonated with melodious reed pipes on the 15th. On the newly green grass, Miao youths danced the Lusheng dance, joyfully celebrating this year's "March Festival."

Playing on Matai Slope is a basic form of courtship activity for Miao youths. Near the villages inhabited by the Miao people, in places with beautiful scenery, there are Matai Slopes. After liberation, due to insufficient consideration of the Miao customs and habits, many Matai Slopes were turned into farmland. Last year, after Taijiang County inspected the implementation of ethnic policies, it immediately corrected this. To date, 199 Matai Slopes have been restored. For the few places that had become farmland and could not be restored, suitable locations were transferred and reopened after consultation with the local youth leaders, "Matai Heads" and "Girl Heads." The Communist Youth League organizations at all levels have also begun to lead Miao youths in beautifying the Matai Slopes.

    笙歌悠扬男女欢舞
    台江重修马郎坡
    新华社贵阳18日电　黔东南苗族侗族自治州台江县偏寨乡一座荒芜了十六年的马郎坡，十五日重新笙歌悠扬。在新绿的草地上，苗族男女青年跳着籚笙舞，欢度今年的“三月节”。
    玩马郎是苗族青年进行恋爱活动的基本形式。在苗族聚居的村寨附近风景较优美的地方，都有马郎坡。解放后，当地由于对苗族风俗习惯照顾不够，不少马郎坡被开成耕地。去年台江县检查民族政策执行情况后，随即加以纠正，到目前为止已恢复马郎坡一百九十九处。对少数已成耕地而不能恢复的地方，经过和当地男女青年领袖“马郎头”“姑娘头”协商后，转移适当地点，重新开辟。青年团各级组织还着手领导苗族青年美化马郎坡。
