The leadership method of Guan Musheng, director of the Changfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, of "participating in production and leading production," has been promoted among rural work cadres and cadres of 791 agricultural cooperatives in Qingyuan County, Guangdong Province. The practice of preparing for and carrying out spring plowing during this period has proved that this leadership method is a working method that truly implements the mass line and an effective way to improve the leadership level of cadres and strengthen the relationship between cadres and the masses.

The preparation for and spring plowing production after the Spring Festival in Qingyuan County was carried out very well in some areas, but in other areas, it was uneven or even stagnated. After the Qingyuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China studied the article on Guan Musheng's leadership method published in the People's Daily on March 2, it believed that cadres participating in production and leading production was the key to promoting the comprehensive and balanced development of the spring plowing production campaign in the county. Thus, on March 8, the County Committee made a decision on "Learning Guan Musheng's Leadership Method," calling on all rural work cadres and cadres above the production team leader of agricultural cooperatives in the county to learn. The decision put forward two requirements: (1) Through learning, get rid of the bureaucracy of cooperative cadres, improve leadership style, earnestly "participate in production, lead production," and effectively carry out the current spring plowing production; (2) After learning, establish a method of "fixed work attendance, fixed subsidy, evaluation and reward" to ensure the implementation of Guan Musheng's leadership method institutionally.

The County Committee's decision was widely welcomed and supported by rural work cadres, agricultural production cooperative cadres, and cooperative members throughout the county. The leadership style of cadres has indeed been significantly improved, and spring plowing production has been vigorously carried out. Seventy-five township-level cadres detached from production in the Shitan District, except for township clerks who manage some daily administrative affairs, have all gone to agricultural cooperatives to directly participate in production and lead production. Two hundred and twenty-six of the two hundred and twenty-seven agricultural cooperative directors and deputy directors have learned Guan Musheng's leadership method and are actively leading cooperative members to carry out spring plowing production. The amount of fertilizer accumulated in this area is now the largest in the county, averaging 117 dan per mu, the attendance rate of cooperative members is 96%, and various production tasks have been completed very well. The Fengxing Agricultural Cooperative in Dayan Township was assigned a task of afforestation of 350 mu by the district. By March 3, 200 mu had been completed, and the remaining 150 mu was planned to be abandoned due to the lack of saplings. Chen Shuiqing, the deputy director of the cooperative, discussed solutions with the cooperative members while working in the fields. The cooperative members suggested that there were many saplings behind Yangshan and that the afforestation task could be completed. Chen Shuiqing accepted the cooperative members' suggestions and found 3,100 saplings behind Yangshan, solving the problem of saplings for 150 mu of land and completing the afforestation task according to plan. The accountant of the Xinwei Agricultural Cooperative in Shantang District used to think that doing accounting could not participate in production, and participating in production could not do accounting work; after learning, it was decided to participate in production in the morning and do accounting work in the afternoon. Originally, there were six full-time cadres in this cooperative of 114 households, and now they all participate in production according to the "fixed work attendance, fixed subsidy, evaluation and reward" system. Cooperative members generally reflected: the cadres are very determined, and there will definitely be a bumper harvest this year. Some said: "If this year's income does not increase, we will not complain about the cadres."

    向官木生学习，参加生产，领导生产
    官木生的领导方法传到了广东清远县
    湖北省孝感县长风农业社主任官木生“参加生产，领导生产”的领导方法，已经在广东省清远县农村工作干部和七百九十一个农业社的干部中推广了。这一段备耕和春耕生产的实践证明，这种领导方法是真正贯彻了群众路线的工作方法，是提高干部领导水平、密切干部和群众关系的有效办法。
    清远县春节后的备耕和春耕生产，在部分地区搞得很好，但另一部分地区却一起一伏甚至停滞不前。中共清远县委研究了3月2日人民日报发表的关于官木生领导方法的文章以后，认为干部参加生产领导生产是使全县的春耕生产运动全面地平衡地开展起来的关键。这样，县委于3月8日作出了“关于学习官木生领导方法”的决定，号召全县所有农村工作干部和农业社生产队长以上的干部学习。在决定中提出了两个要求：（一）通过学习，摆脱社干部的事务主义，改进领导作风，认真做到“参加生产、领导生产”，切实地把当前春耕生产搞好；（二）学习以后，定出“定工出勤，定额补助，评比奖励”的办法，从制度上保证官木生领导方法的贯彻实现。
    县委的决定受到了全县农村工作干部、农业生产合作社干部和社员群众的普遍欢迎和拥护。干部领导作风确已有了显著的改进，春耕生产蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来了。石潭区七十五个乡级脱离生产干部，除留乡文书管理一些日常行政事务外，都分别到农业社里直接参加生产、领导生产。二百二十七个农业社正、副主任，有二百二十六个学会了官木生的领导方法，积极领导社员开展春耕生产。现在这个区的积肥数量是全县最多的，每亩平均一百一十七担，社员劳动出勤率达96％，各项生产任务完成得很好。大岩乡风星农业社，区里分配造林任务三百五十亩。到3月3日完成了二百亩，还有一百五十亩因无树秧，打算不完成了。这个社副主任陈水清在田间劳动的时候，和社员们一起商量办法。社员提出阳山后树秧很多，可以完成植树任务。陈水清接受了社员意见，果然在阳山后找到了树秧三千一百株，解决了一百五十亩地的树秧问题，按计划完成了造林任务。山塘区新围农业社会计员过去认为做会计不能参加生产，参加了生产就不能做会计工作；经过学习以后，决定上午参加生产，下午做会计工作。这个社一百一十四户，原来有六个脱产干部，现在都按“定工出勤，定额补助，评比奖励”制度参加生产了。社员普遍反映：干部决心很大，今年一定大丰收。有的说：“如果今年不增加收入，也不埋怨干部了”。
