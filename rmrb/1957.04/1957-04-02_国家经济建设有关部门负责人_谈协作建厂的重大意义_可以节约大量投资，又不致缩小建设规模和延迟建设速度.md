Xinhua News Agency, April 1st. Xinhua News Agency reporter Sun Minghui reported: When visiting several departments related to national economic construction, many responsible persons believed that the organization of five machine factories in a new industrial zone in Shaanxi Province according to the principle of collaboration has great economic significance. It points out a way to increase production and practice economy that has been neglected by some people for a long time.

    The importance of this matter lies in the fact that it proves that doing so can save a large amount of investment without reducing the scale of construction or delaying the speed of construction, and at the same time will bring great benefits to future production.

    At present, there is a lack of unified planning in the construction of new industrial zones, and there are cases where various departments are doing their own thing. On the other hand, in the existing factory production collaboration arrangements, production is often affected due to poor organization. Some people are also afraid of trouble and are unwilling to collaborate with other factories, and they are still blindly pursuing so-called "all-around" factories, hoping that everything can be solved by their own factory. In Harbin, there are three factories that can collaborate with each other in terms of castings and forgings, so that some factories do not need to build their own casting workshops. However, these three factories jointly wrote a report to their superiors, requesting to do their own thing. In Shanghai, one factory has a large laboratory capacity and can help another factory with experiments. However, this factory refused to do so, and the other factory did not like collaboration either, and asked the state to allocate funds to build a new laboratory, even though the two factories were only a wall apart and belonged to the same manufacturing department.

    It is for this reason that in the past few years, in some industrial zones, despite the surplus production capacity of castings, forgings, standard parts and other products in existing factories, newly built and renovated factories are still building and expanding their own similar workshops. As a result, in these areas, almost every newly built and renovated factory is a comprehensive so-called "all-around" factory, with its own casting and forging workshops, carpentry workshops, standard parts workshops, tool workshops, repair workshops, boiler rooms, gas stations, laboratories, etc. This decentralized construction, on the one hand, excessively consumes state investment; on the other hand, many factories cannot fully utilize their production capacity due to their small production scale and low equipment load. For example, some factories only utilize about 10% of their forging capacity. Due to the inability to fully utilize equipment capacity, it is more difficult to adopt advanced technology, so labor productivity is very low, costs are very high, and product quality is often not guaranteed.

    According to relevant estimates, building a factory with an annual output of 64,000 tons of castings can save about 25% of the total investment compared to building eight decentralized workshops with an annual output of 8,000 tons of castings. Due to more specialized production and larger output after collaboration, it is easier to adopt more efficient equipment and concentrate stronger technical forces, which will not only increase labor productivity, but also reduce product costs much lower than decentralized production.

    This point has not only been proven by the example of the five machine factories in the industrial zone in Shaanxi Province, but also by the examples of some other factories that have implemented collaboration. For example, the Lanzhou Petroleum Machinery Factory and the Lanzhou Petrochemical Equipment Factory can save a large amount of investment simply by building thirteen projects such as casting and forging workshops, carpentry workshops, boiler rooms, and gas stations according to the principle of collaboration. At the same time, due to the improved equipment utilization rate, reduced personnel, and reduced product costs, a lot of production and management costs can also be saved every year after being put into production.

    However, some people are still worried that collaborative factories cannot guarantee the supply of collaborative products, which will affect future production. This concern is based on the fact that some factories that have undertaken collaborative tasks in the past often only cared about completing their own production tasks and did not complete collaborative tasks in a timely manner due to poor production organization or departmentalism. However, if you analyze it carefully, you will find that this concern is unnecessary. On the one hand, the shortcomings in past collaboration can be overcome, and in fact, relevant departments are working to overcome them; on the other hand, the task of regional collaborative factories is to specialize in producing collaborative products for various factories, and its collaborative relationship with other factories is fixed at the time of factory construction. In this case, as long as the production is well organized, it will complete the production tasks of the collaborative products entrusted by other factories on time. At the same time, since the collaborative relationship is fixed at the time of factory construction, it will also avoid the current awkward situation of many production units going everywhere to "seek gods and worship Buddhas" in order to find collaborative partners.

    The organization of collaboration among the five machine factories in the new industrial zone in Shaanxi Province also proves that it is difficult to realize the construction of factories according to the principle of collaboration without the planned organization of the relevant general management departments. This is because regional collaboration cannot be achieved by one department or one factory. In an industrial zone, there are often many departments building factories there; and these factories are often designed by different design departments. According to past experience, these different departments and factories often do not communicate with each other and bury themselves in their own work. Therefore, it is very necessary for the state planning and management departments to fully consider the collaborative factors when arranging long-term plans, carrying out planning for new industrial zones, and approving factory designs, and how to communicate the connections between various departments and arrange the collaborative relationships between various departments and enterprises. At the same time, the role of the design department in this regard cannot be ignored. If the design department can conduct extensive investigation and research and fully consider collaborative factors when designing a factory, it will be of great benefit to promoting collaboration.

    Since my country's planning system has been established, it is possible to organize collaboration on a regional basis. Especially at present, my country is formulating the second five-year plan, and many new industrial zones are still being formed; in this case, if we do not consider establishing professional collaborative factories or workshops and establishing regional thermal power stations, boiler rooms, gas stations and other public facilities on a regional basis in a timely manner, as a designer said, we will regret it in the future and cause extremely unreasonable conditions for production and construction.

    According to relevant sources, organizing factory construction according to the principle of collaboration is a very complex and very detailed work. It is necessary to consider economic rationality, but also to consider the needs and possibilities. It is necessary to take into account the current interests, but also to take into account the future interests. It cannot be engaged in blindly. However, it is also wrong to use caution as an excuse and emphasize difficulties without actively organizing just because this is a complex task.

    国家经济建设有关部门负责人
    谈协作建厂的重大意义
    可以节约大量投资，又不致缩小建设规模和延迟建设速度
    新华社1日讯　新华社记者孙铭惠报道：记者在访问几个国家经济建设有关部门的时候，许多负责人认为，陕西省一个新的工业区的五个机器厂将按协作原则组织建厂这件事，具有重大的经济意义，它指出了长时期以来被一些人忽视了的一个增产节约的途径。
    这件事之所以重要，就在于它证明这样做可以节约大量投资，而又不致于缩小建设规模，延迟建设的速度，同时又会给将来的生产带来莫大的利益。
    目前，在新工业区建设上还缺少统一规划，存在着各个部门各干各的情况；另方面，在现有工厂生产协作安排中，由于组织得不好，影响生产的情况常常发生，有些人还怕麻烦，不愿和别厂协作，还一味追求所谓“全能”厂，希图什么都由本厂自己生产解决。在哈尔滨，有三个工厂在铸锻件方面可以互相协作，这样有的厂就可以不必建设自己的铸工车间。但是这三个厂却联合向上级写报告，要求各干各的。在上海，有一个厂的实验室能力很大，可以帮助另一个厂做实验。但这个厂却拒绝这样做，而另一个厂也不喜欢协作，要求国家拨款建设一个新的实验室，尽管这两个厂只有一墙之隔，同属一个制造部门。
    正是这种原因，过去几年来在一些工业区里，尽管现有工厂的铸件、锻件、标准件等产品的生产能力有剩余，但是新建、改建工厂却仍然在建设和扩充自己厂的同样的车间。结果，在这些地区，新建、改建厂差不多每个厂都是综合性的所谓“全能”厂，都有自己的铸锻车间、木工车间、标准件车间、工具车间、修理车间、锅炉房、煤气站、实验室等等。这种分散建设，一方面过多地消耗了国家投资；另一方面，许多厂由于生产规模小、设备负荷低，生产能力不能充分发挥。例如有些厂的锻造能力只利用了百分之十几。由于设备能力不能充分发挥，采用先进工艺就比较困难，因此劳动生产率很低，成本很高，而且产品质量往往不能保证。
    据有关方面估算，建设一个年产六万四千吨铸件的工厂，要比分散建设的八个年产八千吨铸件的车间，总共可以少用投资25％左右。由于协作以后生产更加专业，产量大，因而便于采用效率比较高的设备，集中较强大的技术力量，这样不但劳动生产率可以提高，产品成本也要比分散生产低得多。
    这一点，不仅已经为陕西省这个工业区五个机器厂的事例所证明，而且也为其他一些实行协作的工厂的事例所证明。例如兰州石油机械厂和兰州炼油化工设备厂，仅仅由于铸锻车间、木工车间、锅炉房、煤气站等十三项工程，按协作原则建设，就可以节省很大一笔投资。同时由于设备利用率提高，人员减少，产品成本降低，投入生产以后每年还可以节省很多生产管理费用。
    但是目前还有人担心协作厂不能保证协作产品的供应，影响将来的生产。这种担心是鉴于过去某些担负协作任务的工厂由于生产组织得不好，或者有本位主义思想，往往只顾完成本厂生产任务，而不及时完成协作任务。但是如果仔细分析，就会发现这种顾虑是不必要的。一方面，过去协作中的缺点是可以克服的，事实上有关部门也正在着手克服；另方面，区域性的协作厂的任务，是专门为各厂生产协作产品，它和别厂的协作关系，是在建厂时就固定了的。在这种情况下，只要生产组织得好，就会按时地完成别厂所委托的协作产品的生产任务。同时由于协作关系是在建厂时就固定了的，也会避免目前不少生产单位为了寻找协作对象到处“求神拜佛”的窘况。
    陕西省新工业区五个机器厂组织协作还证明，有关的总管部门如果不加以有计划地组织，按协作原则建厂这件事也是很难实现的。这是因为按区域组织协作不是一个部门、一个工厂所能做到的。在一个工业区里，往往有许多部门在那里建厂；而这些工厂又常常是不同的设计部门设计的。根据过去的经验，这些不同的部门、工厂又常常互不通气，各自埋头干自己的事。因此，国家计划总管部门在安排长远计划、进行新工业区规划和审批工厂设计的时候，如何把协作因素充分考虑在内，如何沟通各部门之间的联系，安排各部门、各企业之间的协作关系，是十分必要的。同时，设计部门在这方面的作用也是不能忽视的。设计部门在设计一个工厂时，如果能够广泛调查研究，充分考虑协作因素，对于推进协作有很大好处。
    由于我国计划制度已经建立，按区域地组织协作是具备条件的。特别是目前我国正在拟订第二个五年计划，许多新工业区还在形成；在这种情况下如果不及时地考虑按区域地建立专业性的协作工厂或车间，建立区域性的热电站、锅炉房、煤气站等公用设施，正如一位设计师所说的，将来就会后悔不及，给生产建设造成极不合理的状况。
    据有关方面说，按协作原则组织建厂是一件十分复杂、十分细致的工作，既要考虑经济合理，又要考虑需要可能，既要照顾到现在利益，又要照顾到将来利益，不能盲目从事。但是如果因为这是一件复杂的工作，就借口慎重，强调困难，不积极组织，也是不对的。
