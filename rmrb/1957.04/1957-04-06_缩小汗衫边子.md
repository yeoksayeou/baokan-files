    Reduce Sweatshirt Hems
    The Shanghai Intimate Apparel Knitting Industrial Company's factories have decided to shorten the bottom and sleeve hems of sweatshirts slightly, without affecting quality, to save cotton yarn.
    The bottom and sleeve hems of the sweatshirts produced by the factories were originally wider than imported goods. Now, the bottom hem of the crew-neck sweatshirt will be changed from three centimeters to two and a half centimeters, and the sleeve hem will be changed from three centimeters to two centimeters, saving 0.54 taels of cotton yarn per dozen. Improvements have also been made to children's sweatshirts, saving one tael of cotton yarn per dozen. In this way, a total of 75 pieces of cotton yarn can be saved this year, and these yarns can be used to produce 11,250 dozens of sweatshirts.

    缩小汗衫边子
    上海市内衣针织工业公司所属各厂决定在不影响质量的前提下，把汗衫的下边和袖边缩短一点点，以节省棉纱。
    各厂出产的汗衫的下边和袖边，原来都比进口货阔，现将圆领汗衫的下边由三公分改为二点五公分，袖边由三公分改为二公分，每打便能节约棉纱零点五四两；小孩汗衫也作了改进，每打可节约棉纱一两。这样，今年共可节约棉纱七十五件，用这些纱能够生产汗衫一万一千二百五十打。
