Moscow, April 17th (from our correspondent) Just as Soviet newspapers are extensively reporting Chairman Voroshilov's visit to Beijing, this reporter arrived at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, over a hundred kilometers from Moscow, and met with Director Dmitri Ivanovich Blokhintsev and the Chinese researchers there. Blokhintsev said, "The friendship between the Soviet and Chinese people is so deep, so solid, and developing so smoothly that I don't need to say much more. I personally know Comrade Voroshilov. He cares about everything and, despite his age, enjoys being active. I am very happy that the Chinese people can personally meet our outstanding political activist during Comrade Voroshilov's visit to China. Comrade Voroshilov is one of our leaders, and this visit to China will further consolidate our friendly relations and bring practical benefits."

Scientists from twelve socialist countries are participating in research work at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. China also has a group of scientific researchers there. According to Director Blokhintsev, Chinese scientific researchers are engaged in genuine cooperation with Soviet and other socialist countries' scientific researchers at the institute. All research work is conducted in an atmosphere of friendship and mutual assistance. Chinese scientific researchers are highly respected at the institute and contribute to its work; they participate in solving important issues related to the institute. Over the past six months, Soviet and Chinese scientific researchers have had very good contact and respect for each other.

At the institute, Soviet scientific researchers provide fraternal assistance to scientific researchers from China and other socialist countries. This is the common feeling of Chinese scientific researchers. Wang Ganchang, the head of the Chinese scientific researchers, told me: "Since we came here, we have received great help from Soviet comrades and have benefited a lot. We are conducting research here, and at the same time, we are learning. Soviet comrades take good care of us, and they tell us everything we don't know. We can also get the equipment we need as a priority." Wang Ganchang believes that the conditions at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research are very favorable. Especially after the world's largest synchrophasotron began operating, there is much more to study, making it an excellent place to train nuclear science talents. However, the number of people China has sent here is still small." He hopes that China can send as many people with considerable skills as possible to the institute to learn more.

Zhou Guangzhao, another Chinese researcher, said, "At the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, I feel closer to the forefront of the world's latest science." Besides the enthusiastic help from Soviet comrades, Zhou Guangzhao said that he is most satisfied with three things about the institute: First, there is an atmosphere of creative scientific research; second, free debates are often held; and third, the results of world nuclear science research are quickly absorbed. There are many free debates here, and the more the issues are debated, the clearer they become, and the research becomes more in-depth. There are also frequent debates between senior and young researchers. The latest scientific developments in various countries are also obtained relatively quickly here. Here, Soviet comrades pay great attention to studying the latest scientific achievements. For example, after the discovery that the "parity conservation law" is incorrect in some cases, ten studies have already been conducted here.

The synchrophasotron at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research has begun operating. People at the institute are very happy to know that the Chinese scientific community attaches great importance to this event. They said: Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, even sent a congratulatory telegram! Director Blokhintsev said, "The start of operation of the world's largest synchrophasotron has opened up a huge field for further research on nuclei. Not only the Soviet Union but also foreign countries have greatly increased their interest in the institute. I think China's interest in the institute will also grow. American scientists will submit several problems to our institute for solution. The institute is currently mastering this accelerator. We will hold an academic conference in May to discuss the accelerator's work plan and the institute's construction and international connections."

Comrade Blokhintsev warmly welcomed more Chinese scientists to come to the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. He knows that a group of Chinese engineers will come to the institute this year. He said, "We hope that more Chinese physicists will come to participate in work and study. Now is a particularly good time to send scientific workers to the institute. We also welcome young scientific workers, and our institute has many scientific researchers around twenty-five years old."

    在世界最新科学的前线—联合核子研究所
    中苏科学家互助合作进行研究
    布洛欣泽夫、王淦昌都说希望中国派去更多研究人员
    本报莫斯科17日电  正是苏联报纸大量刊登伏罗希洛夫主席在北京的访问活动的时候，记者到了离莫斯科一百多公里的杜勃纳联合核子研究所，会见了所长德米特里·伊凡诺维奇·布洛欣泽夫同志和在那里的我国研究人员。布洛欣泽夫说：“苏中两国人民之间的友谊是这样深厚，是这样巩固和顺利地发展，不用我多说什么。我个人认识伏罗希洛夫同志。他关心一切事情，虽然年高，但喜欢活动。我很高兴，中国人民在伏罗希洛夫同志访问中国的时候能够亲自认识我国出色的政治活动家。伏罗希洛夫同志是我国领导人之一，他的这次访问中国将更加巩固我们的友好关系，将带来实际的益处。”
    在联合核子研究所有十二个社会主义国家的科学家参加研究工作。我国也有一批科学研究人员在那里。据布洛欣泽夫所长说，在研究所里，中国科学研究人员和苏联以及其他社会主义国家的科学研究人员，进行真正的合作。所有的研究工作都是在友好互助的气氛中进行的。中国科学研究人员在研究所里很有声望，对研究所的工作有贡献，有关研究所中的重要问题的解决都有他们参加。在半年多的过程中，苏联和中国的科学研究人员有着很好的接触并且互相敬爱着。
    在研究所里，苏联科学研究人员给我国以及其他社会主义国家的科学研究人员以兄弟般的帮助。这是我国科学研究人员的共同感觉。我国科学研究人员的负责人王淦昌告诉我说：“我们来到这里以后，得到苏联同志很大帮助，获益很多。我们在这里进行研究，同时也就是学习。苏联同志很照顾我们，凡是我们不知道的，苏联同志都告诉我们。我们所需要的器材、也能尽先供应。”王淦昌认为：联合核子研究所的条件很优越，特别是世界上最大的同步稳相加速器开始运转以后，可研究的东西大大增多，这是培养核子科学人才的很好处所，但我国派到这里来的人还少。”他希望我国能够尽量多派一些具有相当水平的人来研究所以便学习更多的东西。
    我国另一位科学研究员周光召说：“在联合核子研究所里，觉得更接近世界最新科学的前线。”除了苏联同志的热情帮助以外，周光召说，这个研究所最使他感到满意的有三点：首先，有创造性科学研究的气氛；其次，时常展开自由争论；再次，迅速吸收世界核子科学研究的成果。在这里自由争论很多，问题愈辩愈明，研究得比较深入。年长的和年青的科学研究人员之间也时常争论。各国最新科学情况这里也得到的比较快。在这里，苏联同志非常注意研究最新的科学成就，例如在“宇称守恒定律”发现在一些情况下是不正确的以后，这里已经进行了十次研究。
    联合核子研究所的同步稳相加速器已经开始运转。研究所的人们很高兴地知道中国科学界对这件事情的重视。他们说：中国科学院院长郭沫若都有贺电来啦！所长布洛欣泽夫说：“世界最大的同步稳相加速器的开始运转，为进一步研究核子开辟了巨大的园地。不仅苏联而且国外对研究所的兴趣也都大大增加了。我想，中国对研究所的兴趣也将增长。美国科学家将把若干问题提交给我们的研究所解决。现在研究所正在掌握这个加速器。我们将在5月间举行学术会议，讨论加速器的工作计划以及研究所的建设和国际联系问题。”
    布洛欣泽夫同志亲切地表示欢迎中国有更多的科学工作者到联合核子研究所来。他知道今年将有一批中国工程师来研究所。他说：“我们希望有更多的中国物理学家来参加工作和学习。现在特别有利于派送科学工作者来研究所。我们也欢迎年青的科学工作者来，我们的研究所有很多二十五岁左右的科学研究人员。”
