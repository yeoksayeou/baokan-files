Xinhua News Agency, April 10th – According to Taiwan newspapers, due to the Chiang Kai-shek clique's continuous increase in military spending and reduction of education funds, Taiwan's education is in a difficult situation. School buildings in many parts of Taiwan have been in disrepair for years and are in a dilapidated state, facing the danger of collapse during strong winds and heavy rains. Some primary and secondary schools are severely lacking desks, and students have to sit on the floor on newspapers during class. Some of the better school buildings are occupied by Chiang's troops for long periods. The news said that Chiang's troops and their families are stationed in eight primary schools in Taipei City, including Xing'an, Penglai, Dalong, and Taiping, and primary school students can only squeeze together and take turns attending classes. Some school staff members even have nowhere to work during the day or rest at night.

The Taiwan education authorities also dispatched a large number of military instructors and political workers to schools to suppress and monitor students' words and deeds. Taiwan newspapers said that some military instructors often use wooden sticks to force students to engage in military operations, and incidents often occur where students "are beaten half to death and become covered in bruises." Military instructors and political workers also "arbitrarily scold or insult students, causing great trauma to their hearts." Zhang Yongmao, a student at Xiluo Township Middle School in Yunlin County, was given a failing grade because he refused to participate in activities of the "Youth Anti-Communist National Salvation Corps" on weekdays, and he became pessimistic and disappointed, committing suicide by poisoning.

Taiwan newspapers also revealed the situation of "school commercialization" in Taiwan. Many schools have various workbooks, exercise books, and "reference books" available, which students are required to purchase at high prices at the beginning of the school year, and are not allowed to register if they do not purchase them. In addition, Taiwan education authorities force students to donate money under various pretexts. More than one hundred students who were admitted to Fengyuan County Commercial School after passing the examination were not allowed to enroll because they did not have money to pay the so-called enrollment "voluntary contribution" fee.

    校舍失修课桌缺　棍棒下面受军训
    今日的台湾教育
    新华社10日讯　据台湾报纸透露，由于蒋介石集团不断增加军费开支，缩减教育经费，使台湾教育事业处在困难境地。台湾各地许多学校校舍长年失修，破烂不堪，每逢大风大雨就有倒坍危险。有些中小学校中课桌奇缺，上课的学生竟铺着报纸席地而坐。有些比较好的校舍，多被蒋军部队长期占用。消息说，现在台北市的幸安、蓬莱、大龙、太平等八所小学校里都驻有蒋军部队和家眷，小学生们只能挤在一起轮流上课。有些学校中的教职员甚至也日无办公之处，夜无息宿之地。
    台湾教育当局还派遣大批军事教官和政工人员，在学校中压制学生和监视学生言行。台湾报纸说，有的军事教官经常用木棍胁迫学生从事军事操作，经常发生学生
  “被打得半死弄到遍体鳞伤的事件”。军事教官和政工人员并且
  “随意斥骂或侮辱学生，使学生心灵大受创伤”。台湾云林县西螺镇中学的学生张永茂，因为平日不愿参加“青年反共救国团”的活动，受到留级处分，他因此悲观失望，服毒自杀。
    台湾报纸还透露了台湾“学校商店化”的情况。许多学校备有各种作业簿、练习簿和“参考书”，在开学时要学生高价购买，不购买便不准注册。此外，台湾教育机关并以各种名目强迫学生捐款。丰原县商业学校有一百多个经过考试已被录取的学生，因为没有钱交纳所谓入学“乐捐”款，校方竟不准他们入学。
