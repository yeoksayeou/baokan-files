Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 1st – The incident of U.S. Army Sergeant Reynolds stationed in Taiwan shooting and killing Liu Ziran, a low-ranking Kuomintang official, has aroused dissatisfaction in Taiwan. Some Taiwan newspapers have already revealed a sense of indignation. Some Taipei newspapers recently exposed some of the truth about the American soldier's murder based on the results of the on-site investigation, and refuted the exculpatory words fabricated by the U.S. military after the killing. The newspapers also revealed that the murderer, Reynolds, had previously beaten a Taiwanese postal worker. The newspapers pointed out that Liu Ziran's shooting was "a matter that cannot be ignored" and demanded that "foreign murderers" should not have "exceptions within the law." Liu Ziran's wife has also demanded that the murderer who shot her husband be "brought to justice."

It is said that the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group in Taiwan, after this incident, immediately conducted a joint "investigation" with the Taiwan authorities, but the tragedy occurred on March 20th, and now it has been more than ten days. After so many days of "investigation," there is still no conclusion. It is said that even if the murderer is to be tried, the Taiwan authorities have no right to intervene, because the officers and soldiers of the Advisory Group enjoy privileges in Taiwan, and even if they commit a crime, the Taiwan Kuomintang authorities can do nothing about it.

    美军士兵打死国民党官员
    台湾报纸表示愤懑
    据新华社广州1日电　美国驻在台湾的陆军上士雷诺特枪杀国民党低级官员刘自然的事件，已经在台湾激起不满。一些台湾报纸已流露出一股愤懑之情。台北市一些报纸日前根据现场勘验的结果，揭露了美军杀人的部分真相，并且驳斥了美军杀人后捏造的诿罪之词。报纸还揭露，凶手雷诺特过去曾经殴打过一个台湾邮政工作人员。报纸指出，刘自然被枪杀是“一件不可忽视的事”，并且要求对“外籍凶手”不可“在法律之内有例外”。刘自然的妻子也已经要求对枪杀她丈夫的凶手“绳之以法”。
    美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团在这一事件发生后，据说即与台湾当局会同“调查”，但惨案在3月20日发生，到现在已经有十多天。“调查”了这么多天，至今却没有下文。据说即使要把凶手审讯，台湾当局也无权过问，因为顾问团的美军官兵在台湾享有特权，即使犯了法，台湾国民党当局也无可奈何。
