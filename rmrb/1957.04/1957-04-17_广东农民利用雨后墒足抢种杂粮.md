    Guangdong Farmers Seize Rainy Season to Rush-Plant Coarse Grains
    (Our report) Guangdong's Party and government leading organs at all levels are actively leading farmers to seize the opportunity of soil moisture after the rain to hurry up and plant various coarse grains. Up to now, more than 3.5 million mu of coarse grains such as sweet potatoes, corn, millet, sorghum, cassava, and taro have been planted, an increase of 600,000 to 700,000 mu compared with the sowing progress in the same period last year. Farmers in the Leizhou Peninsula and Hainan Island, which are rich in sweet potatoes, have generally advanced the planting period this spring so that sweet potato seedlings can grow more vigorously. Sangtian Township in Chaoyang County has also reclaimed more than 1,150 mu of barren slopes and planted more than 600,000 cassava plants, which can generate more than 50,000 yuan in income.
    Coarse grains in Guangdong Province rank second in the province's total grain production. According to the plan of the provincial agricultural department, the planting area of ​​coarse grains this year will reach 31.1 million mu, an increase of 1.66 million mu over last year, requiring an increase of 1.23 billion jin, accounting for 62% of the province's annual grain production increase task. In order to realize this plan, the province has specially convened a coarse grain production increase meeting, requiring more than 1,100 agricultural technology promotion stations throughout the province to use various methods to strengthen technical guidance on coarse grain production, adopt different yield-increasing measures according to different crops, and implement intensive cultivation, intercropping between fields, expanding the area, and rational crop rotation to increase the yield of coarse grains. Recently, the Provincial Department of Agriculture purchased more than 1,800 dan of high-yielding corn seeds from other provinces to supply farmers for planting; it also vigorously helped farmers cultivate sweet potato seedlings to promote sweet potato rejuvenation so that the yield can be increased by 30% to 40%. In order to increase the enthusiasm of farmers in increasing the production of coarse grains, the province is also prepared to reasonably adjust the work points of the commune members for staple food and coarse grain farm work and reward model units or individuals who have achieved a bumper harvest of various coarse grains.

    广东农民利用雨后墒足抢种杂粮
    本报讯　广东省各地党政领导机关，正在积极领导农民利用雨后土壤湿润的时机，抓紧播种各种杂粮。到目前为止，已播种番薯、玉米、粟类、高粱、木薯、芋头等杂粮三百五十多万亩，比去年同期的播种进度增长六、七十万亩。盛产番薯的雷州半岛和海南岛等地的农民，今春普遍提早了种植期，使番薯苗能更加健旺地生长；潮阳县桑田乡还开垦了一千一百五十多亩荒坡，栽木薯六十多万株，可收入五万多元。
    广东省的杂粮占全省粮食的第二位。据省农业部门的计划，今年杂粮的播种面积要达到三千一百一十万亩，比去年扩大一百六十六万亩，要求增产十二亿三千万斤，占全省全年粮食增产任务的62％。为了实现这一计划，这个省已经专门召开过杂粮增产会议，要求全省一千一百多个农业技术推广站，利用各种方式加强对杂粮生产的技术指导工作，按照不同的作物采取不同的增产措施，实行精耕细作、田垅间种、扩大面积、合理轮栽等方法，来提高杂粮的产量。最近，省农业厅从外省调购了一千八百多担高产的玉米良种，供应农民种植；并大力帮助农民培育薯苗，以促进番薯复壮，使产量能够提高三到四成。为提高农民增产杂粮的积极性，这个省还准备合理调整社员对主粮和杂粮农活的工分、奖励各种杂粮丰产的模范单位或个人。（李少球）
