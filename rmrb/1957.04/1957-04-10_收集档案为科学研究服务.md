    Collecting Archives to Serve Scientific Research
    People's Daily Commentator
    Historical archives, like ancient cultural relics, physical specimens, and books and periodicals, are indispensable materials for scientific research.
    Among these materials, archives are the most basic materials for studying the political, economic, and cultural history of a country. Only based on archival materials can historical research be done better. Currently, many historians deeply feel the lack of archival materials, so that many important issues in modern Chinese economic history cannot be resolved. This shows the importance of promptly collecting, preserving, and organizing historical archives for scientific research.
    Due to the invasion and plunder by imperialism and the lack of attention to the development of science and culture by successive reactionary rulers, large quantities of archives were stolen, fraudulently sold, and arbitrarily destroyed, so that now, China's historical archives can be said to be fragmented and incomplete. It is an extremely important task to treasure and preserve the few historical archives that remain and make full use of them. Currently, many places are organizing the archives they have preserved. However, some places still lack unified leadership; some places have many archives but lack organizers; some places have very poor storage conditions, and the archives are subject to moisture and dust, and some have become hard blocks, so they cannot be fully utilized.
    At present, apart from some places where relatively many archives are concentrated, the archives of central and local agencies since the Ming and Qing dynasties, the archives of enterprises and organizations, and the archives of imperialist enterprises and schools in China in the past are mostly scattered throughout the country. Some are preserved by current agencies, some change owners with the houses, and many people do not understand the value of historical archives, treating them as waste paper, piling them up in warehouses, or selling or burning them. For example, a court in a certain city in Zhejiang Province originally had all the archives from the third year of Xuantong to before liberation, but they were burned as waste paper for six months and all were burned; all the enemy and puppet archives stored in an agency in Hunan Province were sold from the beginning of liberation until 1954, and all were sold. Even recently, China's oldest university, Peking University, burned almost all of its archives since its establishment at the end of the Qing Dynasty. We do not deny that many archives have lost their value for preservation due to the passage of time; but without cleaning and reviewing them, how can we distinguish between jade and stubborn stone?
    Since the liberation of the whole country, especially since the call for strengthening scientific research work, many research institutions, universities, and historical museums and exhibition halls have been collecting the archives they need. This situation is of course unavoidable. Because we do not have decent archives to provide them with information. However, this decentralized collection method can only result in each unit preserving a part of what it needs in a scattered way, but none of them are complete; and because some collectors lack archival business knowledge, they sometimes disperse the archives of agencies that have already been concentrated. This is detrimental to the centralization of archives.
    Archives are the historical wealth of the country and have multiple uses. They must be concentrated in a planned way and managed uniformly by the state. The establishment of archives of various nature, such as ancient historical archives, modern historical archives, national economic and technical archives, and military historical archives, facilitates scientific research and other uses.
    Since the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the Party and the government have given great care to archival work. Much work has been done in receiving the archives of the old regime, managing the archives of abolished agencies, improving the archival work of current agencies, and cultivating archival workers. However, in the face of the urgent need for archival materials in all aspects of scientific research and national construction in our country, in addition to paying attention to continuously improving the archival work of current agencies (this is an important aspect), we must also cooperate with the current development of scientific research and national construction work. Within the scope of national manpower and material resources, actively and step by step do a good job in collecting historical archives, improve the working conditions of existing national archives, and prepare to build new archives, so as to widely and fully utilize historical archival documents.
    In order to accomplish this task, the national archives management agency (State Archives Administration) should do its best to do investigation work to find out the current scattered locations of historical archives. In addition to seriously leading the collection of revolutionary historical archives, it should also immediately begin to investigate and collect the archives of all old regime agencies before liberation, as well as the archives of all abolished enterprises, schools, and organizations, and the archives of famous people. The later we start, the greater the loss, which is detrimental to the long-term use of historical materials in the future.
    The behavior of randomly destroying and selling all archives in various places should be stopped immediately. Before the state has concentrated the archives that have been investigated and registered, the agencies, organizations, libraries, museums, etc. that currently preserve historical archives should be responsible for protecting the integrity and safety of the archives. Those who arbitrarily destroy or sell archives should be subject to administrative sanctions or legal punishment.
    The national archives management agency should concentrate the national historical archives in batches over several years, establish central and local archives, organize manpower, and organize them as soon as possible, so as to give full play to the role of archives and serve my country's scientific research and national construction.
    The State Archives Administration should, in conjunction with relevant agencies, study the scope of confidentiality of archives, for example, stipulating how many years ago archives can be made public, and which archives of abolished agencies and organizations can be used. It should also organize archival preservation departments to publish some collections of document materials needed by my country's academic circles, or use newspapers and periodicals to announce some historical materials (for example, the First Historical Archives has published "Historical Materials on the Sino-French War," "The Revolution of 1911," "Historical Materials on the Boxer Rebellion," etc.). In short, don't wait until all historical archives are organized before using them, but actively use the materials that have been organized to meet the urgent needs of current scientific research work. Due to the current lack of archival staff in our country, historical science researchers should actively assist in the construction of my country's archival work. The close cooperation between historians and archivists is an important condition for improving my country's archival work.

    收集档案为科学研究服务
    本报评论员
    历史档案同古代文物、实物标本以及图书报刊一样，都是科学研究工作不可缺少的资料。
    在这些资料中，档案是研究一个国家政治、经济、文化历史的最基本的资料。只有根据档案材料，才能使历史研究工作做得更好。目前，许多历史学家都深感档案材料的不足，以致中国近代经济史中的许多重要问题得不到解决。由此可见，从速收集、保存和整理历史档案对于科学研究的重要性。
    由于帝国主义的侵略、掠夺和历代反动统治者不注意科学文化事业的发展，大批档案任人盗窃骗卖和任意销毁，以至到现在，我国历史档案，可以说已经支离破碎，残缺不全了。把现在仅存的一些历史档案珍重地保存起来，并充分加以利用，是一件极为重要的工作。目前，许多地方对于保存的档案，正在进行整理。但是，有的地方还缺乏统一的领导；有的地方档案很多，却缺乏整理人员；有的地方保管条件很差，档案受着潮湿和灰尘的侵袭，有些已变成硬块，以至不能得到充分利用。
    目前我国除了有些地方集中了比较多的档案以外，明清以来的中央和地方机关的档案，企业、团体的档案，以及帝国主义过去在我国的企业、学校的档案，绝大部分还是分散在全国各地，有的由现在的机关保存，有的随着房屋而更换主人，更由于许多人对于历史档案的价值不了解，把它看作废纸，乱堆在仓库里，或者卖掉、烧掉。例如浙江省某市法院，原来曾存有从宣统三年到解放前的全部档案，但是被当作废纸烧了六个月，全部烧光；湖南省一个机关所存的全部敌伪档案，从解放初一直卖到1954年，全部卖光。甚至最近我国最古老的大学——北京大学也把它自清末成立以来的档案差不多全烧掉了。我们并不否认，有许多档案由于时间的推移，已经失去保存价值；但是没有经过清理和审查，又怎能分清美玉和顽石呢？
    自从全国解放以来，特别是自从号召加强科学研究工作以来，许多研究机关、高等学校和历史博物馆、陈列馆都在收集自己所需要的档案。这种情况当然是不得已的。因为我们没有像样的档案馆为他们提供资料。但是这种分散收集的做法，结果只能是各单位都零散地保存了自己所需要的一部分，却又都不完整；而且由于有些收集人员缺乏档案业务知识，有时反把已经集中在一起的机关的档案分散了。这样反而给档案的集中带来损害。
    档案是国家的历史财富，有多方面的使用价值，必须有计划地集中起来，由国家统一管理。成立各种性质的档案馆，如古代历史档案馆、近代历史档案馆、国民经济技术档案馆、军事历史档案馆等，才便于科学研究和其它各方面的使用。
    中华人民共和国建立以来，党和政府对于档案工作曾给予巨大的关怀。在接收旧政权的档案，管理已撤销的机关的档案，改善现行机关的档案工作以及培养档案工作人材方面，都做了许多工作。但是，面对着我国科学研究和国家建设各方面对于档案资料的迫切需要，除了注意不断改善现行机关的档案工作（这是重要的一面）以外，还要配合当前科学研究和国家建设工作的开展，在国家人力物力许可的范围内，积极地、有步骤地做好历史档案的收集工作，改善现有的国家档案馆的工作状况，筹建新的档案馆，以便广泛地充分地利用历史档案文件。
    为了完成这项工作，国家档案管理机关（国家档案局）应当尽力做好调查工作，查明历史档案现在的散存地点。除了认真领导征集革命历史档案的工作以外，对于解放以前一切旧政权机关的档案，以及一切撤销了的企业、学校、社团的档案，著名人物的档案，也应当立刻开始进行调查和收集。动手越晚，损失越大，这对于今后长期利用史料是不利的。
    对于各地随便销毁和出卖一切档案的行为应当立即制止。在国家还没有把已经调查登记了的档案集中起来以前，现在保存有历史档案的机关、团体以及图书馆、博物馆等，应当负责保护档案的完整和安全，随意销毁或出卖档案的应当受到行政的处分或法律的制裁。
    国家档案管理机关应当在若干年内，分期分批地集中全国的历史档案，建立中央和地方的档案馆，组织人力，从速整理，以便充分发挥档案的作用，为我国的科学研究和国家建设服务。
    国家档案局应当会同有关机关研究档案的保密范围，例如规定多少年以前的档案可以公开使用，那一些撤销了的机关、团体的档案可以使用。还应该有计划地组织档案保管部门出版一些我国学术界目前需要的一些文件材料汇集，或利用报刊公布一些史料
  （例如第一历史档案馆曾出版过“中法战争史料”、“辛亥革命”、“义和团史料”等等）。总之，不要等到全部历史档案整理完毕才利用它们，而应积极利用现在已经整理过的材料，以配合目前科学研究工作的迫切需要。由于目前我国档案工作人员的缺乏，历史科学研究者应当积极地协助我国档案工作的建设，历史学家和档案工作者的密切合作，是改进我国档案工作的一个重要条件。
