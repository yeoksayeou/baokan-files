A New Page in the History of the Yellow River
Wang Huayun, Deputy Director of the Sanmenxia Yellow River Engineering Bureau

The Sanmenxia Water Control Project on the Yellow River officially commenced on April 13th. The Sanmenxia Water Control Project is a major component of the "Comprehensive Plan for Eliminating the Yellow River's Water Hazards and Developing its Water Resources." The successful completion of this project will lay a solid foundation for the full realization of the first phase of the Yellow River control plan.

Three Years of Preparation

Over the past three years, with the leadership of the Central Government and the support of the people of the whole country and the Soviet people, we have carried out massive surveying, design, and construction preparation work. First, we conducted extensive data collection work, including topographic surveys, geological explorations, and hydrological and sediment measurements. At the same time, starting in 1956, we constructed a series of construction preparation projects. Second, we commissioned the Leningrad Hydroelectric Design Branch of the Soviet Union to design the water control project and hydroelectric station, while relevant domestic departments carried out designs for irrigation, tributary reservoirs, soil and water conservation measures, water transport, and auxiliary projects for the water control project. In the preliminary design phase, over 1,000 technical personnel from the Leningrad Design Branch alone participated in this work, and many experts personally traveled to the construction site and the vast Yellow River basin for inspection. After completing the preliminary design essentials in April 1956, the detailed and meticulously calculated preliminary design work, which was extensive, was completed in January of this year. We express our heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet government and the Soviet people for their friendship.

Automated Hydroelectric Station

The entire water control project structure, what we usually call the dam, includes the overflow dam, the non-overflow dam on the right bank, and the non-overflow dam on the left bank, as well as a hydroelectric station. These four parts of the building are connected together to form the entire water control project.

The hydroelectric station is an important part of the entire water control project. The preliminary design determined that eight generating units would be installed in the hydroelectric station. Each unit has an output of 137,500 kilowatts, and the generating capacity of the eight units is 1.1 million kilowatts, with an annual power generation of 6 billion kilowatt-hours.

The automation level of this hydroelectric station is such that, under normal operation, the machine room will be unmanned, with remote control set up in Luoyang. To allow for flexible deployment and unified time calculation, the station is equipped with automatic telephones, radio paging signals, a three-circuit electric clock station, and a radio broadcasting center.

Advanced Economic Indicators

Regarding the workload, investment, and economic indicators of the water control project, we compared it with twelve well-known water conservancy projects in the world. Only two were slightly better than the Sanmenxia Water Control Project, and the rest were not as good. This shows that its economic indicators are good. However, its workload and investment are still huge numbers. Excluding the railways, highways, and residences we designed ourselves, the excavation and filling of earth and stone amounts to 16,915,000 cubic meters, and the concrete pouring volume is 2,953,000 cubic meters. The total investment in water control project construction and the reservoir is about 1.6 billion yuan, but we can invest it over two or three five-year plans, and it is still reasonable compared to the benefits we will obtain.

The preliminary design not only conducted extremely thorough research on the safety and economic rationality of the water control project construction but also paid attention to integrating the various parts of the building into a coordinated whole with the surrounding scenery. We have decided to preserve the towering, strangely shaped "dressing table" protruding from the water downstream, and we have asked our artists to decorate it into an expressive artistic sculpture. We will also use the upstream and downstream areas to set up sports fields, lawns, and parks full of flowers and trees, so that the water control project will not only become a magnificent and extremely concise building but also a picturesque scenic area.

Infinite Benefits

The Yellow River is rich in water resources and hydropower resources, and in the past, it was a major disaster for the people. For thousands of years, the Chinese people have wanted to turn the Yellow River's water hazards into water benefits. Jia Rang of the Han Dynasty clearly put forward the idea of "enriching the country and benefiting the people, promoting benefits and eliminating harms" in his three policies for governing the Yellow River. In modern times, the reformist Kang Youwei had the ideal of "I want to level the new giant peaks and sail the blue sea to the source of the great river" in his poem Yong Dizhu at Sanmenxia.... However, due to the limitations of the social system, these could only be dreams. Today, the construction of the Sanmenxia Water Control Project is utilizing the resources of the Yellow River basin at a level incomparably higher than the ideals of river management in the past thousands of years. After the completion of this project, it will inevitably bring huge benefits to the Chinese people.

First, after the completion of the project, 80 million people in the vast plains of Henan, Shandong, Hebei, northern Anhui, and northern Jiangsu can basically avoid the threat of Yellow River floods. The Yellow River floods will no longer breach its banks and inundate the lives and property of the people. After the construction of reservoirs in the Yi River, Luo River, and Qin River, and the success of soil and water conservation upstream, the Yellow River's water hazards will be eradicated. At the same time, because the Yellow River no longer changes its course, the people downstream in the Yellow River basin will be permanently settled and live and work in peace; the Huai River and Hai River systems adjacent to the Yellow River will also be free from the encroachment of the Yellow River, consolidating the achievements in controlling the Huai River and Hai River. It can be said that the construction of the Sanmenxia project and the control of the Yellow River is to eradicate the root cause of water disasters in the entire vast plain north of the Huai River and south of the Hai River.

Second, when the water stored in the reservoir reaches a normal high water level of 360 meters, there will be 19.3 billion cubic meters of water, which can be used to irrigate 40 million mu of farmland in Shandong, Henan, Hebei, and other provinces. It is possible to increase the yield of dry land converted to paddy fields by one or two times; even if the grain yield is increased by 100 jin per mu, it can increase production by 4 billion jin per year. The construction of irrigation canal systems also includes drainage systems, so the irrigation area can not only solve drought but also relieve waterlogging disasters. This is still according to the situation before 1967. In the future, after the construction of the counter-regulating reservoir above Mangshan (storing the water released during the non-irrigation season for power generation for irrigation), it may be possible to irrigate another 30 million mu of farmland downstream. If wells are dug in the middle of the irrigation area, and the diversion of the Yangtze River to the Yellow River is successful, most of the downstream of the entire Yellow River basin may become paddy fields, and the North China Plain will become like Jiangnan. The completion of the Sanmenxia project also provides favorable conditions for such a beautiful vision.

Third, it can also generate 6 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity every year. If one kilowatt-hour of electricity is calculated at 10 cents, the annual income will be 600 million yuan, which is equivalent to increasing the wealth of every person in the country by one yuan. More importantly, with such huge and cheap power, it will be able to promote the industrial development of the area within hundreds of kilometers around Sanmenxia, such as metallurgy industries like aluminum, magnesium, titanium, and copper, the coal industry, the machine manufacturing industry, the textile industry, and other industries, all of which will receive cheap power. At the same time, it also creates favorable conditions for the construction of downstream power stations such as Bali Hutong. The electricity from Sanmenxia will not only be used for industry but also for transportation and agriculture. For example, the western section of the Longhai Railway can be considered for using electric locomotives.

Fourth, the reservoir and the waterway from Zhengzhou to Haikou, nearly 1,000 kilometers long in two sections, can allow 200-ton ships to pass. We know that from Mengjin to near Xi'an, it was almost impossible to navigate in the past, and only sailing ships with small tonnage could barely pass from Zhengzhou to Haikou. After the completion of the water control project, and after the downstream river channel is improved, the above-mentioned waterways can be utilized, which is equivalent to increasing a Longhai Railway, which will have a good effect on the exchange of materials between east and west. At the same time, the irrigation canals of the Yellow River can be used in conjunction with the construction of the North China shipping network. For example, from the upstream of the Zhengzhou Railway Bridge, going north along the Beijing-Hankou line through Shijiazhuang directly to the capital, and south from Shouzhang Weishan to Jining, and north to Linqing, the entire ancient Grand Canal can be restored, so that ships from Hangzhou can reach Beijing via Tianjin. In addition, using the Jialu River to enter the Huai River and then the Yangtze River to reach Shanghai is also a possible route. All of these will be put on the construction agenda due to the completion of the Sanmenxia project and the basic clearing of the Yellow River's muddy waters. I hope that the relevant design departments will give this full consideration.

Fifth, through the construction of the Sanmenxia Water Control Project, a group of skilled personnel will be trained for China's hydraulic engineering construction industry.

In addition to the above five main benefits, fish farming in the reservoir also has good prospects.

In short, the Sanmenxia Water Control Project is great, and this task is glorious. Although we lack experience in building such a large-scale project, and there are still some difficulties in our work, a series of preparations have been made in the past, the design of Soviet experts is very reliable, and all employees have a high enthusiasm for building the Sanmenxia Water Control Project. These are all favorable conditions. As long as we make good use of these conditions, the work tasks of 1957 and the construction of the entire water control project will be successfully completed.

    黄河历史的新的一页
    黄河三门峡工程局副局长　王化云
    黄河三门峡水利枢纽工程，在4月13日正式开工了。三门峡水利枢纽工程是“根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划”中的一项重大工程。这件工程的胜利完成，将为全部实现根治黄河第一期工程奠定巩固的基础。
    三年准备
    三年来，在中央领导、全国人民和苏联人民的支援下，我们进行了巨大的勘测设计和施工准备工作。首先是进行了地形测量、地质勘测、水文泥沙测验等巨大的收集资料的工作，同时从1956年起兴修了一系列的施工准备工程。其次是委托苏联列宁格勒水力发电设计分院进行了水利枢纽和水电站的设计工作，由国内有关部门进行了灌溉设计、支流水库设计、水土保持措施设计、水运设计和水利枢纽辅助工程的设计。在初步设计中，仅列宁格勒设计分院参加此项工作的技术干部就有一千多人，不少专家多次跋山涉水亲自到工地和广大的黄河流域进行了查勘。在1956年4月完成初步设计要点以后，今年1月又完成了研究周密、计算精详、篇幅巨大的初步设计工作。我们对苏联政府、苏联人民的友谊表示衷心感谢。
    自动化的水电站
    整个水利枢纽建筑物，即我们通常所说的拦河大坝，包括溢流坝，右岸的非溢流坝及左岸的非溢流坝三个坝，还有一座水电站。这四部分建筑物连接在一起组成了整个的水利枢纽。
    水电站是整个水利枢纽中的重要部分。初步设计决定在水电站里装置八个机组。每个机组的出力为十三点七五万瓩，八台机组的发电设备容量为一百一十万瓩，年发电六十亿度。
    这个水电站的自动化水平，在达到正常运行的时候，机器房内无人管理，同时把遥控制设在洛阳。为了灵活调动，统一时间计算，在电站内设置有自动电话、无线电探寻信号，三回线的电钟站，无线电转播中心等设施。
    先进的经济指标
    关于水利枢纽的工作量和投资，以及它的经济指标，我们曾同世界上十二个著名的水利工程作了比较，只有两个比三门峡水利枢纽稍好，其余均不及，这说明它的经济指标是良好的。但它的工作量和投资还是巨大的数字，除了我们自己设计的铁路、公路和住宅不计外，土石方的挖填量达一千六百九十一万五千公方，混凝土浇筑量二百九十五万三千公方。总计水利枢纽建筑和水库投资约为十六亿元左右，但是我们可以分作两三个五年计划内来投入，而且和我们将能获得的利益相比还是合理的。
    初步设计中不仅对水利枢纽建筑的安全、经济合理作了极为周密的研究，而且还注意了把建筑物各个部分同周围景物联成一个互相协调的整体。我们决定保存下游高耸出水、形状奇异的梳妆台，请我国的艺术家将它修饰为富于表现力的艺术雕刻品，并且将利用上下游地区设置运动场、草地和满植花木的公园等，使水利枢纽不仅成为一座伟大壮丽、极其简洁的建筑物，而且成为风景如画的风景区。
    无穷的利益
    黄河蕴藏着丰富的水利、水力资源，它在过去曾经是人们的大灾祸。中国人民几千年来都想把黄河水害变为水利。汉朝贾让的治河三策中，明确提出了“富国安民，兴利除害”的见解，近代的改良主义者康有为在三门峡咏砥柱诗中曾有“吾欲铲平新巨嶂，扬帆碧海大河源”的理想……。但是，由于社会制度的限制，这都只能是一种梦想。今天，三门峡水利枢纽的兴修，是在比过去几千年来治河理想高得不可比拟的水平上，来充分利用黄河流域的资源。这项工程完成以后，必然给我国人民带来巨大的利益。
    第一，工程完成以后，河南、山东、河北、皖北和苏北等地大平原上的八千万人民，可以基本上避免遭受黄河洪水的威胁。黄河洪水再也不能决堤泛滥，吞没人民的生命财产。在伊河、洛河、沁河兴修水库，上游水土保持获得成功以后，黄河水患就会根除。同时，由于黄河不再改道，黄河流域的下游人民将获得永远的安居乐业；邻接黄河的淮河和海河水系，也免除了黄河的侵袭，使根治淮河和海河的成就得到巩固。可以说，兴修三门峡工程，治理黄河，是铲除淮河以北海河以南整个大平原上的水灾祸根。
    第二，水库蓄存的水，当正常高水位达到三百六十公尺时，有一百九十三亿公方的水，可以用以灌溉山东、河南、河北等省的四千万亩农田。旱田改为水地，增产一、二倍是可能的；即按每亩增产粮食一百斤计算，一年便能增产四十亿斤。在兴修灌溉渠系中还包括排水系统，所以灌区内不仅可以解决旱灾，还可以解除内涝灾害。这还是照1967年以前的情况说的，将来邙山以上的反调节水库（蓄存非灌溉季节发电放下来的水再用于灌溉）兴修以后，下游还可能再多灌溉农田三千万亩。如果灌区中间加凿水井，引江济黄获得成功，整个黄河流域的下游便可能绝大部分变为水田，华北平原就成了江南。三门峡工程的完成，也为这样美丽的远景提供了有利的条件。
    第三，每年还能发电六十亿度。如果一度电按一角钱计算，每年收入六亿元，等于为全国人民每一个人增加一元钱的财富。更重要的是，由于有了这样巨大而低廉的电力，就能够推动三门峡周围几百公里内地区的工业发展，例如铝、镁、钛、铜等冶金工业，煤炭工业，机器制造工业，纺织工业和其他工业，都将得到廉价动力。同时，它也为下游八里胡同等电站的兴修创造了有利条件。三门峡的电，不仅用于工业，还要用于交通运输业和农业，例如陇海路西段就可以考虑改用电气牵引机车。
    第四，水库和郑州至海口两段长近一千公里的水道，可以通行二百吨的轮船。我们知道从孟津到西安附近，过去几乎可以说不能通航，郑州至海口也仅能勉强通行吨位不大的帆船。水利枢纽完成，下游河道经过整理以后，上述航道就可以利用，这等于增加了一条陇海铁路，对东西方向的物资交流将有良好作用。同时，还可以利用黄河灌溉的干渠，结合考虑华北的航运网的建设，例如由郑州铁桥上游向北沿京汉线经过石家庄直达首都，由寿张位山南通济宁，北达临清，把古代的大运河全部恢复，使杭州的船只能够经天津到达北京。另外，利用贾鲁河经过淮河进入长江到达上海，也是一条可能的航线。这些都将由三门峡工程的建成，黄河浊流的基本变清，而被提上建设议程。我希望有关的设计部门对此予以充分的考虑。
    第五，通过三门峡水利枢纽的建设，将为我国水工建筑事业培养一批熟练人材。
    除了上述五个方面的主要利益以外，水库养鱼也有很好的前景。
    总之，三门峡水利枢纽工程是伟大的，这个任务是光荣的。尽管我们建筑这样大规模的工程，还缺乏经验，工作上还有一些困难。但是，过去已经进行了一系列的准备工作，苏联专家的设计十分可靠，全体职工建设三门峡水利枢纽的热情很高，这都是有利的条件。我们只要很好地利用这些条件，1957年的工作任务和整个水利枢纽的建设一定会胜利完成。（附图片）
