    It is Encouragement, and also a Spur
    Li Yingmin
    In this excellent film award, "South Island Storm" was included in the list of winners. As the screenwriter of this film, my heart is filled with excitement. The state's reward is a great encouragement and support to me.
    During the hard years of the war, I lived with the soldiers fighting on Hainan Island in uninhabited mountains and forests. Without oil lamps, without quilts, in the cold night, we lit bonfires and slept beside them. Before going to bed, everyone always liked to tell stories, and they had to take turns, not just "listen for free." At the request of the soldiers, I told stories about the "25,000-Li Long March," "Chapayev," "The Iron Flood," and "The Rout," and also fragments of "Water Margin" and "Romance of the Three Kingdoms." The soldiers liked to listen very much, sometimes until late at night they were reluctant to sleep. I remember once, after I finished telling a story, a young soldier asked curiously: "Did you hear these stories or read them in books?" I said I read them in books, and told him that I had also seen the film made based on the book "Chapayev." The young soldier said after listening: "How great it would be if our stories could be written into books and made into movies!" A nurse sitting next to me then asked: "Can you write books?" I was asked with a red face, and had to say: "I can't write, but someone will definitely write in the future."
    More than ten years have passed, and of the comrades-in-arms who told and listened to stories beside the bonfire, only a few remain; but every time I remember this life, remember the bright, hopeful eyes of that young soldier, I always feel like I owe a debt. After liberation, I sometimes thought about writing something, but I didn't know where to start, always hoping that an enthusiastic writer would appear on Hainan Island, and I would be willing to be a "researcher" for him.
    My wish was finally discovered by the Party, but the Party did not send me a writer, but gave me time and all the conditions to realize this wish.
    For someone who has never written literary works, writing a decent article, especially writing a literary script for filming, is not a simple matter. The creation of the "South Island Storm" script should thank the Party for its support and help. When I started writing, I realized the difficulty of creation and the pain of failure. A newly enlisted soldier who has been defeated is more likely to waver than an old soldier, and even wants to desert. But when I was most in pain, the Party extended a hand to me. Responsible comrades of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the South China Branch of the Communist Party of China participated in my writing discussion meetings several times, analyzed the reasons for my failure, and found the strength to continue writing from me; and in terms of creative methods and the selection of topics, the Party also repeatedly inspired and helped me. After the first draft of "South Island Storm" was written, the Party first affirmed it, but also put forward strict requirements, thus giving me the confidence to revise and rewrite it again and again.
      The literary script of "South Island Storm" was written with the support and help of the Party.
      When the film "South Island Storm" appeared in front of the audience, it was the result of the hard work of the director, actors, cinematographers, and all the comrades of the film crew. It was their artistic talents that enriched, developed, and supplemented the original script. If "South Island Storm" has achieved anything, it should be attributed to all the creative staff. I only accepted the entrustment of the young soldier mentioned above and provided the materials.
      "South Island Storm" is the first step in my creative life. After taking the first step, I feel that my shoulders are not lighter, but heavier.
    Not long after "South Island Storm" was released, I returned to Hainan Island to visit my old comrades-in-arms and fellow villagers. As soon as we met, we talked enthusiastically about this film. The members of an agricultural production cooperative in Qiongshan County were able to tell the story of the film from beginning to end. They said in unison: "Old Li, you have done a good thing, you have finally not eaten the rice of the people of Hainan in vain." At the same time, they also felt unsatisfied and criticized me for writing too little, "If you don't write about things you are familiar with, who should write them?" They told me orally or in letters that there were more than a dozen topics they wanted me to write about.
    Not only did the people of Hainan Island criticize and urge me like this, but in the past year, I have been to many provinces and cities in East China, Central South, and Northwest China, and the people there have also made their demands, hoping that film and television scriptwriters can bring their boiling lives to the screen.
    This film award is an encouragement and also a spur to me. I am willing, as an amateur creator, to further improve my ideological and artistic level, and use every minute I can to write more and better works for the people who are building our great motherland.

    是鼓励，也是督促
    李英敏
    在这次优秀影片评奖中，“南岛风云”被列入得奖名单里，作为这部影片的编剧，我的内心充满了激动。国家的奖励，对我说来，是极大的鼓舞和支持。
    在战争的艰苦岁月里，我和战斗在海南岛上的战士们住在渺无人烟的山林中。没有油灯、没有被盖，在寒冷的黑夜，我们生起篝火，在篝火旁边睡觉。睡觉前大伙总喜欢讲故事，而且要轮流讲，不准“白听”。在战士们的要求下，我讲过“二万五千里长征”、“夏伯阳”、“铁流”和“毁灭”，也讲过“水浒传”和“三国演义”的片段。战士们很喜欢听，有时听到深夜还不肯睡。记得有一次，在我讲完一段故事以后，一位年青的战士好奇地问道：“你讲的故事是听来的还是从书本上看来的。”我说是从书本上看来的，并且告诉他，我还看过根据“夏伯阳”这部书拍成的电影。这位年青的战士听了说：“我们的事情要能写成书，拍成电影，该多好呀！”坐在我身旁的一位看护员接着问我：“你会不会写书？”我被问得满脸通红，只好说：“我不会写，但将来一定有人写的。”
    时间已经过去十多年了，在篝火旁边讲故事听故事的战友们，存留下来的只是很少的几个人；但每次记起这段生活，记起那位年青战士发亮的充满热望的眼睛，自己总好像欠下一笔账。解放后，有时也想写点东西，但又不知从何写起，总希望有位热心的作家出现在海南岛，我愿意为他做个“资料员”。
    我的愿望终于给党发现了，但党并没有给我派来一位作家，而是给我时间和一切条件，要我实现这个愿望。
    一个完全没有写过文艺作品的人，要写出一篇像样的文章，特别是要写出一个供拍摄影片用的文学剧本来，那不是简单的事。“南岛风云”剧本的产生，应该感谢党给我的支持和帮助。当我开始写作的时候，就体会到了创作的困难、失败的痛苦。一个新入伍的战士打了败仗，比老战士更容易动摇，甚至想开小差。但当我最痛苦的时候，党向我伸出手来。中共中央宣传部和中共华南分局的负责同志几次参加我的写作讨论会，为我分析失败的原因，从我的身上找出了可以写下去的力量；而在创作方法上，题材的选择上，党也一再启发帮助我。当“南岛风云”初稿写出来以后，党首先肯定了它，同时也提出了严格的要求，因而使我有信心一遍二遍三遍地修改重写。
      “南岛风云”文学剧本就是在党的支持和帮助下写出来的。
      “南岛风云”这部影片出现在观众面前时，更是经过导演、演员、摄影师和摄制组全体同志们艰辛劳动的结果，是他们的艺术才能丰富了、发展了、充实了原有的剧本。如果说“南岛风云”有所成就的话，应该归功于全体创作人员，我不过是接受上面所说那位年青战士的付托，把素材提供出来而已。
      “南岛风云”是我的创作生活开始的第一步，迈开第一步以后，我觉得自己的肩上不是轻松了，而是更加沉重了。
    “南岛风云”上演后不久，我曾回到海南岛去，拜访旧日的战友们和乡亲们。一见面总是热烈地谈着这部影片。琼山县一个农业生产合作社的社员们能够把影片故事从头说到尾。他们异口同声地说：“老李，你做了一件好事，总算没白吃海南人民的大米。”同时，他们也感到不满足，批评我写的太少了，“你熟识的东西不写，该谁来写？”他们口头或写信告诉我，要我写的题材就有十多个。
    不但是海南岛人民这样批评督促我，一年来，我到过华东、中南和西北许多省市，那些地方的人民也提出他们的要求，希望电影剧作者能把他们沸腾的生活搬上银幕。
    这次影片的评奖，对我是鼓励，也是督促，我愿以业余创作者的身份，更进一步提高思想水平和艺术水平，利用每分钟可以利用的时间，为建设我们伟大祖国的人们，写出更多更好的作品来。
