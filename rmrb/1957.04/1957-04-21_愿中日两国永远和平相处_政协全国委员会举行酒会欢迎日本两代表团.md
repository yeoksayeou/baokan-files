Xinhua News Agency, April 20th. The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) held a reception at the CPPCC Auditorium tonight to welcome the Japanese Socialist Party Goodwill Mission to China, headed by Inejiro Asanuma, and the Japanese Women's Delegation to China, headed by Katsumi Kubushiro.

    Zhou Enlai, Chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, frequently toasted and chatted cordially with the guests.

    A group of Japanese reporters asked Zhou Enlai to say a few words to the Japanese people.

    Zhou Enlai said that the Japanese people love peace, which is very beneficial to Asia and Africa, and therefore welcomed by the people of all countries. The Chinese people wholeheartedly support every peaceful action of the Japanese people. Zhou Enlai said that the people of China and Japan should not only restore historical friendly traditions, but also develop friendly relations on a new basis. He said that the people of China and Japan share a common desire for complete national independence, and therefore it is possible to enhance new friendship on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

    Zhou Enlai said that he believes that the Japanese people, who have a tradition of independence for thousands of years, will surely achieve their desire for independence, and that the Japanese people, who have national self-confidence and self-esteem, will surely respect their own traditions.

    Zhou Enlai wished the Japanese people happiness and new success in their cause of national independence and peace.

    Zhou Enlai added, may China and Japan be friends forever and live in peace forever, and may the two countries truly coexist and prosper together. He said that this kind of coexistence and common prosperity is based on equality and mutual benefit, and neither excludes nor harms the interests of other countries.

    Dong Biwu, Vice-Chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, delivered a speech at the beginning of the reception, extending a warm welcome to the Japanese guests. Dong Biwu said: We admire the contributions made by the Japanese people in safeguarding peace and democracy. We sincerely hope that the Japanese Socialist Party will achieve further success in striving for Japan's complete independence, opposing atomic weapons, safeguarding world peace, and restoring Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations; we sincerely hope that Japanese women will achieve new success in their struggle for peace, Sino-Japanese friendship, and the welfare of Japanese women and children.

    Inejiro Asanuma and Katsumi Kubushiro spoke successively, expressing their gratitude for the warm hospitality of the hosts.

    Inejiro Asanuma said: The purpose of our visit to China this time is to normalize Sino-Japanese relations as soon as possible. Today we feel that this issue does not lie with China, but with Japan and the United States, so we are prepared to launch a national movement after returning to Japan to strive for the restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries.

    Inejiro Asanuma said that there is an old saying in Japan: "A near neighbor is better than a distant relative." But the reality is: Japan has abandoned China, which is not only a "near neighbor" but also a "close relative," and has formed a relationship with people far away. He said: We are willing to work hard to enhance this kinship and brotherly relationship between Japan and China.

    Katsumi Kubushiro said: We have heard at home that New China has made further progress in all aspects. After coming to China, we have personally confirmed this fact. We have seen that 600 million Chinese people are working hard to build their own country. She expressed that in the future, Japanese women will work together with everyone to enhance the friendship between the people of China and Japan and world peace.

    The reception ended with the Japanese Women's Delegation singing "Tokyo-Beijing."

    Among those who attended the reception tonight were Li Jishen, Guo Moruo, Shen Junru, Chen Shutong, and Zhang Bojun, Vice-Chairmen of the CPPCC National Committee, Xing Xiping, Secretary-General, Standing Committee members and female members, Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, Zhou Gengsheng, Qiao Guanhua, and Luo Longji, Vice-Presidents, Li Dequan, Xu Guangping, and Shi Liang, Vice-Chairmen of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, and famous figures from all walks of life in the capital.

    愿中日两国永远和平相处
    政协全国委员会举行酒会欢迎日本两代表团
    新华社20日讯　中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会今天晚上在政协礼堂举行酒会，欢迎以浅沼稻次郎为首的日本社会党访华亲善使节团和以久布白落实为首的日本妇女访华代表团。
    政协全国委员会主席周恩来同客人们一起频频干杯，亲切叙谈。
    一群日本记者请周恩来向日本人民讲几句话。
    周恩来说，日本人民是爱好和平的，这是对亚洲和非洲都是非常有利的，所以受到各国人民的欢迎。中国人民全心全意支持日本人民的每一个和平行动。周恩来说，日中两国人民不仅要恢复历史上的友好传统，而且应该在新的基础上发展友好关系。他说，中日两国人民对民族完全独立具有共同愿望，因此，就有可能在和平共处五项原则的基础上，增进新的友谊。
    周恩来说，相信具有几千年独立传统的日本人民，一定能达到他们的独立愿望，具有民族自信心和自尊心的日本人民一定会尊重他们自己的传统。
    周恩来祝日本人民幸福，祝日本人民在为民族独立和和平事业方面获得新的成功。
    周恩来又说，愿中日两国永远友好，永远和平相处，愿两国真正共存共荣。他说，这种共存共荣是平等互利的，是既不排除也不损害其他国家利益的。
    政协全国委员会副主席董必武在酒会开始时讲话，向日本客人表示热烈欢迎。董必武说：我们很钦佩日本人民在维护和平、民主方面所作的贡献。我们衷心地希望日本社会党在争取日本完全独立，在反对原子武器，在维护世界和平，在恢复中日邦交等方面都获得进一步的成就；我们衷心地希望日本妇女在为和平，为中日友好，为日本妇女儿童的福利所作的奋斗获得新的成就。
    浅沼稻次郎和久布白落实先后讲话，都对主人的盛情招待，表示感谢。
    浅沼稻次郎说：我们这次访问中国的目的，是为了日中两国邦交早日正常化。今天我们已感到这个问题不在于中国，而在于日本和美国，所以我们准备回日本后开展一个国民运动，为恢复两国的邦交而努力。
    浅沼稻次郎说，日本有一句古话：“远亲不如近邻。”但是现实情况却是：日本放弃了不仅是“近邻”而且是“近亲”的中国，而同远方的人结成了关系。他说：我们愿为增进日中两国这种亲戚和兄弟的关系而努力。
    久布白落实说：我们在国内就听说新中国在各方面都有了进一步的发展，来到中国后，我们亲眼证实了这个事实，我们看到中国六亿人民都在为着建设自己的国家而努力。她表示，今后日本妇女将和大家一起为增进中日两国人民友好和世界和平而努力。
    酒会在日本妇女访华代表团歌唱“东京——北京”声中结束。
    参加今晚酒会的，有中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席李济深、郭沫若、沈钧儒、陈叔通、章伯钧，秘书长邢西萍、常务委员和女委员，中国人民外交学会会长张奚若，副会长周鲠生、乔冠华、罗隆基，中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席李德全、许广平、史良和首都各界著名人士等。（附图片）
