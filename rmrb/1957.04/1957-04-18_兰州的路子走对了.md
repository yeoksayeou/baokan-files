Less Money, More Results

    Lanzhou's Path is the Right One
    Chen Jun

    The approach taken by Lanzhou City, as reported in today's newspaper, regarding the development of service industries, is worthy of everyone's consideration.

    Lanzhou's approach tells people: the same thing can be done by spending more money, or by spending less; spending more money can get things done, and spending less money can also get things done; sometimes it can even get things done better. With the development of industrial construction, Lanzhou City has experienced a sharp increase in population. Like many other large cities, its service industries have not kept up with the needs of the people, and many tense situations have emerged, with going to the theater or cinema being one of them. In 1954, more than 700,000 yuan was spent here to build a People's Theater with only one thousand seats. In the past two years, more than 300,000 yuan has been spent to build six cinemas and theaters, increasing the number of seats by more than five thousand, and providing cinemas and theaters for the three newly expanded urban areas. Let us calculate: if the more than 700,000 yuan used to build the People's Theater in 1954 had been used to build cinemas and theaters costing 20,000 to 30,000 yuan each, wouldn't the same amount of money have been used to build twenty or thirty more cinemas and theaters? If these cinemas and theaters were reasonably distributed throughout the city, especially in the new industrial areas, wouldn't that satisfy the people's desire to go to the theater or cinema? Of course, sitting on leather chairs in the People's Theater is more comfortable than sitting on wooden chairs, but when we consider that sitting on leather chairs can only allow a thousand people to see movies and plays, while sitting on wooden chairs can solve the urgent needs of the city's people, the mass viewpoint will naturally guide us to face the majority of people. As long as we proceed from reality and from the point of view of serving the people, the same amount of money can be used more appropriately.

    This matter also tells people: many things directly related to the daily life of the masses can be done by the state, or more methods can be devised to do them; it is certainly good to have the state do them, but many things cannot necessarily be done quickly, and if they are forced to be done, it will affect the construction of key projects. If funds are raised locally, using trade union funds, factory director funds, self-managed theater troupes, or mass fundraising, the enthusiasm and potential of the local areas and the masses can be brought into play, promoting the development of the entire construction. Lanzhou is a key construction city that requires state investment, but the state's funds are limited. If more is used on this matter, less will be used on another matter, and there will naturally be a distinction between priorities. In the past few years, in addition to the investment used in Lanzhou's key projects, the state has also spent a considerable amount of funds to build residential dormitories, water plants, and sewers. However, with the improvement of people's living standards, people not only demand solutions to the problems of food, clothing, housing, and transportation, but also want to go to the theater and cinema, send their children to school, and pay attention to hygiene. All these good things should be done, but the state cannot do them all at the same time; and if many things are not done, and attention is not paid to appropriately meeting the needs of the people, it will affect people's lives and the progress of construction. Lanzhou City's adoption of methods such as local fundraising, mass fundraising, and self-construction by theater troupes to build five or six cinemas and theaters powerfully demonstrates that some things that the state does not currently have the strength to do can also be done by relying on the enthusiasm of the masses and the potential of the local areas. At the same time, precisely because they are done by relying on the masses, these undertakings are done more in line with reality and the needs of the masses.

    Lanzhou City's path is the right one. If we continue to do things in this direction, the many existing livelihood problems can certainly be gradually resolved, greatly contributing to the development of the city. However, before embarking on this path, Lanzhou also experienced some troubles. On the one hand, the demands of the masses were urgent, and on the other hand, in the early stage of construction, the state could not and should not use a large amount of investment in this area. But the problem had to be solved. Difficulties forced it to find another way out.

    Is there anything new about Lanzhou City's method of solving the people's need to go to the theater or cinema? Building simple theaters and cinemas is not a new thing in Lanzhou. Even now, you can still find old theaters with only a reed canopy, surrounded by half-cut earthen walls or wooden fences, and there are still theater troupes performing, and there are many spectators. However, why, for a long period, under the pressure of the people's urgent need to go to the theater or cinema, did no one think of building this type of simple cinema and theater? Moreover, in any work, having a mass viewpoint, being diligent and thrifty, is not unfamiliar to communists! Why, in the process of building socialism, have these fine traditions been "shelved"? The reason is that many people have been blinded by victory, as if after the victory of the revolution, we have no problems. When we think of construction, we must "modernize" everything and make everything "look the part," without considering our country's current conditions, and striving for perfection and novelty in everything. To build theaters and cinemas, we only consider high-rise buildings, magnificent structures, velvet curtains, inverted chandeliers, and heating and cooling to keep warm in winter and cool in summer, and there must be a lounge for smoking and drinking tea. If it does not meet this standard, or does not conform to long-term planning, we disdain to build it. As for the tens of thousands of people anxiously waiting to see movies and plays, it is not taken into consideration. From then on, the mass viewpoint was replaced by impractical and excessively high standards, and the fine tradition of hard work and simplicity was replaced by a luxurious atmosphere of pursuing "looking the part." Many problems that could be appropriately solved have not been solved for a long time, unconsciously separating ourselves from the masses and deviating from the principles of hard work and simplicity and building the country and running all undertakings with diligence and thrift. The simple cinemas and theaters built by Lanzhou City have used facts to criticize this subjective idealism of seeking novelty and grandeur and being impractical. This is significant for the construction work of many cities across the country.

    Since the problem of theaters and cinemas can be solved by the method adopted by Lanzhou, what about other problems? If there are not enough dormitories and residences, can the current cost standards be appropriately lowered, saving money to build more dormitories and residences? Can the method of self-construction with public assistance be promoted? If it is inconvenient to buy things, can we build fewer high-rise department stores and more simple shopping malls? If there are not enough middle schools and primary schools, can we make the scale of the schools smaller and develop community-run and publicly assisted primary schools? A long list of such questions can still be raised. And wouldn't such an approach be more in line with the policy of building the country with diligence and thrift and running all undertakings with diligence and thrift?

    Of course, this approach does not mean that we are satisfied with simplicity or are willing to make things "not look the part," but rather that we proceed from reality and act according to our capabilities. We all believe that in ten, twenty, thirty or fifty years, with the development of the economy and the prosperity of the country, we will have better theaters, cinemas, and residences year by year. However, we cannot treat the long-term vision as the current construction plan, and we cannot use the standards of socialism or even communism as the standard of today's life before we have completed the construction of socialism. Otherwise, we will inevitably become detached from reality and the masses, violate the policy of building the country with diligence and thrift and running all undertakings with diligence and thrift, create many avoidable wastes, and cause many unnecessary tensions. Facing the masses and relying on the masses is an indispensable mass viewpoint in construction.

### 兰州的路子走对了

专栏：少花钱多办事

    兰州的路子走对了
    陈浚
    今天报上报道的兰州市发展服务性行业的作法，值得大家都来想一想。
    兰州的作法告诉人们：办同样的事，可以多花钱，也可以少花钱；多花钱，可以办事，少花钱，同样也可以办事；有时候还会把事情办得更好。兰州市随着工业建设的发展，人口骤增，同别的许多大城市一样，服务性行业赶不上人民的需要，出现了许多紧张情况，看戏看电影也是其中的一项。1954年，这里花七十多万元修建了一座人民剧院，只有一千个座位；近两年里，花了三十几万元，修建了六座影剧院，却增加了五千多个座位，并且使三个新扩展的市区有了影剧院。让我们来算一下，如果把1954年修建人民剧院的七十多万元，用来修建二、三万元一座的影剧院，岂不是用同样多的钱，就可以多盖二、三十座影剧院吗？如果把这些影剧院合理分布在全市，特别是新工业区，岂不是可以满足人民看戏看电影的要求了吗？当然，坐在人民剧院的皮椅子上，比起坐木椅子来会舒服些，可是，当我们考虑到，坐皮椅子只能使一千人看到电影和戏，坐木椅子可以解决全市人民的迫切要求的时候，群众观点，自然而然会指导我们面向大多数人的。只要从实际出发，从为人民群众服务的观点出发，同样数目的钱就可以用得更加得当。
    这一件事情还告诉人们：有许多直接关系到群众日常生活的事情，可以由国家办，也可以想出更多的方法来办；由国家办，固然很好，但是许多事情不一定能很快地办起来，如果硬要办，就会影响重点工程的建设。如果由地方自筹，利用工会经费、厂长基金、剧团自办或者群众集资，便可以发挥地方和群众的积极性和潜力，推动整个建设的发展。兰州是重点建设的一个城市，要由国家投资，不过国家的资金是有限的，用在这件事上多些，用在另一件事情上的就会少些，自然有轻重缓急之分。几年来，国家除了用在兰州重点工程上的投资以外，也还用了不少的款项，修建住宅宿舍、自来水厂、上下水道等。但是，随着人民生活水平的提高，人们不仅要求解决衣食住行的问题，还要求看戏看电影，让子女上学，要讲卫生。所有这些好事，都是应该办的，但是，国家不可能同时都办起来；而许多事情不办起来，不去注意适当满足人民的需要，就会影响人民生活，影响建设的进展。兰州市采用地方自筹、群众集资、剧团自建等办法，建立起五、六座影剧院，有力地说明了有些国家眼前没有力量办的事，依靠群众的积极性和地方的潜力，也是可以办起来的。同时，正由于是依靠群众办的，这些事业办得就更加合乎实际，合乎群众的需要。
    兰州市的路走对了，照着这个方向办下去，目前存在的许多生活问题，可以肯定地说，能够逐步得到解决，大大有助于城市的发展。然而在走出这条路之前，兰州也有过一番烦恼。一方面群众的要求迫不及待，另一方面在建设初期国家不可能也不应当把大量的投资用在这一方面。但是问题又非解决不可。困难迫使它不得不另找出路。
    兰州市解决人民看戏看电影的办法，有什么新奇之处吗？关于修建简易的剧院影院，在兰州并不是新鲜的事。直到现在，还可以找到只有一个席顶棚，围着半截土墙或者木栅栏的旧剧场，并且一直有剧团在演出，观众也不少。可是，为什么在很长的期间里，在人民迫切要求看戏看电影的压力下，竟会想不到修建这一类简朴的影剧院呢？而且在任何工作中，要有群众观点，克勤克俭，对于共产党人来说，也不是生疏的啊！为什么在建设社会主义事业的过程中，这些优良的传统，都“窝工”了呢？道理就在于许多人被胜利冲昏了头脑，好像革命胜利了，我们什么都不成问题了。一想到建设，就必然要处处“现代化”，事事搞得“像个样子”，不考虑我国现在的条件，样样都求全求新。要建剧院和电影院，考虑的只是高楼大厦，富丽堂皇，金丝绒幕布，倒挂式花灯，暖气冷气能冬暖夏凉，吸烟喝茶要有休息室。不够这个标准，不合长远规划，就不屑去修建。至于几十万人焦急地等着看电影看戏，却不在考虑之列。从此，群众观点被不切实际的过高标准所代替，艰苦朴素的优良传统被追求“像样子”的奢华风气所代替。许多能够适当解决的问题，长期得不到解决，不自觉地脱离了群众，离开了艰苦朴素和勤俭建国、勤俭办一切事业的原则。兰州市修建的简朴影剧院，用事实批判了这种求新求大，不切实际的主观主义。这一点，对于全国许多城市的建设工作来讲，都是有意义的。
    既然剧院影院可以用兰州采取的办法来解决，那么，其他方面的问题呢？宿舍住宅不够，是不是可以适当降低现行造价标准，省下钱来，建筑更多的宿舍住宅呢？是不是可以推广自建公助的办法呢？买东西不方便，是不是可以少盖一些高层建筑的百货大楼，多建一些简易的商场呢？中学、小学不够，是不是可以把学校的规模搞得小一些，发展民办公助的小学呢？这一类问题，还可以提出一大串。而这样的做法，岂不是更加符合于勤俭建国，勤俭办一切事业的方针吗？
    当然，这种做法，绝不是我们满足于简陋，愿意搞得“不像样子”，而是从实际出发，量力而行。我们人人都会相信，十年，二十年，三、五十年以后，随着经济的发展，国家的繁荣，我们会有一年比一年好的剧院、影院和住宅。但是，我们不能把远景当成现在的建设计划，我们不能在没有完成社会主义的建设以前，用社会主义甚至共产主义的标准来作为今天生活的标准，否则，势必脱离现实，脱离群众，违背勤俭建国、勤俭办一切事业的方针，造成许多可以避免的浪费，引起许多可以不发生的紧张。面向群众，依靠群众，是建设中必不可缺的群众观点。
