An Idler in the Agricultural Cooperative
Wang Xueqin Liang Bin

Huang Hechang has been an idler in the countryside for over a year.

He went to the countryside on the eve of the high tide of the agricultural cooperation movement in July 1955, carrying a backpack—and also carrying the ideological baggage of pursuing personal fame and status.

He arrived at the First Agricultural Production Cooperative in Longshui Township, a key cooperative in Xinhui County, Guangdong Province. The members were very enthusiastic about him, found a house for him to settle down in, and hoped he would help them run the cooperative well. However, he had his own ideas, believing that he had done revolutionary work for several years and had finally become the finance director of the Xinhui County Federation of Trade Unions. Now, being transferred to the countryside was a “demotion.” So he went on strike. After arriving at the cooperative, he didn't ask about production. He listened to the radio during the day, read novels at night, and didn't get up until after nine in the morning. He was too lazy to attend the cooperative's production meetings. If others came to invite him, he would definitely ask who sent them. If it was the district committee secretary or the township party branch secretary who called him, he would have no choice but to go. If it was a general cadre who called him, he would simply ignore them. When he arrived at the meeting, others would be discussing things enthusiastically, but he would look down at the newspaper without saying a word. Once, Liao Jiangsen, the township party branch secretary, discovered that a section of the dike in Gangkou showed signs of collapse and asked him to mobilize the cooperative members to repair it. However, he didn't take it to heart. As a result, the dike collapsed, and more than 20 mu of paddy fields were flooded. Afterwards, he still quibbled and said: "I am just a resident cadre in the cooperative, here to assist you in production. If something goes wrong, the responsibility should fall on you." Another time, rice blast occurred, and the cooperative director told him to immediately organize the cooperative members to spray medicine in the fields, but he ignored it. As a result, the rice blast spread, affecting the cooperative's increase in production. In nearly a year in Longshui Township, he did not come up with any good ideas for the cooperative. The township cadres therefore complained to the higher authorities, expressing that they did not welcome this idler. The higher authorities then transferred him away.

After the summer harvest last year, the district sent a work team to the reduced-production cooperatives to consolidate the cooperatives. Huang Hechang set off with them and was assigned to Taling Township. As in the past, he didn't care about any work, sleeping in the township people's committee, eating in the supply and marketing cooperative, and finding people to play chess during the day. After staying in the township for a long time, he felt bored and went to the district to find the district committee secretary, saying, "Hey! I have a terrible headache, I simply can't work. Let me go to the Huicheng Town clinic for treatment!" The district committee secretary felt that it was a long way from the district to Huicheng Town, and it was inconvenient to travel back and forth. The district had a health center, so he asked him to see a doctor at the district office. Huang Hechang left dissatisfied. However, that same night, people saw him in the Huicheng Town theater, watching a movie with great energy.

In order to help Huang Hechang, the higher authorities specially gave him more than half a month off after the autumn harvest last year, allowing him to leave his post and study the "Eighth National Congress" documents in the county. Then, they sent him to work in the Fourth Agricultural Cooperative in Jibei Township, hoping that he could correct his mistakes this time.

Yu Shelai, the director of the Fourth Agricultural Cooperative in Jibei Township, was very happy to see Huang Hechang. It turned out that during the land reform, Huang Hechang had been a cadre here, an activist who never flinched from catching spies and fighting local bullies. Therefore, Yu Shelai respected him very much. However, Huang Hechang did not appreciate this kindness. All he considered were his own status, treatment, etc., and he had no intention of doing a good job. On the second day of arriving at the cooperative, he asked to eat at the Liyuchong Elementary School in the township.

There was a teacher at Liyuchong Elementary School who had been Huang Hechang's student in the past. One day, the two compared the level of their compensation. Huang Hechang had been a middle school teacher in the past, and he had joined the revolutionary work earlier than the elementary school teacher, but the result of the comparison was that his salary was only ten yuan more than the elementary school teacher. He was therefore filled with emotion.

Huang Hechang was "still the same as before" in the Fourth Cooperative of Jibei Township, not doing any work. He was always two or three hours late for cooperative meetings. When he arrived, he would habitually sit aside and read novels. Sometimes the cooperative cadres felt that he was too outrageous and advised him, "Comrade Huang, what schemes are you thinking about all day, and what news are you reading? Why are you like this?" Yu Shelai often reminded him, "Running a cooperative is not child's play. Whether it is run well or badly affects the lives of hundreds of people!" But these criticisms did not arouse his sense of responsibility for the socialist cause. He hid in the elementary school all day, and it was difficult for the cooperative members to find him in the cooperative. After the Spring Festival this year, although the county leaders proposed that cadres should go deep into the grassroots and take the lead in production, Huang Hechang still did not ask about the cooperative's production. Only when inspecting production did the cooperative director personally invite him to the school, and he was too embarrassed to refuse. The cooperative director asked him several times what opinions he had on the cooperative's production plan, but he always answered irrelevantly: "The plan is 70% reality, and 30% depends on enthusiasm." Apart from these two inexplicable remarks, he couldn't offer any other opinions.

People are very concerned about Huang Hechang and always hope that he will correct his mistakes. Whether in Longshui Township, Taling Township, or Jibei Township, the township party branch and the cooperative cadres often gave him advice and helped him, believing that he had a certain amount of mass work experience and education, and that he could do the work well. The township cadres who participated in the land reform with him back then felt very sorry to see him lying still now, sinking deeper and deeper into the quagmire of individualism. Now the cadres in Jibei Township are still looking forward to Huang Hechang's transformation, and everyone is still helping him. However, to pull back from the brink, it is even more important for him to wake up and make an effort himself.

    农业社里的一个闲人
    汪学勤　梁彬
    黄和昌在农村里已经做了一年多的闲人。
    他是在1955年7月农业合作化运动高潮的前夕背着背包——同时也背着追求个人名誉、地位的思想包袱下乡的。
    他到了泷水乡第一农业生产合作社，这是广东省新会县的重点社。社员对他很热情，找了房子让他安居下来，希望他帮助他们把社办好。可是他另有一套想法，认为自己干了几年革命工作，好容易当上新会县工会联合会的财务负责人，这下子给调到农村，岂不是“低了一级”？于是就实行怠工。到社以后，不问生产，白天听听收音机，晚上看看小说，早晨九点多钟还不起床。社里召开生产会议，他懒得参加。别人来请，他必定先问明是谁叫的。如果是区委书记或者乡的党支部书记叫的，他才不得不去。要是一般干部叫的，他就索性不理。到了会，别人讨论得烘烘热热，他却低头看报，一声不响。有一次，乡的党支部书记廖江森发现岗口一段堤围有下塌迹象，请他动员社员抢修。可是，他没有放在心里。结果堤围被冲崩，淹死了二十多亩禾田。事后他还强词夺理地说：“我只是一个驻社干部，是来协助你们搞生产的。出了事，责任应归你们。”又有一次，发生了稻热病，社主任告诉他要马上组织社员到田里喷射药物，他也不理会。结果稻热病蔓延开来了，影响了社的增产。他在泷水乡将近一年，没有给社出过什么好主意。乡干部因此向上级提意见，表示不欢迎这个闲人。上级于是把他调走。
      去年夏收后，区里派出工作组到减产社去进行巩固社的工作，黄和昌随同出发了，他被分派到塔岭乡。也还像过去一样，他什么工作都不管，在乡人民委员会睡觉，在供销合作社吃饭，白天找人下棋。在乡里呆得久了，觉得厌烦，便到区里找区委书记，说：“哎！我头痛得很厉害，简直没办法工作了，让我到会城镇诊疗吧！”区委书记觉得从区里到会城镇很远，往返不便，区里有卫生所，于是叫他就在区公所找医生看病。黄和昌不大满意地走了。可是，当天晚上，人们却在会城镇的戏院里看到他精神奕奕地在看电影。
    上级为了帮助黄和昌，去年秋收后，特地给他半个多月的时间，让他离职到县里学习“八大”文件，然后，又派他到基背乡第四农业社工作，希望他这次能够改正自己的错误。
    基背乡第四农业社主任余社来看到黄和昌，十分高兴。原来，在土地改革期间，黄和昌在这里当过干部，是一个积极分子，捉特务、斗恶霸，从不退缩，因此，余社来很尊敬他。可是黄和昌并没有领会这番盛情，他考虑的只是自己的地位、待遇等等，无心好好做工作。到社的第二天，他就要求去乡里的鲤鱼冲小学搭伙食了。
    鲤鱼冲小学有个教师，过去是黄和昌的学生。有一天，两人比待遇的高低。黄和昌过去当过中学教师，又早参加了几年革命工作，可是比待遇的结果，他的工资比那位小学教师仅仅多十多元。他因此无限感慨。
    黄和昌在基背乡第四社“依然故我”，不干工作。社里召开会议，他总要迟到两三个小时，来了，习惯地坐在一边看小说。社干部有时觉得他太不像样了，劝告他说：“黄同志，你整天想的是什么计谋，看的又是什么时闻，为什么这样呢？”余社来也常常提醒他说：“办社不是儿戏的，办得好坏，关系着几百人的生活呀！”可是这些批评都没有激起他对社会主义事业的责任感。他整天躲在小学里，社员很难在社里找到他。今年春节后，虽然县领导上提出干部要艰苦深入，带头生产，然而，黄和昌对社的生产仍不过问。只有在检查生产的时候，社主任亲自到学校邀请，他才不好意思推辞。社主任几次征求他对社的生产计划有什么意见，他总是不着边际地回答：“计划是七成实际的，三成只靠劲头。”除了这两句令人莫名其妙的议论以外，他再也提不出什么意见了。
    人们是非常关心黄和昌的，时刻希望他改正错误。黄和昌无论在泷水乡，在塔岭乡，或是在基背乡，乡的党支部、社的干部都经常给他提意见，帮助他，认为他有一定的群众工作经验和文化水平，可以把工作做好。当年和他一起参加土地改革的乡干部，看到他如今躺着不动，越来越深地陷入个人主义的泥坑，都觉得十分可惜。现在基背乡的干部还是期待黄和昌转变过来，大家还在帮助他。不过，悬崖勒马，更要靠他自己的醒悟和努力。
