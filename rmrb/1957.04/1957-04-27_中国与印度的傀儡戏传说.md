Chinese puppet shows are also called Yanshi plays, due to the following legend in the Liezi Tangwen chapter: King Mu of Zhou traveled west, far beyond the Kunlun Mountains. On his return journey, a western region craftsman named Yanshi came to present his skills. The King asked who he had brought with him. Yanshi replied, "The one I made who can sing!" King Mu watched in amazement, as the figure's steps, bows, and movements were just like a real person. "When the skillful craftsman tilted its chin, it sang in tune; when he raised its hand, it danced in rhythm, changing in a thousand ways, according to his will." The King thought it was truly a real person and, together with his favorite concubine, they watched the performance. As the performance neared its end, the singer blinked its eyes and beckoned to the King's concubines. The King was furious and immediately wanted to execute Yanshi. Yanshi was greatly frightened and immediately dissected the singer to show the King. It was all made of glue, leather, wood, lacquer, white, black, and colorful pigments. The King examined it carefully and saw that inside were the liver, gallbladder, heart, lungs, spleen, kidneys, intestines, and stomach; outside were muscles, bones, limbs, joints, skin, hair, and teeth—all were artificial, but nothing was missing. When put together, it was just like when they first saw it. The King tried disabling its heart, and it could not speak; disabling its liver, and it could not see; disabling its kidneys, and it could not walk. King Mu exclaimed, "Human ingenuity can be the same as the work of creation!" He ordered two carriages to carry it back.

Liezi is said to be a forgery, written by people after the Han Dynasty, but much of its material is based on ancient folk legends. This story of Yanshi's puppet show is similar to ancient Indian legends. In the "Sutra of Births," translated by the Western Jin Dynasty Buddhist monk Zhu Fahu, there is a section called "Buddha Speaks of the Sutra of Five Kings," which says: "At that time, the second craftsman traveled to another country. The king of that country was fond of all kinds of skills. He immediately used wood to make a mechanical wooden figure. Its appearance was upright and correct, no different from a living person. Its clothes and colors were incomparably clever and intelligent. It could sing and dance, and its movements were like a human being. It said: 'My son has lived for so many years and is respected in the country, receiving many gifts.' The king heard this and ordered it to perform. The king and his wife ascended to the pavilion to watch. It performed singing and dancing with various skills. Its kneeling, bowing, advancing, and retreating were better than a living person. The king and his wife were infinitely delighted. It then angled its eyes and looked at the queen. The king saw this from afar and became furious. He quickly ordered his messengers to cut off its head! Why? It angled its eyes to look at my queen? Thinking it had malicious intentions, it looked without hesitation. Its father wept, tears streaming down his face, and knelt down to beg for mercy. 'I have one son, whom I cherish greatly. His sitting, standing, advancing, and retreating relieve my worries. My foolishness prevented me from seeing this fault. If you kill him, I will die with him. I only beg you to have mercy and forgive his crime.' The king was very angry and refused to listen. He said to the king again, 'If you do not spare his life, I wish to kill him with my own hands. Do not let others do it.' The king agreed, so he pulled out a shoulder peg, and the mechanism fell apart, scattered on the ground. The king was astonished, 'Why did I get angry at a piece of wood! This craftsman is unparalleled in the world. He made this mechanism with three hundred and sixty joints, better than a living person.' He immediately rewarded him with millions of taels of gold. He took the gold and went out to share it with his brothers, so they could eat and drink. He sang in a verse: 'Observe this craftsman, who has accomplished much. He made a mechanical wooden figure, surpassing the living. He performs singing, dancing, and entertainment, making the honored one happy. He receives many treasures as rewards, who is the most outstanding?'"

These two interesting stories, in which wooden figures resemble modern robots, were mostly based on fantasy at the time. Although the words recorded are different, the plots are the same and can be said to come from the same source. The ancient culture and art of China and India are closely connected. Ancient folk legends often come from the same source, are transmitted to each other, and the legends of ancient puppet shows are just one example of this.

    中国与印度的傀儡戏传说
    常任侠
    中国的傀儡戏，又叫偃师戏，由于列子汤问篇中有这样一段传说：周穆王西巡，远过昆仑山，在归途有一个西域工人，名叫偃师，前来献艺。王问偕来的是何人？偃师回答说：“臣之所造能倡者！”穆王惊异的观看，步趋俯仰，如同真人一样。“巧夫顉其颐则歌合律，捧其手则舞应节，千变万化，惟意所适”。王以为实在就是真人，与盛姬内御，共同观赏。技将终，倡者瞬其目而招王之左右侍妾。王大怒，立欲诛偃师。偃师大慑，立剖散倡者以示王，皆傅会、革、木、胶、漆、白黑丹青之所为。王仔细的察看，内则肝、胆、心、肺、脾、肾、肠、胃，外则筋、骨、支、节、皮毛、齿发、皆是假物，而无不具备。合会起来，更如初见时一样。王试废其心，则口不能言，废其肝则目不能视。废其肾则足不能步。穆王赞叹说：“人的巧妙，乃可与造化有相同的功能！”诏贰车载之以归。
    列子据说是一部伪书，为汉代以后的人所撰写，但其中的材料，有很多是根据古代的民间传说。这个偃师傀儡戏的故事，即与印度古代的传说相同。西晋三藏竺法护译的“生经”中，有一段“佛说国王五人经”，其中说：“时第二工巧者，转行至他国，应时国王，喜诸技术。即以木材，作机关木人。形貌端正，生人无异。衣服颜色，黠慧无比。能歌工舞，举动如人。辞言：我子生若干年，国中恭敬，多所馈遗。国王闻之，命使作技。王及夫人，升阁而观。作伎歌舞若干方便。跪拜进止，胜于生人。王及夫人，欢喜无量。便角?眼，色视夫人。王遥见之，心怀忿怒，促敕使者，斩其头来！何以?眼视吾夫人？谓有恶意，色视不疑。其父啼泣，泪出五行，长跪请命。吾有一子，甚重爱之，坐起进退，以解忧思。愚意不及，有是失耳。假使杀者，我当共死。唯以加哀，原其罪亹。时王恚甚，不肯听之。复白王言，‘若不活者，愿自手杀。勿使余人。’王便可之，则拔一肩榍，机关解落，碎散在地。王乃惊愕，‘吾身云何瞋于木材！此人工巧，天下无双。作此机关，三百六十节，胜于生人。’即以赏赐亿万两金。即持金出，与诸兄弟，令饮食之。以偈颂曰：‘观此工巧者，多所而成就。机关为木人，过逾于生者。歌舞现伎乐，令尊者欢喜。得赏若干宝，谁为最第一。’”
    这两个有趣的故事，所说木人与现代的机器人相似，在当时多半出于幻想。它所记录的文字虽异，情节相同，可以说是同出于一源。中国与印度的古代文化艺术，息息相通，关于古代的民间传说，也往往同出于一个母体，互相传述，古代傀儡戏的传说，不过是其中之一而已。
