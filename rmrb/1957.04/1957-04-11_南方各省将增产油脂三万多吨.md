Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Ministry of Food, the Ministry of Food Industry, and the China Food Industry Trade Union jointly held an experience exchange meeting for traditional oil presses in Wuhan City from April 2nd to 8th. Representatives from relevant departments in twelve southern provinces, including Jiangsu, Fujian, Guangdong, Hubei, Yunnan, and Sichuan, attended the meeting.

The meeting focused on exchanging experiences in the organization, management, and technical operations of traditional oil presses, and studied and discussed this year's work. The attending representatives drafted a plan for the twelve southern provinces to increase oil production by at least 31,800 tons this year by adopting methods such as increasing oil extraction rates and adding new oil sources.

About 90% of the oil produced in these twelve provinces is produced by traditional oil presses. Most of these oil presses are distributed in the vast rural areas, and most of them are sideline production of agricultural cooperatives. In the past, many regions had not yet organized and managed them, and most oil presses lacked management experience and advanced technical operating experience, so the general oil extraction rate was quite low. In view of these circumstances, the meeting believed that how to organize and manage traditional oil presses and comprehensively promote advanced experience has become a key issue in the current campaign to increase production and practice thrift in the oil industry.

Based on the current uneven distribution of traditional oil presses in various provinces, which has brought many difficulties to purchase and sales integration, raw material arrangement, and transportation and storage, the meeting hoped that each province could conduct a comprehensive plan for traditional oil presses with the province as a unit to make the layout of oil presses more reasonable.

The meeting exchanged more than 20 traditional oil pressing technical experiences, and required all provinces to further carry out an advanced producer movement with the main goal of increasing the oil extraction rate.

    南方各省将增产油脂三万多吨
    据新华社讯　粮食部、食品工业部、中国食品工业工会2日到8日在武汉市联合召开土榨油坊经验交流会议。到会的有江苏、福建、广东、湖北、云南、四川等南方十二个省有关部门的代表九十人。
    会议着重交流了土榨油坊在组织管理和技术操作方面的经验，研究和讨论了今年的工作。到会代表拟定今年南方十二省要采取提高出油率、增加新油源等办法至少增产油脂三万一千八百吨。
    这十二个省出产的油脂，有90％左右是由土榨油坊生产的。这些油坊绝大多数分布在广大农村，而且多数是农业社的副业生产。过去，由于不少地区还没有把它们组织管理起来，多数油坊缺乏管理经验和先进的技术操作经验，一般的出油率都相当低。根据这些情况，会议认为，如何将土榨油坊组织管理起来，全面推广先进经验，已经成为油脂工业当前开展增产节约工作的关键问题。
    会议根据目前各省土榨油坊分布不平衡，因而给购销结合、原料安排、运输储存带来很多困难的情况，希望各省能以省为单位对土榨油坊作一次全面规划，使榨坊布局更加合理。
    会议交流了二十多项土榨的技术经验，要求各省进一步开展以提高出油率为主要目标的先进生产者运动。
