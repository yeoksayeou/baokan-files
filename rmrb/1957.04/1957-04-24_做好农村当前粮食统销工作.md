Do a Good Job in the Current Unified Grain Sales in Rural Areas
By Our Newspaper Commentator

From now until the summer grain harvest, it is the lean season for grain in rural areas. During this period, ordinary grain-deficient households and disaster areas that suffered severe natural disasters last year all need the state to supply grain. Therefore, doing a good job in unified grain sales in rural areas is closely related to the consolidation of agricultural cooperatives and the support of this year's agricultural bumper harvest movement.

Because grain supply in both urban and rural areas was relatively relaxed in the second half of last year, an unreasonable amount of grain was sold, resulting in a deficit in the 1956-1957 grain year and difficulties in balancing the state's grain revenue and expenditure. Therefore, strictly controlling the sales plan and preventing the waste of state grain, while ensuring the normal needs of disaster victims and truly grain-deficient people, has become a prominent problem in the current grain work.

It should be recognized that the 1956-1957 fiscal year is after agricultural cooperativization, with agricultural cooperatives as the unit to continue to implement the "three fix" policy for grain. Therefore, there are many favorable conditions for doing a good job in the current unified grain sales in rural areas.

Before agricultural cooperativization, the state's grain purchase and sales work was carried out on the basis of small-scale peasant economy, with individual households as the unit. Since it was difficult for the state to fully verify the grain output of individual farmers, it was not easy to completely delineate the boundary between surplus and deficiency, and it was also difficult to distinguish between revolving grain and unified purchase grain. Therefore, every year during the grain-deficient season, the state supplied a portion of grain that should not have been supplied or supplied more than it should have because the situation was unclear. After agricultural cooperativization, grain purchase and sales work is carried out on the basis of cooperative economy, with agricultural cooperatives as the unit. Not only has the number of purchase and sales units been greatly reduced, but also the grain final accounts and distribution of agricultural cooperatives are roughly close to the actual output. In this way, it is easy to delineate the boundary between surplus and deficiency by determining the purchase and sales figures on the basis of the "three fix" grain consumption standards with agricultural cooperatives as the unit, and it is also easy to distinguish between unified purchase grain and revolving grain. Therefore, it is generally possible to calculate and verify who is deficient and who is not, and how much is deficient. The phenomena of unified purchase of "excess grain" and false supply can be basically overcome. Although there are still some individual farmers and rural non-agricultural population in rural areas, they account for only a small number in rural areas, and their grain surplus and deficiency figures are also easier to ascertain than in the past.

After balancing the grain surplus and deficiency with agricultural cooperatives as the unit, the scope of state supply has been narrowed, and the amount of supply has also been reduced. In surplus-grain cooperatives and self-sufficient cooperatives, some members were grain-deficient households in the past, and some members were rural non-agricultural population in the past. After their grain deficiency is adjusted by the agricultural cooperative, the state reduces the amount that should be purchased, which is used as a supply amount within the cooperative, basically achieving no grain-deficient households. In grain-deficient cooperatives, some members were surplus-grain households in the past. The state uses the grain that they should have unified purchased to offset a portion of the grain deficiency in grain-deficient cooperatives. The state also stipulates that the public grain payable by grain-deficient cooperatives should be changed to a substitute payment, which also reduces the grain deficiency of grain-deficient cooperatives.

Although there were disasters across the country last year, grain production still increased compared to 1955, and the amount of state requisition and purchase decreased compared to the previous year, and the amount of grain supplied to rural areas increased compared to the previous year. Therefore, the amount of grain occupied by rural areas this year has also increased compared to previous years. According to the calculation based on the national grain production increase plus the grain that the state purchased less and sold more to rural areas this year, the average farmer in the country will retain about sixty catties more of raw grain per person than in the previous year. According to surveys in various places, many agricultural cooperatives retained more seed grain in addition to the grain distributed to members during the autumn harvest distribution last year, and also retained a portion of mobile grain.

In addition to the above favorable conditions, in places where new wheat and early rice are harvested in May and June this year, farmers can receive grain to tide them over until the autumn harvest. In addition to taking care of farmers' needs for variety adjustment, the state can basically not supply grain to these places. This is also an important condition for controlling the rural sales plan.

The above shows that although the state needs to supply more grain to rural areas during the lean season, there are conditions to sell grain according to the state sales plan, and it is not necessary to consciously relax the supply as in previous years.

Of course, we should also see that there are still some unstable factors in the current unified grain sales in rural areas. In the second half of last year, the grain distribution within some agricultural cooperatives was not entirely reasonable. Many members consumed grain generously in the previous period, wasting a portion of grain, which affected the food ration in the later period. Some agricultural cooperatives distributed grain according to the principle of more work, more gain, so that the surplus and deficiency of grain distributed among members varied greatly. These problems must be properly resolved. The main way to solve the problem is to earnestly do a good job in mobilizing cooperative cadres and members. The grain surplus and deficiency among members can be adjusted to a certain extent. At the same time, the mobile grain controlled by the agricultural cooperative should also be taken out to supply grain-deficient members. In this way, grain-deficient members in surplus-grain cooperatives and self-sufficient cooperatives can basically rely on internal adjustment to solve the problem, and grain-deficient cooperatives can also solve a portion of the problem through internal adjustment. This is of great benefit to ensuring the basic food ration of grain-deficient members, stabilizing farmers' production emotions, and reducing unnecessary state supply, and it is also entirely possible to achieve.

In addition, cooperative cadres and members should also be educated to strictly abide by the state's grain supply plan, save grain, and persuade agricultural cooperatives and members not to use food rations, feed, and seeds to engage in sideline production, or take them to the market to sell at high prices for profit, so as not to expand the state's supply to rural areas and increase the state's difficulties.

Recently, due to negligence in work, mass "grain riots" have occurred in individual areas. According to investigations, the vast majority of the people rioting over grain have ideological problems, and only a very small number are truly deficient in grain. In the future grain-deficient season, this situation may still occur. All localities should combine rectification of cooperatives and spring plowing production, and conduct a planned inspection of unified grain sales in agricultural cooperatives according to the rural fixed-sales plan, especially in those places where fixed sales are unstable or where people are starting to shout about grain deficiency, they should take the initiative to inspect and solve problems in a timely manner.

    做好农村当前粮食统销工作
    本报评论员
    从现在起到夏粮登场以前，农村正是粮食青黄不接的季节。在这一段时间内，农村一般缺粮户和去年遭受了严重自然灾害的灾区，都需要国家供应粮食。因此，做好农村粮食统销工作，对于农业社的巩固和支持今年农业大丰产运动，都有很密切的关系。
    由于去年下半年不少地区城乡粮食供应偏松，不合理地多销了一部分粮食，以致1956—1957粮食年度粮食收支发生逆差，国家粮食收支平衡发生困难。因此，严格掌握销售计划，防止浪费国家粮食，同时切实保证灾民和真正缺粮人民的正常需要，就成了当前粮食工作中突出的问题。
    应当看到，1956—1957年度是在农业合作化以后，以农业社为单位，继续执行粮食“三定”政策，因此，做好当前农村粮食统销工作是有许多有利条件的。
    在农业合作化以前，国家粮食购销工作，是在小农经济基础上以户为单位进行的。由于国家对个体农户的粮食产量很难完全核实，粮食余缺界限也不容易全部划清，周转粮和统购粮也难分清，因而国家每年在缺粮季节里，总有一部分粮食因为摸底不清，不应该供应而供应了，或者是应该少供应而多供应了。农业合作化以后，粮食购销工作是在合作经济基础上以农业社为单位进行的，不但购销单位大大地减少了，而且农业社的粮食决算分配的产量同实际产量大体接近了。这样，按“三定”用粮标准以农业社为单位来核定购销数字，余缺界限也就容易划清，统购粮和周转粮也容易分清。因此谁缺谁不缺，缺多缺少，一般都有账可算，有据可查。统购“过头粮”和虚假供应的现象基本上可以克服了。虽然农村中还有一部分个体农户和农村非农业人口，但他们在农村中只占少数，他们的粮食余缺数字也比过去容易查清。
    以农业社为单位平衡粮食余缺以后，需要国家供应的面缩小了，需要供应的数量也减少了。在余粮社和自足社内，有一部分社员过去是缺粮户，也有一些社员过去是农村非农业人口，他们的缺粮数量由农业社进行余缺调剂以后，国家减少了应购的数量，就在社内抵作供应量，基本上可以做到没有缺粮户。在缺粮社内，也有一部分社员过去是余粮户，国家把他们应该统购的粮食，抵作缺粮社一部分缺粮数量，国家对缺粮社应缴的公粮又规定改征代金，也减少了缺粮社的缺粮数量。
    去年虽然全国有灾，但粮食产量仍比1955年增加，而且国家征购数量比上年度减少，供应农村的粮食又比上年度增加。因此，今年农村占有的粮食也比往年增加了。根据全国粮食增产数量加上今年国家对农村少收多销的粮食来计算，今年全国农民平均每人要比上一个年度多留原粮六十斤左右。据各地调查，许多农业社在去年秋收分配时除了分配给社员的粮食，农业社都多留了种子粮，还留了一部分机动粮。
    除了上述有利条件，在今年五、六月新麦和早稻登场的地方，农民可以分到接秋的粮食。国家除了照顾农民品种调剂需要以外，对这些地方可以基本上不供应粮食。这也是掌握农村销售计划的一个重要条件。
    以上说明，虽然在农村粮食青黄不接的季节，国家需要对农村多供应一些粮食，但是有条件可以按国家销售计划销售粮食，不必再像往年那样有意识地放宽供应了。
    诚然，我们还应当看到，当前农村粮食统销工作中还存在着一些不稳定的因素。在去年下半年，有些地方农业社内粮食分配不尽合理，许多社员在以前一段时间里，对粮食消费宽打宽用，已经浪费了一部分粮食，影响了后期的口粮。有些农业社按多劳多得的原则分配粮食，以致社员之间所分得的粮食余缺悬殊。对这些问题必须妥善加以解决。解决的主要办法，是要切实做好社干和社员的动员工作。社员之间的粮食余缺是可以调剂一部分的。同时，农业社掌握的机动粮食也应当拿出来供给缺粮社员。这样，余粮社和自足社内的缺粮社员基本上可以做到依靠社内调剂解决，缺粮社也可以经过社内调剂解决一部分。这对保证缺粮社员基本口粮和安定农民生产情绪，减少国家不必要的供应，都有很大的好处，也是完全有可能做到的。
    此外，还应当教育社干部和社员严格遵守国家粮食供应计划，节约用粮，说服农业社和社员不要用口粮、饲料、种子去搞副业生产，或者拿到市场上去高价出售，谋取厚利，以免扩大国家对农村的供应，增加国家的困难。
    最近个别地区由于工作上的疏忽，已经发生过群众“闹粮”事件。根据调查，闹粮群众绝大部分有思想问题，真正缺粮的占极少数。在今后缺粮季节里，这种情况还可能发生，各地应当结合整社和春耕生产，根据农村定销计划，有计划地对农业社进行一次粮食统销的检查，特别是那些定销不稳定，或者开始有人叫喊缺粮的地方，更应当主动地及时地去检查，解决问题。
