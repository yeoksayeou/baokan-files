	I Advocate Fundamentally Abolishing the Cadre Award System
	Should leading personnel in enterprises receive awards when they complete and exceed production targets? Comrade Tiangong believes that "the problem is not whether full-time personnel of the party and mass organizations in enterprises should receive bonuses, but whether some enterprises have promptly revised backward labor quotas." I believe that backward quotas certainly have some impact on the amount of bonuses paid, but we should mainly analyze whether this reward system is good or bad based on its effect on production.
	From what I understand, this reward system has not played a positive role in enterprise production and worker unity. On the contrary, it has hindered cadres and affected unity between cadres, and between cadres and workers. The bonus distribution situation at the Shenyang Foundry in the second quarter of 1956 was like this: the factory director's highest bonus reached 120.08 yuan, and the lowest was 92.16 yuan; the section chief's highest bonus was 64.92 yuan, and the lowest was 24.50 yuan; the staff and clerks' highest was 29.06 yuan, and the lowest was only 9.13 yuan; various worker rewards reached a maximum of 19.80 yuan, and a minimum of only 5.20 yuan.
	The fact that leading cadres receive more bonuses than general cadres and workers has caused many problems. Workers reflect: "Workers do the work, and get the small change, leaders get the big money." Some leading cadres dare not accept excessive bonuses. Some enterprises, in order to get awards, are unwilling to develop advanced production plans, and simply pursue quantity, ignoring quality. Some enterprises even falsely report achievements in order to obtain bonuses.
	From the perspective of this reward system itself, it is also unreasonable. First of all, completing production tasks is originally the basic duty of all staff. If it is stipulated that awards should be given as long as the task is completed, then it is tantamount to admitting that not completing the task is also legitimate. Is it the case that cadres in our socialist enterprises only complete production tasks in order to obtain bonuses?
	Secondly, I believe that if cadres of enterprise party organizations, trade unions, and Communist Youth League organizations receive the same awards as administrative cadres, it will weaken their supervisory role over production. In the first quarter of 1956, the chief engineer of Harbin No. 1 Tool Factory signed off on 20,000 substandard products as "qualified products." As a result, the value of goods produced in the first quarter was greatly inflated, and the conditions for obtaining awards were "created". After the municipal industrial trade union learned about this situation, it instructed the factory's trade union to conduct an inspection, but because the grassroots trade union cadres of this factory also received technical personnel bonuses, no inspection report was ever submitted.
	Thirdly, the implementation of this reward system in enterprises often leads to an ever-increasing range of beneficiaries. Originally, this reward system was initially implemented in several major departments such as production, planning, and labor wages; later, personnel from the security, personnel, and general affairs departments believed that they also had a role in completing the task, so they also received rewards. After these departments received awards, the cooks then proposed: "If we don't cook for you, you can't complete the task no matter how hard you try," and the security and fire prevention personnel proposed: "If we don't protect the factory's safety, you will have problems completing the task." In this way, as long as the enterprise completes its production tasks, from the factory director down to the odd-job workers, everyone gets a bonus. This kind of egalitarian approach of awarding everyone regardless of diligence or laziness cannot play any role in encouraging the advanced.
	In addition, this reward system is generally only implemented for cadres in industrial enterprises, while it is not implemented in state organs, cultural and educational institutions, health units, etc. Following the above reasoning, does this mean that these units have no tasks to complete? Are they fundamentally unrelated to production and construction? If they also have tasks to complete, and their tasks are inseparable from various production and construction activities, then they also have reason to ask the state for bonuses.
	In short, I believe that the current reward system for technical personnel in enterprises for completing and exceeding production targets is more harmful than beneficial, whether from the perspective of the system itself or the production effect. In order to facilitate the development of the increase production and practice economy movement and enhance the unity among employees, and to strengthen the relationship between enterprise leaders and general employees, I suggest abolishing this reward system.

### 我主张根本取消干部得奖制度

    我主张根本取消干部得奖制度
    企业领导人员在完成和超额完成生产任务的时候应该不应该得奖？天工同志认为“问题不在于企业的党和群众组织的专职人员应不应拿奖金，而是有些企业对于落后的劳动定额有没有及时修改。”我认为落后的定额固然对奖金的支出多少有一定的影响，但我们主要应该从这种奖励制度对生产所起作用来分析它好坏。
    据我了解，这种奖励制度对于企业生产和职工团结并没有起好的作用，相反拉了干部的后腿，影响干部与干部之间、干部与工人之间的团结。沈阳铸造厂1956年第二季度发奖情况就是这样，厂长最高奖金达一百二十元零八分，最低九十二元一角六分；科长最高奖金六十四元九角二分，最低二十四元五角；科员和办事员最高二十九元零六分，最低九元一角三分；工人各种奖励最高十九元八角，最低仅五元二角。
    领导干部得奖超过一般干部和工人，引起了许多问题。工人们反映：“工人干活在前头，奖金拿零头，领导拿大头”。有些领导干部因奖金过多，不敢要。还有些企业为了得奖，不愿制订先进的生产计划，单纯追求数量，忽视质量。有的企业甚至为了获得奖金虚报成绩。
    从这种奖励制度本身来看也是不合理的。首先，完成生产任务本来就是一切工作人员的起码职责，如果规定只要完成任务就给奖，那就等于承认完不成任务也是合法的了。难道我们社会主义企业的干部仅仅就是为了获得奖金才完成生产任务吗？
    其次，我认为企业党组织、工会、青年团组织的干部如果也和行政干部同样得奖，就会减弱他们对生产的监督作用。哈尔滨第一工具厂1956年第一季度曾由总工程师签字把两万件次品当成“合格品”。于是，第一季度商品产值便完成很多，“创造”了得奖条件。市产业工会了解这情况后，责成该厂工会进行检查，但因这个厂基层工会干部同样领取了技职人员奖金，所以一直没有提出检查报告。
    再次，这种奖励制度在企业中执行起来，往往使得奖面越来越大。本来这种奖励制度最初是在生产、计划、劳动工资等几个主要科室中执行；后来保卫、人事、总务科人员认为完成任务同样有他们一份作用，于是他们也得到奖励。这些科室得奖以后，炊事员又提出：“我们不煮饭给你们吃，你们再努力也完不成任务”，警卫消防人员提出：“我们不保卫工厂的安全，你们要完成任务也是有问题”。这样一来，只要企业完成生产任务，上自厂长，下至勤杂人员都有了奖。这种不分勤奋怠惰一律得奖的平均主义作法，根本不能起什么鼓励先进的作用。
    此外，这种奖励制度一般仅在工业企业干部中实行，而国家机关、文教、卫生等单位都没有实行。照上边的道理推论，是否就是说这些单位没有任务需要完成呢？是否与生产建设根本无关呢？如果他们也有任务需要完成，他们的任务与各种生产建设分不开的话，那么他们也有理由向国家要奖金了。
    总之，我认为企业技职人员现行的完成和超额完成生产任务的奖励制度，不论从制度本身或生产效果上看，都是害多利少。为了有利于开展增产节约运动和增进职工之间的团结，密切企业领导干部和一般职工之间的关系，我建议取消这种奖励制度。
