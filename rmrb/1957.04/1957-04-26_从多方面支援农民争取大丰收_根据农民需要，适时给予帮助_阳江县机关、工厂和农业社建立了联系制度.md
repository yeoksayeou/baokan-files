　　This Newspaper Report: Guangdong Province, Yangjiang County, government offices, group of workers, students, industry and commerce people, and city residents have launched an upsurge to support farmers striving for a bumper harvest.

　　The employees of the Baisha Supply and Marketing Cooperative have all decided to actively educate their family members in the countryside and help them clear any overdrafts they still owe to the agricultural cooperatives. Workers in industrial and transportation units in the county town have also decided to mobilize family members who have flowed into the city and are living idle to return to their hometowns to participate in production. After the financial and economic cadres in Shangyang Town recognized the importance of cadres promoting a style of hard work and plain living and sharing weal and woe with all the people to build the motherland, they all made plans to save money and invest their surplus funds in rural credit cooperatives every month, so that they could be re-lent to agricultural cooperatives experiencing difficulties with production funds.

　　Government offices, organizations, and factories in Yangjiang County have also adopted a method of "linking up" with agricultural cooperatives, establishing some long-term contact systems. Their regulations stipulate: (1) Each government office and organization must be linked to an agricultural cooperative. People should be sent to visit once or several times a month to provide timely assistance based on the needs of the farmers; (2) During busy farming seasons and when there is a shortage of labor, people should be sent to provide support; (3) Fertilizers accumulated by government offices and organizations should be provided to the agricultural cooperatives they are linked to without compensation; (4) When agricultural cooperatives have financial difficulties, the surplus funds invested in credit cooperatives by cadres from government offices and organizations should be lent to the agricultural cooperatives first. So far, more than ninety units in Yangjiang County have established this kind of connection with more than sixty agricultural cooperatives.

　　Town residents and industrial and commercial people have also successively lowered the prices of manure they sell, and even given it to farmers without compensation.

    从多方面支援农民争取大丰收
    根据农民需要，适时给予帮助
    阳江县机关、工厂和农业社建立了联系制度
    本报讯　广东阳江县机关、团体工作人员、工人、学生、工商业者和城镇居民掀起了支援农民争取大丰收的热潮。
    白沙供销社的职工们，都决定对在乡家属积极进行教育，并帮助家属清还在农业社的超支款项。县城工业交通等单位的职工，还决定动员流入城市来闲居的家属回乡参加生产。上洋镇的财经机关干部在认识了干部应发扬艰苦朴素作风，与全体人民同甘共苦建设祖国的重要意义后，都纷纷计划省吃俭用，逐月把节余的钱投入乡村信用社，以便转借给生产资金发生困难的农业社。
    阳江县城的机关团体和工厂，还采取了跟农业社“挂钩”的方式，建立了一些长期联系的制度。他们规定：（1）机关、团体必须联系一个农业社。每月派人去访问一次或数次，根据农民需要给予适时的帮助；（2）在农忙、劳力不足的时候，派人前往支援；（3）机关、团体积集的肥料，无代价的供给所联系的农业社；（4）农业社资金困难的时候，机关、团体干部投入信用社的余款，要首先转借给农业社。到现在为止，阳江县已有九十多个单位同六十多个农业社建立了这种联系。
    城镇居民和工商业者，也纷纷降低原来出售粪肥的价格，甚至无代价的送给农民。
