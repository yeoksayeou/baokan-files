Xinhua News Agency, April 15th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Lei Peng reports: Hou Wailu, a famous thinker and historian in our country, proposed his opinion on the periodization of ancient Chinese history in his lecture "The Evolution of Academic Thought During the Transition from the Late Zhou to the Qin and Han Dynasties" at Peking University today. He believes that feudal society began during the Qin and Han dynasties and fully formed during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han.

Hou Wailu's lecture was the third academic lecture in the "Historical Issues Lecture Series" held by Peking University.

In his lecture, Hou Wailu expressed his views on the periodization of ancient Chinese history from the perspective of social trends of thought in the late Zhou and Qin and Han dynasties.

There are several well-known experts in the study of Chinese intellectual history, such as Hou Wailu, Guo Moruo, Lü Zhenyu, Du Shousu, and Feng Youlan. Due to their different understandings of ancient Chinese social trends of thought, they hold different views on the periodization of ancient Chinese history.

In today's academic lecture, he questioned scholars who advocate that the feudal system originated in the Western Zhou and Spring and Autumn periods: During the Warring States period, there were numerous schools of thought and a hundred schools of thought contended. Could there be such a flourishing era in academic terms in feudal societies of other countries? He believes that from Qin Shihuang's "burning books and burying scholars" to Emperor Wu of Han's "dismissing the hundred schools and respecting Confucianism alone," this unification of thought, which facilitated feudal rule, marked the formation of feudalism.

    侯外庐在北京大学讲学
    认为中国封建社会起于秦汉
    据新华社15日讯　新华社记者雷朋报道：我国著名思想史家侯外庐今天在北京大学主讲“周末与秦汉之际学术思想的演变”中，提出了他对中国古代史分期问题的意见，他认为封建社会开始于秦汉之际，到汉武帝时完全形成。
    侯外庐的这个讲演，是北京大学举行“历史问题讲座”以来的第三次学术讲演。
    侯外庐在讲题中，从周末和秦汉时代的社会思潮方面，发表了他对中国古代史分期问题的意见。
    研究我国思想史的有侯外庐、郭沫若、吕振羽、杜守素、冯友兰等比较著名的专家。由于他们对中国古代社会思潮的不同理解，他们对中国古代史分期问题的看法不同。
    他在今天的学术讲演中，向主张封建制产生在西周和春秋战国之际的学者们提出了质问：战国时代学派林立，百家争鸣，在世界各国的封建社会中，难道能有这样在学术上繁荣的时代吗？他认为自秦始皇“焚书坑儒”，一直到汉武帝“罢黜百家，独尊儒术”，这种把思想定于一尊而便于封建统治才标志着封建的形成。
