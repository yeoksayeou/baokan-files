    Shandong Zhaoyuan County Organizes Accounting Guidance Groups
    To Help Agricultural Cooperatives Develop Financial Revenue and Expenditure Plans
    (Our dispatch) To help agricultural cooperatives strengthen their financial management to meet the needs of agricultural production development, Zhaoyuan County, Shandong Province, organized a hundred cadres consisting of accountants from county and district units, directors of bank business offices, and agricultural loan officers to study accounting knowledge for agricultural cooperatives and form accounting guidance groups. They helped 206 agricultural cooperatives prepare this year's financial revenue and expenditure plans and also helped 151 agricultural cooperatives develop loan plans, which proved to be very effective.
    The guidance groups, cooperating with township cadres, conducted education on running cooperatives diligently and thriftily and democratically through the preparation of financial plans, tapping the potential of agricultural cooperatives in many ways. For example, the Luge Village Agricultural Cooperative in Ruili Township, Luoshan District, adhering to the spirit of ensuring stable income and tight expenditure, reduced agricultural production costs from 30% of total income to 22%. As a result, this year's income per labor day will increase by 4 jiao 1 fen 1 li compared to last year, with an average increase of 15 yuan in income per worker compared to last year.
    When helping agricultural cooperatives prepare financial plans, the guidance groups also paid attention to mobilizing members to invest, especially the families of officers, government cadres, and workers, urging them to repay the money owed to the cooperatives as much as possible based on their circumstances. After mobilization, the 14 agricultural cooperatives in Ruili Township, Luoshan District, can recover 5,713 yuan of members' debts in the first half of the year; the Xuejia cooperative can receive 1,000 yuan in cash in the first half of the year.
    By closing old accounts and establishing new accounts, the guidance groups helped agricultural cooperatives to clear up stockpiled agricultural and sideline products. According to the statistics of 206 agricultural cooperatives alone, the cleared stockpiles of wheat, soybeans, corn, peanuts, miscellaneous grains, willow branches, leather, etc., can be converted into 10,843 yuan in cash. Among them, the 13 cooperatives in Ruili Township, Luoshan District, stockpiled 79,000 jin of grain, which can be converted into 6,568 yuan in cash. Before making a plan, the Xiaozhuliu Agricultural Cooperative in Lingshan District had requested a loan of 2,100 yuan from the state. After clearing the warehouse, not only did they not need a loan, but they also had surplus money.
    Agricultural cooperatives that have developed financial plans with the help of the guidance groups have not only made full use of their own capital and saved state loans, but have also boosted the production enthusiasm of their members.

    山东招远县组织会计辅导团
    帮助农业社订财务收支计划
    本报讯　为了帮助农业社加强财务管理工作，以适应农业生产发展的需要，山东招远县组织了县、区各单位的会计、银行营业所主任和农贷员共一百名干部，学习农业社的会计知识，组成会计辅导团。帮助二百零六个农业社编出了今年的财务收支计划，还帮助一百五十一个农业社提出贷款计划，收效很好。
    辅导团和乡干部互相配合，通过编制财务计划，对农业社进行勤俭办社和民主办社的教育，从多方面挖掘了农业社的潜力。如罗山区芮里乡鲁格村农业社，本着收入打的稳，支出打的紧的精神，使农业生产成本由占总收入的30％降低到22％，因此，今年每个劳动日的收入较去年将增加四角一分一厘，平均每个劳力较去年增加收入十五元。
    辅导团在帮助农业社编制财务计划时，还注意到发动社员投资，特别是对军官、机关干部、工人的家属，动员他们根据可能条件，尽量归还欠社里的钱，罗山区芮里乡十四个农业社，经过动员后，上半年能收回社员欠款五千七百十三元；薛家社上半年可收入现金一千元。
    辅导团通过结束旧账，建立新账，帮助农业社清查了积压的农副业产品，仅据二百零六个农业社的统计，清理出积压的小麦、大豆、玉米、花生米、小杂粮和柳条、皮革等，即可折现金一万零八百四十三元；其中罗山区芮里乡的十三个社，就积压粮食七万九千斤，折现金六千五百六十八元。灵山区小诸流农业社在未做计划前，曾向国家要求贷款二千一百元，清仓后，不但不要求贷款，还有了余钱。
    经过辅导团帮助制定财务计划的农业社，不仅充分运用了自有资财，节约了国家贷款，而且鼓舞了社员的生产热情。
