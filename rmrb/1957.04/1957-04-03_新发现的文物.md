Newly Discovered Cultural Relics

    Tianbao Relics from the Tang Dynasty Daming Palace Site
    The northeast of Bafuzhuang in the northeastern suburbs of Xi'an City is the site of the inner garden of the Daming Palace in the Tang Dynasty. On December 30, 1956, the brick and tile factory there discovered one large and one small silver plate at a depth of one meter while taking soil for brick burning. The large plate has a diameter of one chi two fen (approximately 34 cm). The center features a raised lion, surrounded by carvings of peony flowers, which are extremely vivid and lively. There are also four silver ingots, each engraved with the year of manufacture, official titles, and names. Among them, two ingots measure nine chi (approximately 30 cm) and one chi one fen (approximately 34 cm) in length, respectively. The front is engraved with "Presented by Minister Yang Guozhong, concurrently Censor-in-Chief of the Ministry of War, specially in charge of minting coins in various regions." The back is engraved with "Taxed mountain silver one ingot fifty taels precisely, January of the tenth year of Tianbao" and "He City silver one ingot fifty taels precisely, Xuancheng Commandery." In total, the silver ingots are inscribed with the names of five commanderies: Xin'an Commandery, Xuancheng Commandery, Nanhai Commandery, Langning Commandery, and Huaize Commandery, and the names of nine people: Yang Guozhong, Zhi Ting, Yuchi Yan, Miao Fengqian, Peng Quan, He Rupu, Chen Ruyu, Chen Guangyuan, and [illegible] Xian. Except for Yang Guozhong, the Tang History does not record the other people. According to the inscriptions on the silver ingots, these were likely tribute items buried underground due to the An Lushan Rebellion. The brick and tile factory has now handed over these cultural relics to the Xi'an Municipal Cultural Relics Management Committee. (Hua Yun)

    Tax Collection Notice of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom
    The Shanghai Municipal Cultural Relics Sorting Warehouse recently rescued a tax collection notice from Taicang County, Jiangsu Province, dating back to the eleventh year of Xinyou (corresponding to the eleventh year of Xianfeng in the Qing Dynasty, 1861 AD), from waste paper at Wenzheng Paper Store on Zhejiang Road in the city.
    The original document is brush-printed on maotai paper, filled in with ink, and stamped with a long rectangular vermilion seal bearing the inscription "Zuǒ èr jūn shuài tú jì" (Left Second Army Commander's seal). The top is printed with the four characters "Yì zhī yóu dān" (易知由單), which refers to a type of notification used by the government to urge taxpayers to pay taxes.
    The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom recaptured Taicang Prefecture in the tenth year of Gengshen (corresponding to the tenth year of Xianfeng in the Qing Dynasty, 1860 AD). This "Yì zhī yóu dān" was issued in the second year after the recapture of Taicang Prefecture. According to the "Taicang Prefecture Chronicle," the measures taken by the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom after recapturing Taicang Prefecture in the tenth year of Gengshen included: "Measuring acres to create registers, and assigning tenants to collect grain." Regarding "assigning tenants to collect grain," Gu Ruzheng recorded at the time: "The brigade commander and squad leader were assigned to create flower registers based on the fields, using the actual planting as the standard. Landowners were not allowed to register to collect rent."
    The discovery of this "Yì zhī yóu dān" is of great significance for studying the land system of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. (Sun Guisi)

    Three Ming Dynasty Ancient Cannons
    The Guangzhou Municipal Cultural Relics Management Committee recently discovered an ancient cannon among scrap iron recovered from the "Huaning Foundry." The cannon is ninety-two centimeters long, has an outer muzzle diameter of seventeen centimeters, an inner diameter of six centimeters, and weighs one hundred and ninety-four jin (approximately 97 kg). The cannon body is engraved with the characters "Chongzhen Gengchen, manufactured by Wang Guozhao, a participant in the South Shao State Council." This cannon was cast in Guangdong in 1640 AD, five years earlier than the iron cannon cast in the first year of Hongguang during the Southern Ming Dynasty, which was discovered some time ago at the foot of Yuexiu Mountain. The Hongguang iron cannon has been transported to Beijing for the "Chinese People's Liberation Army Artillery Exhibition."
    It is known that there are two other iron cannons cast during the Yongli period of the Southern Ming Dynasty. One was recently discovered in the sea mud next to Kai Tak Airport in Hong Kong, and the other is located in the Xishan Guandi Temple in Daliang Town, Shunde County, Guangdong Province. Both were cast in the fourth year of Yongli (1650 AD).

    新发现的文物
    唐大明宫遗址的天宝遗物
    西安市东北郊八府庄东北，是唐代大明宫的内苑遗址；1956年12月30日该处砖瓦厂因烧砖取土，在一公尺的深度下发现大小银盘各一个。大盘直径一市尺零二分，中心突起狮子一只，四周刻牡丹花，极生动活泼。银铤四个，铤上均刻有制造年月和官职姓名等。其中有两铤，一长九市寸，一长一市尺零一分。正面均刻“专知诸道铸钱使兵部侍郎兼御史中丞臣杨国忠进”；背面一刻“天宝十载正月日税山银一铤五十两正”，一刻“宣城郡和市银壹铤五十两”。总计银铤所刻的地名为信安郡、宣城郡、南海郡、郎宁郡和怀泽郡五郡，人名为杨国忠、智庭、尉迟严、苗奉倩、彭泉、何如璞、陈如玉、陈光远和□□仙九人。除杨国忠外，其余诸人唐书均无记载。据银铤上所刻的文字，当为当时进贡之物，可能是因安史之乱，埋藏地下。现砖瓦厂已将这些文物送交西安市文物管理委员会。　（华云）
    太平天国的催税通知单
    上海市文物整理仓库最近在该市浙江路文正纸边号的废纸中抢救出一件太平天国辛酉十一年（即清咸丰十一年、公元1861年）江苏省太仓县的催纳田税通知单。
    原件是毛太纸墨刷，墨笔填写，盖有“左贰军帅图记”长方朱印。上端印有“易知由单”（即政府用来催纳税人纳税的一种通知书）四个字。
    按太平天国克复太仓州是在庚申十年（即清咸丰十年、公元1860年），这件“易知由单”正是克复太仓州的第二年发的。根据“太仓州志”里面的记载，太平天国在庚申十年克复太仓州后的措施有：“计亩造册，着佃收粮”；关于“着佃收粮”，当时顾汝钲的记载中说：“着旅帅卒长按田造花册，以实种作准，业户不得挂号收租。”
    这件“易知由单”的发现，对研究太平天国田亩制度有很重要的意义。　　（孙桂思）
    三尊明代古炮
    广州市文物管理委员会最近从“华宁铸造厂”回收的废铁中，发现了一门古炮。这门古炮身长九十二公分，炮口外径长十七公分，内径长六公分，重量一百九十四市斤。炮身镌有“崇祯庚辰、署南韶国国参议王国造”等字样。这门炮是公元1640年在广东铸造的，比前些时在越秀山脚所发现的南明弘光元年所铸造的铁炮还早五年。弘光铁炮已运送北京“中国人民解放军炮兵展览会”。
    据所知还有两门南明永历年间所铸的铁炮，一门最近在香港启德机场旁边的海泥中发现，一门存在广东省顺德县大良镇的西山关帝庙内，都是永历四年（公元1650年）所铸造的。
