    Dad's "Barrier"
    Zhe Zhong

    I went to the city on Sunday to visit my former superior.
    "Unfortunately, Section Chief and the others have gone to see a play." The nanny's voice was very low, and she kept glancing into the inner room as she spoke.
    "Haha, you're lying to me..." I laughed and started to walk inside.
    She quickly stopped me, explaining, "Xiao Lan is studying hard."
    "But it's Sunday!"
    Xiao Lan came running out, swinging her little braids.
    "Hello, university student comrade! What wind blew you here? You've gotten arrogant now that you've been accepted to university!" Before I could reply, she grabbed my hand and pulled me towards the inner room.
    The nanny stood at the door, looking troubled.
    "I was about to suffocate!" she said, handing me a glass of water. "But what can I do?"
    I didn't understand any of this. She laughed, realizing that what she'd said made no sense, and sat down to take a diary out of her bag, handing it to me, saying:
    "Read it, you'll understand."
    It was a bit dark in the room, so she turned on the desk lamp. With a sense of unease, I began to read:
    "Last night, Little Braids wanted to sleep with me. We couldn't fall asleep for a long time. She said that she's been suffering from insomnia since the start of this semester, and that this year it's very difficult to get into school. Later, she cried, afraid that she would lose face if she didn't get into high school – lose her own face, lose her parents' face. I tried to comfort her, but ended up crying myself. She asked me why I was crying, and I said I didn't know. She said, 'Don't lie to me, you're afraid of failing the exam and not getting past your dad's barrier.' Isn't that right? Dad always says that his family was poor when he was little and he didn't get much schooling, so now he definitely wants the two of us sisters to go to university."
    Another day's entry read: "Dad called me over as soon as I put down my schoolbag. Recently, I don't know why, but my heart starts racing whenever I see Dad. Dad asked me in detail about my studies, telling me to work harder, otherwise it would be 'dangerous'....
    "Dad's words are like a stone weighing on my heart. How much I need him to tell me what to do if I fail the exam, but he doesn't even want to think about that possibility...."
    I turned another page, and it said: "Today, the principal gave a report to us junior and senior high school students, telling us not to be too nervous, and that it's not necessarily shameful if we don't get into higher education, and that some people are bound to fail. After listening to the principal's report, I wish I could instantly become a reclamation team member, a worker, or a member of an agricultural cooperative, dedicating all my strength to working with everyone to build our motherland, so that everyone wouldn't have to worry about not having a school to go to, how wonderful that would be!
    "After dinner, that darn Little Braids came to sleep with me again. We were whispering and talking about the principal's report in the room. I didn't expect Dad to hear us, and he told Mom to call me over. Dad was sitting on the edge of the bed, so angry that the ash from his cigarette kept falling down. I was so scared, biting on the end of my braid, afraid to look up. Mom spoke first: 'The child's idea isn't bad, why are you getting so angry!' Dad jumped up in a rage: 'Is that how you care for your children? Yes, it would be so glorious for you, the mother, when Xiao Lan becomes a worker.... It's a pity that you (facing me) were born into the wrong family. I'm telling you, you absolutely must get into high school this year, otherwise don't even think about seeing me! Do you understand? You're my daughter!' Mom patiently said: 'You can't think like that, everyone can't think like you....' Dad interrupted her, saying: 'Think like me how? What did I fight a lifetime of revolution for?' As he spoke, he walked angrily towards the main room and said to the nanny: 'From now on, Xiao Lan is not allowed to go out on Sundays, and no one is allowed to come and see her, studying is the most important thing.'
    "I cried for half the night."
    On another page, it was written: "I can't eat, my head is always dizzy and numb, I have insomnia at night, and I have a lot of dreams. Last night I dreamed that Dad was holding my rejection letter and walking towards me angrily. I was so scared that I cried, and if Mom hadn't woken me up, the consequences would have been terrible!
    "The League branch secretary talked to me, but I didn't mention the situation at home, because I was afraid people would laugh at Dad."
    I didn't want to read any further, and my heart felt heavy. I looked at Xiao Lan with sympathy. She was lying on the table, staring blankly at her schoolbag with tears in her eyes. Yes, she had lost a lot of weight, her eyes were larger, and her rosy apple cheeks now looked like they had been peeled and covered with a layer of white clay.
    "You should show this to your dad," I said.
    She quickly snatched the diary from my hand, saying:
    "No, never!"
    I didn't know how to comfort her, so I decided to talk to Section Chief Wang when he returned, but I didn't see him until it was dark. I couldn't wait any longer, I had to rush back to school to study.
    On the way back to school, I thought a lot. Why was Section Chief Wang doing this? If things continued like this, a lively and energetic girl would be ruined.

    爸爸的“关”
    哲中
    星期天进城看我过去的老上级。
    “不凑巧，处长他们看戏去了。”保姆话声很低，说话时老把眼珠望里屋瞟。
    “哈哈，你骗我……”我笑了，举步往里走。
    她忙拉住我，解释道：“小兰正在用功哩。”
    “今天是星期天呀！”
    小兰甩着两条小辫子跑出来。
    “您好，大学生同志！是什么风把您吹来的？考上大学了，架子大啦！”没等我回话，她就拉着我的手向里屋跑。
    保姆为难地站在门口。
    “快要把我闷死了！”她递一杯开水给我说，“可有什么办法呢？”
    这一切我都不懂。她笑了，发觉自己说的话没头没脑，坐下来从书包里取出一个日记本，送到我面前说：
    “看吧，您会明白的。”
    屋里有些暗，她打开台灯。我带着不安的心情读下去：
    “昨晚小辫辫要跟我睡。很久，我们都没有睡着。她说，从这学期起，她就失眠了，今年考学校很难。后来她哭了，怕考不上高中丢脸——丢自己的脸，丢爸妈的脸。我劝她也把自己劝哭了。她问我为什么哭，我说我也不知道。她说：‘你别骗我，你是怕考不取过不了你爸爸的关。’可不是吗，爸常说，他小时候家里穷没念多少书，现在一定要把我们姐妹俩念到大学。”
    又一天写着：“还没放下书包爸就叫我去。最近不知怎的一见到爸心就直跳。爸详细地问了我学习情况，要我加油干，不然‘危险’……。
    “爸的话像一块石头压在我心上。我多么需要他说一声在我万一考不取的时候怎样打算，可是他根本不想这一方面……。”
    我又翻过一页，上面写着：“今天校长为我们初三高三同学作了报告，要我们不要太紧张，就是升不了学也不见得丢脸，总有一些人考不上的。听了校长的报告，我恨不得一下变成开荒队员或者是工人、农业社员，献出我所有的力量，跟大家一起加油建设我们的祖国，使每一个人上学都不愁没有学校，到那时候，该多美啊！
    “晚饭后，该死的小辫辫又来要和我同睡。我们在房里叽叽咕咕的谈论校长的报告。没想到话被爸爸听到了，让妈来叫我。爸坐在床沿上，气得手上香烟灰向下直落。我怕死了，咬着辫梢不敢抬头。还是妈先说：‘孩子的想法也不坏呀，何必气成这样！’爸呼的暴跳起来：‘你就是这样关心儿女的呀？是哟，等小兰当上了工人……你做妈妈的多光彩啊。可惜你（面对着我）投错了胎，告诉你，今年你非得给我考上高中不可，否则你就别见我！懂吗？你是我的女儿！’妈耐着性子说：‘你这就不对，大家都要像你这样想……。’爸打断她的话说：‘像我怎样？干了一生革命为了啥？’说着，气抖抖地向堂屋走去，对保姆说：‘以后星期日不准小兰出门，也不许任何人来找她，念书要紧。’
    “我哭了半夜。”
    在另一页上，这样写着：“饭吃不下，头老晕麻，晚上失眠，多梦，昨晚梦见爸爸拿着我的没被录取的通知书气汹汹地向我走来，我吓哭了，要不是妈起来叫醒我，结果多可怕呀！
    “团支书找我谈，我没说在家里的事情，怕别人笑话爸爸。”
    我再不愿意读下去了，心里直发闷。我同情地看着小兰，她伏在桌子上，含着眼泪盯着书包出神。是的，她瘦了很多，眼大了，那红红的苹果脸蛋现在像给谁削去了皮，涂上一层白土灰。
    “你最好把它给你爸爸看一下。”我说。
    她忙从我手里夺过日记本，说：
    “不，绝不！”
    我不知怎样安慰她好，决心等王处长回来和他谈谈，但到天黑还没见人，不能再等了，我要赶回学校上自习哩。
    在回校的路上，我想了很多，王处长为什么要这样？这样下去，会把一个活蹦活跳的姑娘逼坏的。
