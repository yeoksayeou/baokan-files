Chairman Cyrankiewicz's Speech

Respected Premier Zhou Enlai, dear friends:

The moment our Polish government delegation set foot on Chinese soil, we received a warm welcome from the Chinese people and felt the deep friendship of the Chinese people towards the Polish people.

When Premier Zhou Enlai visited Poland, he had the opportunity to personally understand, and we also thank him for what he recently said at the Third Plenary Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, that every Polish person has a deep friendship towards the Chinese people.

The Polish people enthusiastically watched the victory in your liberation struggle, and now they are very happy to see the achievements of the Chinese people in the cause of socialist construction.

I should say that we Polish people, first of all, get to know your country and the great Chinese people from books, newspapers, movies, and from what Polish people who have been to China tell us. However, it is indeed impossible to fully understand the achievements of the Chinese people in building socialism through these means. One must see it with one's own eyes to understand the great changes taking place in China, and to understand the huge contributions made by the Chinese people to the cause of their motherland, to the cause of international solidarity, and to peace.

China certainly still has much work to do, but it is developing rapidly. This development is the foundation for the increasing status of the People's Republic of China, and it has a huge impact on Asia and the world.

It is clear that the establishment of the People's Republic of China and its increasing development have had, are having, and will have a historically significant impact that is beneficial to socialism and peace.

In that case, please allow me to say that it is also of great significance to the Polish people, because the development of the Polish people is inseparable from the development of socialism and peace forces.

We have visited some countries in Asia, but we cannot say that we have a deep understanding of the lives of these countries. These countries have only recently been liberated from the shackles of colonialism, but one thing is certain, and that is that we have absolutely confirmed our past belief: the disintegration of decadent colonialism is inevitable, and no matter what kind of doctrine is used to disguise it, it cannot prevent its collapse. We saw this in those countries.

The struggle for the status of the people of these countries is developing, and this development cannot be stopped there.

We must say that during our visit to these countries, we also strengthened the belief that this change cannot be stopped, to a large extent due to the very strong desire of the masses of people in these countries to strive for liberation, due to the existence of the great socialist camp and the first socialist country, the Soviet Union, due to the establishment and strengthening of the People's Republic of China, and due to the unity of the entire socialist camp. Some groups in these countries may not be very clear themselves that without the existence of the Soviet Union, without the existence of great China, and without the existence of the socialist camp, their struggle for independence would be brutally suppressed as in the past when they faced imperialism alone.

From this, we can see the great importance of the moral strength that the socialist camp gives to the liberation struggle of the people of all countries, no matter where this struggle is taking place. From this, we can see the great importance of the unity of the socialist camp on healthy principles.

We, together with the Chinese people, are working together in this region to consolidate peace, just as Premier Zhou said just now when he mentioned Poland's role in the International Supervisory Commission. The Polish people wholeheartedly support the efforts of the People's Republic of China, together with Asian peace-loving countries, to establish a collective security system in the Far East. Similarly, when we in Europe, together with other people's democratic countries and the Soviet Union, are fighting to establish a collective security system in Europe, we also receive the support of the Chinese people.

The Polish people are very grateful to the People's Republic of China for the support it has given us in order to strengthen our unshakable peaceful border in Europe—the Oder-Neisse border—through a collective security treaty. This support is embodied in the joint statement we signed with Comrade Zhou Enlai in Warsaw.

As a people who are building socialism, we are also very grateful to our Chinese comrades for the great understanding they have shown for the problems that exist in our Polish construction of socialism.

The friendship between the People's Republic of China and Poland in all aspects has become a very important factor in strengthening peace and the unity of the socialist camp.

Therefore, dear comrades, please allow me to propose:

    For the great Chinese people,
    For Sino-Polish friendship,
    For the health of Chairman Mao Zedong of the People's Republic of China,
    For the health of Premier Zhou Enlai, the host of today's banquet,
    For the health of everyone present,
    Cheers!

    西伦凯维兹主席的讲话
    敬爱的周恩来总理、敬爱的朋友们：
    我们波兰政府代表团一踏上中国领土，就受到中国人民热情的招待，就感到中国人民对波兰人民的深厚友谊。
    周恩来总理在访问波兰的时候，有机会亲自了解到，而且我们也感谢他最近在中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第三次全体会议上所讲的，就是每个波兰人民对中国人民都怀有很深的友谊。
    波兰人民曾经热情地注视着你们解放斗争中的胜利，现在又很高兴地看到中国人民在社会主义建设事业中的成就。
    我应该说，我们波兰人民，首先是从书本、报纸、电影，从到过中国的波兰人对我们所讲的，来认识你们的国家，认识伟大的中国人民。可是，通过这些的确是不能够充分了解中国人民建设社会主义中有什么样的成就，应该自己亲眼看一看，才能够了解在中国所发生的伟大的变化，才能够了解到中国人民为他们祖国的事业、为国际团结的事业，为和平所作的巨大的贡献。
    中国诚然还有许多工作要做，但是它已经是在一日千里地发展着。这种发展是中华人民共和国地位日益提高的基础，并且对于亚洲和世界有着巨大的影响。
    很显然，中华人民共和国的建立和它的日益发展，曾经产生过、现在和将来也会产生有利于社会主义和和平的具有历史意义的影响。
    既然如此，请允许我说，它对波兰人民也是有着巨大意义的，因为波兰人民的发展是同社会主义和和平力量的发展分不开的。
    我们曾经访问过亚洲的一些国家，但是，我们不能够说我们对这些国家的生活已经有了深刻的了解。这些国家不久前刚从殖民主义的枷锁下解放出来，但是，有一件事情是肯定的，那就是我们已经绝对地证实了我们过去的信念：腐朽的殖民主义的瓦解是不可避免的，而且不管用那一种主义来加以掩饰也不能够防止它的崩溃。我们在那些国家里看到了这一点。
    为了这些国家的人民的地位而进行的斗争正在发展中，并且在那里这种发展是不能够停止的。
    我们必须说，在我们访问这些国家期间，我们也加强了这种信念，就是这种变化之所以不能停止，在很大的程度上是由于这些国家的人民群众争取解放的非常强烈的愿望，由于伟大的社会主义阵营和第一个社会主义国家苏联的存在，由于中华人民共和国的建立和加强，并且由于整个社会主义阵营的团结一致。这些国家中的某些集团也许自己并不很清楚，如果没有苏联的存在、没有伟大的中国的存在和社会主义阵营的存在，他们的争取独立的斗争就会像过去单独地面对着帝国主义的时候那样残酷地被镇压。
    从这里可以看出，社会主义阵营给予各国人民解放斗争的道义的力量的巨大重要性，不论这种斗争是在那里进行。从这里可以看出，社会主义阵营在健康的原则上的团结的巨大重要性。
    我们同中国人民一起，正如同刚才周总理在提到波兰在国际监察委员会的作用的时候所说的，我们一同在这个地区为巩固和平而共同努力。波兰人民衷心地支持中华人民共和国同亚洲爱好和平的国家一起为在远东建立集体安全体系所作的努力，同样，我们在欧洲同其他人民民主国家、同苏联一道为建立欧洲的集体安全体系而斗争的时候，也得到中国人民的支持。
    波兰人民非常感谢中华人民共和国对于我们为了通过集体安全条约来加强我们的不可动摇的在欧洲的和平边界——奥得—尼斯河边界——所给我们的支持。这种支持体现在我们同周恩来同志在华沙签订的联合声明中。
    作为一个正在建设社会主义的人民，我们同样也感谢中国的同志们对于我们波兰建设社会主义的过程中所存在的问题所表现的巨大的谅解。
    中华人民共和国和波兰在各方面的友谊，已经成了加强和平和社会主义阵营团结的非常重要的因素。
    因此，亲爱的同志们，请允许我提议：
    为伟大的中国人民，
    为波中友谊，
    为中华人民共和国毛泽东主席的健康，
    为今天宴会的主人周恩来总理的健康，
　　为在座的诸位的健康，
    干杯！
