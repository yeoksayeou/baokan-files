    Moving from "Making Do" to "Being Particular"
    Liu Baifeng
    It was late at night when I left Da Bai's house. As I walked, I kept thinking about the last thing Da Bai had said to me: "Being particular" is different from "making do." Living standards can't be raised all at once; everything has to start with "making do" and then move towards "being particular."
    This was a Saturday evening. To understand how the masses were using cloth, I visited Bai Shuqin, the principal of Shatuyuan Primary School in the Qianmen District of Beijing (everyone calls her Da Bai). I knew Da Bai quite well. This capable woman in her thirties is not only a competent teacher but also a good homemaker.
    When I explained my purpose, Da Bai opened up: "Our family's cloth usage is very simple; we never use up all the cloth coupons we get each year." As she spoke, she paused, as if afraid I wouldn't believe her, and took out a pile of evidence from a drawer—a package of leftover cloth coupons. "These are the cloth coupons left over from the past two years. The year before last, I gave over ninety feet to a friend, and last year I also gave some to others." I took these leftover cloth coupons and counted them. There were eighty-four feet left over from 1956, and some left over from 1955 as well. I found this a bit strange: some people always complain that cloth coupons aren't enough, so why did Da Bai's family have so many left over each year? Could it be that they didn't care about their clothing? Looking at their clothes, they weren't bad at all. Da Bai was wearing a half-new blue cloth top and woolen trousers; the two children were also dressed neatly. So, why couldn't they use up all these cloth coupons? While I was pondering this question, Da Bai's husband, Lao Xie, returned from outside. He was wearing a half-new blue cloth casual cotton-padded jacket, which looked both neat and simple. When he saw me holding the package of cloth coupons, he immediately said, "These cloth coupons are all leftover."
    Before last year's wage adjustment, Da Bai's salary was relatively low, and the whole family used at most thirty feet of cloth coupons a year. However, the family still dressed neatly. But their "being particular" was different from some people's. For example, each of the two children had a set of relatively good clothes. These clothes were always saved for the New Year, festivals, and outings. The children have also developed frugal habits, wearing whatever they have and cherishing their clothes. When the older child outgrows their clothes, they are altered for the younger child to wear. At the same time, they always buy some dye to dye clothes that have been worn for a long time and faded, making them look new again; they alter old-fashioned clothes into more stylish and fitting ones; and they wear clothes that can no longer be worn outside inside. Da Bai pointed to a red jacket worn by her second child and said, "This jacket was made when she was only one and a half years old. Now she is six years old. Although this jacket is shorter and smaller, we've made the sides wider and lengthened the sleeves, so it can still be worn inside. If we were to buy everything new, both inside and out, not only would our financial condition not allow it, but it would also be unnecessary."
    Last year, Da Bai received a pay raise, from the original fifty-odd yuan to seventy-odd yuan. Like other families, they bought a lot of new clothes last year—she and her husband both got new cotton-padded clothes, and the two children each got a set of new cotton-padded clothes and several single-layer garments. According to Da Bai, last year was the year they bought the most clothes, using about sixty feet of cloth coupons. However, the state issued her family one hundred and sixty-four feet of cloth coupons last year (Da Bai fifty-six feet, and each family member thirty-six feet). They used about sixty feet to make clothes and gave some away, which explains where the remaining eighty-four feet of cloth coupons from last year came from.
    We talked at Da Bai's house until almost ten o'clock. By this time, the children were sleepy, but Da Bai became more and more animated as she talked. Finally, she said to me, "Comrade! 'Being particular' is different from 'making do.' Living standards can't be raised too quickly. Everything has to start with 'making do' and then move towards 'being particular.' For example, when it comes to clothing, we can't buy so many new clothes every year. Last year, we all bought a lot of clothes. This summer, except for buying Lao Xie a jacket, we won't be buying anything else."

### 要从“将就”里面去“讲究”

    要从“将就”里面去“讲究”
    刘柏枫
    从大白家里出来，夜已经深了。我一边走，一边在想着大白最后同我谈的那句话：“讲究”同“将就”不同，生活不能一下子提高，什么事总得从“将就”里面去“讲究”。
    这是一个星期六的晚上。为了了解群众用布的情况，我访问了北京市前门区沙土园小学校长白淑琴（大家都叫她大白）。大白我是比较熟悉的，这位三十多岁的妇女不但是一个能干的女教师，还是一个善于治家的好主妇。
    当我提出来意以后，大白就拉开了话匣子：“我们家里用布的情况很简单，每年发的布票总是用不完。”说着，她停了一下，好像怕我不相信似的，从抽屉里拿出了一堆证据——一包剩余的布票。“这是这两年内剩下来的布票。前年我给了一个朋友九十多尺，去年也给了人家一点。”我接过这些剩余的布票一清点，1956年度剩余了八十四尺，1955年度也剩了一些。我觉得有些奇怪：有些人老叫布票不够用，大白家里为什么每年剩余这许多布票呢？难道他们家不讲究穿衣？一看他们的穿着并不坏，大白身上穿一件半新的蓝布上衣，一条呢子裤；两个孩子穿的也很整齐。那末，这些布票为什么用不完呢？我正在想这个问题的时候，大白的爱人老谢从外面回来了。他上身穿了一件半新的青布便式棉衣，显得既整齐又朴实。他看见我拿着这一包布票，马上说：“这些布票都是剩下的。”
    去年调整工资以前，大白的薪金收入比较少，全家一年顶多用三十尺布票。但是，他们一家人还是穿的很整齐。不过，他们的讲究同有些人的讲究不太一样。比如：两个孩子各人都有一套比较好的衣服。这套衣服总是留着过年过节、出外游玩的时候穿。孩子们也养成了俭朴习惯，有什么就穿什么，也很爱惜衣服。大孩子穿小了的衣服，就改给二孩子穿。同时，他们家总是把一些穿久褪了色的衣服，买一点染料染一下，看起来又像新的一样；把一些式样老了的旧衣服改成合时合身的衣服；外面穿不成了的衣服，就套在里面穿。大白指着二孩子身上穿的一件红色小褂说：“这件小褂还是她一周岁半的时候做的，现在六周岁了，这件衣虽然短了小了，可是把两胁改大一点，袖子接长，套在里面还是可以将就穿的。如果里也添，外也添，莫说经济条件不允许，同时也不必要。”
    去年，大白增薪了，由原来的五十多元增到七十多元。同别人家一样，他们去年添置了不少新衣服，——她和她爱人都添了新棉衣，两个孩子各人添了一套新棉服和几件单衣。据大白说，去年是他们家添置衣服最多的一年，大约用了六十来尺布票。但是，国家去年发给他家一百六十四尺布票（大白五十六尺，家里人各三十六尺），做衣服用去六十来尺，送给人家一些，这样，去年剩余的八十四尺布票就有了来历了。
    在大白家一直谈到近十点钟，这时候，孩子们都有了睡意，大白却愈谈愈有精神。最后，她向我说：“同志！‘讲究’和‘将就’不同，生活不能一下子提的太高，什么事总得要从‘将就’里面去‘讲究’，比方说穿衣吧，总不能每年都添置那么多新衣。去年我们都添置了不少衣服，今年夏天除了给老谢添一件褂子以外，其它都没有什么添置了。”
