	Bearing the Responsibility of Justice on Iron Shoulders
	Jia Zhi
	Since its inaugural issue, the "Morning Bell" newspaper has changed a warning phrase daily on the small ancient bell above the editorial; the warning phrase for the sixth issue quoted Yang Jisheng of the Ming Dynasty:
		Bearing the responsibility of justice on iron shoulders.
	Comrade Li Dazhao left very few calligraphic works. Last year, a couplet he gave to a relative was found in his hometown, which happened to contain the same words, with a second line as well; the full text is:
		Bearing the responsibility of justice on iron shoulders,
		Creating brilliant articles with skillful hands.
	Yang Jisheng's original words were "Bearing the responsibility of justice on iron shoulders, writing scathing articles with a fierce hand." Comrade Li Dazhao changed the word "fierce" to "skillful". I think these two changed sentences can very well explain Comrade Li Dazhao's character; and "Bearing the responsibility of justice on iron shoulders" fully expresses his heroic spirit of dedicating himself to the revolution without shirking any hard work or sacrifice.
	The "Morning Bell" newspaper was the first publication personally designed and edited by Comrade Li Dazhao after returning from studying in Japan; he rang the "Morning Bell," hoping to awaken the nation's thorough "self-awareness" and establish an ideal, young China. He said: "Each strike triggers a sound, each sound awakens one dream"; he so eagerly hoped that people would become young and possess the spirit of "Bearing the responsibility of justice on iron shoulders." Comrade Li Dazhao did not usually enjoy painting or calligraphy, but only when he had more leisure in his early work period did he occasionally write a couple of scrolls or couplets for relatives and friends living at home. This couplet is one of the only calligraphic works left in this way, without elaborate engraved seals or dates. And it is precisely these casually scribbled things that unconsciously reveal his great aspirations and state of mind. Looking back at Comrade Li Dazhao's short life of only thirty-nine years, from a young age, he harbored great ambitions and loved writing poetry, regarding seeking the truth to save the nation from peril as his sacred duty.
	Comrade Li Dazhao spent several days and nights in Tokyo writing the "Warning to the Elders of the Nation," opposing Yuan Shikai's recognition of the "Twenty-One Demands" by which the Japanese imperialists sought to destroy China; the voluminous document shows his loud appeals and burning concern. He never bowed to the old forces, "those who follow different paths cannot make plans together," and resolutely broke with old friends, going their separate ways; his departure from the "Morning Bell" newspaper is one example. He was not afraid of being labeled an "extremist" and joyfully hailed the victory of the October Socialist Revolution with great pleasure; he quickly found Marxism, the key to seeking freedom and happiness for the people. His personal life was arduous and simple, disapproving of extravagance and waste, and not indulging in any bad habits. He felt very uncomfortable seeing immoral criminal behaviors such as theft and prostitution in the old society, but he did not simply negate things, but always thought and researched from the perspective of the social system. He was confident in his "firm integrity to be maintained alone" and would never associate with bad people or deeds. The superiority of his character and morality was even unanimously praised by reactionary newspapers after his martyrdom to blindfold the public. He was truly worthy of being called a "man of determination who tasted gall while lying on firewood," determined to reform society.
	Comrade Li Dazhao painstakingly cultivated young people and sowed the seeds of revolution; he led the masses in patriotic struggles and secret revolutionary activities, always standing at the forefront of the struggle; he was a university professor, but he did not covet a comfortable life, instead becoming an excellent representative of workers and peasants. For a glorious and lofty ideal, he had no fear of the White Terror of the reactionary warlords. He demonstrated the fighting spirit to break through all dark nets. Until the end, the enemy used the most cruel method against him, also the first time in Chinese history – hanging. He was the first of the twenty martyred comrades to step onto the execution platform. In front of the gallows, he remained calm, declaring that communism would ultimately triumph.
	Indeed, the phrase "Bearing the responsibility of justice on iron shoulders" vividly expresses Comrade Li Dazhao's entire revolutionary spirit. For the freedom and happiness of the people, he personally demanded nothing, but bravely shouldered his responsibilities until his own blood flowed. It is impossible not to think of the Greek mythological giant Atlas, who bent over and carried the celestial sphere alone. Comrade Li Dazhao's spirit of bearing the responsibility of justice on iron shoulders is comparable to this.
	In 1924, when Comrade Li Dazhao went to Guangzhou to participate in the First National Congress of the Kuomintang and passed through Hunan, he gave a lecture at the invitation of the Hunan Teachers' Federation. For remembrance, the Teachers' Federation presented Comrade Li Dazhao with a pair of lead tea canisters, cast with four characters: "Morality and Writing." This assessment of Comrade Li Dazhao is precisely an abbreviation of "Bearing the responsibility of justice on iron shoulders, creating brilliant articles with skillful hands."

    铁肩担道义
    贾芝
    “晨钟报”从创刊号起，每天在社论前面的那口小小的古钟上换一句警语，第六号的警语，是引用明朝杨继盛的一句话：
          铁肩担道义
    李大钊同志遗留下的墨迹是很少的。去年从他的故乡找到了他赠给亲戚的一副对联，上面恰好也写着同样的话，而还有后一句，全文是：
            铁肩担道义
            妙手著文章
    杨继盛的原话，本来是“铁肩担道义，辣手著文章”，李大钊同志把“辣”字改成了一个“妙”字。我觉得改过的这两句话，很能说明李大钊同志一生的为人；而“铁肩担道义”，更充分表现了他的献身革命不辞一切劳苦牺牲的英雄气概。
      “晨钟报”是李大钊同志从日本留学回国后亲自设计和主编的第一个报刊；他敲起“晨钟”来，希望唤起民族的彻底的“自觉”，建立一个理想的年轻的中国。他说：“一一扣发一一声，一一声觉一一梦”；他是那么迫切地希望人们都能年轻起来，都具有“铁肩担道义”的精神。李大钊同志平生并不喜弄书画，只是在早一个时期工作较有空暇的时候，偶尔给住在家里的亲友写一两副中堂或对联，上面这副对联，就是这样留下来的仅有的墨迹之一，没有讲究刻工的图章，也没有个年月。而正是这样随便挥几笔的东西，又无心地流露了他的伟大的抱负和心境。回顾一下李大钊同志只有三十九岁的短短的一生，从年轻时代起，他就胸怀大志，喜作诗文，把寻求挽救民族的危亡的真理，看成了自己的天职。
    李大钊同志在东京费了几昼夜工夫写的那篇“警告全国父老书”，反对袁世凯承认日寇灭亡中国的“二十一条”，洋洋万言，可以看出他的大声疾呼忧心如焚。他丝毫不肯向旧势力低头，“道不同，不相谋”，和老朋友毅然决裂，各走一路的事，有过不止一桩；他离开“晨钟报”，就是一个例子。他不怕被诬为“过激党”，以极大的愉快欢呼了十月社会主义革命的胜利；他很快找到了马克思主义这把为人民寻求自由和幸福的钥匙。他个人的生活是艰苦朴素的，看不惯奢华浪费的行为，也不沾染任何不良嗜好。看见旧社会里发生的偷盗、宿娼一类不道德的罪恶行为，他是很难受的，却也不简单地否定了事，而总是从社会制度上思考研究。他自信有“自信独守的坚操”，绝不与坏人坏事同流合污。他的人品道德的高超，连反动报纸在他殉难以后为了遮人眼睛，也只好一致称赞。他实在够得上说是一个“卧薪尝胆”，立志改革社会的“仁人志士”。
    李大钊同志苦心培养青年，撒播革命的种子；他领导群众进行爱国斗争和秘密的革命活动，一直是站在斗争的最前列；他是大学教授，但他没有贪图安逸生活，却成了工人农民的优秀的代表人物。为了一个辉煌的崇高理想，他对于反动军阀的白色恐怖，没有丝毫惧怕过。他表现了冲决一切黑暗罗网的战斗精神。直到最后，敌人对待他使用了最残酷、也是中国历史上第一次出现的杀人方法——绞刑，他是同难的二十位战友中头一个走上刑台的，在绞架面前，他依然态度镇静，声明共产主义终必胜利。
    的确，“铁肩担道义”一句话，淋漓尽致地表现了李大钊同志的全部革命精神。他为了人民的自由和幸福，个人毫不索取什么，只是勇敢地担负了自己的责任，直到流出自己的鲜血。让人不禁想起希腊神话里的一位巨人阿忒拉斯来，这位大力士弯腰弓背，独自扛着天体。李大钊同志的这种铁肩担道义的精神，是可以相与媲美的。
    1924年，李大钊同志到广州去参加国民党第一次代表大会路过湖南，应湖南教职员联谊会的邀请，作了一次讲演。为了留念，教职员联谊会赠给了李大钊同志一对铅制的茶叶瓶，上面铸有四个字：“道德文章”。这个对于李大钊同志的评语，恰好又是“铁肩担道义，妙手著文章”的缩写。
