    The Tragedy of the New School Year in South Korea
    The new school year in South Korea starts in April. Recently, newspapers have been filled with tragic stories of students and parents experiencing hardship and suicide because they cannot afford the exorbitant tuition fees.
    Here are two examples. In Seoul, a sixty-year-old father committed suicide in March because he could not pay the 70,000 won (the official rate is 500 won to the US dollar) tuition fee for his daughter to attend school. In Yeongdeungpo, near Seoul, a sixteen-year-old student was arrested by the police for extorting money from a merchant to pay for his tuition.
    Many Bounced Checks in Tokyo
    According to a recent announcement by the Tokyo Clearing House, an average of 2,123 bounced checks are appearing daily in the Tokyo Clearing House in March, an increase of 12% compared to the same period last year.
    The "Tokyo Shimbun" said that the large number of bounced checks reflects the dangers lurking in Japan's economic situation.
    Smoking and Lung Cancer
    According to the April 1st issue of "Time" magazine, a recent report released by the US National Cancer Institute, the National Heart Institute, the Cancer Society, and the Heart Association stated that people who smoke half a pack or more of cigarettes a day are on average five to fifteen times more likely to develop lung cancer than non-smokers, and people who smoke two packs of cigarettes a day are on average twenty-seven times more likely to develop lung cancer than non-smokers. However, some other scientists are skeptical.

    南朝鲜新学年的悲剧
    南朝鲜的新学年从4月份开始，最近在报纸上不断出现学生和家长因为缴纳不起巨额学费而发生悲剧性事件的新闻。
    有这样两个例子。在汉城，有一个六十岁的父亲在3月间自杀，因为他付不出他女儿进学校的七万圜（官价为五百圜合一美元）学费。在汉城附近的永登浦，有一个十六岁的学生向一个商人勒索款项来缴纳学费，结果被警察逮捕。
    东京空头支票多
    据东京票据交换所最近发表，在东京票据交换所3月份每天平均要出现二千一百二十三张空头支票，比去年同期增加了12％。
    “东京新闻”说，空头支票的大量出现，反映了在日本经济形势中潜伏着的危险。
    吸烟和肺癌
    据4月1日的“时代”周刊报道，美国的全国癌症研究所、全国心脏病研究所、癌症学会和心脏病协会最近发表的一个报告说，一个每天抽半包或半包以上的烟的人患肺癌的可能性比不吸烟的人平均大五倍到十五倍，每天吸两包烟的人患肺癌的可能性比不吸烟的人平均大二十七倍。但另外有些科学家都抱怀疑态度。
