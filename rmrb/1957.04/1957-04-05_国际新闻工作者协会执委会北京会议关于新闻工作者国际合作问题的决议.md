Xinhua News Agency, April 4th. The Executive Committee of the International Organization of Journalists passed the following resolution on the issue of international cooperation of journalists at its Beijing meeting:

	I. The Enlarged Meeting of the Executive Committee of the International Organization of Journalists notes with satisfaction the fruitful work done by the member organizations of the International Organization of Journalists in developing international cooperation among journalists. In order to implement the resolutions of the Helsinki International Meeting of Journalists, all member organizations of the International Organization of Journalists invited journalists who did not participate in the International Organization of Journalists but participated in this meeting to visit their own countries, giving them full opportunities to familiarize themselves with the lives of the people. A large number of journalists from the Americas, Asia, Western Europe, and African countries visited socialist countries, traveled, and met with the people. Member organizations participated in the meetings of the International Committee for Cooperation of Journalists. The Executive Committee of the International Organization of Journalists has consistently supported the suggestions made by this committee regarding meetings between the International Organization of Journalists and representatives of the International Federation of Journalists to strengthen international cooperation among journalists.

	The Executive Committee of the International Organization of Journalists reaffirms its determination to make its utmost efforts to implement the resolutions of the Helsinki International Meeting of Journalists, which have opened up avenues for broad cooperation among journalists of all countries, regardless of their political systems.

	II. The Executive Committee is particularly pleased to see that member organizations of the International Organization of Journalists are striving for friendly cooperation in their affairs, especially the conclusion of bilateral agreements between individual organizations that are members of the International Organization of Journalists and those that are not. The mutual visits of journalists between certain newspapers with similar professional interests have produced good results. The Executive Committee of the International Organization of Journalists draws the attention of member organizations to the desire to expand and strengthen cooperation in the current aspects of journalistic work, as well as in cultivating the professional competence of journalists and developing journalistic theory.

	III. The Executive Committee of the International Organization of Journalists suggests that member organizations actively participate in the planned international conferences of agricultural journalists and interviewers. Such representative meetings can serve as an important means of strengthening cooperation among journalists and improving their professional capabilities.

	IV. The Executive Committee of the International Organization of Journalists believes that meetings and conferences held by journalists on a professional basis in various parts of the world are conducive to mutual understanding and cooperation among journalists. The Executive Committee is prepared to welcome and support the efforts made by journalists from any country or several countries in any part of the world to achieve this goal.

	V. The Executive Committee of the International Organization of Journalists calls on all member organizations to vigorously support the efforts made by the International Committee for Cooperation of Journalists, established at the Helsinki International Meeting, to expand and strengthen international cooperation among journalists.

    国际新闻工作者协会执委会北京会议关于新闻工作者国际合作问题的决议
    新华社4日讯　国际新闻工作者协会执行委员会北京会议通过关于新闻工作者国际合作问题的决议如下：
    一、国际新闻工作者协会执行委员会扩大会议满意地指出，国际新闻工作者协会会员组织在发展新闻工作者之间的国际合作方面做了有成果的工作。国际新闻工作者协会所有各会员组织为了执行赫尔辛基国际新闻工作者会见的决议，邀请了没有参加国际新闻工作者协会而参加这次会见的新闻工作者到自己国内去访问，给他们充分的机会熟悉人民的生活。美洲、亚洲、西欧和非洲国家的大批记者访问了社会主义国家，作了旅行，同人民见面。各会员组织参加了国际新闻工作者合作委员会会议。国际新闻工作者协会执行委员会过去和现在一直支持这个委员会提出的关于国际新闻工作者协会同国际新闻工作者联合会代表会见，以加强国际新闻工作者合作的建议。
    国际新闻工作者协会执行委员会重申自己的决心：要尽最大的努力来实现赫尔辛基国际新闻工作者会见的决议，这些决议为各国——不问它的政治制度如何——新闻工作者的广泛合作开辟了道路。
    二、执行委员会特别满意地看到，国际新闻工作者协会会员组织之间努力在事务上进行友好合作，特别是参加国际新闻工作者协会的和未参加这个协会的个别组织之间缔结了双边协定。某些在专业方面相接近的报纸之间，互派记者访问，产生了良好的结果。国际新闻工作者协会执行委员会提请会员组织注意在目前的新闻工作方面以及在培养新闻工作者的业务能力和发展新闻理论方面扩大和加强合作的愿望。
    三、国际新闻工作者协会执行委员会建议会员组织积极参加已计划举行的农业新闻工作者和采访记者的国际会议。这类的代表会议可以作为加强记者的合作和提高记者业务能力的一种重要形式。
    四、国际新闻工作者协会执行委员会认为，新闻工作者在世界各地在职业基础上举行会见和会议，有助于新闻工作者之间的相互了解和合作。执行委员会准备欢迎和支持世界上任何部分的任何一个国家或者一些国家的新闻工作者为达到这一目的而作的努力。
    五、国际新闻工作者协会执行委员会号召所有会员组织竭力支持在赫尔辛基国际会见时成立的国际新闻工作者合作委员会在扩大和加强新闻工作者国际合作方面所作的努力。
