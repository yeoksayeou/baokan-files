Xinhua News Agency report: A new canal project, sixty *li* long, from Jieshou to Gaoyou in northern Jiangsu Province, is under intense construction.

In recent years, the sixty-*li* section from Jieshou to Gaoyou has been unable to meet the needs of farmland irrigation due to the shallow and narrow riverbed and steep and winding waterways, which limit water conveyance. During the dry season, the river surface is only 20 meters wide and less than 2 meters deep, making it impossible for ships and larger wooden boats to pass. This section has historically had many well-known hazards on the eastern bank and borders the vast Gaobao Lake on the western bank; therefore, flood control work is extremely heavy during the flood season. The new canal project is expected to be completed before the flood season this year. Once completed and put into operation, it will not only fundamentally eliminate the hazards of the river embankment in this section but will also greatly improve irrigation and navigation conditions.

    江苏北部修运河
    据新华社讯　江苏省北部从界首到高邮六十里长的新运河工程正在紧张施工。
    近几年来，界首到高邮长六十里的一段由于河床浅窄，河道陡曲，输水不多，不能满足农田灌溉的需要。在枯水期内，河面只有二十公尺宽，水深不足两公尺，轮船和较大的木船都无法通过。这一段在东堤方面历史上有名的险患很多，在西堤方面紧靠着湖面很阔的高宝湖；因而每逢汛期，防汛工作非常繁重。新运河工程预计在今年汛期以前完成，完成之后即行放水，不但可以基本上消除这一段河堤的险患，而且在灌溉和航运方面也将大大改观。
