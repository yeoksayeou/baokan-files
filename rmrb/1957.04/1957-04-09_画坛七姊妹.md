In Chengdu's art circles, the Zhu family's seven sisters (Wan Jun, Shou Jun, Pei Jun, Ren Jun, Wei Jun, Han Jun, and Jun Rui) have established a unique style of meticulous flower-and-bird painting. Whether it's the exquisite and charming chrysanthemums or the radiant hibiscus, their works are filled with touching vitality, leaving a lasting impression on viewers. In recent years, the Zhu sisters' traditional Chinese paintings have been featured in numerous art exhibitions, with several pieces receiving awards. "Insects and Chrysanthemums," a collaboration by Pei Jun, Wei Jun, and Ren Jun, and "Hibiscus and Carp," a solo work by Pei Jun, have been acquired by the state and will be sent abroad for exhibition along with works by other painters.

The seven Zhu sisters, sharing the same grandfather but different fathers, are all quite young. The youngest, Jun Rui, is twenty-one years old this year, and the eldest, Wan Jun, is only thirty-eight. Most of them have undergone years of diligent study. Pei Jun, who has achieved greater success, has been studying continuously for twenty years since the age of twelve.

Wei Jun's father, Zhu Zhuxiu, was well-versed in painting theory, and Pei Jun's uncle's house had a "Yu Garden" with thousands of varieties of chrysanthemums. Therefore, the sisters loved flowers and plants from a young age and enjoyed painting. At that time, imitation was prevalent in Chengdu's traditional Chinese painting circles. The Pei Jun sisters were unwilling to follow their old path. Whenever the "Yu Garden" was in full bloom, the sisters would follow Zhu Zhuxiu to sketch from life. They would move flower pots to the painting table, or simply sit next to the flowerbed, observing and painting. After three years of tireless practice, they painted one hundred chrysanthemums of different varieties and poses, and also developed skillful techniques.

In their early paintings, they followed conventional methods, outlining the lines and immediately applying color. The resulting petals always appeared thin and unreal. After repeated deliberation, they tried applying a layer of powder to the outlined petals before coloring them. The petals painted in this way gave a three-dimensional feeling, as if they were about to droop off the paper. Later, the traditional Chinese painter Zhang Daqian came to Chengdu, and Zhu Zhuxiu invited him to see the flowers painted by his daughters and nieces. After looking at them, Zhang Daqian said that their painting method was similar to the long-lost Song Dynasty powder-application technique. He praised their skill in painting chrysanthemum flower heads, but pointed out that the leaves in the paintings were monotonous and flat, and did not match the graceful flower heads. The sisters took the paintings to consult with flower growers, who shook their heads and said the leaves didn't look right. It turned out that the leaves of each type of flower had its own unique shape and posture, rarely being the same. When sketching, they only paid attention to the flower heads and did not carefully observe the leaves, so the leaves of one hundred different chrysanthemums were mostly similar.

From then on, the sisters became very careful and conscientious in their paintings, daring not to be negligent. After long-term observation, they indeed discovered the unique beauty of various leaves, and the leaves in their paintings became more realistic and moving. However, despite their hard work, society did not pay much attention to them.

In 1953, four "Chrysanthemums" painted in collaboration by Pei Jun, Ren Jun, and Wei Jun were sent to Beijing by the relevant authorities to participate in the first National Traditional Chinese Painting Exhibition, attracting the attention of Comrade Zhu De. After learning that these were the works of several young female painters, Comrade Zhu De asked a comrade working in Chengdu to convey his regards to them, encouraging them to study and create diligently.

Among the seven sisters, Zhu Pei Jun has become a professional painter, specializing in painting at home. When several *Davidia involucrata* trees transplanted from high-altitude areas bloomed in Chengdu People's Park last year, Pei Jun lingered under the flowers for seven or eight days, carefully studying their expression and posture. She also consulted several veteran painters and produced thirty-six different sketches. Finally, she selected the best one, "Phoenix Playing with *Davidia involucrata* Flowers." This painting was soon selected as the cover of a magazine and was well-received by the audience. The publishing house also reproduced many copies for distribution. Wan Jun, Wei Jun, Ren Jun, and Shou Jun were invited by relevant departments to enter the Shu Brocade Cooperative and the Shu Crepe Cooperative last year to specialize in art design. With the help of veteran artisans, they collected many Shu brocades from the Song Dynasty onwards from museums and the folk, learning the design art of ancient artisans. They newly designed more than ten patterns that are deeply loved by the masses. Han Jun and Jun Rui work in government agencies. They have been learning to paint for a shorter time, and their skills are not as good as their older sisters. Whenever they have free time, they pick up their brushes and study particularly diligently.

Although the seven sisters now live in different places, they still gather at Pei Jun's residence every day after work to study and create together. They have already brewed their future creative plans. They plan to complete the one hundred "Chrysanthemums," which they have been working on for a long time, with their main efforts in the next two or three years, preparing to hold an exhibition of "One Hundred Chrysanthemums." In addition, Pei Jun also plans to write a theoretical work called "Flower and Plant Compendium." She said that this book will be a summary of the experiences and lessons learned from their seven sisters' exploration of painting over the past twenty years.

    画坛七姊妹
    新华社记者　喻权域
    在成都美术界，朱氏七姊妹（婉君、寿君、佩君、纫君、炜君、含君和君蕊）的工笔花卉自成一个流派。她们的作品，不论是玲珑娇媚的菊花，还是光采照人的芙蓉，都洋溢着动人的生趣，使人看了久久不忘。近几年来，朱氏姊妹的国画参加过多次美术展览会，有好几幅画受到过奖励。佩君、炜君、纫君三人合作的“虫菊图”和佩君单独作的“芙蓉鲤鱼”，已为国家收购，将和别的画家的作品一起送到国外展览。
    同祖不同父的朱氏七姊妹年纪都不大，最小的君蕊今年二十一岁，最大的婉君也不过三十八岁。她们大都经过多年刻苦钻研，其中成就较大的佩君，从十二岁起，就连续不断地学习了二十年。
    炜君的父亲朱竹修精通画理，佩君的伯父家里有一个种着几千种菊花的“余园”。因此，姊妹们从小就爱花草，喜欢绘画。当时成都的国画界，模仿之风很盛。佩君姊妹们不愿意走他们的老路。每当“余园”里万花开放，姊妹们便跟着朱竹修前去写生。她们把花盆移在画桌前，或者就干脆坐到花圃旁边，一面看一面画。经过三年不倦的习作，她们画成了一百幅品种不同、姿态各异的菊花，同时也练成了巧妙的技法。
    初画时，她们按照习惯方法，勾好线条立刻上色，画出来的花瓣总显得单薄，不真实。反复揣摩，试着在勾好线条的花瓣上先打一层粉，然后上色。这样画出的花瓣给人以立体的感觉，好像要从纸上垂下来。后来，国画家张大千到了成都，朱竹修请他去看女儿和侄女们画的花卉。张大千看了以后说，她们所用的画法和失传已久的宋代结粉法相似，并称赞她们画菊花的花头的技巧，但画上的叶子单调平淡，和婀娜多姿的花头很不相称。姊妹们把画拿去请教种花人，种花人摇摇头，连说叶子不像。原来，每种花的叶子都有各自的形状和姿态，很少雷同。她们写生时只注意花头，没有仔细观察叶子，所以一百幅不同的菊花，叶子大都相似。
    从此以后，姊妹们作画都非常仔细认真，不敢苟且。经过长期观察，她们果然发现各种叶子独特的美，笔下的叶片也更真实更动人了。但是，尽管她们刻苦努力，社会上并没有怎样注意她们。
    1953年，佩君、纫君和炜君三人合作的四幅“菊花”，被有关机关送到北京参加全国第一届国画展览会，引起了朱德同志的注意。朱德同志知道这是几个青年女画家的作品后，托一个到成都工作的同志向她们致意，勉励她们好好学习和创作。
    七姊妹中，朱佩君成了职业画家，专门在家作画。去年成都人民公园从高寒地带移植来的几株栱桐花开放时，佩君在花下徘徊了七、八天，细心揣摩它的神态姿容，又请教了几个老画家，作出了三十六张不同的画稿。最后从中选出了最好的一幅“桐花凤戏栱桐花。”这幅画不久便被一家杂志选作封面，受到观众欢迎。出版社也复制了很多张发行。婉君、炜君、纫君和寿君四人应有关部门邀请，去年进了蜀锦合作社和蜀绉合作社，专门作美术设计。她们在老艺人帮助下，从博物馆和民间搜集了宋朝以来的许多蜀锦，学习古代艺人的设计艺术，新设计了十多种深为群众喜爱的图案。含君和君蕊在机关里工作，她俩学画时间较短，技巧不如姐姐，一有空闲便拿起画笔，学习得特别勤奋。
    七个姊妹现在虽然分住各处，可是每天下班以后，仍是聚到佩君的住处去一道学习创作。她们已经酝酿好了今后的创作计划。打算在二、三年内，以主要力量完成动笔已久的一百幅“菊花”，准备举办“百菊图”的展览。此外，佩君还打算写一本名为“花卉谱”的理论著作。她说，这本书将是二十年来她们七姊妹学画中摸索得来的经验教训的总结。
