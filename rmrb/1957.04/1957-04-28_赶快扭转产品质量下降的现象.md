    In the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement of 1956, many industrial enterprises not only saved raw materials but also ensured or improved product quality. This was a significant experience and achievement. However, in the currently flourishing Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement, some enterprises have not continued to promote this experience, resulting in a decline in product quality. For example, in the first quarter of this year, among 170 products in Shanghai's light industry and textile industry, 45 experienced a decline in quality. Among the 35 major products of enterprises under the Second Industrial Bureau of Shenyang City, more than 10, including enamel basins, rubber shoes, thermometers, and coated paper, have declined in quality. Guaranteeing and improving the quality of industrial products is a major matter that concerns national industrialization and the people's livelihood. From the perspective of the use value of products, guaranteeing and improving quality and extending its service life is the greatest saving; conversely, shortening the service life of products or even rendering them unusable is the greatest waste. Therefore, improving product quality is an unwavering policy for any socialist enterprise. If product quality is poor, even if a lot of raw materials are saved, it violates the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy.
    Why has the quality of products in some enterprises declined during the vigorous Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement? Some say it is because the quality of raw materials supplied this year is not good. However, only a portion of enterprises have failed to meet last year's standards due to poor raw material quality. Many enterprises have shortcomings in their technical and management work: whether raw materials and products are good or bad, there are no necessary instruments to test, and there is no standard to measure. Everything relies on looking, touching, smelling, and listening, so product quality is often in a state of fluctuating highs and lows. If they are making old products, or if the raw materials are relatively good, the product quality will also be better; if they are making new products, or if the quality of raw materials changes, the product quality will decline. The decline in product quality in some enterprises in the first quarter is precisely because technical and management work did not improve accordingly after raw materials and varieties changed. There is no doubt that this situation should be changed and can be changed.
    In some enterprises, especially in light industry and handicraft industry enterprises, there is a seemingly correct saying that in the case of insufficient raw material supply and the inability of products to meet demand, the state and enterprises should first consider the issue of the "existence" or "non-existence" of products, that is, the quantity issue, and can disregard the issue of "good" or "bad". Under this excuse, there has been a deviation towards simply pursuing "sparse," "thin," "fine," and "light." For example, some cotton textile mills, in order to weave more cloth, have made the yarn finer, but have not correspondingly increased the warp and weft threads, resulting in cloth that is sparse, thin, and not durable. Some machine factories, in order to save steel, have arbitrarily changed product designs, resulting in machines with reduced service life or even rendering them unusable. Obviously, this practice of only emphasizing quantity and neglecting quality when products cannot meet demand is very wrong. Because, first, if any product cannot guarantee a certain quality, it will bring losses to consumers and cause waste of resources to the country. Second, means of production products are used for construction or production. When we build a factory and produce a product, we must ensure that it is suitable, durable, and economical, which requires qualified equipment, tools, and raw materials. If equipment, tools, and raw materials are insufficient, we would rather cut back on plans than produce shoddy goods. Consumer goods are meant to meet the needs of the people's lives. Consumers want to buy cheap and good-quality products. Consumers do not welcome things that are expensive but not beautiful (not durable). Especially for industrial products purchased in fixed quantities, such as cotton cloth, consumers have particularly strict requirements for product quality. This year, some cotton textile mills in Liaoning could not sell their products after making the yarn finer and the cloth sparser, which is an example. During times of tight market supply, using substandard or defective products to cope with consumers is a capitalist approach. Socialist enterprises should alleviate the tight market supply situation by guaranteeing and improving product quality and extending product service life. Therefore, whether it is departments producing means of production or departments producing consumer goods, they should strive to guarantee and improve product quality, reduce the rate of defective products, and reduce or eliminate waste products when increasing production and practicing economy. All departments and regions should put forward specific requirements for the product quality of their affiliated enterprises, and establish systems to strictly inspect and ensure their realization.
    Then, are heavy, thick, dense, and large products always of good quality? Not necessarily. Some products exceed the necessary weight, thickness, and density, and the service life is not only not extended accordingly, but may even be shortened. For example, some machines use a lot of steel, but they are not as easy to use or durable as those of the same specifications that use less steel. For this type of product, it is necessary to appropriately make them finer, thinner, lighter, and sparser. Not changing them is a waste and does not conform to the requirements of increasing production and practicing economy. However, when modifying product specifications, it must be done after trial production, trial use, or trial sales, soliciting the opinions of the using units or consumers, and with the approval of the relevant leading authorities. Only such modifications can ensure product quality and save raw materials.
    Quality issues involve many aspects and require the support and cooperation of all parties, especially the major efforts of the factory itself, to achieve the desired results. This year, there are unfavorable conditions and favorable conditions for guaranteeing and improving product quality. The unfavorable condition is that the quality of raw materials in some enterprises is not good enough. The favorable conditions are: due to insufficient raw material supply, many enterprises have surplus equipment and labor, and workers and technicians are not rushing to complete production tasks as they did in previous years, and can devote more time and energy to improving product quality. Another favorable condition is that after several years of efforts, especially since the launch of the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement centered on improving product quality last year, a lot of experience in improving product quality has been accumulated. For example, many medium and large factories with relatively strong technical strength have formulated relatively advanced technical operating procedures and inspection systems. Many medium and small factories with relatively weak technical strength are also conducting various technical collaborations under the leadership of leading authorities, transforming necessary equipment, and some are organizing engineering and technical personnel from various factories by industry or specialty, and through comparing output, quality, cost, and operation, concentrating the essence of each factory, formulating product operating procedures or key operating points for major processes, and formulating product quality standards. Some have organized regional technical collaboration, through quality exhibitions, mutual visits and learning, exchanging experiences, and improving together. This year, we should take a step forward on this basis and summarize and promote the experiences that can both save raw materials and guarantee or improve product quality. Those that already have operating procedures, inspection systems, and quality standards but are not perfect enough should be improved this year; those that do not have them should be re-formulated. Handicraft cooperatives should also adopt technical collaboration methods to gradually formulate product operating procedures and quality standards. Even if the procedures and standards formulated are not perfect at the beginning, it is better than having nothing.
    In some factories that implement piece-rate wage systems and bonus systems, some workers simply pursue quantity and neglect quality in order to earn more wages or bonuses. For these workers, the Party organizations, administration, Communist Youth League, and trade unions in the enterprise should, on the one hand, strengthen their education and enable them to correctly combine personal interests with national interests. On the other hand, they can also consider implementing a piece-rate wage method and bonus method based on quality. The so-called "piece-rate based on quality" means that the piece-rate wage and bonus are higher for products of good quality; the wage and bonus are lower for products of inferior quality; and no wage or bonus is given for products that do not meet the quality standards. This can stimulate workers to pay more attention to product quality and work harder to learn technology. This will benefit workers, the country, and consumers.

    赶快扭转产品质量下降的现象
    在1956年的增产节约运动中，许多工业企业既节约了原材料，又保证或提高了产品质量，这是有重大意义的经验和收获。但在目前蓬勃开展的增产节约运动中，有一些企业并没有继续发扬这个经验，因而产品质量下降了。例如今年第一季度，上海的轻工业和纺织工业的一百七十种产品中，质量下降的有四十五种。沈阳市第二工业局所属企业的三十五种主要产品，质量下降的有搪瓷面盆、胶鞋、温度计、有光纸等十多种。保证和提高工业品质量，是关系着国家工业化建设，关系着人民生活的大事情。从产品的使用价值来说，保证和提高质量，延长它的使用时间，就是最大的节约；相反，产品的使用时间缩短了，甚至不能使用，就是最大的浪费。所以，提高产品质量，是任何社会主义企业不可动摇的方针。如果产品质量不好，那末即使节约很多原材料，也是违反增产节约的精神的。
    为什么在轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动中，有些企业的产品质量下降了呢？有人说是今年供应的原料质量不好。因为原料的质量不好而使产品质量达不到去年标准的只是部分企业。许多企业是因为技术工作和管理工作有缺点：原料和产品是好是坏，没有必要的仪器来检验，没有一个标准来衡量，一切都凭眼看、手摸、鼻闻、耳朵听，因而产品质量经常处于忽高忽低的状态。如果做的是老产品，或者原料比较好一些，产品质量也会好一些；如果做的是新产品，或者原料质量改变了，产品质量就会下降。第一季度有些企业的产品质量下降，正是因为原料和品种改变以后，技术工作和管理工作没有相应改进所造成的。毫无疑问，这种状况是应该改变，也是可以改变的。
    在某些企业，特别是轻工业和手工业企业里，流行着一种似是而非的说法，认为在原材料供应不足，产品不能满足需要的情况下，国家和企业首先应该考虑的是产品的“有”“无”问题，即数量问题，而可以不考虑“好”“坏”的问题。在这种借口之下，就发生了单纯追求“稀”、“薄”、“细”、“轻”的偏向。例如，有的棉纺织厂为了多织布，把纱支改细了，但不相应地增加经纱和纬纱，结果织出来的布变稀变薄了，不耐穿了。有的机器厂为了节约钢材，乱改产品设计，结果造出来的机器的使用年限减少了，甚至不能用了。很显然，这种认为产品不能满足需要就只讲产量不注意质量的作法是十分错误的。因为，第一、任何产品，如果不能保证一定的质量，就会给消费者带来损失，给国家造成资源的浪费。第二、生产资料类的产品，是用来建设或生产的。我们建设一个工厂，生产一件产品，就必须保证它适用、耐用、经济，因此就要求有质量合格的设备、工具和原材料。设备、工具、原材料不够，我们宁可削减计划，也不能滥竽充数。消费资料类的产品，是满足人民生活需要的。消费者要求买到价廉物美的东西。价高而物不美（不耐用）的东西，消费者是不欢迎的。特别是那些按定量购买的工业品，如棉布，消费者对产品质量的要求，尤其严格。今年，辽宁有些棉纺织厂把纱支改细，把布织稀以后卖不出去，就是一个例子。在市场供应紧张的时候，用次品、坏品来应付消费者，这是资本主义的办法。社会主义企业应该以保证和提高产品质量，延长产品使用时间的办法来缓和市场的供应紧张情况。因此，不论是生产生产资料部门或生产消费资料部门，它们在增产节约的时候，都应当努力保证和提高产品质量，降低次品率，减少以至消灭废品。各部门和地方应当对所属企业的产品质量提出具体的要求，并且规定制度，严格检查，保证实现。
    那末，是不是重的、稠的、厚的、大的产品都是质量好的呢？也不是。有些产品超过了应有的重量、厚度和密度，使用时间不仅没有相应地延长，反而会缩短。例如有些机器，所用的钢材很多，但并不比那些使用钢材较少的同样规格的机器好用和耐用。对于这一类产品，适当地改细、改薄、改轻、改稀是很必要的，不改就是浪费，就不符合于增产节约的要求。但是，在修改产品规格的时候，必须经过试制、试用或试销，征求使用单位或消费者的意见，经过有关领导机关批准。这样的修改，才能保证产品质量，又能节约原材料。
    质量问题牵涉的方面很多，需要各方面的支持和配合，特别是需要工厂本身的重大努力，才能取得应有的成效。今年保证和提高产品质量，有不利的条件，也有有利的条件。不利的条件就是有些企业的原料质量不够好。有利的条件是：由于原材料供应不足，许多企业的设备和劳动力都有余，工人和技术人员不像往年那样赶产量任务，可以把更多时间和精力用在改进产品质量的工作上面。还有一个有利条件，就是经过几年来的努力，特别是去年开展以提高产品质量为中心的增产节约运动以来，已经积累了不少提高产品质量的经验。例如，许多技术力量比较强的中、大型工厂，都制订了比较先进的技术操作规程、检验制度。许多技术力量比较薄弱的中、小型工厂，也在领导机关的领导下，进行各种技术协作，改造必要的设备，有的按照行业或专业把各厂的工程技术人员组织起来，通过比产量、比质量、比成本、比操作，把各厂的精华集中起来，制订了产品的操作规程或主要工序的操作要点，制订了产品的质量标准。有的则组织地区性的技术协作，通过质量展览会，互相参观和学习，交流心得，共同提高。我们今年应该在这个基础上向前迈进一步，把那些既能节约原材料又能保证或提高产品质量的经验加以总结和推广。已经有了操作规程、检验制度、质量标准，但还不够完善的，今年要使它们完善；还没有的，就要重新制订。手工业合作社也应该采取技术协作的办法，逐步制订产品的操作规程和质量标准。开始的时候，即使制订的规程和标准不够完善，但是，总比没有好。
    在一些实行计件工资制度和超额奖励制度的工厂里，部分工人为了多得工资或奖金，单纯追求数量，忽视质量。对于这些工人，企业里的党组织、行政、青年团和工会，一方面要加强对他们的教育，使他们正确地把个人利益和国家利益结合起来。另一方面，也可以考虑实行一种按质计件的工资办法和奖励办法。所谓“按质计件”，就是产品质量好的，计件工资和奖金就高一些；质量次的，工资和奖金就低一些；质量不合格的，不给工资或奖金。这样可以刺激工人更加关心产品质量，更加努力学习技术。这对于工人、国家、和消费者都会有好处的。
