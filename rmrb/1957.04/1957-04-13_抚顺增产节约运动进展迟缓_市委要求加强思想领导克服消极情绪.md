Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, April 11th: The Fushun Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out at an enlarged meeting held from the 5th to the 8th that the mass production increase and economy drive in Fushun's industrial and mining enterprises has been basically launched. After mass discussions, the city's planned total industrial output value for this year has been increased by more than 34 million yuan compared to the state plan, and the profits to be turned over to the state have been increased by more than 19 million yuan compared to the state plan. In the first quarter of this year, the city overfulfilled its total industrial output value plan, and capital construction units vigorously carried out construction preparation work.

However, the meeting pointed out that, on the whole, the current state of the movement's development is not yet compatible with this year's production and construction tasks, and progress is slow. Leadership is still hesitant in mobilizing the masses to carry out the production increase and economy drive, the enthusiasm of the masses is not universally high, rationalization proposals have decreased significantly compared to last year, and office work is still lagging behind the development of the movement. In terms of plan implementation, the economic quotas for some major products were not completed in the first quarter, and quality also fluctuated; particularly prominent is the monthly increase in the number of accidents in various factories and mines, with the same accidents occurring continuously.

The meeting believes that the existence of these problems is mainly because the leading cadres of enterprises lack sufficient understanding of the special significance of this year's production increase and economy drive and the position of Fushun City, and lack a high sense of responsibility. In addition, they lack a correct understanding of the achievements of last year's industrial upsurge and the favorable factors of this year's movement, and excessively exaggerate the current difficulties. Therefore, the meeting decided that Party committees at all levels must strengthen the ideological leadership of the production increase and economy drive, and carry out extensive and in-depth ideological education work among Party members and the masses of workers and staff, so that all workers and staff can understand Fushun City's position in the production increase and economy drive in light of the current national difficulties, thereby strengthening confidence, overcoming negative sentiments and conservative ideas, and carrying out the movement in a thorough and full manner. Coal, petroleum, steel, cement, electricity and other products urgently needed by the state should actively increase production on the basis of ensuring quality and safety.

The meeting emphasized that if the current state of deteriorating safety is not quickly reversed, it will not only make the production increase and economy drive lose its guarantee, but also greatly harm the political enthusiasm of the masses. Therefore, it was decided that all factories, mines and construction sites should conduct a mass safety inspection from April for a period of one month to one and a half months.

    抚顺增产节约运动进展迟缓
    市委要求加强思想领导克服消极情绪
    新华社抚顺11日电　中共抚顺市委在5日到8日举行的扩大会议上指出，抚顺各工矿企业群众性的增产节约运动，已经基本上发动起来。全市今年工业总产值计划经过群众讨论以后，比国家计划增加三千四百多万元，上缴利润比国家计划增加一千九百多万元。今年第一季度全市超额完成了工业总产值计划，基本建设单位大力进行了施工准备工作。
    但是会议指出，总的看来，运动发展的现状和今年的生产建设任务还不相适应，进展迟缓。领导上在发动群众开展增产节约运动方面还束手束脚，群众的积极性不是普遍高涨，合理化建议比去年大大减少，科室工作还跟不上运动的发展。在执行计划方面，第一季度部分主要产品的经济定额没有完成，质量也有波动；特别突出的是各厂矿事故次数逐月上升，同样的事故连续发生。
    会议认为，这些问题的存在，主要是因为企业领导干部对今年增产节约运动的特殊意义及抚顺市所处的地位认识不足，缺乏高度的责任感，另外对去年工业高潮的成绩和今年运动的有利因素缺乏正确的认识，过分夸大当前的困难。因此会议决定，各级党委必须加强增产节约运动的思想领导，在党员和职工群众中进行广泛深入的思想教育工作，使全体职工结合全国当前的困难认识抚顺市在增产节约运动中的地位，从而坚定信心，克服消极情绪和保守思想，把运动深入饱满地开展下去。煤炭、石油、钢、水泥、电力等国家急需的产品，应该在保证质量和安全的基础上积极提高产量。
    会议强调指出，当前安全情况恶化的状态如不很快扭转，不仅会使增产节约失去保证，同时会大大伤害群众的政治积极性。因此，决定各厂矿和建筑工地，从4月份起以一个月到一个半月的时间进行一次群众性的安全大检查。
