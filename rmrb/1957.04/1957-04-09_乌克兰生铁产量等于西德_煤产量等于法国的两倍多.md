Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 8th: Kirichenko, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine, pointed out in an article that the pig iron production of the Ukrainian Republic is now approximately equal to that of the Federal Republic of Germany, and exceeds that of Great Britain, France, and some other capitalist countries in Europe. Its coal mining volume is 2.3 times that of France.

Kirichenko's article was published in "Pravda" on April 7th. He wrote that in 1956, the total industrial output of the Ukrainian Republic had increased to eighteen times that of 1913 before the October Revolution. Among them, the total output of the machine manufacturing industry and the metal processing industry increased by more than one hundred and thirty times. Last year, the republic produced nearly seventeen times more electricity than the total electricity production of the entire Russia before the revolution.

Before the October Revolution, Ukraine produced more than 78% of the total coal output of Russia. Now, its coal production has increased to six times that of 1913.
