The Shanghai Huaming Battery Factory has recently successfully trial-produced a type of "air battery." Some people have already installed a batch of samples they trial-produced in flashlights for use, and the effect is very good.

This battery uses waste cottonseed hulls, etc., burned into ash at high temperatures to replace manganese powder in the zinc skin of ordinary batteries. Three small holes are made in the outer shell to allow air to interact with the cottonseed hull ash, etc., to produce light. The brightness is slightly lower than ordinary batteries, but the usage time is twice as long as ordinary batteries, and the cost is also 7% lower.

This "air battery" will soon be produced in batches at the Huaming Battery Factory.

    空气电池
    上海华明电池厂最近试制成功一种“空气电池”。有些人已经把他们试制出来的一批样品，装在手电筒里使用，效果很好。
    这种电池是把废弃的棉籽壳等用高温烧成灰，代替锰粉装在普通电池的锌皮里，外壳上凿三个小孔，使空气和棉籽壳灰等发生作用而发光。亮度比一般电池略小，但使用时间比一般电池要长一倍，成本也低7％。
    这种“空气电池”不久就要在华明电池厂成批生产。
