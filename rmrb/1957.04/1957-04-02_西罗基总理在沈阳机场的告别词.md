Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, April 1st. The full text of Premier Široký's farewell speech at Shenyang Airport upon concluding his visit to China:

    Dear comrades, friends:

    After conducting successful talks with the government of the People’s Republic of China and after a fraternal and unified visit to your country, we are about to leave the great land of China.

    We spent nearly three weeks in your midst, and throughout this time, we felt sincere sympathy and thoughtful hospitality everywhere we went. Wherever we went, the residents welcomed us like their own brothers with bouquets of flowers and joyful smiles. In all these moving scenes, we experienced the Chinese people's friendship for the Czechoslovak people, and we saw your appreciation of the Czechoslovak people's modest contributions to the cause of socialist construction and the common struggle for peace.

    During our visit to the People's Republic of China, we had the opportunity to meet with the statesmen and leaders of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Communist Party of China, who are deeply respected by the entire international workers' movement and by all peace-loving people in the world. We also spoke with leaders of some provinces and cities, as well as Chinese workers, farmers, and scientific, cultural, and literary workers. All these sincere and comradely conversations indicated a complete consensus in our viewpoints. These talks enabled us to understand the situation in the People's Republic of China and the tasks that your great country has put forward and is implementing much more deeply than before. The lessons and experiences we have drawn are very valuable, and we will apply them to our own work.

    What has left a deep impression on us is the great and unshakable unity of the Chinese People's Democratic United Front. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people are realizing the general line of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China with this unity, which is to transform the People's Republic of China into a highly industrialized socialist power. All your achievements are not only important for the Chinese people but also have great international significance. Because everything that happens in such a country with the largest population in the world has a huge impact on the future destiny of mankind. Every one of your achievements is strengthening and consolidating the entire socialist camp, and it is benefiting Czechoslovakia, which is situated on the western border of the great socialist world.

    The result of our fruitful talks with your national leaders is the signing of four important documents that express the common will and feelings of our two peoples.

    We have concluded the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between the Czechoslovak Republic and the People's Republic of China, through which we have cemented the fraternal friendship between the peoples of our two countries. This treaty is solid and strong because it embodies the real relationship that exists between the peoples of our two countries.

    We have also issued a joint statement by the two governments, which is not only a contribution to the strengthening of our friendly and cooperative relations but also a contribution to the unity of the socialist camp and to peace among nations. Therefore, it is welcomed by our common friends and arouses the hatred of our common enemies.

    Dear comrades, friends:

    On behalf of our delegation, I would like to express our heartfelt gratitude for your warm reception and for all these countless expressions of brotherly friendship.

    Our friendship is a great achievement of our people and a fruit of the victorious ideas of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism.

    On behalf of all the Czechoslovak people, I sincerely wish you even greater achievements in the cause of further socialist construction and in the struggle for peace in Asia and the world.

    Glory belongs to the People's Republic of China!

    Long live the eternal and unbreakable fraternal friendship between the peoples of the People's Republic of China and the Czechoslovak Republic!

    May the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union grow stronger and stronger.

    Goodbye, comrades!

    西罗基总理在沈阳机场的告别词
    新华社沈阳1日电　西罗基总理结束在中国的访问时在沈阳机场上发表的告别词全文：亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    我们在同中华人民共和国政府进行了顺利的会谈之后，在贵国进行了兄弟之谊的和团结的访问之后，就要离开伟大的中国国土了。
    我们在你们当中度过了将近三个星期的时间，在这全部时间内，我们处处感受到真挚的同情和周到的款待。我们所到之处，居民都用满怀的鲜花和欢欣的微笑像亲兄弟一样地欢迎我们。在这一切动人的情景中，我们体会到中国人民对捷克斯洛伐克人民的友情，我们看到你们对捷克斯洛伐克人民在社会主义建设事业和争取和平的共同斗争中所作的微薄贡献的赞许。
    在访问中华人民共和国期间，我们曾获得机会同深受整个国际工人运动、深受全世界爱好和平人民尊敬的中华人民共和国政府和中国共产党的政治家和领导同志会见，我们也曾同一些省份和城市的领导人、同中国的工人、农民和科学文化工作者、作家谈话。所有这些真诚的同志般的谈话，都表明了我们观点的完全一致。这些谈话使我们比以前深入得多地了解到中华人民共和国的情况，了解到你们伟大的国家所提出的和所执行的任务。我们所吸取的教益和经验是非常宝贵的，我们将把它们运用到自己的工作中去。
    给我们留下深刻印象的，是中国人民民主统一战线的伟大的、不可动摇的团结一致。在中国共产党的领导下，中国人民正以这种团结实现着中国共产党第八次全国代表大会的总路线，这就是把中华人民共和国改变成为一个高度工业化的社会主义大国。你们的一切成就，不仅对中国人民是重要的，而且还具有伟大的国际意义。因为在这样一个世界上按人口计算最大的国家中所发生的一切事情，都对人类今后的命运有着巨大的影响。你们的每一个成就，都在加强着、巩固着整个社会主义阵营，都给处在伟大的社会主义世界西部边境的捷克斯洛伐克带来益处。
    我们同你们国家领导人之间富有成效的会谈结果，就是签定了四项表达我们两国人民共同意志和感情的重要文件。
    我们缔结了捷克斯洛伐克共和国和中华人民共和国之间的友好合作条约，我们通过这一条约将两国人民的兄弟友谊固定下来。这一条约之所以巩固有力，是因为它体现着我们两国的人民之间存在着的真实的关系。
    我们也发表了两国政府的联合声明，这一声明不仅对我们相互间友好合作关系的加强是个贡献，而且对社会主义阵营的团结、对各国间的和平也是一个贡献。因此，它受到我们共同的朋友的欢迎，引起我们共同敌人的仇恨。
    亲爱的同志们，朋友们：
    我代表我们代表团，衷心地感谢你们的热烈接待，感谢你们这一切数不清的兄弟友情的表示。
    我们的友谊是我们人民的伟大成果，是胜利的马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义思想的果实。
    我代表全体捷克斯洛伐克人民诚挚地祝你们在进一步建设社会主义的事业中，在争取亚洲和全世界和平的斗争中获得更多成就。
    光荣属于中华人民共和国！
    中华人民共和国和捷克斯洛伐克共和国人民之间永恒的，牢不可破的兄弟友谊万岁！
    让以苏联为首的社会主义阵营日益强盛和壮大。
    同志们，再见！
