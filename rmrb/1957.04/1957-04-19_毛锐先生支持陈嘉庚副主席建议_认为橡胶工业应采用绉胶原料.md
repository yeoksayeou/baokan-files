    Mr. Mao Rui Supports Vice Chairman Chen Jiageng's Suggestion
    Believes Rubber Industry Should Use Crêpe Rubber Raw Material

    (Our newspaper's report) Regarding the suggestion made by Chen Jiageng, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), at the Third Plenary Session of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC held in March this year, that China's rubber industry should adopt crêpe rubber raw materials (see page 2 of this newspaper on March 15 for details), Mr. Mao Rui of the Hong Kong New World Rubber Products Factory subsequently sent a letter to Chen Jiageng expressing his support. This letter was forwarded to this newspaper by the Secretariat of the National Committee of the CPPCC, and the full text is as follows:

    Having read the report in the March newspaper regarding Vice Chairman Chen Jiageng's suggestion at the CPPCC Plenary Session that China's rubber industry should use crêpe rubber as a raw material, I believe it is extremely beneficial to the country's economic construction and worthy of support.

    Because I have been engaged in the rubber industry for nearly ten years, I have some knowledge of the performance of rubber. Upon investigation, the disadvantages of products made from crêpe rubber are that they are slightly harder than products made from smoked sheet rubber, and the tensile strength is slightly worse. However, as long as sufficient attention is paid during operation and appropriate adjustments are made in the ingredients, these shortcomings can be avoided.

    Moreover, rubber products are not limited to tires; there are countless other products. If there is no need for stretching or friction resistance, crêpe rubber can be used for manufacturing. There is absolutely no problem. Therefore, I hope that this suggestion will be supported and that rubber factories will be urged to use both crêpe rubber in production in order to save the country's foreign exchange.

    Mao Rui bows in respect, from Hong Kong.

    毛锐先生支持陈嘉庚副主席建议
    认为橡胶工业应采用绉胶原料
    本报讯　政协全国委员会副主席陈嘉庚在今年3月份召开的政协第二届全国委员会第三次全体会议上提出我国橡胶工业应采用绉料原料的建议（详见3月15日本报二版），以后香港新世界橡胶制品厂毛锐先生给陈嘉庚来函表示支持。此函由全国政协秘书处转本报，全文如下：
    阅今年3月报载陈嘉庚副主席在政协全体会议上对我国橡胶工业应采用绉胶原料的建议。对国家经济建设极为有利。值得拥护。
    因为本人从事橡胶工业，几将十年，略知橡胶性能。查绉胶制成品之缺点：较烟片胶制成品略硬，拉力强度稍差，但只要操作时加以充分注意，配料方面加以适当调剂，这种缺点是可以避免的。
    而且橡胶制品，并非仅仅车胎一种，其他制品，不胜枚举，若无拉长磨擦等作用者，尽可利用绉胶制造。绝无问题。故希望支持这项建议，督促橡胶工业工厂兼用绉胶制作，以节省国家外汇。　毛锐鞠躬香港来信
