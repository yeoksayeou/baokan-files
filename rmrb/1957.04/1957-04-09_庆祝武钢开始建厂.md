    The construction of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise has officially commenced. This is a great joy for the people of Wuhan and the Central South region, following the start of the Yangtze River Bridge project, and also another great joy for our people nationwide.

    Our people have been using the ore from the Daye Iron Mine to smelt iron for a traditionally believed to be one thousand six or seven hundred years; modern methods of iron smelting in the Wuhan area, from Zhang Zhidong's Hanyang Ironworks, also have a history of more than sixty years. However, before the national liberation, under the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, it was impossible for the steel industry here to develop into a large-scale joint enterprise. The collapse of the former "Hanyeping Company" is an example. In the past, the highest annual steel output here did not exceed 90,000 tons; and a large amount of ore was plundered by imperialism. It was not until after the national liberation that the people's own government investigated the resources and began to prepare for the establishment of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Industrial Base. After several years of effort, the construction of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Works has now officially started.

    The newly built Wuhan Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise, following the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, will be the second large-scale iron and steel joint enterprise in our country. The construction of this joint enterprise is one of the key projects aided by the Soviet Union in our country's construction. It is designed according to the latest technological achievements in the Soviet metallurgical industry. The first phase of its construction is scheduled to be completed by 1961. The first blast furnace will be completed and put into production by the end of next year. After the first phase of this joint enterprise is put into full production, it will increase our country's total steel production by more than one-third on the existing base. It will not only meet the needs of various steel products in Wuhan and the Central South region to a certain extent, but also supply some steel products for use in Shanghai and the East China region.

    At present, our country's industrial construction funds are limited. According to the needs of national economic development, we must build more iron and steel enterprises, various machine manufacturing industries, various chemical industries, various light industries, and also greatly develop transportation and make agriculture mechanized. All of these require a lot of funds. Under such circumstances, it is not easy for the state to invest a considerable amount of funds in the construction of such a large-scale steel base. This requires all comrades participating in this project to truly adhere to the policy of "building the country diligently and thriftily" and "running enterprises diligently and thriftily," strictly save construction costs, and make the greatest efforts to reduce various construction costs. On the premise of strictly ensuring the quality of the project, save all possible raw materials. We must maximize the effectiveness of every bit of material and financial resources. Judging from the past preparatory work of this project, as long as we conscientiously implement the policy of "running enterprises diligently and thriftily," it is possible to save 15%-20% of the construction funds of Wuhan Iron and Steel. Especially in the design work, in the past, only preliminary modifications were made to the original design, and 3 million yuan was saved. If we further study it carefully, practically consider our country's current actual situation, and carefully revise the original design, we will definitely be able to save more funds.

    Due to the backwardness of our country's iron and steel industry, there has been a shortage of various steel products in recent years; if this project can be put into production earlier, it will be a huge boost to the country's industrial production and capital construction. All comrades participating in the construction of this project should seize all construction opportunities, accelerate the progress of the project, and make the greatest efforts to complete it on schedule or ahead of schedule according to the national plan, and ensure that the project quality fully meets the requirements.

    A large-scale project like Wuhan Iron and Steel requires a lot of equipment, materials, power, fuel, and transportation tools. Nearly half of its equipment will be manufactured domestically by ourselves. In order for this steel base to be built smoothly, it requires strong support from relevant departments and the old industrial bases throughout the country. It is hoped that Wuhan City and Hubei Province will make extra efforts to provide support for the supply of certain building materials needed by the Wuhan Iron and Steel Works construction site and the daily necessities for the tens of thousands of workers on this construction site.

### 庆祝武钢开始建厂

    庆祝武钢开始建厂
    武汉钢铁联合企业的建厂工程正式开工了。这是武汉和中南地区的人们继长江大桥工程开工之后的一件大喜事，也是我们全国人民的又一件大喜事。
    我国人民利用大冶铁矿的矿石炼铁，相传已有一千六七百年的历史；采用近代化的方法在武汉地区炼铁，从张之洞的汉阳铁政局算起，也有六十多年的历史了。可是，在全国解放以前，在帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本的统治下，这里的钢铁工业是没有可能发展成一个大规模的联合企业的。从前的“汉冶萍有限公司”的垮台就是一个例证。过去这里钢材的年产量最高也没有超过九万吨；而大量的矿石，则是被帝国主义掠夺了去。直到全国解放以后，人民自己的政府才去查清了资源，着手准备建立武汉钢铁工业基地。经过这几年的努力，武钢的建厂工程现在才算是正式开工了。
    新建的武汉钢铁联合企业，继鞍山钢铁公司之后，将是我国第二个规模巨大的钢铁联合企业。这个联合企业的建厂工程，是苏联帮助我国建设的重点工程之一。它是按照苏联冶金工业中最新的技术成就进行设计的。它的第一期建厂工程，预定到1961年完成。明年年底将有第一座高炉建成，并且投入生产。这个联合企业的第一期工程全部投入生产以后，将使我国钢铁生产总量在现有基础上增加三分之一以上。它不仅将在一定程度上满足武汉和中南地区各种钢材的需要，还可以有一部分钢材供应上海和华东地区使用。
    目前我国工业建设的资金有限，按照国民经济发展的需要，我们还要建设更多的钢铁企业，还要建设各种机器制造工业、各种化学工业、各种轻工业，还要大量发展交通运输业，还要使农业机械化。这些都是需要大量资金的。在这种情况下，国家能够投放一笔数量相当大的资金，来从事这样大规模的钢铁基地的建设，是不容易的。这就要求所有参加这项工程建设的同志们，真正本着“勤俭建国”“勤俭办企业”的方针，严格地节约建设费用，尽最大的努力降低各种建筑造价。在严格保证工程质量的前提下，节约一切可能节约的原材料。要使每一分物力财力都发挥它最大的效果。从这个工程过去一段的准备工作看来，只要认真贯彻“勤俭办企业”的方针，要节约武钢的建设资金15％—20％是有可能的。特别是在设计工作中，过去仅仅对原设计进行了初步修改，就节约了三百万元资金，如果再进一步认真地研究，切实地考虑我国目前的实际情况，慎重地对原设计再加以修改，就一定能够更多地节约一些资金。
    由于我国钢铁工业基础落后，近年来各种钢材都感到不足；如果这个工程能够早些投入生产，对于全国的工业生产和基本建设都将是一个巨大的鼓舞。参加这一工程建设的全体同志们，应该抓紧一切施工机会，加速工程进度，尽最大的努力，使它按照国家计划如期完成或提前完成，并且保证工程质量完全合乎要求。
    像武钢这样一个规模巨大的工程所需要的设备、材料、动力、燃料和运输工具是很多的。它的设备将近一半要由我们国内自己制造。要使这个钢铁基地顺利地建设起来，就需要各有关部门和全国各个老的工业基地给以有力的支援。武钢工地所需要的若干建筑材料和这个工地上数万职工的生活必需品的供应，希望武汉市和湖北省格外尽力地给以支援。
