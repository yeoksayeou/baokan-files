    The Great Spirit of Proletarian Internationalism
    The Soviet Union Provides Extensive Aid to European Brotherly Countries
    Loans Exceeding Two Billion Rubles Agreed Upon in Half a Year
    Xinhua News Agency, April 19th: On April 17th, the talks between the Soviet Union and Albania concluded. As of this point, all European People's Democratic countries have held talks with the Soviet Union in recent months. In these talks, the Soviet Union once again demonstrated the great spirit of proletarian internationalism, providing a large amount of economic assistance to brotherly countries, further strengthening economic cooperation between them.
    Since last November, the Soviet Union has agreed to lend more than two billion rubles to the European People's Democratic countries, and has cancelled huge debts owed to the Soviet Union by some brotherly countries. In addition, the Soviet Union also supplied some brotherly countries with large amounts of grain on credit.
    In order to help the Hungarian people overcome economic difficulties, the Soviet Union provided particularly large economic assistance during the recent Soviet-Hungarian talks. This year, the Soviet Union lent Hungary a total of 875 million rubles, and is also prepared to supply Hungary with 1.001 billion rubles worth of goods. In addition, the Soviet Union also cancelled Hungary's debt to the Soviet Union of more than 1 billion forints, and agreed to postpone Hungary's repayment of a 150 million ruble loan.
    The Soviet Union's assistance to Poland is also very significant. The Soviet government agreed to lend Poland 700 million rubles, and will supply Poland with 1.4 million tons of grain on credit this year. The Soviet and Polish sides also agreed that the Soviet loans already used by Poland before November 1, 1956 (totaling more than 2 billion rubles) do not need to be repaid and can be used to offset Poland's coal prices.
    The Soviet Union has also provided significant assistance to other brotherly countries in solving problems encountered in the further development of their national economies. In February of this year, the Soviet Union twice provided loans to Bulgaria, totaling 570 million rubles. These loans are mainly used to help Bulgaria build factories and purchase agricultural machinery. The German Democratic Republic received a loan of 340 million rubles from the Soviet Union this year to purchase items needed by its national economy, such as coke, oil, and steel. In view of Romania's poor grain harvest last year, the Soviet Union agreed to supply Romania with 450,000 tons of wheat on credit in the first half of this year. The Soviet Union is prepared to supply Czechoslovakia with an additional 250,000 tons of grain, 9,500 tons of lead, and more iron ore this year. The Soviet Union has cancelled Albania's debt to the Soviet Union of 422.2 million rubles, and in order to help Albania realize measures to develop agriculture and industry, it is prepared to provide it with the necessary technical assistance.
    The Soviet Union has also further strengthened cooperation with the European People's Democratic countries in science and technology. The Soviet Union will help Czechoslovakia and Hungary build nuclear power plants and provide the necessary equipment.

    伟大的无产阶级国际主义精神
    苏联大量援助欧洲兄弟国家
    半年来同意给予的贷款超过二十亿卢布
    据新华社19日讯　4月17日，苏联和阿尔巴尼亚的会谈结束。至此，欧洲所有人民民主国家都在最近几个月内先后同苏联举行了会谈。苏联在这些会谈中再一次表现了伟大的无产阶级国际主义精神，向各兄弟国家提供了大量的经济帮助，进一步加强了彼此间的经济合作。
    自从去年11月到目前为止，苏联同意贷给欧洲人民民主国家的款项超过了二十亿卢布，取消了某些兄弟国家欠苏联的巨额债务。此外，苏联还以赊卖方式供给某些兄弟国家以大量粮食。
    苏联为了帮助匈牙利人民克服经济上的困难，在最近举行的苏匈会谈中提供了特别巨大的经济援助。今年苏联借给匈牙利的贷款共达到八亿七千五百万卢布，另外还准备供应匈牙利十亿零一千万卢布的商品。此外，苏联还取消了匈牙利欠苏联的十亿福林以上的债务，并且答应匈牙利缓期偿还一亿五千万卢布的贷款。
    苏联给予波兰的援助也很巨大。苏联政府同意贷给波兰七亿卢布的贷款，并且将以赊卖方式在今年供给波兰一百四十万吨谷物。苏波双方并且同意，1956年11月1日以前波兰已经动用了的苏联贷款（总额在二十亿卢布以上）可以不必偿还，用来补付波兰煤价。
    苏联对其他兄弟国家解决国民经济进一步发展所遇到的问题也提供了重大帮助。今年2月间，苏联两次向保加利亚提供贷款，总数共达五亿七千万卢布，这些贷款主要是用来帮助保加利亚建设工厂和购买农业机器，德意志民主共和国在今年从苏联得到三亿四千万卢布的贷款，用来购买它的国民经济所需要的东西，例如焦炭、石油和钢材等。鉴于罗马尼亚去年粮食歉收，苏联同意在今年上半年以赊卖方式供给罗马尼亚四十五万吨小麦。苏联准备在今年额外供给捷克斯洛伐克二十五万吨谷物，九千五百吨铅和供应更多的铁矿砂。苏联取消了阿尔巴尼亚欠苏联的四亿二千二百万卢布的债务，并且为了帮助阿尔巴尼亚实现发展农业和工业的措施，准备给它以必要的技术援助。
    苏联还进一步加强了同欧洲各人民民主国家在科学技术方面的合作。苏联将帮助捷克斯洛伐克和匈牙利建设原子能发电站并提供必要设备。
