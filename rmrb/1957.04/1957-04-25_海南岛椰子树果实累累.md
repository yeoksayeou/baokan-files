Hainan Island Coconut Trees are Laden with Fruit

    (Our dispatch) The coconut trees in Hainan Island are already laden with coconuts. In the southern regions of Ya County and Lingshui, where coconut groves are relatively dense, each tree bears an average of forty to fifty coconut fruits, about the size of volleyballs. In the famous production areas of Tengqiao, Liudao, and Longhai, the newly planted and growing coconut trees are so easily accessible that people can pick coconuts by simply standing under the trees and reaching out.

    海南岛椰子树果实累累
    本报讯　海南岛各地的椰子树上，已经结满了累累的椰果。椰林比较茂密的南部地区的崖县、陵水一带，平均每棵结有四、五十只左右像排球一样大的椰果；著名产区——藤桥、六道、龙海等地新栽成长的椰树，只要人们站在树头下，伸手便可摘到椰子。　（延昭）
