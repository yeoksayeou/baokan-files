    Yunnan Dyeing and Weaving Factory Marches Towards the Advanced Ranks
    By Our Correspondent Qin Junguang
    Not long ago, in the Third Office of the Yunnan Provincial People's Committee, someone held up several pieces of colored cloth and asked everyone to guess where they were produced. The responsible comrade there confidently said that the beautiful colored cloth came from Shanghai, and the color was inferior were products from the Yunnan Dyeing and Weaving Factory. The truth was quite the opposite. The bright colored fine flannel khaki was a product of the Yunnan Dyeing and Weaving Factory, while the slightly inferior cloth was from Shanghai. This is not to say that all cloth from Shanghai is bad, but to say that the colored cloth produced by the Yunnan Dyeing and Weaving Factory has reached a fairly high level and is welcomed by the masses. Many rural girls travel from far, far away to Kunming to buy "Dianchi" brand fine flannel in colors like phthalein blue, fruit green, and light indigo.
    It should be said that the Yunnan Dyeing and Weaving Factory being able to dye such brightly colored cloth is something worth talking about.
    In the past, many people in Yunnan didn't believe that Yunnan could dye such good colored cloth. Many people always looked at colored cloth from Shanghai and other places. People jokingly said that Yunnan colored cloth was "red cloth not red," "blue cloth not blue," "black cloth not black." Because the dyeing of these cloths was poor, many people were unwilling to buy them. Some workers in the Yunnan Dyeing and Weaving Factory also felt it was a disgrace that their factory's products were poor, and often took off the dyeing factory's badge when going out on the street. When the factory's leaders went to meetings in Kunming, they lowered their heads and hid to one side, not wanting to be seen.
    In the second half of last year, they overfulfilled the state's targets in terms of quality and cost for the 220,000 bolts of colored cloth they produced, and also trial-produced more than 20 kinds of new products that were popular with the masses. In January and February of this year, they trial-produced five new products. Now the quality indicators of the entire factory are rising month by month, from an original qualification rate of about 60% to over 95%. This year, the production task of the Yunnan Dyeing and Weaving Factory is 280,000 bolts of colored cloth. While comprehensively completing the production plan, they also want to trial-produce ten new products.
    Why was the Yunnan Dyeing and Weaving Factory long known as a backward factory, and now it has become an advanced factory? In the past, the leading cadres here, in order to produce fewer substandard cloths, would run around the factory day and night. However, they did not rely on the masses of workers, but instead worked hard themselves. For example, when discussing work, it was not a discussion for everyone, but the factory director spoke and everyone listened. The factory director issued orders, and the shift leader went back to convey them. The shift leader and workshop director were criticized by the factory director, and they would criticize the workers when they returned to the workshop. Once, when discussing a singeing accident, a workshop director suggested whether to lower the temperature and try replacing the copper plate, but not only was it not adopted, but he was also criticized by the factory director. In the end, the factory director still issued an order to raise the temperature of the singeing machine to 900-1000 degrees Fahrenheit. At that time, the workers called the scheduling meeting a "command meeting" and a "meeting for being criticized." At the time when accidents were most frequent, the deputy factory directors, the chairman of the trade union, the workshop directors, and the shift leaders took turns supervising the workers' operations day and night in the dyeing workshop. The workers in the dyeing workshop said that even if the operation was without error, the cadres would find all kinds of reasons to criticize them. As a result of such criticism, as the old worker Liu Chengquan said, the workers were criticized into a daze, how could they have the mind to find tricks!
    The Party work in the Yunnan Dyeing and Weaving Factory was also very weak in the past. Sometimes, when discussing production, disagreements often arose, and sometimes when the two sides could not agree, the Party committee secretary would use the method of shifting the target, telling a passage of Peking opera or a story from "Dream of the Red Chamber" to end the argument.
    In March 1956, the provincial leading organs and the People's Daily successively criticized their quality accidents, and the provincial Party committee sent an inspection team to help them find ways to overcome backwardness.
    Factory director Huang Yuhe also felt wronged when he was first criticized. He said he couldn't understand why a person who was enthusiastic about his work was instead said to be bureaucratic and not going deep among the masses. After the patient persuasion of his comrades, Comrade Huang Yuhe gradually realized that the key to running a good enterprise was to rely on the masses and give play to their enthusiasm. The enthusiasm of a single person was not enough. He bravely accepted the criticism and expressed to all the workers that he would be with everyone and work hard to change the backward situation. Since then, Huang Yuhe went deep into the workshops and into the groups, working with workers and technicians to study the causes of various quality accidents, and sometimes he also took the initiative to visit some of the more backward workers and solicit their opinions. From then on, when the factory director went to the workshop, the workers could take the initiative to greet him and talk to him about the situation. Under the influence of the factory director, the work style of the workshop directors, shift leaders, and section cadres also changed. The relationship between the workers and the cadres became much closer, the workers actively reflected their opinions to the cadres, and the engineering and technical personnel were also willing to approach the factory director and the cadres.
    After the leading cadres of the Party general branch were appropriately adjusted, they reversed the situation of not caring about production.
    In the first half of last year, in order to reverse the situation of poor product quality, the Party committee launched an advanced producer movement centered on the implementation of eleven production technical measures, mobilizing all the workers in the factory to come up with ideas and find solutions. When factory director and Party committee secretary went to the city, they also paid attention to buying small pieces of colored cloth produced in various places, bringing them back to the factory to study with the workers and learn from the experience of brother dyeing factories in other places. Once, factory director Huang Yuhe went to the Cultural Palace to listen to a report. Before the meeting, he classified and counted the colors of the clothes worn by the more than 2,000 people present. From the statistics, he studied the preferences of the masses. In order to enable the factory to quickly catch up with the products of advanced factories, the workers' enthusiasm was brought into play. Last year alone, the workers put forward 199 rationalization proposals, and 104 of them have been adopted. Quality accidents that could not be solved for two years were quickly resolved. In the past, the accidents caused by the singeing machine workshop, such as incomplete singeing, singeing streaks, and scorched edges, were very troublesome. Last year, the workers proposed and conducted temperature reduction experiments. The results of the experiment were very good.
    In order to further eliminate quality accidents, they established a system of intermediate inspection stations and intermediate quality inspection cards, and mutual supervision was implemented among the masses. Since then, the labor enthusiasm of all the workers in the factory has been even higher. On March 8, the production results for the day were announced on the wall of the dyeing workshop:
    The Min Huantao and Diao Yunliang group accumulated 560 bolts inspected. The results of the inspection: 99.89% first-class products, 0.08% second-class products, 0.03% third-class products, no substandard products; humidity and color fastness all qualified; no safety accidents occurred, and full attendance rate. Another list of honor wrote that there were a total of five production groups in the dyeing workshop, with a total of 47 workers. When selecting advanced producers in the fourth quarter of last year, 14 advanced figures emerged. However, a year ago, this workshop was once the workshop with the most quality accidents.

    云南漂染厂走向先进的行列
    本报记者　秦军光
    不久以前，在云南省人民委员会第三办公室里，曾有人拿着几种色布，叫大家猜测是哪里的出品，这里的负责同志肯定的说那种漂亮的色布是从上海来的，颜色比较差的是云南漂染厂里出的。事实恰恰相反，那种颜色鲜明的凡拉明卡叽布，是云南漂染厂的产品，而比较起来稍差一些的色布是上海来的。这并不是说上海的布都不好，而是说云南漂染厂所出产的色布，已经达到了相当高的水平，并且受到广大群众的欢迎。很多农村姑娘跑很远很远来昆明买滇池牌的凡拉明、果绿、浅士林等色布。
    云南漂染厂能够染出这样颜色鲜艳的色布应当说是一件值得谈说的事情。
    过去，很多云南人也不相信云南能够染出那样好的色布，很多人的眼睛总是望着上海和其它地方来的色布。人们幽默地说云南色布是：“红布不红”、“蓝布不蓝”、“黑布不黑”。因为这些布染色差很多人都不愿买。云南漂染厂有些工人也感到本厂产品差不光采，上街时常把漂染厂的符号摘下来。厂里的领导人员去昆明开会的时候，低着头躲在一边不愿见人。
    去年下半年，他们生产的二十二万匹色布，在质量、成本等方面都超额完成了国家指标，并试制了二十多种受群众欢迎的新产品出厂。今年1、2月份又试制成五种新产品。现在全厂的质量指标逐月上升，由原来的60％左右的合格率，提高到95％以上。今年云南漂染厂的生产任务是二十八万匹色布，他们要在全面完成生产计划的同时，再试制十种新产品。
    云南漂染厂过去为什么长期被人称为落后厂，而现在竟变成了先进的工厂呢？过去，这里的领导干部为了少出次布，曾日日夜夜地在厂里跑来跑去。可是，他没有依靠职工群众，而是自己辛辛苦苦的干。例如在讨论工作时不是大家讨论，而是厂长说大家听，厂长下命令，值班长回去传达。值班长、车间主任挨了厂长的批评，回到车间对工人也是批评。有一次在讨论烧毛事故时，一个车间主任提出是否把温度降低，再换个铜板作点试验，结果不仅未予采纳，而且还受到了厂长的批评。最后，厂长还是下命令把烧毛机的温度提高到华氏900—1000度。当时工人们把调度会说成是“命令会”、“挨批评的会”。在事故最多的时候，正副厂长、工会主席、车间主任、值班长等人，在染色车间日夜轮流督班，监督工人操作。染色车间的工人说，操作即便没有错误，也会被干部想出种种原因批评一番。这样批评的结果，正如老工人刘成全说的，工人们被批评得昏头昏脑的，那还有心思找窍门啦！
    云南漂染厂党的工作过去也很薄弱，有时在讨论生产的时候，常常发生不欢而散的情况，有时双方争执不下，党委书记就用转移目标的办法，说段京戏或说段红楼梦的故事来结束争论。
    1956年3月间，省级领导机关和人民日报，曾先后批评了他们的质量事故，省委又派出了检查组，帮助他们寻求克服落后的办法。
    厂长黄煜和在最初受到批评时，也感到委曲，他说他想不通为什么一个热心工作的人，反而说是官僚主义不深入群众。经过同志们的耐心劝导，黄煜和同志逐步认识到办好企业的关键是依靠群众，发挥群众的积极性，单凭某个人的热情是不行的。他勇敢的接受了批评。并向全厂职工表示要同大家在一起，努力改变落后状况。此后，黄煜和深入车间、深入小组，同工人、技术人员在一起，研究造成各种质量事故的原因，有时也主动的访问一些比较落后的工人，征求他们的意见，从此，当厂长下车间的时候，工人们都能主动地迎上来同他谈情况。在厂长的影响下，车间主任、值班长和科室的干部作风也转变了，工人同干部的关系密切多了，工人有意见也主动的向干部反映了，工程技术人员也愿意接近厂长和干部了。
    党总支的领导干部作了适当调整后，扭转了不管生产的状况。
    去年上半年，党委会为了扭转产品质量低劣的状况，曾开展了以贯彻十一项生产技术措施为中心的先进生产者运动，发动了全厂职工出主意、想办法。厂长、党委书记进城时也注意购买各地生产的小块色布，带回工厂同职工们在一起研究，学习外地兄弟染厂的经验。一次厂长黄煜和到文化宫听报告，会前他把在场的二千多人穿的衣服颜色分类作了统计。从统计中来研究群众的爱好。工人们为使工厂迅速赶上先进厂的产品，积极性发挥了，去年一年，职工们提的合理化建议有一百九十九件，已经采纳的就有一百零四件。两年来不能解决的质量事故，很快的就解决了。过去，烧毛机车间造成的烧毛不光、烧毛条花、烧焦边等事故是很伤脑筋的，去年工人们提议、进行降温试验，试验的结果，情况甚好。
    为了进一步杜绝质量事故，他们订出了中间检验站和中间质量检验小卡的制度，群众之间实行互相监督。从此，全厂职工的劳动热情更高了。3月8日在染色车间的墙上公布了这一天的生产成绩：
    闵焕桃、刁云良小组累积检布数五百六十匹检验的结果：一等品99.89％，二等品0.08％，三等品0.03％，等外品没有；干湿度、耐退色全部合格；没发生安全事故，出勤率满员。另外一份光荣榜上写着，染色车间共五个生产小组，职工共四十七人，去年第四季度评选先进生产者的时候，涌现出先进人物十四人，可是，在一年以前，这个车间曾经是质量事故最多的车间。
