    "Educational Opportunity"
    Japanese public opinion is increasingly opposed to the continued American occupation of Japan. The United States is determined to give the Japanese press some "education."
    According to Agence France-Presse, a delegation of Japanese journalists invited by the U.S. government to visit the United States is scheduled to depart from Tokyo today. The delegation consists of twenty-nine editors from Japanese magazines, newspapers, radio stations, and television news outlets. They will be the "honored guests" of General Carter, commander of the U.S. Far East Air Force, and the United States Information Service. The main purpose of the delegation's trip is to visit the U.S. Air Force base in Eglin, Florida, to witness a demonstration of U.S. air power. According to Carter, this visit is an "educational opportunity for Japanese journalists."
    Leaving aside Carter's tone, which treats the Japanese as an inferior race, it is clear what kind of "education" the United States wants to give Japanese journalists. It is to show the Japanese journalists the so-called "deterrent" power of the U.S. Air Force. After receiving this "education," these Japanese journalists may then promote to the Japanese people the importance of the U.S. Air Force in "protecting" Japan, and present arguments against demanding the withdrawal of U.S. bases in Japan.
    However, frankly speaking, this kind of "education" is superfluous. Haven't the Japanese people been "educated" enough by the United States? Japan was the first country in the world to taste the atomic bomb. Japanese crew member Aikichi Kuboyama and others lost their lives due to U.S. hydrogen bomb tests at Bikini Atoll. Because of the construction of U.S. military bases, many hardworking Japanese people have been forced to leave the land passed down by their ancestors. American planes fill the sky, and atomic cannons roar in front of Mount Fuji. Even the American "Red Dragonfly" (the Japanese name for unmanned aircraft) is as familiar to the Japanese as real dragonflies. The result of this "education" is that the Japanese people have shouted the slogans "We want peace, not war" and "Yankees go home!"
    Whether this group of Japanese journalists invited to the United States for "education" will be "influenced" by this "education" remains to be seen. Even if they are indeed "influenced," what impact can twenty-nine people have on ninety million Japanese people?

### “教育机会”

    “教育机会”
    日本舆论界反对美国继续占领日本的论调越来越多了。美国决心要给日本报界来一番“教育”。
    据法新社报道，应美国政府邀请去美国访问的一个日本记者代表团，定于今天从东京起身赴美。代表团由二十九位日本杂志、报纸、电台和电视新闻的编辑组成，他们将是美国远东空军司令卡特和美国新闻处的“上宾”。代表团此行，主要是在美国佛罗里达州伊尔坚空军基地参观美国空军火力的表演。据卡特说，这次访问是“对日本记者的教育机会”。
    撇开卡特这种把日本人看成劣等民族的口气不谈，美国要给日本记者受什么“教育”，是很清楚的了。这就是要向日本记者们显示美国空军的所谓“威慑”力量。而在受了这番“教育”以后，这些日本记者也许会向日本人民宣传美国空军对于“保护”日本的重要性，提出一些不应该要求撤销美国在日本的基地的论据。
    可是，说实在话，这种“教育”是多余的。日本人民给美国“教育”得还不够吗？在世界上，第一个尝到原子弹滋味的是日本。美国在比基尼岛试验氢弹，日本船员元保山爱吉等丧了命。由于修建美国军事基地，多少勤劳的日本人被迫离开了祖辈传下来的土地。美国飞机满天飞，原子大炮在富士山前轰鸣。就是美国的“赤蜻蜓”（日本人对无人操纵的飞机的称呼），在日本眼里也真像蜻蜓一样是看惯了的。这种“教育”的结果是：日本人民喊出了“要和平，不要战争”、“美国佬滚回去”的口号。
    被美国邀请到美国去受“教育”的这批日本记者，是否会被这种“教育”所“感化”，还是一个问题。就算他们居然被“感化”了，二十九个人对于九千万日本人民来说，又能有什么作用呢？
