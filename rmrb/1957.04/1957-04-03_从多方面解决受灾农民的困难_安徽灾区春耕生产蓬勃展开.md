    Solving Difficulties for Disaster-Stricken Farmers from Multiple Aspects
    Spring Ploughing Production in Anhui Disaster Areas Unfolds Vigorously
    Xinhua News Agency, Hefei Dispatch Anhui Province is solving the difficulties of disaster-stricken farmers from multiple aspects, and spring ploughing production in the disaster areas has now unfolded vigorously.
    This province suffered severe waterlogging and typhoons and other natural disasters last year. Disaster-stricken farmers are facing difficulties because of a lack of food and fuel, a lack of feed for draught animals, many damaged farm tools, and insufficient fertilizer, and spring ploughing production progressed slowly in the previous period. In order to solve these difficulties, the state has given disaster-stricken farmers great support. From January to March this year, more than 23 million yuan in relief funds have been distributed in the disaster areas, and recently, more than 12 million yuan in sideline production, animal protection, and living loans, and more than 20 million yuan in advance purchase deposits for crops have been successively distributed, as well as 70,000 tons of coal for relief (not including commodity supply coal). At the same time, Party and government organs in the disaster areas actively led the peasants to carry out various sideline productions and conduct production for self-salvation, and have also made a profit of 5.41 million yuan in January and February. In order to solve the difficulty of the lack of feed for draught animals in the disaster areas and restore the physical strength of the draught animals, on the one hand, the disaster victims were mobilized to dig grass roots locally, and more than 10 million jin of cottonseed cake, sesame cake, and bean cake were transferred to the disaster areas from all parts of the province, and on the other hand, people were sent to other places to purchase forage.
    The Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative also supplied a large amount of production materials to the disaster areas earlier this year. So far, in the Huaibei area alone, 120,000 dan of chemical fertilizers, more than 46,000 dan of various pesticides, more than 33,000 sets of various sprayers and machines, and more than 33,000 pieces of various new-style farm implements have been supplied. The supply of these production materials has exceeded the supply in the same period of any year since liberation.
    Due to the solution of various difficulties in the disaster areas, the progress of spring ploughing production in the disaster areas has accelerated. At present, the attendance rate of many agricultural cooperatives has reached more than 90%. More than 80% of the spring land in Fuyang and Bengbu Special Zones has been plowed once. Some areas have begun to sow spring corn and sorghum. Field management of wheat fields is also underway. More than 4 million mu of wheat in the Fuyang Special Zone have been top-dressed.

    从多方面解决受灾农民的困难
    安徽灾区春耕生产蓬勃展开
    新华社合肥电　安徽省从多方面解决受灾农民的困难，灾区春耕生产现已蓬勃展开。
    这个省去年遭受了严重的内涝和台风等自然灾害。灾区农民由于缺少口粮、燃料，耕畜缺乏饲料，农具毁坏很多，肥料也不足，前一时期春耕生产进展迟缓。为了解决这些困难，国家给了灾区农民极大支援。从今年1月到3月，已在灾区发放救济款二千三百多万元，最近又陆续发放副业、保畜、生活等贷款一千二百多万元，农作物预购定金二千多万元，救济的煤炭七万吨（商品供应煤尚不在内）。同时，灾区党政机关又积极领导农民开展各种副业生产，进行生产自救，在1、2两个月中也已获利五百四十一万元。为了解决灾区耕畜缺乏饲料的困难，恢复耕畜的体力，一方面发动灾民在本地挖草根，并从省内各地调往灾区棉籽饼、芝麻饼和豆饼一千多万斤，一方面又派人到外地收购饲草。
    省供销合作社今年也提早供应了灾区大量的生产资料。到目前为止，仅淮北地区已供应化学肥料十二万担，各种农药四万六千多担，各种药械三万三千多架，各种新式农具三万三千多件。这些生产资料的供应量都超过了解放后任何一年同期的供应量。
    由于解决了灾区各种困难，灾区春耕生产进度已经转快，目前，很多农业社的出勤率都达到90％以上。阜阳和蚌埠专区已有80％以上的春地耕过一遍。有些地区已开始播种春玉米和高粱。小麦地的田间管理也正在紧张进行。阜阳专区已有四百多万亩小麦施了追肥。
