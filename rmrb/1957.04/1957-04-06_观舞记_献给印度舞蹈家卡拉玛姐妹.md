    Record of Watching Dance
    ——Dedicated to Indian Dancers, the Karama Sisters
    Bing Xin
    How should I describe the dance of the Indian Karama sisters?
    If I were a poet, I would write a long poem to depict their ever-changing and graceful swirling dance.
    If I were a painter, I would use various colors to paint their clear and elegant eyebrows and their gorgeous costumes.
    If I were a composer, I would use musical notes to convey their light and nimble dance steps and the soft ringing of their bells.
    If I were a sculptor, I would simulate their vibrant, slender, and agile figures on plaster.
    But I am none of these! I can only use my own poor words to describe this amazing art of dance.
    Like a baby who sees a dazzling red lotus in the morning sun, a peacock swirling in the deep forest, he wants to shout out the joy in his heart, but apart from babbling, he can't find the right language!
    But, friend, can I bear to hold back the joy and excitement in my heart and not utter my "babbling" to you?
    I dare not pretend to be a scholar of Indian dance to expound on the history and schools of Indian dance, to explain that the Bharatanatyam dance they perform is the orthodox school of Indian dance. I also dare not, like a dancer, expertly praise how accurate and "outstanding" their every gesture and foot movement is.
    I am just an admirer, but I am willing to try my best to express the flying "beauty" I feel in my heart!
    Friend, on an unforgettable night—
    The curtain slowly opened, and in the middle of the stage was a small table with a dancing statue of Shiva enshrined on it. On both sides were two lit tall copper lamps. The atmosphere on the stage was quiet and solemn.
    Kamala Lakshman came out. What a radiant flash! She bowed deeply to the audience with her palms together, and when she raised her head, she revealed her beautiful face, and that pair of long eyebrows and eyes that could speak thousands of words.
    She stood there dignifiedly.
    The flute played, the small drum beat, the song sang, and Kamala began to dance.
    She used her long eyebrows, beautiful eyes, fingers, waist; she used the flowers on her bun, the pleated skirt around her waist; she used her fine dance steps, the ringing bells, moving slowly like light clouds, spinning quickly like a whirlwind, dancing out the joys and sorrows of separation and reunion in poetry.
    Although we don't know the content of the story, our emotions resonate with her movements! We see her sometimes frowning, expressing infinite sorrow, sometimes smiling brightly, expressing boundless joy; sometimes lowering her eyelashes and turning sideways, expressing gentle and tactful shyness; sometimes opening her eyes wide and glaring, expressing the raging anger of dominating the world; sometimes gently touching her forehead and stroking her arms, drawing her eyes and eyebrows, performing delicate and appropriate makeup; sometimes standing upright, holding an arrow and drawing a bow, making people almost hear the clang of the strings! Like Shiva, in the revelry of the dance, she forgot the audience and herself. She only cared about using all her skills, using her flexible and skilled limbs and features, to tell the beautiful ancient Indian poems and stories!
    After one dance performance after another (the younger sister, Radha, sometimes dances alone, sometimes cooperates with her sister, she is a young phoenix! Although she is still young, her skills are already deep, and her future achievements are also immeasurable), we find that they not only represent gods and people, but also plants and animals: such as the opening and trembling of lotus petals, the swift running and leaping of a deer, the haughty stride of a peacock, can be described vividly and exquisitely! The most brilliant is the "snake dance", the light shaking of the neck, the slight trembling of the shoulders; a wave of supple wriggling, from the fingertips of the right hand, all the way to the fingertips of the left hand! I really can't describe it, I can only borrow two lines of poetry from Bai Juyi: "Pearl tassels swirling, stars shaking, floral garlands competing, dragons and snakes moving" to encompass it.
    Watching the dance of the Karama sisters makes people deeply appreciate the beautiful and long-standing culture and art of India: dance, music, sculpture, painting... all like branches on a large banyan tree, branches drooping and taking root in the ground. These many branches in the earth are connected with each other, absorbing the nourishment given to him by Mother Earth, and this earth is the broad masses of the Indian people with a long history.
    Kamala and Radha are just two soft branches on this large banyan tree. Although Kamala, at the age of twenty-two, has spent seventeen years on the stage; twelve-year-old Radha also has four years of performance experience, but we know that India's great Mother Earth will continue to give them nourishment and cultivation.
    What is most melancholy is that they have just shown the Chinese people their "swimming dragon"-like dance, and because of the needs of the broad masses of their motherland, they will "startle like a wild goose" and fly back in two or three days!
    The early spring in Beijing cannot find flowers as full and fragrant as their southern Indian hometown. Let me learn from their great poet Tagore's poetic saying: Let us string our hearts of admiration and gratitude, like red flowers, into garlands, dedicate them to them and hang them on their chests, and take them back to the Indian people, to thank them for their friendship and enthusiasm, and to thank them for temporarily sending the Lakshman sisters with great kindness!

    观舞记
    ——献给印度舞蹈家卡拉玛姐妹
    冰心
    我应当怎样地来形容印度卡拉玛姐妹的舞蹈？
    假如我是个诗人，我就要写一首长诗，来描绘她们的变幻多姿的旋舞。
    假如我是个画家，我就要用各种的彩色，渲点出她们的清扬的眉宇，和绚丽的服装。
    假如我是个作曲家，我就要用音符来传达出她们轻捷的舞步，和细响的铃声。
    假如我是个雕塑家，我就要在石膏上模拟出她们的充满了活力的苗条灵动的身形。
    然而我什么都不是！我只能用我自己贫乏的文字，来描写这惊人的舞蹈艺术。
    如同一个婴儿，看到了朝阳下一朵耀眼的红莲，深林中一只旋舞的孔雀，他想叫出他心中的惊喜，但是除了咿哑之外，他找不到合适的语言！
    但是，朋友，难道我就能忍住满心的欢喜和激动，不向你吐出我心中的“咿哑”？
    我不敢冒充研究印度舞蹈的学者，来阐述印度舞蹈的历史和派别，来说明她们所表演的婆罗多舞是印度舞蹈的正宗。我也不敢像舞蹈家一般，内行地赞美她们的一举手一投足，是怎样地准确，怎样地“出色当行”。
    我只是一个欣赏者，但是我愿意努力地说出我心中所感受的飞动的“美”！
    朋友，在一个难忘的夜晚——
    帘幕慢慢地拉开，台中间小桌上供养着一尊湿婆天的舞像，两旁是燃着的两盏高脚铜灯，舞台上的气氛是静穆庄严的。
    卡玛拉·拉克希曼出来了。真是光艳的一闪！她向观众深深地低头合掌，抬起头来，她亮出了她的秀丽的面庞，和那能说出万千种话的一对长眉，一双眼睛。
    她端凝地站立着。
    笛子吹起，小鼓敲起，歌声唱起，卡玛拉开始舞蹈了。
    她用她的长眉，妙目，手指，腰肢；用她髻上的花朵，腰间的折裙；用她细碎的舞步，繁响的铃声，轻云般慢移，旋风般疾转，舞蹈出诗句里的离合悲欢。
    我们虽然不晓得故事的内容，但是我们的情感，却能随着她的动作，起了共鸣！我们看她忽而双眉颦蹙，表现出无限的哀愁，忽而笑颊粲然，表现出无边的喜乐；忽而垂睫侧身，表现出低徊宛转的娇羞；忽而张目嗔视，表现出吒咤风云的盛怒；忽然轻柔地点额抚臂，画眼描眉，表演着细腻妥贴的梳妆；忽而挺身屹立，按箭引弓，使人几乎听得见铮铮的弦响！像湿婆天一样，在舞蹈的狂欢中，她忘怀了观众，也忘怀了自己。她只顾使出浑身解数，用她灵活熟练的四肢五官，来讲说着印度古代的优美的诗歌故事！
    一段一段的舞蹈表演过（小妹妹拉达，有时单独舞蹈，有时和姐姐配合，她是一只雏凤！形容尚小而工夫已深，将来的成就也是不可限量的），我们发现她们不但是表现神和人，就是草木禽兽：如莲花的花开瓣颤，小鹿的疾走惊跃，孔雀的高视阔步，都能形容尽致，尽态极妍！最精采的是“蛇舞”，颈的轻摇，肩的微颤；一阵一阵的柔韧的蠕动，从右手的指尖，一直传到左手的指尖！我实在描写不出，只能借用白居易的两句诗：“珠缨炫转星宿摇，花鬘斗薮龙蛇动”来包括了。
    看了卡拉玛姐妹的舞蹈，使人深深地体会到印度的优美悠久的文化艺术：舞蹈、音乐、雕刻、图画……都如同一条条的大榕树上的树枝，枝枝下垂，入地生根。这许多树枝在大地里面，息息相通、吸收着大地母亲给予他的食粮的供养，而这大地就是有着悠久历史的印度的广大人民群众。
    卡玛拉和拉达还只是这棵大榕树上的两条柔枝。虽然卡玛拉以她的二十二年华，已过了十七年的舞台生活；十二岁的拉达也已经有了四年的演出经验，但是我们知道印度的伟大的大地母亲，还会不断地给她们以滋润培养的。
    最使人惆怅的是她们刚显示给中国人民以她们“游龙”般的舞姿，因着她们祖国广大人民的需求，她们又将在两三天内“惊鸿”般地飞了回去！
    北京的早春，找不到像她们的南印故乡那样的丰满芬芳的花朵，让我学她们的伟大诗人泰戈尔的充满诗意的说法：让我们将我们一颗颗的赞叹感谢的心，像一朵朵的红花似地穿成花串，献给她们挂在胸前，带回到印度人民那里去，感谢他们的友谊和热情，感谢他们把拉克希曼姐妹暂时送来的盛意！
