    Kindergarten for Boat-Dwelling Families
    The children of the members of the Changzhou Fifth Wooden Boat Transportation Cooperative in Jiangsu Province have their own paradise – a kindergarten for boat-dwelling families.
    Cooperative Director Gao told the visitors: In the past, as soon as children on boats learned to walk, their parents felt like they were carrying a heavy burden, fearing that the children might accidentally fall into the river. Boat people had to place their hopes on the Bodhisattva, and even though life was hard, they still had to spend money to worship the "River God" for their children.
    During the upsurge of socialist transformation last year, the wooden sailboat cooperative was established, and women also participated in labor. Last National Day, in order to solve the problem of taking care of children, the cooperative allocated funds to build a new house on Guanhe Road and established the first kindergarten for boat-dwelling families in Changzhou. The Municipal Women's Federation sent a bicycle and a rocking horse, an elderly cooperative member became the cook, and there were two teachers, taking in more than forty children aged three to seven.
    With the kindergarten for boat-dwelling families, mothers can steer their boats with peace of mind. Some cooperative members have also reduced their financial burden because they no longer have to hire help.

    水上人家的幼儿园
    江苏常州市第五木船运输合作社社员的儿童，有了自己的乐园——水上人家的幼儿园。
    合作社高社长告诉去访问的人说：从前船上小孩子一学会走路，做父母的像担着千斤重担，怕孩子一个不留神掉在河里。船民只好把希望寄托在菩萨身上，生活虽苦，还要花钱为孩子祭“河神”。
    去年社会主义改造高潮中，成立了木帆船合作社，妇女们也参加了劳动。去年国庆节，合作社为了解决带孩子的问题，拨款在关河路新造起一间房子，成立了常州市第一个水上人家的幼儿园。市妇联送来一辆脚踏车和一匹木马，一个老年社员做了炊事员，有两位老师，收了四十多个三至七周岁的儿童。
    有了水上人家的幼儿园，妈妈们撑船心也宽。有的社员因为可以不再请人帮忙，还减轻了经济负担。
