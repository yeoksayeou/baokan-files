Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 2nd. Currently, leadership organs at all levels in Hebei Province have dispatched over 20,000 cadres to work at the grassroots level.

Starting from the provincial-level leadership organs, this province has adopted numerous measures to overcome bureaucratic work styles. The provincial organs are now preparing to further streamline their structures and send over 300 cadres at the division-chief level and above to settle down in the grassroots. Some of the larger departments in the provincial organs have mostly changed from a three-tier system to a two-tier system, thereby reducing the phenomenon of documents traveling through multiple levels and making the handling of affairs more flexible than before.

County-level organs are also striving to streamline their structures, generally dispatching about 20% of their cadres to work in townships or cooperatives.

Because the frequent contact between leading cadres and the masses has been strengthened compared to the past, the relationship has become even closer. Investigations from twelve counties, including Shahe, indicate that approximately sixty county Party committee members and county heads who previously stayed in their offices and did not frequently go to the countryside are now able to regularly immerse themselves among the masses. According to statistics from five counties, including Baodi, over 760 county and district cadres working in the townships have recently participated in local production activities such as accumulating fertilizer and delivering manure. The personal participation of leading cadres in production has greatly encouraged the peasant masses and powerfully promoted the unfolding of the spring plowing production campaign.

In order to effectively improve leadership styles, efforts are being made to overcome the phenomena of excessive meetings and reports. In the first two months of this year, Xingtai, Xingtang, and Jinghai counties in this province reduced unnecessary county-wide meetings by twenty-two compared to the same period last year. Jinghai County, by reducing meetings, saved over 10,000 workdays for grassroots cadres and the masses. In the first two months of this year, Xingtang County issued over one hundred and sixty fewer documents compared to November and December of last year.

### 公文逐级旅行减少　办事比过去灵活  河北抽调二万多干部深入基层

    公文逐级旅行减少　办事比过去灵活
    河北抽调二万多干部深入基层
    新华社保定2日电　河北省各级领导机关目前已经抽调了两万名以上的干部到基层去工作。
    这个省从省一级领导机关开始，采取了许多措施来克服官僚主义作风。现在省级机关准备进一步精简机构，并抽调三百多名处长级以上的干部深入到基层去安家落户。省级机关一些比较大的部门，大都由过去的三级制改为两级制，这样公文逐级旅行的现象减少，办事比过去灵活了。
    县一级机关也都尽量使机构精简，一般都抽调约20％左右的干部深入到乡或合作社去工作。
    由于领导干部同群众的经常联系比过去加强，关系就更加密切了。从沙河等十二个县的调查说明，有大约六十名中共县委委员和县长，过去坐守机关，不经常下乡，现在都能经常深入群众了。另据宝坻等五个县的统计，有七百六十多名在乡工作的县、区干部最近参加了当地的积肥、送粪等生产活动。领导干部亲自参加生产，给农民群众很大鼓舞，有力地推动了春耕生产运动的开展。
    为了切实改进领导作风，会议多、表报多的现象也正在努力克服。这个省的邢台、行唐、静海三个县在今年的头两个月比去年同期减少了不必要的全县规模的会议二十二次。静海县由于减少了会议，使基层干部和群众节省了一万多个劳动日。行唐县在今年头两个月下达的文件比去年11、12两个月减少了一百六十多件。
