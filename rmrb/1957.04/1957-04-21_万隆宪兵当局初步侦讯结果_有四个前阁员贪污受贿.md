Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 20th - The Army Intelligence Department announced yesterday that the Bandung Military Police had completed the first phase of interrogations of prominent figures arrested since the commencement of the anti-corruption campaign. The results of the interrogations indicate that four former cabinet ministers and five military personnel engaged in activities that harmed the interests of the nation and the people in financial and economic matters.

    A.K. Gani, who served as Minister of Transportation, accepted 1.75 million rupiah from a businessman during his tenure. He used this money in a rubber industry company he helped establish.

    Wibisono, the Minister of Finance in the previous cabinet, issued 400 million rupiah in government loans to enterprises guaranteed by certain political parties and prioritized government loans to enterprises supported by the ruling party. This practice only benefited certain groups.

    Lee Gie Ding, who served as Minister of Health, improperly acquired one-third of the shares of a hotel in Palembang during his tenure. Lee Gie Ding used a private company under his responsibility as an intermediary to purchase the hotel.

    Arifin, the First Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly and Deputy Prime Minister in the First Sastroamidjojo Cabinet, illegally obtained a loan of 2.5 million rupiah from the government in the name of his Waras Company.

    Among the five military personnel who violated the law was Lieutenant Colonel Prayogo, one of the main defendants in the corruption case of Li Futai, the former Deputy Director of the National Printing Factory.
