    A Good Subject
    Fú Xiān
    I hope that a Chinese Gogol will appear. I would like to make a request to him: please write a play in the style of "The Government Inspector," or a novel in the style of "Dead Souls," reflecting the social aspects of the "Yang Mei Incident" that caused a sensation throughout the Kuomintang-controlled areas in 1947.
    Many people know about this incident, so I won't go into detail. The gist is: a child bride from a peasant family in Sichuan, abused by her mother-in-law and denied food, simply didn't eat, but survived. "Nine years without food," yet she didn't die and could even work. Somehow, Yang Sen found out about this miracle and took her to Chongqing, recognized her as his adopted daughter, and promoted and exhibited her widely. Thus, this Yang Mei became a problematic figure, with news of her appearing in newspapers every day, attracting widespread attention from all walks of life. Many scientists—biologists, physiologists, medical scientists, chemists...—took her as an object of scientific research and published many research papers, providing scientific arguments that people could live without eating; but there were also those who fundamentally doubted the truth of this miracle. Many old and new literary giants naturally wrote poems and essays, praising this extraordinary person. Love experts wrote love letters every day, unwilling to lose such an unprecedented opportunity. The common people were also very excited, because the experience of being able to live without eating would soothe the complaints of their hungry stomachs. The ruling class, on the other hand, was even more interested in this experience that the common people were interested in. This was not because they themselves wanted to stop eating, but because this experience would allow them to drive the common people, who did not need to eat, to produce for them, and to "suppress" the communists and oppose the Soviet Union. In this way, troubles such as strikes and resistance to grain taxes would fundamentally be impossible, and the war to "suppress" the communists and oppose the Soviet Union would certainly be won, and, moreover, this would first refute the Communist Party's "materialist conception of history" in "theory." Therefore, the happiest people were those like Yang Sen, who recognized Yang Mei as his adopted daughter without feeling the slightest bit of condescension.
    However, it is said that a nurse in some hospital did something very offensive. She examined Yang Mei and finally discovered that this miraculous woman had peanuts sewn into her clothes. Furthermore, it was revealed that during the nine years of "not eating," Yang Mei had been secretly eating pig feed and wild fruits every day!
    According to the article "Yang Mei Today" published in the "Chongqing Daily" on March 2nd of this year, this was entirely a scam manufactured by the reactionaries at the time.
    Just the part up to the exposure of the scam can serve as a subject for a great literary work. The author would already be extremely brilliant if they wrote up to this point. What's more, Yang Mei after liberation (now named Yang Bosheng) has become a member of the Leijiaping Senior Agricultural Cooperative in Longsha Township, Shizhu County, Sichuan Province, works very actively, and has established a happy family with a five-year-old child. What a great "sequel" this is! It is said that Gogol had to destroy the manuscript of the second part of "Dead Souls" because he could not write well about the bright side of Russia at that time, but today China's Gogol will certainly be able to write a good sequel to the "Yang Mei Incident"!

    一个好题材
    弗先
    但愿我国出现一个果戈里，我想对他提一个请求，请他写一本“钦差大臣”体的剧本，或者写一本“死魂灵”体的小说，反映一下1947年轰动了整个国民党统治区的“杨妹事件”的社会相。
    这事件是很多人知道的，我倒不详细。那梗概是：四川的一个农家的童养媳，为婆子娘所虐待，得不到饭吃，她就不吃，但是活下来了，“九年不食”，非但不死，还能劳动。不知怎的，这奇事被杨森知道了，他把她接到重庆去，认为义女，而且大事宣传、展览起来。这杨妹，于是成了问题人物，报纸上天天登她的消息，广泛地引起各界人士的注意。许多的科学家——生物学家、生理学家、医学家、化学家……把她作为科学研究的对象，而且发表了许多研究论文，纷纷提供了人不吃饭而可以生活的科学论据；但也有根本怀疑这奇事的真实性的。许多新旧文豪，自然是吟诗作赋，歌颂这位奇人。恋爱专家，则天天写情书，不肯失去这样一个旷古所无的奇缘。老百姓也发生很大的兴奋，那是因为，不吃饭而能生活的经验，会得平服他们的饿得发慌的肚子的叫苦。统治阶级，则从另一方面对老百姓感到兴趣的这个经验感到更大的兴趣，这并不是因为他们自己也想停止吃饭，而是，这一条经验，会使他们可以驱使不必吃饭的老百姓替他们去生产，而且替他们去“剿”共、反苏。这样，罢工、抗粮之类的乱子既根本无从发生，“剿”共、反苏的战争又一定能够胜利了，而且，这首先就在“理论”上驳倒了共产党的“唯物史观”。所以，最快乐的还是杨森之流的人，他们认杨妹为义女，丝毫也不觉得屈尊。
    然而，据说是什么医院里的一个护士，干了一件大怫人心的事情。她对杨妹实行了检查，终于发现了这个奇女的衣衫里，缝装着花生米。进一步，又弄穿了那“不食”的九年之中，杨妹是天天偷吃了猪食和野果的！
    根据今年3月2日“重庆日报”发表的“今日杨妹”一文的材料，这完全是当时反动派所制造的骗局。
    仅仅到骗局被拆穿的那一段，就可以作为一部伟大的文艺作品的题材了。作者如果写到这里为止，已极精彩。何况解放后的杨妹（现名杨伯生）已成为四川省石砫县龙沙乡雷家坪高级农业社社员，劳动很积极，已建立了幸福的家庭，有了一个五岁的孩子。这又是何等伟大的“续篇”！据说果戈里因写不好当时俄国的光明面而不得不手毁“死魂灵”第二部的手稿，而今天我国的果戈里一定能够写好“杨妹事件”的续篇！
