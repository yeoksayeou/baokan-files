Xinhua News Agency Report: Amidst the situation where Jordanian King Hussein requested, the Jordanian cabinet headed by Prime Minister Nabulsi resigned on April 10th.

American newspapers revealed that the resignation of the Nabulsi cabinet was due to the United States' attempt to force Jordan to accept the Eisenhower Doctrine. According to a report from Washington by Higgins Margaret, a reporter for the "New York Herald Tribune," "It is believed here that special envoy James Richards' visit, aimed at promoting the Eisenhower Doctrine, may help in the struggle between Jordanian conservatives and leftists... For example, it is known that King Hussein very much hopes that Richards will come to Jordan, but Prime Minister Nabulsi is unwilling to issue an invitation under the conditions acceptable to the American." Higgins exposed the true intentions of American officials, saying that the events in Jordan would break down the alliance between Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan.

According to reports from Amman, the forced resignation of the Nabulsi cabinet has caused a tense situation in Jordan. Broad public opinion protested against the imperialist conspiracy against Jordan and expressed support for the Nabulsi cabinet.

The Guidance Committee, an Arab organization representing all national groups, decided to send a telegram to the King expressing regret over the dismissal of the Nabulsi cabinet after a meeting in the Jordanian sector of Jerusalem on the 11th. The telegram demanded the establishment of a national united government that favored neutralism, opposed joining alliances, especially the Eisenhower Doctrine, and supported the establishment of a federation between Jordan and Syria and Egypt. The statement said that they fully supported the policies of the Nabulsi cabinet.

Four political parties with significant influence in parliament, including the National Socialist Party, the National Front, and the Arab Ba'ath Party, also issued statements on the same day, condemning the forces that forced the Nabulsi cabinet to resign and the imperialist conspiracy. The statements assured the Jordanian people that they were determined to eliminate foreign forces and form a federation with Egypt and Syria as the first step towards achieving full Arab unity.

The people of Amman, the capital of Jordan, and the major city of Nablus held demonstrations one after another, demanding the reinstatement of Prime Minister Nabulsi.

After Nabulsi's resignation, the newly appointed Jordanian Police Chief and King's Adjutant, Muhammad Maita, ordered the arrest of patriots. Telecommunications between Amman and the outside world have been cut off. The army has set up roadblocks on all major highways throughout the country.

Meanwhile, King Hussein has appointed former Foreign Minister Hussein Fakhri al-Khalidi to form a new government. Khalidi spent the entire day on the 11th organizing the cabinet, but there have been no concrete results. The National Socialist Party, the Arab Ba'ath Party, and the National Front, which had representatives in the Nabulsi cabinet, have all decided not to participate in the new cabinet.

According to a report from Damascus Radio on the evening of the 11th, Syrian political figures are closely watching the development of the political situation in Jordan with great concern. It is believed that the resignation of the Nabulsi cabinet is related to the conspiracy of the reactionary forces in Jordan actively supported by the United States, and also to the conspiracy to separate Jordan from the free Arab countries' front including Egypt and Syria.

The radio station expressed its hope that the current crisis in Jordan can be properly resolved in accordance with the guidelines jointly chosen by the Jordanian King, people, government, and army.

    在艾森豪威尔主义黑风侵袭下
    纳布西内阁辞职　约旦局势紧张化
    全国公众谴责帝国主义阴谋并要求纳布西复职
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：在约旦国王侯赛因的要求下，以纳布西首相为首的约旦内阁在4月10日辞职。
    美国报刊透露，纳布西内阁的辞职，是由于美国企图强使约旦接受艾森豪威尔主义。据“纽约先驱论坛报”记者希金斯·玛格丽特从华盛顿报道说，“此地认为，以宣传艾森豪威尔主义为目的的特使詹姆斯·理查兹这次的访问，可能有助于约旦保守派和左派分子斗争的过程……例如，大家知道，侯赛因国王非常希望理查兹到约旦来，但是纳布西首相却不愿在这个美国人所能接受的条件下发出邀请。”希金斯暴露了美国官方人士的真正意图，他说，约旦的事件会使埃及、沙特阿拉伯和约旦之间的联盟瓦解。
    据安曼消息：纳布西内阁的被迫辞职在约旦引起了紧张的局势。广泛的公众舆论抗议帝国主义对约旦的阴谋，并且表示支持纳布西内阁。
    代表全国一切团体的阿拉伯组织——指导委员会11日在耶路撒冷约旦区举行会议后决定打电报给国王对纳布西内阁的解职表示遗憾。电报要求成立一个赞成中立主义、反对参加联盟特别是反对艾森豪威尔主义、支持约旦同叙利亚和埃及建立联邦的全国联合政府。声明说，他们完全支持纳布西内阁的政策。
    国家社会党、全国阵线、阿拉伯复兴党等四个在议会中拥有巨大影响的政党也在同一天发表声明，谴责迫使纳布西内阁辞职的势力和帝国主义的阴谋。声明向约旦人民保证，它们决心要清除外国势力，并且同埃及和叙利亚结成联邦作为达到阿拉伯充分团结的第一步。
    约旦首都安曼和主要城市纳布鲁斯人民先后举行了示威，并且要求使纳布西首相复职。
    在纳布西辞职后，新任约旦警察总监、国王侍从武官长穆罕默德·马伊塔下令逮捕爱国人士。安曼同外界的电讯交通已经断绝。军队在全国所有的主要公路上布置了路障。
    同时，侯赛因国王已经任命前外交大臣侯赛尼·斐赫里·哈利迪组织新政府。哈利迪在11日进行了一整天的组阁活动，但是还没有具体的结果。有代表参加纳布西内阁的国家社会党、阿拉伯复兴党和全国阵线都决定不参加新内阁。
    另据大马士革电台11日晚报道，叙利亚政界人士正以极大的关怀注视着约旦政局的发展。并且认为，纳布西内阁的辞职同美国所积极支持的约旦反动势力的阴谋有关，也同使约旦脱离包括埃及和叙利亚在内的自由阿拉伯国家阵线的阴谋有关。
    电台表示希望约旦目前的危机能够按照约旦国王和人民、政府和军队所共同选择的方针得到良好的解决。
