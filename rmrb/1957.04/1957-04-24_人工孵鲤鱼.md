Local Scene:

    The Hongqi (Red Flag) Cooperative in Guangji County, Hubei Province, has successfully experimented with artificial incubation of carp. This spring, the cooperative bought back twenty-three female carp and forty-two male carp and placed them in a sunny pond. After the Qingming Festival, they tied several willow roots and broken raincoats and inserted them into the pond to allow the carp to lay their eggs on them. Then, they removed the egg-bearing materials and placed them in another pond. On the fourth day, the small fish hatched. They have now hatched more than 600,000 small carp.

    人工孵鲤鱼
    湖北广济县红旗社试行人工孵鲤鱼成功。今年开春，社里买回二十三条母鲤鱼，四十二条公鲤鱼，放在阳光充足的水塘里，清明节后，扎了几把杨柳树根和破蓑衣把子，插在池里，让鲤鱼在上边产卵，然后把带卵的把子抽出来，放在另一个塘里，到第四天就孵化出了小鱼，现在已经孵化出六十多万尾小鲤鱼。　　　　（摘自各地报纸）
