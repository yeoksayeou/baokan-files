All German People Share the Same Sentiment:
    Oppose the Arming of West German Troops with Atomic Weapons

    (Reported by this newspaper) While leading figures of the West German government constantly clamor for West German troops to possess atomic weapons, eighteen of West Germany's most prominent atomic scientists jointly issued the Göttingen Manifesto on the 12th, opposing the arming of West German troops with atomic weapons and opposing the use of their scientific achievements for war purposes.
    This declaration was issued in the name of the West German scientific research organization "Max Planck" Institute. The declaration was signed by world-renowned German atomic scientists, including Nobel Prize winners Hahn, Heisenberg, Max Born, von Laue, and Weizsäcker.
    The declaration of the eighteen West German scientists has aroused widespread sympathetic reaction. Prominent atomic scientists of East Germany issued a joint statement on the 14th, expressing their support for the West German atomic scientists' call to stop arming West German troops with atomic weapons.
    Deputy Prime Minister Selbmann of the German Democratic Republic said in a radio speech that the government of the German Democratic Republic agrees with the call of the West German scientists.
    Chairman Dieckmann of the Presidium of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic said when receiving reporters from Berlin Democratic Radio that the call of the West German scientists is a victory for the peace movement.

    全德人民人同此心
    反对西德军队装备原子武器
    本报讯　在西德政府领导人物不断叫嚣要求西德军队拥有原子武器的时候，西德十八位最著名的原子科学家12日联合发表了戈丁根宣言，反对以原子武器装备西德军队，并反对把他们的科学成就用于战争目的。
    这个宣言是以西德科学研究团体“马克斯—普朗克”研究所的名义发表的。在这个声明上签名的有世界著名的德国原子科学家诺贝尔奖金获得者哈恩、海森贝尔、马克斯·波恩、冯劳埃、维茨沙寇等。
    西德十八名科学家的宣言已引起广泛的同情反应。民主德国著名原子科学家14日发表联合声明，表示支持西德原子科学家要求停止用原子武器装备西德军队的呼吁。
    德意志民主共和国副总理赛尔布曼在电台发表演说时说，德意志民主共和国政府同意西德科学家的呼吁。
    德意志民主共和国人民议院主席团主席狄克曼在接见柏林民主电台的记者的时候说，西德科学家的呼吁是和平运动的胜利。
