    Blossoms of Southern Photography Art
    Exhibition of Photographic Works by Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Macao Photographers Opens
    An exhibition of photographic works by Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Macao photographers opened on the 7th at the exhibition hall of the Chinese Artists Association in Beijing.

    Many of the more than 220 works on display are of a high artistic standard. Jian Qingfu's "Sea Love" captures seven seagulls, each in a different pose but all facing the same direction. Each seagull's wings and body form a triangle, while the seawater ripples in circular patterns. The work titled "Bravery and Fierceness in Fighting" at first glance appears to be a traditional Chinese painting: two mantises fiercely battling on a flowering branch, accompanied by two lines of inscription by the author Zhang Baoji, and a bright red seal.

    This exhibition also features many works with strong political content. In front of an advertising sign for a luxurious "Restaurant" in Hong Kong, three impoverished women eat on the street; this is a fine piece by Yan Zhendong. Chen Ji's "Searching for a Living in the Garbage Heap" and "This Side and That Side" both document the painful lives of the impoverished people of Hong Kong. There are also many works taken from extremely ordinary scenes, such as Mai Feng's "Vegetable Market" and Tan Guojun's "Water People," etc. Due to the authors' skillful techniques, these ordinary scenes have become extraordinary pictures.

    The exhibition is sponsored by the China Photographic Society and is scheduled to close on April 21st.

### 南国摄影艺术的花朵  穗港澳摄影家作品展览开幕

    南国摄影艺术的花朵
    穗港澳摄影家作品展览开幕
    穗港澳摄影家作品展览7日在北京中国美术家协会展览馆开幕。
    这次展出的二百二十多幅作品中有很多具有高度的艺术水准。简庆福的“海恋”拍摄了七只姿态各不相同、但头都朝着同一个方向的海鸥，每只海鸥的翅膀和身体都构成三角形，而海水却泛着圆形的波纹。题为“好勇斗狠”的那幅乍一看以为是一幅国画：两只螳螂在花枝上狠斗，旁边是作者张宝基的两行题字，还有一颗鲜红的印章。
    这个展览会上还有许多有着强烈政治内容的作品。在香港一个豪华的“酒家”的广告牌前，三个贫苦妇女在街头进餐，这是颜振东的一幅佳作。陈迹的“垃圾堆里找生活”、“这边和那边”都纪录了香港贫苦人民痛苦的生活。还有不少作品取材于一些极平凡的场景，如麦峰的“菜场”、谭国鋆的“水上人家”等等，都由于作者手法高明，使平凡的场景也成为不平凡的图画。
    这个展览会是中国摄影学会主办的，定4月21日闭幕。
