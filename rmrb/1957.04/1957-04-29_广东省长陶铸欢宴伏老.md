Voroshilov spoke at the banquet.

Only the Chinese people, imbued with the idea of friendship with the Soviet people, can express such a frenzied climax of joy. The friendship and unity between the Soviet and Chinese peoples is a guarantee of the happiness and prosperity of the peoples of the two countries and all freedom-loving, peace-loving people in the world. Finally, he raised his glass to the sincere friendship between the fraternal peoples of China and the Soviet Union, and to the health of the leaders of the People's Republic of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong.

At the beginning of the banquet, Governor Tao Zhu delivered a speech. He said that we will always cherish the profound friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union, which is as deep as brothers, and sincerely hope that the friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union, like the grasses, trees, and flowers of the South, will bloom in all seasons and remain evergreen forever.

At the banquet, Soviet Minister of Higher Education Yelyutin announced that he was entrusted by Chairman Voroshilov to present a batch of gifts to Sun Yat-sen University—2,500 books, including works of science and art. Xu Chongqing, President of Sun Yat-sen University, raised his glass, walked to Chairman Voroshilov, and expressed his gratitude.
