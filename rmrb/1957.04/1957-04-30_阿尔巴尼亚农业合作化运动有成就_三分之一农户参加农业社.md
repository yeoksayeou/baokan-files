　　Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, April 28th: During the first four months of this year, the development figures for agricultural production cooperatives in Albania have reached 77% of the annual target. This means that the number of agricultural production cooperatives is expected to increase from 881 at the end of 1956 to 1,400 this year, and it has already reached 1,285.

　　Compared with 1955 (the last year of the first Five-Year Plan), the number of agricultural production cooperatives nationwide has increased more than threefold.

　　Currently, the number of farmers participating in agricultural production cooperatives accounts for 33% of the total number of farmers in the country, and their cultivated land area accounts for 40.8% of the total cultivated land area in the country. If the land of state-owned farms is added, the land owned by socialist agriculture accounts for 44.7% of the total cultivated land area in the country. Due to the rapid development of agricultural cooperativization, many fully cooperativized areas have emerged nationwide.

    新华社地拉那28日电　在今年头四个月期间，阿尔巴尼亚农业生产合作社的发展数字已经达到了全年预定数字的77％。这就是说，今年农业生产合作社的数目预定将从1956年底的八百八十一个增加到一千四百个，而现在已经达到了一千二百八十五个。
    如果同1955年（第一个五年计划的最末一年）相比，全国农业生产合作社共增加了三倍多。
    目前，参加农业生产合作社的农户已经占全国农户总数的33％，它们的耕地面积占全国耕地总面积的40.8％。如加上国营农场的土地，社会主义农业所拥有的土地占全国耕地总面积的44.7％。由于农业合作化的迅速发展，全国已经出现了不少全部合作化了的地区。
