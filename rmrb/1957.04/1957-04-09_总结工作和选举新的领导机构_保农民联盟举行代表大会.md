Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, April 8th - The 29th Congress of the Bulgarian Peasants Union was held in Sofia from the 5th to the 7th. The meeting summarized the Union's past work, revised the Union's charter, and elected new leadership bodies.

　　At the opening meeting on the 5th, Trakov, General Secretary of the Peasants Union, delivered a report summarizing the work since the 28th Congress of the Peasants Union. He pointed out that the Peasants Union organization has become a factor in Bulgaria's struggle to build socialism. Currently, the Peasants Union has 3,786 grassroots organizations and 120,000 members. 80,000 members have joined agricultural production cooperatives, with 22,000 of them holding various leadership positions in the cooperatives and 349 members awarded the "Order of People's Labor." Peasants Union members also play a significant role in the grassroots organizations of the Fatherland Front. On the other hand, the work of Peasants Union organizations at all levels also has some shortcomings, and the work of many grassroots organizations cannot keep up with the needs of socialist construction development. Trakov said that the Peasants Union's slogan now is: "Every Union member – a skilled producer!" He called on every Union member to work harder in the future and fight to consolidate agricultural production cooperatives, achieve bumper harvests, and increase livestock productivity. Trakov also urged Peasants Union members to continuously strengthen their unity with Communist Party members.

　　After heated discussions, the congress adopted a resolution and a draft revision of the Peasants Union charter, and elected Trakov and 54 others as members of the Executive Committee, with an additional 30 as alternate members.

　　During the congress, the Presidium of the Bulgarian National Assembly awarded orders and medals to 45 veteran Peasants Union members who had made contributions in the anti-fascist struggle and socialist construction.

　　On the evening of the 7th, Todor Zhivkov, Yugov, and other leaders of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party met with all the newly elected members of the Peasants Union Executive Committee at the Council of Ministers Building.

    总结工作和选举新的领导机构
    保农民联盟举行代表大会
    据新华社索非亚电　保加利亚农民联盟第二十九次代表大会5日至7日在索非亚举行。会议总结了联盟过去的工作，修改联盟章程和选举新的领导机构。
    在5日的开幕会议上，农民联盟总书记特莱科夫作了关于农民联盟第二十八次代表大会以来的工作总结报告。他指出，农民联盟组织已经成为保加利亚的建设社会主义而进行斗争的一个因素。现在，农民联盟已经拥有三千七百八十六个基层组织，十二万盟员。有八万盟员加入了农业生产合作社。其中，二万二千人担任着农业生产合作社的各种领导工作，三百四十九个盟员获得了“人民劳动勋章”。在祖国阵线基层组织中，农民联盟盟员也起着很大的作用。另一方面，农民联盟各级组织的工作同时存在着一些缺点，许多基层组织的工作还赶不上社会主义建设发展的需要。特莱科夫说，现在，农民联盟的口号是：“每一个联盟盟员——丰产能手！”他要求每一个联盟盟员今后更加努力工作，为巩固农业生产合作社、为获得丰收和提高畜产品生产率而斗争。特莱科夫还要求农民联盟盟员不断加强同共产党员之间的团结。
    大会经过热烈讨论后，通过了一项决议和农民联盟章程修改草案，选出了特莱科夫等五十五人为执行委员会委员，另外三十人为候补委员。
    大会期间，保加利亚国民议会主席团曾经分别以勋章和奖章授予四十五个在反法西斯斗争中和社会主义建设事业方面有功绩的农民联盟老盟员。
    7日晚上，保加利亚共产党中央委员会领导人日夫科夫、于哥夫等在部长会议大厦接见了新选出的农民联盟执行委员会全体委员。
