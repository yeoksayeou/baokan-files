Shu Brocade and Tribute Satin

Sichuan has the reputation of being the "Ancient Kingdom of Cancong." Shu brocade, tribute satin and other valuable products have written brilliant pages in Chinese cultural history and world cultural history. Since liberation, Sichuan silk has regained its splendid brilliance, and its total export value can be exchanged for steel rails equivalent to more than eleven Chengdu-Chongqing railways.

In Sichuan, mulberry leaves have turned green all over the fields, and the girls who raise silkworms are busy cleaning silkworm rooms and repairing silkworm rearing equipment. Another season for raising spring silkworms has arrived.

The sales volume of beautiful and soft silk has been increasing in recent years. Domestically, sales in 1955 alone increased more than 400 times compared to 1950, and increased even more in 1956. In Moscow, Berlin, Warsaw, Prague, and cities in capitalist countries, people can see many women and children wearing beautiful and dazzling dresses made of Sichuan silk.

Silk is also an important raw material in industry. It can be used to make inner tire layers, airplane wings, parachutes, waterproof fishing nets, electric wire sheathing, and so on.

From liberation to January of this year, Sichuan Province has planted more than 400 million mulberry trees in suitable areas. Most of the 100 million mulberry trees planted in 1954 and 1955 have grown up and can be used to pick leaves to raise silkworms this year. This year, the province will plant another 280 million mulberry trees, striving to have 550 million grown mulberry trees in the province by 1959. After this plan is realized, more than 700,000 dan of cocoons can be produced by 1962, restoring the highest level of cocoon production in history.

    蜀锦和贡缎
    四川有“蚕丛古国”的称号。蜀锦、贡缎等名贵产品，曾在中国文化史和世界文化史上写下了光辉的篇页。解放以来，四川丝绸又恢复了绚烂的光彩，它出口的总值可以换回相当十一条成渝铁路的钢轨。
    在四川，桑叶已经绿遍了原野，养蚕的姑娘正忙着打扫蚕室和修补蚕具，又一个饲养春蚕的季节来到了。
    绮丽轻柔的丝绸，这几年来销量越来越大。在国内，仅1955年的销售量比1950年增加了四百多倍，1956年增加得更多。在莫斯科、柏林、华沙、布拉格以及资本主义国家的城市里，人们可以看到许多妇女和儿童，穿着四川丝绸制成美丽夺目的衣裙。
    丝绸还是工业上的重要原料。它可以制车胎内层、飞机翅膀、降落伞、耐水鱼网、电线包皮等等。
    从解放到今年1月，四川省在宜桑地区栽种了四亿多株桑树，其中1954年和1955年栽的一亿株桑树，大部分已成长起来，今年就可以采叶养蚕了。今年全省还要栽桑二亿八千万株，争取到1959年，全省成长桑树五亿五千万株。这个计划实现以后，到1962年就可以产茧七十多万担，恢复到历史上产茧量的最高水平。
