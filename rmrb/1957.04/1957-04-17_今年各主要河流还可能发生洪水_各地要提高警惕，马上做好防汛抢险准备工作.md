Floods May Still Occur in Major Rivers This Year
All Localities Should Heighten Vigilance and Immediately Prepare for Flood Prevention and Rescue Work
(Our Newspaper) News: Will major rivers across the country experience floods like last year? On the 16th, the person in charge of the General Office of the Central Flood Control Headquarters told reporters that, based on historical flood records and relevant material analysis, there is still a possibility of major floods occurring again this year. All localities should heighten vigilance and prepare for flood prevention and rescue in advance.

The person in charge of the General Office of the Central Flood Control Headquarters said that the timing of flood peaks has been earlier in recent years compared to the past. The Huai River system typically floods in July, but last year, the first flood occurred on June 3rd, forcing the Huai River project to halt. Wheat in the flood diversion and storage areas in Henan Province also suffered significant losses. Floods in the Yellow River usually occur in early to mid-August, with flood reports traditionally starting on July 1st. However, last year, a large flood occurred at Qinchang (in Wuzhi County, Henan Province) as early as June 26th. The same is true for rivers in North China. For example, the Hutuo River flooded in late June in 1954 and 1955, but the first flood occurred on June 3rd in 1956. Prior to 1956, some rivers saw earlier flood seasons. The Han River, which runs through Hubei, used to flood between July and September, but flooded as early as May 5th in 1952. In Northeast China, the flood season for the Songhua River also advanced from July and August to May in 1953.

The person in charge said that not only have floods arrived earlier in recent years, but also, judging from the hydrological data of many rivers, continuous years of major floods are not uncommon. In the Huai River system, the guaranteed water level at Zhengyangguan (Editor's note: The guaranteed water level for a certain dike section is the level at which flood control agencies can make every effort to protect and rescue it, preventing the river from breaching or overflowing; this level is called the guaranteed water level of the area.) was exceeded in 1950, 1954, and 1956. The Fuyang River and the Nanyun River in North China have experienced major floods for nearly four consecutive years, often exceeding the guaranteed water level. In the fifty-nine years of hydrological records for the Songhua River, only two to four years separated the occurrence of two major flood years during 1910-1915, 1932-1934, and 1953-1956. Therefore, there is still a possibility of floods occurring in various rivers this year.

The person in charge said that according to the typhoon outlook released by the Central Meteorological Science Research Institute, three or four typhoons may make landfall in July and August this year. At the same time, according to Soviet expert Goroglovich, the ground temperature this year is also higher than in previous years, and the evaporation from rivers and oceans is greater. Therefore, rainfall will also increase. Based on these factors, flood prevention work in all localities must be prepared now to avoid being caught off guard and causing losses.

### 今年各主要河流还可能发生洪水  各地要提高警惕，马上做好防汛抢险准备工作

    今年各主要河流还可能发生洪水
    各地要提高警惕，马上做好防汛抢险准备工作
    本报讯　今年全国各主要河流，会不会发生像去年那样的洪水？中央防汛总指挥部办公室负责人16日告诉记者说，根据历年的洪水记录和有关材料分析，今年仍然有再度出现大洪水的可能，各地应提高警惕，事先做好防汛抢险准备。
    中央防汛总指挥部办公室负责人说，这几年洪水涨发的时间，都比过去提早了。淮河水系一般情况都在7月间发水，但去年6月3日便发生了第一次洪水，治淮工程被迫停顿下来，河南境内分洪区和滞洪区的小麦，也遭到很大的损失。黄河洪水，一般发生在8月上中旬，一向是从7月1日开始报告汛情。但去年6月26日在秦厂（在河南省武陟县）即出现很大洪水。华北各河也是这样。例如滹沱河在1954年、1955年都在6月下旬发水，而1956年6月3日便发生第一次洪水。在1956年以前，有些河流汛情就在提早。纵贯湖北的汉江，过去发水都在7—9月间，而1952年5月5日就发水了。东北的松花江，1953年的发水期也由7、8月提早到5月。
    这位负责人说，不仅近几年洪水到来的时间比过去为早，而且从许多河流的水文资料来看，大洪水年连续出现的情况并不少。淮河水系，1950，1954，1956年正阳关的保证水位（编者注：防汛机构对某一堤段保证在一定的水位时能尽力防护抢救，不致河流溃决或漫溢；这个水位即称该地的保证水位。）都被突破；华北滏阳河和南运河近四年连续发生大水，而且多超过了保证水位。在松花江五十九年的水文记录中，1910—1915年，1932—1934年，1953—1956年，只在相隔二—四年间即发生了两个大水年。所以，今年各河流仍有出现洪水的可能。
    这位负责人说，据中央气象科学研究所发布的台风展望，今年7、8月间可能有三、四次台风登陆。同时，据苏联哥罗格洛维奇专家谈，今年的地面气温也比往年较高，河流和海洋的蒸发量较大，因此，降雨量也将有增加。根据这些情况，今年各地的防汛工作现在就必须做准备，以免临事张皇，造成损失。
