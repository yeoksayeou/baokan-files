The Socialist Transformation of Agriculture in Bulgaria

Great Achievements

Under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party, the socialist transformation of agriculture in the People's Republic of Bulgaria has achieved tremendous success.

Before liberation, Bulgaria was an agricultural country with fragmented land and backward technology. The lives of farmers were extremely miserable, suffering from the cruel exploitation of rich peasants and usurers, and often severely affected by natural disasters. At that time, more than 300,000 peasant households (about one-third of the total number of peasant households in the country) did not have enough land to support themselves, and each household only had one head of livestock, or none at all.

After the liberation on September 9, 1944, the Bulgarian Communist Party immediately began the socialist transformation of agriculture. On April 15, 1945, the National Assembly passed the Agricultural Production Cooperative Law. In 1946, a land reform was implemented, and land was rationally redistributed according to the principle of "land to the tiller," distributing 1.5 million decares (each decare equals 1.5 Chinese mu) of land to 130,000 landless and land-poor peasant households. In February 1947, the First National Congress of Agricultural Production Cooperatives was held, which determined the policy of land as shares and unified management. In 1950, the Second National Congress was held, which adopted the Model Charter of Agricultural Production Cooperatives, affirming the above policy. Then came the first upsurge of collectivization. By 1952, the last year of the First Five-Year Plan (1949-1953) – the First Five-Year Plan was completed one year ahead of schedule – there were 2,747 agricultural production cooperatives in the country, with cooperative households accounting for 52.3% of the total number of households in the country, and cooperative farmland accounting for 60.5% of the country's total farmland.

After a period of organizational and economic consolidation, from the second half of 1955 to the first half of 1956, there was a second upsurge of collectivization. By January of this year, there were 3,100 agricultural production cooperatives in Bulgaria, with a total of 911,037 member households, accounting for 78% of the country's peasant households. The cooperative farmland area was 35,217,000 decares, accounting for nearly 80% of the country's total farmland. The land that has not yet been collectivized is mainly in mountainous and semi-mountainous areas. The socialist transformation of agriculture in Bulgaria has been basically completed.

How the Achievements Were Obtained

The acquisition of these great achievements is first and foremost because the Party and the government have adopted correct policies. In leading this work, the Bulgarian Communist Party deeply studied the situation in rural Bulgaria, and based on its own specific conditions, resolutely adhered to the principle of voluntariness, guiding the working peasants to gradually transition to socialism through semi-socialist agricultural production cooperatives, thereby avoiding the mistakes of rashly advancing by directly establishing collective farms. At the same time, the Party and the government provided tremendous assistance to the cooperatives in terms of taxation, and adopted a policy of restricting rich peasants, cutting off the channels between peasants and capitalism.

Secondly, it is because the Bulgarian peasants, under the long-term leadership and education of the Party, have a long tradition in cooperation and have realized the superiority of cooperation from their own experience. Even before liberation, Bulgarian peasants had established 32 communal farming cooperatives under the leadership of the Party.

In addition, in order to ensure that cooperatives could increase production and improve the lives of their members, the Party and the government have taken many important measures over the past decade. The government has universally established machine tractor stations throughout the country as centers for promoting agricultural mechanization. By the end of 1956, a total of 184 machine tractor stations had been established across the country, with 24,600 tractors (calculated at 15 horsepower per tractor) and 4,100 grain combine harvesters. In 1952, machine tractor stations cultivated a cumulative total of 39.8 million decares of land for cooperatives, and in 1956, this figure had increased to 90 million decares. In 1956, the degree of mechanization of field work reached about 70%. There has also been great development in artificial irrigation. The irrigated area before liberation was only 375,000 decares (less than 1% of the total cultivated land), while by 1956 it had increased to 3.6 million decares. In addition to the construction of large reservoirs such as the Stalin Reservoir with a storage capacity of 660 million cubic meters, more than 800 small reservoirs have been built in cooperatives across the country. In 1956, the state supplied a total of 189,000 tons of chemical fertilizers to agriculture, an increase of 51% compared with 1955, while before liberation, only 12,000 to 15,000 tons of chemical fertilizers were used annually throughout the country. The Party and the government paid special attention to training cadres for the cooperatives. Since liberation, a total of 6,000 agricultural experts and 11,000 cadres with secondary agricultural knowledge have been sent to the countryside. In addition, the state has also organized agricultural scientific research work, providing many high-quality seeds and breeding livestock to the cooperatives.

These measures have greatly increased the output of agriculture, especially cooperative agriculture. In terms of agricultural output value, it already exceeded the highest pre-war level in 1951 (exceeding 29.8%). Not small achievements have also been made in animal husbandry. Compared with 1952, the number of cattle in cooperatives and state farms increased by 21.7% in 1955, sheep - 21.2%, pigs - 59.8%, and poultry - 33.6%. The output of various agricultural products in cooperatives generally exceeds the output of individual farmers by 15%-20%, and this figure is increasing year by year. Taking 1955 as an example, the average yield of wheat in cooperatives was 25.5% higher per decare than that of individual farmers, barley - 19.5%, and cotton - 40.2%. Therefore, the income of members has also increased year by year. The average remuneration of labor days nationwide increased from 7.15 leva (Bulgarian currency) in 1954 to 11.49 leva in 1955.

These achievements have not only further consolidated the cooperatives, but also attracted more and more individual farmers to voluntarily apply for membership.

The achievements of agricultural collectivization in Bulgaria are inseparable from the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has provided Bulgaria with great assistance in agricultural mechanization, agricultural science, and advanced experience. In 1955, 74.9% of all tractors and 82.1% of all grain combine harvesters owned by Bulgaria were supplied by the Soviet Union. In addition to helping Bulgaria build the Stalin United Fertilizer Plant with an annual output of 100,000 tons of chemical fertilizers during Bulgaria's First Five-Year Plan, according to the Soviet-Bulgarian economic agreement signed at the beginning of last year, Bulgaria was lent agricultural machinery worth 300 million rubles and a loan of 70 million rubles for the construction of two more large-scale chemical fertilizer plants between 1956 and 1959.

Difficulties and Shortcomings

Bulgaria has not been without difficulties and shortcomings in the development of agriculture and the socialist transformation of agriculture.

The backward situation left to the Bulgarian people by the former royal fascist government and the bourgeoisie has not been completely changed. Although the hardworking Bulgarian people have made efforts for more than a decade, the irrigated area in the country is still only about one-tenth of the total cultivated area. Therefore, Bulgaria still cannot have very stable harvests at present, and will have to greatly reduce production when encountering natural disasters. For example, in 1956, due to drought, the total agricultural output value decreased by about 9% compared with 1955, and it had to request the Soviet Union to lend a portion of wheat.

Secondly, in the process of collectivization, not enough attention was paid to the issue of animal husbandry, and the supply of feed was not guaranteed, so the development of animal husbandry was very slow. During the First Five-Year Plan, the number of cattle, horses, and sheep in the country did not reach the highest pre-war level. In particular, the development of animal husbandry in cooperatives was even slower. Although the number of livestock in cooperatives increased in 1956 compared with 1955, this was mainly the result of collectivization, and the number of livestock decreased when calculated as a proportion of land area. In order to reverse this situation, cooperatives across the country ensiled 2,756,000 tons of feed last year, exceeding 1955 by 59%.

In addition, there have also been shortcomings in the organizational work of agricultural production, the use of advanced science and technology, and the promotion of advanced experience.

Due to these reasons, the development of agriculture and animal husbandry has lagged behind the development of industry, and cannot well meet the growing needs of industry and the people. Although the total agricultural output value for 1957 is expected to increase by 32% compared with 1956, this figure is still 10% short of the agricultural development target set by the Sixth Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party for the last year (1957) of the Second Five-Year Plan.

But it should be pointed out that these difficulties and shortcomings are difficulties and shortcomings in the process of advancement and development, and the collectivization system is strong and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. Just as countless difficulties and shortcomings have been overcome in the past, with the leadership and assistance of the Party and the government, and through the efforts of the working peasants, the existing difficulties and shortcomings will inevitably be quickly overcome in the future.

New Measures

In order to further consolidate and develop agricultural production cooperatives, increase agricultural output, reduce agricultural production costs, and improve the material welfare of cooperatives and their members, the Bulgarian Communist Party and the government took a series of measures in the second half of 1956. The government revised its tax policy, abolished the compulsory purchase system for agricultural products other than grain and replaced it with a contract purchase system; the compulsory purchase price of grain was also increased, and different regulations were made according to the different natural conditions of various regions, and the compulsory grain purchase in mountainous areas was lifted; the prices of rural necessities such as chemical fertilizers and pesticides were lowered; farmers were encouraged to engage in sideline businesses; and the pension issues of cooperative members were resolved. These measures will not only increase the extra income of Bulgarian agricultural production cooperative members by 700 million leva in 1957, but will also greatly consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, which is the foundation of the country.

All these new measures have opened up infinitely broad paths for the further development of agricultural production and agricultural collectivization in Bulgaria. The great task of "completely realizing agricultural collectivization in the next two or three years on a completely voluntary basis" put forward by the Bulgarian Communist Party and the government in July last year will definitely be completed. The issue of abolishing land remuneration will also be fully resolved in the near future with the increase in agricultural production, the continuous growth of socialist components, the continuous improvement of socialist consciousness of members, and the implementation of the cooperative member pension law.

Today, with the overall development of the national economy, Bulgaria has become an industrial-agricultural country with modern industry and mechanized cooperative agriculture.

The brilliant achievements of the socialist transformation of agriculture in Bulgaria eloquently illustrate that the agricultural cooperative economy has unparalleled superiority over the individual small-scale peasant economy, and prove that the socialist transformation of agriculture is the only correct path to further develop agriculture and enable peasants to get rid of poverty and achieve a happy life.

    保加利亚农业的社会主义改造
    砚节
    巨大的成就
    保加利亚人民共和国农业的社会主义改造事业，在保加利亚共产党的领导下，已经取得了巨大的成就。
    解放前的保加利亚是一个土地分散、技术落后的农业国，农民的生活极其悲惨，遭受富农和高利贷的残酷剥削，并且经常受到自然灾害的严重侵袭。当时，全国有三十万以上农户（约占全国农户的三分之一）的土地不能自足，同时每户只有一头牲口，或者根本没有。
    1944年9月9日解放以后，保加利亚共产党立即开始了农业的社会主义改造工作。1945年4月15日国民议会通过了农业生产合作社法。1946年实行了土地改革，按“耕者有其田”的原则重新合理地分配了土地，将一百五十万狄卡尔（每狄卡尔合一市亩半）的土地分给十三万无地和少地的农户。1947年2月召开了农业生产合作社第一次全国代表大会，大会确定了土地入股、统一经营的方针。1950年召开了第二次全国代表大会，通过了农业生产合作社示范章程，肯定了上述方针。接着就到来了合作化的第一次高潮。到第一个五年计划（1949—1953年）的最后一年——1952年（第一个五年计划提前一年完成），全国已有两千七百四十七个农业生产合作社，合作化的农户占全国总农户的52.3％，合作社耕地面积占全国耕地面积的60.5％。
    经过了一段在组织上和经济上整顿和巩固的时期以后，从1955年下半年到1956年上半年，又出现了合作化的第二次高潮。到今年1月，保加利亚全国共有三千一百个农业生产合作社，入社总农户为九十一万一千零三十七户，占全国农户的78％，合作社耕地面积为三千五百二十一万七千狄卡尔，占全国耕地总面积近80％。尚未合作化的土地主要在山区和半山区。保加利亚农业的社会主义改造事业已经基本上完成了。
    成就是怎样取得的
    这些巨大成就的获得首先是因为党和政府采取了正确的政策。保加利亚共产党在领导这项工作时，深入地研究了保加利亚农村的情况，根据本国的具体条件，坚决遵守自愿的原则，引导劳动农民通过半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社，逐步过渡到社会主义，从而避免了直接建立集体农庄的急躁冒进的错误。同时，党和政府在税收等方面给合作社以巨大的帮助，并对富农采取了限制的政策，切断了农民同资本主义之间的通路。
    其次，是因为保加利亚的农民在党的长期领导和教育下，在合作化方面有着较久的传统，并从切身体验中认识了合作化的优越性。还在解放以前，保加利亚农民就在党的领导下建立了三十二个共耕社。
    另外，党和政府为了保证使合作社确能增产和改善社员的生活，十几年来采取了许多重要的措施。政府在全国各地普遍建立了机器拖拉机站，作为推广农业机械化的中心。到1956年底，全国共建立了一百八十四个机器拖拉机站，拥有两万四千六百台拖拉机（每台按十五匹马力计算）、四千一百台谷物联合收割机。1952年机器拖拉机站为合作社累计共耕了三千九百八十万狄卡尔土地，而在1956年，这个数字已增为九千万狄卡尔。1956年田间工作的机械化程度已达70％左右。在人工灌溉方面也有了很大的发展，解放前的灌溉面积只有三十七万五千狄卡尔（不到全部耕地的1％），而到1956年已增为三百六十万狄卡尔。除去建造了像蓄水量达六亿六千万立方公尺的斯大林水库等大型水库外，在全国合作社共建成了八百多个小型水库。1956年国家供给农业共十八万九千吨化学肥料，比1955年增加了51％，而在解放前全国每年只用一万二千到一万五千吨化学肥料。党和政府特别注意为合作社培养干部，解放以来，共向农村输送了六千名农业专家和一万一千名具有中等农业知识的干部。此外，国家还组织了农业的科学研究工作，给合作社提供了许多优良种子和种畜。
    这些措施使农业特别是合作社农业的产量有了很大的提高。在农业产值方面，早在1951年就已经超过了战前的最高水平（超过29.8％）。在畜牧业方面也取得了不小的成绩，以1955年同1952年相比，合作社和国营农场的牛的头数增加了21.7％，羊—21.2％，猪—59.8％，家禽—33.6％。合作社的各种农产品产量一般超过个体农民的产量15％—20％，而且这个数字还在逐年增加。以1955年为例，合作社小麦的产量比个体农民的产量平均每狄卡尔多25.5％，大麦—19.5％，棉花—40.2％。因此社员的收入也逐年增加，全国劳动日的平均报酬从1954年的七点一五列弗（保币）增为1955年的十一点四九列弗。
    这些成就不仅进一步巩固了合作社，而且还吸引越来越多的个体农民主动地申请入社。
    保加利亚农业合作化的成就是同苏联的无私援助分不开的。苏联在农业机械化、农业科学、先进经验等方面都给保加利亚以大力援助。1955年保加利亚所拥有的全部拖拉机的74.9％、全部谷物联合收割机的82.1％都是苏联供给的。苏联除了在保加利亚第一个五年计划期间帮助建成了年产达十万吨化学肥料的斯大林联合肥料厂外，根据去年年初签订的苏保经济协定，在1956—1959年间贷给保加利亚以价值三亿卢布的农业机器，并给以七千万卢布的贷款，作为建造另外两个大型化学肥料厂之用。
    困难和缺点
    保加利亚在发展农业和农业的社会主义改造中并不是没有困难和缺点的。
    过去的保皇法西斯政府和资产阶级遗留给保加利亚人民的落后状况还没有完全改变。虽然经过了勤劳的保加利亚人民十几年的努力，但到现在全国灌溉面积还只有全部耕地面积的十分之一左右。因此，保加利亚目前还不能有十分稳定的收成，遇到自然灾害还要大大减产，譬如1956年由于天气干旱，农业生产总值比1955年减少约9％，因而不得不请求苏联贷给一部分小麦。
    其次，在合作化的过程中，没有足够地注意畜牧业问题，饲料的供应也没有得到保障，因而畜牧业发展得很慢。在第一个五年计划期间，全国牛、马、羊的头数都还没有达到战前的最高水平。特别是合作社的畜牧业发展得更慢。1956年合作社的牲畜头数虽然较1955年增加了，但这主要是合作化的结果，而按土地面积比例计算，牲畜的头数还减少了。为了扭转这种状况，全国合作社已在去年青贮了二百七十五万六千吨饲料，超过1955年59％。
    此外，在农业生产的组织工作、利用先进科学技术和推广先进经验等方面也存在过缺点。
    由于这些原因，农牧业的发展都落后于工业的发展，还不能很好地满足工业和人民的日益增长的需要。虽然1957年的农业生产总值预计将较1956年增加32％，但这个数字比保共第六次代表大会为第二个五年计划最后一年（1957年）所规定的农业发展指标还差10％。
    但是应该指出，这些困难和缺点都是前进中、发展中的困难和缺点，而合作化制度是坚强有力、深入人心的。正如过去克服了无数困难和缺点一样，今后在党和政府的领导和帮助下，经过劳动农民的努力，现有的这些困难和缺点必将迅速地得到克服。
    新的措施
    保加利亚共产党和政府为了进一步巩固和发展农业生产合作社、增加农业产量、降低农业生产成本和提高合作社和社员的物质福利，在1956年下半年又采取了一系列的措施。政府修改了税收政策，废除了除谷物以外的农产品的义务征购制而代以合同收购制；谷物的义务征购价格也提高了，并按各地自然条件的不同分别规定，解除了山区的谷物义务征购；降低了化学肥料、农药等农村必需品的价格；鼓励农民经营副业；解决了合作社社员的养老金问题。这些措施不仅将使保加利亚农业生产合作社社员在1957年增加七亿列弗的额外收入，而且还将大大地巩固作为国家基础的工农联盟。
    这一切新的措施为保加利亚的农业生产和农业合作化的进一步发展开辟了无限广阔的道路。保加利亚共产党和政府在去年7月间提出的“在完全自愿的基础上，在今后两三年内全部实现农业合作化”的伟大任务，是一定可以完成的。而取消土地报酬的问题，也将随着农业生产的增加、社会主义成分的不断增长、社员的社会主义觉悟的不断提高，社员养老金法的执行，在不久的将来全部解决。
    今天，随着国民经济的全面发展，保加利亚已经成为一个拥有现代化工业和机械化的合作农业的工业—农业国家了。
    保加利亚农业社会主义改造事业所取得的辉煌成就，雄辩地说明了农业合作经济较之个体小农经济具有无比的优越性，证明了农业的社会主义化是进一步发展农业、使农民摆脱贫困和获得幸福生活的唯一正确的道路。（附图片）
