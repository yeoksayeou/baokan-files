Comrades,

We are very honored to come to this famous city and meet with you. Please allow me to express my heartfelt gratitude to you, the men, women, and children of Anshan City, for your warm, grand, and fraternal welcome to us, and to convey to you the profound respect from the bottom of the hearts of the Soviet working people. Dear comrades and residents of the city, you have greeted us as you would welcome your closest friends. We are your brothers, your sincerely loving brothers, and we express our deepest gratitude for such a warm and grand welcome.

The Chinese people have achieved revolutionary victory and established a new, truly people's country. Now, under the glorious leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, they are building a socialist society with redoubled enthusiasm.

Based on our experience in socialist construction, we know that establishing a strong heavy industry is the main condition for ensuring the development of the national economy, strengthening national defense, and improving the people's welfare. The Chinese government and the Communist Party are doing everything possible to build China into a strong and prosperous industrial country. Since liberation, China has established dozens of new heavy industrial enterprises, power stations, and mines, built thousands of kilometers of railways and highways, and continuously striven to innovate industrial technology.

Dear comrades of Anshan, in the struggle for China's industrialization, you are at the forefront of the struggle for China's industrialization. In a very short period, you have turned your city into China's large-scale iron and steel industrial base. Anshan is now, as you call it, China's "Steel Capital," and it is also China's pride and China's future.

We are very pleased to see that Anshan Iron and Steel Company, equipped with modern technology, produces more steel annually than twice the national steel production before liberation. Not only the people of the whole country know, but also the people of other countries know that the people of Anshan love their city and their enterprise, and they are contributing all their strength to the prosperity of the motherland and the happiness of the people.

The workers of Anshan Iron and Steel Plant have a high degree of patriotism and creative spirit in labor. The workers of Anshan have launched a mass movement to increase labor productivity and have achieved great success in this important issue. In your modern steelmaking plant, the time for smelting a furnace of steel has been shortened from twelve hours to seven hours, and the steelmaking worker Hu Liange has shortened the smelting time to four hours and fifty-three minutes, and has increased the steel output per square meter of furnace bottom to more than fifteen tons, exceeding the highest index of oxygen steelmaking.

There are many other names of Anshan workers that are also familiar to the Soviet people.

Dear comrades, please allow me to congratulate you on the achievements you have made in production on behalf of the Soviet people, and sincerely wish you new achievements in your work.

Your labor is of great significance. The more steel you produce for the country, the greater the contribution you make to the cause of transforming your country into a prosperous and strong industrial country.

Dear comrades, Anshan and the rapidly developing Anshan Iron and Steel Enterprise are a vivid embodiment of Sino-Soviet friendship. Here, Chinese workers, engineers, and technicians work side by side with their Soviet friends, who introduce the best experience of the Soviet steel industry to China. I think it can be said that Anshan is the most prominent result of the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples, a friendship forged in the fire of steelmaking furnaces—a friendship of workers. We sincerely hope that the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet workers, like the friendship between our two peoples, will continue to develop and strengthen.

Dear comrades, I would like to emphasize that the friendship between the peoples is by no means an accidental and temporary phenomenon. This is the path of development for all nations, this is the future of all mankind. If the people of all countries in the world can live in harmony and if they compete with each other in peaceful labor, then bloody wars will disappear forever, and the lives of people in all countries will become unprecedentedly prosperous and happy.

Socialist countries, which account for one-third of the world's population, are unswervingly pursuing a policy of friendship with the people of all countries.

This policy is supported by India, Indonesia, Egypt, Burma, Afghanistan, and many other Asian and African countries that are fighting against colonialism and for national independence and freedom. This noble movement is also supported by fair-minded people in Europe and the Americas.

It can be said without exaggeration that the solid friendship between the people of socialist countries and the friendly cooperation between peace-loving people of all countries in the world are one of the main forces preventing the imperialists from launching new wars.

Therefore, the imperialists and their accomplices are doing everything possible to undermine the friendship between the people of all countries, create divisions in the democratic and socialist camps, and incite nationalist and chauvinist sentiments.

However, as long as we continue to strengthen the friendship between the peace-loving, free, and independent Soviet Union, China, and all socialist countries, and the people of all countries in the world, then the bloody plans of the imperialist adventurers will surely be bankrupt.

Dear comrades, finally, please allow me to assure you that the Soviet people will continue to be the most reliable and faithful friends of the Chinese people.

May the friendship and close cooperation between the Soviet Union and the increasingly strong People's Republic of China continue to strengthen!

Long live the heroic Chinese working class!

Dear friends, I wish you good health and new victories in your work!

Long live the Chinese people!

Long live the Chinese Communist Party and its leader Comrade Mao Zedong!

### 伏罗希洛夫在鞍钢的讲话

    伏罗希洛夫在鞍钢的讲话亲爱的同志们：
    我们能来到这个著名的城市和你们会面，感到非常荣幸，请允许我向你们向鞍山市男女公民们、儿童们表示衷心的感谢，感谢你们对我们这样热情的、盛大的、兄弟般的欢迎，并向你们转达苏联劳动人民的来自内心的崇高的敬意。亲爱的同志们、城市的居民们，你们就像欢迎最亲密的朋友一样迎接了我们。我们是你们的亲兄弟，是你们真诚相爱的兄弟，我们对你们这样热烈的盛大的欢迎，表示我最深切的谢意。
    中国人民已经取得了革命胜利，建立了新的真正人民的国家。现在正在光荣的中国共产党的领导下，热情百倍地建设社会主义社会。
    根据我国社会主义建设的经验，我们知道建立强大的重工业是保证发展国民经济、增强国防力量和提高人民福利的主要条件。中国政府和共产党正在尽一切努力来把中国建成一个强大的、繁荣的工业国。解放以后，中国已经建立了数十个新的重工业企业、发电站、矿井，建设了几千公里的铁路和公路，工业技术也在不断地努力革新。
    亲爱的鞍山的同志们：在中国工业化的斗争中，你们走在为争取中国工业化斗争的前列。在很短的时期内，你们已经把你们的城市变成了中国大规模的钢铁工业基地。现在的鞍山正像你们称呼的那样是中国的“钢都”，同时它也是中国的骄傲，也是中国的未来。
    我们很高兴看到：用现代技术装备起来的鞍山钢铁公司每年出产的钢，相当于解放前全国钢的产量的两倍以上。不仅全国的人民知道，而且其他国家的人民也都知道鞍山的人民热爱自己的城市和自己的企业，他们正为祖国的富强和人民的幸福贡献出自己的全部力量。
    鞍山钢铁厂的工人们具有高度的爱国主义精神和劳动上的创造精神。鞍山的工人们掀起了提高劳动生产率的群众性运动，并且在这个重要的问题上取得了巨大的成就。在你们的具有现代化装备的炼钢厂里炼一炉钢的时间从十二小时缩短到七小时，而炼钢工人胡连阁已经把炼钢时间缩短到四小时五十三分钟，并且把每平方公尺炉底的出钢量提高到十五吨以上，超过了氧气炼钢的最高的指标。
    还有许多其他鞍山工人的名字也是为苏联人民所熟悉的。
    亲爱的同志们：请允许我代表苏联人民向你们在生产上取得的成就表示祝贺，并衷心地预祝你们在劳动中获得新的成就。
    你们的劳动具有巨大的意义。你们给国家多生产一些钢铁，也就是对于把你们的国家变成为富强的工业国的事业做出巨大的贡献。
    亲爱的同志们：鞍山和迅速发展的鞍山钢铁企业是中苏友谊的生动的体现。在这里中国的工人、工程师和技术人员同他们的苏联朋友们并肩劳动，这些苏联朋友把苏联钢铁工业的最好的经验介绍给中国。我想可以这样说：鞍山是最突出地表现中苏两国人民友谊的一个成果，这种友谊是炼钢炉的烈火炼出来的友谊——是工人的友谊，我们衷心地希望中苏两国工人的友谊正像我们两国人民的友谊一样，不断地发展和加强。
    亲爱的同志们：我想着重指出人民之间的友谊——这绝不是什么偶然的和暂时的现象，这是一切民族发展的道路，这是整个人类的未来。如果全世界一切国家的人民都能友好相处，如果他们都在和平劳动中互相竞赛，那么流血的战争将永远绝迹，各国人民的生活将变得空前繁荣和幸福。
    人口占全人类三分之一的社会主义国家在坚持不渝地执行各国人民的友好的政策。
    这个政策得到了为反对殖民主义、为争取民族独立和自由而斗争的印度、印度尼西亚、埃及、缅甸、阿富汗和许多其他亚非国家的支持。这个崇高的运动也得到欧洲和美洲公正人士的支持。
    可以毫不夸大地说，各社会主义国家的人民之间巩固的友谊，全世界各国爱好和平的人民之间的友好合作，是阻止帝国主义者发动新战争的主要的力量之一。
    因此，帝国主义者和它们的帮凶们就千方百计地破坏各国人民之间的友谊，在民主和社会主义阵营中制造分裂，煽起民族主义和沙文主义的情绪。
    但是，只要我们不断地加强爱好和平、自由和独立的苏联、中国和各个社会主义国家及全世界各国人民之间的友谊，那么帝国主义冒险家的血腥的计划就必定会遭到破产。
    亲爱的同志们：最后请允许我向你们保证苏联人民今后仍然是中国人民最可靠和忠实的朋友。
    祝苏联和日益强盛的中华人民共和国之间的友谊和亲密合作不断加强！
    英勇的中国工人阶级万岁！
    亲爱的朋友们：祝你们身体健康，祝你们在劳动中取得新的胜利！
    中国人民万岁！
    中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东同志万岁！
