Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 5th - President Sukarno announced to reporters last night that he had appointed himself as the formateur to organize an extra-parliamentary extraordinary cabinet. This cabinet would take correct and firm actions and would request the establishment of a national council according to the President's plan.

The President made the announcement after a meeting at the State Palace with approximately seventy political and public leaders.

The President said that the cabinet formation would proceed simultaneously in two ways. He would, in his capacity as formateur, invite qualified individuals to join the cabinet, and at the same time, in his capacity as President and Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, he would appoint qualified individuals to the cabinet under wartime and martial law conditions.

Sukarno announced that at this meeting, the majority of those invited to join the cabinet had accepted his request and appointment.

Among the approximately seventy prominent figures who participated in the meeting were the resigning Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo who remained in office, Indonesian Nationalist Party Chairman Suwirjo, Nahdlatul Ulama Chairman Chalid, Masjumi Party Chairman Natsir, Indonesian Communist Party General Secretary Aidit, Perti Islamic Party figure Abbas, Islamic Union Party Central Executive Committee Chairman Kartawinata, Nahdlatul Ulama First Vice Chairman Dahlan, and Professor Prijono, among others. The three chiefs of staff of the armed forces, the head of the national police, Attorney General Suprapto, and several senior military officers also attended the meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 5th - Today's editorial in the "Indonesian Torch" newspaper stated that the President's announcement of the establishment of an extraordinary cabinet was a decision made under wartime emergency conditions, and therefore every citizen cannot refuse the task entrusted by the head of state.

The newspaper said that although the cabinet will be organized by the President himself, it seems that the President does not think the time has come for him to lead the cabinet himself.

Indonesia's "People's Daily" said that the actions taken by the Supreme Commander last night were resolute and correct, demonstrating that the President truly recognizes the demands of the current situation. The newspaper said that the people welcome the President's decision, and they have no reason not to help the President's responsible efforts. The newspaper pointed out that organizing a 100% parliamentary cabinet would not be in line with the current extraordinary situation; if the President completely abandoned political parties and people's leaders, that would not be in line with democratic principles. The actions taken by the President now are in line with both democratic principles and adapt to the extraordinary situation.

The "Social Envoy" reported, despite some agreeing and some disagreeing, Sukarno's designation as formateur is a fait accompli. The newspaper believes that the President's desire to form a cabinet in the short term can be realized.

The Masjumi Party's organ, "Abadi Daily," said that although the country is currently under martial law, the President's measures still violate the constitution. The newspaper believes that this action is unnecessary because Suwirjo's two failed attempts to form a cabinet do not mean that the path to organizing a new cabinet according to constitutional procedures has been completely blocked.

    接见政界和公众领袖后
    苏加诺总统宣布亲自组织非常事务内阁
    许多报纸认为适应当前情况　马斯友美党报纸硬说不合宪法
    新华社雅加达5日电　苏加诺总统昨天晚上向记者们宣布：他已经任命他自己为组阁人来组织一个超议会的非常事务内阁。这个内阁会采取正确和坚定的行动，并且会要求按照总统的方案成立民族委员会。
    总统是在国家宫同大约七十名政界领袖和公众领袖举行了会议之后宣布这个消息的。
    总统说，组阁工作将按照两种办法同时进行。他将以组阁人的资格邀请称职的人参加内阁，同时他将以总统和武装部队最高统帅的资格在战争和戒严状态下指定称职的人入阁。
    苏加诺宣布：在这次会议上，大多数被邀请参加内阁的人已经接受他的请求和任命。
    在参加这次会议的约七十名知名人士中，有辞职留任的总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约、印度尼西亚国民党总主席苏维约、伊斯兰教师联合会主席查利德、马斯友美党主席纳席尔、印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地、白尔蒂伊斯兰党人阿巴斯、伊斯兰联盟党中央执行委员会主席卡塔威纳塔、伊斯兰教师联合会第一副主席达兰以及普里约诺教授等人。武装部队的三位参谋长、国家警察首长、检察总长苏普拉普托以及一些高级军官也参加了这次会议。
    新华社雅加达5日电　“印度尼西亚火炬报”今天的社论说，总统宣布成立非常内阁是在战时紧急状态下作出的决定，因此每个公民都不能拒绝元首所委托的任务。
    报纸说，虽然内阁将由总统自己来组织，看来总统认为还不到要自己领导内阁的时候。
    印度尼西亚“人民日报”说，最高统帅昨天晚上采取的行动是坚决的和正确的行动，这表明总统真正认识到目前情况的要求。报纸说，人民欢迎总统的决定，他们没有理由不帮助总统这种有责任感的努力。报纸指出，如果组织百分之百的议会内阁，是不符合目前的非常情况的；如果总统完全抛弃政党和人民领袖，那又不符合民主原则。现在总统所采取的行动既符合民主原则，也适应非常情况。
    “社会使者报”说，尽管有人赞成也有人反对，无论如何苏加诺被指定为组阁人已经是既成事实。报纸相信，总统在短期内组成内阁的愿望能够实现。
    马斯友美党机关报“永恒日报”说，目前虽然处在军事戒严令的情况下，总统的措施仍然违反了宪法。报纸认为，这种行动不必要。因为苏维约两次组阁失败并不说明根据符合宪法的程序来组织新阁的途径都已经堵绝。
