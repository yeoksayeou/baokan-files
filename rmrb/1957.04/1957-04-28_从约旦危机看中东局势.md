		A Look at the Middle East Situation from the Jordan Crisis
		Gu Si
    The events that have unfolded in Jordan over the past two weeks fully demonstrate the arduous and complex nature of the Middle Eastern people's anti-colonialist struggle, and also demonstrate the grave threat that the Eisenhower Doctrine poses to peace in the Middle East.

    As this newspaper has already pointed out, the Jordanian government crisis is not purely an internal problem. To a great extent, it represents a vicious counterattack by the colonialist bloc, led by the United States, against anti-colonialist forces in the Middle East following the failed Anglo-French-Israeli aggression against Egypt. They are attempting to use this offensive to divide the unity of the Arab countries, isolate Egypt and Syria, and firmly re-establish colonial rule in the Middle East.

                The Occurrence of the Jordan Crisis

    The crisis in Jordan began with the resignation of the Nabulsi cabinet on April 10. Prior to this, a long-standing struggle had been taking place within Jordan between pro-imperialist right-wing forces and patriotic forces that insisted on national independence. The right-wing forces advocated accepting the Eisenhower Doctrine and aligning with the Baghdad Pact, while the nationalist forces opposed their actions that harmed national independence and advocated a policy of peaceful neutrality and unity among free Arab countries. The right-wing forces received the support and encouragement of US and British imperialism. The United States deliberately created political and economic difficulties for the Nabulsi cabinet, suspending the Fourth Point Program and "aid" to Jordan, while further enticing the right-wing forces with "aid" from the Eisenhower Plan. The United States also hinted to the Jordanian right-wing forces that they should create "satisfactory" conditions for accepting American "aid." This explains why the eruption of the Jordan crisis occurred precisely when the Richards Mission, promoting the "Eisenhower Doctrine," was visiting Saudi Arabia, a neighboring country of Jordan.

              The Khalidi Cabinet

    However, the Jordanian right-wing forces underestimated the strength of the patriotic people. The resignation of the Nabulsi cabinet triggered a huge reaction domestically, especially in the region west of the Jordan River. The Jordanian people immediately recognized this as the first step in American imperialism's aggression against Jordan. They held meetings and demonstrations, demanding the reinstatement of the Nabulsi cabinet and opposing the acceptance of the Eisenhower Doctrine. Under these circumstances, several attempts to form a new cabinet failed. The imperialists and right-wing forces attempted to use the army to suppress the people, but there was also a strong patriotic force within the army. Patriotic senior officers such as Nuwar were unwilling to accept the tasks of purging patriotic officers from the army and suppressing the people, and successively defected to Syria.

    Under pressure from the Jordanian people, the right-wing forces had to temporarily retreat slightly to gain breathing room, and thus formed a cabinet headed by Khalidi, a centrist figure. This cabinet reflected a temporary compromise between the two forces. Former Prime Minister Nabulsi served as Foreign Minister in the new cabinet. In order to appease the people, the King and the cabinet declared that they would continue to pursue a neutral policy and unite with free Arab countries such as Egypt and Syria, but at the same time, they secretly continued to undermine the patriotic forces and cover up for American interference. This aroused the indignation of the patriotic Jordanian people, triggering a wave of large-scale demonstrations and general strikes across the country. Under these circumstances, the imperialists felt that this cabinet was not ideal and could not effectively serve their interests. Therefore, they actively interfered in Jordan's internal affairs, encouraging the right-wing forces to launch a further offensive against the patriotic forces, which led to the continued deterioration of the situation in Jordan.

                  American Interference

    American interference took place in many ways. American diplomatic personnel in Jordan openly engaged in activities to buy off right-wing politicians and army officers, and supported the right-wing forces in purging the army, making it an assistant in suppressing patriotic forces. At the same time, Eisenhower, Dulles, and others repeatedly made statements supporting and encouraging the right-wing forces to take action against the people. The United States also directed Israel, Iraq, and others to station troops on the Jordanian border in support of the right-wing forces. This frantic preparation by the imperialists and the Jordanian right-wing forces naturally met with even more resolute opposition from the Jordanian people. By the 24th of this month, the American imperialists and right-wing forces were ready and immediately launched an attack on the patriotic forces. The Khalidi cabinet was forced to resign, and the pro-Western Hashim cabinet was subsequently formed. With the support of the US Sixth Fleet's "show of force," the Hashim cabinet began a large-scale suppression of patriotic forces in Jordan.

    However, the patriotic nationalist forces in Jordan are still quite strong, and it remains very difficult for the right-wing forces to act arbitrarily against the will of the people. King Hussein's declaration after the Hashim cabinet came to power that he himself had always opposed the Richards Mission's visit to Jordan proves this point. The struggle between the two forces within Jordan will undoubtedly continue.

              The Basic Contradiction in the Middle East Region

    The political crisis in Jordan highlights the fact that the basic contradiction in the Middle East region at present is the contradiction between the imperialist colonial forces, led by the United States, and the anti-colonialist nationalist forces. The Jordan incident is the first concrete action by the United States in the Middle East to implement the so-called "filling the vacuum" Eisenhower Doctrine. It is part of the entire American conspiracy to invade the Middle East and suppress the Arab national independence movement.

    After the failure of the Anglo-French-Israeli aggression against Egypt, the United States, under the banner of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," attempted to replace Britain and France in the Middle East. For the United States, the primary task is to undermine the prestige and influence of Egypt and Syria in the Arab world. To strike at the independence of Egypt and Syria is to strike at the entire Arab people's struggle for independence; to undermine the prestige and influence of Egypt and Syria in the Arab world is to bring all Arab countries under its control. Therefore, the United States, on the one hand, participated in the Baghdad Pact Military Committee, dispatched the Richards Mission to encourage countries that followed the West, and on the other hand, exerted various pressures on Egypt and Syria, attempting to force them to submit.

    Despite this, they remained unyielding. Even on the Suez Canal issue, the United States exhausted its schemes but failed to make Egypt give up its sovereignty. Moreover, the neutral tendency in Jordan was developing, and if Jordan formed a federation with Egypt and Syria, connecting them into one piece, they would be better able to support each other and resist imperialist pressure. The implementation of the Eisenhower Doctrine's aggressive plan would face greater difficulties. The United States therefore chose Jordan, a weak but important link, launched an offensive, attempting to bring Jordan into the net of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," thereby isolating Egypt and Syria.

        Contradictions within the Imperialist Bloc

    The new American expansion in the Middle East also intensified the contradictions within the imperialist bloc. Although Britain helplessly acknowledged the United States' leadership in the aggression against the Middle East and was consistent with the United States in dealing with nationalist forces, it was unwilling to be completely squeezed out of the Middle East. The United States' participation in the Baghdad Pact Military Committee could certainly stabilize this almost collapsing group, but Britain's influence was greatly squeezed out, which Britain was unwilling to do. Iraq has always been a sphere of British influence. The Richards Mission got along very well with the Iraqi ruling group and promised to give Iraq additional military and economic assistance. Shortly after Richards left, Britain notified Iraq that it would assist Iraq in expanding its armaments and immediately sent several jet fighters. Richards' visit to Yemen was also warned by Britain. There are indications that Britain is now taking some measures to restore the influence it lost due to the aggression against Egypt in order to ensure its remaining interests in the Middle East. There is a Chinese saying: "The protruding rafter rots first." It seems that Britain is watching with schadenfreude as the Eisenhower Doctrine, like a bull in a china shop, makes trouble everywhere in the Middle East and becomes a "protruding rafter."

    The situation in Jordan shows that the struggle of the Middle Eastern people against imperialism is long-term and arduous. In order to plunder the Middle East's oil, control this strategic hub, and further expand into Africa, American imperialism is bound to use various despicable and shameless means, including armed intervention and political subversion, to suppress the Middle Eastern people's struggle for independence. However, the Middle Eastern people have experience in fighting imperialism, and they have the support of reliable friends all over the world. Although their struggle may suffer temporary setbacks, the trend of history cannot be stopped by anyone.

    从约旦危机看中东局势
    顾思
    过去两个多星期中在约旦发生的事件，充分说明了中东人民反殖民主义斗争的艰苦性和复杂性，同时也说明了艾森豪威尔主义对中东和平的严重威胁。
    正如本报已经指出过的，约旦的政府危机并不纯粹是内部的问题，在更大的程度上，是在英、法、以色列侵略埃及失败以后，以美国为首的殖民主义集团对中东的反殖民主义力量的一次凶恶的反扑。它们企图用这次进攻来分裂阿拉伯国家的团结，孤立埃及和叙利亚，重新牢固地在中东树立殖民统治。
                约旦危机的发生
    约旦的危机是在4月10日以纳布西内阁辞职开始的。在这以前，约旦国内亲帝国主义的右翼势力同坚持民族独立的爱国力量之间，长期以来就在进行着斗争。右翼势力主张接受艾森豪威尔主义、靠拢巴格达条约集团，而民族主义的力量则反对它们危害民族独立的作法，主张奉行和平中立和团结自由阿拉伯国家的政策。右翼势力得到了美、英帝国主义的支持和鼓励。美国故意给纳布西内阁制造政治上、经济上的困难，停止在约旦的第四点计划和给予约旦的“援助”，同时以艾森豪威尔计划中的“援助”进一步引诱右翼势力。美国并且暗示约旦右翼势力应当为接受美国的“援助”创造“令人满意”的条件。这也就是为什么约旦危机的爆发，正是在推销“艾森豪威尔主义”的理查兹代表团到约旦的邻国沙特阿拉伯访问的时候。
              哈利迪内阁
    可是约旦的右翼势力过低估计了爱国人民的力量。纳布西内阁的辞职，在国内、特别是约旦河以西地区引起了巨大的反响。约旦人民立刻看出了这是美帝国主义侵略约旦的第一步。他们纷纷举行集会和示威，要求纳布西内阁复职，反对接受艾森豪威尔主义。在这种情况下，好几次组织新内阁的尝试都失败了。帝国主义和右翼势力曾经企图利用军队来镇压人民，但是军队内部同样存在强大的爱国力量。爱国的高级军官诺瓦尔等，不愿意接受清洗军队中的爱国军官、镇压人民的任务，先后出走到叙利亚。
    在约旦人民的压力下面，右翼势力不能不暂时稍为后退一步，争取喘息时间，因而组成了以中间人士哈利迪为首相的内阁。这个内阁反映了两种力量之间的暂时妥协。前首相纳布西在新内阁中担任了外交大臣的职务。为了安抚人民，国王和内阁都宣布仍将奉行中立政策，团结埃及、叙利亚等自由阿拉伯国家，但是同时又暗中继续摧残爱国力量，并替美国的干涉行为进行掩护。这就激起了约旦爱国人民的愤慨，在全国各地掀起了大示威和总罢工的浪潮。在这种情况下，帝国主义者们觉得这个内阁不够理想，不能有效地为它们的利益服务，因而积极干涉约旦内政，鼓动右翼势力进一步发动对爱国力量的进攻，这就导致了约旦局势的继续恶化。
                  美国进行干涉
    美国的干涉是从多方面进行的。美国驻约旦的外交人员公开进行了收买右翼政客和陆军军官的活动，并且支持右翼势力清洗陆军，使陆军成为镇压爱国力量的助手。同时，艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯等一再发表谈话，支持和鼓励右翼势力向人民动手。美国还指使以色列、伊拉克等驻兵约旦边境，声援右翼势力。帝国主义和约旦右翼势力的这种疯狂的准备工作，自然遭到了约旦人民的更坚决的反对。到本月24日，美帝国主义和右翼势力准备妥当，立即向爱国力量开刀。哈利迪内阁被迫辞职，亲西方的哈希姆内阁随即组成。在美国第六舰队“炫耀武力”的支持之下，哈希姆内阁开始了对约旦爱国力量的大规模镇压。
    但是约旦的爱国的民族主义力量还是相当强大的，右翼势力要想不顾人民意志蛮干到底，仍然是非常困难的。侯赛因国王在哈希姆内阁上台以后，宣称他本人一直反对理查兹代表团访问约旦，就证明了这一点。约旦内部两种力量的斗争，无疑还将继续下去。
              中东地区的基本矛盾
    约旦的政治危机突出地说明了这样一个事实：目前中东地区的基本矛盾，是以美国为首的帝国主义殖民势力同反殖民主义的民族主义力量之间的矛盾。约旦事件是美国在中东把所谓“填补真空”的“艾森豪威尔主义”付诸实施的第一个具体行动。它是美国侵略中东、镇压阿拉伯民族独立运动的整个阴谋的一部分。
    在英、法、以色列侵略埃及失败之后，美国就打着“艾森豪威尔主义”的旗帜，企图取代英法在中东的地位。对于美国来说，打击埃及和叙利亚在阿拉伯世界中的威信和影响，是首要的任务。打击了坚持独立的埃及和叙利亚，也就是打击了整个阿拉伯人民争取独立的斗争；打击了埃及和叙利亚在阿拉伯世界中的威信和影响，就可以把所有阿拉伯国家都控制在自己手里。因此，美国一方面参加巴格达条约军事委员会，派出理查兹代表团，给追随西方的国家打气，一方面对埃及和叙利亚施加种种压力，企图迫使它们屈服。
    尽管如此，它们却仍然坚持不屈。就是在苏伊士运河问题上，美国用尽计谋，也未能使埃及放弃主权。而且，约旦的中立趋向日益发展，如果约旦同埃及、叙利亚结成联邦，连成一片，它们就能更好地互相声援，抵抗帝国主义的压力。“艾森豪威尔主义”侵略计划的推行，就将遭受更大的困难。美国因此选择了约旦这个薄弱的然而又是重要的一环，发动了进攻，企图把约旦拉进“艾森豪威尔主义”的网罗，从而使埃及和叙利亚陷于孤立的地位。
        帝国主义集团内部的矛盾
    美国在中东的新扩张，同时也使帝国主义集团内部的矛盾更加尖锐化起来。英国虽然无可奈何地承认了美国在侵略中东方面的领导权，在对付民族主义力量方面同美国一致，但是它并不甘心于自己被完全排挤出中东。美国参加巴格达条约军事委员会，固然可以稳定这个几乎要垮台的集团，可是英国的势力却大受排挤，这是英国所不愿意的。伊拉克一向是英国的势力范围。理查兹代表团同伊拉克统治集团打得火热，答应给伊拉克额外的军事和经济援助。在理查兹走后不久，英国就通知伊拉克，表示要协助伊拉克扩充军备，并且立即送去喷气式飞机数架。理查兹访问也门，也受到了英国的警告。有迹象表明，英国现在正在采取一些措施，挽回由于侵略埃及而丧失的影响，以便确保自己在中东地区的残存利益。中国有句俗语说：“出头的椽子先烂。”看来英国正在带着幸灾乐祸的心情，让艾森豪威尔主义像闯进磁器店的牛一样，在中东到处闯祸成为“出头的椽子”。
    约旦的局势说明，中东人民反对帝国主义的斗争是长期的、艰苦的。美帝国主义为了掠夺中东的石油，控制这个战略枢纽，并进一步向非洲扩张，势必要用各种卑鄙无耻的手段，包括武装干涉和政治颠复在内，来镇压中东人民争取独立的斗争。但是中东人民已经有了同帝国主义作斗争的经验，他们在全世界有着可靠的朋友的支持。尽管他们的斗争有可能受到暂时的挫折，但是历史的趋向是谁也阻挡不了的。
