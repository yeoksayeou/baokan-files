Xinhua News Agency, April 3rd: To promote and support the development of live pig production, the state will allocate 100 million yuan between April and December this year to pre-purchase 15 million head of live pigs. The pre-purchase areas include 22 provinces such as Hebei, Liaoning, Jiangsu, Henan, Shandong, Hunan, and Sichuan, as well as the three major cities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. The Ministry of Urban Services and the People's Bank of China recently jointly issued a notice regarding the pre-purchase of live pigs.

    The notice stipulates that the regions carrying out cash pre-purchases of live pigs this year should focus on cities, industrial and mining areas, forestry areas, and live pig production bases supplying exports, while appropriately taking into account disaster areas and general production areas. The targets of the pre-purchase are mainly farming households of members and individual farmers with difficulties in raising pigs, and appropriately taking care of agricultural production cooperatives that have genuine difficulties in raising pigs collectively. In order to stimulate farmers to raise more fat pigs, all live pigs that can be fattened and sold in the current year can be pre-purchased, except for boars, sows, and dairy pigs. The deposit issued by the state for each pre-purchased live pig varies from 6 yuan to 12 yuan depending on the size of the pig farmer's difficulties, and it is stipulated that this amount will be deducted without interest when the fat pigs are delivered for sale.

    The joint notice also requires service departments, the People's Bank of China, and relevant departments in various regions to quickly combine local conditions and coordinate plans under the unified leadership of party and government at all levels, specifically assigning the pre-purchase of live pigs tasks and cash allocation targets to subordinate units. It is stipulated that pre-purchase funds must be used specifically for designated purposes and allocated on time and in the correct amount locally. At the same time, the Ministry of Urban Services also requires all regions to widely publicize the pre-purchase policy to cadres and the masses at the beginning of the pre-purchase work and sign pre-purchase contracts directly with pig farmers (cooperatives) by local food companies or commissioned supply and marketing cooperatives in accordance with the principle of voluntariness. It is forbidden to adopt simplistic and erroneous practices such as mandatory allocation, paternalistic arrangements, registering households one by one, or drawing lots. Attention should also be paid to preventing unreasonable phenomena such as false reporting, reporting less as more, and misappropriation of deposits in the pre-purchase of live pigs.

    国家今年将预购生猪一千五百万头
    新华社3日讯　为促进与扶助生猪生产的发展，国家在今年4月至12月间将拨出一亿元，预购生猪一千五百万头。预购的地区是在河北、辽宁、江苏、河南、山东、湖南、四川等二十二个省和北京、天津、上海三大城市以及内蒙古自治区和新疆维吾尔自治区。城市服务部和中国人民银行最近已联合发出关于预购生猪的通知。
    通知中规定今年开展现金预购生猪的地区，主要是以城市、工矿林区和供应出口的生猪生产基地为重点，适当照顾灾区和一般产区。预购的对象，是以社员家庭和个体农民养猪的困难户为主，适当照顾确有困难的集体养猪的农业生产合作社。为了刺激农民多养肥猪，除公、母种猪和奶猪外，凡是在当年可以育肥交售的生猪均可预购。国家预购生猪每头发放的定金，按照养猪户的困难大小，分别给予六元至十二元不等，并且规定在交售肥猪时无息扣还。
    联合通知还要求各地服务部门、人民银行和有关部门，在各级党政统一领导下，从速结合本地情况、衔接好计划，将预购生猪任务和现金投放指标，具体分配到所属单位，并且规定预购资金专款专用，按期、按数就地拨付。同时城市服务部还要求各地在预购工作的开始时，广泛地向干部和群众进行预购政策的宣传教育，并且按照自愿的原则，由当地食品公司或委托供销合作社直接与养猪户（社）签订预购合同。反对采取硬性摊派、包办代替、挨户登记或是抽签等简单化的错误作法，并且应该注意和防止预购生猪中发生虚报冒领、以少报多以及挪用定金等不合理现象。
