A: You're going to have a Hundred Flowers blooming there too, right?
B: Yeah! Looks like we can't avoid it! What about your place?
A: We've already started.
B: You're really on top of things! Tell me, how did you start?
A: Couldn't avoid starting, but didn't have the confidence to go big, so we had to start small.
B: Right! Like "grass color seen from afar, but not up close," just a little bit will do! How did you do it small?
A: First, we held a small forum, blowing a bit of air without getting too close or too far.
B: Good idea! How did the meeting go?
A: Well... not ideal!
B: Did something go wrong?
A: You remember that old man Zhang from our place?
B: Is that Zhang Biegu? What about him?
A: That's the one! I didn't think it through enough, I invited him to the forum! Guess what he said?
B: It's got to be some crazy talk!
A: Crazier than crazy! He said, the Confucian and Mencian way is the foundation of the nation, and we should replace Marxism-Leninism with the Four Books and Five Classics!
B: He said that?
A: Am I the one saying it? I knew all along that letting a hundred flowers bloom would inevitably lead to chaos!
B: You just listened to him spout nonsense?
A: Of course not! I stopped him from speaking!
B: Right! Right!
A: Right? I got criticized!
B: Zhang Biegu certainly deserves criticism!
A: Me, not him, I got criticized!
B: You? Strange!
A: Exactly! The Hundred Flowers Campaign has let loose all sorts of weird things, the world is going to be in chaos! You wait and see! You know, the higher-ups called me in and gave me a good scolding! I said, aren't I letting them bloom here? The leader said: You're not letting people speak, what are you letting bloom? I, I'm completely confused! You see, during the "Suppression of Counter-revolutionaries," I wouldn't dare say I had merit, but I had no fault either. How, how come now I've encountered the Hundred Flowers Campaign, and I'm so confused? I can't figure it out?
B: Tough!
A: Tough! Really tough! Just watch, the Hundred Flowers Campaign is going to ruin loyal people like us!
B: Don't be so pessimistic, old friend! I have an idea for you: you go and advise Zhang Biegu to make a self-criticism, self-release and self-collect, wouldn't that prove you made no mistake?
A: Right, that's a good idea!

    小相声
    老舍
    甲：您那里也要搞百花齐放吧？
    乙：嗯！看样子，大概不搞不行了！您那里怎样呢？
    甲：已经动了手。
    乙：您真抓得紧！告诉告诉我，您怎么动的手？
    甲：不动不行，大动又没有把握，只好小来着。
    乙：对呀！草色遥看近却无嘛，有那么一点就行！您的小来着是怎么办的？
    甲：先开个小座谈会儿，不即不离地吹一吹。
    乙：好办法！会开得还好吧？
    甲：嗯——不理想！
    乙：出了岔子吗？
    甲：您记得我们那里的那个张老头子？
    乙：是那个张别古吗？他怎么样？
    甲：就是他！我考虑得不够，请了他参加座谈！您猜他说了什么？
    乙：反正是怪话！
    甲：怪得出奇！他说，孔孟之道是立国之本，应当以四书五经代替马列主义！
    乙：这是他说的？
    甲：难道是我说的吗？我早就想到，百花齐放非放乱了不可！
    乙：您就听着他信口开河吗？
    甲：当然不能！我制止了他的发言！
    乙：对！对！
    甲：对？受了批评喽！
    乙：张别古当然得受批评！
    甲：我，不是他，受了批评！
    乙：您？怪呀！
    甲：就是！百花齐放把什么怪事都放出来了，天下非大乱不可！您等着瞧吧！您看，上级把我叫了去，好教训了我一顿！我说，我不是在这儿放哪吗？首长说：您不准人家发言，放什么呀？我，我简直地完全胡涂了！您看，在搞“肃反”的时候，我不敢说有功，可也无过。怎么，怎么现在遇上百花齐放，我倒胡涂了呢？摸不清楚了呢？
    乙：难哪！
    甲：难！真难！看着吧，百花齐放非把咱们这样忠心耿耿的人搞垮了不可！
    乙：别太悲观，老朋友！我给您出个主意：您去劝告劝告张别古，叫他作个检讨，自放自收，不就证明您没有错误吗？
    甲：对，这倒是个好办法！
