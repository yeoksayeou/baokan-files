This is No Longer a Wild, Boundless Prairie
Ten years is a short period in the long history of the Mongolian people; however, what great changes have taken place in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region during these ten years!
By our reporter Lin Mo

    “The Song of the Charioteers,
     Under the Yin Mountains,
    The sky is like a yurt covering the plains.
    The sky is vast,
    The plains are boundless,
    The wind blows the grass low to reveal cattle and sheep.”

Perhaps many people still have a deep impression of this ancient folk song that has been passed down from the sixth century (Northern Qi Dynasty)! However, the area under the Yin Mountains referred to in "The Song of the Charioteers" is no longer a boundless prairie! It is planted with endless wheat, sugar beets, and various crops, and has modern sugar factories. Hohhot and Baotou are two cities with 300,000 to 400,000 people each, and Baotou is building a large iron and steel industrial base. The area under the Yin Mountains will no longer be a place where "the wind blows the grass low to reveal cattle and sheep," but will be a place where chimneys stand in forests, revealing factories.

The times are different, and the face of the land and the lives of the people have undergone great changes.

The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region covers an area of more than 1.4 million square kilometers, which is about one-seventh of our great motherland. It has a population of more than 8.7 million. The area is vast, and it produces many things, with different natural landscapes. There are rich pastures, large forests, fertile farmland, salt seas, fish lakes, and hundreds of factories of all sizes.

The Greater Khingan Range forest area covers 90,000 square kilometers, almost the size of Zhejiang Province. There, densely grow white birch and larch trees tens of feet tall. Now, hundreds of kilometers of railways have been built in the forest, with several towns of tens of thousands of people.

The Hetao Plain in western Inner Mongolia is a famous irrigation area in our country, with crisscrossing ditches and canals, irrigating more than 4 million mu of farmland with water from the Yellow River, most of which is planted with wheat. The Xiliao River and Xinkai River basins in the east and the surrounding areas of the Greater Khingan Range are fertile black soil areas, rich in soybeans and sorghum. About 75% of the population of Inner Mongolia is engaged in agriculture. In 1956, the average output per agricultural worker in the region was 1,350 jin, almost twice the national average. In recent years, Inner Mongolia has supplied a large amount of marketable grain to the whole country every year, and its amount ranks in the top three or four among all provinces and autonomous regions in the country.

The Mongolian people have rich experience in animal husbandry. More than 300,000 people are entirely engaged in animal husbandry, accounting for about 3.5% of the region's population, but the grassland pastoral areas account for 60% of the autonomous region's area. In the agricultural and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia, a large number of livestock are also raised. According to statistics in 1956, there were more than 26 million head of various livestock in the region (including more than 1.6 million pigs), which is about one-tenth of the total number of livestock in the country. Every year, a lot of fur, wool, dairy and meat products are supplied to the whole country.

The scenery of the grassland pastoral areas is also different from the past. Most banners (a banner is an administrative division at the county level) are accessible by car. The locations of the people's committees of each banner have gradually become the center of the political, economic, and cultural life of the entire banner. In the past, herders often had to travel hundreds of miles for trading, but now the supply and marketing network of cooperatives covers the grasslands, with an average of one supply and marketing point for every 500 people.

The individual and scattered management of animal husbandry is moving towards cooperation. The vast majority of herders have joined mutual aid teams, and more than 20% of herders have joined cooperatives. There are thousands of horse-drawn mowers on the grasslands. Forty state-owned farms have been established throughout the region. Along some railway lines, forty or so dairy factories have been established, some of which are equipped with modern machines and have a larger scale, using the abundant milk produced in the pastoral areas to mass-produce milk powder, butter, casein, and lactose.

The autonomous region has vast land and abundant natural resources that need to be further developed and utilized. The carrying capacity of the grasslands can be increased several times. There are tens of millions of mu of wasteland that can be reclaimed. The prospects for industrial development are unlimited. A large amount of iron, coal, and certain precious rare metals are being developed in a planned way.

Thousands of years ago, the Mongolian people were many nomadic and hunting tribes living on the northern grasslands. After Genghis Khan unified the Mongolian tribes in the early 13th century, they became known to the world as a heroic and strong nation. However, for nearly 300 years, the oppression of foreign nations and the invasion of imperialism, combined with the internal reactionary classes, formed a divided rule over the Inner Mongolian people. Historians describe this situation as: one big mountain plus another big mountain on the Mongolian people; economically, they were bound by layers of feudal exploitation and the usurious network of colonialism, unable to move.

On the eve of liberation, Inner Mongolia, where the Mongolian people had lived and developed for a long time, could no longer be found on the map of old China! It was divided into pieces and assigned to various provinces such as Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan by the Kuomintang reactionary rulers.

When the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was established, history left it with a picture of poverty and misery. In the grassland pastoral areas, the livestock on which the people depended for survival were no longer numerous. Serious diseases were rampant, there were no doctors, and the population showed a sharp decline. The Mongolian people had no their own commerce, modern industry was hardly worth mentioning, and even independently producing handicraftsmen of the ethnic group were rare in the pastoral areas. In agricultural areas, cultivation techniques were mostly rough. Although the Mongolian people created their own phonetic script as early as 700 years ago—a script that is easier to learn and master than the Chinese characters—only one in a hundred people were literate; books and publications in their own language were extremely scarce. All this was because in the past, people only exploited and plundered the Mongolian people, and no one carried out construction.

It has been ten years since the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on May 1, 1947. Ten years is a short period in the long history of the Mongolian people, but it has been ten years of great change.

In the past, the Mongolian people carried out many struggles to resist imperialist aggression, foreign national oppression, and internal reactionary feudal rule, but none of them achieved their goals. After liberation, according to the Chinese Communist Party's national policy of equality, unity, mutual assistance, and common development for all ethnic groups in the country, regional autonomy was realized, and the right to be masters of their own affairs was obtained.

After the Mongolian people became masters of their own affairs, they restored and developed production and improved people's lives on the one hand, and carried out necessary social reforms on the other. Land reform was carried out in agricultural areas; democratic reform was carried out from top to bottom in pastoral areas, abolishing feudal privileges, liberating slaves, implementing free grazing and policies that benefited both herdsmen and owners, and not dividing classes or carrying out struggles in pastoral areas. These policies were conducive to the development of production, thereby changing the feudal relations within the ethnic group, liberating productive forces, and further strengthening the unity within the ethnic group and among the various ethnic groups in the region.

The socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce in Inner Mongolia has also been successfully completed. Socialist ownership has gained an absolute advantage.

With the implementation of the country's first Five-Year Plan, the autonomous region also began planned economic construction, and various economic and cultural undertakings are flourishing. In addition to the major engineering construction carried out directly by the state in Inner Mongolia, the autonomous region's investment in various capital construction projects during the first Five-Year Plan was equivalent to about 10 million taels of gold, something that had never happened in the history of the Mongolian people.

In the ten years since the establishment of the autonomous region, 1,100 kilometers of railways and more than 9,000 kilometers of highways have been newly built. Industrial production has increased twelvefold. The total number of livestock in the region has increased 2.2 times, and grain output has increased 1.5 times.

There are now more than 9,400 large, medium, and small schools throughout the region, with a total of 930,000 students. The number of students from the Mongolian and other ethnic minorities has increased tenfold compared with the early days of liberation.

The use of ethnic languages has also greatly developed. In 1956, there were six Mongolian newspapers published, with a total of 2.44 million copies. A total of 8.81 million copies of various Mongolian books, magazines, textbooks, and literacy primers were published.

The autonomous region has 23 large hospitals and sanatoriums. Health clinics have been established in all banners and counties. The number of medical staff has increased 23 times compared with the early days of liberation. The people's medical and health conditions have been greatly improved. The population of various ethnic minorities in the region has changed from declining to rising. The Mongolian population has increased by about 20% in ten years.

These simple figures have rich content for the lives of the Mongolian people, and they have changed the face of a nation. (Attached picture)

    这里已不再是野茫茫的草原
    十年，对蒙古民族长久的历史来说是一个短暂的时期；但是，在这十年之间，内蒙古自治区起了多么伟大的变化！本报记者　林　沫
    “敕勒歌，
     阴山下，
    天似穹庐盖四野。
    天苍苍，
    野茫茫，
    风吹草低见牛羊。”
    从六世纪（北齐时代）流传下来的这首古民歌，可能很多人还留有深刻的印象吧！可是，
  “敕勒歌”所指的阴山下，早已不是茫茫草原了！这里种植着一望无际的小麦、甜菜和各种农作物，有了现代化的制糖工厂。呼和浩特、包头是两个各有三、四十万人口的城市，包头正在建立一个很大的钢铁工业基地。阴山下已不再是“风吹草低见牛羊”，而将是烟囱林立见工厂了。
    时代不同了，土地的面貌和人民的生活有了很大的变化。
    内蒙古自治区的面积有一百四十余万平方公里，约等于我们伟大祖国的七分之一。人口八百七十多万。地方很大，出产的东西很多，自然风光也各有不同。这里有丰美的牧场，有大森林，有肥沃的农田，有盐海、鱼湖，还有大小几百个工厂。
    大兴安岭林区的面积有九万平方公里，差不多有浙江省那么大。那里密密地生长着几十尺高的白桦树和落叶松。现在森林里修了几百公里的铁路，有好几个万人的城镇。
    内蒙古西部河套平原是我国著名的灌溉区，那里沟渠纵横，用黄河水浇灌着四百多万亩农田，绝大部分种植着小麦。东部的西辽河、新开河流域和大兴安岭周围则是黑土沃野，盛产大豆、高粱。内蒙古全区75％左右的人口从事农业，1956年全区每个农业人口的平均产量是一千三百五十斤，差不多高于全国平均数的一倍。近几年，内蒙古每年都以大量的商品粮外调供应全国，其数目之多，在全国各省和自治区中被列在前三、四位。
    蒙古民族经营畜牧业有丰富的经验。有三十多万人完全从事畜牧业，约占全区人口的3.5％，但草原牧区却占自治区面积的60％。在内蒙古的农业区和半农半牧区也养有较多的牲畜。据1956年统计，全区有各种牲畜二千六百多万头（包括猪一百六十多万口），约等于全国牲畜数目的十分之一。每年有很多皮毛和乳、肉产品供应全国。
    草原牧区的景色也和过去不同了。绝大多数的旗（旗是县一级的行政区划）都可以通行汽车。各旗人民委员会所在地已逐渐形成为全旗人民政治和经济文化生活的中心。过去牧民为交易往往要跑几百里，现在合作社的供销网遍布草原，平均每五百人就有一个供销点。
    个体分散经营的畜牧业正在走向合作化，绝大多数牧民参加了互助组，20％多的牧民加入了合作社。草原上有了上千架的马拉打草机。全区已经建立了四十个国营牧场。在一些铁路沿线，建立了四十来个乳品工厂，其中有几处备有新式的机器和较大的规模，利用牧区出产的丰富的牛奶，大量制造奶粉、黄油、酪胶和乳糖。
    自治区有广大的土地和丰富的自然资源有待于进一步开发和利用。草原的载畜量还可以几倍地增加。有千万亩的荒地可以开垦。工业发展的前景更是不可限量，大量的铁、煤和某些贵重的稀有金属正在有计划地开发。
    蒙古民族在几千年以前是生活在北方草原上的许多游牧和狩猎的部落。在十三世纪初叶成吉思汗统一蒙古各部以后，就以一个英勇强悍的民族著称于世。但是近三百多年来，外来民族的压迫、帝国主义的侵略结合着内部的反动阶级形成对内蒙古民族的分割统治。历史学家描述这种状况是：在蒙古人民身上一座大山加一座大山；在经济上则是被层层的封建剥削和殖民主义者的高利贷网束缚得动弹不得。
    到解放前夕，蒙古族人民长期在这里生存发展的内蒙古，在旧中国的地图上已经找不到它了！它被国民党反动统治者四分五裂地划归到热河、察哈尔、绥远等各个行省。
    内蒙古自治区成立的时候，历史给它遗留下来的是一幅贫困、悲惨的图画。在草原牧区，人民赖以生存的牲畜已经不多了。严重的疾病到处流行，没有医生，人口呈现急剧下降的趋势。蒙古民族没有自己的商业，现代工业几乎谈不上，在牧区连本民族独立生产的手工业者也是稀有的。农业地区，耕作技术大多很粗放。虽然早在七百年前蒙古民族就创立了自己的拚音文字——这种文字较汉族的方块字要容易学习和掌握，但识字的人却百不抽一；本民族的书籍和出版物更是奇缺。这一切都因为过去只有人向蒙古人民进行剥削和掠夺，而没有人去进行建设。
    从1947年5月1日内蒙古自治区成立到现在已经十年了。十年，对蒙古民族长久的历史来说是一个短暂的时期，但这却是有伟大变化的十年。
    过去蒙古民族为反抗帝国主义的侵略、外来的民族压迫和内部反动的封建统治，曾进行过多次的斗争，但都没有达到目的。解放后，根据中国共产党对国内各民族实行平等、团结、互助和共同发展的民族政策，实现了区域自治，取得了当家作主的权利。
    蒙古民族当家作主之后，一面恢复与发展生产，改善人民生活，一面进行了必要的社会改革。在农业区进行了土地改革；在牧业区自上而下地进行了民主改革，取消了封建特权，解放了奴隶，实行了自由放牧和牧工、牧主两利以及在牧区不划阶级、不斗不分等项有利于发展生产的政策，从而改变了民族内部的封建关系，解放了生产力，进一步加强了民族内部和区内各民族之间的团结。
    内蒙古的农业、手工业和资本主义工商业也已顺利地完成了社会主义改造。社会主义所有制已经取得了绝对的优势。
    随着国家第一个五年计划的进行，自治区也开始了有计划的经济建设，各项经济文化事业蓬勃发展。除开国家直接在内蒙古进行的重大工程建设以外，自治区在第一个五年计划期间用于各项基本建设的投资约合黄金一千万两，这是蒙古民族历史上从来没有的事。
    在自治区成立后的十年中，新修了一千一百公里的铁路和九千多公里的公路。工业生产增加了十二倍。全区牲畜总头数增加了二点二倍，粮食产量增加了一点五倍。
    现全区共有大、中、小学九千四百多所，学生总数九十三万。蒙古族和其他少数民族的学生较解放初期增加了十倍。
    民族语文的使用也有很大发展，1956年出版的蒙文报纸有六种，共二百四十四万份。各种蒙文图书、杂志、教科书及扫盲课本共八百八十一万册。
    自治区现有二十三座较大的医院和疗养院，各旗、县普遍设立了卫生所，医务工作人员较解放初期增加了二十三倍。人民的医疗卫生条件有了很大改善，区内各少数民族的人口由下降改为上升，蒙古族人口十年中约增加了20％。
　　这些简单的数字对蒙古人民的生活具有丰富的内容，它改变了一个民族的面貌。（附图片）
