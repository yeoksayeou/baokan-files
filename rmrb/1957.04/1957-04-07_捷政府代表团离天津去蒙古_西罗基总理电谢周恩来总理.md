Dear Comrade:

The Czechoslovak government delegation spent many unforgettable days in China. As I now leave your great and beautiful country, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to you, and through you, to the government of the People's Republic of China and all the Chinese people, for the extremely warm reception you have given us during the delegation's visit to the People's Republic of China.

The Czechoslovak government delegation leaves fraternal People's Republic of China with rich and profound impressions and with extreme joy, seeing that the Chinese people are closely united around the Communist Party of China and the government of the People's Republic of China, and are perseveringly striving to build their motherland into a strong socialist country.

Dear Comrade, on behalf of all members of the Czechoslovak government delegation and in my own name, I would like to extend to you my warm wishes for good health and for new achievements in building socialism in your great and beautiful country.

Viliam Široký
