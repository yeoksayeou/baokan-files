    At 4:30 PM, Chairman Voroshilov arrived in Shanghai by special plane. Amidst the sounds of gongs, drums, and cheers, he stepped off the plane with a smile and shook hands with Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Vice Chairman Soong Ching Ling, Vice Premier Marshal Lin Biao, Marshal Liu Bocheng, Minister of Public Security General Luo Ruiqing, as well as Ke Qingshi, Secretary of the CPC Central Committee's Shanghai Bureau and First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the CPC, Cao Diqiu, the mayor of Shanghai, the eleven vice mayors and well-known people from all walks of life. After flying over 3,000 li between Shenyang and Shanghai, Chairman Voroshilov appeared to be in good spirits.

    The Speaker of the Chamber of Nationalities of Burma and former President Sao Hkun Hkio, who is currently visiting Shanghai, the Soviet Consul General in Shanghai, consuls from various countries stationed in Shanghai, as well as Soviet experts and Soviet citizens in Shanghai, were all at the airport to welcome him.

    Chairman Voroshilov, accompanied by Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Vice Chairman Soong Ching Ling, Vice Mayor Cao Diqiu, and others, walked past the 30,000 people waiting at the airport. Many people came forward to offer flowers to the distinguished guest.

    Subsequently, Chairman Voroshilov, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and Vice Mayor Cao Diqiu boarded a black convertible and slowly drove towards the guesthouse. Innumerable Chinese and Soviet national flags and giant Chinese and Russian banners were hung across the road for nearly twenty li. Four or five hours earlier, the sidewalks had already been packed with people, and despite the drizzling rain, Shanghai citizens were eager to come out to welcome Chairman Voroshilov. Chairman Voroshilov stood in the convertible in the light rain, waving the flowers in his hand to greet the crowds on both sides of the road.

    When the car passed the Sino-Soviet Friendship Building, the neon sign on the tower was already lit, and the square and roof of the building were packed with dense crowds, shouting "Long Live Sino-Soviet Friendship." The sounds of firecrackers and drums resounded as countless colorful balloons and white doves were released into the crowd. Chairman Voroshilov and the car were covered with flower petals thrown by the people.

    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 22nd: Chairman Voroshilov and the Soviet guests accompanying him left Shenyang by special plane at 9:00 AM this morning to visit Shanghai.

    Vice Premier He Long, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei, and Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Liu Xiao accompanied the distinguished guests to Shanghai.

    Vice Chairman Zhu De and Huang Jing, Director of the State Technological Commission, went to the airport to see off the distinguished guests. Also present at the airport were Du Zheheng, Governor of Liaoning Province, Huang Oudong, First Secretary of the CPC Liaoning Provincial Committee, Liu Baotian, Mayor of Shenyang, Jiao Ruoyu, First Secretary of the CPC Shenyang Municipal Committee, Deng Hua, Senior General, Commander of Shenyang Garrison, and people from all walks of life in Liaoning Province and Shenyang City.

    The Soviet and Korean Consuls General in Shenyang and Soviet experts in Shenyang also went to the airport to see off the distinguished guests.

    Before boarding the plane, the distinguished guests received flowers presented by young girls. Chairman Voroshilov warmly embraced Vice Chairman Zhu De in front of the plane to bid him farewell. After Chairman Voroshilov entered the cabin, he repeatedly waved goodbye to the people seeing him off through the window of the plane.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 22nd: Chairman Voroshilov and his entourage, accompanied by Vice Premier He Long of the State Council, arrived in Tianjin by special plane at 11:10 AM this morning on their way from Shenyang to Shanghai.

    Chairman Voroshilov was welcomed by Huang Huoqing, Mayor of Tianjin, after getting off the plane. At this time, suonas and golden drums played in unison, and nearly three thousand people who came to welcome the distinguished guests cheered warmly to Chairman Voroshilov, waving flowers and scarves, and jumping up and down to sprinkle colored confetti towards Chairman Voroshilov.

    When Chairman Voroshilov had lunch in the airport lounge, Major General Xiao Siming, commander of the PLA troops stationed in Tianjin, toasted him. Chairman Voroshilov said: In 1918, two companies of Chinese soldiers served in a unit under my command; I can say without exaggeration that they were the most humble and the most heroic. He proposed a toast to the fighting friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union.

    Wang Guangying, Vice Chairman of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce, raised his glass to Chairman Voroshilov on behalf of the city's capitalists. Chairman Voroshilov stood up and suggested that everyone applaud this capitalist vigorously. He said: China, through a long period of revolutionary road, found a new experience of transforming capitalists in a peaceful way without bloodshed, which is of world significance. He said to Wang Guangying: After a stage of transformation, you will certainly make more contributions to the country and the people; at that time, the people will surely forget that you were once capitalists. Then he embraced Wang Guangying and said: After returning home, I must tell our people that I once kissed such a capitalist.

    Subsequently, the Young Pioneers of Tianjin presented Chairman Voroshilov with two photos taken with Soviet children at the seaside in Beidaihe; two young embroidery workers representing the city's handicraft workers presented Chairman Voroshilov with two exquisite embroidered shirts; teachers and students of Tianjin Normal College presented Chairman Voroshilov with a seal and two Chinese paintings entitled "Eternal Evergreen" and "Pine and Crane Longevity."

    At 1:00 PM, Chairman Voroshilov flew from Tianjin to Shanghai by special plane amidst the cheers of nearly three thousand people gathered at the airport to see him off. (Attached)
