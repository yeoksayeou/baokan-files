Helping Each Other and Seeking Prosperity Together
Trade Among Socialist Countries Increases Annually

China and Poland

This newspaper reports that trade relations between China and Poland are developing and expanding year by year. In the past six years, the trade volume between China and Poland has increased almost tenfold. In 1950, the total value of commodity exchange was 34 million rubles, and in 1956, the total value of commodity exchange reached 322 million rubles.

According to the Sino-Polish Trade and Payment Agreement for 1957 signed in Warsaw in January this year, Polish industrial enterprises are designing and providing complete sets of equipment for some industrial units in China. Designers from the Krakow General Bureau of Chemical and Refrigeration Equipment have completed the technical drawings for the equipment of the China United Sugar Factory. This united factory is the third and largest sugar factory designed by Poland for China. This new sugar factory is almost three times larger than the previous two sugar factories.

In addition, Polish engineers have also carried out design work for two coal mines in China, one of which is near Beijing. Now, Polish industry has begun to provide machinery and equipment for these two coal mines.

In Sino-Polish trade, Polish exports of industrial equipment are increasingly occupying an important position. In the initial stage, Poland's exports to China were rolled products, raw materials, and food. Later, industrial machinery and equipment accounted for a large proportion. Poland exported steel rails, locomotives, vehicles, metal processing lathes, automatic cranes, tractors, and complete sets of equipment for installing industrial units, sugar factories, and other enterprises.

German Democratic Republic and Romania

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin Dispatch: According to a report by the German News Agency: The German Democratic Republic and Romania signed a commodity exchange agreement in Berlin on the 11th. The agreement stipulates that the scope of commodity exchange this year will be greatly expanded compared to last year.

Romania will export oil industry equipment, train carriages, electric motors, chemicals, ores, and agricultural products to the German Democratic Republic. The German Democratic Republic will export various equipment, consumer goods, medicines, chemicals, electrical equipment, precision machinery, and optical instruments to Romania.

Soviet Union and Poland

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw Dispatch: According to a report by the Polish Press Agency, the Polish-Soviet Trade Protocol for 1957, signed in Moscow on April 9, stipulates that the volume of commodity exchange between the two countries this year will increase by about 23% compared to last year. This increase is mainly due to the increase in Poland's imports of raw materials and grains from the Soviet Union.

This year, Poland will import 4 million tons of iron ore, 176,000 tons of manganese ore and non-ferrous metals, and 70,000 tons of cotton from the Soviet Union. Oil imports from the Soviet Union will fully meet Poland's current needs for oil. Trade with the Soviet Union will also largely guarantee the needs of Polish industry for other raw materials such as nickel, mercury, platinum, and other precious metals.

As many industrial sectors in Poland have reduced investment costs, the investment equipment imported from the Soviet Union this year will be much less than last year.

The protocol also stipulates that Poland will import watches, refrigerators, washing machines, televisions, motorcycles, and wines worth tens of millions of rubles from the Soviet Union. These goods will help improve market supply in Poland.

This year, Poland's exports to the Soviet Union will mainly be machinery and equipment and transportation equipment. Poland will export complete sets of factory equipment to the Soviet Union for the first time. As Poland has generally reduced coal exports, the amount of coal exported to the Soviet Union this year will be less than last year.

The prices of goods exchanged between Poland and the Soviet Union are determined according to world prices.

When Polish Foreign Trade Minister Trompczynski returned to Warsaw from Moscow after signing the protocol, he said that this year's Polish-Soviet trade negotiations were conducted in a very friendly atmosphere. Both sides understood each other's needs, and resolved many new issues in the negotiations, including price issues.

Hungary and Albania

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest Dispatch: Hungary and Albania signed a commodity exchange and payment agreement for 1957 in Budapest on the 11th. The total value of commodity exchange stipulated in this agreement is 40% higher than last year.

According to the agreement, Albania will supply Hungary with chromium, copper, coal, asphalt, leather, tobacco, etc.

Hungary will supply Albania with factory equipment, electrical equipment, various machines, building materials, and pharmaceuticals, etc.

    互相帮助　共求繁荣
    社会主义国家贸易与年俱增
    中国和波兰
    本报讯　中波两国贸易关系正一年比一年发展和扩大，在过去六年中，中波贸易额差不多增加了十倍。1950年，商品交换总值为三千四百万卢布，1956年，商品交换总值已达到三亿二千二百万卢布。
    根据今年1月在华沙签订的中波1957年贸易和支付协定，波兰工业企业正在为中国一些工业单位进行设计、提供成套设备。克拉科夫化学和冷藏设备总局设计师已经完成了中国制糖联合工厂设备的技术图纸的编制工作，这个联合工厂是波兰为中国设计的第三个制糖厂，也是最大的一个。这个新糖厂比过去两个糖厂差不多要大三倍。
    此外，波兰工程师还为中国两个煤井进行了设计工作，其中一个在北京附近。现在，波兰工业已开始为这两个煤井提供机器和煤井应有的设备。
    在中波贸易额中，波兰出口的工业设备日益占据重要地位。初期，波兰输往中国的货物为压延产品、原料和食品。后来，工业机器和设备占着很大的比重，波兰输出的有钢轨、机车、车辆、金属加工车床、自动起重机、拖拉机，以及供安装工业单位、糖厂和其它企业用的成套设备。
    民主德国和罗马尼亚
    新华社柏林电　据德意志通讯社报道：民主德国和罗马尼亚11日在柏林签订了一项换货协定。协定规定今年的换货范围比去年大大扩大。
    罗马尼亚将向民主德国输出石油工业的设备、火车车辆、电动机、化学品、矿砂和农产品等。民主德国将向罗马尼亚输出各种装备、消费品、药品、化学品、电气设备、精密机械和光学仪器等。
    苏联和波兰
    新华社华沙电　据波兰通讯社报道，4月9日在莫斯科签订的波兰苏联1957年贸易议定书规定，今年两国之间的换货额将比去年增加23％左右。这种增加主要是由于波兰从苏联进口的原料和谷物增加的缘故。
    今年，波兰将从苏联进口四百万吨铁矿砂、十七万六千吨锰矿砂和有色金属、七万吨棉花。从苏联进口的石油将完全能够满足目前波兰对石油的需要量。而同苏联的贸易还将在很大程度上保证波兰工业在其他原料方面如镍、汞、铂以及其他贵重金属等的需要。
    由于波兰许多工业部门减少了投资费用，今年从苏联输入的投资设备将比去年少得多。
    议定书还规定波兰从苏联输入价值达几千万卢布的表、冰箱、洗衣机、电视机、机器脚踏车和葡萄酒等。这些货物将有助于改善波兰国内的市场供应。
    今年，波兰向苏联的输出主要将是机器和装备以及运输设备。波兰将第一次向苏联输出整套的工厂设备。由于波兰普遍减少煤的出口，所以今年输往苏联的煤的数量将比去年减少。
    波苏交换的货物的价格是根据世界价格确定的。
    波兰对外贸易部长特隆姆普钦斯基在签订了议定书从莫斯科回到华沙的时候说，今年波苏贸易谈判是在非常友好的气氛中进行的，双方都了解对方的需要，在谈判中解决了好些新的问题，其中包括价格问题在内。
    匈牙利和阿尔巴尼亚
    新华社布达佩斯电　匈牙利和阿尔巴尼亚11日在布达佩斯签订了1957年的换货和支付协定。这个协定规定的换货总值比去年多40％。
    根据协定，阿尔巴尼亚将供应匈牙利铬、铜、煤、沥青、皮革、烟草等。
    匈牙利将供应阿尔巴尼亚工厂设备、电工器材、各种机器、建筑材料和医药品等。
