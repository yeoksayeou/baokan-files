Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 26th - A remarkable event has recently occurred in Soviet medical circles: a surgeon has used a new method to resuscitate a man who had been frozen for approximately eighteen hours.

The man who was saved, named Burkov, was frozen after getting lost in the snow at minus forty degrees Celsius. When he was found and taken to the hospital, his limbs were semi-flexed, his muscles were rigid, his pupils were unresponsive to light, and his body temperature was twenty-two and a half degrees Celsius. Even experienced doctors believed that there was no hope of saving him.

Volikov carefully diagnosed Burkov and decided to first give him a drug to slow down the metabolism of the body's tissues, thereby reducing the body's need for oxygen and nutrients. The doctor used a special device to regulate the frozen man's breathing, supplying oxygen to the body, and then put Burkov into a bath. The temperature of the bath was gradually raised from thirty-four degrees to thirty-eight degrees. After two hours, Burkov's pulse began to beat regularly, and his blood pressure began to rise. Glucose and vitamins were also injected into him in the bath. Burkov's muscles gradually softened, and his limbs stretched out. Twelve days later, Burkov regained consciousness but could not speak. Burkov began to relearn how to speak and recognize people. After a few months, he fully recovered his health.

    苏联医学上的创举
    人冻僵十八小时被救活
    新华社莫斯科26日电　苏联医学界最近发生了一件引人注意的事件：一个外科医生用一种新方法救活了一个已经冻僵了十八个小时左右的人。
    这个被救活的人叫布尔科夫，他是因为迷路而冻僵在零下四十度的雪地上的。当他被人发现而送进医院的时候，手脚半弯曲，肌肉硬化，瞳孔对光线无反应，体温是二十二度半。就连有经验的医生都认为他是没有救活的希望了。
    沃利科夫仔细诊断了布尔科夫，决定先给他一种药剂使机体组织的新陈代谢作用迟缓下来，从而使机体对氧和营养的需要减少。医生用一种特别的设备来调整冻僵者的呼吸，向机体输氧，然后把布尔科夫放进浴池内。浴池的温度由三十四度逐渐上升到三十八度。两小时过后，布尔科夫的脉搏开始有规律的跳动，血压开始上升。在浴池里还给他注射葡萄糖和维他命。布尔科夫的肌肉逐渐松软过来，手脚也伸张开来。十二天以后，布尔科夫才苏醒过来。但是还不能讲话。布尔科夫从新开始学讲话和认人。几个月以后，他完全恢复了健康。
