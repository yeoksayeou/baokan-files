Comrades,
    On behalf of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, in my own name, and also on behalf of the comrades who accompanied me on this visit, I extend friendly and sincere greetings to the members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress present today. (Warm applause)
    You are representatives elected by the Chinese people, and you represent the heroic brotherly People's Democratic China. We feel honored and gratified to be able to meet with you today.
    Comrades, fundamental changes are taking place in the lives of people in all countries. One-third of the world's population is confidently advancing along the path of socialism, overcoming various difficulties, and building a new and free life. It is a great happiness for us to live and work in such a historical period. We are especially pleased that our two free countries, the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, are at the forefront of socialist construction.
    The fact that socialism has taken a dominant position in the two great nations of People's China and the Soviet Union eloquently proves that the great cause of socialist transformation of the lives of people in all countries has become an unshakable historical fact, and this cause is invincible. As the liberated people of all countries engage in selfless, creative, and peaceful labor, the strength of countries building their lives according to new socialist principles is growing.
    Only under the conditions of socialist democracy can the people be fully guaranteed to actively participate in the management of the country for the first time. The unparalleled superiority of socialist democracy over bourgeois democracy is consistently an unshakeable fact.
    The strength of socialist countries lies not only in the conscious labor of millions of people, but also in the active participation of working people in the management of their own country. In history, only under the conditions of socialist democracy can the people be fully guaranteed to actively participate in the management of the country for the first time. This democracy can take various forms, but its essence is the same: it is the power of the vast majority of the people led by the working class, aimed at opposing the old capitalist system and the exploiters. The socialist state is the power of the working people themselves and a great organizational force in the construction of a new system. Socialist democracy unites millions of workers, peasants, and working intellectuals to jointly strive for the building of socialism and a new society where everyone is happy. (Applause)
    Because of this, socialist countries and the Communist Party, when solving the task of economic prosperity, are always concerned with promoting democracy and increasingly broadly attracting the masses to participate in the management of the country.
    The experience of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other countries in the socialist camp proves this.
    No matter how our class enemies slander us, the continuous development of socialist democracy and its unparalleled superiority over bourgeois democracy remains an unshakable fact.
    Anyone who holds a fair attitude towards our history will see that the building of socialism in the Soviet Union has created the prosperity of socialist democracy, and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, founded by the great Lenin, is precisely the soul and wisdom of this socialist democracy.
    The inexhaustible source of the strength of Soviet democracy lies in its economic foundation, which is the socialist economic system. Socialist public ownership thoroughly and forever eliminates the dependence of democracy and democratic organs on the moneybags of capitalists and financial tycoons, who treat democracy as a commodity in capitalist countries.
    Dear comrades, I would like to take this opportunity to briefly talk about the development of Soviet democracy.
    When we talk about Soviet democracy or Chinese people's democracy, it is clear that in order to correctly understand the democracy of our two countries, we must take into account the specific historical conditions in which our two socialist countries were born and developed.
    As everyone knows, the Soviet state was established under historical conditions where the peaceful development of the revolution was impossible.
    As soon as the world's first socialist state was born, the capitalists and landlords of Russia, united with the imperialist bourgeoisie of other countries, launched armed intervention and civil war against the Soviet state.
    During the long and brutal wars, all propertied classes, all bourgeois and petty-bourgeois parties, including the so-called socialist parties of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, colluded together and formed a united front with the counter-revolutionary imperialist bourgeoisie to oppose the young Soviet state.
    In our country, only one party steadfastly defended the fundamental interests of the working people and remained loyal to the cause of socialism. This is the Communist Party. It led the revolutionary workers, working peasants, and working intellectuals to crush the counter-revolutionary forces. All this also determined the path of development of Soviet democracy and created the characteristics of Soviet democracy.
    Since then, our country's socialist democracy, like the entire socialist construction, has developed under the leadership of the Communist Party, which has fully proved by its entire actions that it has never failed the trust and expectations of the people.
    In forty years, at least eighteen years were spent on wars and post-war reconstruction of economic, cultural, and residential facilities. For forty years, the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have transformed their country, built a strong socialist industry, organized and consolidated collectivized agriculture, and created an advanced socialist culture. For forty years, Soviet socialist democracy has developed and demonstrated its great creativity.
    The inexhaustible source of the strength of Soviet democracy lies in its economic foundation, which is the socialist economic system, the socialist ownership of the means of production, which was established by eradicating the capitalist economic system, abolishing private ownership of the means of production, and eliminating the phenomenon of man exploiting man. Socialist public ownership thoroughly and forever eliminates the dependence of democracy and democratic organs on the moneybags of capitalists and financial tycoons, who treat democracy as a commodity in capitalist countries.
    The outstanding form of democracy in our country is the Soviet, which was created by the people themselves in the revolution. We can be proud that this historically new form of the dictatorship of the working class was born in our country. The Soviet is the organization of the broadest range of working people. It guarantees that the people can constantly participate in the management of the country.
    In our country, all organs of the Soviet, from the village Soviet to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, are elected in the most democratic way through universal, direct, equal, and secret ballots.
    All Soviet citizens who have reached the age of eighteen, regardless of race, nationality, gender, religious belief, education level, length of residence, social origin, property status, and past experience, have the right to participate in the election of representatives to local and highest state power organs.
    The election of local Soviets of Working People was held in March this year. As a result, more than 1.5 million Soviets emerged from the masses to manage the country, serving as Soviet representatives to work for the welfare of the people and under the supervision of the people. Of the elected representatives, more than 60% are workers and collective farmers. Women account for 37% of the representatives to local Soviets. This proves that Soviet women enjoy equal rights and actively participate in the management of the country.
    Because the Soviet Union only has one party, enemies in the imperialist camp have spent a lot of ink slandering and saying that our country's democracy is restricted. However, this slander is not only completely refuted by the most democratic procedure of electing Soviet representatives, but also by the fact that there are both party members and non-party members among the Soviet representatives. For example, almost 55% of the representatives to the local Soviets elected not long ago are not party members, which means that the majority of the representatives are not party members. In all Soviet elections, our country's Communist Party has always formed an alliance with non-party members, and almost 100% of the voters have participated in the elections, which brilliantly proves that Soviet democracy is a truly people's democracy.
    There are many committees and various labor people's organizations around our Soviet, and these organizations regularly participate in various tasks of economic and cultural construction. Maintaining the broadest contact with the masses and fully mobilizing the political enthusiasm and creativity of the masses makes the strength of the Soviet state organs a hundred times stronger.
    Dear comrades: When talking about Soviet democracy, one cannot fail to mention the harmonious and friendly relations between the various socialist nationalities in our country. The unbreakable friendship between the various nationalities of the Soviet Union is due to the fact that the Communist Party and the Soviet government have always consistently implemented the only correct Leninist policy of complete equality and friendship between all large and small nationalities in our country. This policy is excellently embodied in the fact that all nationalities in the Soviet Union have established their own national states. Under the conditions of Soviet democracy, all our republics have achieved great achievements in developing their own economy and culture. For example, the total industrial output value of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic in 1956 increased thirty-five times compared to 1913, the Belarusian Republic increased twenty-one times, the Georgian Republic increased twenty-nine times, the Kyrgyz Republic increased forty-one times, the Armenian Republic increased forty-four times, the Tajik Republic increased twenty-six times, and so on.
    I do not want to present a large pile of figures to you here, but I should still point out that all our republics have also achieved great achievements in building a culture with national form and socialist content.
    Due to the unwavering implementation of socialist democracy, a great friendship has been formed between the various nationalities of the Soviet Union. The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has become a model of a united, strong, and multi-ethnic country.
    Soviet democracy is not formal democracy but practical democracy. The Soviet regime is not limited to announcing some democratic principles and establishing some legal systems. The democratic rights of the Soviet people are guaranteed by all the necessary material means.
    Comrades, as everyone knows, Soviet democracy is not formal democracy but practical democracy. The Soviet regime is not limited to announcing some democratic principles and establishing some legal systems. The democratic rights of the Soviet people are guaranteed by all the necessary material means. In our country, there are no exploiters, no exploitation of man by man, every citizen can get a job according to their own expertise, and can get labor remuneration according to the amount and quality of their labor. In our country, every worker and employee has a vacation every year, and wages are paid during the vacation; in our country, a free seven-year compulsory education is implemented, and a ten-year compulsory education is being gradually implemented; every worker in our country enjoys free medical care, and so on.
    When talking about socialist democracy, it should be pointed out that it not only plays a role in national life, but also in the entire socialist social life. The spirit and principles of socialist democracy run through all activities of the Party, trade unions, Communist Youth League, cooperatives, and collective farms, and all activities of cultural, scientific, and other social organizations of the working people.
    All major issues in our country's economic and socio-political life, as well as the most important bills, must go through nationwide discussions with the participation of millions of citizens.
    Due to the various measures taken to further develop socialist democracy, the activities of the entire Soviet system have become more active.
    Dear comrades, of course, I am not saying that there have never been shortcomings in the Soviet Union, or that there have never been some phenomena that have damaged Soviet democracy. We do not hide our shortcomings, but are working hard to eliminate them. As everyone knows, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union took the initiative to expose the shortcomings in the implementation of Soviet democracy at the 20th National Congress and called on all working people to further promote Soviet democracy.
    Following the instructions of the Party, the Soviet state has strengthened the supervision of the observance of the legal system and resolutely stopped any illegal acts. State laws fully guarantee that Soviet citizens enjoy the various rights stipulated in the Constitution, and protect their personal freedom and the inviolability of their homes.
    Due to the various measures taken to further develop socialist democracy, the activities of the entire Soviet system have become more active. The Soviet has faced up to various important and specific issues in economic and cultural construction and strived to meet the various needs of the residents.
    In our country, various national measures are being taken to further expand the powers of the union republics in economic management and legislation.
    Currently in the Soviet Union, the Communist Party's proposals for reforming the management of industry and construction are undergoing nationwide discussions. These proposals put forward the transition from the old form of management through various professional departments to the new form of management according to regional principles.
    The new system allows us to lead production more specifically and effectively, more broadly mobilize the creativity of the masses, while maintaining the principle of centralized planning on a national scale.
    This reform of the management of industry and construction can expand the democratic foundation of state management, better mobilize the creativity of the people, further expand the power of the union republics, and further consolidate the brotherly cooperation of the various nationalities of the Soviet Union in the unified multi-ethnic national system. (Warm applause)
    Dear comrades! While developing Soviet democracy, we also pay close attention and are very excited to see the vigorous development of democracy with special forms in the People's Republic of China. Under the special historical conditions of China, it has been possible to unite the people's forces, including the national bourgeoisie. In China, the various democratic parties and groups united in the united front are developing people's democracy together with the Communist Party, the leading force.
    The Soviet state and the Soviet people cherish very much the political, economic, and cultural transformations of world historical significance being carried out on the vast land of the great People's Republic of China. Everyone is very clear that your country's system of people's democracy can enable the broad masses of working people to actively participate in socialist construction, encouraging them to bravely fight for the motherland, for the people, and for the brotherly unity and friendship of the people of all countries.
    Comrades, finally, please allow me to wish you new and great achievements in your work, and assure you that the Soviet people will be proud of the achievements of China's socialist construction together with you, and will do everything possible to enable our two countries to move forward together in close brotherly unity, towards new victories. (Applause)
    Long live the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China and its Standing Committee! (Applause)
    Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China! (Applause)
    Long live socialist democracy!
    Long live world peace! (The whole audience stood up and applauded warmly for a long time)

    在全国人民代表大会常务委员会扩大会议上
    伏罗希洛夫主席的演说亲爱的同志们！
    我代表苏联最高苏维埃主席团，并以我个人的名义，同时也代表陪同我前来访问的同志们，向全国人民代表大会常务委员会在座的委员们致以友好的真挚的敬礼。（热烈鼓掌）
    你们是中国人民选举出来的代表，你们代表着英勇的兄弟的人民民主中国，今天能够同你们会见，我们感到很大的荣幸和欣慰。
    同志们，今天在各国人民的生活中正发生着根本的变化，世界上已经有三分之一的人口在满怀信心地沿着社会主义的道路前进，在排除各种困难，建设新的自由的生活，我们这些人生活和工作在这样一个历史时期里是很大的幸福。令我们特别高兴的是，我们两个自由的国家，中华人民共和国和苏联，都走在社会主义建设者的前列。
    在人民中国和苏联这两个伟大的国家里，社会主义已占统治地位，仅仅这一件事实就雄辩地证明，对各国人民生活进行社会主义改造的伟大事业已经成为历史上的不可动摇的事实，这一事业是不可战胜的。由于解放了的各国人民从事忘我的，创造性的和平劳动，按照新的社会主义原则建设自己生活的国家的力量正在日益增长。
    只有在社会主义民主的条件下，才第一次完全保证人民能积极地参加国家的管理。社会主义民主比资产阶级民主的无比优越，始终是一个确定不移的事实。
    社会主义国家之所以强大，不仅在于千百万人民自觉地进行劳动，而且在于劳动人民积极地参与自己国家的管理。在历史上，只是在社会主义民主的条件下，才第一次完全保证人民能积极地参加国家的管理。这种民主可以有各种各样的形式，但是它的本质只有一个：这是以工人阶级为领导的、以反对资本主义旧制度、反对剥削者为目的的绝大多数人民的政权。社会主义国家是劳动人民自己的政权，是新制度建设中的伟大的组织力量。社会主义的民主使千百万的工人、农民和劳动知识分子团结一致，共同为建成社会主义、为建设人人幸福的新社会而奋斗。（鼓掌）
    正因为这样，所以社会主义国家和共产党在解决繁荣经济的任务时，对发扬民主，对日益广泛地吸引人民群众参与国家的管理，是经常关心的。
    苏联、中华人民共和国和社会主义阵营其他国家的经验都说明了这一点。
    不管我们的阶级敌人怎样进行诬蔑，但是社会主义民主的不断发展，社会主义民主比资产阶级民主的无比优越，始终是一个确定不移的事实。
    凡是对我国的历史抱着公正态度的人，都会看到，苏联社会主义的建成造成了社会主义民主的繁荣，而伟大的列宁所创立的苏联共产党正是这种社会主义民主的灵魂和智慧。
    苏维埃民主的力量的取之不尽的源泉，在于它的经济基础是社会主义经济制度。社会主义的公有制彻底地永远地消灭了民主和民主机关对于资本家和财政巨头的钱袋的依赖性。
    亲爱的同志们，我愿借今天会见的机会，简短地谈谈苏维埃民主的发展情况。
    当我们谈到苏维埃民主或者中国的人民民主的时候，很明显，为了正确地理解我们两国的民主，我们必须考虑到我们两个社会主义国家产生和发展的具体历史条件。
    大家知道，苏维埃国家是在革命的和平发展没有可能的历史条件下成立的。
    世界上第一个社会主义国家一产生，俄国的资本家和地主就同其他国家的帝国主义资产阶级联合在一起，发动了反对苏维埃国家的武装干涉和内战。
    在长期的残酷的战争期间，所有的有产阶层，所有的资产阶级和小资产阶级政党，包括社会革命党人和孟什维克的所谓社会主义政党在内，都勾结在一起，同反革命的帝国主义资产阶级结成统一战线来反对年轻的苏维埃国家。
    在我们国家里，只有一个政党坚持不渝地维护劳动人民的根本利益，始终忠于社会主义的事业。这就是共产党。它领导了革命工人、劳动农民和劳动知识分子的力量，粉碎了反革命势力。这一切也决定了苏维埃民主的发展道路，造成了苏维埃民主的特点。
    从那时起，我国的社会主义民主，同整个社会主义建设一样，就在共产党的领导下发展起来了，共产党以自己的全部行动完全证明它一直是没有辜负人民的信任和期望的。
    在四十年里，至少有十八年是在进行战争，进行经济、文化机关和住宅的战后恢复工作，四十年来，苏联人民在共产党的领导下改造了自己的国家，建成了强大的社会主义工业，组织和巩固了集体化的农业，创立了先进的社会主义的文化。四十年来，苏维埃的社会主义民主得到了发展，并显示了它的巨大的创造力。
    苏维埃民主的力量的取之不尽的源泉，在于它的经济基础是社会主义经济制度，是生产工具和生产资料的社会主义所有制，这种制度是由于铲除了资本主义的经济制度，废除了生产工具和生产资料的私有制，消灭了人剥削人的现象而确立起来的。社会主义的公有制彻底地永远地消灭了民主和民主机关对于资本家和财政巨头的钱袋的依赖性，而在资本主义国家里，这些人是把民主当作买卖对象的。
    我国民主的卓越的形式是苏维埃，它是由人民群众自己在革命中创造的。我们可以引以自豪的是，这种历史上崭新的工人阶级专政形式是在我国诞生的。苏维埃是范围最广的劳动人民的组织。它保证人民可以经常参加国家的管理。
    在我国，苏维埃的一切机关，从村苏维埃起到苏联最高苏维埃止，都是用普遍、直接、平等、无记名投票这种最民主的方式选举出来的。
    一切年满十八岁的苏联公民，不分种族、民族、性别、宗教信仰、教育程度、居住期限、社会出身、财产状况和过去经历，都有权参加地方的和最高的国家政权机关的代表的选举。
    今年3月举行了地方的劳动人民苏维埃的选举，结果有一百五十多万苏联人从人民群众里出来管理国家，担任苏维埃代表，为人民的福利并在人民的监督下进行工作。在当选的代表中，60％以上是工人和集体农民。在地方苏维埃的代表中，有37％是妇女。这证明苏联妇女享有平等的权利，她们都在积极参加国家的管理。
    由于苏联只有共产党一个党，帝国主义阵营里的敌人曾费了不少的笔墨，进行诬蔑，说我国的民主是受到限制的。但是这种诬蔑不但被选举苏维埃代表的最民主的程序完全驳倒了，而且也被苏维埃代表中有党员和非党员这种事实完全驳倒了。例如，不久以前当选的地方苏维埃的代表中，几乎55％不是党员，就是说，大多数的代表不是党员。在一切的苏维埃选举中，我国的共产党一直是同非党员结成联盟的，几乎百分之百的选民都参加了选举，这就光辉地证明了苏维埃民主是真正人民的民主。
    在我们苏维埃的周围有很多委员会和各种的劳动人民团体，这些组织经常参加经济和文化建设的各项工作。这样同群众保持最广泛的联系，这样充分发挥群众的政治积极性和创造性，也就使得苏维埃国家机构的力量百倍增强。
    亲爱的同志们：当说到苏维埃民主的时候，不能不提到我国各个社会主义民族之间的和睦友好的关系。苏联各族人民之间所以能有这种牢不可破的友谊，是因为共产党和苏联政府始终一贯地执行我国一切大小民族完全平等友好的唯一正确的列宁主义政策。这个政策卓越地体现在苏联各族人民都建立了自己的民族国家这个事实上。在苏维埃民主的条件下，我们所有的共和国在发展本国的经济和文化方面都取得了极大的成就。例如，哈萨克苏维埃社会主义共和国的工业总产值，1956年比1913年增加了三十五倍，白俄罗斯共和国增加了二十一倍，格鲁吉亚共和国增加了二十九倍，吉尔吉斯共和国增加了四十一倍，亚美尼亚共和国增加了四十四倍，塔吉克共和国增加了二十六倍等等。
    我不想在这里向诸位提出一大堆数字，但是我还是应当指出，我们所有的共和国在建设民族形式和社会主义内容的文化方面也取得了巨大的成就。
    由于始终不渝地实行社会主义民主，苏联各族人民之间结成了伟大的友谊。苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟已经成为团结一致因而强大有力的、多民族国家的典范。
    苏维埃民主不是形式的民主而是实际的民主。苏维埃政权不限于宣布一些民主原则和建立一些法律制度。苏联人民的民主权利是由一切必要的物质资料来保证的。
    同志们，大家知道，苏维埃民主不是形式的民主而是实际的民主。苏维埃政权不限于宣布一些民主原则和建立一些法律制度。苏联人民的民主权利是由一切必要的物质资料来保证的。在我国，没有剥削者，没有人对人的剥削，每个公民都能按自己的专长得到工作，都能按自己劳动的数量和质量获得劳动报酬。在我国，每一个工人和职员每年都有休假，假期内工资照发；在我国实行了免费的七年制义务教育，并且正在逐步实行十年制义务教育；我国的每一个劳动者都享受免费的医疗，等等。
    在说到社会主义民主的时候，应当指出，它不仅在国家生活中发生作用，而且在整个社会主义社会生活中发生作用。在党、工会、共青团、合作社和集体农庄的一切活动中，在劳动人民的文化、科学团体和其他社会团体的一切活动中，都贯穿着社会主义民主的精神和原则。
    我国经济和社会政治生活中的一切重大问题，以及最重要的法案，都要经过有千百万公民参加的全民讨论。
    由于在进一步发展社会主义民主方面采取了各种措施，整个苏维埃制度的活动已更加活跃起来。
    亲爱的同志们，当然我并不是说在苏联不曾有过缺点，或者不曾有过某些破坏苏维埃民主的现象。我们并不隐瞒缺点，而是在努力消除缺点。大家知道，苏联共产党在第二十次代表大会上主动地揭露了在实行苏维埃民主方面的缺点，并且号召全体劳动人民进一步发扬苏维埃民主。
    苏维埃国家遵循着党的指示，加强了对于遵守法制的情况的监督，坚决制止任何非法行为。国家法律充分保障苏联公民享有宪法规定的各种权利，保障他们的人身自由和住宅不受侵犯。
    由于在进一步发展社会主义民主方面采取了各种措施，整个苏维埃制度的活动已更加活跃起来，苏维埃已面向经济和文化建设中的各种重要的具体问题，努力满足居民的各种需要。
    在我国，正在采取各种全国性的措施，来进一步扩大加盟共和国在经济管理方面和立法方面的职权。
    目前在苏联，对共产党提出的改革工业和建筑业的管理的建议正在进行全民讨论。在这些建议里提出了从旧的、通过各专业部门进行管理的形式过渡到新的、按地区原则进行管理的形式。
    新的制度使我们可以更具体更有效地领导生产，更广泛地发挥群众的创造性，同时保持全国范围内的集中的计划原则。
    工业和建筑业的管理的这种改革可以扩大国家管理的民主基础，更好地发挥人民的创造性，更加扩大加盟共和国的权力，并进一步巩固统一的多民族国家体系中的苏联各族人民的兄弟合作。（热烈鼓掌）
    亲爱的同志们！我们在发展苏维埃民主的同时，也非常注意并且十分兴奋地看到中华人民共和国的具有特殊形式的民主的蓬勃发展。在中国的特殊历史条件下，已经能够把包括民族资产阶级在内的人民力量团结起来。在中国，团结在统一战线中的各个民主党派和团体，正在同共产党这个领导力量一起，来发展人民民主。
    苏维埃国家和苏联人民十分珍视在伟大的中华人民共和国的辽阔的国土上所实行的具有世界历史意义的政治、经济、文化生活方面的改造。大家都很清楚，你们国家的人民民主制度能够使广大的劳动群众积极参加社会主义建设，鼓舞他们去为祖国、为人民、为世界各国人民的兄弟团结和友谊而英勇奋斗。
    同志们，最后请允许我预祝你们在工作中取得新的巨大成就，并且向你们保证，苏联人民将同你们一起为中国社会主义建设的成就而自豪，并将尽一切努力来使我们两国在紧密的兄弟般的团结中共同前进，走向新的胜利。（鼓掌）
    中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会及其常务委员会万岁！（鼓掌）
    苏联和中华人民共和国的牢不可破的友谊万岁！（鼓掌）
    社会主义民主万岁！
    世界和平万岁！（全场起立，经久不息地热烈鼓掌）
              （以上小题是本报编者加的）
