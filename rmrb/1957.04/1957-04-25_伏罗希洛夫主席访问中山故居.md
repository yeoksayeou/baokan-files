Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 24th: Chairman Voroshilov visited Sun Yat-sen's former residence in Shanghai this morning.

Chairman Voroshilov, accompanied by Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Vice Premier He Long, and First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee of the CPC Ke Qingshi, toured the reception room, dining room, bedroom, and study in the former residence.

Chairman Voroshilov pointed to a large portrait of Mr. Sun Yat-sen hanging on the wall of the reception room and told Chairman Liu Shaoqi that he had seen this photograph before. It was taken when Mr. Sun Yat-sen reorganized the Kuomintang in 1924 and established the three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to farmers and workers.

Upstairs in the bedroom, Chairman Voroshilov saw a photo of Madame Sun Yat-sen Soong Ching-ling and Madame Kalinin on the mantelpiece. This photograph was taken thirty years ago when Madame Sun visited Moscow in accordance with Mr. Sun Yat-sen's wishes before his death. Chairman Voroshilov put on his glasses and carefully looked at the photo, smiling and saying that after so many years, it looked both like and unlike.

Chairman Voroshilov also signed the guest book at the former residence as a souvenir.

In the afternoon, Chairman Voroshilov visited the Children's Palace. More than four thousand children in Shanghai warmly welcomed their most distinguished guests.

    伏罗希洛夫主席访问中山故居
    据新华社上海24日电　伏罗希洛夫主席今天上午访问了孙中山先生在上海的故居。
    伏罗希洛夫主席由刘少奇委员长、贺龙副总理和中共上海市委第一书记柯庆施等陪同，参观了故居里的会客室、餐厅、卧室和书房。
    伏罗希洛夫主席指着会客室壁上悬挂的一张中山先生巨像，告诉刘少奇委员长说，他早就见过这张照片。这是中山先生在1924年改组国民党，确定联俄、联共、扶助农工三大政策时拍摄的。
    在楼上的卧室里，伏罗希洛夫主席在壁炉架上看到了孙夫人宋庆龄和加里宁夫人的合影。这张照片是三十年前孙夫人根据中山先生生前的愿望访问莫斯科时拍摄的。伏罗希洛夫主席带上眼镜细细地观看了这张照片，他笑着说，隔了这么多年，看起来又像又不像。
    伏罗希洛夫主席还在故居纪念簿上签字留念。
    下午，伏罗希洛夫主席参观了少年宫。上海市四千多个少年儿童在这里热情地接待了他们最尊贵的客人。
