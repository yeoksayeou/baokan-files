Xinhua News Agency, London, April 3rd: According to information here, the United Nations Disarmament Commission Subcommittee's secret meeting concluded its preliminary discussion on the issue of atomic explosion tests on the 3rd. The Soviet representative, Zorin, spoke at the meeting that day.

	Zorin first pointed out that the Soviet Union believes that it is necessary to reach a positive agreement on the issue of banning atomic and hydrogen weapon tests without delay. The Soviet government has announced that if Western governments currently disagree with completely abandoning atomic and hydrogen weapon tests, the Soviet government is prepared to propose discussing a cessation of such tests for a certain period as the first step in this regard. In addition, the Soviet government also suggested separating the issue of atomic and hydrogen weapon tests from the overall disarmament issue and resolving it separately.

	Zorin emphasized that the representatives of Western countries opposed raising the issue of banning atomic weapon and hydrogen weapon tests at the subcommittee. British representative Noble opposed reaching an agreement on banning atomic weapon and hydrogen weapon tests, on the grounds that banning tests would create an illusion of security and peace. The spirit of the statement by US representative Stassen was the same. At the same time, both of them used the excuse that banning tests would not completely eliminate the danger of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons.

	Zorin said that it goes without saying that banning the testing of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons does not solve, and cannot solve, the entire nuclear weapon problem, but this by no means means that the members of the subcommittee should not now take concrete and practical steps to solve the problem of banning atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons. Banning the testing of these types of weapons would be the first step in solving this problem. The insistence by US and British representatives that stopping the testing of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons would only create a false sense of security is clearly just an attempt to justify their open refusal to reach an agreement on stopping the tests.

	Zorin said that the US representative opposed immediately stopping the testing of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, and put forward many conditions to be met before stopping the tests. For example, he said that there is no question of stopping tests at all before the production of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons is stopped. Zorin said that if this issue is treated in this way, then the issue of banning atomic weapon and hydrogen weapon tests will in fact be delayed indefinitely.

	Zorin said, how do Western countries, mainly the United States and Britain, counter the Soviet Union's simple and clear proposal to stop atomic weapon and hydrogen weapon tests or temporarily suspend such tests? They only hope to be cautious when testing atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, and propose to conclude agreements on the prior registration of atomic weapon and hydrogen weapon explosions and on limited supervision of such explosions, as well as agreements on the establishment of supervisory bodies to monitor and further study the possibility of stopping or limiting tests. These proposals by Western countries are essentially measures to legalize the expansion of atomic armaments.

	Zorin finally said that the Soviet representative regrets that the United States and Britain have adopted a position that does not seek to resolve the issue of banning the testing of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons. The Soviet representative expressed his belief that Western countries, especially the United States and Britain, which bear special responsibility for this issue, will change their views and do everything possible to promote a positive solution to the issue of stopping the testing of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons.

### 在裁军小组委员会会议上  苏联斥责西方不肯停止氢弹试验  主张单独解决禁止核武器试验问题

    在裁军小组委员会会议上
    苏联斥责西方不肯停止氢弹试验
    主张单独解决禁止核武器试验问题
    据新华社4日讯　据塔斯社伦敦3日讯：据这里透露，联合国裁军委员会小组委员会秘密会议3日结束了关于原子核爆炸试验问题的初步讨论。苏联代表佐林在这一天会议上发了言。
    佐林首先指出，苏联认为必须毫不迟延地就禁止原子武器和氢武器试验问题达成积极的协议。苏联政府已经宣布，如果西方国家政府目前不同意完全放弃原子武器和氢武器试验，苏联政府准备提出讨论在一定时期内停止这种试验，作为这方面的第一个步骤。此外，苏联政府还建议把原子武器和氢武器的试验问题从总的裁军问题里分出来，单独加以解决。
    佐林强调指出，西方国家的代表在小组委员会上反对提出关于停止核武器试验的问题。英国代表诺布尔反对就禁止试验原子武器和氢武器问题达成协议，理由是似乎禁止试验会造成安全和安宁的错觉。美国代表史塔生发言的精神也是一样。同时他们两个人都借口说，禁止试验不会完全消除原子武器和氢武器的危险。
    佐林说，不用说，禁止试验原子武器和氢武器并不解决、而且也不可能解决整个原子核武器问题，但这绝不意味着，小组委员会的委员现在就不应当采取具体实际的步骤，来解决禁止原子武器和氢武器的问题。禁止试验这类武器将是解决这个问题的第一步。美英代表硬说停止试验原子武器和氢武器似乎只能造成一种虚伪的安全感，显然只是想为他们公开拒绝就停止试验问题达成协议的行为作某种辩护。
    佐林说，美国代表反对立刻停止试验原子武器和氢武器，提出了在停止试验之前要实现的许多条件。例如，他说，在停止生产原子武器和氢武器之前，根本谈不上停止试验。佐林说，如果这样对待这个问题，那末，禁止原子武器和氢武器试验的问题事实上就会无限期地拖延下去。
    佐林说，西方国家，主要是美国和英国怎样来对抗苏联关于停止原子武器和氢武器试验或者暂时中止这种试验的简单而明确的建议呢？它们只是希望在试验原子武器和氢武器时要慎重，并且建议缔结关于预先登记原子武器和氢武器爆炸的协定和关于对这种爆炸的有限的监督，以及关于成立监督机构来监督和进一步研究可能停止或限制试验的问题的协定。西方国家这些建议实质上是企图使扩充原子军备合法化的措施。
    佐林最后说，苏联代表遗憾的是，美国和英国采取了并不谋求解决禁止试验原子武器和氢武器问题的立场。苏联代表表示相信，对这个问题负有特别责任的西方国家、首先是美国和英国，将会改变自己的看法，竭尽力量来促进停止试验原子武器和氢武器问题的积极解决。
