Xinhua News Agency, April 28th – The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently issued a notice requiring all localities to earnestly implement the measure of "appropriately increasing private plots for agricultural cooperative members to grow pig feed," believing it to be an effective way to develop pig farming and solve the feed problem.

The notice stated that the key to developing pig farming lies in earnestly solving the feed problem, especially the green fodder problem. Otherwise, plans for developing pig farming are just empty talk. To this end, various localities may, according to actual needs and local conditions, appropriately increase some private plots for agricultural cooperative members to grow the feed needed for their pig raising. In this way, the private plots of cooperative members can be higher than the percentage stipulated in the cooperative's charter: not exceeding 5% of the local average land per person. In some areas, private plots can reach 10%. Moreover, with more pigs, there will be more fertilizer, and the grain yield generally will not decrease.

The notice also stated that vigorously developing green fodder is another way to solve the feed problem. Whether in the South or the North, there are many wild vegetables, leaves, and aquatic plants that can be used to raise pigs. These things can also be stored in silos for winter after simple processing. Various localities can promote the method of collecting and storing green fodder to raise pigs, in order to reduce the cost of pig farming.

    给社员增加自留地种植养猪饲料
    中共中央发出通知
    新华社28日讯　中共中央最近发出通知，要求各地认真执行“给农业社社员适当地增加自留地来种植养猪饲料”的办法；认为这是发展养猪业解决饲料的有效办法。
    通知说，发展养猪业的关键，在于认真地解决饲料问题，尤其是青饲料问题。否则发展养猪的计划就是空谈。为此，各地可根据实际需要和当地条件，酌量给农业社社员增加一些自留地来种植社员养猪所需的饲料。这样，社员自留地可以高于社章规定的：不超过当地每人平均土地数的5％。某些地区自留地可以达到10％。而养猪多后肥料也多，粮食产量一般仍不会减少。
    通知还说，大力发展青饲料是解决饲料的另一办法。无论南方和北方都有很多野菜、树叶和水生植物可以养猪；这些东西经过简单加工还能青储起来备冬。各地可以推广采储青饲料养猪的办法，来减低养猪的成本。
