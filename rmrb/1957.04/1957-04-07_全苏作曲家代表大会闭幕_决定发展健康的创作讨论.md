Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th Dispatch: The Second All-Union Congress of Soviet Composers concluded on the 5th. Soviet party and state leaders attended the closing ceremony.

Soviet composer Kabalevsky spoke at the closing ceremony about the growing ties between Soviet composers and foreign musicians. He said that the great movement of people of all countries to defend peace has a great impact on the development of modern culture and art. Now music stands side by side with progressive literature at the forefront of the fight for peace and for the progressive ideals of our time.

Prior to this, renowned composers Khrennikov and Yarustovsky made concluding remarks. Yarustovsky believed that the opinions and criticisms made by the speakers at the congress were correct. He said that it is necessary to pay great attention to regular musical work. While boldly innovating and developing the style of opera, one should always remain true to the spirit of Glinka's national opera and to the principle of absorbing folk music traditions.

Khrennikov said: We have done very weak work in studying and promoting the musical achievements of the various republics. We hope that the soon-to-be-established "Soviet Composer" publishing house will be able to help us in this regard. Another major shortcoming of ours is that we have had very few discussions in the past. Discussions often take place outside the venue and are not always principled.

The congress unanimously adopted a letter to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

The letter stated that the Second All-Union Congress of Soviet Composers was an important historical milestone in the development of Soviet music. The composers are determined to constantly struggle against all tendencies that deviate from socialist realism, against the influence of formalism and individualism, and against artistic primitivism. The composers are determined to fundamentally improve the activities of their organizations, strive to democratize their working methods, develop healthy and beneficial creative discussions, and fight to raise the demands on skill.

    全苏作曲家代表大会闭幕
    决定发展健康的创作讨论
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联作曲家第二次全国代表大会5日闭幕。苏联党和国家的领导人也参加了闭幕式。
    苏联作曲家卡巴列夫斯基在闭幕式上谈到了苏联作曲家和外国音乐家日益扩大的联系。他说，各国人民保卫和平的伟大运动对现代文化和艺术的发展有巨大的影响。现在音乐同进步文学并肩站在为和平、为当代进步理想而奋斗的战士的前列。
    在这以前，著名作曲家赫连尼科夫和雅鲁斯托夫斯基作了总结发言。雅鲁斯托夫斯基认为在代表大会上发言的人所提的意见和批评是正确的。他说，必须要十分重视经常性的音乐工作。在大胆地革新和发扬歌剧风格的时候，应当永远忠实于格林卡的民族歌剧的精神，忠实于吸收民间音乐传统的原则。
    赫连尼科夫说：我们在研究和宣传各共和国的音乐成就方面的工作做得非常薄弱。我们希望，即将成立的“苏联作曲家”出版局能够在这方面帮助我们。我们还有一个很大的缺点就是过去很少进行讨论，讨论经常是在会场以外进行，而且并不总是具有原则性的。
    大会一致通过了给苏联共产党中央委员会的一封信。
    信中说，苏联作曲家第二次全国代表大会是苏联音乐发展中的重要的历史里程碑。作曲家们决心要同一切脱离社会主义现实主义的倾向、同形式主义和个人主义的影响以及同艺术上的原始派经常作斗争。作曲家们决心要根本改善自己的组织的活动，竭力使其工作方式民主化，发展健康的和有益的创作讨论，为提高对技巧的要求而斗争。
