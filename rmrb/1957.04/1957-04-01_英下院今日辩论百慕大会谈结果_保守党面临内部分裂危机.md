Xinhua News Agency, London, March 31st: On the eve of the British House of Commons debate on April 1 regarding the results of the Bermuda Anglo-American talks, the Macmillan government is facing a crisis of internal division within the Conservative Party.

It is reported that after Salisbury resigned on the 29th due to disagreement with the government's decision to release Archbishop Makarios, some senior government officials are considering resigning in support of Salisbury. At the same time, Conservative MPs who disagree with the government's decision are also raising the question of whether the government's new Cyprus policy is the result of pressure from the United States. Sixty to seventy backbenchers are brewing opposition to the government's new Cyprus policy and are considering demanding that Macmillan privately provide them with new assurances on the matter.

Another issue plunging the Conservative Party into tension is that the Conservative "Suez Group," which advocates a tough stance towards both Egypt and Makarios, is uneasy about British newspaper reports that Macmillan intends to accept Egypt's proposed terms for paying canal tolls. They are urging the government not to make concessions on the Suez issue.

Sources say that some Conservative MPs are dissatisfied with the United States not allowing Britain to control the atomic warheads of missiles. They accuse the Bermuda talks agreement on the United States providing missiles to Britain of handing Britain's defense over to the United States.

Some newspaper commentators point out that, in addition to the Conservative Party's own problems, Macmillan has many explosive issues on his agenda. These are: the major strike of 1.7 million machinists and shipbuilders, and the great anger expressed by British public opinion towards the government's insistence on conducting hydrogen bomb tests on Christmas Island.

    英下院今日辩论百慕大会谈结果
    保守党面临内部分裂危机
    据新华社31日讯　伦敦消息：在英国下院将要在4月1日辩论百慕大英美会谈结果的前夕，麦克米伦政府正面临着保守党内部分裂的危机。
    据报道，在索耳兹伯里因为不同意政府释放马卡里奥斯大主教的决定而在29日辞职以后，有些政府高级官员正考虑要用辞职的行动来支持索耳兹伯里。同时，不同意政府决定的保守党议员也在提出这样一个问题：政府新的塞浦路斯政策是不是美国施加压力的结果？六、七十个后座议员正酝酿要反对政府新的塞浦路斯政策，并且考虑要求麦克米伦私下在这个问题上给他们提供新的保证。
    使保守党内部陷入紧张局面的另一个问题是，主张对埃及和马卡里奥斯都要采取强硬态度的保守党“苏伊士集团”，对于英国报纸传说麦克米伦打算接受埃及提出的关于缴纳运河通行费的条件感到不安，他们竭力要求政府不要在苏伊士问题上让步。
    有消息说，有一部分保守党议员对美国不让英国掌握导弹的原子弹头这一点感到不满，他们指责百慕大会谈关于美国向英国提供导弹的协议是要把英国的防务交给美国。
    有些报纸评论员指出，麦克米伦除了保守党本身的问题以外，在他的记事牌上还有许多爆炸性的问题。这就是：一百七十万机器制造工人和造船工人的大罢工，英国舆论对政府坚持要在圣诞岛进行氢弹试验所表现的巨大愤怒。
