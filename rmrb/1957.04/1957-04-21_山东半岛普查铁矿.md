    Iron Ore Survey in Shandong Peninsula
    The eleven survey and exploration teams under the Shandong Provincial Office of the Ministry of Geology have now mostly set out for the Shandong Peninsula, central Shandong, and southern Shandong to conduct surveys and prospecting.

    These "treasure hunters" preliminarily confirmed five promising mineral locations during last year's survey. Now, they will strive to complete the exploration of a magnesite mine and an iron ore mine this year and in the first quarter of next year, and focus on surveying and exploring iron ores suitable for direct input into open-hearth steelmaking with an iron content of over 50%, as well as other mineral deposits.

    山东半岛普查铁矿
    地质部山东省办事处所属十一个普查和勘探队，目前大部都已出发到山东半岛、鲁中、鲁南等地进行普查探矿。
    这些“探宝者”去年在普查中已初步肯定了较有希望的矿产地五处。现在，他们要争取在今年和明年第一季度完成对一处菱镁矿和一处铁矿的勘探，并重点普查和勘探适于直接投入平炉炼钢用的、含铁量在50％以上的铁矿，以及其他矿藏。
