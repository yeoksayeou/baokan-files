    Commemorating the Great Revolutionary Martyr Li Dazhao
    Li Longmu
    (I)
    April 28th this year marks the 30th anniversary of Comrade Li Dazhao's martyrdom. On this mournful day, people cannot help but recall his great achievements in the history of our country's revolution and communist movement.
    Comrade Li Dazhao was the first thinker and enlightener in our country to propagate the significance of the October Revolution, promote Marxist ideology, and call for taking the path of the October Revolution. His articles, "A Comparative View of the French and Russian Revolutions," "The Victory of the Common People," and "The Victory of Bolshevism," published successively in 1918, unveiled the first page of Marxist propaganda in our country; at the same time, they indicated that the May Fourth Movement was different from the old democratic movements of the past and began to take on a new character. Comrade Li Dazhao was a representative of those pioneers who ushered in a new historical era. His historical contribution is primarily manifested here.
    We can see the rich and profound internal connection between the propaganda activities initiated by Comrade Li Dazhao and the May Fourth Movement from the following aspects.
    The New Culture Movement of the May Fourth era began relatively early. Before Comrade Li Dazhao published those articles publicizing the significance of the October Revolution, the banner of "opposing old morality and advocating new morality, opposing old literature and advocating new literature" had already been raised high and had aroused considerable repercussions among young intellectuals. At this time, the New Culture Movement was still a bourgeois democratic movement. It carried out a thorough anti-feudal struggle, lifted the shackles of feudal ideology, and enabled young people to bravely pursue new ideas, objectively opening the way for the subsequent spread of Marxist ideology. Therefore, its positive role should not be underestimated. But in any case, the New Culture Movement at this time still had significant shortcomings, it did not point out the real way out for the Chinese people. Not to mention the bourgeois reformist intellectuals, even some radical democrats were no exception, they were actually in a state of bewilderment and loss. Take Chen Duxiu as an example, he strongly advocated democracy and criticized the restoration of the monarchy, and made significant contributions in opposing old morality and old literature, and was thus reasonably called the main general of the New Culture Movement. But as for how to achieve true democracy, he actually knew nothing at the time. Therefore, when he discussed the political situation at the time, he would instead put forward some wrong proposals to compromise with the Northern Warlords. This seemingly contradictory phenomenon was precisely the result of their failure to find a real way out for the Chinese people. The fact that the early New Culture Movement took democracy as its central slogan while emphasizing not criticizing actual politics was a desperate measure they took in their bewilderment and loss. Li Dazhao, on the other hand, correctly discussed the world significance of the October Revolution in his articles, and confidently declared to the Chinese people: "The Russian revolution is just a single leaf of the paulownia tree that startles the world in autumn," "Try to look at the future world, it must be the world of red flags." As a result, he actively set about introducing Marxist ideology and used this ideology to examine the problems of China, which only then began to point out the real way out for the Chinese people.
    Before Comrade Li Dazhao promoted Marxist ideology, the progressive intellectuals' inability to point out the path of liberation for the Chinese people was largely due to their lack of a clear anti-imperialist viewpoint. Since they were still only bourgeois democrats at the time, they always regarded Anglo-American democratic politics as the standard. After the end of the European War, Chen Duxiu was still following the propaganda of the Allied Powers in the inaugural speech of the "Weekly Review," repeating the deceptive talk that the result of the European War was "justice over power," and calling Wilson "the best man in the world," which is evidence of this. Although there was no lack of reservations in his wording, the superficial understanding of Anglo-American imperialism was obvious. Li Dazhao, on the other hand, expressed different opinions from these people when he publicized the significance of the October Revolution. He pointed out that the end of the European War was "the victory of Bolshevism," the "achievement of Marx," and the "achievement of Lenin...", not the victory of the Allied Powers; and further pointed out that even their "political destiny is afraid of dying out soon like German militarism," essentially pointing out that these two imperialist groups were really birds of a feather. The development of history immediately confirmed Comrade Li Dazhao's point of view with vivid facts. The scramble for spoils by Britain, the United States, France, etc. at the Paris Peace Conference, their beastly plunder of Germany, especially their support for Japanese imperialism's seizure of Shandong, made people truly realize the face of the Allied imperialists, and many people (including Chen Duxiu) turned to support the October Socialist Revolution under this historical lesson and began to pursue socialist ideas.
    Comrade Li Dazhao's initiation of the publicity of the significance of the October Revolution and the promotion of Marxist ideology in our country not only pointed out the correct path for the Chinese people and gave the New Culture Movement a new quality, but also began to combine the ideological struggle against feudalism with the political struggle against warlords. Before this, although the New Culture Movement held high the banner of anti-feudalism, it had little connection with the political struggle against warlords, despite its advocacy of democratic politics and opposition to the restoration of the monarchy. Not criticizing actual politics was almost an unwritten law of the "New Youth" magazine. But Li Dazhao's publicity of the significance of the October Revolution had the direct effect of opposing Duan Qirui's traitorous rule. Originally, Duan Qirui was relying on Japanese imperialism at that time in order to obtain foreign debts to realize his ambition of carrying out military unification. To this end, he acted as a pawn of the Japanese warlords, not only chanting against "radicals," but also sending troops to Siberia, which aroused the opposition of the people. Li Dazhao's publicity of the significance of the October Revolution played the role of exposing the anti-communist slanders and supporting the people's anti-Duan struggle. His articles such as "The Victory of Bolshevism" directly criticized Duan Qirui's conspiracy to use the end of the European War to brag about himself in an attempt to increase his political capital. Although the New Culture Movement of the May Fourth era also played an important role in awakening young people in its early stage, the scope of its influence was not very broad. In order to provoke a debate, the editors of "New Youth" even had to fabricate a fake reader's letter signed Wang Jingxuan opposing the literary revolution as the object of the debate. But once the articles publicizing the significance of the October Revolution appeared and linked the ideological struggle against feudalism with the political struggle against warlords, the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution unfolded face to face, beginning what people at the time called "the great battle of new and old ideas," which became the prelude to the May Fourth mass movement.
    The above points can roughly explain how significant changes Comrade Li Dazhao's beginning of the publicity of the October Revolution and Marxism caused in the political and ideological struggles at that time, and this change could not but have a decisive influence on the May Fourth Movement. The May Fourth Movement was a united front movement that included broad strata. Influencing this movement were bourgeois ideas as well as preliminary Marxist ideas. The movement also ran through two different lines in its struggle demands, one limiting the problem to the removal of a few pro-Japanese bureaucrats, and the other pointing the spearhead of struggle at the entire imperialism and warlord rule, demanding true national liberation and democratic freedom. Obviously, what actually occupied the main position in the movement was the latter idea and the latter line. This fully proves the ideological guidance role played by Comrade Li Dazhao and the intellectuals represented by him who had preliminary communist ideas in the May Fourth Movement. It is precisely because of this that the May Fourth Movement became a thorough anti-imperialist and anti-feudal movement, and could promote the combination of Marxism and the workers' movement in its subsequent development, preparing for the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party. The reason why the May Fourth Movement became a movement that divided the historical era of our country lies in this.
                    (II)
    Comrade Li Dazhao's life was a life of a revolutionary intellectual constantly pursuing the truth and striving to transform himself. The May Fourth Movement period was the period when he carried out the enlightenment work of Marxist ideology in our country, and it was also the period when he transformed himself into a Marxist.
    From his student days, around the time of the Xinhai Revolution, Comrade Li Dazhao was an active democrat. After the establishment of the "Republic of China" after the Xinhai Revolution, he was encouraged to study methods of realizing democratic politics. But Yuan Shikai's sabotage of democracy and his self-proclaimed emperor destroyed his ideals. He carried out the struggle against Yuan Shikai during his study abroad, but at the same time, he had begun to be disappointed with the merely formal parliamentary politics of bourgeois democracy. In the following years, he tried to encourage young people with the spirit of revolutionary optimism, but he was groping hard for the actual way out for China. It was not until the victory of the October Revolution that the light of Marxism illuminated the road for him, and he became the earliest propagandist of the October Revolution and Marxism in our country. The May Fourth Movement period was precisely the transition period when Comrade Li Dazhao and other revolutionary intellectuals like him transformed from democrats to Marxists. The victory of the October Revolution and the development of the proletarian revolution in Eastern and Central Europe gave them great encouragement, making them determined to take the road of the October Revolution, and immediately set about studying and promoting Marxist ideology, and re-examining the problems of the Chinese revolution. Therefore, in the essential sense, they are fully worthy of being the earliest group of communists in our country. However, they were still in the process of transforming from democrats to Marxists at that time, so a comprehensive observation will show that their thoughts also embody all the complexity of this transition period. In Comrade Li Dazhao's thoughts at that time, there were both democratic ideas and remnants of utopian socialist ideas, and even complex influences of Kropotkin's mutual aid theory and Tolstoy-style ruralism could be seen. The simultaneous existence of these complex ideas in one person, on the one hand, proves his efforts to explore the way out to solve China's problems arduously in recent years, and on the other hand, it also proves the insignificance of the theoretical preparation of the existing Marxist ideology in our country before the victory of the October Revolution. As for the attacks from various reactionary ideas and the distortions of revisionist trends of thought that were received when starting to publicize Marxist ideology, it goes without saying. Under such circumstances of heavy subjective and objective difficulties, our pioneers finally overcame the influence of various erroneous ideas and transformed themselves, opening up the initial path for the realization of Marxism in our country from the thorns, which cannot but make us extremely excited.
    The reason why Comrade Li Dazhao and other revolutionary intellectuals like him were able to quickly complete the transition from democrats to Marxists was largely due to their departure from the standpoint of resolute revolutionaries, their firm support for the October Revolution, and their grasp of the revolutionary center of Marxist ideology. The repercussions caused by the victory of the October Revolution in our country were extremely broad, and many bourgeois intellectuals also praised it and were encouraged. The broadness of this influence clearly proves the wise conclusion that "the May Fourth Movement occurred under the call of the world revolution at that time, under the call of the Russian revolution, and under the call of Lenin." But among all those who were influenced by the October Revolution, only those who insisted on the road of the October Revolution and opposed replacing the road of the October Revolution with the spirit of reformism could truly turn to the Marxist position. Li Dazhao was a representative of this group of advanced figures, and he first grasped the revolutionary spirit of Marxist ideology when he studied and promoted it. His "My View of Marxism" was published in May 1919, and it was the earliest article in our country that introduced Marxist ideology in a relatively comprehensive and brief manner. In this article, he focused on grasping Marx's theory of class struggle, pointing out that this was "a golden thread" that "fundamentally linked" the various principles of Marx's theory. After the spread of Marxist ideology began, Hu Shi wrote the notorious article "Study More Problems, Talk Less About Doctrines," insidiously carrying out attacks and slanders; Comrade Li Dazhao, in his article "Re-discussing Problems and Doctrines" refuting him, also refuted Hu Shi's fallacies of reformism with one blow from the fundamental point that there must be a "fundamental solution," that is, the road of revolution must be taken. It is precisely because he insisted on the road of the October Revolution and insisted on Marx's theory of class struggle that although his Marxist cultivation was far from complete at that time and the remnants of old ideas were very complicated, it was not difficult for him to be remedied in the revolutionary struggle, enabling new ideas to overcome old ideas and enabling himself to develop into a true Marxist. From Comrade Li Dazhao's experience, it not only specifically proves that our country's revolution is the continuation of the great October Socialist Revolution, but also shows that the experience of the Chinese revolution has proven from the beginning that to learn Marxism well, one must firmly grasp its revolutionary spirit, and deviating from this spirit will lead people to a dangerous path.
    In the process of Comrade Li Dazhao's transformation into a Marxist, the tradition of revolutionary democracy played an important role. The characteristic of believing in the masses of the people and relying on the strength of the masses of the people in this tradition made him start to spread this thought to the working masses when he began to publicize Marxist ideology. In early 1919, his understanding of Marxism was far from complete, but he had already begun to pay attention to the workers' problem. On the "Weekly Review" that he participated in editing, a column of "Domestic Labor Conditions" was opened from the third issue (January 5, 1919), and a short essay written by him recording the life of Tangshan coal mine workers was published, which is a concrete explanation. At the same time, he also paid great attention to the power of the peasants. Around the May Fourth Movement, he put forward slogans such as "go to the people" more than once, calling on young people to go to the countryside. Here, although he mistakenly regarded the victory of the October Revolution as the result of the Populists' "going to the people," it was undoubtedly correct in China at that time to emphasize going to the countryside to mobilize the peasants in addition to paying attention to the workers' problem. It was also at this time that he clearly put forward a correct principle, that is, "If you want to import modern civilization from the bottom into society, you must integrate the intellectual class with the labor class." He earnestly practiced this proposition himself. He never regarded Marxism as a pure offering in the study, but implemented the principle of theory linking with practice. After the May Fourth Movement, he led other communist intellectuals in Beijing to organize communist groups and actually went to the workers to engage in propaganda and organizational work, combining Marxism with the workers' movement and preparing for the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party. Comrade Li Dazhao set an example for intellectuals to combine with workers and peasants. The earliest group of communist intellectuals in our country proletarianized themselves in this way.
    The Marxist theoretical cultivation of communists always needs to grow through continuous learning and practice, and this was naturally even more so in the early days of the introduction of Marxist ideology into our country; it is impossible to imagine a "superman" who is a mature Marxist as soon as he appears. But adhering to the revolutionary spirit of Marxism and adhering to the connection with reality and with the workers and peasants is a prerequisite for anyone who really wants to learn Marxism well. Comrade Li Dazhao's development provides us with a vivid example.
                    (III)
    After the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party, Comrade Li Dazhao was not only an outstanding revolutionary activist, but also became one of the leaders of the Party. He led the Party's organizations in various parts of the north in Beijing for a long time, launching the struggle against imperialism and the Northern Warlord government. He actively engaged in the workers' movement and led the great February 7th strike. Later, he represented the Party and discussed with Mr. Sun Yat-sen, promoted the reorganization of the Kuomintang in 1924 and the decision of the Three Great Policies, and laid the foundation for the revolutionary upsurge during the First Revolutionary Civil War. In 1925, he led the struggle in the north to support Mr. Sun Yat-sen's northwards, demanding the convocation of the National Assembly and opposing the Aftermath Conference; he led the movement for tariff autonomy against the Duan Qirui government. On March 18, 1926, the famous anti-imperialist and anti-warlord demonstration broke out, and he was the organizer and direct participant of the movement. During this period, he was the main leader of the revolutionary movement in the north. After the start of the Northern Expedition, the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution became more intense, and the Feng system warlord Zhang Zuolin implemented an extremely brutal white terror rule in Beijing. However, Comrade Li Dazhao always insisted on working in a very dangerous environment, and did not leave the revolutionary post for a single step. Finally, on April 9, 1927 (some say April 6), he was arrested by the Feng system warlord who was supported and instructed by imperialism. Many other revolutionaries were arrested with him. In prison, he suffered all kinds of torture from the enemy, but always showed the highest revolutionary integrity of a communist. On April 28, this great revolutionary, one of the creators and leaders of the Chinese Communist Party, was sent to the gallows by the crazy warlords, and sacrificed heroically and gloriously. His death not only inspired the communists who were still struggling hard at that time, but also aroused a deeper hatred for the warlord government among all honest people.
    1927, this is a year that the Chinese people can never and should not forget. In this year, the counter-revolutionaries buried the vigorous Great Revolution in the blood of the workers and peasants. On April 9, Zhang Zuolin carried out a large-scale anti-communist arrest; at this time, it was also when Chiang Kai-shek was preparing his counter-revolutionary coup. On April 12, Chiang Kai-shek carried out his counter-revolutionary coup, and the blood of communists spread all over Shanghai and Nanjing; on April 28, Zhang Zuolin also brutally killed Comrade Li Dazhao and other revolutionaries. At this time, they were still formally fighting parties, but they had actually acted in unison on the point of counter-revolution and anti-communism. In the anti-revolutionary torrent that was consistent from north to south, many outstanding communists, the elites of the national democratic revolution who grew up in the May Fourth era, sacrificed under the butcher's knife of the counter-revolutionaries. The blood of the people flowed into rivers. Our victory today is built on the blood and bones of these martyrs. We will think of all this from time to time, and not necessarily for the psychology of retaliation. We should always remind ourselves and educate the younger generation to know how arduous, tortuous, and bloody the road the Chinese revolution has taken, so that we can cherish the fruit that has grown extremely abundantly today even more, and work harder, wholeheartedly, and realistically to build socialism. Our pioneers had cut through thorns in a wilderness and opened up the initial road for the realization of communism in China, until they gloriously shed their last drop of blood. Their hardships and difficulties are simply incomparable to our situation today. We must strive to make ourselves worthy of being their descendants.

    纪念伟大的革命先烈李大钊同志
    李龙牧
    （一）
    今年4月28日，是李大钊同志殉难的三十周年纪念日。在这个沉痛的日子里，人们不能不想起他在我国革命和我国共产主义运动历史上的丰功伟绩。
    李大钊同志是最早在我国宣传十月革命的意义，宣传马克思主义思想，号召走十月革命的道路的思想家和启蒙者。他在1918年先后发表的“法俄革命的比较观”，“庶民的胜利”，“布尔什维主义的胜利”这几篇文章，揭开了我国马克思主义宣传的第一页；同时表明五四运动已不同于过去的旧民主主义运动，而开始带有了新的性质。李大钊同志是那些开创了一个新的历史时代的先驱者们的代表。他的历史功绩首先表现在这里。
    我们可以从以下几方面看到李大钊同志所开始的这个宣传活动与五四运动之间的丰富而深刻的内部联系。
    五四新文化运动的开始是比较早的。在李大钊同志发表那几篇宣传十月革命胜利意义的文章之前，“反对旧道德、提倡新道德，反对旧文学、提倡新文学”的旗帜已经高张起来了，并在青年知识分子中引起了相当的反响。这时新文化运动还只是资产阶级民主主义性质的运动，它进行了彻底反封建的斗争，解除了封建思想的束缚，使青年们勇敢地起来追求新思想，客观上为以后马克思主义思想的传播打开了道路。因此不应该轻视它的积极作用。但无论如何，这时的新文化运动还是有重大缺点的，它没有向中国人民指出真正的出路。资产阶级改良主义知识分子不用说了，连一些急进民主主义者也不例外，他们实际上正处于彷徨失路之中。以陈独秀为例，他曾极力主张民主、抨击帝制复辟，在反对旧道德旧文学等方面都有着重大的贡献，因而被合理地称为新文化运动的主将。但对于怎样能实现真正的民主，实际上他当时也一无所知。因而在他论及当时的政治局势时，便反而会提出一些错误的和北洋军阀妥协的主张。这种表面上矛盾的现象正是他们找不到中国人民的真正出路的结果。前期新文化运动以民主主义为中心口号而又强调不批评实际政治，正是他们在彷徨失路中采取的不得已的办法。而李大钊则在他的文章中正确地论述了十月革命的世界意义，满怀信心地向中国人民宣告：“俄国的革命，不过是使天下惊秋的一片桐叶罢了”，“试看将来的环球，必是赤旗的世界”。由此，他积极着手介绍马克思主义思想，并用这种思想来考察中国问题，这才开始给中国人民指出了真正的出路。
    在李大钊同志宣传马克思主义思想之前，进步知识分子之不能给中国人民指出解放的道路，在很大的程度上也是由于他们缺少明确的反对帝国主义的观点。他们当时既然还只是一些资产阶级民主主义者，也便总是把英美民主政治看作标准。欧战结束之后，陈独秀在“每周评论”发刊词中还在跟着协约国的宣传重复所谓欧战结果是“公理战胜强权”的欺人之谈，把威尔逊说成是“世界上第一个好人”，这便是一个证据。虽然在他的措词中也不无保留，但对英美帝国主义认识的浅薄终是显而易见的。而李大钊在宣传十月革命的意义时就已经发表了与这些人不同的意见。他指出欧战的结束是“布尔什维主义的胜利”，是“马克思的功业”，“列宁……的功业”，而不是协约国的胜利；而且还进而指出，就是它们的“政治命运，也怕不久和德国的军国主义同归消亡”，实质上指明这两个帝国主义集团实在是一丘之貉。历史的发展立即以活生生的事实证实了李大钊同志的观点。英美法等在巴黎和会上的分赃斗争，他们对德国的野兽般的掠夺，尤其是它们的支持日本帝国主义强夺山东，使人们真正认识了协约国帝国主义的面貌，许多人（包括陈独秀）正是在这个历史教训之下转而拥护十月社会主义革命，并开始追求社会主义思想的。
    李大钊同志在我国开始宣传十月革命的意义、宣传马克思主义思想，不只给中国人民指出了正确的道路，使新文化运动具有了新的质量，而且还开始把反封建的思想斗争与反军阀的政治斗争结合了起来。在这以前，新文化运动虽然高举了反封建的大旗，但是尽管它主张民主政治、反对帝制复辟，却与反军阀的政治斗争没有什么联系。不批评实际政治，几乎是“新青年”月刊的不成文法。但李大钊宣传十月革命的意义却有着直接反对段祺瑞的卖国统治的作用。原来，当时段祺瑞正投靠日本帝国主义，借以取得外债，以遂其实行武力统一的野心。为此，他充当了日本军阀的走卒，不仅高唱反对“过激派”，而且曾出兵西伯利亚，引起了人民的反对。李大钊宣传十月革命的意义正起了揭穿反共的谰言，并支持人民的反段斗争的作用。它的“布尔什维主义的胜利”等文，更直接抨击了段祺瑞利用欧战结束来自吹自擂，以图增加政治资本的阴谋。五四新文化运动在其前期虽然也起了唤起青年的重要作用，但影响的范围还不十分广阔。为了引起论战，“新青年”的编者们甚至要虚拟一封署名王敬轩的反对文学革命的假读者来信，作为论战对象。而一到宣传十月革命意义的文章出现，并把反封建的思想斗争和反军阀的政治斗争联结在一起之后，革命与反革命的斗争这才面对面地展开起来，开始了当时人们所说的“新旧思潮的大激战”，成了五四群众运动的先声。
    以上几点大体上可以说明，李大钊同志开始宣传十月革命和马克思主义，在当时的政治斗争和思想斗争上引起了多么重大的变化，这种变化不能不给五四运动以决定性的影响。五四运动是一个包括广大阶层的统一战线的运动。影响着这个运动的有资产阶级思想，也有初步的马克思主义思想。运动在斗争要求上也贯串着两条不同的路线，一种把问题局限于撤换几个亲日派官僚，一种则把斗争锋芒指向整个帝国主义和军阀统治，要求实行真正的民族解放和民主自由。很显然，在运动中占主要地位的实际上是后一种思想和后一条路线。这就充分证明了李大钊同志和以他为代表的具有初步共产主义思想的知识分子，在五四运动中所起的思想指导作用。正因此，五四运动才成为彻底反帝反封建的运动，才能在以后的发展中促进了马克思主义与工人运动的结合，准备了中国共产党的建立。五四运动之成为一个划分我国革命历史时代的运动，其原因便在于此。
                    （二）
    李大钊同志的一生是一个革命的知识分子不断追求真理，努力改造自己的一生。五四运动时期是他在我国进行了马克思主义思想的启蒙工作的时期，也是他自己转变成马克思主义者的时期。
    从学生时代起，在辛亥革命前后，李大钊同志便是一个积极的民主主义者。辛亥革命之后，“中华民国”的建立曾鼓舞他研究实现民主政治的方法。但袁世凯的破坏民主、帝制自为，把他的理想轰毁了。他在留学生活中进行了反对袁世凯的斗争，但同时，对资产阶级民主主义的徒具形式的议会政治也已开始失望。在此后的几年中，他曾努力用革命乐观主义的精神鼓舞青年，但对中国的实际出路，却在艰苦的摸索中。直到十月革命胜利，马克思主义的光芒给他照亮了道路，他成了我国最早的一个十月革命和马克思主义的宣传者。五四运动时期，这正是李大钊同志和与他相同的其他一些革命知识分子由民主主义者转变成马克思主义者的过渡时期。十月革命的胜利，以及无产阶级革命在东欧和中欧的发展给了他们以极大的鼓舞，使他们决心要走十月革命的道路，并立即着手学习和宣传马克思主义思想，从新观察中国革命的问题。因此，就本质的意义说来，他们完全称得起是我国最早的一批共产主义者。但是，他们当时还处在由民主主义者转变成马克思主义者的过程中，因而全面地观察时便会看出，他们的思想也体现了这个过渡时期的全部复杂性。在李大钊同志当时的思想中，便既有民主主义思想、又有空想社会主义思想的遗留，甚至还可以看到克鲁泡特金互助论思想、托尔斯泰式的乡村主义等等的复杂的影响。这些复杂的思想同时存在于一个人身上，一方面证明他在几年中艰苦地探索解决中国问题的出路的努力，一方面也反证了十月革命胜利以前我国已有的马克思主义思想的理论准备之微不足道。至于在开始宣传马克思主义思想时所受到的外界各种反动思想的攻击，修正主义思潮的歪曲，就更不必说了。在这样主客观困难重重的情形之下，我们的先驱者终于战胜了各种错误思想的影响，并改造了自己，为马克思主义在我国实现而从荆棘中开出最初的一条路，这不能不使我们万分感奋。
    李大钊同志及与他相同的其他一些革命知识分子之所以能迅速完成由民主主义者向马克思主义者转变的过渡，在很大程度上是由于他们从坚决的革命者的立场出发、坚决拥护十月革命，并抓住了马克思主义思想的革命的中心。十月革命的胜利在我国引起的反响是极广泛的，许多资产阶级知识分子也曾加以赞颂，并受到鼓舞。这种影响的广泛性明显地证明了“五四运动是在当时世界革命号召之下，是在俄国革命号召之下，是在列宁号召之下发生的”这个英明的论断。但在所有受到十月革命影响的人中，只有那坚持十月革命的道路，反对用改良主义精神顶替十月革命道路的人，才能真正转到马克思主义立场上来。李大钊就是这一批先进人物中的代表，他学习和宣传马克思主义思想时首先掌握了它的革命的精神。他写的“我的马克思主义观”发表于1919年5月，是我国最早的一篇比较全面地概略介绍马克思主义思想的文章。他在这篇文章中便着重地抓住了马克思主义的阶级斗争学说，指出这是把马克思学说的诸原理“从根本上联络起来”的“一条金线”。在马克思主义思想的传播开始之后，胡适写了那臭名远扬的“多研究些问题，少谈些主义”的文章，阴险地实行攻击和诬蔑；李大钊同志在反驳他的文章“再论问题与主义”中，也正是从必须有“根本解决”，也就是必须走革命的道路这一根本点上，一击而中地驳斥了胡适的改良主义谬论。正因为他坚持十月革命的道路，坚持马克思主义的阶级斗争学说，所以尽管当时他的马克思主义修养还远不完备，旧思想的遗留还很驳杂，但他却不难在革命斗争中得到补救，使新思想克服旧思想，并使自己发展成为一个真正的马克思主义者。从李大钊同志的经历中，不只具体证明了我国革命是伟大的十月社会主义革命的继续，而且可以由此看出，中国革命的经验从一开始便证明，要学好马克思主义，必须紧紧掌握着它的革命精神，背离这种精神，是会把人们带到危险的路上去的。
    李大钊同志转变成马克思主义者的过程中，革命民主主义者的传统起了重要的作用。这种传统中的相信人民群众、依靠人民群众的力量这个特点，使得他在开始宣传马克思主义思想的时候，便开始着手要把这种思想传播到工人群众中去。在1919年初，他对马克思主义的理解还远不完备，但是他已开始注意工人问题。在他参加编辑的“每周评论”上，从第三期（1919年1月5日）起辟过“国内劳动状况”一栏，刊登过他写的记载唐山煤矿工人生活的短文，便是一个具体的说明。与此同时，他也很注意农民的力量。在五四运动前后，他不只一次地提出过“到民间去”的一类的口号，号召青年到农村中去。在这里，虽然他曾把十月革命的胜利误认为是民粹主义者“到民间去”的结果，但在当日的中国，在注意工人问题之外又强调到农村去发动农民却无疑是正确的。也就在这时，他明确地提出了一个正确的原理，即“要想把现代的文明从根底里输入到社会里面去，非把知识阶级与劳工阶级打成一片不可”。他自己切实实践了这个主张。他从不把马克思主义当作书斋中的清供，而贯彻着理论联系实际的原则。五四运动之后，他领导北京其他一些共产主义知识分子组织共产主义小组、实际到工人中去从事宣传和组织工作，使马克思主义与工人运动结合了起来，为中国共产党的建立作了准备工作。李大钊同志为知识分子树立了他们和工农结合的范例。我国最初的一批共产主义知识分子正是这样使自己无产阶级化的。
    共产党人的马克思主义理论修养总需经过不断学习和实践才能成长起来，在马克思主义思想传入我国的初期自然更是如此；不可能设想有一出现便是成熟的马克思主义者的“超人”。但坚持马克思主义的革命精神，坚持与实际、与工农群众的联系，却是任何真正要学好马克思主义的人的必备条件。李大钊同志的发展为我们提供了一个生动的例证。
                    （三）
    中国共产党成立之后，李大钊同志已不只是一个卓越的革命活动家，而且成了党的领导者之一。他长期在北京领导党在北方各地的组织，展开反对帝国主义和北洋军阀政府的斗争。他曾积极从事工人运动，领导了伟大的二七罢工。以后，他代表党和孙中山先生商谈，促成了1924年国民党的改组和三大政策的决定，实现了共产党和国民党的第一次合作，奠定了第一次国内革命战争时期革命高潮的基础。1925年，他在北方领导了支持孙中山先生北上，要求召开国民会议、反对善后会议的斗争；领导过反对段祺瑞政府的关税自主运动。1926年3月18日，爆发了著名的反帝反军阀的示威，他是运动的组织者和直接参加者。在这个时期中，他一直是北方革命运动的主要领导者。北伐战争开始以后，革命与反革命的斗争更加剧烈了，奉系军阀张作霖在北京实行着极残暴的白色恐怖统治。但是李大钊同志始终在万分危险的环境下坚持工作，一步也不离开革命的岗位，终于，在1927年4月9日（一说6日），被受帝国主义支持和指使的奉系军阀逮捕了。和他同时被捕的还有其他许多革命者。在监狱中，他受尽了敌人的各种折磨，但始终表现了共产党人的最高的革命气节。4月28日，这个伟大的革命者，中国共产党的创造者和领导者之一，被疯狂的军阀送上了绞架，英勇而壮烈地牺牲了。他的死不只激励了当时还在艰苦中奋斗的共产党人，也引起了一切正直的人们对军阀政府的更深的仇恨。
    1927年，这是中国人民永远不能也不应忘记的一年。这一年，反革命把生气蓬勃的大革命葬送在工农群众的血泊中。4月9日，张作霖实行了反共的大逮捕；这时，也正是蒋介石准备好了他的反革命政变的时候。4月12日，蒋介石实行了他的反革命政变，上海南京各地洒遍了共产党人的鲜血；4月28日，张作霖也就惨杀了李大钊同志和其他革命者。这时，他们在形式上还是在作战中的双方，但在反革命、反共这一点上，却已在实际上一致行动了。在南北一致的反革命逆流中，多少优秀的共产主义者，五四运动时代成长起来的民族民主革命的精英，牺牲在反革命的屠刀下。人民的鲜血流成了江河。我们今天的胜利正是建筑在这些牺牲者的鲜血和尸骨上的。我们会不时想起这一切，并不必一定是为了睚眦必报的心理，我们应该时时提醒自己并教育青年一代知道，中国革命曾走过了一条如何艰苦曲折、血迹斑斑的道路，以便能更加爱护这今日已成长得极为丰硕的果实，更加全心全力艰苦朴实地为建设社会主义而工作。我们的先驱者曾在一片荒原中披荆斩棘，给共产主义在中国的实现开出最初的一条道路，直至光荣地流尽自己的最后一滴血。他们的艰苦困难与我们今天的情形简直无法比较，我们必须努力使自己不愧为他们的后辈。
