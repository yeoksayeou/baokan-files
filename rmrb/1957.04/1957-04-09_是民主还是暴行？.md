Is it Democracy or Atrocity?

The Mollet government is doing its utmost to conceal the truth about its atrocities in Algeria from the French public, while constantly touting France's democratic contributions there. However, the few materials that have leaked out of Algeria are enough to make one judge what role France is playing there.

Cancellation of Freedom of Speech

In Algeria, people have no freedom of speech. It has been contemptuously cancelled by the French colonial authorities. All forms of expressing opinions are obstructed, and democratic and progressive newspapers are banned. The organ of the Algerian General Confederation of Labor, "Algerian Workers," is confiscated every time it is published. Finally, the French Resident Minister, Lacoste, finally ordered it to be banned. The editorial staff of the "Algerian Workers" newspaper were tried for "endangering national security"; the newspaper's correspondents and distributors in various factories were also detained by the police.

Forced Labor

Due to the "cleansing" and "sweeping" operations frequently carried out by the French army, "a large number of people have been displaced." In areas with insufficient labor, the French military police collude with business owners to force residents to work.

During the harvest in June last year, thousands of men, women, and children were transported by truck to work, including children as young as twelve. They worked silently under the supervision of machine guns; if they dared to refuse, they would be immediately detained or punished with another kind of unpaid and arduous labor.

"Protection Camps"? "Death Camps"?

The French colonial authorities have established many concentration camps throughout Algeria. Tens of thousands of Algerian patriots are imprisoned in them: nationalists, communists, trade union workers, progressives, Muslims and residents of European descent, as well as children under ten and old people of eighty. They are detained simply because someone "informed" on them.

The French colonialists euphemistically call these concentration camps "protection camps," but Algerians call them "death camps," because it is difficult for people to come out of here healthy after being tortured.

Torture, Death Penalty

According to the specific laws of the French colonial authorities, accused persons are not immediately sent to court for trial after being arrested, but are detained in police stations, where the police can inflict all kinds of cruel punishments. Such as electric shock, foot whipping, suffocating punishments, and psychologically deranged punishments, which often cause the victims to be disabled, insane, and dead.

In February of this year, the French authorities arrested lawyer Ali Boumendjel, tortured him, and cut his throat. Boumendjel was fortunate enough not to die, but he was summoned from the hospital for further torture shortly after, and was finally driven mad.

The experience of Blanche Inana, secretary of the Algiers Provincial Trade Union Council, is another appalling example. Inana was detained for three days and three nights, and subjected to all kinds of torture that damaged human dignity. The colonialists stripped her naked and placed her on an insulated platform, and passed electric current through her legs, chest, stomach, waist, and throat, and pinched her nose and poured water into her mouth until she was completely suffocated.

According to statistics, thousands of people in Algeria have been subjected to this kind of cruel punishment.

The French colonial authorities have adopted even more brutal methods against the fighters of the Algerian national liberation movement. Since the beginning of this year, nearly three hundred people have been executed or sentenced to death without trial.

    是民主还是暴行？
    摩勒政府极力向法国公众隐瞒它在阿尔及利亚暴行的真相而不断鼓吹法国在那里的民主贡献，但是从阿尔及利亚透露出来的一些不多的材料已经足以使人作出判断，究竟法国在那里是个什么角色。
    取消言论自由
    在阿尔及利亚，人们是没有言论自由的。它已被法国殖民当局轻蔑地取消了。一切表达意见的形式都受到阻挠，民主和进步的报刊被禁止发行。像阿尔及利亚工会联合会的机关报“阿尔及利亚工人”，每次一出版就被没收。最后法国驻节部长拉戈斯特终于下令禁止它出版了。“阿尔及利亚工人”报的编辑人员，因“危害国家安全”而受到审判；报纸在各工厂中的通讯员和分发员也被警察拘留起来。
    强迫劳动
    由于法国军队经常进行的“清乡”和“扫荡”，造成了“大批人口的流徙”。在劳动力不足的地区，法国军警同企业主勾结在一起强迫居民劳动。
    去年6月收获期间，几千名男女和儿童被卡车运去劳动，其中甚至有十二岁的儿童。他们在机关枪的监视下默默地干活；如果敢于拒绝，就立即会被拘留起来，或是改罚作另一种既无报酬、又很繁重的劳动。
    “保护营”？“死亡营”？
    法国殖民当局在阿尔及利亚各地，建立了许多集中营。成千上万的阿尔及利亚爱国者被关禁在里面：有民族主义者、共产党人、工会工作者、进步人士、穆斯林和欧洲血统的居民，也有不到十岁的小孩和八十岁的老人。他们被拘留起来，仅仅因为有人“告发”。
    法国殖民者把这些集中营美其名曰“保护营”，阿尔及利亚人却把它叫作“死亡营”。因为人们在这里备受折磨后是很难健康地活着出来的。
    酷刑、死刑
    依照法国殖民当局特定的法律，被控告的人被捕后不立即送到法院去受审判，而是拘留在警察局里，任凭警察施以种种残酷的刑罚。如电刑、笞蹠刑、使人窒息的刑罚和使人心理变态的刑罚等，它们常使受刑人残废、疯狂和死亡。
    今年2月，法国当局逮捕了阿里·波曼杰律师，对他进行拷问并且割伤了他的喉咙。波曼杰侥幸没有死去，但不久以后他从医院被传去再度受刑讯时，终于被折磨疯了。
    阿尔及尔省工会理事会书记勃朗歇·英阿纳的遭遇，是另一个骇人的例子。英阿纳被拘留了三天三夜，受到种种损害人类尊严的酷刑。殖民者把她脱光了放在绝缘台上，在她的腿上、胸部、肚子、腰和咽喉通以电流，并且捏住她的鼻子，把水灌进她的嘴里，直到她完全窒息为止。
    据统计，在阿尔及利亚，受到这类残酷刑罚的已有好几千人。
    对于阿尔及利亚民族解放运动的战士，法国殖民当局采取了更加残暴的手段。今年以来，已有将近三百人未经审讯就被执行死刑或宣告死刑。
