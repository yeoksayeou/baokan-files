　　Recently, many people have been talking about rising prices, and some even have complaints. Some commodities have indeed risen in price, but how much impact does this have on our lives? I have thought about this question.
　　I am the wife of a printing worker. Before the wage reform, my husband earned 58 yuan a month, and after last year's wage reform, he earned 61.8 yuan a month. The whole family of five lives on his salary. As far as I know, the recent price increases of commodities related to our lives include: sesame oil, which has increased from 68 cents per jin to 81 cents per jin; fine salt, which used to sell for 14 cents a bag, now sells for 17 cents a bag; pork has increased from 77 cents per jin to 82 cents per jin, and vegetables are also more expensive than before; Renmin brand soap has increased from 14 cents a bar to 17 cents. These price increases do have an impact on the lives of workers, but if you think about it carefully, the impact is not that great. Buying grain is the biggest living expense in my family. We have to buy 114 jin of rice and flour every month, which costs about 20 yuan, accounting for one-third of the total expenses, but the rice and flour sold by the state have not increased in price. Recently, the supply and marketing cooperative in our area made reasonable adjustments to grain prices. White flour decreased from 9.55 yuan per bag (50 jin) to 9.50 yuan per bag; Xiaozhan rice also decreased from 20.9 li per jin to 20.7 li per jin. Although oil, salt, and meat have increased in price, we don't eat much of them every month, so the impact is not significant. Under normal circumstances, the whole family eats an average of one jin of meat, ten liang of sesame oil, one jin of fine salt, and one and a half jin of coarse salt, and uses six bars of soap per month, which only increases expenses by 3 jiao 5 fen and 5 li compared to the past. Other daily necessities such as coal briquettes, firewood, alkali, and peanut oil have not increased in price. In terms of clothing, the price of wool has increased more, but we don't wear it, so it has little to do with us. Cigarettes have also increased in price, but only high-end cigarettes such as Double Happiness and China brands have increased. I have to buy three packs of Da Ying Hai cigarettes for my mother-in-law and husband every month. This type of cigarette has not increased in price and remains at 1 jiao 7 fen a pack.
　　I plan to spend 12 yuan every month to buy vegetables for the whole family. Vegetable prices are expensive this year, which does have an impact on our lives. At this time last year, 1 jiao could buy four or five jin of spinach, but this year each jin of spinach costs at least 6 fen per jin. Therefore, we eat less vegetables than before. I hope that the state must pay attention to the production and management of vegetables in the future, which is very important for improving our lives.

### 对我们家生活影响不大

    对我们家生活影响不大
    傅秀玉
    最近，许多人都在谈论物价涨了，有的还有埋怨情绪。有些商品的确涨了价，但是对我们生活究竟有多大影响呢？我想过这个问题。
    我是一个印刷工人的妻子。丈夫在工资改革前每月拿工薪五十八元，去年工资改革后每月拿六十一元八角。全家五口人都靠他的薪金过日子。据我了解，最近涨价的商品和我们生活有关的有：香油，由过去六角八分一斤上调到八角一斤；细盐，过去卖一角四分一袋，现在卖一角七分一袋；猪肉由七角七分一斤上调到八角二分一斤，蔬菜也比过去贵了，人民牌肥皂由一角四分一块涨到一角七分。这些商品涨价，对职工的生活不能说没有影响，但是认真算起来，影响是并不大的。买粮食，在我家算是一笔最大的生活开支，每月要买米、面一百十四斤，约花二十元，占开支总数的三分之一，但国家出售的米面一直没有涨价。最近，我们那边的供销合作社，对粮食价作合理调整后，白面由过去的九元五角五分一袋（五十斤），下降为九元五角一袋；小站米也由过去二角零九厘一斤，下降为二角零七厘一斤。油、盐、肉等虽然涨了些价，可是我们每月吃的不多，所以影响也不大。按照一般情况，全家每月平均吃一斤肉，十两香油，一斤细盐，一斤半大盐，用六块肥皂计算，不过比过去增加支出三角五分五厘。其他日常生活必需的煤球、劈柴、碱、花生油，都没有涨价。拿穿的来说，涨价较多的是呢绒，我们又不穿它，和我们关系不大。香烟也涨价了，但涨价的仅是双喜、中华牌等高级香烟。我每月要给婆婆、丈夫买三条大婴孩香烟，这种烟并没有涨价，一直是一角七分一盒。
    我每月都计划用十二元给全家买菜吃。今年蔬菜价贵，对我们的生活确有影响。去年这个时候，一角钱可买四、五斤菠菜，今年每斤菠菜至少要卖六分钱一斤，因此我们吃的蔬菜比过去少了。希望国家今后必须重视蔬菜的生产和经营，这对改善我们的生活有很大关系。
