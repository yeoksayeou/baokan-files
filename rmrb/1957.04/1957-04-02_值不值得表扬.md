Worthy of Praise?
　　The March 4th People's Daily editorial "Actively Participate in Social Savings" praised an ordinary worker's family in the Xi'an Textile Factory. The family of five has a monthly income of fifty-four yuan. Because the housewife, Ma Yueping, is careful and frugal, they can often participate in savings. I don't think this kind of thing is worth praising. Because their family's monthly vegetable expenses are only 3.8 yuan (excluding oil, salt, sauce, and vinegar), it proves that their life is very hard. Since their income is low, why save money for savings? If they could eat meat a few times a month and still have extra money to participate in savings, then that would be worth praising. Wu You

    值不值得表扬
    3月4日人民日报社论“积极参加社会储蓄”一文中，表扬了西安纺织厂一个普通工人家庭。他全家五口人，每月收入五十四元，由于主妇马月平精打细算，所以能经常参加储蓄。我认为像这种事情，是不值得表扬的。因为他们家庭每月菜蔬开支只有三元八角（不包括油盐酱醋），证明他们的生活是很苦的，既然收入少，何必再省钱储蓄呢？如果他们每月能吃几次肉，而又有余钱去参加储蓄，那才值得表扬。　武友
