Xinhua News Agency, London, April 17th: British newspapers, commenting on the discussions of the United Nations Disarmament Commission's subcommittee on the issue of reducing atomic armaments, mentioned the United States' proposals on this matter. "The Observer" said that the U.S. representative, Stassen, requested supervision over the production of fissile materials and advocated that, after a mutually agreed period, such materials should not be used for military purposes. The U.S. proposal also stated that countries that do not currently possess nuclear weapons should not possess them in the future.
　　"The Sunday Times" and "The Daily Telegraph and Morning Post" said that Britain and France supported the U.S. plan.
　　It has been learned here that the Soviet representative, Zorin, at a recent subcommittee meeting, made some comments on the U.S. proposal and the Soviet Union's position on banning atomic weapons and eliminating them from the armaments of all countries. Zorin pointed out that the countries participating in the subcommittee all recognized that resolving the issue of reducing atomic armaments is a particularly important issue at present, and if there is a deadlock on this issue, it will be difficult to guarantee the security of the people of all countries and the peaceful development of all countries.
　　Zorin said that some people regard atomic weapons as a basic tool of their policy, and they do everything possible to supply atomic weapons to more and more countries that do not yet have them. Zorin pointed out that the atomic war preparations actively underway in Western countries recently show that the danger of atomic war is expanding. He said that world public opinion has expressed concern about this and demanded urgent measures to stop testing atomic weapons, prohibit the stationing of atomic corps on the territory of other countries, prohibit equipping the military with atomic weapons, and demanded a complete ban on atomic weapons and the elimination of atomic weapons from the equipment of all countries.
　　After reiterating the Soviet Union's consistent policy of eliminating atomic weapons and using atomic energy for peaceful purposes, Zorin pointed out that the preliminary discussions of the subcommittee proved that the Western countries holding atomic weapons—the United States and Britain—have not taken measures sufficient to ensure that the most urgent issues in this matter can be practically resolved.
　　U.S. representative Stassen spoke at the subcommittee on April 12th, saying that the United States does not yet see any basis sufficient for everyone to agree to sign a treaty "stipulating the complete elimination of nuclear weapons."
　　The U.S. representative also stated on the 15th that "as long as there is no decision to completely eliminate nuclear weapons," the United States "is unwilling to conclude such an agreement for the complete and unconditional prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons."
　　The attitude of Noble, the representative of Britain, another Western country possessing atomic weapons, is the same.
　　Zorin said that if the United States declared its willingness not to station atomic forces on the territory of other countries and not to equip the armies of other countries with atomic weapons, this would be an important step in preventing atomic war. He said that it is now impossible to avoid these issues. It is now necessary to clearly express an attitude towards these issues in order to guarantee the signing of an agreement that meets the demands of peace-loving people.
　　Zorin pointed out that the U.S. representative Stassen's proposal does not solve the problem of stopping the production of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, and of course, there is even less talk of eliminating such weapons from the armaments of all countries.
　　Zorin concluded by saying that the Soviet delegation still hopes that Western countries, especially countries that possess atomic weapons, can find a way to reach an agreement in order to stop the atomic arms race and save mankind from the threat of atomic war.

### 西方在裁军问题上裹足不前  苏联重申禁止核武器的主张

    西方在裁军问题上裹足不前
    苏联重申禁止核武器的主张
    据新华社19日讯　据塔斯社伦敦17日讯：英国报纸在评联合国裁军委员会小组委员会关于裁减原子军备问题的讨论时谈到美国在这个问题上的建议。“观察家报”说，美国代表史塔生要求对分裂物质的生产实行监督，并且主张在经过大家商定的一定时期以后，这种物质不得在军事上使用。美国的建议还认为目前没有核武器的国家将来不得拥有这种武器。
      “星期日泰晤士报”和“每日电讯与晨邮报”说，英国和法国支持美国的计划。
    这里获悉，苏联代表佐林在最近一次小组委员会会议上，就美国的建议和苏联对禁止原子武器和从各国的军备中取缔原子武器的问题所采取的立场发表了一些意见。佐林指出，参加小组委员会的国家都认识到，解决裁减原子军备的问题是当前一个特别重要的问题，如果在这个问题上僵住了的话，各国人民的安全以及各国的和平发展就难以保证。
    佐林说，但是有些人把原子武器当作是自己政策的基本工具，他们尽一切方法把原子武器供给越来越多的、至今还没有这种武器的国家。佐林指出，最近在西方国家积极进行的原子战争准备说明，发生原子战争的危险扩大了。他说，全世界舆论已经对此表示不安，而且要求采取紧急措施停止试验原子武器，禁止在他国领土上驻扎原子兵团，禁止用原子武器装备军队，并且要求完全禁止原子武器和从各国的装备中取缔原子武器。
    佐林在重申了苏联一贯主张取缔原子武器和把原子能用于和平目的的政策以后指出小组委员会的初步讨论情况证明，握有原子武器的西方国家——美国和英国还没有采取足以保证能实际解决这个问题中的最紧要问题的措施。
    美国代表史塔生4月12日曾经在小组委员会上发言说，美国现在还看不出有任何基础足以使大家同意签订一项“规定完全取缔核武器”的条约。
    美国代表还在15日表示“只要还没有决定完全取缔核武器”，美国“就不愿意缔结这种完全和无条件禁止使用核武器的协定”。
    另一个拥有原子武器的西方国家英国的代表诺布尔的态度也是这样。
    佐林说，如果美国声明愿意不在别国领土上驻扎原子部队和不用原子武器装备别国军队，这将是防止原子战争方面的一个重要步骤。他说，现在要想回避这些问题是不可能的了。现在必须对这些问题明确地表示态度，以保证签订符合爱好和平人民的要求的协定。
    佐林指出，美国代表史塔生的建议解决不了停止制造原子武器和氢武器的问题，当然就更谈不到从各国的军备中取缔这种武器了。
    佐林最后说，苏联代表团仍然希望西方国家，首先是拥有原子武器的国家能找到达成协议的道路，以便制止原子军备竞赛，把人类从原子战争的威胁中拯救出来。
