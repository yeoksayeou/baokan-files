    Let's talk more about "calling out to the painting."

    After Liu Mengmei enters the study, he slowly turns around, walking softly. He sits down, supporting himself on the desk with his hand, indicating slight fatigue. He recites, "Let me carefully unfold it and have a look, ah! What a solemn countenance," sings the melody "Erlangshen," "To be properly placed, this compassionate face should only be on a lotus throne." His gaze isn't particularly focused, but he uses both hands, first bending them together in a lotus shape, then changing to palms facing upwards to create the posture of a seated Buddha, eyes slightly closed. Suddenly, he opens his eyes wide, seeing a standing image. He sings, "Eh, why is she standing tall and graceful to the left of the plum and willow?" He covers his right sleeve with his left sleeve, presses the right corner of the table, raises his left sleeve high, stands on his right leg, uses the tip of his boot to lift the hem of his robe with his left leg, his whole body slightly rising and falling to express the meaning of standing tall and graceful.

    He slowly returns to the left corner of the table, presses on the table corner with his right hand, and makes the same movements as above. He sings, "Not planting a purple bamboo forest, not placing a parrot beside her." His face expresses doubt. He slowly sits down, but then thinks that Guanyin should have a purple bamboo forest and a parrot beside her. He raises his right hand high to make a gesture imitating a parrot, points downwards at the painting with his left hand, his gaze moves from the top of the painting to the bottom, and only then does he discover two embroidered shoes at the bottom, realizing that it isn't Guanyin. He sings, "I only see two golden lotus petals dragging beneath her skirt," moving his hands slightly back and forth to indicate the appearance of the exposed embroidered shoes. The expression of doubt on his face deepens. He wonders if it could be the Goddess Chang'e. He looks at the painting again, but still can't guess correctly. He sings, "I don't see even half a wisp of auspicious cloud." Behind the table, he uses cloud steps, extending both hands while moving his whole body slightly, changing to having the palms of both hands facing upwards in an undulating motion, to express the meaning of auspicious clouds. Deciding that it isn't Chang'e, he returns to his seat, his face slightly raised, his gaze slightly moving in a thoughtful manner. He recites, "If it isn't Guanyin, and it isn't Chang'e, could it be a woman of the mortal realm?" Then he laughs "Hahaha" three times. He then sings, "This painting is strange, making it hard to guess and imitate." He stands up, walks outside the table, his eyes slightly closed, one hand touching his head, one hand stroking his chest, then both hands behind his back, his head slightly swaying as he walks, acting thoughtful. He walks to the right side of the table, carefully looks at the painting, and discovers tiny words. Why does he only discover them now? First, because the woman's handwriting is small, and he didn't notice it before. Second, because the handwriting has become blurred after being discarded for so long. He hurriedly sits down to look again, reciting, "Seen up close, she clearly seems proper and upright, seen from afar, she is free and at ease like a flying immortal. If in the future I can be a guest near the Toad Palace, I won't be by the plum tree, but by the willow tree." Upon reciting the last line, he is certain that she is a woman of the mortal realm, and joy appears on his face, making a "tsk, tsk" sound, laughing at himself for guessing so long. He then recalls the phrase "not by the plum tree, but by the willow tree" in the poem, which makes him suspicious and thoughtful again. He sings the melody "Jixian Bin," "How can I get close to the Toad Palace? I fear being separated by the Milky Way." When singing, he starts slowly and then speeds up, his eyes looking at the sky, sitting, his hands making pointing gestures. Because the movements on the stage have both movement and stillness, he should strengthen his facial expressions at this time, and his gaze should particularly focus on the person in the painting. He recites, "Ah, beautiful woman, I think you have such a good appearance, I fear you don't have a good match." He sings, "Why go to the willow and plum trees to seek results?" making gestures with both hands to symbolize the shapes of willow and plum trees, his eyes slightly widening, thinking that it has something to do with his name, his face showing particular joy. He recites, "Thinking that there are quite a few people in the world with the surnames Liu and Mei, but it just so happens that I am called Liu Mengmei. Speaking of which, I have a part by the plum tree, and I also have a part by the willow tree." He sings, "Delighted that the plum and willow trees are in harmony with me," lightly patting his body and swaying slightly, his head swaying along, expressing great pride. From then on, he feels that this painting is connected to him, and he looks at it more intently. Suddenly, he makes a surprised expression, finding the person in the painting's face very familiar, but he can't remember where he met her, his face showing a reminiscing expression, his gaze staring straight ahead, expressing self-hatred for his poor memory. He hits his head once with his right hand, singing, "I am surprised and unsure, where have I met her before?" He stands up and slowly paces, slightly twisting his hands, expressing a slightly anxious emotion because he can't remember. He walks to the right side of the table again and looks at the painting, his body straightening, his eyes turning, his head raised, making a shape of remembering. He thinks that he once had a dream, going to a large garden, with a plum tree, a beauty standing under the tree, exactly the person in the painting. She also said, "Liu Sheng, Liu Sheng, I have a predestined relationship with you, a time of discovery." So he moves forward, leaning towards the painting, and asks, "Did you say these words?" Seeing that she doesn't speak, he asks three times in a row, each time he asks, his body gets closer to the painting. Seeing that she still doesn't answer, he makes a "yo" sound, with a sense of complaint. But then he immediately changes to a smiling face, fearing that the beauty is displeased, and expresses to her that he is asking her to answer, singing, "Don't be offended, perhaps it was really in a dream," showing that he is certain that he met her in a dream. When he finishes singing, he nods to the painting, his gaze focused, making a friendly questioning expression. At this time, seeing that the person in the painting still doesn't answer, he further recognizes her in detail, and discovers that she is holding a green plum in her hand, and he also has the surname Mei, further confirming that she has a relationship with him. He sings the melody "Ying Ti Yu Lin," "She gently sings a poem with a green plum in hand, teasing a bit of spring heart," pointing with both fingers at the painting, then rubbing his hands together, expressing his rippling emotions. These two lines of singing sometimes use clear and crisp high notes, and sometimes should be delicate and lingering. He sings, "Little one is waiting to satisfy hunger with a painted cake, Miss seems to be quenching thirst by looking at plums," making an imagined manic state. (To be continued)

    谈“拾画叫画”的表演
    白云生
    下面再谈“叫画”。
    柳梦梅进了书房后，慢慢转身，步法轻软些，坐下用手扶桌，表示微有倦意。念白“待我细细展开一看，阿呀！好庄严法相也”，唱曲牌名“二郎神”，“能停妥，这慈容只合在莲花宝座”，眼神并不十分注意，但用双手分屈合掌作莲花式，变化到双手心向上做出佛相坐态，眼睛微闭。猛一睁眼，看到是个立像，唱“咦，为什么独立亭亭在梅柳左”，用左手水袖盖右手水袖，按桌里右角，左手折袖高举，右腿独立，左腿用靴尖挑袍边，全身随着微作上下起伏，表示亭亭玉立意。
    慢慢归到桌里左角，右手按桌角，作与上同样动作。唱“不栽紫竹林，边傍不放鹦哥”，脸上表示怀疑，慢慢坐下，而又想到观音身傍应当有紫竹林与鹦哥，用右手高举做出比划鹦哥姿式，左手斜下指画，眼神由画的上边看到下边，才发现下边有两只绣履，才知道不是观音。唱“只见两瓣金莲在裙下拖”，双手前后微动表示绣履露出姿态，面部怀疑的表情又进一步，想到莫非是尊嫦娥。又一看画，还是没猜对。唱“并不见祥云半朵”，在桌后用云步双手伸出随全身微动，变为双手心朝上做起伏状，表示祥云霭霭的意思。决定不是嫦娥，又归坐，面部微仰，眼神微动作思索状。念白“既不是观音，又不是嫦娥，难道是人间女子不成”。接着“哈哈哈”的笑了三声。接唱“这画跷蹊，教人难猜难摹”。立起身，走出桌外双眼微闭，一手摸头，一手抚心口，再双背手，随走头部随着微摆，作深思状，走到桌的右边，用眼细看画，发现有细小字迹。为什么这时才发现呢？一则女子笔迹细小，以前未注意到，二则弃置年久字迹也模糊了。急忙坐下再看，念“近睹分明似俨然，远观自在若飞仙，他年得傍蟾宫客，不在梅边在柳边”。念到末句，肯定是人间女子，面部现出喜悦，口中作啧啧声，自笑胡猜多时。再回想诗中“不在梅边在柳边”句，使自己又怀疑和思索。唱曲牌名“集贤宾”，“蟾宫那能得近它，怕隔断天河”。唱时先慢后快，眼睛看天空，坐着，双手做出指点状。因在舞台的动作上有动有静，此时应加强面部的表情，眼神要特别凝视画中人。念白“阿呀美人吓，想你有此好容貌，怕没个好对头”。唱“为甚傍柳依梅去寻结果”，双手左右做姿式比喻柳树和梅树的形态，双眼微展，想到与自己的名姓有关系，面部表现特别欢喜。念白“想天下姓柳姓梅的却也不少，偏偏是小生叫柳梦梅，论起来梅边小生有份，这柳边小生亦是有份的。唱“喜偏咱梅柳停和”，双手轻拍身子微晃，头部随之摇摆，表示非常得意，从此感觉这幅画与自己发生联系，更目不转睛地细看。忽然做出惊讶表情，发现画中人面貌很熟识，但又想不起在何处会过，面部做出回忆神情，眼神发直远看，表示自恨记忆力差，用右手击头部一下，唱“我惊疑未妥，似曾向何方会我”。立起身来徐踱，微捻双手，做出因想不起而有点急躁的情绪。又行至桌右边再看画，身子一挺，眼睛一转，头部一仰做出想起形状。想到曾做一梦，到一座大花园，有株梅树，树下立一美人，正是画中的人，她还说：“柳生柳生俺与你有姻缘之分，发迹之期”。所以移步俯身向画问“这话是不是你说的？”见她不言，故连问三声，每问一声，身子离画更近些。见她仍不答，便发“哟”声有怨怪之意。但随又立即转为笑脸，怕美人不悦，又向她表示请她答话，唱“你休见左，敢则是梦中真个”，表现出肯定是与她在梦中相会过。唱完时向画点头，眼神注视，做出亲切问话的神情。这时见画中人仍不回答，就更进一步的细细来认，又发现她手中执有青梅，自己又姓梅，更肯定和自己有关系。唱曲牌名“莺啼御林”，“她青梅在手诗细哦，逗春心一点蹉跎”，用双手指画后，双手互搓，表示情怀荡漾。这两句唱腔有时用清脆高腔，有时要细致缠绵。唱“小生待画饼充饥，小姐似望梅止渴”，作出想像中的狂态。（未完）
