    After Overfulfilling the First Quarter's Production Plan,
    National Coal Mines Must Strengthen Tunneling and Focus on Safety
    (Our newspaper reports) State-owned and joint state-private coal mines under the Ministry of Coal Industry overfulfilled the first quarter's production plan by 1.53% ahead of schedule. Including the coal produced during the Spring Festival, the total increase in raw coal for the entire quarter was nearly 700,000 tons. Compared with the same period last year, the average daily output of mines across the country increased by more than 12%. Units with relatively large surpluses include the Jingxi, Kailuan, Fushun, Fengfeng, Fuxin, Yangquan, Huainan, Jiaozuo, and Xinwen Mining Bureaus.
    Although the first quarter's production plan was completed very well, there are still some problems in tunneling and safety. The tunneling task was not completed well. From January 1 to March 20, the total footage plan was only 95.38% completed, of which the main roadway plan was only 87.17% completed. In this way, although raw coal production exceeded the plan month by month, the tunneling speed could not keep up, which would inevitably affect the decline in the level of raw coal production. The safety situation is also not good. The number of accidents in the first quarter of this year increased by 9.25% compared with the same period last year. During the Spring Festival, some mechanical equipment and underground engineering that should have been overhauled were not overhauled on time, resulting in more electromechanical accidents and roof and wall accidents after the Spring Festival than before.
    In order to comprehensively and safely complete this year's raw coal production plan, the Ministry of Coal Industry emphasized in its production work instructions for the second quarter: production must ensure safety and ensure quality; and it requires that on the basis of making good preparations, strengthening tunneling work, and establishing normal production order, potential must be tapped and efforts must be made to increase production.

    在超额完成第一季度产量计划以后
    全国煤矿必须加强掘进注重安全
    本报讯　煤炭工业部所属国营和公私合营煤矿，超额1.53％提前完成了第一季度产量计划。加上春节增产的原煤，全季共增产原煤近七十万吨。与去年同期比较，全国各矿平均日产量增长12％以上。超额较多的单位有京西、开滦、抚顺、峰峰、阜新、阳泉、淮南、焦作、新汶等矿务局。
    第一季度的产量计划虽然完成很好，但是在掘进和安全方面还有一些问题。掘进任务完成得不好。从1月1日至3月20日总进尺计划完成95.38％，其中主要巷道计划仅完成87.17％，这样，原煤生产虽然逐月超额，而掘进速度不能跟上去，必然要影响到原煤生产水平的下降。安全情况也不够好，今年第一季度发生的事故比去年同期增加了9.25％。春节期间有些该检修的机械设备和井巷工程没有按时检修，以致春节以后，机电事故和顶帮事故较前增多。
    为了全面地安全地完成今年的原煤生产计划，煤炭工业部在第二季度的生产工作指示中，着重指出：生产必须保证安全，保证质量；并要求在作好准备，加强掘进工作和建立正常生产秩序的基础上，发掘潜力，努力增产。　　　　　　　（丘曾金）
