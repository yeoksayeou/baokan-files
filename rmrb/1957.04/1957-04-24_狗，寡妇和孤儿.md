    Dogs, Widows and Orphans
    The French newspaper "l'Humanité" published an illustration titled "Dogs, Widows and Orphans." It said: To raise a well-trained military dog for "hunting Algerians," the government needs 1,500 francs per day. However, the Mollet government only pays 392 francs per day to widows of French patriots who sacrificed themselves in the anti-fascist struggle, and orphans only get 70 francs per day.

    狗，寡妇和孤儿
    法国“人道报”登载了一幅插图，标题是“狗，寡妇和孤儿”。里面说：为了饲养一条教练好的“猎捕阿尔及利亚人”的军用犬，政府每天需用一千五百法郎。但摩勒政府对在反法西斯主义斗争中牺牲的法国爱国者的寡妇每日却只付三百九十二法郎，孤儿一天只有七十法郎。（附图片）
