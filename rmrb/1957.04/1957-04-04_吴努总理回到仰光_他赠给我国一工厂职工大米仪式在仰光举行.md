Accompanying Premier U Nu back here were Daw Khin Kyi, wife of Aung San, Burmese Ambassador to China U Hla Maung, and Chinese Ambassador to Burma Yao Zhongming.

At the airport, U Nu told reporters that the Governor of Yunnan Province, the Commander of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Kunming, and a Yunnan cultural delegation will visit Burma in April to celebrate the Water Splashing Festival with the Burmese people.

Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, April 3rd: U Ba Khin, Director of the State Agricultural Marketing Board of the Union of Burma, today handed over 50 tons of Burmese rice to Chinese Ambassador to Burma Yao Zhongming. This rice is a gift from Burmese Premier U Nu to the workers of the state-owned Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory in China.

The donation ceremony was held this morning on board the Polish ship transporting the rice to China.

U Ba Khin said at the ceremony that this batch of rice is not large in quantity, but Premier U Nu's feelings are very deep. He believes that this feeling will help strengthen the friendship between the two countries.

Yao Zhongming said that the workers of the state-owned Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory will be very excited and happy when they receive the rice donated by Premier U Nu. This gift demonstrates the lofty friendship of Premier U Nu and the Burmese government towards them. Yao Zhongming then read out a letter of thanks from the workers of the state-owned Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory.

This batch of rice was announced by U Nu, Chairman of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League of Burma, as a gift to the workers of the state-owned Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory during his visit to Tianjin last October. At that time, the state-owned Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory was manufacturing textile machinery for Burma. This textile machinery is designed and manufactured according to the characteristics of Burmese cotton fiber and has now been delivered here and will be installed in the second half of this year.
