Character Introduction:

    Murderer Speidel

    Hans Speidel, who was appointed commander of the Central European ground forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in January of this year, is a heinous Nazi war criminal.

    He was born in Waldenburg, Germany on October 28, 1897. During the First World War, he served as an officer in the German army for four years. In 1925, he obtained a doctorate in philosophy, and in 1930 he held an important position in the French division of the German General Staff. In 1933, he served as assistant military attache at the Hitler's German Embassy in France, and then returned to General Bock's intelligence organization to serve as the head of the so-called "Western Foreign Armies" section. Thus, Speidel became one of the commanders of the Nazi army and an important organizer of the "Fifth Column."

    During the Second World War, he led the Nazi army into France. When the French traitorous government of Petain surrendered in 1940, he represented Hitler's Germany in signing the surrender document. He served as the chief of staff of the Nazi military headquarters occupying France, massacred people everywhere in France, and sent tens of thousands of French patriots and peaceful residents to concentration camps.

    After Hitler launched an attack on the Soviet Union, he became one of the commanders of the Nazi army's invasion of Ukraine and the attacks on Moscow and Stalingrad. In 1944, during the Nazi army's invasion of North Africa, Speidel also served as Chief of Staff to Marshal Rommel. This Nazi butcher, whose hands were stained with the blood of the people of Europe and Africa, was sentenced to death by the Nuremberg Military Tribunal, but under the protection of the United States, he was actually pardoned in 1951, and immediately served as the head of the Armed Forces Department of the West German Ministry of Defense, and represented West Germany at the European Defense Group and North Atlantic Treaty Organization meetings.

    杀人犯斯派达尔
    今年1月被任命为北大西洋公约组织中欧地面部队司令的汉斯·斯派达尔，是一名罪大恶极的纳粹战犯。
    他于1897年10月28日生于德国瓦登堡。第一次世界大战时，他就曾在德国军队中当过四年的军官，1925年获得了哲学博士的学位，1930年又在德军总参谋部法国处担任要职。1933年任希特勒德国驻法大使馆的助理武官，然后回到纳粹将军伯克的谍报组织中担任所谓“西方外国军队”科科长。就这样，斯派达尔成了纳粹军队的指挥者之一和“第五纵队”的重要组织者。
    第二次世界大战时，他率领纳粹军队攻入法国，1940年法国贝当卖国政府投降时，他代表希特勒德国在受降书上签字，担任占领法国的纳粹军司令部参谋长，在法国各地大肆屠杀，并把成千上万的法国爱国志士和和平居民押送到集中营。
    希特勒发动进攻苏联后，他成了纳粹军队侵入乌克兰和进攻莫斯科和斯大林格勒的指挥者之一。1944年在纳粹军队侵略北非的战役中，斯派达尔又担任了隆美尔元帅的参谋长。这一个双手沾满了欧洲和非洲人民的鲜血的纳粹屠夫，曾被纽伦堡军事法庭判处死刑，但在美国的庇护下，他居然于1951年被赦免，并随即担任西德国防部武装部队处处长，并代表西德出席过欧洲防务集团和北大西洋公约组织会议。（国）（附图片）
