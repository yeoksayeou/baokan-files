Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The Ministry of Finance has decided to continue to exempt state-owned agricultural tractor stations' income from cultivating land on behalf of others from business tax in 1957.

At present, the vast majority of China's state-owned agricultural tractor stations are still public institutions and have not yet been transformed into enterprise management. The fees charged by these tractor stations for cultivating land on behalf of agricultural cooperatives and farmers are quite low, generally not even covering the costs. Therefore, in order to coordinate with the promotion of agricultural machine耕作 in taxation, and to take care of the development of agricultural tractor stations and the burden of agricultural cooperatives and farmers using tractors for cultivation, the Ministry of Finance has recently made this decision.

    财政部决定
    拖拉机站免征营业税
    新华社3日讯　财政部决定在1957年内对国营农业拖拉机站代耕田地的收入继续免纳营业税。
    我国国营农业拖拉机站目前绝大部分还是事业单位，尚未转为企业化经营，这些拖拉机站为农业社、农民代耕田地所收的费用，相当低廉，一般都还不够成本。因此财政部为了在税收上配合农业机器耕作的推广，照顾农业拖拉机站的发展和农业社、农民使用拖拉机耕作的负担，在最近作出了这项决定。
