A solemn farewell ceremony was held at the airport.

Then, Premier Široký delivered a farewell speech to the thousands of people who came to see them off (see page four). On behalf of all the members of the delegation, he expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese people for their warm reception and for the brotherly friendship they had shown them. He said: We have spent nearly three weeks in your midst, and throughout this time, we have felt sincere sympathy and thoughtful hospitality everywhere.
