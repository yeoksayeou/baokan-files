Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 5th: Former Kuomintang military and political personnel working in the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee Counselor's Office are living very happily.

Of the 286 staff members in the Guangdong Provincial People's Committee Counselor's Office, the vast majority are former Kuomintang military and political personnel, including former Kuomintang army major generals, lieutenant generals, and generals, as well as those who served as commissioners and provincial governors in the Kuomintang government. Over the past few years, they have played an active role in various tasks. They frequently join representatives of the Provincial People's Congress and members of the CPPCC in inspecting government work throughout the province, promptly reflecting experiences and shortcomings in the work. Chen Zhuofan, who served as an administrative commissioner in the Kuomintang government, and Xiao Wen, former lieutenant general and chief of staff of the Kuomintang Expeditionary Force, are now both deputy directors of the Provincial Counselor's Office. After inspecting government work in more than ten counties last year, they put forward specific suggestions for improvement regarding the supply of non-staple foods and commercial work, which were valued by relevant departments.

Many are actively studying Marxism-Leninism. Some are also engaged in academic research. Huang Kaishan, who once served as the Kuomintang county magistrate of Qingyuan County and the mayor of Shantou City, and Liang Shiji, former Kuomintang lieutenant general and deputy army commander, are currently systematically studying the works of Marx and Lenin. Yu Zuobo, former chairman of the Kuomintang Guangxi Province, who has studied Chinese medicine for decades, is now preparing to organize his experience in using traditional Chinese medicine to treat hypertension and pain syndromes.

Every weekend and holiday, some invite close friends to chat at home; others take their wives and children to parks and scenic spots for outings. They also often watch Cantonese opera and Peking opera, which they love. At the twice-monthly evening parties held by the Provincial Counselor's Office, one can often see them performing Peking opera, Cantonese opera, and Han opera, or reciting old-style poems they have created themselves.

    根据自己的兴趣和专长积极工作学习
    广东参事室前国民党军政人员生活愉快
    据新华社广州5日电　在广东省人民委员会参事室工作的前国民党军政人员生活得很愉快。
    广东省人民委员会参事室的二百八十六位工作人员中，绝大部分是前国民党军政人员，其中有前国民党军队的少将、中将、上将，也有担任过国民党政府的专员和省主席的。几年来，他们在各项工作中都发挥了积极的作用。他们经常和省人民代表大会代表、政协委员一起到全省各地检查政府工作，及时反映工作中的经验和缺点。曾在国民党政府做过行政专员的陈卓凡和前国民党远征军中将参谋长萧文，现在都是省参事室副主任。他们去年在十多个县检查了政府工作以后，对于副食品供应和商业工作提出了具体的改进意见，受到有关部门的重视。
    很多人在积极地学习马克思列宁主义。有的还从事学术研究工作。曾经担任过国民党清远县县长、汕头市市长的黄开山和前国民党中将副军长梁世骥，目前正在系统地研究马克思、列宁的著作。前国民党广西省主席俞作柏，曾经研究了几十年中国医学，现在他正准备整理他用中医治疗高血压和痛症的经验。
    每到周末和假日，他们有的邀请知己在家叙谈；有的带着妻子儿女到公园和名胜地方游玩。他们也经常观看自己所爱好的粤剧、京剧。在省参事室每月举行的两次晚会上，常常可以看到他们表演的京戏、粤曲、汉剧，或朗诵他们自己创作的旧体诗词。
