Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 27th: Asanuma Inejirō, head of the Japan Socialist Party's goodwill mission to China, issued a statement at Tokyo Airport yesterday evening, saying that the Socialist Party's mission is prepared to launch a broad mass movement to strive for the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations after explaining the achievements of the mission's visit to China to the people.

In his statement, Asanuma also pointed out that the time has come for the Chinese and Japanese governments to handle the issue of restoring Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations.

At a press conference held later, Asanuma firmly denied the Japanese government and ruling party's accusation that his delegation had gone "too far" in its discussions with Chinese leaders and in issuing a joint statement. He said that his delegation conducted talks based on the principles of the opposition party.

Asanuma also explained to reporters some of the issues that his delegation discussed with Chinese leaders in Beijing. He said that the delegation told the Chinese leaders that the Taiwan issue should be resolved as an internal affair of China. China is very confident in resolving the Taiwan issue.

When talking about his impressions of his visit to China, Asanuma said that China, which has already resolved the class struggle issue, is now beginning to fight against nature, is committed to greening campaigns throughout the country, and is building sluices and erecting iron bridges on the Yellow River and the Yangtze River. In academic and cultural fields, in order to enable more people to play a role, the "Hundred Schools of Thought" issue is being discussed.

    浅沼回东京后发表声明
    准备动员全国争取日中建交
    新华社27日讯　东京消息：日本社会党访华亲善使节团团长浅沼稻次郎昨天晚间在东京机场上发表声明说，社会党的使节团准备在向人民解释了使节团访问中国的成果以后，发动一个广泛的争取恢复日中邦交的群众运动。
    浅沼在声明中还指出，日中两国政府处理恢复日中邦交问题的时机已经到来了。
    浅沼在后来举行的记者招待会上，表示坚决不承认日本政府和执政党这样的指责：他的代表团在同中国领袖们的讨论中以及在发表共同声明时做得“太过分了”。他说，他的使节团本着在野党的原则进行了会谈。
    浅沼还向记者们说明了他的使节团在北京同中国领袖们讨论的一些问题。他说，使节团对中国领袖们说，台湾问题应该作为中国的内政问题来解决。中国对解决台湾问题很有信心。
    浅沼谈到访问中国的观感时说，已经解决了阶级斗争问题的中国，现在正在开始同大自然进行斗争，正在全国各地致力于绿化运动，在黄河和长江兴建水闸、架设铁桥。在学术文化方面为了使更多的人发挥作用，正在讨论“百家争鸣”问题。
