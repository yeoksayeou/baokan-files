Xinhua News Agency, London, 6th: The activities of the Port of London were almost completely paralyzed on the 5th, with seventy-five fully loaded ships quietly docked in the harbor. This is the result of a strike by more than a thousand statisticians in the Port of London. Because the statisticians are not working, dockworkers and stevedores cannot unload cargo from the ships.

The statisticians of the Port of London are striking in solidarity with their colleagues at the Tilbury Docks on the Thames. The Tilbury Docks statisticians have been on strike for several days in opposition to business owners infringing upon union rights.

    千名统计员罢工  伦敦港陷于瘫痪
    新华社6日讯　伦敦消息：5日，伦敦港的活动几乎全部瘫痪，七十五艘满载货物的轮船静悄悄地停泊在港口里。这是伦敦港一千多个统计员罢工的结果。因为统计员不工作，码头工人和搬运工人就无法从轮船上卸货。
    伦敦港的统计员是为了声援他们在泰晤士河蒂尔伯利码头的同行而举行罢工的。蒂尔伯利码头统计员因为反对企业主侵害工会权利，已经罢工好几天了。
