    A Song Constantly Stirred in My Heart
    Yan Chen
    "Our motherland is so vast and wide,
    She has countless fields and forests;
    We have never seen another country,
    That can breathe so freely. ..."
    When our motherland was still in the dark ages, this song – "Motherland March" – was deeply loved by me. Not only because of its bright melody, but also because the glorious ideal land it sang about attracted our hearts like a magnet. I am not good at singing, but I still sang it ten times, a hundred times, when I couldn't sing it out loud, I sang it softly, I sang it silently. This song, ah, constantly stirred in my heart.
    Today, the motherland is liberated, and we can not only "breathe freely" but also create the kind of beautiful life praised in the song.
    When I embarked on the journey to visit the Soviet Union, the longing in my heart was indescribable. Being closer to the glorious land made me even more eager to take a closer look at her and stretch out my arms to embrace her tightly as if to a mother.
    The Soviet Union, the land I had longed for so long, my wish was finally realized.
    It should be said that I am not unfamiliar with her. In literary works, in songs, on the screen, in pictures, ... we have breathed with her. We walked in the ranks of the masses in front of Red Square, we endured the days and nights of Stalingrad with the Red Army soldiers, we were happy that Davydov finally established the first collective farm, and we shed tears for Zoya's heroic behavior. ...
    But seeing her with our own eyes made us feel more closely, and our impressions were more profound. What I will never forget is her vastness, her richness and magnificence, her advanced system, her brilliant construction, her splendid culture, and the diligence, bravery, and wisdom of her people. In addition to these, what I will never forget is her concern for us and the friendly feelings towards the Chinese people. In that atmosphere, I thought of an old saying of ours: Guests feel at home.
    I once wandered in the hall of Moscow University, identifying the images of Soviet and world scientists one by one on those murals. When I saw the images of our ancient Chinese scientists Zu Chongzhi and Li Shizhen, my heart could not be calm for a long time. At night, I climbed up Lenin Hills, looked up at Moscow University, the windows shining with thousands of lights, side by side with the stars in the sky. I know that there are many Chinese youths studying under these lights. Staring for a long time, I envied and yearned.
    We visited the Tbilisi Children's Palace, and the host introduced that there is a Chinese literature group here. In the past, a teenager loved Bai Juyi's poems. When the teenager grew up, he finally translated Bai Juyi's poems into Georgian and published them. We did not see this translator, but from many other teenagers, we saw the same aspirations as him.
    At the Leningrad Writers' Association, among the gifts we received was a selection of Du Fu's poems translated by Gitovich. We were unable to meet Comrade Gitovich, he was ill, but he specially asked his wife to attend the symposium to express his friendship to Chinese friends.
    The department store in Moscow is a bit like the Dong'an Market in Beijing. On New Year's Eve, people are particularly crowded. We were dazzled like entering the Grand View Garden. Suddenly, a girl rushed up from behind and asked us what color clothes the girls in Chinese rural areas like. The girl's mother explained to her that she was going to dress up as a Chinese rural girl at the New Year's Eve party, but after picking out fabrics for a long time, she didn't know what color was suitable. She got the answer and thanked us with satisfaction. We didn't have time to ask her name, but we could fully understand her intentions and her happiness.
    In the cultural palace of the Tashkent Joint Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory, the painting studio was full of male and female workers, they were painting and sculpting. - You know, before the revolution, only 2% of the population of Uzbekistan was literate. Here, we met an old lady named Irifaguva, who was sixty-six years old, had worked as a textile worker for thirty years, and is now deaf and retired. However, she is not satisfied with sunbathing and warming the stove. In 1951, she began to learn painting and sculpting. We saw many of her works and were amazed by her excellent artistic creation.
    Many of her works are sculptures of Chinese people, Chinese girls, one is "Friendship between Uzbekistan and China". She grew up in Xinjiang when she was young. When she sculpted Chinese people, she mainly relied on the impressions she had seen in the past. She always regretted not being able to collect more information about China. We sent her a few landscape postcards, and she happily held our hands for a long time.
    Sincere friendship is everywhere. Sometimes, it can be exchanged and understood without using language as a medium.
    We flew from Tashkent to Moscow. Below the plane was a sea of clouds, stretching into the distance. Above, the sky was azure blue, and the sunlight shone on the sea of clouds, shining with golden colors. A lieutenant colonel sitting next to me kept exclaiming at the beautiful scenery: "Oh my! Oh my!" He said something to me, and when he realized I wasn't Uzbek, he suddenly woke up and shouted: "Chinese! Chinese!"
    Then, he told his partner about this discovery and busily brought over two Russian versions of "People's China". He pointed to the photos of Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou on the publications and said: Good! Good! The many things he wanted to say, his deep friendship, seemed to be expressed in this simple word.
    Once again, we took a car from Sochi to Lake Riga. The car advanced along the mountain road on the Black Sea coast. The driver, Comrade Zakharinko, gave us directions and introductions along the way, becoming our good guide. There was a long and winding road, and he said that the road was called "Mother-in-law's Tongue". After a while, he pointed to the spring water seeping out of the rocks and said that it was called "Girl's Tears".
    Zakharinko is over forty years old. He spends most of his time driving cars. It can be said that he is a person who travels all year round. His kind of travel life is tense and dull, but he has found humor and fun in it. He is the kind of person who opens his throat and tells you all his thoughts.
    In 1937, in the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan in our country, Comrade Zakharinko drove large trucks full of supplies from Almaty to Xi'an several times. What kind of road was that? It was rugged and uneven, not to mention that it had to pass through deserts and long, uninhabited places. He had to bring his own dry food and water and sleep under the car, arriving at his destination after more than a month.
    At that time, perhaps humor and fun could not alleviate the hardships and loneliness of the long journey. However, for the sake of friendship and to support the just struggle of the Chinese people, he was willing to endure this hardship and loneliness. Now, when he talks about these things, he is still full of a sense of glory, and we are even more respectful of him.
    We had more contact with Soviet writers and received their warm care wherever we went, and we became friends at first sight.
    Dawn was approaching, cold and sleepy, our train arrived in Tbilisi. Greeting us at the station were Comrade Leonyedze, Chairman of the Georgian Writers' Association, poet, and other comrades. Comrade Leonyedze is already fifty-seven years old, with graying hair. He is very busy at work, but in order to welcome us, he was afraid of missing the time, so he stayed up all night, no, he wrote poems all night. It was really embarrassing to have such an elder wait for us, but he was very excited as if he had met relatives from afar who had been separated for a long time.
    Back at the hotel, as soon as we entered the door, he introduced us endlessly, starting from the fact that Chekhov and Gorky had lived in this hotel, to the heroic and unyielding history of struggle in Georgia, its special customs, and the famous wines of various varieties. Then, he led us to the Writers' Association, where a room was full of colleagues, men and women, many of whom were already gray-haired. How could you not be moved in front of these elders?
    On the night of our departure from Tbilisi, according to Georgian custom, we drank cup after cup of wine with silver-rimmed ox horn cups, and the hosts and hostesses sang folk songs one after another. The night was late, and the comrades insisted on seeing us off. On the platform, they embraced and kissed us again and again, a hot tear dripped on my cheek, and an electric current ran through my whole body. The train started, and Comrade Leonyedze repeatedly urged: "Say hello to the Chinese writers, they are my brothers and sisters!"
    Many Soviet writers participated in the Great Patriotic War. When the motherland was threatened, they took up their guns. When the war ended, they took up their pens, which were as sharp as guns.
    In Kiev, the comrades who accompanied us had all fought through life and death. Comrade Prutlatsky, Director of the Foreign Literature Committee of the Ukrainian Writers' Association, worked as a correspondent during the war and often flew to deliver intelligence. Novelist Kravchenko defended Stalingrad and later fought all the way to Berlin. Comrade Avtomanov, the author of "In the Kuliangya Encirclement", was a telegraph operator, parachuting behind enemy lines three times, and was surrounded for nine months in Latvia the last time. Zbanatsky, the author of "The Secret of Sokolson Forest", was a guerrilla captain during the war and a Gold Star Hero. His mother was killed by Hitler's bandits, and his fourteen-year-old brother was hanged. This was an irreconcilable hatred, how could he not be brave!
    Zbanatsky had been to China and participated in the Franco Commemoration. After returning, he loved to talk about China constantly. He invited us to his home as guests, and his wife specially made roast duck for us. He used the bamboo chopsticks he brought back from China for the first time. This night, Zbanatsky was like a festival, wearing the Gold Star Hero medal on his chest. Prutlatsky and Kravchenko also came to spend the night together.
    This was like a reunion party. Zbanatsky talked about his impressions of China. He was introducing it to the other two comrades who had not been to China, but in fact, he was also indulging himself in beautiful memories once again. Although we had been away from our motherland for a short time, we always felt sweet in our hearts when we thought of her. They also talked about their experiences in the Great Patriotic War, and some of our comrades had also participated in the War of Liberation. Therefore, we became close brothers, as if we had been in the same trench.
    "Here, it should be said that there are four Chinese. In addition to the three guests, I am the fourth Chinese," Zbanatsky said.
    "You were a guerrilla captain, and I was a guerrilla fighter. If needed, as long as the captain gives an order, I will bravely rush forward!" one of our comrades said. ...
    Deep brotherly friendship, like a hot spring, permeated us, like a spring breeze, blew on us, and many scenes can never be forgotten. I don't know how to express my gratitude and endless joy, I just want to sing, and naturally sang again:
    "... We can walk around freely,
    Like the masters of our own country!"
    Yes, there, just like in the motherland, I didn't feel like I was in a foreign country at all. Yes, that is the country we have longed for for a long time.

### 一支歌常在我心中激荡

    一支歌常在我心中激荡
    严辰
    “我们祖国多么辽阔广大，
    她有无数田野和森林；
    我们没有见过别的国家，
    可以这样自由呼吸。……”
    当我们祖国还在黑暗的年代，这支歌——“祖国进行曲”就为我深深喜爱。不仅仅由于它明快的旋律，更由于它歌唱的那个光辉的理想的国土，磁石一样吸引着我们的心。我不善于唱歌，可是仍然十遍百遍的唱着它，不能放声高歌的时候，就低低地唱着它，默默地唱着它。这歌呵，常在我心中激荡。
    今天，祖国解放了，我们不但可以“自由呼吸”，还在创造着歌中赞颂的那种美好的生活。
    当我踏上访苏的路程时，向往的心情是难以描述的，距离光辉的国土更近了，就更迫切的想仔细地看看她，伸出臂膀来，像对母亲一样的紧紧地拥抱她。
    苏联，我所长久向往的国土，我的愿望终于实现了。
    应该说，我对她并不是陌生的。在文学作品里，在歌曲里，在银幕上，在画面上，……我们曾经和她一同呼吸过。我们随着群众的行列从红场前面走过，我们和红军战士一起熬过斯大林格勒的日日夜夜，我们为达维多夫终于建立了第一个集体农庄而高兴，我们为卓娅的英勇行为掉下眼泪。……
    可是亲眼看到她时，我们感觉得更贴切，我们的印象就更深刻。使我难以忘怀的，是她的辽阔广大，她的富饶和壮丽，她的先进的制度，辉煌的建设，灿烂的文化，人们的勤劳、勇敢和智慧。除了这些，使我难以忘怀的，还有对我们的关切，对中国人民友好的情谊。在那样的气氛里，我想起了我们的一句老话：宾至如归。
    我曾经徘徊在莫斯科大学的大厅里，从那些壁画上，一一辨认过苏联的、世界的科学家的图像。当我看到我国古代科学家祖冲之和李时珍的像时，心里好久不能平静。夜晚，我爬上列宁山，仰望莫斯科大学，窗户里闪亮着千万盏灯光，和天空的星群并列。我知道，有不少中国的青年，正在这灯光下钻研。久久地凝视着，我艳羡，我神往。
    我们参观第比利斯的少年宫，主人介绍说，这里有一个中国文学小组，过去有一个少年喜爱白居易的诗，少年长大了，他终于把白居易的诗译成格鲁吉亚文出版了。我们没有看到这位译者，可是从另外许多少年身上，看到了和他同样的志愿。
    在列宁格勒作家协会，我们收到的礼物中，有着吉托维奇翻译的杜甫诗选。我们没有能见到吉托维奇同志，他病了，但是他特地请他的夫人来出席座谈会，表示他对中国朋友的情谊。
    莫斯科的百货公司，有点像北京的东安市场，新年前夕，人们特别拥挤。我们像进大观园一样弄得眼花撩乱，突然后面赶上来一位少女，问我们中国农村的姑娘，喜欢什么颜色的衣服。少女的母亲替她解释，她准备新年晚会上化装中国的农村姑娘，可是挑了半天衣料，不知道什么颜色合适。她得到了回答，满意地称谢而去。我们没有来得及问她名字，可是，她的心意，她的快乐，我们是完全可以领会的。
    在塔什干的联合纺织印染工厂的文化宫，画室里坐满了男工和女工，他们正在画画，在雕塑。——要知道，在革命前，乌兹别克识字的人才占人口2％。在这里，我们认识了一位老太太，她叫伊里伐古娃，已经六十六岁，做过三十年纺织工人，现在耳朵聋了，退休养老。可是，她并不满足于晒晒太阳、烤烤火炉过日子，1951年，她开始学画，学雕塑。我们看到她不少作品，为她的出色的艺术创造而惊异。
    她的作品中有不少是雕塑的中国人，中国女孩，有一座是“乌兹别克和中国的友谊”。她幼年生长在新疆，雕塑中国人时，主要凭过去见到的印象，她总以未能搜集更多有关中国的资料为憾。我们送了她几张风景画片，她欢喜得久久地握着我们的手不放。
    真诚的友谊，无处不在。有时不靠语言做媒介，也一样可以交流，可以互相了解。
    我们从塔什干往莫斯科飞行，飞机下面是一片云海，铺展到远方。上面天空碧蓝，阳光照在云海上，闪耀着金亮的颜色。坐在我旁边的一位中校，不断地为这美丽的景色发出赞叹：“哎哟哟！哎哟哟！”他对我说着什么，发现我不是乌兹别克人，顿然醒悟了似的喊：“中国人！中国人！”
    接着，他把这发现告诉他的伙伴，又忙着从那里找来了两本俄文版的“人民中国”，他指着刊物上毛主席和周总理的照片，说着：好！好！他想说的许多话，他的深厚的情谊，仿佛都在这个简单的字里表现出来了。
    又一次，我们从索契坐汽车往里加湖去，车沿着黑海边的山道前进，司机扎哈林柯同志一路指点介绍，成了我们很好的向导。有一段路长而曲折，他说，这路名叫“丈母娘的舌头”。一会儿又指着岩缝里渗出的泉滴，说这叫“姑娘的眼泪”。
    扎哈林柯四十多岁了，大部分的时间驾驶汽车，可以说，是长年在旅途奔波的人，他那种旅途生活是紧张而沉闷的，可是他却从中找到了幽默和风趣。他是这样一种人，张开了喉咙，就会把什么心事全吐露给你的。
    1937年，我国抗日战争初期，扎哈林柯同志曾驾驶着满载物资的大卡车，从阿拉木图几次去过西安。那会是什么样的道路呵，崎岖不平，这还不说，还要经过沙漠，经过漫长的荒无人烟的地方，他得自己带着干粮和水，露宿在汽车底下，走一个多月才到达目的地。
    那时，大概幽默和风趣，也不能减轻长途跋踄的艰苦和寂寞了。但是，为了友谊，为了支援中国人民正义的斗争，他甘于忍受这种艰苦和寂寞。现在，他说起这些的时候，还充满了光荣感，而我们呢，就对他更加尊敬。
    我们和苏联的作家接触得更多一些，到什么地方，都受到了他们热情的照顾，而且都一见如故。
    天将黎明，寒冷而困倦，我们的火车到达第比利斯。在车站上接我们的，是格鲁吉亚作家协会主席、诗人莱翁涅杰等同志。莱翁涅杰同志已经五十七岁，鬓发半白，他工作很忙，可是为了迎接我们，怕错过了时间，他通宵未睡，不，他写了一夜的诗。要这么一位长者等候我们，实在觉得过意不去，他呢，像见到了分别好久的远方亲戚一样，非常兴奋。
    回到旅馆，一走进门，他就滔滔不绝的为我们介绍，从当年契诃夫和高尔基住过这旅馆谈起，直到格鲁吉亚英勇不屈的斗争历史，特殊的风习，和品种繁多的著名的葡萄酒。然后，引我们去作家协会，在那里，坐满了一屋子同行，男的女的，不少人已白发苍苍，在这些长辈面前，你怎能不受感动。
    离别第比利斯的那夜，按照格鲁吉亚的习惯，我们用镶着银边的牛角杯，一杯又一杯的饮干了葡萄酒，主人和主妇，一支又一支的唱着民歌。夜已深了，同志们非送行不可。在站台上，一次又一次的拥抱亲吻我们，一滴热泪滴上我的脸颊，一支电流穿过了我的全身。列车开动了，莱翁涅杰同志还一再嘱托：“问中国作家们好，他们是我的兄弟姊妹！”
    苏联的作家，很多都参加过卫国战争。当祖国受到威胁的时候，他们拿起了枪，战争结束了，他们拿起了和枪一样锐利的笔。
    在基辅，陪伴我们的几位同志，都曾经出生入死地战斗过。乌克兰作家协会外国文学委员会主任普鲁特拉斯基同志，战时做过通讯员，经常坐着飞机传递情报。小说家克拉夫钦柯同志，坚守过斯大林格勒，以后直打到柏林。阿夫托玛诺夫同志，“在库良吉亚包围圈中”的作者，是报务员，三次空降敌后，最后一次在拉脱维亚，被包围九个月之久。兹巴纳茨基同志，“索柯尔松林的秘密”的作者，则是战时的游击队长，金星英雄。他的母亲为希特勒匪徒杀害，他的十四岁的弟弟被绞死，这是不共戴天的仇恨，他怎能不英勇！
    兹巴纳茨基曾来过中国，参加过弗兰科纪念会，回去以后，他爱不断地谈着中国。他邀我们到他家里去作客，他的夫人特地为我们做了烤鸭，他第一次启用了中国带回去的竹筷子。这一晚，兹巴纳茨基像过节一样，胸前挂着金星英雄章。普鲁特拉斯基和克拉夫钦柯也来共度良宵。
    这像是一个回忆晚会。兹巴纳茨基谈着对中国的印象，他是在向另两位没到过中国的同志介绍，其实也是让自己又一次在美好的回忆里沉醉。我们虽然离开祖国不久，想起她时，心里也总是甜滋滋的。他们又谈到了卫国战争中自己的经历，我们有的同志也参加过解放战争，于是，我们就像在一个战壕里呆过的人一样，成了亲密的兄弟。
    “在这里，应该说有四个中国人。除了三位客人，我是第四个中国人。”兹巴纳茨基说。
    “你做过游击队长，我做过游击队员，如果需要，只要队长一声命令，我就勇敢地冲上前去！”我们的一位同志说。……
    深厚的兄弟的情谊，像温泉一样浸淫着我们，像春风一样吹拂着我们，许多情景是永远不能忘记的。我不知道怎样来表示我的感谢，和无穷的快乐，我只是想唱歌，很自然的又唱起了：
    “……我们可以自由走来走去，
    好像自己祖国的主人！”
    是的，在那里，就像在祖国一样，我丝毫没有异乡的感觉。是的，那里就是我们长久向往的国度。
