Qinghai to Southern Xinjiang Railway Starts Preliminary Survey

(Our dispatch) The preliminary survey of the railway line from Maqên in Qinghai to Qiemo in southern Xinjiang has begun. This line passes through the rich Qaidam Basin, and most of the area along the way is sparsely populated desert. It will cross the Da Kenda Ban Mountain and Qilian Mountains, which are more than 3,800 meters above sea level. The terrain is high and steep, the climate is changeable, and the geological conditions are very complicated, making surveying difficult. In order to select an economical and reasonable route and to take into account the transportation of the Qaidam oil industrial area, the Qaidam Detachment of the Ministry of Railways has repeatedly conducted technical research based on existing data. At present, there are four major comparative plans for paper alignment, and the total amount of preliminary survey work is about 2,100 kilometers (the main line is about 800 kilometers).

    青海到南疆铁路开始草测
    本报讯　青海马恺到新疆南部的婼羌铁路线开始草测，这条线路经过富庶的柴达木盆地，沿途大多是人烟稀少的沙漠，要穿过拔海三千八百多公尺的大肯大板山和祁连山，地势高峻，气候变化无常，地质情况非常复杂，勘测起来困难很多。为了选择经济合理的线路，以及照顾柴达木石油工业区的运输，铁道部柴达木派遣总队根据现有资料，反复作了技术研究，目前纸上定线有四条大的比较方案，总的草测工作量约有二千一百多公里（正线约八百公里）。
