Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 25th: Chairman Voroshilov made friends with the joyful citizens of Hangzhou at West Lake this afternoon.

At 2:45 p.m., Chairman Voroshilov boarded a yacht at Xiling Bridge. Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei, and the party and government leaders of Zhejiang Province and Hangzhou City accompanied him on a boat tour.

When the distinguished guests landed at places such as Three Pools Mirroring the Moon and Huxinting (Mid-lake Pavilion), they met many tourists. A group of students from Zhejiang Medical College gave a large red envelope to Premier Zhou, which turned out to be a silk woven portrait of Chairman Mao Zedong for Chairman Voroshilov. Chairman Voroshilov said happily, "This is the best gift I have received."

The ship carrying Chairman Voroshilov slowly sailed around Su Causeway, and nearly a thousand young people cheered and laughed on the dike, running along with the direction of the ship. Chairman Voroshilov sang softly and waved to the crowd on the dike from time to time.

After boating on the lake, the distinguished guests visited the Du Jinsheng Silk Weaving Factory. The workers of this factory, famous for weaving silk portraits and landscapes, presented Chairman Voroshilov with a portrait of himself, which they had rushed to weave in the past few days.

    苏联贵宾泛舟游西湖
    据新华社杭州25日电　伏罗希洛夫主席今天下午在西湖和欢乐的杭州市民交朋友。
    下午两点四十五分，伏罗希洛夫主席在西泠桥畔乘上游艇。周恩来总理、贺龙副总理、外交部副部长姬鹏飞和浙江省、杭州市的党政负责人和他一同泛舟游览。
    贵宾们在三潭印月、湖心亭等地上岸时，遇见了许多游客。一群浙江医学院的学生把一个大红信封给周总理，原来里面是一幅送给伏罗希洛夫主席的丝织的毛泽东主席像。伏罗希洛夫主席十分高兴地说：“这是我所得到的礼物中最好的礼物”。
    伏罗希洛夫主席乘坐的船只绕着苏堤缓缓地划过，近千个青年在堤上雀跃欢笑，一直跟着船的行进方向奔跑。伏罗希洛夫主席轻声地唱着歌，不时向堤上的人群招手。
    贵宾们在湖上泛舟以后，参观了都锦生丝织厂。这个以丝织人像、风景著名的工厂的工人，把在最近几天赶织起来的伏罗希洛夫主席的肖像送给了他本人。
