Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 8th: The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party issued a statement on April 7th, supporting President Sukarno in organizing a supra-parliamentary emergency cabinet.

    The statement said that the President's action would be welcomed by the people; it is politically appropriate and responsible, and legally sound, because Article 51 of the Indonesian Provisional Constitution does not prohibit the President from designating himself as the cabinet formateur. In addition, Sukarno has made it clear that he does not intend to dissolve Parliament.

    The statement said that at present, it is impossible to form a coalition cabinet centered on certain political parties, or to form a cooperation cabinet. Only the President's organization of a supra-parliamentary emergency cabinet is a viable path.

    The statement said that, based on the above views, the Indonesian Communist Party supports the organization of a supra-parliamentary emergency cabinet to end the current war and state of martial law and eliminate factors hindering Indonesia's democratic development.

    The statement said that the Indonesian Communist Party and the Indonesian people hope that the new cabinet and the National Council can be composed of truly trustworthy, patriotic, incorruptible, and capable people. The Indonesian Communist Party also calls on the people to help the President overcome the current difficulties.

Xinhua News Agency, April 8th: According to TASS, Delhi, April 8th: According to the "Delhi Times" correspondent in New York, sources close to the U.S. delegation to the United Nations report that the United States and the Netherlands recently held secret talks in New York. The content of the talks concerned how the United States and the Netherlands would coordinate their actions in supporting Indonesian separatists who oppose the central government.

    The two sides decided during the talks that the Netherlands would provide military assistance to the South Moluccan gangs, and the United States and the Netherlands would jointly support the "Wild Bull Division Council" and other separatist organizations in Sumatra. The Dutch representative agreed to allow the United States to use the Koba and Sorong military bases currently under construction in West Irian along with the Netherlands. Therefore, the United States and the Netherlands will establish a special committee headquartered in The Hague.

    印度尼西亚共产党声明
    赞成苏加诺组织超国会内阁
    美国和荷兰密谋支持印度尼西亚分裂分子
    新华社雅加达8日电　印度尼西亚共产党中央政治局4月7日发表声明，赞成苏加诺总统组织超国会的非常事务内阁。
    声明说，总统这个行动是会受到人民的欢迎的；它在政治上是适当的和负责的，在法律上是没有错误的，因为印度尼西亚临时宪法第五十一条并不禁止总统指定本人为组阁人。此外，苏加诺已经明确地说，他不打算解散国会。
    声明说，目前要组织以某些政党为中心的联合内阁，或者是组织合作内阁都已经不可能。只有总统组织超国会的非常事务内阁才是走得通的道路。
    声明说，根据上述看法，印度尼西亚共产党赞成组织超国会的非常事务内阁来结束目前的战争和戒严状态并且消除阻碍印度尼西亚民主发展的因素。
    声明说，印度尼西亚共产党和印度尼西亚人民希望新阁和民族委员会能够由真正获得人民信任的、爱国的、廉洁的和有能力的人组成。印度尼西亚共产党还号召人民帮助总统克服当前的困难。
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社德里8日讯：据“德里时报”驻纽约记者报道，根据接近美国驻联合国代表团的人士的消息，美国和荷兰两国不久以前在纽约举行了秘密会谈。会谈的内容是关于美荷两国在支持印度尼西亚的反对中央政府的分裂分子方面如何配合行动的问题。
    双方在会谈中决定：荷兰将对南摩鹿加群岛的匪帮提供军事援助，美荷两国将对“雄牛师委员会”和苏门答腊的其他从事分裂活动的组织给予共同支持。荷兰代表同意让美国同荷兰一起使用目前正在西伊里安建筑的科巴和梭弄军事基地。因此美荷两国将成立一个特别委员会，这个委员会的总部将设在海牙。
