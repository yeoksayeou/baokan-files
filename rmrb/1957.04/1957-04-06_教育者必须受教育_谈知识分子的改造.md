    Educators Must Be Educated
    —On the Remolding of Intellectuals—
    Marx said in his “Theses on Feuerbach,” “The circumstances are changed precisely by men and that the educator himself needs educating.” We are undertaking a great socialist construction. In this great cause, intellectuals will increasingly play an important role. In order to enable intellectuals to better serve socialism, it is necessary to strengthen ideological and political education for intellectuals. Marx’s words give us profound enlightenment.
    Our Party and the government have always attached importance to intellectuals. The Party and the government have implemented a policy of uniting, educating, and remolding intellectuals nationwide, paying full attention to using intellectuals to serve our country’s socialist construction. While uniting, educating, and remolding the old intellectuals, the Party has used great strength to cultivate a large number of new intellectuals, among whom a considerable number are intellectuals from the working class. At present, the face of China's intellectual circles has undergone fundamental changes.
    However, the ideological state of intellectuals is not entirely consistent with their changes in political and social status. Among the millions of intellectuals in our country, only a few are relatively familiar with Marxism-Leninism; most are willing to study Marxism-Leninism, but have learned very little. These people are patriots. There are also a few who are also patriotic and willing to accept the socialist system, but are unwilling to accept the Marxist-Leninist worldview. In addition to this, there are, of course, a very small number of people who are not very welcoming of socialism, and even maintain hostile emotions.
    The situation in which some intellectuals have not accepted or do not approve of Marxism-Leninism will exist for a long time. If we do not recognize this situation, we will make excessive and unreasonable demands, and will even reduce or cancel our tasks. If everyone were a Marxist, what task would there be to promote Marxism?
    Marxist-Leninists have the task of propagating Marxism-Leninism and believe that intellectuals should study Marxism-Leninism. However, the learning of intellectuals can only be voluntary. On the issues within the people, on the issues of an ideological nature, we cannot adopt crude methods.
    Intellectuals are the teachers of the people. However, those who educate the people must first be educated themselves; without education, they cannot educate the masses. Times have changed and are advancing rapidly. If intellectuals do not discard outdated things, do not study new problems, and do not accept new things, they will become detached from the masses of the people, unable to find a common language with the people, and they will accomplish nothing, let alone be the teachers of the people. In fact, intellectuals themselves, for the most part, are now deeply aware of this. Those who believe that intellectuals do not need education and do not need remolding are not only a very small minority, but also difficult to resonate with the majority.
    What should intellectuals learn? There are naturally many things to learn; but we believe that the study of Marxism-Leninism is indispensable. Because Marxism-Leninism is the correct worldview and methodology. Only by observing things and handling problems by using the Marxist-Leninist standpoint, viewpoints, and methods can we avoid making mistakes, and can we eliminate the influence of capitalism, individualism, and idealism in our thinking. Those who study Marxism-Leninism should include both Party members and non-Party intellectuals. We know that among Communist Party members, there are still very few who truly understand and use Marxism-Leninism, and there are even those who are non-Marxist-Leninist, such as those who commit dogmatic errors. Moreover, Marxism-Leninism is constantly developing. We need to learn, learn, and learn again. On the other hand, non-Party intellectuals can also become true Marxists. As everyone knows, Lu Xun, the standard-bearer of the Chinese New Culture Movement, was a non-Party Marxist. Therefore, intellectuals should not only study Marxism-Leninism, but also can learn it very well. Moreover, since Marxism-Leninism is the soul of our social life and the guiding ideology in our national life, intellectuals, as citizens of the country, are influenced by Marxism-Leninism every day, whether consciously or unconsciously, whether they want to or not. The correctness of Marxism-Leninism is confirmed in our lives every day. Therefore, even if some intellectuals do not approve of Marxism-Leninism now, we believe that as long as they are willing to be loyal to objective truth, they will gradually approach and accept Marxism-Leninism.
    Naturally, the study of Marxism-Leninism can only be the self-education of intellectuals on a voluntary basis. The so-called remolding of intellectuals is the self-remolding of intellectuals. Our Party’s responsibility is to provide well-intentioned and effective assistance under the conditions that people are willing, to help them study Marxism-Leninism, to carry out self-education and self-remolding, and not to impose Marxism-Leninism on others.
    Marxism-Leninism is constantly developing, so learning should be combined with practice, opposing dogmatic learning methods. Learning, practice; re-practice, re-learning; being a student while being a teacher; gradually learning to master Marxism-Leninism, and comprehensively analyzing problems. In the learning process, we must advocate the meeting of minds, and carry out criticism and self-criticism, so as to eliminate old ideas and establish new ideas.
    Observation of social life is also one of the important methods to establish a Marxist-Leninist worldview. Moreover, generally speaking, the educational role of social life is the most direct and extensive. For intellectuals who are not from laboring people, the establishment of a Marxist-Leninist worldview is often not easy. Intellectuals must walk down from the throne of the "petty-bourgeois kingdom" in the depths of their hearts and go to factories and rural areas to feel the breath of the working people and observe the pulse of social life. In this way, it is possible to transform from a Marxist-Leninist in books to a true Marxist-Leninist. If everyone learns Marxism-Leninism, then we will have a common language, which will play a huge role in educating the people and smoothly promoting the cause of socialist construction. We have seen that after many senior intellectuals went to factories and rural areas, they changed their original one-sided views and corrected their ideological understanding. One intellectual said it well, "Make all the good friends in the world, and read all the wonderful books in the world. Today's wonderful book is Marxism-Leninism, dialectics. Today's good friends are the workers, peasants and laboring intellectuals."
    In order to facilitate intellectuals in studying Marxism-Leninism, Party organizations in various places should actively prepare conditions. At present, local Party committees, in accordance with the principles of voluntariness and connection with professional work, have stipulated some compulsory basic courses of Marxism-Leninism, adopting methods such as self-study, attending night universities, correspondence schools, political schools, scientific seminars, report meetings, and study groups to help intellectuals study theory. Democratic parties have also paid attention to using various methods to help everyone carry out self-education and self-remolding, and to help everyone better study Marxism-Leninism. The National Committee of the CPPCC has already established the Socialist Academy, and all people's organizations and local committees of the CPPCC, which are responsible for educating, remolding, and uniting intellectuals, must take organizing intellectuals to study Marxism-Leninism and participate in social life practice as their regular work. Various places should continue to organize these studies. The instructors of the study should have a certain level of expertise, and the study plans and methods should be suitable for the needs of various types of intellectuals. As long as we adopt a positive, enthusiastic and prudent attitude, we will certainly be able to help millions of intellectuals across the country realize the glorious mission of self-education and self-remolding in the current great historical transformation period.

### 教育者必须受教育—谈知识分子的改造—

    教育者必须受教育
    —谈知识分子的改造—
    马克思在“费尔巴哈论纲”中说，“环境正是由人来改变的，而教育者必须受教育。”我们正在进行伟大的社会主义建设。在这伟大的事业中，知识分子将日益发挥重要的作用。为了使知识分子能够更好地为社会主义服务，必须加强对知识分子的思想政治教育工作。马克思的话给了我们以深刻的启示。
    我们的党和政府向来是重视知识分子的。党和政府在全国范围内对于知识分子实行了团结、教育、改造的政策，充分注意使用知识分子，为我国的社会主义建设服务。在团结、教育、改造旧的知识分子的同时，党用了很大力量培养大量的新的知识分子，其中已有相当数量从劳动阶级出身的知识分子。目前，我国知识界的面貌已经发生了根本的变化。
    但是，知识分子的思想状况，同他们在政治和社会地位上的变化并不是完全相适应的。在我国几百万知识分子中，还只有少数人对马克思列宁主义比较熟悉；多数人愿意学习马克思列宁主义，但是学得还很少。这些人都是爱国主义者。还有少数人也爱国，也愿意接受社会主义制度，但是不愿意接受马克思列宁主义的世界观。除此以外，当然也还有极少数人对社会主义不很欢迎，甚至保持敌对的情绪。
    一部分知识分子还没有接受或者还不赞成马克思列宁主义，这种状况在很长的时间内都会存在。如果不承认这种状况，我们就会要求过高，要求得不合理，而且就会把自己的任务降低甚至取消。如果所有的人都是马克思主义者了，还有什么宣传马克思主义的任务呢？
    马克思列宁主义者是有宣传马克思列宁主义的任务的，是认为知识分子应当学习马克思列宁主义的。但是知识分子的学习只能通过自愿。在人民内部的问题上，在思想性质的问题上，不能采取粗暴的方法。
    知识分子是人民的先生。但是，教育人民的人先要受教育，不受教育就无法去教育广大群众。时代变了，并且在迅速地前进着。知识分子如果不丢掉过时的旧东西，不研究新问题，不接受新事物，他就会脱离人民群众，同人民群众找不到共同语言，他就会一事无成，根本谈不到去作人民的什么先生。事实上，知识分子本身，就大多数来说，现在对于这一点也已经有深切的感受了。认为知识分子不需要受教育、不需要改造的人，不但是极少数，而且也难于得到多数人的共鸣。
    知识分子要学些什么呢？要学的东西自然很多；但是我们认为，马克思列宁主义的学习是不可缺少的。因为马克思列宁主义是正确的世界观和方法论。只有运用马克思列宁主义的立场、观点和方法观察事物，处理问题，才能不犯错误，才能扫除思想上资本主义、个人主义和唯心主义的影响。学习马克思列宁主义的人，应当包括党内和党外的知识分子。我们知道，共产党员中能够真正懂得并且运用马克思列宁主义的人，也还很少，甚至还有非马克思列宁主义的，比如犯教条主义毛病的人就是。而且，马克思列宁主义是不断发展的。我们需要学习，学习，再学习。另一方面，非党的知识分子，也完全可能成为真正的马克思主义者。如大家所知道的，中国新文化运动的旗手鲁迅，就是一个非党的马克思主义者。因此，知识分子不但应当学习马克思列宁主义，而且可以学得很好。而且，由于马克思列宁主义是我们的社会生活中的灵魂，是我们国家生活中的指导思想，知识分子作为国家公民来说，无论自觉不自觉，无论愿意不愿意，每天都在受到马克思列宁主义的影响。马克思列宁主义的正确性，每天在我们的生活中都在得到证实。因此，即使有的知识分子现在还不赞成马克思列宁主义，但是只要他愿意忠于客观真理，我们相信，他也一定会逐步接近和接受马克思列宁主义。
    自然，学习马克思列宁主义，只能是知识分子在自愿基础上的自我教育。所谓知识分子的改造，乃是知识分子的自我改造。我们党的责任，是要在人们愿意的条件下，进行好心的和切实有效的帮助，帮助他们学习马克思列宁主义，进行自我教育和自我改造，而不是用马克思列宁主义强加于人。
    马克思列宁主义是不断发展的，因此学习应当结合实际，反对教条主义的学习方法。学习，实践；再实践，再学习；边做学生，边做先生；逐步学会掌握马克思列宁主义，全面地分析问题。在学习过程中，要提倡思想见面，展开批评和自我批评，这样才能清除旧思想，树立新思想。
    通过社会生活的观察，也是树立马克思列宁主义世界观的重要方法之一。而且，一般地说来，社会生活的教育作用最为直接和广泛。对于非劳动人民出身的知识分子来说，马克思列宁主义世界观的树立往往是不容易的。知识分子要走下心灵深处的“小资产阶级王国”的宝座，到工厂、农村中去，去感受劳动人民的呼吸，观察社会生活的脉搏的跳动。这样，就有可能从书本上的马克思列宁主义者，变成真正的马克思列宁主义者。如果大家都学到了马克思列宁主义，那么便有了共同的语言，对于教育人民，顺利推进社会主义建设事业将会起极大的作用。我们已经看到，许多高级知识分子走到工厂和农村去了以后，改变了他们原来片面的看问题的观点，端正了思想认识。有一位知识分子说得好，“交尽天下良友，读尽人间奇书。今天的奇书，就是马克思列宁主义、辩证法。今天的良友，就是工农群众和劳动的知识分子。”
    为了便利知识分子学习马克思列宁主义，各地党的组织应当积极准备条件。目前，各地中共党委按照自愿和联系业务的原则，规定一些必修的马克思列宁主义的基本课程，采取自学、上夜大学、函授学校、政治学校、科学讨论会、报告会、学习组等方法，来帮助知识分子学习理论。民主党派对于所联系的群众——知识分子，也已经注意运用各种方法，帮助大家进行自我教育和自我改造，帮助大家更好地学习马克思列宁主义。政协全国委员会已经创办了社会主义学院，负有教育、改造、团结知识分子任务的各人民团体和政协地方委员会，都要把组织知识分子学习马克思列宁主义，参加社会生活实践作为自己经常的工作。各地应当继续组织这些学习。学习的指导人应当具有一定的水平，学习的计划和方法要适合各类知识分子的需要。只要我们采取积极的、热诚的和谨慎的态度，我们就一定可以帮助全国几百万知识分子在当前的伟大的历史变革时期实现自我教育、自我改造的光荣使命。
