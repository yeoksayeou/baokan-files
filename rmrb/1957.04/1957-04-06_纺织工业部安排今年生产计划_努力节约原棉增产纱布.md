The Ministry of Textile Industry Arranges This Year's Production Plan
    Striving to Save Raw Cotton and Increase Yarn and Cloth Production
    (Our report) The Ministry of Textile Industry recently held a meeting to arrange the 1957 production plan. In light of the current shortage of raw material supply, the meeting discussed and arranged this year's production tasks.
    The meeting believes that: Due to natural disasters that affected agricultural production last year, resulting in a poor cotton harvest, there will be a shortage of raw cotton this year, and textile industrial production will face certain difficulties. The total output of cotton yarn this year is expected to decrease by more than 400,000 bales compared to last year. Because production tasks cannot meet equipment needs, it is necessary to reduce production to overcome the difficulties. To prevent losses and confusion that may arise during the period of reduced production, the meeting believes that textile industrial production tasks should be arranged comprehensively for various economic types of textile industries in the spirit of overall consideration and coordination. To meet the needs of the people and the special difficulties of individual industries, knitted goods and related textile handicrafts cooperatives will be given consideration. Cotton textile factories can adopt measures such as reducing shifts, lowering machine speeds, suspending machine operation, and postponing the commissioning of new factories. The specific arrangements for production cuts and shutdowns can be flexibly managed and properly arranged according to local conditions. During the shutdown period, workers' wages will be paid in accordance with the State Council's regulations. The wages of enterprises accepting processing orders during the shutdown period can be borne by the commercial departments. The wages of handicrafts cooperatives during the shutdown period can be paid from the public welfare fund. During the shutdown period, textile industries should make full use of this time to repair machines, organize employee learning, and reorganize teams to welcome new developments in production.
    In order to fully and rationally utilize raw cotton, deeply develop the campaign to increase production and practice economy, and increase the production of a certain amount of cotton yarn and cotton cloth to appropriately meet the needs of the people, the meeting requires all factories to save raw cotton and utilize waste products and substitutes as much as possible. The meeting believes that improving product design specifications, such as spinning high-count yarn and increasing the count of yarn used for cloth, is a direction for increasing yarn and cloth production in the future. However, changes in yarn and cloth specifications should be preceded by a trial phase, and should never be done hastily, which would affect quality.
    The meeting believes that in the campaign to increase production and practice economy, product quality must be emphasized, as poor quality is the greatest waste.
    Due to the reduction in capital construction, the meeting decided to concentrate funds to ensure the progress of key construction projects, and the expansion projects of old factories will be temporarily suspended.
    The meeting conducted research on issues such as quality standards, democratic management, and political and ideological education, and also summarized the work of the past year.

    纺织工业部安排今年生产计划
    努力节约原棉增产纱布
    本报讯　纺织工业部最近举行了1957年生产计划安排会议。会议针对当前原料供应不足的情况，讨论和安排了今年的生产任务。
    会议认为：由于去年农业生产受到自然灾害，棉花歉收，今年原棉不足，纺织工业的生产有一定的困难。今年棉纱总产量预计将比去年减少四十万件以上。由于生产任务不能满足设备需要，必须减产度过困难。为了防止发生减产期间可能引起的损失和混乱现象，会议认为：纺织工业的生产任务应根据统筹兼顾的精神，全面安排各种经济类型纺织工业的生产。为适应人民需要和个别行业的特殊困难，将给予针织和有关纺织的手工业社以照顾。各棉纺织厂可以采用减少班次、降低车速、停开机台和推迟新厂开工日期等办法。至于减产停工的具体布置，可按各地情况灵活掌握，妥善安排。在停工期间，工人的工资照国务院的规定发给。接受加工的企业停工期间的工资可由商业部门负担。手工业合作社停工期间的工资可用公积金支付。在停工期间，各纺织工业应充分利用这段时期，检修机台，组织职工学习，整编队伍，迎接生产的新发展。
    为了充分和合理地发挥原棉的作用，深入开展增产节约运动，增产一定数量的棉纱和棉布，适当满足人民需要，会议要求各厂节约原棉，尽可能利用废品和代用品。会议认为，改进产品设计规格，如改纺高支纱和提高布用纱的支数，是今后增产纱布的一个方向。但是，在改变纱、布的规格以前，应该经过试验阶段，决不能草率从事，影响质量。
    会议认为在增产节约运动中，一定要重视产品质量，质量不好，就是最大的浪费。
    由于基本建设的削减，会议决定集中资金，保证重点建设的进行，老厂的扩建工程暂时全部停止。
    会议对质量标准、民主管理、政治思想教育等问题进行了研究，还总结了去年的工作。
