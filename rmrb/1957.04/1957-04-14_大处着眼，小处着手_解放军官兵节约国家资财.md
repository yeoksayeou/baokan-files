Xinhua News Agency, April 13th: The broad masses of officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are meticulously calculating and saving national resources everywhere.

    The slogan "Think Big, Start Small" has taken root in the hearts of the people in all military units. Medical staff in a certain military hospital in Chengdu are now washing and disinfecting large quantities of cotton balls and gauze that used to be discarded after each use, and then reusing them. A certain artillery company of the Nanjing garrison uses alkali water to boil dirty cloths used for wiping cannons, and then rinses them with clean water for reuse.

    Many troops pay close attention to collecting and utilizing waste materials. A certain warehouse of the Wuhan garrison used discarded bicycle parts to assemble 530 bicycles for use by the troops.

    “大处着眼，小处着手”
    解放军官兵节约国家资财
    据新华社13日讯　中国人民解放军广大官兵处处精打细算，节约国家资财。
    在各部队里，“大处着眼，小处着手”的口号已经深入人心。成都某军医院里的医护人员，把过去每用一次就扔掉的大批棉球、棉纱，漂洗消毒后继续使用。南京驻军某炮兵连，把擦过炮的脏布用碱水煮后，再用清水漂洗干净重新使用。
    许多部队十分注意收集和利用废旧物资。武汉驻军某仓库利用报废的破烂自行车零件，拼凑装配了五百三十辆自行车发给部队使用。
