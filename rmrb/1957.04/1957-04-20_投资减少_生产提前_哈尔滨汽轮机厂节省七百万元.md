Less Spending, More Accomplishment

	Reduced Investment, Earlier Production
	Harbin Turbine Factory Saves Seven Million Yuan
	(Our Newspaper) This newspaper reports that the Harbin Turbine Factory is one of the nation's key projects. This year has the largest workload of the year with planned investments doubling compared to last year. However, this factory collaborated with the Boiler Factory, the Electric Motor Factory, and other brother factories in building the plant, reducing the need to build many auxiliary workshops such as cast iron, drop hammer, forging, welding rod, and gas stations, which saved 4,210,000 yuan. The three factories jointly built a dedicated railway station, and by jointly using one locomotive, the three factories can use two fewer locomotives and two fewer sets of management personnel for two railway stations. Based on this, the factory headquarters re-arranged this year's construction plan, eventually determining to cut investments by 7,005,000 yuan and advance the production of steam turbine generators by one year ahead of schedule, namely by the end of next year.
	From what aspects was the reduction of 7,005,000 yuan achieved? In terms of civil engineering construction projects, the original plan was to renovate the seven old warehouses received from neighboring factories. Now, the five warehouses that can be used without renovation will not be renovated, reducing expenses by 735,000 yuan. Due to material shortages this year, the construction of civil defense command posts, fire truck garages, and spray cooling room projects, which could be postponed, were also cut, reducing expenses by 417,100 yuan. Cutting just the civil defense command post project freed up more than 60 tons of steel, which can be used for more urgently needed projects this year. Based on the principle of appropriately considering or gradually building living and welfare projects as production develops, dormitories and welfare projects with an area of 15,000 square meters and an investment of 1,080,000 yuan were reduced. In terms of equipment procurement and installation, in addition to listing the equipment and tools urgently needed to ensure the production of steam turbine generators by the end of next year in this year's plan, equipment that could not be fully utilized during the initial stages of production and was not urgently needed was also cut from this year's plan, reducing expenses by a total of 4,390,000 yuan. This factory also determined the time and number of personnel entering the factory in batches based on actual work needs. Except for special types of work and senior technical types of work that could not be resolved locally and were transferred from other places, general types of work were resolved and trained locally as much as possible. This can save a lot of travel expenses, moving expenses, and settling-in expenses for personnel transferred from other places. Personnel entering the factory later reduces the need for housing this year. Three departments were also reduced.

### 投资减少　生产提前  哈尔滨汽轮机厂节省七百万元

    投资减少　生产提前
    哈尔滨汽轮机厂节省七百万元
    本报讯　哈尔滨汽轮机厂是国家重点工程之一，今年是工作量最多的一年，原计划投资比去年增加二倍。但是，这个厂和锅炉厂、电机厂等兄弟工厂协作建厂，少建了铸铁、落锤、锻工、电焊条、煤气站等许多辅助车间，少花了四百二十一万元。三个厂联合建设一个专用线火车站，联合用一个机台，三个厂就可以少用两台机车和两个火车站的两套管理人员。在这个基础上，厂部重新安排了今年的建设计划，最后确定削减投资七百万零五千元，并且可以比预定计划提前一年，即明年年底生产汽轮发电机。
    削减七百万零五千元的投资从哪些方面入手呢？在土木建筑的工程项目上，原来计划把从邻厂接收过来的七个旧仓库重新改建；现在把不改建也可以装东西的五个仓库都不改建了，削减了七十三万五千元。由于今年材料缺乏，把可以推迟缓建的人防指挥所、消防车库和喷水冷却室工程也都削掉了，减少了四十一万七千一百元。仅削减人防指挥所一项工程就腾出六十多吨钢材，可以用到今年更急需的工程上去。根据适当照顾或随着生产发展逐步建设生活福利工程的原则，削减了一万五千平方公尺、投资一百零八万元的宿舍和福利工程。在设备购置和安装方面，除了把能保证明年年底生产汽轮发电机所急需的设备和工器具列入了今年计划之外，把那些在初投入生产时不能全部发挥作用和需要不急的设备，也都从今年计划中削掉了，共减少了四百三十九万元。这个厂还根据实际工作需要，确定了人员陆续进厂的时间、人数；除了那些当地不能解决的特殊工种和高级技术工种从外地调入外，一般工种尽量就地解决就地培养。这样可以节省大量从外地调入人员的车费、搬家费和安家费。人员晚进厂，就减少了今年住宅的需要。科室也减少了三个。　　（寒　青）
