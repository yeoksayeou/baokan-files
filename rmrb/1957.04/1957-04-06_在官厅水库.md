    At the Guanting Reservoir
    (Reported by this newspaper) The greening work in the Nanzhai, Reservoir Management Office, and Power Station districts around the Guanting Reservoir is progressing actively. In addition to planting 7,596 mu of forest last autumn, this year it is planned to plant 5,000 mu of forest with species such as oriental arborvitae and black locust. By the spring of 1959, the more than 2,000 hectares of barren mountains and wasteland in these three districts will have a brand-new look.
    In order to solve the problem of saplings for greening the reservoir, in addition to dispatching personnel to the Huangcun, Xiling, and Zhangjiakou forest farms and nurseries to transfer saplings in early March, the forestry work station also newly opened a 120-hectare nursery in the Honggou loam near the reservoir. At present, 80 hectares of nursery land have been prepared, and 45 hectares have been planted with seedlings. (Li Hongwen)

    在官厅水库
    本报讯　官厅水库外围的南寨、水库管理处、发电站三个分区的绿化工作，正在积极进行。除去年秋季造林七千五百九十六亩外，今年计划用侧柏、洋槐等树种造林五千亩。到1959年的春天，这三个分区的两千多公顷的荒山、荒地上，将要出现崭新的面貌。
    为了解决绿化水库的苗木，林业工作站除在3月上旬就派人到黄村、西陵、张家口等地林场苗圃调运苗木外，还在水库附近的洪沟壤新开了一所一百二十公顷大的苗圃。现在，已整好育苗地八十公顷，并育苗四十五公顷。（李鸿文）
