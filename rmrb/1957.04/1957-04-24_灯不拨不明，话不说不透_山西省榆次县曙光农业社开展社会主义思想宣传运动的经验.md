“A lamp will not shine if not adjusted, words will not be understood if not spoken clearly”
The experience of the Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative in Yucheng County, Shanxi Province, in carrying out the socialist ideological propaganda movement
Wang Chengwang, Secretary of the Yucheng Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

Not long ago, I led a work team to the Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative in Zhangqing Township, Yucheng County, to conduct a pilot project for the socialist ideological propaganda movement.

The Shuguang Cooperative is considered a relatively well-managed cooperative in the Yucheng area. Although it suffered a production reduction due to disaster last year, each work day still earned 1.2 yuan, and each person received an average of 447 jin of grain. The five-guarantee households who received the least grain still received 380 jin. The work of rectifying the Party and the cooperative last winter was done well. The cooperative cadres were capable and generally had a good work style, which the members approved of. When we arrived, the peasants' enthusiasm for production seemed high. Plans had been made, and contracts for work and output had been assigned to teams. The masses were very satisfied with this. At first glance, it seemed that there were no problems. Therefore, we once thought that this place might not be an ideal target for our pilot project.

	I. Understand the Underlying Ideology Thoroughly

Later, we thought that since we were here, it would be good to understand the ideological situation of the masses, and we might be able to discover some problems from the investigation and research. So, we convened a series of discussion meetings, including discussion meetings with well-off middle peasant households, discussion meetings with households with large populations, small labor forces, and difficult lives, youth discussion meetings, and finally a plenary discussion meeting of Party and League members. At these discussion meetings, especially at the Party and League members' discussion meeting, we found that there were still some major ideological problems among the peasants: a portion of people's enthusiasm for labor was not high; many young men and women were not content to produce in the countryside. What was the specific situation?

		Which people are not enthusiastic about labor?

I. Households with large populations, small labor forces, and difficult lives. In this cooperative, those with one laborer supporting five people accounted for 23.8% of the total number of households and 36.4% of the total population; those with six or more people accounted for 13.6% of the total number of households and 13.3% of the total population. Among them, the households that originally belonged to poor and lower-middle peasants were eager to work, but because they worked hard all year round, their lives were still not as good as others, so they were not happy in spirit. Their saying was: "Socialism is good, but those with large populations and small labor forces do not live well." As for the households of well-off middle peasants in this category, their morale was even worse because their income decreased after joining the cooperative.
II. Households with labor or more labor, small populations, small family burdens, high incomes, and good lives. Since the implementation of remuneration according to labor after joining the cooperative, their income has increased greatly compared to the past. In principle, they should be active in labor, and most of them are indeed like this, but there are also problems. Two types of people among them are not very active. One type feels that although they have a lot of money, they cannot easily buy the things they need. The other type is single men, whose marriage problems cannot be solved, and they feel that their personal life prospects are bleak, so their enthusiasm for labor is not high.
III. Well-off middle peasants whose income has not decreased are not as active as when they worked independently. They originally had very serious spontaneous ideas. They saved money and worked hard to manage their land, buy rubber-tired carts, and wanted to develop into rich peasants. At first, they did not join the three cooperatives (agriculture, supply and marketing, credit). Now, their saying is: "It's the same whether we are in the cooperative or not. Our income has not decreased. Even if we leave the cooperative, we can't buy livestock, purchase land, or hire long-term workers." The implication is that they are somewhat disappointed that they cannot develop capitalism. Both this type of household and the well-off middle peasant households whose income has decreased think that they are losing out by joining the cooperative. However, the former is expressed as less income than in the past; the latter is expressed as not being able to get rich. They all believe that this is because those who originally had no means of production, or few means of production, are now sharing their wealth based on labor. Their saying is: "Socialism is like this. Those who are smiling pull those who are crying, and those who are crying pull those who are smiling. It's not okay to have too good a life, and those who don't have a good life should be supplemented by everyone, so that everyone can live about the same."
IV. Women in Zhangqing used to not have the habit of working in the fields. Since liberation, this situation has changed, especially after the advanced stage of cooperation. In order to get more work days, the attendance rate has increased greatly compared to the past. However, their thinking lags behind their practice. They think that agricultural labor is too hard, and even make up ditties to describe it, saying: "If women improve by a foot, they will be tanned black; if they improve by a yard, they will not be able to get into bed."

		What people are not content to produce in the countryside?

The fact that young people are not content with agricultural production is a serious problem. They are oriented towards the city and try to find ways to flow into the city. The peasants believe that life in the city is "good and the labor is easy," so they always want to get their children into the city. There is a complete primary school and a "capped" middle school in Zhangqing Village. The proportion of girls exceeds that of boys. Some girls openly say: Attending middle school does not necessarily mean going to college. It is good if you can find a job after graduation, but if not, you also have the conditions to marry someone from the city. When someone proposes marriage, their attitude is: "If he is a worker, I am willing; if he is a cadre, it can be discussed; if he is a peasant, don't come, lest I get angry." We made a statistic: From 1955 to 1956, of the fifty-seven girls who got married, thirty-six married into the city, including twenty-three who married workers, nine who married cadres, and four who married teachers. Twenty-one married into the countryside, but only two married farmers, and nineteen married demobilized soldiers. Marrying demobilized soldiers is certainly a good thing, but some girls do this because they see that demobilized soldiers have money and have the right to participate in work with priority, and can find ways to flow into the city.

Young men are already not content with the countryside, and the marriage problem adds fuel to the fire, so they also try their best to flow into the city. One young man could not find a lover in the village for several years. He became a policeman in the city and found one within three months of returning to the village. The fact that young men and women have this atmosphere will certainly cause ideological problems for others. The cooperative cadres are very annoyed. This cooperative cultivated thirteen accountants and work recorders the year before last, all of whom were graduates of higher primary schools, and now only one is left. The elderly worry and say: "We have been carrying manure buckets all our lives, but there will always be a time when we can't move. If the country doesn't think of a way to restrain young people, who will engage in rural production in the future! When I think of this, I don't have the strength to move." That's what they say, but their youth still want to find a way to send to the city; opposes other people's girls not marrying his son, but his girl doesn't want to marry a farmer either.

These two situations are of course not conducive to carrying out socialist construction in the countryside. Therefore, we decided to carry out socialist ideological propaganda in this cooperative.

	II. Let the masses educate themselves

According to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, our pilot method is to carry out an ideological movement, and in the movement, let the masses educate themselves. We first made an enlightening report, the general idea was: Our task is to build our country into a socialist industrialized country, and the task of the countryside, in addition to supporting national construction, is mainly to build its own village into a new socialist countryside. We talked about the long-term benefits of socialism and analyzed the above-mentioned materials we collected, and explained and criticized these people.

		Put what was said in the sorghum field on the table

Then, we studied this report and combined it with reality for discussion. At first, we thought that exposing ideas could not be so smooth, but the fact was not like that. This report seems to have stirred up a hornet's nest. The ten production teams discussed in ten stalls. The consistent saying was: This time, we have to see them "really" and put what we said in the sorghum field in the past on the table! See who is right and who is wrong. The words in the stomach are all said. They started arguing for half an hour, then sat down and asked someone to take notes, saying one by one, and said for another half an hour, until there were no new problems.

The opinions of the teams are roughly the same, mainly saying: Don't just say that farmers want to flow to the city and are not content with production, because life in the city is too good and life in the countryside is too bad. Who doesn't want to go to a good place? So the reason why this situation is caused is because the Communist Party and the People's Government have raised the workers too high and lowered the peasants too low. After entering the city, they forgot about the peasants. The same people are treated differently. The family members are biased. Some people said: "Let us love the country, love the community, you don't love us, why should we love you!"

They put forward the problems, and then discussed the solutions. At first, when they were angry, their methods were very simple: lower workers' wages, lower the prices of industrial products, raise the prices of agricultural products, prohibit young people from entering the city, cancel many restrictions on farmers entering the city, and improve all aspects of work. They thought this was the solution. Some people said: When will a Blue Sky Lord come out and speak for the peasants! Some said: Whoever answers half of these questions is Bao Gong! At that time, the situation was: negative opinions prevailed, there was a lot of noise, and even some positive opinions could not be inserted.

In the movement, the shortcomings of our work were: we did not follow the order of "first inside the Party, then outside the Party, first cultivate backbones, and then expand." Therefore, we had to make up this lesson. So we looked for backbones and activists, and first discussed with them how to solve these problems, and educated them to master weapons. We introduced them to the bottom line. It is said that the national grain is about 600 jin per person on average; the production of cloth is not much, it is impossible for everyone to average four feet, and some farmers cannot afford to buy two feet; the high price of industrial products is one of the methods of increasing national income; marriage problems can only be free marriage; young people entering the city must be planned and organized, because people cannot be absorbed casually in the future. Regarding the method of the meeting, it is proposed to divide into groups, hold small seminars, seven or eight people in a group, each group has active people, general people, and people with serious ideological and emotional problems, so that it is easy to sit down and discuss problems.

We focused on discussing these issues: Are workers' wages high, should they be? Is there enough food to eat? What to do if there are few cloth tickets? Can the price of industrial products be reduced? Can the price of agricultural products be increased? Is the farmers' difficult life due to the burden and price issues? What are the ways to improve life?

    “灯不拨不明，话不说不透”
    山西省榆次县曙光农业社开展社会主义思想宣传运动的经验
    中共榆次地委书记　王成旺
    不久以前，我带一个工作组到榆次县张庆乡曙光农业社进行了社会主义思想宣传运动的试点工作。
    曙光社在榆次专区来说，是一个办得比较好的社。去年虽因遭灾减产，每个劳动日还分到一元二角钱，每口人实际平均分粮四百四十七斤，分粮最少的五保户也分到三百八十斤。去冬整党整社工作做的不错。社干能力不弱，作风一般也好，社员都还赞成。我们去的时候，看来农民生产情绪也是好的，计划订出来了，包工包产也到队了，群众对这很满意。乍看起来，好像没有什么问题。因此，我们曾经想过，这个地方也许不是我们进行试点工作的理想对象。
        一、把思想的底子摸透
    后来想，既然来了，了解一下群众的思想情况也是好的，从调查研究中也许能发现一些问题。于是，我们召集了一系列的座谈会，包括富裕中农户座谈会，人口多、劳动力少、生活困难的一些户的座谈会，青年座谈会，最后开了个全体党团员座谈会。在这些座谈会上，特别是在党团员座谈会上，我们发现了农民思想上还有一些重大问题：一部分人的劳动积极性不高；不少青年男女不安心在农村生产。具体情况怎样呢？
              哪些人劳动积极性不高
    一、人口多、劳动力少、生活有困难的户。这个社一个劳动力养活五口者占总户数的23.8％，占总人口36.4％，六口以上者，占总户数13.6％，占总人口13.3％。其中，原属贫农下中农的户，他们是积极的要劳动的，但是由于终年辛苦劳动，生活比别人还是不好，因而在精神上不够愉快。他们的说法是：“社会主义好是好，就是人口多，劳力少的人过不好”。至于这一类户中原属富裕中农的户，由于入社后，收入减少，情绪就更坏了。
    二、有劳力或劳力多、人口少、家庭累赘不大、收入多、生活好的户。由于入社后实行按劳取酬了，收入比过去大大增加，按说劳动是应该积极的，大部也确是这样，但也有问题。他们中有两种人不太积极，一种人感到钱虽多，但不能随意买到需要的东西。另一种是单身汉，他们的婚姻问题得不到解决，感到个人生活前途暗淡，所以劳动劲头不大。
    三、收入没减少的富裕中农，也没有单干时积极。他们原来自发思想很严重，省吃俭用积极劳动经营，置土地、拴胶轮大车，想发展成富农。他们起初是三社（农业、供销、信用）不入。现在的说法是：“我们在社不在社一样，收入没减少，出了社也不能买牲口，置土地，雇长工。”言外之意是对不能发展资本主义有些失望。这一种户和减少收入的富裕中农户都以为他们入社是吃亏的。不过，前一种表现是比过去收入少；后一种表现是能发大财不能发了。他们都认为所以如此，就是因为原来没有生产资料的，或者生产资料少的，现在凭劳力把他们的油水分走了。他们的说法是：“社会（主义）就是这样，笑的拉哭的，哭的拉笑的，生活太好了不行，生活不好的大家补一补，都活的差不多就行啦。”
    四、张庆妇女，过去是没有上地习惯的。解放以来，这种情况有改变，特别是高级合作化以后，为了多得劳动日，出勤率比过去大大提高了。但思想落后于实践，认为农业劳动太苦，甚至编些顺口溜形容说：“妇女提高一尺，晒的墨黑，提高一丈，就上不了炕”。
            什么人不安心在农村生产
    青年不安心农业生产是一个严重问题，他们面向城市，想办法往城里流。农民们认为城里“生活好，劳动轻”，因此，总想把他们的子女弄进城里。张庆本村有个完小，有个“戴帽”中学，女生的比例超过男生，有些女孩子公然表示：住中学不一定要升学，毕了业能找个工作固然好，不能的话，也有了嫁给城里人的条件了。有人说媒的话，她们的态度是：“是工人，愿意；是干部，可以商议；是农民，趁早不要来，免得我动了脾气。”我们做了个统计：1955年至1956年出嫁姑娘五十七个，有三十六个嫁到了城里，其中嫁给工人的二十三人，嫁给干部的九人，嫁给教职员的四人，嫁到农村的二十一人，但只有两个是嫁给农民的，十九个是嫁给复员军人的。嫁给复员军人当然是好事，但是有些姑娘这样做是看见复员军人有钱，复员军人有优先参加工作的权利，能想办法流进城里。
    男青年本来就不安心在农村，在婚姻问题上又来了个火上加油，因此他们也想尽办法往城里流。有一个青年在村里几年了找不下爱人，进城当了警察没三个月回村就找上了。青年男女有这个空气，当然也会引起其他人的思想问题，社干部是很恼火的。这个社前年培养了十三个会计、记工员，都是高小毕业生，现在只丢下一个了。老年人发愁说：“我们这一辈子是扛毛粪桶了，但我们总有个动弹不动的时候，国家不想个办法制住青年人，将来农村生产谁搞呀！想起这来，我们也动弹的没劲啦。”话是这么说，但他家的青年，还是想办法要往城里打发；反对人家的姑娘不和他儿子结婚，可是他的姑娘也不愿意嫁给农民。
    这两种情况，当然都是不利于在农村进行社会主义建设的。因此，我们决定还是要在这个社进行社会主义思想宣传。
          二、让群众自己教育自己
    根据省委的指示，我们这个试点的办法就是要搞思想运动，要在运动中让群众自己教育自己。我们首先做了个启发报告，大意是说：我们的任务是要把我们的国家建设成一个社会主义的工业化的国家，农村的任务，除了支援国家建设以外，主要是把自己的村庄建设成一个社会主义的新农村，讲了讲社会主义的远景好处，将我们搜集到的上述材料，进行了分析，对这些人进行了解释和批判。
          把高粱地里说的话摆在桌面上
    然后，就以学习这个报告，联系实际进行讨论。起初，以为暴露思想可不能那么顺利，但是事实不是那样。这个报告好像是挑了马蜂窝。十个生产队分十个摊子讨论，一致的说法是：这一次咱可得和他们见个“真”，把过去高粱地里说的话都摆到桌面上来吧！看看究竟是谁对谁不对。肚子里的话都说出来了。他们开始吵了半个多钟头，然后坐下来，让人做记录，一条一条地说，又说了一个多钟头，直到没有新的问题才罢。
    各队意见大体一样，主要是说：不能光说农民想往城市流，不安心生产，因为城市生活太好，农民生活太坏，谁不愿往好处走？所以造成这种情况，就是因为共产党和人民政府，把工人抬得太高，把农民压得太低，进了城市忘了农民，一样的人民两样看待，当家人有偏心。有些人说：“让我们爱国啦，爱社啦，你们不爱我们，我们爱你们干啥！”
    他们摆出了问题，就讨论办法。起初，在火头上，他们的办法很简单：降低工人工资，降低工业品价格，提高农产品价格，禁止青年人进城，取消对农民进城的许多限制，改进各方面的工作。他们认为这就是办法。有些人说：什么时候出上个青天大老爷，能替农民出这口气！有的说：这些问题，谁答复上一半也是包公！当时的情况是：反面意见占了上风，大吵大闹，即使有些正面意见也插不上口。
    在运动中，表现出我们工作上的缺点是：没有按“先党内，后党外，先培养骨干，然后展开”的次序办事。因之，我们不得不补这一课。于是我们就找骨干、找积极分子，和他们先商量这些问题该如何解决，教育他们，使他们掌握武器。我们向他们介绍了一下底子。说全国粮食每人平均约六百斤；布生产不多，不可能每人都均四丈，两丈有的农民也买不起；工业品价格贵，是增加国家收入的方法之一；婚姻问题，只能婚姻自主；青年人进城，要有计划有组织，因为以后不能随便吸收人。关于开会的方法，提议划分小组，开小型座谈会，七八人一组，每个组有积极的，有一般的，也有思想情绪问题严重的，这样便于坐下来讨论问题。
    集中讨论了这几个问题：工人工资高不高，该不该？粮食够吃不够吃？布票少怎么办？工业品价格能不能减？农产品价格能不能提？农民生活困难是不是因为负担和价格问题？改善生活的办法是什么？
                                              （未完）
