    Agricultural Production Issues in the Manas River Basin
    Zhou Lisan, researcher and deputy director of the Institute of Geography of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Deng Jingzhong, associate researcher, have made preliminary progress in their research on "Agricultural Production and Cotton Specialization in the Manas River Basin, Xinjiang." Recently, they completed their research paper on this topic.
    The Manas River Basin is a nationally renowned area for high-yield cotton production, supplying tens of millions of catties of cotton to the state annually. They conducted a survey and study in the basin in 1956, affirming the tremendous achievements made in cotton production in the region in recent years—not only correcting the conservative notion that cotton could not be grown in northern Xinjiang but also creating experience in large-scale high-yield production, setting a brilliant example for the whole country. However, due to the rapid expansion of cotton planting area, a series of issues worthy of attention by economic geographers have arisen in production.
    In their paper, they point out that the current problem is primarily a tight grain supply. Before 1954, the region had surplus grain to supply the needs of the people of Urumqi. After 1955, not only could it not be shipped out, but there was also a feeling of grain shortage. According to the plans of various state farms and the preliminary plan for the Manas River Basin, the development of cotton will be the focus, and the cotton planting area will be further expanded. However, with the development of the petroleum industry and other industries in northern Xinjiang, the demand for grain will inevitably increase. Because Xinjiang is located in a remote border area and has a vast territory, the transportation distance for grain from other places is very long, which will inevitably increase the transportation burden and cause losses to the national economy. There is also an imbalance in the labor force. Cotton is a crop that requires intensive cultivation, and the labor management quota is several times higher than that of grain crops. Especially during the cotton picking season, manpower is even more strained. Under the conditions of a small labor force in northern Xinjiang, cotton production should not be over-concentrated. They further analyzed the natural conditions of northern and southern Xinjiang and believe that southern Xinjiang is more suitable for cotton growth. Therefore, based on the prospects of industrial and mining development in the region, from the perspective of rational production allocation, agricultural production in the Manas River Basin should focus on grain, and cotton should be appropriately developed without causing a grain supply imbalance.
    They will continue to conduct economic and geographical surveys and research in the northern Xinjiang region this year.

    玛纳斯河流域的农业生产问题
    中国科学院地理研究所研究员兼副所长周立三和副研究员邓静中研究的“新疆玛纳斯河流域农业生产与棉花专业化问题”，已经有了初步结果，最近他们这项研究的论文也已经撰写完毕。
    玛纳斯河流域是全国著名的棉花高额丰产地，每年供应国家棉花达几千万斤。他们于1956年在该流域进行了调查研究，肯定了近年来该地区在棉花生产上的巨大成就——不仅纠正了北疆不能种植棉花的保守思想，而且创造了大面积丰产的经验，为全国树立了光辉的榜样。但由于植棉面积的迅速扩大，在生产中已经发生一系列值得经济地理学家们注意的问题。
    他们在论文中指出，目前存在的问题首先是粮食供应紧张。1954年以前该地区有余粮供应乌鲁木齐人民的需要，1955年以后，不但不能外运，而且感到粮食不足。根据各国营农场规划和玛纳斯河流域初步规划，都将以棉花的发展为重点，植棉面积更将扩大。但随着北疆石油工业和其他工业的发展，粮食需要量必将增加，而由于新疆地位边远，幅员辽阔，从别处调粮运程很远，势必加重运输负担并造成国民经济上的损失。还有劳动力也不平衡。棉花是精耕细作的作物，劳动管理定额比粮食作物要多几倍，特别是收花季节，人力更为紧张，在北疆劳动力不多的条件下，棉花生产也不宜过分集中。他们进一步分析了北疆、南疆的自然条件，认为南疆更适宜于棉花生长。因此，根据该地区工矿业发展的远景，从合理的生产配置的观点来看，玛纳斯河流域农业生产应以粮食为主，在不造成粮食供应失调的前提之下，适当发展棉花。
    他们今年仍将在北疆地区进行经济地理方面的调查研究工作。
