Xinhua News Agency, April 4th, New York: World-renowned film actor Charlie Chaplin has completed his first film shot in Europe: "A King in New York." Through the experiences and encounters of a deposed European king in the United States, the film sharply satirizes the various aspects of the "American way of life." All scenes in the film are filled with humor.

The "New York Post" published a column by Sidney Skolsky, introducing the plot of the film as follows:

Chaplin, dressed in high-end modern clothing, plays a deposed king of a European country who travels to the United States by plane. Just as he is about to enter the United States and give his fingerprints, he talks about how happy he is to be able to enter this land of free people.

Chaplin, who believes he has money, is greeted by his former ambassador to the United States. They stroll along Broadway. All the noises on the street roar in unison, resulting in a noisy symphony. The king can no longer bear it and thinks of resting in the quiet environment of a Broadway cinema.

The king and his ambassador encounter teenagers running and screaming in the aisles of the theater; a performer sings a Jitterbug tune on stage. He decides to return to the street, because the street is quieter in comparison.

Chaplin and his ambassador live in the most luxurious hotel on Park Street. A famous professional party giver throws a grand and chic party, and the king is naturally the most ideal celebrity at the party. The king realizes that he doesn't have much money, but he also realizes that if you act and behave like a rich person in life, others will treat you like a rich person.

This party is broadcast on television. The king achieves great success, and the next day someone wants him to perform his own commercial television program. He quickly becomes the most popular person in the country.

Just as the king is becoming extremely popular on television, he meets a boy who is reading Karl Marx's works. The king is surprised and asks the child if he is a communist. The child asks him if only communists can read Karl Marx's works. Thus, a friendship develops between the child and the king.

Some time later, the child is summoned by an investigation committee; everything about the child, including the names of his friends, is made public. The king's television contract is cancelled. Public opinion changes. The former hero becomes unemployed overnight. Then comes the last scene of the film: the king sits in an airplane flying over New York to what he considers his old home, Europe.

Skolsky said that whether the film can be shown in the United States is still a question.

    卓别麟的新影片
    “国王在纽约”拍完
    辛辣地讽刺了美国生活方式
    新华社4日讯　纽约消息：世界著名的电影演员查利·卓别麟已经拍完了他在欧洲拍摄的第一部影片：“国王在纽约”。影片通过一个欧洲国家被黜的国王在美国的见闻和遭遇，辛辣地讽刺了“美国生活方式”的形形色色。在这部影片中，所有的场面都充满了幽默。
    “纽约邮报”发表悉尼·斯科耳斯基的专栏文章，介绍这个影片的情节如下：
    卓别麟身穿高等的现代服装，扮演一个欧洲国家的被黜的国王，乘飞机赴美。正当他在进入美国国境之前按指印的当儿，他谈论着他能够进入这个自由人的国土是多么高兴。
    自认为有钱的卓别麟受到了他的前驻美大使的迎接。他们在百老汇游逛。大街上所有的闹声都嚣然齐鸣，结果成了一部喧闹的交响乐，国王再也受不了，就想到百老汇的电影院的安静环境里去休息一下。
    国王和他的大使在这里遇到一些十几岁的少年在影院场子里的过道间跑来跑去，尖声喊叫；一位表演者则在台上唱着阿飞舞的曲子。他决定回到大街上去，因为比较起来还是大街上来得清静一些。
    卓别麟和他的大使住在公园街上的最豪华的大饭店里。一个著名的职业性的开晚会的人开了一个盛大别致的晚会，而国王自然就是会上的最理想的名人了。国王明白了他没有什么钱，但是他也明白了如果你在生活上和举动上做得像个有钱的人物的话，别人就会把你当作一个有钱的人来看待。
    这个晚会被搬上了电视。国王获得了很大的成功，第二天就有人要他演出他自己的商业性电视节目。他很快就成了一个在全国最受欢迎的人。
    正当国王在电视上红极一时的时候，他遇见了一个正在看卡尔·马克思的著作的男孩，国王很诧异，问小孩是不是共产党。小孩问他是不是只有共产党才能看卡尔·马克思的作品。于是小孩和国王之间产生了友谊。
    过了些时候，小孩受到一个调查委员会的传讯；关于这个小孩的一切，包括他的朋友的姓名，都被公布出来了。国王的电视合同被取消了。舆论转变了。昔日的英雄在一夜之间变成了无业游民。随后就是影片的最后一个镜头：国王坐着一架飞机飞过纽约上空到他认为他的老家欧洲去。
    斯科耳斯基说，这部影片是否能在美国上映还成问题。
