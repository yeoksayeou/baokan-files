    We Must Concentrate on Opposing Doctrinairism
    He Lin
    The arrogance of dogmatists is too great, making people afraid to "unleash" and afraid to "contend." Even if dogmatism does not ruin scientific research, it will at least greatly hinder the construction of socialist culture.
    Chairman Mao once said: "With the arrival of the high tide of economic construction, a high tide of cultural construction will inevitably appear." Undoubtedly, the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" is a great policy that guides and promotes the development of socialist culture in our country to reach a high tide. Comrade Lu Dingyi, in his article "Commemorating the Fifteenth Anniversary of the Rectification Movement," called on everyone to "strive to master the laws of development of socialist construction in our country as quickly as possible." Obviously, the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" was proposed after mastering the laws of development of socialist culture in our country. This policy is another flexible application and creative development of Marxism-Leninism in China, and this policy is the only correct and great policy guiding the construction of socialist culture in China. The reason why this policy is a great and correct policy for socialist cultural construction, and its difference from cultural construction in feudal or capitalist societies, lies in the fact that it, on the one hand, advocates independent thinking and free debate, which is enough to highly stimulate the enthusiasm, potential, and creativity of intellectuals throughout the country, but does not fall into the liberalism of capitalism of self-flow and spontaneity; on the other hand, it takes the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and the leadership of the Party as a prerequisite, but it opposes using administrative orders to solve academic and ideological problems, which is completely different from the cultural policies of the reactionary ruling class of dismissing all schools of thought, fixing on one, and controlling thought. In other words, the cultural policies of the old society were either scattered and unregulated liberalism or authoritarianism that controlled thought, fixed on one, and suppressed speech. With great and wise leadership, and with a high degree of democracy and freedom, it can also be said that the principle of combining leadership with the masses is embodied in cultural construction, and this is precisely the mastery of the laws of socialist cultural construction. We support the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," and we are jubilant and encouraged by the upcoming high tide of socialist cultural construction and the prosperity and brilliance of socialist academic culture.
    However, it will not be smooth sailing to implement this policy, and there are still many people who are not familiar with or even do not understand the laws of development of socialist cultural construction. The main obstacle to implementing this policy is, of course, dogmatism. Chairman Mao clearly instructed at the Supreme State Council and the National Propaganda Work Conference to continue to boldly implement the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," and repeatedly stated that dogmatism must be opposed. I would like to make some specific analyses on opposing dogmatism alone.
    The arrogance of dogmatists is due to the fact that they claim to be orthodox Marxists, and they boast that their Party spirit is strong, their combativeness is strong, and their adherence to principles is strong. This illusion frightens many people, making them silent and afraid to "unleash" and afraid to "contend." However, in fact, Chairman Mao told us that dogmatism is not fragrant flower, not Marxism, but anti-Marxism. And as Comrade Lu Dingyi pointed out: "Dogmatists also call themselves 'dialectical materialists' in philosophy. They also verbally admit the materialist principle that 'matter is primary and consciousness is secondary,' and claim that their worldview is a dialectical worldview, but in reality, they proceed from the subjective and observe things and deal with problems from an isolated, static, and one-sided point of view. In practice, they have departed from dialectics and fallen into metaphysics, and as a result, they have departed from materialism and fallen into idealism."
    Since dogmatists are anti-Marxists who have fallen into metaphysics and idealism, they cannot be said to have a strong Party spirit, a strong combativeness, or a strong adherence to principles. These are noble qualities with profound Marxist cultivation, worthy of respect and learning. Dogmatists have a strong Party spirit on the surface, but in reality, they have a narrow attitude and a strong sectarian color. Dogmatists have the illusion of strong combativeness, which is due to their habit of using crude and simplistic methods to fight against ideas different from their own, and adopting a one-size-fits-all attitude towards ideological contradictions within the people, rather than proceeding from the desire for unity. The so-called strong adherence to principles is due to their adherence to dogmas and abstract formulas, regardless of time, place, and conditions, and applying them in a uniform manner. It also lies in the fact that they often accuse others of "errors in principle" in their articles and speeches, and use dogmas and rigid rules to restrict them.
    Just now I talked about the characteristics of dogmatists who insist on dogmas and apply ready-made formulas in a uniform manner, so does that mean that they faithfully rely on classic works, and every judgment must have a basis or source in classic works? That's not the case. For example, in the study of the history of philosophy, many people say that Socrates was sentenced to death for his reactionary activities against the people. This lacks both factual evidence and the basis of classic works. For example, in this discussion on the history of philosophy, many people seem to generally recognize the dogma that "the struggle between materialism and idealism is absolute" as a guiding principle, and violating this dogma is denounced as "departing from Marxism" and "blurring the boundaries between materialism and idealism." However, not only can this principle not be found in classic works, but even Stalin, who one-sidedly and absolutely emphasized the struggle of contradictions, did not say such a thing. Needless to say, some dogmatists interpret classic works literally, arbitrarily adding subjective interpretations and extensions, resulting in "a difference of a hair's breadth leads to a discrepancy of a thousand miles." Therefore, I can say that dogmatists are not people who are careful and strictly abide by the original text of classic works, but people who are accustomed to arbitrarily distorting classic works. This can also explain why dogmatism is a kind of subjectivism, and it can also explain why dogmatists are often opportunists. They are good at watching the market, starting from personal worship, to speculate on the intentions of leaders, arbitrarily interpret dogmas, and arbitrarily pick out words and phrases in classic works that suit their own opinions.
    The articles written by dogmatists are called "Party stereotype." In the past, the stereotype essays written in the feudal era were called "examination papers." In the past, scholars, graduates, and top scholars wrote many good stereotype essays or examination papers, but I would like to ask, what academic value does any examination paper have? Real great scholars like Dai Dongyuan would not write stereotype essays. Now Chairman Mao has instructed to boldly implement the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," which means that speeches, articles, and works that are not in line with the stereotype essay format also have the opportunity to be published. This further indicates that socialist cultural construction does not need new-style examination papers, but needs real independent thinking and scientific research. Comrade Lu Dingyi once lamented: "Dogmatism almost ruined our country's revolution during the democratic revolution." In terms of academic culture, even if dogmatism does not ruin scientific research, it will at least greatly hinder the construction of socialist culture.
    Of course, dogmatism should be opposed, and right-leaning opportunism should also be opposed. However, I believe that we should focus on opposing the former. There are several reasons for this: First, in the article "Rectifying the Party's Style of Work," Chairman Mao said: "Among these two kinds of subjectivism, now... dogmatism is still more dangerous." In my opinion, in the current academic circles in China, among the two deviations of "left" dogmatism and right-leaning opportunism, dogmatism is still more dangerous.
    Second, I do not recognize that dogmatism and right-leaning opportunism are fundamentally opposed, in fact, the two are intrinsically linked or unified, and can also be said to be two sides of the same coin. It is not only very possible, but also common for the same person to be dogmatic and "left-leaning" on this issue, and opportunistic and right-leaning on another issue. Dogmatists tie their thoughts to a single rope, and they inevitably oppose new things, and they can be very conservative and very right-leaning. Chairman Mao told us: "They (referring to new stereotype essays and new dogmas) are not lively and vigorous things, but rigid things; they are not things that are moving forward, but things that are moving backward; they are not revolutionary things, but things that are hindering the revolution." From this, it can be seen that, strictly speaking, although dogmatism seems to be very "left" on the surface, it can still be right-leaning. Therefore, I believe that opposing dogmatism can also reduce right-leaning opportunism.
    Third, putting dogmatism and right-leaning opportunism on an equal footing or opposing them as two different lines of opposition not only fails to distinguish between the primary and secondary and the priorities, but in fact will relax or even cover up the main obstacle to "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" - dogmatism. Because on the one hand, dogmatists can regroup and transport dogmas to attack what they consider to be right-leaning opportunism, and many old intellectuals who are being reformed have not yet learned Marxism-Leninism well, and have not completely abandoned the old baggage of bourgeois idealism, and they are afraid of making the mistake of right-leaning opportunism, so they dare not open their mouths or start writing. This increases the concerns of old intellectuals who are being reformed. I guess that there are many people who are afraid of being labeled as right-leaning opportunists, and not only dare not oppose dogmatism, but even dare not publish many of their own independent thinking research results. In fact, as far as I understand, according to the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," as long as old intellectuals are not counter-revolutionaries, even if there are very few people who truly oppose Marxism, oppose learning from workers, peasants, and soldiers, insist on idealism, or insist on religious beliefs, we do not seem to be in a hurry to say that they are right-leaning opportunists, we should kindly mobilize them to dispel their concerns, and persuade them to express and write their thoughts as much as possible, and then help them analyze and criticize them, in order to achieve the goal of unity and reform. Eliminating the underground and hidden idealism, so that it can see the sun and not act strangely in the dark, and at the same time helping and encouraging those old intellectuals who are being reformed who only have some seeds of materialism to break their concerns and speak freely, so that the truth of Marxism becomes clearer with debate, in order to enhance the prosperity of our country's academic literature and art - this should also be one of the goals to be achieved by proposing the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend."

    必须集中反对教条主义
    贺麟
    教条主义者气焰太盛，使人不敢“放”不敢“鸣”。教条主义即使不会断送科学研究，至少也会大大妨碍社会主义文化建设。
    毛主席早就说过：“随着经济建设的高潮的到来，不可避免地将要出现一个文化建设的高潮。”无疑地，“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针就是指导并推进我国社会主义的文化建设使其达到高潮的伟大方针。陆定一同志在“纪念整风运动十五周年”一文中，号召大家“争取越快越好地掌握我国社会主义建设的发展规律”。很明显，“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针就是掌握了我国社会主义文化建设的发展规律而提出来的。这个方针是马克思列宁主义又一次在中国的灵活运用和创造性的发展，这个方针就是指导中国社会主义文化建设唯一正确的伟大的方针。这个方针之所以是社会主义文化建设的伟大而正确的方针，其不同于封建主义社会或资本主义社会文化建设之处，在于它一方面提倡独立思考、自由争论，足以高度发挥全国知识分子的积极性、潜在力和创造性，但又不陷于资本主义社会自流、自发的自由主义，另一方面，它以马克思列宁主义的指导和党的领导为前提，但它反对用行政命令来解决学术思想问题，与反动统治阶级罢黜百家，定于一尊，统制思想的文化政策有天渊之别。换言之，旧社会的文化方针，不是散漫无归的自由主义，就是统制思想、定于一尊、拑制言论的专制主义。有伟大英明的领导，有高度的民主与自由，也可以说，领导与群众相结合的原理之体现在文化建设上面，这正是掌握了社会主义文化建设的规律。我们拥护“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针，我们为即将到来的社会主义文化建设高潮、为社会主义学术文化的繁荣灿烂而欢欣鼓舞。
    但是，要贯彻这个方针并不会是一帆风顺的，不熟悉、甚至不理解社会主义文化建设的发展规律的人还是很多的。对于贯彻这个方针的主要障碍当然是教条主义。毛主席在最高国务会议上和全国宣传工作会议上明确地指示要继续放手贯彻执行“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，并一再表示必须反对教条主义。我想单就反对教条主义作一些具体的分析。
    教条主义者气焰之盛由于他以正统的马克思主义者自命，他自诩他的党性强、斗争性强、原则性强。这种假象吓坏了许多人，使得他们噤若寒蝉，不敢“放”，不敢“鸣”。然而事实上，毛主席告诉我们，教条主义不是香花，不是马克思主义，而是反马克思主义的。又诚如陆定一同志所指出：“教条主义者，在哲学上也自称为‘辩证唯物主义者’。他们也在口头上承认‘物质是第一性的，意识是第二性的’这个唯物主义原理，并且自称自己的宇宙观是辩证法的宇宙观，但是实际上他们是从主观出发，用孤立的、静止的和片面的观点来观察事物和处理问题。他们在实际上是离开了辩证法而陷入形而上学，结果也就离开了唯物主义而陷入了唯心主义。”
    教条主义者既然是陷入了形而上学和唯心主义的反马克思主义者，当然就说不上党性强、斗争性强、原则性强了。这些乃是有深厚马克思主义修养、值得尊敬与学习的高贵品质。教条主义者表面上党性强，实际上乃是态度狭隘，宗派主义色彩浓厚。教条主义者有斗争性强的假象，乃由于他们惯于用粗暴简单化的办法向与自己不同的思想作斗争，对于人民内部的思想矛盾采取一棍子打死的态度，而不是从团结的愿望出发所致。所谓原则性强，也就是由于他们坚持教条和抽象的公式，不问时间、地点和条件，千篇一律地加以应用。还在于他们动辄指责别人文章和言论中的“原则性的错误”，而以教条和清规戒律相绳。
    刚才谈到教条主义者有了坚持教条，千篇一律地应用现成公式的特点，那么是不是他们忠诚地依靠经典著作，每一句断语都必定有经典著作的根据或出处呢？那又不然。例如，在哲学史研究中，很多人把苏格拉底说成是为了他敌视人民的反动活动而被判处死刑。这既缺乏事实的证据，也没有经典著作的根据。又如，这次关于哲学史的讨论，很多人似乎都公认“唯物主义与唯心主义的斗争是绝对的”这一教条作为指导原则，违反这个教条便被斥为“脱离马克思主义”，“模糊了唯物主义和唯心主义的界限”，然而，不唯在经典著作中找不出这一条原理，而且即使那片面地绝对化矛盾的斗争的斯大林也没有说过这样的话。不用说，更有些教条主义者，对于经典著作望文生义，任意加以主观的解释引伸，结果是“差之毫厘，谬以千里”。因此我可以说，教条主义者并不是小心翼翼，严格遵守经典著作的原文的人，而是习于对经典著作加以随意歪曲的人。这也可以说明，为什么教条主义乃是一种主观主义，并可以说明，教条主义者所以每每又是应时主义者。他善于看行情，从个人崇拜出发，去揣测领导意图，随意解释教条，并随意在经典著作中去挑选适合自己意见的词句。
    教条主义者写的文章就叫做“党八股”。过去封建时代所写的八股文便叫做“闱墨”。过去的举人、进士、状元，写了很多很好的八股文或闱墨，试问哪一篇闱墨有什么学术价值呢？像戴东原这一类真正的大学问家倒反而不会写八股文。现在毛主席指示要放手贯彻“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针，这表示与八股文格式不相合的言论、文章、著作也有发表的机会。这更表示社会主义的文化建设不需要新式的闱墨，而需要真正的独立思考和科学研究。陆定一同志曾感慨地说过：“教条主义在我国民主革命时期中几乎断送了我国的革命”。在学术文化方面，教条主义即使不会断送科学研究，至少也会大大妨碍社会主义的文化建设。
    当然教条主义应该反对，右倾机会主义，也同样应该反对。不过我认为应该以反对前者为主。这有几个原因：第一，在“整顿党的作风”一文中，毛主席说：“在这两种主观主义中，现在……还是教条主义更为危险。”在我看来，现在国内学术界在“左”的教条主义与右倾机会主义两个偏向中，仍然还是教条主义更为危险。
    第二，我不承认教条主义与右倾机会主义是根本对立的东西，事实上两者是有内在联系或统一性的，也可以说是一事的两面。同一个人在这个问题上表现为教条主义，为“左”倾，在另一个问题上表现为机会主义，为右倾，这不单是很可能，而且是常有的。教条主义者把思想缠在一根绳子上，他难免不反对新生事物，他可以是很保守、很右倾的。毛主席告诉过我们：“它们（指新八股、新教条）不是生动活泼的东西，而是死硬的东西了；不是前进的东西，而是后退的东西了；不是革命的东西，而是阻碍革命的东西了。”由此足见，严格讲来，教条主义虽然表面上似乎是很“左”的，仍然可以是右倾的。因此我认为在反对教条主义的同时即可以消减右倾机会主义的。
    第三，把教条主义与右倾机会主义平列起来或对立起来作为反对的两个不同路线，不惟没有分别开主从和轻重缓急，而且事实上会放松甚至掩护“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的主要障碍物——教条主义。因为一方面教条主义者可以重振旗鼓，搬运教条来向他所认为的右倾机会主义进攻，而许多正在改造中的旧知识分子，他们的马克思列宁主义还没有学好，资产阶级唯心主义的旧包袱还没有完全丢掉，他们唯恐犯右倾机会主义的错误，因而也不敢开口动笔了。这就增加了在改造中的旧知识分子的顾虑。我揣想有许多怕被戴上右倾机会主义的帽子的人，不惟不敢反教条主义，连许多自己独立思考研究的成果也不敢发表了。事实上，据我了解，按照“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针，旧知识分子中只要他不是反革命分子，即使有极其个别的真正反对马克思主义、反对向工农兵学习，坚持唯心主义，或坚持宗教信仰的人，我们似乎不必忙于说他是右倾机会主义，我们应善意地动员他解除他的顾虑，劝他把他的思想尽量说出来、写出来，然后帮助他分析批判，以达到团结改造的目的。消灭地下的暗藏的唯心主义，使它能见阳光，不要暗中作怪，同时也扶助并鼓励那只有一些子唯物主义萌芽的在改造中的旧知识分子使他们打破顾虑，畅所欲言，使得马克思主义的真理愈辩愈明，以增进我国学术文艺的繁荣，——这也应是提出“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针所要达到的目的之一吧。
