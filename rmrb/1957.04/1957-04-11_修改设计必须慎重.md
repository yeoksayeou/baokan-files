    Modifications to Designs Must Be Handled With Caution
    Lù Hào
    In order to conserve raw materials, many machinery and electrical manufacturing departments in Shenyang City, proceeding from their specific circumstances, have creatively improved product designs and processes. This has not only saved a lot of steel but has also improved the performance of some products, thereby raising the factories' technical levels. This is of great significance for accelerating our country's socialist industrialization. However, modifying designs and processes is an extremely complex and meticulous task, and the slightest carelessness can lead to extremely serious consequences. Currently, the machinery and electrical industries are extensively engaged in modifying designs and processes. Many products manufactured after modification do not immediately reveal their defects, which can easily lead to a situation where short-term savings and apparent achievements result in irreparable losses. From this perspective, handling modifications with caution is of particular importance.
    This is not meant to discourage those who are enthusiastically modifying designs. It should be acknowledged that many people understand the importance of caution. However, despite this, some problems have arisen in the work of modifying designs and processes. Some of these problems have only just begun to surface, but they are certainly worth our attention.
    When modifying designs, some factories pay close attention to visiting users and going deep into the field to systematically observe and study the machines being modified. Those who have done this have obtained the users' assistance and have based their work on a more reliable foundation. However, due to insufficient attention to this aspect in some factories, the results have been counterproductive. The aim of saving raw materials has been "achieved," but the products have either had to be reworked and repaired or completely remade, which is truly a case of being penny-wise and pound-foolish. A machinery factory in Shenyang City manufactured a product according to modified drawings, but the product's lifespan was affected due to improper modifications. As a result, the product was returned by the user. Such incidents could have been completely avoided if more attention had been paid to listening to users' opinions and consulting with them beforehand.
    Some factories have been able to humbly consult with experienced scientists and engineers from scientific research institutions, universities, and advanced factories and mines. In this way, they have learned from others' strengths, compensated for their own weaknesses, and enriched their knowledge, which has given them more confidence when they start working. However, some factories still appear to be reckless in this regard. They are doing scientific research work, but they are acting rashly and not using a scientific approach. A factory in Shenyang planned to use carbon steel instead of alloy steel for tools. Before the testing work had produced a final evaluation, the factory issued a manufacturing order. As a result, the quality was found to be too poor for use, causing several thousand yuan in losses. Obviously, this loss could have been avoided.
    Some factories, through modifying designs and processes, have not only ensured quality but have also improved product performance. Machines that originally had only one use have been transformed into machines with several uses. The efficiency of some machines has also been improved compared to the past. This is a very welcome phenomenon because it not only saves raw materials but also raises technical levels. However, contrary to the above situation, some factories have saved raw materials but have also reduced the quality of their products, which is absolutely not allowed. An electrical machinery factory planned to save 14,000 yuan per year on a certain product, but it did so by reducing quality. Although this matter was later stopped, the current situation, in which the quality of some factories is not stable enough, is indeed worrying.
    Scientific and technological work requires absolute adherence to the principle of seeking truth from facts. Even a little carelessness can lead to incalculable consequences. Someone said: Is it possible to eat without dropping a grain of rice? The implication is that is it possible to do work without making mistakes or having shortcomings? Of course, it is difficult to avoid mistakes and shortcomings when doing work, but if you know that recklessness will inevitably lead to mistakes, why must you be reckless? It's like not dropping a grain of rice while eating, which is actually completely possible.

    修改设计必须慎重
    陆灏
    为了节约原材料，沈阳市许多机械、电机制造部门从具体情况出发，创造性地把产品的设计和工艺加以改进，不但节约了很多钢材，有的还提高了产品的性能，使工厂的技术水平得到了提高，这对于加速祖国社会主义工业化有着很大的意义。但修改设计，修改工艺是件极其复杂和细致的工作，如果稍有不慎，就会召来极其严重的后果。现在，机械、电机工业部门，正在大量地进行修改设计、修改工艺的工作；经过修改以后制造出来的许多产品，有的毛病并不是一下子就能看出来的，这就很容易造成现在看起来是节约，成绩很大；但结果却造成了难以弥补的损失。从这一点上来说，慎重从事，就具有特别重要的意义。
    这倒并不是故意要在很多热心修改设计的人的头上泼冷水。应该承认，关于谨慎的道理是很多人所了解的。但是，尽管如此，修改设计，修改工艺的工作还是发生了一些问题，有的虽然只是刚刚露了一点点苗头，但它确实很值得引起我们的注意。
    有的工厂在修改设计的时候，很注意访问用户，深入现场，对于被修改的机器进行系统的观察和研究。凡是这样做的，他们都取得了用户的帮助，并把自己的工作建立在比较可靠的基础上。但是，由于有的工厂在这方面注意不够，结果弄巧成拙，节约原材料的目的算是“达到”了，但产品却轻则返工重修，重则从头再来，真是得不偿失。沈阳市一个机械工厂，有一种产品按照修改的图纸制造出来以后，送到了使用部门，因为修改不当，影响了产品的寿命，结果被用户退了回来。这样的事情如果事先能够多倾听用户的意见，多和用户商量，本来是完全可以避免的。
    有的工厂由于能够虚心地向科学研究机关，高等学校以及先进厂矿的有经验的科学家和工程师请教，这样，他们就取得了别人的长处，弥补了自己的缺陷，从而丰富了自己的知识，动起手来，就比较有把握。但是，有的工厂在这方面还表现得很莽撞，他们做的是科学研究工作，但他们却轻举妄动，不是用科学的态度办事。沈阳有一个工厂打算用炭素钢代替合金钢做工具，试验工作尚未做出最后鉴定，厂里就下达了制造的命令，结果发现质量太次，不能使用，造成了几千元的损失。显而易见，这种损失本来也是可以避免的。
    有的工厂通过修改设计，修改工艺的结果，不但保证了质量，还提高了产品的性能。本来只有一种用途的机器，变成为有几种用途的机器；有的机器的效率也比过去提高了。这不但节约了原材料，也提高了技术水平，这是一种十分可喜的现象。但和上述情况相反，有的工厂虽然节约了原材料；但同时却把产品的质量降低了，这当然是绝对不能允许的。有一个电机工厂，在某种产品上计划每年节约一万四千元，结果采取了降低质量的办法。虽然这件事情后来被制止了，但就目前情况来看，某些工厂质量不够稳定的情形确实令人担忧。
    科学技术工作万分需要实事求是，一点点粗心大意就会带来难以估计的恶果。有人说：吃饭还能不掉米粒吗？意思是说，做工作还能不发生缺点吗？当然，做工作难免发生错误和缺点，但明知道蛮干就必然弄错，为什么一定非蛮干不可呢？这好比吃饭不掉米粒，实际上是完全可以做到的。
