The basic completion of the socialist cooperativization of agriculture has made our worker-peasant alliance established on a more powerful and more solid foundation—the socialist system of ownership by the whole people and the system of collective ownership. This great change in the foundation of our worker-peasant alliance marks the victory of our socialist revolution and the new development of the worker-peasant alliance. The victory of our democratic revolution and socialist revolution is inseparable from the continuous consolidation and development of the worker-peasant alliance led by the working class; similarly, the victory of our socialist construction requires the further consolidation and development of the worker-peasant alliance. Consolidating and developing the worker-peasant alliance is the most fundamental guarantee for building socialism.

The importance of the worker-peasant alliance is rarely doubted. However, not everyone fully understands the labor and living conditions of workers and peasants, as well as their contributions to national construction, and there are even some misunderstandings. This is detrimental to consolidating and developing the worker-peasant alliance. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze and explain these issues.

Some say, "Agricultural labor is not as important as industrial labor." "Peasant labor is heavy and the pay is low, while worker labor is light and the pay is high. Therefore, it is reasonable for peasants to be uneasy about working in rural areas and to freely flow to the cities." Is this correct? We believe this is incorrect. First of all, it should be affirmed that the labor of workers and peasants is all glorious and indispensable for building socialism. Our socialist industrialization cannot be separated from the upsurge of agriculture and the upsurge of light industry closely related to agriculture. Without the continued upsurge of agriculture and light industry, and without the accumulation of agriculture and light industry for the country, socialist industrialization centered on heavy industry would be unimaginable. At present, in the total industrial output value of our country, the output value using agricultural products as the main raw materials accounts for about 50%; agricultural and sideline products and industrial products made from agricultural raw materials account for about 90% of the main commodity supply in the domestic market, and about 75% of the total export volume. Therefore, the development of agriculture has a significant impact on our national economy. Without the development of agriculture, the speed of industrial development will slow down, and the improvement of people's lives will be adversely affected. Precisely because of this, the proportion of our investment in agriculture in the first Five-Year Plan accounts for 7.6% of the total investment in capital construction, and the execution result will reach 8%, and in the second Five-Year Plan, it is planned to increase to more than 10%. Correspondingly, the ratio of investment in heavy industry and light industry was 7.3 to 1 in the first Five-Year Plan, and the second Five-Year Plan will consider increasing investment in light industry even more. In this way, our heavy industry, agriculture, and light industry will achieve a comprehensive upsurge. However, conversely, the further development of agriculture cannot be separated from the isolated development of industry. Otherwise, farmers will not be able to obtain cheap and high-quality fertilizers, agricultural machinery, water conservancy equipment, and industrial consumer goods. In that case, agriculture will not be able to finally carry out technological transformation, and the lives of farmers will not be fundamentally improved. Therefore, agriculture must rely on the support of industry, and industry must also rely on the help of agriculture. The mutual support and help between industry and agriculture are the basic conditions for the comprehensive development of the national economy and the characteristics of the development of socialist industry and agriculture. Therefore, emphasizing the importance of agricultural labor is of course completely correct and necessary, but it is incorrect to belittle the importance of industrial labor because of this. It is also a misunderstanding to say that "peasant labor is heavy and the pay is low, while worker labor is light and the pay is high." If we must say that there is any difference between worker and peasant labor, then we can only say this: First, the labor of the working class under the conditions of modern machine industry is combined with complex machine operation, so their work is generally more intense. Peasants today do not have or have very few machines, so the intensity of peasant labor is relatively lower than that of workers, but they also have heavier physical labor. Second, the working class works at least 300 or more working days a year, day and night, and works for eight hours of intense labor every day following the rotation of machinery; while peasant labor has a certain intermittency due to the limitations of agricultural production by seasons and natural conditions. Of course, farmers do not want this kind of intermittency, because it reduces their income. But this is an objective reality that is difficult to change for a while. Third, the labor of the working class is generally combined with modern large-scale production, so their labor is more complex; while the labor of peasants is generally simpler under the current situation of relatively backward production technology. Fourth, the labor productivity of industry is much higher than the labor productivity of agriculture, that is to say, workers can create more material wealth than farmers in the same amount of time. Therefore, it is reasonable that workers' monetary income is slightly higher than that of farmers.

Some say, "Farmers have more burdens and make greater contributions to national construction; workers have fewer burdens and make fewer contributions to national construction. The capital construction and urban construction in the past few years have all been built with farmers' grain." This statement is also not in line with the facts. First of all, it should be pointed out that Chinese farmers have made great contributions to China's socialist construction. Farmers pay about 7% of their net income to the state as agricultural tax every year. At the same time, when farmers exchange their agricultural products for industrial products, due to the certain price difference between industrial products and agricultural products, farmers also make a certain contribution to the country's capital accumulation through this price difference. If the 1936 ratio of industrial and agricultural products is taken as the base (it should be pointed out that the 1936 ratio of industrial and agricultural products also had a scissors difference), farmers accumulate about 5% of their net income for the country through price differences. The two items total about 12% of farmers' net income. This is one of the main sources of construction funds in our country in recent years. Another calculation method is that in our country's national budget revenue, the agricultural tax paid by 500 million farmers accounts for about 10%; due to the profits and taxes from the acquisition, processing, sales, and transportation of agricultural and sideline products, it indirectly constitutes about 40% of the national fiscal revenue. Of course, this also includes the value added by production workers, transportation workers, shop assistants, etc., and it is not easy to distinguish how much contribution farmers have made and how much contribution workers have made. This shows the special importance of agriculture in the process of China's socialist industrialization. Anyone who does not see this point will make serious mistakes. However, on the other hand, it should also be seen that the main part of the net output value created by the Chinese working class is handed over to the state for distribution. At the same time, when the working class purchases consumer goods with their wages, they also pay commodity taxes through commodity prices. The main part of the national fiscal budget revenue comes from the working class. The Chinese working class has made outstanding contributions to China's socialist construction. Anyone who does not see this point will also make serious mistakes. It can be seen that the one-sided view that farmers have more burdens and that the national construction funds are all using farmers' money is not in line with the facts. At the same time, it should also be pointed out that the burden on farmers today is greatly reduced compared with before liberation. Before liberation, poor peasants and farm laborers generally had to hand over about 70% of their net income to landlords, usurers, and their ruling institutions, and the rent alone reached 60 billion catties of grain every year; while now farmers only hand over about 12% of their net income directly or indirectly to their own government for their own benefit. At the same time, the price difference between industrial and agricultural products is also constantly narrowing. The purchase price of agricultural products in 1955 was about 10% higher than in 1950, while the price of industrial products basically did not change. Calculating only in 1955 alone, farmers increased their income by about 2 billion yuan because of this. This does not include the increased income of farmers with the development of agricultural production. Everyone knows that the national grain output in 1949 was 220 billion catties, while in 1956 it was 368 billion catties. Since the People's Government has implemented the policy of increasing production without increasing taxes, the grain produced over the years is also owned by the farmers. Therefore, the burden on farmers today cannot be said to be too much, but it has been greatly reduced; the income of farmers has not decreased but has increased significantly.

Some also say: "The state takes more care of workers and helps farmers less. Farmers' lives have not improved, and workers' lives have improved too much." This statement is also not in line with the facts and is incorrect. The fact is that the Party and the state are very concerned about the improvement of the lives of workers and peasants. Since liberation, the lives of workers and peasants have been improved. According to the survey of the Institute of Economics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the average consumption of each farmer in the country in 1936 was 61.2 yuan (all calculated at the constant price in 1952, the same below), and the average consumption of each worker in the country was 130 yuan, and the consumption of workers was 2.12 times that of farmers. After liberation, by 1952, at the end of the economic recovery period, according to the statistics of the State Statistical Bureau, the average consumption of each farmer was 72 yuan, and the average consumption of each worker was 151 yuan, and the consumption of workers was 2.097 times that of farmers; in 1955, the average consumption of each farmer was 78.9 yuan, and the average consumption of each worker was 164.6 yuan, and the consumption of workers was 2.086 times that of farmers; in 1956, the average consumption of each farmer was 81 yuan, and the average consumption of each worker was 179.6 yuan, and the consumption of workers was 2.217 times that of farmers. Of course, the average consumption figures of farmers and workers in the country listed here are only "average", and there are differences in different regions, but through these figures, we can see the general situation of the comparison of the lives of workers and peasants in our country since liberation. Now let's make a comparison: if compared with 1936 before the War of Resistance Against Japan, under the condition of a very high population growth rate, the living standard of workers in 1955 increased by about 26%, and the living standard of farmers increased by about 29%; by 1956, the former increased by about 38%, and the latter increased by about 32%. It can be seen that the lives of workers and peasants have been significantly improved compared with before the War of Resistance Against Japan. In the past few years, the speed of improvement in farmers' lives was faster than that of workers, and in 1956, the speed of improvement in workers' lives was slightly faster than that of farmers. This is mainly because workers' wages increased less in the past two or three years, and after the wage reform in 1956, workers' wages increased by an average of about 13% over the previous year; while in the same year, farmers' production decreased more than planned due to severe disasters, and their income increased less. This is of course a temporary phenomenon that will soon change.

As mentioned above, in terms of currency calculation, the wage income of each worker is about one time higher than the income of farmers. However, in terms of actual consumption level, it is another situation. For example, according to the investigation of the living conditions of Li Yufang, a member of the Daxing Agricultural Cooperative in Youxian County, Hunan Province (who was a hired worker before liberation and is now a well-to-do middle peasant), the total value of the physical objects consumed by Li Yufang's family of six in 1955 was 301 yuan, while the price of the same physical objects converted into Beijing prices was 728.86 yuan, and the price converted into Shanghai prices was 743.86 yuan, which is also more than one time different. This is because the production and life of farmers in our country still have a large nature of self-sufficient economy (at present, farmers' self-sufficient consumption accounts for about 60% of their total consumption), while the consumption of the working class is all paid for by monetary income. Workers living in cities have to spend money on everything, whether it is eating, eating vegetables, drinking water, burning firewood, living in houses, etc.; while farmers living in rural areas are not completely like this. Therefore, it is completely reasonable that workers' income calculated in currency is higher than that of farmers. At the same time, it should be recognized that certain differences in the consumption level of workers and peasants are a product of history. Although this difference will gradually narrow with the continuous development of our country's production and the continuous improvement of the lives of workers and peasants, it will take a long time to achieve this. It can only be achieved under the conditions of greatly developing social productive forces.

It should be seen that it is not accidental that Chinese farmers have been politically liberated and have greatly improved their lives under the leadership of the working class. This is inseparable from the consistent care and assistance of the Party and the government to the farmers. The Party and the government have led the farmers to carry out the great revolutionary war, land reform, and agricultural socialist cooperativization, guiding the farmers onto the great socialist road, and are still continuing to lead the farmers to further consolidate the cooperatives and increase agricultural output. At the same time, the state has also given farmers a series of material assistance. For example, from 1950 to 1956, the state invested more than 2.6 billion yuan in water conservancy construction, distributed 1.31 billion yuan in disaster relief and assistance to farmers, and spent 1.27 billion yuan on promoting improved varieties of agriculture, new agricultural implements, and improving agricultural technology. These three items alone totaled 5.18 billion yuan, which is equal to about one-third of the taxes paid by farmers to the state in seven years. In addition to this, the state has cumulatively lent farmers more than 8 billion yuan in low-interest loans to help farmers develop production and improve their lives. Chinese farmers could not have obtained so many benefits under any dynasty or any system in the past.

Naturally, as a result of the long-term sinful rule of imperialism and domestic reactionary classes in the past, China's economy is still very backward. Since liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the government, and through the efforts of the people of the whole country, this backward situation has begun to change. However, compared with some other advanced countries, the living standards of workers and peasants in our country today are still very low. In order to change this situation, we must concentrate our efforts on socialist construction and do everything possible to develop industrial and agricultural production. In order to fully develop China's industrial and agricultural production, strengthening the education of the worker-peasant alliance, eliminating any illusions between workers and peasants, and constantly consolidating the worker-peasant alliance are extremely important conditions. Only with the continuous development and consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance, and with workers and peasants more closely united, working together, and supporting each other, can our socialist construction cause rapidly develop, and the lives of our people can be continuously improved.

### 工农的劳动都是光荣的  工农的生活都有了改善

    工农的劳动都是光荣的  工农的生活都有了改善
    农业社会主义合作化的基本完成，使我国工农联盟建立在更加强大、更加巩固的基础上——社会主义全民所有制和集体所有制的基础上。我国工农联盟基础的这种伟大变革，标志着我国社会主义革命的胜利和工农联盟的新的发展。我国民主革命和社会主义革命的胜利，是同我国工人阶级所领导的工农联盟的不断巩固和发展分不开的；同样，我国社会主义建设的胜利，更需要工农联盟进一步地巩固和发展。巩固和发展工农联盟，是建设社会主义的最根本的保证。
    工农联盟的重要性是很少有人怀疑的。但是，对于工人和农民的劳动、生活状况以及他们对国家建设的贡献等等问题，并不是所有的人都完全了解，甚至还有某种误解。这对于巩固和发展工农联盟是不利的。因此，有必要对这些问题，加以分析和解释。
    有人说，“农业劳动不如工业劳动重要。”“农民劳动重、报酬低，工人劳动轻、报酬高。所以，农民不安心农村工作，自由向城市流动，是有理由的。”这对不对呢？我们认为这是不对的。首先，应当肯定，工人和农民的劳动都是光荣的，都是建设社会主义所不可缺少的。我国社会主义工业化离不开农业的高涨，离不开同农业密切联系着的轻工业的高涨。没有农业和轻工业的继续高涨，没有农业和轻工业对国家的积累，以重工业为中心的社会主义工业化将是不可设想的。目前我国全部工业产值中，用农产品为主要原料的产值约占50％左右；农副产品和用农业原料制成的工业品，在国内市场主要商品供应量中约占90％左右，在出口总额中约占75％左右。因此，农业的发展，对于我国国民经济有重大影响。没有农业的发展，工业发展的速度就会降低下来，人民生活的改善也就会受到不利的影响。正因为这样，我们在第一个五年计划中对农业投资的比重占基本建设投资总额的7.6％，执行结果将达到8％，在第二个五年计划中，准备提高到10％以上。与此相适应，重工业和轻工业投资的比例，第一个五年计划是七点三比一，第二个五年计划将考虑把轻工业投资再提高些。这样，我国的重工业、农业、轻工业，就将获得全面的高涨。但是，反过来说，农业要更进一步地发展，也不能脱离工业而孤立地发展。否则，农民就得不到价廉物美的肥料、农业机械、水利设备和工业消费品。那样，农业也就不可能最终地进行技术改造，农民的生活也就不可能得到根本的改善。所以，农业必须依靠工业的支援，工业也必须依靠农业的帮助。工业和农业的相互支援和帮助，是国民经济全面发展的基本条件，是社会主义工农业发展的特点。因此，强调农业劳动的重要性当然是完全正确的和必要的，但因此而贬低工业劳动的重要性，则是不正确的。说“农民劳动重、报酬低，工人劳动轻、报酬高”，也是一种误解。如果一定要说工农劳动有什么不同，那么，我们只能够这样说：第一，工人阶级的劳动在现代机器工业的条件下，是跟复杂的机器操作相结合的，因此，他们的工作一般是比较紧张的。农民今天还没有或者很少有机器，因此，农民劳动的紧张程度，要比工人相对地低一些，但是他们也有较重的体力劳动。第二，工人阶级不分昼夜，每年至少要做三百个以上的工作日，每日要跟着机械的转动做八小时的紧张劳动；而农民的劳动，则因农业生产受季节和自然条件的限制，有一定的间歇性。当然，农民并不愿意有这种间歇，因为它减低了农民的收入。但这是一个客观的现实，一时间还难于改变。第三，工人阶级的劳动，因为一般是同现代大生产相结合的，因此，他们的劳动是比较复杂的；而农民的劳动，在目前生产技术还比较落后的情况下，一般是比较简单的。第四，工业的劳动生产率大大高于农业的劳动生产率，也就是说，在同一时间内，工人比农民能够创造更多的物质财富。所以，工人所得的货币收入也较农民略高，这也是合理的。
    有人说，“农民的负担多，对国家建设的贡献大；工人的负担少，对国家建设的贡献少。几年来的基本建设和城市建设都是用农民的粮食砌起来的。”这种说法也不合乎事实。首先应该指出，我国农民对于我国的社会主义建设是有巨大贡献的。农民每年约把自己净收入的7％左右作为农业税，缴给国家。同时，农民在以自己的农产品和工业品进行交换的时候，由于工业品和农产品之间有一定的价差，通过这种价差，农民对国家的资金积累也有一定的贡献。如以1936年工农产品比价为基数（应当指出1936年工农产品比价也是有剪刀差的），农民通过价差，大约又要给国家积累约相当于自己净收入的5％左右。两项合计占农民净收入的12％左右。这是我国几年来建设资金的主要来源之一。另外一种计算方法是，在我国的国家预算收入中，五亿农民所缴的农业税约占10％左右；由于农业及其副业产品收购、加工、销售、运输等的利润和税收，间接构成国家财政收入约为40％左右。当然这里也包括了生产工人、运输工人、店员等的加工所追加的价值在内，不容易分清楚农民有多大贡献，工人有多大贡献。由此说明，农业在我国社会主义工业化过程中具有的特殊重要性。谁要是看不到这一点，谁就要犯严重的错误。但是，另一方面，也应该看到，我国工人阶级所创造的净产值的主要部分，是交给国家支配的。同时，工人阶级在以自己的工资购入消费品时，同样也通过商品价格缴纳了商品税。国家财政预算收入的主要部分是来自工人阶级的。我国工人阶级对于我国社会主义建设有卓越的贡献。谁要是看不到这一点，那也会犯严重的错误。可见，那种片面地认为农民负担多，国家建设资金都是使用农民的钱的观点，是不合乎事实的。同时，还应当指出：今天农民对国家的负担，如果同解放以前相比，是大大地减轻了。解放以前贫农和雇农一般要将自己净收入的70％左右交给地主高利贷者及其统治机构，仅地租一项，每年即达六百亿斤粮食；而现在农民只将自己净收入的12％左右直接或间接地交给自己的政府为自己谋福利。同时，工农产品的差价，也在不断缩小。1955年农产品的收购价格就比1950年提高了10％左右，而工业品的价格，则基本上没有变化，仅以1955年一年计算，农民即因此增加二十亿元左右的收入。这还没有把随着农业生产的发展农民所增加的收入包括在内。大家知道，1949年全国的粮食产量是二千二百亿斤，而1956年是三千六百八十亿斤。由于人民政府执行了增产不增税的政策，历年所增产的粮食，也都归农民所有。因此，今天农民的负担不能说是过多，而是大大地减少了；农民的收入，不是减少而是显著地增加了。
    也有人说：“国家照顾工人多，帮助农民少。农民生活没有改善，工人生活改善得太多。”这种说法，也是不符合事实的，不正确的。事实是党和国家对工人和农民生活的改善都是十分关怀的。解放以来，工人和农民的生活都得到了改善。根据中国科学院经济研究所的调查，1936年全国农民每人的平均消费额是六十一点二元，（都按1952年不变价格计算，下同）全国职工每人的平均消费额是一百三十元，职工的消费额为农民的消费额二点一二倍。解放后，到经济恢复时期结束的1952年，根据国家统计局的统计，农民每人的平均消费额是七十二元，职工每人的平均消费额是一百五十一元，职工的消费额为农民的消费额二点零九七倍；1955年农民每人的平均消费额是七十八点九元，职工每人的平均消费额是一百六十四点六元，职工的消费额为农民的消费额二点零八六倍；1956年农民每人的平均消费额是八十一元，职工每人的平均消费额是一百七十九点六元，职工的消费额为农民的消费额二点二一七倍。当然，这里所列举的全国农民和职工的平均消费额数字，只是“平均”的，在不同地区，是有差别的，但是，通过这些数字，可以看出解放以来我国工农生活对比的一般情况。现在就让我们来做个比较吧：如果同抗日战争前的1936年相比，在人口增殖率很高的条件下，1955年工人的生活水平大约提高了26％左右，农民的生活水平大约提高了29％左右；到1956年前者提高38％左右，后者提高32％左右。可见，工人和农民的生活，都比抗日战争前有了显著的提高。前几年农民生活提高的速度快于工人，1956年工人生活提高的速度又略快于农民，这主要是由于前两三年中，工人的工资增加较少，而在1956年进行工资改革后，职工工资较上年平均提高13％左右；而在同年农民则因灾情较重，生产较计划减少，收入增加较少。这当然是一种暂时的现象，很快就会改变的。
    如上所说，以货币计算，工人每人的工资收入大约高于农民的收入一倍多一点。但是，以实际消费水平计算，则是另外一种情形。例如，根据对湖南攸县大兴农业合作社社员李裕芳（解放前是雇工，现在是富裕中农）生活情况的调查，1955年李裕芳全家六口人全年消费的实物折价是三百零一元，而以同样的实物折为北京的价格则为七百二十八元八角六分，折为上海的价格则为七百四十三元八角六分，相差也是一倍多。这是由于我国农民的生产和生活目前还带有很大的自给经济的性质（目前农民自给性消费约占其全部消费额的60％左右），而工人阶级的消费，则全部是靠货币收入来支付的。在城市生活的职工，无论吃饭、吃菜、喝水、烧柴、住房子等等……一举一动都要花钱；而在农村生活的农民，则不完全是这样。所以，工人按货币计算的收入比农民高一些，也是完全合理的。同时，应当认识，工人和农民消费水平的某些差别，是一种历史的产物，虽然这种差别将随着我国生产的不断发展、工农生活的不断改善而日益缩小，但是要消灭这种差别，则需要经过长期奋斗，在大大地发展社会生产力的条件下，才能达到。
    应该看到，我国农民在工人阶级的领导之下，在政治上得到了解放，在生活上获得了很大的改善，决不是偶然的。这是同党和政府对农民的一贯关怀和援助分不开的。党和政府曾经领导农民进行了伟大的革命战争、土地改革和农业社会主义合作化，把农民引导到伟大的社会主义道路上来，并且还在继续领导农民进一步巩固合作社和提高农业产量。同时，国家还给了农民一系列的物质援助，例如，从1950—1956年七年中，国家投入水利建设的经费即达二十六亿余元，发放救灾和救济农民的经费即达十三亿一千万元，用于推广农业的优良品种、新式农具、改良农业技术的经费即达十二亿七千万元，仅此三项共达五十一亿八千万元，等于农民七年中向国家缴纳税款的三分之一左右。除此之外，国家还累计贷给农民八十余亿元的低利贷款，扶助农民发展生产改善生活。我国农民在以往任何朝代和任何制度之下，都不可能获得这么多的利益。
    自然，由于过去帝国主义和国内反动阶级长期罪恶统治的结果，我国的经济还是十分落后的。解放以来，在党和政府的领导下，经过全国人民的努力，这种落后状态，已在开始改变。但是，如果和其它一些先进国家相比，我国工人和农民今天的生活水平，都还是很低的。为了改变这种状况，我们必须集中力量进行社会主义建设，尽一切可能来发展工业和农业生产。而要充分发展我国工业和农业生产，加强工农联盟的教育，消除工农之间的任何错觉，不断地巩固工农联盟，则是一个异常重要的条件。只有工农联盟不断发展和巩固，工人和农民更加亲密团结、共同劳动，相互支援，我国社会主义建设事业才能迅速地发展，我国人民的生活才能不断地改善。
