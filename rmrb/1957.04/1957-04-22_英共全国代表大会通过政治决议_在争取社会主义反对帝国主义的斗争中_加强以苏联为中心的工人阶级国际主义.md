(Comprehensive report from this newspaper) Xinhua News Agency reports: After heated discussions, the 25th National Congress of the British Communist Party, on the 20th, expressed agreement with all the main points of Gollan's political report regarding the party's policies and passed a political resolution.

The discussion mainly focused on six issues. These six issues were: 1. The issue of passing an emergency resolution on the government's defense policy; 2. The issue of a unified working-class party based on Marxism; 3. The issue of election policy; 4. The Hungarian question; 5. The attitude towards the Soviet Union; 6. The issue of revisionism.

During the discussion, the congress showed different opinions and attitudes towards the above issues, but it was basically consistent on major political issues. Regarding the British government's defense policy, the congress unanimously opposed the policy of using nuclear war as Britain's strategic goal, and on the morning of April 20, it passed an emergency resolution condemning this policy, believing that this policy "is suicidal for Britain." The congress "calls for the most powerful movement to force the government to abandon the policy of conducting nuclear war, cancel nuclear weapons tests on Christmas Island, and, together with the Soviet Union, demand a ban on all nuclear weapons, and, until such a ban is achieved, demand the immediate cessation of all nuclear weapons tests through international agreements."

The emergency resolution also calls for reducing the current two-year conscription to twelve months and serving only domestically.

In discussing the second and third topics, speakers emphasized the importance of the Communist Party in the labor movement. An amendment to the draft political resolution regarding the party and the labor movement emphasized that to fundamentally change the labor movement and the Labor Party, it is necessary to establish and strengthen the Communist Party. The Communist Party must obtain its due position in the institutions of the Labor Party.

The amendment stated: "In the struggle against capitalist ideas, in cultivating the class consciousness and militancy of the working class, and in the struggle to win the labor movement's support for a policy of advancing towards socialism, Communists in Parliament and local councils can play an extremely important role together with their Labor Party colleagues. This representation of the Communist Party is extremely important for the transition to socialism and the transformation of parliament."

The Hungarian question and the attitude towards the Soviet Union were the most controversial issues. Some party members attending the congress still had doubts and confused ideas. Some still believed that the actions taken by the Soviet Union in Hungary were wrong. Some said that Gollan's remarks on the Hungarian events were "not impartial." However, the majority of delegates to the congress did not agree with their views. In the debate, delegates repeatedly mentioned the Chinese Communist Party's views on the Soviet Union and the Hungarian events.

The congress finally agreed that revisionism is the "main danger" currently facing the party.

The political resolution passed by the congress stated that the British government is "desperately seeking to save imperialism by harming the interests of the British people and by pursuing a more aggressive policy in the colonies. The consequences of implementing this policy are: underemployment and unemployment, and rising prices and rents." The resolution emphasized that the most important task of the Communist Party is to strengthen the unity of the working class in the struggle for peace and social progress policies.

In terms of foreign policy, the British Communist Party believes that its primary task is to organize the struggle to establish a European security system, to resolve the Middle East issue while respecting the sovereignty of Arab countries and without imperialist interference, to reach an agreement on disarmament and the prohibition of nuclear weapons, to stop colonial wars and withdraw British troops from Kenya, Malaya, Northern Ireland, and Cyprus, to admit the People's Republic of China into the United Nations, and to withdraw American troops from Britain.

The resolution concludes: "The general struggle for socialism against imperialism requires strengthening proletarian internationalism centered on the Soviet Union."

    英共全国代表大会通过政治决议
    在争取社会主义反对帝国主义的斗争中  加强以苏联为中心的工人阶级国际主义
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：英共第二十五届全国代表大会经过热烈的讨论以后，20日对高兰的政治报告中关于党的政策的所有主要之点都表示赞同，并且通过了政治决议。
    讨论主要集中六个问题上。这六个问题是：一、关于就政府的国防政策通过紧急决议的问题；二、以马克思主义为基础的统一的工人阶级政党的问题；三、选举政策问题；四、匈牙利问题；五、对苏联的态度问题；六、修正主义问题。
    代表大会在讨论过程中表现出对上列各项问题存在着不同的意见和态度，但是在重大的政治问题上，基本上是一致的。关于英国政府的国防政策问题，在这个问题上，代表大会一致反对以进行原子核战争为英国的战略目标的政策，并且在4月20日上午通过紧急决议谴责这种政策，认为这种政策“对英国说来是一种自杀”。代表大会“号召展开最有力的运动，强迫政府放弃进行原子核战争的政策，取消圣诞岛的原子核武器试验，同苏联一起要求禁止一切原子核武器，并且在这种禁止实现以前要求通过国际协定立即停止一切原子核武器试验”。
    紧急决议还要求把目前的两年征兵制减少到十二个月，并且只在国内服役。
    在讨论第二个和第三个议题时，发言的人都强调指出共产党在劳工运动中的重要性。政治决议草案中关于党和劳工运动问题的修正案强调指出，要使劳工运动和工党发生根本性改变，就必须建立和加强共产党。共产党必须在工党的机构中取得它应有的地位。
    修正案说：“在反对资本主义思想的斗争中，在培养工人阶级的阶级觉悟和战斗性的时候，在争取劳工运动支持向社会主义前进的政策的斗争中，议会和地方议会中的共产党人能够和他们的工党同事一起，起极为重要的作用。共产党的这种代表权对于向社会主义过渡和改变议会是极其重要的。”
    匈牙利问题和对苏联的态度问题是争论最多的问题。出席代表大会的某些党员还存在着怀疑和混乱思想。有些人仍然认为苏联在匈牙利采取的行动是错误的。有人说高兰关于匈牙利事件的话“并非持平之论”。但是，代表大会的大多数代表不赞成他们的看法。在辩论中，代表们曾经一再提到中国共产党关于苏联和匈牙利事件的意见。
    代表大会最后同意修正主义是党目前面临的“主要危险”。
    代表大会通过的政治决议说，英国政府“靠着损害英国人民的利益并且靠着在殖民地执行更富侵略性的政策，不顾死活地力求挽救帝国主义。执行这种政策的后果是：出现工时不足的工作周和失业现象，物价和房租日益高涨。”决议着重指出，共产党最主要的任务是在争取和平和社会进步政策的斗争中加强工人阶级的团结。
    在外交政策方面，英国共产党认为它的首要任务是组织斗争，争取建立欧洲安全体系，争取在尊重阿拉伯国家主权和没有帝国主义干涉的情况下解决中东问题，争取达成裁军、禁止原子武器的协议，争取停止殖民战争并且从怯尼亚、马来亚、北爱尔兰和塞浦路斯撤出英国军队，争取接纳中华人民共和国进入联合国，并且争取使美国军队撤出英国。
    决议最后说：“争取社会主义反对帝国主义的总斗争要求加强以苏联为中心的工人阶级国际主义”。
