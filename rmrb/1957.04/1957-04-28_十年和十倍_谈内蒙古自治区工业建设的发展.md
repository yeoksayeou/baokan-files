Editor's Note: The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is the earliest autonomous region in China to implement ethnic regional autonomy. It has been exactly ten years since its establishment on May 1, 1947. Over the past ten years, under the leadership of the Party and the government, the people of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region have made great achievements in various constructions, and the face of the Autonomous Region has undergone fundamental changes. The Mongolian people have realized their right to be masters of their own affairs and manage the affairs of their own nation. The various ethnic groups within the Autonomous Region are becoming more and more united on an equal footing. Agriculture and animal husbandry have greatly developed. Industrial construction has grown from nothing to something, from small to large, and new cities are constantly emerging. Commercial trade is becoming increasingly active. The downward trend of the population has been curbed and is beginning to flourish. Cultural education and other undertakings have also made great leaps forward. The Autonomous Region's various democratic reforms and socialist transformations have also achieved decisive victories. The construction achievements of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are the pride of the Mongolian people and all ethnic groups in China, and at the same time, a great victory for the Party's ethnic policies.

	Ten Years and Tenfold
	On the Development of Industrial Construction in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
	Quan Xingyuan, Minister of Industry Department of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China

	In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which historically had almost no industry, industrial construction has developed rapidly over the past ten years through the efforts of the people of all ethnic groups in the Autonomous Region.

	Now, there is the rapidly developing Greater Khingan Range forest industrial base; the Baotou Iron and Steel Industrial Base is under construction; the Ji (Ning) Er (Lian) Railway, connecting China, the Soviet Union, and Mongolia, was opened to traffic and joint transportation last year; the Bao (tou) Lan (zhou) Railway, directly connecting the Lanzhou industrial base in the northwest of the motherland, is also under intense construction; the Baotou Sugar Factory and the Hailar and Pingdiquan meat joint processing plants have been put into production one after another; sugar factories in Hohhot and the Hetao area are under preparation. Local industry has also developed greatly. Sixteen agricultural tool manufacturing and repair factories and pastoral machinery factories, together with handicraft cooperatives throughout the region, have formed 390 agricultural tool repair stations (groups). Dairy, leather, and wool textile industries, which are closely related to animal husbandry production, have also developed rapidly. In 1949, the entire Autonomous Region had only one dairy processing plant with only two or three kinds of products. Now, the entire dairy industry has 1,000 employees and 40 large and small processing plants. In the leather industry, the Hailar Leather Factory has been equipped with advanced technology, and the Baotou Leather Factory has been expanded. The Xilingol League, which could only export raw hides in the past, has now established a leather factory in Xilinhot; herdsmen can now manufacture their favorite fragrant cowhide boots and saddles locally. In Hohhot, in addition to the existing wool textile factory, a new 3,600-spindle wool textile factory is being built and can be put into production this year. To meet the needs of the Autonomous Region's construction, the building materials industry increased more than sixteen times from 1952 to 1956. Industries such as printing, clothing, shoemaking, and food have also increased two to six times. The Autonomous Region also has a part of the industry, such as Chifeng Pharmaceutical Factory, Yakeshi Liquor Factory, Ik Zhao League's Alkali Factory and Sulfur Mine, Zhaowuda League's Gem Mine, and mica asbestos industry distributed in Pingdiquan area and Ulanqab League. Although the sales of their products in the Autonomous Region are very small, they are needed by the country, and we have also given them active support to enable them to develop. In addition, the Autonomous Region has also actively developed the power industry and the coal industry.

	In 1947, the total industrial and handicraft output value of the entire Inner Mongolia region was more than 53 million yuan. By the end of 1956, it had increased to more than 580 million yuan, an increase of more than ten times compared with 1947. The main products of local industry only numbered 44 in 1947, and in 1956 they had increased to 232.

	The development of industrial construction is changing the face of the Autonomous Region.

	The ranks of the working class have grown. At the end of 1956, there were more than 70,000 workers and staff in industrial and mining enterprises throughout the region, an increase of 6.6 times compared with 1947; there were also more than 80,000 workers and staff in state-owned and local state-owned construction and installation enterprises. The living standards of workers and staff have also gradually improved. The average wage of workers and staff in 1956 increased 1.3 times compared with 1949, and the housing for workers and staff increased by more than 1.89 million square meters from 1952 to 1956. It should be particularly pointed out that the Mongolian people, who historically had almost no handicraft workers, have begun to have their own working class. According to preliminary statistics, there are now about 8,000 Mongolian and other ethnic minority workers and staff in factories and mines. There are now nearly 400 Mongolian students in the technical school of Baotou Iron and Steel Company.

	Some of the original small consumer cities in the Autonomous Region are gradually becoming productive cities, and new towns have appeared in many barren rural areas. The new urban area of Baotou, which was still a barren wasteland two years ago, has initially taken shape as a city. Erlian, Saihantala, and Tumurtai, which originally had no or very few households, have become prosperous towns due to the construction and opening of the Jier Road. In the deep mountains and dense forests of the Greater Khingan Range, there were few people in the past, but now it has more than 300 kilometers of railways, more than 20,000 forestry workers and staff, and eight towns with more than 5,000 people.

	In the past few years, the factories in the Autonomous Region have produced more than 160,000 various large and medium-sized agricultural tools, and many agricultural and animal husbandry products and sideline products can be processed in the Autonomous Region. This has supported agricultural and animal husbandry production and increased the income of farmers and herdsmen. The dairy industry alone processed more than 66,000 tons of milk from 1950 to 1956, and the milk fee income of herdsmen and pastures was nearly 10 million yuan, which could buy more than 330,000 pieces of fine white cloth or more than 600,000 sheep.

	The more than 42,000 handicraft workers throughout the region, who have been cooperativized, play a significant role in supporting the production and life of farmers and herdsmen. According to incomplete statistics in 1956, they repaired and assembled more than 190,000 new-style agricultural tools and more than 210,000 old-style agricultural tools in one year, and manufactured more than 40 kinds of new-style agricultural tool parts, totaling more than 230,000 pieces. In pastoral areas, the development of handicrafts can also help the formation of economic centers. Most of the handicraft workers who have been active in pastoral areas have been mobile populations who come in spring and leave in autumn. Now, due to cooperativization, some have begun to settle in pastoral areas and take out their savings to build simple houses. The more than 30 pastoral economic centers that have been initially formed have all proved that this practice is conducive to changing the face of pastoral areas.

	The Autonomous Region's contribution to the construction of the motherland will increase day by day. If Inner Mongolia could only export raw materials in history, it is different now. The Autonomous Region now supplies the country with tens of thousands of tons of sugar and meat, hundreds of tons of dairy products, and a large number of sulfur, caustic soda, mica, asbestos, fluorite, leather, and other products every year. The supply of timber has reached more than 6.8 million cubic meters in recent years. If all these timbers are made into sleepers, they can pave more than 24,000 kilometers of railways.

	After the construction of the second and third five-year plans, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, located on the northern border of the motherland, will not only have highly developed agriculture and animal husbandry, and be able to supply the country with more grain, livestock, fur, and other agricultural and animal husbandry products every year, but also supply the country with a large amount of steel, machinery, coal, timber, and more light industrial products—woolen textiles, sugar, meat, dairy products, etc. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will become an important industrial base of the motherland.

	The people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region deeply feel that the above-mentioned achievements are brought about by the great ethnic policy and socialist industrialization policy of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao. These achievements also show that the leadership organs of the Autonomous Region have correctly implemented the Party's policies.

	The heroic labor of the broad masses of workers and staff is the basic source of the above-mentioned achievements. In the past few years, through various struggles and studies, the political consciousness and technical and cultural level of workers and staff of all ethnic groups have been significantly improved. They have shown a high degree of political enthusiasm and labor initiative in the movement to increase production and practice economy, socialist emulation, and advanced producers, demonstrating the sense of responsibility of the working class as masters of the country. They exposed waste, criticized bureaucracy, put forward active suggestions, improved production technology, and created greater achievements year by year in their work. From 1952 to 1956 alone, workers and staff in local industry put forward more than 65,000 rationalization proposals, and the ones that have been implemented have created a value of more than 76 million yuan. The labor productivity of workers has also increased by 1.9 times in seven years (1949-1956).

	Although the industrial construction of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has made great progress in recent years, the level of industrial development in the Autonomous Region is still very low. There are also some shortcomings and problems in the industrial construction work. Therefore, we must continue to make a series of major efforts, conduct in-depth investigation and research, strengthen the leadership of the Party, rely on the masses, sum up past experiences and lessons, continue to carry forward the fine tradition of building the country diligently and frugally, opposing extravagance and waste, and comprehensively carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, and strive to further develop the Autonomous Region's industrial construction.

    十年和十倍
    谈内蒙古自治区工业建设的发展
    中共内蒙古自治区委员会工业部部长　权星垣
    在历史上几乎没有工业的内蒙古自治区，十年来，经过自治区各族人民的努力，工业建设已迅速发展起来。
    现在，这里有迅速发展着的大兴安岭森林工业基地；有正在建设的包头钢铁工业基地；连接中、苏、蒙三国的集（宁）二（连）铁路去年已经通车联运；直通祖国西北兰州工业基地的包（头）兰（州）铁路又在紧张施工；包头糖厂和海拉尔、平地泉两个肉类联合加工厂已经先后投入生产；呼和浩特、河套地区的糖厂正在筹建。地方工业也有很大发展。十六个农具制造修配厂和牧业机械厂同遍布全区的手工业合作社一起，组成了三百九十个农具修配站（组）。同牧业生产有密切联系的乳品、皮革、毛织工业发展也很迅速。1949年，全自治区只有一个乳品加工厂，只有两三种产品，现在整个乳品工业已经拥有一千名职工、四十个大小加工厂了。在皮革工业方面，以先进技术装备了海拉尔皮革厂，扩大了包头皮革厂。过去只能输出原皮的锡林郭勒盟，现在已经在锡林浩特建立了皮革厂；牧民们喜爱的香牛皮靴子和马鞍具，能够就地制造了。呼和浩特除原有的毛织厂以外，现在正在新建一座三千六百锭的毛织厂，今年可以投入生产。适应自治区建设的需要，建筑材料工业从1952年到1956年发展了十六倍多。印刷、被服、制鞋、食品等工业也都有二倍到六倍的增长。自治区还有这样一部分工业，像赤峰制药厂、牙克石色酒厂、伊克昭盟的制碱厂和硫磺矿、昭乌达盟的宝石矿，以及分布在平地泉区和乌兰察布盟的云母石棉工业等，它们的产品在自治区内虽然销量很少，但是为国家所需要，我们也给予了积极的支持，使他们得到发展。另外，自治区还积极发展了电力工业和煤炭工业。
    在1947年的时候，内蒙古全区工业和手工业总产值是五千三百多万元，到1956年底就增加到五亿八千多万元，比1947年增长十倍以上。地方工业的主要产品，在1947年才有四十四种，1956年已经增加到二百三十二种。
    工业建设的发展，正在改变着自治区的面貌。
    工人阶级队伍壮大了。1956年底，全区有工矿企业职工七万多人，比1947年增长六点六倍；国营、地方国营建筑安装企业的职工，还有八万多人。职工生活也逐步得到改善。1956年职工平均工资比1949年增长一点三倍，职工住宅从1952年到1956年，增加了一百八十九万多平方公尺。特别应该指出的是：历史上连手工业工人几乎都没有的蒙古民族，已经开始有了自己的工人阶级。据初步统计，厂矿企业内蒙古族和境内其他少数民族的职工，现在约有八千多人。在包头钢铁公司的技工学校里，现在有将近四百名蒙古族学生。
    自治区原有的一些消费性的小城市，正在逐步变成生产性的城市，许多荒野农村出现了新的城镇。两年前还是一片荒滩野地的包头新市区，已经初具城市规模，原来没有人家或只有很少住户的二连、赛汗塔拉、土木尔台，由于集二路的修筑和通车，已经变成了繁荣的城镇。在大兴安岭的深山密林里，过去人烟很少，现在已经拥有三百多公里铁路、二万多林业职工，出现了八个五千人以上的市镇。
    几年来，自治区的工厂生产了各种大中型农具十六万多件，很多农畜产品和副业产品都可以在自治区内加工了。这就支持了农牧业生产，增加了农牧民的收入。仅乳品工业从1950年到1956年就处理奶六万六千多吨，牧民和牧场收入的牛奶费近一千万元，可买三十三万多匹细白布或六十多万只羊。
    遍布全区、已经合作化了的四万二千多手工业者，在支援农牧民生产生活方面的作用是很大的。据1956年的不完全统计，一年来共修配新式农具十九万多件，旧式农具二十一万多件，制造出新式农具的零件四十多种、二十三万多件。在牧业区，手工业的发展，还可以帮助经济中心点的形成。历来在牧区活动的手工业者大部分是春来秋去的流动人口，现在由于合作化，有的已经开始固定在牧区，拿出积累建筑简单房屋。现在已经初步形成的三十多个牧区经济中心点，都证明这种作法有利于改变牧区的面貌。
    自治区对祖国建设的贡献将日益增大。如果说历史上内蒙古只能输出原料的话，那末现在就不同了。自治区现在每年以上万吨的砂糖、肉食，成百吨的乳制品和大批硫磺、烧碱、云母、石棉、萤石、皮革等产品供应国家需要。木材供应量几年来已达六百八十多万立方公尺，如把这些木材全部作成枕木，可以铺二万四千多公里的铁路。
    经过第二个、第三个五年计划的建设以后，处在祖国北部边疆的内蒙古自治区将不仅有高度发达的农业、牧业，每年能供给国家以更多的粮食、牲畜、皮毛等农畜产品，她还将以大量的钢铁、机械、煤炭、木材和更多的轻工业产品——毛纺织品、食糖、肉类乳制品等供应国家的需要。内蒙古自治区将成为祖国的一个重要的工业基地。
    内蒙古自治区各族人民深切感到，上述成绩是由中国共产党、中央人民政府、毛主席的伟大民族政策和社会主义工业化政策带来的。这些成绩也说明自治区的领导机关是正确执行了党的政策的。
    广大职工的英勇劳动，是上述成绩的基本源泉。几年来，各族职工经过各种斗争和学习，政治觉悟和技术文化水平都有了显著提高，在增产节约运动和社会主义竞赛、先进生产者运动中发挥了高度的政治热情和劳动积极性，显示了工人阶级国家主人翁的责任感。他们在工作中揭发浪费、批评官僚主义，提出积极建议，改进生产技术，创造的成绩一年比一年大。仅地方工业职工从1952年到1956年，就提出合理化建议六万五千多件，已经实现的共创造价值七千六百多万元，工人劳动生产率，七年间（1949—1956年）也提高了一点九倍。
    内蒙古自治区的工业建设几年来虽然有很大发展，但是现在自治区的工业发展水平还是很低的。在工业建设工作中也还有若干缺点和问题。因此，我们必须继续做一系列的重大努力，深入调查研究，加强党的领导，依靠群众，总结过去的经验教训，继续发扬勤俭建设、艰苦朴素的优良传统，反对铺张浪费，全面开展增产节约运动，为进一步发展自治区的工业建设而奋斗。（附图片）
