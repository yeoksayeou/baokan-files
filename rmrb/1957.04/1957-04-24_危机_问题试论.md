　　Preliminary Discussion on the "Crisis" Problem
　　Yan Xiu
　　On April 11th, the People's Daily published an article by Comrade Hui Chun entitled "The New Crisis of Essays." The editors said that they wanted everyone to discuss it to facilitate the future development of essays. I am actually not qualified to participate in the discussion. Although I have written a few short articles, due to the nature of my work, I rarely read things in this area and cannot express systematic opinions like Comrade Hui Chun. I can only talk about some scattered thoughts.

　　First of all, I am more optimistic than Comrade Hui Chun about the current situation of essays or miscellaneous essays (I myself divide these two slightly, calling those with more lyrical qualities essays, and those with more critical and combative qualities miscellaneous essays; of course, this is only relative. The objects I refer to below are mainly miscellaneous essays as I define them). I do not think that miscellaneous essays are currently facing any particularly large crisis. Comrade Hui Chun said: "Now, I see that essays are facing a new crisis because they have many contradictions that have not been correctly resolved." (The author gives examples, listing seven difficulties or seven contradictions.) "These many contradictions have created a new crisis for essays: a crisis of extinction." I am somewhat surprised by this. If, from the perspective of the twenty years since the Anti-Japanese War, as the author says, then since the slogan of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" was put forward last year, essays or miscellaneous essays can be said to have truly begun to flourish. In the long period before this upsurge, this literary form or writing style was indeed used very little in the base areas and in the whole country after liberation, and was almost dying out. But last year, with the call for contention and blooming, essays or miscellaneous essays also revived (of course, the People's Daily often having one on the front page of the eighth edition played a big role). In the past, this form, under the use of Mr. Lu Xun, became the most effective dart and dagger against the enemy. Once the people gained power, there was indeed a feeling of not knowing how to start. In the base areas, a few people had used this form to write articles, but they were either vicious slanders against the Communist Party (in Yan'an) or used as weapons against the Soviet Union and communism (in the Northeast) (of course, it is not that this form is destined to be like this, but that these few individuals with ulterior motives happened to choose this form). These rather special examples have made some writers reluctant to easily try this form, and have also created a certain impression among many readers: as soon as they hear the word "miscellaneous essay," they worry that someone with bad ideological consciousness is ranting again. Therefore, this form was not fully utilized for more than a decade or two. Precisely because of this, it has not been possible to hone several pens in this area, so that the strength is weak after the revival of miscellaneous essays last year. If we want to talk about "crisis," I think the main crisis lies here: not being able to come up with a lot of good stuff. Since last year, which newspaper or magazine has not attached considerable importance to essays, miscellaneous essays, essays, or something like a few day's talk, and some commentaries on actual work have also adopted this form. Therefore, I think Comrade Hui Chun's assessment of the overall situation of essays is worth reconsidering.

　　Secondly, Comrade Hui Chun raised a "fundamental contradiction" issue, and I think it is indeed necessary to clarify this issue. Raising this question is very helpful to everyone. Comrade Hui Chun relayed the reasons of some people, saying that essays "are products of an undemocratic era. Now it is already a socialist democratic era; then, is there any reason for the existence of such essays? This is a fundamental question." This theory has been expressed by some people, but it has never become a formal theory, and the leaders of the Party's ideological and literary work have never expressed this opinion. In Yan'an, some individuals once put forward the slogan "Now is still the era of miscellaneous essays," which was met with relatively widespread refutation. But everyone can see that refuting this slogan is not the same as promoting the theory that essays are not allowed to exist under the people's regime or in the socialist era. Comrade Hui Chun certainly does not agree with this theory, and I also do not agree with this theory; on this point, we are consistent. However, Hui's article seems to affirm that the current fundamental contradiction is objectively caused by this theory, which I think is highly debatable. In fact, this theory has gradually "self-destructed" rather than essays or miscellaneous essays "self-destructing." Facts speak louder than words. In the past year, more than ten thousand such articles have been published in newspapers and periodicals across the country (because one newspaper has published hundreds or even hundreds of articles). It is untenable to say that there is no freedom of speech for miscellaneous essays. But has anyone written an article saying that the current era does not allow the existence of miscellaneous essays? I don't think so. As for people who hold this theory, it is only a kind of suspicion, and I have not heard of anyone who has insisted on this theory.

　　The incorrectness of this theory is simply beyond refutation. Because, if it is said that essays are mostly satirical and mostly critical and should not exist, then what about the entire satirical literature? What about cartoons? The logical conclusion must be that everything must be cancelled, and finally all literary forms must be cancelled. Because novels, dramas, and movies, not to mention literary and artistic forms such as crosstalk, are inseparable from criticism and satire. Therefore, this theory simply cannot be opened, and once opened, it is asking for trouble and is bound to be unlucky. In addition, there is the rebuttal of facts. Didn't Gorky write his essays greatly in the socialist era? However, his essays are longer and are called political essays, but they are actually the same thing. Another fact is that the practice in the past year has shown that essays and miscellaneous essays are basically welcomed by the majority of readers (including the vast majority of responsible cadres). Therefore, I think that the issue of the contradictions of the times does not exist, and this theory has no power. Comrade Hui Chun raised this issue, obviously intending to cause controversy. It gives us an opportunity to refute this incorrect and one-sided view, and we should thank him for it.

　　Again, Comrade Hui Chun also cited the remaining six contradictions or six difficulties in writing essays or miscellaneous essays. On this issue, I think we should observe it from two aspects. On the one hand, these situations have indeed been encountered in different situations and by different authors, and have indeed created many difficulties in writing miscellaneous essays. On this point, we must criticize and fight. This one-sided pursuit of perfection does exist among some comrades who are engaged in ideological, propaganda, and literary leadership work because they themselves have conservatism, dogmatism, and personal gain issues. They turn a blind eye to new things. They want to maintain prestige and the situation solely on the basis of seniority, upper-level trust, and the idea that "left" is better than right. Under these circumstances, a person who raises issues more sharply will always encounter some obstacles. Comrade Hui Chun focused on raising these issues, and also focused on criticizing those comrades who only look at the issue one-sidedly, so I think this is of positive significance. On the other hand, I think this is somewhat exaggerating the problem. First, these obstacles are only encountered in individual aspects of individual articles. Second, essays in the past year have not actually encountered so many obstacles. Why are there still so many sharp "darts" and "daggers" published now? This shows that they have finally broken through the difficulties and embarked on a fighting post. In addition, these points have another positive significance, which is to tell the authors of essays or miscellaneous essays to think more about avoiding the problem of one-sidedness. If miscellaneous essays can advocate one-sidedness, miscellaneous essays will only have a dead end. Not only will those who oppose one-sidedness oppose it, but even those who advocate one-sidedness will oppose it. If you don't believe it, you can practice the theory of those who advocate one-sidedness and try to write a one-sided criticism of those who advocate one-sidedness. It would be strange if they didn't get angry.

　　Finally, I would like to add that the authors of essays or miscellaneous essays should have a spirit of self-criticism, a spirit of admitting that they may also make mistakes, and should have the generosity to tolerate others. Don't always feel that the environment is not satisfactory, there is no freedom of speech, or that "big cadres" are causing trouble. They should consider that since you can write your essays in newspapers and magazines, why can't people discuss your articles below? If discussing it affects your writing mood, that is being obstructed, then it is too delicate. Essay writers are the first to advocate bold criticism, so they must also allow others to boldly criticize you. If the other party's criticism is very wrong, you can also express your opinion in newspapers and magazines again. So the fundamental question is whether the issue you see is accurate and whether it is beneficial to our society.

　　My conclusion is that obstacles do exist, and we must fight against that kind of incorrect interference. However, objective obstacles currently do not constitute a danger of essays disappearing. Rather, the current situation is a good environment for the development of essays, as long as the authors behave well, do not act as "small ornaments," do not engage in "moaning without illness," do not be one-sidedly "cynical," and do not scold people casually, then the majority of readers will protect you. We should and can write essays or miscellaneous essays that everyone loves to read, even those who originally hated them will slowly love to read them; in this way, essays can avoid crises. As for the fact that some essays may still make mistakes in the future, that is inevitable, but this is not the crisis of the entire essay.

    “危机”问题试论
　  严秀
    4月11日人民日报发表了一篇回春同志的“小品文的新危机”的文章，编者同志说，要大家来讨论讨论，以利于今后小品文的发展。我其实是没有资格来参加讨论的，虽然我写过几篇短文章，但是由于我的工作的性质，我很少看这方面的东西，不能像回春同志那样发表有系统的意见，只能谈点零星的感想。
    首先，我对于目前小品文或杂文（在我自己是把这二者稍微划分了一下的，即把抒情性质多一些的称为小品文，而把批评性、战斗性强一些的称为杂文，当然这只是相对的。以下我所指的对象主要是我所说的杂文）所处的境遇，比回春同志要乐观一些。我不觉得杂文在目前有什么特别大的危机。回春同志说：“现在，我看到小品文正面临着一个新的危机，因为它有许多矛盾尚未正确地解决。”（作者举例，提出七点困难或者七个矛盾。）
  “这样的许多矛盾，就造成了小品文的新危机：消亡的危机。”对这点，我多少有点惊异。如果，从作者所说的从抗日战争以来的二十年看，那么，从去年“百花齐放、百家争鸣”口号提出以后，小品文或者杂文，可说是真正的开始兴旺起来了。在这次的热潮掀起以前的长时期中，这种文学形式或者写作形式在根据地与解放后的全国，确实是用的很少的，已经快要断气了。可是去年一声争鸣齐放，小品文或者杂文也跟着复苏了（当然人民日报经常八版头条有一篇，起了很大的推动作用）。过去，这一个形式，在鲁迅先生的运用下，变成了对敌人的最有效的投枪和匕首，一转到人民取得政权以后，一下子确有不知该如何着手之感。在根据地，有几个人曾经利用这种形式来写过文章，但不是对共产党的恶毒的诬蔑（在延安），便是用来作为反苏反共的武器（在东北）（当然，并不是这种形式注定非如此不可，而是这几个别有企图的人刚好选中了这种形式）。这些比较特别的例子，又使得一些作家不愿轻易尝试这种形式，而在很多读者中也多少造成了这样一种印象：一听到杂文二字，就担心是不是思想意识不好的人又在乱发牢骚了。所以，十几二十年这个形式没有得到充分的利用。正因为如此，就没有能够在这方面磨炼出几支笔来，以致在去年杂文复兴以后，力量单薄。如果要说“危机”，我看危机主要在这里：拿不出很多好的货色来。去年以来，报纸、刊物，那一个不相当重视小品文、杂文、随笔或者什么几  日谈之类，而且有些对于实际工作的评论也采用这个形式了。所以，我以为回春同志对小品文所处的总的形势的估计，是值得再商量的。
    其次，回春同志提出了一个“根本矛盾”问题，我觉得确有把这个问题弄清楚的必要。提出这个问题，对大家很有帮助。回春同志转述一部分人的理由说，小品文“是不民主的时代的产物。现在已经是社会主义民主的时代了；那么，这类小品文是否还有存在的理由呢？这是根本性的问题。”这个理论曾经有人发过，但从来也没有成为一种正式的理论，党的思想工作和文艺工作的领导者们也从来没有发表过这种意见。在延安，曾经有个别的人提出过“现在还是杂文时代”的口号，遭到了比较普遍的反驳。但是谁也看得出，反驳这句口号，不等于宣传人民政权下或者社会主义时代就不容许小品文存在了的理论。回春同志当然是不赞成这种理论的，我也是不赞成这种理论的，在这点上，我们是一致的。但是，回文似乎肯定在客观上目前的根本矛盾是这种理论在作怪，这点，我认为大可商量。事实上，这种理论倒是已经逐渐“自行消亡”了，而不是小品文或杂文“自行消亡”了。事实胜于议论，近一年来，全国报刊上发表的这类文章，何止万篇（因为一个报纸就发表了上百篇或几百篇），杂文要说没有言论自由，是说不过去的。但是有没有人为文说过，现在的时代不许杂文存在呢，我看是没有的。至于有这种理论的人，也仅是一种怀疑，并没有听说过什么人坚持过这种理论的。
    这种理论之为不正确，简直无须驳斥。因为，如果说小品文是讽刺性的多、批评性的多，就不应该存在，那么，整个的讽刺文学怎么办呢？漫画怎么办呢？逻辑的结论必然是通通都要取消，最后一切文学形式都要取消。因为小说、戏剧、电影，更不用说相声之类的文学艺术形式，在在都是离不开批评与讽刺的。所以这个理论简直开口不得，一开口就是自讨苦吃，准定倒霉。另外，还有事实的反驳，高尔基不是在社会主义时代大写其杂文么？不过他的杂文长一些，又被人称作政论罢了，其实是一回事。另一个事实就是一年来的实践，小品文、杂文基本上是受广大读者（包括绝大多数负责干部在内）的欢迎的。所以，时代的矛盾这个问题，我以为并不存在，这个理论也没有什么力量。回春同志提出这个问题，目的显然在有意引起争论，它使我们有一次机会来驳斥这种不正确的、片面的看法，我们是应该感谢他的。
    再次，回春同志还举出写作小品文或者杂文的其余六个矛盾，或者六点困难，对这个问题，我以为应作两方面的观察。一方面是，这些情形确实在不同的情况下、不同的作者的身上遇到过，确实产生了写作杂文上的很多困难。对于这点，我们还要批评，还要奋斗。这种片面的求全责备，在有些作思想、宣传、文艺等领导工作的同志中，确实存在的，因为他们本身有保守主义、教条主义与个人得失问题的存在，他们对新鲜事物视若无睹，他们想光凭老资格、上级信任、“左”比右好等等来维持威信与局面，在这种情形下，一个比较尖锐地提出问题来的人，总是会遇到一些阻碍的。回春同志集中地提出了这些问题，也就集中地批评了那些在这个问题上只是片面地看问题的同志，所以，我觉得在这点上有积极的意义。另一方面，我觉得这又有些把问题夸大了，一来遇到这些阻碍的只是个别文章的个别方面，二来一年来的小品文事实上并没有遇到这么多阻碍，现在发表出来的小品文与杂文为什么还是有那么多尖锐的“投枪”和“匕首”呢？这就说明它们终于冲破了困难而走上了战斗的岗位。此外，这几点还有另一种积极意义，就是告诉了小品文或者杂文的作者，要他们多考虑一下避免片面性的毛病。杂文如果可以提倡片面性，杂文就只有死路一条。不但反对片面性的人反对它，就是那些提倡片面性的人也会反对它。如果不信，你就实践一下提倡片面性的人的理论，试写一篇对提倡片面性的人来一个片面性的批评文章看看，如果他们不发火，那才奇怪。
    最后，我想附带说一说，小品文或者杂文的作者，应该要有一种自我批评的精神，应该要有一种承认自己也可能犯错误的精神，要有容人的雅量，不要总觉得是环境不如意，言论不自由，或者“大干部”在作怪。他们应该考虑，你既然可以在报刊上大写其小品文，人家为什么不可以在下面议论议论你的文章，如果说，议论一下就影响你的写作情绪了，就是横遭阻碍了，那未免又太娇气了。杂文作者是第一个主张大胆批评的人，那么也就要允许人家也可以对你大胆批评。如果对方批评的很不对，你还可在报刊上再发议论。所以根本的问题，还是你看的问题准不准确，对我们这个社会有没有好处。
    我的结论是，障碍是有的，要和那种不正确的干涉斗争。但是客观的障碍，目前远没有构成使小品文消亡的危险，毋宁说，目前正是小品文发展的好环境，只要作者好自为之，不作“小摆设”，不作“无病呻吟”，不要片面的“愤世疾俗”，不要随便骂人，那么广大读者是会保护你的。我们应该、也有可能把小品文或者杂文写得人人都爱看，连那些本来讨厌它们的人慢慢的也爱看起来；这样，小品文是可以不发生危机的，至于若干篇小品文将来仍然可能会发生错误，那是必然的，但这并不是整个小品文的危机。
