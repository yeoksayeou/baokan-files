Was there a "giant" in ancient China?

In 1935, the Dutch paleontologist G.H.R. von Koenigswald discovered a huge tooth in a pile of dragon bones and dragon teeth in a Chinese pharmacy. He believed that this was a huge "ape" produced in China that lived hundreds of thousands of years ago. He also gave it a Latin scientific name - "Gigantopithecus."

In 1945 and 1946, von Koenigswald discovered two more similar teeth. The American paleoanthropologist Franz Weidenreich studied them and believed that Gigantopithecus belonged to the category of humans. Therefore, he renamed von Koenigswald's "Gigantopithecus" to "Giant."

In 1952, von Koenigswald, based on eight teeth purchased successively, agreed with Weidenreich's "Giant" theory. Thus, according to von Koenigswald and Weidenreich, a huge ancient human being lived in China hundreds of thousands of years ago.

However, the materials used by von Koenigswald and Weidenreich were of unknown origin and were only scattered individual teeth. Therefore, at least three questions remained unresolved: (1) Where exactly in China did the "Giant" or "Gigantopithecus" come from? (2) In what kind of stratum was it found, and what was its geological age? (3) Was it a "Giant" or a "Gigantopithecus"?

From the end of 1955 to the beginning of 1956, the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences sent a working team to various caves in Guangxi Province to investigate and study the ancient animal fossils commonly known as "dragon bones" and "dragon teeth" in the caves.

The working team first discovered forty-seven teeth of this Gigantopithecus or Giant in the large piles of dragon teeth in the warehouses of Chinese medicinal materials companies in Nanning and Guangzhou. Later, the working team discovered three teeth of this animal in the stratum of a cave in Daxin County, Guangxi Province, as well as many animal fossils discovered in the same stratum. This solved the first two of the three problems left over since 1946.

At that time, although we had a lot of materials, they were still only individual scattered teeth. There was still no way to solve the third problem, that is, whether it was a Gigantopithecus or a Giant.

The Discovery of the Gigantopithecus Mandible

From May to September 1956, Qin Xiuhuai, a farmer from Changcao Township, Liucheng County, Guangxi, excavated "rock mud" (soil and rock deposits in caves) from a cave in Mount Lengzhai for use as fertilizer. While excavating the "rock mud," he dug up many animal bone fossils. Someone told him that these animal bone fossils were the "dragon bones" sold in Chinese pharmacies. So, Qin Xiuhuai collected a load of the "dragon bones" he found and carried them to the Luoman Cooperative's purchasing station to sell them. However, according to the State Council's notice of April 2, 1956, on protecting cultural relics in agricultural production and construction, it was forbidden to excavate and purchase "dragon bones," and the Luoman purchasing station no longer purchased them.

At that time, Wei Yaoshe, the director of the Luoman People's Bank business office, was at the purchasing station and saw a mandible in Qin Xiuhuai's pile of "dragon bones." He thought that this mandible might have scientific research value, so he persuaded Qin Xiuhuai to hand it over to the government. With Qin Xiuhuai's consent, Wei Yaoshe personally sent the specimen to the Liuzhou City Cultural Bureau.

This is the mandible of the creature called "Gigantopithecus" or "Giant." Later, the farmer Qin Xiuhuai not only gave all his "dragon bones" to the government, but also mobilized his children to look for the few teeth on the mandible that he had lost during excavation.

Because Wei Yaoshe loved cultural relics and Qin Xiuhuai found the lost teeth, they were both rewarded.

At that time, the Guangxi working team dispatched by the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences was in Nanning. Due to the discovery of this mandible fossil, they organized further excavation work in the cave in Liucheng County. Thanks to the excavation work, we have made a big step forward in the study of "Gigantopithecus" or "Giant." We have learned a lot about this animal.

Gigantopithecus Should Belong to the Category of Apes

The cave where Qin Xiuhuai discovered the Gigantopithecus mandible is on Mount Lengzhai, about ninety meters from the current ground. Mount Lengzhai is an isolated mountain, southeast of Xinshechong Village, about half a kilometer from the village.

The cave has upper and lower openings, and the inside of the cave is narrow and high, about ten meters deep. At the bottom of the cave, there is a layer of hard deposits about two meters thick. The part closest to the bottom contains fossils, and the Gigantopithecus mandible was excavated from this layer of fossil-bearing soil and rock.

The most common animal fossils found in the same layer as Gigantopithecus are deer, pigs, and tapirs, and less common are saber-toothed elephants and rhinoceroses. These many kinds of fossils are common in caves throughout southern China. From the general study of Chinese mammals, they are animals that lived in the geological period called the Middle Pleistocene. "Gigantopithecus" or "Giant" of course also lived in this era. According to scientists' estimates, using our current calculation of 365 days a year, this was about 400,000 to 600,000 years ago. They are mostly broken, and mostly juvenile individuals with deciduous teeth or elderly individuals with severely worn teeth.

The teeth on this mandible, compared with the many teeth we have found before, are of a smaller type, that is, the type considered to belong to females. The surfaces of the teeth are very worn, which is a phenomenon of old age. Therefore, we believe that this mandible belongs to an elderly female.

Judging from the nature of the tooth surface, it is clear that "Gigantopithecus" or "Giant" belongs to the omnivorous type, which is completely different from modern apes that eat fruit.

The mandible is thick and strong, and still retains the basic characteristics of apes. However, the teeth above are arranged in a slightly outwardly curved arc, which is different from the parallel rows of modern apes, and also different from the horseshoe shape of humans.

Judging from the entirety of this mandible and the teeth on it, its basic nature is that of an ape, but it has many human-like characteristics, more human characteristics than any known ape (modern or fossil).

This mandible, which was almost destroyed, has been protected by people who love cultural relics, and has solved an important scientific problem. The question of whether the "Gigantopithecus" or "Giant," which has been debated in the world of science since 1946, can now be resolved. That is to say, the huge primate fossils discovered in the Guangxi caves are apes, not humans. Therefore, we should call it "Gigantopithecus" and no longer call it "Giant."

However, as mentioned earlier, Gigantopithecus has many human-like characteristics. Although it is not human, it is only slightly different from humans.

Gigantopithecus Is Not the Ancestor of Chinese Peking Man

This discovery also helps us solve the following problems.

The first question is: Why are the remains of Gigantopithecus and other animals in such a cave?

From the observation of the surrounding terrain and geology, the terrain in this area has changed very little in hundreds of thousands of years. That is to say, when Gigantopithecus lived, Mount Lengzhai was also an isolated island mountain, and the cave entrance was also on a steep cliff quite high from the ground.

So, how could the fossils of so many animals enter this cave?

Some say that they were washed in by the flowing water from the top of the mountain. However, we did not find any traces of flowing water in the excavation, nor did we see any sediments formed by flowing water.

The animals found in the cave, such as deer, pigs, tapirs, rhinoceroses, and elephants, are all ungulates, and it is impossible for them to climb cliffs and live in deep caves. The only possibility is that "Gigantopithecus" transported these many kinds of animals to this cave. Why did it transport so many animals? Of course, it was for food. That is to say, we can speculate that "Gigantopithecus" was omnivorous. We know that modern apes only eat fruit in the forest, and eating meat means changing its original nature.

This conclusion is completely consistent with the previous statement that it is an omnivorous type based on the nature of the teeth. In addition, the fossil bones we found in the cave are mostly broken, which is also consistent with this statement.

As for why the animals found in the cave are mostly juvenile or elderly individuals, how should this be understood? This is because Gigantopithecus's ability to hunt animals was not strong, and it could not catch strong and healthy adult animals, but could only catch the old, young, and weak as food.

In addition, how did "Gigantopithecus" hunt animals? Until now, we have not found any tools that might have been used by Gigantopithecus, such as wooden sticks and stones. It is possible that Gigantopithecus hunted for food with its bare hands - which is also the reason for its low hunting ability.

The second question is: What is the relationship between "Gigantopithecus" and "Peking Man," that is, the question of the history of human development?

400,000 to 600,000 years ago, in northern China, near Zhoukoudian near Beijing, there lived Chinese Peking Man, or "Peking Man"; at the same time, in Guangxi in southern China, there lived "Gigantopithecus." What is the relationship between the two?

Chinese Peking Man is a representative of the first stage in the process of ancient apes developing into modern humans. He can manufacture and use simple and rough tools. "Man is an animal that uses tools." Chinese Peking Man is a member of the human system.

Since his ancestors, Chinese Peking Man has lived in the relatively harsh environment of the north. In a harsh environment, he began to collect living materials with both hands; in the long-term training of this work, his two hands became flexible; due to the coordinated development of the brain, his intelligence also developed. In this way, he stepped into the category of man.

In contrast, since its ancestors, Gigantopithecus has lived in a good environment with very rich food. Therefore, its body has been specially developed, developing into a huge body. At the same time, because it has abundant living materials, there is no need for two forelimbs to engage in laborious collection, so its two forelimbs have naturally not been properly exercised, so it has not been able to use tools, that is, it has not been able to enter the category of man. The conclusions drawn from the initial observation of the Gigantopithecus mandible are also fully consistent with this statement.

Although Gigantopithecus developed towards human characteristics, such as changing from fruit-eating to omnivorous; however, the body developed particularly large, while the working ability of the two forelimbs failed to develop accordingly. Due to the imbalance of development, its ability to hunt animals, as mentioned above, was relatively low. In this way, it could not get enough to supply the needs of its huge body, and naturally became extinct.

We have not found any descendants of Gigantopithecus in the Guangxi caves in strata later than Gigantopithecus, which also proves that it became extinct.

From the above explanation, we can conclude that Chinese Peking Man and Gigantopithecus are two branches separated from the common ancestor of man and ape. The former developed in a balanced way, and developed through labor, and entered the category of man; the latter developed in an unbalanced way, and became extinct in the process of developing towards man. They are members of different branches of the same era, and can only be distant brothers, and cannot be the ancestors of Chinese Peking Man as Weidenreich guessed.

Postscript: Recently, news has been received that a complete Gigantopithecus mandible (possibly a male youth) and several scattered teeth have been discovered in the excavation in Liucheng, Guangxi. (Attached picture)

    广西巨猿下颚之发现的主要意义
    裴文中
    我国古代有没有“巨人”？
    1935年时，荷兰古生物学家孔尼华，在中国药店的龙骨和龙齿的大堆中，发现了一枚巨大的牙齿。他认为这是一种在中国出产的、生活在几十万年以前的一种巨大的“猿”。他并给它一个拉丁文的学名——“巨猿”。
    到1945和1946年时，孔尼华又发现了两枚同类的牙齿，美国的古人类学家魏敦瑞加以研究，认为巨猿的性质属于人的范畴。于是，他将孔尼华的“巨猿”改称为“巨人”。
    1952年孔尼华更根据先后购得的八个牙齿，同意魏氏“巨人”的说法。这样，按照孔、魏二氏的说法，在几十万年以前，在中国生存着一种巨大的古人。
    然而，孔、魏二氏所根据的材料，来历不明，而且是零星单独的牙齿。因此，至少是有三个问题没有解决：（一）“巨人”也好，“巨猿”也好，究竟出产在中国什么地方？（二）在什么样的地层里发现的，地质年代是什么？（三）究竟是“巨人”还是“巨猿”？
    从1955年年底起到1956年初，中国科学院古脊椎动物研究室派遣了一个工作队，到广西省各地山洞里，调查和研究在山洞里的俗名叫作“龙骨”、“龙齿”的古代动物化石。
    这个工作队首先在南宁和广州的中国药材公司仓库里的大堆的龙齿之中，发现了四十七枚这种巨猿或巨人的牙齿。后来这个工作队又在广西省大新县一个山洞的地层里发现了三枚这种动物的牙齿，以及许多在同一地层里发现的各种动物化石，这就解决了从1946年以来遗留的三个问题里的前两个问题。
    那个时候，我们有的材料虽然很多，但仍都是单独的零星牙齿，对于第三个问题，即是巨猿还是巨人的问题，还是没有方法来解决。
    巨猿下颚骨的发现
    1956年5月至9月间，广西柳城县长曹乡农民覃秀怀，在楞寨山的一个山洞里，挖取“岩泥”（山洞里的土石堆积）用作肥料。在挖取“岩泥”时，他挖到了许多动物骨胳化石。有人告诉他，这许多动物骨胳化石就是中药店里的“龙骨”。于是，覃秀怀就将他所发现的“龙骨”收拾了一担，挑到洛满合作社的收购站去售卖。但是，根据1956年4月2日国务院关于在农业生产建设中保护文物的通知，禁止挖掘和收购“龙骨”，洛满收购站已经不收购了。
    当时，洛满人民银行营业所主任韦耀社正在收购站，看见覃秀怀的“龙骨”堆中有一个下颚骨。他就想到这个下颚骨可能有科学研究的价值，于是动员覃秀怀将它交给政府。得到了覃秀怀的同意，韦耀社就亲身将这个标本送到柳州市文化局。
    这就是这个叫“巨猿”又叫“巨人”的下颚骨。后来，农民覃秀怀不仅把他所有的“龙骨”都一齐送给政府，并且动员他的孩子们到田地里寻找在他挖掘时遗失的下颚骨上的几个牙齿。
    由于韦耀社爱护文物，覃秀怀将失而复得的牙齿找回来，他们都分别得到了奖励。
    当时，中国科学院古脊椎动物研究室派遣的广西工作队正在南宁。由于这个下颚骨化石的发现，他们就组织了在柳城县这个山洞里的进一步的发掘工作。由于发掘工作，我们对“巨猿”或“巨人”的研究，向前推进了一大步。我们知道了许多关于这种动物的问题。
    巨猿应该属于猿的范畴
    覃秀怀发现巨猿下颚的洞，在楞寨山上，距现在的地面约有九十公尺。楞寨山是一个孤立的山，在新社冲村的东南方，距村约有半公里远。
    这个洞有上下两个洞口，洞里边窄而高，约有十公尺深。洞底上有一层约两公尺厚的坚硬的堆积。靠近最下的部分，含有化石，巨猿的下颚就是从这一层有化石的土石中挖出来的。
    同巨猿同层发现的动物化石，最多的是鹿、猪和貘，比较少的是剑齿象和犀牛。这许多种化石，都是在中国长江以南各地山洞里常见的种类。从中国哺乳动物总的研究来看，它们是地质上所谓更新世中期生存的动物，“巨猿”或者“巨人”当然也是这个时代生存的了。若按现在我们以三百六十五日为一年的年计算，据科学家估计，约在四十至六十万年以前。它们多半是破碎的，而且多半是幼年有乳齿的或者是老年牙齿磨蚀很深的个体。
    这个下颚骨上的牙齿，若同我们从前发现的许多牙齿比较，是小的一种类型，也就是被认为属于雌性的类型。牙齿的齿面，都磨蚀得很深，是老年的现象。因此，我们认为这个下颚骨是属于一个老年雌性的。
    从牙齿齿面的性质上看，显然“巨猿”或“巨人”是属于杂食的类型，同现代猿类果食者完全不同。
    下颚骨粗壮厚大，还保留着猿的基本性质。但是上面的牙齿排列成稍微向外弯曲的弧形，同现代猿排列成两列平行的行列者不同，也同人类排列成马蹄形者不同。
    从这个下颚骨和它上边牙齿的正体看来，它的基本性质是猿，但是有许多像人的性质，比现在已知的猿（现代的或化石的）都有更多的人的性质。
    这个险些被破坏的下颚骨，得到了爱护文物的人们的保护，在科学上解决了一个重要问题。从1946年以来，世界科学上争论的“巨猿”还是“巨人”的问题可以得到了解决。这就是说，在广西山洞里发现的巨大的灵长类的化石是猿，而不是人。因之，我们应当叫它为“巨猿”，而不应当再叫“巨人”了。
    不过，前边已经说过，巨猿有许多像人的性质。虽然它不是人，但是它同人相差得也是微乎其微的。
    巨猿不是中国猿人的祖先
    这个发现还帮助我们解决了下列一些问题。
    第一个问题是：为什么巨猿和其他动物的遗骨都在这样一个洞里呢？
    从附近的地形地质的观察，这一带的地形几十万年以来，变化很少。这就是说，当巨猿生活的时候，这个楞寨山也是孤立的岛山，洞口也是在距地面相当高的壁立的山崖上。
    那么，这许多动物的化石，又怎能进入这个山洞里去呢？
    有人说，它们是被山顶上的流水冲入的。但是我们在发掘中，没有发现流水冲流的痕迹，也没有看到有流水生成的堆积物。
    在洞里所发现的动物，如鹿、猪、貘、犀牛和象，都是有蹄类的动物，不可能爬上悬崖绝壁生活在深洞里。唯一的可能是“巨猿”将这许多种动物运到这个洞里。为什么它要运这许多动物呢？当然是为了吃。这就是说，我们可以推测“巨猿”是杂食的。我们知道，现代的猿类只吃森林里的果子的果食，吃肉食就是改变了它原来的性质。
    这个推论，同前边所说由牙齿的性质上看它是杂食的类型的说法，是完全符合的。另外，我们从洞里所发现的化石骨胳多半是破碎的，也符合这种说法。
    至于由洞里发现的动物，多半是幼年或老年的个体，这又当如何理解呢？这是因为巨猿猎获动物的能力不强，不能捉住青壮年的强健动物，而只能捕到老幼衰弱者作食物。
    此外，“巨猿”如何猎得动物呢？一直到现在，我们并没有发现可能是巨猿所用的工具，如木棒和石块等。可能巨猿是赤手空拳地去猎取食物的，——这也是它猎物的能力低下的原因。
    第二个问题是：“巨猿”同“北京人”有什么关系，也就是巨猿同人类发展历史的问题。
    四十至六十万年以前，在中国北部，北京附近周口店地方，有中国猿人或叫“北京人”生活着；同一时代里，在中国南方广西地方有“巨猿”生存着。它们两者有什么关系？
    中国猿人是从古猿发展成现代人过程里的第一个阶段的代表者，他能够制造和使用简单粗糙的工具。“人是使用工具的动物”，中国猿人是人类系统内的一个成员。
    中国猿人从他的祖先以来，就生活在北方比较艰苦的环境里。在艰苦的环境里，开始用两只手采集生活资料；在这种工作的长期的锻炼中，将两只手锻炼得灵活了；由于脑筋的配合发展，聪明智力也发展了。这样，他就踏入了人的范畴。
    同此相反，巨猿从它的祖先以来，就生活在食物非常丰富的良好环境里，因此，它的身体得到了特殊的发展，发展成了庞大的身躯。同时，因为有丰富的生活资料，不需要两个前肢从事于勤劳的采集，它的两个前肢自然没有得到应有的锻炼，所以它就一直不能使用工具，也就是没有能够进入人的范畴。从对巨猿下颚骨的初步观察所得到的结论，也完全符合于这种说法。
    巨猿虽然向人的性质方面发展了，如由果食改变为杂食；但是身体发达得特别大，而两个前肢的工作能力却没有能够相应地发展。由于发展的不平衡，它的猎获动物的能力，如前所述，也就比较低下。这样，它就不能得到供给庞大身体的需要，自然就绝灭了。
    我们在广西山洞里，在比巨猿较晚的地层，没有发现巨猿的子孙，也证明它是绝灭了。
    从上述的解释，我们可以得出结论：中国猿人和巨猿是从人和猿的共同祖先分出的两个支派。前者发展得平衡，由于劳动，得到了发展，进入了人的范畴；后者发展不平衡，在向人发展的过程中绝灭了。他们是同时代的不同支派的成员，只能是远方的兄弟，而不可能是像魏敦瑞所猜想的那样认为巨猿是中国猿人的祖先。
    附记：最近得到消息，在广西柳城的发掘中，又发现了一个巨猿的完整的下颚骨（可能是雄性青年者）和几个零星的牙齿。（附图片）
