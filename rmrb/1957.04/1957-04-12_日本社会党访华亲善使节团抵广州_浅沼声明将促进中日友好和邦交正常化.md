Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 11th Dispatch: The Japanese Socialist Party Goodwill Mission, led by Secretary-General of the Japanese Socialist Party Inejiro Asanuma, left Tokyo by plane this morning to come to China.

The Socialist Party mission, at the invitation of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, will pay a ten-day friendly visit to China. During their stay in China, the mission will exchange views with the Chinese side on strengthening friendly relations between Japan and China.

Inejiro Asanuma issued a statement at Haneda Airport before leaving Tokyo.

In the statement, Asanuma said that the Japanese Socialist Party Goodwill Mission would convey the sincere friendship of the Japanese people to the Chinese leaders, headed by Chairman Mao Zedong, and the 600 million Chinese people, and endeavor to promote friendship and good neighborliness between the two countries and the normalization of diplomatic relations.

The statement said that twelve years have passed since the end of the war, and Japan and China have not yet ended the state of war. Such an unfortunate relationship still exists between the two countries, which are neighbors in the Asian region and have close ties in economy, culture, and history. This is intolerable to the Japanese people, who deeply bear the responsibility for the war and are determined to seek their own prosperity in an environment of peace and Asian prosperity. Restoring Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations is the unanimous desire of the 90 million Japanese people.

The statement expressed the hope that the people of Japan would redetermine to promote friendship between Japan and China and the normalization of diplomatic relations. The statement said that the Japanese Socialist Party Goodwill Mission is prepared to take action within the limits of what is possible for an opposition party without diplomatic rights.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 11th Dispatch: The Japanese Socialist Party Goodwill Mission, headed by Inejiro Asanuma, Secretary-General of the Central Executive Committee of the Japanese Socialist Party, a group of ten people, accompanied by Xiao Xiangqian, Deputy Secretary-General of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, arrived in Guangzhou from Shenzhen tonight.

Du Guoxiang, a director of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs in Guangzhou, and others greeted them at the station.
