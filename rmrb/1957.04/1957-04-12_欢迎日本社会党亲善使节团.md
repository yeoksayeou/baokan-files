　　Welcome the Goodwill Delegation of the Japanese Socialist Party
　　By Our Staff Commentator

　　The Goodwill Delegation of the Japanese Socialist Party, headed by the Secretary-General of the Japanese Socialist Party, Inejiro Asanuma, is scheduled to arrive in Beijing today. We sincerely welcome the arrival of these friends.

　　In recent years, exchanges and contacts between the peoples of China and Japan have become increasingly frequent, and the friendship between the two peoples has also been strengthened. In this regard, the Japanese Socialist Party, like many other Japanese friends who are keen to promote Sino-Japanese friendship, has made contributions. Many gentlemen from the Japanese Socialist Party, such as Mozaburo Suzuki, Genjiro Sugiyama, and Jiichiro Matsumoto, have visited China successively. The arrival of the Goodwill Delegation of the Japanese Socialist Party to China marks a further development of the friendly relations between the peoples of China and Japan. This is a cause for rejoicing.

　　The Japanese Socialist Party is the largest opposition party in Japan, and it has a significant influence in the current Japanese political life. At the Japanese Socialist Party Congress in January this year, the Japanese Socialist Party put forward the policy of struggling for a stable life, defending democracy, and peaceful independence, opposing the revision of the constitution, opposing participation in military blocs and arms expansion and war preparation, advocating the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, demanding the revision and abolition of unequal treaties such as the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, and advocating the establishment of a collective security system in Asia and the Pacific region. This proposition of the Japanese Socialist Party is in line with the demands and aspirations of the Japanese people. As Japan's neighbor, we sincerely hope that the Japanese people's struggle for independence and the safeguarding of peace will be victorious at an early date. Japan is one of the important countries in Asia. It is not right for such a country with a long tradition of independence to be in the current humiliating state of being unable to act independently for a long time. An independent, democratic, and peace-loving Japan will undoubtedly play a major role in the peace of Asia and the world.

　　The Japanese Socialist Party advocates that Japan should quickly restore diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, and opposes the "two Chinas" theory, advocating "not recognizing two Chinas." This attitude of the Japanese Socialist Party on the so-called "two Chinas" issue is correct, and it reflects the opinions of the broad masses of the Japanese people. Those who create the so-called "two Chinas" argument are not only attempting to invade China's territory of Taiwan and split China, but also attempting to maintain a source of tension in Asia. All those who are willing to work for peace in the Asian region cannot but oppose this argument. Some people in Japan, while claiming that they are willing to normalize Sino-Japanese relations, are following others in advocating the "two Chinas" argument. In fact, any "two Chinas" idea can only hinder the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations. The imperialists hope to use the "two Chinas" argument to prevent the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. Because they know very well that the restoration of normal relations between China and Japan, such two countries, will have a profound impact on the peace and stability of Asia, especially the Far East.

　　We wish the gentlemen of the Goodwill Delegation of the Japanese Socialist Party a pleasant visit to China, and we believe that through the increasing contacts and visits between the peoples and people from all walks of life in China and Japan, Sino-Japanese relations will increasingly develop in the direction of normalization.

    欢迎日本社会党亲善使节团
    本报评论员
    以日本社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎为首的日本社会党访华亲善使节团，定于今日到达北京，我们衷心欢迎这些朋友们的到来。
    近几年来，中日两国人民之间的往来和接触日益频繁，两国人民之间的友谊也日益加强。在这方面，日本社会党和其他许多日本热心于促进中日友好的朋友们一样，是有贡献的。日本社会党的铃木茂三郎、杉山元治郎、松本治一郎等许多位先生都曾经先后访问过中国。这次日本社会党访华亲善使节团的到来，标志着中日两国人民之间友好关系的进一步发展。这是值得高兴的事情。
    日本社会党是日本最大的一个在野党，它在当前日本政治生活中有着显著的影响。在今年1月日本社会党代表大会上，日本社会党提出了为安定生活、保卫民主、和平独立而斗争的方针，反对修改宪法，反对参加军事集团和扩军备战，主张禁止原子武器和氢武器，要求修改和废除美日安全条约等不平等条约、恢复中日邦交，并且主张在亚洲和太平洋地区建立集体安全体系。日本社会党的这种主张，是符合于日本人民的要求和愿望的。作为日本的邻国，我们衷心希望日本人民争取独立、维护和平的斗争能够早日得到胜利。日本是亚洲的重要国家之一。这样一个有着悠久的独立传统的国家，长期处于目前的不能自主的屈辱状态，是不应该的。一个独立的、民主的、爱好和平的日本，无疑将对亚洲和世界的和平起重大的作用。
    日本社会党主张日本迅速和中华人民共和国恢复邦交，并且反对“两个中国”的说法，主张“不承认有两个中国”。日本社会党在所谓“两个中国”问题上的这种态度，是正确的，它是反映了日本广大人民的意见的。那些制造所谓“两个中国”的论调的人，其目的不仅是企图侵占中国的领土台湾，分裂中国，而且是企图在亚洲保持一个制造紧张局势的根源。一切愿意为亚洲地区的和平而努力的人，都不能不反对这种论调。日本国内有些人，一面宣称愿意使中日关系正常化，一面却跟着别人鼓吹“两个中国”的论调。而实际上，任何“两个中国”的想法，都只能妨碍中日关系正常化。帝国主义者们就是希望用“两个中国”的论调来阻挡中日邦交的恢复。因为它们知道得很清楚，中国和日本这样两个国家的正常关系的恢复，对于亚洲特别是远东地区的和平和稳定将发生深远的影响。
    我们祝日本社会党访华亲善使节团的诸位先生们在中国的访问愉快，并且相信，通过中日两国人民和各界人士之间越来越多的接触和访问，中日关系将日益向正常化的方向发展。
