    A Brief Discussion on Cultural Heritage
    Chen Xianghe
      Some time ago, I received a letter from a comrade working in archaeology, containing a few sentences which I transcribe below: "Not long ago, I traveled to the South for two months and felt even more strongly that scholars who annotate the *Book of Songs*, *Yuefu Poetry*, *Among the Flowers*, and the novel *Dream of the Red Chamber* would find it difficult to do without studying cultural relics. There are so many unearthed objects... On the other hand, the annotators are still stuck with the old methods. It seems that there is a gap in this department's advance towards science, and it needs to be filled..." According to this letter, the intention was to have me reflect this to the relevant leadership. But I didn't do it that way. The reason is that for the development of any work, especially academic research, it is difficult to be effective to rashly make suggestions when everyone's views are not yet consistent; I have encountered such experiences far too many times. At most, the listener will just perfunctorily say, "Very right, I deeply agree." But what happens after feeling it? It's still dismissed with a smile!
    This involves the issue of everyone's views on cultural heritage.
    For example, some people only keep cultural heritage in books, believing that only what is written down in black and white counts as scholarship. Of course, everyone knows the principles of "labor creates the world" and "the people create history." However, when it comes to cultural and artistic heritage, even the rich and colorful music and dance and stage performing arts of our ancient China, mostly preserved in the countless existing opera genres and folk art performances—the tunes and singing methods of the Song Dynasty *ci* poetry were only excavated from the folk music of the Northwest last year—such facts are forgotten. And it just so happens that these living heritages are all, or at least for the most part, created by the working people of all generations.
    In addition, there are the unearthed cultural relics mentioned by the comrade above. Whether these objects were for the use of the nobility or the common people, they all came from the hands of the working people of all generations and can reflect the real life and struggles of the time, which is beyond doubt. It is a pity that in every exhibition of unearthed cultural relics, I rarely meet our colleagues. On the contrary, I often see groups of international friends diligently making observations, inquiries, and records. Therefore, almost every time, I cannot help but be startled by the problem of connecting theory with practice in our research work.
    From my personal point of view, almost every visit to an exhibition of unearthed cultural relics is very enlightening and educational for me. For example, at the Chu cultural relics exhibition, when I saw the brightly colored lacquerware, the exquisite bamboo mats, and the crossbows that the Chu people used to shoot birds thousands of years ago with nearly mechanized methods, as well as iron swords, glass beads, etc., I could not help but see from these objects the brilliant achievements of the Chu culture at that time. At the same time, I also realized that some of the immortal works of our great poet Qu Yuan, with their descriptions of splendor and magnificence, were not entirely due to his personal genius and imagination, but indeed had a material basis in the reality of social life. For example, in the Five Provinces Unearthed Cultural Relics Exhibition, I saw the actual objects of the "brocade and embroidered satin presented to me by a beauty, how can I repay her but with a green jade tray?" mentioned in Zhang Heng's "Four Sorrows Poems" of the Han Dynasty, and the kind of "tray" used when Meng Guang served Liang Hong food "raising the tray to eyebrow level". It turned out that this was a wooden utensil, no more than a foot wide and two feet long, with short legs on both ends like a modern tea tray, not as large as the desks we use today. Naturally, we don't need to worry about Meng Guang's slender hands being unable to bear the weight when lifting it up. In the same exhibition, I also saw several sets of Tang Dynasty musician figurines. From these sets of objects, we can see that the seven-stringed zither of the Tang Dynasty was played in harmony with the *sheng* and *xiao*, and the singers all covered their left ears with their hands, which can be imagined as the grand sound when they sang at the top of their lungs. In addition, there are many, many examples related to understanding the real life, history, culture, and art of ancient China, which are truly beautiful and too numerous to list.
    From the above facts, it can be seen that if we only use the method of "not hearing what happens outside the window, focusing only on reading the books of sages," not seeing people, not seeing society—including the unearthed cultural relics that can see ancient social life—to do research work, it is really not a good method, at least as the comrade who wrote the letter said, it is a "gap," especially in the departments of history, literature, and art.

    略谈文化遗产
    陈翔鹤
      日前曾接到一位作考古工作同
  志的一封信，内中有几句话，抄录
  如下：“不久以前，到南方走了两个月，更加深一层感觉，觉得由诗经到乐府诗、花间词、红楼梦小说，作注的学者先生，不学学文物怕很不好办。出土的东西太多了，……另一方面作注的还依旧停留在老方法上，这部门向科学进军似有个缺口，得填补才行。……”据这封来信的意思是要叫我去向有关领导方面反映反映。但我没有这样办。原因是对每一项工作的发展，特别是学术研究工作，在大家看法尚不一致的时候便去贸然进言，是很难得有效果的；这样的经验我所遇见的，已经不算太少了。至多在听者亦不过敷衍一句“很对，深有同感。”如此而已。但感了以后又怎样呢？还不是一笑置之！
    这就牵连到各人对于文化遗产的看法问题了。
    比如有的人就只将文化遗产停留在书本上面，认为用白纸黑字写下来才算学问。当然，“劳动创造世界”，“人民创造历史”，这些道理是谁都知道的。然而当一谈文化艺术遗产，就连我国古代丰富多采的乐与舞以及舞台表演艺术，多保存在现存的数不清的剧种和民间曲艺演唱内——宋词的曲调及唱法也还是去年才从西北的民间发掘出来的，——这样的事实也都会被忘记了。而恰巧这些活的遗产又全都或至少绝大部分为历代劳动人民之所创造。
    此外，便要算上面那位同志所提到过的出土文物了。这些实物不管是为贵族用的或平民用的，而其全都出于历代劳动人民之手，可以反映当时的真实生活和斗争，更是毫无疑义。可惜得很，在每次出土文物展览会中，我都很少遇见我们的同行。而相反地，倒是时常看见有三三两两的国际友人在那里勤勤恳恳地做着观察、问询和记录。因此，几乎每次都不能不使我怵目惊心地想到我们研究工作中的联系实际问题。
    从我个人讲，几乎每一次去参观出土文物展览，对我的启发和教育意义都是很大的。比如楚文物展览罢，当我一看见楚民族的色彩鲜艳的漆器、精工细致的篾席，以及几千年前楚人民就用近于机械化的弩机来射鸟，此外还有铁剑、琉璃珠子等等，这些都不能不令人从实物中得见当时楚文化的光辉灿烂的成就，而同时也体会到我国的伟大诗人屈原的一些不朽之作，其描写的辉煌绚灿，并非完全出于他个人的天才幻想，而实在是有其现实社会生活的物质基础的。又比如，在五省出土文物展览中，我曾得见过在汉代张衡“四愁诗”中说到过的“美人赠我锦绣缎，何以报之青玉案，”以及孟光向梁鸿进食时的“举案齐眉”的那种所谓“案”的实物。原来这是一种木制的，宽不过一尺，长不过二尺，两头带有矮脚如现代茶盘般的用具，并非如现今书案般的大，自然我们也更用不着去因为举起来重甸甸的而替孟光女士的纤纤玉手力不胜任而耽心了。在同一展览会中，我还得见过若干套唐代乐伎的土俑，从这一套套的实物中我们可以看出唐代的七弦琴是用笙、箫来合奏的，而歌者们又全都用手来掩着左耳，这可以想像其引吭高歌时发音的宏大。此外还有许许多多与理解我国古代现实生活和历史、文化艺术有关的例子，实在是美不胜收，难以一一列举了。
    从上面的一些事实看来，可见我们此刻如果只用“两耳不闻窗外事，一心专读圣贤书”，看不见人，看不见社会——包括可以看见古代社会生活的出土文物——的方法来作研究工作，那实在不是一个良好办法，至少正如前面那位写信同志所说的算是一个“缺口”，而特别是在历史、文学艺术部门。
