Xinhua News Agency Report: The academic committee of the Third Institute of History Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the preparatory committee for the Academic Conference on Modern and Contemporary Chinese History held a joint meeting on the 18th to discuss the preparations for the Academic Conference on Modern and Contemporary Chinese History. The academic conference is scheduled to be held in August this year.

The meeting noted that the study of modern and contemporary Chinese history in our country has been weak in recent years. Systematic research is lacking in the fields of economic history, political history, and cultural history. Comprehensive research is even scarcer. In terms of research methods, there are still strong ingrained views, and some researchers lack the spirit of in-depth study and seeking truth from facts. The importance of archival work has not yet been recognized by all researchers. The meeting believes that the academic conference to be held in August will address the above situation and discuss the future research direction of modern and contemporary Chinese history. Several major issues debated in historical circles in recent years, such as the periodization of modern history, the nature of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolution, and the evaluation of modern historical figures (including Zeng Guofan and Li Hongzhang), will also be discussed at the academic conference.

The joint meeting also decided to step up the organization of the academic conference and the solicitation of papers. In the five months since the preparation work began, more than 40 papers have been received from historians across the country.

More than 30 people attended the preparatory meeting, including Pan Zinian, Fan Wenlan, Hou Wailu, Hu Sheng, and Yan Zhongping.

    史学界积极准备开展争鸣
    将召开中国近代、现代史学术会议
    新华社讯　中国科学院历史研究所第三所学术委员和中国近代、现代史学术会议筹备委员在18日举行联席会议，讨论了中国近代、现代史学术会议的准备工作。这个学术会议预定在今年8月召开。
    会议认为我国近年来对近代、现代史的研究还很薄弱，无论经济史、政治史、文化史等领域都缺少系统的研究，全面的综合研究则更少。在研究方法上还有着浓厚的因袭观点，有些研究者缺少深入钻研和实事求是的精神。资料工作迄今没有引起所有研究者的重视。会议认为今年8月间将召开的学术会议，就是要针对上述情况，讨论今后近代、现代史的研究方向。对近年来在史学界所争论的几个主要问题，如近代史分期问题，太平天国革命的性质问题，以及近代史人物（包括曾国藩、李鸿章）的评价等，也都将在学术会议上进行讨论。
    联席会议并决定要加紧对这次学术会议的组织工作及论文征集工作。自筹备工作进行以来的五个月中，已收到全国各地史学工作者的论文四十多篇。
    出席这次筹备会议的有潘梓年、范文澜、侯外庐、胡绳、严中平等三十多人。
