    Fuping Folk Songs
    Collected by Yuan Tongxing
    In 1931, the 24th Army of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army once liberated Fuping, Hebei, and established a Soviet regime. The Red Army stayed in Fuping for two months before being forced to withdraw. The local people composed many folk songs to express their welcome to the Red Army, celebrate their liberation, and express extreme hatred for the reactionary rule. The "Green Army" mentioned refers to the troops of the reactionary warlord Shi Yousan, because they wore green uniforms.

    Waiting for the Iron Tree to Bloom Red Flowers
    The Red Army is here, laughing happily,
    We've been given land and returned to our old homes;
    We've been waiting a thousand years, ten thousand years for this,
    Waiting for the iron tree to bloom red flowers!

    The Red Army is our Great Benefactor
    The sun rises over the mountains, filling the sky with red,
    The Red Army is our great benefactor;
    Opening the landlords' granaries to help us poor people,
    Our hard work belongs to us—
    One斗 for adults, five升 for children!

    When Will You Come Back Again?
    The Red Army is leaving,
    The farmers are crying sadly;
    Holding the Red Army's hands,
    When will you come back again?

    The Red Army is Gone, the Green Army is Here
    The Red Army is gone, the Green Army is here,
    With three knives tucked in their bosoms—
    The first knife is for robbery;
    The second knife is for silver dollars;
    The third knife is for girls!

    Revolutionary Flowers Bloom Next Year
    The mountain peony flowers bloom red and bright,
    Heroes come to the Taihang Mountains;
    Scattering revolutionary seeds everywhere,
    Revolutionary flowers will bloom next year!

    阜平民谣
    袁同兴搜集
    1931年，中国工农红军二十四军，曾一度解放河北阜平，建立苏维埃政权。红军在阜平居留有两个月，后被迫撤出。当地人民编了许多歌谣，来表示对红军的欢迎，歌颂自己的解放；并对反动统治表示了极端的仇恨。其中提到的“绿军”，是指石友三反动军阀的部队，因他们穿绿军服。
    盼到铁树开红花红军来喽笑哈哈，分得土地回老家；千年万载这一盼，盼到铁树开红花！
    红军是咱大恩人日头出山满天红，红军是咱大恩人；打开地主仓，救济咱穷人，咱们的辛苦归咱们——大人一斗，小孩五升！
    啥时再回来红军要离开，农人哭的哀；拉住红军手，啥时再回来？
    红军走了绿军到红军走了绿军到，怀里搋着三把刀——头把刀子要抢劫；二把刀子要银洋；三把刀子要姑娘！
    革命花开待来年山丹花开红艳艳，英雄来到太行山；遍地撒下革命籽，革命花开待来年！
