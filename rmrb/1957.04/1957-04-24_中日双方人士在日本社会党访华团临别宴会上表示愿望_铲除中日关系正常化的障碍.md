Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd – As the Japanese Socialist Party Goodwill Mission to China prepares to leave Beijing and return home, they held a farewell banquet tonight.

    The head of the mission, Asanuma Inejirō, gave a farewell speech at the banquet, bidding farewell to people from all walks of life in China. He said that after the mission came to China and exchanged views with Chinese national leaders and people from all walks of life, they felt even more strongly that diplomatic relations between Japan and China should be restored as soon as possible. They will continue to work towards this goal.
    Asanuma Inejirō said that it should be possible to travel directly from Tokyo to Beijing, but instead one has to go through Hong Kong and Guangzhou to get here. This is a man-made waste. From this point of view alone, diplomatic relations should be restored as soon as possible.
    Speaking of his impressions of his visit to China, Asanuma Inejirō said that China is waging a new war, that is, a struggle against nature after defeating feudalism, imperialism, and resolving the problem of class struggle. This was originally an ideal of mankind, but China is moving in this direction. He wished the Chinese people success in the new struggle.
    Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, raised his glass to wish the Japanese guests a smooth journey home. He expressed his admiration for the mission because they were not only working to promote the early normalization of Sino-Japanese relations, but also pointed out that "there is only one China, and the Taiwan issue is an internal affair of China and should be resolved by China itself." This view has played a clarifying role in Japanese politics.
    He said that he had a very pleasant time with the Japanese guests because everyone was largely in agreement and very close on issues such as Sino-Japanese relations and world peace. He said that it was particularly gratifying that he and Asanuma Inejirō issued a joint statement. He expressed his belief that the mission would be successful in implementing the points in the joint statement after returning home.
    Peng Zhen, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Mayor of Beijing, on behalf of the Chinese people, thanked the mission for bringing the friendship of the Japanese people and asked the mission to convey the greetings of the Chinese people to the Japanese people.
    Peng Zhen said that the friendly relations between China and Japan should be viewed from a long-term and fundamental perspective. China and Japan have a long tradition of friendship and history and culture, and now have common interests. Both are subjected to the arrogance of U.S. imperialism, both want to safeguard national sovereignty and independence, Far Eastern and world peace, both hope to conduct economic cooperation and cultural exchanges with each other, and both hope that the relations between the two countries will be normalized as soon as possible. This is the common basis for developing our two countries' friendship. However, we have not yet restored diplomatic relations, and our exchanges are still hampered, because there are obstacles set up by U.S. imperialism between us.
    Peng Zhen proposed a toast to eliminating the obstacles to the normalization of relations between China and Japan, and to tearing down the curtain hanging over the heads of the two peoples.
    Also invited to attend the banquet were Li Jishen, Guo Moruo, and Chen Shutong, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; Dong Biwu and Zhang Bojun, Vice Chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; Qiao Guanhua and Luo Longji, Vice Presidents of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs; and well-known figures from all walks of life in China, including Ye Jizhuang, Li Dequan, Wang Zhen, Xu Deheng, Liao Chengzhi, Zhang Su, Wang Kunlun, Lei Renmin, Wang Zigan, Tu Changwang, and Yang Yu.

### 中日双方人士在日本社会党访华团临别宴会上表示愿望  铲除中日关系正常化的障碍

    中日双方人士在日本社会党访华团临别宴会上表示愿望
    铲除中日关系正常化的障碍
    新华社23日讯　行将离开北京回国的日本社会党访华亲善使节团今晚举行临别宴会。
    使节团团长浅沼稻次郎在会上致词，向中国各界人士辞行。他说，使节团来中国后，同中国国家领导人和各界人士交换了意见，使他们更加感到日中两国的邦交应该早日恢复。他们将继续为达到这一目标而努力。
    浅沼稻次郎说，从东京到北京本来可以直接来往，但是却要经过香港、广州才能到此，这是人为制造的浪费。光从这点来看，也应早日恢复邦交。
    浅沼稻次郎谈到访华观感时说，中国正进行一个新的战争，这就是在战胜了封建主义、帝国主义和解决了阶级斗争问题以后，向自然界所进行的斗争。这本来是人类的一种理想，但是中国正朝着这个方向发展。他祝中国人民在新的斗争中获得成功。
    中国人民外交学会会长张奚若举杯祝日本客人归途顺利。他对使节团表示很钦佩，因为他们不仅在为促进中日关系早日正常化而努力，而且他们指出了“中国只有一个，台湾问题是中国内部问题，应由中国自己来解决”。这个看法，在日本政治上起了一种澄清作用。
    他说，他这次同日本客人相处，彼此精神上都很愉快，就是因为大家在中日两国关系和世界和平等问题的看法上都大体一致，都很接近。他说，特别令人愉快的是，他和浅沼稻次郎发表了共同声明。他表示相信，为实现共同声明中各点，使节团回国后一定会获得成功。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长、北京市市长彭真代表中国人民，感谢使节团带来日本人民的友谊，并请使节团向日本人民带回中国人民的致意。
    彭真说，要从长远的根本的利益来看中日两国的友好关系。中日两国有着悠久的友谊传统和历史文化，现在又有着共同的利害关系，都受着美帝国主义的气，都要维护国家的主权和独立、远东和世界和平，都希望同对方进行经济合作和文化交流，都希望两国关系早日正常化，这就是发展我们两国友谊的共同基础。然而，我们之间直到现在还没有恢复邦交，彼此往来还受着阻挠，这就因为在我们之间还有着美帝国主义设下的障碍。
    彭真提议，为铲除中日两国关系正常化中的障碍，为扯掉摆在两国人民头上的幕幛而干杯。
    应邀出席宴会的，还有全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长李济深、郭沫若、陈叔通，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席董必武、章伯钧，中国人民外交学会副会长乔冠华、罗隆基以及中国各界著名人士叶季壮、李德全、王震、许德珩、廖承志、张苏、王昆仑、雷任民、王子纲、涂长望、杨煜等。
