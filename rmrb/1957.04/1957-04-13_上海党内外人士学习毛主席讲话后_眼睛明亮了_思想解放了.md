Shanghai Party Members and Non-Party People Study Chairman Mao's Speech:
　　Eyes Brightened, Minds Liberated
(Our report) Tens of thousands of Party members and non-Party people in Shanghai, after hearing the report conveying Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference, excitedly and earnestly conducted multiple discussions.

Everyone believes that Chairman Mao's report on correctly handling contradictions among the people is of extremely great significance. Many people said that after studying this report, their eyes became brighter and their minds were liberated. In the group discussions of the district committees of the CPC, many Party members criticized the past idea of "after conquering the country, everything will be peaceful." They said that since contradictions are objectively existent, not acknowledging them is deceiving oneself, and work will inevitably encounter setbacks. Cadres of the Municipal Agriculture Bureau said: It is wrong to deal with contradictions among the people with crude methods that are divorced from the masses. In an era of great transformation, work methods and work styles should also be changed. During the discussions, people from various democratic parties believed that this report embodies the spirit of fully promoting democracy, uniting all forces that can be united to serve socialist construction.

The discussions of Shanghai's democratic parties and industrial and commercial circles mostly focused on the issues of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," the Party's united front policy, and the redemption policy. In the discussions, more people than in the past dared to expose their thoughts and make sharp criticisms of the Party's work. During a discussion on the nature of the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie, the industrial and commercial group of the Shanghai Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association, most people believed that class contradictions were originally antagonistic contradictions; however, due to China's specific circumstances, the antagonistic contradictions between the working class and the national bourgeoisie have been transformed into contradictions among the people. Yan Jinxing of the rubber industry said: "We must correctly recognize this transformation of contradictions, and we must not relax our efforts in transformation; otherwise, the decadent bourgeois style will make a comeback."

Intellectuals in Shanghai were extremely active in this discussion. They discussed the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy, the ideological remolding of intellectuals, serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, how the Party leads science, and the arrangements for middle and primary school graduates. They criticized the shortcomings in the current work and also put forward some suggestions on how to solve the problems. For example, regarding the arrangement of middle and primary school graduates, Professors Chen Wangdao and Zhang Jiangshu and others put forward some very good methods.

Those who participated in the discussions freely expressed their opinions on the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy. In a group of the Xincheng District Committee, someone raised the argument that "letting a hundred flowers bloom prospers the arts but sacrifices the masses," which sparked a heated debate. Through the debate, they gained a further understanding of the "letting" policy. They said: At present, the class struggle has basically ended, and the main problem is the internal problems of the people. Therefore, "letting" can prosper artistic creation and produce more, better, and more meaningful works. Cultural figures were excited and encouraged after in-depth discussions of the "letting" policy. Xu Pingyu, Chen Shan, and others all believed that solving problems among the people is much more difficult with persuasive education than with simple and crude methods. Therefore, we must study Marxism-Leninism well and learn from the masses and experts.

During the discussion, everyone felt that Chairman Mao had high hopes and requirements for intellectuals. Therefore, those who educate others should first be educated themselves. Yuan Xiluo said: "To be honest, the knowledge of intellectuals is limited. Since Confucius, intellectuals have been somewhat arrogant and like to be teachers, which is really misleading. There is an old Chinese saying: 'Live and learn, and there is still three-tenths you cannot learn.' To be a teacher, you need to learn more yourself." Many people said that it is necessary for intellectuals to go to the countryside and factories, only in this way can they have common thoughts and feelings and a common language with workers, peasants, and soldiers.

The discussion also reflected that some people still have ideological confusion, concerns, and doubts. Some said that they had written a book of hundreds of thousands of words, but they did not dare to publish it yet, and wanted to see "which way the wind blows." Some said that they did not dare to publish articles under their real names, fearing that they would be "rectified." Some also doubted whether the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy is a long-term policy. These all need to be gradually clarified.

### 上海党内外人士学习毛主席讲话后  眼睛明亮了　思想解放了

    上海党内外人士学习毛主席讲话后
    眼睛明亮了　思想解放了
    本报讯　上海市数以万计的党内外人士，听了毛主席在最高国务会议上讲话的传达报告后，兴奋地、认真地进行了多次的讨论。
    大家都认为毛主席关于正确地处理人民内部矛盾问题的报告，具有极其重大的意义。许多人说，学习了这个报告，眼睛更明亮了，思想也得到了解放。在中共各区委会的小组讨论中，不少党员批判了过去认为“打下江山，太平无事”的思想。他们说，矛盾既是客观存在的，不承认矛盾便是自欺欺人，工作必然会碰钉子。市农业局的干部说：用脱离群众的粗暴的办法处理人民内部矛盾是错误的，处在大转变的时代，工作方法、工作作风也应有所改变。各民主党派人士在讨论时，都认为这一报告贯彻了充分发扬民主、团结一切可以团结的力量为社会主义建设服务的精神。
    上海各民主党派组织和工商界人士的讨论，大都集中在“长期共存、互相监督”、党的统战政策、赎买政策等问题上。在讨论中，已有比过去更多的人敢于暴露思想，并对党的工作提出尖锐的批评。民主建国会上海分会工商小组在讨论到工人阶级和资产阶级矛盾的性质时，大多数人都认为阶级矛盾原来是对抗性的矛盾；但是由于中国的具体情况，工人阶级和民族资产阶级对抗性的矛盾已转化为人民内部的矛盾。橡胶业颜金星说：“我们要正确认识这个矛盾的转化，不要放松改造，否则腐朽的资产阶级作风又会死灰复燃。”
    上海市知识分子在这次讨论中极为活跃，他们讨论了“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，知识分子的思想改造，为工农兵服务，党如何领导科学，以及中小学毕业生的安排等问题。他们对目前工作中的缺点提出了批评，也提出了一些如何解决问题的建议。例如关于中小学毕业生的安排问题，陈望道、张江树教授等人就提出一些很好的办法。
    参加讨论的人，对“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，畅所欲言地发表了自己的意见。新成区委的一个小组就有人提出的“百花齐放，繁荣了艺术，牺牲了群众”的论点，展开热烈的争论，通过争论，对“放”的方针，有了进一步的认识。他们说：目前，阶级斗争已基本结束，主要的问题是人民内部问题了。因此，放，可以繁荣艺术创作，可以产生更多更好更富有意义的作品。文化界人士深入讨论了“放”的方针后，都感到兴奋鼓舞。徐平羽、陈山等都认为，解决人民内部问题，用说服教育的办法比采取简单的粗暴的办法要难得多，因此，要很好地向马克思列宁主义学习，向群众、向专家学习。
    讨论中，大家都感到毛主席对知识分子的希望和要求是很高的，因此，教育别人的人，自己应该先受教育。袁希洛说：“说实在话，知识分子的知识是有限的，自孔子以后，知识分子就有些自高自大，好为人师，实在是误人子弟。中国有句古话：‘做到老，学到老，还有三分学不到。’要做先生自己更需要学习。”许多人都说知识分子下乡下厂是必要的，只有这样，才能和工农兵有共同的思想感情，共同的语言。
    从讨论中也反映出：在一部分人中，也还存在着思想上的混乱、顾虑和怀疑。有人提出他已写了一部数十万字的书，但还不敢出版，要再看看“风头”，有的表示不敢用真姓名发表文章，还怕挨“整”，也有人怀疑“百花齐放、百家争鸣”是否是长期的方针。这些，都有待于逐步地澄清。
