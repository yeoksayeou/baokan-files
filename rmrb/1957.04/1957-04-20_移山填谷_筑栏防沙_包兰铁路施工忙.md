Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Tens of thousands of railway construction workers have entered the mountains and the Tengger Desert in the southern section of the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway, and large-scale construction has begun in the more than 200-kilometer range from Dijiatai to Zhongwei.

　　Traveling north along the railway construction line, one can see vehicles and horse-drawn carts transporting equipment everywhere, and the sound of blasting echoes in the mountains. The first key project continuing north from Dijiatai is the moving mountains and filling valleys project, which requires leveling several mountain tops and filling the valleys with a roadbed as high as a ten-story building, involving a massive amount of earthwork. In addition, several smaller valleys need to be filled.

　　The railway construction enters the Tengger Desert from the southwest of Zhongwei. Here, the railway line, which is more than 100 kilometers long heading north, will cross the desert six times. The wind and sand are very strong here, and when the wind blows, the workers behind cannot see the figures of those working in front. When the wind and sand subside slightly, the laborers immediately drive camel caravans to transport water from afar. The roadbed workers are also divided into two groups: one group uses sand to pile up the roadbed, and the other group quickly presses the roadbed with stones, otherwise, when the wind rises again, the roadbed will be blown away without a trace. Sand barriers and "platforms" will be built on both sides of the roadbed, and in the future, shelterbelts will be built outside the sand barriers to fix the sand. Soon, the scorching heat of 140 degrees Fahrenheit will descend on the vast desert, and the railway construction workers are stepping up preparations, planning to carry out nighttime construction during the most adverse natural conditions.

　　Last year, the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway had already laid 82 kilometers of track from Lanzhou to Dijiatai. From Dijiatai to Zhongwei, a total of more than 300 bridges and culverts need to be built, more than 11 million cubic meters of earth and stone need to be excavated, and six special desert roadbeds need to be constructed. This is the first time that our country has built a railway in such a large desert. (Attached picture)

### 移山填谷　筑栏防沙  包兰铁路施工忙

    移山填谷　筑栏防沙
    包兰铁路施工忙
    据新华社讯　几万名筑路工人进入了包兰铁路南段的丛山和腾格里大沙漠，从狄家台到中卫二百多公里的范围内已经展开大规模的施工。
    沿着铁路施工线北行，随处可以看到运输器材的汽车和马车群，丛山中回响着开山炮的爆破声。从狄家台继续北进的第一个关键工程是移山填谷工程，这里需要削平几个山头，在山谷中填筑起十层楼高的路基，土方数量非常浩大。此外，还要填平好几个较小的山谷。
    筑路工程从中卫西南开始进入腾格里大沙漠，这里向北一百多公里的铁路线共要穿过沙漠六次。这里风砂很大，风砂刮起来，后面的工人看不到前面工作的人影。等到风砂稍停，民工们马上赶着骆驼队到远处去运水。路基工人也分成两部分，一部分人用砂子堆成路基，另一部分赶紧用石块把路基压起来，否则大风再起，路基就会被吹得无影无踪。路基两旁要修筑防砂栏和“平台”，今后还要在防砂栏外营造起固沙林带。不久，华氏一百四十度的酷暑季节将降临到大沙漠上，筑路工人正在加紧准备，计划在自然条件最恶劣的日子里展开夜晚施工。
    包兰铁路去年已经自兰州铺轨八十二公里到狄家台。从狄家台到中卫，共要修筑三百多座桥梁涵洞，开挖一千一百多万方的土石方，另外还要建设六段沙漠特殊路基。我国在这样的大沙漠上修筑铁路，这还是第一次。（附图片）
