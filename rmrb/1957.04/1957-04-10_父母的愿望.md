    My son will graduate from sixth grade this summer. After reading the People's Daily editorial on April 8th, "On the Issue of Primary and Secondary School Graduates Participating in Agricultural Production," I would like to share my views on this matter.

    Children are the successors to our socialist society. As parents, we all care about our children's education, their future, and hope that they will become knowledgeable individuals with noble moral character. This is a common aspiration for every parent.

    To enable our children to become knowledgeable individuals with noble moral character, I believe it's not just about attending school for more years and learning more book knowledge. They should also be tempered through the process of labor, gaining practical production knowledge, cultivating their labor perspective, and enhancing their political awareness.

    In daily family life, parents should cooperate closely with schools. In addition to supervising children's homework, we should also pay attention to their moral education, fostering habits of hard work, plain living, and love of labor. We should encourage them to do what they can, such as washing scarves, handkerchiefs, socks, tidying up their rooms, and sweeping the courtyard. Furthermore, parents can tell their children about the difficulties working people faced in the old society regarding life and education, which will help them correctly approach the issue of further education.

    In the future, a portion of middle and primary school graduates will not be able to continue their education each year. Parents should work with the government and schools to properly educate and place these graduates who cannot continue their studies. This is also an unshirkable responsibility for parents.

    父母的愿望
    赵士贤
    我的一个儿子今年暑期就要从小学六年级毕业了。我读了4月8日人民日报“关于中小学毕业生参加农业生产问题”的社论以后，想谈谈对这个问题的看法。
    孩子，是我们建设社会主义社会的接班人。我们作父母的都关心对自己孩子的教育，关心孩子的前途，希望孩子成为一个有知识和具有高尚道德的人。这是每个家长共同的愿望。
    要使子女成为一个有知识和具有高尚道德的人，我认为不只限于多读几年书，多学习一些书本知识，而且应该在劳动过程当中锻炼，使他们获得实际的生产知识，在劳动中培养他们的劳动观点，提高他们的政治觉悟。
    在家庭的日常生活当中，家长应该同学校密切合作，除监督子女完成家庭作业以外，还应该注意子女的品德教育，要孩子养成艰苦朴素、热爱劳动的习惯，只要他们能够做的，尽可能让他们做，如洗领巾、手绢、袜子、整理房间、洒扫院子等。此外，家长还可以向子女讲一些劳动人民在旧社会中生活和读书的困难，这对于教育子女正确的对待升学问题也是有帮助的。
    今后每年都有一部分中、小学毕业生不能升学。学生家长应该协同政府、学校，共同把不能升学的中、小学毕业生的思想教育和安置工作做好。这也是家长义不容辞的责任。
