    Prospects for Sino-Japanese Trade
    Japan　Kimura Kihachiro
    (I)
    According to the statistics of the Japan-China Import and Export Association, the total value of Sino-Japanese trade in 1956 is estimated at 50 million pounds (140 million US dollars), an increase of 40% compared with 1955. Comparing this with the actual trade volume of the first Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement (3.03 million pounds during the one year and four months of implementation), the actual trade volume of the second agreement (23.28 million pounds during the one year and two months of implementation), and the actual trade volume of the third agreement (33.809 million pounds during the one year of implementation), it can be seen how rapidly the scale of Sino-Japanese trade has expanded in the past four and a half years.
    However, the total value of Sino-Japanese trade in 1956 only accounted for 2.5% of Japan's total foreign trade in the same year. Compared with the pre-war figure of 16.4% in 1930, the current proportion is still very low, although it is accelerating.
    The fact that Japan's trade with China has sharply decreased compared with the pre-war period, and the fact that Japan's trade dependence on the United States has greatly deepened, are significant features of the changes in Japan's trade structure after the war. The changes are shown in the following table: Changes in the proportion of Japan's trade with the United States and China in foreign trade
    The significant increase in Japan's trade dependence on the United States and the extreme reduction in trade with China have brought great disadvantages to the Japanese economy in at least the following three aspects:
    First, importing rice, soybeans, coal, and iron ore from the distant United States increases the production costs of Japanese industrial products and increases the burden on consumers. Not only that, but in order to reduce production costs to facilitate overseas competition, capitalists lower workers' wages, implement production rationalization and equipment modernization, and lay off workers, increasing unemployment and underemployment, and shifting the burden of high-priced raw materials onto workers and the general public.
    Second, due to the increased dependence on the United States, the Japanese economy is subject to the fluctuations of the US economic situation and is in a very unstable state.
    Third, due to the increased dependence on the United States, the United States' control over the Japanese economy has also been strengthened, which hinders the development and expansion of Japan's independent trade.
    (II)
    However, judging from two recent events in Japan, it is imperative to develop Sino-Japanese trade rapidly.
    The first event occurred in the Japanese national budget for fiscal year 1957. The Japanese national budget for fiscal year 1957 was compiled based on the “Economic Plan for Fiscal Year 1957 (Showa 22)” formulated by the Economic Planning Agency. According to this plan, the estimated exports for fiscal year 1957 are 2.8 billion US dollars (an increase of 12.9% compared to the previous fiscal year), imports are 3.2 billion US dollars (an increase of 10% compared to the previous fiscal year), the level of industrial and mining production is 255.5 (with the average level of 1934-1936 as 100), which is 12.5% higher than the previous fiscal year, and the national income is 818 billion yen (an increase of 7.5% compared to the previous fiscal year). Assuming a national income of 818 billion yen, if taxes are levied according to the tax system of fiscal year 1956, about 200 billion yen more in tax revenue can be collected than the budget amount for fiscal year 1956. Of this approximately 200 billion yen, after deducting approximately 100 billion yen for reducing income tax, the remaining approximately 100 billion yen can be used as a source of funds for increasing budget expenditures. This is the basic principle of the 1957 budget.
    It can be seen from this that if exports cannot reach 2.8 billion US dollars, the planned targets for industrial and mining production and national income will not be achieved, and therefore, the increase in tax revenue of approximately 200 billion yen will be out of the question. In this case, tax cuts and increased budget expenditures will be difficult to achieve, and the basic principles of the 1957 budget will completely fail.
    Therefore, in fiscal year 1957, it is imperative to complete the export of 2.8 billion US dollars. However, the export plan of 2.8 billion US dollars is based on the premise that "the world economy is expected to continue to maintain a high degree of prosperity in fiscal year 1957." However, it is estimated that in the second half of 1957, the world economy, especially the US economy, will decline. This will make the export of 2.8 billion US dollars difficult. In addition, because the 1957 budget also contains inflationary factors, in order to prevent inflation, it is necessary to increase imports, and increasing imports requires increasing exports. Therefore, the need to resolutely expand Sino-Japanese trade has become an urgent matter.
    Second, is the employment issue, which is even more fundamental than the first. Pre-war Japan was troubled by population problems, and new and special population problems have arisen after the war, resulting in an extremely serious labor employment problem. This is due to the net increase of 5.06 million people after repatriation and demobilization, especially due to the sharp increase in the population that can participate in production (estimated to increase by an average of about 1.1 million people per year in the next ten years or so, more than twice the pre-war population growth rate, a scale and speed that has not been seen in European and American countries), the extension of the population's lifespan (the average lifespan has been extended by 16 years for men and 17 years for women), and the relative increase in women (about 2 million more than men), the number of people looking for jobs is increasing significantly. Despite this, labor employment is still subject to the free competition of the survival of the fittest, and large enterprises are laying off personnel due to automation. Therefore, even in the case of economic improvement in 1955 and 1956, the number of fully unemployed people reached 600,000, an increase compared with the economic recession periods of 1949 and 1950, and the employment conditions of general workers have also deteriorated sharply. Needless to say, the US military's occupation of farmland and fishing areas as bases has made the employment problem even more serious.
    Therefore, whether it is the Hatoyama Cabinet, the Ishibashi Cabinet, or the Kishi Cabinet, they have all had to regard full employment as a top priority policy. Perhaps any future cabinet will have to focus on employment policies.
    However, solving the employment problem is extremely difficult. If we do not break away from the past position of subordination to the United States and take decisive new measures, the problem cannot be solved.
    According to the Economic Planning Agency's estimates, "It will take ten years to provide jobs for the 2.2 million new graduates and currently underemployed people who increase each year, reaching a modern level of employment. To this end, in the next ten years, the scale of the economy must be expanded at an annual rate of 8.5%, so that the gross national product will reach 185 trillion yen in 1965, and 31.9% of the gross national product must be used for accumulation and investment. Moreover, the import scale in 1965 must be increased to 6.94 billion US dollars."
    In this way, the import scale of 6.94 billion US dollars in 1965 will be more than double the import plan for 1957. Needless to say, such imports must be supported by greater exports, at least twice as much as the export plan for 1957.
    To this end, the Japanese economy must be closely integrated with the Asian economy. Currently, major changes are beginning to take place in Asia. The Soviet Union attaches great importance to the development of Siberia in its Sixth Five-Year Plan. China will enter the stage of implementing its large-scale Second Five-Year Plan from 1958. The new changes brought about by the large-scale planned economies of the Soviet Union and China have the full potential to maintain economic stability and prosperity. If Japan can use its industrial strength to assist the Soviet Union and China in developing economic construction and become an organic part of the Asian economy, it can solve the difficult employment problem and open up a path to survival.
    Mr. Kazuo Suzuki (Executive Director of the Japan-China Trade Association) said: "The question is where should Japan seek the direction of its economic development? Should it follow the past and seek it in the United States? Or should it seek prosperity and stability in the promising Asian market? Is it a good idea to abandon the United States and seek China? When considering this, it should be seen that if the Japanese economy is regarded as one of the pillars of Asian economic development, Japan will establish an independent and autonomous economy. If we become one of the undertakers of the historical changes in the Asian economy, it will be impossible for the United States to exert pressure on us."
    Judging from the above two events, Japan is currently in a situation where it must accelerate the development of Sino-Japanese trade. However, in terms of the international situation and domestic conditions, it is not enough to rely solely on the strength of the Japanese people. This requires the Japanese government to take more active action. In order to adapt to China's Second Five-Year Plan and export a large number of complete sets of equipment, the Japanese government needs to provide guarantees and allow China to establish trade representative offices in Japan. Without this, it will be difficult to accelerate the development of Sino-Japanese trade. (Attached chart)

    日中贸易展望
    日本　木村禧八郎
    （一）
    据日中输出入协会的统计，1956年的日中贸易输出入总额估计为五千万英镑（一亿四千万美元），比1955年增加了40％。如果和第一次日中贸易协定的实际贸易额（执行期间一年四个月）三百零三万英镑、第二次协定的实际贸易额（执行期间一年两个月）二千三百二十八万英镑、第三次协定的实际贸易额（执行期间一年）三千三百八十万九千英镑加以比较，就可以知道在过去四年半期间，日中贸易的规模是如何迅速地扩大了。
    然而，1956年的日中贸易输出入总额，只占同年日本对外贸易总额的2.5％。这同战前1930年日中贸易额占日本对外贸易总额16.4％比较起来，现在的比例虽然在加速地上升，但它还是很低的。
    日本对中国贸易比战前锐减这一事实，和日本贸易对美依赖程度的大大加深，是战后日本贸易结构变化的显著特征。这种变化的情况有如下表：日本对美国、中国贸易在对外贸易中所占比例的变化
    日本贸易对美国依赖程度的显著增大，和对中国贸易的极度减少，至少从以下三方面给日本经济带来很大不利：
    第一，从遥远的美国输入米、大豆、煤、铁矿石，使日本工业品的生产费用提高，增加了消费者的负担。不仅如此，资本家为了减低生产费用以利于海外竞争，就压低工人工资，实行生产合理化和设备现代化，裁减工人，使失业和半失业人口增加，把高价原料的负担转嫁到工人和一般国民身上。
    第二，由于对美国依赖程度的增大，日本经济就受美国经济情况的变动所左右，而处于极不稳定的状态。
    第三，由于对美国依赖程度的增大，美国对日本经济的控制也增强了，这就妨碍日本的自主贸易的发展和扩大。
    （二）
    可是，从最近日本方面发生的两件事情来看，必须急剧地发展日中贸易。
    第一件事情发生在1957年度的日本国家预算上。1957年度的日本国家预算，是根据经济企划厅制定的
  “昭和22年度（1957年度）经济计划”编成的。根据这个计划，预计1957年度的输出为二十八亿美元（比前一年度增加12.9％），输入为三十二亿美元（比前一年度增加10％），工矿业生产水平为战前的（以1934—1936年的平均水平为100）255.5（比前一年度增加12.5％），国民收入为八万一千八百亿日元（比前一年度增加7.5％）。以国民收入八万一千八百亿日元为前提，如果按1956年度的税制征税，比1956年度的预算额可以多征约两千亿日元的税金。在这约两千亿日元之中，去掉减少所得税的大约一千亿日元，剩下的约一千亿日元可以作为增加预算支出的财源。这是1957年度预算的基本方针。
    由此可见，如果输出不能达到二十八亿美元的话，工矿业生产水平和国民收入也都不能完成计划指标，由此，约二千亿日元税收的增加也就没有指望了。这样一来，减税和增加预算支出就难于实现，1957年度预算编制的基本方针也将完全破产。
    因此，在1957年度，无论如何必须完成二十八亿美元的输出。可是，二十八亿美元的输出计划是以“估计世界经济在1957年度仍然继续保持高度繁荣”为前提条件的。然而，据估计，在1957年下期，世界经济特别是美国的经济繁荣将要下降。这就会使二十八亿美元的输出遭到困难。此外，因为1957年度预算还包含着通货膨胀的因素，所以为了防止通货膨胀，就必须增加输入，而增加输入又非要增加输出不可。因此，必须断然地扩大日中贸易，就成为迫不及待的事了。
    第二，是比第一件事情更带有根本性的就业问题。战前日本就为人口问题所苦恼，战后又发生了新的特殊的人口问题，结果劳动就业问题极端严重。这就是由于战后复员和遣返，人口净增五百零六万，特别是由于能参加生产的人口的激增（估计今后十几年内每年平均增加一百一十万人左右，超过战前人口增长率的两倍，这样的规模和速度是欧美各国所没有过的）、人口的寿命延长（平均寿命，男延长十六年，女延长十七年）、妇女的相对增加（比男子约多二百万）等原因，找职业的人数在显著地增加。尽管如此，劳动力的雇佣仍是听任弱肉强食地自由竞争，大企业则由于实行自动化而裁减人员。因此，就是在1955年、1956年经济好转的情况下，完全失业者也达到了六十万人，比1949年和1950年经济萧条时期还有了增加，而且一般劳动者的就业条件也极度恶化了，不用说，美军占用农田和渔区作为基地，使就业问题更加严重了。
    于是，鸠山内阁也罢，石桥内阁也罢，或是岸内阁，都不得不把完全就业作为一项最重要的政策。恐怕今后任何内阁也不得不把就业政策作为重点。
    可是，解决就业问题是极其困难的。如果不摆脱过去那样的从属美国的立场，断然采取新的措施，是不能解决问题的。
    根据经济企划厅的估算，“每年增加的新毕业生和现在不完全就业者二百二十万人都能有职业，达到现代水平的就业状态，需要十年的光景。为此，在今后十年间，要以年率8.5％的比例扩大经济规模，使国民生产总值在1965年达到十八万五千亿日元，而且必须用国民生产总值的31.9％作为积累，用在投资方面。而且1965年的输入规模必须增加到六十九亿四千万美元。”
    这样说来，1965年度的六十九亿四千万美元的输入规模，要比1957年度的输入计划增加一倍以上，不用说，要有这样的输入必须有更大的输出，至少也必须增加到1957年度输出计划的两倍半以上。
    为此，日本经济无论如何必须和亚洲经济紧密结合起来。目前，亚洲情况开始有了重大的变化。苏联在第六个五年计划中对开发西伯利亚非常重视。中国从1958年度进入实行大规模的第二个五年计划的阶段。苏联和中国由大规模计划经济所促成的新的变化，有充分的可能保持经济稳定和繁荣。日本如能利用自己的工业力量，协助苏联和中国发展经济建设，成为亚洲经济有机的一环，才能解决困难的就业问题，打开一条生路。
    铃木一雄氏（日中贸易会专务理事）说：“日本经济的发展方向是求之于何方的问题。是因循既往地求之于美国呢？还是向前途远大的亚洲市场寻求繁荣和稳定呢？舍美国而求中国是个好办法吗？这样考虑的时候，应该看到：如果把日本经济作为亚洲经济发展的支柱之一，日本就会建立起独立自主的经济来。我们如果成为亚洲经济的历史性变化的承担者之一，美国要对我们施加压力是不可能的。”
    从上述两件事情看来，日本当前正处在必须加速发展日中贸易的境况。可是，就国际形势和国内状况来说，单靠日本民间的力量是不行的。这需要日本政府采取更积极的行动。对于为适应中国第二个五年计划而大量输出成套设备，日本政府有必要加以保证，并允许中国在日本设立贸易代表机构。不这样，要想加速发展日中贸易是困难的。（附图表）
