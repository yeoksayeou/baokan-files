    A New Plan for a Family with Reduced Income
    By Zhou Yunliang, Member of Xinle Agricultural Cooperative
    My family is a middle-peasant household. Last year, most cooperative members increased their income, and five out of eight middle-peasant households that joined the cooperative at the same time as us also increased their income. However, my family's income decreased by one hundred yuan compared to the year before. My father and I couldn't understand it at first, and we even considered withdrawing from the cooperative to work independently for a few years.
    Why did my family's income decrease last year? After careful consideration, there are several reasons: First, our fields have relatively high yields, averaging 580 jin per mu. However, we have few laborers. With seven people to feed, we only have one full laborer and three half-laborers. In our team, households with high yields and few laborers rarely increased their income in the past; households with more laborers and poorer fields increased their income more significantly. This situation is unavoidable in the first year of joining the cooperative. Second, my father had a serious illness last year, which cost two hundred yuan. Third, the cooperative's management was poor last year, wasting a lot of seeds and labor, and the farm work in the fields was also done carelessly. We did a total of 500 workdays last year, which is not a small amount, but because the value of each workday decreased, my family's income was also lower than the year before. We don't blame the cooperative system. In the first year of running the advanced cooperative last year, many people who were not doing well before were able to breathe a sigh of relief, and those who never made new clothes before added several new outfits last year. We see this situation very clearly. As long as the cooperative can correct its shortcomings in its work this year, and we ourselves are more diligent, we will increase our income this year.
    Judging from the way things have been going in the past few months, the leaders of our cooperative are determined to correct their mistakes. Our cooperative director, Peng Xingyu, is old, experienced, and willing to listen to everyone's opinions. Other cooperative cadres now consult with us on everything they do, unlike last year when they acted on their own.
    Seeing that the heads of the cooperative are determined to run the cooperative well, and seeing that this year's production is more promising than last year's, we don't want to withdraw from the cooperative anymore. My father and I have made a calculation. Although my father can't work in the fields, he can make baskets. If he makes them for ten months a year, he can earn sixty yuan. He can also raise a cow for the cooperative, which will earn him fifty-five workdays a year. My wife can also raise five ducks, ten or so chickens, and two pigs at home, which will bring in about one hundred yuan. If my daughter and I work harder, we will strive to do 500 workdays this year (including my father's work points for raising the cow). It is estimated that even if the price per workday is calculated according to last year's price at the time of the autumn harvest distribution this year, we can still earn more than 740 yuan, which is an increase of 125 yuan compared to the year before we joined the cooperative.
    Since the beginning of spring, my daughter and I have already done more than forty workdays. The first batch of baskets woven by my father will soon be taken to the streets to sell.

    一个减收户的新打算
    新乐农业社社员  周云良
    我家是个中农户。去年大部分社员都增加了收入，和我们同时入社的几户中农，也有五分之三增加了收入。但是，我家算起来，却比前年减收了一百元。我和爹爹一时想不通，曾经打算退出去单干几年再说。
    去年为什么我们一家会减少收入呢？仔细想起来有几个原因：第一、我们的田产量比较高，平均每亩收成五百八十斤。可是，我们劳动力少，七口人吃饭，只有一个整劳动力，三个半劳动力。我们这一小队，过去产量高劳力少的户很少增加收入；劳动力多，田底子较差的收入就增加得比较多。这样的情况，在入社第一年也是难免的。第二、去年我爹爹生了一场重病用了二百块钱。第三、社里去年管理不得法，种子、人工等浪费了不少，田里的农活也做得很马虎。我们去年一共做了五百个劳动日，并不算少，就因为劳动日价值降低，我家的收入也就比前年减少了。我们并不怨合作社的制度不好。去年第一年办高级社，社里就有好多本来生活不好的都喘过气来了，从来不做新衣服的去年也添了好几身。这种景况我们都看得很清楚。只要合作社今年能够改正工作上的缺点，我们自己再勤一点，今年是会增加收入的。
    看最近这几个月的样子，我们社里的领导上是有决心改正错误的。我们的社主任彭兴余，年纪大，有经验，也肯听大家的意见。别的社干部现在做什么事也都要同我们商量，不像去年那样自作主张了。
    看到社里当家人有决心把社办好，看看今年生产比去年希望更大，我们也不想退社了。我和爹爹算了一笔账。我爹爹虽不能下地，却会做篮子，一年做十个月，就可以挣到六十元。他还可以替社里养一只牛，一年可得五十五个劳动日。我老婆在家再养五只鸭子，十来只鸡，还有两只猪，又可收入一百元左右。我和我女儿再加紧点劳动，今年争取做五百个劳动日（连我爹爹养牛的工分在内），估计到今年秋收分配时，一个劳动日单价即使按去年的计算，我们还是可收入七百四十多元，比前年未入社时还可增加一百二十五元。
    开春以来，我和我女儿已经做了四十多个劳动日。我爹爹编的第一批篮子马上可以拿上街去卖了。
