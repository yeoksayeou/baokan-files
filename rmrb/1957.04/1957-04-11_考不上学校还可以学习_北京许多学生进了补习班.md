Still Can Study Even if You Don't Pass the School Entrance Exam
Many Beijing Students Enter Tutoring Classes

According to Xinhua News Agency, more than 2,400 elementary school graduates in Beijing who didn't pass the middle school entrance exam last year are now living normal learning lives in tutoring classes.

These tutoring classes are scattered in more than 30 middle and elementary schools with relatively good foundations in Beijing. There are full-time teachers who give them lessons, mainly reviewing Chinese and arithmetic from the fifth and sixth grades of elementary school. These schools are doing everything possible to squeeze out classrooms for them to attend classes, and at the same time, they are helping them organize self-study groups to concentrate on reviewing their lessons in the students' homes.

The No. 12 Girls' Middle School in Beijing has attached two tutoring classes. The director of the school office is responsible for leading the teaching work of these two classes. They attend classes with the students of the school every morning, and use the dining hall for self-study in the morning and afternoon. Teachers also provide tutoring during self-study.

All schools pay special attention to giving them the same treatment as students in the school in many aspects, such as allowing them to participate in the school's Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers activities and cultural and recreational life, borrowing books, etc.

From 1953 to now, more than 16,000 elementary school graduates in Beijing have studied in tutoring classes attached to various schools over the years. Last year, the vast majority of students who participated in tutoring classes were admitted to junior high school, and some others participated in service industry jobs and went to factories as apprentices.

    考不上学校还可以学习
    北京许多学生进了补习班
    据新华社讯　北京市去年没有考上中学的两千四百多个小学毕业生，现在补习班里过着正常的学习生活。
    这些补习班分散在北京市三十多个基础较好的中、小学校里，有专任教师给他们上课，主要是复习小学五、六年级的语文和算术。这些学校都想尽办法挤出教室让他们上课，同时帮助他们组织自学小组，在学生的家庭里集中复习功课。
    北京市第十二女子中学附设了两个补习班，学校办公室主任负责领导这两个班的教学业务，他们每天上午和本校学生在一起上课，早晨和下午利用饭厅自习，自习时还有教师辅导。
    各校特别注意在许多方面给他们和在校学生一样的待遇，如让他们参加学校里的团、队活动和文化娱乐生活，借阅书籍等。
    从1953年到现在，北京市历年来在各校附设补习班学习的小学毕业生已有一万六千多人，去年参加补习班的学生绝大部分都考上了初中，另有些人参加了服务行业的工作和进工厂当学徒。
