    A Trip to Užice
    By our correspondent Ji Jianbo

    A Visit to a Mountain City in Bright Spring
    On Sunday, April 7th, I accompanied Wu Xiuquan, our ambassador to Yugoslavia, and other comrades from the embassy on a visit to Užice. This city is located in the mountains about 200 kilometers southwest of Belgrade and is one of the county towns in the Republic of Serbia. It is neither a scenic area nor a major industrial base. The sole reason for our visit to this place was out of admiration for it. Because Užice was one of the heroic cities of the Yugoslav people's armed uprising against the German fascist invaders during World War II, and its name was well known to Chinese comrades as early as World War II.
    Influenced by the oceanic climate, the weather in Yugoslavia is often cloudy and changeable, and there are not many sunny and clear days. But this day was an exceptionally good one, with a gentle breeze, bright sunshine, and a beautiful spring. We departed from Belgrade by car at eight o'clock in the morning, traveling southwestward at a speed of 60 to 80 kilometers per hour on a flat road. At first, the car ran along the left bank of the famous Sava River, the river flowing quietly, with birds flying gently over it from time to time. The green trees on the bank were reflected in the river, and the lilac and crabapple flowers along the road bloomed so brightly, as if smiling and welcoming the passing guests. Spring here is very inviting.
    After driving for about an hour, the car entered a winding mountain road, and blooming fruit trees, scattered red-roofed farmhouses, and gray flocks of sheep were seen from time to time on the hillsides on both sides. Later, we learned that the people in this area mainly rely on animal husbandry and orchards for their livelihood, and the grain yield is not high. After climbing over three mountain tops of more than 800 meters, we drove into the city of Užice, surrounded by mountains, and it was already noon.
      The Heroic Užice
    After entering the city center, we were greeted by Milan Yevtovich, the chairman of the city district, Mirko Popovich, the secretary of the Užice County Committee of the League of Communists, and Olga Zevkovich, the secretary of the district committee, and other local responsible comrades. While we were shaking hands and greeting each other, a large group of people had gathered around us. Although we could not understand their language, it could be seen that they were also there to welcome the Chinese guests. The hosts warmly and cordially led us into the office building of the County People's Committee. In the conference room, the hosts introduced us to the heroic history and current situation of Užice.
    Due to its advantageous terrain, Užice became an important base for the guerrillas to strike the enemy in the early stage of the National Liberation War. On September 24, 1941, the Yugoslav guerrillas liberated Užice from the puppet army for the first time. At that time, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the headquarters of the Yugoslav guerrillas, and the headquarters of the Serbian guerrillas were all located here. The office building of the County People's Committee is now the site of the former Serbian guerrilla headquarters, and the bullet marks on the walls are still striking. At the foot of the mountain on the east side of the city, there is a large stone cave. It is said that this cave was used to store gold by the bank before the war, but the guerrillas turned it into an ammunition factory, using the machines of a pre-war hunting rifle factory to manufacture 25,000 rifles and more than 2 million rounds of ammunition and grenades for the guerrillas. These weapons and ammunition greatly strengthened the strength of the people's armed forces at that time. At that time, the central organ of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, "Borba" (The Struggle), was located in the building diagonally opposite the Serbian guerrilla headquarters. Now it is a shop. The guerrillas persisted here for three months in the face of constant enemy attacks. Later, they retreated on November 29 due to a large-scale attack by the German invaders. The battle at that time was very fierce. In the battle to defend the Central Committee and the guerrilla headquarters, 300 armed workers sacrificed their lives on a mountain 12 kilometers west of the city. During the entire war, almost all the men, women, and children in this city participated in the struggle. 90% of the people in the county participated in the war, and 1,200 people shed their last drop of blood for the cause of liberation. When the First Guerrilla Detachment withdrew from Užice, one of its battalions was composed of people from Užice. The secretary of the County Committee told us that Užice had fifteen people who were awarded the title of People's Hero, but only three of them are still alive. One of them is a female comrade who joined the revolution at the age of fifteen and is holding a wedding ceremony today. When we heard this, we immediately asked him to convey the congratulations of the Chinese comrades to her. District Chairman Milan Yevtovich is also one of these three. He, County Committee Secretary Popovich, and District Committee Secretary Zevkovich are all local people who joined the revolution in 1941.
    The hosts led us to visit the city and the 1941 People's Uprising Museum located at the foot of the eastern mountain. The headquarters building of the Yugoslav guerrillas and the weapons exhibition hall, which constitute an important part of the museum, were being repaired at the time, so we only looked at them from the outside. At the corner of the headquarters building, there was a captured German tank. After visiting the guerrilla ammunition factory, we climbed to the small hill on the east side of the city. The graves of the guerrillas are here. From this hilltop, not only can you have a panoramic view of the entire city, but you can also see the surrounding situation very clearly. At this time, the host pointed out to us where the mountain was where the workers carried out the defense battle in those years, where the slope was where the German invaders massacred patriots in large numbers, and told us that there was a wounded soldiers hospital 20 kilometers away from the city, and 400 to 500 wounded soldiers were killed by the enemy because they did not have time to evacuate.
      Užice Today
    Užice (renamed Tito Užice after liberation) has a population of 180,000 (45,000 households) in the entire county, divided into 23 districts. The urban population was 8,000 before the war and is now 17,000. There are 5,000 members of the League of Communists in the county, and 1,650 members in the city district. Members of the Socialist Alliance of Working People account for 70% of the voters in the county. There are three factories in the city district, with 6,000 workers, and 65 full-time administrative cadres in the city district. The city district has one each of senior high school, normal school, technical school, apprentice school, and workers' night school. In addition, there are six eight-year schools, with a total of 3,600 students.
    Užice has a theater with 220 seats, and plans to build another theater with 700 seats. There are currently three cinemas with a total of 1,300 seats. In order to solve the housing problem, the District People's Committee and factories have allocated 300 million dinars from the housing fund this year to build 200 houses for employees.
    The host told us that Užice is a relatively barren mountainous area, and the grain yield is not high. For example, the average wheat yield is only 800 kilograms per hectare, and the average corn yield is 1,000 to 1,200 kilograms per hectare. Fruit trees and animal husbandry are relatively developed. In terms of animal husbandry, the average household has ten sheep, two to three pigs, and fewer cattle, with an average of less than one head per household.
        Returning with Friendship
    In Užice, as in other parts of Yugoslavia, Chinese comrades are always treated with brotherly hospitality by Yugoslav comrades, making you feel that you are not in a foreign country, but as if you have come to your own home, where you can talk to each other without any restraint. Yugoslav comrades are very happy to tell visiting foreign friends about their past experiences and today's situation, which undoubtedly can enhance foreign friends' understanding of Yugoslavia and deepen the friendship between each other.
    When we visited the 1941 People's Uprising Museum, Comrade Zivkovic, the curator of the museum, gave us a rifle made by the guerrilla ammunition factory as a souvenir. This is indeed a good souvenir, which will not only make us always remember the arduous revolutionary struggle and friendship between our two peoples in the past, but also constantly remind our two peoples not to relax the struggle against the enemies of socialism and peace.
    When we returned to Belgrade, it was already nine o'clock in the evening. Although everyone felt very tired, everyone felt that the day was very pleasant because they brought back the friendship of the Yugoslav comrades in Užice.

    乌日采纪游
    本报记者　纪坚博
    春光明媚访山城
    4月7日是个星期天，记者随我国驻南斯拉夫大使伍修权及使馆其他同志们访问了乌日采。这个城市座落在贝尔格莱德西南约二百公里的群山中间，是塞尔维亚共和国的县城之一。它既不是风景区也不是什么大工业基地。我们访问这个地方的唯一原因是出于对这个地方的景仰。因为乌日采是第二次世界大战中南斯拉夫人民武装起义反对德国法西斯侵略者的英雄城市之一，它的名字早在第二次世界大战期间就为中国同志们所熟知了。
    因受海洋气候的影响，南斯拉夫的天气经常是阴霾多变的，晴和明朗的日子并不太多。但是这一天却是稀有的好天气，真是风和日丽，春光明媚。我们在早晨八点钟乘车由贝尔格莱德出发，在平坦的公路上，以每小时六十至八十公里的速度一直向西南驶去。开始时，汽车傍着有名的萨瓦河左岸行驶，河水静静地流着，不时有鸟儿轻轻地在它上空飞过。岸边的绿树倒映在河中，路旁的丁香花和海棠花开得那样鲜艳，好像在向过路的客人们含笑欢迎。这里的春天是十分诱人的。
    汽车大概行驶了一个多小时以后，即进入了三回九转的山道，在两边的山坡上不时看到盛开的果树，疏疏落落的红色屋顶的农舍和灰色的羊群。后来知道这一带人民主要靠畜牧业和果园业为生，谷物产量是不高的。爬过了三座八百多公尺的山头以后，我们才驶进了群山环抱的乌日采城，这时已经是正午了。
      英雄的乌日采
    我们进入市中心以后，刚一下汽车就遇到了前来迎接的市区主席米兰·叶夫托维奇、共产主义者联盟乌日采县委书记米尔科·波波维奇和区委书记奥尔加·热夫科维奇等几位当地的负责同志。在我们握手互相问候的时候，周围已经聚集了一大群人，虽然言语不通，但是可以看出来，他们也是来欢迎中国客人的。主人们热情而亲切地把我们引入县人民委员会的办公楼，在会议室里主人们向我们介绍了乌日采的英雄历史和现状。
    乌日采由于它的有利地势，在民族解放战争初期成了游击队打击敌人的重要基地。南斯拉夫游击队在1941年9月24日第一次由伪军手中解放了乌日采，当时南共中央、团中央、南斯拉夫游击队总部和塞尔维亚游击队总部都设在这里。现在县人民委员会的办公楼就是当年塞尔维亚游击队总部所在地，墙上弹痕斑斑，仍然触目。在城东面山脚下有个大石洞，这个石洞据说在战前曾是银行储藏黄金的地方，但游击队却把它变成了军火工厂，利用战前猎枪工厂的机器，为游击队制造了二万五千支步枪和二百多万发子弹和手榴弹。这些武器弹药大大加强了当时人民武装的力量。当时南共中央机关报“战斗报”就在塞尔维亚游击队总部斜对过的大楼里。现在这里是一座商店。游击队在敌人不断进攻中，在这里坚持了三个月。后来因德寇大举进攻，才在11月29日撤退。当时的战斗是很激烈的，在保卫中央和游击队总部的战斗中，在城西十二公里的一个山头上曾经有三百个武装工人献出了生命。在整个战争期间这个城市的男女老幼几乎都参加了斗争，全县90％的人参加了战争，有一千二百人为解放事业流了最后一滴血。当第一游击支队由乌日采撤退时，其中有一个营就是由乌日采人组成的。县委员会书记告诉我们乌日采曾有十五个人荣获人民英雄称号，但现在还活着的只有三个人了。其中有一个是女同志，她十五岁就参加革命，刚好今天举行结婚典礼，我们听到这里当即请他转达中国同志对她的祝贺。区主席米兰·叶夫托维奇也是这三个人中的一个。他和县委书记波波维奇和区委书记热夫科维奇都是本地人，都是在1941年参加革命的。
    主人们领着我们参观了市区和座落在东山脚下的1941年人民起义博物馆。构成博物馆重要部分的南斯拉夫游击队总部大楼和武器陈列馆，因当时正在修理，我们只在外边看了一下。在总部大楼的墙角下摆着一辆缴获的德国坦克。在参观了游击队军火工厂后，我们便爬上了城东面的小山头。游击队员墓就在这里。在这个山头上，不仅对全城可以一览无余，而且对周围的形势也可以看得很清楚，主人这时指给我们哪里是当年工人们进行保卫战的山头，哪里是当年德寇大批屠杀爱国者的山坡，并告诉我们离城二十公里远当年有一伤兵医院，因为来不及撤退有四五百伤员被敌人杀害。
      乌日采的今天
    乌日采（解放后命名为铁托乌日采）全县人口有十八万（四万五千户），分为二十三个区，城区人口战前为八千人，现为一万七千人。全县有五千名共产主义者联盟盟员，市区有盟员一千六百五十人。劳动人民社会主义联盟盟员占全县选民的70％。城区有三个工厂，工人有六千名，城区专职行政干部有六十五人。城区有高级中学、师范学校、技术学校、学徒学校、工人夜校各一所。另外八年制学校六所，共有学生三千六百人。
    乌日采有二百二十个座位的剧院一所，准备再增建七百个座位的剧院一所，现有电影院三所，共有一千三百个座位。为了解决住房问题，区人民委员会和工厂今年从房屋基金中拨出三亿狄纳尔准备为职工修建二百套住宅。
    主人告诉我们：乌日采是个比较贫瘠的山区，粮食产量是不高的，如小麦平均每公顷只产八百公斤，玉米平均每公顷只产一千到一千二百公斤。果木和畜牧业比较发达。就畜牧业来说，羊平均每户有十头，猪平均每户有二至三头，牛比较少些，平均每户不到一头。
        带着友谊回来
    在乌日采，像在南斯拉夫其他地方一样，中国的同志总是受到南斯拉夫同志们兄弟般的接待，使你感到不是在一个陌生的国度中，而好像是来到自己的家里一样，彼此可以毫不拘束地进行谈话。南斯拉夫的同志很喜欢把他们过去的经历和今天的情况告诉给来访问的外国朋友，这无疑可以增进外国朋友对南斯拉夫的了解和加深彼此间的友谊。
    在我们参观1941年人民起义博物馆的时候，博物馆的馆长日夫科维奇同志曾把当年游击队军火工厂制造的步枪一支送给了我们作纪念。这确是一个很好的纪念品，他不仅会使我们永远记起过去我们两国人民艰苦的革命斗争和友谊，也会时时提醒我们两国人民一刻都不要放松对社会主义和和平事业的敌人的斗争。
    回到贝尔格莱德的时候，已经是晚上九点钟了。大家虽然感到很疲倦，但大家却因为带回来乌日采的南斯拉夫同志们的友谊而觉得这一天过得很愉快。
