Xinhua News Agency, 12th - According to TASS: In early April, Soviet personnel setting out to establish the "North Pole-7" drifting ice scientific station flew to the Arctic in batches. This is the seventh drifting ice scientific station established by the Soviet Union in the Arctic region in the twenty years since 1937.

The staff of the scientific station will establish the station on drifting ice approximately nine hundred kilometers north of the "North Pole-6" scientific station (in the central Arctic region at 85 degrees North latitude), drifting along the route of the former "North Pole-3". "North Pole-3" drifted during a period of minimal solar activity, while this year is expected to be a period of maximal solar activity. The personnel of the new scientific station will conduct comparative research on phenomena related to this change. In addition to continuing the observation work of past drifting ice scientific stations, they will also conduct research work according to the plans of the International Geophysical Year. For the first time in the history of drifting ice station work, they will use specialized cameras to observe the aurora borealis, observe the ionosphere, record magnetic pole changes, and comprehensively observe solar radiation and the radiation characteristics of ice and snow. Most personnel will hold two professional positions concurrently.

Departing at the same time as these groups of staff were personnel to welcome the staff of the "North Pole-4" drifting ice scientific station and to replace the staff of the "North Pole-6" scientific station. The "North Pole-4" scientific station concluded its three-year-long extensive research work in mid-March. The drifting ice on which the scientific station was located drifted for one thousand and seventy-five days in the central Arctic region, covering a total of more than six thousand eight hundred kilometers, obtaining a large amount of scientific data. After experiencing the last "Arctic night" lasting one hundred and sixty days, they also carried out work to survey the movement of ice around the ice block, which was tens of square kilometers in size, recording the traces of the ice block's movement.

After the change of personnel at the "North Pole-6" scientific station, they will continue to drift north of Wrangel Island, conducting observations and work related to the International Geophysical Year together with "North Pole-7". In addition, the Soviet expedition team will also land at more than twenty locations in the central Arctic region to set up radio beacons and automatic weather stations on the ice.

    苏联科学家向北极进军
    “北极七号”科学站人员分批启程
    将在中央极区建立大批自动气象站
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社消息：4月上旬，苏联到北极去建立“北极七号”浮冰科学站的人员，分数批乘飞机飞往北极。这是苏联自1937年以来二十年中在北极地区建立的第七个浮冰科学站。
    科学站的工作人员将在“北极六号”科学站以北约九百公里（北纬八十五度的中央北极区）的浮冰上建立科学站，沿着当年“北极三号”的路线漂流。“北极三号”当年漂流的时期是太阳的动活最弱时期，而预计今年恰好是太阳活动最强的时期，新科学站的人员将对与这一变化有关的现象进行比较研究。除继续过去浮冰科学站的考察工作外，他们还将根据国际地球物理年的计划进行研究工作。他们将在浮冰站工作史上第一次用专门摄影机观察北极光，将观察电离层，纪录磁极变化，综合观察日光辐射和冰雪的辐射特性。大多数人员都将兼任两项专业工作。
    与这几批工作人员同时出发的还有迎接“北极四号”浮冰科学站人员和接替“北极六号”科学站的人员。“北极四号”科学站3月中旬结束了为时三年的巨大研究工作。科学站所在的浮冰在中央极区漂流了一千零七十五天，共走了六千八百多公里，获得了大量科学资料。在经历了最后一个长达一百六十天的“北极夜”之后，他们还在这块方圆几十公里的冰块周围进行了勘探冰块流动的工作，纪录了冰块的移动痕迹。
    “北极六号”科学站人员换班后，将继续在兰格尔岛以北漂流，同“北极七号”一道进行观测和有关国际物理年的工作。此外，苏联考察队还将在中央极区二十多个地点着陆，以便在冰上设置无线电标杆和自动气象站。（附图片）
