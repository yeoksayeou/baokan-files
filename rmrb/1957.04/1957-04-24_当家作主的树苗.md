    The Seedlings that are Masters of Their Own House
    By our reporter Ye Jianyun
    April, all things revive, full of vitality. In the State-owned Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, in the 41 hectares of factory and residential area, the newly planted 130,000 seedlings have sprouted tender green shoots.
    These new seedlings were planted one after another in February and March this year, and the people in the factory call them "the seedlings that are masters of their own house." Planting 130,000 seedlings is a considerable amount of labor. Last spring, many seedlings were also planted. At that time, more than a dozen temporary workers were hired to plant trees; but this year, planting 130,000 seedlings did not require hiring a single person. Who planted them? It was the masters of the enterprise – the factory's workers.
    The term "master of one's own house" is not unfamiliar to the workers of the No. 2 Factory. However, in the past, people only paid lip service to this term.
    The More Money, the More Problems
    Recalling the time before October of last year, the workers' production enthusiasm and labor zeal were generally still high; most workers were eager to improve; the factory's output and quality both exceeded the state's targets. However, there were also a few workers whose ideological understanding was unclear and whose work performance was not very good. Although these people were in the minority, their bad influence was expanding because they did not receive strong criticism. For example, some workers, if their hands were stained with oil, would find it too much trouble to use some soap to go to the washroom to scrub and wash, so they would just grab a handful of snow-white cotton, wipe it off, and throw it away. When machine parts were dirty and needed cleaning, they would scoop a full basin of gasoline, regardless of size or quantity, and spill it all over the ground, without anyone feeling sorry for it. The cleaning tools needed in the workshop were just short, thin bamboo poles wrapped with a little cotton yarn. The raw materials were readily available, and it would only take two or three minutes to make one, but no one was willing to do it. Some people didn't even see the bobbins and small machine parts scattered on the ground, while others found them in the way and kicked them far away; some even simply threw some small machine parts into the trash can as garbage. As for lax labor discipline and absenteeism, it was common in every workshop.
    In terms of daily life, the trend of extravagance and waste, comparing wealth, and aiming for high standards was equally serious. One female worker bought eight fancy shirts in less than half a year; if she bought one and it didn't fit, she would buy another. Another female worker bought six pairs of leather shoes in eight months, red, black, yellow, white, hard-soled, high-heeled, buying whatever she wanted, and throwing them away if they didn't fit. There was a table full of leftovers in the cafeteria. An inspection of 58 rooms collected 13 catties of white flour steamed buns. Some individual female workers only ate the filling of dumplings and threw the remaining skins everywhere. The peasants near the factory picked up a large pile of leftover steamed buns and rice from the factory's garbage dumps and sewers. They were so angry that they wrote to the factory to ask: Are you still like the working class when you waste food like this? Due to the excessive pursuit of enjoyment in life, some workers were not focused on production, and both output and quality were affected, and accidents occurred frequently.
    After the wage reform, the situation became even more serious. Some leaders of the factory originally thought that with increased wages and improved living standards, there would be fewer problems! The opposite was true; with more money, the trend of workers comparing food and drink and showing off their wealth became even more serious. Not only was labor discipline lax, but there were also individual young men and women who were morally corrupt. A considerable number of workers were not content with their work. They said: Labor is glorious, glorious for what? Running patrols and connecting yarn ends all day long, getting a sore back and aching waist, and only earning sixty yuan a month. Auxiliary workers wanted to become technicians, and technicians wanted to learn higher technology, all for the purpose of earning more wages. During this period, the idea of comparing wages and ranks caused a great uproar in the workshops.
    What to Do?
    After the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, the Party Committee of the No. 2 Cotton Mill also felt that if this continued, it would not only affect production but also seriously damage the ideological quality that the working class should have. Therefore, in conjunction with conveying the resolution of the Second Plenary Session, a series of ideological and political work was carried out among the workers. After education on being masters of one's own house, hard work and thrift, and running the enterprise diligently and frugally, the workers' ideological awareness and political understanding were generally improved. One female worker said, "In the past, I regarded the factory director as the owner of the enterprise, and I seemed to be an employee. Now I realize that this view is wrong. We are the masters of our own house in the factory."
    In order to explain this process of change clearly, it is necessary to explain how the factory's political work was done.
    After conveying the resolution of the Second Plenary Session, the Party Committee analyzed the specific situation of the factory: 80% of the factory's workers were young workers, with an average age of 22; and almost all of them had joined the factory after 1954. The characteristics of these new workers were: enthusiastic, energetic, with a certain level of education, and quick to accept new things. However, because they had just left school, had not participated in labor, lacked practical life experience, they loved fantasy and were afraid of hardship. In their studies, they were not very interested in theoretical reports, but they had a strong interest in listening to stories, visiting, and listening to veteran workers talk about their past life experiences. At the same time, the Party Committee also criticized the shortcomings of weak political work in the past, emphasizing the completion of production tasks, and neglecting ideological leadership. Although some political work had been done in the past, the methods were not correct, and education was not carried out in accordance with the characteristics of young workers, so the effect was not significant.
    After analyzing and examining the characteristics of the factory and the shortcomings in the past work, the Party Committee launched a lively and varied form of educational work.
    Endless Stories
    Storytelling is one of the most welcome forms for workers, especially young workers. After listening to some moving and inspiring stories of struggle, some workers shed tears, and some wrote diaries as long as several thousand words, examining their own shortcomings, and determined to use the actions of the heroes as their own example. For example, after listening to a series of stories, the female worker Mei Li examined herself and said, "I have forgotten my roots." Originally, this female worker's family life was very hard. Her father was a rickshaw puller, and he used to save money to send her to finish elementary school; later, because he could not afford to send her to a higher school, she was admitted to the No. 2 Factory as a helper. When she first came, she worked actively, saving a few yuan each month to take home to support the family, but later she gradually only cared about herself and not about her family. In order to buy a watch, she didn't have enough money, so she went back to her father to ask for it. Her father said, "Child, you don't need to buy a watch, the family can't even afford to eat!" She not only ignored her father's advice and bought the watch, but also made clothes out of high-quality materials. In her self-examination, she said: In the past, I was very reluctant to go home. Every time I went home, I saw my younger siblings wearing tattered clothes, but I dressed so luxuriously, and I felt sad. Sometimes I also thought about saving some money and taking more money back; but when I came to the factory and saw others wearing colorful clothes, my mind changed again. Later, I simply went home less often. Because my mind was focused on being particular about food and clothing, I was not focused on production, and when facing the machine, I was thinking about the women's tops in the fashion store. Before listening to these stories, I always thought that life was just about eating well and dressing well; now I know that the more important thing in life is for a happy and beautiful future...
    There were people like Mei Li who deeply examined themselves and had significant changes in their thinking in every workshop in the factory. Now, storytelling has become an indispensable part of the workers' lives. In the past, after returning to the dormitory, the male and female workers would only talk about some boring things, gossiping about who was handsome and who was ugly; otherwise, they would just make a fuss, fight, and quarrel; or they would go shopping and eat snacks; in a word, during their rest, they lived in a free and undisciplined environment. After launching the storytelling activity, it filled this gap in the workers' lives. At the beginning, some leaders were worried that there would not be so many stories to tell, and not so many people to tell them; now it has been proven that these worries were unnecessary. The material for storytelling is inexhaustible. Movies, short stories, newsletters, and the experiences of veteran workers have all become materials for storytelling. Moreover, the workers can tell stories themselves, and some tell them very vividly and touchingly. For example, a female worker in the combing and roving workshop told the workers about her family's past poverty and the tragic deaths of her father and sister. She said that our current workers are unaware of the happiness they are in. These kinds of experiences of veteran workers have a great effect on enlightening the class consciousness of young workers and understanding the origin of the current happy life.
    Go to the Countryside and See
    In addition to storytelling, they also visited the countryside in a planned way. When visiting the Datunqiu Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wuqing County, the agricultural labor model Wang Yuzhen gave them a report: Last autumn, the Longfengxin River breached its banks, and in order to build the embankment to prevent floods, more than 300 members did not close their eyes for five days and five nights, and repaired five weirs; in times of tension, they used their bodies to block the impact of the wind and waves. Wang Yuzhen's children had no one to take care of them, and others advised her to go home and see her children, but she said: "Flood prevention and disaster relief is a matter for everyone in the cooperative. For the sake of everyone, I will not leave the front line until we win the battle." The workers were deeply moved after hearing such moving deeds of loving the cooperative as a home. At that time, some people suggested that they should learn from Wang Yuzhen after returning to the factory and love the factory as their home.
    Another group visited the Guanyintang Cooperative in the suburbs of Beijing. The members told them about the process of cotton production. Some young female workers who had just left school and had grown up in the city expressed on the spot that cotton is hard-won, and they must pay attention to saving cotton in the future. After the visit, more than 700 workers spontaneously went to help several agricultural cooperatives near Guanyintang to pull 300 mu of cotton stalks. When eating, everyone no longer threw away food randomly. If anyone intentionally wasted food, the masses would automatically intervene.
    In winter, they also visited the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. They saw the ironworkers in the high-temperature workshop, wearing short jackets and pants, and their sweat soaking their clothes. At that time, some workers examined themselves and said, "This is real labor! We are constantly comparing wages and ranks, and we are not at ease with this or that. Comparing ourselves with them, we are really ashamed."
    When the comrades in the factory who did Party work talked about the changes between last spring and this spring, they said: Last spring, petty-bourgeois ideas ran rampant freely, but this year, although it is "another year of fragrant grass is green," the second line is not "still ten miles of apricot blossoms are red," but "a generation of new workers is renewed."

    当家作主的树苗
    本报记者　叶剑韵
    4月，万物逢春，生机勃勃。在国营北京第二棉纺织厂里，在四十一公顷的厂区和住宅区内，新栽下的十三万株树苗，已经抽出了嫩绿的新芽。
    这一片新苗，是今年2、3月间相继栽种的，厂子里的人把它叫做“当家作主的树苗”。栽种十三万株树苗，劳动量是相当可观的。去年春天也曾种过不少的树苗，那时候为了种树，雇了十几个临时工；可是今年种十三万株，却没有雇一个人。谁栽的呢？是企业的主人——厂里职工们栽的。
    当家作主这个词儿，对二厂的职工说来并不是生疏的。可是，过去这个词儿人们只是挂在嘴头上。
    钱越多问题越多
    回忆去年10月以前，工人们的生产积极性和劳动热情整个说来还是很高的；多数工人是要求进步的；厂里的产量和质量都超额完成了国家的指标。但也有少数工人思想认识不清楚，工作表现不很好。这种人虽是少数，但由于未能得到有力的批判，坏的影响在扩大着。如有些工人手上沾了油污，连用点肥皂，到盥洗室擦一擦洗一洗都嫌麻烦，随手抓一把雪白的棉花，揩一揩就扔掉了。机件脏了，要洗，不看大小多少，一舀就是满满一盆汽油，泼泼洒洒，流得一地，谁看了也不心痛。车间里要用一种清洁工具，一根短短的细竹杆缠上一点点棉纱条就成了。原材料现成，两三分钟就可以做一把，却没人肯干。散在地下的筒管子、小机物料，有的人像没看见一样，有的人嫌碍眼，用脚踢得老远；有的人甚至干脆把一些小机物料当成垃圾扔到垃圾箱里去了。至于劳动纪律松弛，旷工缺勤的情形，更是那个车间都有。
    在生活方面，铺张浪费，比阔气，向高标准看齐的风气同样严重。有一个女工不到半年买了八件花衬衣；买一件，不合适，再买一件。另一个女工在八个月中间买了六双皮鞋，红的、黑的、黄的、白的，硬底的、高跟的，想要就买，不合适就扔。食堂里剩菜剩饭满桌子都是。检查了五十八个房间，光白面馒头就收集了十三斤。个别女工，吃饺子只吃馅儿，剩下的皮子到处乱扔。厂区附近的农民，从这个厂的垃圾堆里、阴沟里捡回了一大堆剩馒头剩饭，他们气不过，写信来厂里责问道：你们这样糟踏粮食，还像工人阶级不像？由于过分追求生活上的享受，有些工人生产时间精力不集中，产量质量都受到影响，事故不断。
    工资改革以后，情况更加严重。原来工厂的部分领导同志认为，工资增加了，生活改善了，问题要少一些吧！事实恰恰相反，钱多了，工人中间比吃喝、比阔绰的风气更严重了。不仅劳动纪律松弛，还有个别的男女青年道德败坏。有为数不少的工人不安心工作。他们说：劳动光荣，光荣个啥，一天到晚跑巡回、接纱头，累得腰酸背痛，一个月只挣六十块。辅助工想当技术工，技术工想学更高的技术，目的是为了多拿工资。这时期，比工资比级别的思想闹得车间里满城风雨。
    怎么办
    二中全会以后，国棉二厂党委员会也感到这样下去不仅影响生产，而且严重地损害工人阶级应有的思想品质。于是，结合传达二中全会的决议，在工人中进行了一系列的思想政治工作。经过当家作主、艰苦朴素、勤俭办企业等教育以后，工人的思想觉悟、政治认识普遍提高了。一个女工说：“以前，我把厂长看成企业的主人，自己好像是个雇工。现在认识到这种看法错了。厂子里当家作主的是我们自己。”
    为了说清楚这个变化的过程，得交代一下这个厂的政治工作是怎么做的。
    在传达了二中全会的决议以后，党委分析了本厂的具体情况：全厂青年工人占80％，平均年龄二十二岁；而且差不多全是1954年以后入厂的。这些新工人的特点是：热情，有朝气，有一定的文化水平，接受新鲜事物快。但是由于刚出学校门，没参加过劳动，缺乏实际生活的锻炼，爱幻想、怕艰苦。在学习上，对理论性强的报告兴趣不大，而对讲故事、参观、听老工人谈谈过去的生活经历，却有浓厚的兴趣。党委同时也批判了过去政治工作薄弱，强调完成生产任务，忽视思想领导的缺点。过去虽然也做了一些政治工作，但是方法不对头，没有针对青年工人的特点进行教育，因此效果不显著。
    党委根据工厂的特点和过去工作上的缺点进行了分析和检查之后，开展了生动活泼的多种形式的教育工作。
    说不完的故事
    讲故事，是工人特别是青年工人最欢迎的形式之一。工人们听了一些可歌可泣的斗争故事以后，有的流泪，有的写了长达数千字的日记，检讨自己的缺点，决心用英雄们的行动作为自己的榜样。如女工梅丽，在听了一系列的故事以后，自我检讨说：“我忘本啦。”原来这个女工家庭生活很苦，父亲是三轮车工人，过去省吃俭用送她读完了小学；后因无力升学，考进二厂做帮接工。刚来的时候，工作积极，每个月省几个钱捎回家去维持家用，后来就渐渐只顾自己不顾家庭了。为了买手表，自己的钱不够，就回去向父亲讨。她父亲说：“孩子，不用买表哪，家里饭还吃不上哩！”她不仅不听老人的劝告，买了表，还做了高级料子的衣服。她在自我检讨时说：过去，我很不愿意回家，一回家，看见弟妹们穿得破破烂烂的，自己却打扮得那样阔绰，心里就酸。有时也想节省节省，多捎些钱回去；可是来到厂里看到别人穿得花花绿绿的，心又变了。后来索性少回家。由于心思花在讲究吃穿上，生产时精力不集中，面对着机器，脑子里却在想时装店的女上装。在没听这些故事以前，我总认为人生在世，就是为了吃的好穿的好；现在我知道了，人生更重要的是为了幸福美好的将来……
    像梅丽这样深刻检查自己，并在思想上有显著转变的人，全厂那个车间都有。现在讲故事已经成为工人们生活中必不可少的一件事了。过去男女工人们回到宿舍以后，尽扯些无聊的事儿，张三长李四短，谁俊谁丑；不然就是瞎起哄，打、吵嘴；再不就是逛大街吃零食；一句话，在休息的时候，他们是生活在一种自由散漫的环境里。开展讲故事的活动以后，正好填充了工人生活上的这一段空白。开始时，领导方面也有人顾虑没这么多的故事讲，没这么多的人去讲；现在证实了这些顾虑是不必要的。讲故事的材料是取之不尽的。影片、短篇小说、通讯报告、老工人的经历，都成了说故事的材料。而且工人们自己会讲，有的还讲得很生动，很感人。如梳并粗车间一个女工就把过去家庭的贫苦境遇和父亲姐姐惨死的遭遇讲给工人们听。她说，我们现在的工人是身在福中不知福。这类老工人的经历，对启发青年工人的阶级觉悟，认识目前幸福生活的由来，有很大的作用。
    到农村去看看
    除了讲故事以外，他们还有计划地访问了农村。在访问武清县大顿丘农业生产合作社时，农业劳动模范王玉珍为他们作了报告：去年秋天，龙凤新河决口，社员们为了筑堤防水，三百多人五天五夜没合眼，抢修了五条围堰；在紧张的时候，他们用自己的身子挡住了风浪的冲击。王玉珍家里的孩子没人照顾，别人劝她回家看看孩子，她说：“防洪抢险是社里大伙的事，为了大家，不打胜仗决不下火线。”工人们听了这种爱社如家的动人事迹后，深为感动。当时就有人提出回厂后要学习王玉珍，做到爱厂如家。
    另一部分人参观了北京郊区观音堂合作社。社员们为他们讲了棉花生产的过程。有些刚出学校门自幼在城市里长大的青年女工们当场就表示：棉花来之不易，今后一定要注意节约用棉。参观后，工人们还自发地先后去了七百多人，帮助观音堂附近几个农业社拔了三百亩棉秸。吃饭的时候，大伙再不乱扔饭菜了。谁要是有意糟蹋粮食，群众就自动干涉。
    冬天，又参观了石景山钢铁厂。他们看到炼铁工人在高温车间里，穿着短褂裤，汗水淌湿了衣服。当时就有工人检讨说：“这才是真正的劳动哩！我们整天在比工资比级别，这也不安心那也不安心，比比人家真羞死了。”
    当厂里做党的工作的同志谈起去年春天和今年春天的变化时，他们说：去年春天是小资产阶级思想自由泛滥，今年哩，虽然是“又是一年芳草绿”，下联却不是“依然十里杏花红”，而是“焕然一代新工人”了。
