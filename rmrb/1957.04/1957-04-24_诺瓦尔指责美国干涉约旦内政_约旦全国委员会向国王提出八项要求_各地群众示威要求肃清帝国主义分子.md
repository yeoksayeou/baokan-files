Comprehensive report from our newspaper: Former Jordanian Army Chief of Staff Nuwar revealed to the "Al-Ra'i" newspaper in Damascus on the 22nd that the U.S. Embassy in Jordan was interfering in Jordan's internal affairs.

Nuwar said, "A month before the dismissal of former Prime Minister Nabulsi's cabinet, the palace, the U.S. Embassy, and some politicians acting as agents of the Eisenhower Doctrine exerted strong pressure on me to organize a military cabinet with me as prime minister. Former Prime Minister Rifai told me that he guaranteed that the palace and the U.S. Embassy agreed to me becoming prime minister." Colonel Sweeney, the U.S. Embassy's military attaché, wanted him to facilitate the mission of Eisenhower's special envoy, Richards, to Jordan.

Nuwar demanded that the new Halidi cabinet resign immediately. He said that this cabinet's "purpose is to serve as a bridge through which imperialism can eliminate all enlightened elements in Jordan, forcibly make Jordan accept the Eisenhower Doctrine, separate Jordan from Syria and Egypt, and link Jordan to the Baghdad Pact."

He said, "Its (the Halidi cabinet's) current goal is to eliminate nationalist elements in the military and non-military sectors." He condemned the royal palace for organizing a military commission "to carry out this elimination operation."

Nuwar also said that the Jordanian government's so-called policy of continuing to pursue active neutrality and opposing imperialism is pure deception.

The day before, former Jordanian Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Rimawi told a reporter from Egypt's "Al-Gomhuria" that U.S. imperialism is the mastermind behind the current crisis in Jordan, and its aim is to concentrate its forces to attack Jordan, in order to attack Syria and ultimately isolate Egypt.

Rimawi said that the United States is trying to create an atmosphere in Jordan suggesting that resistance would lead to an invasion by Israeli or Iraqi forces.

Jordanian Prime Minister Halidi defended his government in a radio address on the evening of the 22nd. He said that his government was striving to pursue a "free Arab policy." The remarks made by Hayari and others in Damascus were "groundless."

Halidi once again denied that U.S. Ambassador to Jordan Mallory had engaged in activities interfering in Jordan's internal affairs.

According to Cairo Radio, the Jordanian National Guidance Committee (a joint organization of Jordanian left-wing parties) presented eight demands to King Hussein on April 22 regarding the resolution of the current political crisis in Jordan. The eight demands are as follows:

一、Release the officers who have been expelled from the army and reinstate them to their positions;
二、Recall the officers who have taken refuge outside Jordan;
三、Remove certain individuals from the royal palace;
四、Dissolve the investigation committee established to interrogate the expelled officers;
五、Organize a parliamentary committee to investigate the recent military clashes in Zarqa, Jordan;
六、The Halidi government resign and form a national unity government based on a policy of solidarity with Egypt and Syria and opposition to the Eisenhower Doctrine;
七、The U.S. Ambassador and military attaché to Jordan leave Jordan;
八、Establish a national court to try traitors and those engaged in political and military conspiracies.

On the 21st and 22nd, a wave of demonstrations swept through some towns in Jordan. Demonstrators demanded the rejection of the Eisenhower Doctrine and the establishment of a new coalition government; demanded the reinstatement of nationalist officers and the release of those detained; demanded the dismissal of the chief of the royal court, and the purging of imperialist elements in the royal palace, state organs, and the army.

According to an Associated Press report, reliable sources in Damascus said on the 22nd that King Hussein of Jordan denied to Syrian President Kuwatly the news that Iraqi troops had entered Jordan. At the same time, Iraqi officials also denied that Iraqi troops had entered Jordan. (Attached picture)

    诺瓦尔指责美国干涉约旦内政
    约旦全国委员会向国王提出八项要求
    各地群众示威要求肃清帝国主义分子
    本报综合报道　前约旦陆军参谋长诺瓦尔22日在大马士革接见“舆论报”记者时揭露，美国驻约旦大使馆干涉约旦内政。
    诺瓦尔说，“在前首相纳布西的内阁解职前一个月，宫廷、美国大使馆和一些充当艾森豪威尔主义的代理人的政客对我施加强大的压力，要我组织一个以我为首相的军事内阁。前首相里法伊对我说，他保证宫廷和美国大使同意我当首相。”而美国大使馆武官斯温尼上校要他给艾森豪威尔的特使理查兹来约旦执行任务创造方便条件。
    诺瓦尔要求哈利迪新内阁立即辞职。他说，这个内阁的“目的是要作为一个桥梁，使帝国主义可以通过它来消灭约旦国内所有的开明分子，强使约旦接受艾森豪威尔主义，并且把约旦同叙利亚和埃及拆开，而使约旦同巴格达条约联结起来。”
    他说：“它（哈利迪内阁）现在的目的是想消灭军界和非军界的民族主义分子。”他谴责王宫组织一个军事委员会“来实现这种消灭行动”。
    诺瓦尔还说，约旦官方所谓继续奉行积极的中立主义和反对帝国主义的政策，纯粹是欺人之谈。
    在前一天，前约旦外交国务大臣里马维对埃及“共和国报”记者说，美帝国主义是目前约旦危机的幕后主谋者，它的目的在于集中力量打击约旦，以攻击叙利亚和最后孤立埃及。
    里马维说，美国设法在约旦造成一种气氛，暗示如果进行抵抗就会引起以色列军队或是伊拉克军队的入侵。
    约旦首相哈利迪22日晚间在一次广播演说中为他的政府辩护。他说，他的政府竭力奉行“自由阿拉伯政策”。哈亚里和其他人在大马士革所发表的言论是“毫无根据的”。
    哈利迪再一次否认美国驻约旦大使马洛里曾经进行干涉约旦内政的活动。
    据开罗电台广播，约旦全国指导委员会（约旦左翼党派联合组织）4月22日向国王侯赛因提出了关于解决目前约旦政治危机的八项要求。八项要求的内容如下：
    一、释放被逐出军队的军官，并恢复他们的职位；二、召回在约旦境外避难的军官；三、把某些人赶出王宫；四、解散为审讯被逐军官而设立的调查委员会；五、组织一个议会委员会来调查最近在约旦的扎卡所发生的军队冲突；六、哈利迪政府辞职，成立一个以同埃及和叙利亚团结、反对艾森豪威尔主义的政策为基础的民族联合政府；七、美国驻约旦大使和武官离开约旦；八、成立全国法庭审讯卖国贼和进行政治和军事阴谋活动的人们。
    在21日和22日，约旦的一些城镇激荡着示威游行的浪潮。示威游行者要求拒绝艾森豪威尔主义和成立新的联合政府；要求恢复民族主义军官的职位，释放被拘禁的人；要求将宫廷总管革职，并且在宫廷、国家机关和军队中肃清帝国主义分子。
    另据美联社报道，大马士革可靠人士22日说，约旦国王侯赛因向叙利亚总统库阿特利否认伊拉克军队已经进入约旦的消息。同时，伊拉克的官方人士也否认伊拉克军队开进了约旦。（附图片）
