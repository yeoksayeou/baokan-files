    Three Rings Around the Moon
    On the evening of January 15th, the weather in Wuqing County (midway between Beijing and Tianjin) was severely cold. According to Beijing's sounding records, the air temperature at an altitude of 9,000 meters was very low, reaching below minus 50 degrees Celsius. Water vapor in the air directly froze into many tiny ice crystals. These small ice crystals gathered together, floating in the sky, forming a thin, milky white cloud layer like light gauze, called cirrostratus. That night, this type of cloud was also commonly seen in the Beijing and Tianjin areas.
    The structure of ice crystals is mostly hexagonal prisms, with regular hexagons on the top and bottom surfaces. When moonlight passes through these ice crystals, it acts like a prism, causing refraction. The ice crystals continuously rotate and float in the sky, resulting in many continuous refracted light rays. These light rays illuminate a certain distance in the sky from the sun, and these light spots appear like scenes in a movie before the observer's eyes, revealing a halo around the moon. This halo is faint in color, slightly tinted with color, and people often call it a "halo." However, the floating ice crystals are arranged in various positions in the sky, some horizontally, some vertically, and some diagonally. Therefore, the angle of minimum deviation of the refracted light will not be the same, and the resulting halos will also be different.
    That night, around nine or ten o'clock, the position of the moonlight was moderate, and the cirrostratus clouds above Wuqing County were relatively high and thin. Under such conditions, it was possible to see many beautiful halos appearing simultaneously.
    In northern regions (high latitudes), cirrostratus clouds often appear. As long as the position of the moonlight is moderate, there are many opportunities to see the beautiful halo phenomenon. According to statistics from a meteorological station in eastern Gansu, it occurred six times in half a year from January to June 1953. The occurrence of this phenomenon is a manifestation of ice crystal clouds in the upper atmosphere. ·Zhong Kan·

    三环套月
    1月15日晚上，武清县（在北京到天津的中间）天气严寒。从北京探空记录来看，在九千公尺高空的空气温度非常低，达到摄氏零下五十度以下。空中水汽直接冻结成许多细小的冰晶。这些小冰晶聚集起来，飘浮在天空，形成像轻纱一样薄的乳白色的云层，叫卷层云。那天晚上，北京、天津一带也普遍出现了这种云。
    冰晶的结构，大多是六角柱体，顶面和底面是正六角形的。当月亮光线通过这些冰晶体的时候，便起到像三棱镜一样的折射作用。冰晶体在天空不断旋转飘浮，就有许多连续不断的折射光线，在太阳某一个一定距离的天空，照得很亮，这些光点，像电影一样一幕幕地出现在观察者的眼前，显现了月亮周围的光环。这种光环，颜色暗淡，略带彩色，人们常常叫它为“晕”。不过飘浮的冰晶，在天空排列的位置是各式各样的，有横列，有竖直，也有斜倒，因此光线折射的偏向最小，角度不会相同，出现的光环也不会一样。
    那天晚上九、十点钟，月亮光线位置适中，武清县上空的卷层云比较高而薄，在这样的条件下，可能看到许多美丽的光环同时出现。
    在偏北地区（高纬度）经常出现卷层云，只要月亮光线位置适中，出现美丽的晕珥光象机会很多。据甘肃东部一个气象站的统计，在1953年1至6月份，半年里就出现过六次。这种光象的发生，是高空有冰晶云的表现。·钟　侃·
