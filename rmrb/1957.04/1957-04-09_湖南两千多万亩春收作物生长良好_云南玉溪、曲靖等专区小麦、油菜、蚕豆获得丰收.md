Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 7th -- In Hunan Province, most of the over 25.7 million mu of spring harvest crops are growing well. According to the person in charge of the Hunan Provincial Department of Agriculture, if these spring harvest crops do not suffer severe natural disasters in the later stages of growth, the yield will not be lower than last year.

Currently, the more than 3 million mu of rapeseed among the spring harvest crops have generally blossomed. It is reported that in Qianyang, Shaoyang and other regions where rapeseed is widely planted, many places may increase production compared to last year. Cili County may see large-scale bumper harvests of rapeseed, with "10,000 mu yielding 10,000 dan." Most of the province's more than 5 million mu of wheat has grown to over a foot high, with generally neat and robust seedlings.

This year, the area sown with spring harvest crops in Hunan Province has expanded by more than 4.4 million mu compared to last year, accounting for 44% of the province's cultivated land. Since sowing last winter, these spring harvest crops have suffered from winter drought and spring frost. Agricultural cooperatives in various regions have mostly taken timely measures to rescue them, achieving good results.

This newspaper reports: This newspaper reporter Chen Yongjin reports: In the vast plains and river valleys of Yuxi, Qujing, Chuxiong, Wenshan, Dali, Zhaotong, Lincang, Mengzi and other regions of Yunnan Province, news of bumper harvests has been reported. In these areas, wheat is golden, broad bean leaves are already scorched black, and rapeseed is taller than people, with dense seed pods. In some places, the spring crops have already begun to be harvested. The head of Dajie Agricultural Cooperative in Jiangchuan County told the reporter: Fang Jiaen, an old farmer in his seventies, said that he had never seen such good rapeseed as this year. This year, high-yield rapeseed areas can yield 540 jin per mu. The Dajie Agricultural Cooperative can harvest more than 220,000 jin from rapeseed alone; 780 mu of broad beans can also harvest about 370,000 jin. The broad beans of Haihu Township Agricultural Cooperative in this county, on average, yielded 525 jin per mu.

    湖南两千多万亩春收作物生长良好
    云南玉溪、曲靖等专区小麦、油菜、蚕豆获得丰收
    新华社长沙7日电　湖南省两千五百七十多万亩春收作物大部分生长良好。据湖南省农业厅负责人说，如果这些春收作物在生长后期不遭受严重的自然灾害，产量将不会低于去年。
    现在，春收作物中的三百多万亩油菜已经普遍开花。据反映：播种油菜较多的黔阳、邵阳等专区，许多地方都可能比去年增产。慈利县可能出现油菜“万亩万担”的大面积丰收。全省五百多万亩小麦，大部分已经长到一尺多高，一般麦苗整齐、茁壮。
    今年湖南省春收作物播种面积比去年扩大四百四十多万亩，占全省耕地面积的44％。去冬播种以来，这些春收作物曾经先后遭到冬旱和春冻。各地农业社大多及时采取各种措施，加以抢救，收到了较好的效果。
    本报讯　本报记者陈勇进报道：云南省玉溪、曲靖、楚雄、文山、大理、昭通、临沧和蒙自等专区的广大的平坝和河谷地带，都传来了丰收的喜讯。在这些地区，小麦一片金黄，蚕豆叶已经焦黑，油菜高过人头、结籽稠密。有些地方小春作物已经开始收割了。江川县大街农业社社长告诉记者：七十多岁的老农方家恩说，从来没有见过像今年这样好的油菜。今年高产地的油菜每亩可以收到五百四十斤，仅仅油菜一项，大街农业社就可收获二十二万多斤；七百八十亩蚕豆也可收到三十七万斤左右。这个县海浒乡农业社的蚕豆，每亩平均却收到五百二十五斤。
