The Birth of Sanmenxia City
Xinhua News Agency Reporter Jun Qian, Chen Jian

    A new city is born: Sanmenxia City. It is located on the south bank of the Yellow River, east of Tongguan and west of Luoyang. Its predecessor was a small town on the Longhai Railway—Huixing Town—and several rural villages near the Yellow River's Sanmenxia, originally belonging to Shan County, such as Huangdi. This new city was born amidst the construction boom of the motherland, established by the state for the development and management of the Yellow River and the construction of the Sanmenxia Water Control Project. Now, the Yellow River Sanmenxia Engineering Bureau is located here.

    Huixing Railway Station
    Traveling west along the Longhai Railway, entering the valley area of western Henan, you soon arrive at Huixing Railway Station. This inconspicuous fourth-class station has become lively due to the development and management of the Yellow River. Over the past few years, countless water conservancy and geological surveyors and experts have visited here, as have many international friends, writers, and poets. Now, the construction of the Sanmenxia Water Control Project is about to begin. The station area is filled with various types of machinery needed for the project, extending all the way to a 40,000-square-meter equipment warehouse. Every day, this station welcomes trains loaded with equipment and new guests. Forty-five-ton cranes produced by the Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory stand like giants at the station, responsible for unloading machinery from all over the country. Now, their massive arms are even busier. Some of this machinery comes from Qiqihar in the Northeast, and some from Guiyang in the Southwest. The stationmaster told reporters that in 1956, seven thousand railcars delivered goods for the Sanmenxia construction site, which is equal to seven times our previous annual transportation task. And this year's transportation task will be even greater.

    Many cadres of the Yellow River Sanmenxia Engineering Bureau know that when they first arrived here a year ago, they stepped off the train into a wilderness. At that time, there was only one dim oil lamp at the station at night. Now, the station and its vicinity are ablaze with electric lights at night.

    Huixing Town
    Huixing Town, located about half a kilometer from the station, is the center of the new Sanmenxia City.

    This ancient town was devastated and desolate by the flames of war during the Anti-Japanese War. In the year of liberation, there was only one traditional Chinese medicine shop in the town. When the Henan Support Sanmenxia Project Office was established here last April, there were only eleven small-scale merchants and vendors. The streets were piled with garbage and debris, and many houses were tilted and collapsing. At the south end of the town was a 150-square-meter stinking pool, threatening the health of the residents.

    Now its appearance has completely changed. Many new houses have appeared in the town, and a burgeoning industrial area market has taken shape here. The town now has a post and telecommunications bureau, a bank, a bookstore, and more than eighty specialized commercial outlets selling general merchandise, cloth, cultural goods, and medicine (the entire city, including the worker villages of Daan and Shijiatan, has over a hundred outlets). There is also a well-equipped hospital relocated from Dalian and Lushun in the Northeast. There are even more service-oriented merchants and vendors who have moved from all over Henan to support the Sanmenxia project. The town has bathhouses and sophisticated barbershops, and girls now have places to get their hair permed. The stinking pool on the south side of the town has been filled in and covered with bamboo sheds, forming a market; next to it, a theater that can accommodate more than 1,000 people has been newly built. The Henan Yu Opera Theater and some prefectural professional troupes perform here continuously for workers and farmers. During the Spring Festival this year, amateur theater troupes from nearby agricultural cooperatives also performed here for the workers. In the past, residents of the town relied on drawing water from wells more than fifty meters deep; now they have running water. The town's workers' club has been completed. Next to the club is a reading room, and its honor roll regularly displays the deeds and photos of the city's advanced producers. On market days and holidays, this is the bustling center of the entire town.

    The newly completed office building and apartment dormitory of the Yellow River Sanmenxia Engineering Bureau are located about one kilometer from Huixing Town. The Engineering Bureau's six affiliated factories will also be built here. This area will be connected to Huixing Town to form the city center. In the future, after the construction of the Sanmenxia's huge reservoir is completed, this will become a scenic lakeside city.

    Sanmenxia
    Located about fifteen kilometers from Huixing Town is the Yellow River Sanmenxia. The Sanmenxia's gorge and mountainous area is now an important part of this new city. It is connected to Huixing Railway Station and Huixing Town by roads, and a railway connecting to Huixing Railway Station is also under construction.

    This quiet river valley, where in the past one could hear nothing but the sound of the Yellow River, is now seething with socialist construction life. The remote villages of Shijiatan and Daan near Sanmenxia, located at the foot of the mountains and along the river, have now been built with over 70,000 square meters of red-tiled brick houses, becoming densely populated workers' villages. The mountain ridges along the river are steep, and in the past, there were only winding paths passable by donkeys. Now, roads have been built along the river, with cars crisscrossing back and forth.

    The south bank of the Sanmenxia River valley will be the site of the dam in the future. The hillsides are covered with tents from bottom to top. A suspension bridge with iron cables is erected over the river, connecting to the north bank, where more than 1,400 square meters of factory buildings serving the construction have also appeared. There are also a few drilling towers standing in the river valley. Now, the iron bridge connecting the north and south banks to serve the construction has started construction, and the banks of the river valley are piled with a lot of equipment, with the roar of various machines and human voices echoing in the valley.

    三门峡市的诞生
    新华社记者　君谦　陈健
    一个新的城市诞生了，这就是三门峡市。它在潼关以东、洛阳以西的黄河南岸，它的前身是陇海铁路上的一个小镇——会兴镇和黄河三门峡附近原属陕县的黄底等几个乡的农村。这个新城市是在祖国建设声中诞生的，是国家为开发治理黄河兴修三门峡水利枢纽工程建立的。现在，黄河三门峡工程局就设在这里。
    会兴车站
    沿陇海铁路西行，进入河南西部的峡谷地带，不久，便到了会兴车站。这个一向不为人们注意的四等小站，因开发和治理黄河热闹起来了。几年来，不知道有多少水利、地质的勘测人员和专家到过这里，有多少国际友人到过这里，多少作家和诗人到过这里。现在，兴修三门峡水利枢纽工程快开工了。车站附近摆满了各种工程所需的机械，一直摆到一个四万平方公尺的器材仓库。每天，这个车站都迎接着成列车的器材和新的客人。大连机车车辆厂出产的四十五吨的大吊车像巨人一样立在车站上，担负着从火车上吊下各地运来的机械的任务，而现在它的巨大的臂膀更忙了。这些机械，有的来自东北的齐齐哈尔，有的来自西南的贵阳。这个车站的站长告诉记者说：1956年有七千个车皮为三门峡工地送货，这等于我们以往全年运输任务的七倍。而今年的运输任务，还要大得多。
    黄河三门峡工程局的很多干部都知道，一年以前他们初到这里时，下了火车还是一片旷野。那时候，夜晚车站上只有一盏昏暗的油灯。现在的夜晚，车站上和车站附近都是一片辉煌的电灯。
    会兴镇
    距离车站约一华里的会兴镇是新的三门峡市的中心。
    这个古老的小镇，在抗日战争时期被战火烧得衰落荒凉了。解放那年镇上只有一家中药铺。去年4月，河南支援三门峡工程办事处在这里成立时，也仅有十一户小商小贩。街上堆满垃圾杂物，房屋多已歪斜倒塌。镇南头有块一百五十平方公尺的臭水坑，威胁着居民的健康。
    现在它的面貌全变了。镇上出现了很多新房，一个初具规模的工区市场在这里形成了。全镇已经有邮电局、银行、书店以及百货、布匹、文化用品、医药等八十多个专业性的商业门市部（全市连同大安、史家滩等工人村有上百个门市部）了。还有从东北旅大迁来的一所设备完善的医院。那些从河南各地搬来支援三门峡工程的各种服务性的商贩就更多了。镇上有了浴池和讲究的理发店，姑娘们已经有地方烫发了。镇南面的臭水坑填平了，上面盖了竹棚子，形成一个市场；旁边新建了一座可容纳一千多人的剧场，河南豫剧院和一些专区的职业剧团，不间断地在这里为工人和农民演出。今年春节，附近农业社的业余剧团，也在这里为工人演出过。过去镇上的居民依靠从五十多丈深的井汲水吃，现在已经有自来水了。镇上的工人俱乐部落成了。俱乐部旁边还设有阅览室，它前面的光荣榜上，经常公布有全市的先进生产者的事迹和照片。在逢集和过节的日子，这里是全镇的热闹中心。
    黄河三门峡工程局新落成的办公大楼和楼房宿舍，离会兴镇约二华里。工程局的六个附属工厂也要在这里兴建。这里将和会兴镇联成一片，成为市的中心。将来三门峡的巨大水库建成后，这里将成为一座风景幽美的湖滨城市。
    三门峡
    距离会兴镇约三十华里是黄河三门峡，三门峡的一片峡谷山地，现在是这个新市的重要组成部分。这里和会兴车站和会兴镇有公路连接，连接会兴车站的铁路也正在施工。
    这个过去除了听黄河水声而外什么也听不到的幽静的河谷，现在沸腾着社会主义的建设生活。三门峡附近山脚河边的史家滩、大安等荒僻村庄，现在盖起了七万多平方公尺红瓦砖房，成了人烟密集的工人村。河边山岭陡峭，过去只有通行毛驴的曲折小道。现在沿河修成了公路，交驰着往返的汽车。
    三门峡河谷南岸将来是筑坝的地方，山坡上从下到上都是帐篷。河上架设着铁索吊桥和北岸相通，北岸也出现了一千四百多平方公尺的为施工服务的厂房。河谷中还有少数矗立的钻塔。现在连接南北两岸为施工服务的铁桥已经动工了，河谷两岸堆了很多器材，河谷中喧嚣着各种机器的吼声和人声。
