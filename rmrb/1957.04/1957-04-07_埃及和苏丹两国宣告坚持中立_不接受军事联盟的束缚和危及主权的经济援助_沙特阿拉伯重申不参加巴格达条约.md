The communiqué stated that the two countries fully support the Arab policy of active neutrality, are determined to stay out of the Cold War, and reject any attempts to bind the two countries to military alliances. At the same time, the two countries will maintain friendly relations with those countries that are friendly to them, based solely on the interests of the Arab world.
