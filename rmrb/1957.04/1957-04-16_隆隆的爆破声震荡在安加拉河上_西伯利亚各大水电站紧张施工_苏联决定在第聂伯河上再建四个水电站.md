Xinhua News Agency, 15th Dispatch. TASS reported: The roaring sound of explosions echoes incessantly over the Padun shoals on the Angara River in Siberia. Blasting workers constructing the world's largest Bratsk Hydroelectric Station (with a generating capacity of 3.6 million kilowatts) are collecting earth and stone, preparing to dam this turbulent river.

Many blasting workers climbed along the bare, steep rocky walls on both sides of the Angara River, blasting down hundreds of tons of diabase and gravel. The hundreds of thousands of cubic meters of stone material they collected on the left bank had already cut off the tributary on the right bank on March 30th, causing all the river water to flow into the narrow tributary on the left bank. On that single day, within ten hours, two hundred dump trucks filled seven thousand cubic meters of stone into the riverbed.

This year, the blasting workers will provide a total of more than 500,000 cubic meters of stone material for the dam and auxiliary enterprises of this hydroelectric station. By the time the hydroelectric station is completed, at least ten trainloads of explosives will have been used just for collecting building materials.

The construction of auxiliary enterprises and the "Bratsk Sea" reservoir of the Bratsk Hydroelectric Station construction site is accelerating simultaneously. Fifteen logging industrial enterprises are clearing trees in the future seabed. Before the river overflows into the reservoir, the loggers will have to cut down 533,000 hectares of dense forest.

The first cascade of the Angara River, the Irkutsk Hydroelectric Station, will have four hydraulic generating units generating electricity this year. The "Irkutsk Sea" has been storing water since last autumn, and has now stored 1.1 billion cubic meters of water. Water sports enthusiasts will be able to drive speedboats on the sea this year.

A 648-kilometer-long high-voltage transmission line connecting the Irkutsk and Bratsk hydroelectric stations is being erected. The 250,000 cubic meters of earthwork and 70,000 cubic meters of concrete pouring work for the entire line are gradually coming to an end. Approximately 1,200 metal power line poles have been erected. The first section of the transmission line near Irkutsk City has been erected, and the high-voltage transmission line is extending through forests, mountains, and swamps towards Bratsk.

The construction of the Novosibirsk Hydroelectric Station on the Ob River has entered a decisive stage, and the first phase of the project will soon be completed. Now, the hydroelectric station building has risen on the left bank of the river, and a reinforced concrete dam has blocked the riverbed. Inside the hydroelectric station building, preparations are being made for the installation of turbines. On the right bank of the river, the construction of the ship lock is accelerating. After this year's spring flood, the first batch of ships will begin to pass through here.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 15th Dispatch. A cascade of hydroelectric stations is taking shape on the Dnieper River, the second largest river in the European part of the Soviet Union. In addition to the already completed Dnieper Lenin Hydroelectric Station and Kakhovka Hydroelectric Station, the Soviet Union has decided to build four more large hydroelectric station cascades upstream – Dniprodzerzhynsk, Kremenchuk, Kaniv, and Kyiv Hydroelectric Stations.

The first power generation cascade on the Dnieper River, the Lenin Hydroelectric Station, generated electricity in May 1932. At that time, it was famous as the largest hydroelectric station in Europe. The second cascade, the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Station, was completed last year. These two hydroelectric stations only utilize half of the water level difference (100 meters) of the Dnieper River from Kyiv to the Black Sea. In order to fully utilize the untapped hydropower resources, the Soviet government has decided to build four more large hydroelectric stations upstream on this river. Among them, the Kremenchuk and Dniprodzerzhynsk hydroelectric stations with generating capacities of 400,000 kilowatts and 350,000 kilowatts, respectively, have already begun construction. The final designs of the Kaniv and Kyiv hydroelectric stations are nearing completion and construction will begin next year.

After these four new hydroelectric stations on the Dnieper River are completed, this nearly 1,000-kilometer section of the great river flowing through Ukraine will be filled with a series of hydroelectric stations and large reservoirs. The electricity they produce will completely change the electricity supply situation in the entire Ukraine, and the navigation conditions of the Dnieper River will also be thoroughly improved. Large-tonnage ships will be able to sail directly from the Black Sea to below the city of Kyiv.

    隆隆的爆破声震荡在安加拉河上
    西伯利亚各大水电站紧张施工
    苏联决定在第聂伯河上再建四个水电站
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社报道：隆隆的爆破声在西伯利亚安加拉河上巴东滩地区终日回响不绝。建筑世界最大的布拉次克水电站（发电能力为三百六十万瓩）的爆破工们正在采集土石，准备拦断这条汹涌的河流。
    许多爆破工人沿着安加拉河两岸光秃秃的陡峭岩壁爬上去，把成百吨的辉绿岩和砂石炸落下来。他们在左岸采集的几十万公方石料已经在3月30日截断了右岸的支流，使河水全部流向左岸狭窄的支流。单是在这一天的十个小时内，两百辆自动卸货卡车就往河床上填了七千公方的石块。
    爆破工今年总共将为这个水电站的堤坝和附属企业提供五十万公方以上的石料。到水电站建成的时候，单是为了采集建筑材料就至少要用去十列车的炸药。
    布拉次克水电站工地上的附属企业和水电站水库——“布拉次克海”的建设工作同时在加速进行。十五个伐木工业企业正在未来的海底清除树木，在河水溢入水库以前，伐木工人将要砍伐完五十三万三千公顷的大密林。
    安加拉河的第一个梯级伊尔库次克水电站，今年将有四台水力联动机发电。“伊尔库次克海”从去年秋季开始纳水以来，现在已经储水十一亿立方公尺。水上运动爱好者今年就可以在海面上驾驶快艇。
    联结伊尔库次克和布拉次克水电站的长达六百四十八公里的高压输电线正在架设中。全线的二十五万公方土方工程和七万公方混凝土浇灌工程正在陆续结束。约一千二百根金属电线支柱已经竖立起来。伊尔库次克市附近的第一工段输电线已经架设好了，高压输电线正通过森林、群山和沼泽向布拉次克方面延伸。
    鄂毕河上的新西伯利亚水电站的建设工程进入了决定性的阶段，第一期工程很快就要完工。现在，河左岸已经耸起了水电站厂房，钢筋混凝土堤坝拦断了河床。水电站厂房中，正在为安装涡轮机进行准备工作。在河右岸，船闸的建筑工作在加速进行。今年的春汛过后，第一批船只就将开始通过这里。
    新华社莫斯科15日电　苏联欧洲部分第二大河第聂伯河上的水电站阶梯正在形成。除了已经建成的第聂伯列宁水电站和卡霍夫卡水电站以外，苏联又决定在它的上游再建设四个大水电站梯级——第聂伯罗捷尔任斯基、克列门楚格、卡涅夫和基辅水电站。
    第聂伯河上的第一个发电站梯级列宁水电站在1932年5月发电，它当时曾以欧洲最大的水电站而著名于世；第二个梯级卡霍夫卡水电站在去年建成。这两个水电站只利用了第聂伯河从基辅到黑海的水位差（一百公尺）中的一半。为了充分利用尚未利用的水力资源，苏联政府决定再在这条河上游建设四个大水电站。其中，发电能力为四十万瓩和三十五万瓩的克列门楚格和第聂伯罗捷尔任斯基水电站已经动工兴建，卡涅夫和基辅水电站的最后设计即将完成，并且将在明年开始建设。
    等第聂伯河的这四个新水电站建成以后，这条大河流经乌克兰境内的将近一千公里的这一段将满布着一系列的水电站和大水库。它们所生产的电力将使整个乌克兰的电力供应情况完全改观，第聂伯河的航运条件也将彻底改善，大吨位的轮船将可以从黑海直驶基辅城下。
