    工人云集　物资堆积
    苏联友谊铁路加紧施工
    据新华社16日讯据塔斯社报道：随着春天的到来，从苏联阿克斗卡站到中国新疆维吾尔自治区边境的“友谊铁路”线上，更加热闹起来了。一队队的建筑工人和一车车的物资不断地从俄罗斯联邦、乌克兰、白俄罗斯等地来到阿克斗卡车站。铁路上的全体建筑人员已经投入了热烈的社会主义竞赛。他们保证要在十月革命四十周年前夕提前完成今年规定的工作任务。
    目前，铁路的路基正在不断地向中国边境延伸。住宅和其他建筑正在加紧进行。在最近五个月中，就有三千平方公尺的住宅落成，并且住进了人。有三个商店和一个食堂已经开始营业了。
    桥梁工程队已经在坚捷克河岸上盖起了十六幢住宅。横跨坚捷克河的桥梁的建筑工程目前已经进入混凝土施工阶段。
    今年，在整个铁路线上将完成三百二十万公方的土方工程，修筑二百零六公里的路基，在约一百五十公里的路基上铺上铁轨。此外，还要建筑许多混凝土建筑物，铺设电讯线路，建筑总面积达九千平方公尺的住宅。
