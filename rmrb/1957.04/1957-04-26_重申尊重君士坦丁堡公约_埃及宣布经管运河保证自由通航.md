    重申尊重君士坦丁堡公约
    埃及宣布经管运河保证自由通航
    新华社开罗25日电　埃及政府在24日发表了关于苏伊士运河的未来经营问题的宣言。
    宣言重申尊重1888年君士坦丁堡公约的条款和精神，宣布运河要由埃及苏伊士运河管理局经营和管理，并且说，关于1888年公约和这个宣言产生的争论如果不能用其他办法解决，将提交国际法院。
    宣言说，埃及政府发表这个宣言是为了表示它要使苏伊士运河成为把世界各国联系起来并且为和平和繁荣的事业服务的有效的和适当的水道这种希望和决心。它宣布，这个宣言以及它所包含的义务构成一个国际文件。
    这个宣言已经在当天由埃及驻联合国代表交给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德。埃及外交部长法齐在给哈马舍尔德的信中，要求他把这个宣言作为国际文件向联合国秘书处登记。
    法齐的信说，这个宣言是埃及在1957年3月18日的备忘录中所提出的关于苏伊士运河的原则和它的管理上的安排的进一步的详细声明。
    埃及政府的宣言包括十点：一、重申公约，二、遵守公约和联合国宪章，三、运河的航行自由、通行税和发展，四、经营和管理，五、财政安排，六、运河法，七、有关运河法的歧视和申诉，八、赔偿和要求，九、关于公约和宣言产生的争端、意见分歧或争论，十、宣言的地位。
    宣言说，埃及政府决心在1888年君士坦丁堡公约的范围内，向所有国家提供并维持运河的自由无阻的航行。
    宣言说，通行税应继续按照埃及政府和苏伊士运河海运公司在1936年4月28日缔结的最后协定征收，而如果在任何十二个月内通行税的现行税率有任何提高，这种提高应限为1％；任何超过这个水平的提高将通过谈判来决定，如果不能达成协议，将通过仲裁来解决；通行税应当预先向苏伊士运河管理局授权的任何银行里的它的账户名下交付。
    苏伊士运河管理局将向埃及政府交付总收入的5％，作为使用费。
    苏伊士运河管理局将设立一个苏伊士运河资本和发展基金，应将总收入的25％交付这一基金。这一基金将保证苏伊士运河管理局可以得到足够的资源来满足发展和资本支出的需要，以便完成他们已经承担的并且充分决心完成的责任。
    宣言说，运河将由埃及的苏伊士运河管理局来经营和管理。同时埃及政府将欢迎和鼓励苏伊士运河当局同航运和贸易界的代表们进行合作。
    宣言的有关运河法的歧视和申诉的部分说，有关歧视或违犯运河法的申诉应设法由申诉一方提请苏伊士运河管理局解决。如果提交后还不能解决，可以由申诉一方或管理局作出决定而将这一案件提交一仲裁法庭；这一法庭由申诉一方所任命的代表一人、管理局所任命的代表一人以及由双方所共同挑选的第三人所组成。如有意见分歧，得经任何一方的申请而由国际法院院长挑选第三人。仲裁法庭的决定一经作出，对各方就有约束力。
    宣言说，同苏伊士运河海运公司国有化有关的赔偿和要求的问题，除非在有关各方之间达成协议，应按照既有国际惯例提交仲裁。
