Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, April 1st. Overseas Chinese residing abroad in Fujian Province are enthusiastically investing in the construction and expansion of factories, farms, and the establishment of cultural and educational undertakings in important towns and villages along the southern section of the Yingxia Railway.

The expansion project of the Xiamen Canned Food Factory under the Fujian Overseas Chinese Investment Company in Xiamen is currently underway. Once the expansion project is completed and put into production in June this year, the annual output will increase fourfold compared to before the expansion. According to materials from the Fujian Provincial Overseas Chinese Investment Guidance Committee, overseas Chinese will invest nearly 40 million yuan in Xiamen and Zhangzhou to build 23 factories of various sizes for small hardware, rubber, glass, spices, rope netting, and other industries.

The tractor station being built by overseas Chinese in the Pinning District of Longxi County has already received two tractors. This county and Haicheng County are close to the railway, and the farms, reclamation ranches, and aquaculture farms that overseas Chinese originally invested in there will all increase their investment. The Longxi Overseas Chinese Farm will increase its capital to 300,000 yuan, and the Punan Reclamation Ranch will increase its capital to 500,000 yuan. Both farms have already received funds invested by overseas Chinese.

Overseas Chinese will also establish cultural and educational undertakings in Xiamen, Zhangzhou, and nearby areas. Projects currently under preparation include the Zhangzhou Overseas Chinese Building, the Shima Theater, the Tong'an Theater, the Longxi Overseas Chinese Hospital, and the Liuchuan Obstetrics Hospital. The Zhangzhou Qiaoxiang Theater and the Jiaowei Theater, which have already been built, are now officially open for business.

    建设鹰厦路南段城乡
    国外华侨积极投资
    新华社福州1日电　福建省旅居国外的华侨，踊跃投资在鹰厦铁路南段重要城镇和乡村新建、扩建工厂、农场和兴办文化教育事业。
    厦门市福建华侨投资公司厦门罐头厂的扩建工程，目前正在积极进行。扩建工程到今年6月完工投入生产后，年产量可比扩建前增加四倍。据福建省华侨投资辅导委员会的材料，华侨将在厦门和漳州两市投资新建小五金、橡胶、玻璃、香料、绳网等二十三个大小工厂，投资总额将近四千万元。
    华侨在龙溪县平宁区筹建的拖拉机站，现在已经运来了两台拖拉机。这个县和海澄县接近铁路，原来华侨在那里投资建设的农场、垦牧场、养殖场等，都将增加投资额。龙溪华侨农场将增资到三十万元，浦南垦牧场将增资到五十万元。现在这两个场已经陆续收到了华侨投入的资金。
    华侨还将在厦门、漳州两市和附近地区兴办文化教育事业。目前正在筹建中的有漳州市华侨大厦、石码戏院、同安戏院、龙溪华侨医院和流传产科医院等。已经建成的漳州侨芗戏院和角尾戏院，现在已经正式营业。
