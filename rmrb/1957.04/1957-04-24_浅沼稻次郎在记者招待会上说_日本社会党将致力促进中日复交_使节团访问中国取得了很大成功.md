Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd: Asanuma Inejirō, head of the goodwill delegation to China from the Socialist Party of Japan, stated at a press conference in Beijing this morning to Chinese and foreign journalists that the Socialist Party of Japan will utilize the achievements of this delegation's visit to China to promote the restoration of diplomatic relations between the Japanese government and China.

Asanuma Inejirō said that the Socialist Party will also launch a nationwide national movement and strive to establish a Socialist Party government. He believes that the delegation's visit to China has achieved great success, which will help promote the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations and world peace. Asanuma Inejirō also said that the results of the delegation's visit to China are embodied in the joint statement he issued with Zhang Xiruo.

Asanuma Inejirō and other members of the delegation also stated at the press conference that the Socialist Party, as a major opposition party with more than one-third of the seats in the Diet, will make demands on the government by utilizing the achievements of the delegation's visit to China, strive for cooperation from the Conservative Party, and make efforts in the Diet's Foreign Affairs Committee to promote the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations.

When answering a question, Asanuma Inejirō reiterated the Socialist Party's position, which is that "Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, and we advocate that the Chinese government should solve their own problems."

When a reporter asked about the possibility of forming a Socialist Party government, Asanuma Inejirō replied that the Socialist Party received more than one-third of the votes in the election last July, close to the number of votes obtained by the Conservative Party. "We think we will make up for this small difference in the next election."

Regarding the national movement to restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, Katsumada Seiichi, chairman of the Special Committee for Restoring Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations of the Socialist Party of Japan, said that the joint statement "has clearly defined the important principles related to the issues between the two countries," and this achievement will undoubtedly further promote the development of the national movement to restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. Now, this movement can start with trade, culture, and technological cooperation first. As for the movement to strive for the conclusion of a Sino-Japanese peace treaty, it is still relatively difficult and will take some time. The Socialist Party will also strive to make the Japanese people realize that if unequal treaties are to be abolished, the normalization of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations must first be realized.

Sata Tadataka, Director of the International Bureau of the Socialist Party, said at the meeting that after the Socialist Party comes to power, "we will naturally act in accordance with the letter and spirit of the joint statement and devote ourselves to the normalization of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations."

When asked about Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi's upcoming visit to Southeast Asia and the United States, Asanuma Inejirō said that Nobusuke Kishi may discuss the China issue with the leaders of Southeast Asian countries. "I believe that if Nobusuke Kishi discusses with them in accordance with the spirit of the joint statement, he will be enlightened and thus gradually approach our ideas."

Regarding Sino-Japanese trade issues, Asanuma Inejirō said that the Socialist Party has made strong demands on the Japanese government and will continue to demand the cancellation of the decision requiring Chinese business representatives to provide fingerprints.

Asanuma Inejirō also mentioned at today's press conference that the Socialist Party will strive to expand the content of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement and promote the dispatch of a 40-member agricultural delegation to visit China. The Japanese people, including some government officials, hope to invite Li Dequan to visit Japan, and if the Ministry of Foreign Affairs agrees, this visit can be realized.

    浅沼稻次郎在记者招待会上说
    日本社会党将致力促进中日复交
    使节团访问中国取得了很大成功
    新华社23日讯　日本社会党访华亲善使节团团长浅沼稻次郎今天上午在北京向中外记者发表谈话说，日本社会党将运用使节团这次访华取得的成果，来推动日本政府同中国恢复外交关系。
    浅沼稻次郎说，社会党还将发起全国性的国民运动和争取建立社会党的政府。他认为使节团的访问中国取得了一个大成功，它将有助于促进中日邦交的正常化和世界和平。浅沼稻次郎并说，使节团访华的成果已体现在他同张奚若发表的共同声明中。
    浅沼稻次郎和其他的团员还在记者招待会上表示，社会党作为一个在国会中拥有三分之一以上席位的主要反对党，将要通过运用使节团访华成果来向政府提出要求，争取保守党的合作和在国会外务委员会中进行努力，以便促进中日邦交正常化。
    浅沼稻次郎在回答一个问题时重申社会党的立场，就是“台湾是中国的不可分割的部分，我们主张由中国政府去解决他们自己的问题”。
    有记者问到组织社会党政府的可能性，浅沼稻次郎回答说，社会党在去年7月的选举中得到了三分之一以上的选票，接近于保守党所得的票数。“我们想我们将会在下次选举中弥补起这个微小的差额”。
    关于恢复日中邦交国民运动，日本社会党恢复日中邦交特别委员会委员长胜间田清一说，共同声明
  “已经明白确定了有关两国问题的重要原则”，这个成果无疑将进一步促进恢复日中邦交国民运动的发展。现在，这个运动可以首先从贸易、文化和技术合作开始。至于争取缔结中日和约的运动，现在还比较困难，并且需要一些时间。社会党并且将努力使日本人民认识到，如果要废除不平等条约，首先就必须实现中日邦交正常化。
    社会党国际局长佐多忠隆在会上说，在社会党执政以后，“我们自然将按照共同声明的文字和精神行事，并且致力于中日邦交的正常化。”
    在问到日本首相岸信介即将访问东南亚和美国这个问题时，浅沼稻次郎说，岸信介可能会和东南亚国家的领袖讨论中国问题，“我相信，如果岸信介同他们根据共同声明的精神来进行讨论，他将会受到启发，并且因而逐渐接近我们的想法。”
    关于中日贸易问题，浅沼稻次郎说，社会党已经向日本政府提出强硬要求，并且将继续要求取消中国商务代表按指印的决定。
    浅沼稻次郎在今天的记者招待会上还谈到，社会党将努力争取扩大第四次日中贸易协定的内容，促成派遣一个由四十人组成的农学代表团访问中国。日本人民，包括某些政府人士都希望邀请李德全访问日本，如果得到外务省的同意，这次访问就可以实现。
