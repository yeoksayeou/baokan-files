Xinhua News Agency, April 18th: The CCP Beijing Municipal Committee recently held a propaganda work conference to earnestly discuss Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, and his speech at the National Propaganda Work Conference. The conference began on March 25th and lasted for eight days. The Party and non-Party cadres participating in the conference, combined with the situation of ideological work in Beijing, launched a heated discussion. Sixty-one people spoke at the general meeting.

More than 1,400 Party and non-Party cadres from Beijing's industrial and mining construction enterprises, CCP district committees, government agencies, mass organizations, schools, arts, health, sports, news and publishing sectors participated in the conference, including more than 290 people from various democratic parties and non-party figures.

Correctly Implementing the Central Guidelines Makes It Easy to Solve Contradictions Among the People

The cadres participating in the conference felt that they had gained a lot and their direction was clearer after this discussion. They unanimously believed that Chairman Mao's speech on the correct handling of contradictions among the people put forward extremely important guidelines for adjusting the relationship of contradictions among the people and was a major development of Marxism-Leninism theory in China's new historical conditions. Some cadres said in the discussion: In the past, they believed that there could be no contradictions among the people, but now they realize that contradictions do exist among the people; the methods for handling contradictions among the people must be distinguished in principle from the methods for handling contradictions between ourselves and the enemy. The Party Committee Propaganda Members of the Beijing Tram Company, Beijing Automobile Transportation Company, and Beijing Waterworks Company felt before the meeting that there were many problems in the factory, such as the existence of certain uncoordinated phenomena between leaders and the masses, and felt that ideological work was becoming increasingly difficult; after listening to Chairman Mao's report, they realized the solution to the contradiction among the people and strengthened their confidence in their work. They believed that the current problems in the factory, such as the relationship between the Party and the masses, and the relationship between leaders and the masses, could be solved if the central government's guidelines for handling contradictions among the people were correctly implemented, bureaucracy was overcome, and ideological work was strengthened. Some also examined some of the past crude practices in dealing with contradictions among the people at the meeting.

Everyone believed that since the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" was put forward, Beijing's academic and literary circles have become more active. Some universities have begun to organize academic debates on the history of philosophy and history; in the field of opera, more than 1,000 traditional repertoires have been unearthed, and more than 100 repertoires that have not been performed for a long time have been staged. Some old artists, such as Xiao Cuihua, have returned to the stage. The literary world has launched a discussion on socialist realism, and the themes of creation have also become broader than in the past. After this meeting, especially after hearing the transmission of Chairman Mao's speech, many people received a profound education in their thinking, eliminated some unnecessary ideological concerns, further understood the correctness of the "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" policy, and were full of confidence in the future prosperity of science and art.

Contact Reality, Contact Workers, Peasants, and Intellectuals, and Demand Ideological Transformation

The cadres participating in the conference wholeheartedly supported Chairman Mao's instruction on "educators must be educated." Many Party committee leaders from schools, factories, mines, and hospitals said in their speeches that uniting and transforming intellectuals is a long-term and arduous task, and Party organizations must work hard to help them establish a Marxist-Leninist worldview. Many Party and non-Party intellectuals expressed their eager desire to contact reality, contact workers and peasants, and better carry out ideological transformation in their speeches. Chen Yuan, president of Beijing Normal University, said in his speech at the conference: "We are studying books all day long, which is not enough; Chairman Mao proposed that intellectuals should go to the countryside and factories to learn from the masses, this method is too good! Because only in this way can the knowledge of intellectuals be practical and useful knowledge."

He went on to say: "Chairman Mao often 'seeks within himself' when talking about contradictions among the people, and he must first demand of himself, that is, when some things are not done well or do not work, he must ask himself if he is at fault. I think that in terms of intellectuals themselves, it seems that they should also use the spirit grasped by the Party, and should also have a 'self-seeking' spirit, and should first demand of themselves." Young writer Wang Meng talked about his experience in response to the discussion of his works in the literary world during this period. He believes that most of the opinions in this discussion are correct, which is really "better than reading for ten years," and puts forward new topics for his ideological transformation. To transform himself, he must go deep into the workers and peasants. Some university professors also cited some personal experiences and observations to illustrate the importance of contacting reality and conducting investigations and research for understanding the Party's policies, improving teaching content, and transforming ideology.

Can Only Persuade, Not Subdue, and Must Strengthen Political and Ideological Work

The cadres participating in the conference had a clearer understanding of the importance of ideological work. Everyone believed that since last year, the mainstream of mass thought has been healthy. However, due to certain one-sidedness in propaganda work, such as excessive publicity of the improvement of living standards and neglect of the education of the tradition of hard work; coupled with the relaxation of ideological work for a time, unhealthy thoughts among the masses, such as the pursuit of personal fame and fortune and neglect of political tendencies, have grown to some extent. Everyone realized that: in the future, contradictions among the people will become more prominent, and the task of ideological work will be more arduous. For the problems among the people, only the method of persuasion can be adopted, not subjugation, so it is necessary to effectively strengthen the Party's political and ideological work, and the first secretary of the Party committee must personally do ideological work. Some non-Party people suggested that the strength of non-Party people can be mobilized to assist the Party in carrying out ideological education.

Everyone felt that the way of holding meetings with both Party members and non-Party members was very good, believing that it could not only gather wisdom and benefit, but also eliminate estrangement and close the relationship between the Party and the masses. Xu Mengxiong, a professor in the Journalism Department of Renmin University of China, was very touched by attending this meeting. He said: "In the past, I didn't know what the Party was doing. Now, attending this meeting is like seeing an exhibition. I deeply realize that the Party is working for the welfare of the people." Many Party and non-Party cadres suggested that this way of holding meetings should be promoted.

In group discussions and general speeches, the spirit of letting a hundred schools of thought contend was fully reflected, and everyone spoke freely, raising many questions and different opinions.

Don't Be Afraid of "Releasing" Poisonous Weeds

Criticism Should Be Gentle and Soft

Regarding how to specifically implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," everyone agreed to "letting," believing that Beijing's current "letting" is not enough.

Some people still have concerns about "letting," fearing that "releasing" poisonous weeds will poison the masses, fearing that it will cause ideological confusion; fearing that it will not be easy to lead, and so on. Some people also regard works that are not poisonous weeds as poisonous weeds and oppose them, such as some people even thinking that "Midnight Song" and "Street Angel" are also poisonous weeds. Some people are also worried that if they "release" idealism, they will be attacked. They believe that "letting" should not be criticized, and criticism hinders "letting." Most people believe that "letting a hundred schools of thought contend," "contending" requires contention, and there is criticism. However, criticism must be persuasive and use gentle and soft methods. Dogmatic and crude criticism hinders "letting."

Artists and Actors Criticize Cultural Departments

At the meeting, some people exposed some shortcomings in their work and put forward some opinions on the leading departments of cultural work. Woodcarver Gao Rongli reflected that the artist Lu Jingda made a bottle with a scene of "Night Battle of Ma Chao" painted on it, but was criticized by the leader, saying that "the country's policy is peace, and war themes should not be used." Ivory carver Yang Shihui said: "We ivory carvers are very distressed. Old things are not right, and new things are not good either. Making big things, it is said that it was for the emperor to appreciate in the past; making small things, it is said that it was the strange things that the scholar-officials played with in the past. Making old ladies, they are ridiculed as belly-holding ladies; making dragons and phoenixes, they are said to be feudal; making Buddha statues, they are said to be superstitious. What should we do? Few people point out a clear direction." Cao Baolu from the quyi circle and Peking Opera actor Li Wanchun reflected that some leading departments in the troupe work "emphasize the public and neglect the private, emphasize the big and neglect the small." More subsidies are given to state-owned troupes, and less subsidies are given to private professional troupes; the good actors of private professional troupes are dug away.

Party Members and Non-Party Intellectuals Should Not "Respect Each Other and Stay Away"

Some higher education groups believed in the discussion that the relationship between the Party and intellectuals in higher education institutions is basically good and has improved compared with the past; however, there are still problems, and there is still a gap between some Party members and non-Party intellectuals. On the surface, they are polite, but they do not meet enough in their thinking, and they "respect each other and stay away." They suggested that in the future, they should have closer contact through various ways to improve the relationship between the Party and intellectuals. Some non-Party people criticized some units for not giving enough play to democracy and not consulting them enough on major issues. Some cadres of democratic parties proposed that the role of democratic parties in some higher education institutions is still not fully played.

During the meeting, the Secretariat of the CCP Beijing Municipal Committee also held five symposiums with 80 Party and non-Party cadres attending, including university presidents and professors, primary and secondary school principals and teachers, literary and art workers, and medical and sports circles, to solicit their opinions on various aspects of work.

Regarding the above-mentioned different opinions and problems, the Municipal Party Committee is discussing and studying them and preparing to make a summary of the conference.

    中共北京市委召开宣传工作会议
    讨论正确处理人民内部矛盾问题
    新华社18日讯　中共北京市委最近召开宣传工作会议，认真讨论了毛主席在最高国务会议上作的关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的讲话和在全国宣传工作会议上的讲话。这次会议是在3月25日开始举行的，一共开了八天。参加会议的党内外干部，结合北京市思想工作的情况，展开了热烈的讨论。有六十一人在大会上发了言。
    参加会议的有北京市工矿建筑企业、中共各区区委、机关、群众团体、学校、文艺、卫生、体育、新闻出版等方面的党内外干部一千四百多人，其中包括各民主党派和无党派人士二百九十多人。正确贯彻执行中央方针人民内部矛盾不难解决
    参加会议的干部经过这次讨论，感到收获很大，方向更加明确了。他们一致认为，毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的讲话提出了调整人民内部矛盾关系的极为重要的方针，是马克思列宁主义理论在中国新的历史条件下的重大发展。有些干部在讨论中说：过去认为人民内部不能存在矛盾，现在认识到人民内部是存在矛盾的；处理人民内部矛盾的方法，必须从原则上同处理敌我矛盾的方法区别开来。北京市电车公司、北京市汽车运输公司、北京市自来水公司的党委宣传委员在会前就感到厂里的问题很多，如领导和群众间存在着某些不协调现象，觉得思想工作越来越不好作了；听过毛主席的报告以后，认识到解决人民内部矛盾的办法，加强了工作的信心。他们认为，目前厂内存在的党群关系、领导和群众关系等方面的问题，如果能正确贯彻中央处理人民内部矛盾的方针，克服官僚主义，加强思想工作，问题是可以解决的。有的还在会上检查了过去在处理人民内部矛盾问题上的一些粗暴作法。
    大家认为，自从“百花齐放，百家争鸣”这个方针提出后，北京市学术界、文艺界更加活跃起来了。有的大学开始组织哲学史、历史的学术争论；在戏曲方面挖掘了一千多出传统剧目，上演了一百多出久不演出的剧目。有些老艺人如小翠花又重登舞台。文学界展开了关于社会主义现实主义的讨论，在创作题材上也比过去广泛了。经过这次会议，尤其是听了传达毛主席的讲话后，很多人思想上受到一次深刻的教育，消除了一些不必要的思想顾虑，进一步理解了“百花齐放、百家争鸣”方针的正确性，对今后科学文艺的繁荣充满了信心。
  接触实际，接触工农知识分子要求改造思想
    参加会议的干部衷心地拥护毛主席提出的关于“教育者必须受教育”的指示。不少学校、厂矿、医院党委负责人在发言中说：团结改造知识分子是一件长期艰巨的工作，党组织要努力帮助他们树立起马克思列宁主义的世界观。很多党内外知识分子在发言中表现了他们迫切要求接触实际、接触工农，更好地进行思想改造的心情。北京师范大学校长陈垣在大会发言时说：“我们整天在书本上学习，这是很不够的；毛主席提出知识分子要下乡下厂，去向群众学习，这个办法太好了！因为只有这样，知识分子的知识才能是实际有用的知识。”
    他接着说：“毛主席在讲人民内部矛盾的时候，常常‘反求诸己’，要首先要求自己，就是说，遇到有些事情办不好或者行不通的时候，就要反问自己是否有错误。我觉得在知识分子本身来说，似乎也应当用党所掌握的精神，也要有
  ‘反求诸己’的精神，应当首先要求自己。”青年作家王蒙针对这一时期文艺界对他作品的讨论，谈到自己的体会。他认为这次讨论中，绝大多数的意见是正确的，真是“胜读十年书”，对自己的思想改造提出了新的课题，要改造自己就必须要深入到工农群众中去。有些大学教授还列举了一些亲身的经历和见闻，说明接触实际进行调查研究对于了解党的政策、改进教学内容以及改造思想的重要意义。
  只能说服，不能压服必须加强政治思想工作
    对于思想工作的重要性，参加会议的干部有了更加明确的认识。大家认为去年以来，群众思想主流是健康的。但是由于在宣传工作上曾经存在某些片面性，如过分宣传生活的改善，忽视了艰苦奋斗传统的教育；加上思想工作一度放松，群众中不健康的思想如追求个人名利、忽视政治倾向等有某些程度的滋长。大家认识到：今后人民内部的矛盾更加突出了，思想工作的任务是更加艰巨了。对于人民内部的问题，只能采取说服的办法而不能压服，因此，必须要切实加强党的政治思想工作，党委第一书记必须要亲自动手做思想工作。有的党外人士提出建议说，可以动员党外人士的力量协助党进行思想教育工作。
    大家对这次党内外一起开会的方式感觉很好，认为这样不但可以集思广益，而且可以消除隔阂，密切党群关系。中国人民大学新闻系教授许梦熊对参加这次会很受感动，他说：“过去我不知道党内到底做些什么事，现在参加这个会，好像看了一次展览会一样，深刻认识到党是在为人民谋福利。”不少党内外干部建议把这种开会方式加以推广。
    在小组讨论和大会发言中，充分体现了百家争鸣的精神，大家畅所欲言，提出了许多问题和不同的意见。
    不要怕“放”出毒草
    批评要和风细雨
    对于怎样具体贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”方针这个问题，大家赞成“放”，认为目前北京“放”得不够。
    有些人对“放”还有顾虑，怕“放”出毒草使群众中毒，怕造成思想混乱；怕不好领导等等。也有的人把不是毒草的作品也当成毒草而加以反对，如有人甚至认为“夜半歌声”、“马路天使”也是毒草。也有些人还顾虑自己“放”了唯心主义以后，遭到打击。他们认为“放”就不要批评，批评是妨碍着“放”的。多数人的意见认为，“百家争鸣”，“鸣”就要争，就有批评。但是，批评要有说服力，要用和风细雨的方法。教条主义的粗暴的批评是妨碍着“放”的。
        艺人演员对文化部门提出批评
    会上有些人揭发了一些工作中的缺点，对文化工作的领导部门提出了一些意见。木雕艺人高荣礼反映，艺人陆竟达作了一个瓶，上面画了“夜战马超”的场景，结果受到领导的批评，说“国家的政策是和平，不应该弄战争的题材”。牙刻艺人杨士惠说：“我们搞象牙雕刻的人十分苦恼，搞老的不对，搞新的也不行。搞大件吧，说那是过去供皇帝欣赏的；作小的吧，说那是士大夫过去所玩弄的奇特的东西。作旧的仕女吧，被人讽刺为捧腹仕女；作龙凤吧，说是封建的；作佛像吧，说是迷信的。到底应该如何搞呢？很少人指出明确的方向。”曲艺界曹宝禄和京剧演员李万春反映有些领导部门在剧团工作上“重公轻私、重大轻小”。对国营剧团补助多，民间职业剧团补助少；把民间职业剧团的好角都挖走了。
    党员和党外知识分子不要互相“敬而远之”
    有些高等学校小组在讨论中认为，目前在高等学校中党和知识分子的关系基本上是好的，比过去有进步；但是还存在问题，一些党员和党外知识分子之间还有隔膜，表面上客客气气，思想见面不够，互相“敬而远之”。他们建议以后通过多种方式密切接触，改善党和知识分子的关系。有些党外人士批评有些单位党组织发扬民主不够，重大事情和他们商量不够。有的民主党派的干部提出目前有一些高等学校中民主党派的作用发挥得也还不够。
    会议期间，中共北京市委书记处还分别召开了有党内外干部八十人参加的高等学校校长、教授，中小学校长、教师，文艺工作者和医务界、体育界的五次座谈会，征求了他们对各方面工作的意见。
    对于上述不同的意见和问题，市委正在讨论研究，准备作大会总结。
