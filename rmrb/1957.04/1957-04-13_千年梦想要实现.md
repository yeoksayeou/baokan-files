Millennial Dream to be Realized
    Hong Ya
    For thousands of years, people have been praising the merits of Yu chiseling Longmen and splitting砥柱 (Dǐzhù, a rock in the Yellow River). In fact, these legends only reflect people's desire to open up the Three Gate's perilous passage and conquer the Yellow River.
    In the past, the Sanmenxia, like the entire Yellow River, brought many disasters to the people. The Yellow River's water formed fierce rapids as it flowed through Sanmenxia, and countless ships and boatmen were shattered here. Before the completion of the Longhai Railway, Sanmenxia was an important transportation route between east and west. Many boatmen gathered at the Yu Wang Temple, built in the Tang Dynasty, to pray for the protection of the gods before passing through Sanmenxia. The temple was filled with incense all day long, and the courtyard was littered with firecrackers. But what protection did Yu Wang ultimately give the people? What omens of disaster and peace did the iron ducks, worn smooth by countless hands in the temple, actually reveal?
    Now, the wishes of the people in the Yellow River basin are beginning to be realized. The Sanmenxia water control project, an important project to control the Yellow River's water hazards and develop the Yellow River's water resources, started construction today.
    On Sanmen Island, drilling rigs have already been set up. A vertical shaft more than 100 meters deep has been driven from Guimen Island, passing under the Shenmen River and extending into Shenmen Island. Three steel cable bridges spanning Sanmen Island connect Sanmen with both banks. Huge machinery is distributed along the river valley. An iron bridge that will span the lower reaches of Sanmenxia has also begun construction. The sound of cannons opening the mountain shakes the valley. From the construction site tents on the mountainside on both sides of the river, the laughter of workers from Guanting, Douhe Reservoir, Shizitan, and Fengman Hydropower Station is constantly heard. On the highway from the Sanmenxia construction site to Huixing Town, buses and trucks loaded with equipment shuttle back and forth. The railway connecting Huixing Station on the Longhai Railway to Sanmenxia, about twenty kilometers long, has already had a long section of track laid. The sound of train whistles begins to echo in this quiet valley.
    Several red flags fluttering in the wind are diagonally inserted from Renmen Island to the right bank. This is the dam axis of the great Sanmenxia water control project.
    The Sanmenxia water control project is located in the lower section of the middle reaches of the Yellow River. Its south bank is Shanxian County in Henan Province, and its north bank is Pinglu County in Shanxi Province. The dam built here will control the runoff from 92% of the Yellow River basin's area.
    The Sanmenxia water control project's dam is a reinforced concrete gravity dam. This project is situated on a very solid rock. The geological term for this rock is "diorite porphyry." People only need to think about how it has not been damaged by floods for tens of thousands of years to know how hard it is.
    The height of the Sanmenxia water control project's dam is 120 meters, and the length of the dam crest is about one kilometer. When this gravity dam, which supports the sky and connects to the white clouds, is completed, a majestic "water conservancy city" will appear on the Yellow River, 3,800 kilometers from the source and about 1,000 kilometers from the estuary.
    The reason I call the Sanmenxia water control project a "water conservancy city" is that this gravity dam also includes a spillway dam, non-overflow dams on the left and right banks, and a hydroelectric power station.
    Upstream of this group of dams is a reservoir that can store 64.7 billion cubic meters of water and has an area much larger than Taihu Lake. It will be a huge inland sea on the plateau, a beautiful artificial lake, a fish farm with abundant fish, and a seaport for the people of Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Henan.
    The Sanmenxia Reservoir is quite deep, but the waves are small, making it suitable for navigation. In the five years after the reservoir is completed, the passenger transport volume can reach 140,000 people, and ships with a load of 200 tons can also navigate without hindrance. In the future, with the downstream Balihutong Hydropower Station and Taohuayu barrage and other cascade development, ships will be able to sail from the estuary to Xi'an, creating a new era in the history of Yellow River shipping.
    Plans also call for opening up the Lingbaojian River and Shanxianjian River as natural breeding areas for fish, and fish farms will be built. This huge reservoir will become a free world for carp, crucian carp, and white sturgeon.
    The future reservoir is also a beautiful garden. Residents living in the newly built Huixing Town, Zhangzuo Town, Wuyi Village, and other new towns and villages will have a beautiful living environment.
    The happiness that the Sanmenxia Reservoir brings to the people is far more than these. More importantly, because the reservoir can hold most of the Yellow River's water, if a particularly large flood occurs once in a thousand years, the flow rate can be reduced from 35,000 cubic meters per second to 6,000 cubic meters per second, so that the downstream can safely discharge the water. If a particularly large flood occurs in the main stream and tributaries of the Yellow River from the dam downstream to the Jinghan Railway Yellow River Iron Bridge, the gates can be closed for a few days without releasing water until the downstream flood passes. In this way, the lives and property of the people in the lower reaches of the Yellow River will be protected. After the management of the tributaries Yi River, Luo River, and Qin River is completed, the Yellow River's water hazards will completely become a historical term.
    In the past, people's hope for the Yellow River was only to ask it to flow peacefully into the sea and not come out to harm people. However, the Sanmenxia Reservoir will also use the water that it holds back to irrigate 40 million mu of farmland in Henan, Shandong, and Hebei provinces, so that the country and farmers can increase grain production by 4 billion jin per year. At the same time, animal husbandry in Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Henan provinces will also be greatly developed.
    The Yellow River is a treasure trove for the people of our country. Not only is it rich in water resources, but it also contains countless minerals in the vicinity. The key to fully developing these minerals is the hydroelectric power station in the Sanmenxia water control project.
    This hydroelectric power station is currently the largest in our country. If it is connected with thermal power generation in Xi'an, Taiyuan, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Kaifeng, and other places, it will form the largest power grid in central China. The plan is to send this cheap electricity, which can be bought for only a few cents per kilowatt-hour, to industrial bases such as aluminum smelting, magnesium smelting, and steel smelting.
    Great Sanmenxia water control project, today we want to praise you, saying that you are the lifeblood of agriculture here, the mother of industry, the source of shipping, and the guarantee of people's happiness.
    Great Sanmenxia water control project, today we want to wish you to put the Yellow River's flood into your pocket as soon as possible; to hear the sound of your completion ceremony as soon as possible; to see you radiate electricity as soon as possible, like the sun on the ground.
    Great Yellow River, we also wish you to change your irritable character as soon as possible, to turn from a harmful river into a beneficial river, and let people sing together: Yellow River, you are my lovely hometown! (Attached picture)

    千年梦想要实现
    洪崖
    千百年来，人们一直传颂着禹凿龙门、劈砥柱的功绩。实际上，这些传说只是反映了人们渴望打通三门天险，征服黄河的愿望。
    过去，三门峡像整个黄河一样，曾经带给人民不少灾难。黄河水流经三门峡形成了凶猛的激流，无数船只和船民都在这里粉身碎骨。在陇海铁路修通以前，三门峡是东西交通要道。众多的船民在过三门峡以前，都聚集到唐代修建的禹王庙里去祈求神灵保佑。庙里终日香烟缭绕，庭院中落满爆竹。但是，禹王究竟给了人们什么保佑？庙中被人摸得发光的铁鸭子，究竟显示过什么灾祸与平安的预兆？
    现在，黄河流域人民的愿望开始实现，根治黄河水害、开发黄河水利的重要工程——三门峡水利枢纽工程今天就开工了。
    三门岛上，钻探机群已经架起来了。一个一百多公尺深的竖井已经从鬼门岛打进去，通过神门河的下面，伸进神门岛。横跨在三门岛上的三座钢丝缆桥把三门和两岸连成一片。庞大的机群分布在河谷的沿岸。一座将横跨在三门峡下游的铁桥也已经动工。开山炮声震撼山谷。两岸山腰的工地帐篷里，不时地传出来自官厅、陡河水库、狮子滩、丰满水电站的工人们的欢笑。由三门峡工地到会兴镇的公路上，公共汽车和满载器材的卡车来回奔驰。从陇海路上的会兴车站连接三门峡的长约二十公里的铁路，铁轨已经铺好很长的一段。火车的汽笛声开始回荡在这里的平静的山谷里。
    数面迎风招展的红旗由人门岛斜插到右岸。这里就是伟大的三门峡水利枢纽的坝轴线。
    三门峡水利枢纽在黄河中游的下段。它的南岸是河南省的陕县，北岸是山西省的平陆县。在这里筑起的大坝，将把黄河流域92％的面积的来水控制起来。
    三门峡水利枢纽工程的拦河坝，是钢筋混凝土的重力坝。这座工程被安排在一块十分坚固的岩石上。这块岩石地质学上的名词叫做
  “闪长玢岩”。人们只要想想它在多少万年以来一直没有被洪水冲击坏，就可以知道它是多么坚硬。
    三门峡水利枢纽的拦河坝的高度有一百二十公尺，坝顶长度约一公里。当这座拱托天空、衔接白云的重力坝建成以后，在上距河源三千八百公里，下离海口约一千公里的黄河上，就将出现一座巍峨的“水利城”。
    我所以称三门峡水利枢纽为“水利城”，是因为这座重力坝，还包括着溢流坝与左右两岸的非溢流坝以及一个水电站。
    在这群水坝的上游，就是能蓄水六百四十七亿公方、面积比太湖还要大得多的水库。它将是高原上巨大的内海，美丽的人工湖泊，鱼类繁多的鱼场，晋、陕、豫人民的海港。
    三门峡水库是相当深的，但波浪很小，适合航运。在水库建成后的五年中，客运量可达十四万人，载重二百吨的船只也可航行无阻。将来再配合下游的八里胡同水电站和桃花峪壅水坝等梯级开发，轮船就可以从海口驶达西安，开创黄河航运史上的新纪元。
    计划中还要开辟灵宝涧河、陕县涧河，作为鱼类自然繁殖区，并将修建育鱼场。这个巨大水库将成为鲤鱼、鲫鱼、白色鲟鱼的自由世界。
    未来的水库也是一座秀丽的花园。住在附近新建的会兴镇、张座镇、吴圩村等新型市镇的居民，将得到一个美丽的生活环境。
      三门峡水库带给人民的幸福，远不止这些。更主要的是，由于水库能装进黄河大部分的水，黄河如果发生千年一遇的特大洪水，流量也可以由三万五千秒公方减至六千秒公方，使下游能够安全排泄。假如大坝以下到京汉铁路黄河铁桥一段的黄河干流和支流出现特大洪水，那就可以把闸门关起来几天不放水，等下游洪水过去后再开闸。这样，黄河下游地区人民的生命财产就有了保障。等支流伊河、洛河、沁河的治理再完成以后，黄河水害就完全成为历史名词了。
    过去人们对黄河的希望，不过是要求它平平安安地流到海里去，不要出来害人。然而，三门峡水库却还要将拦起来的水用来灌溉河南、山东、河北三省的四千万亩农田，使国家与农民每年能够增产四十亿斤粮食。同时，山西、陕西、河南三省的畜牧业也将因此得到很大发展。
    黄河是我国人民的宝库，不但水利资源丰富，而且在附近蕴藏着无数的矿产。要充分开发这些矿产的一把钥匙，就是三门峡水利枢纽工程中的水电站。
    这座水电站是我国目前最大的水电站。如果它同西安、太原、郑州、洛阳、开封等地的火力发电联系起来，就将构成我国中部的一个最大的电力网。计划中要把这些只用几毫钱就能买到一度的廉价电力，送到制铝、炼镁、炼钢等工业基地去。
    伟大的三门峡水利枢纽工程，今天我们要歌颂你，说你是这里的农业的命脉，工业的母亲，航运的源泉，人民幸福的保证。
    伟大的三门峡水利枢纽，今天我们要预祝你早日把黄河的洪水装进你的口袋；早日听到你落成典礼的炮声；早日看到你电光四射，像是地上的太阳。
    伟大的黄河，我们也预祝你早日改变你暴躁的性格，早日由害河变成利河，让人们一齐欢唱：黄河，你是我可爱的家乡！（附图片）
    黄河的三门峡水利枢纽工程，今日正式开工了。这是三门峡全景。
