Xinhua News Agency, London, April 1st. The reasons for Salisbury's resignation are much deeper than the Cyprus issue. His decision to withdraw from the government reflects the increasingly serious political crisis within the Conservative Party and its internal divisions.

Labour MP Robens said in Blyth last weekend that Salisbury's resignation had brought "a major split in the Conservative leadership to a critical juncture." He said it was ironic that Salisbury, who pushed aside Butler and recommended Macmillan, now says he can no longer work with Mr. Macmillan.

He pointed out that the current government has now been discredited, so if Macmillan is to fulfill his responsibility to the country, he should hold a new general election.

Another Labour MP, Zilliacus, said on Sunday that Salisbury's resignation "shows the deep crisis of the government. This crisis is incurable and will deepen until it splits the Conservatives or forces them to announce a general election, or both. The difficulty is that the Conservatives' general method of healing wounds is fifty years out of date and will no longer work, while the bloody methods advocated by the 'diehards' in the Conservative Party are a hundred years out of date and are enough to invite disaster."

Nicholas Ridley, the Conservative Party candidate for Blyth, said that Salisbury's resignation was "special and unexpected." He said: "It is regrettable that the ship of state should run aground because of a recalcitrant bishop."

### 保举人不肯同被保举人共事  英国保守党内讧到了紧急关头

    保举人不肯同被保举人共事
    英国保守党内讧到了紧急关头
    新华社伦敦1日电　索耳兹伯里辞职的原因要比塞浦路斯问题深刻得多。他的决定退出政府，反映了保守党的政治危机和党内分歧已经愈来愈严重。
    工党议员罗本斯上周末在布莱思说，索耳兹伯里的辞职使得“保守党领导中的重大分裂发展到了危急的关头”。他说，推开了巴特勒而保举了麦克米伦的索耳兹伯里现在说，他不能再同麦克米伦先生共事了，这真是一个讽刺。
    他指出，目前这个政府现在已经威信扫地，所以，如果麦克米伦要对国家尽责，他就应该举行一次新的大选。
    另一个工党议员齐里亚库斯星期日说，索耳兹伯里的辞职“表明了政府的深刻的危机。这种危机是无法医治的，并且还将加深，一直到它使保守党人分裂或者迫使他们宣布大选，或者一直到两者兼而有之的程度。困难在于：保守党的那种一般的治疗创伤的方法已经过时了五十年，不会再发生作用了，而保守党中那些‘死硬派’所竭力主张的血腥的办法则过时了一百年，并且足以招致灾难。”
    布莱思的保守党议员候选人尼古拉斯·里德莱说，索耳兹伯里的辞职是“特别的，也是人们没有预料到的”。他说：“由于不驯顺的主教的缘故而使政府的大船触礁，这真是令人遗憾。”
