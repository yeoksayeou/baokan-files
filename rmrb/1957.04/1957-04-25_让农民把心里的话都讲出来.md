Let the Peasants Speak Their Minds

How can we make political and ideological education work in rural areas lively, dynamic, and truly welcomed by the broad masses of peasants, and genuinely resolve ideological problems? The experience of Yuci County, Shanxi Province, proves that the best method is to fully promote democracy under strong leadership, allowing the masses to break through all misgivings, say what they have to say, fully expose contradictions, and engage in free discussion, thereby naturally arriving at their own conclusions.

The socialist system is fully in line with the fundamental interests of the peasants. However, it is undeniable that in rural life after cooperation, in the relationship between workers and peasants, and between urban and rural areas, there are still some contradictions that need to be properly adjusted and resolved for various reasons. It has only been a little over a year since the vast majority of Chinese peasants embarked on the socialist road. On the one hand, their economic and political lifestyles have undergone great changes, and on the other hand, the thinking of both cooperative cadres and members has not yet fully adapted to the new situation and new life. Therefore, within the cooperative, people often have many differing opinions on production arrangements, financial management, and profit distribution; between cooperative members and between cooperative members and cadres, there are often many disagreements; in the relationship between urban and rural areas and between workers and peasants, many peasants also have many opinions on the prices of industrial and agricultural products, workers' wages, the state's monopoly purchase and marketing of grain and oil, the supply of cotton cloth, and farmers entering cities for employment. These are all contradictions. Contradictions must be resolved. Small contradictions that are not resolved in time will develop into large contradictions. To resolve contradictions, one must first expose them. First of all, peasants must be allowed to dare to express their opinions on all aspects (whether satisfied or dissatisfied, whether correct or incorrect) without reservation, and then they should be guided to have free discussions. Even if all problems cannot be solved at once through free discussion, it can always help peasants to gradually understand the overall situation and distinguish right from wrong. Only in this way can leaders recognize their own shortcomings in their work and make earnest corrections under the supervision of the masses. The process of educating the masses is also the process of leaders being educated.

Of course, it is not so easy to get the masses to fully express their inner thoughts, to "put what is said in the sorghum fields on the table." This requires an environment with a very strong democratic atmosphere. First of all, the leadership should not be afraid of criticism, of exposing problems, or of things "getting out of hand." Perhaps some people's opinions are wrong, but they should not be casually "labeled," but rather discussed and debated with them in a friendly manner. "Labeling" can only cover up the problem and suppress it in the peasants' hearts, but it cannot make the problem disappear; if suppressed for a long time, it will eventually erupt, which will put the leaders in a passive position.

In ideological education work, one can often see such a practice: only cadres from above and local grassroots cadres tell the peasant masses all kinds of truths and criticize all kinds of wrong ideas among the masses, without the masses' own discussions, and even less often is there free and heated debate. Although this has played some positive role, it is often not very effective. Some peasants, after listening to the great truths told by the cadres, even if they don't say it, are still not convinced from the bottom of their hearts, and some even have resentment in their hearts. Can we blame the masses for being "stubborn" or "difficult to lead"? Of course not. This can only be blamed on the fact that the propagandists have adopted the wrong working methods and attitudes. These comrades only regard themselves as teachers of the masses, as intelligent people, and do not realize that there are many teachers and many Zhuge Liangs among the masses; they do not believe that with the leadership's patient enlightenment and guidance, the masses can correctly understand socialism and accept the policies of the Party and the state through their own life experiences and thinking.

    让农民把心里的话都讲出来
    怎样才能把农村中的政治思想教育工作做得生动活泼、富有生气，使它真正受到广大农民的欢迎、真正解决思想问题呢？山西榆次县的经验证明，最好的方法就是在坚强的领导下放手发扬民主，让群众打破一切顾虑，有什么讲什么，充分暴露矛盾，展开自由讨论，从而十分自然地得出群众自己的结论。
    社会主义制度同农民的根本利益是完全一致的，但是，不可否认，在合作化以后的农村生活中，在工农关系和城乡关系上，由于种种原因，还存在着一些有待于妥善调整和解决的矛盾。我国绝大部分农民走上社会主义道路还只有一年多。一方面他们的经济生活和政治生活的方式已经发生了大变化，另方面社干部和社员的思想都还未能和新的形势、新的生活完全相适应。因此，在合作社内部，人们在生产安排、财务管理、收益分配等方面，在社员和社员之间，在社员和社干部之间，常常有很多分歧的意见；在城乡关系和在工农关系上，许多农民对于工农业产品价格、工人工资、粮食和油料统购统销、棉布供应、农民进城就业等等，也有不少意见。这些都是矛盾。矛盾必须解决。小矛盾不及时解决就会发展成大矛盾。要解决矛盾就先要暴露矛盾。首先要让农民敢于把他们对于各方面的意见（不论满意的或是不满意的，不论正确的或是错误的）都无保留地讲出来，然后引导他们自由讨论。通过自由讨论即使不能一下解决全部问题，但是总可以帮助农民一步一步认清大局，辨别是非。也只有这样，领导者才能认清自己在工作中的缺点，在群众的督促下切实改正。教育群众的过程，也正是领导者受教育的过程。
    当然，要让群众把心里的话完全讲出来，“把高粱地里说的话摆在桌面上”，并不是那么容易的，这必须有一个民主空气十分浓厚的环境。首先是领导方面不要怕批评，不要怕暴露问题，不要怕“乱套”。也许有些人的意见是错误的，但是不能随便“扣帽子”，而只能同他们和和气气地讨论辩论。“扣帽子”只能把问题掩盖起来，压在农民心里，却不能使问题消失；压得久了，它终于会爆发出来，那就会使领导者陷于被动。
    在思想教育工作方面，常常可以看到这样一种做法，就是：只有从上面来的干部和当地的基层干部向农民群众讲述各种各样的道理，批判群众中的各种各样的错误思想，没有群众自己的讨论，更难得有自由的、热烈的争论。这样做虽然也起了一些积极作用，但是常常效果不大。有些农民听完了干部讲的大道理，即使嘴上不说，也仍然不是心悦诚服，有的甚至内心还有反感。这能怪群众“顽固不化”吗？能怪群众“不好领导”吗？当然不能。这只能怪宣传教育者采取的工作方法和态度不对头。这些同志只是把自己看成是群众的先生，是头脑聪明的人，而没有认识在群众中有很多先生，有很多诸葛亮；不相信经过领导方面耐心的启发和引导，群众就能够通过自己的生活经验和思考，来正确地认识社会主义，接受党和国家的政策。
