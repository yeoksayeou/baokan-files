Leaders must grasp the laws of scientific work and understand the joys and hardships of scientists' work. Strengthen the Party's comprehensive leadership over science.

In the upsurge of the nationwide march towards science, Chairman Mao's instruction on strengthening the Party's leadership over science at the Propaganda Work Conference was very timely. This once again demonstrates the Party's deep concern for scientific work, which will undoubtedly be warmly welcomed and supported by scientists across the country. Strengthening leadership is conducive to scientific development, the Party is fully capable of leading science, and has done a good job of leading science in the past—these issues have already been thoroughly explained by some scientists. Now I will add some personal views.

When it comes to the issue of leadership, we first think of Chairman Mao's brilliant instruction in "Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership" (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume III, page 919): "The combination of the general and the individual, the combination of the leadership and the masses." I think this principle also applies to the Party's leadership over science. The direction of strengthening leadership is nothing more than this.

Just as Comrade Tu Changwang said, the Party's general leadership of science in the past (the guidelines and policies, task planning, and organizational mobilization of natural science research) was not only done, but was done very well ("My Understanding of the Connotation of Leadership"). Today, the high level of enthusiasm of scientific workers and the large-scale unfolding of scientific work all demonstrate the great achievements of the Party's correct leadership. In the scientific plan, the Party led thousands of scientists in formulating the country's most important scientific and technological tasks, and affirmed some urgently needed disciplines to be developed and the methods and steps to develop these disciplines. This year, it also coordinated the research work of various units. In this way, the Party has gradually moved from general leadership to specific leadership. I think it is this aspect that needs to be strengthened; only by strengthening specific leadership can we truly combine "the general and the individual." To do a good job of specific leadership, Comrade Zhou Yang said well in his reply to the Wenhui Daily reporter, "Leaders must learn to master the laws of scientific...work." It is impossible to ask leaders to understand the content of all sciences, especially the content of research work. In the eighteenth century, a person could call himself a philosopher and understand everything. In the nineteenth century, people could still call themselves mathematicians or physicists. Today, in the 1950s, even someone calling himself a physicist has to be a little cautious. His specialty may be nuclear physics, optics, etc. This is the result of scientific development, and the division of labor is bound to become more and more refined. An outstanding physicist leading a physics institute may not be able to say that he is an expert in every research topic in the institute; however, he can understand whether each research direction has sufficient scientific basis, whether the method is correct, and so on. When we say that we require the Party to strengthen specific leadership, of course, it is not specific to instructing every scientist on how to carry out their work every day, which is impossible and unnecessary. If leaders can master the laws of scientific work, they can lead, not just lead a part, but comprehensively lead.

Mastering the laws of scientific work is also conducive to combining leadership with the masses. Scientific work is creative labor, and there are many joys and hardships that are not easily understood by ordinary people. To give an example of experimental science, the founder of architectural acoustics, Sabine, spent a full five years at the beginning of his research, doing countless experiments, before finally obtaining his famous formula—only two centimeters long in total. Experimental scientists who have had such experiences are not in the minority. On the other hand, of course, there are also many experimental research works that can be completed within a few days, and several or even dozens of papers can be written in a year. How can leaders understand the work of scientists from the level of their work and the quality of their work, and give them appropriate evaluations? This is a very important and very difficult problem. I fully agree with Director Yan Jici's proposal ("Transforming Scientists, Respecting Scientists"). Many scientists, especially older scientists, have received bourgeois education, and they are eager to be transformed. On the other hand, in order to give full play to their strength, it is also necessary to respect them. What are they most concerned about? Would they be satisfied if they were treated with respect, courtesy, and even given more care in their material life? I think quite the opposite. What a scientist is most concerned about is his profession. Respecting his profession, giving his work an appropriate evaluation, and supporting his research work in his profession is the greatest respect for a scientist. "A scholar is used by those who know him," only in this way can he be truly "known," and he is willing to die for it. If leaders can "know" their scientists, it is easy to combine leadership with the masses.

The Party has led science in the past, and will strengthen its leadership over science in the future. This is a decisive driving force for our country's march towards science. The Party is capable of leading science, not only in a general or partial way, but also in a comprehensive way. Under the Party's strengthened leadership, the happy Chinese scientific workers will work more effectively, so that the country's science can catch up with or approach the world's advanced level in a relatively short period of time.

    领导科学、领导科学家
    中国科学院技术科学部委员　马大猷领导者要掌握科学工作的规律，还要了解科学家工作的甘苦。加强党对科学的全面领导。
    在全国向科学进军的高潮中，毛主席在宣传工作会议上提出的加强党对科学的领导的指示是非常适时的，这又一次说明党对科学工作的亲切关怀，无疑的将受到全国科学工作者的热烈欢迎和拥护。加强领导有助于科学发展，党完全能够领导科学，并且在过去已经很好地领导科学了——这些问题都已经由一些科学家透彻地说明了。现在我补充一些个人的看法。
    提到领导问题，我们首先想到毛主席在“关于领导方法的若干问题”（毛泽东选集，第三卷，919页）中提出的“一般和个别相结合，领导和群众相结合”的英明指示。我觉得这个原则也同样适用于党对科学的领导。加强领导的方向，也不外乎此。
    正像涂长望同志所说，党过去对科学的一般的领导（自然科学研究的方针政策，任务规划和组织动员）不但是作了，并且已经作得很好（“我对领导的涵义的理解”）。今天科学工作者的高度积极性和科学工作的大量展开，都说明党的正确领导已取得巨大成效。在科学规划中，党领导上千位科学家制定了国家最重要的科学技术的任务，并且肯定了急需发展的一些学科和发展这些学科的方法和步骤，在今年还进行了各单位研究工作的协调。这样，党就从一般领导逐渐进入了具体领导。我认为，需要加强的正是这方面；只有加强具体领导，才能真正把“一般和个别相结合”。要作好具体领导，周扬同志在答文汇报记者问中说得好，“领导者要学会掌握科学……工作的规律”。不可能要求领导者了解各门科学的内容，特别是研究工作的内容。在十八世纪，一个人可以自称为哲学家，什么学问都懂。在十九世纪，人们还可以自称为数学家，物理学家。到二十世纪五十年代的今日，一个人自称为物理学家也要保留一点了。他的专长可能是核子物理，光学等等。这是科学发展的结果，分工必然是一天比一天细。一个出色的物理学家领导一个物理研究所，他也未必能说他对所内的研究题目个个都是内行；但是，他可以去了解每个研究方向是否有足够科学根据，方法是不是对头等等。我们说要求党加强具体领导，当然不是具体到指示每一个科学家每日如何进行工作，这是不可能的，也是不必要的。领导者要是掌握科学工作的规律，就可以领导，不是领导某部分而是全面领导。
    掌握科学工作的规律也有利于领导与群众的结合。科学工作是创造性的劳动，其中有很多甘苦都是一般人不容易了解的。举个实验科学的例子来说，建筑声学的创始人赛宾在开始研究的时候，足足花了五年的时间，作了无数次的实验，最后才获得了他的著名公式——一共只有二公分长。实验科学家有这样经验的恐不在少数。在另一方面，当然也有不少实验研究工作是可以克日完成的，一年可以写出几篇，甚至几十篇论文。领导者如何能从科学家的工作水平，工作质量来了解科学家的工作，给他以恰当的评价，这是非常重要，也是非常困难的问题。我完全赞成严济慈主任的提法（“改造科学家，尊重科学家”）。许多科学家，特别是年纪稍大的科学家，都受过资产阶级教育，他们迫切要求改造。在另一方面，为了发挥他们的力量，也有尊重他们的必要。他们最关心的是什么呢？向他们恭恭敬敬，客客气气，甚至在物质生活上多给些照顾，是不是他们就很满意呢？我看刚好相反，一个科学家最关心的是他的专业，尊重他的专业，给他的工作以恰当的评价，支持他在专业方面的研究工作，这是对科学家的最大尊重。“士为知己者用”，只有这样才算真正“知”他，要他死他也愿意。领导者要能“知”他的科学家，就很容易作到领导与群众结合了。
    党在过去已领导了科学，今后将更加强对科学的领导，这对我国的向科学进军是一个决定性的动力。党是能够领导科学的，不仅是一般的或部分的领导，而且是全面的领导。在党的加强领导下，幸福的中国科学工作者们，将更有效地工作，使祖国科学在比较短的时间内赶上或接近世界先进水平。
