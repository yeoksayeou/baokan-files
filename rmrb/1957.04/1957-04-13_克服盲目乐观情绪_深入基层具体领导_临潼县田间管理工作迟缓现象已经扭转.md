    Overcoming Blind Optimism, Deepening Grassroots Specific Leadership
    Slow Progress in Field Management in Lintong County Reversed

    (Our Newspaper, Reporter Zhu Bo) reported: The slow progress in field management work in Lintong County, Shaanxi, has been reversed in March (Editor's note: On March 12, this newspaper published an article entitled "Don't Miss the Good Springtime of March," which commented on the previous neglect of field management in Lintong County). The Lintong County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held several telephone conferences, emphasizing that March is a crucial month for this year's bumper harvest. It demanded that leaders at all levels immediately take measures to overcome blind optimism and reverse the slow progress in field management. At the same time, a group of cadres were transferred to the grassroots to strengthen specific leadership. The cadres went deep into various agricultural cooperatives and production teams (groups) to specifically help them arrange production activities for March and the allocation of manpower and animal power. Field management work was then carried out.

    According to statistics at the end of March, 80% of the wheat fields in the county have been top-dressed with fertilizer (last year, the wheat fields top-dressed with fertilizer accounted for 35% of the total wheat field area). Before March 27, the county had completed the first spring hoeing; the second spring hoeing accounted for about 20% of the total wheat field area.

    In the past, the county did not pay attention to the management of small summer crops. This year, 50% of the total area of small summer crops in the county has been top-dressed with fertilizer; all the small summer crops that could be hoeed have also been hoeed once.

    According to the survey results of the Yanliang District Agricultural Technology Extension Station, both the regular wheat and the rotated wheat are growing better than last year. Generally, the average regular wheat has 300,000 to 400,000 plants per mu, exceeding the 50,000 to 100,000 plants per mu of regular wheat last year. Yanliang District is a dry plain area, which can represent the situation in most parts of Lintong.

### 克服盲目乐观情绪　深入基层具体领导  临潼县田间管理工作迟缓现象已经扭转

    克服盲目乐观情绪　深入基层具体领导
    临潼县田间管理工作迟缓现象已经扭转
    本报讯　本报记者朱波报道：陕西临潼县田间管理工作上存在的迟缓现象，在3月份内已经扭转过来（编者注：3月12日本报发表“切莫误三月好春光”一文，评述了临潼县在这以前有忽视田间管理的现象）。中共临潼县委先后召开了几次电话会议，强调3月是今年丰产的关键月，要求各地领导人员立即采取措施，克服盲目乐观情绪，扭转田间管理工作上的迟缓现象。同时，又抽调一批干部到基层去，加强具体领导。干部都深入到各农业社、生产队（组），具体帮助他们安排3月份的生产活路，和人力畜力的分配问题。田间管理工作便开展起来。
    根据3月底的统计，全县施追肥的麦田已达到80％（去年施追肥的麦田占麦田总面积35％）。在3月27日前，全县已经完成第一次春锄；完成第二次春锄的约占麦田总面积的20％。
    这个县过去不重视小夏田的管理工作。今年全县给小夏田施追肥的已达小夏田总面积的50％；能够进行春锄的小夏田也都锄完一遍。
    根据阎良区农业技术推广站调查结果来看，无论正茬麦和回茬麦都比去年生长得好，一般的正茬麦平均每亩有三十到四十万株，超过去年正茬麦五万到十万株左右。阎良区是旱原地区，可以代表临潼大部地区的情况。
