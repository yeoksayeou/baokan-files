    The More One Debates, the Clearer It Becomes
    ——On the Debates at the Second Plenary Session of the Third National Congress of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang on Several Issues
    By our reporter

    From March 25th to 30th, the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang convened the Second Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee. The attending committee members studied Chairman Mao's report at the Supreme State Conference and Premier Zhou's report at the CPPCC. Their understanding of many major domestic and international events became clearer, and after discussion, their views on some issues, which were not entirely the same, basically converged.

    Why are contradictions among the people so prominent today?

    Chairman Mao's report at the Supreme State Conference on "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" was the issue of greatest concern to everyone, and the discussion was very heated.

    Why do contradictions among the people seem so prominent now? There were various views.

    Some people believed: In the past, the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Campaigns, the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and land reform had deviations and wronged people. They didn't dare to speak before, but now they dare to speak, so internal contradictions have become tense.

    Some people believed: Although the achievements of past work were the main thing, there were also many serious shortcomings, especially the serious bureaucratic style of some cadres in many places, and the problems of the masses were not resolved in a timely and proper manner, so internal contradictions became tense.

    Most people believed: After the basic completion of socialist transformation and the basic elimination of the system of exploitation, the contradictions among the people, which are a reflection of the contradictions between the productive forces and the relations of production, and between the economic base and the superstructure, became prominent. For example, in the past, schools were mostly attended by the children of landlords, rich peasants, and the bourgeoisie, but now the children of workers and peasants can study. The system enabled everyone to stand up, but economic and cultural undertakings have not kept up, so contradictions have arisen. In terms of thinking, the subjective cannot adapt to the objective. In an era of great change, the objective situation develops rapidly, and the thinking of the general public cannot keep up. Some people who came from hostile classes have undergone changes in their social status after land reform and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, but some people's thinking has not completely changed, and the old ideas of the hostile classes are still quite strong, and they often look at problems with old eyes, so the distance between the subjective and the objective is very large. Contradictions among the people are also manifested in this regard.

    Everyone also talked about how to resolve contradictions among the people. Many people said that after listening to Chairman Mao's speech, they knew that contradictions between the enemy and us and contradictions among the people are different in nature. It is natural and not terrible to have contradictions among the people. As long as we recognize it, we can also solve it. Some people suggested solutions: Some problems in people's lives should be solved as long as they can be solved; problems that should be solved but cannot be solved for the time being should be explained to the people; if someone raises unreasonable demands, necessary explanations should also be made. Some people said: To resolve internal contradictions, we must overcome bureaucracy, expand democracy, and use the method of unity—criticism—unity. We must be strict with ourselves and lenient with others.

    What is the nature of the Taiwan issue?

    When discussing the Taiwan issue, everyone believed that peaceful liberation of Taiwan was possible, and they all expressed their willingness to contribute to the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, and their enthusiasm was high. However, there were initially different views on the nature of the Taiwan issue. These different views were: Is the Taiwan issue a matter of the enemy versus us, or a contradiction among the people?

    A minority of people thought it was a contradiction among the people, and their main reason was: Since the slogan of "patriotism as one family" has been put forward to Taiwan, a family is of course a matter within the people. Therefore, there should be "only friendship and no hostility."

    The majority of people believed it was a matter of the enemy versus us, and their reasons were: Although Taiwan is wavering internally, and a considerable number of people are inclined to the motherland, the Taiwan authorities are still in a state of war with us. Chiang Kai-shek is still relying on American imperialism, and he is still planning to restore his rule, and special agents are still being sent over regularly. Therefore, before the liberation of Taiwan, the contradiction between us and the Taiwan authorities is still a contradiction between the enemy and us.

    Chairman Li Jishen also affirmed in his final speech: The Taiwan issue is a contradiction between the enemy and us, but this contradiction can be transformed. If the Taiwan authorities accept peaceful liberation, the contradiction between the enemy and us will be transformed into a contradiction among the people.

    How should we treat the suppression of counter-revolutionaries?

    After discussion of the issue of suppressing counter-revolutionaries, everyone affirmed that the achievements of the past suppression of counter-revolutionaries were the main thing, and supported the policy of "counter-revolutionaries must be suppressed, and mistakes must be corrected."

    During the discussion, a few people believed that counter-revolutionaries should be "suppressed" by the public security departments, and that mass movements should not be launched. Taking the mass line is prone to excess and creates deviations.

    However, most people believed that the movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries must be carried out by extensively mobilizing the masses, so that we can distinguish between the enemy and us, and educate the masses. Only after the masses are mobilized can counter-revolutionaries be thoroughly suppressed, and can deviations be prevented or reduced. Some people at the meeting also cited some vivid real-life examples to illustrate the great achievements made in carrying out the suppression of counter-revolutionaries by mobilizing the masses.

    Can democratic parties supervise the Communist Party?

    When talking about the issue of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," there was also some debate. The debate was about whether the Communist Party could be supervised.

    One opinion was that it could not. Another opinion was that it could.

    Those who thought it could not said: There are concerns about criticizing the Communist Party. Why? Because: First, the Communist Party has a high level and is politically strong, while we have a low level and are politically weak, making criticism difficult. Second, Communist Party members only accept opinions that they like to hear. Especially some Communist Party members at the lower levels, who have low levels and cannot distinguish right from wrong, it is a waste of time to offer opinions.

    Those who thought it could said: The Communist Party is a Marxist-Leninist party, and is the core force leading our country, so its political level is naturally high. Therefore, we must conscientiously accept the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and must learn from the Communist Party. However, the democratic parties are connected to certain social strata and can represent their legitimate interests and reflect their opinions and demands, which is conducive to correctly resolving contradictions among the people and is conducive to the socialist cause. As for whether we can criticize the Communist Party, it is definitely possible, and the Communist Party has always welcomed others to offer criticism. We should, in the spirit of knowing everything and saying everything, try our best to reflect our views and opinions. Speaking of this issue, a member of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang who holds a position as a bureau chief in a government agency said that the CCP branch in his unit formulated an employee study plan, stipulating that they would study six times a week. He thought it was too much, and later it was reduced to four times according to his opinion. However, our opinions are not necessarily all correct. Sometimes, due to time, place, and conditions, there are inevitably one-sided and incorrect aspects, so we cannot demand that the Communist Party follow them all. Of course, there are also individual Communist Party members who are not respectful enough of democratic people and are not humble enough to listen to opinions. We should kindly help them. Mutual supervision should not be understood as mutual opposition.

    At the meeting, there was also discussion of how to better achieve mutual supervision. Many people said: In the final analysis, we should put our ideological remoulding first. Without this, we cannot do our work well. This is the key to the whole problem.

    愈辩愈明
    ——记民革三届二中全会关于几个问题的争论
    本报记者
    3月25日到30日，中国国民党革命委员会召开了第三届中央委员会第二次全体会议。到会的委员学习了毛主席在最高国务会议上的报告和周总理在政协的报告，对国内外许多大事的认识都更加明确，对一些问题不完全相同的看法，经过讨论，基本上趋于一致。
    人民内部矛盾为什么今天显得突出？
    毛主席在最高国务会议上关于“正确地处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告，是大家最关心的问题，讨论得很为热烈。
    为什么现在人民内部矛盾问题显得突出呢？看法有多种。
    有人认为：过去，三反，五反，镇压反革命，土地改革，这些斗争中有偏差，整错了人，他们以前不敢说话，现在敢说话了，内部矛盾因而紧张起来。
    有人认为：过去的工作成绩虽然是主要的，但缺点也是很多很严重的，特别是许多地方的某些干部有严重的官僚主义作风，群众的问题得不到及时的、妥善的解决，所以内部矛盾紧张了。
    大多数人认为：在社会主义改造基本完成，剥削制度基本消灭以后，由于生产力和生产关系之间的矛盾，经济基础和上层建筑之间的矛盾，反映出来的人民内部的矛盾也就突出了。譬如，过去的学校里多半是地主、富农、资产阶级的子弟，现在工农子弟都可以念书了。制度使大家翻了身，可是经济事业、文教事业都还赶不上来，因此发生矛盾。在思想方面，主观不能和客观适应。在大变动时代，客观形势发展很快，一般人思想赶不上。另一些出身于敌对阶级的人，经过土地改革、肃反斗争，社会地位发生了变化，但是有些人的思想还没有完全改变，旧的敌对阶级的思想还相当浓厚，常用旧眼光看问题，主观和客观距离很大。人民内部矛盾也从这方面表现出来。
    大家也谈到如何解决人民内部矛盾。不少人说，听了毛主席的讲话，知道敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾性质不同。人民内部有矛盾，很自然，并不可怕。只要认识了它，也可以解决它。解决的办法，有人提出：人民生活上的一些问题，只要能够解决的，就应当解决；应当解决而一时不能解决的，要向人民讲清道理；如果有人提出了不合理的要求，还应当作必要的解释。有的人说：解决内部矛盾，要克服官僚主义，扩大民主，要运用团结——批评——团结的方法。必须厚责于己，薄责于人。
    台湾问题是什么性质的问题？
    讨论到台湾问题的时候，大家认为，台湾和平解放有可能，都表示愿意在和平解放台湾中贡献自己的力量，热情很高。但对台湾问题的性质，最初也曾有过不同的看法。这不同的看法是：台湾问题是敌我问题还是人民内部矛盾问题。
    认为是人民内部矛盾问题的是少数人，他们的主要理由是：既然对台湾提出“爱国一家”的号召，一家人，当然是人民内部问题。所以应当“只有友情，毫无敌意”。
    认为是敌我问题的是多数人，他们的理由是：虽然台湾内部在动摇，相当一部分人倾向祖国，但台湾当局对我们到现在还处在战争状态。蒋介石还投靠美帝国主义，他还打算复辟，特务还在经常派来。所以台湾在解放以前，我们与台湾当局之间的矛盾，仍然是敌我矛盾。
    李济深主席最后发言中也肯定地说：台湾问题是敌我矛盾，但是，这个矛盾是可以转化的。如果台湾当局接受和平解放，敌我矛盾就转化成人民内部问题了。
    怎样对待肃反？
    肃清反革命问题，经过讨论，大家肯定了过去肃反的成绩是主要的，并且拥护“有反必肃，有错必纠”的方针。
    在讨论中，曾有少数人认为：要肃反，由公安部门“肃”，不要发动群众搞运动。走群众路线，容易过火，造成偏差。
      但大多数人认为：肃反运动必须广泛发动群众来进行，这样既能分清敌我，又能教育群众。只有在群众发动起来之后，才能彻底肃清反革命，也才能防止或减少偏差。有人在会上还举出了一些现实的生动事例，说明发动群众进行肃反所取得的巨大成绩。
    民主党派能监督共产党么？
    谈起“长期共存，互相监督”的问题，也有所争论。争论是对共产党能不能监督？
    一种意见是说不能。另一种意见是说能。
    认为不能的人说：对共产党批评，有顾虑。为什么？因为：一、共产党水平高，政治强，自己水平低，政治弱，批评有困难。二、共产党员接受意见，爱听的才听。特别是下边的一些共产党员，水平低，不辨是非，提了意见白费。
    认为能的人说：共产党是马克思列宁主义的政党，是领导我们国家的核心力量，政治水平自然是高的，因此，我们必须切实接受中国共产党的领导，必须向共产党学习。但是，民主党派联系着一定的社会阶层，可以代表他们的正当利益，反映他们的意见和要求，这有利于正确解决人民内部的矛盾，有利于社会主义事业。至于对共产党能不能批评，肯定是能的，共产党也一向欢迎人家对它提出批评。我们应当本着知无不言、言无不尽的精神，尽量反映自己的看法和意见。谈到这个问题，有一位在政府机关担任局长职务的民革中央委员说，他所在单位的中共党支部制订职工学习计划，规定每周学习六次，他认为太多，后来还是照他的意见减少为四次。但是，我们的意见不一定全部是正确的，有时由于时间、地点和条件的关系，难免有片面和不正确的地方，所以不能要求共产党全部照办。当然，也有个别共产党员对民主人士还不够尊重，听取意见还不够虚心，应该善意地帮助他们。互相监督，不能理解为互相对立。
    在会上，也谈到了如何更好地实现互相监督。许多人都说：归根到底，应该把我们的思想改造放在第一位。没有这一条，就无法作好工作。这是全部问题的关键所在。
