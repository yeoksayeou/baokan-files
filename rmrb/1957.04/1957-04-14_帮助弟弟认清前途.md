Helping My Younger Brother Recognize His Future
    He Guangzhong

    My only beloved younger brother will graduate from junior high school this year, and I am very concerned about whether he can continue his education.

    In the past, I always thought like this: my brother's academic performance is quite good, and the family's economic situation is not bad. I want to do everything possible to ensure my brother goes to college. I rarely considered what my brother would do if he couldn't go to school.

    After reading the People's Daily editorial on April 8th, my views changed. It is normal for a portion of middle school graduates not to continue their education, and this will be the case for a considerable period of time. Every year, more and more middle school graduates participating in agricultural production is necessary for the development of agricultural production, and it is a good thing.

    Although after reading the speeches made by some members of the CPPCC on the issue of enrollment and employment of middle school graduates, I wrote to my brother and asked him to prepare ideologically for further education and participation in agricultural production, I still emphasized making preparations for further education, and participating in agricultural production was only a last resort. It can be seen that my understanding of the important issue of middle school graduates participating in agricultural production was unclear, and I was doing it reluctantly rather than consciously.

    The editorial made me begin to understand many deep issues. When I read the last section of the editorial, I was so moved that I couldn't help but burst into tears. I deeply understood what the Party was saying. I am a Communist Party member, and this time I will respond to the Party's call as resolutely as I have at any time in the past: resolutely respond, resolutely implement, without saying a second word.

    Now what I have to do is to educate my brother (and also educate myself) with the spirit of the editorial, clarify his thinking, recognize his future, and prepare to participate in agricultural production. If my brother fails to get into high school, he will "take the commune as his home and farmers as his friends," and bring revolutionary zeal to build a new countryside, striving to become an excellent soldier on the agricultural front.

    帮助弟弟认清前途
    何光中
    我唯一的一个心爱的弟弟今年将初中毕业，他能不能升学是我很关心的事。
    过去，我总这样想：我的弟弟学习成绩相当好，家庭的经济状况也不坏。我要想一切办法使弟弟一直读到大学。很少考虑如果弟弟升不上学干什么？
    看了人民日报4月8日的社论后，可不然了。一部分中小学毕业生不能升学是正常的现象，而且在相当长时期内都将是这样。每年越来越多的中学毕业生参加农业生产是发展农业生产所必需的，是件好事情。
    虽然我看了政协会议上有些委员关于中小学毕业生升学和就业的问题发言以后，就写信给弟弟叫他作好升学和参加农业生产的思想准备。但是说的还是着重作升学准备，参加农业生产只是在无可奈何情况下的一着棋。可见，在我的思想上对中学毕业生参加农业生产这一重大问题是认识不清的，做的是很勉强的，而不是自觉的。
    社论使我开始明确了很多、很深的问题。当我读到社论的最后一节，感动得禁不住热泪如注。我深刻地体会党的这番话。我是一个共产党员，这一次我将和过去任何时候对待党的号召一样：坚决响应，坚决执行，不说二话。
    现在我要做的就是以社论的精神教育我的弟弟（也教育自己），明确思想，认清前途，作好参加农业生产的准备。如果弟弟考不取高中，就“以社为家，以农为友”，拿出革命劲头来建设新农村，争取成为农业战线上的一个优秀战士。
