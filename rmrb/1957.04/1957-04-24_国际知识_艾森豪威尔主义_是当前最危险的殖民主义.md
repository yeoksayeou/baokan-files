International Knowledge "Eisenhower Doctrine" is the Most Dangerous Colonialism Today
Hu Ping
The powerful tide of anti-colonialism among the peoples of Asia and Africa is drastically changing the face of the Eastern world. At the same time, colonialists are also taking various measures to counterattack. The Anglo-French armed aggression against Egypt was one way; the United States' proposal of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is another. The main feature of the latter is its particular hypocrisy. However, in the past three months, the colonialist essence of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" has been gradually exposed in more and more facts.

	The Exposure of Bermuda
After the initial slogan of "filling the vacuum in the Middle East," which was too blatant, aroused widespread opposition from the people of Arab countries, the United States hurriedly tried to whitewash it, using a large number of anti-communist slogans and samples of American banknotes to dress up "Eisenhower." However, when the leaders of the United States and Britain held talks in Bermuda in late March to redistribute colonial interests, the fox's tail of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" involuntarily reappeared. Some major newspapers, speaking for the US ruling group, bluntly stated: the "Eisenhower Doctrine" was put forward because of the "decline of Britain and other Western European colonial countries as centers of world power" and the "westward shift of the forces of the free world to the United States," and the United States and Britain must make "huge adjustments" to their colonial interests in the Middle East (New York Times). They also said that because of the Suez crisis, Britain's power in the Middle East had declined, "if anything is to be salvaged from this loss, it must be replaced by American power and influence" (New York Herald Tribune). This is a very blunt statement that the actual purpose of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is to "salvage" colonialist interests in the face of the anti-colonialist surge in the Middle East.

Because the fundamental contradictions between the United States and Britain in their scramble for colonial interests could not be reconciled, the Bermuda talks failed to reach a "coordinated policy" on the Middle East issue; but on the other hand, the United States and Britain reached an understanding on the issue of suppressing the national independence movements in the Middle East. In the words of the "Washington Post": "There was a clear tacit understanding at the Bermuda talks that Britain is willing to follow the leadership of the United States in dealing with Arab countries," in exchange for the United States taking "responsibility" for the "security" of British colonialists, "for vital interests in the canal, and for Middle Eastern oil."

In fact, the United States has already taken on the main task of supporting colonialism in the Middle East. The United States is playing a leading role in insisting on the "internationalization" of the Suez Canal and the Gulf of Aqaba, and in interfering in the situation in Egypt, Syria, and Jordan. Recently, the US President re-raised the 1950 "Tripartite Declaration" of the US, Britain, and France on the Middle East issue and rejected the Soviet proposal that the major powers guarantee non-interference in Middle Eastern affairs. This also shows that while the United States is excluding Britain and France, it still wants to collude with Britain and France to interfere in Middle Eastern affairs.

	Reissue of the "Three C" Policy
The United States' participation in the military committee of the Baghdad Pact is strong evidence of its colonialist identity. The Baghdad Pact has been opposed by the people of Middle Eastern countries, especially most Arab countries, because of its obvious nature of aggression and colonialism. After Britain, the main member of the Baghdad Pact, openly launched armed aggression against Egypt, the opposition to this pact became even stronger, and it fell into paralysis. At this time, the United States, which had been hiding behind the scenes, came forward to support this pact, took over its control from Britain, and used it as a bridgehead to promote the "Eisenhower Doctrine."

Richard, the special envoy sent by the US President to promote the "Eisenhower Doctrine," first visited the Baghdad Pact countries, on the one hand, driving them to support the "Eisenhower Doctrine," and on the other hand, using "military aid" and "economic aid" to strengthen its control over these countries. Richards also brought a plan to build a huge transportation system (including a railway and a highway) connecting Ankara, Baghdad, Tehran, and Karachi. If this plan becomes a reality, then the various US military bases scattered in the Middle East will be connected into one, and it will be much more convenient for the United States to suppress the national independence movements in Middle Eastern countries, plunder their resources, and use them as anti-Soviet war bases.

As early as before the First World War, Germany, which then dreamed of dominating the Middle East, put forward the so-called "Three B" policy, wanting to connect Berlin and Baghdad by railway in order to extend its power into the Middle East. Britain also put forward the so-called "Three C Policy," attempting to build a railway from Cape Town through Cairo to Calcutta, in order to strengthen its rule over the vast colonies in Asia and Africa. Both of these imperialist plans failed. Today, the "Eisenhower Doctrine" has picked up their ideas again, which is also very helpful in explaining the essence of the "Eisenhower Doctrine."

	The Conspiracy of "Internationalizing" Oil Pipelines
Plundering the rich oil deposits in the Middle East is a major motive of the "Eisenhower Doctrine." US Senator Kefauver also admitted that this "doctrine" "is mainly drafted according to the needs of international oil companies." Under the guidance of this "doctrine," the heads of the US government negotiated with the heads of the British government in Bermuda on the distribution of Middle Eastern oil rights. Echoing the government's diplomatic activities, American oil monopoly companies are also active everywhere in the Middle East. Currently, one of their main goals is to seize the Qom oil field newly discovered by the Iranian National Oil Company. Many American companies have been active in Tehran for a long time. The US government has also intervened. It not only puts pressure on Iran, but also interferes with the oil monopoly groups of Italy and other countries that want to lease this oil field, opposing them from providing Iran with higher concession conditions.

At a press conference not long ago, Dulles confirmed a rumored plan that American oil monopoly companies have been discussing with British and French oil monopoly companies to build a new oil pipeline system in the Middle East—a large oil pipeline from the Mosul oil field in northern Iraq through Turkey to the Mediterranean Sea, and two other branch lines. Dulles openly proposed that when constructing this oil pipeline system, treaties should be signed with Middle Eastern countries to give the oil pipeline an "international status," so that the countries where it is located have no right to "interfere." The purpose of publicizing this oil pipeline construction plan is to make Middle Eastern oil transportation not dependent on the Suez Canal. In reality, it also has a far more sinister colonialist purpose, which is to turn the thousands of kilometers of inland areas of Middle Eastern countries along the oil pipeline into concessions for the United States and other colonial countries.

	The True Meaning of "Protection" and "Aid"
When promoting the "Eisenhower Doctrine," the United States tirelessly promotes that the purpose of the United States is to "protect" Middle Eastern countries from the "threat of Soviet aggression" and "aid" Middle Eastern countries in achieving independent development. However, the people of the Middle East and many responsible political leaders have pointed out that the so-called "threat of Soviet aggression" simply does not exist. The relationship between the Soviet Union and Middle Eastern countries is a truly friendly and selfless relationship. It is the Soviet Union that advocates that major powers should not interfere in Middle Eastern affairs. Now it is the Soviet Union that proposes that the United States, Britain, and France jointly condemn the use of force as a means of resolving outstanding issues in the Middle East. On the contrary, it is the Western imperialist countries that continue large-scale colonial plunder in this region. It is they who, after the failure of armed aggression against Egypt, are still putting various pressures on Egypt to force it to give up its sovereignty. It is they who are interfering in the internal affairs of Middle Eastern countries in various ways, trying to overthrow governments they do not like. They promote the non-existent "threat of Soviet aggression" precisely in order to prevent the people of the Middle East from seeing the Western colonialism that is truly infringing on their interests.

"Protection" in name, aggression in reality, this is originally an old trick of colonialism. As for "aid," it is nothing new. Although US officials have repeatedly tried to make people believe that US aid does not carry any conditions, facts have proven the opposite. The United States and Saudi Arabia signed an "aid" agreement on the condition of extending the lease term of the Dhahran US military base and sending US military personnel to "train" the Saudi Arabian army. The United States issued aid checks to Lebanon, Ethiopia, and other countries on the condition of establishing new US military bases in these countries. Because Jordan announced that it did not intend to accept conditions for US aid, the colonialist forces created a political crisis there, and US propaganda organs took the opportunity to conduct blatant threats and inducements. They said that Jordan would "perish" only if it sought aid from the United States; and if Jordan wants to get aid from the United States, it must "agree with the Eisenhower Doctrine" and "suppress" the anti-imperialist forces in the country.

"Protection" is a cover, "aid" is a means, and in the final analysis, it is all for the colonialist interests of the United States. With the promotion of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," more and more facts have proven that the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is the most dangerous colonialist enemy of the people of all countries today, especially the countries in Asia and Africa. Therefore, in the struggle against colonialism, the people of the Middle East and Asian and African countries are increasingly focusing their struggle on this American-branded new colonialism.

    国际知识“艾森豪威尔主义”是当前最危险的殖民主义
    胡平
    亚非各国人民反对殖民主义的强大潮流，正在急剧地改变着东方世界的面貌。同时，殖民主义者也在采取各种方式进行反扑。英法武装侵略埃及是一种方式；美国提出“艾森豪威尔主义”是又一种方式。后一种的主要特征就是特别伪善。但是，三个多月来，“艾森豪威尔主义”的殖民主义本质，已经在越来越多的事实中逐渐地暴露出来。
            百慕大的暴露
    在最初的“填补中东真空”这个过于露骨的口号引起阿拉伯国家人民的广泛反对之后，美国曾经赶紧进行粉饰，用大量的反共标语和美钞样本把“艾森豪威尔”装扮起来。但是，3月下旬美英两国首脑在百慕大举行会谈、重分殖民利益的时候，“艾森豪威尔主义”的狐狸尾巴不由自主又露出来了。代表美国统治集团发言的一些主要报纸赤裸裸地说：“艾森豪威尔主义”是由于英国和其他西欧殖民国家“作为世界力量中心的衰落”和“自由世界的势力西移美国”而提出来的，美英之间必须把它们在中东的殖民利益进行“巨大的调整”（纽约时报）。它们还说：由于苏伊士事件，英国在中东的力量已经衰落，“如果要从这次损失中抢救出任何东西的话，那么它们必须由美国的力量和势力来代替”（纽约先驱论坛报）。这实在是说得非常露骨，“艾森豪威尔主义”的实际目的就是从中东反殖民主义狂澜面前“抢救”殖民主义的利益。
    由于美英争夺殖民利益的根本矛盾无法调和，百慕大会谈在中东问题上未能得出“协调一致的政策”；但另一方面，在关于镇压中东的民族独立运动的问题上，美英两国却达成了谅解。用“华盛顿邮报”的话来说：“在百慕大会谈上有一个明确的默契，就是在同阿拉伯国家打交道这方面，英国愿意遵循美国的领导”，交换条件是美国对英国殖民者的“安全”，“对在运河的重大利益以及对中东的石油”，都要负起“责任”。
    事实上，美国已经在中东担负起支撑殖民主义的主要任务了。在坚持苏伊士运河和亚喀巴湾“国际化”以及干涉埃及、叙利亚和约旦局势等活动上，美国都起着主导的作用。最近，美国总统重新提起了1950年美、英、法关于中东问题的“三国宣言”而拒绝了苏联提出的主张各大国保证不干涉中东事务的建议，这也表明美国在排挤英法的同时，还是要同英法合伙来干涉中东事务。
          “三C”政策的重版
    美国参加巴格达条约的军事委员会，是暴露它的殖民主义身份的一个有力证据。巴格达条约因为具有明显的侵略和殖民主义的性质，所以它一直受到中东各国人民、特别是大多数阿拉伯国家的反对。在巴格达条约主要成员国英国对埃及公然发动武装侵略之后，这个条约受到的反对更为强烈，陷入了瘫痪状态。这时，一直藏在幕后的美国就出场来支撑这个条约，从英国手里接管了它的控制权，并把它当做推行“艾森豪威尔主义”的桥头堡。
    美国总统派出的推销“艾森豪威尔主义”的特使理查兹访问中东各国，首先到巴格达条约国家活动，一面驱使它们为“艾森豪威尔主义”捧场，另一面利用“军事援助”和“经济援助”，加强对这些国家的控制。理查兹还带着一套计划，要修建一个连接安卡拉、巴格达、德黑兰和卡拉奇的巨大的交通系统（包括一条铁路和一条公路）。这个计划如果成为事实，那么美国分散在中东的各个军事基地就将连成一片，美国镇压中东国家的民族独立运动、掠夺它们的资源、利用它们作为反苏的战争基地，都要方便得多了。
    早在第一次世界大战之前，当时梦想霸占中东的德国就提出过所谓“三B”政策，想用铁路连接柏林和巴格达，以便把势力伸入中东。英国也提出过所谓“三C政策”，企图修建一条从开普敦经开罗到加尔各答的铁路，以加强对亚非地区广大的殖民地的统治。这两个帝国主义的计划都破了产。今天“艾森豪威尔主义”把它们的观念重又拣了起来，这也非常有助于说明“艾森豪威尔主义”的本质。
          “国际化”油管的阴谋
    掠夺中东丰富的石油矿藏，是“艾森豪威尔主义”的一个主要动机。美国参议员克弗维尔也承认：这个“主义”“主要是按照国际石油公司的需要来拟订的”。在这个“主义”的指导下，美国政府首脑同英国政府首脑在百慕大谈判了中东石油权益的分配问题。和政府的外交活动互相呼应，美国的石油垄断公司也在中东到处进行活动。目前，它们的主要目标之一是夺取伊朗国家石油公司新近发现的库姆油田。许多美国公司已在德黑兰活动很久了。美国政府也插手干预。它不但对伊朗施加压力，而且还干涉想要租用这个油田的意大利等其他国家的石油垄断集团，反对它们向伊朗提供较高的租让条件。
    在不久以前的一次记者招待会上，杜勒斯证实了一项传说中的计划，说美国的石油垄断公司已在同英法石油垄断公司商议，要在中东修建一个新的输油管系统——一条从伊拉克北部的摩苏尔油田经土耳其到地中海的大油管和另外两条支线。杜勒斯公然提出：修建这一油管系统时，要同中东国家订立条约，赋予油管以“国际地位”，使所在国家无权“干涉”。这个油管建设计划的被大肆宣传的目的，是使中东石油运输可以不依赖苏伊士运河。实际上它还有着一个远为阴险的殖民主义目的，就是把油管所经过的数千公里沿线中东各国腹地，变成美国和其他殖民国家的租界。
    “保护”和“援助”的真实含义
    美国在推行“艾森豪威尔主义”的时候，不厌其烦地宣传美国的目的在于“保护”中东国家不受“苏联侵略的威胁”，
  “援助”中东国家获得独立的发展。但是中东人民和不少负责的政治领袖都指出，所谓“苏联侵略的威胁”是根本不存在的。苏联同中东国家的关系是一种真正友好无私的关系。是苏联主张大国不干涉中东事务。现在又是苏联建议美英法共同谴责用武力作为解决中东未决问题的手段。相反，是西方帝国主义国家继续着在这个地区的大规模殖民掠夺。是它们在武装侵略埃及失败之后，迄今还对埃及施加种种压力，要它放弃主权。是它们用各种方法干涉着中东国家的内政，设法推翻它们所不喜欢的政府。它们宣传根本不存在的“苏联侵略的威胁”，正是为了想使中东人民看不到真正侵害着他们利益的西方殖民主义。
    “保护”其名，侵略其实，这原是殖民主义的老花样。至于“援助”，也不是什么新鲜的东西。尽管美国官方一再企图使人相信，美援不带有任何条件，但是事实都证明相反。美国和沙特阿拉伯签订了“援助”协定，条件是延长扎赫兰美军基地租期和由美国军事人员去“训练”沙特阿拉伯军队。美国向黎巴嫩、埃塞俄比亚等国开出美援支票，条件是在这些国家建立新的美国军事基地。约旦因为宣布了不打算为美援而接受条件，殖民主义势力就在那里制造了政治危机，美国宣传机关趁机进行了露骨的威胁利诱。它们说，约旦只有从美国寻求援助，否则就会“灭亡”；而约旦如要从美国得到援助，就必须“同意艾森豪威尔主义”，并且“镇压”国内的反帝国主义力量。
      “保护”是幌子，“援助”是手段，归根结底都是为了美国的殖民主义利益。随着“艾森豪威尔主义”的推行，愈来愈多的事实证明了：“艾森豪威尔主义”是各国特别是亚非地区国家人民今天最危险的殖民主义死敌。因此，中东和亚非各国人民在反对殖民主义的斗争中，正在把他们的斗争锋芒愈来愈多地集中到这个美国牌子的新殖民主义上来。
