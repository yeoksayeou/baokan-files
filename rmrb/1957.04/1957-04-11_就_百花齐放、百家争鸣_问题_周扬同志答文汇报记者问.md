    Regarding the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" issue, Wenhui Daily reporter interviews Comrade Zhou Yang

    After the publication of the article "Some Opinions on Current Literary and Art Work" co-authored by Comrades Chen Qitong and others (published in the "People's Daily" on January 7th), it aroused various reactions in academic and literary circles, and in reality, hindered the implementation of the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy. To give the intellectual community a clearer understanding of this comprehensive policy for developing science and literature and art, this newspaper reporter specially interviewed Comrade Zhou Yang, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and raised several questions regarding this situation:

    (1) Since the Central Committee of the Party put forward the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" last year, what important gains have been made in academic and literary circles?
    (2) Do you think that in these few months, have "a hundred flowers" bloomed enough? Have "a hundred schools of thought" contended enough? If not enough, what do you think has hindered the implementation of the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy?
    (3) What are your opinions on the article "Some Opinions on Current Literary and Art Work" co-authored by Comrades Chen Qitong and others? What are your opinions on the "Literary Gazette" commentator's article "The Gongs and Drums of Film"? What is the significance of criticizing these articles for carrying out "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend"?
    (4) What are your opinions on the film issue discussion conducted by our newspaper?
    (5) How do you think we should further carry out "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" to make science and literature and art more prosperous?

    The following are Comrade Zhou Yang's answers to these questions raised by the reporter:

    1. Since the Central Committee of the Party put forward the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" last year, what important gains have been made in academic and literary circles?

    Answer: It has been less than a year since "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" was put forward as a comprehensive policy for developing science and art. Of course, it is too early to demand that great literary works and scientific works be produced in such a short period of time. However, the positive effects produced after the introduction of this policy can already be seen. The atmosphere of free discussion in academic circles has become stronger. In the past year, debates on different opinions have unfolded regarding genetics, Chinese history, Chinese philosophy, aesthetics, and realism in literature and art. Academic and literary publications have greatly increased, with a "spring after the rain" trend. Due to the advocacy of the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy and the advocacy of "marching towards science," the number of academic works published last year was more than all those published in the six years from 1950 to 1955 combined. The opening up of theatrical repertoire is a major event in the opera world. Last year, a large number of traditional repertoires were unearthed throughout the country, and many of them regained life on stage after being reorganized and processed. The scope of subject matter for literary and artistic creation is much broader than before, and the styles and genres are also more diversified. Works that sharply expose and criticize the negative phenomena in life are increasingly attracting people's attention. All these are basically good, normal, and healthy phenomena. This is an atmosphere of activity and prosperity.

    The development of science and art requires an environment suitable for it. For scientists and artists, the conditions of socialist society are naturally many times better than those of capitalist society. However, there are still some things in our environment that are not conducive to the development of science and art, such as dogmatism, sectarianism, and bureaucratic administrative command methods in dealing with scientific and artistic work. With these things, the enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity of scientists and artists will be suppressed and frustrated, and their research and creation careers will not receive the encouragement and support they deserve. After several years of ideological remolding, many scientists and literary and art workers have begun to break away from the shackles of the bourgeois idealist worldview, but have also been more or less shackled by dogmatism. Only when our academic circles get rid of these two shackles can their enthusiasm be brought into play on a new basis. The "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy has stirred up this new enthusiasm of the intellectual community. Everyone has begun to attach importance to independent thinking and objective analysis; not to be superstitious or blindly follow; to dare to adhere to their own correct opinions and refute anyone's incorrect opinions; and to dare to criticize and expose the unreasonable phenomena in life. Science and art are highly creative work, requiring theoretical courage and creative courage. Now everyone's courage is much greater than before. Of course, to produce great works of art and scientific works, it is not enough to have enthusiasm and courage; it also requires practical and hard work. Scientists need to possess a large amount of material and have correct research methods; artists need to have rich life experience and expressive skills; these go without saying. The "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy has greatly improved the enthusiasm of scientists and artists, and this is the most important gain.

    "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" is a policy that effectively mobilizes all the positive factors in the scientific and artistic communities to jointly build socialist culture. To mobilize positive factors, some negative factors will inevitably emerge. Idealistic ideas in academics, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois tendencies in literature and art, and the uncritical acceptance of heritage regardless of good or bad have all appeared. But there is nothing to be afraid of. This is a necessary phenomenon, because all different ideas are reflections of a certain social existence, and they exist objectively. We should soberly estimate that, under our social conditions, positive factors always occupy a dominant and advantageous position, and some things among the negative factors can also be transformed into positive things under correct policies. For example, many parts of feudal culture and capitalist culture can be transformed into a new culture suitable for the needs of the people after being reformed; the parts that cannot be reformed will naturally be eliminated; certain rational components can also be absorbed from the philosophical doctrines of idealists. At the same time, we know that truth can only develop through struggle with falsehood. We should not only let the people see the truth and see the beautiful and good things, but also let the people understand what is false, ugly, and evil. For negative things, our task is not to prohibit the people from approaching them, but to help the people distinguish between truth and falsehood, beauty and ugliness, and good and evil. We believe in the people's discernment, believe in the power of materialism, and believe in the power of truth; at the same time, we must strive to continuously improve the people's discernment and continuously strengthen the force of the struggle between truth and falsehood.

    2. Do you think that in these few months, have "a hundred flowers" bloomed enough? Have "a hundred schools of thought" contended enough? If not enough, what do you think has hindered the implementation of the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy?

    Answer: "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" is a long-term policy of the Party, and the question of whether it has bloomed enough or contended enough simply does not arise, because there will never be a day when it can be said to be enough. Even in communist society, when most people have communist consciousness, there will still be debates on various different opinions in academics, and there will still be mutual competition among various different styles and schools in art. Many old principles in science will continue to be replaced by new principles. Literature and art will continue to be innovated. Right and wrong, advanced and backward, will be eternal contradictions in human life. However, in communist society, the remnants of bourgeois ideology in people's consciousness will gradually disappear, the distinction between physical labor and mental labor will gradually be eliminated, and at that time, everyone will have considerable broad scientific knowledge and artistic ability, and academic monopoly will become unimaginable. By that time, the situation of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" will naturally be completely changed. This is a matter of many years from now, so there is no need to talk about it now.

    What is currently hindering the implementation of the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy? From the perspective of ideological tendencies, we believe that there are mainly two kinds of ideological one-sidedness: the "left" dogmatism and the right-leaning opportunist tendency.

    We believe in Marxist materialism and adhere to the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers in culture. However, dogmatists and opportunists oppose this to the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy. In the eyes of dogmatists, it seems that to have Marxist materialism and the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, one cannot simultaneously have "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend"; at most, they can only talk about it verbally and decorate the facade. In fact, they adopt a skeptical and negative attitude towards this policy. Conversely, opportunists express "welcome" to the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy, but they "welcome" it with a different mood, because they have long been somewhat tired of Marxist materialism and the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. Now that there is a new policy, they can righteously throw away Marxism and the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers as some kind of "dogmatism" and "vulgar sociology," as if not doing so would hinder the implementation of this new policy. On the surface, it seems that they are supporting this policy, but in reality, they are burying it, because they have hooked away the soul of this policy. Dogmatists and opportunists both oppose affirming achievements and correcting shortcomings. The difference is that dogmatists only allow affirming achievements and do not allow criticizing shortcomings. In fact, they are trying their best to protect shortcomings. Conversely, opportunists negate all achievements when criticizing shortcomings. Our attitude is to actively promote Marxism and resolutely implement the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy; to affirm achievements and firmly correct mistakes and shortcomings.

    The "left" mistake in dealing with ideological issues is not to adopt the method of persuasion, but to adopt the method of suppression; not to adopt the attitude of reasoning, but to adopt the attitude of command; not to guide people patiently and induce them to consciously and voluntarily accept Marxism, but to attempt to force people to accept Marxism. Conversely, the right mistake on this issue is to completely abandon the work of Marxist ideological education and adopt an attitude of appeasement, catering, and surrender towards bourgeois ideology.

    Therefore, to implement the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy, it is necessary to carry out a two-front struggle against both "left" dogmatism and right-leaning opportunism.

    3. What are your opinions on the article "Some Opinions on Current Literary and Art Work" co-authored by Comrades Chen Qitong and others? What are your opinions on the "Literary Gazette" commentator's article "The Gongs and Drums of Film"? What is the significance of criticizing these articles for carrying out "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend"?

    Answer: The article by Comrades Chen Qitong and others emphasizes that on the literary and art front, we should unswervingly adhere to the position of serving socialism and the people, and at the same time points out some phenomena in the current literary and art that are indeed worthy of attention, which is good and should be affirmed. However, this article contains some important errors. First, they made an incorrect assessment of the situation in literary and art circles after the proposal of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," failing to see the positive phenomena (which is the dominant aspect), and inappropriately exaggerating some secondary and individual negative phenomena. Second, even in terms of the negative phenomena they pointed out, their criticism also lacked analysis, and some phenomena are not, or at least not entirely, negative phenomena. For example, discussions on socialist realism, excavation and sorting out of traditional repertoires, an increase in works depicting family and love life, and satirical works cannot be said to be negative phenomena; although there are certain negative components, in terms of the main aspects, they are positive and healthy. Third, they did not adopt an attitude of reasoning towards the ideas they considered wrong, but adopted a simplistic and crude attitude. At a time when we are demanding to eliminate obstacles to "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" and encouraging everyone to "bloom" and "contend," this article actually played a role in hindering "blooming" and "contending." Because according to the examples cited in this article, only half a year after the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy was proposed, so many negative phenomena have emerged, so that reflected in literature and art, "the face of the times has become blurred, and the voice of the times has become low," then the inevitable logical conclusion would only be to take back this policy. Bloom, or take back? Faced with this urgent question, our authors made a wrong answer based on wrong judgments. The reason for this major error lies in the author's one-sided examination of the current literary and art situation; they observed things with dogmatic eyes and with sectarian emotions.

    If the article "Some Opinions on Current Literary and Art Work" reflects a "left" dogmatic tendency, then the article "The Gongs and Drums of Film" is a manifestation of right-leaning opportunism. The "Literary Gazette" commentator who wrote "The Gongs and Drums of Film" is the same author who published the article "For Progress" in the "Wenhui Daily" on January 4 under the pseudonym Zhu Zhuzhu. He is a comrade who has more contact with film work. If he could stand on the correct position, be realistic, and appropriately criticize the shortcomings and errors in film work, it would be beneficial. Unfortunately, he did not do so. His criticism adopted an attitude of obliterating everything, negating all the achievements of the film industry in the years since liberation. In the author's view, it seems that our film industry, from the content of the films to the production system, has no good points, and it seems that the more we emphasize the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers in film, the fewer the audience, and the more we strengthen leadership, the worse the film production becomes. Of course, our films must be loved by the audience, and the fact that some films cannot meet the needs of the masses must of course attract the serious attention of film workers. But the author here incorrectly raised the issue of "box office value." He said that our films have low "box office value." First, this is to cover up the whole with local facts; second, our works must be loved by the masses, but we must never pursue "box office value" without principle. We always put the role of film in educating the people first. The author, while emphasizing "box office value" and emphasizing the "tradition" of past films (undoubtedly, this tradition should be respected), lightly dismisses the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers in film. If this erroneous view develops without correction, there is a danger of leading our film industry onto the capitalist road. The author openly shouted the slogan "to regress," which does not seem to be accidental. This right-leaning opportunist theory of "regression" is obviously harmful.

    Criticizing "Some Opinions on Current Literary and Art Work" and criticizing "The Gongs and Drums of Film" is to criticize two kinds of ideological one-sidedness, to criticize the distortions of the Party's policy from the "left" and right, and this criticism is of great significance for implementing the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy and improving our thinking.

    4. What are your opinions on the film issue discussion conducted by our newspaper?

    Answer: I think the "Wenhui Daily's" film issue discussion is beneficial. The fact that film work has shortcomings and errors is an objective fact, and it did not exist only after the "Wenhui Daily" discussed it. Before the discussion, the leadership of the film industry had already noticed these issues and was prepared to carry out appropriate reforms. This discussion played a role in promoting the improvement of film work.

    Most of the opinions of film workers published in the newspaper are good. They reflected the shortcomings and problems existing in film work and put forward positive suggestions for improvement. As for saying that there are incorrect arguments in the discussion, since it is a discussion, there must be different arguments, both correct and wrong, and even in the same person's opinion, there may be both correct and wrong parts at the same time. This is not surprising. It cannot be required that every article published in the newspaper be correct. Correct or relatively correct conclusions can often only be reached after a full and free discussion of different opinions.

    5. How do you think we should further carry out "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" to make science and literature and art more prosperous?

    Answer: This requires carrying out work in many aspects.

    First, we must overcome "left" dogmatism and right-leaning opportunism, because they are the main obstacles to the current implementation of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend." On this point, much has already been said.

    Second, we must actively promote the study of Marxism among intellectuals and strengthen their ties with the working people. The development of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" will promote more intellectuals to accept and believe in Marxism on a conscious and voluntary basis, and at the same time will promote those who have initially acquired a Marxist worldview to further improve their level, be good at combining theory with practice, and creatively use and develop Marxism. Our scientists have initially formulated a twelve-year plan for the development of natural sciences and philosophy and social sciences, and writers have also formulated their own plans for going deep into the lives of the masses and creating works. The Party and the government will provide the broadest conditions to ensure the realization of these plans.

    Third, we must improve the Party's leadership over science and art work. To lead well, we must first rely on scientists and artists, cooperate well with them, trust them, consult with them on everything, and at the same time, leaders must learn to grasp the laws of science and art work. For us, the most important thing is to learn. We must learn from scientists and artists, because in terms of professional knowledge, they always know much more than we do. We cannot always remain ignorant, and even if we understand a little, we should not pretend to be experts and think we are great.

    The vast majority of our scientists and artists believe in our Party and are willing to accept the Party's leadership, but the subjectivism, sectarianism, and bureaucracy in leadership are not welcomed by them and are hated by them. As long as we earnestly overcome subjectivism, sectarianism, and bureaucracy, things will be easy to handle. This is true of all work. Science and art work is no exception.

专栏：

    就“百花齐放、百家争鸣”问题
    周扬同志答文汇报记者问
    陈其通等四位同志合写的“我们对目前文艺工作的几点意见”（刊于1月7日“人民日报”）一文发表以后，曾引起了学术界、文艺界的各种反应，并在实际上有碍于“百花齐放、百家争鸣”方针的贯彻。为了使知识界对这一发展科学、文艺的全面方针有更明确的认识，本报记者特访问了中共中央宣传部副部长周扬同志，就这一情况提出几个问题：
    （1）自从去年党中央提出“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的政策以来，在学术界、文艺界有什么重要收获？
    （2）你觉得在这几个月中“百花齐放”是不是放得够了？“百家争鸣”是不是鸣得够了？
     如果不够的话，你以为什么阻碍了“百花齐放、百家争鸣”政策的贯彻执行？
    （3）你对陈其通等四同志合写的“我们对目前文艺工作的几点意见”一文有什么意见？
     对文艺报评论员的“电影的锣鼓”一文又有什么意见？批评这些文章，对开展“百花齐放、百家争鸣”有什么意义？
    （4）你对我报所进行的电影问题讨论有什么意见？
    （5）你认为应该怎样进一步开展“百花齐放、百家争鸣”，使科学、文艺更加繁荣起来？
    下面是周扬同志对记者所提这些问题的答复：
    1、自从去年党中央提出“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的政策以来，在学术界、文艺界有什么重要收获？
    答：“百花齐放、百家争鸣”作为发展科学和艺术的全面方针提出来，还不到一年，在这样短暂的时间内，就要求有伟大的文艺作品和科学著作产生出来，当然为时尚早。但是这个方针提出以后所产生的积极效果却已经可以看出来。学术界自由讨论的风气浓厚起来了。一年来，关于遗传学，关于中国历史、中国哲学史，关于美学，关于文学艺术中的现实主义等等问题，都展开了不同意见的争辩。学术和文艺刊物大为增多，颇有“雨后春笋”之势。由于提倡“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，由于提倡“向科学进军”，去年出版的学术著作比从1950到1955六年内所出版的全部加起来还要多。剧目开放是戏曲界的一件大事。去年全国各地挖掘出了大量的传统剧目，其中不少剧目经过整理加工在舞台上重新取得了生命。文艺创作的取材范围比以前广阔得多了，体裁和风格也更多样化了。尖锐地揭露和批评生活中的消极现象的作品，愈来愈引起了人们的注目。所有这些，基本上都是好的，正常的，健康的现象。这是一种活跃和兴旺的气象。
    科学和艺术的发展需要有一种适合于它的环境。对于科学家和艺术家，社会主义社会的条件比资本主义社会的条件自然不知道要好多少倍。但是我们的环境中也还存在着一些不利于科学和艺术发展的东西，例如教条主义、宗派主义和对待科学艺术工作的官僚主义的行政命令的方法。有了这些东西，科学家、艺术家的积极性、主动性、创造性就会受到压抑、挫折，他们的研究和创作事业就会得不到应有的鼓励和支持。不少科学家和文艺工作者经过几年来的思想改造，开始摆脱了资产阶级唯心主义世界观的束缚，却又多多少少受到了教条主义的束缚。只有当我们的学术界摆脱了这两种束缚之后，他们的积极性才能在一个新的基础上得到发挥。“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，就把知识界的这种新的积极性鼓动起来了。大家开始重视独立思考和客观分析；不迷信，不盲从；敢于坚持自己正确的意见和反驳任何人的不正确的意见；敢于批判和揭露生活中的不合理的现象。科学和艺术是一种高度创造性的工作，需要有理论上的勇气和创作上的勇气。现在大家的勇气是比以前大得多了。当然，要产生伟大的艺术作品和科学著作，单有积极性和勇气还是不行，还需要有切实的刻苦的努力。科学家需要大量地占有材料，需要有正确的研究方法；艺术家需要有丰富的生活经验和表现技巧；这些都是不消说的。“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针使科学家、艺术家的积极性大大提高了，这就是最重要的收获。
    “百花齐放、百家争鸣”是一个有效地调动科学界和艺术界的一切积极因素来共同建设社会主义文化的政策。要调动积极因素，同时不可避免地也会出现一些消极因素。学术上的唯心主义思想，文艺中的资产阶级、小资产阶级倾向，对待遗产不分好坏不加区别地一概接受等等现象就都出现了。但这并没有甚么可怕。这是必然要有的现象，因为各种不同的思想都是一定社会存在的反映，它们是客观地存在着的。我们应该清醒地估计到，在我们的社会条件下，积极因素总是居于主导的优势的地位，而消极因素中有些东西在正确的政策下也可以转变为积极的东西，例如，封建文化和资本主义文化中的许多部分经过改造可以变成为适合人民需要的新文化，其中不能改造的部分，就会自然而然地被淘汰；从唯心主义者的哲学学说中也可以吸取若干合理的成分。同时，我们知道，真理只有和谬误斗争才能发展。我们不但要让人民看到真理、看到美的和善的东西，同时也要让人民了解甚么是谬误的、丑的和恶的东西。对于反面的事物，我们的任务不是禁止人民去接近，而是帮助人民去辨别真伪，美丑和善恶。我们相信人民的辨别力，相信唯物主义的力量，相信真理的力量；同时，我们要努力不断地提高人民的辨别力，不断地加强真理和谬误斗争的力量。
    2、你觉得在这几个月中“百花齐放”是不是放得够了？“百家争鸣”是不是鸣得够了？如果不够的话，你以为什么阻碍了“百花齐放、百家争鸣”政策的贯彻执行？
    答：“百花齐放、百家争鸣”是党的长期政策，根本不发生是否放得够了和鸣得够了的问题，因为没有一天能说是够的时候。即使到了共产主义社会，大多数人都具有了共产主义意识的时候，在学术上还会有各种不同意见的争论，在艺术上也还会有各种不同风格和流派的互相竞赛。科学上的许多旧的原理将不断地被新的原理所代替。文学艺术将不断地得到革新。正确和错误，先进和落后，将是人类生活中永远的矛盾。不过到了共产主义社会，人们意识中的资产阶级思想残余逐渐消灭，体力劳动和脑力劳动的区别逐渐消除，那时候，人人都具有相当广博的科学知识和艺术能力，学术上的垄断将成为不可想像的事，到了那时候，“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的局面自然就完全改观了。这是多少年以后的事，现在不必去说它吧。
      目前是什么东西阻碍了“百花齐放、百家争鸣”政策的贯彻执行呢？从思想倾向的角度来看，我们认为主要是两种思想上的片面性：“左”的教条主义和右倾机会主义的倾向。
    我们信奉马克思主义唯物主义，在文化上坚持为工农兵服务的方向。但是教条主义者和机会主义者却把这个和“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针对立起来。在教条主义者看来，似乎要马克思主义唯物主义，要工农兵方向，就不能同时要“百花齐放、百家争鸣”，至多只能口头上讲一讲，点缀点缀门面，他们对于这个方针实际上采取了一种怀疑、否定的态度。相反地，机会主义者对于“百花齐放、百家争鸣”方针倒是表示“欢迎”的，但他们是抱着另外一种心情来“欢迎”的，因为他们对马克思主义唯物主义、工农兵方向等等东西，早已有些厌倦了，现在既然有了新的方针，就可以理直气壮地把马克思主义、工农兵方向等等都当作甚么“教条主义”、“庸俗社会学”一古脑儿摔掉，好像不这样就会妨碍这个新的方针的执行似的，表面上看来似乎他们是在拥护这个方针，实际上他们是在葬送它，因为他们把这个方针的灵魂勾掉了。教条主义者和机会主义者都把肯定成绩和纠正缺点对立起来。所不同的是，教条主义者只许肯定成绩，不许批评缺点，实际上他们是在竭力保护缺点。相反，机会主义者在批评缺点的时候，却把成绩一概否定了。我们的态度是既要积极宣传马克思主义，又要贯彻执行“百花齐放、百家争鸣”方针；既要肯定成绩，又要坚决改正错误和缺点。
    对待思想问题的“左”的错误，是不采取说服的方法，而采取压服的方法；不采取说理的态度，而采取命令的态度；不是循循善诱地引导人家自觉自愿地接受马克思主义，而是企图强迫人家接受马克思主义。相反地，在这个问题上的右的错误则是根本放弃马克思主义思想教育的工作，对资产阶级思想，采取迁就、迎合、投降的态度。
    因此要贯彻执行“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，必须进行既反对“左”的教条主义，又反对右倾机会主义的两条战线的斗争。
    3、你对陈其通等四同志合写的“我们对目前文艺工作的几点意见”一文有什么意见？对文艺报评论员的“电影的锣鼓”一文又有什么意见？批评这些文章，对开展“百花齐放、百家争鸣”有什么意义？
    答：陈其通等四同志的文章，强调在文学艺术战线上应当毫不动摇地坚持为社会主义、为人民服务的立场，同时指出了目前文艺上的一些的确值得引起注意的现象，这是好的，应当肯定的。但这篇文章包含一些重要的错误。第一，他们对“百花齐放、百家争鸣”提出以后的文艺界的情况，作了不正确的估计，看不到积极现象（这是主导的方面），把一些次要的，个别的消极现象不适当地夸大了。第二，就以他们所指摘的消极现象而论，他们的批判也是缺乏分析的，而且有些现象并不是，至少不完全是消极现象，像关于社会主义现实主义的讨论，传统剧目的挖掘整理，描写家庭和爱情生活的作品和讽刺作品的增多，这些都不能说是消极现象；其中虽有某些消极成分，但就主要方面说，是积极的，健康的。第三，对待他们所认为错误的思想，不是采取说理的态度，而是采取简单化的，粗暴的态度。当现在正在要求排除“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的障碍、鼓励大家来“放”和“鸣”的时候，这篇文章实际上起了一种障碍“放”和“鸣”的作用。因为照这篇文章所举的例证看来，“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针提出来还不过半年多的时间，就产生了如此之多的消极现象，以致反映在文艺上，“时代的面貌模糊了，时代的声音低沉了”，那末，必然达到的逻辑的结论，就只有将这个方针收起来。放呢，还是收？在这个迫切的问题面前，我们的作者根据错误的判断作出了错误的回答。造成这个主要错误的原因就在作者对当前文艺状况的考察是片面的，他们是用教条主义的眼光，带着宗派的情绪去观察事物的。
    如果说“我们对当前文艺工作的几点意见”一文反映了一种“左”的教条主义的倾向的话，那么“电影的锣鼓”一文则是右倾机会主义的表现。写“电影的锣鼓”的“文艺报”评论员就是以朱煮竹的笔名在1月4日的“文汇报”上发表的“为了前进”一文的同一作者。他是一个和电影工作有较多接触的同志，他如果能够站在正确的立场，实事求是地，恰当地来批评电影工作中的缺点和错误，那是有好处的。可惜他没有那样作。他的批评采取了抹煞一切的态度，把解放几年来电影事业的成就全部否定了。照作者的眼光看来，似乎我们的电影事业，从影片的内容到制片的生产体制，没有一点好处，似乎我们越强调电影的工农兵方向，观众就越少，越加强领导，电影的生产就越糟。我们的电影当然要得到观众的爱好，某些影片不能满足群众的需要，这当然必须引起电影工作者的郑重的注意。但是作者在这里不正确地提出了一个“票房价值”的问题。他说我们的电影“票房价值”低，这第一，是以局部的事实掩盖了全体；第二，我们的作品要得到群众的爱好，但决不是无原则地去追求“票房价值”，我们总是把电影教育人民的作用放在第一位。作者在强调“票房价值”，强调过去电影的“传统”
  （无疑地这种传统是应当受到尊重的）的口实之下，轻轻一笔，就把电影的工农兵方向否定了，这种错误的观点如果发展下去而不加以纠正，就有将我们的电影事业引向资本主义道路的危险。作者公开叫出了“要倒退”的口号，看来并不是偶然的。这种右倾机会主义的“倒退”的理论，显然是有害的。
    批评“我们对目前文艺工作的几点意见”和批评“电影的锣鼓”，就是批评两种思想上的片面性，批评从“左”和右两方面来的对党的政策的歪曲，这种批评，对贯彻执行“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针和提高我们大家的思想都具有重要的意义。
    4、你对我报所进行的电影问题讨论有什么意见？
    答：我认为“文汇报”的电影问题讨论是有益处的。电影工作有缺点错误，是客观事实，并不是“文汇报”讨论了才有的。在讨论以前，电影事业的领导方面也已经注意到了这些问题，并且准备进行适当的改革。这个讨论对改进电影工作起了推动的作用。
    报上所发表的电影工作者的意见，大部分都是好的。他们反映了电影工作中存在的缺点和问题，并且提出了积极的改进意见。至于说讨论中有不正确的论点，既然是讨论，那就一定会有不同的论点，正确的和错误的都有，即使在同一个人的意见中也可能同时包含着正确和错误的部分。这是不足为奇的。不能要求报上刊登的每一篇文章的意见都正确。正确或比较正确的结论，往往只有在经过不同意见的充分的自由的讨论之后才能达到。
    5、你认为应该怎样进一步开展“百花齐放、百家争鸣”，使科学、文艺更加繁荣起来？
    答：这需要进行多方面的工作。
    首先，必须克服“左”的教条主义和右倾机会主义，因为它们是目前贯彻执行“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的主要障碍。关于这一点，前面已经说得很多了。
    其次，必须在知识分子中积极提倡学习马克思主义，加强他们和劳动人民的联系。“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的开展将促进更多的知识分子，在自觉自愿的基础上接受和信服马克思主义，同时将促使那些已初步具有马克思主义世界观的人，更进一步提高自己的水平，善于结合实际，创造性地运用和发展马克思主义。我国科学家们已初步制定了十二年内发展自然科学和哲学社会科学的规划，作家们也订出了各人的深入群众生活和创作的规划。党和政府将为保证实现这些规划提供最广泛的条件。
    第三，必须改善党对科学和艺术工作的领导。要领导得好，首先要依靠科学家、艺术家，要很好地和他们合作，信赖他们，遇事多和他们商量，同时，领导者要学会掌握科学和艺术工作的规律。对于我们来说，最重要的是学习。要向科学家、艺术家学，因为在业务上，他们总是比我们懂得多得多。我们不能老是不懂，懂了一点以后也不要冒充内行，自以为了不起。
    我们的科学家、艺术家绝大多数都是相信我们党，愿意接受党的领导的，可是领导上的主观主义、宗派主义、官僚主义却是他们所不欢迎的，他们所厌恶的。只要认真克服主观主义、宗派主义、官僚主义，事情就好办了。一切工作都是如此。科学和艺术工作也不例外。
