Xinhua News Agency, April 17th: The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress held its 65th enlarged meeting today, continuing to discuss work in education, agriculture, water conservancy, and political and legal affairs.

    This is the last enlarged meeting to discuss government work before deputies of the National People's Congress and members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Beijing begin their inspection work for the first half of the year.

    Prior to this, the Standing Committee held nine consecutive enlarged meetings, hearing work reports from six ministries, including the Ministry of Higher Education, and the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and extensively展开开展 developing discussions. During the discussions, deputies and members fully expressed their opinions. Everyone affirmed the significant achievements made in these areas of work, while also raising many criticisms and suggestions, as well as some problems existing in practical work.

    Some issues in education work particularly caught the attention of deputies and members. Many people criticized the shortcomings in compiling teaching materials. For example, some teaching materials were too heavy, some textbooks for primary, middle, and high schools had repetitive content and lacked continuity, some selections were inappropriate, and there was too much and too deep classical literature in the textbooks. Gao Chongmin said at the meeting that his child was already reading "Zhuangzi" and "The Book of Songs" in junior high school, and he requested that relevant departments carefully study this issue. Zheng Yun, an old education worker, said that the current primary school Chinese lessons were too heavy. Previously, first and second-grade students in elementary school were required to learn 300 characters, but now they are required to learn 1,500 characters. Many teachers have raised concerns about such a heavy teaching load, but the education department refuses to accept them. She suggested that the Ministry of Education should uniformly lead the work of compiling textbooks.

    Qian Weichang and Lu Dingyi also criticized the shortcomings and errors in education work. Qian Weichang said that there are currently two important questions in education work: "What to teach" and "Who should teach." He said that in terms of teaching materials, many were too heavy, and it was too much of an underestimation to entrust such an important task to an education publishing house to complete. On the issue of teachers, it was necessary to pay attention to the development of quantity in the past, but in the future, more attention should be paid to the improvement of quality, and what kind of person should be asked to do what kind of thing. He hoped that the education department should pay good attention to China's existing teaching experience, and it was wrong to ignore past experience.

    Lu Dingyi said at the meeting that education work has achieved great results in recent years, which is mainly due to the superiority of our social system, and the efforts of education workers should not be ignored. However, we should not conceal our difficulties and errors. He said that there is serious bureaucracy and subjectivism in the leadership work of the education department. They do not pay attention to consulting with old education workers with rich teaching experience when handling affairs, and some people even act arbitrarily. For example, there are very serious shortcomings and errors in the problem of compiling general education textbooks. He demanded that the education department should rely more on old education workers in the future, listen more to the opinions of various schools and local leading organs, and resolutely overcome the bureaucratic style of work.

    In terms of agricultural and water conservancy work, deputies and members paid particular attention to the particularly low agricultural product yields in the five provinces of Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and Shaanxi. Zhu Kezhen cited facts to illustrate the serious soil erosion in Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces. He said that it is estimated that the amount of fertilizer lost in these two provinces in a year is more than the amount of fertilizer produced and imported in China in a year. He suggested that the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Water Conservancy should pay attention to this issue. Qian Changzhao also expressed his views on this issue, saying that there is not enough water for farmland irrigation on the North China Plain, and even if the Sanmenxia Reservoir is built and the Han River is diverted, it cannot completely solve this problem. He suggested that the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Water Conservancy, and the Ministry of Geology should first clarify the situation of groundwater in North China.

    Huang Shaohong, Shao Lizi, Hou Debang, Li Shucheng and others also raised inquiries, criticisms, and suggestions on agricultural and water conservancy work. Huang Shaohong said that according to what he saw during his inspection in Guangxi, there have been droughts in Guangxi for several years, and they are very serious. Some places even have difficulties in drinking water. He suggested that relevant departments should consider whether the method of digging wells in the north can also be promoted in Guangxi. Huang Shaohong also mentioned that some places have falsely reported agricultural output, and he asked the Ministry of Agriculture to pay attention to this issue.

    Deputies and members expressed many opinions on political and legal work. Everyone agreed that the significant decrease in criminal and civil cases tried by the courts in 1956 demonstrated the enormous progress of society, especially due to the victory of socialist transformation, which fundamentally changed the relations of production. This is the foundation for eradicating social crime. However, deputies and members believed that this situation should not cause the state organs to be the slightest bit relaxed and麻痹paralyzed. In particular, American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique are still constantly sending special agents to the mainland, and the remaining counter-revolutionaries in the country have not been completely eliminated. At the same time, in some places, due to the relaxation of political and ideological education for cadres and the masses, and the neglect of education on abiding by the law, criminal phenomena are still very serious in some places.

    At the meeting, many people cited situations they saw during inspection work, criticizing the judicial organs for not being resolute and forceful enough in the struggle to combat criminal elements, and some were shrinking back. Everyone demanded that the judicial organs should resolutely take measures to combat criminal elements in order to ensure the smooth progress of socialist construction. Huang Yanpei also suggested that the Standing Committee may consider establishing a special group or absorbing relevant judicial departments to jointly study the issue of criminal crime.

    Some people suggested that in order to reduce and eliminate social crime phenomena, in addition to taking legal measures, publicity and education should be strengthened for the people, and appropriate arrangements should be made for some unemployed people.

    Xu Guangping revealed at the meeting some intolerable criminal phenomena of insulting women and abusing young girls. She demanded that the judicial organs strictly enforce the law against these criminals, and at the same time vigorously strengthen moral character education in society.

    Huang Shaohong said in his speech that in order to eliminate criminal crime phenomena, the crimes of a small number of civil servants, Communist Party members, members of democratic parties, and members of the Communist Youth League in state organs should be handled seriously and promptly, and should not be dragged on. Only in this way can people in society be vigilant. Huang Shaohong also raised inquiries about some serious cases discovered during the inspection and requested that relevant agencies conduct investigations.

    At the meeting, the heads of relevant government departments answered nearly thirty questions raised by deputies and members. Vice Minister of Public Security Wang Jinxiang answered questions about labor re-education. Vice Minister of Water Conservancy Li Baohua answered questions about investigating groundwater in North China and water conservancy in Hebei Province. The heads of the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Higher Education, and the Ministry of Agriculture also answered relevant questions one by one at the meeting, and some conducted further inspections based on the criticisms raised at the meeting. Vice Minister of Education Dong Chuncai talked about the situation of students' excessive burden in schools and opinions on changing this situation, and especially examined the subjective and bureaucratic style of work in the leadership of the Ministry of Education. Minister of Higher Education Yang Xiufeng talked about the shortcomings of emphasizing unification and excessive restrictions in the leadership work of the Ministry of Higher Education. He proposed that in the future, more power should be given to universities to give play to the schools' creativity and allow each school to create its own unique style. Vice Minister of Agriculture Liu Ruilong answered questions about soil and water conservation in the five provinces of North China, developing cotton production in Xinjiang and the Hexi Corridor in Gansu, and mobilizing demobilized soldiers and middle and high school graduates to return to agriculture. Liu Ruilong said that the comrades of the Ministry of Agriculture were very excited and believed that the discussions and criticisms of the enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee were a great inspiration, a great impetus, and a great support for agricultural work.

    The ministers also asked the Standing Committee to regularly inspect and criticize the work of the government in the future, and hoped that deputies of the National People's Congress and members of the CPPCC National Committee could discover more shortcomings and problems in their inspections in various places and urge various government departments to improve their work.

    全国人民代表大会常委会连续举行扩大会
    广泛讨论和检查政府工作
    各有关部门负责人当场答复所提出的问题
    新华社17日讯　全国人民代表大会常务委员会今日全天举行第六十五次会议扩大会，继续讨论教育、农业、水利、政法等方面的工作。
    这是在京的全国人民代表大会代表和政协全国委员会委员开始今年上半年的视察工作以前最后一次讨论政府工作的扩大会。
    在这以前，常务委员会连续举行了九次扩大会，先后听了高等教育等六个部和最高人民法院、最高人民检察院的工作报告，并广泛地展开了讨论。在讨论中，代表和委员们充分发表了意见，大家肯定这几方面工作所取得的重大成绩，同时提出了许多批评和建议以及实际工作中存在的一些问题。
    教育工作方面的一些问题特别引起了代表们和委员们的注意。许多人批评了教材编写方面的缺点，例如有些教材分量太重、大、中、小学有些课本内容重复、互不衔接、有的选材不适当、课本里的古典文学太多太深。高崇民在会上说，他的孩子现在在初中就已经读起“庄子”、“诗经”了，他要求有关部门很好地研究这个问题。老教育工作者郑芸说，现在小学语文课分量太重，从前要求初级小学一二年级学生学会三百字，现在要求学会一千五百字，许多教师对这样重的教学分量提出意见，但教育部门不肯接受。她建议教育部要统一领导编订教科书的工作。
    钱伟长和陆定一也就教育工作方面的缺点和错误提出了批评。钱伟长说，目前教育工作中存在“教什么”和“谁来教”两个重要的问题。他说，在教材方面很多教材的分量都重了，把这样一件重要的事情交给一个教育出版社去完成，是太轻视它了。在教师的问题上，过去注意数量的发展是必要的，今后应该更注意质量的提高，什么样的人应该叫他做什么样的事。他希望教育部门应该很好重视中国已有的教学经验，忽视过去的经验是不对的。
    陆定一在会上说，几年来教育工作取得了很大成绩，当然这主要是由于我们社会制度的优越，同时也不应抹煞教育工作者的努力。但是，我们不应隐讳我们的困难和错误。他说，教育部门的领导工作中存在严重的官僚主义和主观主义，他们办事不注意同有丰富教学经验的老教育工作者商量，有的人甚至一意孤行，比方编写普通教育教材的问题就有很严重的缺点和错误。他要求今后教育部门应该多依靠老教育工作者，多听取各学校和各地方领导机关的意见，坚决克服官僚主义作风。
    在农业和水利工作方面，代表和委员们特别注意晋、冀、鲁、豫、陕五省农产品产量特别低的情况。竺可桢列举事实说明山西、陕西两省水土流失的严重情况。他说，据估计这两个省一年流失的肥料比我国一年生产和进口的肥料还多。他建议农业部和水利部都应该重视这个问题。钱昌照也就这个问题发表了意见，他说，华北平原的农田灌溉用水是不够的，即便修建了三门峡水库和引用汉水，也不能完全解决这个问题。他建议农业部、水利部和地质部目前首先应该把华北地下水的情况弄清楚。
    黄绍竑、邵力子、侯德榜、李书城等人也都对农业和水利工作提出了询问、批评和建议。黄绍竑说，据他在广西视察所见，广西几年来都有旱灾，而且很严重，有的地方群众吃水都有困难，他建议有关部门应考虑是否在广西地方也可推行北方打井的办法。黄绍竑还谈到有的地方有虚报农业产量的情况，他请农业部注意这个问题。
    代表们和委员们对于政法工作发表了很多的意见。大家一致认为，1956年法院审理的刑事和民事案件的显著下降，说明了社会的巨大进步，特别由于社会主义改造的胜利，生产关系起了根本的变化，这是铲除社会犯罪现象的基础。但是，代表们和委员们认为这种情况不应该使国家机关有丝毫的松懈和麻痹，特别美国帝国主义和蒋介石集团还在不断地向大陆派遣特务分子，国内的残余反革命分子也还没有全部肃清，同时在有些地方由于放松了向干部和人民群众进行政治思想教育，忽视了遵守法律的教育，刑事犯罪现象在一些地方还是非常严重的。
    会上，许多人列举视察工作中所见到的情况，批评了司法机关在打击刑事犯罪分子的斗争中还不够坚决有力，有些缩手缩脚。大家要求司法机关应该坚决采取措施，打击刑事犯罪分子，以保障社会主义建设事业的顺利进行。黄炎培还建议常务委员会可考虑专门成立一个小组或者吸收有关司法部门来共同研究刑事犯罪的问题。
    有的人建议，要减少和肃清社会犯罪现象，除了采取法律措施以外，还应该对人民群众加强宣传教育，同时对一些无业的人给予适当安排。
    许广平在会上揭发了一些侮辱妇女、摧残幼女的不可容忍的犯罪现象。她要求司法机关对这些犯罪分子严肃地执行法律，同时要在社会上大力加强道德品质的教育。
    黄绍竑在发言中提出，为了肃清刑事犯罪现象，对一少部分国家机关的公务人员、共产党员、民主党派成员和青年团员的犯罪，应该严肃地及早处理，不要拖拖拉拉。只有这样才能使社会上的人有所警惕。黄绍竑还就视察中所发现的一些严重案件提出了询问，要求有关机关进行调查。
    会上，政府有关部门的负责人答复了代表和委员们提出的将近三十个问题。公安部副部长汪金祥答复了关于劳动教养的问题。水利部副部长李葆华答复了关于调查华北地下水和河北省水利等问题。教育部、高等教育部和农业部的负责人也都在会上逐项答复了有关的问题，有的并根据会上提出的批评作了进一步的检查。教育部副部长董纯才谈到了学校学生负担过重的情况以及改变这种情况的意见，并特别检查了教育部领导工作中的主观主义和官僚主义的作风。高等教育部部长杨秀峰谈到高等教育部领导工作中强调统一　限制过死的缺点。他提出，今后要更多地给高等学校一些权力，发挥学校的创造性，允许各学校创造自己独特的风格。农业部副部长刘瑞龙在会上答复了华北五省水土保持和在新疆、甘肃河西走廊发展棉花生产，以及动员复员军人、中小学毕业生决心归农等问题。刘瑞龙说，农业部的同志很兴奋，认为常务委员会扩大会的讨论和批评，对农业工作是很大的启发、很大的督促和很大的支持。
    部长们还要求常务委员会今后能够经常检查和批评政府的工作，并希望全国人民代表大会代表和政协委员到各地视察时，能够更多地发现工作中的缺点和问题，督促政府各部门改进工作。
