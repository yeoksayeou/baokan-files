Sino-Soviet Brotherly Friendship is a Great Inspiring Force
The Whole Soviet Union Spreads News of the Grand Welcome for Comrade Voroshilov in China
　　(Our newspaper, Moscow, April 27th) Reporter Li He reports: During Chairman Voroshilov's visit to China, the Sino-Soviet friendship felt as warm as the spring sunshine. This is the impression gained from conversations with Soviet people.
　　At the Likhachev Automobile Factory, the reporter met grinder Kurkin and forger Sustretdov. They had attended the National Congress of Advanced Producers in Beijing. Kurkin said: "The Chinese leaders and people welcomed Voroshilov so warmly that we felt the Chinese people's sincere gratitude for the Soviet people's selfless assistance, and we felt even more that the friendship between our two peoples is very natural and very solid." Sustretdov said: "Comrade Voroshilov's visit is a great thing, it will strengthen the friendship between the people of our two great countries." These two advanced workers demonstrated operational techniques in major cities in China. A worker from a machine manufacturing factory in Shenyang wrote to Kurkin saying: "He learned Kurkin's operating methods and became an advanced producer. Kurkin promised to send him professional books. Kurkin believes: "The exchange of advanced experience between Chinese and Soviet workers is a major event. Everyone tells each other their experiences without any reservations. This is a particularly friendly moment, at this moment our friendship is 'welded' together. It is necessary to develop communication between workers, and letters can not only talk about private matters, but also talk about production, learn from each other, and help each other.” Sustretdov also believes:
　　"It would be great to constantly exchange worker delegations and exchange advanced experiences. When we were in China, we not only taught Chinese comrades, but also learned a lot from them.”
　　At the Institute of Methodology of the Russian Federation Academy of Educational Sciences, the reporter met Monoson, Corresponding Academician and Deputy Director of the Institute. He said: “Like the Chinese people, the Soviet people regard Voroshilov's visit to China as a clear manifestation of the increasing strength of our friendship. Everyone is happy to read the reports of the warm welcome he received. We hope that his visit will further strengthen Sino-Soviet friendship.” Monoson visited China last year. In his opinion, the speed of educational development in China in the past seven years is rare in the world, although there are still difficulties. He said: In order to enhance friendship, Chinese and Soviet educators have agreed to systematically exchange delegations, exchange educational books, and strengthen ties between schools and research institutes. He said: “It is necessary to exchange lectures frequently. I gave lectures in China, and I feel that it would be great if Chinese scholars gave lectures to Soviet teachers.”
　　Lecturer Pankov of the Lenin Pedagogical Institute said as soon as we met: “My language is not enough to express my gratitude to the Chinese people for welcoming Voroshilov so warmly. I am very happy that there is such a strong force of friendship linking our two peoples together.”
　　(Our newspaper, Voroshilovgrad, April 27th) Peter Kovenyev, leader of the fitter team at the October Revolution Oil Engine Locomotive Factory, said: The enthusiastic and sincere welcome given to Comrade Voroshilov and his entourage everywhere in China made every Soviet person very happy. All the workers in our factory and all the laborers in Voroshilov City are paying attention to Voroshilov's visit, which is understandable. Voroshilov's name is connected with the revolutionary struggle of the proletariat in this city. March marked the fifty-second anniversary of the political general strike held by workers in this city, which was led by the party organization headed by Voroshilov, who was working in our factory at that time. In order to prevent the enemy from destroying our constructive labor, we must tirelessly consolidate the unity of the people of the two great countries of China and the Soviet Union. Voroshilov's visit is for this noble cause. Our fraternal friendship inspires the Soviet people to create new and unprecedented feats for the happiness of the people of the two countries and the bright future of all mankind.
　　(Our newspaper, Leningrad, April 27th) Lenin Prize winner and Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences D.V. Nalivkin said: All Soviet people have been happily reading reports of Chairman Voroshilov's visit to China these days. This visit once again proves that the ties between our countries and peoples are inseparable. The close ties between Chinese and Soviet scientists enrich our knowledge of each other. The Chinese and Soviet people, who have established people's political power, have become the masters of their countries' countless wealth. The Soviet Union has extremely rich natural resources. I have spent many years of my life drawing geological maps of the Soviet Union. I won the Lenin Prize for leading the drawing of the 1:2,500,000 geological map of the Soviet Union (according to the Minister of Geology of the Soviet Union, a copy of this map has been sent to our country). When drawing this map, I repeatedly consulted Chinese geologists, because many problems cannot be solved without considering the achievements of Chinese geology. I received the necessary materials from Chinese comrades. I am deeply grateful for this great help. Our friendship is a great force that helps our people move smoothly towards communism.
　　(Our newspaper, Molotov, April 27th) Yu. Timkin, representative of the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet and foreman of the open-hearth furnace workshop of the Chuchuvoi Iron and Steel Plant, said: The workers in the Urals are paying close attention to Chairman Voroshilov's activities in China. In this visit, we saw a new manifestation of the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people. In May last year, I had the honor of participating in the National Congress of Advanced Producers in China. I saw in Anshan that the Chinese comrades absorbed the good experience of the Soviet steel workers and enriched it. Now I know from Voroshilov's speech that the Anshan steel workers have made new achievements, and I am encouraged by this. There are many Chinese comrades in the Urals who are interning, and we are very willing to pass on our experience and consolidate our friendship.
　　(Our newspaper, Barnaul, April 27th) Fu. Korobizhen, chairman of the trade union of the "Komsomol" state farm established on the new land in the Altai Territory, said: "We are paying attention to the sincere welcome given to Voroshilov by the workers in Beijing, Anshan, Shenyang, Shanghai and other places. The people of our two countries are brothers. Our friendship is permanent and unbreakable.” The "Komsomol" state farm has received Chinese guests, and Korobizhen participated in the construction of our country's "Friendship" state farm. He said: “Chinese comrades today are holding the hands of Soviet representatives tightly, expressing true love for the Soviet people. No one can pull apart this brotherly handshake at any time, and no one can destroy our brotherly relationship."
　　(Our newspaper, Chelyabinsk, April 27th) De. Kuriyanov, a steelworker at the Chelyabinsk Iron and Steel Plant, said: We are sincerely happy that our Chinese friends, especially the workers of Anshan Iron and Steel, welcomed Chairman Voroshilov so warmly. This is how true friends meet. Voroshilov's visit will further consolidate the unity of the people of our two countries. Many Chinese interns come to our factory. We pass on our experience to them as friends. In the future, we are prepared to continue to have production ties with our Chinese comrades.

    中苏兄弟友谊是伟大的鼓舞力量
    全苏传诵我国欢迎伏老盛况
    本报莫斯科27日电　记者李何报道：在伏罗希洛夫主席访问我国的这些日子里，中苏友谊就像春天的阳光那样温暖。这是同苏联人谈话中得到的感觉。
    在利哈乔夫汽车制造厂，记者会见了磨工库尔金和锻工苏斯特列多夫。他们曾到北京列席过我国全国先进生产者代表会议。库尔金说：“中国领导人员和人民那样热烈地迎接伏罗希洛夫，使我们感到中国人民由衷地感谢苏联人民的无私援助，使我们更加觉得我们两国人民之间的友谊是十分自然的，是非常牢固的。”苏斯特列多夫说：“伏罗希洛夫同志的访问是件大好事，它将加强我们两大国人民之间的友谊。”这两位先进工人在我国大城市表演过操作技术。沈阳一个机器制造厂的工人写信给库尔金说：“他学会了库尔金的操作方法，成为先进生产者。库尔金答应给他寄去专业书籍。库尔金认为：“中苏工人交流先进经验是件大事。大家毫无隐秘地倾腹相告自己的经验，这是一种特别的友好时刻，在这个时刻里我们的友谊‘焊接’起来了。需要发展工人之间的通讯关系，书信里不光谈私事，也可以谈生产，互相请教，彼此帮助。”苏斯特列多夫也认为：
  “要是不断地交换工人代表团，交流先进经验，那太好了。我们在中国的时候不单教中国同志，也从他们那里学到许多东西。”
    在俄罗斯联邦教育科学院的教授法研究所里，记者会见了这个研究所的副所长蒙诺桑通讯院士。他说：“苏联人民像中国人民一样，把伏罗希洛夫的访问中国，看作我们的友谊日益加强的显明表现。大家高兴地读到热烈迎接他的报道。我们愿望他的访问将进一步加强中苏友谊”。蒙诺桑去年到过我国。据他的见解，中国教育七年来发展的速度，在世界上是罕有的，虽然还有困难。他说：为了增进友谊，中苏教育工作者谈妥了有计划地交换代表团，交换教育方面的书籍，加强学校研究所之间的联系。他说：“需要经常交换讲学。我在中国作过讲演，感到如果有中国学者向苏联教师们讲演，那是多么好啊。”
    列宁教育学院讲师潘科夫一见面就说：“我的语言不足以表达对中国人民的感激，他们那样热烈地欢迎伏罗希洛夫。我很高兴，有这样强大的友谊力量把我们两国人民联系起来。”
    本报伏罗希洛夫格勒27日电十月革命油机机车制造厂钳工组长彼得·科维涅夫说：中国到处热烈地诚恳地迎接伏罗希洛夫同志和他的随行人员，使每个苏联人非常高兴。我厂全体工人，伏罗希洛夫市的全体劳动者，都注意伏罗希洛夫的访问，这是可以理解的。伏罗希洛夫的名字和本市无产阶级的革命斗争联系着。3月间是本市工人举行政治总罢工的五十二年，它是由以伏罗希洛夫为首的党组织领导的，当时伏罗希洛夫在我厂做工。为了使敌人不能够破坏我们的建设性劳动，必须不倦地巩固中苏两大国人民的团结。伏罗希洛夫的访问就是为了这崇高的事业。我们的兄弟般的友谊，鼓舞苏联人为两国人民的幸福和全人类的光明未来而创造新的空前的功绩。
    本报列宁格勒27日电　列宁奖金获得者、苏联科学院院士德·维·纳利夫金说：所有苏联人在这些日子里，都欢欣地阅读伏罗希洛夫主席访问中国的报道。这次访问又一次证明，我们的国家和人民的联系是不可分离的。中苏科学家的密切联系，使我们彼此的知识更丰富起来。建立了人民政权的中苏人民，成为自己国家无数财富的主人。苏联拥有极丰富的自然资源。我把一生的许多年用在绘制苏联地质一览图上。由于我领导绘制了二百五十万分之一的苏联地质图（据苏联地质部部长谈，此图已送给我国一份），获得了列宁奖金。在绘制这个地图时，我屡次向中国地质学家请教，因为许多问题如果不考虑中国地质学的成就，是不能解决的。我从中国同志那里得到必需的材料。我深深感谢这种巨大的帮助，我们的友谊是伟大的力量，它帮助我们人民顺利地走向共产主义。
    本报莫洛托夫27日电　俄罗斯联邦最高苏维埃代表、楚却沃伊钢铁厂平炉车间工长尤·季木金说：乌拉尔劳动者非常注意伏罗希洛夫主席在中国的活动。在这次访问中，我们看到了中苏人民牢不可破的友谊的新的表现。我在去年5月荣幸地参加过中国全国先进生产者代表会议，在鞍钢看到中国同志吸收了苏联炼钢工人的好经验，并且丰富了它。现在我在伏罗希洛夫的讲话中知道了鞍钢炼钢工人又取得新的成绩，我为之鼓舞。在乌拉尔有不少中国同志在实习，我们非常愿意传授我们的经验，巩固我们的友谊。
    本报巴尔纳乌尔27日电　在阿尔泰边疆新地上建立的“共青团”国营农场工会主席甫·柯罗比真说：“我们注意北京、鞍山、沈阳、上海等地劳动者诚意地迎接伏罗希洛夫。我们两国人民是兄弟。我们的友谊是永久的、牢不可破的。”“共青团”国营农场接待过中国的客人，而柯罗比真参加过我国“友谊”国营农场的建设。他说：“中国同志们今天紧紧地握着苏联代表们的手，表示对苏联人民的真正的友爱。无论什么人在任何时候都不能拉开这个兄弟的握手，不能破坏我们兄弟的关系。”
    本报车里雅宾斯克27日电　车里雅宾斯克钢铁厂炼钢工人德·库里雅诺夫说：中国朋友特别是鞍钢职工那样热烈地迎接伏罗希洛夫主席，使我们由衷地高兴。真正的朋友是这样会面的。伏罗希洛夫的访问将更加巩固我们两国人民的团结。许多中国的实习生到我们工厂来。我们像对待朋友一样把经验传授给他们。今后我们准备继续同中国同志们发生生产上的联系。
