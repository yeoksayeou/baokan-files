    Please Open the Door Quickly!
    Fan Ming
    A friend came from afar, and upon meeting, immediately offered criticism: "Your housing is really special! You don't use the front door, you use the back door. Not only is the front door locked, but there's also a barbed wire fence outside."
    Originally, when I first moved in, I also felt awkward; but as time went on, especially after seeing that many residential areas abandoned their front doors, all surrounded by barbed wire, I got used to it. But after my friend mentioned it, I felt awkward again.
    Those who advocate for putting up barbed wire fences and locking gates in residential areas haven't held a press conference to explain their policies, but they have posted notices announcing their reasons. The four-story building in the Fourth Residential Area of the Ministry of Railways, where I live, has one such notice posted inside the front door, which reads: "For the safety of residents, this door is not to be opened." Below it is a padlock, solemn and formidable.
    I don't know how much others have paid for this "safety," but I can only talk about my own feelings. I live on the first floor, and if I use the front door, I don't have to climb stairs; but if I use the back door, I have to climb up from the basement. When I moved in, I had to carry boxes and luggage, climbing the stairs dozens of times. Roughly calculating, in railway terms, the travel distance increased by 200%, and the labor intensity also increased by 200%, but the charged ton-kilometers didn't increase at all. Doing twice the work for half the result, as they say.
    The problem isn't just this waste of 200%; it also seems to involve our attitude towards life. Like many middle-aged people with experience of life in the old society, we often believe in the motto "You can't have a heart to deceive others, but you can't be without a heart to guard against others"; we always like to build a line of defense between ourselves and others, otherwise we feel insecure. Locking the gate and putting up barbed wire fences around the residence are probably also determined by this kind of thinking on the part of the comrades who manage the residences. They don't see the profound changes in our society, but they smear a dismal color on the new picture of our society. If a photo of such a residential area were published in a newspaper to introduce the development of civil architecture, readers would probably protest: a house with no one entering or leaving, surrounded by barbed wire, can it be pleasing to the eye?
    Generally speaking, people who intentionally or unintentionally reveal an air of "be careful with fire" are never likable; such people find it difficult to gain sincere friendship and difficult to enjoy the pleasure of a frank and trusting relationship between people. Locking the door, others can't come in, and you can't get out, you can only peep at the world from the glass window, and unknowingly, your vision becomes increasingly narrow. Please remove the lock and open the door! The gentle breeze and bright sunshine, singing birds and fragrant flowers are waiting for you outside.

    请把门儿快打开！
    凡明
    有朋自远方来，一见面就提意见：“你们住的房子真特别！正门不走，走后门。正门上锁还不算，门外还拉上一道铁丝网。”
    本来，刚刚搬进来的时候，我也感觉到别扭；日子长了，特别是看见不少的住宅区都是舍正门而弗由，周围都拉上铁丝网，也就习惯了。经这位朋友一提，重新觉得确实有点别扭。
    主张在住宅区拉铁丝网、锁大门的人，没有举行过记者招待会来说明他们的施政方针，但却贴过布告宣布理由。我所住的铁道部第四住宅区的那座四层楼，正门里边就贴了一张，上写：“为了住户安全，此门不开。”下面是一把铁锁，庄严可畏。
    我不知道别人为了这种“安全”付出过多少代价，只能谈谈自己的感受。我住在一楼，如果走正门，用不着爬楼梯；但是要走后门，就必须从地下室往上爬。搬进来的时候，我不能不一次又一次地扛着箱子、行李，爬了十几次楼梯。大致计算一下，用铁路用语来说，走行距离增加200％，劳动强度也增加了200％，而计费吨公里却一点也没有增长。事倍功半，此之谓也。
    问题还不只是在于这种白白耗费的200％；似乎还可以牵涉到我们对生活的态度。像我们有着在旧社会生活经验的中年人，很多人信奉“欺人之心不可有、防人之心不可无”的信条；总是喜欢在人我之间筑上一条防线，否则就觉得不安全。锁大门、在住宅外面拉铁丝网，大约也是管理住宅的同志的这种思想所决定的。他们看不见我们社会的深刻的变革，却在我们社会的新图景上，抹了一笔灰溜溜的颜色。如果在这样的住宅区拍一张照片登在报上，以介绍民用建筑的发展情况，读者们大概会提出抗议的：没有人进出的、外面围着铁丝网的房子，能够令人眼睛舒服么？
    大凡有意或无意流露出“火烛小心”的神气的人，总是不会令人喜欢的；这样的人很难得到真诚的友谊，很难享受到人与人之间坦然相处、互相信任的乐趣。把门锁住，别人进不来，自己也出不去，只能从玻璃窗内窥探世界，不知不觉，眼光日益短浅。还是请你把锁去掉，把门打开吧！门外的和风丽日，语鸟香花等待着你。
