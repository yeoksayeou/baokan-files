Our country's agricultural and water conservancy construction undertakings
Receive great assistance from the Soviet People

    This newspaper reports: The Soviet Union's multifaceted friendly assistance to our country's agriculture is blossoming and bearing fruit on our vast land.

    The State-run Friendship Farm, which the Soviet government helped our country build in 1954, is now rapidly growing on the fertile North Manchurian Plain. In 1956, this farm planted 381,390 mu of wheat, soybeans, corn, and rice, all of which yielded good harvests, and turned over more than 67 million jin of commodity grain to the state throughout the year. The Soviet experts at this farm not only completed the land planning for the Friendship Farm, but also trained hundreds of technical cadres in land planning for our country, laying the groundwork for our country to establish scientific land planning and wasteland surveying. This is of great significance for our country's future large-scale reclamation of wasteland and construction of state-run farms.

    The first batch of agricultural machinery tractor stations established in various parts of our country have received much help from the Soviet Union in terms of equipment, technology, and management. When our country began to pilot agricultural machinery stations, the Soviet Union supplied us with a large number of agricultural machines, and Soviet experts enthusiastically helped many agricultural machinery stations formulate regulations and prepare for the construction of machine repair plants, enabling these newborn socialist agricultural enterprises to quickly embark on a sound development path.

    During the severe locust plagues in the Xinjiang region from 1953 to 1955, the Soviet government sent locust extermination teams for three consecutive years, dispatching a large number of aircraft to carry out large-scale locust extermination in the locust areas of Xinjiang, effectively protecting the vast farmland and grassland of the pastoral areas in this region. Since last year, our country has been able to basically control the locust damage in Xinjiang. In recent years, the Soviet Union has also sent plant protection experts to help our country train plant quarantine cadres and carry out plant protection work.

    The Soviet Union has also provided much assistance to our country in terms of crop cultivation techniques and livestock breeding, as well as in the promotion of improved crop varieties and livestock breeds.

    The formulation of our country's twelve-year long-term plan for agricultural scientific research and the preparation for the establishment of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences have also received strong assistance from Soviet scientific institutions.

    Furthermore, Soviet water conservancy experts have made outstanding contributions to China's water conservancy construction.

    Many of the huge water conservancy projects that have been completed and are under construction in the years since liberation have had Soviet experts participating in and providing technical guidance from surveying and design to construction. Among the design and construction units of the Sanmenxia Water Control Project, which officially started construction recently, there are currently thirteen Soviet experts led by Comrade Korolev, the chief design engineer of this project, who are carrying out their work. A series of large reservoirs in the Huai River basin, the Guanting Reservoir in the Yongding River basin, the Dahuo房 Reservoir in the Liao River basin, the Dujiatai Flood Diversion Project in the Han River basin, the Sheyang Port Sluice in coastal Jiangsu Province, and other projects that have been completed and are under construction are also being built with the enthusiastic assistance of Soviet experts. At present, the Soviet expert group of the Ministry of Water Conservancy is also helping our country carry out surveying and design of large reservoirs on the Yi River and Luo River, tributaries of the Yellow River.

    In the comprehensive planning of large river basins, we have received strong assistance from Soviet experts from the very beginning. With the direct assistance of Soviet scientists, our country completed the comprehensive plan for the Yellow River basin in the first half of 1955. Since 1955, the basin planning for the Yangtze River, our country's largest river, has begun. Currently, a Soviet expert group led by Comrade Dimitrievsky is helping our country to compile the essentials of this extremely complex basin plan. Comrade Dimitrievsky is the most prestigious and experienced water conservancy expert in the Soviet Union, and the Angara River basin plan in eastern Soviet Union was carried out under his leadership. Now, this old expert, who is over sixty years old, is contributing his wisdom to benefit the Chinese people. The basin planning for the Qiantang River in Zhejiang Province began in the first quarter of this year, and several Soviet experts have already gone to Hangzhou to help carry out this work.

    Valuable assistance has also been received from Soviet experts in small-scale farmland water conservancy construction. A few years ago, Soviet water conservancy experts introduced rational irrigation methods in our country – furrow irrigation and planned water use. These two advanced irrigation methods have begun to be implemented in some irrigation areas. The long-term and severe water shortage in the pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia directly threatens the development of animal husbandry. The Soviet experts of the Ministry of Water Conservancy are very concerned about this issue. Since last year, they have been repeatedly studying it and have now put forward suggestions for solving the technical problems of well-drilling in desert areas. (Attached picture)

### 我国农业和水利建设事业  得到苏联人民的伟大援助

    我国农业和水利建设事业
    得到苏联人民的伟大援助
    本报讯　苏联对于我国农业的多方面的友谊援助，正在我国辽阔的土地上开花结果。
    苏联政府1954年帮助我国建设的国营友谊农场，现在已在肥沃的北满大平原上迅速成长起来。1956年这个农场播种了三十八万一千三百九十亩小麦、大豆、玉米和水稻，都获得了良好的收成，全年上缴给国家商品粮食六千七百多万斤。这个农场的苏联专家们，不但完成了友谊农场的土地规划，而且为我国训练了数百名土地规划的技术干部，为我国建立科学的土地规划和荒地勘测工作。这对于我国将来的大量开垦荒地和建设国营农场事业有重大意义。
    我国各地所建立的最初一批农业机器拖拉机站，在设备上、技术上和经营管理上都得到苏联的许多帮助。当我国开始试办农业机器站的时候，苏联供应我国大量的农业机器，苏联专家并热情地帮助许多农业机器站制定规章、筹建机器修配厂等工作，使这些新生的社会主义农业企业，很快地走上健全发展的轨道。
    在1953年到1955年新疆地区蝗虫灾害的严重时期，苏联政府连续三年派出灭蝗工作队，出动大批飞机，到我国新疆的蝗虫地区大规模地扑灭蝗虫，有力地保护了这个地区的广大农田和畜牧区的草原。从去年开始，我国已经能够基本上控制新疆蝗虫为害。近几年来，苏联还派来植物保护专家，帮助我国培养植物检疫干部，开展植物保护工作。
    在农作物栽培技术和牲畜饲养方面，在推广优良作物品种和牲畜品种方面，苏联也给予我国许多帮助。
    我国的农业科学研究十二年远景规划的制定和我国农业科学院的筹建，也都得到苏联科学机关的大力协助。
    又讯　苏联的水利专家们在中国的水利建设事业中，作出了卓越的贡献。
    在解放后的几年中所建成和正在建设的许多巨大水利工程，从勘测设计到施工，都有苏联专家参加和进行技术指导。最近正式开工的三门峡水利枢纽工程的设计和施工单位中，目前有以这个工程的设计总工程师柯洛廖夫同志为首的十三位苏联专家在进行工作。历年来已经完成的和正在施工的淮河流域的一系列的大水库、永定河流域的官厅水库、辽河流域的大伙房水库、汉江流域的杜家台分洪工程、江苏省沿海的射阳港大闸等等工程，也都是在苏联专家的热情帮助下进行建设的。目前，水利部的苏联专家组还在帮助我国进行黄河支流伊河、洛河等河流的大水库的勘测设计。
    在大河流的流域综合规划方面，一开始就得到了苏联专家的大力帮助。在苏联科学家的直接帮助下，我国已于1955年上半年完成了黄河流域综合规划。从1955年起，我国第一大河流长江的流域规划就已开始了。现在一个以季米特利耶夫斯基同志为首的苏联专家组正在我国帮助编制这个内容极其庞杂的流域规划的要点。季米特利耶夫斯基同志是苏联国内最有声望的、经验丰富的水利专家，苏联东部的安加拉河流域规划就是在他领导下进行的。现在这位年逾六十的老专家正在为造福中国人民而贡献自己的智慧。我国浙江省的钱塘江的流域规划在今年第一季度开始，目前有几位苏联专家已前往杭州，帮助开展这项工作。
    在小型农田水利建设方面，也得到苏联专家的可贵的帮助。几年前，苏联水利专家在我国介绍了合理的灌溉方法——沟灌和计划用水，这两个先进的灌溉方法已在一部分灌区开始推行。内蒙古畜牧区长期严重地缺水，直接威胁着畜牧业的发展。水利部的苏联专家们非常关心这个问题，从去年以来，他们就一再进行研究，现已提出了解决在沙漠地区打井的技术问题的建议。（附图片）
