Xinhua News Agency, April 10th. The rainy season is approaching in southern provinces such as Guangdong, and the flood season will follow. The Yangtze River's peach blossom flood will also arrive. The State Council has therefore issued a notice requiring all regions to prepare for flood prevention and strengthen flood prevention work to ensure a bumper harvest this year.

The notice requires: (1) People's Committees at all levels in areas where the flood season is approaching should urge relevant departments to make proper arrangements for flood prevention work. Sufficient preparations should be made for manpower organization and material allocation so that they can be put into combat at any time when floods occur. All localities should be vigilant about flood conditions and overcome complacency.

	(2) Water conservancy projects under spring repair and those currently underway should strive to complete their tasks on schedule or ahead of schedule to prevent being caught off guard by the early arrival of floods. The quality of the projects must be guaranteed to improve flood control capabilities. Specific arrangements for flood prevention should also be made early.

	(3) Fully estimate the possible arrival of extraordinary floods and make plans for preventing extraordinary floods in advance to avoid being caught off guard in a panic.

	(4) Strengthen the management and maintenance of completed projects, overcome the phenomenon of neglecting project management, and solve the problems existing in project management work in terms of cadre allocation, political leadership, and living welfare.
