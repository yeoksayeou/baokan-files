Xinhua News Agency, April 20th: The Kazakh State Kurmangazy Folk Orchestra of the Soviet Union gave its first performance in China tonight at the Beijing People's Theater. The Beijing audience heard multi-part symphonic music played with Kazakh national stringed instruments such as the Dombra and Kobyz for the first time.

　　Through more than 20 years of effort and reform, this orchestra has been able to use the ensemble of the Dombra and Kobyz, with their wide range and beautiful timbre, to replace the original Dombra and Kobyz solos, creating conditions for mastering complex symphonic music.

　　At the beginning of tonight's concert, the musicians from the Kazakh Republic played the Soviet and Chinese national anthems, followed by Kazakh folk music, classical Russian and European musical works, and the works of Chinese musician He Luting, as well as singing Chinese folk songs. The successful performances of the Kazakh musicians aroused enthusiastic applause from the audience time and time again.

　　Minister of Culture Shen Yanbing, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries Chu Tunan, and well-known figures from Beijing's music circles all came to listen to the performance tonight. At the end of the concert, the audience all stood up and applauded warmly. Shen Yanbing, Zhang Hanfu, He Luting, and others went on stage to shake hands with the musicians from the Kazakh Republic. Male and female actors of the Kazakh and other ethnic groups from the Central National Song and Dance Troupe presented flowers to the Kazakh musicians.

　　Minister-Counselor of the Soviet Embassy in China, Abrasimov, and embassy staff also came to listen to the performance tonight.

    哈萨克斯坦民间乐队首次演出
    据新华社20日讯　苏联哈萨克斯坦国立库尔曼喀则民间乐队今天晚上在北京人民剧场举行来中国以后的首次演出。北京听众第一次听到用哈萨克民族弦乐器东不拉琴和科比兹琴等演奏的多声部交响乐。
    这个乐队经过二十多年的努力和改革，已经能够用音域宽阔、音色美丽的东不拉琴和科比兹琴的合奏，代替原始的东不拉和科比兹的独奏，为掌握复杂的交响乐创造了条件。
    哈萨克共和国的音乐家们在今晚的音乐会开始时，奏苏联和中国国歌，接着演奏了哈萨克民间乐曲、俄罗斯和欧洲的古典音乐作品，以及中国音乐家贺绿汀的作品，并演唱了中国民歌。哈萨克音乐家们成功的演奏，一次又一次地激起听众的热烈掌声。
    文化部部长沈雁冰，外交部副部长章汉夫，中国人民对外文化协会会长楚图南以及北京音乐界著名人士今晚都来听演奏。音乐会结束时，听众全体起立热烈鼓掌，沈雁冰、章汉夫、贺绿汀等上台同哈萨克共和国的音乐家们握手，中央民族歌舞团哈萨克等族的男女演员向哈萨克音乐家们献了花。
    苏联驻华大使馆公使衔参赞阿布拉西莫夫及使馆人员今晚也来听演奏。
