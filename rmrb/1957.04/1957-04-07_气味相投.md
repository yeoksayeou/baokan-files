    Birds of a Feather

    Betsy, a chimpanzee at the Baltimore Zoo in the United States, has recently become a "great painter." Her "works" have caused a sensation in the American art world. American newspapers and periodicals call her an artistic "maestro," enthusiastically commenting on "the style and technique of this genius's work." So-called "ultra-modern abstract" painters are especially full of admiration for Betsy's "works." This is truly news! In the past, only humans could become painters, but now in the United States, even animals can become painters, and even "maestros"!

    Originally, in the United States, there were many people who were not treated as humans. For example, Native Americans do not receive human treatment. At one time, American colonists called them "two-legged animals in the forest." But now, real two-legged animals in the forest are regarded as humans. Not only are they regarded as humans, but also as admirable "geniuses."

    It is said that the teaching of Darwin's theory of evolution is prohibited in many schools in the United States because some Americans dislike this scientific theory. However, now Darwin's theory of evolution has been completely reversed—do you say that humans evolved from apes? Do you say that humans are the "soul of all things"? Wrong! In the United States, some people are "evolving" towards chimpanzees! It is said that a group of "ultra-modern abstract" masters in California are preparing to invite Betsy to participate in their exhibition. We do not know the address of this exhibition. In fact, in order to accelerate their pace of "evolving" towards chimpanzees, it would be better for Betsy to invite the "ultra-modern abstract" masters to the forest to participate in "their" exhibition.

    Some say that this is the degradation of American art. In fact, true American art has not degenerated, but the spiritual civilization of the American bourgeoisie is deteriorating shockingly. Although they have plenty of money, their spiritual life is terrifyingly empty. They seek novelty and stimulation, and worship bestiality. This is the character of the American monopoly capital group, and it is the character it wants to cultivate among Americans, because the American monopoly capital group's expansion in the world requires a cold, ruthless, cruel, and sinister bestial character. In terms of having a bestial nature, there are indeed similarities between the American monopoly capital group and the chimpanzee Betsy. Isn't the reason why the American bourgeois newspapers are so eager to praise Betsy simply because they are "birds of a feather"?

    气味相投
    美国巴尔的摩动物园的黑猩猩别特西最近成了“大画家”。它的“作品”轰动了美国的绘画界。美国报刊把它称为艺术的“巨匠”，热烈地评论着“这位天才的作品风格和手法”。所谓“超现代抽象派”的画家们对于别特西的“作品”尤其叹赏不止。这真是新闻！从前，只有人才可以成为画家，如今在美国，连动物也可以成为画家了，而且还是“巨匠”！
    本来，在美国，有许多人一向是不被人当作人的。比如印第安人就得不到人的待遇。有一个时期美洲殖民者把他们叫做“森林中的两足动物”。可是现在，真正的森林中的两足动物倒是被人看作人了。不仅是看作人，而且看作是值得赞叹的“天才”。
    听说，在美国的许多学校里是禁止讲授达尔文的进化论的，因为有一些美国人讨厌这种科学理论。可是，现在达尔文的进化论竟被整个地颠倒过来了——你说人是从猿进化来的吗？你说人是“万物之灵”吗？不对！在美国，有一些人正在向猩猩“进化”！据说，加利福尼亚州的一批“超现代抽象派”的大师们，正准备邀请别特西参加他们的展览会。我们不知道这个展览会的地址在什么地方。其实，为了加速他们向猩猩“进化”的步伐，倒不如由别特西来邀请“超现代抽象派”的大师们，到森林里去参加“它们的”展览会。
    有人说，这是美国艺术的堕落。其实，美国的真正艺术并没有堕落，只是美国资产阶级的精神文明在惊人地堕落。他们尽管有的是钱，可是他们的精神生活却空虚得可怕。他们追求新奇和刺激，崇拜兽性。这就是美国垄断资本集团的性格，也就是它要在美国人中间培养的性格，因为美国垄断资本集团在世界上的扩张，就是需要有冷酷无情、残忍阴险的兽性的性格。在具有兽性这一点上来说，美国垄断资本集团同猩猩别特西之间，确实有相似之处。美国资产阶级报刊所以要把别特西大捧特捧，难道不就是因为“气味相投”的原故吗？
