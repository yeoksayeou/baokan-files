Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, April 25th: The CCP Gansu Provincial Committee held a provincial work conference on culture and education from the 13th to the 22nd, together with intellectuals from all sectors of the province, to discuss how to correctly handle contradictions among the people.

The conference was presided over by Zhang Zhongliang, First Secretary of the CCP Gansu Provincial Committee. Attending the conference were 445 intellectuals from the Gansu provincial and special district level cultural and educational systems, various democratic parties, and democratic personages.

The meeting pointed out that intellectuals in Gansu have made rapid progress in recent years and have a close relationship with the Party, but there are still many problems. For example, in some areas and units, Party members do not respect intellectuals, and intellectuals have positions without power. Intellectuals also meet every day but do not know each other's hearts. The main reason for the above situation is the privileged thinking and sectarianism of some Party members. The meeting requested that Party committees at all levels adopt "heart-to-heart leadership, kind language, a consultative attitude, and flexible methods" towards intellectuals, and called on Party members and intellectuals to transform together and progress together.

The meeting also pointed out the situation in Gansu Province since the implementation of the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy, criticized the fear of chaos and the fear of being rectified, and believed that Marxism-Leninism is a universal truth that can withstand debate and refutation, and there is no need to fear chaos. Everyone does not need to have concerns about being rectified, and can boldly express their opinions.

    实行知心的领导　采用灵活方式
    中共甘肃省委召开文教工作会议
    新华社兰州25日电　中共甘肃省委13日到22日召开全省文教工作会议，和全省各界知识分子一道讨论如何正确处理人民内部的矛盾问题。
    会议由中共甘肃省委第一书记张仲良主持。出席会议的有甘肃省、专两级文教系统、各民主党派、民主人士知识分子四百四十五人。
    会议指出：甘肃知识分子几年来进步很快，和党的关系密切，但也存在着不少问题。如有些地区和单位，党员对知识分子不尊重，知识分子有职无权。知识分子也是天天见面，不知心。产生以上情况主要原因是有些党员的特权思想和宗派主义作风。会议要求各级党委对知识分子应采取“知心的领导，亲切的语言，协商的态度，灵活的方式”，并号召党员和知识分子共同改造，共同进步。
    会议还指出甘肃省执行“百花齐放、百家争鸣”方针以来的情况，批判了怕乱和怕挨整的思想，认为马列主义是普遍真理，经得起辩论反驳，不怕乱。大家更不必有怕整的顾虑，可以大胆的鸣。
