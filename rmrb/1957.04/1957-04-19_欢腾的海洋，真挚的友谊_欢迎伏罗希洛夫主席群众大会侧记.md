    Jubilant Ocean, Sincere Friendship
    —A Sideline Account of the Mass Rally Welcoming Chairman Voroshilov
    By Our Staff Reporter
        Old Voroshilov's Enthusiasm Touches Hearts
    Five minutes before the welcoming rally began, Chairman Voroshilov, accompanied by Chairman Mao and others, arrived at the venue. A wave of joyous enthusiasm immediately swept through the entire stadium.
    After Comrade Peng Zhen delivered the welcoming speech, Old Voroshilov began to speak. His loud and clear voice echoed throughout the entire venue, and his passionate words stirred people's hearts. When he quoted Chinese proverbs to describe the solidarity between China and the Soviet Union, and Bai Juyi's poems to express the hope for happiness for all the people of the world, the reaction in the venue was particularly enthusiastic. People immediately whispered to each other, smiling, expressing their admiration and emotion at Old Voroshilov's familiarity with the situation in China.
    While Old Voroshilov's speech was being translated into Chinese, Old Voroshilov stood upright and motionless. Mayor Peng Zhen repeatedly asked him to sit down and rest, but he politely declined. After Old Voroshilov finished his speech, Chairman Mao Zedong stood up to express his gratitude to him. The two chairmen embraced each other tightly once again. At that moment, the joy in the entire stadium reached a climax. Many people were moved to tears. Old Voroshilov's enthusiasm, and the brotherly friendship between the leaders of China and the Soviet Union, formed an immense force that warmed the hearts of everyone in the venue.
    Flower Petals Transmit Friendship Across Thousands of Miles
    Many of the masses who participated in the welcoming rally had already arrived at the venue around 10:00 AM yesterday to wait for the distinguished guests. Everywhere in the venue, one could see people in groups of three or five reading the news about Chairman Voroshilov in the day's newspaper. A group of students from Beijing Women's No. 5 Middle School had, for the most part, gone to Nanyuan Airport on April 15th to welcome Old Voroshilov. Everyone was extremely excited to have seen Chairman Voroshilov and Chairman Mao.
  Many students also specially picked up the flower
  petals that had been sprinkled on Chairman Voroshilov
  and brought them back. Some people kept these flower petals in their books as souvenirs, while others attached them to letters as precious gifts and sent them to good friends in Chengdu, far away in southwestern China. Each of them also told their families about what they had seen that day and their thoughts. After Li Huanzhen, a student from the Senior One class, returned home that day, she immediately told her mother, who was preparing dinner, everything in detail. Her mother was so engrossed in listening that she put the empty steamer on the stove to steam when she was steaming steamed buns. It was only after a while that she realized that the raw steamed buns on the table had not been put into the steamer.
    Shaanxi Farmers Encounter Double Happiness
    On the southern stands and in the middle of the field of the stadium, some masses with white towels wrapped around their heads and dark faces attracted a lot of attention. People could tell at a glance that they were working farmers. But they were neither from the eastern suburbs nor from the western suburbs, but a delegation from northern Shaanxi who had come to Beijing on April 16th to visit the National Agricultural Exhibition. When they learned that a mass rally to welcome Chairman Voroshilov was to be held yesterday afternoon, everyone scrambled to ask their delegation leader to request the relevant departments to allow them to attend this grand event. After several twists and turns, their wish was finally realized. Feng Shuan, a farmer in his sixties and the vice chairman of the Lianmeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Ganquan County, said: "This time, our farmers from remote mountain villages came to the capital Beijing to visit the agricultural exhibition, and we also had the opportunity to see the chairmen of China and the Soviet Union. It's really something we never expected." Another labor model who came with him, named Bai Qingfu, said that this was double happiness.
    Workers See Chairman in Their Dreams
    The night before yesterday, more than 30 employees of the Beijing Weaving, Knitting and Dyeing Factory were so excited that they could hardly fall asleep, and they imagined the grand occasion of the conference the next day in advance. Li Shuying, a female worker who inspects the quality of the weft at the venue yesterday, told everyone that she was thinking about it the night before, and she fell asleep in a daze. But suddenly, she found herself in the Beijing Hotel and participated in the reception welcoming Old Voroshilov that was being held here. She also clearly saw Chairman Mao and Chairman Voroshilov sitting together, talking and laughing. At this time, she couldn't help but shout with joy and woke up with a start, only to find that she was in a dream. After telling this "sleepwalking story," she smiled at everyone in the venue and said: "Now I really see Chairman Mao and Chairman Voroshilov sitting together!"
    Reluctant to Part, Intentions Unfulfilled
    The speeches were over, and the banners were presented. Accompanied by Chairman Mao and other leading comrades, the distinguished guests walked out of the venue. By this time, the mass rally was nearing its end, but people were reluctant to leave, wishing they could stay with the distinguished guests for a little longer! The feelings of the female students of Beijing No. 1 Normal School could no longer be suppressed. They turned to the Soviet experts and Soviet friends in the stands, cheering, applauding, and waving their headscarves and handkerchiefs, chanting "Moscow-Beijing" and shouting "Thank you, Soviet experts!" The Soviet friends also shouted "Long live Mao Zedong!" and "Long live China!" in response. They waved their hats, waved their hands, and sang "Moscow-Beijing" with everyone. People were once again immersed in the joy of friendship. A Soviet friend from the high stands shouted with difficulty in Chinese, "Long live the unbreakable friendship between China and the Soviet Union!" He rushed down and enthusiastically shook hands with the students standing in the field at the railing of the stands. In an instant, countless hands clasped on the railing. The excitement of friendship spread like electricity. An elderly Soviet female expert affectionately embraced a Chinese girl and said emotionally, "Dear..." Some experts said in broken Chinese, "Long live," "Thank you," and "Wish you all good health!" (Attached pictures)

    欢腾的海洋，真挚的友谊
　　——欢迎伏罗希洛夫主席群众大会侧记
    本报记者
        伏老热情感人心
    欢迎大会开始前五分钟，伏罗希洛夫主席由毛主席等陪同来到会场。欢腾的热浪顿时席卷了全场。
    在彭真同志致欢迎词后，伏老开始讲话了。他的宏亮的声音回荡着全场，他的热情的话语激动着人心。当他引用中国的俗话来形容中苏两国的团结，引用白居易的诗句来表示世界人民共幸福的希望的时候，场内的反应特别热烈。人们立即传着耳语，露着笑容，对伏老如此熟悉中国的情况表示钦佩和感动。
    在伏老的讲话被译成中文时，伏老一直站着屹立不动，彭真市长几次请他就座休息都被婉谢。伏老讲完话后，毛泽东主席站立起来向他表示感谢。两位主席再一次紧紧地拥抱起来。在这一刹那，全场的欢腾达到了高潮中的高潮。许多人感动得热泪夺眶而出。伏老的热情，中苏两国领袖亲如兄弟的情谊，形成了一股无比巨大的力量，温暖着全场每一个人的心。
    花瓣千里传友情
    参加欢迎大会的许多群众在昨天上午十点多就已赶到会场等候贵宾。在会场里，处处可以看到人们三五成群地在阅读着当天报上有关伏罗希洛夫主席的消息。北京市女五中的一群学生，绝大部分人都曾在4月15日到南苑机场去欢迎过伏老。大家都因为见到了伏罗希洛夫主席和毛主席而兴奋得不得了。许
  多同学还特地把洒给伏罗希洛夫主
  席的鲜花瓣重新捡起来带回去。有的人把这些花瓣夹在自己的书里留念，有的人把它当作珍贵的礼物附在信里寄给远在西南成都的好朋友。她们每一个人还把当天看到的情形和自己的感想告诉家里人。高一班的李焕珍同学那天回家以后就连忙一五一十地讲给正在准备晚饭的母亲听。她母亲因为听得出神，结果在蒸馒头的时候把空的蒸笼放到炉子上去蒸了。过了半天才发现桌上的生馒头没有放进蒸笼里去。
    陕北农民逢双喜
    在体育场的南部看台上和场中间，有一些头缠白巾、脸呈黝黑的群众很受人注意。人们一看就知道他们是劳动农民。但他们既不来自东郊也不来自西郊，而是4月16日从陕北来京参观全国农业展览会的代表团。当他们知道昨天下午要举行欢迎伏罗希洛夫主席的群众大会的消息时，大家就争着请他们的团长向有关部门要求来参加这个盛会。几经周折之后，他们的愿望终于实现了。六十岁开外的老农民、甘泉县联盟农业生产合作社的副社长冯拴说：咱们偏僻山沟里的农民这次到首都北京来参观农业展览会，又碰上了机会看到中苏两国的主席，真是一生意想不到的事情。同来的另一位名叫白清福的劳动模范说，这是喜上加喜。
    工人梦中见主席
    前天晚上，北京机织印染厂的三十多名职工兴奋得难以入睡，并且事先就想像起下一天的大会盛况起来了。络纬质量检查女工李树英在昨天会场上告诉大家说，她在前天晚上想着想着，迷迷糊糊地睡着了。但是，忽然之间，她发觉自己来到了北京饭店，并且参加了正在这里举行的欢迎伏老的酒会，还清清楚楚地看见了毛主席和伏罗希洛夫主席坐在一起又说又笑。这时她不禁高兴得大叫一声，惊醒过来，发觉原来是自己在梦境里。讲完这段“梦游记”以后，她在会场上笑着向大家说：“这下可真的看见毛主席和伏罗希洛夫主席坐在一起了！”
    依依惜别意未尽
    讲话完了，锦旗献过了。贵宾在毛主席和其他领导同志的陪同下走出了会场，这时已经接近了群众大会的尾声，但是，人们舍不得离去，多么想同贵宾们在一起再多呆一会儿啊！北京第一师范的女学生们的心情，再也按捺不住了。她们转向看台上的苏联专家和苏联朋友们欢呼，鼓掌，挥舞着头巾和手帕，高唱“莫斯科—北京”，高呼“谢谢苏联专家！”苏联朋友们也喊着“毛泽东万岁！”“中国万岁！”来作答，他们挥着帽子，招着手，随着大家唱“莫斯科—北京”。人们又浸沉在友情的欢乐中。一位苏联朋友从看台高处吃力地用中文喊着“中苏两国牢不可破的友谊万岁！”一边飞奔下来，到看台的栏杆处和站在场内的学生们热情握手，一霎时，无数只手在栏杆上相握了。友情的激动像电流一样传开了。一位年老的苏联女专家亲热地吻抱着一个中国姑娘连声感动地说：“亲爱的……”，有些专家则操着不流利的中国话说，“万岁”，“谢谢”，“祝大家健康！”（附图片）
