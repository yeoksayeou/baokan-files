Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 23rd -- Chairman Voroshilov delivered a passionate speech to the 250,000 Shanghai citizens gathered in Shanghai's People's Square to welcome him today (see page two). After Chairman Voroshilov's speech, Chairman Liu Shaoqi led the masses in raising their arms and shouting, "Long Live Comrade Voroshilov," "Long Live the Soviet Union," "Long Live Marxism," "Long Live Leninism," "Long Live the Great Unity of the Soviet and Chinese People," "Long Live World Peace." At that moment, People's Square was a sea of red flags and flowers, and the cheers lasted for a long time.

Chairman Voroshilov said at the meeting that the Soviet people all know that thirty-six years ago in Shanghai, Chinese communists held the historically significant First National Congress and established the Communist Party of China. Now, the Communist Party of China, armed with Marxism-Leninism, has grown into a tremendous force, and under its leadership, the Chinese people, who have struggled for freedom for a hundred years, have achieved a victory of world-historical significance.

Chairman Voroshilov said: All progressive people regard the fraternal alliance between China and the Soviet Union as a strong fortress of world peace. The people of our two countries will not disappoint the hopes of all peace-loving people in the world.

Chairman Voroshilov was accompanied today by Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Vice Premier He Long, Secretary of the CPC Central Committee's Shanghai Bureau and First Secretary of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee Ke Qingshi, Vice Mayor of Shanghai Cao Diqiu, and others to attend the Shanghai citizens' welcoming rally.

Vice Mayor Cao Diqiu first delivered a welcoming speech at the meeting, saying that the people of Shanghai feel extremely honored and happy to be able to meet our respected and beloved Chairman Voroshilov in their own city. As early as thirty years ago, when the working class of Shanghai raised the banner of revolution and achieved victory in the armed uprising, the Soviet Trade Union Council sent a telegram on behalf of all Soviet workers saying, "We are always with you." The people of China and the Soviet Union are so closely linked, shoulder to shoulder, in times of hardship and in times of victory, forever together.

Cao Diqiu presented gifts to Chairman Voroshilov on behalf of the more than six million citizens of Shanghai. One of the gifts was a velvet embroidered portrait of Chairman Voroshilov carefully woven by Shanghai's embroidery women. After accepting the gift, Chairman Voroshilov warmly embraced Vice Mayor Cao Diqiu amidst thunderous cheers.

    人民广场上一片红旗和鲜花　欢呼声震天动地
    上海二十五万市民集会欢迎伏老
    刘少奇委员长领导群众高呼苏联中国人民伟大团结万岁
    据新华社上海23日电　伏罗希洛夫主席今天向聚集在上海人民广场上欢迎他的二十五万上海市民，发表热情洋溢的演说（见第二版）。在伏罗希洛夫主席演说之后，刘少奇委员长领导群众举臂高呼：“伏罗希洛夫同志万岁”，“苏联万岁”，“马克思主义万岁”，“列宁主义万岁”，“苏联中国两国人民的伟大团结万岁”，“世界和平万岁”。这时，人民广场上是一片红旗和鲜花的海洋，欢呼声久久不息。
    伏罗希洛夫主席在大会上说，苏联人民都知道，三十六年前在上海，中国的共产主义者举行了有历史意义的第一次代表大会，成立了中国共产党。现在，以马克思列宁主义武装起来的中国共产党，已经成长为巨大的力量，一百年来为了争取自由而进行斗争的中国人民在它的领导下取得了具有世界历史意义的胜利。
    伏罗希洛夫主席说：所有进步的人们都把中苏的兄弟联盟看做世界和平的强大堡垒。我们两国人民是不会辜负世界所有爱好和平的人们的希望的。
    伏罗希洛夫主席今天由刘少奇委员长，贺龙副总理，中共中央上海局书记、中共上海市委员会第一书记柯庆施，上海市副市长曹荻秋等陪同出席上海市民的欢迎大会。
    曹荻秋副市长在会上首先致欢迎词说，上海人民能够在自己的城市里会见我们尊敬和爱戴的伏罗希洛夫主席，感到莫大的光荣和幸福。远在三十年前，当上海的工人阶级举起革命的旗帜，取得武装起义胜利的时候，苏联总工会代表全苏工人拍来电报说：“我们始终和你们在一起”。中苏两国人民就是这样心连着心，肩并着肩，在患难中，在胜利中，永远同在一起。
    曹荻秋代表上海六百多万市民向伏罗希洛夫主席献礼。礼品之一是上海刺绣女工精心织作的一幅伏罗希洛夫主席的绒绣像。伏罗希洛夫主席接受礼品后，在震天的欢呼声中跟曹荻秋副市长亲密拥抱。
