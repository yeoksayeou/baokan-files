Reports of drastic change in Jordanian Situation:

    Al-Khalidi Cabinet Resigns, Pro-Western Government Takes Office
    Nationwide Martial Law Declared, All Political Parties Dissolved

    (Dispatch from this newspaper) According to Western news agency reports, the Jordanian Al-Khalidi cabinet resigned on the 24th, and has been accepted by King Hussein. Hussein appointed Hashim as Prime Minister, forming a new "pro-Western" cabinet. Former Prime Minister Rifai was appointed Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister. Martial law has been declared nationwide in Jordan, and all political parties have been dissolved; national police and security forces have been taken over by the army. Curfews have been imposed in Amman, Jerusalem, and other cities. According to the Associated Press, Jordanian government authorities have cut off all contact with the outside world since 1:00 AM on the 25th.

    The changes in the Jordanian situation took place after large-scale demonstrations and a nationwide general strike broke out across the country. On the 24th, mass demonstrations and a general strike erupted nationwide in Jordan to oppose foreign imperialist interference in Jordan's internal affairs and to protest the US attempt to impose the "Eisenhower Doctrine" on Jordan. On the 24th, thousands upon thousands of Jordanians angrily poured into the streets of Amman, chanting slogans such as "Down with the Eisenhower Doctrine," "There is no vacuum in Jordan, only in Eisenhower's head," demanding the release of arrested officers, and demanding the resignation of the Al-Khalidi cabinet.

    According to the Middle East News Agency, Jordanian police and government officials also participated in the demonstrations and strikes. Initially, demonstrators clashed with police, but after a few minutes, some police officers stood with the people, chanting slogans against the "Eisenhower Doctrine" in unison with the masses. Government offices were also shut down due to the strike by officials. Most shops in Amman were closed.

    On the same day, large-scale mass demonstrations also took place in Jordanian cities such as Jerusalem, Nablus, Ramallah, and Jericho.

    It is reported that the Jordanian government has ordered armed police and military police to "move into position" to "deal with" the demonstrators. A Middle East News Agency reporter said: Observers on the scene believe that "the situation has become so serious that it may explode at any time."

    A United Press dispatch on the 24th stated that the Jordanian army had blockaded the Syrian-Jordanian border, and that Iraqi forces had approached the Syrian-Jordanian border, "intending to take over full control of the border in the name of (Jordanian) King Hussein." It is said that both Iraqi and Jordanian authorities denied this news, but another report revealed that some Iraqi armored forces had entered Jordan as "volunteers." Still other reports say that the King of Jordan has demanded that Syria immediately withdraw all of its troops stationed in Jordan.

    According to United Press quoting Israeli sources on the 24th, Iraq has delivered an ultimatum to the governments of Egypt and Syria, threatening to intervene in Jordan. It said that if King Hussein's regime is overthrown, Iraq will use force.

    These sources said that Iraq's "warning" was issued by the Iraqi embassies in Egypt and Syria on the evening of the 23rd.

    Israeli sources said that due to increasing pressure against King Hussein and the Al-Khalidi government, Iraq has decided to exert its influence on the political crisis in Jordan.

    United Press also quoted Israeli sources on the 24th as saying that Israeli Prime Minister Ben-Gurion's current policy towards Jordan is to try to avoid taking any action that would further complicate the work of King Hussein or Prime Minister Al-Khalidi. These sources said that the aim of the Israeli government's policy is to enable "pro-Western elements in Jordan to salvage their leadership."

    Another dispatch: US President's special envoy Richards, who is peddling the "Eisenhower Doctrine" in the Middle East, is now staying in Ethiopia waiting for the development of the situation in Jordan. US officials admitted on the 24th that they had originally hoped that the situation in Jordan would be "clarified" by the end of the week, so that they could decide "whether it was appropriate" for Richards to go to Jordan, but now they are "disappointed."

    US officials said that Richards' next action will have to be determined according to the daily development of the situation in Jordan. What Washington is currently worried about is that Richards' "visit" to Jordan would be "inopportune" because it may lead to an "anti-American" movement among the Jordanian people.

    约旦局势发生剧变
    哈利迪内阁辞职　亲西方政府上台
    全国宣布戒严令　所有政党被解散
    本报讯　据西方通讯社消息，约旦哈利迪内阁已经于24日辞职，并且已经为侯赛因国王所接受。侯赛因任命哈希姆为首相，组成“亲西方”的新内阁，前首相里法伊被任命为外交大臣兼副首相。约旦全国宣布戒严，所有的政党都被解散；全国警察和保安部队都由陆军接管。安曼、耶路撒冷和其他一些城市实行了宵禁。据美联社报道，约旦政府当局已从25日上午一时以来就切断同国外的一切联系。
    约旦局势的这一变化，是在约旦全国各地爆发了一次大规模的示威和全国总罢工以后发生的。24日约旦全国爆发了群众示威运动和总罢工，以反对外国帝国主义对约旦内政的干涉，抗议美国企图把“艾森豪威尔主义”强加于约旦的阴谋计划。24日，成千成万的约旦人激愤地涌在安曼的各条街道上，示威群众高呼“打倒艾森豪威尔主义”，“约旦没有真空，只是在艾森豪威尔的头脑中有真空”，要求释放被捕的军官，要求哈利迪内阁辞职等口号。
    据中东通讯社报道，约旦警察和政府官员们也参加了示威游行和罢工。起初示威群众曾和警察发生冲突，但几分钟以后，一部分警察就同人民站在一起，和群众同声高呼反对“艾森豪威尔主义”的口号。政府机关由于官员们的罢工也停止了办公。安曼的大多数商店都关了门。
    同日，耶路撒冷、纳布鲁斯、拉马拉和杰里科等约旦的城市，也发生了大规模群众示威游行。
    据悉，约旦政府已经命令武装军警“开进阵地”，以“对付”示威群众。中东通讯社的记者报道说：现场的观察家们认为，“局势已经严重到可能在任何时候发生爆炸的地步”。
    合众社24日电讯说，约旦陆军封锁了叙利亚和约旦边境，并且伊拉克部队已逼近叙利亚和约旦边境，“打算以（约旦）国王侯赛因名义接管对边境的全面控制。”据说，伊拉克和约旦当局都否认了这个消息，但另一消息透露，某些伊拉克装甲部队已经以“志愿军”身份进入约旦。而有消息说，约旦国王已要求叙利亚立即撤出它驻扎在约旦的所有军队。
    据合众社引以色列人士24日的话说，伊拉克已经把一份最后通牒交给埃及和叙利亚政府，最后通牒威胁着要对约旦进行干涉。它说，如果侯赛因国王的政权被推翻，伊拉克将使用武力。
    这些人士说，伊拉克的这个“警告”是23日晚间由伊拉克驻埃及和叙利亚大使馆发出的。
    以色列人士说，由于反对侯赛因国王和哈利迪政府的压力不断增强，伊拉克已经决定对约旦的政局危机施用它的影响。
    合众社还引以色列人士24日的话报道，以色列总理本—古里安目前对约旦的政策是竭力避免采取会使侯赛因国王或哈利迪首相的工作更加复杂的任何行动。这些人士说，以色列政府政策的目的是使“约旦亲西方分子能够挽救他们的领导权”。
    又讯　正在中东推销“艾森豪威尔主义”的美国总统特使理查兹，现在呆在埃塞俄比亚等待约旦局势的发展。美国官员们24日承认，他们原来希望上周末约旦情况会得到“澄清”，从而使他们能够决定理查兹到约旦去“是否适宜”，而现在，他们已经“失望”了。
    美国官员们说，理查兹的下一个行动，将不得不根据约旦每天局势的发展而定，目前华盛顿所担心的是，理查兹“访问”约旦将是“不合时宜”的，因为可能导致约旦人民的“反美”运动。
