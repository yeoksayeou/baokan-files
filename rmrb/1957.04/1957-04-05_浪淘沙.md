    Lang Tao Sha (Waves Wash Sand)
    Fei Qing
    An early spring scene at the Taihu Sanatorium, with a lament for the martyrs of San Shan Island across the lake.
　　Spring arrives at Da Wang Tou,
    Fairyland on Penglai Island,
    Bright reds and tender greens encircle the jade towers.
    A wisp of smoke on the vast misty horizon,
    Light clouds and floating haze.
    Crimson blood has seen many autumns,
    Wind and rain bury sorrow,
    Now the flowers and birds are all in their prime.
    The beautiful lake and mountains are under your command,
    Allow me to rest and wander.

    浪淘沙
    费青
    太湖疗养院早春即景，并吊隔湖三山岛诸烈士
　　春到大?头，
    蓬岛仙洲，
    嫣红嫩绿绕琼楼。
    一抹烟波浩渺际，
    云淡岚浮。
    碧血几经秋，
    风雨埋愁，
    即今花鸟尽风流。
    锦绣湖山君管领，
    容我休游。
