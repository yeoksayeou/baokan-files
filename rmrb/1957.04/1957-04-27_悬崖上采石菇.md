Local Scene

    In the Xingtai mountainous region of Xianyou, Fujian, stands the steep and craggy Maixie Mountain. This mountain produces a precious medicinal product: stone mushrooms.

    There is a legend here that long, long ago, a man who made his living by gathering herbs and his son came to a cliff to collect stone mushrooms. One day, he tied a rope around his son and lowered him down the cliff. Unexpectedly, as the rope reached halfway, his son's body bumped into an eagle's nest on the rock face. Several eagles pecked at his son, and the son fought back with a machete. In a moment of carelessness, he accidentally cut the rope with the knife, and the father watched helplessly as his son fell into the deep valley and was crushed to death. Since then, no one in the nearby villages dared to harvest stone mushrooms again.

    Last year, the Mapu Village at the foot of Maixie Mountain established an advanced cooperative. The young members spun thick hemp ropes that wouldn't be cut by the rocks. Many people held one end of the rope, and a sturdy bamboo basket was tied to the other end. The mushroom harvesters sat in the basket and were lowered down to collect stone mushrooms on the rock face.

    Stone mushrooms resemble shiitake mushrooms and silver fungus, with a blackish-purple color. They grow on cliffs, each mushroom about the size of a plate. They are a good medicine that can replenish blood, moisten the lungs, treat anemia, hemoptysis, heart disease, and various women's ailments. Stone mushrooms are very expensive, about 160 yuan per kilogram. This cooperative has increased its income by several thousand yuan by harvesting stone mushrooms.

### 悬崖上采石菇

    悬崖上采石菇
    福建仙游兴太山区里有一座山高岭峻、奇岩怪石的麦斜山。这座山上生产着一种珍贵的药品——石菇。
    这里有一个传说，在很久很久以前，有一个专以采药为生的外乡人，和他的儿子一齐到悬崖上采石菇。一天，他把儿子用绳吊着，放下悬崖，不料绳子放到半空时，他儿子身体碰到石壁上的老鹰巢，几只老鹰在他儿子四周追啄，他儿子用柴刀与老鹰搏斗，一不小心刀把绳劈断了，这个外乡人眼看着自己的儿子跌在深谷，粉身碎骨而死。自此以后，附近乡邻没有一个人再敢去采石菇了。
    去年，麦斜山山脚下的马埔村成立了高级合作社。年青的社员们就搓了粗大的不会被石头割断的麻绳，绳的一端由许多人拉着；另一端拴了结实的竹篮，采石菇的人坐在篮里，放下去，在石壁上采石菇。
    石菇状似香菇和银耳，颜色黑中带紫，生长在悬崖上，每朵有碟子大，是一种能补血、润肺和能治贫血、吐血、心脏病和治疗妇女各种病的良药。石菇价很贵，每斤约一百六十元，这个社因采石菇，已增加了几千元的收入。
