    Running Nurseries Diligently and Frugally

    One hundred and thirty-five feet of cloth for a baby entering nursery care is indeed excessive.

    I believe that the listed items of clothing are necessary, but the problem lies in the fact that the standards for clothing required by nurseries are too high, and the quantities are also excessive. This situation is mainly due to some leading comrades in nurseries harboring formalistic ideas. They do not consider the economic capabilities of parents and the national level of cloth consumption. They blindly pursue standards, greedily seeking more and better, which does not conform to the spirit of diligence and frugality.

    How can we achieve savings in cloth usage? From what I understand, some nursery staff members have diligently studied and devised some thrifty methods that are worth promoting. For example, many nurseries can start from practical considerations and not demand specific materials for the required clothing, accepting whatever is offered. In fact, using old clothing materials to remake baby clothes and using old bedsheets as diapers are less irritating to babies' skin.

    In terms of washing, drying, and storage, attention should be paid to avoiding losses. When using coal fires for drying on cloudy days, avoid burning or scorching the items. For example, the nursery of the state-owned Shanghai No. 3 Wool Textile Factory has done a good job in inventorying and storing clothing, and has not lost a single item or a piece of diaper in two years. In order to prevent the spread of children's diseases, it is necessary to disinfect children's clothing. However, the disinfection methods used by some nurseries are also worth considering. For example, after each use, diapers are washed and then soaked in Lysol or carbolic acid solution for a few minutes. These strong disinfectants can easily corrode cotton fabrics, which is not very economical. In fact, for healthy babies' clothing and diapers, washing with soapy water and exposing them to sunlight can achieve the purpose of disinfection, and it is not necessary to boil everything.

    Children's clothes, shoes, and socks wear out relatively quickly, so it is also important to pay attention to timely repairs. This not only alleviates the economic burden on parents, but also saves the country a significant amount of cotton cloth consumption.

### 勤俭办乳儿室

    勤俭办乳儿室
    一个乳儿入托须要用布一百三十五尺，这确实是过多一些。
    我认为表内所列的衣物项目是必需的，问题在于哺乳室要的衣物标准太高，数量亦嫌过多。这种情况，主要还是由于某些哺乳室的领导同志存有正规化思想，他们不从家长经济能力和全国人民的用布水平出发，盲目追求规格，贪多图好，这是不符合勤俭办事的精神。
    怎样做到节约用布呢？据我了解，有些哺乳室的工作人员刻苦钻研，想了一些精打细算的办法，是值得提倡的。例如很多哺乳室能从实际出发，规定的衣物不强求质料，做到有啥送啥。事实上用旧衣料改制婴儿衣裤，旧床单撕做尿片，反而不刺激乳儿的皮肤。
    从洗晒保管方面来说，注意不要丢失，阴天使用煤火烘烤时，不要烤焦、烤烂。如国营上海第三毛纺织厂托儿所，因为做好了衣物清点保管工作，两年来没有丢失过一件物品，一块尿片，为了防止儿童疾病传染，对儿童衣物实行消毒是必要的，但是有些哺乳室采用的消毒方法也值得考虑，如尿片每次用后经过洗涤再在来苏儿水或石炭酸水中泡上几分钟等等，这种烈性的消毒水，容易腐蚀棉织品，是不很经济的作法。其实健康乳儿所穿用的衣裤、尿片，经过肥皂水洗涤，在日光下曝晒后，就可以起到消毒的作用，不一定要全部煮沸。
    孩子的衣服鞋袜穿的是比较费的，因此还要注意及时缝补，这样做不但能减轻父母的经济负担，而且可以替国家节省很大一笔棉布消耗量。　　　　　　　　　刘开瑜
