    All-China Federation of Trade Unions
    Voices Support for the Algerian People's Struggle
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th - TASS reported from Moscow on the 11th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, during the "International Week of Support for Algerian Workers and People," which began on April 7th, sent telegrams to the General Union of Algerian Workers, which participates in the World Federation of Trade Unions, and the Algerian Workers' Union, which participates in the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, expressing support for the heroic struggle of the Algerian working people for national independence.
    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 12th - TASS reported from Paris on the 11th: The French government is intensifying its persecution of newspapers and periodicals that report the true situation in Algeria or expose the ugly face of the French authorities' so-called "appeasement" policy. "l'Humanité" wrote on April 11th that the French authorities are attempting to "suffocate freedom of speech in the press" through measures such as fines, confiscation of entire issues of newspapers and periodicals, and legal action. According to the newspaper, the French Communist Party's publication "La Nouvelle France" weekly has been persecuted for publishing an article entitled "Algeria and France" in January.
    The weekly "France Observateur," which was released this week, was also ordered to be confiscated by the government on April 11th because it published an article by K. Bourdet about the repression being carried out in Algeria. The editorial department of the weekly issued a statement protesting this measure by the government.

    全苏工会中央理事会
    声援阿尔及利亚人民的斗争
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科11日讯：全苏工会中央理事会在4月7日开始的“支援阿尔及利亚工人和人民国际行动周”中，打电报给参加世界工会联合会的阿尔及利亚总工会和参加国际自由工会联合会的阿尔及利亚工人联合会，声援为争取祖国民族独立而进行英勇斗争的阿尔及利亚劳动人民。
    新华社12日讯　塔斯社巴黎11日讯：法国政府正加紧迫害报道阿尔及利亚真实情况或是揭露法国当局的所谓“绥靖”政策的丑恶面貌的报刊。“人道报”4月11日写道，法国当局企图用罚款、没收整期报纸和期刊，追究法律责任等这样一些措施来“窒息报刊的言论”。据报纸报道，法国共产党的刊物“新法兰西”周刊由于在1月间刊载了“阿尔及利亚和法国”一篇文章，而遭受了迫害。
    本周发行的“法兰西观察家”周刊也因为刊载了克·布尔德的一篇关于在阿尔及利亚实施的镇压的情况的文章而在4月11日被政府下令没收。这一周刊的编辑部发表声明，对政府这种措施表示抗议。
