Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch: According to TASS reports: In order to fully utilize the Soviet Union's existing two hundred million hectares of cultivated land, experts from various Soviet republics are formulating scientific and rational agricultural management systems for regions with different natural conditions.

Participating in this work are many scientific research institutions and tens of thousands of agricultural experts from collective farms, state farms, and machine tractor stations. The All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences also established a special committee of more than sixty scientists last year to assist various regions in carrying out this work.

The Ukrainian Republic had already formulated a draft regional agricultural management system at the beginning of last year. Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, and other republics promulgated newly formulated draft agricultural management systems in February and March of this year, and held agricultural expert meetings to discuss the drafts. In the Estonian Republic and more than ten regions of the Russian Federation, draft agricultural management systems have also recently been completed.

When formulating agricultural management systems, all republics have paid attention to combining the specific local natural and economic conditions with the use of all agricultural scientific achievements and advanced experiences from both the Soviet Union and abroad. Last year, the experience of Ukraine proved that cultivating according to the newly formulated agricultural management system can greatly increase the unit area yield of crops per hectare.

The current work of formulating regional agricultural management systems is the beginning of a huge effort by the Soviet Union to fully utilize the potential of the land and increase agricultural yields per unit area. In the future, on the basis of the regional agricultural management system, more rational overall measures for managing each collective farm and state farm will be further formulated.

### 使二亿公顷耕地地尽其利  苏联制定地区农业经营制度

    使二亿公顷耕地地尽其利
    苏联制定地区农业经营制度
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社报道：为了充分利用苏联现有的二亿公顷耕地，苏联各加盟共和国的专家正在为各种不同自然条件的地区制定科学合理的农业经营制度。
    参加这一工作的有许多科学研究机关和几万名集体农庄、国营农场和机器拖拉机站的农业专家。全苏列宁农业科学院去年还成立了一个由六十多位科学家组成的专门委员会，帮助各地进行这个工作。
    乌克兰共和国在去年年初就已经制定成了地区性的农业经营制度草案。拉脱维亚、立陶宛、摩尔达维亚等共和国在今年2、3月颁布了新制定成的农业经营草案，并且举行了农业专家会议，对草案进行了讨论。在爱沙尼亚共和国和俄罗斯联邦的十多个地区，农业经营草案也在最近制定完毕。
    各加盟共和国在制定农业经营制度的时候，都注意结合各地的具体自然经济条件和利用苏联国内外的一切农业科学成就和先进经验。去年乌克兰的经验证明，按照新制定的农业经营制度进行耕作，可以大大提高每公顷农作物的单位面积产量。
    目前进行的制定地区性的农业经营制度的工作，是苏联为充分利用土地的潜力，提高农业单位面积产量而进行的巨大工作的一个开端。将来，还要在区域农业经营制度的基础上进一步制定出更合理的经营每个集体农庄和国营农场的全盘措施。
