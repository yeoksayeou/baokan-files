	Hen's Pregnancy
	Shi Lichuan, a relative of an overseas Chinese in Dongshan Village, Shenlu Town, Jinjiang County, Fujian Province, slaughtered a hen on March 3rd. As soon as she opened its abdomen, she found a large egg, about three times the size of a normal chicken egg, with many bead-like small eggs beside it. When the large egg was broken open, more than half a bowl of water flowed out, and inside, a not-fully-developed chick was found, with two small feet, very hard claws, no head or wings, and many coarse yellow feathers all over its body. It is said that this phenomenon is called in vivo development in hens.

    母鸡怀胎
    福建晋江县深泸镇东山村侨属施丽传，3月3日杀了一只母鸡。刚剖开肚，发现一个大蛋，有平常鸡蛋三个那样大，旁边还有许多珠子一样的小蛋。把大蛋破开，流出半碗多水，里边发现一只发育还不完全的小鸡，两支小脚，有很硬的脚爪，没有头翼，全身有许多黄色的粗羽毛。据说，这种现象叫母鸡体腔内发育。
