Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 23rd: The Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party recently released the communiqué of its 12th (Enlarged) Session.

The Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party held its 12th (Enlarged) Session in March of this year. The meeting primarily discussed two issues: the 1957 National Plan, and army building and national defense consolidation. In addition, the meeting passed a resolution commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution.

Regarding the 1957 National Plan, the communiqué stated that the Party Central Committee's 12th Session, based on the tasks and guidelines for the 1957 financial and economic work proposed by the 11th Central Committee Session, studied the 1957 National Plan and the measures necessary to implement in order to basically complete the economic recovery work.

The meeting believed that the task of basically completing Vietnam's economic recovery work includes three aspects: First, restoring production to the 1939 level; Second, continuously consolidating and developing the socialist economic components, and gradually adjusting and transforming private and individual economic components; Third, basically stabilizing the economic situation to create favorable conditions for transitioning into the planned construction stage.

The meeting held that, in order to ensure the completion of the 1957 National Plan, it is essential to mainly develop production and practice thrift, paying particular attention to: enhancing labor discipline; gradually implementing the economic accounting system in state-owned enterprises; launching a campaign to increase production and practice thrift; and opposing corruption and waste.

While developing production and practicing thrift, it is necessary to strictly enforce financial discipline, correctly implement the national revenue and expenditure plan, use a combination of economic, administrative, and educational methods to manage the market and prices; study and formulate plans for adjusting staffing levels; and study the implementation of new salary systems and production bonus systems, and so on.

Regarding the issue of building the army and consolidating national defense, the communiqué stated that the current task of the entire party, the entire army, and the entire people is to actively strive to continue to realize and victoriously complete the plan for building the army and consolidating national defense. In 1957, it is necessary to do a good job in the all-army political rectification; prepare to gradually implement the compulsory military service system, military rank system, etc.; build up reserve forces and consolidate the militia; and strengthen the leadership of the Party and the government in building the army and consolidating national defense.
