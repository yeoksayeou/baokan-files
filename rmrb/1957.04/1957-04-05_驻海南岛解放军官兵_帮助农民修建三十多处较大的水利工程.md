Xinhua News Agency, Haikou, 4th. PLA officers and soldiers of the Army and Navy stationed on Hainan Island have helped agricultural production cooperatives on the island build more than 30 large-scale water conservancy projects, most of which were completed by yesterday. Since the leading organs of the Hainan Island garrison issued an urgent directive to actively support agricultural production and strive for a bumper harvest this year, all organs, troops, and schools of the island garrison have suspended training and work for sixteen days from March 26th and devoted themselves to this battle. Leading organs at all levels have organized water conservancy project headquarters, and the heads of troops have personally directed operations at the construction sites.

A certain engineering unit, with fifteen vehicles and two generators, traveled a long distance to the Jiatan Reservoir construction site in Chengmai County to support the construction of this largest water conservancy project on Hainan Island. The total water storage capacity of Jiatan Reservoir is more than 36.8 million cubic meters, which can irrigate more than 78,000 mu of farmland in the surrounding 17 townships. After completion, it will increase grain production by 190,000 dan per year in the 17 townships that have suffered poor harvests every year in the past. Due to the participation of a certain engineering unit in the construction, this reservoir can be completed ahead of schedule, and 50,000 yuan in construction costs can be saved. A certain unit stationed in the Tunchang area participated in the construction of the 18-li-long Qingtan Dam, and from March 17th to April 2nd, it excavated and backfilled more than 126,000 cubic meters of earth. A certain unit stationed in the Wenchang area contributed more than 70,000 workdays and built more than ten small water conservancy projects.

In supporting farmers in building water conservancy projects, officers and soldiers of various units were very enthusiastic and launched labor competitions. The heads of the troops directed the work on the construction site while participating in digging mud and carrying soil. Many family members of officers, hospital nurses, and demobilized construction soldiers who were about to leave the team also actively participated in the labor.

    驻海南岛解放军官兵
    帮助农民修建三十多处较大的水利工程
    新华社海口4日电　驻守在海南岛的中国人民解放军陆军、海军各部队官兵，帮助岛上农业生产合作社修建的三十多处较大的水利工程，到昨天已经大部竣工。自从海南岛驻军领导机关发出积极支援农业生产、争取今年农业大丰收的紧急指示以后，岛上驻军各机关、部队、学校从3月26日起全部停止训练和工作十六天，紧张地投入了这场战斗。各级领导机关都组织了水利工程指挥部，部队首长亲临工地指挥。
    某工兵部队带了十五辆汽车和两部发电机，长途跋涉到澄迈县加潭水库工地，支援这个海南岛最大的水利工程建设。加潭水库的总容水量是三千六百八十多万立方公尺，可灌溉周围十七个乡七万八千多亩田，竣工后，将使过去年年歉收的十七个乡每年增产十九万担粮食。这个水库由于某工兵部队参加修建，可以提前完工，还可以节省五万元修建费。驻屯昌地区某部参加修建长十八里的清滩水坝，从3月17日到4月2日，共挖土、填土十二万六千多立方公尺。驻文昌地区某部共出工七万多个劳动日，修建小型水利十多处。
    在支援农民兴修水利中，各部队官兵热情很高，并且展开了劳动竞赛。部队首长们在工地上一面指挥，一面参加挖泥、挑土。许多军官家属、医院护士和将要离队的复员建设军人，也都积极参加了劳动。
