    Relying on the Masses to Run Schools Collectively
    Gansu Province has More Than 3,000 Mass-Run Primary Schools, Accommodating More Than 160,000 Students

    (Our Correspondent Gu Lei reports) Following the policy of mass-run schools and running schools thriftily, Gansu Province now has 3,437 primary schools run collectively by the masses, accommodating 165,577 students.

    Developing mass-run schools is an effective way to meet the cultural demands of the broad masses, especially the vast peasantry. In 1951, the province relied on the masses to develop 1,603 people-run primary schools, accommodating 66,144 students, accounting for 14.85% of the total number of school-age children in the province at that time. Later, the government took over these schools, and coupled with the disaster in 1953, the number of people-run primary schools sharply decreased.

    Afterward, Gansu Province again called on the masses to run schools. The masses took active action. In 1956 alone, the number of such primary schools increased by 2,650 compared to 1955, and the number of students increased by 135,520. In that year, the number of school-age children enrolled in the province accounted for 45.23% of the total number of school-age children, while the students in people-run primary schools accounted for 16.76% of the total number of students enrolled.

    Many mass-run primary schools in Gansu Province borrow temples, ancestral halls, and private houses as school buildings. In some places, farmers also contribute labor to build a few new houses. The schools lack equipment. Some students bring their own desks and stools, or use earthen mounds as desks and stools, or temporarily borrow some furniture from agricultural cooperatives, starting classes first, and then gradually adding equipment when they have money. There are various ways to raise funds: some is paid by whoever's child goes to school, and the shortfall is subsidized by the government or by a small portion from the agricultural cooperative; some calculate the total annual expenses, which are "willingly donated" by the masses, collected at one time, and deposited in the credit cooperative for monthly expenses; some is resolved by the public welfare fund with the consent of all members, or the teachers are credited with work points, and dividends are distributed at the end of the year, or half of the dividends are given and half in cash. The teachers in these schools are mostly intellectuals hired from the countryside, or primary school graduates who have served as teachers in people's schools in agricultural cooperatives, who are sent to the county for training before being employed. In short, the masses run schools thriftily. They do not pay attention to beauty, but only seek to enable their children to go to school. In this way, the economic burden on the masses is very light. The Dongshun Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wushan County runs a complete primary school, with an average burden of 7.3 yuan per student per year, accounting for 2.15% of each household's total annual income.

    Generally speaking, mass-run schools in rural areas facilitate labor production education for students. Children are exposed to a difficult learning environment at school, see the hard work of adults when they return home, and help the cooperative or family with some light work during the holidays. This easily shapes them into people who love thrift and labor.

    According to the experience of Gansu Province, the following issues should be paid attention to when developing mass-run primary schools: (1) The government should help solve the problems of teacher sources, training, etc., when necessary, and should regularly care about the teaching work of these schools to ensure teaching quality; (2) Solve the problem of teaching materials. When continuing to develop such schools in the future, we must prevent two deviations: one is that some people do not believe in the power of the masses, and therefore do not actively promote and develop them, which is to be divorced from the masses; the other is coercion and commandism, subjectively making plans, assigning tasks to various townships and agricultural cooperatives, and setting deadlines for completion, which will ruin good things. Therefore, in order to promote mass-run schools, it is necessary to implement the mass line method, vigorously publicize its benefits, mobilize the masses to voluntarily run schools, without being constrained by formality, and the state only provides assistance when necessary.

    依靠群众集体办学
    甘肃省群众自办小学三千多所容纳学生十六万多人
    本报讯　本报记者顾雷报道：根据群众办学、勤俭办学的方针，甘肃省现在群众集体办的小学已达三千四百三十七所，可容纳学生十六万五千五百七十七人。
    发展群众集体办学，是满足广大群众、特别是广大农民对文化要求的一个有效的方法。1951年，全省依靠群众发展了民办小学一千六百零三所，收容学生六万六千一百四十四人，占当时全省入学儿童总数的14.85％。以后，政府接办了这些学校，加上1953年受灾，致使民办小学数字锐减。
    以后，甘肃省又号召群众办学。群众积极行动起来了。1956年一年内，这种小学比1955年增加了二千六百五十所，学生增加十三万五千五百二十人。这一年，全省入学儿童占学龄儿童45.23％，而民办小学的学生占入学儿童总数的16.76％。
    甘肃省许多群众集体办的小学，校舍是借用的庙宇、祠堂和民房，有的地方农民也献工盖几间新房子。学校里没有设备，有的学生自带桌凳，或者用泥土修些墩子当桌凳用，或是暂借农业社一点家具，先开课，以后有了钱再逐步添置。出经费的办法是多种多样的：有的是谁家孩子上学谁出钱，不足的部分由政府补助或由农业社补助一小部分；有的是算出全年的开支总额，由群众“乐捐”，一次筹足，存在信用合作社里，按月开支；有的是经过全体社员同意，由公益金解决，或者给教师记工分，到年底分红，有的是分一半红给一半现金。这些学校的教师，大都是聘请的在乡里的知识分子，或者是在农业社担任过民校教师的小学毕业生，送到县里加以训练后充当。总之，群众都是用勤俭办法办学，他们不讲究漂亮，只求孩子能上学就行。这样，群众经济负担很轻。武山县东顺农业生产合作社办了个完全小学，平均每个学生每年分担七元三角，占每户全年总收入的2.15％。
    乡村群众集体办学，一般地说便于对学生进行劳动生产教育。孩子们在学校接触的是艰苦的学习环境，回家后看到的是大人们辛勤的劳动，假期里要帮助合作社或家庭做一些轻微活。这样容易把他们陶冶成一个爱勤俭、爱劳动的人。
    发展群众集体办的小学，据甘肃省的经验，要注意下面一些问题：（一）政府在必要时帮助解决教师的来源、训练等问题，并且经常关怀这些学校的教学工作，以保证教学质量；（二）解决教材问题。今后继续发展这种学校的时候，要防止两种偏差：一种是某些人不相信群众的力量，因而不积极去宣传，不积极发展，这是脱离群众的；另一种是强迫命令，主观地搞规划，给各乡、农业社分配任务，限期完成，这样，反会把好事情办坏。因之，为了推动群众集体办学，需要贯彻执行群众路线的方法，大力宣传它的好处，发动群众自愿兴办，不拘形式，国家只在必要的时候给予协助。
