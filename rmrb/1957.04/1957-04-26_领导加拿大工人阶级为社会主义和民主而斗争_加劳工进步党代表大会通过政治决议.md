    Leading the Canadian Working Class to Fight for Socialism and Democracy
    Labor-Progressive Party of Canada Congress Passes Political Resolution

    The Sixth Congress of the Labor-Progressive Party of Canada, held in Toronto, closed on the 22nd. At the closing session, a political resolution was adopted, along with a new party constitution, approval of the party's election platform, and the election of the party's national committee.

    The political resolution stated: The Labor-Progressive Party is loyal to the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and is deeply convinced that the Labor-Progressive Party can lead the Canadian working class in the struggle for socialism, democracy, and peace. It is wholeheartedly committed to defending the interests of Canada and the Canadian people. Its goal is to build socialism in Canada through peaceful parliamentary means, and to build a country and social system with the working class playing a decisive leadership role.

    Striving for the withdrawal of Canadian troops and all foreign troops from the territory of European countries, and actively supporting proposals to ban nuclear weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction, should become the basis of Canadian foreign policy. The party supports the proposal for NATO countries and Warsaw Pact member states to conclude a non-aggression pact within the framework of a pan-European security system.

    The resolution also stated that Canada should advocate for gradual disarmament, recognize the People's Republic of China and strive for the restoration of the People's Republic of China's rights in the United Nations, and advocate for the peaceful resolution of all international disputes within the framework of the United Nations.

    The resolution analyzed the Canadian economy, pointing out that the current economic "prosperity" is primarily the "prosperity" of monopoly capitalists. The real wages of workers and the income of farmers lag behind the increase in labor productivity and the rate of increase in consumer goods prices. (Xinhua News Agency report)

    领导加拿大工人阶级为社会主义和民主而斗争
    加劳工进步党代表大会通过政治决议
    在多伦多举行的加拿大劳工进步党第六次代表大会已经在22日闭幕。在闭幕会议上通过了政治决议，还通过了新党章，批准了党的竞选纲领，选出了党的全国委员会。
    政治决议指出：劳工进步党忠于马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的原则，深信劳工进步党能够领导加拿大工人阶级争取社会主义、民主和和平的斗争。它全心全意致力于保卫加拿大和加拿大人民的利益。它的目的是：用和平的议会方式在加拿大建成社会主义，建成一个由工人阶级起决定性领导作用的国家和社会制度。
    争取加拿大军队和一切外国军队撤出欧洲国家的领土以及积极支持禁止核武器和其他一切大规模毁灭性武器的建议，应当成为加拿大外交政策的基础。党支持关于北大西洋公约组织国家和华沙条约参加国在全欧安全体系的范围内缔结互不侵犯公约的建议。
    决议还说，加拿大应当主张逐步裁减军备、承认中华人民共和国和争取恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的权利，并且主张在联合国的范围内和平解决一切国际争端。
    决议对加拿大的经济作了分析，它指出，目前的经济“繁荣”首先是垄断资本家的“繁荣”。工人的实际工资和农民的收入落后于劳动生产率提高的水平和消费品价格上涨的速度。　（据新华社讯）
