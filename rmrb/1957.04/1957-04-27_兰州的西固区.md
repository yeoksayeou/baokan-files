New City Moving Forward

　　The Xigu District of Lanzhou
　　Zhang Ming Sun Jing

　　Lanzhou leans against the mountains and faces the water, stretching sixty kilometers east to west. It has several river valley plains of varying sizes distributed on both banks of the Yellow River, some of which have been planned as emerging industrial areas. The Xigu District is one of the earliest and largest of these industrial areas.

　　Recently, we visited this new industrial area.

　　The Xigu District covers an area of thirty-one square kilometers, and magnificent construction scenes can be seen everywhere. Originally, this was farmland, wasteland, and sparse villages. Since the factory construction department built the first building in 1955, there have been nearly a hundred buildings. Many farms have been relocated, replaced by giant factories. The newly opened roads in this new industrial area crisscross, with a total length of more than forty kilometers. The north-south avenue, which is connected to the east-west main road, leads directly to the Yellow River. From there, crossing the Yellow River bridge, you reach another emerging industrial area in Lanzhou. This bridge is one of the four new iron bridges over the Yellow River newly built in Lanzhou. Now, the building materials needed by the Xigu District are generally transported from the north side of the Yellow River through this bridge. Xigu District not only has a network of roads but has also built a railway loop line. The Lanxin Railway passes through the southern part of Xigu District. The loop railway starts from one end of the Lanxin Road, draws a large arc to the north, and then returns to the other end of the Lanxin Road. Several large factories under construction are arranged on the loop line, and building materials from other places can be sent directly to each factory along the loop line. Currently, Lanzhou's passenger trains are already running on this loop line, taking construction workers to the construction site in the morning and back to the dormitory in the evening. The factories currently under construction in Xigu District are all quite large. The oil refinery has the most equipment in terms of pipes, oil tanks, and pumps. Its underground pipelines are like spider webs, with the densest place having more than seventy pipes, overlapping six or seven layers. The degree of automation in this factory is difficult to explain in a few words. For example, it has more than two thousand sets of instruments, including hundreds of electric clocks. The effectiveness of these devices is: large refining capacity, many new products, and high crude oil utilization rate. Petroleum products that China cannot currently produce will be refined in this factory. The Lanzhou Water Plant here is currently the largest water plant in the country. The water source of this water plant is not taken from the ground but from the Yellow River. Because the turbidity of the Yellow River water is very high, this determines the construction scale of the water plant and the complex process of treating water. How much water does the Lanzhou Water Plant supply? You can imagine it by looking at the free-flowing ditch. Its two free-flowing ditches are the same size, and Jeeps can drive inside.

　　We visited the water plant project on the bank of the Yellow River. The pump station construction site was bustling with activity. The pump station, constructed of six to seven thousand cubic meters of concrete, emerged from more than ten meters underground like a huge monster. Workers were tying the reinforcing steel for the ground part. When visiting the oil refinery, we drove the car into the construction site because the factory area was too large. We saw the completed desalination and dehydration workshop, and some of the refining towers in some workshops had already been erected high. The oil tank group, stretching for several miles, shone brightly in the sun. More than ten kilometers of railway in the factory have been laid, and the unloading station has been put into use long ago. During the visit, we deeply felt that the construction scale of Xigu District is magnificent and the construction is rapid. As people say, if you leave the construction site one day, you will not be able to find your way the next day!

　　After visiting the factory, we went to the employee welfare area. The welfare area is south of the factories, about four miles away from the factories. It is more than six kilometers long from east to west. The prototypes of several streets have been formed. On the utility poles at the intersections, you can see such signs: "May 1st Road," "Welfare Road"... Petroleum School, Chemical School, and Geological School are building school buildings. Petroleum School has already started classes. According to the plan of Xigu District, department stores, hospitals, nurseries, etc. will also be built here in the future. A comrade from the Xigu District Committee of the Communist Party of China told us that Xigu District currently has one hundred and twenty-five trade outposts, and there are simple bathhouses and theaters. A semi-permanent workers' club is about to be completed. To make the environment more hygienic, shelterbelts will be cultivated between factories and between factories and residential areas. It is conceivable that Xigu District will be a green "satellite city" of Lanzhou.

　　Going south from the welfare area, there is a dirt terrace called Liugou Daping. There are more than two thousand acres of land on the terrace. In the past, due to drought, although farmers cultivated it, they did not expect it to produce much grain. Now, it has become one of the relocation areas in Lanzhou. The township head told us that their five hundred households used to live in Xigu Chuan, relying on a river flowing down from the valley southwest of the terrace for irrigation. Last year, the government invested in helping to change the river to the terrace and built a reservoir at the same time. Therefore, dry land became paddy fields. The township head said with a smile: People and the river moved together, and the farmers are very happy. This year, they will try to grow vegetables on the terrace. It is estimated that if all the land on this terrace is planted with vegetables, it can supply the Xigu District employees. (Attached photo)

### 兰州的西固区

    兰州的西固区
    张鸣　孙晶
    兰州依山带水，东西长达六十公里。她有大小不等的几块河谷平原分布在黄河两岸，其中有几块已经规划为新兴的工业区。西固区就是这些工业区中建设较早和规模较大的一个。
    最近，我们访问了这个新工业区。
    西固区的面积有三十一平方公里，到处都可以看到宏伟的建设场面。这里原来是农田荒地和稀疏的村舍，自从1955年工厂筹建部门盖起第一座楼房，到现在已经有近百幢建筑。许多农庄迁移了，代替它们的是巨型的工厂。这个新工业区内刚开拓的马路纵横交叉，总长度约有四十多公里。同东西主干马路相衔接的南北大道，一直通到黄河边，从那里跨过黄河便桥，就到了兰州的另一块新兴工业区。这座桥是兰州市区新修的四座黄河铁桥之一，现在西固区需要的地方建筑材料，一般都通过这座桥从黄河北面运来。西固区不但马路成网，而且已经修好了一条铁路环行线。兰新铁路从西固区的南半部穿过，环形铁路就是从兰新路的一端开始，向北画了一个大圆弧，然后再回到兰新路的另一端。正在建设的几座大工厂都排列在环形线上，外地来的建筑材料可以顺环形线一直送到各工厂。现在兰州市的旅客列车已经在这条环形线上行驶，早上把建筑职工送到工地，晚间再接回宿舍。西固区目前建设的几座工厂规模都相当大。炼油厂最多的设备是管子、油罐、泵。它的地下管道真像是蜘蛛网一样，管子最密的地方有七十多条，上下重叠六、七层。这个工厂自动化的程度很难用几句话说清楚，例如，它的仪表就有二千多套。其中仅电钟就有几百个。这些设备的效能是：炼油量大，新产品多，原油利用率高。我国现在不能生产的石油产品，将从这个工厂里炼制出来。这里的兰州自来水厂，是目前全国最大的水厂。这个自来水厂的水源不是取自地下，而是来自黄河。由于黄河水的混浊度很大，这就决定了这座水厂的建设规模和处理水的复杂过程。兰州自来水厂的供水量有多大？只要看看自流沟就可以想像出来。它的两条一样大小的自流沟，里面可以开行吉普车。
    我们到黄河边上参观了自来水厂工程。泵站工地上热火朝天，由六、七千方混凝土构筑的泵站像一个庞然怪物，从十几公尺的地下冒出来，工人们正在绑扎地面部分的钢筋。参观炼油厂的时候，我们曾把汽车开进工地去，因为厂地太大了。我们看到了已经完工的脱盐脱水车间，有些车间的炼塔已经高高地竖立起来。长达几里地的油罐群，在太阳照射下闪闪发光。厂内十多公里的铁路已经敷设好，卸货站早已启用。在参观访问中，我们深深感到西固区的建设规模宏伟，建设迅速，正像人们所说的，头一天离开工地，第二天再来就找不到路了！
    参观过工厂以后，我们又到职工福利区去。福利区在各工厂的南面，同工厂相距约四里地。它的东西长达六公里多。有几条街道的雏形已经形成，在交叉路口的电线杆上可以看到这样的标示牌：“五一路”、“福利路”……石油学校、化工学校、地质学校正在建设校舍，石油学校现在已经开学。根据西固区的规划，将来这里还要建设百货大楼，医院，托儿所等。中共西固区委会的一位同志告诉我们，西固区现有贸易据点一百二十五个，简易浴室和剧院都有了，一座半永久性的工人俱乐部快要完工。为了使环境更加卫生，在工厂和工厂之间，工厂和住宅区之间，将要培植防护林带。可以想见，西固区将是兰州市的一个绿色的“卫星城”。
    从福利区向南去，有一块土坪，叫做柳沟大坪。坪上有两千多亩地，从前由于干旱的缘故，农民虽然耕种它，却不指望它打多少粮食。现在，那里已经成为兰州市的迁建区之一。乡长对我们说，他们那里五百多户居民，原来住在西固川上，依靠土坪西南面山谷里流下来的一条河水灌溉，去年政府投资帮助把这条河改到土坪上来，同时修了一座水库，于是旱地变成了水田。乡长微笑着说：人和河一齐搬家，农民们都很高兴。今年他们要在坪上试种蔬菜，估计将这块坪上的地全种成菜，可以供西固区职工吃用。（附图片）
