Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 6th: People in Kerala and other parts of India, including New Delhi, enthusiastically celebrated the establishment of the Kerala government led by the Communist Party of India on the 5th.

    As the swearing-in ceremony of the new Kerala government was held at the Governor's office in Trivandrum on the afternoon of the 5th, a large crowd gathered outside the Governor's office, chanting slogans. It is said that the streets leading to the Governor's office were filled with workers and farmers from distant villages, young and old alike, cheering for the newly born government. Red flags fluttered on all buildings and lampposts.

    Thousands of congratulatory letters from all walks of life in Kerala flooded the new government's office, expressing their joy and offering suggestions. Some letters called for the new government to eliminate the corruption that existed in the past.

    Across India, the Communist Party of India joined the people in holding rallies and mass meetings to celebrate the day, calling it "Kerala Day."

    In New Delhi, several thousand workers, citizens of Delhi, and Communist Party members held a large-scale rally at the Gandhi Samadhi in the evening to celebrate "Kerala Day." Goswami and Vice Chairman of the All-India Peace Council, Sundarlal, spoke at the meeting.

    In his speech, Goswami called on the Indian central government to fully cooperate with the Communist Party-led Kerala government and not discriminate against it, so that the new government could better serve the people of Kerala.

    He said that the Communist Party of India in Kerala would do the things that the Congress Party had promised but had not implemented in the past ten years.

    Today, all newspapers prominently published the news of the establishment of the new Kerala government and Namboodiripad's speech on the front page. The latest issue of the "New Age" weekly also published a special issue on Kerala.

    印度各地人民欢欣鼓舞
    庆祝喀拉拉邦新政府诞生
    新华社新德里6日电　印度喀拉拉邦和新德里等其它地方的人民，5日热烈庆祝印度共产党领导的喀拉拉邦政府的成立。
    当5日下午喀拉拉邦新政府的宣誓典礼在特里凡得琅的邦长办公厅进行时，大批的人群聚集在邦长办公厅的外面，高呼着口号。据说，通向邦长办公厅的街道上挤满了工人和来自远地村庄的农民，老老少少都为新诞生的政府欢呼。红旗飘扬在所有的建筑物和电灯杆上。
    喀拉拉邦各界人民发出的成千封贺信像雪片一般地飞向新政府办公厅，喀拉拉人民在贺信中表示了他们的高兴，并且提出了建议。有些信中要求新政府肃清以前存在的贪污。
    在印度各地，印度共产党同人民一起举行集会和群众大会庆祝这一天，并且把这一天叫作“喀拉拉日”。
    在新德里，有几千名工人、德里市民和共产党员晚上在甘地墓地举行大规模集会，庆祝“喀拉拉日”，高士和全印和平理事会副主席森德拉尔在会上讲了话。
    高士在讲话中要求印度中央政府同共产党领导的喀拉拉邦政府充分合作而不要对它有所歧视，以使这个新政府能够很好地为喀拉拉邦人民服务。
    他说，印度共产党在喀拉拉邦将做那些国大党曾经允诺过但在过去十年内并没有实行的事情。
    今天所有报纸都在第一版以显著地位刊载了喀拉拉邦新政府成立的消息和南布迪里巴德的讲话。最近一期“新世纪”周报还出版了关于喀拉拉邦的专刊。
