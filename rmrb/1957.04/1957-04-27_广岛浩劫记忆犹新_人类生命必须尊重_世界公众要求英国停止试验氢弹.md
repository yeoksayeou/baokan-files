Xinhua News Agency dispatch reports that recently, the call from people around the world to stop hydrogen bomb tests and conclude an agreement on the abolition of nuclear weapons has been rising.

The French newspaper "Le Monde" published on the 23rd the script of a radio speech by the famous French scientist Joliot-Curie advocating an immediate halt to nuclear weapons testing.

The Nobel Prize winner, former French High Commissioner for Atomic Energy, said: "We cannot erase the terrible memories of the catastrophe caused by the atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, nor can we erase the memories of hydrogen bomb explosion tests that are thousands of times more powerful than atomic bombs." He said that if any agreement on the abolition of atomic weapons is to be reached, these explosion tests must be stopped immediately. He believes that if hydrogen bomb explosion tests around the world are not stopped, radioactive elements in the atmosphere will cause bone cancer and leukemia.

The famous French physician, philosopher, Protestant theologian, and musician Dr. Albert Schweitzer also delivered a radio address on the Norwegian radio network on the evening of the 23rd in five languages, appealing for an end to atomic bomb test explosions. The 1952 Nobel Peace Prize winner said that his appeal is based on the principle of "respect for life" because such explosions are a danger to mankind and will subject future generations to radiation damage.

Former French Prime Minister Edgar Faure (Chairman of the "Left Republican Union," one of the French opposition parties) called on the 25th for an immediate halt to nuclear weapons testing. Faure said, "Every country must stop before embarking on the road to death."

Dr. Gerstenmaier, President of the West German Federal Parliament, said in an interview with the "Stuttgart Daily" on the 25th that he welcomed Schweitzer's appeal and suggested that NATO countries should stop nuclear weapons tests.

Former Governor-General of India, Rajagopalachari, said in a letter published in the "New Statesman and Nation" magazine on the 25th that testing hydrogen bombs is a great crime and should be stopped at all costs. He demanded that India withdraw from the Commonwealth as a measure to stop British hydrogen bomb tests.

Nunez, Director of the Biology and Medicine Department of the Argentine Atomic Energy Commission, expressed opposition to nuclear explosion tests on April 22nd. He said: The world is currently at a crossroads, and it must choose whether to continue conducting atomic explosion tests that will pollute the atmosphere for a long time.

Former Chief Minister of Singapore, Marshall, said on the 24th that he was very concerned about the potential impact of radiation hazards on Singapore residents and their food supply when Britain was about to conduct a hydrogen bomb test on Christmas Island. He emphasized that the Japanese people were deeply disturbed by such tests.

British social groups and some newspapers continue to oppose hydrogen bomb tests. The British-Soviet Friendship Association issued a statement on the 24th calling on the British government to "accept the Soviet Union's proposal and join the Soviet Union in calling on the United States to agree to stop all future nuclear weapons tests."

The Liberal Party's "News Chronicle" demanded on the 24th that the government take the initiative to stop nuclear weapons tests first. The newspaper advocated fully mobilizing public opinion to force the government to change its attitude on this issue. The Labor Party's "Daily Herald" also demanded on the 24th that the government postpone the Christmas Island test in the face of world opinion. The "National Committee for the Abolition of Nuclear Weapons" decided to hold a mass women's march in central London on May 12th to protest the planned hydrogen bomb test on Christmas Island.

    广岛浩劫记忆犹新　人类生命必须尊重
    世界公众要求英国停止试验氢弹
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息，最近，世界各国人民要求停止氢弹试验，缔结关于废除原子核武器协议的呼声日益高涨。
    法国“世界报”23日登载了法国著名科学家约里奥—居里主张立即停止核武器试验的广播演说稿。
    这位诺贝尔奖金得奖人，前法国原子能高级专员说：“我们不能消除原子弹在广岛和长崎所造成的浩劫的可怕的回忆，也不能消除比原子弹威力大千万倍的氢弹爆炸试验的回忆。”他说，如果要达成关于废除原子武器的任何协议，必须立即停止这些爆炸试验。他认为，世界上的氢弹爆炸试验如不停止，大气里的放射性因素将造成骨癌和白血病。
    著名的法国医学家、哲学家、新教神学家和音乐家艾伯特·施维泽尔博士23日晚也在挪威电台网用五国语言发表广播演说，吁请结束原子弹试验性爆炸。这位1952年诺贝尔和平奖金的获得者说，他的呼吁是根据“尊重生命”的原则。因为这种爆炸对人类是一个危险，它将使人类后代受到放射线的伤害。
    前法国总理埃加·富尔（法国反对党之一“左翼共和联盟”主席）25日呼吁立即停止核武器试验。富尔说，“每一个国家都必须在踏上死亡的道路以前止步”。
    西德联邦议院主席格斯登美尔博士25日在向“斯图加特日报”记者谈话时表示欢迎施维泽尔的呼吁，并建议北大西洋公约组织国家应该停止原子核武器试验。
    前印度总督拉贾戈帕拉查里25日在“新政治家与民族”杂志上发表的一封信中说，试验氢弹是一种莫大的罪行。应尽力去制止。他要求印度退出英联邦，作为阻止英国氢弹试验的一个措施。
    阿根廷原子能委员会的生物和医学部主任努涅斯在4月22日表示反对进行原子核爆炸试验。他说：世界目前处在十字路口，它必须选择是不是要继续进行将长期毒化大气的原子爆炸试验。
    新加坡前任首席部长马歇尔24日说，英国在圣诞岛将要举行氢弹试验，他很担心放射线的毒害对新加坡居民和他们的食物供应可能产生的影响。他着重指出日本人民对这样的试验深感不安。
    英国的社会团体和一些报纸继续反对氢弹试验。英苏友好协会24日发表声明，呼吁英国政府“接受苏联的建议并同苏联一道呼吁美国同意停止今后一切核武器的试验”。
    自由党的“新闻纪事报”24日要求政府采取主动首先停止核武器试验。这家报纸主张充分动员舆论，以迫使政府改变在这个问题上的态度。工党的“每日先驱报”24日也要求政府在世界舆论面前首先推迟圣诞岛试验。“废除核武器全国委员会”决定在5月12日在伦敦市中心举行一次群众性的妇女游行，抗议预定在圣诞岛举行的氢弹试验。
