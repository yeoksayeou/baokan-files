    Educated Youth, Build a New Socialist Countryside!
    The Voices of More Than Seven Thousand Recent Graduates
    Jiang Hu
    "If I can't go to college, I'll participate in agricultural production." This has become the prevailing sentiment among more than seven thousand graduating middle school students in Changsha City, Hunan Province. Wang Qingliang, a student at the Fifth Middle School, has already written to his hometown agricultural cooperative and his father, explaining that if he cannot go to college after graduation, he will return to the agricultural cooperative to engage in agricultural production. He has now received a reply supporting his idea from the agricultural cooperative. Liao Meifu, a student at the First Middle School, wrote to his brother, saying, "Participating in agricultural labor is my second choice. If I don't get into school, I will go home to produce." Zhang Yulai, a graduating senior from this school and the son of a carpenter, has already discussed with his father that if he cannot go to college after graduation, he will learn carpentry from his father. He Chunlian, a student at the Ninth Middle School, has planned that, if necessary, she can return to the agricultural cooperative to be a pig breeder. Many students have written the following in their compositions and diaries: Obey the needs of the motherland, be a first-generation cultured farmer, and work in the countryside for a lifetime.
    This is a significant change in the thinking of graduating students in various middle schools in Changsha. A month ago, students generally had unrealistic expectations of being able to go to college after graduation, and generally held the mistaken view that participating in agricultural labor was "lowly" and "unpromising." Many students burned the midnight oil to catch up on their studies. This caused a period of confusion and tension in both thought and learning.
    In order to strengthen ideological and political work in schools, the Changsha Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China established a student work group in mid-March to specifically lead and strengthen ideological and political education and labor education in various middle and primary schools. After the widespread study and discussion of the People's Daily editorial "On the Issue of Middle and Primary School Graduates Participating in Agricultural Production," the students' incorrect ideological understandings began to change. During the spring break, many schools organized students to visit the countryside, further establishing a correct understanding of college enrollment and participation in agricultural production among the students. The phenomenon of excessive tension in learning has now been eliminated among most students, and their study and life have returned to normal.

    知识青年们，建设社会主义新农村！
    七千多名应届毕业生的声音

    “如果不能升学，就参加农业生产。”这已经成为湖南省长沙市七千多名应届中学毕业生的普遍舆论。第五中学学生王清亮，已给家乡的农业社和父亲写信，说明毕业后如不能升学，就回到农业社从事农业生产，现在他已接到回信，农业社支持他的主张。第一中学学生廖美福写信给哥哥说：“参加农业劳动是我的第二志愿。如考不取学校就回家生产。”这个学校有个木工的儿子、应届高中班毕业生张玉来，已经和父亲协商好，毕业后若不能升学，就向父亲学习木工。第九中学学生何春莲已经计划好在必要时，可以回到农业社当一名生猪饲养员。有很多学生在作文、日记里写下这样的话：服从祖国的需要，做一个第一代有文化的农民，在农村干一辈子。
    这是长沙市各中学应届毕业生思想上重大的变化。一个月前，学生们还普遍存在着毕业后能全部升学的不切合实际情况的要求，也普遍存在着认为参加农业劳动是“下贱”、“没出息”的错误看法；很多学生为了赶功课，就开夜车。在思想上和学习上都造成一度的混乱和紧张。
    中共长沙市委为加强对学校中的思想政治工作，在3月中旬成立了学生工作组，具体领导和加强各中、小学的思想政治教育和劳动教育工作。在普遍学习和讨论人民日报“关于中小学毕业生参加农业生产问题”的社论以后，学生中那些不正确的思想认识有所转变。春假期间，许多学校又组织学生到农村参观，使广大学生对于升学和参加农业生产问题，进一步树立了正确的认识。现在大部分学生在学习上过分紧张的现象已经消除，学习生活都转入正常状态。
