    Advanced Experiences Spread Everywhere: Mountainous Areas Greatly Change
    200 "Daquanshan" Appear in Yanbei Area
    (Our newspaper dispatch) According to a report by Shanxi Daily reporter Yao Wenjin: In the first year after cooperativization, the Yanbei area achieved great success in soil and water conservation. According to a recent survey, there are already 201 places where the scale and quality of soil and water conservation work are sufficient to catch up with Daquanshan. In these places, 2,454 gullies have been treated to prevent soil from running down slopes and water from leaving the gullies, initially controlling soil erosion over an area of 2,282,759 mu. This figure is equivalent to one and a half times the total controlled area completed in all previous years after liberation.
    Daquanshan, known as the "Soil and Water Conservation University" by Yanbei farmers, trained many "soil and water conservation experts" last year. In the spring and summer seasons alone, 2,708 grassroots cadres and farmers from various counties went there to study in organized groups. Under the direct guidance of Zhang Fenglin and Gao Jincai, they conducted experiments and learned a complete set of experiences. They then trained 20,050 new technicians. Last summer, the Daquanshan Agricultural Cooperative also sent 44 "soil and water conservation consultants" to provide comprehensive assistance to key townships and cooperatives in nine nearby counties, from planning and design to organizing construction.
    Based on the advanced experience of Daquanshan, various localities generally implemented the principles of centralized treatment, comprehensive treatment, and continuous treatment on the basis of overall planning. Taking the tributary and branch gully basin as a unit, the entire area was treated from top to bottom according to the laws of soil and water loss in each area, ensuring that one slope was treated and completed, and one gully was treated and completed. In terms of labor organization, various localities also widely promoted the Daquanshan Agricultural Cooperative’s advanced experience of "combining phased concentrated efforts with year-round construction." There are already 1,024 cooperatives in the region that have established specialized basic construction teams, with 29,573 laborers participating, carrying out basic construction work for soil and water conservation throughout the year. During the four slack farming periods before spring plowing, after spring plowing, before autumn harvest, and after autumn harvest, the entire or most of the cooperative members are mobilized to concentrate on basic construction work for soil and water conservation. At this time, members of the basic construction team serve as technicians in each team. After the concentrated effort is completed, the members of the basic construction team are solely responsible for the repair and maintenance of basic construction projects.
    When carrying out soil and water conservation work, the Yanbei area also followed Zhang Fenglin and Gao Jincai’s experience of "combining the near and far, and obtaining two benefits," generally starting with places that require less labor, yield greater benefits, and produce quicker results. Last year, the region increased grain production by more than 3,568,000 jin from soil and water conservation projects alone, with an average income of 1.57 jin of grain for each labor day invested in basic construction. In addition, soil and water conservation also increased cultivated land by 56,640 mu and expanded the irrigated area by 169,930 mu.

### 先进经验到处传　山区面貌大改变  雁北地区出现二百个“大泉山”

    先进经验到处传　山区面貌大改变
    雁北地区出现二百个“大泉山”
    本报讯　据山西日报记者姚文锦报道：在合作化后的第一年里，雁北区的水土保持工作获得巨大的成就。据最近调查，水土保持工作的规模质量足以赶上大泉山的已经有了二百零一处。这些地方，已经有二千四百五十四道沟壑，作到土不下坡，水不出沟，初步控制水土流失面积二百二十八万二千七百五十九亩。这个数字相当于解放后历年来完成的总控制面积的一倍半。
    被雁北农民称为“水保大学”的大泉山，去年一年内训练出许多“水保行家”。仅春夏二季各县有组织去那里学习的基层干部和农民，即达二千七百零八人。他们在张凤林、高进才的直接指导下，进行了试验操作，学会了一套完整的经验。又经他们培养出新的技术人员二万零五十人。去年夏季，大泉山农业社还派出四十四名“水保顾问”，对附近九个县的重点乡社，从规划设计到组织施工，进行了全面的帮助。
    根据大泉山的先进经验，各地一般都在全面规划的基础上，实行了集中治、综合治、连续治的方针。以支毛沟流域为单位，根据各该地区水土流失的规律，由上到下全面治理，作到治一坡，成一坡，治一沟，成一沟。在劳力组织上各地又普遍推广了大泉山农业社“分段突击常年建设相结合”的先进经验。全区已有一千零二十四个社建立专业性的基本建设队，参加的劳力有二万九千五百七十三人，常年进行水土保持的基本建设工作；在春扒前、春扒后、秋收前、秋收后的四个农闲段落，则动员全体或大部社员力量突击水土保持的基本建设工作。这时基建队的队员分别到各队担任技术员。当突击终了以后，基建队的队员便专门负责基本建设工程的修补与养护。
    雁北地区在进行水土保持工作时，还根据张凤林、高进才“远近结合、二利皆获”的经验，一般都是先从用工少，收益大，见效快的地方作起。去年全区只从水土保持工程上就增产粮食三百五十六万八千多斤，每个投入基本建设的劳动日平均收入粮食一斤五两七。此外，还结合水土保持增加耕地五万六千六百四十亩，扩大了灌溉面积十六万九千九百三十亩。
