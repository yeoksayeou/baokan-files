	Bulgaria's First Blast Furnace Put Into Production
	Bulgaria's first iron-smelting blast furnace was officially put into production at the "Lenin" National Metallurgical Factory near Dimitrovgrad on the 29th. Its annual output is approximately 113,000 tons, equivalent to half of the pig iron required by the "Lenin" National Metallurgical Factory.

	Cambodian San Yun Cabinet Resigns
	Cambodian Prime Minister San Yun submitted the collective resignation of his cabinet to King Suramarit on the 28th, because the National Assembly had submitted a motion of no confidence. The motion of no confidence passed by the National Assembly on the 27th strongly opposed the economic and financial policies of the San Yun cabinet.

	Pibul Announces Formation of New Cabinet
	Thai leader of the Seri Manangkasila Party, Plaek Phibunsongkhram, announced the formation of a new cabinet on the 30th. Most of the members of the previous cabinet will remain, including Minister of Foreign Affairs Wan Waithayakon and Deputy Minister Panya Rachun.

	It is revealed that fierce disputes occurred within the Thai ruling group during this cabinet formation. Plaek Phibunsongkhram had released a cabinet list on the 27th, but this list was rejected by the "Revolutionary Group," which opposed the exclusion of Army Commander Sarit Thanarat from the cabinet. Plaek Phibunsongkhram accepted Sarit Thanarat as Minister of Defense and Commander-in-Chief of the Army in the new list. At the same time, Nai Pao Sriyanond, the Deputy Minister of Interior and Director-General of Police in the previous cabinet, has been promoted to Minister of Interior in the new cabinet.
