Selling Young Livestock to Commune Members for Raising
    Yang Zijian
    In Tangjia District, Xinjin County, Liaoning Province, sixteen townships and thirty-seven agricultural cooperatives have successively sold young cattle and donkeys from the cooperatives to commune members with raising experience on credit. The commune members are very satisfied. He Zhenchang's father from the Taiyangsheng Cooperative, leading back a small cow he had bought on credit, said, "Little cow! I guarantee I will raise you well, and when you grow up, you can work for the cooperative!" Commune members who did not buy livestock also said, "This is the right thing to do, otherwise, in a few years, the cattle and donkeys will be gone completely." Currently, in just the six townships of Hedong, Xichengzi, and Yangshufang, more than six hundred head of young livestock are privately owned by commune members.
    Since the establishment of agricultural cooperatives in this district, some cooperative cadres believed that raising young cattle and donkeys was not cost-effective due to insufficient fodder, wasting labor and feed. Some cooperatives tied the young cattle and donkeys in one pen at night and let them roam freely during the day without anyone taking care of them. As a result, many froze to death or were injured. After the Xinjin County Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a call to strengthen the protection of young livestock, Tangjia District conducted investigations and studies and adopted the measure of private ownership of young livestock.

    把幼畜卖给社员饲养
    杨子江
    辽宁省新金县唐家区十六个乡，三十七个农业社，先后把社里的幼小牛驴作价赊卖给有饲养经验的社员饲养，社员非常满意。太阳升社何振昌的老父亲牵着赊回来的小牛说：“小牛！我保证把你喂好，长大了再给社里干活吧。”没有买着牲畜的社员也说：“这样作太对了，要不，再过几年，牛驴就得断根了。”现在仅河东、西城子、杨树房等六个乡的农业社，就有六百多头小牲畜归社员私有。
    这个区自从成立农业社以后，因为饲草不足，有些社干部认为养小牛小驴不合算，白费人工、白吃草料；有的社把小牛小驴晚间拴在一个圈内，白天到处散逛，无人照顾。结果，冻死伤亡很大。中共新金县委提出加强保护幼小牲畜的号召以后，唐家区作了调查研究，采取了幼畜私有的措施。
