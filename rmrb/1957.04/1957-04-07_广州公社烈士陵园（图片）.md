    The Guangzhou Commune Martyrs' Cemetery is built in the Honghuagang area in the eastern suburbs of Guangzhou. Currently, a portion of the construction on the eastern side of the cemetery has been completed. Around the Qingming Festival, people from all walks of life come to pay their respects and admire the site.
    The Guangzhou Commune was a people's revolutionary regime established in 1927 by the working class and laboring masses of Guangzhou under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party during an armed uprising.

    The martyrs who sacrificed their lives thirty years ago for the establishment of the Guangzhou Commune rest under these evergreen tombs.
    The surroundings of the martyrs' tombs have been planted with "everlasting" pines and cypresses.

    广州公社烈士陵园建筑在广州市东郊红花岗一带。现在，陵园东面的一部分工程已经完工。清明节前后，各界人民纷纷前来祭扫、瞻仰。
    广州公社是广州的工人阶级和劳动群众在中国共产党领导下，于1927年举行武装起义时建立的人民革命政权。
    烈士陵园的东门，前来瞻仰的人川流不息。
    三十年前为建立广州公社而牺牲的烈士们，就安息在这常青的墓冢下。
    在烈士墓的周围已种满了“万古长春”的松柏。
