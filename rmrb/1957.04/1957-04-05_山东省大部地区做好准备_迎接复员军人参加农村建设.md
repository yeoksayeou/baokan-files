Most Areas of Shandong Province Prepare to Welcome Demobilized Soldiers to Participate in Rural Construction
	The Guanyemiao Agricultural Cooperative in Linqu County has already reserved the position of bookkeeper for Wei Chunhe, who is about to be demobilized. Yao Dian Township in Ju County has prepared 28 public houses and some furniture such as tables, chairs, and beds for demobilized soldiers returning to their hometowns.
    (Reported by this newspaper) According to Shandong Dazhong Daily News: Most areas of Shandong Province have made preparations to receive and resettle demobilized soldiers who are about to return to their hometowns.
    During the preparation work, the Party and government leading organs in various places first inspected the work of preferential treatment and demobilization resettlement. During the inspection, it was found that some families of martyrs, military dependents, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers who lacked labor faced difficulties in their lives. Cadres then helped agricultural cooperatives to combine the formulation of production plans and contracted work with output, appropriately arranged labor, and implemented preferential labor-day methods, which initially solved their production and living difficulties. In Wudi, Chiping, Yangxin, and Shen Counties alone, 9,404 households were given 886,000 preferential labor days. Appropriate solutions were also provided for those currently facing difficulties in clothing and food. For those who had no houses, lacked houses, or whose houses were dilapidated and needed repair, the general approach was to prepare the materials themselves, with the cooperative providing labor assistance and the government providing appropriate subsidies when necessary. In areas with public housing, adjustments were made from the public housing stock. According to incomplete statistics from Yucheng, Wudi, and other eight counties, 166 public houses have been allocated, 1,076 houses have been built with labor from the cooperative, and the government has allocated more than 20,000 yuan for house repairs. For those who are ill, local medical treatment and other methods were also adopted for timely treatment. Wudi County also divided the county into nine districts, with health agencies responsible for the treatment of diseases of families of martyrs, military dependents, disabled soldiers, and demobilized soldiers in each district. This work has laid a favorable foundation for this year's resettlement of demobilized soldiers.
    While conducting inspections, some counties also sent people deep into townships and cooperatives to conduct special investigations into the family circumstances of demobilized soldiers who will be returning home this year, to understand the difficulties they may encounter in the future, so as to solve them in a planned way. Twenty-five counties, including Weixian, Pingdu, Liaocheng, and Gaotang, have strengthened and improved the organizations of the Transfer and Construction Committee. All counties, districts, and townships in the Liaocheng area have also established full-time personnel. Qixia County has also established a reception committee. In Jiaoxian County, 105 townships have established preferential treatment and demobilization committees, and cooperatives in 66 townships have established preferential treatment and demobilization reception teams. Twelve counties, including Pingyin, Wendeng, Yinan, Changyi, Weishan, and Gaotang, have completed this year's resettlement plan. Many agricultural cooperatives have also formulated resettlement plans based on the situation of the demobilized soldiers who will be returning home. The Guanyemiao Agricultural Cooperative in Gaogou Township, Linqu County, has already reserved the position of bookkeeper for Wei Chunhe, who is about to be demobilized. The Heping Agricultural Cooperative in Daxin Township, Licheng County, has also decided to strengthen education and mediation work for family disputes, striving to achieve family harmony. Yao Dian Township in Ju County has prepared 28 public houses and some furniture such as tables, chairs, and beds for demobilized soldiers returning to their hometowns. In order to ensure that demobilized soldiers have a comfortable life on their way home, many counties have convened meetings of responsible persons from grain and transportation departments to study issues such as grain supply and vehicle transportation, to ensure that demobilized soldiers return home comfortably and embark on the job of building a new socialist countryside happily.

    山东省大部地区做好准备
    迎接复员军人参加农村建设
    临朐县关爷庙农业社，已给即将复员的魏春和留下了记账员的职务。巨野县姚店乡已准备好公房二十八间和部分桌、椅、床等家具，留给即将回乡的复员军人使用。
    本报讯　据山东大众日报消息：山东省大部地区已做好接待和安置即将回乡的复员军人的准备工作。
    在准备工作期间，各地党政领导机关首先检查了优抚和复员安置工作。在检查中发现有些缺乏劳力的烈属、军属、残废军人、复员军人生活上有困难，干部们就帮助农业社结合制订生产计划和包工包产，适当地安排了劳动活路，并实行了优待劳动日的办法，初步解决了他们的生产和生活困难。仅无棣、茌平、阳信、莘县等四个县，就对九千四百零四户，优待了八十八万六千多个劳动日。对当前衣、食有困难的，也适当地予以解决。无房、缺房或房屋破漏需要修补的，一般地采取了自己备料，合作社出工协助，必要时政府予以适当补助的办法解决。有公房的地区则从公房中予以调剂。据禹城、无棣等八个县的不完全统计，已拨给公房一百六十六间，由社出工修建了一千零七十六间，政府拨出修房款二万余元。对有病的，也采取就地医疗等办法，及时予以治疗。无棣县还把全县划分为九片，卫生机关分片负责烈属、军属、残废军人和复员军人的疾病治疗。这些工作，为今年的安置复员军人打下了有利的基础。
    与检查的同时，有的县还派人深入乡、社，对今年即将回乡的复员军人的家庭情况，专门作了调查，了解他们将来可能遇到的困难，以便于有计划地解决。潍县、平度、聊城、高唐等二十五个县都充实和健全了转业建设委员会的机构，聊城专区各县、区、乡也都设立了专职人员。栖霞县还成立了接待委员会。胶县有一百零五个乡成立了优抚、复员委员会，六十六个乡的合作社建立了优抚、复员接待小组。平阴、文登、沂南、昌邑、微山、高唐等十二个县已做好了今年的安置计划。不少农业社也根据即将回乡的复员军人的情况，制订出了安置计划。临朐县高沟乡关爷庙农业社，已给即将复员的魏春和留下了记账员的职务。历城县大辛乡和平农业社，对家务有纠纷的，也决定加强教育和调解工作，争取达到全家和睦。巨野县姚店乡已准备好公房二十八间和部分桌、椅、床等家具，留给即将回乡的复员军人使用。为了让复员军人回家途中生活安适，不少县召开了粮食、交通等部门负责人会议，研究了粮食供应、车辆运输等问题，以保证复员军人安适地回到家里，愉快地走上建设社会主义新农村的工作岗位。
