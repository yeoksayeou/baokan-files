Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, April 11th: How to correctly resolve contradictions among the people in rural areas, run agricultural cooperatives well, and strive for a bumper harvest? The Third Rural Work Conference of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, which concluded on the 9th, conducted a comprehensive study of this issue and made important decisions.

The conference lasted for ten days. Participants included CCP Secretaries of prefectural committees, county committees, and heads of rural work departments from across the province. After studying Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference on "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," they analyzed the current contradictions among the people in rural areas of Heilongjiang Province.

The conference required that communist party organizations at all levels in the province pay special attention to overcoming subjectivism, bureaucratism, and sectarianism in the future, regularly pay attention to studying new situations and new contradictions that arise in rural areas, and adopt the principle of overall consideration to correctly adjust relations in all aspects. The conference proposed eight specific measures to adjust relations in all aspects economically and organizationally:

	I. In the planning system, conscientiously implement the principle of "maintaining the independence of agricultural cooperative management under the guidance of state planning;"
	II. Improve rural commercial work and correctly implement the state's price policy for the purchase of agricultural and sideline products;
	III. Resolutely implement the "three fix" policy for grain, and leave surplus grain for farmers according to the "three fix" standards;
	IV. Improve rural tax work and strictly prevent arbitrarily increasing tax rates or expanding tax items;
	V. Based on the principles of protecting resources, utilizing resources, benefiting the country, benefiting farmers, and also benefiting production, make overall plans for state-owned resources and use them rationally;
	VI. Cherish the people's labor and rationally use the obligatory labor of farmers for the country;
	VII. Appropriately arrange time for the sideline production of agricultural cooperatives and member families;
	VIII. Educate cadres to promptly understand and correctly handle the opinions and demands of the masses regarding leadership.

The conference also believed that continuously strengthening the education of peasants and cooperative cadres in socialism, collectivism, patriotism, and the worker-peasant alliance is an important method for smoothly resolving contradictions among the people in rural areas from a political and ideological perspective. Therefore, the conference required communist party organizations at all levels in rural areas to overcome the tendency to relax the party's political and ideological work in rural areas and to elevate political and ideological work to the primary position in the party's leadership work.

Regarding the issue of running agricultural cooperatives well, the conference believed that improving the democratic life of agricultural cooperatives is an important means of resolving internal contradictions in agricultural cooperatives, and therefore required all localities to conscientiously implement the policy of running cooperatives democratically. At the meeting, many people emphasized in discussions that improving the labor quota management system and correctly implementing the principle of distribution according to labor is an important link in correctly adjusting the contradictions between production teams, between members, and within the cooperative itself from an economic perspective. Some people also introduced their experiences and lessons in this regard. The conference also studied various technical production-increasing measures for striving for a bumper agricultural harvest. The conference determined that the province's planned total grain output this year should reach 18 billion catties, an increase of 8% over last year, and strive to exceed this target under normal weather conditions; the planned income from agricultural cooperative sideline production should reach about 40% of the total income from agricultural and sideline production, and under normal weather conditions, ensure that more than 85% of the cooperative members increase their income compared to last year.

The conference believes that running agricultural cooperatives well and striving for a bumper harvest mainly relies on the conscious initiative of farmers, and the key to determining the level of farmers' initiative largely depends on whether contradictions among the people are resolved in a timely and correct manner. Contradictions among the people in rural areas are mainly manifested in the relationship of interests between the state, agricultural cooperatives, and cooperative members, and within agricultural cooperatives, they are manifested in the relationship of interests between cooperatives and members, production teams and production teams, members and members, leaders and those being led, as well as in the struggle between socialist ideology and the remnants of capitalist ideology. The participants in the conference all agreed with what was pointed out in the report of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party: Since the realization of advanced agricultural cooperation throughout the province last spring, from a fundamental point of view, the relationship of interests between the state, agricultural cooperatives, and cooperative members has become closer and more consistent; the fact that the state and agricultural cooperatives have mutually supported each other on a larger scale in the past year, as well as the increasing income of the vast number of farmers and the continuous growth of collectivist ideology, all illustrate this point. However, contradictions are also frequently revealed in the relationship of interests among the three parties. In the relationship of interests between the state and agricultural cooperatives, contradictions mainly occur in the links of grain procurement, production planning arrangements, determination of prices for agricultural and sideline products, the financial burden of farmers on the state, the state's use of the people's labor, and farmers' use of state resources. For example, in grain procurement, some cooperatives have been unwilling to sell surplus grain, unwilling to sell good grain, or deliberately delayed paying public grain, and in individual places, there have been deviations where the grain purchase task exceeded the capacity of the cooperative; in the arrangement of production plans, there have been cases where the plans stipulated by the state were too rigid or the agricultural cooperatives did not plant according to the state plan; in addition, there have been cases where the prices of certain agricultural and sideline products were too low, and the state used too much of the people's labor, etc. In the relationship of interests between agricultural cooperatives and cooperative members, contradictions mainly occur in aspects such as the accumulation of the cooperative and the consumption of the members, collective production and household sideline production, and the collective needs and the individual daily life needs of the members. Many cooperatives have had the shortcomings of having either too much or too little public accumulation, too few distributions, and insufficient attention to the household sideline production and daily life needs of cooperative members. Many cooperatives have relatively commonly had or continue to have bad tendencies such as members neglecting labor quality, not cherishing or even damaging public property, and spoiling or stealing cooperative grain, etc., which damage the overall interests. Everyone analyzed the objective factors that caused the above-mentioned contradictions, and at the same time, emphatically criticized the subjective one-sidedness of the leadership work in the past.

    中共黑龙江省委农村工作会议作出决定
    正确地解决农村中人民内部的矛盾
    据新华社哈尔滨11日电　如何正确地解决农村中人民内部的矛盾，办好农业社，争取大丰收？9日结束的中共黑龙江省委员会第三次农村工作会议对这个问题作了全面研究，并且作出了重要的决定。
    这次会议开了十天。参加会议的有全省的中共地委书记、县委书记、农村工作部部长等。他们在学习毛主席在最高国务会议上关于
  “正确地处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲话以后，对黑龙江省当前农村中人民内部的矛盾作了分析。
    这次会议要求全省各级共产党组织今后特别注意克服主观主义、官僚主义和宗派主义，经常注意研究农村中出现的新情况和新矛盾，并且采取统筹兼顾的原则，正确地调整各方面的关系。会议提出从经济上、组织上调整各方面关系的八项具体措施是：
    一、在计划体制上，认真贯彻执行“在国家计划指导下保持农业社经营的独立性”的原则；
    二、改进农村商业工作，正确地执行国家关于收购农、副产品的价格政策；
    三、坚决执行粮食“三定”政策，按照“三定”标准给农民留余粮；
    四、改进农村税收工作，严格防止随便增加税率或扩大征税项目的做法；
    五、本着保护资源，利用资源，有利于国家，有利于农民，同时也有利于生产的原则，对国有资源通盘规划，合理使用；
    六、爱惜民力，合理使用农民对国家的义务劳动；
    七、适当安排农业社和社员家庭副业生产的时间；
    八、教育干部及时地了解和正确地处理群众对领导的意见和要求。
    会议还认为，不断地对农民和社干部加强社会主义、集体主义、爱国主义和工农联盟的教育，是从政治思想上顺利地解决农村中人民内部矛盾的重要方法。因此，会议要求农村中各级共产党组织克服放松党在农村的政治思想工作的偏向，把政治思想工作提到党的领导工作中的首要地位上来。
    关于办好农业社的问题，会议认为健全农业社的民主生活是解决农业社内部矛盾的重要手段，因而要求各地认真贯彻执行民主办社的方针。会上，许多人在讨论中强调指出，健全劳动定额管理制度，正确贯彻按劳分配的原则，是从经济上正确地调整社内生产队之间、社员之间的矛盾的重要环节。有些人还介绍了这方面的经验教训。对于争取农业大丰收的各种技术增产措施，会议也作了研究。会议确定今年全省计划粮食总产量达到一百八十亿斤，比去年增加8％，在正常年景下力争超过这个指标；计划农业社副业收入达到农、副业总收入的40％左右，在正常年景下做到85％以上的社员比去年增加收入。
    会议认为，办好农业社，争取大丰收，主要依靠农民的自觉的积极性，而决定农民积极性高低的关键，在颇大程度上取决于人民内部的矛盾是否得到及时、正确地解决。农村中人民内部的矛盾主要表现在国家、农业社和社员三方面的利益关系上，在农业社内部又表现在社和社员、生产队和生产队、社员和社员、领导和被领导之间的利益关系上，以及社会主义思想和资本主义残余思想的斗争中。参加会议的人们都同意中共黑龙江省委员会的报告中所指出的：从去年春天全省实现农业高级合作化以后，从根本上来说，国家、农业社和社员三方面的利益关系是更加密切和一致了；一年来国家和农业社在更大规模上相互支援以及广大农民收入增加、集体主义思想不断增长的事实，都说明了这一点。但是，在三方面的利益关系上也经常表露出矛盾。在国家和农业社的利益关系上，矛盾主要发生在粮食的征购、生产计划的安排、农、副产品价格的确定、农民对国家财政的负担、国家对民力的使用、农民对国家资源的利用等环节。例如在粮食征购上发生过有些合作社不肯卖余粮、不肯卖好粮或故意拖欠公粮的现象，个别地方也有购粮任务超过合作社能力的偏差；在生产计划的安排上，存在过国家规定的计划过死或农业社不按国家计划种植；此外，还发生过某些农副产品价格偏低、国家对民力使用过多等等。在农业社和社员的利益关系上，矛盾主要发生在社的积累和社员消费、集体生产和家庭副业生产、集体需要和社员个人的日常生活需要等方面。许多合作社曾经出现过公共积累或多或少、分配次数太少、对社员家庭副业生产和社员的日常生活需要照顾不够的缺点。许多合作社曾比较普遍地存在过或继续存在着社员忽视劳动质量、不爱护甚至损坏公共财产、糟蹋或盗窃合作社粮食等等损害整体利益的不良倾向。大家分析了产生上述各种矛盾的客观因素，同时着重地批判了过去领导工作中的主观片面性的缺点。
