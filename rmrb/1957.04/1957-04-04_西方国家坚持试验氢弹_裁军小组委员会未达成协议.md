Xinhua News Agency, London, 3rd: The United Nations Disarmament Committee Subcommittee concluded its preliminary discussions on the issue of nuclear explosion tests on April 2nd, without reaching any agreement on the matter.

It is revealed that the Soviet representative firmly advocated for the cessation of all atomic weapons tests during the discussions. However, the representatives of the United States and Great Britain insisted that hydrogen bomb tests must continue until an agreement is reached on the so-called "international control" issue.

The French representative proposed restricting nuclear explosion tests at the meeting, and the Canadian representative suggested prior registration of nuclear explosion tests with the United Nations. However, like the representatives of the United States and Great Britain, they opposed the immediate cessation of these tests. Due to the failure to reach an agreement on this issue, the meeting decided to temporarily set aside discussions on this matter.

The committee's meeting on the 3rd will begin discussing the issue of reducing conventional armaments.

    西方国家坚持试验氢弹
    裁军小组委员会未达成协议
    新华社3日讯　伦敦消息：联合国裁军委员会小组委员会4月2日结束了关于原子核爆炸试验问题的初步讨论，会议没有就这个问题达成任何协议。
    据透露，苏联代表在讨论中坚决主张停止一切原子武器的试验，但是，美英两国代表却坚持在就所谓“国际管制”问题达成协议以前，氢弹试验必须继续进行下去。
    法国代表在会上提出了限制原子核爆炸试验的主张，加拿大代表提出了在联合国事先登记原子核爆炸试验的建议，但是他们和美英两国代表一样，反对立即停止进行这些试验。由于在这个问题上没有能够达成协议，会议商定暂时把关于这个问题的讨论搁置起来。
    委员会3日会议将开始讨论裁减常规军备的问题。
