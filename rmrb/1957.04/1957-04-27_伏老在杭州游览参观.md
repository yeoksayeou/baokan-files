    Comrade Voroshilov refuses to admit he is old
    Comrade Voroshilov truly refuses to admit he is old,
    A general always admires a general.
    He defeated Hitler through hardship,
    And suppressed the White Army after many battles.
    Great generals of the past often had rich experience,
    And recognised poetic sentiment amidst war and mountains;
    The Hangzhou Governor is as if still here,
    Surely he would smile to welcome such a kindred spirit.
    This poem was written by Chen Guangcai, a resident of the Workers' Sanatorium on Pingfeng Mountain in Hangzhou, to welcome Comrade Voroshilov. He is the deputy secretary of the Party branch of the Shanghai Postal and Telecommunications Supply Office.

    Yesterday morning, when Comrade Voroshilov, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai and others, visited the Workers' Sanatorium, Premier Zhou noticed this seven-character poem in front of the blackboard newspaper. He immediately asked the translator to read it to Comrade Voroshilov. After the translator read the poem entitled "Joyfully Meeting Comrade Voroshilov in Hangzhou" to him, he happily took the hands of Comrades He Long and Peng Zhen and asked them to admire the poem as well.

    Premier Zhou also introduced the author of the poem to Comrade Voroshilov. Chen Guangcai was originally a postman at the Shanghai Post Office, and has now been cultivated by the Party into a deputy secretary of a branch. He is staying at the sanatorium because of neurasthenia. This sanatorium was originally the villa of Kong Xiangxi, one of the four major families of the Kuomintang. Today, it has become a resort for Shanghai workers to rest and recuperate.

    After Comrade Voroshilov visited this quiet sanatorium, he addressed all the sanatorium patients and staff who welcomed him. He said that it was truly a blessing that China, only seven years after liberation, could have such beautiful and comfortable sanatoriums for workers. He hoped that in the near future, all Chinese working people would have the same opportunity for rest and recuperation. Then, Comrade Voroshilov pointed to Premier Zhou, Comrade He Long, and Comrade Peng Zhen sitting in a row with him and said to the sanatorium patients and staff, the Chinese national leaders Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Zhu De, and Chairman Liu Shaoqi, as well as all those present, are working hard for your happiness, you are the happiest people.

    Comrade Voroshilov also said: Now, you are building, and we are also building. Let us unite as closely as blood brothers and provide an example to the people of the world, telling them of a better life. At the same time, we should not forget those Eastern nations who are in dire straits. If we unite with them, our strength will be invincible.

    Pre-Qingming Dragon Well Tea Presented to Honored Guests
    Before visiting the Pingfeng Mountain Workers' Sanatorium, Comrade Voroshilov and his entourage, accompanied by Premier Zhou and others, also visited the Meijiawu October Tea Production Cooperative. Director Du Guanshun and Deputy Director Lu Zhenhao, on behalf of all 1,053 members of the cooperative, presented three catties of pre-Qingming Dragon Well tea to the honored Soviet guests. It is said that this type of tea is the most precious and top-grade tea. This year, they only harvested twelve catties of pre-Qingming tea from the cooperative's 650 mu of tea gardens. This high-grade Dragon Well tea is picked when the first bud sprouts on the tea tree two or three days before Qingming, so it is especially fragrant and delicious.

    The production of this cooperative has been helped and guided by Soviet experts. To commemorate Sino-Soviet friendship and the October Revolution, this cooperative was named the "October" Tea Cooperative. It is now one of the best cooperatives among tea farmers in the suburbs of Hangzhou.

    Comrade Voroshilov was very concerned about the income of the tea farmers. He heard that the members of this cooperative earned an average of 640 yuan per household last year, and asked the deputy director who was introducing the situation to him how much individual farmers earned per household before joining the cooperative. Although Comrade Lu Zhenhao did not immediately give a specific figure, he told Comrade Voroshilov that in the past, everyone relied on chopping firewood for a living, and tea simply could not be sold. Comrade Voroshilov was a little surprised to hear this. He insisted on asking about the income of tea farmers in the past. Lu calculated that before they were organized, a family could earn at most 150 yuan. Then Comrade Lu Zhenhao told Comrade Voroshilov a story about their hard lives before liberation: one family prepared 100 yuan to marry a daughter-in-law, but they could only buy a thin robe material. He said that in the past, one catty of tea could only be exchanged for one catty of corn flour, but now one catty of tea can be exchanged for twenty catties of rice. Premier Zhou added that in the past, merchants monopolized the market and lowered the price of tea, so one catty of tea could only be exchanged for one catty of coarse grain. Now the state purchases tea and raises the price, so one catty can be exchanged for more than twenty catties of fine grain, a big difference.

    At this time, people realized the root cause of Comrade Voroshilov's questioning. He said to the deputy director standing in front of him that farmers should understand their lives and compare their lives now and in the past. Otherwise, some people will have this requirement today and that requirement tomorrow, and he will be dissatisfied. Then he encouraged them to continue to improve and to help the nearby cooperatives, and not to be complacent. Premier Zhou also instructed the director not to be proud and to humbly learn from others.

    Later, Comrade Voroshilov asked Lu Zhenhao if he was a Party member. He answered yes. He also asked how many Party members there were in the whole cooperative. He replied that there were nineteen. Comrade Voroshilov said that there were not many Party members, but then he quoted Lenin's famous saying "Better fewer, but better," encouraging Party members to play an exemplary role, help non-Party masses, and do a good job in the relationship between the Party and non-Party members, he said because Party members are a minority and the masses are the majority. Finally, he raised a cup of newly brewed Dragon Well tea, clinked glasses with the director and deputy director, and earnestly instructed them not to be arrogant, and asked them to send his regards to all the cooperative members.

    When Comrade Voroshilov first arrived at this cooperative, he entered the auditorium and learned that it was the landlord's house before land reform. He asked where the landlord had gone. Premier Zhou told him that he had moved to a smaller house, and the deputy director added that the landlord had joined the cooperative after changing his class status. When Comrade Voroshilov heard that the landlord had become a farmer and the capitalist had become a worker, he immediately told the Soviet journalists who came with him to record it and report it. He also wanted to find a landlord who had changed his class status and shake hands with him. Later, in the tea garden, he met a tea-picking girl named Sun Xueying, whose grandfather was a landlord and whose father is now a technician in the tea factory. Comrade Voroshilov not only took a photo with this young girl, but also shook hands with her.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, April 26th: Hangzhou Mayor Wu Xian hosted a dinner banquet for Chairman Voroshilov tonight at the Louwailou Restaurant on the shore of West Lake. Premier Zhou Enlai also attended as a guest.

    After the banquet, Chairman Voroshilov, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai, watched the Shanghai Yue Opera Troupe perform the mythological drama "Chasing the Fish" at the People's Hall. (Attached image)

    伏老在杭州游览参观
    本报记者　刘时平
    伏老不服老
    伏老可真不服老，
    将军总是爱将军。
    艰辛击溃希特勒，
    辗转扫荡白卫军。
    自古名将多丰韵，
    戎马关山识诗情；
    杭州刺史今如在，
    料当含笑接知音。
    这首诗是一位住在杭州屏风山工人疗养院的陈广才为欢迎伏老写的。他是上海邮电供应处党支部的副书记。
    昨天上午，当伏老由周恩来总理等陪同去参观工人疗养院时，周总理走过黑板报前，首先发现这首七言诗，随请翻译同志给伏老朗诵。当翻译同志把这首题为“在杭喜逢伏老”的诗句念给他听以后，他高兴地拉着贺龙同志和彭真同志的手，让他们也来欣赏这首诗。
    周总理还把这位写诗的作者介绍给伏老。陈广才原来是上海邮局的邮递员，现在已被党培养成一位支部副书记。他因为神经衰弱住在疗养院。这座疗养院原来是国民党四大家族之一孔祥熙的别墅。今天变成了上海工人的休养胜地了。
    伏老参观了这个幽静的疗养院以后，对欢迎他的全体疗养员和职工讲了话。他认为我国在解放后只有七年，职工就可以有这样美丽舒适的疗养院，真是幸福。他希望在不久之后，所有的中国劳动人民都能得到同样的休养的机会。然后，伏老指着和他坐在一排的周总理、贺龙同志和彭真同志对休养员和职工们说，中国的国家领袖毛主席、朱德副主席和刘少奇委员长以及在座的诸位都在为你们的幸福而努力工作着，你们是最幸福的人。
    伏老又说：现在，你们在建设，我们也在建设，让我们像亲兄弟一般亲密地团结在一起，给全世界人民提出一个范例，告诉他们更美好的生活。同时，我们也不应该忘记那些处在水深火热中的东方民族，我们和他们联合起来，我们的力量是无敌的。
      明前龙井赠贵宾
    在到屏风山工人疗养院参观以前，伏老和随行的客人，在周总理等陪同下，还参观了梅家坞十月茶叶生产合作社。社长杜官顺和副社长卢镇豪代表全社一千零五十三个社员赠给苏联贵宾们三斤明前龙井茶叶。据说这种茶叶是最名贵的特级茶。他们在全社六百五十亩茶园中，今年只采了明前茶十二斤。这种高级的龙井茶是在清明前二、三天茶树上发出第一芽时就摘下来的，所以特别清香可口。
    这个社的生产，曾经受过苏联专家的帮助和指导。为了纪念中苏友谊和十月革命，这个合作社定名为“十月”茶叶合作社。现在是杭州近郊茶农中最好的一个社。
    伏老很关心茶农的收入。他听说这个社的社员去年每家平均收入六百四十元，又问给他介绍情况的副社长说，在没入社前，个体农民每家收入多少。卢镇豪同志虽然没有立时答出一个具体数字，但他告诉伏老，在以前大家都靠砍柴为生，茶叶根本卖不出去。伏老听了有点惊奇。一定要追问过去茶农的收入。卢算了一遍，在没组织起来以前，一家人最多也不过收入一百五十元。然后卢镇豪同志给伏老讲了一个他们在解放前辛酸生活的故事：有一家人准备了一百元钱，要给儿子娶媳妇，结果只买了一件薄薄的袍料。他说，过去一斤茶只换一斤苞米粉，现在一斤茶可换二十斤大米。周总理接着补充说，过去商人垄断，把茶价压低，所以一斤茶只能换一斤粗粮，现在国家收购，茶价提高，一斤可换二十多斤细粮，相差很大。
    在这时候，人们才知道伏老要追问的根由。他向站在他对面的副社长说，要让农民了解他们的生活，比较他们今昔的生活。要不然，就会有人今天有这样的要求，明天又有那样的要求，他会不满足的。然后他又勉励他们，要不断改善，并要帮助附近的社，不要自满。周总理也嘱咐社长，不要骄傲，要向别人虚心学习。
    后来伏老问卢镇豪是不是党员。他回答是。又问全社有多少党员。他回答说有十九个。伏老说党员不多，但又接着引证列宁说过的“宁缺毋滥”的名言，鼓励党员要起模范作用，帮助非党群众，搞好党和非党的关系，他说因为党员是少数，群众是多数。最后他端起一杯刚刚泡好的新龙井茶，向社长和副社长碰杯，并谆谆嘱咐他们不要骄傲，并请他们代问全体社员好。
    伏老在刚到这个社时，一进大礼堂知道了那是土地改革以前地主的房子，他就问地主跑到哪儿去了。周总理告诉他已换了小房子，副社长接着告诉他，地主改变成分以后已参加了合作社。伏老听说地主变成农民，资本家变成工人，马上告诉随同他来的苏联记者，要他们记录下来，报道出去。他并且要找一个已经改变了成分的地主和他握一握手。后来到茶园中，碰到一个采茶姑娘孙雪英，她的祖父就是地主，他的父亲现在做了茶厂的技术员。伏老不但和这位年轻的姑娘照了相，而且同她握了手。
    新华社杭州26日电　杭州市市长吴宪今晚在西湖湖滨的楼外楼饭店举行便宴招待伏罗希洛夫主席。周恩来总理也出席作陪。
    宴会后，伏罗希洛夫主席由周恩来总理陪同，在人民大会堂观看了上海越剧院演出的神话剧“追鱼”。（附图片）
