Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 23rd: Chairman Voroshilov, accompanied by Chairman Liu Shaoqi, visited the Shenxin No. 9 Cotton Textile Factory, the largest joint state-private cotton textile factory in China with a sixty-year history, this morning.

    Rong Yiren, General Manager of the Shenxin Cotton Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory, greeted the distinguished guests at the entrance.

    When Chairman Voroshilov visited the workshop, he constantly shook hands and chatted with the female workers. Wu Zhongyi, the private factory director, and the public representative, who accompanied the visit, answered Chairman Voroshilov's questions about the factory and its production during the tour.

    After visiting the workshop, Chairman Voroshilov, Rong Yiren, Wu Zhongyi, and others held talks in the reception room.

    At Chairman Voroshilov's suggestion, Rashidov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Uzbek Republic, invited the Shenxin No. 9 Factory to establish contact with a textile factory named after Stalin in Tashkent, the capital of the Uzbek Republic, which has more than 20,000 workers, to strengthen the unity of workers in both countries.

    Before leaving, Chairman Voroshilov happily said that this was a very good factory, and the leaders and workers had newly learned how to manage the factory. People should not think that the people in this factory are only spinning and weaving; the achievements gained by all mankind in collective labor will make all attempts by warmongers to launch wars impossible to realize.

    Wu Zhongyi, on behalf of the entire factory, presented Chairman Voroshilov with cotton undershirts, singlets, and high-quality poplin made from cotton yarn produced by their own factory.

    Chairman Voroshilov and others then took a car to visit the Sino-Soviet Friendship Building in the city center.

    苏联贵宾参观上海申新九厂
    据新华社上海23日电　伏罗希洛夫主席今天上午由刘少奇委员长陪同参观了有六十年历史的中国最大的公私合营棉纺织厂——申新第九棉纺织厂。
    申新棉纺织印染厂总管理处总经理荣毅仁在门前迎候贵宾。
    伏罗希洛夫主席到车间参观时，不断地和女工们握手谈笑。陪同参观的私方厂长吴中一和公方代表在参观过程中回答了伏罗希洛夫主席关于工厂和生产情况的询问。
    参观车间回来，伏罗希洛夫主席和荣毅仁、吴中一等在会客室里进行了谈话。
    在伏罗希洛夫主席的建议下，乌兹别克共和国最高苏维埃主席团主席拉希多夫邀请申新九厂和乌兹别克共和国首都塔什干的一个以斯大林命名的有两万多工人的纺织工厂建立联系，加强两国工人的团结。
    临行前，伏罗希洛夫主席高兴地说，这是一个很好的工厂，领导人员和工人们新学会了如何管理工厂。不要以为这个工厂的人们是在纺纱织布，全人类在集体的劳动中获得的成就，会使战争贩子发动战争的一切企图不能实现。
    吴中一代表全厂把用自己工厂生产的棉纱织成的棉毛衫、汗背心和高级府绸赠送给伏罗希洛夫主席。
    伏罗希洛夫主席等又乘车到市中心的中苏友好大厦参观。
