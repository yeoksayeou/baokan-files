    Why are we running "Zhengming"?
    Qian Jiaju
    The "Zhengming" monthly magazine was founded in October last year in response to the call of the Party and Chairman Mao for "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend." Initially, it was only distributed within the China Democratic League. Now, to expand its readership, it has been decided to make it publicly available starting from April this year.
    Some people ask: Why do you want to run this publication? Aren't there enough types of publications in our country? In terms of academic research, there are various "×× Studies" and university journals. For young people, there is "China Youth." For women, there is "Chinese Women." For guiding cadres' studies, there is the "Study" bi-monthly. For comprehensive academic magazines, there is "New Construction," etc. Even "Chess" and "Philately" have specialized publications. What kind of nature does your "Zhengming" belong to? Who are your target readers?
    Indeed, "Zhengming" does not belong to any of the above categories. The reason we want to run "Zhengming" is very simple: to give our academic and ideological circles one more field for "contention." Since the Party put forward the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" last year, it cannot be said that our ideological circles have been completely free of worries, "blooming" and "contending" as much as possible, especially before half a year ago. To "contend," it is necessary to dispel their ideological concerns and provide them with a field for "contending." General publications always have their own style and serve a certain target audience, and at the same time, they are responsible for the mission of propaganda and education for this group of readers. Some articles are not suitable for publication. In recent years, the situation in which senior intellectuals have things they dare not say, write articles they dare not take out, and even if they do, there is nowhere to publish them, cannot be said to be an isolated case. The "Zhengming" monthly magazine, as its name suggests, is to encourage everyone to contend. It is a comprehensive monthly magazine dedicated to serving the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend." The content includes philosophy, history, economics, politics and law, education, literature and art, and natural sciences. As long as it is based on evidence and reasoned, you can come and contend. We do not require that the views and positions of every article be correct. Our purpose is only to promote a atmosphere of free debate, to revitalize the academic and ideological circles. Even if it is weeds and wildflowers, we welcome them to bloom here, and perhaps fragrant flowers can be released from them. In the past few issues, we have been working according to this policy. Even during the trial period, although it was not publicly distributed, many articles inside have already attracted attention from all parties, and many people have asked us for copies. For example, we have published articles on realism, traditional Chinese painting, aesthetics, the relationship between productive forces and relations of production, and whether there are contradictions between scientific research and teaching work. For example, in the February issue, we published Comrade Hu Dunyuan's article "The Post-War American Economic Crisis." Whether the views in this article are correct is highly debatable, but he cited many materials and put forward his own views on the American economic crisis. He basically opposed regarding the decline in American production in 1946 and 1948 as an economic crisis, and put forward a more optimistic estimate of the future of the American economy. An article like this would not necessarily have the opportunity to be published in general publications. This article has also attracted the attention of researchers of international economic issues in our country, who believe it is a question worth contending. In addition, we have also used the organization of the China Democratic League to organize symposiums in a planned way, inviting people from higher education and cultural circles to discuss some important cultural and educational issues. After Chairman Mao made a speech on the issue of handling contradictions among the people at the Supreme State Conference, we invited a group of social scientists to discuss how to carry out academic contention. The participants included Shen Zhiyuan, Wu Jingchao, Chen Da, Deng Chumin, Peng Dixian, Pan Guangdan, Sun Yutang, Yue Zhaiheng, Fan Puzhai and more than ten other comrades. Among them, there were sharply opposed opinions (the symposium record has been published in the April issue of "Zhengming"). For example, on the issue of the scientific system, we also invited a group of scientists to hold a symposium. The participants included Qian Xuesen, Qian Weichang, Zeng Zhaolun, Tong Dizhou, Zhang Jingyue, Li Zongen, Chu Shenglin, Ma Dayou, Chen Shihua, Zhang Wei, Qian Duansheng, Jian Bozan, Wu Jingchao, Fei Xiaotong, and Sun Qu, to discuss the relationship between central and local scientific research institutions, between the Academy of Sciences and universities, and between the Academy of Sciences and the scientific research institutions led by various business departments of the central government, as well as the proportion of natural science and social science research institutes (the symposium record is published in full in the May issue of "Zhengming"). Their opinions are consistent, and inconsistent, that is to say, some of them must be correct, and some are partly incorrect. Our purpose is to arouse everyone's contention, and to draw relatively correct conclusions from the contention. We want to use this method to initiate everyone's discussion on the current major scientific and cultural policies. After that, we plan to continue to hold symposiums on cultural and educational measures, academic ideas, etc. According to our experience in these two symposiums, friends in the scientific and higher education circles do have opinions on the national cultural and educational measures, and they are also willing to express them, but it cannot be said that they have expressed them without reservation. This will naturally take a process. Symposiums like these may be more open and freer than those convened by the government. This will be helpful for the Party to formulate policies and consider issues.
    In addition, we have another small purpose in running this publication, that is, to promote a new writing style: short, concise, to the point, realistic, and less nonsense. In our call for contributions, we require that the length of submissions generally does not exceed 3,000 words (although we have not yet reached this requirement). We believe that if an author is willing to be responsible for the reader's time, has clear ideas and themes, and writes concisely, he can generally explain a problem in three or four thousand words. Of course, certain academic discussions cannot be limited to three or four thousand words. The "Zhengming" monthly magazine is neither a specialized academic journal, nor a political commentary publication. It neither wants to guide thought, nor does it hope to become a forum for political essays. But it hopes to revitalize the atmosphere of the academic circles through "contention," and to gradually improve the Marxist-Leninist level of our intellectuals through "contention." Secondly, we also want to promote a simple style. Some people say that our cover is too "shabby." Indeed, we intentionally made it so "shabby." Aren't there enough publications printed on glossy paper with color illustrations in the publishing industry today? What's wrong with being simpler and more generous!
    The above is a simple explanation of our motivation for running "Zhengming." Of course, in the past few issues, we had too many shortcomings, the quality of the articles was not high, and there were many typos in proofreading. This is because the first few issues were still in the trial stage, there was not much experience, and the sources of manuscripts were not abundant. Since it has not been publicly sold, the general readers do not know that there is such a publication. Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to explain the purpose of our running "Zhengming," and hope that readers across the country will support us, and that intellectuals across the country will contend. Our field is open. We welcome both orchids and fragrant grass. Even weeds and wildflowers can bloom here. Our editorial department only holds on to one line, and that line is the people's democratic dictatorship system, which is socialism.

### 我们为什么要办“争鸣”？

    我们为什么要办“争鸣”？
    千家驹
    “争鸣”月刊是为响应党和毛主席“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的号召，在去年10月创办的，当初只在中国民主同盟内部发行，现在为了扩大读者影响，决定自今年4月份起公开发行了。
    有人问：你们为什么要办这一个刊物呢？我国刊物的种类还不够多吗？学术研究方面有各种“××研究”和大学学报，给青年们看的有“中国青年”，给妇女们看的有“中国妇女”，辅导干部学习的有“学习”半月刊，综合性的学术杂志有“新建设”等等，甚至“象棋”，“集邮”都有专门性刊物，你们的“争鸣”究竟是属于哪一类性质的呢？读者的对象是些什么人呢？
    的确，“争鸣”是不属于上述性质中任何一类的。我们所以要办“争鸣”，理由很简单，就是要让我们的学术界思想界多一“争鸣”的园地。自去年党提出了“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针以后，我国思想界还不能说已经毫无顾虑，尽量地“放”，尽情地“鸣”起来了，在半年以前，尤其如此。要“鸣”，必须解除他们的思想顾虑，供给他们以“鸣”的园地。一般的刊物总有它一定的风格，为一定的读者对象服务，同时也就负有对这一部分读者宣传教育的使命。有些文章，它们是不适宜于刊登的。这几年来，高级知识分子中有话不敢说，写成文章不敢往外拿，即令拿了出来也没有地方发表的情况还不能说是个别的。“争鸣”月刊，顾名思义，就是要鼓励大家来争鸣，它是一种综合性月刊，专为“百花齐放、百家争鸣”方针服务，内容包括哲学、史学、经济、政法、教育、文艺、自然科学各个方面，只要持之有故，言之成理，就可以来争鸣一番。我们不要求每篇文章的观点、立场都正确，我们的目的只在提倡一种自由争辩的风气，使学术界思想界活跃起来，即使野草闲花，我们也欢迎到这儿来放一放，里面也许可以放出香花来。过去几期，我们就是本着这种方针办事的。即使在试办时期，虽未公开发行，里面许多文章已经引起了各方面的重视，向我们索阅的很多。例如我们曾经发表了关于现实主义、国画、美学、生产力和生产关系以及科学研究和教学工作是不是有矛盾等问题的争鸣文章。又如2月号我们发表了胡敦元同志“战后美国经济危机问题”一文，这篇文章的观点是否正确是大可讨论的，但是他列举许多材料，提出他自己对美国经济危机的看法，他基本上反对把1946年和1948年美国生产减退视为经济危机的看法，并对今后美国经济提出比较乐观的估计。像这样一篇文章，在一般刊物上就不见得有机会发表。这篇文章也已经引起了我国研究国际经济问题者的注意，认为是一个值得争鸣的问题。此外，我们还通过了民盟的组织，利用了座谈会的方式，有计划地组织高教文化界对当前一些重要的文教问题进行座谈。当毛主席在最高国务会议上作了关于处理人民内部矛盾问题的讲话以后，我们约集了一部分社会科学家座谈如何展开学术界的争鸣问题，参加的有沈志远、吴景超、陈达、邓初民、彭迪先、潘光旦、孙毓棠、岳齋恒、范朴斋等十多位同志，他们之中就有针锋相对的不同意见（座谈记录已发表在4月号“争鸣”上）。又如关于科学体制问题，我们也邀请了一部分科学家举行座谈，参加的有钱学森、钱伟长、曾昭抡、童第周、张景钺、李宗恩、褚圣麟、马大猷、陈士骅、张维、钱端升、翦伯赞、吴景超、费孝通、孙渠诸同志，讨论了中央和地方科学研究机构之间、科学院与高等学校之间、科学院与中央各业务部门所领导的科学研究机关之间的关系以及自然科学与社会科学研究所占比重等问题（座谈记录在“争鸣”5月号中全文发表）。他们的意见有一致的，也有不一致的，也就是说，其中一定有正确的，也有部分不正确的。我们的目的就是要引起大家的争鸣，由争鸣中得出比较正确的结论来。我们想通过这种方式来引发大家对当前重大的科学文化政策的讨论。此后我们并拟继续举行关于文教措施、学术思想等方面的座谈。据我们这两次座谈的经验，科学界高教界朋友对国家文教措施不是没有意见的，而且也愿意说出来，但还不能说已经毫无保留地说出来了。这自然还要经过一个过程。像这样一些座谈会，比之于由政府来召开也许要敞开一些，自由一些。这对于党的制定政策，考虑问题是会有帮助的。
    此外，我们办这个刊物还有一个小小的目的，那就是想提倡一种新的文风：短小精悍，开门见山，实事求是，少说废话。我们在征稿简约中要求来稿文长一般不超过三千字（虽然目前我们还未达到这要求）。我们认为，一个作者如果肯对读者的时间负责，有明确的思想和主题，文字写得简练些，有三、四千字一般是可以说明一个问题的。自然，对某些学术讨论是不能限于三、四千字的。“争鸣”月刊既不是一个专门学术性的学报，同时也不是一个政论刊物，它既不想指导思想，也不希望变成政治论文的讲坛。但希望通过“争鸣”，活跃学术界的空气，并且通过“争鸣”，逐步地提高我们知识分子的马克思列宁主义水平。其次我们还想提倡一个素朴的作风，有人说，我们的封面太“寒怆”。不错，我们是有意这样“寒怆”的。难道目前出版界用道林纸印套色画的刊物还不够多吗？素朴一些，大方一些，又有什么不好呢！
    以上是我们办“争鸣”的一点简单的动机。自然，过去几期我们的缺点是太多了，文章质量既不高，校对错字又多。这是由于最初几期还在试办阶段，经验不多，稿源不丰。既未公开发售，一般读者还不知道有这么一个刊物，因此，我借此机会把我们办“争鸣”的目的说明一下，并且希望全国读者来支持，全国知识分子来争鸣。我们的园地是公开的，芝兰芳草，我们固然欢迎，即使是野草闲花，也可以到我们这里来放一放，我们编辑部只守住一条线，这条线就是人民民主专政制度，就是社会主义。
