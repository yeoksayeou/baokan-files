Comrade Voroshilov's Visit to Shenyang

Our reporters Liu Shiping and Wen Tianshen

During Chairman Voroshilov's two-day visit to Shenyang, accompanied by Vice Chairman Zhu De and others, he toured the Shenyang First Machine Tool Plant, the Cable Factory, and the Northeast Industrial Exhibition Hall. He was warmly welcomed by the staff and workers at each location. The workers presented Comrade Voroshilov with their carefully crafted new products and exquisite models as permanent keepsakes.

As Strong as a Worker-Marshal

When he visited the First Machine Tool Plant, his primary concern was the workers' health and the "civilized production" of the entire factory. Drawing on his experience as a former worker, he mentioned that slight negligence in the factory, like carelessly discarding things, could turn useful items into waste and affect the workers' health, transforming the factory into a dilapidated shed instead of a proper factory. "This cannot be blamed on the workers," he emphasized. "There are no bad workers, only bad administrative leaders."

After visiting the 1A62 workshop in the First Machine Tool Plant, Director Wang Houshan and Party Secretary Li Yitang personally presented Comrade Voroshilov with an electric model of the 1A62 machine tool, measuring one and a half meters long and weighing fifteen kilograms, on behalf of all the workers. Upon receiving it, Comrade Voroshilov expressed his gratitude to all the workers on the spot and said with emotion:

"We are proud of you. Your achievements are our achievements, and our achievements are also your achievements. I believe that the Chinese working class will catch up with the most advanced ranks in the world in the near future." He concluded by shouting, "Long live the working class!"

Vice Premier He Long introduced Comrade Voroshilov to Wang Wenshan, the workshop director of this workshop, who was a leader cultivated from among the workers and a famous national model worker. Vice Premier He Long humorously said to Comrade Voroshilov, "He is stronger than our marshals. Our marshals are outdated." Comrade Voroshilov laughed heartily while holding Comrade He Long's hand, standing close to Vice Chairman Zhu, and saying to everyone, "It is also not possible to do without marshals like us."

Comrade Voroshilov's Boundless Concern for Workers

When Comrade Voroshilov went from the First Machine Tool Plant to the Northeast Industrial Exhibition Hall, he showed great interest in China's heavy industry development since the start of the first Five-Year Plan, from ore dressing to metallurgy, from power generation to locomotive and automobile manufacturing. He repeatedly declined requests to rest. He refused to take the elevator for the six floors, walking the entire way. After seeing the exhibits, even though it was noon, he was still in high spirits and proposed to visit two more factories.

His concern for the workers' lives was evident everywhere. While viewing the model of Northeast artificial petroleum at the exhibition hall, he noticed that a young female guide was very knowledgeable about the production process. Learning that she was originally a female worker but unfortunately did not have the opportunity for further education, he immediately asked the curator to help the female worker study and cultivate her into an excellent engineer.

When Comrade Voroshilov visited the model of the Harbin Linen Factory at the exhibition hall, upon hearing the guide's introduction that it was a new type of factory built with Soviet assistance during China's first Five-Year Plan, he smiled broadly, patted Comrade He Long's shoulder, and shook his head. Comrade He Long understood that he was being modest and told him, "This was aided by the Soviet Union."

It was already past noon, but Comrade Voroshilov still insisted on going to the highest floor of the exhibition hall to overlook the entire industrial base of Shenyang.

The Debate About Smoking

During a break, Xu Zhixiang, the curator of the exhibition hall, offered cigarettes to the distinguished guests. Curator Xu also said with a smile to Comrade Voroshilov, "I read in the newspaper that you spoke out against smoking when you visited the agricultural exhibition in Beijing, so I will not offer you one. I wish you longevity!" Comrade Voroshilov nodded and smiled, and humorously advised Comrade He Long to quit smoking. Because they had different views, an interesting debate arose. Comrade He Long used three reasons – "it can develop production, increase national income, and invigorate the spirit" – to illustrate the benefits of smoking.

The debate caused everyone to burst into laughter, believing it was a debate that would be difficult to conclude. However, the cigar that Comrade He Long often held in his mouth was rarely smoked from the afternoon onwards.

Distinguished Guests Encourage More Production

In the afternoon, the distinguished guests visited another cable factory, which had just been formally put into production last year with Soviet assistance. Comrade Voroshilov was pleased to see that various types of cables were already being produced in large quantities here. He had cordial conversations with many workers in the workshop and repeatedly urged the Soviet experts at the factory to help the Chinese workers master the new technologies. He said to the workers who warmly welcomed him, "We love peace and the happiness of our children, but the imperialists are constantly plotting to invade us. Therefore, we must produce more high-voltage cables to meet the needs of national defense and industry, and guarantee the defeat of any imperialist aggression."

After Comrade Voroshilov finished visiting the factory, he repeatedly told the workers that he hoped to convey his greetings to the workers of Shenyang and all citizens through them. Although he had left here, his heart remained here.

On the way back, the roadsides were packed with people, all wanting to catch a glimpse of Comrade Voroshilov's demeanor.

    伏老在沈阳参观记
    本报记者　刘时平　文天申
    伏罗希洛夫主席在来沈阳的这两天，由朱德副主席等陪同，参观了沈阳第一机床厂、电缆厂和东北工业陈列馆。受到各处职工的热烈欢迎。职工把自己精心制作的新产品、精致的模型送给伏老，作为永久的留念。
    工人元帅一样强
    当他参观第一机床厂的时候，首先关心的是工人的健康和全工厂的“文明生产”。他以曾做过工人的心情，谈到工厂里稍微不注意，乱扔东西，就会把有用的东西变成垃圾，同时会影响工人的健康，使工厂不成工厂，变成一个破草棚。“这不能怪工人”，他加重语气说：“没有不好的工人，只有不好的行政领导。”
    在第一机床厂参观完1A62车间后，厂长王侯山和党委书记李义堂亲自捧着一个长一公尺半、重十五公斤的1A62工作母机的电动模型，代表全体工人送给伏老。伏老接受后，当场对全体工人表示感谢，并激动地说：
  “我们为你们骄傲。你们的成就就是我们的成就，我们的成就也就是你们的成就。相信中国工人阶级在不久之后，一定会赶上全世界最先进的行列。”他最后高呼：“工人阶级万岁！”
    贺龙副总理给伏老介绍了这个车间的车间主任王文山，他是由工人培养起来的领导人员，有名的全国劳动模范。贺龙副总理有趣地向伏老说：“他比我们元帅强，我们元帅落伍了。”伏老拉着贺龙同志的手，哈哈大笑，和朱副主席紧靠在一起，并向大家说：“没有像我们这样的元帅也不行。”
    伏老无限关怀工人
    伏老从第一机床厂到东北工业陈列馆时，从选矿到冶金，从发电到火车头、汽车制造，看到中国在第一个五年计划开始后发展起来的重工业，兴趣十分浓厚，几次请他休息，他都不肯，上下六层楼梯，他拒不坐电梯，一直步行。在看完陈列品后，已到中午，他还兴致勃勃，提出要再参观两个工厂。
    他对工人生活的关心到处表现出来。在陈列馆观看东北人造石油时，看到一个年青的女讲解员对生产很熟悉，知道她原来是个女工，可惜没有深造的机会，他马上请馆长帮助这位女工读书，把她培养成为一个很好的工程师。
    伏老在陈列馆参观哈尔滨亚麻厂的模型时，听讲解员介绍说是我国第一个五年计划中，在苏联帮助下建成的一个新型的工厂，他满面笑容地拍着贺龙同志的肩膀，直摇头摆手。贺龙同志理解了他的意思是客气，就告诉他说：“这是苏联帮助的。”
    时已过午，伏老还坚持着走上陈列馆最高的楼顶上，俯瞰沈阳这个工业基地的全貌。
    关于抽烟的争论
    在休息时，陈列馆馆长徐志祥向贵宾们敬烟，徐馆长并且含笑对伏老说：“我从报纸上看到您在北京参观农业展览会时说过反对抽烟，所以我不敬您。祝您长寿！”伏老点头笑了，并且幽默地劝贺龙同志戒烟。由于他们二人看法不同，引起了一场有趣的争论。贺龙同志以“既能发展生产，又可增加国家收入，还能兴奋精神”三点理由来说明抽烟的好处。
    这场争论引得人们哄堂大笑，认为这是一场很难有结论的争论。可是，贺龙同志时常含在嘴上的一枝雪茄烟，从下午起就很少再抽了。
    贵宾勉励多生产
    下午，贵宾们参观了又一个在苏联帮助下刚在去年正式投入生产的电缆厂。伏老满意地看到这里已经大量生产各种不同的电缆，在车间里和许多工人进行了亲切的交谈，并一再叮咛这个厂的苏联专家，要很好地帮助中国工人掌握新技术。他向全体热烈欢迎他的工人说：“我们热爱和平和儿女们的幸福，但是帝国主义无时不在打算侵略我们，因此我们要生产更多的高压电缆，供应国防和工业上的需要，保证击败任何帝国主义的侵略。”
      当伏老参观完工厂后，还一再向工人们说，希望通过他们，向沈阳工人和全体市民致意，他虽然离开了这里，但是心还留在这里。
    归途中，马路两旁，人山人海，他们都想一睹伏老风采。
