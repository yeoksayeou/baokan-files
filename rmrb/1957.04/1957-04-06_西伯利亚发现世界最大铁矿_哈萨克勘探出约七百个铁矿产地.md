Xinhua News Agency, 5th dispatch. TASS reports: A new iron ore area of world significance has recently been discovered in the Tomsk Oblast of Siberia. According to preliminary calculations, the reserves of this vast iron ore area are approximately tens of billions of tons, making it at least one of the world's largest iron ore areas. This is because the reserves of the Lake Superior iron ore area in the United States, which is currently considered the world's largest, are only 23 billion tons.

This large ore area was discovered near the city of Kolpashevo in the Tomsk Oblast. Explorers have already drilled more than 80 boreholes within an area of approximately 1,200 square kilometers in the Kolpashevo region. Preliminary exploration results have proven that the ore seam in this iron ore deposit is approximately 12 meters thick, with an iron content of 36%. In individual sections, the iron content even reaches above 40%, which is higher than that of some of the world's famous iron ore mines.

The newly discovered Kolpashevo iron ore area is not far from Kuzbass and Krasnoyarsk, and it will make an important contribution to the establishment of the Soviet Union's third metallurgical industrial base in Siberia in the next 10 to 15 years.

Xinhua News Agency, 5th dispatch. TASS reports: The Kazakh Republic has explored approximately 700 iron ore deposits within its borders. According to preliminary statistics from the Institute of Geological Sciences of the Republic's Academy of Sciences, the currently proven reserves in these locations can meet the ore needs of at least ten giant metallurgical enterprises like the Karaganda Metallurgical Plant, which is under construction. Among the discovered iron ore deposits, there are some very large limonite deposits. In terms of limonite reserves, the Kazakh Republic is among the world's leaders.

Based on its rich mineral deposits, Kazakhstan is currently building a powerful metallurgical raw material base for the Soviet Union. The high-quality ore produced in the Kozhevskoye mining area, which is already in operation, is being continuously transported to twelve metallurgical plants in other parts of the Soviet Union. Construction of open-pit mines has already begun in the Sokolovskoye and Sarbaiskoye iron ore areas of the Kustanai Oblast. The Soviet Union's largest ore dressing complex is being built on the basis of these two mining areas.

The Atasui mining area in central Kazakhstan, which contains rich hematite-magnetite and manganese ore, will begin production before the end of the new Five-Year Plan. In Karaganda, not far from here, a giant metallurgical plant is under construction, and its production capacity will exceed that of the famous Kuznetsk Metallurgical Combine.

    西伯利亚发现世界最大铁矿
    哈萨克勘探出约七百个铁矿产地
    据新华社5日讯　据塔斯社报道：西伯利亚托木斯克州最近发现了一个具有世界意义的新铁矿区。据初步计算，这个巨大的铁矿区矿的储藏量约达几百亿吨，至少是世界最大铁矿区之一。因为，到目前为止，被认为是世界最大的美国苏必利尔湖铁矿区矿的储藏量也不过是二百三十亿吨。
    这个大矿区是在托木斯克州科尔帕谢沃城附近发现的。勘探人员在科尔帕谢沃地区约一千二百平方公里的面积内已经钻了八十多个钻孔。初步勘探结果证明，这个铁矿床的矿层厚度大约有十二公尺，含铁量达36％，在个别区段含铁量甚至高达40％以上，这比世界上一些著名的铁矿的含铁量要高。
    新发现的科尔帕谢沃铁矿区离库兹巴斯和克拉斯诺雅尔斯克都不远，它对于在今后十到十五年间在西伯利亚建立苏联第三个冶金工业基地将有重要贡献。
    据新华社5日讯　据塔斯社报道：哈萨克共和国已经在它的境内勘探出了大约七百个铁矿产地。据共和国科学院地质科学研究所初步统计，这些地方目前已经探明的储量能够满足至少十个像正在建设的卡拉干达冶金工厂这样巨大的冶金企业对矿砂的需要。在已经发现的铁矿产地中，有一些非常大的褐铁矿矿床。就褐铁矿储藏量来说，哈萨克共和国在世界上居于前列地位。
    在丰富的矿藏基础上，哈萨克目前正在建设苏联一个强大的冶金工业原料基地。已经在进行开采的科兹列夫斯克矿区所出产的质量很好的矿砂，正在源源不断地运往苏联其它地方的十二个冶金工厂。在库斯坦奈州索科洛夫斯克和萨尔巴伊铁矿区，露天采矿场的建设工程已经开始。在这两个矿区的基础上，正在建设苏联最大的选矿联合工厂。
    哈萨克中部的阿塔苏伊矿区蕴藏着丰富的赤铁—磁铁矿和锰矿，它将在新五年计划结束以前出矿。在离这里不远的卡拉干达，正在建设一个巨大的冶金工厂，它的生产能力将超过著名的库兹涅茨克冶金联合工厂。
