The Head of the Ministry of Textile Industry Answers Questions from Our Reporter

Textile Mills Strive to Increase Production of Yarn and Cloth, Hoping Farmers Will Sell More Surplus Cotton

(Reported by this newspaper) On April 20th, this newspaper's reporter interviewed the head of the Ministry of Textile Industry on the issue of increasing cotton cloth production. The questions raised by the reporter and the responses from the head of the Ministry of Textile Industry are as follows:

Q: Under the current circumstances, what measures does the textile industry plan to take to increase cotton cloth production?

A: In 1956, China's cotton yarn production reached 5.23 million bales, and cotton cloth production reached 174.89 million bolts. By the end of this year, the nation's total installed cotton spinning spindles will reach 7.5 million, an increase of 2.36 million spindles compared to 1949. This increase is equivalent to 46% of the total construction in the fifty years before liberation. The current production capacity of the cotton textile industry, if cotton supply is sufficient, can spin about 5.6 million bales of yarn and even more cloth annually. However, due to insufficient cotton supply, the maximum cotton yarn production this year can only be 4.63 million bales, which is a reduction of 600,000 bales compared to last year's actual production. Cotton cloth production will decrease by approximately 30 million bolts.

In response to the current situation where textile cotton cannot meet demand, the national textile industry has actively responded to the state's call for increased production and thrift, striving to save more raw materials while ensuring product quality, in order to produce more yarn and cloth for the people.

First, we believe that ensuring product quality and extending the product's service life is the greatest form of thrift. For example, if a piece of cloth clothing could originally be worn for three years, but due to poor quality, it can only be worn for two and a half years, then the market supply will be effectively tightened invisibly. This is unfavorable to both the state and consumers. Second, is to save cotton and yarn in every possible way while ensuring quality. Although the textile industry has made some achievements in this area in the past few years, the potential for savings is still significant. For example, cotton textile enterprises do not cherish cotton, and the amount of oily cotton, damaged yarn, and recovered cotton is considerable. Some enterprises do not fully utilize effective fibers in waste cotton, and the difference in waste cotton between different machines is large. We must make great efforts to overcome these shortcomings. In addition, we also adopt measures such as product classification and rational use of raw cotton to fully utilize low-grade raw cotton, scraps, and waste cotton to increase yarn and cloth production. We will fully utilize scraps and low-grade cotton to produce coarser yarns for fabrics to meet different needs. For example, fabrics such as lining cloth and flour sack cloth have lower quality requirements, so lower-grade raw materials are used for spinning. Many regions and enterprises have already made achievements in this area.

Third, is to appropriately change the specifications of certain products while ensuring product quality. Some cotton fabrics currently sold in the market have specifications that are not reasonable enough. For example, some jean and gabardine are too hard and thick, resulting in uneven dyeing and easy whitening. The cuffs, corners of clothes, and collars, which are frequently rubbed, are particularly prone to damage. Summer linen is not thin and fine enough. For these products, we plan to appropriately change the specifications without affecting quality and try to produce new products to meet the needs of the people.

Q: What requirements and expectations does the textile industry have for farmers?

A: In order to supply the people with as many textiles as possible, efforts are needed in two aspects. From the perspective of the textile industry, as mentioned earlier, we should strive to save more raw materials while ensuring quality. On the other hand, we require farmers to save cotton as much as possible and sell cotton to the state to support the production of the textile industry and the country's socialist industrialization. According to incomplete statistics from relevant departments, as of mid-February this year, the national purchase of lint cotton only reached 79.74% of the annual unified purchase task, while in the same period of 1956, 97% of the annual unified purchase task had been completed. The poor completion of this year's cotton purchase task is partly due to the fact that some farmers retained more cotton for their own use than in the past. This shows that if farmers give strong support to the country, the national cotton purchase task can be completed even better. We believe that the broad masses of farmers will certainly be able to meet our requirements.

    纺织工业部负责人答本报记者问
    纺织厂努力增产纱布　希望农民多售余棉
    本报讯　4月20日，本报记者就目前增产棉布的问题，访问纺织工业部负责人。本报记者提出的问题和纺织工业部负责人的答复如下：
    问：在目前情况下，纺织工业打算采取什么措施增产棉布？
    答：1956年我国棉纱产量已达到五百二十三万件，棉布产量达到一万七千四百八十九万匹。到今年年底，全国可投入生产的棉纺纱锭将达七百五十万枚，比1949年增加二百三十六万枚，等于解放前五十年建设总数的46％，目前棉纺织工业的生产能力，如棉花供应充足，则全年可纺纱五百六十万件左右，织布能力则更大。但是由于棉花供应不足，今年生产的棉纱最多只能有四百六十三万件，比去年的实际产量将减少六十万件，棉布产量将减少约三千万匹。
    针对着今年纺织用棉不能满足需要的情况，全国纺织工业已积极响应国家增产节约的号召，争取在保证产品质量的基础上，多节约些原料以便能为人民多生产些纱布。
    首先，我们认为保证产品质量，延长产品的使用时间，就是最大的节约。打个比方说，一件布衣服，本来可以穿三年的，但因为质量不好，实际上只穿了二年半，那就等于在无形中促使市场供应紧张，这不论对国家和消费者都是不利的。其次，是在保证质量的前提下，千方百计的节约用棉、用纱。纺织工业在过去几年中，虽然在这方面已取得一定的成绩，但节约的潜力还是不小的。如棉纺织企业不爱惜棉花，油花、坏纱、回丝等数目不小。有些企业落棉中有效纤维仍未充分利用，各个机台落棉差异相差较大。对这些缺点，都要大力设法克服。此外，我们还采取产品分类，合理使用原棉，以充分利用低级原棉和下脚、废棉，增产纱布的措施，充分利用下脚、低级棉，增制些粗支纱的织物来供应不同的需要。如里子布、面粉袋布等织物因对质量的要求较低，就采用低级的原料来纺制。目前已有不少地区和企业在这方面作出了成绩。
    再次，是在保证产品质量的前提下，适当改变某些产品的规格。目前市场上销售的棉布中，有些布的规格是不够合理的。如某些线卡其和华达呢太硬太厚，因而染色不透，容易发白，袖口、衣角和衣领等常磨擦的地方特别容易破。夏季用的麻纱也不够细薄。对于这些产品在不影响质量的前提下，我们准备适当改变规格，试制些新产品，以满足人民的需要。
    问：纺织工业对农民有什么要求和希望？
    答：为了尽可能多供应人民一些纺织品，需要从两个方面来努力。从纺织工业部门来说，如前所说应该在保证质量的前提下，力求多节约一些原料；另一方面就要求农民兄弟尽力节约用棉，把棉花卖给国家，以支援纺织工业的生产，支援国家的社会主义工业化。根据有关部门的不完全统计，截至今年2月中旬止，全国已收购皮棉仅达全年统购任务的79.74％，而1956年同期则已完成全年统购任务的97％。今年棉花收购任务完成得不好，有些农民弟兄留自用棉比过去多，是原因之一。这说明，如果农民弟兄对国家大力支援，国家收购棉花的任务是可以完成得更好些的。我们相信广大的农民弟兄，一定能满足我们的要求。
