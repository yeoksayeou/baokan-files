    According to the Cairo "Evening News" on the 18th, citing Amman sources, eighty officers of the Jordanian army requested King Hussein of Jordan on April 16 to issue a statement on the reasons for the dismissal of Major General Nawar, and demanded that he immediately investigate the events that occurred in Zarqa.

    约旦国王任命哈亚里为陆军参谋长
    据新华社19日讯　安曼消息：约旦国王17日任命阿里·哈亚里为约旦陆军参谋长，以代替在上星期约旦动荡的局势中被迫离职的诺瓦尔。
    侯赛因同时还宣布任命贝都印家族（沙漠部落）的马贾利为副参谋长。
    哈亚里曾经在英国的陆军大学受过训练，后来领导前阿拉伯军团的军事作战部门。在诺瓦尔离职前，他是陆军副参谋长。
    据开罗“晚报”18日援引安曼人士的话报道，有八十个约旦军队的军官曾经在4月16日要求约旦国王侯赛因对解除诺瓦尔少将职务的理由发表声明，并且要求他对扎卡发生的事件立即进行调查。
