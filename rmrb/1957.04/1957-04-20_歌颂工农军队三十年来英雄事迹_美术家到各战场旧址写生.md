To Celebrate the Thirtieth Anniversary of the Founding of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army “August 1st” Army Day, more than 300 artists organized by the Cultural Department of the Central Military Commission are now working intensely on their creations.

To praise the heroic deeds of this workers’ and peasants’ army over the past thirty years, many artists have gone to various revolutionary base areas, former battlefield sites, and along the route of the Red Army's Long March to experience life and make sketches. Painters Dong Shouping, Pu Songchuang, Li Fangbai, Tao Yiqing, Yan Di, and others went to Jinsha River, Wujiang River, Aba, and other places for their collective creation of a fifteen-person "Long March Scroll"; this scroll is divided into three sections, the second of which (from crossing the Jinsha River to flying over the Luding Bridge) has a preliminary draft, measuring more than ten zhang in length. Painter Wang Shikuo went to Jinggang Mountain in Jiangxi to create "Jinggang Mountain Meeting"; Wu Zuoren is preparing to depict the life of the People's Navy and is currently in Qingdao; Zong Qixiang plans to create "Seventeen Heroes Forcibly Crossing the Dadu River" and has been to Anshunchang in Xikang; Yan Han returned to the Taihang Mountains, where he worked during the War of Resistance Against Japan, to create "The Eighth Route Army Crossing the Yellow River to Penetrate Behind Enemy Lines"; Gu Yuan and An Lin also returned to Yan'an to depict the life of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region; Hu Yichuan went to Jiajin Mountain to create "The Red Army Crossing the Snowy Mountains"; Mo Pu went to Jiangxi to create "Nanchang Uprising". More than 300 other artists, such as Zhang Jianwen, Hua Tianyou, Xiao Chuanjiu, Huang Xinbo, Wang Shenglie, and Yin Shoushi, are also drawing on the materials they need in our vast and magnificent country. From Changbai Mountain to Hainan Island, from the north and south of Tianshan Mountains to Yijiangshan Island, wherever the PLA has set foot and fought heroically, artists are engaged in creative activities.

Some paintings have now completed initial drafts, while others are repeatedly conceiving and considering compositions. The creative activity has entered a tense stage.

It is expected that around 250 works will be displayed to the public on August 1st this year, the thirtieth anniversary of the founding of the army.

    歌颂工农军队三十年来英雄事迹
    美术家到各战场旧址写生
    本报讯　为迎接中国人民解放军“八一”建军三十周年纪念，由中央军委文化部组织的全国三百余位美术家现在正紧张地进行创作。
    美术家们为了歌颂这支工农军队三十年来的英雄事迹，很多人都到各根据地、各战场旧址和当年红军长征的沿途体验生活，并进行写生。画家董寿平、溥松窗、李方白、陶一清、颜地等为他们十五人集体创作的“长征画卷”，曾前往金沙江、乌江、阿坝等地；这幅画卷共分三段，其中第二段（从过金沙江到飞过泸定桥）已初拟草稿，计长十余丈。画家王式廓为创作“井岗山会师”，曾去江西井岗山；吴作人准备表现人民海军的生活，现仍在青岛；宗其香拟作“十七勇士强渡大渡河”，曾去西康安顺场；彦涵为创作“八路军东渡黄河深入敌后”，而重返他在抗日时工作过的地方——太行山；古元、安林为表现陕甘宁边区的生活，也重回延安；胡一川在创作“红军过雪山”，曾去夹金山；莫朴在创作“南昌起义”，曾去江西。其他如张建文、滑田友、肖传玖、黄新波、王盛烈、尹瘦石等三百余位美术家，也都在我幅员辽阔、山河壮丽的国土上，汲取他们所需要的素材。自长白山到海南岛，自天山南北到一江山岛，凡是解放军足迹所到和曾进行过英勇战斗的地方，都有美术家们进行创作活动。
    现在有的画已完成初稿，有的正反复构思，考虑构图。创作活动已进入了一个紧张的阶段。
    预计今年8月1日建军三十周年纪念日时，将有二百五十幅左右的作品同观众见面。
