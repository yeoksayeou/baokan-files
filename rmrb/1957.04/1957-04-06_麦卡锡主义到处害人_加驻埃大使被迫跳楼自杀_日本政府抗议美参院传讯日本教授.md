　　Canadian Ambassador to Egypt Forced to Commit Suicide
　　Japanese Government Protests US Senate Subpoena of Japanese Professor
　　Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 5th - Canadian Ambassador to Egypt, Herbert Norman, committed suicide on the 4th by jumping from the top floor of a nine-story building.
　　The Canadian Embassy in Egypt issued a statement saying that the ambassador was very upset by allegations made by a committee of the U.S. Senate accusing him of being pro-communist.
　　A letter he wrote to the Swedish Minister to Egypt was found in his pocket, stating: "I have no other way out. I must kill myself, because I have no hope of living."
　　Xinhua News Agency, Ottawa, 5th - The suicide of Canadian Ambassador to Egypt, Herbert Norman, on the 4th has caused a strong reaction throughout Canada. All Canadian political parties unanimously pointed out that Norman was a victim of political persecution by the U.S. Congress.
　　The Canadian Parliament began its session on the 4th by first expressing condolences to Norman. Foreign Minister Pearson said in Parliament that one of the reasons for Norman's suicide was the repeated accusations by the U.S. Congress that he had been a communist.
　　Pearson said: "Such tricks adopted by certain figures in the United States against Norman can only show the moral degradation of those who use these tricks."
　　Conservative Party leader John Diefenbaker said in Parliament that Norman's suicide was caused by "the persecution mania of certain elements in the Washington Congress who are in the business of persecution." Cooperative Commonwealth Federation spokesman, Skilling, said that Norman was a victim of "murder by slander" by the U.S. Congress.
　　United Church of Canada spokesman, Ernest Long, also issued a statement saying that the responsibility for Norman's death lies with the subcommittee of the U.S. Senate.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 5th - The Japanese government's protest against the U.S. Senate Internal Security Subcommittee's subpoena of Japanese Professor Tsuru Shigeto was submitted to the U.S. State Department yesterday morning. Japanese embassy officials expressed the Japanese government's dissatisfaction with the U.S. Senate Internal Security Subcommittee's action. They told the State Department that any time a country's citizen is to be questioned in this manner, his government should be notified in advance.
　　Japanese Foreign Minister Nobusuke Kishi said at a cabinet meeting today that the U.S. State Department had given the Japanese Foreign Ministry an official document expressing regret over the subpoena of Tsuru Shigeto.
　　Tsuru Shigeto is a professor at Hitotsubashi University. He came to Harvard University this year as a Japanese government official. He was subpoenaed by the U.S. Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on March 26 and 27 to question his activities while studying at Harvard University before the war. This incident aroused public anger in Japan.
　　Japan Socialist Party member Nohara Satoru criticized the U.S. Senate Internal Security Subcommittee's subpoena of Tsuru Shigeto at a meeting of the House of Representatives Education Committee yesterday, saying that it tarnished the reputation of Japanese independence.

    麦卡锡主义到处害人
    加驻埃大使被迫跳楼自杀
    日本政府抗议美参院传讯日本教授
    新华社开罗5日电　加拿大驻埃及大使赫伯特·诺曼4日从一座九层楼房的最高一层跳楼自杀。
    加拿大驻埃及大使馆发表声明说，这位大使对美国参议院的一个委员会指责他亲共一事感到非常烦恼。
    在他的口袋里发现他写给瑞典驻埃及公使的一封信，信里写道：“我没有别的路了。我必须自杀，因为我活着没有希望了。”
    据新华社5日讯　渥太华消息：加拿大驻埃及大使赫伯特·诺曼的自杀案件4日在整个加拿大引起了强烈的反应。加拿大各政党一致指出诺曼是美国国会政治迫害下的牺牲者。
    加拿大议会4日会议开始时首先对诺曼表示哀悼。外交部长皮尔逊在议会上说，诺曼的自杀原因之一就是由于美国国会接连两次指责他曾经是共产党人。
    皮尔逊说：美国某些人物对诺曼所采取的“这种伎俩只能表示采用这些伎俩的人的人格堕落而已”。
    加拿大保守党领袖约翰·迪芬贝克在议会上说，诺曼的自杀是“华盛顿国会中的某些以迫害为业的分子的迫害恶癖”所促成的。加拿大合作联盟发言人斯齐尔特说，诺曼是美国国会“用诽谤来进行谋杀”的一个受害人。
    加拿大联合教会发言人欧奈斯特·朗也发表声明说，诺曼之死，责任在于美国参议院的小组委员会。
    据新华社5日讯　日本政府抗议美国参议院国内安全小组委员会传讯日本教授都留重人的抗议书已经在昨天上午送交美国国务院。日本大使馆官员表达了日本政府对美国参议院国内安全小组委员会这种行动的不满。他们告诉国务院说，凡是要这样讯问一个国家的公民，都要事前通知他的政府。
    日本外务相岸信介今天在阁员会议上说，美国国务院已经给日本外务省一份正式文件，对传讯都留重人这件事表示遗憾。
    都留重人是日本国立一桥大学的教授。他在今年以日本政府官员的身份到美国哈佛大学讲学。他曾经在3月26日和27日两天被美国参议院国内安全小组委员会传讯，讯问他战前在哈佛大学念书时期的活动。这件事激起了日本公众的愤怒。
    日本社会党议员野原觉昨天在众议院文教委员会的会议上指责美国参议院国内安全小组委员会传讯都留重人的行为玷污了日本独立的名誉。
