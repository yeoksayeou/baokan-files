Spring on the Shores of Taihu Lake
By our reporters Zhen Weimin and Shi Yue'e

The clamorous lake water beats against the rocks on the shore, as if announcing to the people living by the lake: Spring is here, spring is here! If you want a good harvest, you must get started early.

In fact, long before the message of spring arrived, the farmers by Taihu Lake had already thrown themselves into diverse productive activities. When Taihu Lake was still frozen, people broke the ice and went down to the lake to dredge mud, accumulating natural fertilizer for this year's production. In the plum and loquat orchards, people devised methods to protect against frost and snow, protecting the tender buds from the ravages of the cold.

We went from Suzhou to Zhenhu Township in Guangfu District, Wuxian County, which is surrounded by the lake on three sides. The closer we got to Taihu Lake, the more the green wheat seedlings grew particularly neatly and robustly. People were up early and working late, applying additional fertilizer to the wheat fields and mulberry fields. We knew that striving for a bumper summer harvest was the first battle in the Taihu area to achieve a bumper harvest for the whole year. Therefore, we asked the cadres and farmers of this township, how confident were they of achieving a bumper wheat harvest? They immediately pointed out many differences between this year's wheat and previous years: In the past, individual farmers grew wheat, mostly using local varieties; last year, the whole township grew it collectively, using the high-yield fine variety "2419"; in the past, there was little base fertilizer and more topdressing fertilizer applied when planting wheat; last year, both base and topdressing fertilizers were applied adequately; moreover, in the past, only about 12 jin of seeds were sown per mu, while last year 18 to 20 jin were sown per mu; and last year in March, when there was no rain, most of the wheat fields were watered with machines. The director of Yongxing No. 28 Cooperative said: "This year's wheat is growing so well, and everyone is so enthusiastic, so at the county's bumper harvest representative meeting, I was confident enough to take the lead in challenging and striving to become a thousand-jin cooperative."

On the second day of arriving in Zhenhu Township, a fine drizzle floated over the lake. However, even on this rainy day, it was difficult to find an idle person in Xihua Town where we were staying. The people here were racing against time. They had already accumulated enough topdressing fertilizer for the summer harvest, and were also accumulating natural fertilizer for the autumn harvest. In the misty dawn, the team leaders, wearing straw raincoats and rowing their boats, led the fleet on an expedition. The members always came back to eat breakfast only after dredging a boatload of river mud, and did not stop working until dinner time. The farmers boasted that Taihu Lake was their inexhaustible fertilizer warehouse.

At first, we thought that for people living near Taihu Lake, taking mud from Taihu Lake was nothing unusual. But when we arrived in Jilong Township, we further learned that in the past, the river mud fertilizer they needed was all brought by farmers from Jiangbei by boat. Only after organizing cooperatives did they buy twenty-eight farm boats to go to the lake to dredge mud. Gu Xiangrong, the deputy director of Jixing No. 2 Cooperative, went to the lake to dredge mud after the ice melted in January this year, and fell into the mud boat three times in succession, almost falling into Taihu Lake. Therefore, some people used a straw rope to tie their bodies to the mud dredging boat to ensure that they would not fall into Taihu Lake during intense labor.

In Zhenhu Township, we took the cooperative's mud dredging boat and sailed five li across the lake to Jilong Township, known as the "Land of Flowers and Fruits." The famous Dengwei Mountain "Plum Blossom Viewing" and Xiangxuehai "Plum Blossom Appreciation" scenic spots are located in this township.

In fact, it is not only a beautiful and lovely landscape, but more lovable is that the people here are full of vigorous vitality. The spring production activities of the people here are busier than any other season. Some cooperative members are carrying pig and sheep ash and river mud to fertilize osmanthus trees, plum trees, and mulberry seedlings; some cooperative members are reclaiming wasteland to sow tea seeds; some are transplanting rose seedlings and palm seedlings; some are grafting lilac flowers and honey peach seedlings. The deputy director of sideline production of Yongxing No. 15 Cooperative told us that in the past, individual households were busy enough planting mu of paddy fields and a few fen of flowers and fruit trees, but this year the cooperative is even busier. You see, they have just added thirty kinds of precious flowers and trees from Shanghai, Dongshan and other places, including more than two thousand dragon cypresses, more than two thousand palms, more than sixteen thousand roses, as well as peonies, camellias, crabapples, apples... They bought as much as three thousand jin of various flower and tree seeds, and the grafting of lilacs, bayberries, and peaches cannot differ by more than a week. Moreover, 140 units from eight provinces and cities across the country, including Beijing, Shanghai, Heilongjiang, Hubei, Zhejiang, and Anhui, have already placed orders for saplings to green the motherland, and tens of thousands of saplings must be transported out before Qingming. In spring, every moment here is worth a thousand gold!

"Let the motherland be shaded by green trees, and let our cooperative bloom with a hundred flowers." This is the ideal of every ordinary cooperative member here.

This deputy director of sideline production is already forty-seven years old this year. Thirty years ago, he learned a set of grafting skills from a wealthy peasant relative. Relying on his skills, he managed a few mu of flowers and fruit trees and lived a comfortable life. The tide of cooperation once stirred up waves in his heart. He was afraid that after cooperation, the fruit trees would be undervalued when they were put into the cooperative, so he sold two newly grafted weeping crabapple seedlings in his nursery elsewhere. Since then, this precious flower variety has become extinct in this township.

Last year, after cooperation, not only were the fruit trees fairly and reasonably valued by the cooperative, but also, people said he was experienced and elected him as the production team leader. This old farmer deeply regretted that his thinking was too muddled, but what could he do?

Since the Spring Festival this year, he has only had four days at home in nearly a month, and the rest of the time he has been sent by the cooperative to Shanghai, Dongshan and other places to purchase seedlings and flower seeds. He ran all over the distribution institutions of the flower and tree companies in the northern and western suburbs of Shanghai, and in the past landlord's courtyards and corners in Dongshan, he helped the cooperative find nearly thirty new varieties of flowers and trees, but he could not find a weeping crabapple. His wish had not yet been fulfilled, so he entrusted a friend in Dongshan to look for it on his behalf, and sure enough, he found a weeping crabapple in Xijia's household and bought it back.

When we visited this old farmer, he was planting and grafting this precious flower and tree with a young cooperative member who was less than twenty years old. This old tree is more than twelve chi tall, twelve times taller than the seedling he sold, and has about eighty or ninety branches on it. According to Team Leader Yang, after it is planted and survives, this crabapple can be turned into seventy or eighty trees. From then on, the weeping crabapple will not be cut off in this cooperative.

He said to us meaningfully: "As the saying goes: 'The predecessors planted trees, and the descendants enjoy the shade.' The situation here is different. The trees are planted and survive, and they are sold to the state. Now we want to green the motherland. We are willing to let all the major cities in Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Nanjing plant our flower and fruit seedlings."

    春在太湖之滨
    本报记者　甄为民　史越峨
    喧闹的湖水，拍打着岸边的岩石，好像通知湖滨人家：春来了，春来了，要想丰收，就得趁早。
    其实，早在春天的信息到来之前，太湖边的农民已经投入了多样性的生产行动。当太湖还封冻着的时候，人们破冰下湖罱泥，为今年生产增积自然肥料；在梅园、枇杷园里，人们设法防霜打雪，保护幼嫩的蓓蕾不受严寒摧残。
    我们是从苏州到吴县光福区三面临湖的镇湖乡去的。越是走近太湖，一片绿油油的麦苗长得特别整齐茁壮，人们起早带晚在为麦田、桑地追肥。我们知道争取夏熟丰收是太湖地区争取全年丰收的第一仗。因此，我们问这个乡的干部和农民，争取小麦丰收的把握怎么样？他们马上说出了今年的麦子和往年有许多不同的地方：前年种麦是个体农民种的，大部是土种，去年全乡都是集体种的，种的都是高产良种“2419”；前年种麦基肥少，追肥多，去年种麦基肥追肥都很充分；而且前年每亩下种只有十二斤左右，而去年每亩下种十八斤到二十斤；在去年3月不雨的时候，大部分麦田用机器打水，浇灌了麦苗。永星二十八社的社主任说：“今年的麦子长得这样好，大家的劲头又大，所以，在县里的丰产代表会议上，我就有信心带头挑战，争取成为千斤社。”
    到镇湖乡的第二天，湖上飘来霏霏细雨。可是，在这下雨的日子里，我们住的西华镇上要找一个闲人也是困难的。这里的人们正在跟时间赛跑。他们已经积足了夏熟的追肥，又在为秋熟积聚自然肥料。细雨蒙蒙的拂晓，小队长们就披了蓑衣，摇着橹，带领船队出征去了。社员们总是罱完了一船河泥才回来吃早饭，而到吃晚饭的时候还没有收工。农民们夸耀太湖是他们的取之不尽的肥料仓库。
    我们起初认为，靠近太湖边的人家，下太湖取泥算不得什么稀奇。可是到了纪龙乡，才进一步了解到，原来他们过去需要的河泥肥料，都是请江北的农民带船来代劳的。组织合作社以后，才买了二十八条农船，下湖罱泥。纪星二社副主任顾祥荣今年1月开冻后下湖罱泥，就先后跌在泥船里三次，差一点掉在太湖里。因此，有人用一根草绳，把身体系在罱泥船上，以保证激烈劳动时，人不会掉下太湖。
    在镇湖乡乘社里的罱泥船，荡过五里路的一段湖面，来到了“花果之乡”的纪龙乡。著名的邓尉山“探梅”、香雪海“观梅”等胜景，就在这个乡里。
      事实上，这里不仅风景绮丽可爱，更可爱的是这里的人们充满了蓬勃的朝气。这里的人们的春季生产活动比任何一季更加忙碌。有的社员正在挑猪羊灰、河泥垩桂花树、梅树、桑苗；有的社员正在开垦荒地播种茶籽；有的在移栽玫瑰花秧、棕榈树苗；有的在剪接丁香花和水蜜桃树苗。永星十五社的副业队长告诉我们，往年单家独户种亩稻田和几分花果地就忙得不得了，今年社里就更忙了，你看，刚从上海、东山等地增添了三十种名贵的花木，有二千多株龙柏，二千多株棕榈，一万六千多株玫瑰，还有牡丹、山茶、海棠、苹果……。光是各种花树种子就买了三千斤，丁香、杨梅、桃子的剪接，在时间上又不能相差一个星期以上。况且，全国已经有北京、上海、黑龙江、湖北、浙江、安徽等八个省、市一百四十个单位来向他们订购树苗，绿化祖国，几万株树苗都要在清明以前运出去。春天，在这里，真是一刻值千金啊！
    “让祖国绿树成荫，让我们社里百花齐放”，这就是这里每一个普通社员的理想。
    这位副业队长今年已经四十七岁了，三十年前他从一个富农亲戚那里学会了一套接树的本领。凭着自己的本领，经营着几亩花果地，过着小康之家的生活。合作化的浪潮，曾经激起了他心头的波澜，他曾怕合作化之后，果树折价入社会吃亏，他把苗圃里两株刚刚接活的垂丝海棠苗卖给别处去了。从此，这个乡里，这种名贵的花种也就绝种了。
    去年合作化以后，非但社里果树折价公平合理，而且，人们说他有经验，还选他当了生产队长。这个老农，深深后悔自己思想太糊涂，可是有什么办法呢？
    从今年春节开始，将近一个月的时间，他只有四天时间在家，其余的时间都是社里派他到上海、东山等地去采购树苗和花种。他跑遍上海北郊、西郊的花木公司的分销机构，在东山过去地主的庄院里，墙角边，帮助社里找到了近三十种新的花木品种，就是没有找到一株垂丝海棠。他心愿还没有了结，因此，拜托了东山一个朋友代为找寻，果然在席家户头找到了一株垂丝海棠，并把它买回来了。
    我们访问这位老农的时候，他正在和一个不满二十岁的青年社员在栽种、压接这株名贵的花木。这株老树有一丈二尺多高，比他卖出的那株苗高十二倍，上面大概有八、九十个杈枝。据杨队长说，栽活以后，这一株海棠，就可以变成七、八十株。从此，这个社里，垂丝海棠也不会断根了。
    他意味深长地对我们说：“常言说：‘前人栽树，后人乘凉’。我们这里的情况可不同，树木栽活了，是卖给国家的，现在要绿化祖国，我们愿意让北京、上海、武汉、南京各大城市里都栽上我们的花果苗木。”
