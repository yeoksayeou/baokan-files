    China's Second Large-Scale Iron and Steel Base
    Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex Begins Construction
    Completion of First Phase in 1961 Will Increase China's Steel Production by One-Third Based on Current Levels
    (Our dispatch from Hankou, April 8th) The main factory buildings of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex officially commenced construction today.
    The first to begin construction is the refractory materials plant. This plant is one of the main components of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex. In addition to producing commonly used refractory bricks for WISCO, it also undertakes the task of supplying refractory bricks to other factories. This plant includes five workshops for clay high-alumina bricks, silica bricks, lime calcination, dolomite, and fireclay, as well as more than forty individual projects. The groundbreaking work today includes the lime calcination workshop, the general warehouse, the raw material warehouses for clay high-alumina bricks and silica bricks, and various auxiliary facility projects.
    Auxiliary projects such as the mechanical repair workshop of the coking and chemical plant and the material spare parts warehouse also began construction simultaneously.
    According to the national approved construction plan, there are a total of five main factory buildings of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex that will be successively constructed this year. In addition to the refractory materials plant and the coking and chemical plant, there are also the No. 1 blast furnace of the ironmaking plant, the ore dressing plant, and the sintering plant. Approximately two hundred other individual projects will also commence construction within the year. In addition, the Daye Iron Mine, which began expansion in August 1955, will recover 200,000 tons of iron ore this year through a large amount of mountain stripping work.
    The Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex is a key construction project that the state stipulated to begin construction in the first Five-Year Plan. It will use the iron ore from Daye to make iron and the coal from Fengfeng, Pingxiang, and Huainan to make coke. It includes fifteen main production plants and mines, such as mining, ore dressing, sintering, ironmaking, steelmaking, steel rolling, coking and chemical, and refractory materials, as well as more than thirty auxiliary production workshops and affiliated workshops. It is a complete large-scale iron and steel complex. It will be equipped with large blast furnaces and large open-hearth furnaces. Its equipment and technology are not only unprecedented in Chinese history but also world-class.
    The first phase of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex will be completed in 1961. After completion, it will be able to produce 1.5 million tons of steel annually, and it can also supply a large amount of various steel products needed by China's machinery industry and other industries. After the first phase of WISCO is completed and put into production, it will increase China's total steel production by more than one-third based on the existing level.
    Currently, the builders of WISCO are enthusiastically throwing themselves into the construction upsurge. The people who are building the heating power plant and affiliated enterprises have already moved into the new construction site. The concrete produced by the mixing building of the affiliated enterprise is transported to the refractory material plant construction site by a dump truck every seven minutes. On the vast construction site, rows of construction scaffolding and construction rain shelters have been newly erected. The Wuhan Metallurgical Construction General Company has dispatched its strongest cadres to lead the construction of these key projects. The employees of the engineering company directly responsible for the construction of the refractory material plant have put forward the guarantee that this plant will be built into the best quality factory. Production, construction, and design units have established a joint command organization to uniformly lead the construction of these projects. (Xiao Ding, Chen Mu)

    我国第二个规模巨大的钢铁基地
    武汉钢铁联合企业开始建厂
    1961年建成第一期工程后将使我国钢铁产量在现有基础上增加三分之一
    本报汉口8日电　武汉钢铁联合企业的主体厂房今天宣告正式开工。
    第一个开工的是耐火材料厂。这个厂是武汉钢铁联合企业主要组成部分之一，除了为武钢生产经常用的耐火砖外，还担负有供应其他工厂耐火砖的任务。这个厂包括有粘土高铝砖、硅砖、石灰焙烧、白云石、火泥等五个车间和四十多个单项工程。这次破土开工的，有石灰焙烧车间、总仓库、粘土高铝砖和硅砖的原料仓库，以及各种辅助设施工程。
    炼焦化工厂的机械修理车间，以及材料备品仓库等辅助工程，也同时动工兴建。
    根据国家批准的建设计划，武汉钢铁联合企业今年将陆续动工兴建的主体厂房共有五个，除耐火材料厂、炼焦化工厂外，还有炼铁厂的一号高炉、选矿厂、烧结厂。其它二百个左右的单项工程，也将在年内开工。另外，1955年8月开始扩建的大冶铁矿，今年将在大量的山石剥离工程中，回收二十万吨铁矿石。
    武汉钢铁联合企业是国家第一个五年计划规定开始兴建的重点建设工程。它将利用大冶的铁矿来炼铁，利用峰峰、萍乡、淮南等地的煤来炼焦。它包括采矿、选矿、烧结、炼铁、炼钢、轧钢、炼焦化工和耐火材料等十五个主体生产厂矿和三十多个辅助生产车间及附属车间，是一个完整的大型钢铁联合企业。它将用大高炉和大平炉装备起来，它的设备和技术之先进不但是我国历史上所未有，也是世界上第一流的。
    武汉钢铁联合企业的第一期工程将在1961年建成，建成以后，每年可以产钢一百五十万吨，还可以大量供应我国机械工业和其他工业所需要的各种钢材。武钢第一期工程建成和投入生产以后，将使我国钢铁生产总量在现有基础上增加三分之一以上。
    现在，武钢的建设者们正欢欣鼓舞地投入施工高潮。建筑热电厂和附属企业的人们，已经移入新的施工场地。附属企业搅拌楼生产的混凝土，每隔七分钟就有一辆自卸卡车运送往耐火材料厂工地。在辽阔的工地上，新搭起了一排排建筑脚手架和施工防雨棚。武汉冶金建筑总公司已抽出最强的干部领导这些重点工程施工。直接负责耐火材料厂施工的工程公司的职工们，提出了要将这个厂建成质量最好的工厂的保证。生产、施工、设计等单位已成立了联合指挥机构，统一领导这些工程的施工。（肖定、陈牧）
