    Japanese Workers' Spring Struggle
    Pei Da
    Beginning in early March, Japanese workers launched a large-scale spring struggle. The main goals of the struggle are: to strive for a monthly wage increase of 2,000 yen and to establish a minimum wage system. This struggle, led by the strongly organized coal miners and national railway workers, is advancing in waves across the country. In mid-March, the struggle entered its "third wave" and reached its climax. Employees in the coal industry, national and private railways, chemical industry, and public corporations have achieved victories of increasing monthly salaries from 1,200 to 2,000 yen, opening the way for the national struggle for wage increases for workers. From March 26, workers across the country launched a struggle to establish a minimum wage system.
    The Japanese workers' spring struggle is a struggle to demand improved treatment and to fight for the democratic rights of workers. To counter the monopoly capitalists' policy of minimizing wages as much as possible, Japanese workers have proposed a minimum wage of 8,000 yen and demanded that it be enshrined in national law. If this struggle can be won, it will become illegal for capitalists to lower wages below 8,000 yen, and Japanese workers will be able to fight effectively to defend their right to live.
    This spring struggle is taking place against the backdrop that Japan's industrial and mining production level is now 1.3 times higher than before the war, while workers' living standards have not exceeded pre-war levels. According to a survey by the Japanese Ministry of Finance, the internal and external funds of Japanese enterprises in the ten years after the war amounted to 12 trillion yen, 1.4 times more than the 5 trillion yen in the ten years before the war. All of this has been squeezed from the Japanese working people. According to statistics from Japanese economists, from 1946 to 1953, the surplus value extracted from Japanese workers totaled 7.3 trillion yen. Japanese monopoly capital is insatiable. On the one hand, it tries every means to force workers to increase their labor intensity and improve labor efficiency; on the other hand, it tries to use as few workers as possible and suppress wage increases. Comparing 1955 with 1951, the level of industrial and mining production increased by 65%, labor efficiency increased by 48%, while the number of industrial workers increased by only 11%, and wages increased by only 22%. In other words, Japanese monopoly capitalists have made a fortune, while the lives of Japanese workers have become increasingly difficult.
    For the past eleven years since the war, Japanese workers have been waging heroic struggles to improve their lives. The scale of this year's spring struggle has exceeded the expectations of the Japanese government and monopoly capital, demonstrating the unity and tenacious fighting spirit of Japanese workers. On March 11, workers across the country took unified action. Because the Japanese government has enacted the "Public Corporation Labor Relations Law" and the "National Public Service Law," public enterprises and government employees, who have been deprived of the right to strike, have adopted ways of struggle such as taking leave and holding meetings. National railway workers stopped working by holding mass rallies, causing seventy-five passenger trains and three hundred and forty-six freight trains to be suspended. The Japanese government carried out violent suppression of railway workers. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department sent 3,500 plainclothes police officers to stop the railway workers' struggle. However, the National Railway Workers' Union held a six-hour rally before the scheduled time, leaving the police authorities at a loss. On this day, 15,000 telephone and telegraph workers and 6,000 postal workers carried out leave struggles. More than 500,000 members of the National Teachers' Union also ended classes early and held rallies in more than 8,500 locations.
    In particular, the private railway workers' union and the coal miners' union took unified action, strengthening the momentum of the struggle. The private railway workers' union broke the convention of the past ten years and changed the tactic of holiday strikes that had been used consistently, participating in the unified strike struggle. The coal miners changed the past situation where various mines could not strike together and unified their actions this year. They started refusing to work overtime on March 4, went on strike for forty-eight hours on the 7th, and started a seventy-two-hour strike on the 11th, and decided to hold an indefinite strike from the 16th. This powerful action forced the capitalists to accept the condition of increasing monthly wages by 1,300 yen relatively quickly.
    In the unified struggle, workers in various enterprises supported each other and demonstrated the spirit of unity and friendship. When workers of the Kyushu Moji National Railway held a workers' congress, 6,000 coal miners who were on strike went to support them. When workers at the Omuta Miike Coal Mine held a seventy-two-hour strike, national railway workers refused to unload goods on the mine's dedicated line. Some station masters, after being persuaded and explained by the union, refused police interference. In Iwate Prefecture, more than 2,500 family members of teachers participated in the teachers' congress.
    Driven by the workers of large enterprises, workers in small and medium-sized enterprises in various places also launched heroic struggles. The Osaka Nomura Seisakusho Labor Union (with 117 members) launched an indefinite strike to fight for wage increases. They held a workers' representative meeting during the strike and enthusiastically discussed the minimum wage system. Workers at US military bases were also involved in the struggle. When female workers at the Tachikawa base went on strike, they received the support of the base's labor union.
    The Japanese workers' reasonable demands have also won the sympathy of the vast number of farmers. Sixty representatives of residents of Sunagawa Town Military Base specially took a large bus to visit the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the Tokyo Regional Council of Trade Unions, the National Railway Workers' Union, and the Coal Miners' Union, expressing their warm support.
    In this struggle, temporary workers began to take organized action. After World War II, monopoly capitalists hired temporary workers as much as possible to earn more money. For example, in the chemical industry, temporary workers account for about 14% of the total number of workers, while temporary workers in small and medium-sized metal mines reach 25.6%. The wages of temporary workers are only about half of the wages of permanent workers. In 1956, the average daily wage of permanent workers was 527 yen, while temporary workers could only get 381 yen per day on average. A large number of temporary workers cannot enjoy labor insurance benefits, and their working conditions are very poor. In order to strive to become formal workers, they have to work desperately. The capitalists hire a large number of temporary workers, also with the political purpose of splitting the workers' movement, because temporary workers do not have union organizations. In early March this year, 500 representatives of temporary workers gathered in Tokyo and exchanged struggle experiences with representatives of powerful trade unions. The meeting discussed organizational issues and decided to establish a local agreement council for temporary workers and a national agreement council for temporary workers to fight in an organized way for the right to live. This meeting marked a new development in the Japanese workers' movement.
    The Japanese government and monopoly capital adopted police actions and deceptive means against the workers' struggle. In order to save the crisis of fuel shortage and insufficient transportation capacity, they made some concessions to the coal miners and railway workers relatively quickly. After the powerful trade union organizations achieved initial victories, the bourgeois newspapers vigorously promoted "the spring struggle has ended" in order to undermine the workers' united action and weaken the national workers' struggle. Some trade union organizations also failed to adhere to the original "strength struggle" plan, so that the struggle for establishing a minimum wage system lacked sufficient strength. Now, this struggle is still continuing, but as the Japanese "Akahata" newspaper pointed out, in order to expand the victory of the spring struggle, Japanese workers need to strengthen unity and push the struggle further forward.

    日本工人的春季斗争
    裴达
    从3月初开始，日本工人掀起了大规模的春季斗争。斗争的主要目标是：争取增加月薪二千日元，制定最低工资制。这一斗争以组织坚强的煤矿工人和国营铁道工人为前锋，波浪式地向全国各地推进。3月中，斗争进入“第三波”，达到了高潮。煤炭业、国营和私营铁道、化学工业以及公共企业机关的职工，分别取得了增加月薪一千二百元到二千日元的胜利，给全国工人增加工资的斗争打开了道路。从3月26日起，全国各地工人为制定最低工资制展开了斗争。
    日本工人的春季斗争，是要求改善待遇和争取工人民主权利的斗争。日本工人为对抗垄断资本尽量压低工资的政策，提出最低工资为八千日元，并且要求把它订为国家的法律。这个斗争如果能够取得胜利，资本家把工资压低到八千日元以下就成为非法行为，日本工人就能有力地为保卫自己的生活权利而斗争。
    这次春季斗争是在这样的背景下进行的：现在，日本工矿生产水平比战前增长了一点三倍，而工人生活却未超过战前水平。据日本大藏省的调查，战后十年间，日本企业的内外资金达十二万亿日元，比战前十年的五万亿日元多一点四倍。这都是从日本劳动人民身上榨取来的。据日本经济学家们的统计，从1946年到1953年，日本工人被榨取的剩余价值，累计达七万三千亿日元。日本垄断资本贪得无厌，一方面千方百计地迫使工人加强劳动强度，提高劳动效率；另一方面又尽量少用工人，压制工资的提高。拿1955年同1951年相比，工矿生产水平增长65％，劳动效率提高48％，而产业工人人数只增加11％，工资也只提高了22％。换句话说，日本的垄断资本家发了大财，而日本工人的生活却越来越苦了。
    战后十一年来，日本工人一直在为改善生活进行着英勇的斗争。今年的春季斗争规模，出乎日本政府和垄断资本的意料，显示了日本工人团结统一和顽强的战斗精神。3月11日，全国各地工人采取了统一行动。由于日本政府制定了“公共企业体等劳动关系法”和“国家公务员法”，被剥夺了罢工权的公共企业和机关工作人员，采取了请假和开大会的斗争方式。国营铁道工人用举行群众大会的方式停止了工作，使七十五列客车、三百四十六列货车停开。日本政府对铁路工人实行了暴力镇压。东京警视厅派出三千五百名便衣警察，去阻止铁道工人的斗争。但国营铁道工会在预定时间以前，就举行了六小时的集会，使警察当局手足无措。这一天，电信电话员一万五千人、邮递员六千人开展了请假斗争。全国教员工会五十多万会员也一齐提前下课，分别在八千五百多处举行集会。
    特别是私营铁道工会和煤炭工会采取了统一行动，壮大了斗争的声势。私营铁道工会打破十年来的常规，改变了一贯采用的假日罢工的战术，参加了统一罢工的斗争。煤矿工人改变了过去各矿不能统一罢工的情况，今年统一了行动。他们从3月4日开始拒绝加班加点，7日罢工四十八小时，11日开始七十二小时罢工，并决定从16日开始举行无限期罢工。这一强有力的行动，迫使资本家较快地接受了增加月薪一千三百元的条件。
    在统一斗争中，各企业工人互相支援，发挥了团结友爱的精神。九州门司国营铁路工人举行职工大会的时候，正在罢工的六千名煤矿工人就前往支援。大牟田三池炭矿工人举行七十二小时罢工时，国营铁路工人在该矿专用线上拒绝卸货。有些车站站长经过工会说服解释，拒绝了警察的干涉。在岩手县，有二千五百多名教员家属，参加了教职员大会。
    在大企业工人的带动下，各地中小企业工人，同样展开了英勇的斗争。大阪野村制作所工会（会员一百一十七人），为争取增加工资，发动了无限期的罢工。他们在罢工中举行了工人代表会，热烈地讨论了最低工资制的问题。美军基地的工人也卷入斗争。立川基地的女工罢工时，得到基地工会的支持。
    日本工人的合理要求，还得到广大农民的同情。砂川町军事基地的六十名居民代表，特意乘大汽车到日本工会总评议会、东京地方工会、国营铁道工会和煤炭工会访问，表示热烈支持。
    在这次斗争中，临时工开始了有组织的行动。二次大战以后，垄断资本家为赚更多的钱，尽量雇用临时工人。例如在化学工业中，临时工约占工人总数的14％，中小金属矿山的临时工则达到25.6％。临时工的工资只有固定工人工资的一半左右。1956年固定工人平均每日工资是五百二十七日元，而临时工平均一天只能拿到三百八十一日元。大量的临时工不能享受劳保福利，而且劳动条件十分恶劣。他们为了争取转入正式工人，还得拚命地干活。资本家大量雇用临时工，还有着分裂工人运动的政治目的，因为临时工没有工会组织。今年3月初，五百名临时工代表在东京集会，和强大的工会代表交流了斗争经验。会议中讨论了组织问题，决定成立临时工地方协议会和全国临时工协议会，为有组织地争取生活权利而斗争。这个大会标志着日本工人运动的新发展。
    日本政府和垄断资本对工人的斗争采取了警察行动和欺骗手段。为挽救燃料缺乏和运输力不足的危机，他们较快地向煤炭工人、铁道工人作了某些妥协。在强大的工会组织取得初步胜利之后，资产阶级报纸就大肆宣传“春季斗争已经结束”，以破坏工人的统一行动，削弱全国工人的斗争。而某些工会组织，也未能坚持原订的“实力斗争”计划，以致为制订最低工资制而进行的斗争缺乏足够的力量。现在，这一斗争还在继续，但正如日本“赤旗报”所指出的，为扩大春季斗争的胜利，日本工人还需要加强团结，把斗争向前推进一步。（附图片）
