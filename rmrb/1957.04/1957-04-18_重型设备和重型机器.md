Industrial Common Sense

    Large-scale production equipment such as iron-smelting blast furnaces, steel-making converters, oil refining fractionation towers, and shipbuilding docks are usually called heavy equipment. Rolling mills in steel plants, various engines and generators in power plants, forging presses in automobile factories, and machine tools that manufacture various heavy equipment are all called heavy machinery. Sometimes heavy equipment and heavy machinery are collectively referred to as heavy equipment.
    Heavy equipment itself is large, heavy, and complex in structure. Under normal circumstances, not many are needed at the same time, and they often cannot be mass-produced. Being large and heavy makes operation extremely laborious, which requires a high degree of mechanized, automated, or semi-automated operation. Due to these two characteristics, the manufacturing cost of this type of equipment is relatively high.
    However, this equipment is the backbone of industry and an important condition for a country to achieve industrialization. Without them, it is impossible to smelt large amounts of iron and steel, to manufacture large numbers of machines, to manufacture train locomotives and giant ships, and there can be no independent defense industry.

    重型设备和重型机器
    炼铁的高炉、炼钢的转炉、炼油的分馏塔、造船的船坞设置等大型的生产设备，通常都叫做重型设备。轧钢厂的轧钢机、发电厂里的各种发动机和发电机、汽车厂里的锻压机以及制造各种重型设备的工作母机，都叫做重型机器。有时候也把重型设备和重型机器统称为重型设备的。
    重型设备本身都庞大沉重，构造复杂繁重，在一般情况下，在同一时间需要都不多，常常不能成批生产。庞大沉重，操作起来极其费力，因而就要求高度机械化自动化或半自动化操作。由于这两个特点，这种设备制造的费用比较大。
    但这些设备是工业中的骨干，是一个国家实现工业化所必具的重要条件。没有它们就不能冶炼出大量的钢铁，就不能制造大批的机器，就不能制造出火车机车和巨型轮船，也不可能有独立的国防工业。
