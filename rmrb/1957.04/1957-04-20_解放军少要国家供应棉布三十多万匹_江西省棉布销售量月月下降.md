Xinhua News Agency, 19th—The People's Liberation Army military supply production departments are taking various measures to conserve military-use cotton cloth and cotton.

This year, the direct supply method has been adopted for the cotton cloth needed by various military uniform factories. Because the material turnover is accelerated and the cotton cloth reserve quantity is compressed, the state can reduce the supply by 343,000 bolts of cotton cloth. The military supply production department also decided to use all of the more than 53,000 bolts of substandard cloth that have been backlogged in the warehouse for a long time to make clothing. After research by technicians, the use of these substandard cloths does not affect the requirements for the product to be strong, suitable, light, and beautiful. The military supply production departments also require all subordinate factories to use as little or no public cloth as possible.

Improving the cutting method of clothing and increasing the utilization rate of cotton cloth, after the implementation of this measure, each clothing factory can save more than 16,000 bolts of cotton cloth throughout the year. Clothing technicians have also strengthened the preparation and finishing processes, requiring accurate arrangement of cloth widths to fully utilize the width of the cloth. It is expected that the loss of cotton cloth can be reduced by more than 6,000 bolts this year. Cotton cloth scraps that were previously treated as waste will also be utilized as much as possible.

The military supply production department decided that, without affecting the principle of warmth, a portion of recycled old cotton will be mixed into the wadding of winter clothing for the troops this year. This measure has been implemented in all clothing factories throughout the army. All unusable waste cloth scraps will also be processed by each clothing factory into recycled cotton and mixed into cotton clothes and cotton quilts. These measures can save the country a total of 87,000 dan of new cotton.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 19th—A good atmosphere of saving cloth is gradually forming in Jiangxi Province. In the past, the people's police in Jiangxi Province issued a set of cotton clothes every year, which were handed in after one year of use. After many people's police learned about the tight supply of cotton cloth in the country, they voluntarily requested to extend the use time. Now, the Jiangxi Provincial Public Security Department has issued a notice that the cotton clothes issued last year will be worn for another year, and each person will wash and dry them for safekeeping, which can save more than 100,000 chi of cotton cloth. The workers of the Zhongjiashan Coal Mine put forward the method of "wash when dirty, dry when wet, mend when broken, and each person takes good care of it" in the use of work clothes, which extended the use time of work clothes, and it is no longer necessary to issue two sets of work clothes every year. After the Nanchang Grain Department improved the recycling of flour bags, it can save 624,000 chi of cotton cloth throughout the year.

Since the beginning of this year, the sales volume of cotton cloth in Jiangxi Province has been declining month by month. According to the statistics of Jiangxi Provincial Textile Company, it decreased by 40.18% in February compared with January, and by another 8.35% in March compared with February.

    解放军少要国家供应棉布三十多万匹
    江西省棉布销售量月月下降
    新华社19日讯　中国人民解放军军需生产部门正在采取各种措施节约军用的棉布、棉花。
    今年对各军需被服工厂所需要的棉布采取了直接供应的办法，因为物资周转加快，棉布储备数量压缩，就可以少要国家供应三十四万三千匹棉布。军需生产部门还决定把长期积压在仓库中的五万三千多匹次布全部用来制作被服。经过技术人员的研究，利用这些次布并不影响产品坚固、适用、轻便、美观的要求。军需生产部门还要求所属各工厂尽量少用或不用公用布。
    改进服装的剪裁方法，增加棉布的利用率，这一措施实行以后，各被服工厂全年可以节约棉布一万六千多匹。被服技术人员还加强了准备整理工序，要求准确地排配布幅，以充分利用布的幅度，预计今年棉布的损耗可以减少六千多匹。过去当作废料处理的棉布碎料，也将尽量加以利用。
    军需生产部门决定在不影响保暖的原则下，今年部队冬季被服的絮棉掺用一部分回收的旧棉花。这一措施已经在全军各被服工厂实行。所有不能利用的废布渣，也要由各被服工厂加工弹成再生棉掺在棉服、棉被中使用。这些措施共可为国家节约新棉花八万七千担。
    新华社南昌19日电　节约用布的良好风尚，正在江西省逐渐形成。江西省的人民警察，过去每年发一套棉衣，使用一年后即行上缴，许多人民警察了解到国家棉布供应紧张的情况以后，就自动提出延长使用时间的要求。现在江西省公安厅已经发出通知，去年发的棉衣再多穿一年，由各人洗刷晒干，自行保管，这样可节约棉布十多万尺。钟家山煤矿工人在使用工作服方面，提出了“脏了就洗，湿了就晒，破了就补，各人管好”的办法，延长了工作服的使用时间，用不着每年发两套工作服了。南昌市粮食部门改进面粉袋的回收工作后，全年可以节约棉布六十二万四千尺。
    今年以来，江西省棉布销售量已跟着月月下降。据江西省纺织品公司统计，2月份比1月份下降40.18％，3月份又比2月份下降8.35％。
