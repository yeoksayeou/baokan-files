How is the pre-distribution work for minor spring crops being prepared?
The CCP Rui'an County Committee
Strengthening Specific Leadership of the Pre-Distribution Work

(According to this newspaper) "Li Xia" (Start of Summer) is approaching, and early-maturing spring coarse grains will be harvested in only about twenty days. The pre-distribution of spring harvests by agricultural cooperatives has become an urgent and important task at present. To strengthen leadership over the pre-distribution work of spring harvests by agricultural cooperatives, the CCP Rui'an County Committee of Zhejiang Province convened a meeting at the end of March for resident cadres of twelve cooperatives, including Longshan and Shannan, and accounting instructors from various districts. The meeting specifically studied several specific policies in the pre-distribution of spring harvests and the final account of some agricultural cooperatives' distributions last year.

To prepare for this meeting, the county committee sent cadres to five agricultural cooperatives, including Wufang and Shilin, for investigation and reconnaissance. Based on the different regions and the types of cooperatives with different increases or decreases in production, they initially proposed the principles to be followed in pre-distribution and the handling of specific policy issues.

During the discussion, it was unanimously agreed that the principle of this year's pre-distribution of spring harvests should be to grasp the spirit of "public first, private second" and "consideration for both public and private interests," to reasonably reserve sufficient funds within the cooperative for next season's production, to pre-distribute according to workdays, and to appropriately take care of households in difficulty. The meeting specifically studied how cooperatives with different increases and decreases in production should grasp this principle in pre-distribution. Regarding other specific policy issues in pre-distribution, the meeting believed that it is necessary to adhere to the CCP Central Committee's notice on the three measures for running cooperatives democratically, to ensure fiscal transparency, and to submit it to the members for discussion, consultation, and approval, and not to subjectively monopolize it. In particular, for those agricultural cooperatives with outstanding final accounts from last year's distribution, it is even more necessary to do a good job of "making finances public" to eliminate members' doubts. This should be used as a driving force to promote the current spring plowing and production and to prepare for the pre-distribution work of spring harvests.

The meeting also studied how to ensure that production and distribution are not delayed in the pre-distribution work of spring harvests.

    小春作物预分工作准备得怎样了？
    中共瑞安县委员会
    加强预分工作的具体领导
    本报讯　“立夏”将到，早熟春杂粮只有二十来天就要收割了。农业社的春花预分已成为当前刻不容缓的一项重要工作。中共浙江省瑞安县委为加强对农业社的春花预分工作的领导，在3月底召开了隆山、山南等十二个社的驻社干部及各区会计辅导员会议，专门研究了春花预分中的若干具体政策和部分农业社的去年分配决算等问题。
    为了开好这个会议，县委在会前派干部分别到五方、石林等五个农业社，作了调查摸底；并根据不同地区、不同增减产程度的类型社，初步提出了预分中应掌握的原则及对若干具体政策问题的处理意见。
    在讨论中，一致认为今年春花预分的原则，应该是掌握“先公后私”“公私兼顾”的精神，合理留足社内下季生产资金，按劳动日预分，适当照顾困难户。会议具体研究了不同增产、减产情况的合作社在预分中如何掌握这一原则的问题。对预分中其他若干具体政策问题，会议认为必须坚持中共中央发出的关于民主办社三项措施的通知，做到财政公开，并交社员讨论、协商、通过，不得主观包办；特别是对于去年分配决算未清的部分农业社，更须做好“公开财政”工作，消除社员怀疑。以此作为推动当前春耕生产的动力，并为春花预分工作做好准备。
    会议还研究了春花预分工作中生产、分配两不误的做法。
