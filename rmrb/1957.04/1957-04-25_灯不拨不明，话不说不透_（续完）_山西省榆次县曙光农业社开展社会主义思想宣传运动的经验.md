"A lamp will not shine unless it is adjusted, words will not be clear unless they are spoken" (continued)
The experience of the Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative in Yuci County, Shanxi Province, in carrying out the socialist ideological education movement
Wang Chengwang, Secretary of the Yuci Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

We cannot close our eyes and say that workers' lives are good and farmers' lives are hard.

Regarding the issue of workers' lives: Someone who used to be a temporary worker at the "Jingwei" factory said, "You are envious when you hear that workers earn tens of yuan a month, but you only see the fish drinking water and not the gills leaking. You don't know that their expenses are also high! The temporary workers at 'Jingwei' earn 31 yuan for level one, 39 yuan for level two, and 45 yuan for level three. The average worker in the factory doesn't even reach level three. Let's take level three as an example: 45 yuan a month, 3 yuan for rent, 0.5 yuan for burning soil, water and electricity bills, and garbage disposal also cost money. Including food, it costs 10 yuan per person per month. For a family of four, that's 40 yuan. That leaves 60 yuan a year. What about clothes?" A farmer with a family of four also calculated his expenses: last year, 240 workdays earned 240 yuan. 1,800 jin of rations were distributed, deducting 140 yuan, leaving 100 yuan. Kerosene cost 4 yuan, burning coal cost 24 yuan. After deducting salt, matches, and vinegar, there's still 50 or 60 yuan left. He said, "I haven't gone without clothes either!" Someone said, "Many of the workers at the Jingwei factory are from Shanghai and Guangzhou. If they come to our small place and earn less, who would come? More is acceptable." Someone said, "Also, their technology is higher. Our cooperative bought a car and hired a worker for 70 yuan a month. Could you drive it if we gave you 100 yuan?" Someone said, "We can't do technical work, but we can pull carts and do odd jobs. Their wages are also not low!" Someone said, "Didn't you hear the report saying that the wages for pulling carts are high because there was some bias in the work? You try it now and see if you can still earn that much. The rubber-wheeled carts in Huai Ren have also stopped." Someone said, "The wages for odd jobs are high, a little high. The government is considering this issue." Someone said, "The wages for odd jobs can't be reduced to less than the farmers' wages. Didn't you see that last year, no one wanted to go when you called?" Someone said, "Anyway, we can't close our eyes and say that workers' lives are good and farmers' lives are hard. According to the principle of 'to each according to his work,' whoever has more labor and fewer people will live well. Conversely, whoever has more people and less labor will have more difficulties. Aren't workers and cadres also advocating birth control? If life is difficult, workers' children also have to be given away." Someone said, "Saying that their labor is light and their conditions are good, they have a seven-day week, and when we rest, we even stay at home. Didn't someone from our village just come back from Fujiabao? Ask him if the workers' labor is light and the conditions are good. If it's good, why did he come back? Every profession is like a mountain, you can't read that family letter or recognize those family characters." Someone said, "The income of farmers and workers can't be compared. If the agricultural cooperative produces well, it will distribute more. If production decreases, it will distribute less. We can't let the workers follow the farmers! For example, last year our production decreased and we distributed 1.2 yuan per workday. This year's plan is 2.4 yuan. If we follow the normal year of the previous year, we would still distribute 1.7 yuan. We can't just compare it to the time when production decreases! Moreover, villages are different from each other. Some are worse than us, and some are higher than us. In Dongzhao, one workday is distributed more than 3 yuan. Who should we compare with? If we were in charge, we couldn't make a decision on how much wages to give to the workers. All aspects of the situation have to be considered!"

When they calculated several households face-to-face, every family had enough grain to eat, and they all smiled.

Another group discussed lowering workers' wages. Some advocated halving them, some advocated 80%, and some advocated 90%. After discussing for a long time, the conclusion was that it couldn't be lowered. Someone said, "If the workers' wages are less than the farmers', they won't work, and no farmers will want to go either. If that happens, do we still want industry or not?" A young person said, "No." An old person said, "Young people, you're just talking idly and not thinking carefully. For example, if the workers at the Jinhua Textile Factory don't work, we can't spin yarn or weave cloth. I think you'll be walking around with your butts exposed! " Some people said: "It can't be lowered. If they don't want to work and return to the countryside, won't adding more people mean we have to divide ours equally? Is that lowering our income or lowering the workers' income?" Someone said, "You're always selfish and self-centered. Everyone does their own work. If they work, they can produce. Are they dividing yours?" Someone said, "Don't say that! Haven't you read the newspapers? When Britain and France invaded Egypt, the Soviet Union said it would send troops, and they were so scared they didn't dare to fight! Is it okay to not have industry? We haven't suffered enough as slaves. The Japanese just left a few years ago. Have you forgotten how they bullied us?" Regarding the grain and cloth coupon issues: At the beginning, this person said 380 jin wasn't enough, that person said 600 jin wasn't enough, and another young person said 1,000 jin wasn't enough for him to eat. Another person got angry and said, "We're discussing problems, but you're always talking nonsense. Who here has 380 jin? Except for the five-guarantee households, who doesn't have more than 400 jin? Let's calculate. Which family doesn't have enough grain to eat before the summer harvest?" They calculated several households face-to-face, and every family had enough to eat, and they all smiled. Some said, "Don't laugh. We'll have enough to eat until summer, but it's like this every year. We eat wheat after harvesting wheat, and we eat autumn crops after harvesting autumn crops. We can't turn it around. There's no way. Which family can turn it around?" Someone else said, "Out of the 400 jin, 30 jin of beans are for oil. Either the state provides oil, or there's not enough grain to eat. Our place is different from others. Oil is beans, and grain is also beans. If the state doesn't leave us some oilseeds to mix in with the grain, it won't work!" Someone said, "I heard that our country only has an average of 600 jin of grain per person, including seeds, oil, liquor, and feed. How much do you think we can eat? If we eat too much, we'll starve others. Anyway, there's only that much grain. If we don't think of ways to increase production, no one will have a good solution." Some retorted, "If we have to reduce, everyone should reduce. Why do workers eat more?" Someone said, "You only heard that they eat 60 jin, which is the most. Even if it's the most, it's still that much per adult. The grain supply in the city is different from ours. We average it for adults and children, while they have different amounts for adults and children, and for light and heavy labor."

One group calculated on the spot for the cadre stationed in the cooperative, the deputy secretary of the Yuci County Committee of the Communist Youth League. This comrade's family of four, all in the city, two adults and two children, are supplied with 85 jin per month, equivalent to 110 jin of coarse grains, or 1,320 jin per year, averaging 330 jin per person. The five-guarantee households in Zhangqing Village still average 380 jin. After this calculation, everyone stopped making noise. Someone remembered and said that workers eat well, white flour and rice. Aren't our farmers' mouths mouths too? Someone said, "You be the head of the household and think about what to do? Jinan is a wheat-producing area. Farmers there eat noodles three times a day. If farmers from there come out and eat more than ten jin of noodles a month, do you think there will be complaints? Don't just look at our Zhangqing Village. Workers aren't just from one village. Take rice, for example. People from Shanghai and Guangdong at 'Jingwei' just love to eat rice. They're not used to eating white flour. We think rice is good, but it's not as good as white flour, but they insist on eating rice and don't like eating white flour. Every place has its own customs. If you were the head of the household, what would you do?" Someone said, "We don't have any opinions about grain. Let's talk about cloth coupons. Who wastes cloth?" Someone answered, "Haven't you heard the working comrades say that if farmers have too many cloth coupons, they won't be able to afford them?" Someone said, "You say Zhangqing who can't afford them?" Someone said, "Is the world only Zhangqing? There are many places that are worse than our village! Even two zhang of cloth, there are people who can't afford it." Someone said, "If they can't afford it, it's because they have less money. Can all workers afford it?" Someone said, "Didn't you hear the report? Cadres and workers are only more than 20 million people. Farmers are 500 million. If you subtract them, I don't think you'll get even a few inches."

Can the prices of industrial products be reduced? Can the prices of agricultural products be raised?

Regarding the price issue: Originally, everyone's emotions were very high, and they always felt they were losing too much, but the issue was basically resolved in the discussion. Someone said: "If we raise the price of grain, what will happen if other prices rise as well? The result will be the same as not raising it, so don't propose this idea." Some people said: "You said that the prices of industrial products have all gone up, but why hasn't the price of grain risen? The price is still controlled by the state." Someone said: "You have to eat grain to do anything. If the price of grain rises, do you think it will rise or not? If it doesn't rise, the state will have to reduce its income." Someone said: "It's fine if the prices of industrial products are reduced. It's fine if the price of grain doesn't rise." Someone said: "The prices of industrial products are all state-owned. The state makes money, and the state loses money. They earn money here and lose money there. Haven't you heard that our tractor station is losing money? If we don't earn some money, where will we get the money to make up for the losing business?" Someone said: "Our village also has a weather station and a middle school. Isn't that all paid for by the state?" Someone said: "That makes sense. I heard that it costs tens of thousands of yuan to connect wired broadcasting and telephones from the city to our village. If you don't earn some money, will they connect it for you for free and let you listen to the radio?" Someone said: "What is the burden (agricultural tax) for?" Someone said: "The same, the burden is also state income, earning money is also state income, just the burden is enough, Zhangqing's burden is not enough for our village expenses, don't build factories?" Someone said: "I think this method (some prices are more expensive) is better than increasing the burden. Whoever buys something bears the burden. If you want to drink alcohol, you should bear more of the burden. Don't say one yuan per jin, two yuan per jin is not expensive." However, everyone believes that the situation where management is poor, resulting in excessively high costs, and that many goods in the free market do not have market prices and are arbitrarily increased by sellers should be improved.

3. Summarize on the basis of "arguing through"

"The ice that was frozen in my belly in the past has now been melted away!"

In this way, in the group, you say a word, I say a word, and basically it is argued through. Based on this, a summary was made.

The general idea of ​​the summary is this: Reasonable and feasible opinions can be accepted and tell everyone that they can be considered, changed, or reported to higher authorities. Such as: the operation and labor issues of supply and marketing cooperatives and handicraft cooperatives, the management and operation issues of factories, the amount of oilseeds to be retained, the issue of concentrating grain processing industries in cities, the management of rural carts, bicycles, and manure carts in cities, and the issue of price management. Some of the issues raised by farmers that were caused by a lack of understanding of the overall situation, or a lack of understanding of the significance of certain specific policies, were explained. Such as: the price of industrial products, the urban grain supply, workers' wages, and cloth coupon issues. Some requirements cannot be resolved now, and some requirements cannot be resolved even in the socialist stage, so explain them clearly. Problems that cannot be resolved now include: labor insurance and welfare, and difficulties in life due to large populations. Problems that cannot be resolved in the socialist stage include: the difference between urban and rural areas, the difference between physical and mental labor; and during the period of remuneration according to work, the difference between being a little richer and being relatively not rich. Incorrect opinions should be criticized. For example, some require completely the same labor conditions, and some require absolute equalization of living conditions. What is difficult to handle is: the elderly require prohibiting young people from entering the city; young people require prohibiting young women from marrying into the city. Explain the marriage policy to everyone and say that measures can be taken to restrict the flow of young people into cities to avoid blindness, and the Communist Youth League and the Women's Federation will do some work in this regard in the future. Try to solve practical problems. The farmers said that the distribution was unfair; the cadres said that the fundamental problem was that there were too few things, and that unfairness existed, but it was not the main or fundamental problem. The same is true for grain, cloth, and other issues. Although the marriage issue has not been resolved well, the ideological issue has also been resolved. The masses' enthusiasm is high, saying: "A lamp will not shine unless it is adjusted, words will not be clear unless they are spoken." "It's a pleasure to speak clearly." "The ice that was frozen in my belly in the past has now been melted away!" "This is called expanding democratic life. In the future, when there are problems, we will bring them up face-to-face. Everyone is a saint."

This movement was carried out using half a month of evening time, and it was basically successful. It educated the peasants and also improved the cadres (in the past, cadres either suppressed the opinions of the masses or dared not confront them), greatly promoted the current production activities, and the feelings between the members and the cadres also became closer.

    “灯不拨不明，话不说不透”（续完）
    山西省榆次县曙光农业社开展社会主义思想宣传运动的经验
    中共榆次地委书记　王成旺
    不能闭着眼睛说工人生活就是好，农民生活就是苦
    关于工人生活问题：有个在“经纬”厂做过临时工的人说：“你们听见工人一个月赚几十元就眼红，这才是只见鱼喝水，不见两鳃漏，你们就不知道他们开支也大啊！‘经纬’的临时工一级工三十一元，二级工三十九元，三级工四十五元。全厂工人还平均不到三级。就以三级算吧：每月四十五元，房租三元，烧土五角，水费，电费，倒灰渣，还得出钱，连吃在内一个人一月总得十元，一家四口，四十元，一年剩下六十元，不穿啦？”一个一家四口人的农民也算了算他的：去年二百个劳动日，收入二百四十元，口粮分了一千八百斤，扣一百四十元，下余一百元，煤油四元，烧煤二十四元，除了吃盐、买火柴、打醋，也是留下五、六十元。他说“我也没打穿衣服呀！”有人说：“经纬厂工人上海、广州人多，从那里来咱这小地方，收入少了谁来，多点可以。”有人说：还有，人家技术高，咱社买了一辆汽车，雇工人一月七十元，给你一百元你能开了？有人说：技术活咱干不了，拉平车、做杂工总行，这些人工资也不低啊！有人说：你没听报告，说拉平车工资高，是工作上出了点偏向，你现在去试试，看还能赚上赚不上？怀仁的胶皮车还歇回来。杂工的工资高，是有点高，政府正考虑这个问题哩。有人说：杂工的工资也不能减的比农民少了，不见去年，调你们谁去谁也不去。有人说：反正不能闭着眼说工人生活就是好，农民生活就是苦。按劳取酬，这社会，谁的劳力多，人口少，谁就过得好，相反谁就过的困难些，工人干部不是也提倡避孕？生活困难了，工人的孩子也得给人。有人说：说人家劳动轻、条件好，人家是七天一个星期，咱休息起来连住歇。咱村有人不是刚从富家滩回来，问问他工人劳动轻不轻，条件好不好？好，他回来干啥？隔行如隔山，不念那家书不识那家字。有人说，农民和工人的收入也不好比，农业社生产干得好，就分得多，减产了就分得少，不能让人家工人跟上农民跑啊！比如去年咱们减产分的一元二，今年计划是两元四，如果按前年中常年景说，还分一元七，也不能光以减产时来比较啊！况且村和村还不一样，有的不如咱，有的比咱还高，东赵一个劳动日就分三元多，你说该和谁比呢？让咱当家，也下不了决心，究竟该给工人多少工资。各方面的情况都得考虑到啊！
    当面算了几户，家家的粮食够吃，都笑起来了
    另一个小组讨论的是要下工人的工资。有的主张下一半，有的主张八折，也有的主张九折。讨论半天总结是下不得。有人说：工人工资少了不如农民，人家不干，农民也没人愿去，像去年发生过的情况，那我们还要工业不要？有个青年人说：不要。一个老年人说：青年人，尽说风凉话，就不好好考虑考虑，比如晋华纺织厂工人不干，咱一不会纺花，二不会织布，我看你露着屁股怎么出门呀？有的人说：下不得，他们不愿干回来农村，添些人还不是要平分咱们的，那是下咱的收入呢，还是下工人的收入呢？有人说：你这家伙老是自私自利，各人干各人的，人家劳动人家就能生产，分着你的啦？有人说：不要说这啦！你们没看过报纸，英法侵略埃及，苏联一说出兵，就吓的他们不敢打啦，没工业行不行？亡国奴咱还没有当够，日本人才打走几年，倒忘了人家欺侮咱啦！关于粮食问题和布票问题：开始这个说三百八十斤不够，那个说六百斤也不够，还有个青年人说一千斤不够他吃。另一个人火了说：“讨论问题嘛，总是说二话，咱们谁是三百八十斤，除五保户三百八十斤以外，谁还不在四百斤以上，咱计算一下，谁家的粮食吃不到收夏。”挨住当面算了几户，家家够吃，都笑起来了。有的说：不要笑了，接夏天么，够吃了，可是年年这样，打下麦吃麦，打秋吃秋，倒不转，就没个办法，谁家能倒转了。又有人说：四百斤里边，有三十斤豆子是顶油，要不就是国家供油，要不就是粮食不够吃，咱这地方不比别处，油料就是豆，粮食也是豆，国家要不给咱留点油料，混在粮食里，可是不行啊！有的说：听说咱全国每人才平均六百斤粮食，种子、油、酒料、饲粮什么也在里头，你们说咱能吃多少，咱吃多了，饿了别人，反正就是那点儿粮食，不从生产上想办法增产，谁也没有好办法。有的反驳，要少就都少，工人为什么吃的多？有人说：你光听说他们吃六十斤，那是最多的，就以最多的说，他也是一个大人分那么多，城里人粮食供应和咱不一样，咱是大小人平均，人家是大小人、劳动轻重都不同。
    一个组，当场替驻社干部、青年团榆次县委副书记算了一下，这个同志一家四口人，都在城里，夫妇两个大人，两个孩子，每月供应八十五斤，折粗粮一百一十斤，全年一千三百二十斤，平均每人三百三十斤。张庆村五保户还平均三百八十斤。这样一算，大家不哼气了。有人又想起来说工人吃的好，白面大米，咱们农民的嘴就不是嘴？有人说：你来当个家，想想该怎么办？晋南是产麦区，农民一天三顿面，人家的农民出来，一月吃上十几斤面，你说有意见没有？你不要光看咱张庆村，工人又不是一个村的人。就拿大米来说：“经纬”的上海、广东人，就是爱吃大米，白面还吃不惯呢。咱们觉得大米好，但是总不如白面好，可是他非吃大米不行，就不爱吃白面。一处乡土，一处风俗，你当这个当家人，我看你怎么办啊！有人说：粮食咱们没意见了，咱们说布票问题吧。到底是谁费布？有人回答说：你过去没听工作同志讲过，给农民布票多了，你也买不起。有人说：你说张庆谁家买不起？有人说：天下光咱张庆？不如咱村的地方多呢！两丈布就是还有买不起的。有人说：买不起是他钱少，工人就都能买起了？有人说：你没听报告，干部和工人不过两千多万人，农民有五亿，你把他们减了，我看你也分不到几寸。
    工业品价格能不能减？农产品价格能不能提？
    关于物价问题：原来大家的情绪很大，总觉得吃亏太大，但讨论中也基本上解决了这个问题。有人说：提高粮价，别的都提起来怎么办？结果还是和不提一样，可不要提这个意见。有的说：你说的工业品价格都提了，粮价怎么也没跟上涨起来，价格还不是由国家掌握。有人说：做什也得吃粮，粮价涨了，你说他涨不涨，不涨国家就要减少收入。有人说：工业品价格降降就行，粮价不涨也行。有人说：工业品贵贱都是国家的，赚也是国家，赔也是国家，这里赚，那里赔。你没听说，咱们拖拉机站就赔钱，要不赚上些，从那里来补赔钱买卖？有的说：咱村还有气象站，还有中学哩，那都不是国家花钱？有的说：这话有道理，听说从城里往咱村接有线广播和电话，就得几万元钱，不赚上些能给你白接起来，叫你听广播？有的说：那负担（农业税）干了甚啦？有的说：一样，负担也是国家收入，赚下钱也是国家收入，光负担够甚，咱张庆的负担，还不够咱村开支，不要建设工厂啦？有的说：我看这办法（一部分物价贵一些）比增加负担强，这是谁买东西谁负担。你要喝酒，就让你多负担些，别说一元钱一斤，两元钱一斤也不贵。但是，对因为管理不善造成成本过高，和自由市场上许多种物品没有市价，由卖的人乱涨的情况，大家都认为应该改善。
    三、在“吵通”的基础上作总结
    “过去肚里结的一块冰，现在给冲消啦！”
    就这样在小组里，你一言，我一语，基本上吵通了。在这个基础上做了总结。
    总结的大意是这样：合理的、能办到的意见，可以接受，告诉大家说可以考虑、改变，或向上级反映。如：供销社和手工业社的经营、劳动问题，工厂的管理经营问题，油料留量问题，粮食加工业集中城市的问题，城市里对农村大车、自行车、拉粪车的管理问题，物价管理问题，粮食压级问题。由于农民不了解全面情况，或不了解规定某些具体政策的意义，因而引起的糊涂思想和误解，就加以解释。如：工业品价格问题，城市粮食供应问题，工人工资问题，布票问题。有些要求现在不能解决，有些要求在社会主义阶段也不能解决，就说清楚。现在不能解决的问题有：劳保福利，人口多生活困难，富裕中农收入减少。社会主义阶段也不能解决的问题有：城市与乡村的差别，体力劳动与脑力劳动的差别；在按劳取酬时期，富裕一点和比较不富裕一点的差别。不对的意见要批评。比如有的要求劳动条件完全相同，有的要求生活条件绝对平均。难办的是：老年人要求禁止青年人进城；青年人要求禁止青年妇女嫁到城里。向大家解释婚姻政策，说对于青年流进城市可设法予以限制，以免盲目，并由青年团、妇联会今后在这方面做些工作。对实际问题设法加以解决。一切都归到生产上来。农民说分配不公；干部说根本问题是东西少，不公虽有，但不是主要的，也不是根本的。粮食，布等问题，都是如此。婚姻问题虽未解决得好，但思想问题也解决了。群众的情绪高涨，说：“灯不拨不明，话不说不透。”“说透了，就痛快啦。”“过去肚里结的一块冰，现在给冲消啦！”“这才叫扩大民主生活，以后有问题提到当面，众人是圣人。”
    这次运动是利用半个月的晚上的时间进行的，基本上是成功的，教育了农民，也提高了干部（过去干部对群众的意见不是压，就是不敢招架），大大推动了当前生产行动，社员们和干部的情感也亲密起来了。　（原载山西日报）
