Comrade Esteemed Chairman Voroshilov, esteemed Soviet guests, comrades, and friends:

Today, all sectors of the people of Beijing are holding a grand meeting here to welcome the representatives of our great ally, Comrade Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and other Soviet guests. We feel extremely honored and happy. First of all, please allow me, on behalf of all the people of Beijing, to extend a warm welcome to Comrade Esteemed Chairman Voroshilov and the Soviet guests. (Enthusiastic applause)

Comrade Voroshilov is one of the outstanding leaders of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet state, well-known and respected by the Chinese people. From the beginning of his revolutionary path in his youth, he devoted everything to the great cause of the working class and became a loyal student and comrade-in-arms of the great Lenin. He has held important positions in the Soviet Communist Party, the Soviet government, and the army, and with his infinite loyalty and outstanding talent for the cause of the proletarian revolution, he has made brilliant contributions to the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution, to strengthening the Soviet Union's defense capabilities, and to the magnificent cause of building socialism and communism. Comrade Voroshilov is also the closest comrade and friend of the Chinese people. This time, at the invitation of Chairman Mao Zedong, he came to our country from afar, bringing not only the profound friendship of the great Soviet people but also further strengthening the great unity between China and the Soviet Union. Let me take this opportunity, on behalf of the people of Beijing, to express our highest respect and heartfelt gratitude to our dear Comrade Voroshilov. (Stormy applause)

Under the leadership of the talented and brilliant revolutionary teacher Lenin and the Soviet Communist Party, the great Soviet people established the first socialist country in human history. Following the path opened up by the October Revolution, they overcame all kinds of extraordinary difficulties, transformed Russia from a backward agricultural country into an advanced socialist industrial country, turned the ideal of scientific socialism into a living reality, opened up the path of liberation for the proletariat and working people of the world, and set a brilliant example. At present, the Soviet people are confidently marching towards the most ideal society of modern mankind—communist society. After overfulfilling the Fifth Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy, the Soviet people are realizing the Sixth Five-Year Plan with unparalleled labor enthusiasm. In 1956, the Soviet Union's total industrial output value increased by about 11% compared to 1955, and more than thirty times compared to 1913. Agricultural production also achieved unprecedented bumper harvests, with grain harvests increasing by about 20% compared to 1955. There have also been leaps in scientific technology, cultural education, and other fields. At present, many scientific research departments in the Soviet Union have reached the most advanced levels in the world. With the rapid growth of production, the material and cultural life of the Soviet people is also constantly improving. Not long ago, I and the delegation of the National People's Congress and the delegation of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee visited the Soviet Union and personally witnessed the outstanding achievements and moving scenes of the Soviet people. Every comrade in our two delegations was delighted and encouraged by the creative labor of the Soviet people and the brilliant achievements they have achieved. The great achievements of the Soviet people over the past forty years have indisputably demonstrated the superiority of the socialist system. (Applause)

Internationally, the Soviet Union has also made great contributions to safeguarding world peace and the cause of human progress. The Soviet people have consistently sympathized with and supported the struggles of oppressed people against colonialism, for national independence, and for social liberation. Furthermore, in the Second World War, they defeated the fascist aggressors, saving humanity from fascist enslavement. The Soviet Union has consistently advocated that countries with different systems should coexist peacefully and has made unremitting efforts to ease international tensions. The Soviet Union is a strong fortress of world peace. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is the fundamental guarantee for maintaining world peace and developing the cause of human progress. The people of China and the Soviet Union are the closest comrades-in-arms and the most reliable comrades. Our two peoples will always work together with all peace-loving countries and people around the world to make the greatest efforts to maintain lasting world peace and the cause of human progress. (Enthusiastic applause)

The great achievements of the Soviet people in building socialist and communist society and safeguarding world peace have powerfully encouraged the struggle of progressive humanity around the world for peace, democracy, and socialism. The Chinese people have learned many valuable things from the rich experience of the Soviet people in revolution and socialist construction, and we will continue to strengthen our learning of the various advanced experiences of the Soviet Union in the future. (Enthusiastic applause)

The Soviet people have consistently sympathized with and supported the revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people and have provided comprehensive and enormous assistance to our socialist construction. The flowers of Sino-Soviet friendship are blooming all over the vast land of our two countries. The people of Beijing, like all the people of China, are delighted and encouraged by these blooming flowers of friendship. We will also never forget the warm welcome and cordial reception given to the delegation of our government headed by Premier Zhou Enlai, the delegation of the National People's Congress, and the delegations of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee when they visited the Soviet Union. The people of Beijing and all the people of China will always cherish the profound friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, which is as deep as that between brothers, and sincerely thank the Soviet people for their fraternal and enormous assistance to our country. We also ask Comrade Voroshilov and other Soviet comrades to convey the sincere friendship of our Chinese people to the fraternal Soviet people. (Prolonged applause)

Finally, let me once again express a warm welcome to Comrade Voroshilov and other Soviet comrades, and hope that in the course of your visit and our interactions, you will give us criticism and correction of the shortcomings and errors in our work. (Enthusiastic applause)

Long live the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union! (Enthusiastic applause)

Long live the great unity of the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union!
Long live world peace! (The entire audience stands up and applauds enthusiastically, shouting: Long live!)

    彭真市长的讲话敬爱的伏罗希洛夫主席同志，敬爱的苏联贵宾们，同志们、朋友们：
    今天我们北京市各界人民在这里举行大会欢迎我们伟大盟邦的代表、苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫同志和其他苏联贵宾们，我们感到十分荣幸，十分高兴。首先请允许我代表北京市全体人民向敬爱的伏罗希洛夫主席同志和苏联贵宾们表示热烈的欢迎。（热烈鼓掌）
    伏罗希洛夫同志是中国人民很熟悉和敬爱的苏联共产党和苏维埃国家杰出的领导人之一。他从青年时代踏上革命的道路开始，就把他的一切贡献给工人阶级的伟大事业，并且成为伟大的列宁的忠实学生和战友。他历任苏联共产党、苏联政府和军队的重要职务，并且以他对无产阶级革命事业的无限忠心和卓越的才干，为伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利，为增强苏联的国防力量和建设社会主义、共产主义的宏伟事业作出了光辉的贡献。伏罗希洛夫同志也是中国人民最亲密的同志和朋友。他这次应毛泽东主席的邀请不远万里来到我国访问，不仅给我们带来了伟大的苏联人民的深厚友情，而且将进一步加强中苏两国的伟大团结。让我借此机会代表北京市人民，向我们亲爱的伏罗希洛夫同志表示崇高的敬意和衷心的感谢。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    伟大的苏联人民在天才的英明的革命导师列宁和苏联共产党的领导下，建立了人类历史上第一个社会主义国家，沿着十月革命开辟的道路，战胜了各种异乎寻常的困难，把俄国从落后的农业国变为先进的社会主义工业国，把科学的社会主义理想变成了活生生的现实，给全世界无产阶级和劳动人民开辟了解放的道路，树立了光辉的榜样。目前苏联人民正在满怀信心地向着现代人类最理想的社会——共产主义社会迈进。苏联人民在超额完成了第五个发展国民经济的五年计划以后，正在以无比的劳动热情实现着第六个五年计划。1956年，苏联的工业生产总值比1955年增加了约11％。比1913年增加了三十倍以上。农业生产也获得了空前的大丰收，谷物的收获量比1955年增加了约20％。在科学技术和文化教育等各个方面也有了飞跃的发展，目前苏联的许多科学研究部门已经达到世界上最先进的水平。随着生产的迅速增长，苏联人民的物质生活和文化生活也在不断地提高。不久以前，我和全国人民代表大会代表团和北京市人民委员会代表团在苏联进行了访问，亲眼看到了苏联人民的各种卓越的成就和动人的情景。我们两个代表团的每个同志，都为苏联人民创造性的劳动和他们所获得的光辉成就而欢欣鼓舞。苏联人民四十年来的伟大成就，无可争辩地显示了社会主义制度的优越性。（鼓掌）
    在国际上，苏联为维护世界和平和人类进步事业也作出了伟大的贡献。苏联人民一贯地同情和支持被压迫人民为反对殖民主义、争取民族独立、争取社会解放而进行的斗争。并且在第二次世界大战中，打败了法西斯侵略者，使人类免于法西斯的奴役。苏联一贯主张不同制度国家应该和平共处，并且为和缓国际紧张局势进行坚持不懈的努力。苏联是世界和平的坚强堡垒。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，是维护世界和平和发展人类进步事业的基本保障。中苏两国人民是最亲密的战友和最可靠的同志，我们两国人民将永远同全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民一起，共同为维护世界持久和平和人类的进步事业尽最大的努力。（热烈鼓掌）
    苏联人民在建设社会主义、共产主义社会和维护世界和平中所取得的巨大成就，有力地鼓舞着全世界的进步人类为和平、民主和社会主义事业所进行的斗争。中国人民从苏联人民的革命和社会主义建设的丰富经验中学到了许多宝贵的东西，我们今后还要继续加强学习苏联的各种先进经验。（热烈鼓掌）
    苏联人民一贯地同情和支持中国人民的革命斗争，并且对于我国的社会主义建设事业给予了全面的巨大的援助。中苏友谊的花朵，开遍在我们两国广阔的土地上。我们北京市人民同全中国人民一样都为这些怒放的友谊花朵感到欢欣鼓舞。我们也永远忘不了以周恩来总理为首的我国政府代表团和全国人民代表大会代表团和北京市人民委员会等代表团访问苏联的时候，所受到的热烈欢迎和亲切接待。我们北京市人民和全中国人民将永远珍视中苏两国人民情同手足的深厚友谊，并且衷心地感谢苏联人民对我国的兄弟般的巨大援助。我们也请伏罗希洛夫同志和其他苏联同志们把我们中国人民的真挚友谊带给兄弟的苏联人民。（经久不息的掌声）
    最后，让我再一次向伏罗希洛夫同志和其他苏联同志们表示热烈欢迎，并且希望同志们在参观中在我们接触中对于我们工作中的缺点和错误给予批评和指正。（热烈鼓掌）
    中苏两国人民的牢不可破的兄弟友谊万岁！（热烈鼓掌）
    以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭的伟大团结万岁！
　　世界和平万岁！（全场起立热烈鼓掌，欢呼：万岁！）
