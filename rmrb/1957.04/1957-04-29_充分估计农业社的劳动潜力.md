Fully Estimate the Labor Potential of Agricultural Cooperatives

    In many places, the agricultural production cooperatives' production increase targets for this year are set somewhat low. One of the reasons for this phenomenon is an underestimation of labor potential. During last year's production upsurge, many cooperative cadres, driven by a blind enthusiasm, demanded that production be doubled or even multiplied within a year. They made overly hasty demands for changing farming systems and improving technology, undertook too much basic construction, and overtaxed the members. The members' household labor and family sideline production were also squeezed out by the cooperative's labor. It is entirely necessary to correct this tendency now and appropriately compress last year's overly high targets. However, if we conclude from this that last year's seasonal labor tension was entirely caused by overly high production targets and that the only way to avoid excessive labor tension is to lower the targets, then that would be wrong.
    Generally speaking, seasonal labor tension is an unavoidable phenomenon in agricultural production. Excessive labor tension may be caused by overly high production targets, or it may be due to poor production arrangements and improper use of labor. Last year, most agricultural cooperatives were newly established, and they lacked experience in formulating production plans and managing labor. Some cooperatives both set overly high production increase targets and did not know how to arrange production and organize labor rationally. During the busy farming season, they appeared to be short of labor and unable to cope. Some cooperatives' production plans were not too large, but because production labor was poorly organized, the phenomenon of attending to one thing and losing sight of another also occurred during the busy farming season. Although some cooperatives had relatively high production increase targets, they thought of more ways to arrange production and used labor more rationally, so they smoothly passed through the busy farming season and greatly increased production. Last year, the "July 1st" Cooperative in Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, greatly increased the area of double cropping. During the wheat harvest season, various farm tasks were squeezed together, and there was a shortage of labor, which led to some crops being abandoned. At that time, many cooperative members believed that the area of double cropping was too large and the production increase targets were too high. However, after careful inspection, it turned out that the reason for the abandonment of crops was not a genuine shortage of labor, but that the labor organization of some production teams was poor, resulting in a lot of wasted work; in addition, some people lacked a sense of responsibility and did very sloppy work, resulting in more wasted labor. This cooperative used the second, third, and ninth production teams as a comparison to illustrate this situation. On average, each male full laborer in the second and third production teams was responsible for 9.2 mu of cultivated land, while each male full laborer in the ninth production team was responsible for an average of 8.8 mu of cultivated land. The soil quality of the cultivated land in the second and third teams was also not as good as that of the ninth team. However, the second and third teams had a good foundation as older cooperatives, and their labor was properly allocated. During the busy farming season, all farm tasks were completed, and the livestock were also well fed. The ninth team's labor was poorly allocated, the crops were abandoned, and the livestock were also emaciated. Last year, the Gonghe Cooperative in Fushun County, Sichuan Province, planted double-cropping rice on 94.7% of the paddy field area and implemented intercropping and relay cropping on more than 80% of the cultivated land, harvesting three to four crops a year, with a multiple cropping index of 250%. The tension of labor during the busy farming season can be imagined. However, this cooperative took many measures to solve the problem of labor shortage. In addition to conscientiously implementing contracted work and output quotas to strengthen the members' sense of responsibility for production and improve labor efficiency, they also took many other measures. For example, they distinguished between urgent and non-urgent farm tasks in advance, bringing forward what could be brought forward and postponing what could be postponed. All the farm tools and furniture needed during the busy farming season were prepared in advance to avoid temporary scrambling. They also mobilized members to arrange their housework before the busy farming season and organized small vendors to deliver daily necessities to their doorsteps, reducing members' loss of work due to housework or going to market. In addition, they tried their best to improve production tools and increase labor efficiency. For example, using an improved rice thresher increased labor efficiency by 10%. This cooperative rationally arranged production and labor through various measures and overcame the difficulty of labor shortage during the busy farming season. A total of 645.5 standard laborers in the cooperative did an average of 210 workdays each. Among them, the main laborers did an average of 270 workdays, the semi-laborers 120 workdays, and the auxiliary laborers 56 workdays. The members' income increased by an average of 50% compared to 1955, and household chores and family sideline production were also appropriately taken care of.
    These examples prove that whether or not production can be arranged and labor can be used rationally plays a decisive role in whether or not production can be increased. Last year, some people only started from the abstract concept of "more people, more power" in agricultural cooperatives and underestimated the lack of experience in business management and the actual difficulties in human and material resources in agricultural cooperatives, setting the production increase plan too high. This was not a realistic attitude. However, now some people, because they want to avoid the shortcomings that occurred last year, underestimate the power of collective labor and ignore the subjective initiative of people. This also violates the spirit of seeking truth from facts.
    Striving for a bumper harvest in agriculture this year is the common demand of the country and the peasants. Every agricultural cooperative should try its best to improve production a step further and not regress or stagnate. Under the existing production conditions, where more investment cannot be increased and no agricultural machinery can be used, the main way to strive for increased production is still to promote various measures to reform the farming system and improve farming techniques. Adopting these production increase measures will inevitably require more labor. In some areas, especially those with fewer people and more land, the difficulty of labor shortage will be encountered. This requires us to think of more ways to rationally use labor. Facts have proved that there is still a lot of labor potential in rural areas. The agricultural cooperatives in Linxiang County, Hunan Province, are located in a lake area with more land and fewer people. Last year, the area of double-cropping rice accounted for 70% of the paddy field area, and opening up lake wasteland and transplanting deep-water rice expanded the cultivated land area by more than 460 mu. More than 350 mu of dry land were converted into paddy fields, and the planting area of cash crops such as cotton and sesame was more than 8,700 mu. The production plan was relatively advanced, and the labor utilization rate was also relatively high. Last year, production increased by 58%, and 98% of the members increased their income. This cooperative plans to further increase production this year, and the amount of labor required has also increased accordingly. According to preliminary calculations, based on the requirements of this year's production plan, there is a shortage of more than 33,000 workdays. What should we do? They analyzed the labor situation of the members last year, summarized the experiences and lessons in labor management last year, and finally came to the conclusion that among all the members, there were eight specific situations of people who could have worked more last year but worked very little. As long as they are helped from the aspects of strengthening ideological education, improving labor management, and solving specific difficulties, the attendance rate can be greatly improved. It is estimated that the total number of workdays that all members can do this year can be increased by more than 36,000, an increase of 17% compared to last year. The labor utilization rate of this cooperative was already relatively high, and now there is still a lot of labor potential. Of course, those cooperatives that had a relatively low labor utilization rate or had more serious wasted work in the past have even greater labor potential.
    After participating in agricultural cooperatives, especially after participating in advanced cooperatives, encouraged by the principle of distribution according to work and more pay for more work, the vast majority of members are willing to work more in the cooperative. However, many agricultural cooperatives still have some members who have not fully utilized their labor force. Some people cannot work more because they have difficulties in life or lack small farm tools and rain gear. Many women cannot participate or rarely participate in the cooperative's production labor because they are burdened by their children or are not good at arranging housework. Some people lacked the habit of field labor in the past and cannot insist on working regularly. In addition, there are also some wealthy peasants who still doubt whether cooperatives can increase production more and are willing to engage in more of their own family sideline production and are unwilling to work more in the cooperative. Some people with other sources of income are also not very enthusiastic about participating in cooperative labor. As for the lack of experience in labor management in agricultural cooperatives, the allocation of work to members is not appropriate enough, making the members' labor unevenly distributed; or the contracted work and quotas are not reasonable enough, and the members are unwilling to work more; or there is a lack of regular ideological education and inspection, so although the members work more, the labor efficiency is not high. If problems such as these are properly resolved, the labor force can still be increased a lot.
    All of this shows that the labor potential of agricultural cooperatives is great. Agricultural cooperatives in all regions should fully estimate and give play to this potential, make the production plan both advanced and reliable, and make the production plan an action program to mobilize all positive factors in the cooperative to strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture this year.

    充分估计农业社的劳动潜力
    不少地方的农业生产合作社，今年的增产指标都订得有些偏低了。产生这种现象的原因之一，是对劳动潜力估计不足。在去年的生产高潮当中，有许多办社干部从一股盲目的热情出发，要求一年内把生产提高一倍甚至数倍，对改变耕作制度和改进技术的要求过急，基本建设搞得太多，社员劳累过度，社员的家务劳动和家庭副业生产也被社的劳动挤掉了。现在来纠正这种偏向，对去年过高的指标加以适当压缩，这是完全必要的。但是，如果就此推论，说去年季节性的劳动紧张完全是由增产指标过高所造成，要避免劳动过度紧张就只有压低指标，那就不对了。
    一般说来，季节性的劳动紧张，是农业生产难免的现象。劳动过分紧张，可能是增产指标过高引起的，也可能是由于生产安排不好，劳力使用不当。去年大部分农业社都是初办，制定生产计划没有经验，管理劳动同样没有经验。有些社既制定了过高的增产指标，又不会合理地安排生产，组织劳动，农忙时期更加显得劳力不足，忙不过来。有些社生产计划并不过大，但因生产劳动组织得不好，农忙时也发生顾此失彼的现象。有些社虽然增产指标比较高，但它们在安排生产方面多想了些办法，劳动力的使用也比较合理，农忙季节就顺利度过了，生产也大大增加了。陕西省长安县“七一”社去年大量增加了复种面积，麦收季节各种农活挤在一起，出现了劳力不足的现象，丢荒了部分庄稼。当时许多社员都认为复种面积太大了，增产指标太高了。但是经过认真检查，原来庄稼丢荒的原因并不是劳力真正不足，而是部分生产队劳动组织得不好，窝工很多；加上有些人责任心不强，做活质量很粗糙，结果多费了工。这个社以第二、第三生产队和第九生产队作对比，说明了这个情况。第二、第三生产队，平均每个男全劳力负担耕地九亩二分，第九生产队每个男全劳力平均负担耕地八亩八分。第二、三队的耕地土质还不如第九队。但第二、三队是老社底子，劳力支配得法，农忙期间农活都完成了，牲口也喂得好。第九队劳力支配得不好，庄稼荒芜了，牲口也喂瘦了。四川省富顺县共和社去年种双季稻占稻田面积94.7％，并在80％以上的耕地上实行了套种、间种，一年收三熟到四熟，复种指数达250％，农忙时期劳力的紧张情况可以想见。但是，这个社采取了许多办法，解决了劳力不足的问题。他们除了认真实行包工包产，以加强社员对生产的责任心和提高劳动效率以外，还采取了其他许多办法。比如事先对农活分清缓急，能提前的提前，能推后的推后；农忙期间所需一切农具家具，事先都准备妥当，以免临时乱抓；又在农忙前动员社员把家务事安排好，并组织小商贩把日用必需品送上门，减少社员因家务事或赶集误工。此外，他们还尽量改进生产工具，提高劳动效率。如用改良打谷机打谷，就使劳动效率提高了10％。这个社通过各种办法对生产和劳动作了合理安排，克服了农忙时期劳力不足的困难。计全社六百四十五点五个标准劳力，平均每个做二百一十个劳动日。其中主要劳力平均做劳动日二百七十个，半劳力一百二十个，辅助劳动力五十六个。社员收入平均比1955年增加了50％，家务事和家庭副业生产也得到了适当照顾。
    这些例子证明，会不会安排生产和合理使用劳力，对能否增产起着决定性的作用。去年有些人只从农业社“人多力量大”的抽象概念出发，对农业社还缺乏经营管理经验以及人力物力方面实际存在的困难估计不足，把增产计划订得过高，这不是实事求是的态度。但是，现在一些人因为想避免去年发生的缺点，又低估了集体劳动的力量，忽视了人的能动作用，这同样违反了实事求是的精神。
    争取今年农业大丰收，是国家和农民的一致要求。每个农业社都应该尽可能把生产提高一步，不能后退或停止不前。在既不能增加更多的投资，又没有农业机器可以利用的现有生产条件下面，争取增产的主要途径，仍然是推广改革耕作制度、改进耕作技术方面的各种措施。采用这些增产措施，必然要付出比较多的劳动。在一些地区，特别是人少地多的地区，就会碰到劳力不足的困难。这就要求我们在劳动力的合理使用方面多想办法。事实证明，目前农村中劳动潜力还是很大的。湖南省临湘县农业社处在地多人少的湖区。去年这个社双季稻面积占稻田面积70％，开湖荒、插深水稻共扩大耕地面积四百六十多亩，把三百五十多亩旱地改成了水田，棉花、芝麻等经济作物播种面积有八千七百多亩，生产计划比较先进，劳动利用率也比较高。去年生产增加了58％，98％的社员增加了收入。这个社今年计划进一步提高生产，劳动需要量也随着增加了。据初步计算，根据今年的生产计划要求，缺少劳动日三万三千多个。怎么办呢？他们分析了去年社员的劳动情况，总结了去年劳动管理方面的经验教训，最后得出了这样的结论：全体社员当中，有八种具体情况不同的人去年可以多出工而出工很少。只要从加强思想教育、改进劳动管理、解决具体困难等方面对他们进行帮助，就可以大大提高出工率。总计今年全体社员可能做的劳动日总数，可以增加三万六千多个，比去年提高17％。这个社劳动利用率本来就比较高，现在还有很大的劳动潜力；那些过去劳动利用率还比较低或者窝工现象比较严重的社，劳动潜力当然还会更大。
    农民参加了农业社，特别是参加了高级社以后，在按劳取酬、多劳多得的分配原则的鼓舞下面，绝大多数社员都愿意在社内多劳动。可是，许多农业社仍然有一些社员没有把劳动力全部发挥出来。有些人因为生活困难或者缺少小农具和雨具，没有办法多出工；不少妇女因为孩子拖累或不善于安排家务劳动，也还不能参加或很少参加社内的生产劳动；有的人过去缺乏田间劳动习惯，不能坚持经常出工。此外，也还有一些富裕农民，对合作社能否多增产还有怀疑，愿意多搞自己的家庭副业，不愿在社里多做工；一些有其他经济来源的人，参加社内劳动的积极性也不高。至于因为农业社劳动管理缺乏经验，对社员分配工活不够恰当，使社员劳动忙闲不均；或者包工、定额不够合理，社员不愿多做工或者缺乏经常的思想教育和检查，社员虽然出工多而劳动效率不高。诸如此类的问题，如果得到适当的解决，劳动力就还可以增加不少。
    所有这些，都说明农业社的劳动潜力很大。各地农业社应当充分估计和发挥这种潜力，把生产计划订得既先进又可靠，使生产计划成为动员社内一切积极因素争取今年农业大丰收的行动纲领。
