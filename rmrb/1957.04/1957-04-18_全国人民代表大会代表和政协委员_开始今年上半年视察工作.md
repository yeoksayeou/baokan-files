Xinhua News Agency, April 17th. National People's Congress deputies and members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) have recently begun their inspection work for the first half of this year. More than 360 deputies and members in Beijing are participating in this inspection.

The areas covered by this inspection include 24 provinces and municipalities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Fujian, Hebei, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Guangdong, and Heilongjiang, as well as the two autonomous regions of Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang Uygur.

Before the deputies and members in Beijing departed for inspections, they participated in ten consecutive enlarged meetings of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, where they listened to and discussed work reports from the Ministry of Higher Education, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the Ministry of Public Security, and the Ministry of Justice. During the discussions, the deputies and members raised many questions, suggestions, and criticisms. Responsible persons from relevant government departments answered the deputies' and members' inquiries at the meetings. CPPCC members in Beijing also listened to reports from the Local Work Committee and the Learning Committee of the CPPCC National Committee in order to inspect the work of local CPPCC committees.

This inspection work is being carried out in the context of widespread discussions throughout the country on the issue of how to correctly handle contradictions among the people, as proposed by Chairman Mao Zedong at the Supreme State Conference. The majority of deputies and members studied and discussed Chairman Mao Zedong's speech at the Supreme State Conference. In order to better exert their supervisory role over the various tasks of the country and assist the government in correctly adjusting relations among the people, the deputies and members are all preparing to further improve their inspection work. At a group discussion of deputies and members held on April 12th, some deputies and members suggested that they prepare to focus on conducting in-depth inspections in one area, or to conduct in-depth investigations and research on one task, in order to better understand the situation and discover problems.

As of the end of March this year, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress had received more than 1,000 questions and opinions raised by deputies and members based on their inspections in the second half of last year. These questions and opinions have now been forwarded to relevant central departments and provincial and municipal People's Committees, People's Courts, and People's Procuratorates for handling or reference. 490 deputies and members participated in the inspections in the second half of 1956.

Xinhua News Agency, April 17th. More than 120 deputies of the National People's Congress and members of the National Committee of the CPPCC began inspecting the work of Beijing Municipality in various fields on the 17th. They will inspect for about a month.

The Beijing Municipal People's Committee invited the deputies and members participating in the inspection to a forum today to specifically discuss the steps, methods, and related matters of the inspection. Deputy Mayor Zhang Youyu welcomed the deputies and members at the meeting, hoping that they would offer more criticisms and suggestions during the inspection in order to further improve the work of Beijing Municipality. He said that the content of the inspection would be arranged according to the requirements of the deputies and members; the methods of inspection would mainly be divided into comprehensive and professional, and could be carried out collectively or individually.

Several deputy mayors of Beijing Municipality and responsible persons from relevant departments of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee introduced the situation of Beijing Municipality in various fields, such as industry, agriculture, commerce, urban construction, education, and health, to the deputies and members. Li Xiaolu, Director of the General Office of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, reported on the handling of the 218 opinions raised by deputies and members during the last inspection. He said that the vast majority of the opinions had been dealt with, and written replies had been made to 142 of them.
