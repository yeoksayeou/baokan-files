(Reported by this newspaper from Hangzhou on April 26th) From April 18th to 26th, the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened an enlarged plenary session of the committee and a meeting on propaganda work, respectively, to conscientiously study Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, as well as other documents. Party and non-Party cadres attending the meeting gathered together and had a heated discussion, combining it with the specific circumstances of Zhejiang Province.

During the discussion on how to distinguish between contradictions among the people and contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, some comrades pointed out that because some contradictions among the people in the past were mixed with the activities of counter-revolutionary elements, they would naturally associate the discovery of contradictions with counter-revolutionary sabotage. For example, in a cooperative in Xiaosha District, Dinghai County, cooperative members tied up the cooperative director, the township head, and the township party branch secretary. Upon hearing the news, the county committee suspected counter-revolutionary activity. After sending people to the township to investigate, it was found that three party members in the cooperative were guilty of corruption, and the township party branch secretary was always scolding people, which made the masses very dissatisfied. The cooperative members who tied up the cadres were basic members of the masses. During the investigation, the cooperative members put forward four demands: clearing the accounts, returning the embezzled property, dealing with the corruption problem, and re-electing cadres. The county committee expressed its support for the opinions of the masses, and the masses themselves also examined their mistake of tying people up and actively threw themselves into production. Everyone believed that in such situations, it is necessary to be calm, good at distinguishing and analyzing the nature of contradictions, and actively solving them. If not handled properly, the contradiction will expand, and even transform non-antagonistic contradictions into antagonistic ones.

During the discussion, many cadres also examined their past mistakes and shortcomings in handling contradictions among the people, and further realized that old thinking and old ways of working are no longer suitable for today's situation. If they do not change quickly, they will be abandoned by the times.

What is the method to resolve contradictions among the people? In the discussion, everyone unanimously agreed that the only method is to strengthen political and ideological education for the masses, using the method of "unity – criticism – unity." Many cadres examined that in the past, they had relaxed ideological education for the masses, one-sidedly publicized the happy life of socialism, neglected the ideological education of hard struggle, and often adopted simple and crude "suppression" methods when encountering problems. This not only failed to resolve contradictions but also sharpened them. For example, in one county, gambling was rampant among the masses after the Spring Festival this year. The county leaders adopted the method of catching gamblers, which not only did not completely quell the gambling trend, but even made women who were previously dissatisfied with gambling dissatisfied with the government. Some places adopted persuasive education methods to quell gambling, and the masses consciously stopped gambling.

During the discussion, everyone believed that although detailed persuasive education is much more difficult and troublesome than simple and crude "suppression," as Communist Party members, they should overcome all difficulties and be determined to change old thinking and old ways of working.

To correctly resolve contradictions among the people, in addition to strengthening ideological work and overcoming bureaucratism, subjectivism, and sectarianism, many comrades pointed out that it is also necessary to do a good job in running cooperatives diligently and thriftily and democratically, and actively lead the masses in carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy. This is the most fundamental way to solve various contradictions in agricultural cooperatives. Doing so can, on the one hand, mobilize the enthusiasm of the people to fight against nature, develop production, and improve material life; on the other hand, the improvement of the people's material life will also reduce contradictions among the people. For example, comrades in the Zhoushan fishing area said: "Fishery production increased last year, and the number of problems among the people has decreased this year."

During the study and discussion period, party committee secretaries at all levels also conducted research on how to implement the study of the correct handling of contradictions among the people after returning. Many counties are preparing to adopt the principle of studying, examining, and improving work simultaneously after returning, and implement it through methods such as rectifying cooperatives, production, and convening meetings of cooperative member representatives. Some counties are also preparing to summarize the correct and incorrect methods of handling contradictions among the people in the past, learn from experience and lessons, distinguish right from wrong, and educate cadres, so that all cadres can gradually understand and master the significance and methods of correctly handling contradictions among the people.

### 浙江结合具体情况讨论内部矛盾  干部认识必须改变老一套作风

    浙江结合具体情况讨论内部矛盾
    干部认识必须改变老一套作风
    本报杭州26日电　4月18日到26日，中共浙江省委分别召开了全体委员会议（扩大）和宣传工作会议，认真学习了毛主席在最高国务会议上关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的讲话和其他文件。参加会议的党内外干部齐集一堂，结合浙江省的具体情况，讨论得很热烈。
    干部们在讨论人民内部矛盾和敌我矛盾的界限如何划分的问题时，有的同志提出，由于过去人民内部矛盾中有一些是夹杂了反革命分子的活动，所以一发现矛盾，就自然地联想到反革命的破坏。如定海县小沙区一个社的社员们把社长、乡长、乡支部书记绑起来了，县委听到讯息，就怀疑有反革命的活动。经派人到乡调查，发现这个社有三个党员贪污，乡支部书记开口就训人，群众很不满，绑人的社员都是基本群众。在调查时，社员提出清理帐目、退回贪污财物、对贪污问题要处理、改选干部等四个要求。县委表示支持群众意见，群众自己也检讨了绑人的错误，并且积极地投入了生产。大家认为，碰到这种情况，一定要冷静，要善于区别和分析矛盾性质，积极地去解决矛盾。如果处理不好，就会使矛盾扩大，甚至会把非对抗性的矛盾转化为对抗性的矛盾。
    在讨论中，许多干部还检查了过去在处理人民内部矛盾中的错误和缺点，进一步认识了旧思想和老一套作风已经不能适合今天的形势了，如不赶快转变，就会被时代抛弃。
    用什么办法来解决人民内部的矛盾，讨论中大家一致认为，唯一的办法是加强对群众的政治思想教育，用“团结——批评——团结”的方法。许多干部检查了过去放松了对群众的思想教育，片面宣传社会主义幸福生活，忽视了艰苦奋斗的思想教育，碰到问题常常采取简单粗暴的“压服”办法，这样不但不能解决矛盾，反而使矛盾尖锐了。如有一个县，今年春节后群众赌博盛行，县的领导方面采取了抓赌的办法，不但没有完全平息赌风，反而连过去对赌博不满的妇女也不满政府了。有的地方采取说服教育的办法平息赌博，群众就自觉地不赌了。
    讨论中，大家认为，虽然细致的说服教育比简单粗暴的“压服”要困难得多，麻烦得多，但是作为共产党员来说，应该排除万难，一定要下决心改变旧思想、旧作风。
    正确地解决人民内部矛盾，除了加强思想工作、克服官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义外，许多同志提出，还要搞好勤俭办社和民主办社，积极领导群众开展增产节约运动，这是从最根本方面解决农业社中各种矛盾的方法。这样做，一方面可以调动人民的积极性，向自然界作斗争，发展生产，改善物质生活；另一方面，人民物质生活提高了，也会减少人民内部的矛盾。如舟山渔区的同志说：“去年渔业增产了，今年人民内部的问题就减少了。”
    在学习和讨论期间，各级党委书记对回去如何贯彻学习正确处理人民内部矛盾问题也进行了研究。许多县准备回去后采取边学习、边检查、边改进工作的方针，通过整社、生产、开社员代表大会等方法进行贯彻。有些县还准备总结过去正确的和错误的处理人民内部矛盾的方法，吸取经验教训，分别是非，教育干部，使所有的干部逐步认识、掌握正确处理人民内部矛盾的意义和方法。
