Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 16th: The "Hindustan Times" reported on April 16th that former Nepalese minister Daman Raj Yami revealed an international conspiracy by Western countries under the guise of "searching for the Yeti" and demanded that this activity be stopped.

Speaking to reporters in Kathmandu, Yami said that Western countries, under the guise of searching for the Yeti, are trying to comprehensively survey the Sino-Nepalese border and turn this area into a place for their conspiracies, attempting to create disputes on the Sino-Nepalese border.

In recent years, many American magazines and newspapers have groundlessly promoted the so-called "Yeti" living in the Himalayas. These publications have even promised large sums of money to whoever finds the "Yeti". Many foreigners have been searching in the Himalayas day and night. Currently, there is already a group of Americans in Nepal searching for the "Yeti", and several more groups of Americans will be coming here soon.

Yami said: "I myself have lived in this area for seven years and crossed the Himalayas at least twenty times. But I have not even seen a shadow of any such thing."

    寻找雪人为名
    间谍活动是实
    据新华社新德里16日电“印度斯坦日报”4月16日说，前尼泊尔大臣达马拉特纳·雅米揭露了西方国家以“寻找雪人”的名义进行的国际阴谋；并且要求制止这种活动。
    雅米在加德满都对记者发表谈话说，西方国家以寻找雪人的名义正在设法全面勘察中尼边境，并且把这个地区变成它们进行阴谋活动的场所，竭力想在中尼边境制造纠纷。
    最近几年来许多美国杂志和报纸毫无根据地宣传在喜马拉雅山住有所谓“雪人”，这些报刊说它们还许诺谁找到“雪人”将给以大笔的金钱。好多外国人在喜马拉雅山日日夜夜地寻找。目前在尼泊尔已经有一批美国人在寻找“雪人”，过些时候还有几批美国人要到这里来。
    雅米说：“我本人在这个地区住了七年，越过喜马拉雅山至少有二十次。可是我连任何这种东西的一点影子也没有看到过。”
