(Dispatch from our correspondent in Moscow, April 26) Spring ploughing is in full swing across the vast fields of the Soviet Union. By April 20, collective farms and state farms had sown 16.3 million hectares of spring crops, double the amount sown by the same period last year. Agricultural workers in various republics are extensively engaged in socialist competition. As of April 20, collective farmers in Ukraine had sown over 6 million hectares of spring crops, fulfilling 43% of the plan. The Central Asian republics have completed 60-70% of their sowing plans. The sowing area is expanding from south to north, reaching the central part of the Russian Federation, Kazakhstan, the Urals, and the virgin lands of Siberia. The Russian Federation had sown 4.4 million hectares of spring crops by April 20.

Winter crops will still account for a large proportion of this year's total grain output. Winter crops cover nearly 40 million hectares, of which no less than half is wheat. In the south, winter crops are growing earlier this spring than last spring. In southwestern Ukraine and Moldova, winter wheat has already begun to tiller. In the North Caucasus and the Central Black Earth Region, as well as the Central Non-Black Earth Region and western Siberia, winter crops are in good condition. Agricultural workers are applying top dressing and harrowing to winter crops, with approximately twice as much fertilizer being applied as last year.

Soviet agricultural workers are determined to make the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution a year of bumper harvests for all agricultural products. They are not only paying attention to grain but also to other crops, especially those related to increasing meat and milk production. As of April 20, collective farms across the Soviet Union had planted 768,000 hectares of corn, collective farms and state farms had planted 957,000 hectares of sugar beets, a portion of potatoes and vegetables, and 1.39 million hectares of cotton. Uzbekistan, the main cotton-producing region, has successfully planted approximately 900,000 hectares, fulfilling 73% of the plan.

    苏联田野上　处处春耕忙
    各加盟国的农业劳动者挑起竞赛
    本报莫斯科26日电　在苏联广阔的田野上展开了紧张的春耕工作。截至4月20日，在集体农庄和国营农场已经播种一千六百三十万公顷春种作物，比去年同期快一倍。各个加盟共和国的农业劳动者广泛地进行社会主义竞赛。乌克兰集体农民截至4月20日已经播种了六百万公顷以上春种作物，即完成计划的43％。中亚各加盟共和国已经完成播种计划的百分之六、七十。播种的面从南往北扩展到俄罗斯联邦的中部、哈萨克斯坦、乌拉尔、西伯利亚的新地。俄罗斯联邦到4月20日已经播种四百四十万公顷春种作物。
    冬种作物在今年谷物总产量中仍将占较多的比重。冬种作物近四千万公顷，其中不下半数是小麦。在南方，冬种作物今春比去春长得早。在乌克兰西南部和摩尔达维亚，冬小麦已经分蘖。在北高加索和中央黑土地带，在中央非黑土地带和西伯利亚西部，冬种作物的情况都很好。农业劳动者对冬种作物进行着追肥和耙土的工作，现在追施的肥料约为去年的两倍。
    苏联农业劳动者决心使十月革命四十周年成为一切农产品大丰收的一年。他们不单注意谷物而且注意其他作物，特别是与提高肉类和牛乳生产有关的作物。截至4月20日，全苏集体农庄种了七十六万八千公顷玉米，集体农庄和国营农场种了九十五万七千公顷甜菜，种了一部分马铃薯和蔬菜，种了一百三十九万公顷棉花。主要产棉区乌兹别克斯坦顺利地种了约九十万公顷，完成计划73％。
