Xinhua News Agency, 18th: The National Conference of Health Department Directors, which concluded in Beijing on the 15th, advocated improving the implementation of publicly funded healthcare. Many facts cited by local health department directors at the meeting illustrated two problems with publicly funded healthcare: serious waste and the current medical capacity struggling to meet the heavy demands of publicly funded healthcare.

Some at the meeting pointed out that some patients receiving publicly funded healthcare were not actually sick, which caused unnecessary congestion in outpatient clinics. The production of medicines (especially expensive ones) could not keep up with demand, and there was significant waste of medicine expenses in publicly funded healthcare. One patient in Wuhan received a hundred bottles of tiger bone wine in a month, not for personal consumption, but for the entire family to drink. One patient requested a doctor to prescribe forty doses of expensive traditional Chinese medicine at once, and some people only took three days' worth of medicine out of a seven-day prescription. Many places were overspending on publicly funded healthcare, such as Wuhan, which overspent 600,000 yuan last year.

The conference discussed ways to improve the publicly funded healthcare system. Everyone advocated strengthening education on conservation for those enjoying publicly funded healthcare, and encouraging everyone to pay attention to exercise and hygiene in normal times; at the same time, medical personnel should be educated to conserve medicines, not to indulge patients, and to use substitutes for expensive medicines whenever possible. Some suggested charging for outpatient visits, charging for medicines, or charging a portion of the entire medical expenses to prevent waste. However, opponents believed that charging fees would affect early treatment and delay treatment opportunities. Some advocated that the publicly funded healthcare expenses be managed by the units enjoying publicly funded healthcare themselves. After several units in Hunan Province implemented this method last year, the publicly funded healthcare expenses not only did not exceed the budget but also had a surplus. After several units in Tianjin managed their own publicly funded healthcare expenses, the rate of staff seeking medical attention decreased significantly. The benefit of this method is that it can promote the strengthening of preventive healthcare work in various units, which is convenient for preventing waste in publicly funded healthcare. Others opposed this method because some units still overspent after implementing this method, large units might not be able to use up the funds, while small units might not have enough, and it would be difficult to adjust between large and small units. Another opinion was to advocate for the abolition of the publicly funded healthcare system, with subsidies given to those in need. Opponents believed that this method was inconsistent with the principle of distribution according to work, and at present, the economic situation of general state workers is not generous, their families do not enjoy publicly funded healthcare, and it would be difficult for them to pay for their own medical care; although waste in publicly funded healthcare is serious, those who waste are ultimately in the minority.

The Ministry of Health is preparing to further study specific plans to improve the implementation of publicly funded healthcare.

In addition to the issue of publicly funded healthcare, the conference focused on discussing grassroots health organizations, traditional Chinese medicine, and disease prevention and control.

### 全国卫生厅局长会议  主张改进公费医疗实施办法

    全国卫生厅局长会议
    主张改进公费医疗实施办法
    新华社18日讯　15日在北京结束的全国卫生厅、局长会议主张改进公费医疗实施办法。各地卫生厅、局长在会议上举出的许多事实，说明公费医疗中存在着两个问题：浪费情况严重和目前医疗力量难于应付繁重的公费医疗任务。
    会上有些人指出：公费医疗病人中有些病人其实并没有病，这就使门诊造成不必要的拥挤。药品（特别是贵重药品）的生产跟不上需要，而公费医疗中药费的浪费很大。武汉一病人一月领了一百瓶虎骨酒，不是病人个人喝，而是全家喝。有个病人要求医师一次开四十剂贵重中药，有些人开了七天的药只吃了三天。许多地方公费医疗经费要超支，例如武汉市去年超支六十万元。
    这次会议讨论了改进公费医疗制度的办法。大家都主张加强对享受公费医疗的人进行节约教育，并且鼓励大家平时注意锻炼身体和讲究卫生；同时也要教育医务人员节约药材，不要迁就病人，贵重药品尽可能用代用品。有人主张门诊收费，药品收费或整个医疗费用中收一部分费用的办法，来防止浪费。但反对者认为，收费的办法会影响早期治疗，延误治疗时机。有人主张公费医疗经费由各享受公费医疗的单位自己管理。湖南省去年有几个单位实行这个办法后，公费医疗经费不但没有超支，还有节余。天津市有几个单位自己掌握公费医疗经费后，工作人员就诊率降低了很多。这个办法的好处是可以促使各单位加强预防保健工作，便于防止公费医疗中的浪费现象。也有人反对这个办法。因为有些单位实行这个办法后经费仍旧超支，大单位经费可能用不完，而小单位很可能不够用，大小单位间不易调剂。另外一种意见是主张取消公费医疗制，有困难的给予补助。反对者认为这个办法不合按劳取酬原则，同时目前一般国家工作人员经济并不宽裕，家属已经不享受公费医疗，自己看病还要花钱恐怕都有困难；公费医疗中浪费现象固然严重，但浪费者究属少数。
    卫生部准备进一步研究改进公费医疗实施办法的具体方案。
    除了公费医疗问题以外，这次会议着重讨论了基层卫生组织、中医中药和防治疾病问题。
