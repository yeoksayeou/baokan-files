Three Types of Vegetable and Meat Cutting Machines

    Zeng Jigang, a lieutenant quartermaster assistant at a certain infantry school of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, has created three types of vegetable and meat cutting machines.

    These three types of vegetable and meat cutting machines can be powered by both electricity and hand-crank. When powered by electricity, the universal vegetable cutting machine can cut 7,500 jin of vegetables per hour, which is equivalent to the workload of 500 people in one hour. The drum-type vegetable cutting machine can cut 2,700 jin of vegetables per hour, which is equivalent to the workload of 180 people in one hour. The meat cutting machine can cut 300 to 400 jin of meat per hour, which is equivalent to the workload of 60 to 70 people in one hour.

    三种切菜、切肉机
    中国人民解放军某步兵学校的中尉给养助理员曾纪感创造了三种切菜、切肉机。
    这三种切菜、切肉机都是电动、手摇两用的。用电力发动，每台万能切菜机每小时能切菜七千五百斤，约等于五百人一小时的工作量，滚筒式切菜机每小时能切菜二千七百斤，约等于一百八十人一小时的工作量，切肉机每小时能切肉三百至四百斤，约等于六十至七十人一小时的工作量。
