Chairman Liu Shaoqi said that the delegation's visit to China will further develop and consolidate the brotherly friendship between the peoples of China and Romania, promote close cooperation between the parliaments of the two countries, and will be conducive to the unity of socialist countries and the cause of world peace.

Chairman Constantin Pârvulescu then delivered a speech (see page 5).

He also said that he is convinced that the delegation's visit to China will greatly promote closer friendly cooperation between the peoples of Romania and China.

The plane carrying the distinguished guests landed at Beijing Airport at 11:35 this morning. At this time, more than 500 people welcoming at the airport burst into thunderous applause. A group of girls in beautiful costumes presented flowers to the distinguished guests.

Romanian and Chinese national flags were flying at the airport. As the distinguished guests walked in front of the welcoming crowd at the airport, people cheered in unison: "Long live the Romanian people!" "Long live Romanian-Chinese friendship!"

Among those who welcomed the delegation at the airport today were Lin Boqu, Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Li Weihan, Chen Shutong, Vice-Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and members in Beijing, Vice Premier of the State Council Nie Rongzhen, Secretary-General Xi Zhongxun, Vice-Chairmen of the National Defense Council Zhang Zhizhong, Long Yun, Vice-Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Zhang Bojun, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, Vice Mayors of Beijing Zhang Youyu, Yue Songsheng, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPPCC Liu Ren, heads of various committees under the National People's Congress, heads of the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and various people's organizations, and representatives in Beijing of the National People's Congress delegation and the Beijing Municipal People's Committee delegation who previously visited Romania.

Xinhua News Agency, April 29th. Chairman Liu Shaoqi held a banquet tonight to welcome the delegation of the Romanian Grand National Assembly and the Bucharest City People's Council, headed by Chairman Constantin Pârvulescu.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi spoke at the banquet, expressing his heartfelt and warm welcome to the "envoys of the great Romanian people."

After talking about the continuous development of Romania's socialist construction, Chairman Liu Shaoqi said that the Romanian people are now actively striving to realize the Second Five-Year Plan in their beautiful and rich homeland. The Chinese people are very pleased to see the brilliant achievements of the Romanian people in socialist construction, and regard this achievement as our own. We believe that the Romanian people will achieve new and greater achievements in the implementation of the Second Five-Year Plan.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi also said that the Chinese people are extremely satisfied to see the great contributions made by the Romanian people in maintaining world peace and developing the cause of human progress.

He said: The friendly cooperation between our two countries in the political, economic, and cultural fields is constantly developing. The People's Republic of Romania has given us great assistance in supplying agricultural tractors and petroleum industrial equipment, and in sending experts to impart advanced experience. On behalf of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the Chinese people, he expressed his heartfelt gratitude to the Romanian Grand National Assembly and the Romanian people. He said that the fraternal friendly cooperative relationship between our two countries vividly embodies the profound friendship between the peoples of China and Romania and the great unity between socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union. This friendship and unity is eternal, unbreakable, and no force can shake it.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi pointed out that this friendly visit to China by the delegation and the visit to Romania by the delegation of the National People's Congress of China not long ago are of great significance for further developing the brotherly friendship between the peoples of China and Romania, for strengthening the unity of socialist countries, and for safeguarding the cause of world peace.

Chairman Constantin Pârvulescu then spoke, expressing his heartfelt thanks to the host. He said that although China and Romania are thousands of miles apart, they have very close ties, connecting the people of our two countries, because we believe in the same ideology—Marxism-Leninism, and we have a common cause.

He praised the Chinese people's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle led by the Chinese Communist Party for decades. He said that after these struggles were victorious, the Chinese Communist Party united all the progressive forces that cooperated with them and built the country into a socialist country. He said that the great achievements made by the Chinese people in socialist construction are exciting to the people of all countries.

Chairman Constantin Pârvulescu said: "We are very pleased that the Chinese Communist Party can put forward their opinions in a timely manner to oppose right-leaning or 'left'-leaning errors, so as to strengthen the unity of the socialist camp."

He said that the Romanian people are reliable friends of the Chinese people, and the Romanian people fully sympathize with and support the Chinese people's construction cause; and firmly believe that the Chinese people have sufficient material and spiritual strength to make the socialist cause victorious in China.

During the banquet, the guests repeatedly toasted for the unbreakable and eternal friendship between the peoples of China and Romania, for the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, for the victory of Marxism-Leninism, and for lasting world peace.

Romanian Ambassador to China Teodor Rudenco and his wife were invited to attend the banquet tonight.
