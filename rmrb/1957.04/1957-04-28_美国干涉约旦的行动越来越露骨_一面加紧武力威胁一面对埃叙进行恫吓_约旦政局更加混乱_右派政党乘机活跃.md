(Comprehensive report from our newspaper) The United States' intervention in Jordan is becoming increasingly blatant. While intensifying military threats in the Middle East, it is openly intimidating Egypt and Syria.

Following the dispatch of ships from the US Sixth Fleet to the Eastern Mediterranean, a US Navy Department spokesman announced on April 26 that five ships from the US Atlantic Fleet's amphibious force, carrying a battalion of US Marines, would sail to the Mediterranean on April 28. In addition, a tank landing ship will sail to the Mediterranean on May 1.

On April 25, the same day the US Department of Defense announced the dispatch of the Sixth Fleet to the Middle East, Secretary of State Dulles held talks with bipartisan leaders of Congress regarding the situation in Jordan. It is said that government officials told congressional leaders that if Syrian troops did not withdraw from Jordan as requested by King Hussein of Jordan, it could "lead to disputes."

State Department spokesman White told reporters on April 26 that US diplomatic officials in the Middle East are continuing to maintain "daily contact" with Middle Eastern governments regarding the situation in Jordan. They clearly stated the US position and urged these countries to "act cautiously and with restraint."

Reports say that White revealed that the countries warned by the United States include Egypt and Syria.

However, the Arab people cannot be intimidated. The Cairo newspaper "People's News" published a commentary on April 26, warning the United States not to interfere in the situation in Jordan. The commentary said, "American interference risks transforming the domestic crisis in Jordan into an international conflict, which could escalate into a global conflict." The commentary also said that the Arab people are vigilant and aware of all the imperialists' schemes. After the imperialists interfere in our brotherly country of Jordan, the Arab people will hate the imperialists even more strongly and resolutely.

In Britain, many bourgeois newspapers, commenting on the US dispatch of the Sixth Fleet, believed that this action was necessary to intervene in the situation in Jordan, but were also afraid that intervention would "bring bad consequences." For example, the Conservative Party's "Daily Telegraph" said that if pro-Western forces lost in Jordan, "the balance of power in the Middle East would undergo a drastic change that would be extremely unfavorable to the free world." However, this newspaper also said that intervention would also bring bad consequences; "as long as there is a threat or willingness to intervene," it will immediately "give Arab nationalism a pretext." The Labour Party's "Daily Herald" wrote: Foreign intervention could ignite war in the entire Middle East at any time, "which could trigger a global conflict."

Martial law continues to be implemented throughout Jordan. The new government's Minister of Defense, Tuqan, has been appointed as the military governor of all of Jordan, and a military governor has also been appointed for Amman, the capital of Jordan. Armored vehicles and tanks are stationed at major strongholds on the streets of Amman. The army took over the telephone bureau, and the people in the city could not make phone calls. Amman was completely cut off from the rest of the country. The Friday prayers of Muslims on April 26 were also cancelled.

Reports say that up to six hundred people have been arrested, most of whom belong to the parties that participated in the previous Prime Minister Nabulsi's cabinet. In addition, more than sixty free officers who expressed firm opposition to imperialist conspiracies were imprisoned at Amman military airport. Three Egyptian reporters stationed in Amman were also arrested.

At the same time, right-wing parties began to become active. The right-wing parties such as the Arab Constitutional Party and the Muslim Brotherhood, which occupy a minority of seats in parliament, are regrouping, attempting to seize control of parliament.

According to the Syrian "Light News," a large number of Iraqi police and soldiers, wearing Jordanian army uniforms, have infiltrated Jordanian territory, attempting to launch terrorist activities against the Jordanian people.

King Hussein and the people around him rely on the desert troops, and are hastily arming the "Muslim Brotherhood" and those who fled to Jordan from the dissolved pro-fascist Syrian National Socialist Party.

According to newspaper reports, the US Embassy in Amman is the guidance center of the imperialist conspiracy. The most active person in this conspiracy is the US military attaché at the US Embassy in Amman, whom many newspapers call the planner of the assassination of former Syrian Deputy Chief of Staff Colonel Maliki. Many staff members of the embassy and the Point Four Program implementation agency have also shown great enthusiasm. (Attached picture)

### 美国干涉约旦的行动越来越露骨  一面加紧武力威胁一面对埃叙进行恫吓  约旦政局更加混乱　右派政党乘机活跃

    美国干涉约旦的行动越来越露骨
    一面加紧武力威胁一面对埃叙进行恫吓
    约旦政局更加混乱　右派政党乘机活跃
    本报综合报道　美国对约旦的干涉行动越来越露骨了。在加紧对中东地区进行武力威胁的同时，公然向埃及和叙利亚施加恫吓。
    紧接着美国第六舰队舰只开往东地中海之后，美国海军部发言人在4月26日又宣布，载有一营美国海军陆战队的五艘美国大西洋舰队两栖部队舰只将在4月28日开往地中海。此外，还有一艘坦克登陆舰将在5月1日开往地中海。
    25日，美国国防部宣布向中东出动第六舰队的同一天，国务卿杜勒斯曾就约旦局势同国会两党领袖举行会谈。据说，政府官员曾经对国会领袖说，如果叙利亚军队不照约旦国王侯赛因所要求的那样退出约旦，那就可能“产生纠纷”。
    国务院发言人怀特26日对记者说，美国驻中东的外交官员正在继续就约旦局势同中东各国政府保持“日常联系”，他们清楚地说明了美国的态度，并且要这些国家“行事谨慎和有克制”。
    消息说，怀特透露，受到美国警告的国家包括埃及和叙利亚。
    但是，阿拉伯人民是吓不倒的。开罗“人民报”26日发表评论，警告美国不要干涉约旦局势。评论说，“美国的干涉有使约旦的国内危机转变成为国际冲突的危险，它可能会恶化成为全世界的冲突。”评论还说，阿拉伯人民是警惕着的，他们知道帝国主义者的一切诡计。在帝国主义干涉我们兄弟之邦——约旦之后，阿拉伯人民就将更加强烈和更加坚决地仇恨帝国主义者。
    在英国，许多资产阶级报纸在评论美国出动第六舰队的时候都认为这种行动对约旦局势的干涉是必要的，但是同时也害怕干涉会“带来恶果”。例如保守党的“每日电讯报”说，假如亲西方势力在约旦失利，“中东的力量对比将发生对自由世界极其不利的剧烈变化。”但是这家报纸又说，干涉也将带来恶果；“只要是扬言或者表示愿意进行干涉”，就会立即“使阿拉伯民族主义获得口实”。工党的“每日先驱报”写道：外国干涉有使整个中东随时燃起战火的可能，“这就可能引起世界性的冲突。”
    约旦全国仍然继续实行戒严。新政府的国防大臣图康已被任命为全约旦的军事长官，另外还任命了约旦首都安曼的军事长官。安曼街头主要据点都停留着装甲车和坦克。军队接管了电话局，城内老百姓电话打不通。安曼同全国其他各地完全断绝了联系。4月26日穆斯林的礼拜五祈祷也被取消了。
    有消息说，被捕的已达六百人，他们大多数属于参加前首相纳布西内阁的党派。另有六十多名表示坚决反对帝国主义阴谋的自由军官被监禁在安曼军用机场。三个驻在安曼的埃及记者也遭到了逮捕。
    同时，右翼党派开始表现活跃。在议会中占少数席位的阿拉伯制宪党、穆斯林兄弟会等右翼党派正在重新聚集起来，企图夺取议会的控制权。
    据叙利亚“光明报”报道，大量伊拉克警察和军人穿着约旦军队的军装渗入约旦境内，企图对约旦人民展开恐怖活动。
    侯赛因国王和他周围的人士依靠沙漠部队，并且把“穆斯林兄弟会”和被解散的亲法西斯的叙利亚国家社会党中逃到约旦去的人士匆匆忙忙武装起来。
    据报刊报道，美国驻安曼大使馆是帝国主义阴谋的指导中心。最积极地搞这个阴谋的人是美国驻安曼大使馆武官，许多报纸把他叫做暗杀前叙利亚陆军副参谋长马利基上校的活动的策划人。大使馆和第四点计划执行机构的许多工作人员也表现了很大的积极性。（附图片）
