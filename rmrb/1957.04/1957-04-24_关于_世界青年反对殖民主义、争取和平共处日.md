Regarding “World Youth Day Against Colonialism and for Peaceful Coexistence”

April 24th is “World Youth Day Against Colonialism and for Peaceful Coexistence.” This year, youth around the world are commemorating this significant day for the first time.

In the past few years, vast numbers of youth, students, and other people from various countries have designated February 21st each year as “Day of Struggle Against the Colonial System.” On this day, they engage in various forms of activities to strengthen the struggle against colonialism and support oppressed nations in their fight for independence.

The origin of the February 21st festival is as follows: In February 1948, the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the International Union of Students convened the "Southeast Asian Youth and Student Conference for National Independence and Freedom" in Calcutta, India. During the conference, a demonstration involving 100,000 young people took place, and it was suggested that February 21st of each year be designated as "Day of Support for the Struggle of Colonial Youth." This was because this day marked the anniversary of the Indian people's anti-British uprising in 1946, and also the anniversary of an anti-British demonstration by Egyptian workers and students in 1947. Later, the World Federation of Democratic Youth supported this initiative, calling on youth from all countries to commemorate this day each year by strengthening the struggle against colonialism, and naming it "Day of Struggle Against the Colonial System."

Seven years have passed since 1948, and the world's anti-colonial movement has achieved tremendous development and significant results. Many countries have embarked on the path of independent development. In particular, the First Asian-African Conference held in Bandung from April 18th to 24th, 1955, by twenty-nine countries in the Asian-African region, was of great historical significance for the further development of the world's anti-colonial struggle. The participating countries unanimously adopted resolutions on opposing colonialism and promoting world peace and cooperation, solemnly declaring that "colonialism, in all its manifestations, is an evil that must be eradicated quickly." Therefore, the Asian-African Student Conference held in Bandung in June 1956 passed a resolution stipulating that April 24th each year (the closing day of the Asian-African Conference) would be "Asian-African Student Day Against Colonialism." The International Union of Students expressed its support for this resolution. The World Federation of Democratic Youth Council also made a resolution at its Sofia meeting in August last year to further designate April 24th as "World Youth Day Against Colonialism and for Peaceful Coexistence," and called on youth around the world to carry out extensive commemorative activities on this day.

### 关于“世界青年反对殖民主义、争取和平共处日”

    关于“世界青年反对殖民主义、争取和平共处日”
    4月24日是“世界青年反对殖民主义、争取和平共处日”。今年，全世界青年第一次纪念这一有重大意义的日子。
    过去几年，各国广大的青年、学生和其他人民群众，把每年的2月21日作为“反对殖民制度斗争日”，在这一天展开各种形式的活动，以加强反对殖民主义和支援被压迫民族争取独立的斗争。
    2月21日这个节日的由来是这样的：1948年2月，世界民主青年联盟和国际学生联合会在印度加尔各答召开了“东南亚青年与学生争取民族独立与自由大会”，会议期间举行了有十万青年参加的示威游行，并建议规定每年的2月21日为“支援殖民地青年斗争日”。这是因为这天是1946年印度人民发动反英大起义的纪念日，也是1947年埃及的工人和学生举行反英示威的一个纪念日。以后，世界民主青年联盟支持了这个倡议，号召各国青年每年以加强反对殖民主义的斗争来纪念这个日子，并把它定名为“反对殖民制度斗争日”。
    从1948年起经过了七年，世界反殖民主义运动有了巨大的发展，并且获得了很大的成果。许多国家走上了独立发展的道路。特别是1955年4月18日至24日，亚非地区二十九个国家在万隆举行的第一次亚非会议，对于世界反殖民主义斗争的进一步的发展具有重大的历史意义。与会各国一致地通过了关于反对殖民主义、促进世界和平和合作的决议，庄严地宣布：“殖民主义在其一切表现中是一种应当迅速予以根除的祸害”。因此，1956年6月在万隆举行的亚非学生会议通过了一项决议，规定每年4月24日（亚非会议闭幕日）为“亚非学生反对殖民主义日”。国际学生联合会对这个决议表示支持。世界民主青年联盟理事会并在去年8月的索非亚会议中作出决议，把4月24日进一步定名为“世界青年反对殖民主义、争取和平共处日”，并号召全世界青年在这一天进行广泛的纪念活动。
