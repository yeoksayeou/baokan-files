    Flying from Moscow to Beijing
    Our Correspondent　Dai Feng

    Spring has come to the banks of the Moscow River. The snow on the streets has melted. The early-blooming Daphne mezereum, the first to flower in early spring, attracts people with its unique brilliance and fragrance…
    The Soviets call spring a season of joy and friendship.
    April 14th was a particularly exciting day in the early spring of Moscow. Comrade Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, and his entourage left Moscow for a friendly visit to China. The Soviet guests traveled thousands of miles to bring the friendly spring of Moscow and the deep friendship of the Soviet people to the Chinese people.
    At half-past nine, we left the city center by car and headed for Vnukovo Airport to go to Beijing with Chairman Voroshilov. Forty minutes later, we arrived at the airport, where the national flags of China and the Soviet Union fluttered in the wind. The world-famous "Tu-104" jet airliner was parked in the center of the airport, looking particularly energetic under the illumination of more than a dozen high-intensity lights. Chairman Voroshilov would be flying to our motherland's capital, Beijing, on this plane.
    At one end of the airport stood a crowd of well-wishers. The crowd was filled with laughter and joy, filled with love and friendship.
    I strolled around the airport, and I clearly remembered the exciting scene three months ago when Premier Zhou Enlai led our government delegation to this airport: countless welcoming crowds applauded and cheered enthusiastically in the wind and snow; Chairman Voroshilov and other Soviet party and government leaders warmly shook hands with Premier Zhou and the members of the delegation… Today, old friends who have been separated for three months will meet again in Beijing.
    At 10:43, Voroshilov arrived at the airport. He got out of the "ZIS" car, and the Soviet party and government leaders who came to see him off stepped forward and warmly shook his hand to congratulate him. Diplomats from various countries also wished him a safe journey.
    At 11:00 Moscow time, Chairman Voroshilov, accompanied by Liu Xiao, the Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, stepped onto the escalator to board the plane. Five minutes later, the first plumes of white smoke shot out from the jet nozzles on both sides of the plane. The plane shook its arrow-shaped wings and gradually left the parking area, gliding towards the smooth runway. At this moment, the well-wishers standing at the entrance of the airport waved their hands together. Voroshilov also waved back from the window. The plane sped down the runway for a minute, soared into the sky, and circled once over the Moscow sky illuminated by thousands of lights, before heading east.
    The beautiful night scene of Moscow, like a sea of stars, had just disappeared behind us, and the Soviet comrades on the same plane had already begun calculating the time of landing in Beijing.
    It was a quiet, clear night. The full moon poured out all its brilliance, and the starry sky shone. The night was so quiet, the moonlight so gentle. Who could not be lost in thought on this enchanting night? I leaned against the window and recalled…
    In late March, during my 2,000-kilometer trip to Ukraine, I was deeply moved by the heart of millions of people loving China with one mind. In every city and town I visited, I could see and feel the love of the Soviet people for the Chinese people. Pavel Rukaichi, a veteran worker at the Zaporozhye Steel Plant, enthusiastically asked me: "Has Angang been fully built?" "Where will the second largest steel capital be built?" "Will Chairman Mao Zedong come here this year? Didn't Voroshilov accept his invitation to visit China? I think he will invite Chairman Mao Zedong to the Soviet Union." Temiyev, a welder at the Kharkov Generator Factory, excitedly said to me: "Look, tell our dear Chinese friends that the generators we made for the Chinese people can be delivered to China ahead of schedule." Bratchin, the President of Kharkov State Gorky University, praised the Chinese students for their excellent academic performance and hoped that more would be sent to the Soviet Union.
    Living in the Soviet Union is like living in an ocean of friendship. From the vast and cold Siberia to the picturesque Ukraine, from Leningrad on the Baltic coast to Kazakhstan bordering our country, I deeply felt wherever I went how the Soviet people loved the Chinese people and supported the Chinese people in action. In the Soviet Union, in almost every large and medium-sized industrial city, countless workers are working day and night for our socialist construction projects. I will always remember what Petrov, an old tree planter at the Michurin Botanical Garden in Novosibirsk, said to me:
  "Our friendship is like the Siberian apple tree, which can withstand the test of severe cold. Fruit trees need to be cultivated and watered at all times. Only in this way can they grow strong and prosperous, bear better and more fruit, and be more afraid of the world's coldest tests. ..."
    A Soviet comrade came over and asked me a question, which woke me from my reverie.
    It was late at night. Moscow time was already 1:00 AM on the 15th. The female attendant turned off the lights in the cabin. Chairman Voroshilov rested in the front cabin, and the entourage came to the rear cabin, put down the foldable sofa, closed their eyes, and rested.
    When the first ray of dawn quietly climbed into the windows of the plane, we woke up one after another. At this time, the plane tilted down and rushed into the white fog. At 2:35 AM Moscow time, the plane landed in Omsk. After resting for an hour, we continued flying. At 6:30 AM Moscow time, the plane landed in Irkutsk on the Sino-Soviet border. As soon as the plane came to a stop, Chairman Voroshilov came from the front cabin to the rear cabin, wished everyone good morning, and asked with great concern, "How was your rest?" A crowd of people were waiting at the Irkutsk airport to welcome us. Among the welcoming crowd were Ji Pengfei, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of China, and Wang Zhuoru, Director of the Protocol Department, who had arrived here on the 14th to welcome Chairman Voroshilov from afar. When Chairman Voroshilov appeared at the cabin door, there was a burst of warm applause. What familiar applause! Just in January this year, when Premier Zhou visited the Soviet Union and passed through Irkutsk, the people here called Premier Zhou's visit to the Soviet Union "a new flower of solid friendship." Today, people welcomed Chairman Voroshilov, who was passing through, again in this moment of strong spring, so that Chairman Voroshilov could bring their deep friendship with the Chinese people to China.
    Chairman Voroshilov had breakfast here. During the meal, he frequently toasted to Sino-Soviet friendship. He said: "I can't drink too much, I still have to hurry on my way, the people of Beijing are waiting for us!"
    At 7:37 AM Moscow time, the plane left Irkutsk and entered our motherland's airspace in about half an hour. Soviet comrades who have been to China told me that Beijing is just ahead when you see the Great Wall. I anxiously searched for the trace of the Great Wall through the window.
    The Soviet photographers in the same cabin have once again checked their cameras to see who can best capture the scene of Chairman Mao and Chairman Voroshilov's warm meeting!
    The plane tilted down steadily again, and dear Beijing was already in our sight. As soon as the plane came to a stop, Chairman Voroshilov straightened his collar and walked to the cabin door, which had not yet been opened. At this moment, I saw that our dear Chairman Mao was already standing next to the plane. (Image attached)

    Soviet Supreme Soviet Presidium Chairman Voroshilov, at the invitation of our Chinese Chairman Mao Zedong, left Moscow for Beijing on a "Tu-104" jet plane at 11:00 PM on April 14th (equivalent to early morning on April 15th, Beijing time). Those who came to the airport to see him off included Bulganin, Kaganovich, Malenkov, Mikoyan, Molotov, Pervukhin, Saburov, Suslov, Khrushchev, Brezhnev, Furtseva, Aristov, Shvernik, as well as Soviet Supreme Soviet Presidium Vice Chairmen Tarasov, Paletskis, and Kuusinen, as well as some generals, ministers, and ambassadors to the Soviet Union.

### 从莫斯科飞向北京

    从莫斯科飞向北京
    本报记者　戴枫
    春天来到了莫斯科河畔。街头上的积雪已经融化。初春里最早开花的晚合花，以自己特有的鲜艳和郁香吸引着人们……
    苏联人把春天称之为愉快友爱的季节。
    4月14日，是莫斯科初春里特别令人兴奋的一天。苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫同志和随行人员们离开莫斯科前往中国作友好访问。苏联贵宾们千里迢迢给中国人民带去莫斯科友爱的春天，带去苏联人民的深厚友谊。
    九时半，我们驱车离开了市中心，驶往伏努科夫飞机场，随伏罗希洛夫主席一起到北京去。四十分钟后，到了机场，机场上中苏两国国旗迎风飘扬。驰名世界的“图—一○四”喷气客机停在机场正中，在十多盏光度强烈的灯光照耀下，显得格外精神抖擞。伏罗希洛夫主席将乘着这架飞机飞往我们祖国的首都北京。
    机场的一端站立着欢送的人群。人群中充溢着欢笑和欣喜，充溢着热爱和友谊。
    我漫步在机场上，我清楚地记忆起了三个月前周恩来总理率领我国政府代表团到达这个机场时的激动人心的情景：数不清的欢迎的人群，在风雪中无限热情地鼓掌、欢呼；伏罗希洛夫主席和其他的苏联党政领导人一一同周总理和代表团团员们亲切地握手……今天，分别了三个月的老朋友又要在北京相会了。
    十点四十三分，伏罗希洛夫来到了机场。他下了“吉斯”车，前来欢送他的苏联党政领导同志迎向前去，热烈地向他握手道贺。各国使节们也祝他一路平安。
    莫斯科时间十一时正，伏罗希洛夫主席在中国驻苏联大使刘晓的陪同下，踏上了上飞机的扶梯。五分钟后，飞机左右两旁的喷气筒里射出了第一股白烟，飞机抖动了一下箭形的机翼，渐渐离开停机场，滑向平稳的跑道。这时，站立在机场入口处的欢送者们一齐挥动着手。伏罗希洛夫也隔窗挥手。飞机在跑道上快速地滑了一分钟，冲入天空，又在万盏灯火的莫斯科上空绕了一圈，随即向东方飞去。
    莫斯科星海一般美丽的夜景刚刚隐没在我们后边，同机的苏联同志们已经开始计算起着陆北京的时刻了。
    这是一个岑寂、明净的夜晚，圆月倾泻出全部的光辉，静谧的天空群星闪耀。夜是这样幽静，月光是这样柔和，有谁能在这迷人的夜晚不有所思呢？我倚着窗口回忆着……
    3月下旬，我在访问乌克兰二千多公里的行程中，被一颗万人同一的热爱中国的心深深吸引住了。我每到一城一镇，都能看到和感到苏联人民对中国人民的热爱。萨波罗什炼钢厂的老工人巴维尔·鲁开奇热情地问我：“鞍钢全部建好了没有？”“第二大钢都将建在哪里？”“毛泽东主席今年来不来我们这里？伏罗希洛夫不是接受了他的邀请而要访问中国吗？我想，他会请毛泽东主席来苏联的。”哈尔科夫发电机制造厂的电焊工人特米也夫兴奋地对我说：“看吧，告诉亲爱的中国朋友们吧，我们为中国人民制造的发电机可以提前送到中国去了。”哈尔科夫国立高尔基大学的校长布拉钦满口称赞中国学生的学习成绩都很好，希望再多派些到苏联来。
    生活在苏联的日子里，正如生活在友谊的海洋里一样。我从辽阔寒冷的西伯利亚走到景色绮丽的乌克兰，从波罗的海滨的列宁格勒到毗邻我国疆界的哈萨克斯坦，每到一地我总深深体会到苏联人民是怎样热爱着中国人民，又在行动上支持着中国人民的。在苏联，几乎每一个大、中工业城市的工厂里，都有无数的职工们在日夜辛勤地为我们的社会主义建设工程而努力着。我永远记得新西伯利亚米丘林植物园老植树工人彼得洛夫对我说的话：
  “我们的友谊正像西伯利亚的苹果树一样，是经得住严寒的考验的。果树需要时刻来培植它，浇灌它。这样它才能长得壮大，繁盛，果子也会结得愈好愈多，也就愈不怕世界的最寒冷的考验。……”
    一位苏联同志走来问了我一声，我才从沉思中醒了过来。
    夜深了。莫斯科时间已是十五日清晨一时了。女服务员同志关熄了舱里的电灯，伏罗希洛夫主席休息在前舱，随行人员来到后舱放下了可以折叠的沙发，合上眼睛，休息了。
    当第一线晨曦悄悄地爬进飞机的窗户的时候，我们陆续地醒来了。这时飞机倾斜下来，冲进了白茫茫的云雾团里。莫斯科时间二时三十五分，飞机降落在鄂木斯克。休息了一个小时，继续飞行，莫斯科时间六时三十分，飞机降落在中苏边境上的伊尔库次克。飞机稍稍停稳了，伏罗希洛夫主席从前舱来到后舱，向全体同志问早安，并十分关切地问大家“休息得怎样？”伊尔库次克机场上等候着欢迎的人群。在这欢迎的人群里有14日来到这里远迎伏罗希洛夫主席的中国外交部副部长姬鹏飞、礼宾司司长王倬如，当伏罗希洛夫主席出现在机舱门口的时候，传来了一片热烈的鼓掌声。这是多么熟悉的掌声呵！就在今年1月周总理来苏联访问路经伊尔库次克的时候，这里的人民把周总理来苏联访问称为“巩固的友谊的新花朵”。今天，人们又在春意正浓的时刻迎接了过路的伏罗希洛夫主席，让伏罗希洛夫主席把他们对中国人民的深厚的友谊带到中国去。
    伏罗希洛夫主席在这里用了早餐。席间频频为中苏友谊而干杯。他说：“不能多喝了，还要赶路，北京人民正在等待我们呢！”
    莫斯科时间七时三十七分时飞机离开了伊尔库次克，半小时左右就进入了我们祖国的领空。到过中国的苏联同志告诉我，看见了长城，北京就在眼前了。我焦急地隔窗寻觅着长城的踪迹。
    同舱的苏联摄影记者同志们已又一次地检查了摄影机，看谁第一个最好地摄下毛主席和伏罗希洛夫主席亲热的会见的镜头！
    飞机又一次稳稳地倾斜下来，亲爱的北京已经在我们的眼下了。飞机刚刚停稳，伏罗希洛夫主席整理了一下衣领，走到尚未打开的机舱门口。这时，我看到亲爱的毛主席也已经站立在飞机旁边了。（附图片）
    苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫应我国毛泽东主席的邀请，于4月14日夜十一时（相当于北京时间15日清晨）乘“图——一○四”喷气式专机离莫斯科来北京。到机场送行的有布尔加宁、卡冈诺维奇、马林科夫、米高扬、莫洛托夫、别尔乌辛、萨布罗夫、苏斯洛夫、赫鲁晓夫、勃列日涅夫、福尔采娃、阿里斯托夫、什维尔尼克以及苏联最高苏维埃主席团副主席塔拉索夫、帕列茨基斯、库西宁以及一些将军、部长和各国驻苏使节。左图是在莫斯科伏努科夫机场上欢送伏罗希洛夫主席的情况，前面左起：布尔加宁、米高扬、赫鲁晓夫、伏罗希洛夫、马林科夫和卡冈诺维奇。
