　　Spring breezes have turned the banks of the Unnamed Lake green, and the peach blossoms by the lake are bursting into bloom. This is where Peking University students stroll and chat, and you will often meet students from Poland here.

　　There are currently fifteen of them studying at Peking University. Most are studying Chinese language, literature, and history. Together with international students from other countries, they live in the most beautiful part of the campus, near the North and South Pavilions, artificial rocks, lawns, paths, tall locust trees, and low-lying wisteria. The buildings where they live have reading rooms and clubs. The university arranges many activities for international students, such as going to the city to see plays, visiting places, and taking holiday trips. They enjoy the right to free medical care and recuperation at public expense.

　　European living habits are different from ours, and the school tries its best to accommodate them in this regard. At Peking University, there is a Western food section for international students. The staff often seeks their opinions and improves the food according to their preferences.

　　The Polish students are doing well in their studies. In the first semester of 1956-1957, all their grades were good or excellent. To help them study better, many Chinese students have taken on the role of tutors, and many nights they are together with their dear international friends under the light, reviewing their lessons. The Chinese student Wang Dapeng is an example. He often reads Cao Yu's play "Peking Man" with Li Ang, a Polish student studying in the Chinese Department.

　　Like many international students, the Polish students are also very interested in Chinese things. Shi Bigao is a graduate student from the University of Warsaw. He studies Yuan Dynasty opera, translates Chinese works, and also learns Chinese chess and Go, and loves Chinese calligraphy and painting. He and his Chinese friend Ren Zhaoding are inseparable, talking about music, spending holidays together, and studying ancient Chinese. Li Ang is also enthusiastically learning to write calligraphy.

　　The Polish students will be the communicators of culture between China and Poland. We believe that through them, the Polish people will understand our country better, and the friendship between China and Poland will develop further. (Ge Ren)

    波兰留学生在北京大学
    春风吹绿了未名湖岸，湖畔的桃花绽破蓓蕾开放了。这里，是北京大学的同学散步谈心的地方，时常，你也会遇见来自波兰的同学。
    他们现在在北京大学学习的一共有十五人。大都是学习中国语言文学和历史的。和各国留学生一起，他们住在风景最优美的地方，附近有南北阁楼、假岩、草地、小径、高大的槐树和低矮的紫萝等。他们住的各院有阅览室，有俱乐部。学校为留学生安排了许多活动，如进城看戏、参观、假期旅行等。他们享受公费医疗和免费休养的权利。
    欧洲人的生活习惯和我们是有不同的，学校对这方面加以尽可能的照顾。在北京大学，有留学生西餐部，工作人员经常征求他们的意见，根据他们的喜好来改进伙食。
    波兰同学的学习很好。1956—1957年的第一学期，他们全部成绩都是优良。为了使他们能更好的学习，许多中国同学担负了辅导员的工作，不少的夜晚在同一盏灯的照耀下和他们亲爱的国际朋友在一起温习功课。中国同学王大鹏就是个例子，他时常和在中文系学习的波兰留学生李昂一块儿朗读曹禺的剧本“北京人”。
    正如许多留学生一样，波兰同学对中国的东西也很感兴趣。史比高是来自华沙大学的研究生，他研究元曲，翻译我国的著作，而且，他还学习中国象棋、围棋，爱好中国的字画。他和中国同学任肇鼎是形影不离的好朋友，在一起谈音乐，度过假日，研究古代汉语。李昂，他也在兴致勃勃地学写毛笔字。
    波兰留学生将是中波两国文化的沟通者，我们相信通过他们，波兰人民会更加了解我国，中波两国的友谊会更加发展。（戈任）
