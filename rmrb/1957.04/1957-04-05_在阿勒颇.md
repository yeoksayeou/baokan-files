    In Aleppo
    By Our Correspondent Jiang Yuanchun
    We stayed at a hotel in downtown Aleppo. Waking up in the morning, we suddenly heard a dull explosion, much like a hand grenade. People on the street below were talking about it. Soon after, everything returned to normal.
    Later, we learned that it was reactionaries throwing bombs in Aleppo, attempting to create riots. This place is close to Turkey. Although the Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party and the Communist Party have considerable influence and strength here, the pro-imperialist reactionary forces are also very strong. They are dissatisfied with the policy of peace and neutrality currently pursued by the Syrian government and, instigated and supported by imperialism, attempt to realize the so-called "Aleppo independence" conspiracy. However, thanks to the resolute measures taken by the Syrian government and army, this conspiracy was suppressed. From our two-day stay in Aleppo, the city life was stable as usual, and there was no such chaos as the Western news agencies had publicized.
    The imperialists chose Aleppo as a place to create riots for a reason. Aleppo has a population of nearly 400,000 and is the largest city in Syria, connecting to the port of Latakia on the Mediterranean in the west, and to the Euphrates River and the Jezirah region in the east. It is also an important industrial and agricultural center. If the imperialist's running dogs were to realize their conspiracy, Syria would suffer a fatal blow politically and economically.
    Aleppo is a very beautiful city. Standing on the hills west of Aleppo and overlooking the entire city, you feel as if you have stepped into a fairy tale from Hans Christian Andersen. In the center of the city stands an ancient castle, surrounded by rows of houses, with minarets of mosques peeking out everywhere. This 13th-century ancient castle is built on a small hill, surrounded by a moat 20 meters deep and 30 meters wide. The slope of the hill is very steep, and the slope is also paved with stone slabs. It is very difficult for the enemy to attack it. It is said that in history, only Timur of Mongolia conquered this castle in 1401 AD. Inside the castle there are also some buildings, but many have been destroyed due to war and earthquakes. Here, the ruins of the ancient Hittite palace have also been discovered. Due to financial difficulties, excavations have not yet proceeded.
    The 20-meter-high minaret of the Great Mosque at the northern end of the castle is well preserved. Climbing up the steps to the top, you can see the panorama of Aleppo and its surroundings. From here, you can see the Taurus Mountains on the border between northern Syria and Turkey. Iskenderun, a seaport at the foot of the snow-capped Amanus Mountains in the northwest, and the ancient city of Antakya used to belong to Syria, but were forcibly cut off by France and given to Turkey. The Syrian people still remember these places to this day. Some Syrian maps still draw these two cities within the territory of Syria. To the east, you can see a rolling plain of Aleppo, with the Euphrates River only 95 kilometers away. This plain, formed by the Taurus Mountains and the central Syrian highlands, is the most fertile area in Syria. One-third of Syria's wheat fields, 44% of its barley fields, and 37% of its cotton fields are concentrated here. However, due to the greater profit from cotton cultivation, more and more cotton is being planted recently. Further east is the Jezirah region. Since 1950, capitalist farms planting cotton have seen great development in this area. As a result, Aleppo has become an important cotton distribution center and a center for the cotton textile industry.
    According to the president of the Aleppo Chamber of Commerce, Aleppo now has five larger cotton textile factories, as well as many cotton ginning and baling plants. The rayon textile industry is also well developed, with raw materials imported from countries such as France, West Germany, Sweden, and Italy. There is a cement plant with a daily output of 900 tons, and plans are being made to build a new plant with a daily output of 400 tons. In addition, there are some light industries such as soap making. Aleppo's total industrial output value accounts for half of the country's total industrial output value, with 72,000 workers (out of 125,000 workers nationwide). Aleppo's commerce is mainly cotton exports. The export volume reaches 80,000 tons per year, half of which is shipped to France. A portion is also shipped to the United Kingdom. China also purchased 9,000 tons last year. Now that imperialists are imposing an economic blockade on Syria, with France and the United Kingdom halting cotton purchases, this has created difficulties for the Syrian economy. Imports are mainly agricultural machinery used on farms.
    The development of cotton planting in northern Syria plays an important leverage role in Syria's economic development. According to materials from the Syrian Ministry of National Economy, Syria's national income in 1956 was 1.7 billion Syrian pounds, of which agriculture accounted for 45%, animal husbandry accounted for 20%, and industry, commerce, and other income accounted for 35% (according to another Syrian official material, industrial and commercial income accounted for 13% in 1954). The annual rate of increase in national income is 5%-8%. Syria's economic development has been significant in the more than ten years since its independence. Comparing 1945 with 1956, firstly, cotton production increased from 5,000 tons to 95,000 tons, and correspondingly, cotton yarn increased from 1,000 tons to 10,000 tons, and cotton fabrics increased from 15 million meters to 100 million meters. Due to the development of cotton production and trade, landlords, agricultural, and commercial capitalists had money, and the construction industry also developed. Investment in the construction industry has reached 175 million Syrian pounds. The cement required for construction also increased from 80,000 tons in 1945 to 350,000 tons in 1956. With the development of cotton planting, the cultivated area has expanded, and irrigation and water conservancy projects have also developed. Accompanying this is an increase in other agricultural products. Vegetable oil (olive oil, cottonseed oil) increased from zero in 1945 to 10,000 tons in 1956. Syria used to need to import wheat, but now wheat can be exported. In 1956, 350,000 tons of wheat and 500,000 tons of barley were exported. Capital accumulated from the agricultural sector is partly invested in industry, allowing industrial production to also develop. Therefore, the imperialist blockade of Syria's cotton exports is extremely malicious.
    Near the castle, in addition to several famous mosques, there is also a famous market, called "Souk." This market is composed of many alleys connected in series, with shops on both sides of the alleys. Each alley has a stone-built vault, with small holes in the vault to let in natural light. Because the light is not enough, many shops are lit with lamps. Each street sells different goods, a wide variety of everything, and silk fabrics for women seem to be the most numerous. The streets are not wide, so the people coming and going seem particularly crowded. Customers seem to be mainly farmers and herders from the desert, many of whom ride small donkeys, with the sound of hooves clip-clopping through the crowd, becoming a notable feature of this market. It is said that the total length of all the streets and lanes in this market is 20 kilometers, making it one of the largest markets in the Arab world. In spring, green grass grows on its stone vaults, and it is said that sheep can be grazed on it.
    Surrounding the ancient castle, there are also many historical sites, especially many ancient inns. These are places where caravan traders from Central Asia or the Persian Gulf rested when Aleppo was a must-pass place for east-west trade. There is also a very famous museum here, which houses precious cultural relics of ancient peoples who once lived on this land of Syria, which cannot be described in detail here.
    There is a river in Aleppo called the Quweiq River. However, this river originates in Turkish territory to the north, and its water source has been cut off by Turkey, so it is almost without water. Aleppo had to build a water diversion project, using pumps to pump water from the Euphrates River 95 kilometers away up the riverbank, which is more than 100 meters high, and transport it to Aleppo through pipelines. After clarification and disinfection, it is supplied to the city for use. This project is well-built, and it uses its own electricity to generate ozone as a water disinfectant.
    We also visited some schools in Aleppo, mainly primary schools. The Aleppo municipal authorities have set up some good primary schools not only in the bustling city center but also in the poorer areas far from the city center, and the equipment is relatively good. Some primary school buildings are under construction. It is said that these primary schools set up for poor children were built by a project called "One Piastre (currency unit, one-hundredth of a Syrian pound) Plan" relying on donations. Primary schools are all co-educational, but boys and girls are separated in class, and tuition is not charged, only textbook fees.
    Primary education in Syria is compulsory education, totaling five years. Junior high school education is four years, and senior high school education is three years. The primary school students all wear black uniforms, and the style of the tops is a bit like Caucasian shirts, and they all look quite energetic.
    When we came out of a primary school, a middle-aged man who looked like a worker, with a four or five-year-old child, greeted us at the door. The child was very beautiful, with black hair, a round face, and a pair of intelligent, double-lidded eyes. Pushed by his father, the child came forward and shook hands with each of us. He told us his name was Bakri Akko and gave us a photo of him. He hopes we will tell the world: "We don't want war, we want peace!"
    Yes, this is a harsh era, this is a place with sharp struggles, and even the young minds of four or five-year-old children cannot fail to understand what war is and what peace is. However, Bakri Akko also makes us believe that here, the forces opposing war and defending peace are powerful, all imperialist aggressive conspiracies will be shattered, and Akko's wishes will surely be realized.

    在阿勒颇
    本报记者　蒋元椿
    我们住在阿勒颇市中心的一所旅馆里。早上醒来，忽然听到一声沉闷的爆炸声，很像是手榴弹的爆炸。下面街上有人在纷纷谈论。不久之后，一切又归于平静。
    后来我们才知道，这是反动分子在阿勒颇投掷炸弹，企图制造暴乱。这个地方接近土耳其，虽然阿拉伯复兴社会党和共产党在这里都有相当的影响和力量，但是亲帝国主义的反动势力却也很大。他们不满意现在叙利亚政府所奉行的和平中立政策，在帝国主义的策动和支持下企图实现所谓“阿勒颇独立”的阴谋。不过，由于叙利亚政府和军队采取了坚决的措施，这个阴谋被镇压下去了。从我们在阿勒颇两天的情况看来，这个城市生活安定如常，并没有像西方通讯社所宣传那样的混乱。
    帝国主义者看中阿勒颇这个地方来制造暴乱，是有原因的。阿勒颇有将近四十万人口，是叙利亚的第一大城，西通地中海边的港口拉塔基亚，东通幼发拉底河和吉齐拉地区，并且是重要的工农业中心。如果帝国主义的走狗们实现了他们的阴谋，叙利亚在政治上和经济上都将受到致命的打击。
    阿勒颇是一个很美的城市。站在阿勒颇西面的山岗上鸟瞰全市，你仿佛走进了安徒生童话中的仙境。城市中心耸立着一座古城堡，在它周围是鳞次栉比的房屋，清真寺的尖塔到处都在探头。这座十三世纪的古城堡建立在一座小土山上，四周围以二十公尺深、三十公尺宽的濠沟。土山的坡很陡，坡上还铺以石板。敌人要进攻它是很困难的。据说，在历史上，只有蒙古的铁木儿曾经在公元1401年攻下过这个城堡。在城堡里面还有一些建筑，不过由于战争和地震，有许多已遭破坏。在这里还发现了古代喜泰人的宫殿的遗址。由于经费困难，现在还没有发掘下去。
    城堡北端的大清真寺的二十公尺高的尖塔还保存得很好。拾级而上，在顶上可以看到阿勒颇和它周围的全景。从这里可以看到北面叙利亚和土耳其边境上的套鲁斯山脉。在西北面积雪的阿曼努斯山脚下的海港伊斯肯德伦和古城昂塔克雅，从前都是属于叙利亚的，后来却被法国硬割下来送给了土耳其。叙利亚人直到现在都还念念不忘这些地方。有些叙利亚地图仍然把这两个城画在叙利亚的版图之内。向东可以看到一片起伏的阿勒颇平原，幼发拉底河就在九十五公里以外。这一片由套鲁斯山脉和叙利亚中部高地所形成的平原，是叙利亚最肥沃的地方。叙利亚三分之一的小麦田，44％的大麦田，和37％的棉田，都集中在这里。不过，由于植棉得利较大，近来种棉的越来越多了。再往东去，就是吉齐拉地区。这一带从1950年以来，种植棉花的资本主义的农场有了很大的发展。其结果就是阿勒颇成了重要的棉花集散中心和棉纺织业的中心。
    据阿勒颇商会会长说，阿勒颇现在有五所较大的棉纺织厂，还有许多轧棉厂和打包厂。人造丝的纺织业也很发达，原料是从法国、西德、瑞典、意大利等国家进口的。有一所日产量九百吨的水泥厂，还准备建立一所日产量四百吨的新厂。此外还有一些制肥皂等的轻工业。阿勒颇的工业总产值占全国工业总产值的一半，有工人七万二千人（全国工人是十二万五千人）。阿勒颇的商业主要是棉花出口。出口量年达八万吨，一半输往法国。还有一部分输往英国。中国去年也购买了九千吨。现在帝国主义者对叙利亚实行经济封锁，法国和英国都停止购棉，这就给叙利亚的经济制造了困难。进口的主要是供农场使用的农业机器。
    叙利亚北部植棉事业的发展，对叙利亚经济的发展起着重要的杠杆作用。根据叙利亚国民经济部的材料，叙利亚1956年的国民收入为十七亿叙镑，其中农业占45％，畜牧业占20％，工商业及其他收入占35％（据另一个叙利亚官方材料，1954年工商业收入占13％）。国民收入增加的年率是5％—8％。叙利亚独立十年多以来，经济方面的发展是很大的。以1945年同1956年比较，首先是棉花生产从五千吨增加到了九万五千吨，相应的是棉纱由一千吨增加到一万吨，棉织品由一千五百万公尺增加到一亿公尺。由于棉花生产和贸易的发展，地主、农业和商业资本家有了钱，建筑业也就发达起来。在建筑业方面的投资已达一亿七千五百万叙镑。建筑所需要的水泥，也由1945年的八万吨增加到了1956年的三十五万吨。随着植棉业的发展，耕地面积扩大了，灌溉水利工程也有发展。伴随着的是其他农产品的增加。植物油（橄榄油、棉籽油）由1945年的零增加到1956年的一万吨。叙利亚从前需要进口小麦，现在小麦可以出口。1956年出口小麦三十五万吨，大麦五十万吨。由农业方面所积累的资本，一部分投入工业，使得工业生产也有了发展。因此，帝国主义封锁叙利亚的棉花出口，用心是非常狠毒的。
    在城堡附近，除了几所有名的清真寺以外，还有一个著名的市场，这里称为“索克”。这个市场由许多条甬道串联组成，甬道两边都是店铺。每条甬道上都有石头砌成的拱顶，拱顶上开有不大的孔，可以放进天光。由于光线不够，许多铺子都点着灯。每一条街都出售不同的商品，五花八门，应有尽有，供妇女用的丝织品似乎最多。街不宽，因此来来往往的人显得特别挤。顾客似乎主要是农民和从沙漠中来的牧民，许多人骑着小毛驴，蹄声得得地在人群中穿来插去，成为这个市场里惹人注意的特色。据说，这个市场所有街巷加起来有二十公里长，是阿拉伯世界中数一数二的大市场。一到春天，它的石头拱顶上面长出了青草，据说还可以在那上面放羊呢。
    环绕着古城堡，还有许多古迹，特别是许多古代的客栈。这是当阿勒颇还是东西贸易必经之地的时候，从中亚细亚或是波斯湾来的队商歇脚的地方。这里也有一个很有名的博物馆，收藏了曾经在叙利亚这块土地上生息过的古代民族的珍贵文物，这里都无法一一详叙了。
    阿勒颇市内有一条河，叫做客威克河。但是这条河发源于北面土耳其境内，被土耳其切断了水源，因此它几乎是没有水的。阿勒颇不能不办了一个引水工程，从九十五公里以外的幼发拉底河，用抽水机把水抽上一百多公尺高的河岸，用水管输送到阿勒颇，经过澄清、消毒以后供给城市应用。这个工程建得不坏，它是自己用电制造臭氧来作水的消毒剂的。
    我们还访问了阿勒颇的一些学校，主要是小学校。阿勒颇市政当局不仅在热闹市区，而且在离市中心较远的贫民区，也办了一些不坏的小学，设备都比较好。有些小学的房屋正在建筑。据说，这些为贫民儿童设立的小学，是由一个称为“一个披阿斯特（货币单位，一个叙镑的一百分之一）计划”依靠募捐而建成的。小学都是男女生分开上课的，不收学费，只收书籍费。
  叙利亚的小学教育是义务教育，一共是五年。初中教育四年，高中教育三年。小学生们都穿着黑色的制服，上衣的样子有点像高加索衬衣，看来都蛮有精神。
    我们从一所小学出来的时候，一个工人模样的中年男子，带着一个四、五岁的孩子在门口迎住了我们。孩子长得很漂亮，黑头发，圆脸，一对双眼皮的聪明的大眼。在父亲的推动下，孩子走上前来同我们每一个人握了手。他告诉我们他的名字叫巴克里·阿科，并且送给我们一张他的照片。他希望我们告诉全世界：“我们不要战争，我们要和平！”
    是的，这是一个严酷的时代，这是一个有着尖锐斗争的地方，连四、五岁的孩子的幼小的心灵里，都不能不懂得什么是战争，什么是和平。可是，巴克里·阿科也使我们相信，在这里，反对战争、保卫和平的力量是强大的，帝国主义的一切侵略阴谋终将被粉碎，而阿科的愿望必将实现。（附图片）
