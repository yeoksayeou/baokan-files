Xinhua News Agency, April 14th: Before leaving our country, Polish Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Józef Cyrankiewicz, accepted an invitation from the Central People's Broadcasting Station to deliver a radio address to the Chinese people. The full text is as follows: Dear Chinese Comrades:

　　Although I am speaking to you in a language unfamiliar to you, what I want to talk about are things that are close to us all, things concerning the people of our two countries. We have come here from a country thousands of kilometers away. Compared to your great China, our country is not large, and our population is not large either. This country—the People's Republic of Poland—like you, has been subjected to long periods of foreign oppression in its history. The Polish people have waged decades of long struggle for liberation. However, when the world was still dominated by capitalist countries, this struggle could not achieve lasting success. It was not until this last World War, as a result of the Soviet army crushing Hitlerite fascism, that Poland obtained lasting independence. The reason this independence is lasting is because the power in our country is in the hands of the working people advancing towards socialism under the leadership of the working-class party.

　　It is precisely this past and recent history that brings the people of our two countries closer together. In the past, we were far apart, both struggling to resist the oppression of various powers and striving for liberation, and today we are both building society, eliminating exploitation, and establishing new social relations along our own paths. Therefore, when your revolution was victorious, we immediately felt enriched by gaining the most valuable wealth, several hundred million brothers.

　　When we still felt very distant from each other, we could only know each other from history and geography textbooks. Today, we feel close to each other, and we are becoming closer and closer. This is not only because technological progress has shortened the distance, but primarily because we are advancing side by side towards a common goal. Nothing can separate us from each other; on the contrary, there are many things that unite us.

　　A common desire to strengthen the solidarity of the great socialist family striving for human liberation unites us; the common goal of a just social system—socialism—unites us. This social system has long been the ideal of mankind, and it was not realized until the success of the October Revolution forty years ago, which was the beginning of creatively applying Marxist-Leninist theory to building a new society. A common sympathy and support for all nations striving for independence and opposing colonialism in open or hidden forms unites us. The common cause of defending the highest interests of mankind, which are threatened by those who get rich by war and the blood of foreigners—defending peace—unites us.

　　These are strong and powerful ties, which transform the distance of thousands of kilometers into the mutual closeness of people whose hearts beat in unison. That is why the Polish people are proud of your reservoirs on the Huai River and the highway leading to Lhasa, just as the Polish people are proud of the "Nowa Huta" factory and the reconstruction of Warsaw. Therefore, in our minds, the strengthening of the international position of the People's China as one of the great powers is just like the elevation of our country's role on the international stage. Therefore, the opinions expressed by China, which plays a huge role in Asia and Europe, are given great importance in Poland, and the efforts of your government to safeguard world peace are fully supported by our people.

　　Friends and Comrades! Your great and wise leader, Comrade Mao Zedong, once said shortly after the liberation of China that this was only the first step in the Long March. Since then, the people of our two countries have taken several more steps forward. However, to achieve our goals, we still need to travel many roads. What conditions are needed to ensure that we can fortunately reach our destination in the shortest possible time and at the lowest possible cost? I think there are three conditions: First, we must build socialism together with the people, and we must be fully supported by the people who understand every step taken by the Party and the government; second, we must increasingly develop cooperation between socialist countries on the basis of mutual equality and respect for sovereignty, mutual assistance, and complete mutual understanding; third, we must work together to maintain and strengthen peace. The leaders of our Party and government have gained considerable experience in implementing these three conditions. Our country is using its own and the experience of other socialist countries, including your experience, to strive to make our policies more perfect.

　　During our stay here, we have personally witnessed some, unfortunately only some, of your achievements. In the past, we only saw these achievements in books and periodicals. Personal contact has also played a significant role, and this is primarily due to your Premier Zhou Enlai's two visits to Poland, where he was received very warmly. As the leader of a fraternal country so close to us and a statesman very familiar with our country, Comrade Zhou Enlai has been engaged in the struggle for social and national liberation for decades. Our delegation's visit here is not merely a simple visit, but also to strengthen ties, further mutual understanding, and deepen the consistency of our goals.

　　The Asian countries we visited before coming here warmly welcomed us, not only because of their feelings for the Polish people, but also because of our friendly relations with you—the People's Republic of China. China's prestige is very high in all countries that have recently gained independence. This further convinces us of the great value of your friendship and makes us even more grateful for the help you have given us in solving difficult and complex problems. I would like to express my gratitude on behalf of our delegation, our people, and our government to your people and government.

　　I want to assure you, friends and comrades, that in your cause for the benefit and happiness of your people, for the safety of mankind, for strengthening the freedom of all peoples, and for peace, we have been, are, and will continue to work together with you, with one heart and one mind.

　　I regret that we can only have a bird's-eye view of your great and beautiful country. Therefore, I hope to use the radio to congratulate hundreds of millions of friends from Lhasa to Andong, from the Mongolian pastures to the rice paddies of Hainan Island, and to wish you great victories and achievements on the road where the glorious Communist Party and wise leaders are guiding you forward.

　　Comrades of a country that is distant and yet so close! I wish you happiness and success.

### 没有东西能把中波人民隔开  我们将永远同心同德同努力  西伦凯维兹主席向中国人民广播

    没有东西能把中波人民隔开
    我们将永远同心同德同努力
    ——西伦凯维兹主席向中国人民广播——
    新华社14日讯　波兰部长会议主席约瑟夫·西伦凯维兹在离开我国国境以前，接受中央人民广播电台的邀请，向中国人民发表了广播演说。全文如下：亲爱的中国同志们：
    我虽然用你们所生疏的语言向你们讲话，但是我所要讲的却是我们都感到亲近的、共同的事情，有关我们两国人民的事情。我们从遥远的几千公里以外的国度来到这里，同你们的伟大中国比起来，我们的国家不算大，人口也不算多。这个国家——波兰人民共和国，同你们一样，在历史上受到过长时期的外来压迫。波兰人民进行过几十年的争取解放的长期斗争。但是，在世界上还都是资本主义国家的时候，这种斗争是不能获得持久的成功的。直到最近这一次世界大战以后，由于苏联军队粉碎了希特勒法西斯主义的结果，波兰才获得了持久的独立。这种独立之所以持久，是因为我国的政权是掌握在工人阶级政党领导下的向社会主义前进的劳动人民的手中。
    正是这种过去的和最近的历史，使我们两国人民接近起来。过去，我们相离很远，都为反抗各种强权的压迫和争取解放而斗争，而今天又都正在沿着自己的道路建设着社会，消除剥削，建立新的社会关系。因此，当你们的革命获得胜利的时候，我们立刻由于得到了最有价值的财富、得到了几亿兄弟而感到富足起来。
    当我们还在互相感到很遥远的时候，我们只能从历史和地理教科书上互相认识。今天，我们互相之间已经感到很亲近，并且越来越亲近起来。这不仅是因为人类的技术进步而缩短了距离，而首先是因为我们并肩向着共同的目标前进。没有什么东西能够把我们互相隔开，相反地，却有着许多东西把我们联结在一起。
    对于加强争取人类解放的各社会主义国家大家庭的团结一致的共同愿望，把我们联结在一起，正义的社会制度——社会主义这一共同目标把我们联结在一起。这种社会制度长久以来一直是人类的理想，直到四十年以前十月革命成功的时候才实现，而十月革命是把马克思列宁主义理论创造性地应用于建设新社会的开端。对于争取独立、反对公开或者隐蔽形式的殖民主义的各民族的共同的同情和支持，把我们联结在一起。保卫那受到靠战争和外国人的鲜血发财致富的人的威胁的人类最高利益——保卫和平的共同事业，把我们联结在一起。
    这些就是坚强和有力的联系，它把几千公里的距离改变成心脏跳动一致的人们的互相接近。这也就是为什么波兰人民为你们淮河上的水库和通向拉萨的公路而骄傲，正如同波兰人民为“诺瓦胡塔”工厂和为华沙的重建而骄傲一样。因此，在我们的心目中，作为大国之一的人民中国的国际地位的加强，正如我国在国际舞台上的作用提高一样。因此，作为在亚洲和欧洲起着巨大作用的中国所发表的意见，在波兰受到很大的重视，你们政府对于保卫世界和平所作的努力也受到我国人民的全力支持。
    朋友们和同志们！你们伟大的、英明的领袖毛泽东同志在中国解放以后不久曾经说过，这只不过是万里长征的第一步。自从那时候起，我们两国人民又向前走了好几步。但是，要达到我们的目的，却还需要走许多路程。为了使我们能够幸运地在尽可能短的时间内和付出尽可能少的代价达到目的地，需要些什么条件呢？我想有这样三个条件：第一，我们必须同人民一起建设社会主义，必须受到了解党和政府所采取的每一步骤的人民的全力支持；第二，我们要在互相平等和尊重主权，互相帮助和互相完全了解的基础上日益全面地发展社会主义各国之间的合作；第三，共同努力维护和加强和平。我们的党和政府的领导，在实行这三个条件的时候，已经获得了不少经验。我国正在利用自己的和其他社会主义国家的经验，其中也包括你们的经验，努力使我们的政策更加完善。
    我们在你们这里逗留期间，亲眼看到了你们的虽然是一部分的成就，只可惜这次逗留的时间非常短促。过去，我们只是在书上和报刊上看到这些成就。个人的接触也起了不少作用，这首先就是你们的总理周恩来同志两次访问波兰，并且在那里受到非常热诚的接待。作为对于我们是这样亲切的兄弟国家的领袖和对我国十分熟悉的政治家——周恩来同志，曾经从事了几十年的争取社会和民族解放的斗争。我们代表团到你们这里来，不仅是单纯的访问，同时也是为了加强联系，进一步互相了解，加深目的的一致性。
    在来你们这里以前我们所访问的亚洲国家，热诚地欢迎了我们，这不仅是由于他们对波兰人民的感情，同时也是由于我们同你们——中华人民共和国的友好关系，中国的威信在所有不久以前获得独立的国家中是非常之高的。这更加使我们深信你们的友谊的伟大价值和更加感谢你们在我们解决困难和复杂的问题的时候，所给予我们的帮助。我愿意代表我们的代表团、我国人民和政府向你们的人民和政府表示感谢。
    我愿向你们保证，朋友们和同志们，在你们为了你们人民的利益和幸福，为了人类的安全，为了加强各国人民的自由，为了和平而进行的事业中，我们过去、现在和将来都将同你们同心同德，共同努力。
    我感到惋惜的是，我们只能鸟瞰一下你们伟大的美丽的国家。因此，我希望通过广播，祝贺从拉萨到安东，从蒙古的牧场到海南岛的稻田的数亿朋友们，祝贺你们在光荣的共产党和英明的领袖们引导你们前进的道路上获得巨大的胜利和成就。
    遥远的同时又是这样亲近的国家的同志们！祝你们幸福和成功。
