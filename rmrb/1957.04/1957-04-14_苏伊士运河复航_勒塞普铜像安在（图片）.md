The Suez Canal has officially reopened, and merchant ships from various countries are once again traversing this vital waterway connecting Europe, Asia, and Africa, as they used to. However, as ships enter the canal entrance, the imposing statue of the colonialist Lesseps is no longer to be seen, as it has been toppled by the Egyptian people. Now, only the remnants of the statue's base are left for passing travelers to "commemorate."
