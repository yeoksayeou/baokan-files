Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch: The Chinese Film Workers' Representatives Meeting opened in Beijing today.

	This meeting was convened to discuss the establishment of the China Film Workers' Association.

	The famous Chinese film artist Cai Chusheng delivered the opening speech. He said: The China Film Workers' Association is a mass organization that unites film workers across the country. Its primary task is to unite, guide, and encourage film workers nationwide to integrate with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to serve the cause of socialist construction. The Association is also an academic organization, and one of its central tasks is to regularly exchange experiences through academic research and to help film creators learn and improve their artistic skills. Cai Chusheng pointed out that one of the reasons why the film industry still has serious shortcomings is that the atmosphere of academic research in the film industry is weak, and film art criticism is still very lacking. The existence of these weaknesses cannot fully adapt to the development of film art. In order to promote the further prosperity and development of our film industry, in addition to taking a series of administrative measures, the central issue is to attach importance to the research of film art and improve the ideological and artistic level of practitioners. Cai Chusheng said that the Association will also help promote friendly relations between Chinese film workers and film workers from other countries.

	Cai Chusheng finally said: On behalf of Chinese film workers, I express my sincere hope to the film workers in Taiwan: I hope that they will, in the spirit of patriotism and kinship, respond to the call of the motherland for the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, make contributions to the peaceful liberation of Taiwan, and strive to return to the embrace of the motherland and the film work positions of the people as soon as possible.

	Wang Yang, a member of the preparatory committee of the China Film Workers' Association, read the draft of the Association's charter at the meeting, asking the representatives to study it.

	The presidium of the representatives' meeting consisted of thirty-three people, including Cai Chusheng, Zheng Junli, Jin Yan, Ying Yunwei, Cheng Yin, Chen Liting, Sha Meng, Chen Huangmei, Situ Huimin, Shui Hua, and Meng Junmou.

	Three hundred and fifty representatives of film workers from all over the country attended the meeting. Xia Meng and other four representatives of Hong Kong film award winners who came to Beijing to attend the Outstanding Film Awards Ceremony also participated in the meeting.

    商讨成立电影工作者联谊会
    电影工作者代表会议开幕
    据新华社11日讯　中国电影工作者代表会议今日在北京开幕。
    这次会议是为了商讨成立中国电影工作者联谊会而召开的。
    中国著名的电影艺术家蔡楚生致开会词。他说：中国电影工作者联谊会是一个团结全国电影工作者的群众性的组织，它的首要任务是团结、引导和鼓励全国的电影工作者与工农兵相结合，为社会主义建设事业服务。联谊会又是一个学术性的组织，它的中心工作之一就是经常以学术研究的方式来交流经验，并帮助电影创作人员进行学习、提高艺术修养。蔡楚生指出，电影事业所以还存在严重缺点的原因之一，是电影界学术研究的气氛薄弱，电影艺术评论工作还很缺乏，这些弱点的存在完全不能适应电影艺术的发展情况。为了促使我们的电影事业进一步繁荣、发展，除采取一系列行政措施之外，中心问题就是把电影艺术的研究工作重视起来，提高从业人员的思想、艺术水平。蔡楚生说，联谊会也将有助于我国电影工作者和各国电影工作者之间的友好联系。
    蔡楚生最后说：我代表我国电影工作者向现在在台湾的电影工作者表示恳切的希望：希望他们本着爱国一家的精神，响应祖国和平解放台湾的号召，为和平解放台湾立功，争取早日回到祖国的怀抱和人民的电影工作岗位上来。
    中国电影工作者联谊会筹备委员会委员汪洋在会上宣读了联谊会的章程草案，要求代表进行研究。
    代表会议主席团由蔡楚生、郑君里、金焰、应云卫、成荫、陈鲤庭、沙蒙、陈荒煤、司徒慧敏、水华、孟君谋等三十三人组成。
    出席会议的有全国各地电影工作者代表三百五十人。来北京出席优秀影片授奖大会的香港影片得奖者代表夏梦等四人也参加了会议。
