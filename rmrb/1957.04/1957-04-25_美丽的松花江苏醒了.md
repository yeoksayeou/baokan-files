The Beautiful Songhua River Awakes

	In April, the southern part of our motherland is a season of warbling orioles and lush growth, where various trees blossom. On the banks of the beautiful Songhua River, the ice and snow have just melted, the fertile soil bares its chest, gleaming with a black oily sheen. The withered yellow weeds and wildflowers have decayed, emitting a strong fragrance that blends the earth and grass. Farmers emerge from their warm houses where they have been cooped up all winter, leading their oxen and mules to plow, fertilize, and sow spring wheat on the earth, bathed in the warm, brilliant sunshine. Fishermen are mending and drying their nets, preparing to catch the freshest fish on the first day the river opens. The red-crowned, white-feathered cranes fly freely in the azure blue sky above the river. On April 18th and 19th, the Songhua River, which had been sleeping soundly for more than five months, awoke like a maiden, and the entire river's ice cover was about to break open.

	On April 20th, after the last batch of ice floes drifted away, more than a hundred ships docked in the shipyard sailed out in a mighty fleet, arrayed on the wide waters of the Harbin and Sankeshu wharves. The wharves were exceptionally busy. Trucks and carts came and went incessantly, stevedores were busy unloading goods, and cargo piled up like mountains. Giant cranes and derricks, stretching out their long arms, extended and retracted, loading tons upon tons of industrial coal, building materials, new agricultural implements for rural use, chemical fertilizers, and a wide variety of daily necessities onto the ships. At twelve o'clock noon on this day, the "Bei'an" passenger-cargo ship, fully loaded with passengers and goods, hoisted its red navigation flag for the first time, and amidst the deafening sound of the ship's long whistle, it left the dock, its red paddles stirring up waves in the river, as it led the way and slowly sailed upstream. A new year of inland river shipping has begun.

	This year, many small-scale industries are being built in towns along the river; the reclamation tasks in the Luobei area are even more arduous; the Daxing'anling forest area will increase its forest resource survey tasks; drilling has begun at the dam site for the hydropower station on the Heilongjiang River; and the project to build dikes to control parts of the Songhua River will also begin soon.... All of this foretells that the Songhua River's shipping tasks will be even heavier.

    美丽的松花江苏醒了
    4月，祖国的南方正是莺飞草长、杂树生花的季节，而美丽的松花江两岸，刚刚冰化雪消，沃土裸露出胸脯，闪出黑油油的光；枯黄的杂草和野花腐烂了，散发出大地和草混合着的强烈的芳香。农民们走出闷了一冬的暖屋，牵着耕牛、骡马，在和煦、绚烂的阳光普照着的大地上翻耕，施肥，播种春小麦。渔民们正在补修和晾晒鱼网，要在开江的第一天打捕鲜嫩的鱼。那红头顶、白羽毛的仙鹤，在瓦蓝瓦蓝的江的上空自由飞翔。4月18、19日，酣睡五个多月的松花江，像一位少女苏醒了，满江的冰层要破裂开江了。
    4月20日，当最后一批冰排流失之后，停泊在船坞里的百余条船舶，浩浩荡荡地驶出了船坞，陈列在哈尔滨和三棵树码头宽阔的水面上。码头上倍加繁忙。汽车、大车往来不断，卸装工人忙着卸货，货物堆积如山。巨人似的起重机和吊车，伸开长臂，一伸一缩地，把成吨成吨的工业用煤、建筑材料、农村用的新式农具、化学肥料、种类繁多的生活必需品，都装满了轮船。这天中午十二时，满载着旅客和货物的“北安”号客货轮，首次升上了红色的航旗，在震耳欲聋的汽笛长鸣声中，离开了码头，红色的轮板激起了江中的水浪，它领先地、缓缓地向上游驶去。新的一年内河航运又开始了。
    今年，沿江城镇兴建很多小型工业；萝北地区垦荒任务也更加繁重；大兴安岭林区增加林业资源调查任务；黑龙江上水电站坝址开始了钻探；治理松花江部分修筑江堤工程也即将开始……。这一切预告着松花江航运任务更加繁重。
