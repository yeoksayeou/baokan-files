Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, March 31st. The first batch of prawns for this year, totaling more than 13,000 jin, arrived in Tianjin this morning.

This batch of prawns was caught by two fishing trawlers dispatched by the Tianjin Municipal Marine Fishing Company, which ventured beyond the Bohai Bay to the Yellow Sea to meet the shrimp shoals. According to one captain, they encountered snow three times and gale-force winds of level six to seven twice during more than ten days of operations at sea. Although the prawns appeared a few days earlier this year than last year, the output is still not high due to the cold weather.

A large number of fishing boats from the fisheries production cooperatives of Tianjin's Tanggu fishing port, famous for its prawn production, are successively heading out to sea to participate in the prawn fishing season.

    天津第一批对虾上市
    新华社天津31日电　今年的第一批对虾一万三千多斤，已在今天早晨运到天津。
    这批对虾是天津市海洋捕捞公司派出的两对渔轮，越过渤海湾到黄海海面去迎接虾群捕获来的。据一位船长谈，他们在海上作业了十多天遇到三次雪、两次六——七级大风，今年对虾露面虽比去年早几天，但因天寒，目前产量还不算多。
    以出产对虾著名的天津塘沽渔港，渔业生产合作社的大批渔船，正陆续出海投入虾汛生产。
