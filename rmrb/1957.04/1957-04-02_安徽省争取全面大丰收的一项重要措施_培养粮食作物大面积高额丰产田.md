    An Important Measure for Anhui Province to Strive for an All-Round Bumper Harvest
    Cultivating Large-Area, High-Yield Model Fields for Grain Crops
    (Our Hefei dispatch, April 1st) (Our reporter Yu Ming reports): Anhui Province is taking an important measure to promote an all-round bumper harvest in agriculture this year – cultivating large-area, high-yield models for grain crops. Recently, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of rural work ministers from prefectural and some county committees to study this work.
    In recent years, Anhui Province has achieved considerable success in expanding the multiple cropping index and overcoming extensive farming habits. To strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest in the future, in addition to continuing to expand the multiple cropping index, increasing yield per unit area is an important way to increase production. According to Anhui Province's experience over the past few years, the best way to increase yield per unit area is to cultivate high-yield models to drive general improvement. The high-yield models that have appeared in Anhui Province in the past have shown that the potential for increasing yield per unit area is significant. However, because those high-yield models were small in area and scattered, their economic impact was not significant. In order to promote the general increase of grain crop yield per unit area in various places, Anhui Province has decided this year to cultivate large-area, contiguous high-yield models in accordance with local conditions.
    This year, Anhui Province focuses on cultivating large-area, high-yield models on the main grain crops – wheat in northern Anhui and rice along the Yangtze River and in southern Anhui. There are many favorable conditions for striving for large-area, high-yield wheat in northern Anhui this year: the sowing of wheat in northern Anhui last year was relatively timely, and 70% of the seeds were improved varieties; the rainfall and snowfall last winter and this spring were relatively abundant, and wheat is generally growing well. The favorable conditions for striving for high-yield rice on both sides of the Yangtze River and in hilly areas are: double-cropping rice was promoted on a larger area last year, and experience was gained, and the masses are mostly able to master the season for planting double-cropping rice; appropriate arrangements and preparations have been made this year in terms of crop stubble, labor, livestock, and seeds. At present, agricultural production cooperatives throughout Anhui Province have been rectified, and the management and democratic style of cadres have been improved, providing more favorable conditions for ensuring large-area, high-yield production.
    In order to strengthen the leadership of measures to cultivate large-area, high-yield fields from all aspects, Anhui Province will launch a publicity campaign throughout the province to strive for large-area, high-yield production, so that the broad masses of cadres and people recognize its great significance and give greater play to their production enthusiasm. At the same time, Anhui Province has strengthened the leadership and material preparation for this work. Many leading cadres of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee and the Fuyang and Bengbu Prefectural Party Committees have gone to various counties to concurrently serve as county party secretaries, and responsible cadres of various counties will go to the selected high-yield areas to conduct specific leadership. The province has decided to allocate a large number of fast-acting fertilizers and pesticides for use in wheat high-yield fields, and various places have also strengthened field management and topdressing with fertilizers. In order to solve the difficulties of farmers in the disaster areas of northern Anhui in spring plowing and wheat field management, the province has allocated more than 600 standard-unit tractors for centralized use in northern Anhui, and appropriately increased the grain supply to farmers in the disaster areas. Huang Yan, secretary of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee, also led responsible cadres from agriculture, industry, commerce, grain and other departments, and supply and marketing cooperatives to northern Anhui to specifically inspect and help farmers in the disaster areas to develop sideline production. For rice areas, the province has allocated funds to support agricultural production cooperatives in various places to purchase more than 40,000 head of draft cattle to solve the problem of insufficient livestock power. In addition to vigorously relying on the masses to accumulate fertilizer, the province is also prepared to allocate fertilizer to support areas lacking fertilizer for double-cropping rice.
    The determination and various measures of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee and Prefectural Party Committees to strive for large-area, high-yield production have greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of cadres and people in various counties. Now, the high-yield fields reported by various counties in northern Anhui have reached more than one million mu; the high-yield rice fields reported by various counties along the Yangtze River and in hilly areas have also reached hundreds of thousands of mu. The average yield of wheat in high-yield fields in various counties in northern Anhui is 250 to 300 jin per mu, which is 50% to 100% higher than in previous years. In the rice area along the Yangtze River, it is generally required that each mu of high-yield field produce more than 1,000 jin of grain, and hilly areas also plan to cultivate high-yield fields with a single-crop yield of 800 jin. These high-yield fields are generally tens of thousands of mu in a continuous area. The farmers responsible for cultivating high-yield fields in various counties will launch labor competitions between counties, townships, and cooperatives, and will drive the farmers of the province through this competition to strive for a comprehensive bumper harvest in agriculture this year.

It is estimated that the average yield of wheat is 190 jin per mu, and the yield in the high-yield fields is 290 jin per mu. This is the cooperative members threshing wheat.

    安徽省争取全面大丰收的一项重要措施
    培养粮食作物大面积高额丰产田
    本报合肥1日电　本报记者于明报道：安徽省今年采取推动农业全面大丰收的一项重要措施——培养粮食作物大面积的高额丰产典型。最近，中共安徽省委召集地委和部分县委的农村工作部长开会研究了这项工作。
    最近几年来，安徽省在扩大复种指数和克服耕作中的粗放习惯方面，收到了不少成效；今后争取全面大丰收，除了继续扩大复种指数外，提高单位面积产量是增产的一条重要途径。根据安徽省几年来的经验，提高单位面积产量的最好办法，就是培养高额丰产典型，推动一般。安徽省过去出现的高额丰产典型，说明了提高单位面积产量的潜力很大；但是那些丰产典型因为面积较小而又零散，经济作用不显著。为了推动各地普遍提高粮食作物单位面积产量，安徽省今年决定因地制宜地培养大面积的、连片的高额丰产典型。
    安徽省今年培养大面积高额丰产典型的重点，放在主要粮食作物——淮北的小麦和沿江、淮南的水稻上。今年争取淮北小麦大面积高额丰产有许多有利条件：去年淮北小麦播种比较适时，有70％的种子是优良品种；去冬今春的雨雪比较充足，小麦一般生长得好。在长江两岸和丘陵地区的水稻，争取高额丰产的有利条件是：去年较大面积地推广了双季稻，取得了经验，群众大部分已经能够掌握种植双季稻的季节；今年在作物茬口、劳动力、畜力、种籽等方面，都已作了适当安排和准备。目前，安徽全省农业生产合作社都经过了整顿，经营管理工作和干部的民主作风都有了改进，为保证大面积高额丰产提供了更为有利的条件。
    为了从各方面加强对培养大面积高额丰产田的措施的领导，安徽全省范围内将开展一个争取大面积高额丰产的宣传运动，使广大干部和群众认识它的重大意义，发挥更大的生产积极性。同时，安徽省加强了这一工作的领导力量和物质的准备。中共安徽省委和阜阳、蚌埠地委的许多负责干部已到各县兼任县委书记，各县的负责干部将分别到各选定的高额丰产片内进行具体领导。省里已决定调拨大批速效肥和农药械，在小麦丰产田内施用，各地也同时加强了田间管理工作和追施了肥料。为了解决淮北灾区农民在春耕中和小麦田间管理方面的困难，省里已把六百多个标准台拖拉机拨给淮北集中使用，并适当增加了对灾区农民的粮食供应。安徽省委书记黄岩还带领农业、工业、商业、粮食等部门和供销合作社的负责干部，到淮北具体检查和帮助灾区农民开展副业生产。对水稻地区，省里已经拨款支持各地农业生产合作社购买耕畜四万多头，以解决畜力不足的问题。对双季稻所需要的肥料，除大力依靠群众积肥外，省里也准备调拨肥料支援缺肥的地区。
    安徽省委和地委争取大面积高额丰产的决心和各种措施，大大鼓舞了各县干部和群众的积极性。现在淮北各县自报要培养的高额丰产田，已达一百万亩以上；长江沿岸和丘陵区各县自报要培养的水稻丰产田也达数十万亩。淮北各县争取高额丰产田平均每亩产麦二百五十斤到三百斤，要比往年提高二分之一到一倍。在长江沿岸水稻区，一般要求每亩丰产田产粮食千斤以上，丘陵地区也计划培养单产八百斤的高额丰产田。这些高额丰产田一般都是数万亩连成一片。各县负责培养高额丰产田的农民，将展开县与县、乡与乡、社与社之间的劳动竞赛，并将通过这一竞赛，带动全省农民，争取今年农业的全面大丰收。（附图片）
