Since the Party Central Committee put forward the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," some thriving phenomena have emerged in my country's science, literature, and art. This phenomenon is what intellectuals perceive as the scenery of "early spring."

It goes without saying that comparing this phenomenon to "early spring" means that even now, we cannot see the beautiful scenery of myriad colors and fragrant birds and flowers. What we can see are only flower buds, and what we can hear is only the prelude to chirping.

The policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" has been put forward for more than half a year. Why does it still give people a sense of "early spring"? It cannot be said that there is no reason for this. The reason lies in what each person sees differently. In my opinion, the main reason is that it has not been let loose enough.

Recently, many intellectuals have published poetic remarks, such as "early spring is slightly cold," "the spring breeze does not pass through the Jade Gate Pass," etc., which fully reflect that some places or departments still have "spring cold," and other places or departments have not even felt the spring breeze. If these poetic words were directly and frankly stated, it would mean that the comrades in charge of cultural and academic leadership in some places or departments still do not dare to let go, or even dare not let go a little, a tiny bit.

Everyone knows that intellectuals, especially senior intellectuals, are most sensitive to changes in the climate. Whether they chirp or not depends on whether they are released. The extent to which they chirp depends on the extent to which they are released. Some people say: "We chirp greatly if released greatly, chirp slightly if released slightly, and do not chirp if not released."

Of course, the slogan of letting go has been shouted out, but perhaps the leading comrades in certain places or departments are shouting but not letting go, letting go but not being broad-minded. Therefore, some people say: "The thunder is loud, but the raindrops are small"; others say: "Only hear the sound of footsteps upstairs, but see no one coming down." If these enigmatic words are translated, it means that "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" is still stuck at the level of slogans in some places or departments.

Precisely because there is thunder but no rain, sound but no people, intellectuals are still in the stage of testing the waters. For example, they are still guessing whether this is genuine release or fake release. If it is genuine release, how much will be released? Will it be taken back after release? Is release a means or an end? Is it to promote cultural and academic prosperity or to dig out thoughts and rectify people? And which issues can be debated and which issues cannot be debated? These questions have all been raised.

The raising of these questions reflects that intellectuals still have concerns. I heard an old professor say: "To let go, we must first put down the intellectuals' concerns." Another old professor said: "To let go, we must first be open and honest with each other and put each other at ease. If you don't trust me and I don't trust you, we can't let go or chirp, no matter what." These are all frank words.

Because intellectuals have concerns, when the leading comrades of certain departments shout but do not let go, let go but are not broad-minded, intellectuals remain silent and do not chirp, chirp but do not contend. To let a hundred flowers bloom, it is necessary to "rain"; to let a hundred schools of thought contend, the leading comrades of all places or departments must "come downstairs."

It is probably a fact that some individual leading comrades in certain places or departments have some conservative ideas. They are afraid that letting go will cause ideological confusion that cannot be controlled. For the sake of prudence, they always let go slowly, let go a little, or even do not let go. They have no experience with letting go and are afraid of making mistakes if they let go too much or too quickly. Therefore, they always wait and see when it comes to the issue of letting go. In short, they are not enthusiastic enough. This is why we are still discussing the issue of letting go.

I don't know how other departments are letting go, but in the field of history, the flowers are not blooming enough. Recently, Professor Xiang Da said at a department meeting of the Department of History at Peking University: "It has been more than half a year since 'Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend' was shouted, but only five flowers have bloomed in the field of history: one is the issue of periodization of ancient history, one is the issue of periodization of modern history, one is the issue of the budding of capitalism, one is the issue of land systems, and one is the issue of peasant wars. Is it possible that there are only these five flowers in history? Of course, there are more than these five flowers. Why can't other flowers bloom?" He pointed out that famous flowers within the scope of history, such as Sanskrit and Persian, have not bloomed. In addition, historians who study world history have more opinions.

Professor Xiang Da's words are in line with the actual situation. In recent years, the issues that have been frequently discussed in our historical journals are the above-mentioned issues. These issues should be discussed, but as Professor Xiang Da said, the important issues worthy of discussion in history are by no means limited to these five. In addition to these five issues, there are countless large and small issues that should be discussed but have not been raised for discussion. What is the reason for this? It should be admitted that this is the fault of dogmatism.

In recent years, there seems to be such a trend: it seems that Marxist history can only discuss some large, empty, and vague issues of principle. Therefore, in our historical journals, there are lengthy articles of 30,000 to 40,000 words, in which economics, politics, and culture are always a complete set. It seems that the larger the topic, the longer the article, and the more comprehensive the content, the better. If someone studies a smaller issue based on concrete historical data in a realistic manner, some people may think that it is not Marxist enough, but in fact, it is not dogmatic enough.

According to my understanding, Marxist history is to study some major issues in history, to find out the dominant characteristics and tendencies of each historical era through the study of some major issues, and to find out the objective laws of historical development. But a big problem is often composed of many small problems. Without studying small problems, we cannot solve big problems. On this point, I completely agree with what President Guo Moruo said in his letter to the students of the Department of History at Peking University: "Problems have sizes. Big problems should be studied, and small problems and very small problems should also be studied." Moreover, the study of big problems should start with the many small problems that make up the big problems. The solution of big problems is the result of the solution of many small problems. Only in this way can more and more beautiful flowers bloom in the garden of history.

To open up an era of cultural and academic prosperity, we must oppose dogmatism. Gu Yanwu, a pioneer of academic studies in the Qing Dynasty, once opposed the dogmatism of the Ming and Qing dynasties. He said: "In the past, Qing talk discussed Lao Zhuang, but today's Qing talk discusses Confucius and Mencius." He also said that the Qing talkers at that time "did not examine the classics of the former kings, nor did they summarize the affairs of the present world," and "replaced the practical learning of self-cultivation and governance with empty talk about enlightening the mind and seeing one's nature." Today's dogmatists are certainly different from the dogmatists of the Ming and Qing dynasties. They do not talk about Lao Zhuang, nor do they talk about Confucius and Mencius, but talk about Marxist phrases. They ignore the content of historical materials, do not combine them with the characteristics of Chinese history, and replace the analysis of specific historical facts with Marxist-Leninist formulas. If such dogmatism is not overthrown, it will be a major obstacle to "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend." But it must be added that opposing dogmatism is not opposing Marxism, but to creatively develop Marxism; it is not to let culture and academia go back to the old path, but to open up a new era of culture and academia on a new historical basis.

In order to better promote the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" put forward by the Party Central Committee, it is necessary to conscientiously implement the spirit of Chairman Mao's speech at the enlarged meeting of the Supreme State Conference. To let go, we must let go greatly.

### 为什么会有“早春”之感？

    为什么会有“早春”之感？
    翦伯赞
    自从党中央提出“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针以来，在我国科学、文学、艺术各方面都出现了一些欣欣向荣的现象。这种现象，在知识分子的感应中就是所谓“早春”的景色。
    不言而喻，把这种现象比作“早春”就是意味着一直到现在还看不到万紫千红、鸟语花香的美景，能够看到的只是花的蓓蕾，能够听到的只是鸣的前奏。
    “百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针已经提出半年多了，为什么至今还令人有“早春”之感？这不能说没有原因，原因何在，各人所见不同，我的看法，主要的是放得不够。
    近来许多知识分子发表了带有诗意的谈话，如像“早春微寒”“春风不度玉门关”等等，充分地反映出有些地方或部门还有“春寒”，另外一些地方或部门连春风也没有吹到。如果把这些带有诗意言语直接了当地说出来，就是有些地方或部门的文化学术领导同志直到现在还是不敢大放，甚至不敢小放、小小放。
    大家都知道，知识分子、特别是高级知识分子，对于气候的变化最为敏感，他们鸣不鸣要看放不放，鸣到什么程度要看放到什么程度。有人说：“我们是大放则大鸣，小放则小鸣，不放则不鸣。”
    当然，放的口号是喊出来了，但是可能某些地方或部门的领导同志是喊而不放，放而不宽。因此，有人说：“雷声大、雨点小”；也有人说：“只听楼梯响，不见人下来”。如果把这些谜的言语翻译出来，就是“百花齐放、百家争鸣”至今在某些地方或某些部门还是停留在口号上。
    正因打雷而不下雨，闻声而不见人，所以直到现在知识分子还在摸底的阶段。例如，他们还在揣测，这是真放还是假放。如果是真放，放多少，放了以后还收不收，放是手段还是目的，是为了繁荣文化学术还是为挖思想、整人，以及哪些问题能争鸣，哪些问题不能争鸣等等，这些问题都提出来了。
    这些问题的提出，反映了知识分子还有顾虑。我听到一位老教授说：“要放先要放下知识分子的顾虑。”另一位老教授说：“要放，首先要开诚相见，彼此放心，如果你不放心我，我不放心你，无论如何也放不开，鸣不起来。”这些都是开诚相见的话。
    由于知识分子有顾虑，当某些部门的领导同志喊而不放，放而不宽的时候，知识分子也就默而不鸣，鸣而不争。要百花齐放，必须“下雨”；要百家争鸣，必须各地方或部门的领导同志“下楼”。
    某些地方或部门的个别领导同志有一些保守思想，可能是事实。他们怕放开了会造成思想混乱不可收拾。为了慎重起见，他们总是慢放、小放，乃至不放。他们对放没有经验，怕放大了放快了会犯错误，因此，对放的问题总是等等看看，总之，不够热心。这就是为什么到现在还在讨论放的问题。
    别的部门放得怎样，我不知道，在历史学这个园地里的花是开得不够多的。最近向达教授在北京大学历史系系务会议上曾经说：“百花齐放、百家争鸣已经喊了半年多了，历史学方面至今只开五朵花，一朵是古代史分期问题，一朵是近代史分期问题，一朵是资本主义萌芽问题，一朵是土地制度问题，一朵是农民战争问题，难道历史学上就只有这五朵花吗？当然不止这五朵花，为什么其他的花就开不出来呢？”他举出梵文、波斯文这些历史学范围以内的名花都没有开出来。此外，研究世界史的史学家，意见更多。
    向达教授的这一段话是符合实际情况的。近年来，在我们历史学刊物上经常讨论的就是上述的几个问题。这几个问题是应该讨论的，但正像向达教授所说的，历史学上值得讨论的重要问题无论如何不止这五个，在这五个问题之外，还有无数大大小小的问题，都应该讨论而没有提出来讨论。这是什么原因呢？应该承认这是教条主义作怪。
    近年来似乎有这样一种风气，好像马克思主义的历史学只能讨论一些大而无当的空空洞洞的原则性问题，因而在我们历史学的刊物上，连篇累牍都是长达三万到四万字的大块文章，在这些文章中，总是经济政治文化一全套。好像题目愈大愈好，文章愈长愈好，内容愈全愈好。如果有人根据具体的史料实事求是地研究一个较小的问题，可能就有人认为不够马克思主义，其实是不够教条主义。
    照我的理解，马克思主义的历史学是要研究历史上的一些大问题，是要通过一些大问题的研究找出各个历史时代的主导的特征和倾向，找出历史发展的客观规律性。但是一个大问题往往是许多小问题所构成，不研究小问题，就不能解决大问题。关于这一点我完全同意郭沫若院长在写给北京大学历史系学生的信中所说的：“问题有大小，大问题要研究，小问题小小问题也要研究。”而且，研究大问题要从构成这个大问题的许多小问题入手，大问题的解决，是许多小问题解决之结果。只有这样，在历史学的花园里才能开出更多的更美的花朵。
    要开辟一个文化学术的繁荣时代，必须反对教条主义。清代学术的先驱者顾炎武就曾经反对过明清之际的教条主义。他说：“昔之清谈谈老庄，今之清谈谈孔孟。”又说，当时的清谈者“不考先王之典，不综当世之务，”“以明心见性之空谈，代修己治人之实学。”今天的教条主义者和明清之际的教条主义者当然有所不同，他们不谈老庄，也不谈孔孟，而是谈马克思主义的辞句。他们不管史料的内容，不结合中国历史的特点，以马克思列宁主义的公式，代具体史实的分析。像这样的教条主义如果不反掉，对于“百花齐放，百家争鸣”就是一个很大的障碍。但是必须补充一句，反对教条主义不是反对马克思主义，而是要创造性地发展马克思主义；不是让文化学术走回旧路，而是要在新的历史基础上开辟一个文化学术的新时代。
    为了更好地推动党中央提出的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，只有认真地贯彻毛主席在最高国务会议扩大会议上的讲话的精神。要放，要大放。
