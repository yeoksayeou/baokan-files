Agricultural Proverbs (Continuation Six)
	Collected by Su Keqin
	Methods of hoeing: "Selecting seedlings is like applying fertilizer" (when setting seedlings, choose the largest and strongest to keep). "If you want the crops to grow evenly, pay attention to hoeing." "Thin out the dense, keep the sparse, and keep the big ones if neither sparse nor dense." "Break up the clods, pick up the stones, add white beans in the cracks." "Hoe shallow when plants are big, hoe deep when plants are small, and hoe evenly when they are neither big nor small." "Sorghum and millet, cover with your hand" (referring to sorghum and millet, when hoeing the first time, one hand hoes and the other hand works together to thin the seedlings and pull weeds). "First hoeing is for seedlings (setting seedlings), second hoeing is for weeds (weeding). The third hoeing covers the whole field (loosening the soil)." "First hoeing is good, second hoeing is for weeds." "Half-exposed and half-hidden, hoe once" (referring to when millet starts to emerge its ears, it still needs to be hoeed once). "Hoe once after removing the leaves (farmers traditionally remove the leaves from the middle and lower part of the sorghum stalk when the sorghum is pregnant with ears), so the sorghum grains will be round." "Loosen the surface soil at the Beginning of Autumn, which is equal to plowing once after the autumn harvest." "Live plowing for sorghum, dead plowing for millet" (referring to the soil being compacted by rain after hoeing is called dead plowing, and soil not compacted by rain is called live plowing; here it means live plowing is more suitable for sorghum and dead plowing for millet). "Hoe the fields in drought, water the gardens in flood" (referring to hoeing the fields in drought has a drought-resistant effect, and flooding is harmful to vegetables; watering with well water can relieve the flooding). "Hoe millet in drought, hoe jute in flood, and hoe sesame after rain." "Pinch off the crazy branches of cotton, and strip off the small crazy branches (small crazy branches)."
	Pay attention to disaster prevention: "Not afraid of small seedlings, but afraid of mole crickets biting." "Jaundice disease halves the harvest, black jaundice disease rots to the roots" (referring to wheat suffering from jaundice disease will reduce production, and wheat suffering from black jaundice disease will have no harvest). "The wind blows a large area, the hail hits a line." "Dense sorghum and sparse millet are easily blown down" (referring to sorghum with dense stalks and millet with sparse stalks being easily blown down in strong winds). "Wheat fears the wind during pregnancy (referring to when wheat is budding)." "Geese passing after the eighteenth day, a hard frost will fall." "Autumn freezing of high-lying land, spring freezing of low-lying land."

    苏克勤搜集
    锄地的方法：“选苗如上粪”（指定苗时要拣大棵的壮的留下）“要想庄稼长的齐，耪地要注意”。“稀留稠，稠留稀，不稀不稠留大的”。“打坷垃，拾石头，缝儿里加白豆”。 “大耪浅，小耪深，不大不小要耪均”。“高粱谷，拿手捂”（指高粱、谷子锄头遍时，要一个手锄，一个手配合间苗、拔草）。“头遍苗儿（指定苗）二遍草（指锄草）。三遍满地跑（指松土）”。“头遍好，二遍草”。“半吐半咽耪一遍”（指当谷子开始吐穗时，还要锄一遍）。“打了叶子（农民习惯当高粱孕穗的时候，要把高粱秆中下部的叶子去掉）耪一遍，高粱颗粒眼瞪圆”。“立秋扒破皮，秋后顶一犁”。“活番高粱死番谷”（锄地后，又被雨淋实的叫死番，没被雨淋实的叫活番，这里指活番锄高粱、死番锄谷较为适宜）“旱耪田，涝浇园”（指旱时锄田有防旱的作用，涝雨对蔬菜有害，浇了井水可以解过）。“旱耪黍子涝耪麻，下过了雨耪芝麻”。“棉花拿疯杈，耳子（小的疯杈）要捋光”。
