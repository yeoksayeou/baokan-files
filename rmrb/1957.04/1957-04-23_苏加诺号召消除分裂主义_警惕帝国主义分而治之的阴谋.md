    苏加诺号召消除分裂主义
    警惕帝国主义分而治之的阴谋
    新华社雅加达22日电　据安塔拉通讯社巴塘消息：苏加诺总统20日在巴厘岛的巴塘举行的“国内和平”大会上，要求印度尼西亚人民警惕帝国主义的“分而治之”的政策。
    苏加诺总统号召人民消除种族情绪和分裂主义，以拯救印度尼西亚共和国。
    苏加诺总统说，帝国主义者使用两种武器来不断企图粉碎印度尼西亚共和国：第一种是有形的武器，例如炸弹、枪炮和飞机等等；第二种是渗透到人民的思想和生活中的煽动活动。苏加诺总统说，这种活动引起了印度尼西亚人当中的不团结。
    苏加诺总统说，建设国家和收复西伊里安只有在紧密的民族团结的基础上才能实现，而印度尼西亚共和国是在这个基础上宣告成立的。
