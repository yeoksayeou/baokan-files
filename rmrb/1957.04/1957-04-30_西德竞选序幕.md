The West German election date has been set for September 15th. On this day, thirty million West German voters will re-elect the four hundred-plus members of the West German Federal Parliament. The majority party of the newly elected Third Federal Parliament will form the new West German cabinet.

The prelude to the West German election has begun. Various political parties have held gatherings or representative conferences to plan election strategies and propose election slogans. The German Communist Party has been banned, and the election is mainly between the Christian Democratic Union, the Free Democratic Party, and the Social Democratic Party.

Currently, the most debated issues in West Germany are: foreign policy and the issue of German reunification; economic policy and the issue of prices and wages; and the issue of rearmament. The three major West German parties have different opinions on these issues, and the election will revolve around the above three central issues.

	Foreign Policy and the German Reunification Issue

On the issue of foreign policy and German reunification, the government of the Christian Democratic Union, led by Adenauer, resolutely followed the United States, made West Germany a member of the aggressive North Atlantic military bloc, assumed military obligations, and deepened the division of Germany. The West German government stubbornly opposed negotiation, refused to establish any contact with the German Democratic Republic, and demanded that the German Democratic Republic be merged in the past. This attitude makes it impossible to restore Germany's unity in accordance with the principles of peace and democracy.

The Social Democratic Party opposes the Christian Democratic Union government's foreign policy of blindly following the United States. It calls for West Germany to withdraw from the North Atlantic military bloc and participate in a European collective security system jointly guaranteed by the Soviet Union and the United States, in order to promote German reunification. It also calls for the establishment of normal diplomatic and trade relations with socialist countries. On the other hand, the Social Democratic Party takes the same attitude as the Christian Democratic Union, refusing to recognize the existence of the German Democratic Republic and refusing to negotiate with the German Democratic Republic on the issue of reunification. It also stated that West Germany's withdrawal from the North Atlantic Group and the cancellation of military obligations would only be possible when German reunification is certain. However, there are also different opinions within the Social Democratic Party. Recently, a draft election program published by a group of parliamentarians and members of the Social Democratic Party put forward different proposals from the leading organs of the Social Democratic Party, demanding that the two Germanys conduct negotiations to study the steps to restore reunification.

The Free Democratic Party also has differences with the Christian Democratic Union. The Free Democratic Party opposes the Adenauer government's policy of dependence on the United States and advocates an independent foreign policy. It opposes the Adenauer government's practice of dividing Germany and supports the establishment of a European collective security system to unify Germany. The Free Democratic Party advocates the establishment of normal diplomatic and trade relations with socialist countries. But the Free Democratic Party also opposes contact with the German Democratic Republic. At the same time, it advocates that West Germany continue to remain in the North Atlantic Group.

The Social Democratic Party's and the Free Democratic Party's attitudes on foreign policy and the issue of German reunification, which differ from those of the Christian Democratic Union, reflect to a certain extent the wishes of the vast number of West German people and some bourgeois figures. Therefore, their influence among West German voters is growing. This obviously makes Adenauer feel uneasy. Therefore, since the beginning of this year, Adenauer has also tried his best to portray himself as a person enthusiastic about world peace and German reunification, in order to win votes. He put forward the proposition of banning thermonuclear weapons, suggested the establishment of an East-West "military sparse zone," and formed a committee with Western countries to discuss the issue of "German reunification," etc. However, in his recent reply to Bulganin, Adenauer still insisted on using the so-called "free elections" to annex the German Democratic Republic to solve the German problem. At the same time, he stepped up the establishment of the West German army.

	Economic Policy Issues

On the issue of economic policy and prices and wages, the Christian Democratic Union is closer to the Free Democratic Party. They are both supporters of the "social market economy" theory. They safeguard the interests of employers and advocate restricting strikes and freezing wages.

West Germany's foreign economic expansion and the recovery and development of the West German economy are a trump card for the Christian Democratic Union in the election. It vigorously publicizes the "prosperity" of the West German economy and attracts West German voters by increasing pensions and subsidizing farmers. The European Common Market Treaty recently signed by the six countries provides a very favorable prospect for West Germany to further expand its power. This can also win the support of many capitalists.

However, the policies of inflation and wage suppression have made the Adenauer government increasingly unpopular. Last year, the increase in coal and steel prices in West Germany caused prices to soar. In the past few months, the prices of 60% of daily necessities have been raised. Some prices have risen by more than 7% to 16%. The prices of major grains have increased by more than 50% since 1950, while wages have increased very slowly. Adenauer's policy is to minimize wage levels so that monopoly capitalist groups can obtain as much profit as possible.

In its propaganda, the Social Democratic Party advocates that the state should impose certain restraints on the "market economy" and adopt more so-called "social measures." Ollenhauer recently mentioned the idea of "nationalization of the coal and steel industry."

At present, the Social Democratic Party is using the issue of continuous price increases in West Germany to attack the West German government. The Social Democratic Party analyzes that the reasons for the price increases are rearmament and excessive economic expansion. It advocates increasing wages to make them commensurate with prices. However, Adenauer's Minister of Economic Affairs, Erhard, rejected this request.

	Rearmament Issues

On the issue of rearmament, the struggle is currently focused on the issues of military service and the equipment of West German troops with atomic weapons.

On the issue of military service, due to the strong opposition of the West German people, the Adenauer Group had to make some concessions. The 18-month military service period originally insisted on by the Bonn government had to be changed to 12 months. Last year, the Bonn government announced that it would conscript 40,000 young people born in 1937 into the army in April this year. In February, the Bonn Ministry of Defense announced that it would only conscript 10,000 young people for military service in April. These are all pre-election tactics, the purpose of which is to reduce opposition and defraud votes.

Despite these measures, West German workers, especially young workers, are still fighting against military service. Their struggle is influencing the attitudes of the leaders of the Social Democratic Party. The leaders of the Social Democratic Party have written checks: they will abolish military service after they come to power.

Recently, encouraged by the US and British announcement of the atomic arms race, Adenauer and Strauss openly demanded that the West German army should also have atomic weapons. However, Adenauer's plan to threaten Germany's security was immediately met with strong opposition from the West German people. On April 12, eighteen of West Germany's most famous atomic scientists jointly issued a statement opposing the equipment of the West German army with atomic weapons. The statement of West German scientists caused a sensation in West Germany. The Social Democratic Party, the Free Democratic Party, the Refugee Party, the Federation of Trade Unions with six million members, and many newspapers all supported the scientists' statement, forming a huge wave of opposition to Adenauer's atomic policy.

This situation is very unfavorable to Adenauer's party, so Adenauer specially invited some of the scientists who signed the statement for several hours of talks. In the final communique, Adenauer hypocritically expressed his agreement with the scientists' wishes, but did not mean to abandon the atomic arms policy in any way. This issue will become one of the central issues in the September election.

In order to strengthen his increasingly unstable position, Adenauer, in addition to adopting various deceptive measures, also used some old methods that Hitler had used. After illegally banning the German Communist Party last year, he recently banned the Saar Communist Party, closed down progressive groups such as the West German Democratic Women's Federation, and began to arrest progressive people. The West German government is attempting to use this fascist means to intimidate forces in West Germany that oppose Adenauer's policies. But in this regard, Adenauer may have overestimated his strength.

	Busy Overseas Activities

A little attention to observing the political situation in West Germany makes it easy to find that the overseas activities of West German political figures have clearly increased recently.

In early March, West German Foreign Minister Brentano went to the United States to hold talks with Dulles, and in May, Adenauer will personally go to the United States for a "fifth visit" in order to reach "coordination" with Washington's policies on the German issue.

In addition to the United States, West German government officials, including Adenauer himself, have also gone to many regions such as Iran, Turkey, India, Pakistan, Australia, and North Africa to make arrangements for West Germany's further economic expansion, in order to satisfy the growing demands of Ruhr industrialists.

Social Democratic Party Chairman Ollenhauer also visited the United States and Canada in February.

Obviously, these overseas activities of West German political figures are related to their election campaigns.

	The Free Democratic Party's Straddling Strategy

From the current situation, the two rival forces in this year's election are mainly the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party, and their strengths are almost equal. The Free Democratic Party is in between the two. It opposes the Adenauer government's policy of blindly following the United States like the Social Democratic Party, and strengthened its cooperation with the Social Democratic Party in last year's state elections; on the other hand, it agreed to the government's military plan, continued to collude with the Adenauer government, and attacked the Social Democratic Party on economic issues. It carefully refrains from making promises to either side, so that once the Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party are evenly matched in the general election, it can play a pivotal role.

    西德竞选序幕
    何疆
    西德大选的日期已经确定在9月15日。三千万西德选民将在这一天改选西德联邦议院的四百多名议员。新选出的第三届联邦议院的多数派将组织新的西德内阁。
    西德大选的序幕已经揭开。各个政党纷纷举行集会或代表会议，策划竞选策略，提出竞选口号。德国共产党已经遭到禁止，竞选主要是在基督教民主联盟、自由民主党和社会民主党之间进行。
    目前西德国内争论最多的问题是：外交政策和德国统一问题；经济政策和物价工资问题；重新武装问题。西德三大政党在这些问题上都各有不同的意见，竞选将围绕上述三个中心问题展开。
      外交和德国统一问题
    在外交政策和德国统一问题上，阿登纳领导的基督教民主联盟的政府坚决追随美国，使西德参加了侵略性的北大西洋军事集团，承担了军事义务，加深了德国的分裂。西德政府顽固地反对协商，拒绝同民主德国建立任何联系，而要求把德意志民主共和国归并过去。这种态度使得按照和平民主的原则恢复德国的统一成为不可能。
    社会民主党反对基督教民主族盟政府的一味追随美国的外交政策。它要求西德退出北大西洋军事集团而参加一个由苏联和美国共同保证的欧洲集体安全体系，并以此来促进德国的统一。它也要求同社会主义国家建立正常的外交和贸易关系。另一方面社会民主党却又和基督教民主联盟采取同样态度，不承认德意志民主共和国的存在，不肯和民主德国就统一问题进行谈判。它还表示西德退出北大西洋集团和取消军事义务只有在德国统一有把握的时候才有可能。但是，在社会民主党内部，也有不同的意见。最近社会民主党一批议员和党员所发表的竞选纲领草案，就提出了同社会民主党领导机构的不同的主张，要求两个德国进行谈判，研究恢复统一的步骤。
    自由民主党和基督教民主联盟也有分歧。自由民主党反对阿登纳政府的依附美国的政策，主张执行独立外交。它反对阿登纳政府分裂德国的做法，赞成建立欧洲集体安全体系来统一德国。自由民主党主张同社会主义国家建立正常的外交和贸易关系。但是自由民主党也反对同民主德国进行接触。同时它主张西德继续留在北大西洋集团。
    社会民主党和自由民主党在外交政策和德国统一问题上不同于基督教民主联盟的态度，在一定程度上反映了西德广大人民和一部分资产阶级人士的愿望。因此，它们在西德选民中的影响正越来越大。这显然使阿登纳感到不安。于是从今年年初起，阿登纳也竭力想把自己扮成一个热心于世界和平和德国统一的人，以此争取选票。他提出禁止热核子武器的主张，建议成立东西方“军事疏稀区”，和西方国家组成一个委员会来讨论“德国统一”问题等等。但是不久前阿登纳在给布尔加宁的复信中依然坚持要用并吞民主德国的所谓“自由选举”的办法来解决德国问题。同时他又加紧建立西德军队。
            经济政策问题
    在经济政策和物价工资问题上，基督教民主联盟则和自由民主党比较接近。它们都是“社会市场经济”论的拥护者。它们维护雇主的利益、主张限制罢工和冻结工资。
    西德对外经济扩张和西德经济的恢复和发展是基督教民主联盟在竞选中的一张王牌。它大力宣传西德经济的“繁荣”，并且以增加养老金和补助农民等办法来吸引西德选民。而最近六国签订的欧洲共同市场条约，为西德进一步扩张势力提供了一个非常有利的前景。这也可以博得不少资本家的支持。
    但是通货膨胀和压低工资的政策却使得阿登纳政府愈来愈不得民心。去年西德煤、钢价格的提高引起了物价飞涨。过去几个月里，60％的日用品抬高了售价。某些物价腾贵了7％到16％多。主要的粮食价格从1950年以来上涨了50％以上，而工资却增加得很慢。阿登纳的政策是尽量压低工资水平，以便垄断资本集团取得尽可能多的利润。
    社会民主党在宣传上主张由国家对“市场经济”加以某些约束，多采取所谓“社会措施”。奥伦豪尔最近还提到“煤钢工业国有化”的主张。
    目前社会民主党利用西德物价接连上涨的问题向西德政府进行攻击。社会民主党分析涨价的原因是重新武装和过度的经济扩张。它主张提高工资，使它同物价相适应。但是阿登纳的经济部长艾哈德拒绝了这个要求。
            重新武装问题
    在重新武装的问题上目前斗争主要集中在兵役问题和西德军队装备原子武器的问题上。
    在兵役问题上，由于西德人民强烈的反对，阿登纳集团不得不作了若干让步。波恩政府起先所坚持的十八个月兵役期，现在不得不改为十二个月。去年波恩政府宣布要在今年4月征召四万名1937年出生的青年入伍。2月间波恩国防部则宣布在4月只征召一万名青年服兵役。这些都是在选举前的手腕，其目的是减少反对，骗取选票。
    尽管有这些手段，西德工人，尤其是青年工人依然在为反对兵役而斗争。他们的斗争影响着社会民主党领导人物的态度。社会民主党领导人已开出支票：他们上台后要废除兵役。
    最近，在英美宣布原子军备竞赛的鼓励之下，阿登纳和施特劳斯公然要求西德军队也应当拥有原子武器。但是阿登纳这种威胁德国安全的打算立即遭到了西德人民的有力反对。4月12日西德十八位最著名的原子科学家联合发表声明，反对以原子武器装备西德军队。西德科学家的声明在西德引起了轰动。社会民主党、自由民主党、难民党和拥有六百万会员的工会联合会以及许多报纸都支持科学家的声明，形成了一个巨大的反对阿登纳原子政策的浪潮。
    这种形势对于阿登纳的党非常不利，所以阿登纳特地邀请了一部分在声明上签名的科学家，会谈了好几个钟头。在最后发表的公报中，阿登纳假惺惺地表示赞同科学家们的愿望，却没有任何放弃原子军备政策的意思。这个问题势将成为9月大选中的中心问题之一。
    阿登纳为了加强自己日益不稳的地位，除了采取各种欺骗性的措施，也使用了希特勒曾经用过的一些老办法。在去年非法禁止德国共产党后，最近又取缔了萨尔共产党，封闭了西德的民主妇联等进步团体，并且开始逮捕进步人士。西德政府企图用这种法西斯手段来恐吓西德国内反对阿登纳政策的力量。但是在这方面，阿登纳可能过高地估计了自己的力量。
            繁忙的海外活动
    稍稍注意观察西德的政情，就不难发现西德政界人物的海外活动近来显然增多了。
    3月初西德政府的外交部长勃伦塔诺去美国和杜勒斯举行了会谈，5月里阿登纳又将亲自到美国去作“第五次访问”，以便在德国问题上同华盛顿的政策取得“协调”。
    除了美国之外，西德政府要人、包括阿登纳自己还纷纷出动到伊朗、土耳其、印度、巴基斯坦、澳大利亚和北非等许多地区进行活动，为西德的进一步经济扩张作安排，以便满足鲁尔工业家们越来越多的要求。
    社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔在2月间也先后访问了美国和加拿大。
    显然，西德政治人物的这些海外活动，是和他们的竞选有关系的。
        自由民主党的骑墙策略
    从目前情况来看，在今年大选中两个匹敌的力量主要是基督教民主联盟和社会民主党，它们彼此力量相差无几。自由民主党处于两者之间。它既和社会民主党一样反对阿登纳政府的一味追随美国的政策，并且在去年州选举中加强了和社会民主党的合作；而另一方面又同意政府的军事计划，并且继续和阿登纳政府有所勾结，还在经济问题上攻击社会民主党。它小心翼翼地两头都不许下诺言，以便一旦基督教民主联盟和社会民主党在大选中处于势均力敌的时候，可以举足轻重。
