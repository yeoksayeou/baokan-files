    Watching Landscape Films
    Huang Miaozi
    I believe the significance of color landscape films should be interpreted as photographers using cameras to paint, rather than using cameras to rigidly absorb superficial impressions in place of human eyes. If it's the latter, then the camera can never be competent and will fail.
    The beauty of scenery itself is never isolated; it must be linked to everything around it—moving, static, present, and past things, especially human activities—to produce a high degree of aesthetic feeling. The makers of landscape films must have precise and bold selection, discarding, and processing of nature, so that the scenery brought to the screen is more real than real. This is what I call "painting with a camera." I felt this even more strongly when I saw the old work "Rain" by film master Joris Ivens more than a month ago.
    It would be unrealistic to say that such a simple principle is still unfamiliar to landscape filmmakers. However, after watching some landscape films, I do feel that the "painting" component is insufficient, and therefore the effect of landscape films arousing aesthetic feeling is somewhat lacking. Some landscape films can almost be summarized by the following formula: mountains plus water, plus a girl in new clothes (or a labor model on vacation). The slow pace, the camera follows the movement, and it is filmed into a landscape film.
    Take the color landscape film "Mount Lu" as an example. It is naturally a landscape film, but we can only say that it is an "ordinary" landscape film. It does not infect the audience with the "beauty" of Mount Lu. The characteristics of Mount Lu, such as the ever-changing clouds, the famous ancient temples, the clean and beautiful streets of Guling, and the happy life of summer vacationers on the mountain (unique stone houses, swimming pools, shops selling specialties...), are not seen in the film. After watching the entire film, one still has the feeling of Su Dongpo's "unable to recognize the true face of Mount Lu." Mount Lu is a beautiful and moving place. The filming of this film should make it attractive and arouse people's desire to go and see it in person. The film should not be a "dry" recording of one mountain after another, one stream of water after another (the film's narration also quotes Li Bai's poems about Mount Lu, but unfortunately, the picture is not combined with the emotion of the poem, and the desired effect is not achieved).
    We feel that the filming of "Guilin Scenery" is more successful because the peaks of Guilin are varied and easy to express characteristics. If Mount Lu or any mountain is handled in the same way as "Guilin Scenery," it will feel monotonous after watching too much. Someone once said: "The first person to compare a beauty to a flower is a genius, the second person to compare a beauty to a flower is an idiot." I often smile painfully when I think of this sentence.
    Compared with "Mount Lu," "Suzhou Gardens" is a more satisfying film. Unfortunately, the loud instruments are noisy from beginning to end, making it impossible for you to calm down and watch. In fact, this is also a very simple principle: film is a comprehensive art, a good combination is "complementary," a bad combination is a fight. When people are wholeheartedly using their eyes to appreciate the structure and color of the picture, a little quiet sound is really needed! I once suggested using the guqin to bring the audience into Chinese landscape films. Of course, this does not mean that every film is suitable. Sometimes, in certain scenes, even no sound at all can evoke the most beautiful feelings in the audience. Didn't Bai Juyi write the line "At this time, silence is better than sound"?
    In the picture of "Suzhou Gardens," there are three ducks swimming in the water of both the Lingering Garden and the Humble Administrator's Garden. A painter once asked me when watching it: "What's the point of putting the ducks in the Lingering Garden to shoot a few shots, then taking them out and putting them in the Humble Administrator's Garden to shoot a few shots?" The words may lack subtlety, but it is a fact that repeated shots will make the audience bored. Although "Suzhou Gardens" also has individual similar techniques as mentioned above, since gardens are gardens after all, with more changes, the audience does not feel overly dull.

    看风景片

    我以为彩色风景片的意义应该解释为摄影家使用摄影机作画，而不是用摄影机代替人的眼睛呆板地吸取表面印象；如果是后者，那么摄影机无论如何是不能胜任而会遭到失败的。
    风景本身的美绝不会是孤立的，它必须和周围一切动的、静的、现在的和过去的事物，特别是人的活动联系起来才能产生高度的美感。风景片的摄制者必须对自然有精确而大胆的选择、取舍和加工，使搬到银幕上的风景比真的还要真实，这就是我所谓“用摄影机作画”。一个多月以前看了电影大师伊文思的旧作“雨”的时候，我更有这样的感觉。
    说这样简单的道理对于风景片摄制家们还是陌生的话，那未免不合事实。可是当我看了一些风景片之后，确实感到“画”的成份不够，因此风景片应该叫人发生美感这一效果就差一些。有些风景片几乎是可以用以下的公式来概括它：山加水，再加穿新衣的少女（或休养中的劳动模范）。那慢吞吞的脚步，镜头就跟着移动，就拍成一本风景片。
    拿彩色风景片“庐山”来说，它自然是一部风景片，可是我们只能说它是一部“普通”的风景片，它没有把庐山的“美”感染给观众。庐山的特点如千变万化的云，有名的古代寺庙，整洁美丽的牯岭街头和避暑人在山上的快乐生活（特有的石砌房子、游泳池、卖特产的铺子……）等在片子里面看不到，看完了全部片子，依然有苏东坡所说的“不识庐山真面目”之感。庐山，这是一个美丽动人的地方。拍摄这部片子应该使它能吸引人，引起人们非亲自去看一下不可的欲望。片子不应该是“干巴巴”的记录下一个个山头，一片片流水（片子的旁白也引用李白咏庐山的诗句，可惜画面没有和诗句的感情结合，得不到应有的效果）。
    我们觉得“桂林山水”的摄制比较成功，因为桂林的山峰变化多，容易表现特点。如果庐山或者什么山都像“桂林山水”一样手法，看多了就有千篇一律之感。有人说过这样的话：“第一次拿花来比美人的是天才，第二次拿花来比美人的是白痴。”我常常想到这句话就会痛苦地一笑。
    “苏州园林”和“庐山”比起来是较使人满意的片子。可惜的是响亮的乐器从头至尾吵得你不能静下心来看。其实这也是极简单的道理：电影是综合艺术，综合得好是“相得益彰”，综合不好就打起架来。当人们全心全意用眼睛在欣赏画面的结构和色彩的时候，安静一点的音响真是万分需要！我曾经建议用古琴来把观众带进中国的风景片中，当然这不是说每一部片子都适宜，有时在某些场面上甚至一点声音都没有反而能够引起观众最美的感受。白居易不是写过“此时无声胜有声”的诗句吗？
    “苏州园林”的画面中，留园和拙政园的水上都有三只鸭子游泳，一位画家看时曾向我发问：“把鸭子放到留园拍几个镜头，捞起来再放到拙政园拍几个镜头，这有什么意思呢？”话也许说得缺乏含蓄，可是重复的镜头会使观众乏味却是事实。“苏州园林”虽然也有个别类似上述的手法，但因园林到底是园林，变化多一些，观众就不感到过分沉闷。
