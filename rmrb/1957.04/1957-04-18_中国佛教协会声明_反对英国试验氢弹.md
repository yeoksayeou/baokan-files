Xinhua News Agency, April 15th: The Buddhist Association of China today issued a statement, representing all Chinese Buddhists in opposing the British hydrogen bomb testing on Christmas Island.

The statement said: "Based on the teachings of Buddha and the conscience of humanity, we have decided to fully support the righteous appeals and protests made by Japanese Buddhists, the Japanese people, and peace-loving people of all countries against nuclear weapons testing, especially against the British hydrogen bomb testing on Christmas Island."

"In order to strive for lasting world peace," the statement said, "we must replace weapons with compassion and intimidation with sincerity."

The statement emphasized that refusing to stop hydrogen bomb testing is equivalent to refusing to stop mass murder, and "sowing such evil causes will not yield any good results." The statement pointed out that the harm to human health caused by the explosion test itself, especially the threat to the lives of children, is also not permitted by humanitarianism.

    中国佛教协会声明
    反对英国试验氢弹
    新华社15日讯  中国佛教协会今天发表声明，代表全中国佛教徒反对英国在圣诞岛试验氢弹。
    声明说：我们本着佛陀的教训和人类的良心，决定以全力支持日本佛教徒、日本人民和各国爱好和平人士为反对核子武器试验，特别是为反对英国在圣诞岛的氢弹试验所提出的正义的呼吁和抗议。
    “为了争取世界持久和平，”声明说：“我们必须以慈悲代替武器，以诚意代替威吓。”
    声明强调说：拒绝停止氢弹试验，等于拒绝停止大规模杀人，“种这样的恶因，是得不到任何善果的”。声明指出：爆炸试验本身对人体健康的危害，特别是对儿童生命的威胁，也是人道主义所不允许的事。
