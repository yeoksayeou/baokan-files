Random Thoughts on the Youth Art Exhibition

    Sparrow Beating
    Since the launch of the campaign to eliminate the four pests, many "heroic" images of sparrow beating have appeared in paintings, and I always feel something is not quite right. The question is not whether sparrows should be beaten, but rather I don't quite agree with painting innocent children with fierce expressions, pretending to be heroes. We were all children once, and we also beat sparrows. At that time, our mood was probably for fun, or to gain something through our labor. If we insist on saying that we had murderous intent and attacked the little sparrows, I'm afraid that would be unjust. Today's children beat sparrows so vigorously, even though there is a social force encouraging them, their mood is at most like hunters, "the more they beat, the more they gain," how could they be so fierce as if they were meeting enemies? Therefore, these kinds of images are not real.
    In traditional Chinese painting, sparrows are appreciated as lively and clever little animals. Painters have an emotion for them, feeling that they are cute and fun, and thus have generated some imagination to embellish them. Since then, they have become a subject that flower-and-bird painters are happy to depict. Xu Xi painted them, Ren Bonian painted them, Qi Baishi also painted them, and Xu Beihong once painted a "Morning Song," appreciating the chirping of sparrows on branches as a pleasant chorus; but now sparrows are treated as objects of curses and satire. This idea really makes it difficult to change painters' interest in sparrows, for example, the painting "Sparrows Fat, Grain Ears Thin" should have been an autumn scene of "Grain Fragrant, Sparrows Come," but now it is forcibly attached with a "ideological" inscription. Even so, readers still understand that the painter's emotion is there, not here.
    The Painter's Eyes
    Painting is the art of modeling. Its content is not conveyed through titles or other things, but should be conveyed through the modeling itself. Some works that belong to the expression of plots need to fully and accurately handle the relationship between the characters in order to clearly explain the plot to the audience. Some painters don't pay much attention to the characteristics of modeling art, and often force a story that is not suitable for visual representation as the subject of painting. The effect of doing this is thankless, so some works are difficult to guess, or simply incomprehensible.
    Another kind of work has very clear content and meaning, and the explanatory power of the image is as accurate as a science and hygiene chart, but its function ends there. Besides telling you what this is or what that is, or that you should do this or you should do that, you can't get anything else from the image. For example, the title of the work is a famous mountain or river in a certain place, and the painting is indeed a famous mountain or river in a certain place, but this painting has nothing touching.
    Some paintings are incomprehensible, not durable to watch, or you can't see any meaning; but some paintings can really make people linger. Presumably, paintings with charm, in addition to the authenticity and persuasiveness of the image itself, must have a "painterly intent" that is meaningful and enough to make people contemplate. "Painterly intent" is an artistic conception created by the painter that satisfies visual pleasure, and this artistic conception is equivalent to the poetic conception created by the poet. Therefore, painters must use the eyes of painters to observe life and express life, not the eyes of surveyors, let alone the eyes of ordinary people.

    看青年美展杂感

    打麻雀
    除四害运动开展以后，绘画中出现了许多打麻雀的“英雄”形象，心里总感到有些不对劲。问题并非麻雀该不该打，而是不大同意把天真的孩子们画成一副凶相，硬装英雄模样。我们都曾经是小孩子，也打过麻雀，当时的心情大概是为了好玩，或者想通过自己的劳动获得什么，如果硬说是动了杀机向小麻雀进攻，恐怕是冤枉的。今天的孩子打麻雀打得那么起劲，尽管有一种社会力量在鼓励他们，他们的心情至多也不过像猎人那样“多打多得”，何至于像仇人相见那样凶狠呢。因此，这类形象是不真实的。
    麻雀在国画里是当作一种活泼机灵的小动物来欣赏。画家对它们寄予了一种感情，觉得它们可爱好玩，因此就产生了某种想像，把它们来渲染一番。从此成为花鸟画家乐于描写的一种题材，徐熙画过，任伯年画过，齐白石也画过，徐悲鸿曾经画过一幅“晨曲”，把麻雀在枝头的叫噪，当做悦耳的合唱来欣赏；但是现在却把麻雀当做被诅咒和被讽刺的对象。这种想法也真难改变画家们对麻雀的兴趣，譬如以“雀肥谷穗瘦”这幅画为例，应该是一幅“谷香麻雀来”的秋景图，现在硬装上那么一句带有“思想性”的题字，虽如此，读者仍然懂得画家的感情在彼而不在此。
    画家的眼睛
    绘画是造型的艺术。它的内容不是通过标题说明或其他的东西，而是应该通过造型本身来传达。有些属于表现情节的作品，需要充分准确地处理人物之间的关系，才能把情节明确地交代给观众。有些画家不大考虑造型艺术的特点，往往把一个不适宜于用视觉形象来表现的故事情节，勉强作为绘画的题材，这样作的效果是吃力不讨好，所以有些作品费人猜测，或者干脆看不懂。
    另有一种作品，内容含义非常明确，形象的说明力准确得像科学卫生挂图，然而它的作用也就到此为止。除了告诉你这是什么那是什么或你应这样你应那样之外，不能从形象中再获得什么。譬如，作品标题是某地的名山大川，画的也确实是某地的名山大川，但是这幅画并无感人之处。
    有些画看不懂，不耐看，或看不出什么意思；可是有些画也真能使人徘徊不去。大概具有魅力的画，除了形象本身的真实性和说服力外，必然具备一种意味隽永足以令人沉思的“画意”。“画意”是画家所创造的满足视觉快感的艺术意境，这种意境相当于诗人所创造的诗的意境。所以画家要用画家的眼睛来观察生活和表现生活，既不是测绘员的眼睛，更不是普通人的眼睛。
