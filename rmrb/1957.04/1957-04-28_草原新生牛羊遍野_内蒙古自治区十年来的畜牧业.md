New Life on the Grasslands, Livestock Covering the Fields
Animal Husbandry in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Over the Past Decade
Du Gu'erzabu, Director of the Animal Husbandry Bureau of the People's Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region

Total Number of Livestock in the Region Doubles in Ten Years

Animal husbandry occupies a very important position in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. More than half of the region's 1.4 million square kilometers of land is pastoral area. 350,000 Mongolian herdsmen and some Daur, Solon, and Tungus herdsmen are engaged in animal husbandry production in pastoral areas. Animal husbandry also has a large proportion in agricultural areas and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas. The animal husbandry of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has greatly developed in the ten years from the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in 1947 to the present. In 1947, there were 8.28 million head of large and small livestock in the entire autonomous region. By 1956, it had developed to 24.35 million head, an increase of more than two times. Including pigs, the total number of livestock in the autonomous region in 1956 reached 26 million.

Animal husbandry production technology has been improved. There are already 1,330 sets of mowing and raking machines in the region. 5 billion catties of grass were mowed in 1956. The area of artificially planted feed crops in agricultural and pastoral areas reached 1.1 million mu. 210,000 sheds and pens have been built. The number of wells and waterwheels has also increased. Bovine plague, an animal disease, has been eliminated. Anthrax, emphysema, and foot-and-mouth disease can be effectively controlled. The ability to defend against various disasters has been improved compared to the past.

The socialist transformation of animal husbandry in pastoral areas has achieved great success. By the end of 1956, 551 pastoral production cooperatives had been established in the region. The number of herding households participating in pastoral cooperatives accounted for more than 23% of the total number of herding households. Together with the herding households participating in mutual aid groups, the organized herding households already accounted for 83% of the total number of herding households. The socialist transformation of the pastoral owner (Bayan) economy has also begun on a trial basis. Thirteen joint public-private livestock farms have been established in the region, absorbing nineteen pastoral owners to participate in the cooperatives.

The number of state-owned livestock farms has developed to 39, of which 5 livestock farms have mechanical equipment with 117 standard tractors. 250 livestock and veterinary stations have been established. A grassland work station with mechanical equipment has been built. In order to improve the quality of livestock, 252 sheep breeding stations, 4 cattle breeding stations, and 47 horse breeding stations have been established.

In order to carry out animal husbandry and veterinary scientific research and train cadres, an animal husbandry and veterinary science research institute, an animal husbandry and veterinary college, and three primary and secondary animal husbandry and veterinary schools have been established.

As a result of the development of animal husbandry, the lives of the broad masses of herdsmen have been greatly improved. The average number of livestock owned by each herdsman in the pastoral area has increased from 13.8 in 1946 to 37.2 in 1956. This has enabled the broad masses of herdsmen to get rid of the historical state of poverty. As a result of the development of animal husbandry production, great support has been given to agricultural production. A considerable number of the 520,000 cattle and horses exported from the autonomous region are used as agricultural draft animals. As a result of the development of animal husbandry, it has also made great contributions to the supply of urban meat and industrial raw materials. According to the materials from 1950 to 1956, the state-owned commercial export from the region alone amounted to 2.1 million head of cattle, horses, sheep, and pigs, 38,000 tons of frozen meat, 7.13 million hides and skins of various types, and 45,000 tons of wool, cashmere, and camel hair.

Implement Various Policies and Oppose Wrong Tendencies

The development process of animal husbandry in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is a process of formulating policies based on the central government's guidelines and policies and the actual conditions in Inner Mongolia, implementing various policies, and opposing incorrect tendencies.

The policy of "free grazing" was a fundamental policy of the Party and the People's Government of the Autonomous Region in the pastoral areas in the early days of liberation. This was formulated after consultation with representatives from all walks of life in response to the fact that the grasslands and pastures in the pastoral areas were monopolized by a few people, and that there was still a partial slave system in the pastoral areas. "Free grazing" meant, with reference to the past habits of the Mongolian people, that the grasslands and pastures within Inner Mongolia were declared to be owned by the Mongolian people, and that herdsmen had the freedom to graze within their respective administrative divisions. The implementation of the "free grazing" policy abolished the slave system, liberated the productive forces bound by the feudal system, and opened up broad roads for the development of animal husbandry production.

The policy of no struggle, no division, no class division, and benefiting both herdsmen and pastoral owners was another important policy of the Party in the pastoral areas in the early days of liberation. At that time, land reform was being carried out in agricultural areas, and some cadres moved the method of equally dividing land in agricultural areas to pastoral areas, putting forward the erroneous slogan of "tillers own their land, herdsmen own their livestock," and actually divided livestock in some pastoral areas, resulting in the loss and death of livestock. The main reason for this problem was that some people did not understand that the pastoral economy and the agricultural economy had their own different characteristics. At the same time, the pastoral owners were not the same as the landlords. After abolishing feudal privileges and implementing "free grazing" in the pastoral areas, the exploitation of the pastoral owners was basically capitalist in nature. Therefore, preserving the pastoral owner economy, implementing the policy of benefiting both herdsmen and pastoral owners, and encouraging their enthusiasm for developing production was not harmful but beneficial to the development of the pastoral area economy. The result of implementing this policy was to mobilize people from all walks of life in the pastoral areas to develop production, and the number of livestock increased rapidly. Practice has proved that this policy is correct.

In the development of animal husbandry, the erroneous ideological tendencies of "emphasizing agriculture and neglecting animal husbandry" and "backwardness of animal husbandry" have been criticized and opposed in agricultural areas, semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, and pastoral areas. Comrades who hold this erroneous idea neglect animal husbandry production and do not attach importance to the importance of combining agriculture and animal husbandry. They mechanically believe that the transformation of nomadic economy into agricultural economy is a kind of progress from the historical point of view, so they believe that today's animal husbandry production has no future without changing to agriculture. These comrades do not understand that due to the more detailed social and economic division of labor and the urgent need of the country and the people for a large number of livestock and animal products, the future of animal husbandry production, whether at present or in the future, is very bright and promising. Therefore, it is necessary to realize the combination of agriculture and animal husbandry in agricultural areas, and in pastoral areas, it is necessary to pay attention to the gradual development of agriculture while vigorously developing animal husbandry to support the further development of animal husbandry.

Pastoral Production Cooperatives Have Great Superiority

With the continuous development of the autonomous region's politics, economy, and culture, and the tremendous influence of the socialist transformation movement, the pastoral areas have already put forward the issue of developing animal husbandry production with mutual assistance and cooperation as the center. Therefore, on the basis of the existing production mutual assistance among herdsmen, the animal husbandry cooperativization movement has been gradually carried out. At present, the cooperative has a certain scale, and the pastoral production cooperative has initially shown great superiority. These superiorities are:

First, it has increased production and increased the income of the members. The breeding rate, survival rate, and net proliferation rate of livestock in many cooperatives are higher than those of mutual aid groups and individual herdsmen, and the number of livestock increases year by year. According to the materials of 346 cooperatives, 93% of the cooperatives increased production, and 80%-90% of the members increased their income. Some cooperatives have even achieved increased income for all members.

Second, it has improved operation and management and solved the difficulty of insufficient labor force. The cooperative has implemented planned herd combination and separation grazing for livestock herds, and has used pastures rationally in a planned way, and improved feeding management. Many cooperatives have implemented labor planning, rationally allocated the labor force, and played the role of the labor force.

Third, it is conducive to the basic construction of the cooperative. For example, building water conservancy projects, opening up new pastures, cultivating and improving pastures, building sheds and pens, and purchasing new animal husbandry production tools, etc., the cooperative has done many things that individual herdsmen find difficult to do.

Fourth, it has created good conditions for diversified operations. Many pastoral cooperatives have developed agriculture and established feed bases under the conditions of focusing on animal husbandry. Many pastoral cooperatives have not only solved the feed problem, but some cooperatives have also achieved self-sufficiency in grain and no longer rely on imports from agricultural areas. Subsidiary production has also developed under unified planning.

Fifth, it has promoted settled nomadism, creating conditions for the prosperity of both people and livestock in pastoral areas. Many cooperatives have built settlements after the establishment of the cooperative. Some have planted vegetables and trees, and some have built houses to improve living conditions. Some cooperatives have also carried out some cultural and health work.

Sixth, it has improved production technology and carried out breed improvement and veterinary epidemic prevention work. Many cooperatives have improved their production technology with the help of their own experience and the animal husbandry and veterinary station. Breed improvement has also achieved considerable success.

Because of these superiorities, the pastoral production cooperative has been supported by the people in the pastoral areas, proving that it is an appropriate form for individual herdsmen to transition to socialism.

In order to enable cooperativization to develop healthily, we have repeatedly emphasized that we must act in accordance with the ethnic characteristics of the pastoral areas, the characteristics of the animal husbandry economy, and the level of awareness of the herdsmen:

First, in terms of guidelines, policies, and steps, it is emphasized that transformation should be carried out on the basis of stable development of production, and should be handled in accordance with the spirit of "stability, leniency, and length." That is, the policy should be stable, the method should be lenient, and the steps should be allowed to be different from place to place and the time should be allowed to complete the socialist transformation in a longer time. In the implementation of the policy, the primary principle is to absolutely abide by the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit. Whether to join the cooperative or not is voluntary, and it is free to withdraw from the cooperative after joining the cooperative, and it is welcome to rejoin the cooperative after withdrawing from the cooperative; the method of running the cooperative is also decided according to the wishes of the members; in taking care of the interests of both labor and livestock, not only the interests of the majority of people are taken care of, but also the interests of the minority of people. The scale of the cooperative should generally not be large.

Second, in the method of joining the cooperative, it is emphasized to adopt methods that the masses can understand and easily accept, and the masses are allowed to leave enough self-retained livestock that they think they need voluntarily, and there is no limit to the amount of self-retained livestock. At present, the method of "basic female livestock joining the cooperative according to the number of heads, and profit sharing according to the proportion of labor and livestock" is widely used in the pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia. This is a method that the masses are more accustomed to. It can closely combine personal interests and collective interests, so it can be widely promoted. The method of "livestock entering the cooperative according to grade scoring and profit sharing in proportion" is also a more commonly used method and can also be promoted according to local conditions. Some cooperatives also adopt the method of entering the cooperative at a price and paying fixed interest and other methods.

Third, doing a good job in production and ensuring that the number of livestock in the cooperative increases year by year and the quality is gradually improved is an important sign of running a good cooperative. The key to increasing production is to implement the policy of running the cooperative diligently and thriftily and democratically, and improving operation and management. The remuneration system adopts a simple and easy-to-implement contracting method and implements the principle of more work for more pay; in production, the policy of focusing on animal husbandry, combining agriculture and animal husbandry, and developing diversified operations is implemented.

Fourth, the income distribution policy of the cooperative must play an active role in encouraging herdsmen inside and outside the cooperative to develop production and correctly stipulate the proportion of labor and livestock dividends. It is necessary to make households with more livestock feel that livestock can be developed faster and increase more income after joining the cooperative; households with more labor force feel that the labor force can be fully utilized and get more actual benefits after joining the cooperative. On the issue of distribution, it is necessary to oppose the tendency of lowering livestock remuneration, cutting fat to make up for thin, and making households with more livestock suffer losses, and also to oppose the tendency of inappropriately increasing livestock remuneration and making households with less livestock and more labor force suffer losses.

Fifth, in combination with the development of cooperatives, settled nomadism is promoted. The state has given assistance to cooperatives in supporting settled nomadism.

Repeatedly Consult with Pastoral Owners to Start Transforming the Pastoral Owner Economy

Another important part of the socialist transformation of animal husbandry is the socialist transformation of the pastoral owner economy. Under the situation of gradual cooperativization in pastoral areas, the continued development of the pastoral owner economy has encountered difficulties, such as insufficient labor force and difficulty in hiring workers. If these problems are not solved, they will hinder the continued development of production. At the same time, under the influence of the nationwide upsurge of socialist transformation, pastoral owners also have the desire to take the socialist road. According to this actual situation, we followed the central government's policy of peaceful transformation of pastoral owners, and after repeated consultations with pastoral owners, we initially started typical pilot work.

Over the past year, we have the following experiences in the socialist transformation of the pastoral owner economy:

(A) Various forms can be adopted to transform the pastoral owner economy. Joint venture livestock farms can be established, cooperatives can be joined, Suluk (Suluk, Mongolian, meaning renting livestock) can be raised by cooperatives, state-owned livestock farms can be raised, and other methods that are conducive to transformation and easily accepted by pastoral owners can also be adopted. It is also possible for a pastoral owner to adopt several methods at the same time. Those who are temporarily unwilling to accept transformation are still allowed to continue to hire workers to operate, and the government still provides assistance if there are difficulties in hiring workers for production.

(B) Whether to run a joint venture livestock farm or join a cooperative, it must be based on needs and possibilities, and based on the voluntariness of the pastoral owner. If the pastoral owner is willing to transform, but the state does not have enough manpower, financial resources, and material resources to support it, it can be temporarily not done. If the pastoral owner is unwilling to accept the transformation, it can be temporarily not transformed.

(C) In the socialist transformation, it is still necessary to continue to implement the policy of no struggle, no division, no class division, and benefiting both herdsmen and pastoral owners, and the pastoral owner economy should still be protected.

In accordance with these spirits, we paid attention to solving the following problems in the pilot process: pastoral owners were given appropriate arrangements, and most of the pastoral owners who entered the farm took on the responsibilities of farm director, deputy farm director, or other appropriate positions; Suluk that had been released were generally not recovered during the joint venture, and the pastoral owners continued to share dividends; the valuation of livestock, dividend sharing, and fixed interest were all decided through consultation, and self-retained livestock were all voluntary; in production, the policy of doing things simply, operating diligently and thriftily, and seeking development in production was implemented.

In terms of pastoral owners participating in cooperatives: Pastoral owners are allowed to serve as members of the management committee and other positions to give play to their specialties in operating and managing production; in the issue of shareholding and dividend sharing, mutual benefit is earnestly achieved; Suluk that had been released in the past are still allowed to share dividends; self-retained livestock are all voluntary.

The pilot situation has initially proved that the pilot joint venture livestock farms and the individual absorption of pastoral owners into cooperatives are methods that pastoral owners can accept and are conducive to production. However, since the transformation of pastoral owners is still in the exploratory pilot stage, experience and methods are very lacking and need to be further summarized in practice and researched in order to carry out the transformation of the pastoral owner economy more steadily.

    草原新生牛羊遍野
    内蒙古自治区十年来的畜牧业
    内蒙古自治区人民委员会畜牧厅厅长　都固尔扎布
    全区牲畜总数  十年增加两倍
    畜牧业经济在内蒙古自治区占有很重要的地位，全区一百四十万平方公里的土地上，一半以上是牧区，在牧区从事畜牧业生产的有三十五万蒙古族牧民和一部分达呼尔、索伦、通古斯族牧民。农业区和半农半牧区，畜牧业也有很大的比重。内蒙古自治区的畜牧业，从1947年内蒙古自治区建立到现在的十年间有了很大的发展。1947年全自治区有大小牲畜八百二十八万头，到1956年已发展到二千四百三十五万头，增加了两倍以上；连同猪，全自治区1956年牲畜总头数达到二千六百万头。
    畜牧业生产技术已经有了提高。全区已有打搂草机一千三百三十套，1956年打草五十亿斤，人工种植的饲料作物，农牧区共达一百一十万亩。棚圈已建了二十一万座。水井、水车，都有增加。牲畜疫病中的牛瘟已经消灭，炭疽、气肿疽、口蹄疫已经可以有效的控制。对各种灾害的防御力量，已经比过去提高。
    牧区畜牧业的社会主义改造，已取得很大成就。到1956年终，全区已经办了五百五十一个牧业生产合作社，参加牧业合作社的牧户，占总牧户的23％以上，连同参加互助组的牧户，组织起来的牧户已经占总牧户的83％。对牧主（巴音）经济的社会主义改造，也已经开始试办。全区现已试办公私合营牧场十三个，吸收了十九户牧主参加合作社。
    国营牧场已经发展到三十九个，其中五个牧场有机械设备，有一百一十七标准台拖拉机，畜牧兽医工作站已建立二百五十处。有机械设备的草原工作站已经建成一处。为了提高牲畜质量，已经设立羊配种站二百五十二处，牛配种站四处，马配种站四十七处。
    为了进行畜牧兽医科学研究和培养干部，已经建立畜牧兽医科学研究所一所，畜牧兽医学院一所，初、中级畜牧兽医学校三所。
    畜牧业发展的结果，广大的牧民生活有很大改善，牧区每一个牧民平均占有的牲畜头数，已由1946年的十三点八头，上升到1956年的三十七点二头。这样就使广大牧民摆脱了历史上的贫困状态。畜牧业生产发展的结果，对农业生产有很大支援。自治区输出区外的五十二万头牛、马中有相当数量是作为农业耕畜的。畜牧业发展的结果，对供应城市肉食和工业原料方面，也有很大贡献。据1950年到1956年的材料，仅国营商业输出区外的牛、马、羊、猪达二百一十万头，冻肉三万八千吨，各种皮张七百一十三万张，羊毛、羊绒、驼毛四万五千吨。
    贯彻各项政策  反对错误倾向
    内蒙古自治区畜牧业发展的过程，是根据中央的方针政策和内蒙的实际情况制订政策，贯彻执行各项政策和反对不正确倾向的过程。
      “放牧自由”政策，是解放初期自治区党和人民政府在牧区的一项根本政策。这是针对当时牧区的草牧场为少数人所独占，和牧区还存在部分奴隶制度的情况下，经过与各方面代表人物的协商而制定的。“放牧自由”就是参照蒙古民族过去的习惯，宣布在内蒙古境内草牧场为蒙古民族所公有，牧民在各该行政区划内都有放牧的自由。实行“放牧自由”政策，废除了奴隶制度，解放了为封建制度所束缚的生产力，为畜牧业生产的发展开辟了广阔的道路。
    不斗不分不划阶级和牧工、牧主两利政策，是解放初期党在牧区的又一重要政策。当时农业区正在进行土地改革，有一部分干部把农业区平分土地的办法搬到牧业区，提出所谓“耕者有其田、牧者有其畜”的错误口号，并且实际上在一部分牧业区分了牲畜，结果造成了牲畜的损失和死亡。发生这一问题的主要原因是有一部分人不了解牧业经济与农业经济有其不同的特点，同时牧主与地主也不相同，在牧区废除封建特权，实行“放牧自由”以后，牧主的剥削基本上是资本主义性质的，因之，保存牧主经济，实行牧工、牧主两利政策，并鼓励其发展生产的积极性，对发展牧区经济来说，不是有害而是有利的。执行这一政策的结果，动员了牧区各阶层人民都来发展生产，牲畜头数迅速增加。实践证明，这一政策是正确的。
    在发展畜牧业中，在农业区、半农半牧区、牧业区都曾经批判和反对过“重农轻牧”与“牧业落后论”的错误思想倾向。持有这种错误思想的同志，忽视畜牧业生产，不重视农牧结合的重要性。他们机械地认为从历史上看游牧经济转变为农业经济是一种进步，因而就认为今天的畜牧业生产不改变为农业是没有前途的，这些同志不了解由于现在社会经济分工的更加细密和国家人民都迫切需要大量的牲畜和畜产品，因而畜牧业生产的前途，无论目前和将来，都是非常光明和远大的。因此在农业区必须实现农牧结合，在牧区必须在大力发展畜牧业的同时，注意逐步发展农业，以支持牧业的进一步发展。
    牧业生产合作社  有着极大优越性
    随着自治区政治、经济、文化的不断发展，和社会主义改造运动的巨大影响，牧业区已经提出了以互助合作为中心发展畜牧业生产的问题。因此在已有牧民间的生产互助的基础上，逐步地开展了畜牧业合作化运动。目前合作社已经有一定的规模，牧业生产合作社已初步显示了极大的优越性，这些优越性是：
    第一，增加了生产，增加了社员的收入。许多合作社，牲畜的繁殖率、成活率和纯增殖率，都比互助组和个体牧民高，牲畜头数，年年增加。根据三百四十六个社的材料，增产的合作社有93％，增收的社员达到80％—90％，有的社并且做到了所有社员都增加收入。
    第二，改进了经营管理，解决了劳动力不足的困难。合作社对畜群实行了有计划的合群、分群放牧，有计划地合理地使用了牧场，改进了饲养管理。许多合作社实行了劳动规划，合理调配了劳动力，发挥了劳动力的作用。
    第三，有利于合作社的基本建设。例如：兴修水利，开辟新的牧场，培育和改良牧场，搭棚盖圈，购置新式畜牧生产工具等，合作社做到了许多个体牧民所难以做到的事情。
    第四，为多种经营创造了良好条件。不少牧业社，在以牧为主的条件下，发展了农业，建立了饲料基地。不少牧业社不但解决了饲料问题，有些社并且达到粮食自给，不再依赖从农业区输入。副业生产，在统一计划下也有发展。
    第五，推行了定居游牧，为牧区的人畜两旺创造了条件。许多合作社建社后都建设了定居地。有的种植了蔬菜和林木，有的修建了房屋改善了居住条件。有的社还开展了一些文化、卫生工作。
    第六，改进了生产技术，进行了品种改良和兽疫防治工作。不少合作社在总结自己的经验和畜牧兽医工作站的帮助下，生产技术都有改进。品种改良也取得相当成绩。
    由于显示了这些优越性，牧业生产合作社已为牧区人民所拥护，证明它是个体牧民过渡到社会主义的恰当形式。
    为了使合作化能够健康地发展，我们曾经再三强调要按牧区的民族特点，畜牧经济的特点和牧民的觉悟水平办事：
    第一，在方针、政策、步骤上，强调要在稳定发展生产的基础上进行改造，按照“稳、宽、长”的精神办事。就是政策要稳，办法要宽，步骤时间上允许因地制宜有所区别，允许以较长的时间来完成社会主义改造。在政策执行上，首要的原则是绝对遵守自愿互利的原则。入社或不入社，按照自愿，入了社退社也自由，退社再入社也欢迎；办合作社采取那种办法也按社员的意愿来决定；在照顾劳畜双方的利益上不但照顾多数人的利益，而且也要照顾少数人的利益。合作社的规模一般不宜大。
    第二，在入社办法上，强调采用群众能够理解易于接受的办法，允许群众按自愿留够自己认为需要的自留牲畜，自留数量，不加限制。目前内蒙古牧业区大量采用的是
  “基础母畜按头数入社，劳畜比例分益”的办法，这是一种群众比较习惯的办法，它可以把个人利益和集体利益紧密地结合起来，因而是可以大量推广的。“牲畜按等评分，以分入社，比例分益”的办法，也是采用较多的一种，也可以因地制宜的加以推广。还有一部分社是采取作价入社付给固定利息及其他办法。
    第三，搞好生产，保证合作社的牲畜头数逐年增加，质量逐步提高，是办好合作社的重要标志。增产的关键是执行勤俭办社和民主办社的方针，改进经营管理。报酬制度采用简单易行的包工办法，实行多劳多得的原则；在生产上执行以牧为主、农牧结合、发展多种经营的方针。
    第四，合作社的收益分配政策，必须起鼓励社内外牧民发展生产的积极作用，正确的规定劳畜分红比例。必须使牲畜多的牧户感觉到牲畜入社后，可以得到更快的发展和增加更多的收入；使劳动力多的牧户感觉到入社以后劳动力可以得到充分的发挥和得到更多的实际利益。在分配问题上，要反对降低牲畜报酬，割肥补瘦，使畜多户吃亏的偏向，也要反对不恰当的提高牲畜报酬，使畜少劳力多的户吃亏的偏向。
    第五、与发展合作社相结合，推行定居游牧。国家在扶助定居游牧上给予了合作社以援助。
    同牧主反复协商  着手改造牧主经济
    牧业社会主义改造中另一个重要部分是对牧主经济的社会主义改造。在牧业区逐步合作化的形势下，牧主经济的继续发展已经产生困难，如劳力不足、雇工困难等，这些问题如果不加以解决，会妨碍生产的继续发展。同时在全国社会主义改造高潮的影响下，牧主也有走社会主义道路的要求。根据这种实际情况，我们遵照中央对牧主和平改造的方针，经与牧主反复协商，初步着手进行典型试办工作。
    一年来对牧主经济的社会主义改造工作，我们有如下体会：
    （甲）改造牧主经济可以采用多种形式，可以办合营牧场，可以参加合作社，可由合作社代放苏鲁克（苏鲁克，蒙古语，租放牲畜的意思），可以由国营牧场代牧，还可以采取其他有利于改造又易于为牧主所接受的办法。一个牧主愿意同时采用几种办法也是可以的。暂时还不愿接受改造的，仍然允许牧主继续雇工经营，雇工生产有困难，政府仍然给以帮助。
    （乙）不论办合营牧场和参加合作社，均须根据需要和可能，根据牧主的自愿。牧主愿意改造，但国家还没有足够的人力、财力、物力支持时，可暂时不办。牧主不愿接受改造，可以暂时不改造。
    （丙）在社会主义改造中，仍然应该继续执行不斗不分，不划阶级和牧工、牧主两利政策，对牧主经济仍然保护。
    按照这些精神，我们在试办过程中注意解决了下列问题：对牧主给予适当安排，入场牧主大都担负了场长、副场长或其他适当职务；对放出的苏鲁克在合营时一般的不收回，仍由牧主自己继续分红；牲畜作价、分红、定息都协商决定，自留牲畜全按自愿；在生产上执行因陋就简勤俭经营在生产中求发展的方针。
    在牧主参加合作社方面：允许牧主担任管理委员会的委员等职务，发挥他们经营生产的特长；在入股分红问题上切实做到互利；过去放出的苏鲁克仍允许分红；自留牲畜全按自愿。
    试办的情况初步证明，试办合营牧场及个别吸收牧主参加合作社，都是牧主可以接受的办法，是有利于生产的。但由于对牧主的改造工作，尚处于摸索试办的阶段，经验和办法都十分缺乏，还有待于进一步在实践中总结经验，研究办法，以便更稳妥地进行对牧主经济的改造。（附图片）
