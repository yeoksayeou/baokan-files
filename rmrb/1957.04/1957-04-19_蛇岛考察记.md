On the morning of April 14, 1957, at six o'clock, the Snake Island Expedition, a group of twelve people, set off by motorboat for Snake Island, sixty nautical miles away. We landed a little after eleven o'clock in the morning.

The beach was full of oval pebbles, with no sign of snakes. The weather was clear that day, with temperatures between four and nine degrees Celsius and warm sunshine. The fear that everyone had before landing disappeared. Surveyors took out compasses to compare with aerial photographs, and determined that the landing point was the southeast corner of the island. Except for the southeast corner, the other seaside areas of the island are almost all cliffs. The highest point of the mountain is more than two hundred and ten meters above sea level. The island is approximately one thousand three hundred and sixty meters long and seven hundred and thirty-six meters wide.

The First Snake is Discovered

After picnicking on the beach, we were resting. Suddenly, the news photographer noticed something moving behind a rock. He looked and shouted, "There's a snake!" An animal team member quickly stepped forward with a snake clamp about four feet long and clamped the snake's head in one swift motion. This snake was a uniform earth-gray color, about two feet long, slightly thicker than a thumb, with a triangular head and a particularly thin neck. After being clamped, its abdomen contracted into a flat shape. After a moment, the snake's body wrapped around the iron clamp, writhing non-stop, its tail convulsing. Its bright red mouth opened almost at a right angle, revealing sharp fangs. Its pointed, slippery, purple tongue darted in and out. People then put it in a wire snake cage. It curled up into a ball, making squeaking noises.

"This snake is a pit viper," said Captain Professor Wu Lü, pointing to the snake cage.

"Although it's cold now, the snakes are already out and active. We must not be careless." He also said, "The pit viper ranks first among venomous snakes. One-tenth of a gram of pit viper venom can kill a person. One gram of pit viper venom can kill a thousand rabbits or thirty thousand pigeons."

"What should we do if someone gets bitten by a snake?" Wu Lü then asked pharmacist Zhang Qingrun to speak.

Zhang Qingrun said, "If someone is bitten by a venomous snake, you must immediately tie a rope tightly above the wound, then cut open the wound with a knife to squeeze out the venom, and then quickly insert potassium permanganate into the wound to neutralize the venom. All these first-aid actions must be completed within five minutes, or it will be dangerous."

Zhang Qingrun distributed first-aid medicine to everyone, and everyone put the medicine and knife together in a pocket that could be quickly accessed.

Climbing the Mountain to Catch Snakes

Snake Island is a uniform earth-gray color. The rocks on the mountain are earth-gray, the small, multi-branched shrubs are light gray-yellow, and the venomous snakes are also dark gray. People can only find pit vipers if they pay close attention.

A news reporter was vigilantly watching his feet all the way. When his left foot was about to step on a rock, he suddenly saw a pit viper stretching out its purplish-red tongue beneath his foot. The snake was quickly captured. Seven or eight people had walked past this rock before the reporter, but no one had noticed the pit viper.

Another expedition member also found a pit viper on the shaded side of a rock. The photographer stepped forward quietly and started the camera. Professor Wu Lü then quietly walked up from behind the snake. Another one caught! At the same time as Wu Lü caught the snake, everyone noticed that another very thin pit viper was also living under a rock behind his feet. It also did not escape the grasp of the people.

On the 14th, the expedition caught a total of six pit vipers during the afternoon hike.

Past Exploration Records

The weather in Northeast China is cold. It has only been a little over a month since the "Awakening of Insects," so it is not yet the season for pit vipers to be very active. However, according to a translated copy of a record of a Japanese expedition to Snake Island on September 10, 1932, the weather in Lushun and Dalian in September was hot. At that time, an expedition member wrote: "It's simply a boundless sea of snakes. People with neurasthenia might go crazy walking through the most terrifying snake crowd." "A little carelessness, and one foot will step on one or two snakes..."

We also met Wang Kelie and Wang Shuguang, middle school teachers from Dalian, who had been to Snake Island in the summer of 1949. They said that there were many snakes on the island, but not so many that there was "no place to put your feet."

Venomous snakes are a good medicine for leprosy patients. The Dalian Leprosy Sanatorium once captured more than six hundred pit vipers from the edge of this island and made medicinal wine for treatment, with more than 98% of patients experiencing positive results. Snake skins can be used to make beautiful decorations and musical instruments. The venom of venomous snakes can also be used to treat other diseases. Therefore, Snake Island is a dangerous island, but it is also an island that can bring benefits to the people and give hope to leprosy patients.

Animal Struggles on the Island

On the morning of the 15th, the weather was gloomy and the waves were high. Flocks of seagulls swept over the splashing white waves, circling low in the air. The expedition began its second day of activities.

On the mountain, many eagles were flying slowly close to the trees and grass, looking for food. The day before, the expedition had found many incomplete eagle carcasses and other bird bones on the mountain. The next day, people found a complete rat's head under a rock. From the looks of it, the rat had been bitten to death in the last few days.

It is speculated that the discovered eagles, rats, and other birds that landed on the island were all delicacies for the pit vipers. People from a health school in Dalian once conducted an experiment on captured pit vipers. They put a small bird about three or four feet away in front of a pit viper. The snake jumped fiercely, bit the bird, and then retreated. After poisoning the bird, it went back to devour it.

The eagle carcasses appeared to have died from venom poisoning during a fight between the eagles and pit vipers. Eagles are large, and pit vipers cannot swallow them whole, so they suck their blood. Eagles are formidable enemies of snakes on the island, and swooping eagles may also eat snakes.

Safe Return Voyage

It was almost time to return. Before setting sail, Professor Wu Lü was still worried, but after checking, the numbers were all correct.

In fact, it was not just a few people who were concerned about the safety of the Snake Island Expedition. After the news of the Snake Island Expedition was announced, the Dalian Science and Technology Popularization Association received letters from many places across the country. Wu Shanqiang, the grandson of Wu Yutang, the famous "Snake King Man" from Guangzhou, wrote that he had dealt with snakes for many years and was willing to go to Snake Island with the expedition. Wang Hui from Nanjing introduced a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner from Nantong who had medicine to treat snake venom. Soldiers of the People's Liberation Army Air Force sent aerial photographs of Snake Island. An old farmer from Haicheng County came up with many methods to defend against venomous snakes for the expedition...

The expedition brought back a total of nine pit vipers this time. Professor Wu Lü said with a smile: "We want to study these snakes. Now that they are locked in cages, they have to do what we tell them."

    蛇岛考察记
    新华社记者　鲁牧农　徐家柱
    1957年4月14日早晨六时，蛇岛考察队一行十二人乘机轮动身前往六十浬外的蛇岛。上午十一时多登岸。
    海滩上满是楕圆形的鹅卵石，看不到蛇的迹象。那天天气晴朗，气温在摄氏四度到九度，阳光温暖。大家上岸前的恐惧心理消失了。测量人员拿出罗盘仪对照航空摄影的图片，知道登岸的地点是岛屿的东南角。除东南角外，岛的其他靠海的地方几乎都是悬崖。山的最高点超出海面二百一十多公尺。岛的长度大约有一千三百六十公尺，宽度有七百三十六公尺。
    发现了第一条蛇
    在海滩上野餐完毕，正在休息。新闻摄影师忽然发现在一块岩石背后，好像有物一动，他一看，大声嚷道：“有蛇！”一个动物组组员拿着长约四尺的蛇夹快步上前，一下子就把蛇夹在夹子头上。这条蛇全身土灰色，约两尺多长，比姆指头粗一些，脑袋是三角形的，颈部特别细。它被夹住后，腹部收缩成扁平状。一会儿，蛇身绕在铁夹上，不停地扭舞，尾部在痉挛。它鲜红的嘴张得几乎成直角，露出锐利的毒牙。尖滑的、紫色的舌头伸吐着。人们接着把它关进铁丝制成的蛇笼。它卷缩成一团，发出吱吱的叫声。
    “这条蛇是蝮蛇，”队长伍律教授指着蛇笼说，
    “现在虽然冷，蛇已经出来活动了。千万不能大意。”他还说，“蝮蛇在毒蛇中占第一把交椅。十分之一克的蝮蛇毒液就能毒死人。一克的蝮蛇毒液，能毒死一千只兔子或三万只鸽子。”
    “万一人被蛇咬了，怎么办？”伍律接着请药剂师张清润讲话。
    张清润说：“万一被毒蛇咬了，必须立刻用绳子把伤口上部扎住，然后用刀子切开伤口把毒液挤出，再用过锰酸钾很快塞进伤口，才可以把毒性解掉。这一切急救动作，必须在五分钟内做完，不然就会发生危险。”
    张清润向每个人分发了急救药，大家把药和刀子一起放在能够迅速拿出的口袋里。
    登山捕蛇
    蛇岛上一片土灰的颜色。山头的岩石是土灰色的，矮小多枝的灌木是浅灰黄色的，而毒蛇也是深灰色的。人们只有注意察看，才能发现蝮蛇。
    一个新闻记者一路上警惕地注视着他的脚下，当他的左脚快要踩在一块岩石上时，突然看到一条蝮蛇正在脚下伸缩着紫红色的舌头。这条蛇很快就被捕住了。在这位记者的前面，有七、八个人曾经从这块岩石旁边走过，可是谁也没有发现这条蝮蛇。
    另一位考察队员也在岩石阴暗面发现一条蝮蛇，摄影师轻步上前对它开动了摄影机。伍律教授然后从蛇的背后悄悄地走来。又捉住了一条！也就在伍律捉蛇的同时，大家发现他脚后的一块岩石下还栖息着另一条很细的蝮蛇，它也没有逃脱人们的手掌。
    14日，考察队在一个下午登山的路途中，共捉到了六条蝮蛇。
    过去的探险记录
    东北的天气寒冷，“惊蛰”过去也才一个多月，所以现在还不是蝮蛇大量活动的季节。但据日本人在1932年9月10日上蛇岛探险的记录抄译本记载，旅大9月的天气炎热，当时一个探险队员写道：“简直是一望无际的蛇群。神经衰弱的人，走在最可怕的蛇群中，要发狂也说不定。”“稍一疏忽，一脚就会踏在一两条蛇上……”
    我们还遇到过1949年夏天到过蛇岛的旅大市的中学教师王克烈和王曙光。他们说，岛上的蛇是很多的，但并不是多得“连插足的地方也没有。”
    毒蛇是麻疯病人的良药。旅大麻疯疗养所曾从这个岛屿的边沿上，捕捉了六百多条蝮蛇，制成药酒进行治疗，有98％以上的病人收到了效果。蛇皮可以制作美丽的装饰品和乐器。毒蛇的毒汁还可以治疗别的疾病。因此说，蛇岛是一个危险的岛，同时也是一个能给人民带来利益，能给麻疯病人以希望的岛。
    岛上动物的斗争
    15日早晨，天气阴沉，海浪很大。成群的海鸥擦过迸溅着的白色浪花，在低空盘旋。考察队开始了第二天的活动。
    山上，许多鹰贴着树和草缓飞寻食。前一天，考察队在山上发现了许多残缺不全的鹰尸和其他鸟骨。第二天，人们又在石头下找到了一颗完整的鼠头，从外表看来，这只鼠是最近几天才被咬死的。
    据推测，被发现的鹰、鼠和其他一些停落在岛上的飞鸟，都是蝮蛇的美餐。旅大市一个卫生学校的人们曾经对捉到的蝮蛇作过一次实验。他们把一只小鸟放在蝮蛇前面大约有三、四尺远的地方，蛇就凶猛地跃过去，把小鸟咬了一口后退了回来，待毒死对方以后，再去吞食它。
    鹰尸看来是在鹰和蝮蛇搏斗时中了毒液才死亡的。鹰体大，蝮蛇不能把它整个吞下去，就吸它的血。鹰在岛上是蛇的劲敌，飞鹰冲下来，也可能把蛇吃掉。
    安全返航
    就要返航了。开船前，伍律教授还是不放心，但查点了一下，人数是齐的。
    其实，关心蛇岛考察队安全的，不只是少数人。当组织蛇岛考察队的消息传出后，旅大市科学技术普及协会收到了来自全国许多地方的信。广州市著名的“蛇王满”吴玉堂的孙子吴善强来信说，他跟蛇打了多年交道，愿和考察队同去蛇岛。南京市的王辉介绍了南通市一个中医有治蛇毒的药物。人民解放军空军战士寄来了蛇岛的空中摄影图。海城县的一个老农民为考察队设想了许多防御毒蛇的方法……。
    考察队这次共带回了九条蝮蛇。伍律教授笑着说：“我们要研究这些蛇。现在它们被关在笼子里，只好随我们摆布了。”（附图片）
