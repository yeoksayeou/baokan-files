A Brief Discussion on "Small Operas"
Zhao Shuli

I've seen two泗州 (Sizhou) opera performances in the past few days, which has brought back my feelings from when I used to watch small operas. The small operas I've seen in various places have almost always shared two common characteristics: First, although the stories of these operas are very simple, they often have a bit of a romantic element—though not many thrilling moments, they are full of whimsical ideas, often making people feel that they are pleasant and delightful. Second, the arias in these operas are sometimes so simple that they only have two lines, but even those two lines can be captivating, making you feel as if you are boating on a calm lake, without any effort, and your mood naturally sways with the plot. If someone has been in a monotonous environment for a long time and wants to use drama to greatly invigorate themselves, these small operas may not be able to achieve that effect; but if you watch these small operas after work with a relaxed attitude, you can get a gentle, joyful and educational experience. In the past, during temple fairs, these small operas often performed opposite big operas. Under normal circumstances, they each had their own audience, but when a particularly good small opera troupe came along, they could beat the big opera troupe—naturally, a particularly good big opera troupe could also beat the small opera troupe.

Some comrades think that small operas are only primitive things, and that they cannot stand without being immediately enriched and developed. I think this view is worth discussing. I admit that every opera (drama type), regardless of size, has room for enrichment and development, but it must start from its own existing foundation and develop according to its own developmental laws. Those involved should neither disrespect their foundation nor be overzealous. Respecting the foundation means first recognizing the strengths of tradition. For example, the泗州 (Sizhou) opera performances of "Night Visit," "Longing," "Beating the Dry Stick," and "Stopping the Horse" in recent days, despite the occasional errors and misprints in the lyrics that need to be corrected, are the kind of scripts that professional writers like me cannot write. If someone gave me these scripts and asked me to make major changes to enrich them, I would refuse, because I feel that these scripts lack nothing. If I disregard the original foundation and want to take the opportunity to show off my talent, I would stir things up, create some new poems to replace the original lyrics, add some scenery such as walls, dog houses, pavilions, pine forests, and taverns, add an orchestra, and add some sound effects of wind, rain, cars, and horses... In this way, it would be richer, but I would not watch it myself anymore, because the Central Experimental Opera House is even richer than their household, so I might as well go there to watch. Not being overzealous means not taking artistic creation too easily. A successful traditional program is often completed after generations of creation by teachers and apprentices. Even if we live in this happy era, mastering scientific methods and accepting the legacy of our predecessors, it would still take three years from writing (or adapting) a script to rehearsing and performing a good opera that is similar to a successful traditional program, which is already many times faster than the ancients; if you want to completely renovate all the traditional repertoire of a drama type in one year, enriching and developing it all, it will often end up completely unrecognizable. Some drama types have already taken some detours in this regard, and now, they are gradually turning back. From the泗州 (Sizhou) opera programs I mentioned, there is no such problem yet.

I hope that all local small operas can maintain their "small opera" style in development. Everyone agrees that local small operas are easy to perform modern content, but even when performing modern content, there should be a limit—perform more operas like "Sister-in-Law Li's Remarriage," and leave the adaptation of operas like "Ten Thousand Waters, Thousand Mountains" to the big operas to figure out.

    “小戏”小谈
    赵树理
    近几天来看了两场泗州戏，又唤回我从前看小戏的心情。我看过的地方小戏，差不多都有两个共同的特点：第一、这些戏的故事虽然都很单纯，却往往都有点浪漫成分——惊心动魄之处虽然不多，而异想天开的部分却不少，常使人觉着娓娓动听、触手成趣。第二、这些戏的唱腔，有时候简单到只有上下两句，但就那两句也能引人入迷，听进去好像在一个平静的湖面上泛舟，一点也用不着吃力，心情自然随着剧情荡漾起来。一个人要是在一个平淡的环境中待久了，想借戏剧来大大振奋一下，这些小戏不能起到那种作用；若是在劳动之后，抱着休息的心情去看这些小戏，却能得到和风细雨式的愉悦和教益。在从前的庙会上，这些小戏常和大戏对台演，在平常情况下是各有各的观众，而遇上了特殊好的小戏班社也能把大戏对输了——自然是特殊好的大戏班社也能把小戏对输了。
    有些同志一看见小戏就以为那只是原始性的东西，要不马上丰富一番、发展一番就站不住，我以为这种看法还有值得商量之处。我承认戏（剧种）无论大小，都有它可以丰富和发展之处，不过都要从它自己的现有基础出发，顺着它自己发展的规律去发展，当事者既不应该不尊重它们的基础，又不应该操之过切。所谓尊重基础，先要认识传统方面的长处。例如近几天来泗州戏演出的“夜访”、“思盼”、“打干棒”、“拦马”等节目，尽管在词句方面偶然还有一些传错、钞错的地方须待校正，但这一类剧本还不是像我这样的专业写作者所能写得成的。假如有人把这些剧本交给我让我大拆大改来丰富它一番，我便要抗命，因为我觉着这些剧本中不缺少什么东西。假如我不顾人家原有的基础，想趁势露一露我的才华，我就重新翻腾一下，作上一些新的诗句把人家的唱词换掉，布置上一些围墙、狗窝、楼台、松林、酒店等景色，加上管弦乐队，加上一些风雨车马声音的效果……这样一来，富则富矣，可是要我自己去看我是不会再看的，因为中央实验歌剧院要比他们的家当还富，我不如上那里看去。所谓不要操之过切，就是说不要把艺术创造看得太容易了。一个成功的传统节目，往往都是经过师徒几代的创造才完成的。就算我们生在这幸福的时代，既掌握了科学方法，又接受了前人遗产，然而从创作（或改编）剧本到排练上演，三年能完成一个同成功的传统节目差不多的好戏，已经比古人快了好多倍了；要是想在一年中把一个剧种的传统剧目全部翻修一遍，都把它丰富、发展一番，往往能弄得面目全非。有些剧种已经在这方面走了一些弯路，现在，才又逐渐扭转回来，从我举的那几个泗州戏的节目看来尚无此病。
    我希望所有的地方小戏在发展中都能保有它的“小戏”风格。大家一致公认地方小戏容易表演现代内容，不过就是演现代内容也还应该有点限度好——多演“李二嫂改嫁”之类的戏，而把改编“万水千山”等戏的事让给大戏去想办法。（附图片）
