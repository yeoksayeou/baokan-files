Starting from Technology to Save Raw Materials
The Rolling Stock Industry Can Build 500 More 50-Ton Open-Top Wagons
Metal Utilization Rate Increased in Many Mechanical and Electrical Factories in Shenyang

(By this newspaper) The Rolling Stock Industry Administration Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry has, based on the characteristics of rolling stock products, formulated specific measures for increasing production and saving resources from a technical perspective. This will save the country a large amount of steel and wood.

In terms of design: Efforts will be made to reduce the weight of products, continue to increase the use of general-purpose parts and standard parts, simplify structures, seek the best alternative materials, and adopt reasonable safety factors. At the same time, the utilization rate of domestically produced steel plates and sections will be increased. It is initially estimated that, based on this year's production level, a total of more than 4,000 to 5,300 tons of metal materials and 2,100 cubic meters of wood can be saved annually, with a savings value of 2.5 million yuan.

In terms of technological work, it is expected that improvements will be made by reducing defective products, reducing machining allowances, reducing molten iron consumption, using a large amount of scrap iron and steel to replace pig iron for casting, reducing blank volume, strengthening material management, continuing to promote material allocation according to sets, quota-based material requisition, and adjusting production lines. Each locomotive can save about two tons of metal materials. In addition to the amount saved by passenger and freight cars, a total of more than 2,300 tons of metal materials can be saved this year.

In terms of revising product technical conditions, the phenomenon of large-scale waste of wood caused by the unreasonable technical conditions in the past has been resolutely eliminated. It is estimated that the timber yield will increase by more than 10%, which can save the country 11,500 cubic meters of wood.

Comprehensive above measures, it is estimated that more than 6,700 tons of steel and other metal materials and 13,500 cubic meters of wood will be saved this year. Together with the savings in other production management costs, a total of 7 million yuan can be saved for the country this year. This money can be used to manufacture 500 50-ton open-top wagons.

(By this newspaper) Some state-owned machinery and electrical factories in Shenyang City have improved the metal utilization rate and saved steel. The improvement of the metal utilization rate is mostly the result of adopting new technologies and reducing the material consumption quota.

The Technology Section of the Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Factory recently conducted a meticulous review of the material quota of all products. After modification, the material utilization rate of the vertical drilling machine products increased from 74% to 78%; the radial drilling machine products increased from 74% to 80%. Calculated after reviewing all products, 262 tons of steel can be saved throughout the year. The Technology Section of the Pneumatic Tool Factory reviewed the material quota of five products, which can save 280 tons of steel throughout the year. The Mining Machinery Factory adopted advanced technology material quota, and 115 tons of steel can be saved annually from only three products such as disc feeders.

Some units pay special attention to rare and valuable materials, adopt the most reasonable methods to implement set cutting, and try to reduce scraps to improve the material utilization rate. The Transformer Factory implemented advanced set cutting methods, which increased the utilization rate of silicon steel sheets from 60% to 80%, which can save more than 90,000 yuan of wealth throughout the year; after improving the set cutting methods of insulating cardboard and copper plates, more than 20,000 yuan of materials can also be saved. Some factories, without affecting product quality and with the consent of users, use alternative materials. After research, the hollow large shaft of the spiral classifier of the Mining Machinery Factory uses iron plate welding instead of seamless steel pipes. Calculated according to the annual output, the material cost can be reduced by 140,000 yuan throughout the year.

Some units have also adopted new processing methods, reducing labor consumption. The Heavy Machinery Factory improved the processing procedures of some products, reducing the labor volume per unit by 17% to 20%. The Mining Machinery Factory saved more than 2,000 hours of machine processing by improving the processing methods of only one gas generator. With the addition of other improvements, the product cost was reduced by 14,000 yuan. (Attached picture)

Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory designers go deep into practice in the march towards science and understand the performance of their products. This is the situation of understanding the gas generator designed by themselves at the Shenyang Cable Factory.

    从技术着手节约原材料
    机车车辆工业可多造五十吨敞车五百辆
    沈阳许多机械电机工厂金属利用率提高
    本报讯　第一机械工业部机车车辆工业管理局已根据机车车辆工业产品的特点从技术方面着手订出具体增产节约措施，将给国家节约大批钢材和木材。
    在设计方面：努力减轻产品的重量，继续增加通用件、标准件，简化结构，寻求最好的代用材料，采用合理的安全系数。同时，加大国产钢板和型钢的利用率，这样，按今年的生产水平，初步估计，一年共可节约金属材料四千多吨到五千三百吨，木材两千一百立方公尺，节约价值达二百五十万元。
    在工艺工作方面，预计从减少废品、减少加工余量、降低铁水消耗量、大量利用钢铁屑代替生铁熔铸，以及减少毛坯体积、加强材料管理，继续推行套材下料、限额领料、调整生产流水线等方面努力改进，每台机车约可节约金属材料两吨左右，加上客、货车节约的数量，今年共可节约金属材料两千三百多吨。
    在修改产品技术条件方面，坚决消除了以往技术条件的不够合理所造成的木材大量浪费现象。估计木材的成材率将提高10％以上，可以为国家节省木材一万一千五百立方公尺。
    综合上述措施，预计今年将能节约钢材和其他金属材料六千七百多吨，木材一万三千五百立方公尺，连同节约其他生产管理方面的费用，今年共可为国家节约七百万元。用这些钱可制造五十吨的敞车五百辆。
    本报讯　沈阳市一些国营机械电机工厂，提高金属利用率，节约钢铁。金属利用率的提高，大部分是采用新技术，降低原材料消耗定额的结果。
    沈阳第二机床厂工艺科最近一个时期对全部产品的材料定额作了细致审查，经过修正，产品立钻的材料利用率由74％提高到78％；摇臂钻产品由74％提高到80％。从全部产品审查后计算，全年可节约钢铁二百六十二吨。风动工具厂工艺科审查了五种产品的材料定额，全年可省二百八十吨钢铁。矿山机器厂采用了先进的技术材料定额，仅从元盘给料机等三种产品上一年可节约一百十五吨钢材。
    有些单位对稀有贵重材料尤为重视，采用了最合理的方法实行套裁，尽量减少边角料头，以提高材料利用率。变压器厂实行先进的套裁方法，使矽钢片的利用率由60％提高到80％全年可省九万多元财富；改进绝缘纸板和铜板套裁方法之后，也可节约二万多元的材料。有的厂在不影响产品质量和用户的同意下，采用代用材料，矿山机器厂的螺旋分级机空心大轴经过研究，用铁板焊接代替无缝钢管按年产量计算全年可降低材料费十四万元。
    有些单位还采取了新的加工方法，压缩了劳动消耗量，重型机器厂改进了一部分产品加工工序，使每台劳动量压缩了17％到20％。矿山机器厂仅一台煤气发生炉改进加工方法，就节省了机器加工二千多小时。加上其他方面改进，使产品成本降低一万四千元。（附图片）
