    Welcoming Romanian Brothers: Enhancing Sino-Romanian Friendship and Cooperation
    Liu Shaoqi's Welcome Speech at Beijing Airport
    Dear Comrade Constantin Pîrvulescu, dear comrades of the entire delegation:
    Today, we are welcoming the envoys of the great Romanian people – the delegation of the Grand National Assembly of the Romanian People's Republic and the Bucharest City People's Council – who have come from afar, with extremely pleasant and cordial feelings. Please allow me, on behalf of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China and all the Chinese people, to extend our heartfelt and warm welcome to our distinguished guests, and through you, to express our highest respect to the fraternal Romanian people.
    In the twelve years since liberation, under the leadership of the glorious Romanian Workers' Party and the government, the people of all nationalities in Romania have achieved significant accomplishments in the cause of building socialism and safeguarding world peace. The Chinese people are delighted and encouraged by the various achievements of the Romanian People's Republic.
    The brotherly friendly and cooperative relations between the Chinese and Romanian peoples have greatly developed in the past few years. Our two countries have repeatedly sent delegations to each other for friendly visits. In 1954, we had the honor of receiving Comrade Groza, Chairman of the Presidium of the Grand National Assembly of the Romanian People's Republic. Not long ago, the delegation of our National People's Congress visited Romania and received a warm welcome and cordial hospitality from the Romanian Workers' Party, the government of the Romanian People's Republic, the Grand National Assembly, and the people. We are very moved and grateful. Now we are very honored to have the opportunity to welcome the delegation of the Grand National Assembly of Romania and the Bucharest City People's Council to visit our country. The mutual visits of the parliamentary delegations of the two countries powerfully demonstrate the close friendship between our two brotherly peoples.
    Dear Comrade Constantin Pîrvulescu, your delegation from the Grand National Assembly of the Romanian People's Republic and the Bucharest City People's Council to our country will further develop and consolidate the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Romanian peoples, promote close cooperation between the parliaments of China and Romania, and will be conducive to the unity of socialist countries and the cause of world peace.
    Dear distinguished guests, we once again extend our warm welcome to you.
    Long live the eternal brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Romanian peoples!
    Long live the unity and cooperation between the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union!
    Long live the Romanian People's Republic!
    Long live world peace!

    Pîrvulescu's Speech
    Dear comrades:
    Please allow me, on behalf of the Grand National Assembly of the Romanian People's Republic, to sincerely thank you for the warm welcome you have given us, which has deeply moved us.
    On behalf of the Grand National Assembly of the Romanian People's Republic and all the Romanian people, I extend warm brotherly greetings to the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China and to the talented Chinese people who are victoriously carrying out the great socialist construction under the wise leadership of the heroic Chinese Communist Party. The Romanian people follow with great interest the tremendous achievements made by the fraternal Chinese people, and we sincerely congratulate you on these achievements, just as we would on our own victories.
    The contribution of the People's Republic of China to the cause of maintaining peace in Asia and the world is an important factor among all forces striving for peace.
    The brotherly friendship between the Romanian and Chinese peoples is strong and unbreakable. Cooperation between our two countries in the political, economic, and cultural fields is becoming increasingly close.
    We feel very honored to be able to respond to the invitation of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, following the visit of the delegation of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China headed by Comrade Peng Zhen to our country last year, and to have the opportunity to visit your beautiful country, directly understand the significant achievements made by the Chinese people on the road of socialism, in the construction of political power, and in economic, social, and cultural construction, and to strengthen the ties between our two peoples and our two parliaments.
    We are convinced that our visit to your country and our meetings with representatives of the Chinese people and the working people of People's China will give us the opportunity to learn more from your advanced experience, and will greatly promote the closer friendly cooperation between our two peoples who are fighting under the banner of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, within the great socialist camp, for the victory of peace and socialism.
    Long live the great Chinese people!
    Long live the powerful socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and People's China!
    Long live the friendship between the great Chinese people and the Romanian people!

    欢迎罗马尼亚兄弟　增进中罗友好合作
    刘少奇在北京机场的欢迎词亲爱的康·帕伏列斯库同志，亲爱的代表团全体同志们：
    今天，我们怀着十分愉快而亲切的心情迎接远道而来的伟大的罗马尼亚人民的使者——罗马尼亚人民共和国大国民议会和布加勒斯特市人民会议代表团。请允许我代表中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会和全中国人民向我们的贵宾们表示衷心的热烈的欢迎，并通过你们向兄弟的罗马尼亚人民表示崇高的敬意。
    罗马尼亚各族人民在解放以来的十二年中，在光荣的罗马尼亚工人党和政府的领导下，在建设社会主义和维护世界和平的事业中，取得了重大的成就。中国人民对于罗马尼亚人民共和国的各项成就感到欢欣鼓舞。
    中罗两国人民兄弟般的友好合作关系，在过去几年中有了很大的发展，我们两国曾多次派遣代表团相互进行友好访问。1954年我们荣幸地接待了罗马尼亚人民共和国大国民议会主席团主席格罗查同志，不久以前我全国人民代表大会代表团访问了罗马尼亚，受到罗马尼亚工人党、罗马尼亚人民共和国政府、大国民议会和人民热烈的欢迎和亲切款待，我们非常感动和感谢。现在我们有机会欢迎前来我国访问的罗马尼亚大国民议会和布加勒斯特市人民会议代表团感到非常荣幸。两国议会代表团的相互访问有力地表示了我们两国兄弟人民之间的亲密友谊。
    亲爱的康·帕伏列斯库同志，以你为首的罗马尼亚人民共和国大国民议会和布加勒斯特市人民会议代表团来我国的访问，将进一步发展和巩固中、罗两国人民之间的兄弟友谊，促进中、罗两国议会之间的密切合作并将有利于社会主义各国的团结和世界和平事业。
    亲爱的贵宾们，我们再一次向你们表示热烈的欢迎。
    中、罗两国人民之间的永恒的兄弟友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义各国之间的团结和合作万岁！
    罗马尼亚人民共和国万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
    帕伏列斯库的讲话亲爱的同志们：
    请允许我代表罗马尼亚人民共和国大国民议会衷心地感谢你们为我们所作的使我们深受感动的热烈欢迎。
    我代表罗马尼亚人民共和国大国民议会以及全体罗马尼亚人民对中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会以及在英勇的中国共产党的英明领导下胜利地进行着伟大的社会主义建设的天才的中国人民致以热烈的兄弟般的敬礼。罗马尼亚人民以极大的兴趣注视着兄弟般的中国人民所获得的巨大成就，并衷心地祝贺你们所取得的这些成就，就像我们自己所取得的胜利一样。
    中华人民共和国对于维护亚洲以及世界和平事业的贡献，是所有为和平而奋斗的力量当中的一个重要因素。
    罗马尼亚人民和中国人民兄弟般的友谊是强大的，是牢不可破的。我们两国之间在政治、经济和文化各方面的合作都越来越密切。
    我们感到十分荣幸，能够应中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会的邀请，回答去年以彭真同志为首的中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会代表团在我国的访问，而有机会拜访你们美丽的国家，直接了解中国人民在社会主义的道路上、在政权建设上、在经济和社会、文化建设上所获得的重大成就，并加强我们两国人民和我们两国议会之间的联系。
    我们深信，我们在你们国家的访问以及同中国人民的代表和人民中国的劳动人民的会见将会使我们有机会更多地学习你们的先进经验，将会大大地促使在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的旗帜下、在伟大的社会主义阵营中为和平和社会主义事业的胜利而奋斗的我们两国人民之间的友好合作更加密切。
    伟大的中国人民万岁！
    以苏联和人民中国为首的强大的社会主义阵营万岁！
    伟大的中国人民和罗马尼亚人民之间的友谊万岁！
