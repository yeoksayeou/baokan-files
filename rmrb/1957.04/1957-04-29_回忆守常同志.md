    Remembering Comrade Shouchang
    Zhu Wushan
    April 28, 1957, marked the thirtieth anniversary of the martyrdom of Comrade Li Shouchang (Li Dazhao), one of the founders of the Chinese Communist Party. Zhang Zuolin took our Comrade Shouchang's life on this day thirty years ago. However, Comrade Shouchang's glorious cause, along with that of thousands upon thousands of other comrades who followed in his footsteps and fought heroically, finally achieved a great victory under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao.
    I met Comrade Shouchang in the spring of 1920, and until I went abroad at the end of 1925, we were almost inseparable. At that time, he was the director of the Peking University Library, and I was a student at Peking University. Influenced by the "New Thought Movement" of the time, I went to the library to talk to Comrade Shouchang, asking him to recommend some works on Marxism. He happily accepted my request, invited me to sit in the chair opposite his desk, and talked to me about many academic and ideological issues. After the conversation, he took out his essay "My View on Marxism," which he had published in "New Youth," from a bookshelf next to his desk that was piled with books and periodicals, asking me to offer my opinions after reading it. He also gave me several books on Marxism by Kawakami Hajime and an English translation of a booklet written by Lenin. He said to me as he saw me out of the library, "Return this English translation of the booklet to me after you have read it, and do not lend it to others." Because at that time, whoever kept Lenin's works was suspected of being a Bolshevik. My first meeting with Comrade Shouchang left a very deep impression on me. He truly loved young people, especially those who were studying Marxism, which was completely different from some of the so-called famous scholars at Peking University at that time.
    At that time, in participating in student movements and socio-political activities, I met Deng Zhongxia, He Mengxiong, and those who later became traitors, Zhang Guotao, Luo Zhanglong, and others. Through the introduction of Comrades Shouchang and Zhongxia, I participated in the discussions to initiate the organization of the Peking University Marxist Theory Research Association. Comrade Shouchang also participated in this discussion. I remember Comrade Shouchang wearing a blue cloth gown, wearing glasses, and sitting at the corner of a table, listening to our discussion. We asked him how many lectures he could give each month, and he smiled slightly and said, "I can do as many as you want, but we should also invite other professors who are willing to participate." Once, we held a debate at Peking University, with the topic "Is Socialism Suitable for China?" This debate lasted for several days, and participants included teachers and students from various universities and specialized schools in Beijing. Comrade Shouchang was invited to be a judge at the debate. Speakers were very enthusiastic at the debate, and the arguments were intense. Finally, the audience wanted to hear the opinions of a contemporary expert on Marxism, and the hall became silent for a moment. Comrade Shouchang calmly walked onto the podium, holding a page of notes in his hand, and used the viewpoint of historical materialism to answer the question. Comrade Shouchang explained the laws of the development of human society, proving that the transition from capitalism to socialism, just like the transformation of feudalism into a capitalist society due to the development of productive forces, was a necessity that could not be controlled by human consciousness and emotion. Comrade Shouchang used Kawakami Hajime's common "for example" to illustrate this point (Comrade Shouchang was somewhat influenced by Kawakami Hajime during his study in Japan). He said, for example, before a chick hatches, it is still inside the eggshell, but when it matures, the chick must break out of the eggshell, which is a natural law. Comrade Shouchang finally said, "If the pro-socialist side uses the viewpoint of historical materialism to answer this question, it will be easier to refute the opposition. But when I say that socialism will inevitably come, it does not mean that the working class can wait for the arrival of socialism without struggle..." When Comrade Shouchang spoke, his voice was not loud, but his words showed a supreme degree of confidence. After the meeting, Comrade Shouchang's conclusion at this debate aroused the interest of most of the audience in studying Marxism. Since then, the number of members in the Marxist Research Association has increased by dozens.
    Comrade Shouchang was usually modest and amiable, and his life was very simple and frugal. He was sincere to others and often helped others out of his own meager means. When comrades or workers sought help from him, Comrade Shouchang always found ways to help, even when he was in difficulty himself.
    When we went to Shouchang's home for business or meetings, he poured tea and water himself. Although everything in his home was simple and ordinary, his study was not small, and he had many old books, as well as many foreign language books. Once, I found an English translation of Bukharin's "ABC of Communism" in his study. He said to me, "This book is very popular, and it is also beneficial to read it," and he gave me the book at that time. Comrade Shouchang was also very concerned about the unity of comrades. Once, Comrade Deng Zhongxia had a conflict with a certain comrade at work and they started arguing. Shouchang, through Comrade Cai Hesen, called Zhongxia and several other comrades to his home to explain, and finally the quarrel was settled. He was very modest and amiable to his colleagues, regardless of which party they belonged to, but he did not give in when protecting the interests of our party's work and our comrades. For example, in the early days of the founding of the Beijing "Minbao" (People's Daily) newspaper, I served as an editor there. Later, because I continuously published Lenin's "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism" in the "Economic Column" of the newspaper, it aroused the dissatisfaction of Gu Mengyu, who proposed to dismiss me. Comrade Shouchang flatly rejected Gu's proposal and said, "Wu Shan is doing a very good job as an editor at the newspaper, and there is no need to replace him."
    In early February 1923, due to the strike of the Jinghan Railway workers, I went to Wuhan in the name of a representative of the Beijing Student Union. Here, through the relationship of Comrades Chen Tanqiu and Xia Zhixu, I found Comrade Shouchang. At this time, Comrade Shouchang was giving lectures on historical materialism in various universities in Wuhan. When I saw him, his appearance was very different from before. His face was pale, and his beard seemed darker than before. He was with Li Hanjun, probably talking about the "February 7th" massacre. When he saw me, he said to me with concern, "I was just about to look for you..." He said, "The government has already noticed your activities in Wuhan. Last night there was a rumor that there was news of the arrest of Beijing student representatives. You should be careful..." Afterwards, we also participated in the conversation between Comrade Shouchang and Comrade Li Hanjun. We analyzed in detail the course of the "February 7th" incident. Comrade Shouchang said with great indignation, "We have long recognized that Wu Peifu is exactly the same as other Chinese warlords. We previously accepted Bai Jianwu's (Wu Peifu's political adviser, Shouchang's old classmate) opinion and sent our comrades to work on various railways, and did not believe in Wu Peifu's so-called labor protection policy..." At that time, I did not know that some individual comrades thought that Comrade Shouchang trusted Marshal Wu too much and said that he had right-leaning thoughts. This is completely inconsistent with the facts.
    Comrade Shouchang was most loyal to Marxism-Leninism and the cause of the working class. Reading "The Victory of the Common People," "The New Century," "Class Competition and Mutual Aid," "My View on Marxism," "Re-discussion on Problems and -isms"...we can see how Comrade Shouchang yearned for the victory of the October Revolution and hated imperialism and its running dogs while promoting Marxism in the early days. I also remember that Comrade Shouchang participated in several international workers' conferences. After each participation, his understanding of Marxism-Leninism became more in-depth, and he believed that actually participating in revolutionary activities would further increase his understanding of Marxism-Leninism.
    After 1924-1925, Comrade Shouchang resigned from some of his positions at Peking University and devoted himself to the work of the Northern District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Beijing, directly leading all social movements and workers' and peasants' movements in the North...all party work. From this time on, we were often together with Comrade Shouchang in the District Committee. If before this Comrade Shouchang's writing and propaganda were mostly devoted to the general basic principles of Marxism, then after leading the actual work of the party, Comrade Shouchang began to focus on studying the actual problems and strategies of the Chinese revolution and the party based on Marxism-Leninism. We can understand this by reading several essays written by Comrade Shouchang in 1926, such as "Sun Yat-sen's Position in the History of the Chinese National Revolution," "The Recent Strategy of Japanese Imperialism's Attack on China," "Land and Peasants," "The Red Spear Society in the Provinces of Lu, Yu, and Shan," and so on. Comrade Shouchang was very busy at the District Committee, often working day and night to discuss issues and handle affairs, without any sense of fatigue. When implementing major resolutions, even movements such as mass demonstrations, Comrade Shouchang often took the lead himself when he deemed it necessary.
    For example, in 1926, Zhang Zuolin's attack on Tianjin with the support of Japanese imperialism aroused the dissatisfaction of the citizens and students of Beijing, which led to a march and demonstration in front of Tiananmen Square on March 18, resulting in the most tragic bloody massacre. Comrade Shouchang was injured in the head as a result of personally participating in guiding the masses. From then on, the Zhang Zuolin warlord group regarded Comrade Shouchang as a thorn in their side and decided to harm him. At that time, many of his comrades and friends advised him to temporarily hide away to avoid his edge. Comrade Shouchang believed that he was the leader of the party, and everything about the party was on his shoulders. If he left Beijing, then who would take on all the important tasks of the party? Therefore, Comrade Shouchang remained in Beijing, continuing his revolutionary work, even in an extremely dangerous environment. On April 9, 1927, Comrade Shouchang was finally arrested by the Feng warlords. After Comrade Shouchang was arrested, he was subjected to various tortures, but Comrade Shouchang was not afraid at all, and his integrity was awe-inspiring, so that the warlords could not get any real information at all. Even in prison, Comrade Shouchang still promoted communism and continued to lead and instruct the work of the party. At that time, not only the prisoners in the prison were greatly moved, but even the soldiers guarding the prison were willing to pass on messages for him and act as transportation personnel in the prison. At that time, the general workers, especially the comrades of the Northern Railway Workers, after learning the news of Comrade Shouchang's arrest, prepared to rob the prison to rescue Comrade Shouchang. Comrade Shouchang firmly opposed such a risky act, because he estimated the strength of the enemy and us at that time. The prison robbery plan would only cause losses to our party and weaken the revolutionary forces, without any practical benefit. Therefore, Comrade Shouchang was determined not to make useless sacrifices for himself. This kind of firm and selfless quality and style, which is for the party and not for personal gain, can be a model for future generations forever.
    From 1925 to 1926, the peasant movement was launched in various provinces in the north, such as Zhili, Henan, and Inner Mongolia. From this time on, Comrade Shouchang paid attention to studying this issue in depth, personally trained cadres, and sent them to various places to participate in the peasant movement. These works laid the foundation for the later development of the peasant movement in the north.
    In short, during the several years that I worked with Comrade Shouchang, I deeply realized that Comrade Shouchang was not only modest and amiable, and lived a simple and difficult life, but also very loyal to Marxism-Leninism and the cause of communism. For a long time, he carried out relentless struggles against all reactionary forces, such as Yuan Shikai, Gu Hongming, Lin Shu, and even Hu Shi, and organized all progressive forces in the North to implement the party's policies, so that the North had a strong revolutionary force. It cannot be said that this is Comrade Shouchang's contribution to the party.
    Comrade Shouchang has been sacrificed for thirty years, and Comrade Shouchang's cause is immortal, and his quality and excellent style of being firm for the party and not for personal gain are worth learning from us.

    回忆守常同志
    朱务善
    1957年4月28日，是中国共产党创始者之一李守常（李大钊）同志殉难的三十周年纪念日。张作霖在三十年前的这一天，夺去了我们的守常同志。但守常同志的光荣事业，还有成千上万和守常一样的同志前扑后继地英勇奋斗，终于在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，取得了伟大胜利。
    我认识守常同志是在1920年春天，到1925年末我出国以前，我们几乎朝夕未离。他那时是北大图书馆主任，我是北大学生。我受了当时“新思潮”的影响，一次到图书馆去找守常同志谈话，请他介绍几本关于马克思主义的著作。他非常高兴地接受了我的请求，让我坐在办公桌对面的椅子上，同我谈了不少学术与思想方面的问题。谈完话，他从桌旁一个堆满书刊的书架上，拿出他在“新青年”上发表的论文“我的马克思主义观”给我，要我看后提出意见，又给我几本河上肇著的关于马克思主义的著作和一本英译的列宁写的小册子。他送我出图书馆的时候还说：“这本英译的小册子你看完后交还给我，不要转借他人”。因为那时谁保存列宁的著作，谁就有布尔什维克的嫌疑。第一次和守常同志见面，给我的印象非常深刻，他确是热爱青年，特别是热爱学习马克思主义的青年，同那时北大的一些所谓名流学者相较，截然不同。
    当时我在参加学生运动和社会政治活动中，认识了邓中夏、何孟雄，以及后来变为叛徒的张国焘、罗章龙等人。由守常和中夏等同志的介绍，我参加了发启组织北大马克思学说研究会的讨论。守常同志也参加了这次讨论。我记得守常同志穿着蓝布大衫，戴着眼镜，坐在一张桌子的角上，听我们讨论。我们问他每月可以担任几次讲演，他微微地笑着说：“你们要我讲几次我都可以办到，只是还要邀请其他愿意参加的教授们参加才行”。有一次，我们在北大开辩论会，辩论的题目是“社会主义是否适合于中国”，这次辩论延长数日之久，参加的人都是北京各大学各专门学校的教员和学生，守常同志被邀请为辩论会的评判员。在辩论会上发言非常踊跃，争辩激烈。最后听众都想听一听当代马克思主义专家的意见，一时满场俱寂。守常同志不慌不忙地走上讲台，手里拿着一页笔记大纲，用唯物史观的观点来解答问题。守常同志说明了人类社会发展的规律，证明由资本主义到社会主义，正如封建制度因生产力的发展一定要转变为资本主义社会一样的必然性，非人的意识和感情所能左右的。守常同志用了河上肇所常用的“譬如”来说明这一点（守常同志在日本留学时代，多少受了河上肇的一些影响）。他说，譬如雏鸡在孵化以前，尚在卵壳以内，到孵化成熟以后，雏鸡必破卵而出，此为必然之理。守常同志最后说：“赞成派若是拿唯物史观的观点来解答这个问题，就比较容易驳倒反对派了。但我说社会主义必然到来，这并不是意味着工人阶级不要斗争就可以垂手等待社会主义的到来……”守常同志说话时，声音不大，但在话语里却表现出一种最高度的自信心。闭会后，守常同志在这次辩论会上的结论，引起了大多数听众研究马克思主义的兴趣。此后，马克思主义研究会增加的会员达数十人之多。
    守常同志平素谦虚和霭，生活又很艰苦俭朴，待人诚恳，遇人有困难，常常自节以济人，遇有同志间或工人中有人求助于他时，守常同志虽在困难之中，但总设法帮助。
    我们因事或开会到守常家去，倒茶倒水，都是他自己动手。家里一切设备虽很简陋平常，但书房并不小，藏的旧书很多，外文书籍也不少。一次我在他书房中找着了一本英译的布哈林著“共产主义入门”（ABCofcommunism）。他对我说：“这本书很通俗，看一看也有益处”，当时就把这本书送给了我。守常同志对于同志们的团结问题，也很关心。一次邓中夏同志在工作中和某一个同志发生冲突，争闹起来，守常经过蔡和森同志把中夏和其他几位同志召集到家中解释，终于使争闹平息了。他对于自己的同事，不论是属于任何党派的人，都很谦虚和霭，但在保护我党工作利益和自己同志时，毫不退让。如北京“民报”馆成立之初，我在那里充任编辑，后来因为我连续在报上“经济栏”中登载了列宁所著“帝国主义是资本主义底最高阶段”一文，引起了顾孟余的不满，提议要把我撤职。守常同志断然拒绝了顾的提议，并且说：“务善在该报作编辑工作很好，没有更换的必要。”
    1923年2月初，因京汉铁路工人罢工事，我以北京学生会代表名义到武汉。在这里我通过陈潭秋、夏之栩诸同志的关系，找到了守常同志。此时守常同志在武汉各大学讲演唯物史观。我见到他时，他的神色大非昔比，面色苍白，胡子也似乎比以前变黑了。他正在和李汉俊一起，大概在谈论“二七”惨案的情形。见我去了，他很关心地向我说：“我正要找你……”他说：“你们在武汉的活动，政府早已注意，昨晚传说有逮捕北京学生代表的消息，应该当心一些……”。随后我们也参加了守常同志和李汉俊同志的谈话。我们详细分析了“二七”事件的经过，守常同志很愤慨地说：“我们早就认定了吴佩孚和中国其他军阀完全一样，我们从前接受了白坚武（吴佩孚的政治顾问、守常的老同学）的意见，派我们的同志到各铁路上参加工作，并不相信吴佩孚的什么保护劳工政策……”。我那时还不知道有个别的同志，以为守常同志过于相信吴大帅，说他有右倾的思想。这是完全不合乎事实的。
    守常同志对于马克思列宁主义及工人阶级的事业，是最忠实的。我们读了“庶民的胜利”“新纪元”“阶级竞争与互助”“我的马克思主义观”“再论问题与主义”……就可以看到守常同志在初期宣传马克思主义的同时，就已经如何向往十月革命的胜利，憎恨帝国主义和其走卒了。我还记得守常同志曾经参加了几次国际工人会议，在每次参加会议后，对于马克思列宁主义的了解就更加深入一步，并且相信实际参加革命活动，就会更增加对马列主义的了解。
    1924—1925年以后，守常同志辞去了北大的一部分职务，专门参加了在北京的中国共产党北方区委的工作，直接领导北方所有社会运动和工农运动等……一切党的工作。从这时起，我们和守常同志在区委常在一起。如果说在这以前，守常同志的写作宣传，多致力于马克思主义一般的基本原理，那末在领导党的实际工作以后，守常同志则根据马列主义开始专心研究中国革命和党的实际问题与策略。我们现在读守常同志在1926年所著的几篇论文，如“孙中山先生在中国民族革命史上之位置”“日本帝国主义最近进攻中国的方策”“土地与农民”“鲁豫陕等省的红枪会”等等，就可以明白了。守常同志在区委时工作很忙，为讨论问题处理事务，常常夜以继日，毫无倦意。在执行重大决议时，即或群众示威游行这一类的运动，守常同志认为有必要时，也常常亲自带头参加。
    如1926年因张作霖在日本帝国主义支持之下进攻天津，引起了北京市民与学生的不满，乃于3月18日在天安门前举行游行示威，酿成了最惨酷的流血惨案。守常同志因亲自参加指导群众，以至头部受伤。自此而后，张作霖军阀集团乃视守常同志为眼中钉，决意危害守常同志，那时他的很多同志与朋友劝他暂时躲开以避其锋，守常同志认为他是党的领导人，党的一切，都放在他身上，如果他离开了北京，那么党的一切重任又有谁担负？所以守常同志虽处在极端危险的环境中，仍留在北京，继续革命工作。1927年4月9日守常同志终于被奉系军阀逮捕了。守常同志被捕后，屡受各种毒刑，但守常同志毫不畏惧，气节凛然，终使军阀一点真实消息也得不到。即在监狱中守常同志仍然宣传共产主义并继续领导指示党的工作，在当时不但狱中犯人大为感动，即看守的兵士也愿替他传递消息充当在监狱中的交通员。那时一般工友特别是北方铁路工人同志知道守常同志被捕消息之后，他们准备劫狱抢救守常同志，守常同志坚决反对这样的冒险行为，因为估计那时敌我力量，劫狱计划，只是使我党遭受损失使革命力量削弱，于实际毫无裨益，所以守常同志决不愿为他个人作无益的牺牲。这种坚贞为党而不为个人打算的品质与作风，实可为后人永世典范。
    1925—1926年间，在北方各省，如直隶、河南、内蒙古一带地区开展了农民运动。守常同志从这时候起，就注意深入地研究这个问题，曾亲自训练干部，并把他们派往各处参加农民运动。这些工作为后来北方农民运动的发展打下了基础。
    总之，我和守常同志一起工作的数年间，深深体会到守常同志不但为人谦虚和霭，生活朴素艰苦，而且非常忠实于马克思列宁主义和共产主义事业。在长时期中，他同一切反动势力，如袁世凯、辜鸿铭、林杼以至于胡适之流，不断地作无情的斗争，并组织北方一切进步力量，执行党的政策，使北方有了强有力的革命势力。这不能不说是守常同志对党的功绩。
    守常同志牺牲已经三十年了，而守常同志的事业，是永垂不朽的，他的那种坚贞为党不为个人打算的品质和优良作风，是值得我们学习的。
