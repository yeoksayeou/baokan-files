Representatives from publishing houses in twelve countries—Albania, Bulgaria, China, Democratic Germany, North Korea, Mongolia, Poland, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, the Soviet Union, and Vietnam—unanimously adopted a resolution on exchanging experiences, strengthening ties, and mutual assistance and cooperation on the 16th. The Yugoslav publisher representatives, who attended the meeting as observers, also expressed their support for this resolution.

The resolution stated: The holding of this conference demonstrates the close ties between socialist countries in important ideological and cultural work. This connection is based on the common interests of socialist countries—building socialist societies, defending the cause of peace, and promoting human progress. The conference showed that the publishing industries of socialist countries have basic common characteristics, namely: fighting for the victory of Marxism-Leninism and the victory of socialism. The principles of Marxism-Leninism are the guiding principles for the activities of these countries' publishing houses. The conference also showed that the organizational forms and methods of the publishing industry in each country have their own characteristics. These characteristics are determined by the specific forms of building socialism, historical and cultural traditions, and other conditions in each country.

The resolution pointed out: Countries can strengthen cooperation and ties and help each other improve their respective publishing undertakings through bilateral and multilateral agreements, according to needs and possibilities, and under the principles of complete equality, mutual benefit, and voluntariness. The conference determined the principles for close cooperation between the participating countries in these areas: establishing direct contact and ties between publishing houses with similar businesses, organizing joint publication of books, jointly studying the world book market, cooperation between the leading agencies of the publishing industry, and mutual assistance in improving the technical quality of books.
