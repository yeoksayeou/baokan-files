Five Deep Exploration Wells Start Drilling

    In the Ya'erxia exploration area of the Jiuquan Basin, another exploration well with a depth of over 3,000 meters began drilling on the afternoon of April 12th. This is the fifth deep exploration well to be drilled here since the beginning of this year.

    This new oil reservoir, discovered last year by petroleum geology exploration personnel from the Yumen Oil Mine and already proven to have industrial exploitation value, is located in front of the snow-capped Qilian Mountains. The winter is very cold, with temperatures dropping to minus thirty degrees Celsius at the coldest times, and it still often snows here. In order to accelerate the exploration of the oil-bearing area and oil reserves in this region, and to provide geological data for early exploitation, drilling workers have never stopped drilling, despite the frequent blizzards and bitter winds.

    五口深探井开钻
    酒泉盆地的鸭儿峡探区，又有一口三千公尺以上的探井在4月12日下午开钻，这是今年以来在这里开钻的第五口深探井。
    这个在去年经玉门油矿石油地质勘探人员发现的、并且已经证明具有工业开采价值的新油藏，位于白雪皑皑的祁连山前，冬季非常寒冷，最冷的时候在零下三十多度，现在这里仍然常常飘落雪花。为了加速探明这个地区的储油面积和储油量，给早日进行开采提供地质资料，尽管时常遇到大雪纷飞、寒风凛冽的天气，钻井工人从来也没有停止过钻探工作。
