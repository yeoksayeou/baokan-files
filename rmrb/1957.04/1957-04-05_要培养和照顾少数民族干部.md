    To Cultivate and Care for Minority Ethnic Cadres

    Editor:
    The Tianlin County National Trade Company in Guangxi Province serves the minority ethnic groups of this county, and it should, of course, educate and cultivate minority ethnic trade cadres. However, the reality is not like this. The education and cultivation of minority ethnic cadres here, and even the care for them in their lives, is unsatisfactory.
    The company has a total of 83 cadres, of which only 22 are Zhuang and Yao ethnic cadres, and the rest are Han. Only one of the four managers is Zhuang. Of the 13 cadres holding section chief positions, only two are Zhuang cadres, one of whom was only promoted to deputy section chief in the second half of last year. These minority ethnic cadres who have been promoted have also grown relatively slowly in their work.
    What is particularly intolerable is that some Han leading cadres in this company actually discriminate against minority ethnic cadres. In February of last year, a young Zhuang cadre was getting married. At that time, the leaders said: "All the dormitories have been used as warehouses, so those getting married should temporarily rent private houses outside!" The young Zhuang cadre had no choice but to rent a private house himself. Later, he had a child, and the house was too small. He saw that there were two empty rooms in the company dormitory and wrote a report requesting a solution. The next day, a Zhuang manager told him to move back to the company, but a Han manager said: "You can't move back. These two empty rooms should be reserved for receiving cadres who come and go." As a result, the Zhuang cadre still did not move back. However, three days later, these two rooms were assigned to two Han cadres, one who was getting married and the other who was moving back from a private house.
    Aren't these practices of some Han leading cadres of the Tianlin County National Trade Company caused by Great Han chauvinism? We hope that the relevant leaders of this company can examine the implementation of ethnic policies and earnestly improve their future work.

### 要培养和照顾少数民族干部

    要培养和照顾少数民族干部编辑同志：
    广西省田林县民族贸易公司是为这个县的少数民族服务的，它当然应该教育和培养少数民族贸易干部。但是事实却不是这样，这里对少数民族干部的教育、培养以至生活上的照顾，是不能令人满意的。
    全公司共有干部八十三人，其中仅有二十二个僮族和瑶族干部，其余都是汉族。四个经理只有一个是僮族，担任股长职务的干部有十三人，僮族干部仅占二人，其中有一人是去年下半年才提拔为副股长的。这些已经提拔起来的少数民族干部，在工作中成长也比较慢。
    尤其令人不能容忍的是：这个公司有些汉族领导干部竟然歧视少数民族干部。去年2月间，有一位僮族青年干部要结婚，当时，领导同志说：“目前所有宿舍都已拿来当仓库使用了，结婚的暂时到外面租用民房吧！”这个僮族青年干部无法，只好自己去租民房。后来，他添了一个小孩，房子住不下，他看到公司宿舍里有两间空房，写了一个报告，请求解决。第二天，一位僮族的经理叫他搬回公司来住，一位汉族的经理却说：“不能搬回来，这两间空房要留着招待来往干部。”结果这个僮族干部还是没有搬回来。但是，过了三天这两间房子却分给两个汉族干部住了，一个是结婚，另一个正是从民房里搬回来的。
    田林县民族贸易公司某些汉族领导干部的这些做法，难道不是大汉族主义思想在作怪？我们希望这个公司有关领导能够检查一下民族政策执行情况，切实改进今后的工作。
