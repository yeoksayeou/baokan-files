    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 28th—The first Soviet "satellite city," capable of accommodating 65,000 residents with complete facilities, will be built in the Khimki district near Moscow.
    The construction of "satellite cities" is a new development in Soviet urban construction. As we all know, the 20th Congress of the CPSU pointed out that the residents of many large cities must be dispersed. This means building small cities with good living conditions around the large cities, so that these small cities can absorb some of the people living in the city center. Some enterprises in large cities can also be moved to these small cities.
    In order to build this "satellite city" of Moscow, an area of 750 hectares with higher terrain and surrounded by forests has been selected. The residences in the new city will mostly be four-story buildings. The design of the residences strives to meet the living conditions of the suburbs: they are both economical and fully equipped. Running water, gas, heating, sewage, and electricity will be available.

    苏联第一座“卫星城”将在莫斯科附近诞生
    据新华社莫斯科28日电　苏联第一座能容纳六万五千居民的设备完善的“卫星城”将在莫斯科附近的希姆金区建立起来。
    “卫星城”的建设是苏联城市建设的一个新发展。大家知道，苏共第二十次代表大会曾经指出，许多大城市的居民必须加以疏散。这就是在大城市的周围建设一些居住条件良好的小城市，让这些小城市吸收市区中心的一部分人去居住。大城市中的一些企业也可以迁到这些小城市去。
    为了建筑这座莫斯科的“卫星城”，选定了一个地势较高、周围有森林的占地七百五十公顷的地区。新城市的住宅将多半是四层楼房。住宅的设计力求合乎近郊的生活条件：既经济，设备又齐全。自来水、煤气、暖气、下水道和电灯等设备将应有尽有。
