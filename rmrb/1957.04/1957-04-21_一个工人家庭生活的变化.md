    Changes in the Life of a Worker's Family
    By our reporter Ye Jianyun

    (Continued from yesterday)

    November 1955 to August 1956

    In the winter of 1955, Feng Guangzhi suffered from appendicitis and was hospitalized, spending 120 yuan. According to labor insurance regulations, 100 yuan was reimbursed, and he spent 20 yuan himself. At this time, he had another son. His wife, because she did not rest well when she gave birth to her first child, developed problems. After the third child was born, she had back pain and spent more than 20 yuan on acupuncture and medicine. In addition, her milk was insufficient, so she drank half a pound of milk every day for two months, costing 4.2 yuan for the milk and 1.15 yuan for one and a half jin of white sugar, increasing the monthly expenditure by 5.35 yuan. After two months, the milk stopped, and feeding milk powder and eggs, plus biscuits and bread, cost 4 yuan per month. In less than three months, another 20 yuan was spent on medical bills, totaling more than 40 yuan.

    When Feng Guangzhi returned from the hospital, he was promoted to a fifth-grade worker, and his monthly salary increased from 45 yuan to 54 yuan. Both husband and wife were recovering from illness and childbirth, so their living standards could not be reduced. Coupled with the expenses for the third child, although their wages increased, their living standards did not improve much.

    The expenditure during this period was as follows:

    Staple food: 50 jin of macaroni 9.42 yuan
           60 jin of rice 8.4 yuan
           20 jin of corn flour 2 yuan
    Non-staple food: Vegetables 9 yuan
            Oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, tea, total 3 yuan
            Meat (including beef and mutton) 2 yuan
    Fuel: 500 jin of briquettes 4.5 yuan
          80 jin of firewood 1.6 yuan
          Rent and utilities: 3 yuan
    Sundries: 3 yuan
    Needlework: Adding clothes, shoes, and socks for children (monthly average) 2.5 yuan
    Expenses for the third child 4 yuan
    Monthly medical expenses 1.2 yuan

    Total monthly expenditure: 53.62 yuan

    During this period, more than 82% of the family's staple food was converted to refined grains. Meat was also fixed at four to five times a month, and guests could be served a pot of third-grade flower tea. The children's ragged clothes were also replaced with new ones. The 40 yuan debt was fully repaid by the trade union in the first quarter of 1956.

    August 1956 to February 1957

    After the wage reform, Feng Guangzhi's salary increased from the original 54 yuan to 65.5 yuan. The specific expenses for the family of six are as follows:

    In August, 46 yuan in back pay was issued. The couple each bought a pair of shoes, and the children also bought a pair. The mother added a set of unlined clothes and a woolen sweater, bought a bed sheet and a double bed, and the back pay was spent.

    In October, the workshop won a collective award, and Feng Guangzhi received 12 yuan. He added two yuan and bought a crystal radio.

    Just as they were planning their lives according to their new income, the eldest child broke his leg while playing on the parallel bars in the yard. Western medicine with plaster and X-rays did not cure it, so he was transferred to traditional Chinese medicine for treatment, spending 95 yuan including transportation. 50 yuan was reimbursed, leaving a debt of 45 yuan.

    The current monthly living expenses are as follows:

    Staple food: 54 jin of macaroni 10.18 yuan
           70 jin of rice 9.8 yuan
           10 jin of corn flour 1 yuan
    Non-staple food: Vegetables, etc. 10 yuan
            Meat 2.5 yuan
            4.4 liang of oil 2.3 yuan
            4 jin of soy sauce 0.6 yuan
            Salt and other seasonings 1 yuan
            1 liang of tea 0.32 yuan
    Fuel: 400 jin of coal (home has heating, saving coal) 3.2 yuan
          50 jin of firewood 1.5 yuan
    Utilities and rent: 2.3 yuan
    Medical expenses: 2 yuan
    Shoe fabric, adding clothes, average monthly 3 yuan
    Union dues: 0.7 yuan
    Sundries: (including needlework, entertainment, transportation) 7 yuan

    Total expenditure: 57.4 yuan

    In addition to the above expenses, an average of more than 7 yuan can be saved each month. Due to the child's broken leg, a debt of 45 yuan was incurred, which will be repaid at 7 yuan per month starting in January, and is expected to be cleared by June.

    From the changes in Feng Guangzhi's family life, it can be seen that his family income has been increasing in recent years. The family's population is also growing. Due to the increase in population, although living standards have improved, the improvement is not so rapid. The increase in Feng Guangzhi's family income and population is as follows:
Time   Population Income  Percentage increase in average wage per capita Percentage increase in population
Before Liberation 4  Not calculated Not calculated Not calculated Not calculated
Early Liberation 4  16 yuan  Not calculated Not calculated Not calculated
1951.3-1951.11 4  30.8 yuan 7.7 yuan  100%  100%
1951.12-1955.11 5  45 yuan  9 yuan  46%  17%
1955.12-1956.8 6  54 yuan  9 yuan  75%  17%
1956.9-1957.2 6  65.5 yuan 10.9 yuan  112%  41%

    It can be seen that in six years, Feng Guangzhi's wage income has more than doubled. With the addition of two children, the average living expenses per person have only increased by 41%. If the factor of population growth is removed, the family's living expenses would be more than 16 yuan per person. That is to say, if there were no two additional children, the living expenses per person would have more than doubled as well.

    Even with the increase in children, Feng Guangzhi's family life has still improved. This improvement is primarily reflected in the changes in staple and non-staple foods.

        Time Crude grains Refined grains Percentage increase or decrease
        1951 100 15 100%
        1952 50 80 50% decrease in crude grains, 433% increase in refined grains
        1956 20 110 80% decrease in crude grains, 633% increase in refined grains
        1957 10 124 90% decrease in crude grains, 727% increase in refined grains

    Staple food is the main part of family life. From this statistic, it can be seen that the improvement in the main part of workers' lives is very significant. However, the increase in vegetables and meat is not so significant.

            Time Vegetables Edible oil Meat
            1951 2.4 yuan 1 jin 0.5 jin
            1952 9 yuan 3.5 jin 2 jin
            1956 9 yuan 3.5 jin 3 jin
            1957 10 yuan 4.25 jin 3.5 jin

    Since Liberation, due to the rapid increase in the urban population, the prices of some agricultural products have slightly increased. For example, in 1951, eight cents a day could buy three jin of cabbage and two pieces of tofu; while in 1954, the same amount of vegetables would cost twelve cents. Now (referring to winter), the same amount of vegetables would cost 24.5 cents. Feng Guangzhi's family can only afford four jin of cabbage and two pieces of tofu for 33 cents a day.

    Second, in terms of sundries, housing, and clothing, Feng Guangzhi's family life has also improved. Monthly sundries have increased from 3 yuan to 7 yuan. However, due to the addition of two people, the average monthly sundries per person used to be 77 cents, and now it is 1.17 yuan per person. In recent years, the prices of daily necessities and service industries have also increased. For example, a bar of soap that used to cost 17 cents now costs 19 cents. A pair of cloth shoes that used to cost 40 cents now costs 45 to 50 cents. All living materials for urban workers are commodities, and everything must be bought with money. The prices of many commodities have slightly increased after adjustments. In this view, the increase in sundries is actually not much.

    Housing problem. Feng Guangzhi's family originally lived in a dilapidated temple. Later, they moved to the factory and lived in a twelve-square-meter room for six people, which was of course relatively crowded. Now, they have been allocated two rooms of 28 square meters. The change looks big. However, we must also see that in the past few years, due to the tight housing situation in the city, many workers' families of five or six people, young and old, were all squeezed into one room. Feng Guangzhi's family was in this situation. This was just a temporary way to overcome difficulties under difficult conditions. Now that the situation has improved, this can only be said to be a more normal situation, and does not mean that workers' lives have improved unexpectedly.

    Clothing issue. Within three years, Feng Guangzhi's family has rarely added clothes except for a few clothes for the children, a set of unlined clothes for the mother, a set of cotton clothes, and a cotton jacket and a few sets of unlined clothes for the wife. In order to add a quilt, they had to prepare several months in advance, accumulating little by little each month. Only at the end of the year could they afford a quilt. Feng Guangzhi himself has not had a set of cotton clothes for many years, especially when working the night shift in winter, he could not bear the cold. Later, the trade union subsidized him 20 yuan, and he was able to buy a set of cotton clothes.

    Third, in terms of household miscellaneous items. The furniture and kitchen utensils that Feng Guangzhi has added in recent years are as follows:

    1. One old single bed and one old double bed
    2. One cupboard (old)
    3. One small dining table
    4. One wardrobe
    5. One old coffee table
    6. Two square stools
    7. Four small benches (nailed together with wooden boards from soap boxes)
    8. One twin-bell alarm clock
    9. One crystal radio
    10. One enamel washbasin and one enamel soap dish each
    11. Two old leather suitcases

    Kitchen utensils:

    1. One No. 1 two-layer steamer aluminum pot
    2. One No. 2 stewing aluminum pot
    3. One iron and one aluminum pot for stir-frying
    4. Four large bowls, eight small bowls, one porcelain vegetable basin, one aluminum vegetable basin
    5. One tea set teapot, four teacups, two enamel cups
    6. Two bamboo-shell water bottles
    7. One No. 2 stove
    8. One spoon, one spatula, one kitchen knife each
    9. One cutting board, one chopping board each, one laundry basin

    These things were all gradually purchased with money saved from daily living expenses after 1953. Many of the furniture was bought in second-hand stores. The furniture has gradually increased over the years. When moving from the suburbs of Landianchang to the city in 1953, a tricycle was not full. This time, when moving from the old factory to the new factory, a rubber-wheeled cart was pulled.

    These items can only be considered as essential items for a typical household. Of course, it is much better than the situation in 1951 when they lived in a dilapidated temple and had only a stove with three legs and a few bowls, and all other items such as kitchen knives were borrowed from others. The improvement in this area is not too good or excessive.

    In general, Feng Guangzhi's family life has greatly improved in recent years. This improvement is in line with the current living standards of the Chinese people. The above materials also show that the family life of a worker's family with a moderate standard of living has greatly improved and raised; however, the current worker's life cannot be considered too good, nor can it be considered to have improved too quickly.

                                                  (End)

    一个工人家庭生活的变化
    本报记者　叶剑韵
    （续昨）
    1955年11月到1956年8月
    1955年的冬季，冯广智害了阑尾炎，住医院，花了一百二十元。根据劳动保险条例的规定报销了一百元，自己花了二十元。这时，他又添了一个男孩子。他妻子由于在生第一个孩子的时候，没有休息好，得了毛病，第三个孩子一生下来，就腰酸背痛的，扎针吃药拉了二十多元的账。又加上奶不足，吃了两个月的牛奶，每日半磅，奶钱四元二角，还有一斤半白糖，一元一角五分，每月增加了五元三角五分的开支。两个月以后奶停了，吃奶粉鸡子，加上饼干面包等，每个月也得四元。三个月不到，又拉了二十多元的账。合计拉了四十多元的账。
    冯广智出院回来，升了五级工，每月工资由四十五元增加到五十四元。夫妇两人，一个是病后，一个是产后，生活又不能降低，加上第三个孩子的费用，工资增加了，生活并没有多大的改善。
    这个时期支出的情况是这样的：
    主食：通粉五十斤　九元四角二分
          大米六十斤　八元四角
          棒子面二十斤　二元
    副食：蔬菜　九元
          油、盐、酱油、醋、茶叶合计　三元
          肉食（包括牛羊肉）二元
    燃料：煤球五百斤　四元五角
          劈柴八十斤　一元六角
          房租 水电：三元
    零用：三元
    针线：小孩添衣服、鞋袜（每个月平均）二元五角
    第三个小孩的费用　四元
    每月医药费　一元二角
    合计全月支出是五十三元六角二分。
    这个时期，全家的生活情况主食已有82％以上改为细粮。肉食也固定为每月四次到五次，来客人，也可以沏一壶三级花茶。孩子们披破挂片的衣服，也能换上新衣服了。拉了四十多元的账，1956年第一季度，工会全部代还了。
    1956年8月到1957年2月
    工资改革以后，冯广智所拿到的工资由原来的五十四元增加到六十五元五角。全家六口人，具体的开支情况是这样的：
    8月补发了四十六元的工资，夫妇各买了一双鞋，孩子也买了一双，母亲添了一身单衣，又买了一件绒衣，买了一床单子，又买了一张双人床，补发的钱花光了。
    10月间，车间里得了个集体奖，冯广智分得十二元，又添了两元，买了一个矿石收音机。
    正在按新的收入安排生活的时候，大孩子在院子里玩双杠，不小心将腿摔断了，西医上石膏拍照片没治好，又转中医治，先后连车钱花了九十五元，报销了五十元，还拉了四十五元的账。
    现在每月的生活开支是这样的：
    主食：通粉五十四斤　十元一角八分
          大米七十斤　九元八角  
          棒子面十斤　一元
    副食：蔬菜等　十元
          肉食　二元五角
          油四斤四两　二元三角
          酱油四斤　六角
          盐及其他调料　一元
          茶叶一两　三角二分
    燃料：煤四百斤（家有暖气节省了煤）三元二角
          劈柴五十斤一元五角
    水电房租：二元三角
    医药费：二元
    鞋面布、添衣服平均每月三元
    工会费：七角
    零用：（包括针线、文娱、交通费）七元
    合计支出五十七元四角
    除了上述开支外，平均每个月可以节余七元以上。由于孩子摔断了腿，拉下的四十五元账，从1月份起每月还七元，预计六月份即差不多可以还清。
    从冯广智家庭生活的变化可以看出，几年来他的家庭收入是在增加的。家庭的人口也在增长。由于人口的增多，生活虽有改善，但改善的还不是那么快。冯广智家庭收入增加和人口增长的情况如下：时期　人口　收入　按人口平均工资增加的百分比按人口增加的百分比解放以前　4　未计　未　计　未　计　未　计解放初期　4　16元　4　未　计　未　计1951、3—同年11月4　30.8元　7.7元　100％　100％1951、12—1955、115　45元　9　46％　17％1955、12—1956、86　54元　9　75％　17％1956、9—1957、26　65.5元　10.9　112％　41％
    由此可见，六年的时间，冯广智的工资收入增加了一倍有余。增加了两个孩子，按人口平均，每人的生活费用只增加了41％。如果除去人口增长的因素，他家的生活费用每人将在十六元以上。这就是说，如果不是增加了两个孩子的话，每人的生活费用，同样是增长一倍有余。
    即是在孩子增加的情况下，冯广智的家庭生活，仍然是有改善的。这种生活状况的改善，第一表现在主副食品的变化方面。
        时　期　粗　粮　细　粮　增或减的百分比
        1951　100　15　100％
        1952　50　80　减少粗粮50％  增加细粮433％
        1956　20　110　减少粗粮80％  增加细粮633％
        1957　10　124　减少粗粮90％  增加细粮727％
    主食是家庭生活中的主要部分，从这个统计数字中可以看出，工人生活的主要部分改善情况是十分显著的。但是蔬菜和肉食增加的情况就不是那么显著了。
            时期　蔬菜　食油　肉食
            1951　2.4元　1斤　0.5斤
            1952　9元　3.5斤　2斤
            1956　9元　3.5斤　3斤
            1957　10元　4.25斤　3.5斤
    解放以后，由于城市人口的迅速增加，某些农产品的价格是略有提高的。如在1951年时期，每天八分钱，可以买到三斤白菜，两方豆腐；而到1954年买同样的菜就需要一角二分。现在（指冬季）买同样的菜就需要两角四分五厘。冯广智家每天三角三分钱，也只能吃到四斤白菜，两方豆腐。
    第二、就零用、住房子、穿衣方面来看，冯广智的家庭生活也是有提高的。每个月的零用由三元提高到七元。但是，由于增加了两口人，过去每人每月平均零用是七角七分，现在每人每月是一元一角七分。近几年来，日用百货及服务行业的售价和收费也有了提高。如一角七分一块的肥皂，现在要卖一角九分。过去上一双布鞋四角，现在就得四角五分到五角。城市工人的生活资料全部是商品，什么都得花钱买，不少商品的价格经过调整后稍有提高。这样看来，零用费实际上是增加的不多的。
    住房子问题。冯广智家原先是住在一座破庙里。后来搬到厂里来住，六口人住十二平方公尺的一间房子，当然是比较挤的，现在拨给他家二十八平方公尺的两间房子。看上去变化很大。但是我们也必须看到，前几年，由于城市房屋紧张，不少的工人一家五、六口，老小全挤在一间屋子里，冯广智的家庭就是这样的情况。这不过是在困难的条件下采取的一种暂时克服困难的办法。现在情况改善了，这只能说明是一种比较正常的状况，并不能说明工人的生活有了出人意外的提高。
    穿衣服的问题。三年之内，冯广智一家除了孩子们添了几件衣服、母亲添了一身单衣，一身棉衣，妻子做了一件棉上衣和几身单衣以外，全家则很少添衣服。为了添一床被，几个月前就得准备，一个月一个月点点滴滴的积蓄，到年底，才能置一条被。冯广智本人多年来没有一套棉衣，尤其是冬天上夜班，冻的受不了，后来还是工会救济了他二十元，才买了一套棉衣。
    第三、就家用杂物这方面的情况来看。几年来冯广智添置的家具及厨房用物如下：
    一、旧单人双人床各一张
    二、碗橱一只（旧的）
    三、小饭桌一张
    四、衣柜一只
    五、旧茶几一只
    六、方凳子两只
    七、小板凳四只（用肥皂箱子上的木板钉起来的）
    八、双铃闹钟一只
    九、矿石收音机一只
    十、搪瓷面盆、搪瓷肥皂盒各一只
    十一、旧皮箱两只。
    厨房用物方面：
    一、头号两屉蒸笼铝锅一只
    二、二号闷饭铝锅一只
    三、炒菜用的铁、铝锅各一只
    四、大碗四只、小碗八只、瓷菜盆铝菜盆各一只
    五、茶具茶壶一把，茶杯四只，搪瓷杯两只
    六、竹壳水瓶两只
    七、二号火炉一只
    八、勺子、铲子、菜刀各一把
    九、切面板、切菜板各一只、洗衣盆一只。
    这些东西全是1953年以后用日常生活开支节省下来的钱逐渐购买的。其中许多家具，是在旧货店里买来的。几年来家具是渐渐多了起来；1953年从郊区蓝靛厂往城里搬家的时候，一辆三轮车没装满，这次由老厂往新厂搬，就拉了一胶皮轱轳车。
    这些物件，也只能算一个通常住家户必备的用物。当然比起1951年住在破庙里除了一只只有三条腿的火炉和几只碗，其他菜刀等物件全向人家借用的情况来是好多了，在这方面情况的改善，并没有什么太好太过分的。
    总的说来，冯广智的家庭生活几年来是有很大的改善的。这种改善的状况和我国人民当前的生活水平是相适应的。上述材料也可以看出：一个中等生活水平的工人家庭，几年来家庭生活有了很大的改善和提高；但是，目前的工人生活并不能算太好，也不能算提高的太快。
                                                  （完）
