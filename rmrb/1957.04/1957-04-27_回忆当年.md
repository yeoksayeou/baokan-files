    "Recalling the Old Days"
    Fang Da
    Spring is the time when people put on new clothes, but spring in Paris has put on period costumes to welcome a distinguished guest of France—Queen Elizabeth II of England.
    On the evening of April 9th, the Seine River was ablaze with colorful lights. Flags from the eras of Louis XIV and Louis XV fluttered along the riverbank in the spring breeze. Guards wore costumes from the Napoleonic era and the era of Louis XV. One hundred and fifty choirboys in white robes sang a fifteenth-century hymn, and loudspeakers carried the song to the yacht on the Seine, carrying the French President and the British Queen. …
    On the evening following this grand event, called "Recalling the Old Days," the French President held an unprecedented state banquet for the distinguished guests. The historically significant Louvre Museum was redecorated that evening as a former royal palace, and the orchestra played eighteenth-century light music.
    Both the yacht party on the Seine and the state banquet in the Louvre took place in an atmosphere that could not be described as anything but intimate and joyful. However, within this "Recalling the Old Days" spectacle, there was indeed a touch of sadness. It was like a faded rose that one might find in an old book on a bookshelf. Its faint fragrance and dim petals can only evoke a sense of loss; what else could they do? Paris today, dressed in the costumes of the Napoleonic era, only proves the fact that the once-powerful French Empire and the British Empire can now only seek their prestige in "Recalling the Old Days."
    Admittedly, France is using this "Recalling the Old Days" spectacle to welcome the British guests in order to encourage the future, hoping that Britain and France will strengthen their alliance, so that the days of the Napoleonic era and the Victorian era can be seen again in the twentieth century, and hoping that their colonial empires can expand their territories. France's invitation was issued on September 27th of last year, that is, when Britain and France were plotting to attack Egypt, which can very well illustrate what they are thinking. However, whether the union of Britain and France can compete with their "ally," the United States, is still a question, and the struggle of the colonial people for independence and freedom can no longer be suppressed.
    Coincidentally, while President Coty and Queen Elizabeth were enjoying this rare beautiful scene on the Seine, Sir Anthony Eden was "sleeping restlessly" in a hospital room in Boston, USA. Eden has been ill since the failure of the armed invasion of Egypt, and this illness has persisted to this day. The political climate in Britain was obviously too unsuitable for his illness, so he came to the United States and entered Boston Hospital. This man, who refused to merely wallow in "Recalling the Old Days" but wanted to struggle to return to the past, dedicated his whole life to restoring the "glory" of the British colonial empire, but now, like the British Empire, he is approaching his twilight years, lonely and desolate. A reporter from the British "Daily Mail" said that he was so poor that he could not even afford medical expenses and loudly appealed, "The government should pay Sir Anthony Eden's medical expenses."
    Of course, Sir Anthony Eden is not really so poor that he cannot afford to pay for medical treatment, and even if he really could not pay, the British government would not fail to pay for him. The problem is that if the costumed carnival night on the Seine means that Britain and France are united to deal with anti-colonial forces, then the British government's future expenditure on such medical expenses may be so large as to be incalculable.

    “回忆当年”
    方达
    春天是人们换上新装的日子，可是春天的巴黎却换上了古装，为的是欢迎法国的贵宾——英国的女王伊丽莎白二世。
    4月9日晚上，塞纳河上一片五彩缤纷的灯光。路易十四和路易十五时代的旗帜，迎着春风在河畔飘扬。卫兵们穿着拿破仑时代的服装和路易十五时代的服装。一百五十个穿着白袍的歌童唱着一首十五世纪的赞美诗，扩音机把歌声送到塞纳河上法国总统和英国女王乘坐的游艇上。……
    在这次被称为“回忆当年”的盛会结束后的第二天晚上，法国总统为贵宾们举行了空前隆重的国宴。历史悠久的罗浮宫博物馆那天晚上重新装饰成了昔日的皇宫，乐队奏着十八世纪的轻音乐。
    塞纳河上的游艇晚会和罗浮宫内的国宴，都在不能不说是亲密、欢欣的气氛中进行的。然而，这种“回忆当年”的排场里面，却着实有一股凄凉的味道。就像人们从书架上的旧书里翻出来的一朵残谢了的玫瑰。它的若有若无的一缕清香和黯淡了的花瓣，除了勾起伤逝的感叹之外，还能有什么呢？穿上拿破仑时代的服装的今日巴黎，只不过证明了这样一个事实：不可一世的法兰西帝国和不列颠帝国的声威，如今只能从“回忆当年”中去寻找了。
    诚然，法国用这种“回忆当年”的排场来欢迎英国的贵宾，是为了策勉未来，希望英、法两国加强联盟，使拿破仑时代和维多利亚女王时代的日子能够重见于二十世纪，希望他们的殖民帝国能够日拓版图。法国的邀请是在去年9月27日，也就是英、法策划进攻埃及的时候发出的，很可以说明它们的想法是什么。可是，英、法的联合是否就能与它们的“盟友”——美国争雄，还是一个问题，而殖民地人民争取独立自由的斗争，是再也镇压不住的了。
    事有凑巧。正当戈蒂总统和伊丽莎白女王在塞纳河上欣赏这不可多得的良辰美景的时候，安东尼·艾登爵士却在美国波士顿医院的病房里“睡得很不安稳”。艾登从武装侵略埃及失败以后就病了，这病一直到现在都没有好。英国的政治气候对他的病显然太不合适，因此他来到了美国，进了波士顿医院。这个不肯仅仅沉溺于“回忆当年”而想挣扎着回复到当年的人，为恢复英国殖民帝国的“光荣”鞠躬尽瘁了一辈子，现在却像不列颠帝国一样日暮途穷，老境凄凉。英国“每日邮报”的记者说他穷得连医药费也付不起，并且大声疾呼：“政府应当代艾登爵士付这笔医药费”。
    当然，艾登爵士不至于真的穷到这步田地，就算他的确付不出医药费，英国政府也不会不给他代付。问题是，如果塞纳河上的古装的狂欢之夜是意味着英、法两国联合起来对付反殖民主义的力量的话，那末，英国政府将来在这种医药费方面的开支也许会多到不可胜计。
