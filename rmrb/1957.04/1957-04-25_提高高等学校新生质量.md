    Improving the Quality of New University Students

    Based on the needs of national construction and the possible conditions of universities, the Ministry of Higher Education has initially drafted a plan to enroll a total of 107,000 students in universities in 1957.

    Some people believe that the planned target of only 107,000 students this year is a "retreat" or "too conservative." In fact, this is not the case. The key to determining the number of university enrollments this year lies in two factors: one is the actual needs of national construction, and the other is the possible conditions of the universities themselves. From the perspective of national construction needs, the number of students currently enrolled in Chinese universities, plus this year's enrollment, is basically sufficient to meet the requirements of the Second Five-Year Plan for industrial and agricultural production and scientific research. From the perspective of the universities' possible conditions, due to the rapid development in the past few years, the number of students enrolled increased by 254.6% from the 1949-1950 academic year to the 1956-1957 academic year, with an average annual growth rate of 19.4%. In order to consolidate the achievements of the rapid quantitative development in the past few years and solve the problems left over from the large-scale development in 1956, it is necessary to slow down the pace of development in 1957. Even if the pace of development is slowed down, the number of students enrolled will still increase by more than 12%. From this, it can be seen that whether from the needs of national construction or the possible conditions of the universities, the plan to enroll 107,000 students in 1957 is basically appropriate, and it is neither a "retreat" nor "conservative." The problem today lies in taking some necessary measures to vigorously improve the quality of new students.

    From the perspective of the needs of national construction, in the past few years, China was in a period of rapid recovery and development of the national economy, and various national construction undertakings urgently needed universities to train a large number of scientific and technological talents and management cadres. In order to meet the urgent needs at that time, universities, in addition to offering four- and five-year undergraduate programs, also established a large number of specialized courses. Moreover, in the situation where there were very few high school graduates and it was necessary to expand the source of students from other aspects, it was sometimes necessary to lower the quality requirements for new students. In the future, as key projects are successively completed and put into production, and China's scientific research endeavors to approach the world's advanced level as much as possible in a not-too-long period of time, universities should pay more attention to improving the quality of cadre training. At the same time, from the perspective of the development of the universities themselves, due to the rapid development in the past few years, the current number of students enrolled in universities and this year's enrollment can basically meet the needs of national construction in the Second Five-Year Plan. The main issue at present and in the future is to further improve quality. And improving the quality of new students is one of the important conditions for improving teaching quality. To improve the quality of new university students, the first thing to do is to have a large number of high school graduates to choose from.

    We know that in many countries around the world, only one out of every three or more high school graduates can be admitted to university. In the past few years, due to the fact that the development of high schools in China lagged behind the needs of university enrollment, there was very little room for selection when recruiting new students, and it was relatively difficult to improve the quality of new students. It was not until this year that it began to transition to a more normal situation where high school graduates can basically meet the enrollment needs of universities. This year, universities will recruit an average of one student from every 1.8 high school graduates, which is obviously still a very broad admission, but it does provide more favorable conditions for improving the quality of new students than in the past. From the perspective of the teaching effectiveness of universities, in the past, due to the low quality of the new students recruited, on the one hand, students with too poor levels could not keep up with the class and dropped out, which was detrimental to both the state and the individual students; on the other hand, some students who could barely keep up with the class often felt very strenuous due to their inadequate original foundation, which is one of the reasons for the excessive learning burden and poor academic performance of students. If new students with better quality can be recruited, the phenomenon of dropping out and excessive learning burden can be reduced or avoided, and better quality talents can be trained, who will play a greater role in national construction.

    This year's university enrollment methods have also been improved compared to the past. Based on the experience of enrollment work in the past few years and the specific circumstances of this year, unified enrollment facilitates candidates across the country to apply for various schools, conduct regional allocation in a planned way, ensure that various schools complete their enrollment plans, and the enrollment work burden is not too heavy, saving manpower and material resources, in line with the principle of streamlining and economy, and is also convenient for candidates. However, unified enrollment also has its shortcomings: students' wishes are sometimes not taken into account enough; schools lack initiative and enthusiasm; and regional allocation is inevitably flawed. This year, we have learned from the experience and lessons of unified enrollment in the past few years. On the one hand, we will still adopt the method of unified enrollment, but at the same time, we will also allow some schools to enroll students independently or jointly. In terms of regional allocation, since most regions' high school graduates can meet the enrollment needs of universities in their own provinces and cities, therefore, schools that train cadres for their own provinces and cities (such as normal, medical, and agricultural and forestry schools) will, in principle, adopt the method of enrolling, training, and assigning jobs locally; schools that train cadres for the whole country (such as engineering and comprehensive universities) should, in principle, first enroll students within the past major regions, and then enroll students from other regions when they are insufficient, among which Beijing, Tianjin, and some schools in the Northwest can recruit some students from East China and Central South China. This will minimize the number of people transferred between regions, which can not only make students accustomed to local life, but also save manpower and material resources for the country. In order to take care of the candidates' admission wishes, this year, the methods of filling in admission applications and conducting admission allocation will also try to meet the requirements of new students as much as possible, so as to more easily stimulate students' enthusiasm in learning and reduce the difficulty of professional ideological education.

    This year's enrollment work still requires the Party committees of various provinces and cities to strengthen leadership. We must overcome the relaxed thinking that "this year's enrollment task is small, there are many high school graduates, and the problem is not big." Although this year's enrollment task is smaller than last year, the requirements for the quality of new students are higher. This year, university enrollment requires strict selection and admission of new students with better quality in terms of politics, health, and academic performance. At the same time, although there are more high school graduates and there is more room for selection of new students, the tasks of various ideological education before and after the exam, especially the education of choosing majors based on personal strengths in a realistic manner, should be done more thoroughly and meticulously. This year's enrollment methods will also be improved compared to previous years, so this also requires relevant departments to do more ideological work and organizational work. The government, schools, the Communist Youth League and other relevant parties should quickly establish a relatively lean enrollment organization, and select cadres with more experience and higher quality in enrollment work to participate in this year's enrollment work. Now there are less than three months left before the summer vacation enrollment examination, and various tasks should be prepared as early and actively as possible.

    This year, about 80,000 to 90,000 high school graduates will not be able to go to college. In order to make arrangements for their participation in agricultural, handicraft, and industrial production labor, as well as self-study, it is necessary to use great efforts to carry out a series of ideological and organizational work. Graduates of secondary vocational schools generally will no longer be mobilized to apply for universities, and should first work for a few years and then go to university after gaining experience. All localities should also conduct appropriate publicity and education work in this regard.

### 提高高等学校新生质量

    提高高等学校新生质量
    根据国家建设的需要和高等学校的可能条件，目前高等教育部已初步拟定1957年度高等学校共计招生十万七千人的指标。
    有人认为今年只招生十万七千人的计划指标是“冒退”，或者说“太保守”了。其实不然，决定今年高等学校招生人数的关键有两个：一是国家建设的实际需要，一是高等学校本身的可能条件。从国家建设需要情况来看，我国高等学校在校学生数加上今年招生人数，已经基本上能够满足第二个五年计划工农业生产和科学研究的要求。从学校可能条件来说，由于过去几年发展速度较快，自1949—1950学年到1956—1957学年，在校学生共计增长254.6％，平均每年增长速度为19.4％。为了巩固过去几年来数量发展很快的成果，和解决1956年大发展所遗留下来的问题，1957年度放慢发展速度是必要的。即使放慢发展速度，在校学生数仍将增长12％强。由此可知，无论从国家建设的需要和学校可能条件来看，1957年度招生十万七千人的计划基本上还是妥当的，并不是“冒退”和“保守”。今天的问题就在于采取一些必要的措施，来大力提高新生的质量。
    从国家建设的需要方面来看，过去几年我国正处在国民经济迅速恢复和发展的时期，国家各项建设事业迫切需要高等学校培养大批的科学技术人才和管理干部。为了适应当时的迫切需要，高等学校除了办四、五年制的本科以外，还开办了大量的专修科，而且在高中毕业生很少、需要从其他方面扩大学生来源的情况下，有时不得不降低对新生的质量要求。今后随着重点工程陆续建成投入生产，我国科学研究事业争取尽可能在不太长的时间内接近世界先进水平，这就要求高等学校今后应该更多地注意提高培养干部的质量。同时，从高等学校本身发展的情况来看，由于过去几年来的迅速发展，目前高等学校的在校学生数和今年招生人数，已经基本上能够满足第二个五年计划国家建设的需要。当前和今后主要的问题是进一步提高质量。而提高新生质量则是提高教学质量的重要条件之一。要提高高等学校新生质量，首先就要有数量较多的高中毕业生来加以选择。
    我们知道，世界上不少国家都是三个以上高中毕业生才有一个人能考上大学。以往几年，由于我国高中的发展落后于高等学校招生的需要，录取新生选择余地很少，提高新生的质量是比较困难的事。直到今年，才开始转入高中毕业生基本上能够满足高等学校招生需要的这种比较正常的情况。今年的高等学校平均从一点八个高中毕业生中招收一个学生，这显然还是录取得很宽，但是对于提高新生质量来说，究竟是有了比过去有利的条件。从高等学校的教学效果上来看，过去由于招收的新生质量不高，一方面造成程度过差的学生跟不上班而中途退学，对国家对学生个人都很不利；另一方面，有些勉强能跟班学习的学生，往往也由于原来的基础不够，而感到很吃力，这是造成学生学习负担过重而学习成绩不够好的原因之一。假如能够招收质量较好的新生，既可以减少或避免中途退学和学习负担过重的现象，又能够培养质量较好的人才，他们对国家建设将会起更大的作用。
    今年高等学校招生的办法也比过去有所改进。根据以往几年来招生工作的经验和今年的具体情况，统一招生便于全国考生投考各类学校，有计划地进行地区调配，保证各类学校完成招生计划，而招生工作负担不致过重，节省人力物力，符合精简节约原则，对于考生也有一定的便利。但是，统一招生也有缺点：学生志愿有时照顾不够；学校缺乏主动性和积极性；地区调配也难免有缺点。今年接受了以往几年统一招生的经验教训，一方面仍要采取统一招生的办法，同时也允许部分学校单独或联合招生。在地区调配上，由于大部分地区高中毕业生都能满足本省市高等学校的招生需要，因此，凡是为本省市培养干部的学校（如师范、医药、农林等），原则上采取就地招生、就地培养、将来就地分配工作的办法；凡是为全国培养干部性质的学校（如工科、综合大学等），原则上应先在过去大区范围内招生，不足时再到外区招生，其中北京、天津和西北部分学校，可到华东、中南地区招收部分学生。这样就可以尽可能地减少地区之间的调配人数，既能使学生习惯于当地的生活，又能替国家节省人力物力。为着照顾考生的入学志愿，今年在填写入学志愿和进行录取分配的办法上，也得尽可能地满足新生的要求，以便更容易激发学生在学习上的积极性，减少专业思想教育的困难。
    今年的招生工作仍然需要各省市党委加强领导。要克服“今年招生任务少，高中毕业生多，问题不大”的松劲思想。今年招生任务虽然比去年少，但对新生质量的要求却要高些。今年高等学校招生要求严格做到从政治、健康、学业三方面来选择录取质量比较好的新生入学。同时，高中毕业生多，虽然新生选择余地多些，但考前考后各种思想教育的任务，特别是实事求是地按个人所长选择专业的教育，应该作得更深入细致一些。今年招生的办法也要比往年有所改进，因此，也就要求各有关部门做更多的思想工作和组织工作。政府、学校、青年团等有关方面，要迅速建立比较精干的招生机构，挑选对招生工作经验较多质量较高的干部来参加今年的招生工作。现在离开暑假招生考试只有不到三个月的时间了，各项工作应及早积极准备。
    今年约有八、九万高中毕业生升不了学。为了作好他们参加农业、手工业和工业的生产劳动以及自学等方面的安排，需要用很大的力量来进行一系列的思想组织工作。中等专业学校毕业生一般地不再动员报考大学，应先工作几年有了经验以后再升学。各地在这一方面也要进行适当的宣传教育工作。
