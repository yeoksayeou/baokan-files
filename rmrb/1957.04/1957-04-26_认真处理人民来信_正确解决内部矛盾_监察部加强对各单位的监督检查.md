Xinhua News Agency, April 24th: All levels of supervisory organs regard handling people's letters and visits as one of the important methods for correctly handling contradictions among the people. They have recently strengthened the supervision and inspection of this work in state organs and enterprises.

The Ministry of Supervision and the General Office of the State Council recently focused on inspecting the handling of people's letters and visits by the Ministry of Higher Education and the Ministry of Labor. Many provincial and municipal supervisory organs have also conducted inspections and reported the inspection results to the Ministry of Supervision.

It can be seen from the inspection that some organs attach importance to handling people's letters and visits. Ma Wenrui, Minister of Labor, often personally understands the handling of people's letters and visits and urges various departments to conscientiously study and handle the opinions and problems raised in the people's letters and visits. According to recent statistics from four units under the Ministry of Higher Education, 90% of the people's letters received in a year have been processed. Some of the remaining letters have been explained, and some are being studied and processed. When Shandong Province inspected the situation in Changyi, Changqing, Liaocheng, Zhangqiu and other counties, it learned that 80% of the problems raised in the people's letters and visits accepted by these counties in a year have been closed, and those that have not been closed have also been explained. The head of Gaozhai District in Zhangqiu County often inspects and handles people's letters and visits. Gaozhai District has had no backlogged cases for several years. Some units attach great importance to the opinions and problems raised in the people's letters and visits. After receiving a letter from the people criticizing the poor quality of hacksaw blades from the Hardware Factory, the leaders of the Benxi City Industrial Bureau quickly organized technicians together with the factory to conduct research. Finally, they absorbed foreign experience and improved the quality of the hacksaw blades. According to the opinions raised in the people's letters regarding the complicated grain purchase procedures, the Benxi City Grain Bureau improved the shortcomings in its work. As a result, the masses were very satisfied and wrote letters to praise the grain station cadres.

However, the inspection situation proves that many organs and enterprises have not paid enough attention to the handling of people's letters and visits, showing serious bureaucratic work styles. For example, the Industrial Education Department of the Ministry of Higher Education had received more than 100 letters from a college student requesting a transfer, but the Industrial Education Department not only did not seriously study these letters, but even had thirteen letters that had not been opened. They thought that answering such letters was a "trouble". More often, some units showed an irresponsible attitude when handling people's letters, shirking responsibility to each other and delaying the processing time. After receiving a letter criticizing the leaders of the Benxi Winery for not paying attention to the promotion of advanced experience, the Secretary Section of the Benxi City Industrial Bureau forwarded the letter to the Cadre Section, which then forwarded the letter to the Light Industry Section. Finally, the letter was forwarded for more than three months and returned to the Secretary Section.

The Ministry of Supervision and local supervisory organs pointed out in the report on the inspection of the handling of people's letters and visits that the main reasons for these shortcomings in the handling of people's letters and visits are that the leaders of some units do not attach importance to the handling of people's letters and visits, and they treat the criticisms and suggestions of the people with a bureaucratic attitude. Individual department leaders of the Ministry of Higher Education believe that people's letters are some "trivial matters". They not only do not manage the handling of people's letters and visits themselves, but also want others to manage less, resulting in serious delays and backlogs in the handling of people's letters and visits. Another important reason is that some people who do specific work do not have a sufficient understanding of the political significance of handling people's letters and visits, and the leadership neglects to carry out ideological education for serving the people, which makes some people feel bored with this work.

### 认真处理人民来信　正确解决内部矛盾  监察部加强对各单位的监督检查

    认真处理人民来信　正确解决内部矛盾
    监察部加强对各单位的监督检查
    新华社24日讯　各级监察机关把处理人民来信来访工作当作正确处理人民内部矛盾的重要方法之一。它们在最近加强了对国家机关和企业单位的这一工作的监督检查。
    监察部和国务院秘书厅最近重点地检查了高等教育部和劳动部处理人民来信来访工作的情况。另有许多省市监察机关也进行了检查，并向监察部作了检查情况的报告。
    从检查中可以看出，有些机关对处理人民来信来访工作是重视的。劳动部部长马文瑞经常亲自了解处理人民来信来访工作的情况，并督促各司局认真研究处理人民来信来访中提出的意见和问题。据高等教育部所属四个单位最近的统计，在一年内收到的人民来信中有90％已经处理。其余的来信，有的已作了交代，有的正在研究处理。山东省在检查昌邑、长清、聊城、章丘等县的情况时，了解到这些县在一年当中受理的人民来信和来访提出的问题，有80％已经结案，没有结案的也都有了交代。章丘县高寨区区长经常检查并处理人民来信来访工作，几年来高寨区从没有积案。有些单位很重视人民来信来访中提出的意见和问题。本溪市工业局接到批评五金厂锯条质量不好的人民来信后，局的领导方面很快地同厂方共同组织技术人员进行研究，最后他们吸取外地经验，提高了锯条的质量。本溪市粮食局根据人民来信提出的购粮手续繁杂的意见，改进了工作中的缺点，结果群众很满意，他们写信表扬粮站干部。
    但是，检查的情况证明，有不少机关和企业对处理人民来信来访工作并没有给予足够的重视，表现了严重的官僚主义作风。例如高等教育部工业教育司曾收到一个大学生要求转学的信有一百多封，可是工业教育司对这些信不但没有认真研究，甚至于有十三封信还没有拆开过，他们认为答复这样的信是“麻烦”的事情。更多的情况是有些单位在处理人民来信时表现了不负责任的态度，他们互相推诿，延误了处理时间。本溪市工业局秘书科收到批评本溪造酒厂领导方面不重视推广先进经验的来信后，将信转给干部科，干部科又把信转给轻工业科，最后这封信被转了三个多月又回到了秘书科。
    监察部和各地监察机关在检查处理人民来信来访工作的报告中指出，处理人民来信来访工作中产生这些缺点的主要原因是，有些单位的领导人不重视处理人民来信来访工作，他们用官僚主义态度去对待人民群众的批评和建议。高等教育部个别司的领导人员认为人民来信是一些“小事”，他们不仅自己不管处理人民来信来访工作，还要别人少管，以致在处理人民来信来访工作上存在着严重的拖延、积压等现象。还有一个重要原因是有些做具体工作的人对处理人民来信来访工作的政治意义认识不足，领导方面忽视了对他们进行为人民服务的思想教育，这样就使有些人对这项工作有厌烦情绪。
