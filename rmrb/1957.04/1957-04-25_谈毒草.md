    On Poisonous Weeds
    Qiming
    "Let a hundred flowers bloom" originally meant that all flowers bloom together. It was an all-inclusive, unreserved statement. But now some people have raised objections, thinking that there are "poisonous weeds" among the flowers that should not be allowed to bloom. This statement is clearly incorrect. We say that all flowers should be allowed to bloom, regardless of whether they are poisonous weeds or not. We cannot deprive them of their rights based on this qualification. If poisonous weeds have flowers, they should all be allowed to bloom and participate in the competition. If poisonous weeds have no flowers, then there is nothing to let bloom, regardless of whether they are poisonous or not.
    In the "Compendium of Materia Medica," poisonous weeds are listed in a separate volume, with a total of forty-seven species, including aconite and monkshood, as well as Gelsemium elegans, which I have never seen. Generally, the poison of poisonous weeds is in a part of their flowers, leaves, roots, and fruits. It only takes effect when eaten. There is nothing that can be poisoned just by looking at it, like the "visual poison" mentioned in Buddhist scriptures. Therefore, it is always harmless to take a look at whatever poisonous weed it is. Among the forty-seven species in that compendium, there are common ones such as Belamcanda chinensis (blackberry lily), Rhododendron molle (Chinese azalea), Hosta plantaginea (fragrant plantain lily), and Impatiens balsamina (garden balsam). As for the poppy, it was not used as opium in Li Shizhen's time, so it was not included. The custom of growing poisonous weeds for ornamental purposes is especially prevalent in Beijing. Datura stramonium (jimsonweed) blooms with white flowers and bears fruit like tomatoes. It is common for children to be poisoned by accidentally eating it. Oleander, it is said, can poison fish if its leaves fall into a water tank, but it is still popular because its flowers are too luxuriant. It can be seen from this that it is often impossible to restrict it by using the word "poisonous weed," and the more poisonous the weed, the more extraordinarily its flowers bloom, as in the case of Arisaema heterophyllum's "single whip."
    Saying "poisonous weeds" is just a metaphor. There is no "visual poison" in plants, but there can be in articles. It is possible for bad ideas to be entrusted to articles, and one can be poisoned at a glance. There are all kinds of distinctions in thought, some rational and some irrational. Publishing them for everyone to criticize will reveal right and wrong. As for the responsibility of distinguishing right from wrong, that mainly lies with the critics. Now, if we advocate "letting a hundred flowers bloom" but also clamor that poisonous weeds are not allowed to bloom, it is as if those who admit to being poisonous weeds in advance are not allowed to bloom. Is there such a thing in the world? Since we are letting everything bloom, we must let it bloom first. Then you can study it a bit, and make a judgment that there is a problem. Then you can start a discussion. If everyone thinks that this flower is not blooming well, then it is not good. Blooming is blooming, but whether the result of blooming is good or not is another matter. This is not contrary to the principle of "letting a hundred flowers bloom."

    谈毒草
    启明
    百花齐放，本来是说所有的花一齐的都开起来，是一句包括一切、毫无保留的话，但现在有人提出意见，以为花里边有“毒草”，不应该放，这句话显然是不对的。我们说凡是花都应放，不论毒草与否，不能以这个资格剥夺他的权利。毒草如有花，应当一律开放，参加比赛，如毒草没有花，那就没得可放，不关他的毒不毒。
    “本草纲目”中毒草列为一卷，共有四十七种，是乌头、附子之属，也有钩吻即野葛，不曾看见过。大凡毒草的毒，都在花叶根实的一部分里，送进嘴里去吃了，这才发生效力，光是眼睛看了会中毒的，如佛经里所说的“见毒”的东西，那是没有。那末无论它是什么毒草，拿来瞧瞧，总是无妨的。那本草的四十七种里边，就含有我们常见的射干即“花镜”的秋蝴蝶，羊踯躅即牛郎花，玉簪和凤仙花，至于罂粟花，在李时珍时代还没有当作鸦片吸的缘故吧，不曾收入。北京人种毒草赏玩的风气尤其盛，洋金花即风茄开白花，结果子如番茄，小孩误食中毒的事情常常见到，还有夹竹桃据说落在水缸里药得死鱼，可是因为花太穠艳，至今盛行。由此可见，想用毒草这字去限制它，往往做不到，而且愈是毒草，它的花也特别开得出奇，如天南星的“独立一支枪”便是一例。
    说毒草原不过是一种譬喻。植物上没有“见毒”，但文章里是可以有的，不良的思想寄托在文章上，一看就中了毒，也是可能的。思想有种种区别，有合理的，有不合理的，发表出来给大家批评一下子，看出是非，至于辨别是非的责任，那主要是在批评家身上了。现在如提倡“百花齐放”，却又嚷嚷有毒草不许放，好像预先有自己承认是毒草，便不开放似的，天下有这种事么？既然齐放，也总得让它放了出来，随后你再研究它一下子，下判语道这有问题，遂即展开讨论，如果大家以为这花开得不好，那就算是不好。——开是开了，结果开得好不好是别一件事，这样才与“百花齐放”的原则不相违背。
