Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, April 4th: Since 1953, approximately one million junior high and higher primary school graduates in Shandong Province have participated in labor production, with the vast majority engaged in agricultural production.

This new force has played an important role in agricultural production over the past few years. Many people have improved their labor skills, becoming production experts and backbones of agricultural cooperatives, through their active efforts, diligent study, and humble learning from the masses in production. Among the 288 agricultural cooperative accountants trained in Huantai County last year, junior high and higher primary graduates accounted for 210; among the 154 agricultural technicians trained in Changqing County last year, 151 were junior high and higher primary graduates.

In March of this year, 51 junior high and higher primary school graduates attended the Second Shandong Provincial Representative Conference of Activists in Socialist Agricultural Construction, and they were awarded certificates and banners by the Provincial People's Committee.

To guide this year's middle and primary school graduates in further education and employment, Jinan and Qingdao have recently prepared to establish Middle and Primary School Graduates Further Education and Employment Guidance Committees to strengthen students' ideological education, social publicity work, and parental work, so that they can have a correct understanding of students' further education, employment, or participation in labor. Middle and primary school graduates who cannot continue their education or do not have the conditions for employment this year will be organized by the municipal Middle and Primary School Graduates Further Education and Employment Guidance Committees to form self-study groups or enter cultural supplementary schools.

    山东百万中小学毕业生
    成为农业战线上的新生力量
    据新华社济南4日电　从1953年到现在，山东省初中和高小毕业生约有一百万人参加了劳动生产，其中绝大多数参加了农业生产。
    这支新生力量，几年来在农业生产中发挥了重要的作用。许多人由于自己在生产中的积极努力、刻苦钻研和虚心向群众学习，因而提高了劳动本领，成了生产能手和农业社的骨干。桓台县去年训练的二百八十八名农业社会计中，初中和高小毕业生即占二百一十名；长清县去年训练的一百五十四名农业技术员中，即有初中和高小毕业生一百五十一名。
    今年3月，有五十一名初中和高小毕业生出席了山东省第二届社会主义农业建设积极分子代表会议，他们分别得到了省人民委员会奖给的奖状和奖旗。
    为指导今年中、小学毕业生升学、就业，济南、青岛两市最近准备成立中、小学毕业生升学就业指导委员会，以加强学生思想教育、社会宣传工作和家长工作，使他们能对学生升学、就业或参加劳动有正确的认识。今年升不上学或无条件就业的中、小学毕业生，将由各市中、小学毕业生升学、就业指导委员会，统一组织安排他们成立自学小组或进文化补习学校。
