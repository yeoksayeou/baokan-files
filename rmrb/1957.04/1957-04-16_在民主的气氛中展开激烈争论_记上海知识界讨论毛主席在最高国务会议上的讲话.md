    Intense Debate Unfolds in a Democratic Atmosphere
    – On Shanghai Intellectual Circles Discussing Chairman Mao's Speech at the Supreme State Conference
    Our Shanghai Correspondent
    Chairman Mao's speeches at the Supreme State Conference and the National Propaganda Work Conference have been widely disseminated and discussed in Shanghai. It has become a major event in the ideological life of Shanghai's intellectual circles, adding vigorous vitality to the early spring in Shanghai. The universal reflection is that Chairman Mao's speech on how to correctly handle contradictions among the people is another important development that combines Marxism-Leninism with China's specific conditions. It has pushed our ideological level to a new peak. After listening to this speech, many contradictory phenomena in the current domestic life have been correctly answered, horizons have been broadened, and confidence in future endeavors has been greatly enhanced.
    This discussion of Chairman Mao's speech by Shanghai's intellectual circles has been very enthusiastic. Many people who were unwilling to speak or did not speak much in the past have now dispelled their concerns and spoken freely. There have been fierce debates in many symposiums. These are rare phenomena in the past. Many ideological problems have been resolved and many ideological problems have been exposed during the symposiums, which shows that the discussion is being conducted in a normal democratic atmosphere. This discussion is not completely over yet. Below, the reporter will only give a brief report on the main aspects of the discussion.

    "Gentle Breeze and Fine Rain" versus "Dismounting to See the Flowers"
    The relationship between the Party and intellectuals is a relatively prominent issue among the contradictions within the people in Shanghai. Chairman Mao's speech greatly inspired Shanghai intellectuals, and the discussion was also the most enthusiastic.
    After Premier Zhou's report on the issue of intellectuals, the relationship between the Party and Shanghai intellectuals has greatly improved, but some problems still exist. In the symposium, people pointed out that some problems have not been completely resolved. For example, some Party members still have sectarian tendencies towards non-Party intellectuals, and the estrangement has not been completely eliminated. Some people have not been arranged properly, and some new problems have also occurred. Some professors have suggested that after Premier Zhou's policy on intellectuals was put forward, there has been a tendency to relax political and ideological education. Professor Wang Pengwan said: The Party criticizes us less and is more polite. In fact, criticism is still needed. We should use the formula of "unity-criticism-unity" to strengthen unity and political and ideological education.
    However, the ideological remolding of intellectuals should be done in a more subtle way, as Chairman Mao said. People talked a lot about this. Mr. Fu Lei's words are somewhat representative. He said: China's old intellectuals are different from the intellectuals in capitalist countries. They have all experienced the tide of the May Fourth Movement and have progressiveness. The transformation of intellectuals should be based on this characteristic and carried out in a "gentle breeze and fine rain" manner. However, some departments did not do that in the past. They were often overly rude, which hurt people's feelings. He suggested that some measures could be taken to continue to unite and educate some people who have been hurt in the past. Mr. Li Xiaofeng and others analyzed the main reasons for some of the crude practices in the past, which was that some comrades confused the two types of contradictions and misused the methods of dealing with the enemy on their own people. Now that the issue of contradictions among the people has been clarified, and the method of persuasion and education suitable for the people is used, it may be possible to avoid repeating some of the mistakes of the past.
     "The relationship between intellectuals and workers is like that between the Han nationality and minority nationalities. We owed too much in the past, and now we have to repay it." This is a heartfelt statement from Mr. Peng Peng of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. Many intellectuals at the meeting expressed their desire to better serve workers, peasants, and soldiers in the future. To educate the people, one must first be educated oneself and learn from the masses and from practice. Mr. Yuan Xiluo said well: "To be honest, the knowledge of intellectuals is limited. Since Confucius, intellectuals have been somewhat arrogant and like to be teachers, which is really misleading. There is an old saying in China: 'Live and learn, and there are still three points that you can't learn.' If you want to be a teacher of the people, you must learn even more." Many people at the meeting suggested that they should strive for more opportunities to go to factories and rural areas to get close to the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and not just "take a cursory look" but to "dismount to see the flowers" carefully and deeply understand the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Mr. Chen Changheng, a social figure, suggested that the local people's political consultative conferences can be more responsible for organizing visits to the countryside and factories.

    "Old Bones Must Be Primary School Students"
    After the report on Chairman Mao's report on the people's internal contradiction was conveyed, some cadres (including some more responsible cadres), especially some party member cadres, felt great pressure on their ideology. It is quite commonly believed that "work will be more difficult in the future, and leadership will be more difficult." To the "left" is dogmatism and sectarianism; to the "right" is to fear committing opportunism and losing one's position. Therefore, they are hesitant to work and afraid of making mistakes. They always complain about the leadership and the objective. Some people dare not speak in the investigation of plays for fear of affecting unity. These cadres more or less put themselves in the position of onlookers and divorced themselves from the current political struggle. The comrades of the Luwan District Committee of the CPC generally do not care enough about the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom. They think this is "a matter for the city" and are not clear about how to implement it. They are hesitant and worried, saying that "everyone has their own reasons, who is right, it is not easy to grasp." A minister of the Yulin District Committee doubts "whether raising ideology and raising awareness must release idealism? Will it affect the Marxist-Leninist position after it is released?" Some cadres believe that there is not too much "release" at present, but not enough, and it should be released in the future. Only in this way can the contradictions within the people be correctly resolved. Many party members and cadres believe that the Chinese revolution has entered a new period, and they are wary of falling behind in the face of the new era. If you don't know how to deal with the contradictions within the people, you have to learn; if your knowledge is not enough, you have to catch up quickly; if the burden of work is heavy, you have to shoulder it well. Comrades Xu Pingyu and Chen Shan both expressed at the discussion meeting: After the contradictions within the people were put forward, the task was very heavy and we must study hard. Comrade Chen Shan said: Now "persuasion and education" is many times more difficult than the past "suppression". We must study hard. "The books on dialectics have been covered with dust." Comrade Xu Pingyu believes that in order to make the hundred flowers bloom achieve unity and improvement through chaos, we must study. The old set is not enough and new knowledge is lacking. In the midst of earth-shaking changes, the old bones must be primary school students.
    Many cadres have realized in their actual work that correctly handling contradictions among the people is a good medicine to turn worries into blessings. Cadres in charge of public security work believe in the discussion that correctly understanding the issue of contradictions among the people has practical significance for public security work. If the understanding of the situation is not deep, it is very possible to regard the main contradiction as the secondary contradiction and treat non-antagonistic contradictions as antagonistic contradictions. The director of the Putuo District Public Security Bureau felt that he used to like to use the name of the Public Security Bureau to oppress people, but now he realizes that there should be analysis. Some cadres in the past did not have many ways to deal with the contradictions such as employment for graduates in 1957 and were not confident. After listening to the report, they believed that the method of persuasion and education could be used to solve the problem. The comrades of the Shanghai Peking Opera Theater said: In the past, there were many opinions on the shortcomings of the leadership, but now we know that this is an internal contradiction, and we should use the correct method to solve it.
    In this ideological change, some cadres still cannot grasp it, and always feel that "left" is better than "right". There is such a thing: the staff of Longhua Nursery raised about 200 opinions to the leadership. After analyzing the results, most of the opinions are correct. The nursery leadership held a mass meeting, and at the meeting, they expressed their acceptance of everyone's opinions, and the problem was solved. The Garden Management Office believes that this is very good and we should sum up the experience and inform all units. However, the person in charge who directly led this unit severely criticized it, thinking that this was wrong and rejected the correct practice. Under the impact of new ideas, although there are still some people who always want to use the old methods to deal with the issue of contradictions among the people. However, many, many cadres and party members are willing to be tempered in the torrent of this era and actively and actively participate in the struggle. When some more responsible cadres of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee discussed Chairman Mao's report, they deeply felt that they should learn Chairman Mao's method of handling problems, see the favorable factors from the unfavorable aspects, and carry out revolutionary work with full confidence.

    "Starting from 600 Million People"
     The policy of "overall planning and appropriate arrangement" is one of the most hotly debated centers in many symposiums in Shanghai. People say that China is a big country with a population of 600 million. All national affairs must be handled from the perspective of 600 million people to carry out overall planning and appropriate arrangements. This is a strategic policy for resolving contradictions among the people. In the discussion, people paid special attention to the following things: the problem of enrollment of primary and secondary school students, social employment, birth control, and so on. Especially the problem of enrollment, several groups of the Shanghai Democratic League and the China Association for Promoting Democracy focused on it. They believe that it is completely correct to solve the problem of enrollment from the perspective of overall planning and appropriate arrangement, but the education department has not arranged it well in the past. Mr. Liu Zhemin, Mr. Zhang Yunceng and many others criticized that the work in this area in the past was like a gust of wind. One gust of wind could allow everyone to go to school, and another gust of wind could not allow everyone to go to school. The next gust of wind said that universal education should be implemented, but now it says that 40% of school-age children cannot go to school. This shows that the education department did not master the policy of overall planning and appropriate arrangement in the past.
    Now that the policy has been clarified, people can use this to think of ways to resolve the contradictions. At the symposium, people put forward many suggestions for solving the problem of enrollment. Mr. Chen Wangdao and Mr. Zhang Jiangshu said: Universities can use existing teachers and equipment to set up affiliated middle schools (starting from the first year of high school). This kind of affiliated middle school has the nature of a private school, and the professors teach voluntarily, but the children of teachers and staff should be admitted first. Mr. Zhang Rui, Mr. Cheng Yingliu, and Mr. Jiang Jianqiu all said: Now we can "open up a free market" in the education sector in a timely manner, mobilize social forces to run private primary schools, tutoring classes, and refresher courses. The location and furniture of the private schools can use the original literacy equipment of the neighborhood committees. Shen Fangcheng, the wife of Mr. Hu Juewen, and Mr. Wu Langxi suggested: Junior high school graduates and some knowledgeable housewives can be private school teachers, and they can also strive for capitalists to take out some fixed interest as funding. Many other people have put forward various suggestions, such as middle schools can implement a three-part system and a seven-day system, universities can also implement a two-part system, the school system should be appropriately reformed, and the study time of middle and primary schools can be appropriately shortened. The government should encourage self-study, conduct regular examinations, and give certain names to those who have excellent examination results. It can also absorb some people into the service industry to be successors, and so on. In short, under the plan of overall planning and appropriate arrangement, mobilizing social forces and using various methods, this problem can still be solved.
    Birth control is also a major event related to 600 million people. Most people in the discussion supported the implementation of birth control, but some people raised objections. Mr. Yuan Xiluo and other social figures believe that the Chinese population is not a matter of control, but a matter of immigration, because some places have a sparse population. Mr. Lei Pingyi of the China National Democratic Construction Association reminded that there are misunderstandings about the propaganda on birth control in some small cities and rural areas. They thought that "the Communist Party does not allow people to have children," so they rushed to get married. Some religious figures oppose contraception, especially abortion. An elder of a Christian church cited an event in the Bible and said: Judah's son had an abortion, and God did not give blessings but punished him. Some Catholic gentlemen believe that abortion "violates the Sixth Commandment." In short, everyone at the discussion meeting expressed various different opinions based on their own views without reservation.

    Overthrow Dogmatism, Boldly "Release" and Boldly "Contend"
    To release rather than to收, this is the common language of the vast majority of cultural circles in Shanghai. Xu Junyuan of the Cultural Publishing House said: "Now I dare to speak freely, because I have a bottom in my heart. In the past, I doubted the policy of 'release' and 'contend'. Everyone criticized Lin Fang's one-sided theory in Xinmin Evening News and besieged Wang Meng. In this way, I have to see the market conditions. Some party members in People's Publishing House used to think that Chen Qitong's article was good, so we doubted whether the party's policy had changed. Now I have solved these problems." A non-party friend of Xinmin Evening News said: In the past, a friend compared the hundred flowers bloom to a mousetrap. The mouse saw the meat, stretched out its head, and was caught by the mousetrap. Before going to the meeting in Beijing, I also agreed with this view, but now I am convinced of the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom.
    The novel group of the Shanghai Writers Association strictly criticized dogmatism in the discussion. Someone said that the dogmatic forces in Shanghai are very strong, and less than 10% agree with bold release. If dogmatism is not overthrown, it will be difficult to "release" and "contend." Someone said that the reason why "release" could not be released in the past was related to the editorial department. The editor did not respect the author, but wanted the author to obey the editorial department and release flowers according to the intention of the editorial department. Someone said that there are still many rules and regulations in children's literature at present. Recently, there was a cartoon with the content that many brothers divided oranges and gave the big ones to the youngest brother to eat. A comrade from the Education Bureau saw the painting and said: "This cartoon is very good, but unfortunately, the orange peels were not thrown into the wastebasket." Everyone thought this was an example of dogmatism.
    Many comrades in the editorial department of the Shanghai Film Studio put forward their own views on the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Bao Shi said: "Are only the themes of workers, peasants, and soldiers fragrant flowers? If Li Tianji writes about the transformation of prostitutes, can it be considered fragrant flowers? I don't understand." Yu Shan criticized the Shanghai Film Studio's leadership's view on the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers as dogmatic. He said: "The reason why we accepted dogmatism in the past is because we also have dogmatism in our minds." Another comrade said: "Some writers now don't even want the theme thought when writing things, and they call it anti-formulaization and conceptualization. Don't be alarmed by the opposition to dogmatism, and everything is dogmatic."
    Some people in the drama world advocate releasing, but believe that leadership must be strengthened at the same time. Tao Xiong said: "Releasing does not mean not wanting socialism, but to 'release' it for everyone to understand. Leading cadres cannot decide which one to want and which one not to want, but they cannot ignore it. How to strengthen leadership is a big problem."

   "Two Goods Combined into One Good"
    One of the most hotly debated issues in Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles is the nature of the contradiction between the national bourgeoisie and the working class. After listening to Chairman Mao's report, many people in the industrial and commercial circles felt "at ease".
    Wei Wenhan of the water transportation industry believed that the dictatorship of the proletariat was always the dictatorship of the working class over the landlords and the bourgeoisie. He was very inspired by listening to the report and clarified that he was within democracy, and the dictatorship was only against the enemy. While clarifying this issue, people in the industrial and commercial circles have a deeper understanding that the transformation of the originally antagonistic contradiction into a non-antagonistic contradiction certainly has China's specific historical conditions, but if there were no "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, the transformation of the contradiction would be slower. Therefore, many people believe that although the democracy of the "Five-Anti" and "Three-Anti" was a little bigger, it was still very necessary. Yan Jinxing of the rubber industry said: "We must correctly understand the transformation of this contradiction and not relax the transformation, otherwise it will revive." Chu Rongsheng of the construction engineering industry said a meaningful sentence: Two goods combined into one good! The Party and the government put the national bourgeoisie in the second type of contradiction; the capitalists are also willing to do so. Isn't this two goods combined into one good!
    When the industrial and commercial circles discussed Chairman Mao's speech, some people still did not understand the two-sidedness of the national bourgeoisie. They believed that this was打击了资本家的积极性. However, more people disagree with this view. Dong Yinchu of the industrial and commercial circles said: "Only a few people do not need to be transformed. The main reason for relaxing the transformation is that subjectively, the fixed interest rate for seven years has the idea of 'being sure', and objectively, the work of the Democratic National Construction Association and the Federation of Industry and Commerce has not been done well." Some people in the industrial and commercial circles also requested that the CPPCC, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, trade associations, and other relevant parties closely cooperate to strengthen ideological education for private personnel and overcome the past chaos in which all parties grabbed but did not do it deeply and thoroughly.

    在民主的气氛中展开激烈争论
    ——记上海知识界讨论毛主席在最高国务会议上的讲话
    本报驻上海记者
    毛主席在最高国务会议和中央宣传工作会议上的讲话，已在上海进行了普遍的传达和讨论，它已形成了上海知识界思想生活中的一件大事，给初春的上海，更增添了蓬蓬勃勃的生气。人们的普遍反映是：毛主席这个关于如何正确处理人民内部矛盾的讲话，是马克思列宁主义与中国具体情况相结合的又一个重要发展，它把我们的思想水平又推到了一个新的高峰，听了这个讲话以后，对目前国内生活中的许多矛盾现象，都得到正确的解答了，眼界打开了，对今后的事业也更加充满了信心。
    上海知识界这次对毛主席讲话的讨论，非常热烈，好些过去不肯说话或不多说话的人，这次都解除顾虑，滔滔地畅所欲言。好些座谈会上都有激烈的争论。这些都是过去稀见的现象。座谈中解决了许多思想问题，也暴露了许多思想问题，这都说明讨论是在正常的民主气氛中进行的。这个讨论，现在还没有完全结束。下面，记者只是就几个讨论的主要方面，作一个概略的报道。“和风细雨”与“下马看花”
    党与知识分子的关系，是上海人民内部矛盾中的一个比较突出的问题。毛主席这次的讲话给上海知识分子以很大振奋，讨论得也最热烈。
    周总理关于知识分子问题的报告以后，党与上海知识分子的关系大有改善，但也还存在一些问题。在座谈中，人们提出有的问题解决还不彻底，例如有些党员对党外知识分子仍有宗派主义倾向，隔阂并未完全消除。有些人安排得也还不甚恰当，也有些新的问题发生。有些教授提出，周总理关于知识分子政策提出后，有些放松政治思想教育的倾向。王鹏万教授就说：党对我们批评少了，更客气了，其实，批评还是需要的，我们应当运用“团结—批评—团结”的公式，来加强团结和政治思想教育。
    但是知识分子的思想改造，应当像毛主席所说的那样，方式要细一些。这点，人们谈得很多。傅雷先生的话有一定代表性。他说：中国的旧知识分子不同于资本主义国家的知识分子，他们都经过五四运动的浪潮，有进步性。对知识分子的改造应该根据这个特点，和风细雨地进行。但过去有些部门的做法却不是那样，常常过分粗暴，这很伤人的感情。他建议对过去已经伤过感情的一些人，可以采取些措施继续团结教育他们。李小峰先生等并分析了过去产生某些粗暴作法的主要原因，是有些同志把两类矛盾混淆起来了，对自己人错用了对付敌人的方法。现在明确了人民内部矛盾问题，要用适合于人民内部的说服教育方法，就可能避免再重复过去的某些错误了。
      “知识分子对工人的关系，正如汉族对少数民族一样，以前欠的债太多，现在要归还。”这是农工民主党彭朋先生发自内心深处的一段话。许多知识分子在会上都表明了今后应当更好地为工农兵服务的心愿。要教育人民，自己就首先得受教育，向群众、向实际学习。袁希洛先生说得好：“说实在话，知识分子的知识是有限的，自孔子以后，知识分子就有些自高自大、好为人师，实在是误人子弟。中国有句老话：‘做到老，学到老，还有三分学不到’，要做人民的先生，自己就更得学习。”好些人在会上提出，今后要争取更多机会下工厂，下农村，去接近工农群众，不要只是“走马观花”地走一趟，要认真地“下马看花”，深一步地了解工农兵。社会人士陈长蘅先生建议，今后地方人民政协可以多负责组织一些下乡下厂等参观活动。“老骨头要当小学生”
    在传达毛主席关于人民内部矛盾的报告以后，有些干部（也包括一些比较负责的干部），特别是一些党员干部，感到思想上压力很大。相当普遍地认为：今后“工作难做了，领导难当了”。“左”了是教条主义和宗派主义；“右”了又怕犯机会主义，丧失了立场。所以，工作起来缩手缩脚，怕犯错误，总是埋怨领导，埋怨客观。有的人在调查剧目中，不敢发言，怕影响团结。这些干部或多或少把自己置于旁观者的地位，脱离了当前的政治斗争。中共卢湾区区委同志对百家争鸣的方针较普遍的表现是不够关心，认为这是“市里的事”，对究竟如何贯彻也不明确，缩手缩脚，忧虑重重，说是“公说公有理、婆说婆有理、究竟谁对，不好掌握。”榆林区委一个部长怀疑“提高思想提高觉悟是否一定要放唯心主义？放出以后会不会影响马列主义阵地？”有的干部认为目前不是“放”的太多，而是不够，今后还要放。只有这样，才能正确解决人民内部的矛盾。许多党员、干部认为中国革命进入了一个新的时期，警惕自己不要在新时代面前落伍。不会处理人民内部矛盾，要学；自己知识不够了，要赶快补上；工作担子重了，更要很好地担起来。徐平羽、陈山同志在讨论会上都表示：人民内部矛盾提出以后，任务很重，必须好好学习。陈山同志说：现在“说服教育”比过去的“压”，不知难多少倍了，要很好学习“辩证法的书已积满了灰尘了”。徐平羽同志认为要使百家争鸣通过乱而达到统一、提高，必须学习，过去的一套不够了，新的知识缺乏，翻天复地当中老骨头要当小学生了。
    许多干部已经在实际工作中体会到：正确处理人民内部矛盾，是化忧为福的良药。负责公安工作的干部在讨论中认为：正确认识人民内部矛盾问题，对公安工作有现实意义。如果了解情况不深，很可能将主要矛盾当次要矛盾；把非对抗性矛盾当作对抗性矛盾。普陀区公安分局局长觉得过去是喜欢用公安局名义压人，现在认识到应有分析。有的干部过去对1957年就学就业等矛盾的处理，办法不多，信心不高，听了报告以后，认为用说服教育的办法可以解决。上海京剧院的同志说：过去对领导上的缺点意见多，现在知道这是内部矛盾，应用正确办法解决。
    在这个思想变动中，有些干部还是把握不住的，总觉得“左”比“右”好点。有这样一件事；龙华苗圃职工向领导上提了约二百条意见。经分析的结果，大部分意见是正确的。苗圃领导上召开了群众大会，在会上表示接受大家意见，问题解决了。园林管理处认为这样做很好，要好好总结经验，通报各单位。但是，直接领导这个单位的负责同志却严加批评，认为这样做不对，把正确的做法，一棒子打回去了。在新的思想冲击下，虽然还有一些人总想用老办法来对待人民内部矛盾问题。但是，许多许多的干部、党员是愿意在这时代的洪流里受到锻炼，主动、积极地参加到斗争中来。上海市委一些比较负责的干部在讨论毛主席报告的时候，深切地感到要学习毛主席处理问题的方法，从不利的方面看出有利的因素，充满信心地进行革命工作。“从六亿人口出发”
      “统筹兼顾、适当安排”的方针，是上海市许多座谈会上人们讨论最热烈的中心之一，人们说，中国是一个六亿人口的大国，处理国家事务都得从六亿人口出发，来进行统筹兼顾，适当安排，这是解决人民内部矛盾的一条战略方针。在讨论中，人们特别关心到下列几件事：中小学生升学问题，社会就业，节育等等。尤其是升学问题，上海民主同盟、民主促进会的几个小组都集中地进行了讨论。他们认为从统筹兼顾、适当安排的方针出发来解决升学问题是完全正确的，但过去教育部门在这方面没有安排好。刘哲民、张云澄先生等好些人都批评到过去这方面的工作就仿佛是刮风，一阵风是都可以上学，一阵风又不能全上学了，下阵风说要实行普遍教育了，现在又说40％的学龄儿童不能上学了，这说明教育工作部门过去没有掌握好统筹兼顾、适当安排的方针。
    现在明确了方针，人们就可以据此想办法来解决矛盾。座谈会上，人们提出了许多解决升学问题的建议。陈望道、张江树先生说：各大学可利用现有师资、设备，设立附属中学（从高一办起）。这种附属中学带有私塾性质，由教授们义务执教，但首先要吸收教职员子弟入学。张锐、程应镠、姜鉴秋等先生都说到：现在可及时在教育界“开放自由市场”，发动社会力量来办民办小学、补习班、进修班，私塾的地点、家具可利用居民委员会原有的扫盲设备。胡厥文先生的夫人沈方成和吴朗西先生建议：初中毕业生和部分家庭知识妇女，可以当私塾教师，还可以争取资本家拿出一些定息来作经费。还有许多人提出了各种建议，例如中学可以实行三部制和七天制，大学也可以实行二部制，学制要作适当改革，中、小学学习时间可适当缩短。政府应鼓励自学，定期考试，考试成绩优良的给予一定名义。还可以吸收一些人到服务性行业去做接班人等等。总之，在统筹兼顾、适当安排的方案之下，发动社会力量，利用多种方式，这个问题还是可以解决的。
    节育也是当前关系六亿人民的一件大事，讨论中大部分人都拥护实行节育，但也有人提出异议。社会人士袁希洛等先生认为中国人口不是节制问题，而是移民问题，因为有的地方人口过稀。民主建国会雷平一先生提醒说，关于节育的宣传有些小城市和农村里发生误解，以为是“共产党不让人养孩子”，便抢着结婚。有些宗教界的先生反对避孕，尤其反对人工流产。一位基督教长老举圣经中的事说：犹大的儿子堕了胎，神是不降福而给以处罚。天主教的有些先生认为人工流产“违反第六戒”。总之，讨论会上人们都根据自己的观点，无保留地说出了各种不同的意见。打倒教条主义，大胆“放”大胆“鸣”
    要放而不要收，这是上海绝大部分文化界人士共同的语言。文化出版社许君远说：“现在我敢畅所欲言了，因为心中有了底。过去我对‘放’‘鸣’的政策是怀疑的，大家在反对新民报上林放的片面论，围剿王蒙，这样，我得看看行情。人民出版社有些党员过去觉得陈其通的文章好，我们就怀疑党的政策是否变了。现在这些问题我都解决了。”新民报一位党外朋友说：过去有个朋友把百家争鸣比作捕鼠机，老鼠看见肉，伸出头来，就被捕鼠机扣住。在未到北京开会前，我也同意这个看法，但现在我是信服百家争鸣的政策了。
    上海作家协会小说组讨论中严格地批评了教条主义。有人说，上海的教条主义势力很强，赞成大胆放的10％也不到。如果不打垮教条主义，“放”“鸣”是有困难的。有人说，过去“放”不出来和编辑部有关，编辑不尊重作者，而是要作者服从编辑部，根据编辑部的意图放花。有人说目前儿童文学中清规戒律还很多，最近有幅漫画，内容是许多兄弟分橘子，把大的分给最小的弟弟吃。教育局一位同志看了画说：“这幅漫画很好，可惜没有把橘子皮丢在字纸篓里。”大家觉得这是教条主义的一个例子。
    上海电影制片厂编辑处许多同志对工农兵的方向问题提出了自己的看法。包时说：“是否只有工农兵题材才有香花？如李天济写了妓女改造这个题材，是否也能算香花？我不明白。”羽山批评上海电影制片厂领导方面对工农兵方向问题的看法是教条主义的。他说：“过去我们所以接受教条主义，因为自己头脑中也有教条主义。”另一位同志说：“有些作家现在写东西连主题思想都不要了，美其名是反公式化、概念化。反对教条主义不要草木皆兵，什么都是教条。”
    戏剧界有些人主张放，但认为同时必须加强领导。陶雄说：“放不是说不要社会主义，而是‘放’出来让大家认识。领导干部不能决定那个要那个不要，但也不能不管。如何加强领导是个大问题。”
  “两好并一好”
    上海工商界争论最热烈的一个问题，是民族资产阶级和工人阶级的矛盾的性质问题。听了毛主席的报告以后，工商界许多人感到“心定了”。
    水上运输业魏文翰认为过去以为无产阶级专政总是工人阶级对地主、资产阶级的专政。听了报告很有启发，明确了自己是在民主之内的，专政仅仅是对敌人。在明确这个问题的同时，工商界人士更深地体会到：本来是对抗性矛盾变成非对抗性的矛盾固然有中国特定的历史条件，但如果没有“三反”、“五反”运动，矛盾的转化是要缓慢一些的。因此，有不少人认为“五反”、“三反”的民主虽然大了一些，还是十分必要。橡胶业颜金星说：“我们要正确认识这个矛盾的转化，不要放松改造，否则又要死灰复燃。”建筑工程业褚荣生说了一句意味深长的话：两好并一好！党和政府把民族资产阶级放在第二类矛盾里；资本家也愿意这样做。这不是两好并一好吗！
    工商界在讨论毛主席的讲话的时候，有些人对民族资产阶级的两面性，还是思想不通。认为这样提是打击了资本家的积极性。可是，更多的人是不同意这种看法的。工商界董寅初说：“不要改造的只是少数，主要是放松改造，原因是主观上因定息七年而有‘笃定’思想，客观上是民建和工商联工作没有搞好。”部分工商界人士还要求政协、工商联、同业公会等有关方面密切配合，加强对私方人员的思想教育工作，克服过去各方面乱抓，但又搞得不深不透的混乱现象。
