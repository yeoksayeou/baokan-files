Xinhua News Agency reporter He Changhua reports: Since the beginning of this year, Shanghai's steelmaking workers' steelmaking records have consistently been at the forefront of the nation.

The workers of the converter workshop of Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant will have overfulfilled their plan for 30 consecutive months. Despite a reduction in scrap steel and increased use of pig iron at the beginning of this year, the number of heats of steel blown daily in January and February still averaged more than 144, seven to twenty-two heats more than converters in steel plants such as Daye and Tangshan. In March, up to the 25th, an average of one more heat of steel was produced daily than in January and February.

The furnace bottom utilization coefficient of the two open-hearth furnaces at Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant was the highest among small and medium-sized open-hearth furnaces in the country in January and February; the average daily steel output per square meter of furnace bottom was one to five tons more than that of open-hearth furnaces in steel plants in Taiyuan, Tianjin, Chongqing, and other places. After adopting measures such as hot charging of molten iron last year, the output of each heat of steel in this open-hearth furnace workshop has increased, and the smelting time has been shortened by more than one hour.

In February, the open-hearth furnace workshop of Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant averaged only three hours and a few minutes to produce a heat of steel, making it the workshop with the shortest smelting time among small and medium-sized open-hearth furnaces in the country.

According to the Shanghai Iron and Steel Company, Shanghai's iron and steel industry is expected to produce more than 5,000 tons of steel than planned in the first quarter. (Attached picture)

    上海工人炼钢纪录名列前茅
    新华社记者贺昌华报道：今年以来，上海炼钢工人的炼钢纪录，一直站在全国的最前列。
    上海第一钢厂转炉车间的工人们将要连续三十一个月超额完成计划。尽管今年一开始就减少了废钢、多用了生铁，但是一、二月份每天吹炼钢的炉数仍然平均达到一百四十四炉多，比大冶、唐山等钢厂的转炉每天要多出七炉到二十二炉不等。三月份到二十五日为止，平均每天又比一、二月份多炼出一炉钢。
    上海第三钢厂的两座平炉，一、二月份的炉底利用系数，是全国中小型平炉中最高的；平均每天每一平方公尺炉底的钢产量，比太原、天津、重庆等地钢厂的平炉要多产一吨到五吨钢。这个平炉车间去年采取了热装铁水等措施以后，现在每一炉钢的产量比原来增多，冶炼时间也缩短了一小时多。
    上海第一钢厂平炉车间二月份平均只要三小时十几分钟就炼出一炉钢，也是全国中小型平炉中冶炼时间最短的一个车间。
    据上海钢铁公司预计，上海钢铁工业第一季度可以比计划多炼五千多吨钢。（附图片）
