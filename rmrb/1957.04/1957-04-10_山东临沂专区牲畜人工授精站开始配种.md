Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 9th. The eight new horse artificial insemination stations established in Linyi Prefecture, Shandong Province this year have now begun mating and providing technical guidance.

Since the beginning of spring, the agricultural departments of Linyi Prefecture have organized forces to promote the benefits of improving draft animals to farmers, and have specially introduced more than 250 fine breeds of stallions and bulls from Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, Luxi and other regions, selling them to agricultural cooperatives at 70% of the original price.

Farmers in many parts of Linyi Prefecture have traditionally bred draft animals; however, in the past, mixed grazing and indiscriminate mating had led to a decline in the quality of draft animals.

    山东临沂专区牲畜人工授精站开始配种
    新华社临沂9日电　山东省临沂专区今年新建立的八处马人工授精站，现在都已经开始配种和进行技术指导等活动。
    入春以来，临沂专区的农业部门就组织力量，向农民宣传改良耕畜的好处，并且特地从东北、内蒙古、鲁西等地区引进两百五十多头优良种马、种牛，以原价的70％卖给了农业社。
    临沂专区许多地方的农民素来有繁殖耕畜的习惯；但是过去由于混群放牧，野交滥配，造成了耕畜质量的下降。
