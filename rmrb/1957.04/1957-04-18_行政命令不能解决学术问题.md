    Administrative Orders Cannot Solve Academic Problems
    Tang Lan
    Language reform is a complex scientific issue that should be carefully discussed, not hastily undertaken.
    In 1956, our Party put forward the correct policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend." Only a Marxist-Leninist party could propose this correct policy because genuine gold fears no fire; Marxism-Leninism can withstand the test of struggle; truth becomes clearer through debate. Despite the saying "The Tao is one foot high, the demon is ten feet high," when the truth of Marxism-Leninism shines brightly, all demons will naturally disappear. Therefore, only a Marxist-Leninist party dares to propose such a policy.
    However, some comrades are afraid of this policy. I have heard people worrying, saying: "Idealism is on the rise. They were once professors in universities, they have their ways, and they have a segment of the masses. What about us? We clearly know they are wrong, but we can't argue with them convincingly. We are not prepared for a struggle now." Therefore, they feel that "it cannot be let loose, contention is not allowed." They do not understand constantly learning in struggle, but are afraid of struggle.
    Other comrades fundamentally do not want such a policy. They support it in words but oppose it in deeds, saying that this policy will throw the world into chaos. They are accustomed to the ideology of "one flower blooms alone, one school of thought contends alone," being high above, acting self-importantly. Their own thinking is rigid; they are unwilling to humbly learn, unwilling to understand others, unable to tolerate different opinions, and unwilling to hear any criticism. The proposal of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" has hurt their self-esteem and hindered them from establishing their prestige, so it is no wonder that they want to obstruct and oppose it.
    China's past cultural heritage is extremely brilliant. Unfortunately, in the last hundred years, due to the impact of imperialism, people have almost "forgotten their ancestors." Some nativists cannot see the development of things and are unwilling to acknowledge any modern progress, which is certainly wrong. But why shouldn't we want the excellent heritage of our ancestors? Some literary figures do not acknowledge that China has great literary works; with the emergence of 19th-century foreign linguistics, they reject the Chinese philology that has independently developed for two thousand years; in reforming Chinese characters, they painstakingly try to overthrow the commonly used characters with thousands of years of historical experience and create a Latinized new script.
    What is frightening is that some believers of "the moon is always brighter in foreign lands" are often in leadership positions. They let one school of thought contend alone, and the opinions of the masses are left in "complete silence." What is frightening is that important issues are resolved only with administrative orders.
    From the history of the development of Chinese characters, I have always insisted that Chinese characters have great advantages, and their shortcomings such as complexity and difficulty in learning can be gradually overcome. It is correct that Chinese character reform should follow the common phonetic direction of various countries in the world, but it should have its own national form based on the development laws of Chinese characters, retain all its advantages, and not abruptly change its system. Since liberation, my opinions have been subjected to much suppression and discrimination. In 1955, due to the Party's call to launch free discussions within the scientific field, I submitted my opinions to the leadership, which were forwarded to the China Language and Writing Reform Committee and published in the first issue of "Chinese Language" in 1956. The China Language and Writing Reform Committee organized more than twenty people to criticize and clarify my arguments. Later, Mr. Chen Mengjia said that the China Language and Writing Reform Committee had sent someone to ask him to criticize it, saying it was a "political task." Another friend said that universities in other provinces received printed copies of my article and were asked to criticize it. Therefore, Mr. Chen once advised me, "This is policy, don't argue about it." After the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" was put forward, the China Language and Writing Reform Committee invited me to a written discussion. I thought "Discussions should be allowed. If different opinions are immediately met with harsh criticism, everyone will become even more fearful and silent, thinking everything is fine." But the editorial of "Chinese Language," in addition to expressing its loyalty to support and resolutely implement the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," also put forward some rigid rules, such as: "Dogmatism that quotes scriptures and detaches from reality, or daring not face reality and attempting to cite authoritative statements to defend one's own incorrect views, is not beneficial to the progress of contention." It also said: "When the vast majority agree to make a temporary conclusion, a minority can abandon or retain their own opinions." And "preventing enemies from infiltrating our ranks and using the excuse of 'Let a hundred schools of thought contend' to carry out reactionary propaganda," and so on. This cautious attitude does not seem to indicate a determination to implement the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend."
    I have always believed that linguistics is important, and philology is also important, and should not be discriminated against. Characters certainly reflect language, but should not merely reflect language. Especially Chinese characters, with thousands of years of historical experience, contain countless rich cultural heritages, are a form familiar to every citizen, and are an indispensable tool in daily life. To completely discard them and start anew, to create characters based on language; to imitate foreign characters, not only creating individual characters but also creating words, suddenly creating tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of different words; if these words need to be differentiated to avoid homophones; the masses need to learn tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of new words from scratch; this kind of earth-shattering ambition is grand, whether it can be done, and whether it is worth doing, still needs to be carefully considered.
    What is strange is that the draft of the "Hanyu Pinyin Scheme" devised using Latin letters has not yet been approved by the State Council, but it has already been arranged for learning in some middle schools in Beijing. This is not easy for middle school students. If this scheme still needs to be reconsidered, is premature promotion beneficial?
    Language reform is a complex scientific issue, and at the same time, it is a political task related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, with a very significant impact. It should consider time, conditions, historical environment, and national characteristics, and should gradually develop from the existing foundation, rather than depending on the subjective wishes of a part of the people and starting all over again; it should be carefully discussed and deeply studied, rather than being eager for quick results and rushing into things. Everyone should be allowed to speak freely and without any worries, and even humble opinions should be considered, rather than relying solely on decisions at meetings and simple administrative orders.
    The policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" is still not sufficiently implemented at present. It should be thoroughly implemented. Only through thorough implementation can various thoughts be gradually unified and can the masses better understand the truth of Marxism-Leninism.

    行政命令不能解决学术问题
    唐兰
    文字改革是复杂的科学问题，应该慎重讨论，而不应该草率从事。
    1956年我们党提出了“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，是十分正确的方针。只有马列主义的党才能提出这个正确的方针，因为真金不怕火炼，马列主义经得起斗争的考验，真理愈辩而愈明，尽管“道高一尺，魔高一丈”，到了马列主义的真理赤日当空，一切邪魔，自然敛迹。因此，也只有马列主义的党，才敢于提出这样的方针。
    但是有些同志是害怕这个方针的。我曾听见有人在发愁，说：“唯心主义在抬头了。他们在大学里当过教授，有一套，有一部分群众。我们呢？明明知道他们是错误的，但是干巴巴地说不过他们。现在进行斗争，我们还没有准备。”因此，觉得“放不得，争鸣不得”。他们不懂得在斗争中不断学习，反而害怕斗争。
    另外一些同志压根儿不愿意有这样的方针，口头拥护，阳奉阴违，说这个方针，将使天下大乱。他们习惯于一花独放，一家独鸣，高高在上，唯我独尊的思想。自己的思想僵化了，不肯虚心学习，不去了解别人，不能容纳不同意见，不愿意听到任何批评。提出“百花齐放、百家争鸣”，伤害了他们的自尊心，妨碍了他们树立威信，那就难怪他们要阻碍、要反对了。
    中国过去的文化遗产是十分辉煌的，可惜近百年来受帝国主义的打击，人们几乎“数典忘祖”了。有些国粹主义者看不见事物的发展，不肯承认一切现代的进步的东西，固然是错误的。但为什么不要我们祖先的优秀的遗产呢？有些文学家不承认我国有伟大的文学作品；有了十九世纪外国新兴的语言学，就不要中国独立发展了两千年的文字学；改革中国文字，处心积虑要推翻有几千年历史经验的通用文字而创造拉丁化新文字。
    可怕的是“月亮也是外国好”的信徒们有些往往还处于领导地位，他们一家独鸣，群众的意见只好“万籁俱寂”。可怕的是重要问题只用行政命令来解决。
    从中国文字发展的历史来说，我始终坚持中国文字有很大优点，它的繁复难学等缺点是可以逐渐克服的。中国文字改革，要走世界各国共同的拼音方向，是正确的，但应该根据中国文字的发展规律，有它自己的民族形式，保留它的一切优点，不去骤然改变它的体系。解放以来，我的意见遭受过很多压抑和歧视。1955年由于党号召在科学范围内展开自由讨论，我向领导提出自己的意见，这些意见转到中国语文社，发表在“中国语文”1956年第一期。中国语文社曾组织了二十多人来批判和澄清我的论点。后来，陈梦家先生说中国语文社曾派人约他批判，说是“政治任务”。别的朋友说，外省大学，接到我的文章的打印本，要求批判。因此，陈先生曾劝我，“这是政策，不要争论了。”“百家争鸣”的方针提出后，中国语文社约我笔谈，我认为“应该容许争论。如果一有不同意见就加以当头棒喝，那就更噤若寒蝉，万事大吉了。”但“中国语文”的社论除了表示忠诚拥护并决心贯彻“百家争鸣”的政策外，还提出了一些清规戒律，例如说：“引经据典、脱离实际的教条主义，或者不敢面对现实，企图引用权威的言论，为自己的不正确的见解辩护的做法，都是对于争鸣的进展没有好处的。”又说：“绝大多数同意做出临时结论的时候，少数人可以放弃或者保留自己的意见。”以及“防止敌人混进我们的队伍里，借口百家争鸣来进行反动宣传”，等等。这种瞻前顾后的态度，似乎还不能说是在决心贯彻“百家争鸣”的政策的。
    我始终认为语言学重要，文字学也重要，不应该歧视。文字固然反映语言，但不应该仅仅是反映语言。尤其是中国文字，有几千年的历史经验，蕴藏着无数的丰富的文化遗产，是每个人民习惯了的形式，是日常生活里必不可少的工具。要把它全部撇开，重起炉灶，根据语言来造文字；要摩仿外国文字，不但造单字，还得造单词，一下子要造几万乃至几十万个不同的单词，这些单词如为了避免同音，还需要分化；人民大众要从头学习几万乃至几十万个的新词；这种移山倒海的气魄是宏伟的，能否做到，是否值得去这样做，都还是要很好考虑的。
    奇怪的是用拉丁字母来拟制的“汉语拼音方案”的草案还没有经国务院批准，而在北京一些中学里已经布置学习了。对于中学生来说这不是轻而易举的。如果这种方案还有重新商讨的必要，那末，过早的推广是不是有益呢？
    文字改革是复杂的科学问题，同时也是有关国计民生，影响十分重大的政治工作，应该考虑时间、条件、历史环境和民族特点，应该从现有基础上逐渐发展，而不应该取决于一部分人的主观愿望，全部重来；应该慎重讨论，深入钻研，而不应该急于求成，草率从事。应该让大家毫无顾虑，畅所欲言，择及刍荛，而不应该只靠会议上的决定，行政上的简单命令。
      “百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，在目前贯彻得还是很不够的。应该彻底贯彻，只有彻底贯彻，才能把各式各样的思想逐渐获得统一，才能使人民大众更能认识马列主义真理。
