    World Federation of Trade Unions Asia-Australia Liaison Bureau Voices Support for the Algerian People
    Demands French Government Immediately Stop the Dirty War
    Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch: The World Federation of Trade Unions Asia-Australia Liaison Bureau today wrote to French Prime Minister Mollet, demanding that the French government immediately cease the war against Algeria and fully recognize Algeria's independence and sovereignty.
    The letter stated that the Algerian people's struggle for national independence has been going on for two years.
    All of humanity, through the United Nations Charter, recognizes and agrees with this demand. In particular, the Asian and African peoples, at the Bandung Conference, put forward the same demands as the Algerian people and expressed their full support for the Algerian people's struggle.
    However, during this period, the French government has mobilized approximately 600,000 troops in an attempt to suppress the Algerian people's struggle and has taken inhumane measures against people from all walks of life in Algeria. Tens of thousands of individuals, regardless of ethnicity or political opinion, have been arrested and placed in concentration camps. Thousands of progressive patriots and trade union leaders have been subjected to cruel persecution.
    In view of the above, the World Federation of Trade Unions Asia-Australia Liaison Bureau lodges a serious protest with the French government and demands:
    (1) Immediately cease the war and fully recognize Algeria's independence and the sovereignty of the Algerian people.
    (2) Immediately release the arrested Algerian trade union leaders and members, as well as all patriotic people.
    (3) Restore basic human rights, trade union rights, and democratic freedoms in Algeria.
    On the same day, the World Federation of Trade Unions Asia-Australia Liaison Bureau sent a telegram to the Algerian trade unions, supporting the just struggle of the Algerian workers and people.
    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 9th dispatch: Arab League Secretary-General Hassouna appealed on the 8th to charitable relief organizations around the world, requesting aid for the victims of the brutal French military actions in Algeria.

    世界工联亚澳联络局声援阿尔及利亚人民
    要求法国政府立即停止肮脏战争
    据新华社9日讯　世界工联亚澳联络局今天写信给法国总理摩勒，要求法国政府立即停止对阿尔及利亚的战争并完全承认阿尔及利亚的独立和主权。
    信中说，阿尔及利亚人民要求民族独立的斗争已进行两年。
    全世界的人类通过联合国宪章承认和同意这个要求。特别是亚非人民，他们在万隆会议上提出了与阿尔及利亚人民一样的要求，并且表示完全支持阿尔及利亚人民的斗争。
    但在这个时期，法国政府却动员了约六十万兵力企图镇压阿尔及利亚人民的斗争并对阿尔及利亚各界人民采取惨无人道的措施。数万个人，不分民族和政治见解，被捕入集中营。数千名进步爱国人士和工会领袖遭到残酷的迫害。
    鉴于上述情况，世界工联亚澳联络局向法国政府提出严重抗议并要求：
    （一）立即停止战争并完全承认阿尔及利亚的独立及阿尔及利亚人民的主权。
    （二）立即释放被捕的阿尔及利亚工会领袖和会员及全体爱国人民。
    （三）在阿尔及利亚恢复基本人权、工会权利和民主自由。
    同一天，世界工联亚澳联络局致电阿尔及利亚工会，支援阿尔及利亚工人和人民的正义斗争。
    据新华社开罗9日电　阿拉伯联盟秘书长哈苏纳8日向世界的各慈善救济组织呼吁，请求救济阿尔及利亚遭受法国残暴军事行动的受难者。
