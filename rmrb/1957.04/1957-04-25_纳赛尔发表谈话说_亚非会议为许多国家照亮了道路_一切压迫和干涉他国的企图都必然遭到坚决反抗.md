    Nasser Says Afro-Asian Conference Illuminated the Path for Many Countries
    All Attempts at Oppression and Interference in Other Countries Are Bound to Meet with Resolute Resistance
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 24th: Egyptian President Nasser, on the second anniversary of the Afro-Asian Conference, told a "Pravda" reporter that the Bandung spirit powerfully guides the basic trends of international development.
    "Pravda" published Nasser's remarks today, in which he discussed the major achievements and significance of the conference.
    Nasser pointed out that the great forces liberated from oppression converged in Bandung. These forces formed a strong united front, illuminating the path for different societies and many countries around the world with the light of hope.
    Nasser said that the first achievement of the conference was that the participating countries unanimously agreed to implement a common policy. They declared that peace can only be obtained through mutual understanding and sincere efforts for peaceful coexistence, and not through military treaties, military blocs, or military bases. He pointed out that the fact that Asian and African countries in the United Nations have become a latent force is also directly related to the achievements of the conference.
    Nasser said that the second achievement of the conference was that the conference pointed out the path it should take to each participating country. He said that these countries have learned to determine the political line that can guarantee their security and independence, and prevent them from being drawn into disputes that have nothing to do with them. Now, these countries are once again convinced that they can choose their own policies and reject anyone's dictates.
    Nasser said that the third point is that the Bandung Conference showed countries that did not participate in the conference a concrete example of taking a sincere step forward in the international arena.
    He said that, in addition, the Bandung Conference embodies the changes of great significance taking place in the world. The great powers cannot fail to see that all attempts to establish rule, carry out oppression, and interfere are bound to meet with large-scale resolute resistance. He also said that for many Asian and African nations, the Bandung Conference was a clear signal that the bell of freedom had rung, and it planted new hope in the hearts of the people struggling against tyranny and oppression.
    Nasser finally said that the participating countries of the Bandung Conference have achieved unity, which is a true unity woven from past experiences, the current environment, and hopes for the future.

    纳赛尔发表谈话说
    亚非会议为许多国家照亮了道路
    一切压迫和干涉他国的企图都必然遭到坚决反抗
    新华社莫斯科24日电　埃及总统纳赛尔在亚非会议二周年的时候向“真理报”记者发表谈话说，万隆精神有力地指导着国际发展的基本趋向。
    “真理报”在今天刊载了纳赛尔的谈话，纳赛尔在这篇谈话中论述了这个会议的重大成就和意义。
    纳赛尔指出，从压迫下解放出来的伟大力量在万隆汇聚了。这些力量结成一条坚强的统一阵线，用希望的光芒为全世界的不同社会和许多国家照亮了道路。
    纳赛尔说，会议的第一个成就就是与会国一致同意执行一个共同的政策。它们宣布，只有经过相互了解和真诚地为和平共处而努力才能获得和平，用军事条约、军事集团或军事基地的方法是得不到和平的。他指出，联合国中的亚非国家成为一股潜在的力量也同会议的成就直接有关。
    纳赛尔说，会议的第二个成就是会议向每个与会国指出了它应走的道路。他说，这些国家学会了确定能保障它们的安全和独立，并且防止被卷入同它们无关的纷争的政治路线。现在，这些国家再次相信，它们能够选择自己的政策和拒绝任何人的指使。
    纳赛尔说，第三点是万隆会议向没有参加会议的国家显示出在国际范围内向前走出诚恳的一步的具体范例。
    他说，此外，万隆会议体现了世界上发生的巨大意义的改变。大国不能不看到，想建立统治、进行压迫和干涉的一切企图都必然要碰到大规模的坚决反抗。他又说，对于亚非许多民族来说，万隆会议是自由钟声响了的明显信号，在为反对暴政和压迫而进行斗争的人民的心里种下了新的希望。
    纳赛尔最后说，万隆会议的参加国达到了团结一致，这是由过去的经历、目前的环境和对未来的希望所交织成的真正的团结。
