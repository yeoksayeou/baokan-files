    Reading "The New Crisis of Literary Sketches"
    Jiao Yongfu
    After reading Comrade Hui Chun's "The New Crisis of Literary Sketches" published in the People's Daily on April 11th, I have a few words to say.
    I think, rather than saying that literary sketches (essays) are facing a new crisis, it would be more accurate to say they are facing a new task. Because first, although literary sketches are a product of the democratic revolution and ideological revolution, since they are defenders of truth, they should live forever in the struggle for truth, and there is no question of whether they should exist or be abolished. Second, the people's need for literary sketches is no less than it was in the past. Contradictions still exist among the people, and these contradictions need to be resolved through struggle, and literary sketches are one of the weapons of that struggle. Third, even if some people are not very happy about literary sketches, no one dares to openly oppose them; as for those who whisper and criticize behind their backs, they are mostly people who have some connection with literary sketches: it is not surprising that those who have been pricked or injured come out and complain. Fourth, I think the most important thing is that since the second half of last year, the creation of literary sketches has become increasingly active, and the ranks of authors have also grown.
    Of course, there are some problems, some of which Comrade Hui Chun mentioned. But taken together, it is nothing more than this: in this new era, how to make literary sketches, which are specifically designed to kill the enemy, correctly deal with the internal contradictions of the people; this is indeed an unresolved problem. But is this limited to the scope of literary sketches? Therefore, I don't think we can conclude that literary sketches are facing a new crisis.
    In the era of the struggle between the enemy and us, the contradictions between the enemy and us were clearly defined, and it was relatively easy to see them. Moreover, some authors "because they came from the old camp, saw the situation more clearly, and were able to strike back and kill the strong enemy." (Lu Xun: "Written After 'Grave'") Although, the masters wanted to turn it into a "small decoration," and the Kuomintang's hired writers tried their best to exclude literary sketches, not considering them to be orthodox literary works, and the secret service agencies captured literary sketch writers; but literary sketches persisted after all, and under the high pressure of the Kuomintang reactionary rule, they fought a bloody path with the readers and created brilliant achievements.
    However, now, just as Mr. Lu Xun once pointed out: "Following that, it should be different. Unless one is a born saint, accumulated habits cannot be completely eliminated at once, but there must be a new atmosphere." Although this is only aimed at writing methods, its significance is far more than writing methods. However, this does not mean making literary sketches less sharp, turning pungency into gentleness, changing from lively to dull, or transforming a fighting weapon into something for admiring spirituality. On the contrary, the sharpness of the battle cannot be weakened. Because in that case, the life of literary sketches would probably come to an end.
    It is necessary to "be relevant to the present, and be lively, vigorous, beneficial, and also move people's emotions," and to grasp the sense of proportion, praise and criticism appropriately, and be just right. It goes without saying that this requires a high level. It should also be required that a sharp weapon can kill the enemy, but if used improperly, it can also injure oneself.
    However, how many truly cultivated authors do we have? I'm afraid we can't count them in the hundreds, right? Therefore, I think: if there is a crisis today, this crisis is not primarily objective, but mainly subjective on the part of the author. Just as people with weak stomachs cannot eat hard things, authors without considerable cultivation cannot easily use this "dagger." Even if they use it once in a while, they can't make three or two moves without injuring a friend or hurting themselves. Therefore, the issue of the cultivation of literary sketch writers has always been highly valued. For example, making literary sketch writers have a firm stand, clear love and hate, extensive knowledge, and superb skills, etc.
    Some people say: "Today, if Lu Xun were still alive, he would also use his essays to deal well with the internal contradictions of the people." This is an extremely pertinent and insightful view. Why? Mr. Lu Xun was erudite, while we are shallow. Therefore, I think: making efforts to improve the cultivation of literary sketch writers and training a few promising authors is an extremely important thing.
    But this training and cultivation must be done in creative practice, learning and writing at the same time, writing and learning at the same time. In the beginning, you are bound to make mistakes or even run into walls, but "mistakes are often the forerunners of correctness." As long as you are good at learning, you can improve. Without a few solid authors, shouting "crisis" is of no avail.
    At the same time, we must also appeal to all parties to understand the "dilemma" of literary sketches and understand the characteristics of literary sketches. Literary sketches are at most a "dagger." Just like land reclamation, a sickle can only cut grass, and as for cultivation, that is a matter for a tractor. There is no need to force it to do things beyond its capabilities.

### 读“小品文的新危机”

    读“小品文的新危机”
    焦勇夫
    读了4月11日人民日报发表的回春同志的“小品文的新危机”，我要说几句话。
    我想，如果说小品文（杂文）面临着一种新的危机，倒不如说面临着一个新的课题更为确切。因为第一，小品文虽然是萌芽于民主革命和思想革命的产物，但它既是真理的维护者，就应该与真理的战斗永生，并不发生什么存废的问题。第二，人民需要小品文也并不减于当年。人民内部还存在着矛盾，这矛盾要靠斗争解决，而小品文正是斗争的武器之一。第三，纵使有些人不大高兴小品文，却不见有谁敢于公开出来反对它；至于在背后嘁嘁嚓嚓数黑论黄的，也大抵是跟小品文有些瓜葛的人：被刺被伤者出来叫一下，正是不足为怪的。第四，我以为最重要的是：从去年下半年以来，小品文的创作是日见其活跃，作者的队伍也是日见其壮大的。
    当然也存在着一些问题，回春同志所举述的一些便都是。但集中起来看，也不过是：在这个新的时代中，如何使专以制敌于死命的小品文，正确对待人民的内部矛盾；这，确实是一个未曾解决的问题。但这又何止于小品文的范围呢？所以，我以为还不能以此就断定说小品文面临了新的危机。
    在敌我斗争的年代，是敌我的矛盾，彼此之间壁垒分明，比较容易看得出来，并且有些作者“因为从旧垒中来，情形看得较为分明，反戈一击，易制强敌的死命。”（鲁迅：“写在‘坟’后面”）虽然，老爷们想把他变为“小摆设”，国民党御用文人也极力排斥小品文，不算作文坛正品，特务机关捕捉小品文作者；但小品文毕竟是坚持了下来，并且在国民党反动统治的高压下，同读者一道杀出了一条生路，创造了光辉的业绩。
    但是，到了现在，正如同鲁迅先生曾指出过的：“跟着起来便该不同了，倘非天纵之圣，积习当然也不能顿然荡除，但总得更有新气象。”这虽然只是针对写作方法而言，但其意义的深远，当不止于写作方法的罢。然而，这绝不是意味着使小品文变锋利为钝滞，转辛辣为雍容，由活泼而呆板，从战斗的利器一变而为赏玩性灵的东西。恰巧相反，战斗的锐气是不能减弱的。因为那样一来，小品文的生命怕也就完结了。
    既要“和现在的切帖，而且生动，泼刺，有益，而且也能移人情”，又要掌握住分寸，毁誉得当，恰到好处，这要求之高是不必多说的了。也应当如此要求：锋利的武器固然可以制敌于死命，但用的不得当也会误伤了自己的。
    可是，我们真正有修养的作者有多少呢：怕是不能以百计的吧？因此，我认为：假如说今天有危机的话，这危机首先不在于客观，主要的倒是在作者的主观上。正如胃弱的人不能吃硬东西一样，没有相当修养的作者，也是不能轻易使用这“匕首”的。纵使偶一用之，耍不了三招两式，不是使朋友受伤，便是使自己破皮的。所以，关于小品文作者的修养问题，历来就非常的被重视。例如使小品文作者具有坚定的立场，分明的爱憎，渊博的知识，精湛的技巧等等。
    有人说：“今天，鲁迅如果还活着，他也会用他的杂文很好地对待人民内部矛盾的。”这是极其中肯的有识之见。为什么？鲁迅先生渊博，而我们则浅薄。所以，我认为：努力提高小品文作者的修养，造就出几个有出息的作者，倒是极其切要的事情。
    但这造就和培养必须是在创作实践中，一面学，一面写，一面写，一面学。起初是说不定要犯错误甚至是碰壁的，但是，“错误常常是正确的先导”，只要善于学习，就可以提高。没有几个坚实的作者，空喊“危机”是无补于事的。
    同时，也要吁请各方面谅解小品文的“苦衷”，了解小品文的特性。小品文充其量也不过是一把“匕首”，恰如垦荒，镰刀是只能割草的，至于耕耘，那是拖拉机的事。正不必强要它来作力所不及的事。
