    Chinese Fish Species Airlifted to Rangoon

    (Our dispatch) The batch of fish species presented to Burma by Premier Zhou Enlai during his visit last year has arrived in Rangoon. Before departure, this batch of fish species underwent a period of careful feeding at the Wuhan Lijiaqiao Aquaculture Farm and the Wuhan East Lake Aquaculture Farm, reaching a body length of 2.5 inches. Finally, they were examined by fish disease technicians from the Institute of Hydrobiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who deemed the fish species to be robust. On the morning of April 18, a special plane airlifted them from Wuhan, via Kunming, arriving in Rangoon on the afternoon of the 19th, and have been handed over to the Burmese side by our embassy in Burma.

    These fish species are Chinese native grass carp, silver carp, and bighead carp, totaling more than 22,000. The aquatic products department specially dispatched three technicians to escort them, providing aeration, changing water, and taking care of them meticulously along the way. Although this long-distance airlift of fish species was a first for our country, the survival rate reached over 98%, a good result.

    中国鱼种空运仰光
    本报讯　周恩来总理去年访问缅甸时赠给缅甸的一批鱼种，已经运抵仰光。这批鱼种在启运前，经过武昌李家桥水产养殖场和武汉市东湖养殖场一个时期的精心喂养，体长达二点五寸；最后又由中国科学院水生生物研究所鱼病技术人员的检验，认为鱼种的体质健壮。4月18日晨，由一架专机从武汉空运，经过昆明，在19日午后抵仰光，已由我国驻缅使馆交给缅方。
    这些鱼种是我国特产的鲩、鲢、鳙，一共是二万二千多尾。水产部门特派了三名技术人员护送，一路送气、换水，细心照料。虽然这样长途空运鱼种，在我国还是第一次，但运输成活率达98％以上，成绩良好。
