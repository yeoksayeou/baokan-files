    Xi'an Colleges and Universities Strengthen Political and Ideological Education
    Students' Socialist Awareness Universally Enhanced
    (Our dispatch) Since the start of this semester, colleges and universities in Xi'an have been conducting in-depth political and ideological education for students, and the socialist ideological quality of college students is being further enhanced.
    Since the beginning of this semester, all colleges and universities have universally conducted education on inheriting and carrying forward revolutionary traditions for students through Communist Youth League member representative conferences, student representative conferences, student cadre meetings, visits to veteran revolutionaries or inviting them to give reports, visits to rural areas, and holding various thematic lectures and current affairs policy reports. Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an Medical College, and Northwest Russian College also invited Comrade Li Furen and Soviet expert N.I. Skosyreva to give reports to students on the study and life situations at Yan'an University and Soviet universities, respectively. Many schools have emphasized the education of socialist thought, standpoints, viewpoints, and methods, and organized students to study and discuss documents such as "On the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat." Xi'an Aeronautical College recently had political teachers give students several special reports on issues such as democracy, freedom, and discipline. Xi'an Medical College, Xi'an Normal University, and Xi'an Power College respectively invited Zhao Jinfeng, Director of the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture, Hui Shuchang, Secretary of the Provincial Communist Youth League Committee, and others to give reports on students' thoughts, friendship, love, and marriage issues.
    Through the above education, some vague ideas among students have begun to be clarified, the ideological style of extreme democracy, freedom, and seeking enjoyment among some people has been resisted, and the atmosphere of caring about politics, respecting teachers and loving schools, and diligence and frugality is being further formed. Many students have examined and criticized ideas such as "Having learned mathematics, physics, and chemistry, one can go anywhere in the world without fear." The past situation of students not caring about current affairs has also been reversed. Most students attach importance to political classes and current affairs study, and many classes have increased their newspaper subscriptions.
    Many students at Northwest University, Northwest Russian College, Jiaotong University, and other colleges and universities have criticized ideas that college students "should be special," look down on physical labor, and do not cherish public property. Students at Xi'an Aeronautical College have managed to save an average of three kilograms of grain per person per month, and students at Northwest Russian College have managed to save ten kilowatt-hours of electricity every night. Students at many colleges and universities generally clean classrooms and dormitories themselves, repair roads, plant trees, and beautify the campus. Students at Shaanxi Normal University, in connection with the symposium on "Dedicate Everything to the Party," many graduates also examined their ideas of not wanting to work in remote areas and realized that going to the most difficult places in the motherland is the most glorious thing.
    Study discipline in various colleges and universities has been strengthened, and the phenomenon of freedom and looseness such as being late and absent from class has been generally reduced. The atmosphere of studying diligently, helping each other, and competing in learning among students is becoming increasingly strong. Labor-defense system exercises and physical exercises have also become universally active. Now, the vast majority of students are actively striving to be a socialist young college student.

    西安各高等院校加强政治思想教育
    学生社会主义觉悟普遍提高
    本报讯　西安各高等院校深入对学生进行政治思想教育，大学生中的社会主义思想品质正在进一步提高。
    本学期开学以来，各院校普遍通过团员代表大会、学生代表会议、学生干部会，访问革命老前辈或请他们作报告，访问农村，以及举办各种专题讲座、时事政策报告等，向学生进行继承和发扬革命传统的教育。陕西师范学院、西安医学院和西北俄专等院校还分别邀请了李敷仁同志和苏联专家尼·依·斯科赛列娃，向学生作了关于延安大学和苏联大学的学习生活情况的报告。许多学校重视了社会主义思想、立场和观点、方法的教育，组织学生学习、讨论了“再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”等文件。西安航空学院最近还由政治课教师向学生作了几次有关民主、自由、纪律等问题的专题报告。西安医学院、西安师范学院和西安动力学院等院校，曾分别邀请了陕西省农业厅厅长赵锦峰、团省委书记惠庶昌等，就学生思想、友谊、恋爱和婚姻问题作了报告。
    通过上述教育，在学生中的一些模糊思想已开始澄清，部分人的极端民主自由、贪图享受的思想作风受到了抵制，关心政治、尊师爱校、勤俭朴素的风尚正在进一步形成。不少学生检查批判了“学会数理化，走遍天下都不怕”等思想。过去学生中不关心时事的情况也已经得到扭转。大多数学生都重视了政治课和时事学习，许多班级的学生都增订了报纸。
    西北大学、西北俄专、交通大学等院校不少学生都批判了认为大学生“应该特殊”、轻视体力劳动、不爱惜公物等思想。西安航空学院学生做到了每人每月平均节约三斤粮食，西北俄专学生作到了每晚节约十度电。不少院校的学生普遍自己动手打扫教室和宿舍的环境卫生，自己修路、种树，美化校园。陕西师范学院学生结合“把一切献给党”的座谈，不少毕业生还检查了自己不愿到边远地区去工作的思想，认识到到祖国最艰苦的地方去才是最光荣的。
    各院校的学习纪律加强了，迟到、旷课等自由散漫现象普遍减少了，学生中钻研学习、团结互助和比学习的风气日益浓厚。劳卫制锻炼和体育锻炼也普遍活跃起来了。现在，绝大多数学生都积极地为争取作一个社会主义的青年大学生而努力。　（孔祥光）
