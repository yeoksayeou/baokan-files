Title: Two Unnecessary Concerns

Of the concerns regarding the "Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," according to my personal impression, there seem to be the following two types: one is about oneself, that is, the fear that if one speaks according to one's own ideas now, these words may be used as materials for self-criticism in the future, so one dares not speak freely now; the other is about others, that is, the fear that if the "Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" is allowed, then soon the leading ideology—dialectical materialism—will lose its leading position, creating a situation of confusing opinions and public anxiety, and therefore hoping to restrict the contention, or even stop the contention.

The first concern is unnecessary. Since everyone is allowed to express their own opinions, there is absolutely no reason to use it as material for personal self-criticism. Moreover, in the past, the main things to be criticized were personal thoughts that were informally exposed or unwilling to be exposed. Now that a person expresses his opinion in an article, he will definitely not deny that this is his thought. If others think it is wrong, they can use arguments to refute him, without using the method of criticism, and without needing this method. Moreover, academic and ideological issues should be discussed calmly and meticulously, not resolved through struggle sessions; so there is no need to be afraid of being struggled against in the future and therefore not "speak out" now. After liberation, some people made self-criticisms of articles published before liberation, which is another matter and cannot be confused with the principle of "Hundred Schools of Thought Contend."

The second concern is also excessive. Thought is an activity inside the human brain and cannot be prohibited. If you forbid people to speak, it does not mean that this thought will disappear. There is an old Chinese saying, "What the eye doesn't see, the heart doesn't grieve over," which means that a person thinks that something is dirty, but as long as he hasn't seen it himself, it is considered clean. This self-deceiving method is not worthwhile. Moreover, what people want to say is not necessarily something dirty, it may be something fresh and good, so if you don't let people take it out, you are even more at a disadvantage. Even if it is something dirty, or even a toxic bacteria, it is better to expose it and let the power of sunlight disinfect it than to let it hide in a dark corner and grow day by day. Everyone knows that the correct principles are indestructible. We want to let the public see that the more people want to overthrow it, the stronger it becomes, and thus realize that it is an absolutely true principle. Therefore, correct thought can never lose its leading position. On the other hand, wrong ideas will be naturally eliminated through everyone's discussion and criticism, and there is absolutely no need to prohibit people from publishing them from the beginning. Moreover, without the discussion of the majority, the reasons why wrong ideas are wrong will not be understood. Needless to say, this kind of knowledge of knowing that it is wrong but not knowing why it is wrong is not very useful.

Perhaps some people will say, some thoughts are clearly wrong, why still let them "speak out"? My personal opinion is that thought "contention" is different from action. The medium of contention is language and writing, and it will not immediately have practical results. If others hear these words and read these texts, and disagree, they can criticize and refute them. For example, if someone draws a knife and kills someone due to a quarrel, this should of course be stopped by force. But if this person only says that he can draw a knife and kill someone when encountering a verbal dispute, we still have time to persuade him and make him realize that his thinking is wrong. Not prohibiting him from saying this will not necessarily harm human life (this example is just an assumption, of course no one advocates drawing a knife and killing someone in a verbal dispute). From another point of view, not allowing people to express wrong ideas, so that he cannot get criticism and correction from others, may instead cause actual damage once it is developed into action.

In short, individuals can express whatever opinions they want, and at most, if this opinion is wrong, it will be criticized by others, that's all; this is originally beneficial and harmless to both people. At the same time, people should be allowed to express their opinions as much as possible—expressing opinions is not the same as implementing opinions, and it should not be regarded as a terrible effect that will cause danger.

    两种不必要的顾虑
    唐钺
    关于“百家争鸣”的顾虑之中，据我个人的印象，似乎有以下两种：一种是对自己的，就是怕现在照自己的意思说话，这些话将来可能被充作自我检讨的材料，因此现在不敢畅所欲言；一种是对别人的，就是怕如果让“百家争鸣”，那么，不久，领导的思想——辩证唯物主义思想，将失却领导的地位，造成群言淆乱，人心惶惑的状况，因此希望对争鸣加以限制，甚至要停止争鸣。
    第一种顾虑是不必要的。既然让大家各人表示自己的意见，断无又来把它作为个人应该作检讨的材料的道理，并且过去要检讨的，主要是个人自己非正式地暴露或不愿暴露的思想。现在一个人既然自己作文章表示他的意见，他断不会不承认这是他的思想。别人认为不对，尽可以用论证来驳他，用不上检讨这个办法，也用不着这个办法。并且关于学术思想的问题，本来就是要从容地细致地讨论的，不是用斗争会的方式可以解决的；所以用不着怕将来被斗争而现在不“鸣”。解放后有些人对解放前所发表的文章作了自我检讨，这是另一回事，不能与“百家争鸣”的方针混为一谈。
    第二种顾虑，也是过虑。思想是人脑内部的活动，是无法禁止的。你禁止人说话，并不是这种思想就消灭了。中国有句老话说“眼不见为净”，就是说一个人以为污浊的东西，只要他本人没看见，就算干净。这种自己骗自己的办法是不上算的。而况人家要说的东西不一定是污浊的东西，可能是新鲜的好的东西，那么，你不让人拿出来，就更是自己吃亏了。就是污浊的东西，甚至是毒菌，与其让它藏在黑暗的角落，日日滋长，倒不如让它暴露出来，让太阳光的力量去消毒的好。大家都知道正确的道理是颠扑不破的。我们正要让大众看见，越有人想颠扑它，它越坚强，因而觉悟到它是千真万确的道理。所以正确的思想绝不可能失却领导的地位。另一方面，错误的思想，经过大家的讨论批评，会被自然淘汰去，决无须开头就禁止人发表。并且错误的思想，没经过多数人的讨论，它所以错误的理由，是不会弄得明白的。用不着说，这种知其误而不知其所以误的知识，是没有多大用处的。
    也许有人会说，有些思想，分明是错误的，为什么还让它“鸣”出来呢？我个人的意思以为思想“争鸣”与行动不同。争鸣的媒介是语言文字，并不是会立刻发生实际的结果的。别人听了这些语言，看了这些文字，假如不同意，可以加以批评辩驳。比方说，万一有人因口角争论而提刀杀人，这当然要用强力制止。但假如这个人只是说遇着口头争论时可以提刀杀人，我们还可以有时间说服他，使他觉悟他这样想是错误的。不禁止他说这个话，并不至就损害人命（这个例是随便假定，当然不会有人主张口头争论时可以提刀杀人）。从另一方面看，倒是不让人说出错误的思想，因而他得不到别人的批评纠正，反而有可能一旦发为行动而造成实际损害。
    总之，个人要发表什么意见，尽管发表，充其量不过是，如果这个意见是错误的，会被别人批驳，罢了；这本来对人对己都是有益无害的事。同时应该让人家尽量发表意见——发表意见并不等于实行意见，不必认为是会发生危险的可怕的效果的。
