Look at Hohhot, the Capital of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Today
Rong Xiang, Deputy Mayor of Hohhot

When people in the motherland, especially those in the vast areas south of the Great Wall, hear the word "Sai Bei" (north of the border), they invariably tend to use bleak words such as desolate, deserted, barren, and infertile to describe it and imagine it. In fact, the main reason for this deep-rooted negative impression of the border areas among the people of the motherland lies not in the natural conditions of the border region itself, but entirely because, for more than two thousand years, Chinese scholars of literature and history have recorded unreliable rumors in historical records and expressed them in poetry. One voice leads to a hundred echoes, becoming canonical. Sima Qian was the greatest historian of the Han Dynasty. Although he traveled to famous mountains and rivers to enrich his writings, he never personally visited the border region. Therefore, his "Records of the Grand Historian: Biography of the Xiongnu" could not realistically depict the mountains and rivers there, at best describing it as the residence of an unlovable northern barbarian. From then on, literary writers of later generations intensified their subjective imagination, such as "Vast and boundless plains, no people in sight," "Snow covers the ankles, frost freezes the beard," "North wind sweeps the ground, white grass breaks, in the eighth month of the Tartar sky, snow flies," "Wanting to chase the light cavalry, heavy snow fills the bow and knife." They truly exhausted all means and searched all words to describe this vast and precious land north of the Great Wall as an uninhabitable area, only then feeling at ease. Imagine, how could the people of China not regard the border region as a daunting path in life under such intimidating and endless propaganda?

However, when we look at this issue from the grand perspective of today's socialist motherland, we need not complain about the inaccuracy of the writings of past scholars, nor need we complain about the credulity of our ancestors, because this was a phenomenon that inevitably arose in China's feudal ruling era, and it is not at all surprising. The reason for this, in summary, is: when foreign tribes occupy the land, it is not worth a penny; when imperial favor is bestowed, even the barren wilderness becomes the most fertile land. That's all. Since the people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia region achieved a complete revolutionary victory under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, not only have political systems and production relations undergone rapid changes, but even natural conditions such as mountains, rivers, wetlands, soil, and climate have quickly demonstrated their unparalleled value. It is as if a spring thunder awakens all dormant creatures, and the appearance of nature rushes forward into the bright and splendid future. Urban construction is particularly prominent. In the vast grassland areas, many industrial, mining, forestry, and pastoral center cities have emerged from scratch like bamboo shoots after a rain; in the original ancient border areas, several leading political, economic, and cultural cities have been transformed from old to new, as if rejuvenated. This fully proves that if a place or a nation cannot overthrow the oppression and conservatism of the feudal ruling class, it will not only be in a long-term state of gloom and desolation but will inevitably gradually wither and decline. Only after the broad masses of working people themselves have grasped political power can the fate of a place or a nation be reborn. Therefore, we believe that the revolutionary victory won by the Chinese Communist Party in leading the Chinese people has indeed demonstrated incomparably great achievements throughout the country, but in the case of historically backward minority areas, we believe that its speed of development and amount of construction are indeed more astonishing than in the advanced areas. This is a very clear education and a very profound reminder for the people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

Today, the Inner Mongolia region is neither a remote area "with no people in sight" nor a "Tartar sky with snow flying in the eighth month," but a "screen of the motherland" with thousands of villages and beautiful mountains and rivers. The emerging undertakings and urban construction here are like stars in the sky, and we cannot enumerate them all. In order to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, we intend to briefly introduce the most representative capital of the Autonomous Region—Hohhot—so that readers can know about its changes in recent years, which is also quite meaningful.

Hohhot is the original name of the city when it was built by the Mongols. It is translated into Chinese as Qingcheng or the Blue City. Some individuals also translate it as the Azure City using a synonym, but the Tumet Mongols who built the city have always only translated it as Qing and not as Lan, because the word Qing contains many meanings of youthful vitality, while the word Lan has a hint of turning from Qing to Cang (pale blue). Therefore, the Tumet Mongols do not like to hear others call it the Azure City. This city was rebuilt by Altan Khan's concubine, San Niangzi, based on Altan Khan's old camp in the 14th year of the Wanli reign of the Ming Dynasty (1586 AD). The Han people called it "San Niangzi City," and the Ming Dynasty bestowed the name "Guihua City." This happened four years after Altan Khan's death, and it is incorrect for the Ming Dynasty histories to record it as happening when "Altan" was conferred the title of King.

Since the Ming Dynasty insisted on calling this city "Guihua," this name, which insulted the Mongol ethnic group, continued to be used in the official and private documents of the ruling class through the Qing Dynasty and the warlord separatist period after the Xinhai Revolution. However, in the Mongolian language, it was always called Hohhot and never called "Guihua City." This shows that the antagonism between the ruling class and the minority ethnic groups existed for more than 360 years (1586-1954) in the name of a city alone. After liberation, the Government Administration Council issued a circular instructing all parts of the country to abolish all old names that insulted minority ethnic groups. On April 25, 1954, the people of Hohhot also decided to abolish the old name "Gui-Sui City," which combined the names "Guihua" and "Suiyuan," and restored the original city name of the Mongolian ethnic group—Hohhot. When this decision was officially announced, people of all ethnic groups in the city were overjoyed and supported it, believing that this was a further manifestation of strengthening ethnic unity.

Judging from the history of this city, it has been a city of mixed ethnic groups for many years. However, during the more than 200 years of the Qing Dynasty's rule, the political system created a serious phenomenon of ethnic antagonism. That is, there were three political systems within the city: first, the Tusi administrative system of the Tumet Mongols, which only managed the Mongol ethnic group and did not concern itself with other ethnic groups; second, the military administrative system of the Manchu Eight Banners, which only managed the Manchu people and did not concern itself with other ethnic groups; third, the Gui-Sui Military Defense Circuit administrative system under the jurisdiction of the Shanxi Provincial Administration Commission, which only managed the Han people and did not concern itself with other ethnic groups. The remaining Hui people became residents who were uncared for or discriminated against by all three systems. Under such an artificial division and antagonistic situation, ethnic relations were of course mutually mocking and mutually exclusive. How could one talk about close unity and being as close as brothers?

The above-mentioned phenomenon was almost considered by people in the old society to be a natural "chronic disease" brought by each ethnic group since ancient times, and it was impossible to cure it at all. Therefore, no one thought about treating it, but only unconsciously deepened the estrangement. Before liberation, many people heard that the Communist Party had a policy of uniting all ethnic groups in the country and thought that this was a political propaganda slogan. They expressed doubts about whether it could actually be achieved. However, soon after Hohhot was liberated, the original Provincial Ethnic Affairs Committee actively launched activities. First, a Hui Autonomous Region was established in the city. Then, outstanding upper-class figures from various ethnic groups were selected as representatives in the people's representative conferences at the provincial and municipal levels. In this way, the broad masses of people of all ethnic groups began to believe that the Communist Party's ethnic policy was to be gradually and conscientiously implemented. Through a series of democratic movements over the past few years, the socialist consciousness of the people of all ethnic groups and the sincere unity of fraternal ethnic groups have been improved and consolidated. Now, more than 300,000 residents of all ethnic groups in the city are marching forward with a strong and united spirit behind the banner of the Party and the government to build socialism. From these experiences, we can draw the following conclusion: in areas of mixed ethnic groups, ethnic unity is a prerequisite for doing a good job in all tasks.

The various new achievements of Hohhot since liberation are difficult to describe in detail. We will only talk about them in a comprehensive way, pointing out an outline. For example, at the beginning of liberation, the city had a total of more than 120,000 residents; a jurisdiction area of 75 square kilometers; no new-style buildings; no cement roads; no universities; no modern theaters; no libraries; no parks; in short, modern cities should have facilities such as stadiums, hotels, clubs, cultural centers, shopping malls, etc. that were either completely non-existent or so rudimentary that they were laughable. Even the Kuomintang's "Suiyuan Provincial Government" did not have a conference room that could accommodate 200 people. Other things can be imagined. Now our city of Hohhot has a population of 300,000; a jurisdiction area of 2,450 square kilometers; if you want to ask how many new-style buildings there are? Please climb the main building of the People's Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and look around! It is truly endless, and no one can count how many buildings there are. As for roads, there are not only cement and gravel roads, but also more than one new asphalt road. Those things that were originally missing now all exist. Factories, from the original nine dilapidated factories with small houses, outdated equipment, and few employees, after a series of intensive efforts such as rectification, merger, new construction, and expansion, have now grown year by year to 41 factories of four types of ownership: state-owned, local state-owned, cooperative-owned, and joint state-private. Several large-scale factories that are planned to be built in the future according to the overall urban plan are not included. The growing ranks of workers of all ethnic groups, the increasing number of students of all ethnic groups, the solution of the employment problem of citizens, and the improvement of the cultural and technical skills of employees have all become brilliant achievements unanimously praised by the 300,000 residents of the city. We can cite just one example to get a general idea of the situation in the city: more than 80% of the street activities and literacy work of the 49 neighborhood committees in the three districts in the city center are carried out by housewives and women who have graduated from civil schools, elementary schools, and junior high schools. This on the one hand reflects male employment, and on the other hand, it is a manifestation of the broad masses of women striving for progress and actively serving socialism.

Who can not be excited about this unprecedented and magnificent cause of turning a 370-year-old ancient city into an ethnic paradise full of vitality and radiating light, and who can not contribute their strength to completing this cause ahead of schedule? Therefore, it is entirely understandable that the people of Hohhot today, regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, or sector, can follow the direction of the Party and the government and advance enthusiastically.

We also know that the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has just reached its tenth anniversary, and from the perspective of the meaning of life, it is still in its infancy. Although the victory of the revolution in the Inner Mongolia region has been achieved under the vigorous cultivation, support, and leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the foundation is weak; talents and knowledge are limited; and various production undertakings are backward.

Our region's autonomy is only one step ahead of other fraternal ethnic regions, just one step. There is nothing to be complacent about here. Therefore, we hope that the people of all ethnic groups and all sectors in our region will guard against arrogance and complacency, humbly learn from advanced fraternal ethnic groups, and work diligently and frugally and down-to-earth to build the great cause of socialism. Celebrating the tenth anniversary of our autonomous region with this spirit is in line with the expectations of the Chinese Communist Party and the broad masses of people for the autonomous region.

    请看今日内蒙古自治区首府—呼和浩特
    呼和浩特市副市长　荣祥
    祖国人民特别是长城线以南广大地区的人民，一听到“塞北”这个字眼儿，总是不期然而然地要用荒凉、冷落、贫瘠、不毛等极衰飒的词汇去形容它、去推想它。其实，给祖国人民造成这种根深蒂固的消极印象的主要原因，并不在于塞外地区自然条件的本身，而是完全由于二千余年以来，中国的文史学者们把不确实的传闻，著之史籍，形之诗歌，一唱百和，成为典要所引起的。司马迁是汉代最伟大的史家，他虽曾游览名山大川以充实其文章，但也没有亲自到过塞北，所以他所著“史记匈奴列传”就不能把这里的山川形势如实地描绘出来，充其量也不过是一个不甚可爱的北狄所居之地而已。从这以后，历代的文学作家就更变本加厉地给以主观想像的渲染，什么“浩浩乎平沙无垠，夐不见人”啦，什么“积雪没胫，坚冰在须”啦，什么“北风卷地白草折，胡天八月即飞雪”啦，什么“欲将轻骑逐，大雪满弓刀”啦，真是想尽方法，搜尽词藻，要把长城以北这片辽阔的宝地形容成非人所居之区，才算心安。请想，中国各地人民在这种恐吓性的无休止宣传之下，怎能不把塞外视作人生畏途呢。
    可是，我们从今天的社会主义祖国的伟大场面来看这个问题，那就既不必抱怨历代学者们的文不真实，也更不必抱怨历代先民们的轻信谣传，因为这是我国在封建统治时代必然产生的现象，是丝毫也不足为奇的。其中道理，总括起来说，就是：异族蟠踞，便不值一钱；皇威如被，即龙荒最壤。如此而已。自内蒙古地区各族人民在中国共产党领导下取得彻底的革命胜利之后，不仅政治制度，生产关系起了迅速的变化，甚至山河原湿、土壤气候等自然条件也都很快地表现出它们的无比价值来。这仿佛是春雷一鸣，萌蛰尽发，天容物态齐向光明灿烂中竞进。尤其城市建设表现的更为突出，在广大草原地带，是从无到有，像雨后新笋似地出现了许多工、矿、林、牧业的中心城市；在原有的古边邑地区，是从旧到新，像返老还童似地改造了若干政治、经济、文化的领导城市。这就充分证明一个地方或民族如果不能推翻封建统治阶级的压迫保守，它就不仅是长期处于阴沉惨淡的境地，而且必然是日渐趋于枯萎没落的途径。只有在广大的劳动人民自己掌握了政权之后，一个地方或民族的命运也才能获得新生。因此，我们觉得中国共产党领导中国人民所赢得的革命胜利，在全国范围诚然已经表现出伟大无比的成就，但在从来落后的少数民族地区所表现的情况来看，我们就认为它的发展之快和建设之多，确比前进地区还要惊人。这对内蒙古自治区各民族人民是一个很明显的宣教，也是一个很深刻的铭记。
    内蒙古地区今天既不是“夐不见人”的异域，也不是“八月飞雪”的胡天，而是一个千村万落、山明水秀的“祖国之锦屏”。关于这里的新兴事业以及城市建设，真如繁星在天，我们是无法加以指述的。为了纪念内蒙古自治区成立十周年，我们打算把最有代表性的自治区首府——呼和浩特扼要地介绍一下，使读者知道它最近几年来的变化情况，也是颇有意义的。
    呼和浩特是蒙古人筑成这个城市时的原来名称。汉语译作青城或青色的城。也有个别人以同义词译为蓝色的城，但筑城的土默特蒙古人则从来只译作青而不译作蓝，因为青字包涵了青春、青年等许多生气充沛的意义在里边，而蓝字则有由青变苍的味道。所以土默特蒙古人是不爱听别人把它叫蓝城的。这座城是明代万历十四年（公元1586年）由阿勒坦汗（明史称他为俺答）的如夫人三娘子依阿勒坦汗的旧营垒改修的。汉民称它为“三娘子城”，明朝赐名为“归化城”。这是阿勒坦汗逝世四年以后的事情，明代诸史把它记在“俺答”封王时是错误的。
    自明代硬把这座城叫作“归化”以来，经前清到辛亥革命以后的军阀割据时期，这个侮辱蒙古族的名称一直通行于统治阶级的公私文牍里，而在蒙古语言文字中则始终叫它呼和浩特，绝不称它为“归化城”。这就说明统治阶级与少数民族之间的对立仅在一座城市的名称上就存在了三百六十余年（公元1586—1954）。解放后，政务院通令指示全国各地一律取消侮辱少数民族的各种旧称谓。呼和浩特市人民也于1954年4月25日决定废除“归化”“绥远”两城合称的“归绥市”旧名，恢复了蒙古民族本来的城名——呼和浩特。当这个决定正式宣布的时候，全市各族人民无不欢欣拥护，认为这是加强民族团结的进一步表现。
    从这座城市的历史来看，多少年来它就是一个民族杂居的城市。但在前清统治的二百多年间，却从政治制度上给它造成严重的民族对立现象。那就是：一市之内有三个政治系统，第一是土默特蒙古的土司行政系统，只管蒙古民族不问他族；第二是满洲八旗的军制行政系统，只管满民不问他族；第三是山西藩司所辖归绥兵备道行政系统，只管汉民不问他族。剩下回民，就成为三头不关心或三头受歧视的居民了。在这种人为的划分和对立情势下，民族关系当然是互相讥笑，互相排斥，更哪能谈到紧密团结，亲如兄弟呢？
    上述这种现象，在旧社会的人们看来，几乎认为是各民族本身自古带来的天然“锢疾”，根本无法治疗。因此，也就没有人想去治疗它，而只是不自觉地日益加深了隔膜。有许多人在解放前听到共产党有团结国内各民族的民族政策方针，都认为这是一种政治宣传口号，实际上能否做到，却表示怀疑。可是当呼市获得解放不久，原省属民族事务委员会即积极展开活动，首先在市内成立了回民自治区。跟着又在省、市各级人民代表会议中选拔了各民族的上层优秀人士任代表。这样一来，各族广大人民才开始相信共产党的民族政策是要逐步认真贯彻下去的。几年来经过一系列的民主运动，各族人民的社会主义觉悟和兄弟民族的真诚团结，都已得到提高与巩固。现在全市三十多万各族居民就以这种坚强一致的精神，跟在党与政府建设社会主义的大旗后面，踏着雄健步伐向前迈进。从这些经验里，我们可以得出如下的结论，就是：在民族杂居区，民族团结，是搞好各项工作的先决条件。
    呼和浩特市解放以来的各种新成就，是很难覼缕细说的。我们只用综合性的说法来谈，指出个轮廓。如解放初全市居民共有十二万多人；辖地面积七十五平方公里；没有一座新式楼房；没有一条洋灰马路；没有高等学校；没有近代剧院；没有图书馆；没有公园；总之，凡是现代城市所应该具备的如体育场、宾馆、俱乐部、文化馆、商场等不是根本没有，就是简陋到令人失笑。甚至国民党的“绥远省政府”也没有一个可容二百人的会议室。其他就可想而知了。现在我们的呼和浩特市，号称三十万人口；辖地面积二千四百五十平方公里；您要问有几幢新式楼房么？请您登内蒙古自治区人民委员会的主楼向四面望吧！真是一眼望不到边，谁也数不清究竟有几幢。至于马路，那就不仅有了洋灰的、石子的、而且最新柏油路也不止一条哩。上面所指那些原来没有的东西，今天都有了。工厂，从原来房屋狭小，设备陈旧，职工无多的九个破烂厂子，经过整顿合并，新修扩建等一系列的紧张努力，现在逐年扩大生产的包括国营、地方国营、合作社营、公私合营四种性质的工厂就已发展到四十一个。随着今后城市总体规划准备将来建设的若干大型工厂，尚不在内。各民族工人队伍的逐年壮大，各民族学生人数的逐年增加，市民就业问题的解决，职工文化技术的提高，都已成为全市三十万居民一致歌颂的辉煌成绩。我们只举一个例子就可以把全市的情况看出个大概来，那就是：市中心三个区所属四十九个居民委员会的街道活动和扫盲工作，有80％以上是家庭妇女及民校高小、初中毕业的妇女来担任的。这一方面是男子就业的反映，另一方面则是广大妇女争取进步，积极为社会主义服务的表现。
    把一个三百七十多年的古老城市，变成一个充满朝气、迸射光芒的民族乐园，谁能不为此空前伟丽的事业而兴奋，又谁能不为提前完成此事业而贡献出自己的力量呢？所以今天呼和浩特市人民不论老少男女，何族何界，都能遵循党与政府的指示方向踊跃前进，是完全可以理解的。
    我们也知道内蒙古自治区的建立刚满十年，从人生的意义来衡量，也仍然未离孩提幼稚之期。虽然在中国共产党大力培养、扶助、领导之下取得内蒙古地区革命的胜利，但家底基础是微薄的；人材知识是?陋的；各项生产事业是落后的。
    我区的自治，只是比其他兄弟民族地区先走了一步，仅仅是一步。这里边并没有什么值得自满的东西。因此，愿我区各族各界人民都戒骄戒满，虚心向各先进兄弟民族学习，更克勤克俭，足踏实地的为建设社会主义大业而努力。以此精神来庆祝我们自治区的十周年纪念，是符合于中国共产党和广大人民对自治区的期望的。（附图片）
