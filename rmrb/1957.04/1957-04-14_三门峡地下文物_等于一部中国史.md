Sanmenxia Underground Cultural Relics
Equal a History of China

The Sanmenxia urban area and its surrounding areas are extremely rich in underground cultural relics, with items from every era from the Neolithic Age to modern times, equivalent to a history of China. The copper Lücuo (a measuring instrument) made in the first year of Wang Mang's reign (Shi Jian Guo), is the smallest measuring instrument of the Wang Mang era ever discovered, providing a new basis for studying the economy of the Wang Mang era. Among the large number of artifacts unearthed from the Tang tombs, three white porcelain bottles are exceptionally exquisite, one of which seems to have a bluish glass glaze. This shows that the art of porcelain making had reached a very high level by the Tang Dynasty.

Four tombs from the Spring and Autumn period were excavated in Shangcun, and more than 200 pieces of bronzeware were unearthed. The most prominent of these are two Ge (dagger-axes) inscribed with characters such as "Ge of Crown Prince Yuan of Guo." Near this main tomb was a chariot and horse pit 29 meters long and 4 meters wide. In the excavated section of the pit, which was 8 meters long, four chariots from the Spring and Autumn period were discovered, with eight horses lying neatly beside them. The main tomb tells us the name and identity of the buried person and the location of the Guo State, and the chariots and horses also indicate that they were burial objects of the Guo State aristocracy.

The underground area of Miaodigou is mainly a Neolithic site, possibly earlier than the Banpo site in Xi'an. More than 90 ash pits and 150 tombs have been excavated. The unearthed items are from the Yangshao, Longshan, and Eastern Zhou periods. Among them, broken Yangshao pottery is the most numerous, and more than 300 complete restored artifacts have been recovered. The patterns are complex, and the red pottery is very exquisite. A Yangshao pottery stove is unlike anything seen before.

There are about 70 stone carvings in Sanmenxia, dating from the first year of the Han Dynasty (He Ping) to the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty. They are excellent historical materials for the history of Sanmenxia shipping. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    三门峡地下文物
    等于一部中国史
    三门峡市区和它的周围地区，地下文物极为丰富，从新石器时代一直到近代，各时代的东西都有，等于一部中国史。王莽始建国元年造的铜质律撮，是第一次发现的王莽时代最小的量器，为研究王莽时代的经济提供了新的根据。唐墓出土的大批器物中，有三个白瓷瓶异常精美，其中一个好像带青色的玻璃釉。这说明制瓷艺术到唐朝已经达到了很高的程度。
    在上村挖掘了四个春秋时的墓，共清理出两百多样铜器。其中最突出的有两个戈，戈上刻着“虢太子元徒戈”等字。这个主墓附近有个长二十九公尺，宽四公尺的车马坑，在已挖掘的八公尺的一段坑内，发现春秋时的四辆车，对躺着很整齐的八匹马。主墓告诉给我们葬者的名字身份和虢国的位置，车马也说明是虢国贵族的殉葬品。
    庙底沟地下主要是新石器时期的遗址，可能早于西安半坡的遗址，已发掘了九十多个灰坑和一百五十个墓葬。出土的东西，都是仰韶龙山及东周时代的。其中以仰韶时期的破碎器物为最多，已经复原成三百多件完整的复原的器物，花样复杂，其中的红陶制作很精美；一个仰韶时期的陶灶，是以前没有见过的。
    三门峡的石刻，共约七十多处，上起汉朝和平元年，下至清乾隆年间，是很好的三门峡航运史资料。　（据新华社讯）
