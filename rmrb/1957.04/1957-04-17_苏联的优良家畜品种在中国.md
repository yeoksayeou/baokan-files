    Excellent Soviet Livestock Breeds in China
    Xu Kangzu
    The Soviet Union is a country with relatively developed animal husbandry in the world. It not only possesses a large number of livestock but also has many livestock breeds with extremely high production performance. Take the "Ardennes" heavy draft horse as an example. Its weight (650-700 kilograms or more) is twice as high as that of ordinary Chinese horses, and its plowing and draft capacity is much stronger than that of ordinary Chinese horses. The Soviet "Kostroma" dairy cow can generally produce 6,000 kilograms of milk per head per year. The "Askanian" sheep can generally produce about 15 kilograms of fine wool per ram per year, which is 14 times more than the annual wool production of ordinary Chinese sheep. In other words, the wool sheared from one sheep can be woven into 21-24 meters of high-quality clothing material, enough to make seven to eight Zhongshan suits. Under good feeding management conditions, the Soviet Large White pig can grow to about 300 kilograms one year after birth.
    These many excellent Soviet livestock breeds are of great help to China's livestock improvement work. In recent years, more than 1,000 stallions and more than 3,000 breeding sheep (merino) have been imported from the Soviet Union. Among them, the "Karachaev" fur sheep is a world-famous precious breed. Its lambskin is not only very lustrous and lightweight but also has dense wool curled into beautiful waves. This breed is very valuable in the international market, but the Soviet Union generously supplied us with some.
    These excellent Soviet breeding livestock have grown and developed well in state-owned farms and ranches in China and have multiplied greatly. They have now become the core herd of excellent livestock in China.
    Since 1950, China has used these excellent breeds of male livestock to improve China's livestock. According to incomplete statistics, in recent years, the number of privately owned mares crossbred with excellent Soviet breeds has been about 300,000, and the number of privately owned ewes has been more than 1 million. The hybrid horses and hybrid sheep born after crossbreeding have much higher production performance than local horses and sheep. For example, the first-generation hybrid horses produced by crossbreeding "Ardennes" stallions with Nongan mares in Nongan County, Jilin Province, generally have a height of 138.1 cm, 7.54% higher than local horses, and a weight of 390 kilograms, 16.76% higher than local horses. The local people are very interested in this kind of hybrid horse. They say: The "Ardennes" hybrid horse is gentle, easy to work with, and strong. One hybrid horse can replace one and a half to two local horses. In the Chabei area of ​​Hebei Province, the first-generation hybrid ewes produced by crossbreeding Soviet Merino rams with local Mongolian sheep can shear 2.6 kilograms of wool per year, an increase of about 160% compared to local sheep. Second-generation hybrid rams can shear 4.92 kilograms of wool per year, an increase of more than 300% compared to local sheep, and the fineness and uniformity of the wool have also been greatly improved. Liaoning Province reports that the income from selling wool from raising a hybrid sheep is one to one and a half times higher than raising a local sheep. (Attached pictures)

    苏联的优良家畜品种在中国
    许康祖
    苏联是世界上畜牧业比较发达的国家，不但拥有数量众多的家畜，并且还有很多生产性能极高的家畜品种。以“阿尔登”重挽马来说，它的体重（650——700公斤以上）比我国一般马高一倍，它的耕挽能力比我国一般马强得多。苏联的“科斯特罗门”奶牛，一般每头每年能产奶六千公斤。“阿斯卡尼亚”绵羊，一般公羊每年能生产细毛十五公斤左右，比我国一般绵羊每年的产毛量多十四倍。这也就是说，一头羊身上剪下来的毛，可以织成二十一——二十四公尺的优良衣料，可以缝制七——八套中山装。苏联的大白猪，在良好饲养管理条件下，生后一年就可以长到三百公斤左右。
    苏联的这许多优良家畜品种，对我国的家畜改良工作有很大帮助。几年来，先后从苏联进口的种马有一千多匹，进口的种羊（绵羊）三千多头。其中的“卡拉哥儿”皮裘羊，是世界上有名的珍贵品种，它的羔羊皮，不但光彩很好、皮板轻薄，而且羊毛紧密，卷曲成美丽的波纹。这个品种在国际市场上，价值很高，可是苏联毫不吝啬的供应了我们一些。
    这些苏联优良种畜在我国各国营农场、牧场生长发育都很好，并且增殖很多，现在已经成为我国优良家畜的核心畜群。
    从1950年开始，我国利用这些优良品种的公畜来改良我国的家畜。据不完全统计，几年来，全国用苏联优良品种杂交的民有母马约有三十万匹，民有母羊约一百多万头。杂交后生下来的杂种马、杂种羊，在生产性能上都比当地的马、羊提高很多。如吉林省农安县用“阿尔登”种公马和农安母马杂交所产的第一代杂种马，一般体高138.1厘米，比当地马提高7.54％，体重三百九十公斤，比当地马提高16.76％。当地群众对这种杂种马很感兴趣，他们说：“阿尔登”杂种马性情温顺、干活好使、力量大，一匹杂种马可以顶本地马一匹半到两匹。河北省察北地区，用苏联美利奴种公羊杂交当地蒙古羊所产第一代杂种母羊，每年可以剪毛2.6公斤，比当地羊约增加160％。二代杂种公羊每年可剪毛4.92公斤，当比地羊增加300％以上，羊毛的细度和匀度，也大大改进了。辽宁省反映，养一头杂种羊的售毛收入，比养一头当地羊高一到一倍半。（附图片）
