    From Eight Million to Fifteen Billion
    The American "Time" magazine published an article on March 4, describing how an American oil tycoon, Paul Getty, made a fortune in the Middle East.
    Getty is the owner of the American Getty Oil Company. In 1930, he and his mother received an inheritance of less than eight million U.S. dollars and began buying shares in oil companies. At first, he took over a small company called Pacific Western Oil Corporation and then entered the Rockefeller Group's oil kingdom. Rockefeller's Standard Oil of New Jersey had a subsidiary called the Mission Corporation. The Mission Corporation controlled shares in two oil companies, the Tidewater Oil Company and the Skelly Oil Company. Getty took advantage of the stock market crash during the Great Depression in the early 1930s to acquire shares in the Mission Corporation, gaining control of Tidewater Oil and Skelly Oil. After World War II, various companies related to Getty also followed Standard Oil and plundered oil in the Middle East. In 1949, Pacific Western Oil Corporation, controlled by Getty, obtained 50% of the oil exploration rights in the Neutral Zone between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia (half of the oil sovereignty in the Neutral Zone belongs to Kuwait, and the other half belongs to Saudi Arabia. The part belonging to Kuwait had already been obtained by other American oil companies in 1948. The part obtained by Getty belonged to Saudi Arabia), for a price of only 9.5 million U.S. dollars; and stipulated that only one million U.S. dollars in rent would be paid annually for the first three years, and thereafter 55 cents U.S. dollars per barrel of oil. In 1953, the oil company owned by Getty began producing oil in the Neutral Zone. In 1954, oil production reached nearly three million barrels, increasing to 4.35 million barrels in 1955, and further increasing to 25,000 barrels per day in 1956. In February of this year, two new oil wells of this company began producing oil, increasing the daily output to more than 50,000 barrels. Estimated at 50,000 barrels per day, the annual oil production will be nearly 2.5 million tons!
    As oil production in the Neutral Zone increased, the stock price of Getty Oil Company also rose repeatedly, from 11 U.S. dollars in 1950 to the recent 45.25 U.S. dollars. Getty's wealth also expanded sharply. He owned 82% of the shares in Getty Oil Company, worth 300 million U.S. dollars; 64.5% of the shares in Tidewater Oil Company, worth 460 million U.S. dollars; and 59% of the shares in Skelly Oil Company, worth 335 million U.S. dollars. In addition, Getty also has a small share of about 0.4% in the international oil consortium that controls Iranian oil, worth about 8 million U.S. dollars. In the United States, Getty's capital began to enter the aircraft industry and real estate speculation. Of course, compared with the Rockefeller Group, Getty is still small, but the capital he now controls has reached as much as 1.5 billion U.S. dollars, nearly 20 times the original capital of less than 8 million U.S. dollars.
    Now, Getty is also imitating Rockefeller's monopoly path, planning to build a small "oil kingdom" from oil extraction and refining to oil transportation. The Tidewater Oil Company, which he controls, is implementing a plan to invest 250 million U.S. dollars to order oil tankers in order to transport oil from the Neutral Zone directly to markets in Western Europe, Japan, and the United States. The ninth oil tanker ordered by this company has been launched, and there are another sixteen orders. These twenty-five oil tankers will total more than 1.23 million tons. In Delaware, Ohio, a refinery built by Tidewater Oil Company is nearing completion. Once completed, this plant can produce 130,000 barrels of gasoline and diesel per day.
    However, according to "Time" magazine, Getty treats money like his life. From hotel meal expenses to taxi fares, he complained that every item was too expensive. "Time" magazine said he is a famous miser.
    Getty desperately accumulates capital, traveling between the United States, Western Europe, and the Middle East, preparing to expand the plunder of Middle East oil.
    Getty is just one of the many American oil monopoly capitalists who plunder Middle East oil resources, and his capital is relatively small. However, from the example of Getty, a man who made a fortune in the Middle East, people can imagine how much wealth American oil monopoly capital has plundered in the Middle East, and it is not difficult to understand why the U.S. government, which represents the interests of monopoly capital, proposed the "Eisenhower Doctrine" to step up aggression against the Middle East.

    从八百万到十五亿
    美国“时代”周刊在3月4日登载了一篇文章，描述了一个美国石油商——保尔·杰蒂在中东大发横财的经过。
    杰蒂是美国杰蒂石油公司的老板。1930年，他和他的母亲获得了一笔不到八百万美元的遗产，开始购买石油公司的股票。起初他接收了一个小公司——太平洋西方石油公司，然后投身到洛克菲勒集团的石油王国中去。洛克菲勒的新泽西美孚油公司设有一个子公司，叫米欣公司。米欣公司控制着两个石油公司——海滨石油公司和斯凯莱石油公司的股票。杰蒂利用三十年代初期大恐慌中股票惨跌的机会，收购米欣公司的股票，并在海滨石油公司和斯凯莱石油公司中取得了控制地位。第二次世界大战以后，和杰蒂有关系的各个公司，也追随美孚油公司之后到中东地区掠夺石油。1949年，杰蒂所控制的太平洋西方石油公司取得了科威特和沙特阿拉伯之间的中立区的石油开采特权的50％（中立区的石油主权一半属于科威特，另一半属于沙特阿拉伯。属于科威特的部分已在1948年为美国其他石油公司所得。杰蒂所取得的部分是属沙特阿拉伯的），代价只有九百五十万美元；并规定最初三年每年只付一百万美元租金，以后每桶石油交纳五角五分美元的租金。1953年杰蒂所属的石油公司在中立区开始采出石油，1954年产油量达到将近三百万桶，1955年增至四百三十五万桶，1956年又增加到每天产油二万五千桶。今年2月，这个公司又有两口新油井开始出油，这使每天的产量增加到五万桶以上。按每天五万桶估计，一年产油将近二百五十万吨！
    随着中立区石油生产的增长，杰蒂石油公司的股票也一再涨价，从1950年的十一美元上涨到最近的四十五点二五美元。杰蒂的财产也猛烈膨胀，他在杰蒂石油公司拥有82％的股票，值三亿美元；在海滨石油公司占有股权的64.5％，值四亿六千万美元；在斯凯莱石油公司占有59％，值三亿三千五百万美元。另外，在控制伊朗石油的国际石油财团中，杰蒂也有小小的一份，约千分之四，值八百万美元左右。在美国国内，杰蒂的资本开始打入飞机工业和房地产投机业。当然，同洛克菲勒集团比起来，杰蒂还是小巫见大巫，但是他现在控制的资本也达到了十五亿美元之巨，比他原有的不到八百万美元的本钱扩大了近二十倍。
    现在，杰蒂也仿效洛克菲勒的垄断道路，计划建立一个从采炼石油到运输石油的一个小小的“石油王国”。他所控制的海滨石油公司，正在执行一个投资二亿五千万美元订购油船的计划，以便把中立区的石油直接运到西欧、日本和美国的市场。这个公司所订购的第九艘油船已经下水，另外还有十六艘订货。这二十五艘油船合计将达一百二十三万多吨位。在美国俄亥俄州的特拉威尔，海滨石油公司所建的一个炼油厂快要竣工了，这个厂建成后，每天可产汽油和柴油十三万桶。
    但是，据“时代”周刊的描写，杰蒂对人却视钱如命。从旅馆的餐费到出租汽车的车资，每一项费用他都嫌太贵而喋喋不休。“时代”周刊说他是一个出名的小气鬼。
    杰蒂拼命积累资本，奔走于美国、西欧和中东各国之间，准备扩大对中东石油的掠夺。
    杰蒂只是许多掠夺中东石油资源的美国石油垄断资本家中的一个，并且他的资本是比较小的。但从杰蒂这样一个在中东发财致富的人的身上，人们就可以想见美国石油垄断资本在中东掠夺了多少财富，也就不难了解代表垄断资本利益的美国政府为什么要提出加紧侵略中东的“艾森豪威尔主义”了。
