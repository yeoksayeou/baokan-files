　　Breaking Through the Difficulty of Raw Material Shortages
　　Production at Ma'anshan Ironworks Hasn't Stopped for a Minute
　　Longyan Iron Mine Ironworks Utilizes Ore Powder and Broken Coke
　　Xinhua News Agency reporter Tang Tianzhen reports: Ma'anshan Ironworks employees exceeded the state's first-quarter production plan by more than 1,500 tons of pig iron.

　　In January and February of this year, Ma'anshan area experienced particularly heavy rain and snow. The workers managed to overcome the difficulties that rain and snow brought to production, and have not allowed iron smelting production to stop for even a minute.

　　Changes in the grade and declines in the quality of iron smelting raw materials also brought great difficulties to production. However, the workers made every effort to ensure the completion of production tasks.

　　Xinhua News Agency reporter Jian Shuzhen reports: The workers of Longyan Iron Mine Ironworks, in the situation of insufficient raw materials, exceeded the first quarter production plan by more than 530 tons.

　　This factory faced insufficient raw materials this year. The workers created a method of sintering ore powder using indigenous methods and a method of using broken coke ore to replace coke for mixed use, overcoming the difficulties of insufficient ore and coke supply.

    突破原料不足的难关
    马鞍山铁厂的生产没有停过一分钟
    龙烟铁矿炼铁厂利用矿粉和碎焦矿
    新华社记者汤天真报道：马鞍山铁厂职工超额一千五百多吨生铁完成第一季度国家的生产计划。
    今年一、二月份，马鞍山地区雨雪特别多，职工们设法克服了雨雪给生产带来的困难，一直没有让炼铁生产停止过一分钟。
    炼铁原料品位的变化和质量的下降，也给生产带来很大的困难。但是职工们尽一切努力保证了生产任务的完成。
    新华社记者简书珍报道：龙烟铁矿炼铁厂的职工们在原料不足的情况下，超额五百三十多吨完成了第一季度生产计划。
    这个厂今年原料不足。职工们创造了土法矿粉烧结法和用碎焦矿代替焦炭混合使用的办法，克服了矿石和焦炭供应不足的困难。
