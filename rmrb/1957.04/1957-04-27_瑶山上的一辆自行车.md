    A Bicycle on Yao Mountain
    Bao Yun

    People living in cities and plains are accustomed to seeing bicycles darting around on the roads. But when I left the cities and plains and occasionally encountered a bicycle in the deep mountains and ridges, it was like seeing a big fish in a stagnant pool in the desert, causing some surprise.

    Where did this bicycle come from? Taking a closer look, there was a copper plate hanging on the front of the bike, with three eye-catching lines of text:
      "Awarded to
    The First Guangdong Provincial Agricultural Model Worker
            Guangdong Provincial People's Committee"

    Giving awards to model workers is certainly necessary, but the prizes must be useful to the recipients. For example, in schools, to reward a "well-rounded" student, we give them books and stationery rather than plows or sickles. This seems to be a principle that everyone understands. However, the bicycle I saw was awarded to a Yao compatriot living in the deep mountains, which does not seem to fit such a rationale.

    I am not saying that Yao compatriots should not have bicycles. In fact, in Sanjiang, the Yao Autonomous County seat, I saw many Yao people riding bicycles back and forth on the roads. However, this "Forever" brand bicycle, awarded to the agricultural model worker, traveled by train from Guangzhou to Shuiniuwan Station, which borders Hunan Province, and then was transported by car to Liannan Yao Autonomous County. After arriving in the county town, the agricultural model worker had to drag it for forty or fifty *li* on rugged mountain roads, climbing very steep mountain roads for several *li*. Finally, when he got home, the bicycle was put aside at home and became a "hero with no place to use his skills."

    The Yao compatriots here live on the mountainside of the big mountains, more than 500 meters above sea level. The houses are densely packed. The horizontal streets and vertical alleys are all winding and crooked, with stone-paved steps, and narrow paths that only allow one or two people to pass through. Therefore, it is difficult to find a road that can be used by bicycles. Each *pai* (village) can only find a flat area, which is the small playground near the school.

    What role did this bicycle, worth a hundred *yuan*, play for this model worker? I learned a little bit. He himself spent some time in the county town learning how to use it. Every time he went to the county town for a meeting, he carried it down the mountain and walked nearly a hundred *li* of mountain road back and forth, just to ride it a bit in the town. Usually, it was put aside at home and borrowed by acquaintances to play with. The one time I personally saw it was when it was borrowed by someone from a Yao *pai* (village) more than 20 *li* away from the model worker's home to play with. They rode it around in a small playground of thirty or forty square meters at an elementary school, attracting people in the *pai* (village) to watch.

    This bicycle, which has only been around for a year, is already showing signs of aging. The bicycle has not played its role, but the model worker has spent a lot of time practicing, and the farmers, no matter how busy they are with production, spend some time to see this new thing. What positive effect does this have on agricultural production? Is this an example of bureaucracy? Let everyone judge. (Attached picture)

### 瑶山上的一辆自行车

    瑶山上的一辆自行车
    宝昀
    生活在城市和平原的人们，在公路上看见溜来溜去的自行车是习以为常的。但当我离开了城市和平原，在深山大岭上偶尔遇到了一辆自行车，就有如在沙漠里瞧见死水潭里有一尾大鱼似的，不无一些惊讶。
    这辆车是从那里来的呢？走近一看，车头上挂着一面铜牌子，牌子上有耀人眼目的三行字样：
      “奖给
    广东省第一届农业模范
            广东省人民委员会”
    给劳动模范发奖自然是必要的，但是奖品必须对于被奖的人有所用。譬如在学校里，为了奖励一个“品学兼优”的学生，奖给他一些书籍文具而不是犁耙或镰刀，这似乎是一般人都晓得的道理。但是我所见到这辆自行车是奖给一个住在深山大岭里的瑶胞，似乎就不大符合这样一个情理。
    我并不是说瑶胞就不应该有自行车，其实在瑶族自治县城的三江就看见不少瑶胞骑自行车在公路上往来。但是这辆奖给农业劳动模范的“永久”牌自行车，是从广州乘火车到和湖南省接壤的水牛湾站，再用汽车载运到连南瑶族自治县城。到县城以后，还得这位农业劳动模范拖拖拉拉走四五十里的崎岖山路，爬很陡的山路好几里。最后到了家，车便搁在家里变成“无用武之地的英雄”了。
    这里的瑶胞是住在大山岭的山腰上，海拔五百公尺以上，住房是密密排排的。横街直巷都是弯弯曲曲，用石头砌成的阶梯，并且是窄狭到仅容一二人通过的小道。因此很难找出一条路可以使用自行车，每个排（村）只能找出一块平坦的地段，那就是学校附近的小操场。
    这辆价值百把元的自行车对于这位劳动模范起了甚么作用？我略略了解一下，他本人曾花了一些时间在县城学会使用，每到县城开一次会，便把它扛下山走来回近百里的山路，到城里骑一骑。平时搁在家里，给熟人借去玩。我亲自看到的一次，就是借给远距这位劳动模范家二十多里的一个瑶排（村）的人去玩。在一个小学校三四十平方公尺的小操场转来转去。引动了排（村）中的人们来围观。
    这辆一年光景的自行车，已经显着衰老。车没有发挥它的作用，劳动模范却花了不少时间练习，农民见到这新玩意，不管生产多忙，也花费一些时间去见识。这对农业生产起了甚么积极作用呢？这是不是官僚主义的一例？让大家来判断吧。（附图片）
