    Reactions to Criticism
    Waste Rate Reduced
    Letter from the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Office: In the People's Daily editorial "Increase Production and Practice Economy Must Guarantee Quality" on December 19th last year, our plant was criticized for the waste rate of electric furnace steel in the first quarter, accounting for one-quarter of the total waste of special steel under the Iron and Steel Industry Bureau for the entire quarter. After our inspection, this is indeed the case.
    The main reason for the low quality and high waste rate is that we have serious one-sided production views in our technical guiding ideology, emphasizing quantity over quality and neglecting cost.
    This year, we are determined to use practical actions of increasing production and practicing economy to ensure the comprehensive completion of the state plan, strive to make up for last year's losses, eliminate backward indicators, and catch up with the national advanced level. In January, the electric furnace steelmaking department completed 106.8% of the production plan, and the quality index reached 99.78%, comprehensively overfulfilling the state plan.
    Concern for Workers' Production and Living Time
    Letter from Qingdao State-owned Cotton Factory No. 4: After the People's Daily published the article "Why Has the Attendance Rate Decreased?" on November 30, 1956, we immediately organized relevant personnel from the factory's Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League organizations to analyze and study all production and living time of the employees, and put forward improvement suggestions. We sincerely accept this criticism.
    Management Personnel Reduced
    Letter from Shijiazhuang Joint State-Private Xinde Electrochemical Plant: The criticism of our plant in the People's Daily on February 26th, second edition, in the article "The Evil Consequences of Excessive Management Personnel," is basically in line with the facts.
    We have now taken measures to streamline staffing.

    对批评的反应
    降低了废品率
    太原钢铁厂办公室来信：去年12月19日人民日报“增产节约必须保证质量”的社论中，批评我厂第一季度电炉钢的废品率占钢铁工业管理局全季特殊钢废品总额的四分之一。经我们检查，确实是事实。
    造成质量低、废品多的原因，主要是我们在技术指导思想上存在着严重的重量轻质、忽视成本的片面生产观点。
    今年我们决心用增产节约的实际行动保证全面完成国家计划，力争弥补去年的亏欠，消灭落后指标，赶上全国先进水平。1月份电炉炼钢部产量完成计划106.8％，质量指标达到99.78％，全面超额完成了国家计划。
    关心工人的生产生活时间
    青岛国棉四厂来信：人民日报1956年11月30日发表了“出勤率为什么降低了”一文后，我们即组织厂内党政工团有关人员对职工的全部生产、生活时间作了分析研究，提出了改进的意见。我们诚恳地接受这次批评。
    管理人员减少了
    石家庄市公私合营信德电化厂来信：人民日报2月26日二版“管理人员过多的恶果”一文对我厂的批评，基本上是符合事实的。
    现在我们已采取措施，精简编制。
