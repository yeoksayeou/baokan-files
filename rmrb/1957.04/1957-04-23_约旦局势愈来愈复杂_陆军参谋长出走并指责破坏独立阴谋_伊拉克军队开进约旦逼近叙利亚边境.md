Xinhua News Agency Comprehensive Report: According to Xinhua News Agency reports: Major General Hayari, who was appointed as the Chief of Staff of the Jordanian Army four days ago, arrived in Damascus, Syria on April 20th and submitted his resignation to the Jordanian government. At a press conference held that day, he accused the Jordanian palace of collaborating with non-Arab foreign military attachés in Amman to prepare to undermine Jordan's independence. He said that he left Jordan for Syria because he found himself unable to stop this conspiracy and had to leave Jordan under the pretext of urgently needing to contact the Syrian General Staff Headquarters.

Hayari said that at the beginning of the political crisis in Jordan, someone had asked him to contact senior army officers to find out "whether they were prepared to 'deal with the people' if the people took action to establish a government that continued to implement a policy of alliance with Syria and Egypt." Hayari said that the army leaders flatly refused to take on such a role, and so the conspiracy began to be planned.

He said that the troops stationed in Zerqa were ordered to prepare, which ignited a war between these troops under the pretext that the former Chief of Staff of the Army, Nowar, and other officers planned to carry out a military coup. Then, Nowar and Nimer, who had been appointed to form a cabinet at the time, were summoned to the Royal Palace surrounded by armored forces. Then the loudspeakers announced that Nowar had been detained and Nimer had been dismissed from his appointment to form a cabinet.

Hayari said that he then went to the Royal Palace and "made great efforts to persuade the King to believe that the army had absolutely no intention of launching a coup against him, but rather that others were carrying out a conspiracy detrimental to the army and the country."

Hayari said that the King promised him that he would "establish a nationalist government that could be accepted by the people." But when the King convened a meeting of Jordanian political leaders at the palace the next day, the Royal Palace was surrounded by armored forces, and armed soldiers walked back and forth in the palace, threatening the leaders present." Thus, "in this atmosphere" the government of Prime Minister Halidi was formed, and two days later, "in violation of the promises made to me, the second stage of the conspiracy began, when General Nowar was forced to resign and it was accepted."

Hayari said that he himself was then appointed as Chief of Staff, "with the task of transferring certain officers, dismissing certain officers, and conducting an investigation with a predetermined result." He had been "asked to play the role of a docile tool..."

Hayari said, "Because I failed to persuade the leaders to abandon this plan, I left the country under the circumstances I just described, in order to draw the attention of Arab and world public opinion."

The Jordanian cabinet held two meetings on April 20 after Hayari submitted his resignation, and then issued an official communiqué, announcing that Hayari had submitted his letter of resignation, and saying that before taking a final decision on this matter, Major General Majali, the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Jordanian Army, was appointed as Acting Chief of Staff.

The communiqué also announced the establishment of a ministerial committee headed by the Jordanian Prime Minister to supervise the investigation by a special military committee into "certain regrettable events that occurred in certain units of the army" last week.

Reuters news agency said that the recent transfers and reorganizations of many key positions in the Jordanian army would give the King more and more real power. It is believed that this approach is aimed at preparing to suppress various parties and the masses in the streets, so that the King can finally receive the delegation of U.S. President's Special Envoy Richards without worrying about violent incidents.

Jordanian Foreign Minister Nabulsi accused foreign diplomats at a press conference on the 21st of engaging in behind-the-scenes activities and interfering in Jordan's internal affairs during Jordan's intense crisis.

Nabulsi said that he believes that the new Halidi government must implement the decision to establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.

When a reporter asked whether the establishment of a Soviet diplomatic mission in Jordan would become a threat to the interior of Jordan, Nabulsi countered: "Why should we be more afraid of Soviet diplomats than of other people? I can say here that I have noticed that other diplomatic missions have been interfering in our domestic affairs."

When talking about the "Eisenhower Doctrine," Nabulsi said, "We are willing to accept assistance from any country as long as this assistance can help us without interfering in our sovereignty." He said that the Jordanian government sent a memorandum to the U.S. Embassy in Amman on February 4, expressing welcome to Richards to visit Jordan, but has not received a reply.

A few hours before Nabulsi's speech, Jordanian Prime Minister Halidi said when he met with American reporters that he was willing to discuss the Eisenhower Doctrine with U.S. President's Special Envoy Richards. He "hopes that Richards will then come to this small country after visiting Egypt and Syria."

Halidi said that he himself "does not believe" that non-Arab foreign military attachés carried out a conspiracy against Jordan.

There are reports that the situation on the West Bank of the Jordan River is tense. In the Jordanian area of Jerusalem and Ramallah, students held demonstrations in the streets on April 19, demanding that Prime Minister Halidi expel U.S. Ambassador Mallory from Jordan. The student demonstrators were dispersed by the police. The King of Jordan has dispatched his Director of Public Security, General Mohammed Ma'eta, to Jerusalem.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, April 22nd (telegram) According to a report from Amman by the Middle East News Agency on the evening of the 21st, the troops of Iraq, a member of the Baghdad Pact, have entered Jordan and are stationed near the Syrian troops stationed in Mafraq. Mafraq is forty-five miles northeast of Amman, close to the Syrian border.

The news agency said that Syrian President Kuwatli had called Jordanian King Hussein regarding Iraq's entry into Jordan, asking him to take action.

At the same time, officers of the Syrian troops stationed in Jordan have ordered their personnel not to leave their barracks until the political crisis in Jordan is over.

The Middle East News Agency also reported that Hussein met with Syrian Ambassador to Jordan Qadamani and Egyptian Military Attaché to Jordan Bilal on the 21st.

    约旦局势愈来愈复杂
    陆军参谋长出走并指责破坏独立阴谋
    伊拉克军队开进约旦逼近叙利亚边境
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：四天前被任命为约旦陆军参谋长的哈亚里少将在4月20日到达叙利亚大马士革，并向约旦政府提出辞职。在当天举行的记者招待会上，他指责约旦宫廷同安曼的非阿拉伯外国武官合作准备破坏约旦的独立。他说，他离开约旦到叙利亚来是因为发现自己不能制止这个阴谋，不得不假托迫切要同叙利亚参谋本部联系，而离开了约旦。
    哈亚里说，在约旦政治危机开始时，曾经有人要求他同高级陆军军官接触以便弄明白“如果人民行动起来硬要成立一个继续实行同叙利亚和埃及联盟的政策的政府时”，他们是否准备“对付人民”。哈亚里说，陆军领袖们断然拒绝担任这样的角色，于是就开始筹划这个阴谋。
    他说，驻扎在泽尔卡的部队奉令作好准备，于是煽动了这些部队之间的一场战事，借口是前陆军参谋长诺瓦尔和其他一些军官打算实行武力政变。然后，诺瓦尔和当时已被任命组阁的尼默尔被召到了由装甲部队包围的王宫。接着扩音器宣布诺瓦尔已被扣留，尼默尔被解除组阁的任命。
    哈亚里说，于是他前往王宫，“费了极大的努力想说服国王，使他相信陆军绝对没有发动反对他的政变的打算，相反的倒是别人在进行不利于陆军和国家的阴谋”。
    哈亚里说，国王答应他，将“成立一个能为人民所接受的民族主义政府”。但是当国王次日在宫中召集约旦政治领袖们举行会议时，王宫被装甲部队包围起来，武装的士兵们在宫中来来往往，威胁着在场的领袖们”。于是，“就在这种气氛下”组成了哈利迪首相的政府，两天以后，“违反了对我所作的诺言，开始了第二个阶段的阴谋，那时诺瓦尔将军被迫提出了辞职而且被接受了”。
    哈亚里说，他本人于是被任命为参谋长，“任务是调动某些军官，黜退某些军官，以及进行一种事先准备好结果的调查”。他曾经被“要求担任一个驯顺的工具的角色……”
    哈亚里说，“我由于未能劝服领袖们放弃这种计划，就在我方才所说的情况下离开了国家，以求提起阿拉伯和世界舆论的注意。”
    约旦内阁4月20日在哈亚里提出辞职后举行了两次会议，随后发表了一个正式公报，宣布哈亚里已经提出辞职书，并且说，在这个问题上采取最后决定之前，任命约旦陆军副参谋长马贾利少将为代理参谋长。
    这个公报还宣布成立以约旦首相为首的大臣委员会，来监督一个特别军事委员会对上星期“在陆军某些部队中发生的某些令人遗憾的事件”的调查工作。
    路透社的消息说，最近约旦陆军好些主要职位的调动和改组，会使愈来愈多的实权落在国王的手中。人们认为，这样的做法，目的在于准备镇压各党派和街上的群众，使国王最后能够在不必担心发生暴力事件的情况下接待美国总统特使理查兹的代表团。
    约旦外交大臣纳布西21日在记者招待会上指责外国外交官正在约旦的激烈的危机中进行幕后活动，干涉约旦内政。
    纳布西说，他认为新的哈利迪政府必须贯彻执行和苏联建交的决定。
    有记者问到苏联在约旦建立外交使团是否会成为对约旦内部的威胁，纳布西反问说：“我们为什么要害怕苏联的外交人员甚于害怕其他的人呢？我可以在这里说，我已经注意到其他的外交使团已经在干涉我们的国内事务。”
    在谈到“艾森豪威尔主义”的时候，纳布西说，“我们愿意接受任何国家的援助，只要这种援助能够帮助我们而又不干涉我们的主权。”他说，约旦政府曾经在2月4日向美国驻安曼大使馆发出一个备忘录，表示欢迎理查兹来约旦访问，但是没有接到答复。
    在纳布西发表谈话前几小时，约旦新任首相哈利迪在接见美国记者的时候说，他愿意同美国总统特使理查兹讨论艾森豪威尔主义。他“希望理查兹在访问埃及和叙利亚以后，将接着来这个小国家”。
    哈利迪说，他本人“不相信”非阿拉伯的外国武官进行了反对约旦的阴谋。
    有消息说，约旦河西岸的形势紧张，在耶路撒冷约旦区和拉马拉，4月19日有学生在街上举行示威要求首相哈利迪把美国大使马洛里驱逐出约旦，举行示威的学生队伍被警察驱散。约旦国王已经派遣他的公安长官穆罕默德·马埃塔将军前往耶路撒冷。
    新华社开罗22日电　据中东通讯社21日晚自安曼报道，巴格达条约成员国伊拉克的军队已经开进约旦，驻扎在驻麦法拉克的叙利亚军队的附近。麦法拉克在安曼东北四十五英里，靠近叙利亚边境。
    这家通讯社说，叙利亚总统库阿特利已经就伊拉克进入约旦一事打电话给约旦国王侯赛因，要求他采取行动。
    与此同时，叙利亚驻约旦部队的军官已经命令他们的人员在约旦的政治危机结束之前不要走出营房。
    中东通讯社的消息还说，侯赛因在21日接见了叙利亚驻约旦大使卡达马尼和埃及驻约旦军事参赞比拉尔。
