In the current situation where agricultural cooperatives are relatively large and members live scattered, making it difficult to convene members' meetings, the members' representative assembly is effectively the highest management body of the agricultural cooperative. According to the model charter of advanced agricultural production cooperatives, the members' representative assembly can exercise the powers of the members' meeting. All major issues within the cooperative must be discussed and decided by the members' representative assembly, and the management committee must act in accordance with the decisions of the members' representative assembly. The CCP Central Committee's March 15th notification on several matters concerning democratic cooperative management stated that agricultural cooperatives and their production teams should consult with the masses when deciding on issues. Convening a members' representative assembly is one of the most important ways for the cooperative's leading cadres to discuss matters with the cooperative members.

When the Tiancun Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shijingshan District, Beijing, transitioned into an advanced cooperative last year, there was a phenomenon of extravagance and waste. Cooperative cadres were careless with spending, and some money was used inappropriately. Members did not cherish public property very much, and public property was damaged and lost a lot. The cooperative also saw the growth of the practice of randomly recording work points. The cooperative's leading cadres were alert to these problems and resolved to implement diligence and frugality in running the cooperative. They convened a members' representative assembly to discuss how to run the cooperative diligently and frugally. The representative assembly was held for four nights. The representatives put forward more than one hundred opinions, with suggestions and criticisms. The representatives not only discussed and decided on major issues such as which expenses could be reduced, how to establish a strict financial management system, and how to reasonably subsidize cadres' work points for official business, but also reported many agricultural tools and furniture that had long been lost on the spot. For example, a seven-inch walking plow, which had been lost for two years, was found in the firewood pile after the assembly. The representatives not only came up with ways to save money from all aspects, saving a lot of funds, but also put forward many important suggestions for developing production. For example, increasing the height of the sloped glass surface of greenhouses with supports in order to plant one more ridge of cucumbers or two more ridges of tomatoes, planting mustard on the ridges and backs of the vegetable garden land, and expanding the radish field by 300 mu – these three suggestions alone could increase income by more than 40,000 yuan, and they are simple and easy to implement. When the Baishan Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Jilin City was formulating this year's production plan, it found that there was a shortage of means of production and that some members had difficulties in their lives. The whole cooperative lacked a total of 6,000 cartloads of manure fertilizer, 27 draught animals, 80,000 jin of fodder, a large number of items such as racks and reeds for planting vegetables, and also lacked cash. The cooperative management committee called this the "five lacks" difficulty and held several management committee meetings, but did not come up with a way to overcome the difficulties. Finally, it was decided to convene a members' representative assembly to mobilize the masses to come up with solutions together. Since the members' representative assembly was convened, this cooperative now has a way to turn the "five lacks" into "five no lacks." Since the cooperative convened the members' representative assembly on February 7, more than 80 carts have been going to Jilin City every day to collect manure, and more than 800 carts have been collected before February 15. Men, women, old and young, have all taken action, setting off a surge of spring plowing preparation. From these two examples, it can be seen how much power the members' representative assembly can generate!

The key to successfully convening the members' representative assembly is to enable the representatives to speak freely without any worries and to conduct repeated and detailed discussions on the matters raised. In the Xiawutun Agricultural Cooperative in Xingyi County, Guizhou Province, a members' representative assembly was held last spring to discuss the issue of contracting work and output. At the meeting, the cooperative's leading cadres made a mobilization report for the whole day, and only three representatives had the opportunity to speak when the meeting was about to end. They suggested that the output target was too high. But before they could finish speaking, the cooperative cadre interrupted and said, "Too high? The cooperative is strong and has plenty of manpower and livestock. Why worry about not being able to do it!" In this way, the opinions of the cooperative members were rejected in one sentence. Although this members' representative assembly "passed" the management committee's plan for contracting work and output, the members said, "The production plan is the management committee's, not ours." In the end, none of the 57 production teams in the whole cooperative achieved the output target. In the case of the Tiancun Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Beijing mentioned earlier, when they first convened the members' representative assembly, the cadres and Party members would often explain as soon as the representatives spoke, and the representatives swallowed back their words. Wang Fuhai, the director of the cooperative, described the situation at the time as "the cooperative cadres talked, the representatives always agreed, and there was no change after the meeting." Last year, in order to correct the undemocratic shortcomings, the Party branch of the cooperative first held a branch Party member meeting before convening the members' representative assembly to discuss the issue of diligence and frugality in running the cooperative, mobilizing all Party members and cadres to listen to the opinions of the representatives with an open mind. And it made the following decision: when the cooperative members' representatives speak, no Party member or cadre is allowed to "explain" on the spot, let alone reject the representatives' speeches. No matter whether the words are right or wrong, they must be allowed to finish speaking. At the meeting, the Party members and cadres who were not democratic enough in their style made self-criticisms, and sufficient time was given to the representatives to discuss the issues. As a result, the meeting was very successful.

In the past year, many agricultural cooperatives have lacked normal democratic life because the leading cadres were not democratic enough in their style, or they did not convene members' representative assemblies for a long time, or they only regarded the members' representative assemblies as a tool for "raising hands to pass" plans and programs. Some things that could have been done well were done badly, and some problems that could have been solved were not solved. Some cooperative cadres always think that they are more clever than the masses, that the masses should listen to them, and that they do not need to listen to the masses; or they only see the leaders above and do not see the masses. When problems arise, they only know to ask the leaders above for solutions, and they do not know that the leaders' solutions are actually concentrated from the masses.

Whether or not democracy can be fully promoted and members' representative assemblies can be successfully convened is also closely related to whether the organization of the assembly is appropriate and whether the selection of representatives has broad representation. If there are too many representatives, with hundreds of people meeting together, it will be difficult to conduct democratic and detailed discussions. If there are too many people, there will be fewer opportunities for each person to speak. Those who can speak will say a lot, and those who cannot speak will not have the opportunity to speak. This is nominally democratic (many representatives), but actually undemocratic. A large meeting with a large number of people is suitable as a general publicity or mobilization meeting, but it is not appropriate as a meeting to discuss and solve problems. Therefore, the number of representatives in the members' representative assembly should not be too large, and generally 20 to 30 or 30 to 40 people are more appropriate. If there are too few people, can the opinions of the cooperative members not be widely absorbed? Whether the opinions of the cooperative members can be widely absorbed does not completely depend on the number of representatives. As long as the cooperative management committee notifies the representatives of the matters to be discussed in advance and they conduct full deliberation with the cooperative members in advance, the cooperative members' representatives can truly be representative. When such representatives meet together, although there are not many people, they can truly solve problems. As for some particularly large cooperatives, where there are too many representatives and it is not easy to discuss issues, the method of holding meetings in separate areas can also be adopted. Not only should the number of representatives in the members' representative assembly not be too large, but the number of items to be discussed each time should not be too many. If there are too many problems, none of them can be thoroughly solved. It would be very good if one major problem could be solved at each assembly.

Whether the members' representative assembly can have broad representation depends on whether the candidates for representatives can represent cooperative members in various different situations. Due to the different economic status, labor strength, and knowledge and experience of each cooperative member, their views on things will also be different. The purpose of convening a members' representative assembly is to gather the views and opinions of various cooperative members on a certain issue, and after discussion, to become a unified opinion and turn it into a consistent action for all cooperative members. Therefore, the cooperative members' representatives should include cooperative members in various different situations. There should be poor peasants, lower-middle peasants and upper-middle peasants. There should be young people, adults, old people and women. Although the cooperative members' representatives are mainly ordinary cooperative members, there should also be a certain number of cadres. Some cooperatives believe that elderly cooperative members are ideologically conservative and do not want elderly people to be representatives, which is very wrong. Some cooperatives are unwilling to have upper-middle peasants as representatives, which is also wrong. The Party's class policy is to rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants and consolidate the unity of the upper-middle peasants. How can we consolidate the unity with the upper-middle peasants if we are unwilling to listen to their opinions and unwilling to discuss matters with them?

Comrades working in rural areas in various places should help agricultural cooperatives learn to use the most important system in democratic cooperative management—the members' representative assembly—and fully mobilize the masses' enthusiasm for running the cooperative, and come up with more good ways for this year's bumper harvest. Of course, in the case where large cooperatives have been changed into small cooperatives, or where production brigades are independently managed with responsibility for their own profits and losses, the number of cooperative member households has been greatly reduced, and it is also possible to appropriately adopt some forms of members' meetings to discuss and decide on issues according to the opinions of the masses. Other forms such as forums, old farmers' associations, and group meetings, etc., as long as they are convenient for absorbing and concentrating the opinions of cooperative members, can be flexibly adopted.

### 开好社员代表大会

    开好社员代表大会
    在目前农业社规模较大、社员居住比较分散，因而社员大会不容易召开的情况下，社员代表大会实际上就是农业社的最高管理机关。按照高级农业生产合作社示范章程的规定，社员代表大会可以代行社员大会的职权。社内一切重大问题，必须经过社员代表大会讨论决定，管理委员会必须遵照社员代表大会的决定办事。中共中央3月15日关于民主办社几个事项的通知中提出：农业社和它的生产队决定问题要同群众商量。开社员代表大会，正是社的领导干部同社员群众商量事情的一个最重要的方式。
    北京市石景山区田村农业生产合作社，去年开始转成高级社的时候，有铺张浪费现象。社干部花钱不在乎，有些钱用得不恰当。社员不太爱惜公物，公共财物损坏、丢失了不少。社里还滋长了乱记工分的风气。社的领导干部警觉了这些问题，决心实行勤俭办社；他们就召开了社员代表大会，讨论怎样勤俭办社的问题。代表大会开了四个晚上。代表们提出了一百多条意见，有建议，有批评。代表们不仅讨论决定了哪些开支可以减缩，怎样建立严明的财务管理制度、怎样合理补贴干部因公误工的工分等重大问题，而且当场报出了许多早已遗失了的农具、家具。如一副七寸步犁，已经遗失了两年，开过大会，就在柴草堆里找出来了。代表们不仅从各方面想出了节约的办法，节省了大量资金，而且提出了许多发展生产的重要建议。像把温室的斜玻璃面用支架支高，以便多种一垅黄瓜或二垅西红柿，在菜园地的垅道和垅背上点种芥菜、扩大萝卜地三百亩这三项建议，就可以增加收入四万多元，而且简便易行。吉林市郊白山农业生产合作社，在制订今年的生产计划的时候，发现生产资料不足，部分社员生活有困难。计全社共缺粪肥六千车、耕畜二十七头、饲草八万斤，缺种植蔬菜用的架条、苇子等大量物品，还缺乏现金。社管理委员会把这叫做“五缺”之难，开了几次管理委员会议，也没有想出克服困难的办法。最后决定召开社员代表大会，发动群众共同来想办法。社员代表大会召开以后，现在这个社已经有办法把“五缺”变成“五不缺”。这个社2月7日开过了社员代表大会以后，每天都有八十多辆车子进吉林市去拣粪，2月15日以前，已经拣回八百多车。男女老幼都已经行动起来，掀起了备耕的热潮。从这两个例子可以看出，社员代表大会能够产生出来多么大的力量！
    开好社员代表大会的关键，是使代表们能够毫无顾虑，畅所欲言，对提出的事项能够进行反复的详尽的讨论。贵州省兴义县下五屯农业社，去年春季召开社员代表大会讨论包工包产问题。会上，社的领导干部作了一整天的动员报告，临到会议快结束的时候，才有三个代表得到发言的机会，他们提出包产指标过高了。但是他们的话还没有说完，社干部就抢过来说：“高啥？合作社人强马壮，还愁做不到！”这样，一句话就把社员代表的意见顶回去了。这次社员代表大会虽然“通过”了社管理委员会的包工包产方案，但社员们说：“生产计划是管理委员会的，不是我们的。”全社五十七个生产队，最终没有一个达到了包产指标。前面提到的北京郊区田村农业社，他们最初开社员代表大会也常常是代表一说话，党员和干部就解释，代表把话都咽回去了。社主任王福海形容当时的情景是“社干讲一套，代表老同意，会后没改变”。去年社的党支部为了纠正不民主的缺点，在召集讨论勤俭办社问题的那一次社员代表大会以前，先开了支部党员大会，动员全体党员干部虚心倾听代表意见。并且作出这样的决定：社员代表发言的时候，任何党员干部不许当场“解释”，更不许把代表的发言顶回去，无论话说得对不对，一定要让他说完。开会的时候，作风不够民主的党员干部作了检讨，又以充分的时间供代表讨论问题。结果，会开得很好。
    过去一年当中，许多农业社由于领导干部作风不够民主，或者长时期不召开社员代表大会，或者把社员代表大会只当做“举手通过”计划、方案的工具，使农业社缺乏正常的民主生活，有些本来可以办好的事办坏了，本来可以解决的问题得不到解决。有些社干部总以为自己要比群众高明，群众应该听自己的，自己用不着听群众的；或者眼睛里只有上级领导，看不见群众，有了问题只知道向上级要办法，不知道上级的办法其实也是从群众当中集中起来的。
    能不能充分发扬民主，开好社员代表大会，这和大会的组织是否得法、代表的人选是否具有广泛的代表性等情况也有很大关系。如果代表人数太多，上百人在一起开会，就很难进行民主的详尽的讨论。人太多了，每人发言的机会就少了，能说的说得很多，不能说的没有说话的机会。这样形式上很民主（代表多），实际上不民主。人数众多的大会作为一般的宣传或动员的会议是合适的，作为讨论问题解决问题的会议就不恰当。因此，社员代表大会的代表人数不能过多，一般以二三十人到三四十人比较适当。人数少了，是不是不能把社员群众的意见普遍吸收上来呢？社员群众的意见能否普遍吸收上来，不完全决定于代表人数的多少。只要社管理委员会事先把要讨论的事项通知代表，由他们事先同社员群众在一起进行充分酝酿，社员代表就可以真正具有代表性。这样的代表在一起开会，人数虽然不多，却可以真正解决问题。至于有些特别大的社，代表人数太多，不容易讨论问题，也可以采用分片开会的办法。社员代表大会不仅人数不宜过多，每次讨论的事项也不宜多。问题多了，哪个问题也不能透彻地加以解决。每次大会能解决一个重大问题，也就很好了。
    社员代表大会能否具有广泛的代表性，决定于代表人选是不是能代表社内各种情况不同的社员。社员由于各人的经济地位不同、劳动力强弱不同、知识经历多少不同，对事情的看法也会有所不同。召开社员代表大会的目的是把各种社员对某个问题的看法和意见集中起来，经过讨论，成为统一的意见，并且变成全体社员的一致行动。因此，社员代表应该包括各种情况不同的社员。应该有贫农、下中农和上中农，应该有青年人、壮年人、老年人和妇女。虽然社员代表主要是一般社员，也应该有一定数量的干部。有些社认为老年社员思想保守，不要老年人当代表，这是很错误的。有的社不愿意要上中农当代表，这也是不对的。党的阶级政策是依靠贫农和下中农，巩固地团结上中农。不愿意听取上中农的意见，不愿意和他们商量办事，怎么能巩固和上中农的团结呢？
    各地农村工作同志要帮助农业社学会运用民主办社当中最重要的制度——社员代表大会，把群众的办社积极性充分发动起来，为今年的大丰收想出更多的好办法。当然，在大社已经改成小社，或者由生产大队自负盈亏独立经营的情况下，社员户数大大减少了，也可以根据群众意见，适当地采用一些社员大会的形式来讨论决定问题。其他如座谈会、老农会、小组会，等等，只要是便于吸收和集中社员群众意见的形式，都可以灵活地采用。
