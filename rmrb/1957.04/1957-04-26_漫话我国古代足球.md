A Casual Talk on Ancient Chinese Football
    Zuo Jian, Nan Gognwang
    There is a story: During the Tang Dynasty, a scholar waited specifically for the Prime Minister to watch a football match to "pay his respects," hoping to show off his skills and gain important employment. When the Prime Minister was reading his letter of self-recommendation, he intentionally intercepted a ball, performing tricks like "shoulder decoration," "inverted knee," "head topping," and "crotch circling," dancing all over until the Prime Minister finished reading the letter and he still hadn't stopped. The Prime Minister greatly appreciated it. It seems that the way ancient football was played and the way shuttlecock is played had similar aspects.
    But playing shuttlecock now is far less rich than playing football in ancient times. In ancient times, playing football could involve from one, two, three to ten people; the number of balls ranged from one to two (initially, soft things were stuffed inside cooked leather, later, cow bladders were used as cysts); the goal could be about two "zhang" high, or holes could be dug in the ground, the number of goals could be as many as twelve; the field could be a high platform, or a courtyard; the way of playing could be a shooting competition, or a technical performance. For more than two thousand years, it has been loved by people from emperors to common people, and praised and described by poets, historians, painters, and novelists. Emperors who loved to play football, as seen in official history or unofficial history, were quite a few: Liu Bang of the Han Dynasty's own father wanted to resign from being "Taishang Huang" because he had no football to play; Emperor Cheng of the Han Dynasty got emotional because he had no football to play, and his ministers quickly offered chess games; Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty and Emperor Xuanzong of the Tang Dynasty were football masters, and Emperor Xuanzong even showed off in "international competitions"; Emperor Taizu of the Song Dynasty, Emperor Taizong, and their four ministers could be called the six friends of the football field, with images of six people "cuju"; Emperor Xuanzong of the Ming Dynasty, Zhu Zhanji, regarded watching football as "having fun," and could at least be regarded as a "football fan." With the emperor so active, the princes and ministers would naturally not lag behind: Huo Qubing of the Han Dynasty built a football field during a distant expedition; the football field built by Ma Yuan's third son was longer than the street (but it is not known how long the street was); the football skills of Prince Consort Chai Shao, who was related to Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty, won him betrothal gifts; Prime Minister Zhao Pu of the Song Dynasty and Zheng En, who "recruited a son-in-law by hitting a melon," were two of the above-mentioned six friends. The poet Du Fu's "ten years of cuju will make Wei Yuan," probably means that he practiced for ten years, not that he "also likes to kick a few times when he is free." Because the Jinshi of the Tang Dynasty had to be able to participate in football matches, they had to work hard on weekdays. Shi Nai'an, who wrote "Water Margin," and Chu Renhuo, who wrote "Romance of Sui and Tang Dynasties," both described football in great detail and movingly (see the second chapter of "Water Margin" and the seventeenth chapter of "Romance of Sui and Tang Dynasties"), which shows that they were all experts. As for the vast majority of the common people, although there is no record, from "Linzi is very rich and solid, and its people all play the yu, play the zither, ... kick the ball" in the "Strategies of the Warring States" (Qi Volume); Pei Songzhi's note in "Records of the Three Kingdoms," "The year is full of military activities, the emperor takes archery and horsemanship as his duty, and families take cuju as their learning"; and the custom paintings of girls playing football on porcelain pillows of the Song Dynasty, it can be asserted that they were football enthusiasts. If we further savor the words between the lines of the writings of lyricists and men of letters, those who cheered around, and those who plucked feathers and sewed balls in the corners were all common people.
    It is undeniable that China had football more than two thousand years ago, and the records in historical books are solid proof. Because of these records, we know the brilliant achievements of our ancestors in sports. However, the exploration of ancient football is only the beginning. We still lack a systematic understanding of how it originated, developed, and declined. Other aspects, such as specific rules, field facilities, and the relationship between various activities (such as polo, shuttlecock), have not been clarified. Writing to this point, I cannot help but mention the "Cuju New Book" of the early Han Dynasty. This world's earliest football series, published two thousand years ago, has inestimable cultural value and historical data value of its twenty-five treatises, but unfortunately it has been lost.
    It is said that around the "May Fourth" Movement, some people in Yichang, Hubei, saw farmers blowing "cow bladder football" with small bamboo tubes. The "May Fourth" Movement was only thirty years ago, perhaps ancient football has not completely disappeared today, perhaps some living materials can still be obtained from the mouths of old acrobats, old martial arts masters, and old shuttlecock players in their seventies and eighties. If we pay attention to visiting folk artists, it will be beneficial to some extent. (Attached image)

    漫话我国古代足球
    左坚　南宫望
    有这样一个故事：唐代有一个书生，特地等到宰相看足球赛的时候去“晋谒”，想借此一显身手，以博重用。当宰相阅读他的自荐信时，他有意截获一球，“用肩妆”、“倒膝”、“顶头”、“盘拐”等花样，浑身舞弄了一番，直到宰相看完信还没有停止。宰相大为赏识。看来，古代足球的踢法和毽子的踢法有相近的地方。
    但现在玩毽子远不及古代玩足球来得丰富。古代踢足球，人数能从一人、二人、三人到十人；球的数目从一个到两个（最初是熟皮里塞软东西，后来是用牛膀胱等做胆囊）；球门可以在两丈左右的高处，也可以在平地上挖窟窿，球门的数目可以多到十二个；球场有的是高台，有的是院落；踢法可以作射门竞赛，也可以作技术表演。二千多年间，它受到了上自皇帝，下至黎民百姓的热爱，以及诗人、史家、画工、稗官等的赞颂和描述。爱踢足球的皇帝，见于正史或野史的就有一大批：汉刘邦的亲老子因为没有足球踢要辞掉“太上皇”不干；汉成帝因为没有足球踢而闹情绪，臣子们赶紧献上棋类游戏；唐太宗、唐玄宗是足球名手，唐玄宗在“国际竞赛”中还出过风头；宋太祖、宋太宗和他们的四个臣子可称为球场六友，有六人“蹴鞠”的图像；明宣宗朱瞻基把看球作为“行乐”，至少算得上个“球迷”。皇帝如此积极，王公大臣自然不会落后：汉霍去病远征时还修筑球场；马援的第三个儿子修的球场比街道还长（但不知街道有多长）；和唐太宗是郎舅关系的驸马公柴绍的球艺曾博得彩礼；宋代的赵普相爷和“打瓜招亲”的郑恩就是上述六友中的二友。诗人杜甫的“十年蹴鞠将维远”，大概是指自己练了十年，并不是“有空时也喜欢踢几脚”。因为唐代的进士们必须能参加足球赛，非平日痛下工夫不行。写水浒的施耐庵、写隋唐演义的褚人获，关于足球的描述都很细致动人（见水浒第二回、隋唐演义第十七回），足见都是内行。至于广大黎民百姓，虽然没有记述，但从战国策（齐卷）“临淄甚富而实，其民无不吹竽、鼓瑟，……蹹鞠者”；裴松之注三国志，“年兴金革，上以弓马为务，家以蹴鞠为学”；以及宋代陶枕上有少女踢足球的风俗画来看，可以断言他们是足球的爱好者。假使再从词人、墨客的著述的字里行间去寻味，那些在四周喝采，在暗角里挦毛、缝球的无一不是黎民百姓。
    我国二千多年前就有了足球是不容置疑的，史书的记载确凿可证。由于这些记载，使我们知道了祖先在体育运动方面的辉煌成就。然而对古代足球的探索还只是开始。究竟它是怎样发生、发展和衰亡的，还缺乏系统的了解。其他如具体规则、场地设施、各种活动的关系（如马球、毽子），也都没有弄清楚。写到这里，不能不提到汉初的“蹴鞠新书”。这部二千年前出版的、世界上最早的足球丛书，本身的文化价值和它的二十五篇论著的史料价值，都是无法估量的，但不幸失传了。
    据说，“五四”运动前后，还有人在湖北宜昌一带看见农民用小竹管吹灌“牛膀胱足球”。“五四”运动距现在不过三十几年，也许古代足球到今天还没有完全绝迹，也许在七、八十岁的老杂技家、老武术师、老踢毽手的嘴里还能讨来一些活资料。如果我们留心访察民间艺人，多少会有好处。（附图片）
