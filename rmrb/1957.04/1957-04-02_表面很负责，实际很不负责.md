    Superficially Responsible, Actually Irresponsible
    Ming Zhi
    “The public property of the People’s Republic of China is sacred and inviolable. It is the duty of every citizen to cherish and protect public property.” This is the solemn provision of Article 101 of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of China.
    Regrettably, the phenomenon of sitting idly by while state assets suffer losses still “legally” exists. In the second and third quarters of 1955, the Pingdi Quan Department Store Wholesale Station transferred a batch of batteries from the Qingdao Department Store Wholesale Station. Some of these batteries deteriorated during the warranty period. After negotiations between the two parties, it was decided to return the deteriorated portion to Qingdao, where the factory would be responsible for compensation. The Pingdi Quan Wholesale Station then shipped all the “deteriorated batteries” back to Qingdao from Inner Mongolia. However, after inspection, it was found that 1,915 dozens out of the first batch of 2,524 dozens of returned batteries had not deteriorated; and 382 dozens out of another batch of 462 dozens had not deteriorated. Naturally, the Qingdao station and the factory would not agree to this practice, and thus the buck-passing began. From January 10, 1956, when Pingdi Quan sent back the batteries, it took until October 16 to “resolve” the issue. However, batteries are a commodity with a shelf life, generally six to ten months. Therefore, although the problem was "resolved," both parties sat idly by and ignored the batteries during the nine months and six days of buck-passing, allowing them to expire, resulting in a scrapping loss of 3,996.76 yuan for the state.
    Another example is the Shanghai Daily Sundries Station of the East China Supply and Marketing Cooperative, which sent 200 dozens of tire pumps to the Qingdao Department Store Wholesale Station that did not conform to the contract specifications. After repeated negotiations between the two parties, and after reporting to the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives and the China Department Store Company and other central agencies for arbitration, and involving the Qingdao Municipal Bureau of Commerce and other administrative leadership departments, it took a year from the second quarter of 1955 to "resolve" the matter. During this long "negotiation" stage, the tire pumps rusted, and the repair costs alone amounted to more than 600 yuan.
    Similar incidents are not uncommon in enterprises across the country. Do you mean that these comrades do not understand the importance of cherishing state assets? Not at all! Just look at how sharp their mutual warnings and criticisms are during the buck-passing negotiations: “Your unit’s work style of disregarding the major losses suffered by state assets is intolerable.” “In order to avoid further and greater losses to state assets, please handle this matter promptly…” How clearly they understand the big picture and care for the country! Unfortunately, these comrades have too narrow and one-sided an understanding of "state assets." In their minds, only the materials for which they or their unit are responsible are considered "state assets"; as long as the "responsibility lies with the other party," and "the other party is responsible for all losses," then even if the value is tens of thousands of yuan or the quantity is thousands of kilograms, the loss is none of their business.
    We are not against investigating responsibility for these kinds of issues and giving due criticism or punishment to those who are indeed irresponsible or do not seriously implement contracts. But while negotiating problems, the first thing we should think about is: don't let the loss of state assets continue to expand. While seriously investigating responsibility, we should also try to quickly salvage the losses that have already been caused (regardless of who is responsible). This is the right thing to do. If you are only keen on buck-passing and chasing responsibility, and adopt an attitude of indifference to state assets, it may seem that you are a warrior who safeguards national interests and has a strong sense of responsibility, but in essence, you are a person who damages state property and is extremely irresponsible!

    “中华人民共和国的公共财产神圣不可侵犯。爱护和保卫公共财产是每一个公民的义务”。这是中华人民共和国宪法第一百零一条的庄严规定。
    遗憾的是：某些坐视国家资财蒙受损失的现象竟还“合法”地存在着。平地泉百货批发站1955年二、三两季度从青岛百货批发站调进电池一批，其中有一部分在保险期内变质，经双方交涉，决定将变质部分发回青岛，由厂方负责赔偿。平地泉批发站便把“变质电池”全部由内蒙古运回了青岛。但经过检查，发回的第一批二千五百二十四打电池中，有一千九百十五打并未变质；另一批四百六十二打中，也有三百八十二打没变质。青岛站及厂方当然不会同意对方的这种作法，于是扯皮开始了。从1956年1月10日平地泉将电池发回起，直拖至10月16日才算把问题“解决”了。但电池是一种有时效的商品，一般储存期为六至十个月。因而问题虽然是“解决”了，但由于在九个月零六天的扯皮过程中，双方对这批电池均坐视不理，听其失效，结果给国家制造了三千九百九十六元七角六分的报废损失。
    又如，华东供销合作社上海日用杂品站，将与合同规定不符的打汽筒二百打发给了青岛百货批发站，经过双方一再交涉，并曾抄报了中华全国供销合作总社，及中国百货公司等中央机关进行仲裁，也牵连了青岛市商业局等行政领导部门，自1955年二季度开始，直拖了一年才算“解决”。在这漫长的“交涉”阶段，打汽筒生锈了，仅修理费即付出了六百多元。
    类似事例，在各地的企业单位中并不少见。你说这些同志不懂得爱护国家资财吗？不对！请看他们在双方扯皮交涉过程中，互相的警告和批评多么尖锐：“你单位这种无视国家资财遭受重大损失的工作作风，是令人难以容忍的。”“为避免国家资财继续遭受更大损失，请迅作处理”……这是多么明大义、顾国家呵！可惜的是，这些同志对于“国家资财”的理解过于狭隘和片面了。在他们的概念中，只有由他自己或本单位负责的物资才算是“国家资财”；只要是“责任属于对方”，“一切损失概由对方负责”，那怕是价值万元，数有千斤，损失了也与己无关。
    我们并不反对对这类问题查清责任，给那些确实不负责任或不严肃执行合同者以应得的批评或处分。但在交涉问题的同时，首先应该想到的是：不要再让国家资财的损失继续扩大下去。一面严肃地查清责任，一面尽可能迅速对已造成的损失进行抢救（不管责任属谁），这才是对的。如果只热衷于扯皮和追查责任，对国家资财采取不闻不问的态度，看起来他好像是一个维护国家利益和责任心很强的战士，实质上正是一个损坏国家财产和极不负责任的人！
