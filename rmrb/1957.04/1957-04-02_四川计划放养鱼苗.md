Xinhua News Agency report: Agricultural cooperatives and state-owned fish farms in various areas along the river in Sichuan Province have already established thousands of "breeding grounds" in places where fish habitually spawn, awaiting the spawning of parent fish. In the Jiangjin and Luzhou areas, people have already taken back the first batch of fish nests full of eggs from the river and put them into rice fields and ponds for incubation. According to the plan, more than 100 million fish fry such as carp, grass carp, and silver carp will be released throughout the province this spring, an increase of about 10% compared to last year.

Currently, more than 100 counties in Sichuan Province are engaged in fish farming. Last year, farmers in the Wanxian area released more than 7.7 million fish fry in more than 40,000 mu of ponds and rice fields, resulting in a total income of more than 850,000 yuan. Therefore, many agricultural cooperatives with suitable conditions are treating fish farming as an important sideline this year.

    四川计划放养鱼苗
    据新华社讯　四川省沿江各地农业社和国营鱼场已经在鱼类惯常产卵的地方建立起成千个“产场”，等待亲鱼产卵。在江津、沪州等专区，人们已经从河里取回第一批满盛鱼卵的鱼窠，放入稻田和池塘中孵化。根据计划，今春全省将要放养鲤鱼、草鱼、鲢鱼等鱼苗一亿多尾，约比去年增加一成。
    目前，四川省已经有一百多个县养鱼。万县专区农民去年在四万多亩面积的水塘和稻田里放养七百多万尾鱼苗，结果共收入了八十五万多元。因此，许多有条件的农业社，今年都把养鱼作为一项重要的副业。
