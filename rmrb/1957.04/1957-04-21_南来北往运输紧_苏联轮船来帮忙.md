Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 19th - A Soviet cargo ship arrived in Shanghai on the 18th. It will sail between Shanghai and Dalian for a period of time to transport goods for our country.

This 10,000-ton vessel, called the "Nakhodka," was sent by the Soviet shipping department at the request of our Ministry of Communications. Prior to this, the Soviet Union had already sent seven ships, which are now sailing on the Shanghai-Dalian sea route to transport goods for our country.

Due to the rapid increase in Shanghai's cargo volume, our country's cargo ships have been unable to keep up with transportation demands. In the first four and a half months of this year, Soviet ships have already transported more than 240,000 tons of goods for Shanghai. They transported iron ore concentrated in Shanghai from Anhui, Zhejiang and other places to Anshan Iron and Steel, shipped out daily necessities from Shanghai, and transported a large amount of coal from the Northeast to Shanghai.

    南来北往运输紧  苏联轮船来帮忙
    新华社上海19日电　一艘苏联货轮18日来到上海，它在以后一个时期内将航行于上海、大连之间，为我国运输货物。
    这艘叫“纳霍第卡号”的万吨轮船，是苏联航运部门应我国交通部的请求派来的。在这以前，苏联已经派来了七艘轮船，现在正在上海—大连海运线上航行，为我国运输货物。
    由于上海的货运量的迅速增加，我国货轮已经来不及运输。在今年的前四个半月里，苏联轮船已经为上海运输了二十四万多吨货物。它们把安徽、浙江等地集中到上海的铁矿石运往鞍钢，并从上海运出日用百货，从东北给上海运来大量煤炭。
