    Remembering Yuhuatai in Nanjing Before Qingming Festival
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Wei Wenhua
    Before Qingming, the hills of the Yuhuatai Martyrs' Cemetery in Nanjing are covered with evergreen pines and cypresses, and plum blossoms are in full bloom. People come to pay their respects to the martyrs in an endless stream every day. This year, Qingming Festival is in April. April in Nanjing is extraordinary. After the Kuomintang reactionaries fired the first shot of counter-revolution on April 12, 1927, Nanjing became a city of terror, and Yuhuatai became the main execution ground for revolutionary martyrs. Over twenty-two years, 100,000 martyrs shed their blood and gave their lives here heroically. Until April 22, 1949, before the Kuomintang fled Nanjing, they committed one last massacre on April 1, launching a slaughter of patriotic and democratic youth from eleven universities and colleges, injuring more than 200 students, and resulting in the deaths and disappearances of seventeen students.
    During the Kuomintang's rule in Nanjing, "going to Yuhuatai" was synonymous with death. The mountain gully below the northern slope of the main peak and the southwestern and southeastern gullies were all places where revolutionary martyrs were massacred at that time. According to Zhang Hongru, a sixty-one-year-old man who participated in burying the bodies at the time and is still alive, whenever the Kuomintang police cordoned off the hills, people knew that people were going to be killed, sometimes as few as five or six people, and sometimes as many as seventy-two people were killed at once. At first, they killed openly, and later they killed secretly, some were secretly buried alive.
    The vast majority of the martyrs who died at Yuhuatai were secretly executed by the enemy. Some, in order to avoid implicating relatives and friends, firmly refused to confess anything to the enemy. They were all nameless heroes who sleep underground. Only a very few well-known revolutionary leaders and martyrs whose cases were made public were known to people. All the martyrs were resolute and tenacious, until they shed their last drop of blood. Comrade Deng Zhongxia, a leader of the workers' movement who died at Yuhuatai in 1933, was personally lobbied by an important Kuomintang figure while in prison, who tried to lure the martyr with "freedom." The martyr said: "Before I came in, I thought that one day I would come in, but now that I have come in, I have never thought of going out!" Before his execution, he left a letter to his comrades saying: "I am going to Yuhuatai soon, you continue to work hard and fight, and the final victory will ultimately belong to us!" After the female martyr Guo Ganglin was arrested in 1933, she spent four years in prison. The enemy used all kinds of torture and deception, and tied her to the execution ground to accompany the execution, but none of this made the martyr yield. The embroidery she made in prison read "Struggle for Truth." After the War of Resistance Against Japan began in 1937, the enemy finally deceived her by saying: "The Communist Party has all surrendered, and you should also repent!" The martyr refuted the enemy and said: "There are only Kuomintang who surrender to Japanese imperialism in the world, and there has never been a Communist Party who surrenders to the Kuomintang, stop dreaming!" The enemy tied him to Yuhuatai, and the martyr sang the Internationale loudly and died generously with a laugh. Nine pieces of relics from the martyr, including a letter she wrote to her brother from prison and the embroidery she made, are now displayed in the Yuhuatai Martyrs' Relics Exhibition Hall, along with her portrait, for people to admire forever. In the Relics Exhibition Hall, a part of the martyrs' portraits, relics, last letters, blood-stained clothes, etc. have now been collected, and will be open to the public from this year's Qingming Festival. In the exhibition hall, there is also Chairman Mao's inscription: "Communism is irresistible! A single spark can start a prairie fire! Long live the martyred heroes!"
    Yuhuatai was originally a scenic spot in history, with many beautiful legends. According to legend, during the Southern and Northern Dynasties, a high-ranking monk named Master Yunguang gave lectures here, and flowers fell from the sky like rain, hence the name Yuhuatai. The Song Dynasty poet Lu You drank tea here and rated the spring water as the second best in Jiangnan. Since then, the spring water here has been named the Second Spring in Jiangnan. The hills are rich in colorful stones, called Yuhua stones, which have been famous since ancient times. It was not until the Kuomintang era that it was turned into a desolate and gloomy graveyard, causing pedestrians to hesitate. After liberation, starting in 1950, the People's Government turned the area into the Yuhuatai Martyrs' Cemetery, and constructed it year by year. Now, the 16,800-mu cemetery has been afforested. A memorial square has been opened on the main peak, and a large monument has been erected on the square, with Chairman Mao's inscription: "Long live the martyred heroes!" Memorial archways have been erected in the three mountain gullies where the most martyrs were martyred, and flower beds have been cultivated and pines and cypresses have been planted. The dilapidated temples in the valley have been repainted and are temporarily used as places to display the relics of the martyrs. The Second Spring in Jiangnan, which used to have only a few broken thatched houses next to it, has been covered and protected, and other historical sites have been repaired and protected.
    Every year, people come to Yuhuatai to pay their respects all year round, totaling 100,000 to 200,000 people. In addition to people from Nanjing, there have also been representatives from all over the country, from all ethnic groups, overseas Chinese, and friends from all over the world over the years. Since the end of March this year, the number of people coming to Yuhuatai to pay their respects to the martyrs has been increasing day by day, with a minimum of several thousand people and a maximum of tens of thousands of people per day. Many residents bring their families, young and old, to pay their respects to the martyrdom sites of the martyrs and admire the martyrs' photos and portraits.

### 清明前凭吊南京雨花台

    清明前凭吊南京雨花台
    新华社记者　魏文华
    清明前，南京雨花台烈士陵园的山岗上，松柏凝绿，梅花盛开。来凭吊烈士的人，每天络绎不绝。今年清明节在4月。南京的4月，是不平凡的。1927年4月12日国民党反动派放响反革命第一枪以后，南京就成为恐怖之城，雨花台成为残杀革命志士的主要刑场，二十二年间有十万烈士在这里抛头颅，洒热血，英勇就义。直到1949年4月22日国民党逃出南京前，还在4月1日制造了最后一次大血案，对十一个大学和专科学校的爱国民主青年发动屠杀，伤害学生二百多人，死亡和失踪的学生十七人。
    在国民党统治南京期间，“到雨花台去”是死亡的代名词。在山岗主峰北坡下面山坳和西南、东南两个山坳，都是当时屠杀革命志士的场所。据当时参加过埋尸如今还活着的一位六十一岁老人张鸿如说，每当国民党警察在山岗周围戒严，这时人们就知道要杀人了，一批少则五、六人，多的一次曾同时杀过七十二人。起初是公开地杀，后来就秘密杀，有的就偷偷地活埋。
    在雨花台牺牲的烈士，极大多数是被敌人秘密处死，有的为避免牵连亲友，在敌人面前坚不吐实，他们都是无名英雄长眠地下。只有极少数知名的革命领袖和案情公开的烈士，被人知道。所有的烈士都是坚决顽强，直到洒出最后一滴血。1933年牺牲在雨花台的工人运动领袖邓中夏同志，在狱中时国民党一个要人亲自去向他游说，以“自由”来诱骗烈士，烈士说：“我未进来前想到有一天会进来，现在进来了倒从未想到会出去！”就义前，留下遗书给同志们说：“我快要到雨花台去了，你们继续努力奋斗吧，最后胜利终究是属于我们的！”女烈士郭纲琳1933年被捕后，在监牢四年，敌人用尽酷刑和欺骗，绑她到刑场陪刑，都未使烈士屈服。她在狱中所作刺绣“为真理而奋斗”。1937年抗战开始后，敌人最后骗她说：“共产党全投降了，你也该悔悟了！”烈士驳斥敌人说：“世上只有向日本帝国主义投降的国民党，从来没有向国民党投降的共产党，你少说梦话吧！”敌人绑他到雨花台，烈士高唱国际歌，大笑着慷慨就义。烈士从狱中写给哥哥的信和所作的刺绣等遗物九件，现在都陈列在雨花台烈士遗物陈列室，和她的遗像在一起，永远供人瞻仰。在遗物陈列室中，现在已经征集到一部分烈士的遗照、遗物、绝笔书、血衣等，从今年清明节开始对外开放。在陈列室中还有毛主席的题字：“共产主义是不可抗御的！星星之火可以燎原！死难烈士万岁！”
    雨花台这个地方，在历史上本是一个胜地，有许多美丽的传说。相传南北朝时，梁朝有位高僧云光法师在这里讲经说法，天上落花如雨，自此被名为雨花台。宋朝诗人陆放翁在这里饮过茶，品泉水为江南第二，此后这里的泉水即被名为江南第二泉。山岗盛产五彩石，称雨花石，自古就很有名。到了国民党时代，才使这里变成一个荒漠、阴惨的坟岗，行人为之裹足。解放以后从1950年开始，人民政府把这里辟为雨花台烈士陵园，逐年建设，到现在已经使一万六千八百多亩的陵园绿化。在主峰上，辟出了一块纪念广场，在广场上立了一面大碑，碑上有毛主席题字：“死难烈士万岁！”在原来烈士殉难最多的三个山坳，都立有纪念牌坊，培育花坛，栽植了松柏。山谷里原来破败的庙宇已经被粉刷一新，暂时作为陈列烈士遗物的场所。过去旁边只有几间破茅草屋的江南第二泉，已被加盖保护，其他古迹也都已经修理和得到保护。
    每年到雨花台来凭吊的人，四季不断，总有一、二十万人。除了南京市的人以外，历年来还有来自全国各地、各民族和华侨的代表，有来自世界五大洲各国的友人。今年从3月底以来，到雨花台来凭吊烈士的人逐日增多，每天少则几千人，多的上万人。许多居民扶老携幼来这里凭吊烈士殉难处，瞻仰烈士照片遗容。
