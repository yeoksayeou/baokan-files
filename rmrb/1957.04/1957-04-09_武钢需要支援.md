Wuhan Iron and Steel Needs Support
By our reporter Cao Baoming

Twice, I specifically took a car to visit the Wuhan Iron and Steel (WISCO) construction site. Each time, I spent an afternoon there, and neither time did I manage to see the whole site. It made me think: to build so many huge structures on such a vast site, and to produce steel according to the designed scale, how much material and equipment would be needed! The WISCO construction site provided some data: in this year alone—the first year of formal construction—they need 85,000 tons of construction steel and the installation and storage of 37,000 tons of production equipment. This number is much larger than the total weight of the steel beams of the Yangtze River Bridge. Obviously, to build such a steel base, it cannot be accomplished solely by the tens of thousands of people directly involved in the construction of WISCO; it must rely on nationwide support.

Recently, the state decided to put WISCO's No. 1 blast furnace into production half a year ahead of schedule, by the end of next year. Corresponding to this task, five major projects (including the No. 1 blast furnace, coking and chemical engineering, refractory materials, ore dressing, and sintering plant) will commence construction one after another this year. Its scale is even larger than the construction of the three major projects of Anshan Iron and Steel. There are many difficulties in equipment, materials, construction organization, production preparation, and living supplies. The two most prominent difficulties are: First, the material problem. For the second quarter of this year, the state has allocated 5,600 tons of round steel for the project, but as of early April, 4,600 tons of it had not yet been ordered, and it is not known which factory will produce it or when it can be delivered. Second, the equipment problem. Of the 37,000 tons of production equipment they need to install and store this year, more than 26,000 tons are to be manufactured domestically. Among them, major equipment such as blast furnace gas burners, furnace top bells, and furnace top linings require high technical skills, and it will take a long time to manufacture them after trial production. However, much of this major equipment has not yet been ordered. If these problems cannot be resolved quickly, it will inevitably affect the progress of WISCO's construction.

So, what kind of support are various parties providing to WISCO? In the construction of WISCO, many units have made great efforts. The Wuhan City Transportation Company has a total of about 400 vehicles, and it has allocated more than 180 of them specifically to transport materials at the WISCO construction site; Daye Steel Plant always tries to deliver orders ahead of schedule to meet the needs of WISCO's project; the logistics department of the Wuhan garrison lent WISCO thousands of tons of cement; in addition, many local building materials units and living supply units in Hubei Province and Wuhan City, as well as some manufacturing factories in Shanghai, have provided great assistance to WISCO. However, compared with the past support for the three major projects of Anshan Iron and Steel and the Yangtze River Bridge, the current support from various parties for WISCO is still far from adequate, and even a few units have created some artificial difficulties for WISCO.

Relevant departments of WISCO talked about the following examples.

Many large gate valves for WISCO's water supply project are manufactured domestically. WISCO's No. 4 pumping station will start supplying water in May this year to serve the construction of the main plant, and it is urgently needed. It was requested that the First Ministry of Machine Building undertake the task of manufacturing this batch of equipment. The First Ministry of Machine Building assigned this task to the Third Bureau, which in turn assigned it to the local state-owned Anshan No. 1 Machinery Factory, because these equipment are very large, and this factory does not have the manufacturing conditions. Later, personnel from the WISCO Equipment Department traveled all over Anshan, Shenyang, Beijing, and other places, and finally found the Chengfa Gate Valve Factory in Shenyang. Unexpectedly, this factory raised many conditions, and after a long period of negotiation, the contract was signed on March 7 this year. Obviously, these gate valves can no longer be used according to the original plan.

WISCO needs more than 2 million bamboo poles this year to replace wooden templates and part of the steel bars. Last year, WISCO sent people to Hunan to order 300,000 bamboo poles. At that time, the Hunan Provincial Bamboo Industry Office did not allow them to leave the province. After several negotiations, they agreed to transport 120,000 bamboo poles this year. However, when they were transported from Hengyang, the Hengyang Bamboo Industry Station sent people to cut the cables of their bamboo rafts, scattering 20,000 bamboo poles. WISCO's purchasing staff filed a lawsuit with the People's Court on the spot, and the matter has not yet been resolved.

In addition, some units, in their dealings with WISCO, always think that WISCO is a large unit and want to take advantage of WISCO in every way, causing losses to the state. WISCO ordered coking oven doors from the Shanxi Machinery Factory, which only required 1,200 tons of pig iron raw materials. Even with a wastage rate of 25%, it would only require 1,500 tons, and WISCO agreed to supply all of this batch of pig iron. However, the factory asked WISCO to supply 2,200 tons of pig iron. After repeated negotiations, it was agreed to reduce it to 2,000 tons. In this way, this factory obtained 500 tons more pig iron from the state through WISCO's hands.

There are many reasons for these situations. Some belong to capitalist management thinking, some belong to irresponsible and overbearing practices, but a more common reason is that the past propaganda was insufficient, and many people do not fully understand the great significance of building WISCO.

Now, the state, based on needs and possible conditions, has placed WISCO in the first place in the construction of China's three major steel bases, as the "focus of the focus," and requires WISCO's No. 1 blast furnace to be put into production ahead of schedule. This requires all parties to further recognize the great significance of building WISCO in changing China's economic outlook and its huge role in promoting China's socialist industrialization, and then actively support the construction of this new steel base.

There are many difficulties in providing good support to WISCO. First of all, the number of key projects under construction at the same time is much larger than during the construction of the three major projects of Anshan Iron and Steel, which increases the manufacturing tasks of China's existing factories. Secondly, WISCO itself needs a large quantity of materials, often requiring thousands or tens of thousands of tons of materials at a time, making it difficult for many small units to meet their requirements even with all their efforts. Once they are no longer needed, the materials prepared by these units will be heavily stockpiled and cannot be sold. At the same time, WISCO's project is ahead of schedule, but foreign design drawings cannot keep up. Often, as soon as the drawings arrive, the manufacturing factories are required to rush to produce and deliver the goods ahead of schedule, which is also very difficult. This requires the relevant state departments to do a good job in classifying and ranking when allocating materials and equipment (including some materials not subject to state allocation), so that the materials and equipment needed for key projects like WISCO can be guaranteed in terms of quantity, time, and quality. At the same time, WISCO's employees also need to further change their past attitude of "sitting and waiting for support," actively strengthen contact with all parties, and try to strengthen the planning of their work to reduce the burden on the supporting units. More importantly, all parties across the country should take the task of supporting WISCO on their own initiative, actively overcome the difficulties in providing support, and work together to ensure that this new steel base can be completed on schedule.

Let us repeat: Wuhan Iron and Steel needs support!

### 武钢需要支援

    武钢需要支援
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    有两次，我专门乘了汽车去看武钢工地，每次转了一个下午，哪次也没将工地转遍。我想：要在这样辽阔的场地上建起许多巨大建筑，并按照设计的规模生产钢铁，得用多少材料和多少设备啊！武钢工地给了一份资料：在今年——正式施工的第一年里，就需用八万五千吨建筑钢材，安装和储备三万七千吨生产设备。这个数字，比长江大桥的钢梁总重量大得多。很显然，要建成这样一个钢铁基地，绝不是光靠直接参与武钢建设的几万人所能完成的，必须依靠全国支援。
    最近，国家又决定武钢第一号高炉提前半年在明年年底投入生产。同这个任务相适应的有五大工程（包括第一号高炉、炼焦化工、耐火材料、选矿、烧结厂）将在今年陆续动工兴建，它的规模比鞍钢三大工程建设还大。在设备、材料、施工组织、生产准备和生活供应方面，都存在着许多困难。最突出的困难有两个。一是材料问题。今年第二季度的工程，已由国家分配了五千六百吨元钢，但其中有四千六百吨到4月初还未订下货来，不知道归哪个厂生产，何时能交货。二是设备问题。他们今年需要安装和储备的三万七千吨生产设备中，有二万六千多吨是在国内制造。其中像高炉瓦斯燃烧器、炉顶大钟、炉顶衬板等重大设备，技术要求很高，经过试制，要很长时间才能制造出来。但是，这许多重大设备至今还未订下货来。如果这些问题不能迅速解决，势必影响武钢的建设进度。
    那末，各方面对武钢的支援怎样呢？在武钢建设中，有不少的单位作了很大的努力。武汉市运输公司总共有四百来辆汽车，就抽出了一百八十多辆专门在武钢工地运送材料；大冶钢厂总是尽量提前交付订货，以适应武钢工程需要；武汉驻军后勤部门借给武钢上千吨的水泥；另外，湖北省、武汉市许多地方建筑材料单位、生活供应单位和上海一些制造工厂，都给以武钢很大的帮助。但是，要同过去支援鞍钢三大工程，支援长江大桥的情况比起来，目前各方面对武钢的支援还很不够，甚至还有少数单位给武钢造成了若干人为的困难。
    武钢有关部门谈了这样几个例子。
    武钢供水工程的许多大闸阀都在国内制造。武钢四号水泵站今年5月就要开始供水，为主厂房施工服务，需用甚急，要求第一机械工业部担负起这批设备的制造任务。第一机械工业部把这项任务交三局办理，三局又将这任务交给地方国营鞍山第一机械厂，因为这些设备的体积很大，这个厂没有制造条件。后来武钢设备处的人员跑遍了鞍山、沈阳、北京等地，才在沈阳找到成发闸阀厂，不料这个厂提了很多条件，磋商很久，到今年3月7日才签了合同。很显然，这些闸阀已经不能按原计划使用。
    武钢今年需用二百多万根竹子以代替木模板和部分钢筋。去年，武钢派人到湖南订购了竹子三十万根。当时，湖南省竹业处不让出境。经过几番交涉，才同意今年运出十二万根。但是，当他们从衡阳运出时，衡阳竹业站又派人把他们的竹排缆子砍断，放散了两万根。武钢采购员就地向人民法院起诉，事情还未解决。
    另外，有些单位在同武钢交往中，总以为武钢是个大单位，处处想占武钢便宜，使国家遭受损失。武钢向山西机器厂订购炼焦炉炉门，只需生铁原料一千二百吨，再加上25％的损耗率，也只需一千五百吨就行了，武钢也答应全部供给这批生铁。但是，这个厂开口就要武钢供给二千二百吨生铁。经过多次交涉，减到二千吨才达成协议。这样，这个厂就通过武钢之手，向国家多要了五百吨生铁。
    造成这些情况的原因很多。有的属于资本主义经营思想，有的属于不负责任和横蛮作风，但更普遍的一个原因，就是过去宣传不够，许多人对建设武钢的重大意义认识不足。
    现在，国家根据需要和可能条件，已将武钢列在我国三大钢铁基地建设的第一位，作为“重点的重点”，并且要求武钢一号高炉提前投入生产。这就需要各方面进一步认识建设武钢在改变我国经济面貌的重大意义，在促进我国社会主义工业化的巨大作用，进而主动积极支援这个新的钢铁基地的建设。
    要作好对武钢的支援，是有许多困难的。首先是目前同时施工的重点工程，比建设鞍钢三大工程时期多得多，这就加重了我国现有工厂的制造任务。其次是武钢本身需要的物资数量很大，往往一旦需要什么材料就是成千上万吨，使许多小单位竭尽全力也很难满足他们要求，一旦不要了，就使这些单位准备的物资大量积压，销不出去。同时，武钢工程提前，而国外设计图纸赶不及，往往图纸一到就要求承制工厂赶快生产，提前交货，困难也很大。这就需要国家有关部门，在分配物资、设备（包括一些不属国家调拨的物资在内）时，作好分类排队工作，使武钢这样的重点工程所需的物资、设备，能在数量、时间、质量上确有保证。同时，也需要武钢职工进一步改变过去那种“坐等支援”的态度，主动同各方面加强联系，并尽量加强工作的计划性，减轻支援单位的负担。更重要的，则是全国各个方面把支援武钢的任务主动承担起来，积极克服支援中的困难，为确保武钢这个新的钢铁基地能按期建成而共同努力。
    让我们重复一遍：武钢需要支援！
