Suggestions
    Custom Tailoring Should Leave Room for Alterations
    Return Scrap Fabric to Customers for Patching
    Teenagers grow very quickly, and often clothes that fit well become too short and too tight in less than half a year. When I make clothes for my children, I always ask the clothing store to leave a little extra fabric inside when cutting the clothes, so that they can be let out and worn again as the child grows. However, this request is often not adopted, and as a result, my daughter has several clothes every year that can no longer be worn even though they are not broken, so I have to make new clothes.
    Every piece of clothing often has places that are particularly easy to tear, such as collars and cuffs. If the clothing processing department returns all the scrap fabric left over from cutting clothes to the customers, the customers can replace the collar or cuffs when the clothes are torn and wear them again. But as far as I know, clothing departments rarely have this habit. A few days ago, my husband had a jacket made at the 52nd Sewing Cooperative on Chongnei Street in Beijing. He bought nine and a half feet of fabric and gave it to them. When he picked up the clothes, he found that the sleeves were a little short, so we asked them to let out the hem and attach two strips of facing. They actually said that they didn't even have a little facing fabric left.
    Some clothing stores like to overestimate the amount of fabric needed for customers. A few days ago, I also asked the 52nd Sewing Cooperative on Chongnei Street to measure how many feet of fabric my daughter would need to make a shirt. The salesperson casually said that she would need seven feet. Later, when we went to buy the fabric, the salesperson calculated it and told us to buy only six and a half feet, and it was still enough.　　　Wen Yu

    建议
    量体裁衣还要留后路
    碎布交还顾客打补丁
    十几岁的孩子长得特别快，往往挺合身的衣服，不到半年就太短太瘦了。我给孩子做衣服的时候，总是要求服装店在裁衣服时多留一点布在里面，以备孩子长了以后放出来继续穿。但是这种要求往往没有被采纳，结果我女儿每年总有几件还没破的衣服不能再穿了，这就不得不重做新衣。
    每件衣服往往都有特别容易破的地方，如衣领、袖口等，如果服装加工部门把裁剪衣服剩下的碎布都交还顾客的话，顾客就可以在衣服破了的时候换个领子、袖口再穿。但是据我所知，目前服装部门还很少有这种习惯。前几天我爱人在北京崇内大街第五十二缝纫社做件上衣，买了九尺五寸布交给他们，取衣服时发现袖子稍短一些，我们就请他们把边放出来，再接上两条贴边，他们居然说连一点贴边的布都没有了。
    有的服装店给顾客计算布料时，总是喜欢多算一些。前几天我也是请崇内大街第五十二缝纫社给我的女儿量一下做件衬衣要买几尺布，业务员顺口就说要七尺。后来我们去买布时，售货员算来算去，让我们只买六尺五寸，结果还是够了。　　　温　雨
