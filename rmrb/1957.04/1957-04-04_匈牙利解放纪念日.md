Hungarian Liberation Anniversary

This year, April 4th marks the twelfth anniversary of the liberation of Hungary.

Twelve years ago on this day, the heroic Soviet army drove the fascist Hitlerite troops from all Hungarian territory, liberating Hungary and enabling the Hungarian people to embark on the free, democratic, and independent socialist path. In 1950, the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic decided to designate this day of liberation as National Day.

More than one thousand and sixty years ago, the Hungarian nation settled on the Tisza-Danube Plain and established an independent Kingdom of Hungary in the year 1000 AD. Due to infighting within the feudal ruling class, Hungary lost its national independence for a considerable period of time beginning in the sixteenth century. For hundreds of years, freedom- and independence-loving Hungarian people waged unyielding and heroic struggles against Turkish, Austrian, and other foreign invaders to win national liberation and democratic freedom. After the First World War, the Austro-Hungarian Empire disintegrated, and Hungary regained its national autonomy in the autumn of 1818, establishing a bourgeois republic. Under the influence of the October Revolution, Hungary experienced its first proletarian revolution in March 1919, establishing a Soviet Republic. However, this workers' regime was soon strangled by imperialism and domestic counter-revolutionary forces. At the end of 1919, the monarchy, headed by a regent, was restored, plunging Hungary into the dark period of Horthy's fascist dictatorship.

During the Second World War, Horthy turned Hungary into a vassal of Nazi Germany, involving it in a criminal war of aggression, which brought profound national disasters to Hungary. Under the leadership of the Hungarian Communist Party, the Hungarian people launched an arduous struggle against fascist Germany and Horthy's reactionary rule. In the summer of 1944, a widespread guerrilla war was launched, inflicting serious blows on the invaders throughout Hungary. In early October 1944, the Soviet army pursued Hitler's troops and entered Hungarian territory. In the land liberated by the Soviet army, the Hungarian Communist Party led the people in carrying out tremendous work for democratic development and economic reconstruction. In December 1944, the Provisional National Assembly of Hungary convened its first meeting in the then-liberated city of Debrecen, forming a provisional national government and ending Horthy's twenty-five years of reactionary rule. The provisional government then declared war on Hitler's Germany and signed an armistice agreement with the Soviet Union, the United States, and Great Britain. Under the heroic action of the Soviet army, the capital Budapest was liberated on February 13, 1945, and on April 4 of the same year, the Soviet army drove all the fascist occupiers out of Hungarian territory. After liberation, the Hungarian people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, implemented land reform and the nationalization of industry, leading Hungary from capitalism and feudalism onto the path of socialist development.

Due to the destruction of the Second World War, Hungary lost 45% of its national wealth, and industrial productivity fell to 30% to 35%. At the time of liberation, only 10% of the factories were able to operate normally. More than 20% of agriculture was destroyed. However, the liberated Hungarian working people, with the fraternal and enormous assistance of the Soviet Union, not only healed the wounds of war but also further developed the national economy. By 1955, Hungary's industrial output had increased to three and a half times its pre-war level, and the output of various major industrial products had exceeded several times their highest pre-war levels. Hungary has developed from a pre-war agricultural country into an industrial-agricultural country.

Between last October and November, the Hungarian counter-revolutionary forces, under the instigation of the imperialist aggressive bloc, took advantage of the Hungarian people's demands to correct the mistakes made by the former leaders and launched a frenzied counter-revolutionary armed rebellion, attempting to undermine the achievements of Hungary's socialist construction and ultimately overthrow the Hungarian People's Republic. The Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, with the righteous assistance of the Soviet army, crushed the counter-revolutionary rebellion, defending the freedom, independence, and socialist system of the Hungarian people. In recent months, under leadership of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, the people of Hungary have gradually restored normal life and have taken various measures to strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat and expand people's democracy. In the work of economic recovery, the Hungarian people have received enormous fraternal assistance from the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. On the basis of proletarian internationalism and national equality, the fraternal friendship between Hungary and the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union has been further consolidated and strengthened.

Today, it is of great significance that the Hungarian people commemorate their National Day—the twelfth anniversary of the liberation of Hungary.

### 匈牙利解放纪念日

    匈牙利解放纪念日
    今年4月4日，是匈牙利解放十二周年纪念日。
    十二年前的这一天，英勇的苏联军队从匈牙利全部领土上驱逐了法西斯希特勒的军队，解放了匈牙利，从而使匈牙利人民走上了自由、民主、独立的社会主义道路。1950年匈牙利人民共和国主席团决定将这一解放日定为国庆节。
    早在一千零六十多年前，匈牙利民族便在蒂萨河—多瑙河平原定居下来，并于公元一千年时建立了独立的匈牙利王国。由于封建统治集团内部的倾轧，匈牙利从十六世纪开始在一个相当长的时期里丧失了民族独立。爱好自由和独立的匈牙利人民几百年来为争取民族解放和民主自由，向土耳其、奥地利以及其他外国侵略者进行了不屈不挠的英勇斗争。在第一次世界大战后，奥匈帝国宣告瓦解，匈牙利在1818年秋恢复了国家的自主，成立了资产阶级的共和国。在十月革命的影响下，1919年3月匈牙利发生了第一次无产阶级革命，成立了苏维埃共和国。但这个工人政权不久便被帝国主义和国内反革命势力所扼杀。1919年末，以摄政为首的君主政权复辟，使匈牙利进入霍尔蒂法西斯独裁的黑暗时期。
    在第二次世界大战期间，霍尔蒂把匈牙利变为纳粹德国的附庸，卷入了罪恶的侵略战争，从而给匈牙利带来了深重的民族灾难。在匈牙利共产党的领导下，匈牙利人民展开了反对法西斯德国和霍尔蒂反动统治的艰苦斗争。1944年夏，更掀起了广泛的游击战争，在匈牙利境内到处给侵略者以严重打击。1944年10月初，苏联军队追击希特勒军队而进入匈牙利国境。在苏军解放的土地上，匈牙利共产党领导人民为民主发展和经济复兴而进行了巨大的工作。1944年12月，在当时已获解放的得布勒森市召开的匈牙利临时国民议会第一次会议上，组成了临时国民政府，结束了霍尔蒂二十五年的反动统治。临时政府接着便向希特勒德国宣战，并和苏、美、英签订停战协定。在苏军英勇行动下，首都布达佩斯于1945年
  2月13日获得解放，同年4月4日苏军把法西斯占领者全部赶出了匈牙利国土。解放后，匈牙利人民在共产党领导下实行了土地改革和工业国有化，使匈牙利从资本主义和封建制度走上了社会主义社会的发展道路。
    由于第二次世界大战的破坏，匈牙利的国家财富丧失了45％，工业生产力降低到30％到35％，解放时只有10％的工厂能够进行正常生产。20％以上的农业遭到破坏。但是解放了的匈牙利劳动人民在苏联兄弟般的巨大援助下，不仅医治了战争创伤，而且使国民经济获得进一步的发展。1955年匈牙利的工业产量已增加到战前水平的三倍半，各种主要工业品的产量都已超过战前最高产量的数倍以上。匈牙利已经从战前的一个农业国发展成为一个工业——农业国家。
    去年10月和11月间，在帝国主义侵略集团指使下的匈牙利反革命势力，利用匈牙利人民要求纠正前领导所犯错误的机会，发动了疯狂的反革命武装暴乱，企图破坏匈牙利社会主义建设成果和最后颠复匈牙利人民共和国。匈牙利工农革命政府在苏联军队的正义援助下，粉碎了反革命暴乱，保卫住了匈牙利人民的自由、独立和社会主义制度。几个月来，匈牙利人民在社会主义工人党和工农革命政府的领导下，逐步地恢复了正常生活，并采取了加强无产阶级专政、扩大人民民主等各项措施。匈牙利人民在恢复经济的工作中，得到了苏联和其他社会主义国家巨大的兄弟般的援助。在无产阶级国际主义精神和民族平等的基础上，匈牙利同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的兄弟友谊进一步巩固和加强了。
    今天，匈牙利人民纪念自己的国庆日——匈牙利解放十二周年纪念日具有重大的意义。
