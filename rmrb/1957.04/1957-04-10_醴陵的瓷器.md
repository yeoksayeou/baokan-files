    Liling Porcelain
    By Our Correspondent Gao Changren
    People all know that Jingdezhen in Jiangxi Province is China's famous porcelain production area, but not many people know about the porcelain from Liling in Hunan Province. In fact, the porcelain produced in Liling County is now sold in twenty-one provinces and cities. Since the second quarter of last year, a batch of daily-use porcelain has been exported and has been well received by foreign users. Liling has become one of China's important porcelain production areas; today, Liling's porcelain industry production, in terms of scale and quality, is second only to Jingdezhen. This year, it is planned to produce 120 million pieces of porcelain, including more than 8 million pieces for export.
    During the reign of Emperor Yongzheng of the Qing Dynasty, the production of coarse porcelain began here; the production of fine porcelain has only been around for more than fifty years. In the thirty-second year of the Guangxu reign, a machine-made porcelain factory was established through a joint venture between government and merchants, employing Japanese technicians and Jiangxi workers to specialize in the production of fine porcelain. From that time on, Liling's porcelain industry flourished, reaching its peak between 1939 and 1943. Some products received praise at international expositions in Panama, Italy, and other countries. Liling's earthen porcelain has always had good sales in Hunan, Hubei, and Henan. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Liling's fine porcelain was also sold in the six provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, Hubei, and Hunan. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, it was even sold to Hong Kong and various parts of Southeast Asia.
    During that period, although Liling porcelain had a wide sales market, it was not well-known. Originally, private merchants manufacturing porcelain at that time, in order to quickly find sales channels, also stamped Liling porcelain with the "Made in Jingdezhen, Jiangxi" label. Although people used Liling porcelain, they did not know that these porcelains were produced in Liling. Last year, a porcelain businessman in Hong Kong saw samples of Liling porcelain in Guangzhou and was very satisfied, but he did not believe that Liling could actually produce these good-quality porcelains. Therefore, he personally visited Liling and, after returning to Hong Kong, wrote to the Liling Porcelain Company, encouraging them to produce in large quantities. He said that overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia very much liked Liling porcelain. When I visited several porcelain factories in Liling, I saw with my own eyes that the export porcelain was stamped with the "Made in Liling, China" mark. Now, Liling porcelain relies on the quality of its own products to open up sales channels. The phenomenon of stealing the Jiangxi label has long gone forever.
    Currently, the Hunan Provincial Industrial Department's Liling Porcelain Company leads the county's porcelain production. This company leads twenty-six units with nearly ten thousand employees, and its 1956 output reached 194% of that in 1950. The company's total output value accounts for 80% of the total output value of the county's local industries. According to the Secretary of the Liling County Party Committee, nearly 200,000 people in the county are directly or indirectly dependent on porcelain production for their livelihoods.
    Liling's porcelain production has superior natural conditions. Raw materials such as porcelain clay, porcelain glaze, and refractory materials have abundant reserves; the raw material production areas are close to the factories, with the nearest being five li and the farthest being only fifty li. Transportation is also convenient, with the Lu River connecting to the Yuehan Railway by waterway; there are highways on land; and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is also close to the city.
    The porcelain workers here generally have more than seven years of work experience, and their production experience is rich. After liberation, production technology has greatly improved. The Porcelain Company has also specially established a Ceramic Research Institute, whose task is to research, improve, and enhance production technology, and to trial-produce new products. Wu Shouqi, a seventy-one-year-old pottery painter who is good at painting "underglaze flowers," also works at the Research Institute. Liling porcelain's "underglaze flowers" have always been famous. This old painter is now leading four apprentices, imparting his skills.
    According to statistics at the end of last year, Liling has a total of two hundred and forty-four varieties of daily-use porcelain. This year, many new products will also be trial-produced.
    Currently, the production of Liling daily-use porcelain is mostly done by hand, and production cannot be increased quickly. The Hunan Provincial Industrial Department's Liling Porcelain Company has already formulated a plan to gradually change the situation of manual operation and achieve semi-mechanized production. At the same time, it is preparing to gradually build new-style coal kilns to replace the current wood-fired kilns. The company's employees believe that before long, a large number of good-quality porcelains will be continuously shipped from here to all parts of the country.

### 醴陵的瓷器

    醴陵的瓷器
    本报记者　高长任
    人们都知道江西景德镇是我国著名的瓷器产地，提起湖南醴陵的瓷器来，知道的人就不很多。其实，醴陵县出产的瓷器，现在已经行销二十一个省、市；从去年第二季度起，有一批日用瓷出口，也受到国外用户的欢迎。醴陵，已经是我国重要的瓷器产地之一；今天醴陵的瓷业生产，在规模和质量方面，已经仅次于景德镇了。今年计划生产的瓷器有一亿二千万件。其中出口瓷有八百多万件。
    清代雍正年间，这里开始制造粗瓷；细瓷的生产，只有五十多年的历史。光绪三十二年，由官商合办，建立一个机器制瓷厂，聘有日本技师和江西技工，专门生产细瓷。从那时候起，醴陵的瓷业便蒸蒸日上，在1939到1943年间，更是盛极一时。有些产品，曾在巴拿马、意大利等国际博览会上获得好评。醴陵的土瓷，过去一直在湖南、湖北、河南有很好的销路。抗日战争期间，醴陵的细瓷又行销广东、广西、贵州、四川、湖北、湖南六省。抗战胜利以后，还一度行销到香港和南洋各地。
    在那个时期，醴陵瓷器虽然销路广阔，但是并不出名。原来，那时制造瓷器的私商，为了迅速找到销路，把醴陵的瓷器也打上江西景德镇出品的招牌。人们虽然使用了醴陵瓷器，却不知道这些瓷器出产在醴陵。去年，香港有一位经营瓷业的商人，在广州看到醴陵的瓷器样品很满意，但他不相信醴陵真正能生产这些质地良好的瓷器。于是，他亲自到醴陵参观了一番，回到香港以后，便写信给醴陵瓷业公司，鼓励他们大批生产。他说，南洋华侨很喜欢醴陵的瓷器。我在醴陵几个瓷厂参观的时候，亲眼看到出口瓷器上盖着“中国醴陵出品”的戳记。现在，醴陵瓷器就依靠自己的产品质量来打开销路。那种盗用江西招牌的现象早就一去不复返了。
    现在，领导全县瓷业生产的，是湖南省工业厅醴陵瓷业公司。这个公司领导二十六个单位，职工近一万人，1956年的产量，达到1950年的194％。这个公司的总产值，占全县地方工业总产值的80％。据中共醴陵县委书记谈，现在全县直接、间接靠瓷业生产生活的，近二十万人。
    醴陵的瓷业生产，有着优越的自然条件。瓷土、瓷釉、耐火材料等原料都有丰富的蕴藏量；原料产地距离工厂近的五里，远的也只有五十里。交通条件也方便，水路有一条渌江，联接粤汉铁路；陆上有公路；浙赣铁路也靠近城边。
    这里的瓷业工人大都有七年以上的工龄，生产经验是丰富的。解放以后，生产技术都有很大提高。瓷业公司还专门设有一个陶瓷研究所，任务是研究改进和提高生产技术，并试制新产品。有一位七十一岁的善于画“釉下花”的陶画师吴寿祺，也在研究所工作。醴陵瓷器的“釉下花”一向是著名的。这位老画师现在正带领四个徒弟，传授技术。
    据去年年底统计，醴陵日用瓷的品种共有二百四十四种。今年，还将试制许多新产品。
    现在醴陵日用瓷器的生产，绝大部分是手工操作，产量不能很快地增加。湖南省工业厅醴陵瓷业公司已经制订了一个规划，准备逐步改变手工操作的状况，做到半机械化生产。同时准备逐步建立新式煤窑，代替现在的柴窑。这个公司的职工们相信，不要很长的时间，大批质量良好的瓷器将会从这里源源运往各地。
