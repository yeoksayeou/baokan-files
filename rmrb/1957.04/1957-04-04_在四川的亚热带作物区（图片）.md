    The southern part of the Xichang Special District in Sichuan, along the river valleys of the Jinsha River, Yalong River, and the lower reaches of the Anning River, belongs to the subtropical crop area. This is the spring scenery of the subtropical region.
    The Hongxing Agricultural Cooperative in Huili County has eleven coffee trees, which will all be harvested this year for seed, in preparation for further promotion of planting.
    The cacti here are as tall as trees and can be used as fences for vegetable gardens and courtyards.
    Subtropical areas are suitable for planting double-season rice, and the yield is very high. This is a member of the agricultural cooperative inspecting double-season rice seedlings.
    The subtropical crop area is rich in papayas, one weighing two or three pounds. They taste fragrant and sweet, can be harvested all year round, and can be eaten raw or cooked as a dish.

    四川西昌专区南部，沿金沙江、雅砻江和安宁河下游的河谷地带，属亚热带作物区。这是亚热带地区春天的景色。
    会理县红星农业社有十一株咖啡树，今年将全部采下留种，准备进一步推广种植。
    这里的仙人掌高大如树，可作菜园、院落的围墙。
    亚热带适种双季稻，产量很高。这是农业社社员正在检查双季稻秧苗。
    亚热带作物区盛产蕃木瓜，一个有两三斤重。味道香而甜，常年可以采收，不但可以生食，也能炒熟做菜吃。
