Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, April 4th: Delayed news: Four boatmen from Fuqing County, Fujian Province, unarmed, annihilated two Chiang Kai-shek soldiers who came to rob them.

This incident occurred on the morning of March 18th. At the time, the Lin Daoqing transport boat from Jizhao Village, Fuqing County, was heading towards Fuzhou in heavy fog. When the boat was sailing near Zhanggang, Changle, a sea area, a motor sound suddenly came from the eastern sea, and then an unidentified motorboat emerged from the thick fog, rushing straight towards the transport boat. It was too late for the transport boat to turn its sails and adjust its direction. After the two boats approached each other, two people in plain clothes immediately jumped onto the transport boat. They pointed their guns and shouted at the boatmen: "Where are you going? What are you carrying?" The motorboat followed behind the transport boat, and also set up a machine gun on the bow of the boat. The boatmen immediately understood: This was a Chiang Kai-shek military robbery.

At that time, it was a southeast wind, and the transport boat sailed quickly towards the Minjiang River estuary. In the thick fog, the Chiang Kai-shek military motorboat followed for a while and then got lost in the sea of fog. The two Chiang Kai-shek soldiers on the transport boat turned their heads and could not see their boat, and immediately panicked. They pointed their guns and ordered the helmsman to sail the boat to Baiquan Island. The helmsman ignored them, and the bow of the boat was still facing the mainland. At this time, the Chiang Kai-shek soldiers became impatient and secretly discussed killing two boatmen, and then forcing the other two to sail the boat to Baiquan Island. However, the helmsman heard the words of the Chiang Kai-shek soldiers, and he cleverly winked at the other three boatmen. They immediately jumped up and hugged the two Chiang Kai-shek soldiers around the waist. The Chiang Kai-shek soldiers did not have time to shoot and were thrown into the sea. One of them struggled and fired a shot at the boat, wounding one of the boatmen; the other was swept away by the waves and disappeared without a trace.

The heroic transport boat docked at Meihua Town, Changle, and was greeted by the local people. The injured boatman was also sent to the hospital for treatment by the local government.

    两名蒋军拦劫未逞
    被我船工智抛大海
    新华社福建前线4日电　迟到消息：福建省福清县的四名船工，赤手空拳歼灭了两名前来拦劫的蒋军。
    这件事发生在3月18日清晨。当时福清县吉兆村林道庆运输船，在大雾中向福州进发。船只航经长乐漳港附近海面的时候，东边海上突然传来了马达声，随后便在浓雾中窜出一艘来路不明的机器船，直向运输船冲来。运输船转帆调方向已经来不及了。两船相靠以后，立刻有两个身穿便衣的人跳上运输船来。他们举着手枪喝问船工：“到哪里去？载什么东西？”那只机器船跟在运输船后面，还在船头上架起了机枪。船工们立刻明白了：这是蒋军拦路抢劫。
    那时刚好是东南风，运输船鼓帆朝闽江口飞快前进。在浓雾中，蒋军机器船跟了一段路，便迷失在雾海里。那两个在运输船上的蒋军转回头看不到自己的船，登时慌张起来，举着手枪命令掌舵的船工把船开去白犬岛。那个船工没理他，船头仍朝着大陆。这时蒋军气急了，悄悄商量要杀害两个船工，然后再迫使另外两个把船向白犬岛开去。可是，蒋军的话被掌舵的船工听到了，他机智地向另外三个船工使了一个眼色，他们立刻一跃而上，把这两名蒋军拦腰抱住。蒋军不及开枪，就被抛进大海里去了。其中一个挣扎着朝船上打了一枪，打伤了一个船工；另一个被大浪卷得无影无踪。
    英勇的运输船在长乐梅花镇靠岸后，受到了当地人民的慰问。受伤的船工也由当地政府送到医院治疗。
