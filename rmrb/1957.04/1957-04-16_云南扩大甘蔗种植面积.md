Xinhua News Agency, Kunming. Sugarcane has been widely planted in the southern subtropical regions of Yunnan Province. After several years of trial planting in the Yuanjiang, Nujiang, Lancangjiang River basins, and the Jinshajiang River coastal areas, which have warm climates and abundant water resources, the sugarcane area has been greatly expanded this year. The sugarcane planting area in the province can reach 400,000 mu this year, which is about double that of last year.

In order to strive to make Yunnan Province one of the major sugarcane producing areas in the country within twelve years, the relevant leading departments have successively built local state-owned mechanical sugar factories and established sugarcane plantations for cultivating improved varieties in the sugarcane producing areas.

    云南扩大甘蔗种植面积
    据新华社昆明讯　云南省南部亚热带地区已经普遍地栽种甘蔗。气候温暖、水源充沛的元江、怒江、澜沧江流域和金沙江沿岸的广大少数民族地区，经过几年来的试种，今年甘蔗面积大大扩大。全省甘蔗种植面积今年可以达到四十万亩，将比去年增加一倍左右。
    为了争取在十二年内使云南省成为全国甘蔗主要产区之一，有关领导部门已经陆续在甘蔗产区兴建地方国营机械制糖厂和设立培育良种的甘蔗种植园。
