Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, April 9th: The steel girders of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge are being assembled on the last span. It is expected that the bridge's steel girders will be joined together ahead of schedule on the No. 6 pier in the river's center in the first half of May.

The steel girders of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge consist of three sections with nine spans, totaling 1,140 meters in length. It is being erected using a new method called the "cantilever erection method," which involves assembling and riveting section by section from one end to the other. So far, the first and third sections, which were started from the Hanyang and Wuchang sides respectively towards the opposite bank, have been completely assembled. The second section, from the No. 3 pier to the No. 6 pier in the river's center, has already had two spans assembled and is advancing from the No. 5 pier towards the No. 6 pier. The riveting work of the steel girders is also being accelerated in line with the progress of the assembly.

According to the annual plan of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau for this year, the steel girders were scheduled to be joined together in July. However, due to the rapid progress of the girder erection project in the first quarter, it is expected that the steel girders can be joined together ahead of schedule in the first half of May. The completion time of the entire bridge will also be advanced accordingly.

### 长江大桥钢梁快架好了

    长江大桥钢梁快架好了
    新华社武汉9日电　武汉长江大桥的钢梁已经拼装到最后一孔。预计在5月上半月内，大桥的钢梁就可以提前在江心六号桥墩合拢。
    武汉长江大桥的钢梁共三联九孔，全长一千一百四十公尺。它是用一种叫作“伸臂架梁法”的新方法，即从一端向另一端逐节拼装和铆合的方法进行架设的。到目前为止，先后开始从汉阳岸和武昌岸向对岸方向架设的第一和第三联已经全部拼装完毕：从江心三号桥墩到六号桥墩的第二联，现在已经拼装好两孔，正从五号桥墩向六号桥墩挺进。钢梁的铆合工作也正和拼装进度相适应地在加速进行中。
    按照武汉长江大桥工程局今年的年度计划，钢梁的合拢时间应在7月份。但由于第一季度架梁工程进行得较快，预计到5月上半月内钢梁就可以提前合拢。全桥建成的时间也将因此提前。
