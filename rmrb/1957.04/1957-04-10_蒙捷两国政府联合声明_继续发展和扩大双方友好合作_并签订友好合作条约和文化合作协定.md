Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator, April 9th: A joint statement was signed on April 8th by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Mongolian People's Republic, Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal, and the Prime Minister of the Czechoslovak Republic, Viliam Široký.

The statement said that the friendly and cooperative relations between the Mongolian People's Republic and the Czechoslovak Republic have developed significantly, especially in the last two years, and will continue to develop and expand in the future. The Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation signed by the two governments will be a solid foundation for continuing to develop friendly relations and close cooperation between the two countries.

The statement said that the leaders of the two governments have completely identical views on current international issues. The two governments advocate peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems.

The two governments also noted with satisfaction that the solidarity and fraternal cooperation of the countries of the socialist camp, the reliable guarantee of world peace, is being consolidated day by day. Friendly visits and talks between national leaders and fraternal parties demonstrate the ideological unity of socialist countries and their further solidarity around the Soviet Union and China. The two governments declared that they will continue to adhere to the principles of proletarian internationalism and fight against all phenomena that distort Marxism-Leninism.

The statement pointed out that the powerful force of the world peace and democracy camp can shatter the war conspiracies of imperialism and ease the international situation.

The statement also condemned the aggressive attempts of imperialism. The statement said that the two governments believe that the recent Bermuda talks between the United States and Britain show that they are continuing to create international tension and interfere in the internal affairs of countries in the Middle East and Near East.

The two governments believe that in the current international situation, the Warsaw Treaty has the role of opposing imperialist conspiracies and protecting the security of European countries. The Mongolian government fully supports the purpose of this organization and the measures it has taken.

In the statement, the two governments reiterated their firm support for the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government. The statement said that the two governments' views on the Hungarian events are fully consistent with the conclusions drawn by the Soviet-Hungarian declaration on these events in March of this year.

The two governments expressed their full support for the efforts of the German Democratic Republic to unify Germany on a peaceful and democratic basis.

The statement said that the United Nations cannot successfully fulfill its obligations until the People's Republic of China, as one of the great powers, has obtained its legitimate seat in the United Nations. Without China's participation, no international peace and security issues can be resolved. The Czechoslovak government believes that the peace-loving and independent Mongolian People's Republic will be able to join the United Nations.

The statement finally announced that Prime Minister Široký, on behalf of the Czechoslovak government, invited Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Mongolia, and other Mongolian leaders to visit Czechoslovakia, and Chairman Tsedenbal has accepted the invitation.

Xinhua News Agency, Ulan Bator, April 9th: Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Mongolian People's Republic, and Viliam Široký, Prime Minister of the Czechoslovak Republic, signed a Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between the two countries in Ulan Bator on the afternoon of April 8th.

The treaty said that based on the desire to continue developing the friendly relations and fraternal cooperation between Mongolia and Czechoslovakia, expanding and deepening economic cooperation between the two countries, and maintaining world peace and security, the two countries decided to conclude a Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation.

The treaty said that both sides will cooperate in international affairs on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty and independence, non-interference in internal affairs, and equality and mutual benefit, and consolidate world peace and security in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter.

Both sides will provide each other with economic cooperation and assistance in the cause of peaceful construction, and mutually undertake economic cooperation obligations that are beneficial to both sides.

Both sides recognize the significance of cultural cooperation and will use all conditions to develop cooperation in science, education, and culture in the future.

The treaty is valid for twenty years, and unless one party declares its termination in writing twelve months before its expiration, the treaty will continue to be valid for ten years.
