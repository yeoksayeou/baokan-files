    Small Change Put to Good Use, Mutual Assistance
    Wuhan Residents Establish Economic Mutual Aid Groups

    (Our newspaper reports) Wuhan residents helping each other economically has become a trend.

    There are currently more than 3,300 residents' economic mutual aid groups in the city. With an average of 30 households per group, at least 99,000 households in the city participate in this type of organization. Over the past year, residents' economic mutual aid groups have played a significant role in resolving residents' temporary financial difficulties and cultivating residents' habit of thrift.

    Six residents' committees in Qiaokou’s Liji Road have established 26 residents' economic mutual aid groups since January of last year, solving temporary financial difficulties such as funerals, weddings, and illnesses for many people. The Second and Third Family Dormitories of the Shenxin Textile Factory established an economic mutual aid group in June last year, with all 450 households participating. Members paid mutual aid funds ranging from a few cents to more than one yuan per month. By the end of last year, the stored amount of more than a dozen economic mutual aid groups had reached 1,500 yuan. Within six months, the economic mutual aid group provided loans to 90 households.

    Residents' economic mutual aid groups deposit the mutual aid funds received each month into the bank, and the principal and interest are distributed to the members at the end of the year. Many members purchase clothing and holiday food after receiving the mutual aid funds at the end of the year, and everyone is very happy. (Dong Er)

    零钱整用　互相帮助
    武汉市居民成立经济互助组
    本报讯　武汉市居民在经济上互相帮助，已经成了一种风气。
    全市现有三千三百多个居民经济互助组，每组平均以三十户计算，全市至少有九万九千户参加了这种组织。一年来，居民经济互助组在解决居民临时经济困难和培养居民节约习惯上起了不小的作用。
    礄口利济路六个居民委员会，从去年1月起，陆续成立了二十六个居民经济互助组，给许多人解决了丧葬、结婚、疾病等临时性的经济困难。申新纱厂第二、第三家属宿舍，去年6月成立了经济互助组，四百五十户家属全部参加。组员每月交纳互助金少的几角，多的一元以上，到去年年底，十多个经济互助组储存金额已达一千五百元。半年内经济互助组给九十户居民贷了款。
    居民经济互助组每月将收到的互助金存入银行，年终连本带息一起发给组员。许多组员在年终领到互助金以后，购置衣物和过节的食品，大家都很高兴。　（东耳）
