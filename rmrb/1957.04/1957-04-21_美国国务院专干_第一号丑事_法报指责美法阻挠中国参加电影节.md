Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 20th:

“L'Humanité,” in its coverage of the Cannes International Film Festival in France, believes that the invitation of the Chiang Kai-shek gang from Taiwan by the French government to participate in the film festival, thereby obstructing the participation of the delegation from the People's Republic of China, is the "top scandal" of the film festival.

The newspaper said: "This top scandal greatly diminishes the world's largest international film competition, and the Americans are responsible for this scandal." The newspaper accused the French government of also being complicit.

Paris's "Libération," in commenting on this event, raised the question, "If the competition of artistic expression of all film-producing countries is restricted by the U.S. State Department, how can the development of film art be promoted?" The newspaper pointed out that socialist countries produce about three hundred films each year, which is equal to the total film production of France, Italy, and the United Kingdom.

"Le Monde," in reporting this news, expressed surprise at the obstruction of the participation of the delegation from the People's Republic of China. It pointed out that the government authorities' approach is contrary to the film festival's charter.

    美国国务院专干“第一号丑事”
    法报指责美法阻挠中国参加电影节
    据新华社20日讯　巴黎消息：
  “人道报”在报道法国戛纳国际电影节时认为：台湾蒋帮被法国政府邀约参加电影节从而阻碍中华人民共和国代表团的参加是电影节的“第一号丑事”。
    这家报纸说：“这第一号丑事使得世界上最大的国际电影竞赛大为减色，美国人是这件丑事的负责人”。报纸指责法国政府也参与了同谋。
    巴黎“解放报”在评论这个事件的时候提出质问，“如果所有制片国家艺术表现的竞赛由美国国务院来加以限制的话，怎么能促进电影艺术的发展呢？”报纸指出：社会主义国家每年出产约三百部影片，即等于法国、意大利、英国的电影生产的总和。
    “世界报”在报道这个消息时对于中华人民共和国代表团的参加受到阻挠表示惊异。它指出政府当局的做法是违背电影节章程的。
