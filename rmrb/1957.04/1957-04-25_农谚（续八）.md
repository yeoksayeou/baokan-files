　　Collected by Su Keqin

　　V. About Harvesting

　　The rules of crop growth and the time of harvest: "One foot of ears, three feet high" (referring to wheat ears being one foot high when budding, and growing to three feet high when mature). "Grain Rain, wheat conceives; Start of Summer, wheat shows awns." "Wheat harvest in a morning, silkworms mature in an instant." "Grain in Ear sees wheat stubble." "When blue swallows show their heads (referring to when blue swallow chicks hatch), cotton blossoms." "Eighteen days after the Start of Autumn, every blade of grass bears seeds." "The Limit of Heat determines the harvest." "If heads don't show at the Limit of Heat, cut it to feed the old cow." "Whether to harvest or not, look at the 20th of the sixth month; whether to flood or not, look at the 20th of the seventh month." "The 15th of the seventh month determines drought and flood, the 15th of the eighth month determines the harvest." "Flower sees flower, forty-eight" (referring to the time it takes for cotton from flowering to boll opening). "Flowers bloom on the 15th of the seventh month, pick flowers on the 15th of the eighth month." "Flowers blooming at the Limit of Heat cannot be seen (referring to cotton only flowering at the Limit of Heat and not being able to open bolls before harvest)." "If flowers don't bloom at the Limit of Heat, you definitely won't pick white cotton." "One ear and a half, in your mouth in a month" (referring to the period from millet heading to maturity). "On the sixth day of the sixth month, look at the millet ears; on the seventh day of the seventh month, eat new rice." "On the eighth day of the eighth month, pinch the millet" (referring to the time of harvesting millet, pinching the millet refers to pinching the millet ears).
