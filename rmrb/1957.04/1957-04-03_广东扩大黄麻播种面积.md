Guangdong Expands Jute Planting Area

(Our report) The sowing of over 400,000 mu of jute in Guangdong is fully underway. In the famous high-yield jute areas of Dongguan and Wuchuan counties, 80% of the jute fields have already been sown with seeds. The jute seedlings that were planted earlier and have already emerged from the soil are growing well, thanks to the various measures taken by farmers to resist the continuous spring rains and their careful cultivation.

This year, Guangdong Province's jute production scale is larger than ever before. According to the provincial agricultural department's plan, this year's jute area will be expanded by more than 120,000 mu compared to last year, with Dongguan, Xinhui, Panyu, Wuchuan, Chao'an, and other thirteen counties as the key development areas. The total output is required to reach 1.35 million dan, an increase of 37% compared to last year and more than nine times the highest pre-war annual output. After the realization of this plan, it will not only be able to meet the industrial jute needs of various jute textile factories in the province, but also have surplus jute to support other areas.

    广东扩大黄麻播种面积
    本报讯　广东四十多万亩黄麻的播种工作全面展开。著名的黄麻高产地区——东莞、吴川等县，已经有80％的麻田播下了种籽。播种较早而已出土的麻苗，经过农民采取多种办法抗御连绵的春雨和细心地加以培育后，大多数生长良好。
    今年，广东省的黄麻生产规模，比历年宏大。据省农业部门的计划，今年黄麻面积要比去年扩大十二万多亩，并以东莞、新会、番禺、吴川、潮安等十三个县为发展的重点，总产量要求达到一百三十五万担，比去年增产37％，超过战前最高年产量的九倍。这个计划实现后，不仅可以满足省内各个麻织厂的工业用麻需要，还将有多余的黄麻支援外地。　　（李少球）
