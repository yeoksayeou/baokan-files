Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 1st: Vienna dispatch: The Seventeenth Congress of the Austrian Communist Party concluded on March 31st after electing a new Central Committee. The new Central Committee consists of sixty-nine members and twenty-eight alternate members.

The congress unanimously passed a resolution on the war crisis and neutralization, a resolution on mutual relations with communist parties of various countries, a resolution on Austria's economic struggle, a resolution on youth work, and a resolution on proposing amendments to the Party Constitution.

The resolution on the war crisis and neutralization pointed out that the Austrian government has taken a series of actions that violate neutrality, such as prohibiting the Secretariat of the World Peace Council from operating in Austria. The resolution requires the Austrian government to fulfill complete, strict, and unquestionable neutrality.

The resolution on mutual relations with communist parties of various countries stated that the experience of the first socialist country is of great significance for socialist construction in various countries. Socialist construction should conform to specific conditions, prerequisites, and national characteristics. However, it is very dangerous to deny the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism and underestimate the class struggle in the name of national characteristics. Communist parties must fight against this dangerous tendency. The basic principles and basic forms of socialist construction are the same in any country.

Central Political Bureau member Hönisch emphasized in his closing speech: "Our party has not weakened but strengthened since the Sixteenth Congress. It has eliminated bad elements and vacillating elements. The party's ideology and line have also become clearer. Although the Austrian Communist Party has encountered some difficulties recently, its confidence in the cause of the working class is unwavering."

According to the report of the Credentials Committee of the Congress, a total of 389 delegates with voting rights participated in the Congress.

Xinhua News Agency, March 31st dispatch: TASS Vienna dispatch: The Seventeenth Congress of the Austrian Communist Party concluded the discussion of the reports by Austrian Communist Party Chairman Koplenig and Austrian Communist Party Central Secretary Fürnberg on the evening of the 30th, after which Koplenig delivered a concluding speech.

Koplenig pointed out the great significance of the Seventeenth Congress of the Austrian Communist Party for the Party's future work. He emphasized that all speeches at the meeting convincingly demonstrated that the Austrian Communist Party stands on the position of Marxism-Leninism and on the position of socialism.

A large part of Koplenig's speech discussed the dangers of revisionism and liquidationism tendencies to the Party, and the dangers of attempts to isolate the Austrian Communist Party from other fraternal parties, from the Soviet Union, and from the people's democratic countries.

Koplenig pointed out that in order for the Party to win its struggle, two basic conditions must be met in the future: first, to improve and strengthen ties with fraternal parties, especially with the parties of socialist countries; second, to strengthen the Party's ranks.

The meeting finally unanimously adopted a resolution on Koplenig's report, expressing its approval of the Austrian Communist Party Central Committee's policies. The meeting also passed a resolution on Fürnberg's report, which approved the "Basic Arguments of Austria's Path to Socialism" and used these arguments as the basis for formulating programmatic documents on this issue.

    奥共第十七次代表大会闭幕
    选出新的中央委员会并通过五项决议
    新华社柏林1日电　维也纳消息：奥地利共产党第十七次代表大会3月31日在选举了新的中央委员会以后闭幕。新的中央委员会共有委员六十九人，候补委员二十八人。
    大会一致通过了关于战争危机和中立化的决议、关于同各国共产党的相互关系的决议、关于奥地利的经济斗争的决议、关于青年工作的决议和关于建议修改党章的决议。
    关于战争危机和中立化的决议指出：奥地利政府曾经采取一连串违反中立的行动，譬如禁止世界和平理事会书记处在奥地利境内活动等。决议要求奥地利政府履行完全的、严格的、不令人怀疑的中立。
    关于同各国共产党的相互关系的决议说：第一个社会主义国家的经验，对于各国的社会主义建设都有巨大的意义。社会主义建设应该符合具体的条件、前提和民族特点。但是，如果借口民族特点来否定马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，并且对阶级斗争估计不足，那是十分危险的。共产党必须对这种危险倾向进行斗争。社会主义建设的基本原则和基本形式在任何国家都是一样的。
    中央政治局委员贺纳在闭幕词中强调指出：“我们的党自从第十六次代表大会以来不是削弱而是加强了。它消除了坏分子和动摇分子。党的思想和路线也更加明确了。奥地利共产党尽管在最近期间遇到了一些困难，但是它对于工人阶级事业的信心是坚定不移的。”
    据大会资格审查委员会报告，参加这次代表大会的共有三百八十九个有选举权的代表。
    据新华社31日讯　据塔斯社维也纳讯：奥地利共产党第十七次代表大会30日晚间在结束了对奥共主席柯普勒尼希和奥共中央书记费恩柏两人的报告的讨论以后，由柯普勒尼希作总结发言。
    柯普勒尼希指出了奥共第十七次代表大会对党今后的工作的巨大意义。他强调指出，会上的所有发言都令人信服地说明，奥地利共产党是站在马克思列宁主义立场上的，是站在社会主义立场上的。
    柯普勒尼希的讲话有很大一部分是谈修正主义和取消主义倾向对党的危险性，以及使奥共同其他国家兄弟党、同苏联和人民民主国家隔离的企图对党的危险性。
    柯普勒尼希指出，为了党的胜利斗争，今后必须实现两个基本条件：第一，改进和加强同兄弟党的联系，特别是同社会主义国家的党的联系；第二，加强党的队伍。
    会议最后一致通过了关于柯普勒尼希的报告的决议，表示赞同奥共中央的政策。会议还通过了关于费恩柏的报告的决议，其中批准了
  “奥地利走向社会主义的道路的基本论点”，并且把这些论点作为就这一问题制定纲领性文件的基础。
