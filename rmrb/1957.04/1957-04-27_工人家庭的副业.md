    Sideline Occupations of Worker Families
    Ge Chun
    Since 1954, the Xiangchang Lumber Processing Factory in Harbin has organized its employees' families to engage in sideline production such as gardening, raising livestock, sewing, dismantling and washing clothes, and participating in auxiliary factory work, which has greatly improved the lives of the employees' families. The employees and their families are very satisfied.
    The Xiangchang Lumber Processing Factory is located in the suburbs of Harbin, in a remote area. There is only one cooperative, and the supply of vegetables is not timely, and the variety is not complete. To eat fresh vegetables, sometimes you have to walk more than six miles to the city to buy them, and the family members feel that eating vegetables is a difficult problem. According to some people's suggestions, the factory's family committee decided to mobilize the employees' families to use the open space in front of and behind their houses to engage in gardening and grow their own vegetables. The family committee was responsible for dividing the land equally. Most families can grow three crops of vegetables every year, and some grow four crops a year. From April to September, most of the employees' families eat spinach, cabbage, etc., without having to buy them. Each household can save 30 cents on vegetable costs per day, saving 54 yuan in half a year. A few families can also store vegetables for autumn and winter consumption. Individual households can sell a portion of their vegetables in addition to their own consumption.
    Some employees' families raise pigs themselves to improve their lives. After the family committee publicized and mobilized them, many families became interested in raising pigs. By 1956, 270 households were raising pigs, with a maximum of 628 pigs. In order to lead this sideline production well, a pig-raising management committee was established under the leadership of the family committee, and some necessary systems were established. The trade union also provided some loans to households with financial difficulties who were unable to engage in sideline occupations. The employees' families raising pigs has played a certain role in alleviating the tight supply of meat on the market and improving the lives of the employees. Originally, eight employees' households needed regular relief, but after engaging in sideline production, they no longer needed relief. Liu Xinghan's family of six, whose family members were also sick, had a monthly salary of 50 yuan, and their life was quite difficult. Since the trade union provided a loan to raise pigs, in less than half a year, they no longer needed trade union subsidies and purchased clothing, quilts, and other supplies. Liu Xinghan also worked harder than before.
    In such a remote place, it is difficult to find a laundry to wash clothes. There are also many single employees in this factory. If they take their dirty clothes to the city to wash, it takes a long time and costs a lot of money. It is especially difficult to dismantle and wash cotton quilts and clothes and mend socks. In view of this situation, the family committee organized ten households with relatively difficult lives to form a laundry group. The laundry group dismantles and washes clothes and bedding quickly and cheaply, and is warmly welcomed by single employees. Family members participating in the laundry group can generally increase their income by 15 yuan per month. The hygiene of the factory's single employee dormitories has also improved compared to the past.
    The factory's family committee also established four sewing groups according to the distribution of residences, according to the requirements of some employees' families. The sewing groups mainly process work clothes for factory employees and help families with some needlework. People participating in the sewing group can earn 30 to 50 yuan per month when there is work. In 1956, the sewing group processed a total of 308 sets of work clothes, 475 pairs of pants, and 1,002 sets of sleeves for the factory. Each set of work clothes was 2 yuan cheaper than making them in the city, each pair of pants was 1 yuan cheaper, and each set of sleeves was 10 cents cheaper, saving the state more than 1,190 yuan in total. The employees also have good comments on the sewing group. Some people said: "In the past, the work clothes made by the cooperative were all one size and did not fit properly. Now, the sewing group makes them themselves, and they can make them whatever size you want."
    In addition, the factory's family committee also organized some family members to participate in auxiliary labor in the factory, such as gluing plywood and bundling plywood edges, with an average daily income of one to two yuan. This has also played a role in solving the living difficulties of employees and helping the factory to better complete its production tasks.

    工人家庭的副业
    葛春
    哈尔滨市香场木材加工厂从1954年起，先后组织职工家属从事园艺、饲养家畜、缝纫、拆洗、参加工厂辅助劳动等副业生产，对改善职工家庭的生活起了很好的作用。职工和职工家属们都很满意。　　香场木材加工厂在哈尔滨郊区，地方很偏僻，只有一个合作社，蔬菜供应得不及时，品种也不全。要吃新鲜蔬菜，有时要走六里多路到市里去买，家属们都感到吃菜是个困难问题。工厂的家属委员会根据有些人的提议，决定发动职工家属利用房前房后空地搞园艺，自己种菜。家属委员会负责把地进行了平均分配。大部分家属每年都能种三茬菜，有的一年种四茬。4月到9月，大部分职工家庭吃菠菜、白菜等，都不用去买。每户一天能节省三角菜金，半年节省五十四元。少数家庭还可以储藏下秋季和冬季食用的蔬菜。个别户除自己食用外还可以卖一部分菜。
    有的职工家属为了改善生活，自己喂养生猪，经过家属委员会进行宣传动员，许多家属都对饲养生猪发生了兴趣。到1956年就有二百七十户养了猪，最多的时候养了六百二十八口。为了领导好这项副业生产，在家属委员会领导下，成立了养猪管理委员会，并且建立了一些必要的制度。工会对生活困难无力搞副业的户还发放给一些贷款。职工家属们饲养生猪，对于缓和市场上肉类供应紧张情况和改善职工生活起了一定的作用。原来有八户职工需要经常救济，搞起副业生产以后，他们就不需要救济了。工人刘兴汗一家六口人，家属还有病，每月工资五十元，生活相当困难；自从工会贷款养猪，不到半年，他们就不再需要工会补助，并且添置了棉衣、被子等用品。刘兴汗工作起来也比过去更起劲了。
    在这样一个偏僻的地方，要想找个洗衣房洗洗衣服是很困难的。这个厂独身职工又很多，他们穿脏的衣服，如果拿到市里去洗，时间长，花钱多。特别是要拆洗棉被、棉衣，补袜子，就更困难。根据这种情况，家属委员会组织生活比较困难的十户家属成立了洗衣组。洗衣组拆洗衣服被褥，又快又便宜，受到单身职工热烈欢迎。参加洗衣组的家属每月一般都能增加十五元的收入。厂里独身职工宿舍的卫生情况也比过去改善了。
    这个厂的家属委员会还根据部分职工家属的要求，按住宅分布成立了四个缝纫组。缝纫组主要是给工厂职工加工作业服，帮家属们做一些针线活。参加缝纫组的人，在有活时每月每人能收入三十到五十元。1956年，缝纫组共给工厂加工作业服三百零八套，裤子四百七十五条，套袖一千零二个。每套工作服比在市里做便宜两元，裤子每条便宜一元，套袖每个便宜一角，共为国家节省一千一百九十多元。职工们对缝纫组也有好评。有的人说：“过去合作社做的作业服都是一个号，穿着不合适；现在缝纫组自己作，要多大号就给做多大号的了。”
    另外，这个厂的家属委员会还组织一些家属参加了工厂中并胶合板、捆胶板边子等辅助劳动，平均每天收入一元至二元。这对解决职工生活困难和帮助工厂更好地完成生产任务也起了一些作用。
