    At a Tea Farmer's Home
    Yan Chen
  A layer of white snow covers the tea trees on the mountains,
  The green tea trees are about to sprout again.
  Walking through the small path in the middle of the tea forest,
  We arrived at a farmer's home in the village of Batumi.
  The large wooden house is built on top of stone pillars,
  Several lemon trees are surrounded by a low fence.
  The host brings fresh honey,
  And brews a cup of red tea grown by their own family.
  The rich tea contains rich friendship,
  A cup of tea replaces thousands of heartfelt words.
  Kind memories float into my mind,
  This is not a foreign country, it's more like being at the foot of Mount Wuyi!

    在茶农家
    严辰
  满山的茶树上盖一层白雪，
  碧绿的茶树又快要发芽。
  穿过茶林中间的小径，
  我们来到巴统山村的农家。
  宽大的木屋搭在石柱上面，
  几株柠檬树围一圈矮篱笆。
  主人端来新鲜的蜂蜜，
  泡一杯自家栽种的红茶。
  浓浓的茶里有浓浓的友谊，
  一杯茶代替了千万句知心话。
  亲切的回忆浮上我心头，
  这哪里是异国，更像是在武夷山下！
