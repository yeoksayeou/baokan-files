    New Atmosphere and New Efforts
    Feng Youlan
    Many people are showing unprecedented enthusiasm for the study of the history of philosophy. The philosophical community does not yet have "a hundred schools," but it has already begun to "contend." All misgivings should be dispelled.
    In recent meetings and contacts with various parties, I have felt that Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee are using the power of "turning the universe upside down" to correct the dogmatic atmosphere in academic and artistic circles. Who says the Party cannot lead scientific research and artistic creation? This is the greatest and most correct leadership. Of course, to say that the Party can lead scientific research and artistic creation does not mean that the Party can guide how a certain experiment should be conducted in science, or how a certain work should be written; to say that the Party leads only means that the Party points out a correct direction and path for us. "Let a hundred schools of thought contend" and "Let a hundred flowers bloom" are precisely the correct direction and the correct path pointed out to us by the Party.
    Last month, in my speech at the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, I said: Since the principle of "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" was put forward, because the time has been very short, no special achievements have been shown. This does not mean that since this principle was put forward, the atmosphere in academic circles has not changed. As far as I am familiar with the situation in the philosophical community, since the principle of "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" was put forward, the atmosphere of research and study has changed significantly.
    Engels said: "Theoretical thinking is merely an innate ability. This ability must be developed and exercised, and for this exercise, there is no other means than studying previous philosophy until now." (Dialectics of Nature, page 23, People's Publishing House edition) This famous saying has been forgotten for a long time. In recent years, the study of philosophy has often been limited to studying textbooks of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, and the classic works of Marxism. This is necessary, but it is not enough. Since the principle of "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" was put forward, an unprecedented enthusiasm has been shown for the study of the history of philosophy. I gave lectures on the history of Chinese philosophy in Baoding and Tianjin, and the audience reached more than a thousand people. This is a new phenomenon.
    There is also a new atmosphere in the research of the history of philosophy. In January, the Department of Philosophy of Peking University held a symposium on the methodology of the history of philosophy. In the symposium, everyone debated many issues fiercely; however, as far as I personally felt, there was not much disagreement on several points. The first point: in the history of philosophy, there is a struggle between materialism and idealism, and there is also a unity. There is much debate about how to unite, but everyone agrees that there is indeed a unity. Overemphasizing this unity is wrong, and not acknowledging it is also wrong. The second point: regarding the issue of philosophical inheritance, everyone debated even more fiercely; but everyone agrees that there are many things in the philosophical heritage of the past that can be inherited. This inheritance is also a very complex matter, and it is not as everyone has thought in the past few years, that materialism only inherits the tradition of materialism, and idealism only inherits the tradition of idealism. There are many intricate relationships between materialism and idealism. The third point: Therefore, everyone believes that the materialism in the history of philosophy should be carefully studied and promoted, and the idealism in the history of philosophy should also be carefully analyzed and criticized, and the method of "killing it with one word" should not be adopted. Some systems in the history of philosophy should not be ignored simply by labeling them with the hat of idealism. These are all corrections to the deviations of the past few years.
    Everyone also realizes that in order to study the history of philosophy, we must first master several guiding principles of Marxism. However, the specific content of history is much richer than principles, and the study of the history of philosophy must also proceed from reality, that is, it must start from the original materials. Studying the history of philosophy is just like studying other things: "There is no right to speak without investigation and research." This requires learning to read ancient texts and books. For ancient philosophers, we must first understand what they are saying before we can analyze and evaluate their thoughts.
    This is all a new atmosphere, and this atmosphere is healthy.
    We can say that although there are not yet "a hundred schools" in the philosophical community, "contention" has already begun. However, it seems that intellectuals still have some misgivings, and I think these misgivings are unnecessary.
    The first misgiving is that they are still a little afraid of being labeled. Indeed, in the past few years, labels have been a little scary. I heard that in a university in another province, a professor was labeled with the hat of having feudal ideological remnants for buying a few Buddhist scriptures from a pile of waste paper on the street, and everyone criticized him, and his salary was reduced by one grade during the salary evaluation. I think this atmosphere of labeling will be eliminated in the future. Even if there are still such individual phenomena, I don't think it matters much. Suppose I express an opinion, and someone puts a hat on me, I should check my own thoughts again, in the old words, that is, "introspect myself" or "reflect on myself." If this hat is indeed suitable for me or partially suitable, then I should correct my wrong thoughts; if it is not suitable, I can throw the hat back. Therefore, in the atmosphere of free research and free discussion, even if someone puts a hat on, there is nothing to be afraid of.
    There are also some people who have this concern: they believe that after an idea is put forward, they must have the power to win, and if they are refuted, they are afraid of losing face. This concern is also unnecessary. "Let a hundred schools of thought contend" is not the peaceful coexistence of a hundred schools. There has never been a situation of peaceful coexistence of a hundred schools in history. For example, in the era of the Warring States Period when a hundred schools of thought contended, Mencius criticized Yang Zhu and Mo Di, saying that they were "beasts without fathers or rulers." This criticism cannot be said to be not sharp. The situation of struggle among various schools in the history of philosophy has always been like this. This is a law of ideological development. If an idea does not arouse debate, it is probably an extremely ordinary idea. That kind of idea can actually be raised or not raised. Ideas that can arouse debate will inevitably have victories and defeats in the process of debate. The victors are of course victorious, but the losers are actually also victorious, because they can know their own mistakes, and knowing their own mistakes means that their thinking has improved. Someone used to say about playing chess: "Winning is of course happy, but losing is also joyful." This is a "cynical" statement. In academic debates, if we aim at seeking the truth, these two sentences can be quoted.
    We academic workers should dispel all misgivings and march towards science under the correct principle of "letting a hundred schools of thought contend." Under the guidance of this correct principle, the academic future of the motherland is infinitely bright, and our future is also infinitely bright.

    新风气和新努力
    冯友兰
    许多人对哲学史的学习显出了空前的热情。哲学界还没有“百家”，但已开始“争鸣”了。应该破除一切顾虑。
    在近来几次会议与各方面的接触中，我感觉到毛主席和党中央正在以“旋乾转坤”的力量纠正学术界和艺术界中教条主义的风气。谁说党不能领导科学研究和艺术创作呢？这就是最伟大最正确的领导。当然，说党能领导科学研究和艺术创作，并不是说党能指导科学中某个试验应该怎样进行，或者某个作品应该怎样下笔；说党领导只是说党给我们指出一个正确的方向和道路。“百家争鸣”、“百花齐放”正是党指给我们的一个正确方向和正确道路。
    上月我在政治协商会议全国委员会大会发言中说：自从“百家争鸣”的方针提出后，因时间很短，还没有特殊的成绩表现出来。这并不等于说自从这个方针提出后，学术界的空气还没有什么改变。就我所比较熟悉的哲学界的情况来说，自从“百家争鸣”的方针提出后，研究和学习的风气已经有很显著的改变。
    恩格斯说过：“理论的思维仅仅是一种天赋的能力。这种能力必须加以发展和锻炼，而为了这种锻炼，除了学习以往的哲学，直到现在还没有别的手段。”（自然辩证法二十三页，人民出版社版）这句名言好久仿佛是被忘记了。几年以来，对于哲学的学习，往往仅是限于学习辩证唯物主义、历史唯物主义教科书和马克思主义经典著作。这是必要的，但是是不够的。自从“百家争鸣”的方针提出后，对于哲学史的学习，显出了空前的热情。我在保定和天津作关于中国哲学史的报告，听众都达到一千多人。这是一种新现象。
    在哲学史的研究方面，也有一种新的风气。在1月间，北京大学哲学系召开了一个关于哲学史方法论的座谈会。在座谈会中对于许多问题大家争论得很热烈；但是，就我个人所感觉到的，在有几点上，大家的意见是没有很大分歧的。第一点：在哲学史中，唯物主义与唯心主义有斗争的一面，也有统一的一面。对于怎样统一是很有争论的，但是大家都认为确实有统一的一面。过于强调这个统一面是不对的，不承认有这一面也是不对的。第二点：关于哲学继承性的问题，大家的争论更为热烈；但是大家都认为在过去的哲学遗产中是有很多东西可以继承的。这种继承也是一件很复杂的事情，并不是像过去几年大家所想的，唯物主义仅只继承唯物主义的传统，唯心主义仅只继承唯心主义的传统。唯物主义与唯心主义中间是有很多交叉错综的关系。第三点：因此，大家都认为，对于哲学史中的唯物主义，应该仔细研究和发扬，对于哲学史中的唯心主义也应该加以仔细地分析和批判，不能采取一言以“毙”之的办法。对于哲学史上的有些体系，不能仅只给它扣上唯心主义的帽子，就把它置之不理。这都是对于过去几年的偏差的一种纠正。
    大家也都认识到，研究哲学史，首先要掌握马克思主义的几个指导原则。但是历史的具体内容，比原则丰富得多，研究哲学史也要从实际出发，那就是必须从原始材料入手。研究哲学史也正如研究其它东西一样，“没有调查研究，就没有发言权”。这就要学习看古文，念古书。对于古代的哲学家，首先要搞清楚他们说的什么，然后才能对他们的思想进行分析和估价。
    这都是一种新的风气，这种风气是健康的。
    我们可以说在哲学界中虽然还没有“百家”，但是已经开始“争鸣”了。不过在知识分子中似乎还有些顾虑，这些顾虑我认为都是不必要的。
    第一种顾虑是还有点怕扣帽子。的确，在过去几年中，帽子是有点可怕。听说在外省有一个高等学校里，有一位教授在街上破纸堆中买回来几部佛经就被人家扣上一顶有封建思想残余的帽子，大家群起而攻之，并且在评薪时降了一级。我想这种扣帽子的风气以后是会消除的。假使还有这种个别现象，我觉得也没有很大的关系。假定我发表一种见解，别人给我扣上一顶帽子，我就应该把自己的思想再检查一遍，用从前的话说，就是“反躬自省”或者叫“自反”。如果这顶帽子确实对我合适或者有一部分合适，那我就应该纠正我的错误思想；如果是不合适，我可以把帽子扔回去。所以在自由研究和自由讨论的风气中，即使有人扣帽子，那也没有什么可怕。
    还有一种人有这种顾虑：认为一个见解提出后，就要操必胜之权，如果被人驳倒，就怕有失面子。这种顾虑也是不必要的。“百家争鸣”并不是百家和平共处。历史上并没有百家和平共处的情况。例如在战国百家争鸣的时代，孟子批判杨朱和墨翟，说他们“无父无君是禽兽也。”这种批判不能说不尖锐。哲学史中各家斗争的情况向来是这样的。这是思想发展的一个规律。提出一种见解如果引不起辩论，那大概就是一种极其平凡的见解。那种见解实在是可以提也可以不提。能引起辩论的见解，在辩论的过程中，必然有胜有败。胜利的人固然胜利了，失败的人其实也是胜利，因为他可以知道自己的错误，知道了自己的错误就是他的思想有所提高。从前有人说：下棋“胜固欣然，败亦可喜”。这是一种“玩世不恭”的说法。学术辩论中，如果我们是以求真理为目的，这两句话倒是可以引用。
    我们学术工作者都应该破除一切顾虑，在“百家争鸣”的正确方针下向科学进军。在这种正确的方针指导下，祖国的学术前途是无限光明的，我们的前途也是无限光明的。
