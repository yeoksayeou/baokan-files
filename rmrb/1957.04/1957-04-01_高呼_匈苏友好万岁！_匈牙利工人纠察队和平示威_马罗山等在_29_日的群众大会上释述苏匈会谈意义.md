Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, March 31st. Following a mass meeting of over 100,000 people in Budapest to celebrate the publication of the declarations and statements of the Hungarian and Soviet governments and parties, more than 5,000 workers' militia members in Budapest held a peaceful demonstration on March 30th.

At 2:00 PM, the demonstration divided into four routes and marched through the main streets of Buda and Pest. The demonstrators were all dressed in gray work clothes, wearing dark blue "Comrade" caps, red armbands, pistols at their waists, and carrying submachine guns, marching neatly through the streets. They also sang revolutionary songs such as "Ode to Light" and shouted "Long Live the Socialist Workers' Party!" "Long Live Hungarian-Soviet Friendship!" Some of the masses along the road also shouted slogans. One route of the procession shouted "Long Live Hungarian-Chinese Friendship!" as they passed the Chinese Embassy.

It was raining in the morning, but the weather cleared up when the procession marched. The procession lasted two hours.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, March 31st. Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and government leaders Marosan, Münnich, Biszku, and Rónai spoke at mass meetings held in four districts of Budapest on the 29th. They spoke to a total of over 100,000 people about the significance of the Hungarian-Soviet talks.

Marosan said at the mass meeting in the Eighth District that Hungarian-Soviet friendship existed in the past and will continue to exist in the future. The Soviet Union has twice given the Hungarian people fraternal help. We are not isolated; standing with us are the Soviet Union, China with its 600 million people, and the entire socialist camp. He expressed satisfaction that the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the French Communist Party supported the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government and the Socialist Workers' Party in their joint statement. Marosan suggested building a monument to the martyred communists and naming streets after the heroes. He said that on November 4th, Comrade Kádár and we together made a guarantee that we will not repeat the mistakes of Rákosi, nor the mistakes of Nagy, but we must resolutely strike against the enemy. We will also never allow the negation of the revolutionary achievements of the past twelve years. He said that although we now only have 230,000 party members, our party is stronger than when we had 900,000 party members in the past.

Münnich spoke at a mass meeting held at the Vasas stadium and answered some questions raised by the masses. The atmosphere of the meeting was reminiscent of the close meetings between party leaders and the masses in the 1945-46 period.

After talking about the causes of the October events and the significance of the Soviet army liberating Hungary twice, Münnich said that this time the Moscow talks gave us tremendous assistance again. We must know that this assistance was also obtained by the Soviet people through hard work. They give us assistance because they know that the fate of our two peoples is common. We must redouble our efforts, coupled with the help of others, to achieve real success.

In his speech at the mass meeting in the Tenth District, Biszku elaborated on the counter-revolutionary nature of the October events and explained that the counter-revolutionary riots reduced national income by 12 billion forints. He said that it is ridiculous for some to attribute the current improvement in living standards to the events of October 23rd. The improvement in living standards should be attributed to the socialist countries, whose people are tightening their belts to help us overcome difficulties. But to completely overcome the difficulties, we can only rely on our own efforts. He pointed out that now the tactics of the counter-revolutionaries have changed, and they are trying to carry out sabotage in the economy, create difficulties, and prevent the unfolding of construction work. Biszku concluded by saying that we must strengthen the worker-peasant alliance with all our strength, and strengthen the leading force of this alliance - the revolutionary party of the working class.

In his speech at the mass meeting in the Twentieth District, Rónai said that young people still do not understand what the fascism and counter-revolution of the old Hungary were, and we parents have a responsibility to make up for this deficiency. We must tell our children that it is the hard work of the workers and peasants that has created the conditions for them to study. He also said that writers and artists should provide people with more good spiritual food, and teachers should educate the younger generation well.

    高呼“匈苏友好万岁！”
    匈牙利工人纠察队和平示威
    马罗山等在29日的群众大会上释述苏匈会谈意义
    新华社布达佩斯31日电　继布达佩斯为苏匈两国政府及两党宣言和声明的发表而举行了十万多人的群众大会之后，布达佩斯又有五千多名工人纠察队员在3月30日举行了和平示威游行。
    下午二时，游行队伍分四路在布达和佩斯的主要街道游行。游行者一律穿着灰色的工人服，戴着深蓝色的“同志”帽，佩着红色的臂章，腰间挂着手枪，手里端着冲锋枪，整齐地走过大街。他们还唱着“光明颂”等革命歌曲，高呼“社会主义工人党万岁！”“匈苏友好万岁！”路旁有的群众也跟着喊口号。有一路队伍在经过中国大使馆门前时高呼“匈中友好万岁！”
    上午下着雨，当队伍游行时天气转晴。游行历两小时结束。
    新华社布达佩斯31日电　匈牙利社会主义工人党和政府的领导人马罗山、明尼赫、比斯库和罗奈伊29日分别在布达佩斯四个区举行的群众大会上讲了话。他们向总共十万多群众谈到了匈苏会谈的意义。
    马罗山在第八区的群众大会上说，匈苏友谊过去存在，今后仍旧存在。苏联曾经两次给予匈牙利人民以兄弟般的帮助。我们不是孤立的，同我们站在一起的有苏联、六亿人民的中国和整个社会主义阵营。他对南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟和法国共产党在联合声明中支持匈牙利工农革命政府和社会主义工人党一点表示满意。马罗山建议为被害的共产党人修建英雄纪念碑和以烈士的名字命名街道。他说，11月4日，卡达尔同志和我们曾一起作了保证，今后不再犯拉科西的错误，也不犯纳吉的错误，但是，我们对敌人是要坚决打击的。我们也绝不容许否定过去十二年的革命成果。他说，我们现在虽然只有二十三万党员，但是我们党比过去九十万党员时还要坚强。
    在瓦兹街体育场举行的群众大会上，明尼赫讲了话，并且解答了群众提出的一些问题。大会呈现了如1945—46年时期党的领导人同群众亲密会见的气氛。
    明尼赫谈到十月事件的原因和苏军两次解放匈牙利的意义后说，这次莫斯科谈判又给了我们巨大的援助。要知道这些援助也是苏联人民用艰苦劳动所取得的。他们给予我们援助是因为他们知道我们两国人民的命运是共同的。我们要自己加倍努力，再加上人家的援助才能取得真正的成就。
    比斯库在第十区群众大会上的讲话中阐明了十月事件的反革命性质等问题，并且说明反革命暴乱使国民收入减少了一百二十亿福林。他说，有人把现在生活水平的提高要归功于10月23日事件的这种说法是可笑的。生活水平的提高应该归功于社会主义国家，这些国家的人民节衣缩食来帮助我们克服困难。但要彻底克服困难，只有依靠自己的努力。他指出，现在，反革命分子的策略改变了，他们企图在经济上来进行破坏，制造困难，阻止建设工作的展开。比斯库最后说，我们要以全力来加强工农联盟，加强这个联盟的领导力量——工人阶级的革命政党。
    罗奈伊在第二十区群众大会上的讲话中说，青年仍不懂得旧匈牙利的法西斯和反革命是什么，我们做父母的人有责任弥补这一缺陷。要告诉孩子们，是工农大众的艰苦劳动为他们创造了学习的条件。他还说，作家和艺术家要多给人们好的精神食粮，教师要好好教育年青一代。
