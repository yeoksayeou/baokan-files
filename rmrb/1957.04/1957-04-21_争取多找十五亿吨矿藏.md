Strive to Find 1.5 Billion More Tons of Mineral Deposits

    This year, Shanxi Province's geological survey task is larger than any previous year. There are approximately 500 survey personnel scattered throughout the mountains and fields. This year, in addition to completing the exploration of 4,500 square kilometers of coalfields, a general survey of 7,450 square kilometers of coalfields, a preliminary survey of more than 2,000 square kilometers of coalfields, and determining coal reserves of 3.6 billion tons, they must also search for large quantities of metallic minerals such as iron, manganese, and copper.
    By early April, sixteen geological survey teams had successively entered the Taihang Mountains, Zhongtiao Mountains, Lüliang Mountains, and other remote mountains. As soon as fieldwork began, the members of eleven coalfield geological survey teams launched a production increase and economy campaign to find an additional 1.5 billion tons of proven reserves using existing national investment.

    争取多找十五亿吨矿藏
    山西省今年地质普查任务比过去任何一年都大。分布在山野里的普查人员大约有五百多人。今年他们除了要完成四千五百平方公里的煤田查勘任务、七千四百五十平方公里的煤田概查、二千多平方公里的煤田普查和得出三十六亿吨煤的储量以外，还要寻找大量铁、锰、铜等金属矿产。
    到4月上旬，已经有十六个地质普查队先后进入太行山、中条山、吕梁山等人迹罕见的大山里。十一个煤田地质普查队的队员们，野外工作一开始就展开了一个利用国家现有投资，多找十五亿吨普查储量的增产节约运动。（据新华社讯）
