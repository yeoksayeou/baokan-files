Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, April 4th: The Jiangxi Province held its Sixth Session of the First People's Congress from March 29th to April 2nd. The meeting focused on discussing how Jiangxi Province should comprehensively launch a large-scale increase production and practice economy campaign this year, strive for a bumper harvest in agricultural production, and ensure the completion and strive for over-fulfillment of the various plans for 1957.

Around this spirit, the meeting summarized the achievements and shortcomings in the work of 1956, and on this basis, determined Jiangxi Province's national economic plan for 1957. This plan is: basic construction investment and financial expenditure will be appropriately compressed compared with 1956; however, the total output value of agriculture and sideline industries is required to increase by about 14% compared with 1956; the total output value of local industries is required to increase by 9.85% compared with 1956.

In order to ensure the successful completion of this plan, the Jiangxi Province decided to conduct extensive and in-depth political and ideological education on increasing production and practicing economy among cadres at all levels and the broad masses of people. In terms of agricultural production, seize the current spring plowing season and organize an agricultural increase production campaign that is more extensive, more in-depth, and more down-to-earth than last year. In the province's industrial production and basic construction departments, mobilize workers to further develop the advanced producer movement, and do everything possible to increase the production of raw materials and conserve raw materials. For new projects and continued projects that have been included in the 1957 construction plan, conduct another review of the design documents to ensure both quality and savings.

The meeting emphasized that governments at all levels in the province must strengthen specific guidance on the increase production and practice economy campaign from beginning to end, promote the fine tradition of sharing weal and woe with the masses, and mobilize all the active forces of the people of the province. It is also necessary to criticize and fight against extravagance and waste, corruption and degeneration, and violations of law and discipline in government agencies.

    江西省人民代表大会举行会议
    决定大力开展增产节约运动
    据新华社南昌4日电　江西省在3月29日至4月2日召开了第一届人民代表大会第六次会议。会议着重讨论了今年江西省如何全面地掀起一个规模宏大的增产节约运动，力争今年农业生产的大丰收，保证完成和争取超额完成1957年的各项计划的问题。
    围绕着这一精神，会议总结了1956年工作中的成绩和缺点，并在这个基础上确定了江西省1957年的国民经济计划。这计划是：基本建设投资和财政支出比1956年有适当的压缩；但是，农、副业总产值要求比1956年增长14％左右；地方工业总产值要求比1956年增长9.85％。
    江西省为了保证这一计划的胜利完成，会议决定在全省各级干部和广大人民群众中，广泛、深入地进行增产节约的政治思想教育。在农业生产方面，抓紧当前的春耕季节，组织一个比去年更加广泛、更加深入、更加踏实的农业增产运动。在全省的工业生产和基本建设部门，发动职工，进一步开展先进生产者运动，要千方百计地增产原材料，节约原材料。对已列入1957年建设计划的新项目和续建项目，再进行一次设计文件的审查工作，做到既保证质量又能节约。
    会议强调了全省各级政府必须自始至终地加强对增产节约运动的具体指导，发扬与群众共甘苦的优良作风，把全省人民的积极力量都调动起来。并要对机关中的铺张浪费、贪污腐化和违法乱纪的现象，进行批评和斗争。
