Based on the above requirements, the following provisions are made for this year's college and university enrollment:

    Graduates of senior high schools that have established a health record card system, if they have already undergone examinations and lung fluoroscopy in accordance with the regulations, may not need to be re-examined.

    2. Peking University, Tsinghua University, Harbin Institute of Technology, Jiaotong University, Beijing Agricultural University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Medical College, and other seven universities enroll students from all over the country; military, national defense industry, and diplomatic colleges and universities, and other some colleges and universities, need to recruit some students from other regions due to the particularity of their majors, which shall be separately stipulated by the National College and University Enrollment Committee.
    3. Other colleges and universities other than the above-mentioned nature should, in principle, enroll students within the scope of the original Greater Administrative Region.
    4.

    IX. In order to facilitate the college and university enrollment work and take care of the convenience of candidates' application, candidates whose location (referring to the graduating school, work unit, or place of permanent residence) has an examination area are limited to applying for the examination in the examination area; candidates whose location does not have an examination area can apply for the examination in a nearby examination area. Students from Hong Kong and Macau apply for the examination in Guangzhou.
    Individual candidates who have a certain professional foundation or specialty, and there is no corresponding college or university enrollment in their region, may apply for the corresponding major or department of a college or university in another region with the approval of the College and University Enrollment Working Committee or the examination area office of the province, autonomous region, or municipality where they are located.

    Candidates who meet the above conditions should submit a certificate letter from the relevant unit regarding the above conditions.
    XI. In order to further take care of the candidates' aspirations, colleges and universities will generally not adopt the method of planned allocation when enrolling new students this year. Schools that cannot enroll enough students according to the candidates' filled-in aspirations will take the method of soliciting volunteers from the candidates or holding the enrollment examination again to complete the enrollment task.
    XII. Candidates should be loyal and honest to the country, and must not forge certificates or falsely report academic qualifications, experiences, or conceal political history and other errors. Otherwise, once discovered, the qualification for application or admission shall be immediately cancelled.
    XIII. Admitted new students should go to the school within the time specified by the admitting school. Those who fail to report to the school after the deadline will have their admission qualification cancelled according to the regulations of the admitting school.
    XIV. Colleges and universities should conduct a health re-examination after new students enter the school; those who fail the re-examination shall not retain their student status. However, for some new students with less severe conditions, who are estimated to be able to recover their health within a certain period of time, the school may consider retaining their admission qualification for one year.
    XV. In principle, the travel expenses for new students to go to school should be borne by themselves; a small number of students who are unable to raise the travel expenses to go to school due to the long distance to school may apply for subsidies from the College and University Enrollment Working Committee of the province, autonomous region, or municipality or the local education administrative department.
    XVI. The specific methods for the unified college and university enrollment work shall be formulated separately by the National College and University Enrollment Committee. Colleges and universities that enroll students separately should formulate specific methods for enrollment work based on these regulations and in conjunction with the specific conditions of the school, and implement them after being approved by the National College and University Enrollment Committee.

    十六、高等学校统一招生工作的各项具体办法，由全国高等学校招生委员会另行制订。单独招生的高等学校，应该根据本规定，并结合本校的具体情况，制订招生工作的各项具体办法，经全国高等学校招生委员会审批后执行。
