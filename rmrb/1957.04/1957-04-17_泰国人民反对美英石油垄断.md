Thai People Oppose American and British Oil Monopoly
Shu Yun
Before World War II, Western oil companies controlled Thailand's oil. After the war, American monopoly capital invaded Thailand in large quantities under the guise of "aid." In order to monopolize the Thai oil market, with the signing of the "Anglo-Siamese Treaty" in 1946, "Mobil Oil Company" and "Shell Oil Company" forced the Thai authorities to sign a contract of enslavement oil. According to this contract, the two companies bought Thailand's only oil refinery (the Fuel Bureau's oil factory), worth tens of millions of baht, at a low price of eight million baht, and rented 300 rai of land (each rai equals 100 square wah) belonging to Nanfeng Wang in the Bangkok area at a low price of one baht per square wah, with a lease term of 30 years. The contract also stipulated that the railway station, pier and other equipment related to oil transportation in the above-mentioned areas must be leased to these two companies. The signing of this contract provided American and British imperialists with a basis for legally plundering the Thai people. Thai Defense Minister Nai Salit once said: "I know very well that this contract is unfair to us, because we signed it under pressure."

The imperialists, who came to Thailand with the "philanthropic" posture of "aiding" and "developing" backward areas, began their "development" work after the contract was signed. Mobil Oil Company and Shell Oil Company began to dismantle Thailand's oil refinery and sold some of the equipment as scrap iron. The money obtained from selling the chimney alone as scrap iron reached about 8 million baht, which is equivalent to the total value of the American and British oil companies' purchase of the plant.

Mobil Oil Company and Shell Oil Company artificially created an oil panic for the oil-deficient Thais. The Thai government had to ask the American and British oil companies to supply oil. This was in line with the intentions of the imperialists, and the two oil companies did not hesitate to put forward the following three conditions:
	1. After the oil is imported, the Thai Fuel Bureau must stop selling oil except for the oil supplied to government agencies;
	2. If any enterprise wants to engage in the oil business, Fuel Bureau personnel are not allowed to participate in the business;
	3. If any company is established to engage in the oil business, the government or government agencies are not allowed to hold shares.

In this way, American and British oil companies completely monopolized the Thai oil market and squeezed a lot of blood and sweat from the Thai people every year. The Thai government not only has no right to control its own oil market, but also has to pay a heavy price.

At present, Thailand's oil consumption is increasing by about 10% every year, and the annual consumption of oil is about 1.825 billion baht. Due to the monopoly of American and British oil companies, a large amount of profits flowed into the pockets of imperialists like running water, and the foreign exchange Thailand spends on oil consumption every year is almost equal to the total value of Thailand's main agricultural product, rice, exported every year.

According to the statistics of Thailand's "Economic Bi-Weekly" special New Year's Day issue this year, the total direct investment of the United States in Thailand is 16,596,236 US dollars (equivalent to 331,924,720 baht), of which the actual capital invested by Mobil Oil Company and Texaco Oil Company is no less than 10 million US dollars (equivalent to 200 million baht). From 1950 to August 1956, the profits of Shell Oil Company, Mobil Oil Company and Texaco Oil Company reached 99,218,395 US dollars (equivalent to 1,984,367,900 baht). The profits in the first eight months of 1956 alone reached 17,647,353 US dollars (equivalent to 352,947,060 baht). In more than six years, the profits of these three companies have exceeded six times the amount of investment.

The Thai people are extremely indignant at this plunder by imperialism and have demanded that the Thai government revise this extremely unequal oil contract. Newspapers and public opinion circles also oppose the American and British monopoly of the Thai oil market and demand the development of free trade between countries. Under the pressure of the people, the Thai government had to set up a committee in May last year to review the contract. Negotiations on revising the contract began in August last year. Under the strong accusations of the Thai people, the imperialists had to make concessions. On February 26 this year, the Thai government and American and British oil companies signed a new contract, canceling the American and British oil companies' monopoly on Thailand's oil trade. According to the new contract, the Thai government's oil and fuel agencies have the right to conduct free trade, and the rent for the land leased by the Thai government to the American and British oil companies will be increased from the low price of one baht per square wah to twelve baht. The lease term of the land will also be reduced by fifteen years from that stipulated in the old contract. After the expiration date, the American and British oil companies can only renew the lease for another twelve years (previously it was thirty years). The Thai government has the right to recover the leased land that the American and British oil companies have not yet used after the contract takes effect.

This is a preliminary victory for the Thai people against the American and British oil monopoly. This victory will be an encouragement to the Thai people's struggle against imperialist control of the Thai oil market and for national independence.

    泰国人民反对美英石油垄断
    舒云
    第二次世界大战以前，西方石油公司就控制着泰国的石油。战后，美国垄断资本又以“援助”为名大量侵入泰国。为了垄断泰国的石油市场，随着1946年“英暹条约”的签订，“美孚石油公司”和“壳牌石油公司”强迫泰国当局签订了一项奴役性的石油合同。根据这项合同，这两家公司以八百万铢的低价收买了泰国价值几千万铢的唯一的一个炼油厂（燃料局的石油工厂），以每平方哇一铢的低价租借了属于曼谷地区的南风王的地皮三百莱（每莱等于一百哇），租期三十年。合同还规定必须将上述地区的火车站、码头以及其他与运输石油有关的设备出租给这两家公司。这项合同的签订，给美、英帝国主义者提供了合法掠夺泰国人民的依据。泰国国防部长乃沙立曾说：“我十分清楚地知道，这项合同对我们是不公平的，因为我们是在受到压力的情况下签订了这项合同。”
    以“援助”和“开发”落后地区的“慈善家”姿态来到泰国的帝国主义者，在合同签订以后便开始了他们的“开发”工作。美孚石油公司与壳牌石油公司动手拆毁了泰国这个炼油厂，并将其中的一部分设备当废铁出卖。仅仅烟囱一项当废铁出卖所得到的钱就达八百万铢左右，相当于美英石油公司收买该厂的总值。
    美孚石油公司和壳牌石油公司又给本来就缺油的泰国人为地造成了石油恐慌。泰国政府不得不向美英石油公司提出供应石油的要求。这正合帝国主义者的意图，这两家石油公司也就毫不犹豫地提出了以下三个条件：
      1、当石油输入以后，泰国燃料局除了供给政府机关的石油以外必须停止出售石油；
      2、如有任何企业要经营石油时，不许燃料局人员参加经营；
      3、如成立任何公司以经营石油时，不许政府或政府机关持有股份。
    这样，美英石油公司便完全垄断了泰国的石油市场，每年榨取泰国人民的大量血汗。泰国政府不但无权支配本国的石油市场，反而要付出大量的代价。
    目前，泰国的石油消费量，逐年增加约10％，每年消费的石油约达十八亿二千五百万铢。由于美英石油公司的垄断，大量的利润像流水一样地流进了帝国主义者的腰包，而泰国每年花费在石油消费方面的外汇，几乎等于泰国主要农产品大米每年输出的总值。
    据泰国“经济半月刊”今年元旦特大号的统计，美国在泰国的直接投资共为一千六百五十九万六千二百三十六美元（合三万三千一百九十二万四千七百二十铢），而其中美孚石油公司和德士古石油公司所投下的实际资本已不下一千万美元（合二亿铢）。自1950年到1956年8月，壳牌石油公司、美孚石油公司和德士古石油公司的营利达九千九百二十一万八千三百九十五美元（合十九亿八千四百三十六万七千九百铢）。仅1956年头八个月的利润已达一千七百六十四万七千三百五十三美元（合三亿五千二百九十四万七千零六十铢）。六年多以来，这三家公司所得的利润竟超过了投资额的六倍以上。
    泰国人民对帝国主义的这种掠夺感到极大的愤慨，纷纷要求泰国政府修改这一极不平等的石油合同。报纸和舆论界也反对美英垄断泰国的石油市场，要求开展各国间的自由贸易。在人民的压力之下，去年5月间泰国政府不得不成立一个委员会来审查这项合同。去年8月起举行了修改合同的谈判。在泰国人民强烈的指责之下，帝国主义者不得不作了让步。今年2月26日，泰国政府和美英石油公司签订了新的合同，取消了美英石油公司对泰国石油贸易的垄断。根据新的合同，泰国政府的石油燃料机构有权自由进行贸易，泰国政府出租给美英石油公司的土地的租金将由每平方哇一铢的低价增加为十二铢。土地的租期也将比旧合同中所规定的减少十五年。期满后，美英石油公司只能再续租十二年（过去是三十年）。而泰国政府在合同生效后就有权收回美英石油公司还没有动用的租地。
    这是泰国人民反对美英石油垄断的一个初步胜利。这个胜利对泰国人民反对帝国主义控制泰国石油市场和争取民族独立的斗争将是一个鼓舞。
