    After Reading "A Communist Party Member's Extra Income"
    After reading the article "A Communist Party Member's Extra Income," I was deeply moved. This issue, on the surface, seems unremarkable, but there are many issues worth pondering. Just as Comrade Li Wenxiao said, "It is clearly an unreasonable phenomenon," why do "Communist Party members turn a blind eye and take the money?" The Party requires us Party members to not forget four words when dealing with any issue – "Communist Party member." Why do some comrades forget this when dealing with matters related to personal interests?
    This is an article with educational significance. Recently, I encountered a similar problem at the Tangshan Steel Plant. The full-time cadres of the Party Committee, Trade Union, and Communist Youth League organizations of this plant all enjoyed the production task completion bonus. The average bonus per person per quarter was higher than that of production workers, technicians, and staff. Taking the plant's bonus expenditure in the fourth quarter of 1956 as an example: 3,749 workers received an average of 16 yuan and 7 fen per person, accounting for 7.27% of their total wages, while 67 full-time cadres of the Party, League, and Trade Union received an average of more than 49 yuan per person, accounting for 16.04% of their total wages. This issue, on the surface, is the same as the problem encountered by Comrade Yin Yonglin, and there is nothing surprising about it. However, if viewed from the essence of the issue, it is probably inappropriate. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said in his report on revising the Party Constitution when talking about abolishing the reward system: "Fundamentally speaking, we Communist Party members do not work for rewards. We work for the interests of the people. When our work is correct and diligent, and therefore we gain the trust of the people, this is the highest reward for a Communist Party member." When talking about whether the Party has no rewards for Party members at all, he said: "Of course, this does not mean that the Party does not notice the outstanding achievements of many excellent Party members in their work. The Party introduces their deeds and experiences, and the Party selects them for important positions according to their character and ability. These are all rewards from the Party." According to the above principles, I believe that the full-time cadres of the Party organizations, trade unions, and Communist Youth League organizations in factories and mines should not enjoy the factory's production task completion bonus. If full-time cadres of the Party Committee, Trade Union, and Communist Youth League organizations should receive material rewards, they should also be issued by their direct superiors within the system, and should not be taken from the factory. Therefore, it is inappropriate for the full-time cadres of the Party Committee, Trade Union, and Communist Youth League organizations of the Tangshan Steel Plant to enjoy the factory's bonus; not to mention that the bonus they receive is higher than that of production workers and technicians. I believe that this kind of income is essentially also "extra income."

### 读了“一个共产党员的额外收入”以后

    读了“一个共产党员的额外收入”以后
    我读了“一个共产党员的额外收入”一文之后，非常感动。这个问题从表面上看，似乎没有什么奇怪，其实有许多问题是值得深思的。正如李文孝同志所说的“明明是不合理的现象”，为什么“共产党员开眼闭眼拿钞票”呢？党要求我们党员无论处理什么问题都不要忘记四个字——“共产党员”。为什么在处理关系到个人利益的时候，有些同志却忘记了这一点呢？
    这是带有教育意义的文章。最近我在唐山钢厂也碰到了类似的问题。这个厂的党委会、工会和青年团组织的脱产干部都享得了完成生产任务奖。每人每季平均得奖数都高于生产工人、技术人员和职员。以这个厂1956年第四季度奖金开支情况为例：三千七百四十九名工人，每人平均得十六元零七分，占他们所得工资总额的7.27％，而党、团、工会脱产干部六十七人，每人平均就得四十九元多，占他们所得工资总额的16.04％。这个问题，从表面看，同殷永林同志遇到的问题一样，没有什么可以诧异的。但如果从问题的本质来看，恐怕不大妥当。邓小平同志在修改党章的报告中谈到取消奖励规定时说：“从根本上说，我们共产党员不是为奖励而工作的。我们是为人民群众的利益而工作。当我们的工作是正确的努力的，因而我们得到了人民群众的信任的时候，这对于共产党员说来，就是最高的奖励”。在谈到党对党员是否根本就没有奖励的问题时说：“这当然不是说，党没有注意到许多优秀的党员在工作中的出色的成就。党介绍了他们的事迹和经验，党按照他们的品格和能力，选拔他们到重要的工作岗位上去。这些都是党对于他们的奖励”。按照以上所说的道理，我认为厂矿企业内党组织及工会、青年团组织的脱产干部，都是不应享得工厂的完成生产任务奖金的。党委、工会、青年团组织的脱产干部如果应得到物质奖励时，也应该由本系统的直接上级发给，不应该取于工厂。因此，唐山钢厂的党委会、工会、青年团组织的脱产干部享得工厂的奖金是不恰当的；更不用说所得奖金高于生产职工和技术人员了。我认为，这种收入本质上也是“额外收入”。　　李玉生
