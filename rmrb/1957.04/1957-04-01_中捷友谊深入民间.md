Sino-Czech Friendship Deepens Among the People
    Qin Wen

    Last year, during the commemoration of the 20th anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's death, Dr. Berta Krebsová, a professor of Chinese language from Czechoslovakia, and Mr. Štefan Žalud, a professor of Oriental literature, traveled to Zhejiang. I accompanied them from Hangzhou to Shaoxing to visit the Lu Xun Memorial Hall. Dr. Krebsová speaks fluent Chinese; we talked intimately and learned that she had visited Shaoxing in 1954. She told me that she runs the Lu Xun Library in Prague, which has 50,000 Chinese books. "A Call to Arms" was translated into Czech and published in Prague in 1937. Dr. Krebsová has translated many of Mr. Lu Xun's works and has also written papers on his writings. Knowing that my second child was struggling to learn Czech due to the lack of a suitable dictionary, she introduced me to Comrade Stanislav, her student in Beijing who was working on a "Chinese-Czech Dictionary." Soon after, my child wrote to say that he had received help from Comrade Stanislav.

    During the winter vacation, when my child returned home to Hangzhou, he received a letter from his classmate saying that their teacher, Maria’s husband, a non-ferrous metal expert, was coming to Hangzhou and wanted to visit our home. At first, I thought he was coming for sightseeing and needed someone to accompany him, so he wanted to come to our home. However, a phone call from the Dahua Hotel informed us that the expert would only visit our home at 7:30 PM on the eve of his departure from Hangzhou, which proved my guess of "finding someone to accompany him for sightseeing" wrong. He was the chief engineer from the Czechoslovakian Embassy, who came to Hangzhou on business and took time out of his busy schedule to visit. In addition to tea and snacks, I prepared a record player, thinking that if we had little to talk about, I could play some of our folk music. However, this record player was not used. He said that it was not that he didn't want to listen to our folk music, but talking was more important. He didn't talk much to me but always faced my second child. This child initially stammered and couldn't answer well in Czech, appearing a bit embarrassed. Due to the expert's warm encouragement and patient guidance, he gradually became bolder and answered naturally; sometimes, when he couldn't translate, he would look it up in his notes. Looking at the expert's earnest and kind expression, I suddenly realized with admiration that he had intentionally created an opportunity for this child to be an interpreter by taking time out of his busy schedule to visit. This child had only studied Czech for a short time, and his foundation was not very good; however, a large number of Czechoslovakian experts were about to arrive, and translation work would have to begin. The expert's visit was not so much to examine his wife's teaching results, but rather to give my child a lesson on behalf of his wife; he was responsible for his wife's students, responsible for the exchange of Sino-Czech culture, for the people's cause, and for world peace.

    "He said it right, I understand!" The expert would occasionally turn to my wife and me, showing a proud and joyful expression, indicating that my child's translation was correct. Out of sincere gratitude, I said before parting, "I will visit you in Beijing in the future!"

    When they learned that I was coming to the capital for a meeting, Mr. and Mrs. Maria invited me to their home. Mr. Maria also felt like an old friend at first sight. She treated me so warmly, continuously offering me fruits, pastries, candies, and black tea. Her hands and mouth seemed to never stop. Both the husband and wife wore glasses, and their eleven-year-old child also wore glasses, obviously, nearsightedness is hereditary. My child told me that his beloved enamel knife had been given to this little friend; this is a demonstration of true friendship. Our two countries, even between children, have established a deep friendship. We talked and laughed non-stop for more than an hour, talking about Julius Fučík, the scenery of Beijing and Hangzhou, Dr. Krebsová, etc., and also about the Peking opera they had just seen at Huairentang: "Monkey... fan," Mr. Maria gestured. I knew it was "Flame Mountain," so I briefly told the story of "Tang Sanzang's Journey to the West." I said, "That night we heard Chairman Mao's speech at Huairentang, because we were holding an evening party to invite you to watch the opera, we rushed out of the east side door, and it took us a long time to find a car!" Then we laughed together, feeling even closer. I don't understand Czech, and the subtle and intricate meanings can be mutually understood, thanks to the three students who have only learned Czech for six months; this is Mr. Maria's achievement. After leaving, the child accompanied me to the Beijing Hotel to visit Comrade Stanislav, who warmly welcomed me when she learned that I was a friend of Dr. Krebsová. From the large and complex number of books displayed on the bookshelf and spread out on the desk in her room, it can be seen her efforts and intensity in writing dictionaries and other works. This reminded me of what Mr. Maria had conveyed through the child: "We Czechs are few in number, so everyone must work very hard." These few people have already done a lot of work for the exchange of Sino-Czech culture. I expressed my deep gratitude to Comrade Stanislav for her contribution to the exchange of Sino-Czech culture and her care for my child, and she smiled happily, saying "Not at all." When I was talking to Mr. Maria, her husband interjected, "Chinese culture was indeed very developed long ago." He had the same expression when I said, "But we now need your help in science." While going downstairs, I thought to myself: In less than two hours, I had visited two Czech good friends in succession, and also mentioned many other Czech friends, all of whom left me with very good impressions. It can be seen that the friendship between China and Czechoslovakia has already penetrated into the hearts of the people!

    中捷友谊深入民间
    钦文
    去年纪念鲁迅先生逝世二十周年的时候，捷克斯洛伐克中国语言教授别尔查·克列布索娃博士和东方文学教授什捷凡·扎利先生同道到浙江；我从杭州陪他们到绍兴去参观鲁迅纪念馆。克列布索娃博士能流畅地讲中国话；我们谈得很亲密，知道她于1954年曾经到过绍兴。她告诉我她在布拉格办理鲁迅图书馆，那里有着五万册中文书籍。“呐喊”于1937年就翻译成捷文在布拉格出版。克列布索娃博士翻译过许多鲁迅先生的著作，也写过关于鲁迅先生著作的论文。她知道我的第二个孩子在学习捷克斯洛伐克语言苦于没有适当的字典，就介绍了她的在北京著“中捷字典”的学生斯丹尼同志。不久我的孩子来信，说是已经得到了斯丹尼同志的帮助。
    寒假中我这孩子回到杭州家中时接到他同学的信，说他们先生马丽亚的丈夫有色金属专家要来杭州，也要到我家来访问。当初以为他来游玩，要找个人陪陪，所以要来我家。可是大华饭店来电话通知，这位专家要在离开杭州的前夕七点半钟才来我家访问，我的“找人陪游”的猜想是不对的。他是捷克斯洛伐克大使馆里的总工程师，有事情到杭州来，是忙中抽空来访问的。我于茶点以外备了个唱机，以为少有话可谈的时候不妨请他听听我国的民间音乐。可是这个唱机，并不得用。他说并非不要听我国的民间音乐，只是谈谈更要紧。他并不和我多讲话，老是面向着我的第二个孩子。这孩子当初吃吃地回答不好捷克斯洛伐克话，显得有点窘。由于专家的热情安抚，耐心启发，渐渐地他大胆起来，回对得很自然了；有时翻译不出，就去查一查讲义。我看着这位专家认真、和蔼的神情，于钦佩中忽然感悟着：他于百忙中抽出时间来访问，是有意给这孩子来个当翻译员的机会的。这孩子学习捷文的时间还短，基础又并不好；可是大批的捷克斯洛伐克专家即将来到，翻译工作就得开始。这位专家的来访，与其说是为着考查他爱人教学的成绩，不如说是来替他的爱人给我的孩子补一课；他对于他爱人的学生负责，对于中捷文化的交流负责，为着人民的事业，为着世界的和平。
    “他说的，我明白！”专家不时地转向我和我的爱人说，现着得意喜悦的神情，表示我孩子的翻译是对的了。由于衷心的感激，临别我说，“将来上北京，我去看你们！”
    这次我来首都开会，马丽亚先生夫妇知道以后就邀请我到他们家里去玩。马丽亚先生也是一见如故。她招待我得这样热情，接连地把水果、糕饼、夹心糖和红茶递给我。她的手和嘴巴，好像一直没有停息过。他们夫妇都戴着眼镜，他们的十一岁的孩子也戴着眼镜，显然，近视是遗传的。我的孩子告诉我，他的心爱的珐琅小刀已经送给这位小朋友；这是真情友好的表现。我们中捷两国，连小孩子之间，也已建立起了深厚的友谊。有说有笑一忽不停地谈了一个多钟头，谈到尤利乌斯·伏契克，谈到北京和杭州的景物，谈到克列布索娃博士等，也谈到他们刚在怀仁堂看到的京剧：“猴子……扇子”，马丽亚先生做着手势说。我知道演的是“火焰山”，就扼要地讲了“唐僧取经”的故事。我说“那天晚上我们在怀仁堂听毛主席讲话，因为要举行晚会请你们看戏，我们匆匆出东边的便门，弄得许久找不到车子呢！”于是相互大笑，觉得更加亲密了。我不懂捷文，细微曲折的意思，能够相互了解，无非靠三个都还只学得六个月捷文的学生；这是马丽亚先生的成绩。别后孩子又陪我到北京饭店去访斯丹尼同志，她知道了我是克列布索娃博士的朋友，就热情地招待了我。从她房间里书架上陈列着的和案桌上摊着的书籍的多而复杂，可见她著字典等工作的努力和紧张。这使我记起来了曾由孩子传达马丽亚先生的话：“我们捷克斯洛伐克人少，所以每个人都要很努力。”他们少数人，对于中捷文化的交流却已做了不少的工作。我对于斯丹尼同志在中捷文化交流上的贡献和照顾我的孩子深深地感激，也就向她表明了这情意，她“哪里哪里”地说着喜悦地微笑起来了。当我和马丽亚先生谈话，她的丈夫插嘴，“中国文化实在是早就很发达的。”我说“可是科学上现在要请你们来帮助”时他也是这样表情的。在下楼时我暗自想：不到两个钟头，我就这样接连到两处访见了捷克斯洛伐克的好朋友，还提到其他许多捷克斯洛伐克的朋友，都是印象很好的，可见中捷两国的友谊，已经深入民间了！
