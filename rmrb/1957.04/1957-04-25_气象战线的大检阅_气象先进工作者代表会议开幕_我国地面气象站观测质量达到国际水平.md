Xinhua News Agency report: The National Representative Meeting of Advanced Meteorological Workers opened in Beijing on the 22nd.

More than 170 representatives attended the meeting. They are outstanding figures among the more than 10,000 meteorological workers across the country. Some come from the Tanggula Mountains in Qinghai, more than 5,000 meters above sea level; some come from Weizhou Island, where the waves roll in the southern part of the motherland; some come from the cold Changbai Mountain forest area; some come from the Honghu Lake on the middle reaches of the Yangtze River; some come from the southwestern border of the motherland on the Tibetan Plateau; and some come from the boundless Inner Mongolia prairie.

Tu Changwang, Director of the Central Meteorological Bureau, delivered the opening speech. He said that this meeting is a grand review of the advanced workers in the meteorological field, to commend their achievements and contributions to the motherland, and to exchange and promote advanced experiences, so as to encourage and inspire meteorological personnel across the country to strive to successfully complete the country's first five-year plan and lay a solid foundation for the second five-year plan. Tu Changwang said that since liberation, fundamental changes have taken place in China's meteorological work: the development and construction of meteorological observatories (stations) has been quite rapid, and the quality is gradually improving. The number of meteorological observatories (stations) nationwide has increased more than twenty times compared with 1948 before liberation. The density and observation quality of ground meteorological stations have basically reached international standards. The construction speed of upper-air meteorological stations, which mark the level of modern meteorology, has also far surpassed that of many of the most developed capitalist countries. Due to the timely and increasingly accurate issuance of warnings for disastrous weather such as typhoons, cold waves, frosts, strong winds, and rainstorms, the losses caused by natural disasters to China's production and construction and the people's lives and property have been significantly reduced in recent years. He said that in order to better serve the socialist construction of the motherland, meteorological workers must strengthen their political and ideological training.

谢·马立克 [Xie. Malike], the Soviet consultant of the Central Meteorological Bureau, spoke at the opening ceremony. He congratulated the representatives attending the meeting on behalf of the staff of the Soviet Hydrometeorological Department. He introduced the recent situation and experience of Soviet meteorological work, and hoped that Chinese meteorological workers would achieve greater success in the future.

The heads of departments such as the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the Ministry of Forestry, the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of Aquatic Products, the Ministry of Food Industry, the Civil Aviation Administration of China, and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League also addressed the meeting to express their congratulations.

The meeting is expected to last for eight days, during which the representatives will introduce their model deeds and work experience. After the meeting, the representatives will also participate in the "May 1st" parade in the capital and receive the review of national leaders in Tiananmen Square.

    气象战线的大检阅
    气象先进工作者代表会议开幕  我国地面气象站观测质量达到国际水平
    据新华社讯　全国气象先进工作者代表会议22日在北京开幕。
    出席会议的代表有一百七十多人。他们是全国一万多名气象工作者中的优秀人物，有的来自拔海五千多公尺的青海唐古拉山，有的来自祖国南方海浪翻滚中的涠洲岛，有的来自寒冷的长白山林区，有的来自长江中游的洪湖边，有的来自西藏高原的祖国西南边境，有的来自一望无际的内蒙古大草原。
    中央气象局局长涂长望致开幕词。他说，这次会议是对气象界先进工作者进行一次大检阅，表彰他们的成绩和对祖国的贡献，交流和推广先进经验，以便鼓励和启发全国气象工作人员，为良好地完成国家第一个五年计划而奋斗，为第二个五年计划打下稳固的基础。涂长望说，解放以后，我国的气象工作发生了根本的变化：气象台（站）的发展建设相当迅速，质量也在逐渐提高。全国现有气象台（站）的数目比解放前夕的1948年增加了二十多倍，地面气象站的密度及观测质量已经基本上达到了国际水平，标志近代化气象水平的高空气象站的建站速度，也远远地赶过了许多最发达的资本主义国家。由于台风、寒潮、霜冻、大风、暴雨等灾害性天气预报警报的发布及时和准确率不断提高，几年来我国生产建设和人民的生命财产因自然灾害所造成的损失有了显著的减少。他说，为了使气象工作更好地为祖国的社会主义建设事业服务，气象工作者必须加强政治思想锻炼。
    中央气象局的苏联顾问谢·马立克在开幕式上讲了话。他代表苏联水文气象部门工作人员向出席会议的代表们祝贺。他介绍了苏联气象工作的近况和经验，希望中国气象工作者今后获得更大的成就。
    中国农业科学院、林业部、水利部、水产部、食品工业部、中国民用航空局、青年团中央委员会等部门的负责人，也都向大会致词祝贺。
    会议预计进行八天，代表们将在会上介绍自己的模范事迹和工作经验。会议闭幕后，代表们还将参加首都的“五一”游行，在天安门前接受国家领导人的检阅。
