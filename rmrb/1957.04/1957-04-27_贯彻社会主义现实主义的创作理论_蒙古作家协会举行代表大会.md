Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 26th: The Second Congress of the Mongolian Writers Association was held in Ulaanbaatar on the 25th.

Mongolian Party and government leaders Damba, Sürenjav and others attended the meeting. A Chinese writers delegation was also invited to attend the conference.

Senge, Chairman of the Mongolian Writers Association, reported on the work since the first congress. He said that in the past nine years, the Mongolian people have smoothly carried out the peaceful construction of two five-year plans. Writers have achieved success in reflecting the lives of the people and portraying the images of contemporary figures.

Senge also pointed out at the conference that some writers have not gone deep enough into life, resulting in monotonous works. Some works also excessively praised individuals and neglected the role of the Party and the masses. He urged writers to go deeper and reflect more on the achievements on the industrial, pastoral and other production fronts.

Next, the writer Rinchen introduced the literature of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries and the translation of foreign literature in Mongolia. He said that Mongolia has translated works from more than 50 countries in recent years. Chinese classical literature such as "Water Margin" and "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" already have translations in Mongolia.

Sürenjav read out the congratulatory letter from the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party to the conference on behalf of the Central Committee.

Su Jin-san presented gifts such as paintings by Qi Baishi to the Mongolian Writers Association on behalf of the Chinese Writers Association, at which time warm applause rang out throughout the venue.

    贯彻社会主义现实主义的创作理论
    蒙古作家协会举行代表大会
    据新华社乌兰巴托26日电　蒙古作家协会第二届代表大会25日在乌兰巴托举行。
    蒙古党和政府的领导人达姆巴、苏伦扎布等出席了大会。中国作家代表团也应邀参加大会。
    蒙古作家协会主席僧格在会上报告了自第一届大会以来的工作情况。他说，九年来蒙古人民顺利地进行着两个五年计划的和平建设。作家们反映人民生活、刻划当代人物的形象都有了成就。
    僧格在大会上同时指出有些作家们深入生活不够，因而作品千篇一律。还有的作品过多地颂扬了个人，忽视党和群众的作用。他要求作家深入下去，更多地反映工业、牧业等生产战线上的成就。
    接着，作家仁钦在会上介绍了苏联和人民民主国家的文学和蒙古翻译外国文学的情况。他说，蒙古近几年来已经翻译了五十多个国家的作品。中国的古典文学“水浒”、“三国演义”等在蒙古早就有了译本。
    苏伦扎布代表蒙古人民革命党中央委员会在会上宣读了党中央给大会的贺信。
    苏金伞代表中国作家协会将齐白石作的画等礼品送给蒙古作家协会，这时全场响起热烈的掌声。
