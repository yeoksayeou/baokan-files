Bookshelf and Trunk, Cabinet and Bed
    A professor recently purchased a piece of furniture, a bookshelf-cum-trunk, at the Nanjing Municipal Handicraft Production Cooperative's furniture exhibition. When upright, the furniture is a six-shelf bookcase, but when folded, it becomes a trunk. The professor said he has many books, which are very inconvenient to move, and this dual-purpose furniture makes him very satisfied.
    In this exhibition hall, many multi-purpose and movable furniture pieces are also on display. A writing desk, when upright, is a multi-compartment cabinet with two drawers and eight doors, and when unfolded, it is a single bed. Some cabinets look the same as usual, but when the cabinet door is pulled open and a desktop is pulled out from the middle, the cabinet door supports four legs, becoming a table for writing or eating. There is also a glass cabinet on top of this cabinet for books and sundries, and a green gauze cabinet for bowls, chopsticks, and side dishes. Many small children's beds are also made in a novel and ingenious way. Some small beds can also be used as children's dining tables; some small beds, when set up, have pillars on all four sides and even canopy frames, but when folded, they can be placed against the wall without taking up space.
    Ingenious carpenters have also designed a picnic table for picnickers. This picnic table, when folded, becomes a small box weighing five kilograms. In addition to four table legs, the box contains four canvas stools and can also hold some entertainment equipment. A chessboard is engraved on the tabletop for playing chess or cards.

    书架兼箱子　柜子兼床铺
    有一位教授，最近在南京市手工业生产社家具展览会上买去一只书橱兼箱子的家具。这个家具竖起来是一架六格书橱，折叠起来就是一只箱子。这位教授说，他有很多书，搬家时很不方便，这个两用家具使他非常满意。
    在这个展览室里，还陈列着许多一物数用和活动的家具。一只写字台，竖起来是一架二只抽屉八个门的多格橱，摊开来又是一张单人床。有些橱柜看来和平常一样，但是把橱门拉开，从中间抽出一张桌面，橱门撑起四只脚，就成一张桌子，可以写字，可以吃饭。这个橱顶上还有一格玻璃橱，可以放书籍和杂物，一格绿纱橱，可以放碗筷和小菜。许多小人床，做得也很新颖精巧。有的小床，可兼作小孩饭桌；有的小床，架起来四面有柱杆，还有帐子架子，但折叠起来，可以靠在墙边，不占地方。
    心灵手巧的木工们还为郊游者设计了一种野餐桌。这只野餐桌，折叠起来就成为五公斤重的小箱子，箱内除四只桌腿外，还有四只帆布小凳，并可装些娱乐用具。桌面上刻有棋盘，可以下棋，可以打朴克。
