    印度尼西亚陆军参谋长
    委托代表处理第二军区事件
    第二军区司令竟声明仍然由他负责
    据新华社讯　印度尼西亚陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安3日从巨港回到雅加达。他发表声明说，他已经委任哈散·卡辛中校代表他本人在规定范围内处理南苏门答腊第二军区发生的事件。他命令有关部队回到原驻兵营，停止动员非现役军人的行动，并且收回已经发出去的武器。他还禁止军人或平民就这一事件随便发表声明或公告。
    同日晚上，第二军区司令巴利安通过巨港电台发表声明说，第二军区对内对外仍然由第二军区司令负责。
    第二军区共有第五、第六两个步兵团，分驻巨港和楠榜。他们都已经宣布脱离第二军区的领导。
    雅加达“人民日报”4日报道，南苏门答腊第六团团长沃朗中校在3月30日宣布脱离第二军区的时候，曾经发表宣言指责巴利安中校“支持分裂活动”。宣言指出，巴利安等人参与了驱逐南苏门答腊省省长达努阿莫佐的阴谋，还参与了筹备召开“传统和习惯维持者代表大会”和成立“鹰委员会”的活动。
