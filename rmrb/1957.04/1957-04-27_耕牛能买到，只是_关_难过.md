	Plough Cattle Can Be Bought, But the "Gate" Is Hard to Pass
	In order to support agricultural production and strive for a bumper harvest in 1957, our Nanjing Yuhuatai District Supply and Marketing Cooperative sent full-time cadres and market trading personnel to various producing areas to purchase plough cattle. Some agricultural cooperatives had surplus cattle for sale, but local government officials said they were not allowed to be sold. The purchasing personnel felt that the cattle could be bought, but the "gate" was difficult to pass.
	After seeing the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council's instructions on the issue of draught animals on March 21st, especially after seeing Article 6, I felt particularly happy.
	The purchasing personnel returned from Jiujiang, passing through Anqing, and purchased nineteen head, hiring a boat to transport them to Nanjing. However, when passing through Dangtu County, Anhui Province, they were mistaken by the County Industry and Commerce Section and the Food Company as butcher cattle and detained. After veterinary inspection, only one of them was a butcher cow. Later, because our procedures were incomplete, we were asked to obtain a certificate from the Nanjing Third Commercial Bureau. Who knew that after the certificate was issued, they found various excuses to detain them. Although we had some shortcomings in our purchasing work and should be dealt with, if we calculate that each cow can plow an average of four mu of land per day, then from the time the incident occurred on March 24th, they could have plowed seventy-six mu of land per day. These people only know how to sit in the office and put on airs, but they don't think about those people who are carrying ropes on their backs, bending over and laboriously plowing the fields, waiting for these cattle to replace their heavy labor. We request the relevant departments to take effective measures quickly, plan for spring plowing production, and quickly release the plough cattle. Chen Dejin Yu Xiucai

### 耕牛能买到，只是“关”难过

    耕牛能买到，只是“关”难过
    我们南京市雨花台区供销社，为了支持农业生产，争取1957年大丰收，派出专职干部和市场交易人员到各产区去采购耕牛。一些农业社有余牛出卖，但当地政府工作人员说不准出卖。采购人员认为牛能买到，可是“关”不好过。
    3月21日看到党报发出中共中央和国务院关于耕畜问题的指示后，尤其看到第六条，心里感觉特别高兴。
    采购人员由九江回来路过安庆，收购了十九头，雇船装往南京。可是，路过安徽省当涂县的时候，被县工商科和食品公司误认为菜牛扣下。经兽医检验，其中只有一头是菜牛。后来因为我们的手续不全，要我们在南京市第三商业局开个证明。那知证明开来以后，他们又找各种借口加以扣留。虽然我们在收购工作中是有些缺点的，应该处理。可是，从3月24日事情发生以后，如果以每头牛每天平均能耕田四亩计算，每天能耕七十六亩田。这些人光知道坐在办公室里摆架子，却没想到那些身背绳索、弯腰曲背费劲地在耕地的人们，他们正等待着这些耕牛去代替他们繁重的劳动。我们要求有关部门迅速采取有效措施，为春耕生产打算，快把耕牛放回去。　陈德瑾　俞修才
