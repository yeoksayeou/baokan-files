Eliminate Farmers' Concerns About Late Marriage
To the Editor:
    Since the proposal to revise the marriage age was published in the newspapers, a phenomenon of "rush marriages" among young men and women has emerged in some areas. According to incomplete statistics from Yidu County, Shandong Province, 251 young couples registered for marriage in the half-month period from March 1 to March 15, an increase of 30% compared to the same period last year. According to investigations, among these 251 young couples, some girls are about to turn eighteen and are now rushing to register their marriage with the government, fearing the revision of the marriage age; some are not yet of marriageable age but are also requesting registration, saying: "Register first, then get married when we are old enough."
    The main reason for this phenomenon is that the vast majority of farmers do not have sufficient understanding of the harms of early marriage and the benefits of marrying later. Therefore, I suggest that we carry out extensive and in-depth publicity in rural areas on issues such as birth control and the undesirability of early marriage. Only on the basis of improved ideological understanding can we avoid the above-mentioned deviations. Yuan Zhongxiu

### 消除农民对迟婚的顾虑

    消除农民对迟婚的顾虑编辑同志：
    自从报纸上提出修改结婚年龄以后，有些地方产生了青年男女“突击结婚”的现象。据山东省益都县不完全统计：自3月1日至3月15日半个月时间内，就有二百五十一对青年男女登记结婚，比去年同一时期增多30％。据调查：在这二百五十一对青年男女当中，有的姑娘将满十八岁，现在怕修改结婚年龄，已到政府办理登记结婚手续；有的还不到结婚年龄，也要求登记，并说：
  “先登记，等够年龄时再结婚”。
    产生这一现象的原因，主要因为广大农民对早婚的害处，迟一点结婚的好处认识不足。因此，我建议要在农村中，对农民广泛深入地进行节制生育、结婚不宜过早等等问题的宣传，只有在思想认识提高的基础上，才能避免发生上述偏向。　袁忠修
