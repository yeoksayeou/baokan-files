    Kobe's "Flower Clock"
    Kobe, Japan, recently created a "flower clock." The clock face is the smoothly trimmed lawn in front of the Kobe City Hall, and its diameter is more than ten feet. The circumference of the clock face is composed of numbers made of seasonal flowers and plants. The giant hands are turned by machinery buried underground, rotating on time.

    神户的“花钟”
    日本神户最近制成了一个“花钟”。这个钟的钟面是修饰得很平整的神户市政府前面的草坡，它的直径在十英尺以上。钟面的四周是用应时花草组成的数字。巨大的指针由埋藏在地下的机器转动，按时周行。
