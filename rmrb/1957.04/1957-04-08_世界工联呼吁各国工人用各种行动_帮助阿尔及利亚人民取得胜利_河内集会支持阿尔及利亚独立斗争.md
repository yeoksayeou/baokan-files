Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 7th – The World Federation of Trade Unions issued a declaration here on the 6th, calling on workers and trade union organizations in all countries to take various measures to support the Algerian people. The declaration calls for the establishment of committees, the organization of meetings, the adoption of resolutions, the expression of workers' attitudes to the French authorities and the United Nations, and the adoption of all other measures to support the Algerian people and help them achieve victory in their struggle for national independence.

This appeal was issued for the "International Week of Action in Support of Algerian Workers and People" to be held from April 7th to 14th.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 7th – Seventy thousand citizens of Hanoi held a rally this afternoon in the square in front of the Hanoi Grand Theater to support the Algerian people's struggle for national independence. Ton Duc Thang, Chairman of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, Truong Chinh, member of the Politburo of the Vietnam Workers' Party, Hoang Quoc Viet, Chairman of the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor, and representatives of various parties and organizations in Hanoi attended the meeting.

Hoang Quoc Viet spoke at the meeting. He condemned the French colonialists for using weapons supplied by the United States to massacre the Algerian people. He said that if the French colonialists do not learn their lesson, they will suffer the same disastrous defeat as in Dien Bien Phu in Vietnam. Hoang Quoc Viet stated that the Vietnamese people must support the just struggle of the Algerian people with a lofty spirit of internationalism.

Ujina, secretary of the Algerian General Confederation of Labor, who came to Vietnam for a visit, then took the stage and was warmly welcomed by the masses present.

Ujina said that although France has deployed 600,000 invading troops in Algeria, the Algerian Liberation Army is still growing stronger and has liberated two-thirds of the land. Ujina said that despite the great victories achieved by the Algerian people, the Algerian people are still willing to seek a solution to the Algerian issue through peaceful negotiations on the basis of respecting national independence.

The meeting passed a letter to the Algerian people, guaranteeing that the Vietnamese people will use all means to help the Algerian people achieve victory.

    新华社布拉格7日电　世界工会联合会6日在这里发表宣言，呼吁各国工人和各工会组织采取各种措施，声援阿尔及利亚人民。宣言要求成立委员会、组织会议、通过决议、向法国当局和联合国表明工人的态度并且采取其他一切措施来声援阿尔及利亚人民，帮助他们取得争取民族独立的斗争的胜利。
    这个呼吁是为将要在4月7日到14日举行的“支援阿尔及利亚工人和人民国际行动周”而发出的。
    新华社河内7日电　河内七万市民今天下午在河内大戏院前面的广场上举行集会，支持阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立的斗争。越南祖国战线主席孙德胜、越南劳动党政治局委员长征、越南总工会主席黄国越以及河内各党派、团体的代表参加了大会。
    黄国越在大会上讲话。他谴责法国殖民者利用美国供给的武器屠杀阿尔及利亚人民。他说，法国殖民者如果不吸收教训，一定会遭到像在越南奠边府一样的惨败。黄国越表示越南人民一定要以崇高的国际主义精神，全力支持阿尔及利亚人民的正义斗争。
    远道来越南进行访问的阿尔及利亚总工会书记乌日那接着上台讲话，他受到到会群众的热烈欢迎。
    乌日那说，虽然法国已经在阿尔及利亚投入六十万侵略军队，但是阿尔及利亚解放军仍然日益壮大，并且解放了三分之二的土地。乌日那说，尽管阿尔及利亚人民已经取得了很大的胜利，阿尔及利亚人民仍然愿意在尊重民族独立的基础上，通过和平协商的办法来求得阿尔及利亚问题的解决。
    大会通过一封致阿尔及利亚人民的信，保证越南人民要用一切办法来帮助阿尔及利亚人民取得胜利。
