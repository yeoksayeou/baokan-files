    Celebrating the Water Splashing Festival in a Brotherly Country
    Wang Changyun
    On April 11th, the eve of the Burmese Water Splashing Festival, Liu Minghui, Acting Governor of Yunnan Province, China, and General Xie Fuzhi, commander of the Yunnan Military Region, arrived in Yangon at the invitation of Burmese Prime Minister U Nu. Prime Minister U Nu personally greeted them at the airport. He warmly said to the Chinese guests, "You are visiting not as ordinary guests but as our relatives. We cannot splash water on you like ordinary people, but we will immerse you in large buckets of water."
    According to Burmese astrologers, this year's Water Splashing Festival in Burma began at 4:18:16 PM on April 12th and ended at 8:22:56 PM on April 15th. According to folklore, the date and time of the Burmese Water Splashing Festival is the time when a deity named Thagyamin descends to inspect the world annually. The first day after the Water Splashing Festival is the Burmese New Year, so the Burmese Water Splashing Festival has the significance of "washing away the old and welcoming the new," cleansing the filth accumulated in the old year and welcoming the new year. On April 16th, the first day of the Burmese New Year, people carry silver or earthenware bowls on their heads to pagodas and temples, using small branches dipped in clear water to bathe the Buddha and sprinkle water on monks. Many young men and women also carry water bowls to the homes of elders to pay New Year's respects and sprinkle water to show respect for the elderly.
    On the evening of April 12th, the prelude to the water splashing began at the Prime Minister's residence. It was a cordial, warm, and unforgettable evening. Prime Minister U Nu and his wife held a homely banquet in their garden without diplomatic protocol. All the Chinese relatives wore Burmese national costumes. When Acting Governor Liu Minghui and General Xie Fuzhi arrived at the Prime Minister's residence, U Nu and his wife picked up water bowls and offered them blessings. The Chinese relatives then took bowls and splashed water back at U Nu and his wife, Daw Mya Yi, Minister U Tun Tin, and others. The members of the Yunnan Provincial Song and Dance Troupe sitting around the garden also joined in the water splashing. The water in the seven or eight large buckets placed around was soon emptied. Everyone was soaked, and droplets of water flowed down people's faces and heads like broken strings of pearls. After the water splashing came to an end, Daw Mya Yi and Daw Aung San, among others, brought bowls of spicy and delicious hot soup for the guests to eat. After eating the hot soup, Prime Minister U Nu invited Acting Governor Liu Minghui to dance a Burmese dance. Daw Mya Yi, General Xie Fuzhi, Ambassador Yao Zhongming, Daw Aung San, and other guests all danced together. Sometimes it was a Burmese duet, and sometimes it was a Chinese Yangko dance. Finally, all the hosts and guests danced a unity dance. The dancers held hands, shoulder to shoulder, stepping in the same rhythm, dancing in circles, dancing in long lines, enthusiastically dancing back and forth, left and right. After Prime Minister U Nu and his wife invited everyone to eat two hot dishes, the "water splashing battle" unfolded again enthusiastically. This time, Acting Governor Liu Minghui, General Xie Fuzhi, Prime Minister U Nu, and others were all successively lifted into large buckets, immersed in clear water symbolizing friendship and happiness.
    On the morning of the 13th, the two parade floats of the Yunnan Provincial Song and Dance Troupe decorated with dragons and phoenixes, and the parade float of the Chinese Economic Exhibition Hall filled with lifelike wax fruits and grapevines, toured the various districts of Yangon accompanied by Burmese Minister of Culture U Tun Tin. One float featured the Yunnan dance "Axi Jumping Moon," and the other played Burmese music. When the float arrived at the pavilion of the President's residence, President U Win Maung and his wife stood at the door waving to welcome the guests, splashing water on them, and also treating them with Burmese coconut juice. The surrounding crowds shouted "Long live Sino-Burmese friendship." The floats were warmly welcomed wherever they went.
    The Chinese guests, accompanied by Prime Minister U Nu and his wife, joined the citizens of Yangon in splashing water on the afternoons of the 13th and 15th. Prime Minister U Nu and his wife and the Chinese guests, all dressed in Burmese attire, rode in jeeps, draped in large towels, ready to greet the "water splashing battle." They visited more than a dozen pavilions in various districts of Yangon. One pavilion was decorated exceptionally well, with a surging waterfall flowing from an artificial mountain, with a hydroelectric power station erected in the distance behind the mountain, and twenty or thirty Burmese girls singing and dancing lightly on the mountain plateau. Long tables inside each pavilion displayed many silver cups and silver plaques. The judges inside the pavilion presented these silver cups and silver plaques to passing floats that were beautifully decorated and performed wonderfully. Large buckets of clear water were also placed next to each pavilion. Silver water bowls engraved with patterns and designs and many aluminum water bowls were also placed inside the pavilion.
    Every time the Chinese guests arrived at a pavilion, they were warmly welcomed by the hosts of the pavilion and received sprinkling with incense water from silver bowls by the hosts using small branches. Every time Prime Minister U Nu arrived at a pavilion, he would ask "How much water is prepared?" The water splashing frenzy in each pavilion was always started by Prime Minister U Nu, Acting Governor Liu Minghui, and General Xie Fuzhi. They first splashed each other, and then splashed water on the citizens, who also splashed back enthusiastically. They sang and danced together with the citizens, enjoying themselves to the fullest.
    Moulmein, a seaside city in southern Burma, has its own special customs. Just as the joyful Water Splashing Festival was ending in various parts of Burma, the Water Splashing Festival in Moulmein was not to reach its climax until April 16th. The Chinese guests arrived in Moulmein from Yangon on this day. The people of Moulmein were very warm and hospitable. Approximately 30,000 citizens gathered on a six-mile-long street to celebrate the festival and welcome the New Year. More than a thousand young women of Moulmein, divided into groups of about five or six to a dozen people, took silver or aluminum bowls and splashed water on passersby. Each group wore a different colored sarong and top. The parade float carrying the Chinese guests was often surrounded by layers of Moulmein citizens on the road. The float traveled on this road for three and a half hours, which is to say, they enthusiastically splashed water together with the people of Moulmein for three and a half hours. The float was like a ship in the ocean, constantly bombarded by the enthusiastic waves of friendly water. The Chinese guests also visited Yugo, a small village ten miles south of Moulmein City, according to the customs of the people of Moulmein. On April 16th, many people from the city went to Yugo to worship the pagoda. Pavilions were set up around the pagoda, and various cultural and entertainment programs were performed in the pavilions, including traditional Burmese boxing matches, Burmese song and dance, and so on. Acting Governor Liu Minghui and General Xie Fuzhi, among others, appreciated their outstanding performances together with thousands of people from Moulmein in these pavilions.
    During the Water Splashing Festival, the Chinese guests also went to Bago County, fifty miles away from Yangon, on the 14th to participate in the Shwemawdaw Pagoda Festival. On this day, Burmese President U Win Maung and thousands of people from Bago also came here to worship and celebrate. It is said that the Shwemawdaw Pagoda was first built 2,300 years ago, and has been rebuilt and expanded by successive dynasties after four earthquakes and collapses. In 1930, another huge earthquake destroyed the entire pagoda. After Burmese independence, the pagoda was rebuilt starting in April 1951 and completed at the end of 1953. Now, the Shwemawdaw Pagoda is the largest pagoda in the Union of Burma, second only to the Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon. The Chinese guests also visited the famous Reclining Buddha built in 1881 in Bago. This Reclining Buddha is 180 feet long and 35 feet high. It is said to be the largest Reclining Buddha in the world. The Chinese guests also watched performances of song and dance programs by famous Burmese artists. One of them was called "Unity is Victory," and the plot described two brothers who became discordant due to the instigation of a demon, but later understood the truth, united, and crushed the external alienation and sabotage. Prime Minister U Nu, Acting Governor Liu Minghui, and General Xie Fuzhi all greatly appreciated the performance and plot of this song and dance drama.
    The annual Burmese Water Splashing Festival has passed. The Chinese guests have now left Yangon to visit Upper Burma. In his farewell letter before leaving Yangon, Acting Governor Liu Minghui said that these days of visiting in a brotherly country were not ordinary days, but unforgettable days filled with warm emotions and profound significance. He firmly believed that under the shining light of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the traditional friendship between China and Burma would surely continue to blossom with brilliant flowers.

    在亲戚国家里欢度泼水节
    王昌运
    4月11日，缅甸泼水节的前夕，中国云南省代省长刘明辉和云南驻军首长谢富治上将应缅甸吴努总理的邀请，来到了仰光。吴努总理亲自到机场迎接。他对中国客人们热情地说道，“你们不是作为普通的客人而是作为我们的亲戚来访问的。我们不能像普通人那样向你们泼水，而是要把你们浸浴在大水桶里。”
    根据缅甸占星家的计算，缅甸今年的泼水节是在4月12日下午四时十八分十六秒降临，在15日下午八时二十二分五十六秒结束。据民间传说，缅甸泼水节的日期和时辰，正是一位名叫笛加敏的神仙每年一度降世巡视的时间。泼水节后的第一天就是缅甸的新年，因此缅甸的泼水节有着“涤旧迎新”的意义，洗掉旧的一年中所沾染的污秽，迎接新的一年。在4月16日，缅甸年初一这一天，人们头顶着银钵或瓦钵到金塔和寺庙去，用小树枝蘸着清水为佛浴身、为僧侣洒水。还有许多青年男女顶着水钵到长者家里去拜年洒水，以示敬老之意。
    4月12日的晚上，泼水的序幕在总理府揭开了。这是一个亲切、热烈而难忘的夜晚。吴努总理夫妇在他们的花园里举行了一个没有外交礼仪约束的家宴。中国亲戚们全部穿上了缅甸民族服装。当刘明辉代省长和谢富治将军等抵达总理府时，吴努夫妇拿起手边的水钵向他们表示祝福。中国亲戚们也接着取钵向吴努夫妇、昂山夫人、吴吞丁部长等回泼。坐在花园四周的云南省歌舞团团员们这时也参加了泼水。放在四周的七、八个大水桶里的水一会儿就被泼完了。每个人的身上都泼得湿淋淋的，滴滴水珠像断线珍珠似地从人们的脸上、头上流下来。泼水告一段落后，努夫人、昂山夫人等把一碗碗鲜辣味美的热汤端给客人们食用。吃完热汤以后，吴努总理找刘明辉代省长跳缅甸舞。努夫人同谢富治将军、姚仲明大使和昂山夫人以及其他宾主们都一起婆娑起舞。一会儿跳的是缅甸双人舞，一会儿又跳起中国的秧歌舞。最后，所有的主人和客人们大跳团结舞。跳舞的人们手挽手、肩并肩、脚踩着同一步伐，跳成圆圈、跳成长蛇、前后左右热情地舞蹈着。在吴努总理夫妇邀请大家吃了两道热菜后，“泼水战”又热烈地展开了。这一回刘明辉代省长、谢富治将军、吴努总理等都先后被抬入大水桶，浸浴在象征着友谊和幸福的清水中。
    13日上午，云南省歌舞团扎的两辆龙凤花车和中国经济展览馆的满放着色美如真的腊制水果和葡萄架的花车，在缅甸文化部长吴吞丁的陪同下，到仰光各区游览。一辆车上表演着云南舞蹈“阿细跳月”，一辆车上演奏着缅甸音乐。当花车抵达总统府彩棚时，吴温貌总统夫妇站在门口向客人招手欢迎，向他们泼水，并且还以缅甸的椰子汁招待客人。周围的群众高呼着“中缅友好万岁”。花车每到一处都受到热烈的欢迎。
    中国客人们，在吴努总理夫妇的陪同下，13日和15日下午同仰光市民在一起泼水。吴努总理夫妇和中国客人们全部缅甸装束，分乘吉普车，身披大毛巾，准备迎接“泼水战”。他们到仰光各区访问了十几个彩棚。有一个彩棚布置得非常出色，假山中奔流着澎湃的瀑布，山后的远方架设着水力发电站，二、三十个缅甸少女在山坪上轻歌曼舞。每一个彩棚内的长桌上都陈列着许多银杯银牌。棚内的评奖人把这些银杯银牌赠给路过的装饰美丽、表演精彩的花车。每一彩棚旁边也放着大桶清水。刻着图案和花纹的银水钵和许多铝制水钵也放在彩棚内。
    中国客人们每到一个彩棚，都受到彩棚主人们的热烈欢迎，并接受主人们用小树枝蘸着银钵内的香水的洒泼。吴努总理每到一个彩棚就问“准备了多少水？”每一个彩棚的泼水热潮总是由吴努总理、刘明辉代省长和谢富治将军掀起。他们首先是相互对泼，接着就向市民们泼水，市民们也热烈地回泼。同市民们一起载歌载舞，尽兴而止。
    位于缅甸南部的海边城市——毛淡棉有着它的特殊风俗习惯。正当缅甸全国各地结束了欢乐的泼水节时，毛淡棉的泼水节却要在4月16日才进入高潮。中国客人们在这一天从仰光赶到了毛淡棉。毛淡棉的人民十分热情好客。大约有三万多市民聚集在一条长达六英里的大街上庆贺佳节、迎接新年。一千多年轻的毛淡棉妇女，她们分成小组，每组约五、六人至十余人不等，手拿银钵或铝钵向路人泼水。每组各自穿着一种花色的纱笼和上衣。中国客人们坐的花车，经常在路上受到毛淡棉市民的层层包围。花车在这条路上走了三个半小时，也就是同毛淡棉人民在一起热烈地泼了三个半小时的水。花车好像海洋中的船只，不断地受到热情的友谊的水浪的泼击。中国客人们还按照毛淡棉人民的习惯，到毛淡棉市以南十英里的小村——尤果访问。在4月16日那一天，许多城里的人到尤果去朝拜佛塔。佛塔的周围搭起了彩棚，彩棚里表演着各种文化娱乐节目，其中有传统的缅甸拳击比赛、缅甸歌舞等。刘明辉代省长和谢富治将军等在这些彩棚里同成千的毛淡棉人民在一起欣赏了他们的杰出表演。
    泼水节期间，中国客人们还曾在14日到离开仰光五十英里的勃固县去参加瑞马道宝塔节。在这一天，缅甸总统吴温貌和几千勃固人民也来到这里朝拜祝贺。据说，瑞马道宝塔始建于二千三百年前，前后经过四次地震和倒塌，并经历代王朝扩建而成。到了1930年，又一次巨大的地震把整个佛塔毁坏了。缅甸独立后，1951年4月开始重修该塔，到1953年年底建成。现在，瑞马道宝塔是仅次于仰光大金塔的缅甸联邦的最大佛塔。中国客人们也在勃固参观了建于1881年的著名的卧佛。这个卧佛长达一百八十英尺，高达三十五英尺。据说，是世界上最大的卧佛。中国客人们还观看了缅甸的著名艺人演出的歌舞节目。其中一个叫做“团结就是胜利”，剧情是描写两个兄弟由于受到魔怪的挑拨而产生不和，后来明白了真象，团结一致，粉碎了外来的离间和破坏。吴努总理、刘明辉代省长和谢富治将军都非常赞赏这个歌舞剧的演出和情节。
    一年一度的缅甸泼水节过去了。中国的客人们现在已经离开仰光到上缅甸去进行访问。刘明辉代省长在离开仰光前发表的告别书中说道，在亲戚国家访问的这些日子并不是寻常的日子，而是充满了热烈情绪、具有深长意义的难忘的日子。他深信在和平共处五项原则的光辉照耀下，中缅两国的传统友谊必然会继续开放出灿烂的花朵。（附图片）
