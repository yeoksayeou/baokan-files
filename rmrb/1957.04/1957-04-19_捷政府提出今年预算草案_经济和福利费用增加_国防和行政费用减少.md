Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 18th. The Czechoslovak National Assembly held a plenary session on the 17th to discuss the draft national budget for 1957. Minister of Finance Ďuriš presented the budget report at the meeting.

According to Ďuriš's report, the total national revenue for 1957 will increase by 9.5% compared to last year, reaching 98.24 billion crowns (Czechoslovak currency); total expenditure will increase by 10.7% compared to last year, reaching 97.918 billion crowns. Compared to the budget draft passed by the Czechoslovak government meeting in March this year, both total revenue and total expenditure have increased.

This year, the proportion of expenditure on economy, culture, and social welfare in the total national expenditure is 86.9%, while it was 85.5% last year. Defense and public security expenditures accounted for 12.1% of the total budget expenditure in 1955, 10.7% last year, and have decreased to 9.5% this year. The proportion of administrative expenditures in total expenditure has also decreased from 4.1% in 1955 and 3.8% in 1956 to 3.6% this year.

Due to the vigorous decentralization of central power and the expansion of the powers of local government organs, the budget expenditure in the Slovak national region has increased by 27% compared to last year, and the budget expenditure of local government organs at all levels throughout the country has increased by 56.8% compared to last year.

Since special efforts will be made this year in coal production and the development of fuel bases, the funds allocated to the fuel and power industry in this year's budget have increased by 31.1% compared to last year, with more than half of them to be used for investment.

    捷政府提出今年预算草案
    经济和福利费用增加　国防和行政费用减少
    据新华社布拉格18日电　捷克斯洛伐克国民议会17日举行全体会议，讨论1957年国家预算草案。财政部长杜里什在会上作了预算报告。
    根据杜里什的报告，1957年国家总收入将比去年增加9.5％，共达九百八十二亿四千多万克朗（捷币名）；总支出将比去年增加10.7％，共达九百七十九亿一千八百多万克朗。同今年3月间捷克斯洛伐克政府会议通过的预算草案的数字相比较，总收入和总支出都增加了。
    今年用于经济、文化和社会福利方面的开支在国家总支出中所占的比重为86.9％，而去年是85.5％。国防和公安费用1955年在预算总支出中占12.1％，去年占10.7％，今年下降到9.5％。行政方面的开支在总支出中所占比重也由1955年的4.1％和1956年的3.8％，降低到今年的3.6％。
    由于大力进行分散中央权力和扩大地方政府机构权力，斯洛伐克民族地区的预算支出比去年增加了27％，全国各级地方政府机构的预算支出比去年增加了56.8％。
    由于今年要在煤的生产和燃料基地的发展方面作特殊的努力，今年预算中拨给燃料动力工业方面的款项比去年增加了31.1％，其中一半以上将用于投资。
