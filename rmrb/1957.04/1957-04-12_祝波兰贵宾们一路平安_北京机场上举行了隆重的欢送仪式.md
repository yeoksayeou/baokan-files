Xinhua News Agency, April 11th: The Polish People's Republic government delegation, headed by Chairman Cyrankiewicz, left Beijing this morning by special plane. The distinguished guests will visit Shanghai, Shenyang, and other places before visiting the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Mongolian People's Republic.

A grand send-off ceremony was held at the Beijing West Suburb Airport.

Premier Zhou Enlai delivered a farewell speech, saying:

    Dear Chairman Cyrankiewicz, dear comrades of the entire delegation, comrades and friends:
    The government delegation of the Polish People's Republic is about to leave us. In the past four days, we have spent pleasant moments together in Beijing and Tianjin.
    Chairman, you can see how much the Chinese people love the Polish people, how much they love the people of socialist countries, and how much they love the government delegation of the Polish People's Republic. I believe you will see the same situation in Shanghai and Shenyang.
    I would like to ask you to bring the Chinese people's friendship to the Polish people.
    In January of this year, when I visited Poland, we signed a joint statement between the Chinese and Polish governments in Warsaw. Today, we have signed a second joint statement. I believe that the signing of this joint statement between the two governments will further strengthen the friendly cooperation between the two countries, further strengthen the unity of socialist countries, and further encourage peace-loving countries and people around the world to work for the cause of defending world peace.
    You are about to depart, and your stay here has been too short. We express our regret at your departure.
    I wish the friendship between the two peoples continued development, wish the Polish People's Republic national prosperity and the people prosperity, wish Chairman Cyrankiewicz good health, wish all comrades of the delegation good health, and wish you a safe journey.

Chairman Cyrankiewicz then delivered a farewell speech, saying:

    Dear Premier Zhou Enlai, dear friends, dear Chinese comrades:
    It is with regret that we are about to leave Beijing. During these few days in Beijing, our delegation has received a warm reception from the Chinese leaders headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, and has seen their deep friendship for the Polish people. We had sincere and friendly talks with Chairman Mao Zedong, and held talks with Premier Zhou Enlai and other leaders of the Chinese government. The result of this is the joint statement signed today by Premier Zhou Enlai and myself.
    We will never forget the understanding of the Chinese comrades regarding the Polish issues and the friendship they have shown towards the Polish people. We will convey these to the Polish people.
    We believe that this visit will definitely help to strengthen the deep friendship that has already been established between the two countries, and further deepen the sympathy and friendship of the Polish people towards the Chinese people.
    We have not only had contact with the leaders of the Party and the state, but from Guangzhou to Beijing and Tianjin, we have seen hundreds of thousands of Chinese people who have expressed a warm welcome to us. We will never forget those Chinese youth who have expressed deep friendship and affection to us in various places. We express our gratitude for this. We hope to express our respect to the Chinese Party and government leaders, to the Chinese workers, peasants, and intellectuals. On behalf of the Polish government delegation, I sincerely salute the Chinese youth, who are the future of the people's China. We salute the Chinese women who are making increasingly important contributions to China's construction. I would like to summarize again and express our sincere respect to the entire Chinese people.
    We thank Comrade Zhou Enlai for the warm reception given to the delegation, and thank him for accompanying us to visit Tianjin; thank you all.
    Long live the great People's China!
    Long live the friendship between China and Poland!
    Long live the unity of the socialist family!
    Long live peace!

Those who came to the airport today to see them off included Vice Premiers of the State Council Chen Yun, He Long, Nie Rongzhen, and Bo Yibo; Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Li Jishen, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Peng Zhen, and Chen Shutong; Vice Chairmen of the National Defense Council Zhang Zhizhong and Fu Zuoyi; Vice Chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Zhang Bojun and Bao Erhan; Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei; as well as heads of various departments of state leading organs, democratic parties, and people's organizations, senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and people from all walks of life in Beijing.

The band played the national anthems of Poland and China. Chairman Cyrankiewicz, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai, reviewed the honor guard. Chairman Cyrankiewicz and others received flowers.

    祝波兰贵宾们一路平安
    北京机场上举行了隆重的欢送仪式
    新华社11日讯　以西伦凯维兹主席为首的波兰人民共和国政府代表团今天上午乘专机离开北京。贵宾们将在上海、沈阳等地参观访问后，去朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和蒙古人民共和国访问。
    在北京西郊机场上举行了隆重的欢送仪式。
    周恩来总理致欢送词说：
    亲爱的西伦凯维兹主席，亲爱的代表团的全体同志们，同志们和朋友们：
    波兰人民共和国政府代表团就要离开我们这里了。在过去四天中，在北京和天津，我们一起度过了愉快的时刻。
    主席同志，你可以看到中国人民是怎样地热爱波兰人民，热爱社会主义国家的人民，怎样地热爱波兰人民共和国政府代表团。我相信，在上海和沈阳，你们还会看到同样的情形。
    我愿意请求你把中国人民对波兰人民的友谊带给波兰人民。
    今年1月，我在波兰访问的时候，我们双方在华沙签订了中波两国政府的联合声明。今天我们又签订了第二次联合声明。我相信这次两国政府的联合声明的签订，将进一步加强两国的友好合作，进一步加强社会主义国家的团结，进一步争取全世界爱好和平的国家和人民为保卫世界和平事业而努力。
    你们就要动身了，你们留在这里的时间太短，我们表示惜别。
    祝两国人民的友谊继续发展，祝波兰人民共和国国家富强和人民繁荣，祝西伦凯维兹主席身体健康，祝代表团全体同志们身体健康，并祝你们一路平安。
    西伦凯维兹主席接着致告别词说：
    亲爱的周恩来总理，亲爱的朋友们，亲爱的中国同志们：
    很遗憾，我们就要离开北京了。在北京这几天中，我们代表团受到了以毛泽东同志为首的中国领导同志们的热情接待，看到了他们对波兰人民的深厚友谊。我们在诚挚、友好的空气中同毛泽东主席进行了交谈，同周恩来总理和中国政府的其他领导人员进行了会谈。其结果就是今天由周恩来总理和我所签订的联合声明。
    我们永远不会忘记中国同志对波兰问题的了解和他们所表现的对波兰人民的友谊。我们将把这些传达给波兰人民。
    我们相信，这次访问一定有助于加强两国已经建立起来的深厚友谊，更加加深波兰人民对中国人民的同情和友谊。
    我们不仅同党和国家的领导人进行了接触，而且从广州到北京、天津，我们看到了成千上万的中国人民，他们对我们都表示了热烈的欢迎，我们永远不会忘记那些在各地向我们表示了深厚友谊和感情的中国青年，我们对这些都表示感谢之意。我们希望对中国的党、政领导同志，对中国工人、农民、知识分子，表达我们的敬意。我代表波兰政府代表团衷心地向中国青年致敬，他们是人民中国的未来。我们向为中国建设事业作出日益重大贡献的中国妇女致敬。我想再概括地说一遍，我们向整个中国人民表示我们衷心的敬意。
    我们感谢周恩来同志给予代表团的热情接待，感谢他陪同我们到天津参观；感谢你们大家。
    伟大的人民中国万岁！
    中波友谊万岁！
    社会主义的大家庭团结万岁！
