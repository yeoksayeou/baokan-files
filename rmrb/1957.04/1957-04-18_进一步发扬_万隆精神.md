    Further Promote the "Bandung Spirit"
    Two years ago today, the Asian-African Conference, a great milestone in the awakening of the people of Asia and Africa, opened in Bandung, Indonesia. At this conference, the people of Asia and Africa solemnly and loudly declared to the world that Asia and Africa had entered a new era, and the era in which colonialists arbitrarily exploited and enslaved the people of Asia and Africa had passed. The people of Asia and Africa have emerged on the world stage as a new and powerful force.
    The unity of the people of Asian and African countries shown at the Asian-African Conference, and their common goals in opposing colonialism and developing economy and culture, greatly strengthened the courage and confidence of the people of Asian and African countries in fighting to safeguard world peace, oppose imperialism, and build their own countries. This has resulted in the rapid development of the situation in the Asian-African region over the past two years.
    In the past two years, Sudan, Morocco, Tunisia, and Ghana in Africa have successively gained independence. After independence, they all declared that they would adopt a policy of peace and neutrality. The independence of these countries will undoubtedly greatly promote the struggle of the African people for independence, thereby finally liberating Africa from the painful shackles of colonialism.
    The heroic struggle of the Egyptian people for the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company and the defeat of the Anglo-French-Israeli aggression is one of the most significant events in the Asian-African region in the past two years. This struggle tested the strength of the Asian and African people against colonialist aggression, and tested the unity of the Asian and African people in the face of the fierce attacks of colonialism. The people of Asian and African countries have successfully passed this test. With the firm support of the people of Asian and African countries and peace-loving people all over the world, the Egyptian people shattered the colonialists' offensive and safeguarded their sovereignty and independence. The struggle of the Egyptian people has made the people of Asian and African countries further see the face of the colonialists, strengthened their confidence in their own strength, and made them more determined to fight for and safeguard their independence and freedom.
    In the past two years, economic and cultural exchanges and cooperation between Asian and African countries based on the resolutions of the Asian-African Conference have also greatly developed. Many Asian and African countries have made significant achievements in building their own economies. In international affairs, Asian and African countries are also playing an increasingly important influence and role as independent political forces promoting world peace.
    The development of the situation in the Asian-African region over the past two years has proved the truth that as long as Asian and African countries unite according to the ten principles adopted by the Asian-African Conference, resolve the problems existing between them through consultation, and at the same time support and cooperate with each other to oppose the common enemy of colonialism, then any aggressive conspiracy of imperialism can be shattered, and the prosperity and development of Asian and African countries can be achieved.
    Of course, the achievements made by the people of Asian and African countries in safeguarding and striving for independence cannot but make the imperialists feel angry and panic. They are trying their best to undermine the unity between Asian and African countries, create antagonistic national groups in the Asian-African region, and carry out instigation, alienation and division in order to achieve the goal of divide and rule. They deliberately create tension in the Asian-African region, and even resort to armed aggression to suppress the struggle of the people of Asian and African countries for independence and freedom. The Anglo-French collusion with Israel's armed aggression against Egypt was a frantic struggle by the imperialists to maintain their colonial rule over the people of Asia and Africa.
    Now, although the Anglo-French armed aggression against Egypt has been shamefully defeated, the colonialists are not willing to lay down their butcher knives and give up. The world's most greedy, insidious, and brutal American colonialists are taking advantage of the weakening strength of the two old colonialists, Britain and France, to expand their aggressive forces into the Asian-African region, especially the Middle East and Africa. The Eisenhower Doctrine promoted by the United States in the Middle East, its "interest" in Africa, its continued occupation of China's territory of Taiwan, and its stubborn hostility towards the Chinese people, fully demonstrate the United States' aggressive ambitions towards the Asian-African region, and demonstrate its boundless hatred for the people of Asian and African countries who are determined to safeguard and strive for their own independence. At the same time, Britain and France are not reconciled to their failure and are trying to make a comeback. Therefore, although there are sharp contradictions between imperialists in the issue of competing for colonial interests, they are still consistent in suppressing and undermining the national independence and self-determination movements of the people of Asia and Africa.
    However, many events that have occurred in Asia and Africa have made the awareness of the people of Asian and African countries even higher. The imperialists' conspiracies and tricks have become difficult to deceive the discerning eyes of the people of Asia and Africa. The aggression and expansion of the United States in the Asian-African region will only arouse increasingly strong resistance from Asian-African nationalist forces.
    For two years, the "Bandung Spirit" has deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and has become a powerful inspiring force for the people of Asian and African countries in their struggle to maintain peace and oppose colonialism. In the past two years, the Chinese people have resolutely worked to safeguard world peace and oppose aggression in accordance with the resolutions and spirit of the Asian-African Conference, and have supported the struggle of the people of Asian and African countries against colonialism, and expanded and developed economic, cultural exchanges and cooperation with Asian and African countries. We are willing to take this opportunity of the second anniversary of the Asian-African Conference to encourage each other with the peace-loving and free-loving people of Asian and African countries, and work hard to further realize the goals of the Asian-African Conference, and let the "Bandung Spirit" flourish and grow!

### 进一步发扬“万隆精神”

    进一步发扬“万隆精神”
    两年以前的今天，成为亚非两洲人民觉醒的伟大里程碑的亚非会议，在印度尼西亚的万隆开幕。在这次会议上，亚非人民庄严而又响亮地向全世界宣告亚洲和非洲已经进入了新的纪元，殖民主义者任意剥削和奴役亚非人民的时代已经过去了。亚非两洲人民已经作为一支新生的强大力量出现在世界舞台上。
    亚非会议上所表现出来的亚非各国人民的团结，和他们在反对殖民主义、发展经济和文化等方面目标的一致，大大加强了亚非各国人民为维护世界和平、反对帝国主义、建设自己祖国而斗争的勇气和信心。这就使得亚非地区的形势两年来有了迅速的发展。
    在过去两年中，非洲的苏丹、摩洛哥、突尼斯和加纳先后取得了独立。它们在独立以后都宣布要采取和平中立的政策。这些国家的独立，无疑将大大推动非洲人民争取独立的斗争，从而使非洲最后从殖民主义的痛苦桎梏中解放出来。
    埃及人民为苏伊士运河公司国有化和击败英、法、以色列侵略而进行的英勇斗争，是过去两年中亚非地区最重大的事件之一。这场斗争考验了亚非人民反对殖民主义侵略的力量，考验了亚非人民在殖民主义凶恶进攻面前的团结。亚非各国人民已经胜利地通过了这个考验。在亚非各国人民和全世界爱好和平人民的坚决支持下，埃及人民粉碎了殖民主义者的进攻，维护了自己的主权和独立。埃及人民的斗争，使得亚非各国人民进一步看清楚了殖民主义者的面目，加强了对自己力量的信心，使得他们更加坚决地为争取和维护自己的独立、自由而斗争。
    在过去两年中，亚非各国之间根据亚非会议决议而进行的经济和文化方面的交流和合作，也有了很大的发展。许多亚非国家在建设本国经济方面取得了重大的成就。在国际事务中，亚非各国也正以作为促进世界和平的独立的政治力量，发挥着日益巨大的影响和作用。
    亚非地区两年来形势的发展，证明了这样一条真理：只要亚非各国根据亚非会议所通过的十项原则团结起来，通过协商解决相互之间存在的问题，同时互相支持、互相合作，来反对殖民主义这个共同的敌人，那末帝国主义的任何侵略阴谋都是可以粉碎的，亚非各国的繁荣和发展是可以获得的。
    当然，亚非各国人民在维护和争取独立方面所取得的成就，不能不使帝国主义者们感到愤怒和惊慌。它们竭力企图破坏亚非各国之间的团结，在亚非地区制造对立性的国家集团，进行挑拨离间和分化，以便达到分而治之的目的。它们故意在亚非地区制造紧张局势，甚至不惜采取武装侵略的手段，来镇压亚非各国人民争取独立自由的斗争。英、法勾结以色列对埃及的武装侵略，就是帝国主义者为了保持对亚非人民殖民统治而进行的一次疯狂挣扎。
    现在，英、法对埃及的武装侵略虽然已经可耻地失败了，可是殖民主义者们并不肯放下屠刀，就此罢休。世界上最贪婪、最阴险、最残暴的美国殖民主义者，正在乘着英、法这两个老牌殖民主义者力量削弱的机会，向亚非地区，特别是中东和非洲，扩张它的侵略势力。美国在中东推行的艾森豪威尔主义，它对非洲所表现的“兴趣”，它对中国领土台湾的继续侵占和对中国人民所抱的顽固的敌视态度，都充分表明了美国对亚非地区的侵略野心，表明了它对决心维护和争取自己独立的亚非各国人民的无限仇恨。同时，英、法也不甘心于自己的失败，而企图卷土重来。因此，虽然帝国主义之间在争夺殖民利益的问题上有着尖锐的矛盾，但是在镇压和破坏亚非人民的民族独立和自决运动方面，它们还是一致的。
    然而，在亚非两洲所发生的许多事件，已经使亚非各国人民的觉悟更加提高了。帝国主义者们的阴谋诡计，已经很难瞒过亚非人民的雪亮的眼睛了。美国对亚非地区的侵略和扩张，只会引起亚非民族主义力量日益强烈的反抗。
    两年以来，“万隆精神”已经深入人心，成为亚非各国人民在维护和平、反对殖民主义的斗争中的一个强大的鼓舞力量。中国人民在过去两年中，根据亚非会议的决议和精神，曾经坚决地为维护世界和平、反对侵略而努力，并且支持亚非各国人民反对殖民主义的斗争，扩大和发展同亚非各国的经济和文化上的交流和合作。我们愿意乘此亚非会议两周年的机会，同爱好和平和自由的亚非各国人民共勉，为进一步实现亚非会议的目标而努力，让“万隆精神”更加繁荣滋长！
