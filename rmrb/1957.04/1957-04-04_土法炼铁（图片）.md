    Backyard Steelmaking
    Shangcheng County, Henan Province, is located on the northern foot of the Dabie Mountains, with the Guan River running through it, and is rich in iron sand. Panning iron sand is the main sideline occupation of local farmers. They set up sand iron factories in the mountain valleys, using local materials and keeping costs low. The quality of the iron they smelt is also good, making it a good material for agricultural tools. The county's sand iron factories can produce more than 2,300 tons of pig iron for the country every year.

    土法炼铁
    河南省商城县位于大别山的北麓，灌河横贯其中，蕴藏着丰富的铁砂。淘铁砂是当地农民的主要副业，他们把砂铁厂设在山窝里，就地取材，成本低廉，炼出来的铁质量也不错，是作农具的好材料，全县的砂铁厂每年可为国家生产生铁二千三百多吨。
