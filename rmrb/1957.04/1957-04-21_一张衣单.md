    A List of Clothing
    Liu Baifeng

    It's already the time of year to change seasons. What clothes does Li Shuyu need to buy this year? She already had a plan in mind. She planned to make a two-way shirt, a loose outer coat, a shirt, a pair of blue trousers, and three pairs of underpants for summer, and a cotton-padded coat for winter, requiring about fifty feet of cotton cloth in total.

    However, the country is currently calling on everyone to save cotton cloth, and Li Shuyu cannot remain indifferent, especially since she is a cadre in the Propaganda Department of the Qianmen District Committee of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and needs to carry out publicity work in this regard to the general public.

    On the afternoon of April 14, I went to Li Shuyu's home. In order to find ways to save cotton cloth, Li Shuyu made a list of the clothes she thought she could still wear.

    Made last year: two shirts, three pairs of trousers, a blue jacket, a lined jacket, a skirt, two pairs of underpants, and also fourteen feet of cloth in storage.

    From before last year: two pairs of trousers, a shirt, a short overcoat, a set of flannel clothes.

    Most of the clothes made last year are still fairly new, and the clothes made before last year are also complete and undamaged.

    After Li Shuyu finished making the clothing list, a look of contemplation appeared on her face, and her eyes moved back and forth on the list, as if trying to find something on it. After a moment, a few smiles appeared on Li Shuyu's face, and she said to me while picking up her pen and drawing lines on the clothing list: "These few pieces can be completely saved." I took the clothing list and saw that she had crossed out the loose outer coat, the pair of blue trousers, and the shirt that she had planned to make this year.

    Originally, for a young female comrade, making a few new clothes a year cannot be considered excessive. However, from the perspective of promoting thrift, Li Shuyu's already greatly compressed purchase plan is not without potential for further reduction. Take the fourteen feet of cloth she bought in June of last year, for example, she hasn't found a suitable use for it yet!

    As the saying goes, "Accounts must be clearly calculated." Li Shuyu rummaged through the bottom of her trunk and saved twenty-three feet of cotton cloth. If each of us rummages through the bottom of our trunks, makes a clothing list like Li Shuyu, and calculates carefully, how much cotton cloth can we save for the country in a year? I think the number is very considerable.

    一张衣单
    刘柏枫
    已经是换季的时候了，今年需要添置一些什么衣服？李书钰心里早就有了打算。她计划今年夏天做一件两用衫、一件大褂、一件衬衣、一条蓝长裤、三条裤叉，冬天做一件棉衣，大约共需用棉布五十尺。
    但是，目前国家正在号召大家节约使用棉布，李书钰不能无动于中，何况她还是中共北京市前门区委会宣传部的干部，要向广大群众作这方面的宣传工作呢？
    4月14日下午，我到李书钰家里去。李书钰为了找寻节约棉布的门道，把自己认为还可以穿的衣服开了一张清单。
    去年做的有：二件衬衣、三条长裤、一件蓝上衣、一件夹衣、一条裙子、二条裤叉，另外还存有十四尺衣料。
    去年以前的还有：二条长裤、一件衬衣、一件短大衣、一套绒衣服。
    去年做的衣服，绝大部分还是半新的，去年以前做的衣服，也都是完整无损的。
    李书钰开完衣单以后，脸上现出了沉思的神色，两只眼睛在衣单上转来转去，好像要从这上面发现什么似的。片刻，李书钰的脸上露出了几丝微笑，她一边拿起钢笔在衣单上画道道，一边对我说：“这几件完全可以节约下来。”我接过衣单一看，她把今年计划要做的一件大褂、一条蓝长裤、一件衬衣画掉了。
    本来，对一个年青的女同志来说，一年做几件新衣服，不能算是多余的。但是，从提倡节约的角度来看，李书钰这个已经大大压缩了的添置计划，也并非再无潜力可挖，就拿去年6月间买的那十四尺衣料来说吧，到现在她还没有找到合适的用途哩！
    俗语说：“账不算不清。”李书钰把自己的箱底子翻了一下，就节约了二十三尺棉布，如果我们每个人都翻翻箱底子，像李书钰一样开一张衣单，算算细账，今年一年可以给国家节约多少棉布呢？我想，这个数字是非常可观的。
