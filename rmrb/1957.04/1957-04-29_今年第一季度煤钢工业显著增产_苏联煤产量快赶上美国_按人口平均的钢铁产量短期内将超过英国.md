Xinhua News Agency dispatches: According to Xinhua News Agency reports: The output of the Soviet coal and steel industries in the first quarter of this year has significantly increased compared to the same period last year.

According to preliminary estimates, the Soviet Union's coal production in the first quarter of this year has greatly approached the production level of the United States, which has the highest coal production in the world. In the first three months of this year, the Soviet Union mined a total of over 100 million tons of coal, while the estimated coal production in the United States during the same period was not much higher than this. The coal production in the United States has been declining for many years. Taking the level of 1947 to 1949 as 100, the average index of coal production in the United States in the first quarter of last year was only 87%, with a total production of over 120 million tons of coal. In the first three months of this year, the production level further declined compared to the same period last year, with the production index in January only reaching about 80%. The Soviet Union's coal production in the first quarter of this year increased by nearly 10 million tons compared to the same period last year, which is a significant increase. It is almost equal to the total increase in coal production in Britain and France during the five years from 1951 to 1955.

The Soviet steel industry produced over 2 million tons more metal in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period last year. The industry produced a total of approximately 9 million tons of pig iron, 8.9 million tons of steel, and 10.5 million tons of rolled steel.

The increase in steel production is mainly due to the continuous adoption of new production technologies and equipment in production.

The British steel industry delegation that visited the Soviet Union last summer recently expressed surprise in a report at the speed of development of the Soviet metallurgical industry. Its report pointed out that if the Soviet metallurgical industry continues to develop at its current speed (which, in their opinion, is entirely possible), then the Soviet Union's per capita production of steel and pig iron will catch up with Britain in a "very short time" and will "significantly approach the level of the United States." As everyone knows, in terms of the absolute output of steel and iron, the Soviet Union has long surpassed the total steel production of Britain and France and firmly holds the second position in the world.

    今年第一季度煤钢工业显著增产
    苏联煤产量快赶上美国
    按人口平均的钢铁产量短期内将超过英国
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：苏联煤和钢铁工业的产量，今年第一季度比去年同期有了显著的增加。
    据初步估计，今年第一季度，苏联的煤产量已经大大接近世界煤产量最高的美国的煤矿生产水平。在今年头三个月中，苏联总共开采了一亿吨以上的煤，而美国同一时期煤产量据估计比这多不了多少。美国的煤产量多年来一直有下降趋势。如以1947年到1949年的水平为一百，去年第一季度美国的煤产量平均指标只达87％，总共生产了一亿二千多万吨煤，而在今年头三个月，生产水平又比去年同时期下降了不少，一月份的生产指标只达80％左右。苏联今年第一季度的煤产量比去年同期增加了近一千万吨，这是一个很大的增加。它差不多等于1951—1955年五年间英国和法国煤产量增加额的总和。
    苏联钢铁工业今年头一季度比去年同期增产了二百多万吨金属。这个工业总共生产了约九百万吨生铁，八百九十万吨钢和一千零五十万吨轧钢。
    钢铁工业的增产主要是由于在生产中不断采用新的生产技术和装备的结果。
    去年夏天访问过苏联的英国炼钢工业代表团，最近在一份报告中对苏联冶金工业发展的速度表示惊讶。它的报告指出，如果苏联的冶金工业以目前速度发展下去（照他们看来，这是完全可能的），那么，苏联按人口平均计算的钢和生铁产量，将在“很短的时间内”赶上英国，而且“将显著地接近美国的水平”。大家知道，就钢和铁的绝对产量来说，苏联早就已经超过英国和法国钢铁产量的总和，而稳居世界第二位。
