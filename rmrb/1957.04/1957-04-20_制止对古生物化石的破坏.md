Stop the Destruction of Paleontological Fossils
    *People's Daily* Commentator

    Our country's underground contains extremely rich paleontological fossils. They are ancient organisms (tens of thousands or even hundreds of millions of years ago) buried underground, isolated from the air, and gradually formed over a long period. Paleontological fossils are important data for scientific research, and the Party and the state have always attached great importance to their protection. The Government Administration Council stipulated the protection of paleontological fossils in its policies and laws for the protection of cultural relics. In early April 1956, the State Council issued a notice on the protection of cultural relics, specifically pointing out that paleontological fossils are very important scientific research data and should be resolutely protected. In September of the same year, the joint notice of the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives also stipulated:
  “Supply and marketing cooperatives in all 'dragon bone' producing areas should not encourage farmers to dig for 'dragon bones' in the future. The 'dragon bones' collected should be kept intact in their original form and should not be broken, so as not to damage their academic research value.”
    However, at present, due to the insufficient strength of the national cultural relics protection force and the inadequate publicity work on cultural relics protection, the phenomenon of destroying paleontological fossils is still extremely serious in various places. In many areas, paleontological fossils discovered during basic construction are often arbitrarily destroyed. Farmers in Guangxi, Guizhou, Yunnan and other places often dig "rock mud" from limestone caves as fertilizer, causing serious damage to paleontological fossils preserved in this rock mud. We should especially point out that a portion of paleontological fossils, mainly fossils of mammals from the late Tertiary and early Quaternary periods (approximately 15 million to 1 million years ago) (commonly known as "dragon bones"), have suffered the greatest damage. Under the large-scale acquisition by the China Medicinal Materials Company, large-scale mining of "dragon bones" has emerged in various places. Many farmers have even abandoned agricultural production to engage in excavation work full-time. Therefore, in the past few years, the damage to paleontological fossils, calculated only from existing materials, has reached tens of millions of catties.
    The seriousness of this situation can also be seen from the following examples. In 1955 and 1956, the China Medicinal Materials Company purchased hundreds of thousands of catties of "dragon bones" in Shanxi, 30,000 catties in Wanxian, Sichuan in 1956, 80,000 catties in Qin'an County, Gansu from May to October 1956, and planned to purchase 150,000 catties in the Yandian District of Dalat Banner, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in 1957. In recent months, purchasing stations have also been established in Caocun and Fuliji in northern Anhui. In 1956, Changyang, Hubei, "produced" more than 10,000 catties of "dragon bones," during which a complete human skull fossil belonging to the Chinese ape-man type was destroyed, and only a small piece was preserved. Dozens of caves rich in fossils within the territory of Bijie Prefecture, Guizhou, have been almost completely excavated. Laiyang Jingangkou and other places in Shandong Province, which are internationally renowned Cretaceous (approximately 70 million years ago) dinosaur fossil producing areas in our country, have also been severely damaged. In addition, similar situations exist in Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Shaanxi, Henan, Jilin, and Heilongjiang.
    Arbitrary excavation and destruction of paleontological fossils will cause irreparable losses to our country's cultural construction and scientific undertakings.
    Paleontological fossils are records of the development history of life on Earth. We know that the biological world is not an accumulation of individual organisms, but a complex biological system with a long history. It is a complex biological system in which there are interconnections between the organisms themselves and between the organisms and their surrounding environment. As a result of the continuous development of the organic world, each period is inhabited by unique organisms. In the development process of organisms and the biological world, some organisms died, while others changed their morphology and continued to survive through their descendants. Based on paleontological fossil materials, we can determine the different periods in biological history and clarify the connection and inheritance between modern organisms and extinct organisms. Therefore, destroying paleontological fossils is equivalent to eliminating the evidence of biological development.
    Paleontological fossils can also help geologists study and identify the age of strata and understand the climate and sea-land distribution at that time. We know that paleontological specimens in strata, just like archaeological materials in burial grounds, help determine the age of strata. Using fossils as records in strata can help find the mineral deposits needed by the country. For example, the mammoths and rhinoceros and other animals found in fossils in Jilin Province all lived in the Quaternary period. Based on these fossils, the age and sequence of the strata can also be determined. At the same time, we know that different kinds of organisms live in different geographical and climatic environments. Studying the fossils found in strata can help understand the geographical and climatic conditions under which these strata were formed. This knowledge is of great significance for understanding general geological conditions and the formation and distribution of certain minerals. Therefore, destroying paleontological fossils is equivalent to eliminating important data for geology, paleogeography, and paleoclimatology.
    Our country is one of the few countries in the world with rich paleontological fossils. However, if this situation of arbitrary excavation and destruction is allowed to continue, it will be difficult to find paleontological fossils in our country in three to five years. Taking the current situation as an example, it was previously believed that certain areas in Guizhou and Guangxi had particularly rich paleontological fossils, but now the reserves in these areas are very small. This is really worthy of deep vigilance!
    Not only that, but arbitrary excavation and destruction of paleontological fossils is also unfavorable to the farmers themselves. Many farmers do not concentrate on agricultural production because excavating "dragon bones" is profitable. This not only seriously affects agricultural production, but also greatly hinders the consolidation and improvement of agricultural cooperatives. At the same time, during the excavation process, landslides often occur, causing personal injury and death.
    Based on the above situation and opinions, we hope that the competent authorities will quickly take effective measures to change the current serious situation. We must further publicize the Party and state policies, publicize knowledge about paleontological fossils, widely mobilize the masses, and do a good job in protection. Cultural departments and state pharmaceutical departments should also jointly consult and formulate specific methods to protect scientific materials on the one hand and meet medical needs on the other.

    制止对古生物化石的破坏
    本报评论员
    我国地下蕴藏着极其丰富的古生物化石。它们是古代各种生物（距今几万年甚至几亿年）被埋在地下，同地面空气隔绝，经过漫长的岁月才逐渐形成的。古生物化石是科学研究上的重要资料，党和国家一向十分重视对它们的保护。政务院在保护文物政策法令中，就曾规定了保护古生物化石。1956年4月上旬，国务院又发出了保护文物的通知，特别提出古生物化石是很重要的科学研究资料，应该坚决保护。同年9月，中华人民共和国文化部、中华全国供销合作总社联合通知中也规定：
  “各龙骨产地的供销合作社，今后不得鼓励农民挖掘龙骨。收进的龙骨，应保持原有的完整，不要打碎，以免破坏学术研究价值。”
    但是，目前由于国家文物保护力量还很不足，保护文物宣传工作也还作得不够，各地破坏古生物化石的现象仍极严重。许多地区在基本建设中，往往把发现的古生物化石任意毁坏。广西、贵州和云南等地的农民，还常挖掘石灰岩山洞中的“岩泥”作肥料，致使保存在这种岩泥中的古生物化石遭受严重损失。我们应该特别指出的是古生物化石中有一部分，主要的是第三纪后期和第四纪初期（距今约一千五百万年至一百万年）的哺乳动物的化石（俗名“龙骨”）遭到的破坏最大。在中国药材公司大量收购下，各地出现了大规模的开采龙骨的现象。不少农民竟离开了农业生产，全力从事挖掘工作。因此，几年以来，古生物化石的遭到破坏，仅以已有材料计算，就达数千万斤之多。
    这种情况的严重性，还可从下面一些事例中看出。中国药材公司1955年和1956年在山西收购了龙骨数十万斤，1956年在四川万县收购了三万斤，1956年5至10月份在甘肃秦安县收购了八万斤，1957年计划在内蒙古自治区达拉特旗盐店区收购十五万斤，最近几个月内还在皖北曹村和符离集分别设立收购站。湖北长阳1956年“出产”了一万多斤龙骨，其中有一完整的属于中国猿人类型的人类头骨化石被破坏了，只有一小块保存下来。贵州毕节专区境内含化石丰富的数十个洞穴几乎已被全部挖空。山东省莱阳金刚口等地是我国在国际上著名的白垩纪（距今约七千万年）恐龙化石产地，也已受到严重破坏。此外，在广东、广西、云南、陕西、河南、吉林和黑龙江等地，也有类似情况。
    任意挖掘和破坏古生物化石，会给我国文化建设和科学事业造成不可弥补的损失。
    古生物化石是地球上生物的发展历史的记录。我们知道，生物界不是个别生物的累积，而是具有漫长历史的。它是在其本身之间以及生物同周围环境之间相互有联系的一个复杂的生物系统。由于有机界不断发展的结果，每一时期都生活着特有的有机体。在有机体和生物界的发展过程中，一些有机体死亡了，而另一些有机体就改变了自己的形态，并且通过后代继续生存下去。根据古生物化石的材料，我们可以确定生物史上各个不同的时期，可以阐明现代生物同已灭种生物之间的联系和继承性。因此，破坏了古生物化石，也就等于消灭了生物发展的证据。
    古生物化石还可以帮助地质学家研究和鉴定地层的年代，并且了解当时的气候和海陆分布等方面的情形。我们知道，古生物标本在地层中，正如考古材料在墓葬地里一样，都有助于地层年代的确定。以化石作为地层中的记录，就可以找到国家所需要的矿藏。例如，吉林省发现的化石中的猛犸和犀牛等动物，都是生存在第四纪的。根据这些化石，地层的年代和顺序也就可以确定了。同时，我们知道，在不同的地理和气候的环境中，生活着不同种类的生物。研究地层里所发现的化石，可以了解形成这些地层的地理和气候的情形。这些知识对于了解一般地质情况，以及了解某些矿物的生成和分布的情况，都有很大意义。因此，破坏了古生物化石，也就等于消灭了地质学、古地理学和古气候学的重要资料。
    我国是世界上少数蕴有丰富的古生物化石的国家之一。但是，目前这种任意挖掘和破坏的情况如果任其继续下去，那末三、五年后，在我国也将很难找到古生物化石了。就拿目前的情况看，过去认为贵州和广西某些地区蕴有特别丰富的古生物化石，但是现在这些地区的蕴藏量就已很小。这实在是值得深刻警惕的！
    不但这样，任意挖掘和破坏古生物化石，对于农民本身也是不利的。不少农民由于挖掘龙骨有利可图，就不安心农业生产。这就不仅严重地影响了农业生产，而且大大地妨碍了农业社的巩固和提高。同时，在挖掘过程中，还常引起山石崩倒，发生人身伤亡事故。
    根据上述情况和意见，我们希望主管部门迅速采取有效措施，改变目前这种严重情况。我们要进一步地宣传党和国家的政策，宣传关于古生物化石的知识，广泛发动群众，做好保护工作。文化部门和国药部门更要共同协商，订出一个具体办法，以求在一方面能够保护科学材料，另一方面又能满足医药的需要。
