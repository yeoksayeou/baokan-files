Lake and Mountain Spring Rain Welcomes Distinguished Guests
—Polish Government Delegation at the Summer Palace
Yesterday, Beijing had its first spring rain. Chairman Cyrankiewicz and the distinguished guests of the Polish government delegation, accompanied by Vice Premier He Long, visited the Summer Palace.

The Summer Palace had already shed its winter attire. Peach blossoms were in full bloom, and willows were sprouting green. Everywhere one looked, amidst the verdant pines and cypresses, there were splashes of crimson and tender green. Ripples swayed on Kunming Lake. Although the sky had not cleared for a long time, the spring atmosphere was still strong, inspiring people's interest in sightseeing.

The distinguished guests arrived at the Summer Palace by car at 10:15 AM. At that moment, spring thunder rumbled, mingling with the applause of the tourists who lined the streets to welcome them. The distinguished guests first visited the Hall of Benevolence and Longevity. They were very interested in the cultural relics, silk embroidery, and ancient tripods displayed in the hall, and inquired about the age of these exhibits one by one. After leaving the Hall of Benevolence and Longevity, the guests arrived at the Grand Theater in the Garden of Virtue and Harmony. Chairman Cyrankiewicz and others ascended the newly painted stage and were warmly welcomed by hundreds of primary school students who were spending their spring break there. Then, the distinguished guests strolled through the Long Corridor, admiring the scenery on both sides.

At 10:45 AM, the guests arrived at the Hall of Dispelling Clouds. Chairman Cyrankiewicz and his wife paused for a moment in front of Empress Dowager Cixi's embroidered portrait. Vice Premier He Long introduced them to Cixi's attire and her character. After leaving the Hall of Dispelling Clouds, the distinguished guests ascended the central point of Longevity Hill, the Tower of Buddhist Incense, step by step. They sat down for a short rest on the cloister in front of the Tower of Buddhist Incense, watching the lake and mountain scenery before them. At this time, the rain became heavier. The distant Western Hills and the islands in the lake were shrouded in a misty rain, creating a particularly moving scene. Vice Premier He introduced the surrounding scenery to the guests. A group of primary school students who were touring the park nearby sent their representative, Wang Fengying, to present a red scarf to Chairman Cyrankiewicz. After she tied the red scarf around the distinguished guest's neck, Chairman Cyrankiewicz shook hands with her cordially.

After a short rest, the distinguished guests left the Tower of Buddhist Incense and went to the Hall for Listening to Orioles for lunch. After the meal, the rain had stopped, and the sky showed a hint of clearing. The distinguished guests originally planned to go to the back mountain to see the peach blossoms, but they had to give up due to time constraints. On the way back, Chairman Cyrankiewicz spoke to reporters about his impressions after the visit. He greatly admired the beautiful scenery and the carved beams and painted pillars here. He said that if he had the opportunity in the future, he would like to come to such a beautiful place for a vacation. Vice Premier He Long welcomed him to come again. Chairman Cyrankiewicz regretted that he had been too busy with government affairs last year and had not taken a vacation, and he did not know what this year would be like.

At 1:15 PM, Chairman Cyrankiewicz and the Polish government delegation left amidst the warm applause of the tourists.

    湖山春雨迎贵宾
    ——波兰政府代表团在颐和园
    昨天北京下了第一场春雨。西伦凯维兹主席和波兰政府代表团贵宾们，在贺龙副总理的陪同下游览了颐和园。
    颐和园已经卸去了冬装。园内桃花盛开，杨柳吐青。放眼看去，在苍松翠柏之间，嫣红嫩绿处处可见。昆明湖里涟漪荡漾。虽然天空久未放晴，但仍是春意盎然，激发人们的游兴。
    贵宾们在上午十时一刻驱车来到了颐和园。这时春雷阵阵，和夹道欢迎的游人们的掌声响成一片。贵宾们首先参观了仁寿殿。他们对殿内陈列着的文物、丝绣和古鼎等物极有兴趣，一一询问了这些陈列物的年代。出仁寿殿后，客人们来到了德和园里的戏楼。西伦凯维兹主席等登上了油漆一新的戏台，受到了正在这里度春假的数百个小学生的热烈欢迎。接着，贵宾们漫步穿过长廊，浏览了两旁的景色。
    十时三刻，客人来到了排云殿。西伦凯维兹主席和他的夫人在慈禧太后的绣像面前停留片刻，贺龙副总理向他们介绍了慈禧的服饰和她的为人。出排云殿后，贵宾们一一拾级登上了万寿山的中心点佛香阁。在佛香阁前的回廊上，他们就座稍息，观看了眼前的湖光山色。这时雨下得大了。远处的西山和湖中的岛屿都笼罩在一片烟雨之中，别具一番动人的姿态。贺副总理向客人们介绍了周围的景物。正在近旁游园的一群小学生推派了他们的代表王凤英前来向西伦凯维兹主席献红领巾。她把红领巾围上贵宾的颈领后，西伦凯维兹主席同她亲切地握了手。
    稍事休息后，贵宾们下佛香阁前往听鹂馆进餐。餐后，雨已停止，天空微露霁色。贵宾们原拟再去后山观赏桃花，但因限于时间只能作罢。在归途中，西伦凯维兹主席向记者们谈到了游园以后的印象。他对这里的美丽景色和雕梁画栋甚为欣赏，他说以后如果有机会，愿意到这样美好的地方来休假。贺龙副总理表示欢迎他再来。西伦凯维兹主席惋惜地说，去年他因为政务繁忙，没有休假，不知今年如何。
    一时一刻，西伦凯维兹主席和波兰政府代表团在游人们的热烈掌声中离去。
