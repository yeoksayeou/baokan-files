Xinhua News Agency, London, 9th Dispatch: Some British newspapers today demanded the relaxation of trade restrictions on China, and expressed dissatisfaction with the government's subservient attitude to the United States on this issue.

    The "Daily Express" criticized the British government for "still waiting for American permission" on the issue of trade with China, and said: "We hope America will say yes. But whether they agree or not, now is the time for the British government to recognize that British affairs are British affairs."
    The "News Chronicle" criticized the current embargo list against China as "utterly absurd" and that "maintaining different embargo lists for China and the Soviet Union is ridiculous."
    In the House of Commons debate on April 8, many members of parliament raised questions regarding the embargo issue.
    Labour MP Younger emphasized that the government has repeatedly stated that it is discussing the issue of trade with China, but has not yet taken any practical measures. Labour MPs Rankin and Shinwell demanded that the government make its attitude on trade with China clearer, emphasizing that the current restrictions hinder the development of British exports at a time when Britain urgently needs to expand exports. Shinwell also asked whether Britain's trade policy towards China is still dictated by the United States.
    Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Ormsby-Gore, in answering these questions, only said that during the Bermuda conference, the British delegation presented to the American delegation its views on the need to reduce trade restrictions on China. Now, the British government is awaiting the American response.
    Conservative MP Lord Hinchingbrooke questioned: "Does this mean that if the United States gives a negative answer, the British government will continue to consider taking unilateral action on trade with China?"
    Ormsby-Gore said that he could only guarantee further discussion of the issue after receiving the American reply.

    不满意政府屈从美国的态度
    英报纸和议员要求放宽对华“禁运”
    新华社9日讯　伦敦消息：英国一些报纸今天要求放宽对中国的贸易限制，并且不满意政府在这个问题上屈从美国的态度。
    “每日快报”抨击英国政府在对华贸易问题上“仍然在等待美国的许可”，它说：“我们希望美国说可以。但是不管他们是否同意，现在是英国政府认识到英国的事情就是英国的事情的时候了。”
    “新闻纪事报”批评目前对中国的禁运单是“绝顶荒唐的”，“对中国和对苏联维持不同的禁运单是可笑的”。
    在4月8日的下院辩论中，许多议员，就禁运问题提出了质询。
    工党议员杨格着重指出，政府屡次声明，它在讨论对华贸易问题，然而至今仍未采取任何实际措施。工党议员兰金和辛威尔要求政府在对华贸易问题上更清楚地表明态度，他们强调指出，目前的限制在英国迫切需要扩大出口的时刻妨碍着英国出口的发展。辛威尔还问英国的对华贸易政策是不是仍然在听命于美国。
    协办外交事务国务大臣欧姆斯比—戈尔在回答这些问题的时候只是说，百慕大会议期间，英国代表团向美国代表团陈述了它认为必须减少对华贸易限制问题上的见解。现在，英国政府正在期待美国的答复。
    保守党议员欣琴布鲁克勋爵质问道：“这是不是说，如果美国给予否定答复，英国政府要继续审议对华贸易问题以采取单方面行动？”
    欧姆斯比—戈尔说，他只可以保证在接到美国答复以后进一步讨论这个问题。
