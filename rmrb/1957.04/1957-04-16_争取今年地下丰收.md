    Strive for a Bumper Harvest Underground This Year
    Exploration personnel in the Qaidam Basin are all planning to strive for an "underground bumper harvest" in the final year of the First Five-Year Plan this year, with less investment and more tasks.
    Now, snowflakes are still fluttering here, but the exploration personnel have set off for the field sites one to one and a half months earlier than last year. Some field personnel gathered in Da Qaidan these days are collecting data, looking for reference books, exchanging geological information, or exchanging exploration experience. The Qinghai Petroleum Prospecting Brigade of the Ministry of Geology will provide the state this year with a more accurate assessment of the oil-bearing prospects of the Qaidam Basin and preliminary planning opinions for comprehensive development with petroleum as the main focus. The geological teams and drilling teams they have formed have also set off one after another. The geological drilling teams that have arrived at the structures of Lenghu No. 3 and Lenghu No. 7 have already started the rumbling of the installed drilling rigs. (Attached picture)

    争取今年地下丰收
    柴达木盆地的勘探人员，今年都打算在投资少、任务大的情况下，为第一个五年计划的最后一年争取一个“地下丰收”。
    现在，这里仍然飘着雪花，但是勘探人员却比去年提前一个月到一个半月向野外工地出发了。聚集在大柴旦的一些野外人员近日正搜集资料、找参考书、交换地质情况，或者交流勘探经验。地质部青海石油普查大队今年将给国家提出较确切的柴达木含油远景评价和以石油为主的综合开发初步规划意见，他们组成的地质队，钻井队也陆续出发。已到达冷湖三号、冷湖七号构造上的地质钻井队，安装起的钻机已发出隆隆的响声。（附图片）
    这是柴达木冷湖四号构造上钻井的一部分。
