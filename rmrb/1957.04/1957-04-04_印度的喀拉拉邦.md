India's Kerala State

The Communist Party of India, which won a majority of seats in the Kerala State Assembly elections, is about to form a new state government. Kerala has become the first administrative region in India led by communists.

Kerala is located in the southwestern part of the Indian peninsula. It is a newly established state after India adjusted its administrative regions last November, with a total area of 15,035 miles, the smallest of the 14 states in India. The state has a total population of 13.56 million, with the highest population density among Indian states. The residents are Malayalis, mainly speaking Malayalam. 60% of the residents are Hindus, 25% are Christians, and the rest are Muslims. The capital is Thiruvananthapuram.

Kerala is composed of most of the original Travancore-Cochin state plus a small part of the adjacent Madras state. Kerala is the name of an ancient South Indian dynasty with a long history. The Travancore state established a parliament in 1888.

British colonial forces invaded Travancore early on. In 1684, British capital established a factory in Anjengo in the state, plundering its abundant resources and cheap labor. In 1795, the British East India Company signed a formal treaty with Travancore, turning the state into a British protectorate. From 1805, the state had to pay 800,000 rupees in tribute to Britain every year. Due to the colonialist policy of divide and rule, it was not until 1923 that Travancore had direct relations with the Indian government. Now, British capital still dominates the main economic sectors in Kerala.

Located in the tropics and coastal areas, Kerala has abundant natural resources. Its main product is coconut, and it also abounds in tea, coffee, pepper, betel nut, rubber, and produces a variety of items such as sugar cane, arrowroot, cardamom, sesame, peanuts, ginger, lemongrass, and turmeric. Rice is the main food crop. The vast coastal sandbars also contain many minerals of important economic value, mainly iron, titanium, bauxite, cobaltite, garnet, etc. Vast areas have white clay, which is the raw material for the pottery industry. There are also vast and lush forests, rich in timber, charcoal, bamboo and other forest products.

Industry has also developed considerably in this state. According to the 1954-1955 Indian Yearbook, the original Travancore-Cochin state had 992 registered factories, employing more than 111,000 workers. The main factories include cotton mills, power plants, and porcelain factories. Rural handicrafts and plantations are well-developed. The largest coconut coir industry regularly employs 500,000 to 600,000 workers. Kerala's water and land transportation are convenient, and the transportation industry has been nationalized. There is a 100-mile-long railway from east to west along the coast to the capital Thiruvananthapuram.

Among the Indian states, Kerala has a relatively developed culture and education, with the highest proportion of literate people, about 60%-70%. According to the 1954-1955 Indian Yearbook, the original Travancore-Cochin state had 4,086 primary schools, 1,265 middle schools, 160 special schools, and 39 colleges, including five women's colleges. Some areas of this state have implemented free primary compulsory education. The emphasis on local languages ​​is a feature of education in Kerala. From primary school, the local language (Malayalam) is a compulsory subject, and from junior high school, Hindi is also a compulsory subject. English is the main foreign language in schools, but is only an important course in universities.

For a long time, the people of Kerala have launched widespread anti-imperialist and anti-feudal mass movements. Large-scale peasant movements broke out in the Malabar region in 1921 and between 1930 and 1932. Since 1937, peasant associations have been established in various districts of Malabar to fight for rent reduction. Since being led by the Communist Party of India, the peasant movement in Kerala has developed further. In the 1946 election, the Communists put forward the slogan of establishing a unified Kerala in India, which was supported and endorsed by the broad masses of the people. In 1947, the Travancore state also broke out a movement against the princely rulers and prime minister, and the prime minister of the state was even forced to resign. The labor movement has also developed greatly in Kerala, and the Communist Party has a huge influence in trade unions. Youth and women's organizations are all conducting activities under the leadership of the Communist Party. The organization of the Communist Party of India in Kerala is relatively strong. At the same time, the Communist Party's policy of striving for and uniting all democratic forces has also achieved good results.

The previous government of Kerala was led by the Indian People's Socialist Party. In the 1954 election, the Indian National Congress failed to gain a majority in the Legislative Assembly, and the People's Socialist Party formed the state government. The People's Socialist Party abandoned the alliance formed with the left-wing coalition during the campaign, excluding the Communist Party of India from participating in the state government. However, the Communist Party of India is supported by the broad masses of workers and peasants in Kerala, and its influence is expanding. In particular, when provinces and states were redrawn last year, the Malabar region, where the Communist Party of India has a strong mass base, was划入into Kerala, which further guaranteed the victory of the CPI in the Legislative Assembly elections in this state.

Leaders of the Communist Party of India said that the Kerala state government organized by the CPI will strive for the support of the People's Socialist Party, govern within the scope of the Indian Constitution, implement the Second Five-Year Plan, and implement rent reduction and land reform policies.

    印度的喀拉拉邦
    在喀拉拉邦议会选举中获得大多数席位的印度共产党，即将组织新的邦政府。喀拉拉邦成了印度第一个由共产党人领导的行政区。
    喀拉拉邦位于印度半岛的西南部。它是去年11月印度调整行政区后新成立的一个邦，面积共一万五千零三十五英里，是印度十四个邦中最小的一个邦。全邦居民共一千三百五十六万人，人口密度之高为印度各邦之冠。居民是马拉雅拉人，主要操马拉雅拉语。60％的居民是印度教徒，25％是基督教徒，其余是伊斯兰教徒，首府是特里凡得琅。
    喀拉拉邦是由原来的特拉凡哥尔—科钦邦的大部分地区加上由临近的马德拉斯邦划进来的一小部分地区而组成的。喀拉拉是古代印度南部一个王朝的名称，有着悠久的历史。特拉凡哥尔邦在1888年便成立了议会。
    英国殖民势力很早便侵入了特拉凡哥尔邦，1684年英国资本在该邦的安占格建立工厂，掠夺那里的丰富资源和廉价劳动力。1795年，英国的东印度公司同特拉凡哥尔邦签订正式条约，把该邦变为英国的保护地。从1805年起，该邦每年要向英国上交八十万卢比的贡金。由于殖民主义者分而治之的政策，直到1923年，特拉凡哥尔邦才和印度政府发生直接关系。现在，英国资本在喀拉拉邦的主要经济部门中仍然占着统治地位。
    位于热带和沿海地区的喀拉拉邦有着丰富的自然资源。它的主要物产是椰子，还盛产茶、咖啡、胡椒、槟榔、橡胶，并出产蔗糖、葛粉、小豆蔻、芝麻、花生、生姜、柠檬草、郁金等多种多样的物品。大米是主要的粮食作物。在沿海广阔的沙洲中，还蕴藏着许多有重要经济价值的矿产，主要有铁、钛、矾土、钴石、柘榴石等。广大地区有着洁白的粘土、是陶器工业的原料。这里还有广阔繁茂的森林，盛产木材、木炭、竹子等林产品。
    工业在这个邦里也有相当的发展。据1954—1955年印度年鉴材料，原特拉凡哥尔——科钦邦注册的工厂有九百九十二个，在这些工厂中工作的工人有十一万一千多人。主要工厂有棉织厂、发电厂、瓷器厂等。农村的手工业和种植园很发达，最大的椰子皮纤维工业中，经常雇有五六十万名工人。喀拉拉邦的水陆交通都较便利，交通事业已经国有化。有一条从东到西沿着海岸通向首府特里凡得琅的长达一百英里的铁路。
    在印度各邦中，喀拉拉邦的文化教育事业比较发达，识字的人数的比例最高，约占60％—70％。据1954—1955年印度年鉴统计，原特拉凡哥尔—科钦邦有小学四千零八十六所，中学一千二百六十五所，特别学校一百六十所，高等学院三十九所，并有五所女子高等学院。这个邦的有些地区已经实现了免费的初级义务教育。对地方语文的重视是喀拉拉邦教育的特点。从初小起地方语（马拉雅拉语）便列为必修科，初中起印地语文也是必修科。英文是学校中主要的外国语文，但只在大学中才列为重要课程。
    长期以来，喀拉拉人民便展开了广泛的反帝反封建的群众运动。1921年和1930—1932年间在马拉巴地区都曾爆发大规模的农民运动。自1937年起，在马拉巴各区纷纷成立了农会，为争取减租而斗争。自从得到印度共产党的领导以来，喀拉拉的农民运动更为发展。在1946年的选举中，共产党人提出了在印度建立统一的喀拉拉的口号，得到广大人民的支持和拥护。特拉凡哥尔邦在1947年并爆发了反对土邦王公和首相的运动，土邦首相甚至一度被迫辞职。工人运动在喀拉拉也有很大发展，共产党在职工会拥有巨大的影响。青年和妇女组织都在共产党的领导下进行活动。印度共产党在喀拉拉的组织比较强大。同时，共产党执行的争取和团结一切民主力量的政策，也获得良好的效果。
    喀拉拉邦上届政府是由印度人民社会党领导的。1954年选举中，印度国大党在立法议会中未能取得多数，由人民社会党组织邦政府。人民社会党抛弃了在竞选中与左翼联合阵线结成的联盟，排斥印度共产党参加邦政府。但是，印度共产党在喀拉拉邦受到广大工人农民群众的拥护，它的影响日益扩大。特别是去年重划省邦时，印度共产党群众基础雄厚的马拉巴地区被划入喀拉拉邦，更保证了印共在这个邦的立法议会选举中的胜利。
    印度共产党领导人说，印共组织的喀拉拉邦政府，将争取人民社会党的支持，在印度宪法的范围内执政，执行第二个五年计划，实行减租和土地改革政策。　（梅）
