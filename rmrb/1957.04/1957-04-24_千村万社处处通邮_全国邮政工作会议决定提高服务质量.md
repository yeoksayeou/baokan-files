Postal services available in thousands of villages and communes
National Postal Work Conference Decides to Improve Service Quality

This newspaper reports: "Now, China's post offices, branches, and postal routes have penetrated all rural areas in the country." This was stated by Su Younong, Director of the Postal Bureau of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, in a report at the National Postal Work Conference held in Beijing from April 8th to 23rd.

Since liberation, the face of China's postal service has undergone fundamental changes. There are now more than 21,000 self-managed post offices and branches across the country, an increase of nearly seven times compared to the early days of liberation. There are more than 22,000 postal agencies and more than 85,000 mailboxes across the country, and the length of postal routes has reached more than 1.9 million kilometers. On average, each county has eight self-managed postal institutions. From the perspective of distribution, basically every district has a post office or branch, and postal routes have reached the townships, and some have reached agricultural cooperatives.

The conference pointed out that the main shortcomings and errors in postal work in recent years are: political work and management work have not kept up with the development of the business; corruption and theft are relatively serious; and there are many cases of mail backlog and loss; and the service attitude of some bureaus and branches is not good enough. In the future, it is necessary to strengthen political and ideological leadership, improve management, implement business systems, thereby eliminate corruption and theft, improve service quality, and reduce loss, backlog, and errors to a minimum.

The conference believes that postal work is mainly to transmit messages for the people, and finance itself does not produce material wealth. The task of increasing production and practicing economy is mainly to improve communication quality, improve work efficiency and equipment utilization, and give full play to the role of existing manpower and material resources. Those well-managed postal agencies should be retained. Those poorly managed agencies should, in principle, be cancelled. At present, the existing rural postal delivery force cannot undertake the task of delivering mail to agricultural cooperatives nationwide, and the state cannot add a large number of self-employed personnel in this area. Therefore, the conference determined the method of "employee," that is, to employ agricultural cooperative members. Employees can basically still engage in agricultural production. This will not only reduce state expenditures, but also strengthen the connection between employees and agricultural cooperatives, obtain the leadership and supervision of the cooperative, and improve service quality.

    千村万社处处通邮
    全国邮政工作会议决定提高服务质量
    本报讯　“现在，我国的邮政局、所和邮路已经深入到全国所有的农村。”这是4月8日到23日在北京举行的全国邮政工作会议上，邮电部邮政总局苏幼农局长所作的报告中说的。
    解放以来，我国的邮政面貌已经起了根本的变化。全国已有自办的邮政局、所二万一千多个，比解放初期增加了将近七倍。全国有邮政代办所二万二千多处，信箱八万五千多个，邮路长度已达一百九十多万公里。平均每县已有八个自办的邮政机构。从分布来看，基本上每个区都有了邮政局或所，邮路已经到了乡，有的到了农业合作社。
    会议指出了几年来邮政工作主要的缺点和错误是：政治工作和管理工作跟不上业务的发展，贪污盗窃现象比较严重，积压和丢失邮件的现象也不少；有的局所的服务态度也不够好。今后必须加强政治思想领导，改进管理工作，贯彻业务制度，从而消灭贪污盗窃现象，提高服务质量，把丢失、积压差错减低到最低程度。
    会议认为，邮政工作主要是为人民传递消息，财务本身并不生产物质财富，增产节约的任务主要就是提高通信质量，提高工作效率和设备利用率，充分发挥现有人力物力的作用。对那些办得好的邮政代办所，应予以保留。对那些办得很不好的代办所，原则上应予取消。目前，现有的乡村邮递力量，担负不了在全国范围内邮件投送到农业社的任务，而国家又不可能在这方面大量增添自编人员，因此，会议确定“雇员”的办法，即雇用农业社社员。雇员基本上仍能从事农业生产。这样既减少国家开支，又加强雇员与农业社的联系，得到社的领导监督，提高服务质量。
