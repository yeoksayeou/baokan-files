    "Buying on Credit"
    Lan Rongting, the director of the Gaoshan Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Rong County, Sichuan, often uses his position to take advantage of public property. In December 1954, he needed yarn, so he went to the warehouse and selected one jin and two liang of "Heli Brand" yarn without even writing an IOU. In November 1955 and January 1956, he successively took away woolen cloth, thermos bottles, and other goods on credit. The total value was more than 120 yuan. Over the past three years, he has only repaid a portion, and still owes 78 yuan. Whenever payday comes, he has many excuses for delaying repayment: "My woman at home (referring to his wife) needs to sew clothes, so don't deduct it this month." Or he would say: "The family has few quilts, and there are none for guests to use, so I need to make a quilt this month, don't deduct it," and so on.
    Last December, Director Lan came up with a new "trick": applying for a subsidy. The reason was: the family's burden is relatively heavy, there are many debts, and there is no money to make cotton-padded clothes... Therefore, he "hopes the leadership will understand and handle it appropriately." This means that not only should the arrears not be deducted, but he should also be "subsidized" a bit.
    This style of work is not isolated in the Gaoshan Cooperative. The former director, Xu Xuebin (now transferred to the Rong County Food and Beverage Company as manager), has been in arrears for eight-four yuan for woolen yarn, woolen cloth, etc., for three years now. Some cadres below also follow suit. According to incomplete statistics, the current amount of credit sales owed by cadres of the Gaoshan Cooperative (including a few comrades who have been transferred) amounts to 614 yuan and 1 jiao and 5 fen. More than 70% of this has not been recovered. This has also affected the unsound operation and management system. The cooperative has not urged the collection of farmers' debts and cadres' errors, accumulating about 5,000 yuan of state funds, accounting for 21% of the members' share capital. Yan Yin, Ye Nan

### “赊欠”

    “赊欠”
    四川荣县高山供销合作社主任蓝荣廷，经常利用职权占公家便宜。1954年12月，他需要毛线，就到仓库去选了“合力牌”毛线一斤二两，欠条也不打一张。1955年11月和1956年1月，先后又赊去毛呢、热水瓶等货。总计值一百二十多元。三年中除归还一部外，至今还欠七十八元。每当发薪时他有很多推脱还账的办法：“屋头女同志（指爱人）要缝穿的，这个月不扣”。或者说：“家里被盖少，来了客没有盖的，这个月要制一床被，不要扣”等等。
    去年12月，蓝主任又想出了新“窍门”：申请补助。理由是：家里较重，负债也多，缝制棉衣还没有钱……于是“希领导了解并作适当处理”。这就是说，不但不应扣欠款，还得“补助”他一些才对。
    这种作风在高山社并不是个别的。前社主任徐学彬（现已调任荣县饮食业公司经理）因赊毛线、毛呢等拖欠公款八十四元，至今已跨越三个年度了。下面有些干部也相效犹，据不完全统计，目前高山社干部（包括已调走的少数同志）的赊销款达六百十四元一角五分，至今还有70％以上没有收回。因而也影响到经营管理制度不健全，对农民赊欠、干部差错款等一直未催收处理，积压了国家资金约五千元，占社员股金21％。　燕吟、叶柟
