    About Mirrors
    An article titled "Also Talking About Mirrors" by Huang Miaozi was published on page 8 of the People's Daily on April 12th. There are two points worth discussing.
    First, the author identifies the "heavenly horse and grape" mirror as a Han mirror and connects it with the Han Dynasty's interactions with the Western Regions. In fact, the "heavenly horse and grape" mirror is from the Tang Dynasty and is also known as the "sea beast and grape" mirror or the "divine beast and grape" mirror. Some epigraphers and historians have already made correct datings in their writings (such as Liang Shangchun's "Mirrors Hidden in Caves" and Xiang Da's "Chang'an and Western Civilization in the Tang Dynasty"). After liberation, archaeological workers have also repeatedly discovered them in the scientific excavations of Tang tombs in Xi'an and Luoyang.
    Second, the author believes that the main raw material for Han mirrors, copper, was produced in Danyang during the Han Dynasty, which is correct. However, he locates the Han Dynasty Danyang in the west of Yichuan County, Shaanxi Province, which is wrong. Recently, in "Historical Research" (1957, No. 2), Mr. Qiu Chenyao's article "A Study of Danyang, a Famous Copper Producing Area in the Han Dynasty," based on sufficient historical materials, proves that the Han Dynasty Danyang was in present-day Dangtu County, Anhui Province.

    关于镜子
    人民日报4月12日第八版刊载黄苗子作的“也谈镜子”一文，有两处是值得商量的。
    一、作者把天马葡萄镜认为汉镜，并与汉通西域的事联系起来了，其实天马葡萄镜是唐代的，有人亦称它叫海兽葡萄镜或神兽葡萄镜。有些金石学家和史学家的著述（前者如梁上椿的“岩窟藏镜”，后者如向达先生的“唐代长安与西域文明”）中，都已作了正确的断代。解放后，考古工作者在科学发掘西安、洛阳的唐墓中，也迭有发现。
    二、作者认为汉镜的主要原料铜的产地在汉代丹阳，这是对的，但是他把汉代的丹阳定在现在的陕西宜川县西，那就错了。最近“历史研究”（1957年第2期）有裘忱耀先生的“汉代著名产铜地丹阳考”一文，根据充分的史料，证明汉代丹阳是在现在的安徽省当涂县。
