At the Beijing People's Welcome Rally
Mayor Peng Zhen's Welcome Speech

Respected Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Comrade Cyrankiewicz, respected comrades of the Government Delegation of the People's Republic of Poland, comrades and friends:

Today, people from all walks of life in Beijing gather here to welcome the Polish Government Delegation headed by Comrade Cyrankiewicz to visit our country. On behalf of all the people of Beijing, I extend my heartfelt welcome and respect to our distinguished guests.

For more than a decade, under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party and the Polish Government, the fraternal Polish people have achieved great success in the cause of socialist construction. Now, Poland is no longer a backward agricultural country, but an advanced socialist industrial nation. The Chinese people regard the achievements of the Polish people as our own achievements, as an inseparable part of the achievements of our socialist family. We are very happy for the great achievements made by the Polish people in socialist construction. The advanced experience created by the Polish people on the road of socialist construction, the strong perseverance, boundless enthusiasm, and fearless heroic spirit demonstrated in the cause of rebuilding Warsaw are all worthy of learning by the people of Beijing and the Chinese people.

In international affairs, the People's Republic of Poland is also continuing to play an increasingly important role. Whether in Europe, or in Asia and other parts of the world, the Polish people have always been unswerving fighters in safeguarding peace, developing friendly cooperation among the people of all countries, and opposing imperialist aggression and war policies. This visit to many Asian countries by the Polish Government Delegation headed by Comrade Cyrankiewicz is another vivid example. At the same time, we firmly believe that they will achieve new and greater achievements in these areas.

China and Poland are both members of the socialist family. The common goal of building socialism and communism closely links us together. In recent years, the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries in various fields have been continuously developed. We are very grateful to the Polish people for their support and assistance to our people in their struggle to safeguard their sovereignty and build socialism.

Respected Comrade Cyrankiewicz and all the comrades of the Polish Government Delegation, we are very happy and honored to welcome you to see what you want to see in Beijing and to contact the people you want to contact. We are deeply convinced that you will feel in Beijing, as our Premier Zhou Enlai deeply felt during his visit to Warsaw and other places in Poland, the unbreakable, eternal, and fraternal friendship between the people of China and Poland. Please take back to the Polish people the profound friendship of the Chinese people.

Long live the unbreakable friendship and unity between the people of China and Poland!
Long live the great unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union!
Long live world peace!

    建设社会主义的共同目标把中波两国人民紧密地连结在一起
    在北京各界人民欢迎大会上
    彭真市长的欢迎词敬爱的部长会议主席西伦凯维兹同志，敬爱的波兰人民共和国政府代表团的全体同志们，同志们和朋友们：
    今天，我们北京各界人民聚集在一起，欢迎以西伦凯维兹同志为首的波兰政府代表团前来访问我们的国家。我代表北京市全体人民向我们的贵宾们表示衷心的欢迎和敬意。
    十几年来，兄弟的波兰人民在波兰统一工人党和波兰政府的领导下，在社会主义建设事业中获得了巨大的成绩。现在，波兰已经不再是一个落后的农业国家，而是一个社会主义的先进的工业国。我们中国人民把波兰人民的成就看作是我们自己的成就，看作是我们社会主义国家大家庭的成就的一个不可分割的部分。我们为波兰人民在社会主义建设中所取得的巨大成就感到十分高兴。波兰人民在社会主义建设的前进道路上所创造的先进经验，在重建华沙城的事业中表现出来的建设社会主义祖国的坚强毅力、无限热情和大无畏的英雄气概，都是值得我们北京人民和中国人民学习的。
    在国际事务中，波兰人民共和国也正在继续起着日益重要的作用。无论在欧洲，或是在亚洲和世界其他地区，波兰人民都始终是维护和平、发展各国人民的友好合作事业、反对帝国主义的侵略和战争政策的坚持不懈的战士。这次以西伦凯维兹同志为首的波兰政府代表团对亚洲许多国家的访问，就是又一个生动的例证。同时我们深信，他们必将在这些方面获得新的更大的成就。
    中、波两国都是社会主义国家大家庭的一员。建设社会主义和共产主义的共同目标把我们紧密地连结在一起。几年来，我们两国在各方面的友好合作关系都得到了不断的发展。波兰人民对我国人民维护自己主权的斗争和建设社会主义的事业所给予的种种支持和帮助，使我们十分感谢。
    敬爱的西伦凯维兹同志和波兰政府代表团的全体同志们，我们十分高兴地、光荣地欢迎你们在北京看你们所要看的东西，同你们所要接触的人接触。我们深信，你们在北京也会像我国周恩来总理在访问华沙和波兰其他地方时所深深感觉到的那样，感觉到中波两国人民间牢不可破的、永恒的、兄弟般的友谊。请你们把我们中国人民对波兰人民的深厚友谊带回去。
    中、波两国人民牢不可破的友谊和团结万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义各国的强大团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
