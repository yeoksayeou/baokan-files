Responding to the Call to Conserve Cotton Cloth

    Use Less Cloth, Produce More
    Zhang Xingdi, Yao Shu'e, Textile Labor Models of Beijing Municipality
    Given the current insufficient cotton cloth production, the government is doing the right thing.

    Last year was a year with relatively more clothing additions. Almost everyone had several pieces of clothing, both new and old. Although the second round of cloth ration coupons has been reduced this year, this difficulty can be completely overcome as long as everyone makes full use of the old ones.

    We are textile workers, and we will definitely actively respond to the country's call. On the one hand, we will not buy clothes unless it is absolutely necessary, and we will make full use of old clothes as much as possible. On the other hand, we must make full use of raw materials, improve the quality of cotton cloth, produce less defective cloth, and increase production. (Attached picture)

专栏：响应号召，节约棉布

    少用布，多生产
    北京市纺织劳动模范  章杏娣　姚淑娥
    在目前棉布生产不足的情况下，政府这样做很正确。
    去年，是添置衣服比较多的一年，每个人差不多连新带旧的都有了几件衣服。今年第二期的布票虽然打了折扣，但是，只要大家充分利用旧的，目前这个困难完全可以克服。
    我们是纺织工人，我们一定积极响应国家的号召，一方面做到不是必要买的衣服，一定不买；尽量利用旧衣服。另一方面，我们要充分利用原材料，提高棉布质量，少出坏布，增加生产。（附图片）
