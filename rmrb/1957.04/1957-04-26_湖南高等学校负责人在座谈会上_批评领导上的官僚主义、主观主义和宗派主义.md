Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, April 25th: The Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened leaders of six universities and colleges in the province, along with some professors, for a symposium on issues of internal contradictions among the people. Zhang Jichun, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Zhou Xiaozhou, First Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Zhou Li, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Provincial Committee, participated in group discussions. The symposium lasted for eleven days, concluding on the 22nd.

The thirty-eight non-Party figures who participated in the symposium spoke frankly and openly, expressing their opinions wholeheartedly. They focused on criticizing bureaucratism, subjectivism, and sectarianism in the leadership of the Party and government in Hunan Province. Ling Minyou, President of Hunan Medical College, Deng Yiwei, President of the affiliated hospital of Hunan Medical College, and others criticized the current phenomenon of excessive leadership in universities and colleges, where responsibilities are unclear, leading to "too many fathers, too few mothers, too much management, and too little care."

Participants believed that in recent years, due to the sectarian tendencies of some Party leaders and the rigid and crude working methods of individual Party members, there were still some misunderstandings and estrangement in cooperation with certain non-Party members in the colleges. Li Yinqiu, a professor at the Central South Institute of Civil Engineering and Architecture, earnestly suggested that Communist Party members should not only be like magnets, only able to attract iron and steel, but should be like cement, binding together dust and dirt. Zhou Xiaozhou, First Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, while listening to the professors' opinions, strictly criticized the simplistic and crude behavior of individual Party members in their cooperation and work with non-Party members, and requested that non-Party members offer more suggestions to help the Party rectify its work style. Wei Dongming (a Communist Party member), Vice President of the Central South Institute of Civil Engineering and Architecture, examined his past simplistic and crude working methods and expressed his determination to improve them in the future.

    湖南高等学校负责人在座谈会上
    批评领导上的官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义
    据新华社长沙25日电　中共湖南省委员会召集全省六所高等学校的负责人和一部分教授，座谈人民内部矛盾问题。中共中央宣传部副部长张际春，中共湖南省委第一书记周小舟，省委书记处书记周礼等分别参加了小组讨论会。座谈会进行了十一天，到22日结束。
    参加座谈会的三十八位党外人士都开诚布公，倾心畅谈了自己的意见，比较集中地批评了湖南省党政领导上的官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义。湖南医学院院长凌敏猷，湖南医学院附属医院院长邓一韪等人士对目前高等学校领导多、职责不明形成“老子多、妈妈少、管的多、关心少”等现象提出批评。
    参加会的人认为这几年来在学院里，由于一些党员领导干部存在宗派主义情绪和个别党员工作方法生硬、粗暴，以致同某些非党人士合作时还有些误会和隔阂。中南土木建筑学院教授李吟秋恳切地提出，希望共产党员不要光像吸铁石，只能吸住钢铁，要像士敏土（水泥）一样，把灰尘土屑也通通凝结在一起。中共湖南省委第一书记周小舟在听取教授们意见时，随时对个别党员和非党人士合作共事中的简单粗暴行为进行了严格批评，并要求非党人士多提意见，帮助党内整顿工作作风。中南土木建筑学院副院长魏东明（共产党员）检查了过去简单粗暴的工作方法，表示今后努力改进。
