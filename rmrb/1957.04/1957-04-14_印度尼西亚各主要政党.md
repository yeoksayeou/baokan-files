To the Editor of People's Daily:

We are very concerned about the recent political situation in Indonesia. Could you briefly introduce the situation of the various political parties in Indonesia?

Reader Zheng Ming Xiao Bo

Comrade Zheng Ming Xiao Bo:

There are more than thirty political parties in Indonesia. Twenty-eight parties have at least one seat in the current parliament. Here is an introduction to the main political parties in the parliament:

Indonesian Nationalist Party

The Indonesian Nationalist Party was founded in 1927 by Sukarno and others. Its main program was to fight for an independent Indonesia. In 1929, the Dutch colonial government arrested Nationalist Party leaders Sukarno and others. In 1931, the Indonesian Nationalist Party was forced to announce its dissolution. Later, the Nationalist Party leaders organized the "Indonesian Party" and the "Indonesian Education Association" separately. Sukarno joined the "Indonesian Party" after his release from prison, while the "Indonesian Education Association" was led by Hatta. After Indonesia's independence in 1945, the Indonesian Nationalist Party was re-established on January 29, 1946. In December 1948, some right-wing figures from the Nationalist Party announced their secession and formed the "Greater Indonesian Unity Party." In July 1950, a faction led by Zodi formed the "National People's Party." Currently, the Nationalist Party has approximately seven million members, and the chairman is Suwirjo.

The Indonesian Nationalist Party advocates the "Five Principles" (Nationalism, Democracy, Humanitarianism, Belief in God, and Social Justice) advocated by Sukarno as the principles for nation-building, and advocates the establishment of a unicameral parliament. In foreign affairs, it advocates a policy of peaceful neutrality, adhering to national independence and safeguarding sovereignty.

In the last general election, the Indonesian Nationalist Party received more than 8.4 million votes, accounting for 57 seats in the parliament, making it the largest party in the country.

Apart from the Natsir Cabinet, the Indonesian Nationalist Party has held major positions in all previous cabinets. During the Wilopo Cabinet, it held positions such as Prime Minister, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Economy, and Minister of Information. In the First Ali Cabinet in 1953 and the Second Ali Cabinet after the general election, it held positions such as Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs. In addition to having a relatively large influence in government departments, the Nationalist Party also has influence in the military. In the last general election, the Nationalist Party received 35% of the votes from soldiers, the most of any party.

The mass organizations led by the Nationalist Party include the "Indonesian Trade Union Federation," the "Indonesian National Farmers Association," the "Indonesian Republic Women's Association," and the "Indonesian Democratic Youth." Its main newspaper is the "Indonesian Torch."

Masyumi Party

The Masyumi Party was founded in 1945, composed of more than twenty Islamic organizations, and is the largest Islamic party in Indonesia. It claims to have ten million members, and the chairman is Natsir. It promotes the supremacy of Islam and advocates the establishment of a 100% Islamic state. In its new party program, it advocates imitating the American government system and implementing a presidential cabinet. It advocates relying on foreign investment to develop resources.

There are many factions within the Masyumi Party. In July 1947, the "Indonesian Islamic League Party" seceded from the Masyumi Party. In August 1952, the "Islamic Teachers Association" also announced its secession from the Masyumi Party. Currently, the party is mainly divided into two factions: the Sukiman faction and the Natsir faction.

The religious and mass organizations led by the Masyumi Party include the "Indonesian Islamic Farmers Federation," the "Indonesian Islamic Workers Union," the "Indonesian Islamic Students Association," the "Indonesian Islamic Youth Promotion Association," and the "Indonesian Islamic Business Federation," etc. Its newspaper is the "Eternal Daily."

The Masyumi Party has served as Prime Minister four times in seventeen cabinets. In the last general election, the Masyumi Party received more than 7.9 million votes, accounting for 57 seats in the parliament.

Islamic Teachers Association

The Islamic Teachers Association was founded in 1926. It was originally a religious organization. In 1945, it joined the Masyumi Party as a "special member." In 1952, it withdrew and became a political party in its own right. The current chairman is Chalid. It advocates the establishment of a nation-state based on Islamic doctrine and supports a policy of peaceful neutrality against colonialism in foreign affairs. It has many religious schools in Java, South Kalimantan, and Sumatra, and has considerable influence among Muslims. In the last general election, it received more than 6.95 million votes, accounting for 45 seats in the parliament. Its newspaper is the "Social Messenger."

Communist Party of Indonesia

The Communist Party of Indonesia was founded in 1920. It currently has about one million members, and the General Secretary is Aidit. In 1926, the Communist Party of Indonesia led the armed struggle of the masses against the Dutch colonialists. Later, it was forced to go underground. During the Japanese occupation, the Communist Party led the people to launch an anti-Japanese struggle and strive for national liberation. After Indonesia's independence, the Communist Party, together with the patriotic and progressive forces of Indonesia, carried out a persistent struggle to consolidate national independence, defend peace, and strive for social progress.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of Indonesia are mass organizations such as the Indonesian General Confederation of Trade Unions and farmers, youth, and women. The party's newspaper is the "People's Daily," and its journals include "Red Star Monthly" and "Party Life."

In the last general election, the Communist Party of Indonesia received more than 6.17 million votes, accounting for 39 seats in the parliament, making it the fourth largest party in the country.

Islamic Union Party

The Islamic Union Party is the oldest political party in Indonesia. Its predecessor was the Islamic Commercial Union, founded in 1911. It was renamed to its current name in 1929. After independence in 1945, most of the party's leaders joined the Masyumi Party, and then seceded from the Masyumi Party in 1947. The chairman of the party is Kartawinata. The Islamic Union Party advocates the establishment of an Islamic state, advocating that national law be based on Islamic doctrine and the establishment of a theocratic state. Its newspaper is the "Observer." In the last general election, it received more than 1.09 million votes, accounting for eight seats in the parliament.

Indonesian Socialist Party

In 1945, the Socialist People's Party organized by Sjahrir merged with the Indonesian Socialist Party to form the Socialist Party. The Socialist Party soon split again. In 1948, Sjahrir formed the Indonesian Socialist Party.

The current chairman of the Indonesian Socialist Party is Sjahrir, and its newspaper is the "Compass." This party advocates anti-communism and has close ties with imperialism. The Socialist Party was originally also a larger political party, but in the last general election, its power was greatly weakened, and it only received more than 750,000 votes, accounting for five seats in the parliament.

    印度尼西亚各主要政党编辑同志：
    我们很关心最近印度尼西亚的政治局势。对于印度尼西亚各政党的情况，你们是否可以简单地介绍一下？
                                        读者郑明　萧波郑明　萧波同志：
    印度尼西亚的政党总计有三十多个。在本届国会内拥有一席以上的党派就有二十八个。现将国会主要政党介绍如下：
    印度尼西亚国民党
    印度尼西亚国民党是在1927年由苏加诺等发起成立的。它的主要纲领是为争取独立的印度尼西亚而斗争。1929年荷兰殖民政府逮捕了国民党领袖苏加诺等人。1931年印度尼西亚国民党被迫宣布解散。后来，国民党领袖又分别组织了“印度尼西亚党”和“印度尼西亚教育会”，苏加诺出狱后参加了“印度尼西亚党”，“印度尼西亚教育会”则由哈达领导。1945年印度尼西亚独立后，印度尼西亚国民党又于1946年1月29日重新成立。1948年12月，国民党一部分右派人士宣布脱党，另组“大印度尼西亚统一党”，1950年7月以佐弟为首的一派又另组“国家人民党”。目前国民党约有七百万党员，总主席是苏维约。
    印度尼西亚国民党主张以苏加诺所倡导的“五基”（民族主义、民主主义、人道主义、信仰上帝和社会公平）为建国原则，主张成立一院制国会。在外交方面主张实行和平中立政策，坚持民族独立和维护主权。
    在上届普选中，印度尼西亚国民党获得八百四十万余票，在国会中占五十七席，为全国第一大党。
    除了纳席尔内阁外，印度尼西亚国民党在历届内阁中都占有主要职位。在韦洛坡内阁时占总理、外交、经济和情报部长等职，在1953年第一届阿里内阁和普选后第二届阿里内阁中占总理、外交部长等职。国民党除了在政府部门有比较大的力量外，在军队中也有影响。在上届普选中，国民党得到军人选票的35％，为各党派中最多的。

    马斯友美党成立于1945年，由二十多个伊斯兰教团体组成，是印度尼西亚最大的伊斯兰教政党。号称有一千万党员，总主席是纳席尔。它宣传伊斯兰教至上，主张建立百分之百的伊斯兰教国。在新党纲中主张模仿美国的政府制度，实行总统制内阁。主张依靠外资，开发资源。
    马斯友美党党内有许多派系。1947年7月，“印度尼西亚伊斯兰联盟党”脱离了马斯友美党。1952年8月，“伊斯兰教师联合会”也宣布脱离了马斯友美党。目前该党主要分两派：苏基曼派和纳席尔派。
