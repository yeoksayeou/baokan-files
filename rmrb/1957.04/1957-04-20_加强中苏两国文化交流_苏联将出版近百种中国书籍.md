Strengthening Cultural Exchange Between China and the Soviet Union
The Soviet Union to Publish Nearly One Hundred Chinese Books
(Our newspaper, Moscow, 19th dispatch by reporter Li He) The number of books by Chinese authors translated and published in the Soviet Union is increasing year by year. According to information obtained from the Soviet Ministry of Culture and publishing houses, in previous years the Soviet Union translated and published about forty or fifty kinds of Chinese books each year, while this year it will translate and publish nearly one hundred kinds of books by Chinese authors and fifty kinds of illustrations.

From January this year, the Political Books Publishing House published the documents of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, and the Pravda Publishing House published "On the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat." These two books, like the Selected Works of Mao Zedong, have become common reading materials on the bookshelves of Soviet people.

The scope of Soviet publications of works by Chinese authors this year is very broad. The Political Books Publishing House will publish a two-volume "Selected Works of Sun Yat-sen." The Foreign Languages Publishing House will publish Peng Ming's "A Brief History of Friendship Between the Chinese and Soviet Peoples," Yang Rongguo's "A History of Ancient Chinese Thought," "Chinese Economic History from 1940 to 1948," "Chinese Natural Geography," "Chinese Economic Geography," "Chinese Agricultural Geography," "A Day of the Volunteers," and Qian Weichang's papers on the large deflection problem of elastic circular thin plates. After publishing selections of poems by Qu Yuan and Du Fu, as well as selections of works by Lu Xun, Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, and Liu Baiyu, the Foreign Literature Publishing House will publish this year the Book of Songs, selections of poems by Li Bai and Bai Juyi, selections from Pu Songling's "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio," a collection of Chinese stories, a collection of novels by modern Chinese writers, a collection of literary essays by Lu Xun, and selections from Lao She, Zhao Shuli, and Zhang Tianyi. Following the publication of Ba Jin's "Family" last year, his "Spring" and "Autumn" will be published this year. The Military Books Publishing House will publish Du Pengcheng's "Defend Yan'an," "The People's Liberation Army During the War of Resistance Against Japan," and "An Overview of the Third Domestic Revolutionary War." The Publishing House of the Soviet Academy of Sciences will publish Fan Wenlan's "A Concise General History of China" and Lü Shuxiang's works on Chinese grammar. The Technical Books Publishing House will publish Li Yan's "History of Chinese Mathematics." The Fine Arts Publishing House will publish a collection of prints by modern Chinese painters.

The Soviet publishing industry maintains certain contacts with the Chinese publishing industry. Soviet publishing houses have correspondence and book exchange relationships with thirty-five Chinese publishing houses. Soviet publishing houses send the publication plans for translated books to all Chinese publishing houses. Soviet comrades expressed to reporters their willingness to further develop friendly relations. The responsible comrades of the Foreign Languages Publishing House said: "We hope to have extensive and close contact with the Chinese publishing industry. We need more and better cooperation so that the people of our two countries can understand each other more and better."

    加强中苏两国文化交流
    苏联将出版近百种中国书籍
    本报莫斯科19日电　本报记者李何报道：苏联翻译和出版的中国作者著作的书籍一年比一年增加。从苏联文化部和出版社得到的消息，前几年每年苏联翻译和出版的中国书籍约四、五十种，而今年要翻译和出版近百种中国作者著作的书籍和五十种图画。
    从今年1月，政治书籍出版社出版了中国共产党第八次全国代表大会文献，真理报出版社出版了“再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”。这两本书和毛泽东选集一样，已经成为苏联人书橱里常见的读物。
    苏联今年出版中国作者著作的范围很广。政治书籍出版社将出版“孙中山选集”两卷。外国书籍出版社将出版彭明的“中苏人民友谊简史”、杨荣国的“中国古代思想史”、“1940年到1948年的中国经济史”、“中国自然地理”、“中国经济地理”、“中国农业地理”、“志愿军一日”、钱伟长等关于弹性圆薄板大挠度问题的论文。外国文学书籍出版社在出版了屈原和杜甫的诗选以及鲁迅、郭沫若、茅盾、刘白羽的选集以后，今年将出版诗经、李白和白居易的诗选、蒲松龄的聊斋志异选、中国故事集、现代中国作家小说集、鲁迅文学论文集以及老舍、赵树理、张天翼的选集。继去年出版巴金的“家”之后，今年将出版他的“春”和“秋”。军事书籍出版社将出版杜鹏程的“保卫延安”，“抗日战争时期的人民解放军”、“第三次国内革命战争概况”。苏联科学院出版社将出版范文澜的“中国通史简编”，吕叔湘关于中国语法的著作。技术书籍出版社将出版李俨的“中国算学史”。图画出版社将出版中国现代画家的版画集。
    苏联出版界和中国出版界保持一定的联系。苏联出版社和中国的三十五个出版社有书信往来和交换书籍的关系。苏联出版社把翻译书籍的出版计划寄给中国所有的出版社。苏联同志对记者表示他们愿意进一步发展友好联系。外国书籍出版社的负责同志们说：“我们希望和中国出版界发生广泛的亲密的接触。我们需要更多地更好地合作，使得我们两国的人民彼此更多地更好地了解。”
