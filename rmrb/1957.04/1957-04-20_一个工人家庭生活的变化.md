Changes in the Life of a Worker's Family
	A worker's family with a medium standard of living has seen great improvements in their life over the past few years; however, the improvement has not been very rapid, and their current life cannot be considered very good.
	By our reporter, Ye Jianyun
	In order to specifically understand the actual situation of workers' family life and to understand what changes have taken place in workers' family life over the past few years, I conducted a survey of workers' family life at the Beijing No. 1 Automobile Accessories Factory in February 1957.
	This survey of workers' family life was conducted on the basis of a general understanding, and then typical households were selected for individual interviews. In the initial stage of general understanding, more than a dozen worker households were compared in terms of their wage income, the number of people they supported, and their daily expenses on clothing, food, housing, etc. The results of the comparison were divided into five types of workers' living conditions. (Note 1)
	The first type is affluent households. The worker's wage income, averaged by the number of people supported, is more than fifteen yuan per person per month. Their living conditions are: all eat refined grains, and meat is often consumed; if they do not live extravagantly, they can have monthly savings. This type of household is called a well-fed and well-clothed household, accounting for about 10% of the workers.
	The second type is upper-middle-class households. Averaged by the number of people supported, each person has twelve to fifteen yuan per month. In terms of living conditions, in addition to maintaining a diet mainly of refined grains and eating meat dishes every two to three days, if planned well, there may be slight monthly savings. This type of household accounts for about 32% of the total number of workers.
	The third type is middle-middle-class households. Averaged by the number of people supported, each person has ten to twelve yuan per month. The family living conditions of this type of household are that refined grains are the main staple, but some coarse grains must be eaten, and meat is not frequently consumed. Under normal circumstances, food, pocket money, and seasonal clothing can be taken care of. If life is well planned, in addition to balancing income and expenditure, a small amount of money can be saved each month. This type of household accounts for about 38% of the total number of workers.
	The fourth type is lower-middle-class households, which are also seasonal hardship households. Averaged by the number of people supported, each person has eight to ten yuan per month. Their living conditions are half coarse grains and half refined grains, and meat dishes are eaten once or twice a month; under normal circumstances, if planned well, they will not be completely broke at the beginning and end of the month. However, when it comes to seasonal clothing changes, and when the worker or their family members get sick, difficulties will arise. This type of household accounts for about 18% of the workers.
	The fifth type is households in constant difficulty. The average monthly income per person is less than eight yuan. The family living conditions of such families are mainly eating coarse grains, and vegetables are mainly pickles. Only one-third of the monthly oil ration can be used. There are only three or four opportunities to eat cooked dishes and stir-fried dishes a month. This type of household is almost non-existent among industrial workers. This situation only occurs among odd-job workers and other auxiliary workers engaged in simple labor because of their low income and many children. This type of person accounts for less than 1% of the total number of people in the First Automobile Accessories Factory. (Note 2)
	After gaining a general understanding of the situation and mastering the above-mentioned types of standards for workers' lives, an investigation was conducted on a typical household on this basis.
	The typical household selected this time was the family of Feng Guangzhi, a fifth-grade lathe worker in the mechanic repair workshop of the First Automobile Accessories Factory. Feng Guangzhi's monthly salary is 65.50 yuan. The whole family has six members, and the average living expense per person per month is 10.92 yuan. This is the middle-middle living standard of the third type in the Accessories Factory.
	What changes have taken place in the family life of this worker with a middle-middle standard of living over the past few years?
	Feng Guangzhi is 31 years old this year. He is from Xingtang County, Hebei Province. At the age of fifteen, he learned to weave socks and later switched to learning lathe work. The situation of the dependents is: his mother is 67 years old, her eyes are not good, and she can no longer cook or do needlework. She can only watch the door and take care of the children. His wife, Xian Jiying, is 27 years old and is responsible for all housework. The eldest daughter is six years old, the second daughter is three years old, and the third is a boy who is one and a half years old this year. The children are all at home.
	For the convenience of narration, the family life of Feng Guangzhi is divided into the following periods for introduction.
	Before Liberation
	In 1948, Feng Guangzhi worked in the ordnance repair shop of the 59th Division of the Kuomintang Army (in Jiawang near Xuzhou); his mother could not live on her own due to family poverty, so she moved in with her son. At that time, the pseudo-gold yuan bills were devalued, prices changed several times a day, and he was not paid on time. The money he earned could not support his mother. In order to eat, he relied on wearing a military uniform to steal coal from the Jiawang mine. The stolen coal was sold for a few cents just to make ends meet. The house they lived in was occupied from the common people.
	This was how this family lived during this period. In Feng Guangzhi's own words, they lived by stealing, and by being mad and wicked.
	From 1949 to February 1951
	After the Huaihai Campaign, the factory where Feng Guangzhi worked was taken over by the Ordnance Department of the East China Logistics Department of the People's Liberation Army. As soon as liberation came, he was rated as a 14th-grade worker, and his salary was calculated in millet, 245 kilograms per month. He had just gotten married, and the family of three was living a good life. In the summer of 1950, a child was born, and life began to become tense. Soon, the factory was streamlined, and everyone was mobilized to return to their hometown to engage in production. So they decided to return to their hometown.
	In order to find work, they came to Beijing again. Feng Guangzhi relied on his youth and strength to ride a tricycle. The first time he came to Beijing, he was not familiar with the roads, and it was impossible to pull a tricycle without knowing the way; there was no way, he could only pull from Xizhimen to Haidian. Business was not good, and he went to work as a temporary worker in a few days. His wife hoed the land for others, and the combined income of the two was less than sixteen yuan (Note 3). At this time, there were four people in the family eating. The average was less than four yuan per person per month. They ate sweet potatoes and sweet potato dried slices for every meal, and they only drank mush when they bought corn flour. They didn't use a drop of oil for a whole month, and the iron pot rusted. Fortunately, they lived in the suburbs, where there were many vegetable gardens, and they picked up the discarded vegetable heads and roots, soaked them in salt water and ate them with porridge. In this way, they only ate two meals a day, and sometimes they couldn't even eat two meals a day when it rained for days. Soon, the First Automobile Accessories Factory recruited lathe workers, and he was introduced by the labor department. He passed the exam in one go.
	From March 1951 to November 1951
	After entering the First Automobile Accessories Factory, his monthly salary was 30.80 yuan, and the average living expense per person per month for the whole family was 7.95 yuan. At this time, the monthly income was fixed, and the situation of being full and hungry at times changed to being able to eat cornbread. However, they still couldn't eat completely dry food, and sometimes they had to eat some thin food. When Feng Guangzhi came home on Sunday, he would make dumplings or steam a few buns for him, and the rest of the family would still eat coarse grains.
	The monthly expenditure during this period was as follows:
	Feng Guangzhi ate in the factory canteen: 9 yuan
	Staple food: 70 kilograms of corn flour: 7 yuan
	15 kilograms of millet: 1.65 yuan
	10 kilograms of white flour: 1.8 yuan
	Sweet potatoes or other grains: 2 yuan
	Non-staple food: Vegetables, etc., 8 cents per day: 2.4 yuan
	1 kilogram of oil, 2 kilograms of salt: 0.8 yuan
	Fuel: 250 kilograms of coal: 2.5 yuan
	25 kilograms of firewood: 0.5 yuan (some firewood can be picked up in the suburbs)
	Water and electricity: 0.7 yuan
	Pocket money (including towels, soap, needle and thread, toothbrush, toothpaste, etc.): 3 yuan
	Medical expenses: 1 yuan
	Total monthly expenditure: 32.35 yuan.
	His wife sometimes helped people with odd jobs, and the income was not fixed, averaging 2 yuan per month. Compared with the income and expenditure, they could barely make ends meet each month without going into debt.
	Compared with the previous period, in this period, in addition to a great improvement in the staple food, from eating sweet potato porridge to eating cornbread, and from two meals a day to three meals a day, they could eat more than one yuan worth of meat during the New Year and other holidays (mainly the Spring Festival). Although they still had to pick up vegetable scraps in the fields, with an average of eight cents of vegetable money per day, picking up vegetable scraps was no longer a necessity in life as it used to be. Of course, life was still very tight during this period. In addition to the above-mentioned necessary expenses, every penny had to be carefully considered. They wanted to buy a cutting board, but they couldn't bear to buy it after thinking about it for months. When he came home from the factory on Saturday, in order to save two cents, he only took the tram to Pinganli and couldn't bear to take it to Xizhimen. From Xizhimen to his residence in Landianchang, it was fifteen miles away, and he always ran home. There was no mat on the bed, and he couldn't afford to buy one, so he used sorghum leaves to weave a mat and managed to get by. During this period, they didn't let go of a single penny they could save.
	From November 1951 to November 1955
	In 1951, the eight-grade wage system was implemented, and Feng Guangzhi was rated as a fourth-grade worker. His monthly salary was 45 yuan. However, in 1954, another person was added to the family, and there were five people eating in the family.
	When Feng Guangzhi's monthly salary was 30.80 yuan, he didn't dare to buy even a pair of shorts. It was a good thing to spend one less penny. Now, it has suddenly increased by 14.20 yuan, and life seems to be much better. Indeed, during this period, he no longer needed to think for a long time in his mind to save a penny; he no longer got off the tram at Pinganli to save two cents. Sometimes he could take the bus from Xizhimen back to Landianchang. In 1952, the factory also allocated him a 12-square-meter house, and the whole family moved into the factory's dormitory. Not only was he not worried about eating cornbread, but also the staple food was mainly refined grains.
	The monthly family living expenses during this period were as follows:
	Staple food: 30 kilograms of white flour: 5.5 yuan.
	50 kilograms of rice: 7 yuan
	30 kilograms of corn flour: 3 yuan
	Sweet potatoes and other grains: 2 yuan
	Non-staple food: 3.5 kilograms of oil: 1.92 yuan
	Salt and soy sauce (I had never thought of eating soy sauce in the past. Later, after eating it once, the whole family said that it was delicious, and since then they ate one to two kilograms per month): 0.8 yuan
	Vegetables, etc., 30 cents per day: 9 yuan
	Meat or fish: 1.5 yuan
	Fuel: 400 kilograms of coal briquettes per month: 3.8 yuan
	50 kilograms of firewood: 1 yuan
	Rent, water and electricity: 3 yuan
	Pocket money (including soap, toothbrush, toothpaste, towel, shoe fabric, socks, needle and thread, movies, transportation): 5 yuan
	Total expenditure: 43.52 yuan
	However, due to the addition of one person, adults and children have rarely added clothes in the past few years. Not only was there no savings, but also a debt of 30 yuan was incurred. It turned out that the second child was born in September 1954, and the maternity expenses, adding some clothes and quilts for the child, immediately made the family run into deficit. In order to pay off this debt, the couple washed clothes for the factory employees for two months.
	Note 1: The five types here refer to workers who directly participate in production, excluding staff and miscellaneous workers, and security personnel.
	Note 2: The five types of living conditions listed refer to families with four or more dependents. A family of two with a monthly income of thirty yuan does not live as well as a family of six with a monthly income of sixty yuan. As the saying goes, "a thousand steamed buns and one pot of soup", which means that there are many people, and expenses can be spread out, so some savings can be made.
	Note 3: The yuan numbers listed in this article are all calculated in the new currency after the currency reform.

    一个工人家庭生活的变化
      中等生活水平的工人家庭，几年来生活有了很大的改善；但是提高得并不算很快，目前的生活也不能算太好。本报记者　叶剑韵
    为了具体了解工人家庭生活的实际情况，了解几年来工人的家庭生活起了什么样的变化，1957年2月间，我曾在北京第一汽车附件厂进行了一次工人家庭生活的调查。
    这次，对工人家庭生活的调查是在普遍了解的基础上，然后选择典型户进行个别访问的。在普遍了解的阶段，曾经就十几户工人，从他们的工资收入和供养的人口，以及日常的衣、食、住等开支方面加以比较；将比较的结果，分成工人生活状况的五种类型。（注一）
    第一种类型是富裕户。工人的工资收入按供养人口平均，每人每月在十五元以上者。他们的生活状况是：全部吃细粮，肉食经常；如果生活不铺张，可以做到月月有节余。这类户叫丰衣足食户，在工人中约占10％左右。
    第二种类型是中上等户。按供养人口平均，每人每月十二元至十五元者。生活状况除了保持以细粮为主，两三天内吃一次荤菜外，如果计划的好，每月稍有节余。这类户占工人总数的32％左右。
    第三种类型是中中等户。按供养人口平均，每人每月在十元至十二元者。这类户的家庭生活状况是，细粮为主必须吃部分粗粮，肉食不经常。在正常的情况下，伙食和零用、季节换衣可以自理。如果生活计划安排得好，除收支平衡外，每月可剩下少量的钱，这类户占工人总数的38％左右。
    第四种类型是中下等户，也就是季节性的困难户。按供养人口平均，每人每月在八元至十元者。他们的生活状况是粗细粮各半，一个月一两次荤菜；在正常情况下，如果计划的好，月头月尾不致于用的空空的。但到季节换衣，工人本身和家属生病时，就会发生困难。这类户在工人中所占的比例在18％左右。
    第五种类型是经常困难户。每人每月平均在八元以下者。这样的家庭生活状况是以吃粗粮为主，菜蔬以咸菜为主。每月发的油票只能用三分之一。吃熟菜炒菜的机会一月三四次。这类户在产业工人中几乎没有，只有在杂工及其他从事简单劳动的辅助工中，因为收入少孩子多，才会出现这种情况。这种人在第一汽车附件厂占不到全厂人数的1％。（注二）
    经过普遍了解情况，掌握了工人生活中上述几种类型标准以后，在这个基础上，对一家典型户进行了考察。
    这次选择的典型户是第一汽车附件厂机工修理车间五级车工冯广智的家庭。冯广智每月的工资是六十五元五角。全家六口，按供养人口平均，每人每月的生活费是十元九角二分。这是附件厂第三种类型中中等的生活水平。
    这个中中等生活水平的工人，几年来他的家庭生活经过了什么样的变化呢？
    冯广智，今年三十一岁。河北行唐县人。十五岁学织袜子，后来改学车工。供养人口的情况：母亲六十七岁，眼睛不好，做饭做针线都不行了，只能看看门照管孩子。妻子咸继英，二十七岁，负担全部家务。大女孩六岁，二女孩三岁，第三个是男孩，今年一岁半。孩子们全在家里。
    为了叙述方便起见，这里把冯广智的家庭生活分为如下几个时期来介绍。
    解放以前
    1948年，冯广智在国民党军五十九师修械所做工（在徐州附近的贾汪）；母亲由于家庭贫困，无法生活，就搬来和儿子一道住。当时伪金元券贬值，物价一日数变，又不按期关饷，挣的钱却养不活一个母亲。为了吃饭，就仗着身穿军装，到贾汪矿上去偷煤。偷来的煤三文不值二文卖几个钱将就过日子。住的房子，是靠占用民房。
    这个时期，这一家就是这样生活的。拿冯广智自己的话来说，是靠偷过日子，是靠依疯作邪过日子。
    1949年到1951年2月
    淮海战役后，冯广智所在厂由人民解放军华东后勤军械部接管。一解放，他被评为十四级工，工资以小米计算，每月二百四十五斤。新结婚，一家三口，生活还是不错的。1950年夏天生了个孩子，生活开始紧张起来了。不久厂里精简，动员大家回乡生产。他们也就决定回乡。
    为了找工作，他们又来到北京。冯广智依着自己年轻力壮，就去蹬三轮。第一次来北京，人生路不熟，拉三轮车不识路是不行的；没法，只能从西直门拉海淀，生意不好，不几天就做临时工去了。妻子给人家耪地，两人合计收入不足十六元
  （注三）。这时，家里是四口人吃饭。每人每月平均不足四元。顿顿吃白薯、白薯干，买点棒子面只喝糊涂。成个月不用一滴油，铁锅子都生了锈。幸好住在郊区，菜园很多，人家扔掉的菜头菜帮子捡回来用盐水泡了就粥吃。就这样，一天只吃两顿，连日阴雨，有时还吃不上两顿。不久，第一汽车附件厂招考车工，他经劳动部门介绍，一考就考上了。
    1951年3月到1951年11月
    考进第一汽车附件厂以后，每月工资是三十元八角，全家平均每人每月的生活费是七元九角五分。这时，每个月的收入固定了，由饱顿饿顿的情况转变到能够吃上棒子面的窝窝头。但是还不能尽吃干的，有时还得吃点稀的。星期天冯广智来家，给他包点饺子或蒸几个包子，其他一家人还是吃粗粮。
    这个时期每个月的支出情况是这样的：
    冯广智在厂里吃大伙九元
    主食：棒子面七十斤　七元
        小米十五斤　一·六五元
        白面十斤　一·八元
        白薯或其他杂粮　二元
    副食：蔬菜等每天八分　二·四元
        油一斤盐二斤　○·八元
    燃料：煤二百五十斤　二·五元
        劈柴二十五斤　○·五元（在郊区可以拾一些柴草）
    水电：○·七元
    零用（包括手巾、肥皂、针线、牙刷、牙粉等）：三元
    医药费：一元
    合计全月支出三十二元三角五分。
    他的妻子有时帮人家做零活，收入不固定，平均每月二元。收支相比，每个月将就得过，没拉账。
    这个时期与上期比较，除主食有很大改善，由吃白薯稀糊涂为主改为棒子面窝窝头，每天两顿改为三顿外，逢年过节
  （主要是过春节）能吃一元多钱的肉。虽然也要去地头捡菜帮子，但是每天平均有八分钱的菜金，捡菜帮子已不像过去那样成为生活上的必需了。当然，这个时期的生活过得还是很紧的。除了上述必需开支外，每用一分钱，都要经过几番斟酌。想买一块切菜板，考虑了几个月也没舍得买。星期六从厂里回家，为了省二分钱，坐电车只坐到平安里，不舍得坐到西直门。从西直门到住地蓝靛厂有十五里路，每次都是跑回家去。炕上没有席，抽不出钱买，只好用高粱叶子编了个垫子将就着过。这个时期是能省一分钱也不放过。
    1951年11月到1955年11月
    1951年实行了八级工资制，冯广智被评为四级工，每月工资收入是四十五元。但是到1954年又增加了一口人，家里是五口人吃饭。
    冯广智在每月工资三十元八角的时候，连条短裤叉也不敢买，少支出一分钱也是好事。现在，一下子增加了十四元二角，看上去日子好过多了。的确，在这一时期，再也用不着为了省一分钱脑子里要考虑半天了；坐电车也不再为了省二分钱在平安里下车了。从西直门回蓝靛厂有时也能乘坐公共汽车。1952年厂里还拨给他一间十二平方米的房子，全家也搬进厂子的宿舍里住了。不仅吃棒子面不发愁，而且主食是以细粮为主了。
    这个时期每个月家庭生活开支情况是这样的：
    主食：白面三十斤　五元五角。
          大米五十斤　七元
          棒子面三十斤　三元
          白薯等杂粮　二元
    副食：油三斤半　一元九角二分
          盐、酱油（过去从来没想吃酱油，后来吃过一次，全家说
                  这东西好吃，此后每月一斤二斤不等）八角
          蔬菜等每天三角　九元
          肉或鱼　一元五角
    燃料：煤球每月四百斤　三元八角
          劈柴五十斤　一元
    房租水电：三元
    零用　（包括肥皂、牙刷、牙粉、毛巾、鞋面布、袜子、针线、
          看电影、交通费）：五元
    合计支出四十三元五角二分
    但是，由于增加了一口人，几年来大人小孩都很少添衣服，不仅没有节余，而且还拉了三十元的账。原来1954年9月第二个孩子生下来了，生育费、给小孩添点衣服、被子，一下就用的亏空了。为了还清这笔账，夫妻两给本厂职工洗了两个月的衣服。
    注一：这里的五种类型是指直接参加生产的工人，不包括职员和
          杂工、警卫人员。
    注二：列举的五类生活状况，是指供养人员在四口以上的家庭。
          两口之家每月收入三十元，不及六口之家每月收入六十元
          日子过得好。俗说：“千个馒头一滚汤”，就是说人口
          多，在开支方面可以牵扯得着，因而可以节省一些。
    注三：本文列举的元数，都是以币制改革后的新币计算的。
                                                  （未完）
