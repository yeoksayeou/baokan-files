Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 6th: The construction project of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise will officially begin on the 8th. The vast and complex preparations for the plant construction have now been largely completed.

The preparations for the construction of the Wuhan Steel Plant were carried out in three aspects: design, construction, and ordering of production equipment. After more than five years of hard work by the builders and relevant departments, except for the production equipment which is still being ordered, other aspects are basically ready.

This iron and steel joint enterprise was designed by the Soviet Union at the request of our country. In order to provide the design unit with rich and reliable basis, the first batch of Wuhan Steel Plant staff members collected more than 700 copies of text and drawing materials, weighing more than 1,000 kilograms. During the collection of these materials, large-scale resource surveys and scientific experiments were conducted.

In order to select an ideal factory site, the Soviet experts and staff members of the site selection team pre-selected 23 factory sites and compiled hydrological data of the Wuhan area for more than 80 years and meteorological data for more than 50 years as the data needed for factory construction.

The construction teams gathered from all over the country at the construction site have been preparing for construction for more than a year. Now, various building materials have been successively transported into the factory site; railways, highways, and construction water and power lines have been densely distributed here; and various new construction shed areas have been erected in this vast construction area.

    武钢建厂准备工作完成
    据新华社武汉6日电　武汉钢铁联合企业的建设工程将在8日正式动工，浩繁、复杂的建厂准备工作现在已经基本完成。
    武钢建厂准备工作，是从设计、施工和订购生产设备三个方面进行的。经过建设者们和有关部门五年多的辛勤劳动，现在除了生产设备还在继续订购外，其他方面已经基本就绪。
    这个钢铁联合企业是由我国委托苏联设计的。为了给设计单位提供丰富可靠的依据，首批集结起来的武钢工作人员，曾经搜集了七百多本、重达一千多公斤的文字、图纸资料。在搜集这些资料过程中，曾进行了规模很大的资源勘测和科学试验工作。
    为了选择一个理想的厂址，选厂小组的苏联专家和工作人员曾经预选了二十三个厂址，编纂了武汉地区八十多年来的水文资料和五十多年来的气象资料，作为建厂所需要的资料。
    从全国各地汇集在施工现场的建设队伍，已经进行了一年多的施工准备。现在，各种建筑材料已经陆续运进厂地；铁路、公路及施工用水、用电线路，已经在这里纵横密布起来；各个新工棚区已经林立在这个辽阔的建筑区。
