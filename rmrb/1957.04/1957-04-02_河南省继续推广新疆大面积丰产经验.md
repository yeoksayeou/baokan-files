Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, April 1st: In order to strive for increased cotton field yields, Henan Province will continue to promote Xinjiang's experience in large-scale high-yield cotton farming this year.

After the cotton harvest in Henan Province last year, some people, based on shortcomings in the work in some areas that led to reduced yields in some cotton fields, said that Xinjiang's cotton planting experience was not suitable for Henan's conditions. This assertion is unfair. According to a survey in five special districts, due to the implementation of reasonable close planting based on Xinjiang's experience, under the same soil conditions, the yield was generally more than 40 jin per mu higher than that of sparse planting cotton fields. Last year, during the cotton flowering and boll-forming period, rainfall was about twice as much as in previous years, which not only flooded and abandoned 920,000 mu of cotton fields, but also caused severe boll shedding in general cotton fields. However, due to the implementation of Xinjiang's experience, the province's cotton output still increased by more than 2 million jin of lint compared with the bumper year of 1955.

Henan Province had shortcomings in promoting this experience last year. For example, some areas carried out close planting without adapting to local conditions; some areas formulated technical operating procedures that were too rigid, and rigidly implemented them even if they did not conform to local actual conditions, which seriously affected cotton production. These lessons have been accepted by agricultural technology promotion departments at all levels this year. They have made improvements in leading cotton farmers in various preparatory work, and have also begun to organize experienced old farmers from high-yield cotton-producing areas to be stationed in low-yield areas for long periods of time to teach technology.

This year, Henan Province plans to plant more than 13.29 million mu of cotton, with a planned increase of 25% in yield per unit area compared to last year.

### 河南省继续推广新疆大面积丰产经验

    河南省继续推广新疆大面积丰产经验
    据新华社郑州1日电　为了争取提高棉田产量，今年河南省将继续推广新疆棉花大面积丰产经验。
    河南省去年收棉之后，有些人根据部分地区工作上有缺点以致造成部分棉田减产的情况，便说新疆的植棉经验不适合河南的情况。这种论断是不公正的。据在五个专区的调查，由于根据新疆的经验，实行了合理密植，在同样的土质条件下，一般都比稀植的棉田每亩多收四十多斤。去年，正在棉花开花结铃时期，雨水比往年多了一倍左右，不但淹弃了九十二万亩棉田，而且使一般棉田严重落铃。但是，由于推行了新疆经验，全省棉花产量仍然比丰收的1955年，增产皮棉二百多万斤。
    去年河南省在推广这一经验中，是有缺点的。例如有些地区不因地制宜的密植；有些地区在制订技术操作规程方面订的过死，不符合当地实际情况也硬性推行，因而严重地影响了棉花的增产。这些教训在今年都已经为各级农业技术推广部门接受了。他们在领导棉农进行各种准备工作中已有改进，组织棉花高产区有经验的老农民，到低产区长期驻社传授技术的工作，也已经开始。
    今年河南省计划种棉一千三百二十九万多亩，单位面积产量计划比去年提高25％。
