How Long Will "Maintaining the Status Quo" Last?
    Since its establishment in July 1956, the Kunming Supply Station of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has become a unit that nobody cares about. The Nonferrous Metals Industry Bureau entrusted the Kunming Smelter to manage it on its behalf, but the smelter does not manage it either. Originally, the station's business was to supply raw materials to various nonferrous metal mines, but the materials are directly allocated by the ministry to each mine, and the supply station can't even get close to them.

    Therefore, although our station has sections for materials, finance, secretarial work, and transportation, each with five to ten cadres, except for the transportation section, which can work for two hours a day, the comrades in the other sections have no work at all. When they are at work, they read books and newspapers. Some comrades write diaries and read novels during working hours.

    Comrade Editor, we have endured this kind of life for almost nine months. Are the comrades loafing on the job? No. We are envious when we see others vigorously engaged in socialist construction, and ashamed of ourselves for eating and taking money for nothing, and wasting our time. Have we not taken the initiative to fight for work? No. In order to get work, we often argue endlessly with the leadership in meetings. Is it that the stationmaster is not working hard? No. The stationmaster has written reports to the Nonferrous Metals Industry Bureau many times; last December, the stationmaster even went to Beijing in person to ask for a solution. However, all these efforts have been in vain. Until recently, the Materials Department of the Nonferrous Metals Industry Bureau wrote to us, telling us: the personnel and work issues of your station will temporarily maintain the status quo. None of us knows how long this "status quo" will last, and when our idle hands will be able to do something for the socialist construction of the motherland?

    “维持”“现状”到几时
    冶金工业部有色金属工业管理局昆明供应站，自1956年7月成立以后，就成了个三不管的单位。有色金属工业管理局委托昆明冶炼厂代管，冶炼厂也不管。本来，站的业务工作，是供应各有色金属厂矿的原材料，但是，材料是由部直接分配到各厂矿，供应站连边都摸不着。
    因此我们站虽然设有材料、财务、秘书、运输等科，各科有干部五至十人，可是除了运输科一天能作两小时工作外，其他几个科的同志，根本没有工作，上班的时候，就看书看报。有的同志在工作时间就写日记、看小说。
    编辑同志，这样的生活已经熬过快九个月了。是同志们磨洋工吗？不是的。我们看别人轰轰烈烈搞社会主义建设看得眼红，为自己一天白吃饭、白拿钱、虚度光阴而羞愧。是我们没主动去争取工作吗？不是的。为了要工作，开会的时候，我们常常和领导上争论不休。是站长不努力吗？不是的。站长曾多次向有色金属工业管理局写过报告；去年12月份站长还亲自到北京去请示解决。但是，所有这一切努力都落空了。直到最近有色金属工业管理局材料处才写信告诉我们：你站人员和工作问题，暂时维持现状。我们每一个人都不知道这样的“现状”，还要“维持”多久，我们这闲置已久的双手，才能去为祖国的社会主义建设做些事情呢？
