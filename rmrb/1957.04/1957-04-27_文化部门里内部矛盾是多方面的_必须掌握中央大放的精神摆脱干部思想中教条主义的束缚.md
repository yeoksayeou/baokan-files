Xinhua News Agency, April 26th: The Ministry of Culture convened a meeting from the 23rd to the 25th, bringing together responsible individuals from the Ministry's internal departments and directly affiliated bureaus and associations, to discuss how to correctly handle the contradictions among the people, in light of the specific circumstances of the cultural system.

Prior to this, the Ministry of Culture had already conveyed and discussed Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference, but had not yet earnestly studied and implemented it. Some even believed that there were few contradictions among the people within the cultural departments. When some units conducted discussions in conjunction with their work, the masses raised many opinions about the leadership's style of work, but the leadership did not face up to the contradictory relationship between leaders and the led. Instead, they criticized some people for settling old scores, failing to boldly promote democracy, and mobilizing everyone to discuss and resolve contradictions. After a stimulating speech by Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of Culture, at this meeting, the method of situation assessment was adopted first. Responsible individuals from each department, bureau, and association presented the important problems existing in their units. Then, through discussion and analysis, they clarified the contradictory relationships in these problems and how to correctly deal with these contradictions.

What contradictions among the people currently exist within the cultural system? The meeting believed that the contradictions are multifaceted and complex. Judging from the preliminary information provided at the meeting, there are not only some internal contradictions between leaders and the led, Party members and non-Party members, and among different institutions, but also: the development of cultural undertakings cannot keep up with the people's needs for cultural life; the cultural departments do not have enough overall consideration for the cultural undertakings of the central and local governments, state-owned and private cultural undertakings, and the cultural undertakings among various ethnic groups; the combination of learning foreign cultural knowledge and absorbing the cultural traditions of the motherland is not sufficient; and the ideological and professional level of the leading cultural and artistic personnel is not adapted to the development of cultural undertakings. Among them, the contradiction between implementing the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" and the shackles of dogmatism in the thinking of cadres is particularly important and prominent.

The meeting believed that the current understanding of cadres in the cultural system regarding the idea of implementing "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" is small at both ends and large in the middle: only a few people can relatively correctly understand and grasp this policy; a few people are ideologically resistant to or do not pay attention to this policy; although most people accept this policy in principle and are gradually clarifying it ideologically, they still cannot open up basically and dare not fully express their opinions due to the shackles of dogmatism in their thinking. For example, some people say: the drama industry is different from other undertakings, and "letting go" and "spoiling" it will immediately affect tens of millions of viewers, so it should be "carefully 'let go'"; some people propose: in implementing "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" in the film industry, we should "strive for fragrant flowers and avoid poisonous weeds, but not be afraid of poisonous weeds"; in the publishing field, some people subjectively put forward many difficult problems as soon as they mention "letting go": "Does the policy allow contention on policy issues?" "What responsibility does the publishing house bear if the published book has erroneous views?" The meeting believed that the essence of these concerns is still fear of "letting go" and fear of "contending."

The meeting believed that the main reason for these phenomena and concerns is that these cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the new domestic situation pointed out by Chairman Mao, and have not considered the policy of "correctly handling contradictions among the people" and "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" in the context of the current entire domestic situation. Therefore, their thinking lags behind reality, and they cannot adopt new methods to solve the prominent contradictions among the people from the new situation.

The meeting pointed out that, in view of the above situation, the Ministry of Culture and the responsible individuals from each department, bureau, and association must repeatedly publicize the spirit of the Central Committee's unfettered expression to all cadres, convene cadre mobilization meetings, have responsible individuals give reports, organize all cadres to spend another month seriously studying Chairman Mao's speech and relevant People's Daily editorials, and put this study above all work. In the process of study, each unit must connect with reality and solve problems. Leading cadres must personally take action, investigate the situation, go among the masses, and adopt the method of mobilizing Party members and non-Party members to discuss together to solve one or two more prominent problems in their units, so as to more deeply understand the spirit of the document in practice, accumulate experience, and educate cadres. Then study and practice again, so that all cadres can truly deeply understand and master the Central Committee's policies and guidelines, unite all forces that can be united, further improve their work, prosper culture and art, and meet the people's growing needs for cultural life.

### 文化部门里内部矛盾是多方面的  必须掌握中央大放的精神摆脱干部思想中教条主义的束缚

    文化部门里内部矛盾是多方面的
    必须掌握中央大放的精神摆脱干部思想中教条主义的束缚
    新华社26日讯  23日到25日，文化部召集本部和直属各司、局，各个协会负责人举行会议，结合文化系统的具体情况，讨论如何正确地处理人民内部矛盾问题。
    在此以前，文化部已经传达和讨论过毛主席在最高国务会议上的讲话，但是还没有认真学习和切实贯彻，甚至有的人认为在文化部门里，人民内部矛盾不多。有的单位结合工作进行讨论时，群众对领导作风提出许多意见，但领导并没有正视领导和被领导之间的矛盾关系，反而批评有些人在算老账，不去放手发扬民主，发动大家讨论来解决矛盾。这次会议在文化部副部长钱俊瑞作了启发发言后，首先采取了情况排队的方法，由各司、局和各协会负责人把本单位存在的重要问题提出，然后经过讨论分析，明确这些问题中的矛盾关系和如何正确地对待这些矛盾。
    目前文化系统究竟存在着哪些人民内部矛盾？会议认为：矛盾是多方面的，复杂的，从会上初步提供出来的情况看，不仅有领导与被领导、党与非党、事业单位之间的一些内部矛盾。还存在着：文化事业的发展赶不上人民对文化生活的需要；文化部门对中央与地方文化事业、国营和民间文化事业、各民族之间的文化事业的统筹兼顾不够；学习外国文化知识和吸收祖国文化传统的结合不够；文化艺术领导骨干的思想业务水平和文化事业的发展不相适应等矛盾。其中，特别重要和突出的是贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”方针和干部思想中教条主义束缚的矛盾。
    会议认为：文化系统的干部目前对贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的思想情况，还是两头小，中间大：能够比较正确地体会和掌握这个方针的还只是少数人；思想上对这个方针有抵触或不重视的也是少数人；大多数人虽然原则上接受这个方针，也是逐步在思想上明确，但是由于思想上教条主义的束缚，顾虑很多，基本上还是敞不开，不敢大放。如有的人说：戏剧事业和别的事业不同，“放”“坏”了立即影响千千万万的观众，应该“谨谨慎慎地‘放’”；有的人提出：电影方面贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”，应该“力争香草、避免毒草，但也不怕毒草”；出版方面有人一提到“放”，就主观上先提出许多困难问题：“政策问题容许不容许争鸣？”“出的书有错误观点，出版社负什么责任？”会议认为，这些顾虑的实质，仍旧是怕“放”、怕“争”。
    产生这些现象和顾虑的原因，会议认为主要的是这些干部对毛主席指出的目前国内新的形势认识不足，没有把“正确地处理人民内部矛盾”、“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针放在当前整个国内形势的背景上来考虑。因此思想落后于实际，不能从新情况出发，采取新的办法来解决已经突出来的人民内部矛盾。
    会议指出：鉴于以上情况，文化部和各司、局，各协会负责人还必须把中央大放手的精神，反复地向全体干部宣传，召开干部动员会，由负责人作报告，组织全体干部再以一个月的时间认真地学习毛主席的讲话和人民日报有关社论，并把这一个学习放在一切工作之上。各单位在学习过程中，必须联系实际，解决问题。领导干部必须亲自动手，摸情况、到群众中去，采用发动党内外同志一起讨论的办法，解决本单位一、二个较突出的问题，以便在实践中更深刻地体会文件精神，积累经验，教育干部。然后再学习、再实践，使全体干部能够真正深入地领会和掌握中央的政策方针，团结一切可以团结的力量，进一步改进工作，繁荣文化艺术，满足人民群众日益增长的文化生活需要。
