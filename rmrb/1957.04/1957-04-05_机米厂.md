    A river flows by the fields,
    New embankments are built on both sides of the river,
    The cooperative's rice mill stands beside the embankment,
    The protruding chimney spews black smoke;
    The rattling of the machinery is so joyful,
    It reminds one of youthful days.
    In the morning, the sun is red and fills the sky,
    Illuminating the white walls of the factory,
    The loyal machines did not sleep last night,
    The gushing stream of water splashes white foam,
    The loyal machines never know fatigue,
    Having just milled rice and wheat,
    They are now about to quickly drain the rain-soaked water.
    Clumps of grass and trees stretch straight to the mountain peaks,
    Patches of rice seedlings fill ten thousand acres of fields,
    Everywhere, the sound of gongs and drums reverberates,
    Every family happily goes out the door,
    Every rice mill is so joyful,
    It helps village after village create a bountiful harvest.

    机米厂
    俯拾
    一条河流流过田边，
    河流的两岸新筑起堤堰，
    合作社的机米厂站在堤旁，
    突起的烟囱吐着黑烟；
    轧轧轧的机声多么欢乐，
    叫人想起青春少年。
    早上太阳红光满天，
    照亮了厂房的白墙垣，
    忠诚的机器昨晚没有睡眠，
    抽出的巨流白沫飞溅，
    忠诚的机器永远不知道疲倦，
    才碾过米、麦，
    又要把饱雨积水一下抽浅。
    一丛丛草和树直铺到山巅，
    一片片稻秧插满万顷田，
    一处处的锣鼓响喧天，
    一家家喜气出门前，
    一所所机米厂多么欢乐，
    它帮助一村村创造丰年。
