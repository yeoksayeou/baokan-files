(Comprehensive Report) According to Xinhua News Agency reports: The Sixth National Congress of the Labour Progressive Party of Canada opened in Toronto on the 19th. The agenda of this Congress includes: a report on the party's policy and the adoption of a resolution on this issue; the adoption of a new party constitution; a report on the Labour Progressive Party's program; the adoption of a draft election platform; and the election of the party's National Committee.

About four hundred delegates and guests attended the Congress, which will last for four days.

Tim Buck, General Secretary of the Labour Progressive Party of Canada, delivered a political report at the morning session on the 19th. When discussing the upcoming parliamentary elections, he said: "The main goal of our election campaign is to strengthen the unity of workers and the unity of workers and peasants in as many constituencies as possible, in order to elect as many genuine representatives of the working class as possible." The Labour Progressive Party will nominate its own candidates in various constituencies on the basis of striving for joint political action against the political representatives of monopoly capital and striving for Canada to implement a new national policy.

He called for the establishment of unbreakable fraternal ties between workers' parties of all countries based on the principles of proletarian internationalism, saying that this does not contradict the complete independence of the Labour Progressive Party of Canada.

The congress sessions were held in secret.

    加劳工进步党举行代表大会
    总书记布克号召建立各国工人政党间的兄弟联系
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：加拿大劳工进步党第六次全国代表大会19日在多伦多开幕。这次代表大会的议程是：关于党的政策的报告和通过关于这个问题的决议、通过新的党章、关于劳工进步党党纲的报告、通过选举纲领草案、选举党的全国委员会。
    参加这次代表大会的约有四百位代表和来宾。大会将举行四天。
    加拿大劳工进步党总书记蒂姆·布克在19日的上午会议上作了政治报告。他在谈到即将举行的议会选举的时候说：“我们的竞选运动的主要目标是在尽可能多的选区里加强工人的团结以及工农的团结，以便选出尽可能多的真正的工人阶级的代表。”劳工进步党将在争取反对垄断资本的政治代表的联合政治行动和争取加拿大执行新的民族政策的基础上，在各个选区里提出自己的候选人。
    他号召根据无产阶级国际主义的原则建立各国工人政党之间的牢不可破的兄弟联系，他说，这同加拿大劳工进步党的完全独立并没有矛盾。
    代表大会会议是秘密举行的。
