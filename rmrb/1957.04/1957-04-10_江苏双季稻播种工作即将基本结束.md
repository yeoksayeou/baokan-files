Jiangsu's Double-Season Rice Planting Work Nearing Completion

    (Our report) Jiangsu province's 760,000 mu of double-season rice has generally begun to be sown, and it is estimated that this work can be basically completed around the 10th of this month.

    Fast progress and good quality are the biggest characteristics of Jiangsu Province's double-season rice planting this year. In Jinshan County, the sowing of more than 3,000 mu of double-season rice seedbeds has been fully completed. Many agricultural cooperatives in Wujiang County have adopted "warm water soaking," which has advanced the seed germination period by two days compared to previous years, and the germination rate has reached over 85%. Agricultural cooperatives in Songjiang County adopted the method of "preparing the land while accelerating germination," which improved the quality of sowing and accelerated the progress of sowing.

    During sowing, the "five fixes" production responsibility system of "fixed field, fixed person, fixed labor, fixed quality, and fixed time" has been universally promoted in various places, and labor competitions have been launched. The Xinhua Agricultural Cooperative in Songjiang County divided the entire cooperative's labor force into forty-one work groups based on the farm work, labor, and technical conditions, and contracted out farm work such as seed selection, application of base fertilizer, and sowing to cooperative members, ensuring the quality of work. The entire cooperative's paddy fields were deeply ploughed to a depth of 4.5 to 5 cun, more than 1 cun deeper than last year. At the same time, agricultural cooperatives in various places have also made preparations for frost prevention in the rice paddies. Each agricultural cooperative in Lishui County prepared 70 zhang of straw curtains per mu of paddy field; in addition to preparing straw curtains, straw ropes, and cloth awnings, each agricultural cooperative in Nanhui County also formulated "frost prevention" methods to ensure good management of the paddy fields and strive for a bumper harvest of double-season rice.

    江苏双季稻播种工作即将基本结束
    本报讯　江苏省七十六万亩双季稻已普遍开始落谷，估计10日前后可以基本结束。
    进度快、质量好，这是江苏省今年种植双季稻的最大特色。金山县双季稻的三千多亩秧田，落谷工作已全部完成。吴江县的很多农业社，采用了“温汤浸种”，使种籽发芽期比往年提早两天，发芽率达到85％以上。松江县各农业社采用“边整地、边催芽”的办法，提高了播种质量，加快了落谷的进度。
    在落谷时，各地普遍推行了“定田、定人、定工、定质、定时”的生产责任制，开展了劳动竞赛。松江县新华农业社根据农活与劳动、技术情况，将全社劳力分成四十一个作业小组，并分别把选种、施基肥、落谷等农活包给社员，保证了作业质量，全社秧田深耕四寸半到五寸，比去年深耕一寸以上。与此同时，各地农业社也做好了秧田防霜准备工作。溧水县各个农业社每亩秧田准备了七十丈草帘；南汇县各个农业社除准备草帘、草绳、布篷外，还订出了“防霜”办法，保证做好秧田管理，争取双季稻大丰收。
