This newspaper reports from Chengdu on the 24th. After hearing the transmission of Chairman Mao's report, party and non-party cadres and representatives of all ethnic groups in Sichuan, combined with their actual work, are using the method of studying, examining, and improving simultaneously, taking the correct handling of contradictions among the people as a great impetus to promote work forward.

Chairman Mao's report has been widely transmitted among party and non-party cadres and representatives of all walks of life at or above the county level in various organs, factories, mines, and schools throughout the province. The Sichuan Provincial Party Committee, the Provincial People's Committee, and the Provincial Political Consultative Conference also held special meetings for discussion. The Chongqing and Chengdu Municipal Party Committees also held special enlarged meetings of the Municipal Party Committee to discuss Chairman Mao's report. In order to deeply implement the principles and policies of correctly handling contradictions among the people into all specific tasks, Sichuan Province successively convened industrial, public security, transportation, and financial and economic professional conferences in late March; and on April 19, it convened a propaganda work conference attended by the first secretaries of the prefectural and municipal party committees. Through a series of transmissions and discussions, party and non-party cadres have initially grasped the spirit of Chairman Mao's report and have begun to improve their ideological methods and work style.

In the process of learning, party committees at all levels have universally strengthened their leadership over political and ideological work. Li Jingquan, the first secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, and other secretaries and standing committee members, according to the spirit of correctly handling contradictions among the people, gave reports to major colleges and universities respectively. The secretaries of the prefectural, municipal, and county party committees throughout the province also generally gave reports to schools in their localities. The three secretaries of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee spent more than twenty days going deep into Chongqing University to investigate and understand the ideological situation of teachers and students, and extensively listened to opinions; they promptly prevented and corrected crude methods in ideological work. In order to strengthen the political education of workers, the Chengdu Municipal Party Committee universally restored the system of two hours of political education per week in each factory, lectured by the person in charge of the Party Committee. In order to effectively improve the relationship between leaders and those being led, the Municipal Party Committee's industrial conference determined that while implementing the system of factory director responsibility under the leadership of the Party Committee, it would also implement a system of mass supervision under the leadership of the Party Committee, expanding the democratic life of the factory.

Under the unified arrangement of the Provincial Party Committee, various provincial-level organs, organizations, and local party committees universally inspected the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision"; at the same time, they also held separate symposiums with various democratic parties to extensively solicit opinions. Some of the problems discovered in the inspection have been promptly resolved. Democratic parties reflected that in the past, because they could not promptly understand the party's policies and guidelines and the overall situation of the province, their activities could not be coordinated with the party's central tasks. In order to help them understand the situation, the Provincial Party Committee successively transmitted the spirit of the two enlarged meetings of the Provincial Party Committee to the democratic parties and democratic figures, and they generally felt excited and happy. Individual people who usually thought that the party kept special secrets from non-party members in terms of policy have now begun to eliminate doubts and misunderstandings. The relationship of cooperation and work with non-party members has also improved. Major meetings convened by various departments and bureaus of the Provincial People's Committee have absorbed the participation of people from the CPPCC and relevant democratic parties, and the main documents of the departments and bureaus have also been copied and sent to people from the CPPCC and relevant democratic parties.

Regarding the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," many cadres in the past had one-sided views. Subjectively, they believed that anything bad should not be "let loose" or "contended." At the same time, they underestimated the level of awareness of the masses and feared that "poisonous weeds" would affect "fragrant flowers," so they had many concerns and were tied up. In the previous period, the criticism of "grass and wood articles" in Sichuan's literary and art circles, although correct, had simple and impetuous problems in the method and attitude of criticism. On April 15, Sichuan and Chengdu's literary and art circles held a symposium to discuss the situation and problems in implementing this policy. The academic community also conducted discussions and inspections. All agreed that it is necessary to continue to "let loose" and "contend" on a large scale in the future; and to create a new socialist national culture in the "blooming" and "contending".

Many cadres believe that the spirit of "letting loose" should be expanded to the fields of social, political, and economic life, and some methods of over-managing and over-controlling should be changed.

In order to mobilize middle and primary school graduates who cannot enter higher education to participate in agricultural production, in April, each special district universally convened meetings of representatives of middle and primary school teachers, students, and parents to discuss how to correctly treat the issues of entering higher education and employment. The Sichuan Provincial Department of Education also sent out working groups to investigate the situation of rural areas needing a large number of middle and primary school graduates to return to their hometowns for production, and based on this, they conducted education for students.

In view of the fact that the study of Chairman Mao's report is not yet universal or in-depth, the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee issued a notice on April 24, instructing to suspend theoretical study and concentrate all efforts for one month to organize the transmission and study of Chairman Mao's report and related documents among all cadres.

### 边学习、边检查、开始改进工作作风  四川各级党委抓紧思想工作

    边学习、边检查、开始改进工作作风
    四川各级党委抓紧思想工作
    本报成都24日电　四川党内外干部和各族各界代表，听了毛主席报告的传达后，结合实际工作，采用边学习、边检查、边改进的方法，把正确处理人民内部矛盾作为推动工作前进的伟大动力。
    毛主席的报告已在全省各级机关、厂矿、学校相当于县级以上的党内外干部和各界代表人物中普遍进行了传达。四川省委、省人民委员会、省政协并召开专门会议进行了讨论。重庆、成都市委还特别召开了市委扩大会议，讨论毛主席的报告。为使正确处理人民内部矛盾的方针政策深入贯彻到各项具体工作中去，3月下旬，四川省先后召开了工业、公安、交通及财经专业会议；4月19日又召开了有地、市委第一书记参加的宣传工作会议。通过一系列的传达和讨论，党内外干部已初步领会了毛主席报告的精神，开始改进思想方法和工作作风。
    在学习中，各级党委普遍加强了对政治思想工作的领导。省委第一书记李井泉及其他书记、常委根据正确处理人民内部矛盾的精神，分别向各大、专学校作了报告。全省各地委、市委、县委书记，也都普遍向所在地学校作了报告。重庆市委三个书记，先后以二十多天的时间深入重庆大学调查了解教师、学生的思想情况，广泛听取意见；对于思想工作中的粗暴作法，及时加以防止和纠正。成都市委为加强职工政治教育，普遍恢复了各厂每周二小时的政治教育制度，由党委负责人亲自讲授。为有效地改善领导与被领导之间的关系，市委工业会议确定：各厂在实行党委领导下的厂长负责制的同时，实行党委领导下的群众监督制，扩大工厂民主生活。
    在省委统一布置下，省级各机关、团体和地方党委，对“长期共存、互相监督”方针普遍进行了检查；同时，还同各民主党派分别举行座谈，广泛征求意见。在检查中发现的问题，有的已及时得到解决。民主党派反映：过去因为对党的政策方针和全省情况不能及时了解，致使自己的活动不能和党的中心工作配合起来。省委为帮助他们了解情况，先后把两次省委扩大会议的精神向民主党派、民主人士进行传达，他们普遍感到兴奋愉快。个别平日总认为党对党外人士在政策上保守着特别秘密的人，现在开始消除了疑虑和误会。和党外人士的合作共事关系，也有了改进。省人民委员会各厅、局召开的重大会议，都吸收政协及有关民主党派人士参加，各厅、局的主要文件，也抄送政协及有关民主党派人士。
    对“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，过去许多干部存在着片面观点。主观上认为不好的东西，就不准“放”和“鸣”。同时，对群众觉悟程度估计不足，怕“毒草”影响“香花”，因之顾虑重重，束手束脚。前一时期，四川文艺界对“草木篇”的批评，虽然是正确的，但批评方法和态度却有简单急躁的毛病。4月15日，四川和成都市文艺界召开座谈会，讨论在贯彻执行这一方针中的情况和问题。学术界也进行了讨论和检查。一致认为今后必须继续大“放”大“鸣”；在“齐放”“争鸣”中创造社会主义的民族新文化。
    许多干部认为，应把“放”的精神扩大到社会政治经济生活领域中去，改变一些管得过多过死的办法。
    为了动员不能升学的中小学毕业生参加农业生产，4月间，各专区普遍召开中小学教师、学生、家长代表会议，讨论如何正确对待升学、就业问题。四川省教育厅并派出工作组，对农村需要大批中小学毕业生回乡生产的情况进行调查，据以向学生进行教育。
    四川省委鉴于目前对毛主席的报告学习的还不普遍、不深入，4月24日发出通知，指示暂停理论学习，用一月时间，集中全力，在全体干部中组织传达、学习毛主席的报告和有关的文件。
