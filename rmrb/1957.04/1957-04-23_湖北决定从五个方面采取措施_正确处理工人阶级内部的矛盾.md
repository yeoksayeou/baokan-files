This newspaper, Wuhan, April 22nd: The Third Industrial and Transportation Political Work Conference of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, held from April 5th to 18th, spent ten days specifically studying Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Council and other documents, and discussed how to handle contradictions within the working class.

The conference, based on the results of the discussion, decided to take measures in five aspects to correctly handle this issue. First, expand democratic life in enterprises. While implementing the factory director responsibility system under the leadership of the Party committee, implement and strengthen mass supervision under the leadership of the Party committee and improve the democratic management system. Second, strengthen political and ideological work, conduct education on the traditions of the working class, the traditions of the Chinese revolution, and diligence and thrift; for new workers from student backgrounds, also conduct labor education, so that workers not only have cultural and technical skills, but also a high degree of political consciousness. Third, through summarizing work, rectifying work style, and overcoming bureaucratic leadership. Advocate that cadres go deep into the workplace, deep into the dormitories, share weal and woe with the workers, become confidants, become familiar with the workers' labor conditions, living conditions, and ideological conditions, and strengthen the relationship between leaders and the masses. Fourth, regularly understand the workers' economic demands and living difficulties, and promptly resolve many problems that should be resolved and can be resolved; prevent neglecting concern for the lives of the masses while advocating hard work and plain living. Fifth, conscientiously study and reform irrational aspects of the wage, reward, and plan assessment systems based on the specific circumstances of the enterprise.

The New Situation of the Working Class Ranks

Before this conference, the Hubei Provincial Committee analyzed the situation in industry and transportation, believing that great achievements had been made in the past, the consciousness of the workers had been raised, and the relationship between leaders and the masses was basically normal. The Provincial Committee believes that the number of workers in the province has increased rapidly from 280,000 in 1952 to 440,000, which has certainly added new blood to the working class ranks, but because a large number of non-working class elements have transferred into the working class ranks, this has brought new and complex situations to the issue of the unity of the working class. At the same time, political work in enterprises is weak, and leading cadres still have problems with their ideological style. Therefore, how to correctly handle the issue of contradictions within the working class has become a prominent issue at present. After studying Chairman Mao's speech, the Hubei Provincial Committee summarized some past experiences and lessons in handling contradictions within the working class and listed this issue as the first topic of this industrial and transportation political work conference.

Old Ideas Cannot Adapt to the New Situation

During this discussion, cadres generally reflected that although they had read the documents in the past, their understanding was very superficial because they had not related them to their own work. When the conference guided everyone to study in connection with the situation of their own enterprises, a fierce debate unfolded. Initially, some comrades could not understand the fundamental difference between the nature of contradictions between the enemy and ourselves and contradictions among the people, as well as the issue that the two types of contradictions can transform into each other under certain conditions, and always wanted to include certain issues belonging to contradictions among the people into contradictions between the enemy and ourselves, and did not recognize that the two types of contradictions can transform into each other under certain conditions. Some comrades also said: "Speaking like this (referring to transformation) will relax our vigilance against the enemy." During the debate, everyone analyzed the historical experience of the Party and the current situation, and only then did they have a clear understanding of this issue, and further realized that their old ideas and old work styles were not adapted to the new situation and must be quickly transformed.

Isn't it due to Bureaucracy?

What is the reason why some contradictions among the people that are more prominent cannot be resolved in a timely manner? Initially, a few comrades believed that it was not due to bureaucracy, but due to the non-working class ideology among the masses. They were afraid that saying it was bureaucracy would make leading cadres shrink back and not dare to lead. However, most comrades disagreed with this view. Everyone presented the situation and collected materials, and even a few things unrelated to the bureaucracy of the leadership could not be found. In particular, some mass-based contradictions among the people are inseparable from the bureaucracy and erroneous ideas of the leadership.

We Shouldn't Linger Over the "Suppression" Method

Regarding what method to use to resolve contradictions among the people, although everyone agreed with the "unity—criticism—unity" method from the beginning, when it came to specific issues, many people still defended the "suppression" method and lingered over some simple and crude methods. The conference took the inappropriate handling of a few young workers in the Wuhan Automobile Parts Factory in the past as a typical example for analysis, specifically explaining that if the method of persuasion and education is not adopted to correctly handle contradictions among the people, the contradiction will become more acute and the problem will be more difficult to solve.

Cadres in some small towns and township factories believed that the issue of contradictions within the working class was a matter for large factories, "Our factory is small, things are simple, we don't have these problems." After specific analysis, it was found that the problems in these small factories were also relatively prominent, and only then did they concentrate their efforts on studying. When analyzing bureaucracy, some cadres emphasized that this was all caused by the bureaucracy of higher-level leading organs, as if they had no responsibility. After specific analysis, everyone also clarified that "each has their own account," and began to earnestly examine themselves.

    湖北决定从五个方面采取措施  正确处理工人阶级内部的矛盾
    本报武汉22日电　在4月5日至18日举行的中共湖北省委第三次工业交通政治工作会议，专门用十天时间学习毛主席在最高国务会议上的讲话和其他文件，讨论了怎样处理工人阶级内部矛盾的问题。
    会议根据讨论的结果，决定从五个方面采取措施来正确处理这个问题。一、扩大企业的民主生活。在实行党委领导下的厂长负责制的同时，实行和加强党委领导下的群众监督，健全民主管理制度。二、加强政治思想工作，对工人进行工人阶级传统、中国革命传统和勤劳俭朴的教育；对学生出身的新工人，还要进行劳动教育，使工人不仅具有文化技术水平，还具有高度的政治觉悟。三、通过总结工作，整顿作风，克服领导的官僚主义。提倡干部深入现场，深入宿舍，和工人同甘共苦，结成知心朋友，熟悉工人的劳动状况、生活状况和思想状况，密切领导与群众的关系。四、经常了解工人的经济要求和生活困难，对许多应当解决而又可能解决的问题，及时解决；防止在提倡艰苦朴素的同时，又忽视了关心群众生活。五、对工资、奖励、计划考核等制度中不合理的地方，根据本企业情况认真研究，予以改革。
    工人队伍的新情况
    在这次会议之前，湖北省委分析了工业交通方面的情况，认为过去工作的成绩很大，工人的觉悟有了提高，领导与群众的关系基本正常。省委认为：全省工人由1952年的二十八万人增加到四十四万人，发展很迅速，这固然给工人队伍增加了新的血液，但因为大批非工人阶级的成份转到了工人阶级队伍中，给工人阶级的团结问题带来了新的复杂的情况。同时，企业政治工作薄弱，领导干部思想作风上还有毛病。因此，怎样正确处理工人阶级内部矛盾问题，便成了当前突出的问题。湖北省委在学习毛主席的讲话后，总结了过去处理工人阶级内部矛盾问题的若干经验教训，并将这个问题列为这次工业交通政治工作会议的第一个议题。
    旧思想不能适应新形势
    在这次讨论中，干部们普遍反映过去虽然也读了文件，但因为没有同自己的工作联系起来，认识很肤浅。当会议引导大家联系本企业情况进行学习的时候，就展开了激烈的争论。对敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾的根本性质的区别，以及两种矛盾在一定条件下可以互相转化的问题，最初，有的同志想不通，总想把某些属于人民内部矛盾的问题列入敌我矛盾中，并且不承认两种矛盾在一定条件下可以转化。有的同志还讲：“这样一讲（指转化），会放松了对敌人的警惕性。”在争论中，大家分析了党的历史经验和当前形势，才对这个问题有了清楚的认识，并进一步体会到自己的旧思想、旧作风与新形势不相适应，必须迅速转变。
    不是由于官僚主义吗？
    对有些人民内部矛盾问题比较突出而不能及时解决的原因何在？最初也有少数同志认为不是由于官僚主义，而是由于群众中的非工人阶级思想。他们怕说是官僚主义，会使领导干部缩手缩脚，不敢领导。但大多数同志不同意这个意见。大家摆情况、凑材料，就算不出几件与领导上官僚主义无关的事。特别是一些带有群众性的人民内部矛盾问题，都是跟领导上的官僚主义和错误思想分不开的。
    不应留恋“压服”方法
    对用什么方法解决人民内部矛盾问题，虽然大家一开始就赞成用“团结—批评—团结”的方法，但一涉及到具体问题的时候，仍有不少人为“压服”的方法辩护，留恋某些简单粗暴的方法。会议以武汉汽车配件厂过去处理少数青年工人问题不当的事例为典型进行了分析，具体说明了如果不采取说服教育的方法来正确处理人民内部矛盾问题，反而会使矛盾更尖锐，问题更难解决。
    有些城镇小厂的干部认为工人阶级内部矛盾问题是大厂的事，“我们厂子小，事情简单，没这些问题”。经过具体分析，查出了这些小厂存在的问题也比较突出，他们才集中了精力进行学习。有些干部在分析官僚主义的时候，强调这都是上级领导机关的官僚主义造成的，好像自己没有责任。经过具体分析，大家也明确了“各有各的账”，开始认真检查自己。
