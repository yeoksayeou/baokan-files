Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 9th. Shanghai will build, expand, and renovate more than twenty light industry factories this year, and add some factory buildings and equipment to more than one hundred existing light industry factories.

It is understood from the six light industry leadership departments in Shanghai that this year's total investment in basic construction of Shanghai's light industry will increase by more than 27% compared with last year, which is the year with the most state investment in Shanghai's light industry in the past five years.

This year's investment in Shanghai's light industry is mainly used to increase products that are most closely related to people's lives. Shanghai will build a relatively modern watch factory this year. After completion, it can produce 300 seventeen-jewel three-hand watches every day. The Shanghai Glass Instrument Factory, which will be newly built this year, will mass-produce various important glass instruments needed for scientific research and school teaching. In addition, a number of factories producing medicines, rubber shoes, enamelware, paper, saccharin, celluloid products, etc. will also be appropriately expanded this year. After the expansion of the Dafu Rubber Factory is completed, the annual output of "Dahu" brand rubber shoes will increase from more than 2 million pairs before the expansion to 5 million pairs. Shanghai No. 3 Pharmaceutical Factory is undergoing its fourth expansion since its establishment; after this expansion is completed, it will mass-produce a new antibiotic – chlortetracycline.

A considerable part of this year's investment in basic construction is also used to renovate many small-scale factories. These factories have great production potential. After investing a small amount in certain weak links this year, production can be rapidly increased. The Scientific Chemical Factory, which produces thermometers, has not been able to quickly increase the output of thermometers in the past due to the small factory area. This year, the factory decided to add some simple factory buildings with low construction costs, and the thermometer output can be increased by about 100%.

Improving the working conditions and welfare of employees is still a very important project in this year's basic construction. A new type of paper-making raw material processing plant will appear in the suburbs of Shanghai this year. After it is completed in the third quarter, all kinds of dirty waste cloth raw materials used by paper mills in the city will first be concentrated here for dust removal and disinfection using closed methods, so that workers who dismantle waste cloth will not have to operate in a dusty environment. The tobacco industry and the paper industry are also preparing to build more than 30,000 square meters of staff dormitories this year. A number of factories will also add some canteens and bathrooms.

    上海增加轻工业建设投资
    准备大量生产金霉素、手表和玻璃仪器等产品
    新华社上海9日电　上海今年将新建、扩建和改建二十多个轻工业工厂，并且在一百多个原有轻工业工厂里增添一些厂房和设备。
    据从上海六个轻工业领导部门了解：今年上海轻工业的全部基本建设投资，比去年增加27％以上，是最近五年内国家对上海轻工业投资最多的一年。
    今年上海轻工业的投资，主要是用来增加同人民生活关系最密切的产品。上海今年将新建一个比较现代化的手表厂，建成以后，每天可以出产三百只长三针十七占手表。将在今年新建的上海玻璃仪器厂，将大量生产科学研究和学校教学需要的各种重要的玻璃仪器。另外还有一批生产药品、胶鞋、搪瓷、纸张、糖精、赛璐珞制品等产品的工厂，也要在今年进行适当的扩建。大孚橡胶厂扩建完工以后，“大虎”牌胶鞋的年产量将从扩建前的二百几十万双提高到五百万双。上海第三制药厂正在进行建厂以来的第四次扩建；这次扩建完成以后，将大量生产一种新的抗生素——金霉素。
    今年的基本建设投资还有不少是用来改造许多规模不大的工厂。这些工厂蕴藏的生产潜力很大，今年在某些薄弱环节上花很少的投资以后，就可以迅速增加生产。生产体温计的科学化工厂，过去由于厂房面积狭小，体温计的产量不能很快提高，今年这个厂决定增添一些造价较低的简单厂房，体温计产量就可以提高一倍左右。
    改善职工劳动条件和生活福利，在今年的基本建设中仍然是一个很重要的项目。今年上海市郊将出现的一座新型的造纸原料加工厂，在第三季度建成以后，全市造纸厂用的各种肮脏不堪的破布原料，都先要集中在这里采用密闭方法进行除尘和消毒处理，检拆破布的工人就不要在灰尘乱飞的环境里操作了。烟草工业和造纸工业部门今年还准备建造三万多平方公尺的职工宿舍。还有一批工厂要增添一些食堂和浴室。
