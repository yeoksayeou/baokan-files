Xinhua News Agency, New York, 11th: According to a TASS report from New York on the 10th, Brigadier General Rothschild, head of the Scientific Research Division of the U.S. Army Chemical Corps, said in a speech in New York on April 9th that improvements in nuclear weapons have not made chemical and biological weapons "obsolete," and the United States cannot consider that poison warfare is outdated.

Rothschild admitted that the American chemical industry has greatly expanded military production recently. He said that by the summer of 1957, the United States would have 350 scientific research institutes and industrial laboratories serving the needs of the Army Chemical Corps. According to Rothschild, in the future, three thousand research laboratories in industrial enterprises will be engaged in the manufacture of new chemical and biological weapons.
