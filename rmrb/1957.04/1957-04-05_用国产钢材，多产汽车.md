    Use Domestic Steel to Produce More Cars
    By our reporter Chen Ji
    It has been almost five months since the First Automobile Works officially went into production. Every day, when we see "Liberation" brand cars, inlaid with silver, driving out of the final assembly workshop, our hearts are thrilled. However, when we hear that we cannot produce more cars due to a shortage of steel, our hearts feel heavy. Many people who care about the development of our country's automobile industry often ask anxiously: "Can the automobile factory use domestic steel? Can we use less steel and produce more cars?"...
    We know that manufacturing cars requires hundreds of technically complex types of steel. Our country's existing metallurgical plants cannot supply all of them yet. In terms of steel types, the First Automobile Works used only about one-third domestic steel last year. Most of the steel was imported from abroad. Relying on imports not only costs a lot of foreign exchange, but also makes it difficult to ensure mass, continuous production due to long distances and inconvenient transportation. All the staff of the First Automobile Works are on tenterhooks all day long, fearing the interruption of steel supply. After officially going into production, the production efficiency improved rapidly, but because of the shortage of steel supply, not many cars are produced every day. To overcome this difficulty, the only way out is to use domestic steel in large quantities and try to use less steel.
    According to the instructions of the First Ministry of Machine Building, the Party organization and administrative departments of the First Automobile Works have tried every means to use more domestic steel and save steel. At present, a technical conclusion has been reached: in terms of steel types, we can strive to have 87% of the steel supplied domestically. At the same time, by further modifying some designs, it is possible to strive to have more than 90% of the steel supplied domestically. If this possibility becomes a reality, the First Automobile Works can basically use domestic steel and produce more cars.
    This is an exciting piece of news.
    The question now is: can it be realized? How can it be realized?
    Let's start with the issue of modifying the design. The Liberation brand car is basically the same as the Soviet ZIS-150 car. This car is sturdy and durable. However, it is not without defects. For example, its large weight and high steel consumption are among its defects. A Liberation brand car requires more than 3,900 kilograms of metal materials. The performance of some parts is not entirely suitable for the needs of Chinese roads. For example, insufficient heat dissipation and a stuffy driver's cab; the cargo box is not large enough; the carburetor's acceleration performance is not good enough, etc. Therefore, it is necessary to appropriately improve this car. How to improve it?
    In the past, some people aimed too high, considering what the best new model would be while disregarding economic benefits and realistic possibilities. They yearned for the emergence of a latest model. However, to develop a new model, the automobile factory needs to replace a lot of equipment, which is very uneconomical and cannot be done. The current problem in our country is not to rush to develop the latest model, but to quickly overcome the steel shortage and produce more cars. Our country's existing automobile design force is very small, and it is also impossible to quickly design a latest model that is completely suitable for China's needs. Therefore, the First Automobile Works criticized the design ideas that were divorced from reality, and demanded that, on the basis of using the Liberation brand car model, some designs should be gradually modified in order to reduce the weight of the car body, use domestic steel and substitute materials, and improve the performance of some parts to make them suitable for China's needs.
    The designers of the First Automobile Works began to study and review the design of automobile parts, and found many ways to overcome the steel shortage. The first way is to cancel some automobile parts. Doing so saves steel and does not affect the performance of the car. For example, several mudguards for the front and rear tires of the car can be removed. The second way is to replace steel with non-metallic materials. For example, the stamped parts under the car seats can be changed to wood. The parts inside the steel windows can also be made of wood. The third way is to reduce the thickness and weight of materials. For example, the bumper in front of the car is six millimeters thick and can be reduced to four millimeters. The fourth way is to replace imported steel with domestic steel. This method is the most important. For example, many components of the car body are stamped from cold-rolled steel. Our country cannot manufacture these cold-rolled steel. Therefore, it is very important to replace cold-rolled steel with hot-rolled steel that our country can manufacture. It has now been decided to change the car's wings and the front of the car's radiator grille to hot-rolled steel. According to incomplete statistics, using the above four methods can reduce the amount of steel used to manufacture a car by about 50 kilograms, and it can also replace cold-rolled steel with hot-rolled steel, reducing 40 to 50 kilograms of imported steel. This improvement is just the beginning. If further research is conducted, it may be possible to use less imported steel and produce more cars. It is now being considered whether the foot pedals at the car doors can be changed to wooden boards? Can the gasoline tank, which weighs 140 to 150 kilograms, be lightened? The First Automobile Works also has a plan to make some canvas-covered driver's cabs. This type of cab can save a lot of steel plates. It is also very convenient to use. However, there is a disadvantage: it is not warm in winter and not cool in summer. Can this shortcoming be overcome? Such issues still need the opinions of transportation departments and other car-using units for joint research. According to the opinions of the transportation department, the First Automobile Works is preparing to design a car without a driver's cab. This car can be converted into a bus, or it can be converted into a truck with a different type of cab. Some automobile repair shops in the transportation department can use this car to convert it into a car that meets their needs. Shanghai Transportation Company has decided to use this car to convert it into a bus. The realization of these plans still requires the help and cooperation of all parties.
    At present, steel supplied domestically accounts for 54% of the steel types needed for automobiles. To strive for 87% of domestic steel, we still need to think of more ways. Due to equipment difficulties, our country's steel mills cannot resolve the contradiction between variety and quantity. The new types of steel required for producing automobiles are indeed much more difficult to produce than other ordinary steel. Therefore, some steel mills are afraid of accepting the tasks of the First Automobile Works. This problem has not been resolved yet. If this problem is resolved, the steel needed for automobiles can be basically supplied domestically.
    The issue of using steel is related to the speed of national industrialization. How to try every means to use less steel is still a major task for the First Automobile Works in the future. Some production workshops, such as forging workshops and stamping workshops, have begun to use steel rationally and have been able to save a lot of funds. However, some production workshops have a lot of rejects and a lot of waste materials, and the waste is also not small. If the production workshops vigorously overcome waste, it is also a way to reduce the steel shortage. At the same time, it is necessary to further strengthen design work and supply work. At present, most of the design work stays on paper and is not well integrated with the production work. If the designers go deeper into actual production, they can find more and better ways to save steel. The supply work is not very active. There is not much research into the situation of domestic materials. Some people say that there are many small factories in Shanghai that can produce some steel strips for the First Automobile Works. Unfortunately, these small factories have not been found for cooperation in the past. It is still necessary to make efforts to open up the sources of domestic steel.

    用国产钢材，多产汽车
    本报记者　陈迹
    第一汽车制造厂正式投入生产快五个多月了。每天当我们看见一辆辆镶着白银色“解放”字样的汽车开出总装配车间的时候，我们的心情是激动的。但是，当我们又听说因为钢材不足而不能多出汽车的时候，我们的心里就像压上一块石头。许多关心祖国汽车工业发展的人们，常常焦急地问道：“汽车厂能不能采用国产钢材？能不能少用些钢材、多出些汽车？”……
    我们知道：制造汽车，需要好几百种技术复杂的钢材。我国现有的冶金工厂还不能全部供应。从钢材的品种来说，去年第一汽车厂采用的国产钢材，只占全部钢材品种的三分之一左右。大部分钢材是依靠国外进口的。依靠国外进口，不但要耗费大量外汇，而且因为路途遥远、运输不便，很难保证大量流水生产。第一汽车厂全体职工，一天到晚，提心吊胆，怕钢材供应的中断。正式投入生产以后，生产效率提高很快，但是因为钢材供应不足，每天出产的汽车却不多。要战胜这种困难，唯一的出路就是大量采用国产钢材，尽量少用钢材。
    第一汽车厂党组织和行政部门，根据第一机械工业部的指示，想尽各种办法，争取多采用国产钢材，并且努力节省钢材。目前在技术上已经作出结论：在钢材品种方面，可以争取87％的钢材，由国内供应。同时，再修改一些设计，还可能争取90％以上的钢材都由国内供应。如果把这种可能变成现实，第一汽车厂就可以基本上采用国产钢材，多制造出些汽车来。
    这是一个振奋人心的消息。
    现在的问题是：能不能实现呢？怎样实现呢？
    先从修改设计的问题说起。解放牌汽车，基本上是同苏联吉斯一五○型汽车差不多的。这种汽车，坚固耐用。但是，它不是没有缺陷的。例如自身重量大，耗费的钢材多，就是缺陷之一。一辆解放牌汽车，需要三千九百多公斤金属材料。有些部件的性能，还不完全适合中国道路的需要。例如：散热能力不足，驾驶室闷热；车箱容量不大；化油器加速性能不够好等等。因之，对于这种汽车，适当地加以改进是必要的。怎样改进呢？
    过去，有些人好高骛远，离开经济效果和现实的可能性，来考虑什么是最好的新车型。他们向往着一种最新车型的出现。但是，要搞个新车型，汽车厂有不少的设备需要更换，这是很不经济的，是不能这样做的。我国目前的问题，还不是急忙搞最新车型的问题，而是赶快战胜钢材困难，多出汽车。我国现有的汽车设计力量很小，也不可能很快设计出完全适合中国需要的最新车型。因此，第一汽车厂批判了脱离实际的设计思想，要求在利用解放牌汽车这种车型的基础上，逐步地修改一些设计，以便减轻车身的重量，采用国产钢材和代用材料，并且改进一些部件的性能，使其适合中国的需要。
    第一汽车厂设计人员开始研究和审查了汽车零件的设计，就发现了许多战胜钢材困难的办法。第一种办法是：取消一些汽车零件。这样做，既节省钢材，又不影响汽车的性能。例如：汽车前后轮胎的挡泥板，就可以取消几块。第二种办法是：用非金属材料代替钢材。例如：汽车坐垫下面的冲压零件可以改用木料的。钢窗里面的零件，也可以用木料的。第三种办法是：减少材料的厚度和重量。例如：车头前面的保险杠，有六公厘厚，可以减至四公厘。第四种办法是：用国产钢材，代替进口钢材。这个办法最重要。例如：车身的许多组成部分，都是用冷轧钢材冲压出来的。这些冷轧钢材，我国都不能制造。因此，用我国能够制造的热轧钢材，来代替冷轧钢材，就十分重要了。现在已经决定：把汽车两翼翅膀和车头前面的水箱罩，都改为热轧钢材。根据不完全的统计：采用上述四种办法，制造一辆汽车，就可以少用五十公斤左右的钢材，并且还可以用热轧钢材代替冷轧钢材，减少四、五十公斤进口钢材。这种改进，还只是开始。如果进一步研究，还可能少用些进口钢材，多出些汽车。现在正在考虑：汽车门口的脚踏板，能不能改成木板的？重达一百四、五十公斤的汽油箱，能不能减轻一些？第一汽车厂还有个计划，就是做一些帆布篷的驾驶室。这种驾驶室，可以大量节省钢板。使用起来，又很方便。不过，有个缺点，就是冬不保暖、夏不防热。这个缺点，能不能克服？诸如此类的问题，还需要交通运输部门和其他使用汽车的单位提出意见，共同研究。第一汽车厂已经根据交通运输部门的意见，准备设计出一种不装驾驶室的汽车。这种汽车，可以改成公共汽车，也可以改装成别种驾驶车的卡车。交通运输部门有些汽车修理厂，能够利用这种汽车，改装成适合自己需要的汽车。上海交通公司已经决定，准备用这种汽车，改装公共汽车。实现这些计划，还需要各方面的帮助和配合。
    目前，由国内供应的钢材，已占汽车需要的钢材品种的54％。要争取87％的国产钢材，还需要多想些办法。我国钢铁厂因为设备方面的困难，还不能解决品种和数量的矛盾。生产汽车所需要的新品种钢材，确实要比生产别的普通钢材困难得多。因此，有些钢铁厂害怕接受了第一汽车厂的任务。这个问题，现在还未解决。解决了这个问题，汽车所需要的钢材，是可以基本上由国内供应的。
    使用钢材的问题，是关系着国家工业化速度的问题。如何想尽办法，少使用些钢材，仍然是第一汽车厂今后的重大任务。有些生产车间，例如：锻工车间和冲压车间，开始合理使用钢材，已能节省大量资金。但是，有些生产车间，废品多，废料多，浪费也不小。如果生产车间大力克服浪费现象，也是减少钢材困难的一个途径。同时，要进一步加强设计工作和供应工作。现在设计工作多停留在纸面上，没有很好地跟生产工作结合起来。设计人员如果多深入到实际生产中去，还能够找到更多更好的节省钢材的办法。供应工作，还不很主动。对于国内材料的情况，研究不深。有人说，上海有许多小工厂，可以为第一汽车厂生产一些钢带。可惜的是过去没有去找这些小工厂进行协作。努力开辟国内钢材的来源，还是很必要的。
