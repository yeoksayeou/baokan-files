    Big Fishnet-ism
    Sun Yuanfan
    There was a big fishnet incident reported in the newspaper. A department head of the Taishan County Committee in Guangdong Province, disregarding the advice of others, forced fishermen to abandon all their small fishnets and make a giant fishnet weighing over 30,000 jin, hoping to catch all the fish schools passing through the sea in one swoop. As a result, the big fishnet caught nothing. The comrade's intentions were certainly good; he originally believed that big fishnets had many advantages: large, concentrated, convenient, and efficient, capable of solving big problems. Indeed, some people in life like to do big things, are keen on solving big problems, and are eager to solve problems thoroughly in one go. Some even elevate this to a theoretical level, saying that this "big" addiction is a key-point-ism spirit for solving problems.
    There may be even bigger fishnets in the world than the one weighing over 30,000 jin. But the common sense of Marxism is that everything must be considered in terms of time, place, and conditions. The buildings of Moscow University are indeed large and appropriate for today's Soviet Union. However, if this large building were moved to Beijing today, it would be inappropriate; not to mention the elevators alone, the Beijing Power Supply Bureau would have objections. Look at the newly built buildings in Beijing; upon entering the main gate, there are two rows of elevators on the left and right, but only one or two are in operation. A notice is posted: elevators are for foreign guests and experts; personnel of this organization are requested to walk up to the first, second, third, and fourth floors themselves. Chongqing has a famous Tiantan Auditorium, which can accommodate six or seven thousand people (with palace-style guest houses on both wings that are not suitable for living), but it is unknown how many times a year it is "full."
    There are indeed big fishnets in life. There are even more planners of big fishnets.
    It is said that there is a river where many reservoirs have already been built on the tributaries to contain floods in order to solve the flood control problem, but the problem has not been solved much. Therefore, there is now a new plan: to build the largest reservoir on the main stream to thoroughly solve the flood control problem. But what is the cost of this large reservoir? More than one million people will be relocated, and the investment will be tens of billions of yuan.
    It is also said that there is a river where no reservoirs have yet been built on the tributaries for flood control purposes, and now there is a plan to build the largest reservoir on the main stream to contain floods. But what is the cost? In one province, "mulberry fields" will return to the "ocean," a city with a population of one million people will have to move, and the project itself will cost tens of billions of yuan.
    Big fishnets cannot be opposed across the board. What is important is to distinguish between "thinking" and "doing," and to consider when and how to use them. The newspaper reported news: Someone in the Soviet Union is studying the possibility of digging a tunnel through the Himalayas, so that trains can run between China and India. An agency received a letter from a foreign engineer who was very interested in the hydropower station at the bend of the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet (so large that it can generate 50 million kilowatts of electricity) and was willing to help build it. We also have people studying how to open a canal from the Northeast all the way to Guangzhou, and how to divert water from the Yangtze River to the Yellow River. Fantasy is necessary in life, and fantasy promotes life. Thirty-six years ago, when the Chinese Communist Party was founded, it had only a few dozen members, and it set the goal of overthrowing imperialism and feudalism and establishing a new China. Was this not a great fantasy at the time? But without this fantasy, it would not be the Chinese Communist Party. The question is how to do it, how to realize this fantasy. History has already answered that the new China cannot be established using the Chen Duxiu line, the Li Lisan line, or the Wang Ming line. Now, if scientists, writers, and poets put forward certain great fantasies, that is of course possible and necessary. However, if thousands of cadres in an agency put aside all realistic problems and even their own urgent business, and instead invite dozens of experts to plan how to dig a tunnel through the Himalayas, how to travel by boat from Shenyang to Guangzhou, what humanity will be like fifty years from now, etc., then there is no way to name it, except to call it: Big Fishnet-ism. Unfortunately, there seem to be such agencies now. Our newspapers and reporters (including the People's Daily) sometimes also like to promote big fishnets, and are even more enthusiastic than criticizing the big fishnet in Taishan: adding frills, publishing on the front page, even the front page headline.
    This short article may cause some small storms. Some comrades may raise objections or even protests to the "specific problems" in the examples that are not spelled out. But I declare in advance: discussing specific issues requires long articles and experts to solve them; this short essay is just a short essay expressing some miscellaneous feelings.

    大鱼网主义
    孙元范
    报上登过一个大鱼网事件。广东台山县县委一位部长不相信别人的劝告，强迫渔民取消所有的小鱼网，做了一个三万多斤重的大鱼网，想把过海的鱼群一网打尽。结果，大鱼网打不上鱼来。这位同志的心意当然是好的，他本来认为大鱼网好处多：大、集中，方便，效率高，能解决大问题。生活中确实有人喜欢办大事情，热中于解决大问题，急于一次彻底解决问题；还有人把这提到理论的高度，说这种“大”癖是解决问题的重点主义精神。
    世界上可能有比三万多斤更大的大鱼网。但是马克思主义的常识是：一切要看时间、地点和条件。莫斯科大学的建筑实在可谓大的，对于今天的苏联是恰当的。可是，这大房子如果今天搬到北京来，就是不恰当的；别的不说，单是电梯就受不了：北京电业局会有意见。请看北京新盖的大楼，一进大门，左右两排电梯，然而开动的只有一个、两个；并贴有布告：电梯供外宾和专家用，本机关人员一、二、三、四层仍请自己走上去。重庆有座出名的天坛大礼堂，能容六七千人（两翼还有宫殿式的不宜于住人的招待所），但不知一年有几次“客满”。
    生活中确实是有大鱼网的。有大鱼网的计划者就更多。
    据说，有一条河流，为了解决防洪问题，在支流上已经修了许多水库来装洪水，然而解决问题不大。于是现在有新的规划：在干流上修一个最大的水库，以彻底解决防洪问题。可是这个大水库的代价是多大呢？移民一百万人以上，投资好几十亿元。
    据说，还有一条河流，也是为了解决防洪问题，支流上还没有为此修过水库，现在计划在干流上修一个最大的水库来装洪水。可是代价多大呢？有一个省，“桑田”要回到“沧海”，有一个一百几十万人口的城市要搬家，工程本身要花一百几十亿元。
    大鱼网是不能一概反对的，重要的是要区别“想”和“做”，看什么时候，用什么办法。报上登过新闻：苏联有人研究，从喜马拉雅山打一条隧洞，中国同印度可以通火车。有个机关接到过外国工程师的来信，对西藏雅鲁藏布江河弯处的水电站（大到能发五千万瓩电）很有兴趣，愿意来帮助修建。我们也有人在研究如何从东北开运河一直通到广州，如何把长江的水引到黄河去。生活中是必须有幻想的，幻想对生活起促进作用。三十六年前，中国共产党成立时，只有几十个党员，就立下打倒帝国主义封建主义、建立新中国的目标，这在当时何尝不是大幻想；但没有这种幻想就不成其为中国共产党。问题在如何做，如何实现这个幻想。历史已经回答不能用陈独秀路线、立三路线或王明路线来建立新中国。现在如果有科学家、作家、诗人提出某些大幻想，那当然是可以的，也是需要的。然而，如果一个机关的几千干部，把现实问题乃至本身迫切业务一概放下不管，却请来几十位专家，专门来计划如何打通喜马拉雅山的隧洞，如何从沈阳坐船到广州，人类五十年以后将如何，等等，那就无以名之，只能名之曰：大鱼网主义。遗憾的是，现在似乎真有这样的机关；我们的报纸和记者（包括人民日报）有时也颇喜欢宣传大鱼网，而且比批判台山那个大鱼网还起劲：加花边，登头版，甚至头版头条。
    这篇小文章可能引起一些小风波；对没讲穿的例子中的“具体问题”，可能有同志会提出异议乃至抗议。但笔者预先声明：谈到具体问题，那是需要大文章和专家们才能解决的，我这篇短文不过是一篇谈点杂感的小杂文而已。
