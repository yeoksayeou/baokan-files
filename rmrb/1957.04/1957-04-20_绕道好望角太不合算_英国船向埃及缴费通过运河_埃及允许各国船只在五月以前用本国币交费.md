Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Suez Canal Authority announced on the evening of the 18th that two British ships had paid the Suez Canal Authority passage fees, and they would therefore be allowed to pass through the canal.

This is the first time British ships have paid transit fees to the Egyptian authorities since the Suez Canal reopened.

The "West Wind," one of the first two British ships to pass through the canal since its reopening, entered the canal from Port Suez on the 18th. The other British ship, "White Ash," is scheduled to arrive at Port Suez today.

On the same day, the British Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation, Watkinson, said in the House of Commons that the British government wanted British shipowners to continue to avoid using the canal until the Suez Canal issue was clarified. He also said that British shipowners were heeding this advice.

However, according to Western news agencies, some British shipping companies are putting pressure on the government, demanding to use the canal under Egyptian conditions with reservations, in order to cope with increasingly fierce foreign competition. Some newspapers have also made similar requests.

Xinhua News Agency, April 19th dispatch from Port Said: The Egyptian Suez Canal Authority announced on April 18th that it would temporarily allow ships of all countries to pay canal passage fees in their national currency. This temporary payment method will be implemented until the end of April, so that shipowners have sufficient time to adapt to the new regulations for payment in designated currencies, which will be implemented from May 1st.

Among the designated currencies, the U.S. dollar, Canadian dollar, and Swiss franc can be used by ships of all countries. The Indian rupee is limited to use by Indian ships. The currencies of certain Western European and Northern European countries (excluding the British pound and the French franc) are also limited to the ships of the countries using these currencies.

    绕道好望角太不合算
    英国船向埃及缴费通过运河
    埃及允许各国船只在五月以前用本国币交费
    据新华社讯　苏伊士运河管理局18日晚宣布两艘英国船只已经把通行费交给埃及苏伊士运河管理局，因此将准许它们通过运河。
    这是苏伊士运河恢复通航以来，英国船只第一次把运河通航费付给埃及当局。
    自从运河重新开放以来首次通过运河的两艘英国船只之一的“西和风号”已在18日从苏伊士港进入运河。另一艘英国船“白杨山号”预定在今天到达苏伊士港。
    就在同一天，英国交通和民用航空大臣沃金森在下院说，在苏伊士运河问题明确以前，英国政府要英国船主继续避免使用运河。他还说，英国船主是听从这个劝告的。
    但是，据西方通讯社报道，英国的一些航运公司正对政府施行压力，它们要求有保留地根据埃及的条件使用运河，以应付日益剧烈的外国的竞争。还有一些报纸也提出了类似的要求。
    据新华社19日讯　塞得港消息，埃及苏伊士运河管理局4月18日宣布，暂时允许各国船只用本国货币交付运河通行费。这一临时付款办法将实行到4月底，以便船主有充分的时间来适应将从5月1日起施行的以指定货币付款的新规定。
    在指定的货币中，美元、加拿大元和瑞士法郎所有各国船只都可使用。印度卢比限印度船只使用。某些西欧和北欧国家的货币（不包括英镑和法国的法郎）也只限这些货币的使用国的船只使用。
