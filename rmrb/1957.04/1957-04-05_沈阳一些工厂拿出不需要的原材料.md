Some Factories in Shenyang Contribute Unneeded Raw Materials

    (Our dispatch) Shenyang has some factories that are taking out unneeded raw materials to support brother factories. The Shenyang Electrical Manufacturing Plant handed over more than 50 tons of metal materials that the plant did not need to the higher-level unit for balancing. Among the raw materials handed over, some were materials blindly purchased when material supply was tight. After careful accounting, it was decided to hand them all over. Shenyang General Machinery Factory recently inventoried its inventory of materials and took out more than 30 tons of rock steel, manganese steel, electro-galvanized zinc, refined copper, etc., which are currently not in use, to support brother factories. Shenyang Low-Voltage Switch Factory opened its warehouse and inventoried more than 240 tons of surplus iron plates, round steel, etc., and more than 100,000 meters of rubber wire. At present, this factory is actively disposing of surplus materials, and more than 40 tons of steel and other materials used to support brother factories have already been made available. This factory will process 1.83 million yuan of surplus materials before the fourth quarter of this year to meet the national storage limit.

    沈阳一些工厂拿出不需要的原材料
    本报讯　沈阳有一些工厂把自己不需要的原材料拿出来支援兄弟工厂。沈阳电器制造厂将本厂不用的金属材料五十多吨交给上级单位平衡。交出的原材料中，有些是在材料供应紧张时盲目采购的材料，经过算细账后都决定交出来。沈阳通用机器厂最近清点了库存材料，将目前不用的岩钢、锰钢、电锌、精铜等三十多吨拿出来支援兄弟工厂。沈阳低压开关厂打开仓库清查出多余的铁板、元钢等二百四十吨，橡皮线十万多公尺。目前这个厂正在积极处理多余物资，用作支援兄弟厂的钢铁等材料已经有四十多吨。这个厂要在今年第四季度前处理完一百八十三万元的多余材料，以达到国家规定的储存限额。
