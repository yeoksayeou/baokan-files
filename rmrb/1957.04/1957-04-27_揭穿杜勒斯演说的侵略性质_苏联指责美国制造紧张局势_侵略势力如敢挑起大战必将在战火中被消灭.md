Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 26th: TASS issued a statement on the 25th, saying that U.S. Secretary of State Dulles' speech at the Associated Press annual meeting on April 22nd, regarding what he called "several basic concepts that determine (U.S.) foreign policy," once again shows that we must be vigilant and constantly on guard against the conspiracies of the enemies of peace, the enemies of freedom, and the independence of all nations.

The statement, which was widely published in Moscow newspapers today, said that the main content of Dulles' speech was not to seek ways to ease international tensions. Given that he claimed his unpretentious speech was a programmatic statement clarifying the principles of current U.S. foreign policy, Soviet leaders issued a statement saying that the blatant aggressive nature of Dulles' speech cannot but draw attention. Obviously, he has chosen the path of adventure and war in foreign policy. Dulles made no mention of peaceful coexistence, but instead focused on the so-called "liberation" policy, hoping to restore the power of landlords and capitalists in socialist countries through this policy.

However, according to Dulles' logic, the Soviet Union and other socialist countries can also put forward such a task: to liberate the working people in countries with bourgeois systems, so as to free them from oppression and exploitation. Just posing the question in this way is enough to clearly imagine how dangerous a path Dulles has chosen.

The statement said that Dulles' silence on the issue of peaceful coexistence is not accidental, because the adventurous "liberation" policy is incompatible with the policy of peaceful coexistence.

For perfectly understandable reasons, Dulles likes the capitalist system, so he tries his best to convince people that communism is a disaster.

However, the Soviet people and the working people of all other countries believe that capitalism is a disaster, a system that enslaves the working people. Capitalism is outdated. We firmly believe that the great ideas of communism, which are paving the way for themselves at all costs, have an irresistible attraction. We do not force anyone to accept our ideas, and we do not intend to "export" revolution to the United States or other countries, because this practice is inconsistent with the spirit of scientific communism.

The statement pointed out that Dulles not only wants to "export capitalism" to countries that have permanently broken away from the capitalist system, but also tries to curb the upsurge of national liberation movements and undermine the independence of countries that have been liberated from colonial slavery and have embarked on the path of independent development. The "Dulles-Eisenhower Doctrine" is nothing more than an attempt to re-impose colonial shackles on the countries of the Near and Middle East for the benefit of large monopoly capital. The events currently taking place in Jordan, which has become the target of imperialist conspiracies, are a typical proof of the colonialist and imperialist essence of this doctrine.

However, the progressive steps of the people who are rising up to fight for freedom and independence cannot be stopped. Their struggle is a sign of the times and an immutable historical law. The only way to conform to historical development is to act in accordance with the spirit of the times.

Those countries that act as accomplices to the imperialist groups who are keen on exacerbating the situation in this region through their policies of stirring up extremism in the Near and Middle East must also bear no small responsibility. This primarily refers to Israel, and also Turkey.

The statement also said that Dulles tries to convince people that if a war breaks out, victory will surely belong to capitalism. But the Soviet people (and not only the Soviet people) are deeply convinced that if the aggressive forces ignite the flames of a new world war against the will of the people of all countries, then capitalism, along with its system of exploitation of man by man and the phenomenon of a handful of imperialist bandits oppressing billions of people in colonies and dependent countries, will be eliminated in the flames of war.

    揭穿杜勒斯演说的侵略性质
    苏联指责美国制造紧张局势
    侵略势力如敢挑起大战必将在战火中被消灭
    新华社莫斯科26日电　塔斯社在25日发表声明说，美国国务卿杜勒斯4月22日在美联社年会上就他所谓的“决定（美国）外交政策的几个基本概念”而发表的演说，再一次表明必须对和平的敌人、自由和各国人民独立的敌人的阴谋保持警惕，时刻加以戒备。
    莫斯科各报上今天普遍刊载的这篇声明说，杜勒斯的演说的主要内容不是寻求缓和国际紧张局势的道路。鉴于他宣称他的这篇毫不谦逊的演说是阐明目前美国外交政策的原则的纲领性发言，苏联领导人发表声明说，杜勒斯的演说的露骨的侵略性质，不能不令人注意。显然，他在外交政策中选择了冒险和战争的道路。杜勒斯绝口不提和平共处的问题，却把重心放在所谓“解放”政策上，指望通过这种政策在社会主义国家复辟地主和资本家的政权。
    但是，如果按照杜勒斯的逻辑，那么，苏联和其他社会主义国家也可以提出这样的任务：解放存在着资产阶级制度的国家中的劳动人民，以便使他们免于压迫和剥削。这样提出问题就足以清楚地想像出杜勒斯选择了一条多么危险的道路。
    声明说，杜勒斯对于和平共处问题保持缄默不是偶然的，因为冒险的“解放”政策同和平共处政策是不可能相容的。
    根据完全可以理解的原因，杜勒斯喜欢资本主义制度，所以他竭力企图使人相信，共产主义就是灾祸。
    然而，苏联人和所有其他国家的劳动人民却认为资本主义是灾祸，是奴役劳动人民的制度。资本主义过时了。我们坚信，正在不顾一切地给自己开辟道路的共产主义伟大思想具有不可遏止的吸引力。我们不强迫任何人接受我们的思想，我们不打算把革命“输出”到美国或者其他国家去，因为这种做法是同科学共产主义的精神不相符的。
    声明指出，杜勒斯不但想把“资本主义”输出到那些已经永远脱离了资本主义制度的国家中去，而且还力图遏止民族解放运动的高涨，破坏那些已经从殖民奴役中解放出来，并且已经走上独立自主发展道路的国家的独立。“杜勒斯—艾森豪威尔主义”不外是为了大垄断资本的利益而把殖民镣铐重新套在中近东各国身上的尝试。目前在已经成为帝国主义阴谋对象的约旦发生的事件，是这个主义的殖民主义和帝国主义实质的典型证明。
    但是，奋起争取自由独立的人民的前进步伐是阻挡不了的。他们的斗争是时代的标志，是不可变更的历史规律。唯一符合历史发展的道路的作法就是按照时代精神行动。
    那些以自己的在中近东煽动偏激情绪的政策来充当热中于使这一地区局势尖锐化的帝国主义集团的帮凶的国家，也要负不小的责任。这首先是指以色列，也还有土耳其。
    声明又说，杜勒斯试图使人相信，战争一旦发生，胜利必定属于资本主义。而苏联人（而且不仅是苏联人）都深信，如果侵略势力违背各国人民意志燃起新世界大战的战火，那么，资本主义连同它那人剥削人的制度和一小撮帝国主义强盗压迫殖民地和附属国的亿万人民的现象都将一起在战火中被消灭。
