    Hurrying On
    Jin Jin
    Three years ago, one winter, just after the Spring Festival, I had to go to the district office for a meeting. That morning, I ran into a strong wind, the kind of wind that was really fierce. Outside the house, it sounded like a pack of wild beasts roaring, hitting the door and pushing the windows hard. Even the sound of talking inside the house was drowned out by the wind; you had to raise your voice to be heard.
    I stood at the door and looked out. The sky was full of yellow sand, like a thick fog. The distant mountain peaks and trees were invisible. The weather was bitterly cold, and the thick cotton coat I was wearing felt so light I couldn't even feel its weight. I was a little hesitant: if I went, I would be heading straight into the wind, and my eyes would be squinted shut by the sand, making it hard to open them. It would take a lot of effort to walk the eight *li*. If I didn't go, people would be waiting for me. Plus, everyone was advising me not to go, so I really wanted to find an excuse not to go.
    At times like these, what one sees around them can have a big impact. I saw a magpie flying out of its nest in a lopsided way. The strong wind pushed it back several times, but it was like a brave warrior, flying forward, flying, quickly flying into the distance.
    I put on a mask, buttoned up my cotton coat, and set off. But after only a few steps, the wind, rolling with yellow earth like a tidal wave, came at me. Before I could turn around to avoid it, I was already caught in the wind and waves. I braced my legs and leaned my back against the wind, waiting for the gust to pass before catching my breath and hurrying forward in small steps. Then, I saw another row of yellow, turbid wind and waves rushing over, so I quickly turned around again and braced my back against the wind. When I was a child, I grew up by the sea and experienced tense moments of being chased by the tide. Seeing the swirling wind and waves around me, I was reminded of those childhood scenes.
    I felt very cold, and my fingers were throbbing with pain. I thought, at this rate, I don't know when I'll get there. As I walked, I kept thinking about turning back. But the wind and waves came one after another, not giving me any time to think quietly. I gritted my teeth and decided to use all my strength to charge against the wind and waves. So, I took advantage of the times when the wind was weaker to run forward quickly, and when the yellow wind and waves came, I quickly turned around and braced myself against them. After walking halfway, my body started to feel warm, my hands and feet warmed up, and I had more energy. When I ran into the district office where the meeting was being held, the meeting was already halfway through. The comrades greeted me, thinking I definitely wouldn't come.
    I sat down and thought quietly, feeling a little happy that I was able to make it to the meeting after all, but also a little ashamed because in my life, I often lack this kind of courage to hurry on.

    赶路
    金近
    三年前的一个冬天，春节刚刚过去，我要到区办事处去开会。这天早晨正碰上刮大风，一种风力挺猛的大风，屋子外面好像有一大群野兽在吼叫，在狠狠地撞门推窗子。屋子里面说话的声音也给风声掩没了，得提高嗓子说话才能听到。
    我站在门口一看，满天都是黄沙，像一层大雾，远处的山头和树林子都望不见了，气候也冷得厉害，身上的厚棉衣，竟轻得感觉不出重量来。我有些决不定：要是去，正好是顶头风，而且眼睛也会给风沙眯住的，不容易睁开，这样走上八里地要费很大工夫；不去吧，人家会在那里等着的。再加上别人都劝我不要去，我真想找个理由不去了。
    在这样的时候，一个人对周围所看到的东西会发生很大影响的。我看到一只喜鹊歪歪斜斜地飞出窝去了，大风几次地把它顶了回来，它却像一个勇猛的战士，一直向前飞着，飞着，很快地飞到远处去了。
    我套上口罩，把棉大衣扣子全扣上，就走了。可是刚走了几步，大风卷着黄土像海潮一样地滚来，我还没有背转身来躲避，身子已经卷在风浪里了。我用劲撑住两条腿，背脊顶着风，等这阵风过去，才喘过气来，赶快跑着小步向前冲去。接着，又看到一排黄黄的、浑浊的风浪扑过来了，我再赶快转身，用背脊顶住风。我小时候是在海边长大的，也碰到过海潮追赶我们的紧张时刻。我看到周围打着滚的风浪，就想起小时候那种情景来。
    我身上觉得很冷，手指冻得隐隐发痛。我想，这样走去不知道什么时候才走到那里。一面走，一面又想回去。风浪却一个跟着一个扑来，使我静静地想一想的时间都没有。我咬一咬牙，决定使出全身的力气来，对着一个个的风浪冲击过去。就这样，我趁风势小的时候，赶紧向前跑，黄色的风浪来了，赶快背转身来顶住。走上一半路程，我的身上发热了，手脚也热了，劲儿也更足了。跑进区办事处开会的地方，会已经开了一半，同志们都跟我招呼，他们以为我一定不去了。
    我坐下来静静地想着，心里觉得有点高兴，到底能赶上开这个会，但又觉得有点惭愧，因为在我的生活中，常常缺乏这样赶路的勇气。
