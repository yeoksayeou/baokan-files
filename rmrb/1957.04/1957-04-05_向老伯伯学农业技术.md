    Learning Agricultural Techniques from Old Uncle
    Lu Wanying, Cao Zhenzhu, Members of Xinle Agricultural Cooperative

    This year, our cooperative has a heavy task of building canals. Most of the male members are working on the canals. Therefore, many of the field tasks, such as weeding the rice paddies and carrying river mud, are being undertaken by us women. Tasks that we never did before, we are now learning and doing this year.

    The men here have always said that we women are not good at production techniques, and they are reluctant to give us more complex tasks. Although we are very active, our labor remuneration is always much less than the men's. Everyone feels dissatisfied. We two discussed: skills are not innate, we are determined to learn from the old uncles with agricultural experience, learning step by step, and working hard for two or three years, we are not afraid of not learning the skills! We discussed this idea with the young sisters in the production team, and they also agreed. So, we all set three rules for learning production techniques: First, be humble, have a sincere attitude, and take the initiative to ask the old uncles for advice; Second, at the beginning, work slower and rather accept lower work points, do not compete for work points; Third, be able to withstand criticism, do not be discouraged if we are scolded for doing poorly. In this way, our production techniques have gradually improved. For example, we almost never knew how to make the "lezi" (the row spacing) in the wheat field. Male laborers could do half a mu a day, and we could only do two fen. This year, we asked the old uncles to guide us, learning the tricks while doing it. Sure enough, once we understood, we made great progress. We can do four fen a day, and the quality is the same as the men's. Another example is that when planting rapeseed, we must first make individual "tans" (菜窝, vegetable nests), and then plant the seedlings in them. Making tans is very laborious and requires skill; in the past, the male members made the tans, and the women planted the seedlings. This year, we gave up our field rest time. While the men sat down to smoke, we took our tools and learned to make tans. At first, we were very slow, the tans were not neat, and we were exhausted. However, we persisted in learning every day. Slowly, we became proficient. This year, our brigade planted forty mu of rapeseed, and some of the tans were made by us women. Old Uncle Liu Guanghui of our brigade is very kind. He teaches us patiently. Once, he stood at the head of the field watching us work, and after watching for a while, he laughed and said: "The girls are so clever, in a few years, all my old experience will be dug out by you!"

    Now the double-cropping early rice is about to be sown, and there are still many things we need to learn! This year, we also plan to learn techniques such as transplanting seedlings and pulling lines from the old uncles, and strive to master the basic techniques of rice cultivation.

    向老伯伯学农业技术
    新乐农业社社员  陆婉英  曹珍珠
    今年，我们社里筑渠道的任务比较重，大部分男社员在渠道上，于是，田里的很多活，像锄秧田、挑河泥等等，都由我们妇女担当起来了。我们从来不会做的活，今年也一面学一面做起来了。
    这里的男人们一向总说我们妇女生产技术不好，比较复杂的活都不愿多给我们做。尽管我们很积极，劳动报酬总比男人少得多。大家心里都不服气。我们两个商量：本领不会是天生的，我们下决心向有农业经验的老伯伯讨教，走一步学一步，拚上两三年功夫，不怕学不出本事来！我们把这个主意同生产队里的青年姊妹商量，她们也很赞成。于是，我们大伙儿就定了三条学习生产技术的章程：第一、要虚心、态度诚恳，主动向老伯伯请教；第二、初学手做得慢点，宁可少评些工分，不要去争工分；第三、要吃得住批评，做得不好挨骂也不灰心。这样，我们生产技术就渐渐有了进步。例如，做小麦田里的勒子（就是行距）过去我们差不多都不大会做，男劳动力一天做半亩，我们只做二分地。今年我们请老伯伯在旁边指点，一面做一面向他学窍门。果然一开窍，就有了很大进步。我们一天可以做四分地，质量也和男人做的一样。又如种油菜要先打出一个个的潭（即菜窝）来，然后把菜秧种进去。打潭很费力气，也要技术；过去全由男社员打好潭，妇女去种菜秧。今年，我们便放弃了田间休息的时间，男人们坐下来吃烟，我们却拿着工具学打潭。起初做得很慢，打的不齐整，还累得要命。但是，我们坚持天天学。慢慢地熟练了，今年我们一个大队种四十亩油菜，有一部分就是我们妇女打的潭。我们大队的刘光辉老伯伯，人挺和气。他教我们很耐心。一次，他站在田头看我们做活，看着看着就笑起来说：“姑娘家倒灵巧来，要不了几年功夫，我一肚皮老经验统统要被你们掏光了！”
    现在双季早稻快要播种了，我们要学的东西还很多呢！我们今年还准备向老伯伯学习插秧、拉线等技术，争取把种稻的几种基本技术掌握起来。
