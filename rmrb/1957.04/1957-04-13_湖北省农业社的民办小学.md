    Hubei Province Agricultural Cooperatives' People-Run Primary Schools
    The Hubei Echeng County Huaguang First Agricultural Cooperative, a national model for high rice yield, has established a primary school. Seventy to eighty children receive excellent primary education there. Each student does not need to pay much tuition; they only need to contribute the value of twenty work points each semester as remuneration for the teachers. The agricultural cooperative is responsible for the administrative expenses required for running the school. This simple and effective way of running a school is welcomed by the cooperative members.

    湖北省农业社的民办小学
    全国水稻丰产模范社——湖北省鄂城县华光第一农业社办了一所小学校，七、八十个儿童，在学校里受着良好的小学教育。每个学生，不用付出很多的学费，只要在每个学期拿出二十个工分的价值，作为对教师的酬劳。农业社担负起办学所需的行政费用。这种简易、有效的办学方式，受到了社员们的欢迎。图为华光第一农业社小学的小学生们在教室外的广场上作游戏。新华社记者　严震南摄（附图片）
