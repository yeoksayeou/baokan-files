Xinhua News Agency Comprehensive Report. According to Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, April 12th: "Al-Ahram" reported on the 11th that the Egyptian and Saudi Arabian governments have separately protested to the United States regarding the action of the U.S. oil tanker "Kern Hills" passing through the Gulf of Aqaba and sailing to Eilat, Israel, which violated Arab territorial waters.

Egyptian Deputy Foreign Minister Hassan summoned the diplomatic envoys of Arab countries stationed in Egypt on the 10th and informed them that Egyptian Foreign Minister Fawzi had already handed Egypt's protest note to the U.S. Ambassador during a meeting with U.S. Ambassador to Egypt, Hare, on the 10th.

Hassan gave the Arab countries' envoys a memorandum explaining the need for urgent consultations among Arab countries regarding the issue of U.S. oil tankers passing through the Gulf of Aqaba and sailing to Eilat, Israel.

The Saudi Arabian government formally notified the U.S. State Department that the U.S. oil tanker "Kern Hills'" action of passing through the Gulf of Aqaba "did not duly respect national sovereignty over territorial waters and disregarded the provisions of international law."

It is reported that Saudi Arabian King Saud gave Eisenhower a letter explaining Saudi Arabia's attitude on this issue, pointing out the need to avoid anything that might adversely affect the friendly relations between Saudi Arabia and the United States.

This is the third of a series of correspondence between the Saudi King and Eisenhower. Prior to this, Saudi Arabia had contacted the U.S. authorities regarding U.S. support for the internationalization of the Gulf of Aqaba. The Saudi Arabian government clearly stated that any such support would be considered a threat to Saudi Arabia and a damage to the feelings of all Muslims.

"Al-Ahram" quoted a Saudi Arabian authoritative source as saying that Saudi Arabia has warned Israel that Saudi Arabian artillery will fire on any Israeli ships attempting to pass through the Gulf of Aqaba.

"Al-Ahram" also pointed out that there are signs that there is now a double conspiracy against the Arabs. That is, on the one hand, to exert pressure so that Israel can freely pass through the Gulf of Aqaba, and on the other hand, Israel and France are formulating secret plans to seize the West Bank of the Jordan River after British troops withdraw from Jordan.

Xinhua News Agency, April 12th. TASS, New York, April 11th: According to the "New York Times", U.S. authorities have been exerting economic and political pressure on Egypt in an attempt to force Egypt to agree to the plan to "internationalize" the Suez Canal.

The newspaper expressed regret that "American political pressure and promises of economic assistance" have not had any effect, saying that now the United States, Britain, and France "intend to withhold frozen Egyptian assets until an agreement is reached."

The plan put forward by the United States, Britain, and France stipulates that "in the event of a dispute over the canal, it must be submitted to arbitration." According to reports, U.S. Ambassador to Cairo, Hare, has told the Egyptian government about these conditions.

The "New York Times" also wrote, "If Egypt does not accept the conditions stated by Hare, then the Suez Canal issue may be submitted to the Security Council or the United Nations General Assembly for handling."

The U.S. "Newsweek" even attempted to threaten Egypt by predicting that Israel would resume military operations.

    埃及和沙特阿拉伯照会美国
    抗议美国油船侵犯阿拉伯领海
    美国仍企图强迫埃及同意苏伊士运河“国际化”
    本报综合报道　据新华社开罗12日电，“金字塔报”11日报道，埃及和沙特阿拉伯政府已分别就美国油船“克恩山号”通过亚喀巴湾驶往以色列埃拉特港的侵犯阿拉伯领海的行动，向美国提出抗议。
    埃及外交部副部长哈桑10日召见了阿拉伯国家驻埃及的外交使节，并且通知他们，埃及外交部长法齐10日在和美国驻埃及大使赫尔会谈时已把埃及的抗议照会交给美国大使。
    哈桑交给阿拉伯国家的使节一份备忘录，说明阿拉伯国家之间有必要就美国油船通过亚喀巴湾驶往以色列埃拉特港的问题进行紧急磋商。
    沙特阿拉伯政府正式照会美国国务院说，美国油船“克恩山号”通过亚喀巴湾的行动“没有应有地尊重国家对领水的主权，并且无视了国际法的规定”。
    据报道，沙特阿拉伯国王沙特给了艾森豪威尔一封信，说明沙特阿拉伯对这个问题的态度，信中指出有必要避免任何可能对沙特阿拉伯和美国之间的友好关系发生不利影响的事情。
    这是沙特国王同艾森豪威尔之间的一系列来往信件的第三封。在这以前，沙特阿拉伯曾经与美国当局就美国支持亚喀巴湾国际化问题进行过接触。沙特阿拉伯政府明确表示，任何这类的支持都将被认为是对沙特阿拉伯的威胁和对所有穆斯林的感情的损害。
    “金字塔报”援引一位沙特阿拉伯权威人士的话说，沙特阿拉伯已经警告以色列，沙特阿拉伯的炮兵将对任何企图通过亚喀巴湾的以色列船只开火。
    “金字塔报”还指出，有迹象表明现在存在着一个针对阿拉伯人的双重阴谋。这就是一方面施加压力，使以色列可以自由地通过亚喀巴湾，另一方面是以色列和法国在制订秘密计划，企图在英国军队撤出约旦以后夺取约旦河的西岸。
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社纽约11日讯：据“纽约时报”报道，美国当局一直在对埃及施加经济压力和政治压力，企图迫使埃及同意苏伊士运河“国际化”的计划。
    这家报纸对“美国的政治压力和答应给予经济援助的诺言”都没有发生效果这一点表示遗憾，它说，现在美国、英国和法国“打算扣留被冻结的埃及资产，直到达成协议为止”。
    美国、英国和法国提出的方案规定，“在运河发生争执的时候，必须交付仲裁”。据报纸报道，美国驻开罗大使赫尔已经把这种条件告诉埃及政府。
    “纽约时报”还写道，“如果埃及不接受赫尔所陈述的条件，那么苏伊士运河问题可能提交安全理事会或者是联合国大会处理”。
    美国的“新闻周刊”甚至企图用预言以色列将恢复军事行动来威胁埃及。
