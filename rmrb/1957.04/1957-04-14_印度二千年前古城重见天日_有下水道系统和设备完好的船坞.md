According to news from the Indian Information Service: The archaeological team of the Ashutosh Museum of Calcutta University in India has excavated an ancient city dating back 2,300 years in Chandraketugarh, 23 miles from Calcutta. Indian archaeologists believe that the discovery of this ancient city demonstrates the civilization from the Mauryan Dynasty in the 3rd century BC to the Pala Dynasty in the 8th century AD.

This ancient city had an underground drainage system and a well-preserved dock. Among the unearthed buildings, the most interesting are the long ceramic pipes used as underground drains, and the inclined pavement that may have been a dock from the Mauryan period. Also discovered were excellent brick pavements from the Kushan Dynasty (early AD) and some residences in different strata.

Many precious artifacts were also found at this ancient city site. There are dozens of black polished pottery blanks very similar to the Greek style, typical Mauryan pottery with a thick black glaze, samples of gear-shaped porcelain from Rome, many rosary beads made of fairly precious gemstones, several BC copper coins, and a spout of a vessel belonging to the Kushan Dynasty in style.

According to the judgment of the Indian archaeological team, the dock of this ancient city was often visited by foreign ships in those years. The discovery of those gear-shaped porcelain fragments and many pottery blanks fully proves the maritime and cultural connections between ancient India and the Greek and Roman world.

According to historical records, in 326 BC, Alexander the Great of the Greek Macedonian Empire led a large army to invade India. By 321 BC, after the Greek invaders left northern India, a liberation movement began among the Indian tribes. The leader of this movement, Chandragupta Maurya, established a powerful dynasty in Indian history—the Mauryan Dynasty. The rise of this dynasty greatly promoted the political, economic, and cultural development of ancient India.

    印度二千年前古城重见天日
    有下水道系统和设备完好的船坞
    本报讯　据印度新闻处消息：印度加尔各答大学阿许托希博物馆的考古队，在离加尔各答二十三哩的昌德腊克图加地方，已经发掘出来了一座二千三百年前的古城。印度考古学家认为，这座古城的发现，表明了从公元前三世纪的孔雀王朝到公元八世纪的巴拉王朝的文明。
    这座古城有地下水道系统和设备完好的船坞。在出土的建筑物中，最有兴趣的就是用作地下沟渠的长长的陶质圆管，和可能是孔雀王朝时期的船坞的倾斜路面。同时发现的还有贵霜王朝（公元初年）时期的非常出色的砖铺路面和在不同地层中的一些住宅。
    在这个古城遗址，还发现了许多珍贵的古物。有几十个同希腊式很相像的黑色磨光的陶器坯子、上了浓黑色釉的典型孔雀王朝陶器、来自罗马的齿轮式瓷器的样品、许多用相当珍贵的宝石做的念珠、几枚公元前的铜币和一个在风格上属于贵霜王朝的器皿的喷口。
    据印度考古队判明，当年这个古城的船坞常有外国船只停泊，那些齿轮形的瓷器碎片和许多陶器坯子的发现，也充分地证明了古代印度同希腊、罗马世界的海事和文化上的联系。
    据历史记载，在公元前326年希腊马其顿帝国的亚历山大大帝曾率领大军侵入印度。到公元前321年，在希腊入侵者离开北印度以后，在印度诸部落中开始了解放运动，这次运动的领导者月护王建立了印度历史上的一个强盛的王朝——孔雀王朝。这个王朝的勃兴，使古代印度的政治、经济和文化都有了很大的发展。
