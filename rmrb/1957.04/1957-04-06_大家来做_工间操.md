Let's All Do "Calisthenics During Work Breaks"
    Chen Li
    In recent years, fewer and fewer people have been participating in calisthenics during work breaks. Especially in winter, one can hardly see anyone doing exercises on the playgrounds and corridors of some organizations.
    Perhaps some people think that calisthenics during work breaks are insignificant and that doing them or not has little impact on health. But that is not the case. For example, in one unit in Beijing that once won the Red Flag award in the 1954 national government agency calisthenics competition, more than 90% of the comrades participated in calisthenics during work breaks due to the leadership's initiative. The organization presented a vibrant atmosphere, the number of sick people decreased, and work efficiency also improved. However, since 1956, fewer and fewer people have been doing calisthenics. The leadership not only did not encourage comrades to do exercises but even criticized the dozen or so comrades who insisted on doing them regularly. As a result, the number of sick people has increased over the past year or so. This phenomenon can also be found in other organizations. Some government cadres, although they have no illnesses, are not in satisfactory health condition. Many comrades cannot cope with slightly heavier work. As for the large medical expenses of government agencies and the large number of daily visits, it has always been an important issue worthy of attention.
    In addition to paying attention to nutrition and having a regular life, the most important thing to improve health is to consistently persist in physical exercise. "Tempering makes steel strong," which is completely practical for good health. The ten-minute calisthenics during work breaks are not strenuous. It is a relatively relaxing physical activity. It can regulate mental and physical activities, promote the body's metabolism, make people's minds clear, and make them feel happy, which is beneficial to both the body and work.
    Taking twenty minutes out of precious office time to do calisthenics is an important measure by the Party and the government to care for the health of cadres and strengthen their physical fitness. The leadership of government agencies must actively give care and support. Trade unions, youth leagues, and sports associations should formulate plans, strengthen publicity, and solve specific problems in exercise based on specific situations (such as the different ages and genders of cadres, the size of the venue, and the changes in climate).
    Since each set of calisthenics only takes four or five minutes, there can be four or five minutes or five or six minutes of spare time during each ten-minute calisthenics session. These times should be fully utilized for other various sports activities. At the same time, as a result of regular calisthenics, the demand for physical activity will increase (such as playing badminton, table tennis, skipping rope, and kicking shuttlecock). Efforts should be made to encourage and support people to organize sports teams or carry out labor and defense system training. This can not only consolidate calisthenics or other sports with smaller activity volume, but also promote many people to further strengthen their physique and improve their sports skills. However, when carrying out various sports activities, one should pay attention not to carry out excessively strenuous activities within the ten-minute calisthenics time, such as playing ten minutes of football, playing ten minutes of basketball, or long-distance running. Because it is not easy to calm down in a short time after these strenuous activities, it is inevitable that one cannot return to the office to work well. When emphasizing various sports activities, one should not give up calisthenics. Various sports activities should be carried out on the premise of promoting calisthenics and mobilizing people to participate in calisthenics. If one overemphasizes various activities, there will inevitably be difficulties in venues and equipment, which will not enable the majority of cadres to carry out activities appropriately, and will actually weaken sports activities.

    大家来做“工间操”
    陈笠
    近年来，参加工间操的人越来越少了，特别是在冬季，有些机关的操场上、走廊里，甚至看不见一个做操的人。
    也许有人觉得工间操无足轻重，操不操对身体健康影响不大。其实不然。例如北京市一个曾经获得1954年国家机关工间操竞赛红旗奖的单位，当时由于领导带头，90％以上的同志参加了工间操，机关里呈现一片蓬勃气象，病号减少了，工作效率也提高了。但是自从1956年以后，做工间操的，越来越少，领导方面不仅不鼓励同志们做操，甚至对坚持经常做操的十几个同志，还给予非议。结果一年多来病号增多。这种现象在其他机关里也是可以找到的。有些机关干部虽然没有什么病，但是身体健康状况不能令人满意，略为繁重一些的工作，许多同志就做不了。至于机关医疗费用之大，每天就诊人数之多，一直是值得注意的重要问题。
    增进健康，除了注意营养、生活有规律以外，更重要的是必须经常坚持体育锻炼。“百炼成钢”对身体健康来说是完全实用的。十分钟的工间操，并不剧烈，它是一种比较轻松的体育活动。能够调剂脑力活动和体力活动，促进身体的新陈代谢，使人头脑清醒，精神愉快，对身体对工作都有益处。
    从宝贵的办公时间中，抽出二十分钟做体操，是党和政府关怀干部健康，增强干部体质的重要措施，机关领导方面必须积极给予关怀和支持。工会、青年团、体育协会应该根据具体情况（如干部年龄、性别的不同，场地的大小，气候的变化等），制定计划，加强宣传，解决锻炼中的具体问题。
    由于每套工间操只需要四、五分钟时间，每次十分钟的工间操时间，还可以有四、五分钟或五、六分钟空余的时间。应当充分运用这些时间进行其它各种体育活动。同时由于经常进行工间操的结果，身体活动的要求会越来越大（如打羽毛球，打乒乓球，跳绳，踢毽等），应该设法鼓励和支持人们组织运动队或进行劳卫制锻炼。这样不仅可以巩固工间操或其他活动量较小的运动，而且可以推动许多人进一步增强体质，和提高运动技术。但是，在进行各种各样的体育活动的时候，应该注意不能在十分钟的工间操时间内，进行过于剧烈的活动，如踢十分钟足球，打十分钟篮球，或长距离赛跑等。因为进行了这些剧烈活动以后，短时间里不容易平静下来，必然不能很好地回到办公室去工作。在重视各种各样的体育活动时，也不要放弃工间操，应该在推广工间操，动员人们都参加工间操的前提下，再去进行各种各样的体育活动。如果过于强调各种各样的活动，必然在场地、器材上发生困难，不能使广大干部都能适当地进行活动，实际上就会减弱体育活动。
