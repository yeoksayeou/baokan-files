Mother and Son
By our correspondent Zhang Jing

    In the Suzhou Municipal Party Committee's dining hall, everyone can see a young man of about thirty years old accompanying a white-haired old lady into the canteen at mealtimes. After the young man helps the old lady to a seat, he orders some soft dishes to suit her taste. Sometimes, when he orders a palatable meat dish, they always push the dish back and forth, neither willing to start eating first. Those who don't know the situation might think they are guests being polite to each other! In fact, they are Fang Xishun, a Chinese language teacher at the Suzhou Municipal Cadre Spare-time Cultural School, and his mother, Lin Shuying.

    Many people told me in unison: "This is truly a mother and son who depend on each other for life. It's rare to have such a kind and considerate good mother and such a filial and upright good son!"

    Fang Xishun's mother was a woman who suffered very unfortunate marriages in the old society. Her husband worked in a Kuomintang agency and developed many bad habits, such as drinking and whoring, which caused her great mental suffering. After her husband died, he left behind Fang Xishun and his sister. The family was in dire straits, penniless. The burden of life fell entirely on the mother's shoulders. To maintain the children's schooling expenses and the living expenses of the family of three, the mother did needlework for others day and night, in addition to relying on some relatives and friends for assistance. The mother's deep love and hardworking character deeply moved and educated her son. The son's love for his mother naturally deepened.

    In 1947, when Fang Xishun was studying at a university in Henan, it was the most difficult time in his and his mother's life. Although Fang Xishun's schooling was paid for by the Kuomintang, who would bear the cost of his mother's living? The public funding was extremely limited, barely enough to maintain a person's minimum living needs, let alone provide for his mother? However, Fang Xishun solved this difficulty. It turned out that Fang Xishun saved part of his meager public funding for his mother, and secretly bought some sweet potatoes, corn, and other coarse grains, which he stewed in a small jar on the public stove. He ate two meals a day, often eating cold food in winter and sometimes even eating spoiled food in summer. Sometimes he didn't even taste a single vegetable peel for the entire month.

    In Fang Xishun's situation, studying at university was not only difficult in terms of living expenses, but also cost a lot of money each year to buy books. However, he knew his mother's hardship and never asked her for a penny. If he needed something urgently for his studies, he would go to the library to copy it, often copying until very late before returning. However, this also couldn't escape his mother's eyes. When his mother saw many ant-like small characters written on his copy, she felt as if needles were pricking her heart. One night, while Xishun was not at home, she dragged the box from under the bed, rummaged through it, and finally found a short lambskin coat that she had worn when she got married. This was the last souvenir she had left. She took out the lambskin coat and gave it to her son, saying, "Take it and sell it to buy books!" Fang Xishun was shocked and initially refused to take it, but his mother, with tears in her eyes, forced her son to say: "Accept your mother's heart! I have no use for it. In the future, when you become successful, you can buy me a new one." Only then did she persuade her son. Fang Xishun sold the coat and bought a complete collection of Zhu Xi's works. From then on, he more diligently studied ancient Chinese literature. Later, after Fang Xishun graduated, he encountered an even more difficult situation. Many people advised him to sell that book, but Fang Xishun still gritted his teeth and overcame the difficulty. He regarded that complete collection of Zhu Xi's works as "his mother's heart" and still treasures it in his bookcase today.

    When his mother was sick, Fang Xishun was even more inseparable, serving her day and night. One summer, during the school's summer vacation, his mother had a severe case of dysentery, having dozens of bowel movements a day. Unfortunately, they lived upstairs, and it was very inconvenient for her to move around. At that time, even eating was difficult, let alone having money to find someone to help. Fang Xishun moved out of the school dormitory and stayed by his mother's bedside during the day, and slept in the courtyard downstairs at night, bringing her tea and medicine day and night. He even washed her chamber pot.

    After liberation in 1949, Fang Xishun, a poor college student who couldn't find a way out in the era of reactionary Kuomintang rule, found a job at this time. He first worked as a history teacher at Suzhou Municipal No. 1 Middle School, and last year he was transferred to the Suzhou Municipal Cadre Spare-time Cultural School as a Chinese language teacher. His monthly salary of fifty or sixty yuan (recently increased to seventy yuan) allowed the mother and son to end their long-term difficult life.

    Although the living environment has improved, Fang Xishun still maintains the habit of saving and spending sparingly, doing his best to fulfill his childhood wish for his mother: "To make my mother's old age happy and to compensate for the wounds in her heart in her later years!"

    Every year, Fang Xishun remembers his mother's birthday. Perhaps his mother herself had long forgotten this day, but he always reminds her. On this day, Fang Xishun always makes his mother have a more enjoyable day. Either accompany his mother for a walk, or let her make a few dishes to her liking. On his mother's birthday last year, he remembered that his mother had not worn a good warm coat for many years. He remembered his mother's lambskin coat from that year, so he specially went to the Suzhou Consignment Store and spent thirty yuan to pick out a warm and soft long-pile coat for his mother as a birthday gift. On holidays, Fang Xishun rarely goes out alone. Whenever he goes out to play, he always takes his mother with him. His mother loves to see flowers and loves to sit or walk in the gardens. He follows his mother's interests and hobbies. Sometimes, on sunny days, he helps his mother take a walk in Suzhou's famous gardens. Sometimes, in the pleasant autumn season, he accompanies his mother to appreciate chrysanthemums and patiently explains the names of various flowers to his mother. Now, Xishun already has a fiancé working at the Suzhou Municipal People's Bank, but he doesn't alienate his mother because of this. Sometimes he still patiently accompanies his mother and lover, and the three of them go to see a play together. He told his lover: "My mother is old, and the days I have with her are getting fewer and fewer. If she feels that her son has alienated her after having a wife, she will definitely be sad." Fang Xishun's lover understands this feeling very well, so she is also very affectionate towards his mother.

    Fang Xishun is also a hardworking, earnest, and responsible teacher at school. Every time he teaches a Chinese language class, he always finds a lot of materials to prepare his lessons. Often, the teaching materials he prepares are too rich to be covered in several lectures. Moreover, in teaching, he often integrates his own emotions into the text, so that students can accept the infection and education of the text from the perspective of thoughts and feelings. He also pays attention to cultivating students' interest in the Chinese language. Therefore, last year he was commended as an excellent teacher within the school.

    The deeds of Fang Xishun and Lin Shuying, this mother and son, may be very trivial and ordinary! However, compared with those who live well but are unwilling to support their own parents, isn't this sincere affection for the mother a social virtue?

    母与子
    本报记者　张竞
    在苏州市委的饭堂里，每到吃饭的时候，大家可以看见一个年约三十岁左右的青年人，陪着一个白发苍苍的老太太，走进食堂里来。青年人扶着老太太坐定后，便顺着老年人的胃口定一些松软的菜，有时定到一份可口的荤菜，两个人总是把菜盆推过来让过去，谁也不肯先动筷子。不知道的人还以为他们是宾主相让呢！其实，他们是苏州市干部业余文化学校的语文教师方希舜和他的母亲林淑英。
    许多人异口同声地告诉我：“这真是一对相依为命的母子，有这样一个善良而体贴的好母亲，又有这样一个孝顺而正直的好儿子，实在是难得！”
    方希舜的母亲，是一个在旧时代里婚姻遭遇上很不幸的女人。她丈夫在国民党机关里做事，染了一身恶习气，酗酒、嫖女人，使她在精神上受尽折磨。丈夫死后，留下方希舜和他的姊姊，家境窘迫，一贫如洗，生活的重担全部落到母亲身上，为了维持子女上学的费用和一家三口的生活，除依靠一些亲戚朋友的接济外，母亲整日整夜为人家做针线。母亲那种深沉的爱和勤劳的性格深深地感动了儿子，教导了儿子。儿子对母亲的爱自然地深厚起来。
    1947年，方希舜在河南一个大学里读书时，是他和他母亲生活上最艰难的时候。虽然，方希舜读书是用的国民党的公费，可是母亲的生活谁来负担？公费本来就极为有限，维持一个人最低的生活尚且不得温饱，哪来的钱供养母亲呢？但是，方希舜解决了这个困难。原来，方希舜把自己的少得可怜的一点公费省下了一部分给母亲，自己便瞒着母亲买些山芋、玉米之类的杂粮，用小罐子在老虎灶上煨了吃，一天吃两顿，冬天常常吃冷的，夏天有时还得吃馊的。有时整个月里连一根菜皮也没有尝过。
    像方希舜这样的处境，在大学里念书，岂但是生活上的困难，每年买书也得花很大一笔钱；但他知道母亲的困苦，从来不伸手向母亲要一文钱。如果学习上十分需要时，自己就进图书馆去抄，常常抄到很晚才回来。可是这也瞒不过母亲的眼睛，母亲看见他抄本上写着许多蚂蚁样的小字，心里就好像针刺一样，晚上，趁希舜不在家，她就把床底下的箱子拖出来，翻来翻去，终于找到出嫁时的一件短羔皮袄，这是她留下的最后一件纪念品，她把这件羔皮袄拿了出来，交给儿子说：“拿去卖了买书吧！”方希舜吃了一惊，起初一定不肯要，可是母亲?着眼泪逼着儿子说：“你接受妈妈的这颗心吧！我留着没有用，将来你学成了人，再买新的给我好了。”这才说服了儿子，方希舜卖掉皮袄去买了一部“朱子全集”，从此，更加勤奋地钻研中国的古代文学。以后，方希舜毕业后，曾有一段更困难的遭遇，好多人都劝他把那部书卖掉，但方希舜还是咬紧牙关熬过了困难，他把那部“朱子全集”当作“母亲的心”，至今还珍藏在自己的书柜里。
    母亲生病的时候，方希舜更是朝夕不离，日夜侍奉。有一个夏天，是学校放暑假的时候，母亲生了一场很厉害的痢疾，一天要拉几十次，不巧又住在楼上，行动很不方便，那时，吃饭都困难，哪有钱找人帮忙。方希舜便从学校宿舍里搬出来，白天陪在母亲床边，晚上便睡在楼下天井里，日夜送茶端药，连母亲的尿盆都由他来洗刷。
    1949年解放后，方希舜这个在国民党反动统治时代找不到出路的穷大学生，到这时找到了职业。他先在苏州市立一中担任过文史教师，去年又调到苏州市干部业余文化学校担任语文教师，每月有五、六十元的薪水（最近又增加到七十元），使母子俩从此结束了长期的窘困的生活。
    虽然生活环境好转了，方希舜自己却依然保持着省吃俭用的习惯，尽最大的努力对母亲实现自己幼时的愿望：“让母亲的晚年得到幸福，让母亲心上的创伤，在晚年得到补偿！”
    每年，方希舜都记住了母亲的生日，也许，母亲自己早就忘记了这个日子，但每次总是他提醒起来。这一天，方希舜总是特别要让母亲过得更愉快些。或者陪着母亲出去散步；或者让她做几样合口胃的饭菜。去年，母亲生日的那一天，他想起母亲多年来没有穿过一件好的御寒的大衣，他想起了母亲当年的那件羔皮袄，于是，他特地到苏州市寄售商店，花了三十块钱替母亲拣了一件既暖和又轻软的长毛绒大衣，作为生日的礼物送给母亲。每逢休假的日子，方希舜也很少一个人出外，只要是出去玩，他总要把母亲带着。母亲很爱看花，爱在园林里小坐或散步，他便随着母亲的兴致所好，有时在春光明媚的日子里，扶着母亲在苏州著名的园林里散散步，有时在秋色宜人的季节里，陪着母亲欣赏菊花，还耐心地把各种花名解释给母亲听。现在，希舜已经有了未婚的爱人，在苏州市人民银行工作，但他也并不因此而疏远了自己的母亲，有时仍那么耐心地陪着母亲和爱人，三个人一同去看戏。他告诉爱人：“母亲年纪大了，和我在一起的日子越来越少了，假使让她感觉到儿子有了媳妇就疏远了她，心里一定会难过的。”方希舜的爱人很理解这份心情，所以对他的母亲也很亲热。
    方希舜在学校里也是一个刻苦认真、勇于负责的教师，每上一节语文课，他总是要找很多材料备课，往往准备的教材太丰富了，讲几次也讲不完。而且在教学中，常常把自己的感情也融会在课文里，使学生能从思想感情上接受课文的感染和教育，他也很注意培养同学们对中国语言的兴趣。因而去年他被校内表扬为优秀教师。
    方希舜和林淑英，这一对母子的事迹，也许是很琐碎而平凡的吧！但是，如果把方希舜和那些自己生活过得很好而不肯赡养亲生父母的人相比，这种对母亲的真切的感情不是可以称为社会的美德吗？
