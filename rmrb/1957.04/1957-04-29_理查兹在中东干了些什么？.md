    What Did Richards Do in the Middle East?
    U.S. President's Special Envoy Richards has been active in the Middle East for nearly two months. He has traveled to many countries, and although his journey is not yet finished according to plan, he suddenly wants to slip away from the region on some pretext. According to a statement by the U.S. State Department on April 25th, he is about to go to Bonn to have a "consultation" with Secretary of State Dulles, who is preparing to attend the Ministerial Council meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization there, and then see if he "still has to return to the Middle East." What exactly has this salesman of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" done during his activities in the Middle East?
    When Richards set off from Washington to the Middle East, he declared ambitiously: "There is hope that all Middle Eastern countries will agree to the U.S. plan." But after circling the Middle East, he found that despite his "painstaking efforts," he could not dispel the doubts of Middle Eastern countries about American aggression. So far, the only countries supporting the "Eisenhower Doctrine" are members of the Baghdad Pact group, such as Turkey and Iraq. According to the American oil tycoon Rockefeller, the governments of these countries are fish that have already been hooked, and it is not surprising that they support the "Eisenhower Doctrine." The purpose of Richards' visit to the Middle East was not to win over these countries, but to break into those Arab countries that uphold their national independence and sovereignty, and force them to accept the "Eisenhower Doctrine." From this point of view, Richards clearly failed to achieve its intended goal. In Sudan and Yemen, he achieved nothing. The Sudanese government told Richards that the "Eisenhower Doctrine" might "lead to an all-out cold war," and that "Sudan hopes to maintain complete independence and sovereignty." In Afghanistan, despite Richards' loud cries about the so-called "threat of international communism," Afghan Prime Minister Daoud Khan issued a statement pointing out that his country adheres to neutrality and hopes to maintain friendly relations with all countries. As for Egypt, Syria, and Jordan, Richards was met with strong opposition from the people of these countries before he even arrived, so that he had to stay on the Ethiopian plateau to observe the situation. According to American news agencies, Dulles summoned him to Bonn to "pull Richards out of the Middle East," so that he could "escape an awkward situation."
    The unpleasant interruption of Richards' activities in the Middle East shows that the people of the Middle East are determined not to accept the "Eisenhower Doctrine."
    However, it would be incorrect to say that Richards' trip to the Middle East was fruitless, or that he would give up. The recent political crisis in Jordan was caused by the "Eisenhower Doctrine" and Richards' activities in the Middle East. The nature of the Jordanian political crisis is the struggle of the Jordanian people, who uphold national independence and sovereignty, against the reactionary forces in Jordan who advocate accepting the "Eisenhower Doctrine" aggressive plan. The United States' choice of Jordan to start with was premeditated. The United States wants to undermine the nationalist government of Jordan in order to break up the unity between Arab countries, isolate Egypt and Syria, and exclude British influence from Jordan, so that it can freely implement the "Eisenhower Doctrine" aggressive plan in the Middle East. The U.S. Embassy in Amman openly interfered in the Jordanian events, and the United States hurriedly moved its Sixth Fleet from the seas of France and Italy to areas close to Jordan to intimidate the Jordanian people, which even the U.S. propaganda machine does not hide.
    Richards' trip to the Middle East was indeed quite successful in further excluding British influence in the Middle East. The United States has apparently strengthened its control over those Middle Eastern countries originally controlled by Britain, especially the member states of the Baghdad Pact group. The United States' announcement of its participation in the Baghdad Pact Military Committee, as Richards said, is the United States acting as a "full member of Baghdad." The United States also announced that it would give Iraq "additional military assistance," thereby placing Iraq further under its control. American influence has also further penetrated Libya, which has a thirty-year "Treaty of Friendship and Alliance" with Britain. Richards is actively working to build a so-called strategic highway from Ankara through Iran and Iraq to Karachi, and to build a railway system connecting Turkey and Iran, which is to kick out all British influence from these areas.
    The United States' implementation of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" in the Middle East and Richards' trip to the Middle East have further deepened the irreconcilable contradiction between the American colonialists and the Arab countries of the Middle East. It has made the people of the Middle East see more clearly that the American colonialists are their most vicious enemies, which will arouse the people of the Middle East to fight more resolutely to defend their national independence. At the same time, the implementation of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" cannot but arouse resistance from the British colonial forces, which will further intensify the contradictions between American and British imperialism. No matter how rampant American colonialism is in the Middle East today, it is only the people of the Middle East who can determine the fate of the Middle East, and the "Eisenhower Doctrine" aggressive plan will ultimately be completely bankrupt under the blows of the people of the Middle East.

### 理查兹在中东干了些什么？

    理查兹在中东干了些什么？
    美国总统特使理查兹到中东去活动已经将近两个月了，他走了不少国家，他的旅程按照计划还没有结束，现在却忽然想借故从这个地区溜走了。据美国国务院4月25日宣布，他即将去波恩，同准备在那里参加北大西洋公约组织部长理事会会议的国务卿杜勒斯进行一次“商谈”，然后看情况“还要回到中东”去。这位“艾森豪威尔主义”的推销员在中东活动期间，究竟干了些什么呢？
    理查兹在从华盛顿动身到中东去的时候，曾野心勃勃地扬言：“对于所有中东国家将赞成美国计划，抱有希望”。但是他在中东兜了一圈之后，他发现他尽管“煞费苦心”，却不能消除中东各国对美国侵略的疑虑。迄今为“艾森豪威尔主义”捧场的，仍然是土耳其、伊拉克等巴格达条约集团的成员国。按照美国石油大王洛克菲勒的说法，这些国家的政府是已经上钩的鱼，它们为“艾森豪威尔主义”捧场是不足为奇的。理查兹到中东去的目的，并不是要拉拢这些国家，而是想打进那些维护自己民族独立主权的阿拉伯国家，迫使它们接受“艾森豪威尔主义”。从这一点看，理查兹显然没有达到它的预定目的。在苏丹和也门，他没有获得任何结果，苏丹政府对理查兹说，“艾森豪威尔主义”可能“导致全面的冷战”，“苏丹希望保持完全的独立和主权”。在阿富汗，尽管理查兹大叫大喊所谓“国际共产主义的威胁”，而阿富汗首相达乌德汗发表声明指出，他的国家坚持中立，并希望同一切国家保持友好关系。至于埃及、叙利亚和约旦，理查兹还没去就遭到这些国家人民的强烈反对，以致他不得不中途在埃塞俄比亚高原上呆下来，以观风色。据美国通讯社说，杜勒斯召他到波恩去，就是要“把理查兹拉出中东”，使他有可能“脱离一个尴尬的局面”。
    理查兹在中东活动的不愉快的中断，说明了中东各国人民坚决不要“艾森豪威尔主义”。
    但是，如果说理查兹的中东之行一事无成，或者他会就此罢手，那是不确实的。最近约旦发生的政治危机，就是由于“艾森豪威尔主义”和理查兹在中东的活动挑起来的。约旦政治危机的性质，是维护民族独立主权的约旦人民反对主张接受“艾森豪威尔主义”侵略计划的约旦反动势力的斗争。而美国选择约旦来开刀，是蓄谋已久的。美国要搞垮约旦的民族主义政府，是想拆散阿拉伯国家之间的团结，孤立埃及和叙利亚，并从约旦排除英国的势力，以便它在中东地区放手推行“艾森豪威尔主义”侵略计划。美国驻安曼大使馆公开出面干预约旦事件，美国连忙从法国和意大利海面把它的第六舰队调到靠近约旦的地区来，恫吓约旦人民，就是美国宣传机关也从不隐讳的。
    理查兹的中东之行，对美国进一步排斥英国在中东的势力，的确是相当成功的。美国显然加强了对原来受英国控制的那些中东国家，特别是加强了对巴格达条约集团成员国的控制。美国宣布参加巴格达条约军事委员会，正如理查兹所说的，这是美国作为“巴格达的十足成员国”。美国还宣布给予伊拉克以“额外的军事援助”，从而更进一步把伊拉克置于自己的控制之下。美国势力也进一步渗入了同英国订有三十年“友好同盟条约”的利比亚。理查兹积极活动由美国建筑一条从安卡拉经过伊朗和伊拉克到卡拉奇的所谓战略公路，并建筑一个衔接土耳其和伊朗的铁路系统，这就是要把英国势力从这些地区全部踢出去。
    美国在中东实行“艾森豪威尔主义”和理查兹的中东之行，进一步加深了美国殖民者和中东阿拉伯国家之间的不可调和的矛盾。它使中东人民更看清了美国殖民者是他们最凶恶的敌人，从而将会激起中东人民更坚决地为保卫民族独立而斗争。同时，“艾森豪威尔主义”的实施，不会不引起英国殖民势力的反抗，因而将进一步加剧美英帝国主义间的矛盾。不论美国殖民主义今天在中东怎样猖狂，决定中东地区命运的只能是中东人民，“艾森豪威尔主义”侵略计划终归是会在中东人民的打击下完全破产的。
