Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 18th: The statement of the talks between the delegations of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Albanian Labor Party, signed in Moscow on April 17, stated that the relations between the countries of the socialist family are based on the complete equality of all countries within this family, respect for the sovereignty and national interests of every country, large and small, and that this relationship can guarantee the growth of the spiritual and material strength of the people of every socialist country and the entire camp.

    The Albanian Labor Party delegation pointed out that the Albanian people believe that the fraternal friendship with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries is their most important historical achievement, and that the consolidation of the unity and fraternal cooperation of the socialist camp is a reliable guarantee of their national independence and a decisive condition for the successful construction of socialism in Albania.

    This statement, signed by Nikita Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and Enver Hoxha, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, emphasized that now, when international reactionaries are trying to incite nationalist tendencies and undermine the friendship and close cooperation of socialist countries, it is of particular importance to further strengthen the unity of the socialist camp. Both sides believe that it is their internationalist task to resolutely combat any attempt by anyone to shake the unity of the socialist camp.

    The two parties' representatives pointed out that the practice of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, Albania, and other socialist countries fully confirms the Marxist-Leninist thesis that although the specific forms and methods of solving the tasks of socialist construction may differ due to the national, social, and other characteristics of various countries, the basic laws of socialist revolution and socialist construction are the same for all countries. The exchange of experience between socialist countries enriches socialist practice and benefits the creative development of the cause of scientific socialism.

    The participants in the talks believe that it is necessary to further unite the Communist and Workers' Parties on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and to strengthen the struggle against any attempt to revise Marxist-Leninist theory.

    The statement said that historical experience clearly shows that in the era of the existence of the socialist family of nations, any statement that socialism can be built separately from other socialist countries outside this family objectively harms the cause of socialism and peace, because this tendency leads to the dispersion and weakening of socialist forces.

    The two party delegations unanimously agreed that the improvement of relations between Yugoslavia and other socialist countries, which began in 1955-1956 after the elimination of the conflict with Yugoslavia and the well-known Soviet-Yugoslav Declaration, is beneficial to the people of these countries, to the consolidation of the cause of peace, and in the interests of the international workers' movement. However, it is regrettable that recently, after the Hungarian events, the relations between the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the Communist and Workers' Parties began to develop in another direction. The two party delegations expressed their willingness to make all necessary efforts to improve relations and contacts with the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and to cooperate with it on the basis of Marxist-Leninist ideology and the principles of proletarian internationalism. The two party delegations hope that the leadership of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia will also take corresponding measures to achieve this cooperation.

    The statement concluded by saying that the two parties advocate establishing and expanding contacts and exchanges with socialist parties in order to establish united action in the ranks of the international workers' movement.

    苏共和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党联合声明
    加强社会主义阵营的团结具有重大意义
    新华社18日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：4月17日在莫斯科签字的苏联共产党和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党代表团会谈声明说，社会主义大家庭各国相互关系是以这一大家庭内各国完全平等、尊重每一个大小国家的主权和民族利益为基础的，这种关系可以保证每一个社会主义国家的人民和整个阵营的一切精神和物质力量的增长。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党代表团指出，阿尔巴尼亚人民认为，同苏联和其他社会主义国家的兄弟友谊是自己最重要的历史成果，并且认为社会主义阵营各国的团结和兄弟合作的巩固是自己的民族独立的可靠保证和在阿尔巴尼亚成功地建设社会主义的决定条件。
    这一篇由苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会第一书记霍查签署的声明强调指出，现在，在国际反动派竭力煽动民族主义倾向和破坏社会主义各国的友谊和紧密合作的时候，进一步加强社会主义阵营的团结具有特别重大的意义。会谈双方认为同任何人所采取的动摇社会主义阵营团结的任何企图进行最坚决的斗争是自己的国际主义任务。
    两党代表指出，苏联、阿尔巴尼亚和其他社会主义国家的社会主义建设实践，完全证实了马克思列宁主义的这样一个论点：虽然解决社会主义建设任务的具体形式和方法可能由于各个国家的民族、社会和其他特点而有所不同，然而社会主义革命和社会主义建设的基本发展规律对一切国家都是相同的。社会主义国家间互相交流经验会丰富社会主义的实践并且对创造性地发展科学的社会主义的事业有好处。
    会谈参加者认为必须在马克思列宁主义基础上进一步团结共产党和工人党、加强反对修正马克思列宁主义理论的任何企图的斗争。
    声明说，历史经验十分清楚地表明，在存在社会主义国家大家庭的时代里，任何所谓可以脱离这个大家庭的其他社会主义国家而单独地建设社会主义的言论，客观上都给社会主义与和平事业带来损害，因为这种倾向导致社会主义力量的分散和削弱。
    两党代表团一致认为，在消除同南斯拉夫的冲突和通过人所共知的苏南宣言以后于1955—1956年开始的南斯拉夫同其他社会主义国家之间关系的改善是有利于这些国家的人民、有利于巩固和平事业并且符合国际工人运动的利益的。但是遗憾的是，近来，在匈牙利事件以后，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟同共产党和工人党之间的关系开始朝着另一个方向发展。两党代表团表示愿意作一切必要的努力，改善同南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的关系和联系，在马克思列宁主义思想基础上、无产阶级国际主义的原则上同它合作。两党代表团希望南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟领导方面也采取相应措施来实现这种合作。
    声明最后说，两党主张建立和扩大同社会主义政党的联系和接触，以求在国际工人运动的队伍中建立一致的行动。
