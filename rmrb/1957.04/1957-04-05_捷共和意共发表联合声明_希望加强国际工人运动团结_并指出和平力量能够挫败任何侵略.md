Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 4th: Radio Prague broadcast on April 3rd the joint statement from the meeting of the Italian Communist Party delegation and the Czechoslovak Communist Party delegation held in Prague from March 29th to April 1st.

The statement pointed out that the peace-loving forces of all countries, first and foremost the resolute actions of the Soviet Union in defending peace, can thwart any attempt at aggression.

The two party delegations expressed solidarity with and support for the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Hungarian government's efforts to realize a program of consolidating the economy and strengthening socialist democracy.

In the statement, the two party delegations firmly condemned the "Eisenhower Doctrine," expressed opposition to the resurgence of German militarism, opposition to the threat of a new war in Europe, supported the demands for the abolition of all military bases, the withdrawal of troops stationed on foreign territories, the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction and the testing of such weapons, and advocated the establishment of effective all-European economic cooperation.

The statement pointed out that, in the new situation created by the emergence of the world socialist system, the activities, friendship, and unity of the Communist and Workers' Parties, and the strengthening of cooperation between them, are of decisive significance for the further development and new achievements of the struggle of the people of all countries for independence and democracy, for socialism and peace.

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which was the first to complete the socialist revolution and lead the country in advancing towards communism, has accumulated a wealth of experience that is of fundamental significance for the entire international workers' movement.

The statement emphasized that now, when international reactionaries are launching frenzied attacks on the communist movement, it is necessary to wage a resolute struggle against all manifestations of revisionism and nationalism.

The statement concluded by saying that the two party delegations discussed measures to further deepen the fraternal cooperation between the two parties.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 4th: "Rude Pravo" reported on April 3rd that the head of the Italian Communist Party delegation visiting Czechoslovakia, Pajetta, had left Prague for home on April 2nd. Before leaving, he made a statement expressing great satisfaction with the meeting between the Czechoslovak and Italian Communist Party delegations. Pajetta said that the joint statement of the two parties reflects a principled agreement on the issues discussed and the common desire of the two parties to strengthen the unity of the workers' movement and to improve the cooperation between the Communist and Workers' Parties.

Pajetta said, we believe that only on the basis of practical socialist internationalism is it possible to find the path and policy to socialism that combines one's own specific circumstances and national traditions, and that in no case should one abandon revolutionary principles or give way to reformist or nationalist tendencies. A common characteristic of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia and the Communist Party of Italy is that they have solid ties with the working masses of the two countries and recognize that these masses are the main force in the struggle for democratic development and socialist construction.

Pajetta said that the two parties will firmly strive to achieve their policies, because the policies they implement in the two countries are in line with the fundamental interests of the people and are therefore supported by them.

    新华社布拉格4日电　布拉格电台3日广播了意大利共产党代表团和捷克斯洛伐克共产党代表团3月29日到4月1日在布拉格举行的会谈的联合声明。
    声明指出，各国爱好和平的力量，首先是苏联保卫和平的坚决行动能够挫败任何侵略的企图。
    两党代表团表示声援并且支持匈牙利社会主义工人党和匈牙利政府努力实现巩固经济和加强社会主义民主的纲领。
    两党代表团在声明中坚决谴责“艾森豪威尔主义”，表示反对德国军国主义的再起，反对欧洲新战争的威胁，支持主张撤消一切军事基地、撤退外国领土上的驻军、禁止大规模毁灭性的武器以及禁止这种武器的试验的要求，并且主张建立有效的全欧洲的经济合作。
    声明指出，在由于出现世界社会主义体系而形成的新的情况下，共产党和工人党的活动、友谊和团结，它们之间合作的加强，对于各国人民争取独立和民主、争取社会主义与和平的斗争的进一步发展和取得新的成就，具有决定性的意义。
    第一个完成了社会主义革命并且领导国家最先向着共产主义前进的苏联共产党积累了大量经验，这些经验对整个国际工人运动有着原则性的意义。
    声明中强调说，现在，当国际反动派对共产主义运动进行疯狂袭击的时候，必须对一切修正主义和民族主义的表现展开坚决斗争。
    声明最后说，两党代表团讨论了使两党间的兄弟合作进一步深入的措施。
    据新华社布拉格4日电　“红色权利报”3日报道，访问捷克斯洛伐克的意大利共产党代表团团长巴叶塔2日已经离开布拉格回国。他在离开之前发表了谈话，对这次捷共和意共代表团的会谈表示十分满意。巴叶塔说，两党联合声明反映出对所讨论的问题在原则上的意见一致以及两党要加强工人运动的团结和使共产党和工人党的合作更加完善的共同愿望。
    巴叶塔说，我们认为，只有在实际的社会主义国际主义基础上，才可能找到各自的同实际情况和民族传统相结合的走向社会主义的道路和政策，这在任何情况下都不容许抛弃革命的原则或者向改良主义或民族主义的倾向让步。捷克斯洛伐克共产党和意大利共产党的共同特点在于它们同两国劳动群众有巩固联系，并且认识到争取民主发展和社会主义建设的主力正是这些群众。
    巴叶塔说，两党将信心坚定地争取它们的政策得到实现，因为它们在两国执行的政策是符合人民群众的基本利益的，因此是得到他们的支持的。
