    Talking About Side Effects
  　Tie Hang
    I would like to talk about the problem of side effects in essays. Is there really anything that has absolutely no side effects at all? Advocating for streamlining, thrift, and hard work is undoubtedly a good thing, but there are also some bureaucrats who use it as a shield to refuse to solve problems that should be solved. "You say I don't care about the lives of the masses? I'm increasing production and practicing economy!"
    Things always have two sides, and our task is to grasp its main side, that is, the mainstream. As long as the mainstream of an article is to cure diseases and save people, and is beneficial to socialism, then it is acceptable; even if there are some slight side effects, it doesn't matter and there is no need to be alarmed. Of course, if the mainstream of an article is "side effects," it is unacceptable. This is just like a medicine that cures intestinal disease but causes stomach disease; of course, it is unacceptable. But if it can cure one disease but slightly damages one "meridian," it is unavoidable, the so-called "cure one meridian, damage one meridian." It is impossible to demand one hundred percent comprehensiveness and no side effects in anything. We cannot refrain from eating for fear of choking.

    谈副作用
  　铁航
    我想谈谈关于小品文的副作用的问题。实际上哪有什么事绝对一点副作用也没有？提倡精简节约、艰苦朴素，无疑是好事，可是也还有些官僚主义者用它作挡箭牌，拒不解决应该解决的问题。“你说我不关心群众生活么？我这是增产节约啊！”
    事物总是有两面的，我们的任务就是要抓住它的主要一面即主流。一篇文章只要其主流是治病救人，是有利于社会主义的，就要得；即使有某种轻微的副作用，也无关紧要，无须乎大惊小怪。当然，如果一篇文章其主流就是“副作用”，是要不得的。这正好像一种药如果治好了肠病，又得上胃病，当然要不得；但是如果能治好一种病而对某一“经”稍有轻微损伤，却在所难免，所谓“治一经、损一经”。无论什么事，要求百分之百的全面，要求一点副作用没有，是不可能的。我们不能因噎废食。
