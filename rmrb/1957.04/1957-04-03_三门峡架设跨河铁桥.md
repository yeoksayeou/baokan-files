Xinhua News Agency, Sanmenxia, April 2nd. Construction of the cross-river railway bridge for the Sanmenxia project has begun on the 2nd.

This 192-meter-long railway bridge will be built near the砥柱石 below Sanmen Gorge. Once completed, it will be the main cross-river artery for the first phase of the project, facilitating the transport of large quantities of concrete mixed on the right bank and various heavy machinery to the left bank construction site. The concrete mixing system for this site is located on the right bank because the left bank consists entirely of steep cliffs.

It is expected that the bridge will be completed by February next year, when concrete pouring begins on the left bank.

    三门峡架设跨河铁桥
    新华社三门峡2日电　为兴修三门峡工程而架设的跨河铁桥已在2日开工。
    这座长一百九十二公尺的铁桥将架设在三门以下的砥柱石近处，它建成后将是第一期工程的主要跨河动脉，以便把在右岸拌和的大量混凝土以及各种重型机械，运送到左岸工地。这个工地的混凝土拌和系统是设在右岸的，因为左岸都是悬崖陡壁。
    预计明年2月前，左岸开始浇灌混凝土时这座桥就可完工。
