    Wujin Specialty: White Bone Fans
    As early as more than two thousand years ago, the area around Hutang Town in Wujin County, Jiangsu Province, was rich in white fan bones made of cow bones, which sold well throughout the country. Thirty years ago, artisans began to make exquisite patterns on the fan bones, cover them with silk, and paint them with colorful drawings. Thus, white bone fans became a specialty of Wujin County and were sold far and wide on the international market.
    After liberation, nearly one hundred employees in the county organized production cooperatives (or production teams), and the quantity and quality of products greatly improved. The Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries, as well as various parts of Southeast Asia, are competing to place orders. This year's planned exports of more than 30,000 fans can earn back more than 200 tons of steel.
    White bone fans are special handicrafts. The production process is divided into more than ten steps, including material separation, planing, assembly, flower pulling, polishing, facing, painting, edging, and ring nailing. There are more than ten styles, such as concave holes, convex holes, three bundles, four bundles, five bundles, and lattice scenes. There are two sizes, six and a half inches and five and a half inches.

    武进特产白骨扇
    早在二千多年以前，江苏省武进县湖塘镇周围盛产牛骨制成的白扇骨，畅销在全国各地。三十年以前，艺人们又在扇骨上拉制精致的图案，穿上绢面，画上彩画。于是白骨扇就成了武进县的特产，远销在国际市场。
    解放后，全县近百个从业人员组织了生产合作社（或生产小组），产品的数量和质量大大提高了。苏联及人民民主国家和南洋各地都争来订购，今年计划出口三万多把，足可换回二百多吨钢材。
    白骨扇是特种手工艺制品，制作过程分开料、刨料、装配、拉花、磨光、糊面、绘画、沿边、钉环等十多道。它的式样有凹孔、凸孔、三束、四束、五束、格景等十多种。尺寸有六寸半和五寸半两种。
