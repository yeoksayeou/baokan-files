Wasted Effort

    Hallstein, the West German Deputy Foreign Minister, who has always been enthusiastic in running errands for the American "Cold War" policy, recently attacked the Chinese people wantonly at a luncheon meeting of the East Asian Association in Hamburg, and demanded that West German business and industry figures abide by the so-called "embargo" policy and not do business with China.

    In order to find arguments for his outrageous attitude, Hallstein also made a round of anti-communist clamoring, even going so far as to declare himself an "enemy" of the 600 million Chinese people. He said: "We must not forget that we must regard communism as the enemy... The embargo policy must also be viewed from this perspective."

    Hallstein's crude and unreasonable attack on communist countries and the Chinese people is clearly an attempt to raise the black flag of anti-communism to suppress the increasingly high voices in West Germany demanding trade with China. However, the effect of his approach was not wonderful. At that very luncheon, the chairman of the East Asia Association, Hein, stood up to speak against him, advocating the immediate cessation of the embargo policy against China. Hein's speech was greeted with applause from all 550 West German entrepreneurs present. Schwan, a member of the West German Free Democratic Party, also pointed out at a Free Democratic Party state representatives' meeting that influential businessmen expressed indignation at Hallstein's statement on continuing the embargo. Some West German newspapers also criticized Hallstein. The "Fulda People's Daily" asked in a mocking tone: Was Hallstein's speech out of "stupidity or blindness?"

    Hallstein's result of raising the black flag of anti-communism was that he smeared his own face with dirt. One must ask: Why did Hallstein bring this upon himself? The West German "All-German Alliance" press bulletin pointed out: Hallstein's speech primarily reflected Dulles's views. And the reason why Hallstein has to suffer is precisely because he only cares about looking at the expressions of his master in Washington, but forgot the reality before his eyes, which is that West German business and industry figures are eager to trade with China. Hein, the chairman of the West German East Asia Association, once said: When the decline in West German exports has already threatened the employment situation, West German industrial products must find a way out in China.

    The American embargo policy has increasingly been opposed by those countries that are forced to pursue it, because this policy primarily harms their interests. Therefore, the American policy is facing the prospect of collapse. In this situation, Hallstein stepped forward, wanting to independently support this bankrupt policy, which can only be a wasted effort. (Sheng) (Attached picture)

    枉费心机
    一向热心为美国“冷战”政策奔走的西德外交部副部长哈尔斯坦，最近在汉堡东亚协会的一次午餐会上，竟放肆地攻击中国人民，并要求西德工商界人士遵守所谓“禁运”政策，不要和中国做生意。
    为了给他自己的这种狂悖的态度寻找论据，哈尔斯坦还特别发了一通反共的叫嚣，甚至不惜把自己宣布为六亿中国人民的“敌人”。他说：“不可忘记，我们必须把共产主义当作敌人，……。对于禁运政策也必须从这种观点来看”。
    哈尔斯坦这样粗暴无理地攻击共产主义国家和中国人民，显然是企图扯起反共的这面黑旗，来压一压西德国内越来越高涨的要求和中国贸易的呼声。但是，他的这种做法所收到的效果却并不美妙。就在那一次午餐会上，东亚协会主席海因就起来发言反对他；海因主张立即停止对中国的禁运政策。海因的发言博得了全体到会的五百五十名西德企业家们的鼓掌欢迎。西德自由民主党议员施万在一次自由民主党州代表会议上也指出，有影响的商人对哈尔斯坦关于继续禁运的声明表示愤慨。西德的一些报纸也对哈尔斯坦加以指责。“孚尔达人民报”以嘲讽的口气问道：哈尔斯坦的谈话是出于“愚蠢还是盲目？”
    哈尔斯坦扯起反共黑旗的结果，是给自己抹了一鼻子的灰。人们要问：哈尔斯坦为什么要这样自讨没趣呢？西德“全德同盟”新闻公报指出：哈尔斯坦的演说首先反映了杜勒斯的观点。而哈尔斯坦之所以要倒霉也正是由于他只顾得到看华盛顿主子的眼色，而忘了眼前的现实，这个现实就是：西德的工商界人士急切地希望同中国进行贸易。西德东亚协会主席海因就曾说过：当西德的出口下降已经威胁到就业状况的时候，西德工业产品必须到中国去找出路。
    美国的禁运政策已日益遭受到那些被迫奉行这种政策的国家的反对，这是因为这种政策首先损害了它们的利益。因而，美国的这种政策已面临着崩溃的前景。在这种情况下，哈尔斯坦挺身而出，想来独力支撑这个破产的政策，这只能是枉费心机而已。　（生）（附图片）
