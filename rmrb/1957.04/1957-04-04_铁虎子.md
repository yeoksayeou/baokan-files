Tie Hu Zi (Iron Tiger)
Niu Pu

I finished two days of meetings at a university and am leaving tonight. In the evening, a truck was parked at the kitchen door, and the cooks were unloading grain. A short, stout young man, like an iron barrel, carried five bags of flour at a time, walking as fast as the wind. I was drawn to his powerful movements. After unloading the grain, he rolled up his sleeves, extended an arm like a steel pillar, and shouted to the other cooks, "Who's not convinced? Come on!"

They started arm wrestling.

Curiosity made me want to see how strong he really was. I walked closer to him and took a closer look, and couldn't help but exclaim, "Are you Tie Hu Zi?"

He immediately became as shy as a big girl, grabbed my hand tightly, and was so happy he didn't know what to do. He pulled me into their room to sit down. He said, "Sit down for a while, I need to study tomorrow's menu." After speaking, he left.

I picked up a small notebook on his bed. It read: "7th: Stir-fried Twice-Cooked Pork. Southerners ate it all, but Northerners left some. Northerners don't like spicy food. 8th Noon: Beef and Cabbage Noodles. Everyone ate it all up, everyone loves it, pay attention to making more of this." This notebook, like a small boat going with the current, carried me into a whirlpool of memories.

In my hometown, Tie Hu Zi was my neighbor, the only child of Aunt Zhang. I remember when I returned home three years ago, he was about to graduate from senior primary school. I asked him, "Tie Hu Zi, what are you going to do after graduation?"

"After graduation, I'll farm. Just find something to do."

"Go to school, you can go to college in the future."

He grinned and shook his head: "I'm too old, going to school isn't suitable. Everything is for building socialism."

An old cook came in, interrupting my thoughts. I quickly asked, "Is Zhang Tiehu doing well?"

"Yes, he is." The old cook talked to me endlessly: "When Tiehu first came here, I secretly asked him once: 'You graduated from primary school, you're young and strong, wouldn't it be better to learn a craft? Why learn to cook?' Guess what he said! 'Humph, cook?' He glared at me with his bun-like eyes, as if he was arguing with me: 'If students don't eat well, they can't study well, isn't that important? Tell me, who can live without eating?' I thought that was right. Now he's our team leader, and his prestige is very high."

The old cook paused and then said, "Tiger is also good at composing clapper talk. Every time after a meal, he goes to each table to check for waste. Once, at table seven, there were grains of rice everywhere, on and under the table, in the plates and bowls. When he saw it, he shouted, 'Good! The Party is calling on us to save food, and it can't touch your hearts?' He didn't clean up the table, but left it for everyone to see. At lunchtime, he broadcasted clapper talk in the dining hall:

Clapper boards, sound loud,
I'll criticize table seven's crowd,
Everyone else's table is clean, bowl is clean, floor is clean,
Only they scatter rice and buns all around,
Ask you, what are you thinking?
What do you think of the call to save?
Which student doesn't believe,
Quick, go to table seven for a viewing.

It really worked. Since then, there has been much less food waste. When Tiger walks to their table seven, the students shout to him: 'Check, check, how is it this time?'

Tiger grinned: 'Okay, no clapper talk this time!'"

The old cook finished speaking, and Tie Hu Zi came in. He had taken off his white work clothes, and the first thing he asked was: "You've eaten here for two days, do you have any opinions?"

I told him that I was very satisfied.

He asked again, "How's the taste? Do others have any opinions?"

I was embarrassed by his questions, because I hadn't paid attention to these things at all.

It was time to go to the station. I asked him if he wanted to send a letter home, because I was going home on the way.

He pulled out a heavy package from under the bed: "I'm sending these books to the cooperative, please take them."

I asked, "Do you have a letter to send to Aunt Zhang?"

He thought for a moment and said, "There's nothing to say, the money has already been sent. Tell my mother, don't rush my marriage, I'm still young."

I saw his cheeks, red like sunset clouds, and joked, "Tie Hu Zi, have you found someone outside!"

He stammered, "No--no, but at twenty-five, I'm not getting married."

He sent me a long way, and we talked about the changes in our hometown, the future of our hometown, and the happy life that attracts us. We parted, and I walked towards the station, shouting to him from a distance: "Tie--Hu--Zi, your job won't change, will it? I'll write a letter..."

"Just send the letter here, I want to do it for another ten years, a lifetime of doing this job."

    铁虎子
    牛朴
    我在一所高等学校开完了两天会，今天夜里就要走了。傍晚，厨房门口停着一辆卡车，厨工们正往下搬运粮食，有一个像铁桶似的又矮又粗的小伙子，一次背了五袋面，走起路来还像阵风，我被他这有力的动作吸引住了。搬完粮食，他袖子一挽，伸出钢柱似的一只手臂，对别的厨工叫道：“谁不服，来一个！”
    他们掰起腕来。
    好奇心使我想看看他力气到底有多大。我走近他仔细一看，不禁惊叫出来：“你是铁虎子？”
    他马上腼腆得像个大姑娘，用力拉住我的手，高兴得不知怎么好，他拉我到他们屋里去坐。他说：“先坐一会儿，我要去研究明天的饭菜单。”说完就走了。
    我顺便在他床上拿起一个小本，上面写着：“七日，炒回锅肉，南方人都吃完了，北方人倒剩下了，北方人不愿吃辣的。八日中午：牛肉白菜粉，都吃得一干二净，大家都爱吃，注意多做这个。”这个小本像一叶顺水而下的小舟把我渡到回忆的漩涡里去了。
    在故乡，铁虎子是我的邻居，张大娘的独根苗。记得三年前我回家的时候，他正要高小毕业。我问他：“铁虎子毕了业干什么？”
    “毕了业种地，不就找个事。” 
    “升学吧，将来还可以上大学。”
    他嘿嘿地笑着摇摇头：“我岁数大了，升学不合适，干什么都是建设社会主义呀。”
    一个老厨工进来，把我的思路打断了。我赶紧问：“张铁虎干得不错吧？”
    “不错。”老厨工滔滔不绝地向我谈起来：“铁虎刚来到这里，有一次我偷偷问他：‘你小学毕了业，年轻力壮的，学点手艺不好？怎么学作饭？’你猜他怎么说！‘哼，作饭？’他瞪着包子似的两眼，像是跟我吵架：‘学生吃不好饭就上不好课，这不重要？你说，谁不吃饭能活着？’我一听这话对呀，现在他是我们组长，威望可高哪。”
    老厨工停了停又说：“虎子还会编快板哪，每次吃完饭他要去各桌检查一下有无浪费。有一次第七桌那里桌上桌下，盘里碗里都是饭粒子。他一看就叫起来：‘好啊！党号召我们节约粮食，就打动不了你们的心？’他没有收拾这个桌子，留着让大家看看。中午吃饭的时候，他在饭厅广播起快板来：
    竹板打，响连天，
    我把七桌表一番，
    人家都是桌净、碗净、地下净，
    唯有他们米饭馒头到处撒，
    问问你们是啥思想？
    你们对节约号召怎么看？
    哪个同学不相信，
    快到七桌去参观。
    真灵，从那次以后，浪费粮食现象少多了，虎子一走到他们七桌，同学们就喊他：‘检查检查这次怎么样？’
    虎子咧着大嘴笑了：‘行啊，上不了快板啦。’”
    老厨工讲到这里，铁虎子进来了，他已脱去白工作服，开头第一句就问：“你在我们这里吃了两天饭有什么意见没有？”
    我告诉他，非常满意。
    他又问：“口味怎么样？别人有什么意见？”
    我被他问的窘住了，因为我根本没注意这些。
    上车站时间到了，问他往家捎信否？因为这次我要顺便回家一趟。
    他从床底下掏出一个沉甸甸的包裹：“这些书我送给合作社的，你给带上吧。”
    我问：“给张大娘有信捎吗？”
    他想了想说：“没什么事了，钱已经寄走了。你告诉我娘，对我的亲事甭着急，我还年轻呢。”
    我看到他彩霞似的两颊，打趣地说：“铁虎子在外边搞上对象了吧！”
    他口吃起来：“没——没有，不过二十五岁，我不结婚。”
    他送了我很远，我们谈到家乡的变化，家乡的未来，幸福的生活吸引着我们。分别了，我往车站方向走去，我走了一段不住喊他：“铁——虎——子，你的工作不会变吧，我写信……”
      “写信就寄这里吧，我要再干十年，一辈子干这个工作。”
