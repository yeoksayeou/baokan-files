Shaoxing Wine Gets Better With Age

    (Our report) Expansion work has begun at the Shaoxing Winery in Zhejiang. The expansion project includes production workshops for fermentation and steaming, as well as storage warehouses. These projects are expected to be completed by October this year.

    After these newly expanded workshops and equipment are put into production, they can produce about 4,000 tons of yellow wine and white wine annually. At the same time, due to the expansion of the wine storage cellar, more aged wine can be stored each year, so as to restore the characteristic of the famous Shaoxing wine that "the older it gets, the better it tastes."

    绍兴酒越陈越香
    本报讯　浙江绍兴酒厂的扩建工程已经开始。扩建工程有发酵、蒸制等生产厂房和储酒仓库等。这些工程预计在今年10月即可完工。
    这批扩建的厂房和设备投入生产后，可年产黄酒、白酒四千吨左右。同时由于贮酒库的扩大，每年将可储存更多的陈酒，以恢复绍兴名酒“越陈越香”的特色。
