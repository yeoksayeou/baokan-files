Liu Huifang, a worker's family member living in Xiaoju Lane, Hankou, is skilled at saving fabric. The clothes worn by her four children are almost all made from alterations of the adults' old clothes. Her grandfather had an old black robe with a worn-out middle, but the other parts were still sturdy, so she cut off the worn part and used the hem and lower body to make a padded Zhongshan suit for her eleven-year-old son. She also made a small cotton-padded jacket for her three-year-old daughter, which looks almost new. She pieced together her husband's worn-out trousers, piece by piece, and remade them into two small pairs of overalls that were about a foot long. The three-year-old daughter is now wearing a set of padded clothes that were altered from the eldest daughter's old clothes. She has already worn them for two winters, and according to Liu Huifang, they can be worn for another winter. Her own clothes are also mostly made from altered old-fashioned robes. She has dozens of clothes made from old clothes readily available. Her family has two large bedsheets that have been used for more than ten years. The middle part was torn, so she cut out the middle and sewed the sturdy parts on both sides together to make two small bedsheets for her eldest daughter. If the binding strips torn from old clothes are still sturdy, she keeps them to make washcloths and never spends money to buy them. She keeps all the scraps of fabric to mend clothes, bind shoe openings, make straps, etc., and never wastes them.

Because she values saving fabric, even though there are many people in her family, they only add new clothes every two or three years. Her family can save at least six or seven zhang of fabric each year (assuming each of the seven family members buys one set of clothes per year). Last year, her husband, Lao Lin, received a raise, and the family added twenty or thirty new clothes and bought a new quilt cover. When she heard that cotton production had decreased last year and that the country was having difficulty supplying cotton cloth this year, she said that even though their life has improved, they must continue to save fabric. She said, "Saving fabric is not only to reduce the country's difficulties, but also to help ourselves live frugally and develop good habits. This summer, I originally planned to add two sets of single-layer clothes for everyone, but now I will only add two sets of single-layer clothes for the older children and grandfather, because their original single-layer clothes are torn and patched and can no longer be worn. The others will alter some old clothes to wear and will no longer buy fabric to make new single-layer clothes." She smiled and continued, "Even so, we buy more new clothes in a year than we bought in the several years before liberation. Before liberation, I had been in the Lin family for six or seven years and was still wearing the clothes I made when I got married, and the two children mostly wore our old clothes."

    刘惠芳是节约用布的能手
    张碨
    住在汉口小居巷的职工家属刘惠芳，是一个节约用布的能手。她家四个孩子穿的衣服，差不多都是利用大人的旧衣服改的。爷爷有一件黑色的旧长袍，中间磨破了，其他的地方都还结实，她就把破的部分剪下来，利用下摆和下身给十一岁的儿子改了一件夹的中山服，还给三岁的女儿改了一件小棉袄，看起来和新的差不多。她把爱人穿破了的裤子，一块一块的拼接起来，改制成两件尺把长的小背带裤。三岁的女儿现在穿的一身棉衣棉裤，还是大女儿的旧衣服改的，已穿了两个冬天，据刘惠芳说还可以再穿一冬。她自己的衣服，也多是用旧式长袍改做的。她利用旧衣服改成的衣服，放在手边的就有好几十件。她家有两条已用了十多年的大床单，中间破了，她就把中间的剪了，把两边结实的部分又缝接起来，改成两条小床单给大女儿用。旧衣服撕下来的贴边如还结实，她就留着扎洗把用，自己从不花钱去买洗把。所有的碎布角角，她都留着补衣服、滚鞋口、作带子等用，从不浪费。
    因为她重视节省用布，所以家里人口虽多，总是隔二、三年才添置一次新衣服。她家每年最少能节约用布六、七丈（一家七口人以每人每年买一身衣服计算）。去年，她爱人老林增加了工资，一家大小共添了二、三十件衣服，还买了一床新被面。当她听说去年棉花减产，今年国家供应棉布有困难时，她就表示现在生活虽然改善了，但还要继续节省用布。她说：“节约用布，一方面是为了减少国家的困难，一方面也能帮助自己勤俭过日子，养成良好的习惯。今年夏天，我本来准备给每人添两件单衣穿的，现在只给大孩子和爷爷添两件单衣服，因为他们原来的单衣都破了又补，实在不能再穿了，其他的人改些旧的穿，都不再买布做新的单衣。”她笑了笑接着又说：“就这样，我们一年买的新衣服，也比解放前几年间买的衣服多。解放前，我到林家六、七年都还穿着结婚时做的衣服，两个孩子也多是穿我们的旧衣服。”
