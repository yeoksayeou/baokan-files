Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, April 3rd (Xinhua reporters Ai Changqing and Shu Ti report): Starting in January, Tianjin, one of China's largest industrial cities, has launched a vigorous campaign to increase production and practice economy. Over the past quarter, this campaign has achieved good results. According to relevant estimates, more than 80% of the city's factories and 90% of its workers have participated in the campaign. As a result, the completion of the plan in the first quarter of this year was better than in any previous period. For example, the Heavy Industry Bureau is expected to complete 106.73% of its output value plan, reduce the cost reduction rate from 4.99% to 5.85%, and complete 110.89% of its profit plan. The output value and profit increased by 47% and 288.23% respectively compared with the same period last year.

This year's campaign to increase production and practice economy was launched under extremely difficult circumstances. At the beginning, the industrial departments in Tianjin lacked sufficient confidence. On the one hand, they believed that production potential had been exhausted after years of increasing production and practicing economy; on the other hand, they emphasized the lack of raw materials, saying that even a clever housewife cannot cook without rice. However, over the past three months, after mobilizing the masses, exposing waste, and putting forward rationalization proposals for increasing production and practicing economy, most of the difficulties have been resolved. When the Tianjin Municipal Planning Commission required the five industrial bureaus of local industry to increase output value by 10% and reduce costs by 6%, each bureau said it could not achieve it, and some even asked to increase costs. However, after mobilizing the masses for discussion, except for the cost item, the output value of two bureaus exceeded the target, the output value of three bureaus basically reached the target, and the profits of all bureaus exceeded the target. According to the statistics of thirteen factories whose plans for this year have been determined among the forty-two state-owned industrial units, this year's output value will increase by 7.2% compared with last year, and the output of twenty-one kinds of products will increase.

At present, the stage of mobilizing the masses to expose waste and put forward measures has basically ended, and it has begun to enter the stage of competition. Judging from the situation in the previous stage, the ways to increase production and practice economy in Tianjin's industrial departments are extremely broad. There are many ways, ranging from improving product design and changing process regulations to reducing the consumption of raw materials and using substitutes. The Electromechanical Industry Bureau alone, after mobilizing the masses to find solutions, can save 2,000 tons of steel and 420 tons of miscellaneous copper for the whole bureau, which is equivalent to 10% of the annual demand. The bridge crane with a lifting capacity of one ton and a span of eleven meters produced by the Lifting Machinery Factory originally weighed 1,800 kilograms in the structural part per unit. After changing the design, each unit can save 440 kilograms of steel. Therefore, the materials originally used to manufacture three units can now be used to manufacture four units. The 1615 lathe produced by the Machine Tool Factory originally weighed 850 kilograms per unit. After improving the process regulations and operating methods, each unit can save 41 kilograms of steel and 56 kilograms of pig iron. The steel and pig iron saved throughout the year can be used to produce 31 more forged parts for machine tools and 22 more cast parts for machine tools. The Tianjin No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory uses 15% of flax waste to replace cotton. Compared with the amount of cotton used last year, it can save 1.14 million catties of cotton. The workers of the Tianjin Bicycle Factory focus on saving every bit of material when cutting materials, and can save 250 tons of steel throughout the year, which can be used to make 10,000 more bicycles. The Tianjin Printing and Dyeing Factory used to use 11 kilograms of coal to print and dye one piece of cloth, but now it has been reduced to 7 kilograms. Based on the calculation of dyeing 3,000 pieces of cloth per day, 12 tons of coal can be saved every day. The consumption of caustic soda has also decreased by 30% compared with last year. All of these show that Tianjin's industry has enormous potential. Three characteristics:

	Combining the fight against bureaucracy and mobilizing the masses; working together from top to bottom to overcome difficulties; carrying out extensive collaboration.

Combining the fight against bureaucracy and mobilizing the masses is an important feature of this year's campaign to increase production and practice economy. Directors of industrial bureaus, managers of companies, and directors of factories all go deep into the masses to solve specific problems and help grassroots units mobilize the masses. The director and party secretary of the No. 3 State-owned Cotton Mill, due to their bureaucratic style and detachment from the masses, dared not meet with the masses at the beginning of the campaign. As a result, the longer the time was delayed, the more opinions the masses had. Later, under the promotion of the bureau, they made self-criticisms to the masses, which greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses and put forward measures to increase production and practice economy. The second characteristic of the campaign is that everyone works together from top to bottom to overcome difficulties. The supply of steel and coke in the electromechanical industry is insufficient, so engineering and technical personnel actively study and change the design and use anthracite coal instead of coke to melt iron; sales personnel also go to Shanxi and other places to find raw materials everywhere. The raw iron that the sales personnel of the Internal Combustion Engine Factory found sporadically in the rural areas of Shanxi Province is now enough for them to produce for half a year. The personnel of the science and technology department of many factories also take the initiative to go out to undertake tasks and trial-produce new products with less materials, high output value, and high quality. Even Zhu Qingzhun, the chief engineer of Tianjin Tractor Manufacturing Plant, went to other places to undertake tasks, which increased the utilization of production capacity by 70%. The workers paid attention to saving every bit of material everywhere. In the leather industry, workers used to use paper patterns and pencils to cut leather shoe soles. Because the pencil was thick, the cut soles were always larger than the patterns. They used iron patterns and iron pens to cut them. In this way, more than 10,000 catties of various soles can be saved throughout the year. Extensive collaboration in the industrial system is the third characteristic of the campaign. In the past month, all sixty-seven factories of the Electrical Appliance Industry Company have been organized, and a weekly meeting system for mutual adjustment of raw materials has been established among twenty-two major electrical appliance factories, so that the production of each factory can proceed smoothly. Many electromechanical factories have also mutually adjusted the production tasks of more than 200,000 pieces of products, achieving a balance between full and empty capacity. Some factories have insufficient strength in equipment maintenance, and factories with surplus production capacity help them maintain equipment and modify machines. Several wool textile factories and printing and dyeing factories in Tianjin have also signed technical collaboration contracts. Several problems:

	The development of the campaign is not balanced enough; individual factories neglect quality; the phenomenon of "gust of wind" has begun to be exposed.

However, there are still several issues worth noting in Tianjin's campaign to increase production and practice economy. First of all, the development of the campaign is not balanced enough, so that although many factories have entered the competition stage, some factories have not yet started the first stage of work. And the factories entering the competition are also uneven. Among the ninety-three factories in Nankai District, only forty-four factories have launched competitions, forty-four factories are preparing to launch competitions, and five factories are not yet prepared. Among the one hundred and sixty-one factories in Hebei District, only three factories have launched competitions. This imbalance is also reflected between the masses and leaders or between workers and science and technology personnel within a factory. In some factories, the masses have been mobilized, but the work of the science and technology personnel cannot keep up, so the workers in some factories said, "Competition, competition, the science and technology department is outside"! This makes it impossible to implement some measures even though they have been proposed. Secondly, although most factories have attached importance to product quality in the campaign to increase production and practice economy, individual factories have a tendency to neglect quality. For example, among the forty comparable products of Tianjin Textile Industry Bureau in January and February, the quality of as many as fifteen products declined. The North China Soap Factory changed its formula and put it into production without testing, resulting in discoloration of the soap and a backlog of 13,000 yuan in funds. The state requires that the proportion of first-class and second-class products of enamel products reach 50%, but the proportion of first-class and second-class products produced by North China Enamel Factory has been declining since February. The reason is that in addition to the lack of borax in the raw materials, resulting in dull colors, it is also due to insufficient effort. Weidi's Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory did not grasp the key issues in increasing production and practicing economy, but instead studied packaging issues, resulting in high rework rates for analgesics and baking soda. Thirdly, the phenomenon of "gust of wind" has also begun to be exposed in some units. For example, some factories consider it complete after implementing some simple measures that have been proposed. Some factories have not organized forces to seriously implement some measures proposed by the masses, which seems a bit slack. In addition, some factories only have indicators but no specific plans when launching competitions, or the factory drafted a few guarantee conditions, and the groups copied these few conditions as they were, and even the same conditions were used as last year.

    天津市工业蕴藏着巨大的潜力
    增产节约的途径极其广阔
    第一季度完成计划的情况比过去任何时期都好
    新华社天津3日电　新华社记者艾长青、舒倜报道：从1月份开始，我国最大的工业城市之一——天津市的增产节约运动就已经蓬勃展开了。一个季度来，这一运动已经收到良好的效果。据有关方面估计，全市已经有80％以上的工厂、90％的职工投入了运动。因而今年第一季度完成计划的情况也比以往任何时期要好。如重工业局预计完成产值计划106.73％，成本降低率由4.99％降低到5.85％，利润计划完成了110.89％，产值和利润比去年同期增长47％和288.23％。
    今年的增产节约运动是在极其困难的情况下开展的。开始的时候，天津市的工业部门都缺乏足够的信心。一方面，认为年年增产节约，生产潜力已经挖尽；另方面又强调原材料缺乏，巧妇难为无米之炊。但三个月来，经过发动群众，揭发浪费，提出增产节约合理化建议，绝大部分困难都获得了解决。地方工业的五个工业局，在天津市计划委员会要求提高产值10％、降低成本6％的时候，各局都说达不到，有的反而要求提高成本。但经发动群众讨论，除成本一项以外，产值有两个局超过，三个局基本达到，利润都超过了指标。国营工业四十二个单位中据已经确定今年计划的十三个工厂统计，今年的产值将比去年增加7.2％，有二十一种产品将要增产。
    目前，发动群众揭发浪费提出措施的阶段已经基本结束，开始步入竞赛的阶段。从前一阶段的情况看来，天津市工业部门增产节约的途径是极其广阔的。大者如改进产品设计、改变工艺规程，小者如减少原材料的消耗、利用代用品等等，都有很多办法。仅机电工业局一个局经过发动群众想办法，全局就可以节约钢材两千吨，杂铜四百二十吨，相当全年需要量10％。起重机械厂所产起重能力一吨、跨度十一公尺的桥式起重机，原来每台的结构部分重一千八百公斤，改变设计以后，每台可以节约钢材四百四十公斤，因而原来制造三台的材料，现在就可以制造四台。机床厂生产的一六一五车床原来每台重量八百五十公斤，经过改进工艺规程和操作方法，每台可以节省四十一公斤钢材、五十六公斤生铁。全年节约的钢材和生铁，可以多生产三十一台机床的锻件和二十二台机床的铸件。天津第六棉纺织厂用15％的亚麻下脚代替棉花，同去年用棉量相比较，就可以节约一百一十四万斤棉花，天津自行车厂的职工在下料的时候从一毫一丝着眼，全年可以节约二百五十吨钢材，可以多做一万辆自行车。天津印染厂过去印染一匹布用煤十一公斤，现在减到七公斤，以每天染三千匹布计算，每天可以节约十二吨煤。火碱消耗量也比去年降低30％。所有这些，都说明天津工业蕴藏着巨大的潜在力量。三个特点：
    结合反官僚主义，发动群众；上下一齐动手克服困难；开展广泛的协作。
    结合反官僚主义发动群众是今年增产节约运动的重要特点。工业局的局长、公司的经理、工厂的厂长都深入到群众中解决具体问题，帮助基层单位发动群众。国棉三厂厂长和党委书记由于存在官僚主义作风，脱离群众，在运动之初，不敢同群众见面，结果拖延时间愈久，群众意见愈多；后来在局的推动下向群众作了检讨，大大鼓舞了群众的积极性，提出了增产节约的措施。运动中的第二个特点是上下一齐动手克服困难。机电工业的钢材、焦炭供应不足，工程技术人员们就积极研究改变设计，用无烟煤代替焦炭化铁；供销人员也到山西等地到处寻找原材料。内燃机厂的供销人员在山西省的农村，零星找来的生铁，现在已经够他们生产半年之用。许多工厂的科室人员还主动出外承揽任务，试制用料少、产值大、质量高的新产品。天津拖拉机制造厂连总工程师朱清准也去外地承揽任务，使生产能力的利用增加了70％，工人们更是处处注意点滴节约。皮革工业的工人们过去划皮鞋底用纸样板和铅笔，因为铅笔较粗，划出的底皮总比样板大，他们就用铁样板和铁笔来划。这样，全年就可以节约各种底皮一万多斤。在工业系统中，开展广泛的协作是运动的第三个特点。在过去的一个月中，电器工业公司的六十七个工厂，全部组织了起来，在二十二个主要的电器工厂之间，建立了每周一次互相调剂原材料的会议制度，使各厂的生产都能顺利进行。很多机电工厂还相互调剂了二十多万件产品的生产任务，做到了饱饥相济。有些工厂设备检修的力量不足，生产能力有富余的工厂就帮助他们检修设备，改装机器。天津的几个毛纺织厂和印染厂还分别签订了技术协作合同。几个问题：
    运动发展不够平衡；个别工厂忽视质量；“一阵风”的现象开始暴露。
    但是，天津市的增产节约运动也还有几个值得注意的问题。首先是运动的发展还不够平衡，以致目前虽然有不少的工厂已经进入竞赛阶段，但也有些厂还没有开始第一阶段工作。而进入竞赛的工厂也不平衡。南开区九十三个工厂，现在已经开展竞赛的仅四十四个厂，准备开展竞赛的有四十四个厂，还没有准备的有五个厂。河北区一百六十一个厂已经开展竞赛的仅三个厂。这种不平衡，还表现在一个厂内的群众和领导之间或工人和科室、技术人员之间。有的厂群众已经发动起来，但科室人员的工作跟不上去，所以有的厂的工人说，“竞赛、竞赛，科室在外”！这样就使得有些措施虽然提出了但不能实现。其次，在增产节约运动中，虽然一般工厂都重视了产品质量，但也有个别的工厂有忽视质量的倾向。如天津市纺织工业局1—2两个月份四十种可比产品中质量下降的即达十五种。华北造胰厂因为改变配方，未经试验即投入生产，以致香皂变色，积压了一万三千元资金。搪瓷产品，国家要求甲乙级品达到50％，但华北搪瓷厂生产的甲乙级品自2月以后即趋下降。其原因除了由于原料中缺乏硼砂以致色泽不鲜以外，也由于努力不够。伟迪氏化学制药厂在增产节约中没有抓住关键问题，而去研究包装问题，以致镇痛片和小苏打的返工率都很高。第三是“一阵风”的现象也在某些单位开始暴露出来。如有的工厂把提出的一些简单的措施实现以后，也就算完了。也有一些工厂对群众提出的一些措施没有组织力量去认真贯彻，显得有些松劲。还有一些工厂在开展竞赛的时候，只有指标没有具体方案，或者厂里起草了几条保证条件，小组也就照样抄这几条，甚至还有去年是那几条，今年还是那样几条的现象。
