Xinhua News Agency, 31st dispatch: "Be an excellent Communist Youth League member!" This is the slogan that the Third Congress of Peking University Communist Youth League Members, which concluded today, proposed to the more than six thousand six hundred Communist Youth League members, who account for 78% of the total number of students and faculty members of the university.

The meeting, in view of the fact that some Communist Youth League members have shown a vague stance on some major political issues; many Communist Youth League members hold the view of "family first, then the Party" (i.e., become an expert first and then join the Communist Party), a purely professional view divorced from politics; some pursue a "peaceful" and "comfortable" life; and some have a weak sense of organization; focused on discussing issues such as "What does the title of Communist Youth League member mean?" and "What kind of person should a Communist Youth League member ultimately become?"

The meeting held that Communist Youth League members should always maintain vigorous revolutionary vigor and political ambition, actively participate in revolutionary practice activities, and strive to learn Marxism-Leninism and professional knowledge, and unite the two. Communist Youth League members should regard their labor and struggle as part of the great revolutionary cause, and make their actions always subordinate to the highest interests of the revolution; fight against all non-proletarian thoughts, and continuously improve themselves politically first.

The congress pointed out that as a member of a revolutionary organization, Communist Youth League members should always maintain the ideological and action unity of the revolutionary organization and fight to consolidate the revolutionary organization.

    “作一个优秀的共青团员”
    青年团北京大学团员代表大会提出奋斗目标
    据新华社31日讯　“作一个优秀的共产主义青年团员！”这是青年团北京大学第三次团员代表大会在今天结束的会议上，向占全校学生和教职员工总人数78％的六千六百多个青年团员提出的口号。
    会议针对着有的青年团员在一些重大政治问题上表现了立场模糊；不少团员抱着“先家后党”（即先当了专家然后参加共产党）的脱离政治的单纯钻业务的观点；有的追求“平静”、“安逸”的生活；有的存在着组织观念薄弱等不良倾向；着重讨论了“青年团员的称号意味着什么？”“青年团员究竟应该成为甚么样的人”等问题。
    会议认为，青年团员应该永远保持蓬勃的革命朝气和政治进取心，积极参加革命的实践活动，努力学习马克思列宁主义和专业知识，并把这两者统一起来。青年团员应该将自己的劳动和斗争看作是伟大革命事业的一部分，要使自己的行动永远服从于革命的最高利益；向一切非无产阶级思想作斗争、永不停滞的首先在政治上提高自己。
    代表大会指出，青年团员作为革命组织的一个成员，就要经常保持革命组织在思想上和行动上的一致，为巩固革命组织而斗争。
