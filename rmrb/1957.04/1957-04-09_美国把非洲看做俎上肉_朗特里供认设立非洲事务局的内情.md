    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 8th: Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern, South Asian, and African Affairs, Rountree, recently stated at a meeting of the House Appropriations Committee that the United States should view Africa as "a center for the struggle between the free world and international communism."
    Rountree was testifying before the Appropriations Committee regarding the State Department's plan to establish a new Bureau of African Affairs. He said that the State Department wants to establish a Bureau of African Affairs for three reasons: (1) The economic, political, and social development of Africa is of increasing importance. (2) The importance of Africa to the United States. (3) The growing necessity to oppose the unfriendly forces that are developing in Africa to a serious degree.
    He said that we already have many important bases in African countries, and we depend on Africa for a large amount of resources. For example, we are currently obtaining large amounts of uranium and cobalt from the Congo and the Union of South Africa; copper, chromium, and manganese from the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland; lead from Morocco and the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland and French Equatorial Africa; bauxite from the Gold Coast; industrial diamonds from the Congo and the Union of South Africa; and rubber from Liberia and the Congo.

    美国把非洲看做俎上肉
    朗特里供认设立非洲事务局的内情
    新华社8日讯　华盛顿消息：美国负责近东、南亚和非洲事务的助理国务卿朗特里最近在众议院拨款委员会会议上说，美国应当把非洲看作“自由世界与国际共产主义作斗争的一个中心”。
    朗特里是为国务院计划成立一个新的非洲事务局而在拨款委员会作证的，他说，国务院要设立一个非洲事务局有三个理由：（一）非洲的经济、政治和社会的发展具有愈来愈重大的意义。（二）非洲对美国的重要性。（三）反对正在全非以严重程度发展的不友好的势力的必要性日益增长。
    他说，我们在非洲各国已有许多重要的基地，我们对非洲大量的资源有所依赖。举例说，目前我们正从刚果和南非联邦得到大量的铀和钴。从中非联邦得到铜、铬和锰以及从摩洛哥和中非联邦及法属赤道非洲得到铅，从黄金海岸得到铁矾土，从刚果和南非联邦得到工业用的钻石以及从利比里亚和刚果得到橡胶。
