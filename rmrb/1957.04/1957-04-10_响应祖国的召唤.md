    Responding to the Call of the Motherland
    After reading the People's Daily editorial "On the Issue of Middle and Primary School Graduates Participating in Agricultural Production," the more than fifty fiery hearts in Class 5 of the third grade at Beijing Experimental Middle School were set ablaze. After singing the song "Going to Life," a girl stepped onto the podium to read the editorial. After the editorial was read, the students all requested to talk about their inner thoughts. Thus, a small forum began.
    Some students said, "This isn't directed at us city students. Our homes aren't in the countryside, so how can we participate in production?" Zhou Xiaoli said, "I disagree with your statement. This is directed at all middle and primary school graduates nationwide. I think that even if your home isn't in the countryside, you can join a reclamation team." She was a little excited and paused for a moment before saying, "If I don't get into high school, I'll join a volunteer reclamation team and strive for a great agricultural harvest this year." Song Weijia said, "If I really don't get into high school, I'll go wherever the motherland needs me!" A student next to her said:
  "We've figured everything out ourselves, now we need to convince the adults." Her words resonated with the students. Everyone scrambled to say: We must convince our parents. Some students also said: "It's really embarrassing to not get into school, it's a real pity that our ideals can't be realized!" Du Xingzhi excitedly said, "We should consider our ideals and aspirations based on the actual needs of the country. If we can't go to school and participate in labor production, that's also for the construction of the motherland, so what's embarrassing or regrettable about that?"
    At the forum, the students unanimously agreed that whether they go to school or participate in labor production, they can both further improve their knowledge level. At the same time, they recognized that the ideas of looking down on agricultural labor and despising farmers are wrong. Everyone expressed that they would resolutely advance in the direction pointed out by the Party, be good sons and daughters of the people, and go wherever the people need them.

    响应祖国的召唤
    北京实验中学初三级五班的同学们，看了人民日报“关于中小学毕业生参加农业生产问题”的社论后，这班五十多颗火热的心沸腾起来了。她们唱完了“走向生活”的歌曲以后，一个姑娘走上讲台朗读这篇社论。社论读完以后，同学们都要求谈一谈自己的内心话，于是，一个小型的座谈会就开始了。
    有的同学说：“这不是对我们城市的学生说的，我们的家不在农村，怎能参加生产呢？”周笑莉说：“我不同意你的说法。这是对我们全国所有的中小学毕业生说的话，我认为家不在农村，可参加垦荒队。”她有点激动，停了一会说，“要是我考不上高中，我就参加志愿垦荒队，争取今年的农业大丰收。”宋薇笳说：“要真的考不上高中，祖国需要我到那里去，我就到那里去！”在她旁边的一个同学说：
  “我们什么都想得通了，还要打通大人们的思想。”她的话引起了同学们的共鸣。大家都争着说：要给父母打通思想。还有的同学说：“考不上学校真丢人，理想实现不了真遗憾！”杜杏之激动地说：“我们应该根据国家实际的需要来考虑自己的理想和志愿，不能升学，参加劳动生产，也是为了祖国建设，那有什么丢人和遗憾的呢？”
    座谈会上，同学们一致认为，不管是升学，还是参加劳动生产，都同样可以进一步提高自己的知识水平；同时认识到那些轻视农业劳动和看不起农民的思想是错误的。大家都表示，坚决向着党所指引的方向迈进，做人民的好儿女，到人民需要的地方去。
