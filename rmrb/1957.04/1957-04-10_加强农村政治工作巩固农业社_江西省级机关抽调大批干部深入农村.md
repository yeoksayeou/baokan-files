    Strengthen Rural Political Work to Consolidate Agricultural Cooperatives
    Large Numbers of Cadres Drawn from Jiangxi Provincial Organs to Go Deep into Rural Areas
    (Our report) Nanchang – The spring plowing production campaign in Jiangxi Province has unfolded vigorously throughout the province. To strengthen grassroots leadership and further improve spring plowing production, creating a good start for striving for a bumper agricultural harvest this year, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has drawn thirteen cadres at the level of director and deputy director of provincial departments and deputy ministers of the provincial party committee, more than one hundred cadres at the level of section chief and division chief, and four hundred and thirty-seven general cadres from provincial-level organs to form six work groups. These groups will go deep into the rural areas of the Gan Nan Administrative Region and various special districts to carry out work. Before their departure, Yang Shangkun, First Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Shao Shiping, Governor of Jiangxi Province, Fang Zichun, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, and other responsible comrades explained the work methods and specific tasks to the work groups. Their main tasks are: to do everything possible to strive for a bumper harvest this year; to strengthen political and ideological work in rural areas; and to consolidate agricultural production cooperatives. To do a good job, the responsible comrades also asked the comrades of the work groups to pay attention to the following points: they must not be given special treatment in life and must share joys and sorrows with local cadres and the masses; they must respect the leadership of local party and government organs, modestly learn from the masses, and prevent arrogance and complacency; they must unite well with local cadres and learn from each other; they must abide by mass discipline; and they must maintain close ties with the masses. The comrades of the work groups unanimously stated: We will resolutely implement the party's policies, abide by government decrees, carry forward the party's glorious tradition of hard work and plain living, and complete the tasks assigned by the party and the people. Currently, all work groups have successively departed. (Zhou Qingyang)
