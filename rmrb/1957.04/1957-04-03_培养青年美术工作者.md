    Cultivating Young Art Workers
    One of the most noteworthy phenomena in China's art creation in recent years is the rapid growth of new forces. The ranks of young art workers are expanding, their creative output accounts for a large proportion of the art world, and their creative level is constantly improving, with excellent works appearing frequently. The National Youth Art Workers' Exhibition, jointly sponsored by the Ministry of Culture, the Youth League, and the Artists Association, provides strong evidence of this.
    Among the more than nine hundred works exhibited this time, there are over eight hundred young authors, many of whom are emerging newcomers, and some are amateur art workers and young art workers from fraternal ethnic groups. They are distributed in various regions of the country and various cultural work posts, and they have taken great strides on the road of art creation with full enthusiasm and strong perseverance. Whether in various categories of art creation, or in terms of the ideological content and artistic expression techniques of the works, there has been significant progress compared with the works in the early days of the national liberation. Through this exhibition, we can see the infinite potential of young art workers in creation.
    Our country is now in an era of great socialist transformation and construction, and the face of social life and the spiritual outlook of the people have undergone unprecedented changes. When artists express life, they not only need creative artistic talent, but also a sensitivity to discover new things, otherwise it will be difficult to create works with artistic charm that can reflect the spirit of the times. In this exhibition of works by young art workers, it can be seen that the authors have this sensitivity. Many of their works reflect the changes in social life, the upsurge of national construction to get rid of economic backwardness, the rise of spiritual life breaking through outdated concepts, and the beauty of life, labor, and ideological emotions emerging in the ever-changing world, thus making people feel a strong sense of life and the atmosphere of the times. Although many works are not profound and mature enough in ideological content and artistic expression, these are inevitable shortcomings of young art workers in the early stages of creation, which can be gradually overcome in the practice of life and creation.
    In recent years, the art world has made preliminary gains in carrying forward the fine traditions of national art, especially in the application of folk art forms. Due to the widespread promotion of art popularization work, folk-style art works have established a relatively solid foundation in the cultural life of the masses. This fact can be proved from the large number of published New Year pictures, serial pictures, and so on. This achievement is also inseparable from the great efforts of young art workers. From the New Year pictures and serial pictures exhibited this time, it can be seen that young art workers have made significant gains in learning folk art, and the achievements of serial pictures are particularly obvious. Some authors have shown outstanding talent in creation, some works have shown a high degree of skill in artistic expression, and the level of general works has also been greatly improved compared with the past. This situation proves that "art must be combined with the broad masses of the people" and "artists must obtain excellent results from hard work" are irrefutable truths. As long as young art workers make unremitting efforts to adhere to the policy of serving the broad masses of the people through art, and adhere to the principle of gradually improving from the basis of popularization, then, not only in serial pictures, but also in all art creation, outstanding painters can be produced.
    China's young art workers are scattered in various cultural and artistic work posts across the country, some are specially engaged in art creation, and some are engaged in creation in their spare time. In terms of their ideological training and artistic accomplishment, they all need the patient cultivation and help of relevant leading departments and predecessors in the art world. Ideological education for young art workers should be placed in the primary position; they should not only be used without paying attention to their cultivation. Special attention should be paid to cultivating the fine ideological character and style of young art workers. Whenever possible, young art workers should be given more creative and learning conditions, and they should be frequently helped to have opportunities to accumulate life knowledge and art knowledge. The older generation of artists should care for and cherish these reserve forces of the art cause with the greatest enthusiasm, so that young art workers can develop normally in their creation. Young art workers themselves should also prevent the problem of being arrogant, complacent and supercilious when they have achieved a little success. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Modesty helps one to progress, arrogance makes one lag behind." Every art worker should always remember this sentence, correct their ideological style, and strive to learn from life, learn from the working people, and learn from the older generation of artists.

### 培养青年美术工作者

    培养青年美术工作者
    在我国近数年来的艺术创作方面，最值得注意的现象之一，是新生力量的迅速成长。青年艺术工作者的队伍日趋扩大，他们的创作数量在艺术界占有很大的比重，他们的创作水平也在不断地提高，经常有优秀的作品出现。最近由文化部、青年团和美术家协会联合举办的全国青年美术工作者作品展览会，提供了有力的例证。
    在这次展出的九百余件作品的作者中，包括青年作者八百余人，其中有不少是初露头角的新人，并且有一部分是业余的美术工作者和兄弟民族的青年美术工作者。他们分布在全国各个地区和各种文化工作岗位上，以饱满的情绪和坚强的毅力在美术创作的道路上迈开了大步；无论在美术创作的各种门类方面，无论在作品的思想内容和艺术表现技巧方面，都比全国解放初期的作品有着显著的进步。通过这次展览会，我们可以看到青年美术工作者在创作方面的无穷潜力。
    我们的国家现在正处于伟大的社会主义改造和建设的时代，社会生活的面貌和人民的精神面貌都发生了空前未有的变化。艺术家在表现生活的时候，不仅需要创造形象的艺术才能，而且需要一种善于发觉新鲜事物的敏感，否则就很难创造出具有艺术魅力而又能反映时代精神的作品。在这次青年美术工作者的作品展览会中，可以看出作者们是具有这种敏感的。他们的较多的作品都反映了社会生活的变化、摆脱经济落后的国家建设的高涨、突破陈腐观念的精神生活的上升，以及在日新月异的万象中涌现出来的生活的美、劳动的美、思想感情的美，因而令人感受到浓厚的生活意味和时代气息。尽管有不少作品在思想内容和艺术表现上还不够深刻和不够成熟，但这是青年美术工作者在创作初期不可避免的缺点，可以在生活实践和创作实践中逐渐克服的。
    近年来美术界在发扬民族美术的优良传统方面已经有了初步的收获，尤其在运用民间美术形式方面。由于美术普及工作的广泛推行，民间形式的美术作品已经在群众的文化生活中树立了比较稳固的基础。这一事实可以从年画、连环图画等等大量出版数字中得到证明。这一方面的成绩，也是和青年美术工作者的巨大努力分不开的。从这次展出的年画和连环图画作品中，可以看出青年美术工作者在学习民间美术上所取得的显著收获，而连环图画的成就表现得特别明显。有些作者在创作中显示了出色的才华，有些作品在艺术表现上显示了高度的技巧，而一般作品的水平也都比较过去有了很大的提高。这种情况证明了“艺术必须与广大的人民群众结合”、“艺术家必须从勤修苦炼的艰巨劳动中才能获得优异的成果”乃是颠扑不破的真理。只要青年美术工作者努力不懈地坚持艺术为广大人民服务的方针，坚持从普及的基础上逐步提高的原则，那么，不仅仅是在连环图画中，而且是在一切美术创作中都可以产生出色的画家的。
    我国的青年美术工作者是分散在全国各种文化艺术工作岗位上面的，有的是专门从事美术创作，有的是利用业余时间从事创作。在他们的思想锻炼和艺术修养方面，都需要有关领导部门和美术界先辈的耐心培养和帮助。应该把对青年艺术工作者的思想教育工作摆在首要的地位；不应该只是使用他们而不注意培养他们。特别应该重视培养青年美术工作者的优良的思想品德和作风。在可能情况下，应该多多给予青年艺术工作者以创作条件和学习条件，应该经常帮助他们有积累生活知识和艺术知识的机会。前辈的艺术家们应该以最大的热情来关心和爱护这些美术事业的后备军，使得青年美术工作者在创作上得到正常的发展。青年美术工作者本身也要防止那种稍有成绩就骄傲自满和目空一切的毛病。毛泽东同志说过：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”。每个美术工作者应该时刻记住这句话，端正思想作风，努力向生活学习，向劳动人民学习，向前辈的艺术家学习。
