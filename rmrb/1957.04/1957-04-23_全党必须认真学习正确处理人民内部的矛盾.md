To conscientiously study and implement Chairman Mao's instructions on correctly handling contradictions among the people is the urgent task of every party organization, especially the party's senior organizations and their responsible personnel. The Party committees of provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, the Party groups of government departments and people's organizations, must actively and conscientiously lead the discussions on this issue both inside and outside the Party, deeply examine the progress of these discussions, understand the ideological trends of various social strata through these discussions, and rapidly strengthen the Party's leadership over the entire ideological and political work. This is of extremely great significance for raising the ideological and political level of the entire Party and the people of the whole country, consolidating the Party's ties with the masses, and promoting the socialist cause in our country.

Since Comrade Mao Zedong made reports at the Supreme State Conference and the Party Central Committee's Propaganda Work Conference, and these reports have been disseminated inside and outside the Party, the issue of correctly handling contradictions among the people has become the issue of greatest concern to the entire Party and the people of the whole country. The enthusiastic discussions of these reports by people from all walks of life across the country have brought about new and lively changes in the political life of our people. Some disputes among the people caused by the bureaucratic errors in leadership work have thus been correctly resolved. Certain tensions between Party workers and non-Party masses, especially non-Party intellectuals, caused by the sectarian errors of Party workers, have thus turned towards relaxation. The leadership methods of many Party organizations have been improved, and the enthusiasm of many masses has been further developed.

However, this is only one aspect of the matter. Correctly handling contradictions among the people is a complex issue, and not everyone can understand it quickly. Not only many of the masses, but also many leading personnel, are not good at distinguishing between contradictions among the people and contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, and are not good at using correct methods to handle contradictions among the people. What is especially necessary to be vigilant about is that some Party workers, after occupying leading positions in various areas, have to varying degrees been infected with the style of the ruling classes of the old society, the style of the Kuomintang's detachment from the masses, and the style of subjectivism, bureaucracy, and sectarianism. They are beginning to forget the Party's teachings on people's democracy and the mass line, and are beginning to forget the Party's teachings on serving the people, integrating with the masses, and caring about the hardships of the masses. It is necessary to once again carry out a large-scale and systematic rectification of the Party's style throughout the country, and to launch correct criticism and self-criticism, in order to achieve the goal of making the whole Party good at correctly handling contradictions among the people. At present, if we can deeply study the instructions on correctly handling contradictions among the people, correct the erroneous understandings on this issue, and overcome the resistant sentiments on this issue, it will create a good start for the Party's style rectification movement. Conversely, if we adopt a simple and perfunctory approach, do not touch the serious problems in the ideological methods and work style of many comrades in the Party, and are satisfied with superficial and partial effects, thinking that everything is fine, then it will not be of any help to the matter.

The difficulty lies in the fact that the leaders of many Party organizations, because they are buried in the busy affairs of socialist transformation and socialist construction in recent years, often neglect the leadership of ideological and political work. The cadre force on the ideological front is very weak and urgently needs to be strengthened; and many Party committees often hand over the leadership of ideological work departments to the second or third in command, rarely intervening, which often leaves the work of these departments in a state of being no one's responsibility. It is obvious that without changing this situation, it will be difficult to lead the study and discussion on correctly handling contradictions among the people, and it will be even more difficult to ask that the Party's instructions on this issue be implemented in actual work.

In order to thoroughly understand the importance and necessity of correctly handling contradictions among the people together with the people of the whole country, and to truly implement the Party's instructions on this issue in actual life, the leading organs of Party organizations at all levels must go all out. The first secretaries and other responsible personnel of Party committees at all levels must personally lead the discussion on this issue, and must personally lead ideological work.

Many Party organizations have already done this, but there are still quite a few Party organizations that are slow to act and lack momentum. The Party's newspapers and periodicals (starting with this newspaper) are also lagging behind in this regard, and there are still quite a few newspapers and periodicals that have not paid attention to the discussion on this issue. This is because, in addition to some comrades in the Party who still have doubts about the policy of correctly handling contradictions among the people, more comrades have not yet realized what great significance the issue of correctly handling contradictions among the people has in today's domestic life.

Contradictions among the people are a long-term phenomenon, and handling contradictions among the people is a long-term task. Since this is the case, why should it be particularly emphasized now? This is because our country is now in a period of great social change. The large-scale class struggle within our country has just ended. As a result of the development of class struggle in the recent period, the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie (the masses of this class account for more than six-fifths of our country's population) are undergoing unprecedented material and spiritual changes. The basic end of class struggle within the country would have made the contradictions among the people rise to a more prominent position on the historical stage. In addition, the profound historical changes experienced by the vast majority of the population have made the issue of contradictions among the people particularly important. However, many of our comrades have not yet realized the full significance of this great social change. They have not yet realized that the times have changed. In the country, the vast majority of the counter-revolutionary forces have been overthrown and eliminated by us, and what remains are only some remnants; although it is still necessary to maintain vigilance and seriousness towards these remnants, and it is still necessary to continue to strike at them, the large-scale class struggle is over. Now, around us are the vast masses who have become masters, the people for whom we have been born and died and fought heroically. The people support us, there is no question about that. The problem is that some contradictions are gradually arising between the people and us, some contradictions that we are not familiar with, that we do not think much about and are not willing to think about. It is precisely these contradictions that require us to face them squarely and handle them cautiously and properly. However, many comrades turn a blind eye to this fundamental change in the objective situation, and they are still accustomed to looking at new problems with old eyes. In this way, they have the serious danger of misusing the methods of handling contradictions between ourselves and the enemy to handle contradictions among the people. Therefore, the Party must shout loudly to them, so that they pay attention to the fact that this great social change is the basic situation in the current domestic life, that contradictions among the people are the new and major phenomena in the current domestic life, and that correctly handling contradictions among the people is the new and major task in the current domestic life.

Our society has been in the midst of great changes for a long time. The War of Resistance Against Japan was a great change, and the War of Liberation was also a great change. But the current great change is much more profound than the great changes in the past. Now we are building socialism. The private ownership of the means of production for thousands of years is rapidly transformed into public ownership, and individual operation is rapidly transformed into collective operation. The ranks of the working class have expanded from more than 7 million to more than 20 million in just seven years. Many peasants, young students and members of other classes have become new components of the working class. The original bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie intellectuals have now lost their original social basis and are transforming into working-class intellectuals. In such a huge and complex change, on the one hand, people excitedly see the bright prospects of the new era, on the other hand, they will inevitably feel this or that kind of unaccustomed, uncoordinated, unfamiliar, unsure, and unable to control their own destiny. Existence determines consciousness, and such a profound social change will of course profoundly reflect on people's thinking. Thinking then directs action, and various different thoughts will of course also be expressed as various different actions.

The social change in our country during this period is a great struggle to overthrow the old social system and establish a new social system - the socialist system - by peaceful methods. This struggle is basically healthy. But anything new needs a time to consolidate, and the new social system also needs a time to consolidate. For example, advanced agricultural producers' cooperatives need about five years to consolidate; it is impossible to imagine that the cooperatives will be consolidated as soon as they are established. During this period of great change, the new social system will definitely be consolidated, but it still needs a time to consolidate. People's psychological ups and downs are precisely the inevitable phenomenon of this transitional period. The Party's task is to focus on strengthening ideological and political work, using patient and persuasive education methods instead of rude and coercive methods to help the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie people consciously accept socialism, and to help more bourgeois and petty bourgeois intellectuals gradually and voluntarily accept Marxism-Leninism over a long period of time, so that the new social system steadily moves towards consolidation. At this important juncture, the ability of leaders to adjust, be cautious, have foresight, and be broad-minded is particularly needed. Therefore, having full awareness of the issue of contradictions among the people, and timely pointing out the way to correctly handle contradictions among the people, has become a fundamental issue of principle.

Some comrades, although they have listened to the reports on correctly handling contradictions among the people, and seem to understand the content of the reports on the surface, have not studied this report in connection with the actual situation of their own departments, as if there are no contradictions among the people in their departments. No, the situation will never be like this. It is impossible to imagine that there are no contradictions between the leaders and the masses in any department, and it is especially impossible to imagine that such a great social change would not be reflected in any department. If there are no such specific contradictions, there will be those specific contradictions; if there are no superficial contradictions, there will be latent contradictions. You say there are none, that is because your sense of smell is not sensitive, and you have not yet discovered them. If we do not study what contradictions among the people exist in our own departments, and do not see the contradictions among the people, our work will be very blind, and we will be passive when the contradictions break out, and may even commit serious political errors due to panic.

Some comrades admit the existence of contradictions among the people, and also admit that the method of persuasion and education, the method of criticism and self-criticism, and the method of free discussion must be used to handle contradictions among the people. But they have not yet developed this habit, or have not yet acquired the ability to convince people with reason, to carry out analytical criticism and self-criticism, and to participate in the contention of a hundred schools of thought, so they feel difficulty. This difficulty will exist, but it is completely surmountable, just like the difficulties we have encountered in the past. The only way to overcome this difficulty is to learn and practice. To make everyone determined to learn, the task must first be put forward. As long as everyone truly understands the importance and necessity of correctly handling contradictions among the people, they will find the way to overcome the difficulties.

It is undoubtedly a political danger for leading workers to not see the contradictions among the people, or to see them but not have the ability to handle them correctly. The danger is not only because they have fallen behind history, but also because the victory of the revolution has pushed them into the ranks of the people's leaders, and their positions may also make them dizzy. Although the new political situation and political tasks are also unfamiliar to the leading workers, some of them do not understand that they must therefore be particularly cautious and particularly humble. They no longer go deep among the masses, closely contact the masses, and learn everything they do not understand from the masses, but instead stand above the masses, trying to turn themselves into a privileged small group and a small sect. In this way, they will not only never correctly distinguish between contradictions between ourselves and the enemy and contradictions among the people, and will never correctly handle contradictions among the people, but will also complicate and intensify contradictions among the people. Although such people are only a minority in our Party, their influence in domestic life and their influence in the development of contradictions among the people cannot be ignored by us.

In short, only by timely recognizing the historical significance of great social changes, timely recognizing the inevitability of the development of contradictions among the people under the new situation, only by adopting correct methods to handle contradictions among the people, by adopting the method of persuasion and education to guide different social strata to continue to move forward, and making the socialist system increasingly consolidated, only by carrying out sufficient work among leading workers, making them adhere to the fine style of going deep among the masses and integrating with the masses, and resolutely correcting the bad style of subjectivism, bureaucracy, and sectarianism, can we mobilize all positive factors and build our country into a united, lively, advanced, and strong socialist country as soon as possible.

It can be seen from this that learning to correctly handle contradictions among the people is the current urgent task of the whole Party. We hope that the responsible persons of various Party organizations will take up the propaganda and education work on this issue, and we hope that various propaganda organs will publicize the reasons why there are contradictions among the people and how the contradictions among the people should be handled. We believe that after the whole Party and the people of the whole country have a correct understanding of the contradictions among the people, it will definitely be easier to resolve the contradictions among the people, it will definitely be possible to give fuller play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the people, and it will definitely be possible to make our socialist cause achieve smoother development.

### 全党必须认真学习正确处理人民内部的矛盾

    全党必须认真学习正确处理人民内部的矛盾
    认真地研究和执行毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的指示，这是当前党的每一个组织、特别是党的高级组织和它们的负责人员的迫切任务。省、市、自治区的党委员会，政府部门和人民团体的党组，必须积极地、认真地领导党内外关于这个问题的讨论，深入地检查这一讨论的进行状况，通过这些讨论了解各社会阶层的思想动向，并且迅速地加强党对于整个思想政治工作的领导。这对提高全党和全国人民的思想政治水平，巩固党同人民群众的联系，推进我国的社会主义事业，有极其重大的意义。
    自从毛泽东同志在最高国务会议上和党中央宣传工作会议上作了报告，这些报告在党内外进行了传达以后，正确地处理人民内部矛盾的问题，已经成为现时全党和全国人民最关心的问题。全国各地各阶层社会人士对于这些报告的热烈的讨论，使我国人民的政治生活发生了新的生动活泼的变化。由领导工作中的官僚主义错误所造成的人民内部的某些纠纷，因此而得到了正确的解决。由党的工作人员的宗派主义错误所造成的党和非党群众特别是非党的知识界之间的某种紧张关系，因此而转向缓和。许多党组织的领导方法得到了改进，许多群众的积极性得到了进一步的发扬。
    但是，这只是事情的一方面。正确处理人民内部的矛盾，这是一个复杂的问题，并不是所有的人都能够很快地了解的。不仅有许多群众，而且有许多领导人员，还不善于区别人民内部的矛盾和敌我之间的矛盾，还不善于用正确的方法去处理人民内部的矛盾。尤其需要警惕的是，党的某些工作人员，在居于各种范围的领导地位以后，在不同程度上沾染了旧社会统治阶级的作风，沾染了国民党的脱离群众的作风，沾染了主观主义、官僚主义和宗派主义的作风。他们开始忘记了党关于人民民主和群众路线的教导，开始忘记了党关于为人民服务、同群众打成一片、关心群众疾苦的教导。需要在全国范围内再一次大规模地、有系统地整顿党的作风，展开正确的批评和自我批评，才能达到使全党善于正确处理人民内部矛盾的目的。在目前，如果能够深入地学习正确处理人民内部矛盾的指示，纠正在这个问题上的错误认识，克服在这个问题上的抵抗情绪，就将为全党整顿作风运动造成一个良好的开端。相反，如果采取简单的敷衍的作法，不去触动党内许多同志的思想方法上和工作作风上的严重问题，满足于表面的和局部的效果，就认为万事大吉，那末，对于事情是不会有什么帮助的。
    事情的困难还在于，许多党组织的领导者因为埋头于近几年的社会主义改造和社会主义建设的繁忙事务，往往忽视了对于思想政治工作的领导。在思想战线上干部力量很弱，迫切地需要加强；而许多党委对于思想工作部门的领导又常交给二三把手去管，很少加以过问，使这些部门的工作往往陷于无人负责的状态。很明显，不改变这种情况，就很难领导关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的学习和讨论，更难要求把党关于这个问题的指示贯彻到实际工作中去。
    为了同全国人民在一起，彻底了解正确处理人民内部矛盾的重要性和必要性，真正在实际生活中贯彻实现党关于这个问题的指示，各级党组织的领导机关必须全力以赴。各级党委的第一书记和其他负责人员必须把关于这个问题的讨论亲自领导起来，必须把思想工作亲自领导起来。
    现在有许多党组织已经这样作了，但是也还有不少党组织的动作还很迟缓，劲头不足。党的报刊（从本报起）在这一方面也是落后的，现在也还有不少报刊没有重视关于这个问题的讨论。这是因为，党内除了有一些同志对于正确处理人民内部矛盾的方针还有怀疑以外，有更多的同志还没有认识到，正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题，在今天的国内生活中，究竟有什么重大的意义。
    人民内部的矛盾是一个长期的现象，处理人民内部矛盾是一个长期的任务。既然如此，为什么现在要特别地加以强调呢？这是因为，我国现在正处在一个社会大变动的时期。我国内部的大规模的阶级斗争刚才结束，作为最近时期的阶级斗争发展的结果，资产阶级、小资产阶级（这个阶级的群众占我国人口的六分之五以上）正在经历着空前未有的物质变化和精神变化。国内阶级斗争的基本结束，本来就会使人民内部的矛盾在历史舞台上上升到比较显著的地位，加上绝大多数人口所经历的这种深刻的历史性的变化，更使人民内部矛盾的问题带有特别重要的性质。而我们的许多同志还没有认识到这个社会大变动的全部意义。他们还没有觉悟到，时代已经变了。在国内，反革命势力的绝大部分已经被我们推翻了，扫除了，剩下的只是些残余；对于这些残余虽然还需要保持警惕性和严肃性，还需要继续给以打击，但是大规模的阶级斗争是过去了。现在，在我们周围的是广大的成了主人的人民，是我们曾经为之而出生入死、英勇奋斗的人民。人民是支持我们的，这没有问题。问题是人民同我们中间也逐渐产生一些矛盾，产生一些我们所不熟悉的、我们所不大想到和不大愿意想到的矛盾，正是这种矛盾要求我们必须加以正视，必须谨慎地、妥善地加以处理。但是许多同志对于客观形势的这个根本变化熟视无睹，他们还习惯于用老眼光看新问题。这样，他们就有误用处理敌我矛盾的方法去处理人民内部矛盾的严重危险。因此，党必须向他们大喝一声，让他们注意这个社会大变动是当前国内生活的基本形势，人民内部矛盾是当前国内生活中的新的重大的现象，正确地处理人民内部矛盾是当前国内生活中的新的重大的课题。
    我们的社会很久以来就处在大变动中间了。抗日战争时期是大变动，解放战争时期也是大变动。但是现在的大变动要比过去的大变动深刻得多。现在我们是在建设社会主义。几千年来的生产资料的私有制迅速地转变为公有制，个体经营迅速地转变为集体经营。工人阶级的队伍在短短的七年里由七百多万人扩大到两千多万人。许多农民、青年学生以及其他阶层的成员成为工人阶级的新的组成部分。原来的资产阶级、小资产阶级的知识界现在丧失了原有的社会基础，正在转变为工人阶级的知识界。在这样巨大的复杂的变化中，人们一方面兴奋地看到了新时代的光明的前景，另一方面又不可免地会感到这样那样的不习惯，不协调，生疏，不摸底，不能掌握自己的命运。存在决定意识，这样深刻的社会大变动当然要深刻地反映到人们的思想上来。思想又指挥行动，各种不同的思想当然也要表现为各种不同的行动。
    我们国家这个时期的社会大变动，是一场伟大的、用和平的方法推翻旧的社会制度，建立新的社会制度——社会主义制度的斗争。这个斗争基本上是健康的。但是任何新出现的东西都需要有一个巩固的时间，新的社会制度也需要有一个巩固的时间。例如高级农业生产合作社，就大约需要五年的时间才能巩固；不能设想合作社一建立起来就巩固了，那是不可能的。在这个大变动的时期，新的社会制度一定会巩固，但还需要有一个时间去巩固。人们心理上的七上八下，正是这种过渡时期的必然现象。党的任务，就是着重地加强思想政治工作，用耐心的、说服教育的方法而不是用粗暴的、强制的方法去帮助资产阶级和小资产阶级的人们自觉地接受社会主义，帮助较多的资产阶级和小资产阶级的知识分子，在一个长时期内，逐步地自愿地接受马克思列宁主义，使新的社会制度稳步地走向巩固。在这个重要关头，特别需要领导人员的善于调理，谨慎将事，目光远大，胸怀宽广。因此，对于人民内部矛盾这个问题具有充分的自觉，及时地指出正确处理人民内部矛盾的道路，就成为一个具有根本原则性的问题。
    有些同志虽然听了关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的报告，在表面上似乎也懂得了报告的内容，但是并没有联系本部门的实际情况来研究这个报告，好像他们那儿并不存在什么人民内部的矛盾。不，情况决不会是这样的。不可能想像哪一个部门的领导和群众之间会完全没有矛盾，尤其不可能想像这样大的社会变动在哪一个部门会没有任何反映。没有这样的具体矛盾，会有那样的具体矛盾；没有表面化的矛盾，会有潜伏着的矛盾。你说没有，那是因为你的嗅觉不灵，还没有发现。如果我们不研究本部门人民内部有些什么矛盾，看不见人民内部的矛盾，我们的工作就会带着很大的盲目性，就会在矛盾爆发的时候陷于被动，甚至会由于惊慌失措而犯严重的政治错误。
    有些同志承认人民内部矛盾的存在，也承认必须用说服教育的方法、用批评和自我批评的方法、用自由讨论的方法去处理人民内部的矛盾。但是他们还没有养成这种习惯，或者还没有获得能够以理服人、能够进行有分析的批评和自我批评、能够参加百家争鸣的本领，因而感觉困难。这种困难是会有的，但是也像过去我们所遇到过的困难一样，是完全可以克服的。克服这个困难的唯一出路，就是学习和实践。要使大家立下学习的决心，首先必须提出任务。只要大家的确懂得了正确处理人民内部矛盾的重要性和必要性，他们就会找到克服困难的道路。
    领导工作人员看不到人民内部的矛盾，或者虽然看到了而没有能力加以正确的处理，在政治上无疑是一种危险。危险不仅是由于他们落到了历史的后面，而且是由于革命的胜利把他们拥上了人民领导者的行列，他们的地位还可能冲昏他们的头脑。新的政治形势和政治任务对于领导工作人员虽然也是生疏的，但是他们中间有少数人却不懂得因此而必须特别谨慎，特别谦虚。他们不再深入群众之中，密切地联系群众，向群众学习自己所不懂得的一切，却反而站在群众之上，企图把自己变为一个享有特权的小集团、小宗派。这样，他们就不但决不会正确地区别敌我矛盾和人民内部的矛盾，决不会正确地处理人民内部的矛盾，而且会使人民内部的矛盾复杂化，紧张化。这样的人在我们党内虽然只是少数，但是他们在国内生活中的影响，在人民内部矛盾发展中的影响，却不容我们忽视。
    总之，只有及时地认识社会大变动的历史意义，及时地认识人民内部矛盾在新形势下发展的必然性，只有采取正确的方法处理人民内部矛盾，采取说服教育的方法引导不同的社会阶层继续前进，使社会主义制度日见巩固，只有在领导工作人员中进行充分的工作，使他们坚持深入群众、同群众打成一片的优良作风，坚决纠正主观主义、官僚主义、宗派主义的恶劣作风，我们才能够调动一切积极因素，尽快地把我们的国家建成为一个团结一致的、生动活泼的、先进的、强大的社会主义国家。
    由此可见，学会正确地处理人民内部的矛盾，是全党当前的迫切任务。我们希望各个党组织的负责人都把这个问题的宣传教育工作抓起来，希望各个宣传机关都来宣传人民内部为什么会有矛盾和应该怎样来处理人民内部的矛盾的道理。我们相信，全党和全国人民对于人民内部的矛盾有了正确的认识之后，就一定可以更容易地解决人民内部的矛盾，就一定可以更充分地发挥人民群众的积极性创造性，就一定可以使我们的社会主义事业获得更顺利的发展。
