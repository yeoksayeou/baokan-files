    The Flow of Water
    Liu Qingde
    Mountain streams flow downwards, rushing towards the vast river. The river surges forward, and suddenly a stream bursts its banks and surges out. The water in the river cries out, "Oh no! Don't go that way! Turn back, hurry back!" But the stream doesn't stop or turn back, shouting, "The river channel restricts my individuality! I want to fully develop my individuality!" It rushes through the breach, spreading out in all directions on the plain—flooding, expanding. A major road ahead shouts, "Turn back! This is the main road, the ridge of a field!" "What main road, what ridge! These are just rigid rules!" the stream howls, continuing to surge forward. The road warns again, and the stream angrily says, "Don't hinder me! This is my individuality!"

    Large swathes of fields are submerged, roads are destroyed, door panels float on the water, and forests in the water look like reeds. Before long, the water becomes increasingly muddy, increasingly polluted, and finally dries up.

    The water that insists on direction, following the river channel forward, becomes increasingly clear, converging into a majestic torrent, passing through perilous gorges, generating huge amounts of electrical energy, turning machinery, and bringing light to the darkness. It also flows to countless small canals on both the north and south banks, quenching the thirst of the desert, irrigating fertile fields. The nature of the water is developed to the maximum. This water is singing and flowing towards the vast sea!

    水的奔流
    刘庆德
    山水滚滚地往下奔流，奔向浩浩荡荡的大河。河水汹涌着前进，一股水流突然决堤奔涌。河里的水高呼：“哎呀！不能往那个方向！回头，赶快回头！”这股水不停留，也不回头，一面大喊：“河道束缚了我的个性，我要充分发挥我的个性！”它冲过决口，在平地上向四面八方奔去——泛滥着、扩展着。一条大路在前面高喊：“回头，这里是大道，是田埂！”“什么大道、田埂！这是清规戒律！”那股水嚎叫着，继续往前涌去；大路又一次警告，那股水愤愤地说：“别妨碍我，这是我的个性！”
    大片的田野被淹没，大路被冲毁，水上漂浮着门板，树林在水中好像芦苇；而不久，这水也就越来越混浊，越来越污秽，终于干涸了。
    那坚持方向、循着河道前进的水，越来越清澈，汇成雄浑的巨流，穿过险阻的峡谷，发出了巨量的电能，转动机轮，给黑夜带来光明；还流向南北两岸无数的小渠，供沙漠解渴，灌良田沃野；水性得到最大限度的发挥。这水正在向浩瀚的大海高歌奔流！
