Xinhua News Agency, March 31st: The head of the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture told Xinhua reporters today that since the Central Committee put forward the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," the Film Bureau, after repeated discussions and adoption of opinions from all sides, has decided to improve the organizational form and leadership methods of the film department to promote the prosperity of China's film art. The plan formulated by the Film Bureau is currently being gradually implemented in various film studios and related units.

The负责人 said that since liberation, China's film industry has achieved many successes, but there are also serious shortcomings, such as over-strict censorship, over-centralized management, low film output, and low quality of some films. In the improvement plan for film work, it is stipulated that, in the future, under the principle of strengthening the leadership of the Film Bureau in terms of guidelines and policies, the various film studios and creative personnel will be responsible for artistic creation, in order to overcome the excessive interference in artistic creation in the past and enable film creators to maximize their enthusiasm for creation. In the future, all scripts and films will be approved for production and distribution by the film studios (Shanghai Film Production Company in Shanghai). Each film studio will form several creative organizations centered on the main creative personnel, who will freely organize scripts and select actors, implementing free combination. Shanghai Film Production Company, which has better equipment and more creative personnel, has decided to change its name to Shanghai Film Production Corporation and divide the feature film part into three small studios to fully exploit its potential and create a wider range of themes and films of different styles, competing with each other in film production.

In terms of leadership in film art creation, in the future, the Film Bureau will focus on the leadership of guidelines, policies, and ideology, as well as determining the proportion of film themes; the various film studios (or companies) will mainly grasp political principles and strive to achieve a higher artistic level in the films. In the future, the activities of film workers will be greatly strengthened, so that film workers can frequently study and discuss various issues in film art creation, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and pay attention to the supervision of public opinion.

In the future, film creators will implement a wage system of base salary and remuneration, in order to implement the principle of "to each according to his work" and encourage the enthusiasm of film workers. In order to enable film creators to understand the film release situation and audience opinions, the current relationship between film production and distribution will also be changed in the future to stimulate film production and improve quality.

    让电影艺术百花齐放
    电影部门改进组织形式和领导方法
    据新华社31日讯　文化部电影事业管理局负责人，今天向新华社记者说，电影事业管理局自中央提出“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针以后，经过反复讨论，并采纳各方面的意见，已经决定改进电影部门的组织形式和领导方法，以繁荣我国的电影艺术。电影局制定的方案目前正在各制片厂及有关单位逐步实施中。
    负责人说，解放以来，我国电影事业获得了很多成绩，但也存在严重的缺点，如审查过严、管理过分集中，影片产量少、部分质量低等。在电影工作的改进方案中，规定今后在电影事业管理局加强方针政策领导的原则下，将由各制片厂和创作人员负起艺术创作的责任，以克服过去对艺术创作的过多干涉，使电影创作人员尽量发挥创作的积极性。今后所有的剧本和影片，均由制片厂（上海为上海电影制片公司）批准摄制和发行，各制片厂将以主要创作人员为中心组成若干创作组织，由他们自己组织剧本、挑选演员，实行自由组合。拥有较好设备和较多创作人员的上海电影制片厂，决定改为上海电影制片公司并将故事片部分分为三个小厂，充分发挥潜力，创作题材更广泛和各种不同风格的影片，在制片方面互相竞赛。
    在电影艺术的创作领导方面，今后，电影局将着重方针政策和思想的领导，以及确定影片题材的比例；各制片厂（或公司）则主要掌握政治原则，并且努力使影片达到较高的艺术水平。今后将大大加强电影工作者的活动，使电影工作者经常能研究讨论电影艺术创作中的各种问题，展开批评与自我批评，并重视社会舆论的监督。
    今后电影创作人员将实行基薪、酬金的工资制度，以贯彻按劳取酬的原则，鼓舞电影工作者的积极性。为了使电影创作人员了解影片上映情况和观众的意见，今后还将改变现行的制片与发行的关系，以刺激影片生产和提高质量。
