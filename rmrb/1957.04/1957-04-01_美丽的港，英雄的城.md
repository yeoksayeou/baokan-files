    Beautiful Port, City of Heroes
    On a clear spring day, we set off from Tirana, along the coastal area, to visit Vlorë, the economic center of southern Albania.

    The car sped along the flat asphalt road. On both sides of the road were lush green wheat fields, and rolling hills in the distance bathed in the morning sun. The slopes were covered with square vineyards, and the mountains were dotted with clusters of olive groves. Blooming peach and plum trees adorned the verdant olive groves. Smoke from farmhouses rose in the morning sun.

    After a three-hour drive, the car delivered us to our destination.

    Vlorë is located close to the Adriatic Sea, only about forty miles across the sea from Italy; not far to the south is the famous ancient Greek fortress of Corfu, where the famous Russian naval commander Ushakov fought bravely against Napoleon's army.

    Vlorë is one of the ancient cities of Albania. As early as the 5th century BC, the ancestors of the Albanian people, the Illyrians, built fortresses and opened the famous "Oricum" port on the Adriatic Sea. Not long ago, many stone and bronze age utensils were unearthed here. An arena capable of holding more than 30,000 people, built in the third century BC, was also excavated near the city. These relics and remains fully illustrate the long history of the Albanian nation and culture.

    Vlorë is also one of Albania's heroic cities. When Albania groaned under the pain of foreign aggression, the people of Vlorë never yielded. They raised the banner of uprising and fought bravely against the Turkish invaders and the German and Italian fascists. Today, in the squares and gardens of Vlorë, stand the bronze statues of patriots, who are forever revered by the people. In the city center stands the bronze statue of the outstanding patriot Ismail Qemali. On December 28, 1912, after a stormy uprising against the Turkish invaders, he raised the first red flag with the double-headed eagle (note) in this heroic city, solemnly declaring to the world that the heroic Albanian nation is forever unconquerable. At the entrance of the nearly completed theater, stands the bronze statue of the patriot Avni Rustemi, the hero who broke the ban of Zog's feudal rule and suggested a five-minute silence for Lenin's death in Zog's parliament. In 1920, in order to oppose Italy's partition of Albania, thousands upon thousands of patriotic people in Vlorë raised ancient weapons to fight against the Italian bandits, fiercely fighting for three months, and finally forced the Italian invading army, equipped with modern weapons, to withdraw from the port, writing a glorious page in the history of the Albanian national liberation movement.

    After liberation in 1944, the people of Vlorë, like the people of the whole country, rebuilt their city under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party. Over the past twelve years, great changes have taken place here.

    Koço Vasili, Secretary of the Vlorë City Committee of the Labor Party, told us: "In the past, Vlorë had nothing. If there was anything, it was just a dilapidated city; if there was anything, it all belonged to the lords or landlords: the land was theirs, the olive groves were theirs, and even the only 'industry,' a few dilapidated workshops, were theirs!" But today there are people's factories here, and there are cement plants, cannery complexes, rice mills, leather factories, oil presses... and a mechanical repair shop that have never existed in Albanian history.

    Vlorë has become a new industrial city. The population has increased nearly three and a half times since liberation.

    The cement plant, which started construction in 1952, is named after the great revolutionary teacher Lenin. Now, the giant grinders rumble day and night, and the workers work in three shifts, producing nearly 60,000 tons of cement for the country every year. When we visited, the chief engineer introduced us to the outstanding workers one by one. Most of them were farmers not long ago, but today they have become skilled workers. We don't speak the same language, but gestures, eye contact, and Arabic numerals have become our language. They enthusiastically told us that the factory has overfulfilled its annual production plan every year. Grinding worker Leu Çud firmly grasped my hand. At this time, the workshop director introduced me to him, saying that he completed 117% of the entire plan last year. A comrade from the Party Committee then said: "They are just one of thousands. In recent years, more than 2,300 shock workers have emerged in Vlorë, and more than 890 people have won the title of Stakhanovite workers."

    The cannery complex, designed and assembled by the German Democratic Republic, is named after the outstanding son of the German people, Thälmann. The entire production process is a continuous operation. At the entrance of the factory building, there are only boxes of fresh fish, and in less than an hour, there are cans of canned food at the exit of the factory building. The factory produces more than 800 tons of canned fish and 270 tons of canned fruits and vegetables annually. 65% of the factory workers are women. In the era of the people's regime, the factory opened its doors to women in Vlorë for the first time. According to last year's statistics, 21.5% of the workers in Vlorë are women.

    We stayed in a travel agency by the sea, and we could hear the roaring sea waves when we opened the window. The beautiful port was in full view. Vlorë is a natural bay. The Linguetta Cape stretches into the Adriatic Sea like a giant arm. The coast is a resort area, where sanatoriums for workers and Young Pioneers have been built. The port is twelve meters deep, and ten-thousand-ton freighters can sail directly into the port. In the past, it was a springboard for Italy to attack the Albanian hinterland, but today it has become Albania's second commercial port. Albania's famous natural asphalt is shipped abroad from here. A newly renovated four-kilometer-long flat asphalt road stretches from the port to the city center. Many new buildings are under construction on both sides of the avenue, and workers are planting tall white poplars and beautiful fir trees around them.

    "The face of Vlorë is changing with each passing day, even we can hardly recognize it ourselves!" said a female comrade who accompanied us on the visit, who has lived in Vlorë since she was a child.

    Before liberation, there was only one dilapidated garden, a handful of water pipes, and a few sewers in Vlorë. But today, eleven beautiful gardens have been built, and subtropical palm trees sway in the sea breeze. The municipal authorities have not only laid perfect underground sewers, but also installed fifty-eight tap water supply stations for the working people. In the past, Vlorë's annual power generation was only 2 million kilowatt-hours, but now it generates 1 million kilowatt-hours in one month. At the same time, Vlorë has become a city with a high level of culture. During the visit, the hosts enthusiastically pointed out to us that this is a middle school, that is a normal school, this is a cinema, and that is a cultural center, a people's hospital, and so on. Since the implementation of the first five-year plan, the government has built a large number of new houses for the working people. All of this is something that the older generation of Vlorë people could not even dream of.

    On the night of the visit, we visited the cultural center. In the past, this was the villa of a large landlord, but now it is a place for the working people to rest and relax. Comrades from the amateur art troupe, who won the first prize in the national singing and dancing competition in 1954, warmly welcomed us. They excitedly sang "We Workers Have Strength" in Chinese. From this loud singing, we felt the Albanian people's firm confidence in building socialism, and their deep friendship with the Chinese people.

    Note: The eagle is the symbol of the Albanian nation. The double-headed eagle represents the united strength of the ancient Albanian north and south to jointly resist foreign aggression. Now the national emblem of Albania is marked by the double-headed eagle.

### 美丽的港，英雄的城

    美丽的港，英雄的城
    一个晴朗的春日，我们从地拉那出发，沿着滨海地区，到阿尔巴尼亚南方的经济中心发罗那城访问。
    汽车在平坦的柏油公路上疾驶。公路两旁是绿油油的麦田，远近起伏的山陵沐浴在春晨的阳光里。斜坡上是一方方的葡萄田，山上是一丛丛的橄榄林。苍翠的橄榄林里点缀着盛开的桃李。农舍的炊烟正在朝阳里升起。
    汽车经过三小时的行程，把我们送到了目的地。
    发罗那紧靠亚得里亚海，隔海四十多里就是意大利；往南不远就是有名的希腊古要塞科孚岛，俄国海军名将乌沙柯夫曾在那里同拿破仑的军队英勇战斗。
    发罗那城是阿尔巴尼亚的古城之一。早在公元前五世纪，阿民族的祖先伊里亚人就在这块土地上建筑起城堡和开辟了当时亚得里亚海有名的“奥里贡”港口。不久以前，这儿曾出土了不少石器时代和青铜时代的器皿。在城市附近还掘出了一个可容三万多人的运动场，它是纪元前三世纪的建筑。这些遗物和遗迹充分说明了阿尔巴尼亚民族和文化的悠久历史。
    发罗那也是阿尔巴尼亚的英雄城之一。当阿尔巴尼亚呻吟在外族侵略的苦痛岁月里的时候，发罗那的人民从来没有屈服过，他们举起义旗，前仆后继地同土耳其侵略者和德意法西斯作过殊死的斗争。今天，在发罗那市区的广场和花园内，矗立着爱国者们的铜像，他们永远受到人们的敬仰。市中心区是杰出的爱国者伊斯马依尔·钱马利的铜像。1912年12月28日，在经过了反抗土耳其侵略者的暴风雨般的起义以后，他在这英雄的城市升起了第一面双头鹰红旗（注），庄严地向全世界宣布：英雄的阿尔巴尼亚民族是永远不可征服的。在即将竣工的影剧院门口，树立的是爱国者阿·罗斯泰米的铜像，他是打破索古封建统治的禁令，在索古的国会上建议为列宁逝世默哀五分钟的英雄。1920年，发罗那的人民为了反对意大利瓜分阿尔巴尼亚，成千成万的爱国志士举起古老的武器抗击意大利匪徒，激战了三个月，终于迫使配有新式武器的意大利侵略军撤出了港口，在阿尔巴尼亚民族解放运动史上写下了光辉的一页。
    1944年解放后，发罗那的人民同全国人民一样，在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下重建了自己的城市。十二年多以来，这里发生了巨大的变化。
    劳动党发罗那市委书记科乔·瓦西里告诉我们：“过去，发罗那什么也没有。如果说有，那只是一个破烂的城市；如果说有，那也都是属于领主们或地主们的：土地是他们的，橄榄林是他们的，甚至连仅有的‘工业’，几个破作坊也是他们的啊！”但是今天这儿有了人民的工厂，出现了阿尔巴尼亚历史上从来没有过的水泥厂、罐头联合工厂、碾米厂、皮革厂、榨油厂……，还有一个机械修理厂。
    发罗那成了一个新的工业城市。人口比解放前增加了近三倍半。
    水泥厂是1952年开工兴建的，它以伟大的革命导师列宁的名字命名。现在，巨型的磨研机日夜不停地隆隆作响，工人们分作三班轮流工作，一年为国家生产近六万吨水泥。当我们参观时，总工程师一一向我们介绍了优秀的工人。他们大多数不久以前还是农民，而今天已成为熟练的工人了。我们语言不通，但是手势、眼色和阿拉伯数字都成了我们的语言。他们热情地告诉我们，全厂每年的生产都超额完成了计划。磨研工人莱乌楚德紧紧地握住了我的手，这时车间主任向我介绍，他去年完成了全计划的117％。党委会的一位同志接着说：“他们都只是千百个当中的一个。几年来，整个发罗那涌现了二千三百多个突击手，有八百九十多人荣获了斯达哈诺夫式工作者的称号。”
    由民主德国设计和装配起来的罐头联合工厂，是以德国人民优秀的儿子台尔曼命名的。整个生产过程是流水作业的。在厂房进口处，还只是一箱箱的鲜鱼，不到一个钟点，在厂房的出口处已是一听听的罐头。这个厂年产鱼类罐头八百多吨，水果蔬菜罐头二百七十吨。全厂工人65％是女工。在人民政权年代里，工厂第一次为发罗那妇女打开了大门。据去年统计，发罗那的工人中有21.5％是妇女。
    我们住在海边的一个旅行社内，打开窗户就能听到澎湃的海涛声，美丽的港口一览无遗。发罗那是一个天然的海湾。林古埃特塔角像一条巨臂伸入亚得里亚海。海岸上是休养地，那儿建有工人和少先队员的休养所。港口深达十二公尺，万吨巨轮可直驶港内。过去它曾是意大利进攻阿尔巴尼亚腹地的跳板，而今天它已成为阿尔巴尼亚的第二个商港了。阿尔巴尼亚有名的天然沥青，就是从这儿运销国外的。刚改建成的一条四公里长的平坦的柏油大道，从港口一直伸向市中心。大道两旁有不少新的建筑正在兴建，工人们正在周围种植挺秀的白杨和美丽的枞树。
    “发罗那的面貌在日新月异地变化，甚至连我们自己也难以辨认了！”一位陪同我们参观的女同志说，她从小就住在发罗那。
    解放前，发罗那城只有一个破烂的花园、屈指可数的几根水管和几条下水道。但今天已修建了十一座美丽的花园，亚热带的棕榈树在海风中摇曳。市政当局不仅铺设了完美的地下水道，并为劳动人民安装了五十八个自来水供应站。过去发罗那全年发电量仅二百万度，而现在一个月就发一百万度。同时，发罗那已成为一个有高度文化的城市了，在参观时，主人们热情地指点着告诉我们，这儿是中学，那儿是师范学校，这儿是电影院，那儿是文化馆、人民医院等等。第一个五年计划实施以来，政府为劳动人民兴建了大批的新住宅。所有这些都是老一辈的发罗那人连做梦也想不到的。
    访问的当晚，我们参观了文化馆。过去这儿是大领主的别墅，现在已是劳动人民休息娱乐的场所。1954年曾获得全国歌舞比赛一等奖的业余艺术团的同志们热情地欢迎我们。他们兴奋地用中文歌唱着“咱们工人有力量”。从这嘹亮的歌声中，我们感到了阿尔巴尼亚人民建设社会主义的坚强信心，感到了他们对中国人民的深厚友情。
    注：雄鹰是阿尔巴尼亚国家的象征。双头鹰是表示古阿尔巴尼亚南北双方的力量联合起来共同抗击外族侵略。现在阿尔巴尼亚的国徽就是以双头鹰为标志的。
