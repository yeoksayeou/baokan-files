Editor's Note: During Chairman Voroshilov's visit to our country, we received a large number of letters from readers across the country addressed to Chairman Voroshilov. Below are excerpts from some of these letters.

Respected Chairman Voroshilov:

    Please allow me to welcome your arrival with a special respect: I recently gave birth to my first daughter. I love my little baby very much and gave her the nickname "Yan'er." During these days, you are visiting our country, and to commemorate your arrival, I decided to change her name to "Fusheng." I believe that the virtues embodied in you can inspire awe in the Creator and bring peace and happiness to our child. Dear Chairman, you said at the banquet held by Premier Zhou: "Wishing all people on Earth to live in peace." I thank you for your blessing, and I also wish our "Fusheng" to live in peace forever.

        Cai Jingxin, Accountant of Jinzhou Cotton Processing Factory

Dear Grandpa Voroshilov:

    Several months ago, when we learned that you were coming to visit China, we were very excited, and now this long-awaited happy day has arrived. You and us in China, in Beijing, have lived together for many days. Although I have not been by your side in person, I have not met you, but I seem to be able to see you anytime, anywhere: seeing you talking and embracing with our beloved Chairman Mao intimately... seeing you talking with the people of our country... seeing everything about you, and caring about everything about you. Your speech at the mass rally in the Temple of Agriculture even more excited our hearts. I have read your speech several times, and the more I read, the more power I feel. I can still imagine the scene in the Temple of Agriculture at that time, this scene makes me very moved and makes me shed tears of happiness and joy. I firmly believe that the brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people fighting for a common cause is harder than diamonds. In order to consolidate our friendship, I am willing to dedicate all my strength.

        Yan Benjing, Student of Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel

Grandpa Voroshilov:

    You've arrived. I—a young student—warmly welcome you, old man. You brought the friendship of the Soviet people, you brought the hearts of the Soviet youth.

    On April 15th, I heard your kind and sonorous voice on the radio, I heard your passionate, surging, and sincere speech, I heard the thunderous applause welcoming you, I heard the cheers of the crowd.

    Although the radio later broadcasted "The broadcast ends here," Grandpa, it was as if I didn't hear this sentence, I sat still for a long time, unable to restrain my excited emotions. Joy and excitement occupied my entire heart. I thought, how great it would be if there was a TV in front of me!

    Grandpa, there is a Chinese saying: "A goose feather sent from a thousand miles away, the gift is light but the affection is deep." Here I am sending a beautiful and exquisite little flower basket made of colored paper, as a token of my heart.

            Liang Huaibai, Student of Suzhou No. 5 Middle School

Chairman Voroshilov:

    We live on an island in the southeast coast of the motherland. Ever since we learned the good news that you were coming to visit China, we have been longing for this happy day to come as soon as possible every moment. Now that you have brought the friendship of 200 million great Soviet people, we, the people of the island far away from the motherland, can also share this great friendship and feel great honor and excitement.

    In these days of national jubilation, we stand under the broadcaster every evening and listen quietly to the news about your activities in China. Every piece of news about your visit activities published in the newspaper strongly attracts us to read them all, word by word. When we saw the photo of you climbing the Wanchun Pavilion in Jingshan with strong steps, we naturally smiled and felt infinite excitement in our hearts. Because, your health is the common interest of the people of the Soviet Union and China, and also the interest of the peace-loving people of the world. We wish you a long life of a hundred years, and wish the Sino-Soviet friendship to last forever.

    Zhang Shichun and Lu Bing, Two Ordinary Citizens on Pingtan Island, Fujian Province

Respected Chairman Voroshilov:

    In order to express our respect for you, all the members of our cooperative have sent you a chicken-blood seal. This seal is made of a piece of "chicken-blood stone," known as the "Queen of Stones," unearthed more than 200 years ago. The front is engraved with the five characters "Voroshilov," and the side is also engraved with two lines of small characters: "Sino-Soviet friendship is as solid as a rock. Present this small gift to express our heartfelt feelings." Now this seal has been entrusted to the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association for forwarding to you, please accept it with a smile. Finally, I wish you boundless longevity!

        Respectfully presented by all members of the Yangzhou Carving Production Cooperative

Dear Chairman Voroshilov:

    I am a young Chinese citizen. Although I live in a remote area in northern China and do not have the opportunity to welcome you in person, I felt that you were right in front of me when I listened to the live broadcast on the radio. I am working in forestry. When you came to China, I was participating in tree planting in the windy and sandy grassland area in northern China to green the motherland. I am willing to plant trees with the most meticulous care, let them grow luxuriantly, quickly become forests, let it be a memorial to your friendly visit to China, and let it be a symbol of the eternal friendship between China and the Soviet Union.

            Shi Kewang, A Forestry Worker in Jilin Province

    To commemorate the visit of Chairman Voroshilov, the great leader of the Soviet Union, to our country, I respectfully compose forty-six verses in the style of ancient poetry, to express my admiration, and to offer it for Chairman Voroshilov's amusement.

    ………………
    In the year of 1957, on the fifteenth of April,
    The leader came from ten thousand miles, descending from the sky with the wind.
    The spring scenery is charming, and the flowers are娇欲语.
    The leader welcomed him personally, with grand ceremony and deeper feelings.
    Tens of thousands of households emptied their alleys, lining the roads like walls.
    Flags and banners were red for thirty miles, and the suburbs resounded with Sheng drums.
    Waving, shouting and cheering wildly, admiring the two pillars.
    All the people have the same thoughts, hoping to see his demeanor quickly.
    All cherish the wish to be loyal, and their sincere hearts can be grasped.
    The people listen to the great enlightenment, who can stop God's will?
    ………………
    Moscow and Beijing, auspicious and harmonious Qi and Lu.
    Eight hundred million people, united in heart, tune the Yellow Bell.
    Strong enough to turn the tide, beware of being insulted.
    Dare to tell the fire players, end the delay and delay.
    The great unity of the world, the predecessors have not really raised it.
    Forever willing to wash away armor and soldiers, high righteousness will last forever.
    The leader said kindly, the world will follow you.

        Respectfully presented by Li Junyu, a citizen of Beijing, China

    祝伏老长命百岁  祝友谊万古常青
    编者按　在伏罗希洛夫主席访问我国的日子里，我们收到了全国各地读者写给伏罗希洛夫主席的大批信件。下面发表的是其中一些来信的摘要。敬爱的伏罗希洛夫主席：
    请让我以一种特殊的敬意来欢迎您的到来：我在最近生了第一个女孩子。我非常疼爱自己的小宝宝，给她取了个乳名叫“彦儿”。正在这些日子里，您到我国来访问了，为了纪念您的到来，我决定把她的名字改为“伏生”。我相信，交织在您身上的美德，可以使造物肃然起敬，把和平和幸福降临给我们的孩子。亲爱的主席，您在周总理举行的酒会上曾说：“祝地球上所有的人生活在和平之中”，我感谢您的祝福，我也愿意我们的“伏生”永远生活在和平之中。
    锦州市棉花加工厂会计　才镜心亲爱的伏老伯伯：
    几个月前我们知道您要到中国访问的消息后，我们就非常兴奋，现在这日夜盼望的幸福日子已经到来了。您和我们在中国，在北京，在一起生活了好些日子。虽然我没有亲自在您身边，我没有见到您，但我好像能随时随地见到您：见到您在和我们敬爱的毛主席亲切地谈话和拥抱……见到您和我国人民在谈话……看到您的一切，同样关心着您的一切。您在先农坛群众大会上的演说，更激动了我们的心。您的演说我读了好几遍，我越读越觉得有力量。当时先农坛的情景我还想像得出，这种情景使我非常感动，使我流出了幸福和愉快的眼泪。我深信，为了共同事业而奋斗的中苏人民兄弟般的友谊，比金刚石还坚硬，为了巩固我们的友谊，我愿意献出一切的力量。
          北京钢铁学院学生　颜本敬伏罗希洛夫伯伯：
    您来了。我——一个青年学生，热烈地欢迎您老人家。您带来了苏联人民的友谊、您带来了苏联青年的心意。
    4月15那天，我在收音机里听到了您的亲切雄浑的声音，听到了您的热情澎湃、真挚动人的讲话，听到了欢迎您的雷一样的掌声，听到了万众喧腾的欢呼声。
    虽然收音机里后来传出了“转播到此结束”的话声，可是，伯伯，我好像没有听到这句话一样，久久地凝坐着，抑制不住自己激动的感情。喜悦和兴奋占据了我整个的心房。我想，要是面前有一架电视机可多好啊！
    伯伯，中国有句俗语说：“千里送鹅毛，礼轻情意重”。我在这里寄上一只用彩纸编成的美丽玲珑的小花篮，略表我的心意。
                    苏州市第五中学学生　梁怀白伏罗希洛夫主席：
    我们居住在祖国东南沿海的一个海岛上。自从知道您要来中国访问的喜讯，每时每刻都在渴望着这个可喜的日子早日来临。现在您带来了两亿苏联伟大人民的友谊，我们远离祖国的海岛人民也能分享这一份伟大的友谊，感到莫大的光荣和兴奋。
    在这举国欢腾的日子里，我们每天傍晚都站在广播器下面静听有关您在中国活动的情况。报纸上刊载的关于您访问活动的每一则消息，都强烈地吸引着我们一句一字地把它们全部看完。当我们看到您迈着强健的步伐登上景山万春亭的照片时，我们很自然地露出笑容，心中感到无限兴奋。因为，您的健康是苏中两国人民的共同利益，也是全世界爱好和平人民的利益。我们祝您长命百岁，祝中苏友谊永存世间。
    福建省平潭岛上的两个普通公民　张诗椿　陆冰尊敬的伏罗希洛夫主席：
    为了表达我们对您的敬意，我社全体社员把一方鸡血图章送给您。这方图章是用一块在二百多年前出土的有“石中皇后”之称的“鸡血石”刻成的。正面刻着“伏罗希洛夫”五个字，侧面还刻着两行小字：“中苏友谊，坚如磐石。献兹微礼，以表寸心。”现在这方图章已请北京中苏友协总会转送给您，请笑纳。最后，敬祝您万寿无疆！
              扬州刻字生产合作社全体社员敬上亲爱的伏罗希洛夫主席：
    我是个中国青年公民。虽然我住在中国北部边远地方，没有条件亲自欢迎您，但是我在收听电台转播的实况录音时，感到您就在我的眼前。我是做林业工作的，当您来到中国时，我正在祖国北部风沙交加的草原地带参加植树工作，绿化祖国。我愿以最精心细致的心情把树栽好，让它生长繁茂，迅速成林，让它做为您到中国友好访问的纪念，让它成为中苏永恒友谊的象征。
                  吉林省的一个林业工人　时可望
    伟大苏联元首伏罗希洛夫主席访问我国，敬赋五古四十六韵，以志景仰，并博伏罗希洛夫主席一粲
