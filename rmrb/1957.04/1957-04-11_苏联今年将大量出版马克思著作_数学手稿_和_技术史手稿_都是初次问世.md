Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 10th. The Soviet Union will publish a large number of Marx's works this year, including the previously unpublished "Mathematical Manuscripts" and "Manuscripts on the History of Technology." This was stated by a responsible person from the Institute of Marxism-Leninism under the Central Committee of the CPSU at a recent press conference.

Since 1917, nearly 60 million copies of Marx's works have been printed in the Soviet Union in 68 languages. In order to meet the needs of the people, the second edition of the complete works of Marx and Engels will continue to be published this year, and selections on various topics will be prepared for publication, such as "On Religion," "On Proletarian Internationalism," "On Colonialism," and "On the National Liberation Movement in India."

Marx had a profound understanding of mathematics and his own unique insights into many mathematical problems. His "Mathematical Manuscripts" will be published at the end of this year. Prior to this, only a few fragments of his "Mathematical Manuscripts" had been published.

    苏联今年将大量出版马克思著作
    “数学手稿”和“技术史手稿”都是初次问世
    新华社莫斯科10日电　苏联今年将大量出版马克思的著作，其中包括从未发表过的“数学手稿”和“技术史手稿”。这是苏共中央马克思—列宁主义研究院的负责人士在最近举行的记者招待会上说的。
    从1917年以来，马克思的著作在苏联用六十八种文字印行了将近六千万册。为了满足人民的需要，今年将继续出版马克思恩格斯全集第二版，并且准备出版各种专题的选集，如“论宗教”、“论无产阶级国际主义”、“论殖民主义”、“论印度民族解放运动”等。
    马克思对数学有精深的研究，对许多数学问题有自己独特的见解。他的“数学手稿”将在今年年底出版。在这以前，他的“数学手稿”只发表过几个片断。
