    Workers' Families, Return to the Agricultural Cooperatives!
    To the Editors:
    After hearing the instructions from the CCP Central Committee and the State Council on doing a good job in spring plowing and striving for a bumper agricultural harvest in 1957, the broad masses of peasants in Tanghe County, Henan Province, were all jubilant and inspired. At present, many farmers are working actively to strive for this year's bumper harvest.
    However, under the circumstances of urgent spring plowing tasks and a lack of labor, there are many workers' families who have resided in the cities for a long time and have almost become detached from agricultural production. These people rely entirely on the wages of their husbands or relatives for their livelihoods and rarely do anything. According to preliminary investigations, there are 701 workers' families who have flowed into the towns in Tanghe County. The vast majority of these people are skilled in production, and some used to be the backbone of agricultural production leadership. If they return to their villages to participate in production, based on the general attendance of commune members, each person can add 140 workdays per year. In agricultural production, this would increase the labor force by 98,140 workdays. If the value of a workday is calculated at 6 jiao, this would increase the country's wealth by 588,840 yuan per year. Therefore, we suggest that worker comrades respond to the call of the Party Central Committee to strive for a bumper agricultural harvest this year, and mobilize their relatives to return to their villages to participate in agricultural production.
      (Rural Work Department Communication Group of the Tanghe County CCP Committee)
    To the Editors: Now is the tense season of spring plowing, but there are many workers' families in the countryside who are unwilling to participate in production and are flowing into the cities. As far as I know, the People's Court of Ningxiang County, Hunan Province, currently has two cadres' family members who are both members of the Communist Youth League. They were originally the backbone members of the agricultural cooperative and were good laborers among the women. But since they came to the county seat, they have become idle and doing nothing. The children and housework are left to the grandmother to manage, and they spend their days beautifying themselves, wandering around the east street, and walking around the west street, only going to the mass amateur school for a while every morning or evening to study culture.
    I believe that despising labor production and being content with a leisurely life are incompatible with the qualities of the working people and members of the Communist Youth League. I hope that worker comrades will persuade and educate family members who have this kind of thinking and encourage them to quickly return to their villages to participate in agricultural production.

### 职工家属回到农业社去！

    职工家属回到农业社去！编辑同志：
    河南省唐河县广大农民听了中共中央、国务院关于做好春耕工作、争取1957年农业大丰收的指示以后，无不欢欣鼓舞。目前，许多农民都为争取今年的大丰收而积极地劳动着。
    但在这春耕任务紧迫，而又缺乏劳动力的情况下，却有许多职工家属，长期寄居城市，几乎和农业生产脱离了关系。这些人完全是依靠自己的丈夫或亲人的工资生活，很少有什么事情。据初步调查，唐河县农村中流入城镇的职工家属即有七百零一人。这些人当中绝大部分是生产能手，还有些人过去是领导农业生产的骨干。他们如果回乡参加生产，按照社员一般的出勤情况，每人一年以一百四十个劳动日计算，在农业生产中就能增加九万八千一百四十个劳动日的劳动力量，劳动日值若按六角计算，一年即可给国家增加五十八万八千八百四十元的财富。因此，我们建议职工同志们响应党中央提出争取今年农业大丰收的号召，动员自己的亲人，回乡参加农业生产。
      （中共唐河县委农村工作部通讯组）
    编辑同志：现在正是紧张的春耕季节，农村中却有许多职工家属，不愿参加生产而流入城市。据我所知，湖南省宁乡县人民法院，现在有两个干部家属，都是青年团员，她们原来都是农业社的骨干分子，在妇女群众中是很好的劳动力。但自从她们来到县城以后，却变成游手好闲、无所事事的人了。孩子和家务交给婆婆管，她们每天除了修饰，便是东街逛逛，西街走走，只在每天早晨或晚上到群众业余学校去学习一会文化。
    我认为，轻视劳动生产，安于悠闲的生活，这与劳动人民和青年团员的品质是不相容的。希望职工同志们对待有这种思想的家属们，进行说服教育，鼓励她们赶快回乡参加农业生产。　（小子）
