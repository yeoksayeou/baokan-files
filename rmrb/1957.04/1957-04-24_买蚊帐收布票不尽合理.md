    Requiring Cloth Ration Coupons for Mosquito Nets is Unreasonable
    Chongqing has a lot of mosquitoes, and mosquito nets are essential to get through the summer. In the past, buying mosquito nets did not require cloth ration coupons, but now they do (a large mosquito net requires 2.1 *zhang* of cloth ration coupons, and even the smallest requires 0.7 *zhang*). However, the state did not include mosquito net cloth when pre-issuing the ration coupons, so why is it necessary to purchase them with coupons now? We don't have many cloth ration coupons left, and the second phase of coupons will also be used at half value, making it difficult to buy mosquito nets. We hope that the commercial departments will reconsider this.　Nan Shouren, Yang Xiu

    买蚊帐收布票不尽合理
    重庆蚊子顶多，夏季要有蚊帐才过得去。过去，买蚊帐规定不收布票，现在却要收布票了（一床大蚊帐要收布票二丈一尺，最小的也需要七尺）。但是国家在预发布票时并没有把蚊帐布计算在内，为什么现在又要凭票购买？我们手头的布票都不多了，第二期布票还要对折使用，买蚊帐确有困难。希望商业部门重新考虑。　南守仁、杨秀
