Both of These Practices are Wrong

The Worthless Cattle That Should Be Slaughtered Are Not Allowed To Be
　　In early March, the Lianjiang County Committee of Fujian Province conducted a comprehensive inspection of the sick, disabled, old, and weak cattle that should be eliminated from the agricultural cooperatives. According to reports from various districts, townships, and cooperatives, there were still about 1,500 such cattle in the county that should be eliminated because they were disabled, old, or small and unable to plow the fields after being raised for several years, accounting for 9.7% of the county's existing cattle. Many cooperative cadres are often torn between two difficult situations because of the heavy burden of not being able to dispose of the worthless cattle: on the one hand, the cooperative bears a heavy economic burden, and regardless of whether the cattle can plow the fields, someone has to watch and feed them every day. On the other hand, they are worried that if the old, weak, and worthless cattle die, they will be criticized by their superiors for not doing a good job of protecting the cattle. The annual wage for watching and feeding a cow is at least 500 jin of grain; if we calculate based on 1,500 heads, the county's agricultural cooperatives would have to spend 750,000 jin of grain on the wages for feeding worthless cattle throughout the year, occupying the value that semi-laborers can create by participating in labor, and this does not even include the estimated value. According to Chen Changshun, the head of the Mupu Agricultural Cooperative, they had twelve worthless cattle last year, and the wages for watching the cattle alone, excluding feed, amounted to 6,000 jin of grain. If this were distributed to the members, each household could receive an extra twenty or thirty jin. Saving the labor used to feed worthless cattle and putting it into agricultural production could further increase income.
　　Worthless cattle not only increase the cooperative's expenses, but also take up the fodder for the plowing cattle, making the already insufficient feed seem even scarcer. This is also one of the reasons why some cooperatives currently lack fodder and the plowing cattle are weak. The serious problem is that many cooperatives currently have very little fodder, and since the beginning of spring, there has been continuous rain, making it impossible to drive the cattle to the mountains for grazing. The limited fodder has to be shared by both the plowing cattle and the worthless cattle, so the fodder is even more scarce.
　　Why should we let the disabled, old, and worthless cattle that can no longer be used for labor consume artificial feed and add an extra burden to the agricultural cooperatives? When farmers travel five or six li or thirty or forty li back and forth to take the cattle that should be eliminated to the designated approval authority, the district office, for approval and slaughter, some cadres meet the worthless cattle, some do not, and without knowing what kind of cattle they are, they say, "Take them back, don't slaughter them, that's a plowing cattle." A worthless cow from the Lianxing Cooperative in Mupu Township was taken to the district for approval and slaughter three times, traveling twenty li back and forth each time, but it was not approved. The members were so angry that they asked the cooperative director to send the cow to the government to raise. If the government didn't want it, they would take it back to the cooperative and "provide for it for the rest of its life." This year, agricultural cooperatives in the county generally lack production funds. If they could quickly dispose of those worthless cattle, it would not only reduce the cooperative's expenses, but also increase production funds by nearly 100,000 yuan. The county committee attached great importance to the disposal of worthless cattle. In previous production meetings last winter and this spring, they made arrangements for the protection of plowing cattle and the elimination of worthless cattle; and designated Chen, the manager of the county food company, to make a plan for slaughtering them in batches. However, when the financial and trade department of the county committee went to the food company on March 18 to check on the progress of the disposal, Manager Chen of the company said: I haven't made any arrangements yet!

Good Cattle That Should Not Be Slaughtered Were Slaughtered
　　In the fourth quarter of 1956, the Wuhu City Food Company in Anhui Province transferred a large number of cattle from other places to meet the market's need for meat. After inspection by the local veterinary quarantine department, due to the failure of some purchasing personnel of the food company to strictly follow the national slaughter standards for purchasing, a large number of pregnant cows and calves were purchased. For example, among the 100 cows transferred from the Jiashan County Company of the Bengbu area, 21 were found to be pregnant. Due to the dereliction of duty by the staff of the city food company, some of the cows were slaughtered without inspection. In addition, 13 calves were transferred from the Guangde County Company. These calves were mostly three to four years old, and three of them were pregnant heifers. Although these cattle were not very strong, they could still be used if their feeding and management were strengthened. The local veterinary inspection department promptly made a suggestion to the city food company, requesting that they try to return these pregnant and young animals to their original units for decentralized feeding and strengthen their feeding and management. This suggestion failed to attract the attention of the company's leaders. Now, of these pregnant animals, except for seven that have been sold, most of the rest have suffered from poor feeding and management. One has died of emaciation, and eight have been slaughtered one after another. The slaughtered pregnant cows were generally pregnant for up to nine months, and the larger fetal calves weighed 30 jin. Two of them gave birth, but due to poor management, the calves died quickly. The remaining pregnant cows and calves are all infected with mange, their hair has fallen out, and they are extremely emaciated. Now, these calves have all been scrapped and are urgently awaiting slaughter (except for the pregnant animals). To date, there are still six pregnant animals struggling on the verge of death.
　　The company currently has a batch of bulls, which, although they have reached the slaughter standard in terms of age, are strong and powerful and can still be used for labor. Recently, many farmers have come to the company with letters of introduction from the local government to negotiate purchases for use, but the company has refused to sell them, citing the need to supply the market. This attitude of the company is contrary to the spirit of the "Instructions on the Issue of Draught Animals" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council. More seriously, the company has still not changed this situation until now. On March 23, they slaughtered a pregnant cow that the veterinary inspection agency had inspected and disagreed with slaughtering. The fetal calf in its belly was about eight months old and weighed 27 jin.

    这两种做法都不对
    该杀的废牛不让杀
    3月初，福建连江县委对农业社应该淘汰的病残老弱的废牛进行了一次全面检查。据各区、乡、社汇报统计，全县还有应该淘汰的残老和体型小养了几年不能耕田的废牛一千五百头左右，占全县现有耕牛的9.7％。许多社干部常常为废牛不能处理的沉重包袱压得两头为难：一头是社里经济上负担重，不管它能不能耕田，每天总得要有人看它、养它。另一头为难是如果老弱废牛死掉，又要受上级批评，指谪护牛工作没做好。一头牛的全年看养工资，最少也要五百斤粮食；该县农业社全年付出养废牛的工资，按一千五百头计算，就要支出七十五万斤粮食，占用去半劳力参加劳动所能创造的价值，还没有估算进去。据幕浦农业社社长陈昌顺对我说，他们社里去年十二头废牛，饲料不算，仅支出看牛工资就达六千斤粮食。如分给社员，每户还能多分二三十斤。把饲养废牛的劳力节省下来投入农业生产，还能更多增加收入。
    废牛不仅给社里增加开支，而且占了耕牛的草料，使本来够吃的饲料就显得不够了。这也是目前有些社草料不够，耕牛瘦弱的原因之一。严重问题是目前不少社饲料已经很少，入春以来又多是阴雨连绵，不能把牛赶到野外山上放牧，仅有的饲料还得让耕牛和废牛分享，因此，饲料更形缺乏。
    为什么要让已经不能役用的残老废牛空耗人工饲料，给农业社增加一项额外负担呢？当农民经过往返一次五六里或三、四十里，把应该淘汰的废牛牵到指定批准机关区公所审批宰杀的时候，有的干部还和废牛见个面，有的不见面，也不知道是什么牛，就说“拉回去吧，不准杀，那是一头耕牛”。幕浦乡联星社一头废牛牵到区上去批宰往返一次二十里，先后三次还没有批准，气得社员叫社主任把牛送给政府养，如果政府不要，再拿回社里“五保”起来。今年该县农业社普遍缺乏生产资金，如能迅速把那批废牛处理了，不仅可以减少社里开支，而且能够增加生产资金近十万元。县委对处理废牛十分重视，去冬今春在历次生产会议上，都布置了保护耕牛和淘汰废牛的工作；并指定县食品公司陈经理做出计划，分批宰杀。但是，3月18日县委财贸部去食品公司检查处理情况的时候，该公司陈经理却说：还没有布置下去呢！　　　　　　　田凤云
    不该杀的好牛杀了
    安徽省芜湖市食品公司，在1956年第四季度由外地调入大量的牛，供应市场肉食需要。经当地兽医检疫部门检验，由于食品公司某些收购人员未能认真遵照国家颁布的屠宰标准进行收购，以致收进了大批的怀孕母牛及小牛。像蚌埠专区的嘉山县公司调来的一百头母牛，经检查，其中怀孕的有二十一头。由于市食品公司工作人员的失职，有一部分母牛未经检查就宰杀了。另由广德县公司调来小牛十三只，这批牛的年龄大都在三岁至四岁，其中并有三头已怀孕的小母牛。这批牛虽然体格不大强壮，但一般经加强其饲养管理，仍可使役。当地兽医检验部门曾及时地向市食品公司提出建议，要求设法把这批孕畜幼畜尽量退回原单位分散饲养，加强饲养管理，这个建议未能引起该公司领导人员的重视。现在，这批孕畜除已出售七头外，其余大部分由于饲养管理不好，一头已瘦弱死亡，并先后宰杀八头。宰杀的孕牛一般已怀胎大至九个月，胎牛体重较大的已有三十斤。其中有二头分娩后管理不善，牛犊很快死亡。所余部分孕牛幼牛，全部感染疥癣，毛已脱落，瘦弱不堪。现在这批小牛已全部报废急宰（孕畜除外）。到目前止，仍有六头孕畜在死亡边缘上挣扎着。
    该公司现有一批公牛，年龄虽已达宰杀标准，但其体格强壮有力，仍可役使。日前多次有农民持当地政府介绍信来该公司洽购使用，但该公司都以供应市场为理由拒绝售给。该公司这种态度，是同中共中央和国务院“关于耕畜问题的指示”的精神相违背的。更严重的是，直到现在，该公司仍然没有改变这种情况。3月23日，经兽医检验机关检验不同意宰杀的一头孕牛，他们仍然自行宰杀，肚里所怀胎牛已达八个月左右，体重已有二十七斤。　　　　　　艾　群（附图片）
    看，这就是芜湖市食品公司所饲养的公牛，该杀吗？
