    Hunan Province's Shrike-babblers Sold Worldwide

    "We currently need a large quantity of live birds...If we can import directly, we guarantee to place large orders with you," wrote Mr. De Jardin, manager of the Canalrea Company in Brussels, Belgium, in a letter to the China National Native Produce Export Corporation. This letter has now been forwarded to the Hunan Provincial Branch of the China National Native Produce Export Corporation. Last year alone, more than 60,000 shrike-babblers from Pingjiang, Hunan, were sold abroad, with sales regions spanning the globe.

    Hunan Province's minor native products were mainly trial-sold abroad starting last year. Last year, the foreign exchange earned from their exports could purchase 260,000 tons of fertilizer or more than 100,000 tons of steel for the country. In addition to shrike-babblers, other items such as small birds and beasts, aquatic insects, large bamboo leaves, dried chili peppers, Job's tears, wild lilies, arrowhead powder, water caltrop seeds, litsea cubeba, red roots, moxa wool, and loofah sponges are also popular in the international market. Aquatic insects, also known as water fleas, grow in water and grow extremely rapidly after spring rains; one dan of dried aquatic insects can be exchanged for thirty-two dan of fertilizer. Litsea cubeba is a wild plant that is produced in mountains and forests throughout the province; its outer skin contains volatile oil with a strong fragrance and is a good raw material for cosmetics. At least 1,000 tons can be harvested annually, which can increase the income of farmers throughout the province by 400,000 yuan.

### 湖南省相思鸟遍销全球

    湖南省相思鸟遍销全球
    “我们目前需要的是大量的活鸟……倘使我们能直接进口，保证向你们订大批的货。”比利时布鲁塞尔卡纳雷阿公司经理德·贾丁给中国土产出口公司的信里这样写道。这封信现在已转到了中国土产出口公司湖南省公司。去年一年，湖南平江的相思鸟就外销六万多只，销售地区遍及全球。
    湖南省的次小土产试销国外，主要是从去年开始的。去年一年他们出口的东西换回的外汇，可为国家购回肥田粉二十六万吨，或钢材十多万吨。除相思鸟外，其他如小鸟小兽、鱼虫子、大片竹叶、辣椒干、苡米、野百合、慈姑粉、菱角米、山苍子、红根、艾绒和丝瓜络等，在国际市场上也受到欢迎。鱼虫子又叫水虱，生长在水中，春季雨后生长极快，一担干鱼虫子能换回三十二担肥田粉。山苍子是一种野生植物，全省各地山林中都出产，外皮含挥发油，有浓烈香味，是化妆品的好原料，一年至少可采摘一千吨，能给全省农民增加四十万元的收入。
