Wenling County Implements Breed Improvement of Draft Cattle

(Reported by this newspaper) Wenling County, Zhejiang Province, in order to enhance the plowing capacity of draft animals and improve the quality and reproduction rate of young livestock, is now implementing breed improvement of draft cattle throughout the county.

According to statistics at the end of 1956, Wenling County had more than 19,000 head of draft cattle, including more than 9,200 cows and 57 bulls. However, due to the low breeding rate, only over 4,000 calves were bred last year (a breeding rate of 21.05% of the total number of cattle). The main reason for this was the poor quality of the breeding bulls.

In order to improve the quality of breeding bulls, the county leadership has taken two major measures:

First, the work of identifying and certifying breeding bulls was carried out. As a result of the identification, only thirty-five of the original fifty-seven breeding bulls were qualified. Second, improved breeds were introduced from other places. From April to June last year, fifteen Qinchuan cattle were purchased from Shaanxi, and six Dutch bulls were purchased from Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places. Now the county has fifty-six improved breed bulls, which is sufficient to meet the needs of cows for mating. Wenling County is about to fully launch the mating work, and it is estimated that 4,000 excellent calves will be produced this year. (Ye Churui)

    温岭县实行耕牛良种化
    本报讯　浙江省温岭县为了增强耕畜耕作能力，提高小畜的质量及其繁殖率，现在正在全县范围内实行耕牛良种化。
    据1956年底统计，温岭县有耕牛一万九千多头，其中母牛九千二百多头，公牛五十七头。但因繁殖率低，去年只繁殖小牛四千余头（繁殖率占总牛数21.05％），其主要原因是种公牛质量差。
    为了提高种公牛的质量，该县领导上采取了两大措施：
    首先开展了种公牛的鉴定发证工作。鉴定结果，在原有的五十七头种公牛中，合格的只有三十五头。其次，从外地引进良种。去年4—6月份，先后从陕西购进秦川牛十五头；从上海、南京等地买进荷兰种公牛六头。现在该县共有良种公牛五十六头，足够满足母牛配种的需要。现在温岭县即将全面开展配种工作，预计今年可产优良小牛四千头。　（叶楚儒）
