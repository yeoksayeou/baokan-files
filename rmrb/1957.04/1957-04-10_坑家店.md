    “Family-Harming Inn”
    Baojishan Coal Mine in Jingyuan County, Gansu Province, without going through the government, privately recruited thirty-two farmers from our Liangshuiyuan Township to work. The Liangshatan Production Team had only twelve able-bodied men, and eight were taken away, leaving mostly semi-able-bodied and sick people. In the Xiakou Team, the feeder, shepherd, warehouse keeper, and work point recorder were all gone. Because this mine indiscriminately recruits farmers, it has caused ideological unrest among some commune members. Wang Zonghe, the Party Branch Secretary of our Liangshuiyuan Township, personally discussed the matter with the leaders of this mine, urging the commune members to return home to production. However, the leaders of this mine not only did not assist but also hindered them in every possible way and refused to pay wages. Some commune members wanted to return home, but because they had no travel expenses, they had to stay there and continue working, waiting to receive their wages. Therefore, people call them a "family-harming inn."

    “坑家店”
    甘肃靖远县宝积山煤矿不经过政府，私自从我们梁水园乡招收了三十二个农民去做工。梁沙滩生产队男全劳动力仅有十二人，就被拉去八人，剩下的大多是半劳动力和病号；峡门队的饲养员、放牧员、保管员、记工员全部走光。由于这个矿乱拉农民，惹起一部分社员思想动荡不安。我们梁水园乡党支部书记王宗和等，曾亲自跟这个矿的领导同志商量，动员社员回家生产。可是这个矿的领导同志，不但不进行协助，反而百般阻拦，不发给工资。有的社员愿意回家，因为没有路费，只好留在那里继续做工，等着领工资，所以，人们都说他们是“坑家店”。  王示  周生
