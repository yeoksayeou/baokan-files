Xinhua News Agency, April 28th: According to a report by the Yugoslav News Agency on the 27th, the Yugoslav Federal National Assembly meeting, which opened on the 25th, after listening to and discussing the report on agricultural issues by Komar, a member of the Federal Executive Council, passed a resolution on the prospects for the development of agriculture and cooperative activities on the afternoon of the 27th.

The resolution stipulates that the basic goal of Yugoslavia's future agricultural policy is to modernize agriculture, develop socialist relations in rural areas, and adjust the pace of agricultural development with other economic sectors.

The resolution stipulates that agricultural production in the next five years should increase by 30% to 35% compared with the average output between 1951 and 1955. In terms of wheat production, the average yield of wheat per hectare should increase by about 50% in the next six to seven years, so that Yugoslavia will no longer have to import wheat from foreign countries. (Note: According to materials from the second issue of "New Era" magazine in 1957: Yugoslavia lacks 600,000 to 650,000 tons of wheat each year, and production decreased by 12% in 1956 compared to 1955. The deficit mainly relies on foreign imports.)

The resolution emphasizes that Yugoslavia's small peasant economy farms cannot bear this task. Years of practice and experience have shown that to achieve modernized agriculture and develop new technologies, it is necessary to develop socialist cooperation.

The resolution states that the essence of Yugoslavia's policy in agriculture is to gradually socialize the process of production and expanded reproduction in agriculture by developing basic means of production within agricultural cooperatives and other socialist agricultural organizations, while not infringing on the individual ownership of land. (Note: According to the same materials mentioned above: Currently, peasant households participating in agricultural cooperatives in Yugoslavia account for 4% to 4.5% of the total number of peasant households. 95% of peasant households are small land operators. Yugoslav law stipulates that the land cultivated by a cultivator shall not exceed ten hectares, equivalent to 150 Chinese mu.)

In the future, socialist large farms should strive to increase production by two to three times. To this end, they should gradually develop towards production specialization, be equipped with modern technical equipment, and own more livestock.

In the next six to seven years, livestock should be increased by about 50%.

The resolution calls for greater investment in agriculture, first of all for industry to produce more means of production for agricultural production and to expand activities serving agriculture.

    促进农业现代化　逐步社会主义化
    南议会规定农业发展前景
    新华社28日讯　据南斯拉夫通讯社27日报道：25日开幕的南斯拉夫联邦国民议会会议，在听取并且讨论了联邦执行委员会委员科马尔的农业问题报告以后，27日下午通过了关于农业和合作社活动发展前景的决议。
    决议规定南斯拉夫今后农业政策的基本目的是使农业现代化、发展农村中的社会主义关系和调整农业同其他经济部门发展的步调。
    决议规定：今后五年内的农业生产应该比1951—1955年间的平均产量提高30％到35％。在小麦生产方面，今后六、七年内小麦每公顷平均产量应提高50％左右，这样将使南斯拉夫不必再从外国输入小麦。（注：据1957年第二期“新时代”杂志材料：南斯拉夫每年缺小麦六十到六十五万吨，1956年比1955年减产12％。缺额主要依靠国外输入。）
    决议着重指出，南斯拉夫的小农经济农场是不可能负担这个任务的。多年的实践和经验表明：要实现现代化的农业和发展新技术，就必须发展社会主义合作。
    决议说，南斯拉夫在农业方面的政策的实质是通过在农业合作社和其他社会主义农业组织内发展基本的生产手段，使农业中的生产和扩大再生产的过程逐步社会主义化，而同时又不致侵犯土地的个人所有制。（注：根据上述同一材料：现在南斯拉夫参加农业合作社的农户占总农户的4％到4.5％。95％的农户都是小额土地经营者。南斯拉夫的法律规定：耕种者的土地不得超过十公顷，合我国150市亩。）
    在将来，社会主义大农场应该努力把生产提高两三倍。为此，它们应该逐渐向生产专业化方向发展，配备以现代化的技术设备和拥有更多的牲畜。
    在今后六、七年中，应该把牲畜增加50％左右。
    决议要求对农业作更大的投资，首先是工业为农业生产更多的生产资料以及扩大为农业服务的活动。
