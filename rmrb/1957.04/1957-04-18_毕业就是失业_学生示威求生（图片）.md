"Graduation equals unemployment" is a portrayal of the tragic situation faced by Japanese students today.

Japanese youth are unwilling to accept such a fate and are holding demonstrations demanding work. High school graduates in Kumamoto City are riding bicycles, with slogans such as "Give us graduates work" posted on them, patrolling everywhere to attract social attention.
