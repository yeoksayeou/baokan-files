Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, April 4th. The more than three thousand agricultural implement repair stations scattered throughout the rural towns and townships of Sichuan Province have extensively launched repair work on old agricultural implements during the spring plowing production.

This year, agricultural cooperatives and farmers in various parts of Sichuan Province have added fewer new agricultural implements but have repaired more old agricultural implements. In order to adapt to this new situation, many areas, in addition to the original repair stations, have also temporarily extracted some handicraft workers to participate in the repair business of old agricultural implements. In addition to strengthening the leadership of the original thirty repair stations and groups, Nanchong County also added repair groups in larger towns to form a county-wide agricultural implement repair network. Luxian County also temporarily organized a group of urban workers to go to the countryside to help farmers repair agricultural implements in order to make up for the shortage of repair workers.

Agricultural implement repair stations in various places have established contact with local farmers and carried out repairs in a timely manner according to their needs. In Huayang, Suining and other counties, some repair stations have signed contracts with nearby agricultural cooperatives for the regular repair of agricultural implements. The Jiangjin County Handicraft Industry Cooperative also organized its members in advance to study the repair technology of old agricultural implements, requiring that quality be improved and costs reduced during repairs.

The development of the old agricultural implement repair business not only saved farmers the cost of purchasing new agricultural implements, but also saved farmers the time it took to travel back and forth between towns and townships to deliver and pick up the implements, and is therefore generally welcomed by farmers.

    四川农村场镇的三千多个农具修配站
    广泛展开破旧农具修理工作
    新华社成都4日电　散布在四川省各地农村场镇的三千多个农具修配站，在春耕生产中广泛展开了破旧农具修理工作。
    四川省今年各地农业社和农民添置新农具较少，而修配旧农具较多。为了适应这一新情况，许多地区除原有修配站外，还临时抽出部分手工业工人，参加旧农具的修配业务。南充县除加强原有三十个修配站、组的领导外，并在较大的场镇增添了修配小组，形成全县农具修配网。泸县还临时组织了一部分城市工人，下乡帮助农民修理农具，以弥补修配工人的不足。
    各地农具修配站都和当地农民取得了联系，根据他们的需要，及时地进行修理。华阳、遂宁等县，有的修配站和附近农业社订立了定期修配农具的合同。江津县手工业联合社，事先并组织社员研究了旧农具的修理技术，要求在修理中作到提高质量，降低成本。
    旧农具修配业务的开展，不仅为农民节省了添置新农具的费用，而且节省了农民往返乡镇间的送取时间，因而普遍受到农民的欢迎。（附图片）
