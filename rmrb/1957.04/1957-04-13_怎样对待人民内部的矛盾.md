How to Treat Contradictions Among the People

From February 27 to March 1, the Supreme State Conference, attended by more than 1,800 people, listened to Chairman Mao Zedong's report on the correct handling of contradictions among the people and held heated discussions. Subsequently, the meeting of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference held from March 5 to 20, and the National Propaganda Work Conference convened by the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China from March 6 to March 13, with the participation of more than 800 ideological workers from both inside and outside the Party, both focused on discussing this report. On March 12, Comrade Mao Zedong spoke at the National Propaganda Work Conference, and the content of his speech, in addition to issues concerning other aspects of the ideological front, was also related to the issue of correctly understanding and handling contradictions among the people. Subsequently, meetings convened by the central organizations of the various democratic parties and meetings convened by many local organizations of the Communist Party of China also discussed this topic. Therefore, how to correctly treat contradictions among the people has become one of the issues of general concern to people from all walks of life across the country. The widespread discussion of this issue will undoubtedly promote the relatively smooth resolution of certain contradictions among the people in our country, consolidate the great unity of our people, and thus accelerate the development of our country's socialist cause.

How should we understand and treat contradictions among the people?

We believe that contradiction is the driving force for the development and progress of all things. From the Marxist point of view, the existence of contradictions within things is a universal and eternal phenomenon. On the contrary, it would be a great absurdity to say that there are no contradictions within things.

In class society, contradictions and struggles constantly exist between mutually hostile classes. When a certain mode of production seriously hinders the development of productive forces, the contradictions and struggles between the reactionary class representing the old mode of production and the revolutionary class demanding a new mode of production become particularly acute, until the reactionary class is overthrown and a new mode of production is established, and this contradiction and struggle will basically end. Under the new social system, new contradictions and struggles will arise again. In the development of human society, although the situation and nature of internal contradictions in society vary due to different social systems, the existence of contradictions is forever不变.

After heroic struggles, our people overthrew the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism in 1949 and established a strong people's democratic dictatorship. Then, after a series of great endeavors, the basic completion of the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce was basically achieved in 1956. Therefore, on a national scale, the history of large-scale class struggle between the enemy and ourselves has basically ended, that is to say, the contradiction between the enemy and ourselves, which had long been the main contradiction in the country, has been basically resolved. Our productive forces will develop rapidly under the new socialist relations of production. Within our people, such as within the working class, within the peasant class, between workers and peasants, and among the people of all nationalities, a great unity has been formed. Based on their own personal experience, the people have realized that the Communist Party and the People's Government are working hard for the interests of the people, and that there is a fundamental consistency between the people and their leaders. This consistency is unimaginable in class society.

However, this does not mean that there are no more contradictions among the people in socialist society. On the contrary, in the process of development of socialist society, between the productive forces and the relations of production, between the superstructure and the economic base, and in all aspects of the economic and political systems, there will still be situations of incomplete adaptation, that is, contradictions will still arise. Among the people, between advanced elements and backward elements, between people holding correct opinions and attitudes and people holding wrong opinions and attitudes, between this part of the masses and that part of the masses, and between the people and their leaders, there are also such and such contradictions.

We intend to focus here on the issue of contradictions between the people and their leaders. This is because the various guidelines, policies, and specific measures of our Party and the state in building socialism must be implemented among the people by leaders at all levels. The people are managed by these leaders in many aspects of production and life, and many of their demands and needs can only be met through these leaders. Therefore, many contradictions in our society are often concentratedly expressed through contradictions between the people and their leaders.

Why do contradictions arise between the people and their leaders? This is determined by the different positions they occupy in national life. The people directly participate in productive labor, mainly physical labor, and generally find it difficult to directly exercise management power. This position makes it easier for them to observe problems from the local situation at the time, to pay attention to current interests and partial interests, and more difficult to understand the entire situation and all the difficulties in the entire socialist construction. On the other hand, leaders directly exercise management power and generally find it difficult to participate in physical labor. They are more likely to see long-term interests and overall interests, and more likely to neglect the specific situation and immediate needs of the people.

However, the contradictions between the people and their leaders, like other contradictions among the people, are non-antagonistic contradictions that arise on the basis of a fundamental identity of interests, and are completely unlike the contradictions between the enemy and ourselves, which are antagonistic contradictions that arise on the basis of a fundamental conflict of interests. The methods for handling contradictions among the people must be distinguished in principle from the methods for handling contradictions between the enemy and ourselves. In order to correctly handle such contradictions, it is necessary to proceed from the desire for unity, and after criticism or struggle, to achieve a new unity on a new basis. Here, starting from the desire for unity is decisive, because without this desire, criticism and struggle will be difficult to achieve a new unity. We will discuss this issue in more detail on another occasion.

At present, the main contradiction between the people and their leaders in our country is due to the bureaucratic style of leaders in their work. Some leading cadres neither understand the situation below nor listen to the opinions of the masses; many things that should be done and can be done are delayed, and problems that should be solved and can be solved are left unresolved; they even rudely suppress the opinions and demands of the masses and rudely infringe upon the rights and interests of the masses. Although such seriously bureaucratic leading cadres account for only a small number in our Party and the People's Government, as long as their bureaucratic style has not been discovered and corrected, they will inevitably arouse legitimate dissatisfaction among the broad masses. Therefore, in order to resolve the contradictions between the people and their leaders, it is necessary to first seriously and conscientiously overcome this bureaucratic phenomenon among leading cadres.

In order to effectively overcome bureaucracy, it is necessary to rely on the masses and expand the democratic life of the people in order to strengthen the supervision of leaders by the masses. Due to the victory of socialist transformation, the vast majority of the masses across the country have been organized, and their enthusiasm for participating in the management of state affairs and collective undertakings has also increased. This is a favorable condition for realizing further democratization of the country and expanding the democratic life of the people. Under such circumstances, whether it is agricultural cooperatives, handicraft cooperatives, state-owned enterprises, joint state-private enterprises, government agencies, or schools, it is necessary to actively expand democratic life, improve various democratic systems, and promote a highly democratic style. For example, the members' congresses and members' representative congresses in cooperatives, the workers' representative congresses in enterprises, and the regular meetings of staff and workers in government agencies and faculty, staff, and students in schools should be regularized and give full play to the role of these meetings. In all these meetings, it is necessary to create an atmosphere in which the masses can truly freely express their opinions and are willing to express their opinions, to open up avenues of speech, and to truly realize the requirements of "saying everything you know, saying everything without reservation, the speaker is not guilty, and the listener should take it as a warning." Leaders should not only listen to the opinions of the masses, but also seriously deal with them. Regardless of whether the opinions of the masses are correct or feasible, leaders must study them and respond. Those that are correct and feasible should be accepted and implemented; those that are not feasible or temporarily not feasible should also be publicly explained. It is not allowed to ignore the opinions of the masses, or to perfunctorily prevaricate, nor to make random promises or pander to the public. Here, it is especially important that if the problems raised in the criticisms of the masses are indeed due to the mistakes of the leaders, then the leaders should resolutely and bravely admit their mistakes to the masses, and should not shirk their responsibilities to those above, below, left, and right. Experience has proved that admitting mistakes to the masses in a down-to-earth manner will not lose one's prestige; on the contrary, those who evade their responsibilities and use deception and high-handed methods to protect their "prestige" will inevitably go bankrupt in front of the masses in the end, even if they succeed for a while. In any unit, as long as the masses have normal democratic life, and the leaders can actively approach the masses and share weal and woe with the masses, then even if the objective conditions are more difficult, the contradictions between the masses and the leaders can be resolved smoothly.

In order to completely resolve the contradictions between the people and their leaders, it is also necessary to continuously strengthen ideological and political work among the masses and continuously improve the political awareness of the people. For citizens in socialist society, without correct ideological and political viewpoints, they will not correctly understand the meaning of life and labor, they will not correctly understand the relationship between the individual and the collective, and the state, and they will not correctly understand the relationship between partial interests and overall interests, and current interests and long-term interests. In recent years, ideological and political education work for the masses has obviously been weakened in many places. Many of our leaders have been infected with the old habit of "wielding power as soon as they have it in their hands," using the method of simply relying on administrative orders to replace ideological and political work among the masses. This tendency of commandism is a manifestation of bureaucratic style. They often only want the masses to do this or that, but do not tell the masses why they should do this or that. They often simply hand over the tasks assigned by the higher authorities to the masses to complete, without educating the masses to understand what significance completing these tasks has for the country and for the masses themselves. They have mouths, but they do not go to the masses to publicize. Sometimes, when they do publicize, they also unilaterally exaggerate the favorable aspects of things, while concealing the difficult aspects of things, so that the masses finally feel that they have been deceived; or they exaggerate the difficult aspects of things, without pointing out the bright aspects of things, so that the masses fall into pessimism. Whether among workers, peasants, or intellectuals, many ideological confusions are due to the fact that leaders have neglected ideological and political work, and this ideological confusion will inevitably complicate the contradictions between the people and their leaders.

We have said before that the position of the masses in national life makes it inherently difficult to understand the situation and difficulties in the entire socialist construction. Therefore, when the leadership relaxes ideological and political education for the masses, it is only natural that some unhealthy ideological tendencies arise among the masses. The responsibility for this does not lie with the masses, but with the leadership. Leaders are called "leaders," of course, not only because they can direct the masses in action, but more importantly because they have the responsibility to clearly point out the direction and path of progress to the masses, so that the masses understand why they should move in this direction and why they should advance along this path. To strengthen ideological and political education for the masses, it is required that leaders of various units regularly make reports to the masses, talk with the masses, and correctly explain major world events and national events, especially to correctly explain all the immediate problems that the masses are concerned about.

In order to strengthen the leadership of ideological and political education work for the masses, party committees at all levels, especially the first secretaries of party committees, must take up this work, regularly understand the ideological situation among the masses, and solve the ideological problems among the masses. It is necessary to promote the leaders of all departments of the Party and state organs to do this, and not to entrust this work solely to the propaganda departments of the Party committees and the education departments of the government.

Facts have proved that the more leaders pay attention to overcoming bureaucracy, and the more they pay attention to ideological and political education for the masses, the smaller the contradictions among the people will be, and the easier they will be to resolve; on the contrary, the more serious the bureaucracy of the leaders is, or the weaker the ideological and political education among the masses is, the greater and more acute the internal contradictions will be. As long as we both strive to overcome bureaucracy and strive to strengthen ideological and political education for the masses, the contradictions between the people and their leaders will be resolved in a timely manner, and the unity of the people (first and foremost, the unity between the people and their leaders) will be constantly consolidated.

Our Party has flesh-and-blood ties with the broad masses of the people. This connection was established and consolidated by the Party in the process of carrying out arduous struggles with the masses for a long time. At the same time, our Party has accumulated a lot of valuable experience in correctly handling contradictions among the people. In the past, the Party has led the masses to overthrow all oppressors and successfully resolved various contradictions between the enemy and ourselves. In the future, as long as our Party can continue to guard against arrogance and rashness, closely connect with the masses, and resolutely fight against bureaucracy and other erroneous ideological styles, we will certainly be able to lead the masses to jointly overcome all difficulties and obstacles on the road to building socialism, and adopt correct methods to smoothly resolve various contradictions among the people.

    怎样对待人民内部的矛盾
    从2月27日到3月1日，有一千八百多人出席的最高国务会议听了毛泽东主席关于正确地处理人民内部矛盾的报告，并且进行了热烈的讨论。随后，在3月5日到20日举行的中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会的会议，和在3月6日到3月13日举行的、由中国共产党中央宣传部召集而有党内外思想工作者八百多人参加的全国宣传工作会议，都着重讨论了这个报告。3月12日，毛泽东同志在全国宣传工作会议上讲了话，讲话的内容除了关于思想战线的其他方面的问题以外，也同正确地认识和处理人民内部矛盾的问题有关。随后，在各民主党派的中央机构相继召集的会议上，在中国共产党的许多地方组织所召集的会议上，也都讨论到这一个题目。因此，怎样正确地对待人民内部的矛盾，已经成为全国各界人士当前普遍关心的问题之一。关于这个问题的广泛讨论，无疑将促进我国目前人民内部的某些矛盾得到比较顺利的解决，使我国人民的伟大团结更加巩固，从而使我国的社会主义事业更快地向前发展。
    我们应该怎样来认识和对待人民内部的矛盾呢？
    我们认为，矛盾是一切事物发展和进步的动力。从马克思主义的观点看来，事物内部存在着矛盾，这是一种普遍的、永恒的现象，相反，如果说，事物内部没有矛盾，倒是绝大的奇谈。
    在阶级社会中，互相敌对的阶级之间经常地存在着矛盾和斗争。当某一种生产关系严重地妨碍着生产力的发展的时候，代表旧生产关系的反动阶级和要求新生产关系的革命阶级之间的矛盾和斗争就要变得特别尖锐，直到反动阶级推翻了，新的生产关系建立起来了，这种矛盾和斗争才会基本上结束。而在新的社会制度之下，新的矛盾和斗争又会发生。在人类社会的发展中，由于社会制度的不同，社会内部矛盾的情况和矛盾的性质虽然有所不同，但是矛盾的存在这一点却是永远不变的。
    我国人民经过英勇的斗争，在1949年，推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的反动统治，建立了强有力的人民民主专政。接着，经过一系列的巨大的努力，在1956年基本上完成了对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。因此，就全国范围来说，敌我之间的大规模的阶级斗争的历史已经基本上结束，也就是说，曾经长期是国内主要矛盾的敌我之间的矛盾，已经基本上解决。我国生产力在新的社会主义的生产关系下面将得到迅速的发展。在我国人民内部，例如在工人阶级内部，农民阶级内部，在工人和农民之间，在各民族人民之间，都形成了伟大的团结。人民群众根据自己切身的经验，认识到共产党和人民政府是为人民的利益而努力工作的，认识到在人民群众和自己的领导者之间存在着根本上的一致。这种一致是阶级社会中所梦想不到的。
    但是，这并不是说，在社会主义社会中，人民内部就不再有矛盾了。相反，在社会主义社会的发展过程中，在生产力和生产关系之间，在上层建筑和经济基础之间，在经济制度和政治制度的各个环节上，仍然会产生不完全相适应的情况，也就是说，仍然会产生矛盾。在人民内部，在先进分子和落后分子之间，在抱着正确意见正确态度的人们和抱着错误意见错误态度的人们之间，在这一部分群众和那一部分群众之间，在人民群众和他们的领导者之间，也都存在着这样那样的矛盾。
    我们打算在这里着重地谈一下人民群众和他们的领导者之间的矛盾问题。这是因为，我们党和国家建设社会主义的各项方针、政策和具体措施必须通过各级领导者到人民群众中去贯彻执行，人民群众在生产中和生活中的很多方面是受着这些领导者管理的，而且他们的很多要求和需要也要通过这些领导者才能得到满足。因此，我们社会中的许多矛盾，往往通过人民群众和领导者之间的矛盾而集中地表现出来。
    人民群众和领导者之间为什么会发生矛盾？这是由于他们在国家生活中所处的不同的地位决定的。人民群众直接参加生产劳动，主要是体力劳动，而一般地难于直接行使管理权力。他们所处的这种地位，使他们比较容易从当时当地的局部情况去观察问题，比较容易重视目前利益和局部利益，而比较难于了解整个社会主义建设中的全部情况和全部困难。而在另一方面，领导者是直接行使管理权力而一般地难于参加体力劳动的。他们比较能够看到长远利益和整体利益，而比较容易疏忽人民群众的具体情况和切身要求。
    但是，人民群众和领导者之间的矛盾，跟人民内部的其他矛盾一样，是在根本利益相一致的基础上发生的非对抗性的矛盾，完全不像敌我之间的矛盾那样，是在根本利益相冲突的基础上发生的对抗性的矛盾。处理人民内部的矛盾的方法，必须从原则上跟处理敌我矛盾的方法区别开来。为了正确地处理这类矛盾，必须是从团结的愿望出发，经过批评或者斗争，在新的基础上达到新的团结。在这里，从团结的愿望出发是有决定意义的，因为如果没有这个愿望，批评和斗争就难于达到新的团结。关于这个问题，我们将在另外的机会再作比较详细的讨论。
    目前我国人民群众和领导者之间的矛盾，主要是由于领导者在工作中的官僚主义作风。某些领导工作人员自己既不了解下情，又不听取群众意见；许多该办而又能办的事拖着不办，该解决能解决的问题放着不解决；甚至粗暴地压制群众的意见和要求，粗暴地损害群众的权利和利益。这种严重地官僚化的领导工作人员虽然在我们党和人民政府中只占少数，但是只要他们的官僚主义作风没有被发现，被纠正，他们就必然引起广大群众的正当的不满。因此，为了解决人民群众和领导者之间的矛盾，必须首先严肃地认真地克服领导工作人员中的这种官僚主义现象。
    为了有效地克服官僚主义，必须依靠群众，扩大人民民主生活，以便加强群众对领导者的监督。由于社会主义改造的胜利，全国绝大多数群众已经组织起来，他们要求参与管理国家工作和集体事业的积极性也增长了。这是实现国家进一步民主化和扩大人民民主生活的有利条件。在这种情况下，不论是农业合作社、手工业合作社、国营企业、公私合营企业、机关和学校，都必须积极扩大民主生活，健全各种民主制度，发扬高度民主的作风。比如合作社中的社员大会和社员代表大会，企业中的职工代表大会，机关工作人员和学校教职员学生的定期会议，都应该经常化起来，充分发挥这些会议的作用。在所有这些会议中，都要造成一种让群众真正自由发表意见的空气和愿意发表意见的兴趣，广开言路，真正实现“知无不言，言无不尽，言者无罪，闻者足戒”的要求。领导者对群众的意见不仅要倾听，更要认真处理。不管群众的意见是否正确，能否办到，领导者都必须加以研究，作出答复。凡是正确可行的，应该接受执行；凡是不可行的或者暂时不可行的，也应该公开解释。对群众的意见既不允许置之不理，或者敷衍搪塞，也不能胡乱许愿，哗众取宠。在这里，尤其重要的是群众提出批评的问题如果确是由于领导者的错误，那么，领导者应该坚决地勇敢地向群众承认自己的错误，而不应该向上下左右去推诿。经验证明，向群众实事求是地承认错误，并不会丧失自己的威信；相反，回避自己责任的人，用欺骗和高压办法保护自己“威信”的人，即令成功于一时，最后仍然不可避免地要在群众面前破产。在任何一个单位中，只要群众有正常的民主生活，而领导者又能积极接近群众，跟群众同甘共苦，那么，那怕客观的条件再困难些，群众和领导者之间的矛盾也能够顺利地解决。
    为了完满地解决人民群众和领导者之间的矛盾，还需要不断地加强在群众中的思想政治工作，不断地提高人民群众的政治觉悟。对于社会主义社会中的公民来说，没有正确的思想政治观点，就不会正确地理解生活和劳动的意义，就不会正确地理解个人同集体、同国家的关系，就不会正确地理解局部利益和整体利益、目前利益和长远利益之间的关系。对于群众的思想政治教育工作，近年来在很多地方显然是削弱了。我们有不少的领导者，沾染了一种“一朝权在手，便把令来行”的旧习气，用单纯依靠行政命令的办法来代替对群众的思想政治工作。这种命令主义倾向正是官僚主义作风的一种表现。他们往往只是要群众这样干或那样干，并不告诉群众为什么要这样干或那样干。他们往往只把上级布置下来的任务简单地交群众去完成，而不教育群众去了解完成这些任务对国家和对群众自己有什么意义。他们长了嘴巴，却不到群众中去作宣传。有些时候，作起宣传来，也是片面地夸大事情的有利方面，而隐瞒事情的困难方面，使群众最后觉得是受了骗；或者夸大事情的困难方面，而不指出事情的光明方面，使群众陷入悲观。无论在工人中间、农民中间和知识分子中间，许多思想上的混乱都是由于领导者忽视了思想政治工作，而这种思想上的混乱必然使人民群众和领导者之间的矛盾复杂化起来。
    我们前面已经说过，群众在国家生活中所处的地位，本来难于了解整个社会主义建设中的情况和困难。因此，当领导上放松了对群众的思想政治教育的时候，群众中产生一些不良的思想倾向原是极自然的，这个责任不在群众，而在领导。领导者之所以被称为“领导者”，当然不只是因为他们可以在行动上指挥群众，更重要的还是因为他们有责任给群众透彻地指明前进的方向和道路，使群众了解为什么要向这个方向前进，为什么要沿这条道路前进。要加强对群众的思想政治教育，就要求各单位的领导人经常向群众作报告，跟群众谈话，要正确地讲解世界大事和国家大事，尤其要正确地讲解群众关心的一切切身问题。
    为了加强对群众思想政治教育工作的领导，各级党委，特别是党委的第一书记，必须把这一工作抓起来，经常了解群众中的思想情况，解决群众中的思想问题。要推动党和国家机关各个部门的领导人都这样作，而不要把这一工作仅仅委托给党委的宣传部门和政府的教育部门。
    事实证明，领导者愈是注意克服官僚主义，愈是注意对群众的思想政治教育，人民内部的矛盾就愈小，愈容易解决；相反，领导者的官僚主义愈严重，或者群众中的思想政治教育愈薄弱，内部矛盾就愈大，愈尖锐。只要我们既努力克服官僚主义，又努力加强对群众的思想政治教育，人民群众和领导者之间的矛盾就会及时地解决，而人民的团结（首先是人民群众和领导者之间的团结）就会不断地巩固。
    我们的党同广大人民群众有血肉一般的联系。这种联系是党在长期同群众在一起进行艰苦斗争的过程中建立和巩固起来的。同时，我们党已经积累了不少正确处理人民内部矛盾的宝贵经验。在过去，党已经领导群众推翻了一切压迫者，胜利地解决了各种敌我矛盾。在今后，只要我们党能够继续戒骄戒躁，密切联系群众，坚决地同官僚主义和其他错误的思想作风作斗争，我们也一定能够领导群众共同克服建设社会主义道路上的一切困难和障碍，并且采取正确的方法，顺利地解决各种人民内部的矛盾。
