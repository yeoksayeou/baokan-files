    Lenin in Moscow
    By Our Correspondent Li He
    Visitors to Moscow are always eager to go to Red Square. In the center of Red Square, in front of the Kremlin wall, stands the solemn Lenin-Stalin Mausoleum. Every day, hundreds of thousands of Soviet workers and people from all over the world visiting the Soviet Union come here to pay their respects. When you pass through Red Square and see the long queues of people paying their respects, when you see the Soviet people diligently studying Lenin's works and revisiting Lenin's simple, modest, and people-oriented, pragmatic style, you will feel that Lenin has always lived in people's hearts.
    On March 11, 1918, Lenin, along with the Soviet government, moved from Petrograd to Moscow. Two weeks after arriving in Moscow, Lenin instructed Kremlin administrator Markov to raise the red flag on the roof of the Soviet regime's headquarters—the All-Russian Central Executive Committee and the Council of People's Commissars. At Lenin's suggestion, the national time standard—the Kremlin's chimes—was repaired. After the clock struck six in the morning and twelve at night, people heard the stirring Internationale instead of the pre-revolutionary Tsarist Russian national anthem. It was not until late in the Soviet Patriotic War that the Soviet national anthem replaced the Internationale in the chimes.
    Lenin spent the last years of his life in Moscow. In Moscow, there are many places Lenin visited and many deeds he left behind. The Communist Youth League Theater next to Sverdlov Square is where Lenin delivered a speech at the Third Congress of the Communist Youth League. Here, Lenin issued the famous call to "study, study, and study again." The spirit of learning and continuing to advance, never being complacent, still inspires communists all over the world today.
    In Moscow, as in Petrograd, Lenin, as Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, had a great deal of work, but he always did it accurately and thoroughly. No matter how late he slept, he always started work at ten o'clock every morning, usually meeting with Yakov Sverdlov, Chairman of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee, to discuss matters. He worked until four or five o'clock in the afternoon before resting. He then worked from seven o'clock in the evening until two or three o'clock in the morning. Lenin's old friend Krzhizhanovsky recalled that Lenin's brain never rested. In his last years, he suffered from insomnia. Even after walking for hours before going to sleep, he still couldn't sleep. When others reminded him not to overwork, he said, "Isn't our cause worth working like this for?"
    Lenin's residence and office were both in the Kremlin. Like the Smolny Institute in Leningrad where he had lived, it was simple, with nothing but bookshelves filled with books. At that time, the Council of People's Commissars had only six rooms in total, one of which was Lenin's office. He did not allow his portraits to be hung in these rooms. His residence was adjacent to the rooms of the Council of People's Commissars, consisting of four simple small rooms where he lived with his wife and a sister. On the left side of his desk were three telephones. He often used the telephone for work. According to the old party member Stasova, Lenin rarely sent or received official documents. He asked people and himself not to play with official documents, and to try to deal with problems directly by telephone. Once, while taking a walk late at night, he noticed that the lights in some houses were on very late. He asked the administrator to check them in the evening and turn off their lights. He said, "We must persuade them not to waste electricity. We should save every kilogram of fuel, but they are shining brightly. We must stop this unsightly thing."
    After the October Revolution, food supply was very difficult. When Lenin was in the Smolny Institute, he often took his own lunch box to the cafeteria to get soup and porridge. In the Kremlin, Lenin still ate oatmeal porridge. After the Red Army captured Rostov, a grain-producing area, Commander Budyonny arrived in Moscow and brought Lenin many foods sent by the Red Army soldiers—flour, canned goods, sugar, etc.—and handed them to Lenin himself. Lenin thanked him and the next day gave all the gifts to the children of the nursery, while he himself continued to eat oatmeal porridge. On August 22, 1919, the Moscow Soviet's food department sent some fruit from the state farm to Lenin. The next day, Lenin replied: "I beg you not to do this in the future. Do not send fruit, etc. Please inform me of the following information: How is the fruit, etc., sent from the state farm generally distributed? Is it distributed to hospitals, sanatoriums, and children? To which places is it distributed, and how much?" Lenin only wanted to receive the rations of ordinary workers.
    Lenin was very concerned about his comrades. At that time, the spirit of hardship endured by the cadres was also moving. Tsyurupa, the People's Commissar for Food, fainted twice at meetings due to hunger and fatigue. Lenin initially wrote a letter gently advising him to recuperate for three weeks. When persuasion failed, Lenin had no choice but to issue an order: "Because Tsyurupa does not cherish state property (fainting twice), he is given his first warning and ordered to go home immediately."
    Lenin's modesty was consistent. Back in the days of the "St. Petersburg League of Struggle," there was an occasion when leaflets were to be printed, and Lenin and Krzhizhanovsky each prepared a draft. Lenin asked Krzhizhanovsky to read first. After listening, Lenin said, "Your draft is better, it can be used. Your draft has real driving force." Krivov, who served as a member of the Central Control Commission of the CPSU, recalled that once, an important staff member of the Moscow organization leaked unpublished government decisions. Krivov consulted Lenin, and after explaining the facts, said, "We await your decision." Lenin raised his head in surprise and asked, "Why my decision? Am I the Central Control Commission? The congress elected you and your comrades. Please make the decision." Krivov said, "Vladimir Ilyich, what is your opinion?" Lenin said, "That's another matter. I can talk about my own opinion. I think it was done poorly. Please call a meeting, and you can regard my opinion as the opinion of a party member, no higher than the opinion of a party member. As for the method of punishment, I have no opinion. This is entirely the authority of the Control Commission."
    Busy meetings and work did not make Lenin relax his contact with the masses. He often went among the masses to live, talk, and speak with them. Workers and peasants from all over the country also frequently came to the Kremlin to discuss matters with him. Many factories in Moscow bore his footprints. Rumyantsev, an old worker at the Sanshan Textile Factory, recalled: "Lenin came casually, sat on the wood, and talked with the workers of the Sanshan Factory. He was so concerned, simple, kind, and close that he will always remain in my memory." On August 30, 1918, Lenin went to the Mikhelson Factory (now named the Ilyich Factory) to deliver a speech. Although he had received news in advance that counter-revolutionaries were going to assassinate him, he still went as scheduled and on time, and was finally seriously injured in the assassination after the speech. On May 1, 1920, a Saturday, Lenin and 400,000 workers in Moscow (almost all adults at the time) participated in voluntary labor together. Workers, staff, and Red Army soldiers were filling pits, leveling roads, clearing garbage, laying bricks, carrying wood, and repairing schools, kindergartens, hospitals, and houses everywhere. Lenin also carried wood on Red Square. Voluntary Saturdays were full of a conscious attitude towards labor and later developed into socialist competition in production.
    Paying attention to listening to the voices of the masses became Lenin's habit. He often personally read the letters from the people and immediately dealt with the requests in the letters. At the end of 1918, he received a letter of appeal from a female teacher, Ivanova. He ordered an investigation and demanded that the results be reported as soon as possible. He wrote: "If things are true, these gangsters should be openly driven out, and leaflets should be issued to the prefecture and county, because the residents must be accustomed to well-founded accusations, which are of great significance and will achieve important results." Lenin had a collecting habit, but what he collected was not antiques but notes with opinions submitted to him at various meetings. He once had his secretary classify and catalog a large pile of notes. Lenin also adopted the investigation method of undercover visits. In his writings, there was such a record: Once, instead of alarming the local "big officials" with dozens of telegrams in the identity of a "big official," he walked along the railway as an unknown person. He was an unknown person riding in a track inspection car, so he was able to hear the honest and true (rather than flattering and false) talks of the staff. This allowed him to discover many shortcomings and take effective measures. Lenin even continued to care about the thoughts and emotions of workers and peasants during his serious illness.
    When we read Lenin's books and read books about Lenin, we can't help but be amazed by Lenin's objectivity, correctness, and foresight. There is a reason for this. Lenin himself pointed out more than once that contact with the masses greatly helped him to correctly understand the situation and decide on policies. At the Eighth All-Russian Congress of Soviets, Lenin particularly pointed out the role of interacting with ordinary people, saying: "Yesterday I happily participated in the small private meeting of our non-party delegates—the peasants—and gained a great deal from their debate on the most troublesome issues of rural life." He meticulously recorded the opinions and requests of each speaker and assured the delegates that he would ask the relevant government departments to adopt and handle them.
    Lenin was great. His most touching character, his most prominent feature, as Gorky said, was "simplicity. Simple as truth." (Attached picture)

    列宁在莫斯科
    本报记者　李何
    到莫斯科的人都迫不及待地上红场去。在红场中心，在克里姆林宫墙前，立着庄严的列宁—斯大林陵墓。每天有成千累万的苏联劳动者和访问苏联的世界各国的人们来这里谒陵。当你经过红场，看到长蛇阵一样的谒陵的人群的时候，当你看到苏联人辛勤地攻读列宁的著作和重温列宁的朴素、谦虚、深入群众、实事求是的作风的时候，你就会感觉到列宁一直活在人们的心里。
    列宁在1918年3月11日同苏维埃政府一起从彼得堡迁到了莫斯科。到莫斯科后两个星期，列宁指示克里姆林宫管理员马尔科夫，在苏维埃政权的首脑部——全俄中央执行委员会和人民委员会的房顶升起红旗。按照列宁的意见，全国时间的标准——克里姆林宫的自鸣钟修理好了。人们在清晨时钟敲打六下以后，和深夜时钟敲打十二下以后，听到的是激昂雄壮的国际歌而不是革命前的帝俄国歌了。直到苏联卫国战争后期，自鸣钟里才以苏联国歌更换了国际歌。
    列宁在莫斯科度过一生的最后几年。在莫斯科，有许多列宁到过的地方，有许多列宁留下的事迹。斯维尔德洛夫广场旁边的共青团剧院，是列宁在共青团第三次代表大会上演说的地方。列宁在这里发出了“学习，学习，再学习”的著名号召。学习再学习这个永戒骄傲、不断前进的精神，今天仍然鼓舞着全世界共产主义者。
    在莫斯科，和在彼得堡一样，担任人民委员长的列宁工作非常多，但他总是做得精确、周密。他不管睡得多么晏，每天上午十点一定开始工作，通常在这个时候和全俄中央执行委员会主席斯维尔德洛夫见面，商量事情。他一直工作到下午四、五点钟才休息。下午七点又工作到深夜二、三点。列宁的老朋友克尔日札诺夫斯基回忆说：列宁的脑子从来没有休息过。最后几年，他受了失眠的折磨。在入睡之前散步几小时，还是睡不着。别人提醒他不要过累了，他说：“难道我们的事业不值得这样干么？”
    列宁的住处和办公室都在克里姆林宫里。这里和他住过的列宁格勒的斯莫尔尼宫一样简朴，除了装满书籍的书架以外没有什么摆设。当时人民委员会全部只有六个房间，其中一间是列宁的办公室。他不让在这些房间挂他的肖像。他的住处和人民委员会的房间毗邻，是四个简单的小房间，住了他和他的夫人和一位妹妹。在他的写字桌的左边放着三架电话机。他常用电话工作。据老党员斯塔索娃回忆，列宁很少收发公文。他要求人家和自己不舞弄公文，尽量用电话直接处理问题。有一回，在深夜散步的时候，他注意到了有些住房的灯熄得很晚。他叫管理员在晚间检查一下，把他们的灯灭了。他说：“我们要说服他们不要浪费电力。我们应当节约每一公斤燃料，而他们却灯光照耀，要制止这种不像样的事。”
    十月革命后，粮食供给很困难。列宁在斯莫尔尼宫时常常自己拿着饭盒到食堂盛汤盛粥。在克里姆林宫，列宁吃的还是麦粥。红军打下产粮食的罗斯托夫以后，指挥员布琼尼到了莫斯科，带来了红军战士们送给列宁的许多食物——面粉、罐头、糖等等，亲手交给列宁。列宁谢谢他，第二天把全部礼物转送保育院的儿童们，自己还是吃麦粥。1919年8月22日，莫斯科苏维埃的食品部从国营农场送来一些水果给列宁，列宁第二天回信说：“我恳求以后不要这样做，水果等等不要送。请把如下的材料通知我：从国营农场送来的水果等等，一般是怎样分配的，分不分给医院、疗养院、儿童，分那几处，分多少？”列宁只愿领取普通工人的口粮。
    列宁非常关心同志。当时干部吃苦精神也是令人感动的。身为粮食人民委员的秋留普，有两次在会议上因为饥饿和劳累而昏倒了。列宁起初写信温和地劝他疗养三个星期。当劝说无效时，列宁只好下命令说：“由于秋留普不爱惜国家财产（两次昏倒），给他第一次警告，令他立刻回家去”。
    列宁的谦虚是始终如一的。还在“彼得堡斗争协会”时期，有一回要印发传单，列宁和克尔日扎诺夫斯基各准备一个草稿。列宁请克尔日扎诺夫斯基先读。听后，列宁说：“你的草稿更好，用得。你的稿子有真正的鼓动力。”当过苏共中央监察委员的克里沃夫回忆说：有一次，莫斯科组织的重要工作人员泄露了未经公布的政府决定。克里沃夫找列宁商量，把事实经过谈完以后说：“我们等候您的决定”。列宁惊奇地抬起头来问：“为什么我的决定？难道我是中央监察委员会？代表大会选举了您和您一道的同志们。请您们决定吧。”克里沃夫说：“弗拉基米尔·伊里奇，您的意见怎样？”列宁说：“这是另外一回事。我可以谈自己的意见。我认为，干得不像样。请您召开会议，可以把我这个意见当作一个党员的意见，不高于一个党员的意见。至于处分的办法，我没有意见。这完完全全是监察委员会的职权。”
    繁忙的会议和工作，没有使列宁放松和群众的接触。他经常到群众中去，一起生活，谈话，演说。全国各地工人和农民也经常来克里姆林宫找他商量事情。莫斯科许多工厂有他的足迹。三山纺织厂老工人鲁米扬采夫回忆说：“列宁随随便便来了，坐在木头上，和三山厂工人谈话，那么关心、朴素、慈蔼、亲近，使他永远留在我的记忆里。”1918年8月30日，列宁到了米赫里逊工厂（现名伊里奇工厂）演说。虽然事先已经得到反革命分子要行刺的消息，他还是如约按时去了，终于在演说后被刺受了重伤。1920年5月1日，星期六，列宁和莫斯科的四十万劳动者（当时的几乎全部成年人）一起参加了义务劳动。工人、职员、红军战士，在各处填坑平路，清除垃圾，砌砖抬木，修理学校、幼儿园、医院、房屋，列宁也在红场上抬木料。义务星期六充满着自觉的劳动态度，后来发展成为生产中的社会主义竞赛。
    留心倾听群众的声音，成为列宁的生活习惯。他常常亲自阅读人民的来信，立即处理来信中的要求。1918年底，他收到了女教员伊凡诺娃的一封申诉书，他命令进行调查，要求尽快把结果报告。他写道：“如果事情是真实的，应当公开地赶走这些黑帮分子，应当向府、县发布传单，因为必须使居民习惯于有根据的控诉，这种控诉具有重要的意义，并且会取得重要的结果”。列宁有一种收集癖，但他收的不是古董而是在各种会议上人们提交他的意见字条。他曾经把大堆字条给秘书分类编目。列宁也采用微行察访的调查方法。在他的著作中有过这样的记载：有一次，他不以几十封专电惊动地方的“大官”身份，而以无人晓得的人物的身份，沿着铁路走，他是乘验道车的无名氏，所以能够听到职员们坦白的、真实的（而不是谄媚和虚伪的）谈吐。这使他发现了许多缺点，采取了有效的措施。列宁甚至在重病时期还不断地关心工人、农民的思想和情绪。
    我们读列宁的书，看关于列宁的书的时候，都不禁惊奇列宁的客观、正确和远见。此中是有道理的。列宁自己不只一次指出，联系群众大大帮助他正确地了解情况和决定政策。在全俄苏维埃第八次代表大会上，列宁特别指出了和普通人来往的作用，他说：“我昨天快活地参加我们的代表大会的非党代表们——农民的不大的私人的会议，并且从他们关于农村生活的最头痛的问题的辩论中得到非常多的东西。”他详细地记录了每个发言者的意见和要求，并且向代表们保证将关照有关的政府部门采纳办理。
    列宁是伟大的。他最感人的性格，他最突出的特点，正如高尔基所说的，是“朴素。真理一样朴素。”（附图片）
