Xinhua News Agency, April 3rd, London Dispatch: British Prime Minister Macmillan reiterated in the House of Commons on the 2nd that he would insist on conducting hydrogen bomb tests. He said that conducting such tests was supported by the leader of the opposition party.

He also mentioned that Britain intends to submit certain proposals regarding the hydrogen bomb test issue to the Disarmament Subcommittee that is currently meeting. However, when the opposition leader Gaitskell pressed him on what these proposals were, Macmillan refused to elaborate, citing confidentiality.

On the same day, Macmillan also stated in a written response that he hoped to issue a statement soon regarding future trade with China.

Xinhua News Agency, London, April 3rd: The South Wales Miners' Union decided on April 2nd to demand that the government cancel hydrogen bomb tests and immediately discuss with other major powers to reach an agreement banning all tests as the first step towards disarmament.

The British Council of Churches, at its meeting in London on the 2nd, also passed a resolution criticizing the government's decision to insist on conducting hydrogen bomb tests. The resolution called on the British, American, and Soviet governments to reach a general agreement on the control of nuclear weapons as soon as possible.

The chairwoman of the Labour Party Women's Movement, Alice Wood, demanded at the Labour Party Women's National Conference that the government make "sincere and firm efforts" to reach an agreement to stop nuclear explosions.
