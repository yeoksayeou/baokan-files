Respectfully Presented to Mr. Asanuma Inejirō, Head of the Goodwill Delegation of the Japanese Socialist Party Visiting China
Chen Mingshu

Poem 1
Same script, same race, hearts entwined,
People of two nations, friendship refined.
Around the grand banquet, goodwill emissaries reside,
Joy overflowing, emotions cannot hide.

Poem 2
Eloquent words resound, vibrant and bright,
Righteous pronouncements, weighty and upright.
Restoring diplomatic ties hinges upon:
No division, Taiwan must belong. Note 1

Poem 3
Suggesting an "Eastern Locarno,"
A grand plan for security, believed with such might.
Pitiable those who merely follow,
One can imagine your sighs, day and night. Note 2

Poem 4
China and the Soviet Union first unite economically,
Setting an example for Sino-Japanese harmony.
Laughable are today's shortsighted,
How can they know the ocean's tranquility. Note 3

Poem 5
"Panchsheel" sung throughout Asia's east,
Following it, together we move towards the Great Harmony.
May we strive together with you,
Global liberation achieves complete victory.

Note 1: Referring to Mr. Asanuma's proposition in his speech at the New Qiao Hotel auditorium on the 16th.
Note 2: Referring to the Japanese Socialist Party's similar proposal for an Eastern collective security treaty akin to the Locarno Treaties in Europe, which was opposed by its government.
Note 3: Refuting the arguments made by the spokesperson of the current Japanese government.

    敬赠日本社会党访华亲善使节团团长浅沼稻次郎先生七绝五首
    陈铭枢
    其一
    同文同种要同心，
    两国人民交日深，
    围绕盛筵亲善使，
    大家欢乐意难禁。
    其二
    嘉音台焕似斑斓，
    义正词严岂等闲，
    恢复邦交先决在：
    不容分裂看台湾。注一
    其三
    建议“东方洛加诺”，
    安全大计信如斯，
    可怜俯仰随人者，
    想见先生太息时。注二
    其四
    中苏经济先联结，
    正为日中示一般，
    可笑而今短视者，
    焉知大海有安澜。注三
    其五
    “潘查希拉”唱亚东，
    遵此携将进大同，
    愿与先生齐努力，
    全球解放始全功。
    注一：指先生十六日在新侨饭店礼堂演讲的主张。
    注二：指日本社会党对东方集体安全有过类似欧洲洛加诺协约的主张，为其政府所反对。
    注三：驳目前日本政府方面发言人的议论。
