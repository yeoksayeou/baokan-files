Xinhua News Agency, Amman, April 14th: The Jordanian people held demonstrations in Amman on the 13th, angrily condemning imperialist conspiracies and calling for the preservation of Jordan's independence.

Demonstrators held up signs with slogans such as "Army and People Unite," "Down with the Eisenhower Doctrine," and "Down with All Imperialists." Demonstrators also specifically chanted slogans attacking US President Special Envoy Richards, who is promoting the "Eisenhower Doctrine" in Middle Eastern countries.

The demonstrators listened to enthusiastic speeches by several public leaders, who called for maintaining Arab unity and demanded that a new government be formed by the party with a majority in parliament.

Shukair, a prominent figure in the National Front, pointed out in his speech that the Jordanian political crisis caused by Nabulsi's dismissal was instigated by the Americans.

Xinhua News Agency, Amman, April 14th: The cabinet crisis in Jordan has entered its fifth day. National Socialist Nimer's second attempt to form a cabinet on the evening of the 13th failed again after the cabinet list was rejected by King Hussein. Hussein has now once again appointed Senate Speaker Mufti to form a cabinet.

According to reports, six members of the dismissed Nabulsi cabinet are on the new cabinet list proposed by Nimer. In addition to the National Socialist Party, the Arab Ba'ath Party, and the National Front, which participated in the Nabulsi cabinet, the list also includes the Arab Constitutional Party and independent figures.

The united front of parties participating in the proposed new cabinet issued a statement declaring that the new government should follow the policies of the liberated Arab national front together with Egypt and Syria, strive to establish a federation of Jordan, Egypt, and Syria, and thwart imperialist attempts to drag Jordan into foreign treaties or the Eisenhower Doctrine. The statement also advocated respecting the letter and spirit of the constitution and excluding pro-imperialist elements from the government.
