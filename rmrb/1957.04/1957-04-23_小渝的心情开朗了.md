    Xiao Yu's Spirits Lifted
    Dai Yue
    Wu Xiaoyu, a junior middle school student in the 56th Middle School of Beijing, has parents who both received higher education. Her father, Wu Tingjun, is a professor at the Beijing Railway Institute, and her mother is currently a homemaker. Old Professor Wu Tingjun grew up in the rural areas of Hunan, where his family made a living by farming. He developed good labor habits from a young age, and he always worked part-time while attending middle school and university. Even now, in his spare time, he does some physical labor, often tilling the open space in front of his door to plant various plants. The old professor uses his actions to educate his children to love labor and respect labor.
    Speaking of Xiao Yu's further education, Professor Wu Tingjun said, "If Xiao Yu doesn't get into high school, we will have her study on her own while participating in labor, to train her into a complete person, with both book knowledge and practical experience, so that she can avoid the pain of lacking production knowledge like some intellectuals do now." Xiao Yu's mother said: In the past, she only thought about sending her child to university and never thought about the possibility of not getting in. After reading the People's Daily editorial "On the Issue of Middle and Primary School Graduates Participating in Agricultural Production," she realized that it is impossible for all middle school graduates to go to university. Students going to university is one way out, and participating in production is also a way out. In the old society, laborers were discriminated against, but in the new society, all kinds of labor are respected. Xiao Yu's mother also stated at a parents' meeting held at the school: "If Xiao Yu doesn't get into high school, we will definitely help her find a way out."
    Xiao Yu, however, had many concerns. She once thought: After graduating from junior middle school, if her classmates get into high school but she doesn't, it would be too embarrassing. What would she do then? Staying at home, even if her mom and dad don't blame her, she wouldn't be able to face people. What made her particularly anxious was that her younger sister, who is two years younger than her but in the same grade at the No. 1 Girls' Middle School, is very active and does well in her studies. She is very likely to get into high school. If she falls behind her sister, she would really have nowhere to put her face. Thinking of this, she felt unspeakably sad. After that, she studied even harder, even skipping some school activities and cramming day and night. But this tension caused her academic performance to decline. Her mother noticed this abnormal phenomenon, learned about Xiao Yu's inner thoughts in detail, and patiently persuaded and comforted her, repeatedly telling her: "If your sister gets in but you don't, the family will never discriminate against you, and we will definitely help you learn some knowledge that you can't get from books." The mother now, on the one hand, urges Xiao Yu to adhere to a schedule and study hard; on the other hand, she helps her develop a plan for labor and self-study at home if she doesn't get in, which stipulates that in addition to seriously reviewing lessons and practicing drawing, there are also physical labor activities such as sewing, washing, cooking, and doing chores.
    With the help of her parents, Xiao Yu's spirits have lifted. She said, "It doesn't matter what job I do if I don't get into high school."

    小渝的心情开朗了
    戴月
    北京市五十六中初中三年级学生伍小渝的父亲和母亲都受过高等教育。她父亲伍廷钧是北京铁道学院的教授，母亲现在从事家务劳动。老教授伍廷钧生长在湖南农村，家里种地为生。他从小就养成了良好的劳动习惯，念中学、念大学一直是半工半读。现在他在业余时间也作些体力劳动，常把门前的空地刨起来种上各种植物。老教授用自己的行动教育孩子热爱劳动、尊重劳动。
    提起小渝升学的事，伍廷钧教授说：“假如小渝考不上高中，就叫她一面自学一面参加劳动，把她锻炼成一个完全的人，既有书本知识也有实际经验，可以避免像现在一些知识分子那样没有生产知识的痛苦。”小渝的母亲说：以前只想供孩子上大学，根本没想到升不了学的事情。看了人民日报“关于中小学毕业生参加农业生产问题”的社论以后，才认识到中学毕业生都要升大学是不可能的。学生升学是条出路，参加生产也是出路。旧社会劳动人民是受人歧视的，新社会各种劳动都是受人尊敬的。小渝的母亲还在学校召开的家长会议上表示：“小渝要是升不了学，一定帮助她找到出路。”
    小渝的顾虑却很多。她曾经想：初中毕业后，要是同学们考上了高中而自己考不上，可太丢人了。那时候怎么办？呆在家里，妈妈爸爸虽然不责备，自己面子可下不去。使她特别着急的是，她妹妹在女一中读书，比她小两岁，却和她同年级。妹妹很活跃，功课也好，很可能考上高中，要是自己落在妹妹后边，脸可实在没处搁。一想到这里，她心里有说不出来的难过。以后，她就更加用功学习，甚至学校里的一些活动她都不参加，黑天白日地啃书本子。可是她这样紧张，学习的成绩反而下降。母亲发现了她这种不正常的现象，详细地了解了小渝的心里活动，并且耐心地说服她、安慰她，反复告诉她：“假如妹妹考取，你考不取，家里决不歧视你，一定帮助你学一些书本上所没有的知识。”母亲现在一方面督促小渝遵守作息时间，好好学习功课；另方面帮助她拟订考不取时在家劳动和自学的计划，计划里规定除了认真复习功课、练习绘画以外，还有缝纫、浆洗、做菜、做饭等体力劳动。
    小渝在她爸爸、妈妈的帮助下，心情开朗了。她说：“要是考不上高中，干什么工作都可以”。
