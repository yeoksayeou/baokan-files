    Though the Enemy is Diminished, We Must Not Become Complacent
    Beijing Arrests Kuomintang Spy Wang Kejing

    (Our Dispatch) Recently, the Beijing Public Security Bureau lawfully arrested Kuomintang spy Wang Kejing.

    Wang Kejing received training at the 19th class of the puppet Central Military Academy, and served as a platoon leader and company commander. In 1948, he participated in the "Anti-Espionage Security Group" of the puppet 53rd Army. After the liberation of the Northeast, he falsified his history and infiltrated the Shenyang Smelting Plant, but was later discovered and purged. In 1950, after the outbreak of the Korean War, he fled to Hong Kong. In 1952, he took refuge in Chiang Kai-shek's spy agency, the "Second Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense," and was transferred to the "Outlying Personnel Training Class" in Taipei, Taiwan, for spy training. Later, he was appointed as "Independent Station Chief," awaiting orders to sneak into the mainland.

    In the spring of 1954, Wang Kejing was sent to Northeast China to engage in intelligence activities, but his attempt to sneak across the border was thwarted, and he returned to Hong Kong to continue his spy training. After graduation, he was appointed as a "Specialist of the Second Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense," specializing in collecting military intelligence from the Beijing and Tianjin areas.

    This January, Wang Kejing received 3,500 Hong Kong dollars in spy funds and sneaked into the mainland with spy equipment, arriving in Beijing on January 23. However, he was soon reported by the masses. After a thorough investigation by the Beijing Public Security Bureau, conclusive evidence was obtained, and Wang was lawfully arrested, and all the evidence of his crimes was seized. The Public Security Bureau is currently interrogating him.

    王克兢曾在伪中央军校第十九期受训，当过排长、连长等职，1948年参加了伪五十三军的“防谍保密小组”。东北解放后，他伪造历史混入沈阳冶炼厂，后被查出清洗。1950年朝鲜战争爆发后逃往香港。1952年投靠了蒋介石特务机关“国防部二厅”，并调往台湾台北市“外勤人员训练班”受特务训练。以后被任命为“独立台台长”，待命潜入大陆。
    1954年春，王克兢被派至我国东北地区从事情报活动，但在偷渡途中遇阻未遂，又返回香港，继续受特务训练。结业后被任命为“国防部二厅专员”，专门搜集北京、天津地区的军事情报。
    今年1月王克兢领到三千五百元（港币）的特务经费，携带特务工具潜入大陆，1月23日到达北京。但不久即为群众检举，经北京市公安机关的严密侦察，取得确凿罪证，已将王犯依法逮捕，并查出全部罪证。目前公安机关正在审讯中。
