Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, April 8th. Tea connoisseurs will soon be able to taste the flavor of "Mingqian" Biluochun tea, which they haven't tasted for three years.

Biluochun tea is a famous specialty of the Dongting Mountains in Taihu Lake. Biluochun tea, picked and produced before the Qingming Festival, is even more precious. Its characteristics are its delicacy and the excellent combination of color and taste. When steeped in a cup, it is green and clear, every leaf sinks to the bottom, and it emits a refreshing fragrance.

The labor and materials required to pick and produce "Mingqian" Biluochun tea are significant, and it hasn't been produced for three years. This year, the relevant departments of Zhenze County raised the price of tea, led tea farmers to strengthen tea garden management, and comprehensively increased the application of spring fertilizer based on the application of winter fertilizer last year. Therefore, this year, the tea trees have sprouted early, grown evenly, and developed vigorously. This year, the Dongting Mountains will produce 250 dan of Biluochun tea.

    “明前”碧螺春茶恢复生产
    新华社南京8日电　考究品茶的人们最近可以尝到三年没有尝过的“明前”碧螺春茶叶的滋味了。
    碧螺春茶叶是太湖洞庭山的著名特产。清明前采制的碧螺春更是名贵。它的特点是纤嫩、色味并佳。泡在杯里，上下碧绿，根根沉底，一片清香。
    采制“明前”碧螺春茶叶工本很大，已经有三年没有采制。今年震泽县有关方面提高茶叶价格，领导茶农加强茶园管理工作，并在去年施冬肥的基础上全面增施了一次春肥。所以今年茶树发芽早、长得齐、发棵茂盛。今年洞庭山将采制碧螺春茶叶二百五十担。
