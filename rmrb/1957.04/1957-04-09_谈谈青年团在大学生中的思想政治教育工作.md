The Chinese Communist Party has always attached great importance to conducting Marxist-Leninist education among young students. Attaching importance to both the mastery of cultural and scientific knowledge and the cultivation of ideological awareness and moral character is one of the characteristics of socialist schools. Under the education of this comprehensive development policy and inspired by the great achievements of the motherland's construction, university students in our country have obtained unprecedentedly good conditions for growth, and their thinking has made great progress: generally, they have determined the socialist political direction and are willing to contribute their strength to building a great socialist country; they love the Communist Party and support the Party's policies; their enthusiasm and consciousness for learning are high, and a diligent style of study and good moral customs are constantly forming. This is a very gratifying phenomenon. However, at present, most of the university students come from families of the exploiting classes and small producers. Coupled with the limitations of age, experience, and knowledge, although they generally want to take the socialist road, they are also easily influenced by bourgeois ideology. To cultivate them into communist intellectuals will inevitably require long-term education and transformation. Last year was a year of drastic developments and changes in the domestic and international situation. During this period, many students exposed many vague understandings and erroneous thoughts in terms of their positions, viewpoints, the relationship between the individual and the collective, and their views on certain Party policies and the socialist system. This situation shows us that strengthening Marxist-Leninist ideological education for students is a constant task that cannot be relaxed at any time.

    **Clarify the Purpose of Ideological and Political Education**

    University students will be socialist construction cadres in the future; this requires them to have a high degree of socialist ideological consciousness. Cultivating and improving students' socialist ideological consciousness is the purpose of ideological and political education. Socialist ideological consciousness includes two interrelated aspects: a communist outlook on life and a dialectical-materialist way of thinking. The question of outlook on life is the primary issue in the self-transformation of intellectuals and in cultivating young students to become socialist construction cadres. Judging from the ideological problems frequently exposed by some students, such as failing to view problems from the proletarian standpoint, neglecting political study, unilaterally emphasizing personal interests, pursuing material enjoyment, fearing hardship and avoiding difficulties, and not obeying state allocation, it can be said that all of these are related to the fact that a communist outlook on life has not been established, or that the communist outlook on life is not yet consolidated. Therefore, when conducting ideological and political education for students, it is natural to determine the specific educational content according to the specific situation. However, no matter what kind of education is conducted, it should help cultivate and establish a communist outlook on life. Having an outlook on life education alone is not complete; ideological methodology education should also be carried out. This is especially important for young students whose thinking is most easily subjective and one-sided. The reason why students often have some vague understandings and erroneous thoughts is that some are indeed issues of class stand, and some are indeed issues of understanding. Due to the subjective and one-sided nature of their way of thinking, they often easily view problems in a fragmented way, taking phenomena as essence, part as the whole, accident as necessity, and feelings as policy; in the face of complex things, they feel confused, unable to distinguish east from west, and thus unconsciously fail to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, and even lose their stand. Arming students with a dialectical-materialist way of thinking can liberate them from the shackles of old ideas, improve their ability to understand and analyze things, and prevent them from losing their way in any chaotic situation, enabling them to clearly distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, right and wrong, thereby promoting a firmer proletarian stand.

    Cultivating students' communist outlook on life and dialectical-materialist way of thinking is a general direction and a long-term task, which cannot be achieved merely by listening to one or two reports or reading a few books. The educational content must be determined at any time according to the development of the situation and the students' ideological state. Judging from the current situation, we should focus on strengthening class education, inheriting revolutionary tradition education, collectivism, and education on obeying state allocation. Is conducting these educations "old hat"? It should be known that students' problems are constantly being solved and are constantly occurring; their mobility is very high, and the education that has been repeatedly conducted in the past may not necessarily have been understood by all the students currently in school. Truth is not afraid of being repeated thousands of times. As long as we are good at combining theory with practice and adapting to local conditions, these educational contents will always show the vitality of youth.

    **Carry out various mass activities**

    Ideological and political education is a regular and lasting work, and also a mass self-education and self-transformation work. On the one hand, it should try to go through certain classroom teaching and rely on the strength of teachers; on the other hand, it must also carry out many mass activities with educational significance, according to the principle of combining top-down and bottom-up, and combining in-class and extracurricular activities, otherwise, it will become empty talk. Based on past experience, we feel that special attention should always be paid to the following activities.

    First, strengthen current affairs and policy education. Current affairs and policy education is a lively and vivid Marxist-Leninist education. Through the study of current affairs and policies, students can broaden their political horizons, cultivate the proletarian stand and viewpoint, improve their ability to analyze and criticize things, promote the firmness of their outlook on life, and strengthen the connection between students and the Party in terms of thought and feeling. Therefore, current affairs and policy education is an important position for ideological and political education. In addition to requiring students to develop the habit of reading newspapers every day, we should combine major domestic and international political events and the Party's major policies and principles, and regularly (for example, once every two weeks) give reports to students, and with leadership organize seminars and discussions to allow various opinions and arguments to be freely expressed, and then summarize them. Only in this way can confused thoughts be clarified, errors be corrected, and the truth be recognized. Since the beginning of this semester, many schools have concentrated on conducting a current affairs education centered on studying the People's Daily article "On the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" under the direct leadership of the Party committee, which has achieved good results. At present, many students have some confused thoughts and erroneous understandings on the issue of agricultural cooperation, the issue of building the country through diligence and thrift, and some issues in industrial and agricultural construction. We can also appropriately imitate the above-mentioned method to strengthen education.

    Second, help students to study political theory courses well. Political theory courses are disciplines that systematically explain the principles and principles of Marxism-Leninism, which is of great significance to students in forming a communist outlook on life and cultivating a dialectical-materialist way of thinking. At present, the problems in the teaching of political theory courses are: first, some students mistakenly put politics and majors in opposition, thinking that "politics is empty theory, and business is real ability," neglecting political theory courses and not studying hard; second, the quality of teaching is not high, it is divorced from reality, and it is not combined enough with students' thinking. In response to this situation, the Communist Youth League organizations can carry out three aspects of work: first, regularly educate students to correctly understand the relationship between politics and majors, understand the significance of studying political theory courses well, to improve the awareness of learning; second, establish regular contact with the Marxism-Leninism teaching and research group, reflect students' ideological conditions and opinions on teaching. In this sense, assist teachers to improve teaching methods and improve teaching quality; third, organize auxiliary extracurricular activities in conjunction with the course content to deepen and consolidate classroom knowledge, and urge students to connect theory and practice.

    Third, organize students to participate in appropriate social activities. A graduate student from a university has been in school for sixteen or seventeen years since elementary school. Their entire childhood and most of their youth have been spent in school. This can easily bring about shortcomings such as being out of touch with reality, lack of knowledge, empty life, and narrow thinking; therefore, they lack a deep feeling for workers and peasants, and cannot truly establish the idea of "combining with workers and peasants and serving workers and peasants." This certainly requires attention to the improvement of the education system and teaching methods on the one hand, and on the other hand, we must use the method of organizing students to participate in appropriate social activities to make up for this deficiency. The scope of social activities is very broad, and various places have many experiences in organizing such activities. Among them, a form that is particularly worth mentioning is the activity of organizing students to strengthen contact with workers and peasants and provide voluntary assistance. This activity can take the class as a unit, establish more regular contact with industrial and mining enterprises or agricultural cooperatives near the school, combine with the students' majors, appropriately help workers or peasants learn relevant industrial and agricultural scientific and technological knowledge, carry out cultural and artistic activities, and when necessary, should also help rural areas carry out physical labor such as drought prevention, rush planting, flood prevention, and harvesting; they can hold gatherings and heart-to-heart talks with workers and peasants on weekends and holidays; they can invite advanced producers to report to students on practical production knowledge and advanced deeds; during winter and summer vacations, they can also organize larger-scale visits to factories, mines, rural areas, and construction sites, as well as social surveys. Through these activities, students can get in touch with actual production struggles as early as possible and increase some perceptual knowledge; cultivate feelings of love for labor and respect for working people; exercise the quality of serving public undertakings, thereby helping to improve socialist ideological consciousness.

    This activity was widely organized in various schools across the country before 1955. Although some places had shortcomings such as frequent activities and forced uniformity during this period, in general, it achieved great results and was welcomed by the majority of students. Therefore, as long as we pay attention to abiding by the principle of voluntariness and do not hinder study and health in the future, we should continue to widely and persistently carry it out.

    Fourth, pay close attention to the organizational life of the Communist Youth League. At present, the members of the Communist Youth League in universities generally account for more than 60% of all students. The members of the Communist Youth League are the advanced part of the students. We must rely on the advanced to help and lead the backward, so educating the members of the Communist Youth League well is an important link in educating all students well. In addition to requiring them to receive education together with all students, the members of the Communist Youth League should also be given stricter education by using the organizational life of the Communist Youth League. The organizational life of the Communist Youth League is a school for members to study Marxism-Leninism, train revolutionary organizational discipline, and cultivate communist moral character. In the past, the organizational life of the Communist Youth League in some schools had shortcomings such as not being strict enough, having empty content, and being too focused on being relaxed and happy, so the education and help for the members were not great. In the future, it should be more strict, and the phenomenon of not participating in organizational life for a long time must be eliminated; the content should be rich and substantial. All major domestic and international political events, important policies and laws of the Party and the government, important issues in academic culture, the ideological trends and opinions and requirements of the masses in a period, should be used as topics for organizational life to be studied, discussed, and researched. The Communist Youth League organization should require members to play a exemplary role in terms of class stand, ideological style, and moral character; it is necessary to use the organizational life of the Communist Youth League to carry out criticism and self-criticism, help members overcome shortcomings and errors, and truly become the core of uniting and educating the vast number of young people.

    **Adhere to the Method of Combining Theory with Practice and Persuasive Education**

    Adhering to the method of combining theory with practice and persuasive education, and overcoming the shortcomings of dogmatism and crude simplicity, are important conditions for doing a good job in ideological and political education. The so-called combining theory with practice is to unify reasoning and organizing practice, understand some basic principles through reading, giving reports, and holding discussion meetings, and at the same time create appropriate conditions to organize some practical activities to reflect and consolidate these principles. Repeat this continuously and gradually deepen it. When giving reports and holding discussion meetings, it is necessary to understand the ideological state of the masses, find out where the root cause of the problem lies, and then prescribe the right medicine to achieve practical results. In the past, some comrades regarded the problem of educating young people as too simple, thinking that it was enough to talk about some empty big principles and put forward this or that requirement. The result was naturally not good.

    We must vigorously strengthen the education of Marxism-Leninism, but we must never force people to accept it. We must use the method of inspiring consciousness and persuading people with reason to make young people bow their heads sincerely in front of the truth. At present, some students still have various opinions and views on issues such as the socialist system, the leadership of the Party, the life of peasants, and culture and art. We should let go and organize them to carry out democratic discussions. We are never afraid to conceal contradictions, and we must consciously guide them to express all kinds of opinions without reservation. For all kinds of wrong ideas, do not use crude and simple methods to fight back, but calmly reason and rely on reason to persuade people to consciously correct their mistakes and accept the truth. Truth is developed in the struggle with error, so it will become clearer and clearer and produce irresistible persuasiveness. For students who have made mistakes in general, we must still adhere to persuasive education. We can criticize them realistically, but do not rudely reprimand them, let alone casually struggle and punish them. The lessons of the past few years tell us that dogmatic and simple and crude educational methods not only cannot achieve the effect of education, but also will cause young people to swallow articles whole without independent thinking, their self-esteem and enthusiasm will be frustrated, and even cause individual students to have hostile emotions towards the Party.

    Finally, when talking about what educational methods we adopt, we must see that the young students of our country have always grown up under the nurture of the Chinese Communist Party, are full of revolutionary spirit, and the vast majority sincerely accept the leadership of the Party. Some of their erroneous thoughts are not difficult to educate. We must grasp firmly in these important issues of position, viewpoint, ideology, and moral character, but we should cherish and support their legitimate enthusiasm; while strengthening ideological and political education, we must conscientiously expand democratic life and care about their legitimate requirements in teaching and life. Combining letting go and leadership, combining respect and trust with strengthening education, this is the attitude we should take towards young students.

    谈谈青年团在大学生中的思想政治教育工作
    曾德林
    中国共产党一直就是十分注意向青年学生进行马克思列宁主义教育的。既重视文化科学知识的造诣，又重视思想意识和道德品质的培养，这是社会主义学校的特点之一。在这种全面发展的方针的教育下和祖国建设的伟大成就的鼓舞下，我国高等学校的学生获得了空前良好的成长条件，思想有了很大的进步：一般都确定了社会主义的政治方向，愿意为建设一个伟大的社会主义国家贡献自己的力量；热爱共产党和拥护党的政策；学习的积极性和自觉性高涨，刻苦钻研的学风和良好的道德风尚正在不断形成。这是十分可喜的现象。但是目前高等学校的学生大部分还是出身于剥削阶级和小生产者的家庭，加上年龄、经验和知识的限制，所以他们一般虽然愿意走社会主义的道路，同时也容易接受资产阶级的思想影响，要把他们培养成为共产主义的知识分子，必定要经过长期的教育和改造。去年这一年是国内外形势发展变化很剧烈的一年，许多学生在这当中在立场观点、个人和集体的关系、对党的某些政策和社会主义制度的看法等上面，都暴露了不少的模糊认识和错误思想。这种情况向我们表明：对学生加强马克思列宁主义的思想教育，是一个时刻不容松懈的经常任务。
    明确思想政治教育的目的性
    高等学校的学生，将来是社会主义的建设干部；这就必须具有高度的社会主义思想觉悟。培养和提高学生的社会主义思想觉悟，就是思想政治教育的目的。社会主义思想觉悟，包括互相联系的两个方面，就是共产主义的人生观和辩证唯物主义的思想方法。人生观问题，是知识分子自我改造也是培养青年学生成为社会主义建设干部的首要问题。从一些学生经常暴露出来的思想问题来看，诸如不从无产阶级的立场看问题，轻视政治学习，片面强调个人利益，追求生活享受，惧怕艰苦和躲避困难，不服从国家分配，等等，可以说都是和没有建立共产主义人生观，或者共产主义人生观还不巩固这个事实相联系的。所以在向学生进行思想政治教育的时候，自然要根据具体情况决定这种或那种教育内容，但是不管进行哪种教育，都应当有助于培养和建立共产主义的人生观。光有人生观的教育还不完全，还应该进行思想方法的教育，这对思想方法最容易主观片面的青年学生来说，尤其显得重要。学生当中之所以经常会产生一些模糊认识和错误思想，有的固然是阶级立场问题，有的也的确是认识问题。由于思想方法的主观和片面，他们常常容易支离破碎地看待问题，把现象当本质，局部当全体，视偶然为必然，以感想代政策；在复杂的事物面前感到扑朔迷离，莫辨东西，因而会不自觉地敌我不分，乃至丧失立场。用辩证唯物主义的思想来武装学生，可以使他们从旧的思想桎梏中解放出来，提高认识事物和分析事物的能力，在任何混沌的情形下也不致迷失方向，能够明辨敌我是非，从而促进无产阶级的立场更加坚定。
    培养学生共产主义的人生观和辩证唯物主义的思想方法是一个总的方向，也是一个长期的任务，绝非仅仅听一两次报告或者读几本书就能达到目的的。必须随着形势的发展，根据学生的思想状况随时确定教育内容。就目前情况来看，应当着重加强阶级教育、继承革命传统教育、集体主义和服从国家分配的教育。进行这些教育是不是“老一套”呢？要知道，学生当中的问题是不断解决又在不断发生的；他们的流动性很大，过去虽已一再进行过的教育，不一定今天所有的在校学生都已经懂得了。真理是不怕千百次地重复的。只要善于结合实际，因时因地制宜，这些教育内容就会永远显示青春的生命力。
    开展各种群众性的活动
    思想政治教育是一个经常持久的工作，也是一个群众性的自我教育自我改造工作。它一方面要尽量通过某些课堂教学和依靠教师的力量；一方面还必须按照自上而下和自下而上相结合、课内和课外相结合的原则，开展许多富有教育意义的群众性的活动，否则就会流于空谈。根据过去的经验，我们觉得特别要经常重视下面的几个活动。
    第一、加强时事政策教育。时事政策教育是一种生动活泼的马克思列宁主义教育。通过时事政策的学习，可以使学生开阔政治眼界，培养无产阶级的立场、观点，提高分析和批判事物的能力，促进人生观的坚定，密切学生和党在思想感情上的联系，所以时事政策教育是思想政治教育的一个重要阵地。我们除了要求学生养成天天读报的习惯外，应当结合国内外的重大政治事件和党的重大方针政策，定期（比如两周一次）向学生作报告，并且要有领导地组织座谈和讨论，使各种意见和议论都能自由地表达出来，然后加以总结。这样才有可能澄清混乱思想，修正错误和认识真理。这学期开学以后，许多学校都在党委的直接领导下，集中地进行了一次以学习人民日报“再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”一文为中心的时事教育，收到了很好的效果。目前许多学生对农业合作化问题、勤俭建国问题和工农业建设当中的一些问题，都有一些混乱思想和错误认识，也可适当仿照上述办法加强教育。
    第二、帮助学生努力学好政治理论课。政治理论课是系统地阐明马克思列宁主义的原理原则的学科，对学生形成共产主义的人生观和培养辩证唯物主义的思想方法具有重要的意义。目前在政治理论课的教学上存在的问题，一是有些学生错误地把政治和专业对立起来，认为“政治是空道理，业务是真本领”，轻视政治理论课，不好好学习；二是教课上质量不高，脱离实际，结合学生思想不够。针对这种情况，青年团的组织可以进行三方面的工作：一是经常教育学生正确认识政治和专业的关系，懂得学好政治理论课的意义，以提高学习的自觉性；二是和马克思列宁主义教研组取得经常联系，反映学生的思想状况和对教学上的意见。在这个意义上协助教师改进教学方法，提高教学质量；三是结合课程内容组织辅助性的课外活动，以加深和巩固课堂知识，并且敦促学生理论和实践的联系。
    第三、组织学生适当参加社会活动。一个高等学校的毕业学生，从小学起，一直要过十六年或十七年的学习生活，他们的整个少年时期和绝大部分青年时期都是在学校中度过的。这就容易带来脱离实际、知识贫乏、生活空虚和思想狭窄的缺陷；也因此缺乏对工农劳动人民的深厚感情，不能真正建立起“与工农结合、为工农服务”的思想。这固然一方面要注意教育制度和教学方法的改进，一方面还必须用组织学生适当参加社会活动的办法来弥补这个缺陷。社会活动的范围很广泛，各地在组织这种活动中都有许多经验，其中特别值得提出的一种形式就是组织学生和工农加强联系、进行义务帮助的活动。这项活动可以以班级为单位，和学校附近的工矿企业或农业合作社取得较为经常的联系，结合学生所学的专业，适当帮助工人或农民学习有关的工农业科学技术知识，开展文化艺术活动，必要时还应当帮助农村进行防旱、抢种、防汛、收获等体力劳动；可以在周末和节日与工人农民举行联欢、谈心；可以邀请生产先进者给同学报告生产实际知识和先进事迹；在寒暑假还可组织较大规模的对厂矿、农村和工地的联欢访问活动和社会调查。通过这些活动，可以使学生及早接触实际生产斗争，增加一些感性知识；培养热爱劳动、尊敬劳动人民的感情；锻炼为公共事业服务的品质，从而有助于社会主义思想觉悟的提高。
    这项活动，在1955年以前全国各校都曾经广泛组织过，虽然其间有些地方发生过活动频繁和强求一律的缺点，但是总的是收到了很大的效果的，也为广大同学所欢迎。因此今后只要注意遵守自愿原则和不妨碍学习和健康，是应当继续广泛持久地开展下去的。
    第四、抓紧团的组织生活。目前高等学校中的青年团员，一般已占到全体学生的60％以上。青年团员是学生中的先进部分，我们要依靠先进帮助和带动落后，所以教育好青年团员是教育好全体学生的重要环节。对青年团员除了要求他们和全体同学一起接受教育外，还应当利用团的组织生活对他们进行更为严格的教育。团的组织生活是团员学习马克思列宁主义、训练革命的组织性纪律性和培养共产主义道德品质的学校。以往有些学校团的组织生活存在着不够严密、内容空泛、过于追求轻松愉快的缺点，因此对团员的教育和帮助不大。今后应当更严密一些，长期不过组织生活的现象必须消除；内容应当丰富和充实，举凡国内外的重大政治事件，党和政府的重要的政策法令，学术文化上的重要问题，群众一个时期的思想动态和意见要求等，都应当作为组织生活的课题而加以学习、讨论和研究。团的组织应当要求团员在阶级立场、思想作风和道德品质等方面起模范作用；要利用团的组织生活开展批评和自我批评，帮助团员克服缺点和错误，真正成为团结教育广大青年的核心。
    坚持理论联系实际  和说服教育的方法
    坚持理论联系实际和说服教育的方法，克服教条主义和粗暴简单的缺点，是作好思想政治教育工作的重要条件。所谓理论联系实际，就是要把讲道理和组织实践统一起来，通过读书、作报告、开讨论会等方式，懂得了一些基本道理，同时创设适当的条件组织一些实践性的活动去体现并巩固这些道理。这样不断反复，逐步深入。在作报告、开讨论会的时候，都要摸清群众的思想状况，找出问题的癥结在那里，然后对症下药，才能收到实实在在的效果。过去有些同志把教育青年的问题看得过于简单，以为只要讲一些空泛的大道理，提出这种或那种要求就行了，结果自然是不会好的。
    我们要大力加强马克思列宁主义的教育，但是绝不能强迫人们接受。我们要用启发自觉、以理服人的方法，使青年心悦诚服地在真理面前低头。目前还有一些学生在社会主义制度、党的领导、农民生活、文化艺术等问题上，有各种不同的意见和看法，应当放手地组织他们开展民主讨论。我们绝不害怕和掩盖矛盾，还要有意识地引导他们把各种见解无保留地说出来。对待各种错误思想，都不要用粗暴简单的办法打回去，而要心平气和地讲道理，靠道理来说服人家自觉地修正错误，接受真理。真理是在和错误作斗争中发展起来的，所以它会愈辩而愈明，产生不可抗拒的说服力。对待一般犯了错误的学生，也仍然要坚持说服教育，可以实事求是地批评，但不要粗暴地斥责，更不要随便斗争和处分。过去几年的教训告诉我们：教条主义和简单粗暴的教育方法，不但不可能收到教育的效果，而且还会造成青年生吞活剥条文，不会独立思考，自尊心和积极性受到挫伤的恶果，甚至还会引起个别学生产生对党的敌对情绪。
    最后，在谈到我们采取什么教育方法的时候，必须看到，我国的青年学生一直是在中国共产党的抚育下成长起来的，是富有革命精神的，绝大多数是诚心诚意地接受党的领导的，他们当中的一些错误思想，也是不难教育过来的。我们在立场观点、思想意识、道德品质这些重要的问题上一定要抓紧，但是应当十分爱护和支持他们正当的积极性；在加强思想政治教育的同时，要认真扩大民主生活，关心他们在教学上和生活上的正当要求。放手和领导相结合，尊重信任和加强教育相结合，这就是我们对待青年学生应当采取的态度。
