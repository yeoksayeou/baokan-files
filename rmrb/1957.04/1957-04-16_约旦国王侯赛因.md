Character Introduction:

    King Hussein of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan was born on November 14, 1935, and is currently 21 years old. He studied at Harrow School, a British aristocratic school, and then entered the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in 1952, where he trained for six months. He formally ascended the throne in May 1953. According to the constitution, he also serves as the commander-in-chief of the army, navy, and air force.

    Hussein's grandfather was Abdullah, the first king of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, and his father was the former King Talal. Talal was deposed in 1952 due to mental illness. Abdullah and Faisal I, the grandfather of Faisal II, the current king of the other Hashemite kingdom of Iraq, were brothers. Therefore, Hussein and King Faisal II of Iraq are cousins. They were also classmates at Harrow School.

    In March of last year, Hussein announced the removal of British General Glubb from his positions as Chief of General Staff of the Jordanian Army and Commander of the Arab Legion. After Jordan held parliamentary elections in October last year, a new cabinet was formed with the National Socialist Nabulsi as Prime Minister. This cabinet implemented a policy of safeguarding national independence and active neutrality, abolished the unequal Anglo-Jordanian treaty, opposed the Eisenhower Doctrine, opposed the Baghdad Pact, and decided to establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.

    On April 10, Hussein asked the Nabulsi cabinet to resign, causing a serious government crisis and plunging the national situation into tension and chaos.

    约旦国王侯赛因
    哈希米特约旦王国国王侯赛因生于1935年11月14日，现年21岁。他曾在英国贵族学校哈罗公学读书，1952年又进入桑德斯特皇家军校，受训半年。1953年5月正式即王位。根据宪法，他还兼任海陆空军总司令。
    侯赛因的祖父是哈希米特约旦王国的第一任国王阿卜杜拉，父亲是前国王泰拉尔。泰拉尔因患精神病于1952年被废黜。阿卜杜拉和另一哈希米特王国伊拉克现国王费萨尔二世的祖父费萨尔一世是亲兄弟。因此，侯赛因和伊拉克国王费萨尔二世是堂兄弟。他们还是哈罗公学的同学。
    去年3月，侯赛因宣布解除英国将军格拉布所担任的约旦陆军总参谋长和阿拉伯军团司令的职务。去年10月约旦举行议会选举后，成立了以国家社会党人纳布西为首相的新内阁。这个内阁执行维护民族独立和积极中立的政策，废除了英约不平等条约，反对艾森豪威尔主义，反对巴格达条约，决定同苏联建立外交关系。
    4月10日，侯赛因要求纳布西内阁辞职，引起了严重的政府危机，而且使全国局势陷于紧张和混乱。
