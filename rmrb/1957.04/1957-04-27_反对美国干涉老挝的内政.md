Oppose U.S. Interference in Laos' Internal Affairs
By a Commentator of this newspaper

On April 16th, the United States, in conjunction with the British and French governments, delivered identical notes to the Royal Lao Government. These notes crudely interfered in Laos' internal affairs, actively provoking relations between the Royal Lao Government and the Lao Fighting Units, attempting to disrupt the bilateral talks in Laos, obstruct the formation of a coalition government, and undermine Laos' policy of peace and neutrality, thereby reigniting tensions in Laos.

This destructive behavior by the United States is by no means accidental. Since the commencement of bilateral talks between the Royal Lao Government and the Lao Fighting Units in August of last year, the Lao people have achieved significant progress in their efforts for the peaceful unification of their country. Both sides agreed that Laos should pursue a policy of peace and neutrality and form a coalition government before holding supplementary general elections. These agreements have been warmly supported by the Lao people but fiercely opposed by the United States. The American "Nation" weekly, in its March 30th issue, revealed that at the end of last year, American diplomatic officials told Laos that if Lao personnel were accepted into the national government, the United States would no longer provide Laos with any "aid." The weekly also stated that American authorities have been implying that the entire agreement of December 28th (referring to the joint communique by Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma of the Royal Government and Prince Souphanouvong, representative of the Lao Fighting Units) should be cancelled, and the Royal Government should end all contact with the Lao side. The weekly also revealed that the United States has been attempting to instigate a coup in Vientiane.

However, these threats by the United States have not been able to shake the determination of the Lao people to realize the peaceful unification of their country. Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma of the Royal Lao Government stated to the National Assembly in March that he hoped to reach a detailed agreement with the Lao side on the formation of a coalition government before the parliamentary session on May 11th. On April 9th, he reiterated that the ongoing negotiations were still in progress. This situation is, of course, not to the liking of the United States, which seeks to control and enslave Laos. In order to undermine the Lao people's efforts to strive for peace and unification, the United States has openly interfered in Laos, and the Asian people, who deeply care about Laos, cannot but express their indignation and opposition to this.

The Chinese people have always maintained that Laos' internal problems should be resolved by the Lao people themselves, and no foreign country should interfere. The countries participating in the 1954 Geneva Conference made sacred guarantees to this effect. The United States has consistently opposed the Geneva Accords. However, Britain and France, as signatory countries to the Geneva Accords, are now following the United States in wantonly interfering in Laos' internal affairs, which will not bring any benefits to Britain and France themselves. In order to reach a satisfactory political solution, the two sides in Laos will inevitably have some differences of opinion. However, as long as both sides engage in sincere consultations with a genuine desire to seek national unification and reject all foreign interference, no difficulty cannot be overcome. We firmly believe that as long as the entire Lao people unite as one, any malicious interference and sabotage from foreign countries are destined to fail.

The Chinese people are faithful to the sacred obligation stipulated by the Geneva Accords of not interfering in Laos' internal affairs, and resolutely oppose any country's interference in Laos' internal affairs. The Chinese people firmly believe that through the efforts of the Lao people themselves, Laos will eventually become an independent, unified, democratic, and peaceful country.

    反对美国干涉老挝的内政
    本报评论员
    4月16日美国协同英、法政府给老挝王国政府一件内容相同的照会。这个照会粗暴地干涉了老挝的内政，极力挑拨老挝王国政府同寮国战斗部队之间的关系，企图破坏老挝的双方会谈，以阻挠联合政府的成立和破坏老挝的和平中立政策，从而在老挝重新挑起紧张局势。
    美国的这种破坏行为决不是偶然的。自从去年8月间老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队双方会谈开始以来，老挝人民在为祖国的和平统一的努力中已经取得了重大的成就。双方同意老挝应该执行和平中立政策，并在举行补充普选之前组织联合政府。这些协议获得了老挝人民的热烈支持，但是却遭到美国的激烈反对。3月30日一期的美国“民族”周刊就曾透露说，在去年年底，美国外交官员曾经对老挝说，如果寮方人员被接纳加入国家政府的话，美国将不再给予老挝任何“援助”。该周刊又说，美国当局一直在暗示，应该把12月28日的整个协定（按指王国政府首相富马和寮国战斗部队代表苏发努冯的联合公报）取消，王国政府应该结束同寮方的一切来往。周刊还透露，美国还企图在万象制造政变。
    但是，美国的这些威胁并没有能够动摇老挝人民准备实现国家的和平统一的决心。老挝王国首相富马曾于3月间向国民议会表示，他希望在5月11日议会开会以前能同寮方就成立联合政府一事达成细节协议。4月9日他再度表示，已经开始的谈判仍在进行。这种情况当然不为力图控制和奴役老挝的美国所喜欢。为了破坏老挝人民为争取和平和统一的努力，美国竟然对老挝采取了公开的干涉，深切关怀老挝的亚洲人民对此不能不表示愤慨和反对。
    中国人民一向认为老挝内部的问题应该由老挝人民自己解决，任何外国都不得加以干涉，参加1954年日内瓦会议的国家对此曾作了神圣的保证。美国是一直反对日内瓦协议的。但是英、法两国是日内瓦协议的签字国，现在竟追随美国对老挝内政横加干涉，这对英、法两国本身来说是不会带来任何好处的。老挝双方为了达成圆满的政治解决，意见的某些分歧总是会有的。但是只要双方本着谋求国家统一的真诚愿望，进行诚挚的协商，并拒绝一切外国干涉，便没有什么困难是不能克服的。我们深信只要老挝全体人民团结一致，任何来自外国的别有用心的干涉和破坏，都是注定要破产的。
    中国人民忠实于日内瓦协议所规定的不干涉老挝内政的神圣义务，也坚决反对任何国家对老挝的内政进行干涉。中国人民深信通过老挝人民自己的努力，老挝终将成为一个独立统一民主和平的国家。
