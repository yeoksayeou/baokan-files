    Should Not Publish Photos of Climbing Trees
    Comrade Editor:
    We saw a picture on page 4 of the People's Daily on April 16th, titled "Eager to See," which showed many people climbing trees to see Chairman Voroshilov. Everyone felt that it was inappropriate to publicize this in the newspaper.
    Climbing trees is a bad behavior. First of all, it is easy to damage trees, which is not conducive to greening efforts, and the government is calling for the protection of trees; at the same time, it is also unsafe for the tree climbers themselves. The Beijing Daily published a criticism not long ago of people climbing trees to watch circus performances, and that criticism was correct. Now that the People's Daily has published such a photo, it implicitly encourages tree climbing, which has a bad influence. We hope that you will also criticize tree climbers in the newspaper.

### 不应该登载爬树的照片

    不应该登载爬树的照片编辑同志：
    我们看到4月16日人民日报第四版的图片中有一张“很想看到”，照的是有好多人爬到树上去看欢迎伏罗希洛夫主席的情况。大家都感到报上这样宣传不妥。
    爬树是一种不好的行为。首先这很容易损坏树木，对绿化工作不利，而政府是号召保护树木的；同时，对爬树者本身说，也是不安全的。北京日报不久前曾经发表过批评有的人爬树看马戏表演的照片，那是批评得对的。现在人民日报刊登这样的照片，无形中有鼓励爬树之意，影响不好。希望你们对爬树的人也在报上批评一下吧。王东
