Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 11th: The Tibetan delegation returned to Lhasa yesterday. The head of the delegation, Sampo Tenzin Dondup, told a Tibet Daily reporter upon arrival in Lhasa that the delegation had seen the unity of all fraternal ethnic groups in the motherland, who are working actively and with full confidence to build socialism. He said that what impressed them the most was the development of political, economic, and cultural undertakings in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in Jilin Province after liberation, where even remote areas now have doctors for medical treatment, school-age children are attending school, and people's lives are improving year by year. These vivid examples have added strength to their efforts to build a new Tibet.

Upon arriving in Lhasa, the delegation was warmly welcomed by more than 500 people from Party, government, and military organs. The head of the delegation, Sampo Tenzin Dondup, and other representatives who came to welcome them exchanged hadas.

After arriving in Beijing in September last year, the Tibetan delegation participated in the National Day celebrations in 1956 and visited twenty-one provinces and cities in the mainland. The honorary head of the delegation, Pagbalha Geleg Namgyal, is still in the mainland after attending the Third Plenary Session of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC.

    西藏参观团回到拉萨
    新华社拉萨11日电　西藏参观团昨天回到拉萨。团长桑颇·才旺仁增在抵达拉萨时向西藏日报记者说，参观团在内地看到了祖国各兄弟民族团结一致，正在满怀信心地为建设社会主义而积极工作。他说，他们感受最深的是内蒙古自治区和吉林省延边朝鲜族自治州解放后政治、经济和文化事业的发展，那里的边远地区已经有医生看病，学龄儿童进了学校，人民的生活正在逐年改善。这些生动的事例给他们建设新西藏增添了力量。
    参观团在到达拉萨时，受到党、政、军各机关五百多人的热烈欢迎。团长桑颇·才旺仁增等和前来欢迎的代表们互献了哈达。
    西藏参观团在去年9月到达北京后，曾经参加1956年国庆节观礼，并在内地二十一个省市进行了参观访问。参观团的名誉团长帕巴拉活佛在参加政协第二届全国委员会第三次全体会议后，尚留在内地。
