    Educate Recent Graduates to Correctly Treat Further Education and Employment Issues
    Liaoning Province's Primary and Secondary Schools Universally Strengthen Political and Ideological Work
    (Our Report) Liaoning Province's middle and primary schools in various regions have universally strengthened political and ideological work for recent graduates, educating students to correctly treat further education and employment issues. Party committees and education departments in various regions have strengthened their political and ideological leadership over schools. The Dalian-Lushun Municipal Education Bureau convened a meeting of school leading cadres to specifically study the strengthening of political and ideological work for students. The CPC Liaoyang Prefectural Committee, in addition to convening a meeting of county party committee cultural and educational ministers to put forward specific opinions, also formed a working group after the meeting to investigate and study and inspect work in key counties. The CPC Anshan Municipal Committee's Propaganda Department and Municipal Education Bureau, and the CPC Jinzhou Municipal Committee, the Municipal Communist Youth League Committee, and the Municipal Education Bureau, jointly convened meetings to study the work of graduates.
    In response to students' ideological situations, middle and primary schools in various regions have adopted diverse forms of education. Middle schools in Dalian-Lushun have restored political classes, with school leaders giving lectures, conducting class education, labor education, and education on the prospects of further education, employment, and self-study for recent graduates. Many middle schools in Dalian have also convened parent meetings, requesting them to take responsibility for educating their children. Shenyang No. 1 Middle School established a guidance committee for graduate work and convened a joint class meeting of six junior high school graduating classes on March 15 to help students understand the country's education policy.
    The political and ideological education of this stage has achieved preliminary results. Most recent graduates in Dalian-Lushun have a clearer understanding of further education and employment issues, expressing that they will concentrate on their studies for now, and if they can pursue further education, they will, and if they cannot, they will participate in labor or organize self-study. Ge Xing'an, a student in the third grade of Fuxian No. 1 Junior High School, said after hearing the report of graduates of the school who participated in production: I have already discussed it with my father, and when I fail to get into high school, I will go home to participate in agricultural production and build a new countryside.

    教育应届毕业生正确对待升学和就业问题
    辽宁省中小学普遍加强政治思想工作
    本报讯　辽宁省各地中、小学普遍加强了对应届毕业生的政治思想工作，教育学生正确地对待升学和就业问题。各地党委和教育部门都加强了对学校的政治思想领导。旅大市教育局曾召开学校领导干部会议，专门研究加强对学生的政治思想工作。中共辽阳地委除了召开各县委文教部长会议，提出具体意见外，会后又组成工作组去重点县调查研究和检查工作。中共安东市委文教部和市教育局，中共锦州市委、团市委和市教育局，都联合召开了研究毕业生工作的会议。
    各地中、小学针对学生的思想情况，采用了多种多样的形式进行教育。旅大市各中学恢复了政治课，由学校的负责同志讲课，向应届毕业生进行阶级教育、劳动教育和升学、就业、自学的前途教育。大连许多中学，还召开家长会议，要求他们负起教育子女的责任。沈阳市第一中学成立了指导毕业生工作委员会，并在3月15日召开初中六个毕业班联合班会，帮助学生认识国家的教育方针政策。
    这一阶段的政治思想教育已取得初步成绩。旅大市大部分应届毕业生对升学和就业问题有了较为明确的认识，表示目前要安心学习，将来能升学就升学，不能升学就参加劳动或组织自学。复县第一初中三年级学生葛行安听了参加生产的该校毕业生的报告后说：我已和父亲商量好了，考不上高中时就回家参加农业生产，建设新农村。
