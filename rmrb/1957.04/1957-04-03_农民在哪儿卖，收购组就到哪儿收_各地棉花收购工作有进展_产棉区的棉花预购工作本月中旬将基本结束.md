    “Acquisition teams go wherever farmers sell cotton”
    Cotton acquisition work progresses in various locations
    Cotton pre-purchase work in cotton-producing areas will be basically completed by mid-month
    (Our newspaper dispatch) Since the State Council instructed various localities to strengthen cotton acquisition work, cotton acquisition has improved due to the full efforts of supply and marketing cooperatives under the leadership of local Party and government organizations. Taking Hebei and Jiangsu, two major cotton-producing provinces, as examples, cotton acquisition volume in early March increased by more than double compared to late February.
    In the cotton acquisition work, various localities, based on the characteristic of relatively scattered cotton storage in rural areas, adopted the method of organizing forces to go deep into agricultural cooperatives and farmers' households for mobile acquisition. Acquisition teams buy wherever the masses sell, buying one catty if there is one catty, and half a catty if there is half a catty. All unnecessary procedures have been eliminated, which has provided great convenience for farmers to sell cotton, causing cotton acquisition volume to trend upwards. Since the Spring Festival, Anyang County, Henan Province, organized a total of forty mobile acquisition teams by early March, going to the countryside 128 times, acquiring more than 16,600 catties of ginned cotton, accounting for 55% of the total acquisition during the same period. The mobile acquisition team organized by the Houma Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Quwo County, Shanxi Province, brought scales and funds, contracted by township, acquired on the spot, and entrusted agricultural cooperatives to transport on the spot. On February 19 alone, the amount of cotton acquired reached more than 10,000 catties, equivalent to ten days of acquisition volume when mobile acquisition was not organized. Cixi County, Zhejiang Province, was originally a severely affected disaster area. When the supply and marketing cooperative put forward the slogan "Save to survive the famine and support the national textile industry" and added twenty-two mobile acquisition scales, the daily cotton acquisition volume reached 2,300 catties, an increase of seven times compared to before.
    According to investigations and understanding in various places, many agricultural cooperatives still have cotton in storage, and most of the picked and harvested boll cotton and fallen flowers of the broad masses of members have not been sold. Although these cotton storages are relatively scattered, the potential is still considerable. At present, supply and marketing cooperatives in various places are continuing to carry out acquisition work, striving to acquire all existing cotton in rural areas as soon as possible to ensure the production needs of the textile industry.
    Also, it is reported that major cotton-producing provinces such as Hebei, Jiangsu, Shandong, Hubei, Henan, and Shanxi require all localities to fully complete the signing of pre-purchase contracts before spring planting. By late March, Shulu County, Shijiazhuang Prefecture, Hebei Province, had completed the signing of pre-purchase contracts. Various counties in Jiangsu Province have transferred a large number of cadres to grassroots units to help with the work, requiring that the pre-purchase task be active and reliable, and the procedures be simple and not chaotic; Shandong Province has proposed to issue advance deposits in a timely manner and do a good job in the supply of production and living materials to ensure the completion of the state's pre-purchase task. It is estimated that the cotton pre-purchase work in various places can be basically completed before mid-April.

    “农民在哪儿卖，收购组就到哪儿收”
    各地棉花收购工作有进展
    产棉区的棉花预购工作本月中旬将基本结束
    本报讯　自从国务院指示各地加强棉花收购工作以后，由于各地供销合作社在当地党政机关的领导下，全力进行收购，使棉花的收购情况已经有所好转。以河北、江苏两个主要产棉省为例，3月上旬的棉花收购量比2月下旬上升了一倍以上。
    在棉花收购工作中，各地根据农村存棉比较零星分散的特点，采取了组织力量深入农业社和农户进行流动收购的方法，群众在哪儿卖，收购组就在哪儿买，有一斤收一斤，有半斤收半斤，并取消了一切不必要的手续，这就给了农民出售棉花以很大方便，使棉花收购量趋向上升。河南安阳县自从春节到3月上旬，共组织了四十个流动收购组，先后下乡达一百二十八次，共收购皮棉一万六千六百多斤，占同期收购总量的55％。山西曲沃县侯马供销社组织的流动收购组，带秤带款、分乡包干、就地收购、就地委托农业社起运，仅2月19日这一天收购的棉花就达到一万多斤，相当于未组织流动收购时十天的收购量。浙江慈溪县原属重灾区，当供销社提出“节约渡荒、支援国家纺织工业”的口号，并增加二十二支流动收购秤后，每日棉花收购量达到二千三百斤，较前提高七倍。
    据各地调查了解，目前还有不少农业社存有棉花，广大社员群众收摘的剥桃棉、落地花大部分都没有卖出。虽然这些存棉比较零星分散，但潜力还是相当大的。现在，各地供销社正在继续进行收购工作，争取尽快地把农村现有存棉全部收购上来，以保证纺织工业的生产需要。
    又讯　河北、江苏、山东、湖北、河南、山西等主要产棉省，要求各地在春播以前全面完成预购合同的签订工作。河北省石家庄专区束鹿县，到3月下旬已完成了预购合同的签订工作。江苏省各县已抽调大批干部到基层单位去帮助工作，要求做到预购任务积极可靠，手续简而不乱；山东省提出，及时发放预付定金，做好生产、生活资料的物资供应工作，以保证完成国家预购的任务。预计在4月中旬以前，各地即可基本完成棉花预购工作。
