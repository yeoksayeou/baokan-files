	One Day at the Xinle Agricultural Cooperative

	The spring plowing season in the southern Yangtze River Delta has begun. It was during this wonderful time that we came to the Xinle Agricultural Cooperative in Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province, to share in the joy brought by the spring labor with the farmers here.

	Early in the morning, we stepped outside to a field shrouded in morning mist. In the threshing ground not far from our residence, several dark figures were moving about. Upon closer inspection, we found that the members' day of labor had already begun. These were several male and female members selecting and soaking seeds for the double-cropping early rice. One member was using a bamboo sieve to scoop out the empty grains from the muddy water, while another was carrying two buckets of water from the river, pouring it into the vat containing the good seeds. Everyone was busy.

	After breakfast, we walked out of Yaojiabin, where the Xinle production team was located.

	The morning mist gradually dissipated. The Jiangnan countryside after the rain was especially beautiful. Patches of wheat, rapeseed, and red clover (green manure) covered the black earth.

	Standing in Yaojiabin and looking west, a group of Xinle production team girls in red and blue were hoeing and turning the seedling fields under the sunlight, preparing seedling beds for the double-cropping early rice. At the eastern end of Yaojiabin, the oxen of the Xinqiao production team were pulling waterwheels, irrigating the newly turned seedling fields. The cooperative cadre told us, "Our cooperative's sowing work began on March 29th and will be completed by April 4th. Come back and see us then, and you'll see a new look here!"

	While in the Xinmin production team, we visited the home of Liu Qinlai, an old farmer in his sixties, and talked with him about the differences between this year's production and last year's. He is a humorous old farmer. He began by saying, "Last year's production only involved cadres giving orders, without any room for discussion among us members. The cadres told us to stand at attention, and we stood at attention; they told us to stand at ease, and we stood at ease – how can production be like the People's Liberation Army doing exercises!" This analogy immediately revealed the shortcomings in last year's production leadership. Speaking of this year's production, Liu Qinlai said excitedly, "This year is completely different. At the cooperative's members' representative meeting, the members were allowed to democratically discuss how much double-cropping rice the cooperative should plant this year and how to plant it. I made several suggestions at the meeting: first, double-cropping rice should be planted, but not too much at once; second, the seedling fields should be selected from small, fertile fields close to the homestead. If these two conditions are met, I guarantee a yield of eight or nine hundred catties of double-cropping rice per mu. Both of these suggestions were adopted by the members' representative meeting, which really pleased me! Now, the production team is also implementing 'three guarantees': each team selects, turns over, and hoes its own small plots of land; those not used for seedling fields are left for red clover." The old farmer became more and more excited as he spoke, and simply pulled us to the dirt field at the entrance to point out, "You see, the bamboo stakes planted in this red clover field are for seedling fields; the place where the grass is tied to the bamboo poles is for green manure fields. This year, the members won't be like last year, when they plowed everything under before the green manure had even grown."

	While we were talking, a plump and strong ox on the edge of the field caught our attention. The old man said: this ox was bought from another village four years ago, and it is only eight years old now. Last year, it plowed more than one hundred mu of seedling fields. Just as he was speaking, the old man's youngest son, Liu Daorong, brought over a bucket of high-quality feed. Strangely enough, the ox rummaged around in the feed bucket with its nose but didn't eat. We thought the ox was sick. Old man Liu smiled and said, "It's not sick, it's just being stubborn, seeing you strangers, afraid you're here to buy it! Look, its eyes are even red." With that, the old man led the ox into the shed. When the old man brought the feed to it again, the ox ate it with gusto. The old man patted the ox's neck and said affectionately, "I've worked hard to raise you, you dumb son, I wouldn't want to sell you! The cooperative still has a big use for you in spring plowing!"

	We walked through several of the cooperative's production teams, and the members were all very friendly to us. According to the cadres, this is a new phenomenon resulting from democratic cooperative management, especially after the cadres went to the fields to participate in production.

	Last year was the first year of the cooperative's establishment, and also the first time double-cropping rice was planted on a large scale. Sometimes, the cooperative had to hold three or four meetings a day. The main cadres did not participate in production, which also affected all twenty-three cooperative committee members and production team leaders, who did not participate in production full-time, and the masses had a lot of complaints.

	This year, after the Spring Festival, the cadres participated in production, and their relationship with the masses became closer. Several cadres we spoke to mentioned, without exception, how cooperative director Peng Xingyu, while participating in production, worked with the masses on the spot to develop new methods for managing summer crops in the fields. This year, after the Spring Festival, the accumulated snow melted, and the summer crop fields urgently needed to be ditched and drained; however, many members were unwilling to go to the fields after the holiday. Director Peng led some members to the fields on the third day of the Lunar New Year to drain the water, and at the same time asked the old farmer Peng Jinquan how to get everyone to care about the summer crops. The old farmer said, "It would be good if everyone was assigned to take care of their own plots." So, they jointly discussed a "fixing the field to the person, fixing the work to the field" system of responsibility for summer crop field production.

	We heard that this system of responsibility for field production was also being considered for implementation in rice field management, so we went to talk to Director Peng about this issue. However, we ran around to several places this day and finally found him in the wheat field of the Xinqiao production team. This fifty-seven-year-old director was draining water along the edge of the field he was responsible for managing. He told us, "Now that we have the field responsibility system, things are much better. You see, it's rare to find a plot of land with standing water. As soon as the rain stops, every household comes to dig ditches. It's really 'the fields dry after the rain'."

	A busy and pleasant day passed. However, the cadres who were working hard for the whole cooperative were still discussing the issue of strengthening the leadership of the production team and establishing a field responsibility system.

	We participated in this meeting. There were no grand reports, no central speeches. At the meeting, everyone debated how to strengthen the members' sense of responsibility for production. Initially, the team cadres did not agree with the field responsibility system. Some said it was too troublesome; some said it was going back to individual farming; some said the lazybones would definitely disagree. Finally, opinions gradually converged, and everyone agreed that the six major benefits of the field responsibility system were: strengthening the members' sense of responsibility; ensuring the quality of work; avoiding the phenomenon of assigning work every day and evaluating work every day; reducing the workload of the cadres; and allowing the members to play an active role. So, would this lead back to the path of individual farming? "No," the cooperative cadres explained: "The system of assigning responsibility to people and households only involves managing the field work that has already been cultivated, with different content in each period, and the cooperative allocates a certain amount of work point remuneration. As for the unit yield per mu, the agricultural cost, and the cultivation, these are still planned by each production team and collectively distributed through collective labor, so this will not lead to individual farming."

	If anyone asks us what the deepest impression of this cooperative's spring plowing production activities is, our answer is: this year, the agricultural production work of this cooperative has taken a solid step forward compared to 1956, which was full of enthusiasm but lacked experience.

### 新乐农业社的一天

专栏：

    新乐农业社的一天
    长江三角洲南部的春耕生产开始了。就在这个美好的时候，我们来到了江苏省松江县新乐农业社，同这里的农民一道分享春天的劳动带来的喜悦。
    清晨，我们走出门外，一片朝雾弥漫了田野。在离我们住处不远的打谷场上，有几个黑影在闪动。走近一看，原来社员们一天的劳动已经开始了。这是几个男女社员在为双季早稻选种、浸种。一个社员正用竹筛捞去泥水中的瘪谷，另一个社员正从河边挑来两桶水，倒在盛着良种的缸里。人们都在忙碌着。
    早饭后，我们走出新乐生产队所在地的姚家滨。
    晨雾渐渐散去。雨后的江南原野分外美丽。一片片的小麦、油菜、红花草（绿肥）遮盖了黑色的土地。
    站在姚家滨向西一望，阳光下新乐生产队一群穿红着蓝的姑娘们正在锄翻秧田，为双季早稻做秧池。在姚家滨的东头，新乔生产队的耕牛正牵引着水车，戽水灌溉新翻的秧田。社干告诉我们：“我们社的播种工作3月29日开始，4月4日就可以全部结束，到那时你们再来看看，我们这里又有一番气象了！”
    在新民生产队的时候，我们到六十多岁的老农柳琴来家里做客，同他谈今年生产和去年的不同地方。这是一位富于幽默感的老农。他一开头就说：“去年生产只有干部下命令，没有我们社员讨论的余地，干部叫立正就立正，叫稍息就稍息——生产?，那能像解放军出操一样！”这一个譬喻，一下就道破了去年领导生产上的缺点。谈起今年的生产，柳琴来兴奋地说：“今年大不相同了，社里的社员代表大会上，让社员民主讨论：今年全社究竟种多少双季稻，怎样种法。我在会上提了几条意见：第一条是双季稻要种，可是不能一下种得太多；第二条是秧田要选靠宅基近的小块肥田。如果这两个条件做到，我保证一亩双季稻收八百九十斤。这两条意见全被社员代表大会采纳了，真称我的心！现在，生产队又在搞‘三包’了，小块田由各队自己选择，翻好，锄好；不做秧田的，留着红花草。”这位老农越说越高兴，索性拉我们到门口土场上指点着说：“你们看，这红花草田里插的竹标就是做秧田的；那边竹竿上绑草的地方就是绿肥田。今年社员不会像去年那样，不等绿肥长成就全部翻耕掉了。”
    我们正在谈话的时候，场边上一条膘满肉壮的大犍牛吸引住我们。老人说：这条牛是四年前他从别乡买来的，长到现在才不过八岁口，去年它就耕了一百多亩秧田。正说间，老人的小儿子柳道荣端上一桶上好的草料。说也奇怪，那牛用鼻子在草料桶里拱来拱去，却不吃料。我们以为这条牛生病了。柳老伯笑着说：“它不会病，是放刁，看见你们几个生人，怕是来买它呢！你看它眼都红了。”说着，这个老人牵着牛往棚里走。等到老人再把草料端到它面前，那牛竟大嚼大吃起来了。老人拍着牛颈，亲热地说：“辛辛苦苦养你这个哑吧儿子，那里还舍得卖你呵！社里春耕生产还得派你大用场呢！”
    我们走过这个社的好几个生产队，社员对我们都显得十分亲热。据干部说：这是民主办社，特别是干部下田参加生产以后的新气象。
    去年是建社第一年，又是第一次大面积种双季稻，社里有时候一天要开三、四个会。主要干部不参加生产，也牵连到全社二十三个社务委员和生产队长都没有整天参加生产，群众很有意见。
    今年春节后，干部参加了生产，他们同群众的关系密切了。我们接触到的几个干部，都曾不约而同地讲起社主任彭兴余在参加生产过程中就地同群众研究出夏熟田间管理新办法的事情。今年春节后，积雪融化，夏熟田急需开沟排水；可是许多社员节后不愿下地。彭主任带领一些社员在大年初三就下田去排水，同时向老农彭进泉请教怎样才能叫大家对夏熟田关心。这个老农说：“要是各人分工包管就好。”于是，他们就共同商量出一种“以人定田，以田定工”的夏熟田间生产责任制。
    听说这种田间生产责任制还准备推广到稻田管理上，我们就去找彭主任谈谈这个问题。但是，这一天我们白跑了好几个地方，好容易才在新乔生产队的麦田找到。这位五十七岁的老主任正在他自己负责管理的地边排水。他告诉我们：“现在有了田间责任制，好多了，你看，难得有一块田有积水。只要雨一住，家家户户都来开沟。真是雨过田干。”
    紧张而愉快的一天过去了。但是，为全社辛苦奔忙的干部们还在讨论着加强生产队的领导，建立田间责任制的问题。
    我们参加了这个会议，会上没有大报告，没有中心发言。会议上，大家对怎样加强社员生产责任心的问题发生了争论。起初，田间责任制并没有得到队干部的同意。有人说这样太麻烦；有人说这样是不是又要单干了；有人说这样做懒汉一定不同意。终于意见渐渐接近，一致公认田间责任制的六大好处是：加强社员责任心；保证做活质量好；避免天天派工、日日评工现象；干部工作省力；社员可以发挥主动性。那么这样做是不是会回到单干的路上去呢？“不”，社干部又解释说：“定人定户责任制只负责已耕作好的田间农活管理，每个时期有不同的内容，社里拨发一定的工分报酬。至于每亩田的单位产量、农本和耕作还是由各生产队计划好，由集体劳动集体分配的，这样不会走到单干去。”
    要是有人问我们，这个社的春耕生产活动给人最深的印象是什么呢？我们的回答是：今年这个合作社的农业生产工作，比起热情有余、经验不足的1956年来，已经踏踏实实地向前跨进了一大步了。
