Xinhua News Agency reporter Li Chen reports: Anshan Iron and Steel (An’gang), in the upsurge of the campaign to increase production and practice economy, has increased national production in the first quarter of this year by more than 30,000 tons of steel, 26,000 tons of steel, 14,000 tons of pig iron, and 80,000 tons of ore.

The miners working at Dagushan Open-Pit Iron Mine, An'gang's main ore base, began using the double-row eye blasting method, which can increase output by one time, and increased national production by more than 58,000 tons of ore in the first quarter. Thanks to the support of the Chemical Plant and Sintering Plant in producing high-quality coke and artificial rich ore, the production of the Ironmaking Plant has improved month by month, and it overfulfilled the plan and produced more than 12,000 tons of pig iron for the country in March. The Steelmaking Plant, which increased national production by more than 7,000 tons of steel in the first two months of this year, increased national production by more than 4,000 tons of steel in March. In the first quarter of this year, the average time for each furnace of steelmaking in this plant was more than 40 minutes shorter than in the same period last year. Workers in the Primary Rolling, Heavy Rolling, Medium Rolling, Seamless and other steel rolling mills not only increased national production by more than 30,000 tons of steel in the first quarter, but also significantly improved product quality. The first-class product rate of various steel products rolled by the Heavy Rolling Mill in February was on average 4.82% higher than the national plan, and the quality of steel products in March was even better than in February.

Anshan Iron and Steel's production grew rapidly in the first quarter of this year. Compared with the same period last year, steel increased by more than 260,000 tons, steel increased by nearly 200,000 tons, and pig iron also increased by more than 120,000 tons.

    钢铁生产战线上的出色劳动
    鞍钢第一季度增产大量钢铁和钢材
    新华社记者李沉报道：在增产节约运动中的鞍钢职工，今年第一季度为国家增产了三万多吨钢材、二万六千多吨钢、一万四千多吨生铁和八万多吨矿石。
    在鞍钢的主要矿石基地——大孤山露天铁矿工作的矿工们，开始使用了可以使产量提高一倍的双排眼爆破法，第一季度为国家增产了五万八千多吨矿石。由于化工总厂和烧结总厂生产优等质量的焦炭和人造富矿的支援，炼铁厂的生产一月比一月好，三月份超计划给国家多生产了一万二千多吨生铁。在今年头两个月中为国家增产七千多吨钢的炼钢厂，在三月份又给国家增产了四千多吨钢。今年第一季度这个厂每炼一炉钢的时间平均比去年同期缩短了四十多分钟。初轧、大型、中型、无缝等各轧钢厂的工人，第一季度不仅给国家增产了三万多吨钢材，而且在产品质量方面也有显著的提高。大型轧钢厂在二月份所轧制的各种钢材一级品率平均比国家计划提高4.82％，而三月份钢材质量比二月份还要好。
    今年第一季度鞍钢生产增长很快。同去年同时期相比，钢材增加了二十六万多吨、钢增加将近二十万吨、生铁也增加了十二万多吨。
