    Polish Expert Cwierczak
    Su Wubing, Student of the Polish Language Class, Beijing Russian Language Institute

    The Polish government delegation's visit to our country is a major event in the friendly relations between China and Poland. As a Chinese student currently studying Polish, I would like to talk about Sino-Polish friendship and the sincere help of Polish comrades, based on my personal experience. I clearly remember one early autumn evening in September 1954, in front of the Russian Language Building at Peking University, when we, the first group of students preparing to study Polish in China, waited with great excitement to meet the Polish expert who would be teaching us Polish.
    When the Polish expert arrived, we all rushed forward to shake his hand. As soon as we met, the expert said to us, "Polish is the most difficult language to learn in Europe. Are you afraid of difficulties? However, the friendship between China and Poland is developing day by day, so we should not be afraid, and we must learn it, and we must learn it well." Hearing this, we were both afraid and motivated. In fact, if it is said that we have great difficulties in learning, then he has even greater difficulties in teaching: there were no dictionaries, no books, and no ready-made handouts; and most of us didn't understand any foreign languages. To teach all these people Polish, who can say it is easy?
    However, expert Cwierczak has been working with confidence and enthusiasm for three years as if it was just one day. He not only had to set teaching plans, compile handouts, and teach, but also had to give students individual tutoring, and even had to type himself at the beginning. We can hardly express his spirit of internationalism by piling up words such as serious, enthusiastic, conscientious, and responsible.
    In teaching, he not only had plans for each academic year and semester, but also for each week and each day. In order to carry out the teaching according to the plan, he even insisted on writing letters to arrange for us to study on our own when he was sick in bed with a high fever. When he found that our Chinese-to-Polish translation level was very low, he came up with a semester assignment—each person should translate a longer and deeper Chinese work. When some of our classmates translated, they only paid attention to whether the Polish language was beautiful or not, but they did not pay enough attention to the appropriateness and accuracy of the translation. Some students even thought that the expert would not understand Chinese anyway, as long as the grammar of the Polish translation was correct. Who knew that expert Cwierczak would work hard to learn Chinese in order to better help us with our translation assignments. During the exam, he took out our semester assignments and asked, "The original text says mutton, how did you translate it into beef?" "There are several very important sentences in the fifth paragraph of the original text, why did you drop them?" "The original text does not say sneeze, why did you add sneeze?..." At this time, the students were all taken aback, surprised by these sudden questions, and even more admired his serious and responsible spirit. Indeed, expert Cwierczak has never been sloppy in his work since the day he arrived in China.
    As for his attitude towards students, I really don't know what to say. If he is not strict, he not only does not allow us to do his assignments hastily, but also requires us to hand them in on time; if anyone looks around and does not pay attention in class, he can immediately see it and will immediately ask you to answer his questions. If he is very strict, he is not like some teachers who only care about students' grades and ignore students' rest, assigning a lot of homework to students every holiday. On the contrary, expert Cwierczak never assigns us holiday homework, and also repeatedly tells us to have a good rest and go out and play. During several major festivals, he personally went to each of our dormitories to see us and urged us to go out to participate in cultural and sports activities.
    Expert Cwierczak's teaching quality is very high. Whether it is the teaching materials he writes or selects, they are articles that highly combine artistry and ideology. He requires us to pay attention not only to the use of Polish when writing or answering questions, but also to the ideological content.
    Thanks to the efforts of expert Cwierczak, the students in our class have initially mastered Polish. As early as the second semester of last year, six people were selected to serve as teaching assistants for the first and second grades. Under the direct guidance of the expert, their teaching work was also completed very well.
    Every time I pick up Polish newspapers and magazines to read, I think of expert Cwierczak's selfless internationalist spirit. My classmates and I sincerely thank the Polish Party and government for sending us such an excellent expert.

    波兰专家崔热克
    北京俄语学院波兰语文班学生　粟武兵
    波兰政府代表团到我国来访问是中波友好关系中的一件大事。作为一个正在学习着波兰语文的中国学生，我愿以亲身的感受来谈谈中波友谊和波兰同志对我们的真诚的帮助。我清楚地记得，1954年9月间的一个初秋的傍晚，在北京大学俄文楼前，我们第一批准备在国内学习波兰语的学生，以非常兴奋的心情等待着和即将教授我们波兰语的波兰专家见面。
    当波兰专家来到的时候，我们都拥上去争着和他握手。一见面，专家就对我们说：“波兰语是欧洲最难学的语言，你们怕困难吗？但是，波中两国友谊日益发展，我们不应该害怕，一定要学它，也一定要学好。”听了这话，我们真是又害怕，又有劲头。其实，如果说我们学的困难大，那么他教的困难就更大了：没有字典，没有书，也没有现成的讲义；而我们这些人绝大多数还是不懂任何外文的。要把这些人都教会波兰文，谁能说容易呢？
    但是，崔热克专家三年如一日，他一直满怀信心和热情地工作着。他不但要订教学计划，编写讲义，授课，而且还要给学生进行个别辅导，甚至最初还要他亲自打字。我们把严肃、热情、认真、负责等等词汇堆集起来，也难以表现他的国际主义的精神。
    在教学中，他不仅有每学年和每学期的计划，还有每星期、每天的计划。为了按计划进行教学，他甚至病在床上发高烧的时候，还坚持写信布置我们自学。当他发现我们中译波的水平很低时，就想出了一种学期作业——每人译一篇较长也较深的中国作品。我们有的同学翻译时，就光注意波兰语用得美不美，而对译文的妥贴确切却注意不够。有的同学甚至以为专家反正看不懂中文，只要波译文的语法没有毛病就行了。谁知崔热克专家为了对我们的翻译作业进行更好的帮助，他努力地学习中文。在考试时，他拿出了我们的学期作业问道：“原文上写的是羊肉，你怎么译成了牛肉？”“原文第五段中还有很重要的几句，你怎么把它丢了？”“原文没有说打喷嚏，你为什么要加上打喷嚏呢？……”这时同学们都大吃一惊，对于这些突如其来的问题感到意外，而对于他这种认真负责的精神更感到钦佩。的确，崔热克专家打从到中国那天起，在工作中是从来也没有马虎过的。
    至于他对学生的态度，我真不知应该怎样说。说不严格吧，他布置的作业不仅不允许我们草草了事，而且一定要按时交；课堂上谁要是东张西望，不注意听，他马上就能看出，会立刻要你回答他的问题。如果说他很严格吧，他却不像某些老师那样，只要学生的成绩，不顾学生的休息，每到假日布置一大堆作业给学生。恰恰相反，崔热克专家从不布置我们假日作业，而且还要再三叮嘱我们，好好休息，出去玩玩。在几个大的节日里，他还亲自到我们每间宿舍里看我们，督促我们出去参加文化和体育活动。
    崔热克专家的教学质量是很高的。无论他写的或选的讲义材料，都是艺术性和思想性高度结合的文章。他要求我们写作或回答问题也不仅要注意运用波兰语，还要注意思想内容。
      由于崔热克专家的努力，我们班的同学已初步掌握了波兰语。早在去年下学期，就抽出了六个人担任一二年级的助教，在专家直接指导下，他们的教学工作也完成得很出色。
    每当我拿起波兰报章杂志阅读的时候，我就会想起崔热克专家这种忘我劳动的国际主义精神。我和我的同学们都衷心地感谢波兰的党和政府给我们派来了这样优秀的专家。
