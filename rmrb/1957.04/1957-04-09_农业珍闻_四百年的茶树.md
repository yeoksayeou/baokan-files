    Agricultural Curiosities
    Four-Hundred-Year-Old Tea Tree
    According to Xinhua News Agency, a large tea tree that has grown for approximately four hundred years is still sprouting lush young leaves this year. This tea tree is planted on Nannuo Mountain in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province. The trunk has a diameter of eighty-eight centimeters, and one person cannot embrace it with outstretched arms. The spread of its branches and leaves resembles a roof. It is the largest tea tree discovered in Xishuangbanna to date, and locals call it the "Tea King."
    The owner of this tea tree is Ce Kang, a Hani farmer from Banpoxia Village on Nannuo Mountain. He says that the Tea King tree has been passed down for six or seven generations, estimating it to be about four hundred years old now. In the past, it could produce fifty catties of tea leaves each year. Before liberation, because tea prices were too low, no one cared for the tea tree, and three bears made their nests in the tree.
    Xishuangbanna is a major producing area of large-leaf tea in our country. The largest tea leaves are about one Chinese foot long, and most of the existing tea trees are over fifty years old. The "Pu'er tea," which enjoys a high reputation both at home and abroad, is made from this kind of tea leaf.
    Seven-Foot-Four-Inch Tall Tobacco
    This newspaper reports: In Labao Village, Luxi County, Yunnan, a tobacco plant measuring seven feet and four inches tall grows beside the vegetable plot of farmer Li Guanghan's home. This tobacco plant was planted in 1943 and is now fourteen years old.
    This tobacco plant does not flower or produce seeds. Locals call it perennial tobacco or male tobacco. It produces over two hundred tobacco leaves, each measuring 1.6 to 1.8 Chinese feet long, every year. Its leaf color and aroma are the same as flue-cured tobacco. (Yunnan Peasant Newspaper)

    农业珍闻
    四百年的茶树
    据新华社讯　一株生长了大约四百年的大茶树，今年仍发出茂盛的嫩叶。这株茶树种植在云南省西双版纳傣族自治州的南糯山上，树干直径有八十八公分，一个人伸出双手还抱不拢，枝叶张开像一个屋顶。它是西双版纳目前被发现的最大茶树，当地人都叫它“茶王”。
    这株茶树的主人是南糯山半坡下寨的哈尼族农民测康。他说，茶王树已经传了六、七代人，推算到现在大约四百年左右。过去每年可采茶叶五十斤，解放前因为茶价太低，无人爱护茶树，有三只熊在树上做了窝。
    西双版纳是我国大叶种茶的主要产区，最大的茶叶长约一市尺，现有茶树大都在五十年以上。在国内外享有盛名的“普洱茶”，就是用这种茶叶制成的。
    七尺四寸高的烟
    本报讯　云南泸西县拉保村农民李光汉家的菜地边上，生长着一棵七尺四寸高的烟。这棵烟，是1943年种下的，到现在已经有十四年了。
    这棵烟，不开花，也不结籽，当地人叫它宿根烟或公烟。它每年生一尺六寸到一尺八寸长的烟叶二百多片。它的叶色和香味与烤烟相同。　（云南农民报）
