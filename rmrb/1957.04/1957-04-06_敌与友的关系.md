    The Relationship Between Enemies and Friends
    Xu Xuanzheng
    Wang Chong of the Eastern Han Dynasty was a strong critic of superstition. However, he had a fellow townsman and friend named Xie Yiwu, who was listed in the "Biographies of Fangshu" in the "Book of the Later Han," meaning he was someone who practiced superstition. Once, Xie Yiwu was ordered by his superior to deal with the crimes of the magistrate of Wucheng County; after arriving in the county, he did nothing, just cried loudly, and then returned, leaving people puzzled. He reported to his superior that, according to his divination, the magistrate of Wucheng County would die soon, so it was not worth executing him. This Xie Yiwu later became a governor, and he once submitted a memorial to the court recommending Wang Chong, saying, "Chong's talent is not due to learning; even Mencius and Xun Qing of previous generations, and Yang Xiong, Liu Xiang, and Sima Qian of the recent Han Dynasty, cannot surpass him," showing great admiration for Wang Chong.
      The "Book of the Later Han" has a simple record, and I do not know the details. But recently, I saw an article by Mr. He Lin, saying that in the history of philosophy, the relationship between materialists and idealists is often that of teachers, students, and friends. I think the Wang and Xie affair is also an example.
    To think that the fundamental views of materialism and the fundamental views of idealism—that is, two completely opposite views on the fundamental questions of philosophy—can be reconciled with each other, learning from and befriending each other, is untenable. But there is nothing strange about materialists and idealists being friends and teachers. Because many materialists and idealists, although opposed on fundamental viewpoints, will have common opinions on other philosophical questions; for example, the idea of dialectics can be held by both idealists and materialists. In terms of specific knowledge about nature, idealists and materialists also have common ground, and they can complement and enlighten each other. On practical political issues, idealists and materialists can also have a common stance. For example, Wang Chong, despite being the most steadfast materialist of his time, did not represent the revolutionary demands of the peasants; in "Lunheng," there are chapters such as "Xuan Han" and "Xu Song," which lavishly praise the Han Dynasty for "already having a sage emperor and governing peacefully," and he specifically stated: "It is not to flatter and praise because I was born in the Han Dynasty. It is to examine the facts and principles and determine the truth of the statements." Since he was not politically opposed, Xie Yiwu was not only able to tolerate his opposition to superstition but also praised his "genius." In today's terms, as long as an idealist supports socialism politically, isn't he a friend of the materialists? In history, we have even seen that people with different philosophical viewpoints and even different political views can still be friends simply because they respect each other's personal character—but of course, this is only possible within the same class. When the struggle between two opposing classes intensifies, there can be no such situation between idealists and materialists representing opposing classes.
    A few years ago, in a biological research institution, the Michurinians and the Morganists argued fiercely, almost to the point of antagonism. Later, after everyone reviewed the situation, they affirmed a principle: although they may be enemies in scientific viewpoints, they are friends in politics. Thus, "enemies in science, friends in politics" became a popular slogan for a time. This principle had a good effect. I don't understand biology, but I only know that the basic viewpoint of the Michurinians is indeed materialistic, and the Morganists?——If its fundamental viewpoint is truly idealistic, then on this point, it can indeed be said to be an enemy of the Michurinians, that is, there can be no compromise, let alone reconciliation. But this does not hinder them from being friends politically. Moreover, this political friendship is of great help in arriving at the truth of materialism through objective and sincere debate and ultimately becoming friends in scientific viewpoints as well.

    敌与友的关系
    徐选牲
    东汉的王充是力辟迷信的。但他有一个同乡朋友，叫做谢夷吾，是一位排在“后汉书”的“方术列传”里面的人，就是说，是一个弄迷信的人。有一次，谢夷吾奉上司之命，去治乌程县官的臧罪；他下县以后，什么也不动作，大哭一通，就回来了，弄得人莫名其妙。他回报上司道：他自己卜课的结果，知道乌程县官不久当死，所以不值得杀他。这个谢夷吾，后来官至刺史，他曾经向朝廷上书推荐王充，说“充之天才，非学所加，虽前世孟轲、孙卿，近汉杨雄、刘向、司马迁不能过也”，对王充佩服得很。
      “后汉书”的记载很简单，我不知其中的底细。但最近看到贺麟先生的文章，说在哲学史上唯物主义者和唯心主义者的关系，常常是师生朋友的关系。我想王、谢的事情，也是一例罢。
    以为唯物主义的根本观点和唯心主义的根本观点——即在哲学的根本问题上完全相反的两个观点，可以彼此融洽，相师相友，那是说不通的。但唯物主义者同唯心主义者之作为朋友师生，那并没有什么奇怪。因为不少的唯物主义者和唯心主义者，虽然在根本观点上是对立的，但就在哲学的其他问题上，是会有共同意见的；例如辩证法的思想，唯心主义者可以有，唯物主义者也可以有。在关于自然的具体知识方面，唯心主义者和唯物主义者也是共同的，彼此可以互相补充启发。在实际的政治问题上，唯心主义者和唯物主义者也会有共同的立场。例如王充，尽管是当时最坚定的唯物主义者，但他并没有代表农民要求的革命的主张；在“论衡”里，有“宣汉”“须颂”等篇，大讲其汉朝“已有圣帝，治已太平”，并特地声明：“非以身生汉世，可褒增颂叹，以求媚称也。核事理之情，定说者之实也”。在政治上并不敌对，所以谢夷吾不但能够容忍他的反对迷信，而且还推崇他的“天才”。以现在论，唯心主义者只要政治上拥护社会主义，还不是唯物主义者的朋友么？在历史上，我们甚至于看到不但哲学的基本观点不同，而且政治见解也不同的，却也可以只因为互相尊重私人品德而做朋友的——但自然，这是在同一阶级范围之内才行。在两个敌对的阶级的斗争尖锐化的时候，代表敌对的阶级的唯心主义者和唯物主义者之间，是不可能有这样的情况的。
    前几年，在一个研究生物学的机关里，米丘林主义者同摩尔根主义者论争得很激烈，几乎闹成对抗性的局面。后来大家检讨了一番，肯定了一条：在科学观点上尽管可以是敌人，在政治上却是朋友。于是“科学上的敌人，政治上的朋友”，一时成了一句口号。这一条是发生了好的效果的。我不懂生物学，只知道米丘林主义者的基本观点的确是唯物主义的，摩尔根主义者呢？——倘若它的根本观点真正是唯心主义的，那么，在这一点上，确实可以说是米丘林主义者的敌人，就是说，决不能妥协，更不能融洽的。但这并不妨害政治上作为朋友。而且，这政治上的朋友关系，对于经过客观的诚恳的论辩，最后共同归于唯物主义的真理，在科学观点上也成为朋友，是大有帮助的。
