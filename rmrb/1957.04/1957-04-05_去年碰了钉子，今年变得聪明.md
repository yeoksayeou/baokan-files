Last Year I Hit a Wall, This Year I'm Smarter
By Peng Xingyu, Director of Xinle Agricultural Cooperative

"Three days after the Winter Solstice is the New Year; you don't farm until after Qingming." This is an old rule passed down by our farmers for many years. But this year, we broke the precedent. Starting on the third day of the first lunar month, we started spring production one after another; before "Qingming," our cooperative's various production activities were already in full swing.

The first battle on this year's production front is to strive for a bumper harvest of small-grain crops (wheat, rapeseed, etc.). This has a significant effect on increasing grain production, accumulating funds for large-grain crops (mainly rice), and consolidating the sentiment of the cooperative members. After the start of spring, the 918 mu of wheat planted by the whole cooperative has been fertilized twice in general, and some have been top-dressed twice. Because we adopted the method of wide ridges and small ditches in the wheat fields, drainage is easy and management is convenient. Although there has been a lot of rain this year, there is very little water accumulation in the fields, and the wheat seedlings stretch their backs and raise their heads, green and lovely. The 354 mu of rapeseed fields in the whole cooperative have been fertilized with river silt twice and watered with manure twice. The newly planted Victory rapeseed is growing with green leaves and fat plants. As long as we manage it well this year, each mu can harvest 160 jin of rapeseed.

This year, the cooperative plans to plant double-cropping rice on an area of 495 mu. Each production team is currently soaking and germinating seeds, and the 55 mu of seedling fields have also been hoed. Some rice fields have already begun three plowing and four harrowing and will soon be flooded for sowing. The grass ash needed for the seedling fields and the fertilizer needed for the double-cropping early rice have all been prepared. All 78 draft cattle in the cooperative have safely survived the winter and have begun plowing the seedling fields.

The pumping station irrigation canal we built, which is four li long, was completed ahead of schedule on March 27.

People Wait for the Season

Why is this year's spring plowing production so well prepared? Last year's lessons helped us. The biggest lesson in production leadership last year was that preparations in all aspects were very hasty, and we rushed into the spring plowing production. For example, last year when planting double-cropping rice, we didn't go to the market to buy seeds until just before sowing; we sowed them without selection. As a result, the growth was uneven, and we harvested 200 jin less per mu. During the double-cropping early rice harvesting and late rice transplanting period, the labor force could not be adjusted, and the timing was delayed. The early rice was harvested too late to thresh, and then we encountered a big typhoon, which blew away a lot of rice and straw. We also lacked experience in production organization and management, which was very chaotic. Sometimes forty or fifty people gathered in one field, bumping into each other and stepping on each other's feet. It was like a lantern festival in the first lunar month. Our cadres were busy day and night without rest, but the work was still very passive.

This year we accepted this lesson. As soon as the Spring Festival was over, we discussed this year's production plan with the cooperative members and made comprehensive plans in production, finance, and labor according to the plan. Then, we listed all the preparations for spring plowing production, and each production team arranged the production schedule in stages and checked it regularly. Seeds, fertilizers, draft cattle, and farm tools were all planned in advance. We also selected the double-cropping rice fields and seedling fields one by one according to soil quality, distance, and other conditions. On March 29, a seedling field was sown as a demonstration. Before Qingming, all 55 seedling fields in the cooperative can be sown. This year, it is no longer the season urging people, but people waiting for the season.

This year, we determined the "three guarantees" indicators early and handed them over to each production team for discussion. We accepted the lessons of last year's excessively lenient contract labor and contract cost, and excessively high contract production targets. This year, the unit output of the whole cooperative is 625 jin, an increase of 3% over last year. This figure is more realistic and has played a positive role in boosting the production enthusiasm of the cooperative members. After the Xinmin Production Team contracted production, it increased the accumulation of 2,500 dan of natural fertilizer and improved 18 mu of soil, striving to exceed production and win awards this year.

In order to improve the quality of farm work this year, promote intensive cultivation and meticulous work, and increase the yield per unit area, we also tried out the field responsibility system in each production team, assigning responsibility fields to specific people and households, supervising the quality of the fields, and paying a certain amount of work points as remuneration for management. After this method was tried out, the cooperative members were all satisfied.

Rely on the Masses

The second lesson in leading production last year was that our cooperative cadres were too subjective and blindly optimistic. Major production decisions were not discussed with the masses, especially the opinions of the old farmers were ignored. Last year when planting double-cropping rice, we did not carefully consider the conditions of manpower, material resources, and season, but blindly implemented the district's decision, resulting in the waste of more than 11,000 jin of rice seeds. When planting double-cropping rice, the seedling fields were not yet ready, so we prematurely hoeed out all the red clover in the fields. Some old farmers strongly disagreed with this practice. I myself have farmed for forty years, and I was very skeptical, but I was afraid that people would say that I had conservative ideas, so I had to close my eyes and follow along. The direct cause of our subjectivism was that we consulted with the cooperative members too little. Last year, our cadres deployed work with "a task in one hand and a hat in the other." Whoever didn't accept the task was considered to have conservative ideas. Doing so, of course, increased the concerns of the masses. In addition, we did not participate in production, so we did not know when decisions were wrong, and the masses were unwilling to reflect, resulting in losses in production and alienation of the relationship between cadres and the masses.

We are determined to change this situation. We consult with the masses on all major decisions in the cooperative first. This year, we have held two meetings of cooperative member representatives to discuss production plans, three guarantees, building canals, and spring plowing production and other major issues of the whole cooperative. We have also held three symposiums with old farmers to study many issues in production technology. These symposiums gave us a lot of inspiration. Based on the suggestions of representatives and old farmers and the opinions of the masses, this year we reduced the planting area of double-cropping rice from 20% to 12.9%, so that it adapts to the labor situation and the season, ensures the quality of farm work, and increases the yield per unit area. The cooperative members also came up with many good ideas when studying this year's production plan. For example, everyone came up with the idea of shortening the length of the canal construction and utilizing open space, which saved 62 mu of land compared to the original plan, and also expanded the cultivated area by 7 mu; when studying dry land production, the masses suggested changing the two-crop land to three-crop land, which can increase income by 10,000 yuan compared to last year. Without the wisdom of the masses, we cadres would not have been able to think of these methods. Moreover, because we consulted with the masses on everything and promptly adopted their reasonable suggestions, the cooperative members' sense of being the masters of their own affairs and loving the cooperative as their home was also strengthened. This is why the cooperative members have such high production enthusiasm this year.

Last year, our cooperative cadres did not participate in production, which was also a major cause of subjectivism. This year, both I and Deputy Director Wang Shusheng took off our shoes and rolled up our trouser legs to go to the fields. Everyone worked with us, and their enthusiasm was even greater, and the sound of their voices became more cordial. We can also discover problems and solve them in a timely manner. Recently, I participated in the production of the Xinku Production Team and found that the rapeseed in 10 mu of rapeseed land was turning yellow, so I immediately discussed it with the production team leader. The next day, we applied 16,000 jin of pig manure, and the yellow leaves quickly turned green.

Diligence and Frugality

The lack of careful calculation in management, greed for more and bigger, and waste are also very important lessons. This year, we have firmly grasped the spirit of diligence and frugality in running the cooperative. In this year's actions, we first focused on the link of diligent and frugal preparation for plowing. We repaired old farm tools, used old materials to build eight cattle shed, and also made 300 sickles and 2,400 boards ourselves. This year, we don't need to purchase new farm tools, which can meet the needs of production. In fertilizer preparation, we also mainly accumulate natural fertilizer. This year, the farm cost per mu can be reduced from 12 yuan last year to 6.2 yuan.

Now, we feel that the biggest difficulty is the lack of funds. The total funds are still short of more than 6,000 yuan. We are carefully calculating from all aspects, increasing revenue and reducing expenditure, and relying on the support of all cooperative members. It is estimated that we can solve it.

If last year we were full of enthusiasm but lacked experience, this year we have become smarter and more prudent. The many lessons learned in last year's work will become favorable factors for us to lead production this year. Relying on the correct leadership of the Party and the active support of all cooperative members, we have a hundredfold confidence to strive for a bumper harvest this year!

    去年碰了钉子，今年变得聪明
    新乐农业社主任  彭兴余
    “三日冬至四日年，过了清明才下田”，这是我们农民多少年传下来的老规矩。可是，今年却破了例。农历正月初三那天起，我们就陆续开始搞春季生产了；“清明”还没有到，我们社里的各项生产活动已经是热火朝天了。
    今年生产战线上的头一仗，就是争取小熟（小麦、油菜等）丰收。这对于增产粮食、积累大熟（主要是水稻）资金、巩固社员情绪都有很大的作用。开春以后，全社种的九百一十八亩小麦，已经普遍施过两次肥，有些已追肥两次。因为在小麦田里采用了宽垅小沟的办法，排水容易，管理方便，今年雨水虽多，田里积水却很少，一撮撮麦苗都伸腰抬头，碧绿可爱。全社三百五十四亩油菜田，已经上过两次河泥，浇过两次粪。新种的胜利油菜长得叶绿棵肥。今年只要管理得好，每亩可收一百六十斤油菜籽是有。
    今年全社种植双季稻面积是四百九十五亩，各生产队正在浸种催芽，五十五亩秧苗田也已经锄好，有的稻田已开始三耕四耙，即将放水播种。秧苗田所需用的草灰，双季早稻要用的肥料，都已经准备停当。全社七十八条耕牛，也都安全渡过寒冬，开始耕秧田。
    我们修筑的抽水机灌溉渠道，有四里路长，已经在3月27日提前完成。
    人等季节
    为什么今年的春耕生产准备得这样充分？去年的教训帮助了我们。去年生产领导上最大的教训是各方面的准备都很草率，就仓促投入了春耕大生产。如去年种双季稻，直到临播种的时候才去市场上买种籽；没有经过选择，就播了下去。结果生长不齐，每亩就少收二百斤。在双季稻早稻抢收和晚稻插秧期间，劳动力调剂不过来，又耽误了时节。前期稻收上来来不及打，又遇一场大台风，稻谷稻草吹掉不少。在生产组织管理上，我们也没有经验，弄得很乱，有时候一块田里聚了四、五十人，人碰人，脚踩脚，简直赛过正月里串花灯。我们干部忙得日夜不得休息，工作仍然很被动。
    今年我们接受了这个教训。春节一过，我们就和社员一起讨论了今年的生产计划，根据计划在生产、财务、劳动力三方面都进行了全面的规划。接着，就把春耕生产的各项准备工作都排出来，各生产队再分期分段排好生产进度，定期进行检查。种子、肥料、耕牛、农具都事先作好计划。种双季稻的田和秧苗田，我们也根据土质、距离等条件一块块作了选择。3月29日，有一块秧苗田先播种示范。到清明前，全社五十五块秧苗田就可以播种完毕。今年再不是季节催人，而是人等季节了。
    今年我们及早确定了“三包”指标，交给各生产队讨论。我们接受了去年包工、包本偏宽、包产指标偏高的教训，今年全社单位产量是六百二十五斤，比去年增加3％。这数字比较符合实际，对鼓舞社员的生产情绪也起了积极作用。新民生产队包产后，就增积自然肥料二千五百担，改良土壤十八亩，争取今年超产得奖。
    为了提高今年农活的质量，提倡精耕细作，提高单位面积产量，我们又在各生产队试行了田间责任制，定人定户划定责任田，监督田间质量，负责管理的拨发一定的工分报酬。这办法试行后，社员都满意。
    依靠群众
    去年领导生产上的第二个教训是我们社干部的主观主义盲目性太大，决定生产上的重大问题都没有同群众商量；特别是忽视了老农的意见。去年种双季稻，没有周密地考虑人力、物力和季节等方面的条件，只是盲目地执行区里的决定，结果浪费了一万一千多斤稻种。在种双季稻时，秧苗田还没有做好，就过早地把田里的红花草统统锄掉，有些老农很不同意这种做法，我自己也种了四十年田，心里很怀疑，但又怕人说我有保守思想，也只好闭起眼睛跟着跑。造成我们主观主义的直接原因是我们同社员商量得太少。去年我们干部布置工作是“一只手任务，一只手帽子”，谁要不接受任务，就是保守思想。这样做，当然就增加了群众的顾虑。再加上我们不参加生产，决定错了自己不知道，群众又不愿反映，结果生产受到了损失，干群关系也疏远了。
    我们决心改变这种情况，凡是决定社里的重大事情都先找群众商量。今年我们已开过两次社员代表大会，讨论了生产计划、三包、筑渠道和春耕生产等全社性的重大问题。我们又开过三次老农座谈会，研究生产技术上许多问题。这几次座谈会，给了我们很大启发。根据代表和老农的建议和群众的意见，今年我们把双季稻的种植面积从20％减少到12.9％，使它同劳力状况和季节相适应，保证农活的质量，提高单位产量。社员在研究今年的生产计划时，还出了不少的好主意。如大家出主意研究缩短筑渠道的路程，利用空地，就比原计划节约六十二亩土地，而且还扩大了耕地面积七亩；在研究旱地生产时，群众建议把二熟地改为三熟地，这样可比去年增加一万元收入。这些办法要不是发挥群众的智慧，凭我们几个干部是想不出来的。而且因为事事和群众商量，及时采纳了他们合理的建议，社员当家做主爱社如家的思想也加强了。社员们今年生产情绪这样高，道理就在这里。
    去年我们社干部不参加生产，也是犯主观主义毛病的一个大原因。今年我和副主任王树生都脱掉鞋子卷起裤管下田去了。大家和我们在一起干活，劲头更加足，说话的声音也变得更亲切了。我们也可以及时发现问题，解决问题了。最近我参加新库生产队的生产，发现有十亩油菜地的油菜发黄，就立即找生产队长商量，第二天便追了一万六千斤猪肥，发黄的叶子很快就转青了。
    克勤克俭
    经营管理上缺乏精打细算，贪多图大，造成浪费，这也是一个很重要的教训。今年我们紧紧掌握了勤俭办社的精神，在今年的行动中，首先抓紧了勤俭备耕这一环。我们修补了旧农具，利用旧器材搭好八个牛车棚，还自制了槤头三百个板子二千四百张。今年不需要添购新农具，就可满足生产需要。在肥料准备上，我们也以增积自然肥料为主。今年每亩田农本可以从去年的十二元降低到六元二角。
    现在我们感到最大的困难是资金缺乏。全年资金还缺少六千多元，我们正从各方面精打细算，开源节流，依靠全体社员的支持，估计是能够解决的。
    假使说，去年我们是热情有余、经验不足，今年我们就变得聪明些稳重些了。去年工作上得到的许多教训，都会变成我们今年领导生产的有利因素，依靠党的正确领导和全体社员的积极支持，我们有百倍的信心来争取今年的大丰收！
