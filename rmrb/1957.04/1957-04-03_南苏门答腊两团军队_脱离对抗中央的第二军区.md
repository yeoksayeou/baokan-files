Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 1st: According to a report in today's "People's Daily" in Jakarta, the 5th and 6th Regiments of the Army stationed in South Sumatra have declared their secession from the Second Military Region and are now in direct contact with the Army Headquarters.

According to Antara News Agency, authoritative sources in Palembang believe that some officers declared their secession from the Second Military Region because they could not agree with Lieutenant Colonel Barlian, commander of the Second Military Region, for changing the government organization "for the benefit of certain groups." Furthermore, it was also because Barlian did not comply with the decisions of the Military Region Commanders' Conference and refused to transfer some officers, thus violating the order of the Supreme Commander.

Newspaper reports state that Barlian's seizure of power in South Sumatra on March 9 was strongly opposed by the commander of the 5th Regiment and others. The 5th Regiment and "Battalion A" are both stationed in the Palembang area.

Newspaper reports say that the situation in Palembang is currently very tense. On the night of March 30, Barlian ordered the arrest of a large number of personnel working in the government and the army, almost leading to armed conflict between those executing the order and those who disagreed with it. A curfew has been imposed in Palembang.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 2nd: The Indonesian Army Intelligence Department confirmed today that Army Chief of Staff Major General Nasution has traveled from Central Sumatra to Palembang to handle the incidents occurring in the Second Military Region.

Palembang Radio broadcast yesterday that Lieutenant Colonel Barlian, commander of the Second Military Region, had dismissed Major R.H. Djuhartono, commander of the 5th Regiment. Djuhartono had earlier announced his secession from the Second Military Region and direct contact with the Army Headquarters.

The "People's Daily" in Jakarta stated that the fact that two regiments of the Second Military Region had broken away from Barlian shows that the act of betrayal against the central government that occurred not long ago was launched solely by force of arms and did not receive the support of the people and the troops.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 2nd: The Indonesian Army Intelligence Department announced today that Major R.H. Djuhartono, commander of the 5th Regiment, and Lieutenant Colonel Warouw, commander of the 6th Regiment, have submitted reports to the Army Chief of Staff on the Palembang incident and related issues. Lieutenant Colonel Barlian, commander of the Second Military Region, has also reported the incident to the Army Chief of Staff. Both sides have agreed to hand the matter over to the Army Chief of Staff for handling.

    南苏门答腊两团军队
    脱离对抗中央的第二军区
    据新华社雅加达1日电　据雅加达“人民日报”今天报道，驻在南苏门答腊的陆军第五团和第六团已经声明脱离第二军区而直接同陆军总部联系。
    据安塔拉通讯社报道，巨港的权威人士认为，有一些军官宣告脱离第二军区，因为他们不能同意第二军区司令巴利安中校“为了某些集团的利益”而改变政府组织的行为。此外，也因为巴利安不遵守军区司令会议的决定，拒绝调动一些军官，因此违背了最高统帅的命令。
    报纸消息说，巴利安在3月9日夺取南苏门答腊政权的行为，曾经遭到第五团团长等人的激烈反对。第五团和“甲”营都驻在巨港地区。
    据报纸消息说，目前巨港局势很紧张。巴利安在3月30日半夜命令逮捕大批在政府和军队中工作的人员，几乎引起执行命令和不同意命令的人之间的武装冲突。巨港已经实行宵禁。
    据新华社雅加达2日电　印度尼西亚陆军情报处今天证实，陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安少将已经从中苏门答腊到巨港去处理第二军区发生的事件。
    巨港电台昨天广播说，第二军区司令巴利安中校已经将第五团团长儒哈托诺少校免职。儒哈托诺在早些时候宣布脱离第二军区而直接同陆军总部联系。
    雅加达“人民日报”说，第二军区两个团脱离巴利安的事实说明，不久以前发生的背叛中央的行为是只靠枪杆发动的，它没有得到人民和部队的支持。
    新华社雅加达2日电　印度尼西亚陆军情报处今天宣布，陆军第五团团长儒哈托诺少校和第六团团长沃朗中校已经就巨港事件和有关问题向陆军参谋长提出报告。第二军区司令巴利安中校也已经向陆军参谋长报告了事件经过。双方都同意把问题交给陆军参谋长去处理。
