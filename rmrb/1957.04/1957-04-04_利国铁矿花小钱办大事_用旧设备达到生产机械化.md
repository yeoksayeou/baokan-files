Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing - The state-owned Liguo Iron Mine has achieved production mechanization by utilizing purchased, dilapidated equipment. Currently, the mine's drilling operations have reached a 98% mechanization rate, and the hoisting of mined materials is fully mechanized.

When the Liguo Iron Mine resumed production in 1949, all operations were manual. Because it was said that the mine had already been developed during the Han Dynasty, people jokingly referred to the manual production at the time as the "Cao Cao era" mining method.

In order to mechanize production, the CCP Party organization and administrative leaders of the Liguo Iron Mine, in the spirit of "achieving great things with little money," sent people to steel enterprises in various regions every year to search for and purchase old equipment. Currently, all eight small steam locomotives used by the mine were restored from discarded items, and six of these locomotives were bought as scrap iron. Thirteen of the twenty-three winches used in various mining areas are old. After being repaired, the old winches have taken on the task of hoisting mined materials in various mining areas. Due to the gradual increase in the degree of mechanization, the mine's labor productivity and output have significantly increased. The output of iron ore in 1956 was three times that of 1950.

All the buildings in the Liguo Iron Mine were also built using the most economical methods. Dormitories and offices use stones quarried from the mountains as walls, and some houses have brick cavity walls. The cost of building the houses is low, averaging less than thirty-five yuan per square meter.

### 利国铁矿花小钱办大事  用旧设备达到生产机械化

    利国铁矿花小钱办大事
    用旧设备达到生产机械化
    据新华社南京电　国营利国铁矿利用收购的破旧设备使生产达到了机械化。现在，这个矿凿岩工作的机械化程度已经达到98％，采掘物提升已经完全机械化。
    利国铁矿在1949年恢复生产的时候，全部是手工生产。因为这个矿相传在汉朝就已经开发，所以人们把当时手工生产戏称为“曹操时代式”的开采方法。
    利国铁矿的中共党组织和行政领导干部，为使生产机械化，本着“花小钱办大事”的精神，每年派人到各地钢铁企业搜集、采购旧设备。目前，这个矿所用的八部蒸汽小机车，都是废品修复的，其中六部机车是当废铁买进的。各矿场所用的二十三部卷扬机中有十三部是旧的。旧的卷扬机修复以后已经分别担负起各矿场采掘物的提升工作。由于机械化程度的逐年提高，这个矿的劳动生产率和产量有了显著增长，1956年铁矿石产量等于1950年的三倍。
    利国铁矿所有的建筑物也都是用最节约的方法建造的。宿舍和办公室都是用从山上采下的石头作墙，有的房屋是砖砌的空心墙。房屋造价低廉，平均每平方公尺不到三十五元。
