Xinhua News Agency, Huangling, April 6th. Yesterday, on Qingming Festival, more than 3,000 representatives from all circles in Huangling County, Shaanxi Province, ascended Qiao Mountain to pay respects at the mausoleum of the Yellow Emperor, the ancestor of the Han people.

The memorial ceremony began at 9:30 AM. After the band played the national anthem, Yang Yuting, the Vice Governor of Shaanxi Province, as the chief officiant, offered incense, wine, and wreaths in front of the Yellow Emperor's Mausoleum. He also told the masses about the Yellow Emperor's achievements in establishing the foundation of the nation, developing production, and culture. He called on the masses to inherit the Yellow Emperor's spirit of diligence and bravery, and to work hard to build the motherland. The participants then circled the mausoleum once before descending the mountain to visit the Xuanyuan Temple.

According to local mythology, when the Yellow Emperor "ascended to heaven on a dragon," the people, cherishing his merits and reluctant to part, grabbed at his clothing to try to keep him. At that time, a piece of his robe and one of his boots were torn off and buried on Qiao Mountain. This is the origin of the Yellow Emperor's Mausoleum.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, April 6th. More than twenty former Kuomintang military and political figures residing in Hangzhou paid respects at the tombs of Yue Fei and others by West Lake on Qingming Festival, and presented wreaths to pay tribute at the tombs.

Ma Wenche, who served as the Secretary-General of Chiang Kai-shek's Headquarters during the Northern Expedition, wrote four poems to commemorate the occasion before sweeping the tomb. Among those who participated in the tomb sweeping were Xiang Xiongxiao, who served as the Director of the General Affairs Office of the Ministry of Military Administration when He Yingqin was the Minister of Military Administration; Zhang Zongxiang, a former Qing Dynasty scholar and former Director of the Education Department of Zhejiang Province under the Kuomintang; Shi Zhaoguang, who went to Taiwan to participate in acceptance work when Japan surrendered; Du Wei, former Director of the Kuomintang Civil Affairs Department; Zhang Hongchun, who participated in the Xinhai Revolution and served as the principal and education director of the Kuomintang Cavalry School; and uprising generals Liu Haibo, Liu Jinchi, Sun Mingquan, and He Zhibin.

They swept and paid tribute to the tomb of the national hero Yue Fei, the tomb of Zhang Cangshui, who fought against the Qing Dynasty for twenty years and died heroically at the time of the Ming Dynasty's demise, the tomb of the revolutionary martyr Qiu Jin, who died during the Xinhai Revolution, and the tomb of the fallen soldiers who captured Jinling (Nanjing) during the Xinhai Revolution.

    在杭州的前国民党军政人员扫岳飞墓
    新华社黄陵6日电　昨天清明节，陕西省黄陵县各界代表三千多人登上桥山祭扫了汉族的祖先轩辕黄帝的陵墓。
    上午九时半祭陵仪式开始。乐队奏国歌后，主祭人、陕西省副省长杨玉亭在黄帝陵前上香献爵、献花圈，并向群众讲述轩辕黄帝开创民族基业，发展生产和文化的功迹。他号召群众继承轩辕黄帝勤劳勇敢的精神，艰苦奋斗建设祖国。祭陵人最后绕陵一周，然后下山参观轩辕庙。
    据当地相传的神话，当黄帝“骑龙升天”的时候，人民怀念他的功勋，恋恋不舍，牵衣挽留，当时扯下了他的一块袍襟和一只靴子，便埋葬在桥山上。这就是黄帝陵的来源。
