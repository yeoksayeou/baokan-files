Newly Discovered Cultural Relics

    Mid-Pleistocene Epoch Biological Fossils

    Following the discovery of mid-Pleistocene human fossils in Zhongjiawan, Huangjiatang Township, Zhaojiayan District, Changyang County, Hubei Province, another human second left premolar, as well as fossils of more than ten species of vertebrates, including the Chinese rhinoceros, saber-toothed elephant, tapir, deer, porcupine, tiger, leopard, bear, hyena, and badger, were recently discovered there. These fossils have been proven to be comparable to animal fossils discovered in Sichuan and Guangxi, dating back to approximately the mid-Pleistocene Epoch, similar to the Peking Man found in Zhoukoudian near Beijing. This discovery adds new data to the study of human evolution.

    Glazed Pottery from the Han Dynasty

    The Jiangsu Provincial Cultural Relics Survey Team recently identified a batch of newly unearthed glazed pottery at the Changzhou Mechanism Brick and Tile Factory outside the West Gate of Changzhou City, including pottery pots, pottery *fou*, pottery *fang*, and pottery *ding*. This batch of glazed pottery was unearthed by the factory during land excavation.

    These glazed pottery pieces are engraved with water wave patterns and animal mask designs. They are products of the mid-Western Han Dynasty and Eastern Han Dynasty, dating back approximately two thousand years. The pottery *fou* was a container for food, while the pottery pots and pottery *fang* were containers for wine. The large-scale excavation of this batch of glazed pottery indicates that this area is a Han tomb complex, and Changzhou City is a cultural city with a long history. (Pan Yongchang)

    Three Early Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Iron Cannons

    The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Memorial Hall and the Nanjing Municipal Cultural Relics Preservation Committee recently discovered three early Taiping Heavenly Kingdom iron cannons in the Hefei City and Feixi County area of Anhui Province.

    One discovered at the Feixi County Pumping Station has a cannon body inscribed with twenty characters: "Made in the sixth year of Bingchen of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom (1856), weighing two hundred and eighteen *jin*, twelve *ren* of powder (gunpowder)." This iron cannon is relatively small, finely cast, and has very precise weight specifications, which are its greatest characteristics and a first discovery domestically. In addition, the complete inscription of the national title, year, weight, and amount of gunpowder on the cannon body is also rare among the discovered Taiping Heavenly Kingdom iron cannons. The two iron cannons discovered in Sanhe Town, Feixi County, and Hefei City were both heavy weapons cast by the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom in Anhui Province, and they both originated in Sanhe. The former weighs 722 *jin*, and the inscription reads: "Taiping Holy Cannon, made in Anhui Province in the fifth year of Yimao (1855)." This was cast in the third year after the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom established its capital in Tianjing, dating back one hundred and two years. Its early casting date is the first discovery among the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom copper and iron cannons discovered nationwide, making it particularly valuable. The one at the Xinsheng Iron Factory in Hefei City is also a valuable cultural relic from about a hundred years ago. (Jin Chengqian)

    Cultural Site from the Han to the Six Dynasties Period

    The Shaojiagou in Gaoyou County, Jiangsu Province, recently discovered ancient residential remains during the spring renovation of the canal during the soil excavation project. Shaojiagou is a place next to the east bank of the canal. According to preliminary findings, this is a cultural site from the Han to the Six Dynasties period. Currently, a complete Han Dynasty round-bottom pottery jar has been discovered in the No. 3 ash pit, with ropes threaded on the ears on both sides. A pottery pot with fifty-three small seal characters written in red has also been discovered in the same ash pit, as well as several large characters. Four ancient residential wells have also been discovered in Shaojiagou and its vicinity. The structure of the well consists of three sections of pottery well rings. Some of the well rings are composed of two half-rings, while others are complete rings. There are four round holes on each well ring. There are three types of well bottoms: some are earthen bottoms, some are brick bottoms, and some are bottoms made of two wooden planks. In addition, many celadon wares, lacquerwares, plowshares, pottery weights for fishing nets, various forms of spinning wheels, bamboo woven rice washing baskets, reed mats, yellow grass woven fabrics, iron hammers, etc., have also been discovered here.

    新发现的文物
    更新世中期生物化石
    湖北省长阳县赵家堰区黄家塘乡钟家湾发现更新世中期人类化石以后，最近又在那里发现人类第二左前臼齿一枚，以及中国犀、剑齿象、貘、鹿、箭猪、虎、豹、熊、鬣狗和獾等十多种脊椎动物的化石。这些化石，经证明是同四川和广西等地发现的动物化石相当，时代约同属于更新世中期的北京附近周口店中国猿人相近。这一发现给研究人类发展史增加了新的资料。
    汉代的釉陶器
    江苏省文物普查小组最近在常州市西门外常州机制砖瓦厂鉴定了一批新出土的釉陶器，其中有陶壶、陶瓿、陶钫和陶鼎等。这批釉陶器是这个厂在翻土中掘出来的。
    这些釉陶器上刻有水浪形花纹和兽面图案。它们是西汉中叶和东汉年间的产物，距今已有二千年左右。陶瓿是盛食物的器具，陶壶和陶钫是盛酒的器具。这批釉陶器的大量出土说明，这个地区是汉墓群，常州市是一个历史悠久的文化城市。　（潘永昌）
    三尊太平天国早期的铁炮
    太平天国纪念馆和南京市文物保管委员会，最近在安徽省合肥市和肥西县一带连续发现三尊太平天国早期的铁炮。
    肥西县抽水机站发现的一尊，炮身铸有：“太平天国丙辰六年（1856）置造、重二百十八斤、粉（火药）十二刃”二十字铭文。这尊铁炮体积较小，铸造精良，重量规格十分精确，都是它的最大特点，是国内第一次发现。另外，在炮身铸有国号、年代、重量和火药数量这样完整的款格，在已发现的太平天国铁炮中，也是罕见的。在肥西县三河镇和合肥市发现的两尊铁炮，都是太平天国在安徽省铸造的重武器，也都是源出三河一地的。前者计重七百二十二市斤，铭文是：“太平圣炮、乙卯五年（1855）安徽省造”。这是太平天国定都天京后第三年铸造的，距今已有一百零二年的历史了。其铸造年代之早，在全国已发现的太平天国铜铁炮中，这是第一次发现，格外珍贵。合肥市新生铁工厂的那一尊，也是约百年前的珍贵文物。

    汉至六朝时代的文化遗址
    江苏省高邮县的邵家沟最近在运河春修挖土工程中，发现了古代居民遗迹。邵家沟是运河东堤旁边的一个地方。根据初步发现的迹象判断，这里是汉至六朝时代的文化遗址。目前在第三号灰坑内已发现一个完好的汉代圆底陶罐，两旁耳子上有绳子穿在上面。在同一灰坑内又发现一个陶壶，上有朱写的小的篆体字五十三个，另外还有几个大字。邵家沟及其附近还发现了四口古代居民用的水井。井的构造是一共有三节陶井圈。井圈有的是两个半圈合成的，有的是整圈。每个井圈上有四个圆孔。井底有三种，有的是土底，有的是砖砌的底，有的是两块木板拼成的底。另外，这里还发现了许多青瓷器、漆器、犁铧、渔网上的陶坠、各种形式的纺轮、竹编淘米箩、蒲编的席子、黄草编织物、铁锤等。　（据新华社讯）
