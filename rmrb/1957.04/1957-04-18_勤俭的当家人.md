    The Diligent and Thrifty Head of the Household
    Ou Rishu
    The train pulled into Shanhaiguan Station and stopped. Passengers jumped down from the carriages one after another, crowding toward the station exit, lining up in a long queue, waiting to leave the station. Standing in front of me in the line was a middle-aged woman, short hair, wearing a Zhongshan suit, with bound feet, carrying a large package of new cloth shoes on her shoulder, looking like she was delivering goods somewhere. She occasionally turned her head, and a familiar face immediately flashed through my mind. I searched my memory diligently: where had I seen this simple face before?

    We exited the station and happened to be going the same way. I thought she would definitely take a vehicle, but unexpectedly, she didn't. Carrying the large bundle on her back, she walked straight ahead, looking very labored, but she walked with a determined gait.

    I couldn't help but ask Old Wang, who was with me, "Do you recognize this woman? She looks very familiar." Old Wang smiled mysteriously and said smugly, "Isn't this Chen Mingsu, the director of the Qinhuangdao City March 8th Women's Shoe-Making Cooperative? Their cooperative is under our leadership, and I know her very well."

    "How come the cooperative director is carrying shoes? What is she doing!"

    "That's a long story! She is a well-known figure in our city for running the cooperative with diligence and thrift. She's on her way to deliver goods to the ordering unit. This is a regular occurrence. Look at her carrying such a large package on her back, not even taking a vehicle. No wonder everyone always calls her 'money-grubber,' but I say she's saving money."

    Because we were going home for the weekend and weren't in a hurry, I slowed down and pressed Old Wang for all the details.

    "So, she has quite a background!"

    "Of course," Old Wang explained. "From the beginning of 1955, she led dozens of housewives in engaging in shoe-making as a side occupation. In April, they formed a cooperative, and she was elected director, but they had no funds at all. The government lent them 300 yuan. They bought a stitching machine and some tools and materials, and found two rooms. Tables, chairs, benches, kettles, and bowls were all borrowed. They simply started the cooperative like that. At that time, the products were simple, sales were poor, and the lives of the members were difficult, to say the least! But after more than two years of hard work, they now have more than 3,000 yuan in funds, two stitching machines, and have purchased desks and enough tools and shoe lasts. The members' wages have increased from a few yuan in the past to about forty yuan now."

    "That's really not simple! How did they get through it so arduously!"

    "Telling the whole process would be too long. Take Director Chen Mingsu, for example. She tackles the work head-on. Leading the members' thinking, contacting businesses, purchasing, delivering, and picking up goods... she does everything. Whenever she has free time, she also participates in production. She cherishes every thread and needle in the cooperative. She is meticulous about every piece of paper and drop of ink. In the beginning, she even made her own fountain pen ink. When the cooperative's business was not doing well, she took the initiative to ask to lower her own salary to reduce expenses. When product sales encountered difficulties, she carried the products to the market or set up a stall on the street to promote sales."

    I asked Old Wang, "What is her background?"

    "I'm not too clear about that. I only know that she used to be a housewife and is uneducated, but she is an old Communist Party member! I heard that she used to be the director of the Women's Salvation Association in the old liberated areas."

    It was a coincidence that when we returned to Qinhuangdao at night, we were sitting together on the train again. I carefully scrutinized her face, wanting to find a bit of extraordinary temperament on it. She still had a simple, firm, ordinary face. I thought to myself, "Don't look down on people; she is an excellent leader! It's true that 'you can't judge a book by its cover!'" We chatted casually, from simple greetings to the night scenery outside the window, to this year's production increase and conservation, and then to each other's families. Later, I asked her, "Where does your husband work?" She sized me up for a moment before saying, "He's the director of the Jianguo Timber Cooperative in the city." I almost exclaimed, "Oh! So you are Old Hu's wife! I'm very familiar with him; I often deal with him. The cooperative he leads is also a model of democratic cooperative management in the city! You two are a perfect match, two directors, a pair of models." After saying that, we both laughed loudly, and the laughter filled the entire carriage.

    When we parted, I jokingly said to her, "Goodbye! Diligent and thrifty head of the household!"

    勤俭的当家人
    欧日枢
    火车开进山海关车站，停下了。旅客们纷纷由车厢里跳下来，涌到车站的出口处，排成一字长蛇，等待出站。排在我前面的是一个中年妇女，短发、中山装，一双小脚，肩上背着一大包新布鞋，看样子是给哪儿送货的。她偶尔一回头，一个熟悉的面孔立刻闪过我的脑海，我在记忆里努力地搜寻：是在哪儿见过这张朴实的面孔来着呢？
    我们出站了，正巧又走同路。我想她一定会坐车的，但出乎意外，她没有坐。背着大包袱径直向前走去，看样子很吃力，但她一扭一扭地走得却很带劲。
    我不禁问了一声和我一道来的老王；“你认识这个妇女吗？好像很面熟。”老王迷迷一笑，得意地说：“这不是咱秦皇岛市三八妇女制鞋社的主任陈明素吗？她们的社正归我们领导，我对她最了解。”
    “社主任怎么背起鞋来啦？她这是干嘛去呀！”
    “说起来话就长啦！她呀，是咱市里有名的勤俭办社的人物，她这是往订货单位送货去。这是常事，你看她背这一大包，连车都不坐，怪不得大家老说她‘财迷’，可我说人家这是节约。”
    因为我们是回家过星期天，心里没急事，我索性放慢了脚步，跟老王来了个打破砂锅问到底。
    “这么说，她是很有来历的喽！”
    “当然。”老王解释说，从1955年初起，那时她领导着几十名家庭妇女搞制鞋副业，4月她们组成了合作社，她当选了主任，但是一点资金都没有。政府借给了她们三百元。她们买了一台扎口机和一些工具、材料，又找了两间房子，桌椅板凳、壶碗家什都是借来的。就这样简简单单地她们真把社搞起来了，当时产品单纯、销路不畅、社员生活困难，那就甭提啦！但经过两年多的难苦奋斗，现在已拥有基金三千多元，扎帮机器两台，并且置备了办公桌和足够的工具和鞋楦了，社员的工资收入由过去的几元增到四十来元啦。”
    “这可真不简单哪！她们到底是怎么艰苦地过来的呀！”
    “说这过程可太啰嗦。就拿主任陈明素来说，工作连踢带打，社员思想领导啦，联系业务啦，采买、送货取货啦……什么都干。一有空儿她还参加生产。她对社里的一针一线，都爱护备至。一纸一墨，都要精打细算，开始的时候，连钢笔水她都自己泡制，社里营业不好的时候，她主动请求降低自己的工资，减少开支。产品销路发生困难的时候，她背起产品去赶集或者到街头摆摊推销。”
    我问老王：“她是什么出身？”
    “这个我可不太清楚。只知道她过去是家庭妇女，没有文化，但她是老共产党员啦！听说从前在老解放区当过妇救会主任。”
    真凑巧，晚上回秦皇岛的时候，我们在上车又是坐在一起。我仔细地端详着她的脸，想从上面找出一点不平凡的气质。她还是一张淳朴、坚定、平常的脸，我心想：“别看人不起眼，人家可是个出色的领导者呢？真是‘人不可貌相’啊！”我们闲谈起来，从简单的寒喧，谈到窗外的夜景，谈到今年的增产节约，又谈到各人的家庭，后来我问她：“您爱人在哪儿工作？”她打量了我一下，才说：“在市里建国木业社当主任。”我差点惊叫了起来：“噢！原来您是老胡的爱人呀！我跟他特别熟，时常跟他打交道，他领导的社还是市里民主办社的典型咧！你们这两口子可真相配，两个主任，一双模范。”说完，我们都大笑起来，笑声充满了整个车厢。
    分手的时候，我打趣地对她说：“再见吧！勤俭的当家人！”
