Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, April 1st: As the spring breeze just blew into the Junggar Basin, a reservoir on the west bank of the Manas River in the Xiaoguai area, intended to supply water to the Karamay oilfield, has entered a stage of intense construction.

The reservoir builders are striving to complete this small reservoir before the Manas River thaws, so that the spring floods after thawing can be stored in the reservoir.

In order to guarantee the water needs of the Karamay oil area, the long-distance water pipeline, which has been partially completed, will draw a large amount of water from the Manas River to Karamay. After the Xiaoguai Reservoir is completed, the water pipeline can supply water to the oil area continuously, just as it does normally, during the dry season of the Manas River.

    为克拉玛依兴建水库
    据新华社乌鲁木齐1日电　春风刚吹到准噶尔盆地，玛纳斯河西岸小拐地区为供应克拉玛依油区用水的一座水库已经进入紧张的施工阶段。
    水库建设者争取在玛纳斯河解冻以前把这座小型水库修好，让解冻以后的春洪蓄进水库。
    为保证克拉玛依油区用水的需要，已经部分完工的长距离输水管线将把玛纳斯河水大量引到克拉玛依。小拐水库修成以后，在玛纳斯河枯水季节里，输水管线也能同平时一样源源不绝地供应油区用水。
