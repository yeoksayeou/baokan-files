A Brief History of Guangxi
邓锐龄
Three

Regarding the origins of the Zhuang people, there are generally two views: one is that the Zhuang migrated to Guangxi from elsewhere, and the other is that the Zhuang are indigenous to Guangxi. In recent times, Xu Songshi used the Zhuang language origins of many place names in Guangdong and Guangxi to prove that the Zhuang people are indigenous to Lingnan and pointed out that they are descendants of the ancient Yue people. Luo Xianglin, based on geographical distribution, speculated that the ancient "Xi Ou" or part of the "Luo Yue" people are the ancestors of today's Zhuang people. Fei Xiaotong believes that the Zhuang people call themselves "Buyue Yi," and "Yue Yi" is a transliteration of "Yu Yue." Based on the language system, he infers that the Zhuang are descendants of a branch of the ancient Yue people (Note 13). Relatively speaking, the latter view can be considered for adoption, but because the issue of origin is the most complex issue in the history of ethnic minorities, this view requires further research and confirmation. The Zhuang people may be descendants of several tribes of the ancient Yue people, who settled in Lingnan since ancient times. The process of racial mixing and tribal migration over thousands of years is untraceable, but a large portion of the Zhuang people's ancestors may have gradually become the Han people of Guangdong and Guangxi due to intermarriage and cohabitation with the Han, and this trend has almost always been ongoing.

The Huang and Nong clans, who lived in western Guangxi during the Tang and Song dynasties, were also very likely to belong to the Zhuang people. Geographically, the Huang, Nong, and other tribes lived in the present-day Yishan area and the former Yongning Special District, and these two regions are still Zhuang settlements today. Huang is still a major surname among the Zhuang people. The "Malan" dwellings of the Huang and Nong people mentioned in Song Dynasty records are still a common form of housing for the Zhuang people today (Note 14).

Before the Southern Song Dynasty, the Han people did not have a definite name for the Zhuang people. In addition to the "Yue" character used in ancient times, they were generally referred to as "Man" and "Liao" after the Six Dynasties. "Man" and "Liao" were generic terms for different ethnic groups in the Yangtze and Yue River basins at that time, similar to our general term "foreigners" for foreigners in the last century. The character "Zhuang" began to appear in records in the Southern Song Dynasty, and it was officially seen in officials' reports, but its use was extremely uncommon (Note 15). It was not until the memorials of the Ming Dynasty that the character "Zhuang" appeared many times, and it was often mentioned together with "Yao," with "Zhuang and Yao" representing all ethnic minorities in Guangxi.

Why was the character "Zhuang" used so late? I think that just as many ethnic minorities did not conceptually summarize several tribes into a unified name for a long time, it also took a long time for the Han people to determine a general term. At the same time, this is related to the increasing number of Han intellectuals entering Guangxi since the Southern Song Dynasty and their increasingly in-depth understanding of the local ethnic groups. In addition, in the Yuan Dynasty, a large number of Zhuang people migrated from northwestern Guangxi (present-day Qingyuan, Nandan, and further west in the Yishan area). These Zhuang people were part of a tribe named "Zhuang," and after migrating, they were widely dispersed and lived among the Han people, thus giving the Han people a deep impression. Perhaps from that time on, the extension of the concept of Zhuang became wider and wider, and it was finally used as a common name that could summarize several tribes (Note 16). Zhuang should be pronounced as "Zhuang." The Zhuang people in the Liuzhou area of Guangxi still call themselves "Bu Zhuang."

During the Tang Dynasty, the Huang clan was the strongest among the Zhuang tribes. Besides the Huang clan, there were also the Ning, Wei, Zhou, Nong, and other tribes, all distributed in the present-day Zuojiang and Youjiang River basins. After the Huang clan failed, the Nong clan allied with Nanzhao and became the most powerful. During the Northern Song Dynasty, Nong Zhigao launched an uprising, calling himself Emperor Renhui, establishing official positions, employing Han intellectuals, capturing Yongzhou (present-day Nanning), and besieging Guangzhou. A year after the uprising, he was defeated by Song general Di Qing. Nong Zhigao fled to Dali, and his whereabouts are unknown. The Zhuang people in the Du'an area of present-day Baise call themselves Bu Nong, and they should be descendants of the Nong clan.

During the Tang Dynasty, many Juejimi prefectures and counties were established in Guangxi. The Song Dynasty inherited this policy. In the late Northern Song Dynasty and early Southern Song Dynasty, a large number of Juejimi prefectures and counties were established in Guangxi. By the Song Dynasty, the central government's decrees could be enforced in the Baise area (Note 17).

From Fan Chengda's description of the Juejimi prefectures and counties in the Zuojiang and Youjiang River basins during the Southern Song Dynasty, it can be seen that the area had already entered class society. The "common people" called "Ti Tuo" cultivated land according to population, and the land could not be sold (but the part that they reclaimed themselves could be disposed of by themselves). In addition to employing these common people, the upper class also "used the captured mountain Liao and bought captured women and men through marriage, pairing them and giving them fields to cultivate, teaching them martial arts, and they were attached to them for generations." These people with slave status were called "family slaves" or "family servants"; the strong ones who could be trained were called "Tian Zi Jia" or "Ma Qian Pai." The upper class had the right to execute them at will (Note 18). Because Guangxi was adjacent to Annam and Dali, and the Song Dynasty's defense capabilities in the south were weak, local officials specially registered or trained the strong men of the Juejimi prefectures and counties through the upper class to prepare for emergencies since the Northern Song Dynasty. These serving strong men were called "Dong Ding," and most of them were people with the above-mentioned slave status. The registered number reached as many as hundreds of thousands (Note 19). During the Jingkang period, some Dong Ding were summoned to Kaifeng to help the Northern Song Dynasty resist the invasion of the Jin people (Note 20). In addition to providing troops, the obligations that the Juejimi prefectures and counties had to fulfill to local officials included paying taxes in rice and silver, and obeying the leadership of the Han officials. Because the central or local control varied, the relationship between them often changed, so the upper class did not always strictly fulfill their obligations. However, under the relationship of political and military cooperation, on the one hand, the leaders of the Juejimi prefectures and counties increasingly accepted Han culture, such as imitating the clothing and residences of the Han upper class, "registering in the interior," recruiting Han intellectuals, sending their children to participate in the imperial examinations, and using a square script imitating Chinese characters (Note 21). On the other hand, since the Song Dynasty, the central or local governments have always given them preferential treatment because they relied on the cooperation of local ethnic minorities to defend the border, and their discrimination against them was lighter than that against other ethnic groups (Note 22). Since the battle of Di Qing's pacification of Nong Zhigao in the Northern Song Dynasty, the relationship between the Zhuang and Han people has generally been good compared with the relationship between other ethnic groups and the Han people.

In the Yuan Dynasty, some Tusi were also enfeoffed in Guangxi. In the Ming Dynasty, Tusi and local officials were almost all over the province except for Wuzhou. The Tusi system of the Ming Dynasty was more complete than that of the previous dynasties, so the contradiction between the Tusi with strong power in the Youjiang River basin and the Han officials often intensified, developing into wars. It is worth noting that some generals who led troops to conquer the ethnic minorities in Guangxi, such as Han Yong and Wang Shouren, still advocated maintaining or establishing Tusi to rule the ethnic minorities after the war. After the Yongzheng period of the Qing Dynasty, due to the central government's firm implementation of the policy of converting Tusi to regular officials in the southwestern provinces, the Tusi and local officials in Guangxi were gradually eliminated. The work of converting Tusi to regular officials was completed within the province during the Kuomintang rule (Note 23).

During the Yuan Dynasty, there were also measures to recruit Zhuang people to cultivate land in the Shangsi area to resist Annam, because the Zhuang people were more accustomed to the local climate and soil than the troops transferred to Guangxi from the north. During the Ming Dynasty, the Yao people of Guangxi were also fought with the help of Tusi armed forces. In the mid-15th century, the Ming Dynasty once transferred a batch of Tusi troops, the "Wolf Soldiers" (Note 24), to garrison near Dayao Mountain to defend against the Yao people, and stipulated that they would guard several important cities in Guangxi and Guangdong every year. Later, this brave and battle-hardened ethnic minority force was also used to quell the disturbances of the Japanese pirates in the southeast. During the Sino-French War in the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, many Zhuang people also participated and defeated the invading French army together with the Han people.

Since the Yuan and Ming dynasties, due to the strict internal control of the Tusi in western Guangxi and the weakening of the combat effectiveness of the national army, the imperial court had to use the Zhuang armed forces through the Tusi. However, the situation in eastern Guangxi was different. Since the Yuan Dynasty, a large number of Zhuang people here have been recruited by the Han people as hired workers and tenants to cultivate wasteland. Some of them were also used by the Han people to fight the Yao people, thus forming a rather complex situation of Zhuang, Yao, and Han mixed living (Note 25). Here, both the Yao and Zhuang people were the most oppressed classes among the peasants, and they worked hard together with the Han working peasants to develop the land in eastern Guangxi, but they suffered an additional layer of national oppression compared with the Han working people. Some officials adopted discriminatory and high-handed methods against these Zhuang and Yao people scattered in various places, and carried out massacres against the Zhuang and Yao people in military operations, resulting in a history of Zhuang and Yao riots in eastern Guangxi throughout the Ming Dynasty. However, these riots or resistance need to be analyzed in detail. Some Han people also participated in or supported their resistance, and it seems that the struggle still had a class nature (Note 26). Down to the mid-19th century, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom movement that arose in Guiping was jointly launched by the Han and Zhuang people. The Yao people also participated (Note 27). During the people's democratic revolution, the Han, Zhuang, and other ethnic working people of Guangxi still fought side by side. We can say that the tradition of cooperative struggle of the Zhuang, Han, and Yao working people has not been interrupted since the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom movement.

From the historical tradition of the Zhuang people defending national defense, helping the Han people resist aggression, and carrying out class struggle together with the Han people for a happy life, and from the scale to which Guangxi has been developed today through the joint reclamation of the Han, Zhuang, and other ethnic groups, we should admit that the Zhuang people have made great contributions to the creation of the great motherland.

Four

The Yao people of Guangxi originally lived north of the Five Ridges and later migrated to Lingnan. They are very different from the indigenous tribes of Lingnan in language and culture. The time of the southward migration is difficult to verify.

After a large number of Han people entered Lingnan, the population increased day by day, and land disputes occurred with the already settled Yao people. In addition, due to the discrimination and oppression of the Yao people by Han officials, from the reign of Yuan Chengzong (early 14th century) to the end of the Ming Dynasty (mid-17th century), Yao riots and resistance occurred continuously. For four hundred years, the Yao rebellions followed one after another, and the flames of war spread to many prefectures and counties in Guangdong and Guangxi, with almost no peaceful years in Guangxi. Among them, the Dateng Gorge Yao rebellion shocked the world. The Ming Dynasty used generals such as Han Yong, Wang Shouren, and Cai Jing, and mobilized troops from all over the world, using troops for decades before and after, and only after three major battles did they basically defeat the Yao people. In each battle, the Yao people suffered cruel massacres. After the Yao people suffered a crushing defeat, some fled into the deep mountains, while other Yao people living on the plains also participated in the struggle of the Han working people against the oppressors due to living among the Han people.

Five

In Guangxi, there are also the Dong, Gelao, and Maonan ethnic groups. The Han people have only a few records about these ethnic groups, and most of them describe their customs and lack materials describing their history. Note:

(13) Xu Songshi, "History of the People of the Yue River Basin," Chapter 9, "The Zhuang People Are Clear Evidence of Indigenous People of Lingnan"; Luo Xianglin, "Baiyue of the Central Summer System," p. 122; Fei Xiaotong, "Preliminary Investigation on the History of the Zhuang People in Guangxi" (New Construction, January 1952). The view that the Zhuang people came from outside, such as Gu Yanwu's Tianxia Junguo Libingshu citing Guangdong Tongzhi, said that the Zhuang people are also called mountain people, who came from the Xidong area of Hunan and later entered Guangxi slightly to cultivate wasteland, but also said that the Zhuang people are Jiu Yue people. There are three types of Guangdong Tongzhi compiled in the Ming Dynasty, namely Dai Jing's compiled in Jiajing fourteen years (1535), Huang Zuo's compiled in Jiajing thirty-six years (1557), and Guo Fei's compiled in Wanli twenty-nine years (1601). I have not seen any of them, so I do not know what Gu's basis is. Qing Jiaqing Guangxi Tongzhi Volume 278 quoted Li Fu's Xiu Guangxi Tongzhi saying, "The Zhuang came from Hubei during the Yuanzheng and Yuanyuan period, or it is not so. Zhuang are Zhuang, and the stubborn people of Yue are fond of attacking and hitting, so they are called Zhuang." According to Hao Yu's Xiu Guangxi Tongzhi Volume 33 in Kangxi twenty-two years (1683), "At the beginning of the Ming Dynasty, there were Zhuang people from Hubei who entered Liugui from Qianzhong." From this, it can be known that Hubei is a name for Zhuang, and it does not mean that the Zhuang people came from Hubei.

(14) Fan Chengda, "Guihai Yuhengzhi" (written in Chunxi two years, 1175) of the Southern Song Dynasty, recorded that the people of the Huang, Nong, and other tribes at that time lived in houses "with two layers of sheds, called Malan, with the upper layer for themselves and the lower layer for raising cattle and pigs." (The existing Ming and Qing editions of Fan's book have many omissions compared with the sections quoted by Ma Duanlin's Wenxian Tongkao. This passage is quoted from Wenxian Tongkao Volume 24.) Zhou Qufei's "Lingwai Daida" (written in Chunxi five years, 1178) also recorded Malan. Wang Tuo of the Ming Dynasty, "Guihai Zhi Xu," said that the customs of the Zhuang people "like to build buildings for both the rich and the poor, called them Lan, with people above and livestock below." (See Qing Jiaqing Guangxi Tongzhi Volume 278 quoted text.) Ming "Yongning Zhouzhi" also said that the Zhuang people "build sheds as houses, sleeping on them, with cattle, horses, dogs, and pigs mixed below." (See Tianxia Junguo Libingshu quoted text.) Qu Dajun, "Guangdong Xinyu" (roughly written in Kangxi thirty-nine years, 1700), said that he had lived in the Gaolan of the Zhuang people, and also said that the Zhuang and Han people lived together from Lipu to Pingnan and were not easy to distinguish. Generally, those who lived in houses were Han people, and those who lived in Lan were Zhuang people. "Lan is made of wood, with people living on top and livestock living below, called Lanfang, also called Gaolan, or Malanzi." Daoguang "Qingyuan Fuzhi" Volume 3 said that the local "custom," "houses are covered with thatch, surrounded by bamboo, and buildings are built with planks, with people living on top and cattle and pigs tied below, called Lanfang." The local custom is described in contrast to the Han custom, and it should refer to the customs of the Zhuang people. What Zhou Qufei and other books said is not necessarily an inheritance of Fan's book.

(15) Song Li Zengbo's "Kezhai Zagaio" (Business Press Reprinted Siku Quanshu Edition) Volume 17 Shuai Guang Tiaochen Five Affairs Memorial: "In Yizhou, there are Tudin, Mindin, Baodin, Yidin, Yixiao, and Zhuangdin, totaling more than 9,000 people." Zhuangdin should be Zhuang people. Li's memorial was in the Chunyou period of Song Lizong (mid-13th century). Also, Song Zhu Fu's "Ximan Congxiao" (Xu Baichuan Xuehai Edition) has a preface by Ye Qian of Qingyuan Yimao saying: "The Man of the Five Creeks are all of Panhu descent. The settlements are divided, and the names also vary. Yuan is its old land, and those who live around the four borders today have five: 'Miao, Yao, Liao, Zhuang, and Gela.'" Qingyuan Yimao is Song Ningzong's Qingyuan one year (1195). However, the term "provincial land" and "provincial people" are frequently seen in the book, and it is suspected that the book was written in the Yuan Dynasty. Also, the ethnic minority settlements recorded in the main text of the book are within the present-day Hunan territory. But there is no mention of the Zhuang people at all.

(16) Now I will briefly record the earliest materials we can see about the Zhuang people: 1. Li Zengbo's Shuai Guang Tiaochen Five Affairs Memorial, the驻地of Zhuangdin should be near Yishan in the present-day Yishan area. 2. Preface to Ximan Congxiao. 3. Yu Ji, Daoyuan Quanjiji Volume 31, Guangxi Du Yuanshuai Zhang Gongping Yaoji, mentioned that the Yuan once used the Zhuang people to oppress the Yao people, and also mentioned that there were Zhuang people in Binzhou (present-day Laibin). This article was written in Zhizheng one year (1341). 4. Yuanshi Liu Guojie's Biography said that in Zhizheng thirty years (1293), after Liu Guojie defeated Huang Shengxu of Shangsizhou (present-day Shangsi), he recruited Zhuang people from Qingyuan to cultivate Huang Shengxu's land as a garrison farm. Yuanshi Wuxingzhi recorded that in Zhizheng eleven years (1351), there were strange birds flying in pairs in Qingyuan Prefecture, Guangxi, and one was shot to death by the Zhuang people in Shukun Township. Yuanshi was completed in the second year of Ming Hongwu (1369). 5. Ming Jiajing Guangxi Tongzhi Volume 53: "The people of Qingyuan Nandan Xidong are called Zhuang, and they have never been to the provincial land. During the Zhizheng period of the Yuan Dynasty, Mo Guoqi Xian Tu Natu was appointed as the An抚使 of Qingyuan and other places. Since then, the Zhuang people have entered the provincial land. Today, there are the most Zhuang people in Lipu, Xiuren, and Yongfu in Guilin." This Tongzhi was completed in Jiajing ten years (1531). According to Yuanshi Dijizhi, Qingyuan Nandan Xidong and other places Junmin An抚司 were established in Zhizheng thirteen years (1276).

(17) Songshi Gaozong Benji, Nandanzhou Zhuan, Fushuizhou Zhuan.

(18) Guihai Yuhengzhi. Lingwai Daida Volume 3 Dongding Tiao Xiayun: "Dongding makes various contributions to water and land products every day according to their duties, and they work hard all year round but cannot get enough to eat. They risk their lives to fight, but they are taxed more heavily. If there is a slight fault, they send their relatives to beheaded upstream and inspect their bodies downstream. When the sun is dim, the chief is drunk and walks around with a sword. Those who do not avoid Dongding in time are beheaded with their hands, and this is used as a way to subdue people. How cruel is it!"

(19) Guihai Yuhengzhi said that there were hundreds of thousands of Dongding registered in Yuanfeng. According to Li Zengbo's Shuai Guang Tiaochen Five Affairs Memorial, the number of Dongding registered in the Zuojiang and Youjiang River basins in the early Southern Song Dynasty was similar to this.

(20) Lingwai Daida Volume 3 Tianzijia Tiao Xia.

(21) Guihai Yuhengzhi. Lingwai Daida Volume 4 Suzi Tiao. The square script originated in the Tang Dynasty, and Comrade Wei Qingwen has already done research on it (see Overview of Minority Languages in China). The so-called "registering in the interior" is probably claiming to be from the interior. As long as we browse through the Qing Jiaqing Guangxi Tongzhi, we will find that many Tusi claim that their ancestors were from Yidu County, Qingzhou Prefecture, Shandong Province. This statement may have been passed down from the Song Dynasty. [Di Qing relied on the help of local ethnic minorities to quell the Nong rebellion, and the ethnic minority leaders who made contributions in the war were also rewarded, see Guihai Yuhengzhi.] In Daoguang Qingyuan Fuzhi, the compiler has already expressed doubts about the Nandan Mo clan Tusi claiming that their ancestors came from Yidu County, Qingzhou Prefecture, Shandong Province based on official history.

(22) Guihai Yuhengzhi: "Today, Juejimi Zhoudong outside the prefecture and county, although they are all barbarians, the land is still close to the province, and the people pay taxes, so they are not called barbarians."

(23) Liu Xifan, "Lingbiao Jiman," Chapter 23, Tusi.

(24) Lang should be read as Liang. According to the records of the Ming and Qing people, Liangren seemed to be a group of people whose language, customs, and habits were similar to those of the Zhuang people but had their own characteristics. Kuang Lu's Chiya has a vivid description of Liangren. Tianxia Junguo Libingshu quoted Ming Wuzhou Fuzhi also said: "Because they come from Tusi, they are called Tubing, because they are managed by headmen, they are called Mubing, and because they are mostly Langren, they are also called Langbing." However, the Tusi who provided Langbing were almost all over western Guangxi, so Liangren should also be everywhere in the west. The nature of Liangbing is similar to that of Tianzijia in the Song Dynasty. The meaning of "Liang" is probably added by the Han people, just like the word "Shu" in "Shu Zhuang," indicating that they can be used by the Han ruling class. Liangren are naturally Zhuangren, but this is only a hypothesis and remains to be explored.

(25) Tianxia Junguo Libingshu recorded Guangdong Tongzhi, Quanzhouzhi Zhutiao. Qing Kangxi Guangxi Tongzhi Volume 33, Gutian, Yangshuo, Yongfu, Luorong, Liucheng Tiao Xia. Kangxi Yangshuo Xianzhi Volume 4 quoted Wang Zongmu Yangshuo Xianjishi.

(26) Qing Jiaqing Guangxi Tongzhi Volume 193 quoted Ming Zhou Qi Tiaochen Difang Libingshu Yun: "During the Yongle period, Liang Gongsong and other thieves from Wuxiang County, Maping County, rebelled, and the coerced followers were no more than seven or eight hundred people, attacking and robbing Shuinan Street and other places in this county. Du Du Han Guan came and used the troops withdrawn from the conquest of Jiaozhi. He swept and leveled the local area of this county through five Du, three Li per Du, a total of eighteen Li, regardless of good or evil, leaving only six Li of the remaining people." Liang Gongsong is a Zhuang person, and "Du" is also a Zhuang word. Another Maping County Master Book Kong Xingshan wrote to the emperor saying: "The Yao and Zhuang people in Xidong... even if they are thieves, how can they have no conscience? In the past, Chen Jingwen was the magistrate, and the Yao and Zhuang people all served, but later the leaders treated them unfairly, and they rebelled again." Volume 189 Yun: "In the eighteenth year of Hongwu, the Guangxi Du Si said that Yao bandits frequently stole and robbed because the people living near Xidong communicated with them and lured them into trouble." Tianxia Junguo Libingshu quoted Guangdong Tongzhi Jiajing twenty-seven years Ouyang Bijin Yan Shanjin, believing that the residents of the countryside were led by the Yao people and served as guides, and also recorded the situation of "mountain thieves" and "treacherous people" colluding. In addition, you can refer to Kangxi Guangxi Tongzhi Volume 33 quoted Ming Guo Yingpin's discussion on the changes in Gutian, Yangshuo and other places.

    广西历史简况
    邓锐龄
    三
    关于僮族的来源，大致有两类说法：一类说僮是从外地迁入广西的，另一类说僮是广西当地的土著。近人徐松石以两广许多地名来源僮语，证明僮族是岭南土著，并指出是古越人的后代。罗香林根据地理分布推测古代的“西瓯”或部分“骆越”人是今天僮族的祖先。费孝通认为僮人自称“布越伊”，“越伊”是“于越”的对音，根据语言系统，推考僮族是古越族一支的后裔（注十三）。比较起来，后一类的说法是可以考虑采用的，但因为来源问题是少数民族历史上最复杂的问题，这类说法还要我们进一步研究证实。僮族可能是古代越族若干部落的后裔，远古以来就定居在岭南，几千年间种族混合、部落迁徙的过程已不可考，但僮族祖先有大部分人可能因和汉族杂居、互通婚姻的缘故，逐渐成为今广东、广西的汉人，而这种趋势几乎一直在进行着。
    唐宋时聚居在广西西部的黄氏、侬氏部族也很可能属于僮族。从地域上看，黄氏、侬氏等部落都居住在今宜山地区、原邕宁专区，而这两个地区到现在仍然是僮族的聚居地区。黄氏迄今还是僮族中的大姓。宋人记载中说到的黄、侬部族人民的“麻栏”，到现在还是僮族人民通用的住屋的形式（注十四）。
    在南宋以前，汉人对于僮族没有一个确定的称谓。除了古代使用过的“越”字外，到六朝以后泛称“蛮”、“獠”，“蛮”、“獠”在当时是一个泛指长江粤江流域异族的称呼，和我们上世纪对外人泛称“洋人”差不多。在记载中出现“僮”字开始于南宋，而且正式见于官吏的报告，但使用的极不普遍（注十五）。到明人的奏疏中，“僮”字才多次出现，而且往往和“瑶”并提，“僮、瑶”代表了广西所有的少数民族。
    为什么僮字使用得这么晚呢？我想，正如许多少数民族长时间内没有把若干部落部族从观念上概括成为一个统一名称一样，汉人确定一个概括性的称呼也必须经过较长的时间。同时，这和从南宋以来汉人知识分子进入广西日益增多，对于当地民族的识别越来越深入有关系。此外，在元代确实又有大批僮族从广西西北部（今宜山地区庆远、南丹及更西地带）迁徙出来，这批僮人是名称为“僮”的部族的一部分，迁徙出来后散布很广，和汉人杂居，因而给汉人以深刻的印象。也许从那时开始，僮这个概念的外延范围越来越扩大，而最后被用做可以概括若干部族的共同称谓了（注十六）。僮应读作撞，广西柳州一带僮人至今自称为“布壮”。
    唐代，僮族部落中以黄氏最强。黄氏以外，还有宁氏、韦氏、周氏、侬氏等部落，都分布在今左右江流域。黄氏失败后，侬氏联合南诏，势力最为强大。北宋时，侬智高起兵，自称仁惠皇帝，设立官职，使用汉人知识分子，攻陷邕州（今南宁），围攻广州，起兵一年后被宋将狄青战败，侬智高逃入大理，不知所终。现百色地区都安一带僮人自称布侬，应是侬氏后裔。
    唐代在广西设立了许多羁縻州县。宋代袭用这一政策。北宋末年和南宋初年，都曾在广西建立大批羁縻州县。到宋代，中央政令才能行使到百色地区（注十七）。
    从南宋范成大关于左右江流域的羁縻州县的记述来看，可以知道当时那里已经进入阶级社会，叫做“提陀”的“百姓”按人口领田地耕种，田地不能典卖（但自己开荒的部分可以归自己支配）。上层在役属这些百姓外，又“以攻剽山獠及博买嫁娶所得生口，男女相配，给田使耕，教以武技，世世隶属。”这些具有奴隶身分的人叫做“家奴”、“家丁”；其中强壮可以训练的叫做“田子甲”或“马前牌”。上层对于他们有随意处死的权利（注十八）。因为广西和安南、大理相邻，宋代在南方防御实力较弱，北宋以来地方官吏特意通过上层登记或训练羁縻州县的壮丁，以备急需。这种服役的壮丁叫做“峒丁”，大多是上述那种具有奴隶身分的人。登记数字最多达到十几万人（注十九）。在靖康时，有一部分峒丁曾经应召到开封帮助北宋抵抗金人的侵略（注二十）。除了提供军队外，羁縻州县对于地方官吏须尽的义务还有交纳税米银钱、服从上级汉官的领导等。因为中央或地方控制力有消长，相互间的关系常有变化，所以上层对于义务不是一直地严格地履行的。可是在政治、军事合作的关系下，一方面羁縻州县的领袖越来越多地接受汉族的文化，如摹仿汉人上层的服装居室、“寄籍内地”、招致汉人知识分子、派子弟应举、使用一种仿照汉字而制造的方块文字等（注二十一），另方面宋代以来中央或地方政权由于依靠当地少数民族的合作来保卫边疆，对于他们总是给予优待，对于他们的歧视比其他民族来得轻（注二十二）。从北宋狄青平侬智高战役以来，僮汉关系和其他民族和汉族关系比较，一般是好的。
    元代在广西也封了一些土司。明代除了梧州一道外，土司土官几乎遍布全省。明代土司制度比前代发展得更完备，因而在右江流域势力强大的土司和汉人官吏间的矛盾往往激烈化，发展为战争。值得注意的是明代一些督率军队征服广西少数民族的将帅如韩雍、王守仁等，在战事结束后，却仍主张维持或建立土司来统治少数民族。从清雍正后，由于中央坚决在西南各省推行改土归流政策，广西土司土官才逐步地被消灭。改土归流工作到国民党统治时代，在全省范围内始告完成（注二十三）。
    元代也有募僮人屯田上思一带以抵御安南的措置，这是因为僮人比从北方调去广西的军队更能习惯于当地气候水土的缘故。明代对广西瑶族进行战争，也引土司武装做为助力。十五世纪中叶，明曾经调一批土司的军队“狼兵”（注二十四），在大瑶山附近屯田以御防瑶族，并且给他们规定了每年戍守广西广东若干重要城市的任务，以后在平定东南倭寇之乱上，也使用过这支勇敢善战的少数民族部队。清光绪时发生的中法战争，也有许多僮人参加，和汉人一起击败法国侵略军队。
    元明以来，由于广西西部土司对于内部控制较严，加以国家军队战斗力的减弱，所以朝廷不得不通过土司来使用僮族武力。但是在广西东部情况又是另外一个样子。这里从元代以来，有大批僮人受汉人的召募充当佣工、佃户，开垦荒地，其中有些人还受汉人利用来打瑶人，因而形成一种僮、瑶、汉杂居关系相当复杂的局面（注二十五）。在这里，瑶、僮都是农民中最受压迫的阶层，他们和汉族劳动农民一起辛勤地开发了广西东部的土地，但是他们比汉族劳动人民还多受一层民族的压迫。有些官吏对于这些散居在各地的僮人瑶人采取歧视高压的办法，在军事行动中对僮人瑶人大肆屠杀，致使有明一代，广西东部僮、瑶暴动史不绝书。不过对于这些暴动或反抗还需要细加分析。有些汉族人民也曾经参加或支持他们的反抗，看来斗争还是带有阶级性质的（注二十六）。降及十九世纪中叶在桂平兴起的太平天国运动还是汉僮人民共同发动的。瑶族人民也参加了（注二十七）。在人民民主革命时期，广西汉僮以及其他民族的劳动人民仍然并肩在一起作战。我们可以说僮汉瑶劳动人民合作斗争的传统从太平天国运动以来一直没有中断。
    从僮族人民保卫国防，帮助汉族抵抗侵略和同汉族人民一起为争取幸福生活而进行的阶级斗争的历史传统看来，从经过汉僮以及其他民族共同开垦广西发展到今天的规模看来，我们应承认，僮族人民对于伟大祖国的缔造是有巨大的贡献的。

    广西省瑶族最早居住在五岭以北，以后迁入岭南。他们和岭南土著部落，在语言文化上有很大的不同。南迁的时间很难考证。
    汉族大量进入岭南后，生口日滋，和已经定居的瑶族人民发生土地争夺，加以汉人官吏对瑶族的歧视压迫，从元成宗时（十四世纪初）到明末（十七世纪中叶），瑶族的暴动反抗，不断发生。先后四百年间，瑶族叛乱前仆后继，战火波及两广许多州县，广西几无宁岁。其中如大藤峡瑶民暴动，震动天下。明用韩雍、王守仁、蔡经等将师，征调天下兵力，用兵前后数十年，经过三次大战，才把瑶民基本上击败。每次战役中，瑶人受到很惨酷的屠杀。瑶族惨败后，一部分逃入深山，另外居住在平地上的瑶族因和汉族杂居，也参加过汉族劳动人民的反抗压迫者的斗争。
    五
    在广西还有侗、仡佬、毛难等民族，汉族关于这些民族记载，仅有寥寥几条，而且大多记述他们的生活风俗，缺少叙述他们的历史的材料。注：
    （十三）徐松石“粤江流域人民史”第九章“僮乃岭南土著的明证”；罗香林“中夏系统之百越”页122；费孝通“关于广西僮族历史的初步推考”（新建设1952年1月号）。僮族来自外地的说法，如顾炎武天下郡国利病书引广东通志称僮人又称山人，出湖南溪洞，后稍入广西，佃种荒田云云，但又谓僮是臼越人。明代所修的广东通志有三种即嘉靖十四年（1535）戴璟修、嘉靖三十六年（1557）黄佐修、万历二十九年（1601）郭棐修，我都没有见过，不知顾氏何所据。清嘉庆广西通志卷二百七十八引李绂修广西通志云“獞以元正元间来自湖北或曰非也，獞者撞也，粤之顽民性喜攻击撞突，故曰撞。”按先于李志在康熙二十二年（1683）郝浴修的广西通志卷三十三云：“明初有湖北撞者由黔中入柳桂”，由此可知湖北乃僮的一个名称，并不是说僮族从湖北来的。
    （十四）南宋范成大“桂海虞衡志”（书成于淳熙二年、1175）记当时黄侬等部落人民居住的屋内，“为两重棚，谓之麻栏，上以自处，下蓄牛豕”。（范书现有明、清刻本，以马端临文献通考引用的数节相较，则脱落很多，此段引自文献通考卷二十四。）周去非“岭外代答”（书成于淳熙五年、1178）也记载了麻栏。明王土性“桂海志续”称僮人风俗“贫富俱喜架楼，名之曰栏，上人下畜”。（见清嘉庆广西通志卷二百七十八引文。）明“永宁州志”也说僮人“架棚为室，寝处其上，其下杂畜牛马犬豕。”（见天下郡国利病书引文。）屈大均“广东新语”（大抵书成于康熙三十九年、1700）说他曾住过僮人的高栏，又说自荔浦至平南僮与汉人杂居不易辨别，大抵屋居者是汉人，栏居者是僮人，“栏、架木为之，上以栖人，下以栖群畜，名栏房，亦曰高栏，曰麻栏子。”道光“庆远府志”卷三说当地“土俗”，“居室复茅，周围编竹，以板架楼，上住人，下羁牛豕，名曰栏房。”土俗是同汉俗对比地叙述的，当指僮人风俗言。周去非以下诸书所云都不见得是沿袭范书的。
    （十五）宋李曾伯“可斋杂稿”（商务印书馆影印四库全书本）卷十七帅广条陈五事奏：“在宜州则有土丁、民丁、保丁、义丁、义效、撞丁共九千余人。”撞丁当即僮人。李奏在宋理宗淳祐时（十三世纪中叶）。又宋朱辅“溪蛮丛笑”（续百川学海本）前有庆元乙卯叶钱序云：“五溪之蛮皆槃瓠种也。聚落区分，名亦随异。沅其故壤，环四封而居者，今有五：‘曰猫、曰猺、曰獠、曰獞、曰犵狫。’”庆元乙卯乃宋宁宗庆元一年（1195）。但书中“省地”“省民”之称屡见，疑成书或在元时。又书正文中所记少数民族聚居地区在今湖南境内。但一点没有谈到关于僮族的情况。
    （十六）现将我们所能见到的最早记载僮的几条材料简记于下：1、李曾伯帅广条陈五事奏，撞丁驻地当在今宜山地区宜山一带。2、溪蛮丛笑序文。3、虞集道园全集卷三十一广西都元帅章公平瑶记，提到元曾利用僮族来压迫瑶族，又说到在宾州（今来宾）有僮人。此文作于至正元年（1341）。4、元史刘国杰传说至元三十年（1293）刘国杰打败上思州（今上思）黄圣许后，募庆远诸撞人耕种黄圣许地，作为屯田。元史五行志记载至正十一年（1351），广西庆远府有异禽双飞，现于述昆乡，被撞人射死一只。元史修成于明洪武二年（1369）。5、明嘉靖广西通志卷五十三云：“庆远南丹溪洞之人呼为獞，初未尝至省地，元至正间，莫国麒献图纳土，命为庆远等处军民安抚使，自是獞人方入省地，今桂之荔浦、修仁、永福最多。”这个通志修成于嘉靖十年（1531）。据元史地记志至元十三年（1276）置庆远南丹溪洞等处军民安抚司。
    （十七）宋史高宗本纪、南丹州传、抚水州传。
    （十八）桂海虞衡志。岭外代答卷三峒丁条下云：“峒丁日各以职供水陆之产，为之力作终岁而不得一饱，为之效死战争而复加科敛，一有微过，遣所亲军斩之上流而自于下流阅其尸也。日曛，酋醉酣，仗剑散步，峒丁避之不及者，手刃焉，类以此为服人之威，何其酷也！”
    （十九）桂海虞衡志称元丰中籍峒丁数十余万。又据李曾伯帅广条陈五事奏，南宋初年，左右江流域籍峒丁数字与此相近。
    （二十）岭外代答卷三田子甲条下。
    （二十一）桂海虞衡志。岭外代答卷四俗字条。方块字创始于唐代，韦庆稳同志已有考证（见国内少数民族语言文字的概况）。所谓“寄籍内地”大概就是自称内地籍贯。只要我们翻阅一下清嘉庆广西通志就发现许多土司都自称祖先是山东青州府益都县人，这种说法也许从宋代一直沿传下来。〔狄青平侬氏曾经依靠了当地少数民族的帮助，在战争中立功的少数民族领袖也都受到封赏，见桂海虞衡志。〕在道光庆远府志中，编纂者已经根据正史，对南丹莫氏土官自称祖先来自山东青州府益都县提出怀疑了。
    （二十二）桂海虞衡志：“今郡县之外羁縻州洞，虽故皆蛮，地犹近省，民供税役，故不以蛮命之。”
    （二十三）刘锡蕃“岭表纪蛮”第二十三章土司。
    （二十四）狼应读做良。良人根据明清人记载仿佛是一部分语言风俗习惯与僮族相近而又具有自己的特征的人。邝露赤雅对良人有一段生动的描写。天下郡国利病书引明梧州府志也说：“以其出自土司故曰土兵，以其有头目管之故曰目兵，又以其多狼人亦曰狼兵。”但提供狼兵的土司几乎遍布在广西西部，因此，良人也应该在西部到处都有。良兵性质和宋代的“田子甲”相近，“良”的意义大概是汉人加上的，如同“熟撞”的熟字一样，说明它们是可以供汉族统治阶级利用的。良人自然是僮人，但是这只是假设，还有待于探讨。
    （二十五）天下郡国利病书录广东通志、全州志诸条。清康熙广西通志卷三十三、古田、阳朔、永福、雒容、柳城条下。康熙阳朔县志卷四引王宗沐阳朔县记事。
    （二十六）清嘉庆广西通志卷一百九十三引明周琦条陈地方利病书云：“永乐年间马平县五乡贼人梁公竦等作乱，胁从者不过七、八百人，攻劫本县水南街等处，都督韩观来，以征进交趾退回兵力，将本县地方通五都，每都三里共一十八里不分善恶一扫而平，遗下残民止得六里。”梁公竦是僮人，“都”也是僮语。另马平县主簿孔性善上书皇帝说：“溪洞猺獞……虽盗贼岂无良心，昔者陈景文为知县，猺獞皆应役，厥后长吏抚字乖方，始复反侧。”卷一百八十九云：“洪武十八年广西都司言频年猺寇窃发，皆因居近溪洞之民与之相通诱引为患。”天下郡国利病书引广东通志嘉靖二十七年欧阳必进严山禁，认为乡村的居民为瑶倡率向导，又记“山贼”和“奸民”交结情况。另外可以参看康熙广西通志卷三十三引明郭应聘对古田、阳朔等地变乱的议论。
