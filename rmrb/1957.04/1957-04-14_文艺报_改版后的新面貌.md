    The "Literary Gazette," formerly a bi-monthly publication, has been transformed into a weekly magazine starting with this issue. The first issue was published on April 14th. The format is octavo, twice the size of the previous one. The layout is also more lively and eye-catching than before. The content has been expanded with two pages of literary news, reporting on the creations and activities of writers and artists, as well as publishing and performance news. Foreign literary trends have also increased compared to the past. Literary criticism, which was the main content of the "Literary Gazette," still occupies a significant amount of space. The main articles in this issue include the editorial "Striving for the Great Prosperity of Socialist Literature and Art," opinions of writers such as Yu Pingbo, Zhu Guangqian, Fang Ji, and Wei Junyi on the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," and comments on the "Film's Gongs and Drums" article written by the "Literary Gazette" commentator last year.

    The editorial elaborated on the great significance of the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy put forward by the Party Central Committee, believing that this policy "is another example of the combination of the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and China's specific realities." It "is a creative development of Marxism-Leninism in the process of socialist construction in China and in the cultural field. Correctly and resolutely implementing this policy will greatly improve the ideological level of China's intellectual circles, thereby promoting China's science, literature, and art to a new stage of great prosperity." The editorial also criticized two erroneous tendencies in the implementation of the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy: right-leaning opportunism and dogmatism. The editorial pointed out that these two tendencies seriously hinder the implementation of this policy, so "it is necessary to remove the shackles of dogmatism, overcome the wavering and regression of right-leaning opportunism, and conduct a two-front struggle in ideological work." The editorial also expressed opinions on the current debates on literary creation issues, believing that on the one hand, it is necessary to overcome "various dogmatic and sectarian understandings of socialist realism"; but on the other hand, "to practice the 'Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom' of literature and art, to develop socialist literature and art, and to make our works have profound realistic content and rich and colorful styles and forms, the main thing lies in the hard work of writers, and in the combination of writers, artists, and mass life." The editorial also analyzed the relationship between fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds, and what attitude should be taken towards the phenomenon of fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds growing together, saying: "For so-called poisonous weeds, we cannot adopt the method of not allowing them to grow, nor can we adopt the method of letting them grow unchecked. We should... make fragrant flowers gain stronger vitality in this competition, comparison, and struggle." Finally, the editorial pointed out: "Building a socialist cultural mansion is a huge and complex task. It is necessary to fully mobilize all positive factors that are conducive to this work, so that everyone can offer ideas and suggestions, and everyone can move bricks and earth. The policy of 'Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend' is to mobilize all positive forces in the intellectual circles to carry out labor competition for the construction of socialist culture, and to learn from each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses in criticism and competition, and seek common unity and progress."

    How to implement the Party's policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" is the most concerning issue in the current literary and art circles. This issue of "Literary Gazette" also published articles by several writers. Yu Pingbo said: "First of all, we must admit that there are contradictions in socialist society, and they are phenomena that should exist in development... To solve these contradictions, we must distinguish right from wrong and persuade people with 'reason,' not subdue people with 'force.' The policy of 'Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend' is not only an important way to discover truth and develop science, but also a central link in the process of socialist social construction for intellectuals and the broad masses of people to transform their thinking." Zhu Guangqian, in his article "Talking about the Hundred Schools of Thought Contending from Personal Experience," frankly and sincerely stated: "Before the call for 'Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend' came out, I had not written an academic article or read a decent aesthetics book for five or six years, nor had I seriously thought about a certain issue in aesthetics. The reason for this is not because I was unwilling, but because I dared not." Then he said: "When the call for 'Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend' came out, I breathed a sigh of relief. It's not just me who felt this way. Whenever old intellectuals with idealist imprints that I knew met and talked about this 'gospel,' none of them were overjoyed. To be honest, from that time on, we took a big step towards the Communist Party in our hearts. We were overjoyed, not because we were celebrating that idealism could raise its head from now on, but because we were celebrating that our idealism baggage could be put down in the most rational and effective way from now on, and that we could still use our useful remaining years to contribute to the motherland that everyone loves."

    Li Qing's article "One-Sided Judgments" refuted several principled erroneous arguments in the article "Film's Gongs and Drums," pointing out that this article has great one-sidedness. First of all, the author pointed out: The "Literary Gazette" commentator's eyes cannot see factories, mines, rural areas, and troops. He hastily drew pessimistic conclusions based only on the poor attendance rates of certain films in Shanghai and Beijing cinemas, saying that "the result of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers 'became abstract'!" At the same time, "'box office value' was regarded as the only criterion for testing problems. Based on one-sided materials, one-sided conclusions were drawn, saying that serving workers, peasants, and soldiers in movies, wouldn't that become 'abstract?' Then, the reason for this 'abstraction' was blamed on the so-called 'trying to describe workers, peasants, and soldiers as much as possible'! This made him stray further and further from the wrong path." Secondly, "Film's Gongs and Drums" also has one-sidedness in criticizing film leaders. Li Qing said: This article "gives the impression that it is better for the Party and the government to intervene less in the powerful tool of film that affects millions of people. This is naturally extremely wrong." Third, "When the author of 'Film's Gongs and Drums' talked about past traditions and experiences, he did not use class analysis and historical observation at all. ... He did not see the difference between the two traditions and two experiences, and did not see that the most important experience of progressive films in the past was the reflection of the spirit of the times and the spirit of the people, that is, the reflection of the wishes and demands of the people, so it was loved by the people. Losing this is truly 'losing everything.'" However, the author of "Film's Gongs and Drums," "after criticizing the sectarian emotions of kicking away the past in one go, asserted that 'everything in the past was right.'" The author sharply pointed out: This one-sided nihilistic criticism of socialist literature and art, "if it is a tragedy, it is a tragedy of one-sidedness, a tragedy of losing logical ability, and a tragedy of right-leaning opportunism in panic in the face of difficulties." I believe that this criticism will play a powerful role in clarifying the current discussions on film work and the confusing thoughts caused by the "Film's Gongs and Drums" article.

    In mid-March of this year, the Writers Association held a "Creative Planning Symposium," which was attended by many famous writers. The article "On Creative Planning and Other Matters" published in this issue of "Literary Gazette" is the concluding remarks made by Mao Dun, Chairman of the Writers Association, at this meeting. In his speech, Mao Dun explained the benefits and related issues of making plans, and also expressed many insightful opinions on some creative issues discussed at the meeting. For example, some comrades raised the question of whether the content of works should be mainly praise or criticism. His reply was: "In real life, there are things that we are willing to praise with the highest enthusiasm, and there are also things that need to be criticized with the same enthusiasm; but criticism is for spurring on, for warning, for drawing lessons from it, in a word, it is also for consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship and for the interests of the people; our criticism is not 'for the sake of criticism.'""Therefore, the question of 'which is the main one' does not arise, but the main thing is the author's position and attitude."

      The "Literary Gazette" editorial department plans to continue to widely publish opinions from people in literary and art circles on further implementing the policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" in the near future. It also prepares to vigorously launch research and discussions on socialist realism and short story writing, and will publish articles by Chen Yong, Li Changzhi, Mao Dun, Wei Jinzhi, and others. In May of this year, it will be the fifteenth anniversary of Chairman Mao Zedong's speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art. At that time, the "Literary Gazette" plans to publish a series of articles to clarify the profound influence of this speech on the literary and art movement and further promote the direction of literary and art adhering to serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. In addition, the editors are also preparing to explore how to reflect the contradictions among the people in literary and artistic works.

    “文艺报”改版后的新面貌文　泊
    原来是半月刊的“文艺报”，从这期起改为周刊，第一号在4月14日出版。版面是八开，比以前大了一倍。编排也比以前活泼醒目，内容增加了两个版的文艺新闻，报道作家、艺术家的创作和活动，以及出版、演出消息；外国文艺动态也比过去增多。原为“文艺报”主要内容的文艺评论，仍占有较多的篇幅。本期主要论文有社论“争取社会主义文学艺术的高度繁荣”，俞平伯、朱光潜、方纪、韦君宜等作家关于“百花齐放、百家争鸣”方针的意见以及对去年“文艺报”评论员所作“电影的锣鼓”一文的评论等。
    社论阐述了党中央提出的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”方针的重大意义，认为这个方针“是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和我国具体实际相结合的又一个范例”，它“是马克思列宁主义在我国社会主义建设过程中、在文化领域内的一个创造性的发展。正确地坚决地贯彻这个方针，一定会大大提高我国知识界的思想水平，从而把我国的科学、文学、艺术推进到一个高度繁荣的新阶段。”社论还批判了在贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”方针时的两种错误倾向：右倾机会主义和教条主义。社论指出：这两种倾向严重地阻碍了这一方针的贯彻执行，因此，“必须解除教条主义的束缚，克服右倾机会主义的动摇和倒退，必须在思想工作上进行两条战线的斗争。”社论同时对目前在文艺创作问题上的争论，也提出了意见，认为一方面需要克服“对于社会主义现实主义的各种教条式的、宗派主义的理解”；但另一方面，“要实践文艺的‘百花齐放’、要发展社会主义的文艺，使我们作品具有深刻的现实内容和丰富多采的风格和形式，主要在于作家的辛勤劳动，在于作家、艺术家和群众生活的结合。”社论对于香花和毒草的关系，以及对香花和毒草齐长的现象应当采取什么态度的问题，也作了分析，说：“对于所谓毒草，不能采取不允许其生长的办法，也不是采取听任自流的办法，应该……使香花在这竞赛、比较和斗争的过程中，获得更强健的生命。”最后社论指出：“建设社会主义的文化大厦，这是十分巨大的复杂的工作。必须把一切有利于这个工作的积极因素充分发动起来，大家来出谋画策，大家来搬砖动土。‘百花齐放、百家争鸣’的方针就是要把知识界一切积极力量发动起来，为建设社会主义文化而进行劳动竞赛，在批评和竞赛中互相地取长补短，求得共同的团结与进步。”
    关于如何贯彻党的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”这一方针问题，是当前文艺界所最关心的，这期“文艺报”还发表了几位作家的文章。俞平伯说：“首先必须承认在社会主义的社会有矛盾存在着，而且是发展中应该有的现象……解决这些矛盾，必须明辨是非，以
  ‘理’来说服人，不用‘力’来压服人。‘百家争鸣’这个方针，不仅为发见真理、发展科学的重要途径，也是在社会主义社会建设过程中，知识分子和广大人民改造思想的中心环节。”朱光潜在“从切身的经验谈百家争鸣”一文中，则坦率诚恳地表示：“在‘百家争鸣’的号召出来之前，有五、六年的时间我没有写一篇学术性的文章，没有读一部像样的美学书籍，或是就美学里某个问题认真地作一番思考。其所以如此，并非由于我不愿，而是由于我不敢。”接着他说：“‘百家争鸣’的号召出来了，我就松了一大口气。不但是我一个人如此，凡是我所认识的有唯心主义烙印的旧知识分子一见面谈到这个‘福音’，没有一个不喜形于色的。老实说，从那时起，我们在心理上向共产党迈进了一大步。我们喜形于色，倒不是庆幸唯心主义从此可以抬头，而是庆幸我们的唯心主义的包袱从此可以用最合理最有效的方式放下，我们还可以趁有用的余年在学术上替大家一样心爱的祖国出一把力。”
    黎青作“片面性的论断”一文批驳了“电影的锣鼓”一文中的几个有原则性错误的论点，指出这篇文章有很大的片面性。首先，作者指出：“文艺报”评论员的眼光看不到工厂、矿山、农村和部队，他只根据上海、北京影院某些影片上座率不佳的材料，就匆忙的得出了悲观的结论，说什么“为工农兵服务的结果‘成了抽象’了！”同时，“把‘票房价值’当成了检验问题的唯一标准，根据片面的材料，得出片面性的结论，说什么电影为工农兵服务，岂不成了‘抽象？’跟着又把造成这个‘抽象’的原因归罪于所谓‘尽量地描写工农兵’！这就使他从歧路上越走越远了”。其次，
  “电影的锣鼓”一文在指责电影领导的时候，也有片面性，黎青说：这篇文章“给人一种印象，似乎对于电影这个影响千百万群众的强大工具，党和政府还是少插手为妙。这自然是极其错误的。”第三，“‘电影的锣鼓’的作者在谈到过去的传统和经验的时候，却丝毫没有运用阶级的分析和历史的观察。……他没有看到两种传统，两种经验的区别，没有看到过去进步电影的经验，最主要的是时代精神、人民精神的反映，即反映了人民群众的愿望和要求，因此才受到人民的热爱，丢掉了这个，才真是‘丢掉了一切’。”可是，“电影的锣鼓”的作者，“在指责了把过去一脚踢开的宗派主义情绪之后，断言‘过去的一古脑儿都对’”，作者尖锐地指出：这种对于社会主义文学艺术片面性的虚无主义的批评，“如果说是悲剧，那是片面性的悲剧，失去逻辑能力的悲剧，在困难前面惊惶失措的右倾机会主义的悲剧。”我认为，这篇批评对于当前电影工作的讨论和对于“电影的锣鼓”一文所引起的一些混乱思想，都将起到有力的廓清的作用。
    今年3月中旬，作家协会召开了“创作规划座谈会”，不少著名作家都出席了这次会议，发表在这期“文艺报”上的“关于创作规划及其它”一文，就是作家协会主席茅盾在这个会上所作的结束语。在讲话中，茅盾对于订规划的好处及有关问题作了说明，同时对于会上谈到的一些创作上的问题，也发表了许多精辟的意见，例如有同志提出作品内容以歌颂为主，还是以批评为主的问题，他的答复是：“现实生活中有我们愿以最高的热情去歌颂的东西，也有需要我们以同样的热情去批评的东西；但批评是为了鞭策，为了示戒，为了从中吸取教训，一句话，也就是为了巩固人民民主专政，为了人民的利益；我们的批评不是‘为了批评而批评’。”“因此，不发生‘何者为主’的问题，但主要的倒是作者的立场和态度的问题。”
      “文艺报”编辑部计划在最近一个时期内，还将继续广泛发表文艺界人士对进一步贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针的意见，准备大力展开关于社会主义现实主义、短篇小说写作的研究和讨论，将发表陈涌、李长之、茅盾、魏金枝等人的文章；今年5月间是毛泽东主席在延安文艺座谈会上讲话十五周年，届时“文艺报”准备发表一系列的文章来阐明这次讲话对文艺运动的深刻影响，进一步宣扬文艺坚持为工农兵服务的方向。此外，编辑还准备对如何在文学艺术作品中反映人民内部矛盾的问题进行探讨。
