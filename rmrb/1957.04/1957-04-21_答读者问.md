Answering Readers' Questions
Editor's Note: On April 20th, this newspaper published the State Council's "Decision on the Supply of Cotton Cloth in 1957." That afternoon, the editorial department received a batch of letters from readers raising some questions on this matter, which are now answered as follows.

Question: Why should the second phase of cloth coupons this year be used at half their face value?

Answer: The "Decision on the Supply of Cotton Cloth in 1957" promulgated by the State Council on April 20th stipulates that the second phase of cloth coupons valid from May 1st to August 31st, 1957, shall be used at half their face value.

As everyone knows, the cloth coupons currently in use were issued between July and August last year. At that time, the state, based on the estimated cotton cloth production and possible supply, issued cloth coupons for the year from September of last year to August of this year. However, in 1956, some areas suffered from typhoons and floods, resulting in reduced cotton production, and the state's cotton procurement plan could not be completed. According to recent procurement figures, it is estimated that by August this year, the state will receive three to four million dan less cotton than originally anticipated. Assuming one dan of cotton can weave ten bolts of cloth, this means a reduction in production of thirty to forty million bolts of cloth. In addition, commercial departments inappropriately relaxed the supply of cotton cloth last year, resulting in increased sales; therefore, the quantity of cotton cloth that the state can supply this year will be less than the amount intended at the time of issuing cloth coupons last year. To balance production and sales, the state has adopted the measure of using the second phase of cloth coupons, valid from May to August, at half their face value.

Question: Now that the state has already issued cloth coupons this year, is it possible to supply them at full value without any discount, and then issue fewer coupons in the next year?

Answer: Although this is also a solution, reducing the number of cloth coupons issued next year may prevent many people from making cotton clothes this winter (because part of next year's cloth coupons will be used this year). Therefore, this "eating tomorrow's food today" approach is inappropriate. May to August is a warm season, and reducing the supply of cotton cloth at this time, meaning one less summer garment, has a smaller impact on people's lives. Considering the long-term needs, adopting the method of discounting the second phase of cloth coupons to ensure the supply of cloth for the vast majority of consumers in winter is a more prudent and feasible approach.

Question: Why is the second phase of cloth coupons used at half value, while the first phase of cloth coupons is not discounted?

Answer: The cloth coupons for this year are divided into two phases. The first phase is valid from September 1st of last year to the end of August this year, and the second phase is valid from May 1st to the end of August this year. The quantity of cloth supplied in phases is such that the first phase accounts for approximately 65% to 70%, while the second phase accounts for approximately 35% to 30%. From the perspective of general consumption, some people have already used more of their first-phase cloth coupons, while others have used less. If the first-phase cloth coupons were also discounted, it would create an unreasonable situation where some people buy more and others buy less. At the same time, based on the cotton cloth supply situation, the state can balance production and sales after adopting the measure of discounting the second phase of cloth coupons; therefore, the first phase of cloth coupons can still be used at full value for purchasing cloth.

    答读者问
    编者按：4月20日，本报发表了国务院“关于1957年棉布供应的决定”。当天下午，编辑部收到一批读者来信，就这方面提出了一些问题，现在回答如下。
    问：今年第二期布票为什么要对折使用？
    答：国务院4月20日公布的“关于1957年棉布供应的决定”中规定1957年5月1日至8月31日通用的第二期布票一律按票面数额对折使用。
    大家知道今年使用的布票是在去年7、8月间发出的。当时国家根据棉布预计产量和可能供应量，发行了去年9月至今年8月一个年度的布票。但是1956年有些地区受到台风和水涝灾害的影响，棉花减产，国家收购棉花计划不能完成。根据最近收购情况来看，预计到今年8月止，国家能收到的棉花要比原来预计数少收三百到四百多万担。以一担棉花纺织十匹布来算，就要少生产三千到四千多万匹布。加上商业部门在去年不适当的放宽了棉布供应，多销了布匹；因此今年国家可能供应的棉布数量要比去年发行布票时所打算的供应量减少。为使产销数量能够平衡，国家采取对5至8月通用的第二期布票对折使用的措施。
    问：今年国家既然已经发了布票，是否可以不打折扣照数供应，在下一年度发行布票时少发一些？
    答：这虽然也是一种办法，但是如果少发下一年度的布票，今年冬季可能使很多人做不上棉衣（因为明年度的布票有一部分要在今年使用）。因此，这种“寅吃卯粮”的办法是不妥当的。5至8月是温暖的季节，国家在这样的时候少供应一部分棉布，少做一件夏衣，对人民生活的影响较小。从长远的需要来考虑，采取第二期布票折扣使用的办法，以保证广大消费者冬季用布的供应，是比较稳妥可行的办法。
    问：为什么第二期布票对折使用，而第一期布票不折扣？
    答：本年度布票分为两期，第一期是从去年9月1日通用到8月底，第二期从今年5月1日到8月底通用；分期供应布匹的数量，第一期比重大约占65％—70％，第二期比重大约占35％—30％。从一般消费的实际情况来看，有些人第一期布票已用去较多，有些人则用去较少，如果将第一期布票也采取折扣使用，对广大消费者来说，就会产生有的多买、有的少买的不合理现象。同时国家根据棉布货源情况，采取第二期布票对折使用后，产销已能平衡，因此第一期布票仍可继续十足购布。
