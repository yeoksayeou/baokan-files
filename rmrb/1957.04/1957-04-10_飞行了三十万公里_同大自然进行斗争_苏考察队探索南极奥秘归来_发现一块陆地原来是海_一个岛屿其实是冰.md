Xinhua News Agency, 9th Dispatch: According to TASS reports, the first group of Soviet Antarctic expedition members have returned to Moscow on the 8th after nearly 400 days of scientific exploration in Antarctica.

Somov, the captain of the Antarctic Comprehensive Expedition, and several team leaders recently gave talks, briefly summarizing the research work during this period.

The first group of Soviet Antarctic expedition members landed on the sixth continent in January of last year. Ninety-two Soviet scientists fought against the harsh natural environment and established the scientific base "Mirny" observatory station on the inaccessible shore. This base has research institutions such as an ionospheric station, a geophysical laboratory, and a glacier laboratory. They also carried out scientific research work on geology, glaciers, gravity, magnetism, meteorology, and other projects in Antarctica. At the same time, they also inspected the inaccessible areas where the "Vostok" and "Sovetskaya" scientific stations were about to be established and carried out preparations for the construction of the stations.

The expedition's planes and helicopters flew nearly 300,000 kilometers over the continent and ocean in a year. Flights were not even interrupted during the severe winter. This is the first time in the history of Antarctic exploration.

The expedition's tracked vehicles traveled more than 18,000 kilometers in Antarctica in a year, approximately half the length of the equator.

In various exploration and research activities, Soviet scientists discovered some materials of scientific value. The results of their measurements of ice thickness in eastern Antarctica showed that the ice thickness in the "Mirny" area is 80 to 200 meters, and under this ice is not land, but the seabed. This measurement also determined that a fairly large Drygalski Island located north of "Mirny" is actually a large piece of ice, 500 meters thick, resting on reefs.

After long-term observations, the high-altitude meteorological observation team found that a so-called central cyclone forms westward from "Mirny" during the cold half of the year, which is similar to the cyclones near Iceland. Previously, such cyclones were only found in the Ross Sea, Weddell Sea, and other places in Antarctica.

In addition, it has also been confirmed that there is an Antarctic anticyclone over Antarctica. An interesting feature of Antarctic cyclones is that they rarely move over the coastal ocean, but their activity intensifies when they cross the coastline and advance inland.

As a result of long-term reconnaissance flights, navigators have made many revisions and additions to the flight maps, clarifying the positions and outlines of coastlines and sandbar glaciers, drawing new islands on the geological maps, and marking places that were previously drawn incorrectly.

    飞行了三十万公里　同大自然进行斗争
    苏考察队探索南极奥秘归来
    发现一块陆地原来是海　一个岛屿其实是冰
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联第一批南极考察人员在南极进行了将近四百天的科学考察工作后，已经在8日回到莫斯科。
    南极综合考察队队长索莫夫和一些工作队的队长不久前发表了谈话，简单地总结了这段时期的研究工作。
    苏联第一批南极考察人员是去年1月间在第六大洲登陆的。九十二位苏联科学家同艰苦的自然环境进行了斗争，在难以到达的岸边建立了科学基地“和平村”观测站。这个基地拥有电离层站、地球物理实验室、冰川实验室等研究机构。他们并且在南极大陆展开了地质、冰川、重力、磁性、气象等项目的科学研究工作，同时，还考察了即将建立“东方”和“苏维埃”科学站的难以到达的地区，进行了建站的准备工作。
    考察队的飞机和直升飞机一年中在大陆和海洋上空飞行了将近三十万公里的路程。甚至在严寒的冬季也没有中断过飞行。这在南极考察史上，还是第一次。
    考察队的履带式汽车一年中在南极一共行驶了一万八千多公里，约等于赤道长度的一半。
    在各项考察研究活动中，苏联科学家发现了一些富有科学价值的材料。他们在南极东部测量冰层厚度的结果表明，“和平村”地区冰层的厚度是八十到二百公尺，在这块冰下面不是陆地，而是海底。通过这种测量还确定，位于“和平村”北部的一个相当大的德里加尔斯基岛，实际上是一个复在暗礁上的厚度达五百公尺的大冰块。
    高空气象观测队经过长期观测的结果查明，在寒冷的半年中从“和平村”向西形成一种所谓中央气旋，它同冰岛附近的气旋相似。在这以前，在南极只有罗斯海、威德尔海等地才有这种气旋。
    此外，还证实在南极洲上空有南极反气旋。南极气旋的有趣的特点是在沿岸的海洋上空极少移动，而穿过海岸线向大陆前进时活动就加剧了。
    由于长期侦察飞行的结果，领航员们对飞行地图作了不少修改和补充，使岸线和砂洲冰河的位置和轮廓明确起来了，给地质地图画上了新的岛屿，并且标出了以前画得不对的地方。（附图片）
