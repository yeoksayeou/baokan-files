    Mass Sports Activities in a Factory
    The Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory has been doing a great job in promoting mass sports activities. They now have fifteen men's basketball teams, seven women's basketball teams, seven soccer teams, and nineteen men's table tennis teams. In addition, they also have badminton teams, track and field teams, wrestling teams, and so on.
    Because they operate on a three-shift system, the factory's sports grounds are lively all day long. Some are practicing running, others are playing basketball or badminton. During the factory's rest days, many employees also go to the gymnasium to swim or practice shooting at the factory's shooting range. Last year, their track and field athletes all broke the factory records of 1955. Their women's basketball team represented the First Ministry of Machine Building in the National Class B Basketball League last year. Electrician Gao Shixiang won second place in the men's 10,000-meter cycling event at the Second Beijing Workers' Games.

    一个工厂的群众性体育活动
    北京农业机械厂群众性的体育活动，开展得很好。现在他们有十五个男子篮球队、七个女子篮球队、七个足球队和十九个男子乒乓球队，另外还有羽毛球队、田径队、摔跤队等等。
    他们是三班制，所以厂内的运动场上整日是热热闹闹。有的练跑步，有的打篮球、打羽毛球。遇着厂的休息日，许多职工还去体育馆游泳，去厂内的靶场练习射击。去年，他们的田径运动员全部刷新了1955年的厂纪录。他们的女子篮球队去年代表第一机械工业部参加了全国乙级篮球联赛。电工高士祥获得了北京市第二届工人运动会男子自行车一万公尺第二名。
    ①练球去。代表第一机械工业部参加去年的全国乙级篮球联赛女子组比赛的就是“农机”女子篮球队的全班人马。她们是由厂里的职工组成的，其中生产工人占半数。
    ②工人们在做工前操。
    ③电工高士祥，曾获得北京市第二届工人运动会男子自行车一万公尺第二名。现在他仍然坚持锻炼，每天早晨上班前骑车由工厂至颐和园往返一次。这是他正在去颐和园的林荫路上。
    ④休息的日子，工人们来到厂内风景优美的九龙山靶场，进行射击练习。
