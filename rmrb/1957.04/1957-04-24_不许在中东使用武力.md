No Use of Force in the Middle East
    By Our Editorial Staff

    The Soviet government, on April 19, once again sent notes to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, advocating that the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France jointly condemn the use of force as a means of resolving unresolved issues in the Near and Middle East. This is another effort by the Soviet Union to ease the tense situation in the Near and Middle East region.

    On February 11 this year, in view of the serious deterioration of the situation in the Near and Middle East due to the United States' attempt to promote the "Eisenhower Doctrine" in the Near and Middle East, the Soviet Union proposed to the United States, Britain, and France that the four major powers jointly formulate and announce a joint declaration on peace and security in the Near and Middle East and on non-interference in the internal affairs of countries in this region. The Soviet Union's proposal was endorsed and supported by the heads of government and people of Asian and African countries, especially Arab countries. However, the imperialist colonial forces, led by the United States, feared that the world in the Near and Middle East would not be chaotic, and feared that agreeing to the Soviet Union's proposal would deprive them of the opportunity to create tension in the region. After a whole month of "consultations," the United States and Britain and France unanimously rejected the Soviet Union's note, once again exposing their aggressive ambitions in the Near and Middle East.

    The Soviet Union's new proposal comes at a time when the situation in the Near and Middle East is becoming increasingly tense due to the United States' intensified aggression. The United States is currently vigorously promoting the "Eisenhower Doctrine" in the Near and Middle East. This doctrine is actually an attempt to enable the United States to use the so-called "communist threat" as an excuse to carry out armed intervention in the Near and Middle East and suppress the local national independence movement at any time. After joining the military committee of the Baghdad Pact, the United States provided a large amount of dollar and weapon assistance to the group in preparation for using the group to carry out military intervention. In order to force Egypt and Syria to submit, the United States, in collusion with Britain and France, exerted various rude pressures on Egypt, and even openly disregarded Egypt's sovereignty over the Gulf of Aqaba. With the support of the imperialists, Israel shamelessly clamored to launch another invasion. The United States' conspiracy to split the unity of Arab countries caused the recent turmoil in Jordan's political situation, and it instigated Israel and the Baghdad Pact countries to seize the opportunity to invade Jordan. Not only that, but the United States recently also clamored that if Jordan is subjected to so-called "aggression," the United States will provide "assistance." This means that the United States will not hesitate to use force to interfere in Jordan's internal affairs. It is very clear that the "policy of strength" implemented by the United States towards Middle Eastern countries striving for independence under the banner of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is the root cause of the tense situation in the Middle East.

    The United States' aggressive activities in the Middle East have been strongly opposed by the people of Middle Eastern countries. The Soviet government's new proposal demonstrates its profound understanding of the Middle East situation and its genuine concern for peace in the Middle East. If the U.S. government wants to prove that it is, as it claims, a so-called friend of the Arab people and is concerned about peace in the Middle East, it has no reason not to accept the Soviet proposal.

    不许在中东使用武力
    本报评论员
    苏联政府4月19日再度照会美英法三国政府，主张由苏、美、英、法四国共同谴责把使用武力作为解决中近东未决问题的手段。这是苏联为和缓中近东地区紧张局势而作的又一次努力。
    今年2月11日，苏联鉴于美国企图在中近东推行
  “艾森豪威尔主义”而使这一地区的局势严重地恶化，曾经向美、英、法三国建议，由四大国共同制定和宣布一项关于中近东和平和安全以及不干涉这一地区国家的内政问题的联合宣言。苏联的这项建议，曾经受到亚非各国，特别是阿拉伯国家政府领袖和人民的赞同和支持。但是以美国为首的帝国主义殖民势力，却唯恐中近东的天下不乱，唯恐同意苏联的建议，就会使它们丧失在这个地区制造紧张局势的机会。经过整整一个月的“磋商”，美国和英法一致拒绝了苏联的照会，从而又一次暴露了它们对中近东的侵略野心。
    现在苏联的这个新建议，是在中近东地区由于美国加强侵略活动而日趋紧张的时候提出的。美国目前正在中近东大力推销“艾森豪威尔主义”。这个主义，实际上就是企图使美国可以在任何时候都利用所谓“共产主义威胁”为借口，对中近东进行武装干涉，镇压当地的民族独立运动。美国在参加巴格达条约集团的军事委员会以后，以大批美元和武器援助这一集团，为利用这个集团进行军事干涉作准备。为了迫使埃及和叙利亚屈服，美国伙同英法向埃及施加了各种粗暴的压力，甚至公然漠视埃及对亚喀巴湾的主权。而以色列在帝国主义者们的支持之下，无耻地叫嚣要重新发动侵略。美国分裂阿拉伯国家团结的阴谋，造成了最近约旦政局的动荡，它又策动以色列和巴格达条约集团国家伺机入侵约旦。不仅如此，美国最近还扬言，如果约旦受到所谓“侵略”，美国将给予“援助”。这就是说，美国将不惜用武力干涉约旦的内政。十分明显，美国在“艾森豪威尔主义”招牌下对争取独立的中东国家所实行的这种“实力政策”，是造成中东局势紧张的根本原因。
    美国在中东的侵略活动，已经遭到中东各国人民的强烈反对。苏联政府的新建议，表明它对于中东局势的深刻理解和对中东和平的真正关怀。美国政府如果要证明它像它自己所说那样是所谓阿拉伯人民的朋友，是所谓关心中东和平的，它就没有任何理由不接受苏联的建议。
