How Much Time Do You Spend Looking in the Mirror in Your Life?
		Chen Jinxiu
    Recently, the supplement of the People's Daily published several articles about mirrors, which aroused my associations.
    Since the advent of bronze mirrors, and their development into modern glass mirrors, for more than two thousand years, they have seen countless beauties and witnessed the passing of time. A Qing Dynasty poet wrote about ancient mirrors:
      “Those of peerless beauty must lament the waning of their looks,
      And the many concubines of the palace have recognized many former faces."
    Since mirrors have become good companions in human daily life, as a modern person, few people go for days or months without looking in a mirror, and it is even rarer for people to go for years or a lifetime without looking in a mirror. The amount of time spent looking in the mirror varies from person to person. I once read in the eighth issue of the first volume of the Women's Monthly published by Women's Bookstore in 1933 a statistic on "Women's Time Spent Looking in the Mirror," which stated: According to a survey by French scientists, the total time each woman spends looking in the mirror, from the age of ten to the age of sixty, is 349,575 minutes, or 242 days. Among them, women aged fifteen to thirty spend the most time looking in the mirror, about twenty-two to thirty minutes per person per day. This small statistic is quite interesting, but unfortunately it lacks statistics on men's time spent looking in the mirror. If we estimate that each person spends an average of five minutes looking in the mirror each day, then a man from the age of ten to sixty will spend at least two months doing so.
    Gu Kaizhi, a famous painter of the Eastern Jin Dynasty, in his posthumous work "Admonitions of the Instructress to the Court Ladies," depicts two women sitting on the floor dressing in front of a mirror, with half a mirror of water caltrop design. The inscription reads, "People all know to adorn their appearance, but few know to cultivate their character..." The painter uses the subject of looking in the mirror, but extends people's attention to appearance to the importance of moral cultivation, and its meaning is even more profound.

    你一生有多少时间对镜？
    陈今修
    最近，人民日报副刊登了几篇关于镜子的文，引起了我的联想。
    自从青铜镜问世，发展到了近代的玻璃镜子，二千多年以来，它看遍了红颜，也阅尽了白发。清代诗人咏古镜有句云：
      “绝代应怜颜色少，六宫曾识故人多”。
    镜子既然成为人类日常生活的良友，作为一个现代人来讲，当然很少有几天或经月不对镜的人，更难有终年或一生不对镜的人。对镜的时间，因人而异。偶阅1933年女子书店出版的女子月刊第一卷第八期载有一则“妇女照镜时间”，内云：据法国科学家的调查结果，每个妇女一生对镜，自十岁女孩起算，至六十岁老妇止，共计为三十四万九千五百七十五分钟，即二百四十二天。其中以十五岁至三十岁的女性对镜时间为最多，每天每人需二十二分至三十分左右。这则小统计颇有趣味，可惜缺少关于男子对镜时间的统计。如果试以每人每天照镜时间平均五分钟来估计，那末，一个男性从十岁起至六十岁止，至少也要花上两个月的时间哩。
    东晋时代名画家顾恺之在他的遗作“女史箴图卷”中，绘有两个妇人席地对镜梳装，菱花半面，题有“人咸知修其容，莫知饰其性……”。画家以对镜为题材，却把人们对于仪表的注意，引伸到品质修养的重要性方面去，其涵意自更深长了。
