Asanuma Inejirō's Statement

To Mr. Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, and friends of the People's Republic of China:

Thank you very much for coming to welcome us. We eight people are very happy to be able to visit your country as a goodwill delegation of the Japan Socialist Party with the help of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs. I would like to say a few words to Chinese friends at this beautiful Beijing airport on behalf of the delegation.

First of all, as a socialist, I deeply reflect on the inadequacy of my own strength because the forces of democracy, pacifism, and socialism in Japan were extremely weak and failed to prevent that terrible war in advance, which caused your country to suffer indescribable disasters. We firmly believe that this is also the will of the Japanese people.

I sincerely congratulate you on your solid unity under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the completion of the socialist transformation, and the steady progress of socialist construction.

The path that we Japanese have taken after the war has also been full of hardships. There are still many problems that must be solved. However, in Japan today, there is a growing awareness of the responsibility for the war, and the forces defending independence, freedom, and peace are growing. This force has developed to the point where it can prevent attempts to maliciously revise the democratic and peaceful constitution, which is based on popular sovereignty, the renunciation of war, and the upholding of basic human rights. I believe Chinese friends will be happy about this.

The Socialist Party of Japan made a resolution at its 13th Congress in January of this year: Although twelve years have passed since the end of the war, the relations between the two countries, which have not ended the state of war in violation of the will of the people of both countries, should be resolved as soon as possible and diplomatic relations with your country should be restored as soon as possible.

Therefore, we hope that through our visit to your country, we can exchange views frankly on important issues existing between the two countries, deepen mutual understanding, and further promote friendly and amicable relations.

Moreover, we hope that this visit will help to further strengthen the people-to-people exchanges and economic and cultural exchanges that the people of the two countries have accumulated bit by bit while overcoming many difficulties in the past, and that it can develop into a formal agreement between the two governments to restore diplomatic relations.

During the next two weeks of our stay in your country, I think we will add a lot of trouble to you, please take care of us.

    浅沼稻次郎的声明
    中国人民外交学会会长张奚若先生以及中华人民共和国的朋友们：
    承蒙你们前来欢迎，非常感谢。我们八个人能在中国人民外交学会的帮助下，作为日本社会党访华亲善使节团前来贵国访问，感到十分高兴。我愿意在这个美丽的北京机场，代表使节团向中国朋友们讲几句话。
    首先，我们要对于因日本的民主主义、和平主义以及社会主义的势力极端微弱而未能事先阻止那个可怕的战争，以致使贵国的诸位遭受了用言语难以形容的灾难，作为一个社会主义者，深刻反省自己力量的不足。我们深信这也是日本人民的意愿。
    我衷心祝贺你们巩固地团结在毛泽东主席的领导下，完成了社会主义改造，并正在稳步地进行着社会主义建设。
    我们日本人战后所走的道路也是充满着苦难的。现在也还存在着许多必须解决的问题。但是目前在日本，已痛感到对战争应负有责任，保卫独立、自由与和平的势力正在日益增长，这种力量已发展成足以阻止企图恶劣地修改以主权在民、放弃战争、拥护基本人权为基本内容的民主和平宪法的力量。我相信中国朋友们一定会为此而高兴。
    我社会党在今年1月召开的第十三次大会做出了决议：战争结束后虽已经过十二年，但违背了两国人民的意志，还没有结束战争状态的两国关系应早日解决并尽早恢复与贵国的邦交。
    因此，我们希望通过我们这次访问贵国，就两国之间所存在的重要问题，毫无隔阂地交换意见，并加深两国互相之间的了解，进一步促进友好亲善关系。
    而且期望通过这次访问，能有助于把过去两国人民之间排除许多困难而一点一滴地积累起来的人们间的往来及经济、文化的交流更进一步加强，并能发展到两国政府之间正式签订恢复邦交的协定。
    在今后的两个星期中，在贵国逗留，我想会增添各位很多麻烦的，请各位多照顾。
