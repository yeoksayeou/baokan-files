    Don't Marry Too Early
    In some villages in Quan County, Guangxi Province, the Marriage Law has not been well implemented in recent years, and many girls have married before reaching the minimum age for marriage. For example, in Qingshui Village, many girls became mothers at the age of sixteen or seventeen, and now you can't find a girl over eighteen years old in this village. Some young women were very active in participating in labor production and studying culture before marriage, but after marriage, they relaxed their production and study due to the burden of housework and children. Some young women are very distressed because they don't know how to take care of their children.

    It is hoped that relevant departments will strengthen the publicity of the Marriage Law in rural areas, explain the harms of early marriage to farmers, and strictly prohibit young men and women under the age of eighteen and twenty from marrying.

### 不要过早结婚

    不要过早结婚
    广西省全县有些乡村，几年来，没有很好地执行婚姻法，许多姑娘还未到起码的结婚年龄就结了婚。如清水村有许多姑娘十六、七岁就做了母亲，现在在这个村子里找不出一个十八岁以上的姑娘。有些年青的妇女婚前参加劳动生产、学习文化都很积极，但婚后受家务和孩子的拖累，就放松了生产和学习。有些青年妇女因为不会带孩子，精神很苦恼。
    希望有关部门在农村中加强婚姻法的宣传工作，向农民讲解早婚的害处，并严格制止不满十八周岁和二十周岁的青年男女结婚。
