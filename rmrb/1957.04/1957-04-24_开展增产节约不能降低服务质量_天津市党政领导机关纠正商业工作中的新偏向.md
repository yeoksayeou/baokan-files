Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, April 23rd (Xinhua Reporter Huang Jun): A small number of units in Tianjin's commercial sector have neglected service quality and even harmed consumers' interests in the production increase and economy practice campaign. The Tianjin Municipal Party Committee and relevant government departments have begun to correct this deviation.

A few restaurants under the Tianjin Catering Company once canceled the coriander for customers to use in soup and the garlic for eating dumplings and buns. Some even hid the vinegar bottles, thinking this was saving money. According to a survey by this company in the Hebei and Heping districts, one-sixth to one-fifth of the breakfast stalls sold lower quality baked wheat cakes, fried dough sticks, and soy milk. In order to save oil, flour, and soybeans, they made the baked wheat cakes smaller, the soy milk thinner, and the specifications for fried dough sticks, which were originally stipulated as "nine inches long, one tael in weight, and old red in color," became "seven inches long, eight qian in weight, and light yellow in color." Individual stores under the Tianjin branch of the China Vegetable and Food Grocery Company even mixed water into shrimp soy sauce; some stores gave short weight when selling oil. According to a survey in the Nankai district, more than eighty oil shops and oil vendors made an extra six hundred jin of oil in one month by deducting weight. Some salespersons in the colored cloth counter of the Heping Road Department Store measured the cloth very tightly when selling it, once giving two inches less when selling fifteen feet of bleached cloth. In order to save the hemp rope used for packaging, the enamelware counter only tied one knot when selling washbasins at one point, and as soon as the customer took it away, the rope came loose and the washbasin was dropped and broken. Some stores simply turned off all the lighting in the display cases during the day to save electricity, resulting in insufficient lighting at night. Some customers complained that they could not see the patterns on colorful clothes or the colors of the colored cloth clearly.

According to the analysis of the leading departments of relevant industries, the reason for the above deviations is first of all that some enterprises and units did not emphasize the need to improve service quality enough while carrying out the production increase and economy practice campaign, and some employees did not sufficiently recognize the consistency between the two, so they did not consolidate the "Good Service Campaign" that had been carried out very well during the Spring Festival. Secondly, some units simply put forward the target of completing savings to the stores, lacking appropriate specific measures. The stores mainly focused on finding ways to save money and ignored ensuring service quality.

After discovering these deviations, the Finance and Trade Department of the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee and the relevant commercial bureaus of the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee instructed each company to check and correct them. The Tianjin Catering Company and the Vegetable and Food Grocery Company held employee meetings and technical exchange meetings, and formulated measures to improve service quality. The Heping Road Department Store held an exhibition to introduce the advanced deeds of employees who correctly carried out production increase and economy practice to the salespersons. The departments of the shopping mall organized inspection teams or designated special personnel to regularly check whether the salespersons' practices in implementing the savings plan harmed the interests of consumers. The Finance and Trade Department of the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee also focused on solving this problem when conducting policy and ideological education for commercial employees in the city recently.

### 开展增产节约不能降低服务质量  天津市党政领导机关纠正商业工作中的新偏向

    开展增产节约不能降低服务质量
    天津市党政领导机关纠正商业工作中的新偏向
    新华社天津23日电　新华社记者黄军报道：天津市商业部门有少数单位在增产节约运动中忽视服务质量，甚至损害消费者的利益。中共天津市委和政府有关部门已着手纠正这一偏向。
    天津市饮食公司所属的少数饭馆，曾经取消了顾客吃汤用的香菜和吃饺子、包子用的大蒜，有的还把醋瓶子藏起来，认为这就是节约。据这个公司在河北、和平两个区调查，有六分之一到五分之一的早点铺，出售的烧饼、油条、豆浆降低了质量，他们为了省油、省面、省豆子，把烧饼做小了，豆浆稀了，油条的规格原来规定是“九寸长、一两重、老红色”，现在变成“七寸长、八钱重、淡黄色”了。中国蔬菜食品杂货公司天津市公司所属的个别商店，竟在虾酱油里掺水；有些店卖油时分量不足，据南开区调查，八十多户油店和油摊贩由于扣秤，在一个月内多出油六百多斤。百货公司和平路商店色布柜的有些售货员，在卖布时尺寸量得很紧，有一次出售十五尺漂布就少给了二寸。搪瓷柜为节省包装用的麻绳，在一次卖脸盆时，只扎了一道，顾客刚一拿走，绳子就脱开，脸盆被掉在地上摔坏了。有的商店单纯为了节约用电，夜晚灯光不足，白天把柜台里的照明电灯全部关上，有的顾客反映：花衣服看不出花来，色布看不清颜色。
    据有关行业的领导部门分析，产生上述偏向的原因首先是有些企业单位在开展增产节约运动的同时，对要提高服务质量强调不够，一些职工对这两者之间的一致性认识不足，因而没有把在春节期间曾经开展得很好的“服务良好运动”巩固下来。其次是有些单位简单地向商店提出完成节约的指标，缺乏恰当的具体措施，商店主要地是在想办法节省钱，而忽略了保证服务质量。
    中共天津市委财贸部及天津市人民委员会的有关各商业局发现这些偏向以后，已责成各公司检查纠正。天津市饮食公司和蔬菜食品杂货公司召开了职工大会和技术交流会议，订出了提高服务质量的措施。百货公司和平路商店举办展览会，向售货员介绍了职工中正确进行增产节约的先进事迹，商场各科组织了检查小组或指定专人，定期检查售货员在执行节约计划中有没有损害消费者利益的作法。中共天津市委财贸部最近在对全市商业职工进行政策思想教育的时候，也着重地解决这一问题。
