    Factory Manufacturing Tiles
    Lin Chengxing
    There is a factory manufacturing tiles in Xishan, a suburb of Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province—the Xishan Ceramic Factory.

    The tiles produced by the Xishan Ceramic Factory are white, strong, and have smooth, flat surfaces. Its annual output accounts for about three-quarters of the total national output.

    The Xishan Ceramic Factory was established in 1939 and became a joint state-private enterprise in September 1951. Before the joint venture, the factory mainly produced porcelain for daily use, such as plates, bowls, and electrical appliances. After the joint venture, according to the needs of national construction, the factory gradually increased the production of architectural ceramics. Last year, the workers successfully trial-produced thin porcelain tiles with a thickness of five millimeters. This new variety is of better quality, saves raw materials, has lower costs, and is more convenient for transportation than the original seven-millimeter-thick variety. Now, the factory is entirely producing this type of thin porcelain tile. This year, six more kilns will be expanded, and it is expected that they will be put into production in the third quarter.

    Before liberation, China's architectural ceramics were all imported. Now, Xishan tiles are not only sold throughout the country but are also exported to more than ten countries and regions, including North Korea, Vietnam, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Ceylon, the United Kingdom, and Lebanon. This year, the factory plans to produce more than 22 million pieces of architectural ceramics, an increase of 62% compared to last year, of which about 70% will be exported.

    Wenzhou's ceramic clay is abundant, and the Xishan Ceramic Factory is located in a place with convenient land and water transportation. Farmers from various counties transport raw materials to the factory year-round.

    制造瓷砖的工厂
    林承兴
    浙江省温州市郊西山，有一座制造瓷砖的工厂——西山陶瓷厂。
    西山陶瓷厂生产的瓷砖，颜色洁白，坚固，砖面光滑平正，每年产量约占全国总产量的四分之三。
    西山陶瓷厂创建于1939年，1951年9月实行公私合营。合营前，这个厂主要生产日用盘碗以及电料等瓷器。合营后，根据国家建设需要，这个厂逐步增加建筑用瓷。去年工人们试制成功五公厘厚的薄瓷砖，这种新品种比原来七公厘厚的品种质量好，原料省，成本低，运输也方便。现在这个厂全部生产这种薄瓷砖了。今年还将扩建六个窑，预计在第三季度投入生产。
    解放前我国建筑用瓷都是采用进口货。现在，西山瓷砖不但行销全国各地，而且远销朝鲜、越南、埃及、印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、锡兰、英国、黎巴嫩等十多个国家。今年这个厂计划生产建筑用瓷两千两百多万块，比去年增产62％，其中将有70％左右远销国外。
    温州的陶瓷土蕴藏丰富，西山陶瓷厂所在的地方水陆运输便利，各县农民终年不绝地为这个厂运送原料。
