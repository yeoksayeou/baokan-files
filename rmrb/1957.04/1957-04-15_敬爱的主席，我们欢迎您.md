To the respected Chairman Voroshilov:
    Hello!
    As early as two months ago, we learned that you would be visiting our country in mid-April. We were extremely happy! Extremely excited! Anticipating, anticipating! You have finally arrived amidst our joyful cheers. Respected Chairman Voroshilov: Please allow us to greet you in your language, to express our highest respect and warmest welcome!
    Respected Chairman Voroshilov: From the days we began to remember things, we knew about the Soviet Union, and we also knew your name. How admirable your heroic posture was in the stormy revolutionary years of 1905; How admirable your outstanding military command talent and heroic spirit were in the battle to defend Tsaritsyn during the precarious domestic war years; In the Patriotic War that reversed the fate of human history, as one of the commanders of the Soviet Red Army, you established outstanding meritorious service for the Soviet people and the cause of world peace. And today, respected Chairman Voroshilov, we can personally meet you in our own country, pay our respects to you, and listen to your teachings, ah! How excited our young hearts should be!
    Respected Chairman Voroshilov: You have come with the great friendship of the Soviet people. We, these more than five thousand young people studying the Russian language, have deeply experienced the precious friendship of the Soviet people in our daily life and study.
    Respected Chairman Voroshilov: The Beijing Russian Language Institute was just a Russian language school with several hundred students seven or eight years ago. Since the arrival of Soviet experts, the school's appearance has undergone tremendous changes, and today it has become a specialized higher education institution with fairly complete facilities and more than five thousand students. Thanks to the enthusiastic help and personal guidance of Soviet experts, the Beijing Russian Language Institute has successively trained thousands of teaching assistants, lecturers, and translation staff; and we, these children who originally did not know the Russian alphabet, are now able to read the original works of Pushkin, Tolstoy, and Gorky, as well as the original works of Lenin. In our contact with Soviet teachers, we encounter moving events that reflect the noble internationalist spirit of Soviet comrades every day. We have clearly seen the excellent qualities of the Soviet people from Soviet teachers, and we have seen the selfless help and brotherly care of the Soviet people for our country's socialist construction. We are also growing up under their correct cultivation.
    Respected Chairman Voroshilov: You will be very happy to hear that we have maintained close contact with Soviet youth. We often correspond with Soviet university students in Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Siberia, and other places, exchanging gifts with each other. From their enthusiastic letters, we learn about the labor and life of the Soviet people, and we learn about the Soviet people's friendly wishes and concern for us.
    Respected Chairman Voroshilov: We are proud to learn Russian, because we can directly see the magnificent picture of Soviet communist construction from Russian newspapers and periodicals every day. We regard every achievement and victory in Soviet construction as our own achievement and victory. The interests of the Chinese and Soviet people cannot be separated. It is precisely because of this that we gratefully see how many Soviet experts are making great friendly efforts on all fronts of our country's industrial, agricultural, cultural, and educational undertakings.
    Respected Chairman Voroshilov: In the recent year of international life, we have deeply realized the significance of the great Soviet Union to world peace. It was the Soviet Union that helped the Hungarian working people defend the fruits of socialism, and it was also the Soviet Union that effectively stopped the crimes of the British and French imperialists in their aggression against Egypt. At present, when the aggressive bloc headed by US imperialism is still continuing to carry out activities to undermine peace, we must stand better with the Soviet people and fight to maintain world peace. We must, together with Soviet youth, inherit the cause and unyielding spirit of our revolutionary predecessors, and strive to develop and consolidate Sino-Soviet friendship, strengthen the unity of the socialist camp, and seek lasting world peace.
    Respected Chairman Voroshilov: Please accept our welcome and respect to you once again! Please convey our gratitude to the Soviet people! Please convey our best wishes to Soviet youth on our behalf.
        Wishing you good health!
                                Respectfully, All Students of Beijing Russian Language Institute

专栏：

    敬爱的主席，我们欢迎您敬爱的伏罗希洛夫主席：
    您好！
    早在两个月以前，我们就知道了您将于4月中旬访问我国的消息。我们高兴极了！兴奋极了！期待呀，期待啊！您终于在我们的欢乐声中来到了。敬爱的伏罗希洛夫主席：请允许我们用你们的语言向您问候，向您表示最崇高的敬意和最热烈的欢迎！
    敬爱的伏罗希洛夫主席：从我们记事的日子起，我们就知道了苏联，也就知道了您的名字。您在暴风雨般的1905年的革命年代中的英姿多么令人敬仰；您在千钧一发的国内战争年代保卫察里津的战役中那卓越的军事指挥天才和英勇精神多么令人钦佩；在那扭转人类历史命运的卫国战争年代，作为苏联红军统帅之一，您为苏联人民和世界和平事业建立了卓绝的功勋。而今天，敬爱的伏罗希洛夫主席，我们能在自己的国土上亲自和您见面，向您致敬，聆听您的教诲，啊！我们这年青的心，该是多么的激动呀！
    敬爱的伏罗希洛夫主席：您是带着苏联人民的伟大友谊来的。我们这五千多名学习俄罗斯语言的青年，在日常的生活和学习中，已经深深体会到了苏联人民的珍贵的友谊。
    敬爱的伏罗希洛夫主席：北京俄语学院在七、八年以前还不过是一所数百人的俄文学校。自从苏联专家来了以后，学校的面貌就起了日新月异的变化，而今天已经成为一所设备相当完善、拥有五千多名学生的专业性高等学院了。由于苏联专家的热心帮助和亲自教导，北京俄语学院先后已经培养了数以千计的助教、讲师和翻译工作干部；而我们这些原来不认识俄文字母的孩子，今天已经能够阅读普希金、托尔斯泰和高尔基的原著以及列宁的原著。在和苏联老师的接触当中，我们每天都会遇到反映了苏联同志崇高的国际主义精神的动人事件。我们从苏联老师身上清楚地看到了苏联人民的优秀品质，看到了苏联人民对我国社会主义建设事业大公无私的帮助和兄弟般的关怀。我们也正是他们正在确的培养下成长起来的。
    敬爱的伏罗希洛夫主席：您听到一定会很高兴吧，我们和苏联青年一直保持着亲密的联系。我们和莫斯科、列宁格勒、基辅、西伯利亚等地的苏联大学生经常通讯，互赠礼品，从他们的热情的信件当中，我们了解到了苏联人民的劳动和生活，了解到了苏联人民对我们的友好愿望和关怀。
    敬爱的伏罗希洛夫主席：我们为学习俄语而感到骄傲，因为我们每天都能直接地从俄文报刊上看到苏联的共产主义建设的宏伟图景。我们把苏联建设中的每一个成就和胜利都当成是自己的成就和胜利。中苏两国人民的利益是不能分开的，正是这样，我们感激地看到多少苏联专家们正在我国的工业、农业、文化教育事业的各条战线上付出巨大的友谊的劳动。
    敬爱的伏罗希洛夫主席：在最近一年的国际生活当中，我们深深体会到伟大的苏联对世界和平的意义。帮助匈牙利劳动人民保卫社会主义果实的是苏联，有力地制止了英法帝国主义侵略埃及的罪行的也是苏联。目前正当以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团仍在继续进行破坏和平的活动的时候，我们要更好地和苏联人民站在一起，为维护世界和平而斗争。我们一定和苏联青年一道，继承革命前辈的事业和不屈不挠的精神，为发展和巩固中苏友谊和加强社会主义阵营的团结，为谋求世界持久和平而奋斗。
    敬爱的伏罗希洛夫主席：请再次接受我们对您的欢迎和敬意！请您转达我们对苏联人民的感谢！请您代我们向苏联青年表示最好的祝愿。
        祝　您身体健康！
                              北京俄语学院全体学生敬上
