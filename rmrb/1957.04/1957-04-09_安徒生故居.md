Hans Christian Andersen's Former Residence
Chen Dayuan

    This is a beautiful city, a quiet river flowing through it. The banks are lined with trees, including red-leaved maples, sparse white birches, and long, water-grazing willows. White swans float on the water, fluffy gray cygnets following behind, just like the ugly duckling Andersen described in his fairy tale. They are not afraid of people, as if enjoying the tranquility of their own world. The river circles around the city center, and the open grass on both banks becomes a small park.
    Some of the things in the small park have many connections with Andersen. A Dane told me that Andersen often followed his mother to this river to wash clothes when he was very young. Wild swans and ugly ducklings awakened his beautiful fantasies; trees and rivers became objects of his fairy tale descriptions.
    To commemorate Andersen, a bronze statue of Andersen was erected next to the river in the small park a few years ago. Opposite it is a bronze sculpture based on Andersen's fairy tale "The Wild Swans." Elisa is sleeping on the backs of eleven wild swans, flying into the sky.
    Therefore, people call this place "Andersen Park."
    This beautiful city is Andersen's hometown—Odense.
    The shadow of Andersen's childhood is deeply rooted in people's memories. When they see a foreigner, they often automatically introduce Andersen and take pride in him. They talk about Andersen's childhood so vividly, as if they had all lived with Andersen.
    A Danish friend led me to the entrance of a theater, pointing to this rather antique building and saying, "When Andersen was a child, he was hired by this theater to put up posters for them."
    I saw a painting: Andersen's father is repairing shoes, his grandmother is telling him stories, and the dim light shines on the thin face of young Andersen, who is already immersed in his grandmother's stories.
    These fairy-tale-like legends made the shadow of a young Andersen emerge in my mind. The poor and thin Andersen was just like an "ugly duckling." Yes, disaster and a life of begging made him ugly. But it was precisely these things that cleansed his soul and made him as beautiful as a swan.
    Andersen's former residence, which is also the place where he was born, is in a narrow alley with an old-fashioned atmosphere. The pointed-roofed red house is very small, but very prominent. This small house is connected to several large exhibition rooms with mismatched styles.
    The small house is as narrow as a corridor. It is impossible to know where Andersen was born, where he lived, where he wrote, or where his father's workshop was. On both sides of a large, newly built hall, the furnishings of Andersen's living room during his lifetime are displayed. It is said that this was arranged according to the memory of one of Andersen's maids. The utensils are very simple, and the most eye-catching is a screen with beautiful floral patterns, which were cut and pasted together from pictorials. Figures, landscapes, birds, and animals are cleverly combined to become a magnificent patchwork. The administrator said that this was made by Andersen himself.
    In the exhibition room, you can see many small and interesting things: Andersen's paper cuttings, humorous and full of imagination. He drew many sketches, and the technique does not seem to be very good, but it looks bright and refreshing. There are also the strange pictures he drew for the children, the dried grass flowers pressed in books, and so on. It seems that Andersen was very interested in his environment and everything he came into contact with, and used various methods to express them and record them.
    In a small room, Andersen's belongings are displayed: hats, suitcases, canes, and a thick rope. The administrator said that these were all Andersen's travel supplies. The thick rope was a tool that Andersen prepared to save his life in case of fire or robbery on the train or ship. Probably Andersen was a very humorous person.
    There are also some of Andersen's manuscripts, which are very precious, but unfortunately, most of them are soaked, mildewed, and the handwriting is blurred. The exhibition room upstairs stores more than sixty kinds of language versions of Andersen's fairy tales, including those published in China.
    The central round hall is painted with eight murals, narrating Andersen's experience. The last picture depicts the scene of Andersen being awarded the title of "Honorary Citizen": Andersen leans out of the city hall, and thousands of people on the square hold torches and cheer for Andersen.
    After visiting Andersen's former residence, I visited the mayor and the city hall, the hall where Andersen was cheered. However, there are no traces of it, and no one can tell what happened at that time. I only compared it here with the mural: the building opposite and the church on the side are exactly the same as those painted on the mural. Whether it is maintaining the old appearance or reflecting on the past, my requirements are finally met.
    Why did Andersen receive the cheers of millions of people? A Danish friend replied: Andersen sympathized with the people's experiences and enriched people's imaginations.

    安徒生故居
    陈大远
    这是一个美丽的城市，清幽的小河，从城市当中穿流而过。两岸长着许多树木，有红叶的丹枫，有疏疏落落的白桦，有长条拂水的垂柳。洁白的天鹅在水上浮游，毛绒绒的灰色小天鹅跟在后面，正像安徒生在童话里所描写的丑小鸭。它们不怕人，好像在享受着自己的世界的清幽。河水在城市的中心绕了一个圈子，两岸的草地显得空阔，这里就成为一个小小的公园。
    小公园的一些事物，和安徒生有着很多联系。一个丹麦人告诉我：安徒生在很小的时候，常常跟随他的母亲，到这条小河里来洗衣服。野天鹅、丑小鸭，都曾唤起了他的美丽的幻想；树木、河水，都曾成为他的童话描述的对象。
    为了纪念安徒生，几年前，在小公园的河旁竖立起一个安徒生的铜像，它的对面还有一个铜雕，是根据安徒生的童话“野天鹅”的故事雕塑的。艾丽莎睡在十一只野天鹅的背上，飞向天空。
    因此，人们就把这里叫作“安徒生公园”。
    这个美丽的城市就是安徒生的故乡——奥顿斯。
    安徒生幼年的影子，在人们的记忆中是很深的。他们看到一个外国人，常常自动地介绍安徒生，引为骄傲。讲起安徒生的童年，讲得非常生动，好像他们都和安徒生一起生活过。
    丹麦朋友领我到一个剧院门口，指着这个颇有古风的建筑物说：“当安徒生还是小孩子的时候，曾经受雇于这个剧院，给他们贴海报”。
    我看到一幅画：安徒生的父亲在修理皮鞋，祖母给他讲故事，幽暗的灯光照耀着幼年的安徒生的瘦削的脸，他已经浸沉在祖母的故事里了。
    这些童话似的传说，使我的脑子里浮现出一个幼年的安徒生的影子。穷困瘦削的安徒生，正像一个“丑小鸭”吧。是的，灾难，求乞的生活使他丑。但是，正是这些，洗净了他的灵魂，使他像天鹅一样美丽。
    安徒生的故居，也就是他出生的地方，在一条带着古老味道的狭窄的胡同里。尖顶的红房子，很矮小，但是很突出。这个小房子接连着几间高大的、格调不大相称的陈列室。
    那栋小房子里，狭窄得像一条走廊。到底安徒生生在哪里，住在哪里，哪里是他写作的地方，哪里是他父亲的作坊，已经没法知道了。在一间宽大的后建的厅堂两侧，陈列着安徒生生前住室的陈设。据说，这是根据安徒生的一个女仆的记忆布置起来的。用具很简单，最惹人注意的是一架屏风，屏风上有美丽的花纹图案，那是从画报上剪下粘贴在一起的。人像，山水，鸟兽，巧妙地凑合起来，成为洋洋大观的百衲图。管理员说，这是安徒生手制的。
    在陈列室里可以看见许多细小有趣的东西，安徒生的剪纸，幽默而富于想像。他画了许多速写，技巧似乎并不高明，但是看起来明快、爽朗。还有他给孩子们画的奇奇怪怪的图画，在书本里压干了的草花，等等。好像安徒生对他的环境，对他所接触到的东西，都发生过很大的兴趣，用各种方法来表现它们，纪录它们。
    在一个小屋子里，陈列着安徒生的遗物：帽子、皮箱、手杖，还有一条粗大的绳子。管理员说，这都是安徒生旅行的用具。那条粗绳，是安徒生准备在车船失火、被劫时用来救命的工具。大概安徒生是个很有风趣的人。
    还有安徒生的一些手稿，这是很珍贵的东西，可惜大多浸湿发霉字迹模糊了。楼上的陈列室储藏着六十多种文字版本的安徒生童话集，也有中国出版的。
    中央的圆厅画着八幅壁画，叙述着安徒生的经历。最后一幅，描画了安徒生被授予“荣誉公民”的场面：安徒生从市政大厅探出头来，广场上成千的人，拿着火炬，向安徒生欢呼。
    参观了安徒生故居之后，我拜访了市长先生，参观了市政大厅，安徒生曾在这里受过欢呼的大厅。但是，一点遗迹也没有，而且谁也讲不出当时的情况。我只在这里和那幅壁画对照了一下：对面的楼房和侧面的教堂，和壁画上画的完全一样，不管是旧观未改还是抚今追昔，我的要求总算有所满足了。
    为什么安徒生获得了千万人的欢呼？丹麦朋友回答说：安徒生同情了人民的遭遇，丰富了人们的想像。
