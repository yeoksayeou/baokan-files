Xinhua News Agency, April 4th: Mrs. Eugénie Cotton, President of the Women's International Democratic Federation, recently sent a letter to the Chairman of the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee, stating: "At the moment when the Disarmament Subcommittee is about to hold a meeting, I come to express to you the strong hope of millions of women from all countries in the world for its success."

"Women want peace and no longer wish to see wars that have caused them so many sacrifices and so much suffering."

"Currently, they feel uneasy when they see the international tensions increasing and the policies of military blocs re-emerging."

Mrs. Cotton then condemned in her letter those governments that verbally praise disarmament but in fact intensify the arms race. She said: "People have even rearmed a country that was disarmed by the Allies in the Second World War, and this disarmament was once considered by the people of all countries as the first step towards universal disarmament." Mrs. Cotton also condemned those who are conducting thermonuclear tests, saying: "The thermonuclear tests themselves are a danger to the normal life of mankind."

Mrs. Cotton concluded in her letter: "It is beneficial for the Disarmament Subcommittee to understand the current deep aspirations of the people of all countries. Therefore, I am willing to fulfill my responsibility to express to you the desire for peace of millions of women and mothers united in the Women's International Democratic Federation. These women have not forgotten the forty million people who died in the Second World War. They earnestly request the Disarmament Subcommittee to take concrete measures to achieve practical disarmament. They especially demand an agreement on the prohibition of atomic weapons and the immediate cessation of thermonuclear tests."

    千百万妇女恳切希望裁军
    国际民主妇联主席致函裁军小组会
    要求立即就停止氢弹试验达成协议
    据新华社4日讯　国际民主妇联主席欧仁妮·戈登夫人最近给联合国裁军小组委员会主席的一封信，信中说：“在裁军小组委员会即将举行会议的时刻，我来向您表达世界各国的千百万妇女对于它的成功所寄予的强烈希望。”
    “妇女们要和平，不愿再看到使她们遭受那么多的牺牲、带来那么大的痛苦的战争。”
    “目前当她们看到国际紧张局势增张、军事集团政策重新出现的时候，她们感到很不安。”
    戈登夫人接着在信中谴责了那些在口头上称赞裁军，但事实上却加紧军备竞赛的政府。她说：“人们甚至于把第二次世界大战被盟国解除了武装的一个国家重新武装起来了，而这种解除武装曾经被各国人民认为是走向普遍裁军的第一步。”戈登夫人在信中还谴责了那些正在进行着热核子试验的人们，她说：“仅仅热核子试验本身对人类的正常生活就是一个危险。”
    戈登夫人最后在信中说：“裁军小组委员会了解各国人民目前的深切愿望是有好处的。为此，我愿意负起我的职责，向你们表达团结在国际民主妇女联合会中的千百万妇女和母亲对于和平的愿望。这些妇女没有忘记在第二次大战中死去的四千万人。她们恳切要求裁军小组委员会为达成实际的裁军而采取具体措施。她们特别要求就禁止原子武器并立即停止热核子试验达成协议。”
