Chairman Cyrankiewicz's Speech at the Welcome Meeting of Tianjin Higher Education Institutions

Respected professors and teachers! Dear young friends!

The delegation of the Polish people sincerely thanks you for the warm welcome!

I now convey to you the most heartfelt respect of the Polish youth!

The vast majority of Polish youth are also studying in schools, preparing to become engineers and technicians of the country to help the Polish people eliminate the country's backwardness, a backwardness caused by more than one hundred and fifty years of national subjugation.

China is a very good example for us in building the country and developing the cause of socialism.

Our stay in China is very short, only a few days; but we have fully seen the enormity of China's construction scale and the new life of the Chinese people.

I am particularly excited to speak to the young students in this city where Premier Zhou Enlai once studied and spent his youth, in this city where Premier Zhou Enlai was once arrested for fighting for freedom.

Just now, on our way from our residence here, Comrade Zhou Enlai told me in the car: this used to be a wilderness, but now new houses have been built. He told me: in the past, this was wasteland and that was waterlogged land; there were also foreign concessions in the city. At that time, the Chinese Communist Party was already fighting for the liberation of the motherland. This struggle was a long struggle, which the Polish people paid close attention to and were very concerned about and sympathetic to. The Polish people also knew that this struggle was very cruel and the sacrifices were great. However, the correct cause finally won, China has gained freedom, and now China is advancing by leaps and bounds.

Because of the correctness of the road pointed out by the Chinese Communist Party, and because of the liberation struggle carried out by China, these wastelands and waterlogged lands have finally become the universities they are today. Precisely because of this, you can study here; precisely because of this, you can be called engineers and technicians in the future to build your motherland.

We Polish people are very excited and very happy to see you achieve victory on the road of development. Because we believe that the victories and successes you have achieved in building socialism are our victories and successes.

Poland is a small country with a small population of only twenty-eight million. Without the socialist family, Poland would not be able to defend its independence or carry out socialist construction as a country alone.

Precisely because of this, we are working hard to strengthen friendship and unity with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries.

Precisely because of this, we feel very close to the Chinese people; we also feel very close to the Chinese Communist Party.

We came here from Poland to express the great friendship of the Polish people to the Chinese people; to express the Polish people's solidarity with China's socialist construction and the struggle to defend world peace.

Respected teachers! Young people! I wish you all the best in your work and study! Everything goes smoothly!

Dear young friends! Just as Polish youth are the future of Poland, you are the future of the People's China. Today, China is a free country, a great country. This is because for decades, Chinese comrades, the older generation of fighters who fought for the liberation of the motherland, have created a path of liberation for China; the Chinese Party has also grown stronger as a result of gaining various experiences.

But what will People's China be like in ten, fifteen, or twenty years? That depends on you, on the work of you new engineers, technicians and new intellectuals.

I salute you young people - the future of People's China! I wish you the best results in your studies! I hope you can fulfill the tasks that the youth of socialist countries should fulfill!

Long live Chinese youth!

Long live Sino-Polish friendship!

Long live People's China!

Long live the unity of socialist countries!

Long live world peace!

### 在天津市高等学校的欢迎会上  西伦凯维兹主席的演说

    在天津市高等学校的欢迎会上
    西伦凯维兹主席的演说尊敬的教授们、教师们：亲爱的青年朋友们：
    波兰人民的代表团衷心地感谢你们所给予的热烈的欢迎！
    我现在将波兰青年们对你们的最衷心的敬意转达给你们！
    绝大多数的波兰青年，也是在学校里学习，他们准备成为国家的工程师、技师，来帮助波兰的人民消除国家的落后状况；这种落后状况是由于在一百五十多年来的亡国状况中造成的。
    在建设国家、发展社会主义事业方面，中国对我们来说，是一个很好的典范。
    我们在中国逗留的时间还很短，只有几天；但我们已充分地看到中国建设规模的巨大，看到中国人民的新的生活。
    在这个周恩来总理曾经学习过、并且度过青年时代的城市，在这个周恩来总理为了争取自由曾经被逮捕过的城市里向青年学生们讲话，我感到特别兴奋。
    刚才在我们由住的地方到这里来的时候，周恩来同志在汽车里告诉我：这里过去还是荒野，但现在已盖起新的房子来了。他告诉我：在过去，这里是荒田，那里是水地；在城市里还有外国租界地。在那个时候，中国共产党就已经在为争取祖国的解放而进行斗争。这个斗争是个长期的斗争，波兰人民非常注意，并且非常关心和同情这个斗争，波兰人民同时也知道这个斗争是很残酷的，牺牲是很大的。但是，正确的事业终于获得胜利了，中国已经获得了自由，现在中国正在大踏步地前进。
    由于中国共产党所指出的道路的正确，由于中国所进行的解放斗争，这些荒田和水地终于变成了现在的大学。正因为此，你们才能在这里学习；正因为此，你们将来才可以称为工程师、技师，来建设你们的祖国。
    我们波兰人民在看到你们在发展的道路上获得胜利的时候，我们都是非常兴奋，非常高兴的。因为我们认为你们在建设社会主义中所获得的胜利和成功就是我们的胜利和成功。
    波兰是一个不大的国家，人口很少，只有两千八百万人。如果没有社会主义大家庭的话，波兰作为一个国家单独地存在，是不能保卫自己的独立、不能进行社会主义建设的。
    也正因为此，我们努力加强和苏联及各人民民主国家的友谊和团结。
    也正因为此，中国人民对我们来说，是感到十分亲切的；中国共产党对我们来说，也是很亲切的。
    我们从波兰来到了这里，就是为了表达波兰人民对中国人民的伟大友谊；就是为了表达波兰人民对于中国的社会主义建设和保卫世界和平的斗争，表示团结之意。
    尊敬的教师们！青年们！祝你们在工作中，在学习中一切都好！一切都顺利！
    亲爱的青年朋友们！正如同波兰青年是波兰的未来一样，你们是人民中国的未来。今天，中国已是一个自由的国家，一个伟大的国家，这是由于几十年来中国的同志们、中国的老一代为争取祖国解放而斗争的斗士们，为中国创造出了解放的道路；中国的党也由于取得各种经验而壮大起来的结果。
    但是，十年、十五年、二十年以后，人民中国将会怎样？那就要看你们，看你们新的工程师、技师和新的知识分子的工作如何。
    我向你们青年们——人民中国的未来致敬！祝你们在学习中获得最好的成果！希望你们能很好地完成社会主义国家的青年们所应该完成的任务！
    中国青年万岁！
    中波友谊万岁！
    人民中国万岁！
    社会主义国家的团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
