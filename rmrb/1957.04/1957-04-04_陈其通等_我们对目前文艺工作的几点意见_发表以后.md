On January 7th, the People's Daily published an article by Chen Qitong, Chen Yading, Ma Hanbing, and Lu Le, titled "Some Opinions on Current Literary and Art Work." This article has evoked different reactions in literary and art circles and among readers. On January 17th, the Qingdao Daily published "Opinions on 'Some Opinions on Current Literary and Art Work'" by Hao Shi and Sun Mengfei. On February 19th, the Tianjin Daily published a report on "Tianjin Writers' Symposium on the Current Situation of Literature and Art." The February issue of the Shenyang literary monthly "Virgin Land" published a report on "Symposium on 'Some Opinions on Current Literary and Art Work'." On February 17th, the Liaoning Daily published an article by Yu Tie titled "Alarm Bell" (subtitle: Reading Chen Qitong, Ma Hanbing et al.'s "Some Opinions on Current Literary and Art Work"). On February 24th, the Jilin Daily published a report on "Provincial and Municipal Literary and Art Workers' Symposium on the Current Situation of Literary and Art Work," along with an article by Xu Xing titled "We Must Adhere to the Direction of Literature and Art Serving Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers," and an article by Han Jiang titled "My Different Views." On February 28th, the Dalian Daily reprinted Chen Qitong et al.'s article, with an editor's note: "This article raises several fundamental issues in implementing the Party Central Committee's 'Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend' policy on the literary and artistic front, which has attracted widespread attention in literary and art circles and related fields. In our province, the Literary and Education Department of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a symposium of literary and art editors that discussed this article. The participants unanimously agreed that this article is very important and timely, and that the opinions expressed in the article are correct (Liaoning Daily, February 21st)." The March issue of "Virgin Land" published "Our Views" by Liu Ruoyang and Kuang Shaokang. On March 7th, the Jilin Daily published "Let More New Flowers Bloom" by Nanyang, Muyi, and Huai Ren. In January and February, the People's Daily received more than twenty related letters and manuscripts. On March 1st, it published Chen Liao's "Opinions on the 'Opinions' of Comrade Chen Qitong et al." From these articles, reports, submissions, and letters, it can be seen that there are significant differences in opinion regarding the issues raised by Chen Qitong et al. (Unless otherwise stated, the quotations below are from readers' submissions and letters.)

	Regarding the overall evaluation and views on this article: Hao Shi and Sun Mengfei believe that under the rain and dew of the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy, the flowers in the literary and art garden are indeed thriving, which is the main and basic aspect, and it is only just beginning. At the same time, it cannot be denied that some weeds have also emerged. Weeds should be removed, but not at the expense of harming the flowers. Moreover, weeds are, after all, few, and one should not be so alarmed at the sight of them as to create endless worries, fearing "chaos in the world, and a confusion of right and wrong." At the symposium held by the Shenyang Writers Association, some people believed that the positive role of Chen Qitong et al.'s article was to remind everyone to prevent deviations, but most people felt that their article was relatively brief, with little argumentation and reasoning, and did not explain the issues clearly. At the same time, they also felt that there were many biased points in the article, and even some sectarian sentiments when it came to the relationship between socialist realism and writers. Liu Ruoyang and Kuang Shaokang, however, felt that they could not detect any sectarian sentiments, and only felt that the opinions were pertinent. It is inappropriate to think that Comrade Chen Qitong et al.'s article contains sectarian sentiments. Yu Tie believed that this was an alarm bell-like article that expressed a clear Party spirit. The several issues raised in the article, especially the spirit of safeguarding the proletarian Party spirit principle, should arouse our attention and deep thought. Xu Xing believed that Chen Qitong et al.'s actions in defending socialist thought and socialist realist thought in literature and art in response to the current chaotic situation in literary and art work cannot be said to be "too radical," "sectarian," or "contrary to the spirit of 'Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend'," but should be said to be necessary, timely, and correct.

	Li Qingqun of the Chinese Writers Association's Literary Workshop believed that the authors of this article had good intentions and were trying to support the Party's literary and artistic policy; however, the actual content clashed with the Party's "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy, and was also inconsistent with the actual situation. The introduction of the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" literary policy has brought unlimited vitality to the literary and artistic circles. Many old writers who had put down their pens for many years have picked them up again, some excellent plays that had almost been forgotten have begun to be staged again, and some issues that could only be discussed with one's wife in the past can now be discussed on the table. Of course, it cannot be denied that some unhealthy phenomena have also emerged in this prosperous scene, but this is completely in line with the law and not worth making a fuss about. The main problem in the current literary and art circles is still that there is not enough 'letting go' and not enough 'contending'. Many people are still not bold enough, and are still watching and hesitating. Chen Qitong et al.'s article, on the contrary, exaggerates the unhealthy phenomena, only sees the trees and not the forest, and therefore issues a sad tone, and then loudly calls for "suppressing the position and carrying out struggle." This low tone is not harmonious with the grand chorus of the current literary and art circles. Although the author's intention is good, the effect is to pour a bucket of cold water on the literary and art circles. Peng Yuanli of Hubei People's Publishing House believes that from their assessment of the current literary and art circles, they are doubtful of the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy, and are completely opposed to it in their thinking. Their assessment of the literary and art undertaking over the past year is full of pessimism and disappointment. They say that they do this "out of a sense of responsibility to the socialist literary undertaking." It seems that after our Party put forward this policy, it has abandoned leadership and responsibility for the socialist literary and art undertaking, which is very strange. Wei Qilin, Zeng Junru, Yang Zhanpeng and other nine people from the Chinese Department of Wuhan University said in their contributions that their evaluation of the achievements of literary and artistic creation in 1956 is different from that of Comrade Chen Qitong et al., and even the opposite. They believe that the assessment of Comrade Chen Qitong et al. is inconsistent with the facts. They only saw one side of the problem, and that is not an important side. Wei Qilin et al. said that they deeply feel that in the past year, our literary and artistic creation, whether it is novels, dramas, poetry, movies, features, essays, etc., has made many achievements and shown a vigorous vitality and a thriving scene, which is the result of implementing "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend."

	Regarding the direction of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers and the creative method of socialist realism: Hao Shi and Sun Mengfei believe that Comrade Chen Qitong et al. can certainly say that the creative method of socialist realism "is the only correct one for us," but it is not necessary to emphasize first that they are "Party literary and art workers." Because Party literary and art workers are not without the right to create using other methods, and non-Party writers can also regard socialist realism as the best creative method. To think that socialist realism is only uniquely correct for Party literary and art workers, and "not necessarily correct for everyone," and to use the distinction between Party and non-Party members as the standard for choosing or rejecting the creative method of socialist realism, is not appropriate enough. At present, there seem to be different understandings of socialist realism. In the spirit that the more truth is debated, the clearer it becomes, different opinions should be allowed to be expressed, without rushing to label them as "skepticism," "abolitionism," or even "petty-bourgeois art thought." This will not produce positive results for "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend." Some people even think that revolutionary romanticism, which is developing independently, is better than the creative method of socialist realism. According to the February 24th report in the Jilin Daily, some people said that we should not talk about any 'isms'; as long as readers and audiences welcome it, it should be affirmed as a good work. Han Jiang believes that there are people who do not advocate the creative method of socialist realism, but only agree with realism or replace it with "realism of the socialist era," but they are definitely a minority, or even isolated individuals. It has absolutely not reached the point where "fewer and fewer people advocate it," as Chen Qitong et al. said. In implementing the literary and artistic direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, there was a debate last year when discussing the question of "Why are there so few good domestic films?" From the debate, it can also be seen that the vast majority of people insist on this direction, and only a few people have a relatively vague understanding, and it has not reached the point where fewer and fewer people advocate it.

	Li Hengde of the Shenyang Jianxin Factory believes that the creative method of socialist realism is now, and will continue to be in the future, the most correct creative path that should be followed. However, we cannot assume that its definition and explanation are already complete and flawless. We must explore it more deeply to make it richer and more complete. If we hold such a spirit and purpose, it should be welcomed, and we must not confuse it with abolitionists and skeptics. It would not be appropriate to regard it all as a product of petty-bourgeois thought. Yu Yuanfu of Hubei People's Publishing House said in his contribution: The impression this article gives me is that the concept of socialist realism is not open to discussion. If anyone expresses different views on this concept, they will be called "skeptics" and "abolitionists" who are "products of petty-bourgeois art thought." In the past and at present, in our literary and art ranks, there are very many supporters of the creative method of socialist realism, and they consciously create in accordance with the method of socialist realism, and maintain, consolidate, and expand its influence. There are Party writers and non-Party writers here, and everyone consciously unites and cooperates under the banner of socialist realism. Is defending socialist realism only the business of Party writers? Is socialist realism the same as the Party Constitution? My view is that the ranks of socialist realism are incredibly strong today, and will continue to expand their ranks in the future. Party writers and non-Party writers consciously unite under this banner. The proposition of separating Party and non-Party writers is not only tactless, but also inconsistent with objective reality. I believe that everyone has the right to express their opinions, but we must prevent sectarian sentiments, and even more so, we should not act like "veterans" to stop others from expressing their opinions. It is best to analyze specific issues more, and do not replace genuine academic exploration with "summaries." Fu Zhenggu of New Observer believes that these discussions are contrary to the Party's spirit of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," revealing a kind of sectarian sentiment that hinders the unity of the literary and art circles, and is also harmful to creation. In the past, there was not only dogmatism in the issue of socialist realism, but it was also quite serious. Theoretical dogmatism will inevitably lead creation to the path of formulaization and conceptualization. There are many reasons for the emergence of formulaization and conceptualization, and it cannot all be attributed to this aspect, let alone cancel the new literary and artistic direction of socialist realism. Despite this, people still have the right to question and express opinions on the dogmatism, simplification, and vulgarization in the understanding and interpretation of socialist realism. This will not shake or abolish socialist realism; on the contrary, it will better protect it. Besides, socialist realism is not a dead concept. With the development of the times and creation, it itself needs to be constantly developed. Precisely in this area, we have not done too much, but have only just begun to fight against theoretical dogmatism. Since socialist realism "is not the only one" and "not necessarily correct for everyone," then why is it "uniquely correct" for Party literary and art workers? Can't a Party writer adopt other creative methods? If a Party writer questions certain parts of socialist realist theory, is that petty-bourgeois literary and artistic thought or a lack of Party spirit? The problem also lies in the fact that it seems that only Party literary and art workers can adhere to and promote socialist realism, and can "suppress the position and carry out struggle," and that it is only uniquely correct for Party writers. This draws an opposing line between Party and non-Party members, placing Party literary and art workers above non-Party members, seeing them as higher, and also greatly reducing the scope of socialist realism's influence. Li Qingqun believes that regarding the issue of creative methods, Comrade Lu Dingyi's report has already stated very clearly: The creative method of socialist realism is the best, but it is not the only one. If we attempt to emphasize the creative method of socialist realism as the only one by changing the subject, it is equivalent to excluding other creative methods, which is equivalent to canceling competition, and in essence, denying the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy. If we allow the existence of various creative schools, it is inevitable that some people will doubt socialist realism, and this doubt should be allowed. If we think that socialist realism is the best creative method, then we should not be afraid of doubt. "True gold fears no fire." Only with doubt can there be contention, and only in contention can we learn from each other's strengths and make the most correct one shine. Any attempt to simply label ideological differences with "skepticism" or "abolitionism," or to label them as "products of petty-bourgeois art thought," is an attempt to block other people's mouths and prevent them from speaking. Wei Qilin et al. believe that there are indeed people writing articles to express doubts and explore the creative method of socialist realism. Let's set aside whether this doubt is justified or not, but as a way to implement the "Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy, this phenomenon is normal and necessary. Why can't we express doubts and explore the creative method of socialist realism? Comrade Chen Qitong et al. lack sufficient theoretical basis on this issue, and in practice, they reveal an administrative sectarian tendency and sentiment that we are currently focusing on opposing and overcoming. Now, among those who promote and adhere to socialist realism, there are Party writers and non-Party writers. Those who doubt it and make new explorations of it are also the same. The vast majority of them are sincere and want to find a solution to the problem. This is a very natural and good phenomenon. At present, we have not yet, and cannot quickly, obtain satisfactory solutions to many problems in socialist realism and aesthetics. Therefore, what we urgently need now is learning, exploration, and practice!

	Regarding the issues of formulaization and conceptualization: Hao Shi and Sun Mengfei believe that some comrades suggest that the subject matter should be broader, which does not violate the Party's policy, and does not violate the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. The ideological transformation of intellectuals and the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, from a general perspective, also serve workers, peasants, and soldiers, and can also be written about. In this case, there is no need to rush to propose the derogatory term "theory of broad subject matter" and oppose it to the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. In fact, it is difficult to imagine a "theory of broad subject matter" that is "broad" enough to exclude workers, peasants, and soldiers from the subject matter of writing. If that is the case, it is not a "theory of broad subject matter," but a "theory of narrow subject matter." Writers who are familiar with workers, peasants, and soldiers can still use workers, peasants, and soldiers as their subject matter, and should better express workers, peasants, and soldiers. What's wrong with some writers who are not familiar with workers, peasants, and soldiers, especially old writers, starting to pick up their pens to write about the characters and lives they are familiar with? The fact that there are still few works about workers, peasants, and soldiers does not mean that there are already too many works about other aspects, so many that they "usurp the position of the host." "Usurping the position of the host" is certainly not allowed, but if we issue an eviction order before the guests have even arrived, the guests will only look on and leave. At the symposium of the Shenyang Writers Association, many comrades believed that the "theory of broad subject matter" and the literary and artistic direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers are not contradictory or opposed. In fact, no one is wavering or ambiguous about the literary and artistic direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. The direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers does not exclude the breadth of subject matter, and the subject matter cannot be broad enough to serve workers, peasants, and soldiers well. At present, the subject matter of our literary and artistic works is not very broad, but still very narrow. At the same time, we cannot think that not directly writing about workers, peasants, and soldiers does not mean serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and cannot produce good works. It is also wrong to oppose writing about "household matters" and "love between children" to political struggle. At present, our actual situation has not been that the dramatic changes of struggle have been covered up because of writing about "household matters" and "love between children." According to a report in the Tianjin Daily on February 19, some writers believe that "Write about whatever is in life, regardless of its meaning." Some people even said, "Hu Feng's 'Life is everywhere' doesn't seem wrong now." According to a report in the Jilin Daily on February 24, some people believed that the policy of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, which was determined by Chairman Mao in his speech at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, was put forward in the specific environment at that time, and that today's society has changed. We are now all socialist people living socialist lives, and it is not necessary to emphasize writing about workers, peasants, and soldiers. Write about whatever you are familiar with, and do not have to consciously experience the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers that you are not familiar with. Today, writing college student love songs and sofas and pianos can all be said to be serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. At that time, some people criticized the saying "Write about whatever you are familiar with," believing that if this is the case, writers will not actively devote themselves to the heat of the struggle, and our literary creation will become "writing about oneself," so who will write about workers, peasants, and soldiers? In Xu Xing's article, he put forward a more detailed objection to this statement, believing that today, workers, peasants, and soldiers are the basic forces for building and defending our socialism. If we do not focus on expressing them, how can we reflect the face and voice of this era and society? "Our current literary creation not only excessively reflects the life of the petty bourgeoisie, but also is full of petty-bourgeois ideological sentiments. As for writing about landlords and capitalists, those dregs of our society and the classes being transformed, even if we can put them to ink in order to reflect the life of our era, how can they be compared with writing about workers, peasants, and soldiers?" "You can write about whatever life you are familiar with" seems to make some sense on the surface, but it is actually wrong: first, it confuses general everyday life experiences with life as a source of creation, and makes a vulgar understanding of life as a source of creation, because not any everyday life that you are familiar with can become a source of creation. Second, since "you can write about whatever life you are familiar with," then everyone can only write about the things around them, without the need to go deep into the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers, without the need to throw themselves into the heat of the mass struggle, and without the need to transform and improve themselves in the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and in the real struggle. In short, these arguments are completely consistent with some bad signs and unhealthy situations that have appeared in creation at present, and the latter is precisely a reflection of the former. These views, whether conscious or unconscious, and no matter how circuitous and obscure they are, are in fact and in practical effect opposed to the policy of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and are intended to abolish or deny the policy of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers.

	Regarding the issue of sorting out the legacy: According to a report in the Jilin Daily on February 24, many comrades in the drama troupes believe that the issues raised by Chen Qitong and the other three comrades are in line with the actual situation. For example, the Ping opera, which can express real life, rarely reflects real life anymore. Some Ping opera troupes have not performed a single play with a realistic theme in the past year, although this troupe made its fortune by performing plays with realistic themes in the past. The selection of drama plays is also often based on box office revenue and audience tastes, scrambling to stage excellent plays since the May Fourth Movement. Some directors and actors even refuse to accept staging plays with realistic themes. The leaders of the troupes are also content to cater to the tastes of the audience in the city, unwilling to go to factories for touring performances, and unwilling to stage small plays reflecting real life. Under the pretext of "not selling tickets" and "not being popular," there are fewer and fewer new flowers in the plays performed by the troupes. A certain unit did not have a single play reflecting real life in its 1957-1958 play plan. Chen Qitong et al.'s article attracted their attention, and they are prepared to change this situation. The article "Let More New Flowers Bloom" by Nanyang, Muyi, and Huai Ren in the Jilin Daily on March 7 specifically discussed this issue, believing that in the recent period, the number of plays staged by various troupes that reflect real life is too small, at least smaller than in the previous period. In addition to other objective reasons, some are due to the ideological problems of the troupes in selecting plays to stage and the subjectivity and one-sidedness in their understanding of certain policies. In addition, some incorrect signs have also appeared in the artistic thinking of some opera actors. Some people have taken this opportunity to deny all the achievements of opera reform in recent years, thinking that they are all wrong, and even the work of clarifying unhealthy and ugly images on the stage in the past has been described as "rules and regulations." Therefore, they feel that the position of staging plays should also be suppressed to allow more new flowers to bloom.

	According to a report in the Tianjin Daily, some drama troupes now determine the plays to stage solely based on the level of "box office revenue," pursuing entertainment, regardless of ancient or modern, Chinese or foreign, or whether the performance is realistic or not, as long as it makes money, and do not actively stage plays reflecting modern life and improve the quality of the performance. Many opera troupes only pay attention to digging up old plays and dusting off old jokes, bringing many toxic things to the stage without any changes, and rarely pay attention to sorting out, processing, and improving them. Or they only pay attention to sorting out old plays and neglect the creation of new plays. Some actors only care about pursuing performance techniques and neglect learning from life.

	The article "Opinions" by Hao Shi and Sun Mengfei in the Qingdao Daily said: Regarding the issue of "new flowers" and "old flowers," we advocate letting both bloom, and the old ones should also be "brought forth from the old." It is not a bad thing for some people to "dig up old plays" and sort out the "valuable legacy left by their ancestors." This work of sorting out our rich national heritage has only just begun compared to what needs to be done. As for sorting out roughly and "crowning oneself with one's own name to seek fame and fortune," that is another matter, which should also be opposed in the opening of "new flowers," and cannot be generalized because of this.

	Liang Zhiyi of the Liaoning Provincial Cultural Bureau's Opera Playwriting Office said on this issue: What makes us particularly feel is their discrimination against opera workers. We know something of the bitterness in this, and we are unwilling to remain silent, so we would like to say a few words about the third point of Comrade Chen Qitong et al.'s feelings. We are people who "are keen on digging up old plays," but we are definitely not people who "are keen on taking shortcuts." There are people who "slightly sort out the legacy left by their ancestors and crown themselves with their own names to seek fame and profit," as Comrade Chen Qitong et al. said, but they are indeed a minority. However, we must not draw the conclusion from this that all who sort out traditional plays are "taking shortcuts." Comrade Chen Qitong et al. probably do not fully understand the actual situation of opera workers, and stubbornly treat the backward phenomena and work shortcomings of a few people as the whole picture. At present, our opera work is in a historical condition of "inheriting the past and opening up the future." Opera workers must both create new culture and sort out the legacy, and inheriting tradition is part of creating new culture. This work must be done, and it must be done with a cautious and serious attitude and meticulous care. Since this is the case, "taking shortcuts" is not allowed, and painstaking effort must be paid. And sorting it out well—whether it is a major overhaul or "dotting the dragon's eyes"—is a kind of creation. To be more specific: The opera legacy since the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties and the traditional plays of various genres are a valuable legacy left by our ancestors, but they contain a lot of essence, dross, mixed together. Sorting it out can dust off the dust and release its brilliance; not sorting it out has a negative effect. The fact that our country's opera art has won honors on the international stage in recent years is also because it has undergone a correct process of "bringing forth the new from the old." Obviously, it cannot be achieved by "taking shortcuts." We are inheritors of the legacy, and also promoters and creators. Promoting and creating is not an easy task. Doesn't it take painstaking hard work to sort out a good play? And this labor now seems not to be recognized by people, making us deeply feel that we are in an unequal position with new literary and art workers. Comrade Chen Qitong et al.'s view is one of this kind. Usually, what we come into contact with is often treated with this attitude. For example, someone (all of whom are new literary and art workers) asks us, "What work are you doing now?" If we answer "Sorting out opera scripts," they will first sneer and then advise you to change careers: "That line is not good, what prospects are there!" In fact, it really does not look like there are prospects: After writing the script, publishing agencies are unwilling to publish it, and if it is reluctantly published, it is also regarded as the lowest grade. Not to mention author representative meetings, there is even less status there. It seems that those who are engaged in opera are all "declining literati" who are forced to do this line because of a lack of avenues. There are social and historical reasons for this. Therefore, we feel that Comrade Chen Qitong et al.'s views are representative, and the reason lies here. And it must also be pointed out that those who hold this view not only despise opera workers, but also despise the national tradition they are facing. I am afraid that few people who say such things do not have prejudices or doubts about the national tradition.

	There are shortcomings in our work. But if we arbitrarily treat shortcomings as mistakes in direction and policy to criticize, it is inevitable to make people feel "subjective." We feel that Comrade Chen Qitong et al. distinguish between old flowers and new flowers as the primary and secondary, looking at them in opposition, which does not meet the requirements of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom," because if there is a designated primary one, it is difficult to have "simultaneous" blooming. Who is good and who is bad is not something that can be passed by who stipulates which one is the primary one. We must let everyone compete freely. New flowers are certainly good, but old flowers cannot be excluded because of this, and after old flowers are given new life, we cannot help but regard them as a new kind of flower, only that they are rooted in the tradition. The richness of people's spiritual life is multifaceted, and it is also beneficial to socialism indirectly. The correct combination of the two, competing for beauty and splendor, can be colorful and fragrant. Emphasizing either side is inevitably one-sided.

专栏：

    陈其通等“我们对目前文艺工作的几点意见”发表以后
    1月7日人民日报发表了陈其通、陈亚丁、马寒冰、鲁勒的文章“我们对目前文艺工作的几点意见”。这篇文章，在文艺界和读者中引起了不同的反映。1月17日青岛日报发表了郝石、孙孟非的“对‘我们对目前文艺工作的几点意见’的意见”。2月19日天津日报发表了“天津作家座谈当前文艺情况”的报道。二月号沈阳“处女地”文学月刊发表了“关于‘我们对目前文艺工作的几点意见’的座谈”的报道。2月17日辽宁日报发表了于铁的文章“警钟”（副题：读陈其通马寒冰等“我们对目前文艺工作的几点意见”）。2月24日吉林日报发表了“省市文艺工作者座谈当前文艺工作情况的”报道，同时发表了许行的文章“必须坚持文艺为工农兵服务的方针”，以及寒江的文章“我的不同看法”。2月28日旅大日报转载了陈其通等的文章，编辑部并加了按语：“这篇文章提出了当前在文学艺术战线上贯彻党中央提出的‘百花齐放，百家争鸣’方针中几个原则性的问题，引起了文艺界及有关方面的广泛注意。在我省，日前中共辽宁省委文教部召开的文艺编辑座谈会曾经讨论了这篇文章。与会者一致认为这篇文章是很重要的，也是及时的，文章中提出的几点意见，都是正确的（2月21日辽宁日报报道）”。三月号“处女地”发表了刘若阳、匡少康的“我们的看法”。3月7日吉林日报发表了南阳、穆宜、怀仁的文章“让更多的新花开放起来”。在1月和2月中，人民日报共收到有关的信、稿二十余件，3月1日发表了陈辽的“对陈其通等同志的‘意见’的意见”。从这些文章、报道、来稿、来信中，可以看出，对陈其通等所提出的问题，在看法上有很大的纷歧（下面引文的出处除注明为报刊者外，都引自读者的来稿来信。）。
    关于对这篇文章的总的估价和看法　郝石、孙孟非认为在“百花齐放，百家争鸣”这一方针的雨露的润泽下，文艺园地的花朵确实已在欣欣向荣，这是主要的、基本的方面，而且还仅仅是一个开始。但同时，不可否认，有些莠草也破土而出。莠草应当拔除，但不能因此而使花朵受到损伤。而且，莠草毕竟是少的，不能一见就花了眼，从而产生了无穷的忧虑，担心“天下大乱，邪正不分”。在沈阳作家协会举行的座谈会上，有人认为陈其通等的文章的积极作用在于可以提醒大家防止偏差，但大多数人认为他们的文章比较简短，论证和说理的东西少，没有把问题谈清楚，同时，也感到文章中有许多偏激的地方，甚至在触及到社会主义现实主义与作家的关系上，有些宗派主义的情绪。刘若阳、匡少康则认为，感觉不出有什么宗派主义情绪，而只觉得所提意见是中肯的。认为陈其通等同志的文章有宗派主义情绪是不妥当的。于铁认为这是一篇表现了鲜明党性的警钟般的文章。文中所提出来的几个问题，特别是保卫无产阶级党性原则的那种精神，是应该引起我们的注意和深思的。许行认为陈其通等同志针对当前文艺工作中的混乱情况，起来捍卫社会主义思想、捍卫文艺上社会主义现实主义思想，就不能说是“过于偏激”、“有宗派主义情绪”、“有违‘百花齐放，百家争鸣’的精神”，而应该说是必要的、适时的，同时也是正确的。
    中国作家协会文学讲习所李青群认为这篇文章的作者的用意是好的，是在极力拥护党的文艺方针；但实际内容和党所提出的“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的文艺方针是抵触的，而且也是不符合实际情况的。“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的文艺方针的提出，给文艺界带来了无限生机，许多搁笔多年的老作家又拿起笔来，一些几乎被人忘记了的优秀剧目又开始上演，一些过去只能和老婆谈谈的问题，也敢拿出来在桌面上谈了。当然，不能否认，在这一片繁荣景象当中，也出现了一些不健康的现象，但这是完全合乎规律的，不值得大惊小怪。当前文艺界主要问题仍在于放的不多，鸣的不够。许多人还不够大胆，还在观望和犹豫。而陈其通等的文章恰恰相反，把不健康的现象夸大了，只见树木不见森林，因而发出悲哀的调子，进而大声疾呼要“压住阵脚进行斗争”。这种低沉的调子是与当前文艺界的大合唱不和谐的。尽管作者用意是好的，但效果却是向文艺界泼了一瓢冷水。湖北人民出版社彭元礼认为从他们对目前文学艺术界的估计看来，对“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针是怀疑的，思想上是完全抵触的。他们对一年来的文学艺术事业的估价充满了悲观失望的气氛。他们说他们这样作是“出自对社会主义文学事业的责任感”。好像我们党提出了这一方针以后，对社会主义的文学艺术事业已经放弃了领导，放弃了责任，这是非常令人奇怪的。武汉大学中文系韦其麟、曾君儒、杨展鹏等九人来稿中说，他们对于1956年文艺创作的成绩的估价同陈其通等同志不同，甚至是恰好相反。他们认为陈其通等同志的估计是不符事实的。他们只看到了问题的一面，而且是不重要的一面。韦其麟等说，他们深切地感到，在去年一年中，我们的文学艺术创作，无论是小说、戏剧、诗歌、电影、特写、杂文等等，都取得了不少成绩，呈现出一种蓬勃的生机和欣欣向荣的景象，这正是执行“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的结果。
    关于文艺为工农兵服务的方向和社会主义现实主义创作方法问题
  郝石、孙孟非认为陈其通等同志尽可以说社会主义现实主义的创作方法“对我们却是唯一正确的”，但不必一定要首先强调自己“作为一个党的文艺工作者”。因为，党的文艺工作者并非没有权利用其他的方法来创作，而非党作家也可以把社会主义现实主义当作最好的创作方法。认为社会主义现实主义只对于党的文艺工作者是唯一正确的，而“不一定对一切人都是正确的”，这种以党与非党来作为社会主义现实主义创作方法取舍标准的说法，是不够妥当的。目前对社会主义现实主义似乎还存在着不同的理解，本着真理愈辩愈明的精神，应当允许各种不同的意见发表出来，而不必忙于扣上“怀疑论”、“取消论”以至“小资产阶级艺术思想”的帽子，这对于“百花齐放，百家争鸣”是不会产生积极效果的。也有的人认为正在独立发展的革命浪漫主义，就比社会主义现实主义的创作方法要好。另据吉林日报2月24日报道中说，有的人说还是不要谈什么主义，只要读者、观众欢迎，就该肯定它是好作品。寒江认为不提倡社会主义现实主义的创作方法，而只赞成现实主义或者以“社会主义时代的现实主义”代替它的人是有的，但究竟是少数的，甚至是个别的。它绝对没有达到陈其通等同志所说的“越来越很少有人提倡了”的地步。在贯彻为工农兵服务的文艺方向方面，去年在讨论“为什么好的国产影片少？”这个问题时，有过争论，从争论中也可以看出坚持这个方向的人占绝大多数，只有少数人认识上还比较模糊，也并没有达到提倡的人越来越少的地步。
    沈阳建新工厂李亨得认为社会主义现实主义的创作方法，它现在是将来也仍然是最正确而且应该遵循的创作道路。但我们不能以为它的定义和解释，已经是完满无缺的了，我们还必须更深入地去探讨，使它更加丰富和完善。假若是抱着这样的精神和目的，那是应该欢迎的，决不能同取消论怀疑论者混同起来。如果一律看作是小资产阶级思想的产物，那就不是恰当的了。湖北人民出版社俞元辅来稿中说：这篇文章给我的印象是：对于社会主义现实主义这一概念是不容讨论的。如果任何人对这一概念提出不同的看法，都会被称为“小资产阶级艺术思想的产物”的“怀疑论者”和“取消论者”。过去和目前在我们的文艺队伍中，对社会主义现实主义的创作方法，有非常众多的拥护者，而且自觉地按照社会主义现实主义的方法进行创作，并维护、巩固和扩大它的影响。这里有党员作家和非党作家，大家在社会主义现实主义的旗帜下自觉的团结，互相合作。保卫社会主义现实主义是否仅仅是党员作家的事？社会主义现实主义是否等同于党章？我的看法是，社会主义现实主义的队伍今天无比强大，今后还会不断扩大自己的队伍，党员作家和非党作家自觉地团结在这个旗帜下。将党和非党的作家分开的提法不仅是不策略的，更是不符合客观实际的。我认为每一个人都有发表自己意见的权利，但是要防止宗派主义情绪，更不要以“元老”自居制止别人发表意见。最好是对具体问题多多分析，不要以“总结”的方式来代替真正的学术性的探讨。新观察傅正谷来稿中认为这些议论是有违于党的“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的政策精神，流露出一种有碍于文艺界的团结的宗派主义情绪，对创作也是有害的。过去在社会主义现实主义问题上不但有教条主义，而且还相当严重。理论上的教条主义是必然会把创作引导到公式化概念化的道路上去的。产生公式化概念化的原因是多方面的，不能把它都归到这方面去，更不能取消社会主义现实主义这个新的文艺方向。尽管如此，人们仍有权对在关于社会主义现实主义的理解和解释上的教条主义、简单化庸俗化的倾向提出质疑和意见，这样作不但不会动摇或取消了社会主义现实主义，相反的是更好的保卫了它，何况社会主义现实主义并不是一个死的概念，随着时代和创作的发展，它本身也是需要不断发展的。恰恰在这方面，我们不是作的多了，而是刚刚开始向理论上的教条主义作斗争。社会主义现实主义“既然不是唯一的”，也“不一定对一切人都是正确的”，那末，为什么对于党的文艺工作者又是“唯一正确的”呢？是不是一个党员作家就不能采取其他的创作方法了呢？如果一个党员作家对社会主义现实主义理论的某些部分提出质疑，是否就是小资产阶级的文艺思想或党性不强呢？问题还在于，仿佛社会主义现实主义只有党的文艺工作者才能坚持和宣传，才能“压住阵脚进行斗争”，而且只有对于党员作家才是唯一正确的，这就在党与非党之间划了一条对立的界限，把党的文艺工作者放在非党之上，看得比他们要高些，同时也是大大缩小了社会主义现实主义影响的范围。李青群认为关于创作方法问题，陆定一同志的报告已经谈的非常明确：社会主义现实主义创作方法是最好的，但不是唯一的。如果企图用偷天换日的办法，仍然把社会主义现实主义创作方法强调成唯一的，就等于排斥了其他的创作方法，就等于取消了竞赛，实质上就是否认了“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针。如果允许各种创作流派的存在，也就势必难免有人对社会主义现实主义产生怀疑，这种怀疑应该是允许的。如果认为社会主义现实主义是最好的创作方法，那就不应该害怕怀疑，“真金不怕火炼”，有了怀疑才能有争鸣，在争鸣中才能取长补短，才能使最正确的放出光辉。任何把思想上的纷歧，简单地加上“怀疑论”“取消论”的标签，扣上“小资产阶级艺术思想的产物”的帽子，都是想硬堵住别人的嘴不让别人说话的办法。韦其麟等认为对于社会主义现实主义的创作方法，确实是有人写文章对它表示怀疑和进行探讨。我们姑且不管这种怀疑是否有理由，但作为贯彻“百家争鸣”的方针来说，这种现象是正常的，必要的。为什么不可以对社会主义现实主义的创作方法表示怀疑进行探讨呢？陈其通等同志在这一问题上在理论上缺乏充分的根据，而在实践上，却流露出一种我们目前正在着重反对和克服的行政性的宗派主义的倾向和情绪。现在，宣传和坚持社会主义现实主义的人中，党员作家有之，非党作家亦有之。怀疑它、对它有新的探索的，同样也是如此。他们绝大多数都是真诚的，想求得问题的解决的，这是很自然的也是很好的现象。现在我们对社会主义现实主义以及美学上的许多问题，都还没有而且也不可能很快获得圆满解决，因此，我们目前迫切需要的是学习、探索、实践！
    关于公式化、概念化问题　郝石、孙孟非认为有些同志提出题材应该广泛些，并没有什么违背党的方针的地方，而且也并没有违背为工农兵服务的方向。知识分子的思想改造，对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，从总的方面来看，也是为工农兵服务，也都可以写。既然这样，就不必急于提出所谓“题材广泛论”的贬词，并把它和为工农兵服务的方向对立起来。事实上，很难想像会有那么一种“题材广泛论”，“广泛”到把工农兵摒拒到写作的题材之外。如果那样，就不是什么“题材广泛论”，而是“题材狭隘论”了。熟悉工农兵的作家仍旧可以以工农兵为题材，并且要更好地表现工农兵；而有些对工农兵不熟悉或者不够熟悉的作家，特别是老作家，也开始拿起笔来去写他们所熟悉的人物和生活，这又有什么不好呢？写工农兵的作品还少，并不就等于写其他方面的作品已经太多，多到“喧宾夺主”的地步了。“夺主”当然不行，但客人还没有来就下了逐客令，客人也就只有望望而去了。在沈阳作家协会座谈会上，许多同志都认为“题材广泛论”和为工农兵服务的文艺方向并不是矛盾的、对立的，实际上，现在并没有人对为工农兵服务的文艺方向动摇或模糊。为工农兵服务的方向并不排斥题材的广泛，题材不广泛就不能很好地为工农兵服务。目前我们文艺作品的题材并不是很广泛，而仍是很狭窄，同时，不能认为不直接写工人、农民和战士就不算是为工农兵服务，就不能产生好作品。把写“家务事”与“儿女情”同政治斗争对立起来也是不对的，目前我们的实际情况还没有因为写“家务事”与“儿女情”掩盖了天翻地复的斗争变革。据2月19日天津日报的报道，有的作家认为“生活中有什么就写什么，别管什么意义。”甚至有人讲：“胡风的‘到处有生活’现在看起来也并不错。”据2月24日吉林日报的报道，有人认为毛主席在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话中确定的文艺为工农兵服务的方针，是在当时的特定环境中提出来的，而今天的社会，有了变化。我们现在是社会主义的人，又都是社会主义的生活，可以不必强调写工农兵。熟悉什么写什么，不必有意识的去体验自己不熟悉的工农兵生活；在今天，写大学生情歌、写沙发钢琴，都可以说是为工农兵服务的。当时有人批评了“熟悉什么写什么”的说法，认为如果这样，作家都不积极投身于火热斗争中去，我们的文学创作将会变成“自写自”了，那么谁来写工农兵呢？在许行的文章里，对这种说法提出了比较详细的反对意见，认为在今天，工农兵乃是建设和保卫我们社会主义的基本力量，我们不去着重的表现他们，又怎能反映我们这时代的、社会的面貌和声音呢？“我们现在的文艺创作不仅过多的反映了小资产阶级的生活，而且作品里也充满了小资产阶级思想情调。至于写地主、资本家，那些我们这一社会的渣滓和正在被改造中的阶级，即使为了反映我们这一时代的生活，也可以把他们付诸笔墨，但又怎样能跟写工农兵来相提并论呢？”“熟悉什么生活就可以写什么”的这种说法，表面听来似乎有些道理，实际是错误的：第一、这是把一般平常生活经验阅历等，跟作为创作泉源的生活混淆起来了，把作为创作泉源的生活作了庸俗的理解，因为并不是任何日常所熟悉的生活都可以成为创作源泉的。第二、既然“熟悉什么生活就可以写什么”，那么大家就都可以只写自己身边的一些事物了，无需再深入到工农兵生活中去了，无需再投到火热的群众斗争中去了，同时也就无需要在工农兵群众中、在现实斗争中来改造和提高自己了。总之，这些论调，跟目前在创作上出现的某些不好的苗头、不够健康的情况是完全一致的，后者也正是前者的反映。这些观点不管其自觉的或不自觉的，也不管其讲的如何迂回和隐晦，其实质上、实际效果上都是跟文艺为工农兵服务方针相对立的，都是要取消或否认文艺为工农兵服务方针的。
    关于　整理　遗产的问题　据2月24日吉林日报的报道，许多剧团的同志都认为陈其通等四位同志提出的问题是符合实际情况的，比如能够表现现实生活的评剧，也很少反映现实生活了，有的评剧团去年一年就没有演出过一个现实题材的剧目，虽然这个剧团在过去还是靠演现实题材剧目而发家的。话剧剧目的选择，也多从上座率、观众趣味着眼，争排“五四”以来的优秀剧目，有的导演、演员竟然拒绝接受排演现实题材的剧目。剧团的领导也安于在城市投合观众趣味，不愿意去工厂巡回演出，不愿意排演反映现实生活的小戏。在“不卖钱”“不叫座”的借口下，剧团演出剧目中的新花越来越少了。某单位在规划1957—1958年剧目中没有一个反映现实生活的剧目。陈其通等同志的文章引起了他们的注意，他们准备改变这种情况。3月7日吉林日报南阳、穆宜、怀仁的文章“让更多的新花开放起来”，专门讨论了这个问题，认为近一个时期各剧团上演反映现实生活的剧目太少了，起码是比前一个时期少了一些。这除了其他方面的客观原因之外，也有些是属于剧团选择上演剧目的思想问题和对某些政策理解上的主观性、片面性所致。另外，有些戏曲演员的艺术思想也出现了不正确的苗头，有人趁此时机把几年来的戏曲改革成绩一概否定，认为都错了，就连过去澄清舞台上不健康的东西、丑恶的形象的工作，也说成是“清规戒律”。因此，觉得也应当压住上演剧目的阵脚，让更多的新花开放起来。
    据天津日报的报道，有些剧团现在单纯以“上座率”高低来确定剧目，追求趣味，不管古今中外，表演真实与否，只要赚钱就行，而不积极地演出反映现代生活的剧目与提高演出质量。许多戏曲剧团只注意了翻箱底、抖包袱，把许多有毒素的东西也原封不动的搬上舞台，而很少注意整理、加工、提高。或者只注意整理旧剧目，忽视对新剧本的创作。有些演员也只顾追求表演技术，而忽视了向生活学习。
    青岛日报郝石、孙孟非的文章说：关于“新花”和“旧花”的问题，我们主张让两者都开放，而且旧的也要“推陈出新”。有些人“翻老箱底”，整理“老祖宗留下的宝贵遗产”，这也并不是坏事情。这种整理我们丰富的民族遗产的工作已经做到的比起要做的来还只能说是一个开端。至于整理得粗糙和“冠上自己的名字去图名利”，那是另外一回事，在开放“新花”当中也要反对，不能因此而以偏概全。
    辽宁省文化局戏曲编剧室梁志翼对这一问题说：特别使我们感到他们对戏曲工作者的歧视。我们颇知道些此中甘苦，又不愿沉默，所以想单就陈其通等同志感想的第三点说几句。我们是“热衷于翻老箱底”的人，但可绝不是“热衷于走捷径”的人。陈其通等同志所说的：“把老祖宗留下的遗产稍加整理就冠上自己名字去图名求利”的人，是有的，但也确是少数。然而，绝不能据此得出结论：凡整理传统剧目，都是“走捷径”。陈其通等同志恐怕还不大十分了解戏曲工作者的实际情况，硬把少数人的落后现象和工作缺点说成是全貌。目前，我们的戏曲工作处于“继往开来”的历史条件下，戏曲工作者既要创造新文化，又要整理遗产，而继承传统，正是新文化创造的一部分。这工作，非做不可，而且必须以慎重的严肃的态度，细致地去做。既如此，就不许“走捷径”，就要付出心血。而整理得好的——不论是大拆大卸、还是“画龙点睛”，都是一种创造。再具体些说：元、明、清以来的戏曲遗产和各剧种的传统剧目，虽是老祖宗留下的宝贵遗产，但其中却有不少是精华、糟粕，杂揉并存。整了，可拂去灰尘放出光采；不整，有消极作用。我国戏曲艺术近年来能在国际舞台上获得荣誉，也在于它是经过正确的“推陈出新”的过程，显然，不是“走捷径”可以达到的。我们对遗产，是继承者，也是发扬与创造者。发扬与创造并非轻易之举。整出一个好戏，何尝不需经过辛勤刻苦的劳动？而这劳动，现在仿佛是不被人们所承认，使我们深有与新文艺工作者处于不平等地位之感。陈其通等同志的观点，即此一种。平时我们所接触到的，也往往以这种态度来对待。比如有人（都是新文艺工作者）问我们：“现在做什么工作？”若答“整戏曲剧本”；他们就先冷笑，而后劝你改行：“干那一行不好，有什么出息！”事实上果然是不像有出息的样子：写出了本子，出版机关不愿出，勉强出版了也是目为下下之品。更不必提什么作者代表会之类，那更是没有名分。仿佛，搞戏曲的都是“没落文人”，迫于出路，才干这一行似的。这是有社会与历史的原因的。所以我们觉得陈其通等同志的观点，是有代表性的，原因也就在这里。而且也必须指出，持这种观点的人，不单是轻视了戏曲工作者，而是轻视了面对着的民族传统。恐怕说这样话的人，很少不是对民族传统抱着成见或怀疑的。
    在我们工作上是有缺点的。但如武断地把缺点当成方向、方针的错误去非难，就难免使人有“主观主义”之感。我们感到陈其通等同志把老花、新花区别为主次之分，对立起来看，是不符合“百花齐放”要求的，因为要有命定为主的，就难以有“齐”放。谁好、谁坏，不是谁规定哪个为主就可以通过的，要让大家自由竞赛。新花固好，老花也不能因而受到排斥，而且老花被赋予新的生命之后就不能不把它看成是一种新的花朵，只不过它们是生根在传统的基础上。人们精神生活的丰富，是多方面的，间接对人们有益也对社会主义有利。两者正确结合，争奇斗艳，才能万紫千红，满苑芬芳。强调哪一面，都难免片面。
