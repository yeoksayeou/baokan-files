Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 4th: The cemetery of Huang Daopo, a 13th-century female textile expert in China, has recently been completed in her hometown of Wunijing, near Shanghai.

　　Seven hundred years ago, farmers in Shanghai and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River did not know how to plant cotton, spin yarn, or weave cloth. Although cotton seeds were later introduced from the south, the weaving technology was still very primitive. Huang Daopo, who had previously lived in Yazhou (Hainan Island), brought the textile technology from there back to her hometown in 1296. She manufactured a complete set of textile tools, improved the spinning wheel that could only spin one thread into a new type of spinning wheel that could spin three threads at a time, and also created various methods for weaving patterned cloth. Huang Daopo's tremendous innovation in textile technology quickly spread throughout Shanghai and even the Jiangnan area. At that time, more than a thousand families in the Wunijing area were engaged in textile production. The cotton cloth woven under Huang Daopo's instruction had delicate patterns and beautiful colors.

　　After Huang Daopo died, the local people built tombs and temples for her. Later, when young girls learned to weave, they often went to Huangpo Temple to kowtow, believing that doing so would make their hands and feet nimble. However, over the centuries, due to repeated wars, Huang Daopo's tomb and temple had been completely destroyed. After repeated investigations, the People's Government determined the original site of her tomb and rebuilt the cemetery.

### 十三世纪女纺织家黄道婆墓园修建完工

    十三世纪女纺织家黄道婆墓园修建完工
    新华社上海4日电　我国十三世纪女纺织家黄道婆的墓园，最近在她的家乡上海市附近的乌泥泾修建完工。
    七百年前，上海和长江下游的农民还不会植棉和纺纱、织布，以后虽从南方传入了棉种，但纺织的技术还十分低劣。早年曾经流落崖州（海南岛）的黄道婆，在1296年把那儿的纺织技术带回到故乡。她制造了成套的纺织工具，把只能纺一根纱的踏车改进成一手纺三纱的新式踏车，还创造了各式花布的织法。黄道婆对纺织技术的巨大革新，很快就传遍了上海以至江南各地。乌泥泾一带当时就有一千多家人家从事纺织生产；由黄道婆的传授而织成的棉布，图案细致，色彩美丽。
    黄道婆死后，当地人民曾为她建墓立庙。以后小姑娘学纺织，往往先到黄婆庙去磕头，传说这样就能手脚灵巧。但是几百年来，几经战乱，黄道婆的墓和庙都已荡然无存。人民政府经过多次考查，勘定了她的坟墓的原址，重建了墓园。
