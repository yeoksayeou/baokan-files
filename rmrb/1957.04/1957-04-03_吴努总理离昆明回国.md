Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 2nd — The Prime Minister of the Union of Burma, U Nu, and Deputy Prime Minister Sao Khun Cho, concluded their friendly visit to Kunming of eleven days and departed Kunming by special plane this morning to return home.

Daw Khin Kyi, wife of Aung San, and U Kyaw Khim, Parliamentary Secretary of the Ministry of Shan State Affairs of Burma, also returned home at the same time.

Before dawn, crowds gathered at Kunming Airport to see off Prime Minister U Nu. The national flags of China and Burma fluttered in the morning glow. After Prime Minister U Nu, accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai, reviewed the guard of honor, he came to the farewell crowd and waved goodbye to the people of all ethnic groups in Kunming. At this time, more than 3,000 people waved the national flags of China and Burma and cheered slogans of Sino-Burmese friendship. Girls of various ethnic groups continuously presented flowers to Prime Minister U Nu, Deputy Prime Minister Sao Khun Cho, and Daw Khin Kyi. The cry of "Goodbye" was heard from the crowd from time to time.

Premier Zhou Enlai spoke, saying: "We are very happy to be able to see off Prime Minister U Nu and his companions in Kunming, Yunnan Province. The people of China and Burma like to call the relationship between the two peoples as a relationship of 'compatriots' and 'Pauk-Phaw'. Prime Minister U Nu came to Kunming this time to rest and also to visit relatives. I hope that the kinship between our two countries will continue to develop, and I hope that Prime Minister U Nu will often come to visit relatives. At the same time, we will also often go to Burma to visit our relatives."

Premier Zhou Enlai said: "Every time Prime Minister U Nu comes to China, there is a new increase and strengthening of the friendly relations between China and Burma. Similarly, through Prime Minister U Nu's visit this time, the friendly relations between China and Burma and world peace have been further strengthened." Premier Zhou Enlai finally wished Prime Minister U Nu, Deputy Prime Minister Sao Khun Cho, and Daw Khin Kyi good health and a safe journey.

Prime Minister U Nu then spoke, saying that through this visit, Sino-Burmese friendship has been further developed. Therefore, this was a very beneficial visit. The speeches of the two Premiers were interrupted by warm applause from time to time. More than 3,000 people and Premier Zhou Enlai and Prime Minister U Nu shouted slogans such as "Long live Sino-Burmese friendship."
