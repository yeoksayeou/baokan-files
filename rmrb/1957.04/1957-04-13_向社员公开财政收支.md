Publicizing Financial Income and Expenditure
Eliminated Ideological Doubts

    On March 21st, the Beilian Village Victory Agricultural Cooperative in Dingxing County, Hebei Province, publicized the financial income and expenditure, final account distribution, and financial income and expenditure accounts for January and February of this year to all commune members. They also checked and publicized the economic accounts of each household with the commune members.

    The cooperative's accounts for last year had not been publicized in a timely manner by mid-March of this year. Although a list was posted at the time of the year-end final account, it was only a summary of income and expenditure, which commune members said they could not understand, suspecting that the cooperative cadres were "getting a cut," which dampened their enthusiasm for production. Based on this situation, the cooperative's management committee, with the assistance of the village rectification work team, carefully settled the accounts and convened a general meeting of all commune members to publicize them, thus dispelling the commune members' doubts. At the same time, the cooperative also decided to publicize the financial income and expenditure situation to all commune members once a month in the future in order to obtain the supervision of the vast number of commune members.

    After the Victory Cooperative did this, the commune members were very satisfied. They said: "With this, we have a clear understanding, and we will be more motivated to produce."

Blocked Loopholes for Embezzlement

    The Huaguang Agricultural Cooperative in Guoyang County, Anhui Province, has eliminated undesirable phenomena such as embezzlement and misappropriation of public funds by publicizing accounts. Recently, based on the opinions of the commune members, the cooperative organized an account publicity team to carry the account books to each team for publicity and to check them household by household. During the account verification, it was discovered that individual production team statisticians and production team leaders had overstated the amount of advance payments on the commune members' advance payment accounts in order to embezzle funds. At the same time, it was also discovered that some people were not recording the sale of grain and cotton. After these embezzled funds were discovered, they were all recovered. The commune members were very happy and said: "This time, the knot in our hearts has been untied. As long as the accounts are clear, we are willing to work a little harder."

Inspired Commune Members to Increase Production

    The National Unity Agricultural Cooperative in Chenglou Township, Ningling County, Henan Province, has greatly inspired the production enthusiasm of commune members by adhering to the practice of regularly publicizing accounts to commune members.

    In order to achieve daily clearing and monthly settlement of accounts and financial transparency, the Party branch thoroughly reversed the cadres' thinking that they did not pay attention to financial work. The cooperative's economic director is specifically responsible for leading the cooperative's financial work. The team leaders also strengthened their assistance and supervision of the accountants. The accountants of the cooperative and the teams clarified their responsibilities, and whoever was responsible for the accounts was responsible for publicizing them. From March of last year to the end of February of this year, the cooperative publicized current accounts, work point accounts, and sideline accounts eleven times each to the commune members, and publicized the general accounts three times to the commune member representatives. The commune members are very satisfied with this work of the cooperative and have been encouraged to work harder.

Commune Members Care About the Cooperative's Economy

    After the Jinsha Agricultural Cooperative in Minqing County, Fujian Province, implemented financial transparency, the commune members actively cared about the cooperative's economy.

    Last year, due to the imperfect financial system and the fact that a few cooperative cadres monopolized financial power, the commune members did not understand the cooperative's economic situation, and everyone was afraid of being at a disadvantage, so they scrambled to borrow money from the cooperative, resulting in 75% of the commune members overdrawing more than 6,000 yuan of the cooperative's public funds, and more than 2,300 work points of the commune members were also in error. This year, the cooperative learned from last year's lessons and implemented financial transparency. The commune members were greatly encouraged and more consciously cherished public property and jointly managed the cooperative with diligence and frugality. According to the February inspection, the office expenses of all twelve production teams in the cooperative saved another 42.7% within the contracted standard. In the two months since the economic transparency was implemented, no accounting errors have been found in the teams.

Helped the Cooperative Solve Difficulties

    The "May 1st" Agricultural Cooperative in Xianyou County, Fujian Province, kept the cooperative's general accounts clear on a daily and monthly basis and publicized them regularly. The accounts of the production teams were divided into three types: labor work points, cash and in-kind transactions, and investment and equity funds, which were publicized to households on a monthly basis, checked with commune members, and errors were corrected in a timely manner. If there were major expenses or economic difficulties, the opinions of the commune members were solicited publicly and resolved through joint consultation. As a result, the commune members trusted and cherished the cooperative even more.

    向社员公开财政收支
    解除了思想疑虑
    河北省定兴县北连村胜利农业社，在3月21日，向全体社员公布了去年财务收支、决算分红和今年一、二月份的财务收支账目，对社员的经济往来账目也逐户进行了核对和公布。
    这个社去年的账目，到今年3月中旬，都没有及时公布过，年终决算时虽贴出清单，只是几笔收支总账，社员反映看不明白，怀疑社干部是“经手三分肥”，生产情绪不高。社管理委员会根据这种情况，在整社工作组的协助下，认真结算账目，并召开全体社员大会，向全体社员公布，因而解除了社员们的怀疑。同时，社里还确定今后每月向全体社员公布一次财务收支情况，以便取得广大社员的监督。
    胜利社这样作了以后，社员非常满意，他们说：这样作，心里有了数，生产也就起劲了。
    堵塞了贪污漏洞
    安徽省涡阳县华光农业社，通过公布账目，杜绝了贪污、挪用公款等不良现象。这个社最近根据社员的意见，组织了公布账目小组，携带账簿到各队公布，并挨户核对。在核对账目中，发现个别生产队的统计员、生产队长，在社员预支账上多开预支数目，从中贪污；同时，也发现有卖粮食、棉花不上账等情况。这些被贪污的款子经查出来以后，都追了回来。社员们十分高兴地说：这一回，可把我们心里的疙瘩解开了。只要账目清，就是做活累一点也情愿。
    鼓舞社员加劲生产
    河南省宁陵县程楼乡民族团结农业社，坚持定期向社员公布账目，大大鼓舞了社员的生产积极性。
    为了做到账目日清月结、财务公开，党支部彻底扭转了干部不重视财务工作的思想。社经济主任专门负责领导全社的财务工作。各队队长也加强对会计员的帮助和督促。社和队的会计，明确职责范围，谁负责的账由谁公布。自去年3月到今年2月底，全社共向社员公布往来账、工分账、副业账各十一次，向社员代表公布总账三次。社员对社里这项工作非常满意，并且鼓舞了大家的劳动积极性。
    社员关心社的经济
    福建闽清县金沙农业社实行财政公开后，社员们都积极关心社的经济。
    去年，这个社由于财务制度不健全和少数社干部独揽财权，社员不了解社内经济状况，大家都怕吃亏，便争着向社借款，结果有75％的社员超支了社里公款六千多元，而社员的劳动工分也被差错了两千三百多分。今年，社里吸取去年教训，实行财政公开，社员受了很大鼓舞，更加自觉地爱护公共财产，共同勤俭办社。据2月份检查，全社十二个生产队的办公费在包干标准内又节约了42.7％。经济公开两个月来，队里没有发现记账差错。
    帮助社解决困难
    福建省仙游县“五一”农业社全社大账做到日清月结，定期公布；生产队里的账目，分为劳动工分、现款实物往来、投资和股份基金等三种账，按月公布到户，同社员核对，及时纠正差错。如有重大开支或者经济困难，还公开征求社员意见，共同协商解决。这样作的结果是，社员更加信任和爱护合作社了。
