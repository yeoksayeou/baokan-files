Spring plowing is underway ahead of schedule

This year, spring in northern Vietnam is a rainy one.

Drizzling rain has been falling for nearly two months. In previous years, this was the driest season, but this year many areas are filled with water. Responding to the call of the Vietnamese Labor Party and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, farmers are carrying out spring plowing and rice transplanting early, and some areas have already completed this year's spring plowing tasks ahead of schedule. Son Tay province, west of Hanoi, has planted 498 hectares more of early rice this year than last year. Son Tay province is a semi-plain, semi-mountainous province with uneven terrain. Several consecutive heavy rains or seven or eight days without rain can cause many areas to be flooded or drought-stricken. Summing up past experiences, relevant departments in the province have adopted a policy of combining drainage and water storage, and have planned to drain the accumulated water from the flooded fields last year to designated storage areas, solving the irrigation water problem for 8,967 hectares of early rice fields, resulting in the early realization of the spring plowing plan.

Water conservancy projects on the Red River bank

On the banks of the Red River, a large-scale water conservancy project with hydroelectric station equipment, the Lam Thao-Hac Tri water conservancy irrigation project, has recently been completed. This project is one of the several large-scale water conservancy projects newly built in the north after the war. Construction began in late July last year, and thanks to the active efforts of workers and technicians, various difficulties were overcome and the task was completed on schedule. After the completion of the Lam Thao-Hac Tri water conservancy irrigation project, it can divert water from the Red River to irrigate nearly 15,000 Vietnamese acres of land (each Vietnamese acre is equivalent to 5.5 Chinese mu) in two counties, adding a large area of double-cropping rice fields to the north.

The fishing season has arrived

With the arrival of spring, the fishing season has also arrived on the coast of northern Vietnam.

Nguyen Nhat Hoi's fishing group in Hai Dong commune, Hai Hau district, Nam Dinh province, caught 245 dan of fish in a recent fishing trip. After paying boat rental and other expenses, each group member received 350,000 Vietnamese dong (approximately 200 RMB).

The Ngo Ho fishing production group in Ngu Thuy commune, Le Thuy district, Quang Binh province, not far from the 17th parallel north, caught a large shark in a recent outing. It was 8 meters long and weighed 1,500 kilograms, selling for more than 300,000 dong. According to experienced fishermen, this year may be a bumper year for fisheries along the northern coast.

Salt farmers have high morale

Nam Dinh salt region, the most important salt region in northern Vietnam, is experiencing high morale among salt farmers this year because the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has taken active measures to support them and appropriately increase purchase prices. Various preparations are being made earlier than in previous years. As a result, the 40 lime kilns in Giao Thuy and Hai Hau counties that supply lime for repairing and paving salt fields are particularly busy at present.

The Nam Dinh salt region has more than 13,000 salt farmer households, owning more than 1,600 Vietnamese acres of salt fields, and can produce more than 50,000 tons of sea salt annually. During the Anti-French Resistance War, it suffered from the devastation of the French colonialists, salt production was very low, and the lives of salt farmers were not guaranteed. After the restoration of peace, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam immediately allocated 500 million dong to build a 20-kilometer-long dike to protect the salt fields; at the same time, it also issued 80 million dong in loans and organized production, supply, and sales work; especially after being hit by a typhoon last year, the government actively helped salt farmers to repair the damaged salt fields so that they could continue production. The annual settlement of production could still reach 82% of the original plan, and the average income per person was approximately equivalent to more than 700 kilograms of grain. Last year, the government also specially established a hospital with more than 50 beds in the salt area, and this year it has actively increased the purchase price of sea salt, which has directly stimulated the production enthusiasm of salt farmers.　Our reporter

### 越南北方的春天

    越南北方的春天
    春耕提前进行
    今年，越南北方的春天，是一个多雨的春天。
    毛毛的细雨连续下了将近两个月了。往年这个时候是最干旱的季节，但是今年很多地区田野里都充满着水。农民们响应越南劳动党和越南民主共和国政府的号召，趁早进行春耕插秧工作，有些地方已经提前完成了今年的春耕任务。河内西面的山西省，今年播种早稻的面积比去年多了四百九十八公顷。山西省是个半平原半山区的省份，地势高低不平，连续下几场大雨或七、八天不下雨，便会使许多地方被涝或受旱。总结了过去的经验，省里有关部门采取排涝和蓄水相结合的方针，有计划地把去年受涝田里的积水排除到一定地方储蓄起来，解决了八千九百六十七公顷早稻田的灌溉用水，结果使春耕计划得以提前实现。
    红河岸兴修水利
    在红河边上，一个带有蓄电站设备的大型水利工程、临洮—鹤池水利灌溉工程，在最近竣工了。这个工程是北方战后新建的几个大型水利工程中的一个，自去年7月下旬开始兴建，由于工人和技术人员的积极努力，终于克服了各种困难如期完成任务。临洮—鹤池水利灌溉工程建成后，即可引导红河的水灌溉两个县将近一万五千越亩田（每越亩折合中国五点五市亩），从此北方又增加了一大片两季稻田。
    渔汛期又到了
    随着春天的到来，越南北方沿海的渔汛期也到来了。
    南定省海后县海东乡阮日会的捕鱼组，在最近一次出海捕鱼中，就捕获了二百四十五担鱼，除了缴纳船租等费用外，每个组员分得三十五万元（越币，约等于人民币二百多元）。
    离北纬十七度线不远的广平省，丽水县鱼水乡的吴呼渔业生产组，在最近的出海中捕获了一条大鲨鱼，身长八公尺、体重一千五百公斤，共卖得三十多万元。据有经验的渔民说，今年北方沿海，可能是渔业丰产年。
    盐民生产情绪高
    越南北方最重要的盐区——南定盐区，因为越南民主共和国政府采取积极扶助和适当提高收购价格等措施，今年盐民的生产情绪很高，各种准备工作都比往年来得早，因此交陲、海后两县为供应修铺盐场用灰的四十家灰窑，目前工作特别忙碌。
    南定盐区共有一万三千多户盐民，拥有一千六百多越亩盐田，每年可产海盐五万吨以上。抗战时遭受法国殖民者的摧残，盐产很低，盐民生活毫无保障。和平恢复后，越南民主共和国政府立即拨出五亿元修筑了一条长达二十公里的堤坝，以保护盐田；同时还发放八千万元贷款和组织产供销工作；特别去年遭受台风袭击后，政府积极帮助盐民抢修被破坏的盐田，使其继续生产。年终结算产量还能达到原计划的82％，平均每口人收入约等于七百多公斤谷子。去年政府还特别在盐区里设立了一座拥有五十多个床位的医院，今年又主动地提高了海盐的收购价格，这些都直接刺激了盐民的生产积极性。　本报记者
