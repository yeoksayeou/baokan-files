    Four-Wheeled Carts Carry More Goods

    On the morning of March 29th, nineteen new-style four-wheeled carts, converted from ordinary two-wheeled carts, underwent a demonstration transport at a grain warehouse in Tianjin. These carts, which before technical modification could only carry two and a half tons, are now loaded with four tons of grain.

    The shafts of these modified carts have now become simple drawbars, greatly reducing the pressure on the horses. Coupled with the stable cart body and the large inertia during travel, they can pull an extra ton and a half of goods without appearing heavy, using the same two or three animals as before.

    This type of cart was designed by Zhang Shengsen, a cadre of the Tianjin Transportation Company. Tianjin's horse-drawn cart transportation cooperatives plan to modify one hundred and fifty such four-wheeled carts this year.

    四轮马车装货多
    3月29日上午，十九辆由普通两轮马车改装成的新式四轮马车，在天津市一个粮食仓库的货场上进行了观摩运输。这些在进行技术改造前只能装两吨半的马车，现在都装上了四吨粮食。
    这些经过改装的马车的车辕现在变成了单纯的牵引杆，马身上的压力大大减轻了，加上车身稳，行车时惯性大，和过去一样还是用两匹或三匹牲口拉，就能多拉一吨半货物而不显得重。
    这种马车是天津市运输公司干部张盛森设计的。天津市各马车运输合作社计划在今年改装一百五十辆这样的四轮马车。
