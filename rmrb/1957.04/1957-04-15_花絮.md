    Anecdotes
    "No Way" "What to Do"
    In the home of a resident of Jerusalem, a pair of twins were born. The father was unemployed, already had three children, and was struggling financially. He was very angry and named his twins "No Way" and "What to Do," respectively. Later, after repeated persuasion from relatives and friends, he abandoned his original idea and renamed them "Good Morning" and "Goodbye."
    "Clever" Editor
    A magazine in Ontario, Canada, made the following statement to its readers: "Because some readers enjoy finding typos in newspapers and magazines, this publication, to meet the needs of all types of readers, occasionally makes mistakes in typesetting. Please forgive us."
    Odd Shapes
    A US senator received a letter from a female high school student. The letter said: "My friends all like to collect photos of movie stars, but my hopes are different. Please send me a dozen photos of senators, but please choose them carefully, because the appearances of senators are mostly odd, and even the most outstanding are no exception."

    花絮
    “没奈何”“怎么办”
    在耶路撒冷城一位居民的家里，诞生了一双孪生子。父亲是失业的人，已经有了三个孩子，生活困难。他很生气地给他的孪生子分别取名为“没奈何”，“怎么办”。后来经过亲友再三劝解，才打消原议，重新给他们命名为“早安”与“再会”。
    “聪明”的编辑
    加拿大安大略省一家杂志向读者作了以下的声明：“由于部分读者欢喜在报刊上发现错字，本刊为迎合各种读者的需要，在排印上，时有错误，尚希见谅。”
    奇形怪状
    美国一位参议员收到一个中学的女学生的来信。信里说：“我的朋友们都欢喜收集电影明星的照片，可是我的希望与众不同。请你寄一打参议员的照片给我，不过，请你仔细挑选一下，因为参议员的相貌大都是奇形怪状的，连最出众的也不能例外。”
