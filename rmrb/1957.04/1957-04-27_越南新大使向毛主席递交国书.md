Xinhua News Agency, April 26th: The newly appointed Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to China, Nguyen Khang, accompanied by Counselor Zhou Liang and other diplomats, presented his credentials to Chairman Mao Zedong of the People's Republic of China this evening.

Present at the presentation of credentials were Zhang Hanfu, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs; Yu Xinqing, Director of the Bureau of Ceremonies of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; Zhang Wenjin, Director of the Asian Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and Zhang Shijie, Deputy Director of the Protocol Department.

Ambassador Nguyen Khang's Speech

In his speech when presenting his credentials, Ambassador Nguyen Khang said to Chairman Mao Zedong: "For a long time, the people of Vietnam and China have been closely linked together in brotherly, sincere friendship and cooperation.

The Vietnamese people express their deep gratitude to the Chinese people and government for their warm support in the cause of the Vietnamese national liberation struggle and their significant contribution to the restoration of peace in Indochina; and especially for their sincere assistance to the Vietnamese people and government in restoring the national economy and developing culture since the restoration of peace.

The Vietnamese people have always followed the socialist construction cause of the Chinese people with deep affection, and are immensely delighted with the great achievements made by the Chinese people on all fronts, which have laid a reliable foundation for safeguarding peace in Asia and the world.

The Vietnamese people and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam attach great importance to its friendship and unity with the People's Republic of China and the countries of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union. And it is clearly recognized that continuously consolidating and developing this friendly relationship on the basis of proletarian internationalism is an extremely powerful support for the Vietnamese people in carrying out national construction and struggling for the unification of Vietnamese territory."

Chairman Mao Zedong's Reply

In his reply, Chairman Mao Zedong said: "After the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Vietnamese people persisted in eight years of arduous resistance against imperialist aggression and achieved a great victory. For more than two years since the restoration of peace, the Vietnamese people, under the leadership of the Vietnamese Labor Party and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, have also achieved great successes in the cause of economic recovery and construction. I believe that the Vietnamese people will surely achieve new and greater victories in the future development of the national economy and the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

As Ambassador mentioned, for a long time, the people of China and Vietnam have been closely linked together in brotherly, sincere friendship and cooperation. Over the past few years the relations among our two peoples and governments have become increasingly close, and economic and cultural cooperation and exchanges in various forms have been expanded and developed. I am deeply convinced that the fraternal friendship between the people of China and Vietnam will be further consolidated and developed. This will not only be conducive to enhancing the prosperity and happiness of our two peoples, but also to strengthening the unity of the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union, as well as peace in Asia and the world."
