Introduction to the Wuhan Iron and Steel Works Refractory Material Factory and Coking and Chemical Plant

The refractory material factory, the first project to be built by the Wuhan Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise, currently has six projects under simultaneous construction. The refractory material factory has five workshops, including more than forty construction projects. Among them, the lime roasting workshop, which has already started construction, will be the first to be completed and put into production in order to meet the needs of the Wuhan Iron and Steel construction phase.

After the factory is completed, it will be able to produce tens of thousands of tons of refractory materials annually. Three types of refractory bricks (clay bricks, high alumina bricks, and silica bricks) are widely used and are frequently and heavily needed refractory materials for blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, coking furnaces, and other industrial furnaces in the Wuhan Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise.

After the factory is put into production, the various refractory materials produced will not only be sufficient for the Wuhan Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise's needs but will also be able to supply some to other factories and mines.

Another coking and chemical plant under construction includes five workshops. It will produce coke, gas, benzene, and tar. Coke will be supplied to the joint enterprise's blast furnaces for ironmaking, and gas will be supplied to open-hearth furnaces for steelmaking and other industrial furnaces for heating. Its chemical recovery workshop will also recover various by-products from the gas to make fertilizer, etc. The gas produced by this factory can also be supplied to nearby residential areas for cooking and heating at a low price in the future.

The production processes of both the coking and chemical plant and the refractory material factory are automated. For example, as soon as the coal-carrying train cars enter the factory area of the coking and chemical plant, they first drive into the car dumper room. At this time, the car dumper turns the car and the tracks together, pouring the coal into the hopper. Then, the automatic transportation system sends the coal to various production departments like flowing water, eventually turning it into coke.

Currently, the coking and chemical plant has one formal project and six auxiliary and affiliated projects under simultaneous construction.

    武钢耐火材料厂和炼焦化工厂介绍
    武汉钢铁联合企业首先开工兴建的耐火材料厂，目前已有六项工程在同时施工。耐火材料厂有五个车间，包括四十多个建设工程项目。其中已经开工的石灰焙烧车间，因为要适应武钢建设阶段的需要，将首先建成和投入生产。
    这个工厂建成后，每年能生产数以万吨计的耐火材料。其中的三种耐火砖（粘土砖、高铝土砖、硅砖）用途很广，是武汉钢铁联合企业里的高炉、平炉、炼焦炉和其他工业炉经常大量需要的耐火材料。
    这个厂投入生产以后生产的各种耐火材料，不仅足够武汉钢铁联合企业需用，还可以拿出一部分供给别的厂矿。
    另一开工的炼焦化工厂，包括五个车间。它将生产焦炭、煤气、苯类和焦油等。焦炭供给联合企业的高炉炼铁用，煤气供给平炉炼钢和其他工业炉加热用。它的化学收回车间还将回收煤气中的多种副产品，以制成肥田粉等等。这个厂生产的煤气，将来还可以廉价地供给附近的居住区烧饭、取暖。
    炼焦化工厂和耐火材料厂的生产过程都是自动化的。例如炼焦化工厂运煤的火车车皮一进入厂区，首先驶进翻车机室。这时，翻车机把车皮连同车轨一道翻个转身，将煤倾入漏斗，然后，自动运输系统就流水般将煤送到各个生产部门，最后制成焦炭。
    现在，炼焦化工厂已有一项正式工程以及六项辅助工程和附属工程在同时施工。
