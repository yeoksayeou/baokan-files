Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, April 19th: The western border of Yunnan Province is already experiencing the heat of summer, and the 170,000 Dai people of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture are celebrating their annual Water-Splashing Festival.

　　In the days leading up to the festival, Dai families have been busy preparing for its arrival. People take advantage of the cool mornings to gather in groups on the hills and fields to pick the blooming "Sang Jian" and jasmine flowers, which they use to decorate the flower houses where Buddha statues are enshrined. Housewives are busy grinding rice and steaming festival cakes wrapped in banana leaves to prepare for entertaining guests. Children have long been counting down the days to the festival, each holding a bamboo water gun, eagerly and unexpectedly squirting water at passers-by.

　　On the morning of the 13th, at the Putti Temple in Mangshi, the seat of the Autonomous Prefecture People's Committee, the sounds of elephant-foot drums and gongs filled the air. Dai Buddhists carried buckets of water and poured clear water into dragon-shaped water troughs. As the water flowed into the flower house, splashes of water flew everywhere, splashing onto the Buddha statues. Afterwards, people joyfully splashed water on each other, wishing each other good health and peace in all seasons.

　　Dai farmers from nearby villages, dressed in festive attire, with the girls wearing bright red flowers in their hair, were led by young men beating gongs and drums. Following their own established custom, they went to the Autonomous Prefecture People's Committee and various government offices to splash water and offer blessings. Cadres of various ethnic groups in the government offices also splashed water on each other to share the joy of the Dai people's festival. Leading figures from the Autonomous Prefecture's Party and government organs, cadres of various ethnic groups, and officers and soldiers of the border defense forces, all soaked to the skin, expressed their gratitude for the kindness of the Dai people. Whether cadres or residents, everyone was united in the water-splashing.

    傣族人民欢度泼水节
    新华社昆明19日电　云南省西部边疆已是炎暑时节，德宏傣族景颇族自治州十七万傣族人民欢度了一年一度的泼水节。
    在节日前夕，傣族人家早已为节日到来忙碌开了。人们趁着早晨凉爽的时刻，成群结队到山岗和田野去采撷盛开的桑建花和茉莉花，装饰供奉佛像的花房。主妇们忙着碾磨大米，蒸好芭蕉叶裹的节日糕点，准备款待客人。儿童们早已扳指数着节日来到的日子，他们人手一支竹制水筒，迫不及待地冷不防就向行人射水。
    13日清晨，在自治州人民委员会所在地芒市的普提寺里，象脚鼓和铓钹声喧天，傣族佛教徒提着水桶把清水倒进雕刻成龙形的水槽里，当水流到花房时，水花四溅、泼向佛像。以后，人们才欢乐地互相泼水，祝福彼此身体健康和四季平安无恙。
    从附近各村寨来的傣族农民，穿着盛装，姑娘们的发髻上还插鲜红花朵，由小伙子敲着锣鼓引导，按照群众自己形成的惯例，到自治州人民委员会和各机关泼水祝福。各族机关干部也互相泼水祝福，分享傣族人民节日的欢乐。自治州党政机关领导人、各民族干部、边防军军官和战士们，都浑身湿漉漉地感谢傣族人民的好心意。不论干部或居民，都在泼水中融成一片。
