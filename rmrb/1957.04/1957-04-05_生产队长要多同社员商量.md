Production Team Leader Should Consult More with Commune Members
Wang Boxing, New Min Production Team Leader, Xinle Agricultural Cooperative

Our New Min Production Team was formed in 1955. In the past year or so, our production leadership work has had many shortcomings due to lack of experience. However, by carefully learning from last year's experiences and lessons, fully promoting democracy in our work, and consulting with commune members on how to do things, we can accomplish many things that one person could not even imagine. Judging from the various aspects of this year's spring plowing preparations, I feel that being a production team leader is indeed easier than it was last year.

Let me start with the team's production plan for this year. Last year, when we made the plan, the commune members said we were "drawing circles to trap the masses." There was reason for the masses to say this. At that time, we did not consult with the masses at all, but simply shouted "Double-cropping rice must be planted on 42% (referring to the proportion of the total cultivated area), with a guaranteed yield of 1,000 jin per mu." As a result, the plan failed, the work was passive, and the masses were dissatisfied. This year, the formulation of the production plan is different: the cooperative gave us a preliminary plan, asking us to consult with the commune members. We held meetings of key members and member meetings in the team, asking everyone to criticize the shortcomings of blindly expanding double-cropping rice last year. While criticizing blind adventurism, we also criticized conservative thinking. Our team has six mu of double-cropping rice, which yielded 800 jin per mu last year. We discussed how to enable other double-cropping rice fields to achieve such high yields. Everyone believed that our team has good soil quality and sufficient fertilizer this year. Applying 40 dan of pig manure and 20 jin of chemical fertilizer per mu of double-cropping rice, there would be no problem in producing 800 jin. Based on its own conditions, our team reduced the double-cropping rice planting area from the 20% initially required by the cooperative to 13%, but the unit area yield increase targets for various crops were greatly increased. The average grain yield per mu for the whole year reached 684 jin, exceeding the standard proposed by the cooperative.

After formulating the production plan, we also implemented the "three guarantees and one reward system" to encourage commune members to work more and earn more, and strive for over-production rewards. The "three guarantees" work was not done well last year, so some people said: why bother with it this year? Later, we also explained at the members' meeting that this year's guarantees must be reasonable and must be resolutely implemented. After the indicators of guaranteed work, guaranteed output, and guaranteed cost were discussed by the commune members, the commune members also had confidence in striving for over-production. In order to strengthen the commune members' sense of responsibility, while implementing the "three guarantees", we also reasonably contracted agricultural work suitable for contracting to small teams or individuals, such as water lifting, weeding, harrowing, wheat field management, cattle raising, and farm boat keeping, to individual commune members or small teams. Some commune members said that this year we can definitely do a better job of ensuring more work for more pay and clear rewards and punishments.

After the implementation of the "three guarantees", not only are the commune members more enthusiastic, but we also no longer need to "assign work early, evaluate work late, and argue until the east is red", so we can participate more in production. Our team's households are scattered, three li long from north to south. If I run two or three times a day, I don't have much time to participate in production. Therefore, I only worked eighty labor days last year. This year, the leadership called on cadres to go to the fields. Peng Xingyu, the branch secretary of the township and the director of our cooperative, has gone to the fields to produce, and I have also participated in production. From the beginning of the year to now, I have already worked sixty-odd labor days in more than two months. In this way, there are also better ways to lead production.

To do a good job in the production of the production team, everyone must be of one mind. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on ideological education. The first team in our brigade used to be a mutual aid group. At the beginning of last year, they joined the advanced cooperative, were not used to collective labor, and had opinions on the cooperative's distribution last year. At the beginning of this year, ten households were unwilling to go to the fields for production for a month. The rich middle peasant Qian Chuan'ying wanted to withdraw from the cooperative, and Qian Chuan'tao, an "overdraft household", did not have enough food, and his emotions were also fluctuating. At that time, I ran to the homes of Qian Chuan'tao and Qian Chuan'ying, helped them calculate accounts, gave Qian Chuan'tao an advance of more than a month's rations from the cooperative, and also reviewed the shortcomings of the cooperative's income distribution work last year. After doing this, they were more satisfied and participated in production. Now, more than ninety laborers in the team, eighty-five are participating in production activities such as building canals, soaking seeds and promoting germination, and weeding rice paddies. On March 24, the attendance rate almost reached 100%.

### 生产队长要多同社员商量

    生产队长要多同社员商量
    新乐农业社新民生产队队长  王伯兴
    我们新民生产队是1955年组成的。一年多以来，我们的生产领导工作，因为没有经验，有了许多缺点。但是，好好吸取去年的经验教训，在工作中充分发扬民主，多同社员商量办事，就可以办好一个人想不到办不好的许多事情。从今年准备春耕工作的种种情况看来，我感到生产队长倒是比去年好当一些了。
    让我先从队里今年订生产计划谈起吧。去年制定计划，社员说我们是“做好圈子套在群众头上”。群众这样说也有理由。那时，我们根本没有和群众商量，只是叫喊“双季稻要种42％（指占耕地总面积的比例），每亩包产一千斤”。结果，计划落空，工作被动，群众不满。今年制定生产计划就不同了：社里交给我们一个初步方案，要我们跟社员商量。我们在队里先后开了骨干会和队员大会，让大家对去年盲目扩大双季稻的缺点提出批评。在批判盲目冒进的同时，又批判了保守思想。我们队里有六亩双季稻，去年亩产八百斤。我们就讨论如何使其他的双季稻田也能达到这样高的产量。大家认为：我们这个队土质好，今年肥料又足，每亩双季稻施四十担猪粪、二十斤化学肥料，产八百斤没有问题。我们队根据自己的条件，把双季稻种植面积从社里最初要求的20％缩小到13％，但各项农作物的单位面积增产指标，却大大提高了。全年平均每亩粮食产量达六百八十四斤，超过了社里提出的准标。
    制定生产计划以后，我们又推行了“三包一奖制”，鼓励社员多劳多得，争取超产奖励。“三包”工作去年没搞好，于是有人说：今年还包它做什么？后来，我们也在队员大会上说明：今年要包得合理，并且一定坚决执行。包工包产包成本的指标经社员讨论以后，社员对于争取超产也有信心了。为了加强社员的责任心，在推行“三包”的同时，我们又把适宜于包给小队或个人的农活，如车水、锄田、耙田、麦田管理、养牛和保管农船等，合理包给社员个人或小队。有的社员说，今年一定可以更好地做到多劳多得、奖罚分明了。
    实行“三包”以后，不仅社员劲头大，我们也再不用“早派工、晚评功，吵到东方红”，可以多参加生产了。我们这个队住户分散，南北有三里长，我每天跑二、三趟，就没有很多参加生产的时间了。因此，我去年只做了八十个劳动日。今年领导上号召干部下田，乡的支部书记、本社主任彭兴余都下田生产了，我也参加了生产，从年初到现在，两个多月已经做了六十几个劳动日。这样，领导生产也更有办法了。
    要把生产队的生产搞好，一定要大家齐心。因此，就需要抓紧思想教育工作。我们大队里的第一小队过去是个互助组，去年初参加高级社，对集体劳动不习惯，对社里去年的分配有意见。今年年初就有十户人家，成月不肯下田生产。富裕中农钱川英想退社不干，“超支户”钱川桃粮食不够吃，情绪也动荡不定。那时候，我就跑到钱川桃、钱川英家里，帮他们算账，给钱川桃向社里预支了一个多月的口粮，对社里去年收益分配工作的缺点也作了检讨。这样做了以后，他们都比较满意地参加生产了。现在全队九十多个劳动力，有八十五个参加筑渠道、浸种催芽、锄秧田等生产行动。3月24日这一天，出勤率几乎达到100％。
