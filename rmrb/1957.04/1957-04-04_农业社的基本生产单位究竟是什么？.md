What Exactly is the Basic Production Unit of an Agricultural Cooperative?
Tang Anzhong

The size of the production unit of an agricultural cooperative is extremely closely related to maximizing the superiority of collective production, adapting to the current level of management, and enabling members to supervise each other and engage in production consciously.

Some comrades believe that the basic production unit of an agricultural cooperative should be the production team, and therefore, contracting work and setting output quotas must be assigned to the team. I have a different understanding of this view. I believe that based on the specific conditions of agricultural production in our country today, the basic production unit of an agricultural cooperative should be the production group, and contracting work and setting output quotas must also be assigned to the group. My reasons are: The division of production units should first consider adapting to the productive forces so that the productive forces can be fully utilized. According to the situation in Shuanglin Township, Hang County, Zhejiang Province, for general farm work such as plowing and rice transplanting, the collaboration of four or five laborers is sufficient. More would result in a waste of time on the road due to "people coming and going." The largest field collaboration operation is water-wheeling, which requires seven or eight people; if it is drought-resistant rice transplanting, water-wheeling and transplanting at the same time require eleven or twelve people. Therefore, a production unit with fourteen or fifteen laborers (including women) can do everything. Such a production unit is a group.

Most agricultural cooperatives in our country have only been around for one or two years. Both members and cadres lack experience in collective management, and some people are not very accustomed to it. The inherent mentality of the small-scale peasant economy and the habits of small-scale peasant management often unconsciously hinder the progress of collective management. At this time, if the unit of collective production is too large, the contradiction between the small-peasant mentality and collective management will be greater, and management will also be more difficult. Therefore, the form of production groups is currently suitable for both the demands of the members and the leadership level of the cadres. At the same time, from the perspective of human relationships, because the group is small in scope and lives relatively concentrated, the members of the group are either relatives or close neighbors, and they have always been relatively familiar with each other, making it easier to coordinate in production.

Also, because the scope of the group is small, the relationship of interests is obvious, and each member can see it clearly. Everyone can see the differences between groups more clearly, making it easy to stimulate the active competition of each group in production. During the rice transplanting period last year in the agricultural cooperative of Shuanglin Township, Hang County, some backward groups, seeing clearly that many groups had run ahead of them, greatly stimulated their enthusiasm for production, and they quickly caught up and completed the rice transplanting task quickly.

Of course, if a cooperative has dozens of production groups, it would be very inconvenient if the cooperative directly led them, as there would be too many things to handle. Therefore, in 1955, the agricultural cooperative of Shuanglin Township adopted the method of "two-level contracting," that is, first the cooperative contracted to the team, and then the team contracted to the group. In this way, the management committee only needs to focus on a few teams, and the teams then focus on a few groups. The team is basically divided according to natural villages, which is convenient for leadership. Because the groups within the team have common interests, the groups always supervise and help each other. The team leader takes turns working in each group in the team. When he sees that a group is lagging behind, he works a few more days in that group. This ensures that the groups are generally balanced and progress together. However, the group is still the basic production unit.

For a large cooperative, in addition to field work, there are many non-field chores, such as repairing warehouses, farm tools, livestock sheds, selling or buying supplies to supply and marketing cooperatives, etc. Who does these things? At the beginning, the agricultural cooperative of Shuanglin Township, Hang County, drew people from each group; but it was difficult to draw people during the busy farming season. Therefore, later, a "mobile group" was established to take on these non-field chores or to cope with temporary needs in the field.

The cooperative generally carries out basic construction in winter or early spring. At that time, there is less field production, and the cooperative can make unified plans and temporarily break the original scope of contracting according to needs and reorganize.

I say that the basic production unit of an agricultural cooperative should be the group, and that contracting work and setting output quotas should be assigned to the group, based on the actual situation of the productive forces and management level of general agricultural cooperatives at present. Only after the productive forces and management level have been significantly improved can the production unit be gradually expanded. At the same time, it must be understood that contracting work and setting output quotas is a very detailed organizational task, and it is difficult to do it perfectly in one or two years. It needs to gradually accumulate experience. Therefore, it should be stabilized for several years without change.

    农业社的基本生产单位究竟是什么？
    汤安中
    农业社的生产单位的大小，对于最大限度地发挥集体生产的优越性，对于如何适应现有的管理水平，对于通过社员互相督促、自觉地进行生产，有极密切的关系。
    有些同志认为农业社的基本生产单位应该是生产队，因此包工包产必须包到队。我对这种看法有不同的认识。我认为根据我国当前农业生产的具体情况来看，农业社的基本生产单位应该是生产小组，包工包产也必须包到小组。我的理由是：生产单位的划分，首先应该考虑到同生产力相适应，使生产力能充分发挥。根据浙江省杭县双林乡的情况来看，耕地、插秧等一般农活，有四、五个劳动力协作就够了，多了就会发生“人来人返”的路途上的时间浪费。最大的田间协作作业是车水，需要七、八个人；如果是天旱插秧，一边车水一边插，需要十一、二人。因此，一个生产单位有十四、五个劳动力（包括妇女）就什么活都能干了。这样的生产单位就是小组。
    我国的农业社大多数只有一、二年的历史，不论社员和干部，对于集体经营都缺乏经验，一部分人还不大习惯。固有的小农经济心理和小农经营习惯，还经常不自觉地阻碍着集体经营的进行。在这个时候，集体生产的单位过大，小农的心理和集体经营之间的矛盾就会更大，管理也比较困难。因此，生产小组的形式在目前既适合社员的要求，也适合社干部的领导水平。同时，从人的关系来看，由于小组范围小，居住较集中，小组内的成员不是本家就是近邻，一向比较了解，在生产上也比较容易协调一致。
    也由于小组范围小，利害关系明显，每个社员都可以看得明白。小组和小组之间的差别，大家也看得比较清楚，容易激发各组在生产上积极竞赛。杭县双林乡农业社在去年插秧期间，有一些落后的小组，由于明显地看到许多组跑到他们前面去了，大大地激发了他们的生产积极性，急起直追，迅速地完成了插秧任务。
    当然，一个社内有几十个生产小组，如果由社直接领导，头绪太多，很不方便。因此，双林乡农业社1955年采取了“两级包工”的办法，即首先由社包到队，再由队包到组。这样，管理委员会只需要抓几个队，队再抓几个组就行了。队基本上是按自然村划分，便于领导。因为队内各组有共同的利害关系，所以各组总是互相督促，互相帮助。队长轮流在队内各组劳动，他看到那个组差劲，就在那个组多做几天。这样就保证了各组间大体平衡，一同前进。但是，小组仍然是基本的生产单位。
    对于一个大社来说，除了田间作业以外，还有许多非田间作业的杂活，如修理仓库、农具、畜舍、向供销社销售或购买物资等。这些事情由谁干？杭县双林乡农业社开始的时候是向各组抽人；但到农忙的时候抽人很困难。于是，后来又成立了一个“机动组”，来担任这些非田间杂活或者应付田间的临时需要。
    社里进行基本建设，一般是在冬天或初春，那时候田间生产少，可以由社统一规划，根据需要，暂时打破原来的包工范围，重新组织。
    我说农业社的基本生产单位应该是小组，包工包产应该包到小组，是从目前一般农业社的生产力和管理水平的实际情况出发。当生产力和管理水平有显著提高之后，才可以逐渐扩大生产单位。同时，要知道包工包产是一个非常细致的组织工作，一、二年内很难做得很完善，需要逐渐积累经验，因此，应该稳定几年不变。
