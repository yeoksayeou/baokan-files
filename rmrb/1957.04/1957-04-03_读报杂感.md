Random Thoughts on Reading the Newspaper

Editor's Note: On April 2nd, this newspaper published a letter from Comrade Wu You in the "Letters from Readers" column on page three, titled "Is it Worth Praising?". On the same day, the editorial department received letters from some readers, expressing their opinions on Comrade Wu You's views. Now, we are selecting two letters to publish below.

This is a Commendable Behavior

After reading Comrade Wu You's letter "Is it Worth Praising?" published on page three of today's newspaper, I have a different opinion.

I believe that savings should be encouraged for both people with higher incomes and people with lower incomes. There are many benefits to participating in savings. Now, setting aside its significant importance for accumulating national construction funds, it also has great benefits for individuals. Savings can not only help people accumulate small amounts of money into larger amounts to meet necessary needs; it can also help people develop good habits of thrift and frugality. However, we must also admit that the lower the income, the smaller the possibility of saving. In this case, it is even more commendable for her to be able to budget carefully and save regularly. Therefore, I think housewife Ma Yueping's approach is worth praising. Everyone should learn from her spirit of thriftiness and active participation in savings.

Should Be Praised

Ma Yueping's careful budgeting and active participation in savings should be praised. People with higher incomes naturally live well and are more able to participate in savings. While it is certainly worth praising these people for participating in savings, it is even more worth praising those families with relatively low incomes who, due to proper planning and adherence to a hard-working and simple lifestyle, manage to save some money while maintaining a certain standard of living. It is wrong to think that Ma Yueping should not save because her family does not eat meat several times a month. There is a saying in our country: "Store up grain to prevent famine." Although the state frequently provides assistance and care to workers in need, if each of us can usually save some money to use in times of "special difficulty," then we can reduce some unnecessary expenses for the country, which is beneficial to accelerating the country's socialist construction.

    读报杂感
    编者按：4月2日本报三版“读者来信”栏发表了武友同志的一封来信，题目是“值不值得表扬”。当天，编辑部就收到一些读者来信，对武友同志的看法提出自己的意见。现在选登两封在下面。
    这是难能可贵的行为
    我读了今天你报三版发表的武友同志的来信“值不值得表扬”以后，有不同的意见。
    我认为不论对于收入比较多的人和收入比较少的人都应当提倡储蓄。参加储蓄的好处很多。现在我们撇开它对于积累国家建设资金的重大意义不谈，仅仅就它对于个人来说，也有很大好处。储蓄不仅可以帮助人们把零钱聚成整钱，以备必要时之需；同时还可以帮助人们养成俭朴和节约的良好习惯。但是，我们还该承认，收入越是比较少的人，储蓄的可能性也就越小。在这种情况下，她能够精打细算、经常储蓄，更是难能可贵。因此，我认为主妇马月平的做法是值得表扬的。大家都应该学习她那种勤俭持家和积极参加储蓄的精神。

    应该表扬
    马月平精打细算，积极参加储蓄，应该受到表扬。收入多的人，自然生活过得好，也更有条件参加储蓄。这种人参加储蓄固然值得表扬；但是，那些收入比较少的家庭，由于计划得当和坚持艰苦朴素的作风，在维持一定生活水平的情况下，设法节余一些钱来储蓄，就更值得表扬。如果认为马月平家一个月没有吃几次肉就不该储蓄，这是错误的。我国有句俗话说：“积谷防饥”。目前，虽然国家对职工的困难经常给以帮助和照顾，但是，如果我们每个人平常能储蓄些钱，以备“特殊困难”发生的时候用，那就可以为国家减少一些不必要的开支，这对加速国家的社会主义建设是有好处的。　　傅英
