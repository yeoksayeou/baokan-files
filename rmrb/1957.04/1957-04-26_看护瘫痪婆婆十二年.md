Caring for Paralyzed Mother-in-Law for Twelve Years

Xinhua News Agency reporter Yang Limen

Jin Suzhen, a family member of a worker at the First Rolling Mill on Friendship Street in Anshan City, is praised by her neighbors as a good and filial daughter-in-law. Jin Suzhen is the wife of Su Tingxiang, a worker at the First Rolling Mill, and is forty-four years old this year. In the tenth year after her marriage, her mother-in-law suddenly suffered from hemiplegia and has been bedridden ever since. Since then, in addition to taking care of her four children, Jin Suzhen has also had to take care of her mother-in-law, which has now been twelve years and three months.

For more than twelve years since her mother-in-law fell ill, she has been defecating and urinating in bed, but when you go to their house, you can't smell any bad odor. This is all because Jin Suzhen takes good care of her. Every time her mother-in-law defecates or urinates, Jin Suzhen cleans it up thoroughly. Last summer, the old lady got diarrhea and had even more bowel movements. Sometimes she couldn't go immediately, but Jin Suzhen stayed by her side, waiting until she finished and cleaned everything up. She also prepared three diapers for washing and changing at any time. In the hot summer weather, her mother-in-law often sweated, so Jin Suzhen often wiped her body with water.

People are always very depressed when they are sick, especially with paralysis where they can't move. In order to relieve her mother-in-law's boredom, Jin Suzhen often told her stories from comic books and acted out interesting plots from the plays she had seen, making her mother-in-law very happy. One day, there was a Yangko dance and waist drum performance outside, and her mother-in-law wanted to see it. However, the windowsill was high and blocked her view. Jin Suzhen used a table to prop her up, so that her mother-in-law could lie higher and see the excitement outside from the window.

Jin Suzhen has been patiently taking care of her mother-in-law day and night for more than twelve years. Her deeds have been widely praised and spread by neighbors and relatives, becoming an example for people to follow.

    看护瘫痪婆婆十二年
    新华社记者　杨礼门
    鞍山市友好街初轧厂职工家属金素珍，是在街坊邻居里被人们称赞的孝顺婆婆的好媳妇。金素珍是初轧厂工人苏庭香的爱人，今年已经四十四岁了。在她结婚后的第十个年头里，她的婆婆突然得了半身不遂的病，一直躺在床上。从那时候起，金素珍除了照顾四个孩子外还要侍候婆婆，到现在已经十二年零三个月了。
    婆婆病倒十二年多，全是在炕上拉屎撒尿，但是当你到他们屋子里的时候，一点臭味也闻不到。这都是金素珍侍候得好，婆婆每次拉屎撒尿，都由她擦得干干净净。去年夏天，老太太得了个拉肚子病，大小便的次数更多了，有时还不一定能立刻大小便，金素珍也守候在旁边，一直等到便完收拾干净为止。她还准备三块尿布随时给洗换。夏天天气热，婆婆身上经常出汗，金素珍就经常用水给擦洗。
    人在病里总是很烦闷的，特别是动也不能动的瘫痪病。金素珍为了给婆婆解闷，经常把小人书里的故事讲给婆婆听，把看过的戏里的有趣情节学给婆婆看，逗得婆婆高高兴兴的。一天，外面在扭秧歌、打腰鼓，婆婆听到了也要看看。但是窗台高，挡住了视线。金素珍就用桌子垫起来，使婆婆躺得高一些，从窗户里就可以看到外面的热闹。
    金素珍就是这样日日夜夜地耐心地侍候着婆婆十二年多。她的事迹被邻居和亲属们普遍地赞扬着、传颂着，成为人们的榜样。
