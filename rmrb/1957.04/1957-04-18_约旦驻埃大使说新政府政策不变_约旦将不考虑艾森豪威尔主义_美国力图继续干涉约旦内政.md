Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 17th: "People's Daily" reported on the 16th that the Jordanian Ambassador to Egypt, Dr. Mulqi, said in Cairo on the 15th: "Eisenhower's Middle East plan is bound to fail, and the new Jordanian government will not consider this plan." Mulqi has been appointed Minister of Education and Public Works in the new Jordanian cabinet.
    On the afternoon of the 15th, King Hussein called Dr. Mulqi to inform him of the composition of the new cabinet and told him that the new government's policies would be the same as those pursued by the recently resigned Nabulsi cabinet.
    The new Deputy Prime Minister, Sayed Mufti, said in a telephone interview with a "Republic News" reporter on the evening of the 15th that the Jordanian parliament would not be dissolved, and the constitution would not be suspended. He also said that the new government's policies would be the same as those of the Nabulsi cabinet.
    Xinhua News Agency, April 17th: News from Washington on the 16th revealed that the United States is actively preparing to continue interfering in Jordan's political situation. According to a United Press report, US Presidential Envoy Richards plans to go to Jordan next week or the week after to negotiate increasing US "economic assistance" in an attempt to strengthen the position of the pro-Western King of Jordan.
    There are also reports that US officials are watching the "political influence" of the new Jordanian cabinet formed by Halidi and are unwilling to regard the formation of the cabinet as "the end of the crisis in the Jordanian political situation."
    State Department spokesman White said on the 16th that the United States will "aid" Jordan if Jordan is subjected to so-called "aggression."
    Democratic Senator Mansfield also advocated giving King Hussein of Jordan "aid" at a press conference on the evening of the 15th. But he expressed concern about the plans of some people in the United States. He said that the US government may make "some explanation" of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" so that it can send troops to Jordan.

    约旦驻埃大使说新政府政策不变
    约旦将不考虑艾森豪威尔主义
    美国力图继续干涉约旦内政
    据新华社开罗17日电　“人民报”16日报道，约旦驻埃及大使穆尔基博士15日在开罗说：“艾森豪威尔的中东计划将必然地要遭到失败，约旦新政府将不会考虑这个计划。”穆尔基已经被任命为约旦新内阁的教育和公共工程大臣。
    15日下午，侯赛因国王曾经打电话给穆尔基博士，告诉他新内阁的组成情况，而且还对他说，新政府的政策将同最近辞职的纳布西内阁所奉行的政策一样。
    新内阁副首相赛义德·穆弗蒂15日晚上在电话中对“共和国报”记者发表谈话说，约旦议会将不会解散，宪法也不会暂停生效。他也说，新政府的政策将同纳布西内阁的政策一样。
    新华社17日讯　华盛顿16日透露出来的消息表明，美国正在积极准备继续干预约旦的政局。合众社消息说，美国总统特使理查兹打算在下星期或者再下星期到约旦去谈判增加美国的“经济援助”问题，设法来加强亲西方的约旦国王的地位。
    还有消息说，美国官员们正在注视着由哈利迪组成的约旦新内阁的“政治影响”，并且不愿意把内阁的组成“看成是约旦政局危机的结束”。
    国务院发言人怀特16日表示，美国将“援助”约旦，如果约旦受到所谓“侵略”的话。
    民主党参议员曼斯菲尔德15日晚上在记者招待会上也主张给予约旦国王侯赛因以“援助”。但是他对美国有些人士的策划表示不安。他说，美国政府可能对“艾森豪威尔主义”加以“某种解释”，以使它能派遣军队到约旦去。
