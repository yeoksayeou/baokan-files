The "Small Trough Feeding, Self-Use Self-Feeding" Method is Good
Shen Xianguang, Jin Baoting

    Given the current lack of collective livestock management experience in agricultural cooperatives, the CCP Suiping County Committee has universally promoted the livestock management experience of Yangdian Township throughout the county: "Whoever Raises Uses, Use and Raise Combined, Dedicated Personnel Responsible, Guarantee Use and Maintenance," greatly improving the condition of draft animal husbandry.

    When Yangdian Township in Suiping County established cooperatives, there were a total of 1,163 head of livestock in the township. Among them, 486 were female livestock, with approximately 360 being capable of reproduction. Over the past year, the vast majority have gained weight and reproduced 184 young livestock, accounting for approximately 51% of the number of female livestock capable of reproduction. If we add the 138 female livestock that are currently pregnant, they account for a total of 89.4% of the number of female livestock capable of reproduction. Currently, there are a total of 1,304 head of livestock of all sizes (in addition, 41 head were sold to disaster areas), an increase of 12% compared to last spring.

    The two methods of livestock management, "Large Trough Feeding, Others Use" and "Small Trough Feeding, Self-Use Self-Feeding," sparked sharp debates when establishing primary cooperatives. Many cooperative members advocated using the large communal trough method, saying that large trough feeding saves labor, reduces work-point expenses, provides uniform feeding, and does not delay work. What was the result? The mutual aid group led by Wei Qingde transitioned to a primary cooperative in the winter of 1953. All twenty head of livestock in the cooperative were fed collectively, using five feeders, each averaging four head. The feed was originally sufficient; in addition to feeding two pans of ground oilseed residue every three days, each of the fourteen cattle was also fed about twenty catties of grain daily, which should have fattened them up. However, because it was their feeding but others' use, others only cared about grabbing work points for themselves and didn't care about the livestock's well-being, so they became increasingly thin. By the time the wheat was almost ripe in 1954, everyone felt that they could no longer continue feeding them that way. After discussion, they immediately divided the livestock into small troughs, added three more feeders, and switched to self-use self-feeding, with dedicated personnel responsible. By doing so, the livestock quickly regained their weight. After Yangdian Primary Cooperative was established the winter before last, the livestock were again combined into large troughs, and the twenty-seven livestock in the Third Team were fed by only four people. Due to the excessive work done by others and poor feeding, thirteen died within four months. Therefore, when transitioning to an advanced cooperative last spring, no one advocated using the large communal trough method anymore, and they consciously adopted the self-use self-feeding, dedicated personnel responsible method.

    Based on local usage habits of cattle pulling carts (two cattle pulling one-bar carts), plowing and harrowing, and threshing, while donkeys and horses primarily pull mills, with auxiliary plowing, harrowing, planting, and threshing, they established different feeding management methods. First, the cattle were classified and implemented "Six Fixes," namely: (1) Fixed livestock pair: each pair consisting of two head, grouped according to male/female, size, and speed. (2) Fixed dedicated personnel for feeding and use: one person assigned to each pair of livestock to be responsible for both feeding and use to the end. (3) Fixed farm implements: farm implements such as carts, plows, harrows, harnesses, whips, etc., were rationally matched with the livestock and contracted for fixed use. If the contracted farm implements were damaged beyond the specified period, the team was responsible for repairing and adding to them; if damaged or lost within the specified period, the individual was fully responsible for compensation. (4) Fixed work points: one and a half work points were recorded daily for feeding a draft cattle; calves over eight months old received the same work points as feeding draft cattle. Additional work points were recorded when using the livestock. (5) Fixed cattle feed: during the busy farming season, two catties per head for large cattle and one and a half catties per head for second-class cattle daily; during the slack season, one catty per head for large cattle and ten ounces per head for second-class cattle daily. The principle for grass was to feed them until they were full. Each trough fed two head of cattle, and each feeding room generally fed four troughs. (6) Fixed manure: each pair of livestock turned in fourteen cartloads of manure to the cooperative monthly, with excess sold to the cooperative. Secondly, donkeys were distributed to households for feeding. Based on the household population, several households jointly fed and used them, with whoever fed receiving the work points. Thirdly, horses and mules were relatively difficult to feed, so feeders with higher feeding skills were assigned to be specially responsible for feeding, fixing work points, fixing grass feed, and fixing manure. All types of young livestock followed their mothers. Livestock treatment fees were contracted by the cooperative to the team, with the team uniformly managing their use.

    Experience has proven that the method of small trough feeding, self-use self-feeding, dedicated personnel responsible, and contracting to the end has many benefits: small trough feeding means fewer livestock per trough, more uniform and meticulous feeding, and better care; it greatly reduces livestock diseases and deaths; self-use self-feeding with dedicated personnel increases cooperative members' enthusiasm for loving their livestock, avoiding the tendency of others pulling and using them indiscriminately and excessively. At the same time, feeders can monitor the livestock's workload, the timing of rest, and the presence of diseases at any time, making it easier for them to rest when appropriate, feed them grass in a timely manner, and treat their diseases promptly. Implementing contracting to the end greatly enhances the feeders' awareness of cherishing farm implements, saving grass feed, and actively accumulating manure.

    In December of last year, when Comrade Lu Xianwen, Secretary of the CCP Xinyang Prefectural Committee, came to Yangdian Township to inspect work, he discovered, summarized, and affirmed the township's experience in raising draft cattle. The CCP Suiping County Committee then held a meeting to study and decide to promote it throughout the county. This experience quickly took root and blossomed throughout the county. By the end of February, out of the county's two hundred and twenty agricultural cooperatives, one hundred and eighty-one had adopted the "small trough feeding, combined use and maintenance" method.

    After the implementation of the self-use self-feeding livestock method, the feeders' sense of responsibility was greatly strengthened. They often brushed their mouths, swept their fur, and rubbed grass for the livestock, cherishing them like their own limbs. In Guangming First Cooperative of Shenzhai Township, livestock were weak and died severely when fed in large troughs. After being divided into small troughs, the feeders' sense of responsibility was strengthened, and the livestock feeding situation improved somewhat. Cooperative member Li Shaozhong, among the livestock he was assigned to feed, had a donkey that could not stand up. After he warmed it by building a fire, rubbed grass for it to eat, and gave it warm soup to drink, it recovered its health in more than twenty days. The phenomenon of disregarding the livestock's well-being and rushing to work to earn work points has also decreased. Last December, there were forty-nine abnormal deaths per week in the county. This March, there were only five abnormal deaths per week. Three thousand three hundred and seventy-five went from half-fat to full-fat, and nine thousand eight hundred and nine went from weak to half-fat.

    “小槽喂养，自使自喂”办法好
    申显光　晋保亭
    在目前农业社还缺乏集体管理牲畜经验的情况下，中共遂平县委在全县普遍推广了杨店乡“谁养谁使，使养合一，专人负责，保使保养”的牲畜管理经验，大大改善了耕畜饲养状况。
    遂平县杨店乡建社的时候，全乡共有牲口一千一百六十三头。其中母畜四百八十六头，有生殖能力的母畜约占三百六十头。一年来，绝大多数都增了膘，并繁殖幼畜一百八十四头，约占有繁殖能力母畜数的51％，如果再加上现已怀孕的一百三十八头母畜，共占有繁殖能力母畜数的89.4％。目前共有大小牲口一千三百零四头（另外还卖给灾区四十一头），比去春增加12％。
    牲口“大槽喂养、别人使用”和“小槽喂养、自使自喂”的两种办法，在办初级社的时候，就发生过尖锐的争论。不少社员主张用大合槽的办法，他们说大槽喂养，省劳力、少开支工分，喂的齐，不误活。结果怎样呢？魏清德领导的互助组，在1953年冬季转了初级社，全社共二十头牲口集中喂养，用了五个饲养员，每人平均喂四头。饲料本来很足，十四头牛，除每三天喂两盘磨的油浆外，每天还喂二十来斤粮食，按说是应该喂肥的。但是，因为是自己喂，别人使，别人光为自己抓分，不管牲口死活，所以越来越瘦。到1954年麦快熟的时候，大家认为不能再喂下去了。经过讨论，随即把牲口分成了小槽，又增加三个饲养员，改为自使自喂，专人负责。这样做，牲口膘很快又转好了。杨店初级社前年冬天建社以后，又把牲口合成了大槽，第三小队的二十七条牲口，只用了四个人喂。由于别人使的活过重，加之喂的不好，四个月就死去十三头。因此，去春转高级社的时候，再也没有人主张用大合槽的办法了，自觉地采用了自使自喂、专人负责的办法。
    他们根据当地牛拉车（两个牛拉一个杠的车）、犁耙地、打场，驴、马以拉磨为主，附带犁耙地、耩地、打场的使役习惯，规定了不同的饲养管理办法。首先，把牛分了类，实行了“六固定”，即：（1）固定牲口犋：每犋两头，根据公母、大小、快慢，分别编犋。（2）固定专人喂使：每犋牲口确定一人连喂带使，负责到底。（3）固定农具：对车、犁、耙、套、鞭等农具，随牲口合理搭配，包干固定使用。对包干的农具在规定期限以外损坏的，由队负责修补和增添；在规定期限以内损坏或遗失的全部由个人负责赔偿。（4）固定工分：喂一头耕牛，每天一分半，凡满八个月的牛犊与喂耕牛同样记分。使牲口时，再另外记分。（5）固定牛料：农忙的时候，每天大牛一头二斤，二等牛一头一斤半；农闲时，每天大牛一头一斤，二等牛一头十两。草以吃饱为原则。每两头牛喂一槽，每个饲养室一般喂四槽。（6）固定肥料：每犋牲口每月向社里交肥料十四车，超过的卖给社里。其次，把驴分散到各户喂养。根据各户人口多少，以数户伙喂伙用，谁喂谁得分。其三，马骡比较难喂，因而采取了由饲养技术较高的饲养员专人负责喂养，固定工分、固定草料、固定肥料的办法。各类幼畜，都随母畜走。牲畜治疗费，由社包到队，由队统一掌握使用。
    经验证明：小槽喂养，自使自喂，专人负责，包干到底的办法，有很多的好处：小槽喂养，每槽牲口少，喂的匀细，养护的好；大大减少了牲畜的疾病和死亡；自使自喂，专人负责，提高了社员的爱畜积极性，避免了别人乱拉乱用和使用过度的偏向。同时，饲养员可以随时掌握牲口劳动的轻重、倒沫的早晚和有无疾病等情况，便于让它适时休息，对它适时喂草和及时医治疾病。实行包干到底后，大大提高了饲养员爱惜农具、节约草料、积极积肥的自觉性。
    去年12月间，中共信阳地委书记路宪文同志到杨店乡检查工作时，发现、总结并肯定了这个乡饲养耕畜的经验后，中共遂平县委就召开会议研究决定，在全县范围内推广。这个经验很快就在全县生根开花。2月底，全县二百二十个农业社中，采用了“小槽喂养、使养合一”办法的就有一百八十一个。
    自使自喂牲畜的办法实施以后，大大地加强了饲养员的责任心，他们经常给牲口刷嘴、扫毛、揉草，像爱护自己的手足一样的爱护耕畜。沈寨乡光明一社，在合大槽喂养时，牲口瘦弱死亡很厉害，分成小槽喂养后，加强了饲养员的责任心，牲畜饲养状况有所好转。社员李绍中，分喂的牲口中，有一头不能站立起来的驴，经过他生火取暖，揉草喂食，温汤饮水，二十多天的时间就恢复了健康。不顾牲口死活，抢工赶活争工分的现象也减少了。去年12月全县每周非正常死亡四十九头，今年3月每周非正常死亡的只有五头，由半膘升为满膘的三千三百七十五头，由瘦弱升为半膘的九千八百零九头。
