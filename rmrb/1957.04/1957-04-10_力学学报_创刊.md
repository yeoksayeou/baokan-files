"Acta Mechanica Sinica" Launched

    The inaugural issue of "Acta Mechanica Sinica," edited by the Chinese Society of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics and published by Science Press, has been released.

    The inaugural issue includes "The Vortex Structure of Homogeneous Isotropic Turbulence During Late Decay" co-authored by Professor Zhou Peiyuan and his student Cai Shutang. They use the results of analyzing vortex sphere motion to calculate the turbulent binary velocity correlation function and point out the possibility of calculating other higher-order velocity correlation functions and other correlation functions. Also included is Professor Wu Zhonghua's "Aerodynamic Problems of Long Turbine Blades," which provides a reasonable method for designing long turbine blades. There is also "The Bending Problem of Airfoil Cylinders" by Lin Tongji, a researcher at the Institute of Mechanics, which gives the stress distribution in a cantilever beam with an airfoil cross-section.

    In addition, there are papers by Li Minhua, a researcher at the Institute of Mechanics, Hu Haichang, an associate researcher, Wang Ren, an associate professor at Peking University, He Zuoxiu, an assistant researcher at the Institute of Physics, and Luo Jinbo from the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and others.

    “力学学报”创刊
    中国力学学会编辑、科学出版社出版的“力学学报”创刊号已经出版。
    创刊号中有周培源教授和他的学生蔡树棠合写的“均匀各向同性湍流在后期衰变时的涡性结构”，他们利用分析涡球运动的结果来计算湍流二元速度关联函数，并指出计算其他高元速度关联函数和别的关联函数的可能性；吴仲华教授的“透平机械长叶片气体动力学问题”，他提供了合理地设计涡轮机长叶片的方法。还有力学研究所研究员林同骥的“翼截面柱体的弯曲问题”，它给出计算具有翼形断面的悬臂梁里的应力分布。
    此外，还有力学研究所研究员李敏华、副研究员胡海昌、北京大学副教授王仁、物理研究所助理研究员何祚庥和中共中央宣传部罗劲柏等的论文。　（力）
