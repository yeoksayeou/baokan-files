Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, April 20th: Du Zheheng, Governor of Liaoning Province, hosted a grand banquet tonight to welcome Chairman Voroshilov and the Soviet guests.

At 7:30 PM, Chairman Voroshilov and others, accompanied by Vice Chairman Zhu De, Liaoning Province Governor Du Zheheng, and Shenyang Mayor Liu Baotian, entered the hall, greeted by enthusiastic applause.

Chairman Voroshilov delivered a speech at the banquet. He said, "In the short time in Anshan and Shenyang, I visited some factories and the Northeast Industrial Exhibition Hall, and I am deeply impressed. These achievements are not only the pride of Shenyang and the Northeast, but also the pride of all the Chinese people. These factories should not merely be called factories; they should be called huge symbols of industrialization. The Chinese people are moving forward on the right path, and the Soviet people have also made some modest contributions. In the future, China can achieve even greater accomplishments and fully build its country into an industrialized nation." Finally, he raised his glass and suggested that everyone toast to the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, to the health of Chairman Mao Zedong, to the health of Vice Chairman Zhu De and Vice Premier He Long, and to the health of the Governor of Liaoning Province and all the comrades present. His speech was repeatedly interrupted by applause.

Du Zheheng spoke at the beginning of the banquet, expressing a warm welcome on behalf of the people of the entire province to the Soviet guests for visiting Liaoning Province. Chairman Voroshilov's visit to our country once again brings us the fraternal friendship of the Soviet people, which is a great encouragement to us.

After the banquet, the distinguished guests attended a song and dance evening and watched musical and dance performances.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, April 20th: Chairman Voroshilov and the accompanying Soviet guests today visited factories and the Northeast Industrial Exhibition Hall in Shenyang.

In the morning, the distinguished guests, accompanied by Vice Chairman Zhu De, Vice Premier He Long, Director of the State Technological Commission Huang Jing, Liaoning Province Governor Du Zheheng, and First Secretary of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Jiao Ruoyu, first visited the Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant.

    辽宁省省长设宴欢迎伏老
    贵宾们在沈阳参观工厂和工业陈列馆
    据新华社沈阳20日电　辽宁省省长杜者蘅今晚举行盛大宴会，欢迎伏罗希洛夫主席和苏联贵宾们。
    晚上七时三十分，伏罗希洛夫主席等由朱德副主席、辽宁省省长杜者蘅和沈阳市市长刘宝田陪同走进大厅时，大厅内响起了热烈的掌声。
    伏罗希洛夫主席在宴会上讲了话。他说，在鞍山、沈阳的短短时间内，看了一些工厂和东北工业陈列馆，给我的印象却很深。这些成就，不只是沈阳和东北的骄傲，也是全中国人民的骄傲。这些工厂不应该仅仅叫作工厂，应当叫做巨大的工业化的象征。中国人民正在朝着正确的道路前进，苏联人民也作了些微薄的帮助。中国在前进的将来完全可以取得更大的成就，完全能把自己的国家建成一个工业化的国家。最后，他举起酒杯，建议大家为中苏两国人民兄弟般的友谊，为毛泽东主席的健康，为朱德副主席和贺龙副总理的健康，为辽宁省省长和在座同志们的身体健康干杯。他的讲话不断被掌声所打断。
    杜者蘅在宴会开始时讲话，他代表全省人民表示热烈欢迎苏联贵宾们到辽宁省访问。这次伏罗希洛夫主席来我国访问，又一次给我们带来了苏联人民的兄弟友谊，这对于我们是一个很大的鼓舞。
    宴会后，贵宾们出席了歌舞晚会，观看了音乐舞蹈节目。
    据新华社沈阳20日电　伏罗希洛夫主席和同来的苏联贵宾们，今天在沈阳市参观了工厂和东北工业陈列馆。
    上午，贵宾们由朱德副主席、贺龙副总理、国家技术委员会主任黄敬、辽宁省省长杜者蘅和中共沈阳市委员会第一书记焦若愚等陪同，首先参观了沈阳第一机床厂。这个能够制造各种车床的现代化的工厂，是在苏联专家的帮助下改建成的。当贵宾们到达第一机床厂时，受到了这个厂近千名男女职工的夹道欢迎。
    伏罗希洛夫主席离开这个工厂前，向欢送他的男女职工们讲了话，他在讲话中祝中国日益富强。
