Goethe was strolling in the park in Weimar. On a path narrow enough for only one person to pass, he encountered a critic who had viciously attacked his works. As they met face to face, the critic arrogantly said, "I never make way for scoundrels..."

"But I do..." Goethe replied with a smile, stepping aside.

    歌德和批评家
    歌德在魏玛的公园里漫步。在一条只能单身通过的小路上，遇到了一个曾恶毒地抨击过他作品的批评家。当他俩对面碰上时，批评家傲慢地说：“我从来不给浑蛋让路……”
    “而我却相反……”歌德说完，便面带微笑，退到一旁去了。
