Comprehensive report from our newspaper: Xinhua News Agency reported that the Parisian newspaper "L'Humanité" published a piece on April 17th, pointing out that France and Israel are planning to launch an armed attack on Egypt again. The weekly magazine "L'Observateur Français" confirmed this news on the 18th. On the same day, the "Le Peuple de Paris", the organ of the ruling Socialist Party, denied this news. The French Ministry of Defense even filed a lawsuit against "L'Humanité" for this reason.

"L'Humanité" revealed that under the secret alliance between France and Israel, confidants of the French Minister of Defense, Bourgès-Maunoury, drafted a "Operation Jaguar" plan. It is said that this plan stipulates the following steps: 1. Israeli ships, accompanied by French ships, would enter the Suez Canal without prior notice, in order to provoke a fierce reaction from the Egyptian authorities; 2. Afterwards, Paris and Tel Aviv would issue statements regarding the occurrence of aggression. Israeli troops would then be ordered to cross the border and invade Egyptian territory; 3. French air force units, pre-concentrated in Israel, would provide aerial cover for the land invasion.

It is said that Bourgès-Maunoury has already notified the U.S. Chargé d'Affaires in Paris about this plan, asking the U.S. side not to create any obstacles to the implementation of the "Operation Jaguar" plan. It is said that the minister received an affirmative reply.

"L'Observateur Français" wrote:
　　"The General Staff is constantly considering such (an opportunity to invade Egypt) and is drawing up plans. It maintains constant contact with the office of Israeli Army Chief of Staff General Dayan, and combat weapons are continuing to gather in Israeli territory."

A spokesman for the Swedish battalion of the United Nations Emergency Force said on the 20th that Israeli troops opened fire on the Swedish troops of the United Nations Emergency Force in the northeastern demilitarized zone of Gaza on the evening of the 18th.

The Swedish troops immediately returned fire. The two sides exchanged fire for about ten minutes, after which the Israeli troops retreated to their borders.

According to a UN press release issued on the 18th, General Burns, commander of the UN Emergency Force, requested the Israeli authorities on the 17th to return the livestock that Israeli soldiers had recently looted from Arabs in the Gaza Strip on two occasions.

Burns had also lodged three other protests with Israel. These protests involved fourteen incidents of hostile action.

TASS, Tel Aviv reported: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Israel published an open letter to the Israeli people in the "People's Voice" newspaper, calling on the masses to strengthen their opposition to the Israeli ruling clique's plot to instigate new military adventures, this group openly threatens to restore the war against Egypt together with French colonialists, and clamors to take military action against Jordan.

The open letter pointed out that ensuring Israel's national interests cannot be achieved by colluding with imperialism against the Arab people, but must be achieved by forming an alliance with the Arab people.

    “人道报”和“法兰西观察家”揭露
    法以阴谋重侵埃及
    以色列军竟向联合国部队开火
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：巴黎“人道报”4月17日刊载了一条消息，指出法国和以色列正在计划重新对埃及发动武装进攻。18日的“法兰西观察家”周刊证实了这个消息。同日，执政的社会党机关报“巴黎人民报”则否认这一消息。法国国防部并为此对“人道报”提出控告。
    “人道报”透露，在法国和以色列结成秘密联盟的情况下，法国国防部长布歇—莫努里的亲信草拟了一个“美洲豹战役”计划。据说这个计划规定下列步骤：一、以色列船只在法国船只的伴随下不预先通知就开进苏伊士运河，以便挑起埃及当局的激烈反应；二、之后，巴黎和特拉维夫会发表关于发生侵略的声明。以色列军队就将奉命越过国界，侵入埃及领土；三、事先集中在以色列的法国空军部队将从空中掩护陆路的侵略。
    据说布歇—莫努里已经把这个计划通知美国驻巴黎代办。要美国方面对实现“美洲豹战役”计划不要作任何阻碍。据说这位部长得到了肯定的答复。
    “法兰西观察家”周刊写道：
    “总司令部经常在考虑这种（侵略埃及的）机会，并且在制定计划。它同以色列陆军总参谋长达扬将军的机关保持着经常的接触，战斗武器正在继续向以色列领土集结。”
    联合国紧急部队瑞典营的发言人20日说，以色列军队18日晚上向加沙东北停战线一带的联合国紧急部队的瑞典军队开火。
    瑞典军队立即回击。双方互相射击了约十分钟，后来，以色列军队退回了他们的国境。
    据18日发表的联合国新闻公报说，联合国紧急部队司令伯恩斯将军17日要求以色列当局把以色列士兵最近两次在加沙地带从阿拉伯人那里劫掠的牲口归还。
    伯恩斯还曾经向以色列提出了另外三次抗议。这些抗议牵涉十四起敌对行动事件。
    据塔斯社特拉维夫消息：以色列共产党中央委员会在“人民呼声报”上发表了告以色列人民书，号召人民群众加强反对以色列统治集团图谋策动的新军事冒险，这个集团公然威胁要同法国殖民主义者一道恢复对埃及的战争，并且扬言要对约旦采取军事行动。
    告人民书指出，要保障以色列的民族利益是不能同帝国主义勾结来反对阿拉伯人民的，而必须同阿拉伯人民结成联盟。
