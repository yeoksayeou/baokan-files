Recently, the Shanghai State-owned Nanjing Road Fashion Store displayed seventy attractive and novel women's spring outfits – reversible overcoats and woolen vests, selling for about half the price of clothes made of the same quality materials. These are the first batch of economy clothes designed and pieced together by the store's technicians using scrap materials. Among these spring outfits are novel overcoats made from twenty-eight pieces of scrap material, as well as various vests with generous color combinations. Thanks to skillful tailoring, the appearance is no different from those made from whole pieces of material. Reversible overcoats originally priced at more than 30 yuan now sell for only about 20 yuan, and colorful woolen vests are also about 10 yuan cheaper.

    利用碎料巧制春装
    最近，上海市国营南京路时装商店出现七十件美观新颖的女式春装——两用大衣和呢马夹，售价比一般质料相同的衣服要便宜一半左右。这是该店技工利用碎料设计拼制而成的第一批节约服装。在这批春装里有用二十八块碎料制成的新颖大衣；还有各种拼色大方的马夹。由于裁制技术巧妙，外形和整料裁制的没有两样。原价要三十多元的两用大衣现在只售二十元左右，各色呢马夹也要便宜十元左右。
