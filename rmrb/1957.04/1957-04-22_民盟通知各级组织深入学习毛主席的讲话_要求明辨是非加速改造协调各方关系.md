The Central Propaganda and Study Committee of the China Democratic League issued a joint notice on April 20, calling on local League organizations to actively promote League members to deeply study Chairman Mao's speech on the correct handling of contradictions among the people.

The notice pointed out: Chairman Mao's recent speech on the correct handling of contradictions among the people put forward extremely important guidelines for adjusting the relationship of contradictions among the people, which is a major development of Marxism-Leninism in China under new historical conditions. The notice also stated that during the League's National Work Conference, it had conducted in-depth study and discussion of Chairman Mao's speeches at the Supreme State Conference and the National Propaganda Work Conference, and used the spirit of Chairman Mao's speeches as the overall guiding ideology for the conference resolutions.

The notice concluded: During the study and discussion, the following is required:
(1) Clarify the changes in domestic class relations, the nature of contradictions among the people, and the methods for resolving them, thereby clarifying the important significance of implementing "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" in the current new situation. (2) Clarify that ideological issues among the people should be resolved through discussion, criticism, persuasion, and education, thereby correctly understanding the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." League members should give play to the spirit of independent thinking within their respective units, open up their minds, engage in free debate, distinguish right from wrong, uphold the truth, and correct mistakes. It is expected that these discussions will gradually improve political and ideological levels and further promote the enthusiasm and creativity of intellectuals in building a socialist society. (3) Deeply understand Chairman Mao's instruction that educators must first be educated, strive to study Marxism-Leninism, and frequently use the Marxist-Leninist worldview as a guide for examining their own actions in practice; and should humbly learn from workers and peasants, and strive to have more opportunities to directly contact workers and peasants to accelerate self-transformation. (4) Clarify that the League, as a political organization, must assist the Party in coordinating relationships in all aspects, uniting all forces that can be united to build socialism. At the same time, it must also follow the methods instructed by Chairman Mao, starting from the desire for unity, going through criticism and struggle, and then achieving better unity on a new basis.

    民盟通知各级组织深入学习毛主席的讲话
    要求明辨是非加速改造协调各方关系
    本报讯　中国民主同盟中央宣传、学习委员会于4月20日发出联合通知，号召各地盟的组织积极推动盟员深入学习毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的讲话。
    通知指出：毛主席最近关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的讲话，提出了调整人民内部矛盾关系的极为重要的方针，这是马克思列宁主义理论在中国新的历史条件下的重大发展。通知并说明盟的全国工作会议时，曾对毛主席在最高国务会议和在全国宣传工作会议上的讲话，进行了深入的学习和讨论，并以毛主席讲话的精神作为会议决议的总的指导思想。
    通知最后说：在学习讨论时，要求：
  （一）明确国内阶级关系的变化，人民内部矛盾的性质及其解决的办法，从而明确在目前新形势下贯彻“长期共存、互相监督”的重要意义。（二）明确对于人民内部的思想问题，应该用讨论、批评、说服、教育的方法来解决，从而正确地领会“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针。盟员应在各单位内发挥独立思考的精神，敞开思想，自由辩论，明辨是非，坚持真理，修正错误。以期在这些讨论中逐步提高政治思想水平，进一步发挥知识分子在建设社会主义社会中的积极性和创造性。（三）深刻体会毛主席说的教育者须先受教育的指示，努力学习马克思列宁主义，并经常在实践中用马克思列宁主义的世界观来作为检查自己行动的指针；并应虚心向工农学习，争取有更多的机会直接和工农接触以加速自我改造。（四）明确盟作为一政治团体，必须协助党协调各方面的关系，团结一切可以团结的力量来建设社会主义。同时也必须遵循毛主席所指示的办法，从团结的愿望出发，经过批评和斗争，然后又在新的基础上取得更好的团结。
