Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 12th: Guangdong Province's public security organs have completed interrogation of Huang Lixing, an American-Chiang Kai-shek armed agent airdropped into the Shiwan Mountain area. Huang Lixing was the only one of the five airdropped agents sent from Taiwan to survive; the others were killed by us.

This group of armed agents, airdropped at 00:15 on October 19th of last year in the Shiwan Mountain area on the border of Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, was dispatched by the "National Security Bureau Intelligence Bureau" of the Chiang Kai-shek group's intelligence agency in Taiwan. According to the confession of the captured agent Huang Lixing and all the seized evidence, their airdrop activity was carried out under the direct instructions of American imperialist intelligence agents. Huang Lixing said that after joining the intelligence organization, he was trained by American agent Weathers and other intelligence instructors at the "Guanyin Mountain Guerrilla Cadre Training Class" in Taiwan. On the evening of October 18th of last year, an American agent ordered them to prepare for takeoff, and also sent him and the other four agents, Feng Zhilin, Deng Shuyin, Chen Shuzhen, and Zhang Jinfu, to the airport in a jeep. The interpreter conveyed the American agent's airdrop mission to them. Their mission was to: parachute into the Shiwan Mountain area on the border of Guangdong and Guangxi provinces to develop special agent armed forces, establish radio stations, gather intelligence, and carry out armed harassment and sabotage activities.

The agents took off from Hsinchu Airport in Taiwan that evening, and parachuted into the mountains of Fangcheng County, Guangdong Province at 00:15 on the 19th. That evening, the brothers Weng Dingjin, farmers in Fangcheng County, discovered this and immediately ran to the township People's Committee eight miles away to report it. Within a few hours of the agents landing, they were surrounded by local militiamen, public security personnel, and a unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

When the local garrison and public security organs annihilated this group of agents, they seized American-made radios, American-made carbines, revolvers, hand grenades, parachutes and parachuting supplies, as well as the notebooks of the agents who received special agent training in Taiwan, and other materials and ammunition.

    人民的土地上不容特务立足
    美蒋空投特务一起在十万大山就歼
    新华社广州12日电　广东省公安机关最近对捕获的空投在十万大山中的美蒋武装特务黄理兴侦讯完毕。黄理兴是这次从台湾派遣来的五名空投特务中唯一留住性命的一个，其他都已被我打死。
    这一组在去年10月19日零时十五分空投在广东、广西两省交界处十万大山中的武装特务，是由台湾蒋介石集团特务机关“国家安全局情报局”派遣的。根据落网的特务分子黄理兴供认的材料以及缴获的全部罪证证实，他们的空投活动是在美帝国主义特务分子的直接指使下进行的。黄理兴说，他参加特务组织后，曾在台湾“观音山游击干部训练班”受美国特务韦德斯以及其他特务教官的训练。去年10月18日晚，一名美国特务命令他们准备起飞，还用吉普车把他和另外四名特务冯志林、邓术殷、陈树桢、张金甫一起送到飞机场，由翻译人员向他们传达了美国特务布置的空投任务，他们的任务是：空降到广东、广西两省交界的十万大山中发展特务武装，建立电台，刺探情报以及进行武装骚扰、爆破等活动。
    特务们当晚从台湾新竹机场起飞，19日零时十五分空降在广东省防城县的丛山中。当晚防城县农民翁定锦兄弟俩发觉后，立即跑到八里外的乡人民委员会去报告。在特务们降落后的几小时内，便被当地民兵、公安人员和中国人民解放军某部包围了。
    当地驻军和公安机关在歼灭这组特务时，缴获了美制电台、美制卡宾枪、左轮枪、手榴弹、降落伞和跳伞用品，还有特务分子在台湾接受特务训练的笔记本以及其他物资、弹药一部。
