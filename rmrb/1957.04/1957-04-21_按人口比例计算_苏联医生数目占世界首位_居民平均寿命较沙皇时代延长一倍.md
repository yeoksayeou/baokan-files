Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th - The average life expectancy of Soviet residents has extended from 32 years in the pre-revolutionary Tsarist era to 64 years, a full doubling. There are currently about 30,000 centenarians in the Soviet Union. The mortality rate is also decreasing year by year. In 1955, the average death rate was 8.2 per thousand residents, which dropped to 7.7 in 1956. These are all results of the happy life in the Soviet Union, especially the development of health care.

The number of doctors in the Soviet Union now ranks first in the world in terms of population ratio. In 1956, there were approximately 350,000 doctors in the Soviet Union, an average of 17 doctors per 10,000 people. Before the revolution, in 1913, Russia only had 28,000 doctors, only 1.7 doctors per 10,000 people. The Soviet Union now has 25,000 hospitals with 1,354,000 beds. In some previously backward republics, the number of doctors has increased even faster. Comparing 1956 with 1913 before the revolution, the number of doctors in Kyrgyzstan increased by 147 times, Tajikistan by 129 times, and Uzbekistan by 64 times.

The Soviet Union implements a national free medical care system. From the simplest eye drops to the most complex heart surgery and brain surgery, everything is free. All medical and food expenses for patients hospitalized for treatment are completely waived. If a patient recuperates at home, the doctor visits the home for treatment on time, and the cost of the medicines used is very low at the state price. Air medical teams performing emergency rescue missions are spread throughout the country. These air medical teams are equipped with various types of airplanes and helicopters. If residents in the city suffer from a sudden illness, they only need to make a phone call, and the ambulance will arrive within ten minutes. The ambulances are equipped with radios, and the dispatcher in the emergency station can notify the on-duty vehicle to go to the required location at any time.

The Soviet Union pays special attention to disease prevention and the recuperation of working people. More than ten million people undergo physical examinations every year specifically for cancer prevention. Every year, millions of workers and numerous collective farm members recuperate in sanatoriums. Within the trade union system, there are 120 scenic travel bases. Four new travel bases will also be built this year. A total of 70 will be added within three years. Most travelers who go to these travel bases do not pay for travel expenses or pay very little.

In addition, the Soviet Union also attaches great importance to the training of talents and medical research. There are now 68 higher medical specialty schools in the Soviet Union. There are 27,000 people engaged in medical scientific research work in various places.

    按人口比例计算
    苏联医生数目占世界首位
    居民平均寿命较沙皇时代延长一倍
    新华社莫斯科20日电　苏联现在居民的平均寿命由革命前沙皇时代的三十二岁延长到六十四岁，整整延长一倍。现在苏联约有三万个百岁以上的老人。死亡率也年年降低。1955年平均每千居民中死亡八点二人，1956年下降到七点七人。这些都是苏联幸福生活，特别是保健事业发展的结果。
    苏联现在的医生数目，按人口比例来说占世界第一位。1956年，苏联共约有三十五万名医生，平均每一万人中就有十七名医生。而革命前1913年俄国仅有二万八千名医生，每一万人中只有一点七名医生。苏联现在有二万五千所医院，有一百三十五万四千个病床。在一些以前较落后的共和国，医生的数目增加得更快。如以1956年同革命前1913年比较，吉尔吉斯的医生数目增加了一百四十七倍，塔吉克增加了一百二十九倍，乌兹别克增多了六十四倍。
    苏联实行全民公费医疗制度，从最简单的滴眼药水到最复杂的心脏手术和大脑开刀，都是免费的。病人住院治疗的医药和膳食费都全部免除。病人如果在家里疗养，医生按时到家里治疗，所用的药物的费用按国家的价格是很少的。执行急病救护任务的航空医疗队遍及全国。这些航空医疗队配备有各式的飞机和直升飞机。城市的居民如果患了急病，只要拨一次电话，十来分钟内急救车就来了。急救车上都装了无线电，急救站里的调度员可以随时通知出勤的汽车立刻到需要的地方去。
    苏联特别注意疾病的预防工作和劳动人民的休养。专门为了预防癌症每年就有一千多万人去进行身体检查。每年有数百万职工以及众多的集体农庄庄员在疗养地休养。在工会系统内，有一百二十个风景优美的旅行基地。今年还将新建四个旅行基地。在三年内将总共增加七十个。到这些旅行基地去的大部分旅行者都不交纳路费或者交得很少。
    此外，苏联对培养人才和医务研究工作也很重视。现在苏联共有六十八所高等医药专科学校。各地从事医药科学研究工作的人有二万七千人。
