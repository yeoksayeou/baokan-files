British "The Scotsman" Reveals
    US Instigates Iraq and Turkey to Make Trouble in Jordan

    (Dispatch from this newspaper) According to a report in the April 18th edition of "The Scotsman", the United States is directing pro-American and British countries such as Iraq and Turkey to support pro-imperialist forces in Jordan.

    "The Scotsman"'s dispatch from Washington stated: "The United States is uneasily aware" that the "effort to move Jordan away from its neutral policy may still fail, and therefore it is trying to avoid this outcome and help the pro-Western elements in the country without making them liable to be accused of betraying Arab nationalism."

    "The Scotsman" said, "The US State Department would prefer to see Saudi Arabia and Iraq help King Hussein. These two countries have been told that they will receive all US support in this effort. In addition, King Hussein has been made aware that if his new moderate, non-anti-Western government consolidates its position, he can expect financial assistance and military equipment under the Eisenhower Doctrine."

    "The Scotsman" said that experts at the US State Department believe that it is necessary to make Jordanian nationalists "less convinced that they will receive support from Syria and Egypt." Therefore, "Turkey will, on the advice of the United States," take action to put pressure on Syria. The newspaper said, "Washington will not be surprised if in the coming days Syria accuses Turkey of taking military action on its border." The newspaper said that Washington "hopes," also in order to deal with Syria, "that Iraq will take action in the coming days."

    英国“苏格兰人报”揭露
    美国唆使伊拉克和土耳其在约旦捣乱
    本报讯　据4月18日的“苏格兰人报”报道，美国正在指使伊拉克、土耳其等亲美、英的国家支持约旦的亲帝国主义势力。
    “苏格兰人报”这篇从华盛顿发来的电讯说：“美国不安地认识到”，使约旦离开中立政策的道路的“努力可能仍旧失败，因此它正在设法避免这种结局和帮助这个国家的亲西方分子，而又不使他们有可能被指责为出卖阿拉伯民族主义”。
    “苏格兰人报”说，“美国国务院宁愿看到沙特阿拉伯和伊拉克来帮助侯赛因国王。这两个国家已经被告诉说，它们在这种努力中将得到美国的一切支持。此外还已经使侯赛因国王了解，如果他的新的温和的、不反对西方的政府巩固它的地位的话，他可以希望根据艾森豪威尔主义得到财政援助和军事装备。”
    “苏格兰人报”说，美国国务院的专家们相信，必须使约旦的民族主义者“不太相信会从叙利亚和埃及得到支持”，因此，“土耳其将根据美国的建议”采取行动，对叙利亚施加压力。报纸说，“如果在今后的几天中叙利亚控诉说土耳其在它的边境上采取军事行动，华盛顿将不会感到惊讶。”报纸说，华盛顿方面“希望”，也是为了对付叙利亚，“伊拉克将在今后几天内采取行动”。
