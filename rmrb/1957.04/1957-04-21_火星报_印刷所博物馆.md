    "Iskra" Printing House Museum
    Near Leipzig in the German Democratic Republic, there is a quiet street called Russenstrasse. Beside the street is a small garden. In front of house number 48 stands a marble monument with a bas-relief of Lenin, surrounded by flowers. The first issue of "Iskra," founded by Lenin 57 years ago, was printed here.
    On January 29, 1900, after his term of exile ended, Lenin worked intensely to establish a secret, all-Russian political newspaper. Lenin considered this a fundamental link in establishing a Marxist revolutionary workers' party. Due to police persecution, it was impossible to publish such a newspaper inside Russia. Therefore, Lenin decided to publish it abroad, naming it "Iskra" (The Spark). Its editorial office was in Munich, and the printing press was in Leipzig. This printing press was only discovered two and a half years ago with the help of workers who had printed "Iskra."
    At the end of the last century, this was a small printing press for a local newspaper. The owner of the printing press, Hermann Rau, as Lenin described, was a reliable social democrat. Through Leipzig workers who printed Russian books, a set of movable type was obtained. Thus, at the end of December 1900, the first issue of "Iskra" was published on Russenstrasse.
    The printing press has been arranged as a museum, but it was too small, so last year a house was built next to the small building and made a separate exhibition hall. Visitors can learn about the Russian proletariat's revolutionary struggle during those years. On display are photographs of Lenin's family, as well as a map of Lenin's route from the village of Shushenskoye in Siberia to Leipzig. Visitors can see portraits of active agents of "Iskra" in St. Petersburg, Moscow, Baku, Samara, Kharkov, Odessa, Kiev, and other places in the museum. Lenin attached great importance to the work of "Iskra" agents, often guiding their activities and regarding them as loyal fighters for the people's interests.
    The museum displays replicas of the four issues of "Iskra" published from December 1900 to May 1901, alongside portraits of the printer Hermann Rau and the typesetter, Russian revolutionary exile Joseph Blumenfeld.
    Another exhibition hall is the printing press itself, where Lenin came to guide the publication of the first issue of "Iskra." Lenin meticulously proofread each issue of the newspaper, personally wrote many articles, specified essay topics, selected authors, corresponded extensively with correspondents, raised funds, and devised ways to secretly transport the newspaper to Russia. Under such difficult and clandestine publishing conditions, Lenin still managed to publish "Iskra" on time.
    This museum is one of the newly established museums in the German Democratic Republic because "Iskra" played a significant role in laying the organizational foundation of the Bolshevik Party and in training party cadres in the struggle against the Mensheviks, and Lenin was the organizer, ideological inspirer, and direct leader of "Iskra." Therefore, although it has been open for less than a year, nearly 10,000 people have visited it. (CNS) (with photo)

### “火星报”印刷所博物馆

    “火星报”印刷所博物馆
    在德意志民主共和国来比锡的近郊有一条寂静的鲁辛什特拉斯街。街道旁边有一个不大的花园。在四十八号住宅前面耸立着有列宁浮雕像的大理石纪念碑，纪念碑的周围满是种的鲜花。列宁在五十七年以前创办的“火星报”第一期就是在这里印刷的。
    1900年1月29日，列宁流放期满以后就为创办秘密的全俄政治报而紧张地工作。列宁认为这是建立马克思主义革命工人党的基本环节。由于警察的迫害，在俄国境内出版这样的报纸已不可能，因此，列宁就决定在国外出版，定名为
  “火星报”。它的编辑部设在慕尼黑，印刷所则设在来比锡。这个印刷所是在两年半以前才由曾印过“火星报”的工人帮助才发现的。
    在上一个世纪末这里曾经是一家地方报纸的小印刷所。印刷所的主人海尔曼·拉乌，像列宁所介绍过的，是一位可靠的社会民主党人。通过印刷俄文书籍的来比锡工人，得到一套活字。于是在1900年12月底第一期“火星报”就在鲁辛什特拉斯街出版了。
    把这个印刷所布置成为一个博物馆，规模还太小，所以去年在这个小房子旁边又修建了一所房子，把它作为一个单独的展览厅。参观的人可以在这里了解在那些年中俄国无产阶级革命斗争的情况。展览台上悬挂着列宁的家庭的照片，还有列宁从西伯利亚舒申斯克村到来比锡的路线图等。参观者可以在博物馆里看到“火星报”在彼得堡、莫斯科、巴库、萨马拉、哈尔科夫、敖德萨、基辅等地积极代办员的肖像。当年列宁非常重视“火星报”代办员的工作，经常指导他们的活动，把他们看成为为人民利益而英勇斗争的忠实战士。
    博物馆陈列着从1900年12月到1901年5月出版的四期“火星报”的复制品，旁边是印刷人海尔曼·拉乌和排字工、俄国革命流亡者约瑟夫·布留缅菲尔德的肖像。
    另一个展览厅就是印刷所，当年列宁曾到这里来指导第一期“火星报”出版工作。列宁细心地校阅每一期报纸，亲自写许多文章，规定论文题目，物色作者，同通讯员大量通信，筹集经费并设法把报纸秘密运到俄国去。在当时那种困难和秘密出版的情况下，列宁还做到了使“火星报”按时出版。
    这个博物馆是德意志民主共和国新辟的博物馆之一，因为“火星报”同孟什维克的斗争中，在奠定布尔什维克党的组织基础以及培养党的干部方面都起很大的作用，而列宁则是“火星报”的组织者、思想上的鼓舞者和直接领导者，所以，开馆以来虽然还不到一年功夫，到馆参观的已近一万人了。　　　　（社）（附图片）
    “火星报”第一期，社论“我们运动的迫切任务”是列宁写的。
