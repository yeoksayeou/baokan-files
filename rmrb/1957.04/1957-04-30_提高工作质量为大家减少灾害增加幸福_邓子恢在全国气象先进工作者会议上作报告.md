    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Deng Zihui, Director of the Rural Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Premier of the State Council, delivered a report on the 27th at the National Conference of Advanced Meteorological Workers.

    Deng Zihui first extended warm congratulations on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council to the glorious achievements of all advanced meteorological workers attending and not attending the conference.

    He said: Meteorology is closely related to all activities of human life and production. Human beings' clothing, food, housing, and transportation are all affected by meteorological changes. National defense construction, industrial construction, transportation, agriculture, forestry, water conservancy construction, fisheries, salt industry production, and grain allocation all require the cooperation of meteorological work. The work of meteorological workers is to reduce disasters and increase happiness for everyone. It can be seen how glorious and great the mission of meteorological workers is.

    Deng Zihui said that meteorological science is an emerging science, especially young in our country. Although it has been eighty-four years since the first modern observatory was established by the Catholic Church in Xujiahui, Shanghai, in 1873, strictly speaking, only after liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, with the support of the People's Liberation Army, and with the help of Soviet experts, and through the efforts of all meteorological workers, has China's meteorological cause been truly established. Now, the number of meteorological observatories and stations in our country has increased from 72 before liberation to 1,377. The meteorological data accumulated by meteorological workers in our country has played a significant role in national construction; the accurate forecasts of meteorological workers during the landing of a strong typhoon last year and the great flood in the Yangtze River in 1954 reduced considerable losses for the people.

    Deng Zihui pointed out in his report that meteorological work should pay special attention to improving quality in the future. Because, after several years of efforts, our country's meteorological observatory and station network has been initially formed. Primary technical personnel have also been able to generally meet objective needs, and technical specifications and instrument standards have been basically unified. Under such circumstances, if the focus of construction is not gradually shifted to improving quality, it will be difficult to improve meteorological work further. In order to improve quality, we should study business, summarize experience, and conduct scientific research. The urgent task at present is to rapidly improve the level of business management and establish a technical guidance system; otherwise, quality cannot be fully improved. When talking about the issue of studying business, Deng Zihui especially emphasized that meteorological workers should work with peace of mind and regard meteorological work as their lifelong career. He criticized the erroneous views that meteorological work is simple and tedious and has no future, and asked meteorological workers to measure their work from the overall interests of the people.

    He said that the service objects of meteorological work are diverse and cannot be overlooked; however, the scope of service is large and the number is large, and nothing is greater than agriculture. Since ancient times, farmers in our country have attached importance to the role of meteorology. The twenty-four solar terms are important contributions of Chinese farmers and intellectuals in climatology. Farmers have figured out many laws of meteorological and climatic changes from their own life and production experience, and they rely on these experiences to fight against nature. However, due to the various oppressions suffered by farmers in the past, they fell into poverty and bankruptcy, and due to the individual production of farmers, they were weak and unable to carry out large-scale struggles against nature, so they had to rely on the heavens for food. Now, the various oppressions on farmers have been lifted, and agricultural cooperation has been basically completed. The larger the scale of agricultural collective production, the more the need for the supply of meteorological information; the more developed agricultural technology, the more important the meteorological guarantee. To strive for a sustained and bumper harvest in agriculture, the cooperation of agricultural meteorological work is required. Therefore, serving agriculture is an extremely important task for meteorological workers.

    When mentioning the future construction policy of meteorological observatories and stations in our country, Deng Zihui said that the distribution density of meteorological observatories and stations in the eastern region of our country has basically met the requirements. The task of these regions in the future is how to make these stations distributed more reasonably, more scientifically, more economically, and more able to improve work efficiency. Meteorological stations in the western region of our country are still very sparse, with large areas of blank areas, and the technical force is also very weak. However, these areas are the outposts for disastrous weather to invade our country, and in the future, stations should be built mainly in these areas, and their technical force should be strengthened as much as possible. This area is almost entirely a minority nationality area. Whether the construction work of stations in these areas can be completed depends on the cultivation of minority nationality cadres. It should be clear that the meteorological work in the minority nationality areas should basically be done by the minority nationality cadres themselves, with the assistance of Han cadres.

    Deng Zihui asked the meteorological departments to launch a campaign to increase production and practice economy. He said that the production increase target of meteorological workers is to try every possible way to come up with various correct information and data to meet the growing needs of all parties. Everyone should pay attention to economy and start from all aspects. Particular attention should be paid to major aspects, such as business plans and important measures.

    Finally, Deng Zihui hoped that while studying business, meteorological workers will strive to study Marxism-Leninism, especially Chairman Mao's instructions on correctly handling contradictions among the people at the Supreme State Council, to improve their political level and ideological understanding, and to do a good job in cadre unity.

### 提高工作质量为大家减少灾害增加幸福  邓子恢在全国气象先进工作者会议上作报告

    提高工作质量为大家减少灾害增加幸福
    邓子恢在全国气象先进工作者会议上作报告
    新华社讯　中共中央农村工作部部长、国务院副总理邓子恢27日在全国气象先进工作者会议上作了报告。
    邓子恢首先代表中共中央和国务院向大会表示热烈的贺意，祝贺出席这次会议的和没有出席这次会议的全体气象先进工作者的光荣成就。
    他说：气象是与人类的生活、生产的一切活动息息相关的，人类的衣、食、住、行无不受到气象变化的影响。国防建设、工业建设、交通运输、农业林业、水利建设、渔业盐业生产、粮食调运等，都需要气象工作的配合。气象工作者的工作是为大家减少灾害、增加幸福。由此可见，气象工作者的使命是何等光荣而伟大。
    邓子恢说，气象科学是一门新兴的科学，在我国尤其年青。虽然自1873年天主教会在上海徐家汇建立了第一个近代化的观象台以来，已有八十四年的历史，但严格地说来，只有在解放以后，在共产党和人民政府的领导下，在人民解放军的支持下，在苏联专家的帮助下，经过全体气象工作者的努力，我国的气象事业才真正地建立起来。现在我国的气象台、站，已经从解放前的七十二个发展到一千三百七十七个。我国气象工作者所积累下来的气象资料，已经对国家建设起了重大的作用；去年一次强大台风的登陆以及1954年长江大水时，气象工作者的准确预报，使人民减少了不少损失。
    邓子恢在报告中指出，今后气象工作，应该特别注意提高质量。因为，经过几年来的努力，我国气象台、站网已经初步形成。初级技术人材也已经能够大体满足客观的需要，技术规范、仪器标准已经基本上得到统一。在这种情况下，假如不把建设重点逐步转到提高质量方面去，就很难使气象工作提高一步。为了提高质量，应该钻研业务，总结经验，进行科学研究工作。当前的迫切任务是迅速提高业务管理水平，建立技术指导系统，否则质量就不能全面提高。在谈到钻研业务问题的时候，邓子恢特别强调气象工作者要安心工作，把气象工作作为自己的终身职业。他批判了那种认为气象工作简单枯燥，没有前途等错误看法，要求气象工作者从人民群众的整体利益来衡量自己的工作。
    他说，气象工作的服务对象是多方面的，不能顾此失彼；但服务范围之大，数量之多，莫过于农业。我国农民自古以来就重视气象作用，农时二十四个节气，是我国农民和知识分子在气候学上的重要贡献。农民从自己生活和生产经验中，摸出了不少气象、气候变化的规律，他们凭借这些经验来向自然界作斗争。但是由于过去农民遭受种种压迫而陷于贫困破产，由于农民的个体生产而软弱无力，他们不可能向自然界进行大规模的斗争，只好靠天吃饭。现在农民身上的种种压迫解除了，农业合作化已基本上完成了，农业集体生产的规模愈大，就愈加需要气象情报资料的供应；农业技术愈发达，气象保证也就愈重要。要争取农业持久的大丰收，就要有农业气象工作的配合。所以，为农业服务是气象工作者的一个极为重要的任务。
    在提到今后我国气象台、站建设方针的时候，邓子恢说，我国东部地区，气象台、站分布密度已基本达到要求，这些地区今后的任务是如何使这些台、站分布得更合理，更科学，更节约，更能提高工作效率。我国西部地区台、站还非常稀少，有大块的空白区，技术力量也很弱，但是这些地区却是灾害性天气入侵我国的前哨，今后主要要在这些地区建站，要尽力增强他们的技术力量。这一带几乎全部是少数民族地区，这些地区建站工作能否完成，关键在于少数民族干部的培养。应该明确，少数民族地区的气象工作，基本上应该培养少数民族干部自己来做，汉族干部加以协助。
    邓子恢要求气象部门展开增产节约运动。他说，气象工作者的增产目标，就是要想尽一切办法，拿出各种正确的情报与资料来满足各方面日益增长的需要。节约要每个同志注意，从各个方面着手。尤其要注意大的方面，如业务计划与重要的措施等。
    最后，邓子恢希望气象工作者在钻研业务的同时，努力学习马克思列宁主义，特别要学习毛主席在最高国务会议上关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的指示，来提高自己的政治水平和思想认识，搞好干部团结。
