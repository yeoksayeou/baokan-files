    Love Collective Labor, Cherish Collective Property
    Rural Party Organizations Should Strengthen Political Education
    --From the "Workers' Affairs" Newspaper Editorial--
    The Bulgarian "Workers' Affairs" newspaper published an editorial on the 26th, pointing out that 80% of Bulgaria's working farmers have now become members of agricultural cooperatives. The huge task facing rural Party organizations at all levels is to improve the political and ideological education work of the cooperatives.
    The editorial believes that in carrying out political and ideological education in cooperatives, it is necessary to struggle against the remnants of capitalist ideology, cultivate the correct attitude of cooperative members towards collective labor, and make all members care for and cherish collective property as if it were their own.
    The editorial said that the regular tasks of rural Party organizations at all levels are: to use various forms such as radio, tabloids, and meetings to expose bad behaviors that do not conform to the moral standards of the new society, commend good behaviors and traditions, publicize the examples of advanced cooperative members and the great achievements of the cooperatives, and point out the development prospects of the cooperatives. The personal examples of Communist Party members, members of the Farmers' Union, and cooperative leaders have a great educational effect on cooperative members. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    热爱集体劳动　珍惜集体财产
    农村党组织应加强政治教育
    ——保“工人事业报”社论——
    保加利亚“工人事业报”26日发表的社论指出，现在，保加利亚劳动农民的80％都已经成为农业合作社社员，农村各级党组织面临的巨大任务是改进合作社的政治思想教育工作。
    社论认为，在合作社中进行政治思想教育时，应当同资本主义的思想残余进行斗争，培养社员对待集体劳动的正确态度，使所有的社员都像对待自己的财产一样关心和珍惜集体财产。
    社论说，农村各级党组织的经常任务是：利用广播、小报、会议等各种形式揭露不符合新社会道德标准的不良行为，表扬好的行为和传统，宣传先进社员的范例和合作社取得的巨大成就，指出合作社的发展远景。共产党员、农民联盟盟员、合作社领导人等的个人榜样对社员有很大的教育作用。　（据新华社讯）
