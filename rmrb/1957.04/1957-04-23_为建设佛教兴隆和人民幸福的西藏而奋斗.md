    Strive to Build a Prosperous Buddhist and Happy People's Tibet
    Banchen Erdini
    The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region has been established for a full year today. Today, all the people of Tibet are celebrating this holiday of great historical significance with the most excitement and joy. The people of all fraternal nationalities in the motherland are also joyfully expressing their congratulations. I express my heartfelt and warm congratulations with infinite joy.
    The establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region is the common wish of our Tibetan people. This wish has been realized for a year under the brilliant light of Chairman Mao's policy on nationalities. Under the correct leadership of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, under the unified leadership of the CPC Tibet Working Committee and the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region, and under the close unity of the entire anti-imperialist and patriotic united front and the joint efforts of all Tibetan and Han cadres and the entire Tibetan people, the various tasks in the Tibet region have greatly developed and achieved remarkable results.
    In the past year, through the efforts of all parties and the concerted efforts of the Dalai Lama and myself, the unity of monks and lay officials and the people of Tibet, the unity of the Han and Tibetan nationalities, and the unity of all strata within Tibet have been further developed and consolidated. Based on the close unity between nationalities and within nationalities, the progress of the various tasks of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region is very encouraging. For example, education, culture, health, transportation, and the training of ethnic minority cadres, production and construction, and other work have achieved greater achievements than ever before. This is something we should all be gratified and congratulated for.
    In the future, we will also do many new things that are more conducive to the development of Tibet. We must follow the instructions of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao and work hard with the policy of "unity, progress, and greater development," so that our Tibetan people can gradually complete the historical task of moving towards a prosperous and happy socialist society. In other words: We must, in the spirit of the Buddha's salvation of all living beings, and in accordance with the principle taught in the Buddhist scriptures of "do no evil, do all good," under the light of Sakyamuni Buddha, the field of merit of great compassion for all beings, we must gradually build Tibet into a happy and perfect paradise, just like the mainland of the motherland. To this end, all our Tibetan monks, lay officials, and people of all strata must be more closely united around the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, under the unified leadership of the CPC Tibet Working Committee and the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region headed by the Dalai Lama, further strengthen the unity between nationalities and within nationalities, continue to carry forward the spirit of anti-imperialism and patriotism, study hard, work actively, and strive for the greater development of all undertakings in Tibet, for the early realization of a unified Tibet Autonomous Region, and for the construction of a prosperous Buddhist and happy people's Tibet.

    为建设佛教兴隆和人民幸福的西藏而奋斗
    班禅额尔德尼
    西藏自治区筹备委员会成立到今天已经整整一年了，今天全西藏人民都以最兴奋愉快的心情，来庆祝这个具有伟大历史意义的节日，祖国各兄弟民族人民也都欢欣鼓舞地表示祝贺，我满怀无限欣喜的心情，表示衷心的热烈的祝贺。
    西藏自治区筹备委员会的成立，是我们西藏人民的共同愿望，这个愿望在毛主席民族政策的光辉照耀下，已经实现了一年了，我们在中央和毛主席的正确领导下，在中共西藏工委和自治区筹备委员会的统一领导下，在整个反帝爱国统一战线的紧密团结和全体藏汉族工作人员以及全藏人民齐心努力下，西藏地区的各项工作是有了很大的发展，并获得了显著的成绩。
    一年以来，经过各方面的努力以及达赖喇嘛和我个人的同心努力，全藏僧俗官员和人民群众的团结，汉藏民族和西藏内部各阶层的团结，是更加发展和更加巩固了，在民族之间和民族内部的亲密团结的基础上，自治区筹备委员会各项工作的进展，是令人十分振奋的。举如：文教、卫生、交通运输、民族干部的培养，生产建设等工作都比以往任何时候取得了重大的成就。这是值得我们共同庆幸而祝贺的。
    今后，我们还要作许多新的和更有利于西藏发展的各项事情，我们一定要遵循着中央和毛主席的指示，以“团结、进步、更加发展”的方针来努力工作，使我们西藏民族逐步地完成走向繁荣幸福的社会主义社会的历史任务。也就是说：我们要本着佛陀普渡众生的精神，本着佛经中教导的“诸恶莫行，众普奉行”的原则，在我们众生的大慈大悲福田释迦牟尼佛光照示下，一定要把西藏跟祖国内地一样的逐步建设成幸福美满的极乐世界。为此，我们全藏僧俗官员和各阶层群众，就必须更亲密地团结在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的周围，在中共西藏工委和以达赖喇嘛为首的西藏自治区筹备委员会的统一领导下，进一步加强民族之间和民族内部的团结，继续发扬反帝爱国的精神，努力学习、积极工作，为西藏各项事业的更加发展，为早日实现统一的西藏自治区、为建设佛教兴隆和人民幸福的西藏而奋斗。
