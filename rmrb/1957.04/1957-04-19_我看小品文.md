    My Views on Essays
    Hu Zuyu
    Essays have been "in vogue" in recent years, frequently appearing in newspapers and magazines. Some publications even feature them in every issue, as if they have become the "soul" of the publication, indispensable at all times. I feel that if essays are solely used as a tool for satire, and published excessively, even becoming a trend, then it's not very appropriate.

    First, there should be a distinction between satire and criticism in their application, and they should not be confused. This is because criticism is a tool for resolving contradictions among the people, and it should also achieve unity. This is something that should be conducted seriously and earnestly. If satire is mixed into criticism, it will make people feel that the criticism is not serious, because satire can make the target feel embarrassed, and it has a meaning of humiliation or contempt. The criticized person will think that this kind of criticism is frivolous and insincere, and will adopt a perfunctory attitude of feigned acceptance; the criticized person may also think that this kind of criticism is disguised attack, containing hostility or discrimination, and refuse to accept it, so that unity cannot be achieved through it.

    Secondly, satire can be used among the people, but the targets should be different from the targets of criticism. For general mistakes or shortcomings of comrades, criticism should be used to resolve them; but for those who are comrades, but whose mistakes or shortcomings have reached an extremely dangerous point, that is, their nature is transforming from contradictions among the people to contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, and who repeatedly refuse to change after repeated criticism, then satire is the only option. If there is such a clear boundary between criticism and satire, then essays will not be used excessively, satirizing everything, no matter how trivial. With this kind of use of satire, the subjects of essays will be selected. It will not be like in the past, where trivial matters could be used as the subject of essays. With limited subject selection, the role of essays in propaganda work will definitely be valued, and it will not be because the subject matter is unlimited, excessive and excessive, making the future of essays crisis-ridden.

    Thirdly, since essays were regarded by Lu Xun as "daggers" and "javelins" in the past, we should not regard them as "word games" today. Because if we only focus on their amusement, authors will inevitably rack their brains to fabricate some specious plots or deliberately distort and exaggerate real problems to achieve the purpose of making people laugh, which will reduce the prestige of essays among the masses, and only leave them with wit, humor, and amusement. This is equivalent to disarming the combat force of essays. If such facts exist objectively, and are relatively common and significant, in order to attract the attention of the masses, the facts should be embellished and highlighted, and analyzed and criticized from a principled height, pointing out the advantages and disadvantages, right and wrong. Even if there is some humor in this, it is permissible, because this strengthens the combativeness of essays.

    Although essays are short, they are concise and powerful. They are like diamonds, which can penetrate the most solid things, and are indestructible. If you use a diamond to cut tofu, its effect will definitely not be as good as an ordinary kitchen knife. The role of essays is also the same. If they are used randomly, they will lose their due effect among the masses. In propaganda, the existence of essays is necessary, but they should not be used too much or excessively.

    我看小品文
    胡祖宇
    小品文在近几年里大走“运”，经常可以在报纸和杂志上看到它；有的刊物甚至每期必登，好像它已成了这刊物的“灵魂”，时刻不能离开。我觉得如果小品文只单纯地用来作为讽刺的工具的话，发表得过多了，甚至形成为一种风尚，那就不怎么合适了。
    首先，讽刺和批评在运用时应有区别，不应当混同。因为批评是解决人民内部矛盾的工具，而且还要通过它来达到团结的目的。这是应该严肃认真进行的事情。如果在批评里再夹杂着讽刺，那就会使人感到这种批评不是正经味儿，因为讽刺能使对象哭笑不得，而且有一种污辱或轻蔑的意味。被批评者会认为这种批评是轻浮和不诚恳的，而采取玩忽的态度来虚意接受；也会被批评者认为这种批评是变相的打击，是含有敌意或歧视，而拒不接受，结果通过它不能达到团结的目的。
    其次，讽刺在人民内部是可以运用的，但对象应和批评的对象有所区别。对同志的一般性的错误或缺点，应采用批评的方式来解决；而对那些虽是同志，而其所犯的错误或存在的缺点，严重程度已经达到极其危险的地步，也就是说其性质正由人民内部矛盾向敌我矛盾转化，并且是屡经批评不加稍改的，就只有采用讽刺的办法。如果批评和讽刺有了这样划分的界限，那就使小品文不致运用过滥，事无大小，一概使用讽刺；这样运用讽刺，也就使小品文的题材有所选择了；不像过去鸡毛蒜皮的事情都可以用来作为小品文的题材；选择题材有了界限，小品文在宣传工作中的作用，一定会被人重视起来，而不致因为题材毫无限制，过多过滥，使小品文的前途上危机四伏。
    再其次，小品文在过去既然被鲁迅视为“匕首”和“投枪”，在今天我们就不应该把它当成“文字游戏”来看待。因为只重视其趣味，在写小品文的时候，作者就难免挖空心思，虚构一些似是而非的情节，或把现实问题故意歪曲夸大，以达到引人发笑的目的，这样就会降低小品文在群众中的威信，而只存在诙谐、幽默和趣味。这也就等于解除了小品文的战斗武装。如果客观存在这种事实，并且是比较普遍和重大的，为了引起群众注意，在事实的基础上加以渲染烘托，并提到原则的高度来加以分析批判，指出利害或是非，这样纵然有些幽默的意味，也是可以的，因为这些加强了小品文的战斗性。
    小品文虽是短小的，但是精悍的，它好比金钢钻，能钻透最坚固的东西，而且是无坚不摧的。如果用金钢钻来切豆腐，其作用一定不如一把普通的切菜刀。小品文的作用也是这样，如果乱用它，就会在群众中失去其应得的效果。在进行宣传中，小品文的存在是有必要的，但不可用得过多、过滥。
