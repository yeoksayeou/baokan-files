Expedite the Issuance of This Year's Construction and Installation Tasks
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

The weather is now quite warm, making it a suitable season for construction and installation projects. Various central ministries held meetings of basic construction factory directors and construction company managers in February and March. In addition to summarizing and exchanging last year's construction experiences, these meetings also studied this year's construction tasks. To date, the majority of internal construction and installation tasks have been assigned to grassroots units. Some units are preparing to start work, while others have already started or are continuing construction. However, most of the subcontracted construction and installation tasks have not yet been assigned to grassroots units. For example, the construction and installation tasks contracted by the Ministry of Construction Engineering had not been issued by the end of March. The construction and installation departments in various provinces (cities) are also waiting for projects to be issued by the central ministries and local departments. As a result, both the client departments and the contractor departments are anxious. The higher levels have tasks that have not been assigned, while the lower levels are waiting idly without tasks.

Why haven't the construction and installation tasks been assigned? And can they be assigned quickly?

This year's investment plan was finalized relatively late. Because the investment amount is less than last year, some departments have been unable to decide which projects to "dismount," and as a result, they have not issued the construction and installation tasks for the projects to be built. However, the uncertainty only affects a small number of construction projects; the majority of projects can be determined. The uncertainty of a small number of construction projects should not affect the assignment of construction and installation tasks for the majority of projects.

According to the quotas calculated by the construction units and the State Economic Commission's materials allocation departments, there are enough major materials this year; according to the materials quotas of the construction units, the major materials are only 80% of the required quantity. Therefore, some departments are afraid that there will be work stoppages due to insufficient materials after the tasks are assigned, so the tasks have been delayed. These departments should first quickly assign the construction and installation tasks to the grassroots level, and then carefully calculate and save materials, while also re-calculating the quotas. By no means should the progress of construction tasks be affected by the study of material quota issues.

This year, there have been significant improvements in the contracting methods for construction and installation projects contracted by the Ministry of Construction Engineering. For many issues, the state only provides general principles, without specific regulations, making it difficult to implement, which has also affected the assignment of construction and installation tasks. Indeed, due to a lack of experience, some new problems and difficulties will be encountered in implementing the new contracting methods. In addition to hoping that the State Construction Commission will make some supplementary regulations, other specific problems and difficulties can only be resolved through research in actual work. If they cannot be resolved at the grassroots level, they can be resolved by the provincial (municipal) people's committees or submitted to the relevant higher-level authorities. In short, this should not affect the work or the assignment of construction and installation tasks.

Because the investment amount this year is less than last year, the construction and installation forces of various departments and provinces (cities) have a surplus. In order to minimize idle labor, some departments and provinces (cities) have assigned construction and installation tasks to their own construction and installation enterprises. Because some places have tasks but lack the manpower, they are preparing to mobilize forces over long distances. From the perspective of the central ministries, this seems to make sense. However, from the perspective of the provinces (cities), it is felt that the forces of the central ministries should not be mobilized. Mobilizing forces not only incurs relocation costs, but also makes it difficult for workers to settle down. This problem needs to be resolved, but achieving a unified construction organization by region, regardless of which plan is adopted, involves several central and local departments. Therefore, resolving this problem will take some time. The arrangement of construction and installation tasks this year can only be adjusted based on recognizing the status quo. From the perspective of the central ministries, they should try to minimize the mobilization of construction forces, and quickly subcontract tasks that can be undertaken by local or other central ministries. From the perspective of the local areas, they should try to arrange certain tasks for the original and already transferred or being transferred forces of the central ministries, so that construction and installation tasks that have not been assigned can find contractors.

In short, except for changes in construction plans approved by the state, no other reason should prevent the assignment of construction and installation tasks to the grassroots level. Otherwise, it will not only lead to a rush for work in the third quarter, but also affect the completion of the state's basic construction plan.

In order to minimize idle labor at the grassroots level, and in order to take advantage of this good season, it is hoped that various departments will quickly assign construction and installation tasks to the grassroots level.

    迅速下达今年的建筑安装任务
    本报评论员
    目前天气已相当暖和，正是比较适合于建筑安装工程施工的季节。中央各部在二三月间都先后开过基本建设厂长和建筑公司经理会议。这些会议除总结和交流了去年建设的经验以外，也研究了今年的建设任务。到目前为止，大部分内包建筑安装工程任务已下达到基层单位，有些单位正在准备开工，有些单位已经开工或正在继续进行施工。但是，外包的建筑安装工程任务却大部分没有下达到基层单位，例如建筑工程部承包的建筑安装任务，到3月底还没有下达。各省（市）的建筑安装部门也在等中央各部和地方各部门的发包工程。因此，甲方部也着急，乙方部也着急。上边有任务没有下达，下边无任务就窝工等着。
    建筑安装工程任务为什么没有下达呢？能不能迅速下达呢？
    今年投资计划定得较晚，由于投资额比去年减少，有些部门有哪些工程要“下马”，定不下来，他们就没有把要建设的项目的建筑安装工程任务下达下去。可是，不能确定的只涉及到少数的建设项目，大多数项目是可以确定下来的，少数建设项目不定，不应该影响多数建设项目的建筑安装任务下达。
    按建设单位和国家经济委员会物资分配部门的定额计算，今年的主要材料够了；按施工单位的材料定额计算，主要材料只有需要数量的80％。因此，有些部门怕任务下达以后材料不够又要停工，任务也就迟迟不能下达。这些部门应该先把建筑安装任务迅速下达到基层，然后一方面精打细算，节约用料，一方面再核算定额。千万不要因材料定额问题的研究，影响建设任务的进行。
    今年建筑工程部承包的建筑安装工程，包工方式有很大改进，很多问题国家只有原则规定，没有具体规定，不好执行，这也影响了建筑安装任务的下达。的确，由于没有经验，在贯彻新的承包方式中会遇到一些新的问题和困难。除希望国家建设委员会再作一些补充规定以外，其他具体问题和困难，只有在实际工作中经过研究加以解决，在基层不能解决时，可请省（市）人民委员会解决，或者交上级有关机关解决。总之不应该因此影响工作或影响建筑安装任务的下达。
    由于今年投资额比去年减少，各部门和各省（市）的建筑安装力量都有多余，某些部门和省（市）为了使自己的建筑安装力量少窝工，就把建筑安装任务交给自己的建筑安装企业承担。由于有些地方有任务，没有力量，就准备远距离调动力量。从中央各部来看，这样作似乎很有道理。但从省（市）来看，觉得中央各部门的力量不应该调动，调动力量不但要花调迁费，而职工跑来跑去生活不能安定。这个问题是需要解决的，但要达到按地区统一建筑组织，不论采用何种方案，都牵涉到中央和地方若干部门。因此解决这个问题需要一定的时间。今年建筑安装任务的安排就只能在承认现状的基础上加以调整。从中央各部来说，应该是尽量少调动建筑力量，能够交地方或中央其他部承担的任务，应迅速进行发包。从地方来说，应该尽量给中央各部原有的和已经调去的或正在调去的力量安排一定的任务，以便于没有分配的建筑安装任务，能找到承包单位。
    总之，除了国家同意变更建设计划以外，其他任何理由，都不应妨碍建筑安装任务向基层下达，否则，不仅会造成第三季度抢工，而且会影响国家基本建设计划的完成。
    为了基层少窝工，为了利用这个好的季节，希望各部门迅速将建筑安装任务下达到基层去。
