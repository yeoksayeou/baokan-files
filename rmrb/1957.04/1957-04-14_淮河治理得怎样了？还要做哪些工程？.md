The person in charge of the Huai River Management Committee talks about:
The benefits of Huai River management have exceeded the total national investment. The current Huai River management project cannot completely resist the exceptionally large floods that occur once every hundred years because: in addition to the complexity of the Huai River itself, there are also some shortcomings in the work. In order to thoroughly harness the Huai River, the state will allocate a large amount of funds. It is expected that the appearance of the Huai River will undergo fundamental changes in the next ten years or so.
Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, 12th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Li Minghui reported: The Huai River management project has entered its seventh year, but how is the Huai River currently being managed? What projects still need to be done in the future? In order to clarify these issues of general concern, the reporter recently interviewed a person in charge of the Huai River Management Committee.

The person in charge of the Huai River Management Committee said that the achievements in Huai River management over the past six years have been encouraging. In the entire Huai River basin, seven large mountain valley reservoirs have been built, twelve large lake and depression flood storage projects have been built, and the Xianghongdian Reservoir and the Mozi Tan Reservoir, which are under construction, can be used for flood control during the flood season this year. These projects can store a total of more than 28.5 billion cubic meters of floodwater. At the same time, the length of large and small rivers dredged and sorted totals more than 7,600 kilometers, and the dikes, including the Huai River Dam, have been renovated for more than 5,800 kilometers. In the past six years, nearly 700 million cubic meters of earthwork have been completed, and the state has invested 800 million yuan. At present, the main streams of the Huai River can already defend against large floods equivalent to the type of flood in 1954, and some plain areas can generally be exempted from floods that occur once every five years. If we compare the losses and benefits of the entire basin before and after Huai River management with the same rainfall pattern, then the benefits of Huai River management in the past six years have exceeded the total national investment in Huai River management.

The person in charge also said that although the Huai River management project has achieved such brilliant achievements, it does not mean that all the problems existing in the Huai River have been solved. In 1956, a serious flood occurred, and more than 10 million acres of farmland in the Huaibei Plain suffered varying degrees of damage. In terms of the earliness, concentration, and continuity of rainfall, this flood was a flood that occurs once every fifty years. The current Huai River management project cannot eliminate such large floods, nor can it completely resist the exceptionally large floods that occur once every hundred years.

Then, the person in charge emphasized that the reason why the Huai River has not been completely managed well until now is primarily determined by the complexity of the Huai River itself. He said that the characteristics of the Huai River in terms of meteorology and hydrology are small annual rainfall and large flood discharge. It is a river with special conditions in our country. In terms of topography, the Huai River is a mountainous area in the upper reaches, with a large drop and fast flow rate; however, after entering Anhui Province, the riverbed in the middle reaches is flat, and the flow rate slows down. In addition, it is very close to the rainy Huainan mountainous area. Once there is a rainstorm, mountain floods will quickly strike, thus forming a lasting flood peak. Although the flood in 1956 was a flood that occurs once every fifteen years, the flood peak in the middle reaches lasted for more than two months. In addition to the main stream of the Huai River, the plain area of the Huai River basin is very large, with the water area of the Huaibei slope in the upper and middle reaches reaching 94,000 square kilometers. Due to the repeated flooding of the Yellow River into the Huai River in the past, all the river channels and ditches in these areas have been silted up by Yellow River sediment, and the natural drainage system has been destroyed. Once there is a rainstorm in these areas, and they are affected by the high water level of the Huai River, the rainwater cannot be discharged, resulting in floods. Due to the complexity of the Huai River, it can be seen that in terms of flood control, the several reservoirs that have been built and are under construction are not enough, and the management of the tributaries in the past was also very insufficient.

The person in charge said that it should be admitted that the Huai River Management Committee did not have a sufficient understanding of the complexity and long-term nature of thoroughly harnessing the Huai River in the early stage. At that time, some people in the Huai River Management Committee believed that the problem could be solved by doing a few large projects and sorting out the river channels and dikes. Moreover, there was insufficient data and a lack of experience when the Huai River management began, so the standards adopted for the completed projects were mostly too low. In the early stage of Huai River management, the Huai River Management Committee had a simple flood control perspective and ignored the flood drainage project.

The person in charge said that, in general, the experience of Huai River management in the past six years is rich, and the lessons are beneficial. Due to the two serious internal floods and one exceptionally large flood in the past six years, the Huai River Management Committee has further understood the characteristics of the Huai River, and it is possible to re-correct the standards for flood control and flood drainage. On this basis, the Huai River Management Committee mobilized a large number of technical forces to complete the overall plan for thoroughly harnessing the Huai River basin.

Finally, the person in charge of the Huai River Management Committee said that the task of Huai River management in the future is still very arduous. In order to realize the overall plan for thoroughly harnessing the Huai River basin, the state will allocate a large amount of funds. In terms of flood control, more than a dozen reservoirs will be built in the upper and middle reaches of the Huai River in the future. The reservoir planned to be built at the Xiashankou on the main stream of the Huai River, with a flood storage capacity of more than 20 billion cubic meters, will become the hub for controlling floods in the middle reaches of the Huai River. In terms of flood drainage, a series of arduous projects will be carried out in the future to eliminate floods that occur once every ten to twenty years. In terms of irrigation, shipping, and power generation, the workload is also huge. He said that although the situation of the Huai River is complex and the engineering task is arduous, the level of construction and management has been greatly improved after years of practical training, and the technical force is also stronger than before. Therefore, the people participating in Huai River management have full confidence in completing the task of Huai River management. It is expected that after these projects are completed in the next ten years or so, the appearance of the Huai River will undergo fundamental changes, and the historically disaster-prone Huai River will then forever benefit mankind.

    淮河治理得怎样了？还要做哪些工程？
    治淮委员会负责人谈：
    治淮收益已超过国家投资总额。目前治淮工程还不能全部抗御百年一遇的特大洪水，原因是：除淮河本身的复杂性以外，工作中还有一些缺点。为了根治淮河，国家还将拿一笔数量较大的资金。预计今后十年左右，淮河的面貌将会发生根本变化。
    据新华社蚌埠12日电　新华社记者李明回报道：治淮工程已经进入第七个年头，但是目前淮河究竟治理得怎样了？今后还要做哪些工程？为了弄清这些为人们普遍关心的问题，记者最近访问了治淮委员会的一位负责人。
    治淮委员会负责人说，过去六年多，淮河治理的成绩是令人振奋的。整个淮河流域，大型山谷水库修成了七座，较大的湖泊洼地蓄洪工程建成了十二处，正在兴建的响洪甸水库和磨子潭水库今年汛期就可以拦洪，这些工程共可拦蓄洪水两百八十五亿多公方。同时，疏浚整理大小河道长度共达七千六百多公里，整修包括淮河大堤在内的堤防五千八百多公里。六年多所做的土方近七亿公方，国家投资达八亿元。目前，淮河主要干流已经可以防御相当于1954年类型的大洪水，一些平原地区一般已经可以免除五年一遇的涝灾。如果以治淮前和治淮后同样的雨型来比较损失和收益，那么治淮六年多全流域的收益已经超过国家对治淮的投资总额。
    这位负责人还说，治淮工程虽然已经有如此辉煌的成就，但并不是淮河所存在的问题都解决了。1956年发生严重涝灾，淮北平原便有一千多万亩农田遭受轻重不同的灾害。从雨量的提早、集中、连续的程度上来说，这次涝灾是属于五十年一遇的涝灾。目前治淮工程还不能免除这样大的涝灾，也还不能全部抗御百年一遇的特大洪水。
    接着，这位负责人着重指出，淮河到现在所以没有完全治理好，首先是由于淮河本身的复杂性所决定的。他说，淮河在气象和水文上的特征是年雨量小，而洪水量大。它是我国一条情况特殊的河流。在地形条件上，淮河在上游是山区，落差大，流速快；而进入安徽省境以后，中游河床平坦，流速放慢，加上同多雨的淮南山区距离很近，一遇暴雨，山洪就迅速袭来，因而形成持久的洪峰。1956年的洪水虽属十五年一遇的洪水，中游洪峰却持续了两个多月。除淮河干流外，淮河流域平原面积很大，仅上、中游淮北坡水区域即达九万四千平方公里。这些地区由于过去黄河屡次向淮河泛滥，所有河道沟渠都被黄河泥沙淤积，天然排水系统遭到了破坏。这些地区一遇暴雨，再受淮河高水位顶托的影响，结果雨水无法宣泄，造成涝灾。由于淮河这种复杂性，可以看出：在防洪上，已经修建和正在修建的几座水库是不够的，过去对各支流的治理也很不够。
    这位负责人说，应该承认，治淮委员会在初期对根治淮河的复杂性和长期性是认识不足的。当时治淮委员会曾有人认为做几个大工程，整理一下河道、堤防，问题就解决了。而且开始治淮时资料不够，经验缺乏，以致已做工程采用的标准大多偏低。在治淮初期，治淮委员会又存在单纯的防洪观点，忽视了除涝工程。
    这位负责人说，总的讲，过去六年多治淮的经验是丰富的，教训是有益的。由于六年多遭受两次严重内涝和一次特大洪水，使治淮委员会进一步摸清淮河的性格，有可能重新校正防洪和除涝的标准。在这个基础上，治淮委员会动员了大批技术力量，完成了根治淮河流域总规划。
    最后，治淮委员会负责人说，今后治淮的任务还是十分艰巨的。为了实现根治淮河流域总规划，国家还将拿出一笔数量较大的资金。在防洪方面，淮河上、中游今后还要兴建十多座水库。计划在淮河干流峡山口修建的水库，蓄洪量达两百亿公方以上，将成为淮河中游控制洪水的枢纽。在除涝方面，今后将要做一系列艰巨的工程，以达到免除十年到二十年一遇的涝灾。在灌溉、航运、发电等方面，工作量也很巨大。他说，虽然淮河情况复杂，工程任务艰巨，但是经过几年来的实际锻炼，施工、管理的水平已经有很大的提高，技术力量也比以前雄厚了，因而参加治淮的人们对完成治淮任务具有充分的信心。预计今后十年左右，这些工程完成以后，淮河面貌将会发生根本的变化，历史上多灾多难的淮河，到那时将永远为人类造福。
