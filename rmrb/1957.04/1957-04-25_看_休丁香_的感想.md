Thoughts on Seeing "Xiu Dingxiang"
    Ai Wu
    A worker from the Beijing Liulihe Cement Factory was waiting in line at the train station when he struck up a conversation with a young woman in front of him. They discovered they were from the same hometown, and their conversation became even more lively. Consequently, they abandoned their train plans and decided to have dinner at a nearby restaurant. Three days later, they got married. However, less than a month later, they filed for divorce. It turned out that during their courtship, the man claimed to be a technician, but after the marriage, she discovered he was merely a manual laborer with a low income, which greatly dissatisfied her. Similarly, a worker from the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant was about to marry a woman. The woman took money to the Beijing Department Store to buy wedding items. On the bus back, she overheard people talking about her fiancé, revealing that he was a third-grade worker, not a fifth-grade worker as he had claimed. This meant a lower salary, and in a fit of anger, she also filed for divorce. Today, there are many such divorce cases in the courts. As a literary worker, I cannot help but feel concerned and a sense of serious responsibility. I feel I should write some works to help them and offer some advice. But how to write it? I hesitate to put pen to paper. On the evening of April 10th, I saw the Anhui Lu opera "Xiu Dingxiang" for the first time at the Beijing Theater. I was very pleased, feeling that such a good drama was exactly the kind of work I wanted to write. Although the content is about marriage stories of the past, it is extremely educational for unmarried young men and women today. Guo Dingxiang, due to a marriage arranged by her parents, married Zhang Wanlang, a wealthy landlord. One would expect that after marrying him, she would live a happy life with endless enjoyment. However, their temperaments clashed, and they could not get along. Guo Dingxiang endured beatings, scoldings, and compromises, but in the end, she was still abandoned. Guo Dingxiang left the Zhang family and met a woodcutter on the road. She married him, and although they were poor, they created a happy life through their joint efforts. Our young people today, after seeing this drama, will surely learn a good lesson on the issue of marriage.
    A drama with educational significance must have good actors and performances to achieve good results. Ding Yulan, in her portrayal of Guo Dingxiang, created a very touching image of an oppressed woman in the past feudal society, and expressed the pure, kind, gentle, and firm character of Guo Dingxiang extremely beautifully. When her mother asked Guo Dingxiang what suffering she had endured, Guo Dingxiang held back from telling. Only when her mother saw her injuries did she reveal a little. When her mother wanted to scold Zhang Wanlang, she even stopped her, saying: "Mother, if you live in this Zhang family village for half a day, I will have to accompany Zhang Lang for the rest of my life. It doesn't matter if you scold Zhang Lang, mother, but I am afraid that my daughter will suffer. I only hope that Zhang Lang will turn over a new leaf and that we can live a good life together as husband and wife." She would rather endure pain and compromise than tear apart their relationship in front of others. When Zhang Wanlang wanted to divorce her, she pleaded in every way possible, unwilling to divorce. But upon hearing Zhang Wanlang say such disgusting words: "When you go to the well to fetch water, even the Dragon King complains of a headache; if you go to the pond to wash clothes, the fish and shrimp in the pond will be plagued." "If I don't divorce Dingxiang in three years, the trees in the Zhang family will not bloom, and the grass will not be green." She resolutely shouted: "Don't say anymore, you... divorce me!" After Guo Dingxiang left Zhang's village, she felt that as a divorced woman, she had no face to return to her parents' home and was filled with grief. She wanted to throw herself into the river to commit suicide, but when she thought of the divorce paper, which stated "Eight reasons to divorce you: you are infertile and do not raise children; nine reasons to divorce you: you secretly give birth to babies or exchange babies," she angrily shouted: "No, no, I am a pure and innocent woman... I cannot die an unexplained death." Several years after Guo Dingxiang married the woodcutter Fan Sijiang, Zhang Wanlang came to her door begging for food one day. She couldn't wait to drive him away immediately, but seeing that he was blind and disabled, she wrote off the past hatred and only felt pity for him. This oppressed woman of the old era, with her strong and kind character, was portrayed extremely beautifully and vividly by Ding Yulan. In addition, the singing tunes came from Anhui folk songs, containing a strong atmosphere of life. I felt even more moved than when I saw the opera "Eugene Onegin." In the scene "Embroidered Silk Shirt," Guo Dingxiang didn't have needle and thread in her hand, but she used the various movements of embroidery to express the hope of achieving harmony with her husband through the embroidered clothes, giving people an unforgettable and real image. In the scene "Sighing Ten Miles," I couldn't help but burst into tears. "With grief and tears, I leave the village, heartbroken and with a broken heart. Where to go in this vast world? Where am I, a weak woman, running? Let the ox cart take me, but where will it take me? This ox cart is like my fate, Dingxiang, bumpy and without an end." These many sad lyrics are very touching. There is a poem in the Book of Songs called "Mang," which describes the sorrowful situation of an abandoned woman passing through the Qi River, making it unbearable to finish reading. But compared to Guo Dingxiang's image in plain white clothes passing through the wilderness in solitude, the latter is even more sympathetic and unforgettable.

    看“休丁香”的感想
    艾芜
    北京琉璃河水泥厂一个工人，在火车站排队等火车，同站在前面的一个年轻女人，随便谈了起来，发现是同乡，就谈得更是上劲，于是火车不等了，约着到近边饭馆去吃饭，三天后两人结了婚，可是不到一月，便到法院打离婚。原来谈情说爱的时候，男的说是技工，结婚后才发现是壮工，收入不多，女的就大为不满。又石景山钢铁厂一个工人刚同一个女的要结婚了，女的拿着钱到北京百货大楼买结婚衣物，回去的时候，在公共汽车上听人讲到她的未婚夫，原是一个三级工，并非五级工，这一来，显然工资少了，一怒之下，又到法院打离婚。今天在法院像这样的离婚案件很不少，作为一个文学工作者，不能不心怀隐忧，感到一种严重的责任，觉得应该写一些作品去帮助他们，尽一些忠告。但是怎样写呢？却是下笔踌躇。4月10日晚上在北京剧场第一次看见了安徽的庐剧“休丁香”，非常喜悦，觉得这样的好戏剧正是我想要写的一种作品。内容虽是讲过去的婚姻故事，但对现代未婚的青年男女，是极有教育意义的。郭丁香由于父母包办婚事，嫁给有钱的地主张万郎，应该是一嫁过去，就生活快乐享受不尽。谁知性情不相投，无法和好下去；郭丁香忍受打骂、委曲求全，到头还是遭到离弃。郭丁香离开张家，在路上遇见一个樵夫，与他结婚，虽然穷苦，但两人共同努力，便创造了幸福的生活。我们今天的年轻人，看看这个戏剧是会在婚姻问题上好好上一课的。
    一个富有教育意义的戏剧，必须有好的演员，演出才能收到很好的效果。丁玉兰扮演郭丁香，把过去封建社会里面那种被压迫的妇女形象，塑造得非常动人，把郭丁香心地纯良、外柔内刚的性格，表现得极其优美。母亲问郭丁香受到什么痛苦，郭丁香忍着不说。等到看见她有伤痕，她才吐露一点。母亲要责备张万郎，她还阻止母亲说：“娘在这张家庄上住半日，儿可要终身伴张郎。你责张郎不要紧，母亲呀，只怕女儿苦难当。儿只盼张郎回头能学好、夫妻和好过日光。”她宁愿忍受痛苦，委曲求全，不跟丈夫在第三者面前撕破面皮。张万郎要休她，她百般哀求不愿离婚，但一听见张万郎说出那样嫌恶的话：“你到井上去打水，老龙王都要喊头疼；你若塘里去洗衣裳，塘里的鱼虾也发瘟。”“三年不休掉丁香女，张家树不开花草不青。”她就毅然决然地喊道：“你不再讲了，你……休吧！”郭丁香离开张家庄，觉得被休弃之女，无颜回到娘家，心中不胜悲哀，很想投河自杀；但想起休书上写的“八休你，不生不养，九休你，偷生换熟”，又忿怒地喊出：“不，不，我是个清清白白的女子，……我不能不明不白的死哇。”郭丁香同樵夫范四江结婚之后数年，有一天张万郎到她门口讨饭，她恨不得立刻将他赶走，但因见他双眼已瞎，成为残废，便把过去的仇恨，一笔钩销，对他只是怜悯。这个旧时代被压迫的女性有着坚强而又善良的性格，给丁玉兰表现得极其优美生动，再加歌唱的曲调来自安徽的民歌，含着浓厚的生活气息，我感到比我看“欧根·奥涅金”那个歌剧还要感动。在“绣罗衫”那一场，郭丁香手里没有针线，但拿着衣裳表现绣花的各种动作、与乎渴望由绣好衣裳得到夫妻和好的神情，给人一个难忘的真实的形象。在“叹十里”那一场，我是忍不住冒出了眼泪。“含悲忍泪出村庄，伤心人事欲断肠。天涯茫茫何处去，孤身弱女奔何方？任凭牛车载我去，载往何方是何方。这牛车好似我丁香命，颠颠簸簸无收场。”这许多悲哀的歌词，是非常打动人的。诗经上有一首叫做“氓”的诗，写一个被遗弃的妇女，经过淇水的悲伤情形，令人不忍卒读，但同郭丁香素衣白裙经过原野的孤苦情景比来，则后者更是令人同情，难以忘记的。
