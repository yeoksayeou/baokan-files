Cotton from the Middle East
    In the first four months of this year, the Shanghai Cotton Company has imported more than 250,000 dan (approximately 50 kg each) of cotton.

    This cotton was purchased from Egypt, Syria, and Pakistan, and some of it has already been sent to Shanghai's textile factories.

    During this period, Shanghai also imported more than 296,000 meters of cotton cloth from Yugoslavia. This cloth is white and suitable for people to make underwear for spring and autumn.

    中东来的棉花
    在今年的头四个多月中，上海市棉花公司已经进口了二十五万多担棉花。
    这些棉花是向埃及、叙利亚和巴基斯坦购买的，有一部分已经送进了上海的纺织工厂。
    这一时期里，上海还从南斯拉夫进口了二十九万六千多公尺棉布，这些布是白色的，适宜人们缝制春秋季的内衣。
