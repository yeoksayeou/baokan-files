What Can the Party Lead, and What Can't It Lead?
He Guozhu, Director of the Theoretical Physics Teaching and Research Group, Nankai University

In some scientific fields, the Party can lead and needs to lead. In some scientific fields, the Party "currently" cannot lead, and there is no need to force leadership.

Can the Party lead natural sciences? Regarding this question, my personal view is that we cannot definitively answer "yes" or "no." We can only say that "under the current circumstances," in certain aspects of science, the Party can lead, while in other aspects of science, the Party cannot yet lead. We must pay attention to the objective conditions of Party members in scientific knowledge "at present"; at the same time, we must also consider the scientific and professional requirements for leaders in those scientific fields to be led. Here, I particularly emphasize the words "under the current circumstances" or "at present." Because the Party is developing and progressing, some scientific fields that the Party cannot lead now may be led in the future. (It must be stated here that the science mentioned in this article refers to natural sciences, because the Party not only can already lead social sciences, but has also flexibly mastered social sciences, and generally, people have no objection to this.)

In some scientific fields, the Party can lead and needs to lead. Especially in some issues where science is related to other aspects, the Party must lead. For example, issues related to science and the national economy, science and national defense, science and social needs, science and international relations, etc. Because scientists may not have a comprehensive understanding of these aspects, the Party needs to make comprehensive considerations and arrangements to make it more conducive to the development of socialism. At the same time, leaders in these areas generally do not need to have in-depth knowledge of a specific scientific specialty, but only require broad general knowledge, which Party comrades can quickly learn and master. Generally, scientists, although proficient in their specialized fields, may not all be well-versed in general knowledge. The division of labor between the Party and scientists in these issues is very important. If the Party can do more leadership work in these areas, it can free up more time for scientists to devote more energy to their professional work.

In some more complex scientific research fields, such as the peaceful utilization of atomic energy, not only a large number of physicists are needed, but also chemists, engineers, mathematicians, biologists, technicians, and a large number of workers; the smooth progress requires the cooperation of hundreds or even thousands of people. In this case, the unified leadership of the Party is even more necessary; not only specialized business leadership but also general leadership is needed. Because such large-scale scientific research will inevitably involve national economy and the mobilization of talent and other issues, unified planning and handling must be done. The Party will play a major role in these areas.

In some scientific fields, the Party "currently" cannot lead, and there is no need to force leadership. We cannot and should not deny that the number of scientists within the Party is still very small. It is impossible to lead everywhere and take care of everything in detail. We should be realistic and focus the Party's strength more on some important scientific leadership aspects that have a great influence. As for general scientific departments that do not seriously involve national plans and social development, we should temporarily give scientists more freedom; especially regarding special professional issues, we should respect the opinions of scientists. In pure scientific and technological issues, as long as it does not affect the country's overall planning, it should be led and resolved by scientists themselves. For example, dealing with rationalization proposals on technology, which rationalization proposals can be adopted, and which proposals are too radical, etc. For these technical professional issues, I think it is best to let scientists who understand the business study, judge, and decide. The Party can take an advisory and assisting attitude. On the one hand, the Party itself should also strive to understand the business and cultivate itself so that it can gradually reach a level where it can lead.

At the same time, whether the Party can lead a certain scientific field or a certain scientific unit completely depends on objective conditions. The main point here is not whether the Party itself thinks it can lead, but whether the masses think a certain Party member can lead. In this regard, the Party should appropriately understand whether scientists are convinced by the leadership of a certain Party member. The Party should pay more attention to the leader's professional and political level, and not simply look at whether the leader is a Party member or not. Because some scientific fields require leaders to have a high professional level, while other scientific fields may require leaders to have a high political level. In the current situation where the number of Party members with a high level of expertise is not sufficient, we should appropriately consider allowing scientists to lead in some areas.

As for whether the Party should strive to lead in all aspects of science in the future, or whether scientists should still be allowed to lead themselves in professional and technical aspects in the future, I cannot provide mature opinions yet. This issue needs to be carefully studied; at least for now, the Party does not need to strive to lead in every aspect of science. The way to solve the problem lies in improving the political level of scientists, respecting scientists' opinions on professional technology, and enabling them to fully exert their due initiative in their work.

Since some people have doubts about whether the Party can lead science, the reason for this doubt may be due to deviations caused by individual Party cadres overemphasizing the Party's leadership in certain scientific fields. I hope the Party will investigate and correct this. On the other hand, I also hope that some scientists will not often be self-righteous, subjectively exaggerate their professional knowledge excessively, and deny the correctness of the Party's leadership without carefully and earnestly understanding all aspects of the problem.

    党能领导哪些不能领导哪些
    南开大学理论物理教研组主任　何国柱
    有些科学方面，党能领导，也需要党来领导。有些科学方面党“现在”还不能领导，同时也不必勉强领导。
    党能不能领导自然科学？对于这个问题，我个人的看法是，我们不能肯定地回答“能”或是“不能”。我们只能说在“现在情况下”，在科学的某些方面，党能领导，在科学的其他一些方面，党还不能领导。我们必须注意到“现在”党内同志在科学知识上的客观条件；同时也要注意到所要领导的那些科学方面对领导人的科学业务要求如何而定。在这里，我特别注重“现在情况下”或是“现在”这几个字。因为党是在发展的，在进步的，现在党不能领导的某些科学方面，将来都可能领导。（这里必须声明，本文中提到的科学都指自然科学而言，因为党不但已经能领导社会科学，而且已经灵活掌握了社会科学，一般人在这方面都没有异议。）
    有些科学方面，党能领导，也需要党来领导。尤其是当科学和其他方面有关联的一些问题中，必须党来领导。例如科学和国家经济的问题，科学与国防，科学与社会需要，科学与国际关系问题等等。因为在这些方面科学家了解的就不全面，需要党作全面的考虑和安排，使更有利于社会主义的发展。同时，这方面的领导人，一般不需要有某门特殊专业科学的精深知识，而只要求有广泛的一般性知识，而这种知识，党内同志是能够很快地学到，并达到能掌握的地步。一般科学家们，虽然在自己专长的专业内很精通，但对一般的普遍知识则未必就都能通晓。党和科学家在这些问题上的分工就显得很重要。如果党在这些方面多做些领导工作，就可以争取出更多的时间来使科学家们能更多用些精力在他们自己的业务方面。
    在一些比较繁复错综的科学研究方面，例如原子能和平利用方面，不但需要大量的物理学家，也需要化学家、工程师、数学家、生物学家、技师和大量的工人；要有几百人甚至几千人的合作才能顺利进行。在这种情况下，就更需要党的统一领导；不但需要专门业务的领导，也需要一般的领导。因为这样庞大的科学研究，就一定会牵扯到国家经济和调动人才等问题，必须要做统一的筹划和处理。党在这些方面将起主要作用。
    在有些科学方面党“现在”还不能领导，同时也不必勉强领导。我们不能也不必否认现在党内科学家数目仍然很少，要想处处都领导，面面都照顾到，事实上是不可能的。应当实事求是地把党的力量多放些在比较重要的，影响大的一些科学领导方面。至于一般不严重牵涉到国家计划和社会发展的科学部门，暂时应当多放手给科学家们；尤其是有关特殊专业问题，应当尊重科学家的意见。在纯科学技术问题上，只要不影响国家的总规划，应当由科学家自己来领导和解决。例如处理技术上的合理化建议问题，哪些合理化建议可以采纳，哪些建议太冒进等。这些有关技术专业的问题，我认为最好让懂业务的科学家们来研究、判断和决定。党可以采取建议和协助的态度。一方面党自己也应当在业务上争取搞通，培养自己使能渐渐达到能领导的水平。
    同时，党能不能领导某一科学方面或某一科学单位，完全要看客观条件。这里主要的还不是党自己认为能不能领导的问题，而是群众认为某个党员能不能领导的问题，在这方面，党要适当了解科学家们对某个党员的领导服不服。党应该多注重领导人的业务水平和政治水平，不能单纯地看领导人是党员或者不是党员。因为有些科学方面对领导人要求有很高的业务水平，另外一些科学方面对领导人可能要求高度的政治水平。在目前有高度业务水平的党员数目还不够的情况下，在有些方面应当适当考虑让科学家们来领导。
    至于党是不是应该争取将来在科学各个方面都领导，或是将来仍然让科学家在专业技术方面自己领导这问题，我还不能提供成熟的意见。这问题有仔细研究的必要；至少在目前，党还不必在科学每个方面都争取领导。解决问题的方法，在于提高科学家们的政治水平，尊重科学家对专业技术的意见，使他们能充分发挥在工作方面应有的积极性。
    既然有些人对党能不能领导科学抱有怀疑态度，产生这种怀疑态度的原因可能是由于个别党员干部在某些科学方面过于强调党的领导而发生偏差所引起的。希望党在这方面予以调查和纠正。另一方面，也希望某些科学家们不要常常自以为是，主观过分地夸张自己的业务知识，不仔细认真明了问题的各个方面就否定党领导的正确性。
