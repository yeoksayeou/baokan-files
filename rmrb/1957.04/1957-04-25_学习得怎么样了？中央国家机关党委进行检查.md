    How Is the Learning Going?
    Central National Government Organs Party Committee Conducts Inspection
    The Central National Government Organs Party Committee of the Communist Party of China recently inspected the study of the speech by Chairman Mao Zedong at the Supreme State Conference on the correct handling of contradictions among the people in sixty-four party organizations of government organs. This inspection began on April 15th and ended on April 24th.
    Currently, the vast majority of leading cadres in central-level state organs have conveyed Chairman Mao Zedong's speech to cadres inside and outside the Party in their respective organs. Some units have organized two or three discussions. Some units have even formed study groups specifically for cadres at the director and bureau chief level and above.
    A few units have already begun to combine the discussion with the cadres' ideology and work. The units that have learned relatively well are those where leaders personally take charge and lead the study in an organized and planned manner. Some organs also collect problems encountered during the study, analyze and study these problems, and then take the summarized opinions and answers to the masses for discussion. This approach has been very effective. Such departments include the Ministry of Forestry Industry, the Ministry of Coal Industry, and the Ministry of Commerce. Some units have implemented the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" during the study, fully promoting democracy, allowing free expression, and conducting free discussions.
    During the inspection, it was found that many unit leaders have not fully realized that we are currently in a period of great social change. Some leaders of organs have not personally taken charge of leading this study; some responsible cadres of organs felt that they had done their job after a general relay of the speech; and some leading cadres of units have separated the study from increasing production and practicing economy, or from the business work of the organs. They have not closely integrated the study with the current work reality and ideological reality.
    The Central National Government Organs Party Committee believes that the leaders of each unit, especially the responsible persons of the Party Committee and Party Leadership Group, must personally take charge in order to carry out this study in depth. As this study gradually deepens, it will inevitably touch upon serious shortcomings and problems in the ideological methods and work methods of many comrades within the Party. Therefore, the Party member leading cadres of each unit must recognize this study as being at the height of a rectification campaign. The current study will create a good beginning for carrying out a rectification movement within the organs.

### 学习得怎么样了？中央国家机关党委进行检查

    学习得怎么样了？
    中央国家机关党委进行检查
    新华社24日讯　中国共产党中央国家机关委员会最近检查了六十四个机关党组织学习毛泽东主席在最高国务会议上关于如何正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的讲话。这次检查从4月15日开始到24日结束。
    目前，绝大部分中央一级国家机关的负责人，都已经向机关党内外干部传达了毛泽东主席的讲话，有的单位已经组织过两三次讨论。还有的单位专门把司长和局长以上的负责干部组成小组进行学习。
    有少数单位在学习中已开始结合干部的思想和工作来进行讨论。这些学得比较好的单位都是领导人亲自动手，有组织有计划地来领导学习。有的机关还搜集学习中的问题，对这些问题进行分析研究，然后把归纳的意见和答案拿到群众中去讨论。这样作的效果很好。这样做的有森林工业部、煤炭工业部、商业部等部门。有的单位在学习中贯彻了“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，充分发扬民主，畅所欲言，展开了自由的讨论。
    在检查中发现，有不少单位领导者还没有充分认识到目前我们正处在社会大变动时期，有的机关负责人没有亲自动手来领导这一学习；有的机关负责干部作了一般传达以后就万事大吉；还有的单位的领导干部把学习同增产节约、机关业务工作等割裂开来看待，没有把学习和当前的工作实际、思想实际密切结合起来。
    中央国家机关党委认为，各单位的领导人，首先是党委和党组的负责人必须亲自动手，才能使这一学习深入地展开。这一学习逐步深入下去，必然会触动党内许多同志思想方法和工作方法上的严重缺点和问题。因此，各单位的党员领导干部要把这个学习提到整风的高度来认识，当前的学习将为机关内开展整风运动造成一个良好的开端。
