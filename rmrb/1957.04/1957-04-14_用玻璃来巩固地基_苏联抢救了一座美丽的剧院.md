    Using Glass to Solidify the Foundation
    The Soviet Union Rescues a Beautiful Theater
    (Our dispatch) In the famous Soviet port city of Odessa, a beautiful opera house was built seventy years ago. The exterior and interior decoration of the theater were admirable. However, shortly after the theater was built, its fate became a problem. Due to the erosion of the soil under the foundation by groundwater, the theater's foundation began to sink. By 1900, the eastern part of the theater was eighteen centimeters lower than the western part. This put a building with a total volume of 100,000 cubic meters in danger.
    Soviet experts decided to find a way to solidify the soil and rescue this beautiful theater. Therefore, two years ago, a liquid glass factory was built not far from the theater. Then, a total of 2,300 boreholes, totaling more than twenty kilometers in length, were drilled around and under the theater, and six million liters of liquid glass were injected. After cooling, this liquid glass became as solid as stone. In this way, the soil could resist the groundwater. By the end of last year, the sinking of the theater had completely stopped. Now, the theater stands firmly on the glass foundation. (Attached picture)

### 用玻璃来巩固地基  苏联抢救了一座美丽的剧院

    用玻璃来巩固地基
    苏联抢救了一座美丽的剧院
    本报讯　在苏联著名的海港敖德萨市，七十年前曾建起了一座漂亮的歌剧院。剧院的外表和内部装璜设备的优美，都是令人赞叹不止的。但是，剧院建成后不久，它的命运就发生了问题。由于地基下的泥土受到地下水的冲刷，剧院地基开始下沉了。到1900年，剧院的东部就比西部低十八厘米了。这样一座体积共达十万立方公尺的建筑物就处在危险之中了。
    苏联专家们决定想办法使泥土变得坚固起来，抢救这座美丽的剧院。于是，两年以前，就在离剧院不远的地方建成了一个液体玻璃工厂，然后在剧院周围和下部共打了总长度达二十公里以上的二千三百个钻孔，灌入了六百万公升的液体玻璃。这种液体玻璃冷却后就变得像石头一样地坚固。这样，泥土就能抵抗住地下水了。到去年年底，剧院下沉的情况已经完全停止。现在，剧院已经牢固地耸立在玻璃地基上了。（附图片）
