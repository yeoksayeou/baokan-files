    西伦凯维兹在加尔各答说
    波兰必须参加华沙条约
    新华社新德里3日电　波兰总理西伦凯维兹4月2日在加尔各答举行的记者招待会上说明，波兰有必要参加华沙条约。他说：“我们不愿意独自面对德国军国主义。历史告诉我们，当波兰独自一个的时候，波兰就吃亏。因此，我们才同其他同样受德国军国主义威胁的国家组成联盟。”
    西伦凯维兹总理还说，波兰赞成德国统一，只要德国是一个和平民主的德国，不威胁它的邻国。他重申波兰赞成建立欧洲集体安全体系。
    谈到奥得—尼斯边界问题时，西伦凯维兹说，世界上谁也不能使用武力或其他办法改变这个边界。他说，在西德存在着主张修订奥得—尼斯边界的强大势力。他指出，苏联坚决地承认和支持奥得—尼斯边界。
    关于波美经济谈判问题，西伦凯维兹总理说，波兰愿意同包括美国在内的一切国家建立正常的经济关系，这种关系并不排斥贸易或投资信贷，当然不得附加任何政治条件。西伦凯维兹指出波印两国的友谊。关于同印度的经济合作问题，他说，波兰准备尽量广泛地发展这种关系。
