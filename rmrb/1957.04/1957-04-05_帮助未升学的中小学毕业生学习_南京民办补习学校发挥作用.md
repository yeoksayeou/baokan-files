    Helping Unenrolled Primary and Secondary School Graduates Study
    Private Tutoring Schools in Nanjing Play a Role
    (Our Dispatch) Currently, every district in Nanjing city has private junior high school tutoring classes and schools, enrolling past higher primary and junior high school graduates and young people, residents, and cadres who have not continued their education, appropriately meeting their needs for cultural learning.
    These junior high school tutoring schools are all "self-supporting." Those participating in tutoring pay tuition fees of five to six yuan per semester. Some tutoring schools also酌情 reduce or waive tuition fees for a small number of students from families with very difficult economic circumstances. The teachers in the tutoring schools are mostly unemployed intellectuals. Most of them can teach and grade homework conscientiously and are not afraid of hardship. The schools do not have full-time workers and staff; all school affairs, accounting, and general affairs are handled by the teachers. The teachers' salaries are at most about sixty yuan per month, and those with fewer teaching assignments can also maintain their livelihoods. Some tutoring schools also use the money saved to add desks, stools, and other equipment, expanding the student enrollment capacity. Since its establishment more than three years ago, Jianguo Junior High School Tutoring School has added equipment every year, and now it can accommodate more than 700 students studying (in three shifts). Mochou Road Junior High School Tutoring School also saves part of its money each year as a public accumulation fund, and now has a public accumulation fund of more than 600 yuan.
    Students who participate in tutoring generally study more diligently. After tutoring, some are admitted to junior high school or high school, secondary technical schools, and some are promoted in the junior high school tutoring schools and continue their studies.

    帮助未升学的中小学毕业生学习
    南京民办补习学校发挥作用
    本报讯　目前，南京城内每一个区都设有民办初中补习班、校，吸收往届没有升学的高小、初中毕业生和社会青年、居民、干部入学，适当满足他们学习文化的要求。
    这些初中补习学校都是“以生养校”。参加补习的，每人每学期交五元至六元学费。有的补习学校对少数家庭经济很困难的学生，还酌情减免学费。补习学校的教师绝大多数是失业知识分子。他们大部分能认真上课和批改作业，并且不怕艰苦。各校没有专职的工人和职员，学校一切教务、会计、总务等工作，都由教师分担。教师的工资最多的每月六十元左右，任课少的也可以维持生活。有些补习学校还把节余的钱添置课桌、凳子等设备，扩大学生收容量。建国初中补习学校开办三年多以来，每年添置设备，到现在已能容纳七百多人学习（三班制）。莫愁路初中补习学校每年还节余部分钱作公积金，现在有公积金六百多元。
    参加补习的学生，一般学习比较认真，经过补习后，有的考入初中或高中、中等技术学校，有的在初中补习学校升了级，继续学习。
