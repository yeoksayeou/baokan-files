Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 5th: According to a report from Trivandrum by the Indian Press Trust: India's first Communist-led state government was formally established in Kerala today. Chief Minister Namboodiripad and his ten cabinet members were sworn in this afternoon, presided over by Governor Rao. After being sworn in, Namboodiripad issued a statement saying that his government would "first take steps to build a prosperous new Kerala."

He also said that his government would make efforts to fully realize the program put forward in the Communist Party's election manifesto. At the same time, since this government must exercise its powers within the limits of the Indian Constitution, he was unwilling to give people inappropriate expectations about the government's ability to immediately implement the election manifesto.

He said: "Governing this state, known as the 'State of Many Disputes,' is not an easy task for anyone. Moreover, most of us also lack experience in administrative affairs. We must also work within the existing system, and there are some regulations and procedures in this system that we do not like."

In his policy statement, Namboodiripad pointed out that among the measures planned by the new state government are thorough land reform and the nationalization of some private enterprises in the state.

He said that the state's land problem is "quite complex" and therefore requires consultation with other parties and people from all walks of life.

He also explained the sixteen-point program for developing this state with special conditions, which are caused by high population density, severe unemployment, and the general backwardness of industrial and agricultural development. He said that this program will be formulated after consultation with other party leaders and experts, and then submitted to the National Planning Commission for inclusion in the Second Five-Year Plan.

    印共领导的喀拉拉邦政府宣誓就职
    南布迪里巴德表示将在宪法限度内行使职权
    新华社新德里5日电　据印度报业托辣斯自特里凡得琅报道：印度第一个共产党领导的邦政府今天在喀拉拉邦正式诞生。首席部长南布迪里巴德和他的十位阁员于今天午后不久在邦长拉奥的主持下宣誓就职。南布迪里巴德在就职以后发表声明说，他的政府将要“首先采取步骤，建设繁荣的新喀拉拉”。
    他又说，他的政府将要进行努力，充分地实现共产党竞选宣言中所提出的纲领。同时，由于这个政府必须在印度的宪法的限度内行使职权，因此，他不愿意使人们对于这个政府立即实现竞选宣言的能力抱有不适当的期望。
    他说：“治理这一个号称‘多争之邦’的邦，对于任何人说来都不是一件容易的事，不但如此，我们大多数人也是在行政事务方面比较缺乏经验的。我们也必须在现有制度的范围内进行工作，而这种制度中有一些规定和程序是我们所不喜欢的。”
    南布迪里巴德在他的政策声明中指出，在新的邦政府计划采取的措施当中，有进行彻底的土地改革和把邦内一些私人企业收归国有等。
    他说，邦的土地问题是“相当复杂的”，因此需要同其他党派和各阶层人民磋商。
    他还说明了发展这个具有特殊条件的邦的十六点纲领，这些特殊条件是由于人口密度高、失业情况严重、工农业发展普遍落后而产生的。他说，这个纲领将经过同其他政党领袖和专家们磋商后拟订，然后提交国家计划委员会编入第二个五年计划。
