    Old Wharf
    By our reporter Ji Yin
   Sweat streamed down Chen Damao's face like tiny rivulets, soaking his single layer of clothing. His legs were numb and devoid of feeling. His back and shoulders felt like countless insects were stinging, biting, and drilling into him, the aching pain almost unbearable.

    "I can't drop it! I absolutely can't drop it! Someone will come soon, just endure a little longer," Chen Damao told himself, gritting his teeth. He continued to brace himself with the last of his strength, his back arched like a piece of wood leaning against the warehouse wall, trying desperately not to fall.

    Strapped to Chen Damao's back was a crate containing over two hundred pounds of precision machinery. He had just carried it from a ship at the Shiliupu wharf to the Xin Kaihe warehouse. Chen Damao looked around. He had no choice but to continue carrying the heavy crate, waiting for someone to help him unload it. He couldn't be like some people, who shrugged their shoulders lightly and let the goods crash to the ground, thinking only of relieving the burden on their shoulders, unconcerned with the damage to the machinery inside the crate. In the seven or eight years since liberation, Chen Damao had never had a single incident of cargo damage at the Shiliupu wharf. How could he allow a crate of valuable machinery to be damaged in his hands today?

    More than twenty minutes had passed. The sounds of a bustling crowd on the wharf drifted in from the doorway, but no one came inside. The wooden crate on his back felt heavier and heavier, Chen Damao's ears were ringing, and his vision was blurring, flashing with golden stars. Was he really going to fall to the ground with the machine? No! Absolutely not! Even if I die, I have to hold on to the machine and not let it get damaged in the slightest. Thinking of this, Chen Damao shifted the wooden crate on his back a little higher and gripped it even tighter.

    "Help! Someone come and help!" Chen Damao continued to shout towards the door with all his strength.

    A figure flashed in the doorway, and Zhou Alan, a fellow dockworker from Chen Damao's team, walked in. Zhou Alan was shocked to see Chen Damao leaning against the wall, his face ashen. He rushed over to take the heavy crate. Chen Damao, who had been gripping the wooden crate tightly with both hands, immediately let go, and with a "thud" sat down on the ground. Zhou Alan quickly helped him up and saw two bloody marks imprinted on Chen Damao's limp hands.

    That evening, exhausted, Chen Damao took a ferry across the Huangpu River back to his home in Lujiadu on the opposite bank. He stood by the side of the boat, gazing thoughtfully at the Huangpu River, recalling the scene at the Xin Kaihe warehouse earlier that day. He felt relieved that he had persevered and not allowed the machine to be damaged. However, a sense of foreboding welled up in his heart. Twenty years ago, this two-hundred-pound crate would have been nothing. Was he really getting old? Was it really time to leave the wharf? His mood became heavy.

    It was indeed hard to imagine Chen Damao leaving the wharf. He had grown up drinking the water of the Huangpu River. Starting at the age of seven, he had followed his father around the Lujiadu area, gathering firewood and doing odd jobs, eventually becoming a dockworker at the Taigu Wharf. The wharf along the Huangpu River was his home, and he felt like an indispensable part of the wharf. He and the wharf were as inseparable as the Huangpu River and its banks. He knew the wharf as well as he knew his own hands, which had been worn as rough as stones. Taigu Wharf, Shiliupu Wharf, Dada Wharf... which wharf along the Huangpu River hadn't felt his sweat and bore his footprints!

    Chen Damao had once truly wanted to leave the wharf and find another way to make a living. That was when the Japanese invading army occupied Shanghai. He worked like an ox day and night at the Taigu Wharf. If he worked even a little slower, the Japanese supervisor's whip would "whoosh" down on him. He ate only cornmeal, a thin watery gruel that wasn't enough to satisfy his hunger. The strong Chen Damao fell ill with malaria. He was sick for three months, and without any income, the whole family was in dire straits. The children cried, and his wife cried too. Eventually, friends from the wharf helped him out, and they didn't starve to death. It was then, lying in his sickbed, that Chen Damao first resolved to leave the wharf: "I'll leave, I'll definitely leave. I'd rather die than eat this starving man's rice on the wharf!" After recovering from his illness, Chen Damao, supporting his weakened body, reappeared at the wharf. He didn't leave, not because he was attached to the wharf, but because he needed to live. Where else could he go?

    Last year, Chen Damao had also brought up the idea of leaving the wharf and doing other work in the team. But that wasn't voluntary. It was brought up in a very conflicted mood. It turned out that the loading and unloading teams at the wharf used piecework wages, with the team as the unit. Chen Damao felt that his physical strength was no longer as good as the young people's, and if he stayed in the team, it would affect the income of others. When he painfully voiced this request, all the dozen or so workers in the team jumped up in a panic, chattering all at once:

    "Damao, you can't leave!"
    "Damao, don't say that!"
    "Without you, we can't work!"
    "Damao..."

    The enthusiasm of these young people made Chen Damao unsure whether to laugh or cry. He was so moved that he couldn't say a word and could only nod repeatedly. In fact, he didn't really want to leave the wharf! From then on, he never mentioned leaving the wharf again. He continued to stay in the tenth group of the fourth loading and unloading area of the Shanghai Port Authority.

    "They won't let me go. They still need me to work at the wharf, I can still do it." When Chen Damao recalled these scenes on the ferry home, he comforted himself in this way.

    "Woo, woo—" The ferry's horn sounded, and the boat arrived at Lujiadu. Chen Damao followed the crowd ashore. As he stepped onto the high, final step of the embankment, a sharp pain shot through his waist. The injury from the day hadn't fully healed. The next day happened to be the tenth group's day off. Early in the morning, Chen Damao came to Lujiadu again, boarded the ferry, and sailed towards the west bank.

    It was still quite early, and the Huangpu River was shrouded in mist. It was impossible to see the ships on the opposite side, and the ferry sounded its horn continuously. Chen Damao gazed at the morning scenery on both sides of the Huangpu River, the cool river breeze blowing on his thin, wrinkled face, making him feel indescribably comfortable. Over the past few years, he had unconsciously developed a habit: every day off, he had to cross the river and go to the wharf to take a look and spend a day or half a day there. This was the greatest pleasure of his week. No matter if it was windy or rainy, he had never missed it once. This morning, he didn't want to come out because he was still in pain, but after lying in bed for a while, he became restless. Was he just going to lie there all day? The "woo-woo" sound of the ferry calling at the dock in the distance seemed to be calling him. Chen Damao jumped out of bed and rushed to the dock, just in time to catch this ferry.

    As soon as Chen Damao landed, he went to the team's tool room. This was usually his first activity on his day off: he moved all the ropes, carrying poles, straw bags, and other handling tools outside. He put the damp ropes on the railing to dry, and if he found any broken ones, he would twist a new strand to splice it. He wiped the dirty carrying poles clean. When he saw something that was really too dirty, he would mutter angrily as he tidied up. Chen Damao had some opinions about some of the young workers at the wharf. They didn't cherish the tools enough. When it was time to get off work, they were in a hurry to go to the movies, and the ropes and carrying poles would be thrown all over the ground. He would get anxious when he saw this and had to follow behind them, picking them up one by one. People at the wharf quickly left, leaving only Chen Damao alone. He couldn't leave. He had to collect all the equipment on the ground and put it away properly. Although this wasn't his job, Chen Damao felt that it was something he should do. Every summer, why did so many people in other teams get boils on their shoulders and absenteeism increased, while no one in Chen Damao's team got sores? This was also simply the result of Chen Damao's attention to the preservation of carrying poles. He didn't let the carrying poles bake in the sun, but covered them tightly with straw bags, so they wouldn't burn their shoulders when they were taken out for use.

    Chen Damao moved out a large pile of reed mats and burlap sacks from the tool room. He had collected them from all over the wharf a few days ago, but they hadn't been aired and were still damp. He spread them out on the wharf one by one to dry in the sun. Seeing these things, he often remembered an old story. It was more than ten years ago when Chen Damao was working at the Taigu Wharf. One rainy day, he was carrying a bag of sugar weighing over two hundred pounds, walking onto the wharf on a long springboard. The springboard was slippery, as if coated with a layer of oil. He lost his footing and fell onto the springboard with the sugar, hitting his forehead. When the supervisor saw it, he cursed. Chen Damao had to endure the pain, get up, grab a handful of the scattered white sugar and smear it on the wound, and continue to carry the broken bag of sugar, staggering, to the warehouse. At that moment, how good it would have been if there were a few dry reed mats and burlap sacks spread on the springboard. Therefore, now whenever it rained, Chen Damao would be busy without stopping, carrying out handfuls of reed mats that he usually stored, and spreading them from the springboard by the wharf all the way to the warehouse door. He wouldn't let anyone work until he had laid them all out.

    For a while, some people at the wharf were enthusiastically talking about mechanization, eyeing the large cranes at other wharves, hoping and waiting day and night, and didn't want to use levers and ropes anymore. This made Chen Damao very angry.

    "Damao, don't be so conservative, you have to look further ahead," some young people advised him. "Our wharf will eventually be fully mechanized. Can we keep relying on these sticks and ropes to make a living? Look at the wharves near us, machines are already becoming more and more numerous. We're practicing socialism, can we keep using these backward tools to work?"

    The good-tempered old dockworker suddenly became angry when he heard these words. People had never seen him get so angry.

    "Conservative! Backward! Those are big labels. Does socialism not need these levers and ropes? I think we'll still need them in ten or twenty years," he said angrily. "Socialism has to do the calculations carefully. Mechanize when we should, but we still have to use levers when we need to."

    Really, how can these levers and ropes be thrown away completely? Chen Damao looked at the large area of neat, clean tools piled up in front of him, and the more he thought about it, the more he felt that what he said made sense. It wasn't that he didn't love machines. On the contrary, he loved machines to the point of being obsessed. After the timber conveyor was installed at the Shiliupu Wharf, he didn't know how many times he had gone to see it. But he felt that our country was still poor and couldn't reach the sky in one step. We still had to use levers and ropes when we needed to. Moreover, levers also had advantages that machines couldn't replace. Chen Damao had grown up in poverty and couldn't bear to throw away good things casually.

    The things in the tool room had all been moved out and arranged properly. Chen Damao found a place to rest and watch over them, like a shepherd watching over his flock. At this moment, the sun had already risen, and the Huangpu River was warm. His eyes gradually became blurred, and soon he fell asleep on the chair like a child, snoring and drooling from the corner of his mouth, sleeping so sweetly. Three Now, people are used to taking their wives and children to the movies and parks on their days off, but Chen Damao didn't like these things. When he woke up, he tidied up his things and went to the cheap food stall for a meal. After that, he wandered around the wharf, walking from Dada Wharf to Shiliupu, and from Shiliupu to the Bund. How interesting it was to walk on this wide, flat wharf and look at the scenery. Over the years, he had watched the Huangpu River prospering day by day, and the wharf had become more and more beautiful. Take the Shiliupu Wharf, for example. Originally, it was just a large mud slope. When the Huangpu River rose, the river water would flood to the warehouse door, with mud everywhere. Now, it had been built into a wide cement wharf, and timber conveyors, like long dragons, extended from the wharf to the warehouse, "clattering" bags of rice into the warehouse. He looked at this and looked at that, and it was really fun.

    The reason why Chen Damao felt that wandering around the wharf was better than going to the park was that he had another plan: here, he could always help with something. When he saw where the soybeans and rice bags were broken, he would go and tie them up. He would find a broom and sweep up the rice that had been spilled on the ground. Last summer, he swept and swept like this and swept up more than two hundred pounds of rice for the public. Even the scraps of cloth that fell on the wharf were useful to him. A few days ago, he used a pile of small red cloth strips he had picked up to tie a mark on the tail of each rope in his team, so that these ropes wouldn't be taken by others by mistake.

    Yesterday, he heard that a "temporary dormitory for night shift workers" had been set up at the wharf, and now he decided to go and take a look. The temporary dormitory was in an alleyway, converted from a warehouse. Upstairs and downstairs, neatly arranged were one hundred and several dozen beds, each with new sheets and new quilts. He had never slept on such a bed, even when he got married, let alone working the night shift. When Chen Damao was young, he didn't know how many night shifts he had worked at the wharf. After finishing work at night, he would grab a handful of grass and crawl under a bridge or into a dark corner of the road. Sometimes, he would be awakened by the rain; sometimes, he would be awakened by the tips of the patrolman's leather shoes. What kind of life are the dockworkers of today living? Look at these young people, hugging new quilts, sleeping so soundly. Thinking of these things, Chen Damao always felt warm in his heart.

    The sky was near dusk, and another day off had ended. Chen Damao, with a satisfied heart, stepped off the ferry and returned to Lujiadu on the east bank. At this moment, thousands of lights had already been lit on both sides of the Huangpu River, and in the dim light, the rumbling noise of the wharves on both sides could be heard.

    To Chen Damao, this wasn't the rumbling of machines being transported at the wharf; this was the most moving music in the world.

    老码头
    本报记者　季音
   一汗像小水流似的从陈大毛的脸上不断地淌下来，把他的单衣浸得稀湿一片。他的腿早已麻木得失去了知觉。他的腰部，肩部，都像有无数条虫子在刺，在咬，在钻，酸疼得简直没法忍受。
    “不能丢！千万不能丢！再忍耐一下就会有人来的。”陈大毛咬着牙根，一再鼓励着自己。他继续撑着他最后的一股劲，弓着腰，就像一段木头似的靠在仓库的墙边上，竭力不让自己倒下来。
    背在陈大毛身上的是一箱重有二百多斤的精密机器，他是才从十六铺码头边的一条船上，背到新开河仓库里来的。陈大毛向四周围看了一下，没有办法，只好把沉重的箱子继续抬着，等别人来帮他卸下，他可不能像有些人那样，肩膀轻松地一耸，就把货物摔在地上，这样，肩膀是舒服了，可是箱子里的机器却会受不了。解放后的七、八年来，陈大毛在十六铺码头上，从来也没有发生过一件货损事故，今天他怎么能让一箱贵重的机器在他的手里遭到损坏。
    已经二十多分钟过去了。从门口传来了码头上的一片喧嚷声，却始终不见有一个人走进来。背上的木箱已愈来愈沉重，陈大毛的耳朵里嗡嗡响，眼前金花乱飞，一阵阵地发黑。难道真要连人带机器一起摔倒地上了吗？不能！绝对不能！我死也得把机器抱住，不让它碰伤一丁点儿。想到这里，陈大毛把背上的木箱又往上移了移，手也抓得更紧。
    “快来人呀，快来人帮忙呀！”陈大毛继续用最大的力气，向门外嘶喊。
    门口人影一闪，走进来一个人，正是和陈大毛同组的码头工人周阿兰。周阿兰发现了支靠在墙边上脸如土色的陈大毛，不觉吃了一惊，赶紧飞奔过来，接下了沉重的木箱。两手一直紧紧抓着木箱的陈大毛，此刻手一松，“咕咚”一声，坐倒在地上了。周阿兰连忙把他扶起来，他看见陈大毛那两只软软地垂挂下来的手上，印着两道血痕。
    当天傍晚，疲惫不堪的陈大毛坐着黄浦江上的轮渡，回到对岸的陆家渡家里去。他站在船边上，出神地望着黄浦江，想起今天白天新开河仓库里的一幕，他心头感到宽慰，自己总算撑下来了，没有让机器给震坏。但是，也有一阵悲哀的预感涌上了他的心头。要是在二十年前，这二百多斤的木箱又算得了什么。难道是真的衰老了么？难道真是到了离开码头的时候了么？他的心情不觉沉重起来。
    要陈大毛离开码头，这确实是难以想像的事情。他是喝着这黄浦江上的水长大的。打从七岁开始，他就在这陆家渡一带，跟着父亲转呀转的，拾柴火，做苦工，以后就成了太沽码头上的一名码头工人。这黄浦江边的码头就是他的家，而他觉得自己也是码头上不可缺少的一部分。他和码头，正如这黄浦江水和江岸那样不可分离。他熟悉码头，如同熟悉他那双被磨得像石头一样粗粝的手。太沽码头，十六铺码头，大达码头……，黄浦江边的那一个码头上，没有流过他的汗，印过他的足迹！
    陈大毛也曾经有一度真正想离开码头，另找生路。那是日本侵略军占领上海的时候，他在太沽码头上做工。他像牛一样的不分昼夜地工作着，做得慢一些，日本监工的鞭子就“嗖嗖”地飞落在身上。他吃的却是玉米面，稀汤汤地，喝也喝不饱。强壮的陈大毛病倒了，害的是疟疾，一病就是三个月，收入全无，全家的嘴都挂了起来，孩子哭，老婆也哭，后来总算码头上的朋友接济了他一些，才没有给饿死。就在那时候，睡在病床上的陈大毛第一次下了离开码头的决心：“走吧，决计走吧，死也不再吃这碗码头上的饿煞饭！”病好以后，陈大毛支撑着衰弱的身体，又出现在码头上，他没有走，不是为了留恋码头，而是为了生活。他走到那儿去好呢？
    去年，陈大毛也曾经有一次在小组里提出，要离开码头，改干别的活。但那不是出于自愿，而是在一种极其矛盾的心情中才提出来的。原来，码头上的装卸小组是以组为单位，实行计件工资的，陈大毛感到自己的体力已不如青年人，继续留在组里，就会影响别人的收入。当他痛苦地道出了自己的这个要求以后，全组十多个工人都急得蹦了起来，七嘴八舌地嚷成了一片：
    “大毛，你要走可不成！”
    “大毛，你别说这话啦！”
    “没有你，我们就玩不起来了。”
    “大毛……”
    你看这十几个青年人的那股子热情，真叫陈大毛笑也不是，哭也不是，感动得满肚子的话没法说，只好连连地点头。其实，他何尝真想离开码头！就打这回起，再也不见他提起要离开码头的事，他继续在上海港务局第四装卸区的第十组里留了下来。
    “他们不会放我走的，码头上的活儿还少不了我，我还能做。”当陈大毛在回家的轮渡上回忆起这些情景的时候，这样安慰着自己。
    “呜，呜——”轮渡汽笛长鸣，船已到达陆家渡口。陈大毛跟着人群一起上了岸，当他跨上了那高高的最后一级坡沿，腰边一阵酸痛，白天的创伤还没有完全好呢。二第二天，恰好是第十小组的工休日。陈大毛一早又来到了陆家渡口，搭上轮渡，向西岸驶去。
    天色还相当早，黄浦江上雾气腾腾，对面看不清行船，轮渡不停地拉着汽笛。陈大毛眺望着黄浦江两岸的清晨景色，含着凉意的江风吹着他瘦削多皱的脸，浑身真有说不出的舒畅。这几年来，他已经不知不觉地养成了这样一种习惯：每个工休天，他一定要渡过江来，到码头上去看一看，消磨掉一天或者半天的时间。这是他一星期中最大的享受。无论刮风下雨，他从没有间断过一次。今天早晨，他因为身上还隐隐作痛，本来不想出来了，可是在床上稍稍躺了一会，就烦躁起来，难道一天就这样躺着过去吗？远处传来了渡口上轮渡“呜呜”的叫唤声，好像就在喊叫着他。陈大毛一骨碌从床上爬起来，赶到渡口，正好给他赶上了这班轮渡。
    陈大毛一登岸，就来到了本组的工具房。这照例是他工休日的第一个活动项目：他把所有的绳子、扛棒、草包等搬运工具统统搬到外面。潮湿的绳子拿到栏干上晒着，发现有断裂的，就搓一根给它接上。脏污的扛棒，都擦拭干净。看到实在脏得不像样的，他就会一边整理，一边生气地嘟哝起来。陈大毛对于码头上的一些青年工人是有意见的，他们太不爱惜工具了，一到下班的时候，急着去看电影，绳子、扛棒就“辟里拍啦”地丢一地。他一见这种情形就着急，只好跟在他们背后，一根根地拾。码头上的人很快就走光了，只留下陈大毛一个人，他不能走，他得把满地的器具收集起来，安置停当。虽然这并不是他的分内事，但是陈大毛觉得，这一切是应当由他来做的。每到夏天，为什么别的组里好些人肩膀上都长了疖子，缺勤增加，独有陈大毛这个组里没人长疮呢？这也无非是陈大毛在平时注意保管扛棒的结果，他不让扛棒在太阳里晒着，用草袋把它们遮盖得严严实实，拿去用时就不会烫伤肩膀了。
    陈大毛从工具房里又搬出了一大堆蒲包和麻袋，这是他前几天才从码头各处收拾拢来的，还没有晒过，有些潮湿。他把它一只只地摊开晒在码头上。看到这些东西，他常常想起一件往事。那是十几年前了，陈大毛在太沽码头做工，一个下雨天，他背着一包二百多斤重的糖，踏着一条条长长的跳板走上码头，跳板上滑溜溜的，就像涂着一层油。他一个失足，就连人带糖扑倒在跳板上，额上撞破了一大块。监工的一发现，就大骂起来，他只好忍痛爬起，抓了把散开的白糖往伤口上一抹，继续背起那包已经掼破了的糖包，踉踉跄跄地送到仓库。那时刻，如果跳板上有几只干蒲包和麻袋铺着，该有多好呵。所以，现在凡是遇到下雨天，陈大毛就忙个不歇，一捧捧地抱出了他平时存放着的蒲包，从码头边的跳板一直到仓库门口，没有铺好，他决不让人工作。
    有一阵子，码头上有些人尽是热心地谈论着机械化，眼睛瞅着别个码头上的大起重机，日也盼，夜也盼，都不想再用杠棒和绳子。这很使陈大毛生气。
    “大毛，别太保守啦，眼睛得看得远一些。”一些青年人劝导他说，“我们码头上迟早总要实行全部机械化的，还能老是靠这些棒棒绳绳吃饭么？你看我们附近几个码头上，机器不是已经愈来愈多了吗。实行社会主义么，还能老用这些落后工具来干活？……”
    这位好脾气的老码头工人，一听这些话，突然生起气来。人们从来没有见他发过这样大的火。
    “保守！落后！帽子可不小，难道社会主义就不要这些杠棒绳子了？我看再过十年、二十年还少不了它们。”他气虎虎地说，“社会主义也得算算细账，该机械化就机械化，该用扛棒还得用扛棒。”
    真的，这些扛棒、绳子怎么能全丢呢？陈大毛看看堆在他面前的一大片整齐、干净的工具，愈想愈觉得自己的话有道理。他不是不爱机器，相反，他爱机器爱得入迷，木条运输机在十六铺码头装上以后，他不知去看了多少次。但他觉得，我们的国家还穷，不能一步登天，扛棒绳子该用还得用；况且，扛棒也有机器所不能代替的妙处。陈大毛是过着穷苦日子长大的，要他把好好的东西随便丢掉，可办不到。
    工具房的东西已经全部搬出来安置停当，陈大毛就找一个地方歇下来，看守着，就像一个牧羊人看守着他的羊群。此刻，太阳早已升起，黄浦江边已经变得暖烘烘的。他的眼睛渐渐朦胧起来，不消一会，就像小孩子似地歪在椅子上睡着了，鼻子里打着呼噜，嘴角边流着口涎，睡得可真香甜。 三现时人们在休息天，都时兴带着妻小看电影，逛公园，但陈大毛却不爱这些。他一觉醒来，收拾好东西，就赶到经济饭摊上吃了一顿饭，之后，就在码头上四处转游，从大达码头走到十六铺，从十六铺走到外滩边上。在这宽畅平坦的码头上走走，看看景致，该多有意思。这些年来，他眼看着黄浦江上一天兴旺一天，码头也修得越来越漂亮。就说这十六铺码头，原先不过是一大块泥坡，黄浦江一涨潮，江水就涌到仓库门口，到处一片稀泥。如今，这里已经修成一个宽阔的水泥码头，木条运输机像一条条的长龙，从码头边一直伸向仓库，“拍拉拍拉”地把一包包的米袋翻进仓库。他看看这，望望那，真是乐趣无穷。
    陈大毛所以觉得在码头上转游比逛公园强，他还有另一个打算：在这里，他可以随时帮着做些什么。他看到哪里的黄豆、大米口袋破裂着，就走去把它扎好；找一把扫帚，把撒在地上的米扫起来。去年夏天，他这么打打扫扫的，还给公家扫了二百多斤米呢。就连掉在码头上的那些碎布条，他也有用处。前些天，他用拾来的一堆小红布条，在他们组的每根绳子的尾巴上扎了一个记号，免得这些绳子再被别人拿错了。
    昨天听说码头上又添设了一个“夜班工人临时宿舍”，此刻，他决定走去看一看。临时宿舍在一条弄堂口，是用一个仓库改的，楼上楼下，整齐地排列着一百几十个床位，床床都是一式的新单子，新棉被。这种床，他连结婚时也没有睡过，不要说做夜班。陈大毛年轻的时候，在码头上不知道曾做过多少夜工，夜里工作完，就抱着一把草，往桥洞底下、马路暗角里一钻。有时候，大雨把他淋醒；有时候，巡捕的皮鞋尖把他踢醒……。今天的码头工人，过的是什么样的生活呵，你看这些青年人，抱着新被子，呼呼地睡得多香甜。想到这些，陈大毛不知怎的，心里总是热呼呼的。
    天色已近黄昏，又一个工休日结束了。陈大毛怀着满足的心情跨下轮渡，返回东岸的陆家渡去。此刻，万千盏电灯已在黄浦江两岸亮了起来，影影绰绰的灯光里，传来了两岸码头上轰轰隆隆的喧嚣声。
    在陈大毛听来，这不是码头上运输机器的轰鸣，这是一曲世界上最动人心弦的音乐。
