    My Fiancé and I
    Jin Yuan
    After reading the People's Daily editorial of April 8th entitled "On the Question of Middle and Primary School Graduates Participating in Agricultural Production," I was very moved. To be honest, when I first read it, I felt somewhat dissatisfied and pessimistic, a little nervous, and felt that some parts of the editorial were "over the top," not considering the youth at all, and overly critical. However, after reading it repeatedly four or five times, I gradually felt that the editorial was well-reasoned, every sentence made sense, and it made a sharp criticism of the unhealthy things in my thinking. I felt that my thinking was wrong, and the Party newspaper was completely right. I should correct my wrong thinking.
    I am a female salesclerk in a store in Shenyang, and I am only nineteen years old this year. I graduated from elementary school in 1955. Because I failed to get into middle school, I went to work. At that time, my mood was very bad. I complained that the entrance exam questions were too difficult and that the government was running too few middle schools. But I still had a beautiful idea: if I couldn't pass the exam, so be it; after starting work, with a little income, I could support my fiancé to study.
    My fiancé is studying in junior high school and will graduate this summer. I originally wanted to support him to go to university, so that he could participate in the great construction of the motherland after graduation. I never thought of him going to the countryside to farm.
    My fiancé's grades are very good, all A's and B's. He and I had discussed it long ago. He often said to me: "I must study hard and become an engineer in the future. After we get married, the two of us will live in a city, take a walk after work, and watch movies and dramas. How happy that will be!" I also told him: "You can study with peace of mind. Don't think that I don't earn much, supporting you with 20 yuan a month is no problem." From then on, he studied even harder. I also often wrote to encourage him. In short, I put all my hopes and future happiness on him.
    Some time ago, I wrote to him, asking him to review his lessons well and prepare for further studies. His letter said that this year the schools are enrolling fewer students, and it is not as easy to get into school as it used to be, so he is anxious and worried, and can't even eat, but he is still desperately reviewing his lessons, and as a result, he has fallen ill from exhaustion.
    After reading the editorial repeatedly, I felt how wrong my past thoughts were! The more I thought about it, the more ashamed I felt. The editorial pointed out the root of my illness. I have already told my fiancé about the changes in my thinking, and told him that if he fails to get into school, he should return to his hometown to engage in production. Whether he participates in agricultural production or goes to school, I will always love him. I love him not for fame, status, money, or enjoyment.
    Now I have received his reply. He said that he was also very happy after reading the editorial, and believed that what the Party said was correct. He also wrote to the agricultural cooperative in his hometown, saying that the cooperative would soon have a new member.
    I am a member of the Communist Youth League, and I firmly listen to the Party, and I hope that those who have similar wrong ideas to my past will also correct these incorrect ideas.

    我同我的未婚夫
    金原
    读了人民日报4月8日题为“关于中小学毕业生参加农业生产问题”的社论以后，我很感动。说句实话，当我第一遍读完的时候，我感到有些不满和悲观，心情有些紧张，并且感到社论有的地方说的“过火了”，一点不为青年着想，过分地加以指责了。可是，当我反复地读了四五遍之后，逐渐感到社论说的头头是道，句句有理，对我的思想上不健康的东西作了尖刻的批评。我觉得我的想法错了，党报说的完全对。我应当纠正我的错误思想。
    我是沈阳一个商店的女售货员，今年才十九岁。我是1955年在小学毕业的。没有考上中学，我就参加工作了。当时我的心绪很坏，埋怨招生考试试题太难，埋怨政府办中学太少。可是我还有一个美丽的想法：自己考不上就算了，参加工作以后，有点儿收入了，我可以供给我的未婚夫去读书。
    我的未婚夫在初中念书，今年暑期毕业。我原先想供给他上大学，让他毕业后来参加祖国的伟大建设，根本就没有想到要他到农村去种地。
    我的未婚夫的学习成绩很好，都是五分、四分。我和他早就商量好了。他常对我说：“我一定好好念书，将来出来作个工程师，我们结婚后，两个人生活在一个城市里，下班后散散步、看看电影和戏剧，是多么幸福啊！”我也告诉他：“你尽管安心念书，别看我挣的钱不多，每月供你二十元还不成问题。”他从此更加努力读书。我也常去信鼓励他。总之，我把我的希望，将来的幸福都寄托在他的身上。
    前些日子，我给他去信，要他好好复习功课，准备升学。他的来信说，今年学校招生少，升学不像过去那么容易，他因此着急上火，连饭也吃不下，但他还整天拚命复习功课，结果累病了。
    我反复地看了社论之后，感到我过去的想法是多么错误啊！越想我越觉得惭愧。社论指出了我的病根。我已经把我的思想变化告诉了我的未婚夫，并且告诉他，如果升不上学就回乡生产。不管他是参加农业生产或是升学我始终爱他。爱他并不是为了名誉地位、金钱和享受。
    现在我已经接到他的回信。他说他看了社论以后也很高兴，认为党的话是正确的。他并且给家乡的农业社去了信，说不久社内会增加一名新社员。
    我是一个青年团员，我坚决听党的话，并希望那些有类似我过去的那些错误想法的人，也纠正这种不正确的想法。
