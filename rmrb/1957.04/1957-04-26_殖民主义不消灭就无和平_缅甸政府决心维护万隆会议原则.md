Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, April 25th: The Burmese government reaffirmed on April 24th that it is "solemnly committed to the purposes and principles proclaimed at the Bandung Conference."

In a communique issued on the second anniversary of the Bandung Conference, the Burmese government said that many things that have happened in the past two years have proven that the hopes of those who attended the conference were justified. Morocco, Tunisia, Sudan and Ghana have gained freedom. Other dependent countries are moving towards independence.

The communique pointed out, "An attempt to resolve the issue of Egypt, which directly affects one of the participants in the Bandung Conference, in a way that violates the spirit of Bandung, has ended in failure."

The communique said that the Burmese government believes that "there can be no true peace and happiness in this world until 'colonialism in all its manifestations' is eliminated."

    殖民主义不消灭就无和平
    缅甸政府决心维护万隆会议原则
    新华社仰光25日电　缅甸政府4月24日重申，它“庄严地致力于万隆会议宣布的目的和原则”。
    缅甸政府在万隆会议两周年的时候发表的公报说，过去两年中发生的许多事情证明参加会议的人的希望是正当的。摩洛哥、突尼斯、苏丹和加纳已经获得自由。其它附属国家正在朝着独立前进。
    公报指出，“一种想用违背万隆精神的方法来解决直接影响万隆会议的参加者之一埃及的问题的尝试，已经以失败而告终。”
    公报说，缅甸政府认为，“‘殖民主义在其一切表现中’被消灭以前，这个世界是不能有真正的和平和幸福的。”
