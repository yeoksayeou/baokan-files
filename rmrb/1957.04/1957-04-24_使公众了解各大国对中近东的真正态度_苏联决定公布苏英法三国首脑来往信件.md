Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 23rd: Ilichev, Director of the Information Department of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said that in order to make the world public more clearly understand the true attitude of major powers towards the Middle East issue, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes it is necessary to publish the contents of the correspondence between the heads of government of the Soviet Union, Britain, and France on the eve of the Anglo-French-Israeli aggression against Egypt. From the letters, it can be seen that the Soviet Union not only had no intention of pitting certain countries against each other, but also constantly strived to prevent military conflicts and demanded that disputes be resolved peacefully, taking into account the interests of all countries and fully respecting Egypt's sovereignty and national rights.

Ilichev held a press conference in Moscow on April 22nd. He told the reporters present that the aforementioned letters would be published in the "Izvestia" on April 23rd.

Before announcing this, Ilichev pointed out that the governments of the United States, Britain, and France put forward completely untenable arguments against the Soviet government's proposals on the Middle East issue in February this year, and rejected the new steps taken by the Soviet Union to safeguard peace. Some newspapers, and even some officials, insisted that the Soviet government's policy on the "Suez Crisis" seemed to harbor some "special purpose" in the Middle East, and that the Soviet Union was using the contradictions between Western countries and Arab Eastern countries to achieve this goal. On the one hand, they want to slander the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy, and on the other hand, they want to shirk the responsibility of Western countries for the aggression against Egypt, while making the Western countries' imperialist policy towards the Arab East appear more attractive.

Ilichev said that the Soviet government has never had any purpose in the Middle East, past or present, that is incompatible with the national interests of the people of these countries. It only cares about peace and national independence in the region.

Ilichev also answered some questions about the international situation raised by reporters at the press conference.

Referring to the foreign response to the Soviet Union's proposal to permanently or temporarily suspend nuclear weapons testing, Ilichev said that according to the information received, the Soviet proposal has been welcomed by broad sections of society in many countries. At the same time, it must be pointed out that officials in certain Western countries and some newspapers close to officials in the United States and Britain have taken a negative attitude towards the new Soviet proposal. Some people groundlessly insist that modern science and technology has reached such a level that nuclear explosions cannot be detected, and therefore it is said that nuclear explosions cannot be monitored. This is obviously a fabricated reason. The problem lies only in the fact that Western figures have political considerations and aggressive foreign policies, and they are unwilling to give up continuing to expand their armaments.

In answering the question of what impact the European Atomic Energy Community and the "Common Market" agreement will have on the development of the German issue, Ilichev said that there is no doubt that the establishment of the European Atomic Energy Community and the "Common Market" is extremely detrimental to the prospects of unifying Germany into a peace-loving and democratic country, which is of concern to the German people and all Europeans who hope for lasting peace. American and British newspapers do not even intend to hide the fact that the establishment of the European Atomic Energy Community and the "Common Market" will push the German issue deeper into a dead end.

### 使公众了解各大国对中近东的真正态度  苏联决定公布苏英法三国首脑来往信件

    使公众了解各大国对中近东的真正态度
    苏联决定公布苏英法三国首脑来往信件
    新华社莫斯科23日电　苏联外交部新闻司司长伊利切夫说，为了使全世界公众更清楚地了解各大国对中近东问题的真正态度，苏联外交部认为有必要公布苏联、英国和法国三国政府首脑在英法以三国侵略埃及前夕来往信件的内容。从信件中可以看出，苏联不仅没有使某些国家火并的企图，而且还不断地努力防止发生军事冲突，要求在考虑各国的利益和充分尊重埃及的主权和民族权利的情况下和平解决纠纷问题。
    伊利切夫4月22日在莫斯科举行了一个记者招待会。他向到会的各国记者说，上述信件将在4月23日的“消息报”上公布。
    伊利切夫在宣布这件事之前指出，美国、英国、法国三国政府对苏联政府今年2月间关于中近东问题的建议提出了完全不能成立的论据，拒绝了苏联采取的新的维护和平的步骤。有些报纸，甚至有些官方人士硬说苏联政府在“苏伊士危机”问题上实行的政策似乎对中近东抱有某种“特殊的目的”，并且说苏联为了达到这种目的而利用西方国家和阿拉伯东方国家的矛盾。他们一方面想对苏联的和平外交政策进行中伤，另一方面想推卸西方国家对侵略埃及所负的责任，同时使西方国家对阿拉伯东方的帝国主义侵略方针显得比较诱人一些。
    伊利切夫说，苏联政府对中近东过去和现在始终不抱有任何同这些国家人民的民族利益不相容的目的。它只关心这个地区的和平和民族独立。
    伊利切夫在招待会上还回答了记者们提出的一些关于国际局势的问题。
    伊利切夫在谈到外国对于苏联关于永久或是暂时停止核武器试验的建议的反应时说，根据已经得到的消息可以判断，苏联的建议受到许多国家广大的社会人士的欢迎。同时不能不指出，某些西方国家的官方人士和美英两国接近官方人士的某些报纸对苏联的新建议采取否定态度。有人毫无根据地硬说，现代科学技术已达到了这样一种水平，可以使核爆炸不被人发觉，因此说对核爆炸无法进行监督。这显然是臆想出来的理由。问题只在于西方国家人士有着政治上的考虑和侵略性的外交方针，他们不愿意放弃继续扩充军备。
    伊利切夫在回答欧洲原子能联营组织和“共同市场”协定对德国问题的发展会有什么影响的问题时说，毫无疑问，建立欧洲原子能联营组织和“共同市场”，对于德国人民和欧洲所有希望持久和平的人所关心的把德国统一成一个爱好和平的和民主的国家的前景，是起着极其有害的作用的。美国和英国的报纸甚至不打算隐瞒，建立欧洲原子能联营组织和“共同市场”会使德国问题更深地陷入死胡同里。
