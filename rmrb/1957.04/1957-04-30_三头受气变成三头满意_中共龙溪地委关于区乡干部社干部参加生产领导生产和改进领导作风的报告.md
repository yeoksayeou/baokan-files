Three Heads of Grievance Transformed into Three Heads of Satisfaction
Report from the Longxi Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on District, Township, and Commune Cadres Participating in Production, Leading Production, and Improving Leadership Style

To the Provincial Committee and all County and City Committees:

Since the implementation of the resolution of the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, universal importance has been attached to conducting ideological education among district and township cadres on hard work, simple living, and sharing weal and woe with the masses. At the three-level cadre meetings held in early February in each county, the work of 1956 was summarized and reviewed in the spirit of rectification, and the bureaucratic, subjectivist, and administrative commandism styles of leadership that were detached from the masses were criticized. It was also decided to launch a democratic rectification and commune consolidation movement in rural areas centered on spring plowing. At the same time, 1,613 cadres (including 178 cadres at the county level and above) were transferred from directly subordinate organizations of the prefecture and counties to go deep into rural areas to strengthen grassroots leadership. As a result, the style of hard work and simple living among district and township cadres has generally been greatly promoted and grown compared to before. The most prominent sign of this period is that cadres took off their shoes, went down to the fields to participate in production, and went deep among the masses to eat, live, and work with them. Comrade Shen Shanshui, Deputy Secretary of the Nan靖 County Party Committee, carried manure with the peasants; Comrade Lin Kezhi, Deputy County Head of Zhao'an County, helped the masses repair water conservancy projects and carried two or thirty loads of soil without rest; Comrade Cai Zhengnan, Deputy Secretary of the Gu County District Committee of Longxi County, and Comrade Zeng Xinghua, Deputy Secretary of the District Communist Youth League Committee, learned from Comrade Jiang Shuihe, Deputy Secretary of the Changli County Party Committee, and took manure baskets to the fields to inspect production. In one day, they clarified the production situation of the commune and collected more than sixty catties of pig and cow manure, setting an example for township and commune cadres and greatly encouraging the masses. Some of the masses said, "These cadres are like the cadres during the land reform." It was even more common for township and commune cadres to go down to the fields, which made the masses very satisfied. Some said, "The cadres have changed their bones," and "This is what it looks like to be the masters of the house." After the party branch secretary and township head of Xibian Township in Nan靖 County returned to the township, they tore up the playing cards that symbolized their detachment from the masses, participated in commune production, and took the lead in jumping into the deepest part of the water to repair water conservancy projects. Many people reflected, "This county meeting is more effective than taking tonics." His family also said, "The government held a good meeting this time, and people have changed." The cadres reflected that they have changed from "three heads of grievance to three heads of satisfaction." According to incomplete statistics from four counties, Nan靖, Longxi, Haicheng, and Hua'an, among the 702 work team cadres who went to the countryside, 495 were able to go deep into the fields and work with the masses, accounting for 70% of the total number of townships. According to statistics from five counties, Changtai, Longxi, Nan靖, Haicheng, and Hua'an, among the 2,243 main cadres of the township (most of whom were full-time), 1,808 were able to truly change their style, take off their shoes and go down to the fields, and lead the masses to engage in production, accounting for 80.6% of the total number.

With the transformation of the cadres' work style, the situation of production slackening and tense relations between cadres and the masses has greatly changed, and a new atmosphere has emerged in rural work.

Improved the enthusiasm of the masses for production

First, driven by the cadres "taking off their shoes and going down to the fields," the enthusiasm of the masses for production has been greatly improved, and the spring plowing production movement has gradually formed a climax. For example, after Lin Kezhi, the Deputy County Head of Zhao'an County mentioned above, participated in the repair of the reservoir at the Dakengtang Reservoir, the number of migrant workers repairing the reservoir suddenly increased from 60 to 200. The original plan was to complete the project within a month, but now it can be completed in just one week. In the past, the masses in Yizai Township, Nan靖, were not very enthusiastic about labor, and the attendance rate was only 50%. After Lai Rongde, the Deputy County Head working in the township, personally went down to the fields to carry manure with the masses, a large-scale manure accumulation campaign quickly kicked off. The attendance rate of the entire township increased to more than 90%, and the number of acres of manure accumulated by each laborer every day also increased from ten loads to fifteen loads. An old farmer in his eighties said, "In the past, the county head had to ride a horse or be carried in a sedan chair when he went out. Now that the people's county head participates in labor with us, we are willing to work ourselves to death." Thirteen cadres in Liangpu Township, Hua'an County, corrected the bureaucratic work style of "commune committee research, squad discussion, and team implementation" in the past, and worked with the masses in the fields. The masses happily said, "In the future, production will not be blindly carried out, and the commune head can solve the difficult problems below in a timely manner." The labor attendance in the township increased from 341 to 643. After the five main cadres in Chendai Town, Yunxiao, went down to the fields, the masses everywhere said, "The Five Tigers are out, and production will definitely be good this year," and their mood was very high.

Discover problems in time and solve problems in time

Second, due to the change in leadership style and going deep down, many problems existing in production and other work were discovered and discussed with the masses, and timely solutions were obtained. Comrade Zhou Shunmin, Minister of Cooperation of the Haicheng County Party Committee, visited four old farmers in Dongsizhou Township to solicit their opinions on some production technologies. These old farmers were very moved. They said, "The government now attaches so much importance to us old people, and the harvest this year will definitely be good." They also introduced methods to prevent rotten seedlings, such as melting the fields early and irrigating water according to the climate, as well as experience in grasping the season and watching the weather to soak seeds. At the same time, they unanimously affirmed that dense planting can increase production. This helped the branch solve and affirm many technical problems. In the six days that the Dongtou Township cadres went deep into production, they visited 105 commune members to understand the current production and agricultural commune situation, and helped the commune cadres solve them in a timely manner, which was well received by the commune members. Some commune members in the Qunming Commune are currently short of food, so the township cadres helped the commune committee to make careful calculations and pre-allocate 9,294 catties of grain to 44 households to solve their current difficulties so that they can concentrate on production. The Quncheng Commune adopted the method of purchasing farm manure from commune members with cash, which further improved the commune members' enthusiasm for accumulating manure; after helping the Qunhui Commune to make specific arrangements for labor, it has drawn a part of the labor force to carry out sideline production to solve the commune members' spring famine difficulties. In the past, the party branch secretary of Meilin Township, Zhangpu, did not participate in production and did not understand the production situation. This time, he went to the sixth team to produce and found that the team had more than 2,000 catties of seeds that had not been soaked in warm water. After mobilization and persuasion, the problem was solved in a timely manner.

Cadres go deep among the masses, and the masses care for the cadres

Third, the relationship between cadres and the masses has been improved. Facts have proved that as long as cadres can truly correct their shortcomings, the masses will not only not excessively blame them for the shortcomings in their past work, but on the contrary, they will be very considerate of the cadres. For example, when the cadres of Dazhai Township, Longxi, participated in carrying soil for three days, the commune members always asked them to get off work early and rest early, saying that they were not used to working and had to take their time. After the township head of Dongshan Township went down to the fields, the commune members asked him to work nearby and went to the distance themselves, fearing that someone would look for him and delay his work. In the past, the branch secretary of Shancheng Town, Nan靖, did not go deep into his work, and the masses had a lot of opinions, saying that his labor was lighter than that of the commune members, but he received more money. This time, the town branch secretary participated in labor and went up the mountain with the commune members to produce. When he came back, his hand was also scratched. An old farmer saw it, took his hand and said, "If you work so hard, you should be paid ten yuan more per month." A seventy-year-old woman in Shangwu Township, Haicheng, saw the branch secretary and township head going down to the fields and automatically boiled water to give them to drink.

Although the cadres and the masses generally reacted very well after the cadres went down to the fields in the previous stage, some problems were also discovered. On the one hand, some township cadres still used the excuse that "full-time cadres go down to the fields to work, which will make the masses say they are selfish and self-interested" and are unwilling to change their past aloof style of detachment from the masses; on the other hand, some people still have doubts about whether the township cadres can truly and thoroughly change their leadership style. They say, "This is probably arranged by the higher authorities!" Some people satirized the cadres when they went down to the fields, saying, "The landlord has gone down to the fields, and there will definitely be a big flood this year," and "Your going down to the fields like this will affect your work." From the perspective of the cadres: a large part of them are actively taking the lead in promoting, and they are not so aware of the fact that personally participating in labor is a good leadership method for going deep into leadership and solving problems in a timely manner. Therefore, the cadres must continue to be educated and improved to consolidate this new work style.

Secondly, after the cadres participated in labor, there are still two specific problems that need to be studied and resolved:

First, how to improve the work system at the township level. Now, universal attention has been paid to reducing meetings (for example, some areas have changed from the original daily meeting of full-time cadres to one every two or even three days; some stipulate that meetings are generally not allowed during the day, and evening meetings do not exceed 11 pm, etc.). The regular methods in the township are basically two methods: one is for full-time township cadres to take turns on duty; the other is to work in the fields in the morning and work in the office in the afternoon and evening, or work in the office for one day every two days.

Second, after the cadres went down to the fields, some of them have already received a lot of work points. Therefore, both cadres and commune members naturally raised the issue of work point subsidies for full-time commune cadres in the future. However, generally speaking, it has not yet been started to be resolved.

In short, all localities do not yet have mature experience in the above two issues, and leaders at all levels need to pay attention to research and solve them in a timely manner.

    三头受气变成三头满意
    中共龙溪地委关于区乡干部社干部参加生产领导生产和改进领导作风的报告省委并各县市委：
    贯彻党八届二中全会决议以来，普遍重视了在区、乡干部中进行艰苦朴素与群众同甘苦共患难的思想教育。2月上旬各县召开的三级扩干会议上，又以整风精神总结检查了1956年的工作，批判了领导上官僚主义、主观主义、行政命令等脱离群众的作风，并决定在农村开展一个以春耕生产为中心的民主整风整社运动；同时还从地、县直属机关抽调了一千六百一十三个干部（县级以上干部一百七十八名），深入农村加强基层领导，因而，区、乡干部中艰苦朴素的作风普遍较前大有发扬和成长。这一段最突出的标志是：干部鞋子脱掉了，下田生产去了，深入到群众中和群众同吃、同住、同劳动。南靖县委副书记沈山水同志和农民一起挑大粪；诏安县副县长林克治帮助群众修水利，连挑了二、三十担土都没休息；龙溪县古县区的区委副书记蔡正南和团区工委副书记曾兴化两位同志，学习昌黎县委副书记江水贺同志的办法，带粪箕下田检查生产，一天中既澄清了社的生产情况，又拾得了六十多斤猪、牛粪，给乡、社干部树立了榜样，给群众很大鼓舞。有的群众说：“这样的干部，就像土改时的干部了”。乡、社干都下田更是普遍，群众很满意，有的说：“干部换了骨头”，“这样才像个当家作主的样子”。南靖县溪边乡的党支书、乡长回乡后，就把脱离群众的扑克牌撕破，参加社里生产，并带头跳到水最深的地方修水利。很多群众反映：“这次县里开会比吃补药作用还大”。他家里的人也说：“政府这次开的是好会，人都变了。”干部反映现在是由“三头受气变成了三头满意”。根据南靖、龙溪、海澄、华安等四个县不完全的统计，七百零二个下乡的工作组干部中，能够深入田间和群众一起干活的有四百九十五人，占到乡总数的70％；另据长泰、龙溪、南靖、海澄、华安等五个县统计，在二千二百四十三个乡的主要干部（绝大部分是脱产的）中，能够真正改变作风，脱鞋下田，带动群众搞生产的有一千八百零八人，占总数的80.6％。
    随着干部作风的转变，生产松劲、干群关系紧张的情况起了很大的变化，农村工作已出现了一片新气象。
    提高了群众生产积极性
    第一，在干部“脱鞋下田”的带动下，大大地提高了群众生产积极性，使春耕生产运动逐步形成高潮。如前述的诏安县副县长林克治在大坑塘水库参加修水库后，修筑水库的民工一下子从六十人增至二百人，原计划一个月内完工，现在只要一个星期就可结束。南靖刈仔乡原来群众劳动情绪不高，出勤率只达50％，在该乡工作的副县长赖荣德亲自下田和群众一起挑大粪后，一个规模巨大的积肥运动迅速掀开了，全乡出勤率提高到90％多，每个劳力每天的积肥亩数也由十担提高到十五担。一个八十多岁的老农说：“过去县长出门不骑马也得坐轿，现在人民的县长和我们一起参加劳动，我们就是干到死也甘愿。”华安县良埔乡十三个干部纠正了过去“社委研究、中队讨论、小队贯彻”的官僚主义作风，和群众一起下田生产，群众欢喜地说：“今后生产不会盲目干，下面困难问题社长能及时解决。”该乡劳力出勤由三百四十一人增加到六百四十三人。云霄陈岱镇的五个主要干部下田后，群众到处说：“五虎齐出，今年生产一定可以搞好”，情绪很高。
    及时发现问题  及时解决问题
    第二，由于领导作风的改变，深入下去，许多生产和其他工作上存在的问题被发现了，并和群众商量，得到了及时解决。海澄县委合作部长周顺民同志在东泗乡领导生产中，登门访问四个老农，请教他们一些生产技术，这些老农很感动，他们说：“政府现在对我们老年人这样重视，今年收成一定好”，他们还分别介绍了提早溶田，根据气候进行排灌水等防止烂秧的办法，以及掌握季节看天气浸种等经验，同时他们还一致肯定了密植能够增产。这就帮助支部解决和肯定了很多技术上的问题。东头乡干部在深入生产六天中访问了一百零五户社员，了解了当前生产和农业社的情况，帮助社干部及时作了解决，社员反映很好。该乡群明社有一部分社员目前缺口粮，于是乡干就帮助社委会进行精打细算，先预支出九千二百九十四斤谷子借给四十四户解决目前困难，使他们安心生产。群成社则采取以现款向社员购买农家肥办法，进一步提高了社员积肥积极性；群惠社经过帮助具体安排劳力后，已抽出一部分劳力进行副业生产，解决社员春荒困难。漳浦梅林乡党支书过去不参加生产，生产上的情况不了解，这次他到第六队生产，发现了该队有二千多斤种子，没有采取温汤浸种，经过动员说服，及时解决了。
    干部深入群众  群众关怀干部
    第三，改善了干群关系。事实证明，只要干部能够真正改正缺点，群众不但不会过分责备他们过去工作中的缺点，相反的对干部是十分体贴的。例如龙溪大寨乡干部参加挑土三天，社员总是叫他们早下工，早休息，说他们劳动不习惯了，得慢慢来。东山乡乡长下田后，社员叫他在近处劳动，自己到远处，怕有人找他不方便误了工作。南靖山城镇支部书记过去工作不深入，群众很有意见，说他劳动比社员轻，领钱却比群众多得多。这次镇支书参加劳动了，和社员一起上山生产，回来时手也划破了，一个老农民看见了，拉着他的手说：“像你这样艰苦工作，每月应多发十元钱”。海澄上午乡一个七十多岁的老太婆，看见支书、乡长下田，自动烧开水送给他们喝。
    虽然，前段干部下田后，干部、群众普遍反映很好，但也发现有些问题。一方面还有的乡干部借口“脱产干部下田干活，会给群众说自私自利”，不愿改变过去高高在上的脱离群众作风；另一方面是还有一部分群众对乡干部是否能真正、彻底的改变领导作风还有怀疑，他们说，这大概是上级有布置吧！也有的看干部下田时讽刺说：“地主下田了，今年一定涨大水”、“你们这样下田，会影响工作”。而从干部来说：很大一部分是为了积极带头推动，而对亲自参加劳动是深入领导，及时解决问题的良好领导方法尚未那么意识化，因此，对干部还必须继续教育提高，把这种新的工作作风巩固起来。
    其次，干部参加劳动后，还有两个具体问题需要研究解决：
    第一，如何改进乡一级的工作制度问题。现在普遍是已经注意了减少会议（例如有的地区原来脱产干部每天碰头改成为二天甚至三天才碰一次；有的规定白天一般不准开会，晚上会议不超过十一点等），乡里的经常办法，基本上是两种作法，一种是脱产的乡干轮流值日；另一种采取上午下田，下午晚上办公，或两天办一天公的办法。
    第二，干部下田后，有的已经得到了不少的工分，于是在干部和社员中很自然地都提出了关于今后社脱产干部的工分补贴问题。但普遍尚未着手进行解决。
    总之，上述两个问题，各地均尚未有较成熟的经验，需各级领导及时引起注意研究解决。
