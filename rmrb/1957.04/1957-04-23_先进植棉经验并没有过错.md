Advanced Cotton Planting Experience Is Not Wrong
Gao Mingqing

In 1956, cotton-growing areas across the country widely publicized and promoted advanced technologies such as early sowing, close planting, and pruning of cotton. Practice has proven that, combined with local conditions, correctly adopting these advanced technical experiences can significantly increase production. Last year's natural disasters were relatively severe, and the national cotton production did not meet the plan. However, provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, Shaanxi, Liaoning, and Jiangxi, which were not affected or were less affected by the disasters, still increased their average yield per unit area by more than 20% to 40% compared to 1955. At the same time, many high-yield models emerged in various cotton-producing areas. In Hubei Province alone, there were 712 agricultural cooperatives with an average yield of more than 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu. The cotton-planting model workers who participated in the National Agricultural Labor Model Representative Conference also unanimously affirmed the important role of advanced cotton-planting technology. The average yield per mu of cotton fields in the agricultural cooperatives they led last year approached or exceeded the targets required by the "National Agricultural Development Program (Draft)" for 1956 to 1967, which called for "reaching 60, 80, and 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu within twelve years."

Last year, in some cotton fields, the promotion of advanced cotton-planting experience did not achieve the expected results, and even resulted in reduced production. As a result, some people said: "Early sowing actually delayed the emergence of cotton seedlings, resulting in a serious lack of seedlings." Others said: "Cotton grows wildly and reduces production, all because of close planting." Is this the case? According to the analysis of many facts, the important reason for these phenomena is that the principles of adapting to local conditions and adapting to the time were not well grasped in the promotion of advanced experience. Timely early sowing is a good experience, but last year, some areas sowed early on alkaline land and low-lying land in the same way as on general land, resulting in rotten seeds and ruined sowing. This can only be said to be untimely early sowing, which is a violation of advanced experience. Some areas, when implementing timely early sowing, did not pay attention to selecting fine cotton seeds and paying attention to sowing techniques, resulting in late emergence and a large number of missing seedlings. Naturally, this cannot be blamed on timely early sowing. Appropriate close planting is also an undoubtedly good experience. Some cooperatives applied excessive fertilizer after increasing planting density on small-area high-yield land, resulting in excessive growth and late maturity. How can this be blamed on close planting? Retaining more fruit branches under certain conditions is also a good experience. However, some places generally implemented the principle of retaining more fruit branches, mechanically delaying the topping time in many cotton fields where conditions were not sufficient, resulting in more shedding, more empty branches, late maturity, and reduced production. This obviously cannot be attributed to advanced cotton-planting experience.

Through last year's practice of improving cotton planting technology, many cadres and farmers in various cotton-growing areas have gained a lot of specific experience in how to further correctly implement cotton production-increasing technology in accordance with local conditions. They already know that, in order to sow early at the right time, even within an agricultural cooperative, the order of sowing must be arranged according to the different terrain and soil quality of each plot; in order to make close planting correct, it is necessary to specify different numbers of plants according to specific conditions (soil sandy or sticky, fertile or barren, high or low, and cotton plants compact or loose, etc.). They also know that close planting must be combined with technologies such as early sowing, early cultivation, early thinning, and early topdressing to make cotton plants grow neatly, compactly, and healthily. When to top and how many fruit branches to retain must be determined according to soil fertility, cotton plant growth, and local climate conditions. Sometimes, even in one plot of land, topping must be done in stages according to the growth of the cotton plants. This requires more thinking, more field investigation and research, and more consultation with experienced farmers; it is not that as long as there is advanced experience, everyone does not need to bother anymore.

This year, the cotton planting area cannot be expanded, but the total cotton output is required to be greatly increased. If we do not actively promote advanced high-yield experience, what can we rely on to complete the task of increasing cotton production? The problem of subjectivism and mechanical application must be prevented and corrected, but we must not adopt a negative attitude towards promoting advanced experience because of this.

    先进植棉经验并没有过错
    高铭卿
    1956年，全国棉区广泛地宣传推广了棉花的早播、密植、整枝等先进技术。实践证明，结合地区条件，正确地采用这些先进技术经验，是能起显著的增产作用的。去年的自然灾害比较严重，全国的棉花产量没有完成计划；可是，没有受灾或受灾较轻的湖北、湖南、陕西、辽宁、江西等省，全省平均的单位面积产量比1955年仍提高20％到40％以上。同时，各个产棉区都出现了许多大面积的丰产典型。仅湖北省就有七百一十二个农业社，平均亩产皮棉一百斤以上。参加全国农业劳动模范代表会议的植棉模范们，也一致肯定了先进植棉技术的重要作用。他们所领导的农业社全社棉田的平均每亩产量，在去年一年就接近或超过了1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要草案所要求的“十二年内亩产皮棉达到六十斤、八十斤和一百斤”的指标。
    去年也有部分地区的棉田，推广先进植棉经验没有收到预期的效果，甚至反而减产了。于是有人说：“提早播种，反而使棉苗迟出，严重缺苗。”也有人说：“棉花疯长、减产，都是密植的过。”是不是这样呢？根据许多事实分析，发生这些现象的重要原因是在推广先进经验中没有掌握好因地制宜、因时制宜的原则。适期早播是一条好经验，可是去年有些地区在碱地、洼地上也同在一般土地上一样早播，因而烂籽毁种。这只能说是早播得不适期，是违背了先进经验。有的地区在推行适期早播的时候，没有注意精选棉种和注意播种技术，因而发生出苗晚、缺苗多的现象。这自然也不能怪罪适期早播。适当密植也是一条无可怀疑的好经验。有些社在小面积丰产地增加种植密度以后施用了过多的肥料，以致引起疯长晚熟。这怎能怪罪密植呢？在一定条件下多留果枝，这也是一条好经验。可是，有的地方一般化地执行多留果枝的原则，在许多条件不够的棉田里也机械地延迟了打顶的时间，以致脱落多、空枝多、晚熟减产。这显然也不能归罪于先进植棉经验。
    通过去年改进植棉技术的实践，各棉区许多干部和农民对于如何进一步正确贯彻实施棉花的增产技术，已经取得许多因地制宜的具体经验。他们已经知道，为了适期提早播种，即使在一个农业社里，也要按地块分别不同的地势、土质，逐区安排播种的先后；为了密植做得正确，需要根据具体情况（土地沙粘、肥瘠、高低等和棉株紧凑松散等）分别规定不同株数。他们还知道了：密植要同早播种、早中耕、早间苗、早追肥等技术结合起来，才能使棉株生长整齐、紧凑、健壮；什么时候摘顶尖，留多少果枝，都要根据地力肥瘠、棉株生长情况和当地气候条件决定；有时即使在一块地里，也要按棉株生长情况，分次打顶。这就需要多动脑筋，多到田间调查研究，多同有经验的农民商量；并不是只要有了先进经验，就用不着大家再费什么脑筋了。
    今年植棉面积不能扩大，棉花的总产量却要求大大提高，如果不积极推广先进的丰产经验，我们靠什么完成增产棉花的任务呢？主观主义机械搬用的毛病必须防止和纠正，可是，决不能因此而对推广先进经验抱消极的态度。（附图片）
