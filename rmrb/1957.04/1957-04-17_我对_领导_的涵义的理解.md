My Understanding of the Meaning of "Leadership"
Tu Changwang, Director of the Central Meteorological Bureau

The meaning of the Party's leadership over natural science should be: determining the direction of natural science research, formulating guidelines and policies to achieve this direction, establishing tasks consistent with the guidelines and policies, planning work schedules to complete these tasks, and mobilizing and organizing forces to complete the plan.

Can the Party lead natural science? To answer this question, we must first clarify the meaning of leadership and what it leads. According to general understanding, leadership should include the following: determining the direction of natural science research, formulating guidelines and policies to achieve this direction, establishing important tasks consistent with the guidelines and policies, planning work schedules to complete these tasks, and mobilizing and organizing forces to complete the plan. If we agree that the above are the meaning and content of leadership, then I believe that the question of whether the Party can lead natural science does not actually exist. Because according to several years of experience, the Party has already led in these areas and has led very well. Now let me cite some facts to illustrate this point.

Regarding the direction and purpose of natural science research:

Before liberation, Chinese scientists rarely talked about this issue. If someone asked: Why do you do scientific research? The answers were nothing more than: researching for the sake of scientific truth, researching for one's own interest, researching to save the country through science. Of course, few scientists would directly answer that they were doing research for their own reputation and status in science. According to my subjective judgment, a considerable portion of scientists probably did research for the latter purpose, and I personally was one of them. After liberation, thanks to the Party's leadership and education, scientists' political consciousness has greatly improved, and the question of the purpose and direction of natural science research has basically been resolved. Now if you are asked again why you are researching science, the general answer is for the socialist construction of the motherland, to improve the material and cultural living standards of the people. From the perspective of China's scientific community, this is a huge transformation with historical significance, although the foundation of this transformation is not yet very solid. Is this huge change in the direction and purpose of scientific research not an achievement of the Party's leadership over natural science?

Regarding the guidelines and policies for natural science research:

Before liberation, Chinese scientists rarely talked about the guidelines and policies of scientific research. In fact, there were no guidelines or policies for scientific research at all. If there were, it was only that the four major families and a few capitalists developed one or two technical sciences for profit, or that scientists developed regional sciences for the convenience of conditions. Now the situation is very different. The principle of "combining theory with practice" and "combining research with needs" is familiar to every scientific worker, and in practice, many scientists have well implemented this principle and have already achieved remarkable results. Scientific research should not only solve current problems, but also solve future problems (i.e., scientific theory guiding production practice). This principle of taking into account both scientific theory research and scientific and technological research is also familiar to scientific workers. In order to effectively implement this principle, so that our scientific research work can better serve socialist industrialization and quickly catch up with international levels, we have also adopted the important policy of focusing on breakthroughs and developing on the basis of the world's latest science and technology. These important guidelines and policies were all proposed by scientists jointly under the leadership of the Party, and are supported by the broad masses of scientific workers. Does not the formulation of these guidelines and policies illustrate that the Party has already led the research work of natural science?

Regarding scientific research tasks and planning:

Under the leadership of the Party, scientists completed the twelve-year perspective plan for developing scientific research in our country last year. This is an inspiring and huge collective scientific creation! This huge draft plan has detailed provisions and explanations regarding the guidelines, tasks, central research issues, as well as the various steps and guarantee conditions for conducting natural science research. This huge plan itself fully illustrates that the Party can not only lead natural science, but also, in collaboration with scientists, formulate a great plan for developing scientific research that scientists themselves cannot formulate. If there are still scientists who doubt whether the Party can lead natural science, it is best to ask them to read this great creation.

Regarding mobilizing and organizing scientific forces:

No scientist doubts the Party's mobilization and organizational power. The Party, which once organized 600 million people to overthrow the Chiang Kai-shek feudal comprador regime, defeated the aggression of US imperialism, completed the socialist transformation, and is mobilizing and organizing 600 million people to victoriously build a socialist society, must be able to successfully mobilize all scientific forces to complete the twelve-year perspective plan for developing scientific research in our country. No one doubts this.

If my view of the meaning of leadership is correct, then my answer to this question is: the Party can not only lead natural science, but has also led it very well in the past few years.

As for the specific leadership of scientific research, such as what are the specific research questions, how should laboratories be built, what equipment is needed, what methods should be used to conduct research, etc., these are of course the scientists' own business. For these specific tasks, it is somewhat difficult for the Party to lead everything at present, and it is not very necessary either. Not leading on certain specific issues of scientific research does not mean that the Party cannot lead natural science research. If the Party does not provide technical guidance on the operating skills of certain fitters and turners, should we conclude that "the Party cannot lead workers in industrial production?" Such a question is very obvious, and it is not correct in itself.

### 我对“领导”的涵义的理解

    我对“领导”的涵义的理解
    中央气象局局长　涂长望
    党对自然科学领导的涵义应该是：确定自然科学研究的方向，拟定达到这个方向的方针政策，制定与方针政策相适应的任务，规划完成这些任务的工作计划，以及动员和组织力量来完成这个计划。
    党能否领导自然科学？要回答这个问题，我们首先要明确领导的涵义和领导些什么。据一般的了解，领导应该包括下面的一些内容：确定自然科学研究的方向，拟订达到这个方向的方针政策，制订与方针政策相适应的重要任务，规划完成这些任务的工作计划，以及动员和组织力量来完成这个计划。假如，我们同意上述各项是领导的涵义和内容，那么，我认为党能否领导自然科学的问题事实上并不存在。因为根据几年来的经验，党在这些方面已经领导了，并且领导得很好。现在让我举一些事实来说明这个问题。
    关于自然科学研究的方向和目的问题：
    在解放以前，我国的科学家很少谈到这个问题。如果有人问：你为什么要做科学研究工作？答复不外是：为了科学真理而研究，为了自己的兴趣而研究，为了科学救国而研究。当然，很少有科学家会直接了当地答复是为了自己在科学上的名誉和地位来做研究工作。据我的主观判断，恐怕有相当大的一部分科学家是为了后一个目的而作研究工作的，我个人就是其中的一个。解放后由于党的领导和教育，科学家的政治觉悟有很大的提高，对于自然科学研究的目的和方向这个问题基本上已经解决了。现在若是再问你为什么研究科学，一般的答案是为了祖国的社会主义建设，为了提高人民的物质生活与文化生活水平。从我国科学界来看，这是一个富有历史意义的巨大转变，虽然这个转变的基础还不十分巩固。在科学研究方向与目的的巨大转变，难道不是党领导自然科学的成绩吗？
    关于自然科学研究的方针政策问题：
    解放以前，我国的科学家很少讲科学研究的方针和政策。事实上，根本没有科学研究的方针政策。如果有的话，那只是四大家族及少数的资本家为了利润来发展某一两门技术科学，或者是科学家为了条件的便利而发展地域性的科学。现在情况大不相同了。“理论与实际相结合”，“研究与需要相结合”的方针是每一个科学工作者所熟悉的，并且在实践中有许多科学家已经很好地执行了这个方针，而且已经取得了显著成绩。科学研究一方面要解决目前的问题，同时也要解决将来的问题（即科学理论指导生产实践），这种科学理论研究与科学技术研究相兼顾的方针，也是科学工作者所熟悉的。为了有效地贯彻这个方针，使我们的科学研究工作很好地为社会主义工业化服务，并迅速地赶上国际水平，我们又采取了重点突破和在世界最新的科学技术基础上发展的重要政策。这些重要的方针政策都是在党的领导下，科学家共同研究而提出来的，并为广大的科学工作者所拥护。这些方针政策的制订不是说明党已经领导了自然科学的研究工作吗？
    关于科学研究任务与规划问题：
    在党的领导下，科学家去年完成了发展我国科学研究十二年远景规划。这是一件鼓舞人心的巨大的科学集体创作！这个巨大的规划草案，对于自然科学研究的方针、任务、研究的中心问题，以及进行研究的各种步骤及保证条件，均有详尽的规定和说明。这个巨大的规划本身充分地说明党不但能领导自然科学，而且能在科学家的协同下制订出科学家本身不能制订出的发展科学研究的伟大规划；假如，还有科学家怀疑党是否能领导自然科学的话，最好请他读一读这一个伟大的创作。
    关于动员组织科学力量的问题：
    没有一个科学家怀疑党的动员和组织力量。曾经组织过六亿人民推翻了蒋介石封建买办政权，打败了美帝国主义的侵略，完成了社会主义的改造，正在动员组织六亿人民胜利地建设社会主义社会的党，一定是能胜任愉快地动员一切科学力量来完成发展我国科学研究的十二年远景规划的。对于这一点没有一个人怀疑。
    假如我对领导的涵义的看法是正确的话，那么我对于这个问题的答案是：党不但能领导自然科学，并且在过去几年已经领导得很好。
    至于对科学研究的具体领导问题，例如具体的研究问题是什么，实验室应该怎样造，需要那些设备，用什么方法来进行研究等等，当然是科学家自己的事。对这些具体工作，事事需要党来领导，一方面在目前是有若干困难的，同时也不是很必要的。对于某些科学研究的具体问题不进行领导并不等于说党不能领导自然科学研究。假如党对某些钳工、车工等的操作技术不进行技术领导，我们是否就应该得出结论说“党不能领导工人进行工业生产呢？”这样的问题很显然，它本身就是不够正确的。
