Continue to Emancipate the Mind and Implement the Policy of "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend"

    It has been more than half a year since the Central Committee of the Party put forward the policy of "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend." How should we assess the initial effects of implementing this policy?

    We believe that although the time for implementing this policy is still very short, it can already be seen that the initial effects are good. Some people express doubts and wavering about this policy, believing that "emancipation" should be stopped and "control" should be implemented. This view is completely incorrect.

    "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" is not a temporary or expedient measure, but a long-term policy necessary for the development of culture and science. It will certainly take a relatively long time to see the tremendous gains this policy will produce in cultural construction. However, in the past six months or so, all departments of academic culture have been more active than in the past. In the fields of philosophy, literature, economics, history, law, and biology, heated and free debates have unfolded; more critical studies have been conducted on China's ancient cultural heritage and the academic thoughts of capitalist countries; the range of courses offered in universities has been expanded; and in literary creation, in film, drama, opera, music, and art activities, and in the sorting out of national artistic heritage and the promotion of national artistic traditions, a vigorous vitality has been demonstrated. Many people feel that their horizons have been broadened and their thinking has become more active. These are all good phenomena. The current problem is not that emancipation is too broad, but that it is not broad enough. The Party's task is to continue to emancipate the mind and adhere to the policy of "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend."

    Some people have different ideas about the Party's policy. In their view, if this continues, the ideological sphere will be in chaos, the direction of cultural and scientific development will become blurred, bourgeois ideology will run rampant, and Marxist theory will be shaken—in short, the future is simply unimaginable.

    The article "Some of Our Opinions on the Current Literary and Art Work" by Comrades Chen Qitong, Chen Yading, Ma Hanbing, and Lu Le, published in this newspaper on January 7, is a representative of this tendency. In their article, they painted a frighteningly bleak picture of the current state of literary and art circles: "In the past year, fewer and fewer people have advocated the direction of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the method of socialist realism in creation." "Some writers dare not write about the themes that truly reflect the current major political struggles, and few people advocate them anymore... Therefore, the combat effectiveness of literature and art has been weakened, the face of the times has become blurred, the voice of the times has become low, and the glory of socialist construction has become dim in the mirror of literature and art."

    Obviously, this assessment is an extreme distortion of the facts. This has already been pointed out in Comrade Chen Liao's article in this newspaper on March 1, Mr. Mao Dun's article on March 18, and the majority of reader responses compiled on the seventh page of this newspaper on April 4. The question is why there is such an extremely distorted assessment? This is because, up to now, many comrades within the Party still disagree with the policy of "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" in practice. Therefore, they one-sidedly collected some negative phenomena, exaggerated and amplified them, attempting to prove the "harm" of this policy and "advise" the Party to quickly change its policy. However, the Party cannot accept their "advice" because their policy is not Marxism, but anti-Marxist dogmatism and sectarianism. They do not understand that at no time should we adopt the method of suppressing and prohibiting incorrect ideas among the people, but only the method of reasoning, conducting criticism, and carrying out persuasive education. At present, as our country has just entered the transition period of socialism, adhering to this policy is of particular significance.

    Although our country has now realized the joint state-private operation of capitalist industry and commerce across the board, the bourgeoisie still exists; although it has realized the cooperation of agriculture and handicrafts, the petty-bourgeois ideology and even bourgeois ideology of more than 500 million former petty-bourgeois elements will still exist for a long time. The majority of intellectuals in our country originally belonged to the category of bourgeois intellectuals, and there is still a considerable distance to go in their thinking before they can become working-class. Under such circumstances, it is inevitable and not at all surprising that bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideologies are expressed in the field of academic culture in our country. The task of the Party, the task of Marxists, is to use the method of reasoning to conduct appropriate and convincing criticism of the various manifestations of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology, in order to help intellectuals progress faster and help petty-bourgeois elements and bourgeois elements progress faster. If we adopt the method of suppression and prohibition, then, for the Party and Marxists, this is not to fulfill their own tasks, but to cancel their own tasks; and for the things that are suppressed and prohibited, the result of doing so can only be that they are suppressed but not convinced, prohibited but not stopped. Therefore, this approach and thinking are incorrect.

    All truth has always developed in the process of fighting against wrong things, and Marxism has always developed in the process of fighting against anti-Marxist ideas. Without this struggle, there can be no development of truth, no development of Marxism. Therefore, the policy of "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" can only help and will not hinder the development of Marxism. In the contention of various schools, the emergence of correct new viewpoints is certainly good for Marxism; even the emergence of incorrect viewpoints is not something to be afraid of for Marxism. Marxism welcomes the discovery of all truths, because the discovery of all truths (regardless of whether these discoverers agree with Marxism) can enrich Marxism. Marxism has a high degree of partisanship, but this partisanship has nothing in common with sectarianism. Marxism is not afraid of criticism of various erroneous ideas, because history shows that even in the era when bourgeois ideology dominated, various theories hostile to Marxism did not prevent the development of Marxism. Ideological struggle is the driving force for the development of Marxism. Without struggle, Marxism will stagnate and will be transformed into its opposite—dogmatism.

    People ask: Is the recognition of the policy of "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" in conflict with the recognition of the leading position of Marxism in the ideological field?

    The leading position of Marxism, like the policy of "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend," is required and determined by objective existence, and cannot be arbitrarily stipulated or canceled by anyone. Our country is a socialist country led by the working class, which is a fundamental historical fact. Since the working class occupies a leading position politically and economically, and since it is leading the people of the whole country in building socialism, then the ideology of the working class that guides socialist construction—Marxism—will inevitably occupy a leading position ideologically. In fact, without the ideological leadership of the working class, there would be no political and economic leadership of the working class. As we have pointed out earlier, although the class struggle in our country has basically ended, the struggle between proletarian ideology and bourgeois ideology in the ideological field will continue for a long time. If Marxism does not lead this ideological struggle, bourgeois ideology will lead it. In a country led by the working class, allowing bourgeois ideology to lead the ideological field means allowing bourgeois intellectuals to call for capitalist restoration, which is not allowed by the interests of the working class and all working people. Therefore, the question is not whether or not to have the leadership of Marxism, but how Marxism should lead. The first thing to recognize here is that the ideological leadership of Marxism is completely different from the ideological rule of the reactionary classes in history. The reactionary classes use coercive means to restrict the people's freedom of speech and force the people to believe what and not to believe what. The socialist country led by the working class, because it represents the interests of the masses of the people and is supported by the masses of the people, only deprives the reactionary classes and counter-revolutionary elements of their freedom of speech, while fully guaranteeing the freedom of speech and belief of the masses of the people. The country led by the working class also takes various necessary steps to educate the people with the advanced Marxist ideology. It goes without saying that the leadership of Marxism presupposes the existence of non-Marxist ideas; without non-Marxist ideas, there would be no such thing as the leadership of Marxism. Therefore, educating the people with Marxism not only does not rely on force to "eliminate" non-Marxist ideas within the people, but also allows and requires discussions of different ideas among the people, so that the people can consciously reach correct conclusions through this discussion. Therefore, implementing the policy of "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom and a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" is precisely the necessary method for correctly realizing the leadership of Marxism.

    There were non-Marxists in the past, there are now, and there will be in the future. This also gives Marxists a serious task of publicizing Marxism. It can be asserted that because Marxism is an objective scientific truth, and because the scientific truth of Marxism is constantly victorious, the number of people who believe in Marxism will inevitably increase, and the number of true Marxists will inevitably increase. Marxists must rely on the power of their own theories, on the results of their own research, to convince non-Marxists, prove the truth of Marxism, and enrich the content of Marxism. When Marxists debate with non-Marxists, they need to adopt an attitude of reasoning, an attitude of analysis, an attitude of equality, and cannot adopt an attitude of intimidation, a one-sided, arbitrary, unanalyzed, metaphysical attitude, or an attitude of dogmatism and sectarianism. Although Comrades Chen Qitong and others subjectively want to persuade non-Marxists, their own attitude is not Marxist, but dogmatic and sectarian. Therefore, their criticism can only create ideological confusion, and in fact it has already created some ideological confusion. It should be admitted that the fact that this newspaper did not comment on their article for a long time after it was published is one of the important reasons for this confusion. Marxists should publicize Marxism, and precisely because of this, they should not only criticize the ideas of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie, but also criticize the dogmatic distortion of Marxism, and criticize the liberal attitude towards dogmatism. We are willing to put forward this point to encourage ourselves together with the readers.

### 继续放手，贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针

    继续放手，贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针
    从党中央提出“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针以来，现在已经半年多了。对于执行这个方针的初步效果，应该作怎样的估计呢？
    我们认为：执行这个方针的时间虽然还很短，但是已经可以看出，初步的效果是好的。有些人对于这个方针表示怀疑和动摇，认为应该停止“放”，实行“收”，这种意见是完全不正确的。
    “百花齐放、百家争鸣”并不是什么一时的、权宜的手段，而是为发展文化和科学所必要的长时期的方针。要看到这个方针在文化建设上产生巨大的收获，当然需要比较长的时间。但是，就在过去的半年多的时间中，学术文化的各部门已经比过去表现得活跃。在哲学界、文学界、经济学界、历史学界、法学界、生物学界，展开了热烈的自由的论争；对于我国古代的文化遗产和资本主义国家的学术思想有了更多的批判性的研究；大学里开设的课程扩大了范围；在文学创作方面，在电影、戏剧、戏曲、音乐、美术活动方面，在民族文艺遗产的整理和民族文艺传统的发扬方面，也都表现了蓬蓬勃勃的生气。许多人感觉到他们的眼界开阔起来了，思想活泼起来了。这些都是好现象。目前的问题不是放得太宽而是放得不够。党的任务是要继续放手，坚持贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针。
    有些人对于党的方针抱着不同的想法。照他们看来，这样下去，思想界将会一团混乱，文化科学发展的方向将要模糊，资产阶级思想将要泛滥，马克思主义的理论将要动摇——总而言之，前途简直是不堪设想。
    在本报一月七日所发表的陈其通、陈亚丁、马寒冰、鲁勒等四同志的文章“我们对目前文艺工作的几点意见”，就是这种倾向的一个代表。他们在文章里对于目前文艺界状况画了一幅吓人的暗淡的图画：“在过去的一年中，为工农兵服务的文艺方向和社会主义现实主义的创作方法，越来越很少有人提倡了。”“真正反映当前重大政治斗争的主题有些作家不敢写了，也很少有人再提倡了，……因此，使文学艺术的战斗性减弱了，时代的面貌模糊了，时代的声音低沉了，社会主义建设的光辉在文学艺术这面镜子里光彩暗淡了。”
    很明显，这种估计是对于事实的一种极端的歪曲。关于这一点，在本报三月一日陈辽同志的文章、三月十八日茅盾先生的文章和四月四日本报第七版所辑录的大多数读者的反应中，都已经指出了。问题是何以会有这种极端歪曲的估计呢？这是由于，到现在为止，党内还有不少同志对于“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针实际上是不同意的，因此他们就片面地收集了一些消极的现象，加以渲染和夸大，企图由此来证明这一方针的“危害”，由此来“劝告”党赶快改变自己的方针。但是，党不能接受他们的这种“劝告”，因为他们的方针并不是马克思主义，而是反马克思主义的教条主义和宗派主义。他们不了解：无论在什么时候，对于人民内部的不正确的思想，不能够采取压服和禁止的办法，而只能采取讲道理、开展批评、进行说服教育的办法。而在目前，在我国刚刚进入社会主义的过渡时期，坚持这一方针尤其具有重大的意义。
    我国现在虽然实现了资本主义工商业的全行业公私合营，但是资产阶级还存在着；虽然实现了农业和手工业的合作化，五亿以上的原来的小资产阶级分子的小资产阶级思想以至资产阶级思想还将在一个长期间存在。我国的知识分子的大多数，原来就属于资产阶级知识分子的范围，现在在思想上离开工人阶级化还有一个相当大的距离。在这种情况下，资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想在我国学术文化的领域内有所表现，是必然的，完全不足为奇的。党的任务，马克思主义者的任务，就是要用讲道理的办法跟资产阶级、小资产阶级思想的种种表现进行适当的有说服力的批评，以便帮助知识分子更快地进步，帮助小资产阶级分子和资产阶级分子更快地进步。如果采取压服和禁止的办法，那么，对于党和马克思主义者说来，这并不是实现自己的任务，只是取消自己的任务；而对于被压服被禁止的东西说来，这样作的结果，只能是压而不服，禁而不止。因此，这种作法和想法是不正确的。
    一切真理从来是在同错误的东西作斗争的过程中发展起来的，马克思主义也从来是在同反马克思主义的思想作斗争的过程中发展起来的。没有这种斗争，也就不能有真理的发展，不能有马克思主义的发展。因此，“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，只能帮助而不会妨碍马克思主义的发展。在各家的争鸣中，出现了正确的新论点，对于马克思主义固然有好处；就是出现了不正确的论点，对于马克思主义也没有什么可怕。马克思主义欢迎一切真理的发现，因为一切真理的发现（无论这些发现者是否赞成马克思主义）都能够丰富马克思主义。马克思主义具有高度的党性，但是这种党性同宗派主义毫无共同之点。马克思主义不害怕各种错误思想的批评，因为历史表明，即使是在资产阶级思想占统治地位的时代，各种同马克思主义敌对的理论也没有阻止得了马克思主义的发展。思想斗争是马克思主义发展的动力。不进行斗争，马克思主义就会停滞不前，就会转化为它的反面——教条主义。
    人们问：承认“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，同承认马克思主义在思想领域中的领导地位，是不是相冲突的呢？
    马克思主义的领导地位，也同“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针一样，是客观存在所要求和决定的，不是什么人可以任意规定或者取消的。我们的国家是工人阶级领导的社会主义国家，这是一个根本的历史事实。工人阶级既然在政治上经济上居领导地位，既然在领导着全国人民建设社会主义，那么，指导着社会主义建设的工人阶级的思想——马克思主义，也就不可避免地要在思想上居领导地位。事实上，没有工人阶级在思想上的领导，也就不会有工人阶级在政治上经济上的领导。我们在前面已经指出，虽然我国的阶级斗争已经基本上结束，但是在思想领域内，无产阶级思想同资产阶级思想的斗争还会继续一个很长的时间。对于这个思想斗争，如果马克思主义不去领导，资产阶级思想就要去领导。而在工人阶级领导的国家中，让资产阶级思想去领导思想领域，这就是说，让资产阶级知识分子去号召资本主义复辟，而这是工人阶级和全体劳动人民的利益所不允许的。所以，问题不在于要不要马克思主义的领导，而在于马克思主义如何去领导。这里首先要认清的是：马克思主义的思想领导完全不同于历史上反动阶级的思想统治。反动阶级用高压的手段来限制人民的言论，硬要人民相信什么和不相信什么。工人阶级所领导的社会主义国家，因为它代表着人民群众的利益，受到人民群众的支持，所以它只剥夺反动阶级、反革命分子的言论自由，而充分保障人民群众的言论和信仰的自由。工人阶级所领导的国家也采取各种必要的步骤，用先进的马克思主义的思想来教育人民。不言而喻，马克思主义的领导是以承认非马克思主义思想的存在为前提的；没有了非马克思主义思想，也就无所谓马克思主义的领导。因此，用马克思主义教育人民，不但不依靠强力去“消灭”人民内部的非马克思主义的思想，而且允许和要求在人民中间进行不同思想的讨论，以便让人民通过这种讨论自觉地达到正确的结论。因此，贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，正是正确地实现马克思主义领导的必要的方法。
    非马克思主义者过去有，现在有，将来还会有。这也就给了马克思主义者一项认真宣传马克思主义的巨大任务。可以断定，由于马克思主义是客观的科学真理，由于马克思主义的科学真理不断地取得胜利，相信马克思主义的人必然会越来越多，真正的马克思主义者必然会越来越多。马克思主义者要靠自己的理论的力量，靠自己研究的成果，来说服非马克思主义者，证明马克思主义的真理性，丰富马克思主义的内容。马克思主义者在同非马克思主义者辩论的时候，需要采取讲道理的态度，分析的态度，平等的态度，而不能采取虚声恫吓的态度，片面的、武断的、不加分析的、形而上学的态度，教条主义和宗派主义的态度。陈其通等四位同志在主观上虽然也要说服非马克思主义者，但是他们本身的态度就不是马克思主义的，而是教条主义和宗派主义的。因此，他们的批评只能造成思想上的混乱，而事实上也已经造成了思想上的某种混乱。应该承认，本报在发表了他们的文章以后，长期间没有加以评论，是造成这种混乱的重要原因之一。马克思主义者应该宣传马克思主义，正因为这样，就不但应该批判资产阶级小资产阶级的思想，而且应该批判对于马克思主义的教条主义的歪曲，批判对于教条主义的自由主义态度。我们愿意提出这一点，来与读者共勉。
