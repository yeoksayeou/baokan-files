Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: According to the cold wave situation released today by the Central Meteorological Science Research Institute: On the morning of the 10th, the cold air front had reached areas north of a line from Shanghai, Ganzhou, and Guilin. Temperatures dropped by more than ten degrees Celsius wherever the cold air passed. The lowest temperatures that appeared this morning generally dropped below 0 degrees Celsius in areas north of the Huai River, and below 5 degrees Celsius in areas north of the Yangtze River.
      During the intrusion of this cold wave, strong winds generally occurred in most areas. Provinces in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River and the Huai River basin generally experienced winds of force six to eight, and the wind force on the sea reached seven to nine in the Yellow Sea and six to eight in the Bohai Sea. When the cold wave front reached the Yangtze River bank on the night of the 9th, north winds of force seven to nine also appeared in areas on both sides of the Yangtze River. This morning, when the cold air reached the Nanling Mountains, there were still north winds of force five to seven in southern Hunan and northern Guangxi.
    In addition to the above situation, rain, snow, showers, and thunderstorms occurred widely from southern Inner Mongolia in the north to the northern Nanling Mountains in the south, from Shaanxi in the west to the coast in the east. This rain and snow is beneficial to the Shaanxi area and the Huai River basin, which have experienced little rain since the beginning of spring. In other areas, due to the large amount of precipitation, it also plays a certain role in maintaining soil temperature, which is estimated to offset some of the impact of the cold air.
    After 2:00 PM today, the rain has stopped in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River, the Huai River basin, and the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, and the weather has begun to improve, with the wind force also decreasing. The temperature may warm up slightly during the day, but after cooling at night, the lowest temperatures tomorrow morning and the day after tomorrow morning will be the lowest. Temperatures in the Yellow River basin and the Huai River basin are likely to drop below 0 degrees Celsius, and frost temperatures may occur in these areas. The lowest temperature in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River can be maintained between 2 and 5 degrees Celsius above zero. The above areas must be prepared for frost prevention in the next two days, especially tomorrow morning. After the 13th, the minimum temperatures will generally rise.

    寒潮南下气温普遍降低
    新华社10日讯　据中央气象科学研究所今天发布的寒潮情况说：10日早晨冷空气前缘已经到达上海、赣州、桂林一线以北的地区。冷空气所到之处降温在十度以上。今天早晨出现的最低气温，淮河以北各地一般均降到摄氏（下同）零度以下，长江以北的地区在五度以下。
      在这寒潮侵入的时候，大部地区普遍出现了大风。黄河中下游、淮河流域各省份风力一般有六—八级，海面上的风力在黄海达到了七—九级，渤海海面也有六—八级。当9日夜间寒潮前锋到达长江沿岸时，长江两岸地区也出现了七—九级的偏北大风。到今天早晨冷空气到达南岭时，湖南南部、广西北部等地区还有五—七级偏北大风。
    除以上情况以外，北从内蒙古南部起南到南岭北部，西起陕西，东到沿海，普遍出现了雨雪、阵雨和雷暴。这一场雨雪，对于入春以来少雨的陕西地区和淮河流域有好处，而其他地区由于降水量大的缘故，对地土温度还起到一定的保持作用，估计能抵消一部分冷空气的影响。
    今天十四时以后，黄河中下游、淮河流域以及长江中游等地区的雨已经停止，天气开始转好，风力也减小了。白天稍可回暖，但夜间冷却之后，明天早晨和后天早晨的最低气温将是最低的时候，黄河流域和淮河流域地区温度都有可能降到摄氏零度以下，这些地区都可能有霜冻温度出现。而长江中下游地区最低气温可以维持在零上二—五度之间。以上地区在最近两天内都必须做好霜冻预防准备，特别是明天早晨。13日以后最低温度都将普遍回升。
