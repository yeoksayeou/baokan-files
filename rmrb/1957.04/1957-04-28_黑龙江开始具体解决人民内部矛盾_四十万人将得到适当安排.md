Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 27th – In order to correctly handle contradictions among the people, the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Committee has begun to arrange and process over 400,000 farmers, demobilized soldiers, and middle and primary school graduates who have blindly flowed into the province from other provinces, as well as cadres and workers adjusted during streamlining.

The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Committee attached great importance to the arrangement and handling of the aforementioned 400,000 people, studying the matter several times before finally proposing a plan for their handling.

Currently, among the 50,000 farmers who blindly flowed into the province from other provinces, many have been placed in agricultural production cooperatives with more land and fewer people, and with wasteland to cultivate, or in better-conditioned immigrant new villages, except for a few who were unwilling to engage in rural production and were mobilized to return to their place of origin. The state has also issued them two million yuan in investment and one million yuan in loans, which will soon be in their hands. There are also specific plans for handling demobilized soldiers and cadres and workers adjusted during streamlining. 80% of this year's demobilized soldiers will return to the countryside to participate in production; demobilized soldiers who were born in cities and have technical skills or a considerable level of education will be employed in cities. At present, most of the more than 1,000 demobilized soldiers who have already returned have happily taken up agricultural production posts. Among the 20,000 cadres and workers adjusted during streamlining, a group of key members will be sent to work in grassroots units; elderly and sick female cadres and those with too many children and heavy household burdens will be mobilized to resign or retire; in addition, a group of young workers with a certain level of education will be selected to apply for secondary technical schools. The handling of these people should ensure that "those who stay are at ease, and those who leave are satisfied."

Regarding middle and primary school graduates who cannot continue their education, the Provincial People's Committee's measures are: all those who live in rural areas should be mobilized to participate in agricultural production, and those who have the conditions can also be organized to study on their own in their spare time; for students who live in cities, part of the students should be organized to participate in various handicrafts and service industries, in the spirit of arranging one if one can be arranged, and most graduates should improve their cultural level through various forms of self-study to prepare for gradual employment. Now, middle and primary schools throughout the province have begun to explain to students the rationale that not all middle and primary school graduates can continue their education. Some agricultural cooperatives have also begun preparations to welcome middle and primary school graduates to participate in agricultural production.

    黑龙江开始具体解决人民内部矛盾
    四十万人将得到适当安排
    新华社哈尔滨27日电　黑龙江省人民委员会为了正确处理人民内部的矛盾，对全省四十多万从外省盲目流入的农民、复员军人和中、小学毕业生以及整编中调整出来的干部、职工，开始进行安排和处理。
    中共黑龙江省委和省人民委员会非常重视对上述四十万人的安排处理，曾研究了几次，最后才提出了处理的方案。
    现在，从外省盲目流入省内的五万名农民，其中除少数人不愿到农村生产被动员返籍外，许多人已经被安插在地多人少、有荒可开的农业生产合作社里，或安插到条件较好的移民新村里。国家还向他们发放了二百万元的投资和一百万元的贷款，这笔钱即将发到他们的手里。对复员军人和整编中调整出来的干部、职工的处理，也有了具体方案。今年的复员军人有80％要回到农村参加生产；出生在城市和有技术或有相当文化程度的复员军人，将在城市就业。目前，已经回来的一千多名复员军人，其中绝大部分已经愉快地走上了农业生产岗位。二万名从整编中调整出来的干部、职工中，一部分骨干分子要被派到基层单位去工作；年老多病和子女过多、家务繁重的女干部，将动员他们退职或退休；另外抽调一批具有文化程度的青年职工报考中等技术学校。对这些人的处理要作到“留者安心，去者满意”。
    对不能升学的中、小学毕业生，省人民委员会的措施是：凡家居农村的应全部动员参加农业生产，有条件的还可以组织他们在生产之余进行自学；对家居城市的学生，应本着能安排一个就安排一个的精神，组织部分学生参加各种手工业、服务业，而大部分毕业生要通过各种自学形式，以提高文化水平，准备逐步就业。现在，全省的中学和小学，已开始向学生们讲清中、小学毕业生不能全部升学的道理。有些农业社并开始了迎接中、小学毕业生参加农业生产的准备工作。
