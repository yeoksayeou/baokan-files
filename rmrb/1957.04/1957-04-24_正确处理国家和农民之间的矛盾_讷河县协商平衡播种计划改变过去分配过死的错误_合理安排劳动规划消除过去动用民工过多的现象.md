Xinhua News Agency, Nehe, 21st - This year, Nehe County, Heilongjiang Province, has cleared up the contradictions that have existed for many years between the state and peasants in terms of crop planting plans. The county's planning department, together with various townships and cooperatives, based on national needs, adapting to local conditions, and ensuring increased production, went through four rounds of consultations and balancing. Recently, the sowing plans reported by various cooperatives to the county have all met the state's planning requirements, especially the planned sowing areas of important cash crops such as soybeans and sugar beets, which are in complete accordance with the state's planned requirements. This achieved "satisfaction on both ends" for the state and cooperatives.

Last year, the county's leading organs made some errors of commandism when allocating sowing plans to the cooperatives, with overly rigid demands. Last year, using the method of forced apportionment, the county勉强 increased the soybean sowing area from the previous 50,000 hectares to 65,000 hectares, which damaged the reasonable crop rotation system of many cooperatives, resulting in an average reduction of more than 400 jin per hectare of soybeans. In addition, excessively increasing the sowing area of high-yielding corn and excessively reducing the area of labor-saving spring wheat led to a serious shortage of labor in cooperatives during the busy farming season. Many cooperatives experienced delays in summer hoeing and harvesting, leaving some land uncultivated. Even worse, a large amount of grain was damaged in the fields due to untimely harvesting, which affected the increase in members' income.

This year, the county has learned from last year's lessons. After consulting with the provincial planning agencies, it has appropriately reduced the soybean sowing area by 10,000 hectares. Based on the principle of adapting to local conditions, it has appropriately increased the wheat sowing area. Furthermore, based on the policy of focusing on increasing grain production and comprehensively developing production, it has made reasonable arrangements for other crops in proportion. Because wheat cultivation is labor-saving and has a high output value, the increase in wheat sowing area can not only guarantee an increase in members' income, but also allow the saved labor to develop 18,000 hectares of paddy fields.

When allocating the sugar beet sowing plan, some cooperatives excessively emphasized the interests of the cooperatives and were unwilling to plant this crop, which is both labor-intensive and difficult to arrange in rotation. In response to this situation, the Chinese Communist Party organizations in various townships and cooperatives, through the example of a state-owned sugar factory in the county suspending operations half a month early this year due to insufficient raw materials, conducted education on patriotism and the worker-peasant alliance for the members. They also explained the reason that planting sugar beets is highly profitable and beneficial to both the state and the cooperatives. Only then did some cooperatives gladly accept the state's plan to plant sugar beets in full.

Xinhua News Agency, Nehe, 23rd - Making good labor plans for the mobilization of laborers, collective production by cooperatives, and sideline production by members' families is an important measure taken by Nehe County, Heilongjiang Province, in resolving the contradictions between the interests of the state, cooperatives, and members. This measure is being promoted throughout the county.

Last year, Nehe County mobilized a total of 460,000 laborers due to excessive construction of water conservancy projects, as well as road construction, supporting state-owned farms, and assisting in the construction of new immigrant villages, which is equivalent to more than 1,300 agricultural cooperative members not working in the cooperatives every day throughout the year. At the same time, the area of labor-intensive and high-yielding crops increased throughout the county last year, resulting in a labor shortage in most cooperatives, delays in summer hoeing and autumn harvesting, violation of farming seasons, and reduced yields or damage to many crops in the fields. Learning from last year's lessons, the county's leading organs have made "cherishing the people's strength and rationally using laborers" a principle of this year's labor use plan. Therefore, after considering and balancing the labor needs this year, it was decided to postpone a water conservancy project based on the principle of acting according to one's ability. This single item can reduce the mobilization of 80,000 compulsory laborers. The county's leading organs also require the relevant construction departments and enterprise departments in the county to strictly prevent blindly recruiting workers from cooperatives this year. The relevant agencies will also appropriately control the use of labor for supporting state-owned farms and the construction of new immigrant villages.

Most cooperatives have made appropriate arrangements for the planning of production time for cooperatives and sideline production by members' families when formulating their annual production plans. Many cooperatives have adopted methods such as a labor self-reporting system and rotating holidays during the slack season to adjust the working hours within the cooperative and in members' families. Now, most agricultural cooperative members throughout the county have prepared their firewood for this year, and the phenomenon of firewood shortages in towns and cities has also been eliminated. Family sideline production such as pig raising and weaving has also begun to become active. In addition, many cooperatives have also tapped more labor potential by adjusting the area of labor-saving and labor-intensive crops, improving labor organization, and mobilizing women to participate in field labor, in order to improve cultivation techniques.

### 正确处理国家和农民之间的矛盾  讷河县协商平衡播种计划改变过去分配过死的错误  合理安排劳动规划消除过去动用民工过多的现象

    正确处理国家和农民之间的矛盾
    讷河县协商平衡播种计划改变过去分配过死的错误
    合理安排劳动规划消除过去动用民工过多的现象
    新华社讷河21日电　今年，黑龙江省讷河县在农作物种植计划方面清除了多年存在的国家和农民之间的矛盾。这个县的计划部门同各乡、社根据国家需要、因地制宜、保证增产的原则，经过四次协商和平衡，最近由各合作社上报到县的播种计划，都已符合国家的计划要求，特别是大豆和甜菜等重要经济作物的计划播种面积和国家的计划要求完全符合。做到了国家和合作社“两头满意”。
    去年，这个县的领导机关在向合作社分配播种计划时，要求过死，曾经犯了一些强迫命令的错误。去年用强迫摊派的方法，勉强地把全县大豆播种面积从往年的五万公顷增加到六万五千公顷，结果破坏了许多合作社合理的轮作制度，使大豆每公顷平均减产四百多斤。另外，由于过多地增加了高产的玉米播种面积，过多地压缩了省工的春小麦面积，在农忙季节引起合作社劳动力严重不足，不少合作社夏锄和收获拖期，撂荒了部分土地，甚至由于收获不及时使得大量粮食糟损在地里，这些都影响了社员收入的增加。
    今年这个县接受了去年的教训，在请示了省的计划机关以后，已经适当地把大豆播种面积减少了一万公顷，又根据因地制宜的原则，把小麦的播种面积适当增加，还根据以增产粮食为主、全面发展生产的方针，对其他各种作物也按比例作了合理安排。由于种植小麦省工、产值高，小麦播种面积增加以后，不仅可以保证社员增加收入，而且可以用节省出来的劳动力开发一万八千公顷水田。
    在分配甜菜播种计划的时候，一些合作社曾经过分强调社的利益，不愿意多种这种既费工、又不易安排轮作的作物。针对这种情况，各乡、社的中共党组织通过在本县的一个国营糖厂今年因原料不足提前半月停工的事例，向社员们进行了爱国主义和工农联盟的教育，又讲清了种甜菜收益大，对国家和合作社都有利的道理，一些合作社才把国家种植甜菜的计划全部欣然接受下来。
    新华社讷河23日电　做好动用民工、合作社集体生产和社员家庭副业生产的劳动规划，是黑龙江省讷河县在解决国家、合作社、社员三者利益矛盾中所采取的一项重要措施。这个措施，正在全县推行。
    去年讷河县由于过多地兴办水利工程，以及修筑公路、支援国营农场和协助移民新村建设等，总共动用民工四十六万个，等于全年每天都有一千三百多名农业社社员不在社内劳动。同时，去年全县费工高产的作物面积增加，结果多数合作社发生劳动力不足现象，夏锄和秋收拖期，违背了农时，不少庄稼减产或糟损在田间。接受去年的教训，这个县的领导机关把“爱惜民力，合理地使用民工”做为今年劳动使用规划的一个原则。因此，在今年通盘考虑和平衡劳动量的需要之后，本着量力而行的原则决定缓办一项水利工程，仅此一项就可以少动用八万个义务民工。县的领导机关还要求县内各有关建设部门和企业部门今年要严格防止盲目到合作社里滥招工人；对于支援国营农场和移民新村的建设用工，有关机关也将加以适当地控制。
    对于合作社和社员家庭副业生产时间的规划，多数合作社在制定全年生产计划时都做了适当安排。许多合作社都采用了劳动自报制、农闲季节轮流放假等办法，对社内和社员家庭用工时间做了调整。现在全县的农业社社员大都已准备好今年的烧柴，城镇缺烧柴的现象也消除了。养猪、编织等家庭副业生产也开始活跃起来。另外，许多合作社还通过调整省工和费工作物的面积、改进劳动组织、发动妇女参加田间劳动等办法，挖掘出更多的劳动潜力，用以改进耕作技术。
