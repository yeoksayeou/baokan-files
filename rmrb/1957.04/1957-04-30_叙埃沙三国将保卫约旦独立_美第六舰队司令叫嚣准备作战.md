(Comprehensive report by our newspaper) The Syrian Foreign Ministry issued a public statement on April 28th stating that defending Jordan's independence is one of the cornerstones of Arab policy. Syria, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia will take appropriate steps when necessary to implement this policy.

President Kuwatly, after consulting with the Egyptian and Saudi Arabian governments regarding the situation in Jordan, returned to Damascus and convened a cabinet meeting. The public statement issued after the meeting said: "The Syrian delegation's talks with the Egyptian and Saudi Arabian governments discussed the most important Arab issues. The meeting exchanged opinions and intelligence regarding the situation in Jordan. The three countries and Jordan are linked by Arab national policy. The aim of this policy was defined at the recent quadrilateral Arab conference. The three governments have adopted this policy in order to achieve their common interests, because any harm suffered by any one of the three countries is harm suffered by all three. Protecting the brotherly country of Jordan is the foundation of this policy."

Western news agency reports say that it is believed that the outcome of this meeting is that Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia will jointly adopt a compromise approach to the situation in Jordan.

According to a TASS report on the 29th, a Syrian government spokesperson issued a statement regarding the deployment of the U.S. Sixth Fleet to the eastern Mediterranean, saying: "Sending the Sixth Fleet to the Arab coast is a threat, and it also proves that the American diplomatic authorities do not understand the true situation in the Middle East, nor do they understand the firm determination of the liberated Arab nations' leaders to implement the policy of Arab liberation, unafraid of any threats or enticements."

On the same day, the commander of the U.S. Sixth Fleet, Brown, openly boasted that the current mission of the Sixth Fleet in the eastern Mediterranean is to be "ready for combat—any type of war." Reports say that the advance units of the Sixth Fleet had already arrived in the eastern Mediterranean on the 27th and will be deployed along the Turkish coast.

The "New York Times" also revealed in an editorial that the United States' deployment of the Sixth Fleet to the eastern Mediterranean is not only aimed at Jordan, but also at Egypt and Syria. The newspaper said that if the pro-Western elements in Jordan are victorious, "then the far-right elements in Syria, who have been preparing to act in recent months, will be encouraged to take action" against the current Syrian government.

In recent days, Eisenhower, who is on vacation in Augusta, Georgia, has repeatedly consulted with Dulles by telephone regarding the Jordanian situation.

### 叙埃沙三国将保卫约旦独立  美第六舰队司令叫嚣准备作战

    叙埃沙三国将保卫约旦独立
    美第六舰队司令叫嚣准备作战
    本报综合报道　叙利亚外交部4月28日发表公报说，保卫约旦的独立是阿拉伯政策的基础之一。叙利亚、埃及和沙特阿拉伯将在必要时采取正确的步骤来执行这项政策。
    库阿特利总统在同埃及和沙特阿拉伯政府会商约旦局势后回到大马士革召开了内阁会议，会后发表的这项公报说：“叙利亚代表团同埃及和沙特阿拉伯政府的会谈讨论了最重要的阿拉伯问题。会议曾经就约旦的局势交换了意见和情报。三国同约旦是由阿拉伯民族政策联系着的。这种政策的目的在最近的四国阿拉伯会议上被确定了下来。三国政府为了求得它们的共同利益，都采取了这种政策，因为三国中任何一国所受到的伤害也就是三国共同遭受的伤害。保护兄弟国家约旦就是这种政策的基础。”
    西方通讯社的消息说，据信这次会谈的结果就是埃及、叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯三国将对约旦局势共同采取某种折衷解决的态度。
    据塔斯社29日消息，叙利亚政府发言人就美国第六舰队往地中海东部调动这件事发表谈话说：“派遣第六舰队到阿拉伯海岸，这是一种威胁，同时也证明了美国的外交当局不能理解中东的真实情况，不理解已经获得解放的阿拉伯国家的领袖不怕任何威胁利诱而要执行阿拉伯解放政策的坚定决心。”
    同一天，美国第六舰队司令布朗公开叫嚣第六舰队目前在东地中海的使命是“准备作战——任何类型的战争”。有消息说，第六舰队的先遣部队已经在27日到达东地中海，并将在土耳其沿海部署。
    “纽约时报”也曾经在一篇社论里透露，美国把第六舰队调到东地中海去不仅是针对约旦的，而且也是针对埃及和叙利亚。报纸说，如果约旦的亲西方分子取得胜利，“那么在最近几个月来准备行动的叙利亚的极右派分子就会得到鼓舞而行动起来”，来反对叙利亚的现政府。
    连日以来，在佐治亚州奥古斯大休假的艾森豪威尔多次同杜勒斯在电话中商谈了约旦局势问题。
