Good News from the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research

On April 16th, a bulletin of good news was posted on the gate of the Synchrophasotron building at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. The duty engineer, Smirnova, wrote the following record: "At 11:18 PM on April 16th, the accelerator successfully accelerated each proton beam to 10 billion electron volts." This is the first time in the history of physical science that protons have been accelerated to such an extent.

Attracted by the accelerator's significant achievement, the reporter made a special visit to this building near Moscow, which allows mankind to delve into the mysteries of the microscopic world. The circular track of this unparalleled accelerator has a diameter of 60 meters. During our visit, the duty engineer was working at the central control console, 50 meters away. Installation workers were carrying out final checks. They were about to leave because the protons had not yet reached the required intensity, so people could still stay. When the machine is running, workers cannot stay near it. Scientists can only observe and study in the basement, separated by 15-meter-thick protective walls. At that time, the accelerator will emit a warning sound that can be heard from afar, as well as a slight sound of protons impacting the atomic nucleus.

Academician Veksler of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, the director of the design and construction of this accelerator, received us in his office and introduced the accelerator's situation. He pointed out that although the proton energy can already be accelerated to 10 billion electron volts, the accelerator has not yet reached the required intensity. We are now working hard to bring the accelerator to its required intensity for research work. Originally, the proton movement in this accelerator was pulsed, meaning that five proton beams pass through per minute. Now, the number of protons in each beam is still very small, but it will gradually increase in the future. It will probably reach the required intensity by summer. At that time, research work can begin. Veksler said that the primary research work is to study the effect of accelerated protons on the atomic nucleus and to search for new, unknown particles. In addition, we are working to make the accelerator run more smoothly, although it has been working normally so far.

Veksler also said that this accelerator was designed by Soviet scientists and built by Soviet engineers. However, scientists from other countries are jointly participating in the research work. For example, Czechoslovak engineer Doležal is working with a group of Soviet engineers to use new methods to bring the protons to the required intensity. Chinese scientist Wang Ganchang is leading a group to build a bubble chamber to study the movement of particles. Romanian scientist Katz is working with Soviet scientist Petukhov to study an emulsion whose role is to leave traces of the protons' effect on the atomic nucleus for observation and research. Scientists from the twelve countries participating in the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research regularly exchange experiences and work together very amicably.

    联合原子核研究所的喜报
    联合原子核研究所的同步稳相加速器的建筑物大门上，16日张贴了一张喜报，值班工程师斯密那写下了这样的记录：16日晚十一点十八分加速器已经将每束质子加速到一百亿电子伏特。在物理科学的历史上这还是第一次将质子加速到这样的程度。
    记者为加速器的重大的成就所吸引，特地去参观了莫斯科近郊这座使人类深入微观世界奥秘的建筑物。这座举世无匹的加速器的环行道，直径就有六十公尺。我们参观的时候，值班工程师正在五十公尺以外的中央管理台工作。安装工人正在进行最后的检查。他们就要离开这里。因为质子还没有达到应有的强度，人们还可以停留。而机器开动的时候，工人就不能停留在它旁边。科学家们只能在被十五公尺厚的保护墙隔断的地下室里进行观察研究了。那时，加速器将发出很远都能听到的警号声音和质子冲击原子核的轻微的声音。
    这座加速器的设计和建造工作的主持人苏联科学院通讯院士维克斯勒在他的办公室接见了我们，并且向我们介绍了加速器的情况。他指出，虽然质子能量已经能加速到一百亿电子伏特，加速器还没有达到应有的强度。现在我们正在努力使加速器达到应有的强度以便进行研究工作。原来这部加速器中的质子运动是脉冲动式的，就是说，每一分钟通过五束质子。现在每一束中的质子数量还很少，将来会逐渐增多起来。大概到夏天，就可能到达应有的强度。那时研究工作就可开始了。维克斯勒说，首先的研究工作大体上是研究加速了的质子作用于原子核的情况，寻找新的、还不知道的粒子。另外，我们正在努力使加速器工作得更平稳，虽然到现在为止，它的工作一直是正常的。
    维克斯勒还说，这部加速器是苏联科学家设计，苏联工程师建造的。但是其他国家的科学家们正在共同参加研究工作。例如捷克斯洛伐克工程师多列扎里正在和一批苏联工程师一道，用新的方法使质子达到应有的强度。中国科学家王淦昌正在领导一个小组，建立一个研究粒子运动的气泡室。罗马尼亚科学家卡茨正在和苏联科学家佩图霍夫研究一种乳状液，它的作用是使质子对原子核的作用留下痕迹，以便观察和研究。参加联合原子核研究所的十二个国家的科学家们经常彼此交换经验，非常友好地在一起工作着。
