Xinhua News Agency, April 3rd (Xinhua News Agency reporter Lu Gongmin reports): Central government agencies and organizations spent nearly 10 million yuan less on administrative expenses in the first quarter of this year compared to the same period last year. Among these, public utility expenses decreased by about 50%, and their proportion of administrative expenses also decreased from 60% in the first quarter of last year to 40%.

The three items of telecommunications, meetings, and travel expenses, which have always been major expenses for central government agencies, were the focus of savings for each unit. All three of these expenses decreased in the first quarter. According to a survey of 18 units, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Foreign Trade, and the Ministry of Justice, telecommunications expenses decreased by 60% to 80%. After the State Planning Commission adopted strict review and control measures, telecommunications expenses for January and February this year only amounted to over 3,400 yuan, while they were nearly 40,000 yuan during the same period last year. The Ministry of Culture stipulates that anyone who needs to make a long-distance call must first write a draft, which must be approved by the director of the General Office. In the past, any telephone in the ministry could make long-distance calls; now, it is stipulated that only one telephone can be used. As a result, monthly long-distance telephone expenses have decreased from 2,000 yuan to 300 yuan.

In the vigorous effort to tighten administrative expenses, various meetings have also been greatly streamlined. In the two months from January to early March, central government agencies held a total of 78 national professional conferences, with more than 9,000 participants. Last year, an average of 98 meetings were held each month, with more than 13,000 attendees. In addition, nearly half of these meetings did not rent hotels but instead used guest houses or collective dormitories within the agencies. According to incomplete statistics, this alone saved more than 8,700 yuan in rent per day. Food subsidies for meeting participants have also changed from the long-term exceeding of standards in the past. All garden tours, dinners, and other activities during meetings have also been greatly reduced; even if they are held, they are borne by the meeting participants themselves.

Office, equipment, and other miscellaneous expenses have all decreased to varying degrees. After careful calculation, many units made full use of old furniture, paper, and stationery from the past this quarter and did not purchase new ones. Some units, without affecting work, widely mobilized cadres to use various waste reports, newspapers, and envelopes, saving a lot of paper. Many leaders consciously refrained from asking the agency for the use of cars for personal matters, and even if they did use them, they took the initiative to pay. This not only saved gasoline but also had a positive impact on the cadres.

### 精简会议　紧缩开支　利用废旧物品  中央机关行政经费开支显著下降

    精简会议　紧缩开支　利用废旧物品
    中央机关行政经费开支显著下降
    新华社3日讯　新华社记者卢恭敏报道：中央机关、团体今年第一季度行政经费开支比去年同期少花了近一千万元。其中，公用费开支减少了50％左右，它在行政经费中的比重，也从去年第一季度的60％下降到40％。
    中央机关一向开支较大的电讯、会议和差旅等三项费用，是各单位节约的重点，第一季度这三项费用都减少了。据外交部、交通部、对外贸易部、司法部等十八个单位的调查，电讯费比过去减少了60％到80％。国家计划委员会采取严格审核控制的办法后，今年1、2两月的电讯费只用了三千四百多元，而去年同期就用了近四万元。文化部规定凡需通长途电话的，必须事先写好讲稿，由办公厅主任审批；过去这个部任何一个电话机都可通长途电话，现在规定只准用一个电话机。这样，每月的长途电话费就从过去二千元下降到三百元。
    在大力紧缩行政经费开支中，各种会议也大大精简了，从1月到3月上旬的两个多月中，中央机关共举行了七十八次全国性专业会议，参加会议的有九千多人，而去年每个月平均举行的会议就有九十八次，出席的人数在一万三千人以上。另外，这些会议有近一半没有租用旅馆，而是在机关内腾用了招待所或集体宿舍。据不完全的统计，光这一项，每天就可节省租金八千七百多元。对参加会议人员的伙食补助，也改变了过去长期超过标准的现象。会议中所有游园、聚餐等项目也大大减少；即使举行，也由参加会议的人自行负担。
    办公、设置及其他杂项开支都有不同程度的下降。许多单位经过精打细算，在这个季度充分利用了过去旧存的家俱和纸张文具，没有购置新的。有些单位在不影响工作的情况下，广泛动员干部使用各种废旧表报、信封，节省了许多纸张。不少领导人员都自觉地不因私事向机关要小汽车使用，即便使用也都主动付款。这样不但节约了汽油，在干部中还起了良好的影响。
