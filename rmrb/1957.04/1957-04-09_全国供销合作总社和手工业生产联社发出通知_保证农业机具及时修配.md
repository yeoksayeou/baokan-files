Xinhua News Agency report: The All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives and the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Handicraft Production Cooperatives recently jointly issued a notice regarding the manufacturing, supply, and repair of parts for new-style farm tools and power machinery.

The notice pointed out that in recent years, a large number of new-style farm tools and power machinery have been promoted in various regions. Due to the use and wear and tear of these machines, the tasks of repairing and supplying agricultural machinery parts will inevitably become more arduous in the future. In order to adapt to this situation and enable the machinery already supplied to agricultural cooperatives to be used more fully, all regions must ensure that broken machinery can be repaired and missing parts can be supplied, and ensure that repairs are timely.

The notice stated that the task of manufacturing agricultural machinery parts has been uniformly arranged by the industrial departments, which will do their best to meet the needs of parts supply and repair departments in terms of variety, quantity, specifications, quality, and timing. The manufacturing of general parts for new-style farm tools should, in principle, be based on the province's production meeting the province's needs. Standard parts or parts with more complex manufacturing technology for large-scale farm tools (seeders, harvesters, disc harrows, spike-tooth harrows, etc.) and double-wheel double-furrow and single-furrow plows should be produced by production units with strong production technology designated by the provincial industrial departments. If the province's production capacity is insufficient or cannot meet the needs, orders should be placed from other regions.

The notice stated that the task of supplying parts for new-style farm tools is, in principle, the responsibility of the supply and marketing cooperatives. If in some areas in 1956, the supply and marketing cooperatives have transferred the task of supplying parts to the handicraft production cooperatives, whether to return it to the supply and marketing cooperatives this year or continue to be operated by the handicraft cooperatives can be negotiated by both parties based on the specific situation and reported to the local people's committee for decision and implementation. Regions where the supply and marketing cooperatives have not transferred to the handicraft departments should stop all transfers.

Regarding the repair of new-style farm tools, the local handicraft cooperatives are responsible for and uniformly arrange the work. If the handicraft cooperatives lack sufficient repair technology and equipment conditions and have difficulties in repairing new-style farm tools, especially large-scale farm tools, the local industrial production departments should provide assistance.

    全国供销合作总社和手工业生产联社发出通知
    保证农业机具及时修配
    新华社讯　全国供销合作总社和全国手工业生产合作社联合总社筹备委员会最近联合发出了关于新式农具、动力机械的零件制造、供应和修配工作的通知。
    通知指出，几年来各地推广了大量新式农具和动力机械，由于这些机具的使用和磨损，今后农业机具的修配和零件制造、供应任务必然更加繁重，为了适应这一情况，使已经供应到农业社的机具更充分的使用起来，各地必须做到机具坏了有处修、缺少零件有处配，并且保证修配及时。
    通知说，农业机具零件的制造任务，已统一由工业部门负责安排，并且在品种、数量、规格、质量、时间上尽力满足零件供应和修配部门的需要。新式农具一般零件的制造以本省生产满足本省需要为原则，其中大型农具（播种机、收割机、圆盘耙、钉齿耙等）和双轮双铧、单铧犁的标准件或制造技术较复杂的零件，由省工业厅指定生产技术较强的生产单位生产，如省内生产能力不足或不能适应需要时，再向外地订购。
    通知说，新式农具零件的供应任务原则上由供销社负责。1956年有的地区供销社已将零件供应任务移交手工业生产社负责的，今年是否交回供销社或仍由手工业社经营，可根据具体情况由双方协商并报请当地人民委员会决定执行。如供销社未移交给手工业部门的地区，一律停止移交。
    对于新式农具的修配工作，由各地手工业合作社负责和统一安排，如遇有手工业社修配技术和设备条件不足，对新式农具特别是大型农具修配确有困难时，地方工业生产部门应该予以协助。
