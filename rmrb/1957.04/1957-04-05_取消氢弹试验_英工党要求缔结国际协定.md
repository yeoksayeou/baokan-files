Xinhua News Agency, London, April 4th: The Labour Party parliamentary group decided at its meeting on the evening of the 3rd to call for the conclusion of an international agreement on the cancellation of hydrogen bomb tests, and urged the government to postpone hydrogen bomb tests for a limited period in order to consider the reaction of other countries to this initiative.

Labour MPs and "Shadow Cabinet" members are divided into the following three factions on hydrogen bomb policy: The first faction is the extreme right wing, represented by George Brown, the Labour Party's main spokesperson on defense issues. He insists on carrying out hydrogen bomb tests. The second faction, led by Gaitskell, proposed a motion broadly expressing disapproval of hydrogen bomb tests without mentioning the Christmas Island hydrogen bomb test plan. The third faction, represented by George Thomas, along with many others, proposed a motion demanding that the government abandon the planned Christmas Island test. These three factions held a series of meetings from the 2nd until the evening of the 3rd before passing a compromise proposal. The proposal stated: "This meeting of the party recognizes the harm to mankind from the continued nuclear explosions, reaffirms the party's previous decision to call for the cancellation of hydrogen bomb tests through international agreements, and strongly urges Her Majesty's Government to immediately take the initiative to make effective recommendations to other relevant countries for this purpose, while postponing the tests for a certain period so that the reactions of these governments to this initiative can be considered first."

    取消氢弹试验
    英工党要求缔结国际协定
    据新华社伦敦4日电　工党议会党团在3日晚上的会义上决定要求缔结关于取消氢弹试验的国际协定，并且敦促政府把氢弹试验推迟一个有限的时期，以便能够考虑其他国家对这个倡议的反应。
    工党议员和“影子内阁”阁员在氢弹政策上分成以下三大派：第一派是极端右翼的，以工党防务问题主要发言人乔治·布朗为代表。他坚持进行氢弹试验。第二派以盖次克尔为首，他提出一项动议，笼统地表示不赞成氢弹试验，而不提圣诞岛氢弹试验计划。第三派以乔治·托马斯为代表，他同许多别的人提出要求政府放弃计划中的圣诞岛试验的动议。这三派从2日起直到3日晚上开了一系列的会议，才通过了一项折衷提案。提案说：“党的这次会议认识到继续进行原子核爆炸对人类的危害，重申党在以前作出的要求通过国际协定取消氢弹试验的决定，并且强烈要求女王政府立即采取主动，为这个目的向其他有关国家提出有效建议，同时把试验推迟一定期限，以便可以首先考虑这些政府对于这个倡议的反应。”
