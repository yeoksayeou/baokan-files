    This year the supply of cotton cloth is very tight, and the second issue of cloth coupons for 1957 has to be used at half value. The most fundamental way to change this situation is to increase cotton production.
    Since liberation, China's cotton production has developed rapidly, but it is far from keeping up with the growth of the textile industry and the needs of the people's lives. In particular, in 1956, due to the impact of more severe natural disasters, the cotton production increase plan was not completed, which increased the tension in supply. Therefore, completing and overfulfilling this year's cotton production increase task is particularly important this year.
    How to complete this year's cotton production increase task? We must strive to increase the yield per unit area, and also ensure a certain cotton planting area. Since it is proposed that increasing the yield per unit area is the main method of increasing cotton production, why is it necessary to ensure the planned cotton planting area? It should be understood that the yield per unit of cotton can only be gradually increased with the improvement of material conditions (such as water conservancy, pesticides, fertilizers, agricultural tools, etc.) and technical conditions. It is by no means at the mercy of people's will, wanting to increase as much as they want. In order to ensure the completion of the total cotton production plan, there must be a certain cotton field area as a reliable foundation. Some people believe that in their area, although the cotton planting area is smaller than the national requirement, as long as the yield per unit is higher than the national requirement, the total output can also reach the national requirement. In fact, this is unreliable. The cotton yield per unit target for 1957 should be increased by five catties compared with 1956, and more than one catty compared with the bumper year of 1955; under the condition of maintaining the original cotton field area, the task of increasing the yield per unit area is already quite difficult. Judging from this year's conditions and the planned area of cotton fields, this year's production increase requirement is positive and reliable. If the cotton field area is reduced, in order to achieve the total cotton production target, the yield per unit area target will inevitably be increased again, making the original positive and reliable target become a positive but unreliable target. According to the situation in the past few years, we cannot completely control natural conditions, and the yield per unit of cotton is unstable. 1952 was a bumper year, with a yield of 31.2 catties per unit; in 1953 it dropped to 30.2 catties; in 1954, the disaster was severe, and the yield per unit dropped to 26 catties; 1955 was another bumper year, with a yield of 35.1 catties per unit; in 1956 it dropped again to the level of 1952. From this, it can be seen that if you think that as long as you strive to increase the yield per unit of cotton, you can not guarantee a certain cotton planting area according to the national plan, it is actually a risk. This matter is closely related to the lives of the people across the country, and this risk cannot be taken!
    Some people one-sidedly overemphasize the priority development of grain production, or only care about meeting the needs of agricultural cooperative members, regardless of the national plan, arbitrarily reduce cotton fields, or treat the planting area plan in a formalistic way—planting cotton on bad land. This is also wrong. Reducing the area will make the completion of the production increase task lose a reliable guarantee. Planting cotton on land that is not suitable for growth, although the planting area is guaranteed, it cannot guarantee the completion of the overall production increase task. This latter method is not just a risk, it is actually a self-deceiving practice. Who does this benefit?

### 不要冒这个险！

    不要冒这个险！
    今年棉布供应很紧张，1957年第二期布票不能不打对折使用。要想改变这种情况，最根本的办法是增产棉花。
    我国棉花生产，解放以来虽然有迅速的发展，但是远远赶不上纺织工业和人民生活的需要的增长。特别是1956年，由于较严重的自然灾害的影响，棉花的增产计划没有完成，增加了供应上的紧张程度。因此，完成和超额完成今年的棉花增产任务，在今年显得特别重要。
    怎样完成今年棉花的增产任务呢？要努力提高单位面积产量，也要保证一定的植棉面积。既然提出了提高单位产量是增产棉花的主要方法，为什么又必须保证计划规定的植棉面积呢？要知道，棉花的单位产量，只能随着物质条件（如水利、农药、肥料、农具等）和技术条件的改善而逐步提高，决不是听凭人们的意志，想提高多少，就能提高多少。为了保证棉花总产量计划的完成，就必须有一定的棉田面积作为可靠的基础。有的人认为，在我这个地区，棉花的播种面积虽然小于国家的要求，但只要单位产量高于国家要求，总产量也可以达到国家的要求。实际上，这样做是靠不住的。1957年棉花单位产量指标要比1956年增加五斤，比丰收的1955年增加一斤多；在保持原有棉田面积的情况下，提高单位面积产量的任务就已经是相当艰巨的了。从今年的条件和棉田计划面积看，今年的增产要求是积极而可靠的。如果缩小了棉田面积，为了达到棉花总产量指标，势必再提高单位面积产量的指标，使原定的积极可靠的指标变成积极而不可靠的指标。根据过去几年的情况看，我们还不能完全控制自然条件，棉花的单位产量是不稳定的。1952年是个丰收年，单位产量是三十一点二斤；1953年下降为三十点二斤；1954年灾情重，单位产量降至二十六斤；1955年又是个丰收年，单位产量达三十五点一斤；1956年又下降到1952年的水平。由此可见，如果以为只要争取提高棉花单位产量，就可以不按国家计划保证一定的植棉面积，那实际上是一种冒险。这件事同全国人民生活有极密切的关系，这个险是冒不得的！
    有些人片面地过分地强调优先发展粮食生产，或者只顾满足农业社社员的需要，不顾国家计划，随意缩小棉田，或者形式主义地对待播种面积计划——在不好的土地上种棉花。这也是不对的。缩小面积会使增产任务的完成失去可靠的保证，把棉花种在不宜生长的土地上，虽保证了播种面积，但也同样不能保证总的增产任务的完成。这后一种办法，不只是一种冒险，实际上是欺人自欺的一种做法。这样做，究竟对谁有好处呢？
