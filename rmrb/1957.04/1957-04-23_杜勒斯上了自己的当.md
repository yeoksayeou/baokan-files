Dulles Outsmarted Himself
Cui Qi

Some people who envy the news business might say: "Being a journalist is really free, you can go anywhere in the world." But this statement is not suitable for the "free" American journalists, because a vast territory occupying almost one-fourteenth of the Earth's land area has been declared a no-go zone for American journalists. In August of last year, the U.S. State Department issued an order prohibiting any American journalists from visiting China.

This ban immediately triggered a wave of protests in American public opinion circles. Many American newspapers have been criticizing the State Department for infringing on the right to freedom of the press and demanding that it change this absurd measure. However, despite your thousands of words, it has its own set of rules, and to this day, the U.S. State Department still does not allow any American journalists to come to China.

What is the State Department's reason? Dulles came out to explain: The United States and the People's Republic of China do not have diplomatic relations, and "issuing passports to a country that has not been recognized has never been done before." He also said: The U.S. government has a responsibility to "protect" the safety of American citizens, so it cannot allow these journalists to go to a country with which the United States does not have diplomatic relations. What a "parent official" who "loves the people like his own children"! Unfortunately, those American journalists who want to come to China don't appreciate it at all. On the contrary, they refuted Dulles, because Dulles's words are completely deceptive. From 1917 to 1933, for sixteen years, the United States clearly did not recognize the Soviet Union, but it allowed American journalists to interview in the Soviet Union. These journalists did not suffer any harm in the Soviet Union. Just last year, three American journalists, including William Worthy, also visited China via the Soviet Union, and their bodies were not damaged in any way. So, what exactly does Dulles want to "protect"? People have gained an experience: whenever Dulles says he wants to "protect" someone, then that person is going to be unlucky, because what always follows is the discovery that something belonging to that person or that country or that region suddenly disappears. Dulles wants to "protect" American journalists, so the rights of American journalists to interview and travel freely are deprived. No wonder "New York Times" commentator Reston also angrily replied to Dulles: "We don't care about this kind of 'protection' at all"!

Dulles has also invented another kind of logic. He insisted on linking the issue of American journalists requesting to visit China with the Chinese imprisonment of American criminals. At a press conference not long ago, Dulles said, "They (referring to the Chinese) said they would only release the ten prisoners in jail after American journalists could freely interview in Communist China... I won't fall for that kind of blackmail!" But who exactly won't fall for it? Who has used this method to "blackmail" Dulles? American journalist Sevareid recently said in the American magazine "New Republic": "I have never found any indication that the Communists (referring to China) have ever expressed their willingness to release American prisoners of war in exchange for the United States allowing American journalists to go." It can be seen that Dulles's so-called Chinese "blackmail" is just his own fabrication. Dulles relies on his imagination to describe others as a big fool, and then he proudly declares, "I won't fall for it"! Dulles is determined not to fall for his own trap, this is really a good way to be "smart"!

Who is actually carrying out "blackmail"? It turns out that it is Dulles himself. At another press conference, Dulles said: "If those Americans are released, of course, we will look at this situation (referring to the visit of American journalists to China) differently." Recently, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Murphy said more bluntly: "If all American detainees are released, then the U.S. government may allow American journalists... to visit China." But will the Chinese fall for this kind of blackmail by Dulles and his ilk? They are really daydreaming. The visit of American journalists to China and the Chinese imprisonment of American criminals are two completely unrelated things. Dulles actually wants to use American journalists as a bargaining chip in American diplomacy to bargain with others, which is a great insult to the American press.

The real reason Dulles prevents American journalists from visiting China is the U.S. ruling group's policy of not recognizing China and being hostile to China. In order to maintain this policy, they are afraid that the American public will understand the truth about China. They are especially afraid that if Americans have more contact with the Chinese, it will be even more difficult to prevent other countries from having contact with China. Dulles said that if American journalists are allowed to visit China, then this "example" will have a "dangerous impact in other regions." What is the "danger" that Dulles is talking about? That is to say, if everyone can learn more about the truth about China, the current policies of the U.S. ruling group towards China will become more absurd and isolated.

The U.S. policy of not recognizing China and being hostile to China cannot prevent China's existence and development. But this policy often puts the U.S. ruling group in an embarrassing situation. The issue of American journalists requesting to visit China is just the latest example. As long as Dulles and his ilk stubbornly adhere to this policy, then the difficulties they will encounter will continue to emerge. The result can only be: the U.S. ruling group damages its own interests, and the self-righteous Dulles is still outsmarted himself!

### 杜勒斯上了自己的当

    杜勒斯上了自己的当
    崔奇
    有些羡慕新闻事业的人们也许会说：“做个新闻记者真是自由，世界上不管什么地方都可以去跑跑。”但是，这句话对于“自由”的美国的记者们却是不适合的，因为几乎占地球陆地面积十四分之一的一块辽阔国土已经被宣布为美国记者的禁区了。去年8月，美国国务院发布了一道命令，不许任何美国记者访问中国。
    这个禁令一开头就激起了美国舆论界的抗议风潮。美国许多报刊一直在指责国务院损害了新闻自由的权利，并要求它改变这种荒谬的措施。但是，尽管你有千言万语，他却有一定之规，直到今天，美国国务院还是不许任何美国记者到中国来。
    国务院的理由是什么呢？杜勒斯出来解释说：美国和中华人民共和国没有外交关系，而“向一个没有承认的国家发出护照是从来没有办过的事”。他又说：美国政府有责任“保护”美国公民的安全，所以不能让这些记者到一个同美国没有外交关系的国家去。好一个“爱民如子”的“父母官”啊！可惜的是，那些要求到中国来的美国记者们丝毫也不领情。相反，他们驳斥了杜勒斯，因为杜勒斯的话完全是骗人的。从1917到1933的十六年间，美国明明没有承认苏联，但却曾经允许美国记者到苏联采访。这些记者在苏联并未受到任何危害。就在去年，威廉·沃西等三个美国记者也曾转道苏联访问过中国，他们的身体肤发也未受到任何损伤。那么，杜勒斯所要“保护”的究竟是什么呢？人们得到一条经验：每逢杜勒斯说要“保护”谁的时候，那么谁就要倒霉了，因为随之而来的总是发现属于这个人或这个国家、这个地区的某种东西突然丧失了。杜勒斯要“保护”美国记者，于是美国记者的采访和旅行自由的权利就被剥夺了。无怪乎“纽约时报”的评论员赖斯顿也愤愤地回答杜勒斯说：“我们根本不希罕这种‘保护’”！
    杜勒斯又发明了另外一种逻辑。他硬把美国记者要求访华的问题同中国监禁美国犯人的事情连在一起。在不久以前的一次记者招待会上，杜勒斯说，“他们（指中国人）说要美国记者能够自由采访共产党中国之后才肯释放狱中的十个犯人。……那种讹诈我才不上当！”可是究竟不上谁的当呢？究竟谁用这种办法“讹诈”过杜勒斯呢？美国记者席亚尔最近在美国“新共和”杂志上也说过：“从来没有发现过任何迹象显示出共产党（指中国）曾经表示愿意释放美国被俘人员，而以美国允许美国记者前去为交换条件。”由此可见，杜勒斯所谓中国人的“讹诈”不过是他自己虚构的。杜勒斯依靠他的想像力把别人描写成为一个大傻瓜，然后他自己就自鸣得意地宣布说“我才不上当”呢！杜勒斯决心不上自己的当，这真是自作“聪明”的好办法！
    进行“讹诈”究竟是谁？原来恰恰是杜勒斯自己。在另一次记者招待会上，杜勒斯说过：“如果那些美国人被释放的话，当然，我们会另眼看待这个局势（指美国记者访华事）。”最近，美国副国务卿帮办墨菲说得更露骨了：“如果所有美国被拘人员都获释了，那么美国政府或许会允许美国记者……去访问中国。”但是，杜勒斯之流这种讹诈就会使中国人上当吗？他们真是异想天开了。美国记者访问中国，中国监禁美国犯人，完全是风马牛不相及的两回事。杜勒斯竟想把美国记者当作美国外交的法码，用来同别人讨价还价，这真是对美国新闻界的莫大污辱。
    杜勒斯阻止美国记者访华的真正原因，就是美国统治集团不承认中国和敌视中国的政策。为了坚持这个政策，他们害怕美国公众了解中国的真相。他们尤其害怕，如果美国人同中国人的来往增多了，就会更加没有办法阻止别的国家同中国的来往。杜勒斯说，如果让美国记者访问中国，那么这个“榜样”就会“在其他地区产生危险的影响”。杜勒斯所谓的“危险”是什么？这就是说，如果大家都能更多地了解中国的真相，美国统治集团现行的对中国的政策就会更加变得荒唐而孤立了。
    美国不承认中国和敌视中国的政策，并不能阻止中国的存在和发展。但是这种政策却常常把美国统治集团自己弄得狼狈不堪。美国记者要求访华问题，不过是最近的一个例子而已。只要杜勒斯之流还是顽固地坚持这种政策，那么他们要遇到的难题还会层出不穷。结果只能是：美国统治集团损害美国自己的利益，自作聪明的杜勒斯还是上了自己的当！（附图片）
