    Bise River Northern Section Has Laid Tracks to Gegu
    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Kunming) The Bise River section restoration project of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, which began in August of last year, has laid tracks on the northern section from Bisezhai station to Gegu station by March 30th. It is now continuing to advance towards Luogu station, which is fifty-seven kilometers away from Bisezhai. The southern section's track laying has reached the halfway point at the six-and-a-half kilometer mountain station.
    The pier project for the largest bridge on the Bise River line, the Baizhai Bridge, has also been completed. The reinforcement project for the Hekou Bridge, which spans the Sino-Vietnamese border, was successfully completed in early March.

    本报昆明电　滇越铁路碧河段修复工程，去年8月开工后，北段从碧色寨起于3月30日已铺轨到戈姑车站，现在继续向着离碧色寨五十七公里的倮姑车站推进，南段铺轨到了六公里半的山腰车站。
    碧河线上最大的一座桥——白寨大桥的桥墩工程也已完成。横跨中越边境的河口桥加固工程，已在3月上旬胜利完工。
