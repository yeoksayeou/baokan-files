Poland's Friendly Relations with Asian and African Countries
\tDing Dong

\tIn recent years, Poland has developed friendly relations with Asian and African countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. It has established diplomatic relations with Burma, Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Ethiopia, Greece, Lebanon, Cambodia, Turkey, Japan, and Israel, and has exchanged ambassadors or ministers with many of these countries. After Sudan, Tunisia, Morocco, and Ghana declared their independence, Poland quickly recognized them and sent representatives to congratulate them. Polish government leaders have had frequent contacts and talks with leaders of Asian and African countries. Following visits to Poland by Nehru, Sihanouk, U Nu, Radhakrishnan (Vice President of India), Sadono (Speaker of the Indonesian Parliament), and others, Chairman of the Council of Ministers Cyrankiewicz returned visits to Burma, Cambodia, and India in March of this year. He held cordial and sincere talks on bilateral relations and the current international situation, enhancing mutual understanding and friendship. These activities have not only strengthened Poland's friendly relations with Asian and African countries, but also contributed to the development of the trend of peace and neutrality in Asian and African countries and the promotion of international cooperation.

\tPoland has actively participated in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea and the International Supervisory and Control Commissions in Indochina, making important contributions to the struggle to maintain and defend peace in the Far East. This contribution has also greatly enhanced Poland's international status and rapidly increased Poland's prestige and influence among the people of Asian and African countries.

\tPoland has consistently sympathized with and supported the struggle of Asian and African countries and peoples against colonialism and for national independence. When Egypt announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal and Western countries withdrew their pilots, Poland sent twelve pilots to support Egypt. After Britain, France, and Israel launched the aggression against Egypt, the Polish government issued a statement on November 2 last year, strongly condemning the aggressive acts of Britain, France, and Israel. This action of the Polish people and peace-loving people around the world in supporting the Egyptian people both materially and morally, encouraged the Egyptian people's fighting will and enhanced their confidence in victory and peace.

\tPoland's economic and trade relations with Asian and African countries are also becoming increasingly close. To date, Poland has established trade relations with twenty Asian and African countries, including Turkey, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Burma, Ceylon, Pakistan, Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Morocco, and Tunisia, and has signed one-year or multi-year trade agreements with thirteen of them. Poland's exports to these countries are mainly machinery and equipment, including machine tools, textile machinery, electrical equipment, automobiles, heavy trucks, tractors, etc. Poland imports mainly raw materials from these countries, such as rubber and tin from Indonesia, iron ore from India, cotton from Egypt, Iran, and Turkey, and wheat from Turkey. In addition, it also imports southern specialties from these countries, such as coffee, tea, cocoa beans, pepper, raisins, spices, etc. In recent years, the volume of trade between Poland and Asian and African countries has increased significantly. For example, from 1952 to 1956, the value of Polish exports to India increased from 1.6 million rubles to 50 million rubles, and the value of imports from India increased from 600,000 rubles to 8.67 million rubles.

\tPoland has also established shipping relations with Asian and African countries. Polish ships regularly travel to major ports in Asian and African countries, and most of the goods in Poland's trade with Asian and African countries are carried by Polish merchant ships.

\tPoland has exported complete sets of industrial equipment to Asian and African countries and provided technical assistance, such as supplying equipment to sugar factories, machine tool factories, railway vehicle factories, construction machinery factories, and textile machinery factories in India, and helping Saudi Arabia and Jordan build railways. Poland sends experts to work in these countries, providing comprehensive technical assistance from surveying, designing, installing, to starting and operating. Former President of the Polish Central Statistical and Planning Institute, Lange, was sent to India to help draft the Five-Year Plan and assist India in training technical cadres.

\tPoland and Asian and African countries have exchanged many trade delegations for visits and inspections. In 1956, business people from India, Ceylon, Sudan, and other countries were invited to visit and inspect Poland, as were the Egyptian Minister of Railways and the Burmese Economic Delegation. Poland also sent a delegation headed by the Minister of Foreign Trade to visit India, Syria, and other countries. In order to expand trade with Asian and African countries and make the people of Asian and African countries understand the achievements of Poland's socialist construction, Poland actively participated in international expositions held in Delhi, Damascus, Izmir (Turkey), Casablanca (Morocco), and other places. Poland's exhibits were highly valued and praised at the expositions, playing a positive role in promoting Poland's economic ties with Asian and African countries.

\tPoland's trade with Asian and African countries is conducted on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Many Asian and African countries, due to long-term aggression and enslavement by colonialists, have very backward economies and hope to use their abundant resources to exchange for machinery and equipment to develop their national industries. Therefore, Poland's supply of machinery and equipment and provision of technical assistance to Asian and African countries have been warmly welcomed. The raw materials imported by Poland from these countries are mostly materials that Poland does not produce (such as cotton and rubber) or whose output is insufficient (such as iron ore and wheat), which is also beneficial to Poland's socialist construction.

\tPoland's trade with and assistance to Asian and African countries do not have any conditions attached. At the same time, trade prices are fair and reasonable. Sometimes, in order to take care of the economic difficulties of Asian and African countries, Poland purchases goods from Asian and African countries at prices higher than international market prices and sells goods at prices lower than international market prices.

\tThis economic cooperation between Poland and Asian and African countries, developed on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, helps Asian and African countries consolidate their economic independence and develop their own national industries.

\tPoland's cultural cooperation with Asian and African countries is also developing smoothly. In February and March of last year, a cultural delegation headed by the former Secretary-General of the Polish Committee for Foreign Cultural Cooperation, Wende, visited India and Egypt, respectively, and held symposiums with scientists, writers, and artists from India and Egypt to extensively exchange views on strengthening cooperation in culture, science, and art. The rich and colorful performances given by the musicians in the delegation in various parts of India and Egypt were unanimously praised by the audience. In addition, a Polish art exhibition was held in India, which toured major cities such as Delhi, Calcutta, and Madras. At the same time, an Indian cultural delegation headed by the Deputy Minister of the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Chandha, visited Poland, bringing India's beautiful art and the sincere friendship of the Indian people. Poland also held an Indian art exhibition and screened Indian films. Poland had long established cultural relations with Japan. Japanese pianists Chiyo Nakada, Yaeko Yamane and Mamoru Yanagawa participated in the International Chopin Piano Competition held in Warsaw in 1955. The famous Japanese musicologist Saburo Sonobe and the outstanding theoretical physicist Professor Jiro Maki visited Poland successively and gave several academic lectures in Warsaw and Toru≈Ñ, exchanging experiences with Polish colleagues. The Polish people are also increasingly interested in the situation in Japan. Japanese films were warmly welcomed by the Polish masses when they were shown in Poland. Recently, the Japanese Department was established in the Chinese Department of the University of Warsaw, and many students have signed up to study Japanese language, literature, and history. The Japanese Department maintains close ties with Japanese universities. Poland has also strengthened cultural cooperation with other Asian and African countries. Algeria, Sudan, Jordan, Syria, and other countries have sent students to study at Polish universities, and Cambodia is preparing to send interns to Polish factories to learn technology. These activities have played a significant role in enhancing understanding and friendship between the people of Poland and Asian and African countries.

\tFrom the above, it can be seen that Poland is establishing extensive political, economic, and cultural ties with Asian and African countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and strengthening friendly cooperation, which is conducive to the consolidation of world peace and the promotion of international cooperation. Undoubtedly, this friendly relationship will be further developed.
