Poland's Friendly Relations with Asian and African Countries
\tDing Dong

\tIn recent years, Poland has developed friendly relations with Asian and African countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. It has established diplomatic relations with Burma, Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Ethiopia, Greece, Lebanon, Cambodia, Turkey, Japan, and Israel, and has exchanged ambassadors or ministers with many of these countries. After Sudan, Tunisia, Morocco, and Ghana declared their independence, Poland quickly recognized them and sent representatives to congratulate them. Polish government leaders have had frequent contacts and talks with leaders of Asian and African countries. Following visits to Poland by Nehru, Sihanouk, U Nu, Radhakrishnan (Vice President of India), Sadono (Speaker of the Indonesian Parliament), and others, Chairman of the Council of Ministers Cyrankiewicz returned visits to Burma, Cambodia, and India in March of this year. He held cordial and sincere talks on bilateral relations and the current international situation, enhancing mutual understanding and friendship. These activities have not only strengthened Poland's friendly relations with Asian and African countries, but also contributed to the development of the trend of peace and neutrality in Asian and African countries and the promotion of international cooperation.

\tPoland has actively participated in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea and the International Supervisory and Control Commissions in Indochina, making important contributions to the struggle to maintain and defend peace in the Far East. This contribution has also greatly enhanced Poland's international status and rapidly increased Poland's prestige and influence among the people of Asian and African countries.

\tPoland has consistently sympathized with and supported the struggle of Asian and African countries and peoples against colonialism and for national independence. When Egypt announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal and Western countries withdrew their pilots, Poland sent twelve pilots to support Egypt. After Britain, France, and Israel launched the aggression against Egypt, the Polish government issued a statement on November 2 last year, strongly condemning the aggressive acts of Britain, France, and Israel. This action of the Polish people and peace-loving people around the world in supporting the Egyptian people both materially and morally, encouraged the Egyptian people's fighting will and enhanced their confidence in victory and peace.

\tPoland's economic and trade relations with Asian and African countries are also becoming increasingly close. To date, Poland has established trade relations with twenty Asian and African countries, including Turkey, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Burma, Ceylon, Pakistan, Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Morocco, and Tunisia, and has signed one-year or multi-year trade agreements with thirteen of them. Poland's exports to these countries are mainly machinery and equipment, including machine tools, textile machinery, electrical equipment, automobiles, heavy trucks, tractors, etc. Poland imports mainly raw materials from these countries, such as rubber and tin from Indonesia, iron ore from India, cotton from Egypt, Iran, and Turkey, and wheat from Turkey. In addition, it also imports southern specialties from these countries, such as coffee, tea, cocoa beans, pepper, raisins, spices, etc. In recent years, the volume of trade between Poland and Asian and African countries has increased significantly. For example, from 1952 to 1956, the value of Polish exports to India increased from 1.6 million rubles to 50 million rubles, and the value of imports from India increased from 600,000 rubles to 8.67 million rubles.

\tPoland has also established shipping relations with Asian and African countries. Polish ships regularly travel to major ports in Asian and African countries, and most of the goods in Poland's trade with Asian and African countries are carried by Polish merchant ships.

\tPoland has exported complete sets of industrial equipment to Asian and African countries and provided technical assistance, such as supplying equipment to sugar factories, machine tool factories, railway vehicle factories, construction machinery factories, and textile machinery factories in India, and helping Saudi Arabia and Jordan build railways. Poland sends experts to work in these countries, providing comprehensive technical assistance from surveying, designing, installing, to starting and operating. Former President of the Polish Central Statistical and Planning Institute, Lange, was sent to India to help draft the Five-Year Plan and assist India in training technical cadres.

\tPoland and Asian and African countries have exchanged many trade delegations for visits and inspections. In 1956, business people from India, Ceylon, Sudan, and other countries were invited to visit and inspect Poland, as were the Egyptian Minister of Railways and the Burmese Economic Delegation. Poland also sent a delegation headed by the Minister of Foreign Trade to visit India, Syria, and other countries. In order to expand trade with Asian and African countries and make the people of Asian and African countries understand the achievements of Poland's socialist construction, Poland actively participated in international expositions held in Delhi, Damascus, Izmir (Turkey), Casablanca (Morocco), and other places. Poland's exhibits were highly valued and praised at the expositions, playing a positive role in promoting Poland's economic ties with Asian and African countries.

\tPoland's trade with Asian and African countries is conducted on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Many Asian and African countries, due to long-term aggression and enslavement by colonialists, have very backward economies and hope to use their abundant resources to exchange for machinery and equipment to develop their national industries. Therefore, Poland's supply of machinery and equipment and provision of technical assistance to Asian and African countries have been warmly welcomed. The raw materials imported by Poland from these countries are mostly materials that Poland does not produce (such as cotton and rubber) or whose output is insufficient (such as iron ore and wheat), which is also beneficial to Poland's socialist construction.

\tPoland's trade with and assistance to Asian and African countries do not have any conditions attached. At the same time, trade prices are fair and reasonable. Sometimes, in order to take care of the economic difficulties of Asian and African countries, Poland purchases goods from Asian and African countries at prices higher than international market prices and sells goods at prices lower than international market prices.

\tThis economic cooperation between Poland and Asian and African countries, developed on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, helps Asian and African countries consolidate their economic independence and develop their own national industries.

\tPoland's cultural cooperation with Asian and African countries is also developing smoothly. In February and March of last year, a cultural delegation headed by the former Secretary-General of the Polish Committee for Foreign Cultural Cooperation, Wende, visited India and Egypt, respectively, and held symposiums with scientists, writers, and artists from India and Egypt to extensively exchange views on strengthening cooperation in culture, science, and art. The rich and colorful performances given by the musicians in the delegation in various parts of India and Egypt were unanimously praised by the audience. In addition, a Polish art exhibition was held in India, which toured major cities such as Delhi, Calcutta, and Madras. At the same time, an Indian cultural delegation headed by the Deputy Minister of the Indian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Chandha, visited Poland, bringing India's beautiful art and the sincere friendship of the Indian people. Poland also held an Indian art exhibition and screened Indian films. Poland had long established cultural relations with Japan. Japanese pianists Chiyo Nakada, Yaeko Yamane and Mamoru Yanagawa participated in the International Chopin Piano Competition held in Warsaw in 1955. The famous Japanese musicologist Saburo Sonobe and the outstanding theoretical physicist Professor Jiro Maki visited Poland successively and gave several academic lectures in Warsaw and Toruń, exchanging experiences with Polish colleagues. The Polish people are also increasingly interested in the situation in Japan. Japanese films were warmly welcomed by the Polish masses when they were shown in Poland. Recently, the Japanese Department was established in the Chinese Department of the University of Warsaw, and many students have signed up to study Japanese language, literature, and history. The Japanese Department maintains close ties with Japanese universities. Poland has also strengthened cultural cooperation with other Asian and African countries. Algeria, Sudan, Jordan, Syria, and other countries have sent students to study at Polish universities, and Cambodia is preparing to send interns to Polish factories to learn technology. These activities have played a significant role in enhancing understanding and friendship between the people of Poland and Asian and African countries.

\tFrom the above, it can be seen that Poland is establishing extensive political, economic, and cultural ties with Asian and African countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and strengthening friendly cooperation, which is conducive to the consolidation of world peace and the promotion of international cooperation. Undoubtedly, this friendly relationship will be further developed.

    波兰同亚非国家的友好关系
    丁冬
    近几年来，波兰在和平共处的五项原则的基础上发展了同亚非国家的友好关系，先后同缅甸、印度尼西亚、印度、巴基斯坦、阿富汗、伊拉克、埃及、沙特阿拉伯、也门、埃塞俄比亚、希腊、黎巴嫩、柬埔寨、土耳其、日本、以色列建立了外交关系，与其中许多国家互派了大使或公使。苏丹、突尼斯、摩洛哥、加纳宣布独立后，波兰迅速予以承认，并委派代表前往祝贺。波兰同亚非国家的政府领导人进行了频繁的接触和会谈，继尼赫鲁、西哈努克、吴努、拉达克里希南（印度副总统）、沙多诺（印度尼西亚国会议长）等人访问波兰之后，西伦凯维兹部长会议主席又在今年3月回访了缅甸、柬埔寨和印度，分别就两国关系和当前国际局势问题进行了亲切、诚挚的会谈，增进了彼此的了解和友谊。这些活动不仅加强了波兰同亚非国家的友好关系，而且有助于亚非国家和平中立趋势的发展和国际合作的增进。
    波兰积极参加了朝鲜中立国监察委员会和印度支那国际监督和监察委员会，对维护和保卫远东和平的斗争作出了重要的贡献。这种贡献也大大地提高了波兰的国际地位，使波兰在亚非国家人民中的威望和影响迅速增长。
    波兰一贯同情和支持亚非国家和人民反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的斗争。当埃及宣布苏伊士运河国有化、西方国家撤退领航员的时候，波兰派遣了十二名领航员去支援埃及。英、法、以发动侵埃战争后，波兰政府于去年11月2日发表声明，严厉谴责英、法、以的侵略行为。波兰人民和全世界爱好和平的人民对埃及人民的这种行动上和道义上的支持，鼓舞了埃及人民的斗争意志，增强了埃及人民对胜利和和平的信心。
    波兰同亚非国家的经济和贸易关系也日益密切。到目前为止，波兰与土耳其、埃及、印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、锡兰、巴基斯坦、伊朗、叙利亚、黎巴嫩、苏丹、沙特阿拉伯、约旦、阿富汗、埃塞俄比亚、摩洛哥、突尼斯等二十个亚非国家建立了贸易关系，与其中十三个国家签订了一年或多年的贸易协定。波兰向这些国家出口的主要是机器设备，包括工作母机、纺织机器、电器设备、汽车、重型卡车、拖拉机等。波兰从这些国家入口的大都是原料，如印度尼西亚的橡胶和锡，印度的铁矿砂，埃及、伊朗、土耳其等国的棉花，土耳其的小麦等。此外，还从这些国家输入南方的特产品，如咖啡、茶叶、可可豆、胡椒、葡萄干、香料等。近年来，波兰同亚非国家的贸易额有了很大的增长。例如，从1952年到1956年，波兰向印度输出的商品价值由一百六十万卢布增为五千万卢布，从印度入口的商品价值自六十万卢布增为八百六十七万卢布。
    波兰也同亚非国家建立了航运关系。波兰的船舶经常来往于亚非国家的主要港口，波兰同亚非国家贸易中的货物大部分由波兰商船承运。
    波兰已经向亚非国家输出成套工业设备，提供技术援助，如供给印度糖厂、母机工厂、铁路车辆工厂、建筑机器厂、纺织机器厂等的设备，帮助沙特阿拉伯和约旦修建铁路等。波兰派遣专家到这些国家工作，从勘测、设计、安装一直到开工、运转，给以全面的技术援助。前波兰中央统计和计划学院院长兰格被派往印度帮助草拟五年计划，并协助印度培养技术干部。
    波兰同亚非国家互派了许多贸易代表团参观访问。1956年，应邀到波兰参观和考察的，有印度、锡兰、苏丹等国的工商界人士，还有埃及铁道部长和缅甸经济代表团。波兰也派遣了以对外贸易部长为首的代表团去印度、叙利亚等国访问。为了扩大同亚非国家的贸易，使亚非人民了解波兰社会主义建设的成就，波兰积极参加了在德里、大马士革、伊士麦（土耳其）、卡萨布兰卡（摩洛哥）等地举行的国际博览会。波兰的展品在博览会上获得了重视和好评，对促进波兰同亚非国家的经济联系起了积极的作用。
    波兰同亚非国家的贸易是在平等互利的基础上进行的。许多亚非国家由于殖民主义者的长期侵略和奴役，经济非常落后，都希望用本国大量出产的物资来换取机器设备，发展本国的民族工业。因此，波兰供应亚非国家的机器设备和提供的技术援助受到了热烈的欢迎。而波兰从这些国家进口的原料，大都是波兰本国不生产（如棉花、橡胶）或产量不敷需要（如铁矿砂、小麦）的物资，因而对波兰的社会主义建设也有好处。
    波兰同亚非国家的贸易和提供的援助，不附带任何条件。同时，贸易的价格是公平合理的。甚至有时为了照顾亚非国家的经济困难，波兰以高于国际市场的价格购买亚非国家的物资，以低于国际市场的价格出售商品。
    波兰同亚非国家的在平等互利的基础上发展起来的这种经济合作，有助于亚非国家巩固自己的经济独立和发展自己民族工业。
    波兰同亚非国家的文化合作也正在顺利地发展着。去年2、3月间，以前波兰对外文化合作委员会秘书长温德为首的文化代表团访问了印度和埃及，分别同印埃两国的科学家、作家和艺术家举行座谈会，就加强文化、科学和艺术等方面的合作广泛地交换了意见。代表团中的音乐家在印、埃各地举行的丰富多采的表演，得到了观众一致的好评。此外，还在印度举办了波兰艺术展览会，这个展览会曾在德里、加尔各答、马德拉斯等大城市巡回展出。同时，以印度外交部副部长钱达为首的印度文化代表团访问了波兰，带去了印度优美的艺术和印度人民真挚的友情。波兰也举办了印度艺术展览会，放映了印度影片。波兰早就和日本建立了文化关系，日本钢琴家中希代子、山根八重子与柳川护等人参加了1955年在华沙举行的国际萧邦钢琴比赛会。日本著名的音乐学家园部三郎和杰出的理论物理学家木杨次郎教授先后访问了波兰，分别在华沙和托伦作了几次学术讲演，同波兰同行交流了经验。波兰人民对日本的情况也日益感到更大的兴趣，日本影片在波兰放映时，受到波兰群众热烈的欢迎。最近华沙大学中文系成立了日文组，有许多学生报名学习日本语文、文学和历史。日文组和日本的大学保持着密切的联系。波兰也加强了同其他亚非国家的文化合作，阿尔及利亚、苏丹、约旦、叙利亚等国选派了留学生到波兰大学学习，柬埔寨准备派实习生到波兰的工厂学习技术。这些活动对增进波兰和亚非各国人民之间的了解和友谊起了很大作用。
    从上述情况看来，波兰正在和平共处五项原则的基础上同亚非国家建立了广泛的政治、经济和文化联系，加强了友好合作，这种合作有助于世界和平的巩固和国际合作的增进。无疑的，这种友好关系还将进一步的发展。
