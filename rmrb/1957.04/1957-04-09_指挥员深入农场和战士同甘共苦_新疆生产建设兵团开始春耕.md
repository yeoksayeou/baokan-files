Commanders Go Deep into Farms, Sharing Weal and Woe with Soldiers
Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps Begins Spring Ploughing
    (Our Newspaper) The soldiers of the various military reclamation farms in Xinjiang are busily sowing early spring crops. This year, the fourteen farms under the Production and Construction Corps in the Manas River Basin will sow a total area of more than 1.1 million mu, an increase of 400,000 mu over last year. The biggest feature of the various farms this year is that the soldiers are full of energy and confidence in striving for a bumper harvest. Based on summarizing last year's production experience, the preparations for spring ploughing are better than in any previous year. The six farms under a certain division accumulated 500 million jin of fertilizer, an average of 1,000 jin of fertilizer per mu. Last year, when cotton fields were infested with pests, the yield of cotton was affected because pesticides and machinery were not delivered in time. This year, pesticides and machinery for pest control have already been delivered to the farms. Last year, each soldier managed an average of more than 20 mu of cotton fields, a high quota that inevitably led to rough farming. This year, the quota for each person to manage cotton fields has been reduced to about 16 mu. In particular, more than 2,000 cadres from the Workers and Peasants' Quick Literacy Middle School and the various division headquarters with rich farming experience have returned to their production posts, strengthening the lineup of the various work stations and work teams.
    Since this spring, the commanders of the Production and Construction Corps have gone deep into the farms and solved many problems in production. Commander Tao Zhiyue is 65 years old this year, and he has inspected the fourteen farms here in the past two months. Whenever he goes to a farm, he talks to male and female soldiers planting various crops, tractor drivers, breeders, and young reclamation team members, and sometimes he lives in the soldiers' dormitories. Because the commanders went deep into the work teams, they greatly encouraged and enlightened the soldiers.

    指挥员深入农场和战士同甘共苦
    新疆生产建设兵团开始春耕
    本报讯　新疆各军垦农场的战士们正在紧张地播种早春作物。今年，玛纳斯河流域生产建设兵团所属十四个农场播种面积共一百一十余万亩，比去年增加了四十万亩。各农场今年最大的特色是战士们精神饱满，充满了争取丰收的信心。在总结去年生产经验的基础上，春耕准备工作胜过以往任何一年。某师所属六个农场，积肥达五亿斤，平均每亩可上肥一千斤。去年，当棉田发生虫害时，因为药械没有及时运到，影响了棉花产量。今年，除虫的药械早已运到各农场。去年，每个战士平均管理二十多亩棉田，定额偏高，不免耕作粗放。今年，每个人管理棉田的定额已经减到十六亩左右。特别是工农速成中学和各师师部二千多位有丰富耕作经验的干部重新回到了生产岗位，加强了各作业站和工作队的阵容。
    今春以来，生产建设兵团的指挥员深入农场，解决了生产上的许多问题。司令员陶峙岳将军今年六十五岁了，他在最近两个月内，检查了这里的十四个农场。每当他到一个农场，便找种植各种作物的男女战士、拖拉机手、饲养员和青年垦荒队员谈话，有时他就住在战士的宿舍里。由于指挥员深入到工作队，大大鼓舞和启发了战士。
