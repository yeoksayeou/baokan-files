    Written Before the Visit of Polish Distinguished Guests to China
    Zhu Shiqing
    The Polish government delegation, led by Polish Council of Ministers Chairman Józef Cyrankiewicz, bid farewell to Warsaw, the Polish capital, on March 16th and boarded the world-renowned Soviet Tu-104 jet airliner for a friendly visit to seven Asian countries, including China. The combined area of these countries is over 15 million square kilometers, with a population of over one billion. Such a visit is unprecedented in Poland's diplomatic relations. Poland attaches great importance to this visit, especially the visit to China, to which it attaches great significance.
    Before leaving Poland, Cyrankiewicz told representatives of the Polish Press Agency and Polish Radio that the Polish government delegation's visit to Asian countries was a journey of friendship, peace, and cooperation.
    Cyrankiewicz has eloquent talent. When Poland held parliamentary elections in January this year, the Polish United Workers' Party organ "People's Tribune" wrote: "All of Poland knows that Józef Cyrankiewicz is an energetic Chairman of the Council of Ministers, maintaining the composure of a statesman in the most difficult and complex times of national life. In the parliament hall, he is not only the Chairman of the Council of Ministers but also an excellent member of parliament. His speeches in the parliamentary forum always avoid dry and tedious rhetoric, and often demonstrate wit, charm, and the talent of a skilled speaker." In Poland, I have heard his loud and engaging speeches more than once at gatherings and on the radio, with a strong and rhythmic tone that is truly captivating.
    I still remember the scene when Premier Zhou visited Poland for the second time in January this year. People braved the biting cold wind and severe snow, and turned out in droves to welcome the distinguished Chinese guests. They surrounded them, vying to offer flowers and shake hands, singing the familiar and well-known folk song "May He Live a Hundred Years Among Us," wishing the guests longevity. This kind of friendship always gives people deep and beautiful memories. During this visit, Cyrankiewicz accompanied the distinguished guests to visit Krakow, the ancient cultural city of Poland, because Cyrankiewicz's youth and his earliest political speeches were closely related to this ancient city.
    The Polish people, with their long cultural tradition, feel a great interest in China, which has an ancient civilization. When you talk to a Polish friend, he will ask you a series of questions about China like a string of firecrackers. Our song and dance troupe, acrobatics troupe, exhibitions, and the performance of young Chinese pianist Fu Cong, who is studying in Poland... are all highly regarded in the hearts of the Polish people. Many Polish friends write letters or personally seek out Chinese friends to learn about the situation in China or ask to go to China. You can often read news or reports about new China in newspapers and magazines.
    The Polish people are very warm and kind. Anyone who has been to Poland will deeply feel this. Our hundreds of international students live with them and get along quite harmoniously. Polish comrades always regard the Chinese people as close as their own brothers or good friends. Once, I was talking to a Polish friend I didn't know in Polish. Before I could say two or three sentences, he clasped my hands tightly and said, "I don't like you using 'pan' to address me (the most polite pronoun in Polish, meaning 'you'). Please change to 'Ty' (this word is used among the closest and most familiar people)!" What deep and simple friendship is contained in this simple request! Yes, the friendship between the Chinese and Polish people is deep and sincere. The visit of the Polish government delegation to China will bring this friendship of the Polish people from afar to the Chinese people, and they will also bring back the cordial greetings and warm care of the Chinese people to our fraternal Polish people.

    写在波兰贵宾访华之前
    朱士清
    由波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹率领的波兰政府代表团3月16日辞别了波兰首都华沙，乘世界驰名的苏联图—104喷气式客机，去亚洲七国包括我国在内进行友好访问。这些国家的面积连在一起约一千五百多万平方公里，人口在十亿以上。这样的访问在波兰的外交关系上是史无前例的。波兰国内非常重视这次访问，特别是对中国的访问赋予了巨大的意义。
    西伦凯维兹在离开波兰之前曾向波兰通讯社和波兰广播电台的代表说，波兰政府代表团此次赴访亚洲诸国乃是友谊、和平、合作之行。
    西伦凯维兹有着雄辩的口才。今年1月间波兰举行议会大选的时候，波兰统一工人党机关报“人民论坛报”写道：“全波兰都知道约瑟夫·西伦凯维兹是精力充沛的部长会议主席，在国家生活最困难最复杂的时候保持政治家的镇静，在议会大厅里他不仅是部长会议主席，而且也是出色的议员，他在议会论坛上的演说总是避免枯燥无味的词藻，而经常表现出机智、神韵、熟练的演说家的天才。”我在波兰曾不止一次地在集会上、广播中听到过他那响亮引人的演说，语调强烈而有节奏，真是扣人心弦。
    现在我还记得今年1月周总理第二次访问波兰时的情景，人们不顾刺骨的寒风、严凛的大雪，万人空巷地欢迎中国贵宾，他们围着争着献花、握手，唱着亲切的家喻户晓的著名民歌“让他在我们中间活一百年”，祝客人们长寿。这种友情永远给人以深深的美好的回忆。在这次访问中，西伦凯维兹陪同贵宾一起参观了波兰的文化古城克拉科夫。因为西伦凯维兹的青年时期和他最初的一些政治演说与这古老的城市有着密切的联系。
    有着悠久文化传统的波兰人民对有着古老文明的中国感到非常大的兴趣，他们渴望知道关于中国的一切。当你和波兰朋友交谈时，他会像放连珠炮似地向你提出一连串有关中国的问题。我们的歌舞团、杂技团、展览会、在波兰学习的青年钢琴家傅聪的演奏……在波兰人民的心目中都有着不低的评价；有不少波兰朋友写信或亲自找中国朋友了解中国的情况或则要求到中国去。在报刊上你经常会读到有关新中国的消息或通讯。
    波兰人民是非常热情的、亲切的。凡是到过波兰的人都会深深地感受到这一点。我们上百位的留学生跟他们生活在一起，处得相当融洽。波兰同志总是把中国人民看得同自己的亲兄弟或好朋友那样的亲密。有一次，我跟一位不相识的波兰朋友用波兰语交谈，谈不上两三句，他就双手紧握着我的手说：“我不喜欢你用pan来称呼我（波文中尊重对方最客气的代名词，意思是您），请你改用Ty吧（这个字是在最亲热最熟识的人之间用的）！”在这简单的恳求中蕴含着多么深厚纯朴的情谊啊！是的，中波人民之间的友谊是深厚的、真挚的。波兰政府代表团的访问中国将把波兰人民的这种友谊从万里之外的远方带给中国人民，他们也将把中国人民亲切的问候和热情的关怀带回给我们兄弟的波兰人民。　（三月二十日寄自华沙）（附图片）
