Xinhua News Agency, Sanmenxia, April 13th. The Sanmenxia water control project, a focus of national attention for harnessing and developing the Yellow River, officially began construction today.

This morning, a grand opening ceremony was held on Guimen Island in the middle of the Yellow River at Sanmenxia and on the hillside on the south bank of Henan. The rostrum was on Guimen Island, facing the Zhongliu砥柱 [Pillar in the Midstream], standing firm in the rapids. On both sides of the stage hung a couplet that read, "Eradicate water disasters and develop water conservancy." Tall slogan towers, colorful flags, huge diagrams of the dam, bright sunshine, rushing river water, and the mottled rocks on both sides of the river valley reflected each other, making the venue appear particularly grand and beautiful. On the Lion's Head rock on the south bank opposite Guimen Island, where the eight characters "峭壁雄流鬼斧神工" [Sheer cliffs, majestic currents, supernatural craftsmanship] were originally engraved, there was also a couplet, reading "The day of eradicating water disasters is in sight; the Yellow River will be clear in time."

More than 5,000 people attended the opening ceremony, including employees of the Sanmenxia Engineering Bureau, farmers near the dam site, responsible persons from relevant central departments and Gansu, Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Henan provinces, representatives of party and government organizations from Shan County, Henan Province, and Pinglu County, Shanxi Province, where the dam site is located, and Soviet experts who are helping our country with the design and construction of the Sanmenxia project.

At 9:45 a.m., the opening ceremony began with the sound of the national anthem accompanied by the roaring waves.

Liu Zihou, Director of the Sanmenxia Engineering Bureau, delivered a speech. He first expressed his gratitude to the Soviet experts for their help and to the people of the whole country for their support. Then, he gave an overview of the scale and significance of the Sanmenxia water control project. He said that the construction policy this year is to emphasize both the main project and the preparatory work. This year, 400,000 cubic meters of rock excavation will be carried out for the dam foundation on the left bank, the first phase of the cofferdam will be built, and part of the construction of the Lingbao sand and gravel screening plant, the installation of the concrete mixing system, and the construction of highways, railways, power supply, water supply, and other corresponding ancillary enterprises will be completed. He called on all employees to resolutely implement the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy in the country during construction and to carry out the advanced producer movement.

Speeches were then delivered by Fu Zuoyi, Vice Chairman of the Yellow River Basin Planning Commission and Minister of Water Resources; Pokh, a representative of the Soviet experts; Deng Baoshan, member of the Yellow River Basin Planning Commission and Governor of Gansu Province; Xie Huaide, Deputy Governor of Shaanxi Province; Wu Zhipu, Governor of Henan Province; Zhang Wenyi, a representative of the workers; Chai Shufan, Vice Chairman of the State Planning Commission; Wang Lin, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry; You Ben, Deputy Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Agricultural, Forestry and Water Conservancy Trade Union; Qiao Fengshan, Director of the Shanxi Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau; Zhao Mingfu, Deputy Director of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission; Wang Huzhen, Chief Engineer of the Sanmenxia Engineering Bureau; and representatives of local governments, farmers, and young workers at the construction site.

Fu Zuoyi said, "We are now undertaking such a project to turn the water disasters of thousands of years into water conservancy, which can only be done under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party." He also excitedly shook hands with Pokh, the representative of the Soviet experts, to express his gratitude and paid tribute to the workers participating in this project. He called on the people in the middle reaches of the Yellow River to do a good job in soil and water conservation, and the people in the lower reaches to continue to strengthen the work of repairing dikes and preventing floods.

Soviet expert representative Pokh spoke, expressing their enthusiasm and joy in helping the Chinese people develop and harness the Yellow River, and talked about the Soviet government's designation of the best engineers to participate in the design of the Sanmenxia project. Finally, he shouted "Let the Chinese people's ideals of all these years be realized," "Let the Sanmenxia water control project become a symbol of creative and peaceful labor not only in China but also in the world."

The governors of the provinces unanimously stated in their speeches that they would mobilize the people to do a good job in soil and water conservation and resettlement work to support this project. Wu Zhipu especially said that the people of Henan are particularly excited and encouraged by the start of this project because they have suffered from the Yellow River water disasters in the past and will benefit from it in the future. The people of Henan must be at the forefront of the support team. The speeches by the worker representatives and youth representatives all expressed their willingness to dedicate their wisdom and labor to the great cause of taming the Yellow River.

After the representatives' speeches, the young male and female workers presented more than 20 letters of guarantee for increasing production and practicing economy, over-fulfilling the plan, and safe production to the Party. Liu Zihou, Secretary of the Sanmenxia Committee of the CPC, and Deputy Secretaries Zhang Haifeng and Wang Huayun accepted these letters of guarantee. Then, the rostrum announced that nearly 900 congratulatory letters had been received from all over the country; and read out the congratulatory telegrams from the Leningrad Branch of the Soviet Hydroelectric Power Design Institute and the Yellow River Basin Planning Commission and other departments.

At 12:55 p.m., Liu Zihou, Director of the Sanmenxia Engineering Bureau, issued the order to start construction. At this time, explosions rang out continuously under Renmen Island on the left bank, rock fragments flew, and smoke and dust drifted with the wind. The great Sanmenxia water control project officially began construction. (Attached pictures)

    征服黄河的开端
    举国瞩目的三门峡水利枢纽工程正式开工
    峡谷里响起爆炸的轰鸣，从此，人们要在这里凿开峭壁，拦住洪流，使千年为害的黄河永远为人民造福
    新华社三门峡13日电　举国瞩目的治理和开发黄河的三门峡水利枢纽工程今天正式开工了。
    上午，隆重的开工典礼在三门峡河中间的鬼门岛和河南岸的山坡上举行。主席台在鬼门岛上，面对着屹立在激流中的中流砥柱。台上两旁悬挂着“根治水害、开发水利”的对联。高大的标语塔、彩色的旗帜、巨幅的大坝示意图、明媚的阳光、奔腾的河水和河谷两岸斑驳的岩石辉映着，使会场显得格外的雄伟和美丽。和鬼门岛相对的南岸狮子头的岩石上，原刻着“峭壁雄流鬼斧神工”八个大字的地方也有一副对联，写着“根治水害有日，黄河变清有期”。
    参加开工典礼的有三门峡工程局的职工，坝址附近的农民，中央有关部门和甘肃、陕西、山西、河南等省的负责人，坝址所在地的河南省陕县和山西省平陆县的党政机关代表，和帮助我国进行三门峡工程设计和施工的苏联专家共五千多人。

    傅作义说：“我们现在举办这样一个工程，把千百年来的水害变成水利，只有在中国共产党的领导下才能办到。”他还兴奋地和苏联专家代表波赫热烈握手表示感谢，向参加这次工程建设的职工表示敬意。他号召黄河中游地区的人民作好水土保持工作，下游地区的人民继续加强修堤防洪工作。
    苏联专家代表波赫讲话，表示他们对于帮助中国人民开发治理黄河的热情和喜悦，讲了苏联政府指定最优秀的工程师参加三门峡工程的设计的经过。最后他高呼“让中国人民历年来的理想实现”、
  “让三门峡水利枢纽不仅在中国，而且在全世界成为有创造性的和平劳动的象征”。
    各省省长在讲话中一致表示要发动人民，作好水土保持和移民等工作来支援这个工程。吴芝圃特别说，河南人民由于过去身受黄河水害今后又将先得其利，因而对于这个工程的开工特别兴奋鼓舞，河南人民一定要走在支援队伍的最前列。职工代表和青年代表的讲话，都表示要把自己的智慧和劳力献给伟大的治黄事业。
    代表讲话结束后，男女青年职工将二十多份增产节约、超额完成计划、安全生产的保证书献给党，中共三门峡委员会书记刘子厚和副书记张海峰、王化云接受了这些保证书。接着，主席台宣布，已经收到全国各地的贺信近九百封；并宣读了苏联水力发电设计院列宁格勒分院和黄河流域规划委员会等部门的贺电。
