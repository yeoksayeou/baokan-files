    Collecting Herbs in the Min Mountains
    Kong Fanzuo

    In Pingwu County, situated in the Min Mountains of Sichuan, I spent over a month, traveled more than a thousand li, and visited fourteen townships and many villages. The numerous stories people here told me, and the many situations I witnessed firsthand, changed my previous impression of mountainous areas being barren and the people poor. Now, I can tell my friends: This is a rich mountainous area.

    In the Tibetan region of Pingwu County, Cai Zixiu, the district chairman, said to me: "Don't underestimate this place just because the mountains are high, the roads are steep, and there are many wild animals. The wild grasses, tree bark, musk from the musk deer, and monkey bones are all treasures. They become valuable as soon as they are transported out!" He pointed to the mountain behind the district government and said: "This mountain has *Duhuo*, *Dangshen*... Most of the Chinese medicinal herbs sold in pharmacies can be found here, lacking only a few." I quickly asked them about what I had heard: I heard that a farmer here in 1956 trapped more than twenty musk deer and made more than eight hundred yuan just from selling musk. Is it true? A county committee member who was leading the democratic reform of Tibetan farmers here replied in a master-like tone: "Of course, it's true. Do you think this is a rare thing! There are even more surprising things!" Then, he told me: In the Sê'êr tribe, which belongs to this Tibetan region, there are only a little over a hundred households in total. They dug more than a thousand catties of fritillary bulbs in just a few days. Calculated at the average price of ten yuan per catty, it's worth a total of ten thousand yuan. They also dug twenty thousand catties of *Danggui*, calculated at seventy cents per catty, worth a total of fourteen thousand yuan. The two items together total twenty-four thousand yuan. The average income per household is around two hundred yuan.

    Digging medicinal herbs in the mountains is not like harvesting crops in the fields, where it is easy to take them home. Here, every herb digger endures countless hardships. Let me talk about how they dig up the herbs.

    Xie Guodi, a member of the Shuijing Agricultural Cooperative in the Han area, and his partners, each carried thirty to forty catties of corn flour and set off to dig herbs in the mountains. As soon as they left, they started climbing mountains, and it took them three days to reach Huangcaoping. This mountaintop is covered with weeds, stretching endlessly. The sun in the sky was like a fire roasting the travelers' backs, and they couldn't find a drop of water to drink anywhere. Suddenly, the weather changed, and a white rain like hail came, making these people, who had nowhere to hide, feel the cold. This is the climate test that herb diggers must endure.

    In the mountains, there are no herbs where there are roads, and no roads where there are herbs. Xie Guodi and his partners lost their way in the wilderness. What to do? Suddenly, they saw wild boar tracks. Wild boars eat medicinal herbs, so they followed the wild boar paths. But they understood the nature of wild boars. Large wild boars weighing seven or eight hundred catties can be very dangerous when they charge with a group of boars. They walked while being on tenterhooks. Even the sound of wind blowing through the branches made them look carefully, fearing the arrival of wild boars. At the end of the wild boar path, they discovered leopard droppings; and upon further inspection, they found the leopard's den nearby. Fortunately, the leopard was not at home, so Xie Guodi and his partners turned around and ran. Before they could reach a safe place, they were blocked by a steep rock. How anxious they were! In times of urgency, wit is born. Xie Guodi saw countless small holes on the cliff, like traces left by past repairs of plank roads. They used stone slabs, wedging half of them into the small holes, and climbed up while holding onto the stone slabs. The slightest carelessness could lead to the danger of falling. You can't dig up herbs without experiencing dangers. Xie Guodi and his partners finally found fritillary bulbs and dug up more than ten catties to bring back.

    Wild medicinal herbs do not require artificial cultivation, but the experience of digging them is much more difficult than planting them! Relying solely on wild medicinal herbs is also not reliable. The way to change this situation is to change from wild to cultivated. There are many thorny forests, weedy slopes, and lands that produce very little grain here, all of which can be used to grow medicinal herbs, and the harvest is very good. Last spring, the local Party committee and farmers studied the change from wild to cultivated and summarized the experience of individual farmers in planting medicinal herbs in the past, organizing agricultural cooperatives to try planting medicinal herbs according to local conditions. The whole county planted a total of three hundred mu of *Danggui*, *Dangshen*, *Dahuang*, *Wuyu*, and other medicinal herbs, all of which grew very well. The herb diggers praised it endlessly when they saw this scene.

    The Pingwu County Party Committee plans to vigorously develop home-grown medicinal herbs this year. In a year or two, how many valuable medicinal herbs will be produced in the areas where no grain is produced in this mountainous area! This place will no longer be called a barren and poor place but a rich mountainous area!

    岷山采药
    孔繁祚
    在四川岷山上的平武县，我花了一个多月的时间，跑了一千多里路，到过十四个乡、镇和许多村、寨。这里的人们告诉我的许多故事，和我亲眼看到的许多情况，使我改变了过去对山区地瘠民贫的印象。现在，我可以告诉朋友们：这里是富饶的山区。
    在平武县的藏族区，区主席蔡子修对我说：“别看这里山高、路陡、野兽多，这山上的野草、树皮还有獐子的麝、猴子的骨都是宝贝，一运到外面就值钱啦！”他指着区政府背后的山说：“这山上有独活、党参……。中药铺里卖的，这儿大部分都有，缺不了几味药。”我忙把听来的事情问他们：听说这里有一户农民，1956年拴住了二十多头獐子，卖麝香就得了八百多元，是真的吗？在这里领导藏区农民进行民主改革的一位县委委员用主人似的口气回答我：“当然是真的。你以为这算稀奇事吗！还有使你感到稀奇的事哩！”接着，他告诉我：就是这个藏区所属的泗耳部落，总共才一百多户人。他们不多天就挖了一千多斤贝母，每斤以中等价格十元计算，共值一万元。他们还挖了二万斤当归，每斤以七角计算，共值一万四千元。两项合起来是二万四千元。平均每户收入都在二百元左右。
    在山里挖药材，不像在田里割庄稼，很容易就可以收回家。这里，每一个挖药的人，都经过无数的艰苦。让我谈谈他们是怎样把药材挖出来的。
    汉族地区水晶农业社社员谢国弟和他的伙伴们，每人背了三、四十斤玉米面，动身到山上去挖药。一出门便爬山，一连爬了三天，才到了黄草坪。这山顶上长满了荒草，一望无涯；天空的太阳像火似的烘烤着行路人的背，四处找不上一口水喝。忽然，天变了，来了一阵像冰雹似的白雨，又使这些无处藏身的人挨了冻。这是挖药的人必须熬过的气候关。
    在山上，有路的地方没有药材，有药材的地方没有路。谢国弟他们在荒林杂草中迷失了方向。怎么办？忽然看见了野猪的脚迹。野猪是吃药材的，他们便跟着野猪路走去。但他们了解野猪的性格。七、八百斤重的大野猪，带着群猪奔来，人遇上它们是很危险的。一边走，一边提心吊胆。即使是风吹树枝响，也要瞧个明白，怕的是野猪来了。走到野猪路的尽头，发现了豹子屎；再看，那边就是豹子窝。幸好，豹子不在家，谢国弟和伙伴们回头便跑。他们还没跑到安全地方，迎面是一座陡直的岩石挡住了去路。多焦人啊！人急智生，谢国弟瞧见峭壁上有无数的小洞，像过去修栈道遗留下的痕迹。他们便用石板塞一半进小洞内，一边塞，一边抓住石板往上爬。稍有不慎，就有掉下去的危险。不经历艰险是挖不着药的。谢国弟他们终于找到了贝母挖了十几斤回来。
    野生的药材，不需要人工经营，但是挖药材的经历比种药材苦多啦！光靠野生的药材，也是靠不住的。改变这种情况的办法是改野生为家种。这里有着许多刺甲林、荒草坡和出粮食很少的地，都可以种药材，而且收成很好。去年春天，当地党委与农民研究改野生为家种，并总结个别农民过去种药材的经验，组织农业社因地制宜的试种药材。全县一共种了三百亩当归、党参、大黄、吴于等药材，全长的挺好。挖药者看见这情景，都称赞不绝。
    平武县委准备在今年大力发展家种药材。一、两年后，这山区里不出粮食的地方，将要生产多少值价的药材啊！这里不再被人们称为贫瘠穷困之地，而是富饶的山区啦！
