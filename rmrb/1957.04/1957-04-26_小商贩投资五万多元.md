Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 25th: Shanghai vendors Li Mengyu and Shen A'wu, who usually sell Dongting Mountain fruits and fresh fish, learned that some agricultural cooperatives in Zhenze County lacked funds and could not stock enough fish fry. They mobilized more than 300 small vendors in Shanghai, as well as small vendors in Suzhou, Jiaxing, and other places, to raise more than 50,000 yuan. They sent eight representatives to Dong and West Dongting Mountain agricultural cooperatives to lend the funds to the agricultural cooperatives without interest, to be repaid in the autumn. After receiving the funds, the agricultural cooperatives guaranteed that this year's fish fry stocking would be 58% higher than last year.

    小商贩投资五万多元
    据新华社南京25日电  一向靠推销洞庭山水果和鲜鱼的上海商贩李蒙雨和沈阿五等人，知道震泽县有些农业社因为资金不足，不能下足鱼秧的消息，就动员了上海的三百多户小商贩，以及苏州、嘉兴等地的小商贩共同筹集资金五万多元，并派出八个代表把款子送到东、西洞庭山各农业社，以无利投资的方式，借给农业社，秋后归还。农业社在借到资金后，保证今年鱼秧比去年多下58％。
