To Realize the Plan of Increasing Grain Production by 900 to 1.2 Billion Jin, Jiangxi Continues to Promote Agricultural Reform Centered on "Three Transformations"

(Our Newspaper Dispatch) In order to realize the plan of increasing the total grain output of Jiangxi Province this year by 900 million to 1.2 billion jin compared to last year, various localities are actively promoting agricultural reform and technological transformation centered on the "Three Transformations" – transforming one season into two seasons (single-season rice into double-season rice and mid-season rice into early rice, with a season of autumn miscellaneous grain crops interplanted), transforming dry land into paddy fields, and transforming wasteland into cultivated land. According to production plans reported by various localities, the area of double-season rice in the province this year will reach 10 million mu, an expansion of 1.5 million to 2 million mu compared to last year; the planned area for single-season early rice interplanted with autumn miscellaneous grain crops is about 10 million mu, an increase of nearly 1 million mu compared to last year; the area of wasteland reclamation and transformation of dry land into paddy fields has also expanded. More than 1 million mu of wasteland and 300,000 mu of dry land reclaimed last year have been transformed into paddy fields, and grain and other crops can be planted on them this year. Currently, from the southern mountainous areas to the south bank of the Yangtze River, the province has fully launched the work of soaking and sowing early rice. In order to advance the early rice season and strive for a bumper harvest, the soaking and sowing time in various localities is generally five to seven days earlier than last year. Some areas with insufficient labor have adopted the method of soaking and sowing in batches to overcome the difficulty of insufficient labor during transplanting.

This year, all parts of Jiangxi Province have earnestly summarized and accepted the lessons learned from the "Three Transformations" work last year, and further implemented the principle of "overall consideration, active leadership, and adapting to local conditions." This year's "Three Transformations" plan was formulated from bottom to top after full discussion by the masses, and is generally active and reliable. Therefore, agricultural cooperatives in various localities are highly motivated to strive to achieve this plan and strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture.

In addition, agricultural departments in various localities have also particularly strengthened technical guidance to agricultural cooperatives this year. A large number of agricultural technical cadres and agricultural cooperative technicians who have been trained are now imparting experience in technological transformation to members in accordance with local conditions.

The "Three Transformations" were proposed by the leading departments of Jiangxi Province based on the specific conditions of the province's natural conditions and farming system. In Jiangxi Province, the period from "Grain in Ear" (芒种) to "Summer Solstice" (夏至) is the rainy season, and the rainfall is relatively concentrated, accounting for more than half of the annual rainfall, which can easily cause flood disasters. After the "Summer Solstice", there is often a long period of severe drought. In normal years, the province's mid-season and late-season rice suffers a loss of 600 to 700 million jin due to water and drought disasters. Early rice is less susceptible to drought, and its yield is relatively stable. Therefore, transforming mid-season rice into early rice, increasing water conservancy to replant late rice and autumn miscellaneous grains, expanding the land multiple cropping index, and gradually reclaiming and improving red soil wasteland and low-yielding dry land are the main ways to increase production that have been proven in recent years.

    为实现增产粮食九至十二亿斤的计划
    江西继续推行以“三变”为中心的农业改制
    本报讯　江西省为实现今年粮食总产量比去年增产九到十二亿斤的计划，各地正继续积极推行以“三变”——一季变两季（一季稻变双季稻和中稻变早稻复种一季秋季杂粮作物）、旱地变水田、荒地变熟地为中心的农业改制和技术改革工作。根据各地上报的生产计划，今年全省双季稻的面积达一千万亩，比去年扩大一百五十万到二百万亩；计划一季早稻并复种秋季杂粮作物的面积约一千万亩左右，也比去年增加将近一百万亩；开荒和旱地变水田的面积也有扩大，去年开垦的一百多万亩荒地和三十多万亩旱地改成了水田，今年都能种上粮食和其他作物。现在，这个省从南部山区到长江南岸已全面展开早稻浸种和播种工作。为了提早早稻季节争取丰收，各地浸种、播种时间一般都比去年提早了五至七天。一些劳力不足的地区，采用了分批浸种播种的办法，克服插秧时劳力不足的困难。
    今年，江西省各地认真总结和接受了去年推行“三变”工作中的教训，进一步贯彻了“全面考虑、积极领导和因地制宜”的方针。今年的“三变”计划，都是自下而上地经过群众充分讨论制定的，大都积极可靠。因此，各地农业社为争取实现这个计划、力争农业大丰收的劲头很高。
    此外，各地农业部门今年还特别加强了对农业社的技术辅导工作。经过整训的大批农业技术干部和农业社技术员，现在正因地制宜地向社员传授技术改革的经验。
      “三变”是江西省领导部门根据全省自然条件和耕作制度等具体情况提出的。江西省“芒种”后到“夏至”是雨季，雨量比较集中，占全年雨量一半以上，容易造成洪水灾害。而“夏至”以后，又往往长期严重干旱。历年来，在一般正常的年景下，全省中、晚稻因受水、旱灾要损失稻谷六、七亿斤。而早稻受旱较少，产量比较稳定。因此，把中稻变成早稻，并增修水利复种晚稻和秋季杂粮，扩大土地复种指数，以及逐步地开垦和改良红壤荒地、低产旱地，是几年来证明的主要增产门路。
