　　It was a day off. In the morning, my wife and I went to the city together. It was very cold that day, the ground was slippery, and it was quite a distance from the bus stop. My wife and I walked slowly along the road. Along the way, my wife asked this and that, and I told her everything in detail, because she grew up in the countryside, and everything here felt new to her.

　　We were about three li away from the bus station, and we had already walked almost halfway.

　　The north wind mixed with snowflakes constantly hit our faces. I lifted up the collar of my coat and shrunk my head inside... Suddenly, my wife said "Ouch!" I saw her squat down, and I heard her say in a low voice: "I can't, my stomach hurts so much!"

　　"Did you slip?" I asked.

　　"No, my stomach suddenly started hurting," she replied.

　　I helped her to sit down slowly. Only then did I see clearly: she was covering her lower right abdomen with her right hand, crying in pain. It was probably appendicitis. What to do? At this time, although I took off my coat, I still felt hot all over, so I took off my hat too.

　　"Stand up, I'll help you walk slowly."

　　"No, the pain is so bad I can't straighten my back."

　　At this time, I stood blankly by the side of the road, looking around to see if there was a pedicab. After standing for a long time, I told myself: this is a suburban road, where would there be pedicabs! So I turned my hope to the telephone: "If there was a telephone here, I could call the hospital, and they would send an ambulance!" But here, besides a road, there were only vast white fields all around, where would there be a telephone! It seemed that my hope could only be pinned on the bus. So I squatted down again to help her, but alas! She had already lay down, and hot steam was rising from her head.

　　She groaned, feebly groaning.

　　"I'll carry you, carry you to the bus station!" After making this decision, I put my coat on her and carried her and walked.

　　After walking for a short while, suddenly a gust of cold wind flew past me. I fixed my eyes and saw that it was a small black car stopped in front of me. When I walked nearby, two people in green coats came out of the car, both looking to be around forty years old. The tall one was also holding a small red leather bag in his hand, and it seemed that they must be two responsible cadres.

　　"Is the female comrade you're carrying sick?"

　　"Yes, she got sick on the way," I replied. "Oh dear! She looks very serious!" said the other responsible cadre.

　　"Get in our car to the hospital quickly, any later and it might be dangerous!" said the tall responsible cadre.

　　"How can this be, you should take the car!" I said politely.

　　"Get in quickly! What are you hesitating about? Saving a life is the most important thing!" The other responsible cadre seemed to be ordering me.

　　I could no longer refuse and said repeatedly, "Thank you! Thank you!"

　　When my wife and I got into the car, the tall responsible cadre said to the driver: "Send them to the hospital quickly, and then come to the Municipal Committee to wait for us!" After saying that, he looked at his watch and said to the other responsible cadre: "Let's go to the bus station, there's still time."

　　The car drove off, like flying. I stuck my head out of the car window, looking at the two respected responsible cadres, farther and farther away. When I pulled my head back and sat beside my wife, a few crystal tears fell on my clothes.

　　On the way, the driver told me that the tall one was the Party Secretary of the ×× factory east of our residential area, and the other one was the factory director. They were taking the car to the Municipal Committee for a meeting.

　　Twenty minutes passed, and the car arrived at the hospital. After the doctor's diagnosis, it was confirmed to be appendicitis. He said that any later and she could not have been saved.

　　Night, a quiet night.

　　A bright moon, like a silver plate, hung in the sky, and shed her silvery light coolly, shining through the glass window onto my bed. At this time, the scene of the day was replayed in my mind, making it difficult for me to fall asleep for a long time. I thought of those two responsible cadres who share weal and woe with the masses...

　　I seemed to see them again, abandoning their own car to save people, while they themselves were walking step by step in the snow...

    风雪路上 　 古凤山
    这是一个公休天。早晨，我和爱人一起到市里去。这天很冷，地很滑，又兼离公共汽车站较远，我和爱人慢慢地在路上走着。一路上，我爱人问这问那，我都详细地告诉她，因为她是在乡下长大的，这里一切她都感觉新鲜。
    我们离公共汽车站约有三里地，现在已快走一半了。
    北风夹杂着雪花，不时地扑面而来。我将大衣领掀起，把头缩进去，……。忽然，我爱人“哎哟”一声，我看见她已经蹲下，只听她低声说：“不行，肚子疼的要命！”
    “你滑倒了吗？”我问。
    “不是，是肚子骤然疼起来。”她回答。
    我扶着她慢慢地坐下来，这时我才看清：她右手捂着右下边的小腹喊疼，很可能是盲肠炎。怎么办呢？这时我虽然脱下大衣，但仍然感到浑身发热，于是又摘下了帽子。
    “站起来吧，我扶你慢慢走。”
    “不行，疼的直不起腰来。”
    这时，我呆呆地站在马路旁，四下探望着，看看有没有三轮车。站了多时，自己才告诉自己：这里是一条市郊公路，又哪里有三轮车呢！于是把希望又转到电话上：“如果这里要有电话，我可以往医院打电话，他们会来救急车的！”可是这里除了一条公路外，四周都是白茫茫的原野，哪里又有电话呢！看来希望只好寄托在公共汽车上了。于是我又蹲下想扶她，哎呀！她已经躺下了，从她头上冒着热腾腾的白气。
    她呻吟着，无力地呻吟着。
    “背吧，背到公共汽车站！”我这样决定后，把大衣给她披上，就背起来走了。
    走不多时，忽然一阵冷风从我身边飞过，定睛一看，原来是一辆小黑轿车停在我的前面。当我走到附近时，从车内出来两个穿青大衣的人，看样子都有四十上下，那个高个的手里还拿着一个红色的小皮包，看来一定是两位负责干部。
    “你背的女同志有病了吗？”
    “是的，在半道上得的。”我回答着。“哎呀！看样子还很厉害呢！”另一个负责干部说。
    “快坐我们车上医院吧，再迟恐怕有危险！”那位高个负责干部说。
    “这怎能行，还是您坐车走吧！”我礼貌地说。
    “快上去！还迟疑什么？救命要紧！”另一位负责干部像是在命令我了。
    我再不能推辞，连声说：“谢谢！谢谢！”
    当我和我爱人上车时，那位高个负责干部向司机说：“快速送到医院，然后到市委会等我们！”说完看看手表，又和那位负责干部说：“咱们到公共汽车站去，时间还来得及。”
    车开了，像飞的一样。我将头探出车窗，望着那两位敬爱的负责干部，远了，渐渐地远了。当我把头缩回，坐在爱人身边的时候，几颗晶莹的泪珠，落在我的衣襟上。
    在途中司机告诉我，那个高个的是我们住宅区东边那个××工厂的党委书记，另一位是厂长，他们是坐车到市委会开会的。
    二十分钟将过，车子就开到医院了，经医生诊断确定是盲肠炎。他说再晚到一会儿，就不能挽救了。
    夜，静悄悄的夜。
    一轮皎洁的明月，像银盘似地挂在天空，清凉地洒下她的银辉，透过玻璃窗照在我的床上。这时，白天的景象重映在我的脑海里，使我长久不能入睡。我想起了那两位与群众同甘共苦的负责干部……。
    我仿佛又看见了他们抛下自己坐的车子去救人，而自己在雪地上一步一步地走着。……
