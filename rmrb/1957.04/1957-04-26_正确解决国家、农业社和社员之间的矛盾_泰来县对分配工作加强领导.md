Xinhua News Agency, Tailai, 25th – Since the spring, leading organs in Tailai County, Heilongjiang Province, have been paying attention to strengthening leadership over the distribution work of agricultural cooperatives. Now, agricultural cooperatives in the county have, through democratic discussions, determined the distribution system and methods for the summer and autumn seasons this year and have announced them to the members, allowing them to conduct year-round supervision of the distribution work.

Paying attention to distribution work early on, adjusting the contradictions of interests among the state, cooperatives, and members from the distribution link, is a measure taken by Tailai County after learning from past lessons. Last year, the agricultural cooperatives in the county only began to establish accounts two months after their establishment, and financial management gradually lagged behind; in addition, many cooperatives had unsound labor quota systems. During the autumn harvest distribution, many unreasonable phenomena and difficult-to-resolve contradictions arose in terms of remuneration between the cooperative and its members, between production teams, between members, and between members and cadres. A dozen cooperatives have still not completed their final accounting. Many cooperatives adopted the erroneous distribution method of prioritizing members, then the cooperative, and finally the state, which resulted in many members overspending during the final accounting. The entire county has not yet completed the task of grain procurement, and most cooperatives have not repaid the state loans they should have.

This year, in the recently concluded rectification work of the cooperatives throughout the county, education on the consistency of interests among the state, cooperatives, and members was universally conducted. In order to better implement the principle of distribution according to labor within the cooperatives, all cooperatives have implemented the system of contracting work to teams or individuals and setting output quotas, and formulated seasonal and graded labor quota standards. Some cooperatives have also established a labor quality acceptance system to ensure good quota management. Most cooperatives have improved the calculation of workdays, achieving daily recording, short-term settlement, and monthly announcements. Recently, the county People's Committee convened a cooperative accounting work conference to study how to improve this year's financial management and accounting work, laying a solid foundation for distribution work.

In order to solve the difficulty of members lacking pocket money in the middle of the year, the vast majority of cooperatives have established a advance payment system, generally no less than three times, and most cooperatives stipulate that advance payments are issued when members need money during seasonal changes. In order to avoid overspending in advance payments and causing difficulties in the distribution accounting, the County Party Committee decided that the cumulative advance payment for each member throughout the year should generally not exceed one-third of the total annual income.

    正确解决国家、农业社和社员之间的矛盾
    泰来县对分配工作加强领导
    新华社泰来25日电　黑龙江省泰来县的领导机关从春天起就注意加强对农业社分配工作的领导。现在这个县的农业社，已经通过民主讨论把今年夏、秋两季的分配制度和方法确定下来，并向社员公布，让社员对分配工作进行常年监督。
    及早地注意分配工作，从分配这个环节上调整国家、合作社和社员三者之间的利益矛盾，是泰来县接受往年的教训而采取的措施。去年，这个县的农业社建立两个月以后才开始建账，财务管理步步跟不上；加上许多社劳动定额制度不健全，秋收分配中在报酬方面出现了社和社员之间、生产队之间、社员之间以及社员和干部之间许多不合理的现象和不易解决的矛盾，至今还有十几个社没有结束决算。不少社采取了先社员、次合作社、最后给国家的错误分配办法，使得决算时许多社员超支，全县至今也没有完成征购粮任务，多数社没有还清该还的国家贷款。
    今年，全县在最近刚结束的整社工作中，普遍地进行了国家、社和社员三者利益一致的教育。为了在社内更好地贯彻按劳分配的原则，所有的社都推行了包工包产制度，制定了分季分级劳动定额标准。有些社还建立了保证搞好定额管理的劳动质量验收制度。多数社都改进了劳动日的计算工作，做到每天记录、分小段结算、按月公布。最近，县人民委员会又召开了合作社会计工作会议，研究搞好今年的财务管理和账务工作，为分配工作打好基础。
    为了解决社员年中缺少零用钱的困难，绝大多数社都建立了预支制度，一般都不少于三次，多数社都规定在社员换季用钱时发放预支款。为了避免在预支中超支，给分配决算造成困难，中共县委决定，一般的社每个社员全年预支的累计，不应超过全年总收入的三分之一。
