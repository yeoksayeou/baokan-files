Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 23rd: The Hebei Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Work Conference concluded on the afternoon of the 22nd. Over eight days, in accordance with the spirit of the National Propaganda Work Conference, the conference, together with non-Party figures, studied the issue of resolving contradictions among the people, further implementing the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," and comprehensively strengthening the Party's ideological work.

The conference was conducted under the personal direction of Lin Tie, First Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee. It was attended by 1,190 people, including secretaries of various municipal and prefectural party committees, heads of propaganda and cultural departments, and Party and non-Party workers in science and technology, literature and art, and news and publishing. Gathering together, they conducted lively discussions based on the spirit of Chairman Mao's speeches at the Supreme State Conference and the National Propaganda Work Conference. During the conference, Lin Tie and other responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee Secretariat invited figures from the fields of science and technology, education, and literature and art to hold forums. Non-Party figures made sincere and frank speeches with excitement and pleasure, and put forward many opinions and criticisms on various aspects of the Party's ideological work. Finally, Zhang Chengxian, Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, delivered a summary report to the conference on behalf of the Provincial Party Committee.

The conference particularly focused on examining the Party's guiding ideology and work style, emphasizing that the fundamental issue in contradictions among the people is the relationship between leaders and the led, and that the key to correctly resolving contradictions among the people lies in leadership. Therefore, the most important thing is to solve the problems existing in the ideological work style of leaders at all levels within the Party. Only by solving the problem of leadership ideology can we effectively lead ideological work on all fronts and correctly handle contradictions among the people in all aspects. There are now approximately three situations in the province: senior leading cadres, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, have recognized the new changes in the situation, paid attention to adjusting the relationship between leaders and the led, and paid attention to resolving contradictions among the people; general cadres do not yet have a sufficient understanding of the Central Committee's policies and are still in a state of not being fully conscious, and some are still in a blind state. They cannot yet see the changes in the situation, do not clearly distinguish the boundaries of contradictions of various natures, do not answer the many questions raised by the people, are unwilling to listen to opposing opinions, and resort to simple suppression when they cannot convince the masses; and there are still many cadres who have a resistant attitude towards this policy of the Central Committee, they do not see the new changes, and when dealing with problems that occur among the people, they simply believe that there are bad elements causing trouble, some people say that "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" is "unlimited leniency," and some emphasize "legal sanctions." In addition, there are a few people with a bad ideological style who have serious phenomena of violating laws and discipline. There are also those who have a conciliatory attitude towards mistakes and bad phenomena and who adopt an opportunistic ideology of allowing contradictions to arise and perish on their own.

In order to further implement the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," the conference held that it is first necessary to overcome the fear of "letting go" and thus the inability to let go of ideas. It pointed out that the root of this kind of thinking is mainly an insufficient understanding of the changes in the situation and a sectarian view of intellectuals, and therefore they do not dare to let go of various contradictions among the people. It also pointed out that contradictions among the people exist objectively, and suppressing them will not solve them if they are not released for resolution. We should acknowledge contradictions and regard them as the driving force of the development of things, and believe that we have the power to solve them. Facts have proved that during this period, in resolving contradictions among the people, boldly developing democracy, revealing the bottom line and jointly studying solutions to problems with the masses, absorbing correct and reasonable things, resolutely admitting and correcting errors in leadership, and explaining incorrect opinions to distinguish right from wrong will make the people more supportive of the Party's leadership. The conference also criticized certain erroneous ideas, such as some party members and cadres believing that "we let go during the anti-leftist campaign, and we will have to rein things in when we combat rightists in the future", some non-party members believing that "letting go is laying a long line to catch big fish, discovering targets", and fearing that there would be no way to clean up if poisonous weeds were released. This is mainly due to a lack of understanding that the Party's policy is based on recognizing the objective existence of contradictions and solving problems according to the objective laws of the development of contradictions, which is a long-term policy, and that at any time the solution to contradictions among the people can only be this way.

The conference also conducted an examination and study of how to correctly handle contradictions among the people in various departments and how to specifically implement policies such as "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" and "long-term coexistence, mutual supervision" from the perspective of guiding ideology. After the conclusion of the conference, departments such as propaganda, culture and education, and newspapers and periodicals immediately held professional meetings to specifically study measures to be implemented in their respective departments in accordance with the spirit of the conference.

    正确解决人民内部矛盾的关键是什么？
    中共河北省委宣传工作会议进行了热烈讨论
    据新华社保定23日电　中共河北省委宣传工作会议22日下午结束。在八天的时间内，会议根据全国宣传会议的精神，和党外人士共同研究了解决人民内部矛盾，进一步贯彻“百花齐放，百家争鸣”，全面加强党的思想工作的问题。
    会议在河北省委第一书记林铁亲自主持下进行，参加会议的有各市、地委书记，宣传文教部长以及党内外科学技术、文学艺术、新闻出版工作者等一千一百九十人，百家汇于一堂，根据毛主席在最高国务会议和全国宣传会议上讲话的精神，进行了热烈的讨论。会中林铁与省委书记处的各位负责同志分别邀请科学技术、教育、文艺界人士举行了座谈，党外人士都以兴奋愉快的心情作了诚恳坦率的发言，对党的思想工作的各个方面提出了许多意见和批评。最后，由中共河北省委书记处书记张承先代表省委对大会作了总结报告。
    会议特别着重检查了党的领导思想作风，强调指出：人民内部矛盾的根本问题是领导与被领导的关系问题，正确解决人民内部矛盾的关键在于领导。因此，最主要的是解决党内各级领导思想作风上存在的问题。领导思想问题解决了，才能有力的领导各个战线上的思想工作，才能正确的处理各个方面的人民内部矛盾问题。现在全省大约有三种情况：高级领导干部在党中央领导下认识了新的形势变化，注意了调整领导与被领导的关系，注意解决人民内部的矛盾；一般干部对中央的方针认识还不够，还处于不十分自觉的状态，有的还处于盲目状态，他们还看不清形势的变化，对各种性质的矛盾界限划的不清楚，对人民群众提出的许多问题不去解答，不愿听反面意见，说服不了群众就怨群众落后甚至简单压服等等；还有不少干部对中央的这一政策方针存有抵触情绪，他们看不到新的变化，处理人民内部发生的问题时，简单认为有坏分子捣乱，有的人说：“百花齐放，百家争鸣”是“宽大无边”，有的人强调“法律制裁”。此外，还有少数人思想作风恶劣，存在着严重的违法乱纪的现象。也还有的存在着对错误和坏现象抱迁就态度、对矛盾采取听任其自生自灭的机会主义思想。
    为了进一步贯彻“百花齐放，百家争鸣”方针，会议认为：首先要克服怕“放”因而放不开思想。指出这种思想的根源，主要是对形势变化认识不深刻，对知识分子有宗派主义看法，因而对人民内部的各种矛盾不敢放。并指出：人民内部矛盾是客观存在，不放出来去解决它，压是解决不了的。应该承认矛盾，并把它看成是事物发展的动力，相信我们有力量解决它，事实证明，这一时期在解决人民内部矛盾中放手发扬民主，把底亮开与群众共同研究解决问题，正确的合理的东西加以吸收，领导上的错误坚决承认纠正，不正确的意见加以说明，辨明是非，这样人民群众会更拥护党的领导。会议还批判了某些错误思想，如有的党员干部认为“反左时放，将来反右时就要收”、有的党外人士认为：“放是放长线，钓大鱼，发现目标”以及怕放出毒草来没法收拾等，这主要是不了解党的方针是基于承认矛盾的客观存在，按照矛盾发展的客观规律来解决问题，这是长期的方针，任何时候人民内部矛盾的解决办法只能如此。
    会议还对各部门中如何正确处理人民内部矛盾，如何具体贯彻“百花齐放，百家争鸣”“长期共存、互相监督”的方针，从领导思想上进行了检查和研究。大会闭幕后，宣传、文教、报刊等部门紧接着就分别举行专业性会议，根据大会精神，具体研究在本部门具体贯彻执行的措施。
