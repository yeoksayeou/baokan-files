Xinhua News Agency, April 22nd, Bangkok: "Free Communications" newspaper published an editorial on April 18th stating, "The government should not hesitate to withdraw Thai troops from South Korea." The newspaper believes it is unnecessary to consult the United Nations on this matter.

The editorial stated that we have no need to sacrifice Thai lives and money to protect the interests of a certain great power. The editorial revealed that Thailand spent a total of 230 million baht during the Korean War (not including debts owed to the United States), and currently Thailand still has to pay 1.5 million baht each month to maintain the troops stationed in South Korea. The editorial demanded that this money be used for national construction projects.

"Picture News" in its editorials on April 16th and 17th, advocated stopping the repayment of debts owed by Thailand to the United States due to the Korean War. The editorial stated that no one would doubt that the United States was the initiator of the Korean War, and it induced its "allies" to participate in the massacre of innocent Korean people.

The "Motherland" weekly also advocated withdrawing Thai troops from South Korea in its April 15th editorial, and believed that Thailand had no responsibility to pay the debts owed to the United States from the Korean War.

    泰国舆论要求撤回侵朝军队
    并主张停付在朝鲜战争中欠美国的债款
    新华社22日讯　曼谷消息：“自由通讯报”4月18日发表社论说：“政府应当毫不犹豫地从南朝鲜撤回泰国军队”。这家报纸认为，不必要去同联合国商量这件事。
    社论说，我们没有任何必要拿出泰国人的生命和金钱，去保护某一大国的利益。社论透露，泰国在朝鲜战争中共支出了二亿三千万铢（不包括对美国的欠款在内），目前泰国每月还必须付出一百五十万铢用来维持驻在南朝鲜的军队。社论要求将这笔款项用于国家的各项建设。
    “图画新闻”在4月16日和17日的社论里，主张停止偿付泰国在朝鲜战争中积欠美国的债款。社论说，再没有谁会怀疑，美国就是朝鲜战争的发动者，它诱迫它的“盟友”参与屠杀无辜的朝鲜人民。
    “祖国”周刊4月15日的社论也主张从南朝鲜撤回泰国军队，并且认为，泰国没有责任付还在朝鲜战争中欠下美国的债款。
