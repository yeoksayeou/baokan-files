Mobilizing Social Forces to Run Primary Schools
196 Units in Shenyang Do a Good Job

Editor's Note: Up to now, 196 factories, mines, enterprises, universities, colleges, and government organizations in Shenyang have established schools. This not only solves the problem of school enrollment for school-age children of their own units, but also helps the country overcome some difficulties.

Running schools by government organizations and enterprises will inevitably encounter some difficulties, such as the shortage of teachers, school buildings, and funds. However, government organizations and enterprises also have many conditions that can be utilized. If these conditions can be properly utilized, difficulties can be overcome. The establishment of schools by various government organizations and enterprises in Shenyang has provided us with some good methods in this regard. All localities can refer to these methods to appropriately solve the problem of school enrollment for school-age children this year.

This newspaper reports that the number of seven-year-old school-age children in Shenyang this year has increased by 76.3% compared to last year. However, even with the newly built school buildings this year, the city can only accommodate 66.5% of all school-age children, and approximately 20,000 children will not be able to enroll in the new school year.

In order to assist the government in running schools and solve the enrollment problem for these school-age children, factories, mines, enterprises, universities, colleges, and government organizations in Shenyang have done a lot of work. The primary schools established by these units this year can save more than 10,000 children from being out of school. Therefore, the number of school-age children enrolled in the city can be increased from the original plan of 66.5% to over 85%.

The forms of assisting the government in running schools are roughly as follows: The first form is to run primary schools independently. The school-running unit itself undertakes the construction of school buildings or classrooms, and solves the problems of teachers and recurring expenses. The education administrative department provides assistance in teaching and business. There are 13 units that run such independent primary schools, such as Shenyang Railway Signal Factory and Cable Factory. The second form is to run schools jointly. School buildings, funding, equipment, and the like are jointly organized by many units, and a school-running committee is established to assist the government in running schools. There are 21 units that adopt this form, such as Heavy Machinery Factory, Steel Rolling Mill, and Federation of Industry and Commerce. The third form is to run schools jointly with the government. Each unit raises a certain amount of funds to assist the government in building schools. There are 162 units that do this, such as Teachers College and Ceramics Factory.

Factories, mines, enterprises, universities, colleges, and government organizations in Shenyang are running schools based on the principle of diligence and thrift. For example, Shenyang Cable Factory has extracted 14 bungalows in the staff and worker residential area and plans to use them as classrooms for eight first-grade classes of elementary school, which will be able to enroll nearly 400 school-age children inside and outside the factory. Shenyang Red Brick Factory No. 1, Factory No. 2, and United Brick and Tile Factory plan to jointly run six first-grade classes of elementary school, which can enroll more than 670 children. They will use broken bricks from production to build school buildings. The school-running funds of some units are paid under the factory director’s fund and the union’s welfare fund projects.

In order to ensure the realization of these units' school-running plans, the Shenyang Municipal Education Department is actively studying to supplement new teachers. More than 580 graduates of intermediate normal schools and accelerated normal schools in the city will graduate from schools this year. Some staff members drawn from factories and mines and some junior high school graduates this year will also be added to the ranks of primary school teachers. The education department has also unified the setting of the city's education network and assisted in the construction of schools by various units.

As far as Shenyang is concerned, the potential of factories, mines, enterprises, universities, colleges, and government organizations in the city to assist the government in running schools is still very large. If some factories, mines, enterprises, and government organizations fully attach importance to this work, eliminate the concerns about the trouble of "running independently" and the wrangling of "running jointly," and can act more actively, more school-age children in Shenyang will be enrolled this year.

    动员社会力量办小学
    沈阳市一百九十六个单位办法好
    编者按　沈阳市到目前为止，已有一百九十六个厂矿企业、大专学校和机关办学。不仅解决了本单位学龄儿童的入学问题，也帮助国家克服了一些困难。
    机关、企业办学在一定程度上是会遇到一些困难的，譬如师资、校舍、经费的不足等等。但是，机关、企业单位也有很多可以利用的条件。如果能够好好地利用这些条件，困难是可以克服的。沈阳市各机关、企业办学，已经在这方面为我们提供了一些好办法。各地可以参照这些办法，来适当地解决今年学龄儿童入学问题。
    本报讯　本报记者文天申报道：沈阳市今年满七周岁的学龄儿童比去年增加了76.3％。但包括今年新修的校舍在内，全市只能容纳全部学龄儿童的66.5％，大约有二万余儿童将不能在新的学年入学。
    为协助政府办学，解决这些学龄儿童的入学问题，沈阳市的工矿企业、大专学校和机关团体做了很多工作。这些单位今年举办的小学，可使一万余名儿童免去失学之忧。因此全市学龄儿童的入学人数可由原计划的66.5％上升到85％以上。
    协助政府办学的形式大体有以下三种：第一种是自办小学，办学单位自己承担修建校舍或课室，解决师资和经常费用，教育行政部门在教学业务方面予以协助。这样自办的小学有沈阳铁路信号厂、电缆厂等十三个单位。第二种是联合办学，校舍经费设备等由许多单位联合筹办，成立办学委员会协助政府办学。采取这种形式的有重型机器厂、轧钢厂、工商联等二十一个单位。第三种是同政府合办，各个单位筹出一定的经费，协助政府建校，这样做的有师范学院，陶磁厂等一百六十二个单位。
    沈阳市工矿企业、大专学校和机关团体是根据勤俭办学的原则进行办学的。如沈阳电缆厂在职工住宅区抽出了十四间平房，计划用它作为八个初小一年班的教室，将能招收近四百名厂内外的学龄儿童入学。沈阳市红砖一厂、二厂、联合砖瓦厂计划联办六个初小一年级班，约可收六百七十多名儿童。他们将利用生产中的断砖兴建校舍。有的单位的办学经费是在厂长基金、工会的福利费项目下开支的。
    沈阳市教育部门为了保证这些单位办学计划的实现，正在积极研究补充新的师资。全市今年将有五百八十多名中级师范和速成师范的毕业生从学校里出来。厂矿机关抽调部分工作人员和今年部分初中毕业生也将补充到小学教师的队伍中去。教育部门还统一考虑了全市教育网的设置，协助各单位建校工作的进行。
    就沈阳市来说，全市工矿企业、大专学校和机关团体协助政府办学的潜力还很大。如果某些厂矿、企业、机关充分地重视这项工作，清除怕“自办”麻烦，怕“联办”扯皮的顾虑，都能更加积极地行动起来，今年沈阳市就会有更多的学龄儿童入学。
