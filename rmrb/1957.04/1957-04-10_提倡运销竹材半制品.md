    Promote the Transportation and Sale of Bamboo Semi-finished Products
    Mao bamboo is an important building material in our country's large-scale construction. Based on the total allocation of outbound transportation tasks for bamboo-producing provinces by the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, the figure for 1955 was more than 23 million, last year it was 35 million, and this year it will increase even more. Generally, all regions adopt the business method of transporting and selling raw bamboo (i.e., whole mao bamboo). If calculated using a 30-ton capacity railway car, these mao bamboo require 20,000 to 30,000 railway cars annually to transport them from the producing areas to the selling areas. However, the actual use of raw bamboo in the selling areas only accounts for about half of the total amount of raw bamboo purchased. The other half could be processed in the producing areas according to the needs of the selling areas into various bamboo products and semi-finished products, and then loaded onto railway cars for transport to the selling areas, without having to load and transport the whole bamboo from the producing areas. Because of the whole bamboo transport, it wastes at least 10,000 railway cars of the nation's transportation capacity annually, wasting approximately 10 million yuan of national funds. Therefore, making bamboo into semi-finished products in the producing areas has many benefits:
    First, the loading capacity of railway cars carrying bamboo products and semi-finished products is two to four times higher than that of railway cars carrying raw bamboo, thus saving about 7 million yuan in transportation costs and saving the transportation energy of more than 10,000 railway cars.
    Second, the labor wage level in mountainous areas of producing regions is low, and the cost is cheaper. The vast majority of farmers can process bamboo products and semi-finished products, as well as some simple bamboo utensils such as bamboo scaffolding. Handicraft industries in the selling areas can also expand production and reduce costs by buying bamboo and semi-finished products from the producing areas.
    Third, market resources are expanded, and the tense situation can be eliminated.
    Therefore, I hope that relevant departments will take effective measures to solve this problem.

### 提倡运销竹材半制品

    提倡运销竹材半制品
    毛竹是我国大规模建设中的一项重要建筑材料。根据全国供销合作总社分配各产竹省份外调任务推算，1955年为二千三百多万根，去年为三千五百万根，今年将增加更多。各地一般都采取原竹（即整根毛竹）运销的经营方式。如以载重三十吨的车皮计算，这些毛竹从产地运到销地，每年要用二万到三万个车皮。而销地实际使用原竹仅占采购原竹总量的一半左右，其余一半本可在产地根据销地需要加工为各种竹材制品、半制品，再行装车运往销地，不必从产地整根装车运出。因为整装运输，每年至少浪费国家一万个车皮的运输能力，浪费国家资金在一千万元左右。所以在产地把竹材做成半制品，有许多好处：
    第一，竹材制品、半制品车皮装载量较原竹车皮装载量高出二至四倍，因而可以节约运费七百万元左右，节省一万个以上的车皮运输能量。
    第二，产区山区劳动工资水平低，成本便宜。竹材制品、半制品以及一部分简单竹器如竹跳板之类，广大农民都可加工。销地手工业从产地买到竹材和半制品，也能扩大生产，降低成本。
    第三，市场资源扩大，紧张状态可以消除。
    因而，我希望有关部门采取切实有效的措施解决这一问题。
