    Weak Links of Two Leaders
    Chen Nengkuan, Researcher, Institute of Applied Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences

    Two main aspects of good scientific leadership: how the Party helps scientists improve their ideological level; how scientists help the Party grasp scientific knowledge.

    Does natural science need leadership? Most scientific workers would answer in the affirmative. Because without leadership, even in our present excellent society, although individual great scientists would still emerge, it is obvious that individual great scientists, however valuable, cannot solve all the problems. In today's highly specialized science, comprehensive construction, especially rapid construction, is impossible without planned leadership. Therefore, Party leadership of scientific undertakings is in line with the heartfelt wishes of the vast majority of scientific workers.

    However, the characteristics of natural science development determine the special leadership methods required. In the past thirty years, because the Party's full energy was devoted to leading the revolution, it was impossible to study natural science, nor could it become familiar with the characteristics of every science in a short period. This gave some people the impression that the Communist Party is good at politics but not at natural science, thus raising doubts about whether the Party can lead science. I think that people with this view seem to be drawing conclusions prematurely and unfairly. Personally, I feel that a Party that has mastered dialectical materialism is itself a scientific organization. By inference, such an organization, which can lead class struggle and achieve victory, should also be able to lead the struggle against nature. This is easy to believe.

    The most important thing in leading science is to pay attention to methods, and the most important of these is to seek truth from facts and not pretend to know what you do not know. The most taboo is dogmatism that departs from dialectical principles, mechanically applying leadership methods from other fields. Personally, I believe that as long as the leadership methods conform to the spirit of seeking truth from facts, the content of leadership and what to lead should change with the development of the situation, without predefined categories. This is a supplement to my opinion on Comrades Tu Changwang and He Guozhu (see People's Daily, April 17, 1957, page 7). Furthermore, since the Party's leadership is for promoting scientific undertakings and does not mean interfering, controlling, or being a figurehead, it should lead as much as possible and learn more where it cannot yet lead.

    The tremendous achievements of China's scientific undertakings since liberation eloquently demonstrate that the Party is not an amateur in scientific leadership. What methods did the Party's top leaders use? The Party issued a resounding call to march towards science, paid special attention to respecting and educating scientists, organized scientists to formulate a twelve-year science plan, and recently proposed the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend. These leadership methods have deeply impressed me as being the most creative. Written as a formula, it is: The Party leads the scientists, and the scientists lead science. That is to say, the Party leads science through the scientists.

    Using this formula, the current shortage of scientists within the Party is compensated for. In the future, even if there are more Party member scientific cadres, this formula should still be valued because it represents the mass line in scientific leadership. Comrade Yan Jici mentioned that "under the current circumstances, the Party should let go and trust scientists to do their jobs well," which can represent the opinions of many scientists.

    In this way, the question of who leads science no longer exists. In fact, the question of whether the Party can lead science has today become the question of how the Party and scientists can jointly lead science. The effectiveness of this collaborative leadership will increase day by day. As Party leaders become more familiar with natural science and their numbers increase, they will be able to comprehensively synthesize the opinions of scientists; as the ideological level of scientists improves and their ranks expand, they will be able to promote the overall scientific undertaking. Therefore, how the Party helps scientists improve their ideological level and how scientists help the Party grasp scientific knowledge are, in my opinion, the two major aspects of good scientific leadership today.

    According to the current actual situation, these two aspects are still weak, so problems still occur in specific work. Comrade Zhou Peiyuan mentioned the phenomenon of excessive division of labor in past scientific undertakings, which may have been caused by the Party's overestimation of the current level of science in our country, or by scientists overstating the current level of our country. This inference is very immature and I hope everyone will correct it.

    In short, some deviations are not surprising. They are only a manifestation of the above two aspects not being strong enough, and therefore require even more joint cooperation between the Party and scientists. Chairman Mao talked about the Party's leadership of natural science at the National Propaganda Conference, which gave us new encouragement in marching towards science. The ever-victorious Party and the scientists who love truth are learning from each other. We are full of confidence that in the not-too-distant future, the scientific undertaking of the motherland will blossom and bear fruit that the people love.

    两个领导的薄弱环节
    中国科学院应用物理研究所研究员　陈能宽
    做好科学领导的两个主要环节：党如何帮助科学家提高思想水平；科学家如何帮助党掌握科学知识。
    自然科学需要领导吗？多数科学工作者的回答是肯定的。因为没有领导，在目前优良的社会里，虽然也会产生个别的大科学家，但是显而易见，个别的大科学家纵使非常名贵，却不能解决全面的问题。在科学高度专业化的今天，要全面建设，还要在短期内建设得好，没有有计划的领导，肯定是办不到的。所以由党来领导科学事业，正符合绝大多数科学工作者的衷心愿望。
    但是，自然科学发展的特点决定了所需的特殊领导方法。在过去三十年，由于党的全部精力用于领导革命，谈不到研究自然科学，也还不能在短期内熟悉每一门科学的特性，这就给了某些人一个印象——共产党讲政治可以，搞自然科学不行，因而对于党能否领导科学发生了怀疑。我认为，有这种见解的人，似乎有些论定过早，不太公平的。个人觉得，一个掌握了唯物辩证法的党，本身就是富有科学性的组织。按照推理，这样一个组织，既能领导阶级斗争，取得胜利，应该也能领导与自然界作斗争。这一点是容易相信的。
    领导科学最要注意方法，而方法中最重要的一条是实事求是，不强不知以为知；最忌讳的一条是离开了辩证法则的教条主义，机械地搬用其他领域中的领导方法。我个人认为，只要领导的方法符合实事求是的精神，那么领导的内容与领导哪些的问题，都应该随着情况的发展而改变，不便预定范畴的。这是我对涂长望与何国柱二同志的意见（见人民日报1957年4月17日第七版）的一点补充。并且，党的领导既是为了推动科学事业，没有干预、控制、或挂名的意思，那么就应该尽可能的多领导，而在尚不能领导的地方多学习。
    解放后，我国科学事业所取得的巨大成就，雄辩地说明了党在科学领导上，是并不外行的。党的最高领导用了些什么方法呢？党发出了向科学大进军的响亮号声，党特别注意对科学家的尊重与教育问题，党组织科学家制定了十二年科学规划，还有最近党提出了百花齐放、百家争鸣的政策。这些领导方法让我深深体会到是最富有创造性的方法。写成公式就是：党领导了科学家，让科学家领导科学。也就是说党通过科学家领导了科学。
    运用这个公式，弥补了今天党内科学家数目很少的缺陷。将来，纵使党员科学干部多了起来，这个公式还是应该重视的；因为它代表着科学领导中的群众路线。严济慈同志曾提到“在目前情况下，党要放手，要信任科学家来搞好自己的业务”，是能代表很多科学家的意见的。
    这样说来，谁领导科学的问题不存在了。实际上，党能否领导科学的问题，在今天变成了党如何与科学家共同领导科学的问题，这种合作领导的有效程度，是将与日俱增的。党的领导同志熟悉自然科学的程度加深，人数增多，就更能全面地综合科学家的意见；科学家们的思想水平提高，队伍扩大，就更能推动整体的科学事业。所以党如何帮助科学家提高思想水平，科学家如何帮助党掌握科学知识，个人认为是做好今天科学领导的两大环节。
    这两个环节，按照目前的实际情况说来，还是薄弱的，所以在具体的工作中，就仍然有问题发生。周培源同志提到了在过去科学事业中有分工过多的现象，就可能是党的领导对我国现有科学水平估计过高，或是科学家将我国现有水平说得过高而引起。这种推断是很不成熟的，希望大家指正。
    总之，有些偏差是不足为奇的。它只是上述两大环节尚不够坚强的表征，因而就更需要党与科学家的共同合作努力。毛主席在全国宣传会议上曾谈到党对自然科学的领导问题，给了我们在向科学进军中一个新的鼓舞。百战百胜的党和热爱真理的科学家正在相互学习，我们满有信心在不太长久的将来，使祖国的科学事业开出人民所喜爱的花果。
