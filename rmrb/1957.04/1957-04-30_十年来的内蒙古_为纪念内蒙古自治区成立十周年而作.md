Inner Mongolia in the Last Decade
-- Written in Commemoration of the 10th Anniversary of the Founding of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
Ulanhu

The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has been established for exactly ten years, since May 1, 1947.

Over the past decade, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao Zedong, and with the strong assistance of fraternal nationalities across the country, especially the Han people, and through the concerted efforts of people of all nationalities in the region, with the victory of China's people's democratic revolution and the basic victory of socialist transformation, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has achieved great success in its political, economic, and cultural construction, and the face of the autonomous region has undergone fundamental changes.

In these ten years, regional autonomy for a unified Inner Mongolia has been gradually realized, forever ending the history of more than 300 years of divided rule over the Inner Mongolian people. The Mongolian people have truly enjoyed the right to be masters of their own affairs, and the unity within the Mongolian nationality has been strengthened as never before. True equality in national status and all rights has been achieved among all fraternal nationalities, and a new national relationship of "national equality, close unity, mutual assistance, and common development" has been established and developed, creating extremely favorable conditions for the development of the Mongolian nationality and other nationalities in the region.

In these ten years, the democratic reform has been thoroughly completed, and the feudal system has been eliminated; the decisive victory has been achieved in the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicraft industry, and capitalist industry and commerce, and the socialist system has been basically established. Now, 96% of peasant households in the region have joined agricultural production cooperatives; individual handicraftsmen have all been organized into various forms of cooperatives; capitalist industry and commerce have all been transformed into joint state-private enterprises; the socialist transformation of animal husbandry is being carried out step by step on the basis of steadily developing production, and at present 83% of herder households have joined pastoral production cooperatives and various types of mutual aid teams.

In these ten years, all economic and cultural undertakings have been greatly developed, and the material and cultural lives of people of all nationalities have been significantly improved. Compared to 1946, in 1956: the total output value of industrial enterprises in the region increased 27 times, and the total industrial output value now accounts for 27% of the total industrial and agricultural output value of the region; the total grain output increased by one and a half times; the total number of large and small livestock increased more than two times; the number of various schools increased by 4.7 times, and the total number of students increased by 5.5 times; the number of medical and health institutions increased by 37 times; the purchasing power of people of all nationalities increased more than four times in 1956 compared to 1950. The population of the Inner Mongolian nationality has stopped declining and has significantly increased. The poverty and weakness of the Inner Mongolian nationality caused by the reactionary ruling class for hundreds of years has become a thing of the past, and now a vibrant and developing scene is emerging everywhere, and the long-held beautiful ideals of the Inner Mongolian nationality are being gradually realized.

The large-scale modern industrial, forestry, and railway construction carried out by the state in the autonomous region is having an increasing impact on fundamentally changing the face of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

A large number of cadres from the Mongolian and other nationalities have grown up; the ranks of the working class from the Mongolian and other nationalities are gradually growing stronger.

The patriotism and internationalism of people of all nationalities in the region have been greatly enhanced, socialist morality is taking shape, and the atmosphere of diligence, thrift, and hard work is growing.

All the achievements of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are a part of the great achievements of the revolutionary cause and socialist construction of our great motherland. Now, people of all nationalities in the region are united and advancing victoriously along the general track of the motherland's construction to rapidly build our country into a great socialist country, and are confidently transitioning to an advanced socialist nationality.

In commemorating the 10th anniversary of the founding of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, it is essential to recall the path we have traveled in the past ten years and draw lessons from it in order to complete the socialist construction tasks of the autonomous region.

Correctly implemented the Party and state's national policy, gradually realized regional autonomy for a unified Inner Mongolia

The Inner Mongolian nationality is a brave and hardworking nationality that has made glorious contributions to the founding of our great motherland. However, for more than 300 years, especially in the last century, under the cruel oppression of the domestic reactionary ruling class, the feudal forces within the nationality, and foreign imperialism, the Inner Mongolian nationality has long been in a state of divided rule, social productive forces are extremely backward, and the lives of the broad masses of people are extremely poor. Therefore, the Inner Mongolian people have always urgently demanded to get rid of the rule and oppression of imperialism, the domestic reactionary ruling class, and the feudal forces within the nationality, to achieve national liberation, to achieve people's democracy, and to achieve unified regional autonomy. In order to achieve the above goals, the Inner Mongolian nationality has carried out a long and heroic struggle, and only with the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party has the long-held ideals of the Inner Mongolian nationality gradually become a reality.

National regional autonomy is the basic policy of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong in solving China's national problems using Marxism-Leninism, and it is the consistent proposition of the Chinese Communist Party in solving national problems. As early as 1935, the Chinese Communist Party proposed to the Inner Mongolian people to abolish the Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan provinces forcibly established by the Kuomintang reactionaries, and to implement regional autonomy for a unified Inner Mongolia. During the Anti-Japanese War and the Third Revolutionary Civil War, the Chinese Communist Party, based on this policy, led and supported the liberation struggle and autonomous movement of the Inner Mongolian nationality. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government attached great importance and concern to promoting national regional autonomy. In August 1952, the Central People's Government promulgated the "Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy of the People's Republic of China." Because the Chinese Communist Party's policy of national regional autonomy conformed to the demands of the Inner Mongolian nationality, it won the heartfelt support of people from all strata of the Inner Mongolian nationality.

The regional autonomy for a unified Inner Mongolia was gradually realized with the victory of the entire Chinese revolution and the development of national construction, as well as the maturity of various working conditions.

When the people of the whole country won the victory of the Anti-Japanese War in 1945, the work in the Inner Mongolia region also faced a situation of comprehensive development. Under the leadership and assistance of the Chinese Communist Party, in November 1945, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Movement Federation was established in Zhangjiakou. Through in-depth publicity of the Chinese Communist Party's national policy and active mass work, and on the basis of raising the ideological awareness of cadres and the masses, the autonomous movements in Eastern and Western Mongolia were unified. In April 1947, the Inner Mongolia People's Representative Conference was held in Ulanhot, and on May 1, the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was established. The establishment of the People's Government of the Autonomous Region marked a victory of great historical significance for the Inner Mongolian people.

The establishment of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region coincided with the period of intense Third Revolutionary Civil War. The serious task facing the Inner Mongolian people was to resolutely repel the frantic attacks of American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries together with the people of the whole country. The Inner Mongolia Working Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government of the Autonomous Region at that time correctly implemented the Party's united front policy, formed an extremely broad people's democratic united front including workers, peasants, herdsmen, intellectuals, industrialists and businessmen, religious figures, as well as herd owners and former princes, mobilized the masses to carry out democratic reforms, and established a strong people's cavalry on the basis of reforming the old army. This army, the sons and daughters of the Inner Mongolian people, actively participated in the National People's Liberation War and defended the cause of regional autonomy of the Inner Mongolian nationality.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the system of national oppression was abolished, and the equality of all nationalities was realized, and the nature of domestic national relations underwent fundamental changes, making it possible to realize the regional autonomy of the Inner Mongolian nationality. In order to promote the construction cause of the country and the autonomous region and further solve the national problems of Inner Mongolia, the Central People's Government decided in June 1954 to abolish the establishment of Suiyuan Province and assign the original areas under the jurisdiction of Suiyuan Province to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. In July 1955, the State Council decided to assign six banners and counties including Ongniud, Chifeng, etc. from the original Rehe Province to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. In April 1956, the State Council decided to assign the Bayanhot Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture and Ejina Autonomous Banner of Gansu Province to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and established Bayannur League. Since then, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has successfully completed the historical task of promoting national regional autonomy, ending the situation of the Inner Mongolian nationality being divided for more than 300 years. This is a glorious victory of the Chinese Communist Party's great national policy.

The above process of gradually promoting and completing unified regional autonomy is completely in line with the objective reality. The reason why unified regional autonomy needs to be gradually realized is firstly because the revolution of the Inner Mongolian people is a component part of the revolution of the people of the whole country, which determines that the regional autonomy of the Inner Mongolian nationality can only be gradually realized with the victory of the revolution of the people of the whole country. Secondly, from the perspective of the Inner Mongolian nationality itself, due to the long-term divided rule in history and the influence of the feudal rule within the nationality, there is estrangement between the leagues and banners. To eliminate this estrangement, a patient and repeated process of education must be carried out. Finally, in order to realize the unified regional autonomy of the Inner Mongolian nationality, much arduous and meticulous work has been carried out from the central to the local levels, and carrying out this work also requires a period of time.

The realization of the unified regional autonomy of the Inner Mongolian nationality has extremely important significance for the development of the Mongolian nationality and other nationalities in the region: Firstly, the unification of the Inner Mongolian nationality, the establishment of a political, economic, and cultural leadership center, has greatly enhanced the internal unity and national self-confidence of the Mongolian nationality, and unprecedentedly enhanced the patriotism and internationalism of the Inner Mongolian people; Secondly, it has greatly enhanced the enthusiasm and creativity of the Mongolian nationality and other nationalities in the region in building the socialist motherland; Thirdly, it has created extremely favorable conditions for the comprehensive development of the Mongolian nationality and other nationalities in the region.

Thoroughly completed the democratic reform, achieved the decisive victory of the socialist transformation

Restoring and developing various production undertakings, building a prosperous Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and gradually improving material and cultural life are the common fundamental demands of people of all nationalities in the region. However, this demand cannot be realized under the original class relations and social system. Therefore, while promoting national regional autonomy, we have steadily carried out democratic reforms and gradually carried out socialist transformations based on national characteristics and regional characteristics and when conditions are ripe.

Before liberation, the obstacles to social development in Inner Mongolia included the oppression of imperialism, the domestic reactionary ruling class, and the feudal rule within the nationality. Therefore, the Inner Mongolian people not only have the demand to oppose imperialism and the oppression of the domestic reactionary ruling class, but also have the demand to oppose the feudal rule within the nationality. The victory of the Chinese People's Anti-Japanese War and the People's Liberation War resolved the contradictions between the Inner Mongolian people and imperialism and the domestic reactionary ruling class. The establishment of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region provided a reliable guarantee for the smooth implementation of democratic reforms within the Inner Mongolian nationality.

In the past, the class oppression in the Inner Mongolia region was mainly the exploitation and oppression of the broad masses of peasants by the landlord class in the rural areas, and the exploitation and oppression of the broad masses of herdsmen by the feudal rulers using feudal privileges in the pastoral areas. Without changing this social system, the broad masses of farmers and herdsmen would not be able to stand up, the people's regime in the autonomous region would not be consolidated, production would not be developed, and society would not progress. After the establishment of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, in order to change this social system, the method of combining top-down leadership with bottom-up mass mobilization was adopted, and a movement to reform the land system was steadily carried out in the rural areas, and a struggle to abolish feudal privileges was carried out in the pastoral areas in a peaceful manner.

In the reform of the land system, full attention was paid to the following characteristics of the rural areas of Inner Mongolia: due to the policy of national oppression implemented by the reactionary ruling class in history, a large area has been formed with a mixture of nationalities; extremely complex ethnic relations are intertwined in the land relations: on the one hand, there are class contradictions between the Mongolian and Han landlord classes and the peasants, and on the other hand, there is ethnic estrangement and contradictions left over from history; the Mongolian and Han landlord classes and counter-revolutionaries use ethnic estrangement and contradictions to provoke the unity of Mongolian and Han peasants; Mongolian farmers have only recently switched from animal husbandry to agriculture, their technology is low, and their labor force is weak, etc. Starting from these characteristics, in addition to implementing the general class policy of land reform, we also adopted the policy of adjusting ethnic relations, eliminating ethnic estrangement, strengthening the unity of farmers of all nationalities, and eliminating the landlord class in a step-by-step, differentiated, and considerate manner. According to this policy, some special policies and working methods were stipulated, the reform of the land system was completed, and ethnic unity was further enhanced.

Feudal exploitation in pastoral areas is a product of the feudal privilege system. The main focus of our democratic reform in pastoral areas is to abolish the feudal privilege system in a peaceful manner from top to bottom, implement public ownership of pastures and free grazing; implement the policy of not struggling, not dividing, not classifying classes, and benefiting both herdsmen and herd owners, so that herdsmen can be free to graze, and productive forces can be liberated from feudal bondage.

While carrying out democratic reforms, we also carried out a resolute struggle against counter-revolutionaries. Relying on the Inner Mongolia troops of the People's Liberation Army, we wiped out the bandits in the territory, organized and mobilized the broad masses of people to suppress counter-revolutionaries, consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship, and provided a strong guarantee for the production and life of people of all nationalities.

The implementation of democratic reforms in rural and pastoral areas has promoted the restoration and development of agricultural and animal husbandry production. However, democratic reform only eliminated the feudal land system and feudal privileges in pastoral areas. Under the conditions of decentralized and backward individual small-scale production, the development of productive forces is limited, and farmers and herdsmen face many difficulties in production, and their lives cannot be fundamentally improved. In order to further meet the demands of the broad masses of people to develop production and improve their lives, it is necessary to gradually carry out socialist transformation. Only the socialist system can guarantee a high degree of development in the economy and culture of every nationality.

The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region began to develop agricultural mutual aid teams in 1948 and began to try out agricultural production cooperatives in 1952. During this period, socialist transformation was gradually carried out on handicraft industry and capitalist industry and commerce, and certain achievements were made. After the promulgation of the "Resolution on Agricultural Cooperation" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in October 1955, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, like other parts of the country, launched a high tide of socialist transformation. After a few months, a decisive victory was achieved in the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicraft industry, and capitalist industry and commerce, and the relations of production and political situation in urban and rural areas of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region underwent fundamental changes. During this period, great achievements were also made in the socialist transformation of animal husbandry.

In the development of agricultural production cooperatives, we paid attention to the work of national joint cooperatives. In these cooperatives, not only were the general principles of cooperation implemented, but the characteristics and production and living habits of various nationalities were also taken into account, so that economic mutual assistance and cooperation could further promote political unity. This is an important factor for the smooth implementation of socialist transformation. Based on the situation in the agricultural areas and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia where there are more livestock and farmers have a long history of raising livestock, we distinguished between livestock and draught animals in the socialist transformation of agriculture. After land, draught animals, and other major means of production entered the cooperatives, the treatment of privately owned livestock of cooperative members adopted a policy similar to the socialist transformation of animal husbandry in pastoral areas, and proposed the policy of combining agriculture and animal husbandry and diversified operations to encourage farmers to actively raise livestock and better develop agricultural and animal husbandry production. In the process of socialist transformation of agriculture, in view of the situation in the western region where Mongolian farmers have more land and a weaker labor force, some special methods have been formulated to provide appropriate care in terms of labor arrangement, private plots, and distribution to ensure that the living standards of Mongolian farmers are not lowered and can be improved accordingly with the gradual development of agricultural cooperatives. This is absolutely necessary and conducive to ethnic unity, socialist transformation, and the development of agricultural production.

For the socialist transformation of animal husbandry in pastoral areas, the policy of "relying on laboring herdsmen, uniting all possible forces, and gradually carrying out socialist transformation on the basis of stabilizing and developing production" was implemented according to the characteristics of animal husbandry, the social conditions of pastoral areas, and the awareness of herdsmen. In the work process, various policies and methods were adopted according to the principles of policy stability, broad methods, and long time, which were wholeheartedly supported by the broad masses of herdsmen, and the mutual assistance and cooperation movement of animal husbandry was steadily developed. For the transformation of the herd owner economy, peaceful transformation methods and various forms were adopted based on the above policies and principles, and joint state-private ranches were tried out, which were welcomed by the herd owners. Combined with the socialist transformation of animal husbandry, the settlement of nomadic people was promoted, and economic centers were established in pastoral areas, which played a significant role in promoting the prosperity of both people and animals and economic development in pastoral areas.

In the process of democratic reform and socialist transformation, we implemented the policy of freedom of religious belief. The patriotic awareness of the broad masses of religious figures has been greatly enhanced, and they have expressed their support for various social movements.

In the democratic reform, some areas did not proceed from the local specific conditions and mechanically applied the work experience of other areas, and made mistakes that violated the principle of prudence and steadiness. In the socialist transformation, some agricultural areas and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas made mistakes in neglecting the characteristics of animal husbandry and violating the principle of gradually carrying out socialist transformation on the basis of stabilizing and developing production. When agricultural production cooperatives were transformed from elementary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives, some areas did not give appropriate consideration to the land that Mongolian farmers had distributed more during the land reform, which somewhat affected the income of Mongolian farmers. In some areas, not enough consideration was given to the special circumstances of the production and lives of certain minority farmers. In the socialist transformation of handicraft industry and private industry and commerce, there were also local biases in excessively concentrating and blindly merging factories and shops, disregarding the original operating characteristics and the convenience of people's lives. These problems were brought to attention and most have been corrected or are being corrected after they were discovered. The occurrence of these problems is mainly because many of our comrades, including the leaders of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, do not deeply understand the truth of Chairman Mao's exhortation to us that "all work must proceed from reality," are accustomed to general leadership, and do not study the constantly changing objective situation enough, so they cannot better integrate the central policies with the actual situation of the autonomous region and implement them in accordance with local conditions and timing. This is a lesson we should deeply remember.

Vigorously restore and develop economic and cultural undertakings, laying a preliminary foundation for changing the face of the autonomous region

The Inner Mongolian nationality has realized regional autonomy and politically enjoys the right to be masters of its own affairs. But to rise to the ranks of advanced nations and transition to socialism, the fundamental issue is to develop the autonomous region's economic and cultural construction undertakings.

Before liberation, due to various reasons such as natural conditions and social development in the Inner Mongolia region, the economic components were extremely complex, there was very little industry, transportation was inconvenient, and many areas lacked commercial exchange centers. These were all difficulties in restoring and developing production at that time.

After the establishment of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, facing the above-mentioned difficulties, while carrying out democratic reforms, we adopted the policy of vigorously restoring and developing agricultural and animal husbandry production and gradually restoring and developing other economic undertakings. Under the guidance of the above policy, through the assistance of the state and the efforts of people of all nationalities and cadres throughout the region, by the end of 1952, the tasks of the economic recovery period were successfully completed, the people's living standards were considerably improved, and ethnic relations were further improved, preparing the conditions for the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to carry out planned economic construction.

In 1953, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region entered a period of planned economic construction in accordance with the requirements of the national plan, closely integrating the various construction undertakings of the autonomous region with the unified national plan. The basic tasks of the autonomous region's first Five-Year Plan were: to vigorously develop agricultural and animal husbandry production centered on mutual assistance and cooperation to support the country's socialist industrialization; to vigorously support national key construction projects, especially the construction of the Baotou industrial base; to actively develop local industry, forestry, transportation, postal and telecommunications, commerce, education, health, culture, and other undertakings according to plan; to actively and steadily implement the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicraft industry, and capitalist industry and commerce to ensure that the proportion of socialist economic components continues to grow, to successfully complete the national plan, and to lay a preliminary foundation for changing the backward face of the autonomous region's economy and culture. The first Five-Year Plan has now been successfully implemented for more than four years, and the tasks stipulated in the plan are expected to be completed as scheduled, and some can be completed ahead of schedule and overfulfilled.

The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has vast agricultural and pastoral areas, and the vast majority of the region's population lives in rural and pastoral areas. Agricultural and animal husbandry production occupies a very important position in the autonomous region's economy. Developing agricultural and animal husbandry production and increasing grain, cash crops, livestock, and livestock products are of great significance for supporting national industrial construction, improving people's lives, and accumulating construction funds. Therefore, whether in the economic recovery period or the planned economic construction period, we have regarded the development of agricultural and animal husbandry production as an important task of the autonomous region.

In developing agricultural and animal husbandry production, we have adopted the policy of mutual support between agricultural and pastoral areas, reducing the consumption of livestock for food in pastoral areas and the large-scale death of livestock due to wind and snow disasters, and solved the difficulty of lack of draught animals in agricultural areas, promoting the restoration and development of agricultural and animal husbandry production. In semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, the policy of "giving priority to animal husbandry, taking care of agriculture, protecting pastures, and prohibiting reclamation" was implemented, and erroneous ideas such as "emphasizing agriculture and neglecting animal husbandry" and "backward animal husbandry" were criticized, and farmland and pastures were divided. After the realization of cooperation in agricultural areas and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, in order to adapt to the needs of agricultural and animal husbandry development, the policy of "overall planning, combining agriculture and animal husbandry, diversified operations, and developing agricultural and animal husbandry production in a planned way" was stipulated, clarifying the direction of production development in semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas. Half of the livestock in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are in agricultural areas and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas. The Mongolian and Han farmers in these areas, especially the Mongolian farmers, have a long history of grazing and raising livestock. Subsidiary production in agricultural areas generally accounts for about 30% of farmers' total income, of which animal husbandry accounts for a large proportion. Therefore, we have adopted the policy of increasing grain production as the main focus in agricultural areas, while vigorously developing animal husbandry and other subsidiary production. Facts have proved that this policy is completely correct.

Animal husbandry production in pastoral areas is highly dependent on nature and is more unstable than agricultural production. Therefore, we have stipulated different policies in pastoral areas, implementing the policy of focusing on mutual assistance and cooperation to prevent disasters and protect livestock, and vigorously developing animal husbandry. In order to ensure the relatively stable development of animal husbandry production, we have promoted the settlement of nomadic people based on mutual assistance and cooperation in animal husbandry production, focused on opening up artificial feed bases, building winter and spring camps, and popularizing new-style grass-cutting tools. These efforts have now achieved initial results. Breeding stations, grass-cutting stations, veterinary stations, and state-owned ranches directly invested in by the state have also played a significant role in helping herdsmen carry out technical reforms and breed improvement in animal husbandry production.

The development of agricultural and animal husbandry production must be closely coordinated with forestry, water conservancy, meteorology, and other undertakings, and unified planning. The climate in the Inner Mongolia region is dry and there are many winds and sands. Therefore, we have always regarded the development of farmland water conservancy and afforestation as important measures to ensure the increase in agricultural and animal husbandry production. These measures have begun to show their role in transforming nature and preventing wind and sand disasters. In recent years, meteorological construction undertakings have also developed significantly.

In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, certain economic regions and certain economies are closely related to the economic lives of certain nationalities. Formulating correct policies and correct working measures in economic construction is the central issue in implementing the Party's national policy. The production in mountainous areas is closely related to the production and life of the Daur, Oroqen, and Evenk people. In the past, some areas did not proceed from their production characteristics and one-sidedly emphasized closing mountains for afforestation, which made their production and life difficult for a time. When we stipulated production policies suitable for mountainous areas and ethnic minority areas, the situation improved.

The state has issued a large number of production loans to people of all nationalities, which has strongly supported the restoration and development of agricultural and animal husbandry production and other economic undertakings.

The fundamental change in the face of the autonomous region lies in the development of modern industry. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in his political report to the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China: "If various minority nationalities are to develop into modern nationalities, in addition to carrying out social reforms, the fundamental key is to develop modern industry in their regions." The construction of the Baotou Iron and Steel Industrial Base, which the state began during the first Five-Year Plan, is a major event for the people of the whole country and the people of Inner Mongolia. The completion of the Baotou Iron and Steel Industrial Base will fundamentally change the face of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. In the past few years, the state has also vigorously developed the forestry industry in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, established the sugar industry, and built the Ji'er Railway and several forest railways. The Baolan Railway is also under active construction. With the development of large-scale industry and railways, industrial cities such as Baotou, Hohhot, Jining, Hailar, and Yakeshi have emerged, and a number of emerging towns have appeared in forest areas and grasslands, promoting the economic and cultural development of the autonomous region. People of all nationalities in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have actively and proactively supported the state's industrial and railway construction in all aspects, and must continue to strengthen this work in the future to ensure the successful implementation of the state's various construction projects in the autonomous region.

With the development of agricultural and animal husbandry production and the construction of national large-scale industry, local industry has developed rapidly. In developing local industry, we have implemented the policy of serving agricultural and animal husbandry production, serving the needs of urban and rural people's lives, and serving the construction of national large-scale industry. A manufacturing and repair network for new-style agricultural tools and animal husbandry tools has been initially formed, supporting agricultural and animal husbandry production and socialist transformation; a number of dairy processing plants, several leather and wool manufacturing plants, and two modernized meat joint processing plants have been established. In order to meet the needs of urban and rural people and the country, the coal mining, salt, alkali, food, mica, asbestos, and other industries have been developed; in order to meet the needs of large-scale industry and transportation, a number of building materials and other collaborative industries have been developed. In addition, we have restored and developed handicraft industry, appropriately meeting the needs of farmers and herdsmen for production and the needs of urban and rural people for daily necessities.

Developing state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce in ethnic minority areas is not only an important economic task, but also an important political task that embodies the Party's national policy. During the period of national economic recovery and the planned economic construction period, we have made great efforts to develop state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce. State-owned commerce and cooperative commerce have penetrated into the vast urban areas, rural areas, pastoral areas, and forest areas, implemented fair and reasonable price policies, implemented the policy of purchasing agricultural, animal husbandry, and hunting products from farmers, herdsmen, and hunters, even if there are losses at times, and supplying them with the necessities for production and life, so that the trade cooperation undertaking has become a link of mutual support between industry, agriculture, and animal husbandry.

With the recovery and development of production construction and the implementation of planned economic construction, cultural education and health undertakings have also developed greatly. In the past ten years, primary and secondary schools have been restored, consolidated, and developed, institutions of higher learning have been established in a planned way, ethnic languages have been vigorously developed, a large number of books in ethnic languages have been published, social education, worker spare-time education, and national sports activities have been actively carried out, new literary and artistic cadres have been trained, and cultural and artistic undertakings have been developed. The plague, which once seriously endangered people's lives, has been basically controlled. Patients with venereal diseases have been universally treated, promoting the increase in population fertility and changing the situation of drastic decline in the population of the Mongolian nationality and ethnic minorities in the region, and a new atmosphere of increasingly prosperous population has emerged. On the basis of the gradual development of economic and cultural construction undertakings and the continuous improvement of labor productivity of employees, the material and cultural living standards of people of all nationalities in the region have been significantly improved.

The main problems that have occurred and still exist in economic and cultural construction work are: lack of thorough and systematic investigation and research, some work cannot be well implemented according to the characteristics of nationalities and regions, to implement the general principles and policies of the Party and the country, and there is often a bias in applying the work experience of other regions. There is a lack of regular inspections on the implementation of the Party and the country's national policy in various undertakings, and phenomena that violate the national policy have not been discovered and corrected in a timely manner. There is insufficient understanding of the special needs of the construction of ethnic minority areas in the region. In certain construction undertakings, because the leadership did not fully consider the needs and possibilities, and did not frequently and timely summarize experience and improve cadres, there was a right-leaning conservative bias at one time; and at another time, there was a bias of blind advance. The development speed of industrial construction undertaken by the state in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was underestimated, and the specific organizational leadership lagged behind the needs of the actual work development. All of these are mainly caused by the fact that after our leadership shifted its focus to economic construction, the specific organizational work and political and ideological work did not keep up. Some of these shortcomings or errors are difficult to completely avoid due to the lack of experience of our leaders and cadres.

Massively cultivate cadres of the Mongolian and other nationalities, providing decisive conditions for the realization of various tasks

Massively cultivating and boldly using cadres of the Mongolian and other nationalities is the decisive condition for the successful completion of various tasks in the autonomous region.

Over the past ten years, we have adopted various methods to cultivate cadres. In the preparatory period for promoting regional autonomy, we relied on a group of old Mongolian and Han cadres as leaders, and adopted the method of running schools and training classes to train and cultivate a group of Mongolian young intellectual cadres. After the establishment of the autonomous region, we put a large number of cadres who have been trained into the Liberation War and various mass movements, so that they can be trained and improved. During this period, a large number of outstanding people who emerged in the mass struggles were trained to become grassroots cadres.

In the economic construction period, in order to adapt to the needs of the development of various tasks in the autonomous region, we have opened various schools and training classes to systematically improve the political theory and professional level of in-service cadres, and trained a large number of cadres of all nationalities and cultural, scientific, and technical talents. In the past ten years, a total of 130,000 cadres of all nationalities have been trained in the region, including 20,000 Mongolian cadres and more than 4,800 cadres from ethnic minorities in the region. These cadres have become the backbone of various tasks in the autonomous region, and many people have already assumed various leadership positions.

To carry out the work in ethnic minority areas, there must be a group of high-quality old cadres as the backbone, which is especially necessary when opening up the work. While vigorously cultivating Mongolian cadres and minority cadres, it is also necessary to pay attention to cultivating local Han cadres. With the development of work, Han cadres from outside the region are also needed to participate in the work of the autonomous region, and we should warmly welcome them. However, due to the great Han chauvinism ideas left over from history, some people often unconsciously reveal a sense of superiority of the great Han nationality to varying degrees when they first come to work in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and are prone to the problems of undertaking and substituting, being impetuous, and applying the experience of the Han nationality mechanically in their work. Some comrades inevitably have "guest ideas." For these comrades, we must patiently help them, so that they can establish deep feelings with the broad masses of the Inner Mongolian people in their work and serve the Inner Mongolian people wholeheartedly.

Strengthening the unity of Mongolian and Han cadres is the key to the unity of the Mongolian and Han people. We have adopted the method of criticism and self-criticism to educate Han cadres, overcome the remnants of great Han chauvinism ideas, and sincerely respect and help Mongolian cadres in all aspects, humbly learn from them, and respect the customs and habits of the Mongolian and ethnic minority peoples in the region. At the same time, we have also educated Mongolian cadres to warmly welcome the help of Han cadres, and constantly criticized the ideological sentiments of thinking that the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region can be built without the help of Han people and cadres, as well as various local nationalism ideas.

To completely solve the national problems of Inner Mongolia, it is impossible without a large number of communist cadres from the Mongolian and other ethnic groups in the region. In the past ten years, with the development of various tasks, we have developed a large number of communist party members among the Mongolian people and other ethnic groups in the region, established party organizations, and strengthened the leadership of the party. While developing the communist party organization, we have established and developed trade unions, the Communist Youth League, the Women's Federation, and other people's organizations. Through these organizations, we have repeatedly carried out the Party's national policy and patriotic and internationalist propaganda and education to cadres and the masses of people of all nationalities, and constantly enhanced the unity between and within the nationalities, ensuring the smooth development of various construction undertakings in the autonomous region.

The people of all nationalities across the country are striving to build our motherland into a great, advanced, and industrialized country under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao Zedong. In this common cause of the people of all nationalities in the motherland, the basic tasks of our Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are: to extensively and deeply mobilize and organize the people of all nationalities and strata in the autonomous region, concentrate all forces under the unified national plan, and further develop the autonomous region's economic and cultural construction undertakings; to vigorously strengthen the leadership and support for the industrial construction undertaken by the state in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region; and to gradually improve the material and cultural lives of people of all nationalities on the basis of continuous development of production. After several five-year plans, all nationalities in the autonomous region will jointly improve to the level of advanced nationalities and transition to a socialist society with the people of all nationalities in the motherland. This is an extremely arduous and glorious task to completely change the face of the autonomous region and fundamentally solve the national problems. The achievements made in the past ten years have only laid

    十年来的内蒙古
    ——为纪念内蒙古自治区成立十周年而作
    乌兰夫
    内蒙古自治区从1947年5月1日成立以来，到今天整整十年了。
    十年来，在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛泽东主席的正确领导下，在全国各兄弟民族、特别是汉族人民的大力帮助下，经过全区各民族人民的一致努力，随着我国人民民主革命的胜利和社会主义改造的基本胜利，内蒙古自治区的政治、经济、文化建设都获得了巨大的成就，自治区的面貌已经发生了根本性质的变化。
    在这十年中，逐步实现了内蒙古民族统一的区域自治，永远结束了内蒙古民族三百多年来被分割统治的历史。蒙古民族人民真正享有了当家作主的权利，蒙古民族内部的团结空前增强。各兄弟民族之间真正实现了民族地位和一切权利方面的平等，建立和发展了“民族平等、亲密团结、互相帮助、共同发展”的新的民族关系，为蒙古民族和区内其它民族的发展创造了极为有利的条件。
    在这十年中，彻底完成了民主改革，消灭了封建制度；取得了农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的决定性胜利，社会主义制度已经基本建立起来。现在全区已有96％的农户参加了农业生产合作社；个体手工业者已经全部组织到各种形式的合作社内；资本主义工商业已全部改造为公私合营企业；对畜牧业的社会主义改造，正在稳定发展生产的基础上逐步进行，目前参加牧业生产合作社和各种类型互助组的牧户已占总牧户的83％。
    在这十年中，各项经济文化事业有了巨大发展，各民族人民的物质、文化生活有了显著提高。以1956年同1946年比较：全区工业企业总产值增长了二十七倍，全部工业产值现已占全区工农业总产值的27％；粮食总产量增长了一倍半；大小牲畜总头数增长了二倍以上；各类学校增长了四点七倍，学生总数增长了五点五倍；医疗卫生机构增长了三十七倍；各民族人民的购买力，1956年比1950年增长了四倍以上。内蒙古民族的人口已经停止了下降，并有显著上升。几百年来反动统治阶级所造成的内蒙古民族的贫困和衰弱状况，已经成为过去，现在到处呈现着蓬勃发展的青春景象，内蒙古民族多年来的美好理想正在逐步地实现。
    国家在自治区进行的规模巨大的现代工业、森林工业和铁路建设，对根本改变内蒙古自治区的面貌正在发生越来越大的影响。
    蒙古民族和其他民族的干部已经大批成长起来；蒙古民族和其他民族的工人阶级的队伍，正在逐渐壮大。
    全区各民族人民的爱国主义和国际主义觉悟有了很大提高，社会主义道德正在形成，勤俭朴素、艰苦奋斗的风气日益增长。
    内蒙古自治区的一切成就，是我们伟大祖国革命事业和社会主义建设事业的巨大成就的一部分。现在，全区各民族人民，正团结一致地沿着祖国建设的总轨道，为把我国迅速建成一个伟大的社会主义国家而胜利前进，满怀信心地向先进的社会主义民族过渡。
    在纪念内蒙古自治区成立十周年的时候，回忆一下十年来走过的道路，从中吸取经验教训，对完成自治区的社会主义建设任务，是十分必要的。
    正确地执行了党和国家的民族政策，逐步实现了内蒙古民族统一的区域自治
    内蒙古民族是一个勇敢勤劳的民族，对我们伟大祖国的缔造有过光荣的贡献。但是三百多年来，特别是近百年来，内蒙古民族在国内反动统治阶级、民族内部封建势力和外国帝国主义的残酷压迫下，长期处于被分割统治的状态，社会生产力极为落后，广大人民的生活极端贫困。因此，内蒙古民族人民一直迫切要求摆脱帝国主义、国内反动统治阶级和民族内部封建势力的统治压迫，实现民族解放，实现人民民主，实现统一的区域自治。为了达到上述目的，内蒙古民族曾经进行了长期的英勇的斗争，直到有了中国共产党的领导，内蒙古民族多年来的理想才逐步变为现实。
    民族区域自治，是中国共产党和毛泽东同志运用马克思列宁主义解决我国民族问题的基本政策，是中国共产党解决民族问题的一贯主张。早在1935年中国共产党就曾向内蒙古人民提出撤销国民党反动派强设的热、察、绥等省制，实行内蒙古民族统一的区域自治的主张。在抗日战争和第三次国内革命战争时期，中国共产党依据这个方针，领导和支持了内蒙古民族的解放斗争和自治运动。中华人民共和国成立以后，中国共产党和中央人民政府更以极大的重视和关怀来推行民族区域自治。1952年8月，中央人民政府公布了“中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要”。由于中国共产党的民族区域自治政策，符合内蒙古民族的要求，因而获得了内蒙古民族各阶层人民的衷心拥护。
    内蒙古民族统一的区域自治，是随着整个中国革命的胜利和国家建设的发展以及各项工作条件的成熟而逐步实现的。
    当1945年全国人民赢得了抗日战争的胜利时，内蒙古地区的工作也面临全面开展的局势。在中国共产党的领导和帮助下，1945年11月，在张家口成立了内蒙古自治运动联合会。经过深入宣传中国共产党的民族政策，积极进行群众工作，在干部和群众思想觉悟提高的基础上，把东、西蒙的自治运动统一了起来。1947年4月在乌兰浩特召开了内蒙古人民代表会议，5月1日成立了内蒙古自治区人民政府。自治区人民政府的成立，标志着内蒙古人民赢得了具有重大历史意义的胜利。
    内蒙古自治区人民政府成立时，正值第三次国内革命战争激烈进行的时期。摆在内蒙古人民面前的严重任务，是同全国人民一道，坚决打退美帝国主义及国民党反动派的疯狂进攻。当时的中共内蒙古工作委员会和自治区人民政府，正确地执行了党的统一战线政策，组成了包括工人、农民、牧民、知识界、工商界、宗教界以及牧主和过去的王公在内的极其广泛的人民民主统一战线，发动群众进行了民主改革，并且在改造旧军队的基础上建立了坚强的人民骑兵。这支内蒙古人民的子弟兵，积极参加了全国人民解放战争，保卫了内蒙古民族的区域自治事业。
    中华人民共和国成立后，取消了民族压迫制度，实现了各民族的一律平等，国内民族关系发生了根本性质的变化，使内蒙古民族统一的区域自治，有了实现的可能。为了推进国家和自治区的建设事业，进一步解决内蒙古民族问题，中央人民政府于1954年6月决定撤销绥远省建制，将绥远省原辖地区划归内蒙古自治区。1955年7月国务院决定将原热河省翁牛特、赤峰等六个旗、县划归内蒙古自治区。1956年4月国务院决定将甘肃省的巴彦浩特蒙古族自治州和额济纳自治旗划归内蒙古自治区，并成立巴彦淖尔盟。从此，内蒙古自治区圆满地完成了推行民族区域自治的历史任务，结束了三百多年来内蒙古民族被分割的局面。这是中国共产党伟大的民族政策的辉煌胜利。
    以上逐步推行和完成统一的区域自治的过程，是完全符合客观实际情况的。统一的区域自治所以需要逐步实现，首先是因为内蒙古人民的革命是全国人民革命的一个组成部分，这就决定了内蒙古民族统一的区域自治只能随着全国人民革命的胜利而逐步实现。其次，从内蒙古民族本身来说，由于历史上长期被分割统治和民族内部封建统治的影响，造成各盟、旗之间的隔阂。要消除这种隔阂，必须经过一个耐心的、反复的教育过程。最后，为实现内蒙古民族统一的区域自治，从中央到地方都进行了许多艰苦细致的工作，进行这些工作也需要一段过程。
    内蒙古民族统一的区域自治的实现，对蒙古民族和区内其他民族的发展，具有极为重大的意义：第一、内蒙古民族的统一，政治、经济、文化领导中心的确立，大大地增强了蒙古民族内部的团结和民族自信心，空前地提高了内蒙古人民的爱国主义和国际主义觉悟；第二、大大地发挥了蒙古民族和区内其它民族人民建设社会主义祖国的积极性和创造性；第三、为蒙古民族和区内其它民族的全面发展，创造了极为有利的条件。
    彻底完成了民主改革，取得了社会主义改造的决定性胜利
    恢复和发展各项生产事业，建设繁荣的内蒙古自治区，逐步提高物质、文化生活，是全区各民族人民共同的根本要求。但是，这一要求是不可能在原有的阶级关系和社会制度下实现的。因此，在推行民族区域自治的同时，我们根据民族特点和地区特点，在条件成熟的情况下，稳步地进行了民主改革，逐步地进行了社会主义改造。
    解放以前，阻碍内蒙古社会发展的有帝国主义、国内反动统治阶级的压迫，还有民族内部的封建统治。因此，内蒙古人民不仅有反对帝国主义、反对国内反动统治阶级压迫的要求，而且也有反对民族内部封建统治的要求。中国人民抗日战争和人民解放战争的胜利，解决了内蒙古人民同帝国主义和国内反动统治阶级的矛盾。内蒙古自治区人民政府的成立，为在内蒙古民族内部顺利进行民主改革，提供了可靠的保证。
    内蒙古地区过去的阶级压迫，在农村主要是地主阶级对广大农民的剥削压迫，在牧区是封建统治者利用封建特权对广大牧民的剥削压迫。不改变这种社会制度，广大农牧民就得不到翻身，自治区人民政权就得不到巩固，生产就得不到发展，社会就得不到进步。内蒙古自治区人民政府成立后，为了改变这种社会制度，采取自上而下的领导同自下而上发动群众相结合的方法，在农村稳步地开展了改革土地制度的运动，在牧区用和平方式开展了废除封建特权的斗争。
    在改革土地制度中，充分注意了内蒙古农村的下述特点：由于历史上反动统治阶级实行民族压迫政策的结果，在很大部分地区造成民族杂居；土地关系中交织着极复杂的民族关系：一方面存在着蒙汉地主阶级与农民的阶级矛盾，一方面存在着历史上遗留下来的民族隔阂和矛盾；蒙汉地主阶级及反革命分子又利用民族隔阂和矛盾来挑拨蒙汉农民的团结；蒙古族农民由牧业转农业年代不久，技术低，劳力弱等等。我们从这些特点出发，除了执行土地改革的一般阶级政策而外，还采取了调整民族关系，消除民族隔阂，加强各民族农民的团结，有步骤有分别有照顾地消灭地主阶级的方针。根据这一方针规定了一些特殊政策和工作方法，完成了土地制度的改革，进一步增强了民族团结。
    牧区封建剥削是封建特权制度的产物。我们在牧区实行民主改革主要是自上而下的用和平方式废除封建特权制度，实行牧场公有，自由放牧；实行不斗不分，不划阶级，牧工牧主两利政策，使牧民得到放牧自由，使生产力从封建束缚下解放出来。
    在进行民主改革的同时，我们还同反革命分子进行了坚决的斗争。依靠人民解放军内蒙古部队剿灭了境内的土匪，组织与发动广大人民镇压了反革命分子，巩固了人民民主专政，使各民族人民的生产与生活得到了有力的保障。
    在农村、牧区实行民主改革的结果，促进了农牧业生产的恢复与发展。但是，民主改革仅仅消灭了封建的土地制度和牧区的封建特权，在分散落后的个体小生产的条件下，生产力的发展是有限度的，农牧民在生产上的困难很多，生活上也不可能得到根本的改善。为了进一步满足广大人民发展生产和改善生活的要求，必须逐步地进行社会主义改造。只有社会主义制度，才能保证每一个民族在经济和文化上有高度的发展。
    内蒙古自治区由1948年开始发展农业互助组，1952年开始试办农业生产合作社。这一时期，对手工业和资本主义工商业也逐步进行了社会主义改造，并取得了一定的成绩。在1955年10月，中国共产党第七届六中全会关于农业合作化问题的决议公布之后，内蒙古自治区和全国各地一样，掀起了社会主义改造的高潮。经过几个月的时间，就取得了对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业社会主义改造的决定性胜利，使内蒙古自治区城乡生产关系和政治形势发生了根本性质的变化。这一时期，对畜牧业的社会主义改造也取得了很大成绩。
    在发展农业生产合作社中，我们注意了民族联合社的工作。在这些社里不仅贯彻了合作化的一般原则，而且照顾了各民族的特点和生产生活习惯，使之由经济上的互助合作进一步促进政治上的团结，这是顺利进行社会主义改造的重要因素。根据内蒙古农区和半农半牧区牧畜较多和农民有长期饲养牧畜的历史情况，在农业的社会主义改造中，把牧畜和耕畜区别开来，在土地、耕畜等主要生产资料入社以后，对社员私有牧畜的处理，采取相同于牧区畜牧业社会主义改造的政策，并提出了农牧结合、多种经营的方针，以鼓励农民饲养牧畜的积极性，更好地发展农牧业生产。在农业的社会主义改造过程中，针对西部地区蒙古族农民土地占有较多、劳动力较弱等情况，曾制订一些特殊的办法，在劳力安排、自留地及分配等方面，给予适当的照顾，以保证蒙古族农民的生活水平不致降低，并可随着农业社生产的逐步发展而得到相应的改善。这样做是完全必要的，是有利于民族团结，有利于社会主义改造和农业生产的发展的。
    对牧区畜牧业的社会主义改造，根据畜牧业特点与牧区社会条件及牧民的觉悟，贯彻执行了“依靠劳动牧民，团结一切可能团结的力量，在稳定发展生产的基础上，逐步进行社会主义改造”的方针。在工作过程中，根据政策稳、办法宽、时间长的原则，采取了各种不同的政策和办法，得到了广大牧民的衷心拥护，使畜牧业的互助合作运动得到稳步的发展。对牧主经济的改造，根据上述方针和原则，采取了和平改造的办法和多种多样的形式，试办了公私合营牧场，受到了牧主的欢迎。结合对畜牧业的社会主义改造，推行了定居游牧，建立了牧区经济中心点，对牧区人畜两旺和经济发展，起了重大的促进作用。
    在民主改革和社会主义改造的过程中，我们执行了宗教信仰自由的政策。广大宗教界人士的爱国主义觉悟，有了很大提高，他们对各种社会运动，表示了拥护和支持。
    在民主改革中，某些地区曾经不从当地的具体情况出发，生搬硬套其他地区的工作经验，发生过违反慎重稳进的方针的错误。在社会主义改造中，部分农区和半农半牧区曾发生过忽视畜牧业特点，违反在稳定发展生产的基础上，逐步进行社会主义改造的方针的错误。在农业生产合作社由初级社转高级社时，有些地区对蒙古族农民在土地改革时多分的土地未给予适当照顾，曾多少影响了蒙古族农民的收入。在若干地区对某些少数民族农民的生产、生活的特殊情况照顾不够。在对手工业和私营工商业的社会主义改造中，也曾局部地发生过不顾原有经营特点与人民生活的便利，过分集中和盲目并厂、并店的偏向。上述问题，在发现后即提起注意，大部已经纠正，有的正在纠正。这些问题的发生，主要是由于我们许多同志包括内蒙古自治区领导在内，对毛主席谆谆教导我们的“一切工作要从实际出发”这一真理，体会不深，习惯于一般化的领导，对不断变化着的客观情况研究不够，因而对中央的政策不能更好地结合自治区的实际情况，因地、因时制宜地贯彻执行。这是我们应当深切记取的教训。
    大力恢复和发展经济文化事业，为改变自治区的面貌奠定了初步基础
    内蒙古民族实现了区域自治，在政治上享有了当家作主的权利。但要提高到先进民族的行列，过渡到社会主义，根本的问题是发展自治区的经济、文化建设事业。
    解放以前，内蒙古地区由于自然条件和社会发展的各种原因，经济成分极为复杂，工业极少，交通不便，许多地区缺乏商业交换中心。这些都是当时恢复与发展生产的困难。
    内蒙古自治区人民政府成立后，面对着上述困难，在进行民主改革的同时，我们采取了大力恢复和发展农牧业生产，逐步恢复和发展其他经济事业的方针。在上述方针指导下，经过国家的帮助和全区各民族人民与干部的努力，到1952年底，胜利地完成了经济恢复时期的任务，人民的生活水平有了相当的提高，民族关系也有进一步改善，为内蒙古自治区进行计划经济建设准备了条件。
    1953年内蒙古自治区按照国家计划的要求，进入了有计划的经济建设时期，使自治区的各项建设事业与国家统一的计划紧密地结合起来。自治区第一个五年计划的基本任务是：大力发展以互助合作为中心的农牧业生产，支援国家社会主义工业化；大力支援国家重点建设，特别是包头工业基地的建设；按计划积极发展地方工业、林业、运输业、邮电、商业、教育、卫生、文化等事业；积极地稳步地实行对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，保证社会主义经济成分的比重不断增长，完满实现国家计划，为改变自治区经济文化的落后面貌奠定初步基础。第一个五年计划现已胜利地执行了四年多，计划所规定的任务，预计大部可以如期完成，有些还可以提前和超额完成。
    内蒙古自治区有广大的农区和牧区，全区人口的绝大多数居住在农村、牧区，农牧业生产在自治区经济中占有极重要的地位。发展农牧业生产，增加粮食、经济作物与牲畜、畜产品，对支援国家工业建设，改善人民生活，积累建设资金，都有十分重要的意义。因此，无论在经济恢复时期和计划经济建设时期，我们都把发展农牧业生产作为自治区的重要任务。
    在发展农牧业生产上，我们采取了农牧区相互支援的方针，减少了牧区牲畜的食用消耗及因风雪灾害造成的牲畜的大批死亡，解决了农区缺乏耕畜的困难，促进了农牧业生产的恢复与发展。在半农半牧区执行了“以牧为主、照顾农业、保护牧场、禁止开荒”的政策，批判了“重农轻牧”、“牧业落后”等错误思想，划分了农田和牧场。在农区和半农半牧区实现合作化以后，为适应农牧业发展的需要，又规定了“全面规划、农牧结合、多种经营、有计划地发展农牧业生产”的方针，明确了半农半牧区生产发展的方向。内蒙古自治区牲畜的一半在农区和半农半牧区，这些地区的蒙汉族农民、尤其是蒙古族农民，有长期放牧饲养牲畜的历史。农业区的副业生产一般占农民总收入的30％上下，其中畜牧业所占比重很大，因此我们在农区采取了以增产粮食为主，同时大力发展畜牧业及其他副业生产的方针。事实证明，这个方针是完全正确的。
    牧区畜牧业生产对自然的依赖性很大，比农业生产更不稳定。因此，我们在牧区又规定了不同于农区的政策，执行了以互助合作防灾保畜为中心，大力发展畜牧业的方针。为了保证畜牧业生产比较稳定的发展，以畜牧业生产互助合作为基础，推行了定居游牧，重点开辟了人工饲料基地，建设了冬春营地，推广了新式打搂草工具，这些工作现在都已获得初步成效。由国家直接投资举办的配种站、打草站、兽医站及国营牧场等，在帮助牧民进行畜牧业生产的技术改革和畜种改良等方面，也起了重大作用。
    农牧业生产的发展，必须有林业、水利、气象等事业密切配合，并统一规划。内蒙古地区气候干燥，风沙大，因而我们一直把发展农田水利和植树造林，作为保证农牧业增产的重要措施。这些措施，对改造自然、防止风沙灾害已开始显示作用。几年来，气象建设事业也有显著发展。
    在内蒙古自治区，一定的经济地区和一定的经济，是与一定的民族经济生活有密切联系的。在经济建设中制定正确的方针政策与正确的工作措施，是贯彻执行党的民族政策的中心问题。山林地区的生产与达斡尔、鄂伦春、鄂温克族人民的生产、生活有密切关系。过去有些地区不从他们的生产特点出发，片面地强调封山育林，使他们的生产、生活一度遭到困难。当我们规定了适合山区、少数民族地区的生产方针之后，情况就有了好转。
    国家给各民族人民发放了大量的生产贷款，有力地扶持了农牧业生产及其它经济事业的恢复与发展。
    自治区面貌的根本改变，关键在于现代工业的发展。刘少奇同志在中国共产党第八次全国代表大会上所作的政治报告中说：“各少数民族要发展成为现代民族，除进行社会改革以外，根本的关键是要在他们的地区发展现代工业。”国家在第一个五年计划期间开始的包头钢铁工业基地的建设，对全国人民和内蒙古人民都是一件大事。包头钢铁工业基地的建成，将使内蒙古自治区的面貌发生根本变化。在过去几年中，国家在内蒙古自治区还大力发展了森林工业，兴办了制糖工业，修筑了集二铁路和好几条森林铁路。包兰铁路也正在积极修建。随着大工业与铁路的发展，出现了包头、呼和浩特、集宁、海拉尔、牙克石等工业城市，并在林区和草原上出现了一批新兴城镇，促进了自治区经济文化的发展。内蒙古自治区各民族人民，对国家工业和铁路的建设，从各方面积极主动地进行了支援，今后必须更好地加强这方面的工作，以保证国家在自治区的各项建设完满实现。
    随着农牧业生产的发展和国家大工业的兴建，地方工业已迅速发展起来。在发展地方工业中，我们贯彻执行了为农牧业生产服务、为城乡人民生活的需要服务、为国家大工业建设服务的方针。现在已经初步形成新式农具、牧具的制造和修配网，支援了农牧业生产和社会主义改造；建立了一批乳品加工厂、若干革毛制造厂和两个近代化肉类联合加工厂。为了满足城乡人民和国家的需要，发展了采煤、盐、碱、食品、云母、石棉等工业；为了满足大工业及交通运输业的需要，发展了一批建筑材料及其他协作工业。此外，我们还恢复和发展了手工业，适当满足了农牧民生产和城乡人民生活用品的需要。
    在民族地区发展国营商业和合作社营商业，不但是一项重要经济任务，而且是体现党的民族政策的一项重要政治任务。在国民经济恢复时期和计划经济建设时期，我们都以极大的努力发展了国营商业和合作社营商业。国营商业与合作社营商业，深入到广大的城镇、农村、牧区和林区，贯彻了公平合理的价格政策，执行了有时虽有赔累也要收购农、牧、猎民的土特产品，并供给他们生产、生活必需品的方针，使贸易合作事业成为工、农、牧相互支援的纽带。
    随着生产建设的恢复发展和计划经济建设的进行，文化教育卫生事业也有了很大发展。十年来，恢复、整顿和发展了小学和中等学校，有计划地创办了高等学校，大力发展了民族语文，大量出版了民族语文书籍，积极开展了社会教育、职工业余教育和民族体育运动，培养了新的文艺干部，发展了文化艺术事业。基本上控制了曾经严重危害人民生命的鼠疫。对性病患者普遍进行了治疗，促进了人口生育率的增长，改变了蒙古族及区内少数民族人口剧烈下降的情况，出现了人口日益兴旺的新气象。在经济、文化建设事业逐步发展，职工劳动生产率不断提高的基础上，全区各民族人民的物质、文化生活水平，得到了显著提高。
    在经济、文化建设工作中，曾经发生和仍然存在着的主要问题是：缺乏周密的、系统的调查研究，有些工作不能很好地根据民族的和地区的特点来贯彻执行党和国家总的方针、政策，有时往往发生搬用别的地区的工作经验的偏向。对各项事业中贯彻执行党和国家的民族政策的情况缺少定期的检查，对某些违反民族政策的现象，没有能够及时发现和纠正。对区内少数民族地区建设方面的特殊需要，了解不够。在某些建设事业上，由于领导上没有全面地考虑需要和可能，没有能够经常地及时总结经验，提高干部，因而一个时候发生右倾保守偏向；另一个时候又发生盲目冒进的偏向。对国家在内蒙古自治区举办的工业建设的发展速度估计不足，具体的组织领导落后于实际工作发展的需要。所有这些，主要是我们在领导重点转向经济建设之后，具体的组织工作和政治思想工作没有跟上去而造成的。其中有些缺点或错误，由于我们领导和干部都缺少经验，是难以完全避免的。
    大量培养蒙古民族和其他民族干部，为实现各项任务提供了决定性条件
    大量培养和放手使用蒙古族和其他民族干部，是胜利完成自治区各项任务的决定条件。
    十年来，我们采取了各种办法培养干部。在推行区域自治的准备时期，依靠一批蒙汉族老干部为领导，采取办学校和训练班的办法，训练和培养了一批蒙古族青年知识分子干部。自治区成立后，把经过培养的大批干部投入到解放战争和各种群众运动中去，使他们得到锻炼和提高。在这个时期，并把群众斗争中涌现出来的大批优秀分子培养成为基层干部。
    在经济建设时期，为适应自治区各项工作发展的需要，我们开办了各种学校和训练班，系统地提高了在职干部的政治理论和业务水平，训练培养了大批各民族的干部和文化科学技术人材。十年来全区已培养出各民族干部共十三万人，其中蒙古族干部两万人，区内少数民族干部四千八百余人。这些干部已成为自治区各项工作中的骨干，有许多人已经担任了各项领导工作。
    开展民族地区的工作，必须有一批质量较高的老干部作骨干，这在开辟工作时尤为必要。在大力培养蒙古民族干部和少数民族干部的同时，也必须注意培养当地汉族干部。随着工作的发展，还需要区外的汉族干部参加自治区工作，我们应该热烈欢迎他们。但是由于历史上遗留下来的大汉族主义思想对他们还有一定影响，有些人刚到内蒙古自治区工作时，往往不自觉地程度不同地流露大民族的优越感，在工作中容易发生包办代替、急躁和搬用汉族经验的毛病。有的同志还难免有“作客思想”。对于这些同志，必须耐心地帮助他们，使他们在工作中同广大的内蒙古人民建立起深厚的感情，专心一意地为内蒙古人民服务。
    加强蒙汉干部的团结，是蒙汉人民团结的关键。我们采取了批评和自我批评的方法，教育汉族干部，克服大汉族主义的思想残余，从各方面切实尊重和帮助蒙古民族干部，虚心向他们学习，尊重蒙古族和区内少数民族人民的风俗习惯。同时也教育蒙古族干部，热诚欢迎汉族干部的帮助，对那种认为没有汉族人民和干部的帮助，也一样建设内蒙古自治区的思想情绪，以及各种地方民族主义的思想残余，不断地给予了批判。
    要彻底解决内蒙古民族问题，没有大批的蒙古民族和区内其他民族出身的共产主义干部是不可能的。十年来，随着各项工作的开展，我们在蒙古民族和区内其他民族人民中，发展了大批的共产党员，建立了党的组织，加强了党的领导。在发展共产党组织的同时，建立与发展了工会、青年团、妇联及其他人民团体的组织。通过这些组织，对各民族干部和人民群众反复地进行了党的民族政策和爱国主义、国际主义的宣传教育，不断地增强了各民族之间与民族内部的团结，保证了自治区各项建设事业的顺利发展。
    全国各民族人民，正在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛泽东主席的领导下，为把我们的祖国建设成为一个伟大的、先进的、工业化的国家而奋斗。在祖国各民族人民的这一共同事业中，我们内蒙古自治区的基本任务是：广泛深入地发动与组织自治区各民族、各阶层人民，在国家统一计划下，集中一切力量，进一步发展自治区的经济、文化建设事业；大力加强国家在内蒙古自治区兴办的工业建设的领导和支援；在生产不断发展的基础上，逐步提高各民族人民的物质、文化生活。经过几个五年计划，使自治区各民族共同提高到先进民族的水平，同祖国各民族人民一道过渡到社会主义社会。这是彻底改变自治区面貌，根本解决民族问题的极其繁重而光荣的任务。过去十年所获得的成就，仅仅为完成上述任务奠定了初步基础。今后的路程还很长，任务更艰巨，我们不能有丝毫的自满。
    在建设社会主义祖国和内蒙古自治区的前进道路中，一定会有不少困难，但只要我们认真地总结经验教训，加强学习，改进作风，充分利用各种有利条件，千方百计地克服各种困难，我们就能更快更好地推动自治区的各项建设事业大踏步地前进。当前我们的任务是：继续深入贯彻执行党和国家的民族政策，消除大民族主义和地方民族主义的思想残余，不断地及时检查各方面贯彻执行民族政策的情况，随时解决存在的问题；正确地处理人民内部的各种矛盾；从组织上、政治上、思想上进一步巩固社会主义制度，彻底完成社会主义改造；全面开展群众性的增产节约运动，争取农牧业大丰收，完成与超额完成1957年的各项生产建设计划，为第二个五年计划打下良好的基础，并作好必要的准备。
    让我们全区各民族人民更加亲密团结起来，在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛泽东主席的英明领导下，沿着祖国建设社会主义的总轨道奋勇前进！
