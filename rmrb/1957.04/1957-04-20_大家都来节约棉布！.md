The state has made tremendous efforts in developing cotton textile production over the past few years to solve the clothing problem for the nation's 600 million people. In 1949, China produced 55.07 million bolts of cotton cloth, which increased to 174.89 million bolts in 1956. This production volume is more than twice the pre-war 1936 cotton cloth production (81.25 million bolts). In terms of cotton cloth supply, 1956 was also the year with the largest market supply, reaching 173.65 million bolts, of which 149.48 million bolts were for civilian use (excluding market supply of clothing fabric), which is more than three times the 1949 market supply for civilian use (40.88 million bolts). In the more than seven years since the founding of New China, the growth rate of cotton cloth production and market supply is unparalleled in old China.

Due to the rapid development of cotton cloth production, the clothing situation of the broad masses of working people in our country has been fundamentally changed. Today, whether in cities or in the countryside, the extreme poverty of being ragged, several people sharing a cotton coat, or a family sharing a cotton quilt is rare. Today, in the families of ordinary working people in our country, several sets of clothes and stacks of quilts have become common phenomena. People only need to calculate the amount of cotton cloth they have consumed in the past few years and compare it with the pre-liberation period to see how significant the change in clothing is. Naturally, the cotton cloth consumption level of the people of our country is generally not high, and they have the right to demand that the state supply a larger quantity, more varieties, and better-looking cotton cloth to further solve their clothing problems. In fact, the state is moving in this direction.

However, this year's situation is somewhat different from previous years. Due to the natural disasters that affected a large area of our country last year, cotton production decreased, and the supply of raw materials needed by textile factories is insufficient. In addition, cotton cloth sales were too high last year, so this year's cotton cloth production and supply plan has to be reduced compared to last year. This has created a contradiction between cotton cloth production and supply and the people's growing needs. Considering the inevitable reduction in cotton cloth production this year, the State Council has now decided to halve the use of this year's second batch of cloth coupons (from May 1 to August 31, 1957) to balance the difference between cotton cloth production and consumption. This, of course, reduces the amount of cotton cloth supplied this year. However, this year's supply is still higher than in 1955. Although this measure will cause some inconvenience to some consumers in terms of summer fabric use, it can basically guarantee the winter fabric use. On the contrary, if the government does not take effective measures to control the sales of summer cotton cloth now, it will inevitably be impossible to guarantee the supply when the people need cotton cloth the most in winter, which will inevitably cause difficulties that are much more serious than the current ones. Weighing the pros and cons, this approach is obviously much better.

How should everyone deal with this matter? There can be two attitudes. One attitude is: to fully understand the temporary difficulties in the state's supply of cotton cloth, to enthusiastically cooperate with the measures taken by the state, and, based on the new measures and in the spirit of thrift and simplicity, to specifically and meticulously re-arrange one's own and one's family's cotton cloth consumption plan—if there are old ones, buy less or no new ones; if there are broken ones, try to repair them and use them again. In this way, although the amount of cloth supplied by the state in the second period this year is reduced, the difficulties can still be overcome. We believe that this attitude is correct. If people do this, the existing cotton cloth can be used to meet the needs of those who need cotton cloth most urgently, and the tension in cotton cloth supply can be alleviated.

The other attitude is the opposite of what was said earlier: upon hearing that the supply of summer cotton cloth is to be reduced, they complain about the government without asking why or analyzing it; and regardless of whether they need it or not, they blindly rush to exchange all the cloth coupons in their hands for cotton cloth and store it up. If everyone adopts this attitude to exchange and buy, it will create artificial chaos in economic life and will inevitably cause losses to the interests of the vast number of consumers. It should be understood that cotton cloth is not like food: one cannot work without eating for a day, but the flexibility of using cotton cloth is very high. An article of clothing can usually be worn for several years, and it can still be worn after being worn out and repaired. There is a Chinese saying: "New for three years, old for three years, patching and mending for another three years." We do not require every piece of clothing to be worn for nine years, but this simple spirit should still be promoted today. In the past few years, the broad masses have successively purchased a lot of clothes and bedding, some of which have not been fully utilized. If everyone makes full use of these clothes, it is entirely possible to buy less cotton cloth, or even not buy cotton cloth, from May to August this year.

At present, many industrial and mining enterprises also have great potential to tap in saving industrial fabric. For example, the Shanghai Rubber Factory uses high-top sneaker lining fabric that is on average seven centimeters wider than the shoe upper fabric, and low-top sneakers are also two centimeters wider. The factory treats the remaining material after cutting as waste. If the cotton cloth production department produces fabric with a width that matches the specifications of the sneakers, it would be equivalent to saving fabric for 700,000 pairs of high-top sneakers and 600,000 pairs of low-top sneakers each year. If the clothing industry in Beijing can improve cutting, it is estimated that at least 6,000 bolts of cloth can be saved this year. In some government agencies, organizations, enterprises, and schools, there is also serious waste of public fabric. Among the 13,752 feet of fabric purchased by the Fuxin Mining Technical School from September to December last year, 8,618 feet could have been used later or not at all. For example, the school made 2,000 curtains that were pressed in the warehouse and not used, which is obviously a waste. As long as the masses are mobilized to think of more ways and quickly take some measures, a lot of cotton cloth can be saved.

Immediate interests must be subordinated to long-term interests, and the interests of individual consumers must be subordinated to the overall interests of the country. The staff and masses in urban and rural areas across the country, as well as activists, should immediately mobilize to explain the truth to the general public, prevent misunderstandings, and call on everyone to jointly respond to the call of the People's Government. We believe that the broad masses of patriotic compatriots will fully cooperate with the government to overcome the temporary difficulties in the current cotton cloth supply. The phenomenon of a small number of state agencies and state employees illegally purchasing cloth by taking advantage of their positions must be resolutely stopped. Commercial departments must also strengthen control over the supply of temporary and public fabric. In some areas, merchants are taking advantage of loopholes to buy and sell cloth coupons and profit from them. For the benefit of the people of the whole country, this phenomenon must also be resolutely stopped.

### 大家都来节约棉布！

    大家都来节约棉布！
    国家为了解决全国六亿人口的穿衣问题，几年来在发展棉纺织业生产方面做了巨大的努力。1949年我国生产棉布的数量是五千五百零七万匹，到1956年已经达到一亿七千四百八十九万匹。这个产量相当于战前1936年棉布产量（八千一百二十五万匹）两倍多。在棉布供应方面，1956年也是供应市场最多的一年，达到一亿七千三百六十五万匹，其中民用布为一亿四千九百四十八万匹（不包括市场供应服装用布数字），等于1949年供应市场民用布（四千零八十八万匹）的三倍多。新中国成立七年多的时间里，棉布的生产和市场供应的增长速度，是旧中国所无法比拟的。
    由于棉布生产的迅速发展，我国广大劳动人民的衣着情况已经从根本上改观了。今天，不论是在城市或在农村，衣衫褴褛、几个人伙穿一件棉衣、一家人伙盖一床棉被的极端穷困现象已经很少。今天，在我国普通劳动人民的家庭里，衣服几身，被子成叠，已经成了大量的寻常的现象。人们只要把自己几年来消费的棉布计算一下，同解放以前作个比较，就会发现衣着的变化是多么显著。自然，我国人民的棉布消费水平一般地说来还是不高的，他们有权利要求国家供应数量更大、品种更多、花色更好的棉布，好进一步解决自己的穿衣问题。事实上，国家也正在沿着这个方向前进。
    但是，今年的情况同往年有些不同。由于我国去年在较大范围内遭受了自然灾害，棉花减收，纺织工厂所需要的原料供应不足；再加上去年棉布销售过多，今年的棉布生产和供应计划不得不比去年有所削减。这就使得棉布生产和供应同人民日益增长的需要之间产生了矛盾。国务院考虑到今年棉布生产势必减少这一趋势，现在决定将今年第二期布票（从1957年5月1日到8月31日）按对折使用，以便平衡棉布的生产和消费之间的差额。这当然使今年棉布供应数量有了一些削减。但是今年的供应量比起1955年来，还是增加了。这一措施虽然会使一部分消费者在夏季用布上感到一些不便，但是可以基本上保证冬季的用布。相反，如果现在政府不采取有效的措施控制夏季棉布销量，到了冬季人民最需要棉布的时候，就必然无法保证供应，就必然造成比现在严重得多的困难。利害相较，这个办法显然是好得多。
    大家应该用怎样的态度来对待这件事呢？可以有两种态度。一种态度是：对国家供应棉布上的暂时困难充分谅解，对国家采取的措施热诚合作，根据新的办法，本着节约朴素的精神，具体地把自己和自己家庭消费棉布的计划重新做一次细致的安排——有旧的，就少买或不买新的；有破的，就尽量修整再用。这样，虽然今年第二期国家供应的布少了，困难还是可以克服。我们认为，这种态度是正确的。人们都这样做，就可以使现有的棉布能够用来满足最迫切需要棉布的人，棉布供应的紧张状态就可以得到缓和。
    另一种态度是同前面所说的相反：听说要削减夏季棉布的供应，就不问情由、不加分析地埋怨政府；也不问有无需要，就盲目地抢着把手里的布票全部换买成棉布存起来。如果大家都抱这种态度来换买，结果就会在经济生活中造成人为的混乱，就必然会对广大消费者的利益造成损失。要知道，棉布不像粮食：一天不吃饭就不能劳动，但是用布多少的伸缩性却很大。一件衣裳在通常的情况下可以穿好几年，而且穿旧了再改改补补还可以穿。中国有句俗话：“新三年，旧三年，缝缝补补又三年。”我们并不要求件件衣服穿九年，但这种朴素的精神在今天仍然是应该提倡的。几年来，广大群众都陆续置备了不少的衣服、被褥，其中有些还没有充分利用。如果每个人都把这些衣物尽量利用起来，今年5月到8月少买棉布，甚至不买棉布，是完全可以办得到的。
    当前许多工矿企业，在节约工业用布方面也还有很大的潜力可挖。例如上海橡胶厂使用的高腰球鞋夹里布比鞋面布平均宽出七公分，矮腰球鞋也宽二公分，该厂剪裁后的余料都被当作废料处理了。如果棉布生产部门根据球鞋的规格生产宽度相适应的布，就等于每年节约七十万双高腰球鞋和六十万双矮腰球鞋的用布。北京的服装行业如果都能改进裁剪，估计今年至少可以节约六千匹布。在一些机关、团体、企业和学校当中，也还有严重浪费公共用布的现象。阜新矿技工学校在去年9月到12月购置的一万三千七百五十二尺用布中，有八千六百十八尺是可以缓用或不用的。如该校做了二千个窗帘压在仓库里不用，这显然是一种浪费。只要发动群众多想办法，迅速采取一些措施，就可以节约很多的棉布。
    眼前利益要服从长远利益，各个消费者的利益要服从国家的整个利益。全国城乡的工作人员和群众中的积极分子，应该立即动员起来，向广大居民讲清道理，防止误会，号召大家共同响应人民政府的号召。我们相信，广大的爱国同胞一定会同政府充分合作，来克服目前棉布供应中的暂时困难。有少数国家机关和国家工作人员利用职权之便违法购布，这种现象必须坚决制止。商业部门对临时用布和公共用布的供应，也要加强控制。有些地区商贩钻空子，买卖布票，从中牟利。为了全国人民的利益，这种现象也必须坚决制止。
