    Do Not Waste and Abandon Farmland

    Occupy as Little Farmland as Possible

    I have traveled through several county towns and have seen that most units occupy a lot of farmland and construction is very unplanned. For example, in Xiacun, the location of the People's Committee of Rushan County, Shandong Province, the County People's Committee and the County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party have been newly built at the eastern end of Xiacun, which is a fertile piece of farmland. Two rows of houses, seven buildings in front and behind, occupy no less than sixty acres of land, and the sidewalk is as wide as fifteen meters. One mile east of the County People's Committee is Rushan No. 1 Middle School, which also occupies more than one hundred acres of land. The northeast corner of Xiacun is the location of the County Branch of the Bank, the Broadcasting Station, the Film Team, and other institutions. Another mile or so northeast is the newly built hospital. The bus station is built in the southwest corner of Xiacun. From a distance, the newly built red-tiled houses are scattered around Xiacun, like a few sparse stars in the dawn sky. I cannot say exactly how much farmland around Xiacun has been occupied, but it is at least within three hundred acres. The unplanned construction of various units at the residence of the Rushan County People's Committee seems to be aimed at building this village of less than ten thousand people into a city of tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people, without considering the issue of saving farmland at all. Another example is Laiyang No. 1 Middle School, which is just an ordinary middle school, but the school site occupies more than two hundred acres of land, and the open space in the middle is no less than thirty acres. What is the necessity of this? Now some government offices are building dormitories on nearby farmland. I think it would be better to allocate funds to Laiyang No. 1 Middle School to build student dormitories using the open space within the school, and allocate the current student dormitories to the units that want to build new dormitories. In short, I hope that local governments can control this aspect, and try to ensure that newly built units are laid out according to plan and occupy as little farmland as possible, especially fertile farmland.

    Let Out Unused Land

    At the end of February, when I participated in the joint inspection of the spring plowing and preparation work of the Wanfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Wanshousi Village, Western Suburbs of Beijing, when passing by the back door of the Kindergarten of the Ministry of Agriculture, the members of the cooperative pointed to the wasteland inside the door and said to me, "These eighty acres of good vegetable garden land have been abandoned for two years, it's a real pity!" The cooperative cadre continued, "Our cooperative wanted to plant this land the year before last, but they replied that they were going to build and would not let us plant it. We negotiated several times last year, but they didn't agree." I recently learned that the Kindergarten of the Ministry of Agriculture has not yet handed it over.

    On the land of the Fifth Production Team, there is also a lot of land that was requisitioned by the Central Youth League School, which had not yet been autumn-plowed at that time. However, later the Youth League School returned it to the farmers for cultivation.

    In the western suburbs, there are still many cases of agencies requisitioning land but not using it, leaving the land barren. They have not considered how to let farmers utilize these lands when the Party calls for doing everything possible to increase agricultural production. This is not right. Especially this year, the basic construction plan has been reduced, and the amount of land decided not to be used has increased, the relevant departments should notify the government and relevant agricultural cooperatives to recover the land for cultivation as soon as possible.

### 不要浪费和荒废耕地

    不要浪费和荒废耕地
    尽量少占耕地
    我走过几个县城，看见多数单位都占了很多耕地，建设很无计划。如山东乳山县人民委员会的所在地夏村，县人民委员会和中共县委新建在夏村的东端，那里是一片肥沃的耕地，两行房屋前后七幢，占地不下六十多亩，人行道也足有十五公尺宽。由县人民委员会向东一里地，是乳山第一中学，也占地百余亩。夏村东北角，是县支行、广播站、电影队等机关的所在地。再往东北约一里地，是新建的医院。而汽车站则建在夏村的西南角。远处看去，新建的几处红瓦房，散在夏村周围，真像拂晓时天空稀疏的几颗星。夏村周围究竟占去了多少耕地，我不能确切的说出，但至少不在三百亩以内。乳山县人民委员会的驻地各单位无计划地乱建，似乎要把这个不足万人的村庄，建设成为几万人或几十万人的城市，而根本没有考虑过节约耕地的问题。又如莱阳县第一中学，仅是一个普通中学，校址占地有二百多亩，中间空地也不在三十亩以下。这又有什么必要呢？现在又有一些机关在附近的耕地上兴建宿舍。我看很可以拨款给莱阳第一中学利用校内空地建设学生宿舍，而把现在的学生宿舍拨给要新建宿舍的单位。总之，我希望各地政府能在这方面加以控制，设法使新建单位按计划的布局，尽量少占耕地，尤其少占肥沃的耕地。

    把不用的土地让出来
    2月底，我参加北京西郊万寿寺村万丰农业社的春播备耕工作的联合检查的时候，经过农业部幼儿园的后门，社员们指着门内那片荒地对我说：“这八十亩好菜园地，已经荒了两年了，真可惜！”社干部接着说：“前年咱社想种这块地，可是人家回答说要建设，不让种。去年又交涉了好几次，也没答应。”我最近了解，农业部幼儿园至今还没有交出来。
    在第五生产队的土地上，也有不少的土地是中央团校征用的，当时还没有秋耕。但是，后来团校已经交还给农民耕种了。
    在西郊，机关征用而又未用、一任土地荒芜的事还不少，他们在党号召千方百计增加农业生产的时候，还没有考虑如何让农民能利用这些土地。这是不应该的。特别今年基本建设计划削减了，决定不用的土地增多了，有关部门即应尽快通知政府和有关农业社收回耕种。
