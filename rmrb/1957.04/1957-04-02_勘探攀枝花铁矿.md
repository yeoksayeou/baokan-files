Prospecting the Panzhihua Iron Mine
Geological exploration personnel are prospecting an iron ore deposit in the Panzhihua area of Sichuan Province. The proven reserves of this iron ore deposit are about 500 million tons. The main ore body is 15 kilometers long, and the thickest ore layer is more than 100 meters. It is currently the largest iron ore deposit in Southwest China. The average grade of the ore is above 40%.

This large-scale iron ore deposit is sufficient to establish a huge steel base. If calculated based on a steel plant smelting 1.5 million tons of steel annually, it can provide ore resources for more than 100 years. In the past, most of the steel required for key construction projects in the Southwest relied on supplies from the Northeast and Central China. In the future, the exploitation of the Panzhihua iron ore deposit will lay the foundation for the development of industry in the Southwest.

    勘探攀枝花铁矿
    地质勘探人员正在四川省的攀枝花地区勘探一个铁矿。这个铁矿已探明储量为五亿吨左右，主矿长有十五公里，矿层最厚的有一百多公尺，是目前西南最大的一个铁矿。矿石的平均品位在40％以上。
    这个大型铁矿，足够建立一个巨大的钢铁基地。如果以每年冶炼一百五十万吨的钢铁厂计算，它可以提供一百年以上的矿石资源。过去，西南各项重点建设所需的钢铁大部靠东北和华中供应，今后，攀枝花大铁矿的开采，将为西南工业的发展打下基础。
