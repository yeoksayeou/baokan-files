    Sun Guiying Smiled
    Yao Yuangao
    At a little past 11:00 a.m. on March 30th, Sun Guiying, a service worker in the mother and infant waiting room at Benxihu Station, was getting hot water for mothers and infants when she met an old woman with white hair and a worried face, constantly shedding tears. Sun Guiying stepped forward to ask what was wrong. It turned out that the old woman had come from Jiaoxian County, Shandong Province, to Benxi City to find her son. She had been here for three or four days and hadn't found him, and the money she had was down to only 4 jiao and 5 fen.

    Sun Guiying sympathized with the old woman's plight. She asked the old woman for the bottom of her son's letter, and upon looking at it, she discovered that the old woman's son was located at the "First Cooperative Barber Shop, Nanfen Street, Nanfen District, Benxi City." Nanfen was sixty li away from Benxihu, how could this old woman find her way there?

    Sun Guiying immediately comforted the old woman, helped her into the mother and infant waiting room, advised her to rest easy, and used her own lunch money to buy the old woman a piece of bread. After settling the old woman down, she called Nanfen Station and asked them to help find him. Finally, with the help of comrades at Nanfen Station, the old woman's son was found.

    The next train to Nanfen was about to depart. Sun Guiying thought that in just over an hour, this old woman would be able to see her son, and a happy smile appeared on her face. (Attached picture)

    孙桂英笑了
    姚元高
    3月30日上午十一点多钟，本溪湖车站母婴候车室服务员孙桂英在给母婴旅客取开水时，在候车室遇见了一位白发苍苍的老大娘，满面愁容，不断流泪。孙桂英上前一问，原来这位老大娘由山东胶县来本溪市找儿子的，到这儿已三、四天，没有找到儿子，而身边的钱已花得只剩四角五分了。
    孙桂英很同情这个老大娘的遭遇。她向老大娘要来她儿子的信底，一看，发现老大娘的儿子所在的地方是“本溪市南芬区南芬街第一合作理发社”。南芬离本溪湖还有六十里，这叫老大娘上那儿去找呢？
    孙桂英马上安慰了这位老大娘，把老大娘扶到母婴候车室里，劝她安心休息，并用自己的午饭钱给老大娘买了一个面包。把老大娘安顿好了以后，就挂电话和南芬站联系，请他们给找一找。终于，在南芬站同志的协助下，找到了老大娘的儿子。
    下一次往南芬方面去的列车开动了，孙桂英想到这个老大娘再过一个多钟头就能看到儿子了，脸上露出了愉快的笑容。（附图片）
