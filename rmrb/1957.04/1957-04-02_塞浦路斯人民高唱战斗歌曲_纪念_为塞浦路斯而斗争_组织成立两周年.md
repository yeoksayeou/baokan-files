    Cypriots Sing Battle Songs to Commemorate the Second Anniversary of the Founding of the "Struggle for Cyprus" Organization
    Xinhua News Agency, Nicosia, 1st.—On March 31st, thousands of Cypriots here went to churches to commemorate the second anniversary of the founding of the "Struggle for Cyprus" organization, and at the same time mourned the fifty-seven fighters who were shot and killed by British troops in the past two years for fighting for Cyprus to join Greece. Despite the large number of British troops densely surrounding the churches, people still shouted anti-British slogans and sang battle songs.
    The "Struggle for Cyprus" organization and the "Struggle for Cyprus Political Committee" distributed leaflets calling on people to stop all forms of entertainment on the 31st to commemorate the anniversary. The leaflet said: April 1, 1955, will be recorded in Greek history. The leaflet firmly stated that "the struggle for freedom will continue until the ultimate goal is achieved."

    纪念“为塞浦路斯而斗争”组织成立两周年
    新华社1日讯　尼科西亚消息：3月31日这里成千的塞浦路斯人走向教堂，纪念“为塞浦路斯而斗争”组织成立两周年，同时哀悼两年来为争取塞浦路斯并入希腊而被英军枪杀的五十七位战士。尽管有大批英军密布在教堂周围，人们仍然高呼反英口号，歌唱着战斗的歌曲。
    “为塞浦路斯而斗争”组织和“为塞浦路斯而斗争政治委员会”散发了传单，号召人们在31日停止一切形式的娱乐来纪念这个周年纪念日。传单说：1955年4月1日将记载在希腊的历史上。传单坚决表示，“争取自由的斗争定将继续，直到最后达到目的为止。”
