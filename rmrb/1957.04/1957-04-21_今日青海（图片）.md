Today's Qinghai
Qinghai Province is located in the northeastern part of the Kangzang Plateau and is the source of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers. More than two million people of various ethnic groups, including Tibetan, Han, Mongolian, Hui, Salar, Tu, and Kazakh, live in the province.

Qinghai Province's animal husbandry is developing rapidly. The province now has 15 million head of livestock, more than double the number before liberation. Thanks to the construction of various water conservancy projects, more than 270,000 mu of dry land have been converted into irrigated land. Qinghai Province is particularly rich in natural resources and underground mineral deposits. Natural salt reserves are in the tens of billions of tons. Oil reserves in the Qaidam Basin alone have more than one hundred discovered oil-bearing structures. In terms of industrial and transportation construction and cultural and educational undertakings, there has also been great development in recent years. A large number of local ethnic minority cadres have grown up. The rich and beautiful Qinghai has the potential to become a new base for China's petroleum and chemical industries.

    今日青海
    青海省位于康藏大高原的东北部，是长江、黄河发源地。全省居住着包括有藏、汉、蒙古、回、撒拉、土、哈萨克等各族人民二百多万。
    青海省畜牧业发展很快，全省牲畜现有一千五百万头，比解放前增加一倍多。由于兴修了各种水利工程，已有二十七万多亩旱地变为水地。青海省天然资源和地下矿藏尤为丰富，天然食盐蕴藏量有数百亿吨；石油蕴藏在柴达木盆地一处，就已发现有一百个以上的储油构造。在工业交通建设和文化教育事业方面，几年来也有很大发展。当地少数民族干部已大批成长。富饶美丽的青海有条件成为我国石油和化学工业新的基地。
