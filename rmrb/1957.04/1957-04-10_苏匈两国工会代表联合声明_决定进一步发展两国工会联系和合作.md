    苏匈两国工会代表联合声明
    决定进一步发展两国工会联系和合作
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社报道：匈牙利工会代表团应全苏工会中央理事会的邀请，在3月28日到4月8日访问了苏联。
    访问期间，匈牙利自由工会全国联合会的代表和全苏工会中央理事会的代表就进一步发展两国工会的联系和合作以及加强匈苏两国劳动人民的友谊问题进行了会谈。
    会谈后双方发表联合声明，表示完全拥护两国政府和党的代表团不久以前在莫斯科发表的宣言和声明中所规定的措施，并且将尽一切力量来帮助这些措施的实现。双方一致认为，两国政府和党的代表团之间在莫斯科举行的会谈，促进了社会主义阵营的进一步团结和匈苏两国人民友谊的加强。
    联合声明表示，双方将通过扩大工会和工人代表团的来往、发展同类企业劳动人民集体间的联系、经常交换反映两国工会活动和两国劳动人民生活情况的资料等方式，来进一步扩大两国工会之间的兄弟合作。同时，两国工会将继续积极参加世界工会联合会的活动，并且同没有加入世界工联的那些维护劳动人民利益和拥护加强国际和平的工会组织发展联系，以加强国际工人阶级的团结。
    匈牙利工会代表团已经在8日离苏回国。
