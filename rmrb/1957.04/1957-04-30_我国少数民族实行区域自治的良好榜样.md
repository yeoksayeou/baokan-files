A Good Example of Ethnic Regional Autonomy in Our Country

May 1st of this year marks the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the earliest region in our country to implement ethnic regional autonomy. Over the past decade, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has achieved great successes in various tasks, and its social and ethnic outlooks have undergone fundamental changes. This is a great victory for the Party's ethnic policy and a great victory for the people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

In the ten years since the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, with the development of the national revolution and construction and the maturity of various conditions, the Inner Mongolia region has gradually realized a unified autonomous region. The entire former Suiyuan Province and the Mongolian areas of the former Rehe and Gansu provinces were successively placed under the jurisdiction of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, ending the state of division of the Inner Mongolia nationality for more than 300 years. The Inner Mongolia nation is united unprecedentedly. The relations between the fraternal ethnic groups within the autonomous region, especially between the Mongolian and Han ethnic groups, have also changed from the past relations of national oppression, estrangement, and discrimination to new relations of national equality, close unity, mutual assistance, and common development. Other ethnic groups in the autonomous region besides the Mongolian and Han, such as the Oroqen and Daur, though small in number, also enjoy equal national rights.

In the process of promoting ethnic regional autonomy, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region carried out various democratic reforms, implemented land reform in agricultural areas, abolished feudal privileges in pastoral areas, and implemented policies such as free grazing and mutual benefit for herdsmen and herdowners. During the high tide of socialist transformation across the country, the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce has also achieved a decisive victory; the socialist transformation of animal husbandry is also being carried out actively and steadily. Now the socialist ownership system has taken absolute dominance in the entire autonomous region, and the socialist system has been basically established.

The realization of a unified autonomous region, the unity of all ethnic groups and within ethnic groups, and the victory of democratic reform and socialist transformation have created extremely favorable conditions for the economic and cultural development of the Inner Mongolia region.

Ten years ago, the Inner Mongolia region had basically no industry; now it has 823 factories of various sizes. In 1956, the industrial output value accounted for more than 27% of the total industrial and agricultural output value of the entire autonomous region. The Greater Khingan Mountains area in the northeast of the autonomous region has become an important forest industrial base of the motherland, and the area near Baotou will be built into a huge iron and steel industrial base. The entire autonomous region has formed a modern transportation network with more than 2,600 kilometers of railways as its backbone. In agriculture, the total grain output in 1956 reached more than 4,557,000 tons, an increase of one and a half times compared with 1946. The number of various livestock reached more than 26 million, an increase of more than two times compared with 1946. Comparing 1956 with 1946, the number of various schools increased by 4.7 times, and the total number of students increased by 5.5 times; the number of medical and health institutions increased by 37 times. Due to the development of health services and the improvement of people's lives, the Mongolian population has increased by more than 200,000 in the past decade, reversing the downward trend.

Ten years is a short period in history, but the face of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has been completely changed, presenting a vigorous and prosperous new atmosphere everywhere. The national prosperity that the Inner Mongolia nation has long dreamed of is being gradually realized.

The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is an inseparable part of our motherland, and the achievements of the Inner Mongolia region are also part of the achievements of the motherland's socialist cause. The victory of the people of Inner Mongolia is also the victory of the people of all ethnic groups in the country. The people of the whole country should be encouraged and rejoice at such brilliant achievements made by the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in such a short period.

However, the achievements of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, like the socialist construction cause of the motherland, have only just laid a foundation. In order to fundamentally change the face of the autonomous region, completely solve the national question, and realize the Party's general task in the national question during the transition period, the tasks in the future are still extremely arduous and difficult. We hope that the people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will consolidate existing achievements, continue to make unremitting efforts, continue to implement the national policy in depth, consolidate the socialist system, thoroughly complete the socialist transformation, further develop industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production, vigorously support the country's key construction projects in the autonomous region, and make greater contributions to the country's socialist cause.

The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is a good example of ethnic regional autonomy in our country. What has the road taken and the brilliant achievements made in the ten years of implementing regional autonomy told us?

First of all, the road taken by the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region over the past ten years specifically proves the greatness and correctness of our country's basic policy for solving the national question—the policy of ethnic regional autonomy. After the implementation of regional autonomy in the Inner Mongolia region, the status and rights of all ethnic groups have been guaranteed, their patriotism and socialist awareness have been raised, their unity has been strengthened, and the people of all ethnic groups have fully displayed their enthusiasm and creativity, greatly promoting the development of various construction undertakings in the autonomous region.

Secondly, the nationalization of ethnic autonomous local organs is an important part of the policy of ethnic regional autonomy. It is an important condition for realizing the self-determination of the ethnic group and for closely connecting the autonomous organs and other organs with the masses of the people. Therefore, after the ethnic minorities implement regional autonomy, it is necessary to vigorously train and promote cadres of their own nationality according to the specific local conditions. When the autonomous organs perform their duties, they must use their own ethnic language or one or several languages commonly used locally. The organizational form of the organs should take a national form, and the nationalization of the autonomous organs should be gradually realized. In the past ten years, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has trained 20,000 Mongolian cadres and more than 4,800 cadres from other ethnic minorities in the region; the Party Committee of the Autonomous Region has also trained a large number of Party member cadres. The state power organs and administrative organs at all levels of the autonomous region, as well as the Party organs, already have a considerable number of members from the Mongolian and other ethnic minorities. The organs at all levels of the autonomous region basically use both Mongolian and Han languages in their work. In other areas where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities, attention has also been paid to the use of the local ethnic minority languages. This has made the organs at all levels in Inner Mongolia more closely connected with the masses, promoted national unity, and thus enabled the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region to give fuller play to their enthusiasm and creativity in socialist construction.

Thirdly, after the ethnic minorities have implemented regional autonomy, it is necessary to vigorously develop economic and cultural undertakings under possible conditions in order to ensure that the ethnic minorities fully enjoy the rights of national equality. The economic and cultural undertakings of ethnic minority areas are part of the construction of the entire country and must be closely coordinated with the construction of the motherland and gradually developed. They cannot be separated from the overall track of national construction. The various construction undertakings of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are carried out in close connection with the unified national plan and have achieved great achievements with the support and assistance of the country.

Fourthly, for ethnic minorities in our country to develop into advanced nations, democratic reforms and socialist transformations must be carried out steadily according to the characteristics of their own nations after conditions are ripe. Because only the socialist system can guarantee a high degree of development for every nation in terms of economy and culture. If the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region does not implement democratic reforms and socialist transformations, the enthusiasm of the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region could not be so high, and the development of production could not be so rapid.

Fifthly, the development of various undertakings of ethnic minorities in our country, in addition to the efforts of their own nations, is impossible without the help of other ethnic groups in the country, mainly the help of the more advanced Han nationality. Therefore, it is necessary to continuously strengthen national unity, overcome the remnants of great Han chauvinism and local nationalism, especially overcome the remnants of great Han chauvinism. The Han nationality has the responsibility to help the ethnic minorities, and the ethnic minorities should also welcome the help of the Han nationality. The various achievements of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are the result of mutual support and joint struggle between the Inner Mongolia nationality and the Han nationality and other ethnic groups.

The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region also has many valuable experiences in implementing ethnic regional autonomy and carrying out various constructions. This year, when celebrating the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the autonomous region, representatives from 16 provinces and autonomous regions across the country were sent to congratulate. It is hoped that representatives from all regions will take this opportunity to learn these experiences well and apply them according to the characteristics of their own ethnic regions. At the same time, the various ethnic minorities in our country also have a lot of rich experience in implementing regional autonomy and other work, and can also take this opportunity to exchange and learn from each other.

Ethnic minority areas in our country, except for a few areas, have all successively implemented ethnic regional autonomy. Due to the different social conditions and economic foundations of the various ethnic autonomous regions in the past, the different timing of implementation of regional autonomy, and the different material conditions (such as transportation, resources, etc.), the degree of development also varies. However, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, in the united and fraternal family of all ethnic groups in the motherland, the political, economic, and cultural undertakings of all ethnic minority autonomous regions will have great development and will gradually transition to a bright and happy socialist society. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is a good example of ethnic regional autonomy in our country.

### 我国少数民族实行区域自治的良好榜样

    我国少数民族实行区域自治的良好榜样
    今年5月1日，是我国最早实行民族区域自治的内蒙古自治区成立十周年纪念日。十年来，内蒙古自治区各项工作获得了巨大成绩，社会面貌、民族面貌已经发生了根本变化。这是党的民族政策的伟大胜利，是内蒙古自治区各族人民的伟大胜利。
    内蒙古自治区成立的十年中，随着全国革命和建设事业的发展，随着各种条件的成熟，内蒙古地区逐步实现了统一的自治区，原绥远省全部和原热河、甘肃的蒙古族聚居区相继划归内蒙古自治区，结束了三百多年来内蒙古民族被分割的状态。内蒙古民族内部空前地团结起来了。自治区内各兄弟民族之间，特别是蒙汉民族之间，也早已经由过去的民族压迫、隔阂、歧视的关系，改变为民族平等、亲密团结、互相帮助、共同发展的新关系。自治区内除蒙古族和汉族以外的其他民族，如鄂伦春族、达呼尔族等，人数虽然很少，但也同样享受民族平等的权利。
    在推行民族区域自治的过程中，内蒙古自治区进行了各项民主改革，在农业区进行了土地改革，在牧业区废除了封建特权，实行自由放牧和牧工、牧主两利等政策。在全国社会主义改造高潮中，对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造也已经取得了决定性的胜利；牧业的社会主义改造也正在积极地稳步地进行。现在全自治区社会主义所有制已经占绝对优势，社会主义制度已经基本上建立起来了。
    统一的自治区的实现，各民族的团结和民族内部的团结，以及民主改革和社会主义改造的胜利，给内蒙古地区经济文化的发展创造了极为有利的条件。
    十年以前，内蒙古地区基本上没有工业，现在有了八百二十三座大小工厂。1956年工业产值已经占全自治区工农业总产值的27％以上。自治区东北部的大兴安岭地区已经成为祖国的一个重要森林工业基地，包头附近则将建设成为一个巨大的钢铁工业基地。全自治区已经形成了以二千六百多公里铁路为主干的近代交通网。在农业方面，1956年粮食总产量达到四百五十五万七千多吨，比1946年增长了一倍半。各种牲畜头数达到二千六百万多头，比1946年增殖二倍多。以1956年同1946年比较，各类学校数增长四点七倍，学生总数增长五点五倍；医疗卫生机构增长了三十七倍。由于卫生事业的发展和人民生活的改善，十年中，蒙古族人口增加了二十多万人，扭转了下降的趋势。
    十年，在历史上是一个短暂的时期，内蒙古自治区的面貌已经完全改观了，处处呈现蓬蓬勃勃、欣欣向荣的新气象。内蒙古民族长期以来梦寐以求的民族繁荣，正在逐步实现。
    内蒙古自治区是我们祖国不可分割的一部分，内蒙古地区的成就，也是祖国社会主义事业成就的一部分，内蒙古人民的胜利也是全国各族人民的胜利。全国人民都应该为内蒙古自治区在短时期中有这样辉煌的成就而欢欣鼓舞。
    但是，内蒙古自治区的成就和祖国社会主义建设事业一样，还只是仅仅有了一个基础。为了根本改变自治区的面貌，彻底解决民族问题，实现过渡时期党在民族问题方面的总任务，今后的任务仍然是极其繁重和艰巨的。我们希望内蒙古自治区各族人民巩固现有的成绩，继续不懈地努力，继续深入贯彻执行民族政策，巩固社会主义制度，彻底完成社会主义改造，进一步发展工、农、牧业生产，大力支援国家在自治区内的各项重点建设工程，为国家社会主义事业做出更大的贡献。
    内蒙古自治区是我国少数民族区域自治的良好榜样。实行区域自治十年来所走的道路和辉煌的成就告诉了我们甚么呢？
    首先，内蒙古自治区十年来所走的道路，具体地证明了我国解决民族问题的基本政策——民族区域自治政策的伟大和正确。内蒙古地区实行区域自治以后，各民族的地位和权利有了保证，提高了爱国主义和社会主义的觉悟，增强了团结，各族人民充分发挥了积极性和创造性，大大推动了自治区内各项建设事业的发展。
    其次，民族自治地方机关民族化是民族区域自治政策的重要部分，是实现本民族当家做主和使自治机关和其他机关密切联系人民群众的重要条件。因此少数民族实行区域自治以后，必须根据当地的具体情况，大力培养和提拔本民族的干部；自治机关执行职务的时候，要使用本民族的语言文字或当地通用的一种或几种语言文字；机关组织形式要采取民族形式，逐步实现自治机关的民族化。内蒙古自治区十年中培养了蒙古族干部两万人和区内其他少数民族干部四千八百多人；自治区党委也培养出大批党员干部。自治区的各级国家权力机关和行政机关，以及党的机关中，都已经有相当数量的蒙古族和其他少数民族成员。自治区各级机关都基本上使用蒙汉两种语言文字进行工作，其他少数民族聚居区，也注意了使用当地少数民族的语言。这就使内蒙古各级机关更密切地联系了群众，促进了民族团结，从而使自治区的各族人民在社会主义建设中，更充分地发挥了积极性和创造性。
    第三，在少数民族实行了区域自治以后，必须在可能条件下大力发展经济文化事业，才能保证少数民族充分享受民族平等权利。少数民族地区的经济文化事业是整个国家建设的一部分，必须同祖国的建设密切配合，逐步发展，不能脱离国家建设总的轨道。内蒙古自治区的各项建设事业就是同国家统一的计划紧密地结合起来进行的，并且在国家的扶持和帮助下，获得了巨大成就的。
    第四，我国少数民族发展成为先进的民族，必须在条件成熟以后，根据本民族的特点，稳步地进行民主改革和社会主义改造。因为只有社会主义制度才能保证每一个民族在经济文化上有高度的发展。内蒙古自治区，如果不实行民主改革和社会主义改造，自治区内各族人民的积极性，就不可能如此高涨，生产的发展也不可能如此迅速。
    第五，我国少数民族各项事业的发展，除本民族自己努力以外，没有国内其他民族的帮助，主要是比较先进的汉族的帮助，也是不可能的。因此必须不断加强民族团结，克服大民族主义和地方民族主义思想残余，特别是克服大民族主义思想残余。汉族有责任帮助少数民族，而少数民族也应该欢迎汉族的帮助。内蒙古自治区各项成就，就是内蒙古民族和汉族及其他各民族相互支援，共同奋斗得来的。
    内蒙古自治区在实行民族区域自治和进行各项建设中，还有许多宝贵的经验。今年在庆祝自治区成立十周年的时候，全国十六个省、自治区都派了代表前往祝贺。希望各地代表们都能够借这个机会，很好地学习这些经验，根据本民族地区的特点，加以运用。同时我国各个少数民族在实行区域自治和其他工作方面也有不少丰富经验，也可以借这个机会互相交流，互相学习。
    我国各个少数民族地区，除个别地区以外，都已经先后实行了民族区域自治。由于各个民族自治地方过去的社会状况和经济基础不同，实行区域自治的早晚不同，物质条件（如交通、资源等）不同，因此发展程度也各有不同。但是在中国共产党的领导下，在祖国各民族团结友爱的大家庭里，各个少数民族自治地方的政治、经济、文化事业，都将有巨大的发展，而逐步过渡到光明幸福的社会主义社会。内蒙古自治区就是我国各个少数民族实行区域自治的良好榜样。
