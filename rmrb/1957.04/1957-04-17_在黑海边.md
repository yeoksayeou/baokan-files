    By the Black Sea
    Jin Yi
    We once sat in a speedboat, dashing across the chest of the Black Sea—the not-so-cold and humid sea breeze blowing on us, the splashing waves like fine rain patting our faces, the soaring seabirds tilting their wings and flying past us, the people on the seashore waving and cheering at us... The sunlight turned the Black Sea water blue, leading us to sail further away. The common knowledge about the Black Sea obtained from books is no longer so convincing, the Black Sea is such a broad, gentle, mother-like lovable sea! Scoop a handful of Black Sea water in your palm, it is also such clear and transparent water!
    Finally, we returned to the beach at the foot of the mountain of the new Sochi Sanatorium. I looked up, the snow-white sanatorium was inlaid in the azure sky like a celestial palace; looking down, the stones constantly washed by the sea water revealed colorful and brilliant lights. My eyes were overwhelmed, my hands were too busy, and soon both pockets were full. The seawater, topped with a snow-white foam, playfully rushed to my feet, and just as I was about to dodge it, it quickly receded. If it were summer, and I were a young man who could swim, I would not hesitate to throw myself into the arms of the Black Sea and swim to my heart's content. But now, it is still winter, and only the unshielded sun makes me feel slightly sleepy. So I walked up a few steps and lay on my back on the beach, which was a little hot from the sun. I covered my eyes with my hands, but through the gaps between my fingers, I stole a glimpse of the blue sky with floating white clouds. Like a distant childhood, I fantasized that it was a galloping horse or a towering mountain. Everything was so harmonious, everything was so beautiful, I unconsciously, vaguely stepped close to the edge of a dream.
    A gentle hand gently patted my shoulder, waking me up. I suddenly sat up, and a kind old woman's face smiled at me:
    "Comrade, don't sleep here, after all, it's still winter, I'm afraid you'll catch a cold!"
    I thanked her and was about to stand up, but she sat down beside me and shook my hand warmly. She told me that she also lived in this sanatorium, and she had already heard that Chinese brothers had arrived. She had even seen us from afar in the dining hall. She told me that her name was Gilanina Maria Grigorievna. She was born at the end of the nineteenth century, and she said with a smile: "I am a person who has lived through two centuries!"
    "Then are you still working?"
    "No, I have retired. I am sixty-two years old this year. I worked for twelve years and worked for the Party and the Soviets for twenty-six years."
    "So, you came here for recuperation because you are not in good health."
    "Not really. Even though we have retired, we still go to sanatoriums every year like workers. I have been to many places. This year the organization wanted me to come to Sochi because the weather here is warm, and old people should spend the winter in warm places."
    She told me that she was born in 1894 in Gus-Khrustalny, two hundred and fifty kilometers from Moscow. The name of this place means "Crystal Goose" because it is famous for making crystal handicrafts; but her family was very poor, her father was a handyman, her mother was a textile worker, and her four sisters were all textile workers. She started working as a textile worker at the age of twelve. In 1914, she participated in a strike for the first time at the Morozov Textile Factory. She said: "Before the revolution, many of us took the same path: if we didn't have food, we fought for the right to live. We moved from economic struggle to political struggle."
    She joined the Party in April 1917, and engaged in women's work between the February Revolution and the October Revolution. Many comrades went to her place, and she accompanied them to various places to carry out propaganda. Before the October Revolution, she was elected as a representative to the District Soviet of Workers', Peasants' and Soldiers' Deputies. During the October Revolution, she joined the workers' armed team and took up arms to fight the enemy.
    I calculated the days, she has been an old Party member for nearly forty years. I once again firmly shook her hand, paying tribute to an old Bolshevik as a young Chinese brother. She said with a smile:
      "I am nothing, I have not done enough work for the Party. There are several people like me in this sanatorium." She paused, "But I participated in the Seventh Party Congress, and Comrade Lenin talked to me, this is the most honorable thing in my life."
    When she said this, a glimpse of happiness and youthful radiance flashed across her face, dragging the years back almost forty years. She said that she was not an official representative, she only attended as a non-voting delegate. The main content of that conference was to discuss the Brest-Litovsk Treaty issue. She was introduced to Comrade Lenin by Comrade Kollontai, whom she had known for a long time, and said that she was a textile worker. She still clearly remembered Comrade Lenin shaking her hand, patting her on the shoulder, and saying: "This is very good, many workers oppose the exploiters, oppose the enemies, we have this power, we are not afraid of anything!" At that time, Bukharin and Trotsky were opposing Comrade Lenin, and she also remembered Comrade Lenin optimistically telling her: "If there are difficulties, use your shoulders to push them away!"
    She said that Comrade Lenin said this sentence, and the appearance of his shoulders moving upwards has always been vividly and clearly engraved in her heart. In her work, whenever she encountered difficulties, she clearly remembered what Comrade Lenin told her and that fearless posture, which gave her great courage and strength, so that she never bowed her head in the face of difficulties. "That's how I pushed the difficulty away!" She imitated Comrade Lenin's appearance, but then she laughed at herself: "I didn't learn it at all, after all, he is the great Lenin, I am just an ordinary female worker."
      She also told me that she had not only seen him in Petersburg at that time, but also at the All-Union Women's Congress. In fact, she said, the eagle-like image of Lenin flashes before her eyes every day, and it is still like this today. She said that in the past, she got courage from Comrade Lenin to fight against domestic and foreign enemies; today, it is to build communism.
    From her conversation, I learned that she volunteered to go to the front line to fight against Denikin in 1919; during the Patriotic War, she also joined the army and served as a cultural commissioner.
    "As long as there are enemies in front of me, I will stand in the Red Army and fight the enemy face to face!"
    She said that she is very happy today, her sons and daughters are either engineers, doctors, or students at the Suvorov Military School. But she does not rely on them for living. The Party and the government give her a pension every month, allowing her to live a comfortable life. She repeatedly asked about the elderly, women and children in China. She is very concerned about Chinese workers, especially female textile workers. I told her as much as I knew. She was very happy. She repeatedly asked me to say hello to the Chinese sisters and congratulate them on shouldering the same responsibilities as men in the construction of the motherland, and congratulate them on promoting the unique perseverance and hard work of women.
    Finally, we stood up. She took out a very large pebble from her pocket and asked for my daughter's name. She wrote with a red pencil: "A souvenir from an old Soviet mother to Chinese daughter Nannan."
    I took it over, it was so heavy and so big, just like the Soviet people's feelings for the Chinese people.

    在黑海边
    靳以
    我们曾坐了一叶快艇，在黑海的胸膛上尽情奔驶——并不寒冷而潮湿的海风吹着我们，激起的浪花像细雨似地纷纷扑上我们的脸，翻飞的海鸟侧着翅膀从我们的身边掠过，海边上的人们向着我们挥手欢呼……阳光把黑海的水照蓝了，引着我们驶向更远的地方。从书本上得到的有关黑海的常识已经不那么使人信服了，黑海原来是那么一个宽坦的，柔和的，母亲般使人爱恋的海呵！掬一把黑海水在手掌里，它也是那么清澈透明的水呵！
    终于，我们又回到新索契疗养院山脚下的海滩上。我抬头观望，雪白的疗养院像仙宫一样镶在碧蓝的天空中；低下头来，被海水不断地冲洗着的石子，露出五颜十色绚丽的光采。我的眼睛应接不暇，我的两手忙不过来，很快地就装满了两衣袋。顶着一抹雪白泡沫的海水，嬉戏般地冲到我的脚下，正待向后躲闪它又迅急地退回去。如果是夏天，而我也是一个能戏水的少年，我将毫不迟疑地投在黑海的怀抱中，尽情地畅泳一番。可是如今，总还是冬天，只有无遮拦的大太阳照得我微微有一些困倦。我就向上走了几步，仰卧在被阳光晒得有些燠热的海滩上。我用两手遮住我的眼睛，可是从指缝中我偷觑着白云飘浮的蓝天。像遥远的儿时似地，幻想着那是一匹飞奔的马或是一座峥嵘的高山。一切是那么和谐，一切是那么美好，我不知不觉，朦朦胧胧踏近梦境的边缘了。
    一只温柔的手轻轻地拍着我的肩头，使我醒过来了，我蓦地坐起身来，一张慈祥的老妇人的脸微笑地望着我：
    “同志，不要睡在这里，到底现在还是冬天，怕受了风寒！”
    我向她说着感谢的话，正待站起来，她却在我的身旁坐下来，和我亲切地握手。她告诉我，她也是住在这个疗养院，她已经听说有中国兄弟来了，在饭厅里，她还远远地望见过我们。她告诉我，她的名字是：吉拉尼娜·玛丽亚·哥利格黎也维娜。她出生的年代是十九世纪末年，她笑着说：“我是活过两个世纪的人了！”
    “那你还在工作么？”
    “不，我已经退休了，今年我六十二岁，我做了十二年工，为党和苏维埃工作了二十六年。”
    “那么，你是因为身体不好，需要疗养才到这里来的。”
    “也不，尽管已经退休，我们也像工人一样每年都到疗养地。我已经去过不少地方，今年组织要我到索契来，因为这里天气暖和，老年人应该在温暖的地方过冬。”
    她告诉我，她在1894年生在离莫斯科二百五十公里的古斯罗斯坦利，这个地名的意思是“水晶鹅”，因为是以制造水晶手工艺品得名；可是他的家很穷，她的父亲是杂工，母亲是纺织工人，她们四姊妹都是纺织工人，她从十二岁就做纺织女工，在1914年，她在玛洛佐夫纺织厂第一次参加罢工，她说：“革命前我们许多人都走了同样的道路：没有饭吃，就争取活下去的权利。从经济斗争走上政治斗争的道路。”
    她在1917年4月入党，在二月革命和十月革命之间搞妇女工作，有许多同志到她那里去，她就陪同到各地去宣传。在十月革命以前，她就被推选为区苏维埃工农兵代表大会代表，在十月革命的时候，她参加了工人武装队，拿起武器来和敌人斗争。
    我计算着时日，她是将近四十年的老党员了，我再一次紧紧地握她的手，作为一个中国小兄弟向一个老布尔什维克致敬。她笑着说：
      “我算不得什么，我为党的工作还不够多，像我这样的人在这个疗养院里就有好几个。”她停了停，“可是我参加过第七次党代表大会，列宁同志和我谈过话，这一点是我一生最荣幸的事。”
    她说到这里的时候，她的脸上闪过一瞥幸福、青春的光辉，把岁月拖转了将近四十年。她说她不是正式代表，她只是列席参加，那次大会的主要内容是讨论布列斯特和约问题。她是由早已相识的柯伦泰同志介绍和列宁同志见面，说她是一个纺织工人。她还清楚地记得列宁同志和她握手，拍拍她的肩膀，说：“这很好，许多工人都反对剥削者，反对敌人，我们有这力量，什么都不怕了！”那时布哈林和托洛茨基正在反对列宁同志，她还记得列宁同志乐观地和她说：“如果有困难，就用膀子顶开它！”
    她说，列宁同志说过这句话，肩膀向上一动的样子一直生动而鲜明地刻在她的心中。她在工作中，任何时候遇到困难她都清晰地想起列宁同志告诉她的话和那无畏的姿势，这给了她很大的勇气和力量，使得她从来不在困难的面前低头。“就是这样一下把困难顶开了！”她模仿列宁同志的样子，可是接着她自己就笑了：“我学的一点也不像，到底他是伟大的列宁，我不过是一个普通女工。”
      她还告诉我，不仅那时在彼得堡见过他，在全苏的妇女大会上也见过他。事实上，她说，雄鹰般列宁的形象，每天都闪在她的面前，一直到今天也是这样。她说过去从列宁同志那里得到勇气，为了和国内外敌人斗争；今天，却是为了建设共产主义。
    从她的谈话中，我知道她在1919年自愿到前线打邓尼金；在卫国战争中，她也投身到部队中，当文化委员。
    “只要是敌人当前，我就要站到红军中，和敌人面对面斗争！”
    她说她今天很幸福了，儿子和女儿有的当工程师，有的当医生，有的还是苏沃洛夫军校的学生。可是她并不靠他们生活，党和政府每月给她养老金，让她过着舒服的日子。她再三问到中国的老年人，妇女和孩子们。她很关心中国工人，尤其是纺织女工。我尽我所知道的告诉她了，她很高兴，她再三要我向中国姊妹们问好，祝贺她们在祖国建设中和男子担起同样的责任，祝贺她们发扬妇女特有的坚韧刻苦的精神。
    最后，我们站起来了，她从衣袋中掏出一个很大的卵石，问了我女儿的名字，她用红铅笔写着：“一个苏联老妈妈送给中国女儿南南的纪念品。”
    我接过来，它是那么重又那么大，正像苏联人民对中国人民的感情。
