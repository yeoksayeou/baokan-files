Xinhua News Agency, April 17th, Paris Dispatch: French railway workers, numbering 365,000, began a strike at midnight on the 16th, and national rail transportation has already come to a standstill. The striking workers are demanding an 11% wage increase. After wage increase negotiations between worker representatives and the French National Railway Authority reached a deadlock, the General Confederation of Labor, the General Confederation of Labor-Workers' Force, and the French Confederation of Christian Workers jointly called on railway workers to strike for forty-eight hours. French inland waterway transport workers also participated in the strike.

The Paris subway and bus workers, sanitation workers, and other municipal workers have all decided to join the national general strike of railway workers.

This general strike will be the largest-scale strike in France since August 1953. It will deliver the heaviest blow to the current French government.

Workers in the French national gas and electricity factories, ground staff of Air France, and workers in steel and automobile factories are also demanding wage increases and may join the general strike.

Xinhua News Agency, April 17th, TASS Rome, April 16th: According to a report in "Unità," a large number of unemployed people from the towns of San Bartolomeo and Montefalcone (both in the province of Benevento) began a "hunger march" on Rome on April 14th, demanding that the government immediately take measures to solve the poverty and unemployment problems in these two towns.

The unemployed masses had only advanced a few kilometers when the police tried every possible means to stop them. As a result of clashes with the police, four unemployed people were injured and many were beaten. Despite this, the unemployed masses continued for fifty kilometers (the entire journey to the Italian capital is three hundred kilometers). However, on the 15th, a large number of police arrived, surrounded them, and forcibly dragged them onto trucks and transported them back to their place of origin.
