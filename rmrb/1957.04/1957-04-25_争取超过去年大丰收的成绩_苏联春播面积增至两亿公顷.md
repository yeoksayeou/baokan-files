Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 24th: This spring, the total sown area for various crops in the Soviet Union will increase from approximately 195 million hectares last year to 200 million hectares. This increase significantly exceeds the total sown area of wheat and barley in France in 1956.

Currently, the sowing of various crops is progressing at a faster pace than last year in the southern regions. Tens of millions of hectares of wheat, sugar beets, sunflowers, and cotton have already been sown in Ukraine, Moldavia, Kazakhstan, the southern part of the Russian Federation, and Central Asia. Grain sowing has been completed in some regions of the Kazakh Republic and parts of the North Caucasus. Many collective farms and state farms are sowing at twice the speed of last year. As of April 20th, the Azerbaijan Republic had sown twice as much cotton as in the same period last year; almost all cotton was sown using the advanced square cluster planting method.

Around the start of the spring field work season, Soviet industry manufactured and supplied approximately 200,000 agricultural machines and tools to various regions. Among them, 40,000 machines were newly manufactured, modern types.

Agricultural workers throughout the country are determined to utilize further improved material and technical conditions to strive for an even larger harvest of agricultural products this year than the unprecedented bumper harvest of the summer of 1956. The Kazakh Republic, the Soviet Union's second largest granary, plans to harvest 1.5 billion poods (one pood equals 32.76 jin) of grain this year. The Ukrainian Republic, the third largest granary, plans to increase its total grain output by 27% compared to last year. In the Lithuanian Republic, collective farms have decided to harvest half more grain and 22% more flax than last year. In addition, the Soviet Union also plans to increase the production of crops such as sugar beets, cotton, sunflowers, vegetables, and potatoes. Collective farms alone will harvest more than 350 million quintals of sugar beets, which is more than 50% higher than the total national sugar beet output in 1952.

    争取超过去年大丰收的成绩
    苏联春播面积增至两亿公顷
    新华社莫斯科24日电　到今年春季，苏联的各种农作物总播种面积将从去年的约一亿九千五百万公顷增加到两亿公顷；增加额大大超过1956年法国的小麦和大麦播种面积的总和。
    目前，各种农作物的播种工作正以比去年快的速度在南部地区进行。乌克兰、摩尔达维亚、哈萨克、俄罗斯联邦南部和中亚细亚各地已经播种了几千万公顷小麦、甜菜、向日葵和棉花。哈萨克共和国的一些州和南北高加索的一些地方的谷物播种工作已经结束。许多集体农庄和国营农场的播种速度比去年快一倍。阿塞拜疆共和国到4月20日为止播种的棉花比去年同期多一倍；几乎所有棉花都是用先进的正方穴播法播种的。
    在春季田间工作开始前后，苏联工业为各地制造和供应了约二十万部农业机器和农具。其中有四万部机器是头一次制造的新式机器。
    全国农业劳动者决定利用进一步改进了的物质技术条件，争取在今年收获比空前丰收的1956年夏还要多的农产品。苏联第二大谷仓哈萨克共和国计划在今年收获十五亿普特（每普特合三二点七六市斤）谷物，第三大谷仓乌克兰的谷物总产量计划将比去年增加27％。在立陶宛共和国，集体农庄决定要收获比去年多一半的谷物和22％的亚麻。此外，苏联的甜菜、棉花、向日葵、蔬菜、马铃薯等作物也计划要增产，单是全国集体农庄就将收获三亿五千万公担以上的甜菜，这将比1952年全国甜菜总产量多50％以上。
