    Name and Reality

    "What's in a name? That which we call a rose
    By any other word would smell as sweet."
    -- Shakespeare: "Romeo and Juliet"

    Change the name of the Colonial Office! This was a suggestion made by British Lord Barnby on April 17th. His reason was: The word "colonialism" is becoming increasingly unpopular.

    An ancient Chinese philosopher said: "The name is but a guest of the reality." Barnby disagrees with this truth. In his view, even if the reality of colonialism remains unchanged, some tricks with the name can still change the direction of people's hearts. Therefore, as long as Britain changes the sign of the Colonial Office, the cruel suppression in Malaya, the bloody massacres in Kenya, the terror rule in Cyprus... all of this will appear to be noble actions.

    Great is the effect of names!

    If Shakespeare were still alive, he would probably revise his famous lines and send them to Barnby:

    "What's in a name? That which we call colonial,
    By any other name would still suck blood and marrow?"

    名和实
    “名字又算什么？我们叫做玫瑰的，
    不叫它玫瑰闻着不也一样地香吗？”
    ——莎士比亚：“罗密欧与朱丽叶”
    把殖民地部的名字改一下吧！这是英国上院议员巴恩比在4月17日提出的一个建议。他的理由是：殖民主义这个字眼已经越来越不得人心了。
    中国古代的哲学家说过：“名者，实之宾也。”巴恩比是不同意这个真理的。在他看来，尽管殖民主义之实不变，如果在名字上出些花样，还是可以改变人心的向背。因此，只要英国把殖民地部的招牌换掉，马来亚的残酷镇压，怯尼亚的血腥屠杀，塞浦路斯的恐怖统治……，这一切就会显得是高尚的行动了。
    大矣哉！名字的作用。
    如果莎士比亚还活着，他大概会要把自己著名的诗句改动一下送给巴恩比：
    “名字又算什么？我们叫做殖民的，
    不叫它殖民不也一样饮血吮髓吗？”　（禄）（附图片）
