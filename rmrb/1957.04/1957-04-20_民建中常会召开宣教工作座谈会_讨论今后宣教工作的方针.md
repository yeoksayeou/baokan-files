    The Central Standing Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association convened a propaganda work symposium.
    Discussing Future Propaganda Work Guidelines
    (Our Newspaper) The Central Standing Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, in order to summarize the experiences of propaganda and education work of local organizations after the joint state-private ownership of all industries and to discuss the future direction and specific content of propaganda and education work, specially convened from the 5th to the 17th of this month a propaganda work symposium. Responsible comrades from the working committees of Sichuan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Hebei, and Shandong provinces, as well as the municipal committees of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Chongqing, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Guangzhou, Shenyang, and Jinan, along with some industrialist and businessman members, attended.
    Based on the spirit of Chairman Mao's speeches at the Supreme State Conference and the CCP Central Committee's Propaganda Work Conference, the meeting comprehensively and specifically analyzed the current basic situation of industrialists and businessmen in our country. The meeting believes that the main basis for propaganda work is the ideological trends of the industrial and commercial circles. In the future, a system must be established to regularly understand and analyze them, distinguishing between the mainstream, small streams, and undercurrents, and grasp their changes and trends. The meeting determined that the focus of future propaganda content should be on: (1) strengthening patriotic and socialist education; (2) continuing to implement the education of the Second Plenary Session of the China Democratic National Construction Association on the current resolutions on several main principles; (3) encouraging and assisting members to attach importance to political theory study; (4) vigorously publicizing and studying the principle of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision"; (5) strengthening the education of the association's charter.
    The meeting discussed and approved three documents—Opinions on Future Propaganda Work, Preliminary Experiences and Opinions on Assisting the State in Implementing the Policy of Taking Enterprises as the Main Base for Uniting, Educating, and Transforming Private Personnel, and Experiences and Opinions on Promoting Industrialist and Businessmen Members to Conduct Theoretical Current Affairs Policy Studies.
