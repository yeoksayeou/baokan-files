Reading "The Early Spring Weather for Intellectuals"
——Exchanging Some Ideas with Mr. Fei Xiaotong
Ni Hesheng, Committee Member of the Nanjing Branch of the Jiusan Society

"The Early Spring Weather for Intellectuals" reflects the feelings of some older intellectuals.

Even though it is already the season of "Jiangnan grass growing and orioles flying," after reading Mr. Fei Xiaotong's "The Early Spring Weather for Intellectuals" (People's Daily, March 24, 1957), one cannot help but feel a slight chill. Mr. Fei's article is very subtle and indeed reflects the feelings of some older intellectuals. Some of the unspoken meanings in the article seem like a cold wind blowing from the wilderness. At first hearing, it gives one a feeling of "unseasonable cold." However, looking around at the surrounding scenery, one feels that this wind is a bit out of sync with the true realm of "the ruthless water flows, yet the grass springs forth on its own." Therefore, based on my humble opinion, I would like to raise some points for Mr. Fei's consideration.

Mr. Fei represents some senior experts who want "a room, two books, and quiet time to do their homework." Undoubtedly, this is reasonable. Some senior experts hope to "have the opportunity to attend academic conferences, even to take a break from production for further study, and to study abroad." These wishes are also good. The facts are before our eyes. In the past two years, China's academic circles have obviously become increasingly active, and more and more people's wishes will gradually be fulfilled in the future.

What I don't quite understand is Mr. Fei's statement that last year's "anti-dogmatism resulted in new demands on teachers...causing teachers to feel stressed in their work." So much so that some teachers feel that "teaching is not easy."

The question is raised, should anti-dogmatism continue? I believe that the reason why some teachers feel that books are difficult to teach is precisely because they have long been constrained by various forms of dogmatism. In particular, those who were once obsessed with "complete Westernization," blindly copying from the United States and Britain in the past, have now been hit by a surge of new ideas, with a momentum like an overwhelming force. Those accustomed to swimming in a still pond will naturally feel both surprised and delighted. Marxism-Leninism and the advanced experience of the Soviet Union are all new and unfamiliar to us. If we adopt an attitude of "I'll learn if you want me to," or use old methods to learn these new things, we will inevitably run aground everywhere. Seeing the advancing队伍"sailing swiftly past myriad mountains," how can one not feel a sense of tension in their heart? The lament of "being annoyed by affection" is of no help. To avoid work-related stress, perhaps we should first liberate ourselves from dogmatism.

Combine the bookshelf with the larger society.

Based on my contact with many university professors, their professional competence has improved greatly since liberation. Those who have abilities but nowhere to use them are, after all, a minority within the minority. A friend who works in power engineering told me, "What I've learned in the past few years is far more than what I learned in the past few decades." He said:

“At each stage of teaching reform, I always opposed it at the beginning. My thinking gradually cleared up. Looking back now, if there had been no teaching reform, my professional competence would still be stuck at the pre-liberation level. Without the leadership of the Party, how could I be where I am today?” There are many such friends. Their direction is relatively clear. They often go to factories and often "don't go to bed until after midnight," but they feel at peace in their hearts and have no sense of emptiness.

Last year, under the personal leadership of the president and vice-president, an agricultural college organized several teaching and research groups to form a "Technical Liaison Group for Agricultural Production Cooperatives" to specifically help seven cooperatives solve technical problems in production. They learned many good things from the peasants, enriched the content of scientific research, and improved the quality of teaching. At the same time, the peasants were also very grateful to them. Recently, one cooperative wrote a letter to them, saying:

Dear Comrades of ×× Agricultural College:

As we gather two hundred and seventy-five advanced producers and twenty-one advanced production units to celebrate the first anniversary of the establishment of our cooperative, we, on behalf of all members, extend our heartfelt gratitude to you.

Thank you for your strong support in science and technology over the past year. For example, you specifically helped us cultivate sweet potato seedlings, enabling us to have a bumper harvest of sweet potatoes. Last year, the sweet potato seedlings we cultivated ourselves yielded an average of 1,500 jin per mu, and the highest yield was 2,000 jin per mu; sweet potato seedlings bought from other places yielded only 600-700 jin per mu; the output difference was more than doubled. Of course, thanks to your strong support, the achievements we have made in production are hard to describe in words. All of us producers unanimously believe that "in order to realize the forty articles of the National Agricultural Development Program," we must continue to learn from you with an open mind in the future. Finally,

We wish you good health!

            All Advanced Producers of the
          October Agricultural Production
            Cooperative, Qixia District,
            Nanjing City.

The enlightenment and education that peasants give to intellectuals is also indescribable. Now the professors at this agricultural college are even more enthusiastic. On February 28th, under the leadership of the Party and government, they held a work conference to support agricultural collectivization, deciding to establish a "Comprehensive Work Group" to provide overall technical guidance to a key cooperative in addition to providing support for key projects to various agricultural cooperatives.

Is the path for old intellectuals engaged in social sciences to go into practice smooth? I think it may be more tortuous, but as long as they put in real effort, they will always reap rewards. In fact, Mr. Fei mentioned Mr. Li Jinghan in his article, who is a good example. Mr. Li must have deeply experienced the joys and sorrows of doing scholarship.

There are also some opposite examples. There is an old intellectual engaged in politics and law who taught for many years and wrote a thick "University Series." In theory, he has some "capital." After liberation, this friend was determined to write a new book on administration. He drafted the outline several times and humbly sought opinions from others everywhere. Everyone advised him not to just look for materials in the People's Daily and magazines, but to first go to land reform, to residents' committees, to grassroots election work, to experience life and clarify the basic viewpoints of writing the book before starting to write. However, it was difficult for this friend to leave his quiet study. As far as I know, his outline had not been turned into a manuscript before he died last year.

This issue seems to involve whether there is a contradiction between academics and politics. A few days ago, the Academic Committee of the Institute of Paleontology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences was established in Nanjing. The Jiusan Society and the China Democratic League held a tea party on the spot to entertain some of the comrades and friends who attended the meeting. At this meeting, paleontologists from Beijing were satisfied with the peaceful working environment in Nanjing. At the same time, they also had opinions, believing that "this environment is too quiet, a bit like an ancient temple." They hope that paleontologists in Nanjing and Beijing will learn from each other. That is, don't be too stressed or too quiet. Now many old intellectuals have put the Twenty-Four Histories and Zizhi Tongjian on their shelves, which is a good phenomenon. I think, if we combine the bookshelf with the larger society, will it be more meaningful in reality?

Advancing towards science mainly depends on everyone showing their talents.

Is the fact that scientific research in higher education institutions has not been well developed simply due to insufficient specific leadership? In my humble opinion, it cannot be generalized. The role of leadership is important in any work, but it is only one aspect of the problem. Advancing towards science is, after all, different from military advancement. In military advancement, as long as the order is given and the three armies follow orders, it is not difficult to charge into battle. Scientific advancement is more complicated. Everyone's specific conditions are different, and their interests vary. Leadership can only provide the necessary material and organizational conditions, point out the general direction, principles, and spiritual support. As for which peak to climb? How to climb? And how to gradually improve the quality of teaching in the process of climbing? It mainly depends on everyone showing their talents. In the same university under the same leadership, Department A may be doing well, while Department B may not be doing so well. A chairman of the Department of Mechanical Engineering told me that in his department, one teaching and research group is working enthusiastically, while another teaching and research group is silent. This chairman has considerable talent and attaches great importance to research work, thinking of many ways to promote research and improve teaching. Why has the scientific research work of another teaching and research group not been well developed? It is understood that a major old professor in the teaching and research group hopes to catch up with the world's advanced level all at once, and at the same time feels that his theoretical foundation is not enough and needs to be supplemented. So he started supplementing from high school mathematics, and he has already done more than 1,800 exercises. It's not that he doesn't know how to do the exercises, but he wants to be proficient, proficient, and more proficient, so that he can see the results in two years. Everyone feels that his ideas and practices are problematic and is very worried about him, but they can't persuade him, so they have to let him go for the time being, but the entire department and teaching and research group will be affected.

By giving such examples, I have absolutely no intention of saying that university professors should not emphasize scientific research. If university professors do not engage in research, not only can they not create inventions and make more and better contributions to socialism, but it is also difficult to improve their own ability to think independently, and it is difficult to make teaching popular. However, if professors engage in research away from teaching, the teaching administrators—the housekeepers—will be in trouble. Students are a group of infants waiting to be fed, and milk must be fed by someone. The problem is very real. It is rude and wrong to "shout that there is a contradiction between teaching and research, and that teachers are fame-seeking and value research over teaching" when encountering such problems. But as a teacher, if one really "values research over teaching," I think this issue is still worth studying.

Regarding some ideological situations in the "Hundred Schools of Thought," I basically agree with Mr. Fei's analysis. But there is another point worth mentioning, that is, in our country, there is a lack of historical tradition and habit of contention. The contention in the Spring and Autumn period was only a flash in the pan. After the Qin and Han dynasties until the Qing dynasty, the fate of men of letters and scholars was ill-fated, which is well known. There was also a period of contention in the May Fourth era, but it was followed by warlord melee and reactionary rule. In Lu Xun's works, you can see that many young people pursuing the truth were beheaded and displayed to the public. Some intellectuals over middle age today, of course, still remember this clearly. This historical trend and lifestyle of thousands of years cannot be completely reversed in three or five years. Moreover, we are still very unfamiliar with the specific application of Marxism-Leninism, and contention is indeed not easy! Therefore, we should not be too hasty in implementing the policy of contention. If there is no good contention now (in fact, contention has already begun), there is no need to blame the heavens or the earth. I think it is more important to actively eliminate concerns, cultivate habits, create conditions, and step up learning. When the water comes, the channel will naturally be formed.

The atmosphere of old intellectuals discussing national affairs has only just begun in recent years, and habits need to be further cultivated.

As for issues that are more closely related to practical politics, old intellectuals generally take a prudent attitude, the reasons for which are similar to those of the "Hundred Schools of Thought." In old China, "Do not talk about state affairs" was often posted on the walls of teahouses and hotels. During this period, bourgeois democracy in Britain had become quite presentable. The fierce debates and recriminations in the British Parliament meetings aroused the admiration of Chinese students studying in Britain (Mr. Fei wrote an article in "New Observer" last summer commenting on this). China lacks such a stage. The atmosphere of old intellectuals discussing national affairs in public has only just begun in recent years, and habits need to be further cultivated. As for whether old intellectuals do not care about world and national affairs? I think Mr. Fei's estimate in the article is too low. When the Hungarian incident occurred last year, senior intellectuals generally responded sensitively. Confused thoughts were not completely absent, but most people mainly had two feelings: one was surprise, why did this problem occur in a socialist country? What were the Hungarian police doing at ordinary times? The second was self-congratulation, fortunately the Soviet army helped, and the riots were quickly quelled; further they appreciated the smooth leadership of the Chinese Party. In recent years, our domestic storm-like reform movement and heavy construction work, plus the war to resist US aggression and aid Korea, were fortunate not to have caused any chaos. I don't know much about the situation of young people, but I estimate that old intellectuals are much more calm and prudent than some young people.

Can this reaction be said that old intellectuals "have not deeply thought about it, the ancient well has not rippled, and are not very concerned"? I don't think such a conclusion can be drawn. Old intellectuals have more experience, not only know today, but also know yesterday more clearly; they remember yesterday's ghostly shadows, and understand the difficulty of creating the revolutionary cause and the hard-won peace life of today. Although the "one room, two books" petty-bourgeois situation is not completely satisfactory, it is worlds apart from the "eight years of separation and chaos."

Of course, as Mr. Fei said, the enthusiasm of some old intellectuals still needs to be further improved, "Then how can we bring out their enthusiasm in this area?" In my humble opinion, strengthening specific leadership and strengthening ideological and political work are one aspect; the active leadership, publicity and implementation of policies by old intellectuals, especially representative figures, is also one aspect. The close combination of the two will quickly bring out their enthusiasm.

Can we say that it is now the season of spring warmth and flowers blooming? I think the red apricot has already climbed over the wall.

    读“知识分子的早春天气”
    ——同费孝通先生交换几点意见
    九三学社南京分社委员　倪鹤笙
    “知识分子的早春天气”反映了一部分老知识分子的心情。
    尽管已是“江南草长、群莺乱飞”的时节了，但读了费孝通先生“知识分子的早春天气”，（人民日报1957年3月24日）仍不禁有丝丝凉意。费先生文章写得很含蓄，确乎反映了一部分老知识分子的心情。文中某些弦外之音，好像漠野上吹来了一股冷风，乍听之下，颇使人有“倒春寒”的感觉。然而，放眼看看周围景色，又觉得这股风和“流水无情草自春”的真实境界有点不调协，因就鄙见所及，提出来向费先生请教。
    费先生代表某些老专家要“一间房、二本书、静静地做做功课”，毫无疑问，是合理的。有些老专家希望“有机会出席学术性的会议，甚至要脱离生产进修一个时期，和出国留学等”。这些愿望也是好的。事实摆在眼前，近两年来我国的学术界显然是日益活跃了，今后自会逐渐有更多人的愿望得到满足。
    使我不大理解的，是费先生谈到去年“反教条主义的结果，对教师提出了新的要求。……引起教师们业务上的紧张”。以致有些教师感到“教书这个行道是不容易搞了”。
    问题提出来了，教条主义应不应该继续反下去？我以为，某些教师之所以感到书难教，正由于长期受到各种各样教条主义束缚的结果。特别是过去醉心于“全盘西化”的人，从前盲目抄袭英美，解放后，新思潮汹涌澎湃，大有排山倒海而来之势，习惯于在静水的小池里游泳的人，自会感到又惊又喜。马克思列宁主义和苏联的先进经验，对我们来说，都是全新的、陌生的东西。如果我们抱着“你要我学我就学吧”的态度，或是拿过去的老法子来学习这类新东西，就难免处处搁浅；抬头看到前进的队伍“轻舟已过万重山”了，内心怎能不油然紧张起来？“多情却被无情恼”的感叹，是无补于事的。要免除业务上的紧张，恐怕还是先从教条主义中解放出来。
    把书架子和大社会结合在一起。
    就我所接触到的很多大学教授，解放以来，业务情况已有很大的提高。有力无处使的，毕竟是少数中的少数。有位搞动力的朋友告诉我：“这几年我学的东西，比过去几十年学的要多的多。”他说：
  “在教学改革的每个阶段，一开头我总是反对的，思想是逐步搞通的，现在回头看看，如果没有教学改革，我的业务仍旧停留在解放前的水平，如果没有党的领导，那能有我今天？”这类朋友很多，他们的方向比较明确，经常下工厂，也常常“不到午夜不上床”，但内心安定，没有什么空虚之感。
    有个农学院，去年在正副院长亲自领导下，好几个教研组联合组织了一个“农业生产合作社技术联系小组”，具体帮助七个合作社解决生产上的技术问题。他们从农民那里学来了不少好东西，丰富了科学研究的内容，提高了教学质量；同时，农民对他们也很感激。最近有一个合作社写了封信给他们，信上说：
    亲爱的××农学院全体同志：
    当我们齐集了二百七十五个先进生产者和二十一个先进生产单位庆祝建社一周年的今天，我们代表全体社员向您们致以衷心的感谢。
    感谢您们一年来在科学技术上给予我们的大力支援。例如，你们具体帮助我们培育山芋苗，使我们的山芋能够得到丰收。去年自己培育的山芋苗，一般的每亩收到一千五百斤，最高的收到二千斤；从外地买来的山芋苗，每亩只收到六百——七百斤；产量相差一倍以上。当然由于您们大力支援，使我们在生产上所获的成就，是难以用笔墨形容的。我们全体生产者一致认为“为了实现农业发展纲要四十条”，今后还要虚心向您们学习。最后，
    敬祝
    身体健康！
            南京市栖霞区十月农业
          生产合作社全体先进生
            产者敬上。
    农民给予知识分子的启发与教育也是笔墨难形容的。现在这个农学院的教授们劲头更大了，2月28日，他们在党政领导下，召开了支援农业合作化工作会议，决定成立“综合工作组”，对各个农业合作社除了进行重点项目支援外，另选一个重点社，进行全面的技术指导。
    搞社会科学的老知识分子走向实际的道路是否畅行无阻？我想，可能要多一些曲折，只要下真功夫，总会有收获。事实上，费先生文章提到的李景汉先生就是很好的例子。做学问的甘苦，李先生一定体会得很深刻。
    也有些相反的例子。有位搞政法的老知识分子，过去教书有年，写过一本厚厚的“大学丛书”。按说，他是有些“本钱”的。解放后，这位朋友立志要写本新的行政学，提纲拟了好几遍，很虚心地到处找人提意见。大家劝他不要光在人民日报和杂志上找材料，最好先到土地改革中去，到居民委员会中去，到基层普选工作中去，体验体验生活，把写书的基本观点搞清楚再动笔。可是，要这位朋友走出自己静静的书房是比较困难的。据我所知，直到他去年病故之前，他的提纲并未变成手稿。
    这问题似乎已涉及学术和政治有无矛盾了。前几天，中国科学院古生物研究所学术委员会在南京成立。九三学社和民盟就地举行了一次茶会，招待一部分到会的同志和朋友。这次会上，从北京来的古生物学家对南京安宁的工作环境，是感到满意的，同时，他们也有意见，认为“这个环境太静了，静得有点像古庙”。他们希望南京和北京的古生物界朋友要互相学习。就是说，既不要太紧张，也不要太安静。现在很多老知识分子把二十四史、资治通鉴搬上了书架，这是好现象。我想，如果把书架子和大社会结合在一起，是否更有现实意义呢？
    向科学进军，主要靠各显身手。
    目前高等学校科学研究没有很好开展，是否仅仅由于具体领导不够？个人粗浅看法，不能一概而论。领导的作用在任何工作中都具有重要意义，但它究竟只是问题的一面。向科学进军，毕竟不同于军事上的进军。军事上的进军，只要号令一出、三军用命，就不难冲锋陷阵的。科学进军可就复杂了，各个人的具体条件不同，爱好各异，领导工作只可能提供必要的物质条件和组织条件，指出总的方向、原则和精神上的支援；至于攀登哪一个山峰？如何攀登？又如何在攀登中把教学质量逐步提高？主要靠各显身手。在同一个领导的大学里，甲系搞得很好，乙系可能搞得不太好。有一位搞机械制造的系主任告诉我，在他的系里，一个教研组搞得热火朝天，另一个教研组却无声无息。这位系主任有相当才干，很重视研究工作，想了很多推动研究、提高教学的办法。为什么另一个教研组科学研究工作没有很好开展呢？据了解，教研组里一位主要的老教授希望一下子赶上世界先进水平，同时又感到自己理论基础不够，需要补课，于是从高中数学补起，他已埋头做了一千八百多个习题，习题不是完全不会做，为的是熟练、熟练、再熟练，好在两年后见分晓。大伙觉得他的想法和做法有问题，很为他操了一番心，无奈说服不了，只好暂时随他去，可是整个系和教研组都要受影响。
    举出这类例子，我绝没有丝毫意思说大学教授不应该强调科学研究。大学教授不从事研究，不仅谈不到创造发明，为社会主义作出更多更好的贡献，就连自己独立思考的能力也很难提高，教学也很难叫座。但是，如果教授脱离教学而研究，教学行政人员——这个管家婆子就为难了。学生是一群嗷嗷待哺的婴儿，乳总得有人喂，问题是十分现实的。碰到这类问题就“大叫教学和研究有矛盾，教师名利心重，轻教重研”，那是粗暴的、错误的。但作为一个教师，如果真的“轻教重研”，我认为这问题仍然值得研究。
    关于“百家争鸣”中的某些思想情况，我基本上同意费先生的分析。但有另一点值得一提，就是在我们的国家里，争鸣是缺乏历史传统和习惯的。春秋时代的争鸣只是昙花一现，秦汉而后直到清代，文人学士命途多舛，是尽人皆知的。五四时代也曾一度争鸣，但紧跟着就是军阀混战、反动统治。鲁迅的作品里就能看到：很多追求真理的青年被悬首示众；今天中年以上的某些知识分子，对此当然记忆犹新。这个几千年来的历史趋势和生活习惯，自然不是三年五载所能完全扭转过来的。而况，我们对于马克思列宁主义的具体运用，还很生疏，争鸣也确非容易！所以，对于贯彻争鸣的方针，不宜操之过急。目前没有很好地争鸣起来（事实上已开始争鸣了），也不必怨天怨地。我看，还是积极破除顾虑、培养习惯、创造条件、加紧学习要紧。水到自然渠成。
    老知识分子纵论国家大事的风气，近几年刚开始，习惯有待于进一步培养。
    至于和实际政治关系比较密切的问题，老知识分子一般持稳健态度，其原因和百家争鸣有共同之处。在旧中国，茶馆酒店墙上常贴“莫谈国事”。就在这个时期，英国资产阶级民主已经搞得很像样子了。巴力门开会时互相抨击的激烈辩论场面，曾引起中国留英学生的爱慕（费先生去年夏天在“新观察”写文章评述过。）。在中国，缺少这么一个阶段。在大庭广众之中，老知识分子纵论国家大事的风气，近几年刚开始，习惯有待于进一步培养。至于老知识分子是不是就不关心世界和国家大事呢？我觉得，费先生在文章中估计过低。去年匈牙利事件发生时，高级知识分子的反映一般是敏锐的。混乱思想不是完全没有，多数人主要有两重心情：一是惊讶，社会主义国家为什么会发生这问题？匈牙利的公安人员平时干什么去了？二是自幸，幸而苏军帮了忙，暴乱很快平伏了；更进一步体会到中国党领导的平稳，几年来，我们国内暴风雨般的改革运动和繁重的建设工作，加上抗美援朝，幸而没出什么乱子。青年人的情况我不大了解，估计老知识分子比某些青年人要沉着稳健得多。
    这种反映能不能说是老知识分子都“没有深刻地动过脑筋，古井没有生波，不很关心”呢？我看，不能下这样的结论。老知识分子阅历多了，不仅知道今天，更清楚地知道昨天；他们记得昨天的鬼影幢幢，懂得革命事业缔造的艰难、今天的和平生活来之不易。尽管“一间房、二本书”的小康局面未尽如意，但比之“八年离乱”却有天壤之别。
    当然，诚如费先生所说，某些老知识分子的积极性还有待于进一步提高，“那么怎样能把他们在这方面的积极性发挥出来呢？”依照个人粗浅的看法，加强具体领导，加强思想政治工作，是一方面；老知识分子，特别是代表性人物的积极带头，宣传和贯彻政策，也是一方面。两者的密切结合，积极性就会很快地发挥出来。
    能不能说，现在已是春暖花开的时节了呢？我看，红杏已出墙头了。
