Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, April 16th (Reporters Lu Munong and Xu Jiazhu): The Snake Island expedition team, consisting of twelve members, and its accompanying personnel, safely returned to Lüda City on the evening of the 15th. The two-day investigation of Snake Island has been filmed by news photographers.

Snake Island is a place with many venomous snakes, but it is not the exceptionally terrifying world that people used to believe. This is the impression gained after a preliminary investigation of Snake Island.

During the two-day preliminary investigation, the Snake Island expedition team, led by Professor Wu Lü of Dalian Medical College, discovered twenty highly venomous vipers without specifically searching for them. Nine of those captured have been brought back to Lüda.

The daytime climate on Snake Island is between five and nine degrees Celsius. Vipers emerge in large numbers in such weather, indicating that there are quite a few vipers on the island. The lower body of this viper often curves into a spring shape, with a triangular head held straight. It can quickly leap up and bite other animals. Its common name is "Grass Flyer," and its venom is similar to that of the five-step snake in the south. It is said that after a person is bitten by a five-step snake, they will fall to the ground after taking five steps.

Snake Island is overgrown with weeds. The vipers here, along with the multi-branched shrubs and rocks, are all earth-gray, which adds to the island's eerie atmosphere. The expedition team found many corpses and bones of eagles and other birds under the rocks on Snake Island, as well as the head of a rat that had been bitten to death about two or three days ago. Eagles and some other birds may have been bitten and poisoned by vipers before being eaten by the snakes.

The expedition members and accompanying personnel wore protective clothing, hats, and boots on Snake Island and remained vigilant at all times, so no accidents occurred. On the morning of the 15th, the animal group of the expedition team collected many interesting marine animals on the beach. The geography group of the expedition team also made a rough map of the terrain of Snake Island. Geologist Li Yongfan also investigated the geological structure of Snake Island. Soil researchers and pharmacists each brought back soil and wild herbs from Snake Island. The expedition team also determined that the highest point of the Snake Island mountain peak is 215.2 meters above sea level.

    蛇岛不是一个恐怖世界
    考察队已安全返抵旅大
    新华社旅大16日电　新华社记者鲁牧农、徐家柱报道：由十二人组成的蛇岛考察队和它的随行人员，已经在15日傍晚安全地返回旅大市。他们在蛇岛为期两天的考察情况，已经被新闻摄影师拍成了电影。
    蛇岛是一个毒蛇众多的地方，但并不像过去人们所传说的那样是一个异常恐怖的世界。这就是人们对蛇岛进行初步考察后所得到的印象。
    由大连医学院教授伍律率领的蛇岛考察队，在两天的初步考察中，没有专门搜索，就发现了二十条毒性非常强的蝮蛇。其中被捕捉到的九条，已经带回了旅大。
    蛇岛白天的气候在摄氏五度到九度，蝮蛇在这样的天气里就大量出洞活动，说明岛上蝮蛇的数量不少。这种蝮蛇下体常常弯曲成弹簧状，三角形的蛇头挺直，一下子就能很快地跃起，咬伤其他动物。它的俗名叫“草上飞”，毒性同南方的五步蛇差不多。据说，人被五步蛇咬伤后，走了五步就会倒地。
    蛇岛野草丛生，这里的蝮蛇和那些多桠枝的灌木、岩石都是土灰色的，从而也给岛上带来一些恐怖的气氛。考察队在蛇岛上的岩石下找到了不少鹰和其他鸟类的尸体、骨头，还有大约两三天前被咬死的鼠的脑袋。鹰和其他一些鸟类可能是被蝮蛇咬伤中毒后，被蛇吃掉的。
    考察队员和随行人员在蛇岛上穿戴了保护性的衣服。帽子和靴子，并且时刻警惕着，因此没有发生任何意外。考察队动物组在15日清晨，到海滩上采集了许多有趣的海滨动物。考察队地理组还草测了蛇岛的地形图。地质教育工作者李永蕃也考察了蛇岛的地质构造。土壤研究者和药剂师都分别从蛇岛带回了土壤和野生药草。考察队还测定，蛇岛山峰最高点为拔海二一五·二公尺。
