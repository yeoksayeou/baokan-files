Moscow, April 6th (By Our Correspondent) - An unprecedented wave of nationwide discussion is unfolding across the Soviet Union. The topic is the shift of the economic management focus from the central government to local areas. Local Party organizations, enterprise and construction site employees, and the Communist Youth League organizations are actively participating in the discussion. People have enthusiastically offered many constructive suggestions for improving economic management while discussing Khrushchev's report outline. According to press reports, these opinions will be collected and submitted to the Soviet Supreme Soviet meeting to be convened on May 7 for final decision.

From the large amount of materials published in the newspapers, it appears that the Soviet people unanimously support the principles put forward by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and are now carefully considering the most perfect specific measures. People's attention is focused on the new form of economic management proposed in Khrushchev's report outline, which is to establish National Economic Councils in the more industrially developed states, territories, and autonomous republics to replace the existing central ministries and bureaus.

The Plenary Session of the Moscow City Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has been discussing the issue of improving economic management for days. The First Secretary of the City Committee, Yekaterina Furtseva, reported on the new plan for industrial and construction management in Moscow. From this, we can see the specific content of the National Economic Council of the economic administrative region that will be implemented in the Soviet Union. Moscow is the industrial, transportation, scientific, and cultural center of the Soviet Union. There are currently 1,507 industrial enterprises in Moscow (excluding nearly 300 enterprises without independent accounting). The city's industrial workers number 1,055,000, including 100,700 engineers and technicians. More than 230,000 people work on Moscow construction sites, and 45,000 people work in building materials factories. Nearly 100,000 people work at Moscow railway stations. There are 330 scientific research and design institutions in Moscow, with more than 130,000 scientific, engineering and technical personnel working there. The city's universities train more than 40,000 people in 250 specialties each year. Furtseva said: The management plan for industry and construction in Moscow was formulated based on this situation. In formulating the plan, the city committee consulted with the broad masses and absorbed opinions from all sides. After the plan is approved by the plenary session of the city committee, it will be submitted to factories, scientific research institutions and newspapers for discussion. The plan stipulates that the Moscow City National Economic Council will be established. However, due to the large scale of industry and construction in Moscow, the departments directly related to the needs of workers will be assigned to the Moscow City Soviet Executive Committee for management. This includes 936 enterprises with 440,500 employees, including the Construction Bureau, the Building Materials Bureau, the Bus Bureau, the Local Industry Bureau, the Livelihood Services Bureau, the Bread Trust, and so on. The vast majority of enterprises currently managed by the Union, the Union Republics, and the Republic's ministries and bureaus will be transferred to the Moscow City National Economic Council for management. Considering the important position of Moscow's industry in the country, it is proposed that the Moscow City National Economic Council be directly under the leadership of the Soviet Council of Ministers. Sixteen administrative bureaus and four trusts will be established in the Moscow City National Economic Council. They will lead 559 enterprises and 71 scientific research and design institutions. The industry it manages will have 759,000 people. The City National Economic Council itself will have approximately 1,000 staff members, and the bureaus and trusts under its jurisdiction will have 2,200 staff members. It must guarantee the completion of production plans, comprehensively develop various industries, and continuously improve labor productivity on the basis of high technology, specialization, and collaboration. Its task is to discover and utilize potential strengths and give full play to the creativity of workers to develop industrial production.

    苏联全民讨论改进经济管理工作
    莫斯科市已拟就工业和建筑管理新方案
    本报莫斯科6日电　一个空前巨大的全民讨论热潮正在苏联全国展开。这是关于把经济管理重心从中央移向地方的讨论。各个地方党的组织、各个企业和工地的职工以及共青团组织都积极参加讨论。人们在讨论赫鲁晓夫的报告提纲时踊跃提出许多改善经济管理的建设性意见。据报刊公布，这些意见将集中起来，提到5月7日召开的苏联最高苏维埃会议上去作最后决定。
    从报刊发表的大量材料看来，苏联人民一致拥护苏联共产党中央提出的原则，现在正周密地考虑最完善的具体措施。人们的注意力集中在赫鲁晓夫报告提纲中所提出的管理经济的新形式上，这就是在工业比较发达的州、边疆区、自治共和国设立国民经济委员会以代替现有的中央部、局。
    苏联共产党莫斯科市委员会全体会议连日讨论改善经济管理问题。市委第一书记福尔采娃在会上报告了莫斯科市工业和建筑管理的新方案。从这里我们可以看出在苏联将要实行的经济行政区的国民经济委员会的具体内容。莫斯科是苏联的工业、交通和科学、文化中心，在莫斯科现有一千五百零七个工业企业（不包括没有独立收支的近三百个企业）。全市工业职工有一百零五万五千人，内有十万零七千工程师和技师。在莫斯科工地上工作的有二十三万多人，在建筑材料工厂中工作的有四万五千人。在莫斯科铁路站上工作的近十万人。在莫斯科有三百三十所科学研究和设计机关，有十三万多科学和工程技术人员在那里工作。这里的高等学校每年培养出二百五十种专业的四万多人。福尔采娃说：莫斯科市工业和建筑的管理方案，就是根据这种情况制定的。在制定方案时，市委同广大人民商量过，吸收了各方面的意见。这个方案经过市委全会批准以后，还要交给各个工厂、科学研究机关和报刊讨论。方案规定将建立莫斯科市国民经济委员会。但是由于莫斯科的工业和建筑规模巨大，把其中与劳动者需要直接联系的部门分给市苏维埃执行委员会管理，这包括建筑局、建筑材料局、公共汽车局、地方工业局、生活服务局、面包托辣斯等等九百三十六个企业，四十四万零五百名职工。而把现由联盟、加盟共和国和共和国的部和局管理的绝大多数企业移交莫斯科市国民经济委员会管理。考虑到莫斯科工业在全国所占的重要地位，提出了莫斯科市国民经济委员会直接归苏联部长会议领导的意见。在莫斯科市国民经济委员会中将建立十六个管理局、四个托辣斯，它们将领导五百五十九个企业和七十一个科学研究和设计机关。它所管理的工业将有七十五万九千人。市国民经济委员会本身将有工作人员约一千人，所辖各局和托辣斯将有二千二百名工作人员。它要保证生产计划的完成，要综合地发展各门工业，要在高度技术、专业化和协作化的基础上不断提高劳动生产率。它的任务是：发掘和利用潜在力量，发挥劳动者的创造性，以发展工业生产。
