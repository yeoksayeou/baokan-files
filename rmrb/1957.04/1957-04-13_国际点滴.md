International Tidbits

　　A Painting Smaller Than Half a Grain of Rice

　　The Italian painter Piero Busonai, world-renowned for his skill in painting small pictures, recently completed a landscape and figure painting that is only half a grain of rice in size.

　　The painting is 2.5 millimeters wide and 2.8 millimeters long. When viewed with a magnifying glass, one can clearly see eight people including young singers singing hymns and churchgoers, as well as a red flag and swallows flying on the spire of the church.

　　Single-Horned Rhino Discovered in Malaysian Jungle

　　According to Singapore newspapers, the huge gray animal recently discovered in the Malaysian jungle has been identified as the rare rhinoceros, a precious animal in the world. This rhinoceros has three toes on its feet and only one horn on its head, and is known as the "Javan rhinoceros."

　　This rhinoceros was photographed once before around 1927, but has not been discovered since.

　　Old Stamps are Invaluable

　　A old stamp with a face value of one penny was bought by two British businessmen in London on March 25 at an unprecedented high price of four thousand five hundred pounds.

　　This stamp was issued in 1847 in the British island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. It is said that there are only two such stamps in the world now.

　　Swapping Wives

　　According to American newspapers: An ophthalmologist named Schwartz and a flower shop supplier named Brooks in the United States recently decided to exchange wives and are currently rushing to complete divorce and marriage procedures.

　　Last November, Omohundro and Kepus in California exchanged wives, children, and residences.

　　Interesting Contrast

　　The London "Times" reported on March 11: British Education Minister Hailsham said: "The average education cost per person per year in Britain is ten pounds, which accounts for only a quarter of the money we spend on smoking, drinking, entertaining, and gambling."

    半粒米大的一幅画
    以擅长绘小画而闻名世界的意大利画家皮爱罗·布沙乃拉，最近完成了一幅只有半粒米大的风景人物画。
    这幅画宽2.5毫米，长2.8毫米。人们用扩大镜可以清楚地看出画中有唱圣诗的少年歌手和教徒等八个人，还有一面红旗和在教堂塔尖上飞翔的燕子。
    马来亚丛林发现独角犀
    据新加坡报纸报道，最近从马来亚丛林中发现的巨大灰色动物，业经判明是世界上稀有的珍兽犀牛。这种犀牛的脚上有三趾，头上只有一角，被称为“爪哇犀牛”。
    大约在1927年前，这种犀牛曾被人用摄影机拍过一次照片，但此后再没有被人发现过。
    旧邮票价值连城
    一张票面为一便士的旧邮票，3月25日在伦敦被两个英国商人以四千五百英镑的空前高价买去。
    这张邮票是1847年在印度洋英属莫里希厄斯岛发行的，据说世界上现在只有两张这样的邮票了。
    交换妻子
    据美国报纸报道：美国一个名叫施华兹的眼科医生和一个名叫布洛克斯的花圃用品供应店老板最近决定互相交换妻子，现在正在赶办离婚和结婚手续。
    去年11月，加利福尼亚州的奥莫洪德罗和凯普斯曾经交换了妻子、子女和住宅。
    有趣的对比
    3月11日的伦敦“泰晤士报”报道：英国教育大臣黑尔什姆说：“英国平均每人每年的教育费是十个英镑，这个数目仅占我们花在抽烟、饮酒、请客和赌博上的费用的四分之一。”
