    Correcting Cadres' Attitudes Towards Children's Enrollment and Employment
    In order to correct cadres' attitudes towards their children's enrollment in schools and employment, it is necessary for Party committees at all levels to explain this principle to the cadres. Kang Shumin, Secretary of the Shijiazhuang Municipal Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, recently made a report on correctly treating the issue of children's enrollment and employment at a meeting of over one thousand cadres from municipal-level organizations. He explained that this summer, a considerable number of graduating students from higher elementary schools, junior middle schools, and some senior middle schools will not be able to enter higher-level schools, and some of these students are children or relatives of cadres. Cadres should have a correct understanding of this issue. The educational task of primary and secondary schools, in addition to sending a portion of new students to higher-level schools, is also to supply the country's production and construction with a large number of reserve forces with a certain level of cultural education.

    When talking about participating in production, Kang Shumin said that it is best to let students participate in agricultural production. Cadres should comfort their children who fail to get into schools and mobilize them to go to labor posts, explaining that it is not a pity for higher elementary, junior middle, and senior middle school students to participate in agricultural production; it is glorious and a contribution to the cause of socialist construction to bring knowledge to the countryside, build a new countryside, and promote the rapid development of agriculture. Kang Shumin also mentioned that students who return to the countryside do not necessarily have to become cadres, because they lack experience and should learn production techniques from veteran farmers; but if they work well and are supported by the masses, they may also be elected as cadres.

    The approach of the Shijiazhuang Municipal Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is very good and greatly helps to correct cadres' understanding. Party committees in various localities can also do the same. In order to ensure and improve the level of political and ideological work for students and achieve good results, Party committees at all levels should also frequently give reports to students.

    端正干部对子女  升学就业的态度
    为了端正干部对子女升学和就业的态度，各级党委有必要向干部讲清这个道理。中共石家庄市委书记康修民，最近在市级机关一千多名干部大会上，做了正确对待子女升学就业问题的报告。他说明今年暑假有相当一部分高小、初中和一部分高中毕业生，不能升入高一级学校，其中有些学生是干部的子女或亲属。干部对这个问题，应该有正确的认识。中小学的教育任务，除给高一级学校输送一部分新生外，就是给国家生产建设上输送大批的具有一定文化教养的后备力量。
    在谈到参加生产的时候，康修民说，最好是让学生参加农业生产。干部对考不上学的子女，要安慰他们，动员他们到劳动的岗位上去，说明高小、初中和高中学生参加农业生产并不可惜；把知识带到农村去，建设新农村，促进农业迅速的发展，这是光荣的，也是对社会主义建设事业的贡献。康修民还谈到，学生回到农村后，不一定就当干部，因为他们缺乏经验，应该向老农学习生产技术；但他们劳动好，群众拥护，也可能被选为干部。
    中共石家庄市委这样做法是很好的，对于端正干部的认识有很大帮助。各地党委也可以这样做。为了保证和提高对学生进行政治思想工作的水平，取得良好效果，各级党委还要经常向学生做报告。
