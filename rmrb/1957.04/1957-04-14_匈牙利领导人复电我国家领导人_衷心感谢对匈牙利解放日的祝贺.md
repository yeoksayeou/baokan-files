Xinhua News Agency, 13th dispatch: The Hungarian People's Republic's state leaders' reply telegram to our state leaders, the full text is as follows:

To Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China:
To Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China:
To Comrade Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China:

Please accept our heartfelt and sincere thanks for your congratulations on the twelfth anniversary of our country's liberation.

On the twelfth anniversary of the liberation of their homeland, the working people of Hungary have reason to proudly look back on the most glorious period in Hungarian history, during which they have made great achievements in socialist construction with the constant and multifaceted fraternal support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The Hungarian people will forever be grateful to the great Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all the countries of the socialist camp for their sincere and selfless assistance to the Hungarian People's Republic, which suffered attacks from imperialism and Hungarian counter-revolutionaries. We are convinced that only with such selfless assistance from the socialist camp were we able to completely eliminate the domestic and foreign counter-revolutionaries who launched armed attacks on the Hungarian workers' regime, begin normal economic life, and defend the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, under the leadership of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, will continue to make every effort to unite all democratic forces headed by the working class and effectively strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat. The Hungarian-Chinese talks held in Budapest this year in the spirit of proletarian internationalism and the Hungarian-Soviet talks recently concluded in Moscow have further given us the strength to resolutely defend our country's independence and improve the welfare of the Hungarian people.

We believe that for the benefit of the people of China and Hungary, the fruitful fraternal friendship between our two peoples will continue to develop and be continuously strengthened in the future.

    István Dobi, President of the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic
    János Kádár, Prime Minister of the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government
    Imre Horváth, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Hungarian People's Republic

    匈牙利领导人复电我国家领导人
    衷心感谢对匈牙利解放日的祝贺
    新华社13日讯　匈牙利人民共和国国家领导人致我国国家领导人的复电，全文如下：中　华　人　民　共　和　国　主　席　毛　泽
　东　同　志：中国全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员长刘少奇同志：中华人民共和国国务院总理兼外交部长周恩来同志：
    请接受我们对您们在我国解放十二周年时的祝贺表示衷心的、真诚的感谢。
    匈牙利的劳动人民在祖国解放十二周年时，有理由骄傲地回顾在匈牙利历史上最光荣的一段时期内，在社会主义建设方面，在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的经常的、多方面的兄弟支援下所取得的巨大成就。匈牙利人民永远感激伟大的苏联、中华人民共和国和社会主义阵营的一切国家给予遭受帝国主义和匈牙利反革命分子攻击的匈牙利人民共和国的真诚无私的援助。我们深信，只有在社会主义阵营的这种无私的援助下，我们才得以完全消灭了武装进攻匈牙利工人政权的国内外反革命分子，开始了正常的经济生活，保卫了无产阶级专政。
    匈牙利工农革命政府在匈牙利社会主义工人党的领导下，今后仍将尽一切努力团结以工人阶级为首的全体民主力量，有效地加强无产阶级专政。今年本着无产阶级国际主义的精神在布达佩斯举行的匈中会谈和不久前在莫斯科结束的匈苏会谈进一步地给予了我们力量，以坚决保卫我国的独立并提高匈牙利人民的福利。
    我们相信，为了中匈两国人民的利益，我们两国人民的有成就的兄弟友谊今后将会进一步发展并不断加强。　匈牙利人民共和国主席团主席道比·伊斯特万
         匈牙利人民共和国工农革命政府总理卡达尔·亚诺什
         匈牙利人民共和国外交部长霍瓦特·伊姆雷　4月11日
