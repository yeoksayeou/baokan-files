    Simplification and Complication of Characters
    Bai Han
    Things always develop dialectically, and often two opposing trends exist simultaneously. The evolution of Chinese characters is also like this. For example, the character "车" (chē, car) had a rather complex structure in ancient writing, depicting things like the car's shaft, and more than one wheel. By the time of the Small Seal script, it had simplified to almost the same as the current "车" character, only the middle wheel was still round. This trend of simplification continues to develop to this day. Some characters have already been simplified, but people are still not satisfied and want to continue simplifying them. For example, the character "廟" (miào, temple) was previously simplified to "?", but later it was simplified to "庙" (miào). Current simplified characters such as "属" (shǔ, belong) and "嘱" (zhǔ, entrust) have far fewer strokes than the original traditional characters, but people still want to find ways to simplify them further, such as simplifying them to "?, ?". If this trend develops to the extreme, it can sometimes cause confusion, such as simplifying "费用" (fèiyòng, expenses) to "弗用" (fúyòng), which has the opposite meaning.

    On the other hand, people are also leading the writing towards complication (complication of strokes and complication of the number of characters). For example, the character "梁" (liáng, beam) already has "木" (mù, wood), but it still has to add another "木" radical. The character "帐" (zhàng, tent/account) originally had both meanings of "蚊帐" (wénzhàng, mosquito net) and "帐目" (zhàngmù, account), but it has to be differentiated, and another character "账" (zhàng, account) is created for "帐目". Some people defend this kind of differentiated character, believing that it is a manifestation of the precision of writing. Indeed, many phonetic loan characters have added radicals and become phonetic-semantic characters, which have played a role in distinguishing homophones. This is probably the reason why Chinese characters have to be somewhat complicated! But the truth is always relative, and just like simplification exceeding the necessary limit is not a good thing, complication exceeding the necessary limit is also not a good thing. To say that every differentiated character is good is a bit hard to agree with.

    For example, the character "板" (bǎn, board). If we add "木" (mù, wood) in front of it, it is "木板" (mùbǎn, wooden board); if we add "钢" (gāng, steel), it is "钢板" (gāngbǎn, steel plate); if we add "石" (shí, stone), it is "石板" (shíbǎn, stone slab). Now people want to change the "板" (bǎn) in "钢板" (gāngbǎn) to "钣" (bǎn), what is the necessity of this? Metal wire, iron wire, and copper wire are certainly different from silk thread, linen thread, and woolen thread, which can be understood from the characters added in front of "线" (xiàn, thread); but now some people want to create another character "?" (if it is inferred according to the "线" character, it should be "钱" (qián, money)) for metal wire, what is the necessity of this? Similarly, in the words freckles, hemorrhoids, stomach disease, suppuration, and healing, what is the necessity of adding "疒" (chuáng, disease radical) to the "斑, 漏, 胃, 脓, 愈" at the beginning of these characters? Can't the original characters make people understand?

    I remember when I was in school when I was a child, the "溜" (liū, glide) in "蒸溜水" (zhēngliūshuǐ, distilled water) had the water radical, but now I don't know how it became the troublesome "馏" (liú, steam) character; the "胞" (bāo, cell) in "胞子植物" (bāozizhíwù, spore plant) was originally the same as the "胞" (bāo) in "同胞" (tóngbāo, compatriot), but now it has been replaced by a newly emerging "孢" (bāo); the "倍" (bèi, times) in "五倍子" (wǔbèizi, gallnut) seems to have always been "倍" (bèi) since the "Compendium of Materia Medica", but now it has evolved into "棓" (bàng). I specifically consulted the "辞海" (cíhǎi, dictionary) for this character. I regret that this great dictionary is outdated, it did not note the meaning of "五倍子" (wǔbèizi) and the pronunciation of "倍" (bèi) under the "棓" (bàng) character, but noted some other pronunciations and meanings. But at the same time, my mind always resists these emerging characters a bit, and I always feel that the trouble of making type molds, the consumption of lead for casting, and the burden on children's learning should also be considered in certain situations.

    I also found that some characters, after being changed into new phonetic-semantic characters, not only do not make the meaning of the words clearer, but also obscure the meaning of the word roots, making it impossible to see the origin of the words. For example, the "斗" (dǒu, dipper) of "斗笠" (dǒulì, bamboo hat) precisely indicates that the shape of the hat is like a "斗" (dǒu), but adding a bamboo radical on top of it will not express the meaning of "斗" (dǒu). The "鼓" (gǔ, drum) of "鼓胀病" (gǔzhàngbìng, tympanites) precisely indicates that the patient's stomach is distended like a drum, but adding a meat radical next to it will not express the meaning of being like a "鼓" (gǔ). Similarly, changing "连枷" (liánjiā, flail) to "槤枷" or "?耞" will not express the meaning of "连" (lián, connect); changing "洗床" (xǐchuáng, washing bed) to "铣床" (xǐchuáng, milling machine) will not express the meaning of "洗" (xǐ, wash) (even the pronunciation may be mistaken for T—?); changing "旋床" (xuánchuáng, lathe) to "镟床" (xuànchuáng, turning lathe) will not express the meaning of "旋" (xuán, rotate); changing "保母" (bǎomǔ, nanny) to "媬姆" (bāomǔ, wet nurse) will not express the meaning of "保护" (bǎohù, protect); changing "上鞋" (shàngxié, put on shoes) to "鞘鞋" (qiàoxié, scabbard shoes) will not express the meaning of "加上去" (jiāshàngqù, add on); and so on.

    I think that if we save this kind of excessively complicated writing a bit, it will only be beneficial to cultural life, and will not be harmful.

### 字的简化和繁化

    字的简化和繁化
    柏寒
    事物总是辩证地发展的，往往两种相反的趋势同时存在。汉字的演变也是这样，例如一个“车”字，在古文字里，它的构造是相当复杂的，画出了车辕之类的东西，轮盘也不只一个，到了小篆，就简化到和现在的“车”字差不多的样子了，只中间那个轮盘还是圆的。这种简化的趋势直到今天还是在继续发展。有些字，已经简化过了，人们还不满足，还要继续简化它。比方一个“廟”字，从前已经简成“?”了，后来却还要简成“庙”。现在的简化字如“属、嘱”之类，比原来繁体字的笔画要少得多了，可是人们还要想法子再简化它，比方简成“?、?”之类。这种趋势尽量发展，有时会造成混乱，如把“费用”简成“弗用”，意思就恰好相反。
    在另一方面，人们却又把文字引向繁化（笔画的繁化和字数的繁化）。比方“梁”字已经从木，还要加个“木”旁。“帐”字本来兼有“蚊帐”、“帐目”两种意义，却要把它分化，另外给“帐目”另造一个“账”字来。有些人为这种分化的字辩护，认为这是文字精密化的表现。的确，有不少假借字加上偏旁，变成形声字，是起了分别同音词的作用。这也就是汉字不得不有些繁化的理由吧！但是真理总是相对的，正和简化超出必要的限度不是好事一样，超出必要限度的繁化也不是好事；要说每个分化出来的字都是好的，这也就有点令人难以同意。
    比方一个“板”字，我们在它前面加个“木”字，就是“木板”；加个“钢”字，就是“钢板”；加个“石”字，就是“石板”。现在人们要把“钢板”的“板”字改成“钣”，这到底有什么必要呢？金属线、铁线、铜线当然和丝线、麻线、毛线不同，这是可以从“线”前面附加的字了解的；但是现在有人要给金属线另造一个“?”字（如果按“线”字类推，就该是“钱”字了），这又有什么必要呢？同样，在雀斑、痔漏、胃病、化脓、治愈这些词儿中间的“斑、漏、胃、脓、愈”等字头上加个“疒”，这又有什么必要呢？难道原来的字不能使人了解吗？
    记得小时候在学校念书的时候，书上的“蒸溜水”的“溜”字是水旁的，现在不知怎样变成个麻烦的“馏”字了；“胞子植物”的
  “胞”本来和“同胞”的“胞”一样，现在却为一个新兴的“孢”所代替了；“五倍子”的“倍”自“本草纲目”以来，好像都是“倍”，现在却进化为“棓”了。我特地为了这个字翻查了“辞海”，我很惋惜这部大辞书过时了，它竟没有在“棓”字下注出“五倍子”的意思和“倍”字的音来，而注了些旁的音义。可是同时我的思想上总是对这些新兴的字儿有点抗拒，老觉得制造字模的麻烦，铸字用铅的耗费，以及孩子们学习上的负担，在一定场合也该考虑。
    我还发现有些字，改成了新的形声字以后，不但没有使词义更清楚，反而把词根的意义掩盖了，让人看不出语原来了。像斗笠的“斗”，正是表示笠形像“斗”，人们在它上面加一个竹头，就不能表达“斗”的意义了。鼓胀病的“鼓”，正是表示病人的肚子胀得和鼓一般，人们在它旁边加上个肉旁，就不能表达像“鼓”的意义了。同样地，把“连枷”改成“槤枷”或“?耞”，就不能表达“连”的意义；把“洗床”改成“铣床”，就不能表达“洗”的意义（连音都可能错成T—?）；把“旋床”改成“镟床”，就不能表达“旋”的意义；把“保母”改成“媬姆”，就不能表达“保护”的意义；把上鞋”改成“鞘鞋”，就不能表达“加上去”的意义；如此等等。
    我想，如果把这种过度繁化的文字节约一下，对文化生活只会有好处，不会有坏处的。
