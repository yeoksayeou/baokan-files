Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Calls for a ban on nuclear weapons tests continue to pour in from around the world.

The presidents of six Christian seminaries in the German Democratic Republic jointly issued an appeal to all German people on April 26, demanding a ban on all weapons that cause mass destruction. The appeal stated that the danger of nuclear weapons "not only threatens our generation but also our future generations." It called on everyone to work in their own positions to achieve the goal of banning and abolishing means of mass destruction. Bishop Dibelius, chairman of the Evangelical Church in Germany, also signed the appeal to show his support for this action.

On April 27, the All-Japan Student Self-Government Association held student rallies simultaneously in more than thirty locations across the country, protesting against British hydrogen bomb tests on Christmas Island and opposing the United States' transformation of Okinawa into a nuclear war base. About two thousand students from more than thirty universities and more than ten high schools participated in the Tokyo student rally. The assembly passed a declaration demanding that Britain stop conducting hydrogen bomb tests on Christmas Island, opposing the United States' transformation of Okinawa and various military bases in Japan into nuclear war bases, demanding the abolition of all unequal treaties between Japan and the United States, and opposing the United States' Middle East policy. It called on all Japanese students to concentrate their efforts to protest the British hydrogen bomb tests on May 17 through strikes, student rallies, and other means.

The international secretariat of the "International Christian Movement for Peace," the Swiss "Women's League for Peace and Freedom," and other social groups in Switzerland jointly appealed to the Swiss government on April 26 to join with other small countries' governments in demanding a cessation of nuclear weapons tests. They asked the Swiss government to consider suggesting convening an international conference of major powers to discuss this issue, which would also invite other countries to participate, especially countries like India and Japan. Before this joint appeal was issued, mass rallies were held in many Swiss cities to oppose nuclear weapons tests.

Former British Prime Minister and Labor Party leader Clement Attlee delivered a speech at Yale University in the United States on April 26, calling for a halt to nuclear weapons tests. He said that unless these tests are stopped now, they could be "harmful" to future generations of mankind. But he added: "The Labor Party, like the current government, also believes that we must possess atomic weapons as a means of deterring another world war." In his speech, Attlee also advocated that Western countries recognize China. He believes that the United States should not be "too afraid of Communist China." He also said: "Some people may not like it, but there is nothing people can do about it."

    世界各地呼声响不断
    要求禁止试验核武器
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：要求禁止原子核武器试验的呼声，继续不断地从世界各地传来。
    民主德国六所基督教神学院的院长26日联名发表一篇致全体德国人民的呼吁书，要求禁止一切造成大规模破坏的武器。呼吁书说，原子核武器的危险“不仅威胁着我们这一代，而且也威胁着我们的子孙后代”。它要求每一个人在自己的岗位上为达到禁止和废除大规模破坏手段的目标而努力。全德基督教新教教会主席迪贝留斯主教也在呼吁书上签了名，表示支持这一行动。
    全日本学生自治会总联合会4月27日在全国三十几个地方同时举行学生大会，抗议英国在圣诞岛试验氢弹和反对美国把冲绳岛变成核子战争基地。东京的学生大会有三十多个大学和十多个高中的学生约两千人参加。大会通过了宣言，要求英国停止在圣诞岛举行氢弹试验，反对美国把冲绳岛和日本各地军事基地变成核子战争基地。要求取消日美间的一切不平等条约，并且反对美国对中东的政策。呼吁全日本学生，集中力量，在5月17日用罢课、举行学生大会和其他方式抗议英国的氢弹试验。
    在瑞士的“国际基督教争取和平运动”国际秘书处、瑞士“妇女争取和平和自由同盟”以及其他一些社会团体26日联合呼吁瑞士政府同其他小国政府一同要求停止原子核武器试验。它们要求瑞士政府考虑建议召集一次大国国际会议来讨论这个问题，这个会议也邀请其他国家参加，特别是邀请像印度和日本这样的国家。在这个联合呼吁发出以前，瑞士许多城市都举行了群众大会，反对举行原子核武器试验。
    前英国首相、工党领袖艾德礼26日在美国耶鲁大学发表演说，要求停止原子核武器试验。他说，除非现在停止这种试验，否则就可能对人类后代“有害”。但他又说：“工党像目前的政府一样，也认为我们必须拥有原子武器，作为制止另一次世界大战的一种手段。”艾德礼在演说中还主张西方国家承认中国。他认为，美国不应该“过分害怕共产党中国”。他还说：“有些人可能不喜欢它，可是人们对它毫无办法。”
