Xinhua News Agency, April 21st: The PLA Literary Society recently invited writers and literary workers from the armed forces in Beijing to hold two discussion meetings to discuss how to implement the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy in the armed forces.

    The writers and literary workers present first expressed their opinions on Chen Qitong's "Some Opinions on Current Literary Work" and Chen Yi's "Literary Essays." Everyone believed that the arguments in these two articles were contrary to the Party's "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy. Writer Zhou Jiefu said: "Comrade Chen Qitong and others initially acknowledged the blossoming of a hundred flowers, but when it came to specific issues, they still advocated for one flower to bloom alone. 'Blooming' and 'contending' are complementary to serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, but Comrade Chen Qitong and others have set the two against each other. They seem to think that only Party members adhere to serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, separating Party members from the masses, which is sectarianism. Chen Yi's article is even more rude in its attitude, and he also sets historical themes against modern themes." Writer Yu Ji said: "The articles by Comrade Chen Qitong and others represent the thinking of a portion of the people, and this has been going on for a long time. I agree with the statement that this article is 'cognitively wrong, has a rude attitude, is inconsistent with the facts, and has bad consequences.' However, criticism of them should not be completely negated but should distinguish between right and wrong and be based on facts."

    Some people also reviewed at the meeting that they had once agreed with Chen Qitong's articles and deeply felt that their thinking had not kept up with the development of the times, resulting in a vague understanding of new things.

    Everyone believed that the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy is a policy to promote the prosperity of literature, art, and scientific work. Not only should the army resolutely implement this policy, but it can also fully implement this policy because the army has always had a fine democratic tradition. Writer Yu Ji said that the army requires a high degree of organization and discipline, which does not contradict "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend." We admit that the army has a high level of awareness and strong organization. What is there to fear about "blooming" and "contending"? Fragrant flowers are welcomed by everyone, and poisonous weeds are opposed by everyone. Writer Du Feng said: "Fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds can only be distinguished after 'blooming' and 'contending.' Of course, advocating 'contending' does not mean that leadership is not needed, but rather the issue of how to lead."

    Many writers and literary workers also raised opinions in their speeches about the use of administrative methods to interfere with literary work in the leadership of literary work and the damage caused by dogmatism to literary work in the army. Everyone believed that the main manifestations of dogmatism in literary work are mechanical, simplistic, and one-sided understandings of the policy of literature serving politics and serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the issue of writing "major themes" and "positive characters" in creation. Some of the formulations are in conflict with the Party's "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" policy. This has caused great harm to literary creation in the army.

    Everyone unanimously believes that it is necessary to study hard, change thinking, break free from the shackles of dogmatism, and ensure that the Party's "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy is effectively implemented in the army.

### 文艺创作不要受教条主义的束缚  解放军文艺工作者座谈“鸣”“放”方针

    文艺创作不要受教条主义的束缚
    解放军文艺工作者座谈“鸣”“放”方针
    新华社21日讯　解放军文艺社最近邀请在北京的部队作家和文艺工作者举行了两次座谈会，讨论如何在部队中贯彻“百花齐放，百家争鸣”方针的问题。
    到会的作家和文艺工作者首先就陈其通等的“我们对目前文艺工作的几点意见”和陈沂的“文艺杂谈”两篇文章发表了意见。大家认为，这两篇文章的论点是和党的“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针相违背的。作家周洁夫说：“陈其通等同志开头承认百花齐放，但谈到具体问题时，仍然是主张一花独放。‘鸣’、‘放’是和为工农兵服务相辅而成的，而陈其通等同志却把二者对立起来了。他们好像认为只有党员才坚持为工农兵服务，把党员和群众分开，这就是宗派主义的情绪。陈沂的文章在态度上就更粗暴，他把历史题材和现代题材也对立起来了。”作家虞棘说：“陈其通等同志的文章代表了一部分人的思想，并且是由来已久的。我同意这样的说法，这篇文章是‘认识错误，态度粗暴，不合事实，后果不好’。但是对他们的批评，也不应当一棍子打死，而是要分清是非，实事求是。”
    有些人还在会上检查自己曾经赞成过陈其通等人的文章，深感自己的思想跟不上时代的发展，以致对新事物的认识模糊不清。
    大家认为，“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，是促进文学艺术和科学工作繁荣的方针。部队不但应该坚决贯彻这一方针，而且完全可以坚决执行这一方针，因为部队向来就有优良的民主传统。作家虞棘说，部队要求有高度的组织性纪律性，这和“百花齐放、百家争鸣”并不矛盾。我们既承认部队的觉悟高，组织性强，“放”出来“鸣”出来又怕什么？是香花大家欢迎，是毒草大家反对。作家杜烽说：“香花和毒草只有‘放’和‘鸣’了才能鉴别。当然，提倡‘鸣’不是不要领导，而是如何去领导的问题。”
    许多作家和文艺工作者在发言中，还对文艺工作的领导上用行政方式干涉文艺工作等许多问题和教条主义给部队文艺工作带来的损害，提出了意见。大家认为，教条主义在文艺工作上的主要表现，是把文艺为政治服务，为工农兵服务的方针，把创作上的写“重大题材”、“正面人物”等问题，作了机械的、简单的、片面的理解，有些问题的提法是和党的“百花齐放”方针相抵触的。这样就给部队文艺创作带来了很大的损害。
    大家一致认为，必须努力学习，扭转思想，从教条主义的束缚中解放出来，使党的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，在部队里切实地得到贯彻。
