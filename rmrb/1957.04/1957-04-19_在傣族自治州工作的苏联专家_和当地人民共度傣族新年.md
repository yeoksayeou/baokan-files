Xinhua News Agency, Yunjinghong, April 18th: Four Soviet experts, including Comrade Fedorov, who are working in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture of Yunnan Province, were invited to celebrate the "Jing Baimai" (Dai New Year) with the Dai people.

April 13th was the first day of the Dai New Year. According to traditional Dai customs, the annual dragon boat race was held on the Lancang River near Yunjinghong, the capital of the autonomous prefecture. More than a hundred Dai farmers and boatmen living on both sides of the Lancang River participated in the competition in six long, narrow dragon boats. A dragon boat rowed by Jingha farmers was the first to reach the finish line and won the pennant. The Autonomous Prefecture People's Committee awarded each participant a silver medal and a towel. Dao Youliang, the Deputy Governor, and Sun Ming, the Secretary of the CPC Autonomous Prefecture Working Committee, personally poured wine to congratulate the winners. The Soviet experts also presented each dragon boat with a red silk banner.
