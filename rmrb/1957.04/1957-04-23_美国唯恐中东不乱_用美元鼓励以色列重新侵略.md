　　America Fears No Turmoil in the Middle East
　　Encourages Israel to Re-invade with Dollars

　　This newspaper comprehensively reports: According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 22nd: Official sources in Washington stated that the United States has decided to resume aid to Israel. According to American news agencies, the United States will aid Israel with $25 million, and the first batch of aid materials has already been shipped.

　　At the same time, American newspapers also reported on provocative remarks made by Israeli officials with American connivance, and cheered on these remarks. According to the "New York Herald Tribune," Israeli Southern Command General Laskov recently announced at a press conference in New York that Israel "will retaliate against attempts to obstruct Israeli navigation in the Gulf of Aqaba."

　　An editorial in Cairo's "Al Shaab" (The People) on the 21st pointed out that while Israel is attacking the United Nations Emergency Force and threatening to re-invade Egypt and other Arab countries, the United States' statement shows that the United States is instigating Israel to oppose Arab countries in order to increase tensions in the Middle East and threaten peace in the Middle East.

　　The editorial said, even more strangely, the United States made this statement while it was insisting on freezing Egyptian dollar assets in the United States.

　　"Al Gomhuria" (The Republic) said that the United States' resumption of aid to Israel will facilitate Israel's new aggression that it is preparing to carry out, which shows that there is no difference between the policies of the United States and the policies of Israel.

    美国唯恐中东不乱
    用美元鼓励以色列重新侵略
    本报综合报道　据新华社22日讯：华盛顿官方负责人士表示，美国已决定恢复对以色列的援助。据美国通讯社报道，美国将援助以色列两千五百万美元，第一批援助物资已经启运。
    同时，美国报刊也报道了在美国纵容下以色列官方人物发表的挑衅言论，并且为这种言论助威。据“纽约先驱论坛报”报道，以色列军队南线司令拉斯考准将最近在纽约举行的一次记者招待会上宣布，以色列“将反击阻挠以色列在亚喀巴湾通航的试图。”
    开罗“人民报”21日社论指出，正当以色列在攻击联合国紧急部队，并且扬言要重新进攻埃及和其他阿拉伯国家的时候，美国发表这项声明表明美国是在唆使以色列反对阿拉伯国家，以便增加中东的紧张局势和威胁中东的和平。
    社论说，更奇怪的是：美国竟在它坚持冻结埃及在美国的美元资产的时候发表了这项声明。
      “共和国报”说，美国恢复对以色列的援助将便于以色列进行它正在准备进行的新侵略，这表明美国的政策和以色列的政策毫无区别。
