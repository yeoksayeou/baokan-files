    More than 20,000 households in Shanghai are now using "quick-fire" coal briquette stoves that are both fire-resistant and save coal briquettes.
    These stoves use waste materials such as mud bricks, broken bricks, or broken pottery to build a 冂-shaped or square low wall around the stove. The original purpose was a fire prevention safety measure, but after trial use, it was found that it could also save coal briquettes and cook rice and dishes faster than ordinary stoves.
    According to the person in charge of the Fire Department: Based on the current usage effect of residents, if all 200,000 households in the city that have fire-prone coal briquette stoves install this simple and inexpensive equipment, it will not only greatly benefit fire safety, but each household can also save about 20 catties of coal briquettes per month, and the city can save about 2,000 tons of coal briquettes per month.

    快火煤球炉
    上海市现有二万多户居民采用了既防火又能节省煤球的“快火”煤球炉。
    这种炉子是用泥砖、碎砖或破缸等废料，在炉子边砌起冂形或方形的矮围墙，原来目的是一种防火的安全措施，但在试用后发现还能节省煤球，煮饭烧菜也比一般炉子快。
    据消防处负责人说：根据当前居民使用效果看，如果全市二十万户有碍防火的煤球炉都添装这种简易省钱的设备，不但大大有利于防火安全，且每户每月可以节约二十斤煤球，全市每月约能节省两千吨煤球。（新华社）
