    Indian Dance
    India　Ke. En. Menon
    After seeing Kamala Laxman's performance of Bharata Natyam, a classical Indian dance, one is left with an unforgettable impression. Recently, Kamala Laxman visited China at the invitation of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries. Premier Zhou Enlai gave a high evaluation of Kamala's performing arts when he visited India at the end of last year.
    Bharata Natyam is widely considered to be the most delicate and graceful of all dance arts. Famous critics believe that this dance is richer in emotion than any other. The first surprise for audiences who watch Bharata Natyam for the first time is the dancer's unique style and graceful and varied movements. Facial expressions and artistic movements of the neck, shoulders, and arms play a major role in classical dance. For audiences who do not often see this kind of dance, it may be a little difficult to understand at first. But soon, people will be attracted by the magic of this dance technique. The dancer creates vivid artistic images. Her touching expressions, soft postures, bright costumes, exotic musical forms and tunes, original melodies, and rhythmic movements bring the audience into a charming fairyland.
    Bharata Natyam is India's national heritage. According to legend, it was performed by gods and then taught to humans. In the imagination of the Indians, Lord Shiva is the first dancer. It is said that when the gods watched him perform, he used frenzied movements and postures to express the various scenes of the creation, existence, and destruction of the great universe.
    Indian culture is one of the oldest cultures in the world. Since ancient times, this dance has been a major form of religious expression. After many years of refinement, it has such superb skills. In ancient times, it was performed by female devotees in temples.
    In those days, temples were the home of all arts and culture. Poets recited their works to the masses in temples, philosophical and theological discussions were also held in temples, and songs were also created and sung in temples. Temples were also the home of architecture and sculpture. Dancers and musicians were attached to temples. After prayers at the prescribed times, music and dance became an indispensable part of the religious and cultural life of the people. Since dance grew up in temples, it quickly became a ritual of reverence for the gods and thus developed into a custom. Most of the musicians were men, while the dancers were all women. Indian dancers choose themes from the great Indian epics such as the "Ramayana" and the "Mahabharata," and the dance movements express devotion to the gods. In later centuries, emperors and nobles felt that these well-trained girls could be used for court entertainment, so they began to hire them with a lot of money. Thus professional dancers appeared. Various schools of dancers performed not only in palaces but also at rural festivals and when entertaining foreign guests, competing with each other for novelty and victory. As a result, traditional dance moved from temples to the stage, gradually losing its original characteristic of devotion to the gods and becoming tinged with eroticism. As a result, from the mid-nineteenth century to the early twentieth century, this traditional Indian dance was completely buried.
    Around 1917, the great Indian poet Tagore became interested in this dance. The world-famous Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova introduced it to Europe in 1921. This further encouraged the Indians' desire to restore this dance and prompted many enthusiasts to restore Bharata Natyam to its ancient pure form.
    The Bharata Natyam restored by modern artists mostly maintains the purity of style and the traditional scenes of ancient girls performing in front of the temple gods. Its dance postures that embody singing and rhythm, and the coordinated movements of the limbs that accompany the rhythm of the music, create a poem of the spiritual world.
    Including the necessary musical interludes, each performance of Bharata Natyam takes two to three hours, usually performed by one person, sometimes by two or more people.
    The dancer's costume is a tight-fitting silk bodice embroidered with gold and silver threads, with a specially styled pleated cloth wrapped around the legs all the way to the ankles, and embroidered fabrics with pleats from the waist down to the knees. Bare feet, with some red patterns painted on the toenails and palms. When the hands and feet move quickly, flashes of light appear like countless sparks. The dancer wears gold necklaces and earrings, and sometimes nose rings, gold bracelets on her wrists, and a very elaborate belt inlaid with jade around her waist. Flowers are worn on the head, and long hair is tied into a beautiful braid with flower clips behind the head. A golden pendant inlaid with sparkling gems is worn on the forehead.
    The instruments usually used are mainly a round drum and a pair of cymbals. The performance of the dance is in time with the rhythm of these instruments. The dancer uses various postures and expressions to express the meaning of the singer's song. Their feet move with the rhythm of the music. Inner emotions of love, hatred, anger, heroism, sorrow, fear, anxiety, disgust, joy, and tranquility are expressed through the eyes and facial expressions. Postures can represent concrete and abstract things, some postures can represent animals, rivers, and mountains, etc., and no posture does not express a clear meaning. This figurative representation is extremely important, because only in this way can the exact meaning of the accompanying song be expressed. When a hero picks up a bow and draws it, the size, weight, rigidity, and the force required to draw the bow must be figuratively expressed by the dancer without anything in her hands. This extensive imagery enriches the art. Without this realistic creative talent, one cannot be considered a talented dancer.
    During the performance, the dancer's body becomes soft and light. When performing a series of postures, she initially dances slowly, gradually increasing the speed, until rapid jumps, bending over, and movements of the hands, feet, and body. These subtle movements are everywhere accompanied by appropriate music.
    In Indian dance, the role of musical melody differs in many ways from the role of accompaniment in Western dance, which specifies the mood and basic rhythm for the dancer. But in Indian dance, the musical melody tells the dancer and the audience how many beats there are in each musical phrase, so when the dancer makes a mistake, the careful audience can immediately hear it, not necessarily see where the mistake is. For a dancer, flexibility of movement is an important factor in success, which makes the dance a concrete image of the expression of music.
    Kamala Laxman enjoys a high status among the most outstanding representatives of Bharata Natyam in India. Other famous dancers include Tara Chaudhri, Indrani Rahman, Vijayatima Naidu and Travancore Lalitha, Badmini and Nachini sisters, etc. Kamala Laxman's visit to China this time will be a beneficial contribution to enhancing the friendship and understanding between the people of India and China.

    印度的舞蹈
    印度　克·恩·梅农
    看过印度卡玛拉·拉克希曼表演的婆罗多古典舞以后，有一种使人难以忘却的印象。最近，卡玛拉·拉克希曼应中国人民对外文化协会的邀请到中国进行访问演出。去年底周恩来总理在访问印度时，曾对卡玛拉的表演艺术有很好的评价。
    婆罗多舞已被普遍地认为是在所有舞蹈艺术中最细巧和优美的一种舞蹈。著名的批评家有这样的看法，认为这种舞蹈比其他任何舞蹈都富于感情。第一次看婆罗多舞的观众，首先惊奇地感受到的是舞蹈家的别有风格而柔美多样的动作。在古典舞中起很大作用的是脸部表情和颈、肩、臂部的艺术动作。对于那些不常看这种舞蹈的观众，开始时也许会觉得有些不易理解。但不久，人们就会被这种舞蹈技巧的魔力吸引住。舞蹈家创造了维妙维肖的艺术形象。她的动人的表情、柔和的姿势、鲜艳的服装、带有异国情调的音乐形式和曲调、独创的旋律以及有节奏的动作等等，这一切把观众带进迷人的仙境。
    婆罗多舞是印度的民族的遗产。据传说，它是由神表演的，后来才传教给人。在印度人的想像中，湿婆神是第一个舞蹈家。据说天神们围着看他表演时，他以狂热的动作和姿势，表现了伟大宇宙的创造、生存和毁灭的种种情景。
    印度的文化是世界上最古老的文化之一。自远古以来，这种舞蹈一直是宗教的一种主要表现形式。经过不少年代的提炼，它才具有这样精湛的技巧。在古时候它是由女信徒在庙宇里表演的。
    在那些日子里，庙宇是一切艺术和文化之家。诗人们在庙宇里向群众朗诵他们的作品，哲学和神学的讨论也在庙宇里举行，歌曲也在庙宇里创作和演唱。庙宇同时也是建筑和雕刻之家。舞蹈家和音乐家是附属于庙宇的。在做了规定时刻的祈祷以后，音乐和舞蹈便成为人民的宗教和文化生活中不可少的内容。由于舞蹈是在庙宇里成长起来的，所以它很快地变成敬神的一种仪式，并因而发展成为一种习俗。乐师大多数是男的，而舞蹈者则都是女的。印度舞蹈家从伟大的印度史诗像“罗摩耶那”和“摩诃婆罗多”中选择题材，舞蹈动作是表现对神的虔诚。在后来的几世纪里，皇帝和贵族觉得这些有很好训练的女孩子可供宫廷娱乐，就开始用很多的钱雇用她们。因此职业舞蹈家出现了。各派舞蹈家不仅在皇宫里而且在农村的节日里和招待外宾时表演舞蹈，互相争奇斗胜。从而传统性的舞蹈从庙宇里搬到舞台，逐渐地失去了原有的对神虔诚的特色，变得带有色情的情调。以致从十九世纪中叶到二十世纪初期，这种传统的印度舞蹈完全被埋没了。
    约在1917年以后，伟大的印度诗人泰戈尔对这种舞蹈发生了兴趣。闻名世界的俄国巴蕾舞蹈家安娜·潘芙洛娃在1921年又把它介绍到欧洲。这更鼓励了印度人恢复这种舞蹈的意愿，并促使许多热心的人把婆罗多舞恢复了古代纯洁的面貌。
    由现代艺术家恢复起来的婆罗多舞，大部分保持了风格上的纯洁性和古代少女们在庙神前演出时的传统场面。它那体现歌声和韵律的舞姿，和协调地伴随音乐节奏的四肢动作，创造了精神世界的诗篇。
    包括必要的音乐插曲在内，每表演一次婆罗多舞，需要两小时到三小时，通常由一个人表演，有时两个人或更多的人。
    舞蹈者的服装，上身是用金银线绣的紧身丝质胸衣，从腿上一直到足踝，围着有特殊式样的褶边卷布，从腰以下，有褶边的绣花织物一直盖到膝头。赤着脚，脚指甲和手掌心涂一些红色的图案。当手脚快速地舞动时，现出了仿佛是无数火花的闪光。舞蹈者戴着金项圈和耳环，有时也戴鼻环，手腕上戴着金手镯，腰间围着十分精巧的镶有玉石的腰带。头上戴着花，背后拖着长发和花夹在一起编成的很漂亮的辫子。前额戴上镶有闪闪发光的宝石的金色垂饰。
    通常所用的乐器主要的是圆鼓和一对铙钹。舞蹈的表演合着这些乐器的节拍。舞蹈者用各种姿势和表情表达歌唱者所唱的意思。她们的两足随着音乐的韵律而移动。爱情、仇恨、愤怒、英勇、忧愁、惧怕、焦急、厌恶、快乐和宁静的内心情感都用眼睛和脸部表情表现出来。姿势能够表示具体和抽象的事物，有些姿势可以表示动物、河流和山脉等，没有哪一种姿势不表达明确的意思的。这种形象化的表现手法极其重要，因为只有这样才能表达伴奏歌曲的确切意思。当一个英雄拿起弓和拉开它时，弓的大小、重量、硬性、拉弓所需要的气力等等，都要舞蹈者在手里没有任何东西的条件下形象地表现出来。这种广泛的形象表现，丰富了艺术。如果没有这种现实主义的创造才能，便不能算是具有天才的舞蹈家。
    表演时，舞蹈者的身段变得柔软而轻盈。当表演一系列的姿态时，起初她缓缓起舞，逐渐速度加快，一直到急速的跳跃、弯腰、手脚和身躯的舞动，这些微妙的动作处处都有恰到好处的音乐伴奏。
    在印度舞蹈中，音乐旋律的作用在很多方面与西方舞蹈伴奏的作用不同，后者给舞蹈者规定了情调和基本的节拍。但在印度舞蹈中，音乐旋律告诉舞蹈者和观众在每一乐组里有多少跳的节拍，因此当舞蹈者跳错时，细心的观众马上就能听出，倒不一定是看出什么地方跳错了。对于一个舞蹈家来说，动作的灵活性是成功的重要因素，她使得舞蹈成为音乐的具体形象的表现。
    在印度的婆罗多舞最杰出的代表中，卡玛拉·拉克希曼享有很高的地位。其他闻名的舞蹈家还有塔拉·乔德丽、印德拉尼·拉赫曼、维贾耶梯玛那和特拉佛科·拉丽塔、巴德米尼和那其尼姊妹等。这次卡玛拉·拉克希曼到中国的访问演出，对增进印、中两国人民的友谊和了解，将是一个有益的贡献。
