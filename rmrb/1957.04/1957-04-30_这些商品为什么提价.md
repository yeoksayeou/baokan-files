These Commodities Are Priced Up

    Pork
    According to the State Council's instructions, the national purchase price of live pigs was increased starting March 1 this year, and the sales price of pork was also appropriately increased. As everyone knows, in recent years, the production of live pigs has declined, and the supply of meat has been tight. In addition to reasons such as insufficient feed, the low purchase price of live pigs is also an important reason. Although the purchase price of live pigs after liberation is already about 10% higher than the pre-war ratio to grain prices, the conditions for raising pigs have changed after agricultural cooperation. In the past, farmers could raise pigs with the attitude that "raising pigs doesn't make money, but look at the fields." Now, agricultural cooperatives must calculate costs when raising pigs, and agricultural cooperative members must also compare raising pigs with participating in collective labor for work points. In this way, the original purchase price of live pigs appears low. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary for the state to raise the purchase price of live pigs to promote the development of the pig-raising industry. While raising the purchase price, the sales price should naturally also be raised accordingly. However, this time the increase in pork sales price is less than the increase in the purchase price of live pigs. On a national average, the purchase price of live pigs has increased by 14%, while the sales price of pork has only increased by 7%. The portion of the increase in the purchase price of live pigs is not entirely passed on to consumers. The difference is subsidized by the state by reducing slaughter taxes and reducing commercial profits. The state will have to spend more than 180 million yuan on this subsidy alone. Therefore, with the simultaneous increase in the purchase price of live pigs and the sales price of pork, the state has not only not increased its income, but has reduced it.
    If each person in the country who eats pork consumes an average of 10.5 jin of pork per year, each person will only spend an extra 4 jiao 5 fen 3 li per year. A family of five will only spend an extra 2 yuan 2 jiao 6 fen 5 li per year due to the increase in pork sales price.
    Edible Salt
    According to the instructions of the State Council, from January 1 this year, the sales price of edible salt has been increased to varying degrees throughout the country.
      There are two main reasons for this increase in salt prices. One is that salt prices have been low for several years since liberation. This is mainly because the state drastically reduced salt taxes in order to reduce the burden on the people, especially after the national salt tax was changed to a monetary tax rate in June 1950, the tax amount was reduced by nearly half. From 1951 to 1954, the wholesale chain index of salt decreased by 5.2%, while the national price level remained close to balanced during the same period, so the salt price was appropriately increased. The second reason is that salt prices are not balanced throughout the country. This imbalance was formed due to historical conditions and should now be adjusted to make it reasonable.
      After the salt price adjustment, if calculated based on each person consuming 12.5 jin per year, each person will only spend an extra 2 jiao 1 fen. A general family of five will only spend an extra yuan or so per year. Therefore, this will not have a major impact on people's lives.
    Oils and Oilseeds
    According to the instructions of the State Council, over the past year, the purchase prices of oilseeds such as rapeseed, sesame, tea oil, tung oil, wood oil, and Chinese tallow tree oil have been increased to a greater extent throughout the country, depending on the different situations. The purchase price of soybeans in the three northeastern provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has been appropriately increased. After separately increasing the purchase prices of the above-mentioned various oilseeds and oils, the State Council decided to raise the sales prices of these oils and oilseeds accordingly, starting from April 10 this year. According to the principle of "who benefits, who pays," it is appropriate for consumers to spend a little more money to meet their needs. However, in order not to excessively increase the burden on consumers, the State Council's instructions stipulate that the sales price of edible oil should be increased less and the tax rate on rapeseed oil should be reduced. In this way, the state will increase expenditures and reduce income by a total of about 30 million yuan per year due to sales prices not covering purchase prices and tax reductions.
    Because the increase in the purchase price of oils and oilseeds varies from place to place, and the ratios between the prices of different varieties are different, the increase in sales prices varies, so the increase in expenses for consumers due to the increase in sales prices also varies. The sales prices of edible oils such as rapeseed oil, sesame oil, tea oil, and soybean oil have only increased by 6 fen to 1 jiao per jin in most areas; in some areas, each jin of oil has only increased by 1 fen to 4 fen; and in individual areas, each jin has increased by about 1 jiao 3 fen. For a general family of five, if they consume 2.5 jin of oil per month, most families will only increase their expenses by 1 jiao 5 fen to 2 jiao 5 fen per month; families in some areas with smaller price increases will only increase their expenses by 2 fen 5 li to 1 jiao per month; and families in individual areas with larger price increases will only increase their expenses by about 3 jiao 2 fen per month. This amount is very small.
    Woolen Fabric
    The Ministry of Commerce, according to the State Council's approval, adjusted the sales prices of woolen fabrics from March 20 this year, that is, the sales price of pure wool fabrics increased by about 25%, and the sales price of blended woolen fabrics increased by about 15%. This is the largest increase in the sales price of an industrial product in recent years.
    The main reason for the increase in woolen fabric prices is to appropriately compress domestic market consumption and ensure export needs in order to exchange for materials necessary for national economic construction. There is a basis for doing so. On the one hand, in terms of consumption objects, the consumption of woolen fabric is not widespread. According to statistics from Wangfujing Department Store in Beijing, in the fourth quarter of last year, 8,910 customer processing orders were handled, using a total of 17,330 meters of material, with an average of 1.94 meters of material used per order. By extrapolation, last year's national sales of 8.59 million meters of woolen fabric means that only 4.52 million people consumed woolen fabric nationwide. According to the department store's analysis, in all customers, delegations and interns going abroad, as well as international friends, account for about 50%, and the remaining 50% are general consumers. This material shows that woolen fabric is a high-end consumer product, and currently, people who consume woolen fabric domestically are a small number of people with higher purchasing power. After the sales price of woolen fabric is increased, it will not have any impact on the vast majority of people who do not consume woolen fabric.
    On the other hand, woolen fabric is currently one of the most profitable export commodities among various industrial products. The profit the state obtains from all aspects by weaving imported wool tops into woolen fabric for export accounts for about 60% of its export value. Such a high export profit is far beyond comparison with the export of various agricultural and sideline products. According to statistics, the export profits of several major agricultural and sideline products are 8.6% for frozen pork, 14.2% for peanut oil, and even the export profit of soybeans is only 35.6% at most. The value of the 6.5 million meters of woolen fabric exported in 1956 alone is equivalent to the export of 430,000 tons of soybeans, or 127,000 tons of peanut oil, or 84,000 tons of frozen pork.
    Currently, our country's exports mainly rely on agricultural and sideline products and industrial products made from agricultural raw materials, and many of these materials are currently in short supply domestically. Last year, our country exported 140,000 tons of frozen pork, and everyone deeply felt how difficult it was to export this pork! However, exporting 6.5 million meters of woolen fabric can be exchanged for more than 400,000 tons of steel, or it can be exchanged for more than ten spinning mills with 50,000 spindles each. How significant is this for the country's socialist construction, and the vast majority of people domestically do not feel that it has any impact on their lives. Therefore, it can be seen that striving to export as many materials as possible that are not needed by the vast majority of people, such as woolen fabric, etc., to reduce the export of some consumer goods necessary for people's daily lives (this year's export quantity of frozen pork is two-thirds less than last year) is a very beneficial thing for the people.

    这些商品为什么提价
    猪肉
    根据国务院的指示，全国从今年3月1日起，提高了生猪的收购价格，同时也适当地提高了猪肉的销售价格。大家知道，近年来生猪生产下降，肉食供应紧张，除了饲料不足等原因以外，生猪收购价格偏低也是一个重要原因。解放后生猪的收购价格虽然已经高于战前同粮食比价的10％左右，但是农业合作化以后，养猪的条件发生了变化，过去农民养猪是可以“养猪不赚钱，回头看看田”的，现在农业社养猪必须核算成本，农业社社员养猪也要同参加集体劳动记工取酬的条件作比较。这样，原来的生猪收购价格就显得低了。所以国家提高生猪收购价格，以促进养猪业的发展是完全必要的。在提高收购价格的同时，销售价格自然也应当相应地提高。但是这次猪肉销价却比生猪收购价提得少，按全国平均，生猪的收购价格提高了14％，猪肉的销售价格只提高了7％。生猪收购价格提价的部分，并没有完全转嫁到消费者身上，这中间的差额是由国家用降低屠宰税和减少商业利润的办法来贴补的。仅是这项贴补，国家就要拿出一亿八千多万元。所以这次生猪收购价格同猪肉销售价格同时上调，国家不但没有增加收入，反而减少了收入。
    全国吃猪肉的人，平均按每人一年吃十斤半猪肉计算，一人一年才多花四角五分三厘，一个五口之家因猪肉销价上涨，一年多支出的费用，只有二元二角六分五厘。
    食盐
    根据国务院的指示，从今年1月1日起，全国各地不同幅度地提高了食盐的销售价格。
      这次食盐提价的主要原因有两个。一个是，解放以后几年来，盐价一向偏低。这主要是因为当时国家为了减轻人民负担，曾经大幅度地降低了盐税，特别是1950年6月全国盐税改为货币税率后，税额降低了将近一半。1951年至1954年这四年中，盐的批发连环指数下降了5.2％，而同期全国整个物价接近平衡，所以适当地提高了盐价。第二个原因是，全国各地盐价不平衡，这种不平衡是由于历史条件形成的，现在应该加以调整，使之合理。
      盐价调整以后，若按每人每年食用十二斤半计算，一个人才多花两角一分钱，一般五口之家一年才多花一元多钱。因此，这对人民生活是不会发生多大影响的。
    油脂油料
    根据国务院的指示，一年来在全国范围内，分别按照不同情况，在较大程度上提高了油菜籽、芝麻、茶油、桐油、木油、桕油等油料的收购价格，适当地提高了东北三省和内蒙古自治区的黄豆收购价格。在分别提高了以上各种油料油脂的收购价格以后，国务院决定从今年4月10日开始相应地提高这些油脂油料的销售价格。根据“谁享用，谁出钱”的原则，消费者为了满足自己的需要，相应地多出一点钱是应该的。但是，为了不至于过多地增加消费者的负担，国务院的指示规定，对食用油采取了少提销价并且减低菜油纳税率的办法。这样，国家每年因为销价不抵购价和税收减少而增加支出和减少收入共达三千万元左右。
    因为各地油脂油料收购价格提高的多少不同，品种之间的比价不一样，销售价格的提高有多有少，所以不同地区的消费者，因提高销售价格而增加的开支也有多有少。菜油、芝麻油、茶油、豆油等食用油的销售价格，在大部分地区，每一斤油只提高六分钱到一角钱；一部分地区，每一斤油只提高一分钱到四分钱；个别地区，每一斤油提高一角三分左右。一般五口之家，如果按每月每家吃油二斤半计算，大部分地区每家每月只增加开支一角五分到二角五分；一部分提价较少的地区，每家每月只增加开支二分五厘到一角；个别提价较多的地区，每家每月也只增加开支三角二分左右。这个数目是很小的。
    呢绒
    商业部根据国务院的批示，从今年3月20日起，调整了呢绒的销售价格，即纯毛呢绒销价提高25％左右，混纺呢绒销价提高15％左右。这是历年来工业品销售价格提高幅度最大的一个品种。
    呢绒提价的主要原因，是为了适当压缩国内市场的消费，保证出口的需要，以便换取国家经济建设所必需的物资。这样做是有根据的，一方面，从消费对象来说，呢绒的消费面不广。根据北京市王府井百货商店的统计，去年第四季度代客加工八千九百一十人次，共用料一万七千三百三十公尺，每人次平均用料一点九四公尺。以此类推，去年全国销售呢绒八百五十九万公尺，则全国消费呢绒的不过只有四百五十二万人次。据该商店分析，在全部顾客中，出国代表团和实习生以及国际友人约占50％，其余50％则是一般消费者。这个材料可以说明，呢绒是一种高级消费品，目前国内消费呢绒的人是少数购买力较高的人。呢绒的销售价格提高以后，对不消费呢绒的广大人民来说，没有一点影响。
    另一方面，呢绒是当前各种工业品中最为有利的一种出口物资。用进口毛条织成呢绒出口，国家从各方面取得的利润约占其出口值的60％。这样高的出口利润，远非出口各种农副产品所可比拟。据统计，几种主要农副产品的出口利润，冻猪肉为8.6％，花生油为14.2％，大豆的出口利润最多，也不过只有35.6％。仅1956年出口的六百五十万公尺呢绒的价值，就等于出口大豆四十三万吨，或者花生油十二万七千吨，或者冻猪肉八万四千吨。
    我们目前出口的物资，主要还靠农副产品和以农业原料制成的工业品，这些物资当中，有不少目前国内也是供应不足的。去年我们国家出口了十四万吨冻猪肉，大家都切身体会到出口这些猪肉是多么不容易！而出口六百五十万公尺呢绒，就可以换回四十多万吨钢材，或者可以换回十多个五万锭的纱厂，这对国家的社会主义建设，有多么大的意义，而国内广大人民并没有感觉到对自己生活有什么影响。由此可见，争取尽多的出口一些不是广大人民所需要的物资，如呢绒等，以减少一些人民日常生活必需的消费资料出口（今年的冻猪肉出口数量，比去年减少三分之二），是对人民很有利的一件事情。
