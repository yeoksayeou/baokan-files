Greening
In the Hometown of Martyr Yang Gensi
Xinhua News Agency dispatch: A large-scale greening campaign is underway in the hometown of Yang Gensi, the famous hero of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. Yang Gensi's hometown is Jinghu Township in Taixing County, Jiangsu Province. Recently, the youth of this township planted more than 82,400 trees, including more than 10,000 holly, pine, and cypress trees in the Yang Gensi Martyrs' Cemetery.

Chai Wende, a captain and former company commander of the Yang Gensi Company, and a comrade-in-arms of Yang Gensi during his lifetime, made a special trip from the Zhejiang coastal defense front to Jinghu Township before the Qingming Festival to sweep the tomb of the martyr. After participating in the public memorial ceremony, the captain and Yang Gensi's little niece jointly planted evergreen Pittosporum trees in front of the martyr's monument to express their eternal remembrance of the hero.

The township has already successfully planted more than 100,000 trees last year. Now, the leaf buds budding on some poplar, mulberry, and ginkgo trees are about to turn green; tender green new leaves have already emerged from the willow branches.

    绿化
    在杨根思烈士的家乡
    新华社讯　中国人民志愿军著名英雄杨根思烈士的家乡进行大规模的绿化。杨根思烈士的家乡是江苏省泰兴县井湖乡，这个乡的青年最近栽了八万二千四百多棵树，其中在杨根思烈士的陵园中就栽了一万多棵冬青、苍松、翠柏。
    杨根思烈士生前战友、曾任杨根思连的连长柴文德大尉，特地在清明节前从浙江海防前线赶到井湖乡来为烈士扫墓，这位大尉参加了公祭以后，同杨根思烈士的小侄女共同在烈士碑前种植了四季常绿的海桐树，表示对英雄的永远怀念。
    这个乡连去年种植成活起来的树已有十多万棵。现在一些白杨、桑树、银杏树上孕苞着的叶芽，都将吐青；柳树枝上已经放出了嫩绿的新叶。
