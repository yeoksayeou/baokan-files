Streamlined Organization, Improved Leadership Methods
By Our Correspondent Li Lianbin

Editor's Note: This newspaper has previously reported on examples of streamlining the upper levels, strengthening the lower levels, and improving grassroots work in rural areas. But after the transfer of cadres, has the work of the higher-level leading organs truly improved? This article provides an affirmative answer. It is hoped that after the streamlined leading organs have streamlined, they can indeed improve their leadership methods.

In early January, the Ji'an Special District of Jiangxi Province transferred 1,442 cadres from the special district and county-level organs to the countryside. The cadres transferred from the district committee organs accounted for 40% of the existing establishment, including nine district committee members, directors, and deputy directors, who went to various counties to serve as county party secretaries or deputy secretaries. After a large number of key personnel were transferred, the work of the district committee not only did not weaken but was strengthened compared to the past because the district committee adopted many measures to improve leadership methods.

Changing the Phenomenon of Undifferentiated Party and Government

In the past, the district committee managed the work of various units too much. As a result, the requests and reports from various units to the district committee were also very numerous. Every day, stacks of documents piled up in front of the district committee secretaries and directors, preventing them from concentrating their main energy on considering more important issues and trapping them in the quagmire of事務主義 [transactionalism, or excessive focus on administrative tasks].

After the transfer of cadres, the district committee was determined to change the phenomenon of undifferentiated Party and government and clarify leadership responsibilities. The administrative office established a Party group. The Party group was responsible to the district committee and led the work of the government and relevant units. In each county, district committee members, directors, and deputy directors directly led the work, which greatly reduced the number of requests to the district committee. District committee meetings and documents were also fewer than in the past. Several main responsible comrades of the district committee had time to study some major issues and were able to grasp the central links for leadership.

Departments Truly Become Assistants to the Party Committee

In order to become strong assistants to the Party committee, the departments also began to change the situation of managing the business work of various units too much. In the past, the departments had the phenomenon of substituting for certain departments in doing specific business work. For example, in the past, the Culture and Education Department managed even the appointment, dismissal, and leave of teachers; the Rural Work Department personally issued letters of introduction for cadres sent to the countryside by various units. Now, such trivial matters are no longer managed. The main task of the departments is to do investigation and research work and provide materials for the district committee to decide on work methods. The Rural Work Department has a total of seven cadres. They sent four cadres to the countryside to investigate the ideological situation of the transferred cadres and study the problems of agricultural cooperatives according to the intention of the district committee. In this way, the Rural Work Department played an assistant role.

Secretary Concurrently Serving as Department Director

The Ji'an District Committee has a total of four secretaries. One is on leave for study, and there are usually three people working. First Secretary Zhu Jixian is responsible for overall work, Second Secretary Zhao Chou concurrently serves as the Director of the Rural Work Department, and Deputy Secretary Zhao Bolun concurrently serves as the Director of the United Front Work Department.

The district committee decided that the secretary should concurrently serve as the director of the department, starting from strengthening the work of the department. According to the past work of the district committee, it was certainly unable to manage so much. But now the situation is completely different. Taking Comrade Zhao Chou, the secretary concurrently serving as the director, as an example, in the past, many trivial matters of the government, enterprises, and institutions needed to be handled by him. Every day, he was entangled in personal talks, reviewing documents, and attending meetings, and he did not have time to study the situation and problems well. Now, some trivial matters are gone. He can spend 70% to 80% of his time handling the work of the Rural Work Department every day, personally answering the questions requested by the lower levels, reviewing the manuscripts of the "Rural Communication," and studying problems together with the comrades of the department. In this way, the questions requested by the lower levels can be answered in a timely manner, and the spirit of the district committee can be implemented in a timely manner, reducing many levels and links. In the past, the questions requested by the lower levels often could not be answered in a timely manner. The staff asked the section chief, the section chief asked the department director, and the department director asked the secretary, going through several levels. From the perspective of the secretary himself, because he personally handles the problems, it is easier to grasp the overall situation and systematically study the problems. In the two months that Secretary Zhao has been concurrently serving as the director, he has studied the problems after the consolidation of the cooperatives, enriched his guiding ideology, and is conducive to the overall guidance of the district committee.

Going Deep into Reality for Investigation and Research

After the transfer of cadres, there are now only seven people in the district committee, including the secretary, the department director, and the deputy secretary-general. Because they are free from事務主義 [transactionalism, or excessive focus on administrative tasks] and have changed the past chaotic situation, they have ample time to go deep into the grassroots for investigation and research work. All leading comrades, including the First Secretary (except for those attending meetings in the province), can generally spend more than one-half of their time each month going deep into the grassroots for investigation and research work. In the past two months, they have investigated the attitudes and views of township cadres towards returning to production posts, the class situation of realizing cooperation in rural areas, and so on. In this way, the district committee can grasp the central links to guide the work. The practice of the past two months has proved that as long as we vigorously improve the leadership methods of the district committee organs and go deep into actual investigation and research work, it can become a regular system, making the district committee truly a strong leading organ.

    精简了机构　改进了领导方法
    本报记者　李连斌
    编者按：精简上层，充实下层，改进了农村基层工作的事例，本报已经有过报道。但是干部下放以后，上级领导机关的工作是否真正也有改进呢？这篇文章作了肯定的答复。希望经过精简的领导机关，在精简之后，能确实地改进自己的领导方法。
    江西省吉安专区1月初从专、县级机关中抽调了一千四百四十二名干部下乡。地委机关抽调的干部达现有编制的40％，其中有地委委员、地委正副部长九人，分别到各县担任县委书记或副书记的职务。大批骨干力量下放以后，由于地委会采取了许多措施来改进领导方法，地委的工作不但没有削弱反而比过去加强了。
    改变党政不分的现象
    地委过去对各单位的工作管理过多。这样，各单位向地委的请示和报告也就非常多，每天文件一叠一叠地堆在地委书记和部长的面前，使他们不能集中主要精力去考虑比较重要的问题，而陷在事务主义的泥沼里了。
    干部下放以后，地委决心改变党政不分的现象，划清领导责任。专署成立了党组。党组对地委负责，领导政府和有关单位的工作。各县有地委委员、正副部长直接领导工作，这样向地委请示的事就大大减少了，地委机关会议、文件也比过去少了。地委几个主要负责同志有时间研究一些重大的问题了，能够抓住中心环节进行领导了。
    各部真正成为党委的助手
    各部为了要成为党委的有力助手，也着手改变对各单位业务工作管得过多的情况。过去各部有代替某些部门做具体业务工作的现象。如过去文教部连教员任免、请假都管；农村工作部连各单位下乡干部的介绍信都亲自来开。现在类似这样的一些琐碎事情都不管了，各部的主要任务是做调查研究工作，给地委决定工作办法提供材料。农村工作部共有七个干部，他们抽出四个干部下乡，根据地委的意图调查下放干部的思想情况，研究农业社的问题。这样，农村工作部就起到了助手作用。
    书记兼部长
    吉安地委共有书记四人，一人离职学习，经常有三个人进行工作。第一书记朱继先同志负责全面工作，第二书记赵筹同志兼任农村工作部长，副书记赵拨轮兼任统战部长。
    地委决定书记兼部长是从加强部的工作出发的。如以地委过去的工作情况看，肯定是管不过来的。但现在情况完全不同了，以书记兼部长的赵筹同志来说，过去政府、企业和事业单位很多琐碎事情都需要他处理，每天纠缠在个人谈话、批阅文件和开会上面，没有时间很好地研究情况和问题，现在一些琐碎的事情没有了。他每天都能以70％到80％的时间处理农村工作部的工作，亲自答复下边请示的问题，审阅“农村通讯”的稿件和部的同志共同研究问题。这样下边请示的问题能及时得到答复，地委的精神能及时贯彻下去，减少了很多层次和环节。过去下边请示的问题往往不能及时答复，干事请示科长，科长请示部长，部长请示书记，经过几个层次。从书记本身讲，由于亲自处理问题，更易于掌握全面情况，系统地研究问题。赵书记兼部长两个月来，研究了整社后的问题，丰富了指导思想，有利于地委全面指导工作。
    深入实际调查研究
    干部下放以后，现在地委会连同书记、部长和副秘书长只有七人，有的书记还兼部长。由于摆脱了事务主义，改变了过去忙乱的情况，他们有充分的时间深入基层进行调查研究工作。所有的领导同志包括第一书记在内（到省开会的除外）一般每月都能以二分之一以上的时间，深入基层进行调查研究工作。近两个月来，他们调查了乡干部对回到生产岗位去这件事的态度和看法，农村实现合作化的阶级情况等等。这样，地委就能抓住中心环节指导工作。两个月来的实践证明，只要大力改进地委机关的领导方法，深入做实际调查研究工作可以成为一种经常性的制度，使地委真正成为有力的领导机关。
