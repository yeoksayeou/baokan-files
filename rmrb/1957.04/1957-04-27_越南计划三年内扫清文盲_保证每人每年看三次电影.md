Vietnam Plans to Eliminate Illiteracy in Three Years Guaranteeing Every Person Sees Three Movies a Year

    Eliminating Illiteracy Among Those Under Fifty This Year

    The famous Hong (Ji) Guang (An) coal mining area in northern Vietnam plans to completely eliminate illiteracy among workers under fifty years old this year. Since the restoration of peace until the end of last year, in a year and a half, two-thirds of the 2,500 illiterate workers in the entire mining area had learned to read and write. Many of the remaining one-third had also learned the alphabet, and they were eager to continue improving. Therefore, the mining area leadership decided to complete the task of eliminating illiteracy among workers under fifty years old within this year. The literacy campaign committee, composed of administration, trade union, and the government education bureau, is now stepping up its preparations. A short-term training course for 500 literacy teachers (including 250 workers) has already started, and 36 mobile literacy teams have also been established, ready to help workers with busy housework to study at home.

    According to statistics, a total of 920,000 people were made literate in northern Vietnam last year. The government of the Democratic Republic has formulated a three-year plan to eliminate all illiteracy in the three years from 1956 to 1958.

    The Vietnamese people's film industry, which was born in the mountains and forests during the war of resistance, has developed even more in the past year or two. Last year alone, the Vietnam Democratic Republic Film Studio produced 56 current affairs films, 10 documentaries, and completed the printing of Vietnamese subtitles for 26 foreign films and the dubbing of 8 foreign films. According to statistics, last year the total number of moviegoers reached 30 million, which means that each of the 13 million people in northern Vietnam watched more than twice movies on average.

    The government of the Democratic Republic plans to build a larger modern film studio this year and strive to produce Vietnam's first feature film. Many preparatory works are being stepped up. Experts Wu Mengbin, Yilin, and Han Shangyi, hired from China, are assisting in training talents in photography, directing, and art design. In addition, 35 Vietnamese filmmakers have gone to the Soviet Union, China, the German Democratic Republic, and other countries for further study. The government of the Democratic Republic also put forward the goal of increasing the number of film screenings to 51,000 in 1957, and the number of viewers to 40.06 million, so that every mass in the North can watch movies three times on average. In order to achieve this task, the government decided to help private cinemas develop, especially to expand mobile film projection teams and open more open-air film projection sites.

    越南计划三年内扫清文盲  保证每人每年看三次电影
    今年扫除五十岁以下的文盲
    越南北方著名的鸿（基）广（安）煤矿区，计划在今年内把五十岁以下的工人文盲完全扫清。自从恢复和平到去年年底，在一年半的时间里，整个矿区二千五百名文盲工人中，已经有三分之二的人学会了读和写，其余三分之一的人也有许多学会了字母，他们迫切地要求继续提高，因此矿区领导方面决定在今年一年内完成五十岁以下工人的扫盲任务。由行政、工会和政府教育局组成的扫盲委员会，现在正加紧进行准备工作。一个包括五百名（其中二百五十名是工人）扫盲教员的短期训练班已经开课，同时三十六个流动扫盲队也宣告成立了，准备帮助家务繁忙的工人在家里学习。
    据统计：去年一年，越南北方扫除文盲总数是九十二万人。民主共和国政府拟订了一个三年计划，争取在1956年到1958年三年中扫除全部文盲。
    抗战时期在山林里诞生的越南人民电影事业，最近一两年来更加发展了。去年一年里，越南民主共和国电影制片厂就摄制了五十六部时事片、十部纪录片，还完成了二十六部外国影片加印越文字幕和八部外国影片配音的工作。据统计，去年一年电影观众共达三千万人次，就是说越南北方一千三百万人每人平均看两次以上的电影。
    民主共和国政府计划在今年建设一个规模更大的现代化的制片厂，并争取摄制越南第一部故事片。现在许多准备工作都在加紧进行着。从中国聘请去的专家吴梦滨、伊琳、韩尚义等，正协助培养摄影、导演、美术设计等人材。此外，还有三十五名越南电影工作者已分头到苏联、中国、德意志民主共和国等去深造。民主共和国政府还提出指标，要求1957年电影放映场数增到五万一千次，观众增至四千零六十万人次，做到北方每个群众平均看三次电影。为了实现这个任务，政府决定帮助私营电影院发展，特别是扩大流动电影放映队和开设更多的露天电影放映场。

    越南民主共和国的“平民学务”是一种群众业余文化学习组织，在扫除文盲工作中收到很大的效果。这是越南北方泰族苗族自治区“平民学务”的一个班。
