Sharpness, Precisely for Healing and Saving Lives
	Yan Xu

After reading “The New Crisis of Essays,” I feel compelled to express some opinions that have been stuck in my throat for some time.

A month ago, I attended a symposium at a Shanghai newspaper. The comrade in charge of the newspaper said, “When essays engage in debate, they often easily grab others’ ‘pigtails’ and specialize in picking on others’ mistakes, thus carrying a great deal of one-sidedness. Therefore, we are considering whether to avoid using essays during debates. Even if we use essays, we must start from seeking common ground, first affirming the correctness of others in large quantities, and then making some supplements at points of disagreement. This approach is both comprehensive and doesn’t hurt people.”

These words triggered many thoughts in me. I thought, it is of course good not to hurt people, but if we must first give others “achievements are fundamental” and then “shortcomings exist,” and everyone responds to the call, thinking that only this is called “not hurting people,” then this is really a bit like the eight-legged essay style of breaking the topic, continuing the topic, starting the continuation, turning and combining. Comrade Hui Chun said that "medicine as medicine" "must be peaceful and balanced," which is certainly one aspect of the issue, but I agree more with another gentleman's analogy, who said that essays should be like the needle in the hand of an acupuncturist. He looks for the "acupoint" and pricks it, making people feel a little sore and a little painful. The effect of the needle is reflected in the cerebral cortex, and the disease is cured.

In fact, medicine is, after all, not like candy or tea. It is always a little bitter when you take it. As the saying goes, "bitter medicine is good for illness." We don't seem to need to cry and scream like a three-year-old child and shout "unacceptable" as soon as we smell bitterness.

Is it possible for essays to produce some side effects? Sometimes they naturally do, and that is the ideological one-sidedness of certain authors, rather than the fault of the essays themselves. If we therefore abolish all essays, or uniformly blunt their sharpness, and everyone comes to a stable and balanced position, I think this will only encourage bureaucracy.

Some people, upon hearing words like "sharp" and "pointed," immediately break out in a cold sweat and immediately associate them with labels flying everywhere and malicious ridicule. In fact, I think sharpness and pointedness should only be the twin brothers of profound ideological content, or that the former is the form and outer shell of the latter. True sharpness and pointedness only mean hitting the nail on the head, revealing the crux of the problem in one word, and analyzing it to its core. It is absolutely different from labels flying everywhere and "posing to intimidate people." Lu Xun said that abuse and intimidation are by no means a fight, and the meaning lies precisely here.

Speaking of combat, some overly cautious comrades become flustered again: "Is there still talk of combat within the people?" No, we are talking about fighting against the ideological dregs left over from feudalism and capitalism, not targeting a certain person or a certain group of people, please rest assured. As for dealing with those ideological dregs, I think there is no need to be so peaceful and balanced, nor so gentle, kind, respectful, thrifty, and yielding.

Literary work is ideological work, and it is necessarily directed at matters and not at people. Even if someone holds up the banner that literature is the "study of man," I only think that it is the study of the living soul, not the study of "revealing people's shortcomings to watch them laugh" (at least within the people). Therefore, even if essays sometimes cite some actual examples, it only serves to better clarify an idea and provoke deep thought, rather than making him unable to stand between heaven and earth.

    锋利，正是为了治病救人
    雁序
    读了“小品文的新危机”，平时积累下的一些骨鲠在喉的意见，实在有一吐为快的感觉。
    一个月前我参加上海一个报纸的座谈会，这个报纸的负责同志说，“杂文在争鸣时往往容易抓人家的‘小辫子’，专事挑剔别人的错误，所以带有很大的片面性。因此我们考虑争鸣时是不是不用杂文，即使用杂文，也得从求同出发，先大量的肯定别人的正确之处，然后再在不同意见处作一些补充。这样做既全面，也不伤人。”
    这些话引起了我的很多想法。我想，不伤人当然是好的，但是如果一定要先替别人来个“成绩是基本的”再来个“缺点是存在的”，大家都响应号召，以为只有这样才叫“不伤人”，那末，这倒真有点破题、承题、起承转合的八股味道了。回春同志说“药之为药”，“必须和平中正”，这固然是问题的一方面，但我则更同意另一先生的一个譬喻，他说，杂文应该像针灸医生手中的针，他看中“穴道”一刺，使人有点儿酸、有点儿痛，针的效果反映到大脑皮层，病就好了。
    其实，药毕竟不比糖茶，吃下去时总有些苦的，俗谚所谓“良药苦口利于病”，我们似乎也不必一闻到苦味就像三岁小孩子那样大哭大叫，大喊“要不得”。
    杂文是不是也可能产生一些副作用呢？有时自然也有，那就是某些作者思想上的片面性，而不是杂文本身的过错。如果因此而把一切杂文都废掉，或者把锋芒一律磨光，大家来个四平八稳，我看这只会助长官僚主义。
    有人一听到“锋利”、“尖锐”等字眼，立刻吓出一身冷汗来，立刻便把大帽子满天飞、恶毒的挖苦人等等与之联系起来。其实，我觉得尖锐、锋利只应该是深刻的思想内容的孪生兄弟，或者说前者是后者的形式和外壳。真正的锋利和尖锐只意味着一针见血，把问题的症结一语道破，分析到它的骨子里。它绝对不同于大帽子满天飞和“装腔作势，借以吓人”。鲁迅先生说过辱骂和恐吓决不是战斗，意义也正在这里。
    一提起战斗，某些稳重有余的同志便又慌了手脚：“人民内部还讲战斗吗？”不，我们讲的是向封建主义、资本主义遗留下来的思想渣滓作战斗，而不是针对某一个或某一群人民，请放心好了。至于对待那些思想渣滓，我想倒不必那么和平中正，也不必那么温良恭俭让的。
    文学工作是思想工作，它必然是对事不对人的。即使有人抬出文学是“人学”的牌子来，但我也只认为它是活人灵魂的人学，而不是“揭人之短看哈哈笑”的人学（至少对人民内部是如此）。所以杂文即使有时举出一些实际事例，也只服务于更好的阐明一种思想，引人深思，而不是使他无所立足于天地之间。
