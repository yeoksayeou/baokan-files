Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Jakarta: According to reports, Indonesian Prime Minister Juanda said in a nationwide broadcast on Indonesian Radio on the evening of the 11th that the immediate tasks of the new cabinet are: to restore order and security, to improve local autonomy, to carry out local construction, to improve the country's financial and economic situation, and to eradicate smuggling and corruption.

Juanda said that as the Prime Minister of the new cabinet, he will certainly implement and realize the platform of the new cabinet without hesitation. He believes that it is necessary to adopt special methods under martial law to organize such an extraordinary cabinet that is fully responsible for national administration. He said that, like previous cabinets, the current cabinet is still responsible to the parliament in the execution of its policies.

The "Social Messenger" newspaper of the Islamic Teachers Association published an editorial today saying that Prime Minister Juanda's broadcast speech was "worthy of sympathy" because he recognized the reality he faced and demonstrated "confidence in his work."

Since the formation of the Juanda cabinet, several major political parties and many mass organizations in Indonesia have expressed their attitudes.

Suwirjo, Chairman of the Nationalist Party, told reporters that he believed the new cabinet would be able to properly carry out its tasks because it had many new forces.

The Central Committee of the Islamic Teachers Association issued a statement on the 9th stating that the Islamic Teachers Association allows its members to join the cabinet, but this is a personal matter and should be the responsibility of the individual.

D.N. Aidit, General Secretary of the Indonesian Communist Party, said that the lineup of the new cabinet is simple and the platform is correct. He believes that if the new cabinet works hard, it will definitely be able to realize its platform.

The Central Committee of the Masyumi Party issued a statement on the evening of the 9th, asserting that the new cabinet could not solve the problems within the army and in the localities, and opposed its members joining the cabinet. Muhammad Noor, who accepted the appointment as Minister of Public Works and Power in the new cabinet, has been expelled from the party.

The Central Committee of the Indonesian Islamic Union Party also issued a statement on the 9th, expressing its disapproval of its members participating in the new cabinet. However, Sudibjo, the new Minister of Information in the cabinet who belongs to this party, also told reporters that only the head of state can now dismiss him from his position.

Arudji Kartawinata, Chairman of the Islamic Union Party, expressed his personal opinion that the platform of the new cabinet is good and actually no different from the platform of the previous cabinet. At the same time, he said that the organization of the new cabinet seems to have made realistic changes.

Tambunan, Vice Chairman of the Indonesian Christian Party, said that the participation of Leimena, Chairman of the Christian Party, in the cabinet was based on his own consideration and decision, and his party is likely to agree.

The Central Committee of the Common People's Party issued a statement on the 11th stating that the Common People's Party fully supports the implementation of the platform of the new cabinet. The statement also said that Sukarno's formation of the cabinet was "responsible."

The party also acknowledged that the newly appointed Minister of Education and Culture, Professor Prijono, is a member of the party and the chief representative of the Common People's Party in the Constitutional Assembly. The statement expressed approval of Prijono's entry into the cabinet.

The Central Organization of All Indonesian Trade Unions, with 2.6 million members, telegraphed President Sukarno on the 10th, expressing its support for his formation of an extra-parliamentary cabinet for emergency affairs.

In addition, mass organizations such as the Indonesian Women's Movement Association, the Democratic Women's Association, the Railway Workers Union, the Automobile Workers Union, and the Democratic Youth League have all sent telegrams expressing support for the Juanda cabinet.

Jakarta newspapers have also published commentaries on the formation of the new cabinet for several days.

The "Indonesia Torch" newspaper said that hope can be placed in the new cabinet. It said that the entry into the cabinet of Du Bin, Ying Jiliwang, Maenkum, Chalid, Nur, Hanafi, and Harul Saleh has enabled the new cabinet to obtain full support from the localities.

The aforementioned cabinet members are from Sumatra, Sulawesi, Kalimantan, and other islands, and are considered to be talented and impartial.

The Masyumi Party's "Eternal Daily" expressed disappointment with the formation of the new cabinet. The Indonesian Socialist Party's "Compass" newspaper's editorial believed that local problems would become the main difficulty for the new cabinet.
