    Spring of Friendship
    Yang Zhenya
    The climate in Japan this year is colder than usual. I heard that it snowed a few days before we arrived in Tokyo (March 23rd). But these days it has been sunny and warm, and the cherry blossoms in Tokyo's Ueno Park are already budding. A Japanese friend said, "The Chinese youth delegation has brought spring."
    On the 25th, we took a fast boat to visit Kasumigaura, the second largest lake in Japan, and enjoyed the beautiful scenery of mountains and clear waters. After that, we arrived at Itako Town in Ibaraki Prefecture. Young people from nearby counties and villages set off at four o'clock in the morning to come to the dock to welcome us. The middle and elementary schools in Itako Town had originally scheduled their graduation ceremonies for this day, but they were postponed in order to meet the Chinese youth. We participated in a welcome rally of more than 600 people. The grand chorus of "Tokyo-Beijing" rose and fell one after another. The young women from the "Youth Association Against the Kami-no-Ike Base" put their hand-sewn work clothes on each of us. During the meeting, postmen delivered telegrams of congratulations to us one after another.
    The Japanese youth's friendship towards us has caused the hosts to put great effort into arranging our itinerary. Many places sent representatives to Tokyo or called the Japan Youth Organizations Council to insist on inviting the delegation to visit. Thanks to the hosts' arrangements, we will be visiting 29 prefectures in Japan in one month, which means we have to travel to a prefecture almost every day!
    I met the Japanese youth representatives who visited our country last October. They said that Japanese youth have a kind of "China fever" and are interested in any issue related to New China. In Hiroshima, Mr. Komori Tatsukuni told me that after returning from China at the end of last year, he had already given visit reports to more than 30,000 young people in the prefecture, traveling throughout the towns and villages of Hiroshima Prefecture. "What are they most interested in?" I asked. He smiled and said, "That's hard to say. People are interested in everything from young people in their twenties becoming principals and village chiefs, to people welcoming criticism, love, and marriage... In short, everything!" He added, "The visit reports are still not finished!" We have made many new friends. Kishi Yoko, a graduate student at the University of Tokyo who is helping the delegation with translation this time, can not only speak fluent Chinese, but is also very knowledgeable about Chinese literature. She showed me a photo of her playing "Zhuo Wenjun" in a school play. Her lover also studies Chinese literature. She hopes to be able to travel to China for their honeymoon after they get married.
    On the 28th, we arrived in Fuchu City, Hiroshima Prefecture. Residents waved to us on both sides of the road. In the evening, more than 600 people gathered at the city's public hall, asking us to talk about the Chinese youth's attitude towards the issue of banning atomic and hydrogen weapons. Japanese youth also talked about their views. The opinions of the youth of the two countries were completely consistent. They were very grateful to the Chinese youth for supporting the Japanese youth and people's call for Britain to stop testing hydrogen bombs on Christmas Island. The next day, when we were having a discussion with atomic bomb victims in the mayor's office, the city council happened to pass a resolution demanding that Britain stop testing hydrogen bombs on Christmas Island. Mayor Soeto Nobuo said, "No force can hinder the development of Sino-Japanese friendship, and the youth and people of the two countries should unite to defend Asian and world peace."
    Our mood in Hiroshima was heavy. When the dome of a tall building destroyed by the atomic bomb caught my eye, I immediately felt pain in my heart. The war has been over for eleven years, but there are still tens of thousands of people here suffering from atomic disease and living an uneasy life. But Hiroshima has not been destroyed, it has stood up like a giant again. When overlooking the entire city of Hiroshima from the higher ground of Mt. Hiji Park, a young friend from Hiroshima proudly pointed to the avenue that was more than 100 meters wide and said, "This is Peace Boulevard!" Then he pointed to a river and said, "This is Peace River!" The youth and people of Hiroshima have put in hard work to build a peaceful life.
    On the 30th, we visited Okayama Prefecture. In Korakuen, one of the three major gardens in this prefecture, the pair of red-crowned cranes that Mr. Guo Moruo sent last year have grown even fuller, and the red on their heads is even more vibrant. A Japanese female poet who had visited China recited a poem in praise of the cranes at the welcome banquet:
    Across the shallow blue skies of Asia,
    You spread your white wings and fly,
    For the ancient friendship between two countries,
    People hear your melodious song echoing...
    The spring sunshine feels particularly warm, and the mountains and fields of Japan are already lush green. In these poetic and picturesque days, the youth of China and Japan are spending the spring of friendship together. (Attached photo)

### 友谊的春天

    友谊的春天
    杨振亚
    今年日本的气候比往年要冷一些，听说在我们到达东京（3月23日）的前几天还下了雪。但这几天却晴朗和暖，东京上野公园的樱花已含苞欲放了。一位日本朋友说：“中国青年代表团带来了春天。”
    25日，我们坐快速艇游览日本第二个大湖——霞之浦，饱赏了山明水秀的风光之后，我们来到了茨城县的潮来町。附近各郡和村的青年们，从夜里四点就动身赶到码头上来欢迎我们。潮来町的各中、小学校，原订在这天举行毕业典礼，但是为了会见中国青年而改期了。我们参加了六百多人的欢迎大会。“东京—北京”的大合唱一次又一次地此起彼伏。“神之池反对基地青年会”的女青年们，把她们亲手缝的工作服，穿在我们每个人的身上。在会议进行中，邮差把一封又一封的贺电送到我们手中。
    日本广大青年对我们的这种友情，使主人在安排日程上煞费心机。许多地方派代表来东京或打电话给日本青年团协议会，坚持邀请代表团去作客。感谢主人的安排，我们将在一个月的时间里，访问日本的二十九个县，就是说平均每天要跑一个县！
    我遇到了去年10月访问过我国的日本青年代表们。他们说，日本青年有一种“中国热”，对新中国什么问题都有兴趣。在广岛，小森龙邦先生告诉我，他去年年底从中国回来后，已经向全县三万多青年作了访问报告，走遍了广岛县的城镇和乡村。“他们最感兴趣的是什么问题呢？”我问。他笑了笑说：“这很难说。对二十几岁的青年能当校长、村长，人们欢迎别人批评，恋爱，结婚……总之，都有兴趣！”他又补充说：“访问报告到现在还没有作完呢！”我们结识了很多新的朋友。这次帮助代表团作翻译的东京大学研究生岸阳子，不仅能说一口流畅的中国话，而且对中国的文学也很有研究。她给我看了她在学校演戏时扮演“卓文君”的照片。她的爱人也是研究中国文学的。她希望在结婚后能一起到中国作新婚旅行。
    28日，我们来到了广岛县的府中市。居民们在马路两旁向我们招手。晚上，在市公民馆有六百多人集会，要求我们谈谈中国青年对禁止原子武器和氢武器问题的态度。日本青年也谈了他们的看法。两国青年的意见完全一致。他们非常感激中国青年支持日本青年和人民要求英国停止在圣诞岛试验氢弹的呼声。第二天，当我们在市长办公室同原子弹受害者座谈时，市议会恰好通过了要求英国停止在圣诞岛试验氢弹的决议。市长宗藤信夫说：“任何力量也不能阻碍中日友好的发展，两国青年和人民应该团结起来，保卫亚洲和世界和平”。
    我们在广岛时的心情是沉重的。一幢被原子弹毁坏了的高楼的圆房顶触进眼帘时，我的心中立即感到痛楚。战争已经过去十一年了，但这里还有数万人患有原子病，过着不安的日子。但是广岛没有毁灭，它又像巨人一样地站起来了。在比冶山公园高处眺望广岛全市时，广岛青年朋友骄傲地指着有一百多公尺宽的大道说：“这是和平大道！”又指着一条河说：“这是和平河！”。广岛青年和人民为建设和平生活付出了辛勤的劳动。
    30日，我们到冈山县作客。在这个县的日本三大公园之一的后乐园里，郭沫若先生去年送来的一对丹顶鹤已经长得更丰满了，顶上的红色也更鲜艳了。一位访问过中国的日本女诗人，在欢迎宴会上朗诵了对仙鹤的赞美诗：
    划过亚洲浅蓝的高空，
    你展开白翅在飞翔，
    为了两个国家的古老友谊，
    人们听见你鸣声荡漾……
    春天的阳光显得特别温暖，日本的山野已是一片葱绿。在充满诗情画意的日子里，中日两国青年共度着友谊的春天。（附图片）
