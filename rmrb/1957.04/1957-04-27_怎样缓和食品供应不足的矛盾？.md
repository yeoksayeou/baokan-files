How to Ease the Contradiction of Insufficient Food Supply?
Commentator of this newspaper

    Various sectors of the food industry are encountering difficulties due to insufficient raw material supply to varying degrees; food industry products such as oils, sugar, dairy products, alcohol, canned goods, and egg products are all experiencing tight supply and demand. To ease the contradiction of insufficient food supply, in addition to hoping that consumers appropriately restrain their consumption, the staff and workers of the food industry sector should strive to overcome the difficulty of insufficient raw material supply and try to increase production as much as possible. This is the primary task of the food industry at present.
    Some comrades in the food industry department believe that "even a skilled cook cannot cook without rice." They think the potential for the food industry to save raw materials has been exhausted, and to increase production, they can only rely on the higher authorities to provide raw materials. Obviously, this idea is incorrect. Due to the insufficient supply of raw materials, it is certainly difficult for the food industry to increase production, but many facts prove that as long as leaders at all levels are proactive, fully rely on the broad masses of workers, and take all effective measures to obtain raw materials, save raw materials, and fully and rationally utilize raw materials, then the difficulty of insufficient raw material supply can be overcome to varying degrees.
    How to obtain and utilize all possible raw materials? Under the premise of ensuring the implementation of the state's unified purchase and sales and price policies, and with the close cooperation of raw material supply departments, supply and marketing cooperatives, and agricultural cooperatives, the food industry can obtain and utilize many scattered, small-scale raw materials. In 1956, the food industry in Liaoning Province purchased various small oilseeds from farmers, increasing oil production by more than 1,300 tons; it also utilized various wild fruits and agricultural and sideline products to increase white wine production by more than 2,900 tons. This year, seven oil factories in Xinxiang Prefecture, Henan Province, used the method of "exchanging oil cakes for oilseeds" to process more than 13 million jin of self-retained oilseeds for agricultural cooperatives, thus easing the tension in raw material supply and increasing production.
    The food industry should pay full attention to utilizing raw materials that have not yet been utilized. According to survey and experimental results, there are more than 70 kinds of wild oilseeds that can be used for oil extraction. If they are fully utilized, they can increase oil production by a lot each year. Among the oilseeds retained by farmers nationwide, more than 1 million tons of soybeans are directly used as feed. If 20% of these soybeans can be used for oil extraction first and then as feed, oil production can be increased by more than 20,000 tons.
    Some raw materials in the food industry are not utilized due to limitations in production, storage, and transportation equipment. For example, in Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, and the Northwest, there is a lot of milk that is not utilized. In Ang'angxi, Heilongjiang alone, 10 tons of fresh milk are not utilized every day. If a dozen more trucks can be added in the Inner Mongolia area to transport milk, more than 2,000 tons of milk can be purchased this year, increasing milk powder production by 250 tons.
    Finding substitute raw materials is also a major aspect of the food industry's efforts to obtain and save raw materials. About 80,000 tons of edible oil are used as raw materials for soap nationwide. Oil foots, rice bran oil, silkworm pupa oil, and fish oil should be actively used to replace edible oil as soap raw materials. More than 20% of the raw materials for alcohol nationwide are food grains. If potatoes are fully utilized as raw materials for alcohol, a large amount of food grains can be saved.
    The food industry must also take various measures to comprehensively utilize raw materials. Currently, 90% of the cottonseed used for oil extraction has not been delinted, and on the other hand, oil factories with delinting equipment do not have sufficient cottonseed. Therefore, it is necessary to rationally allocate raw materials based on the economic value of comprehensive utilization of raw materials. Some soap factories nationwide do not extract glycerin from soap waste liquid. If simple equipment for extracting glycerin is added to these soap factories, hundreds of tons of glycerin can be recovered this year. The distiller's grains of some alcohol factories have not been well utilized. The Jinan Huangtai Distiller's Grains Processing Station has adopted the method of drying distiller's grains in brick pools, so that the distiller's grains can be used as feed, which is very popular among farmers. In the past, the distiller's grains of the Beijing Winery could not be used as feed due to the addition of rice husks, and the accumulated distiller's grains often could not be disposed of. In March of this year, they learned from the experience of the Changping County Winery and used peanut shells instead of rice husks, and the distiller's grains became good feed and were in short supply. The fruit peels and cores of canneries have great potential for comprehensive utilization. According to the experience of the Chongqing Cannery, in addition to canning the tangerine segments of citrus fruits, they also produce tangerine peel oil, tangerine kernel oil, and tangerine albedo. In addition, eggshells from egg product factories, protein after removing butter from dairy products, etc., can all be comprehensively utilized.
    The raw material utilization rate of various sectors of the food industry varies greatly between advanced units and ordinary units. For example, in Hunan Province's native oil presses, the highest oil yield of camellia oil is 27%, the general is 24%, and the lowest is only 18%, especially the newly developed native oil presses at the end of last year. The native oil press volume accounts for more than 60% of all oilseeds supplied for pressing nationwide. If technical management is strengthened and advanced experience is vigorously promoted, and the oil yield is increased by an average of 1%, then oil production can be increased by 50,000 tons this year. In the brewing industry, the starch-to-alcohol conversion rate not only varies from enterprise to enterprise, but also varies greatly between seasons within an enterprise. The highest glycerin recovery rate of soap waste liquid has reached more than 92%, but it is generally still around 80%. For 10,000 cases of Qianmen brand cigarettes of the same quality and quantity, the Tianjin Cigarette Factory consumes an average of 1,000 kilograms more tobacco leaves than the Shanghai Cigarette Factory. To manufacture 100 tons of original-juice pork canned goods, Shanghai Food Factory No. 1 consumes three tons more pork than Food Factory No. 2. Therefore, vigorously promoting advanced experience to enable the backward to catch up with the advanced can improve the yield, which can not only save raw materials but also increase production.
    Increasing new varieties according to social needs is also an important aspect of the food industry's efforts to save raw materials, fully utilize raw materials, and increase production. From the perspective of the product varieties of the food industry, the current situation is far from meeting the needs of the people. For example, the concentration of beer and fruit wine in the past was generally high. If some 10-degree beer is produced, the output can be increased without increasing raw materials; the output of popular wine can also be greatly increased. In addition, in the canning industry, fully utilizing various different varieties of fruits, vegetables, aquatic products, and other raw materials to increase new varieties can not only obtain and utilize more raw materials, but also better meet social needs.
    Stabilizing and improving product quality, and overcoming the waste of raw materials, are tasks that food industry enterprises must continue to work hard to do well. The greatest waste of raw materials is the large number of defective and substandard products. For example, in 1956, state-owned cigarette factories had more than 13,500 cases of defective products, among which the state-owned Harbin Cigarette Factory had a defective rate of more than 4% at its peak. This has caused a large amount of raw material waste. Last year's quality accidents with Qingdao Cigarette Factory's Yellow River brand cigarettes and Shanghai Food Factory No. 1's meat and green bean canned goods also caused great losses. Therefore, while saving raw materials and striving to increase production, we must ensure product quality; otherwise, it will cause even greater waste.
    The above points all illustrate that it is possible for the food industry to overcome the difficulties of insufficient raw material supply and strive to increase production; but turning possibility into reality is not an easy task. Leaders at all levels in the food industry need to have the drive to overcome difficulties by all means, need to fully mobilize the masses of employees to deeply carry out the advanced producer movement, need to strengthen investigation and research, improve technology, organize coordination and cooperation, and combine these tasks well. In particular, more than 70% of the raw materials for food industry products come from agricultural products. Therefore, we must rely on party and government leading organs at all levels to strengthen the leadership of the raw material supply work of the food industry; require the industrial, agricultural, and commercial sectors to work together, cooperate closely, and support each other; only in this way can we turn possibility into reality.

    怎样缓和食品供应不足的矛盾？
    本报评论员
    食品工业的各个行业，都程度不同地遇到原料供应不足的困难；食品工业产品，如油脂、糖、乳制品、酒精、罐头、蛋品等，都呈现供不应求的紧张情况。为了缓和食品供应不足的矛盾，除了希望消费者适当约束消费量以外，食品工业部门的职工，应当努力克服原料供应不足的困难，尽量增加生产。这是食品工业当前的首要任务。
    食品工业部门有些同志认为：“巧妇难为无米炊”，食品工业节约原料的潜力已经挖尽了，要增产只有上级给原料。很显然，这种想法是不对的。由于原料供应不足，食品工业要增产，困难固然很大，但许多事实证明，只要各级领导同志积极主动起来，充分依靠广大职工，千方百计地采取各种有效措施，争取原料，节约原料，充分合理利用原料，那末，原料供应不足的困难在不同的程度上是可以克服的。
    怎样争取、利用一切可以争取可以利用的原料呢？在保证执行国家的统购统销和价格政策的条件下，取得原料供应部门、供销合作社、农业合作社等的密切配合协作，食品工业是可以争取和利用许多分散的、小宗的原料的。1956年辽宁省的食品工业就从农民手中收购了各种小宗油料，增产油脂一千三百多吨；利用各种野生果实，和农副业产品，增产白酒二千九百多吨。今年河南新乡专区七个油厂，用“以油饼换油料”的办法，为农业社加工自留油料一千三百多万斤，因而缓和了原料的紧张情况，增加了生产。
    食品工业对于还没有利用的原料应该充分注意利用。根据调查试验的结果，可以利用来榨油的野生油料就有七十多种，如果把它们充分利用起来，一年就能够增产很多油脂。全国农民自留油料中，有一百多万吨大豆直接用作饲料，如果争取利用这些大豆的20％来先榨油后作饲料，就可以增产油脂二万多吨。
    食品工业的原料，有一些受到生产、储运设备的限制而没有利用，如内蒙古、黑龙江、西北等地，就有许多牛奶没有利用。仅黑龙江的昂昂溪，每天就有十吨鲜奶未被利用。如果在内蒙古地区设法增加十几辆汽车来运牛奶，今年就可以争取多收购二千吨牛奶，增产二百五十吨奶粉。
    寻找代用原料，也是食品工业争取和节约原料的一个主要方面。全国肥皂的原料，约有八万吨是食用油，应该积极利用油脚、米糠油、蚕蛹油和鱼油来代替食油作肥皂原料。全国酒精的原料，约有20％以上是粮谷，如果充分利用薯类作酒精原料，就可以节省大量粮谷。
    食品工业还必须采取各种措施，综合利用原料。目前榨油用的棉子一方面有90％没有脱绒，另一方面有脱绒设备的油厂，却没有充足的棉子。因此，根据原料综合利用的经济价值，合理调配原料，是非常必要的。全国有一部分肥皂工厂没有提取肥皂废液中的甘油，如果在这些肥皂工厂中添设提取甘油的简易设备，今年就可以回收数百吨甘油。若干酒精厂的酒糟还没有得到很好的利用。济南黄台酒糟加工站采取砖池干固酒糟的办法，使酒糟可以作为饲料，很受农民的欢迎。北京酿酒厂的酒糟，过去因掺有稻壳不能作为饲料，积压的酒糟往往无法处理，今年3月他们学习了昌平县酒厂的经验，用花生壳代替稻壳，酒糟便成为良好的饲料而供不应求了。罐头厂的果皮、果心等物，综合利用的潜力很大。根据重庆市罐头厂的经验，他们除将柑桔的桔瓣作罐头外，还产桔皮油、桔核油和桔络。此外，蛋品厂的蛋壳，乳品脱黄油后的蛋白质等，都可以综合利用。
    食品工业各行业的原料利用率，先进单位和普通单位之间高低悬殊很大。如湖南省的土榨油坊，茶油的最高出油率是27％，一般为24％，最低的只有18％，特别是去年年底新发展的土榨油坊更低。全国土榨榨量占全部供榨油料的60％以上，如果加强技术管理，大力推广先进经验，平均提高出油率1％，那末今年就可以增产五万吨油。在酿酒工业中的淀粉出酒率，不仅企业间高低不一，就是在一个企业内，各季之间也是相差很大的。肥皂废液的甘油回收率最高的已达到92％以上，但一般尚在80％左右。一万箱同质同量的前门牌卷烟，天津卷烟厂比上海卷烟厂平均多耗用烟叶一千公斤。制造一百吨原汁猪肉罐头，上海食品一厂比食品二厂多耗用三吨猪肉。因此，大力推广先进经验，使落后的赶上先进的，那末，收得率就能够提高，不但可以节约原料，而且可以增加生产。
    根据社会需要，增加新的品种，也是食品工业节约原料、充分利用原料、增加生产的一个重要方面。从食品工业的产品品种来看，目前远远没有赶上人民的需要。如啤酒和果酒，过去的品种一般浓度都较高，如果生产一部分十度的啤酒，原料不增加，就可以增加产量；生产大众化的葡萄酒，产量也可以大大增加。此外，在罐头工业中，充分利用各种不同品种的水果、蔬菜、水产等原料，增加新的品种，既可以争取利用更多的原料，同时又可以更好地满足社会需要。
    稳定和提高产品质量，克服原料的浪费，更是食品工业企业必须继续努力作好的工作。原料最大的浪费是废品多、次品多。如1956年国营卷烟厂废品达一万三千五百多箱，其中国营哈尔滨卷烟厂，废品率最高时竟达4％以上。这样就造成大批原料的浪费。去年青岛卷烟厂的黄河牌卷烟和上海食品一厂的肉类与青豆罐头发生质量事故，也造成很大损失。因此，在节约原料，努力增产的同时，必须保证产品质量，否则，将会造成更大的浪费。
    上述种种都说明了食品工业要克服原料供应不足的困难，努力增加生产，是可能的；但要把可能变为现实，并不是轻而易举的事情。食品工业的各级领导者们，需要具有千方百计克服困难的劲头，需要充分发动职工群众深入开展先进生产者运动；需要加强调查研究，改进技术，组织配合协作，并把这些工作很好地结合起来；特别是食品工业产品的原料，70％以上来自农产品，因此，必须依靠各级地方党政领导机关，加强对食品工业原料供应工作的领导；要求工业、农业、商业各部门，共同努力，密切合作，互相支援；这样，才会把可能变为现实。
