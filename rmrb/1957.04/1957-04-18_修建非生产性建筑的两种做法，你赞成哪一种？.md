Which of the two approaches to building non-productive buildings do you support?
	Is it to be simple and crude, meeting the needs of more people?
	Or is it to be luxurious and magnificent, only for the enjoyment of a few?
	Is it to rely on the masses to strive to solve more problems?
	Or is it to wait passively, relying solely on state investment?

This newspaper reports that, in the context of rapid urban population growth and limited state investment, how can service industries be developed to appropriately meet the needs of the people's lives? After several years of exploration, Lanzhou has gradually clarified the direction: it is to face the masses and rely on the masses to solve this major problem.

From the second half of 1955 to now, Lanzhou has newly built and renovated five theaters and one cinema. The construction costs of these cinemas and theaters come from four sources: local self-raising, mass fundraising, self-raising by private professional theater troupes, and joint fundraising by relevant departments. The construction costs of these theaters and cinemas ranged from a maximum of 140,000 yuan to a minimum of only 20,000 yuan.

The urban population of Lanzhou increased by nearly 220,000 from January 1956 to March 1957, which is half of the total population of the city before 1956. The new urban area is sixty kilometers long from east to west, and Donggang, Qilihe, Xigu, and Agan Town have all taken initial shape. The three characteristics of rapid development, poor infrastructure, and a narrow and long urban area have increased the difficulties of urban people's lives. Before the second half of 1955, there were only eight theaters and cinemas in the city, with more than 6,400 seats, all concentrated in the old city. The Xigu district, with a population of more than 80,000, is 20 kilometers away from the city. Every holiday, workers go to the city to watch operas and movies, taking buses and trains, plus the waiting time, often taking three or four hours. This situation not only prevents workers from getting a good rest on holidays, but also costs a lot of money, with transportation costs alone amounting to around eight jiao. However, even after finally squeezing into the city, it is not always possible to buy tickets, and the workers have many complaints. How to solve this problem? The Municipal Bureau of Culture had taken some measures, sending film projection teams and small theater troupes to the new urban areas to perform in collective canteens and squares. However, each performance was extremely crowded, the order was chaotic, and everyone could not see well. This method obviously cannot solve the problem, so we must find other ways to build simple theaters with very little money to meet the needs of the masses. However, a certain mindset has firmly restricted some comrades. They believe that in a new, modern big city, whatever is built must "look the part," must have certain standards; construction should be carried out according to the planned urban long-term plan; especially buildings like entertainment venues should be located in the central area, and if they are not built, so be it, but if they are built, they must be permanent high-rise buildings. When the Municipal Bureau of Culture proposed last year to build a simple theater in the Xigu district using locally raised funds, it was opposed.

Faced with the urgent needs of the broad masses, should we do as much as possible with the conditions currently available, solving as many problems as possible? Or should we pursue "modernization" and "permanence" in high-rise theaters, yet lack the funds, leaving the masses waiting in vain? The Municipal Party Committee weighed these issues and finally approved the opinion of the Municipal Bureau of Culture, deciding to build a simple theater in the industrial area.

After the theater started construction, it received the active support of the local people. Many pieces of wood, bricks, and tiles were taken from old houses that had been demolished. This theater has 1,024 seats (more than the People's Theater, which cost more than 700,000 yuan to build), and also has 20 bungalows that can be used to accommodate visiting theater troupes. The total construction area is 1,547 square meters, costing 37,475 yuan for materials and 20,457 yuan for labor, with an average cost of only 37 yuan per square meter. The masses are satisfied with the completion of this theater.

In the two years, among the theaters built in Lanzhou, one was built by mass fundraising (the joint state-private DaZhong Enterprise Company), one was built by the theater troupe itself, and two were built by joint fundraising from various relevant departments. These four theaters, plus the Xigu Theater, added more than 4,660 seats. In addition, a cinema (with 800 seats) was built with local investment. Among them, it is worth mentioning the theater built by the Xinsheng Qin Opera Troupe with the help of the government. They initially had only 10,000 yuan in funds. The entire troupe, on the one hand, saved expenses, and on the other hand, went to various counties to tour, increasing accumulation. The government helped them borrow 16,000 yuan from various theater troupes with surpluses. Last year, the government allocated them 1,500 yuan from the funds for relief to folk artists, which they also used entirely for construction costs. Through their diligent management, they finally built a spacious and bright theater with brick pillars and adobe walls. After its completion in November last year, they were able to perform throughout the winter, the attendance rate was very high, and income increased. In just over four months, they had paid off all the loans.

Of course, for a city that has suddenly increased by hundreds of thousands of people, five or six theaters and cinemas cannot solve all the problems; at the same time, because the original cinemas and theaters are all concentrated in the old city, the distribution is not balanced enough. However, from the development of these two years, it can be clearly seen that Lanzhou has a new trend in solving the problems of the people's lives: establishing cultural and entertainment venues with very low construction costs and simple architecture in new industrial areas, using various methods to tap the potential of local areas and the masses, and running things that the masses urgently need. This new trend in Lanzhou is not only reflected in the construction of theaters and cinemas, but has also begun to expand to the establishment of simple shopping malls, worker dormitories, bathhouses, and small restaurants with lower standards but suitable for use. This is a pragmatic road that serves the people. (Attached picture)

### 修建非生产性建筑的两种做法，你赞成哪一种？

    修建非生产性建筑的两种做法，你赞成哪一种？
    是因陋就简，满足更多人的需要？
    还是富丽堂皇，只够少数人享用？
    是依靠群众，争取解决更多的问题？
    还是消极等待，单纯依赖国家投资？
    本报讯　在城市人口急增、国家投资有限的情况下，怎样发展服务性的行业，适当满足人民生活的需要呢？兰州市经过几年的摸索，逐渐明确了方向：就是要面向群众、依靠群众，来解决这个大问题。
    从1955年下半年到现在，兰州市新建和改建剧院五座，影院一座。这些影院剧场的修建费，来自地方自筹、群众集资、民间职业剧团自筹和有关部门联合集资的四个方面。这些剧院和影院的建筑费，最高的十四万元，最低的只用了两万元。
    兰州市的城市人口从1956年1月到1957年3月，增加了近二十二万，为1956年以前全市人口总数的一半。新的市区东西长达六十公里，东岗、七里河、西固、阿干镇，都已粗具规模。发展快、基础差、市区狭长的三个特点，增加了城市人民生活的困难。1955年下半年以前，全市只有剧院影院八座，六千四百多个座位，还都集中在旧城里。八万多人的西固区，距城二十公里，每逢假日，职工进城看戏看电影，乘坐公共汽车、火车，加上等车的时间，往往需要三、四个钟点。这种情况，不但使职工们假日不能得到很好的休息，并且要花不少的钱，光是车费，就在八角上下。但是，好容易挤进了城，还不一定能买到票，职工群众的意见很多。怎样解决这个问题呢？市文化局曾经采取过一些办法，派出放映队，小型剧团到新的市区，利用集体食堂和广场演出。但是每次演出，观众十分拥挤，秩序乱，大家都看不好。这种办法，显然不能解决问题，这就必须找出别的办法，花很少的钱修筑简易剧场来满足群众的需要。然而，有一种思想却牢牢地束缚了某些同志。他们认为，在新的现代化的大城市里，要建设什么，就得“像个样子”，要有一定的标准；要根据编制的城市远景规划，进行近期建设；尤其像娱乐场所一类的建筑，都是放在中心地区，不建则已，要建就得建永久性的高楼大厦。当去年文化局提出在西固区用地方自筹经费的办法，修筑一座简易建筑的剧场的时候，就遭到反对。
      面对着广大群众迫切的需要，是就目前可能的条件，能解决多大问题就办多大事呢？还是为了追求“现代化”“永久性”的高层剧院，又没有资金，让群众干等着呢？市委衡量了这些问题，最后，批准市文化局的意见，确定在工业区修建简易剧院。
    这个剧院动工以后，得到当地群众的积极支持，不少木料、砖瓦，是从旧房屋拆下来的。这个剧院，有一千零二十四个座位（比花了七十多万元修建的人民剧院多十几个座位），还有二十间平房，可以供给外来剧团住宿。全部建筑面积是一千五百四十七平方公尺，用料三万七千四百七十五元，用工二万零四百五十七元，平均每平方公尺造价只有三十七元。群众对这个剧院的建成是满意的。
    两年间，兰州修建的剧院中，还有一个是由群众集资（公私合营大众企业公司）修建的，一个由剧团自筹资金修建的，两个由各有关部门联合集资修建的。这四个剧院，加上西固剧院，增加了四千六百六十多个座位。另外，还由地方投资修建了一个电影院（八百个座位）。其中，值得特别提到的，是新声秦剧团在政府帮助下自建的剧院。他们起初只有一万元资金，全团一方面节省开支，一方面到外县去巡回演出，增加积累。政府帮助他们向有盈余的各个剧团借了一万六千元。去年政府在救济民间艺人的款项里，又拨给他们一千五百元，他们也全部挪作建筑费用。经过他们的勤俭经营，终于建设起一座砖柱土坯墙宽敞光亮的剧院。去年11月完工以后，整个冬季都能演出，上座率很高，收入增加，不过四个多月，他们已经还清了全部借款。
    当然，对于一个骤然增加几十万人口的城市来说，五、六个剧院和影院，并不能解决全部问题；同时，由于原有影院、剧院都集中在旧城里，分布也不够平衡。但是，从这两年的发展里，可以清楚地看出兰州市在解决群众生活问题上的一个新趋势：把造价很低、建筑简易的文化娱乐场所建立到新的工业区去，用多种多样的方法，发掘地方和群众的潜力，兴办群众所迫切需要的事。这一个新的趋势，在兰州，不只是表现在剧院和电影院的建筑上，还开始扩大到建立简易的商场，标准较低而适用的职工宿舍、浴池、小饭馆等方面。这是一条实事求是的、为人民群众服务的道路。（附图片）
