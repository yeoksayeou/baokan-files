Xinhua News Agency, April 12th: “Calculating fabric requirements for customers’ clothing, not wasting an inch of cloth,” has become an effective method for shop assistants in dozens of cotton fabric stores in Beijing to save cotton fabric for the country.

A few days ago, in the Huada Silk and Cloth Store on Wangfujing Street, a female customer wanted to buy nine chi (Chinese feet) of khaki cloth to make a uniform. The shop assistant, Chen Ziheng, noticed that she was not very tall and felt that so much cloth was unnecessary. He came out from behind the counter to advise her to have her measurements taken. As a result, even accounting for shrinkage and seam allowances, only seven chi and eight cun (Chinese inches) were needed. Seeing that she was still skeptical, Chen Ziheng explained the cutting method in detail. The female customer then bought the cloth and left satisfied. The shop assistants in this store, based on their daily contact with customers, have found that many customers are always afraid that they won't have enough material to make clothes, and that it will be troublesome to match fabrics, so they always buy more. Therefore, they proactively ask customers about the purpose of buying fabric, assess the customer's figure, and help them calculate meticulously.

In the larger state-owned Xidan Cotton Fabric Retail Store, most of the shop assistants have learned clothing cutting and drafting techniques, and can generally calculate the fabric requirements for clothing quickly and accurately for customers. In order to save customers time, they have also developed fixed sizes for ten types of clothing, such as Zhongshan suits and shirts, based on the height and build of customers.

    售货员量体卖布
    据新华社12日讯　“代顾客计算服装用料，不浪费一寸布”，这已经成为北京市几十家棉布店售货员为国家节省棉布的一种有效方法。
    几天前，在王府井华大绸布店，一个女顾客要买九尺卡叽布做制服，售货员陈子衡看她身材并不高，觉得用不了这么多的布，就走出柜台劝她量量身材，结果连缩水、缝边都算进去只要七尺八寸就够了。陈子衡看她还有怀疑，又详细解释了剪裁方法，这位女顾客才买好布满意地走了。这个商店的售货员根据每天和顾客的接触，发现不少顾客做衣服总怕料子不够，配起来麻烦，每次都要多买些。因此他们就主动地询问顾客买布用途，打量顾客身材，帮助算细账。
    规模较大的国营西单棉布零售店，大部分售货员都学会了服装的剪裁、绘图技术，一般都能迅速准确地代顾客计算好服装用料。为了节省顾客时间，他们还根据顾客身材的高低、肥瘦，研究出中山服、衬衫等十种服装的定型尺寸。
