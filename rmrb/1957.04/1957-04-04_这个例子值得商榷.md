This Example is Worth Discussing

The People's Daily editorial on March 4th, "Actively Participate in Social Savings," cited an example: a common worker's family in the Xi'an Textile Factory, who, despite difficult living conditions, can actively participate in savings. For a family of five with a monthly income of 54 yuan, being able to save each month is indeed commendable for their frugality. However, using such an example to universally mobilize families in similar situations to participate in social savings is worth discussing.

Let's briefly analyze this example. In this family, monthly food expenses account for 55.6% of income, rent accounts for 7.3%, oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, and coal account for 10.7%, vegetables account for 7%, stationery and newspapers for children and family entertainment expenses account for 10.2%, mutual aid fund accounts for 3.7%, and miscellaneous expenses account for 5.5%. Among these, the mutual aid fund expenditure accounts for more than half of the non-staple food expenses (Editor's Note: This refers only to the vegetable expenses); the entertainment expenditure exceeds the non-staple food expenditure by a significant amount (Editor's Note: If you add the oil, salt, soy sauce, etc., the entertainment expenditure does not exceed it), which seems unreasonable in typical family expenditures. Furthermore, calculating that each person in this family has only slightly more than one fen (cent) for non-staple food per meal (Editor's Note: With oil, salt, soy sauce, etc., each person's non-staple food per meal is actually more than one fen), seems too little. Using this as an example in an editorial is likely to cause unnecessary misunderstandings. In our country, we do not advocate that people lower their living standards and tighten their belts to actively participate in savings.

    这个例子值得商榷
    3月4日人民日报社论“积极参加社会储蓄”一文中所举的一个例子：西安纺织厂一个普通工人的家庭，在生活艰苦的情况下能够积极参加储蓄。像这样一个每月收入五十四元要维持五口人的家庭，每月还能参加储蓄，这种节约俭朴的精神确是难能可贵。但是用这样一个实例普遍动员类似情况的家庭参加社会储蓄，这就值得商榷了。
    把这个实例简单分析一下，在这个家庭里，粮食每月开支占收入的55.6％，房租占7.3％，油盐酱醋和煤炭占10.7％，菜蔬占7％，小孩用的文具、书报和全家娱乐费占10.2％，互助金占3.7％，零星开支占5.5％，其中互助金开支占副食品（编者按：这里指的仅是菜蔬一项开支）开支一半以上；文娱开支又超过副食品开支很多（编者按：如果加上油盐酱醋等副食开支，文娱开支并没有超过），在一般通常家庭开支中，好像不合情理。再算一下：在这个家庭里，每人每顿饭的副食品只有一分多一点钱（编者按：加上油盐酱醋，实际上每人每顿饭的副食不止一分多钱），似乎太少了，作为一个实例在社论中介绍，容易引起人们不必要的误解。在我们国家里，我们并没有提倡人们要降低生活水平，紧缩裤带去积极参加储蓄。
