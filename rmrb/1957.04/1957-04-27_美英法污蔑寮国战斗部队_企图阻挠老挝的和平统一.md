    US, UK, and France Smear the Lao Fighting Units
    Attempting to Obstruct Laos' Peaceful Reunification
    (Xinhua News Agency dispatch) The governments of the United States, Britain, and France announced a statement on April 24 expressing their policies towards Laos. This statement, which interferes in Laos' internal affairs, aims to obstruct Laos' peaceful reunification.
    On April 16, the three Western governments had already delivered notes with the same content to the Lao embassy in Washington, Paris, and London, respectively. In its note, the U.S. government recklessly attacked the Lao Fighting Units, insisting that the Lao Fighting Units "disregard" the Geneva Accords and the resolutions of the International Commission, and "add irrelevant conditions" to the Lao unification issue, thereby preventing the issue from being resolved. The U.S. government wants the Lao Royal Government to "maintain its determination," namely: "The political future of the Kingdom of Laos must not be decided by an opposition group that does not enjoy constitutional status."
    As early as last year, the Lao Royal Government and the Lao Fighting Units had already reached agreements on some important issues, including the establishment of a coalition government with representatives from the Lao Fighting Units participating, and the implementation of a policy of peace and neutrality. Currently, the two sides in Laos are negotiating how to specifically implement these agreements. However, some difficulties have been encountered in the negotiations.
    According to the "Nation" weekly published in New York on March 30 this year, the United States has been obstructing cooperation between the two sides in Laos, and has been "hinting" that the entire agreement on the establishment of a Lao coalition government on December 28 last year should be cancelled.

    美英法污蔑寮国战斗部队
    企图阻挠老挝的和平统一
    据新华社讯　美英法三国政府4月24日宣布了表明它们对老挝政策的声明，这份干涉老挝内政的声明的目的是企图阻挠老挝的和平统一。
    西方三国政府已经在4月16日分别在华盛顿、巴黎和伦敦把同样内容的照会交给老挝使馆。美国政府在它的照会中滥肆抨击寮国战斗部队，硬说寮国战斗部队“不顾”日内瓦协议和国际委员会的决议，对老挝统一问题“加上不相干的条件”，而使这个问题未能解决。美国政府要老挝王国政府“继续保持它的决心”，即：“老挝王国的政治前途不得由不享有宪法地位的反对派集团决定”。
    早在去年，老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队之间就已经在一些重要问题上达成协议，其中包括成立有寮国战斗部队代表参加的联合政府，执行和平中立政策等。目前，老挝双方正在谈判如何具体实现这些协议。不过，在谈判中遇到了一些困难。
    据今年3月30日纽约出版的“民族”周刊透露，美国一直在阻挠老挝双方合作，一直在“暗示”应该把去年12月28日有关成立老挝联合政府的整个协议取消。
