    Jilin Determines Policy for Constructing Mountainous and Semi-Mountainous Areas
    (By our correspondent) The Jilin Province convened a mountain area work conference to study the strengthening of leadership in mountain area work and the policy of comprehensively developing mountain area production.
    The mountainous and semi-mountainous areas of Jilin Province account for 64% of the province's total land area and 52% of the population. The mountain area economy is very rich and diverse, and the production and lives of the people in the mountain areas have also undergone great changes in recent years. However, in some places, insufficient attention has been paid to developing diversified economies in the mountain areas, which has affected the comprehensive development of mountain area production.
    In order to overcome these shortcomings, the conference determined the policies and tasks for constructing mountainous and semi-mountainous areas. In mountainous areas, forestry should be the main focus, combined with the development of agriculture, animal husbandry, local specialties, and other production; in semi-mountainous areas, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, local specialties, and other diversified economies should be developed in a comprehensive manner; in the hilly and plain areas within mountainous and semi-mountainous regions, agricultural production should be the main focus, with the conditional development of other various economies.
    The conference requested that the entire province complete mountain area production planning work in the spring of 1958, and carry out mountain area economic construction in a planned way according to the plan.

    吉林确定建设山区和半山区的方针
    本报讯　吉林省召开了山区工作会议，研究了加强山区工作的领导和全面发展山区生产的方针。
    吉林省的山区和半山区的土地面积占全省的64％，人口占52％。山区经济非常丰富多采，山区人民的生产和生活几年来也有很大的变化。但是，有些地方因为对开展山区多种经济注意不够，影响了山区生产的全面发展。
    为克服这些缺点，会议确定了建设山区和半山区的方针和任务。在山区应以林业为主，结合发展农业、畜牧业、土特产等生产；在半山区，综合发展农业、林业、畜牧业和土特产等多种经济；在山区和半山区中的丘陵区、平原区，则应以农业生产为主，有条件地发展其它各种经济。
    会议要求全省在1958年春天完成山区生产规划工作，按照规划有计划地进行山区经济建设。
