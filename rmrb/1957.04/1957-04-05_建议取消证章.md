    Suggestion to Abolish Badges
    Comrade Editor: If you browse the newspapers from various places, paying attention to the advertisement columns, you will be secretly surprised: how many people have lost their badges! In the advertisement column of Shandong's "Dazhong Daily", in one month of January this year, 263 people declared the loss of their badges, including 236 student school badges. This issue should attract our attention. Here, I propose the abolition of badges, for the following reasons:
    1. I think the meaning of wearing badges is twofold: to mark the identity of the wearer and the work or study unit they belong to; to facilitate security personnel to identify whether they are people from the unit. However, badges cannot be guaranteed not to be lost. If a lost badge is picked up by a bad element, it would be very dangerous. Although the loser can shirk responsibility (having already declared it invalid in the newspaper), it always leaves a gap for bad elements!
    2. Now, our cadres, workers, students... are all citizens of our country. No one has any "privileges." Is it necessary to specifically mark their identity with badges? It can be completely replaced by other documents, such as work permits and student IDs.
    Therefore, I don't think it is necessary to wear badges; and abolishing badges can save the country a lot of metal.

### 建议取消证章

    建议取消证章
    编辑同志：翻开各地的报纸，只要在广告栏里注意一下，你就会暗暗吃惊：遗失证章的人怎么这样多！山东“大众日报”广告栏内，在今年1月份的一个月里，就有二百六十三人声明遗失了证章，其中学生校徽二百三十六枚。这个问题，应该引起我们的注意。这里，我提出废除证章的建议，理由如下：
    一、我认为佩带证章的意义有两点：标志出佩带者的身份和所在的工作或学习单位；便于警卫人员辨别是否本单位的人。但是，证章不能保证不遗失，证章遗失了，万一被坏分子拾去，那就很危险。尽管失者可以推卸责任（已经登报作废），但总是给坏分子留下了空隙！
    二、现在，我们的干部、工人、学生……都是我国的公民，谁也没有什么“特权”，用证章特别标志出他们的身份有什么必要呢？完全可以用其他的证件，如工作证和学生证等来代替。
    所以我认为，没有什么必要非要佩带证章不可；而废除了证章，却又可以为国家节约很多金属。
