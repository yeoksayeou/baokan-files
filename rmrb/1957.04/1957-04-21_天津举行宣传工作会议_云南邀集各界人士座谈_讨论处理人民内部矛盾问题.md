Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 18th: The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's propaganda work conference concluded today. The conference studied and discussed Chairman Mao Zedong's speech at the Supreme State Conference on the correct handling of contradictions among the people and his speech at the National Propaganda Work Conference. After several days of discussion, the participants gained a further understanding of the issue of handling contradictions among the people and the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend."

Kang Sheng, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, attended the meeting and spoke.

The conference focused on how to implement the policy of "unity—criticism—unity."

The participants, in light of the current ideological state of the masses in Tianjin and the problems in practical work, analyzed the specific manifestations of contradictions among the people, pointing out that although contradictions among the people have various manifestations, they often manifest as contradictions between the people and their leaders. In order to resolve these contradictions at any time, it is necessary to overcome bureaucracy, expand democratic life, and strengthen political and ideological education for the people. The meeting believed that, in the future, not only the entire Party and the first secretaries of Party committees should do ideological work, but also the people's governments, mass organizations, democratic parties, and non-Party intellectuals should work together to do ideological work. Leaders at all levels should regularly report to the masses, talk with the masses, and explain issues of current concern to the masses. In order to strengthen unity with the masses, leaders at all levels must share weal and woe with the masses and play an exemplary role in arduous struggle.

The participants warmly supported the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend." Everyone believed that many people inside and outside the Party have not yet truly grasped the spirit of this policy. Therefore, the meeting pointed out that it is necessary to strengthen learning, dispel concerns, and strive to overcome dogmatism, sectarianism, and bureaucracy, and create an environment suitable for the development of science and art. At the same time, intellectuals inside and outside the Party should dare to think independently, adhere to their correct opinions, and expose the unreasonable phenomena in life. Many scientists and artists pointed out in the discussion that the important thing is to have "flowers" and "schools of thought." The previous debate on "Let a hundred schools of thought contend" in Tianjin was necessary, but it cannot stop there. In the future, arduous research work and creative activities should be carried out to produce research results and works. To this end, the meeting proposed that all departments should formulate plans, make specific arrangements, and continuously revise and supplement them in practice.

The meeting also decided to continue studying in conjunction with their own work in the future, requiring that it be thoroughly understood ideologically and implemented in practical work. The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to convey the spirit of correctly handling contradictions among the people to all cadres, university students, and teachers of middle and primary schools. Newspapers and radio stations should actively and vigorously publicize it. At the same time, various departments of the Municipal Committee, mass organizations, cultural and educational departments, and districts should sort out some of the outstanding problems in their respective departments and actively study solutions.

The meeting lasted for nine days. Among the more than 1,000 participants were heads of the Municipal Committee, district committees, and grassroots organizations of the Chinese Communist Party, propaganda cadres inside and outside the Party, scientific workers, professors, engineers, literary and art workers, and journalists. At the meeting, 94 people made oral or written speeches, and Huang Huoqing, first secretary of the Municipal Committee, made a report at the meeting.

This newspaper Kunming dispatch: People from all walks of life in Yunnan Province have recently studied Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference and his speech at the National Propaganda Work Conference, and launched a heated discussion. In recent days, the secretaries of the Provincial Party Committee have separately invited Party members and non-Party members in Kunming from the fields of science, education, medical and health, culture and art to hold symposiums.

Regarding the question of how to correctly understand and handle contradictions among the people, some people proposed: Solving contradictions among the people mainly involves solving the problem of reasonable distribution. Some also proposed: The essence of current contradictions among the people is the contradiction between proletarian ideology and non-proletarian ideology. Some said: In order to better resolve the contradictions between the school leadership and the school masses, is it possible to solicit opinions from the masses on the leadership through the school affairs committee and regular student representative meetings to fully promote democracy?

Regarding the implementation of the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," there has been much heated debate. Most people believe that the main problem in Yunnan at present is that there is not enough "blooming." Some people said that Yunnan's culture is more backward than the inland, so it should be "bloomed" even more, otherwise it will be even more backward. Cultural and artistic figures and several famous actors sharply criticized the provincial and municipal cultural bureaus at the symposium for interfering too much with folk professional theater troupes, bringing a lot of unnecessary troubles and difficulties to the troupes.

Several famous practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine have launched a sharp debate on the relationship between traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, the relationship between practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine, and academic ideas.

    天津举行宣传工作会议　云南邀集各界人士座谈
    讨论处理人民内部矛盾问题
    新华社天津18日电　中共天津市委员会召开的宣传工作会议，已在今天结束。这次会议学习并讨论了毛泽东主席在最高国务会议上关于正确地处理人民内部矛盾问题的讲话和在全国宣传工作会议上的讲话。经过几天的讨论，出席会议的人员对处理人民内部矛盾问题和
  “百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针有了进一步的理解。
    中共中央政治局候补委员康生出席了会议，并且讲了话。
    会议着重对如何贯彻执行“团结—批评—团结”的方针进行了讨论。
    出席会议的人员联系天津市人民群众当前的思想状况和实际工作中的问题，对人民内部矛盾的具体表现进行了分析，指出尽管人民内部矛盾有多种不同的表现形式，但是往往表现为人民群众和他们的领导者之间的矛盾。为了随时解决这些矛盾，必须克服官僚主义、扩大民主生活，并加强对人民群众的政治思想教育。会议认为，今后不仅全党和党委的第一书记要做思想工作，并且要和人民政府、群众团体、民主党派、非党知识分子一起来做思想工作。各级领导干部都应经常向群众做报告，和群众谈话，讲解当前为群众所关心的问题。为了加强同群众的团结，各级领导干部要与群众同甘共苦，在艰苦奋斗方面起模范作用。
    出席会议的人员热烈拥护“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针。大家认为，目前党内外还有很多人没有真正地领会这个方针的精神。因此，会议指出，要加强学习，打消顾虑，应努力克服教条主义、宗派主义和官僚主义，创造一种适合科学艺术发展的环境。同时，党内外知识分子要敢于独立思考，坚持自己的正确意见，揭露生活中的不合理现象。许多科学家和文艺家在讨论中指出，重要的是要有“花”、有“家”。过去天津有过一阵关于“百家争鸣”的争鸣是需要的，但是不能停留在这上面。今后应该进行艰苦的研究工作和创作活动，拿出研究成果来，拿出作品来。为此，会议提出各部门应该制定规划、具体安排，并在实践中不断地加以修正和补充。
    会议还确定今后要结合自己的工作继续学习，要求从思想上搞透，并在实际工作中加以贯彻执行。中共天津市委员会决定要把正确处理人民内部矛盾的精神传达到全体干部中、大学生中和中、小学的教员中去。报纸、电台应该积极地、大张旗鼓地进行宣传。同时，市委各部门、各群众团体、各文教部门、各区要把本部门当前突出的一些问题加以排队，积极研究解决。
    这次会议举行了九天。出席会议的一千多人中，有中共市委、区委和基层组织的负责人、党内外的宣传干部、科学工作者、教授、工程师、文艺工作者、新闻工作者等。会上，有九十四人作了口头或书面的发言，市委第一书记黄火青在会上作了报告。
    本报昆明电　云南省各界人士最近学习了毛主席在最高国务会议上的讲话和在全国宣传工作会议上的讲话，并展开了热烈讨论。连日来，省委书记分别邀请了在昆明的一些科学、教育、医疗卫生、文化艺术等方面的党内外人士举行座谈。
    关于怎样正确认识和处理人民内部矛盾的问题，有人提出：解决人民内部的矛盾，主要是解决合理分配问题。也有人提出：当前人民内部矛盾的实质是无产阶级思想和非无产阶级思想的矛盾。有的人说：为了更好地解决学校领导同学校群众之间的矛盾，是否可以通过校务委员会和定期召开学生代表会议征集群众对领导的意见，以充分发扬民主。
    关于贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”方针的问题，有很多剧烈的争论。多数人认为目前云南主要问题是“放”得不够。有人说云南文化比内地落后，就更应该“放”，否则就要更落后。文化艺术界人士及若干著名演员在座谈会上尖锐地批评了省、市文化局对民间职业剧团干涉太多，带给剧团很多不必要的麻烦和困难。
    若干著名的中西医人士，对于中医与西医、中医与中医之间的关系问题及学术思想问题展开了尖锐的争论。
