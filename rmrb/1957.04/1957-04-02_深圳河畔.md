    Shenzhen Riverside (and another poem)
    Chen Canyun
    On the other side of the Shenzhen River,
    A young British soldier,
    Often sings in loneliness.
    The tune is sorrowful,
    Missing relatives thousands of miles away,
    And the long-lost homeland!
    Sometimes, his gun barrel,
    Hangs with wine bottles and women's stockings;
    Obviously, he has learned to be decadent!
    Obviously, he is a farmer,
    Not interested in guns,
    But he is not allowed to choose freely.
    He looks forward to returning home day and night,
    Unwilling to be nailed to other people's land,
    But he is not allowed to choose freely!
    Then, young man, sing!
    Your singing is not alone,
    There are companions of yours on the Mediterranean Sea as well.

    On the other side of the Shenzhen River,
    Searchlights are on every night.
    The militiamen guarding our village,
    All understand that this light
    Is a symbol of neurasthenia!
    On the other side of the Shenzhen River,
    Seven years as one day,
    There are often war-like sounds of cannons!
    The farmers in our village,
    All understand that this cannon sound
    Is a symbol of neurasthenia!
    Yes, we all understand,
    Behind the lights and cannons there are shadows,
    There are sinful political ghosts,
    Engaging in dark deals,
    Desperate destruction and assassination!

    深圳河畔（外一首）
    陈残云
    深圳河畔的彼岸，
    一个年轻的英国兵，
    常常寂寞地歌唱。
    那声调是悲伤的，
    在思念迢迢万里的亲人，
    和久别的田庄！
    有时候，他的枪杆，
    挂上酒瓶、女人的袜子；
    显然，他学会了颓唐！
    显然，他是个庄稼汉，
    对枪杆没有兴趣，
    但不容许他自由挑选。
    他日盼夜盼归故乡，
    不愿意钉在别人的国土上，
    但不容他自由挑选！
    那末，小伙子呵，你唱吧！
    你的歌声并不孤单，
    地中海上同样有你的同伴。
    无题
    深圳河畔的彼岸，
    夜夜都有探照灯。
    我们村庄上守夜的民兵，
    都懂得，这灯光
    是神经衰弱的象征！
    深圳河畔的彼岸，
    七年如一日，
    经常都有作战式的炮声！
    我们村庄上的种田人，
    都懂得，这炮声
    是神经衰弱的象征！
    是呀，我们一切人都懂得，
    在灯光与炮声的后面有阴影，
    有罪恶的政治亡魂，
    进行着黑暗的买卖，
    绝望的破坏和暗算！
