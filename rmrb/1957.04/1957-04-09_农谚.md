    Proverbs
    Su Keqin
    Chinese farmers have accumulated extremely rich experience in agricultural production through generations of productive labor. This experience is mostly passed on and promoted orally among farmers. Proverbs are one way for farmers to record and disseminate agricultural production experience. It uses popular, concise, and vivid mass language, and adopts the form of maxims to express farmers' production experience. It is easy to understand and remember, and it is pleasant to recite, so it is popular among the masses and easily spread and promoted. From a literary point of view, some proverbs are also beautiful folk literature.
    Proverbs are the collective creation of farmers. With the improvement of farmers' production experience, proverbs are also developing and changing. Some old proverbs are outdated, and new proverbs are constantly being created. The content of proverbs is simple, and some of them contain unscientific elements, but most of them are useful and in line with scientific principles. It, together with all of the farmers' production experience, are the source of agricultural science and part of our country's extremely valuable cultural heritage.
    In the old society, farmers had no opportunity to learn agricultural science knowledge, and the dissemination of farmers' production experience was also spontaneous and unorganized. Since liberation, the Party and the government have taken various measures to impart modern agricultural science knowledge to farmers, promote advanced production experience, and promote agricultural technology reform. Especially since the upsurge of agricultural cooperation and agricultural production in rural areas across the country in the second half of 1955, farmers' production technology has been significantly improved in the large-scale implementation of various production increase measures.
    The various production increase measures promoted by the Party and the government are formulated by using the achievements of modern agricultural science and summarizing the production experience of farmers. Experience has proved that, on the basis of cooperation, striving to learn modern agricultural science knowledge, learning and summarizing farmers' production experience, and correctly combining these two aspects are the main ways to increase agricultural production. Learning modern agricultural science knowledge can guide the reform of agricultural technology; learning and summarizing farmers' production experience can enrich the content of agricultural science, and can also make the reform of agricultural technology adapt to the different conditions of each region. At present, some agricultural workers do not pay enough attention to learning and summarizing farmers' production experience, and some have the problem of mechanically applying advanced technical experience regardless of local conditions and farmers' production experience, which should be corrected. Of course, farmers' production experience cannot be completely copied, but should be critically accepted. A few years ago, some cadres in certain cotton-producing areas in North China cited the proverb "To get rich, grow cotton" as a slogan to mobilize farmers to grow more cotton. However, the reasoning in this proverb is not comprehensive, it does not unify the individual interests of farmers with the overall interests of the country, and it has caused ideological confusion among farmers. Later, it was correctly resolved by the leading organs revising it to "Love the country and get rich, grow more cotton."
    In the work of summarizing farmers' production experience, carrying out investigation and research on proverbs is a very important thing. In this regard, agricultural scientists and agricultural workers in various parts of our country have done a lot of work, and scholars of literature, folklore, local chronicles, and geography in our country have also carried out some research in combination with their own research fields. This work should be continued and strengthened in the future.
    I have not conducted in-depth research on proverbs, but I am very interested in learning them. Now I will excerpt a part of the proverbs I collected in Wanxian area of Hebei Province and introduce them to comrades for reference.
    (Note: The months in the proverbs refer to the lunar months.)
    I. On diligence and thrift in production
    "People nurture the land (referring to cultivating soil fertility), and the land nurtures people." "If people are diligent, the land is not lazy, and the big granary and the small granary are full; if people are diligent, the land is busy, and there is nowhere to hide the grain." "Lazy people produce barren land." "If you don't sow in the spring, you won't harvest in the autumn; if you don't sow in the autumn, you won't harvest in the spring." "The solar terms wait for no one." "Don't gamble when you are idle, tidy up the plough and harrow to plant the fields." "Running around is not as good as picking up manure and grass."
    "The method of accumulating fertilizer for planting is high, and diligent weeding is not in vain when it rains heavily." "If you don't go to the fields in the spring, you will starve on the streets in the autumn." "If you want the crops to grow well, work harder in the fields (鼓捣 means to work)." "Bending over in the autumn is better than turning around ten times in the winter." "To eat, everyone must work." "More people can do more work." "Harmonious sisters-in-law make a family not fall apart, and harmonious brothers make work happy." "If you want to eat your fill, you have to exchange it for sweat." "If you work, you will have food to eat." "Blood and sweat money lasts for ten thousand years." "Diligence, diligence, be sure to be accurate; laziness, laziness, break the bowl." "Don't be afraid of being slow, just be afraid of stopping." "Get up early with three lights, get up late with three panics." "Getting up three days early is worth one day's work." "Eating won't make you poor, dressing won't make you poor, but failing to plan will make you poor." "There is plenty in the big river, and the small river is wide; if there is nothing in the big river, the small river is dry" (this sentence is a metaphor for the economic relationship between the family and the individual, and now it is extended to be a metaphor for the economic relationship between the cooperative and the members). "Save from the top of the granary, and panic when you reach the bottom of the granary" (referring to planning early for saving). "Be able to eat thin gruel continuously" (referring to the meaning of saving food). "Prevent shortage every year." (To be continued)

    农谚
    苏克勤
    我国农民在世世代代的生产劳动中，积累了极为丰富的农业生产经验。这些经验，在农民中多用口头的形式加以传授和推广。农谚就是农民记录和传播农业生产经验的一种方式。它用通俗简练、活泼生动的群众语言，采用格言的形式，表达农民的生产经验，听起来易懂易记，念起来脍炙人口，因此它为群众所喜见乐闻，很容易流传和推广。从文学角度来看，有些农谚也是优美的民间文学。
    农谚是农民的集体创作，随着农民生产经验的提高，农谚也在发展变化。旧的农谚有的过时了，新的农谚不断地创造出来。农谚的内容是朴素的，其中有一些不科学的成分，但大多数都是有用的、合乎科学道理的，它和农民的全部的生产经验，都是农业科学的泉源，是我们祖国的极为宝贵的文化遗产的一部分。
    在旧社会里，农民没有学习农业科学知识的机会，农民的生产经验的传播也是自发和自流的。解放以来，党和政府采取种种措施，向农民传授近代农业科学知识，推广先进的生产经验，推进了农业的技术改革。尤其在1955年下半年全国农村掀起农业合作化和农业生产的高潮以来，在大规模地推行各项增产措施中，农民的生产技术更有了显著的提高。
    党和政府领导推行的各项增产措施是运用现代农业科学的成就和总结农民的生产经验而制定出来的。经验证明，在合作化的基础上，努力学习现代农业科学知识，学习和总结农民的生产经验，并把这两方面正确地结合起来，是增加农业生产的主要途径。学习了现代农业科学知识，才能指导农业的技术改革；学习和总结了农民的生产经验，更能丰富农业科学的内容，而且可以使农业的技术改革适应各个地区的不同条件。目前，还有一些农业工作同志对于学习和总结农民的生产经验不够重视，有的在推广先进的技术经验的时候，不顾当地的具体条件和农民的生产经验，发生了强搬硬套的毛病，这是应该注意纠正的。当然，对于农民的生产经验，也不能全部搬用，而应该批判地接受。前几年在华北某些棉产区曾有些干部援用“要发家，种棉花”的农谚，作为动员农民多种棉花的口号。但这句农谚里讲的道理是不全面的，它没有把农民个人利益和国家整体利益统一起来，曾引起了农民的思想混乱，后经领导机关把它修正为“爱国发家，多种棉花”，才正确地解决了这个问题。
    在总结农民的生产经验的工作中，开展关于农谚的调查研究工作，是一项很重要的事情。在这方面，我国的农业科学家和各地的农业工作者已经做了不少的工作，我国的文学、民俗学、方志和地理学者也在自己的研究领域中，结合着进行了一些研究工作。这些工作，今后应该继续进行并加强起来。
    我对于农谚没有进行过深入的研究工作，但对学习农谚则颇感兴趣。现在把我在河北省完县一带收集到的农谚摘录出一部分，介绍给同志们，供作参考资料。
    （按：农谚中的月份都是指阴历的月份。）
    一、关于勤俭生产的
    “人养地（指培养地力），地养人”。“人勤地不懒，大囤小囤满；人勤地就忙，打的粮食没处藏”。“人懒地生痞”。“春不种，秋不收，秋不种，春不接”。“节气不饶人”。“闲时不必去赌钱，收拾犁耙好种田”。“东奔西跑，不如拾粪弄草”。
    “种地积肥办法高，雨大勤锄不妄劳”。“春天不到地里走，秋后饿的满街走”。“要想庄稼长的好，地里多鼓捣（鼓捣是劳作的意思）。”“秋天弯弯腰，胜过冬天转十遭”。“要吃饭，大家干”。“人多得做活”。“妯娌和美家不散，哥们和美做的欢”。“要想吃饱饭，还得汗珠换”。“有做的就有吃的”。“血汗钱，万万年”。“勤谨，勤谨，一定把准；懒，懒，打了碗”。“不怕慢，就怕站”。“早起三光，晚起三慌”。“早起三天顶一工”。“吃不穷，穿不穷，打算不得就受穷”。“大河里有，小河里宽，大河里没有，小河里干”（这句比喻家庭和个人的经济关系，现在有引伸比喻合作社和社员的经济关系的）。“要省省在囤尖上，省到囤底着了慌”（指节约应早做打算）。“能吃稀溜溜，不断溜溜”（指吃饭要节约的意思）。“年年防歉”。　（未完）
