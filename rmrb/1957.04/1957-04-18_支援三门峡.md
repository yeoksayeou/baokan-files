Supporting the Sanmenxia Project
Sending Personnel, Vehicles, and Vegetables

Since last year, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has successively assigned over a hundred cadres to the Sanmenxia Engineering Bureau and the CCP Sanmenxia Engineering Bureau Committee. Commercial departments at all levels in Henan Province have transferred thousands of service industry personnel to Sanmenxia to serve the construction workers. Currently, Luoyang, Kaifeng, Anyang, Shangqiu, and other places are continuing to transfer personnel or adopt training methods to solve the problem of insufficient service industry workers at the construction site. In addition to establishing health and epidemic prevention stations and maternal and child health stations in Sanmenxia, the Provincial Health Department plans to send another health and epidemic prevention team to be stationed at the construction site for a long time to help carry out health work. In addition, ten theatrical troupes from across the province will tour the Sanmenxia construction site this year.

The Zhengzhou Railway Bureau has established a special Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Hub Project Railway Transportation Branch Bureau to undertake this massive transportation task. At a time when transportation at the construction site is tight, the Provincial Department of Transportation has also promptly dispatched twenty large trucks to provide support.

To ensure a sufficient supply of fresh vegetables to the construction site, agricultural cooperatives near Sanmenxia plan to expand this year's vegetable planting area from 1,500 mu last year to 4,000 mu.

Reservoir Residents Relocate to Gansu to Settle Down

On the 14th, another 1,100 migrants from the Sanmenxia Reservoir area in Shaanxi Province boarded trains in Huayin County and relocated to the Yinchuan Special Zone in Gansu Province to settle down. These migrants are mostly family members of the young and middle-aged migrants who moved last year.

The resettlement work in the Sanmenxia Reservoir area in Shaanxi Province began in August last year. Since the start of the relocation, more than 10,000 migrants have moved to the Yinchuan Special Zone in Gansu Province. They have already built 3,700 houses there and reclaimed a large amount of wasteland, creating conditions for the relocation of entire families, villages, and cooperatives.

More than 80% of the area flooded by the Sanmenxia Reservoir is within Shaanxi Province. Therefore, the province will relocate farmers in the reservoir area in a planned and organized manner in stages and batches. Before the relocation of the residents, the provincial leading organs properly handled their property. Compensation fees were given for the demolition and relocation of houses and the reclamation of wasteland. The leading organs of Gansu Province also allocated a large amount of land to them and established schools, supply and marketing cooperatives, postal and telecommunications departments, and medical clinics near their new homes.

Building Dams and Planting Trees to Reduce Soil Erosion

The amount of sediment flowing into the Yellow River from Shaanxi Province has now been reduced by more than 50 million metric tons, accounting for 10% of the province's average annual input of sediment into the Yellow River. This is the initial contribution of the people of Shaanxi to the fundamental control of the Yellow River.

Shaanxi Province is the area with the most severe soil erosion in the Yellow River basin. Of the province's 190,000 square kilometers of land, more than 132,000 square kilometers are affected by soil erosion. Moreover, it is mostly concentrated in northern Shaanxi, and the annual sediment input into the Yellow River from rivers such as the Jing, Wei, Luo, and Wuding Rivers is about 540 million metric tons, accounting for 39.5% of the annual sediment transport volume of the Yellow River at Shanxian County.

In order to reduce the amount of sediment flowing into the Yellow River, farmers in Shaanxi, especially in northern Shaanxi, have started large-scale soil and water conservation work since 1950. Farmers in the Yulin and Yan'an Special Zones have successively improved farming techniques on 7.47 million mu of land and built more than 100,000 field projects such as terraces, valley dams, silt detention dams, and gully head protection. In more than ten counties such as Suide and Mizhi, 80,000 to 90,000 farmers used simple steel chisels, iron shovels, and other tools to open mountains, quarry rocks, dig soil, and excavate mud, successively building 55 large silt-retaining earth dams in more than 40 gullies. Farmers in the Yulin Special Zone have planted more than 500,000 mu of windbreak and sand-fixation forests in the desert areas along the Great Wall. Due to the unremitting work of the people in various places, the area of soil erosion controlled in northern Shaanxi has reached more than 19,000 square kilometers in the past four years.

Since this spring, agricultural cooperatives in the Yulin and Yan'an Special Zones, based on the principle of "treating both gullies and slopes and concentrating on governance," have begun comprehensive watershed management in many gullies with relatively serious soil erosion. It is required to control the area of soil erosion within 7,300 square kilometers this year. (The above is based on Xinhua News Agency reports)

### 支援三门峡

    支援三门峡
    出人出车出蔬菜
    中共河南省委从去年以来已先后为三门峡工程局及中共三门峡工程局委员会配备了一百多名干部。河南省各级商业部门先后抽调了数以千计的各类服务性行业人员去三门峡为工地建筑者服务。目前洛阳、开封、安阳、商丘等地还在继续抽调一部分人员或采取代为培养的办法，解决工地服务性行业工作人员不足的困难。省卫生厅除了在三门峡增设卫生防疫站、妇幼保健站以外，准备再派一个卫生防疫队，长期驻在工地帮助开展卫生工作。此外，全省今年还将有十个剧团巡回去三门峡工地演出。
    郑州铁路管理局专门成立了一个三门峡水利枢纽工程铁路运输分局，来担负这浩繁的运输任务。在目前工地运输紧张的时候，省交通厅还及时调来了二十部大卡车加以支援。
    为保证供应工地足够的新鲜蔬菜，三门峡附近的农业社，今年的蔬菜播种面积计划由去年的一千五百亩扩大到四千亩。
    水库居民迁往甘肃安家
    14日，陕西省境内三门峡水库区又有一千一百多名移民在华阴县坐上火车，迁往甘肃省的银川专区安家落户。这批移民大都是去年迁移的青壮年移民的家属。
    陕西省境内三门峡水库区的移民工作是在去年8月开始的。从开始迁移到现在共有一万多移民迁到甘肃省银川专区。现在，他们已经在那里建筑了三千七百多间房屋，并开垦了大批荒地，为全家、全村和全社迁移创造了条件。
    三门峡水库淹没的地区，有80％以上在陕西省境内。因此，这个省将把水库区的农民有计划有组织地分期分批外迁。已经迁移的居民，在迁移前，省领导机关对他们的财产进行了妥善的处理。对移民拆除、迁建房屋和开垦荒地都给了补偿费。甘肃省的领导机关也给他们划出大批土地，在他们的新居附近成立了学校、供销合作社、邮电部门和医疗所。
    筑坝植林减少水土流失
    现在从陕西省境内流入黄河的泥沙，已经减少了五千多万公吨，占这个省河流年平均输入黄河泥沙量的10％。这是陕西人民对于根治黄河的初步贡献。
    陕西省是黄河流域水土流失最严重的地区，全省十九万平方公里的土地上，就有十三万二千多平方公里有水土流失灾害。而且多集中在陕北地区，每年由泾、渭、洛和无定河等河流输入黄河的泥沙约有五亿四千多万公吨，占黄河陕县年输沙量的39.5％。
    为了减少泥沙流入黄河，陕西特别是陕北地区的农民从1950年以来，就开始了大规模的水土保持工作。榆林、延安专区的农民，先后在七百四十七万亩土地上改良耕作技术，并修筑梯田、谷坊、淤地坝和沟头防护等田间工程十万多个。绥德、米脂等十多县有八、九万农民使用简单的钢钎、铁锹等工具，开山凿石，掘土挖泥，先后在四十多条沟壑内修成五十五座大型拦淤土坝。榆林专区的农民，在长城沿线的沙漠地区，已经营造防风防沙林五十多万亩。由于各地人民坚持不懈的工作，四年来，陕北地区控制水土流失面积一万九千多平方公里。
    今春以来，榆林、延安专区的各农业社，根据“沟坡兼治、集中治理”的原则，已在许多水土流失比较严重的沟壑内，开始进行全面的综合性流域治理。要求在今年内控制水土流失面积七千三百多平方公里。　　　　　（以上据新华社讯）
