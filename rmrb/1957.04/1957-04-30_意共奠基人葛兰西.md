Gramsci, the founder of the Italian Communist Party and a great Italian Marxist theorist, was born in 1891. In 1913, he joined the Italian Socialist Party and quickly became one of the outstanding leaders of the left wing.

From his youth, Gramsci conducted extensive propaganda work among the working masses. He obtained Lenin's works and the Bolshevik Party's documents from abroad. After the October Socialist Revolution, in 1919-1920, he led the revolutionary movement of the Turin factory soviets and, together with Togliatti and others, founded the "New Order" newspaper to prepare for the establishment of a revolutionary party of the Italian working class.

In 1921, Gramsci and Togliatti, among others, left the Socialist Party and founded the Italian Communist Party. In 1922, he attended the Fourth Congress of the Communist International in Moscow and was elected as a member of the Executive Committee of the Communist International.

After returning to Italy from the Soviet Union, Gramsci took on the leadership of the Italian Communist Party. Under the fascist rule in Italy, he led the party in a resolute struggle for peace, democracy, and freedom. In the article "Analysis of the Italian Situation in 1926," Gramsci exposed the fascist crimes of the Mussolini government. On November 8, 1926, Mussolini ordered his arrest, and he was sentenced to twenty years, four months, and five days in prison, exiled to the island of Ustica.

Whether in exile or in prison, Gramsci did not lose contact with the party, and he continued to lead the party's underground activities, organizing the people's anti-fascist front.

During his exile, Gramsci wrote "Prison Notebooks." In this book, he used the method of historical materialism to put forward new Marxist views on Italian history, giving a decisive blow to the reactionary bourgeois historiography. "Prison Notebooks" and his "Prison Letters" have great theoretical education and literary significance. He defended and developed Marxism-Leninism.

On April 27, 1937, Gramsci died after eleven years of cruel prison torment.

    意共奠基人葛兰西
    意大利共产党的奠基人和意大利伟大的马克思主义理论家——葛兰西同志生于1891年，1913年加入意大利社会党，并很快就成了左翼的杰出领袖之一。
    从青年时代起，葛兰西便在工人群众中进行了广泛的宣传工作。他从国外得到了列宁的著作和布尔什维克党的文件。十月社会主义革命后，1919—1920年他领导了都灵工厂苏维埃的革命运动，并同陶里亚蒂等人创办“新秩序报”，为建立意大利工人阶级的革命政党而作准备。
    1921年，葛兰西和陶里亚蒂等离开了社会党，创建了意大利共产党。1922年他参加了在莫斯科召开的共产国际第四次代表大会，被选为共产国际执委会的委员。
    从苏联回国后，葛兰西担任了意大利共产党的领导工作。在意大利法西斯统治下，他领导党为和平民主自由而进行坚决的斗争。在“分析1926年意大利局势”的文章里，葛兰西揭露了墨索里尼政府的法西斯罪行。1926年11月8日他被墨索里尼下令逮捕，被判处二十年四个月零五天的徒刑，流放到乌斯的喀岛。
    不论在流放期间或牢狱里，葛兰西都没有失掉与党的联系，而且继续领导党的地下活动，组织了人民反法西斯战线。
    在流放时期，葛兰西写成了“狱中札记”。在这本书中，他运用历史唯物主义的方法，提出了关于意大利历史的新的、马克思主义的观点，给了反动的资产阶级的历史编纂学以决定性的打击。“狱中札记”和他的“狱中通信”具有巨大的理论教育和文学意义。他保卫和发展了马克思列宁主义。
    1937年4月27日，葛兰西在经过十一年的残酷的狱中磨折后病逝。
