    The British Rent Act: Robbing the Poor to Enrich the Rich
    Le Shan
    In 1949, when the British Conservative Party was still in opposition, it offered the people a generous promise: rent control must continue until the housing shortage is resolved. However, once the Conservative Party regained power, it completely abandoned its promise, regardless of the increasingly severe housing shortage. Instead of taking measures to improve the living conditions of the working people, it repeatedly increased their rent burden.
    The housing shortage in Britain is very serious. According to statistics, in 1952, about two million families in Britain lacked housing, and about 300,000 people lived in mobile homes towed by cars. Every year, 200,000 houses in Britain gradually become unsuitable for use. The 1953 British government white paper acknowledged that about 2.25 million houses in Britain had been in use for more than a century, and 2.5 million houses had been in use for more than 65 years.
    Under these circumstances, the Conservative Party insisted on lowering people's housing standards, abolishing housing construction subsidies, and advocating that housing construction be contracted to private merchants. In 1954, the Conservative government proposed the so-called "Housing Rent and Repair Act." According to this act, landlords could raise rents after spending a certain amount of money on repairing houses, which gave landlords a lot of profit. An article in the British "Stock Exchange Gazette" described these wealthy landlords, with the author saying: "Most of the real estate figures I have met are people who are good at making money and are on the rise. I mean, they have all made money secretly in the operation of real estate, and some are building empires of real estate companies. Many people have made money. They either go to Bermuda, the Bahamas for vacation, take sea cruises, or buy shares in Lloyd's Bank." The British "United Real Estate Company" also admitted in a report: "Rental income has increased significantly, and net profit has more than doubled. The company's increase in profits is a direct result of the implementation of the 1954 'Housing Rent and Repair Act'."
    On November 7, 1956, the Conservative government proposed a new rent act that fiercely attacked the interests of the working people, aiming to completely abolish rent control. After the bill was announced, British speculators immediately engaged in large-scale speculative activities, buying many houses and residences, planning to raise rents after the parliament passed the bill or evict the previous tenants and sell the houses at high prices. The people threatened by this bill are about six million families, accounting for half of the British population, who live in houses rented from landlords. Once this bill becomes law, rent control on about one million houses with higher rents will be immediately lifted, and landlords can charge rents according to the amount they stipulate. Tenants who are unwilling to pay should move out within six months. Tenants in other approximately 4.75 million houses will have to pay an average of at least ten shillings more per week in rent, and rent control on these houses will also be abolished after the current tenants move out.
    The new rent act will increase the income of landlords by 200 million pounds per year. No wonder the stocks of general real estate companies in Britain have risen with the wind.
    After the British government proposed the new rent act, it aroused the anger and opposition of the vast number of tenants and working people. The Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain issued a statement on November 11, 1956, supporting the British Labour Party's opposition to the rent act in the House of Commons, and called on the British people to take joint action to defeat the bill. After that, the movement of the British people against the rent act surged. On March 17, five thousand tenants in London held a demonstration against the rent act. The British National Tenants Association, representing 600,000 people, also firmly protested against the government's abolition of the rent control act.
    However, the British House of Commons, disregarding the strong opposition of the masses, passed the rent act on its third reading on March 28 by a vote of 321 to 261, and submitted it to the House of Lords for discussion. Although the British authorities hope to turn this bill into law and implement it as soon as possible, this bill has been generally recognized as the most unpopular measure of the Conservative Party, and can only accelerate the collapse of the Conservative government, which has become increasingly obvious.

    劫贫济富的英国房租法案
    乐山
    1949年，当英国保守党还是一个反对党的时候，它曾经向人民提供了一个慷慨的诺言：在房荒问题没有解决以前，房租管制必须继续执行。但是，保守党一旦重新执政，却不管房荒情况更为严重，而把自己的诺言丢得干干净净。它不但没有采取改善劳动人民居住条件的措施，反而一再地加重劳动人民的房租负担。
    英国的房荒是十分严重的。据统计，在1952年，英国约有两百万个家庭缺乏住宅，约有三十万人住在用汽车拖着的活动房屋内。英国每年有二十万所住宅逐渐不适于使用。1953年英政府白皮书承认，英国约有二百二十五万幢房屋使用了一百年以上，二百五十万幢房屋使用了六十五年以上。
    在这种情况下，保守党却主张降低人民居住标准，取消房屋建筑津贴，并主张将房屋营造交由私商承包。1954年，保守党政府提出了所谓“房屋租金及修理法案”。根据这个法案，房东为修理房屋用去一定数目的款项以后，就可以提高房租，这使房东获得了不少的利润。英国“股票交易公报”上有一篇文章描写这些发了财的房东，作者这样说：“我所遇见的房地产界人物，大都是生财有道、指日高升的人。我的意思是说，他们大都在房地产的经营中暗地里发了财，有些人正在筹建房地产公司的帝国。发了财的人不少。他们或到百慕大、或到巴哈马去休假、或作海上之游，或购买劳合银行的股票。”英国的“联合房地产公司”在一项报告中也承认：“房租的收入有了显著的增加，净利增加一倍以上。公司此项利润的增加，是1954年‘房屋租金及修理法案’实施的直接结果。”
    1956年11月7日，保守党政府又提出了一个向劳动人民利益猛烈进攻的新房租法案，旨在完全废除房租管制。法案公布以后，英国投机商人立即大肆进行投机活动，买进了许多房屋与住宅，打算在议会通过这个法案以后提高房租或是把以前的房客撵出去，再把房子高价出售。而受到这个法案威胁的是约占英国人口一半、居住在房东出租的房屋中的六百万户家庭。这个法案一旦成为法律，大约有一百万幢租金较高的房屋的房租管制将立即解除，房东可以按照自己规定的数目收取租金，不愿照缴的房客应在六个月以内迁出。其他约四百七十五万幢房屋的房客，每周至少要平均多出十先令的房租，而这些房屋的房租管制，在现房客迁出以后，也将要被取消。
    新的房租法案将使房东每年增加两亿英镑的收入。无怪英国一般房地产公司的股票都已见风上涨。
    英国政府提出新的房租法案后，激起了广大房客和劳动人民的愤怒和反对。英国共产党执行委员会在1956年11月11日发表了一项声明，支持英国工党在下院对房租法案的反对，并号召英国人民采取联合行动击败这个法案。在这以后，英国人民反对房租法案的运动风起云涌。3月17日伦敦五千房客举行示威，反对房租法案。代表六十万人的英国全国房客协会也坚决抗议政府的废除房租管制法案。
    但是，英国下院却不顾人民群众的强烈反对，于3月28日以三百二十一票对二百六十一票三读通过了房租法案。并将它提交上院讨论。尽管英国当局希望尽快将这个法案变成法律，付诸实施，但是这个法案已经被公认为是保守党最不得人心的一项措施，只能使保守党政府加速垮台，这一点已经愈来愈为明显了。（附图片）
