Is "Covering Up" Good? Or is "Going Public" Good?
		Lù Hào

    In the rural areas of Liaoning Province, some agricultural cooperatives, due to the overestimation of labor day value in the original autumn harvest distribution plan last year, distributed too much when the actual distribution took place. As a result, some cooperative members received more money from the cooperative than they were due; others were owed "IOUs" by the cooperative. According to a survey of 130 cooperatives in Changtu County, 20,318 cooperative member households had received a total of 523,000 yuan more than they were due; while another 20,900+ households were owed a total of 519,000 yuan by the cooperatives. With the spring plowing season approaching, if these accounts are not cleared up quickly, they will inevitably have a very negative impact on the farmers' production enthusiasm. If handled well, the problem is not that difficult to solve.

    The Democratic Third Agricultural Cooperative of Democratic Township in Changtu County initially planned to distribute 2.90 yuan per labor day; by the time of the end of the busy season, the estimate was 1.50 yuan; the autumn harvest pre-distribution was calculated at 1.30 yuan; but in reality, each labor day could only be distributed at 1.18 yuan. Out of the cooperative's 523 households, more than 200 households received 10,000 yuan less than they were due. As a result of the over-distribution, the cooperative owed the members "IOUs," with the most owed being over 100 yuan per household, and the least being several tens of yuan. Faced with this situation, the cadres of the Democratic Third Cooperative openly and thoroughly explained the cooperative's financial income and expenditure to the members, explained each account clearly, without any ambiguity, and also made self-criticisms, welcoming members to offer criticisms. Before knowing all the details, the members originally had many concerns about the cooperative cadres: those who received more money were afraid that the cooperative would come after them to get the money back; those who received less were afraid that they would not receive the money and suffer a loss, they were suspicious and gossiped. But after the cooperative cadres explained the whole situation clearly, everyone's thoughts were connected. The members said: This is the first year of running the cooperative, no one has any experience, it doesn't matter. A voluntary transfer account method was adopted between the members who received more money and those who received less. Because they were either relatives or close neighbors to each other, some did some work for others, and others gave them some things, so the members who received more money were considered to have paid back the money; and the members who received less money also received real benefits. Using this transfer account method, the problem was basically solved. In the end, the agricultural cooperative only owed money to 15 households, because the members understood their own financial situation, and some of them were willing to regard this money as their investment in the cooperative, and those who were not willing to invest also expressed their peace of mind and agreed that the cooperative would return it to them in the future. As for the cooperative cadres, they also felt as if they had unloaded a heavy burden. After people eliminated their concerns, they all wholeheartedly prepared for spring plowing production.

    Contrary to the Democratic Third Cooperative of Changtu County, there is another situation: after some agricultural cooperatives over-distributed, the cooperative cadres adopted a "covering up" approach. They felt that they had made a promise, but now they could not achieve it, and it was difficult to explain to the members; they were afraid that the members would be dissatisfied, and they were afraid of exposing the shortcomings in their work, so they dodged and patched things up, racking up a pile of debts, and in the end the problem could not be solved. For example, the Democratic Agricultural Cooperative of Baiqi Township in Fengcheng County actually only distributed 0.70 yuan per labor day, but they distributed it according to 0.75 yuan. In the end, 215 households received more than 7,000 yuan; while another part of the members were owed more than 10,000 yuan by the cooperative. The cadres of this cooperative failed to explain the situation to the members in a timely manner, but instead borrowed money from this production team to pay back to that production team, and then borrowed money from that production team to pay another part of the members. When there was really no way, they borrowed more than 6,000 yuan from the credit cooperative, but it was still not enough, so they wanted to sell the remaining charcoal, tobacco dust, and hundreds of sets of jars in the cooperative to pay off the members' labor remuneration. Although they had good intentions, the problem still could not be solved. This approach not only exhausted the cooperative cadres and made them feel uneasy, but also caused great dissatisfaction among the members. No one knew how much they had received more or less. They were worried that the accounts were unclear and whether there was something fishy in them? They were even more worried that the labor results of this year's production would fall into a chaotic situation like last year? In such agricultural cooperatives, the farmers' emotions fluctuated, and they often asked the cooperative cadres for payment, and the cooperative cadres also had a headache. This has become one of the important problems that urgently needs to be solved in the current spring plowing production.

    Facts show that if there is a problem with the financial income and expenditure of the agricultural cooperative, the cooperative cadres can only openly explain the details to the members like Changtu County did to gain the understanding and help of the members. On the contrary, adopting a "covering up" approach not only does not help solve the problem, but will only become more and more passive the more it is "covered up." Paper cannot wrap fire.

    “捂”着好？公开好？
    陆灏
    在辽宁省的农村里，有些农业社由于去年原订的秋收分配计划中预计的劳动日价值过高，到实际分配的时候，就分过了头。结果，有的社员多领了社里的钱；有的社反而欠了社员一笔空头账。据昌图县一百三十个社的调查，有两万零三百一十八户社员，多领了社里五十二万三千多元；另有两万零九百多户社员，社里还欠他们五十一万九千多元。春耕将到，这些账目如果不赶快清理，对于农民们的生产情绪势必发生极为不好的影响。如果处理得好，问题也不是很难解决的。
    昌图县民主乡民主第三农业社，最初计划一个劳动日可分二元九角；到挂锄的时候，估计可分一元五角；秋收预分按一元三角算的；实际上每个劳动日只能分到一元一角八分。全社五百二十三户，其中有二百多户少领了一万来元。冒分的结果，欠了社员一笔空头账，最多的欠每户一百多元，最少的也欠几十元。民主三社的干部们在这种情况的面前，把全社的财务收支情况公开地向社员们作了详细的交代，并把每一笔账目说得清清楚楚，一点也不含糊，还作了自我批评，欢迎社员们提出批评。社员们在没有知道全部底细前，本来对于社干部是有很多顾虑的，多领了的怕社里追着要钱；少领的怕领不到钱自己吃亏，猜神疑鬼，议论纷纷。但当社干部把全部情形讲明白以后，大家的思想都沟通了。社员们说：头一年办社，谁也没有经验，没有关系。多领了钱的和少领钱的社员之间，采取了自愿转账的办法。由于他们相互之间不是亲戚就是近邻，于是你为他做一点工，他给我送一点东西，这样多领了钱的社员也算还了钱；少领了钱的社员也得到了实惠。用这种转账的方式，基本上把问题解决了。最后，农业社只欠十五户社员的钱，因为社员们了解了自己的家底，其中有的社员就愿意把这笔钱算作自己的投资存在社里，有的不愿投资的也表示很放心，同意社里将来归还他们。至于社干部们，也像卸下了千斤重担一样轻松了。人们在消除了顾虑以后，都一心一意地准备春耕生产了。
    同昌图县民主三社相反的是另外一种情况：有些地方的农业社冒分以后，社干部采取了“捂”的办法。他们觉得自己许下愿了，现在达不到，不好向社员交代；他们害怕社员不满意，害怕暴露自己工作中的缺点，于是躲躲闪闪、东补西借，拉了一屁股账，结果事情还是不能解决。像凤城县白旗乡的民主农业社，实际上一个劳动日只能分七角钱，但他们是按七角五分钱分的。分到最后，有二百一十五户多分了七千多元钱；而另外一部分社员，社里还欠他们一万余元。这个社的社干部没有能够向社员及时地说清楚，而是向这个生产队借上钱还给那个生产队，又向那个生产队借钱付给另外一部分社员。到实在没有办法的时候，又向信用社借了六千多元钱，结果还是不够，他们又想卖掉社内剩下的木炭、烟末和几百套缸来清付社员们的劳动报酬。尽管他们是一片好心，可是问题还是不能解决。这种做法，不但使社干部们精疲力尽，情绪不安，同时社员们也表现了极大的不满。他们多分多少，少分多少，谁也没有个底。他们担心账目不清，是不是其中有鬼？更担心今年生产的劳动成果会不会像去年那样陷入混乱的局面？在这样的农业社里，农民们的情绪波动，他们常向社干部要账，社干部也非常头疼。这就成为目前备耕生产中迫切需要解决的重要问题之一。
    事实说明，农业社的财政收支上出了问题，社干部只有像昌图县向社员公开说明底细，才能取得社员群众的谅解和帮助。相反的，采取“捂”的办法，不仅无助于问题的解决，而且会越“捂”越被动。纸是包不住火的。
