Improving Translation Work
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

Translation is a means for people of all countries to communicate with each other. In order to strengthen scientific and cultural exchanges as well as economic and political ties between our country and the people of all countries, to absorb the excellent heritage and new achievements of foreign science and culture, and to understand the experiences of various countries in construction so as to improve our country's scientific and cultural level and accelerate our socialist construction, translation work must be continuously strengthened.

Our country's translation work has a long history. Especially in the past hundred years, Chinese translators have strived to introduce modern world culture and scientific thought, making significant contributions to promoting social progress and cultural development in our country. Our Party has always attached importance to translation work. In the past, even under extremely difficult conditions, it vigorously organized translation work, translating and publishing Marxist-Leninist works and progressive foreign literary works. After the national liberation, translation work was elevated to a more important position. Many professional translation institutions were established one after another. The hard work of translators has been valued by the Party, the government, and the people, and they have also become more serious and conscientious in their work. Translation work has greatly developed. In the past seven years, more than 13,700 books have been translated from various languages into Chinese, with a total print run of more than 225 million copies. A large proportion of these translations are of excellent quality. The number of designs, products, and academic materials translated by many basic construction, production, and scientific units is even greater. Translators have also played an important role in the work of Soviet and other foreign experts assisting our country's socialist construction, as well as in foreign visits and receiving foreign guests.

Since liberation, the Party and the government have attached great importance to the training of translation cadres, especially Russian language cadres. In addition to general foreign language schools and training courses, eight foreign language colleges and Russian language colleges have been established, and foreign language departments have been established in many comprehensive universities. In the past six or seven years, tens of thousands of foreign language cadres have been trained. The newly trained foreign language cadres, together with experienced translators, are distributed in different posts in construction undertakings throughout the country, contributing their glorious labor.

The country and the people need translation work, and translators are also doing their best to complete their tasks.

Translation is an arduous task. A translator must not only master the languages of both their own country and foreign countries, but also possess certain professional knowledge and translation skills. An excellent or mature translator must also have rich linguistic knowledge and professional knowledge, and must undergo long-term translation practice in order to be able to happily undertake their work. Some people lack a correct understanding of translation work, thinking that understanding a foreign language is enough to do translation, and that a translator can translate anything. They do not know that there is still a considerable distance between understanding a foreign language and translating it; similarly, there is a big difference between written translation and interpretation, between translating from Chinese to foreign languages and from foreign languages to Chinese; and there are even more differences between different professions. Some people also think that translation work is simply copying mechanically, and that there are no difficulties. Due to a lack of understanding of translation, it is often easy to underestimate translation work. Some units with translation work do not pay attention to the leadership of translation business, do not pay attention to the training and further study of translation cadres, and some units have not appropriately resolved the treatment of translation cadres, thereby affecting the work enthusiasm of some translators. Some units use translation cadres unreasonably, causing stockpiling and waste, which brings losses to the country's construction.

Some translators also lack a correct understanding of translation work, thinking that translation work is not a creative academic work, and that they cannot obtain the results of their research like scientific workers, thus despising their own business, being uneasy in their positions, and even wanting to change careers and find other ways out, which is obviously also incorrect. It should be pointed out that translation, like any other academic work, has great creativity to be developed, and can reach a high level through hard work and long-term practice. The tasks facing translators are urgent and arduous. Countless basic construction and production materials and drawings need to be continuously translated. There is a vast ocean of world masterpieces that have not been translated into Chinese, and many important works in our country have not been translated into foreign languages. The works that need to be translated are endless, the translation business that can be studied has no limit, and the field of specialized academic research combined with translation is even broader. Therefore, the development prospects for translators are very broad.

Translators should value their work, regard it as their lifelong career, prevent and overcome complacency, and constantly improve their language skills and professional knowledge in order to further improve the quality of translation and better serve the cause of socialist construction.

In order to improve translation work, the following issues must be resolved at present:

First, the rational use of existing translation cadres. In order to meet objective needs, existing translators should be rationally arranged and adjusted, and efforts should be made to ensure that they can achieve consistency between what they have learned and what they are using, and that specialized talents are used for specialized purposes. Correct the unreasonable phenomenon of assigning foreign language graduates to be accountants, physical education teachers, etc. Cadres with higher foreign language proficiency who are suitable for translation work but are assigned to positions unrelated to language work may be appropriately adjusted or assigned certain translation tasks so that they can give full play to their expertise. Units with too many translation cadres should transfer some of them to posts where such cadres are needed. Relevant departments should conduct thorough investigations, carefully study, and make appropriate arrangements.

Second, improve the professional level of existing translation cadres. At present, translation cadres in various business departments, especially Russian language cadres, are a considerable force in terms of quantity, but there are not many mature translation cadres who can work independently, and even fewer who are good at translating from Chinese to foreign languages. To this end, all relevant units must create conditions to enable in-service translation cadres to generally study and improve their professional level in their work posts. Some units with a large number of translators can set up their own refresher courses to train translators who combine with their professions, or take other measures to give them the opportunity to receive advanced studies. Some units can, according to work needs and the personal conditions of translators, let them learn professional knowledge and technology, or transfer them to professional colleges for study. This issue also needs to be studied and resolved by relevant business departments.

Third, strengthen the work of training foreign language cadres. In the future, more foreign language cadres with more languages should be trained, and the number of students enrolled in each language should be determined according to actual needs. In recent years, too few Western language cadres and some Oriental language cadres with a wide range of applications have been trained, and this should be appropriately increased. The training of language cadres should not only pay attention to quantity, but more importantly, ensure a certain quality. The study time in foreign language departments should be appropriately extended, and some foreign language students should be sent to study abroad for further study. In the future, foreign language departments should emphasize the teaching of basic foreign languages, pay attention to the training of practical language application skills, and strive to train teachers and translators. The foreign language foundation in secondary schools should be gradually improved to prepare conditions for foreign language majors in colleges and universities. The foreign language schools and training courses run by certain business units should be appropriately adjusted and merged so that foreign language teaching talents can be used rationally and the quality of teaching can be improved.

Fourth, strengthen translation and publishing work. In addition to classical Marxist-Leninist works and important theoretical works related to them, foreign language works with higher levels and extremely beneficial to our country's economic and cultural construction should be selected for translation in science and technology and literature and art. Under no circumstances should foreign language works be translated indiscriminately, nor should translated manuscripts be published without asking about the quality of the translation. The phenomenon of some publishing houses publishing too many inferior books and low-quality translations must be corrected. Existing professional translation institutions should be strengthened and appropriately adjusted, outstanding foreign language cadres should be recruited to participate in translation, and necessary measures should be taken to cultivate new forces. Relevant publishing houses have now paid attention to the translation and publication of world masterpieces in various fields such as philosophy, social sciences, and natural sciences, and are formulating longer-term plans and starting to widely organize experts from all fields to translate, which is a very important matter. Not only should we attach importance to the planned translation of classical masterpieces, but we should also attach importance to the publication of valuable academic works in the world today, and introduce and translate them in a timely manner. Colleges and universities, scientific research institutions, and all experts who are capable of translating these works should be encouraged to undertake this translation work. The style of strict and serious work of translators on their own translations should be advocated, so as to be faithful to the original work and the translation is smooth and easy to understand, so that translated books and periodicals can gain higher prestige among readers.

Attaching importance to and strengthening translation work is an important task in our country's construction. The problems existing in translation work must attract the attention of all parties and be resolved quickly and rationally.

    改进翻译工作
    本报评论员
    翻译是各国人民互通语言的手段。为了密切我国与各国人民之间的科学文化的交流以及经济和政治的联系，吸收各国科学文化的优秀遗产和新的成就，了解各国建设的经验，以便提高我国科学文化水平，加速我国社会主义建设事业，翻译工作必须不断地予以加强。
    我国翻译事业具有悠久的历史。特别是近百年来，我国的翻译工作者，努力地介绍了世界近代文化和科学思潮，对推动我国社会进步和文化发展作了重大的贡献。我们的党向来重视翻译工作，过去在异常艰苦的条件下，就大力组织翻译工作，把马克思列宁主义著作和外国进步文艺作品翻译出版。全国解放后，翻译工作被提到更重要的地位。许多专业性的翻译机构相继成立。翻译工作者的辛勤劳动受到党、政府和人民的重视，而他们也更加严肃认真地从事自己的工作。翻译工作有了很大的发展。七年来从各国文字译成中文出版的书籍共达一万三千七百多种，印数共达二亿二千五百多万册。其中有很大部分的翻译质量是优良的。在许多基本建设、生产、科学单位译出的设计、产品、学术资料为数更大。在苏联和其他各国专家帮助我国社会主义建设的工作中，在出国访问和接待外宾的工作中，翻译人员也起了重要的作用。
    解放后，党和政府对于翻译干部，特别是俄文干部的培养十分重视。除一般外语学校和训练班外，开办了八个外语学院和俄语院校，并在许多综合大学内设立了外语系。近六、七年来培养了好几万外语干部。新培养出来的外语干部和已有相当经验的翻译家一起，分布在全国各地建设事业的不同岗位上，贡献着自己的一份光荣的劳动。
    国家和人民需要翻译工作，翻译工作者也在尽力完成自己的任务。
    翻译是一项艰巨的工作。一个翻译工作者，不仅要掌握本国和外国语言，而且还要具备一定的专业知识和翻译技能。一个优良的或成熟的翻译工作者，还须具备丰富的语文修养和专业知识，并且要经过长期的翻译实践，才能胜任愉快地担负起自己的工作。有一些人对于翻译工作缺乏正确的了解，以为懂了外文就可以做翻译，既然是翻译就什么都能翻。不知道懂外文和翻译外文，两者之间还有一个相当大的距离；同样是翻译，笔译与口译之间，中译外和外译中之间，又有很大的距离；一种专业与另一种专业之间更有许多差别。也有人以为翻译工作就是依葫芦画瓢很简单，没有什么困难。由于对翻译缺乏了解，往往容易发生轻视翻译工作的现象。有些有翻译工作的单位不注意对翻译业务的领导，不注意翻译干部的培养和进修，有些单位对翻译干部的待遇问题没有适当地加以解决，因而影响某些翻译人员的工作积极性。有些单位使用翻译干部不合理，造成积压浪费，给国家建设事业带来损失。
    翻译人员中也有人对翻译工作缺乏正确的认识，以为翻译工作不是一种创造性的学术工作，不能像科学工作者那样获得自己研究的成果，因而轻视自己的业务，不安于位，甚至一心想改行，另找出路，这显然也是不正确的。应该指出，翻译和其他任何学术性的工作一样，有很大的创造性可以发挥，并且经过刻苦钻研和长期实践，可以达到很高的造诣。摆在翻译工作者面前的任务是迫切和艰巨的。无数基本建设、生产的资料和图纸，需要继续翻译，有浩如烟海的世界名著没有译成中文，我国有许多重要作品没有译成外文。需要翻译的作品是无穷的，可以钻研的翻译业务是没有止境的，结合翻译研究专门学术的领域更是很广阔的，因此翻译工作者的发展前途是非常宽广的。
    翻译人员应该重视自己的工作，把它看作自己的毕生事业，防止和克服尝试和自满的思想，不断提高语文水平和专业知识，以进一步提高翻译质量，更好地为社会主义建设事业服务。
    为了改进翻译工作，目前必须解决以下几个问题：
    第一是合理使用现有的翻译干部。为了满足客观需要，对于现有的翻译人员应该进行合理的安排和调整，要尽量使他们能做到学用一致，专材专用。纠正那些把外语毕业生派去做会计、体育教员等不合理的现象。外文修养较高，适于做翻译工作而分配在与语文工作无关的职位上的干部，可考虑适当调整，或分配给他们一定的翻译任务，使他们能发挥专长。拥有翻译干部过多的单位，应该调出一部分，分派到需要这种干部的岗位上去。有关部门应周密调查，仔细研究，作出妥善安排。
    第二是提高现有翻译干部的业务水平。目前各种业务部门的翻译干部，特别是俄文干部，在数量上是一支相当可观的队伍，但是比较成熟的能独立工作的翻译干部并不很多，善于从中文译成外文的更少。为此，各有关单位必须创造条件，使在职的翻译干部一般都能在工作岗位上进修，提高业务水平。有些单位翻译人数较多，可自行成立进修班，培养与专业相结合的翻译家，或采取其他办法使他们有机会获得深造。有些单位可以根据工作需要和翻译人员的个人条件，让他们学习专业知识和技术，或转送专业院校学习。这个问题也需要有关业务部门研究解决。
    第三是加强培养外文干部的工作。今后要培养语种更多的外语干部，每种语文，根据实际需要，定出招生人数。这几年来，西方语文以及应用范围较广的一些东方语文干部培养得太少，应适当增加。语文干部的培养，不仅应注意数量，更重要的是要保证一定的质量。外语院系的学习时间应适当延长，并派一部分外语学生到各国去留学深造。外语院系今后要强调基础外语的教学，重视实际运用语言能力的训练，为培养师资和翻译人材而努力。应逐步提高中等学校外语基础，为大专院校外语专业准备条件。某些业务单位自办的外语学校和训练班，应该适当调整和合并，使外语教学人材得到合理使用，并提高教学质量。
    第四是加强翻译出版工作。除马克思列宁主义经典著作及与之有关的重要理论著作外，在科学技术和文学艺术方面，应该选择水平较高并对我国经济文化建设极有裨益的外文作品来翻译。决不能不加选择地见到外文作品就翻，也不能不问译文质量好坏，收到了译稿就出版。某些出版社出书较滥、译文质量低劣的现象，必须纠正。现有的专业翻译机构应当加强和适当调整，吸收优秀的外文干部参加翻译，采取必要措施培养新生力量。有关的出版社现在已经注意了哲学、社会科学和自然科学等各个领域内世界名著的翻译出版，并正在制定较长期的规划，着手广泛地组织各方面的专家来翻译，这是一件很重要的事情。不仅应该重视有计划地翻译古典的名著，而且应该重视当前世界各国有价值的学术著作的出版，而及时地加以介绍和翻译。应该鼓励高等学校和科学研究机关以及一切能够翻译这些著作的专家担任这种翻译工作。提倡翻译者对自己译文严格认真的风气，做到既忠实于原作，而译文又畅达易晓，使翻译书刊在读者中间获得更高的威信。
    重视和加强翻译工作是我国建设事业中的一项重要任务。翻译工作中存在的问题，必须引起各方面的注意，迅速合理地加以解决。
