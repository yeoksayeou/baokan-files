    Let More People Understand the Law
    Many Regions Carry Out Legal Publicity Activities

    (Our report) People's courts, judicial administrative departments, and lawyer organizations in many parts of the country are actively carrying out legal publicity activities. In addition to conducting legal education for the masses in connection with their work, they also send people to give legal lectures in government agencies, organizations, schools, industrial and mining enterprises, and among residents. According to incomplete statistics from more than 80 county and city courts, judicial bureaus, and lawyer organizations in Jiangsu Province, more than 1,200 legal lectures have been given in the past year, with more than 568,000 listeners. They also organize people's assessors and mediation committee members to carry out legal publicity work among the masses, reflect and report on the situation of judicial activities through newspapers and radio stations, and compile popular pamphlets. Some city courts and judicial administrative departments have held judicial exhibitions. The judicial exhibition held by the Yangtze River Water Transportation Court was attended by more than 5,000 people. The judicial organs in some places have set up publicity columns on the streets and posted pictures of relevant cases.

    Through legal publicity activities, all regions have improved the people's legal knowledge and awareness of law-abiding behavior, reduced civil disputes, and played an active role in preventing crime. In the past, some district and township cadres in Baojing County, Hunan Province, violated laws and regulations and beat and scolded the masses. After the court conducted law-abiding education, such phenomena no longer occurred. After the Hushih People's Court of Putian County, Fujian Province, sent people to give lectures on opposing corruption and theft at the local woodworking production cooperative, two members voluntarily confessed their corrupt behavior. Because legal publicity has greatly helped actual work, some township and community cadres and county agencies and enterprises have requested the court to send people to give legal lectures. Some agricultural cooperatives in Jiangxi and Hebei provinces have established fixed contacts with local people's courts, and the courts regularly send people to the agricultural cooperatives to give lectures in rotation.

    At present, some regions still have shortcomings in legal publicity work, such as being infrequent, not extensive, and not in-depth. They are trying to gradually improve. (Li Daguang)

    让更多的人懂得法律
    许多地区开展法律宣传活动
    本报讯　全国各地许多人民法院、司法行政部门和律师组织，积极开展法律宣传活动，除结合工作向群众进行守法教育外，还派人到机关、团体、学校、工矿企业及居民群众中作法律讲演。据江苏省八十多个县、市法院、司法局和律师组织的不完全统计：一年来共进行法律讲演一千二百多次，听众有五十六万八千多人。他们还组织人民陪审员和调解委员在群众中进行法律宣传工作，通过报刊和广播电台反映和报道司法活动的情况，编写通俗小册子。有些城市的法院和司法行政部门举办了司法展览会。长江水上运输法院举办的司法展览会，观众有五千多人。有的地方的司法机关在街头设置了宣传栏，张贴有关案件的图片。
    各地通过法律宣传活动，提高了人民群众的法律知识和守法观念，减少了民事纠纷，对预防犯罪也起了积极的作用。湖南省保靖县过去有的区乡干部违法乱纪、打骂群众，经过法院进行守法教育以后，这类现象没有再发生。福建省莆田县笏石人民法庭派人到当地木器生产合作社作了反对贪污、盗窃的讲演后，有两个社员自动坦白了他们的贪污行为。由于法律宣传给实际工作有很大帮助，有些乡、社干部和县的机关、企业，都纷纷要求法院派人去作法律讲演；江西、河北省有些农业社和当地人民法院已经建立了固定的联系，法院经常派人到农业社轮流讲演。
    目前，有些地区在法律宣传工作中还存在不经常、不广泛、不深入等缺点，他们正在设法逐步改进。　（李大光）
