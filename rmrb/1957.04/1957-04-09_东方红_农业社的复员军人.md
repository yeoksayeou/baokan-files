    Demobilized Soldiers of the "East is Red" Agricultural Cooperative
    Wang Yuan
    To understand the work and living conditions of demobilized soldiers in rural areas, I recently went to the "East is Red" Agricultural Production Cooperative, located fifty li northeast of Shunyi County in Hebei Province. The cooperative's vice director, Kong Xianku, a jovial old man, stroked his white beard and said with a smile, "The achievements of our large cooperative so far are primarily due to the efforts of the demobilized comrades. We have a total of one hundred and seventeen demobilized soldiers in our cooperative, and over one hundred and ten of them are Party members or Youth League members. While I can't say that every single one is outstanding, nine out of ten are heroes. If you want an introduction, you have to start with our cooperative director, Comrade Xiao Yongshun.”

    First, Director Xiao
    "Director Xiao is from 'Jiaozhuanghu' in our township. He started doing manual labor at a young age. He joined the army in 1948 and was demobilized in 1952. After being tempered in the army for these years, he has gained many abilities: he can write and calculate, his stance is firm, and he has leadership skills. Our cooperative consists of twelve villages, over two thousand eight hundred households, and more than thirteen thousand people, making it the largest cooperative in the county. Managing such a large enterprise is not easy. As for achievements? There really are some. Last year, which was the first year of running the large cooperative, our cooperative's more than forty-seven thousand mu of land, despite suffering from some floods and hailstorms, still increased production by an average of twenty-one jin and twelve liang per mu compared to the previous year. Everyone's lives are better than in previous years, the enthusiasm for production is even greater, and the cooperative cadres are united like one person. Speaking of the cooperative director, everyone sincerely says 'good' from the bottom of their hearts.”

    “Director Xiao never complains about his work and has always maintained a thrifty approach to running the cooperative. In the past, when he was running a small cooperative, some young people suggested to him: ‘Our cooperative members are running around all day, let's buy two bicycles!’ He said: ‘Let's not buy things that are not urgently needed. Good days will come slowly. In the future, we will even ride in cars!’ He is still like this when running the large cooperative. Someone suggested at a meeting: ‘The large cooperative's office location and office supplies should be more presentable.’ Director Xiao disagreed, saying, ‘It's enough to make do to handle the cooperative's affairs. Now is not the time to show off.’ Currently, our large cooperative's office is a rented old house from a cooperative member, and the furniture is pieced together and repaired for use, saving more than one thousand five hundred yuan, but the cooperative's affairs have not been handled badly in the past year. Director Xiao is not stingy, but he considers what should be done. For example, Jiaozhuanghu Primary School was newly built on the foundation of a wall that had been burned into a slope of white earth by the enemy. Not counting materials, the labor alone cost more than ninety yuan. New walls were built around it, and it was plastered with white lime, making it look very presentable. At that time, many people said: ‘Striving for socialism is for the happiness of the next generation, and children should have a good place to study.’ Director Xiao strongly agreed with this view and took an active lead in repairing the school.”

    The Most Active People
    "Among the demobilized construction soldiers in the cooperative, many work actively. For example, Hu Hanrong, who returned after demobilization in 1954 and served as a Party branch committee member in the village, became the leader of the youth production team after the large cooperative was established. Last year, their team's 'intercropping of cotton and wheat' achieved the best results in increasing production. In December, he represented the entire team at the county's advanced producer representative meeting and received a prize banner. Another example is Ma Guolin, who returned after demobilization in 1952 and is a production team leader in Jiaozhuanghu. Although he is a third-class disabled veteran, he is the most active person in agricultural labor. In 1956, he earned more than two thousand four hundred work points for the whole year, which was the highest labor income in the cooperative. Nowadays, girls love young men who are hardworking, do good work, and have good tempers. Marrying a demobilized soldier who has been wounded and fought in battles is even more honorable. Therefore, through introductions, Comrade Ma Guolin smoothly found a good partner and got married in December last year. Of the more than one hundred demobilized soldiers who returned, there were originally thirty-six bachelors, but now only a few remain - five or six are still unmarried, and they will all be settling down this year or next year."

    "The enthusiasm of the demobilized soldiers is not only reflected in their hard work and good work, but also in upholding principles and safeguarding the interests of the entire cooperative. For example, Yan Zhaoxiang from Qilianzhuang is a Party member with a strong fighting spirit. When he sees things that are not in line with the collective interest, he dares to criticize and expose them. Last summer, some cadres secretly sold sweet potato seedlings, causing some losses to the cooperative's production. The cooperative members in the village were afraid of retaliation and being attacked, so they did not report it, and this bad thing was kept secret. After Yan Zhaoxiang learned about it, he had no hesitation and reported the matter to the cooperative. Although he suffered some attacks at the beginning, he persisted in fighting to the end and finally helped the cooperative clarify the problem and make a fair decision. Another example is Kou Kejian from Dabeiwu Village, who obeyed the cooperative's allocation and took care of the cooperative last summer, going out to work with more than fifty cooperative members for half a year. When they were paid and returned home, the local work unit had instructed that 5% of the wages should be used as public accumulation funds, and each person should bring it back and hand it over to the cooperative. On the way back, someone said: ‘The cooperative doesn't know about this, so let's not hand it over.’ He said: ‘We take the cooperative as our home, and it's not right not to hand it over.’ After returning, he took the initiative to find the cooperative and handed over the ten yuan of public accumulation funds from his wages to the cooperative. Under his influence, coupled with the cooperative's mobilization, the cooperative members who went with him also handed over the public accumulation funds."

    Any Skills Can Be Used
    "In the past, when the enterprise was small, we did not dare to boast like this, but we tried our best to take care of things. Now that our enterprise is larger, there are more things to be done, and all kinds of work need to be prepared for people to do. Any skills can be used; even if they are not used today, they will be used soon. Take He Xinman as an example. He is not in good health and is not suitable for working in the fields, but he learned how to drive a bulldozer in the army and likes to tinker with machines. We let him and Jiao Kexiang learn how to operate a locomotive boiler, and they have now graduated and returned. Our cooperative is building the Jinjitang small reservoir and needs to install a twenty-five-horsepower locomotive boiler. This machine was shipped here a few days ago, and He Xinman and the others are busy cleaning and maintaining it. The technology he learned has found a use in his hometown, and he himself is very happy."

    "Speaking of repairing Jinjitang, this is a major event we have undertaken since merging into a large cooperative. In the spring of 1956, one thousand of our male and female laborers worked for fifty days and completed the water tank, dry canal, and branch canals. Only the river dam and irrigation ditches were left, and it is planned to use about thirty thousand workdays this spring to complete them, and install the locomotive boiler to draw water for irrigation. The benefits this project brings to our cooperative are really not small. Last year, the water tank and canals were dug, and the benefits were immediately apparent: the flood did not become a disaster, and the riverside land that originally yielded one hundred to two hundred jin of grain yielded six hundred and seventy jin per mu; eight hundred and thirty mu of rice were planted, yielding more than three hundred jin per mu, which was as delicious as Xiaozhan rice. This is really a novelty in our poor mountainous area, which has never produced rice."

    "Greening barren mountains is also a major event that our large cooperative has successfully undertaken. In 1956, we established a nursery with about three hundred thousand saplings and fruit tree seedlings of various types. We have already completed five shelterbelts on the mountain, covering an area of more than three thousand five hundred mu, and the small trees are now one or two chi high. This year and next year, the various seedlings in the nursery will also be moved to the mountain one by one. In another three, five, or ten years, ha! Our area will not be like it is now. With the addition of water conservancy, mechanization, and electrification, it will truly be like the Soviet collective farms seen in movies."

    "So many things need to be done, and we are worried about having too few people, not too many. If you have great skills, you can use them in agricultural construction in your hometown. It is nonsense to say that there is no future in the countryside. The large cooperative has such a good prospect, and everyone will of course have a good future, depending on whether you can do it or not."

    "We are sincerely happy to send batches of young people to join the army every year, and we are even more sincerely happy to welcome batches of demobilized soldiers back home. Because our own army has trained talents for our cooperative, taught them how to live and work, improved their culture, and taught them skills, adding to our capital for building a socialist homeland. We welcome them, which means we need them. We guarantee that we will help them settle down and get appropriate work."

    “东方红”农业社的复员军人
    望远
    为了了解复员军人在农村工作和生活的情况，不久以前，我到了河北省顺义县城东北五十里的“东方红”农业生产合作社。这个社的副主任孔宪库，是个爱说爱笑的老汉，他拈着白胡子笑着告诉我说：“我们这个大社，办到目前这样，复员回来的同志们，是功劳簿上头一名。我们社一共有一百一十七个复员军人，就有一百一十多个党员和团员。虽然不能说个顶个都是好样的，但十个有九个是英雄好汉。要介绍的话，得先从我们的社主任萧永顺同志谈起。
    先说萧主任
    “萧主任是本乡‘焦庄户’人，从小扛长活，1948年参军，1952年复员，在部队锻炼了这几年，本事可大多了：能写能算，立场稳，领导有办法。我们全社十二个村，两千八百多户，一万三千多口子，是全县最大的一个社。当这份家可不容易呀。成绩吗？也真有。去年，也就是办大社的头一年，全社四万七千多亩地，虽然受了些水灾和雹灾，还是每亩平均比前年增产了二十一斤十二两。大家的日子比往年都好过，生产劲头更足了，社干部团结得像一个人似的。说到社主任，真是谁都从心眼里说‘好’。
    “萧主任作工作从来不叫苦，勤俭办社更是一贯的作风。过去他办小社的时候，有些青年向他提议：‘咱们社里人成天东跑西颠的，买两辆自行车吧！’他说：‘先不要买那些不急需的东西吧，好日子慢慢来，将来咱们还坐汽车呢！’到了办大社的时候他还是这样。有人在会议上提出过：‘大社办公地点、办公用具都该像样一点。’萧主任不同意，说：‘能凑合一下办了社里的事就行，现在还不是耍排场的时候。’眼下我们的大社办公室是向社员租的一所旧房子，家具也是凑凑修修就用了，省下了一千五百多元，可是一年来社里的事办得并不坏。萧主任也不是小气，是考虑该办的就办。比如焦庄户小学，就是在被敌人烧成一坡白地的墙基上新盖起来的，不算料，光工就用了九十多个，周围砌了新墙，抹了白灰，满像样的。当时许多人都说：‘奔社会主义，就是为下一代的幸福，该让孩子们有个好地方学习。’萧主任很同意这种意见，而且在修校当中积极带头。
    最积极的人们
    “全社复员建设军人当中，积极工作的很多。比如胡汉荣，1954年复员回来担任村里的党支部委员，办起大社后就当了青年生产队的队长。去年他们队‘棉麦间作’，增产成绩最好，12月里他代表全队参加了全县先进生产者代表会议，得了奖旗。再如马国林，1952年复员回来的，是焦庄户的一个生产组长。虽然是三等乙级残废，但在农业劳动当中却是最积极的人。1956年他全年得了二千四百多个工分，是全社劳动收入最多的。现在的姑娘最爱劳动好、工作好、脾气好的小伙子，嫁个负过伤、作过战的复员军人，更觉得光荣。所以马国林同志经人介绍，很顺利地找了个好对象，去年12月结了婚。回来的这百多个复员军人，原来共有三十六个光棍汉，现在只剩了零头——五、六个没结婚的了，今年明年也都要成起家来。
    “复员军人的积极，不仅表现在劳动好、工作好这上面，也表现在坚持原则、维护全社利益上。比如七连庄的阎兆祥，就是个斗争性挺强的党员，看到不合乎集体利益的事，敢批评，敢揭发。去年夏天，有些干部偷卖地瓜秧子，使大社生产受了些损失。本村社员们都怕受报复、受打击，不敢反映，所以这种坏事一直瞒着。阎兆祥知道以后，毫无顾虑，向大社揭发了这件事，开头虽然受了些打击，可是他坚持斗争到底，终于帮着大社把问题弄清楚，作了公正处理。再如大北务村的寇克俭，去年夏天听从大社分配、照顾，和五十多个社员一起出外作了半年工。发工资回家的时候，当地工作单位有过交代，说工资当中有5％作公积金，各人带回来交给社里。回来的路上，有人说：‘大社不知道有这么回事，咱们不交算了。’他就说：‘咱们是以社为家，不交不对。’回来以后，他就主动找到社，把自己工资中的十元公积金交给社里。在他的影响下，加上社的动员，同去的社员也都把公积金交给社了。
    有什么本事都用得着
    “过去家业小，我们不敢夸这个海口，只是尽量照顾就是了。现在我们家业大了，要干的事多了，各种各样的工作都得准备下人去做，有什么本事都用得上；即使今天用不上，不久也会用得上。就说何新满吧，身体不太好，不适合下地劳动，但他在部队上学过开推土机，也喜欢摆弄机器，我们就让他和焦克祥去学开锅驼机，现在已经毕业回来。我们社正修金鸡塘小型水库，要安一架二十五马力的锅驼机，这架机器前两天已经运来了，何新满他们正忙着收拾、保养。他学的一些技术，在家乡找到了用场，他自己也很高兴。
    “说到修金鸡塘，这是我们并大社以后办的一件大事。1956年春天，我们一千个男女劳动力，干了五十天，把水柜、干渠、支渠都修成了，只剩了拦河坝和浇地用的斗渠、毛渠，计划今年春天再用三万上下的工就可修成，安上锅驼机就能抽水浇地了。这个工程给我们社带来的利益实在不小。去年挖成了水柜、水渠，好处马上就有了：大水没有成灾，原来打一百斤到二百斤粮食的沿河地，产量到了每亩六百七十斤；种了八百三十亩稻子，每亩打三百多斤，好吃得像小站稻一样。这在我们这向来不出稻子的穷山区来说，可实在是个新鲜事。
    “绿化荒山也是我们大社办得有成绩的一件大事。1956年我们建立了一个苗圃，共有各种树秧子和果树苗三十万棵上下。我们在山上已经完成了五条防护林带，算面积是三千五百多亩，现在小树已经长得一二尺高了。今年明年，苗圃里的各种树苗也都要一样一样搬上山。再过三年、五年、十年，哈！我们这里就不是现在这样了，加上水利、机械化、电气化，真会像在电影上看到的苏联集体农庄一样。
      “这么多事，都得有人干。我们向远处一盘算，就愁人手少，不愁人手多。你有天大的本事，都会在本乡本土的农业建设上使出来。说在农村里没出息，那才是瞎说。大社有这么好的远景，每个人当然也会有好的前途，就看你干得了干不了。
    “我们是真心乐意每年把一批批的小青年送去入伍，更真心乐意欢迎一批批的复员军人回家来。因为自己的军队给我们社训练出了人才，教会了他们怎么生活、怎么劳动，提高了文化，学会了本事，给我们添了建设社会主义家园的老本钱。我们欢迎他们，也就是说需要他们。我们打保票，要帮他们安家立业，得到适当的工作。”
