    Participating in Agricultural Production is a Glorious Path
    Xie Chengren, Teacher at Beijing No. 1 High School

    Once, I asked a junior middle school student what he planned to do after graduation. He said very frankly: "Go on to higher education. If I can't get into higher education, then find a job. Anything will do, but I don't want to go to the countryside." It turned out that he thought going to the countryside to work was not promising, he was afraid of being looked down upon, and afraid that he would have no future development. Although this student's words cannot represent the opinions of all primary and secondary school graduates, they do reflect the psychology of some people to a certain extent.

    In the past, our countryside was in a state of poverty and backwardness for a long time. After liberation, the peasants were allocated land and further organized into agricultural production cooperatives, and were moving towards the road to prosperity; but until now, our countryside has not fundamentally changed the situation of lacking science and culture. If thousands upon thousands of primary and secondary school educated youth return to the countryside after graduation, participate in agricultural production, and use the scientific knowledge they have learned to change the backward cultural outlook of the countryside, what meaningful work this will be! Is this not promising?

    No one can imagine what our countryside will look like in a few decades; but I dare to assert that any agricultural production cooperative very far away from Beijing will become a beautiful "rural city" in the future. In this "rural city," there will be well-managed welfare undertakings, various modern means of transportation, advanced medical and health equipment and cultural and educational organizations... Every farmer will have a higher level of culture and be able to master the latest agricultural technology. This is not a dream, but an ideal we must realize. We are willing to be "the first generation of cultured and advanced farmers in the motherland," using our labor to make the countryside of the motherland more prosperous and beautiful. We are confident that this is the right thing to do, and it is in the interests of the motherland, so who dares to look down on us?

    The socialist cause is the most promising cause. Think about it, students, we are participating in agricultural production precisely to enable our country to move towards socialism rapidly. Since our entire country has a future, how can we individuals have no future? Going to high school, going to university, and becoming a cadre certainly have a future, and participating in the labor production army also has a future, because in our country whether a person is respected does not depend on what job he or she holds, but on whether he or she is loyal to the country and the people, and whether he or she has contributed his or her greatest labor to the country and the people. On April 8, the "People's Daily" published an editorial "On the Issue of Primary and Secondary School Graduates Participating in Agricultural Production," which pointed out a clear direction for us educated youth. The country calls on us, "Young people must have ideals." Students, let us use our own hands to build thousands upon thousands of new-style farms on the land of the motherland!

    参加农业生产是一条光荣的道路
    北京市第一中学教员　谢承仁
    有一次，我问一个初三同学，问他毕业后打算做什么，他很坦率地说：“升学。如果升不上学就找工作。做什么都成，就是不愿意到农村。”原来他认为到农村就业是没有出息，怕被人瞧不起，怕日后自己没有发展前途。这个同学的话虽然不能代表所有中小学毕业生的意见，但是多少是反映了部分人的心理的。
    过去，我国农村是长期处在贫穷落后的状态。解放后，农民分得了土地，并且进一步组织起来，成立了农业生产合作社，正向着富裕的道路前进；但是直到如今，我们的农村还没有根本改变缺乏科学和文化的状况。如果成千成万的中小学知识青年毕业后，回到农村，参加农业生产，用自己学到的科学知识，去改变农村文化落后的面貌，这将是多么有意义的工作啊！难道这样做是没有出息吗？
    几十年后，我们的农村将会进步成一个什么样子，谁也无法想像；不过敢断言，将来任何一个离开北京非常遥远的农业生产合作社，都会变成一个美丽的“乡村城市”。在这个“乡村城市”里，有办理完善的福利事业，有各种现代化的交通工具，有先进的医疗卫生设备和文化教育组织……每个农民都有较高的文化，都能掌握最新的农业技术。这并不是梦想，而是我们必须要实现的理想。我们愿意做“祖国第一代有文化的先进农民”，用自己的劳动，来使祖国的农村变得更加富饶美丽。我们自信这样做是对的，是符合祖国利益的，那么谁敢瞧不起我们？
    社会主义事业是最有前途的事业，同学们试想想，我们参加农业生产，正是为了使我们国家迅速走向社会主义，既然我们整个国家有前途，怎么会我们个人没有前途呢？升高中升大学当干部固然有前途，参加劳动生产大军同样也有前途，因为在我们国家一个人是否受人尊敬，不决定于他在什么工作岗位，而决定于他是否对国家和人民忠诚，是否为国家和人民贡献了他最大的劳动。4月8日，“人民日报”发表了“关于中小学毕业生参加农业生产问题”的社论，给我们知识青年指出了明确的方向。国家号召我们，“青年人要有理想”，同学们，让我们用自己的双手在祖国的大地上建立起千千万万新式的农庄吧！
