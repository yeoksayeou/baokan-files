Checking Genealogies

There are always many aristocrats who are worthless except for their noble birth. One day, one such aristocrat met Alexandre Dumas, the famous 19th-century French novelist, and actually wanted to inquire about Dumas's family history, tracing his ancestry back to a black man.

"Mr. Dumas, it is said that your father, the general, was a person of mixed race, is that indeed true?"

"Absolutely true, sir!" Dumas replied.

"Then what about your grandfather?"

"Naturally, he was a black man."

"Please forgive me for asking one more question: what about your great-grandfather?"

"He was an ape-man, sir. My family line begins exactly where yours ends."

    查家谱
    除了出身高贵便一无足道的贵族总是很多的。一天，有位这样的贵族遇见了十九世纪法国著名的小说家亚历山大·仲马，竟想盘问一下仲马的家世，追索出他的祖先是个黑人。
    “仲马先生，据说您的父亲，那位将军，是个混血种，这话确实么？”
    “完全确实，我的先生！”仲马回答说。
    “那末您的祖父呢？”
    “自然是个黑人呀。”
    “请原谅我再问一声：您的曾祖父呢？”
    “他是猿人哩，我的先生。我家的祖系正是从您家祖系终结的地方开始的呀。”
