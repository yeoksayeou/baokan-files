"Today's Romania" Chinese Magazine Launched

    This newspaper reports that the Chinese pictorial "Today's Romania" has recently been launched in Bucharest. The pictorial is published monthly and is a flower of friendship cultivated through the close cooperation of Romanian comrades and Chinese workers, teachers, and students in Romania. This is the first time that such a journal has been published in Chinese in Romania.
    "Today's Romania" is a comprehensive pictorial publication with both pictures and text. Its main task is to introduce to Chinese readers the achievements of the Romanian people in building socialism and their living conditions. In its inaugural issue, readers will see the blue Danube. Professor Paul's article entitled "Conquering the Iron Gate" describes the grand prospects of developing the Danube's water resources and expanding Danube navigation. Under the title "A Day in Family Life," the pictorial vividly introduces the daily life of a railway worker with photos and text. A set of sketches entitled "Impressions of the People's Republic of China" are illustrations made by National Prize winner Tatu for the short story collection "Neighbors" by the writer Grang, both of whom have visited our country. In addition, readers can also see the majestic Carpathian Mountains and the face of the ancient and young city of Constanța in this issue of the pictorial.
    The launch of "Today's Romania" pictorial is a new contribution to enhancing understanding between the Chinese and Romanian people and strengthening Sino-Romanian friendship. (Attached picture)

    本报讯　中文的“今日罗马尼亚”画报最近在布加勒斯特创刊。画刊每月出版一期，它是由罗马尼亚同志和中国在罗马尼亚的工人、教师、留学生的密切合作下栽培起来的一朵友谊之花。用中文出版这样的期刊，在罗马尼亚还是第一次。
      “今日罗马尼亚”画刊是个图文并茂的综合性刊物，它的主要任务是向中国读者介绍罗马尼亚人民建设社会主义的成就和他们的生活情况。在它的创刊号上，读者将会看到蓝色的多瑙河。保尔教授的题为“征服铁门”的文章里描述了开发多瑙河水力资源、发展多瑙河航运的宏伟前景。画刊在“家庭生活里的一天”的标题下，用照片和文字生动地介绍了一位铁路工人一天的生活。以“中华人民共和国印象”为题的一组速写画，是国家奖金获得者塔鲁为作家格朗的短篇小说集“邻居”作的插图，他们都曾访问过我国。此外，读者还能在这期画刊里看到喀尔巴阡山的雄姿、古老而年轻的康斯坦查城的面貌。
    “今日罗马尼亚”画报的创办，对于增进中罗两国人民的了解和加强中罗友谊是一个新的贡献。（附图片）
