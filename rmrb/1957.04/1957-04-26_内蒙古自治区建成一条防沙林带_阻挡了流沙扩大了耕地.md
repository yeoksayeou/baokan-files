    Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, April 24th. A sandbreak forest belt, 308 *li* long, has been built at the juncture of the Tengger Desert in Alxa League, Bayannur, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and Dengkou County. The forest belt stretches from Nanliangtai in Dengkou County in the south to Xiaxizhaizi, where the county borders Hanggin Rear Banner, with an average width of 70 meters.
    This forest belt was created by the people of all ethnic groups in Dengkou County through more than seven years of hard work. The afforestation area totals more than 43,000 *mu*, with over 12 million surviving trees, including poplar, willow, sand dates, and elm. In desert areas close to farmland, people have used methods such as building brushwood dams, diverting water to irrigate the sand, closing off the sand to cultivate seedlings, and planting grasses and shrubs suitable for growing in the desert, thus fixing or semi-fixing a portion of the shifting sand.
    Dengkou County is bordered by the Yellow River to the east and the boundless Tengger Desert to the west. The county is also located at the gap between the Helan and Lang Mountains. Every spring, during the windy season, shifting sand moves forward an average of 20 meters, encroaching on many fertile fields, filling up canals, burying farmers' houses, and even entire villages. After liberation, the Party and the People's Government attached great importance to this issue and began to lead the people of all ethnic groups in the county in a planned fight against the wind and sand in 1950. As a result of years of afforestation, not only can shifting sand no longer encroach on farmland, but the cultivated land area has also expanded. The county has expanded its cultivated land area by 70,000 *mu* from 1950 to the present, most of which is barren land near the desert that was previously difficult to cultivate. (Attached picture)

### 内蒙古自治区建成一条防沙林带  阻挡了流沙扩大了耕地

    内蒙古自治区建成一条防沙林带
    阻挡了流沙扩大了耕地
    新华社呼和浩特24日电　内蒙古自治区巴彦淖尔盟阿拉善旗腾格里大沙漠同磴口县交界处，已建成一条长三百零八里的防沙林带。林带南由磴口县的南粮台起，北到这个县同杭锦后旗接壤的下西闸子，平均宽七十公尺。
    这条林带是磴口县各族人民经过七年多的努力营造成的。造林面积共四万三千多亩，现已成活杨、柳、沙枣、榆等树一千二百多万株。在靠近农田的沙漠地区，人们用筑柴坝，引水灌沙，封沙育苗和种植适宜于沙漠中生长的草和灌木，已把一部分流沙固定或半固定下来。
    磴口县东临黄河，西面是一望无际的腾格里大沙漠，全县又正当贺兰山和狼山的缺口处，每年春天风季，流沙平均要向前移动二十公尺，侵占了许多良田，填平了渠道，埋没了农民的房舍，甚至整个村庄。解放后，党和人民政府对这问题就很重视，从1950年开始，就有计划地领导全县各族人民向风沙展开斗争。连年造林的结果，不仅流沙再无法侵占农田，而且耕地面积也扩大了。全县从1950年到现在扩大耕地面积七万亩，其中绝大部分都是靠近沙漠过去不好种的荒地。（附图片）
