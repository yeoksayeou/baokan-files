The "Collected Works of Guo Moruo," edited by the People's Literature Publishing House and personally proofread by the author, began publication in the second quarter of this year. Volumes One to Four have now been released to Xinhua Bookstore for distribution, and Volume Five is scheduled for publication in May.

Guo Moruo's works cover a wide range of fields, and there are numerous editions of various collections and single volumes personally compiled by the author or edited by publishers over the years. The general readership has long requested the publication of a complete collection of his works. In 1943, during the celebration of Guo's 25th anniversary of creative life held in Chongqing, friends in Chongqing compiled a "Catalog of Guo Moruo's Works" to prepare for the publication of a complete collection, but this plan was never realized. The "Collected Works of Guo Moruo" now being edited and published aims to collect the author's poems, plays, novels, autobiographical novels, essays, sketches, miscellaneous essays, literary essays, and academic works from around forty years since the author published his first novel "Shepherd's Lament" (New China Magazine, Issue 7, 1918) and short poem "The Temptation of Death." Except for the parts that were deleted by the author during the compilation of this "Collected Works" and some materials that could not be found, almost all of his works are included.

Volumes One and Two of the "Collected Works" contain the poetry part of the author's creations. Except for a few adjustments, they are arranged chronologically according to the compilation of the first editions of the poetry collections. The author's first poetry collection, "The Goddesses," was published in 1921 and contains poems written from 1918 to 1921, including three poetic dramas and fifty-three lyric poems. This poetry collection embodies the spirit of the times around the May Fourth Movement. Its publication caused a huge shock in the literary world at the time and had a profound impact on subsequent new poetry creations. Subsequently, in 1923, the second collection of poetry and prose, "Starry Sky," was published, containing thirty-two new poems and several dramas and prose works. Later published poetry collections include "Vase" (long poem, 1927), "Avant-Garde" (poetry collection, 1928), "Recovery" (1928), "War Songs" (1938), "Cicada Songs" (1948), and "Ode to New China" (1953). In addition to collecting the above collections, this "Collected Works" is compiled into two series of "Extra-Collection": one is based on the 1928 edition of "Guo Moruo's Poetry Collection" and the 1947 "Phoenix" collections, collecting poems not included in each collection; the other is a collection of new works published in various newspapers and periodicals after "Ode to New China" up to January 1957. In Volume Two of this "Collected Works," the initial "Book of Songs" translation "Juan'er Collection" published in 1923 and the "Qu Yuan's Fu Translations" published in 1953 are also included. Therefore, these two volumes almost include all of the author's poetry works. Not only can one trace the author's poetry creation process from here, but also, through these poems, the ideological, living, and political struggle path of an era we have experienced is presented.

Dramatic creation also occupies an extremely important part of the author's creative life. In addition to preserving the initial drama works such as "The Rebirth of the Goddess," "Xiang Lei," "The Flowers of the Pear Tree" (initial draft), "The Two Sons of the Lonely Bamboo Prince," and "Guanghan Palace" in the "Goddesses" and "Starry Sky" collections in Volume One according to the compilation of the first editions, the "Collected Works" also includes eight plays in Volumes Three and Four. Only "Zhuo Wenjun" and "Wang Zhaojun" are works from 1923, which were combined with the second draft of "The Flowers of the Pear Tree," "Nie Ying" (two acts, written in 1925), to form the author's earliest drama collection "Three Rebellious Women" (1926). The other plays "The Flowers of the Pear Tree" (finalized in 1941), "Qu Yuan," "Tiger Tally," "Gao Jianli," "Peacock Gall," and "Nanguan Grass" were all works from 1942-43. Among them, the two plays "The Flowers of the Pear Tree" and "Qu Yuan" can be compared with the initial draft of "Tangdi" and "Xiang Lei" preserved in "The Goddesses" to allow readers to see the development and growth trajectory of a work in the twenty-year writing process.

The four historical dramas "Tiger Tally," "Gao Jianli," "Peacock Gall," and "Nanguan Grass" have all been substantially revised by the author during the compilation of this "Collected Works." In particular, "Tiger Tally" and "Peacock Gall" have undergone significant changes from the original single editions. "Gao Jianli" was originally named "Zhu" and is now changed to its current name.

Volume Five of the "Collected Works" contains the author's medium and short stories. The author's novel creations, besides the long autobiographical novels, have been successively compiled into collections such as "Pagoda" (1926), "Below the Waterline" (1928, collection of novels and essays), "Olive" (1928, collection of novels and essays), "Falling Leaves" (1926, novella), "One Hand" (1928, novella); in addition, "Guo Moruo's Creative Collection" (1928) and "Selected Translations of Guo Moruo" (1928) also included some novel works. Later, most of the novel works were re-edited by the author into the novel collection "Laughter from Underground" (1948) and the novel and essay collection "Embracing Arrows" (1948).

Since these collections did not fully include all the works, and there were overlapping works between each collection, and some collections were mixed compilations of novels and essays, the novel section of Volume Five of the "Collected Works" did not preserve the original compilation. Instead, all the medium and short stories that can be collected now are re-arranged according to the writing dates, and the short stories he wrote on historical themes are compiled into another series, totaling thirty-eight articles, forming one volume.

The above is a general overview of the contents and compilation of the already published and forthcoming "Collected Works of Guo Moruo," Volumes One to Five. The editing work for Volume Six and beyond is still in progress. It is estimated that the compilation of the entire collection will be more than ten volumes. Except for the author's works on epigraphy and oracle bone inscriptions, such as "The Collection of Guanzi Annotations," "Readings on Salt and Iron Discourse," and the collations of ancient books and foreign works translated over the years, it almost includes most of the author's works to date.

### “沫若文集”第一至五卷的内容和编次

    “沫若文集”第一至五卷的内容和编次
    由人民文学出版社编辑、并经作者亲自校阅的“沫若文集”，已于本年第二季度开始出版，现在第一至四卷已交新华书店发行，第五卷也预定在5月间出版。
    郭沫若的著作所涉及的领域相当广泛，历年来由作者亲自编订，或由出版者编辑的各种集子和单行本，版本也很繁复。广大读者好久以来就有出版全部文集的要求，在1943年于重庆举行郭氏创作生活二十五周年纪念时，当时在重庆的友人们，曾编订了“沫若著作编目”，作出版文集的准备工作，但这个计划一直没有实现。现在编辑和出版的“沫若文集”，准备收辑从1918年作者发表第一篇小说“牧羊哀话”（1918年新中国杂志第七期）及短诗“死的诱惑”以后约四十年中作者的诗、戏剧、小说、自传小说、散文、小品、杂文、文艺论文、学术著作等作品，除了在这次编订“文集”时经作者自行删削和一部分没有找到资料的以外，已几乎包括了全部的作品。
    “文集”的第一、二卷，收辑作者创作中的诗歌部分，除其中有极个别的调整以外，都是依照初版诗集的编制，按年代编排的。作者的第一个诗集“女神”，出版于1921年，其中收辑从1918到1921年的诗的创作，共计有三个诗剧与五十三首抒情诗。这本诗集蕴含着“五四”前后的时代精神，它的出版曾经给当时文坛以巨大的震动，并对此后的新诗创作留下了深远的影响。接着，于1923年出版了第二个诗歌散文集“星空”，其中收新诗三十二首和几篇戏剧与散文作品。以后陆续出版的诗集，有“瓶”（长诗，1927年），“前茅”（诗集，1928年），“恢复”（1928年），“战声集”（1938年），“蜩螗集”（1948年），“新华颂”（1953年）。本“文集”除了收辑以上各集之外，编成了“集外”二辑：一是根据1928年版的“沫若诗集”和1947年的“凤凰”两集，收辑了各集未收的诗篇；二是“新华颂”以后陆续发表于各地报刊的到1957年1月为止的新作。在本“文集”第二卷中，同时又收入了1923年初版的最初的“诗经”今译“卷耳集”和1953年初版的“屈原赋今译”。因此，这两卷已几乎包括了作者诗作的全部，不仅从这儿可以追迹作者诗歌创作的历程，同时通过这些诗篇，也呈示了我们所经历过来的一个时代的思想、生活与政治斗争的道路。
    戏剧创作同样在作者的创作生活中占据极重要的一部分。“文集”除在第一卷的“女神”与“星空”二集中依照初版的编制保存了“女神的再生”、“湘累”、“棠棣之花”初稿和“孤竹君之二子”、“广寒宫”等最初的戏剧作品之外，并于第三、四两卷中，收辑了八个剧本。其中只有“卓文君”与“王昭君”是1923年的作品，曾和“棠棣之花”的第二次稿“聂嫈”（二幕，1925年作）合编为作者最早的戏剧集“三个叛逆的女性”（1926年）外，其他“棠棣之花”（1941年定稿）、“屈原”、“虎符”、“高渐离”、“孔雀胆”、“南冠草”都是1942—43年的作品，其中“棠棣之花”与“屈原”两剧，更可以从保留在“女神”中的“棠棣”初稿与“湘累”两剧对照着来读，使读者看出一个作品在二十年的写作过程中发展与成长的轨迹。
    “虎符”、“高渐离”、“孔雀胆”、“南冠草”等四个史剧，在这次编订“文集”的时候，都经作者作了较大的修订，特别是“虎符”与“孔雀胆”，已与原来的单行本有很大的改变。“高渐离”原名“筑”，现在改成今名。
      “文集”第五卷收辑了作者的中短篇小说作品。作者的小说创作，除了长篇自传小说之外，曾陆续收编集子的，有“塔”（1926），“水平线下”（1928，小说散文集），“橄榄”（1928，小说散文集），“落叶”（1926，中篇），“一只手”（1928，中篇）；另外还有“沫若创作集”（1928），“沫若译著选”（1928），也收辑了部分小说作品。后来，大部分的小说作品，又由作者重新编订了小说集“地下的笑声”（1948年）和小说散文集“抱箭集”（1948年）。
    由于这些集子都没有完全收入全部的作品，同时各集之间的作品，有互相重出的，而且有些集子是把小说与散文混合编成的，因此“文集”第五卷的小说部门，并没有保存原来的编集，而是把现在能够收集到的全部中篇短篇小说，按照写作年代，重新作了编排，并把他所写的历史题材的短篇，另成一辑，这样，合计三十八篇，成为一卷。
    以上是已经出版和即将出版的“沫若文集”第一至五卷的大致的内容和编次。从第六卷以后的编辑工作，现在还在进行中，估计全部文集的编成当在十卷以上，除了作者关于金文、甲骨等考古学的著作、“管子校集”、“盐铁论读本”等古书的校勘和历年翻译的外国作品以外，已大部分包括作者到目前为止的著作。
