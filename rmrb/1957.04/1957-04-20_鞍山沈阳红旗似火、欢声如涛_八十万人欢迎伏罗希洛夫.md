Xinhua News Agency, April 19th: Chairman Voroshilov and the Soviet guests accompanying him visited Anshan and other places by special plane today.

Vice Chairman Zhu De, Vice Premier He Long, Director of the State Technology Commission Huang Jing, Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Liu Xiao, and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei accompanied the distinguished guests on their visits.

Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premiers Peng Dehuai and Deng Xiaoping, Vice Chairmen Li Jishen and Peng Zhen, Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs Wang Jiaxiang and Zhang Hanfu, and officials from the Soviet Embassy in China saw the guests off at the airport.

(Our Anshan dispatch, April 19th) As Chairman Voroshilov's plane was about to land in Anshan, from the window of the plane, one could see a sea of red flags like fire. As soon as the plane landed, the cheers of the masses were heard, like the roaring of the sea, shaking the earth and resounding through the sky. This city, known as the crystallization of Sino-Soviet friendship, had 200,000 citizens lining the streets today to welcome the Soviet guests. In the afternoon, Chairman Voroshilov and his entourage, accompanied by Vice Chairman Zhu and others, visited the Anshan Iron and Steel Seamless Steel Tube Plant. Chairman Voroshilov also spoke to the workers of Anshan's factories and mines.

As soon as Chairman Voroshilov entered the factory gate of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant, he heard the clanging sound of steel pipes colliding. He smiled and said to the factory director, Han Li: "This sound is as beautiful as music." He walked from the pipe rolling workshop to the finishing workshop, repeatedly praising: "This factory is very good, the more I look at it, the happier I am." He said:
"To see a metallurgical factory, one should start from the beginning, one should first look at ironmaking and steelmaking." Seeing that the machines in this factory were all automated, he couldn't help but recall his childhood and said with emotion: "When I was working, I had to do everything by hand, but now everything is done by machines."

When Chairman Voroshilov finished his tour and walked out of the factory building, he met a young female engineer named Wang Jiazheng. He warmly shook her hand and said to her: "I am very happy to see such a young female engineer like you in a Chinese metallurgical factory. You are all very young and doing a great job. Please congratulate the other comrades on my behalf and make greater contributions to the steel industry." At the same time, he also inquired about the situation of the female workers.

A grand welcoming rally was held in the square of the Seamless Steel Tube Plant. More than 10,000 workers gathered here. Yuan Zhen, manager of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, spoke, welcoming the distinguished guests on behalf of all the steel workers and thanking the Soviet elder brother for its selfless assistance. Manager Yuan Zhen said, "Chairman Voroshilov can see here that Soviet aid has blossomed and borne fruit."

Then, Chairman Voroshilov spoke enthusiastically in the cheers (see page 4).

Vice Chairman Zhu De told the workers that the development of Anshan's iron and steel industry is inseparable from the sincere and selfless great assistance of the Soviet Union.

After receiving a gift from Anshan Iron and Steel, Chairman Voroshilov excitedly spoke to the workers again. He said: "You are all workers in steel factories, and I used to work in metallurgical factories as well. Our friendship is heartfelt, it is a true workers' friendship, a brotherly friendship. Please allow me to extend my greetings to you on behalf of the Soviet workers, please allow me to extend my greetings to you on behalf of the Soviet peasants, because many of you are new workers from peasant backgrounds, and I represent the Soviet workers to shake the hands of the Chinese workers tightly." His words once again aroused a storm of cheers and applause.

(Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, April 19th) Chairman Voroshilov and the Soviet guests accompanying him arrived in Shenyang by special plane at 5:05 pm today from Anshan.

Today, the entire city of Shenyang was hung with national flags. From Dongta Airport to the Liaoning Hotel, a distance of about 19 li, the streets were crowded with people, and the entire street was decorated with colorful archways, colorful flags, and slogans. More than 600,000 welcoming people, dressed in colorful spring clothes, filled the entire street. They held Chinese and Soviet national flags, colorful flags, and flowers, lining the streets to welcome the distinguished guests.

At Dongta Airport, more than 15,000 welcoming people gathered here to greet the distinguished guests.

When the plane came to a stop, Vice Chairman Zhu De accompanied Chairman Voroshilov as he appeared at the door of the cabin, cheers and the sound of gongs and drums resounded throughout the airport.

Chairman Voroshilov stepped off the plane and was welcomed by Du Zheheng, Governor of Liaoning Province, Huang Oudong, First Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, General Deng Hua, Commander of the Shenyang Garrison, Liu Baotian, Mayor of Shenyang, Jiao Ruoyu, First Secretary of the Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and people from all walks of life.

As the car drove into the square in front of the Liaoning Hotel, tens of thousands of people who had been waiting here for a long time cheered enthusiastically. After Chairman Voroshilov entered the Liaoning Hotel, he went to the balcony on the second floor and waved his hat to the welcoming crowd in the square. At this time, the welcoming crowd shouted slogans such as "Long live Sino-Soviet friendship" and wished Chairman Voroshilov good night.

    本报鞍山19日电　当伏罗希洛夫主席乘坐的飞机快要在鞍山市着陆的时候，从飞机的窗口往下看，只见一片红旗似火；当飞机刚着陆，就听见群众欢呼的声音如同海涛呼啸，震天动地，响彻云霄。这个被称为中苏友谊结晶的城市，今天有二十万市民夹道欢迎苏联贵宾。下午，伏罗希洛夫主席和随行人员，由朱副主席等陪同参观了鞍钢无缝钢管厂。伏罗希洛夫主席并对鞍山各厂矿企业的职工讲了话。
    伏罗希洛夫主席刚走进无缝钢管厂的厂门，听到了铿锵的钢管撞击声。他含笑向厂长寒力说：“这声音有如音乐一样美妙。”他从轧管车间走到精整车间，连声称赞：“这个工厂很好，越看越高兴。”他说：
  “要看冶金工厂，应该从头看起，应该先看一看炼铁和炼钢。”他看到这个厂的机器都是自动化，不禁想起了自己的童年，感慨地说：“我做工的时候，干活还得用手，现在都用机器了。”
    伏罗希洛夫主席参观完毕走出厂房时，碰到一位年青的女工程师汪家铮。他热情地同她握手，对她说：“在中国冶金工厂看到你这样年青的女工程师非常高兴。你们都很年青，工作很好，请你代我向其他的同志祝贺，在钢铁事业中做出更大的贡献。”同时他还询问了女工的情况。
    盛大的欢迎会在无缝钢管厂的广场上举行。这里聚集了一万多职工。鞍山钢铁公司经理袁振讲话，他代表全体钢铁工人欢迎贵宾的到来，并感谢苏联老大哥的无私援助。袁振经理说，“伏罗希洛夫主席可以在这里看到，苏联的援助已经开花结实。”
    接着，伏罗希洛夫主席在欢呼声中热情地讲了话（见第四版）。
    朱德副主席对工人们说，鞍山钢铁工业的发展是同苏联真诚无私的巨大援助分不开的。
    伏罗希洛夫主席在接受鞍钢的赠礼以后，又十分兴奋地向工人们讲了一番话。他说：“你们都是钢铁工厂的工人，我过去也曾经在冶金工厂工作过，我们的友情是心心相印的，是真正工人的友情，是兄弟般的友情。请允许我代表苏联工人向你们问候，请允许我代表苏联的农民向你们问候，因为你们中间有许多农民出身的新工人，我代表苏联工人紧紧地握中国工人的手。”他的这一番话再一次激起暴风雨般的欢呼和掌声。
    据新华社沈阳19日电　伏罗希洛夫主席和同来的苏联贵宾们，在今天下午五时五分由鞍山乘专机到达沈阳。
