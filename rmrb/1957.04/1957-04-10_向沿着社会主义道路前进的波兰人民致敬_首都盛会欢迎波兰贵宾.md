Xinhua News Agency, April 9th. Chairman Cyrankiewicz said to the eight thousand people from all walks of life in Beijing who gathered to welcome the government delegation of the People's Republic of Poland today, that the Polish people will cooperate with the Chinese people to strengthen the unity between socialist countries, to further build socialism and to defend world peace (the full text of the speech is on page four).
    This grand welcoming rally was held in the Beijing Gymnasium.
    At 4:10 PM, Chairman Cyrankiewicz and his wife, along with other distinguished Polish guests, entered the venue accompanied by Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier He Long, Mayor Peng Zhen and his wife. At this moment, the people gathered in the hall stood up and applauded warmly for a long time to express their welcome. A group of young women presented flowers to the distinguished guests.
    In his speech, Chairman Cyrankiewicz also said that as a communist, I am proud because we stand in the same ranks as the first socialist country, the Soviet Union, the various people's democratic countries, and the great China.
    He said that our two countries are following the same path—the path of socialism, and we have formed a fighting alliance, and no force in the world can destroy our alliance.
    He pointed out that the road we are taking is not a road paved with roses, and we also have difficulties to overcome. We thank those friends who criticize us and help us eliminate our shortcomings, but those imperialist blocs that still do not recognize the fact that the formerly oppressed people of Asia and Africa have broken free from their shackles, continue to implement gunboat diplomacy, and feel that it is still the nineteenth century and not the twentieth century are ridiculous. He also said, please don't let those who are trying to maintain the biggest shame of our century—colonialism—in various forms come and teach us a lesson!
    At the beginning of the welcoming rally, Mayor Peng Zhen delivered a welcoming speech (the full text is on page four). He extended his heartfelt welcome and respect on behalf of all the people of Beijing to the Polish government delegation headed by Chairman Cyrankiewicz for their visit to our country. Peng Zhen said that we are very happy for the great achievements made by the Polish people in socialist construction. We Chinese people regard the achievements of the Polish people as our own achievements, as an inseparable part of the achievements of our socialist family. China and Poland are both members of the socialist family, and the common goal of building socialism and communism closely links us together.
    Peng Zhen praised Poland's increasingly important role in international affairs. He expressed his hope that Chairman Cyrankiewicz would take back the Chinese people's deep friendship for the Polish people.
    Mayor Peng Zhen presented a banner to the distinguished guests on behalf of the welcoming rally. The banner read: "The people of all circles in Beijing pay tribute to the Polish people who are advancing along the socialist road! Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Polish people!"
    Chairman Cyrankiewicz's and Mayor Peng Zhen's speeches expressing the friendship between China and Poland were repeatedly met with warm applause from the audience.
    After the welcoming rally, Chinese literary and art workers gave a wonderful artistic performance for the distinguished guests, which also included Polish songs and dances. After the performance, Chairman Cyrankiewicz presented flower baskets to the performers and went to the square to shake hands and thank the performers.
    Also present at today's welcoming rally were Liu Ren, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and other responsible persons, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei, and Chinese Ambassador to Poland Wang Bingnan.

    向沿着社会主义道路前进的波兰人民致敬
    首都盛会欢迎波兰贵宾
    新华社9日讯　西伦凯维兹主席今天对集会欢迎波兰人民共和国政府代表团的八千名北京各界人民说，波兰人民将和中国人民一道，为加强社会主义各国之间的团结，为进一步建设社会主义和保卫世界和平而继续合作（讲话全文见第四版）。
    这个盛大的欢迎会是在北京体育馆中举行的。
    下午四时十分，西伦凯维兹主席和夫人和波兰的其他贵宾们由周恩来总理、贺龙副总理、彭真市长和夫人等陪同步入会场。这时候，聚集在大厅里的人们全体起立，长久地热烈鼓掌表示欢迎。一群女青年向贵宾们献了鲜花。
    西伦凯维兹主席在讲话中还说，作为一个共产主义者，我感到骄傲，因为我们同第一个社会主义国家苏联、各人民民主国家以及伟大的中国站在同一个行列里。
    他说，我们两国走的是相同的道路——社会主义的道路，我们已结成了战斗的联盟，世界上没有任何力量能够破坏我们的联盟。
    他指出，我们所走的道路，并不是玫瑰花铺成的道路，我们也有需要克服的困难。我们感谢那些批评我们并帮助我们消除缺点的朋友们，但那些直到今天一直不承认亚洲和非洲的不久以前还受着压迫的人民已经摆脱了桎梏的事实，继续执行大炮政策，觉得现在还是十九世纪而不是二十世纪的帝国主义集团是可笑的。他又说，请那些用各种形式竭力企图保持我们这个世纪的最大耻辱——殖民主义的人不要来教训我们吧！
    在欢迎大会开始的时候，彭真市长致欢迎词（全文见第四版）。他代表北京市全体人民向以西伦凯维兹主席为首的波兰政府代表团来我国访问表示衷心的欢迎和敬意。彭真说，我们为波兰人民在社会主义建设中所取得的巨大成就感到十分高兴。我们中国人民把波兰人民的成就看作是我们自己的成就，看作是我们社会主义国家大家庭的成就的一个不可分割的部分。中、波两国都是社会主义国家大家庭的一员，建设社会主义和共产主义的共同目标把我们紧密地连结在一起。
    彭真赞扬波兰在国际事务中所起的日益重要的作用，他希望西伦凯维兹主席把中国人民对波兰人民的深厚友谊带回去。
    彭真市长代表这个欢迎大会把一面锦旗赠送给贵宾们。锦旗上写着：“北京市各界人民向正在沿着社会主义道路前进的波兰人民致敬！中波两国人民的友谊万岁！”
    西伦凯维兹主席和彭真市长的表达中波两国友谊的讲话，一再博得全场热烈的掌声。
    欢迎大会结束后，中国的文艺工作者们为贵宾们作了精采的艺术表演，其中还表演了波兰的歌舞。表演结束后，西伦凯维兹主席向演员们赠送了花篮，并到广场上同演员们握手致谢。
    出席今天欢迎大会的，还有政协北京市委员会主席刘仁及其他负责人，外交部副部长姬鹏飞，中国驻波兰大使王炳南。（附图片）
