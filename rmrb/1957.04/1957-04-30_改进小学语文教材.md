Editor's Note: On April 23rd, the editorial department of this newspaper invited twelve elementary school educators from Beijing to discuss the issue of elementary school Chinese textbooks. The attendees raised many criticisms and suggestions regarding the current elementary school Chinese textbooks. The main opinions were: elementary school Chinese textbooks have too many long texts, too many new characters, and too deep content; the textbook selection deviates from the actual lives of the country and children; students have an excessive learning burden, and teaching quality is not high. These opinions are beneficial for improving the compilation of elementary school Chinese textbooks in the future. The speeches of everyone are published below (in order of speaking), hoping to attract the attention of the education community.

The following people were invited to attend the symposium:
　　Zheng Yun, Beijing Second Experimental Elementary School
  　Li Yun, Xidan District Houdali Elementary School
  　Zheng Guanghui, Dongsi District Douyacai Elementary School
    Lu Zhang, Dongsi District Xizhongjie Elementary School
  　Du Yifang, Xidan District First Central Elementary School
  　Wu Zhirui, Dongdan District Maxian Hutong Elementary School
    Chen Yungui, Dongdan District Xiangbizi Zhongkeng Elementary School
  　Tong Baolu, Chongwen District Shangsantiao Elementary School
  　Chen Tangdi, Xidan Damucang First Elementary School
    Liu Jifang, Dongsi District First Central Elementary School
  　Wang Baolu, Dongdan District Shijia Hutong Elementary School
  　Xiao Yuyun, Chongwen District Xiasantiao Elementary School

Chinese textbooks have long lessons, many new words, and deep content; there is little time for practice, and what is learned is not easily consolidated; students have too heavy a learning burden. Textbook editors should be closer to reality, closer to teachers, and closer to children.
    Zheng Yun

Generally speaking, the problems with elementary school Chinese textbooks are that the lessons are long, there are many new characters, and the content is deep. The learning burden on children is too heavy, especially for first and second graders, whose physical development is affected after starting school.

In the past, elementary schools taught 700 characters in two years, but now they have to teach 1,500 characters. In the first semester of the first grade, students have to recognize 279 characters and silently write 211 characters; the characters that are not required to be silently written are not explained later. In the second semester, students have to recognize 372 characters, but with the new characters remaining from the first semester and the new characters in the review lessons, the actual number far exceeds this. Characters that have been learned are no longer counted as new characters, and students only see some characters once. Therefore, although they are required to learn 1,500 characters, they cannot consolidate their knowledge and can only recognize about 1,200 characters. The Ministry of Education wants us to create methods to consolidate knowledge, but there is very little time for practice, so how can we consolidate it?

The lessons in the Chinese textbooks are too long. First and second grades have lessons that are hundreds of characters long. For example, the lesson "The Kitten Fishing" has 300 characters, the lesson "Old White-Bearded Man" has more than 900 characters, and the lesson "Forest Elder" has 495 characters, including 16 new characters and 5 new phrases. The lessons in fifth and sixth grades are also too long, with "Huangni Gang" being more than 8,000 characters long, and the shorter ones being 4,000 to 5,000 characters. Because the lessons are long, it takes more than ten minutes for the teacher to read it once in class, and twenty or even thirty minutes for the children to read it once. A class is only 45 minutes long, and reading takes up so much time that students find it boring. Some particularly long lessons cannot be taught completely by the teacher in one class period and must be divided into several teaching periods.

In the first semester of elementary school, students start learning words, such as Chairman Mao, workers, peasants, rice, flour, rice, wheat, etc., and they have to learn nearly 30 words in a week. Some words only appear once and are never seen again. Accumulating vocabulary is meaningless, and it is difficult for children to accept. Some teachers say, "When will we ever repay the debt we owe to the children?"

Many lessons are too literary, too deep, and not suitable for the age characteristics of children, making them difficult to accept. For example, in the second volume of the elementary Chinese textbook, the lesson "Baby Wants to Sleep" says "... the wind doesn't blow, the clouds don't float, the blue sky is quiet, baby, sleep well." This description is very beautiful, but it is difficult for children to understand this natural scene. Similarly, in the book "Harvesting Wheat," it starts by saying, "A large wheat field, stretching as far as the eye can see. The yellow wheat and the blue sky meet in the distance..." Here, the teacher spent a lot of effort explaining, but the children still cannot understand how the yellow wheat can meet the blue sky. Teachers suggest that the long lessons in the higher grades and the more literary materials that are suitable for children's age characteristics and interests can be printed in the back of the textbook as extracurricular reading materials.

Many people have opinions about the current elementary school Chinese textbooks, but in the past, everyone was afraid to express them. The People's Education Publishing House likes to hear good things and does not want to hear opposing opinions. They are unhappy when they hear different opinions.

Editing textbooks is a major event, and I hope that the Ministry of Education can mobilize everyone to participate in this work. There are many good things in our old teaching materials and teaching methods in the past, and there were also some people who were very experienced in compiling teaching materials in the past. We should extract the good things from them and listen to opinions from all sides. We can also solicit opinions from everyone on the teaching syllabus, and don't be afraid of others making suggestions. The editors of the textbooks should be closer to reality, closer to teachers, and closer to children, and should not shut themselves off from the world. Only in this way can we overcome the separation from real life, from the knowledge level of teachers and students, and overcome dogmatism. Giving opinions on teaching materials is so that the knowledge learned by 60 million children can be consolidated without harming their health.

More illustrations should be added to the lessons. The publishing house should reprint the dictionary. It is not good to teach grammar and language separately.
    Lu Zhang

The first-grade lessons are too deep and have too many new words, making it difficult for children to consolidate what they have learned. The words and sentences used in the lessons and exercises are sometimes inconsistent. For example, there is a sentence in the lesson "pink petals," but in the exercise, it is written as "full of pink flowers." The children learn "petals" in the lesson, but pink flowers are used in the exercise. If the teacher doesn't explain it, it is easy for the children to read it wrong. In this way, the new words in the front are just consolidated, and then a similar new word appears, which is difficult for young children. Because they are all seven-year-old children who have just come out of kindergarten, older children know more, so it is not a problem. Therefore, it is suggested that the words and sentences used in the first-grade lessons and exercises should be the same. The current elementary school textbooks do not have the words "Lesson 1," "Lesson 2," etc. written on the front, and it is difficult for children to turn to them. They have to remember them in their minds, so it is suggested that they be added.

Some of the third-grade lessons need to be explained with the help of charts, but some charts cannot be bought anywhere. It is suggested that the publishing house publish some, or print illustrations in the textbooks.

There are too few illustrations in the lessons, and some of the illustrations are not well drawn. It is hoped that the publishing house will match the illustrations with the theme of the lesson or the climax. In this way, students can understand the main content of the lesson through direct observation.

The scope of the lesson content is not wide enough, and it is difficult for teachers to provide extracurricular guidance. Some longer lessons can be attached to the back of the textbook as extracurricular reading materials in order to connect with the courses in the first year of junior high school.

Teachers should teach students how to use the dictionary, but now it is impossible to buy a good dictionary. There is only a four-corner code dictionary, which is not very good either. The Xinhua Dictionary used to be very good, and it is suggested that the publishing house reprint it.

Some simplified characters are really difficult to handle now, adding to the burden on teachers and students. For example, the simplified form of the character "義" is "义". In principle, it is correct to write the character "蟻" in "螞蟻" as "蚁", but if it is not on the simplified character list, we dare not let students write it. The method we are currently adopting is to let students write the simplified characters that are already in the textbooks, and not let them write the ones that are not.

Some of the explanations of word classes are now different from what they used to be. For example, the three characters "慢慢地" used to be explained as adverbs, but now they are said to be adjectives. Another example is the word "人" in "好人". In the past, it was explained as the main component, but now it is explained as the central word, which is also different. I think it is okay to explain it generally, but it is too difficult to grasp the rules.

It is not good to teach grammar and language separately now. There is a saying that grammar is science and language is literature. Don't talk about literature when talking about science, and don't talk about science when talking about literature. For example, if a sentence like "我又一次地紧紧地愉快地握了孩子的手" is difficult for children to understand, we can say: "我" is the subject, and "握手" is the predicate. Students can easily understand. If the grammar is not related to the language class, the students will not easily understand it.

In addition, the school requires students to sit upright and listen to the class, which I don't think is very good. It is too hard for children to attend several classes in a row like this, which affects their learning effect. I suggest that the posture of children can be appropriately changed during class, under the requirement of being able to concentrate on listening to the lecture.

Students should learn to recognize characters from shallow to deep, gradually increasing. There are too many common sense lessons in the third and fourth grades, and too few fairy tales and revolutionary stories.
    Chen Yungui

It is difficult for first and second-grade students to learn 1,500 new characters. In the past, elementary school first and second-grade students were required to learn 700 characters, and at that time, students learned them relatively firmly. Now, they are suddenly required to learn 1,500 characters, which is too much for the children to handle. In fact, students can only learn about 1,300 characters out of these 1,500 characters. In addition, first and second-grade teachers have not done a good job in connecting when teaching new characters, and many characters that have been learned become new characters again in the third grade.

It is not good to let children learn many phrases first, because the children are young and cannot remember so many; secondly, many phrases will not appear again in the subsequent lessons and are not used at all.

The lesson "Big Turnip" in the first semester of the first grade is too long and has too many new words. In order to enable the children to consolidate these words, teachers are worried and try their best to help the children consolidate them, and many parents also help their children review at home, but the effect is not good, and about 30% of the students cannot consolidate all the new words. We believe that children in the first grade should learn to recognize characters from shallow to deep, gradually increasing. It is unreasonable to let such young children learn so many characters, and in fact, it has already affected their physical and mental health.

The four-requirement words in the second-grade textbooks - being able to read, write, speak, and use - are not connected with the first grade. In addition, when the children are promoted from the first grade to the second grade, they also bring many unconsolidated new words. Therefore, when they reach the second grade, the number of new characters increases. In this way, as the years go by and the children's grades increase, the foundation is not well laid, and many new characters, words, and sentences are not well consolidated. When they reach the higher grades, teachers still have to spend a certain amount of time to give the children remedial lessons. Many fifth and sixth-grade teachers complain that the lower-grade teachers did not lay a good foundation for the children. In fact, the lower-grade teachers also have many opinions, and it is really difficult to express them.

There are too many common sense lessons in the third and fourth grades, and too few fairy tales and revolutionary stories. The lessons in the fifth and sixth grades are too deep, but there are very few vivid and rich vocabularies. For example, the lesson "Party Membership Dues" in the sixth grade has a deeper meaning and is not suitable for teaching teenagers. The teaching materials should be combined with the actual needs of the children.

Some lessons are inconsistent in describing the deeds of a good child. For example, in the lesson "Mijia's Five Points," the previous lesson narrates that Mijia corrected his mistakes and became a good child, but in the subsequent lessons, it is said that Mijia has bad behaviors. I think that when a good child appears in the textbook, his good deeds should be prominently written from beginning to end in order to establish a model in the minds of the children and imitate these good children at any time and anywhere. If the actions of a character are inconsistent in several lessons, it is easy to make the children vague and not know what to do.

In the arrangement of depth and difficulty in the fifth and sixth-grade Chinese textbooks, some lessons are not appropriate; some lessons in the fifth grade are too deep, and some lessons in the sixth grade are shallower than those in the fifth grade. It is hoped that more articles that are in line with the actual lives of children, such as respecting teachers, elders, and loving labor, will be selected.
    Liu Jifang

Chinese teaching materials, like other subject teaching materials, should give children knowledge gradually, from shallow to deep, from easy to difficult, while at the same time carrying out ideological and political education. Some of the lessons in the fifth grade Chinese are a bit deep and would be more suitable to teach in the sixth grade, but in the sixth-grade teaching materials, some of the content or the number of new words that appear are shallower than those in the fifth-grade teaching materials. Secondly, the current Chinese teaching materials seem to neglect articles and application texts that guide children in writing, such as letters, diaries, invitations, reading notes, etc. In the future, when compiling teaching materials, we can appropriately select more articles that are short in length, clear in structure and paragraphs, and easy for children to imitate. As long as the content of such articles is good, ideological education can be carried out at the same time as guiding writing. Articles that are long in length can be attached to the back of the teaching materials as extracurricular reading guidance materials. In terms of the content of the articles, we hope to select some articles about children respecting teachers, elders, and loving labor, etc., that are in line with the actual lives of children, so as to facilitate ideological and moral education.

In the Chinese teaching materials for the lower grades, the line between which new characters and new words require four skills and which do not is not clear to the teachers, and it is difficult to grasp them appropriately. We hope that in the future when compiling teaching materials, it is best to attach a table at the back of the lessons to explain them, so that teachers can grasp them and carry out teaching. And we hope that in the Chinese teaching materials for grades three to six, the new characters and new words that appear in each lesson will be arranged in a unified manner, without being too much or too little, and a list of new characters and new words will be attached to the back of each textbook.

We feel that the grammar teaching materials are not systematically arranged, the content is too deep, and the terms are often changed, which brings certain difficulties to teaching. We hope that we can compile a systematic grammar teaching material that is related to the lessons.

I hope that the comrades who compile the teaching materials will go deep into life
    Li Yun

The fourth-grade Chinese teaching materials are too deep and not suitable for students to learn. Such as "Cheering for the Birth of the Constitution," "The Little Musician Yang Ke," and "China's Most Beautiful Big Park," etc. The lesson "The Little Musician Yang Ke" requires understanding and using 50 vocabularies. It was stipulated that it should be taught in six class periods, but it took seven class periods to complete. Because it is too literary and there are many difficult vocabularies to understand, it is difficult for students who have just been promoted from the third grade to the fourth grade to master.

The two lessons "Spring Girl" and "Young Farmers and Cuckoos" in the second volume of the fifth grade are best arranged in the third unit to teach, because you can't see the scenery of spring in the first or two weeks of school. There are fewer teaching days in the first semester, so it is best to delete the first and second lessons of the first volume of the fifth grade Chinese.

Grammar teaching materials and Chinese teaching materials are not connected, and the knowledge learned by students is not easy to consolidate, and there are relatively few practice materials.

According to the feedback from teachers and parents of students in grades one to six, the lessons in the Chinese teaching materials are too long and there are too many vocabularies, which makes it very difficult for children to learn. It is hoped that the comrades who compile the teaching materials will often go deep into elementary schools, experience the lives of elementary school students, understand their needs, and compile teaching materials that children like.

Phonetic alphabet textbooks make children feel very embarrassed. We can consider letting children learn some familiar vocabularies first, and then gradually teach them phonetic symbols using appropriate methods.
    Du Yifang

What I want to say is the problem of the phonetic alphabet teaching materials for the first grade of elementary school. Starting in 1956, the teaching of phonetic alphabet was changed to the "analysis and synthesis" teaching method, saying that this method is "scientific," but students are troubled, teachers are troubled, and many parents also feel confused. For example, to teach the two sounds "?" and "幺", you must first analyze a sentence from a picture of a child looking in the mirror and wearing a hat, analyze several words from a sentence, then analyze the syllable from a word with a new sound, and finally analyze the phonemes "?" and "?" from the syllable "戴", and finally find the sound of "?" from "?". The children learn the pronunciation of "?" in class. If they forget it, they have to go back step by step to remember this sound. Teachers feel sad while teaching. How can seven-year-old children who have just come from kindergarten be asked to accept such complex "phonetic training"! What is even more incomprehensible is why not choose the first tone characters first, but choose the fourth tone characters first? This kind of "scientific" method is naturally "steamed and sold hot" by teachers, regardless of whether students can accept it or not. Anyway, they have to take the teaching materials and ponder over them like guessing riddles. What is the effect? When checking in class, some students don't know what is going on, and all you can see on their little faces is an embarrassed expression. When children review at home, parents find it strange. How come the older sister learned it so well (what she learned in the past), but now the younger brother is not learning it well? The younger brother is not "stupid" than the older sister! In a hurry, some teachers secretly use the old method - using simple pictures representing a word to analyze the sound to teach students pronunciation and spelling. It is easy to teach and the learning effect is good. This is worth studying. Our requirement is to learn the phonetic alphabet on the basis of understanding. Can't we do it without making so many turns? I also think that for children who have just come from kindergarten, we can consider letting them learn some vocabularies that they are familiar with first, and then gradually teach them phonetic symbols using appropriate methods.

There are too few application texts. Some lessons have content that is mutually repetitive. Some lessons even teachers do not understand.
    Tong Baolu

The articles selected in the Chinese textbooks should be model essays, but because the lessons are long, students cannot understand and master them well, and cannot use them. There are also too few application texts in the Chinese textbooks. There are three lessons on letters in the third grade, and only one lesson in the sixth grade. In the past, there were lessons such as "Reading Club Invitation," "Reading Club Records," and "Reclamation Diary" in the textbooks, but the current textbooks do not have them. This is not good. Because some high school graduates cannot get into school and have to participate in productive labor, learning more application texts can be used in production and daily life.

There is too much general knowledge in the fourth-grade Chinese textbooks, and it is mostly focused on natural science. In comparison, there is too little common knowledge in history and geography. Some of the content of the common knowledge is repetitive, such as the content of the lessons "Why Pine Trees Do Not Grow" and "The Growth of Plants" and "How Plants Absorb Nutrients" are mutually repetitive.

Some of the materials selected for the lessons are not even understood by the teachers, making it difficult to teach. For example, in the lesson "Almighty Scaffolders," the teachers have never seen what it looks like, and the illustrations do not explain it, so how can we explain it clearly to the students?

The Chinese textbooks are very literary, with a lot of "literary language" and very little language that children are familiar with and often use. Suggestions: Publish unified reference materials; add sequential numbers to each lesson in the fifth and sixth-grade textbooks; grammar and language should be taught together, and the compilation of teaching materials should consider the systematic nature of the entire set of textbook lessons.
    Wang Baolu

The large number of long lessons in elementary school Chinese textbooks is a problem. Take the first volume used in the fifth grade, for example, there are a total of twenty-one lessons, 76 pages. For example, the lesson "The First Tempering" has as many as eight pages, and there are many others with six or seven pages. The Chinese textbooks used in the first semester of the sixth grade have a total of nineteen lessons and 139 pages. Among them, the third lesson, "Party Membership Dues," has more than fourteen pages. The characteristic of these lessons is that they are "literary" and can be said to be "very literary." However, the editors of these lessons only consider the "literary" aspect and do not consider that the students learning these lessons are children. Those long lessons, let alone not being able to be read by the children in the prescribed time, even some teachers cannot finish reading them.

There are also the problems of many new words and many "literary language." Some lessons have forty or fifty new words. The children cannot digest them, so how can we hope for good teaching results? In the Chinese textbooks, there is little language that children are familiar with and need daily, so they have to learn "literary language." The result is that they learn to use half sentences of "literary language," which makes teachers laugh and cry. When the children go home and talk about it, the parents also laugh and cry. In these "very literary" lessons, there are also many foreign stories, as well as many translated languages. Students can't even pronounce those long strings of foreign children's names clearly, so how can we talk about understanding the characters' personalities in the lessons and understanding the central ideas of the lessons? There are many stories of good children in China, why can't we choose a little more? Also, these long lessons are also selected very incompletely, and there are very few application texts.

I suggest: First, publish unified reference materials. Teachers must master the meaning of the lessons in order to teach students. Sometimes, in order to find out the meaning of the lessons, teachers have to spend a lot of time looking for reference materials everywhere. Sometimes it is difficult to find them, and even if they are found, they may not be suitable. For example, in the fifth-grade lesson "Two Red Flags," it is not clear whether it is saying "production is important" or "red flags are important," and it is not known what its basic idea should be. This requires a unified reference material to give an affirmative analysis. Second, the fifth and sixth-grade textbooks do not have sequential numbers one, two, three... for each lesson, which is very inconvenient for teaching. I can't think of any harm in adding sequential numbers. Why must they be removed? It is also very inconvenient to put the table of contents at the end of all the lessons. Third, grammar and language should be integrated together. You can teach the relevant grammar after finishing a unit, so that students can learn grammar and review the lessons at the same time. The grammar exercises can also use the content of the same unit. Grammar is intended to enable students to master language, and it is proven by facts that it is not very beneficial to students to separate them into two different things, but only makes students feel that both are very mysterious. Fourth, the systematic nature of the entire set of textbook lessons should be considered. It should be considered what aspects of knowledge students should master, how many characters and words in total, how to arrange them step by step, and how to connect the shallow with the deep. There are also problems with variant characters. Some are written this way in one lesson, but they are written that way in another lesson. Students want to ask, and teachers cannot answer. It is hoped that they will be unified. Fifth, the lessons should be adapted to the age and other characteristics of the students. For example, whether it is appropriate to have sentences such as "This is my wife," "Marry me," etc., especially some things about adult men and women, for children under the age of twelve or thirteen to learn, is very worthy of consideration. The fairy tales selected in the textbooks should also be serious, otherwise, they will have a bad effect.

The textbook is too heavy, the regulations are too rigid, and teachers do not have time to pay attention to the explanation of homophones and heterographs. The printing font of the textbook should be uniformly used in regular script.
    Zheng Guanghui

My feeling is that in the past, when teaching language, I had the time to pay attention to the explanation of homophones and heterographs, but now I can't pay attention to it. The reason is that the current textbook is too heavy and the regulations are too rigid, so I can only rush to teach. Teachers feel tight, and students also feel tight. It is really sad to see the poor appearance of the children. Especially in the afternoon class of the two-part system, the hotter the weather, the tighter it becomes, making it unbearable for the children. When children are tight, they can't rest well, and when they can't rest well, they become even tighter, and the learning effect is even worse.

For such "literary" lessons as the current ones, what should be reviewed in each unit should be listed in the textbook so that teachers can grasp it. For example, what is the lesson "Three Bears" in the second grade teaching students? This story is also told in kindergarten, supposedly to educate children on the concept of "big, medium, and small." Then what is it for students in the second grade of elementary school? I feel that it is not easy to grasp. Another example is the description of "the turtledove accompanying the singing oriole," what is it telling the children? The children are not familiar with the appearance and living habits of turtledoves, and how can we teach the children to understand "accompaniment"? I am afraid that many teachers cannot explain it clearly. In the same textbook, the "oriole" mentioned in the previous lesson, in the lesson "Oriole and Titmouse," says that "oriole" is actually "oriole." Is this to enrich the students' vocabulary? Or for what?

There is also too much common sense content in the Chinese textbooks. Especially in the third and fourth grades. There is a lot of common sense that is local, and some things in the south are difficult for northerners to understand because they have never seen them. For example, in the fourth-grade lesson "The Struggle Between Man and Water," there is the word "water mortar," which we cannot understand. Although we found reference books and drew pictures for the students when we lectured, the students still did not understand.

The printing font of the textbook should be uniformly used in regular script. Now some use Song imitation font, and some use other non-regular script fonts, which makes it feel very complicated for children to learn. Why does the same word have an extra dot sometimes and a missing stroke sometimes? When asked by teachers, the teachers cannot answer.

There are too few model essays in the teaching materials for students to refer to when practicing writing. The current teaching materials seem to be to cultivate children to become "small dogmatists," and the actual effect is exactly like this. It can be seen that whether it is "oral narration" or "written narration," the vocabulary and life that students practice writing are not what they are familiar with, but the vocabulary of dogmatism and the lives of adults learned from the textbooks.

Children have read many "literary" lessons, but there are too few places where children can be educated in moral character. In fact, children's moral education is very worthy of attention now.

What is the reason why children's writing is not good? It is mainly because the Chinese teaching materials focus on literature and neglect basic knowledge education.
    Wu Zhirui

The education department's requirements for teachers are too high. Many teaching materials are divorced from the children's real lives. For example, the lesson "Two Red Flags" describes a story that happened in a factory. Not only do the children not have factory production knowledge, but even the teachers do not have factory production knowledge. In addition, the lesson is too deep and too long for the children to understand. However, at the evaluation meeting of public teaching in Dongdan District, the education department also required teachers to plant the seeds of Marxism-Leninism when teaching this lesson, which is difficult. There are no good methods in the reference materials, and teachers dare not talk nonsense, which is really more difficult than ascending to heaven.

Now, the children's reading is really good. But the children's writing is not good. The sentences are ungrammatical, and words and sentences that have no connection with each other are pieced together, and they cannot explain the problem. There are many typos, and the Dongdan District Education Administrative Department requires the children's writing to be more than 200 words per article. Why is this? It is mainly the result of the Chinese teaching materials focusing on literature and neglecting basic knowledge education. We do not object to giving children literary cultivation, but we cannot regard it as the center.

There are too many dialects and local languages, which causes many difficulties for teaching. It is hoped that in the future when compiling teaching materials, the dialects and local languages in the lessons will be replaced as much as possible with words and sentences that ordinary people can understand.

Classical literature in elementary school textbooks is too deep.
    Chen Tangdi

Classical literature in elementary school Chinese textbooks is too deep. There are three poems in the fourth volume of the higher elementary school Chinese textbook. One is "Night Thoughts," which says, "Before my bed, bright moonlight, I suspect it is frost on the ground. I lift my head to look at the bright moon, I lower my head and think of my hometown." Students can understand this poem. But "Before Leaving the Frontier" says, "When drawing a bow, draw a strong one, When using an arrow, use a long one. ...If we can control the invasion, Why kill and injure so much." It is difficult for students to understand.

Many vocabularies in Chinese textbooks are not commonly used vocabularies. Words like "suddenly" and "instantly" are not as good as using "suddenly" or "suddenly." In addition, it is difficult to understand the local language, and standard language should be used.

The grammar in the sixth grade is not systematic and cannot be connected. The grammar in the fourth grade is too deep and difficult to understand.
    Xiao Yuyun

The grammar in the sixth grade is not as systematic as in the previous two years and cannot be connected. In the past, there was only a subject and a predicate in grammar, and there were main and subordinate components in the subject and predicate. Now it has been changed to subject, subject component, predicate, predicate component, central word, and modifier. In fact, the content is the same as in the past, but because the terminology has changed, students find it inconsistent before and after learning it, and it is easy to get confused. In the past, when talking about joint structure sentences, it was analyzed from the relationship of the sentences, such as from the relationship of parallel, causal, hypothetical conditions, etc. It was easier for students to understand when it was explained that way. This year's materials are not as good as last year's.

The grammar in the fourth grade is relatively deep and difficult to understand. For example, it is difficult for students to accept words of direction, words of tendency, and prepositions. At the same time, the grammar content has very little connection with the content of the Chinese textbook. Taking punctuation marks as an example, only the last section of the grammar class in the fourth grade of two semesters talks about punctuation marks. The grammar knowledge learned by students cannot be consolidated due to the lack of frequent practice opportunities. In the eighth volume of the fourth grade textbook, the lesson "Cheering for the Birth of the Constitution" has long lessons and deep meanings, which are not easy for children around the age of ten to understand.

In the long lessons in the sixth volume of the third-grade textbook, there are too many new words with new characters, and it is difficult for children to consolidate what they have learned. For example, there are 24 new characters in the 18th lesson. There are exercises at the end of each unit in the first and second-grade textbooks, but there are none in the third grade. It is best to add them so that children have the opportunity to review the lessons they have learned. Also, grammar and lessons are taught together in the first and second grades, but they are taught separately in the third grade, which is more difficult for children to accept. It is best to combine them.

    语文课本课文长、生字多、内容深，练习时间少，学过不易巩固；学生学习负担过重。编教材的人应多接近实际、接近教师、接近儿童。
    郑芸
    小学语文课本的问题，总起来说是课文长，生字多，内容深。孩子学习负担过重，尤其是一、二年级的孩子，入学后，身体发育受到影响。
    过去小学两年教七百字，现在要教一千五百字。小学一年级第一学期，学生就得认二百七十九字，默二百一十一字；不要求默写的字以后也没有交代。第二学期学生要认三百七十二字，但是加上第一学期剩下的生字，以及复习课的新字，实际上已远远超过此数。学过的不再算作生字，有的字学生只见过一次面。因此，虽然要求学一千五百字，事实上不能巩固，只能识一千二百字左右。教育部要我们创造巩固知识的方法，但是练习时间很少，怎能巩固呢？
    语文课本的课文太长，一、二年级有长达几百字的课文。例如“小猫钓鱼”一课有三百字，“白胡子老头”一课有九百多字，“森林老人”一课有四百九十五字，其中生字十六个，生词五个；五、六年级的课文也太长，“黄泥冈”一课长达八千多字，短的也有四、五千字。因为课文长，课堂上教师念一遍需要花十几分钟，孩子念一遍要二十甚至三十分钟。一节课总共才四十五分钟，朗读占去这样多的时间，学生感到枯燥无味。有些特别长的课文，教师一次不能讲完，必须分作几个教时去讲。
    小学第一学期开始就要学习单词，如毛主席、工人、农民、米、面、稻子、麦子等等，一周内要学将近三十个单词。有些单词学过一次即不复现，积累词汇毫无意义，孩子最难接受。有些教师说：“欠孩子的这笔债什么时候才能还呢？”
    许多课文文艺性太强、太深，不适合孩子的年龄特征，很难接受。例如初级小学语文课本第二册“小宝宝要睡觉”一课，说“……风不吹，云不飘，蓝蓝的天空静悄悄，小宝宝啊好好睡一觉”。这里描写的很美，但是孩子很难体会这种自然景象。又如同书“收麦”一课，开头说，“一大片麦地，望不到头。黄的麦子，蓝的天，在很远的地方接起来。……”这里，教师费了很大的劲讲解，孩子仍然不能理解黄的麦子怎么能够和蓝的天接起来。教师们建议，高年级的长课文和文艺性比较强的而又适合儿童年龄特征和兴趣的材料，可以附印在课文后面，作为课外阅读材料。
    对于现用的小学语文课本不少人是有意见的，但是，过去大家不敢提。人民教育出版社爱听好的，不愿听反面的意见。听到不同的意见，他们就不愉快。
    编辑教材是一件大事，我希望教育部能发动大家参加这一工作。我国过去旧的教材、教学法也有不少好东西，过去也有些编教材很有经验的人，应当把其中好的东西提炼出来，听听各方面的意见。对于教学大纲，也可以征求大家的意见，不要怕别人提意见。编辑教材的人要多接近实际，多接近教师，多接近儿童，不要闭门造车。只有这样，才能克服脱离生活实际，脱离教师、学生的知识水平，克服教条主义。对教材提意见，是为了六千万儿童学得的知识能够巩固，而又不损害他们的健康。
    课文要多加插图。出版社要再版字典。语法和语文分开讲不好。
    吕璋
    一年级的课文太深、生字多，孩子学了不容易巩固。课文和练习所用的词、句有时不一致。例如课文中有一句“粉红色的花瓣”，而在练习中却写的是“开满了粉红色的花”。孩子们在课文中学到的是“花瓣”，而在练习中却用粉红的花，如果老师不加讲述，很容易使儿童念错。这样前边的新词刚巩固，后边接着又出现一个类似的新词，对小孩子来说是困难的。因为他们都是刚从幼儿园出来的七周岁的孩子，大一点的孩子知道得多了，当然就不成问题。因此建议一年级的课文和练习中所用的词、句应该一样。现在的小学课本前面都没有注上“第一课”、“第二课”等字样，孩子翻起来很费劲，要凭脑子记，建议加上。
    三年级的课文有些需要配合图表来讲解，但是有些图表到处买不到。建议出版社出版一些，或者在课本上印上插图。
    课文插图太少，而且有些插图画得不好。希望出版社根据课文的主题思想或最高潮配合插图。这样可以使学生通过直观了解课文主要内容。
    课文内容宽度还不够，教师进行课外指导比较困难。有些比较长的课文可以附在课本后面作为课外阅读材料，以便和初中一的课程衔接起来。
    教师应该教学生查字典，但现在买不到好字典，只有一本四角号码的也不太好。过去新华字典很好，建议出版社再版。
    目前有些简体字真不好办，给教师学生增加了负担。例如，“義”字的简写是“义”，按理蚂蟻的“蟻”字写成“蚁”是对的，但是简字表上没有就不敢让学生写。现在我们采取的办法是，书本上已有的简体字就让学生照着写，没有的就不让写。
    有些词类的讲解现在和过去不一样了。例如“慢慢地”这三个字过去一直讲解为副词，现在说应该讲解为形容词。又如“好人”中的“人”字，过去讲解为主要成分，现在则讲为中心词，也不一样，我觉得一般地讲还可以，但要掌握规律就太难。
    现在把语法和语文分开来讲不大好。有这样的说法：语法是科学，语文是文学。讲科学时不讲文学，讲文学时不讲科学。譬如“我又一次地紧紧地愉快地握了孩子的手”这样的句子，如果孩子难于理解，我们可以这样说：“我”是主语，“握手”是谓语。学生容易理解。如果讲语文课时不联系语法，学生就不易理解了。
    此外，学校要求学生笔直地坐着听课，我觉得不大好。孩子连着这样上几堂课太吃力，影响学习效果。我建议上课时在能集中精神听讲的要求下，孩子坐的姿势可以适当变换。
    学生学习识字应该由浅入深，逐渐增加。三、四年级常识课太多，童话、革命故事太少。
    陈云贵
    一、二年级学生要学习一千五百个生字比较困难。过去对小学一、二年级学生要求学会七百字，那时学生学了还比较巩固。现在一下要求学一千五百个，孩子吃不消，实际上这一千五百个字中学生只能学会一千三百字左右，加上一、二年级教师在教生字时没有衔接好，不少学过的字，到了三年级又成了生字。
    让孩子先学许多词组不太好，一来孩子小，记不了这么多；二来有许多词组在以后的课文中再也不见面，根本用不上。
    一年级前学期“大萝卜”一课太长，生字多。教师为了使孩子能巩固这些字，提心吊胆，费很大劲，想尽办法来帮助孩子巩固，不少孩子的家长也在家里帮助孩子温课，但是效果并不好，30％左右的学生不能巩固全部生字。我们认为，一年级孩子学习识字，应该由浅入深，逐渐增加。让这么小的孩子学这么多的字是不太合理的，事实上已经影响了孩子的身心健康。
    二年级课文中要求四会的字——会读、会写、会讲、会用——没有和一年级连贯起来，加上孩子们由一年级升到二年级时又带了许多没巩固的生字，因此到了二年级，生字就加多了。这样，一年年升上去，孩子的年级虽然升高了，但是基础没有打好，许多生字、词、句都没巩固好，到了高年级，教师还要花费一定的时间来给孩子们补课。不少五、六年级的教师埋怨低年级的教师没有给孩子打好基础，实际上，低年级的教师意见也很多，真是有苦说不出。
    三、四年级的常识课太多，童话、革命故事的体裁太少。五、六年级的课文太深，而生动丰富的辞汇却很少。如六年级的“党费”这课书意义较深，教十几岁的孩子不大合适，教材应结合儿童实际需要。
    有些课文在描写一个好孩子的事迹时，前后不大一致。如“米嘉的五分”一课，前面的课文叙述米嘉改正了错误，变为一个好孩子，可是在以后的课文中，又说米嘉有了不好的行为。我认为在课本中出现一个好孩子，应该从头到尾都突出地写出他的好事迹，以便在孩子们的头脑中树立一个典型，随时随地去模仿这些好孩子。如果几篇课文描写一个人物的行动不一致时，就容易使孩子们模糊，不知道怎么是好。
    五、六年级的语文教材，在深浅难易的编排上，有些课文不够恰当；五年级有些课文嫌深，六年级有些课文同五年级比又嫌浅。希望多选一些尊师、敬长和热爱劳动等切合儿童生活实际的文章。
    刘继芳
    语文教材和其他科目教材一样，应该是由浅入深，由易到难，逐步给予儿童知识，同时进行思想政治教育。五年级的语文，有些课文深了一些，拿到六年级去讲比较合适，但在六年级的教材里，有些课文的内容或出现的新词的数量，比五年级的教材又浅了些。其次，现用的语文教材似乎忽略了指导儿童写作的文章和应用文，如书信、日记、请帖、读书笔记等。今后编写教材时可以适当地多选一些篇幅简短，结构、段落清楚，便于儿童模仿的文章。这样的文章只要内容好，在进行指导写作的同时，一样可以进行思想教育。篇幅长的文章，可以附在教材的后面，作为课外阅读指导教材。在文章的内容方面，我们希望选一些关于孩子们尊师、敬长和热爱劳动等切合儿童生活实际的文章，便于进行思想品德教育。
    在低年级的语文教材里，哪些生字、新词要求四会，哪些不要求达到四会，这个界线教师们不明确，很难恰当地掌握。我们希望在今后编写教材时，最好能在课文的后面附表说明，以便教师掌握，进行教学。并希望在三至六年级的语文教材里，把每课出现的生字、新词作一统筹安排，不要忽多忽少，并且列一生字、新词表附在每册教材的后面。
    语法教材，我们觉得编排的不够系统，内容太深，术语又常改变，给教学带来了一定的困难。我们希望能够编写一本系统的与课文有联系的语法教材。
    希望编教材的同志深入生活
    李云
    四年级的语文教材太深，不适合学生学习。如“欢呼宪法的诞生”、“小音乐家杨科”和“中国最美丽的大公园”等。“小音乐家杨科”一课，需要理解和运用的词汇就有五十个。规定六节课教完，结果教了七节课，才算结束了。因为文艺性太强，难理解的词汇多，刚从三年级升到四年级的学生很难掌握。
    五年级第二册“春姑娘”、“青年农民和布谷鸟”两课，最好编排在第三单元来教才合适，因为在开学的一、二周还看不到春天的景色。上学期授课日数较少，五年级第一册语文，最好删去一、二课才合适。
    语法教材和语文教材联系不起来，学生学到的知识不容易巩固，练习的材料也比较少。
    据一至六年级教师和学生家长的反映，语文教材课文太长，词汇多，孩子们学习很吃力，希望编写教材的同志经常深入小学校，体验小学生的生活，了解他们的需要，编写孩子们喜欢的教材。
    注音字母课本使孩子们感到很为难，可以考虑先让孩子们学习一些熟悉的辞汇，逐渐再用合适的方法教他们注音。
    杜怡芳
    我要说的是小学一年级的注音字母教材问题。1956年起教学注音字母改为“分析综合”的教学方法，说这方法“科学”，可是学生伤脑筋，教师伤脑筋，许多家长也感到莫名其妙。如教“?”、“幺”两个音，必须先从一张小孩照镜子戴帽的图，分析出一句话，从一句话里分析出包括几个辞，又从带有新音的辞里分析出音节，再从音节“戴”里分析出音素“?”、“?”，最后才从“?”找出“?”的音。孩子们当堂学会“?”的发音，如果忘了，就要一步一步往前推，才能想起这个音来。教师们一面教一面感到难过，刚从幼儿园上来的七岁的孩子，要叫他们接受这样复杂的“拼音训练”，如何吃得消！更使人想不通的是，为什么不先选第一声的字，而要先选第四声的字？这样的“科学”方法，自然教师也是“现蒸热卖”的，也不管学生能不能接受，反正都得拿着教材像猜谜一样地琢磨着去教。效果如何呢？当堂检查，有些学生就不知道是怎么回事，只看一幅幅小脸上尽是为难的表情。孩子回到家里复习时，家长们觉得很奇怪，怎么姐姐学的挺好（过去学的），现在弟弟却学的不好，弟弟并不比姐姐“笨”啊！急得没办法，有的教师就偷偷地用旧法——用代表一个辞的简单图画分析出音来的办法教学生读音和拼音，教的容易，学的效果也好。这就值得研究了。我们的要求是在理解的基础上学会注音字母，不拐这样多的弯不是也可以吗？我还想，刚从幼儿园上来的孩子们，可以考虑先让他们学习一些他们所熟悉的辞汇，逐渐再用合适的方法教他们注音。
    应用文太少。有些课文内容互相重复。有的课文连教师也不懂。
    仝葆陆
    语文课本选的文章应当是范文，但是，由于课文长，学生不能很好地理解和掌握，不会运用。语文课本里的应用文也太少，书信三年级有三课，六年级只有一课。过去课本上有“读书会”的请帖、“读书会记录”、“开荒日记”等课文，现在的课本都没有了。这样做不好。因为有些高小毕业生考不取学校，是要参加生产劳动的，多学点应用文，在生产和日常生活中就能够运用。
    四年级的语文课本里一般常识太多，而且多偏重于自然常识，相比之下，历史、地理方面的常识就太少了。常识的内容有些重复，如“松树为什么不生长”和“植物的生长”、“植物怎样吸收养料”等课的内容就相互重复。
    有的课文选的材料连教师也不懂，教起来很困难，像“万能的架工们”一课，教师都没见过它是个什么样子，插图又没有说明，怎么能给学生讲清楚呢？
    语文课本文艺性很强，“文学语言”多，孩子们熟悉的、常用的语言少。建议：出版统一的参考教材；五、六年级的课本每课前要有顺序数；语法和语文融合在一起讲，编写教材要考虑整套课本课文的系统性。
    王葆鲁
    小学语文课本的长课文多是个问题。以五年级用的第一册来说，共二十一课，七十六页。如“千锤百炼的第一次”一课有八页之多，其他六页、七页的也不少。六年级第一学期用的语文课本共十九课，一百三十九页。其中第三课“党费”，有十四页多。这些课文的特点是“文艺性”强，而且可以说“文艺性很强”。可是这些课文的编者只考虑到“文艺性”，没有考虑到学这些课文的是孩子。那些长的课文，不要说在规定的时间里孩子念不完，就是教师有的也念不完。
    还有生词多、“文学语言”多的问题。有些课有四、五十个生词。孩子们消化不了，如何能希望有好的教学效果。在语文课本里，孩子们熟悉的、日常需用的语言少，只好去学“文学语言”。结果是，学会了搬用半句半句的“文学语言”，弄得教师啼笑皆非。孩子回到家里说起来，家长也啼笑皆非。在这些“文艺性很强”的课文中，还有不少外国的故事，同时也有不少翻译的语言。那些一长串的外国孩子的名字，学生念也念不清，还谈什么了解课文中人物的性格，了解课文的中心思想？中国有许多好孩子的故事，为什么不可以多选一点呢？还有，这些长课文也选的很不全面，应用文就很少。
    我建议：第一，出版统一的参考教材。教师要掌握课文的意义才能教学生。有时候，教师为了弄清课文的意义，要费许多时间东去找参考教材，西去找参考教材。有时还很难找到，即使找到了也不一定合适。如五年级的“两面红旗”这一课，究竟说的是“生产要紧”，还是“红旗要紧”，也不知道它的基本思想到底应该是什么。这就很需要有统一的参考教材加以肯定的分析。第二，五、六年级的课本每课没有顺序数一、二、三……，这对教学很不方便。我就想不出加上顺序数有什么坏处，为什么一定要把它去掉。把目录摆在全部课文的后面，对教学也很不方便。第三，语法和语文应该融合在一起，尽可以在一个单元教完以后接着讲有关的语法，这样可以既使学生学了语法，又同时复习了课文。语法的练习也可以用同一单元的内容。语法本是为了使学生掌握语文的，硬要把它们分成两回事，事实证明对学生好处不大，只是使学生感到两者都很神秘似的。第四，应该考虑整套课本课文的系统性。要让学生掌握那几方面的知识，共计多少字、词，如何循序渐进地安排，浅的如何同深的衔接等，都应该考虑到。异体字也有问题，有的在这一课这样写，在另一课却又那样写，学生要问，教师没法回答，希望统一起来。第五，课文应该适应学生的年龄等特点。如课本中“这是我的妻子”、“嫁给我吧”等等语句，特别是谈成年男女间的一些事情的，给十二、三岁以下的孩子们学习，是否合适，很值得考虑。课本中选用的童话，也应该严肃，不然会起坏作用。
    课本分量太重，规定太死，教师没有时间注意同音异义字辞的讲解。课本的印刷字体要统一用正楷。
    郑光蕙
    我的感觉是，以前教语文有工夫注意到同音异义字辞的讲解，现在注意不到了，原因是现在的课本分量太重，规定太死，所以只能赶着教。教师感到紧，学生也紧。孩子们紧得那可怜样，看了真叫人难过。尤其是二部制的下午班，天一热，更紧得使孩子们受不了。孩子们一紧就休息不好，休息不好就更容易紧，学习效果更不好。
    像现在这样“文艺性”很强的课文，每一单元该复习什么，课本里应该列个提要，以便教师掌握。如二年级的“三只熊”一课，不知教给学生的是什么？这个故事在幼儿园也讲的，据说是为了使孩子们受到“大、中、小”观念的教育。那么对小学二年级的学生是为了什么呢？我就感到不好掌握。再如“斑鸠给歌唱的黄莺伴奏”这样的描写，又是告诉孩子们什么呢？斑鸠的外形、生活习性等，孩子们并不熟悉，而且教孩子们如何理解“伴奏”呢？恐怕许多教师也讲不清楚。同一课本，前一课中说的“黄莺”，到了“黄鹂和山雀”一课，又说“黄鹂”其实就是“黄莺”。这是为了丰富学生的辞汇呢？还是为了什么？
    语文课本中常识性的内容也太多。特别是三、四年级的太多。有许多常识却又是地方性的，南方的一些东西，北方人没见过就很难懂得。如四年级“人和水的斗争”一课里，有“水碓”一辞，我们就没法理解，虽然找到了参考书，讲的时候给学生画了图，学生仍然不懂。
    课本的印刷字体应该统一用正楷。现在有的用仿宋体，有的用非楷体的其他写法，孩子们学习起来就感到很复杂，同一个字为什么一会要多一点，一会又少一笔，问教师，教师也回答不上来。
    教材中可以供给学生练习作文时参考的范文太少。现在教材似乎是为了培养孩子们成为“小教条”，实际的效果也正是这样。可以看到，不论“口述”、“笔述”，学生们练习写的都不是自己所熟悉的辞汇和生活，而是课本里学到的教条主义气味的辞汇和大人的生活。
    孩子们读了许多“文艺性”强的课文，可是能够使孩子们受到品德教育的地方实在太少。实际上，现在孩子们的品德教育是很值得注意的。
    孩子们作文不好的原因在哪里呢？主要是语文教材偏重于文学，忽略了基本知识教育。
    吴枝瑞
    教育部门对教师的要求过高。有不少教材脱离孩子们的现实生活。如“两面红旗”一课，它是描写在工厂里发生的故事。不仅孩子没有工厂的生产知识，而且连教师也是没有工厂生产知识的，再加课文太深太长，孩子们理解不了。但是教育部门在东单区公开教学的评议会上，又要求教师在讲授这一课时，要种上马克思列宁主义的种籽，这是有困难的。参考资料上也没有好办法，教师又不敢随便乱说，这真是难于上青天。
    现在，孩子们的朗读真好。可是孩子们的作文不好，句子不通，把前后毫无联系的辞句拼放在一起，也不能说明问题，错别字连篇，而东单区教育行政部门要求孩子们的作文每篇都得在二百字以上。为什么会这样呢？主要是语文教材偏重于文学，而忽略了基本知识教育的结果。我们不反对给孩子们以文学修养，但不能把它当作中心。
    方言土语太多，给教学造成不少困难。希望今后再编写教材时，把课文中的方言土语，尽可能地换成一般人都能懂得的辞句。
    小学课本中的古典文学太深了。
    陈棠棣
    小学语文课本中的古典文学太深了。高小语文课本第四册有三首诗。一首是“夜思”，说“床前明月光，疑是地上霜。举头望明月，低头思故乡。”这首诗学生还可以懂。而“前出塞”说的“挽弓当挽强，用箭当用长。……苟能制侵陵，岂在多杀伤。”学生就很难理解了。
    语文课本的许多语汇，都不是常用的语汇。像“蓦地”“霍地”等等这样的语汇，就不如用“突然”或“忽然”好。另外，土语不好懂，应用标准语。
    六年级的语法不够系统，衔接不起来。四年级的语法较深，不容易理解。
    萧毓云
    六年级的语法没有前两年系统，衔接不起来。过去语法中就是主语和谓语，主语和谓语里边都有主要成分和附加成分。现在则改成主语、主语成分、谓语、谓语成分、中心词和附加语，其实内容和过去一样，但由于术语改变了，学生学起来前后不一致，容易混乱。过去讲联合结构句子时，是从句子的关系上来分析的，如从并列的、因果、假设条件等等关系上去分析。那样讲，学生还容易理解。今年这部分材料就没有上年的好了。
    四年级的语法比较深，不容易体会。如：方位词、趋向词和介词等学生接受起来比较困难。同时，语法内容和语文课本的内容联系很少。拿标点符号来说，四年级两学期的语法课中只有最后一节谈标点符号，学生所学的语法知识因无经常的练习机会，得不到巩固。四年级课本第八册中“欢呼宪法的诞生”一课课文长、含义深，十岁左右的儿童不容易理解。
    三年级课本第六册长课文中带生字的新词太多，孩子学了不容易巩固。如第十八课的生字就有二十四个。一、二年级的课本每单元后边有练习，而三年级就没有了，最好还增加，使儿童对学过的课文有复习的机会。又，一、二年级的语法和课文是结合讲的，到三年级就分开讲了，儿童接受比较困难，最好还是结合起来讲。
