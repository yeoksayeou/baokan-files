Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, April 28th: Polish Premier Cyrankiewicz delivered a report to the plenary session of the Polish Parliament on the 27th regarding the Polish government delegation's visit to seven Asian nations.

Cyrankiewicz first discussed the significant meaning of this visit. The mutual visits between the Polish government delegation and the leaders of these nations, separated by thousands of kilometers, are a necessary result of the following fact: nations that have shed the shackles of colonial slavery and aspire to maintain and consolidate independence, together with nations building socialism, are linked by a common will to safeguard peace and strive for progress (albeit through different paths and steps).

Next, Cyrankiewicz analyzed in detail the circumstances and outcomes of the delegation's visits and talks in various countries. He pointed out that the talks and joint statement between the leaders of Poland and India once again emphasized the belief of both governments that it is necessary to implement a proactive policy of peaceful resolution of all international disputes.

Speaking of the visit to China, Cyrankiewicz said that during the delegation's time in China, they felt everywhere the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the creative application of Marxism-Leninism in specific circumstances. Comrade Mao Zedong, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, received the delegation and the delegation handed over Comrade Zawadzki's letter to Comrade Mao Zedong. Comrade Mao Zedong is very concerned about the unity of the great family of socialist countries. We are very pleased that we will be able to welcome Comrade Mao Zedong to Poland. This statement received warm applause from the entire audience.

Cyrankiewicz also mentioned that the talks held with Soviet leaders while the delegation was passing through Moscow helped to further strengthen the friendly relations between the two countries and the unity of socialist countries.

Finally, Cyrankiewicz summarized the important significance and gains of this visit. He pointed out that this visit has brought Poland closer to Asian countries. The visit supported the policy of peace and neutrality of Southeast Asian countries, strengthened the unity of socialist countries and the strength and prestige of the socialist camp, and helped to develop equal and mutually beneficial economic relations between Poland and Asian countries.

    向波议会报告访问亚洲七国收获
    西伦凯维兹说此行不虚
    据新华社华沙28日电　波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹在27日的波兰议会全体会议上作了关于波兰政府代表团访问亚洲七国的报告。
    西伦凯维兹首先谈到这次访问的重大意义。波兰政府代表团和这些远隔数千公里的国家的领导人的互相访问是下面这一事实的必然结果：摆脱了殖民奴役枷锁并且希望保持和巩固独立的国家同建设社会主义的国家，由于维护和平和争取进步（虽然是通过不同的途径和不同的步骤）的共同意志而联结起来。
    接着，西伦凯维兹详细地分析了代表团访问各国和进行会谈的情况和结果。他指出，波印两国领导人的会谈和联合声明再一次强调了两国政府认为必须执行和平解决一切国际争端的积极政策的信念。
    西伦凯维兹在谈到访问中国时说，代表团在中国时，到处感到中国共产党的英明领导和在具体情况下对马克思列宁主义的创造性的运用。中华人民共和国主席毛泽东同志曾经接见了代表团，代表团把萨瓦茨基同志的信交给了毛泽东同志。毛泽东同志十分关心社会主义国家大家庭的团结。我们非常高兴我们将能在波兰欢迎毛泽东同志。这句话获得全场热烈掌声。
    西伦凯维兹还谈到，代表团在路过莫斯科时同苏联领导人进行的会谈有助于进一步加强两国的友好关系和社会主义各国的团结。
    西伦凯维兹最后总结了这次访问的重要意义和收获。他指出，这次访问使波兰同亚洲国家的关系更加密切了。这次访问支持了东南亚国家的和平中立政策，加强了社会主义国家的团结以及社会主义阵营的力量和威信，有助于发展波兰同亚洲国家的平等互利的经济关系。
