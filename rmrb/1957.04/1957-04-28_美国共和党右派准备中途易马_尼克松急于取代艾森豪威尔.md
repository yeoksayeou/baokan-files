Xinhua News Agency, April 25th: Paris: The "International Forum" weekly published a Washington dispatch on April 12 stating that the Nixon faction within the "right wing" of the American Republican Party is currently preparing a long-term plan to exclude Eisenhower and put Nixon in power.

At a recent presidential press conference, the "right wing's" strategists, through a reporter, posed a most explosive question to Eisenhower:

"Do you really want to withdraw from the political stage and let Nixon take over the real power of the presidency?"

At the time, the President was extremely agitated in front of reporters from major newspapers. Pale and in great distress, he replied: "This is the most appalling nonsense I have heard since I was elected president!"

"International Forum" said that the Republican "right wing" is dissatisfied with Eisenhower's foreign policy, believing that this policy is "outdated." They advocate taking advantage of "the current unrepeatable opportunity" to launch a war. Domestically, the "right wing" is also dissatisfied with Eisenhower's so-called "blatantly Roosevelt-style" social policies, accusing this policy of being "too costly."

"International Forum" said that Nixon and Knowland are both representatives of the Republican right wing. However, the two differ in their approach to this issue. The "Nixon conspirators" want to replace Eisenhower as soon as possible. Under the pretext of "Eisenhower's precarious health," they are firmly demanding that Congress formulate conditions under which the president can be declared unfit to hold office. However, Knowland's faction advocates letting Eisenhower "survive" until the end of his term, because they want to accumulate strength during this period to defeat the Nixon faction, and then have Knowland succeed to the presidency.

    美国共和党右派准备中途易马
    尼克松急于取代艾森豪威尔
    据新华社25日讯　巴黎：“国际论坛”周刊4月12日刊载一篇华盛顿通讯报道，美国共和党的“右派”里的尼克松分子目前正在准备一个长远的计划，企图排斥艾森豪威尔，而使尼克松当权。
    在最近一次总统记者招待会上，“右派”的战略家们通过一个记者向艾森豪威尔提出了一个最具爆炸性的问题：
    “你当真想退出政治舞台，让尼克松去执掌总统实权吗？”
    当时，总统在各大报纸的记者们面前极为激动。他脸色苍白、十分痛苦地回答说：“这是大家把我选做总统以来我所听到的最骇人听闻的怪论！”
    “国际论坛”说，共和党“右翼”不满艾森豪威尔的外交政策，认为这个政策“已经过时”，他们主张利用“目前不可再得的机会”来发动战争。在对内方面，“右派”也不满艾森豪威尔的所谓“公然是罗斯福式的”社会政策，指责这个政策“代价太高”。
    “国际论坛”说，尼克松和诺兰都是共和党右派的代表人物。但是他们二人在这个问题上的做法却各有不同。“尼克松阴谋派”想尽速取艾森豪威尔而代之。他们借口“艾森豪威尔的健康情况可虞”，坚决要求国会制定总统可以被宣布为不宜执行职务的条件。但是诺兰这一派却主张让艾森豪威尔“生存下去”直到任期届满为止，因为他们要在这个期间积集力量来击败尼克松派，然后再由诺兰来继任总统。
