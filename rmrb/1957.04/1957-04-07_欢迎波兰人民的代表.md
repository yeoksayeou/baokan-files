    Welcoming the Representatives of the Polish People
    The government delegation of the People's Republic of Poland, headed by Polish Chairman of the Council of Ministers Józef Cyrankiewicz, has arrived in our country for a friendly visit after visiting Burma, Cambodia, India, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. We welcome our distinguished guests with joy and cordiality. This visit is a major event in Sino-Polish relations. It will further promote the friendship and cooperation between our two peoples and will help strengthen the unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union and the noble cause of world peace.
    There is a deep, fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Polish people. We have always been concerned about the progress of the Polish people on the road to building socialism. We are very pleased that the Polish people, under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party, have made great achievements after twelve years of socialist construction. The Polish people have healed the serious wounds of war with the world-renowned "Warsaw speed" and have transformed Poland from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial-agricultural country. Compared with the pre-war level, Poland's total industrial output in 1956 has increased more than four times. During the post-war period, the Polish people have established and developed many heavy industry sectors and have learned to manufacture automobiles, tractors, jet aircraft, and many modern machines and equipment. Although there have been some deviations and shortcomings in economic policy in the past, this cannot negate the great achievements made by the Polish working people under the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party over the past twelve years. The Polish and foreign enemies attempted to use some of Poland's past deviations and shortcomings to discredit the socialist system and undermine the prestige of the Polish United Workers' Party, but their conspiracy has failed shamefully. The results of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee held last October and the Polish parliamentary elections held this February irrefutably prove that the Polish people are firmly choosing the socialist road and that the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party is supported by the Polish people. The Polish United Workers' Party is strengthening the unity of the entire party and the country based on the principles of Leninism, and is committed to consolidating friendly cooperative relations with other socialist countries and overcoming some existing difficulties. These efforts have yielded results. We believe that Poland's socialist construction will continue to move forward.
    The Polish people are active fighters for peace. In the post-war period, the Polish people, together with the socialist countries and peace-loving people all over the world, have resolutely worked to ease international tensions and promote international cooperation. Poland actively advocates the establishment of a European collective security system and firmly opposes the revival of West German militarism. In the United Nations, all of Poland's activities are also aimed at upholding the principles of the UN Charter and safeguarding world peace. As a member of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea and the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Indochina, Poland has made important contributions to peace in Asia. The Polish people strive to support the anti-colonialist struggles of the people of Asia and Africa and continuously develop political, economic, and cultural relations with Asian and African countries. The recent visit of Polish Chairman of the Council of Ministers Józef Cyrankiewicz to Burma, Cambodia, India, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is proof of the increasingly close friendly relations between Poland and Asian countries.
    The fraternal friendly and cooperative relations between China and Poland have been continuously strengthened in recent years. Trade between our two countries is developing smoothly. In 1956, the trade volume between China and Poland increased by 46% compared with 1951, and the recently signed Sino-Polish trade and payment agreement stipulates that this year's trade volume will increase again compared with last year. Through this mutually beneficial trade, China has obtained steel, machine tools, transportation equipment, agricultural machinery, chemical raw materials, etc. needed for industrial and agricultural construction from Poland, while China also supplies Poland with various industrial raw materials, agricultural products, and food. In addition to supplying China with complete sets of equipment for two modern sugar factories, Poland is now designing an even larger sugar factory for China. Chinese workers and engineering technicians have also learned many advanced science and technologies from Polish experts. Poland has also given us great assistance in ocean shipping. The merchant fleets currently traveling between Chinese and Polish ports not only ensure the smooth implementation of trade agreements between the two countries and between China and other fraternal countries, but also help to shatter the imperialist "blockade" and "embargo" against our country. Poland has also given China active support in politics. Poland has consistently advocated the restoration of China's legitimate status in the United Nations and supports China's struggle to safeguard its territorial integrity and sovereignty. We express our heartfelt thanks for the multifaceted assistance Poland has given us. At the same time, our two countries' cultural cooperative relations are also developing smoothly. We have exchanged many cultural, artistic, scientific, educational, and sports delegations, and have held many exhibitions introducing each other. This kind of cultural exchange has increased the understanding between the Chinese and Polish people and brought us closer together in spirit.
    The exchange of visits between leaders of the two countries is of great significance for enhancing the friendship between the Chinese and Polish people. Chinese Vice Chairman Zhu De, Premier Zhou Enlai, and others have visited Poland. The late Polish Comrade Bolesław Bierut and other party and government leaders have also visited our country. The warm welcome Premier Zhou Enlai received during his visit to Poland in January this year was a vivid manifestation of Sino-Polish friendship. We believe that the visit to our country by the Polish government delegation headed by Polish Chairman of the Council of Ministers Józef Cyrankiewicz is of equally important significance for our two peoples.
    The Polish guests will stay in our country for several days. During these days, Polish Chairman of the Council of Ministers Józef Cyrankiewicz and other distinguished guests will hold talks with our national leaders, visit various places, and make contact with people from all walks of life. We believe that these activities will enhance the Polish people's understanding of China's socialist construction and national life and strengthen the friendly relations between China and Poland. Our two countries will be able to better work together to strengthen the unity of the socialist countries and safeguard world peace.

### 欢迎波兰人民的代表

    欢迎波兰人民的代表
    以波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹为首的波兰人民共和国政府代表团，在访问了缅甸、柬埔寨、印度和越南民主共和国以后，已来到我国进行友好访问。我们怀着愉快而亲切的心情来欢迎我们的贵宾。这次访问是中波关系中的一件大事。它将进一步促进我们两国人民之间的友谊和合作，并有助于加强以苏联为首的社会主义各国的团结和世界和平的崇高事业。
    中波两国人民之间有着深厚的、兄弟般的友谊。我们一向关切着波兰人民在建设社会主义道路上前进的步伐。使我们十分高兴的是：波兰人民在波兰统一工人党的领导下经过十二年的社会主义建设，已经取得了巨大的成就。波兰人民以举世闻名的“华沙速度”医治了战争的严重创伤，并且把波兰从一个落后的农业国改变为一个先进的工业—农业国。如果同战前水平相比较，波兰1956年的工业总产值已经增加了四倍以上。战后期间，波兰人民建立和发展了许多重工业部门，学会了制造汽车、拖拉机、喷气式飞机和许多现代化的机器设备。虽然过去在经济政策上曾经有过一些偏差和缺点，但是这绝不能否定十二年来波兰劳动人民在波兰统一工人党领导下所取得的巨大成绩。波兰国内外敌人企图利用波兰过去的一些偏差和缺点，来诋毁社会主义制度和破坏波兰统一工人党的威信，但是它们的这种阴谋已经可耻地失败了。去年10月召开的波兰统一工人党八中全会和今年2月举行的波兰议会选举的结果，都无可辩驳地证明：波兰人民是坚决地选择社会主义道路的，波兰统一工人党的领导是得到波兰人民的拥护的。波兰统一工人党根据列宁主义的原则加强全党和全国的团结，致力于巩固同其他社会主义国家的友好合作关系和克服存在着的一些困难。这些努力已经获得了成果。我们相信，波兰的社会主义建设事业将继续向前推进。
    波兰人民是争取和平的积极战士。在战后时期，波兰人民同社会主义各国和全世界爱好和平的人民一起，坚决地为缓和国际紧张局势和增进国际合作而努力。波兰积极主张建立欧洲集体安全体系，并坚决反对西德军国主义的复活。在联合国组织中，波兰的一切活动也是以维护联合国宪章的原则、保障世界和平为目的的。作为朝鲜中立国监察委员会和印度支那国际监督和监察委员会的成员，波兰对于亚洲的和平作出了重要的贡献。波兰人民竭力支持亚非各国人民的反殖民主义斗争，并不断地发展同亚非国家的政治、经济和文化关系。最近波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹访问缅甸、柬埔寨、印度和越南民主共和国之行，就是波兰同亚洲国家的友好关系日益密切的证明。
    中波两国兄弟般的友好合作关系，几年来已在不断加强。我们两国的贸易正在顺利发展。1956年我国和波兰的贸易额已经比1951年增加了46％，最近签订的中波贸易和支付协定规定今年的贸易额又比去年有所增长。经过这种互通有无的贸易，我国从波兰取得了工农业建设所需要的钢材、工作母机、运输设备、农业机器、化学原料等，同时我国也以各种工业原料、农产品和食品供应波兰。波兰除了已经供给我国两个现代化的制糖厂的全套设备外，现在又为我国设计一个规模更大的制糖厂。我国的工人和工程技术人员也从波兰专家那里学会了许多先进的科学技术。波兰在远洋航运方面也给我们很大的帮助。目前往来中波两国港口的商船队，不仅保证了两国之间以及我国同其他兄弟国家之间贸易协定的顺利执行，而且也有助于粉碎帝国主义对我国的“封锁”和“禁运”。波兰在政治上也给了中国以积极的支持。波兰一贯主张恢复中国在联合国组织内的合法地位，并支援我国为维护领土和主权完整而作的斗争。我们对于波兰给予的多方面援助表示衷心的感谢。同时，我们两国在文化方面的合作关系也在顺利地发展着。我们相互交换了许多文化、艺术、科学、教育和体育的代表团，相互举办过许多介绍对方的展览会。这种文化交流使中波两国人民增进了彼此之间的了解，使我们在精神上更加亲近了。
    两国国家领导人的往来，对于增进中波两国人民的友谊具有重大的意义。我国朱德副主席、周恩来总理等都曾访问过波兰。波兰已故的贝鲁特同志以及其他一些党政负责人也曾访问过我国。周恩来总理今年1月在波兰访问时受到的热烈欢迎，是中波友谊的生动表现。我们相信，以波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹为首的波兰政府代表团这次来访我国，对于我们两国人民也都有同样重要的意义。
    波兰贵宾们这次在我们国土上将作数日逗留。在这些日子里，波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹和其他贵宾们将要同我国国家领导人进行会谈，到各地参观访问并同各方面人士进行接触。我们相信，这些活动将会增进波兰人民对我国社会主义建设和国家生活的了解，加强中波两国的友好关系。我们两国将能更好地携手合作，为加强社会主义国家的团结和维护世界和平而共同努力。
