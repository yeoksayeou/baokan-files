New Plans for Plundering Middle Eastern Oil
Hong Maojin

The United States and other Western colonial powers are stepping up their plans to lay new pipelines in the Middle East to further plunder Middle Eastern oil and resist the national independence movements there. In this scheme, sharp competition is unfolding among the imperialist powers.

The Middle East is a region rich in oil. In 1955, oil production was 160 million tons, and in the first half of 1956, the annual rate of production reached 176 million tons, accounting for approximately one-quarter of the total oil production in the capitalist world. Most of the extracted oil is shipped to Western Europe. Before the invasion of Egypt, Western Europe relied on the Middle East for three-quarters of its oil consumption. Of the oil shipped to Western Europe, about three-fifths were directly transported by oil tankers,绕过 the Persian Gulf around the Arabian Peninsula, and through the Suez Canal; the remaining two-fifths were first transported via pipelines to ports on the eastern Mediterranean coast, and then loaded onto oil tankers.

The existing major pipelines in the Middle East belong to the Iraq Petroleum Company and the Arabian American Oil Company (ARAMCO). The former is jointly operated by the oil monopoly capital of British, American, French, and Dutch colonial powers, with British capital holding a controlling position; the latter is an affiliate of ARAMCO, which is exclusively owned by the United States.

The Iraq Petroleum Company's main pipelines include four, all running from the oil production center of Kirkuk to Mediterranean ports. Two parallel pipelines run from Kirkuk through Syria to Tripoli, Lebanon, each 531 miles long. One pipeline runs from Kirkuk through Jordan to Haifa, Israel, but this pipeline has long been out of use due to the conflict between Israel and Arab countries. There is also a larger pipeline from Kirkuk to Banias, Syria, 550 miles long, capable of transporting over 14 million tons of oil annually.

The Arabian American Oil Company's (ARAMCO) affiliate, the Arabian Pipeline Company, owns the largest pipeline, running from Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, through Jordan and Syria to Sidon, Lebanon, totaling 1,068.2 miles in length and capable of transporting 16 million tons of oil annually.

In addition, the Iraq Petroleum Company's Mosul Petroleum Company, Basrah Petroleum Company, and Qatar Petroleum Company have built several small-scale pipelines connecting to the Persian Gulf or major pipelines. ARAMCO and the Iranian Oil Company also have several small-scale pipelines from oil production areas to the Persian Gulf.

After the invasion of Egypt, the Suez Canal was blocked, and the three pipelines of the Iraq Petroleum Company passing through Syria were cut off by the Syrian people who supported Egypt. As a result, oil transportation was interrupted, and oil panics were widespread in Western European countries.

Now the canal has been opened, and the damaged pipelines are being repaired. However, the imperialists' conspiracy to force Egypt to give up its sovereignty over the canal has repeatedly failed, and Syria's support for Egypt is unwavering. Under these circumstances, it is not foolproof for the colonial powers, led by the United States, to transport the oil they plunder in the Middle East. To improve their disadvantageous position in oil transportation and resist the Suez Canal, they have recently been actively planning a series of plans for laying new pipelines. The common feature of these plans is the intention to bypass the canal and countries such as Syria that insist on independence and freedom, and to lay new pipelines in the territories of the Baghdad Pact countries and Israel.

Recently, managers of the Western eight major oil companies (Standard Oil of New Jersey, Socony Mobil Oil, Standard Oil of California, Gulf Oil, Texaco, Compagnie Française des Pétroles, Royal Dutch Shell, and British Petroleum), which monopolize Middle Eastern oil, discussed the issue of laying a large pipeline from Iraq to Turkey in London. According to the Paris "International Forum," the international cartel plans to build a pipeline from the Mosul oil field in Iraq to Mersin or Alexandretta (Iskenderun) in Turkey, and another double-line will connect Basra and Alexandretta. The international cartel also considered the construction of two other pipelines: one from southern Iraq through Kuwait to the Persian Gulf, and another from the Israeli port of Eilat on the Gulf of Aqaba to Haifa on the eastern Mediterranean coast.

The pipeline from southern Iraq through Kuwait to the Persian Gulf has been agreed upon by the Iraq Petroleum Company and the Iraqi government. The outlet of this pipeline will be at the port of Ahmadi in Kuwait. In this way, large oil tankers can come to this port to load oil, whereas currently large oil tankers cannot reach the pipeline terminals on Iraqi territory.

The issue of laying new pipelines in Israeli territory is currently the most contentious issue among Western countries. There is currently an 8-inch diameter pipeline approximately 200 miles long between Eilat and Beersheba, with an annual oil transportation capacity of only a few hundred thousand tons. This summer, the pipeline will be widened by a factor of two, and extended from Beersheba to Ashdod Yam on the Mediterranean. The proposed new pipeline would extend along this route directly to Haifa. Compared with other major pipelines, this new pipeline is shorter, the terrain is flat, and construction is easier. It is estimated that after the pipeline is completed, transportation costs will be about 15% lower than through the canal. French oil capital, which has a smaller share in the international cartel, is striving to improve its position and is most active in building this pipeline. Agence France-Presse reported on April 5 that France has agreed to provide Israel with a $30 million loan to build the pipeline. France and Israel have also established two government committees in Paris and Jerusalem to plan the construction of this pipeline. The British-controlled Iraq Petroleum Company, which owns a refinery in Haifa, is also very concerned about this. David Ormsby-Gore, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs under the British government, said in the House of Commons on the 8th that there is a commercial basis for negotiating with Israel on the issue of laying oil pipelines, and the negotiations should be conducted by oil companies. The US government, which safeguards the interests of American oil bosses, is even more ambitious and has taken the lead. It is clamoring that the Gulf of Aqaba is an "international waterway" and openly violating the territorial waters of Egypt and Saudi Arabia, sending the first oil tanker through the Gulf of Aqaba. Its purpose is to attempt to control this waterway and thereby use it to connect the future pipeline passing through Israel directly to the Mediterranean Sea, in order to strengthen the US monopoly and political control over Middle Eastern oil.

Italian, West German, and Japanese oil capital, which are excluded from the international cartel, have also been actively operating in the Middle East recently. According to reports, they have reached an agreement with the Iranian government to build a pipeline from Iran's newly discovered Qom oil field, through northwestern Iran and southeastern Turkey, to Alexandretta.

From the imperialists' plans to build new pipelines in the Middle East, people can more clearly see their fierce faces of hostility towards the national independence movements of Arab countries and their attempts to further plunder Middle Eastern oil. (Image attached)

    掠夺中东石油的新策划
    洪茂金
    美国和其他西方殖民主义国家正在加紧策划在中东铺设新的油管，以便进一步掠夺中东石油，对抗中东民族独立运动。在这个策划中，帝国主义之间展开了尖锐的争夺战。
    中东是盛产石油的地区。1955年石油产量为一亿六千万吨，1956年上半年产量年率达到一亿七千六百万吨，约占资本主义世界石油总产量的四分之一。大部分开采出来的石油都运往西欧。侵埃战争前，西欧用油量的四分之三仰给于中东。在运往西欧的石油中，约五分之三直接用油船运输，从波斯湾绕过阿拉伯半岛，穿过苏伊士运河；其余约五分之二则先经油管输送到地中海东岸港口，然后再装上油船。
    中东现有的几条主要油管是属于伊拉克石油公司和阿拉伯油管公司的。前者是英美法荷殖民主义国家的石油垄断资本合组经营的，英国资本占控制地位；后者是美国独占的阿美石油公司的附属机构。
    伊拉克石油公司的主要油管有四条，都是从产油中心基尔库克通向地中海港口。从基尔库克经叙利亚到黎巴嫩的黎波里港有两条平行油管，各长五百三十一英里。从基尔库克经过约旦到以色列海法港有一条油管，由于以色列和阿拉伯国家之间的冲突，这条油管早已不用了。还有一条规模较大的油管，从基尔库克通到叙利亚巴尼亚斯港，长五百五十英里，每年可输油一千四百万吨以上。
    阿美石油公司附属的阿拉伯油管公司拥有一条最大的油管，从沙特阿拉伯的达兰经约旦、叙利亚到黎巴嫩西顿港（赛义达），全长一千○六十八点二英里，每年可输油一千六百万吨。
    此外，伊拉克石油公司所属的摩苏尔石油公司、巴士拉石油公司和卡塔尔石油公司，修建了若干小规模的油管，通向波斯湾或主要油管。阿美石油公司和伊朗石油公司也有几条小规模的油管从石油产地通向波斯湾。
    侵埃战争发生后，苏伊士运河遭到堵塞，伊拉克石油公司通过叙利亚的三条油管又被支持埃及的叙利亚人民所切断。结果石油运输中断，西欧各国普遍发生石油恐慌。
    现在运河已经通航，破坏了的油管也在修复。但是，帝国主义者迫使埃及放弃对运河的主权的阴谋一再遭到失败，叙利亚对埃及的支持又坚定不移。在这种情况下，以美国为首的殖民主义国家要把在中东掠夺的石油运出来还不是万无一失的。为了改善它们在石油运输上的不利地位，并抵制苏伊士运河，它们最近积极进行铺设新油管的一系列计划的策划。这些计划的共同点是打算绕过运河和叙利亚等坚持独立自由的国家，在巴格达条约国家和以色列领土上铺设新油管。
    最近，垄断中东石油的西方八大石油公司（新泽西美孚油公司、纽约美孚油公司、加利福尼亚美孚油公司、海湾石油公司、德士古石油公司、法兰西石油公司、荷兰皇家石油公司和英国石油公司）的经理们在伦敦就讨论了从伊拉克到土耳其铺设大油管这个问题。据巴黎“国际论坛”报道，国际卡特尔计划从伊拉克的摩苏尔油田到土耳其的梅尔辛或亚历山大勒达（伊斯肯德伦）修建一条油管，还有一条双管线路将把巴士拉和亚历山大勒达联系起来。国际卡特尔还考虑了另外两条油管的修建问题：一条从伊拉克南部经过科威特到波斯湾，另一条从亚喀巴湾的以色列港口埃拉特到地中海东岸的海法。
    从伊拉克南部经科威特到波斯湾的油管已由伊拉克石油公司同伊拉克政府议妥修筑。这条油管的出口将在科威特的艾哈迈迪港。这样，大型油船就可以来到这个港口装运石油，而目前大型油船是不能驶达伊拉克领土上的油管终点的。
    在以色列领土上铺设新油管的问题，是目前西方国家纷争最大的问题。在埃拉特到比尔希巴之间现有一条口径八吋，长二百英里左右的油管，每年输油量不过几十万吨，今年夏天将把这条油管加宽一倍，并从比尔希巴延长到地中海的阿希达德雅姆去。拟议中的新油管则沿此线路伸延，直达海法。这条新油管与其他主要油管比较，线路短，地势平坦，施工容易。据估计，油管修成后，运油费用将比通过运河节省15％左右。在国际卡特尔中所占份额较小的法国石油资本，力求改善自己的地位，对修建这条油管最为积极。法新社4月5日消息说，法国已同意给以色列三千万美元的贷款以修建油管。法国和以色列还在巴黎和耶路撒冷成立了两个政府委员会，筹划修建这条油管。英国控制的伊拉克石油公司在海法拥有一座炼油厂，对此也极为关心。英国协办外交事务国务大臣欧姆斯比一戈尔8日在下院说，同以色列商谈铺设石油管问题有一个商业基础，谈判要由石油公司进行。维护美国石油老板利益的美国政府更是野心勃勃，先声夺人。它正在叫嚷亚喀巴湾是一条“国际水道”，并公然侵犯埃及和沙特阿拉伯的领水，派遣第一条油船通过亚喀巴湾。其目的是企图控制这条水道并从而把这条水道用来接通将来经过以色列直通地中海的油管，以加强美国对中东的石油垄断和政治控制。
    被排斥在国际卡特尔之外的意大利、西德和日本的石油资本，近来也在中东地区积极活动。据报道，它们已同伊朗政府取得协议，将修建一条油管，从伊朗新发现的库姆油田，经伊朗西北部和土耳其的东南部，通到亚历山大勒达。
    从帝国主义在中东建筑新油管的计划中，人们更清楚地看出了它们敌视阿拉伯国家民族独立运动和企图进一步掠夺中东石油的凶恶面目。（附图片）
