State Council Directive on Developing Small Coal Mines

In recent years, China's coal industry has greatly developed. In 1956, the national output of state-owned and locally state-owned coal mines reached over 105 million tons, an increase of 65% compared to 1952. In addition, the output of individual handicraft coal mining reached over 4.6 million tons, an increase of about threefold compared to 1952. However, with the rapid development of the national economy, the demand for coal from industrial and mining enterprises, transportation, and cities is constantly increasing. After agricultural cooperativization, due to the development of farmland water conservancy, the expansion of the planting area of cash crops and high-yield crops, and the implementation of mountain closure for afforestation and soil and water conservation, the sources of firewood, which originally served as the main fuel for the masses, have relatively decreased, and the demand for coal in the vast rural areas has also greatly increased. Therefore, although coal production has greatly increased in recent years, it still cannot keep up with the demand for coal from the entire national economic development and people's lives.

In order to systematically meet the growing demand for coal for production and civilian use, on the one hand, it is necessary to vigorously promote coal conservation and pay attention to the arrangement of rural fuel in agricultural production. On the other hand, existing state-owned and locally state-owned coal mines should continue to tap their potential and actively increase production, and construction projects approved by the state should accelerate the construction speed and strive to put them into production ahead of schedule. However, it must also be recognized that due to China's vast territory and large population, and inconvenient transportation in some areas, state-owned and locally state-owned coal mines can only supply the coal needs of industry, transportation, urban residents, and some rural areas for a certain period. They are far from being able to meet the needs of the vast rural areas. Therefore, in areas with coal resources, it is very necessary to restore and open some small coal mines in a guided and active manner, according to the needs, in order to solve the supply of civilian fuel locally. Past inappropriate measures that restricted local and mass coal mining should be abolished.

China is rich in coal resources and widely distributed, and the masses have a long history of using indigenous methods for coal mining. In the early days of the national liberation, indigenous coal mines were extremely common. However, due to the lack of planning and management, some small mines were mined and excavated indiscriminately, which damaged the larger coal resources in some mining areas. At the same time, production was very unsafe. In addition, compared with the demand at that time, there was still a surplus in coal production. Therefore, the former Ministry of Fuel Industry, with the approval of the former Financial and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council in 1950, promulgated three documents: "Provisional Management Measures for Public and Private Coal Mines," "Provisional Handling Measures for Indigenous Coal Mines," and "Key Points for Safety Production Management of Public and Private Coal Mines," and various localities rectified and handled small coal mines. These measures and regulations played a role in protecting national resources and improving the working conditions of local coal mines, and it was also necessary to take these measures as temporary measures under the specific circumstances at that time. However, even at that time, due to insufficient estimation of the role of small coal mines in meeting the needs of civilian fuel, some regulations were too restrictive and the requirements were too high, resulting in the closure of too many mines, which adversely affected the development of small coal mines. This was also inappropriate.

In order to restore and open small coal mines and expand coal resources to meet the needs of coal for urban and rural areas, especially the vast rural areas, the following provisions are now made:

    1.  The "Provisional Management Measures for Public and Private Coal Mines," "Provisional Handling Measures for Indigenous Coal Mines," and "Key Points for Safety Production Management of Public and Private Coal Mines" promulgated by the former Ministry of Fuel Industry in 1950 should be temporarily suspended, and the Ministry of Coal Industry should be instructed to re-study and revise them. Provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government should formulate management measures for developing small coal mines based on the specific conditions of their regions.
    2.  In accordance with the principle of overall planning and appropriate arrangements, areas where coal supply is insufficient but have coal resources should, in accordance with the principle of self-production and self-sale, have county (city) people's committees, agricultural cooperatives, or handicraft cooperatives locally mine small coal mines to solve the local coal needs for civilian and industrial use. However, when building small coal mines in mining areas with abundant coal resources and development prospects, the people's committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government must work with the regional administration bureaus under the Ministry of Coal Industry to make plans and make proper arrangements so as to combine with long-term development.
    3.  Existing small coal mines in production in state-owned and locally state-owned mining areas should also be planned, demarcated, and mined. If they do have a significant impact on the development of state-owned or locally state-owned coal mines, the people's committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government should study and resolve the matter with the regional administration bureaus of the Ministry of Coal Industry and adopt limited mining, and should not easily close them.
    4.  In order to fully utilize coal resources and avoid causing spontaneous combustion disasters, various regions should strengthen guidance to small coal mines, try their best to increase the recovery rate, pay attention to preventing the abandonment of pulverized coal and crushed coal underground, and only mining thick coal without mining thin coal.
    5.  Pay attention to the organization and management of small coal mine mining. The people's committees of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government should properly arrange the relationship between townships and townships, and cooperatives and cooperatives within the mining area.
    6.  Sufficient attention must be paid to the safety production of small coal mines. Each small coal mine must have two exits. In the production process, necessary safety measures should be taken as much as possible, and safety education for workers should be strengthened. For small coal mines with seasonal production, the wellheads should be sealed when production is stopped, and measures to prevent suffocation accidents should be taken when production is restored.

In order to achieve the goal of safe production, industrial departments at all levels should strengthen guidance to small coal mines, regularly check the safety conditions of small coal mines, and provide specific assistance.

### 国务院关于发展小煤窑的指示

    国务院关于发展小煤窑的指示
    几年来，我国煤炭工业已经有了很大的发展。1956年全国国营、地方国营煤矿产量已达一亿零五百余万吨，比1952年增长了65％；此外，个体手工业采煤产量达四百六十余万吨，比1952年增长了三倍左右。但是，随着国民经济的迅速发展，工矿企业、交通运输业和城市需煤量不断增加；农业合作化以后，由于农田水利的发展，经济作物和高产作物种植面积的扩大，以及封山育林、水土保持工作的开展，原来供做群众主要燃料的柴草的来源相对减少，广大农村对煤炭的需要也大为增加。因而，煤炭产量几年来虽有很大的提高，但仍然赶不上整个国民经济发展和人民生活对煤炭的需求。
    为了有步骤地满足生产和民用煤炭日益增长的要求，一方面必须大力提倡节约用煤，并在农业生产中注意农村燃料的安排；另一方面现有国营和地方国营煤矿应当继续发掘潜力、积极提高产量，已经国家批准的建设项目要求加快建设速度，争取提前投入生产。但还必须看到，由于我国地广人多，某些地区交通不便，在一定的时期内，国营和地方国营的煤矿还只能供应工业、交通运输业、城市居民和部分农村对煤炭的需要，对于广大农村，还远远地不能满足他们的需要。因此，在有煤炭资源的地区，根据需要情况，有领导地、积极地恢复和开办一些小煤窑，以就地解决民用燃料的供应，是很必要的；过去某些不适当的限制地方和群众采煤的办法，则应取消。
    我国煤炭资源丰富、分布很广，群众对土法采煤有着悠久的历史。全国解放初期，土采煤窑极为普遍，但因缺乏规划和管理，若干小窑乱采乱掘，使某些矿区较大的煤炭资源受到破坏，同时，生产很不安全，加以当时煤炭产量和需要相较，还有富裕，故前燃料工业部于1950年经前政务院财政经济委员会批准，颁布了“公私营煤矿暂行管理办法”“土采煤窑暂行处理办法”“公私营煤矿安全生产管理要点”等三个文件，由各地对小煤窑进行了整顿和处理。这些办法和规定对于保护国家资源和改善地方煤矿劳动条件上是起了一些作用，在当时的具体情况下，把这些措施作为一种临时措施也是必要的。但即使在当时，由于对小煤窑在满足民用燃料方面的作用估计不足，若干规定限制过严、要求过高，以致封闭过多，使小煤窑的发展受到了不利影响，也是不妥当的。
    为了恢复和开办小煤窑，扩大煤炭资源满足城乡用煤，特别是广大农村用煤的需要，现在做如下规定：
    1、1950年前燃料工业部所颁布的“公私营煤矿暂行管理办法”、“土采煤窑暂行处理办法”及“公私营煤矿安全生产管理要点”，应该暂行停止执行，责成煤炭工业部重新加以研究修定。各省、自治区、直辖市应该根据本地区的具体情况拟定发展小煤窑的管理办法。
    2、根据统筹兼顾、适当安排的方针，凡煤炭供应不足，而又有煤炭资源的地区，应当根据自产自销的原则，由县（市）人民委员会、农业合作社或手工业合作社就地开采小煤窑以解决当地民用和工业用煤。但在煤炭资源丰富有发展前途的矿区内建设小煤窑的时候，省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会必须会同煤炭工业部所属的地区管理局作出规划，妥善安排以便和长远发展相结合。
    3、对现有国营和地方国营矿区内正在生产的小煤窑，亦应该加以规划，划定范围进行开采，如确实对国营或地方国营煤矿的发展影响较大的，省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会应该和煤炭工业部的地区管理局研究解决，采取有限制的开采，不得轻易封闭。
    4、为了充分利用煤炭资源，避免引起自燃灾害，各地区应该对小煤窑加强指导，尽可能地提高回采率，注意防止将粉煤碎煤遗弃在井下，只采厚煤不采薄煤等现象发生。
    5、注意小煤窑开采的组织经营工作。各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会应该对开采地区内乡与乡、社与社之间的关系问题妥善的加以安排。
    6、对小煤窑的安全生产问题，必须引起足够的重视。每处小煤窑必须有两个出口，在生产过程中，尽可能地采取必要的安全措施，并加强对工人的安全教育工作。凡有季节性生产的小煤窑，停止生产的时候，应该做好井口密闭工作，恢复生产的时候，应该采取防止窒息事故的措施。
    为了达到安全生产的目的，各级工业主管部门应该对小煤窑加强指导，定期检查小煤窑的安全情况，并给以具体帮助。
