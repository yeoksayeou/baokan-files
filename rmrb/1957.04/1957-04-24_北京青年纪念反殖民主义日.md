Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd: Five thousand youths from all walks of life in Beijing gathered today to commemorate Anti-Colonialism Day. More than 600 international students from nineteen countries studying in Beijing also participated in the meeting.

    Guan Shixiong, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Youth Federation, said at the meeting that the Bandung Spirit has had a profound impact on the people of Asia, Africa, and even the entire world. Last year, the people of Asia and Africa responded to the barbaric aggression of Britain, France, and Israel against Egypt with resolute support for the Egyptian people's struggle. Since World War II, the total population that has freed itself from colonial status worldwide has reached 1.2 billion. In short, the era we are in is an era of continuous victories against colonialism and the continuous retreat of colonialism. He said that Chinese youth will always sincerely sympathize with and support the anti-colonial struggles of youth from all countries.

    Wan Taihe, Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Student Federation, and representatives of international students from Egypt, India, Indonesia, the Soviet Union, and other countries also spoke at the meeting.

    北京市民主青年联合会副主席关世雄在会上讲话说，万隆精神已经在全亚非以至全世界人民中发生了深远的影响。去年，全亚非人民用坚决支持埃及人民斗争的行动，回答了英、法、以对埃及的野蛮侵略。第二次世界大战以来，全世界摆脱了殖民地地位的人口总数达到了十二亿。总之，我们所处的时代是反殖民主义不断取得胜利、殖民主义节节败退的时代。他说，中国青年将永远地衷心同情和支持各国青年反殖民主义的斗争。
