Relying on the Masses Provides Solutions
By our reporter Xiang Cun

The agricultural cooperatives in the Xu Village district of Wenshang County, Shandong Province, have a very urgent need for small farm tools this year. According to the district supply and marketing cooperative, the entire district needs more than 33,800 small farm tools (of which 86% are iron farm tools and 14% are wooden farm tools), an increase of 67.5% compared with the actual supply in the same period last year.

This year, there is a general shortage of raw materials for iron products, making it very difficult to supply such a large quantity of farm tools. However, the Xu Village District Supply and Marketing Cooperative, after making every effort, finally successfully guaranteed the supply.

How did this supply and marketing cooperative help farmers solve the problem of small farm tools? The main approach was to help agricultural cooperatives organize iron and wood craftsmen to produce some simple small farm tools and to repair existing farm tools as much as possible. For example, the Heping Agricultural Cooperative in Nanzhan Township needed to add 3,019 small farm tools before the wheat harvest this year, but the supply and marketing cooperative helped repair 716 damaged farm tools within the agricultural cooperative. In addition, it organized the agricultural cooperative to process and make 1,518 farm tools such as manure rakes. The above two items accounted for about 70% of the total number of farm tools needed by the agricultural cooperative. As for farm tools that could not be solved due to technical or raw material reasons, such as sickles and hoe blades, they were solved by relying on the supply and marketing cooperative to purchase goods. The raw materials for agricultural cooperatives to make their own farm tools mainly came from mobilizing the masses of commune members to take out scrap iron and wood. The supply and marketing cooperative provided more help and encouragement to agricultural cooperatives that could produce more small farm tools. For example, in addition to meeting its own needs, the Li Yin Agricultural Cooperative can increase the production of 3,330 small farm tools such as ox shuttle heads, shovel handles, spade handles, and sickle handles, which are all sold to other agricultural cooperatives by the supply and marketing cooperative.

According to statistics, from February to March 20, in the past fifty days, more than 10,300 small farm tools have been repaired in the entire district, and more than 6,600 small farm tools have been processed and manufactured. This has strongly supported agricultural production.

In order to help agricultural cooperative members solve the problem of funding for purchasing small farm tools, the supply and marketing cooperative also specifically helped agricultural cooperatives develop a variety of sideline production according to local conditions. For example, the supply and marketing cooperative lent the reeds it purchased to the semi-labor force of the agricultural cooperative to weave mats. According to statistics from February 5 to March 20, agricultural cooperatives engaged in sideline production such as weaving mats, weaving rush bags, and processing vermicelli and rice sheets (using sweet potato flour), increasing the total income of the district by more than 77,200 yuan, with an average income of 6 yuan and 2 jiao and 2 fen per household, solving the problem of funds for purchasing small farm tools.

    依靠群众就有办法
    本报记者　向村
    山东汶上县徐村区各农业社，今年对小农具的需要十分迫切。据区供销社统计，全区共需小农具三万三千八百多件（其中铁制农具占86％，木质农具占14％），比去年同期实际供应数增加67.5％。
    今年，铁制品原料普遍缺乏，供应这样大数量的农具实有很多困难。但是徐村区供销社经过千方百计的努力，终于出色地保证了供应。
    这个供销社怎样帮助农民解决小农具的？主要是帮助农业社组织铁、木工匠生产一部分简易的小农具，并尽可能修补原有的农具。如南站乡和平农业社，今年麦收前需增添小农具三千零十九件，但供销社却在农业社损坏的农具中，帮助修补好七百十六件，另外组织农业社加工自制粪扒等农具一千五百十八件，以上两项即占农业社所需农具总数的70％左右。至于因技术或原料不能解决的农具，如镰刀、锄板等，依靠供销社进货解决了。农业社自制农具的原料，主要是发动社员群众自己拿出废铁和木料，对有可能多生产小农具的农业社，供销社则给予更多的帮助和鼓励。如李尹农业社除解决自己的需要外，可以增产牛梭头、锨杆、铲杆、镰刀柄等小农具三千三百三十件，这些农具都由供销社负责推销给其他农业社。
    据统计，自2月至3月20日的五十天中，全区已修补好小农具一万零三百多件，加工自制出的小农具有六千六百多件。有力地支持了农业生产。
    为了帮助农业社社员解决购买小农具资金的困难，供销社还具体帮助农业社因地制宜地开展了多种副业生产。例如，供销社把采购来的苇子，贷给农业社的半劳力编制席子。据2月5日至3月20日统计，各农业社编席子、编蒲包、加工粉条和粉皮（用地瓜面）等副业生产，全区增加收入七万七千二百多元，平均每户收入六元二角二分，解决了购买小农具的资金。
