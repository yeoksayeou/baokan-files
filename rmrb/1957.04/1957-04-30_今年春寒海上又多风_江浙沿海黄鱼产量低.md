    Market Watch
    This year, the spring is cold and there are frequent winds at sea, resulting in low yellow croaker yields in coastal Zhejiang and Jiangsu.
    During this fishing season, it is difficult for Shanghai residents to buy yellow croaker, and even when they do, the price is higher than last year. What is the reason for this? The main reason is that the weather has been too cold since the beginning of spring, and there have been frequent winds at sea. We know that catching yellow croaker is best when the seawater reaches 13℃—15℃, but this year the seawater temperature has been around 10℃, so fishermen are working very hard at sea, but the harvest is small.
    Last April, over 220,000 dan of yellow croaker were available in Shanghai. From April 1st to 23rd this year, the amount arriving was less than half of last year's, and a small portion of that has to be transported to Beijing, the Northeast, and other places, which has created a tight supply in the Shanghai market.
    Due to the reduced output, the purchase price has increased accordingly. Otherwise, it would affect the fishermen's livelihood and enthusiasm for production. Consumers, I believe, are able to understand these circumstances. Wu Li

    今年春寒海上又多风  江浙沿海黄鱼产量低
    在这鱼汛的季节，上海市民很难买到黄鱼，即使买到一些价钱也比去年贵。这是什么原因呢？主要是入春以来气候过冷而且海上多风。我们知道，捕捉黄鱼宜于在海水达到13℃—15℃的时候，今年海水却在10℃左右，因此渔民在海上作业十分辛苦，而收获量不大。
    去年4月，上海市上市黄鱼达到二十二万多担，今年4月1日至23日到货不及去年的一半，其中还有一小部分要运往北京、东北等地，这就形成上海市场销售紧张。
    产量减少，收购价格因此有了提高，否则就会影响渔民的生活和生产情绪，这些情况想消费者是能够体谅的。　　吴立
