    Saving Labor, Improving Quality
    Tianmen County Vigorously Promotes New-Style Farm Tools
    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: (By Xinhua News Agency reporter Wei Sheng) Tianmen County, Hubei Province, a place with more land than people, has many agricultural cooperatives currently producing improved farm tools capable of saving labor. At present, each township is holding improved farm tool exhibitions, observing each other's work and exchanging experiences in production and use.

    The Unity Fourth Agricultural Cooperative of Xuhuang Township, selected as a model cooperative in Hubei Province for achieving a bumper harvest last year through improving various farm tools, has recently received many carpenters, blacksmiths, and technicians from agricultural cooperatives in various regions who have come to visit and learn about the production of improved farm tools. This cooperative has an average of more than seven mu of land to cultivate per laborer. Originally, transporting manure and harvesting relied entirely on carrying by shoulder, and there was also a lack of fertilizer and firewood, so a shortage of labor was a prominent difficulty. Last year, after finding the key, more than a dozen carpenters in the cooperative successfully modified and imitated 11 kinds of improved farm tools, such as weeding cultivators, cotton row markers, and cotton and wheat strip seeders, freeing up a large amount of manpower to invest in intensive farming and diversified operations, thereby achieving an unprecedented bumper harvest. Last year, the CPC Tianmen County Committee paid attention to encouraging and supporting agricultural cooperatives interested in improving farm tools, and as a result, dozens of different sizes of improved farm tools appeared throughout the county one after another. Among them, ten kinds of improved farm tools, such as handcarts, windmills for irrigation, weeding cultivators, improved double-barrel sprayers, and cotton and wheat strip seeders, have been proven through a year of use to be simple, easy to implement, and very effective. Therefore, it has been decided this year to vigorously promote these improved farm tools throughout the county.

    Currently, improved farm tool committees have been established from the county to the township level, and agricultural cooperatives have established improved farm tool groups to strengthen leadership over this work.

    节省人力　提高质量
    天门县大力推广新式农具
    新华社讯　新华社记者蔚生报道：湖北省地多人少的天门县，许多农业社正在制作能够节省人力的改良农具。现在各乡普遍举办改良农具展览会，互相观摩，交流制作和使用的经验。
    去年以改良多种农具获得大丰收、被选为湖北省模范社的徐黄乡团结第四农业社，这几天接待了很多前来参观和学习制作改良农具的各地农业社的木工、铁匠和技术员。这个社平均每个劳动力要种地七亩多，原来送粪、收割全靠肩挑，肥料和柴火又缺乏，所以劳动力不够是个突出的困难。去年，社里的十多个木匠经过找窍门，改制和仿制成功中耕锄草器、棉花划行器和棉麦条播器等十一种改良农具，使大批人工节省出来投入精耕细作，搞多种经营，因而得到了空前大丰收。去年，中共天门县委员会曾注意鼓励和支持有兴趣改良农具的农业社，因而全县先后出现了几十种大小不同的改良农具，其中手推车、风力水车、中耕锄草器、改良双管喷雾器和棉麦条播器等十种改良农具，经过一年来的使用证明简单易行，效果很好。因此，今年决定在全县大力推广这些改良农具。
    现在从县到乡都成立改良农具委员会，农业社成立改良农具小组，加强对这一工作的领导。
