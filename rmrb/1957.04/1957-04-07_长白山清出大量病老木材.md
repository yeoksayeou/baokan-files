Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, April 6th: The work of clearing the forest farms in the Changbai Mountain area has been completed. This winter, a total of more than 400,000 cubic meters of timber was cleared.

In the resource-rich Changbai Mountain forest area, there are a large number of diseased, rotten, dead, and over-mature old trees. In order to improve the sanitary environment of the forest area, accelerate the growth of young trees, and provide timber to the country in advance, the Jilin Provincial Forestry Department organized farmers near the forest area to harvest these trees after the autumn harvest last year. Now a large amount of timber has been transported down the mountain, and is being shipped out by train in a steady stream.

    长白山清出大量病老木材
    新华社长春6日电　长白山区清理林场工作已经结束。今年冬季共清理出四十多万立方公尺木材。
    在资源丰富的长白山林区，有着大量的病腐、枯死林和老龄过熟林木。吉林省林业厅为改善林区卫生环境，加速幼林生长，提前供给国家木材，从去年秋收以后就组织林区附近农民采伐这些林木。现在大批的木材已经运到山下，正由火车源源外运。
