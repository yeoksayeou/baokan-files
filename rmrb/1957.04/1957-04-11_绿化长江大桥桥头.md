　　Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 9th - In the past week, nearly 10,000 trees have been planted on both sides of the approach bridge of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, including Sophora japonica, Robinia pseudoacacia, Liquidambar formosana, Platycladus orientalis, Catalpa ovata, and Paulownia tomentosa. These trees were planted by the staff of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau in their spare time. Soviet bridge experts working here also participated in the tree planting activities to commemorate the friendly cooperation between Chinese and Soviet bridge builders in the Yangtze River Bridge project.
　　Greening the bridgehead area of the Yangtze River Bridge is an integral part of the construction of the Yangtze River Bridge project. The bridge builders had planned to plant 16,000 trees in their spare time around the Qingming Festival. Areas where construction is currently underway and where trees cannot yet be planted will continue to be greened in the autumn.
　　In order to complement the Yangtze River Bridge, the Wuhan municipal urban construction department is also preparing to carry out a number of beautification facilities on both sides of the bridgehead, including the reconstruction of the Yellow Crane Tower and the construction of a bridgehead park on the famous Tortoise Mountain. In the future, this area will not only be a thoroughfare for north-south traffic, but also a beautiful tourist area.

　　绿化长江大桥桥头
    新华社武汉9日电　最近一星期内，武汉长江大桥的引桥两侧栽植了近万株绿树，其中有小叶槐、刺槐、枫香、侧柏、楸树和梓树等。这些绿树是武汉长江大桥工程局的职工利用业余时间种植的。在这里帮助工作的苏联桥梁专家也参加了植树活动，来纪念中苏桥梁建设者在长江大桥工程中的友谊合作。
    绿化长江大桥桥头地区是建设长江大桥工程的组成部分之一。桥梁建设者们曾经计划在清明前后利用业余时间植树一万六千株。现在正在施工一时还不能植树的地区，将在秋天继续绿化。
    为了同长江大桥相陪衬，武汉市的城市建设部门也准备在两岸桥头进行若干美化设施，包括重建黄鹤楼和在有名的龟山建设桥头公园等。未来的这一带不仅是南北交通的孔道，同时也将是一个美丽的游览区。
