    Facilitating Enrollment for Farmers' Children, Labor Education, and Participation in Production Activities
    Shaanxi Many Rural Primary Schools Affix Junior High School Classes
    (Our Dispatch) Our reporter Zhu Bo reports: Shaanxi Province's development of secondary education is oriented towards rural areas. Many counties have achieved great success by attaching junior high school classes to complete primary schools in rural areas. According to statistics, 104 complete primary schools in 47 counties (cities) across the province have attached junior high school classes, totaling 208 classes, accommodating 12,572 students.
    Attaching junior high school classes to complete primary schools is a new form of secondary education. Its greatest advantage is that it facilitates enrollment for the children of the broad masses of working people in rural areas, facilitates education combined with labor production, and facilitates students' participation in labor production after graduation. The junior high school classes attached to complete primary schools in various places are all located in rural areas or remote mountainous regions. Some have more than 100 students, while others have 40 or 50. Some counties have established 15 or 16 classes, enrolling nearly 1,000 students. Complete primary schools in various places attach junior high school classes in accordance with the principle of diligence and thrift in running schools. Generally, they utilize the original school buildings (transforming the original complete primary school into a two-part system) or construct some new school buildings. The average basic construction cost per student is about 20 yuan (the basic construction cost for a junior high school student in a regular middle school requires more than 500 yuan). The students enrolled are all from villages near the school, with very few boarding students. The boarding students mostly live in houses belonging to agricultural cooperatives, and the students eat meals at the homes of local classmates. Therefore, the cost for students is much lower than that of ordinary middle schools. In cities, the cost of food alone for a middle school student is more than ten yuan per month, while the cost of food for boarding students in attached junior high school classes is only about seven yuan. This is very beneficial for the children of farmers, especially those from poorer families. Moreover, because students in attached junior high school classes live close to home, they can participate in agricultural production activities outside of their study time.
    The academic performance of students in attached junior high school classes is no lower than that of students in regular middle schools, and some students even outperform students in regular middle schools. For example, the Fufeng County Education Section conducted a test on students from the county middle school and four attached junior high school classes. The average score of students from the county middle school was over 60 points, while the average score of students from the attached junior high school classes was over 70 points. Another example is Chang'an County's test of students from the attached junior high school class (totaling 120 students) at Jiangcun Complete Primary School in arithmetic and literature. In literature, 93% scored 4 points or above, and 7% scored 3 points. In arithmetic, 87% scored 4 points or above, and 12% scored 3 points. Only one person failed. The good academic performance of students in attached junior high school classes is mainly due to the active and responsible teachers and the students' hard work. Most of the teachers in attached junior high school classes are selected from complete primary schools and then undergo training. These teachers have teaching experience, and after being selected to serve as middle school teachers, they are particularly active and responsible in both teaching and tutoring work. For example, if there are no experimental instruments, the teachers personally go to the county middle school to borrow them; they also specifically help students who are struggling with their studies to catch up. Most of the students in attached junior high school classes are outstanding young people from rural areas. Encouraged by their families and through their own efforts, their attitude towards learning is very down-to-earth, and they make rapid progress.
    Due to the above-mentioned advantages, attached junior high school classes are generally welcomed and supported by the masses of farmers. They say that this is truly their own school; having a middle school at their doorstep is something they never dreamed of in the past. In particular, poor peasants, who originally did not have the means to support their children to study in the city, are particularly happy that their children can now study in local attached junior high school classes. Therefore, many difficulties encountered in building schools with attached junior high school classes are resolved with the help of the local masses. For example, problems such as classrooms, student accommodation, and meals are all solved with the help of agricultural cooperatives. Mian County decided to attach a junior high school class to Yuandun Primary School and decided to build some new houses; however, the funds were not allocated at that time. After the nearby agricultural cooperative learned about this, they took the initiative to lend money to the school and sent someone to buy timber and prepare square stones from other places. In this way, the houses for the junior high school class were quickly built. In particular, farmers in mountainous areas, who in the past had difficulty even sending their children to primary school, now even have middle schools, and they are very grateful to the People's Government. They helped build the school, and after classes started, many people visited the school. They said that this is the first step in building the mountainous areas!
    Although attached junior high school classes have so many benefits, some people in the education departments of Shaanxi Province and counties believe that attached junior high school classes have poor equipment and incomplete curriculum, and do not look like regular middle schools. Therefore, some people advocate merging the junior high school classes into regular middle schools, or merging several attached junior high school classes into a regular junior middle school. This view is particularly evident in the recent reports from various counties. It should be said that this view ignores the actual situation and lacks a mass perspective. The facts listed above have fully demonstrated that attaching junior high school classes to complete primary schools in rural areas is in line with the needs of the masses. Currently, the country does not have the strength to run more middle schools to meet the masses' demand for sending their children to school. Since attached junior high school classes are welcomed and supported by the masses, reduce the economic burden on the masses for sending their children to school, solve the problem of students' further education, and reduce the burden on the country, is this not a win-win situation? Especially this year, the establishment of attached junior high school classes in complete primary schools in Shaanxi Province is one of the ways to tap existing potential and give play to the enthusiasm of the masses in running schools, which can appropriately solve the problem of further education for rural youth. Therefore, in the future, instead of merging or abolishing attached junior high school classes, the question is how to further develop them using existing conditions.
    The curriculum and equipment of attached junior high school classes do have difficulties, but these difficulties can be overcome. Under the current circumstances, attached junior high school classes should offer as many courses as possible (the courses that are currently not offered in various places are mostly physical education, music, history, etc.), and wait until conditions are ripe to offer all the courses. We should not demand regularization, uniformity, and comparison with ordinary middle schools in cities everywhere. Generally speaking, junior high school classes should add agricultural courses, because graduates of junior high school classes will mainly engage in agricultural production in the future. Of course, we cannot restrict the students of junior high school classes from pursuing further education. As for the issue of equipment, it can also be resolved. The way to solve it is to first purchase some of the most urgently needed equipment and gradually increase it. Moreover, we can also adopt the method of sharing a set of equipment in a region, such as experimental instruments. A region can purchase a set, and all junior high school classes can borrow it.
    Attached junior high school classes are still in the trial stage, and some problems will inevitably occur. However, as long as the relevant departments study carefully and rely on the masses, these problems can be solved, and attached junior high school classes will surely be run even more perfectly.

### 便于农民子女入学　便于进行劳动教育　便于参加生产活动  陕西许多农村小学附设初中班

    便于农民子女入学　便于进行劳动教育　便于参加生产活动
    陕西许多农村小学附设初中班
    本报讯　本报记者朱波报道：陕西省中等教育的发展面向农村，许多县在农村完全小学内附设初中班，取得了很大的成绩。据统计，全省有四十七个县（市）的一百零四所完全小学附设了初中班，共有二百零八个班，容纳了一万二千五百七十二名学生。
    在完全小学内附设初中班，是中等教育中一种新的形式。它的最大优点是便于农村广大劳动人民的子女入学，便于结合劳动生产进行教育和学生毕业后便于参加劳动生产。各地完全小学附设的初中班，都是设在农村里或者是偏僻的山区。学生多的有一百多人，少的有四、五十人。有的县设了十五、六个班，招考近千名学生。各地完全小学都按照勤俭办学的原则附设初中班，一般都是利用原有的校舍（把原来的完全小学改为二部制），或新建一部分的校舍，平均一个学生的基本建设费二十元左右（正规中学的一个初中生的基本建设费需要五百多元），招收的学生都是本村附近村庄的学生，住宿学生很少，住宿的学生也多是住的农业社里的房子，学生吃饭是在当地同学家包饭。因此，学生的费用比起普通中学要少多了。在城市里，一个中学生仅伙食费每月就要十几元，而附设初中班住宿学生的伙食费只七元左右就够了。这对农民特别是较贫苦的农民的子女学习是非常有利的。不仅如此，附设初中班的学生因为离家近，他们在学习的时间以外，还可以参加农业生产活动。
    附设初中班学生的成绩，也不低于正规中学的学生，有些学生的成绩还超过了正规中学的学生。如扶风县教育科对县立中学和四个附设初中班测验的结果，县立中学的学生平均分数是六十多分，附设初中班的学生的平均分数是七十多分。又如长安县测验江村完全小学附设的初中班（共一百二十人）学生的算术和文学的成绩，在文学方面得四分以上的占93％，三分的占7％，在算术方面得四分以上的占87％，三分的占12％，只有一人不及格。附设初中班学生学习成绩好，主要是教员积极负责和学生刻苦学习。附设初中班教员大部分是从完全小学中选拔的，然后经过培养训练。这些教员都有教学经验，他们被选派担任中学教员后，无论对教学和辅导工作，都特别积极负责。如没有实验仪器，教员们就亲自跑到县立中学去借；对那些功课差的同学，就专门帮助他们补习。附设初中班的学生，大部分是农村中的优秀青年；在家庭的鼓励和自己的努力下，他们的学习态度非常踏实，进步很快。
    由于初中班具有上述优点，普遍受到农民群众的欢迎和支持。他们说，这真是自己的学校；中学办在家门上，是过去作梦也想不到的事。特别是贫农，本来没有条件供养自己的子女到城市读书，现在子女能够在本地附设初中班读书，感到特别高兴。因此，附设初中班在建校中遇到的很多困难，都在当地群众帮助下解决了。例如教室和学生住宿、吃饭等问题，都是农业社帮助解决的。沔县决定在元墩小学附设初中班，并决定新建一些房子；但是，当时经费却没拨下来。附近的农业社知道以后，就主动地把钱借给学校用，并派专人到外地购买木材和打好了方石。这样，初中班的房子很快就建起来了。特别是山区的农民，过去子女连上小学也有困难，现在连中学都有了，心里十分感激人民政府。他们帮助建校，开课以后有很多人参观学校。他们说，这是建设山区的第一步呀！
    附设初中班虽然有这样多的好处，但是在陕西省和县的教育部门中，有些人却认为附设初中班设备差，课程不齐全，不像个正规中学的样子。因此，有人主张把初中班并到正规中学里去，或者把几个附设初中班合并成一所正规的初级中学。这种意见在各县最近的报告里表现得特别明显。应该说，这种意见是忽视实际、缺乏群众观点的表现。上面列举的事实，已经充分说明在农村完全小学里附设初中班是符合于群众的要求的。目前，国家还没力量办更多的中学来满足群众送子女入学的要求。附设初中班既然受到群众的欢迎和支持，减轻群众送子女入学的经济负担，解决学生升学问题，又减轻了国家的负担，这岂不是两全其美的事情吗？尤其是今年，陕西省完全小学附设初中班，是挖掘现有潜力，发挥群众办学积极性的办法之一，可以适当解决农村青年升学的问题。因此，今后不是并掉或撤消附设初中班，而是如何利用现有的条件再发展的问题。
    附设初中班的课程和设备是有困难的，但是，这些困难是可以克服的。在目前的情况下，附设初中班能开多少课程就开多少课程（目前各地未开的课程大都是体育、音乐、历史等课），等到有条件时再把课程开齐全，不应强求正规，强求一律，处处同城市普通中学去比。一般地说，初中班应该增设农业方面的课程，因为初中班毕业生将来主要是从事农业生产，当然也不能限制初中班的学生升学深造。至于设备的问题，也可以解决。解决的办法是，目前最迫切需要的先购买一些，逐渐增加。而且还可以采取一个地区共用一套设备的办法，如实验仪器，一个地区购置一套，各个初中班都可以去借用。
    附设初中班目前还在试办阶段，一定会发生一些问题。但是，只要有关部门好好研究，依靠群众，这些问题是可以解决的，而且，也一定会使附设初中班办得更加完善。
