　　Rain Clears, Distinguished Guest Arrives
　　Around 10 a.m. yesterday, Chairman Voroshilov arrived at the National Agricultural Exhibition by car. The rain had just stopped, and the sun was shining brightly. The fountain in front of the exhibition hall, along with the red banner above the entrance written in both Chinese and Russian, "Welcome Comrade Voroshilov, Envoy of the Great Soviet People," shone brightly in the sunlight, making the jubilant square even more vibrant. As the distinguished Soviet guest, accompanied by Comrade Liu Shaoqi, stepped out of the car, thunderous applause and cheers of "Long live! Long live!" immediately surrounded them. Voroshilov waved to the welcoming crowd and, surrounded by enthusiastic visitors to the exhibition, entered the exhibition hall.

　　The Correct Path
　　In the General Pavilion, the introduction to China's agricultural cooperation aroused great interest in Voroshilov. When Comrade Liu Shaoqi spoke to him about the speed of China's agricultural cooperation, Voroshilov said: "Yes, this is dialectical, these are the two aspects of the contradiction: poverty is not good, but poverty also stimulates the development of cooperation."

　　Voroshilov's face always showed a smile when he saw every exhibit related to the achievements of cooperation and heard every number related to the achievements of cooperation. When Liu Ruilong, Vice Minister of Agriculture, pointed to a chart and explained: Chairman Mao Zedong said that cooperation is the direction for China's 500 million peasants. Voroshilov immediately continued: "The correct path! If this problem is solved, socialism will be guaranteed." Comrade Liu Shaoqi nodded frequently in agreement.

　　The distinguished guests then saw exhibits on the prevention and control of crop pests on another row of exhibition stands. Voroshilov repeatedly inquired with great concern about what methods we have to eliminate pests and the situation of pest elimination nationwide. Finally, he half-jokingly pointed to the pest specimens and said, "These are all counter-revolutionaries in agriculture and should be resolutely eliminated!"

　　Learn From Others' Strengths
　　When visiting the corn section, Voroshilov talked about the United States. He said that the United States, especially Canada, grows a lot of corn. With abundant corn feed, animal husbandry will be developed. Of course, the United States is our enemy in terms of ideology, but we should also learn from their good things.

　　Heartfelt Encouragement
　　In the Forestry Pavilion, a model picture of "Building the mountain areas richer and more beautiful" attracted Voroshilov. He pointed to the lush trees and beautiful houses and said to Comrade Liu Shaoqi, "This is communism."

　　"It will take many years to become like this, because trees are not easy to grow," said Comrade Liu Shaoqi.

　　"No, I don't think it will take that long," Voroshilov said. "Communists are very resourceful."

　　Friendship Everywhere
　　The great friendship between China and the Soviet Union is everywhere, and the sunflowers in the exhibition hall are also evidence of it. Look, those are sunflowers of the Soviet "Saratov" variety. Voroshilov picked up a sunflower seed and tasted it, and said meaningfully: In Russian, sunflowers are called "ПОДСОЛНЕЧНИК," which also means "towards the sun," just like you.

　　He was very interested in the growth of peanuts. He also said, "We can eat your peanuts, and we have to thank you for that."

　　The distinguished guests stopped at a place marked "Fragrant grass covers the ground, four harvests a year." The lemongrass exhibited here is a high-yielding tropical crop, and Soviet friends are probably unfamiliar with it. Comrade Liu Shaoqi picked a lemongrass leaf and gave it to the distinguished guests, who smelled it and praised it. Chairman Voroshilov put a lemongrass leaf in his pocket, wanting to take this fragrant leaf back, just as he wanted to bring the deep friendship of the Chinese people to Soviet friends.

　　Voroshilov's Humor
　　Laughter always followed the distinguished guests. Voroshilov used his hearty laughter and amusing words to immerse every hall of the exhibition in joy.

　　In front of the flue-cured tobacco exhibition stand, he offered advice to smokers. He said that the exhibition stand could state: "Whoever wants to live ten or twenty years less should smoke more." In front of the mountain fire schematic diagram in the Forestry Exhibition Hall, he mentioned smoking again. He said that the mountain fire probably happened because smoking friends casually threw unextinguished cigarette butts.

　　One female commentator was blushed by Voroshilov's humor. Voroshilov pointed to the pointer in her hand and asked: What is this stick for, is it not used to hit people?

　　On an exhibition stand in the State Farm Pavilion were several rubber boots. Voroshilov asked, "How much yield per mu?" Liu Ruilong, the Vice Minister next to him, replied: "We have not calculated this."

　　Voroshilov saw a large sweet potato weighing one hundred and sixteen catties, and he said: "There is no way to steal this away!" This sentence caused a burst of laughter.

　　Precious Tree Seeds Presented to Distinguished Guests
　　At 2:30 in the afternoon, the distinguished guests were about to say goodbye. Jin Shanbao, the Director-General of the General Pavilion, held a delicate lacquer box, carrying several special agricultural products of our country, and presented them to Chairman Voroshilov as gifts. The box contained ten seeds of the carving patterned Mianqie tree. There is only one Mianqie tree in the entire China, growing in Maoming County, Guangdong, and has been alive for more than three hundred years.

　　Chairman Voroshilov took the gift and said excitedly: Dear comrades! The respect in the depths of my heart for the Chinese people is difficult to describe in words. We, whether we have been to China or not, deeply know that the Chinese people are hardworking and wise. The people of our two countries are brothers in struggle, brothers who share weal and woe. We have made such achievements in a short period of time, which is fundamentally impossible in capitalist countries.

　　Chairman Voroshilov then praised the organization and design of the exhibition. Finally, he congratulated everyone.

    伏老参观全国农业展览会
    雨过天晴贵宾来
    昨日上午十时许，伏罗希洛夫主席乘汽车到达全国农业展览会。这时恰是阵雨过后，艳阳照临。展览馆门前喷水池的水花，同门楣上用中俄文写着“欢迎伟大苏联人民的使者——伏罗希洛夫同志”的红色标语，在明媚的阳光下互相辉映，使欢情洋溢的广场更加显得动人。当苏联贵宾在刘少奇同志陪同下走出汽车的时候，春雷似的鼓掌声和“万岁——万岁”的欢呼声，立刻包围了他们。伏老向欢迎的群众招手致意，在热情奔放的展览会参观者的簇拥下走进了展览馆的大门。
    正确的道路
    在综合馆中，关于我国农业合作化的介绍引起了伏老很大的注意。刘少奇同志向他谈到我国农业合作化的速度时，伏老说：“是的，这是辩证的，这是矛盾的两个方面：穷是不好的，但穷也刺激了合作化的发展。”
    伏老看到每一件关于合作化成果的展品，听到每一个关于合作化成果的数字，脸上总是呈现着微笑。当农业部刘瑞龙副部长指着一幅图表解释说：毛泽东主席说，合作化是我国五亿农民的方向。伏老立刻接着说：“正确的道路！这个问题解决了，社会主义就有了保证。”刘少奇同志频频点头，表示同意。
    贵宾们随后又在另一列展览台上看到了防治农作物害虫的展览品。伏老非常关切地一再询问我们有些什么消灭害虫的办法以及全国消灭害虫的情况。最后他半开玩笑地指着害虫的标本说：“这些都是农业中的反革命，应当坚决把它们消灭干净！”
    学习别人的长处
    参观玉米的时候，伏老谈到了美国。他说，美国，特别是在加拿大，玉米种植得很多。有了丰富的玉米饲料，畜牧业就会发达。当然，美国在思想体系上是我们的敌人，但是他们有什么好东西，我们也是应当学习的。
    亲切的鼓励
    在林业馆，一幅“把山区建设得更加富饶美丽”的模型图吸引了伏老。他指着苍翠的树林和漂亮的房舍，对刘少奇同志说，这是共产主义。
    “还得很多年才能变成这个样子，因为树木长起来不是容易的。”刘少奇同志说。
    “不，我看用不了那么长时间。”伏老说，“共产党人是很有办法的。”
    处处是友谊
    中苏两国的伟大友谊无所不在，展览馆里的向日葵也是它的证据。看，那是苏联“萨拉托夫种”的向日葵。伏老拿起一粒葵花籽尝了一下，同时意味深长地说：俄国话把向日葵叫做“ПОДСОЛНЕЧНИК”，也有“向日”的意思，同你们一样。
    他对花生的生长情况很感兴趣。他还说，我们能吃到你们的花生，这要感谢你们。
    在标着“芳草遍地，一年四收”的地方，贵宾们停下来了。这里展出的香茅是一种产量很高的热带作物，苏联朋友对它大概是很生疏的。刘少奇同志摘下一片香茅叶子给贵宾们，他们嗅着，赞赏着。伏罗希洛夫主席把一片香茅叶放到衣袋里，他要把这芳香的叶片带回去，正像他要把中国人民的深厚友谊带给苏联朋友一样。
    伏老的幽默
    欢笑声一直跟随着贵宾们。伏老用他那爽朗的大笑和逸趣横生的话语，使展览馆的每个大厅都浸沉在欢乐中。
    在烤烟展览台前，他对爱抽烟的人提出了忠告。他说，展览台上可以写明：谁要是想少活十年、二十年，谁就应当多抽烟。在林业展览馆的山火示意图前，他又一次提到抽烟。他说，山火怎样发生的，大概是因为抽烟的朋友随便抛掷没有熄灭的烟蒂吧。
    有一位女讲解员被伏老的幽默弄得满面绯红。伏老指着她手中的指示棒问道：这棍子是做什么的，不是用来打人的吧？
    国营农场馆的一个展览台上放着几只胶靴。伏老问：“每亩产量多少？”他旁边的刘瑞龙副部长回答道：“这个我们可没有计算过。”
    伏老看到一株重达一百一十六斤的大甘薯，他说：“这可没办法偷走了！”这句话引起了哄堂大笑。
    珍贵树种赠贵宾
    下午两点半，贵宾就要告别了。总馆长金善宝同志捧着一个精致的漆盒，带着几件我国农业特产，向伏罗希洛夫主席赠礼。盒子里摆着十颗雕刻着花纹的缅茄树的种籽。缅茄树在全中国只有一棵，生长在广东茂名县，已活了三百多年了。
    伏罗希洛夫主席接过了礼物，激动地说：亲爱的同志们！我心灵深处对中国人民的敬爱是难以用语言来形容的。我们无论到过和没到过中国的人都深深知道，中国人民是勤劳的、智慧的。我们两国人民是斗争中的兄弟，是同甘共苦的兄弟。我们在短短期间就作出了这样的成果，这在资本主义国家是根本办不到的。
    伏罗希洛夫主席接着夸赞了展览会的组织和设计工作。最后并向大家祝贺。
