The current situation of Japanese national culture, as I understand it, can be summarized in the following points:

I. The majority of Japanese traditional culture has not yet become the common wealth of all Japanese people.
II. The Japanese ruling class has established the ideology of "worshipping Western culture and despising national culture."
III. Japanese national culture, whether it has already become the wealth of all the people or has not yet become the wealth of all the people, is being vigorously maintained by the people. The part of national culture that has already become the wealth of all the people is constantly fighting against the enemies of peace and reactionary forces.

Our national culture, with a history of two thousand years, has been deeply influenced by the national culture of our neighboring country, China, which has a history of four thousand years, but Japanese national culture also has many unique features. Architecture, sculpture, painting, literature, philosophy, folk songs, music, dance, etc., all fields have many unique things. Such as Kabuki, Noh, Kyogen, "Bunraku," painting represented by Sesshu, Japanese dance, Sumo wrestling, and "Manyoshu," etc. I think China also knows about these traditional national cultures, but all this has not become the wealth of all Japanese people, and many things are unknown to the poor Japanese working people. For example, the "Manyoshu" and most ancient Japanese literary works are unknown to the working people. The world-famous Noh, Kyogen, ancient famous paintings, etc., are also completely out of reach for the vast Japanese working people.

This is because the vast Japanese working people are under the exploitation of American capital and Japanese monopoly capital, and they have no time, no economic conditions, and no necessary knowledge to transform ancient Japanese national culture into their own. Before capitalist society, in feudal and slave societies, the majority of Japanese working people were also in a position of being exploited and oppressed, and had no access to national culture. For example, the Kabuki Grand Theater in Tokyo today is the palace of Japanese Kabuki art, and everyone in Japan wants to see a play there. Japanese wealthy merchants can enter and leave this palace of art day and night, using it as a social venue; while workers and farmers have the wish to see a play there once in their lifetime, but nine out of ten die without their wish being fulfilled. This means that without liberation from capitalist society, national culture cannot become the wealth of all Japanese people.

Another reason that hinders Japanese national culture from becoming the wealth of the Japanese people is the idea of worshipping Western Europe and despising one's own national culture, which still stubbornly remains in all classes of Japan today. Since the Meiji Restoration about eighty years ago, due to the absorption of Western European civilization, capitalism has developed rapidly, and the Japanese ruling class has established a trend in the Japanese intellectual class that "Western culture is good in everything, and one's own culture is bad in everything." Therefore, the culture of the Japanese intellectual class and the culture of the workers and peasants are separated from each other. Japanese urban culture and rural culture are also separated from each other. For example, in terms of music, the Japanese intellectual class and the bourgeoisie only know Western European music; while the workers and peasants only know Japanese music. Such divisions can be seen everywhere. For example, a landlord's son graduates from a university in Tokyo and becomes a researcher of French literature, but when he returns to the village, he has nothing to do with the culture of the village, so he is kept at a distance by the countryside, and he himself abandons his hometown. Such situations are also commonplace.

This state of division of national culture among the Japanese people may be said to be a reflection of the essence of capitalism. The Japanese ruling class and the United States have skillfully used this point. During the war, the national culture, which was mostly preserved in rural areas, was distorted and used as a tool for chauvinism and xenophobia, and was used to serve fascism; after the war, the trend of despising national traditions and worshipping the West was used to promote American rule.

However, the Japanese people have now begun to notice this situation. Especially among the Japanese intellectual class, the examination and reflection on the idea of despising national culture has been greatly strengthened. Recently, led by Kato Shuichi and others, many intellectuals have begun to participate in the discussion of this issue. This issue, that is, the trend of unconditionally worshipping Western European culture and despising national culture, contains the particularity of modern Japanese history and is very deeply rooted. This trend also has a strong base in the Japanese progressive camp.

But, despite this, the Japanese people have always protected the national culture that is enough to be proud of. The puppet show "Bunraku," composed of Joruri and Shamisen music, is one example; in rural areas, there are still many arts that melt folk songs, dances, and music into one furnace. These arts have gone through thousands of years and have been preserved to this day. Despite the obliteration and oppression of political forces in various eras, the singing method of folk songs, the movements of dances, the playing of flutes, and the beating of drums have been passed down from the elderly in the village to the young people, generation after generation.

Chinese readers must also know that there is the largest volcano in the world in Kyushu, Japan, called Mount Aso. I was born at the foot of this mountain, and I spent a period of my youth as a worker in a hydroelectric power station in this mountain. It was already an old story thirty years ago. In this mountain, we young people learned ancient Japanese songs and dances. At that time, Japanese youths had the view that if they did not learn one of the songs, dances, or music, they would not be favored by girls, and they would not become a good man. I was originally clumsy and could not learn dances or music, so I had to learn songs. The stand for the songbook was called "Mi-dai." The teacher, an old woman, sat on the other side of the "Mi-dai," put the shamisen on her lap, and sang to us while playing. We disciples sat on this side of the "Mi-dai," looking at the songbook and paying attention to the teacher's mouth shape, practicing singing. "To enjoy the spring flowers, go to Asukayama..." It was simply a mess. If we sang off-key, the teacher would use the plectrum (a hard thing made of cow bone, etc.) to tap our heads "bang, bang." In this way, after several bumps swelled up on my head, I finally learned to sing a few songs. Today, American films with noisy accompaniment music have gained a dominant position, but despite this, if you go to the alleys of the city and the countryside, you will definitely hear and see ancient Japanese songs and dances. These traditional arts are loved by the working people, and many are still preserved to this day.

There is a song that is sung while dancing:

"Stay here tonight...The shoji screen has just been re-papered...The bathtub is heated up...Take off your straw sandals and rest..."

This is a song that sings the warm reception of the inn maid for the dusty traveler returning from a long journey. The inn maid, with wide kimono sleeves tied with red ribbons and a red apron tied to her front, unties the guest's straw sandals while trying to comfort the guest's travel fatigue. This song sings this sincere feeling. Chinese friends, please come to Japan to travel! Japanese girls who are ten times better than me will sing and dance for you to see.

Japanese national culture is essentially peace-loving and hates war. Therefore, it was suppressed by the ruling class who launched the war of aggression during World War II. Although many have been changed or silenced, there are also many who have resisted and fought. Take Tanka as an example. Tanka is the shortest art form in the world with only thirty-one characters. It has been circulating in Japan since 1,700 years ago, and the Japanese people have been accustomed to using this form to sing their feelings since ancient times. During the Sino-Japanese War and the Pacific War, Japanese soldiers who were pulled into the war of aggression often sent letters from the battlefield to their wives and compatriots in their hometowns with this kind of Tanka (especially those sent back from China), totaling 60,000 poems. Because of the officer's inspection, many more were torn up and thrown away after being written, and there may actually be hundreds of thousands of poems. Under the inspection system, although anti-war songs cannot be sung directly, the expression of human true feelings is directly linked to opposing war. Here are a few excerpts. Chinese friends, please regard this as the true voice of the Japanese people!

○ Although the photo is stained with sweat, it is broken and unbearable to see, but the sweet smile is still there, and I don’t want to be exposed to the wilderness.
○ Chinese people are busy transplanting rice seedlings, thinking of their hometown, and their wives are hoeing in the fields.

The first poem describes the feelings of a soldier looking at the wrinkled and sweat-stained photo of his wife in his military uniform pocket, unwilling to die in the war of aggression; the second poem describes the feelings of a soldier who was born as a farmer, seeing Chinese farmers transplanting rice seedlings, and thinking of his wife hoeing in the fields in his hometown.

Tanka is a short writing form that has been passed down from generation to generation by the ancestors of the Japanese people and is easy to learn. Therefore, many Tanka poems have been produced in the struggle against American military bases and in the struggle to defend peace and oppose the exploitation of capitalists. For example, the young people of Okinawa created a collection of songs "Dawn Clouds" in the struggle against the atomic bomb base in Okinawa, and a collection of songs "Songs of the Base" was also produced in the struggle against the Otakane US military base in Yamagata Prefecture, and so on. Last year, Japanese progressive poets Watanabe Junzo and Nobuo Sumiko selected excellent works from a large number of Tanka poems created by workers and farmers across Japan and compiled a collection of songs "Japanese Workers in Tanka," which is regarded as a major achievement in recent Japanese literature. This collection of songs has also been given to the Chinese Writers Association. If it can be translated and introduced to Chinese readers, it will help to understand how Japanese workers and farmers are living now. Here are two or three of them.

Railway worker's song by Nagano Yoshimitsu
○ Grasping a little bit of time to stop the car, as if someone is chasing behind, swallowing food!

Textile worker's song by Nishikawa Mitsue
○ I don't want to fight, I don't want to fight, but the thread I knit is used for military equipment.

Farmer's song by Seki Isao
○ The landlord came, threatening to take back the land, and left after saying that, I couldn't sleep with my wife all night.

Please let the translator explain the meaning of the above three songs, and I will stop my article here.

March 1957

Translator's note: The author gave the translator a topic at the end of the article, so I have to reluctantly explain the three Tanka poems quoted at the end of the article. Tanka, or simply called song, is a unique literary style in Japan, similar to Chinese Ci or Xiaoling, consisting of five, seven, five, seven, and seven characters. But occasionally there are those who slightly deviate from this rule. Those who are good at writing this kind of Tanka are called Kajin. Japanese Tanka or Haiku, like Chinese poetry, are concise and meaningful, and are extremely difficult to translate. Several forms are used in the article to translate, just to achieve the meaning, and maybe the "meaning" is not well "achieved." The first song at the end of the article uses the scene of railway workers grasping a little bit of free time during the car stop to swallow food greedily, vividly and implicitly writing the heavy labor and hard life of railway workers; the second song writes the contradictory feelings of textile workers who hate war but have to engage in work that serves the rearmament due to the pressure of life. These few words reveal the conscience of Japanese working women who are groaning under the heavy pressure of life; the third song writes the scene of the landlord coming back to ask for land, causing the farmers' panic, and discussing with his wife until dawn, unable to sleep all night. It is difficult to determine whether the land to be taken back here is the deprivation of tenancy or the reclamation of land divided during the land reform. Because the land reform implemented in Japan after the war stipulated that the village landlords still had to keep about one cho-bu (equal to a little over 0.99 hectares) of land, so there are still small land lessors in Japan; from this point of view, it may be the deprivation of tenancy. However, after the land reform, it is not uncommon for Japanese landlords to carry out things like "turning back." In any case, the farmer's panic and sad feelings depicted in this Tanka poem are vividly on paper, and it also reveals the incompleteness of the Japanese post-war land reform in attacking feudal forces through this point.

### 日本民族文化的现状

    日本民族文化的现状
    日本　德永直
    我所理解的日本民族文化的现状，简单说来，有如下几点：
    一、日本传统文化的大部分还没有成为日本全体人民的共同财富；
    二、日本统治阶级树立了“崇拜西洋文化，蔑视民族文化”的思想；
    三、日本的民族文化，无论其中已经成为全体人民财富的部分，或尚未成为全体人民财富的部分，都受到人民的极力维护；民族文化中已经成为全体人民财富的部分，经常在同和平的敌人、反动势力进行着斗争。
    具有两千年历史的我们的民族文化，深受具有四千年历史的邻国、中国的民族文化的影响，但日本民族文化中也有很多独特的东西。建筑、雕刻、绘画、文学、哲学、民谣、音乐、舞蹈等等，各领域中都有很多独特的东西。如歌舞伎、能、狂言、“文乐”、以雪舟为代表的绘画、日本舞蹈、角力以及“万叶集”等等，这些传统的民族文化，我想中国也是知道的，但这一切并没有成为日本全体人民的财富，很多东西是穷困的日本劳动人民所不知道的。例如，“万叶集”以及日本古来的大部分文学作品，劳动人民就都不知道。闻名世界的能、狂言、古代的名画等等，对于日本的广大劳动人民也是完全无缘的。
    这是因为日本的广大劳动人民，处于美国资本和日本垄断资本的盘剥之下，没有时间、没有经济条件、也没有必要的知识准备，来把日本古来的民族文化化为自己的东西。在资本主义社会以前，在封建社会、奴隶制社会中，日本的大多数劳动人民，也处于受剥削、受压迫的地位，无从接近民族文化。举例来说，现在东京的歌舞伎大戏院，是日本歌舞伎艺术之宫，日本每个人都想到那里去看看戏。日本的豪绅巨贾可以朝朝夕夕出入于这个艺术之宫，把它作为社交场所；而工人和农民怀着一生中能有一次去那里看看戏就于愿足矣的愿望，十中有九却到死不能如愿以偿。这就是说，不从资本主义社会中解放出来，民族文化是不可能成为日本全体人民的财富的。
    阻碍日本民族文化成为日本人民大众财富的，还有另一个原因，这就是今天仍顽强地残存于日本各阶级中的崇拜西欧、轻视自己民族文化的思想。大约八十年前，明治维新以来，由于吸收了西欧文明，资本主义有了迅速发展，日本统治阶级就在日本的知识阶层中树立了这样一种风气，即认为“西洋文化什么都好，自己的文化什么都糟”。因而，日本的知识阶层的文化和工人、农民的文化是彼此割裂开来的。日本的都市文化和农村文化也是彼此割裂开来的。例如，就音乐来说，日本的知识阶层和资产阶级，只知道西欧音乐；而工人、农民只知道日本音乐。诸如此类的割裂状态，到处都可以见到。再如，一个地主子弟从东京的大学毕业，成了法国文学研究者，他回到村里却和村里的文化毫不发生瓜葛，这样他就为农村敬而远之，他本人也离弃了故乡，这类情况也是司空见惯的。
    这种民族文化在日本人民中的割裂状态，也许可以说本来就是资本主义本质的一种反映。日本统治阶级和美国都曾巧妙地利用了这一点。战争中，把较多地保存在农村等地的民族文化，加以变质，加以歪曲，使之成为国粹主义、排外主义的东西，曾利用它来为法西斯主义服务；战后，又利用了蔑视民族传统、崇拜西洋的风气，使之有利于推行美国的统治。
    然而，现在日本人民已经开始注意到这个情况了。特别是在日本知识阶层中间，对于轻视民族文化思想的检讨、反省，已大大加强。最近，由加藤周一等人带头，许多知识界人士都开始参加了这个问题的讨论。这个问题，即无条件地崇拜西欧文化、蔑视民族文化的这种风气，包含着日本近代历史的特殊性，是非常根深蒂固的，这种风气在日本进步阵营中也有着强大的地盘。
    但，尽管如此，日本人民却一直保卫了足以夸耀于人的民族文化。以净琉璃和三弦音乐构成的木偶戏“文乐”，即其一例；在农村，还保存了许许多多熔民谣、舞蹈、音乐于一炉的艺术，这些艺术经历了千年岁月，一直保存到今天。尽管受到各个时代政治势力的抹杀、压迫，而民谣的唱法、舞蹈的动作、笛子的吹法、鼓点的打法等等，还是从村里的老人传向青年，子孙代代地传了下来。
    中国的读者想必也都知道，日本九州地方有一座世界第一的大火山，叫作阿苏山。我就是出生在这个山麓，在这个山里的水力发电站作为一名工人度过了青年时代的一个时期的。已经是三十几年前的老话了，就在这个山里，我们这些青年曾学习过日本古来的歌谣和舞蹈。当时日本青年有一种看法，认为在歌谣、舞蹈或音乐中，如果不学会其中的某一种，就得不到姑娘的垂青，而且也不成其为一个好样的男子汉。我本来生性笨拙，舞蹈、音乐都学不来，只好学习歌谣。放歌本的台子，叫作“见台”，教歌的师傅、一个老太婆坐在“见台”的那一面，把三弦放在膝上，一面弹奏，一面唱给我们听。我们这些徒弟，坐在“见台”这面，一面看着歌本，一面注意着师傅的口型，练唱。“赏春花要去飞鸟山啊……”简直搞得焦头烂额。唱走了味，师傅就用弹三弦的拨子（用牛骨之类作的硬家伙），“梆梆”地敲脑袋。就这样，在脑袋上肿起了几个包之后，我终于也学会唱几支歌了。今天，美国电影之类带有噪杂的伴奏音乐的影片，已经取得了压倒的优势地位，尽管如此，到都市的小巷和农村去，你一定还能听到和看到日本古来的歌谣和舞蹈，这些传统艺术受到劳动人民的爱护，保留到今天的仍有很多。
    有这样一支边舞边唱的歌：
    “要住宿就住下吧……槅扇新近重糊啦……澡盆烧热啦……解下草鞋歇歇吧……”
    这是歌唱旅店侍女对于风尘仆仆、远路来归的投宿客人的殷勤接待的歌。宽大的和服袖子用红带子束了起来、前襟上系了红围裙的旅店侍女，一面给客人解草鞋的带子，一面设法来慰籍客人的旅途的疲劳。这支歌就是歌唱这种恳切心情的。中国的朋友们，请到日本来游历吧！有比我高明十倍的日本姑娘们将会唱给你们听，舞给你们看的。
    日本的民族文化，在本质上，是爱好和平，厌憎战争的。所以第二次世界大战中它受到了发动侵略战争的统治阶级的压制。因此而改头换面或沉默下去的固然有很多，但进而进行抵抗，进行斗争的，也有不少。试举短歌作为一例。短歌是只有三十一个字的世界上最短的一种艺术形式，从一千七百年以前就在日本流传下来，日本人民自古以来就惯于用这种形式来咏情抒怀。中日战争、太平洋战争期间，被拉进侵略战争的日本士兵，从战地寄给故乡妻子、同胞的信里，常常有这种吟咏自己心情的短歌（特别是以从中国寄回者为多），其数目共达六万首。由于军官的检查，写好之后，撕掉、扔掉的，还要多几倍，实际上可能有几十万首。在检查制度下，虽然不能正面吟咏反战的歌，但是那种人的真情的流露，是直接通向反对战争的。这里抄出一两首来，中国的朋友们，请你们把这看作是日本人民的真实的心声吧！
    ○照片虽汗污，破皱不堪睹，嫣然笑容在，不愿曝尸骨。
    ○中国百姓插秧忙，想故乡，妻子操锄田畦上。
    第一首写的是，看着在军服口袋里揉皱了的、汗渍斑斑的妻子的照片，不愿在侵略战争中死掉的士兵的心情；第二首写的是，看到中国农民在插秧，同样出身于农民的士兵，思念在故乡锄地的妻子的心情。
    短歌是日本人民祖先代代传流下来的，很容易学习的一种短小的写作形式，因此，现在在反对美国军事基地的斗争中，在保卫和平、反对资本家的剥削的斗争中，都产生了很多短歌。例如，冲绳青年们在反对冲绳的原子弹基地的斗争中，创作了歌集“晓云”，在反对山形县大高根美军基地的斗争中，也产生了一本歌集“基地之歌”，等等。去年日本的进步歌人渡边顺三和信夫澄子，从日本全国工人、农民所创作的大量短歌中，选出优秀之作，编了一本歌集“短歌里的日本劳动者”，被视为最近日本文学的一大收获。这部歌集也赠给了中国作家协会，如果能翻译出来，介绍给中国读者，当会有助于理解日本工人、农民现在过着怎样的生活的。这里先介绍其中之二三。
    铁路工人的歌　长野义光作
    ○抓紧一丁点的停车时间，仿佛谁在后面追赶似的，猛吞饭啊！
    纺织女工的歌　西川美津枝作
    ○不愿意打仗，不愿意打仗，可是结的线啊，却要用到军备上。
    农民的歌　关　勇夫作
    ○地主老爷来，扬言要收地，说罢扬长去，与妻喁喁不成寐。
    上面三首歌的意思，且请翻译者加以说明，我的文章就此打住吧。
    1957年3月
    译者附记：作者在文末给译者出了个题目，所以不得不勉为其难，对文末所引的三首短歌稍加解释。短歌，或简单地称为歌，是日本固有的一种文学样式，类似中国的词或小令，由五、七、五、七、七言构成。但间或亦有稍稍逸出这一规律者。擅长写这种短歌的，则被称为歌人。日本的短歌或俳句，正如中国诗词一样，言简而意味隽永，本极难译，文中用了几种形式来译，只是求其达意而已，也许“意”也没有“达”好。文末的三首短歌，第一首用抓紧停车时的一点点闲空，狼吞虎咽地用饭这一场景，生动而含蓄地写了铁路工人的劳动的繁重和生活的艰苦；第二首写出了厌恶战争的纺织女工，为生活所迫不得不从事为重整军备服务的工作的矛盾心情，这短短的几句话，透露了呻吟在生活重压之下的日本劳动妇女的良知；第三首写地主回来要地，引起农民的惶恐，和妻子商量到天明，终夜不能成寐的情景。这里所说的要地，究竟是夺佃，还是索取土地改革中分掉的土地，较难断定。因为日本战后实行的土地改革，规定在村地主仍得保守一町步（等于零点九九公顷强）左右的土地，所以日本仍有小土地出租者；从这方面看，可能是夺佃。但土地改革后，日本地主实行“翻把”之类的事也不是没有。不管怎样，这首短歌所描绘的农民的那种惶恐凄然之情却跃然纸上，它通过这点也透露了日本战后的土地改革对于封建势力的打击的不彻底性。
