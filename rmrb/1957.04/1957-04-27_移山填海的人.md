    The People Who Move Mountains and Fill Seas
    Ren Lizhang

    Can mountains be moved? Can seas be filled? Moving mountains and filling seas are only miracles in myths; however, today, this has become a reality.

    The color documentary film "Moving Mountains and Filling Seas," produced by the August First Film Studio, truly and vividly showcases the tremendous labor of the builders of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway in moving mountains and filling seas.

    The subject of this documentary is people, but it is not a simple reproduction of people's activities. It focuses on depicting the power of people's labor and the enthusiasm for creation. It concentrates on showing: what kind of people are these, and how did they create such a mythical miracle?

      The protagonists in "Moving Mountains and Filling Seas" are the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army Railway Corps. This heroic road-building force, victorious in a hundred battles, today, in days of peaceful construction, in order to help the people of Fujian enter a happy socialist society as soon as possible, once again fearlessly and arduously accepted the glorious task assigned to them by the motherland - to urgently build the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway.

      "With road-building heroes here, no mountain can refuse to bow its head." This heroic declaration has become the force that encourages the soldiers to overcome difficulties. Singing the song "…Wherever the railway is most difficult to build, we send our railway soldiers…" they tread the road soaked with the blood of Red Army soldiers and imprinted with their footprints, to establish meritorious service for the motherland. Finally, after more than a thousand days and nights, they created a rare miracle in the world, realized the fifty-year-long wish of the people of Fujian and overseas Chinese, and built the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway.

    The film prominently portrays the flesh-and-blood relationship between the people and the army, inseparable as flesh and blood or fish and water. This is precisely the source of the power to move mountains and fill seas, because the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway is the crystallization of the joint labor of the people and their sons and brothers under the leadership of the Party.

    Many touching events emerge before our eyes: Red Army soldiers who fought here more than twenty years ago have now returned to their hometown to participate in construction; an old woman who made sandals for the Red Army more than twenty years ago is now leading young women to make sandals for the construction army. People have created advanced working methods such as the swing-bucket earth-moving method and the automatic earth-transporting method; people throw stones into the sea several meters deep, and people build a ten-mile-long dike on the shores of the turbulent sea. The wisdom and labor of countless people have converged into an unstoppable force, bravely impacting the mountain peaks and fighting the ocean. And in the midst of intense labor, there are also interesting things happening from time to time. For example, the predicament of the builders trapped on the beach after the tide went out aroused laughter from the audience. This laughter shows people's trust in them, because people know that they will definitely overcome difficulties and achieve a satisfactory ending.

    The film is nearing its end. When we see the soldiers installing the last fishplate, nailing the last rail spike, and connecting the last rail, our mood becomes even more uplifted and excited. Because from the event of repairing the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway portrayed in the film, we are greatly encouraged: we believe that we have the power to overcome nature.

    移山填海的人
    任丽璋
    山能移吗？海能填吗？移山，填海，那只是神话里才有的奇迹；可是，在今天，这却成为事实了。
    八一电影制片厂摄制的彩色纪录影片“移山填海”，就真实而又生动地展现了鹰厦铁路的建设者们的移山填海的巨大劳动。
    这部纪录影片所描写的对象是人，然而又不是对人的活动的简单的复写。它着力于描写人的劳动的魄力和创造的热情，它集中表现的是：这是怎样的人，他们怎样才创造出神话般的奇迹。
      “移山填海”中的主人公是我们的人民解放军铁道兵部队的战士们。这支百战百胜的英雄筑路部队，今天在和平建设的日子里，为了帮助福建人民早日进入幸福的社会主义社会，又不畏劳苦、不畏艰难地接受了祖国交给他们的光荣任务——抢建鹰厦铁路。
      “有了筑路英雄在，高山那能不低头。”这句英雄的豪语，成为鼓舞战士战胜困难的力量。他们唱着“……那里的铁路最难修，就派我们的铁道兵……”的歌子，踏着渗透着红军战士鲜血和印有红军战士脚迹的道路，为祖国建立功勋。终于在经历了一千多个日日夜夜以后、创造出世界上少有的奇迹，实现了福建人民和海外侨胞五十年的愿望，建成了鹰厦铁路。
    影片突出地表现了人民和军队之间的骨肉相连、鱼水不分的血肉关系。这正是能移山填海的力量的泉源，因为鹰厦铁路是在党的领导下，人民和他的子弟兵，共同劳动所产生的结晶。
    许多感人的事情涌现在我们眼前：二十多年前在这里作过战的红军战士，现在又回到故乡参加建设了；二十多年前，曾给红军做过凉鞋的老妈妈，现在又领导青年妇女为建设大军做凉鞋了。人们创造了秋千倒土法、自动运土法等先进工作方法；人们向深达数公尺的海里抛石头，人们在惊涛掠岸的海边筑起了十里长堤。无数的人的智慧和劳动，汇集成了一股不可阻遏的力量，勇猛地向山峰冲击，同海洋搏斗。而在紧张的劳动之中，也不时有着有趣的事情出现。譬如退潮以后，被困在沙滩上的建设者们所处的窘境就引起了观众的笑声。这笑，说明了人们对他们的信任，因为人们知道他们一定会战胜困难，获得完满的结局的。
    影片快结束了。当我们看到战士们装上最后一个夹板，钉上最后一颗道钉，接好最后一根钢轨的时候，我们的心情也随之愈加振奋、激动起来。因为从影片表现的修鹰厦铁路这一事件中，我们受到极大的鼓舞：相信自己有力量战胜大自然。
