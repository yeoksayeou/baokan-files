Small Investment, Fast Speed, Big Effect
Jilin and Seven Other Provinces Develop Small Coal Mines

(Reported by our newspaper) Jilin, Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong, Anhui, Zhejiang, and Sichuan provinces plan to restore, renovate, and build a large number of small coal mines this year. Once these small coal mines are put into production, they will play a significant role in meeting the coal needs of local people's lives and urban industries. For example, Hebei Province, based on the province's widespread coal resource conditions, will build and restore 150 small coal mines managed by agricultural cooperatives in more than 20 counties in the most fuel-scarce remote mountainous areas and grassland areas this year. When all these small coal mines are put into production, the annual output can reach 450,000 tons, which can basically meet the needs of farmers, herdsmen, forestry people, and local handicraft production in these areas.

Restoring, renovating, and building small coal mines requires little money and yields quick results. Some small coal mines newly built and restored in mountainous and semi-mountainous areas such as Yanbian, Helong, Panshi, and Huinan in Jilin Province are close to railway lines, resulting in low transportation costs and easy coal transportation. The main materials and equipment needed for mine construction are all adjusted and resolved from local stagnant materials or idle assets. The two coal mines newly built in Guandi, Yanbian, and Helong, with an annual output of 50,000 tons, only require a total investment of 100,000 yuan, and can produce 32,000 tons of coal this year. The small coal mines restored and renovated in Sichuan Province generally only need to add some simple ventilation, lighting, and transportation equipment, strengthen the development of mine working faces, and add some workers to increase production. According to the investment effect of existing small coal mines, it generally only costs two or three yuan or even a few jiao to produce one ton of coal. For example, Jiangjin Special District will restore 38 old wells this year with an investment of 250,000 yuan, which can produce about 150,000 tons of coal. Tonghua Coal Mine in Qijiang County only needs to invest 20,000 yuan to produce 80,000 tons more coal.

### 投资少，速度快，效果大  吉林等七省发展小煤窑

    投资少，速度快，效果大
    吉林等七省发展小煤窑
    本报讯 吉林、辽宁、河北、山东、安徽、浙江和四川等省，计划在今年内恢复、改建和新建大批小煤窑。这些小煤窑投入生产以后，对于满足当地人民生活用煤和城市工业用煤，将起很大作用。例如河北省今年根据省内遍布各地的煤产资源条件，在燃料最困难的偏僻山区和草原地带二十多个县，建设和恢复一百五十个由农业社管理的小煤窑。这些小煤窑全部投入生产以后，年产量可达四十五万吨，能够基本满足这些地区农民、牧民、林区人民和地方手工业生产的需要。
    恢复、改建和新建小煤窑，花钱少，收效快。吉林省在延边、和龙、磐石和辉南等山区和半山区所新建和恢复的一些小煤窑，离铁路线近，运输成本低，煤炭便于外运，建矿所需的主要物资、设备，都由当地呆滞物资或闲置资产中调剂解决。在延边官地、和龙新建的两个年产五万吨的煤矿，总共投资只需十万元，今年就可以生产出三万二千吨煤。四川省恢复和改建的小煤窑，一般只需添增一些简单的通风、照明、运输设备，加强矿井工作面的开拓，增添一些工人，就可以增产。根据现有小煤窑的投资效果看，生产一吨煤一般只需二、三元钱甚至几角钱。如江津专区今年恢复三十八个旧井，投资二十五万元，就可产煤十五万吨左右。綦江县同华煤矿只要投资二万元，就可多产八万吨煤。
