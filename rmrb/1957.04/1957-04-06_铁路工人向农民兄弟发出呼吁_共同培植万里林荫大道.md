    Railway Workers Appeal to Farmer Brothers
    to Jointly Cultivate a Great Green Belt

    Since the Party issued the call to green the motherland, we railway workers have been actively planting trees, and are especially striving to realize the "Great Green Belt" along the Guangzhou to Manchuria railway line. The railway green belt will not only make the motherland more beautiful and protect the railway subgrade more firmly, but also benefit the countryside by regulating the climate and conserving water and soil. It is also of direct benefit to the farmer brothers. In principle, industry and agriculture should cooperate to ensure that railway afforestation truly achieves the expected results.

    Unfortunately, some farmers are arbitrarily cutting down trees. According to a report from the Wuchang Engineering Section of the railway, the section investigated the area from Yujiawan to Puqi station alone, and by mid-February, more than 2,900 trees had been cut down privately, most of which were useful timber. The felling phenomenon has not stopped so far.

    For the sake of national interests, I want to loudly appeal: Please, farmer brothers, do not cut down trees along the railway line any more, and please ask the local governments to educate the farmers, establish an overall point of view, and stop acts of harming the public interest for personal gain. At the same time, the railway engineering leadership organs should also do a good job of publicizing the protection of trees.

    At about 2:00 PM on March 16th, Comrade Yu Guangsheng, foreman of the Heilongcheng Road Maintenance District between Bamiancheng and Qujiadian, was inspecting steel rails on the line when he discovered a farmer felling trees next to the railway. These trees were planted by the railway bureau to protect the road. When Foreman Yu walked up to him, he saw that the farmer had already felled four large trees that were more than 250 millimeters thick, so he stopped him from cutting any more. The farmer who was cutting the trees said very confidently: "Why don't you let me cut trees? Don't I need firewood!" It is understood that this farmer lives in the nearby Lao Qujiadian Village and his name is Cai Jinghe. We plan to green both sides of the railway line, but if the farmer folks do not help us to protect the trees, it will be difficult for us to complete the task of greening the railway. I suggest that relevant departments should strengthen the education of farmers in protecting trees, to help us smoothly complete the task of planting trees and afforesting and greening the railway.

### 铁路工人向农民兄弟发出呼吁  共同培植万里林荫大道

    铁路工人向农民兄弟发出呼吁
    共同培植万里林荫大道
    党提出了绿化祖国的号召以后，我们铁路工人就积极栽培树木，并特别为实现由广州至满洲里铁路沿线的“万里林荫大道”而努力奋斗。铁路林荫大道不仅能使祖国变得更美丽；把铁路路基保护得更稳固；对于农村来说，也可以调节气候，保持水土。与农民兄弟也有直接的好处，照理，应当工农合作，使铁路造林真正收到预期的效果。
    可惜的是有些农民却在任意砍伐、据铁路武昌工务段报告，该段仅调查由余家湾至蒲圻站一带，截至2月中旬止，已被私自砍伐的树达二千九百多株，其中绝大部分是有用的成材。目前砍伐现象迄未停止。
    为了国家利益，我要大声疾呼：请农民兄弟不要再砍铁路沿线树木，并请当地有关政府教育农民，树立整体观点，制止损公利己的行为，同时，铁路工务领导机关，也应作好爱护树木的宣传工作。

    3月16日下午两点钟左右，八面城、曲家店间黑城子养路工区工长于广生同志，在线路上检查钢轨工作，发现一位农民在铁道旁伐树。这树是铁路局栽的护路树，于工长走到跟前一看，这位农民已经将二百五十多公厘粗的大树拉倒四棵了，便阻挡他不叫再伐。这位伐树的老乡很理直气壮地说：“为什么不叫我伐树？我没有柴烧吗！”据了解，这位农民是住在附近老曲家店村的，名字叫蔡景和。我们规划把铁路沿线两侧绿化起来，如果农民老乡们不帮助我们爱护树木，很难使我们完成绿化铁路的任务。我建议有关部门应向农民加强爱护树木的教育，来帮助我们顺利地完成植树造林绿化铁路的任务。
