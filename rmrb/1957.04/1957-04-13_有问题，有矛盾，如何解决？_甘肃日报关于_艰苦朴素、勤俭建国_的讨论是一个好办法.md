How to Solve Problems and Contradictions?
    ——The Discussion on "Hard Work, Simplicity, and Diligence in Building the Country" in Gansu Daily is a Good Method
    By our reporter Gu Lei
    *This article indicates that among a minority of workers in the Gansu region, some undesirable tendencies are beginning to emerge, such as focusing only on personal interests and disregarding overall interests, being overly concerned with immediate gratification and failing to see a brighter future, seeking only comfortable living and being unwilling to engage in arduous labor, and being undisciplined and neglecting labor discipline. These tendencies all reflect serious shortcomings in our work, such as neglecting political and ideological work and a bureaucratic style that is detached from the masses. Under the leadership of the provincial Party committee, Gansu Daily launched a discussion, using the method of the masses educating themselves, and correctly resolved these problems.*

    In recent months, the Gansu Daily editorial department has organized a discussion on "Hard Work, Simplicity, and Diligence in Building the Country" in the newspaper. Participants in this discussion included workers, technicians, staff, and primary and secondary school teachers. From February 26th to the end of March, dozens of articles were published.
    Why did Gansu Daily launch this discussion?
    Because, in the minds of some people in Gansu Province who live on wages, they don’t fully understand some fundamental issues. They don’t completely understand the correct relationship between developing production and improving material and cultural life. In addition, they don’t know how to calmly handle various contradictions that arise in work and daily life, so various problems arise. Some people feel that welfare facilities are too few and life is very inconvenient, and demand that the state greatly increase investment in welfare; some people are not satisfied with their current jobs and simply want to do work that is completely in line with their ideals; some people feel depressed and believe they have no future because they have not been promoted or received a pay raise; some people who have just started working in factories are not used to collective, disciplined life and regard violating labor discipline as a trivial matter; some people cannot stand the bureaucratic style of certain leading cadres in enterprises and institutions, and are particularly dissatisfied with the bureaucratic attitude towards workers' welfare, and want to eliminate this phenomenon all at once, sometimes inevitably adopting radical methods. The demands of these people are varied. Many of these demands are reasonable, and many, while impractical, are well-intentioned. Some demands are too high, too urgent, or unreasonable. For example, some people have proposed that the state issue "key construction subsidies," "universal promotion without examination," "receiving wages even for unwarranted absenteeism," and "refusing to work if leaders do not meet demands." This clearly shows that among a very small number of employees, some bad tendencies are beginning to occur, such as only taking care of personal interests and ignoring overall interests, being preoccupied with immediate enjoyment and not seeing a better future, only seeking comfortable life and not willing to engage in hard work, and being undisciplined and ignoring labor discipline.

    Where do the contradictions come from?
    The main reason for these contradictions in real life is that the Party organizations and the leaders of enterprises and institutions have underestimated the new situations brought about by the rapid development of various construction undertakings, and thus have relaxed political and ideological education. The Party's socialist construction policy is changing the economic landscape of Gansu Province. By the end of 1956, the total industrial output value of Gansu had increased by 8.7 times compared with 1949, and the proportion of modern industrial output value in the total industrial and agricultural output value had risen from 2.15% in 1949 to 17.8% now. With the development of various undertakings, the number of employees has increased from 50,000 to 300,000. Lanzhou City originally had no major industry and a population of only 200,000. Due to the construction of large factories, it will become a new industrial base, and the population has reached 650,000. The rapid growth of the workforce has complicated the composition of the working class. The Lanzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China conducted a survey of the individual components of 67,963 workers. The situation was: workers 27%, transferred soldiers 5.5%, farmers 45.1%, general citizens 2.8%, staff 1.48%, students from various class backgrounds 14.05%, landlords, rich peasants, former military officers, vagrants, etc. 4.2%, individual laborers 1.36%, and some people belong to other components or their components are unknown. Although this survey is not accurate, it reflects an important situation, that is, the vast majority of employees are new. They have not been educated in collective production, have not undergone the tempering of hard struggle, and have not lived a disciplined life, so they have brought many non-working-class consciousness and living habits into the working class. This new situation will inevitably increase the task of political and ideological education. However,
    Because the Party organizations and administrative leaders in enterprises, institutions, and schools are only busy grasping specific businesses and neglecting political and ideological education, how can problems not occur?
    Now, the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has begun to attach importance to political and ideological education. The recent propaganda work conference is another important step in strengthening this work throughout the province. As a collective propagandist and collective organizer of the Party, how to cooperate with this work is a very important matter. Is it just to publish a few editorials, talk about general principles, and criticize certain phenomena in general, or to openly present what is happening in real life and let everyone discuss, criticize mistakes, and establish correct ideas? Under the specific leadership of the provincial Party committee, the Gansu Daily editorial department adopted the latter method. This is the background and purpose of launching the discussion on "Hard Work, Simplicity, and Diligence in Building the Country." Judging from the many articles that have been published, the right and wrong of many things have become clearer and clearer, truth has emerged in the discussion, and the vast number of cadres and the masses have received a vivid education.

    Is it difficulty that conquers people, or people who overcome difficulty?
    First, the discussion pointed out that the bureaucratic style of being detached from the masses and not caring about the lives of the masses is incompatible with strengthening political and ideological education. Many articles pointed out that there is a bad trend in enterprises and institutions: things that the masses have reasonably requested and can be done are not actively done, and are procrastinated. Of course, there is even less talk of taking the initiative to do them; although the demands raised by the masses are reasonable, they cannot be done immediately because of current difficulties, and they are always ignored without explanation; when the masses raise excessive or unreasonable demands, they are not educated, but are rejected by crude and simple methods. A group of Shanghai workers came to the Lanzhou Refinery. One day, it rained, and the local workers put on their raincoats, and the workers from Shanghai also wanted to receive them, but the construction site said they were out. The workers ran to the warehouse and saw that there were still many, so they stopped working and said they would work after the raincoats were issued, and they finally received them. Therefore, one of them, named Chen Zhiqiang, wrote an article saying that to deal with bureaucrats, "problems will not be solved unless you make noise." For example, when some institutions, enterprises, and schools send people to other provinces to recruit people, they do not truthfully explain the certain difficult situations to the recruits, but boast about how good Gansu and Lanzhou are, how high the wages are, and how perfect the welfare facilities are. This kind of untrue statement will soon be exposed, producing a very bad impact. Some people have made suggestions to the leadership, but they have not been implemented or responded to, as if no one cares. Of course, they are very dissatisfied. On the contrary, as long as the difficulties are explained to the masses, the masses can understand and tolerate temporary difficulties. For example, the Northwest Wool Textile Factory, with the large increase in production personnel, the cooking equipment was not enough, and eating became a problem. Everyone could not eat on time, and this problem was not small, and the workers were also complaining. At this time, the leaders of the factory explained the difficulties to the workers, and patiently mobilized some female workers to endure the temporary inconvenience and asked them to go home and cook after get off work. The problem of eating was solved smoothly, and no one quarreled about it.
    At the same time, it can be seen in the discussion that the vast majority of employees are very reasonable. Some people have emphasized in their articles that since the leadership has bureaucracy and does not solve problems, they should make a lot of noise. However, the absolute majority of people do not agree with this view. These comrades have three reasons: (1) Some of the shortcomings of the leadership are indeed due to bureaucracy, but also related to lack of experience. They are serving the people. Therefore, their shortcomings should be overcome with the spirit of unity and mutual assistance to help the leading staff, and crude methods are not the correct attitude. (2) Quarreling, making noise, and absenteeism are the methods used by workers in the old society to fight against class enemies. Today, it is not appropriate to treat the leading staff in their own enterprises. (3) Who benefits from quarrels and noise? Most people believe that fighting and making noise will bring losses to production and construction, which is not good for the country, that is, not good for the cause of the working class, and not good for themselves, while the enemy likes this approach. Someone said: "Why do we do what the enemy likes!"
    The facts vividly educate the cadres, making them aware of the danger of being detached from the masses and the urgent significance of overcoming bureaucracy; at the same time, it also educates the masses on how to correctly treat the shortcomings of the leading staff. How to combine personal interests with collective interests?
    Second, since the leading staff does not care about the masses, it is naturally impossible to educate the masses on how to correctly handle the relationship between personal interests and overall interests, but in fact many problems happen here. During the discussion, someone said that "making a lot of noise is a destruction of collective interests," so some people published articles believing that personal interests cannot be combined with collective interests. Zhang Wenzhong, a 23-year-old construction worker, said that he "built tall buildings but lives in earthen houses and thatched huts," believing that he was losing his youth in desolate places and was busy for others, so he concluded: "The country's future is bright, but the individual's future is bleak." Zhu Zhili, a middle school teacher named Zhu Zhili, felt after seeing Zhang Wenzhong's article that his rank had been raised slowly and his salary income had not increased much, so he said: "The work of teachers is like candles or matches, illuminating others and destroying themselves!" At this time, the Gansu Daily editorial department asked everyone to pay attention to the discussion of this issue.
    In the process of discussion, although there were no lengthy speeches and no lengthy quotations from scriptures, three questions were discussed clearly.
    Take revolutionary martyrs as their role models
    (1) Many people believe that any kind of labor in our country is not only for individuals, but even more gloriously for the happiness of all the people. Chu Huaijun, a foundry worker at an automobile repair factory, said: "Did the revolutionary martyrs regard death as home and sacrificed gloriously for personal happiness! If everyone is like Comrade Zhang Wenzhong, can there be a new China!" Geologist Li Yongning, under the title "Take heroes as role models, the individual's future is bright and bright," said that he was afraid of difficulties when he first arrived in the field, cried, and wanted to go home. Later, he thought of the responsibilities of a young Communist League member, thought of the heroes Huang Jiguang and Dong Cunrui, calmed down, and worked enthusiastically. He said: "As long as you are brave enough to fight for the interests of the country, it is the greatest glory." A person named Li Bo refuted Zhu Zhili's point of view and said: "As long as a person is not pursuing personal gains and losses, but pursuing a real life purpose—serving the broad masses of the people—he will regard 'being able to illuminate others' as the greatest comfort, and also illuminate himself."
    Big rivers and small rivers are closely connected, and the small rivers will be full if the big river has water
    (2) Everyone discussed the correct relationship between personal interests and overall interests. Someone used the principle of "the small river will dry up if the big river has no water, and the small river will be full if the big river has water" to explain that without safeguarding the interests of the country, personal interests will lose their guarantee. At the same time, many articles mentioned the examples of production development and improvement of people's lives in the past few years, saying that socialist construction has closely combined the two, and cannot sacrifice long-term interests for current interests.
    Remember the old suffering and recognize the new happiness
    (3) Are there more or less welfare benefits at present? Many old workers wrote articles, tearfully recounting the suffering of workers in the old society, and joyfully explaining the welfare benefits enjoyed by workers today, which they could not even dream of in the past. Some people pointed out that it is a fact that some welfare benefits are not well done at present, but they cannot be said to be too few. If they are still dissatisfied with the current treatment and welfare benefits, they are really "not knowing happiness when they are in happiness!"
    This shows that the broad masses of people can know what kind of outlook on life they should have and how they should view the relationship between personal interests and overall interests through discussion.
    Third, the discussion also reflected that in the past, enterprises and institutions did not provide enough education to the masses on hard work and struggle. The reason why some people are blindly pursuing life enjoyment and always want to look to the highest standards in welfare is because they do not understand why they still need to work hard after the revolution has succeeded, and they do not know what kind of method to use to improve the living standards. However, through open discussion, everyone has clarified these two issues.
    The majority of people believe that when talking about improving life, they must think of the current difficulties of the country. Bai Yucai explained in the article "Be Considerate of the Country's Difficulties" that the country is carrying out socialist construction. Because the foundation was weak in the past, there will inevitably be difficulties, and these difficulties cannot be overcome all at once. There must be a process, and everyone should not make excessive demands, let alone demand that they be done immediately. Pan Depei advised everyone to "correctly understand the difficulties in the current economic life." He said: "If everyone disregards the country and only cares about personal interests, does not engage in production, only pays attention to life, and uses all the construction funds to improve life, socialism cannot be built, and personal life cannot be thoroughly improved." In the articles of other people, they all called on everyone to recognize the difficulties, endure some inconveniences in life, and concentrate their efforts on building socialism.
    Then, what method should be used to improve and improve the material and cultural living standards!钳工 Liu Ji'an believes that "it is difficult to enjoy happiness in happiness if you do not suffer hardship in hardship," and do not "always think about money, money, money. Only by working hard can you improve your life." Suo Guirong from the leather factory said: "If you want to drink water, you have to dig a well yourself." He said: "Some places with good conditions were all obtained by the hard work of the older generation. If you want to drink water, you can't wait for others to dig a well. No matter how hard it is, you have to do it yourself. If you want to live a socialist life, it is impossible to overcome difficulties and improve production." Dong Bojin said: "On what basis should we improve our lives? Only by continuously improving our technical and professional level and ensuring that we frequently break quotas and over fulfill production plans, this is an effective way to improve our lives."

    Distinguish right from wrong and strengthen unity
    Now, Gansu Daily continues to publish articles on "Hard Work, Simplicity, and Diligence in Building the Country" in the newspaper. This discussion will also involve the relationship between centralism and democracy, the relationship between discipline and freedom, so as to correct the incorrect use of the rights of centralism in some institutions and enterprises while neglecting democratic life and the tendency of extreme democratization among the masses, emphasize discipline while restricting certain freedoms of the masses, and the phenomenon of the masses not abiding by discipline. This discussion is exceptionally enthusiastic. The reason why it is so enthusiastic is that the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China strongly leads this discussion and has instructed Party organizations at all levels to mobilize the masses to participate in the discussion. Another factor is that what is being discussed is exactly what everyone cares about most, and it is a free discussion. Positive and negative opinions can be expressed, and reasons can be explained calmly. There is no satire or scolding, creating an atmosphere for everyone to speak their minds. According to the person in charge of the Gansu Daily editorial department, this discussion will continue for a period of time and will attract more people to participate. Such a large-scale and long-term discussion is undoubtedly a major event in the ideological construction of Gansu Province. Everyone knows that at present, the contradictions among the people in our country are the main contradictions. Correctly handling these contradictions will promote the development of socialist construction, otherwise it will harm the cause of socialist construction. The correct method for handling contradictions among the people is to start from the desire for unity, start from caring for comrades, carry out criticism and self-criticism, overcome shortcomings, and improve work. The discussion launched by Gansu Daily this time is in line with this principle. Therefore, although the two different opinions were sharp during the discussion process, it did not affect unity, but played a great educational role. Therefore, this method of public discussion is worth promoting.
    However, I think there is one shortcoming in this discussion, that is, the leading staff in various institutions, enterprises, and schools rarely express their opinions, and there is a lack of articles in which these leading staff openly examine their own shortcomings and express their determination to correct their shortcomings. I think that if the Gansu Daily editorial department can organize the leading staff of enterprises, institutions, and schools to examine bureaucratic styles, criticize the mistakes of being detached from the masses, and propose methods to strengthen ties with the masses and strengthen political and ideological education when organizing future discussions, the discussion on "Hard Work, Simplicity, and Diligence in Building the Country" will receive greater results.

    有问题，有矛盾，如何解决？
    ——甘肃日报关于“艰苦朴素、勤俭建国”的讨论是一个好办法
    本报记者　顾雷
    这篇文章表明：在甘肃地区少数职工中，开始发生一些只顾个人利益不顾整体利益，斤斤计较眼前享受看不到更美好的远景，只图生活舒适不愿意进行艰苦的劳动，自由散漫忽视劳动纪律等不良的倾向。这些倾向都反映出我们工作中存在着忽视政治思想工作的严重缺点，存在着脱离群众的官僚主义作风。甘肃日报在省委的领导下展开了讨论，用群众自己教育自己的办法，正确地解决了这些问题。
    最近一个多月来，甘肃日报编辑部在报上组织了“艰苦朴素、勤俭建国”的讨论。参加这个讨论的有工人、技术人员、职员、中小学教师等。从2月26日开始，到3月底，发表了数十篇讨论的文章。
    甘肃日报为什么要展开这个讨论呢？
    因为，目前在甘肃省靠工薪生活的一部分人的思想中，对某些根本性的问题还不十分了解，不完全懂得发展生产同改善物质文化生活的正确关系，加上不会冷静地处理工作和实际生活中出现的各种矛盾，于是就发生了这样或那样的问题。有的人觉得福利设施太少，生活很不方便，要求国家大量增加福利方面的投资；有的人对现有的工作岗位不满意，一味想去做完全合乎自己理想的工作；有的人因为没有升级、增加工资，便情绪低落，认为自己没有前途了；有的人新参加工厂工作，不习惯集体的、有纪律的生活，把破坏劳动纪律看作寻常小事；有的人看不惯企业、机关某些领导干部的官僚主义作风，特别不满意对工人生活福利上的官僚主义态度，想一下子消灭这种现象，有时难免采用了过激的办法。这些人的要求是各种各样的，其中有许多要求是合理的，有许多要求虽不实际但其动机是良好的，有些要求是过高、过急、或者是不合理的。例如，有人提出要国家发“重点建设补助”、“不考工普遍升级”、“无故旷工还要领工资”、“领导上不满足要求就不上班”等。这确实说明在极少数职工中，开始发生一些只顾个人利益不顾整体利益、斤斤计较眼前享受看不到更美好的远景、只图生活舒适不愿意进行艰苦的劳动、自由散漫忽视劳动纪律等不良的倾向。
    矛盾从何而来
    在现实生活中发生这些矛盾的主要原因，是党的组织和企业、机关的领导人员，对各项建设事业迅速发展所带来的新的情况估计不足，因而放松了政治思想教育工作。党的社会主义建设方针，在改变着甘肃省的经济面貌。到1956年底，甘肃的工业总产值比1949年增长八点七倍，现代工业产值在工农业总产值中的比重，由1949年的2.15％上升到现在的17.8％，随着各项事业的发展，职工数由五万扩大到三十万人。兰州市原来没有大的工业，人口不过二十万人，由于建设了大工厂，将变成新的工业基地，人口已达六十五万人了。职工队伍的迅速壮大，使工人队伍的成分复杂了。中共兰州市委员会曾对六万七千九百六十三个工人的个人成分进行了调查，情况是：工人27％，转业军人5.5％，农民45.1％，一般市民2.8％，职员1.48％，各种阶级成分出身的学生14.05％，地主、富农、旧军官、游民等4.2％，个体劳动者1.36％，另有一些人属其他成分或成分不明。这个调查虽不精确，却反映出一个重要的情况，即绝大部分的职工是新的，他们过去没有受过集体生产的教育，没有经受艰苦斗争的锻炼，没有过过有纪律的生活，便把许多非工人阶级的意识、生活习惯带到工人队伍中了。这个新的情况，势必加重了政治思想教育的任务。可是，
  由于企业、机关、学校中党的组织、行政领导人员只忙于抓具体业务，忽视了政治思想教育，怎么会不发生问题呢。
    现在，中共甘肃省委开始重视了政治思想教育工作，最近召开的宣传工作会议，是在全省范围内加强这一工作的又一重要步骤。作为党的集体宣传者、集体组织者的报纸，如何配合这一工作，是件很重要的事。是只发几篇社论，讲讲大道理，笼统地批判某些现象呢，还是把现实生活中发生的事情，公开摆出来，让大家讨论，批判错误、树立正确的思想呢？甘肃日报编辑部在省委的具体领导下，采用了后一种方法，这就是开展“艰苦朴素、勤俭建国”讨论的背景、目的。从已经发表的许多文章看，有许多事情的是非愈辩愈明，讨论中显出了真理，广大干部和群众受到了生动的教育。
    是困难征服人，还是人克服困难
    第一，讨论中指出了脱离群众、不关心群众生活的官僚主义作风，是同加强政治思想教育工作不相容的。不少篇文章都指出，在企业、机关里有一种坏风气：对群众提出的合理的、可以办到的事，不积极办，拖拖拉拉，当然更谈不上主动地去办了；群众提出的要求虽然合理，因为目前有困难，马上办不到，总是置之不理，也不作解释；遇到群众提出过高的或不合理的要求时，不向群众进行教育，用粗暴的、简单的方法加以拒绝。兰州炼油厂来了一批上海工人。一天，下雨了，本地工人都穿上了雨衣，上海来的工人也要领，工地上说没有了。工人跑到仓库一看，还有很多，于是便停止工作，说等发了雨衣再干，结果领到了。因此，其中一位叫陈志强的，便写了一篇文章，说对待官僚主义者“不吵不闹就是不解决问题”。又如，有的机关、企业、学校，派人到外省招人时，不是真实地向被招人员说明某些艰苦情况，而是一味吹嘘甘肃、兰州怎样好，工资高，福利设施完善等。这种不实事求是的说法，很快就会被揭穿，产生很不好的影响。有些群众向领导方面提了意见，既不见实现，也不见答复，似乎没有人理似的，他们当然很不满意。相反的，只要把困难向群众讲清楚，群众是能够理解的，也是能够忍受暂时困难的。例如，西北毛纺织厂，随着生产人员大量增加，灶具设备不够，吃饭都成了问题。大家不能按时吃上饭，这个问题并不算小，工人也是有埋怨情绪的。这时，厂的领导人员向工人说明了困难，并且耐心地动员一部分女职工忍受暂时的不便，请她们自己下班后回家做饭吃。吃饭的问题就这样顺利解决了，也没有人为这件事吵闹。
    同时，在讨论中可以看出绝大部分职工是很讲道理的。有些人曾在文章中强调，既然领导上有官僚主义，不解决问题，就应该大吵大闹。可是，绝对多数的人不同意这个看法。这些同志有三方面理由：（一）领导上的某些缺点，固然是由于有官僚主义，但也和经验不足有关。他们是为人民服务的，因此，对他们的缺点，应本着团结互助的精神，帮助领导人员克服，用粗暴的办法不是正确的态度。（二）吵、闹、旷工，是工人在旧社会向阶级敌人进行斗争的方法，今天用来对待自己企业中的领导工作人员是不妥当的。（三）吵、闹对谁有利呢？大多数人认为打闹，会给生产、建设带来损失，对国家不利，也就是对工人阶级的事业不利，对自己也是不利的，而敌人却喜欢这种做法。有人说：“我们为什么做敌人喜欢的事呢！”
    事实生动地教育了干部，使他们知道脱离群众的危险性，克服官僚主义的迫切意义；同时，也教育了群众如何正确对待领导工作人员的缺点了。个人利益和集体利益怎样结合呢？
    第二，领导工作人员既然不关心群众，自然不可能去教育群众正确处理个人利益同整体利益之间的关系，而实际上有许多问题恰恰发生在这里。讨论时曾有人说“大吵大闹是对集体利益的破坏”，于是便有人发表文章，认为个人利益是同集体利益无法结合的。二十三岁的建筑工人张文忠，说自己“盖的高楼大厦，住的是土房草舍”，认为把青春消失在荒凉的地方，白替别人忙，于是得出结论：“国家前途光芒万丈，个人前途暗淡无光”。一位名叫朱致笠的中学教师，看到张文忠的文章有感，认为自己等级提的慢、工资收入增加的不多，便说：“教师工作像蜡烛或火柴一样，照亮了别人，毁灭了自己！”这时，甘肃日报编辑部提请大家注意对这个问题的讨论。
    在讨论的过程中，虽没有长篇大论，也没有连篇累牍引经据典，却把三个问题讨论得清清楚楚。
    以革命先烈做自己的榜样
    （一）许多人认为在我国的任何一种劳动，不仅是为了个人，更光荣的是为了全体人民的幸福。汽车修理厂铸工褚怀君说：“革命的先烈们，难道都是为个人的幸福才视死如归、光荣牺牲的！如果人人都像张文忠同志那样，能有新中国吗！”地质人员李永宁以“把英雄当榜样，个人前途亮又亮”为题，说自己刚到野外时害怕困难，哭过，想回家。后来，自己想到了一个青年团员的责任，想到了英雄黄继光、董存瑞，安静了，热情工作了。他说：“只要勇于为国家利益而奋斗，是最大的光荣。”一个名叫黎波的反驳了朱致笠的观点以后，说：“只要一个人追求的不是个人的得失，而是追求一种真正的人生目的——为广大人民服务，就会把‘能照亮别人’当作最大的安慰，也是照亮了自己。”
    大河小河紧相连　大河有水小河满
    （二）大家讨论了个人利益同整体利益的正确关系。有人以“大河没水小河干，大河有水小河满”的道理，说明不维护国家利益，个人利益就会失去保障。同时，有许多篇文章提到这几年生产发展，人民生活得到改善的事例，说社会主义建设已经把两者紧密结合在一起了，不能为目前利益牺牲长远的利益。
    回忆旧苦难　认识新幸福
    （三）目前福利是多是少。很多老工人写了文章，一字一泪叙说旧社会工人遭受的苦难，喜悦地说明目前工人享受到的福利，是过去做梦都想不到的。有人指出，目前有的福利办的不好是事实，总不能说是太少，如果还对目前的待遇、福利不满，真是“身在福中不知福了！”
    这说明：广大群众经过讨论是能够知道自己应有怎样的人生观，应当怎样看待个人利益同整体利益的关系。
    第三，讨论的时候，同样反映出过去企业、机关中对群众进行艰苦奋斗的教育很不够。某些人所以一味追求生活享受，总想在福利方面向最高的标准看齐，是因为不懂得革命成功了为什么还要艰苦奋斗，不知道用怎样一种方法去提高生活水平了。但是，通过公开的讨论，大家明确了这两个问题。
    多数人的意见认为，在谈改善生活的时候，必须想到目前国家是有困难的。白玉才在“要体贴国家的困难”的文章中说明：国家正进行社会主义建设，因为过去底子薄，一定会有困难，而这些困难不是一下子可以克服的，要有一个过程，大家不应该提出过多的要求，更不应该一提出马上就要办到。潘德培劝大家“正确认识当前经济生活中的困难”。他说：“要是大家不管国家，只顾个人利益，不事生产，光讲究生活，把建设资金全用到改善生活上，社会主义就不可能建成，个人的生活也不可能得到彻底的改善。”在另一些人的文章中，都号召大家认清困难，忍受生活上的某些不便，集中力量建设社会主义。
    那末，用什么方法改善和提高物质文化生活水平呢！钳工刘继安认为“不吃苦中苦，难享福中福”，不要“总是钞票、钞票的，只有努力工作，才能改善生活。”皮革厂索桂荣说：“要吃水，得自己掏井”。他说：“有些条件好的地方，都是老前辈受苦换来的。要想吃水不能等别人掏井，不管多么苦，要自己动手掏。想过社会主义生活，不克服困难，不提高生产是不行的。”董伯进说：“在怎样的基础上改善生活呢？只有不断提高技术、业务水平，保证经常突破定额，超额完成生产计划，这才是改善生活的有效方法。”
    辨明是非加强团结
    现在，甘肃日报继续在报上发表“艰苦朴素、勤俭建国”的文章。这个讨论还将涉及到集中同民主的关系、纪律同自由的关系，以便纠正某些机关、企业中不正确地使用集中的权利而忽视民主生活和群众中的极端民主化的倾向，强调纪律而限制群众的某些自由的现象和群众中不遵守纪律的现象。这个讨论是异常热烈的。其所以这样热烈，是因为中共甘肃省委大力领导了这个讨论，曾指示各级党的组织动员群众参加讨论。另一个因素是这次所讨论的正是大家最关心的问题，而且是一种自由讨论，正面的、反面的意见都可以发表，心平气和地讲道理，没有讽刺、漫骂，给大家造成了说心里话的气氛。据甘肃日报编辑部负责同志说，这个讨论，还会继续一个时期，还会吸引更多的人来参加。像这样规模较大、时间较长的讨论，无疑是甘肃省思想建设中的一件大事。大家都知道，目前在我国人民内部的矛盾已是主要的矛盾，正确地处理这些矛盾，会推动社会主义建设事业向前发展，否则会给社会主义建设事业带来危害。处理人民内部矛盾的正确方法，是从团结的愿望出发，从爱护同志出发，开展批评与自我批评，克服缺点，改进工作。甘肃日报这次开展的讨论，是符合这个原则的。所以，虽然在讨论过程中，两种不同的意见争论时很尖锐，却没有影响到团结，而且起到了很大的教育作用。因此，这种公开讨论的方法，是值得提倡的。
    但是，我觉得这次讨论有个美中不足的地方，就是各机关、企业、学校中的领导工作人员很少发表意见，缺少这些领导人员公开地检查自己的缺点，表示自己改正缺点的决心的文章。我想，甘肃日报编辑部在组织今后的讨论时，如能组织企业、机关、学校的领导工作人员，检查官僚主义作风，批判脱离群众的错误，提出加强同群众的联系、加强政治思想教育的方法，会使“艰苦朴素、勤俭建国”的讨论收到更大的效果。
