Singapore's Struggle for Self-Governance

On April 11th, representatives from the United Kingdom and Singapore signed a report regarding negotiations on Singapore's implementation of internal self-governance.

After World War II, the movement of the people of Singapore against British colonial rule and demanding national independence experienced tremendous development. In order to alleviate the anti-colonialist struggle of the Singaporean people, the British were forced to promulgate a "New Constitution" in 1954 and held elections for the Legislative Assembly in Singapore in April 1955. Based on the election results, an "elected government" was established. However, this deceptive method of the British colonialists could not satisfy the Singaporean people's desire for independence. Various ruling parties in Singapore also openly expressed dissatisfaction with their positions without power and announced that they would achieve self-governance within four years.

After the Asian-African Conference, the Singaporean people's movement for independence surged even higher. The Singapore government changed its original demand to achieve self-governance within four years to achieving it within two years.

Starting from April 23, 1956, a delegation of representatives from various parties in the Singapore Legislative Assembly, led by then-Chief Minister of Singapore, Marshall, began negotiations in London with the British Colonial Secretary, Lennox-Boyd, on the issue of Singapore's future political status. The negotiations were deadlocked from the beginning on the issue of control over internal security after Singapore's independence.

The various demands put forward by the Singapore side were: Singapore should achieve self-governance within the Commonwealth by April 1957; all members of parliament should be elected by popular vote; all government ministers should be local; the British Governor's veto power should be abolished; Singapore should control internal security; and a citizenship system should be established. However, the Singapore side indicated that it was still willing to allow Britain to continue to control Singapore's external defense and foreign affairs, while only retaining the right to foreign trade. In the negotiations, although Britain made some concessions, such as: agreeing to change "Singapore Colony" to "State of Singapore"; changing the Governor to High Commissioner; allowing Singapore to have a fully elected Legislative Assembly and Council of Ministers; having the Chief Minister serve as Chairman of the Council of Ministers; and allowing Singapore to establish a citizenship system, etc., but on key issues, Britain insisted on maintaining control over Singapore's internal security, so as to continue to maintain its rule over Singapore in practice.

In the negotiations, in addition to the control of usual internal security, the Singapore side made many concessions to Britain: promising Britain the use of Singapore's military bases; agreeing to transfer all control to Britain when the situation became uncontrollable; and agreeing that Britain had the right to dissolve the Singapore Parliament and suspend the implementation of the Constitution. Even so, Britain still insisted on its stubborn position, which led to the interruption of negotiations on May 15, 1956.

After the failure of the negotiations, Marshall resigned as Chief Minister of Singapore and was succeeded by Lim Yew Hock. Lim Yew Hock stated that the primary task of his government was to resume negotiations with Britain on Singapore's internal self-governance. This negotiation has resumed on March 11th. Due to the strong demand for self-governance from all levels of the Singaporean people, and under the pressure of the rising anti-colonialism movement of the people of Asian and African countries, Britain had to make concessions on the issue of internal security and the organization of the "Defense and Security Council," which had caused the previous negotiations to break down. Britain agreed that Singapore would implement internal self-governance within the Commonwealth, abandoned its demand to occupy a majority in the Defense and Security Council, and accepted a Malayan to serve as the British Queen's representative in Singapore. However, Britain enjoyed absolute rights in Singapore's foreign affairs and defense. The agreement was reached on March 29th. (Huan)

    新加坡争取自治的经过
    4月11日，英国和新加坡双方代表签署了关于新加坡实行内部自治谈判的报告。
    第二次世界大战以后，新加坡人民反对英国殖民统治、要求民族独立的运动有了巨大的发展。为了缓和新加坡人民的反殖民主义斗争，英国不得不在1954年颁布“新宪制”，并在1955年4月在新加坡举行立法议会选举。根据选举结果成立了“民选政府”。但是英国殖民者这种欺骗性的手法并不能使新加坡人民要求独立的愿望得到满足，新加坡各执政党对它们的有职无权也公开表示不满，并宣布要在四年内实现自治。
    亚非会议以后，新加坡人民要求独立的运动更加高涨。新加坡政府将原来在四年内实现自治的要求改为要在两年内实现。
    1956年4月23日起，由当时的新加坡首席部长马歇尔率领的新加坡立法议会各地党派代表团，在伦敦同英国殖民地大臣伦诺克斯—波伊德开始就新加坡的未来政治地位问题举行谈判。谈判一开始就在对新加坡独立后的内部安全的控制权问题上陷于僵局。
    新加坡方面提出的各项要求是：新加坡在1957年4月以前实现在英联邦范围内的自治；议员全部民选；政府部长全由当地人担任；撤销英国总督的否决权；由新加坡控制内部治安；建立公民权制度。但是，新加坡方面表示仍愿让英国继续掌握新加坡的对外防御和外交事务的控制权，而只保留对外贸易权。在谈判中，英国虽然作了一些让步，如：答应将“新加坡殖民地”改名为“新加坡国”；总督改称高级专员；让新加坡有完全民选的立法议会和部长会议；由首席部长担任部长会议主席；并允许新加坡设立公民权制度等等，但是在关键问题上，英国却坚持要掌握新加坡内部治安的控制权，以便在实际上继续保持它对新加坡的统治。
    在谈判中，新加坡方面除了平时的内部治安控制权而外，向英国作了许多让步：答应英国使用新加坡军事基地；同意在局势无法控制时把全部控制权移交给英国；同意英国有权解散新加坡议会和停止宪法的施行。虽然如此，英国还是坚持它的顽固立场，因而使谈判在1956年5月15日中断。
    谈判失败后，马歇尔辞去新加坡首席部长职务，由林有福继任。林有福表示他的政府的首要任务就是要同英国恢复新加坡内部自治的谈判。这个谈判已在3月11日起重新举行。由于新加坡各阶层人民强烈要求自治，和在亚非各国人民反对殖民主义运动的日益高涨的压力下，英国不得不在造成上次谈判破裂的内部安全问题和组织“防御和安全委员会”问题上作了让步。英国同意新加坡在英联邦内实行内部自治，放弃要在防御和安全委员会中占多数的要求，接受由马来亚人担任英国女王在新加坡的代表。但是在新加坡的外交和防御方面，英国享有绝对权利。谈判是在3月29日达成了协议的。　（焕）
