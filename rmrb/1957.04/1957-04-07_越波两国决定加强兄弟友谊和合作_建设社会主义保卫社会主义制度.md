Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 7th. The government delegations of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the People's Republic of Poland signed a joint statement in Hanoi on the 6th.

The joint statement was signed by Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Van Dong and Polish Chairman of the Council of Ministers Józef Cyrankiewicz. The joint statement said that after discussions, the two delegations believed that both the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the People's Republic of Poland are determined to thoroughly build socialism, oppose all kinds of deviations, and defend this system against sabotage by hostile forces. The two countries will continuously strive to improve the living standards of the broad masses of people from all walks of life.

The two delegations believe that continuing to build socialism on the solid foundation of Marxism-Leninism is a guarantee for the continuous progress and development of the two countries and for crushing the conspiracies of forces opposing socialism. On this issue, it is necessary to pay attention to the specific conditions of each country and to fight against revisionism and dogmatism.

Loyalty to Marxism-Leninism is a major factor in uniting all socialist countries. The common ideals of socialism closely unite the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the People's Republic of Poland, and other socialist countries. The unity among socialist countries based on the principles of proletarian internationalism, equality, mutual respect for sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs promotes the rapid advancement of these countries in the cause of socialist construction, guarantees the independence of these countries, and prevents the conspiracies of hostile forces. This is also the main foundation for the cause of fighting for peace.

The two delegations are satisfied to see that, based on the above principles, the relations between socialist countries have been greatly strengthened in the past period.

The two delegations announced that the governments of the two countries will continue to support the Hungarian people and the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government with close brotherly friendship, support plans to improve the political and economic life in Hungary, and support Hungary's struggle to defend and build socialism.

The two delegations believe that, facing the conspiracies of aggressive forces threatening peace, especially their recent intensified activities in the Middle East, the various efforts made by socialist countries and other peace-loving countries around the world to safeguard peace have created a broad basis for cooperation between these countries, despite the fact that these countries follow different systems and have their own views on the path of their development.

The two delegations announced that the two governments support the cause of the Egyptian people in defending their territorial integrity and sovereignty.

The two delegations believe that the North Atlantic, Southeast Asia, and Baghdad pacts, as well as conspiracies aimed at expanding these blocs, are manifestations of a policy of preparing for war, which will further exacerbate international tensions. These blocs should be abolished and replaced by a collective security system that truly defends world peace and opposes new wars.

The two delegations believe that concrete measures must be taken on the issue of disarmament. In this regard, persevering efforts must be made. First and foremost, all kinds of atomic weapons must be abolished.

The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam fully shares the concerns of the Polish people about the intensified rearmament of West Germany. The two delegations believe that the cooperation between socialist countries and Asian and African countries based on the principles of peaceful coexistence advocated by China and India is an extremely important factor in maintaining peace.

During the talks, the two delegations exchanged views on the situation in Indochina. The two sides expressed great dissatisfaction with the difficulties encountered in the implementation of the Geneva Accords. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the People's Republic of Poland demand that all parties concerned respect the Geneva Accords. The two sides hope that the above-mentioned difficulties will be overcome and that Vietnam will be unified. The two sides also firmly believe that the International Commission will continue to carry out its tasks on the basis of the Geneva Accords and for the benefit of peace in Southeast Asia and the world. The two delegations firmly believe that the visit of the delegation of the Government of the People's Republic of Poland to the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the close and frank talks between the two delegations will further strengthen the friendship between the two countries and consolidate their brotherly cooperation in the political, economic, cultural and other fields, which is beneficial to both countries and to world peace.

    对马克思列宁主义的忠诚，是团结各社会主义国家的一个主要因素。社会主义的共同理想，把苏联、中华人民共和国、越南民主共和国、波兰人民共和国和其他社会主义国家紧密地团结在一起。社会主义各国之间在无产阶级国际主义原则的基础上以及平等、互相尊重主权、互不干涉内政等原则上的一致，推动这些国家在社会主义建设事业中迅速前进，保证这些国家的独立，防止敌对势力的阴谋活动，这也是和平斗争事业的主要基础。

    双方代表团宣布，两国政府支持埃及人民保卫领土完整和自己主权的事业。
    双方代表团认为，北大西洋、东南亚和巴格达等集团以及目的在扩大这些集团的阴谋，都是备战政策的表现，它将促使国际局势更加紧张。这些集团应当取消，并以真正保卫世界和平、反对新的战争的集体安全体系来代替。
    双方代表团认为，必须就裁减军备问题采取具体的措施。在这方面，必须作出坚忍的努力。首先必须废除各种原子武器。
    越南民主共和国政府充分分担波兰人民对加紧重新武装西德问题所感到的忧虑。双方代表团认为，社会主义各国和亚非各国之间的建立在由中国和印度所提倡的和平共处原则基础上的合作，是维护和平的一个极为重要的因素。
    在会谈中，双方代表团就印度支那局势交换了意见。双方非常不满地看到日内瓦协定的履行遭到困难。越南民主共和国和波兰人民共和国要求一切有关方面都尊重日内瓦协定。双方希望上述困难将得到克服，越南将得到统一。双方并且坚信国际委员会将在日内瓦协定的基础上和为了东南亚和世界和平的利益继续执行自己的任务。双方代表团坚信，波兰人民共和国政府代表团对越南民主共和国的访问以及两国代表团的亲密的坦率的会谈，将进一步加强两国的友谊和巩固两国在政治、经济、文化等方面的有利于两国和有利于世界和平的兄弟般的合作。
