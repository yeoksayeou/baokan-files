Beautiful Hopes Turned into Sighs of Worry
——Some Aspects of the French Economy in 1956——
Yuan Xianlu

In 1954 and 1955, the French economy saw significant improvements: industrial production rose at a relatively high rate, prices were basically stable, the fiscal deficit decreased somewhat, and the foreign trade deficit declined year by year... Therefore, at the beginning of 1956, the French bourgeois press used optimistic tones to predict the economic development trend for the year, employing many exciting words such as "rapid expansion" and "overall leap forward."

But now, when they review the French economic situation in 1956, the tone is completely different. For example, an article published by "Combat" at the beginning of this year lamented the difficulties encountered by the French economy in 1956 and expressed infinite concern that "difficulties will evolve into a crisis."

Why did beautiful hopes turn into sighs of worry in just one year? Let's take a look at some specific aspects of the French economy in 1956.

Problems in Industrial Development

If we only look at the overall industrial production index, the situation in 1956 does not seem bad: industrial production rose by nearly 9% within a year. This growth rate was second only to West Germany in Western Europe and far exceeded other countries. However, growth rate alone cannot explain the whole problem. Behind this figure lies a series of factors hindering further development of industrial production.

One of the main driving forces behind the increase in industrial production in 1956 was the rapid expansion of military production. In 1955, France's military orders amounted to 600 billion francs, while in 1956, payments to the arms industry increased to 1 trillion francs. Currently, military orders account for more than 20% of industrial finished products, and at least 500,000 workers are directly engaged in the production of military materials. This situation has in turn had adverse effects on the economy. The expansion of military production has increased the demand for imported raw materials, while weakening the capacity for exports, which are increasingly important to the French economy. In 1956, many industrial sectors felt that the supply of raw materials was insufficient, one of the reasons being that there were not enough exports to exchange for the needed imported raw materials.

Increased investment is another important reason for the rise in industrial production. Investment in 1956 increased by 8% compared to 1955. According to the British magazine "The Economist," French industrialists' enthusiasm for investment was "unprecedented in thirty years." However, generally speaking, the proportion of industrial investment in France's gross national product has always been low. Insufficient capital has always been a problem in the postwar development of French industry. Investment in 1956 only accounted for about 14% of the country's total output value, while other member countries of the European Economic Cooperation Organization generally accounted for 18% to 20%. The degree of renewal of France's fixed capital is far behind that of Britain and West Germany. There are even fewer newly built and expanded enterprises. The growth of industrial production in recent years has mainly relied on making fuller use of the production capacity of existing enterprises. Regarding this point, the Finance Committee of the French National Assembly issued a warning in a report made at the end of 1956, stating that the development of many industrial sectors in France "appears to have reached the peak of the possible range."

The capital was originally insufficient, and the distribution was extremely uneven. This increased the imbalance in production development. Automobile production reached about three times that of 1938 in 1955, and increased by another 17% in 1956, but now there are difficulties in sales. At the same time, most consumer goods industrial sectors received very little investment, and the production equipment of the textile industry has not yet recovered to pre-war levels. Due to outdated technology, coal production in 1955 only increased by 21% compared to 1938, and even decreased by 0.4% in 1956. The production of the metallurgical industry was affected by the insufficient supply of coke and coking coal.

Deterioration of Foreign Trade

In 1956, the foreign trade situation deteriorated significantly. The total value of imports increased by 18% compared to 1955, the total value of exports decreased by 7% compared to 1955, and the trade balance shifted from a surplus of more than 60 billion francs in 1955 to a deficit of more than 350 billion francs.

One of the reasons for the deterioration of the foreign trade situation was that agricultural production suffered relatively serious natural disasters. In the frost of February 1956, about half of the wheat, barley, and oats were frozen to death, and vegetables and fruit trees also suffered huge losses. As a result, exports of agricultural products decreased, and imports increased.

However, the main reason is that military expansion and inflation weakened the export capacity of industrial products, while the need for imported materials increased, and some materials that could have been self-sufficient also began to rely on imports. In 1956, the import of raw materials increased by more than one-third, the import volume of coal doubled, the net export of steel decreased, and the absolute number of exports of finished products did not increase much. Although the French government has adopted protective policies in foreign trade in recent years, with preferential treatment for export commodities in the form of subsidies and tax reductions, and high tariffs and quantity restrictions on imported commodities; the foreign trade situation in 1956 proves that this type of artificial method cannot solve the fundamental problem.

France has always had a huge surplus in trade with the Franc zone, which is helpful in offsetting the deficit in trade with foreign countries. In 1956, due to the infiltration of American and West German goods, the situation became increasingly unfavorable.

France is particularly disadvantaged in trade with the United States and West Germany. American and West German goods are increasingly filling the French domestic market. Compared with 1955, French imports of American goods increased by 48%, and the trade deficit with the United States increased from more than 87 billion francs to nearly 160 billion francs. Comparing the first three quarters of 1956 with those of 1955, imports from West Germany increased by 31%, and the original surplus has turned into a deficit.

The huge deficit in foreign trade has made France's position in international payments increasingly weak. In the European Payments Union, France originally had a surplus of 1.2 billion francs in November 1955, but by November 1956 it owed more than 32 billion francs. The amount of France's gold and foreign exchange reserves also declined sharply. At the end of 1955, France held nearly 700 billion francs in foreign exchange reserves, but at the end of 1956, only 100 billion francs remained; of which more than 90 billion francs were drawn from the International Monetary Fund in October 1956. After that, France's fund in the International Monetary Fund was only more than 90 billion francs.

The Crisis of National Finance

France's financial situation is even worse than its foreign trade situation. The fiscal deficit in 1956 was alarming, officially estimated at 1.2 trillion, but actually likely to reach 1.5 trillion, which is almost double that of 1955.

The heavy burden of military spending is the main reason for the fiscal deficit. The military expenditure in Algeria was initially set at 200 billion francs in early 1956, but the actual expenditure was 485 billion francs. Added to other military expenditures, the total direct military expenditure amounted to more than 1.3 trillion francs (1 trillion francs in 1955), accounting for more than one-third of the total national budget expenditure (29% in 1955).

How to make up for such a huge fiscal deficit? The so-called "US aid" revenue is an indispensable item in the French government's budget; but this can only make up for a small part, and it has been decreasing year by year in the past two years. Therefore, the main need is to focus on domestic solutions. In 1956, civil expenditures in the national budget were "saved" several times. Many arbitrary taxes and levies have been increased. The number of public debt issuance increased from more than 4.7 trillion francs at the end of 1955 to nearly 5.3 trillion francs at the end of 1956. The amount of paper money issued increased from 2.54 trillion francs at the end of 1955 to 2.982 trillion francs in early October 1956, and in mid-December a new batch of banknotes with a face value of 10,000 francs appeared on the market.

Among the bad consequences caused by these measures, the most threatening to the economy is inflation. After investigating the French economic situation in the eighteen months up to the end of June 1956, the European Economic Cooperation Organization warned the French government: it must control inflation, otherwise the economy will face more serious imbalances. However, after this, the trend of inflation in France did not improve, but worsened.

According to official statistics, France's wholesale price index has risen by 4.4% in the past year, while the cost of living index (Paris area) has only risen by 1.9%. The prices of some items most necessary for people's lives have risen particularly sharply. Taking food as an example, from the autumn of 1955 to the autumn of 1956, beef rose by 25%, veal rose by 15%, potatoes rose by 13%, butter, eggs and fish rose by 10%, and various vegetables and fruits rose by as much as 55%. "France Soir" wrote in the autumn of 1956: "A frugal lunch for a family of four now costs 26% to 30% more than it did a year ago."

Due to continuous inflation, the franc has now fallen to its lowest price in the world's free market in three years. If compared with the US dollar (at the official exchange rate of 350 francs per US dollar), one US dollar could be exchanged for 387 francs at the end of 1955, and 405 francs at the end of 1956; here, the fact that the US dollar itself has depreciated should also be taken into account.

A More Gloomy Prospect

The result of the French government's launch of a bankrupt invasion of Egypt together with Britain has made the prospects for the already troubled French economy even gloomier.

The invasion of Egypt brought about an oil shortage. One-third of the power of French industry needs to rely on oil. Since the oil supply situation is hopeless to improve in the first half of 1957, it is estimated that the entire industrial production will decline by about 6%. The price of oil purchased from the United States is 15% to 20% more expensive than that of oil from the Middle East, and it also needs to take out the US dollars that France is already short of, making the international payment situation even more strained. Some important industrial raw materials from the Middle East and Asia need to be transported by detour and pay 60% or even more freight, which will further increase the cost of industrial products. The military expenditure for attacking Egypt is 50 billion francs, and the state will collect 400 billion francs less in tax revenue in fuel sales, automobile sales, transportation, and other economic sectors indirectly affected by the oil shortage, which will make the fiscal revenue and expenditure gap even larger.... All of these have already begun to be felt at the end of 1956, and their main impact will gradually become apparent in 1957.

The national budget for 1957 is an ominous sign. This is the largest budget in French history: expenditures amount to 4.5 trillion francs, an increase of 350 billion francs compared to 1956; military expenditures amount to 1 trillion francs, and the war expenses in Algeria have to be calculated separately; the deficit is expected to be nearly 1 trillion francs. However, the actual situation will be even worse than reflected in this budget. The economic commentator of "Combat" pointed out: "Military expenditure will be greater than the specified figure, and income will be less than hoped for"; most of the budget items were already "outdated" before being approved.

Because of this, French Finance Minister Ramadier has issued several warnings in these months of 1957, and has put forward many "emergency measures," including "major cuts" in budget expenditures and continued increases in taxes and issuance of public debt; refusing workers' demands for wage increases and requiring people to agree to some "sacrifices"; continuing to implement protective measures in foreign trade, further encouraging exports and restricting imports; borrowing from international organizations to prevent the franc from devaluing, and so on.

The effect of these "emergency measures" is highly questionable. The real root cause of the current French economy lies in the French government's policy of following the United States on the one hand, and refusing to give up colonial rule on the other, resulting in economic militarization, disrupting the normal operation of the national economy, and the country's resources, manpower and funds cannot be fully used for the cause of developing a peaceful economy; at the same time, it has bound France itself, and it does not expand favorable economic cooperative relations with socialist countries. The development of the French economy in recent years shows a clear clue: the Indochina War once brought the economy to the brink of collapse, the ceasefire in Indochina improved the economic situation, the expansion of the Algerian War deteriorated the economy again, and the invasion of Egypt further deepened the crisis. At present, the French government has no intention of changing its colonial suppression policy, and has repeatedly reaffirmed its loyalty to the Franco-American "alliance." Under these circumstances, it is impossible to fundamentally improve the financial and economic situation by relying on some "stopgap" measures. Therefore, even Ramadier himself felt no confidence. On March 19, he said in the National Assembly: "We are encountering a crisis, and this crisis will be a long-term one. In four or five years, the situation will still be difficult."

    美好的希望变成了忧虑的叹息
    ——1956年法国经济的一些情况——
    袁先禄
    在1954和1955两年中，法国经济状况有了很大的好转：工业生产以较高的速度上升，物价基本上是稳定的，财政赤字有所减少，对外贸易逆差的数字逐年下降……。所以，当1956年刚开始的时候，法国的资产阶级报刊都用乐观的声调预测这一年内的经济发展趋势，运用了不少像“迅速扩展”、“全面跃进”这一类激动人心的字眼。
    但是现在，在它们回顾1956年法国经济状况的时候，声调完全不同了。例如，“战斗报”在今年年初发表的一篇文章就为法国经济在1956年碰到的困难而叹息，并且为“困难将演变成危机”而感到无限担忧。
    为什么美好的希望在一年之中就变成忧虑的叹息了呢？让我们看一下1956年法国经济的一些具体情况吧。
    工业发展中的问题
    如果单从工业生产总指数来看，1956年情况似乎不坏：工业生产在一年内上升了将近9％。这种增长速度，在西欧仅次于西德而大大超过其它国家。然而，光是增长速度并不能说明问题的全部。在这个数字后面，隐藏着一连串阻碍工业生产进一步发展的因素。
    促使1956年工业生产上升的主要动力之一是军备生产的急剧扩张。1955年法国的军事订货是六千亿法郎，而1956年内付给军火工业的款项增加为一万亿法郎。目前，军事订货相当于工业制成品的20％以上，至少有五十万工人直接从事军事物资的生产。这种情况已经反过来对经济产生了不良的影响。军备生产的扩大增加了对进口原料的需求，同时却削弱对于法国经济来说日益重要的出口的能力。1956年很多工业部门感到原料供应不足，原因之一就是没有足够的出口来换回需要的进口原料。
    投资的增加是工业生产上升的另一个重要原因。1956年的投资额比1955年增加了8％。按照英国“经济学家”杂志的说法，法国工业家的投资热情是“三十年来未曾有过的”。但是，总的说来，法国工业投资在国民总产值中所占的比额始终是不高的。资金不足一直是战后法国工业发展中存在的问题。1956年的投资额只占全国总产值的14％左右，而欧洲经济合作局的其它成员国一般都占18％到20％。法国固定资本的更新程度远远落后于英国和西德。至于新建和扩建的企业就更少。近年来工业生产的增长，主要依靠使原有企业的生产能力得到比较充分的运用。关于这一点，法国国民议会财政委员会在1956年末所作的一个报告中已经提出警告说，法国很多工业部门的发展，“看来已经达到可能范围的顶点了”。
    资金本来不足，分配又极不平衡。这就增加了生产发展的不平衡性。汽车工业的产量在1955年达到1938年的三倍左右，1956年又提高了17％，而目前已经出现销售困难的现象。同时大部分消费品工业部门得到的投资很少，纺织工业的生产设备至今还没有恢复战前的水平。由于技术陈旧，煤的产量到1955年只比1938年增长了21％，1956年还下降了0.4％。由于焦炭和炼焦煤供应不足，冶金工业的生产受到了影响。
    对外贸易的恶化
    1956年，对外贸易情况显著地恶化了。进口总值比1955年增加了18％，出口总值比1955年下降了7％，出入相抵由1955年的顺差六百多亿法郎一变而为逆差三千五百多亿法郎。
    对外贸易情况恶化的原因之一，是农业生产受到了比较严重的天灾。在1956年2月的霜冻中，小麦、大麦和燕麦都冻死了一半左右，蔬菜和果木也受到了巨大的损失。于是，农产品输出减少了，输入增加了。
    但是，主要的原因是军备扩张和通货膨胀削弱了工业品输出的能力，同时对进口物资的需要增加了，一些本来可以自足的物资也开始依赖于进口。1956年，原料的进口增加了三分之一以上，煤的进口量增加了一倍，钢铁的出口净额减少了，制成品出口的绝对数字没有什么增加。虽然法国政府近年来在对外贸易中采取了保护政策，出口商品有补贴和减税的优惠待遇，进口商品要征很高的关税和受到数量的限制；但是1956年对外贸易的情况证明，这一类人为的办法是不能解决根本问题的。
    法国对法郎区的贸易一直有巨大的顺差，对于弥补同外国的贸易中的赤字是不无小补的。在1956年，由于美国、西德商品的渗入，情况也越来越不利了。
    法国在对美国和西德的贸易中特别不利。美国和西德的商品日益充斥法国国内的市场。以1956年同1955年相比，法国输入的美国货增加了48％，对美贸易逆差从八百七十多亿法郎增加为将近一千六百亿法郎。以1956年和1955年的头三个季度来相比，从西德的输入增加了31％，原来的顺差已经变成了逆差。
    对外贸易的巨大赤字，使得法国在国际支付中地位越来越弱。在欧洲支付同盟中，法国在1955年11月原来有十二亿法郎的结余，到1956年11月却亏欠了三百二十多亿法郎。法国黄金外汇储备的数量也直线下降。1955年底法国掌握的外汇储备将近七千亿法郎，1956年底只剩下了一千亿法郎；其中有九百多亿法郎还是在1956年10月份从国际货币基金组织中抽支出来的。在这以后，法国在国际货币基金组织里的基金，就只剩下九百多亿法郎了。
    国家财政的危机
    法国的财政情况甚至比对外贸易的情况还坏。1956年的财政赤字是惊人的，据官方估计是一万二千亿，实际上可能达到一万五千亿，这比1955年几乎增加了一倍。
    沉重的军费负担，是造成财政赤字的主要原因。阿尔及利亚的军费，在1956年初规定是二千亿法郎，结果实际上花了四千八百五十亿法郎。加上其它的军事开支，直接军费总数达一万三千多亿法郎（1955年是一万亿法郎），占国家预算总支出的三分之一以上（1955年是29％）。
    怎样来弥补如此庞大的财政赤字呢？所谓“美援”收入是法国政府预算中一个不可少的项目；但是这只能弥补一小部分，而且近两年来已经逐年减少。因此，主要需要在国内打主意。在1956年，国家预算中的民用开支几次被“节约”。苛捐杂税增加了不少。公债发行数字从1955年底的四万七千多亿法郎增加为1956年底的近五万三千亿法郎。纸币发行量从1955年底的二万五千四百亿法郎增加为1956年10月初的二万九千八百二十亿法郎，而在12月中旬市上又出现了一批新样式的票面一万法郎的钞票。
    这些办法所引起的恶果中，对经济威胁最大的是通货膨胀。欧洲经济合作局在调查了截至1956年6月底为止的十八个月中法国经济情况以后，曾经警告法国政府说：必须控制通货膨胀，否则经济将面临更严重的不平衡。但是，在这以后，法国通货膨胀的趋势并没有好转，反而加恶化了。
    法国的批发物价指数，据官方统计，一年来上升了4.4％，而生活指数（巴黎地区）只上升了1.9％。价格涨得特别凶的是一些人民生活中最必需的物品。拿食品来说，从1955年秋季到1956年秋季，牛肉涨了25％，小牛肉涨了15％，土豆涨了13％，牛油、鸡蛋和鱼涨了10％，而各种蔬菜和水果竟上涨了55％。“法兰西晚报”在1956年秋季写道：“四口之家一餐俭朴的午饭，现在要比一年前多值26％到30％。”
    由于通货不断膨胀，目前法郎在世界自由市场上已经下降到三年来最低价格。如果同美元作比较（按官方汇率是一元美元换三百五十个法郎），一元美元在1955年底可以换三百八十七个法郎，到1956年底就可以换四百零五个法郎；这里还应该考虑到美元本身贬值的事实。
    更为黯淡的前景
    法国政府同英国发动破产的侵埃战争的结果，使得本已困难丛生的法国经济的前景更为黯淡了。
    侵埃战争带来了石油荒。法国工业的动力有三分之一需要依靠石油。由于在1957年上半年石油供应情况无望改善，估计整个工业生产将下降6％左右。向美国购买的石油，价格要比中东的石油贵15％到20％，而且还需要拿出法国已经短缺的美元，使得国际支付情况更为紧张。有一些来自中东和亚洲的重要工业原料，因为需要绕道运输而多付60％甚至更多的运费，这又会进一步提高工业品的成本。进攻埃及所付出的军事开支是五百亿法朗，而在燃料销售、汽车销售和运输以及其它间接受到石油荒影响的经济部门，国家将少收四千亿法郎的税收，这就要使得财政收支差额更为悬殊……。所有这些，在1956年末已经开始感到了，而其主要的影响将在1957年逐渐明显地表现出来。
    1957年的国家预算就是一个不祥的兆头。这是法国历史上最庞大的预算：支出达四万五千亿法郎，比1956年增加了三千五百亿法郎；军费开支达一万亿法郎，而在阿尔及利亚的战费还得另外计算；赤字预计是近一万亿法郎。但是，实际情况将比这个预算所反映的更为糟糕。“战斗报”的经济评论员指出：“军费将比所规定的数字更大，收入将比所希望的更少”；预算的大部分项目在批准之前就已经“失去时效”了。
    正因为如此，法国财政部长拉马第埃在1957年这几个月中已经几次发出警号，并且提出了不少“紧急措施”，其中包括“大杀大砍”地削减预算开支和继续增加税收、发行公债；拒绝工人增加工资的要求，并且要人民同意作一些“牺牲”；继续执行对外贸易中的保护措施，进一步鼓励出口和限制进口；向国际组织借款，使法郎不贬值等等。
    这些“紧急措施”的效果如何是大可怀疑的。目前法国经济的真正病根在于法国政府执行了一方面追随美国，而另一方面不肯放弃殖民统治的政策，以致经济军事化，破坏国民经济的正常运转，国家的资源、人力和资金不能充分用到发展和平经济的事业里去；同时束缚了法国自己，不同社会主义国家扩大有利的经济合作关系。近几年来法国经济的发展，可以看到一条明显的线索：印度支那战争曾经使经济濒于崩溃的边缘，印度支那的停战就使经济状况有了好转，阿尔及利亚战争的扩大又使经济恶化了，而侵埃战争更使危机进一步加深。目前法国政府既无意改变殖民镇压政策，又一再重申对法美“联盟”的忠诚，在这种情况下，靠一些“饮鸩止渴”的办法，是决不能使财政经济情况得到根本好转的。因此，连拉马第埃自己也感到没有信心，3月19日他在国民议会里就说：“我们正在遭到危机，这个危机将是长时期的。在四、五年内，情况将仍旧是困难的。”
