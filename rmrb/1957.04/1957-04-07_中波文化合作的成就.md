Achievements of Sino-Polish Cultural Cooperation
Zhang Zhixiang, Vice Minister of Culture of the People's Republic of China

	If we look back at the cultural exchanges and cooperation between China and Poland over the past few years, we will come to a satisfactory conclusion: this exchange and cooperation is developing extensively and deeply, and it plays an important role in promoting the friendship between the people of the two countries and promoting the development of their respective national cultures.
	The cultural exchanges and cooperation between China and Poland, like the cultural exchanges and cooperation between all socialist countries, are not only based on the common interests and common aspirations of the people of the two countries, but also receive full care and support from the governments of the two countries. The governments of China and Poland signed the "Sino-Polish Cultural Cooperation Agreement" in 1951, and subsequently signed the Broadcasting Cooperation Agreement, the Scientific Cooperation Protocol and the Agreement on Exchanging Students, which guaranteed extensive cooperation between the two countries in science and culture.
	In recent years, literary and art workers of China and Poland have made important contributions to enhancing mutual understanding and friendship between the people of the two countries. Mutual visits by writers, artists and various art groups are a good way to promote the understanding of each other's excellent cultural traditions and spiritual life among the vast number of people in the two countries. The performances of the Polish "Mazowsze" Song and Dance Troupe and the Polish Army Song and Dance Troupe in China are still fondly remembered by Chinese audiences. Beautiful Polish folk songs such as "Little Cuckoo" have become one of the popular songs in China. Chinese art troupes are also warmly welcomed by Polish audiences in Poland. The "Red Silk Dance" and "Tea Picking and Butterfly Catching Dance" have been included in the repertoire of Polish song and dance troupes; Chinese acrobatic troupes have visited and performed in Poland six times, and have been welcomed and appreciated by audiences every time. The creative work done by writers to enhance the friendship between the Chinese and Polish people is also very touching. The Polish writer Pshimanovsky came to China with another Polish writer for a half-year trip in 1955. He visited Yijiangshan Island, which had just been liberated in China, and wrote more than 200,000 words of reportage "Yijiangshan Island". He went to some places where the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army had experienced the Long March, and completed the first part of the Long March novel. In addition, he wrote about 400,000 words of news reports introducing the New China, which were published in newspapers and periodicals in Poland, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia. After visiting Poland, the Chinese writer Sun Junqing also collected his impressions of visiting Pshimanovsky and the heroic struggle stories about Polish sailors hijacked by the Chiang gang in Taiwan in his book "Letters from Europe". During their visits to Poland, Chinese painters Guan Shanyue and Liu Mengtian, and Polish painters Gulisevich, Kobzdei, Samoisky, Panek, and Strumivor, portrayed the industrious and kind images of the people of the two countries and the unforgettable beautiful scenery with their brushes. When their works were exhibited in Warsaw and Beijing, they aroused great interest in the art circles of the other side and received excellent evaluations.
	China and Poland also held exhibitions of exhibits sent by each other. Each exhibition has a specific theme, and the mass base it touches is very broad. For example, the seven exhibitions held by Poland in China were attended by more than one million people. Among them, the "Polish Photography Exhibition" and the "Polish Poster and Book Illustration Exhibition" were highly praised by the photography, art and publishing circles in China. In particular, the bold creation and diversification of forms in Polish posters gave the art circles in China a lot of inspiration. The exhibits sent by China were also cherished and valued by Polish audiences. The Chinese Arts and Crafts Exhibition held in Warsaw in 1954 was attended by 120,000 people. The Dunhuang mural exhibition held in Warsaw in January this year also received a good response. We are particularly honored that the exhibition was personally inaugurated by Polish Prime Minister Sirankiewicz.
	China and Poland have also adopted various methods to conduct cultural exchanges. Mutual translation of books is a regular work between the publishing industries of the two countries. In the past seven years, China has translated and published more than 70 Polish political, economic, literary, scientific and technological books, with nearly 500,000 copies printed; Poland has translated and published 50 Chinese books, with one million copies printed. Commemorating each other's cultural celebrities is also a good way to introduce each other's outstanding national culture. China has commemorated the great Polish scientist Copernicus, the founder of modern astronomy, the talented Polish patriotic poet Mickiewicz, and the great Polish physicist Madame Curie. Poland has also commemorated China's great poet Qu Yuan and the literary giant Lu Xun. Our drama troupes also pay attention to staging famous Polish dramas, such as the drama "Julie and Israel" written by the famous Polish writer and winner of the World Peace Prize, Kruczkowski, which depicts the heroic martyrdom of the American peace warriors Rosenberg and his wife, and Yolandot's comedy "Such an Era". The performances of these two dramas have become important events in China's drama life.
	Scientific cooperation plays an important role in developing each other's scientific research and helping each other's socialist economic construction. In scientific cooperation, Poland's assistance to China is greater than China's assistance to Poland. Poland sent the world-famous Polish physicist Infeld to China to give lectures. Scientists from our two countries have established deep friendships, they often correspond, exchange their research experience, and provide each other with research data. For example, after the Polish female biologist Lekoczynska visited China and returned to her country, she still maintains contact with several agricultural colleges in Beijing, Nanjing and Northeast China, exchanging plant seeds. The seeds of friendship between Chinese and Polish scientists, through direct contact, are also taking root and multiplying in each other's hearts like these plant seeds.
	China has received Poland's selfless assistance not only in science and technology. Everyone knows that China's outstanding young pianist Fu Cong won the third prize and the Mazurka best performance award at the 1955 International Chopin Piano Competition. His award is inseparable from the careful teaching and guidance of the famous Polish pianist. At the same time, everyone also knows that Poland's gliding movement is the most famous in the world. With the help of Polish gliding experts, China has established gliding schools, which is of great significance for the development of China's gliding sports.
	Mutual dispatch of students is one of the ways to learn from each other's scientific and cultural achievements. The first students sent by both sides have now returned to their own countries, dedicating themselves to the glorious cause of their motherland's economic and cultural construction and enhancing Sino-Polish friendly relations. At the same time, with the increase in the number of international students, the number of people who understand each other's languages ​​is increasing day by day, which is undoubtedly a great convenience for further communication between the two countries' cultures.
	The Chinese government delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai visited Poland in January this year, and the Polish government delegation headed by Polish Prime Minister Sirankiewicz is now also visiting China. The mutual visits of the prime ministers of the two countries mark a new development in Sino-Polish friendly relations. At this time, we look back at the Sino-Polish cultural cooperation in the past few years, we feel particularly excited, and we are full of confidence in the further development of cultural cooperation between China and Poland, because the friendly relations and cooperation between China and Poland are linked by the common thought of building socialism, and further cultural cooperation will help strengthen the fraternal friendship between China and Poland, help the socialist construction of China and Poland, and help the sacred cause of defending world peace.

    中波文化合作的成就
    中华人民共和国文化部副部长　张致祥
    假如我们回顾一下几年来中波两国的文化交流和合作的情况，会得出一个满意的结论：这种交流和合作是在广泛地日益深入地发展着，它对于促进两国人民的友谊，推动各自的民族文化的发展，起了重要的作用。
    中波两国的文化交流和合作，同一切社会主义国家之间的文化交流和合作一样，不仅是建立在两国人民的共同利益和共同愿望的基础之上，并且得到两国政府的充分关怀和支持，中波两国政府在1951年签订了“中波文化合作协定”，此后又陆续签订了广播合作协定、科学合作议定书和关于互派留学生的协定，保证了两国在科学、文化各个方面进行广泛的合作。
    几年来，中波两国的文学艺术工作者们，在增进两国人民之间的相互了解和友谊方面，作出了重要的贡献。作家、美术家和各种艺术团体的相互访问，是促进两国广大人民了解彼此的优秀文化传统和精神生活面貌的良好方式。波兰“玛佐夫舍”歌舞团、波兰军队歌舞团在我国的访问演出，至今还在我国的观众中留着美好的回忆。像“小杜鹃”这样优美的波兰民歌，已成为我国流行的歌曲之一。中国的艺术团体在波兰也受到波兰观众的热烈欢迎，“红绸舞”、“采茶扑蝶舞”曾被列入波兰的歌舞团的演出节目；中国的杂技团曾先后六次在波兰访问演出，历次受到观众的欢迎和赞赏。作家们为了增进中波人民的友谊所进行的创作劳动，也是非常动人的。波兰作家普希曼诺夫斯基，在1955年曾和另一位波兰作家来我国作了半年的旅行，他访问了我国刚解放了的一江山岛，写了二十多万字的报告文学“一江山岛”，他到了中国工农红军万里长征所经历的一些地方，完成了关于长征的长篇小说的第一部，此外他还写了介绍新中国的通讯报道共约四十万字，分别登载在波兰、苏联、捷克斯洛伐克的报刊上。中国作家孙峻青，在访问波兰后，也把他拜访普希曼诺夫斯基的印象和关于被台湾蒋帮劫持的波兰海员的英勇斗争故事的记述，收集在他所著的“欧行书简”中。中国画家关山月、刘蒙天在访问波兰期间，波兰画家古力谢维兹、柯布兹德依、萨莫依斯基、潘奈克、斯特鲁米沃在访问我国期间，都用他们的画笔，刻画了两国人民的勤劳、善良的形象和他们所难忘的幽美景物。他们的作品在华沙和北京展览时，都引起了对方美术界的极大兴趣，得到极好的评价。
    中波两国还举办了对方送来的展品的展览会。每个展览会都有特定的专题，它所接触的群众面是很广的。例如波兰在我国展出的七个展览会，观众就达一百多万人次。其中“波兰摄影展览会”、“波兰招贴画和书籍插图展览会”，受到我国摄影界、美术界、出版界的交口赞赏，特别是在波兰招贴画方面的大胆创造和形式的多样化，给予我国美术界不少的启发。我国送出的展品，也受到波兰观众的珍爱和重视。1954年在华沙展出的我国工艺美术展览会，观众就达十二万人次。今年1月在华沙举办的敦煌壁画展览，也得到良好的反应，特别使我们感到荣幸的是，这个展览会是由波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹亲自剪彩的。
    中波两国还采用了各种各样的方式来进行文化交流。互相翻译书籍，是两国出版业之间的经常工作。七年来我国翻译出版的波兰政治、经济、文学、科技书籍共七十多种，印行了近五十万册；波兰翻译出版我国的书籍有五十种，印行了一百万册。互相纪念对方的文化名人，也是介绍彼此的民族优秀文化的很好的方式。我国曾纪念过波兰伟大的科学家、近代天文学的奠基人哥白尼，波兰天才的爱国诗人密兹凯维支，波兰伟大的物理学家居里夫人。波兰也纪念过我国的伟大诗人屈原和一代文学巨人鲁迅。我们的戏剧团体还注意上演波兰的名剧，像波兰名作家、世界和平奖金获得者克鲁奇柯夫斯基所写的、描写美国和平战士罗森堡夫妇英勇就义的话剧“朱利和伊斯尔”，尤兰道特的喜剧“这样的时代”。这两个话剧的上演，都成为我国戏剧生活中的重要事件。
    科学合作对于发展彼此的科学研究工作和帮助彼此的社会主义经济建设方面，起着重大的作用。在科学合作上波兰方面给予我国的帮助，较之我国给波兰的帮助是更多的。波兰曾派出世界著名的波兰物理学家英费尔德来我国讲过学。我们两国的科学工作者已经建立了深厚的友谊，他们之间经常通信，交换自己研究的心得，互相提供研究资料。像波兰女生物学家列柯琴斯卡在访问我国回去后，至今还经常同我国的北京、南京、东北的几个农学院保持着联系，交换着植物种子。中波科学工作者的友谊种子，通过直接的联系，也正像这些植物种子一样，在彼此的心田中生根、繁殖起来。
    我国得到波兰无私的帮助的，不仅在科学技术方面，大家都知道我国的优秀青年钢琴家傅聪，曾经在1955年国际萧邦钢琴比赛会上获得第三奖和玛茹卡演奏最优奖，他的获奖是和波兰名钢琴家的悉心传授和指教分不开的。同时大家也知道，波兰的滑翔运动在国际上是最负盛名的，我国依靠了波兰滑翔专家的帮助，建立了滑翔学校，这对于开展我国的滑翔体育运动，有着重要的意义。
    互相派遣留学生是互相学习对方科学文化成就的方法之一。双方最早派出的留学生，现在已经回到自己的国家，献身于
  自己祖国的经济、文化建设工作和增进中波友好关系的光荣事业。同时随着留学生的增加，懂得对方的语文的人一天天多起来了，这对于进一步沟通两国的文化联系，无疑地是一个莫大的便利。
    我国以周恩来总理为首的政府代表团在今年1月访问了波兰，以波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹为首的波兰政府代表团现在也来到我国进行访问。两国总理的相互访问，标志着中波友好关系的新发展。在这个时候我们来回顾一下几年来的中波文化合作的情况，感到特别的兴奋，并且对于中波两国间文化合作的进一步发展，充满着信心，因为中波两国的友好关系和合作是由建设社会主义的共同思想联结起来的，而进一步的文化合作，又将有助于加强中波兄弟般的友谊，有助于中波两国的社会主义建设，有助于保卫世界和平的神圣事业。（附图片）
