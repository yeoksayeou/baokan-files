Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, April 23rd: According to a report in "The Republic" on the 22nd, Egypt has formally notified Jordan that it has allocated 2.5 million Egyptian pounds in hard currency, specifically for Jordan to use in settling accounts for imports from European countries that have trade relations with Egypt.

According to sources in Amman, Saudi Arabia has allocated 5 million pounds in hard currency for Jordan to use at its discretion.

This is an arrangement made in accordance with the terms of the Arab Solidarity Agreement. In this agreement, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Syria promised to "jointly provide Jordan with 12.5 million pounds in aid to replace the British financial subsidies to Jordan." These subsidies have ceased with the termination of the Anglo-Jordanian Treaty.

    埃沙两国拨款援助约旦
    新华社开罗23日电　据“共和国报”22日报道，埃及已经正式通知约旦，它已经拨出二百五十万埃镑的硬币，专供约旦在从那些与埃及有贸易关系的欧洲国家进口物资结算时用。
    据安曼消息说，沙特阿拉伯已经拨出了五百万英镑硬币供约旦支配。
    这是按照阿拉伯团结协定的条款所作的一项安排。在这个协定中，埃及、沙特阿拉伯和叙利亚答应“共向约旦提供一千二百五十万英镑的援助，以代替英国对约旦的财政补贴。”这种补贴已经随着英约条约的终止而停止。
