Cloth Ration Coupon Usage Instructions

Following the State Council's announcement on April 20th regarding the decision to halve the value of the second issue of cloth ration coupons this year, some consumers are unclear about how to distinguish between the first and second issues of cloth ration coupons. The following explanation is provided:

1.  Cloth ration coupons already issued in various regions, printed with the words "Valid from September 1, 1956 to August 31, 1957," are the first issue of cloth ration coupons. These cloth ration coupons will not be discounted in any way and will continue to be valid at their full face value until August 31st.

2.  The second issue of cloth ration coupons refers to cloth ration coupons printed with the words "Valid from May 1, 1957 to August 31, 1957." These cloth ration coupons will be used at half their face value starting May 1st.

3.  In regions where annual general cloth purchase certificates have been issued without phased cloth purchase certificates (such as Gansu and Henan), all cloth purchase certificates will be used at half their face value starting April 20th. (Although Henan Province's cloth purchase certificates are printed with phased wording, they are not actually used in phases.)

    布票用法说明
    4月20日国务院公布了今年第二期布票对折使用的决定以后，有些消费者对第一期布票和第二期布票怎样区别分不清楚。现在说明如下：
    1、各地已发的印有“自1956年9月1日起至1957年8月31日止”字样的布票，即为第一期布票。这种布票一律不折扣，继续十足通用，至8月31日止。
    2、第二期布票，系指印有“自1957年5月1日起至1957年8月31日止”字样的布票。这种布票自5月1日起对折使用。
    3、凡是发了全年通用购布证而没有分期购布证的地区（如甘肃、河南等），自4月20日起，全部购布证一律按票面数额对折使用（河南省购布证虽印有分期字样，但实际上没有分期使用）。
