    Between "Old Friends"
    —On the US-UK Bermuda Talks—
    Yuan Xianlu
    More than ten days have passed since the end of the Bermuda talks. During this time, American and British newspapers have reported a lot about the background of these talks. Now, a more detailed observation can be made of this meeting.
    
    Macmillan's "Capital"
    Before the talks began, Macmillan expressed his intention to talk "frankly" with Eisenhower. Macmillan understood that in dealing with this "old friend" across the ocean, he had to have some capital in order to avoid suffering losses. Therefore, in the period before the talks began, London put a lot of effort into making arrangements. When Macmillan set off for Bermuda, he finally had some things in his briefcase:
    
    The British plan to withdraw troops from Europe. Britain put forward this plan in February and managed to get the Western European Union to agree, on the eve of the Bermuda talks, to the withdrawal of 13,500 British troops from West Germany in the 1957-58 fiscal year. The Western European Union also suggested that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization conduct a comprehensive review of the size of its military. This was an important trump card in Macmillan's hand when he was in Bermuda. Because Washington was worried that Britain's example would cause a "chain reaction" in other Western European countries, which might lead to the collapse of the American North Atlantic policy.
    
    The British plan to strengthen ties with Western Europe. The "Free Trade Area" plan is under discussion, and a "grand plan" to merge existing Western European organizations into a unified parliament has also been put forward. Whether these plans can be realized is still a question; but Washington cannot but consider whether London might find another way out through "British-European union" if it is pushed too hard on Britain, thereby breaking up the "Anglo-American alliance" that is still quite necessary for the United States. So, this is another trump card for Macmillan.
    
    Demands for relaxing the embargo, developing trade with China, and expanding East-West economic exchanges, etc. On the eve of the talks, calls for this were rising in Britain. These are also things that Macmillan can bring to Washington's attention.
    
    Originally, Macmillan had also sought help from the hydrogen bomb. According to him, mastering the hydrogen bomb was necessary for Britain to "maintain its status as a great power." Washington has so far strictly kept the manufacturing technology of atomic and nuclear weapons secret from its London "friend," which has always been a matter of great displeasure for Britain. Unfortunately, when Macmillan went to Bermuda, Britain had not yet been able to manufacture a hydrogen bomb.
    
    Although Macmillan looked gloomy, in any case, he finally had some capital to talk "frankly" with Eisenhower. It was with this half-worried, half-happy mood that the British Prime Minister went to Bermuda to repair the Anglo-American "alliance."
    
    Eisenhower's Plan
    Compared with Macmillan, Eisenhower's mood was much more relaxed. What he wanted to plan was mainly how to squeeze more out of his "old friend," which first required the British Prime Minister to forget the past glorious history of the British Empire and be satisfied with the status of a submissive partner of the United States.
    
    Therefore, on the eve of the talks, the United States made a "show of strength."
    
    "The British Empire is declining and dying!" "Britain is no longer a strong country, not even a second-rate power!" "Now, Britain must rely on the United States to maintain its world status!" Many American newspapers shouted in unison to remind the London "partner."
    
    However, Washington also considered that if Macmillan could not account for his actions after the talks and the already unpopular Conservative government collapsed, it might not be most beneficial to the United States. Even in the Middle East, temporarily retaining some remaining British forces without restricting the United States' hands and letting it continue to bear the pressure of anti-colonialism from Middle Eastern countries might not be a bad strategy.
    
    Thus, Eisenhower had made up his mind before the talks began: it was fundamentally impossible to restore the equal partnership that Macmillan had hoped for in his inaugural speech and to adjust American policies and steps as London requested. Under circumstances that were in Washington's interests, the United States and Britain could "make peace," and even allow Macmillan to obtain some of the political capital he needed. Of course, this would be conditional on Britain's recognition of America's leadership - especially in the Middle East region.
    
    Such "Friendship"
    Thus, the US President and the British Prime Minister talked for three days in Bermuda. Officials from both countries announced that the talks between the two "old friends" were very "friendly." However, Western news agencies revealed that the talks were full of quarrels, bargaining, and even mutual threats.
    
    What was the result of the talks?
    
    On the Middle East issue, the United States announced its participation in the Baghdad Pact Military Committee. This means that after Britain ceded many of its territories in the Middle East to the United States, Washington allowed Britain to maintain a foothold there. At the same time, Britain expressed its "support" for United Nations resolutions on the Middle East issue. This was a clear concession made by Macmillan. As everyone knows, London has been very dissatisfied with Washington's practice of using the United Nations to go it alone in the Middle East and squeeze out British and French forces. Although the United States also agreed that the two countries should establish a permanent Middle East Planning Committee to consult on Middle East affairs, it also emphasized that the United States would maintain complete freedom of action.
    
    On the issue of "defense," the communiqué of the talks only stated that the United States agreed to provide missiles to Britain, and did not mention the issue of Britain's troop withdrawal plan. According to Western news agencies, the dispute over Britain's withdrawal of troops from West Germany was very fierce; even the publication time of the communiqué was delayed as a result. The result was a compromise. The United States acquiesced in Britain's plan; while Britain agreed to slow down the implementation of the plan and guaranteed that it had no intention of weakening Britain's military obligations on the continent under the North Atlantic Treaty.
    
    In addition, on the European issue, the United States vaguely expressed its recognition of the importance of Britain strengthening its ties with Western European countries, while Britain made assurances to the United States that the free trade area plan would not lead to a high tariff group. On the Far East issue, the differences between the two countries were not resolved either.
    
    This is the main situation of the talks.
    
    After the talks, many British newspapers described the United States' participation in the Baghdad Pact Military Committee and its agreement to supply Britain with missiles as a huge victory for Macmillan. There is no doubt that Washington paid some price for these two points. But in essence, it is debatable which side benefited from these two transactions. Because, although the missiles will be stored in Britain, the atomic warheads will still be controlled by the United States itself. Therefore, some British newspapers pointed out with dissatisfaction that this was actually handing over Britain's defense sovereignty. As for the United States' decision to participate in the Baghdad Pact Military Committee, even American newspapers do not deny that this was not made as a reward for Britain's certain actions in Bermuda. Eisenhower made a gesture in Bermuda, agreeing to participate in the Baghdad Pact Military Committee. Macmillan could boast loudly, saying that this was a support for Britain's position in the Middle East. But as some bourgeois public opinion pointed out, more importantly, the United States actually took over the leadership of the Baghdad Pact from Britain.
    
    A commentary in the American "Christian Science Monitor" on the talks is meaningful. It attributed the "achievements" of this meeting to Macmillan's "realistic attitude." The newspaper said that Macmillan "did not waste time reminiscing about the imperial honors of the past" and acknowledged that "the United States, as the big partner in the alliance, will play a leading role in the Middle East from now on." From this, it seems that Britain gained less and lost more in this meeting. Shortly after the end of the Bermuda talks, Salisbury, an influential figure in the British Conservative Party leadership group, resigned because he disagreed with the government's Cyprus policy. According to British newspapers, one of the reasons was dissatisfaction with Macmillan's excessive "compromise" with the United States in Bermuda.
    
    Of course, this does not mean that Britain has adopted a resigned attitude towards the squeeze from its American "partner." When British Foreign Secretary Lloyd spoke about the results of the Bermuda talks at the end of March, he said that Britain did "not mechanically agree on every issue or immediately give in on any matter." At present, London is making various plans to strengthen its own strength. The new five-year "defense" plan announced by the British government in its defense white paper on April 4 is a step in this direction.
    
    There are deep contradictions between the United States and Britain, the two major imperialist countries; especially in the Middle East region, this contradiction has developed very sharply. Superficial "friendship" and temporary compromises cannot conceal this contradiction. With the implementation of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" and the further expansion of the United States in various parts of the capitalist world, Britain is bound to step up its confrontation, and this contradiction will become increasingly acute. This is an important conclusion that should be drawn from the Anglo-American Bermuda talks.
    
    Birds of a Feather
    However, it cannot be said that the United States and Britain did not have any important points of agreement in the Bermuda talks. At least on two major issues, the US President and the British Prime Minister announced to the world their consistent positions. That is, they both want to insist on maintaining colonialism, and they both want to continue to pursue the "Cold War" policy.
    
    For a long time, Washington has been trying its best to hide its hideous colonialist face, cunningly displaying a double-dealing approach. While greedily plundering in the Middle East, it also disguised itself as a "good friend" of the Middle Eastern people. The "Eisenhower Doctrine" is a specimen of this hypocrisy. This colonialist shackle produced by Washington, but with the packaging of "helping the people of the Middle East maintain national independence", and is carefully decorated with dollars.
    
    In the Bermuda talks, the United States announced its participation in the Baghdad Pact Military Committee, exposing its colonialist fox tail. Although Washington still tries to make people believe that participating in the Baghdad Pact Military Committee does not mean becoming a formal member of the Baghdad Pact; but the fact is, as US Senator Humphrey said, the United States has "sneaked in through the back door" of the Baghdad Pact. The people of the Middle East see this very clearly. Jordanian Prime Minister Nabulsi also pointed out at a press conference that the US action unveiled its mask and exposed its intention to interfere in the affairs of the Middle East region. According to British "Daily Express" reporter McChord, the United States and Britain also agreed in the talks to jointly interfere in the internal affairs of Jordan and Syria. The American "Washington Post" wrote in commenting on the significance of the talks in this regard: Since Eisenhower and Dulles have "obtained leadership" on the Middle East issue, "they also have to bear the same responsibility for the safety of the British, in fact, for the safety of Western Europe, for the important interests in the canal, and for the oil in the Middle East." This is only half right. The Bermuda talks proved that Washington has assumed the main responsibility for maintaining colonialism in the Middle East, but it is definitely not for the benefit of London, Paris, or other Western European colonial groups, but for the benefit of the American oil monopoly groups.
    
    In the communiqué of the talks, the heads of the US and British governments openly advocated "atomic deterrence" and declared that "it is necessary to continue effective atomic tests." This shows their blatant contempt for the strong desire of people all over the world to eliminate the destruction of atomic war and the harm of radiation. This statement, which seeks to legitimize the atomic arms race and nuclear tests, will naturally be condemned by international public opinion. Former Indian Governor-General Rajagopalachari said: The Bermuda talks communiqué's claim on nuclear weapons testing is a "destruction or poisoning notice"; "this notice may help the participants in their competition, but it is of no benefit to the world."
    
    Although imperialism has irreconcilable contradictions with each other, it is a gang of thugs in opposing the national independence movement of the colonial and dependent countries and opposing the cause of peace. This is another important conclusion that should be drawn from the Anglo-American Bermuda talks. (Attached picture)

    在“老朋友”之间
    ——关于美英百慕大会谈——
    袁先禄
    百慕大会谈结束已经十多天了。在这段时间里，美国和英国的报刊报道了不少有关这次会谈的背景情况。现在，可以对这次会谈作一个比较详细的观察了。
    麦克米伦的“本钱”
    在会谈开始以前，麦克米伦就表示他要同艾森豪威尔“坦率地”谈一谈。麦克米伦懂得，在同大洋彼岸这个“老朋友”打交道的时候要想少吃点亏，必须要有一些本钱才行。因此，在会谈开始前的一段时期中，伦敦曾煞费苦心地作了不少安排。当麦克米伦动身到百慕大去的时候，他在皮包里总算已经装着一些东西：
    英国从欧洲撤军的计划。英国在2月份提出了这个计划，并且设法使得西欧联盟在百慕大会谈前夕同意了英国在1957—58财政年度从西德撤回一万三千五百人的军队。西欧联盟还建议北大西洋公约组织就军备规模进行全面审查。这是麦克米伦在百慕大时手里拿着的一张重要王牌。因为，华盛顿担心：英国的先例会在其它西欧国家中引起“连锁反应”，结果可能使美国的北大西洋政策垮台。
    英国同西欧加强联系的方案。“自由贸易区”计划正在讨论中，把西欧现有组织合并成一个统一议会的“宏大计划”也已经提出来了。这些计划究竟能否实现还是问题；但是华盛顿毕竟不能不考虑，如果对英国逼得太凶，伦敦是否会通过“英欧联合”的办法来另找出路，从而使得对美国说来还是颇为需要的“英美联盟”散伙。所以，这是麦克米伦的另一张王牌。
    放松禁运、发展同中国的贸易和扩大东西方经济往来等等要求。在会谈前夕，这方面的呼声在英国国内正在高涨着。这些也是麦克米伦可以提起华盛顿注意的事情。
    本来，麦克米伦还曾经向氢弹求助。按照他的说法，掌握氢弹是英国“维持大国地位”所必需的。华盛顿迄今把关于原子武器和核武器的制造技术对它的伦敦“朋友”严格保密，这一直是英国大感不快的事情。可惜的是，当麦克米伦到百慕大去的时候，英国的氢弹还没有能够制造出来。
    虽然麦克米伦满脸晦气，但是无论如何，他总算多少有了一些本钱可以同艾森豪威尔“坦率地”谈一谈了。就是怀着这种半忧半喜的心情，英国首相到百慕大去修合英美“联盟”了。
    艾森豪威尔的打算
    同麦克米伦比较起来，艾森豪威尔的心情就要泰然自若得多。他所要策划的，主要是怎样从他的“老朋友”身上榨出更多的东西，这首先是要让英国首相忘掉大英帝国过去显赫的历史，而满足于当美国顺从的合伙者这样一种地位。
    所以，在会谈前夕，美国就来了一个“下马威”。
    “大英帝国正在没落和衰亡！”“英国已经不是一个强国，甚至算不得一个次等强国了！”“现在，英国必须依靠美国才能维持自己的世界地位！”很多美国报刊这样齐声叫嚷，来提醒伦敦的“伙计”。
    不过，华盛顿也考虑到，如果麦克米伦在会谈以后回国交不了账，使得早已不得人心的保守党政府垮了台，对美国未必是最有利的。就是在中东，在不束缚美国手脚的情况下暂时保留一些残存的英国势力，让它继续承受中东国家反殖民主义的压力，也未始不是得策的。
    这样，艾森豪威尔在会谈开始以前就拿定了主意：要恢复像麦克米伦就职演说中所期望的那种平等的伙伴关系，并且按照伦敦所要求的那样来调整美国的政策和步骤，这是根本办不到的。在符合华盛顿利益的情况下，美国和英国可以“言归于好”，甚至可以让麦克米伦得到一些他所需要的政治资本。当然，这也要以英国承认美国的领导地位——特别是在中东地区的领导地位为条件。
    如此“友谊”
    就这样，美国总统和英国首相在百慕大谈了三天。两国官方人士宣布，这两个“老朋友”的会谈是十分“友好”的。但是，西方国家的通讯社却透露说，在会谈中充满着争吵、讲价钱，甚至互相威胁。
    会谈的结果怎样呢？
    在中东问题上，美国宣布参加巴格达条约军事委员会。这就是说，在英国把它在中东的很多地盘让给美国之后，华盛顿允许英国在那里保持一块立足之地。同时，英国表示“支持”联合国有关中东问题的决议。这是麦克米伦作出的一个明显让步。大家知道，对于华盛顿利用联合国在中东单干，排挤英法势力的做法，伦敦一直是很不满意的。美国虽然也同意两国设立一个常设的中东计划委员会来协商中东事务，但是同时强调了美国将保持行动的完全自由。
    在“防御”问题上，会谈公报只说美国同意提供导弹给英国，而对英国撤军计划的问题只字未提。据西方通讯社透露，在英国从西德撤军的问题上，争吵是非常激烈的；甚至连会谈公报的发表时间都因而推迟了。结果是折衷的。美国默认了英国的计划；而英国同意把执行计划的进程放慢，并且保证无意削弱英国根据北大西洋公约承担的在大陆的军事义务。
    此外，在欧洲问题上，美国空洞地表示承认英国同西欧国家加强联系的重要性，而英国却向美国提出了不使自由贸易区计划导致高关税集团的保证。在远东问题上，两国之间的分歧也没有解决。
    这就是会谈的主要情况。
    会谈后，英国不少报刊把美国参加巴格达条约军事委员会和同意供应英国导弹这两件事说成是麦克米伦巨大的胜利。华盛顿在这两点上付出了一些价钱，这是没有问题的。但是从实质上说来，这两笔交易究竟是那一方占了便宜是大可研究的。因为，导弹尽管将存放到英国，但是原子弹头却仍旧要由美国自己掌握。所以，有些英国报纸不满地指出，这实际上是交出了英国的国防主权。至于美国参加巴格达条约军事委员会的决定，连美国的报纸也不讳言，这并不是为报偿英国在百慕大的某些行动而作出的。艾森豪威尔在百慕大作了一个同意参加巴格达条约军事委员会的姿态，麦克米伦固然可以大吹大擂，把这说成是对英国在中东地位的一种支持。但是正如某些资产阶级舆论所指出的，更重要的倒是美国实际上从英国手里接收了巴格达条约中的领导地位。
    美国“基督教科学箴言报”关于会谈的一篇评论是意味深长的。它把这次会谈所取得的“成就”归功于麦克米伦的“现实态度”。这家报纸说，麦克米伦“没有把时光浪费在留恋已经过去的帝国荣誉上”和承认“美国作为联盟中的大伙伴，从今以后将在中东起主导作用”。由此看来，英国在这次会谈中，得到的少而失去的多。在百慕大会谈结束以后不久，英国保守党领导集团中的有势力人物索尔兹伯里因为不同意政府的塞浦路斯政策而辞职了。据英国报纸说，原因之一就是对麦克米伦在百慕大向美国作过多的“妥协”感到不满。
    当然，这决不意味着英国对它美国“伙伴”的排挤已经采取了甘心退让的态度。英国外交大臣劳埃德在3月末谈到百慕大会谈结果的时候就说，英国并“不是在每一个问题上都机械地表示同意或对任何事项立即让步”的。目前，伦敦正在多方筹划，想加强自己的实力。4月4日英国政府在国防白皮书中宣布的新的五年“防御”计划，是这方面的一个步骤。
    在美英这两个主要的帝国主义国家之间，存在着深刻的矛盾；特别是在中东地区，这种矛盾已经发展得非常尖锐。表面的“友谊”和暂时的妥协都掩饰不了这种矛盾。随着“艾森豪威尔主义”的推行和美国在资本主义世界各地进一步的扩张，英国势必要加紧进行对抗，这种矛盾就会益趋尖锐。这是从美英百慕大会谈应当得出的一个重要结论。
    一丘之貉
    但是，不能够说美英两国在百慕大会谈中没有任何重要的一致之点。至少在两个大问题上，美国总统和英国首相向全世界宣布了他们的一致立场。这就是，他们都要坚持维护殖民主义，都要继续奉行“冷战”政策。
    长期以来，华盛顿一直竭力隐藏起自己殖民主义的狰狞面目，狡诈地施展着两面手法。它一面贪婪地在中东进行掠夺，一面又把自己装扮成中东人民的“好朋友”。“艾森豪威尔主义”就是这种假冒伪善的一个标本。这副华盛顿出品的殖民主义的枷锁，却带着“帮助中东人民维护民族独立”的包装，并且是用美元精心装饰起来的。
    在百慕大会谈中，美国宣布参加巴格达条约军事委员会，使它的殖民主义的狐狸尾巴露出来了。尽管华盛顿还企图使人相信，参加巴格达条约军事委员会并不等于成为巴格达条约的正式成员国；但是事实正如美国参议员汉弗来所说的，美国已经“从后门偷偷进入”了巴格达条约。中东人民完全看得清这一点。约旦首相纳布西在一次记者招待会上也指出，美国的这个行动，揭开了它的假面具，暴露了它要干涉中东地区事务的意图。据英国“每日快报”记者麦科尔透露，美英两国在会谈中还商定要共同干涉约旦和叙利亚的内政。美国“华盛顿邮报”在评论会谈这方面的意义时写道：艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯对中东问题“既然得到了领导权”，“他们也得对英国人的安全，实际上是对西欧的安全，对在运河的重大利益以及对中东的石油负同样的责任了”。这话只说对了一半。百慕大会谈证明，华盛顿已经承担了在中东维护殖民主义的主要责任，但是决不是为了伦敦、巴黎或者其它西欧殖民集团的利益，而是为了美国石油垄断集团的利益。
    美英两国政府首脑在会谈公报中，又公然鼓吹“原子核威慑力量”，并且宣称“继续进行有效的原子核试验是必要的”。这就表明了他们粗暴地蔑视全世界人民要求消除原子战争的破坏和放射线的毒害的强烈愿望。这种要使原子军备竞赛和原子核试验合法化的声明，自然要受到国际公众舆论的谴责。前印度总督拉贾戈帕拉查理说：百慕大会谈公报关于核子武器试验的主张是一个“毁灭或毒化的通告”；“这种通告可能有助于参加者进行他们的竞赛，而对世界却没有裨益。”
    帝国主义尽管相互之间存在着无法调和的矛盾，但是在反对殖民地附属国人民的民族独立运动和反对和平事业方面却是一丘之貉。这是从英美百慕大会谈应当得出的另一个重要结论。（附图片）
