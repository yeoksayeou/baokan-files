Xinhua News Agency, London, April 2nd. British Prime Minister Macmillan stated in the House of Commons on April 1st that while the UK and the US reached common decisions on some issues at the Bermuda talks, their opinions were not consistent on others.

Macmillan defended British policy by saying that holding the Bermuda talks was necessary because "Anglo-American relations had seriously deteriorated in recent months." He added: "Of course, it would be absurd to imagine that solutions to all the major problems we face could be found in a few days. But we discussed many issues, and we did indeed make some decisions, which have been stated in the communiqué. I want to state that there are no secret agreements." He continued: "On some issues, we are inconsistent. But nevertheless, thanks to the talks, we understand each other better."

Macmillan spoke about the attitude towards the United Nations. He said that he explained to Eisenhower during the talks his view that "trusting the United Nations alone cannot replace foreign policy." He called on the United States and Britain to "cooperate closely" in this organization in order to "exert sufficient influence on the work of the United Nations."

When the Prime Minister spoke about the Middle East, he said that the fundamental goals of the United Kingdom and the United States in "this region are clearly consistent, even if sometimes we still have differences on how to achieve these goals."

He then pointed out the coordinated actions of Britain and the United States in jointly dealing with Middle Eastern nationalism: jointly strengthening the Baghdad Pact; on the Suez issue, adhering to the six principles, with "Britain advising British shipowners not to use the canal" and "the United States also making the same recommendation"; on the Gaza Strip issue, advocating the stationing of a United Nations Emergency Force; on the Gulf of Aqaba issue, advocating that all ships, including Israeli ships, have the right to navigate there; and considering a plan to lay a new large oil pipeline. Macmillan also boasted that "the US government is playing an active leading role in dealing with Egypt," which is of great benefit to Britain.

Speaking of the US supply of missiles to Britain, Macmillan admitted that because the United States controls the atomic warheads, the United States "retains a supervisory right in a negative sense"; but "the decision on when to launch against whom" will be made by the British.

When Macmillan spoke of the agreement reached between the two countries on the hydrogen bomb test issue, he reiterated his determination to conduct nuclear weapons tests on Christmas Island. He said that abandoning such tests would be abandoning the "entire defense strategy that is the foundation of British defense policy." When a member of parliament interjected, pointing out Japan's concerns about the Christmas Island hydrogen bomb test, Macmillan replied: "I don't think they need to feel apprehensive."

In his speech, Macmillan also denied the claim that the government's decision to release Archbishop Makarios was the result of American pressure.

In the debate in the House of Commons, opposition Labor Party leader Gaitskell called for separating the issue of nuclear weapons testing from the general issue of disarmament. He said the world was uneasy about the issue, and "we must consider the impact of (testing) on world opinion." He added, however, that the Labor Party did not advocate that Britain unilaterally stop the tests.

Gaitskell also called on the British government to continue to insist on relaxing current trade restrictions on China.

He expressed satisfaction with Macmillan's statement that Britain would also have some power to decide on the use of missiles to be provided by the United States.

Gaitskell reiterated his past proposal to establish a "neutral zone" in Europe. That is: take more action to alienate the Eastern European People's Democratic countries from the Soviet Union; support the withdrawal of foreign troops from West Germany and the Eastern European People's Democratic countries.

    麦克米伦在英国下院露骨地说
    英美共同对付中东民族主义
    承认百慕大会谈未能消除两国分歧
    据新华社伦敦2日电　英国首相麦克米伦4月1日在下院表示，在百慕大会谈中，英美两国虽然在若干问题上作出了共同的决定，但是在另一些问题上，双方意见并不是一致的。
    麦克米伦为英国的政策辩护说，举行百慕大会谈是必要的，因为“最近几个月中，英美关系曾经严重恶化”。他又说：“当然，如果设想在几天之内能够找到解决我们面临的一切重大问题的办法，这是荒谬的。但是我们讨论了许多问题，我们也的确作出了若干决定，这些决定已经在公报中说明了。我要说明，没有任何秘密协定。”他接着说：“在有些问题上，我们是不一致的。但是尽管如此，由于会谈，我们彼此更加了解了。”
    麦克米伦谈到了对联合国的态度问题。他说，他在会谈时向艾森豪威尔说明了这种看法：“只是信任联合国不能代替外交政策。”他要求美国和英国在这个组织中“密切合作”以便“对联合国的工作产生足够的影响”。
    这位首相在谈到中东问题的时候说，英美两国在“这个地区的基本目标显然是一致的，即使有时候在如何达到这些目标的问题上我们还存在着分歧”。
    他接着指出了英美两国在共同对付中东民族主义方面的协同行动：共同加强巴格达条约；在苏伊士问题上，坚持六项原则，“英国劝告英国船主不要使用运河”，“美国也提出同样劝告”；在加沙地带问题上，主张驻扎联合国紧急部队；在亚喀巴湾问题上，主张一切船只包括以色列船只在内有在那里通航的权利；考虑敷设一条新的大油管计划。麦克米伦还扬言，“在对付埃及方面，美国政府正起着一种积极的领导作用”，这对英国是大有好处的。
    在讲到美国供给英国导弹问题的时候，麦克米伦承认，由于美国控制原子弹头，美国是“保有消极意义的监督权的”；但是“决定在什么时候对谁发射”将由英国人来作出。
    麦克米伦在讲到两国就氢弹试验问题达成协议时重申了要在圣诞岛举行核武器试验的决心。他说，放弃这种试验，就是放弃作为英国“防御政策的基础的整个防御战略”。有议员插话，指出日本对于圣诞岛氢弹试验的忧虑，麦克米伦回答说：“我认为他们没有必要感到忧惧。”
    麦克米伦在他的讲话里还否认政府决定释放马卡里奥斯大主教是由于受到美国压力结果的这种说法。
    在下院进行的辩论中，反对党工党领袖盖次克尔要求把核武器试验问题跟一般的裁军问题分开。他说，全世界对这个问题都感到不安，“我们必须考虑到（试验）对全世界舆论的影响”。他又说，但是工党并不主张英国单方面来停止试验。
    盖次克尔还要求英国政府继续坚持放宽目前对中国的贸易限制。
    他对麦克米伦谈到的英国也将有一定的权力来决定使用将由美国提供的导弹这一点表示满意。
    盖次克尔重复了他过去所提出在欧洲建立“中立区”的主张。这就是：采取更多的行动使东欧人民民主国家同苏联疏远；赞成从西德和东欧人民民主国家撤出外国军队。
