    Presenting Many Specific Contradictions in Work
    During discussions, committee members from various groups also brought up many specific contradictions in their work. Committee members from the medical and health fields raised a series of contradictions in medical work, such as the unity of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, the relationship between medical personnel and patients, the fact that the development of national medical undertakings cannot keep up with the needs of the people, and the problem of mutual cooperation between hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, and medical equipment factories. They believe that these issues should be gradually resolved from the desire for unity and in accordance with the principle of handling contradictions among the people. Education committee members pointed out in their discussions that a correct attitude should be taken towards the contradiction of some primary and secondary school graduates not being able to continue their education. Some parents have incorrect attitudes toward this issue. Parents should adopt an attitude of cooperation with the state. Committee members from the higher education, science, and technology fields raised opinions on the relationship between new and old teachers and the contradiction between political study and professional research in teaching work.
