    Sanmenxia people are already saying:
      “Go to the dam site!”
    Although the dam has not yet started construction, the dam site has such magnificent scenery. Nature has put on an imposing face here. The muddy river rushes through a labyrinth of scattered rocks, no wonder the old boatmen on the Yellow River call it "a yamen."
    This dam site is indeed a spectacle. First of all, the steep cliffs and majestic flow exude a sense of grandeur of the rivers and mountains. But now, the spirit of man surpasses the rivers and mountains. Three high iron cable bridges, pressing down on Sanmen, are a moving spectacle.
    Crossing the iron cable bridge, as if treading on level ground despite the danger, we walk from the right bank to Guimen Island. Beneath the bridge is Guimen (Ghost Gate), the dangerous water currents are only for us to admire.
    Another iron cable bridge crosses Shenmen (God Gate). The main stream of the Yellow River rushes down Shenmen and directly towards the Dazhushi (砥柱石) rock. The sediment forms patterns in the swirling turbulence, like scales covering the back of a giant creature, writhing and leaping.
    From Shenmen Island, after crossing another iron cable bridge, passing through Renmen (Human Gate), we arrive at Renmen Island, on the left bank. The left bank is already a socialist construction site.
    As the river makes a ninety-degree turn here, surging and rushing out of Sanmen, the roar of the water, is far less deafening than the cacophony of electric shovels, bulldozers, and rows of wind drills on the left bank. On the left bank, like soldiers attacking a hill, workers are distributed on three work surfaces, excavating Renmen Island.
    The Sanmenxia dam site is changing day by day. Renmen Island is in the process of disappearing. Later, the entire Renmen Island will be dug away; Shenmen Island and Guimen Island will be submerged and forever buried in the waves. From Renmen Island to the left bank, there is a Niangniang River (娘娘河). Fortunately, I have come just in time to see this man-made canal. It was neatly carved out of hard diorite porphyry, an engineering feat of the Kaiyuan era of the Tang Dynasty. I am almost inclined to call it a piece of stone carving art, or rather, a lock built under the magical design ideas of the ancients. Unfortunately, those who come to the dam site later will no longer be able to admire this ancient waterway, full of historical interest, with envious eyes. The most recent task is to fill it in and build a very busy transport road on top of the Niangniang River after construction starts. The sound of wind drills keeps coming.
    At the dam site, I met a team in charge of the left bank project. This is the team of the First Branch Bureau of Dam Construction, born in Guanting, grew up on the Hun River and Dou River. Now they have come to the Yellow River.
    "The dam will be nearly eight or nine hundred meters long, more than one hundred meters high, and the dam top will be more than thirty meters wide," the chief engineer of the branch bureau told me. He had just returned from Beijing after attending the meeting to review the preliminary design of Sanmenxia. "It's like a big mountain, crossing here," he said, pointing to a flagpole at the highest point of Renmen Island. I saw a red flag that had not been raised, rolled into a roll, coiled at the bottom of the flagpole. "The dam axis passes through here," he continued.
    He told me about the dam's construction, the dam will be divided into two phases of diversion: the first phase is on the left bank, which is the project they are responsible for, to block Renmen, so that the Yellow River only flows through Guimen and Shenmen.
    The first phase of the left bank project includes building a cofferdam, from the left bank to Shenmen Island, to the Dressing Table Rock (梳妆台), and then back to the left bank, forming a circle; then, excavating the weathered rocks in the cofferdam; and finally pouring the concrete dam. It is expected that all this will take two dry seasons, two years; before the third dry season, this part of the dam can be built to a certain height.
    The second phase of the project is on the right bank. In the second phase of the project, there will be a thrilling scene of a fierce battle with the Yellow River: the so-called cutting off the flow at Shenmen means not allowing the Yellow River to flow through Shenmen. Three years later, there will be a time when the working class of New China will fight fiercely with the Yellow River. About ten days and a half months will determine the outcome. By then, this harmful river will be captured by us.
    The second phase of the project also requires building cofferdams, excavating, and pouring, while installing hydropower stations. It is expected that all this will take three dry seasons, three years.
    With the arrival of the next flood season, the Sanmenxia Water Control Project will begin to control floods and store water, and allow a portion of the hydropower station to operate and transmit electricity.
    Now, huge preparations are underway. A Yellow River bridge with four piers is being built downstream of Sanmenxia. On the surrounding hills, much higher than the eagles flying, roads and railways spiral around. In the future, trains will drive directly to the dam, under ten giant gantry cranes with bird-beak frames. When the construction is most intense, the situation is indescribable. At the highest point are a pair of cable cranes, in the middle are gantry cranes, and below are many crawling cranes. It's like an orchestra set up on a stage, with double basses, violas, and violins, as well as flutes, clarinets, bass flutes, various brass instruments, and percussion instruments, crowded but harmonious. Now, on the eve of construction, the people of Sanmenxia are all eager to get started, looking up and waiting for the command to start work, just like an orchestra tuning, trying to listen to the strings, waiting for the conductor's baton to be raised. But, no, the overture has already begun.
    When I returned to the right bank and walked downstream along the road, I saw the Dazhushi rock in the middle of the stream, and looked back at Sanmen unfolding like a folding fan, with the Dazhushi rock like the axis under the fan handle; and saw the iron cable bridge, flying over Sanmen, very majestic. At this time, I noticed that the red flag at the highest point of Renmen Island had been raised to the top of the flagpole. The red flag was fluttering in the wind, making a rustling sound.
    Suddenly, the alarm siren sounded.
    This is a terrifying sound, which is not unfamiliar to me. This strange sound suddenly brought me back to the wartime. The pedestrians on the iron cable bridge also showed a hurried expression. But many road construction workers near us did not feel alarmed at all and continued to pave the slope. And for the second time, the alarm siren sounded urgently. This sound was even more disturbing, as if hundreds of enemy planes were flying towards us, and tons of steel and flames would pour down...
    However, this time the alarm is being sounded for peaceful construction!
    Three times a day, the Sanmenxia dam site has to raise the red flag, sound the alarm, and then detonate explosives to break open the rocks. At this time, on the banks of the Niangniang River on the left bank, the electric shovels and bulldozers have retreated from their positions, the soldiers attacking the mountains have disappeared, and everyone has been concealed, leaving only those who light the fuse. In an instant, even they entered the bomb shelter. Silence. Sanmenxia is like a painting, only the river is surging. At this time, a booming sound of artillery came. In an instant, the Renmen Island was filled with smoke. Only rocks were seen flying out, huge rocks soaring into the air, and flashes of fire. In the middle of the Yellow River, pillars of water flew up, and the sound of explosions echoed in the canyon.
    When the motherland is no longer a battlefield,
    She becomes a large construction site.
    Finally, the sound of the explosion disappeared. Everything calmed down again. The all-clear siren sounded again. People returned to the ground, and electric shovels and bulldozers crawled from afar. … The sound of wind drills sounded again.

    三门峡序曲
    徐迟
    三门峡的人们已经在这样说：
      “到坝头去！”
    虽然大坝还没有动工，可是，坝头有着何等雄伟的景色。大自然在这里摆起了一副威严的面孔。浑浊的河水从一座乱石布成的迷宫中奔腾经过，难怪黄河上的老梢公要把它称为“一道衙门”。
    这坝头诚然是一幅奇景。首先是峭壁雄流，河山气概磅礴。可是如今，人的气概盖过了河山。高高三座铁索桥，压在三门上面，一幅动人的奇景。
    跨过铁索桥，履险如夷，我们从右岸走向鬼门岛去。桥下便是鬼门，凶险的水势只供我们观赏。
    又一道铁索桥，跨过神门。黄河的主流冲下神门，直向砥柱石冲去。泥沙在旋转激荡中形成花纹，像一个巨大生物的背脊上披复着鳞甲，在卷动，在跳跃。
    从神门岛又跨过一条铁索桥，经过人门，我们到了人门岛，到了左岸。左岸已经是一片社会主义建设的工地。
    当河水在这里作九十度转弯，激腾起来，冲出三门之时，水声轰响，却远不如左岸那些电铲、推土机和一排排的风钻发出来的?喀之声那样震耳欲聋。左岸，像战士在进攻一个山头似的，工人们分布在三个工作面上，开挖人门岛。
    三门峡的坝头已经一天天地在变化了。人门岛正处于消失的过程中。以后，整个人门岛都要被挖掉的；神门岛和鬼门岛要被淹掉，永远葬在波涛中。从人门岛到左岸中间，横亘着一条娘娘河。我来得总算还不晚，还能看见这条人工开凿的运河。这是在坚硬的闪长斑岩中整整齐齐地凿出来的，唐朝开元年间的一件工程，我几乎要说它是一件石刻艺术，或者说，这是在古人的神奇的设计思想下，建成的一个船闸吧。可惜，以后到坝头来的人，再不能用惊羡的目光来观看这条富有历史兴味的古代河道了。最近的任务就是把它来填没，在娘娘河的上面筑成一条开工以后会非常繁忙的运输公路，只听见风钻声不断的传来。
    我在坝头见到了担任左岸工程的一支队伍。这是坝工第一分局的队伍，诞生在官厅，长大在浑河和陡河上。现在来到了黄河。
    “大坝将近八九百公尺长，一百多公尺高，坝顶宽三十多公尺”，分局的总工程师对我说。他刚从北京参加了审核三门峡的初步设计的会议回来。“这好比一座大山，横过这里，”说着，指向人门岛最高处的一根旗杆。我看见有一面并没有升起的红旗卷成一卷，盘缠在这根旗杆的下端。“坝轴线从这里通过，”他接着说。
    他给我谈到大坝的工程，大坝将分为两期导流：第一期在左岸，正是他们担任的工程，要把人门堵住，让黄河只从鬼门、神门中流走。
    第一期的左岸工程包含筑一道围堰，从左岸围到神门岛，围到梳妆台，再围到左岸，团团围成一圈；然后，在围堰中挖去那些风化了的岩石；最后浇灌混凝土坝。预计这一切需要两个枯水期，两个年头；在第三个枯水期之前这部分的坝可以筑到一定的高度。
    第二期工程在右岸。第二期工程中，将发生一场和黄河恶战的惊险场面：所谓在神门断流就是不准黄河从神门流过。三年之后，将有那末一个时间，新中国的工人阶级要和黄河激战。大约十天半个月决定胜负，到那时，这条害河将被我们擒住。
    第二期工程也要筑围堰、开挖并浇灌，同时安装水电站，预计这一切需要三个枯水期，三个年头。
    随着来到的下一个汛期里，三门峡水利枢纽就要开始拦洪蓄水，并让水电站的一部分运转送电了。
    现在，巨大的准备工作在进行。三门峡下游在建一座四个桥墩的黄河大桥。四面的山头上，比山鹰飞翔的还要高得多，公路和铁路盘旋而来。将来，火车一直要开到大坝上，开到十台巨人似的带鸟嘴架的门式起重机下面去。在施工最紧张的时候，那情况是无法描绘的，最高处是一对缆索起重机，中间有门式起重机，下面还有许多爬行的起重机。就像一个交响乐队摆在舞台上，有低音大提琴、中音提琴和小提琴，还有笛子、单簧管、低音大笛、各种铜乐器和打乐器，拥挤然而谐和。现在，处于施工的前夜，三门峡的人全都在摩拳擦掌的，仰头盼望着开工的号令，就像乐队在调整音调，试着听听弦音，等待指挥棒举起。不过，不，序曲已经奏起了。
    当我回到右岸，沿着公路向下游走去，看到中流的一座砥柱石，回首又看到三门展开如一把折扇，砥柱石像扇柄下面的轴心；又看到铁索桥，飞架在三门之上，十分雄伟。这时，我注意到人门岛高处，那面红旗已升到了旗杆顶上。红旗迎风招展，猎猎有声。
    忽然警报汽笛拉响了。
    这是一种可怕的声音，在我并不是不熟悉的。这奇怪的声音突然把我带回到战争时期。铁索桥上的行人也显出了匆忙的神情。可是在我们附近许多修公路的工人却丝毫不觉得惊惶，继续在铺砌岸坡。而第二次，紧急警报的汽笛声拉响了。这声音更叫人心悸，好像已有成百架敌机在向我们飞来，论吨的钢铁和火焰将倾泻而下……
    然而，这一次是为和平建设而拉警报啊！
    一天三次，三门峡坝头要升起红旗，鸣响警报，然后放炮炸开岩石。这时，左岸娘娘河畔，电铲和推土机已退下阵地，攻山的战士们都不见了，所有的人都已掩蔽起来，只留下点火药线的人了。一忽儿连他们也进了避弹室。寂静。三门峡如画一样，只有河水奔腾。这时轰轰隆隆的炮声传来了。一瞬之间，人门岛上硝烟迷漫。只见岩石飞迸，巨大的石块腾空而起，火光闪闪。黄河中流，飞起了一根根水柱，而峡谷中回宕着爆炸声。
    当祖国不再是一片战场，
    她就成了一片大工地。
    最后，爆炸声消失了。一切又安静了下来。解除警报的汽笛声又鸣响了。人们又回到地面上，电铲和推土机从远处蠕动而来。……风钻声又响了。
