Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, April 27th: The socialist labor competition, first launched a month ago by some industrial enterprises in Hungary since the October events last year, is further unfolding on the eve of this year's "May Day" International Labor Day. The wave of competition is spreading to various industrial sectors such as steel, machinery manufacturing, textiles, coal mining, petroleum, and construction.

This competition, which is entirely initiated and promoted by the working masses, demonstrates a new atmosphere that has emerged in Hungary since the October events.

The characteristics of the labor competition currently underway in various regions are: each industrial enterprise can adopt various different methods to carry out the competition according to the specific situation of its own unit and targeting the most critical problems within its own unit, in order to achieve a common goal—continuously promoting the improvement of labor productivity. For example, the goal of the workers in the steel pipe factory of the Csepel Machine Manufacturing United Enterprise is to reduce product costs and increase the production value of each worker.

According to a "People's Freedom Daily" editorial on the 26th, the problem existing in the current competition is that in many places, workers have taken active action, but enterprise leaders, Party organizations, and trade unions are far behind the masses. They do not pay attention to labor competitions, nor do they pay attention to improving the workers' level of awareness. The editorial also called for attention to be paid to reducing waste and improving product quality in the competition.

    迎接“五一”劳动节
    匈牙利工人开展生产竞赛
    据新华社布达佩斯27日电　一个月以前匈牙利一些工业企业在去年十月事件以来第一次开展的社会主义劳动竞赛，在今年“五一”国际劳动节的前夕，正在进一步展开。竞赛的浪潮正在扩及钢铁、机器制造、纺织、煤矿、石油、建筑等各个工业部门。
    这种完全由工人群众自动发起和推动起来的竞赛，表明了十月事件以来在匈牙利产生的一种新气象。
    目前在各地展开的劳动竞赛的特点是：各工业企业都能根据本单位的具体情况和针对本单位内最带关键性的问题，采取各种不同的方式开展竞赛，以达到一个共同的目的——不断促进劳动生产率的提高，例如，切佩尔机器制造联合企业中的钢管厂工人竞赛的目标是：降低产品成本和提高每个工人的生产价值。
    据“人民自由报”在26日的社论中指出，在目前的竞赛中存在着这样的问题，就是在不少地方，工人们积极行动起来了，而企业领导、党组织和工会却远远落后于群众。它们不重视劳动竞赛，也不重视工人觉悟程度的提高。社论还号召在竞赛中注意减少废品和提高产品质量。
