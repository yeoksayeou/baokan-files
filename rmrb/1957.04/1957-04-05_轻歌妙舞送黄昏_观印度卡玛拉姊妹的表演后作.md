　　If there are good books that make you want to read them two or three times after reading them once, and if there are beautiful mountains and watersides that make you want to visit them two or three times after visiting them once, then those good books or scenic spots are indeed worth savoring and cherishing, which is the meaning of the ancient saying: “A good book is never tiresome to read a hundred times.” I had this feeling after watching the performance of the Indian Bharatanatyam dancers, the Kamala Sisters. I watched it once, and then again, but the aftertaste was endless, and I wanted to watch it three times, four times, or even more, if possible.
　　Those extremely superb artistic performances were so simple, yet so rich and colorful. The stage had not a single bit of background or props, and thousands of eyes were focused only on one or two dancers, following her or their every move, every footstep, every raised eyebrow, and every turn of the eye, as swift as a fleeing rabbit and as graceful as a swimming dragon, exquisitely detailed, yet infinitely varied, fearing only to miss a posture or drop a gesture. Their dance posture was so gentle and charming, yet so strong and vigorous; soft as boneless, and firm as a sharp sword. Perhaps only one sentence can describe them: "Turning refined steel into silk around the finger." Without "refinement," how can the neck and shoulders be so gently turned, and the arms and fingers so rounded and harmonious? Ms. Kamala's facial expressions are endless, one moment joyful, and in an instant, transformed into pain and sorrow, and then into anger and indignation, you simply can't keep up with her changes. Her ivory-colored fingers can express all kinds of postures. In Indian dance art, hand gesture performance has always occupied a very important position. The dancer's slender fingertips can express endless words and endless emotions. Not only that, but every part of the body, especially the eyebrows, eyes, mouth, lips, cheeks, neck, shoulders, arms, and feet, can express all kinds of words and emotions. Ms. Kamala's rapidly opening and closing fingers and eyebrows, eyes, neck, and arms have successfully and elegantly reached the peak of Indian dance skills. Seeing her performance of basic dance movements, the performance of bees seems to make the audience hear the buzzing sound, gradually flying closer, circling around fragrant flowers, and resting. The performance of a stag with diverging antlers makes us see it really running in fright, its eyes so fearful. The performance of a peacock makes us feel that it is leisurely and nobly strolling, drinking and pecking, and proudly opening its colorful tail screen.
　　The Kamala Sisters come from Madras, a major seaport in southern India. Madras is a place that preserves the purest Indian flavor and is also one of the important treasures of Indian dance art. The Kamala Sisters' Bharatanatyam and many other dances belong to the southern school. But that's not to say they're not good at other dances. Ms. Kamala's northern Kathak dance is so enchanting. With the slow music, the hands, feet, eyes, and eyebrows gradually dance. Slowly waving the hands, slowly turning the feet, the clanging and pleasant sound of the ankle bells rhythmically rings, and the hundred-pleated skirt, like a rainbow in the sky, rhythmically opens and closes, and the eyebrows and eyes seem to contain infinite melancholy. Suddenly, the dance steps change from slow to fast, the music also changes quickly and sharply, and the expression suddenly becomes tense. The hands dance, the feet dance, the posture is extremely beautiful, like a colorful butterfly flying in front of your eyes, like colorful and ever-changing rainbows shining in front of your eyes. Watching her facial expressions, they also change in an instant, closely and seamlessly combined with the dance movements, matched wonderfully and pleasingly.
　　The Kamala Sisters' every dance gives us more than two hours of supreme joy and admiration. Not a single second allows you to turn your eyes elsewhere. If you are negligent for a moment, or accidentally fail to concentrate fully, you will lose a most beautiful soft and graceful posture. The dancers dance on the stage with their whole body and mind, their whole emotions, and their whole soul, and the audience must also gather all their spirits to watch. Careless people will not fully appreciate its delicate and beautiful benefits, but even they will definitely not be indifferent, will not watch without holding their breath, and will only exhale a sigh of relief when the red curtain falls.
　　The orchestra has only four people, one playing the flute, one playing the drum, one playing the chime stones and singing, and one is the director, who sometimes also participates in the singing. Although the number of people is small, they cooperate very closely. If we could understand the lyrics, we would be even more moved, but even if we don't understand them, this light song and graceful dance is enough to make the audience spend a most meaningful and most pleasant evening.
　　India, this great nation, just like the Chinese nation, has so much power, so much complexity, and such a rich and colorful cultural and artistic heritage! It is an inexhaustible source of the world's most excellent art.

    轻歌妙舞送黄昏
    ——观印度卡玛拉姊妹的表演后作
    郑振铎
    假如有什么好书使你读了一次之后，还想再读两次三次的话，有什么风光明媚的山畔水涯，使你到过一次之后，还想再去两次三次的话，那末，那些好书或那些风景区的确是值得人们吟味和留恋的了，也就是古语所云：“好书不厌百回读”之意。我看了印度婆罗多舞舞蹈家卡玛拉姊妹的表演就有这个感觉。我看了一次，又看了一次，但余味无穷，还想再看三次，四次，以至更多次，如果有可能的话。
    那些场极高超的艺术的表演，是那末简朴，又是那末丰富多采。舞台上着不得一丁点儿背景、或道具什么的，几千只眼睛只集中在一位或两位的舞蹈者的身上，随着她或她们的一举手，一投足，一扬眉，一转眼的疾如脱兔、宛若游龙的细腻之至，却又是变化无端的动作而移转着，只恐怕疏忽了一个身段，漏掉了一个手势。她们的舞姿，是那末柔媚，却又是那末刚劲；柔若无骨，刚如利剑。也许只有一句话可以描述她们：“百炼钢化为绕指柔。”不经过“百炼”，怎能如此地颈肩柔转，臂指圆融呢。卡玛拉女士的脸上表情是无穷无尽的，一会儿欢欢喜喜，一瞬之间，又一变而为痛楚凄凉，又一变而为愤怒填胸，你简直有点赶不上她的变化。她的象牙色的十指，会表演出各式各样的姿态。在印度舞蹈艺术里手势的表演本来占很重要的地位。舞蹈家的十指尖尖，是会说出无穷尽的话语，无穷尽的情意来的。不仅如此，全身的各部分，特别是眉、眼、嘴、唇、面颊、颈、肩、臂、足，无不会说出各式各样的话语和情意的。卡玛拉女士的开合迅速的十指和眉、眼、颈、臂，是成功地而且优雅地达到了印度舞技的高峰了。见到她的一场舞蹈基本动作的表演。表演蜜蜂，仿佛就使观众像听到营营之声，渐飞渐近，绕着香花而转，而憩息了下来。表演双角岐嶷的牡鹿，就使我们见到它的确在惊奔着，双眼是那末恐怯。表演孔雀，就使我们觉得它是悠闲而高贵地在散步，在饮啄，在骄傲地张开锦色斑斓的尾屏。
    卡玛拉姊妹是从印度的南部大海港马德拉斯来的。马德拉斯是保存着印度风趣最醇厚的地方，也是印度舞蹈艺术的重要宝库之一。卡玛拉姊妹的婆罗多舞和其他的好些舞蹈都是属于南方一派的。但那不是说，他们就不擅长别的舞蹈了。卡玛拉女士的北方卡塔克舞，是那样地迷人。随着音乐的缓奏，手、足和眼、眉，逐渐舞开了。缓缓地挥着手，缓缓地转着足，铿锵悦耳的脚铃声，有节奏地响着，像天上彩虹似的百褶裙子，也有节奏地时张时合，眉眼之间仿佛含着无限的幽怨。突然地，舞步由缓而疾，乐声也急骤地变快了，表情也顿时紧张起来。手之舞之，足之蹈之，那姿态优美极了，就像一只五色缤纷的蝴蝶，在眼前飞翔着，就像彩色幻变不穷的虹霓在眼前闪耀着。看她那脸部的表情，也便是瞬息万变，和舞蹈的动作紧紧地结合无间，配合得奇妙可喜。
    卡玛拉姊妹的每场舞蹈都给予我们以二小时以上的无上的欢愉与欣爱。没有一秒钟容许你转眼他顾。一下子疏忽，或偶然地没有全神灌注的话，便会失去了一段、一节最美妙的柔姿妙态。舞蹈者以整个的身心，整个的感情，整个的灵魂在舞台上舞着，观众们也必须打叠起全副精神来观看。粗心大意的人是不会充分地欣赏得到其细致优美的好处的，但即使是他们，也绝对不会无动于中，不会不屏息宁神在观看着，而到了红幕垂下时才轻喟一口气的。
    乐队只有四个人，一位吹笛，一位击鼓，一位击磬兼歌唱，一位是导演，有时也参加歌唱。人数虽不多，却配合得十分紧凑。假如我们能够听得懂那些歌词，一定会更加感动的，但即使是不懂它们，而这场轻歌妙舞已足够使观众度过一个最有意义和最愉快的黄昏了。
    印度这个伟大民族，正和中国民族似的，蕴蓄着的是多大的力量，多末繁赜，多末丰富多采的文化艺术的遗产啊！是取之不竭，用之不尽的一个世界上最优秀艺术的源泉。
