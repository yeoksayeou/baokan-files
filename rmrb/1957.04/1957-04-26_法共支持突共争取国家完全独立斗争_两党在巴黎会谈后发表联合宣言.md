    French Communist Party Supports Tunisian Communist Party's Struggle for Complete National Independence
    Two Parties Issue Joint Declaration After Talks in Paris

    A delegation of the French Communist Party, headed by Jacques Duclos, Secretary of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, and a delegation of the Tunisian Communist Party, headed by Mohammed Ennafaa, Secretary of the Tunisian Communist Party, held talks in Paris. After the talks, the two parties' delegations issued a joint declaration stating that the French Communist Party delegation supports the Tunisian Communist Party's struggle for complete national independence and for overcoming the obstacles created by French colonialists and American imperialists. The French Communist Party supports the position of the Tunisian Communist Party and the Tunisian people in demanding the withdrawal of all French troops from Tunisia.
    The two parties' delegations firmly condemned the colonial war instigated in Algeria and demanded recognition of the Algerian people's right to independence.
    The two parties' delegations expressed satisfaction with the cooperation between France and Tunisia, especially in the economic and cultural fields. At the same time, the declaration pointed out that whether this cooperation can be consolidated and yield results depends on whether the French government abandons its colonial policy in North Africa.
    The two parties' delegations pointed out that the bankruptcy of the imperialist aggression against Egypt was primarily due to the growing power of the world's peaceful forces and the resolute support of the Egyptian people by the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all countries that recognize the Bandung spirit. The declaration called on the people of all countries to be vigilant, as the Near East remains threatened by new conflicts.
    Finally, the two parties' delegations emphasized the necessity of strengthening the unity and solidarity of the world communist movement, and pointed out the decisive role played by the Soviet Union in the struggle for peace and the liberation of colonial peoples.

    法共支持突共争取国家完全独立斗争
    两党在巴黎会谈后发表联合宣言
    以法国共产党中央委员会书记雅克·杜克洛为首的法国共产党代表团和以突尼斯共产党书记穆罕默德·恩纳法为首的突尼斯共产党代表团在巴黎举行了会谈。两党代表团在会谈后发表联合宣言说，法国共产党代表团支持突尼斯共产党为争取国家的完全独立以及克服法国殖民者和美国帝国主义者所制造的障碍而进行的斗争。法国共产党支持突尼斯共产党和人民要求把一切法国军队撤出突尼斯的立场。
    两党代表团坚决谴责在阿尔及利亚策动的殖民战争，并且要求承认阿尔及利亚人民的独立权。
    两党代表团对法突两国进行合作，特别是在经济和文化方面合作，表示满意。同时，宣言指出，这种合作是否能够巩固和收得成果，要看法国政府是否放弃在北非的殖民政策而定。
    两党代表团指出，帝国主义侵略埃及行为的破产，首先是由于各国和平力量的威力不断增长，由于苏联、中华人民共和国以及所有承认万隆精神的国家坚决地支持埃及人民。宣言要求各国人民提高警惕，因为近东依然存在着新冲突的威胁。
    两党代表团最后强调了加强世界共产主义运动团结一致的必要性，并且指出了苏联在争取和平和争取殖民地人民解放的斗争中所起的决定性作用。
