    "Return to the Countryside, Build a Socialist Homeland"
    This Year's Demobilization Work of the People's Liberation Army Begins

    (Our Newspaper News) The demobilized soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army this year, under the encouragement of the slogan "Return to the Countryside, Build a Socialist Homeland," are preparing to return to their hometowns to participate in agricultural production and construction. The Ministry of National Defense has decided to send demobilized soldiers starting in early April. Local governments have made preparations for resettlement, and many agricultural cooperatives are waiting for the returning comrades to work together to strive for a bumper agricultural harvest this year.

    To enable this year's demobilized soldiers to play a greater role in national construction, the PLA units have been conducting in-depth ideological education work for them for several months, organizing them to study the superiority of agricultural collectivization and relevant policies and regulations. During this period, commanders, division commanders, regimental commanders, political commissars, and directors of political departments from many units went deep into the companies to give lessons to demobilized soldiers in turn and talk with them. For example, General Deng Hua, the person in charge of the Shenyang garrison, personally went to several units to speak to the demobilized comrades, hold discussions with them, and answer questions, which the demobilized soldiers were very satisfied with. The units also generally invited local Party and government cadres and past demobilized comrades to make reports and discussed how to connect with the masses after demobilization, work hard, live frugally, work diligently, unite grassroots cadres, and other issues.

    Demobilized soldiers are full of confidence in returning to their hometowns to build a new socialist countryside. Yao Xi and 47 other demobilized soldiers from the Public Security Army, in an open letter, put forward seven requirements to the comrades who are about to be demobilized this year: obey organizational assignments, strictly abide by government policies and regulations, carry forward the fine qualities of hard work and simplicity of revolutionary soldiers, and contribute wisdom to the construction of the new countryside. They also initiated a revolutionary friendship competition. This initiative received a warm response from the vast number of demobilized soldiers. Seventeen veterans from a certain company of the Nanjing garrison guaranteed to the Party branch that after returning to their hometowns after demobilization, they would never be arrogant or complacent, but would share weal and woe with the masses, play an exemplary role in production, and be ready to respond to the call of the motherland to return to the army at any time. Many demobilized soldiers promised not to spend their production assistance funds indiscriminately but to invest them in production and bring the spirit of diligence and frugality in building the army back to their hometowns to diligently and frugally build cooperatives. The demobilized soldiers of the Fifth Company of a certain unit wrote in a resolution unanimously passed: Although we have taken off our military uniforms, we have not left the battle; we are going from battle to battle. We must become outstanding production experts in breaking through the peak harvest amount in our new battle posts.

    Many of the demobilized soldiers of the units have also actively visited the peasants near their garrisons and the demobilized comrades in the past to absorb various experiences. Many people have already made plans to use their production assistance funds and participate in agricultural production. Some have even bought hoes and books on agricultural production, preparing to participate in production as soon as they return to their hometowns.

    Local governments in various provinces are actively carrying out resettlement preparations for demobilized soldiers. For example, nineteen provinces and cities, including Jiangsu, Shandong, Liaoning, and Fujian, had already studied and deployed this year's demobilization and resettlement work as early as January and February. Many agricultural cooperatives have made arrangements for the work of demobilized soldiers. In addition to arranging work for comrades who are about to return to their hometowns after demobilization this year, Huangniling Agricultural Cooperative in Lanxi County, Zhejiang Province, is also preparing to invite past demobilized comrades to introduce their experiences in overcoming difficulties and becoming production experts. Longshan Township in Fengcheng County, Liaoning Province, has appropriately arranged the work of the nine comrades who will be returning to their hometowns after demobilization this year according to the technology, education level, and physical condition they learned in the army. Grassroots cadres and family members of demobilized soldiers in the rural areas of Jinghai County and Wuqing County, Hebei Province, hope that demobilized soldiers will rush back to participate in spring plowing and production, increase production strength, and strive for a bumper harvest together.

    “回到农村去，建设社会主义家乡”
    解放军本年度复员工作开始
    本报讯　中国人民解放军本年度的复员军人，正在“回到农村去，建设社会主义家乡”口号的鼓舞下，准备回乡参加农业生产建设事业。国防部决定从4月初起遣送复员军人，各地方政府已经做好安置的准备工作，许多农业社正等待复员同志回来，一道争取今年农业的大丰收。
    为了使今年的复员军人在国家建设事业中发挥更大的作用，几个月来，解放军各部队对他们深入地进行了思想教育工作，组织他们学习关于农业合作化的优越性和有关的政策法令。在这期间，许多部队的军长、师长、团长和政治委员、政治部主任，都深入连队，轮流给复员军人上课，并同他们谈话。例如沈阳驻军负责人邓华上将就亲自到几个部队给复员同志讲话，同他们座谈，解答问题，复员的战士们十分满意。各部队还普遍邀请地方党政工作干部和过去复员的同志作报告，并且讨论了复员后如何联系群众，艰苦奋斗，勤俭持家，努力生产，团结基层干部等问题。
    复员军人对于回乡建设社会主义新农村满怀信心。公安军复员军人姚喜等四十七人在一封公开信中，向今年即将复员的同志提出了服从组织分配、严格遵守政府政策法令、发扬革命军人勤劳朴素的优良品质、把智慧贡献给新农村的建设等七个条件，展开革命友谊竞赛。这一倡议，得到广大复员军人的热烈响应。南京驻军某连十七个老战士向党支部保证：复员回乡后，决不居功骄傲，要与群众同甘共苦，在生产上起模范作用，并且随时准备响应祖国的召唤重回部队。许多复员军人保证不乱花生产资助金，把它们投到生产中去，并且把部队勤俭建军的精神带回家乡勤俭建社。某部五连的复员军人在一致通过的决心书上写道：虽然我们脱下了军装，但并没有离开战斗，我们是从战斗走向战斗。我们要在新的战斗岗位上，成为突破丰收产额的出色的生产能手。
    许多部队的复员军人，还主动地访问了驻地附近的农民和过去复员的同志，吸取各种经验。很多人已订出了使用生产资助金和参加农业生产的计划，有的人还买了锄头和有关农业生产的书籍，准备一回乡就参加生产。
    各省地方政府积极进行复员军人的安置准备工作。例如江苏、山东、辽宁、福建等十九个省市，早在1、2月间就对今年的复员安置工作作了研究和布置。许多农业社已经为复员军人的工作做好了安排。浙江省兰溪县黄泥岭农业社除了为今年即将复员回乡的同志安排好工作外，还准备请过去复员的同志介绍自己如何克服困难、成为生产能手的经验。辽宁省凤城县龙山乡，已经根据今年将复员回乡的九位同志在部队所学的技术和文化程度以及身体条件，适当地安排了他们的工作。河北省静海县和武清县农村的基层干部和复员军人的家属，希望复员军人赶回来参加春耕大生产，增加生产力量，一同争取大丰收。（附图片）
