Voroshilov Chats and Laughs While Climbing Jingshan

Yesterday morning, the weather was beautiful, with a gentle breeze and warm sunshine, no less pleasant than the day before. Chairman Voroshilov, accompanied by the Mayor of Beijing, Comrade Peng Zhen, toured Jingshan Park, and viewed the cityscape of Beijing and the scenery of the nearby suburbs.

The distinguished guests were very interested when Comrade Peng Zhen told them the story of Emperor Chongzhen hanging himself on Coal Hill as they passed through Jingshan Park. They immediately got out of the car to visit the park.

A Medal Should Be Awarded to This Tree

Chairman Voroshilov ascended Jingshan from the eastern slope, heading straight to the summit, chatting and laughing all the way. While walking up the eastern slope of Jingshan, Comrade Peng Zhen pointed to the old tree, over three hundred years old, where Chongzhen hanged himself, and told Chairman Voroshilov that this was where the last emperor of the Ming Dynasty went bankrupt.

After hearing this story, Chairman Voroshilov humorously said to the people around him, "A medal should be awarded to this tree, because it gave the emperor a very good lesson."

Then, they talked about how Li Zicheng led the peasant uprising and captured Beijing. Comrade Peng Zhen also told the distinguished guests about the reasons for Li Zicheng's failure, saying: After Li Zicheng's army entered the city, they became corrupt, only focusing on enjoyment, and the morale of the soldiers was scattered, so they failed. At this time, someone exclaimed, "What a pity that there was no Marxism-Leninism at that time!"

"A Communist Will Never Give Up Halfway"

When climbing the mountain, Comrade Peng Zhen, afraid that he would be overtired, took his arm, wanting to help him, but he waved his hand away, and strode forward, like a young man stepping up two stone steps at a time, quickly reaching the Guanmiao Pavilion. When he reached the Zhoushang Pavilion, someone considered whether going to the top of the mountain would be too tiring; but Voroshilov insisted on his own opinion, repeatedly saying, "A communist will never give up halfway." With a vigorous pace, he went straight to the Wanchun Pavilion at the highest point of Jingshan. At the top of the mountain, the distinguished guests overlooked the entire city of Beijing, appreciating this beautiful ancient city.

When descending the mountain, on the western slope of the Fulanting, Chairman Voroshilov saw a white pine tree and ran down in surprise. He touched the bark of the tree and called his son over. P. K. Voroshilov left his wife and ran over. It turned out that they had not seen this kind of tree in the Soviet Union, and thought that the white color on the bark was painted on. After touching it, they realized that it was the natural color of the bark. Both father and son said that the white pine was very similar to the white birch of the Soviet Union.

"You are very brave, you can be a general in the future"

While touring Jingshan Park, Chairman Voroshilov greeted the elderly or children he encountered, walking over to shake hands with them kindly. Yang Shaozhong, an employee of the Beijing Pharmaceutical Company, was in the park enjoying the beautiful spring scenery with his two children and two other children. Chairman Voroshilov stepped forward and greeted the children kindly, and extended his hand to shake hands with them. Three of the children were at a loss and took a few steps back, but one of Yang Shaozhong's children stood still and tightly grasped Voroshilov's hand with his little hands. Voroshilov treated the child like a kind grandfather, smiling and saying to the child, "You are very brave, you can be a general in the future."

After visiting Jingshan Park, Chairman Voroshilov and others drove across the wide Beihai Bridge, out of Fuchengmen, and toured the nearby suburbs. Wherever they went, Voroshilov admired this beautiful city, and did not return to the city until half past twelve. He was still full of enthusiasm and not at all tired.

Comrade Peng Zhen was moved by the spirit of this old warrior and repeatedly said to the people around him: Chairman Voroshilov is already seventy-six years old. At such an advanced age, he is still so energetic and strong. He can truly serve as an example for us.

    伏罗希洛夫谈笑风生登景山
    昨天上午，风和日暖，天气美好，不减前日。伏罗希洛夫主席在北京市市长彭真同志的陪同下，游览了景山公园，并观看了北京市容和近郊景色。
    贵宾们经过景山公园时，从彭真同志的介绍中，知道了崇祯吊死煤山的故事后，都很感兴趣。当即下车到公园参观。
    应该给这棵树授勋
    伏罗希洛夫主席从景山东坡拾级而上，直达山顶，一路谈笑风生。在走上景山东坡时，彭真同志手指崇祯自缢的那棵已有三百多年的老树，告诉伏罗希洛夫主席，那就是中国历史上明朝最后一个皇帝破产的地方。
    伏罗希洛夫主席听完了这个故事，幽默地对人说：“应该给我们这棵树授勋，因为它给皇帝上了很好的一课。”
    然后，大家谈到了李自成如何率领农民起义，打进北京城的故事。彭真同志还向贵宾们谈到了李自成失败的原因，他说：李自成的军队进城后腐化了，只讲享受，兵心涣散，所以失败了。这时，有人发出了叹息：“可惜，当时没有马克思列宁主义啊！”
    “共产党员做事绝不半途而废”
    上山时，彭真同志怕他疲劳过度，挽着他的手，想搀扶他走，可是他摆开了手，迈开大步，就像是一个年轻人一步跨上两层石台阶，很快就走上观妙亭。当他到了周赏亭时，有人考虑上山顶是不是太累啦；伏老仍坚持自己的意见，连声说：“共产党员做事，绝不半途而废。”他以健壮的步伐，直上景山最高处万春亭。在山顶上，贵宾们俯瞰了北京全城的景色，欣赏着这座美丽的古城。
    下山时，在富览亭的西边山坡上，伏罗希洛夫主席看见一棵白皮松，惊奇地跑下去，手摸着树皮，叫他的儿子过来，彼·克·伏罗希洛夫就离开了夫人，跑过去，原来他们在苏联没有见过这种树，以为树皮上那层洁白的颜色是粉刷上去的，摸了一下，才知道就是树皮的本色，他们父子两人都说白皮松很像苏联的白桦。
    “你真勇敢，将来可以当将军”
    在景山公园游览时，伏罗希洛夫主席碰到老年人或者小孩子，都要亲切地走过去和他们握手。北京医药公司的一位工作人员杨绍忠带着自己的两个娃娃和别人的两个小孩，正在公园里欣赏美丽的春光，伏罗希洛夫主席走上前去和蔼地向孩子们打招呼，并伸出了手，要和他们握手，有三个孩子都不知所措，向后倒退了几步，其中只有杨绍忠的一个孩子站立不动，用他那双小手，紧紧地握着伏老的手。伏老对孩子就像一位慈祥的爷爷，笑吟吟地对孩子说：“你真勇敢，将来可以当将军。”
    伏罗希洛夫主席等在参观景山公园以后，乘汽车驶过宽阔的北海大桥，出阜成门游览了近郊景色，所到之处，都引起了伏老对这个美丽的城市的赞赏，一直到过午十二点半才转回城。他还是游兴勃勃，毫无倦意。
    彭真同志被这位老战士的精神感动得频频地对周围的人说：伏罗希洛夫主席已经七十六岁的高龄，这么大年纪了，还是那样精神矍铄，身强力壮，真可以作为我们这些人的榜样。

    伏老看到了一棵数百年的白杨树，他要亲自量一量这棵树到底有多少围粗。
