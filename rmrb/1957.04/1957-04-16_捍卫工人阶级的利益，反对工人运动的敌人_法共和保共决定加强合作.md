Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, April 15th: The statement of the meeting between the delegation of the French Communist Party and the delegation of the Bulgarian Communist Party, published in Sofia on April 15, stated that the two parties hold completely identical views on all issues discussed. Both sides believe that there is a long history of friendship and firm unity between the French and Bulgarian parties in the common struggle to defend the vital interests of the working class and oppose the enemies of the workers' movement.

The talks between the two party delegations took place from April 8 to 11, and discussed issues related to the current international situation, the struggle of the Bulgarian and French people to safeguard peace, the international workers' movement, and the development of relations between the two parties.

Regarding the Hungarian incident, the statement pointed out: Both sides fully agree with the Soviet Union's actions, because in this incident the Soviet Union fulfilled its internationalist obligations, responded to the call of the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, and played a decisive role in ensuring the crushing of the Hungarian counter-revolution, defending the Hungarian people's regime and socialist achievements, and defending European peace. Both sides fully agree with the resolute struggle of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government to defend socialist achievements and communist principles.

In the statement, the Bulgarian Communist Party delegation expressed its support for the French Communist Party's policy on Algeria, believing that this policy is in line with proletarian internationalism and the interests of the Algerian people and France itself.

The statement condemned the "Eisenhower Doctrine" and the imperialist illusion of suppressing national liberation movements in the Middle East and Africa by force. The statement pointed out that this imperialist approach is completely unworkable, and this problem can only be resolved by recognizing the unchangeable independent rights of the countries in the Middle East and Africa.

After pointing out the danger of West German rearmament, the two party delegations welcomed the efforts of the German Democratic Republic to strive for the establishment of a democratic and peace-loving Germany.

The two parties expressed their intention to continue the struggle for disarmament and the prohibition of testing and use of atomic weapons. Both sides believe that the Soviet Union's new proposals are a good basis for correctly resolving this task.

The two sides emphasized in the statement that it is extremely necessary to do their best to achieve the unity of the working class and the unity of action between communists and socialists. Because this is a condition for an effective struggle for peace, freedom, and social progress.

The statement condemned the imperialist conspiracy to slander the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, saying: The Communist Party of the Soviet Union was in the past, and remains today, the center of the international communist movement, and a rich source of experience for all communist and workers' parties. The national characteristics, special economic and political conditions, and traditions of the workers' movement of each country, which should be constantly noted, cannot in any way be grounds for doubting the fundamental significance of the Soviet experience.

The statement concluded by pointing out: The two parties have decided to take measures to strengthen mutual cooperation and exchange of experience in the future, strive to develop economic, trade, political and cultural ties between the two peoples and consolidate Bulgarian-French friendship, and contribute all their strength to the cause of peace, the happiness of the people, and socialism.

    法共和保共决定加强合作
    新华社索非亚15日电　4月15日在索非亚公布的法国共产党代表团和保加利亚共产党代表团会谈声明说，两党对所有讨论了的问题的观点完全一致。双方认为保法两党之间在捍卫工人阶级的切身利益和反对工人运动的敌人的共同斗争中存在着悠久的友谊和牢固的团结。
    两党代表团的会谈是在4月8日到11日进行的，讨论了有关目前国际局势、保法两国人民维护和平的斗争、国际工人运动、发展两党联系等方面的问题。
    声明在谈到匈牙利事件时指出：双方完全赞同苏联的行动，因为苏联在这次事件中执行了自己的国际主义义务，回答了匈牙利工农革命政府的呼吁，对保证粉碎匈牙利反革命、保卫匈牙利人民政权和社会主义成果以及对保卫欧洲和平，起了决定性的作用。双方完全赞同匈牙利社会主义工人党和匈牙利工农革命政府为保卫社会主义成果和共产主义原则所进行的坚决斗争。
    保共代表团在声明中表示赞同法国共产党对阿尔及利亚政策，认为这种政策符合无产阶级国际主义，也符合阿尔及利亚人民和法国本身的利益。
    声明谴责了“艾森豪威尔主义”和帝国主义幻想用武力镇压中东和非洲各国民族解放运动的企图。声明指出，帝国主义这样作是完全行不通的，只有在承认中东和非洲各国的不可改变的独立权利的情况下，才能解决这一问题。
    两党代表团在指出西德重新武装的危险以后，表示欢迎德意志民主共和国争取建立民主和爱好和平的德国的努力。
    两党表示要继续为裁减军备和禁止试验和使用原子武器进行斗争。双方认为苏联的新建议是正确解决这一任务的良好基础。
    双方在声明中强调指出：尽最大努力来实现工人阶级的团结和共产党人同社会党人之间的行动一致是非常必要的。因为这是为和平、自由和社会进步进行有效斗争的条件。
    声明谴责了帝国主义污蔑苏联共产党的阴谋，它说：苏联共产党过去是，现在仍然是国际共产主义运动的中心，是所有共产党和工人党取得经验的丰富源泉。每个国家的那些应该经常注意的民族特点、特殊的经济和政治条件和工人运动的传统，完全不能成为怀疑苏联经验的根本意义的根据。
    声明最后指出：两党今后决定采取措施加强相互间的合作和经验交流、为发展两国人民间的经济、贸易、政治和文化联系和巩固保法友谊进行努力，为和平、人民幸福和社会主义事业贡献出全部力量。
