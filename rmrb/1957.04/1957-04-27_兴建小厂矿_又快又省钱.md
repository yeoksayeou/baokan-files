Build Small Factories and Mines Quickly and Economically

    Tianjin　The iron and steel plants operated by Tianjin's local government are all small-scale. Over the past few years, with continuous small investments based on the original foundation, the steel output of the four steel plants has now exceeded that of the state-owned Tianjin Steel Plant. Due to the development of small-scale steelmaking and rolling mills, the output of steel and steel products in the first quarter of this year was more than 32% higher than the total output for the entire year of 1954.
    Jilin　Jilin Province has decided to build and expand a number of small factories and mines this year, all using indigenous methods of extraction to quickly produce the coal, iron, and other products most needed by the state. The small coal mines planned to be opened in Linjiang, Jingyu, and other counties can supply coal for local residents.
    Fujian　Fujian Province plans to invest in the development of thirty-eight medium and small-sized factories and mines this year, of which iron, graphite, and sulfur mines have recently been put into production. Among the thirty-eight medium and small-sized factories and mines, except for a coal mine with an annual output of 200,000 tons and an iron smelting plant with an annual output of 20,000 tons which will be put into production next year, the others will be put into production in the third and fourth quarters of this year respectively. In this way, not only will the current shortage of raw materials for local industry and handicraft production in Fujian Province be solved, but some products can also support the construction of other provinces.
    Guangxi　The Guangxi Provincial Department of Industry has decided to invest one million yuan to build an iron plant with an annual output of more than 13,000 tons of gray cast iron, and the entire investment can be recovered in just four years. In order to properly arrange for the personnel streamlined from local industries, Guangxi Province has also decided to build a number of mines using relatively simple machinery and equipment and manual mining.
    Jiangsu　Jiangsu Province is preparing to vigorously develop small-scale mining this year. The projects that have been decided upon include: aluminum, zinc, and coal in Nanjing; iron, coal, copper, alum, bauxite, marble, and graphite in Zhenjiang Prefecture; iron, coal, manganese, marble, and quartz in Suzhou Prefecture; iron, iron sulfide, coal, and white sand in Yangzhou Prefecture; and coal, asbestos, and mica in Xuzhou Prefecture. Together with the original local mining industry, it is planned to produce 267,000 tons of iron ore, 63,000 tons of coal, more than 3,740 tons of copper ore, and more than 3,400 tons of manganese ore this year. The total value of production will increase by about 50% compared with last year. (Yang Shenxing)

    兴建小厂矿  又快又省钱
    天津　天津市地方经营的钢铁厂都是小型的，几年来在原有的基础上，陆续少量投资，现在四个钢厂的钢材产量已经超过了国营天津钢厂。由于发展小型炼钢、轧钢工厂，今年第一季度钢和钢材的产量，比1954年全年产量还多32％以上。
    吉林　吉林省决定今年新建和扩建一批小型厂矿，都采用土法开采以迅速生产国家最需要的煤、铁等产品。临江、靖宇等县计划开采的小煤窑，可以供应当地居民用煤。
    福建　福建省今年计划投资发展三十八个中、小型厂矿，其中铁、石墨和硫磺矿，已于最近投入生产。在三十八个中、小型厂矿中，除一个年产二十万吨的煤矿和年产二万吨的炼铁厂在明年投入生产外，其它都将在今年第三、四季分别投入生产。这样，不仅解决目前福建省地方工业和手工业生产原料不足的问题，有些产品还可支援外省的建设。
    广西　广西省工业厅决定用一百万元投资新建一座年产一万三千多吨灰口生铁的铁厂，全部投资只要四年就可以收回。为了妥善安排地方工业精简出来的人员，广西省还决定新建一批利用较简陋的机器设备和手工开采的矿山。
    江苏　江苏省今年准备大力开展小型采矿，已决定进行的有：南京的铝、锌和煤，镇江专区的铁、煤、铜、明矾、铝矾土、大理石和石墨，苏州专区的铁、煤、锰、大理石和石英，扬州专区的铁、硫化铁、煤和白砂，徐州专区的煤、石棉和云母。加上原有地方采矿工业，今年计划生产铁矿石二十六万七千吨、煤六万三千吨，铜矿石三千七百四十多吨，锰矿石三千四百多吨等，生产总值较去年增涨50％左右。　（杨慎行）
