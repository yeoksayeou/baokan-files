Thoughts Inspired by "Letting Go"
—Reflections on Studying Chairman Mao's Two Speeches at the Supreme State Conference and the National Propaganda Work Conference
Li Yi, Member of the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society

    Recently, I attended the Second Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee of the Jiusan Society, listened to the recordings of Chairman Mao's two speeches at the Supreme State Conference and the Central Propaganda Work Conference of the Communist Party of China, and studied and discussed them. Everyone felt that the more they chewed on them, the more flavorful they became, and the more they discussed, the more new things emerged. It is worth our careful chewing and slow swallowing for long-term study. These few shallow personal learning experiences are nothing more than a brick thrown to attract jade amidst a chorus of "letting go."

Two Stages, Two Methods

    From Chairman Mao's instruction that contradictions between ourselves and the enemy and contradictions among the people are two different types of contradictions, and therefore there are two different methods of resolution, I realized that this instruction not only taught us to "distinguish between ourselves and the enemy, and distinguish between right and wrong," and correctly handle these two different types of contradictions, but also summarized the laws of the two stages and two methods that the proletarian dictatorship and people's democratic dictatorship in the world communist movement must go through. The historical experience of the Soviet Union, China, or other people's democratic countries proves that in the early days after the proletariat seized power and established revolutionary rule, the proletariat, which has become the ruling class, must concentrate its main force, use the weapons of revolutionary dictatorship, use stormy movements to smash the old state apparatus, suppress counter-revolutionaries, carry out democratic reforms and social reforms, and carry out socialist transformation, in order to thoroughly change the old relations of production and class relations, and resolve the contradiction between ourselves and the enemy. Kautsky and the opportunists of the Second International did not recognize the importance of revolutionary dictatorship, and committed the error of capitulationism; the former leaders of Hungary did not do well in this regard and also suffered greatly. However, after the task of suppressing counter-revolutionaries is basically completed, the relations of production and class relations are basically changed, and the main task of the state apparatus shifts to socialist construction, contradictions among the people gradually rise to become the main contradiction in the country. At this time, the state power led by the proletariat must resolutely and step by step develop the democratic life of the country, establish and improve the people's legal system, establish an academic and social atmosphere of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, promote the working method and working style of the mass line, criticize dogmatism and sectarianism, correct the method of treating contradictions among the people with crude suppression, advocate the method of unity-criticism-unity of gentle breeze and fine rain to resolve contradictions among the people, and formulate necessary methods and measures to adjust the relationship between the party and the masses, class relations and ethnic relations. In short, it is necessary to "let go," to use the method of developing socialist democracy to handle contradictions among the people. Since last year, our country has taken a series of measures to develop the democratic life of the country and promote the transition from the first stage to the second stage, which has played a great role in uniting all forces that can be united and transforming negative factors into positive factors. Therefore, we can say that Chairman Mao has summarized the historical experience of the proletarian dictatorship in the world, discovered an important law of the proletarian dictatorship, and enriched and developed Marxism-Leninism.

Let's Also Talk About "Early Spring Weather"

    The article "Intellectuals' Early Spring Weather" by Mr. Fei Xiaotong, published in the People's Daily on March 24, has attracted a lot of attention, and is considered to reflect the mood of some senior intellectuals and to have taken the pulse of some. I read Mr. Fei's article twice and felt that it did reflect the mood of some senior intellectuals (mainly senior intellectuals engaged in social sciences), and the article was light and cheerful, simple and easy to understand, and especially gave people a fresh and cordial feeling after reading it, without smelling the suffocating dogmatic and stereotyped atmosphere; however, among the senior intellectuals I have contacted, especially those in the field of science and technology, there are some situations that are not entirely the same. Many middle-aged and older senior intellectuals, especially those in the field of science and technology, have undertaken extremely heavy tasks in the national construction cause in recent years. Their work is intense and their mood is happy. When they see their motherland becoming more and more prosperous and strong every day, and the results of the motherland's construction cause in which they personally participated growing up batch by batch, they will feel how glorious and happy it is to be a senior intellectual in a new China! Decades of experience and the comparison between the old and new societies have made many of them clearly realize that liberation has not only brought spring to the people of the whole country, but also brought spring to intellectuals. When they occasionally recall the situation of eating cheap rice, exchanging "Yuan Datou", factional infighting, and the inability of heroes to use their talents in the old society, how can they not unconsciously hum a few lines of the song "The sky in the liberated area is a bright sky" with the young people?

    Of course, in the past few years, in several stormy social reform movements, many intellectuals have indeed become dizzy, weakened, and felt that the north wind is terrible and the cold is pressing. However, for most intellectuals, these few movements are not so much like the cold winter, but rather like a few snowstorms in early spring. Although the north wind is strong, it is still early spring weather after all. It should not only not hinder the vitality, but also have a great disinfection and sterilization effect, providing favorable conditions for welcoming the coming season of spring warmth and blooming flowers. Therefore, in the discussion, several professors said: "The ideological transformation of gentle breeze and fine rain in the future is very good, but the past few major movements were also necessary to shake things up. Without the past shaking, it would be difficult to have today's gentle breeze and fine rain and the contention of a hundred schools of thought." As a middle-aged and older intellectual, thinking carefully, I welcome the warm south wind and also appreciate the past few north winds. Because the historical experience of the proletarian dictatorship tells us that without the first stage of stormy winds and rains, there would be no second stage of gentle breeze and fine rain.

The Key Lies in the Initiative of Both Parties

    In several reports, Chairman Mao not only repeatedly explained the principle of "letting go" in theory, but also put forward a series of concrete measures to create conditions for "letting go." At the meeting, some comrades were very interested in the fact that the Party Central Committee was about to convene a meeting to discuss united front work, to organize people's representatives and CPPCC members to check the problems of improper handling in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, especially the Party Central Committee's repeated expression of its determination to vigorously implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" and "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," and the far-reaching rectification and study movement that will begin next year. They felt that the transmission and study of Chairman Mao's report could play a role like the awakening of insects by spring thunder; coupled with the above-mentioned spring breeze and spring rain, there is no worry that the atmosphere cannot be changed, and the situation of "in the third month of late spring, the grass grows in Jiangnan, miscellaneous flowers and trees, and swarms of orioles fly" cannot appear. Therefore, they felt relaxed, full of spring, and prepared to contribute their strength in the process of "letting go." However, it is certain that there will not be too few people who hold a skeptical attitude, think that there are many difficulties, that it is difficult to change deep-rooted habits, that it will be difficult to implement in ten or eight years, and therefore act slowly and adopt a wait-and-see attitude.

    To resolve contradictions among the people, everyone should take the initiative. From Chairman Mao's report, we have strongly felt the determination of the leadership and the great efforts being made; as the other side of the contradiction, we intellectuals should also carry forward our fine tradition of loving the motherland, loving the truth, being diligent and brave, and taking the world as our responsibility, and fulfill our due responsibilities with a positive and proactive attitude as masters of our own affairs.

    从“放”想起
    ——学习毛主席在最高国务会议和全国宣传工作会议上的两次讲话的体会
    九三学社中央委员　李毅
    最近参加九三学社的四届二中全会，听了毛主席在最高国务会议和中共中央宣传工作会议上的两次讲话的录音，并进行了学习和讨论，大家感到越嚼越有味，越讨论越有新东西，很值得我们细嚼缓咽，长期学习。这几点粗浅的个人学习心得，无非是在一片“放”声中的抛砖引玉而已。
    两个阶段、两种办法
    从毛主席关于敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾是两种不同性质的矛盾，因而也有两种不同的解决办法的指示中，我体会到这一指示不仅教导了我们“分清敌我、分清是非”，正确地处理这两种性质不同的矛盾；而且也总结了世界共产主义运动中无产阶级专政和人民民主专政所必须经历的两个阶段和必须采取的两种办法的规律。无论是苏联、中国或其他人民民主国家的历史经验都证明：在无产阶级取得政权建立革命统治的初期，已成为统治阶级的无产阶级，必须集中主要力量，以革命专政的武器，以狂风暴雨的运动，打碎旧的国家机器，镇压反革命，进行民主改革和社会改革，进行社会主义改造，以彻底改变旧的生产关系和阶级关系，解决敌我矛盾。考茨基和第二国际的机会主义者，不承认革命专政的重要，犯了投降主义的错误；匈牙利的前领导人员在这方面没有做好，也吃了很大苦头。但是在肃反任务基本完成、生产关系、阶级关系基本改变、国家机器的主要任务转向社会主义建设以后，人民内部的矛盾就逐渐上升成为国内的主要矛盾。这时，无产阶级领导的国家政权，就必须坚决地有步骤地发展国家的民主生活，建立和健全人民法制，树立百花齐放、百家争鸣的学术风气和社会风气，提倡群众路线的工作方法和工作作风，批判教条主义和宗派主义，纠正以粗暴的压制的办法来对待人民内部的矛盾，提倡以和风细雨的团结——批评——团结的办法来解决人民内部的矛盾，并制定必要的办法和措施，来调整党群关系、阶级关系和民族关系。总而言之，就是要“放”，要用发展社会主义民主的办法来处理人民内部矛盾。我国从去年起就采取了一系列的措施，来发展国家的民主生活，推动从第一阶段向第二阶段的转变，对团结一切可能团结的力量，化消极因素为积极因素，起了很大作用。所以，我们可以说：毛主席总结了世界无产阶级专政的历史经验，发现了无产阶级专政的一条重要规律，丰富和发展了马克思列宁主义。
    也谈谈“早春天气”
    3月24日人民日报发表的费孝通先生的“知识分子的早春天气”一文，引起很多人注意，认为反映了一部分高级知识分子的心情，摸到了一部分脉搏。费先生的文章，我读了两遍，感到确是反映了一部分高级知识分子（主要是搞社会科学的高级知识分子）的心情，而且文章轻松愉快，深入浅出，读后尤其使人有新鲜亲切之感，闻不到闷人的教条八股气息；但是在我所接触的高级知识分子中，特别是在科学技术界人士中，却有一些不尽相同的情况。很多中年以上的高级知识分子，特别是科学技术界人士，几年来在国家建设事业中担负了极为繁重的任务，他们的工作是紧张的，心情是愉快的，当他们看到自己的祖国一天比一天繁荣富强，自己亲自参加的祖国建设事业的成果，一批一批的成长起来时，他们会感到作为一个新中国的高级知识分子是何等的光荣和幸福！几十年来的遭遇，新旧社会的对比，使他们中间很多人很清楚地体会到：解放，不仅给全国人民带来了春天，也给知识分子带来了春天。当他们偶尔回想起旧社会吃平价米、换“袁大头”、宗派倾轧、英雄无用武之地等等情况，怎能不在不知不觉中跟着青年们哼出几句“解放区的天是明朗的天”的歌声来呢？
    当然，几年来在几次狂风暴雨的社会改革运动中，的确也使不少知识分子头昏眼花、气衰力弱，感到北风可畏、寒气逼人。但是对于大多数知识分子来说，这几次运动与其比作凛冽的严冬，不如说是初春里几阵风雪。北风虽劲，但究竟已是初春天气，非但不应阻杀生机，而且反有很大的消毒杀毒作用，为迎接即将到来的春暖花开时节，提供了有利条件。所以，在讨论中好几位教授说：“今后和风细雨的思想改造，很好，但是过去的几个大运动震动一下也是必要的。没有过去的震动，也很难有今天的和风细雨和百家争鸣。”作为一个中年以上的知识分子，仔细想想，我欢迎和煦的南风，也感激过去的几阵北风。因为无产阶级专政的历史经验告诉我们，没有急风骤雨的第一阶段，也就不会有和风细雨的第二阶段。
    关键在于双方主动
    毛主席在几次报告中，不仅从理论上反复地阐明了“放”的道理，而且还提出了一系列具体措施，为“放”创造条件。在会上有些同志对党中央即将召开会议讨论统战工作，对组织人民代表和政协委员检查肃反中处理不当的问题，特别是对党中央一再表示的大力贯彻
  “百花齐放、百家争鸣”“长期共存、互相监督”方针的决心和明年即将开始的影响深远的整风学习运动，很感兴趣。他们感到毛主席报告的传达和学习，就可以起春雷般的惊蛰作用；再加上以上几阵春风春雨，不愁风气不能转移，“暮春三月，江南草长，杂花生树，群莺乱飞”的局面不能出现。因而感到四肢舒展，春意盎然，准备在“放”的当中贡献自己的力量。但是可以肯定：抱怀疑态度，认为困难重重，积重难返，十年八年也难贯彻下去，因而行动迟缓，采取瞧瞧再说的态度的人也不会太少。
    解决人民内部矛盾，大家都应该主动起来。从毛主席的报告里，我们已强烈地感到领导上的决心和正在进行的巨大的努力；作为矛盾的另一方面，我们知识分子也应发扬我们热爱祖国、热爱真理、勤劳勇敢、以天下为己任的优良传统，以积极主动的主人翁态度，尽到我们应尽的责任。
