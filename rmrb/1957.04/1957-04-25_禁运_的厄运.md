The Doom of "Embargo"
By a Commentator of This Newspaper

    The U.S. State Department issued a statement on the 20th, forced to agree to discuss with its "allies" the "relaxation" of the so-called "embargo" against China. In this statement, the U.S. government helplessly acknowledged the fact that although the U.S. was "reluctant and remains unwilling" to relax the "embargo" against China, the development of the situation has forced the U.S. to make some concessions, or the "embargo" would completely collapse. This reflects the increasingly difficult and embarrassing position of the United States on its "embargo" policy.

    The U.S. government has been trying to use this "embargo" policy to obstruct the economic development of our country and other socialist countries. But facts have long proved that it is not the socialist countries targeted by the U.S. "embargo" policy that have been harmed, but precisely those countries that implement the U.S. "embargo" order. Recently, even the mouthpiece of the American bourgeoisie, the "New York Herald Tribune," admitted that the West suffers the most from the embargo. The United States also uses the "embargo" as a tool for conducting the "Cold War," using it to obstruct normal international economic relations in order to facilitate the United States in maintaining a tense situation, while also using it to interfere in the foreign trade sovereignty of its "allies" in order to facilitate the United States' control and economic penetration of them. Therefore, from the beginning of its implementation, this policy has been opposed by people of all countries, especially the people of those countries who have suffered greatly from following the United States in implementing the "embargo." In recent years, among the bourgeoisie of many of America's so-called "allies," such as Britain, Japan, France, West Germany, and Canada, there has been growing dissatisfaction. Many countries have disregarded U.S. opposition and adopted "exception procedures" and other methods to expand trade with China.

    Recently, the industrial production and foreign trade of some major capitalist countries have shown signs of instability or slow development. The struggle among these countries for the limited market in the capitalist world is becoming increasingly fierce. The United States has launched a fierce trade war against its "allies," using various conditions to dump goods everywhere in the capitalist world market, encroaching on the commercial territory of other countries, while at the same time building high barriers and constantly increasing import restrictions. Under the dual pressure of economic difficulties and American offensive, these countries find the "embargo" even more unbearable. In order to suppress this dissatisfaction, the United States repeatedly emphasized the need to further strengthen the "embargo" in the previous period. But amidst the trade crisis warning sounds issued by many countries, Washington's scolding failed. Britain was the first to announce the lifting of the "total embargo" on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The Japanese government has also expressed a relatively firm attitude towards the demand for "relaxing the embargo." These are signals indicating that the U.S. government's attempt to continue to maintain its "embargo" policy unchanged is no longer possible.

    However, the current U.S. approach is actually a strategy of retreating in order to advance. In its statement, the U.S. State Department, while agreeing to "make certain modifications," stipulated that the "embargo" items against the Soviet Union and Eastern European people's democratic countries should be increased, and that the "exception procedure" should be "stricter." This means that it still wants to use a superficial concession to restore the United States' "effective" control over the "embargo" issue. In addition, reports say that the United States will adopt a "slowly, slowly" approach when negotiating with its "allies" on relaxing the "embargo." At the same time, the U.S. government has announced that it will "continue to unilaterally prohibit all trade with Communist China."

    These situations show that the United States is absolutely unwilling to give up the "embargo" as a "Cold War" weapon and the noose around the necks of its "allies." Therefore, if countries harmed by the "embargo" want to truly get rid of the shackles of the United States and achieve trade autonomy, they must continue to struggle with the United States.

    “禁运”的厄运
    本报评论员
    美国国务院在20日发表声明，被迫同意和它的“盟国”讨论“放宽”对中国的所谓“禁运”。美国政府在它发表的这个声明中，无可奈何地承认了这样一个事实：尽管美国是“一直不愿意并且现在仍然不愿意”放松对中国的“禁运”，但是，局势的发展使美国如不作出一点让步，“禁运”就会完全垮台。这反映美国在“禁运”政策上正陷于更加困难和狼狈的地位。
    美国政府一直企图以这个“禁运”政策，来阻挠我国和其他社会主义国家经济的发展。但是事实早已证明，受到美国“禁运”政策的损害的，不是这个政策所针对的社会主义国家，而恰恰是那些执行美国“禁运”令的国家。最近连美国资产阶级的喉舌“纽约先驱论坛报”也承认，受禁运之害最大的是西方。美国还把“禁运”当作进行“冷战”的工具，一面利用它来阻挠正常的国际经济关系，以便利美国维持紧张局势；一面又利用它来干涉它的“盟国”的对外贸易主权，以便利美国对它们的控制和经济渗入。因此，这个政策从它实施的开始，就受到各国人民，特别是追随美国实施“禁运”而大受其害的国家的人民的反对。近年来，在英国、日本、法国、西德、加拿大等许多美国的所谓“盟国”的资产阶级中，也产生了越来越大的不满。许多国家已经不顾美国的反对，采取了“例外程序”和其它一些办法，扩大对中国的贸易。
    最近，一些主要资本主义国家的工业生产和对外贸易，都出现了不稳或发展迟滞的征候。在这些国家之间争夺资本主义世界有限的市场的斗争，是愈来愈激烈了。美国对它的“盟国”展开了猛烈的贸易战，它利用种种条件在资本主义世界市场上到处倾销，侵夺其他国家的商业地盘，同时自己又高筑壁垒，不时增加入口的限制。在经济困难和美国进攻的双重压力下，这些国家对“禁运”也就更加感到难以忍耐了。为了压制这种不满情绪，美国在前一个时期曾经一再强调应当进一步加强“禁运”。但是在许多国家纷纷发出的贸易危机警报声中，华盛顿的?喝失灵了。英国首先宣布解除了对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的“全面禁运”。日本政府对于要求“放宽禁运”也表示了比较坚定的态度。这是一些信号，表示美国政府企图继续原封不动地维持它的“禁运”政策，已经是不再可能了。
    可是，美国目前的做法，实际上却是一种以退为进的策略。美国国务院的声明中，在同意“实行某些修改”的同时，规定要增加对苏联和东欧人民民主国家的“禁运”项目，并且要使“例外程序”“更加严格”。这就是说，它还想借表面上的一点让步来恢复美国在“禁运”问题上的“有效的”控制。此外，有消息说，美国在同它的“盟国”谈判放宽“禁运”问题时，还将采取“慢慢来”的办法。同时，美国政府还宣布，它将“继续单方面禁止对共产党中国的一切贸易”。
    这些情况说明，美国是绝不愿意放弃“禁运”这个“冷战”武器和加在它的“盟国”颈上的这根套索的。因此，受到“禁运”损害的各国若要真正摆脱美国的桎梏而达到贸易自主，还得同美国继续进行斗争。
