Xinhua News Agency, Paris, April 4th Dispatch: The French authorities' practice of indiscriminately using torture and repression in Algeria has not only aroused universal indignation among the French people, but has also led to serious divisions within the government itself.

According to some newspaper reports, the cabinet meeting on April 3rd was largely devoted to discussing the "pacification" methods used by the French army in Algeria. According to "Liberation," several ministers, such as Mitterrand, Defferre, Billères, and even Pineau himself, engaged in "fierce debates" with Minister of Defense Bourgès-Maunoury. Bourgès-Maunoury believed that large-scale suppression of the Algerian people was correct. However, the aforementioned ministers emphasized that sanctioning General de Bollardière, who resigned in protest against the government's cruel "pacification" methods in Algeria, would not quell the indignation of French society. The ministers also discussed the fact that former minister René Capitant refused to teach at the Faculty of Law of the University of Paris for the same reason.

Xinhua News Agency, April 6th Dispatch: TASS, Paris: French social organizations continue to protest the French military police's indiscriminate use of torture in Algeria. The French Protestant Federation condemned the authorities' collective repression measures against Algerian residents.

The Catholic Popular Republican Movement sent a delegation to meet with Prime Minister Mollet, handing him documents proving the existence of atrocities in Algeria.

    枪杆子解决不了阿尔及利亚问题
    法国政府内部掀起激烈争吵
    法国公众谴责当局的殖民镇压措施
    据新华社讯　塔斯社巴黎4日消息：法国当局在阿尔及利亚滥施拷打和镇压的作法不但在法国人民中引起了普遍愤慨，甚至在政府本身也因此发生了严重分歧。
    据一些报纸消息透露，在4月3日的内阁会议上，大部分时间用来讨论法国军队在阿尔及利亚使用的“绥靖”办法。据“解放报”消息，一些部长，如密特朗、德费尔、比伊埃尔，甚至比诺本人，都同国防部长布歇—莫努里展开了“激烈的争辩”。布歇—莫努里认为大规模镇压阿尔及利亚人民是正确的。但是上述几个部长都着重指出，制裁为反对政府在阿尔及利亚所实行的残酷的“绥靖”办法而辞职的德博拉迪埃将军，并不能平息法国社会人士的愤慨。部长们还讨论了前部长雷纳·加比唐因为同样原因而拒绝在巴黎大学法律系讲课这件事。
    据新华社6日讯　塔斯社巴黎消息：法国社会团体继续对法国军警在阿尔及利亚滥施拷打的行为提出抗议。法国新教徒联合会谴责当局对阿尔及利亚居民采用的集体镇压的措施。
    天主教的人民共和党曾经派了一个代表团去见政府总理摩勒，交给他一些证明在阿尔及利亚有暴行事实的文件。
