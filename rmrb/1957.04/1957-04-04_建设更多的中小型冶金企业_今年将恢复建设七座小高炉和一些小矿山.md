Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry recently decided to resume the construction of seven small blast furnaces and some small mines this year. These seven small blast furnaces can be put into production this year and next year, with a total annual output of 180,000 tons of pig iron. These small blast furnaces were not originally planned to be restored.
    In order to build more small and medium-sized enterprises, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has appropriately restricted the scale and investment of the three large steel enterprises planned for construction, and correspondingly reduced the investment in the "construction base" of these large enterprises. Several sets of rolling equipment originally planned to be used to build Anshan Iron and Steel will be used to build several small steel plants in other places. The various design institutes of this ministry are also studying the design work of small and medium-sized enterprises.
    The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry also determined that helping provinces and cities establish small and medium-sized metallurgical enterprises should be regarded as an important task. This ministry recently convened relevant planning staff from various provinces and cities in Beijing to discuss the development of local metallurgical industries. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry requested provinces and cities to raise issues in building metallurgical enterprises in their regions, and is prepared to provide assistance to the best of its ability in terms of technology or technical personnel.

    建设更多的中小型冶金企业
    今年将恢复建设七座小高炉和一些小矿山
    新华社3日讯　冶金工业部最近决定今年恢复建设七座小高炉和一些小矿山，这七座小高炉今明年可以投入生产，总共年产十八万吨生铁。这些小高炉是原来没有计划进行恢复的。
    为了建设更多的中小企业，冶金工业部把计划建设的三个大钢铁企业的规模和投资，作了适当的限制，并且相应地减少这些大企业“建筑基地”的投资。原计划用来建设鞍钢的几套轧钢设备，将用来在其它地方分建几个小钢铁厂。这个部的各设计院也正在研究中小企业的设计工作。
    冶金工业部还确定，把帮助各省市建立中小型的冶金企业当作一项重要的任务。这个部在不久以前曾经召集各省市有关的计划工作人员在北京座谈了发展地方冶金工业的问题。冶金工业部要求各省市提出在本地区建设冶金企业中的问题，并且准备从技术或技术人员方面，尽力给予帮助。
