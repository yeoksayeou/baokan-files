    Fresh Vegetables Appear on the Market in Beijing
    In Beijing, the once-tense vegetable supply issue has begun to ease. The amount of fresh vegetables such as spinach, bok choy, celery, radishes, fennel, and cucumbers on the market is gradually increasing, and prices are also decreasing. This situation will make consumers more satisfied.
    In previous years, this was the season when vegetables were abundantly available. This year, however, the amount of vegetables on the market is very small, and the prices are high. Take spinach as an example. During the same period last year, the daily market volume reached about one million jin, while this year's highest market volume is only 200,000 jin. In terms of price, last year's spinach was about two fen per jin, while this year's price was as high as one jiao or more per jin, but it has dropped to five or six fen in recent days. Last year, the daily market volume of bok choy was more than 100,000 jin, while this year it is only more than 20,000 jin, and the price difference is also significant.
    Why is this the case? The reasons are understood to be multifaceted:
    First, the spring this year was long and cold, especially after Qingming Festival, when there was a heavy snowfall, which affected the growth of vegetables and delayed the market season. In addition, the spring was cold and the ground was cold, and the phenomenon of vegetable seedling reduction was serious, and the cost of vegetables increased relatively, and the selling price was inevitably increased.
    Second, the construction land in the suburbs of Beijing has occupied a large number of vegetable gardens, which is also an important reason for the reduction of vegetables. For example, Sangziying and Shangcun in the western suburbs are famous for producing spinach (good quality and large quantity), but these vegetable gardens have been occupied. Although the state has planned to guide farmers to convert some large fields into vegetable gardens, it will take at least three years to reach the yield of the gardens.
    Third, in the case of insufficient vegetable supply, many unlicensed vendors engaged in speculative activities. They purchased vegetables from agricultural cooperatives at high prices, and then sold them at high prices (generally 20% to 30% higher than the state listed price, and some were one or two times higher). At present, the Beijing Vegetable Company and the industrial and commercial management departments of various districts are stepping up efforts to ban these unlicensed vendors.
    In the case of severe shortage of vegetables, the Beijing Vegetable Company has taken many measures, such as transferring a large number of vegetables from Henan, Shanghai and other places to supply at a loss (the state lost 1.5 million yuan in the first quarter alone). In addition, a large number of bean sprouts were made with mung beans and soybeans for supply, which shows that the government is responsible for the people's lives.　　　　　Lin Xi

    北京鲜菜上市
    在北京，曾经一度十分紧张的菜蔬供应问题，已开始得到缓和。菠菜、小白菜、芹菜、小萝卜、茴香、黄瓜等鲜菜上市量日渐增多，价格也随着下降。这种情况将会使消费者更加满意。
    往年，当前正是菜蔬大量上市的季节。今年，蔬菜上市量却很少，价钱也高。以菠菜为例，去年同期每天的上市量达到一百万斤左右，而今年的上市量最高只有二十万斤；从价格上说，去年每斤菠菜二分钱左右，今年每斤价高到一角多，这几天已降到五、六分钱。小白菜去年每天上市量为十几万斤，而今年只有二万多斤，价格也有悬殊。
    为什么会形成这种情况？据了解原因是多方面的：
    第一，今年春寒长，特别是清明以后下了一场大雪，影响菜蔬的生长，推迟了上市季节；加之春冷地寒，菜蔬减苗现象严重，蔬菜成本相对提高，售价也必然调高了。
    第二，北京郊区的基本建设用地，占用了大量的菜园，也是蔬菜减少的重要原因。例如，西郊嗓子营、尚村以产菠菜著名（质好量多），而这些菜园都被占用了。国家虽然有计划地领导农民把一部分大田改为菜园，但最少要三年以后才可能达到园田的产量。
    第三，在蔬菜供不应求的情况下，许多无照摊贩进行了投机活动。他们以高价向农业社收购蔬菜，然后高价出售（一般较国家牌价高出20％至30％，个别的高出一两倍）。目前北京市蔬菜公司和各区工商管理部门正在加紧取缔这些无照摊贩。
    在蔬菜十分缺乏的情况下，北京市蔬菜公司采取了许多措施，例如从河南、上海等地调运了大批菜蔬赔本供应（仅今年第一季度国家赔本一百五十万元）；另外，利用绿豆和黄豆泡制了大批豆芽供应等等，这都说明政府对人民的生活是负责任的。　　　　　林晰
