Dalian, April 25th (By our newspaper) - A Soviet advanced technique recently adopted by the Dalian Mining and Industrial Vehicle Factory can rejuvenate old machines and old parts, even bring them back to life. This advanced technique is called metal spraying. By plating a thin layer of metal on machine parts that have lost their precision due to wear, some scrapped parts can continue to be used and restore their original performance and specifications. The inevitable result of using this technology is that the machine equipment or various parts that need to be replaced due to scrapping each year will be greatly reduced, so it is an important method of saving metal materials. The Dalian Mining and Industrial Vehicle Factory recently used metal spraying to revive a scrapped shear main shaft, costing only ten yuan, while manufacturing a new shaft would cost seventy yuan. In addition, the repair time was also shortened from five days to one and a half days. Subsequently, the factory used this method to repair two other machines and achieved the same results.

In larger factories and transportation enterprises, a large number of machines and transportation equipment need to be overhauled every year, so if this new technology can be widely adopted, the economic benefits will be very significant.

    旧机器返老还童
    本报旅大25日电　大连工矿车辆厂最近采用的一种苏联先进经验，可以使老机器、老零件返老还童，甚至死而复生。这种先进经验，叫金属喷镀法。在因磨损而失去了精密度的机器部件上，镀上一层很薄的金属，可以使某些报废了的部件能够继续使用，并恢复了原有的性能和规格。采用这种技术的必然结果，是每年因报废而需要更换的机器设备或各种部件将大大减少，因此它是节约金属材料的一个重要方法。大连工矿车辆厂最近试用金属喷镀法，复活了一根已经废了的剪片机主轴，费用不过十元，而制造一根新轴则需要七十元。另外修理时间也由五天缩短为一天半。接着这个厂在修理另外两台机器时，也使用了这种方法，并获得了同样的效果。
    在较大的工厂和运输企业中，每年都有大量的橙器和运输设备需要检修，因此如果能够都广泛地采用这一新技术，经济效果将是很显著的。
