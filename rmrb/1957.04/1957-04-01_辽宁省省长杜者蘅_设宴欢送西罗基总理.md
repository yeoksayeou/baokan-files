Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, March 31st: Premier Viliam Široký arrived in Shenyang from Lushun-Dalian by special plane at 4:30 PM today and was warmly welcomed by over 3,000 people from all walks of life in Liaoning Province and Shenyang City. Among those who went to the airport to welcome him was Park Sung-chul, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, who came to greet the Czechoslovak government delegation on their way to visit North Korea.

That evening, Premier Viliam Široký and members of the Czechoslovak government delegation attended a farewell banquet hosted by Du Zheheng, Governor of Liaoning Province.

Premier Široký delivered a speech at the banquet, saying, "We have had fraternal and friendly visits in China and met with people from all walks of life in China. During these meetings, we were deeply impressed by the complete unity of the Chinese people, the unity and solidarity of the people's democratic united front under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and the great enthusiasm of the Chinese people for construction."

Premier Široký said that the great ideas of Marxism-Leninism and the idea of building socialism have become a tremendous material force in China. The Chinese Communist Party is the organizer and inspirer of the great strength of the Chinese people. The Chinese Communist Party has demonstrated profound creativity in applying Marxism-Leninism to the specific conditions of China. The Chinese Communist Party is good at educating its cadres to understand Marxism-Leninism and the ideas of socialist construction, and good at educating its people in the spirit of proletarian internationalism." Premier Široký, at this point, proposed a toast to the development of the Chinese Communist Party, to the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong.

Premier Široký continued, "In your region, we have seen China's already developed industry. The development of economic strength and the strengthening of national defense are guarantees of national independence and freedom. But this guarantee is primarily the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union." Premier Široký proposed a toast to the unbreakable unity and friendship between China and Czechoslovakia, to the further strengthening of the unity of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, and to the strong development of industry in the People's Republic of China.

Du Zheheng delivered a farewell speech at the beginning of the banquet, thanking the government and people of Czechoslovakia on behalf of the people of Liaoning Province for the great economic and cultural assistance they have given to Liaoning Province in its socialist construction. He pointed out that the mutual support between China and Czechoslovakia in socialist construction will increasingly strengthen the power of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, which is conducive to peace and the development of human progress. Du Zheheng concluded by proposing a toast to the close unity of the people of China and Czechoslovakia and the great unity of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, to the health of Premier Široký and all members of the delegation, and to the health of President Zápotocký.
