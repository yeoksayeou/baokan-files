Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The following is the full text of the report submitted by the Ministry of Commerce to the State Council regarding the cotton cloth supply in 1957:

State Council:

We now submit the following report to the State Council regarding the cotton cloth supply in 1957.

Due to the disasters of 1956, both the cotton production plan and the procurement plan could not be fulfilled. This year's production of cotton yarn and cotton cloth will be significantly lower than originally estimated. Originally, it was estimated that the state could procure 25.22 million dan of cotton from September 1956 to the end of August 1957, producing 5.6 million bales of cotton yarn and 186 million bolts of cotton cloth this year. Due to the nationwide floods that occurred in August and September of last year, cotton production plans were not fulfilled except in a few areas with good harvests. As of the end of March this year, the state had only procured 20.69 million dan of cotton, and it is estimated that it will be able to procure at most 22 million dan by the end of August, a reduction of 3 to 4 million dan from the original estimate. This will reduce this year's cotton yarn production plan to approximately 4.6 million bales, a decrease of about 1 million bales, and the cotton cloth production plan to approximately 149 million bolts, a decrease of about 37 million bolts. Based on the original estimate of producing 186 million bolts of cotton cloth this year, after deducting industrial cloth, public cloth, export cloth, military cloth, and national reserve cloth, it would still be possible to supply 157 million bolts of civilian cloth. Now, due to the reduction in cotton cloth production, after taking measures such as reducing cotton cloth exports significantly, drastically reducing public cloth, not allocating national reserve cloth this year, and appropriately reducing the year-end inventory of cotton cloth in the commercial sector, it will only be possible to supply 127 million bolts of civilian cloth this year, about 30 million bolts less than the original estimated supply.

Cotton cloth is a planned commodity supplied with coupons and quotas. The valid period for this year's cloth coupons (i.e., purchase certificates) is from September 1, 1956, to the end of August 1957. This is further divided into two periods: the first period is from September 1, 1956, to the end of April 1957, but can be used until the end of August 1957; the second period is valid from May 1, 1957, to the end of August. This year's cloth coupons were issued in July 1956, before the floods occurred. Estimates for cotton production, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth production were overly optimistic. A total of 157.11 million bolts of cloth coupons were issued, of which 102.12 million bolts were for the first period and 54.99 million bolts were for the second period. Due to lax control, some provinces issued additional cloth coupons themselves, approximately 7.2 million bolts. Therefore, the total number of cloth coupons issued this year is approximately 164 million bolts. Based on the assumption that the cloth coupon recovery rate is about 95% of the total issued, approximately 156 million bolts of civilian cloth need to be supplied this year. However, the state can only supply approximately 127 million bolts of civilian cloth. About 29 million bolts of cloth coupons will not be able to be redeemed for cloth. What should be done? This is the problem that needs to be solved urgently.

There are two ways to solve this problem. The first method is to universally halve the value of the second-period cloth coupons, valid from May to August 1957, in both urban and rural areas, i.e., two chi of cloth coupons can only purchase one chi of cotton cloth. The first-period cloth coupons will still be valid at full value, without discounts. By adopting this method, approximately 27 million bolts can be recovered from the issued cloth coupons in May to August. In addition, by strictly implementing the method of supplying cloth products requiring coupons, it is possible to achieve a balance between cotton cloth supply and demand this year. The second method is to guarantee that all cloth coupons for this year can be redeemed for cloth, reducing the amount of cotton cloth supplied in the next year, from September 1957 to August 1958, and diverting more than 20 million bolts of cloth to supply this summer, which is essentially "borrowing from the future." We have weighed the pros and cons of these two methods and believe that implementing the first method is more stable, while implementing the second method is not. Because implementing the first method involves reducing the supply of cotton cloth in the summer, when the weather is warm, reducing the supply of cotton cloth has a smaller impact on people's lives, and there are also undershirts and vests that do not require coupons, which can make up for some of the shortage of summer clothing. After taking this measure, the state will have enough cotton cloth to ensure the supply of winter clothing for the people after the autumn. If the second method is implemented, fewer cloth coupons will have to be issued for the winter period from September 1, 1957, to the beginning of 1958. At that time, due to the insufficient supply of cotton cloth in winter, many people may not be able to make cotton-padded clothes and cannot keep warm, which will have a great impact on people's lives. Moreover, autumn is the season when farmers sell a large amount of agricultural products. After selling agricultural products, farmers need to purchase a large amount of cotton cloth. Reducing the supply of cotton cloth at that time will also hinder the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. Therefore, we believe that we can only adopt the method of universally halving the value of the second-period cloth coupons in urban and rural areas, according to the principle of "less summer clothing, ensure winter clothing."

Because urban and rural people have different purchasing power, more cloth coupons have been issued in urban areas and fewer cloth coupons have been issued in rural areas when issuing cloth coupons in previous years. When considering discounting the second-period cloth coupons, we also considered whether we could discount more in urban areas and less in rural areas, instead of adopting a uniform halving method for urban and rural areas. After research, we believe that this idea is not feasible. Because the difference between the amount of civilian cloth supplied in urban and rural areas in our country is not very large. The average annual quota per person in urban areas is about 32 chi, and the average annual quota per person in rural areas is about 22 chi, a difference of only 10 chi. The second period of cloth coupons accounts for 35% of the total cloth coupons for the year. In the quota of the second period of cloth coupons, the average difference between urban and rural areas is only three and a half chi of cloth per person. After halving, the difference is only a little more than one chi of cloth. The urban population in our country is small, and the rural population is large. The amount of civilian cloth supplied in urban areas only accounts for about one-fifth of the total civilian cloth supply. If the second-period cloth coupons in rural areas are not halved but discounted by 60%, rural residents will only get a little more than seven cun of cloth per person, but urban areas will have almost no cloth to sell from May to August. Moreover, cloth coupons are mutually used in both urban and rural areas in the same region, and the boundaries between urban and rural areas are not easy to define. Therefore, it is more appropriate to universally halve the value of cloth coupons in both urban and rural areas.

We believe that the following lessons can be learned from the cotton cloth supply problem in 1957: Our country is still a country where agricultural production accounts for a very large proportion. Because natural disasters cannot be completely avoided, agricultural production is still unstable. Since 1953, we have experienced one year of average harvest, one year of good harvest, and two years of major disasters. During good harvests, raw materials for light industry and market commodities are relatively abundant, while during poor harvests, we feel that they are insufficient. In the future, we should pay attention to the reserves of raw materials and commodities during good harvests in order to make up for deficiencies and maintain the stability of light industrial production and commodity supply during poor harvests. At the same time, the Ministry of Commerce did not anticipate the difficulties that might arise due to the instability of agricultural production when issuing cloth coupons last year. It did not base the number of cloth coupons issued on a solid and reliable basis and issued too many cloth coupons, relaxing the supply. This is also a shortcoming in the work and should be corrected in the future.

After the second-period cloth coupons for this year are supplied at half price, the people cannot help but feel some difficulties. However, after the second-period cloth coupons for this year are supplied at half price, although the supply of civilian cloth for the whole year is reduced compared to 1956, it is still more than in 1953, 1954, and 1955. The situation in the past four years is as follows: in 1953, the country produced 4.1 million bales of cotton yarn and supplied 114.77 million bolts of civilian cloth; in 1954, 4.59 million bales of yarn were produced and 112.24 million bolts of civilian cloth were supplied; in 1955, 3.96 million bales of yarn were produced and 112.33 million bolts of civilian cloth were supplied; in 1956, 5.21 million bales of yarn were produced and 149.48 million bolts of civilian cloth were supplied. This year, in 1957, 4.6 million bales of yarn may be produced and 127 million bolts of civilian cloth may be supplied. From the above figures, it can be seen that the cotton cloth supply in 1956 was not normal, but particularly high. The reason why the supply was particularly high in that year was precisely because there were shortcomings in the work of the Ministry of Commerce. It did not recognize that in years of good cotton harvests, a portion of cotton cloth should be reserved in order to supply the people in years of poor cotton harvests. In 1933, the year with the highest yarn production before liberation, the country only produced 2.44 million bales of yarn, and the imported cloth and yarn were only equivalent to the quantity of more than 200,000 bales of cotton yarn. If the yarn production this year is compared with that before liberation, it can be seen that the consumption of cotton cloth by the people across the country has greatly increased. The difficulties we are currently encountering are difficulties in progress. We believe that as long as we tell the people the current actual situation, the people across the country will definitely cooperate with the government to overcome these difficulties.

The above opinions are submitted to the State Council for review.

### 削减夏季用布，保证冬季供应  商业部关于1957年棉布供应问题的报告

    削减夏季用布，保证冬季供应
    商业部关于1957年棉布供应问题的报告
    新华社19日讯　商业部关于1957年棉布供应问题向国务院的报告，全文如下：国务院：
    我们现在对1957年棉布供应问题向国务院提出以下的报告。
    因为1956年的灾害，棉花生产计划和收购计划都不能完成，今年的棉纱、棉布生产，将较原定的预计数有很大的减少。原来预计，由1956年9月到1957年8月底国家可以收购棉花二千五百二十二万担，今年生产棉纱五百六十万件，棉布一亿八千六百万匹。由于去年八、九月间，发生了全国性的大水灾，除少数丰收地区外，棉花没有完成生产计划。截至今年3月底，国家只收购了棉花两千零六十九万担，估计到8月底至多只能收购两千两百万担，比原来预计数要少收三百万至四百万担。这就使今年的棉纱生产计划减为四百六十万件左右，减少了约一百万件，棉布生产计划减为一亿四千九百万匹左右，减少了约三千七百万匹。按照原定的预计数，在今年生产棉布一亿八千六百万匹的基础上，减去工业用布、公用布、出口布、军用布和国家储备布以外，还可以供应民用布一亿五千七百万匹。现在由于棉布生产减少，在采取了减少棉布出口，大量削减公用布，今年不拨付国家储备布匹和适当减少商业部门的棉布年末库存等项措施以后，今年只能供应民用布一亿二千七百万匹，比原定的预计供应数少三千万匹左右。
    棉布是凭证定量的计划供应商品。本年度布票（即购布证）通用期限是由1956年9月1日到1957年
  8月底止。其中又分为两期：第一期是从1956年9月1日到1957年4月底，但可通用到1957年8月底；第二期是从1957年5月1日到8月底通用。本年度的布票，是1956年
  7月发出的，当时水灾还没有发生，对棉花生产和棉纱、棉布生产都估计偏高，一共发行了一亿五千七百一十一万匹布票，其中第一期为一亿零二百一十二万匹，第二期为五千四百九十九万匹。由于控制不严，有一些省份又自己加发了一部分布票，约七百二十万匹。因此本年度发出的布票总数，约在一亿六千四百万匹左右。按布票收回率约占发票总数的95％计算，本年度需要供应的民用布为一亿五千六百万匹左右，但是国家可能供应的民用布只有一亿二千七百万匹左右，约有二千九百万匹布的布票不能买到布匹，应当怎么办，这就是当前需要解决的问题。
    解决这个问题，可以有两种办法。第一种办法是将1957年5至8月通用的第二期布票，城乡一律对折使用，即两尺布票购买一尺棉布，第一期布票照旧通用，不折扣。采取这个办法，可以把已经发出去的布票，在5至8月折回二千七百万匹左右，再加上已规定应收布票的布制品严格执行凭证供应办法，可以达到本年度棉布供求的平衡。第二种办法是保证本年度的布票全部买到布匹，削减由1957年9月到1958年8月的下年度棉布供应量，挪用两千多万匹布放到今年夏季来供应，也就是寅吃卯粮的办法。我们权衡了这两种办法的利弊，认为实行第一种办法比较稳妥，而实行第二种办法则是不稳妥的。因为实行第一种办法，是在夏季削减棉布供应量，这时天气暖和，少供应一部分棉布，对人民生活的影响较小，而且还有汗衫、背心不需凭票供应，可以弥补一部分夏衣的不足。在采取了这项措施以后，国家就有足够的棉布力量在秋后保证人民冬衣的供应。如果实行第二种办法，由1957年9月1日到1958年年初的冬季布票就要少发，那时由于冬季棉布供应不足，可能使许多人做不上棉衣，不能御寒，对人民生活的影响很大。而且秋后是农民大量出售农产品的季节，农民在出售了农产品以后，需要大量购买棉布，那时棉布供应削减，也会妨碍城乡物资交流。因此我们认为只能根据“少添夏衣，保证冬衣”的方针，采取将第二期布票城乡一律对折使用的办法。
    因为城市和乡村人民购买力不同，历年发行布票的时候，都采取了城市多发一些布票，乡村少发一些布票的做法。在考虑将第二期布票打折扣的时候，我们也曾经设想过，是否可以城市折扣多打一些，乡村折扣少打一些，而不采取城乡一律对折的办法。经过研究的结果，认为这种想法是行不通的。因为我国城市和乡村民用布供应数量的差别并不很大，城市每人全年平均定量约三十二尺，乡村每人全年平均定量约二十二尺，相差只有十尺。第二期布票占全年布票总数的35％，在第二期布票的定量中，城乡每人平均只差三尺半布，在打了对折以后，就只差一尺多布了。我国城市人口少，乡村人口多，城市民用布供应量只占民用布供应总量的五分之一左右，如果乡村的第二期布票不打对折而改打六折，乡村居民每人只多得了七寸多布，但是城市5至8月就几乎无布可卖了。而且布票在同一地区中城乡互相通用，城乡界限不易划分。因此还是以城乡一律对折较为适宜。
    我们认为，从1957年棉布供应问题中，可以得出以下的教训：我国还是一个农业生产占有极大比重的国家，由于自然灾害不能完全避免，农业生产还是不稳定的。自从1953年以来，我们遇到过一次平收，一次丰收，两次很大的灾害。丰收时轻工业原料和市场商品都较充裕，歉收时则感到不足。今后应当在丰收时注意原料和商品的储备，以便以丰补歉，保持歉收时轻工业生产和商品供应的稳定。同时，商业部在去年发行布票的时候，没有估计到由于农业生产不稳定而可能发生的困难，没有把发行布票的数字放在稳妥可靠的基础上而多发了布票，放宽了供应，这也是工作中的缺点，以后应当纠正的。
    本年度第二期布票对折供应以后，不能不使人民感到一定的困难。可是本年度第二期布票对折供应以后，本年度全年民用布的供应量虽然比较1956年是减少了，但是仍然比1953年、1954年、1955年这三年为多。过去四年的情况是这样：1953年全国生产棉纱四百一十万件，供应民用布一亿一千四百七十七万匹；1954年产纱四百五十九万件，供应民用布一亿一千二百二十四万匹；1955年产纱三百九十六万件，供应民用布一亿一千二百三十三万匹，1956年产纱五百二十一万件，供应民用布一亿四千九百四十八万匹。今年即1957年产纱四百六十万件，可能供应民用布一亿二千七百万匹。从以上数字可以看出，1956年的棉布供应并不是正常的，而是特别多的，这一年供应特别多的原因，正是由于商业部工作上有缺点，没有认识到棉花丰收年份，应该储备一部分棉布，以便在棉花歉收年份，供应人民。解放前产纱最多年份的1933年，全国产纱量只有二百四十四万件，进口的布和纱，也不过相当于二十多万件棉纱的数量。如果把今年的产纱量同解放前相比较，可以看出，全国人民的棉布消费量，已经有了很大的增长。我们目前所遇到的困难，是前进中的困难。我们相信，只要把目前实际情况告诉人民，全国人民一定会同政府合作，克服这些困难。
    以上意见，请国务院审议。
