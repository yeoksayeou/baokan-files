    State Personnel
    Should Be Models for the Masses
    Sun Daqian

    I have a younger brother who is graduating from elementary school this year, so I am very concerned about the issues of further education and employment for primary and secondary school graduates. Because I recognize my great responsibility, I would like to share my opinions on this matter.

    First, I hope that the national education departments will build as many schools as possible and enroll more students. At the same time, I hope that existing schools will leverage their potential, utilizing existing manpower and school buildings to add classes and implement a two-shift system. Furthermore, we should mobilize the forces of government organizations, social groups, and the masses to establish schools, evening schools, and tutoring classes.

    Second, from now until the summer vacation, primary and secondary schools should focus on labor education and conduct ideological and political education for primary and secondary school graduates. This can be done through reports, seminars, visits to factories and agricultural cooperatives, and joint gatherings with past primary and secondary school graduates who have participated in production labor, and so on. Education departments and publishing organizations should compile and print brochures about the deeds of labor models among graduates who have participated in production and about production labor for students to read in their spare time. Schools should strengthen the organizational life of the Communist Youth League and Young Pioneers, combining it with labor education.

    Third, primary and secondary school students are found throughout rural and urban areas and include the children of people from all social strata. Therefore, the issues of further education and employment for primary and secondary school graduates are social issues. Since they are social issues, people from all social strata and all walks of life should take on the responsibility of resolving them. First, we ourselves should correctly approach the issues of further education and participation in productive labor for primary and secondary school graduates and widely promote this in society to create social opinion.

    Parents bear direct responsibility for educating and raising their children. Parents' understanding and attitude have a great impact on their children, even a decisive one. As parents, we should not blame our children if they fail to be admitted to schools, but rather educate and guide them to participate in productive labor. I have a younger sister who graduated from elementary school last year but failed to be admitted to middle school. She was very sad, often cried, and even wanted to take the school entrance exam again this year. On the one hand, I pointed out her shortcomings in learning; on the other hand, I comforted her and encouraged her to seek employment. Later, she was admitted to a factory as an apprentice. If my younger brother does not get into middle school this year, I will still encourage him to seek employment. If he does not have a suitable job, I will ask him to join the agricultural cooperative. I have already begun to educate him.

    What needs to be especially emphasized is that the children of state organ personnel account for a considerable proportion of primary and secondary school graduates. The parents of these students should lead by example and become models for the masses in handling this issue. In the past, some comrades, and even individual responsible cadres, would ask the education department for extra consideration when their children failed to be admitted to schools. This practice is wrong. State personnel in this matter have only the obligation to abide by the national education system and set an example for the masses, and should not have any special rights. If the children of state personnel fail to be admitted to schools, they should be encouraged to participate in productive labor. Doing so will have a great impact on the general public and their children.

    国家工作人员
    应当作群众的模范
    孙达谦
    我有一个今年从小学毕业的弟弟，因此，我对中小学毕业生的升学和就业问题，是很关心的。由于我认识了自己的责任很大，就这个问题谈谈我自己的意见。
    首先，我希望国家教育部门，尽可能多办些学校，多招收些学生。同时希望现有学校，发挥潜力，利用现有人力、校舍，增添班级，增办二部制。再就是动员机关团体、社会群众力量办些学校、业余学校和补习班等。
    其次，从现在起到暑假以前中小学应以劳动教育为中心，对中小学毕业生进行思想政治教育。进行方式可采取报告、座谈、参观工厂、农业合作社，以及同过去参加生产劳动的中小学毕业生举行联欢座谈等等。教育部门和出版机关，编印些参加生产的毕业生的劳动模范事迹及有关生产劳动的小册子，供学生业余阅读。学校要加强团、队的组织生活，结合进行劳动教育。
    第三，中小学生遍及乡村、城市，包括着社会各阶层人民的子弟。所以，中小学毕业生的升学、就业问题，是个社会性的问题。既然是社会性的问题，就要社会各阶层人民、各界社会人士都担起解决这个问题的责任。首先自己应当正确的对待中小学毕业生升学和参加劳动生产的问题，并在社会上广泛地进行宣传，造成社会舆论。
    家长是直接担负对子弟的教养责任的，家长的认识和态度如何，对子弟起很大的作用，甚至起着决定性的作用。做家长的，对子弟考不取学校，不要责难，应当教育引导他们参加劳动生产。我有个妹妹去年小学毕业，未考取中学，她非常难过，常哭，还想今年再考学校。我一方面指出她学习上的缺点，一方面安慰她，动员她就业。后来考上一个工厂当了学徒。今年我的弟弟如果考不上中学，还是动员他就业，如果没有适当职业，就叫他参加农业合作社。现在我已经开始对他进行教育。
    特别需要提出的，国家机关工作人员的子弟，在中小学毕业生中占不小的比例。这些学生的家长，应当以身作则，在处理这个问题上应当成为群众的模范。过去曾经有些同志甚至有个别负责干部，子弟考不取学校，就请教育部门给以额外照顾，这种做法是不对的。国家工作人员在这个问题上，只有遵守国家教育制度和做群众榜样的义务，而不应该有特殊的权利。国家工作人员的子弟没考取学校，应该动员他们参加生产劳动。这样做，给一般群众家长和子弟的影响，将是很大的。
