Moscow Dispatch from our Newspaper, April 16th: The Soviet people are extremely excited to have learned from newspapers and radio broadcasts about the arrival of Kliment Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, in Beijing, where he received a grand welcome from the citizens of Beijing, as well as the news that Chairman Voroshilov paid a visit to Chairman Mao Zedong and that Chairman Mao invited Chairman Voroshilov to dinner. "Pravda," "Izvestia," "Red Star," "Trud," and "Komsomolskaya Pravda" all devoted a large portion of their front pages to these reports, as well as to Chairman Mao's welcoming remarks at the airport and Chairman Voroshilov's speech at the airport. "Pravda" published a photo of Chairman Voroshilov with Chairman Mao, Vice-Chairman Zhu De, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and Premier Zhou Enlai at the airport. Other newspapers published photos of Chairman Voroshilov and Chairman Mao waving their hats to the welcomers as they left the airport. The headline in "Pravda" was "Long Live the Unbreakable Fraternal Friendship Between the Peoples of the Soviet Union and China." A special correspondent for "Izvestia" wrote: "This day marked a grand review of the eternal friendship and solidarity between the two great peoples."
