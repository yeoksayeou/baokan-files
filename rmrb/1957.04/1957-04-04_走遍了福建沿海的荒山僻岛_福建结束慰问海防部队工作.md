Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 3rd. The Fujian people and local garrison leadership jointly formed a delegation to console the Fujian front coastal defense troops, and all returned from the front on the 1st. The representatives told our reporter that the People's Liberation Army's spirit and deeds of being loyal to the motherland, loyal to socialist construction, enduring hardship, and overcoming difficulties have profoundly educated the members of the delegation. The delegation will widely publicize these deeds to the people, making them known to every household, and everyone will learn from the People's Liberation Army.

In the forty to fifty days, the delegation members traveled all over the remote islands and desolate mountains of the Fujian coast, consoling the vast number of officers and soldiers on the coastal defense line. Zhang Jianzhong, a worker from the Fuzhou Machine Factory, introduced the story of how soldier Li Maoyou used two yuan to make a measuring device worth more than fifty yuan. He said: "We workers must learn from the PLA's spirit and create more wealth for the country."

The representatives also brought back a batch of gifts from the soldiers, including steel chisels that had been worn down from more than five feet long to two or three inches, patched kerosene lamp shades that had been repaired more than ten times, models of inventions and creations, and pictures and trophies of battles against the Chiang Kai-shek troops.

    走遍了福建沿海的荒山僻岛
    福建结束慰问海防部队工作
    新华社福建前线3日电　慰问福建前线海防部队的福建人民和当地驻军领导机关联合组成的慰问团，已于1日全部从前线归来。代表们向本社记者说，人民解放军忠于祖国，忠于社会主义建设，忍受艰苦，克服困难的精神和事迹，深刻地教育了代表团人员，代表团将把这些事迹广泛向人民传达，作到家喻户晓，人人向解放军学习。
    慰问团代表们在四十天到五十天的时间内，走遍了福建沿海的荒山僻岛，慰问了海防线上的广大官兵。福州市机器厂工人张健钟介绍了战士李茂有用两元钱制出一个价值五十多元的测度器的事迹，他说：“我们工人要学习解放军这种精神，为国家创造更多的财富。”
    代表们还带回一批战士们送给他们的礼品，其中有从五尺多长磨成两三寸长的钢钎，有补了十几次的破煤油灯罩，有创造发明的模型，还有同蒋军作战的图片和胜利品等。
