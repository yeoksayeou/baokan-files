Xinhua News Agency, April 4th. The Hungarian Embassy in China held a reception in Beijing tonight to celebrate the 12th anniversary of Hungary's liberation. Chargé d'affaires ad interim Šár said at the reception that the Hungarian people will always be grateful for the assistance given by the people of socialist countries during Hungary's difficult times.

Vice Chairman Zhu De, Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premiers Li Xiannian and Nie Rongzhen, Vice Chairmen Shen Junru and Peng Zhen, President of the Supreme People's Court Dong Biwu, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, heads of various departments of the Chinese government and people's organizations, and more than 300 people including diplomatic envoys and diplomatic officials from various countries in China were invited to attend the reception.

Chargé d'affaires ad interim Šár said:

	The wounds caused by the counter-revolution in Hungary have gradually healed, and Hungary's socialist development has embarked on a path of comprehensive consolidation.

In his speech at the reception, Chargé d'affaires ad interim Šár first thanked the Soviet Union for its consistent assistance to Hungary. He said: The heroism and bloodshed of the Soviet Red Army soldiers enabled the Hungarian working people, under the leadership of the Hungarian working class and its party, to establish a new country in the past twelve years. After the imperialists colluded with Hungarian counter-revolutionary forces to launch a counter-revolutionary riot in Budapest on October 23, 1956, our most loyal friend, the Soviet Union, responded to the request of the workers' and peasants' revolutionary government composed of the best communists. Based on the Warsaw Pact and the spirit of proletarian internationalism, the Soviet people defended Hungary's freedom and independence, which was only twelve years old, defended our achievements in building socialism, and defended the workers' and peasants' regime, which was consolidated for the first time in our history, with their blood.

Šár added: Now, although only a few months have passed since the incident, the wounds caused by the counter-revolution in our country have gradually healed, and our country's socialist development has embarked on a path of comprehensive consolidation. We have avoided inflation, and our industry is now almost able to exert its full capacity. The vanguard of the Hungarian working people, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, already has more than 230,000 members. Our garrison troops, workers' pickets, and people's army are effectively defending the motherland and the proletariat.

Šár continued: The counter-revolutionary conspiracy, which failed due to the unity of the socialist camp, has taught the Hungarian people a historical lesson. The Hungarian people are convinced that they can only defend their national independence by relying on their most loyal friend—the most developed socialist country, the Soviet Union—and by maintaining a close alliance with the Soviet Union. The recently signed declaration of the two governments' delegations and the statement of the talks between the two parties' delegations in Moscow also prove this, proving the close unity and friendship between two completely equal socialist countries fighting for a common goal. As long as the imperialist aggressive blocs still exist, as long as there is still a threat from imperialist and counter-revolutionary forces to endanger the people's regime, as the October incident proved, we demand continued participation in the Warsaw Pact in order to defend our independence and freedom, based on patriotism that values the interests of the people.

In his speech, Chargé d'affaires ad interim Šár emphasized the development of friendship between China and Hungary. He said: On the occasion of our regaining freedom, we should also remember that, in addition to the assistance from the Soviet Union, what is of the utmost importance now and in the future is the friendly assistance given to us by the fraternal Chinese people and the government of the People's Republic of China. We are particularly grateful to the great Chinese Communist Party, which creatively inherits Marxism-Leninism and develops Marxism-Leninism in an exemplary manner throughout the world. In our difficult days, their political and economic support, the Chinese government's statement on November 1, the assistance they provided and the loans they will grant to our country, Comrade Zhou Enlai's visit to Budapest, and the instructions given regarding the historical experience of the proletarian dictatorship are all matters of great significance in the eyes of the Hungarian people. For this fraternal and comradely help, the Hungarian people express their warm gratitude to the Chinese people and their leaders. We are deeply convinced that the friendship and fraternal cooperation between our two peoples, who stand firm on the western and eastern fronts of the socialist camp, will be further consolidated and strengthened in the future, and that this friendship and cooperation will bring greater results to the two peoples.

Premier Zhou Enlai said:

	The great victory of the Hungarian people has not only defended their own socialist cause, but has also made a significant contribution to the entire socialist camp and world peace.

Premier Zhou Enlai then spoke, expressing warm and fraternal congratulations on behalf of the government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people to the government of the Hungarian People's Republic and the Hungarian people. Premier Zhou said that not long ago, the imperialists took advantage of the Hungarian people's dissatisfaction with the past leadership to launch a counterrevolutionary riot. Under the leadership of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Workers' and Peasants’ Revolutionary Government, and with the assistance of the Soviet Union, which is loyal to the principle of internationalism, the Hungarian people crushed the conspiracy of counterrevolutionary restoration. This great victory of the Hungarian people has not only defended the socialist cause of the Hungarian people, but has also made a significant contribution to the entire socialist camp and world peace.

Premier Zhou said that in January of this year, when the Hungarian people were engaged in a resolute struggle, I and the comrades of the Chinese government delegation had the opportunity to visit Hungary. The Hungarian people's firm confidence in defending the socialist cause and their spirit of overcoming difficulties left us with a very deep impression. The Hungarian Workers' and Peasants’ Revolutionary Government has made remarkable achievements in this arduous struggle. We are deeply convinced that the Hungarian people, who have a glorious revolutionary tradition, will definitely be able to overcome the current difficulties and advance the socialist cause under the leadership of the Socialist Workers' Party and the Workers' and Peasants’ Revolutionary Government, and with the support and assistance of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries.

The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Workers' and Peasants’ Revolutionary Government recently held a series of talks with the parties and governments of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and achieved complete success. These talks are of great significance for further strengthening the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and for maintaining peace in Europe and the world.

Premier Zhou finally said that we are also pleased to see that since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the fraternal friendship and cooperative relations of mutual assistance between our two peoples have been constantly consolidated and developed. The Hungarian people and the Hungarian government have given various kinds of assistance to our country's socialist construction. I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude to the Hungarian government and the Hungarian people on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people. The Chinese people, like the Hungarian people, will continue to work hard to develop the friendly and cooperative relations between our two peoples.

When Chargé d'affaires ad interim Šár and Premier Zhou Enlai finished their speeches, they, along with the guests, toasted the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, the friendship between China and Hungary, the health of the leaders of the Chinese and Hungarian parties and governments, and world peace.

    庆祝匈牙利解放十二周年
    匈牙利驻华大使馆举行酒会
    新华社4日讯　匈牙利驻华大使馆今晚在北京举行酒会，庆祝匈牙利解放十二周年。大使馆临时代办沙尔在酒会上说，匈牙利人民永远感谢社会主义各国人民在匈牙利困难的时刻所给予的援助。
    朱德副主席、周恩来总理和副总理李先念、聂荣臻，副委员长沈钧儒、彭真，最高人民法院院长董必武，外交部副部长章汉夫，中国政府各部门和各人民团体的负责人，以及各国驻华使节和外交官员等三百多人应邀出席了酒会。
    沙尔代办说：
    反革命在匈牙利造成的创伤已经逐步痊愈了，而且匈牙利社会主义发展走上了全面巩固的道路
    沙尔代办在酒会上发表的讲话中，首先感谢苏联一贯给予匈牙利的援助，他说：苏联红军战士们的英雄主义和流血牺牲使匈牙利劳动人民在匈牙利工人阶级及其政党的领导下在过去十二年中建立了一个新的国家。在帝国主义勾结匈牙利反革命势力在1956年10月23日在布达佩斯发动了反革命暴乱以后，由于我们最忠实的朋友苏联响应了由最优秀的共产党人组成的工农革命政府的请求，根据华沙条约和无产阶级国际主义精神，以苏联人民的鲜血来保卫了仅有十二年历史的匈牙利自由和独立，保卫了我们建设社会主义的成绩和我们历史上第一次巩固了的工农政权。
    沙尔又说：现在，事变过去虽然只有几个月，但是反革命在我国造成的创伤已经逐步痊愈了，而且我国社会主义发展走上了全面巩固的道路。我们避免了通货膨胀，我国工业现在已经差不多能发挥全部的能力。匈牙利劳动人民的先锋队——匈牙利社会主义工人党已经拥有二十三万多党员。我们的卫戍部队、工人纠察队和人民军正在有成效地保卫着祖国和无产阶级。
    沙尔接着说：由于社会主义阵营的团结而失败了的反革命阴谋，使匈牙利人民吸取了历史教训。匈牙利人民深信只有依靠他们最忠实的朋友——最发达的社会主义国家苏联和与苏联的密切联盟，才能保卫他们的民族独立。最近在莫斯科签署的两国政府代表团宣言和两党代表团会谈声明也证明了这一点，证明两个完全平等的、为共同目的而斗争的社会主义国家之间的亲密团结和友谊。只要帝国主义侵略集团还存在，只要还有帝国主义和反革命势力危害人民政权的威胁，正如十月事件所证明出来的那样，为了保卫我国的独立和自由，我们要求在重视人民利益的爱国主义基础上继续参加华沙条约。
    沙尔代办在他的讲话中强调发展中匈两国的友谊，他说：在我们重新取得自由的节日，我们也应该记住，除了苏联给我们的援助，现在和将来具有最重要的意义的是兄弟般的中国人民和中华人民共和国政府给我们的友好援助。我们特别感谢伟大的中国共产党，这个党创造性地继承着马克思列宁主义，并且在全世界模范地发展了马克思列宁主义。在我国困难的日子里，他们给予我们政治经济方面的支持、中国政府11月1日的声明、他们提供的援助和将要给予我国的贷款、周恩来同志到布达佩斯的访问以及有关无产阶级专政的历史经验方面所给予的指示，在匈牙利人民看来，这些都是具有巨大意义的事情。为了这些兄弟般和同志般的帮助，匈牙利人民向中国人民和他们的领袖表示热烈的感谢。我们深信坚守在社会主义阵营的西部前线和东部前线的我们两国人民间的友谊和兄弟般的合作今后将更加巩固和密切，而这种友谊和合作将为两国人民带来更大的成果。
    周恩来总理说：
    匈牙利人民的伟大胜利，不仅捍卫了自己的社会主义事业，而且对整个社会主义阵营和世界和平作出了重大的贡献
    周恩来总理接着讲话，他代表中华人民共和国政府和中国人民向匈牙利人民共和国政府和匈牙利人民表示热烈的、兄弟的祝贺。周总理说，不久以前，帝国主义利用匈牙利人民对过去的领导的不满发动了反革命的暴乱。匈牙利人民在社会主义工人党和工农革命政府的领导下，在忠实于国际主义原则的苏联的援助下，粉碎了反革命复辟的阴谋。匈牙利人民的这一伟大胜利，不仅捍卫了匈牙利人民的社会主义事业，而且对整个社会主义阵营和世界和平作出了重大的贡献。
    周总理说，今年1月，当匈牙利人民正在进行坚决斗争的时候，我和中国政府代表团的同志们曾经有机会到匈牙利去访问。匈牙利人民保卫社会主义事业的坚定信心和克服困难的精神，给我们留下了十分深刻的印象。匈牙利工农革命政府在这个艰巨的斗争中已经取得了显著的成就。我们深信，具有光荣革命传统的匈牙利人民，在社会主义工人党和工农革命政府的领导下，在苏联和其他社会主义国家的支持和援助下，一定能够克服当前的困难，把社会主义事业推向前进。
    匈牙利社会主义工人党和工农革命政府最近同苏联和其他社会主义国家的党和政府举行了一系列的会谈，并且获得圆满的成功。这些会谈，对于进一步加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结、对于维护欧洲和世界和平，都具有重大的意义。
    周总理最后说，我们也高兴地看到，自从中华人民共和国成立以来，我们两国人民的兄弟友谊和互助合作关系不断地得到巩固和发展。匈牙利人民和匈牙利政府对于我国的社会主义建设给予了多方面的援助，我愿意趁这个机会，代表中国政府和中国人民向匈牙利政府和匈牙利人民表示衷心的感谢。中国人民同匈牙利人民一样将继续为发展我们两国人民的友好合作关系而努力。
    沙尔代办和周恩来总理讲话结束的时候，都同来宾们一起为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，为中匈两国的友谊，为中匈两国党和政府领导人的健康，为世界和平干杯。
