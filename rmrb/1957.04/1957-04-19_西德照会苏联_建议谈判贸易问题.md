Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, 18th - The West German government issued a general note to the Soviet government on the 17th. The note suggests that the two governments begin negotiations on trade relations between the two countries and the repatriation of Germans in the Soviet Union. On the same day, the West German government also published Adenauer's reply to Bulganin. In this letter, Adenauer continued to deny the existence of two Germanys, and he also rejected Bulganin's criticism of Brentano's remarks as unfavorable to relations between the two countries.

The note stated that the West German government suggested that the two governments hold negotiations in Moscow on the issue of trade relations between the two countries and the repatriation of German citizens in the Soviet Union, and that it was prepared to immediately send a trade delegation headed by an ambassador plenipotentiary to Moscow. The West German government also suggested that the two governments negotiate the development of consular relations between the two countries and the privileges of consuls that may be appointed by the two countries in the future.

Adenauer's letter was a response to a letter from Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Bulganin to him on March 18. Adenauer stated in the letter that he "regretted" that Bulganin had not mentioned the issue of repatriating Germans.

    西德照会苏联
    建议谈判贸易问题
    据新华社18日讯　波恩消息：西德政府17日发表了它给苏联政府的一件普通照会。照会中建议两国政府就两国间的贸易关系问题和苏联境内德国人的遣返问题开始谈判。西德政府在同一天还发表了阿登纳给布尔加宁的复信。阿登纳在这封信里继续否认两个德国存在的事实，他还拒绝了布尔加宁对勃伦塔诺的不利于两国关系的言论的指责。
    照会说，西德政府建议两国政府就两国贸易关系问题和遣返在苏联的德国公民的问题在莫斯科进行谈判，并且准备立即派遣由一位全权大使所率领的贸易代表团到莫斯科去。西德政府还建议两国政府谈判两国之间领事关系的发展以及今后两国可能任命的领事的特权问题。
    阿登纳的信是对苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁3月18日给他的一封信的回答。阿登纳在信里对于布尔加宁没有谈到遣返德国人的问题“表示遗憾”。
