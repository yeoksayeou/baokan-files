According to Xinhua News Agency: In March of this year, the Chinese Academy of Sciences Paleozoological Expedition Team discovered a second "Gigantopithecus" mandible and some scattered "Gigantopithecus" teeth in Guangxi. This mandible is even larger than the first mandible discovered last year, and a portion of teeth are well preserved on it. Paleozoologist Pei Wenzhong believes this is a mandible of a young male "Gigantopithecus"; the other scattered teeth may belong to two or three "Gigantopithecus". From these materials, it can be estimated that at least four or five "Gigantopithecus" of different ages and sexes once lived in the nitrate cave of Lengzhai Mountain, Liucheng County, Guangxi Province, where "Gigantopithecus" mandibles and teeth have been excavated twice.

    广西柳城楞寨山又发现“巨猿”下颚骨
    据新华社讯　今年3月，中国科学院古脊椎动物考察队在广西发现了第二枚“巨猿”下颚骨和一些零星的“巨猿”牙齿。这枚下颚骨比去年发现的第一枚下颚骨还要大，上面完好地保存着一部分牙齿。古脊椎动物学家裴文中认为这是一块雄性青年“巨猿”的下颚骨；其他零星的牙齿可能属于两三个“巨猿”。从这些材料，可以估计两度发掘出“巨猿”下颚骨和牙齿的广西省柳城县楞寨山的硝岩洞中，曾经有至少四、五个不同年齿和性别的“巨猿”居住过。
