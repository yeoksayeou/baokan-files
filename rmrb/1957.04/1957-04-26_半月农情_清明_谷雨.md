Bi-Weekly Agricultural Situation
    Qingming - Grain Rain

From "Qingming" (April 5th) to "Grain Rain" (20th), the countryside becomes busier day by day. During this period, farmers in the provinces south of the Yangtze River are transplanting rice seedlings and sowing seeds; along the Yellow River and Huai River and on the North China Plain, they are busy topdressing and watering winter wheat; in the Northeast and Northwest regions, they are sowing spring wheat; and in several major cotton-producing areas, they are planting cotton. The farmers' intense labor has already filled the vast fields of the motherland with new greenery, not long after the end of winter.

How is the rice transplanting work progressing in the South?

Guangdong Province has the earliest season in the country. While other parts of Guangdong are still preparing for spring plowing, farmers on Hainan Island and the Leizhou Peninsula completed transplanting rice seedlings before "Qingming." Now, the entire province of Guangdong has entered the busy season for rice transplanting.

In Guangxi Province, the counties of the Rongxian Special District on the right bank of the Xijiang River in the southeast, and the areas near the Munanguan Pass in the southwest, began transplanting rice seedlings in late March and completed the work successively in mid-April. Baise in the west and Guilin and Pingle in the northeast are transplanting rice seedlings.

Hunan Province has generally started transplanting rice seedlings, beginning along the Xiangjiang River and in the lake areas. Some agricultural cooperatives that grow three crops of rice a year, such as Jiahe and Jianghua Yao Autonomous County, transplanted early rice seedlings soon after "Qingming."

This spring, Fujian has been cold and rainy, and the early rice seedlings in southern and western Fujian have grown slowly. Only Longxi and Haicheng counties near Xiamen transplanted rice seedlings earlier.

The early rice sowing work in Jiangsu and Hubei is largely completed. A few places in Sichuan and Yunnan have already started transplanting rice seedlings.

Based on last year's experience, appropriately expanding the planting area of double-cropping rice in areas with suitable conditions is a good way to strive for a bumper harvest. According to statistics, the planting area of double-cropping rice this year is over 110 million mu, an increase of more than 9 million mu compared to last year. For example, Sichuan Province plans to plant 12 million mu, an increase of 267% over last year's planting area. However, some areas have appropriately reduced the planting area of double-cropping rice this year.

This year, all regions have paid attention to advanced technologies such as seizing the season, cultivating strong seedlings, rational close planting, and rational fertilization. For example, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Hunan and other provinces are continuing to promote rational close planting of rice.

However, judging from the current situation, many places have some difficulties: a small number of areas have already experienced spring drought. In Hunan Province, the drought-affected area in the Changde Special District accounts for about 20% of the total cultivated land; in the Xiangtan Special District, about 15% of the total area has dehydrated fields. In Guangxi Province, the temperature is low this spring, and the early rice sowing is generally delayed compared to previous years. Therefore, the seedling raising time is insufficient, and the seedlings are growing poorly. In addition, the original planting plan was too low, and the amount of sowing was insufficient. After the planting area plan was revised and expanded, there were even fewer seedlings available. Therefore, these areas must pay attention to strengthening seedling field management, cultivating strong seedlings, or carrying out replanting.

Winter wheat is jointing and booting

This year, the growth of winter wheat in various regions is generally delayed by ten days to half a month, because the spring cold has been longer. Now, winter wheat in many areas is jointing and booting. Henan Province, where wheat is the main food crop, had topdressed and watered 60% of its wheat fields by the 6th. Xuchang Special District is an important wheat-producing area in the province. Due to sufficient fertilizer, rainfall, and good management, the wheat seedlings in the entire special district have grown into a green sea that cannot be seen to the edge.

In Chang'an wheat fields, Shaanxi, wheat seedlings have more tillers after two topdressings. Wheat in some areas has begun to head. On the Loess Plateau, such as in Gaoling County, wheat has already been fertilized twice and is now undergoing a second spring irrigation.

However, wheat spider mites and wheat midges have been found in many wheat fields in southern Shaanxi and the Guanzhong area. The local authorities have notified all agricultural cooperatives to actively eliminate them.

Spring wheat is being sown

Once the season passes "Qingming," northern and northwestern China gradually warm up. Therefore, spring sowing has begun successively in this large area.

Now, in Xinjiang, spring sowing is in full swing in the fields between the Kunlun Mountains in the south and the Altai Mountains in the north. Spring wheat sowing in Hotan, Aksu and other places has ended.

The Yellow River bend area of ​​Inner Mongolia ended spring wheat sowing as early as the beginning of the month.

Heilongjiang Province in the Northeast region started sowing earlier. In the northernmost Heihe Special District of this province, farmers began sowing before the ice and snow had completely melted. Because of last year's autumn rain and the ground freezing, and the heavy snow this spring, the land is muddy, so the sowing time is delayed by about ten days compared to previous years.

Jilin and Liaoning provinces are seizing the time to prepare for spring plowing; only a very few counties have started sowing.

Gansu Province and Qinghai Province have had particularly little rain and snow last winter and this spring, and some areas have experienced severe drought. At present, about one million mu of cultivated land in Gansu Province cannot be sown, and three million mu, although sown by seizing the moisture, have difficulty emerging. Many places are mobilizing the masses to check seedlings and replant, and water the seedlings. Spring wheat in the Yinchuan Special District has emerged more than one inch high, and field management is now being strengthened.

Seizing the moisture to plant cotton

On April 9th and 10th, rain and snow fell widely in various regions. This is the right time to sow cotton. The main cotton-producing areas of Hebei Province seized the moisture to plant quickly, and the progress was very fast. From April 9th to 15th, the Xingtai Special District planted cotton on 150,000 mu of land that was prone to moisture loss. Counties such as Shahe, Neiqiu, Lincheng, Baixiang, and Xingtai have basically completed their sowing tasks. On the 11th and 12th, more than 30,000 people were mobilized in Handan County to plant more than 60,000 mu. After sowing, these places also organized forces to check the quality of sowing.

The Liaocheng Special District of Shandong started sowing earlier this year. As of the 14th, more than 200,000 mu had been sown in the entire special district. The sowing quality is also better than in previous years.

Henan and Hubei are also sowing cotton, and many counties have basically completed sowing before the Grain Rain solar term. This year, Hubei will use the Liangzhong Daizi cotton on 7 million mu of cotton fields, an increase of 2 million mu compared to last year.

As of the 16th, 80% of the cotton fields in most areas of Guanzhong, Shaanxi, had been sown.

As of the 14th, 2 million mu of cotton fields in the Jinnan Special District of Shanxi had been sown.

The cotton planting work in the Manas River Basin reclamation area of ​​Xinjiang has been prepared, and sowing will be carried out when the ground temperature rises further. After the spring wheat sowing has just ended, Kashgar, Aksu and Korla in western Xinjiang have begun planting cotton.

This year, due to insufficient livestock power and other reasons in some places, there has been a phenomenon of reducing cotton fields and delaying sowing. Shandong Dazhong Daily and Henan Daily published comments during this period, urging all regions to sow in time according to the national plan.

    半月农情
    清明——谷雨
    从“清明”（4月5日）到“谷雨”（20日）这半月，农村里一天忙似一天。这个期间，长江以南各省的农民正在插秧、下种；黄河和淮河两岸以及华北平原上正在忙着给冬小麦追肥、浇水；东北和西北地区正在种春小麦；几个主要棉产区正在种棉花。农民们的紧张劳动，已经使得祖国辽阔的田野在冬天过去不久，就染满了新绿。 
    南方插秧工作进行得怎样？
    广东省的季节在全国是最早的了。但还在广东其他地方在准备春耕的时候，海南岛和雷州半岛上的农民即在“清明”前插完了秧。现在，广东全省也进入插秧大忙阶段。
    广西省东南部西江右岸容县专区各县，和西南部接近睦南关地区，在3月下旬即开始插秧，4月中旬即陆续插完。西部的百色和东北部的桂林、平乐等地，正在插秧。
    湖南全省从湘江沿岸和滨湖地区开始，已普遍在插秧。嘉禾和江华瑶族自治县等一些种植三季稻的农业社，“清明”刚过，即插下了早稻秧。
    今春福建天寒雨多，闽南闽西的早稻秧都生长得慢，只有厦门附近的龙溪、海澄等县插秧较早。
    江苏、湖北的早稻播种工作大体结束。四川、云南有少数地方已在插秧。
    根据去年的经验，在有条件的地区适当扩大双季稻的种植面积，是争取大丰收的一个好办法。据统计，今年双季稻种植面积共有一亿一千多万亩，已比去年增加九百多万亩。如四川省就计划种植一千二百万亩，比去年种植面积增大了267％。但是，也有一些地区，今年适当地缩小了双季稻的种植面积。
    今年各地注意了争取季节、培育壮秧、合理密植、合理施肥等先进技术。如广东、浙江、湖南等省都在继续推广水稻合理密植。
    不过，就目前的情况看来，许多地方都有一些困难：有小部地区已经发生了春旱现象。湖南省常德专区受旱面积已占总田亩的20％左右；湘潭专区八个县脱水的田约占总面积的15％。广西省今春气温低，早稻播种一般比往年推迟，因此，育秧时间不够，秧苗生长不良。加上原来种植计划偏低，播种量不足，经修改扩大种植面积计划后，秧苗更不够用。所以，这些地区对于加强秧田管理，培育壮秧或进行补播，还是必须注意的。
    冬小麦拔节孕穗了
    今年各地冬小麦的生长情况，一般比往年延迟十天到半月，这是因为春寒较长。现在，许多地区的冬小麦正在拔节孕穗。以小麦为主要粮食作物的河南省，到6日，60％的麦田都增施了追肥，浇过水。许昌专区是这省重要小麦产地。由于肥料、雨水充足和管理得好，全专区麦苗已长成一眼看不到边的绿海。
    陕西长安麦田，经过两遍追肥，麦苗分蘖增多。有些地区的小麦已开始抽穗。在黄土高原上，如高陵县等地，小麦已经施了二次肥，现正在进行二次春灌。
    但是，陕西省南部和关中地区，已经在很多麦田里发现麦蜘蛛和吸浆虫。当地已通知各农业社积极消灭。
    春小麦正在播种
    季节一过“清明”，我国北部和西北部也逐渐暖和。因此，这一大片地区上便陆续开始了春播。
    现在，在新疆，南起昆仑山，北至阿尔泰山之间的田野上，春播很紧张。和阗、阿克苏等地春麦播种已经结束。
    内蒙古黄河河套一带早在月初即结束了春麦播种。
    东北地区黑龙江省下种较早。这省最北方的黑河专区冰雪还未全部融化，农民便开始下种。这省因为去年秋雨封地，今春雪大，土地泥泞，以致播种时间比往年推迟了十天左右。
    吉林、辽宁等省正在抓紧作春耕准备；只有极少数县开始下种。
    甘肃省、青海省去冬和今春雨雪特别稀少，有些地区已经出现严重旱象。现在甘肃省约有一百万亩耕地无法下种，有三百万亩虽然抢墒种下，但是出苗困难。许多地方正发动群众查苗补种，浇水泡苗。银川专区的春小麦已出土一寸多高，现在正加强田间管理。
    趁墒抢种棉花
    4月9、10两日，各地普下雨雪。这个时候，正该播种棉花。河北省的主要棉区趁墒抢种，进度很快。邢台专区9—15日，使十五万亩易跑墒地种上了棉花。沙河、内丘、临城、柏乡、邢台等县都基本上完成了播种任务。11、12日，邯郸县全县出动三万多人，抢种了六万多亩。这些地方下种之后，又组织力量互相检查播种的质量。
    山东的聊城专区今年下种较早，截至14日，全专区已播种二十多万亩。播种质量也比往年好。
    河南、湖北也正在播种棉花，不少县在谷雨节前已经基本上播种完毕。今年湖北将有七百万亩棉田采用良种岱字棉，比去年增加了二百万亩。
    陕西关中大部分地区，到16日止，80％的棉田已经下种。
    山西晋南专区截至14日，已有二百万亩棉田下种。
    新疆玛纳斯河流域垦区，植棉工作已作好准备，等到地温再上升一些即行下种。新疆西部喀什、阿克苏和库尔勒等地，在刚结束春麦播种之后，已开始种棉花。
    今年，有些地方由于畜力不足和其他一些原因，有缩减棉田和推迟下种的现象。山东大众日报和河南日报都曾在这个期间发表评论，要求各地按照国家计划及时下种。
