Xinhua News Agency, Washington, April 11th: The United States State Department, in a note to Canada on April 10th, shirked responsibility for driving Canadian Ambassador to Egypt, Norman, to his death. The note stated that the U.S. executive authorities have "no legal power to intervene" with Congressional committees.

The U.S. government's note was in response to a protest note submitted by the Canadian government to the United States on March 18th regarding the Norman case. The note declared that Canada "protested in the strongest terms" the U.S. Senate Internal Security Subcommittee's slander against Norman. It stated that the subcommittee's actions "are astonishing" and "are an action inconsistent with the long-standing and friendly cooperation that characterizes the relationship between our two countries."

    美国推诿逼死诺曼的责任
    新华社11日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院4月10日在给加拿大的一份照会中推诿逼死加拿大驻埃及大使诺曼的责任，照会说，美国行政当局对国会委员会“没有法律权力可以过问”。
    美国政府的照会是答复加拿大政府3月18日就诺曼案向美国提出的一个抗议照会的，这个照会声明加拿大对美国参议院国内安全小组委员会对诺曼的诽谤“以最强硬的措词表示抗议”。它说，小组委员会的行动“是令人吃惊的”，“是一种同标志我们两国关系特色的长久而友好的合作相抵触的行动”。
