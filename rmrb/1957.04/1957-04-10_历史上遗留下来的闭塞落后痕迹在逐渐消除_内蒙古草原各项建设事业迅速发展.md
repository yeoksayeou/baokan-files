Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot Telegram: Various construction undertakings in the grasslands of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are rapidly developing, and the vestiges of backwardness and isolation left over from history are gradually being eliminated.

Soon after the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in 1947, basic construction for livestock production began. Fine-wool sheep from Xinjiang, Caucasian sheep and Akhal-Teke and Don horses from the Soviet Union, and other fine breeds of livestock were successively transported to the grasslands. Many pastoral areas established breeding stations to carry out livestock breed improvement work. On the more than 10,000 square kilometers of pasture that has been surveyed, herdsmen have dug more than 4,000 water wells, providing clean drinking water for hundreds of thousands of livestock. The Hui River pastoral water project in Hulunbuir League has been completed, and mechanical water supply stations and pastoral water projects are being built in the Xilingol and Zhaowuda grasslands. Weather stations and meteorological observatories, which did not exist in the past, have been established on the grasslands. The thirty-nine state-owned farms on the grasslands raise 110,000 head of improved foreign breeds and local livestock, and use tractors and agricultural machinery to develop large areas of feed bases.

In the basic construction of animal husbandry, herdsmen of all ethnic groups have received support from the state. In the past eight years, the state has allocated loans equivalent to 140,000 taels of gold to help pastoral areas increase disaster prevention and livestock protection equipment, and provide herdsmen with a batch of new production tools such as horse-drawn mowers, rakes, snowplows, waterwheels, and milk separators. Since last year, with state loans and the help of Han farmers, herdsmen have begun a career that their predecessors had never done: opening up more than 10,000 hectares of feed bases for animal husbandry. After the Autonomous Region Party Committee and the government advocated the integration of agriculture and animal husbandry and carried out diversified operations, grain and vegetable farms also began to be established in pastoral areas. Many pastoral cooperatives and mutual aid groups have also begun to build permanent houses and plant vegetables and fruit trees. In emerging towns such as Xilinhot, near the grasslands, nurseries and forestry stations have been established, creating more than 8,000 hectares of trees.

Cars running on the main traffic arteries of the grasslands have replaced the slow-moving camels. To date, more than 6,000 kilometers of roads have been newly built and repaired in pastoral areas, an increase of one and a half times compared with the mileage of roads opened to traffic in 1950. Since the opening of the Jining-Erenhot railway, which runs through the central pastoral area of the autonomous region, a large number of livestock and animal products such as wool and hides have been continuously transported out of the pastoral area, and various supplies have been transported in from various places.

The construction of telegraph and telephone facilities has shortened the distance between the grasslands of the autonomous region and all parts of the country. At present, all pastoral areas in the autonomous region have been equipped with wired or wireless communication equipment. The postal route network in various pastoral areas has also been basically formed, and postal services have been opened in banners, sums (districts), and some bagas (villages).

The development of the transportation industry has enlivened the economic and cultural life of the pastoral areas. Trading companies, department stores, and supply and marketing cooperatives have been established in grassland towns and all pastoral areas. Herdsmen take trains and cars to send their children to school. At present, the number of primary schools in pastoral areas has increased to 237, more than three times before liberation. The number of herdsmen's children entering middle schools, vocational schools, and universities is also increasing year by year. Cultural troupes and film projection teams from various leagues often go deep into the pastures to carry out activities.

Since the first small milk processing plant in the autonomous region appeared in the Hulunbuir grasslands, 42 mechanized and semi-mechanized dairy factories have been built on the grasslands in the past seven years. Power plants, coal mines, tanneries, fur processing plants, animal husbandry machinery plants, and grain and food processing plants on the grasslands have also been established one after another.

    历史上遗留下来的闭塞落后痕迹在逐渐消除
    内蒙古草原各项建设事业迅速发展
    据新华社呼和浩特电　内蒙古自治区草原上各项建设事业迅速发展，历史上遗留下来的闭塞落后痕迹正在逐渐消除。
    内蒙古自治区在1947年成立以后不久，就开始了畜牧业生产的基本建设。新疆细毛羊、苏联高加索羊、阿哈马、顿河马等优良种牲畜陆续运进草原，许多牧区建立了配种站，展开牲畜品种改良工作。在已经勘查完毕的一万多平方公里牧场上，牧民们打出四千多眼水井，让几十万头牲畜得到清洁的饮水。呼伦贝尔盟辉河牧业用水工程已经建成，锡林郭勒和昭乌达草原也正在分别兴建机械供水站和牧业用水工程。从前没有的气象台和气象站，已经在草原上建立起来。草原上的三十九座国营牧场，饲养着十一万头外来良种牲畜和本地种牲畜，并使用拖拉机和农业机器开辟大片饲料基地。
    在畜牧业基本建设中，各族牧民得到了国家的支持。过去八年中，国家拨出相当于十四万两黄金的贷款，帮助牧区增加了防灾保畜设备，并使牧民们有了一批马拉打草机、搂草机、破雪器、水车和牛奶分离机等新式生产工具。从去年开始，牧民们在国家贷款和汉族农民的帮助下，开始了一件他们前人没有做过的事业：为畜牧业开辟一万多公顷的饲料基地。自治区党委和政府提倡农牧结合，开展多种经营后，粮食、蔬菜农场也开始在牧区举办起来。许多牧业社和互助组也开始建筑定居房屋，种植蔬菜和果木。在新兴的锡林浩特等草原，城镇附近，还建立了苗圃、林业工作站，营造了八千多公顷树木。
    奔驰在草原主要交通要道上的汽车，代替了慢悠悠的骆驼。到目前为止，牧区新建和修复了六千多公里公路，比1950年通车的公路里程增加一倍半。纵贯自治区中部牧区的集宁一二连铁路通车以来，源源地把牧区大量牲畜和绒毛、皮张等畜产品运出去，又从各地运来了各种物资。
    电报和电话方面的建设，缩短了自治区草原同全国各地的距离。现在，自治区所有牧区都已架设有线或无线电讯设备。各牧区的邮路网也已经基本形成，旗、苏木（区）和部分巴嘎（村）都已通邮。
    交通运输业的发展，活跃了牧区的经济和文化生活。贸易公司、百货商店和供销合作社已在草原城镇和所有牧区分别建立起来。牧民们坐着火车、汽车，把自己的子弟送进学校里去。现在，牧区小学校已经发展到二百三十七所，比解放前增加两倍多。升入中学、专业学校和高等学校的牧民子弟也在逐年增加。各盟文化队和电影放映队，经常深入牧场展开活动。
    自从呼伦贝尔草原出现自治区第一座小型牛奶加工厂之后，七年来草原上已经兴建起四十二座机械化和半机械化的乳品工厂。草原上的发电厂、煤矿、制革厂、皮毛加工厂、畜牧业机械厂和粮食、食品加工厂，也已经纷纷建立起来。
