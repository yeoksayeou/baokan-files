Xinhua News Agency, April 5th: In order to help agricultural cooperatives and farmers solve the difficulties in spring plowing and production, and in their livelihoods, the Ministry of Food has decided to continue issuing 635 million yuan in advance payments for grain and oil crop purchases.

This batch of advance payments will be issued to agricultural cooperatives or farmers who have grain or oil crop sales tasks this year. It will be based on the "three fixed" grain purchase figures and last year's pre-purchase figures for oil crops, combined with this year's grain and oil crop production increase plans, and appropriately allocated and used according to the production needs of the cooperative and the economic difficulties of the members. Cooperatives or households severely affected by disasters can receive a larger proportion of the advance payment. In its instructions to various regions, the Ministry of Food specifically emphasized that this must be strictly distinguished from disaster relief funds; the phenomenon of overdue payments must be resolutely eliminated, so as to avoid state losses and affect the issuance of advance payments in the coming year.

    粮食部预付粮食油料价款六亿多元
    据新华社5日讯　粮食部为了帮助农业社和农民解决春耕生产上和生活上的困难，决定继续发放六亿三千五百多万元的购粮和购油料的预付价款。
    这批预付价款将发给今年有粮食或油料交售任务的农业社或农户，根据“三定”的购粮数字和去年油料的预购数字为基础，结合今年粮食、油料的增产计划，并根据社的生产需要和社员经济困难情况，恰当地分配使用。受灾严重的社或户可得到比例较大的预付款。粮食部在发给各地指示中，还特别强调指出：这必须同救灾款严格划分清楚；坚决消除拖欠价款的现象，以免造成国家损失和影响来年预付价款的发放。
