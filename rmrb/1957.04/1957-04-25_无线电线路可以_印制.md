Wireless circuits can be "printed."
    Open a radio, and you see a dense network of wires, small parts, etc., on the bottom board, like a spider web. This complex and delicate soldering work must be done by hand. Now, some technologically advanced countries are gradually phasing out this manual method and using printed wireless circuits instead. Several young people at the China Radio Technology Research Institute also started this research last year. Now they have achieved good results. This method involves printing metal on a non-conductive substrate (either hard or soft) to replace the many wires that currently occupy space. In this way, a special printing machine can be used to print metal circuits onto the radio's bottom board like printing cloth and books. China does not yet have this printing equipment. During the experiment, the researchers found a way to print circuits without complex tools, and the result was satisfactory. Now they have mastered several methods of printing circuits in the laboratory. They are also conducting research on printing radio switches. They used self-designed and trial-produced printed circuit boards to assemble and modify three radios. When reporters interviewed them on the 22nd, one of them was clearly playing songs. Printed circuits can also be used in many other electronic devices, such as televisions, electronic computers, radar, missiles, etc. It has many advantages: unlike manual soldering, it does not require a lot of manpower and time, and it is not easy to make mistakes. Printed circuits can be industrialized, and it is estimated that it can increase productivity by about three times; it can withstand vibration, high temperatures, and humidity, reduce volume, and reduce weight, so it is especially suitable for small and ultra-small wireless equipment; it is especially beneficial to the aviation industry. Countries all over the world attach great importance to the research and production of printed circuits. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    无线电线路可以“印制”
    打开收音机，但见底版下面的电线、小零件等等攀得密密麻麻，像蛛网一样。这种繁复细致的焊接工作一定要靠手艺来完成。现在有些技术先进的国家已经在逐步淘汰这种手工办法，改用印制无线电线路的办法。我国无线电技术研究所的几个青年人，也在去年开始了这项研究。现在已有很好的成绩。这个方法是把金属印在一块不导电的底版上（硬的软的都可以），代替目前所用的占据着空间的许多电线。这样就可以用一种特制的印刷机器像印花布和印书那样把金属的线路印到收音机的底版上去。我国还没有这种印制设备。研究所的科学工作者在实验时找出了一种不需要复杂工具的办法来印制线路，结果是满意的。现在他们已掌握了实验室内印制线路的几种方法。并且正进行着印制无线电开关的研究。他们用自己设计试制的印制线路的底版装配和改装了三架收音机。22日记者采访的时候，其中一架正在清晰地播放着歌曲。印制线路同样可以用在其他许多电子设备中，如电视机、电子计算机、雷达、导弹等。它的优点很多：不像手工焊接那样花费人力和时间以及容易接错，印制线路可以工厂化，估计可提高生产率约三倍；可以耐震动，耐高温，防潮湿，缩小体积，减轻体重，因此特别适用于小型和超小型的无线电设备；对于航空事业尤其有好处。世界各国都很重视印制线路的研究和生产。　（据新华社讯）
