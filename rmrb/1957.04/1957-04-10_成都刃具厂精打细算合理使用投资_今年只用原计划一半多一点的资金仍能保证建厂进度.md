The Chengdu Cutting Tool Plant, which began construction in May of last year, broke the so-called regular construction procedures common in general factory and mining construction of "welfare first, production second; auxiliary buildings first, main production workshops second." It boldly adopted the method of "production first, welfare second; main production workshops first, general auxiliary buildings second." Even with the significant reduction in capital construction investment this year, the plant's main workshops can still be basically completed and put into production this year.

This year, the Chengdu Cutting Tool Plant's capital construction investment was reduced by the state by 42.3%. Therefore, completing the construction tasks according to the original plan was difficult. The factory's leadership, based on the principles of running enterprises diligently and thriftily and "spending less money and doing more things," organized personnel from all aspects. They carefully calculated, repeatedly researched, and decided to ensure the completion of major production projects. For non-productive or less important projects, they would postpone or cancel them as much as possible. For example, they completely eliminated the emulsified oil manufacturing plant, garage, fire station, canteen, office building, surrounding walls, and main gate which had not yet begun construction, as well as the air conditioning system, heating, elevators, and cranes in the gauge factory building, from this year's plan. They also largely reduced investment in ventilation for each factory building, as well as factory area roads and lighting. They will also no longer build new dormitories this year, only some simple thatched houses. Regarding equipment, which is where most of the money is spent, the factory also tried to reduce the number of the same types of equipment as much as possible based on the characteristics that this year is not for mass production and the urgency of production needs, and tried to replace foreign equipment with domestic equipment. By adopting these measures, they can use a little more than half of the originally planned investment to ensure that the main workshops are basically completed within this year. Except for the drill bit workshop, the remaining twelve workshops can be put into production this year. They strive to master the production technology of one hundred and ten representative specifications of products this year, and expand the specifications to seventy-two types, striving to complete a total output value of 3.1 million yuan. According to the factory's estimates, provided that investment continues to be guaranteed, this factory may reach the design requirements by March 1959, with an annual total output value of nearly 70 million yuan. If the profit turned over to the state is calculated at 30%, all investment can be recovered in about two years.

When determining the construction procedure of "production first, welfare second; main production workshops first, general auxiliary buildings second," the factory encountered opposition from some people inside and outside the factory. For example, some people accused this practice of violating the usual regular factory construction procedures, believing that if welfare projects are placed at the end, production workers and construction workers will not have houses to live in. Building temporary thatched houses will not last long, and re-building permanent buildings later will cause waste. The factory emphasized, based on the country's urgent need for tools, especially gauges: building workshops first allows for early start of production and accelerates the effectiveness of investment; Sichuan has a warm climate, and living in thatched houses will not affect the health of employees; after the entire factory is put into production, formal office, dining, and accommodation rooms can still be gradually built; in the future, thatched houses can also be used as children's schools, employee spare-time schools, or continue to be used as dormitories, and will not be wasted.

Now, among the four main production workshops and thirteen production workshops of the Chengdu Cutting Tool Plant, three workshops including tool repair, cutting tool, and woodworking, and five workshops including tool, machine repair, electrical repair, forging, and milling cutter, have successively started partial operations, and are manufacturing tools, fixtures, and special machine tools for the factory. The gauge factory building is undergoing foundation engineering construction and is scheduled to be put into production in the fourth quarter. Other facilities such as the central material warehouse, scrap metal warehouse, and flammable warehouse, as well as some dormitories, are also nearing completion. Production materials, tools, fixtures, etc., have also been preliminarily prepared.

The reporter visited the thirteen thatched houses built by the factory last year for office, dining, and accommodation purposes. With bamboo pillars, bamboo walls, paper windows, and thatched roofs, the cost per square meter was only a little more than eight yuan. Although these thatched houses are not as spacious and bright as buildings, they can still be used for office, dining, and accommodation. It is estimated that they will not collapse for eight to ten years. Now, employees are working in the thatched houses; except for employees with families who temporarily live in the city or in farmers' homes near the factory site, more than six hundred single employees live in the thatched houses.

The Chengdu Cutting Tool Plant's experience in building the factory diligently and thriftily has been praised by Vice Chairman Zhu De, who inspected work in Chengdu not long ago. The Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has printed it into a document and distributed it to various industrial and mining enterprises in the province for reference and study.

    成都刃具厂精打细算合理使用投资
    今年只用原计划一半多一点的资金仍能保证建厂进度
    本报讯　去年5月动工兴建的成都刃具厂，打破了一般厂矿建设中“先福利，后生产；先辅助性建筑，后主要生产厂房”的所谓正规建筑程序，大胆地采取了“先生产，后福利；先主要生产厂房，后一般辅助性建筑”的办法，即使在今年基本建设投资大量削减的情况下，全厂主要厂房仍然可以在今年基本建成，投入生产。
    今年，成都刃具厂的基本建设投资被国家核减了42.3％，因此要按原计划进度来完成建设任务是有困难的。这个厂的领导人员根据勤俭办企业、“少花钱，多办事”的原则，从保证原有总进度和早日投入生产、早日发挥投资效果的要求出发，组织各方面人员，精打细算，反复研究，决定要保证完成主要生产项目；对于非生产性的或者次要的项目，就尽可能缓办或不办。例如，他们把还没有施工的乳化液制造厂、汽车库、消防所、食堂、办公楼、围墙、大门，量具厂房内的空气调节系统、采暖、升降机、吊车等项目，从今年计划内全部削掉；把各厂房的通风及厂区道路、照明的投资，大部加以削减；今年还不再另盖宿舍，只建一些简单的草房。在花钱最多的设备方面，厂里也根据今年不是大批生产的特点和生产需要的缓急，在保证今年生产需要的基础上，尽量减少同类型的设备数量，尽量用本国设备代替外国设备。采取这些措施，可以用削减后只有原计划一半多一点的投资，保证各主要厂房在今年内基本建成。除钻头车间以外，其余十二个车间今年都可以投入生产。他们争取在今年掌握具有代表性的一百一十种规格的产品的生产技术，并扩大规格七十二种，争取完成总产值三百一十万元。据厂里估计，在投资继续保证的情况下，这个厂在1959年3月就可能达到设计要求，每年生产总值近七千万元。如上缴利润以30％计算，大约两年就可收回全部投资。
    这个厂在确定“先生产，后福利；先主要生产厂房，后一般辅助性建筑”的建筑程序时，曾经遭到厂内外一部分人的反对。如有的人指责这种做法违反了通常的正规建厂程序，认为福利工程放在后面，生产工人和建筑工人会没有房子住，修临时草房，又不能持久，以后再修永久性建筑，就会造成浪费。厂方根据国家对工具、特别是量具需要迫切的情况，强调指出：先修厂房，可以先开工生产，加速发挥投资效果；四川气候暖和，住草房，不会影响职工健康；全厂投入生产以后，正式的办公、食宿用房，还能逐步修建；将来草房也可以用作子弟学校、职工业余学校或继续作宿舍之用，不会浪费。
    现在，成都刃具厂的四个主要生产厂房、十三个生产车间中，已经有工具修理、刃具、木工等三个厂房和工具、机修、电修、锻工、铣刀等五个车间先后局部开工，正在为本厂制造工具、卡具和专用机床。量具厂房正在进行基础工程施工，计划在第四季度投入生产。其它如中央材料仓库、废金属仓库和易燃仓库以及部分宿舍，也已经接近完工。生产材料和工具、卡具等，也初步准备好了。
    记者参观了这个厂去年修建的办公、食宿用的十三幢草房，竹柱、竹壁、纸窗、茅顶，每平方公尺造价只八元多钱。这些草房虽不如楼房宽敞、明亮，但也可以办公、食宿，据估计，住八年十年也不会倒塌。现在，职工们都在草房里办公；除了带眷属的职工暂时住在城里或厂地附近农民家中以外，六百多个单身职工都住在草房里。
    成都刃具厂的勤俭建厂的经验，受到了不久前在成都视察工作的朱德副主席的称赞。中共四川省委员会已经把它印成文件，发给全省各工矿企业参考学习。　（王世晋）
