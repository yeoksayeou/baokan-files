    Qingtian stone carvings are made from stone materials unique to Qingtian County, Zhejiang Province. The stone is smooth, delicate, and brittle, and was mostly used for making seals in the past.

    Qingtian stone carving began in the late Yuan and early Ming dynasties. After a long period of creative labor by artisans, it has developed in terms of variety and carving techniques. At present, Qingtian stone carvings for appreciation include figure sculptures, landscape and flower-and-bird screen panels, and small pieces such as monkeys, pigeons, and elephants. Practical items include ashtrays and vases.

    青田石雕
    青田石雕是用浙江青田县特产的石料制作的。石质腻滑，细致而松脆，过去大都作图章用。
    青田石雕在元末明初即已开始制作，经过艺人的长期创作劳动，在品种上、雕刻技术上，都有发展。目前，青田石雕中供欣赏用的有人物雕刻、山水花鸟插屏和一些猢狲、鸽子、象等小件作品；供实用的有烟灰缸、花瓶等。
