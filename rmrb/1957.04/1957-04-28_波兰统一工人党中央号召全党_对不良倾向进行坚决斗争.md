    Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee Calls on the Entire Party
    To Resolutely Struggle Against Negative Tendencies
    The Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party recently called on the entire party to wage a resolute and uncompromising struggle against nationalism, chauvinism, and racism in Poland.

    In a letter to the entire party, the Party Central Committee stated that the party should adopt a firm attitude in its struggle to ensure full compliance with the principle of equal rights for all nationalities guaranteed by the Constitution of People's Poland. Polish citizens, regardless of nationality, race, or religious belief, have equal rights in all aspects of the country's political, economic, social, and cultural life. Any act that directly or indirectly infringes upon these rights on the grounds of nationality, race, or religious belief, thereby undermining this principle, shall be punished by law.

    The letter pointed out that all minority nationalities have the same rights to run schools in their own languages, organize cultural groups, and fully respect and develop their national cultural traditions. All Polish citizens have equal rights to participate in work and to assume positions of responsibility in all aspects of the state and society based on their professional, moral, and political qualifications. The party now and in the future will insist on combating expressions of national oppression against minority nationalities. The entire party must resolutely oppose manifestations of anti-Semitism existing in People's Poland.

    The Party Central Committee's letter emphasized the internationalist nature of the United Workers' Party and stated that there is no place in the party, nor can there be, for spreading nationalist, chauvinist, and racist viewpoints. In the ranks of the party, those who attempt to poison the party, party organizations, and party members with the venom of nationalism and anti-Semitism should not be tolerated. In this regard, particularly high demands should be placed on party members holding responsible positions in the party and the state.

    波兰统一工人党中央号召全党
    对不良倾向进行坚决斗争
    波兰统一工人党中央委员会最近号召全党对波兰国内的民族主义、沙文主义和种族主义现象进行坚决、不调和的斗争。
    党中央在一封给全党的信中说，党应该以坚决的态度进行斗争，使人民波兰的宪法所保证的各民族权利平等的原则得到充分遵守。波兰公民，不分民族、种族和宗教信仰，在国家的政治、经济、社会和文化生活多方面都有平等的权利。任何以民族、种族或宗教信仰为理由而直接或间接侵犯这些权利、从而破坏了这项原则的行为，都要受到法律的惩罚。
    这封信指出，所有少数民族在开办本民族语言的学校、组织文化团体、充分尊重和发展民族文化传统各方面，都有同样的权利。波兰全体公民都有同等权利参加工作和根据他们的专业以及道德、政治条件等担负国家、社会各方面的职务。党现在和将来都要坚持打击对少数民族施行民族压迫的表现。全党必须坚决反对在人民波兰存在的排斥犹太主义的表现。
    党中央的信强调了统一工人党的国际主义性质，并且说，在党内没有、也不可能有散播民族主义、沙文主义和种族主义观点的地盘。在党的队伍里，不应当容忍那些企图用民族主义和排犹主义的毒液来毒害党、党组织和党员的人。在这方面，对于身居党和国家负责岗位的党员们应该有特别高的要求。
