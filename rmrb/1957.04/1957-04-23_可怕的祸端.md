    A Terrible Calamity
    The British Conservative government's defense white paper, published on April 4, has caused an unusual stir in the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Many ruling figures in the United States and other countries of the group have expressed great "surprise" and have uneasily described it as a "military revolution," which will force the North Atlantic Group to "re-evaluate its plans and strategies."
    What "revolutionary" elements does the British defense white paper contain? Why does it make the United States and other countries of the North Atlantic Group so uneasy?
    According to this defense white paper, the British Conservative government has decided to reduce the British armed forces by 315,000 men over the next five years, but at the same time to concentrate on developing nuclear weapons. The British decision to cut the armed forces is a good thing in itself, but emphasizing the development of nuclear weapons at the same time turns a good thing into a bad thing. Because this approach of the British Conservative government is merely a shift from a policy of overall expansion of armaments to a policy of concentrating on expanding atomic armaments. The direction of this policy remains one of arms expansion and war preparation, and therefore it is impossible for it to play any positive role in easing international tensions.
    There are two main goals that the Conservative government is pursuing in taking this step: first, to reduce some of the burden of military expenditure in order to improve Britain's economic situation; second, to make Britain the first "nuclear power" in Western Europe in order to maintain its status as a great power. But the British gentlemen are simply mistaking illusions for reality. The policy of expanding atomic armaments is diametrically opposed to these two goals.
    In terms of reducing military expenditure, the Conservative government's defense white paper lists a military budget of only 70 million pounds less for the 1957-1958 fiscal year than the previous year. What help can this paltry 70 million pounds provide in improving Britain's economic situation? Moreover, because the Conservative government wants to continue developing nuclear weapons, its forces will have to be reorganized and equipped with atomic weapons, and atomic armaments are far more expensive than conventional armaments, which will constantly create the need to increase military expenditure. In this situation, what clever plan does the Conservative government have that can prevent its military spending from rebounding in the future?
    The Conservative government's attempt to rely on the expansion of atomic armaments to maintain Britain's faltering great power status is as difficult as trying to catch the moon in the water. Britain's resource and economic difficulties force it to beg for American assistance in expanding atomic armaments, which can only make it further subservient to the United States. The United States has promised to give Britain missiles in the Bermuda talks, but has retained control over the atomic warheads, which even British Prime Minister Macmillan admits is, in effect, a "supervisory power" over Britain's use of missiles. In other words, Britain has lost some degree of independence from the United States in military terms.
    It can be seen that the Conservative government's carefully planned intention to expand atomic armaments has nothing praiseworthy to offer to Britain itself. Moreover, this approach will trigger a mad atomic arms race. It will not only bring unbearable military expenditure burdens to all countries (including Britain), but will also put countries that pursue this policy in a very dangerous situation. While the British defense white paper strives to defend Britain's "deterrence policy," it also has to admit: "It is not yet possible to provide our country (i.e. Britain) with sufficient protection from the effects of nuclear weapons attack." In other words, countries that pursue the expansion of atomic armaments cannot avoid the fatal dangers that this policy entails.
    The United States and other countries of the North Atlantic Group are uneasy about Britain's actions, but for different reasons. The United States is mainly worried that other countries of the North Atlantic Group will have to follow Britain's example and cut their armed forces under pressure from public opinion; it is also worried that this will undermine its monopoly on nuclear weapons in the group. West Germany is "jealous" that Britain is becoming the first "nuclear power" in Western Europe, and is clamoring to equip West German forces with atomic weapons. France and other North Atlantic countries feel "dissatisfied" because Britain's actions put them in a very passive position in the face of domestic public opinion. However, the North Atlantic Group countries, including the United States, cannot help but worry about the future of the atomic arms race, apart from these considerations of their own interests. The New York Times of the United States, in an editorial commenting on the British defense white paper on April 7, pointed out helplessly that deliberately preparing for atomic war is a form of "planned suicide." The newspaper's reporter, Callender, also said in a commentary on the same issue from Paris on April 10 that some ruling figures in Western European countries are "frightened" by the strategy that they must rely on the "nuclear power" of the United States and Britain. It can be seen that some North Atlantic Group countries, including the United States, which are keen on expanding atomic armaments, are not at ease about the dangers of this policy.
    This situation shows that the "deterrence policy" and the policy of expanding atomic armaments are a terrible calamity for any country. It is time for this policy to stop. The Soviet Union has put forward a practical and feasible plan for comprehensive disarmament, which also includes provisions for the complete abolition of atomic armaments; now, as long as the United States and Britain abandon their "deterrence policy," the world will enter an era of comprehensive and lasting peaceful coexistence. And only by following this path can countries like Britain truly improve their economic situation and get rid of their humiliating position in international relations.

### 可怕的祸端

    可怕的祸端
    4月4日英国保守党政府发表的国防白皮书，已在北大西洋集团国家中引起了一阵并非寻常的喧嚷。美国和这个集团的其他国家的许多统治集团人士，都表示十分“吃惊”，并且不安地把它说成是一种“军事革命”，从而会使北大西洋集团不得不对它的“计划和战略重作估价”。
    英国的国防白皮书到底包含了一些什么“革命”的因素呢？它为什么会使美国和北大西洋集团其他国家如此不安呢？
    根据这个国防白皮书，英国保守党政府决定要在今后五年内，把英国的武装部队削减三十一万五千人，但同时要集中力量发展核武器。英国决定裁减武装部队，这本是一件好事，但是由于它同时强调发展核武器，这就把好事变成了坏事。因为英国保守党政府的这种做法，只不过是从全面扩张军备的政策，转变为集中力量扩张原子军备的政策。这种政策的方向依然是扩军备战，因而也就不可能对缓和国际局势有什么积极的作用。
    保守党政府所以走出这一步，主要追求的有两个目的：一、减轻一些军费负担，以改善英国的经济情况；二、使英国成为西欧的第一个“原子核国家”，以维持它的大国地位。但是英国的绅士们不过是把幻想当成了现实。扩张原子军备的政策，是同这两个目的南辕北辙，背道而驰的。
    以减轻军费负担来说，保守党政府的国防白皮书开列的1957—1958年度的军事预算，只比上一年度减少了七千多万英镑。这区区七千多万英镑对改善英国经济情况会有什么帮助呢？何况由于保守党政府要继续发展核武器，它的部队还要改组并配备原子武器，而原子军备远比常规军备耗费为大，这将不断产生增加军费开支的需求。在这种情况下，保守党政府有什么锦囊妙计能够使它的军费开支在今后不回升上去呢？
    保守党政府企图依靠扩张原子军备维持英国摇摇欲坠的大国地位，这正像水中捞月一样困难。英国资源和经济上的困难，使它在扩张原子军备时不能不乞求美国的援助，这样就只能使它进一步屈从于美国。美国在百慕大会谈中已答应给英国导弹，但是却保留了对原子弹头的控制权，这连英国首相麦克米伦也承认，这实际上是对英国使用导弹的一种“监督权”。换句话说，也就是英国在军事上对美国丧失了某种程度的独立。
    由此可见，保守党政府处心积虑地要扩张原子军备的打算，对英国本身没有什么可以值得称道的好处。而且，这种做法却要引起一场疯狂的原子军备竞赛。它不但要给各国（也包括英国在内）带来不可忍受的军费负担，而且还会使奉行这种政策的国家处于非常危险的境地。英国的国防白皮书中一面竭力为英国的“威慑政策”辩护，一面也不得不承认：“目前还无法给我国（即英国）人民提供足够的保护，以便不受核武器攻击的后果的影响”。换句话说，就是奉行扩张原子军备的国家，不能使自己避免这种政策所招致的致命危害。
    美国和北大西洋集团其他国家对英国的做法都感到不安，但其原因却各自不同。美国主要是担心北大西洋集团其他国家在舆论的压力下，不得不效仿英国的做法，削减武装部队；同时也担心这将损害它在这个集团中的核武器的垄断地位。西德则“妒忌”英国成为西欧的第一个“原子核国家”，因而叫嚷着要以原子武器来装备西德的部队。法国和其他北大西洋国家则因为英国的做法使它们在国内舆论面前处于十分被动的地位，而感到“不满”。但是，包括美国在内的北大西洋集团国家，除了这种本身的利害的考虑之外，它们对于原子军备竞赛的前途又都不能不有所担忧。美国纽约时报
  4月7日在评论英国国防白皮书的社论中，就曾无可奈何地指出，处心积虑地准备原子战争，是一种“有计划的自杀”。这个报纸的记者卡伦德4月10日从巴黎发出的一篇评论同一个问题的通讯中也说，西欧国家的一些统治集团人士对于他们必须指望美国和英国的“核威力”这种战略是“感到害怕”的。可见，包括热衷于扩张原子军备的美国在内的一些北大西洋集团国家，对于这种政策的危害也不是安然无忧的。
    这种情况说明，“威慑政策”和扩张原子军备政策对任何国家都是一种可怕的祸端。这种政策是到了应该停止的时候了。苏联已为全面裁减军备提出了切实可行的方案，其中也包括了彻底废止原子军备的规定；现在只要美英这些国家放弃它们的“威慑政策”，世界就会进入一个全面的、持久的和平共处的时代。而且像英国这样的国家，也只有走这条道路，才能真正改善它的经济情况，才能在国际关系中摆脱受人奚落的处境。
