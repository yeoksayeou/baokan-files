Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 3rd: Twelve military officers' family members from a certain PLA unit on the Fujian Front have joined the Haiqun Agricultural Production Cooperative in Tong'an County, their place of residence. They were commended at the first conference of military officers' family member representatives from the Fujian Front troops, which closed yesterday.

These military officers' family members requested to participate in agricultural production in November of last year. The leadership of their units consulted with the local government and introduced them to an agricultural cooperative near their residence with a shortage of labor. They actively worked in the agricultural cooperative, adhered to the cooperative's rules, and were respected by the veteran cooperative members. Wang Honghai, the wife of Deputy Company Commander Zhao Qinghua, brought her two-year-old child to work in the cooperative every day. When grinding sweet potato flour, an average cooperative member could grind 150 jin per day, but she could grind 200 jin. Lu Zhixian, the wife of Staff Officer Jiang Yongqi, was assigned to pig farming and took the lead in washing pigsties and cooking pig feed every day. In their spare time, these new cooperative members also often helped the veteran cooperative members carry grain, wash clothes, and cook meals. The veteran cooperative members also regarded them as their own relatives, giving them houses to live in and often inviting them to eat. Everyone affectionately called Lu Zhixian "the cooperative's good daughter-in-law." People also advised them, "Bring your parents here and settle down and build a career with us as permanent cooperative members." (Attached picture)

The spare-time middle school of a certain PLA unit stationed in Zhanjiang organized more than 1,200 officers to cross the sea to build a seawall for the people of Tiaodong Island. The picture shows draining water and taking soil in deep water.

    解放军某部十二名军官家属
    参加驻地农业生产
    新华社福建前线3日电　福建前线解放军某部有十二名军官家属参加了驻地同安县海群农业生产合作社。她们在昨天闭幕的福建前线部队首届军官家属代表会上受到表扬。
    这些军官家属在去年11月提出要求参加农业生产，所在部队的领导机关就与当地政府协商，把她们介绍到驻地邻近劳动力少的一个农业社去。她们在农业社中积极劳动，遵守社里的制度，受到老社员的尊敬。副连长赵清华的妻子王鸿海每天带着两岁的孩子到社里做活，在磨地瓜粉的时候，一般社员每天磨一百五十斤，她能磨二百斤。参谋蒋永棋的妻子卢芝仙，被分配作养猪工作，她每天带头洗猪栏、煮猪食。在工余的时间，这些新社员还经常帮助老社员挑谷子、洗衣服和做饭等。老社员们也把她们看成了自己的亲人，让房子给她们住，经常留她们吃饭，大家还亲昵地称卢芝仙是“社里的好媳妇”。人们还劝她们说：“把你们的父母接来吧，在我们这里安家立业，做个永久社员。”（附图片）
