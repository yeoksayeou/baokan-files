Syrian National Day

	On April 17, 1946, Syria shook off the shackles of long-term imperialist enslavement and oppression and began a new life of independence.

	Syria is located on the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, with an area of 187,000 square kilometers and a population of 3,756,000. It is an ancient country with thousands of years of history and cultural traditions. As early as 1516, Syria (including present-day Lebanon) was occupied by Turkey. Until the beginning of the 20th century, it was always part of the Ottoman Empire.

	During the First World War, Britain and France concluded a secret agreement to secretly divide the colonies in the Near and Middle East, and劃 divided Syria into the French sphere of influence. In 1918, Syria was liberated from the occupation of the German-Turkish army, and immediately occupied by the British and French troops. Since then, the League of Nations, manipulated by Britain and France, entrusted France to rule Syria. In order to weaken the increasingly high tide of the national liberation movement in Syria after the October Revolution, the French rulers adopted the method of "divide and rule" and divided Lebanon from Syria. However, the Syrian people's struggle against French rule has never stopped. France had to announce a constitution in 1930, hypocritically recognizing Syria's "independence," but in fact maintaining its mandate. When World War II broke out in 1939, France abolished the Syrian constitution.

	In the early days of World War II, France was defeated by Hitler's Germany, and Britain took the opportunity to send troops to seize France's colonies in the Middle East in 1941. Since then, France's power in the Middle East has greatly weakened, and control has gradually shifted to the hands of British imperialism. The struggle of the Soviet Union and the people of all countries against fascism promoted a new upsurge in the Syrian national liberation movement. In September 1941, General Gaudreault, commander-in-chief of the French army, was forced to declare Syria's independence in Damascus, but the regime was still in the hands of the British and French occupation forces. It was not until August 1943 that Syria established its own government and elected Shukri al-Quwatli as president. In December of the same year, representatives of France and Syria and Lebanon signed an agreement stipulating that France should transfer all the powers it exercised during its mandate to the governments of Syria and Lebanon in January 1944. However, even after the end of World War II, the British and French troops continued to occupy Syria and Lebanon. In January 1946, the governments of Syria and Lebanon submitted a memorandum to the British and French governments, requesting the immediate and complete withdrawal of British and French troops. But the British and French governments ignored it. In February of the same year, Syria and Lebanon applied to the United Nations Security Council for a resolution demanding the immediate withdrawal of British and French troops. The demands of Syria and Lebanon were firmly supported by the Soviet Union. Under the pressure of world opinion and the national liberation movements in Arab countries, the British and French troops were forced to withdraw from Syria and Lebanon in April 1946. The Syrian people's long struggle for national independence finally achieved victory. (Hu Zhen)

    叙利亚国庆日
    1946年4月17日，叙利亚摆脱了长期以来帝国主义奴役和压迫的枷锁，开始了新的独立的生活。
    叙利亚位于地中海的东岸，面积十八万七千平方公里，人口三百七十五万六千人。它是一个有着几千年历史和文化传统的古国。但远在1516年叙利亚（包括现在的黎巴嫩）就被土耳其所侵占。直到二十世纪初，它始终是奥斯曼帝国的一部分。
    第一次世界大战期间，英国和法国订立了一个秘密协定，暗中瓜分在中近东的殖民地，把叙利亚划进法国的势力范围。在1918年，叙利亚刚从德土军队占领下解放出来，立即又为英法军队所占领。此后，英法所操纵的国际联盟，委任法国统治叙利亚。法国统治者为了削弱十月革命后在叙利亚日益高涨的民族解放运动，采取了“分而治之”的办法，把黎巴嫩从叙利亚划分出来。但叙利亚人民反抗法国统治的斗争，始终没有停止过。法国不得不于1930年公布了一项宪法，伪善地承认叙利亚“独立”，但事实上还是维持着它的委任统治权。1939年第二次世界大战一开始，法国废除叙利亚的宪法。
    第二次世界大战初期，法国被希特勒德国所击败，英国于1941年乘机派兵夺取了法国在中东的殖民地。从此，法国在中东势力大衰，控制权逐渐转移到英帝国主义的手里。苏联和各国人民反对法西斯的斗争，促进了叙利亚民族解放运动的新高涨。1941年9月，法军总司令贾德鲁被迫在大马士革宣布叙利亚独立，但政权依旧掌握在英法占领军手里。只是到了1943年8月，叙利亚才成立了自己的政府，并选举舒克里·库阿特利为总统。同年12月，法国和叙黎两国代表签订了协定，规定法国应于1944年1月，将它在委任统治时期所行使的一切权力，移交给叙黎两国政府。可是，直到第二次世界大战结束后，英法军队还继续占领着叙利亚和黎巴嫩。1946年1月叙黎两国政府向英法政府提出备忘录，要求英法军队立即完全撤退。但英法两国政府置之不理。同年2月，叙黎两国申请联合国安全理事会作出决议，要英法军队立即撤退。叙黎两国的要求得到了苏联的坚决支持。在世界舆论和阿拉伯各国民族解放运动的压力下，英法军队被迫在1946年4月撤出了叙黎两国。叙利亚人民争取民族独立的长期斗争，终于取得了胜利。　　　　　　　（胡真）
