Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 22nd - The Romanian chemical industry sector, on the basis of the production increase and economy campaign launched at the beginning of this year, completed 107.6% of its production plan for the first quarter.

In the first quarter, the chemical industry sector was one of the sectors that achieved the best results in the production increase and economy campaign that was universally launched throughout Romania. In February this year, the "I. Frimu" metallurgical factory in Sinaia first proposed the slogan of a production increase and economy competition "struggle to reduce the cost of each product". Immediately afterwards, batches of industrial enterprises enthusiastically responded to this call for competition. Various units convened production meetings and formulated specific plans for increasing production and practicing economy based on their actual conditions.

The production increase and economy campaign in various industrial sectors of Romania is being carried out simultaneously with the improvement of the wage system. The improved wage system can increase workers' wages by an average of 15%.

    争取降低产品成本
    罗马尼亚企业开展增产运动
    据新华社布加勒斯特22日电  罗马尼亚的化学工业部门在今年年初展开的增产节约运动的基础上，完成了今年第一季度生产计划107.6％。
    在第一季度里，化学工业部门是在罗马尼亚全国普遍展开的增产节约运动中获得最好成绩的部门之一。在今年2月间，西那雅“伊·弗里姆”冶金工厂首先提出了“为降低每一件产品成本而斗争”的增产节约竞赛的口号。紧接着，成批成批的工业企业热烈地响应了这一竞赛号召。各单位纷纷召开生产会议，根据自己的实际情况制定了增产节约的具体计划。
    罗马尼亚各工业部门的增产节约运动是同改进工资制度同时进行的。改进后的工资制度，可以使工人的工资平均增加15％。
