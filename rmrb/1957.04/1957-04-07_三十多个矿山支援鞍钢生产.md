Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, April 5th: During the first quarter, when Anshan Iron and Steel was experiencing a shortage of ore raw materials, thirty-three mines across the country, including Lizhu, Jinling, Ma'anshan, Tongguanshan, and Longyan, supported Anshan Iron and Steel with more than 800,000 tons of raw materials such as iron ore, limestone, and manganese ore. Mines such as Lizhu, Changxing, and Guodian had simple equipment and faced difficulties in increasing production. Anshan Iron and Steel helped these mines build transportation lines with heavy rails, light rails, spikes, and sleepers, and also transported many air compressors, winches, generators, small mine cars, and other equipment to help these mines increase their production capacity.

The Cishan Iron Mine in Hebei Province originally planned to supply Anshan Iron and Steel with 100,000 tons of iron ore powder throughout the year. After learning about the shortage of ore raw materials, they took measures and delivered 90,000 tons of iron ore powder to Anshan Iron and Steel in the first quarter.

    三十多个矿山支援鞍钢生产
    新华社鞍山5日电　正在鞍钢矿石原料紧张的第一季度里，漓渚、金岭、马鞍山、铜官山、龙烟等全国三十三个矿山支援了鞍钢八十多万吨铁矿石、石灰石和锰矿石等原料。漓渚、长兴、郭店等矿山的设备简陋，增产有困难，鞍钢曾用重轨、轻轨、道钉、道木等材料帮助这些矿山建设运输线路，还运去许多台空气压缩机、卷扬机、发电机、小矿车等设备，帮助这些矿山增加了生产能力。
    河北省的磁山铁矿本来计划全年供给鞍钢十万吨铁矿粉，当他们了解矿石原料的紧张情况以后，就采取措施，在第一季度给鞍钢送来了九万吨铁矿粉。
