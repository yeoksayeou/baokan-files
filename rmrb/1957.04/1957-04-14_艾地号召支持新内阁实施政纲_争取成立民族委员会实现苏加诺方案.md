Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 13th: Indonesian Communist Party General Secretary D.N. Aidit said yesterday that the formation of the Djuanda Cabinet can be said to be in line with the wishes of the Indonesian Communist Party.

Aidit then pointed out that the formation of the Djuanda Cabinet does not mean that President Sukarno's plan has been 100% realized. Due to the mistakes of some party leaders who firmly oppose national unity and cooperation, the most important component of the President's plan, namely the spirit of cooperation, has not yet been realized.

Aidit said this in response to questions from a "Dong Xing Bao" reporter. He said that this is because almost all the people participating in the cabinet are considered patriotic, incorruptible, and capable. The inclusion of the establishment of a National Council in the new cabinet's program is in line with the spirit of the Sukarno plan.

Aidit said that the Indonesian Communist Party's attitude towards the new cabinet is: to support its actions that are beneficial to the people without reservation; to help improve its actions that are not beneficial enough to the people, and to oppose its actions that are harmful to the people. However, the Indonesian Communist Party's attitude focuses on supporting the current cabinet. If the current cabinet's actions are in conflict with the people, it is hoped that both sides will resolve them through consultation.

In his speech, Aidit called on the Indonesian people to do their best to support the new cabinet in implementing its program, and to continue to struggle to establish a National Council and fully realize the President's plan.

Regarding the question raised by the "Dong Xing Bao" reporter about the ongoing anti-corruption campaign, Aidit replied that he believes that if the anti-corruption work can be carried out without discrimination and without starting from personal or factional interests, its consequences will definitely be beneficial to the people. At the same time, cracking down on the corruption of some party leaders will also help those parties become healthier.

    艾地号召支持新内阁实施政纲
    争取成立民族委员会实现苏加诺方案
    据新华社雅加达13日电　印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地昨天说，朱安达内阁的成立可以说符合于印度尼西亚共产党的愿望。
    艾地接着指出，朱安达内阁的成立并不意味着苏加诺总统方案已经百分之百地实现了。由于坚决反对民族团结和合作的一些政党领袖的错误，总统方案最重要的成分即合作精神还没有实现。
    艾地是在答复“东星报”记者的问题时这样说的。他说，这是因为参加内阁的人几乎都被认为是爱国、不贪污和有工作能力的人。成立民族委员会被列入新内阁的政纲是符合苏加诺方案的精神的。
    艾地说，印度尼西亚共产党对新内阁的态度是：无保留地支持它的有利于人民的行动；帮助改善它对人民不够有利的行动和反对它对人民有害的行动。但是印度尼西亚共产党的态度着重于支持现内阁。如果现内阁的行动和人民有矛盾，希望双方以协商的方式来解决。
    艾地在谈话中号召印度尼西亚人民尽力支持新内阁实施它的政纲，并且为争取成立民族委员会和全部实现总统方案而继续斗争。
    对“东星报”记者提出的有关正在进行的肃清贪污行动的问题，艾地回答说，他相信如果能够不分彼此、不从个人利益和派别利益出发去开展肃清贪污的工作，它的后果一定会对人民有益。同时，肃清一些政党领袖的贪污行为，也将使那些政党健全起来。
