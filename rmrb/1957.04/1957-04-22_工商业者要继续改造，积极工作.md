Since the high tide of socialist transformation, private industrial and commercial business owners across the country have shown a new outlook in their work and study. According to incomplete statistics, over 1.2 million industrial and commercial business owners nationwide have participated in short-term training courses and amateur political theory studies in the past year, receiving enlightenment education on "destroying capitalism and establishing socialism." This has promoted their ideological transformation and work to varying degrees. During this year, the number of industrial and commercial business owners who actively completed their work tasks increased, and the relationship between public and private parties in enterprises also improved significantly. According to incomplete statistics from eight major cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Xi'an, Chongqing, and Shenyang, and twenty provinces including Hebei, approximately 650,000 industrial and commercial business owners participated in the socialist competition in the third quarter of last year, of whom 97,000 were selected as advanced workers or received material rewards. This shows that under the influence of the Communist Party's and the People's Government's policies of unity, education, and transformation, industrial and commercial business owners have taken another significant step on the road to socialism in the past year. The Party's policy of "starting from the desire for unity, going through criticism or struggle, and achieving new unity on a new basis" towards industrial and commercial business owners is entirely correct and effective.

However, while recognizing the positive and progressive side of industrial and commercial business owners, we must also recognize their negative and conservative side. Many still have nostalgia for capitalism. Some say: "Fixed interest of five percent for seven years, not much will be lost; personnel arrangements are settled, nothing will change. Now we can see the bottom of the river, the overall situation is just like this." Thus, the ideas of "settled" and "enough" have emerged. "Settled" means the mind is made up, and there is no more desire for transformation. "Enough" means getting by and not working actively, not caring about the enterprise as much as before joint ownership. Some even think they have "no attachment" to the enterprise. One private factory director was at home eating when a worker ran in to tell him that there was a fire at the factory and asked him to go quickly. But he didn't care, and slowly finished his meal before going. Some say they are "number two" in the enterprise, and do not solve the things they should be responsible for. Regardless of the size of the matter, they push it to the "number one" (the public representative). Some see themselves as "wealth," thinking that production is impossible without them, and thus look down on public representatives and the masses of workers. In many enterprises, private personnel are suspicious of each other, engaging in infighting. Those with strong abilities look down on those with weak abilities, those who are progressive look down on those who are backward, and those in lower positions are not convinced by those in higher positions, showing the narrow-minded and jealous thinking of Zhou Yu towards Zhuge Liang in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, "Since there is Yu, why is there Liang?" Particularly serious is that some private personnel attempt to alienate the relationship between workers and public representatives. Private personnel abuse their power to attack workers, alter account books and invoices, privately collect payments, embezzle public funds, and engage in fraud, etc., which have occurred in various provinces and cities. These situations are all contrary to the interests of the socialist state, and some are even intolerable by national law. This is also a concrete manifestation of the negative side of the bourgeoisie under new historical conditions. It reflects that in joint ventures, there are still class contradictions between workers and capitalists. The existence of this class contradiction is not surprising at all and is in line with the objective laws of historical development. The problem is not the existence of this contradiction, but the need to have a correct attitude towards it. Under China's specific conditions, although this class contradiction belongs to the non-antagonistic contradiction among the people, it must not be ignored simply because it is a non-antagonistic contradiction. This contradiction should be overcome by promoting the continued transformation of industrial and commercial business owners.

Currently, some industrial and commercial business owners do not admit that they have two sides. They become unhappy as soon as they hear "class relations" and "accepting transformation," saying that it is pouring cold water on their enthusiasm. Some say: "In terms of technology and culture, the public representatives and workers are not as good as me. The issue in the enterprise today is no longer who leads whom, or who accepts transformation, but only the matter of a master teaching an apprentice." This is not in accordance with the facts. Capitalists have given up their control over the means of production and assume certain positions in the enterprise. From this point of view, they are already public employees of the enterprise. Many of them have relatively high levels of culture and technology, and public representatives and workers should humbly learn from them, which is beyond doubt. However, on the other hand, since the capitalist's ownership of the means of production has not been finally abolished, and the capitalist still receives fixed interest (which is still a kind of exploitation), there is still a class relationship between them and the workers. In practical actions, bourgeois elements have progressive performances on the one hand, but also have relatively serious backward performances on the other hand, so it is necessary to continue transformation. This cannot be blurred. Pointing out the existence of class relations and the necessity of transformation for industrial and commercial business owners is by no means pouring cold water on the enthusiasm of industrial and commercial business owners; on the contrary, it is precisely to allow them to better understand the direction of continued progress and better exert their enthusiasm. Moreover, in our country, ideological transformation is needed for everyone. Because our country is in an era of unprecedented great changes, new things are growing every day, and old things are dying every day; old contradictions are overcome, and new contradictions emerge. In such an era, everyone who sincerely takes the socialist road and is unwilling to lag behind, including workers and our communists, must constantly carry out self-transformation to make their ideological understanding and style adapt to the requirements of social development. Now, why shouldn't industrial and commercial business owners, who are still receiving fixed interest and whose ideology and style are still far from that of self-reliant laborers, undergo transformation?

Industrial and commercial business owners must clearly recognize that using the enterprise as a base and through the practice of work is the main method of transforming themselves. Industrial and commercial business owners should be dutiful and responsible, work hard, actively participate in socialist competitions and the movement for increasing production and practicing economy, contribute all their talents to the socialist cause of the motherland, and gradually establish labor views and habits and cultivate and improve labor skills in long-term work practice, and transform themselves into laborers in the true sense of the word. Private personnel working in enterprises should, proceeding from the interests of the country, boldly put forward opinions and bravely carry out criticism and self-criticism on enterprise work, so as to realize mutual supervision between public and private parties in the cooperative relationship. However, on the other hand, private personnel must also obey the leadership of the public representatives, actively approach the masses of workers, and transform themselves by further improving the relationship between public and private cooperation.

Some industrial and commercial business owners, especially those who have graduated from short-term training courses, do not know where to continue their studies. Private personnel who have graduated from short-term training courses should preferably use the enterprise as a base and study together with workers and public representatives. In this way, political theory study can be combined with work practice, and the study and improvement of the relationship between public and private cooperation and private-private cooperation can be combined through study and discussion and mutual assistance, which is more conducive to the transformation of private personnel. However, at present, some private personnel still have concerns about studying with workers and public representatives, worrying that it will not be easy to open up their minds; the level of some private personnel is still not up to par, and the strength of leadership in study in small and medium-sized enterprises is generally still relatively weak. Therefore, private personnel studying with workers and public representatives must adopt a method of gradually developing and expanding in batches. When implementing it, the principle of voluntary participation by private personnel must be followed.

Transforming from a capitalist into a self-reliant laborer is not as easy as Sun Wukong transforming at will, but a process of rebirth. In this process, it is necessary to learn from practice and theory, especially from the masses of workers. There are difficulties here, and it is arduous, so there is no room for pride or impatience. Chairman Mao said: "Modesty makes one progress, and pride makes one lag behind." This is something that every industrial and commercial business owner needs to understand well.

### 工商业者要继续改造，积极工作

    工商业者要继续改造，积极工作
    社会主义改造高潮以来，全国私营工商业者在工作和学习上，都出现了新气象。据不完全统计，在这一年里，全国的工商业者已经有一百二十多万人参加了短期讲习班和业余政治理论学习，受到了“破资本主义、立社会主义”的启蒙教育。这对他们的思想改造和工作，都起了不同程度的促进作用。在这一年里，工商业者中积极完成工作任务的有所增加，企业中的公私共事关系，也有显著的改进。根据北京、天津、上海、广州、武汉、西安、重庆、沈阳八大城市和河北等二十个省的不完全统计，去年第三季度参加社会主义竞赛的工商业者约有六十五万人，其中被评选为先进工作者或者得到物质奖励的达九万七千人。这说明一年来，工商业者在共产党和人民政府的团结、教育和改造的政策影响下，又已在社会主义的道路上迈进了一大步。党对于工商业者采取“从团结的愿望出发，经过批评或斗争，在新的基础上达到新的团结”的方针，是完全正确和有效的。
    但是，我们在看到工商业者积极的、进步的一面的时候，也要看到他们还有消极的、保守的一面。不少的人对资本主义还有留恋。有些人说：“定息五厘七年，少不了什么；人事安排停当，变不了什么。现在是河水望到底了，大局就是如此这般。”于是，产生了“定了”、“算了”的思想。“定了”就是心思笃定，不再想改造。“算了”就是得过且过，不积极工作，不像合营以前那样关心企业了。有的人甚至认为对企业“毫无牵挂”了。有一位私方厂长在家吃饭的时候，工人跑来告诉他说，工厂发生火警，叫他赶快去。但他却毫不在意，仍慢吞吞地吃完饭才去。有些人说自己在企业里是“老二”，该自己负责解决的事也不解决，事无论大小，都推给“老大”（公方代表）。有些人则以“财富”自居，认为搞生产，非我不可，于是就瞧不起公方代表，瞧不起职工群众。在不少企业里，私方人员之间彼此猜忌，勾心斗角。能力强的看不起能力弱的，进步的瞧不起落后的，职位低的对职位高的不服气，大有三国演义上周瑜对诸葛亮所抱的“既生瑜，何生亮”的偏狭忌妒思想。尤其严重的是有些私方人员，企图离间工人同公方代表的关系。私方人员利用职权打击工人，涂改账册发票，私收账款，挪用公款，弄虚作假等等事情，在各省市里都发生过。上述这些情况，都是跟社会主义国家利益相矛盾的，有些甚至是国家法律所不能容许的。这也是在新的历史条件下，资产阶级两面性中消极性的具体表现。它反映了在合营企业里，工人和资本家之间仍然有阶级矛盾。这种阶级矛盾的存在是完全不奇怪的，合于历史发展的客观规律的。问题并不在于这种矛盾的存在，而在于对这种矛盾必须有正确的态度。在我国的具体条件下，这种阶级矛盾虽然是属于人民内部的非对抗性的矛盾，但是，绝不能因为它是非对抗性的矛盾就忽视它。应该以推动工商业者继续改造的办法来克服这种矛盾。
    现在，有某些工商业者不承认有两面性。他们一听到“阶级关系”、“接受改造”就不高兴，说是给他们的积极性泼冷水。有些人说：“论技术，论文化，公方代表和职工的没我高，今天企业里存在着的已经不是谁领导谁的问题，不是谁接受改造的问题，而只是师傅带徒弟的问题。”这是不符合事实的。资本家放弃了对生产资料的支配权，在企业里担负一定职务，从这一点上说，他们已经是企业的公职人员。他们之中，不少的人具有比较高的文化水平和技术水平，公方代表和职工应该虚心向他们学习，这是毫无疑问的。但是，另一方面，由于资本家对生产资料的所有权还没有最后被废除，资本家还拿定息（仍是一种剥削），所以在他们和工人之间仍然存在着阶级关系。在实际行动中，资产阶级分子一方面有进步的表现，一方面又确实还有比较严重的落后的表现，所以就必须继续改造。这是不能模糊的。我们指出阶级关系的存在，指出工商业者改造的必要性，绝不是给工商业者的积极性泼冷水，恰恰相反，正是为了让他们更好地认识继续前进的方向，更好地发挥积极性。况且在我们国家里，思想改造对每一个人都是需要的。因为我们国家正处在一个空前未有的伟大变革的时代，新事物天天在成长着，旧事物天天在衰亡着；旧的矛盾克服了，新的矛盾又出现。在这样的时代里，每一个真诚走社会主义道路而又不甘落后的人，包括工人和我们共产党人在内，都要时时进行自我改造，才能使自己的思想认识、作风，适合于社会发展的要求。现在还拿着定息、思想作风跟自食其力的劳动者还有很大距离的工商业者，为什么就不要进行改造了呢？
    工商业者必须明确认识：以企业为基地、通过工作的实践，是改造自己的主要方法。工商业者应该守职尽责，努力工作，积极参加社会主义竞赛和增产节约运动，把自己的一切才能贡献给祖国的社会主义事业，并且使自己在长期的工作实践中，逐步地树立劳动的观点和习惯，培养和提高劳动的技能，把自己改造成为名副其实的劳动者。在企业里工作的私方人员，对于企业的工作，应该从国家的利益出发，大胆地提出意见，勇敢地进行批评和自我批评，以便在共事关系中实现公私双方相互的监督。但是，在另一方面，私方人员又必须服从公方代表的领导，积极靠拢职工群众，从进一步改善公私共事关系中来改造自己。
    有些工商业者，特别是在短期讲习班结业的人，不知道在哪里继续学习才好。在短期讲习班结业的私方人员，最好以企业为基地，同职工和公方代表一起学习。这样可以通过学习讨论，互相帮助，把政治理论学习和工作实践结合起来，把学习和改善公私共事关系、私私共事关系结合起来，这更有利于私方人员的改造。不过，目前有些私方人员对于同职工和公方代表在一起学习还有顾虑，担心不易敞开思想；有些私方人员的水平还跟不上，中小企业中领导学习的力量一般还比较薄弱。因此，私方人员同职工、公方代表在一起学习，必须采取逐步开展、分批扩大的办法。在实行的时候，必须根据私方人员自愿的原则。
    从一个资本家变为一个自食其力的劳动者，这不像孙悟空要变就变那样轻而易举，而是一个脱胎换骨的过程。在这个过程里，需要从实践和理论中学习，尤其需要向职工群众学习。这里有困难，而且是艰巨的，骄傲不得，急躁不得。毛主席说：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后。”这对每一个工商业者来说，也都是需要好好领会的。
