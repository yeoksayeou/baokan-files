Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 23rd: Chairman Voroshilov, at the grand welcome banquet held in his honor tonight by Cao Diqiu, Vice Mayor of Shanghai, praised China's victory in the peaceful transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and extended congratulations to the patriotic national capitalists of Shanghai.

Tonight's welcome banquet was held in the magnificent industrial hall of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Building. Attending the banquet were Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Vice Premier He Long, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei, Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Liu Xiao, and Ke Qingshi, Secretary of the CPC Central Committee's Shanghai Bureau and First Secretary of the CPC Shanghai Municipal Committee, as well as nearly 500 prominent figures from all walks of life in Shanghai. The Soviet guests who accompanied Chairman Voroshilov on his visit also attended the banquet.

Cao Diqiu delivered a speech at the banquet, extending a warm welcome to the distinguished guests on behalf of the people of Shanghai.

Chairman Voroshilov spoke amidst warm applause. He first expressed his heartfelt gratitude for the grand and enthusiastic welcome from the people of Shanghai. He said that our hearts have long been closely intertwined with the hearts of the workers of Shanghai and all the people of China.

Chairman Voroshilov said that today we visited the Shanghai Joint State-Private Shenxin No. 9 Cotton Textile Factory. There, as in other former private enterprises, we saw particularly clearly the victory of the Chinese Communist Party's policy of peaceful transformation of private capitalist industry and commerce.

He said that the task of peacefully transforming the capitalist economy and incorporating it into the socialist track under China's unique realistic conditions is arduous and complex, and it is truly gratifying that this task has been widely and smoothly implemented in People's China. This experience of the Chinese Communist Party has immeasurable significance, both now and in the future.

Chairman Voroshilov said that we congratulate those patriotic Shanghai capitalists who have placed the interests of the whole people above their personal private interests and consciously and voluntarily participated in the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce. I believe that the united Chinese people will continue to victoriously carry out socialist construction in the future to benefit all working people, including the capitalists who actively participate in the construction of the new China through labor.

Chairman Voroshilov concluded by wishing the people of Shanghai new and brilliant achievements in construction.

    赞扬我国和平改造资本主义工商业的胜利
    据新华社上海23日电　伏罗希洛夫主席今晚在上海市副市长曹荻秋为他举行的盛大欢迎宴会上赞扬中国和平改造资本主义工商业的胜利，并向爱国的上海民族资本家们表示祝贺。
    今晚的欢迎宴会在中苏友好大厦壮丽堂皇的工业大厅中举行。出席宴会的有刘少奇委员长，贺龙副总理，外交部副部长姬鹏飞，中国驻苏联大使刘晓和中共中央上海局书记、中共上海市委员会第一书记柯庆施以及上海市各界著名人士近五百人。随同伏罗希洛夫主席前来访问的苏联客人们也出席了宴会。
    曹荻秋在宴会上代表上海人民向贵宾表示热烈欢迎。
    伏罗希洛夫主席在热烈的掌声中讲话。他首先对上海人民盛大、热情的欢迎表示衷心的感谢。他说，我们的心灵早已经和上海的劳动者以及全中国人民的心灵紧紧地融和在一起了。
    伏罗希洛夫主席说，今天我们参观了上海的公私合营申新第九棉纺织厂。在那里，如同其他的原来的私营企业一样，我们特别明显地看到了中国共产党的和平改造私人资本主义工商业政策的胜利。
    他说，在中国的独特的现实条件下和平地改造资本主义经济并将其纳入社会主义轨道的任务是艰巨复杂的，而这一任务在人民的中国已广泛地顺利地得到执行，这真是令人欢欣鼓舞的。中国共产党的这一经验不论在现在或其将来，都有无法估量的意义。
    伏罗希洛夫主席说，我们对于那些把全民的利益放在个人私有利益之上的、自觉自愿地参加私营工商业社会主义改造的上海爱国资本家表示祝贺。我相信，团结一致的中国人民在今后仍将胜利地进行社会主义建设，以造福全体劳动人民，其中也包括在劳动中积极参加新中国建设的资本家。
    伏罗希洛夫主席最后祝上海人民在建设中获得新的光辉的成就。
