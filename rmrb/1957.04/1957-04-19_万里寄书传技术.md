Sending Books Thousands of Miles to Transmit Technology

Many Soviet experts who made outstanding contributions to the construction of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant continue to frequently write to the workers, introducing new technologies in Soviet automobile production. The returned students and workers who studied in the Soviet Union from this factory receive six or seven letters from Soviet friends every day.

Not long ago, the workers of the tool workshop received four ball bearings and a blueprint from Kakilin, a Soviet tool expert, sent from Moscow. Kakilin came to China when the tool workshop of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant began trial production, and he worked with the workers to trial-produce a batch of particularly precise and complex shaving tools, returning to his country in January. In his letter, he said, "I miss you all very much. Before I left the factory, I decided to modify the gear grinding machine that was used to manufacture shaving tools, but it was not modified due to the lack of suitable ball bearings. Now I am sending four ball bearings and a modified blueprint for your reference." It turned out that after this precise gear grinding machine was shipped from the Soviet Union to China, the same model of grinding machine in the Soviet Union had new technological developments. Expert Kakilin had not even finished his vacation after returning to his country, but he collected Soviet drawings for modifying this grinding machine and sent special ball bearings, spreading the latest Soviet technological achievements to the automobile factory.

Shen Yaozong, an engineer in the metal products workshop and a former student in the Soviet Union who has returned to the factory, immediately writes to the process expert Akimov in Moscow for advice whenever he encounters difficult technical problems. No matter how busy the expert is, he always replies promptly to answer questions or mail reference books. Recently, expert Akimov learned that the metal products workshop's square tapping machine used to process tire lug nuts had low production efficiency and could not meet the needs of automobile production due to the lack of a device to remove iron filings. He introduced a new type of iron filings removal device used on a square tapping machine in a Soviet automobile factory to the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant.

Of the more than one hundred Soviet experts who came to our country to help build the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, most of them have now returned to their country after repeated extensions of their contracts. Chief expert Shigachyov also sent a letter from Moscow on April 16 to inquire about the recent production situation of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. (Xinhua News Agency)

    万里寄书传技术
    在建设第一汽车制造厂中有过卓越贡献的许多苏联专家，回国以后仍然经常来信向职工们介绍苏联汽车生产中的新技术。这个工厂已经回国的留苏实习生和职工，每天都要接到六、七封苏联友人的来信。
    不久以前，工具车间职工收到了苏联工具专家卡基林远从莫斯科寄来的四个滚珠轴承和一份图纸。卡基林从第一汽车制造厂工具车间开始试车生产就来到中国，他和职工一起试制完了一批特别精密复杂的剃齿刀具，在1月回国了。他在信里说，“我时刻在怀念着你们。在我离厂以前就决定把制造剃齿刀具的那台齿轮磨床加以修改，因为没有合适的滚珠轴承未修改成，现在寄来四个滚珠轴承和一份修改图纸，你们可以参照修改。”原来这台精密的齿轮磨床，从苏联运到中国以后，苏联同样型号的磨床在技术上又有了新的发展。卡基林专家回国还没有度完他的假期，就搜集了苏联有关改装这种磨床用的图纸，还寄来专用的滚珠轴承，把苏联最新的技术成就传播到汽车厂来了。
    已经回厂的留苏实习生、金属品车间工程师沈耀宗，每当遇到难解决的技术问题，就立刻写信去莫斯科请教工艺专家阿基莫夫。专家无论工作怎样繁忙，总是及时给他回信解答或邮寄参考书。最近阿基莫夫专家知道金属品车间加工轮胎螺丝帽用的四角攻丝机，因缺少清除铁沫子装置，生产效率低，满足不了汽车生产的需要，就把苏联一个汽车厂四角攻丝机上采用的一种新的清除铁沫子装置介绍给第一汽车制造厂。
    来我国帮助建设第一汽车制造厂的一百多名苏联专家，经过再三延聘之后，目前绝大部分都已经回国了。总专家希格乔夫，在4月16日还从莫斯科来信问候第一汽车制造厂近来生产情况。　（据新华社讯）
