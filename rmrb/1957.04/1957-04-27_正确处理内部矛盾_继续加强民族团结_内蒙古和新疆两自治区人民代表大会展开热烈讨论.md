Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 26th: The fourth session of the First People's Congress of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region closed yesterday.

	The meeting focused on the question of correctly understanding and handling contradictions among the people. The representatives believed that the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region had achieved a decisive victory in socialist transformation in the past year, the Party's prestige among the people of all ethnic groups had been further enhanced, and national unity had been further strengthened. However, a series of new problems have also arisen in the process of developing socialist undertakings. At present, some agricultural cooperatives in rural areas overemphasize collective interests and neglect the demands of their members, while members also tend to neglect collective and national interests. In pastoral work, untimely supply of materials and a decline in the prices of livestock and livestock products have aroused dissatisfaction among herders. In terms of ethnic relations, the main problems are still Han chauvinism and some local nationalism tendencies, mainly manifested in neglecting ethnic feelings and characteristics. In the work in agricultural and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, there have been instances of emphasizing agriculture over animal husbandry and forcibly pricing livestock for collectivization, resulting in the serious consequence of large-scale slaughter and sale of livestock in agricultural and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas. Some agricultural cooperatives did not pay enough attention to ethnic characteristics, which reduced the income of some Mongolian members.

	How to resolve the current contradictions among the people? Ulanhu, Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, put forward several specific measures: First, actively expand democratic life and create an atmosphere in various meetings such as people's congresses at all levels to allow the masses to freely express their opinions. Second, strengthen investigation and research, regularly go deep into the grassroots to inspect and check work, and improve the system of receiving people's visits. Third, strengthen political and ideological work and education on ethnic policies among the masses, and strengthen the unity and education of democratic personages and intellectuals from all walks of life.

	More than 300 people's representatives from Mongolian, Han, Daur, Hui, Korean, Manchu, and Oroqen ethnic groups participated in the meeting. The meeting passed resolutions such as vigorously carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy throughout the autonomous region.

	Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 25th: At the fourth session of the First People's Congress of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the delegates present spent two days in heated discussions on how to correctly handle contradictions among the people.

	Before the discussion, more than 270 representatives of all ethnic groups from both sides of the Tianshan Mountains and more than 100 senior intellectuals and democratic figures of all ethnic groups attending the meeting listened to the report by Burhan, a representative of the National People's Congress and Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, who came to Xinjiang for inspection, on this issue. In group discussions and speeches at the conference, representatives of all ethnic groups and people attending the meeting enthusiastically expressed their understanding and opinions based on the situations in their respective regions and departments. Everyone agreed that Chairman Mao's instructions were very timely and important, clarifying the distinction between contradictions between ourselves and the enemy and contradictions among the people, and clarifying the attitude that should be adopted when dealing with contradictions among the people. Many representatives from rural and pastoral areas also suggested further strengthening the ties between the government and the people of all ethnic groups, overcoming the shortcomings of bureaucracy and subjectivism in leadership, and strengthening political and ideological education.

	In the discussion, representatives of all ethnic groups expressed their willingness to widely publicize and explain Chairman Mao's instructions to the masses, assist the government in correctly handling contradictions among the people, and do a good job.

	The fourth session of the First People's Congress of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which began on the 15th, closed on the 24th. During the meeting, issues such as striving for a bumper harvest in agriculture and animal husbandry in 1957 and increasing production and practicing economy were also discussed.

    正确处理内部矛盾　继续加强民族团结
    内蒙古和新疆两自治区人民代表大会展开热烈讨论
    据新华社呼和浩特26日电　内蒙古自治区第一届人民代表大会第四次会议在昨天闭幕。
    这次会议着重地讨论了正确认识和处理人民内部矛盾的问题。代表们认为，内蒙古自治区在过去一年中取得了社会主义改造的决定性胜利，党在各族人民群众中的威信更加提高了，进一步加强了民族团结。但是，在社会主义事业发展过程中，又发生了一系列新的问题。目前农村中有些农业社过分强调集体利益，忽视社员的要求，而社员也有忽视集体利益和国家利益的倾向。在牧区工作上，物资供应不及时，牲畜和畜产品价格下降，引起牧民不满。在民族关系上，目前主要是大民族主义和某些地方民族主义倾向仍然存在，主要的表现是忽视民族情感和民族特点。农业区和半农半牧区工作中曾发生重农轻牧，强迫散畜作价入社，以致造成农业区、半农半牧区大量宰杀牲畜出卖的严重后果。某些农业社对民族特点注意不够，曾使部分蒙古族社员减少收入。
    怎样解决当前存在的人民内部的矛盾？内蒙古自治区主席乌兰夫提出了几项具体措施：一、积极扩大民主生活，在各级人民代表大会等各种会议上造成让群众自由发表意见的空气。二、加强调查研究。经常深入基层视察和检查工作，健全人民来访制度。三、加强在群众中的政治思想工作和民族政策教育，加强对各界民主人士、知识分子的团结教育。
    参加这次会议的有蒙古、汉、达呼尔、回、朝鲜、满、鄂伦春等民族的人民代表三百多人。会议通过了在全自治区范围内大力开展增产节约运动等决议。
    新华社乌鲁木齐25日电　在新疆维吾尔自治区第一届人民代表大会第四次会议上，到会代表们用两天时间就如何正确处理人民内部矛盾问题进行了热烈的讨论。
    在讨论前，来自天山南北的二百七十多名各民族的代表和一百多名列席会议的各民族高级知识分子、民主人士等，听了前来新疆视察工作的全国人民代表大会代表、政协全国委员会副主席包尔汉关于这个问题的传达报告。在小组讨论和大会发言中，各族代表和列席会议的人士都根据本地区和本部门的情况，热烈地谈出了自己的认识和意见。大家一致认为，毛主席的指示十分及时，非常重要，使他们分清了敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾的区别，明确了在处理人民内部矛盾问题时应该抱的态度。许多农村和牧区的代表还建议进一步密切政府和各族人民的联系，克服领导上的官僚主义和主观主义的缺点，加强政治思想教育工作。
    在讨论中，各族代表都表示要广泛地向群众宣传解释毛主席的指示，协助政府正确处理人民内部矛盾，搞好工作。
    从15日开始举行的新疆维吾尔自治区第一届人民代表大会第四次会议已经在24日闭幕。会议期间还讨论了争取1957年农牧业大丰收和增产节约等问题。
