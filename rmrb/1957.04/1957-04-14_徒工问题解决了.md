    The Apprentice Problem Solved
    By Our Reporter Song Zheng
    At the end of February and the beginning of March, a difficult problem confronted the leaders of the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory: At this time last year, the factory, according to instructions from higher authorities, recruited 240 apprentices and announced to them, in accordance with the regulations, that they would all be trained as third-grade workers within a year. The workshops also signed apprenticeship contracts based on this requirement. The promise was made last March and should be fulfilled this March. However, at this moment, instructions came from higher authorities: the apprentice examination should be temporarily postponed for all apprentices. The promise could not be kept. How could the leaders explain this to the masses!
    
    Changes in Situation Cause Apprentice Dissatisfaction
    The factory leaders clearly understood that these apprentices were originally to be trained to support the new factories. However, this year's capital construction plan for the First Ministry of Machine Building system has changed and is smaller than the initial plan last year. These apprentices would naturally have to stay in the factory. This year, the factory's tasks are not sufficient, and the funds and materials are limited, making it impossible to upgrade these two hundred apprentices to third-grade workers. Moreover, preliminary assessments showed that over 80% of these apprentices' operational skills did not meet the requirements of a third-grade worker. Not upgrading was not only necessary but also reasonable. However, the apprentices did not think so. Before the official instructions from higher authorities were issued, they had already heard some news. The apprentices' emotions fluctuated violently. Some scolded the leading cadres for not keeping their word, others said that the leadership was like this—problems could not be solved without making a fuss, and some clamored to have the factory director come out and explain, and then go to the State Council to reason. Some went to the personnel department to make noise, and some apprentices even discussed using passive resistance to threaten the leadership. The workshop cadres' emotions were also not normal. Seeing the masses making noise, some passively waited to be criticized, while others were impatient and wanted to find ways to deal with those apprentices who were spreading dissatisfaction with antagonistic emotions. Facing this rather tense situation, the leaders of the factory's Party, administration, and trade union also lacked confidence, had many concerns, and feared that the masses would cause trouble. Of course, they understood that the responsibility did not lie with the masses. The promise was made by the leaders. At that time, the masses were very happy after the promise was made, and they wrote letters to their families and friends, saying that they would be third-grade workers in a year and would be able to earn a certain amount of wages. After a year, the leadership suddenly went back on its word. How could the masses not have opinions? Moreover, these apprentices were young veterans and junior high school, higher primary school graduates, and technical school interns. Young people have not experienced hardship and do not know that the victory of the revolution did not come easily. They came to participate in socialist construction full of beautiful hopes and fantasies, not knowing that construction also requires going through countless hardships. Moreover, the factory's political and ideological education for them was not only insufficient but also had great one-sidedness, with more emphasis on beautiful prospects and less on hard work and thrift. Therefore, they felt that it was not surprising that these young apprentices had some excessive demands and that they should do a good job of educating them. Nevertheless, when they heard the apprentices' complaints and saw everyone's emotions so agitated, they did not have sufficient confidence in whether they could solve the problem well and quickly stabilize the masses.
    
    Explanation Improves the Attitude of the Masses
    At this moment, Chairman Mao's report on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, made at the Supreme State Conference, was conveyed. As the general branch secretary of the factory, Chen Tao, and the vice-chairman of the trade union, Ma Jun, said: This gave us confidence, gave us the capital to solve the problem, and straightened our backs. At this time, everyone understood that this was a contradiction among the people, and the solution to such a contradiction should start from the desire for unity, go through criticism and struggle, and reach a new unity on a new basis. Since the past educational work was insufficient and the masses did not understand the principles of hard work and thrift in building the country, they should intensify political education for the masses, establish correct thinking, and criticize wrong views. Since the masses did not understand why they were not allowed to take the examination and be upgraded temporarily, they should explain the real situation and let the masses understand. Based on this spirit, the Agricultural Machinery Factory carried out a series of tasks: they devoted a certain amount of time each day to giving the apprentices political lessons, educating them to observe problems and treat difficulties with the correct attitude; they first educated the apprentices' masters and the Party and Youth League members among the apprentices, clarified the situation, and mobilized them to work with the apprentices; they held forums among the apprentices, explained the situation to everyone, helped everyone analyze what attitude to take towards this situation, and explained that not focusing on production and passive resistance were detrimental to both the individual and the collective; they not only did not use crude methods to deal with those apprentices who were making the most noise but instead patiently and repeatedly educated them, striving to change their understanding and then educate others. One apprentice originally wanted to take the lead in passive resistance. After the help of the Party, administration, trade union, and Youth League organizations, he understood and immediately changed his attitude, taking the lead in persuading others, saying that he had forgotten the principle taught by the teachers at school that personal interests should be subordinate to collective interests. After a series of work, the masses' emotions stabilized. Some people said, I originally thought that only our factory was like this, but since the country has difficulties and the higher authorities have made such regulations, I have no objection. Some people who originally clamored to do as much work as they were paid now said that they would work actively regardless of whether they were upgraded or not. Some people said that their skills were not very good and that they should take this opportunity to study their skills well.
    
    Finding the Key to Solving the Difficult Problem
    When I visited the general branch secretary of the Agricultural Machinery Factory and several other responsible comrades, asking them to talk about their experience in studying Chairman Mao's report, they first told me about this small storm that had recently occurred in their factory. When talking about this matter, on their faces and in their tone, I could no longer feel the worry and bewilderment that they had when they talked about it a month ago. They repeatedly said with confidence, as if they had finally explored the law of dealing with problems after a long period of hard thinking, that Chairman Mao's report gave us capital, and the method of handling internal contradictions proposed by Chairman Mao was a good medicine! Indeed, they had confidence in their hearts, and their backs were straightened. For example, when talking about the issue of living and welfare, the deputy director of the factory in charge of personnel work said that there were many opinions from the masses in this regard, and everyone felt that things were difficult to handle. Now they understood that for problems that really cannot be solved, they should explain the situation to the masses, and the masses would understand. Problems that can be solved must be solved for the masses. If they cannot solve them themselves, they should also report them to the higher authorities for help. If the masses' demands are unreasonable, they should not only not be solved but also be educated. When solving the apprentice upgrading problem this time, the apprentices made some demands, some of which could not be met, and they had explained to the masses. Some of the demands were reasonable and could be solved, and they had asked the higher authorities for instructions and were preparing to solve them. The deputy director said that in the past, when encountering problems that could not be solved, they were afraid that the masses would say that they were bureaucratic. In fact, only taking a perfunctory and irresponsible attitude towards those reasonable problems that can be solved and not seriously solving them is called bureaucracy. As long as the situation is told to the masses, they will be able to distinguish right from wrong. They have also done work according to this principle for other problems recently raised by the masses. They also talked about the attitude towards political work, talked about some misunderstandings of the issues of democracy and discipline among cadres and workers since October last year, and talked about some measures to improve leadership. These problems had once made them feel distressed and difficult. But after studying Chairman Mao's report on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, it was as if a red thread had connected all the problems, and they were solved one by one, and everyone's thinking was suddenly enlightened. The problems that they had felt distressed and difficult about in the past can now be sorted out and answered.

    徒工问题解决了
    本报记者　宋琤
    2月底3月初，一个难题摆在北京农业机械厂领导者的面前：去年这时候，厂里根据上级指示，招收了二百四十名徒工，并且按照上级的规定向徒工们宣布了：一年之内把大家培养成三级工，车间里也根据这个要求签订了师徒合同。去年3月许下愿，今年3月就该还愿了。可是，就在这时候，上级来了指示：徒工一律暂缓考工。诺言不能实现，叫领导者怎么向群众说话！
    情况变化引起徒工不满
    厂里的领导者看得很清楚，这批徒工原是培养出来支援新厂的。可是，今年第一机械部系统的基本建设计划有了变动，比去年初的计划缩小了，这批徒工自然只好留在厂内；厂里今年任务不太足，资金材料都有限制，要把这二百多名徒工升为三级工也是不可能的。而且，经过初步考核，这次徒工80％以上操作技术都还达不到三级工的要求。不升级不但是必要的，也是合理的。可是徒工们却并不这样想。在上级指示正式下达以前，他们就多少知道了一点消息。徒工们情绪波动得很厉害。有人责骂领导干部说话不算话，有人说，领导就是这样，不吵不嚷不能解决问题，有些人吵着说：先让厂长出来讲，再到国务院去讲理；有些人跑到人事部门吵吵闹闹，有些徒工甚至商量好要用消极怠工的办法来威胁领导。车间干部的情绪也不很正常，看到群众吵闹，有的人消极地等着挨整，有的情绪急躁，用对立情绪对那些到处活动散布不满情绪的徒工，要想办法整一整他们。面对着这种颇为紧张的情况，厂里党、行政和工会的领导干部也信心不大，顾虑很多，害怕群众因此闹起事来。当然，他们明白，责任不在群众。愿，是领导许下的。当时，许下愿以后，群众非常高兴，纷纷写信告诉自己的家人亲友说一年以后自己就是三级工了，就可以拿到多少工资了……。而一年期满以后，领导上突然收回成命，群众怎么能够没有意见？而且，这批徒工都是年青的复员军人和初中、高小毕业生、技工学校实习生。年青人没有经过艰难困苦，不知道革命的胜利来之不易。他们满怀着美丽的希望和幻想，来参加社会主义建设，不知道从事建设也须要经过千辛万苦。而工厂里对他们的政治思想教育不但很不够，而且有很大的片面性，美好远景讲得多，艰苦奋斗讲得少。因此，他们觉得这些青年的徒工有些过高的要求是不足为怪的，应该好好地向他们进行工作。尽管如此，可是当他们听到徒工们的牢骚怪话，看到大家的情绪那么激动的时候，有没有妥善的办法把问题解决得很好，使群众很快地安定下来，他们也确实没有充分的信心。
    经过解释群众态度变好了
    正在这个时候，毛主席在最高国务会议上所做的正确处理人民内部矛盾的报告传达下来了。正像这个厂的总支书记陈涛和工会副主席马俊说的：这一下心里有了底了，有了解决问题的本钱，腰杆也硬了。这时候大家懂得了，这是人民内部的矛盾，解决这样的矛盾，应该是从团结的愿望出发，经过批评和斗争，在新的基础上达到新的团结。既然是过去的教育工作不够，群众还不大懂得艰苦奋斗勤俭建国的道理，就应该加紧对群众进行政治教育，树立正确的思想，批判错误的看法；既然群众不了解暂时不让他们考工升级，就应该把真实情况摆出来，让群众明白。农业机械厂根据这个精神，进行了一系列的工作：每天抽出一定时间给徒工们上政治课，教育他们用正确的态度来观察问题对待困难；对这些徒工的师傅和徒工中的党员团员首先进行教育，讲明情况，发动他们向徒工做工作；在徒工中举行座谈会，向大家讲清情况，帮助大家分析应该用什么态度对待这一情况，向大家说明不安心生产、消极怠工，对个人对集体都是不利的；对那些吵嚷得最厉害的徒工，不但不用粗暴的办法整他们，反而更耐心地反复地向他们进行教育，争取他们改变认识，再去教育别人，有一个徒工原来要带头消极怠工，经过党、行政、工会、青年团组织的帮助，他想通了，立即改变了态度，带头去说服别人，说他忘了在学校的时候老师教给他们的个人利益服从集体利益的道理。经过一系列的工作，群众情绪安定下来了。有的人说，原来我以为只有我们厂是这样，既然是国家有困难，上级作了这样的规定，也就没有意见了。有些人原来吵着说拿多少钱干多少活，现在表示不管升不升级，都要积极干活；有些人表示自己的技术并没有学得很好，现在要趁此机会好好学习技术。
    找到解决难题的钥匙
    当我访问农业机械厂的总支书记及其他几位负责同志，请他们谈谈学习毛主席报告的心得的时候，他们首先告诉了我他们厂里最近发生的这一场小风波。谈到这件事，在他们的脸上和语调中，再也感不到像他们谈起的一个月以前的那种忧虑和惶惑了。他们像经过长期苦思而终于摸索到了处理问题的规律那样，一再满怀信心地说，毛主席的报告给了我们本钱，毛主席提出的处理内部矛盾的办法是一剂良药！的确如此，他们是心里有了底了，腰杆子也硬了。比如，谈起生活福利问题，管人事工作的副厂长就说，这方面群众意见很多，大家也觉得事情难办，现在懂得了，凡是真正不能解决的问题，就对群众说明情况，这样群众就会想通了；能解决的一定要给群众解决，自己解决不了，还要反映给上级请求帮助解决；群众的要求如果不合理，不但不给解决，还应该对他们进行教育。这次解决徒工升级问题的时候，徒工提出了一些要求，其中有些是做不到的，已经向群众做了解释，有些是合理的也可以解决的，他们已向上级请示准备解决。这位副厂长说，过去一遇到不能解决的问题，就怕群众说是官僚主义。其实，只有对那些合理的而又能够解决的问题采取敷衍塞责的态度，不去认真解决，那才叫做官僚主义。只要把情况告诉群众，他们就会分清是非。最近群众提出的其他问题，他们也都按照这个原则去做了工作。他们还谈起对待政治工作的态度问题，谈起去年10月以来在干部和工人中对民主和纪律问题的一些错误的理解，谈到改进领导的一些措施。这些问题都曾经使他们感到苦恼，感到困难。可是一经学习了毛主席的正确处理人民内部矛盾的报告，像有一根红线把所有的问题都贯串起来一样，一个一个迎刃而解，大家的思想也豁然开朗起来，过去感到苦恼的感到困难的问题，现在都可以理出头绪找出答案了。
