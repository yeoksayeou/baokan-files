Xinhua News Agency, 11th Dispatch from Washington: Saudi Arabian Ambassador to the United States, Khayal, met with US Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, Rountree, on the 10th to discuss the situation in the Gulf of Aqaba. According to United Press International, Khayal expressed opposition to an American ship chartered to Israel passing through the Straits of Tiran on its own initiative last week. Saudi Arabia believes that the Gulf of Aqaba is territorial waters, and not all ships are allowed to pass through.

Xinhua News Agency, 11th Dispatch from Damascus: Syrian newspapers, quoting political figures, accused the action of an American oil tanker passing through the Gulf of Aqaba to Israel as a "blatant provocation against the interests of Egypt and Saudi Arabia."

Political figures said that this is a very serious matter. It proves that the United States is not taking an impartial attitude between Arabs and Israelis as it claims, and it also proves that the United States has given Israel a secret guarantee of free passage in the Gulf of Aqaba.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, April 11th: Egyptian officials announced here on the evening of April 10th that Israeli troops have refused the request of the United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF) to withdraw from Taba and Naqb Point in the Gulf of Aqaba region, which are within the jurisdiction of the UNEF in the Sharm el-Sheikh area, close to the Israeli port of Eilat.

An Israeli military spokesman said that such a withdrawal would not be considered until the fortifications of the Israeli port of Eilat were strengthened and expanded.

On April 10th, the Director of the Office of the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on the radio that Israel would not allow the UNEF to enter the Auja demilitarized zone. The United Nations had previously decided to send the UNEF into this area and use it as a base for these forces.

Israeli officials said that the Auja area controls the throat of southern Negev, so Israel cannot give it up. If the UNEF is stationed there, it will hinder the movement of Israeli armed forces in the Negev.

The 1949 armistice agreement between Israel and Egypt stipulates that the Auja area should be demilitarized and that Israeli armed forces should not be stationed in this area.

    沙特阿拉伯驻美大使和叙利亚政界人士
    谴责美国船只通过亚喀巴湾
    以色列军队拒绝从塔巴和纳奎布角撤退
    新华社11日讯　华盛顿消息：沙特阿拉伯大使哈雅尔10日同美国负责近东事务的助理国务卿朗特里举行会谈，讨论亚喀巴湾局势。据合众社消息说，哈雅尔对一艘出租给以色列的美国船只上星期径自通过蒂朗海峡表示反对。沙特阿拉伯认为亚喀巴湾是领海，不是一切船只都可以通过的。
    新华社11日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚报纸援引政界人士的话指责一艘美国油船通过亚喀巴湾前往以色列的行动是“对埃及和沙特阿拉伯的利益的公然挑衅”。
    政界人士说，这是一种非常严重的事情。它证明美国并不是像它自己所说的那样在阿拉伯和以色列之间采取不偏不倚的态度，也证明美国给了以色列在亚喀巴湾自由通航的秘密保证。
    新华社开罗11日电　埃及官方人士4月10日晚间在这里宣布，以色列军队拒绝联合国紧急部队的要求，不肯从亚喀巴湾地区的塔巴和纳奎布角撤出，这些地方在沙姆沙伊赫地区的联合国紧急部队的辖区以内，靠近以色列的埃拉特港。
    以色列军方发言人说，在加强和扩大以色列的埃拉特港的工事完成以前将不考虑这样的撤退。
    以色列外交部办公厅主任4月10日在广播中说，以色列不允许联合国紧急部队进驻奥贾非军事区。联合国先前已经决定派遣联合国紧急部队进入这个地区，并且利用这个地区作为这些部队的一个基地。
    以色列官员说，奥贾地区扼尼加夫南部的咽喉，因此以色列不能放弃它，如果联合国紧急部队驻在那里，是会妨碍在尼加夫的以色列武装部队的调动的。
    1949年以色列同埃及的停战协定规定，奥贾地区应当非军事化，以色列的武装部队不应当驻在这个地方。
