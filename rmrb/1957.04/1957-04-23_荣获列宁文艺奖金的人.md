    Recipients of the Lenin Prize for Literature and Art
    Readers have requested an introduction to the Soviet literary artists who have won the Lenin Prize. Here is a brief summary:
    Poet, Hero - Musa Jalil
    In the middle reaches of the Volga River in the Soviet Union, there is the Tatar Autonomous Republic. In the Tatar Autonomous Republic, there is a poet, Musa Jalil. Jalil was a true poet, who began writing fiery poems at the age of thirteen, and ultimately wrote his epic poems, "Prison Poems," with his very life. He endured torture at the hands of the Hitlerite fascists in Berlin's Moabit prison, and heroically sacrificed himself in January 1944, at the young age of thirty-eight. In prison, he wrote many poems with blood and tears. In 1956, on the occasion of Jalil's fiftieth birthday, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet posthumously awarded him the title of Hero of the Soviet Union. His "Prison Poems" have now been awarded the Lenin Prize.
    Before the war, Jalil was the leader of the Writers' Association of the Tatar Autonomous Republic. He was born into a peasant family in 1906, joined the Communist Youth League at the age of thirteen, participated in the civil war, and published his first poem in a newspaper. He published his first collection of poems at the age of nineteen. His long poem "The Postman," published in 1940, was very popular. Thus, he became a poet beloved by the Tatar people.
    In the first year of the Soviet Patriotic War, Musa Jalil took up arms and went to the front. He was a political worker and constantly wrote poems between battles, publishing the collection "Trench Letters." In June 1942, he participated in fierce fighting on the Volkhov Front and was captured after being seriously wounded. After being captured, he did not stop fighting: establishing secret organizations, arranging the escape of Soviet prisoners of war, and conducting political work. He continued to write poetry. His poems were circulated among comrades. The enemy learned of Musa Jalil's activities through traitors and locked him in the most gloomy solitary confinement cell in Berlin's Moabit prison. But the poet's fighting spirit grew stronger, and he wrote many good poems.
    Musa Jalil entrusted his prison manuscripts to a fellow prisoner—Belgian guerrilla fighter André Timmermans—for safekeeping and return to the Soviet Union. After the Soviet army liberated Berlin, the guerrilla fighter was released from prison and returned to his country, handing the small notebook containing the manuscripts to the Soviet Consulate in Brussels. The last page of the notebook had Jalil's will: "To the friends who read Tatar and will read this notebook. This was written by Musa Jalil, a poet familiar to the Tatar people. He endured all the horrors of the fascist concentration camp, did not bow to forty death threats, and was taken to Berlin. Here, he was accused of participating in secret organizations, conducting Soviet propaganda...was imprisoned, and sentenced to death. He is about to die, but he leaves behind one hundred and fifteen poems written in prison..."
    Musa Jalil's prison poems are full of infinite longing for the socialist motherland, unwavering confidence in the victory of the just cause, unwavering loyalty to the communist ideal, and the heroic spirit of regarding death as going home. In his poem "To the Executioner," he wrote the following lines:
    "Executioner, I will not yield to you,
    Even if I am your prisoner,
    Your slave in prison.
    When the moment comes, I will die.
    But I will die standing!
    Villain, even if you cut off my head."
    Sculptor Konenkov
    Konenkov is the oldest sculptor in the Soviet Union, currently eighty-three years old. The sculptor came from a peasant family in Smolensk. Later, he graduated from the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts. In his early realistic works, Konenkov created authentic images of Russian laborers. His sculptures won the Stalin Prize in 1951. Konenkov carved many portraits for the new buildings of Moscow University on Lenin Hills in Moscow, such as portraits of Turgenev, Ostrovsky, and others. His sculpture of Academician Pavlov also received great praise. Recently, he also sculpted "Shevchenko in Exile." This time, he won the award for his "Self-Portrait."
    Writer Leonov
    Leonov is an old Soviet writer—a novelist and playwright, born in 1899. During the Soviet Patriotic War, Leonov used his pen to participate in the war to defend the motherland. He wrote many war correspondence and essays, and at the same time wrote the famous play "Invasion." This play won the Stalin Prize in 1943. This time, he won the Lenin Prize for his novel "Russian Forest," published in 1953.
    Leonov has been awarded the Order of Lenin, the Order of the Red Banner of Labor, and the Order of the Patriotic War, First Class.
    Composer Prokofiev
    Prokofiev was an outstanding Soviet composer, pianist, and conductor, and also a People's Artist of the Russian Federal Republic, having won the Stalin Prize six times. Prokofiev showed musical talent from an early age, and began composing at the age of six. Later, he also studied with the famous Russian composer Rimsky-Korsakov. Many opera and ballet scores come from Prokofiev, such as the famous ballets "Romeo and Juliet," "The Stone Flower," and the opera "Semyon Kotko" based on Katayev's novel "I am the Son of the Working People." Prokofiev also composed music for films such as "Ivan the Terrible." This time, he won the Lenin Prize for his "Symphony No. 7."
    Prokofiev was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labor and other medals. He died in March 1953 at the age of sixty-two.
    Dancer Ulanova
    Ulanova is the most outstanding ballet dancer in the Soviet Union, a People's Artist of the Soviet Union. She came to our country in 1952 to perform. Ulanova was born in 1910 into a family with a cultivated appreciation for ballet art. Her father was a ballet conductor and her mother was a dancer.
    Ulanova has been performing at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow since 1944, creating many authentic, moving, vivid, and perfect images in classical ballet and Soviet ballet, including the leading roles in ballets such as "Swan Lake," "Sleeping Beauty," "Romeo and Juliet," and "The Fountain of Bakhchisarai."
    Ulanova has won the Stalin Prize four times and has also been awarded the Order of Lenin and other medals. (Attached pictures)

    荣获列宁文艺奖金的人
    读者要求介绍荣获列宁奖金的苏联文学艺术家，现在简答如下：
    诗人、英雄——嘉里尔
    在苏联伏尔加河中游有个鞑靼自治共和国，在鞑靼自治共和国有个诗人穆萨·嘉里尔。嘉里尔是真正的诗人，他从十三岁就开始写如火燃烧的诗，而且最后以自己的生命写成了可歌可泣的诗：狱中诗钞。他在柏林莫阿比特监狱受尽希特勒法西斯分子的折磨，在1944年1月英勇牺牲了，遇难时才三十八岁。他在狱中用血和泪写下了好多首诗。苏联最高苏维埃主席团在1956年嘉里尔五十岁时候追赠给他苏联英雄的称号。他的狱中诗钞现在获得了列宁奖金。
    在战前，嘉里尔是鞑靼自治共和国作家协会的领导人。他在1906年生于农民家庭，十三岁就加入了共产主义青年团，参加国内战争，在报上发表第一首诗。他在十九岁出版了第一本诗集。他在1940年发表的长诗“邮递员”，很受欢迎。这样，他成为鞑靼人民喜爱的诗人。
    在苏联卫国战争的头一年，穆萨·嘉里尔就拿起武器上了前线。他是政治工作人员，在战斗的间隙不断地写诗，出过“战壕来信”诗集。在1942年6月，他在沃尔霍夫前线参加激烈战斗，在重伤后被俘了。他被俘后没有停止斗争：建立秘密组织，安排苏军被俘人员的逃跑，进行政治工作。他继续写诗。他的诗在同志间传诵。敌人经过叛徒知道穆萨·嘉里尔的活动，把他关在柏林莫阿比特监狱的最阴森的单人房间里。但是诗人的斗志愈强，他写了许多好诗。
    穆萨·嘉里尔把狱中诗稿托同狱的朋友——比利时游击队员安德烈·吉米尔曼斯保存和送回了苏联。苏军解放柏林以后，这位游击队员出狱回国，把写着诗稿的小本子交给布鲁塞尔苏联领事馆。小本子的最后一页附有嘉里尔的遗嘱：“给读鞑靼文和将要读到这个本子的朋友。这是鞑靼人民熟悉的诗人穆萨·嘉里尔写的。他忍受了法西斯集中营中的一切恐怖，没有向四十次的死亡威胁低头，被解到柏林去。在这里，他被斥参加秘密团体，进行苏维埃宣传，……被关到监狱，被判处死刑。他将要死去，可是他留下在狱中写的一百一十五首诗……”
    穆萨·嘉里尔的狱中诗，充满着对社会主义祖国的无限怀念，对正义事业必胜的坚定信心，对共产主义理想的耿耿忠诚，和那种视死如归的英雄气概。他在“给刽子手”的诗中写着这样的字句：
    “刽子手，我不会向你屈服，
    即使我是你的囚徒，
    在狱中是你的奴隶。
    时刻到来了，我就死。
    可是，我要站着死！
    恶棍，那怕你把我的头砍去。”
    雕刻家柯年科夫
    柯年科夫是苏联最老的一位雕刻家，现年八十三岁。这位雕刻家出身于斯莫棱斯克一个农民的家庭。后来毕业于彼得堡美术学院。柯年科夫在早期的现实主义作品中，就创造了俄国劳动者的真实形象。他的雕刻作品于1951年曾获斯大林奖金。柯年科夫曾为莫斯科列宁山上的莫斯科大学新校舍雕刻过许多人像，如屠格?夫、奥斯特罗夫斯基等人的像。他所雕刻的巴甫洛夫院士像也获得了很大的赞誉。最近他还雕刻了“在流放中的舍夫钦科”。这次获奖的是他的“自塑像”。
    作家列昂诺夫
    列昂诺夫是苏联一位老作家——小说家兼剧作家，生于1899年。在苏联卫国战争时期，列昂诺夫用自己的笔参加了保卫祖国的战争。他写了不少战地通讯和论文，同时写成了名剧“侵略”。这个剧本在1943年获得了斯大林奖金。这次获得列宁奖金的是他1953年发表的长篇小说“俄罗斯森林”。
    列昂诺夫曾荣获列宁勋章、劳动红旗奖章、卫国战争一级勋章等。 
    作曲家普罗科菲耶夫
    普罗科菲耶夫是苏联卓越的作曲家、钢琴家和指挥，又是俄罗斯联邦共和国的人民演员，曾荣获过六次斯大林奖金。普罗科菲耶夫从小就表现出音乐才能，六岁时就开始写曲。后来又曾跟随俄国著名作曲家李姆斯基—柯萨科夫学习过。许多歌剧和芭蕾舞的音乐都出自普罗科菲耶夫之手，如著名的芭蕾舞剧“罗米欧与朱丽叶”、“宝石花”、根据卡达耶夫的小说“我是劳动人民的儿子”改编的歌剧“谢明·柯德科”等。普罗科菲耶夫也为“伊凡雷帝”等电影配过曲。这次获得列宁奖金的是他的“第七交响乐”。
    普罗科菲耶夫曾获劳动红旗勋章和其他奖章，于1953年3月逝世，享年六十二岁。
    舞蹈家乌兰诺娃
    乌兰诺娃是苏联最出色的芭蕾舞舞蹈家、苏联人民演员。她在1952年曾来我国演出过。乌兰诺娃于1910年诞生在一个对芭蕾舞艺术有素养的家庭里，她父亲是芭蕾舞指挥，母亲是舞蹈家。
    乌兰诺娃从1944年就在苏联莫斯科大剧院演出，在古典芭蕾舞剧和苏联芭蕾舞剧中创造出许多真实动人、鲜明完美的形象。其中包括“天鹅湖”、“睡美人”、“罗米欧与朱丽叶”、“巴赫奇萨拉伊喷泉”等芭蕾舞剧中的主角。
    乌兰诺娃曾获得四次斯大林奖金，还荣获过列宁勋章和其他奖章等。（附图片）
