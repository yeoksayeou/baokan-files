    Serious Waste of Food in Government Offices and Schools
    State Council Calls on Localities to Inspect and Rectify in Conjunction with the Production Increase and Thrift Campaign

    Xinhua News Agency, 6th. The Ministry of Food and the Ministry of Supervision recently submitted a report to the State Council, exposing the serious waste of food in some government offices, organizations, enterprises, and schools.

    The report pointed out that some units had failed to effectively implement the food supply system, failing to create food consumption plans based on the actual number of people and quota standards, and instead adopting methods such as falsely reporting the number of people and overreporting the number of days to purchase more grain. For example, five units in Bin County and two other counties in Shaanxi Province actually used more than 260,000 jin of grain, but falsely reported it as more than 940,000 jin. In a drilling team in Chaochuan, Linru County, Henan Province, all five or six hundred family members of the employees were calculated according to the quota standard for workers, purchasing an extra 18,000 jin of grain in three months. Due to the overreporting and overpurchasing of grain, a large amount of grain has been stockpiled. For example, five schools including Wuhan University once stockpiled 330,000 jin of grain.

    The report stated that the waste of food is serious in some units, with leftover rice and steamed buns being thrown around and wasted at will. The food departments and supervisory agencies in Fujian Province inspected ten units in one day and found more than 190 jin of wasted rice.

    In the report, the Ministry of Food and the Ministry of Supervision particularly hoped that all government offices, enterprises, schools, and other units would pay attention to strengthening ideological education on cherishing food among their staff, so that everyone can cherish the fruits of farmers' hard work and overcome waste.

    The State Council forwarded the report of the Ministry of Food and the Ministry of Supervision. In a circular, the State Council also pointed out that this waste of food is serious, and all localities should conduct inspections and corrections of the waste of food in conjunction with the production increase and thrift campaign, in order to truly establish a good atmosphere of thrift in food consumption.

    机关学校浪费粮食情况严重
    国务院要各地结合增产节约运动检查纠正
    新华社6日讯　粮食部、监察部最近在向国务院提出的一份报告中，揭发了一些机关、团体、企业、学校浪费粮食的严重情况。
    这份报告中指出，有些单位没有切实执行粮食供应制度，不根据实有人数和定量标准编造用粮计划，而是采取虚报人数、多报天数等办法多购粮食。如陕西省邠县等三个县有五个单位实际用粮二十六万多斤，虚报为九十四万多斤。在河南省临汝县朝川的一个钻探队，把五、六百个职工家属全部按工人的定量标准计算，在三个月中多购了一万八千斤粮食。由于存在多报和多购粮食的情况，这就造成大量粮食的积压。如武汉大学等五个学校有一个时期就曾积压了三十三万斤粮食。
    报告中说，浪费粮食的情况在有些单位是严重的，有的把剩饭剩馒头到处乱扔，任意糟蹋。福建省粮食部门和监察机关在一天中抽查了十个单位，共发现糟蹋米饭一百九十多斤。
    粮食部、监察部在报告中特别希望各机关、企业、学校等单位要注意对所属人员加强爱惜粮食的思想教育，使大家都能珍惜农民辛勤劳动的成果，克服浪费现象。
    国务院批转了粮食部和监察部的这份报告，国务院同时在通报中指出，这种浪费粮食的情况是严重的，各地应该结合增产节约运动，对浪费粮食的情况进行检查和纠正，以真正树立起节约粮食的优良风气。
