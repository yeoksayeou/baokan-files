    Japanese Socialist Party
    The Japanese Socialist Party is a relatively large opposition party in Japan. It holds 156 seats in the 467-seat House of Representatives of the Japanese Diet and 80 seats in the 250-seat House of Councillors. Currently, the Socialist Party has more than 43,000 members and has a considerable influence in the Japanese labor movement.
    The Japanese Socialist Party was founded on November 2, 1945. It included the former Social Mass Party, Japan Labor-Farmer Party, Japan Proletarian Party, and Japan Farmers Party. In the first general election after the enactment of the new Japanese Constitution in April 1947, the Socialist Party won 143 seats in the House of Representatives, becoming the largest party in Japan. In May of the same year, Tetsu Katayama of the party came forward to form a cabinet, establishing a three-party coalition government with the Democratic Party and the People's Cooperative Party. However, the Katayama cabinet resigned after only eight months in power. In July 1948, left-wing figures such as Hisao Kuroda split from the Socialist Party to form the Labor-Farmer Party. In the general election held in January 1949, the Socialist Party only won 48 seats.
    In September 1951, the Yoshida Cabinet signed the Treaty of San Francisco and the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty with the United States. Shortly before the Diet approved these two treaties in October of the same year, the Socialist Party split due to disagreements over these two treaties, with the left and right factions finally declaring a split.
    From this time on, the Left-wing Socialist Party, chaired by Mosaburo Suzuki, and the Right-wing Socialist Party, chaired by Jotaro Kawakami, were established.
    In December 1954, the Yoshida Cabinet stepped down. Subsequently, the Hatoyama Cabinet, which took "restoring diplomatic relations between Japan and the Soviet Union and Japan and China, and expanding Japan-China trade" as its top promise, came to power. In the February 1955 House of Representatives election, the Left-wing Socialist Party won 89 seats, and the Right-wing Socialist Party won 67 seats.
    As the Japanese people's movement to defend peace and strive for independence grew, the opinions of the left and right factions of the Socialist Party gradually converged, and in October 1955, the two factions of the Socialist Party were unified. The chairman of the unified Socialist Party was Mosaburo Suzuki, and the secretary-general was Inejiro Asanuma.
    After the unification of the Socialist Party, it put forward the proposition of safeguarding democratic rights internally; externally, it promoted the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China and the Soviet Union, and advocated the abolition of unequal treaties between Japan and the United States. In the July 1956 Japanese House of Councillors election, the Socialist Party gained twelve more seats.
    In January of this year, the Japanese Socialist Party convened its first party congress after unification. At this meeting, the Socialist Party criticized the Ishibashi cabinet's policy of succumbing to the United States, and with the goal of achieving peaceful independence, it determined the action plan, organizational policy, general election countermeasures, agricultural policy, small and medium-sized enterprise policy, and local assembly countermeasures for 1957. In particular, it determined to focus on four major people's movements: upholding the Constitution, opposing military bases, demanding the return of Okinawa, and restoring diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and to coordinate with the massive movement against atomic and hydrogen bombs, concentrating efforts to revise or abolish the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, the Administrative Agreement, and other unequal treaties. The resolution of this meeting opposed the so-called "two Chinas" theory. In the outline of the movement to restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China, which was determined by the Special Committee for the Restoration of Diplomatic Relations between Japan and China on February 9, the policy of promptly restoring diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China was further determined.
    The Labor-Farmer Party, formed in 1948 by people who split from the Socialist Party, rejoined the Socialist Party in mid-January of this year. (Hai)

    日本社会党
    日本社会党是日本在野党中势力较大的政党。它在日本国会众议院的四百六十七个议席中，占有一百五十六席；在参议院的二百五十个议席中，占有八十席。目前社会党有党员四万三千多人，在日本工人运动中有相当的影响。
    日本社会党是在1945年11月2日成立的。它包括了以前的社会大众党、日本劳农党、日本无产党和日本农民党。1947年4月在日本新宪法制定后的第一次大选中，社会党在众议院中占一百四十三席，成为日本的第一大党。同年5月，该党片山哲出面组阁，同民主党、国民协同党成立了三党联合政府。但是，片山内阁执政不过八个月就下台了。1948年7月，黑田寿男等左翼分子从社会党分裂出来，成立了劳农党。在1949年1月举行的大选中，社会党只取得了四十八个议席。
    1951年9月，吉田内阁同美国签署了旧金山和约和美日安全条约。在同年10月国会批准这两个条约前不久，社会党由于对这两个条约的意见发生分歧，左右两派终于宣告分裂。
    从这个时候起，成立了以铃木茂三郎为委员长的左派社会党和以河上丈太郎为委员长的右派社会党。
    1954年12月吉田内阁下台。接着，以“恢复日苏、日中邦交，扩大日中贸易”作为第一项诺言的鸠山内阁上了台。1955年2月的众议院选举中，左派社会党获得八十九席，右派社会党获得六十七。
    在日本人民保卫和平和争取独立运动日益高涨的情况下，左右两派社会党的意见逐渐接近，于是在1955年10月实现了两派社会党的统一。统一后的社会党的主席是铃木茂三郎，书记长是浅沼稻次郎。
    社会党统一以后，对内提出了保卫民主权利的主张；对外力促日本同中国、苏联恢复邦交，并主张废除日美不平等条约。1956年7月日本参议院选举中，社会党又增加了十二个议席。
    今年1月，日本社会党召开了统一后的第一次党代表大会。在这次大会上，社会党批判了石桥内阁屈从美国的政策，并以争取和平独立为目标确定了1957年度的行动方针、组织方针、大选对策、农业政策、中小企业政策及地方议会对策等。特别是确定了以拥护宪法、反对军事基地、要求收回冲绳、恢复日中邦交四大人民运动为中心，并且同巨大的禁止原子弹氢弹的运动相配合，集中力量争取修改或废除美日安全条约、行政协定等不平等条约。这次大会的决议中，反对了所谓“两个中国”的说法。在社会党2月9日恢复日中邦交特别委员会确定的恢复日中邦交运动纲要中，更进一步确定了迅速同中华人民共和国恢复邦交的方针。
    1948年由从社会党分裂出去的人组成的劳农党，在今年1月中旬重新加入了社会党。　　　（海）
