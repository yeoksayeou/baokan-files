    Early Marriage Has Many Disadvantages, But It Is Not Illegal
    Commentator of this newspaper

    According to readers' letters, a phenomenon of "rushing into marriage" has occurred in many places, especially in rural areas. Some people, after reading articles in some newspapers and periodicals about the inadvisability of early marriage for young people and seeing suggestions to raise the legal marriage age, have presumptuously assumed that Article 4 of the Marriage Law is about to be amended. Some young men and women, who originally did not plan to marry at this time, have hastily married for fear that they might not be able to marry for two or three years if the legal marriage age is raised; some parents are also busy finding partners or holding weddings for their young children; and marriage registration authorities are also becoming busy as a result. This situation shows that our publicity work on advocating later marriage is not in-depth enough, leading to misunderstandings among some people.

    Early marriage has many disadvantages, but the habit of early marriage has long existed in our society, and the phenomenon of "rushing into marriage" is precisely due to this habit of early marriage. However, changing this bad habit cannot be achieved overnight by administrative orders or legal regulations. The reason why China's Marriage Law stipulates that the minimum marriage age is twenty for men and eighteen for women, instead of setting the most suitable marriage age for young people—say, around twenty-five—as the legal marriage age, is based on the physical development of young men and women on the one hand, and taking into account social customs on the other. Because once the law is stipulated, it must be enforced, and no one may violate it. If the legal marriage age is too high and exceeds the social habit of marriage age before the habit of early marriage has changed in society, it will lead to more people violating the law, causing social turmoil.

    However, articles published in newspapers and periodicals and opinions expressed by certain people are not the same as legal regulations. The purpose of doing so is only to hope that young men and women will truly recognize the harm of early marriage ideologically and consciously and voluntarily postpone the marriage age, which does not carry any element of coercion. In fact, many young people have now accepted the advice of public opinion and decided to postpone their marriage. The letter from Guanzhong published in today's newspaper is an example. Some people have put forward the most suitable marriage age, which is only for unmarried young people to refer to, and it is not, nor does it have the right to, require unmarried young people to marry at this age. The perception by some people that the legal marriage age will be changed to thirty for men and twenty-five for women—which many people advocate as the most suitable age for marriage—is entirely a misconception arising from confusing legal regulations with public opinion advocacy.

    Now that misunderstandings have occurred among the masses, what should be done? There is only one way, and that is to widely publicize the positive significance of marrying later to the masses, so that the masses can recognize the harm of early marriage, so as to gradually change the social habit of early marriage; at the same time, it is also necessary to explain that public opinion advocacy is not the same as legal regulations, and tell those masses who still have ideological resistance to marrying later that they do not need to panic and rush to marry early.

    However, when advocating later marriage and conducting publicity, we can only tell young people the harms of early marriage and the benefits of marrying later, and there must be no coercion or command. As for marrying earlier or marrying later, as long as it does not violate the provisions of the Marriage Law, it is their own business and can only be decided by themselves.

    Recently, some places have not made the publicity for advocating later marriage completely appropriate, resulting in a bad atmosphere, putting some pressure on young men and women in their twenties who are about to get married, as if they have done something disgraceful. This makes many young people who are in love and preparing to get married feel uneasy, not knowing what to do, and even their work, production, and study have been affected. We should vigorously publicize the benefits of marrying later; however, getting married in accordance with the provisions of the Marriage Law is the right of young men and women, and no one can interfere, nor should they satirize, ridicule, or discriminate. Freedom of marriage is protected by national law. Marriage registration authorities cannot refuse to register those who have reached the legal marriage age on the pretext of advocating later marriage.

    早婚害处多，但是不犯法
    本报评论员
    据读者来信反映：很多地方，特别是农村，发生了“突击结婚”的现象。部分群众看到一些报刊登载了青年结婚不宜过早的文章，又见有人建议提高法定的结婚年龄，就想当然地认为婚姻法的第四条要修改了。有些青年男女本来目前还不打算结婚，但是唯恐法定结婚年龄提高以后，可能自己在两三年不能结婚，就提早草率结了婚；有些做父母的也忙着给自己年轻的子女找对象或办喜事；婚姻登记机关也因此忙了起来。这种情况说明我们对提倡迟一点结婚的宣传工作做得还很不深入，以致部分群众发生了误解。
    过早结婚有许多坏处，但是长期以来我国社会上就存在着早婚的习惯，发生“突击结婚”的现象，也正是这种早婚习惯在作怪。但是要改变这种不好的习惯，绝不是一朝一夕用行政命令或法律规定能够办到的。我国的婚姻法所以规定男子二十岁，女子十八岁为最低的结婚年龄，没有把青年最适宜结婚的年龄——比如说二十五岁左右作为法定的结婚年龄，就是一方面根据男女青年身体发育的状况，另一方面则是照顾到社会的习惯。因为法律作了规定，就要强制执行，任何人不得违犯。如果在社会上早婚习惯还没有改变的情况下，法定的结婚年龄过高地超过社会习惯的结婚年龄，就会导致较多的人违法，造成社会的紊乱。
    但是报刊上刊载文章，某些人发表意见，并不等于法律的规定，这样做的目的只是希望青年男女真正从思想上认识到过早结婚之害，而自觉自愿地把结婚年龄推迟一些，并不带有丝毫强迫的性质。事实上，现在已经有许多年轻人接受了舆论的劝告，决定延迟一些时候结婚。今天报上发表的关中的来信，就是一个例子。有些人提出了最适宜的结婚年龄，也只是供未婚青年们参考，并不是、也没有权利要未婚青年都必须在这个年龄结婚。某些群众认为法定的结婚年龄将改为男三十岁，女二十五岁——很多人主张这是结婚最适宜的年龄——这完全是把法律规定同舆论提倡混淆起来所产生的一种错觉。
    既然在群众中已经发生了误解，应该怎么办呢？办法只有一个，就是向群众广泛宣传迟一点结婚的积极意义，让群众认识到早婚之害，以逐渐改变社会上的早婚习惯；同时还要说明舆论提倡并不等于法律规定，告诉那些对迟一点结婚思想上还有抵触的群众，也不必惶惶然急于提前结婚。
    但是，提倡迟一点结婚，进行宣传的时候，只能告诉青年人过早结婚的害处和迟一点结婚的好处，不能有任何强迫命令。至于早一点结婚还是迟一点结婚，只要不违反婚姻法的规定，都是他们自己的事情，只能由他们自己来决定。
    最近有些地方对提倡迟一点结婚的宣传，作得并不完全适当，以致造成了一种不好的气氛，对二十来岁就要结婚的青年男女多少有些压力，好像这是做了什么不光采的事情。这使许多正在恋爱和准备结婚的青年感到不安，不知如何是好，甚至工作、生产、学习也为此受到影响。我们应该大力宣传迟一些结婚的好处；但是，按照婚姻法的规定结婚，这是青年男女的权利，任何人不能干涉，也不应当讽刺、讥笑和歧视。婚姻自由受到国家法律的保护。婚姻登记机关也不能借口提倡迟一些结婚，拒绝已到法定结婚年龄的人登记结婚。
