    (Our Dispatch) In February and March, thirty-four members and alternate members of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party went deep into the grassroots to deliver political reports to the masses. After listening to the reports of the provincial committee members and alternate members, some localities organized various symposiums for discussion. Many comrades who gave reports personally participated in these symposiums to listen to the masses' feedback on the reports, solicit their opinions on the work of the Party and government, and help solve practical problems in their work.

    Before giving reports, these thirty-four comrades generally investigated and studied the audience's ideological situation and practical problems in their work, and then drafted report outlines to make the reports more practical. Before giving a report in Chengguan Township, Longyao County, Comrade Li Jiping investigated the ideological situation of cadres and masses in nine agricultural cooperatives and visited thirty-two peasant households. Before giving a report to cadres and masses in Zhao County, Comrade Liang Shuangbi first held small-scale symposiums for grassroots cadres and visited agricultural cooperatives to understand the ideological situation of cadres and masses before writing a report outline. Because the preparatory work before the reports was done well, the contents of these political reports were generally relatively rich and could solve the ideological problems of the masses, thus greatly inspiring the masses' enthusiasm for work and production. After listening to the report of Comrade Lin Tie, Secretary of the Provincial Committee, the students of Zhuoxian Cooperative Cadre School unanimously expressed their determination to run the agricultural cooperatives better and wrote letters to their agricultural cooperatives, asking them to start accumulating fertilizer and preparing for cultivation first. Comrade Ma Guorui gave a report at a meeting of township branch secretaries, township heads, agricultural cooperative directors, and production team leaders convened by the Mancheng County Committee, conveyed Chairman Mao's call to strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture this year. The cadres attending the meeting were doubled in their confidence in increasing production, and the cadres of 167 agricultural cooperatives made their own cooperative's production increase plans. At the meeting, the county's plan to produce 97,010,000 catties of grain this year was revised to 104 million catties.

    Because the provincial committee members and alternate members took the lead in giving reports to the masses, they also inspired many prefectural and county committee members to go down to the countryside and factories to give political reports to the masses. According to incomplete statistics from nine special districts, in February and March, more than 22,400 prefectural and county committee members and responsible persons from various departments gave political reports to the masses.

    The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has now decided that, starting from the first quarter of this year, provincial committee members and alternate members will give a report to the masses every quarter on the current situation and tasks or the Party's various policies; at the same time, it is required that responsible comrades of organs above the county level do the same, so as to form a regular system.

    中共河北省委委员深入基层作政治报告
    鼓舞了群众生产积极性带动了地委县委委员下乡下厂
    本报讯　中共河北省委在2、3月份，已有三十四位省委委员和候补委员先后深入基层，向群众作了政治报告。有些地方在听了省委委员和候补委员的报告之后，组织了各种座谈会，进行了讨论。许多作报告的同志都亲自参加了这些座谈会，听取群众对报告的反映，征求群众对党和政府工作的意见，帮助解决实际工作中的问题。
    这三十四位作报告的同志，在报告以前一般都调查研究了听众的思想情况和实际工作中的问题，然后再草拟报告提纲，使报告能更切合实际。李吉平同志在隆尧县城关乡作报告以前，先调查了九个农业合作社干部和群众的思想情况，分别访问了三十二户农民家庭。梁双璧同志在赵县向干部和群众作报告以前，先召开小型的基层干部座谈会、并深入农业社进行访问，了解了干部和群众的思想情况之后，才写出报告提纲。由于报告前的准备工作做得较好，这些政治报告的内容一般都比较丰富、能解决群众的思想问题，因而大大地鼓舞了群众的工作和生产的积极性。涿县合作干部学校的学员们听了省委书记林铁同志的报告以后，一致表示要把农业社办的更好，纷纷给自己的农业社写信，要求首先把积肥备耕工作开展起来。马国瑞同志在满城县委召开的乡支部书记、乡长、农业社主任和生产队长会议上作了报告，传达了毛主席对争取今年农业大丰收的号召，与会干部增产信心倍增，一百六十七个农业社的干部都作出了本社的增产计划，会上并把全县今年计划产粮九千七百零一万斤的计划修改为一亿零四百万斤。
    由于省委委员、候补委员带头向群众作报告，也鼓舞了许多地委和县委委员下乡下厂向群众作政治报告的积极性。据九个专区不完全的统计，在2、3月份先后有二万二千四百多个地委、县委委员和各部门的负责人员向群众作了政治报告。
    现在中共河北省委已经作出决定，从今年第一季度起，省委委员和候补委员每个季度向群众作一次关于当前形势与任务或党的各项政策问题的报告；同时要求县以上各机关的负责同志都要这样做，以便形成一种经常性的制度。
