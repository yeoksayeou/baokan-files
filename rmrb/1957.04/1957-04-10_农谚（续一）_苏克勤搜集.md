II. On Accumulating and Applying Fertilizer

"Manure is gold in the field, pigs are treasures in the home."

"Good manure and frequent rain, no need to ask anyone." "People are iron, food is steel, barren land due to lack of manure." "If you don't fertilize when planting, the year will be wasted." "Pig hooves and sheep urine" (referring to manure produced by pigs and sheep as good fertilizer). "The sound of the broom (referring to sweeping up garbage), the longer the manure pile." "Sweep the house every day (referring to sweeping up garbage to accumulate fertilizer), as good as a pig for the whole year." "Soil in the morning (referring to bedding the pen), collect manure in the evening, the grain in the field will fill the granary." "If you want crops to grow strong, don't leave the manure basket when you go out" (referring to carrying a basket to collect manure). "Picking up manure is like picking up gold." "Pull up one more basket of grass (referring to pulling up grass for bedding), as good as buying ten catties of material (material refers to fertilizer)."
