Xinhua News Agency, April 15th: The Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, K.Y. Voroshilov, arrived in Beijing at 3:00 PM today aboard a Tu-104 jet aircraft. Chairman Voroshilov is visiting China at the invitation of Chairman Mao Zedong.

Chairman Mao Zedong, Vice Chairman Zhu De, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and Premier Zhou Enlai were at the airport to welcome him.

The streets were lined with Chinese and Soviet national flags, colorful flags, and red banners, resembling a colorful corridor from afar.

More than 20,000 people gathered at the airport today to welcome the distinguished guest.

After the plane landed at Nanyuan Airport, Chairman Voroshilov appeared at the cabin door. He stood for a moment, waving his hat to the crowd. At this moment, cheers and applause rang out at the airport.

Chairman Voroshilov stepped off the plane, smiling and shaking hands firmly with Chairman Mao Zedong.

Chairman Voroshilov, with white hair and a silver beard, was radiant and full of energy. Chairman Mao Zedong said with a smile to Chairman Voroshilov: "You are in such good health! Welcome, the entire Chinese people welcome you, and the weather today is also welcoming you!" Chairman Voroshilov replied: "From the moment we flew towards the great People's Republic of China, good weather has been with us. Therefore, my health is even better."

At 3:55 PM, Chairman Voroshilov and Chairman Mao Zedong rode together in an open-top car, slowly heading towards Zhongnanhai. Behind this car, thousands of cars followed one after another, slowly moving through the dense crowds lining the streets. The streets were filled with the sound of gongs and drums, and the masses were jubilant. Many girls in brightly colored costumes scattered flower petals on Chairman Voroshilov and Chairman Mao. The crowd greeted the open-top car with various musical instruments, waving Chinese and Soviet national flags, colorful flags, and bouquets. They shouted to the distinguished guest, "Long live Sino-Soviet friendship," and "Welcome to the distinguished guest from the Soviet Union." Chairman Voroshilov constantly waved to the welcoming crowd, and scattered the flower petals thrown on the car back to the welcoming crowd.

The closer to the city center, the more people lined the streets to welcome the guests. In Tiananmen Square, thousands of people crowded the wide square and the red viewing platform, and the railings of the Jinshui Bridge were also full of people. When Chairman Voroshilov and Chairman Mao passed by here, thousands of colorful balloons were released, carrying huge banners proclaiming the eternal friendship between China and the Soviet Union. Here, the open-top car carrying Chairman Voroshilov and Chairman Mao Zedong was surrounded by the welcoming crowd for nearly fifteen minutes.

At 5:10 PM, the open-top car finally drove into Xinhua Gate in Zhongnanhai and arrived at the Qin Zheng Palace. Chairman Voroshilov will stay here during his visit to Beijing.
