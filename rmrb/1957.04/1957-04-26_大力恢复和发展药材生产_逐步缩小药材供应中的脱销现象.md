    Xinhua News Agency, April 24th News: The National Conference on Traditional Chinese Medicinal Materials, which concluded today, determined that the primary task of the nationwide medicinal materials system in carrying out the campaign to increase production and practice economy this year is to actively cooperate with relevant departments to restore and develop the production of medicinal materials, fully utilize social forces to vigorously carry out purchasing work, improve business management, and gradually reduce the out-of-stock phenomenon in the supply of medicinal materials.
    In order to increase production and meet market needs, the conference requested that medicinal materials companies at all levels actively and proactively cooperate with relevant departments such as agriculture and forestry to do a good job in leading the production of medicinal materials. Difficult problems such as land, seeds, fertilizers, and funds required for the production of medicinal materials should be promptly reported to relevant departments and resolved as much as possible. In addition, attention should also be paid to gradually converting wild plants and animal medicinal materials into artificial cultivation and artificial breeding to increase the production of medicinal materials and expand sources of medicinal materials. The conference believes that it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the free market for traditional Chinese medicinal materials, reasonably control purchase prices, and organize forces in a timely manner to purchase according to the medicinal material production season. In addition to direct purchases and entrusted purchases by supply and marketing cooperatives, all available social forces should be fully utilized. In purchasing work, attention should be paid to carrying out publicity work, informing the masses of the medicines to be purchased, specifications, and prices, and guiding the masses to carry out harvesting in a planned manner.
    The conference pointed out that in the case of insufficient supply of medicinal materials and tight supply, the supply of medicinal materials should be based on the different uses of medicinal materials and the urgency of diseases, so that limited medicines are used for urgent and necessary aspects. Medicines mainly used for decoction pieces and processed medicines should be supplied first; medicines for treating diseases that are most harmful to the people should also be supplied first.
    The conference also requested its affiliated units to implement the policy of "running enterprises diligently and thriftily," rely on and mobilize the masses to improve business management, and save commodity circulation costs. It is also necessary to promptly summarize and promote experience in warehousing and storage work to prevent losses such as insect infestation, mold, and deterioration of commodities.
    The conference also announced the State Council's decision on "transferring the management of traditional Chinese medicinal materials business to the Ministry of Health" and requested that health administrative departments at all levels do a good job in the takeover work.
    This conference began on March 15th.

    大力恢复和发展药材生产
    逐步缩小药材供应中的脱销现象
    新华社24日讯　今天结束的全国中药材会议确定今年全国中药材系统开展增产节约运动的首要任务，是积极配合有关部门恢复和发展药材生产，充分利用社会力量大力开展收购工作，改进经营管理，逐步缩小药材供应的脱销现象。
    为了增加产量，满足市场需要，会议要求各级药材公司，积极主动的配合农业、林业等有关部门，做好药材生产的领导工作。药材生产中所需土地、籽种、肥料、资金等困难问题，要及时向有关部门反映，尽可能求得解决。此外，也要注意将野生的植物和动物药材，逐步转为人工培植和人工饲养，以增产药材和扩大药源。会议认为必须加强对中药材自由市场的领导，合理掌握收购价格，根据药材生产季节组织力量及时收购。除直接收购和委托供销社收购外，应充分利用一切可以利用的社会力量。在收购工作中，要注意开展宣传工作，把要采购的药品，规格、价格告诉群众，指导群众有计划地进行采挖。
    会议指出，在药材货源不足，供应紧张的情况下，药材供应要根据药材的不同用途和疾病的急缓，做到以有限的药品用于急需和必须的方面。以饮片配方和加工成药为主的药，应首先供应；治疗对人民危害最大的疾病的药也要尽先供应。
    会议还要求所属单位，贯彻“勤俭办企业”的方针依靠和发动群众改善经营管理，节约商品流转费用。并及时总结推广仓储保管工作经验，防止商品虫、霉、变质等损失。
    这个会议上还宣布了国务院关于“中药材业务划归卫生部管理”的决定，要求各级卫生行政部门作好接管工作。
    这次会议是在3月15日开始的。
