Since liberation, China's education has greatly developed. In 1949, there were only over 24 million primary school students, 1.26 million secondary school students, and 117,000 higher education students; currently, there are over 63 million primary school students, approximately 5.97 million secondary school students, and over 400,000 higher education students. However, due to the limitations of various conditions in our country, it is not yet possible to implement universal secondary education. As for higher education, it is inherently not within the scope of universal education, and its development is naturally subject to greater limitations. Therefore, a large proportion of primary and secondary school graduates must transfer to production. This is a matter of widespread concern to the people of the country.

Some people ask: Is it normal or abnormal that many senior primary and secondary school graduates cannot continue their education this year? Is it a long-term or temporary phenomenon? Is it a good thing or a bad thing? Will there be more students unable to continue their education in the future than this year? They say that there were errors in education work and blame the government for setting the education plan too low this year.

Yes, there were shortcomings and errors in the education work last year. One important error was that more students were enrolled last year, which brought many difficulties to the work. However, it cannot be said that if fewer students had been enrolled last year, it would have been possible to enroll more students this year. We believe that the current situation, where the majority of high school graduates continue their education while a small proportion do not, and where a small proportion of junior high and senior primary school graduates continue their education while the majority do not, is a normal phenomenon. In contrast, the situation in the past year and several preceding years, where almost all high school graduates continued their education, and the majority of junior high graduates continued their education while a small proportion did not, was a temporary phenomenon, a special phenomenon produced by the special conditions of secondary education not keeping pace with the development needs of higher education and the growth in the number of high school graduates failing to adapt to the enrollment needs of higher education. The changing situation indicates that our country's education is beginning to transition to a more normal state. Therefore, this newly emerged situation this year will continue to develop in the future, and this situation will be a long-term phenomenon, not a temporary one. Our task in the future is to first gradually universalize primary education, ensuring that all school-age children are enrolled. If this goal is achieved, with approximately 100 million primary school students nationwide, there will be over 10 million primary school graduates each year. While gradually universalizing primary education, we will continue to develop junior high, high school, and university education. However, over a long period in the future, the general trend will be that more and more primary and secondary school graduates will be unable to continue their education and must participate in production. In the future, on the one hand, more and more primary, junior high, and high school graduates will continue their education year by year; on the other hand, more and more primary, junior high, and high school graduates will be投入entering production labor year by year. What does this indicate? It indicates that the number of intellectuals in our country will increase, and the cultural level of our people will gradually improve. Undoubtedly, this is a good thing, not a bad thing, for the country, the people, and education itself.

Currently, students who are graduating this year across the country are very nervous. They are concentrating their efforts on preparing for entrance examinations, and teachers in each school are working hard to help students prepare for entrance examinations. This effort is completely justified. School authorities and Party and government leaders should help, not hinder, their efforts. However, graduating students, as well as their teachers, and especially their parents, should have two plans for their future: one for continuing education and one for not continuing education. It would be great if they can continue their education. But if they cannot, they should be fully prepared mentally, seeing it as an ordinary thing, not as something "terrible" or "shameful." There should be no discrimination against students who cannot continue their education, and their future should be actively arranged. Arranging the future of graduates who are not continuing their education is currently a relatively arduous task. Every graduate's family should seriously cooperate with the state, and the state should also seriously cooperate with these families. Our country implements the policy of "overall planning, taking all factors into consideration, and appropriate arrangements" for all the people in the country. Therefore, it is entirely necessary for Party and government organs and youth organizations in various regions to adopt a responsible attitude towards local middle and primary school graduates who cannot continue their education, and to make overall arrangements based on their individual circumstances.

The question is: how to arrange it? What should they do? Adopting methods such as people in urban and rural areas collectively running schools to establish more primary and secondary schools, or organizing students to study on their own through self-study groups and remedial classes to prepare for future participation in production labor or further education, is one type of arrangement. However, this can ultimately only solve the problem for a small number of people, and whether they study on their own or attend people-run primary and secondary schools, they will still need to find employment in the future. Therefore, the most important method is to help students who cannot continue their education find employment. Then, what kind of employment? As everyone knows, state organs, institutions, and enterprises are now streamlining their structures and adjusting their personnel. Within one or two years, although these organs and units may recruit some employees from demobilized soldiers, secondary vocational schools, and some high school graduates, and some enterprises may recruit some apprentices, the numbers will not be large, but rather small. In addition, certain service industries in some cities (such as barbering, tailoring, and catering) and certain handicrafts still need to increase a small number of apprentices and employees. However, nationally speaking, the place that can accommodate the most people is the countryside, and the aspect that can accommodate the most people is agriculture. Therefore, engaging in agriculture is the main direction for arranging the employment of primary and secondary school graduates in the future, and it is also their main avenue for employment in the future. Therefore, in this article, we intend to focus on discussing this aspect of the issue.

Some people worry that our rural labor force is surplus and that students will have nothing to do when they return to the countryside. Facts have proven that in the northeast, northwest, and all rural areas with more land than people after the basic realization of cooperativization, there is indeed a need for labor. Even in rural areas in other general regions, as long as they begin to implement agricultural technological reforms and organize diversified rural operations, they will feel a lack of educated labor. Some people may have seen that in the past few years, a large number of primary school graduates and secondary school graduates entered industrial production, while only a large number of primary school graduates and very few junior high graduates, or even no high school graduates, entered agricultural production, and therefore believe that agriculture only needs primary school graduates and does not need secondary school graduates. This view is also incorrect. Because the fact is not that agriculture does not need secondary school graduates, but that the number of secondary school graduates was small at that time, and it could only first meet the needs of higher education and industrial production, and it was not possible to arrange secondary school graduates for agriculture. The situation is different now. The number of secondary school graduates has increased. When arranging employment for secondary school graduates, we are now able to consider both the needs of industrial production and the needs of agricultural production, and, for a certain period, may be able to focus on taking care of the needs of agricultural production.

If there is an objective need and also a possibility, then are there no problems with middle and primary school graduates, especially secondary school graduates, going to the countryside to farm and participate in agricultural production? No, there are still problems. The problem lies in thinking, in the fact that political education and ideological work in schools have the shortcomings of being divorced from reality and divorced from the masses, and have not guided students to truly and fully understand this objective need and possibility. In the past, education administrative departments did not pay enough attention to labor education, and did not pay enough attention to educating middle and primary school students on the need to participate in industrial and agricultural production after graduation. Although this was strengthened for a time in 1953-54, it was somewhat relaxed afterwards. Even when labor education was strengthened for a time, general principles were often discussed, with little connection to concrete reality. As a result, many problems in students' thinking have not been resolved, erroneous views have not been criticized, and correct views have not been truly established. Therefore, a considerable number of students are emotionally resistant to going to the countryside to farm, and their attitude is passive. Of course, as long as ideological education work is done well, these can all be changed.

First, some people say that going to the countryside to farm is "shameful" and "unpromising." Some young people verbally admit that labor is glorious, but when they are asked to engage in concrete labor such as farming, they think it is "shameful." Recently, some people have been saying that "farmers' lives are hard," but when they are asked to send themselves or their children to the countryside to help farmers develop production and improve their lives, they say it is "unpromising." Saying that farming is "shameful" and "unpromising" means saying that farming is "lowly" and "not glorious." This statement is completely wrong. Many young students' parents are farmers. Can it be said that their parents are ashamed? Many people have been farmers for generations. Can it be said that their ancestors were ashamed for generations? The total agricultural population of the country is over 500 million. Can it be said that they are ashamed? Isn't this an insult to the more than 500 million farmers in the country? The country has a total of 600 million people. Is it okay to say that the labor of more than 500 million people is "shameful," "lowly," "unpromising," and "not glorious"? What kind of viewpoint is this? Is it the viewpoint of the working people? Is it the viewpoint of the proletariat? Is it the viewpoint of Marxism? None of them. This is the viewpoint of "all professions are inferior, only studying is superior," the viewpoint of feudal scholar-officials, the viewpoint of feudal aristocrats, and also the viewpoint of the bourgeoisie.

Because of this viewpoint, or influenced by this viewpoint, great confusion has arisen in the thinking of many young people, and there are many inconsistencies in their words and deeds. They verbally value labor, but in reality, they only value mental labor and not physical labor; they verbally say they look up to laborers, but in reality, they only look up to mental laborers and look down on physical laborers. They abstractly recite the points that labor creates material wealth and spiritual civilization, and that labor creates humanity and human history, but in reality, they do not recognize or understand that human physical labor is the foundation of mental labor, and do not recognize or understand that human productive activity is the most basic practical activity and the thing that determines other activities. They also divide labor and laborers into ranks, believing that mental labor is "one level higher" than physical labor, and that mental laborers "should" stand above physical laborers. Therefore, they want to be mental laborers and do not want to be physical laborers. If this goal cannot be achieved, they will reluctantly become workers in large industries, but they do not want to be apprentices, do not want to be handicraft workers, do not want to be barbers, tailors, or cooks, and especially do not want to be farmers.

As everyone knows, in the near future, our country will universalize primary education and achieve the task of eliminating illiteracy. Later, we will spend more time universalizing junior high education, and even high school education, so that the cultural level of the people throughout the country will generally be raised to the level of junior high or even high school graduates. After forty years of effort, the Soviet Union has already completed universal compulsory education equivalent to our country's junior high school, and is now beginning to implement universal compulsory high school education. Some socialist countries in Eastern Europe, as well as some capitalist countries, have also achieved universal compulsory junior high education. In these countries, the relatively younger workers and farmers, and the relatively younger barbers, tailors, cooks, etc., are all secondary school graduates. Then, can we imagine that after the people in our country all become junior high graduates or high school graduates, everyone will be mental laborers, not physical laborers, not workers or apprentices, not farmers, not barbers, tailors, or cooks? Probably no one can imagine that, right? Since secondary school graduates in the Soviet Union now, and secondary school graduates in our country in the future, except for a portion who continue their education, will all be workers and farmers, then why can secondary school graduates in our country now only all continue their education, and not a small portion continue their education, while the majority become workers and apprentices, become farmers, become barbers, tailors, cooks, etc.?

The opposition between mental labor and physical labor is a long-standing fact in class societies. In the Soviet Union, the economic basis for the opposition between mental labor and physical labor has long been eliminated, and therefore the opposition between mental labor and physical labor has been eliminated. After our country basically completed the socialist transformation, it also basically eliminated the economic basis for the opposition between mental labor and physical labor, as well as the opposition between the two. The great future of the Soviet Union, China, and the world is communism. It can be imagined that at that time, everyone will receive a university education (the university of the future will not be exactly the same as the university of the present), everyone will be a university graduate, and everyone will be a mental laborer and at the same time a physical laborer. However, can we say that after the basic differences between mental labor and physical labor are eliminated, there will no longer be a need for the division of labor, no longer be a need for workers and farmers, no longer be a need for barbers, tailors, cooks, etc.? We cannot say that. Since communist society will still need these divisions of labor, and it will not be "shameful" for university graduates in communist society to do these things, then why do we think it is "shameful" and "unpromising" to arrange for secondary school graduates to farm, to cut hair, to sew clothes, and to cook, according to the division of labor necessary for society?

Many young people, after reading until junior high school or high school graduation, look down on workers and farmers, look down on barbers, tailors, and cooks, and think that they are "one level higher" than workers, apprentices, and farmers, and "one level higher" than barbers, tailors, and cooks. After reading a few books, they are not more humble, but more arrogant; they do not respect physical laborers more, but look down on physical laborers more. A female student wrote in a letter: "It is outrageous to have young, fair-skinned girls go to the countryside to farm, to carry dirt, and to carry manure." The working people use their labor to raise their children and send them to school to study, but the children, after studying, say that farming, carrying dirt, and carrying manure are "outrageous." What use is it to the working people to cultivate young people in this way? Wouldn't it be more beneficial to the cause of the working people to teach fewer people who hold this erroneous attitude? These phenomena fully demonstrate that, due to China's cultural backwardness and the small number of intellectuals, and especially due to the weak and unrealistic political education in schools, today's young students are far from shaking off the influence of the deep-rooted arrogance and self-importance that Chinese intellectuals have always had, to the point that they have been educated in schools in New China for many years and still do not understand how to respect labor and the working people, and even put on airs in front of the working people. As Comrade Mao Zedong said:

"There are many intellectuals who think they have a lot of knowledge and put on intellectual airs, but they don't know that these airs are bad, harmful, and hindering their progress. They should know one truth, that many so-called intellectuals are actually relatively the most ignorant, and sometimes the knowledge of workers and peasants is a little more than theirs."

Therefore, Comrade Mao Zedong "advises those who only have book knowledge but have not yet come into contact with reality, or those who have little practical experience, to understand their shortcomings and be more humble in their attitude."

Therefore, middle and primary school graduates who have already gained a certain amount of book knowledge should resolutely, happily, and actively devote themselves to productive labor, especially to agricultural production, to gain practical knowledge of production struggles, and to combine book knowledge with practical knowledge to promote their own improvement and development.

For this purpose, we must first get rid of the various erroneous views and ideas mentioned above and change the above-mentioned erroneous attitudes and styles. If we have such views ourselves, we should first correct them ourselves; if others have such views, we should help them correct them. This is the proper attitude of progressive young people pursuing progress. To propagate such views to others ourselves, or to hear others propagate such views without resolutely refuting them, is a manifestation of ideological backwardness and political backwardness. If Party and government leaders, teachers, staff, and youth workers in schools, students' parents, especially students' parents who are state employees, hear such views being spread everywhere and rampant among young students without organizing debates or conducting education and criticism, it shows that their ideological work is weak and their political understanding is not high. Recently, various places have paid attention to labor education, which is of course good. However, if we do not combine it with the Marxist view of labor and focus on resolving the fundamental question of "is farming shameful or not, is it promising or not," if we still abstractly recite principles and tenets as in the past without connecting them to reality, then it is certain that nothing can be solved. Our comrades often say that it is necessary to strengthen the ideological education work of young people and that ideological education should be linked to reality. But if we do not properly educate students by linking it to the big practical problem and political problem that commonly exists among students, "is farming shameful or not, is it promising or not," isn't that "going south by driving the chariot north"?

Second, some people say that going to the countryside to farm has "no future." This statement is another manifestation of looking down on labor and looking down on farmers; on the other hand, to a large extent, it is also related to their lack of understanding of what position agriculture occupies in the national economy and what role farmers play in socialist construction.

Industry is the leading force in all sectors of the national economy, and agricultural development is the foundation for industrial development. The resolution of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China on the political report pointed out: "Agriculture has extremely important and multifaceted influences on the cause of industrialization. The development of agriculture not only directly affects the level of people's lives and the speed of light industry development, but also affects the speed of heavy industry development." Therefore, we must strive to greatly develop agricultural production. In order to develop agricultural production, it is necessary to carry out social reform and technical reform in agriculture. After the basic completion of agricultural cooperativization nationwide, there is still some work to be done in social reform, but this work can be completed soon. The main task in the future is to manage agricultural cooperatives well, gradually and appropriately carry out technical reforms, and greatly develop agricultural production. It must be understood that managing an agricultural production cooperative with hundreds of households is not easier than managing a factory with hundreds of people. To manage the hundreds of thousands of agricultural cooperatives across the country well, and to realize the great technical reform of agriculture in our country, we still need to carry out a lot of hard work.

The draft agricultural development program is a long-term plan for our country to carry out agricultural technical reform and rural construction. It presents the first great vision of agricultural development in our country to the people of the whole country, and it has become a great source of encouragement for farmers across the country. After this program is realized, we will continue to implement similar second and third programs to realize the mechanization, electrification, and scientification of agriculture in our country. Young people who are now twenty years old have every possibility of seeing the countryside in our country become a truly prosperous and truly happy countryside.

Land reform and agricultural cooperativization are two historical and fundamental reforms in our country's countryside. The countryside after cooperativization is a new countryside, and the farmers are new farmers, but the current countryside and farmers still lack culture. In order to do a good job in the operation and management of agricultural cooperatives, and in order to gradually carry out the technical reform of agriculture, the countryside urgently needs culture, and farmers themselves need to improve their culture. At the same time, it also needs cultured people to be farmers. In addition to a large number of primary school graduates participating in agricultural production, if, starting from this year, nearly one million or even more than one million secondary school graduates go to the countryside every year, and four million to five million secondary school graduates participate in agricultural production within five years, and more and more secondary school graduates go to the countryside year by year in the future, and closely combine with the masses of farmers in productive labor, then it can be affirmed that the operation and management of agricultural cooperatives and the technical reform of agriculture will receive a great impetus, and will promote another fundamental reform in our country's countryside—technical reform, and promote the unprecedented great development of agricultural production in our country.

Some students are willing to work in the countryside, but they want to be cadres and are unwilling to farm. It is true that the current countryside and agricultural cooperatives need some cadres, such as accountants, clerks, etc. However, we advise students who go to the countryside to not be accountants or cadres in the beginning, nor should they necessarily learn those special agricultural technologies, but to first farm, to farm honestly and diligently, to learn from experienced old farmers. After three to five years, they should learn the most common and largest type of agricultural production knowledge in the country—farming knowledge, and truly become a glorious laboring farmer, learning everything that ordinary farmers can do and know. It must be known that although students who have just gone down have culture, they are not yet true farmers, they do not yet have the skills of farmers, and they have not yet obtained the qualifications of farmers. They will be better off learning special agricultural technology knowledge or becoming cadres after they have truly learned the agricultural production knowledge that the vast majority of farmers know. Otherwise, they will lack the most basic knowledge that the vast majority of farmers know, which will be detrimental to their future development.

At the same time, we advise all young students who go to the countryside to carefully manage their relationship with the masses of farmers. To this end, they should not adopt an arrogant attitude of "disliking everything" in the countryside and indiscriminately criticizing everything. After going to the countryside, they should always think about helping others, and when getting along with others, they should not take advantage of others and should not be afraid of suffering a little loss themselves, so that they can truly become friends of the farmers. They should adopt an attitude of learning and helping to treat rural cadres; they should look at their shortcomings and strengths more, and they should look at them comprehensively; they should kindly help them overcome those shortcomings that have already been identified, so that they can become friends of the cadres.

In this way, students who go to the countryside and the original farmers will be integrated and work together as one; their book knowledge and practical knowledge can be combined with each other and used for each other. At that time, when talking about farming, they will be the same as the original farmers; when talking about culture, they will be higher than the original farmers; when talking about politics, their relationship with other farmers will be very good. In this way, they themselves will truly become the first generation of cultured new-style farmers in China, and the masses of farmers will trust them. As everyone knows, the management organs of state organs and cooperatives are all democratically elected. At that time, as long as they are truly trusted and supported by the people and are capable people, they will have the opportunity to be elected by the people as people's representatives, as cadres of cooperatives, and as cadres of state organs. And such cadres are truly emerging from the masses, not forcibly placed down from above. Of course, our labor is for the progress of the entire society, not to earn a certain position for individuals, such as being a cadre, etc. Being a cadre is the same as being a farmer, it is to serve the people, but after all, this is only the work of a small number of people, and it is not a profession that can remain unchanged for life. But in any case, the older generation in state organs and institutions at all levels will always be replaced by young people. Those young people who truly come from workers and farmers, can endure hardships, have culture, have the ability to work, and have gained the trust and support of the people, that is to say, those young people who are both virtuous and talented, are of course most likely to take over the older generation.

It is said that among some students, because they think they cannot continue their education and have to go to the countryside to farm, negative emotions have arisen in their studies. They say: "What's the use of learning culture if you go to the countryside to dig up clods of earth? What's the use of learning geometry and trigonometry?" These emotions are not good, and these statements are wrong. As mentioned earlier, the countryside urgently needs cultured people, and the more cultural knowledge they have, the greater the use they will be to the countryside. Secondary education is general education, and it gives people a kind of general knowledge. Whoever masters this knowledge lays the foundation for further study, and they can then improve their cultural and technical level step by step through their own efforts. Geometry and trigonometry, physics and chemistry, although knowledge in these areas may not all be directly useful for farming immediately, learning these sciences makes it easier to accept new agricultural technologies, and these common scientific knowledge will often be used in future study and practical work and practical life. Generally speaking, mastering preliminary common scientific knowledge not only makes people's knowledge broad, exercises people's minds, and makes people's thinking and language more accurate and more organized, but also enables people to develop a scientific and materialistic view of nature and break away from the superstitious state of natural phenomena. Therefore, all students in school, whether they are graduating or not, whether they can continue their education or not, should continue to study hard, study seriously, and learn all their subjects well, until they graduate, obtain a diploma, or continue their education, or enter a factory, or join a certain industry to learn a craft, or happily go to the countryside. And after participating in production, they should also use their spare time and slack farming time to continue their studies, studying different subjects according to their different interests and the different needs of the country. They can study Marxism-Leninism, they can study science and technology, and they can also study literature and art. The organizational forms of learning can be diverse. Some study on their own, some form mutual aid groups, some organize spare-time schools, some enter night universities or correspondence schools, and some can also enter training classes in the future, and those who have joined the Party can also enter Party schools, and those who produce well and study well may also enter universities. Therefore, young people must never stop their studies after participating in industrial and agricultural production.

Some people say that if they do not enter university and go to the countryside to farm, they will no longer be able to become experts. This is also not necessarily true. The problem is not mainly in the university or in the countryside, but whether one's own attitude is correct and whether one's own efforts are tenacious. Not everyone who graduates from university is a scientist, and not everyone who is a scientist is a university graduate. Michurin was a great agricultural scientist, but he never went to university; Gorky was a great writer, but he never even went to primary school. The famous scientist, writer, and politician Franklin, and the famous physicist Faraday, were both apprentices. The famous inventors Edison and Nobel only attended primary school for a very short time. Many such examples can be cited. Therefore, our middle school graduates who go to the countryside to farm, as long as they work hard and persist in self-study, can still become experts or scientists. As for politicians or political workers, it can be said that going to the countryside to farm, or entering a factory to work, or joining different industries to learn a craft, will only make it more possible to train themselves into excellent politicians or political workers. For example, among the members of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and leaders at all levels, only a few are university students, and the vast majority have only attended middle school or primary school, and some have not even attended primary school. Therefore, can we say that the future of middle school graduates entering university is definitely better than going to the countryside? We cannot say that. Can we say that the things that can be learned by going to the countryside are definitely less than those learned by entering university? We cannot say that either.

People know that our Party Central Committee and local Party committees at all levels, except for urban Party committees and individual provincial Party committees, place their main strength in the countryside. Now, all regions and levels across the country are streamlining their structures, transferring cadres, and delegating power layer by layer to the countryside. Tens of thousands of cadres eat, live, and labor with the farmers, some county heads carry manure baskets, and some county Party secretaries carry manure. People also know that more than 500 million farmers across the country are working diligently and actively producing under the leadership of the Party and the government, striving for a bumper harvest this year and striving to build a socialist new countryside. Is it possible that the whole country, from top to bottom, from leaders to the masses, attaches so much importance to rural work and the agricultural economy because they are doing a business with no future? No, they are all doing a business with a great future. Since the countryside has a great future, why do we say that students who go to the countryside have no future? In the new society, every cause that benefits the people has a future, and everyone who is loyal to the interests of the people has a future. The first generation of cultured new-style farmers in China, this is the future of students who go to the countryside to farm, and this future is bright and great, but it can only be achieved after arduous efforts and training. Farming requires sweating and enduring hardships, which is much more difficult than verbally talking about the glory of labor, but the benefits it brings to the people are incomparably greater than any nice words.

Third, some people say that they are willing to go to the countryside to farm, but they must go to counties and townships outside of their own, and they are unwilling to return to their own county and township. They say that there is a kind of social pressure that makes it difficult for them to live in their own hometown. Their parents, brothers, relatives, friends, teachers, and classmates still, to varying degrees, hold the view of looking down on agriculture and looking down on farmers, and are unwilling for their children to return home to farm. They also believe that having read books for more than ten years and still carrying a hoe and following behind a cow's butt is "unpromising." Their cold words make it unbearable for students who go to the countryside to farm. That farmers themselves look down on themselves is a burden that the feudal ruling class has placed on them for thousands of years, and we have a responsibility to help them remove this burden. As long as this burden is removed, the social pressure on students returning to their hometowns to farm will also be removed. Therefore, while we are carrying out ideological education for the vast number of young students, in the cities and in the countryside, we must focus on carrying out extensive and in-depth publicity and education work for students' parents and friends, for the vast number of farmers and cadres, so that they have a correct understanding of agricultural production, the masses of farmers, and students returning to their hometowns, so that they adopt an attitude of warm care, encourage students to return to their hometowns, welcome students to return to their hometowns, and enable students who go to the countryside to settle down in the countryside and settle down in farming.

It must be pointed out here: people's thinking can be changed, but it cannot be changed well overnight. Young people who go to the countryside should be mentally prepared and should stand firm and firmly understand. They should not be afraid of sarcasm and ridicule, and should not be afraid of cold words. When others say that farming is "shameful," they should righteously say that farming is not shameful; when others say that farming is "unpromising," they should say that it is very promising for the country and the people. They should patiently explain to people, reason with them, and not waver or be arrogant. They should use their actions to convince people and influence people, and if they persist in this way for years and months, people will be convinced of them and respect them.

Finally, some people say that if they cannot continue their education and have to go to farm, they have "suffered a loss." Recently, there have indeed been some people who are excessively enthusiastic about personal fame and gain, pursuing things that pay more, have better benefits, and are more relaxed, and are unwilling to do things that have lower wages, fewer benefits, or are more difficult, even if these things are very needed by the country and the people. This is an evil wind. It has indeed knocked down some people and is still attracting a portion of people. The state should adjust the unreasonable aspects of the treatment of certain people in order to regulate the lives of all sections of the people. However, we hope that young people can stand firm in front of this evil wind and not follow it.

Before the victory of the Chinese revolution, Chinese Communists and many revolutionaries were not afraid of being beheaded or imprisoned. They left their hometowns and ran around, not caring about fame or gain, not seeking enjoyment, and only thought about the survival of the country and the welfare of the people. In order to win the revolutionary cause, they bravely sacrificed and fought arduously. When those in front fell, those behind immediately followed; when the revolution failed, they immediately reorganized and continued to fight. These people, with great revolutionary spirit and a spirit of self-sacrifice, were regarded as "rebellious" by the reactionary rulers in the past, and were also regarded as "fools" by some so-called "smart people" who only cared about personal interests and not the interests of the people, and only asked about personal futures and not the future of the country. However, the conclusion of history is fair. The revolution relied on these "fools" and the efforts of the broad masses of people to achieve victory throughout the country, the counter-revolution was overthrown, the "smart people" of that time either later came to the side of the people due to the lessons of reality, or were abandoned by the people. And all the martyrs who sacrificed themselves in the revolution are now respected by the people throughout the country and will be admired by the people for thousands of generations.

Then, are such "fools" still needed in the period of socialist construction? Our ideals are beautiful, and our journey is difficult. All aspects of the country's construction need more of these "fools" and need to further develop this kind of "foolish energy." It is worth noting that some of our cadres and some of our young people have recently gradually forgotten this fine tradition, and some so-called "smart people" of the new era have appeared among them. When allocating work, these people first think not of the needs of the motherland, but of their personal future; when they encounter difficulties, they first think not of ways to overcome them themselves, but reach out to the state to make demands. They are irresponsible for their work, picking easy jobs and fearing hard ones, pushing heavy burdens onto others and picking light ones for themselves. They first plan for themselves before anything else. They are meticulous about their personal status and personal treatment, not comparing themselves to others in terms of hardship or work, but comparing themselves in terms of status and extravagance, and some have even developed to the point of vying for fame and gain and being greedy for profit. The six big words in the depths of these people's souls are: grab for gain and fear loss.

We want to advise all cadres and all young people not to learn from these "smart people," but to learn from those "fools," not to be afraid of suffering, and not to be afraid of suffering a little loss themselves. It must be understood that people who only want to gain and are afraid of suffering losses are ideologically and politically unhealthy and are not worthy of trust. And people who are not afraid of suffering losses for the sake of the interests of the country and the people are noble, moral, detached from low-level interests, truly have ideals, can stand on their feet, and can gain the trust of the people. In the long run, the former will ultimately suffer a great loss, while the latter will ultimately receive the treatment they deserve. It must be understood that in order to have a good relationship with the masses, one cannot take advantage and should not be afraid of suffering losses oneself. To complete any great cause, one must have the spirit of hard work and must consciously take on the more difficult and arduous work. If you do this once or twice, people may not pay attention, if you do it ten or eight times, people may still see him as a "fool," but if you do this for ten years, twenty years, for a long time, people will say that he is a good person and will trust and support him. Suffering first and enjoying later is the basic condition for gaining the trust of the Party and the people. We hope that young people can all train themselves in this direction and train themselves to become people with the virtue of "being the first to worry about the affairs of the country and the last to enjoy its pleasures." Young people must have ideals, and we hope that all young

### 关于中小学毕业生参加农业生产问题

    关于中小学毕业生参加农业生产问题
    解放以后，我国的教育事业有了很大的发展。一九四九年只有小学生二千四百多万，中等学校学生一百二十六万，高等学校学生十一万七千；而目前已经有小学生六千三百多万，中等学校学生约五百九十七万，高等学校学生四十万以上。但是由于我国各种条件的限制，现在还没有可能实行普及中学教育。至于高等教育，本来不属于普及教育的范围，它的发展当然要受更多的限制。因此，小学毕业生和中学毕业生都要有很大的部分转入生产。这是一个现在全国人民普遍关心的问题。
    有人问：今年有许多高小毕业生和中学毕业生不能升学，是正常现象还是不正常现象？是长期现象还是暂时现象？是好事情还是坏事情？今后不能升学的学生会比今年更多还是更少？他们说教育工作方面犯了错误，他们责备政府今年的教育计划订得过低。
    是的，去年在教育工作上是有缺点和错误的，其中一项重要的错误就是去年多招了一部分学生，给工作带来了不少的困难。但是，不能说，去年不多招一部分学生，今年就可能招更多的学生。我们认为，今年高中毕业生大部分升学、小部分不升学，初中和高小毕业生小部分升学、大部分不升学的情况，是正常现象。而去年和前几年，高中毕业生几乎全部升学，初中毕业生大部分升学、小部分不升学的情况，却是一种临时性的现象，是中等教育赶不上高等教育发展需要，高中毕业生数量增长未能适应高等学校招生需要的特殊条件所产生的一种特殊现象。情况的变化，表明我国的教育事业已经开始转入比较正常的状态。因此，今年新出现的这种情况，今后还会有所发展，这种情况将是长期现象，而不是暂时现象。我们今后的任务，是首先逐步普及小学教育，使学龄儿童全部入学。如果达到了这个目的，全国约有一亿小学生，每年就将有一千多万小学毕业生。在逐步普及小学教育的同时，我们将继续发展初中教育、高中教育和大学教育。但是，在今后一个很长的时间内，总的趋势将是有更多的小学和中学毕业生不能升学，必须参加生产。在今后，一方面，将一年比一年，有更多的小学毕业生、初中毕业生、高中毕业生升学；另一方面，又将一年比一年，有越来越多的小学毕业生、初中毕业生、高中毕业生投入生产劳动。这表明什么呢？表明我国的知识分子将愈来愈多，我国人民的文化水平将逐步有所提高。毫无疑问，这对于国家、对于人民、对于教育事业本身，都是好事情，而不是坏事情。
    现在全国各地今年应届毕业的学生情绪都很紧张，他们正在集中精力准备升学的考试，各校教师也在努力帮助学生准备升学的考试。这种努力是完全正当的。各校当局和党政领导都应当帮助、而不应当妨碍他们的这种努力。但是应届毕业的学生，以及他们的教师，特别是他们的家长，对于他们的出路都应当有升学和不能升学两种打算。能够升学，那很好。而如果不能升学，也应当有充分的精神准备，要看作是普通的事情，不要看作是“不得了”、“不能见人”的事情。对于不能升学的学生，不应当有任何歧视，而应当积极安排他们的出路。安排不升学的毕业生的出路，在目前是一个比较繁重的任务，各个毕业生的家庭都应当认真同国家合作，国家也应当认真同这些家庭合作。我们的国家对全国所有的人都实行“统筹兼顾，适当安排”的方针，因此，各地党政机关和青年组织对于当地不能升学的中小学毕业生，采取负责的态度，分别情况，作好统筹安排，是完全必要的。
    问题是：如何安排？安排他们做什么？采用城乡人民集体办学等办法，再办一些小学、中学，或者采用自学小组和补习班等办法，组织学生自学，为日后参加生产劳动或升学准备条件，这是一种安排。但是这究竟只能解决很少数人的问题，而且无论自学，或者进民办的中小学，以后也还是要就业。因此，最主要的办法还是帮助不能升学的学生就业。那末，就什么业呢？大家知道，国家机关、事业机关和企业单位现在都在精简机构，调整人员，一二年内，这些机关和单位虽然可能从复员军人、中等专业学校和一部分高中毕业生中招收一些职工，一部分企业可能招收一些学徒，但是数量不会很多，而是很少。此外，某些城市里的服务行业（例如理发、成衣、饮食等）和某些手工业，还需要增加一小部分学徒和职工。但是，就全国说来，最能够容纳人的地方是农村，容纳人最多的方面是农业。所以，从事农业是今后安排中小学毕业生的主要方向，也是他们今后就业的主要途径。因此，在这篇文章里，我们准备着重地讨论一下这一方面的问题。
    有人担心我们的农村劳动力过剩，担心学生回到农村无事可做。事实证明，合作化基本实现以后的农村，在地多人少的东北、西北，以及一切还有较多荒地的农村，固然需要劳动力；就是在其他一般地区的农村中，只要那里开始进行了农业的技术改革，开始组织了农村的多种经营，那里就会感到有文化的劳动力的缺乏。有人也许看到过去几年，有大批小学毕业生和中学毕业生投入工业生产，而投入农业生产的只有大批小学毕业生，很少初中毕业生，甚至没有高中毕业生，因而认为农业方面只需要小学毕业生，不需要中学毕业生。这种看法也是不对的。因为事实上不是农业方面不需要中学毕业生，而是因为当时的中学毕业生数量少，只能首先满足高等学校和工业生产的需要，还不可能给农业方面安排中学毕业生。现在情况不同了。中学毕业生增加了。我们在安排中学毕业生就业的时候，已经有可能兼顾工业生产和农业生产的需要，并且在一定时期内有可能着重地照顾农业生产的需要了。
    客观上有需要，也有可能，那末，中小学毕业生特别是中学毕业生，下乡种地，参加农业生产，是不是没有问题了呢？不，还是有问题的。问题在于思想，在于学校中的政治教育和思想工作存在着脱离实际、脱离群众的缺点，没有引导学生去切实地充分地认识这种客观上的需要和可能。过去教育行政部门对劳动教育重视不够，对中小学学生毕业后应当参加工农业生产的教育重视不够，1953—54年虽然曾经一度加强，但以后又有些放松。即在一度加强劳动教育的时候，也是一般道理讲得多，具体实际联系少。因而学生思想上有许多问题没有得到解决，错误观点没有受到批判，正确观点没有真正树立；因而现在相当多数的学生对下乡种地在情绪上是有抵触的，他们的态度是消极的。当然，只要思想教育工作作得好，这些又都是可以改变的。
    首先，有人说，下乡种地“丢人”，“没出息”。有些青年口头上承认劳动光荣，可是让他们去从事种地这种具体劳动的时候，就认为是“丢人”。最近又有人在说“农民生活苦”，可是要他们自己或他们的子弟下乡，去帮助农民发展生产、改善生活的时候，就说是“没出息”。说种地“丢人”，“没出息”，就是说种地“下贱”，“不光荣”。这种说法是完全错误的。许多青年学生的父母是种地的，难道能说他们的父母丢了人吗？许多人祖祖辈辈是种地的，难道能说他们祖祖辈辈丢了人吗？全国农业人口共五亿多，难道能说他们丢了人吗？这不是侮辱全国的五亿多农民吗？全国共有六亿人民，说其中五亿多人民的劳动是“丢人”的，“下贱”的，“没出息”的，“不光荣”的，这还了得吗？这是一种什么观点呢？是劳动人民的观点吗？是无产阶级的观点吗？是马克思主义的观点吗？都不是。这是“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”的观点，是封建士大夫的观点，是封建贵族的观点，也是资产阶级的观点。
    由于有这种观点，或者受了这种观点的影响，许多青年的思想发生了很大的混乱，他们的言行出现了很多不一致的地方。他们口头上重视劳动，实际上却只重视脑力劳动，而不重视体力劳动；口头上说看得起劳动者，实际上却只看得起脑力劳动者，而看不起体力劳动者。他们抽象地背诵劳动创造物质财富和精神文明、劳动创造人类和人类历史的论点，实际上却不承认或不了解人类的体力劳动是脑力劳动的基础，不承认或不了解人类的生产活动是最基本的实践活动，是决定其他活动的东西。他们也把劳动和劳动者分成等级，认为脑力劳动比体力劳动“高一等”，脑力劳动者“应当”站在体力劳动者之上。所以，他们想作脑力劳动者，不愿作体力劳动者。如果这个目的达不到，他们将就着去作大工业的工人，不愿作学徒，不愿作手工业工人，不愿作理发工人、缝衣工人、厨师，尤其不愿作农民。
    大家知道，在不久的将来，我国就要普及小学教育，并且实现扫除文盲的任务。以后，我们还要用更多的时间来普及初中教育，以至高中教育，使全国人民的文化水平普遍地提高到初中以至高中毕业的程度。苏联经过四十年的努力，已经完成相当于我国初中的普及义务教育，现在正在开始实行高中的普及义务教育。东欧有些社会主义国家，以及有些资本主义国家，也都实现了初中的普及义务教育。在这些国家内，比较年青的工人和农民，比较年青的理发工人、缝衣工人、厨师等等，都是中学毕业生。那末，能不能设想，在我国人民都成了初中毕业生、高中毕业生以后，人人都去作脑力劳动者，不作体力劳动者，不当工人和学徒，不当农民，不当理发工人、缝衣工人、厨师呢？大概谁也不能这样设想吧。既然苏联现在的中学毕业生，我国将来的中学毕业生，除开一部分人升学以外，都要作工人和农民，那末为什么我国现在的中学毕业生，却只能全部升学，而不能小部分升学，大部分去作工人和学徒，作农民，作理发工人、缝衣工人、厨师等等呢？
    脑力劳动和体力劳动的对立，是阶级社会里面长期存在的事实。在苏联，早已消灭了脑力劳动和体力劳动对立的经济基础，因而消灭了脑力劳动和体力劳动的对立。我国基本上完成社会主义改造以后，也基本上消灭了脑力劳动和体力劳动对立的经济基础以及两者之间的对立。苏联、中国和全世界的伟大前途，是共产主义。可以设想，到那个时候，人人都将受到大学教育（将来的大学同现在的大学不会完全一样），人人都将是大学毕业生，人人都将是脑力劳动者同时又是体力劳动者。但是，能不能说，在消灭了脑力劳动和体力劳动的基本差别以后，就不再需要劳动的分工，不再需要工人农民，不再需要理发工人、缝衣工人、厨师等等呢？不能这样说。既然共产主义社会都还需要这些劳动分工，共产主义社会的大学毕业生去作这些事，都不“丢人”；那末，我们现在按照社会所必需的劳动分工，安排中学毕业生去种地，去理发，去缝衣服，去作饭，为什么就认为是“丢人”、“没出息”呢？
    不少青年读书读到初中毕业或高中毕业，就看不起工人和农民，看不起理发工人、缝衣工人、厨师，就认为自己比工人、学徒和农民“高一等”，比理发工人、缝衣工人、厨师“高一等”。他们读了几句书，不是更谦虚，而是更骄傲；不是更尊重体力劳动者，而是更看不起体力劳动者。有个女同学来信说：“要年轻白嫩的姑娘去种地，去担土、挑大粪，太不像话。”劳动人民用他们的劳动把自己的子女养大起来，送到学校去读书，而子女读了书，就说种地、担土、挑大粪“不像话”。这样去培养青年，对劳动人民有什么用处呢？少教出一些抱这种错误态度的人，对劳动人民的事业不是更有好处吗？这些现象充分说明，由于中国文化落后，知识分子少，特别是由于学校里的政治教育薄弱，脱离实际，现在的青年学生还远没有摆脱中国知识分子历来就有的那种骄傲自大的劣根性的影响，以至他们在新中国的学校里受了多年教育，还不懂得尊重劳动和劳动人民，甚至还在劳动人民面前摆架子。正如毛泽东同志所说的：
    “有许多知识分子，他们自以为很有知识，大摆其知识架子，而不知道这种架子是不好的，是有害的，是阻碍他们前进的。他们应该知道一个真理，就是许多所谓知识分子，其实是比较地最无知识的，工农分子的知识有时倒比他们多一点。”
    因此，毛泽东同志“劝那些只有书本知识但还没有接触实际的人，或者实际经验尚少的人，应该明白自己的缺点，将自己的态度放谦虚一些。”
    因此，现在已经得到了一定书本知识的中小学毕业生，应该毅然决然地、愉快积极地投入到生产劳动中去，特别是投入到农业生产中去，获得生产斗争的实际知识，使书本知识和实际知识结合起来，促进自己的提高和发展。
    为此目的，就必须首先去掉上述各种错误的观点和想法，改变上述错误的态度和作风。自己有这样的观点，自己首先改正，别人有这样的观点，帮助别人改正，这才是进步青年追求进步的应有态度。自己有这样的观点去向别人宣传，或者听到别人宣传这样的观点而不坚决反驳，这就是思想落后、政治落后的一种表现。学校中的党政领导人员、教师职员和青年工作者，学生的家长，特别是身为国家工作人员的学生家长，如果听到这样的观点在青年学生中到处传播，到处泛滥，而不组织辩论，不进行教育和批评，那就表明自己的思想工作薄弱和政治认识不高。最近各地都已经重视劳动教育，当然，这是好的。但是，如果不结合马克思主义的劳动观点，着重地解决“种地丢人不丢人，有出息没出息”这个根本性质的问题，如果还是像过去那样抽象地背诵原理原则，而不联系实际，那是肯定不能解决什么问题的。我们的同志常说要加强青年的思想教育工作，常说要使思想教育联系实际，但是，如果不把学生中普遍存在的“种地丢人不丢人，有出息没出息”这样大的实际问题和政治问题，好好地联系起来向学生进行教育，那不是“南其辕，而北其辙”吗？
    其次，有人说，下乡种地，“没有前途”。这种说法一方面是轻视劳动、轻视农民的另一种表现；另一方面，在很大程度上，又同他们对农业在国民经济中占着什么地位、对农民在社会主义建设中起着什么作用这些问题缺少了解，有很大的关系。
    工业是国民经济各部门的领导力量，而农业发展则是工业发展的基础。中共第八次全国代表大会关于政治报告的决议指出：“农业对于工业化事业有多方面的极其重大的影响，农业的发展不仅直接地影响着人民生活的水平和轻工业发展的速度，而且也影响着重工业发展的速度。”因此，我们必须努力地大大地发展农业生产。而要发展农业生产，就必须对农业进行社会改革和技术改革。在全国农业合作化基本完成以后，社会改革方面还有一些工作要作，但是，这些工作不久就可以作完。今后的主要任务，就是要把农业合作社经营管理好，逐步地而又适当地进行技术改革，大大地发展农业生产。必须懂得，管理一个几百户的农业生产合作社，比管理一个几百人的工厂是不会更容易些的，要把全国几十万个农业合作社管理好，要实现我国农业伟大的技术改革，我们还必须进行很多的艰苦工作。
    农业发展纲要草案，是我国进行农业技术改革和农村建设的长期规划，它在全国人民面前展示了我国农业发展的第一个伟大的远景，它已经成为全国农民极大的鼓舞力量。这个纲要实现以后，我们将继续实行第二个、第三个类似的纲要，实现我国农业的机械化、电气化、科学化。现在二十岁的青年，是完全有可能看到我国的农村变成真正富裕、真正幸福的农村的。
    土地改革和农业合作化，是我国农村两个历史性的根本改革。合作化以后的农村是新的农村，农民是新的农民，但是，现在的农村和农民都还缺少文化。为着搞好农业合作社的经营管理工作，为着逐步地进行农业的技术改革，农村迫切需要文化，农民自己需要提高文化，同时也需要有文化的人去当农民。除开大批小学毕业生参加农业生产以外，如果从今年开始，每年有近百万以至一百多万的中学毕业生下乡，五年以内有四百万至五百万中学毕业生去参加农业生产，并且以后一年比一年有更多的中学毕业生下乡，同农民群众在生产劳动中亲密地结合起来，那么，可以肯定，农业合作社的经营管理工作和农业的技术改革就将得到一个极大的推动力量，就将促进我国农村实现另一个根本改革——技术改革，促进我国农业生产空前地向前大发展。
    有些同学愿意下乡工作，但是要当干部，不愿种地。现在的农村和农业合作社需要一些干部，例如会计、文书等等，这是事实。但是，我们劝告下乡的学生，最好在开始的一个时期不要去作会计、当干部，也不一定去学那些特种农业技术，而要先去种地，老老实实、勤勤恳恳地去种地，向有经验的老农学习，经过三年到五年的时间，学会全国最普遍、最大量的一种农业生产知识——种地知识，真正成为一个光荣的劳动农民，把现在一般农民能做和会做的事情，全部都学会。要知道，刚下去的学生虽然是有文化的，可是他们还不是真正的农民，还没有农民的本领，还没有取得农民的资格。他们真正学会了最大多数农民所知道的农业生产知识，再去学农业特种技术知识，或者去当干部，就要比较好些。否则，他们将缺少一种最基本、最大多数农民都知道的知识，而不利于他们以后的发展。
    同时，我们劝告一切下乡的青年学生，要用心地搞好自己同农民群众的关系。为此，就不要采取对乡村“一切都看不惯”、对一切都乱加指责的傲慢态度。下乡以后，应当处处想到帮助别人，在同别人相处的时候，不要占别人的便宜，不要怕自己吃了一点亏，使自己真正成为农民的朋友。要采取学习和帮助的态度，去对待乡村干部；对他们的缺点和优点要多看看，要看全面；对那些已经看准了的缺点，要善意地帮助他们克服，使自己成为干部的朋友。
    这样，下乡的学生和原来的农民才会结成一体，打成一片；他们的书本知识和实际知识才能互相结合，相互为用。到那个时候，讲种地，他们和原来的农民一样；讲文化，他们比原来的农民更高；讲政治，他们和其他农民群众的关系很好。这样，他们自己就会真正成为中国第一代有文化的新式农民，农民群众就会信任他们。大家知道，国家机关和合作社的管理机关都是民主选举的。那个时候，只要真正是为人民群众所信任和拥护的并且是有能力的人，他就有可能由人民群众选出来当人民代表，当合作社的干部，当国家机关的干部。而这样的干部才真正是群众中涌现出来的，而不是从上面硬安下去的。当然，我们的劳动是为了整个社会的进步，而不是为了替个人挣得某种地位，例如作干部等等。作干部也同作农民一样，是为人民服务，不过这究竟只是很少数人的工作，而且不是一种可以终身不变的职业。但是无论如何，各级国家机关和事业机关的老一代的人总是要被年轻人代替的。那些真正从工人、农民出身，能吃苦，有文化，有工作能力，又取得人民群众信任和拥护的年轻人，就是说，那些德才兼备的年轻人，当然最有可能来接替老一代的人。
    据说在一部分学生中，因为想到不能升学，要下乡种地，已经发生了学习上的消极情绪。他们说：“下乡打土块，学文化有什么用？学几何三角有什么用？”这种情绪是不好的，这种说法是不对的。前面说过，农村迫切需要有文化的人，文化知识愈多，对农村的用处就愈大。中学教育是普通教育，它使人得到一种普通的知识，谁掌握了这些知识，谁就打下了进一步学习的基础，他以后就可以经过自己的努力，一步一步地提高自己的文化技术水平。几何三角，物理化学，这些方面的知识虽然对种地不见得马上就都直接用得上，但是学了这些科学，就比较容易接受新的农业技术，而且这些科学常识在以后的学习和实际工作、实际生活中，还经常要使用。一般地说，掌握初步的科学常识，不但使人的知识广博，使人的头脑得到锻炼，使人的思维和语言更加准确，更加有条理，而且可以使人养成科学的唯物主义的自然观，脱离对自然现象的迷信状态。因此，一切在校学生，不论毕业的或不毕业的，不论能升学的或不能升学的，都应当继续努力学习，认真学习，学好一切功课，一直学到毕业，拿到文凭，或者升学，或者进工厂，或者加入某种行业学手艺，或者高高兴兴地下乡去。而在参加生产以后，也要利用业余时间和农闲时间，继续进行学习，按照各人的不同兴趣和国家的不同需要，学习不同的科目。可以学马克思列宁主义，可以学科学技术，也可以学文学艺术。学习的组织形式，可以多种多样。有的个人自学，有的成立互助小组，有的组织业余学校，有的进夜大学或函授学校，将来有的还可以进训练班，入了党的还可以进党校，生产好、学习好的还可能进大学。因此，青年人在参加工农业生产以后，决不要停止自己的学习。
    有人说，不进大学，下乡种地，再不能当专家了。这也不一定对。问题主要不是在大学或在农村，而是自己的态度是否正确，自己的努力是否顽强。大学毕业生并不每个人都是科学家，科学家也并不每个人都是大学毕业生。米丘林是个大农业科学家，但他并没有进过大学；高尔基是个大文豪，他连小学都没有进过。著名的科学家、文学家和政治家佛兰克林，著名的物理学家法拉第，都是学徒出身。著名的发明家爱迪生和诺贝尔，都只进过很短时间的小学。这样的例子，还可以举出很多。因此，我们的中学毕业生下乡种地，只要他顽强努力，坚持自学，他还是有可能成为专家或科学家。至于说到政治家或政治工作人员，那么可以说，下乡种地，或者进工厂作工，或者加入不同行业作手艺，只会更有可能锻炼成为优秀的政治家或政治工作人员。例如，中国共产党的中央委员和各级领导人员，只有少数人是大学生，绝大多数人都只进过中学或小学，有些人连小学也没进过。因此，能不能说，中学毕业生进大学的前途一定比下农村的好呢？不能这样说。能不能说，下农村去所能学到的东西一定比进大学少呢？也不能这样说。
    人们知道，我党中央和各级地方党委，除开城市党委和个别省委以外，是把主要力量放在农村的。现在全国各地各级正在精简机构，抽调干部，层层下放，深入农村。成千成万的干部与农民同吃、同住、同劳动，有的县长背粪筐，有的县委书记挑大粪。人们也知道，全国五亿多农民正在党和政府的领导下，辛勤劳动，积极生产，为争取今年的大丰收，为建设社会主义的新农村而努力奋斗。难道全国从上到下，从领袖到群众，这样重视农村工作和农业经济，都是在做着没有前途的事业么？不，他们都是在做着具有伟大前途的事业。农村既然有伟大的前途，为什么说下乡学生没有前途呢？在新社会里面，每件有益于人民的事业都有前途，每个忠于人民利益的人也都有前途。中国第一代有文化的新式农民，这就是下乡种地的学生的前途，这个前途是光明的、伟大的，然而必须经过艰苦的努力和锻炼，才可能达到。种地是要流汗的，是要吃苦的，它比口头讲劳动光荣困难得多，它给人民带来的好处，却比任何好话大得无法比拟。
    其次，有人说，他们愿意去种地，但必须去外县外乡，不愿回本县本乡。他们说，社会上有一种压力，使他们难于在本乡本地生活下去。他们的父母兄弟，他们的亲戚朋友，他们的老师同学，现在都还在不同程度上带着轻视农业、轻视农民的观点，不愿意要自己的子弟回家种地。他们也认为读了十几年书，还背个锄头，跟在牛屁股后面，是“没出息”。他们的冷言冷语使下乡种地的学生不能忍受。农民自己看不起自己，这是几千年来封建统治阶级压在他们身上的一个包袱，我们有责任帮助他们解除这个包袱。只要解除了这个包袱，也就解除了学生回乡种地的社会压力。因此，我们在向广大青年学生进行思想教育的同时，在城市、在农村，必须着重向学生的家长和师友，向广大的农民和干部，进行广泛的深入的宣传教育工作，使他们对农业生产、对农民群众、对学生回乡有正确的认识，使他们采取热情关怀的态度，鼓励学生回乡，欢迎学生回乡，使下乡学生能够安于农村，安于种地。
    这里必须指出：人们的思想可以改变，但不是一朝一夕能够改变得好的。下乡的青年应当在精神上有所准备，要站稳脚跟，坚定认识。不怕讽刺讥笑，不怕冷言冷语。别人说种地“丢人”，自己就应当理直气壮地说种地不丢人；别人说种地“没出息”，自己就应当说这对国家对人民大有出息，要耐心地向人作解释，讲道理，既不动摇，也不傲慢。用自己的行动来说服人，影响人，长年累月，始终不懈，人们就会信服他们，尊重他们。
    最后，有人说，不能升学，要去种地，这是“吃了亏”。近来确实有一些人过分地热衷于个人名利，追逐着钱多、待遇好和较为轻松的事情干，而不愿干工资较少、待遇较薄或者较为困难的事情，即使这些事情对国家和人民都是十分需要的。这是一股歪风。它确实吹倒了一些人，也还正在吸引着一部分人。国家为了调节社会各部分人民的生活，对某些人的待遇不够合理的地方，应当加以调整。但是，我们希望青年在这股歪风前面，能够站得稳，不要跟着这股歪风跑。
    中国革命胜利以前，中国共产党员和许多革命者，不怕杀头，不怕坐牢，他们离乡别井，东奔西走，不计名利，不图享受，唯一想到的是国家的存亡和人民的祸福。他们为了革命事业的胜利，英勇牺牲，艰苦奋斗，前面的人倒下去，后面的人立即跟上来；革命失败了，马上重振旗鼓，继续战斗。这些具有伟大的革命气魄和自我牺牲精神的人，在过去，曾经被反动统治者看作“大逆不道”的“叛逆”，也曾经被一些只顾个人利益、不顾人民利益和只问个人前途、不问国家前途的所谓“聪明人”看作“傻子”。但是，历史的结论是公正的。革命依靠这些“傻子”和广大人民的努力在全国胜利了，反革命被推翻了，那时的“聪明人”有的由于事实的教训后来站到人民方面来了，有的被人民抛弃了。而一切在革命中牺牲了的先烈，现在得到了全国人民的尊敬，并将千秋万代地受到人民的景仰。
    那末，在社会主义建设时期，还需要不需要这样的“傻子”呢？我们的理想是美丽的，我们的途程又是艰难的。祖国建设的各方面需要更多的这类“傻子”，需要更加发挥这样的“傻劲”。值得注意的是在我们一部分干部和一部分青年中，近来渐渐地遗忘了这种优良的传统，在他们中间出现了一些所谓新时代的“聪明人”。这些人在分配工作的时候，首先想到的不是祖国的需要，而是个人的前途；他们遇到困难的时候，不是首先自己想办法克服，而是向国家伸手提要求。他们对工作不负责任，拣轻怕重，把重担子推给别人，自己挑轻的。一事当前，先替自己打算。他们斤斤计较个人地位和个人待遇，不是同别人比艰苦、比工作，而是比高低、比阔气，有的甚至发展到了争名夺利、唯利是图的地步。这些人灵魂深处的六个大字是：贪便宜，怕吃亏。
    我们要劝告一切干部和一切青年，不要向这些“聪明人”学，而要向那些“傻子”学，不要怕吃苦，不要怕自己吃了一点亏。必须懂得，光想占便宜，生怕吃亏的人，是思想上、政治上不健康的人，是不值得信任的人。而为了国家和人民的利益不怕自己吃亏的人，才是高尚的、有道德的、脱离了低级趣味的人，才是真有理想，能够站得住脚、能够得到人民信任的人。从长远说来，前一种人在最后是要吃大亏的，而后一种人则最后将得到他所应得的待遇。必须懂得：要和群众的关系搞好，就不能占便宜，就不要怕自己吃亏。要完成任何伟大的事业，都必须有吃苦耐劳的精神，都必须有意识地把较为艰苦和困难的工作担当起来。这样作一次二次，人家也许还不注意，作十次八次，人家还可能把他看作“傻子”，十年，二十年，长期地这样做下去，人家就会说他是好人，就会信任他，拥护他。吃苦在前，享福在后，这是取得党和人民群众信任的基本条件。我们希望青年都能够向着这个方向锻炼自己，把自己锻炼成为具有“先天下之忧而忧，后天下之乐而乐”这种美德的人。青年人要有理想，我们希望一切青年人都有这样高尚的理想。（附图片）
