Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 10th. An open-pit iron mine that can produce large quantities of ore in the same year it is built has begun construction in southern Hebei Province. This open-pit mine will be able to produce some ore in mid-April this year while preparing for production, and will be able to produce in large quantities in September. It is expected to produce 120,000 tons of ore for the country this year. The iron content of the ore is around 65%.

This state-owned local iron mine is built in Kuangshan Village, Wu'an County, Hebei Province. The open-pit mine includes several iron hills, mainly Kuangshan (formerly known as Hongshan). According to local ancient inscriptions, this place was a large-scale iron-smelting base in the second year of Dade in the Yuan Dynasty (1298 AD). According to the situation of one mine that has now been clearly explored, it is expected that the reserves here are larger than those of the current state-owned Cishan Iron Mine in Hebei, and most of them are high-quality ore. The geological department is continuing to survey this area. (Attached picture)

    河北兴建一座露天铁矿
    当年建矿当年就可大量采矿
    新华社保定10日电　一座当年建矿当年就可以生产大量矿石的露天铁矿，在河北省南部开始兴建。这个露天开采的铁矿，在今年4月中旬开始组织生产准备的同时就可以出一部分矿石，9月就可以大量生产，预计今年将给国家生产矿石十二万吨。矿石的含铁量都在65％左右。
    这个地方国营的铁矿，建在河北省武安县矿山村。露天铁矿包括以矿山（原名硔山）为主的几个铁山头。据当地古碑铭记，这里在元朝大德二年（公元一二九八年）就是一个颇具规模的冶铁基地。据现在已经勘探清楚的一个矿山情况预计，这里比现在河北地方国营磁山铁矿的埋藏量大，而且绝大部分是质量很高的矿石。地质部门正在对这个地区继续进行勘察。（附图片）
