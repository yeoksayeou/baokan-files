Brothers Party's Life

    For the Romanian and French Working People and the Friendship Between the Two Countries
    The Romanian Workers' Party and the French Communist Party Decide to Strengthen Cooperation
    The Romanian newspaper published on April 23rd a declaration of the talks between the delegation of the Romanian Workers' Party and the delegation of the French Communist Party.

    The declaration said that the delegations of the two parties studied the development of the fraternal relations between the Romanian Workers' Party and the French Communist Party, and the prospects for strengthening friendly cooperation between the peoples of the two countries, and exchanged views on the current international situation and the development of the international workers' movement. The two parties have completely identical views.

    Speaking of the situation in Europe, the declaration said that the two parties believe that the patriotic duty of the French and Romanian people is to oppose the remilitarization of West Germany, and to unite all forces against the recurrence of new war disasters.

    The two parties' representatives condemned the imperialist counter-revolutionary conspiracy in the Hungarian incident. The two parties' delegations agreed with the Soviet Union's military assistance to the Hungarian working people, believing that the Soviet Union's actions were in line with the principles of proletarian internationalism, and that it made new and significant contributions in safeguarding peace and the security of all countries.

    Speaking of the lessons of the Hungarian incident, the declaration said that it is necessary to strengthen party discipline, safeguard party unity, and strengthen the party's ties with the working class and other working masses.

    The declaration said that the Soviet Union is the first country to build socialism, and it has the richest experience. The parties of Romania and France will continue to learn from the Soviet Union. The two parties will continue to resolutely struggle for the purity of Marxism-Leninism and against any attempts at revisionism.

    The declaration finally said that, based on the principles of proletarian internationalism, the two parties will strengthen cooperation in a way that benefits the working people of the two countries, consolidates Romanian-French friendship, and benefits socialist peace.
