    After We Participated in Production
    Li Youwen, Deputy County Chief of Nanzheng County, Shaanxi Province
    Participating in production to lead production is an effective way to improve leadership style and strengthen the relationship between cadres and the masses. I used to say this often, but I rarely did it in practice, and even when I did, it was only "once in a while." The fact that many full-time cadres in agricultural cooperatives do not participate in agricultural production is, to some extent, influenced by the cadres stationed in the cooperatives. As a result, the relationship between cadres and the masses has become estranged, and subjectivism and bureaucracy have grown. This time, when we went to the countryside, we ate, lived, and labored with the masses, and we achieved very good results.
    On the evening of March 3rd, I arrived at the Qunying Agricultural Cooperative and stayed at a member's home. From the 4th to the 10th, I spent one day inspecting the production of the entire cooperative; another day convening a meeting of cadres from three townships to disseminate the methods we adopted in the Qunying Cooperative and guide key work; and half a day surveying a river embankment for the Qunlian Cooperative. The remaining four and a half days were spent with the cooperative members, participating in labor such as carrying sand, carrying soil, and digging ponds. The four comrades from the county party committee's investigation and research group, who arrived two days before me, also participated in productive labor during the same period. The cooperative members generally reflected, "The cadres who came this time are very different from the past!" In the past, some masses thought that our cadres "can't carry on their shoulders, can't lift with their hands, and earn tens of yuan a month, very comfortably"; now they say "the working comrades are also very hard, they have to do official business and also participate in labor." In the past, some farmers, in order to explain that the 460 jin of food grain allocated to each person was not enough, would either complain or serve poor food when cadres came to their homes for meals; now they serve two meals of dry rice every day, spinach fried with radish in the morning, and fermented soybeans with preserved meat in the afternoon. They said, "After working all day and still doing official business, it is right to eat better." More importantly, the majority of the masses and cooperative cadres can tell us their innermost thoughts without any reservations. For example, when I was eating at Yang Xingfu's home, his mother said to me, "Some people say that it is too tiring after joining the cooperative, but that's only what those who weren't strong laborers in the past say. Before liberation, we went to the fields before dawn and didn't finish work until the moon came down. If we didn't do a good job of farming, we would have nothing to eat after paying the rent. Now we go to the fields after the sun comes out and finish work when it gets dark, so what's so tiring!" Cooperative member Li Mingsheng, while eating, told me about some shortcomings in production in Xiaoya Cooperative, a neighboring village. Another cooperative member, during a casual conversation, asked me to introduce a cadre to his eldest daughter as a son-in-law, and finally he added, "It's really hard to say these things, and you shouldn't tell outsiders." In short, every day during meals and labor, I could hear a lot of "news" and their true thoughts from the masses. Because of this, the several propaganda sessions we conducted at the water conservancy site were very popular among the masses. They said, "The cadres can predict the future!" meaning that our words struck a chord in their hearts.
    When we first arrived in this township, the work start time was 9:30 AM, and some people were late until after 10:00 AM. The number of people working was only 116. Later, due to our participation in labor and the strengthening of political and ideological work, the number of people working increased to 203, basically reaching full attendance, and the work start time was advanced to 8:00 AM. Several old women heard that we were participating in labor and they also came to participate. Huang Deming, the most reluctant laborer in the entire cooperative, was a 22-year-old youth who used to avoid cadres whenever he saw them. From last autumn to now, he had only worked less than ten workdays in more than 150 days. This time, after education, he also actively went to work. Cooperative member Jia Mingfu said, "As long as there are cadres like this to lead us, the cooperative will definitely be well-run." Some said, "Last year, Comrade Zi came to our cooperative. He sat by the field while we worked, and he even wore a mask when he spoke. How could such a cadre do a good job!"
    Due to specific guidance at the construction site, it also played a significant role in ensuring the quality of the project. Last year, this cooperative spent more than 500 workdays carrying sand from the 18 mu of fields that were buried by sand before liberation. Because the embankment was built entirely of sand, the embankment was washed away when the rice was about to ripen, and the fields were buried by sand again. Not only was the previous effort wasted, but also more than 10,000 jin of rice were lost. This time, lessons were learned from last year, and yellow mud was used to build the embankment. The cooperative members said, "If we had done this last year, how could it have been washed away by the water!" Some people joked, "The county chief and the working comrades are all carrying sand and soil, it would be embarrassing if it were washed away again." Others said, "This year's rice is as good as being stored in the granary."
    Our participation in production has reduced many unnecessary meetings and increased the amount of time spent doing practical work. In the seven days in the cooperative, we did not hold a single meeting of cooperative members, nor even a single meeting of the entire team, but we had contact with a considerable number of cooperative members. Each time, 150 to 200 people were educated at the construction site. There were two breaks every day at the construction site, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, each lasting half an hour. After work was completed and scores were assigned, there was still some time to spare. In this way, without affecting production, there was still one and a half to two hours each day to do work. In the past few days, we discussed the "three guarantees" plan and the production plan, studied the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on vigorously leading farmers to raise pigs, and imparted the techniques for cultivating strong seedlings, etc. In the evening, cadres can study on their own or write materials, and farmers can rest early. As a result, the masses are very satisfied and demand that it be continued to the end.

    我们参加了生产以后
    陕西省南郑县副县长　李有温
    参加生产领导生产，是改进领导作风、密切干群关系的有效方法。过去我也常这样说，但真正做的很少，即使做也是“一时半下”。许多农业社的脱产干部不参加农业生产，在一定程度上是受了驻社干部的影响。这样，干群关系疏远了，主观主义和官僚主义滋长了。这次下乡，我们和群众同吃、同住、同劳动，收到了很好的效果。
    3月3日晚上，我到了群英农业社，住在社员家里。从4日到10日的七天中，用一天时间检查了全社的生产；另一天召开了三个乡的干部接头会，传播了我们在群英社采取的一些办法，指导了重点的工作；还有半天给群联社勘查了一条河堤。其余整整四天半的时间，都和社员同来同去，参加了担沙、担土、挖塘等劳动。比我先来两天的县委调查研究组的四个同志，在同时期内都参加了生产劳动。社员普遍反映：“这回来的干部和以往大不同了！”过去有些群众认为我们的干部“肩不能挑，手不能拿，一月嫌上几十元，很舒服”；现在却说“工作同志也很辛苦，要办公事还要参加劳动”。过去有些农民为了说明每人留的四百六十斤口粮不够吃，遇到干部到他家吃饭不是诉苦就是给吃不好的；现在是每天两顿大米干饭，早上菠菜炒萝卜，下午豆豉腊肉。他们说：“劳动一天还要办公，吃的好些是应该的。”更主要的是多数群众和社干部能毫无顾虑地给我们说他们的心里话。例如我在杨兴富家里吃饭的时候，他的母亲对我说：“有人说入社后太累，那只是些过去劳动不强的人说的。我们解放前天不明就上地，月亮下来才收工，做不好庄稼交了租就没啥吃。现在是太阳出来上地，天擦黑就收工，还累什么呀！”社员李明升在吃饭的时候，向我反映了邻村小崖社在生产中的一些缺点。还有一个社员在闲谈中要我给他的大女儿介绍个干部做女婿，最后他还嘱咐说：“这话实在不好说，你也不要对外人讲。”总之，每天在吃饭和劳动中，都能听到不少来自群众中的“新闻”和他们的真实思想。正因为这样，我们在水利工地上进行的几次宣传很受群众欢迎。他们说：“干部会算卦！”意思是指我们的话说到他们心上了。
    我们刚到这个乡的时候，上工时间是上午九点半，有的迟到十点多，上工人数只有一百一十六人。以后，由于我们参加劳动和加强了政治思想工作，上工人数增加到二百零三人，基本上达到全部出勤，上工时间提前到八点钟。有几个老太婆听说我们参加了劳动，她们也跑来参加了。全社最不爱劳动的黄德明，是个二十二岁的青年，过去见了干部就绕开走，去年秋后到现在一百五十多天中只做了不上十个工。这次经过教育，他也积极出工了。社员贾明福说：“只要有这样的干部来领导，合作社保险能办好。”有的说：“去年我们社里来了个訾同志，我们劳动他坐在田边上，说话还要带口罩，那样的干部哪能把工作做好！”
    由于在工地上具体指导，对保证工程质量也起了很大作用。这个社去年花了五百多个工，担出解放前被沙压的十八亩田里的沙；由于堤坎是光用沙子筑起的，谷子快要成熟的时候堤被冲垮了，田又被沙压住了，不但前功尽弃，而且损失谷子一万多斤。这次接受了上年的教训，用黄泥筑坎。社员们说：“如果去年就这样做，怎能叫水冲了！”有的人开玩笑地说：“县长和工作同志都担沙担土，再冲了简直不看面子。”还有的说：“今年的谷子等于装在仓里了。”
    我们参加了生产，减少了许多不必要的会议，增加了不少做实际工作的时间。到社七天，不仅没有开社员大会，连全队的会议也没有召开一次，可是接触的社员相当多。在工地受到教育的，每次都有一百五十到二百多人。工地上每天上午下午各有一次休息，每次半点钟，收工评分后还能抽一点时间。这样，每天在不影响生产的情况下，还有一个半到两个钟头的时间可以做工作。几天来，我们讨论了“三包”方案和生产计划，学习了中共中央和国务院关于大力领导农民养猪的决议，传授了培养壮秧的技术等。晚上，干部可以自习或者写材料，农民可以早休息。这样做的结果，群众很满意，要求坚持到底。
