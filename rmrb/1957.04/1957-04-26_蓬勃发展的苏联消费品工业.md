The Flourishing Soviet Consumer Goods Industry

Starting from April 25th, the Soviet Union has once again reduced the prices of many consumer goods, marking the second price reduction this year. Higher-end consumer goods, such as watches, vacuum cleaners, and radios, have seen more significant price cuts. This demonstrates the vigorous development of the Soviet consumer goods industry and signifies a further increase in the people's living standards and welfare.

The consumer goods available to the Soviet working people have greatly increased in the past two years, and this year will see even more than any previous year. Take textiles as an example: the Soviet people will receive 35 million meters more silk fabrics, 9 million meters more woolen fabrics, 38.5 million meters more linen fabrics, and a large quantity of cotton clothing this year compared to last year. In addition, food, meat, and dairy products are also more abundant than before. City residents can now get enough fresh milk regardless of the season. This is a sign of the growing prosperity of the Soviet national economy and the further enrichment of the people's lives.

Since the October Revolution, when the working people seized power, the production of consumer goods has increased rapidly in the Soviet Union. By the end of the Soviet Union's second five-year plan, the production of consumer goods had increased by five and a half times compared to 1913. After the Second World War, the achievements made by the Soviet Union in developing heavy industry laid a solid foundation for the further development of consumer goods production. As a result, the production of consumer goods has developed even more rapidly. If we take the output of consumer goods in 1940 as 100, then it was 123 in 1950, 216 in 1955, and is projected to be 350 by 1960 (see table above).

According to the directives of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union regarding the Sixth Five-Year Plan, the production of the Soviet consumer goods industry will increase by 60% by 1960 compared to 1955, while the production of the means of production will increase by 70%. The increase in the production of the means of production is only 10% more than the increase in consumer goods production, a figure smaller than in the past several five-year plans. This shows that the proportion of Soviet consumer goods production in industrial production is growing larger and larger. It indicates that on the basis of a greatly developed heavy industry, the Soviet Union has gradually been able to allocate more funds to the production of consumer goods and pay more attention to the production of consumer goods.

The development of socialist agriculture has also created conditions for the development of consumer goods production. Especially after the Soviet Union vigorously reclaimed wasteland, the harvest of agricultural products has surged, providing the consumer goods industry with sufficient raw materials and enabling it to develop rapidly.

The production of Soviet consumer goods is to increase by 60% in the Sixth Five-Year Plan. To accomplish this task, it is stipulated that 59 billion rubles should be invested, more than 1,600 new factories should be built, many existing enterprises should be renovated, and special attention should be paid to the adoption of new technologies and equipment. At the same time, many new enterprises are to be built in the Ural, Siberia, and Far East regions, which can improve the geographical distribution of light industry and reduce the long-distance transportation of raw materials and finished products.

Take the textile industry as an example. During the five-year plan period, many new textile mills will be built, with more than 3 million spindles and 95,000 looms put into production. By 1960, cotton fabrics will increase by 23% compared to 1955, woolen fabrics will increase by 45%, and silk fabrics will increase the most, by more than double. Currently, the Soviet Union produces as much silk fabric in two weeks as the total annual output during the Tsarist era.

The production of man-made fibers has achieved tremendous development in recent years. In 1940, the Soviet Union had only two factories producing man-made fibers, with an annual output of only 10,000 tons. But now there are more than a dozen factories, with an annual output of over 100,000 tons. By 1960, its output will increase by another two times, reaching 330,000 tons.

The production of valuable consumer goods will increase the most during the Sixth Five-Year Plan. For example, radios and televisions will increase by more than one and a half times, household refrigerators will increase by 3.2 times, furniture will increase by more than double, and household washing machines will increase by more than five times, etc.

In this five-year plan, the major food industry products in the Soviet Union are to increase by 65% to 200%. More than 680 new food factories will be built. This means that on average, two food factories will start operation every less than five days. Among food products, sugar, meat, and dairy products will all increase by about double.

The level of production development achieved by the Soviet Union has greatly increased the social wealth of the Soviet Union, thereby creating conditions for vigorously improving the people's living standards and welfare.

### 蓬勃发展的苏联消费品工业

    蓬勃发展的苏联消费品工业
    从4月25日起，苏联许多消费品又降低了价格，这是今年的第二次减价。其中高级消费品，如钟表、吸尘器、收音机等都减价较多。这说明苏联消费品工业的蓬勃发展，也表明人民生活福利的进一步增长。
    苏联劳动人民近两年来得到的消费品已大大增加了，今年又将比过去任何一年都多。就以纺织品为例吧，苏联人民今年将比去年多得到三千五百万公尺丝织品，九百万公尺毛织品，三千八百五十万公尺亚麻织品和大量棉布成衣等。此外，食品、肉乳制品也比从前丰盛多了。城市居民不分冬夏都可以得到足够的鲜牛奶了。这是苏联国民经济日益繁荣、人民生活更加富裕的标志。
    苏联自从十月革命劳动人民掌握了政权后，消费品的生产迅速增加着。到苏联第二个五年计划末期，消费品的生产就已比1913年增加了五倍半。在第二次世界大战后，苏联发展重工业所获得的成就，为进一步发展消费品的生产建立了巩固的基础。因而，消费品的生产也就更迅速地发展了起来。如果以1940年消费品的产量做为一百，则1950年为一百二十三，1955年为二百一十六，到1960年预计为三百五十（见上表）。
    根据苏联共产党第二十次代表大会关于第六个五年计划的指示来看，苏联消费品工业的生产到1960年将比1955年增加60％，而生产资料的生产将增加70％。生产资料的生产同消费品生产增加数相比仅多10％，这个数字比过去几个五年计划都小。这说明苏联消费品生产在工业生产中占的比重越来越大了。说明苏联在大大发展了的重工业的基础上，已逐渐有可能为消费品的生产拨出更多的资金，更多地注意消费品的生产了。
    社会主义农业的发展，也为消费品生产的发展创造了条件，尤其是苏联大力开垦荒地以后，农产品的收获量激增，消费品工业得到充足的原料，更获得迅速发展的可能。
    苏联消费品的生产在第六个五年计划中要增加60％。为了完成这项任务，规定要投资五百九十亿卢布，要新建一千六百多个工厂，改建许多现有企业，并特别注意采用新的技术和设备。同时，许多新企业要建在乌拉尔、西伯利亚和远东一带，这可以改善轻工业的地理配置，减少原料和成品的远程运输。
    就拿纺织工业来说吧，五年计划期间将要建筑许多新的纺织厂，要有三百多万纺锭和九万五千部织机投入生产。到1960年，棉织品要比1955年增加23％，毛织品增加45％，丝织品增加最多，为一倍以上。目前苏联每两星期生产的丝织品就等于沙俄时代的全年产量。
    人造纤维近年来获得了巨大的发展。1940年苏联只有两个工厂生产人造纤维，年产量只有一万吨。但现在已有十几个工厂，年产量在十万吨以上了。到1960年，它的产量将再增加两倍，达三十三万吨。
    贵重的消费品在第六个五年计划期间增加得最多。例如，收音机和电视机将增加一倍半以上，家用冰箱增加三点二倍，家具增加一倍多，家用洗衣机增加五倍以上等。
    在这个五年计划中，苏联主要的食品工业产品要增加65％到200％。新建的食品工厂将有六百八十多个。这就是说，平均不到五天就有两个食品工厂开工。食品中砂糖和肉类乳类都要增加一倍左右。
    由于苏联生产发展所达到的水平，已使苏联社会财富大大增加，从而有条件来大力提高人民的生活福利。
