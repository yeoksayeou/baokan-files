Xinhua News Agency, London, April 12th: Singapore delegation leader Lim Yew Hock and British Colonial Secretary Lennox-Boyd signed the report on Singapore and Britain's negotiations on Singapore's internal self-government on April 11th.

According to this report, Singapore, which has been ruled by Britain for 137 years, will achieve internal self-government as a state within the Commonwealth. After the establishment of the new state, all members of the Singapore Legislative Assembly will be elected. The Cabinet, presided over by the Prime Minister, is responsible to this fully elected Legislative Assembly. The current Governor's Office of Singapore will be abolished after the realization of autonomy, and a person born in Malaya will be appointed by the British government to serve as the representative of the British Queen. The Queen's representative has the right to approve laws and make other decisions according to the instructions of the British government.

After Singapore achieves internal self-government, the British government will transfer the power to handle trade and cultural relations to the Singapore government, ending the power to enact laws in Singapore under the British Queen's decree. However, the British government will retain the right to suspend the constitution and make new arrangements for the Singapore government. The Commissioner of the United Kingdom also has the right to declare a state of emergency. At the same time, the British government will continue to be responsible for Singapore's foreign affairs and defense, and has full rights to occupy, control, and use Singapore's military bases and facilities.

According to the agreement reached by both parties, the British government agreed in principle that the Singapore government should bear the responsibility for maintaining domestic security. However, the British government believes that it should maintain great "concern" about this issue. Both parties agreed to establish a domestic security committee to prepare for the exchange of information and discuss issues related to maintaining law and order. This seven-member committee will be chaired by the Commissioner of the United Kingdom.

The Singapore delegation and the British side also reached an agreement in the negotiations on the drafting of Singapore's new constitution. At the final meeting held on April 11, the British government representatives indicated that they agreed to the conditions of the Singapore side's proposed domestic security arrangements and the new constitution on the condition that a provision be made to "ensure that those who are known to have engaged in subversive activities are not eligible to be elected to the first Legislative Assembly of the new Singapore state."

Singapore delegation leader Lim Yew Hock said that because Britain wanted to retain the right to speak on the candidates for the first parliament in Singapore, insisting that people who have "participated in subversive activities" should not be candidates for the Singapore national legislature goes against normal democratic practice, thus casting a shadow over the prospects for early self-government. Lim Yew Hock said that apart from this, the new constitution would be satisfactory.

    英国同意新加坡内部自治
    但仍保留外交和国防等权利
    据新华社伦敦12日电　新加坡代表团团长林有福和英国殖民地大臣伦诺克斯—波伊德4月11日在新加坡和英国关于新加坡实行内部自治谈判的报告上签了字。
    根据这项报告，由英国统治了一百三十七年的新加坡将作为一个国家在英联邦内实现内部自治。在新的国家成立以后，新加坡立法议会的议员将全部由选举产生。由总理主持的部长会议对这个完全由选举产生的立法议会负责，目前新加坡的总督府将在实现自治后取消，而由英国政府任命在马来亚出生的人员来担任英国女王代表。女王代表有权批准法律和根据英国政府的指示作出其他的决定。
    英国政府将在新加坡实现内部自治以后，把处理贸易和文化关系的权力交给新加坡政府。结束根据英国女王敕令在新加坡制定法律的权力。但是英国政府将保留停止宪法和为新加坡政府作新的安排的权利。联合王国的专员也有权宣布紧急状态。同时，英国政府将继续负责新加坡的外交和国防，并且有充分的权利来占有、控制和使用新加坡的军事基地和设施。
    根据双方达成的协议，英国政府在原则上同意新加坡政府担负维持国内安全的责任。但是英国政府认为，它要保持对这个问题的极大“关怀”。双方同意建立国内安全委员会，以便准备交换情报和讨论有关维持法律和秩序的问题。这个由七人组成的委员会将由联合王国专员担任主席。
    新加坡代表团和英国方面在谈判中就制定新加坡的新宪法草案也取得了协议。在4月11日举行的最后一次会议上，英国政府代表们表明，他们同意新加坡方面提出的关于国内安全的安排和新宪法的条件是作出一项规定，来“保证那些已经知道是曾经进行过颠复活动的人没有资格被选入新的新加坡国家第一届立法议会”。
    新加坡代表团团长林有福说，由于英国要在新加坡第一届议会的人选上保留发言权，坚持不让“参加过颠复活动”的人担任新加坡国家立法议会的候选人，是违背正常的民主惯例的，从而使得早期的自治政府的前景蒙上了阴云。林有福说，除掉这一点，新宪法将会是令人满意的。
