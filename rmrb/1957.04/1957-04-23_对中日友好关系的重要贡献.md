Editorial:

    The Sino-Japanese Friendship Mission of the Japanese Socialist Party and the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs issued a joint statement yesterday, announcing that both sides had reached a consensus on the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations and issues such as Asian and international peace. Judging from this joint statement, this visit to China by the Sino-Japanese Friendship Mission of the Japanese Socialist Party has made an important contribution to promoting friendship between China and Japan and striving for the early realization of the normalization of relations between the two countries.
    The Sino-Japanese Friendship Mission of the Japanese Socialist Party has had extensive and multiple contacts and talks with Chinese government leaders and people from all walks of life. These talks were conducted in a sincere, friendly, and frank atmosphere. This has enabled both sides to further enhance mutual understanding. Such mutual contact and understanding will obviously play an important role in enhancing the friendship between the people of China and Japan. The more these mutual visits and contacts between the people of China and Japan develop, the more the possibility of normalizing Sino-Japanese relations will increase.
    On the issue of normalizing Sino-Japanese relations, the Japanese Socialist Party has clearly stated its position, believing that the Taiwan issue is China's internal affair and not recognizing the existence of so-called "two Chinas." This position of the Japanese Socialist Party undoubtedly reflects the just demands of the broad masses of the Japanese people and is in line with the fundamental interests of the people of China and Japan. If this position can be accepted by the Japanese government, the issue of restoring Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations will be resolved sooner. Of course, to achieve this step, there are still many difficulties, and it still requires the efforts of the Japanese people and friends of the Japanese Socialist Party.
    From the Chinese side, our position on the issue of restoring Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations has always been very clear. We have always believed that for the benefit of the people of China and Japan, and for the benefit of peace in Asia and the world, relations between China and Japan should be normalized as soon as possible. But we will never allow anyone to use the issue of restoring Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations to peddle the conspiracy of "two Chinas." Under the current circumstances, we believe that developing exchanges and cooperation between China and Japan in the fields of economy, culture, and technology is beneficial to the people of both countries. If there have been obstacles and difficulties in this regard in the past, it was only external obstacles, or more precisely, obstruction from the United States. We are very pleased to see that the Japanese Socialist Party's attitude on this issue is becoming increasingly clear. We hope that with the promotion of the Japanese people and the Japanese Socialist Party, cultural and economic relations between China and Japan will become increasingly close, thereby paving the way for the normalization of relations between the two countries.
    China and Japan are two important countries in East Asia. Although our social systems are different and the positions we currently occupy are also different, peace is the most needed thing for the people of both countries. In order to maintain Asian peace, China and Japan must and can coexist peacefully. The problem now is that the imperialists do not want China and Japan to coexist peacefully. They fear that in this way, they will lose the opportunity to create tension in East Asia and obstruct the continued trend towards relaxation of the international situation. They can no longer control China now. Now, they are trying every means to control Japan, infringe upon Japan's sovereignty and independence, and provoke relations between China and Japan, attempting to turn Japan into their atomic bomb base, so that the Japanese people will once again suffer from serious war threats. The views of the Japanese Socialist Party on foreign policy and international issues show that a wide range of Japanese people are increasingly aware that Japan must play an independent and autonomous role in international affairs and make positive contributions to Asian and world peace. This is a gratifying thing.
    The visit of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Mission of the Japanese Socialist Party has enabled the Chinese people to have a deeper understanding of Japan and strengthened the friendship between the people of China and Japan. We believe that through more mutual visits between China and Japan, the friendly relations between the two countries will develop day by day.

### 对中日友好关系的重要贡献

    对中日友好关系的重要贡献
    日本社会党访华亲善使节团同中国人民外交学会在昨天发表了共同声明，宣布双方在有关中日邦交正常化以及亚洲和国际和平等问题上取得了一致的意见。从这个共同声明看来，日本社会党访华亲善使节团这次对中国的访问，已经对促进中日两国的友好和争取早日实现中日两国关系的正常化，作出了重要的贡献。
    日本社会党访华亲善使节团曾经同中国政府领导人和各方面人士进行了广泛的多次的接触和会谈。这些会谈都是在诚恳、友好、坦率的气氛中进行的。这就使得双方能更多地增进互相了解。这种相互接触和了解，对于增进中日两国人民之间的友谊，显然将起重要的作用。中日两国人民之间的这种相互访问和接触越发展，中日两国关系正常化的可能性也就会越增加。
    在中日两国关系正常化的问题上，日本社会党已经明确地阐明了自己的立场，认为台湾问题是中国的内政问题，不承认存在所谓“两个中国”。日本社会党的这个立场无疑地反映了广大日本人民的正义主张，是符合于中日两国人民的根本利益的。如果这种立场能为日本政府所接受，中日邦交恢复的问题，也就更能早日解决。当然，要达到这一步，困难还是很多，还有待于日本人民和日本社会党的诸位朋友们的努力。
    从中国方面来说，我们在恢复中日邦交问题上的立场一向是很明确的。我们一向认为，为了中日两国人民的利益，为了亚洲和世界和平的利益，中日两国的关系应该尽快地正常化。但是我们决不允许任何人利用中日恢复邦交问题来贩卖“两个中国”的阴谋。在目前的情况下，我们认为发展中日两国之间经济、文化、技术等方面的交流和合作，是对两国人民都有利的事情。如果说过去在这方面存在着障碍和困难的话，那仅仅是外来的障碍，更明确地说，是来自美国方面的阻挠。我们很高兴看到，日本社会党在这个问题上的态度是日趋明确的。我们希望在日本人民和日本社会党的推动之下，中日两国文化、经济方面的关系将会日益密切，从而为两国关系正常化铺平道路。
    中国和日本是东亚的两个重要国家。虽然我们的社会制度不同，目前所处的地位也不同，但是对于我们两国人民来说，和平都是我们最需要的东西。为了维护亚洲和平，中日两国必须而且也可以和平共处。现在的问题是帝国主义者们不希望中日两国和平共处，他们害怕这样一来，就会使它们丧失在东亚制造紧张局势、阻挠国际局势继续趋向和缓的机会。它们现在再也不能控制中国了。现在，它们想尽一切办法控制日本，侵犯日本的主权和独立，挑拨中日之间的关系，企图把日本变成它们的原子弹基地，使日本人民再次遭受到严重的战争威胁。日本社会党在外交政策和国际问题方面所抱的见解，表明日本广大人士已经越来越认识到日本必须在国际事务中发挥独立自主的作用，对亚洲和世界和平作出积极的贡献。这是一件可喜的事情。
    日本社会党访华亲善使节团的访问，使中国人民对日本有了更进一步的了解，使中日两国人民之间的友谊加强了。我们相信，通过中日两国之间更多的互相访问，两国的友好关系将会日益发展。
