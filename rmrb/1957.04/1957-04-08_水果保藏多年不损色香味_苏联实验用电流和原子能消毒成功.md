 Fruit Preserved for Years Without Loss of Color, Flavor
	Soviet Experiments Successfully Use Electricity and Atomic Energy for Disinfection

Moscow Dispatch, April 7th: New methods of using electricity and atomic energy for sterilization and disinfection to preserve fruits and berries have been successfully tested in Soviet laboratories. Pears, apples, peaches, strawberries, and raspberries, after being sterilized with high-frequency currents, can be preserved for many years and still taste as fresh as if they had just been picked from the tree. Judging from the color, flavor, and aroma of the fruits, the high-frequency current sterilization method is superior to conventional methods, and it can also preserve 95% of vitamin C. What is the secret of high-frequency current? Ordinary alternating current changes direction dozens of times per second, while high-frequency current changes direction millions of times per second. When an object is subjected to high-frequency current, its molecules oscillate and rub against each other, thus converting electrical energy into heat within the object and transmitting it throughout. Therefore, when sterilizing canned fruit with this current, the fruit heats up quickly, avoiding the phenomenon of overcooking in sugar syrup. It normally takes thirty to forty minutes to sterilize canned fruit in glass jars using autoclaves, while it only takes one or two minutes with high-frequency current. The laboratory has already manufactured an automated high-frequency current sterilizer and is testing it in a factory. The laboratory is now studying the problem of using atomic energy to preserve food. Radiation obtained from radioactive isotopes and accelerated electrons is used to sterilize glass, metal, and plastic cans. Experiments have shown that this method can preserve fresh meat for several months.

    水果保藏多年不损色香味
    苏联实验用电流和原子能消毒成功
    本报莫斯科7日电　用电流和原子能灭菌消毒以保藏水果和浆果的新方法，已经在苏联的实验室中试验成功。梨、苹果、桃、草莓、树莓，用高频率的电流灭菌以后，保藏多年，还像从树上新摘下来。从果子的色香味判断，高频率的电流灭菌法比通常方法高明，况且能保存95％丙种维他命。高频率的电流妙处何来呢？普通交流电流一秒钟几十次地变换方向，而高频率电流一秒钟几百万次地变换方向。通过高频率电流的物体，它的分子发生振荡和摩擦，因此在物体内电力转化为热并且传给全部。所以用这种电流把水果罐头消毒时，水果热得快，避免在糖汁中煮得过熟的现象。玻璃罐头的水果平常用压热器要消毒三四十分钟，而用高频率电流只要一两分钟。实验室已经制造出一种自动化的高频率电流消毒器，放在一个工厂中试验。现在实验室研究利用原子能保藏食物问题。从放射性同位素和加速的电子取得射线，把玻璃的、金属的和塑料的罐头消毒。实验证明，用这种方法可以把生肉保藏几个月。
