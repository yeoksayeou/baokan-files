Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, April 24th: A spring production upsurge, aiming to achieve a bumper harvest in agriculture this year, has emerged in the rural areas of Heilongjiang Province, where the farming season starts relatively late. Across the vast Songhua River and Nen River plains, agricultural cooperative members are busy transporting manure and sowing spring wheat in the newly thawed fields. It is understood that the preparation for spring plowing and sowing in various regions is generally faster, more efficient, and of better quality than in previous years. The manure prepared for large autumn crop fields throughout the province can supply 50% of the cultivated land. All agricultural cooperatives are paying attention to carefully selecting seeds, conducting seed germination tests, and treating seeds with pesticides to ensure good seed quality. The spring wheat sowing work, which is about to end, has seen significant improvements compared to the past. The vast majority of agricultural cooperatives have achieved meticulous preparation, the use of improved varieties, timely sowing, and flat, dense planting.

Since last winter, rural areas in Heilongjiang Province have generally been summarizing the experience of running cooperatives, rectifying agricultural cooperatives, conducting socialist propaganda and education among farmers, and mobilizing farmers to vigorously prepare for increased production. Therefore, the vast number of rural cadres and farmers have high confidence in increasing production and are full of labor enthusiasm. In various places, many agricultural cooperative members have voluntarily taken out their savings and stored goods to help the cooperative overcome difficulties. Elderly farmers in agricultural cooperatives have also put forward various methods for increasing production, contributing their valuable production experience and wisdom.

    黑龙江掀起春季生产高潮
    新华社哈尔滨24日电　争取今年农业大丰收的春季生产高潮，已经在农事季节较晚的黑龙江省农村中出现。沃野千里的松花江和嫩江平原上，到处有农业社的社员在刚刚解冻的农田里抢送粪肥和播种春麦。据了解，各地春耕播种的准备工作普遍比往年行动快、效率高，质量好。全省为大秋作物田准备的粪肥，可以供50％的耕地施用。各农业社都注意精选种子、作种子发芽试验和用农药拌种，保证了种子质量良好。即将结束的春麦播种工作，比过去有很大的改进。绝大多数农业社做到了细致整理、采用良种、适时播种和平播密植。
    黑龙江省农村去年冬季以来普遍总结办社经验，整顿农业社，向农民进行社会主义宣传教育和动员农民大力作好增产准备。因此广大农村干部和农民增产的信心很高，劳动热情饱满。各地都有不少农业社社员自动地拿出自己的存款、存物，帮助社里克服困难。各农业社中的老年农民也纷纷提出各种各样的增产办法，献出了他们宝贵的生产经验和智慧。
