Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The first four volumes of "Mo Ruo's Collected Works" were published by the People's Literature Publishing House on March 31st and will be distributed in Beijing in early April.

The complete collection of works contains approximately four million characters, collecting Guo Moruo's literary works from 1918 to the present, spanning nearly forty years. The first four volumes include poetry, drama, novels, autobiography, essays, literary criticism, literary and political essays, and academic works, which will be published successively. The collection will consist of more than ten volumes and is expected to be completed next year. The author's archaeological works and translated foreign works will be published separately.

Guo Moruo began personally proofreading most of the works in the collection a year ago, making revisions to some of them and adding some necessary annotations.

Following the publication of "Mo Ruo's Collected Works," the People's Literature Publishing House will also successively edit and publish the collected works of writers such as Mao Dun, Ye Shengtao, Yu Dafu, Lao She, and Ba Jin.
