    Drinking Song
    Heinrich Heine
    Drink deeply, brothers, let us drink deeply,
    Let us fall drunk to the ground and not wake up;
    But ah, we must pray to God,
    Lest the kings also indulge in drinking.
    For ah, the kings, without even touching their cups,
    Have already shattered half the world;
    If ah, they were all tipsy and drunk,
    Who knows what grave sins they would commit.
    (Translated from the German "Book of Songs" by Ji Kun)

    祝饮歌
    亨利希·海?
    痛饮吧，弟兄们，让我们痛饮，
    让我们醉倒在地上不醒；
    可是啊，我们要祷告上帝，
    切莫叫君王们也都纵饮。
    因为啊，君王们未曾沾杯
    就已把这世界一半粉碎；
    要是啊他们都醉意醺醺，
    更不知会犯下何等重罪。
    （纪　琨译自德文“谐趣集”）
