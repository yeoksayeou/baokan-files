    "A Concise History of Philosophy" Published

    A popular book providing a simple introduction to the history of philosophy, "A Concise History of Philosophy," has been published by the People's Publishing House.

    "A Concise History of Philosophy" is divided into three parts, totaling over 200,000 words. The first part discusses the history of Western philosophy before Marxism, from ancient Greek and Roman philosophy to the philosophy of 19th-century Russian revolutionary democrats. The second part is the history of Marxist-Leninist philosophy, and it critically introduces many reactionary philosophical schools of modern bourgeoisie. The third part is the history of Chinese philosophy, from the Yin and Zhou Dynasties and the Warring States period to the May Fourth Movement.

    This book is written to meet the needs of general readers who have not studied the history of philosophy. It mainly provides concise introductions, evaluations, or critiques of the basic ideas and historical backgrounds of important philosophical schools and philosophers in each period. In the narrative, it focuses on the basic questions of philosophy, the opposition and struggle between materialism and idealism. The many extremely complex relationships between various philosophical thoughts in history are written in a relatively simple manner.

    This book was written by comrades from the Foreign Philosophy History Teaching and Research Section of the Philosophy Department of Peking University. During the writing process, it referenced and integrated the philosophy history lecture notes of several Soviet experts and the lecture notes of the Foreign Philosophy History and Chinese Philosophy History Teaching and Research Sections of Peking University. Since this book was written before the "Hundred Flowers Blooming" policy was proposed, some new opinions in the academic community on the study of the history of philosophy in the past year or so have not been reflected in this book. Because the authors' current research on the philosophies of the East and other countries is insufficient, the philosophies of these countries are not discussed. This cannot but be considered a shortcoming. Some of the views and conclusions in this book also need to be discussed by everyone. (Jiang Xia)

    “哲学史简编”出版
    一部简单介绍哲学史的通俗读物——哲学史简编，已由人民出版社出版。
    哲学史简编共分三篇，计二十余万字。第一篇是讲马克思主义以前的西方哲学史，从古希腊罗马哲学讲到十九世纪俄国革命民主主义者的哲学。第二篇是马克思列宁主义哲学史，并批判地介绍了现代资产阶级许多反动哲学派别。第三篇是中国哲学史，从殷周战国叙述到五四运动。
    这本书是为适应一般没有学过哲学史的读者的需要而编写的，它主要是把各个时期中重要哲学派别和哲学家的基本思想及其时代背景作简括的介绍、估价或批判。在叙述时是以哲学基本问题、以唯物主义与唯心主义的对立与斗争的问题为中心，至于历史上各派哲学思想彼此间许多极其错综复杂的关系则写得比较简单。
    这本书是北京大学哲学系外国哲学史教研室的同志编写的。编写时参考、综合了好几位苏联专家的哲学史讲稿和北京大学外国哲学史与中国哲学史教研室的讲稿。由于这本书写成于“百家争鸣”的政策提出之前，因此，最近一年多以来学术界对研究哲学史的某些新意见没有在本书中得到反映。由于作者目前对东方和其他各国哲学研究得不够，没有讲到这些国家的哲学。这不能不认为是一个缺点。这本书的某些观点和结论也还需要大家共同讨论。　（江夏）
