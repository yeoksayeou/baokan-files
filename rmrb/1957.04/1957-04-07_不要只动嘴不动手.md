    Since the agricultural cooperativization movement last year, the CCP Lu Long County Committee in Hebei Province has adopted a very poor working method: whenever a County Committee member goes to the countryside to guide and help with work, each one brings a section or division-level cadre to write reports on their behalf. The county has more than twenty County Committee members, with more than ten regularly going to the countryside. This means that more than ten people are regularly acting as temporary report-writing secretaries for the County Committee members.
    Each County Committee member typically takes charge of an area covering two or three townships. It should be said that there isn't much material to write; moreover, the townships regularly send reports directly to the County Committee office about their work. Each secretary writes a report for the committee member at most every three days. This situation shows that County Committee members bringing secretaries is not necessary.
    Furthermore, are these County Committee members incapable of writing reports? No. They are all capable of writing. County Committee member and Culture and Education Minister, Comrade Pei Xiaojun, was originally a County Committee secretary, very skilled at writing reports and materials, but now he also brings a secretary when he goes to the countryside.
    This situation reminds me of Minister Lu of the CCP Tangshan Prefectural Committee Propaganda Department (a standing committee member of the Prefectural Committee). When he came to Lu Long last year to help with work, he didn't bring anyone with him, but the work situation was still reported, and he also wrote articles for the Tangshan Peasant Newspaper. In terms of need, Minister Lu may have needed a secretary even more, but he didn't bring one, and did everything himself. This is very worthy of learning from.
    Currently, the whole country is making every effort to strive for a bumper agricultural harvest this year, and many places have drawn cadres to strengthen the grassroots and lead agricultural production. However, Lu Long County is wasting manpower, which is clearly not good. I hope the Lu Long County Committee can change this working method.

    不要只动嘴不动手
    孙连庆
    从去年农业合作化运动以后，中共河北省卢龙县委采取了一个很不好的工作方法，就是每当县委委员下乡指导和帮助工作的时候，每人都带着一名科、股长级干部，专门替这位委员写汇报材料。全县共有二十多名县委委员，经常下乡的在十名以上，这样，经常就要有十多人充当县委委员的临时写材料秘书。
    每个县委委员下乡，一般都是包起一片，范围是两三个乡。应当说，这没有多少材料要写；况且各乡的工作情况，各乡也经常直接向县委办公室写汇报。每个委员让秘书写的汇报也是最多三天一次。这个情况说明县委委员带秘书并不是必需的。
    另外，这些县委委员是不是不能写材料呢？不是。他们都能写。县委委员、文教部长裴晓军同志原是县委会秘书，写汇报、写材料很内行，可是现在他下乡也要带着秘书。
    这个情况使我想起了中共唐山地委宣传部的陆部长（地委常务委员），他在去年来卢龙帮助工作的时候，什么人都没有带，可是工作情况也反映上去了，另外他还给唐山农民报写了稿件。论需要，陆部长也许更需要秘书，可是他没有带，一切都亲自动手做了，这是很值得学习的。
    现在，全国正在尽一切努力争取今年的农业大丰收，许多地方都抽出了干部充实基层，领导农业生产。可是卢龙县却在浪费着人力，这显然是不好的，我希望卢龙县委能够改变这个工作方法。
