Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, April 14th: The Third Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee, which concluded yesterday, devoted ample time to seriously discussing the question of how to correctly handle contradictions among the people. The meeting requested CPPCC members to better strengthen consultative work and ideological remolding work in the future, in order to mobilize all positive factors and promote the construction undertakings of the autonomous region.

The meeting conveyed Chairman Mao Zedong's speech on the correct handling of contradictions among the people at the Supreme State Conference. The members discussed this speech and, in conjunction with discussing the work of the autonomous region, fully promoted democracy and carried out criticism. The meeting finally unanimously adopted the resolution on vigorously carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy.

The resolution requires all members and CPPCC organizations at all levels to closely link with the masses, implement various policies, continue to strengthen consultation and ideological remolding work, earnestly pay attention to the correct resolution of contradictions among the people, mobilize all positive factors, and promote the development of various socialist construction undertakings in the autonomous region, in accordance with the national characteristics and regional characteristics of the autonomous region. To this end, the resolution requires that all state organs, schools, enterprises, and institutions in the autonomous region must do everything possible to tap potential, increase production, practice strict economy, eliminate extravagance and waste, and promote hard work and plain living, and vigorously publicize the great significance of increasing production and practicing economy through various speeches, symposiums, and special lectures.

At the meeting, CPPCC members fully promoted democracy in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism and put forward criticisms and suggestions on the existing problems in the leadership work of the Party and government at all levels. The members put forward sharp criticisms, especially on the low quality of local industrial products, the waste in public medical care, and the low quality of teachers in secondary schools. Due to the bureaucracy and generalization of leadership methods in some leading organs, some shortcomings have brought losses to the work. Some members criticized that due to the lack of complete planning in the urban construction of Hohhot, each building is equipped with a boiler. The one hundred and eight buildings in Hohhot have one hundred and five chimneys, water towers, and water tanks, which are neither beautiful nor wasteful. Last year alone, the construction of chimneys cost four million yuan. Some members also raised their opinions on the fact that the postal and telecommunications departments do not pay attention to the distribution of publications within the autonomous region. The postal and telecommunications departments often accumulate and delay delivery, causing dissatisfaction among the masses. Some people at the meeting said that when people on the grassland could not subscribe to magazines at the post office or buy them at the bookstore, they put forward the following opinions to the editors of magazines such as "Hongyan": "Could it be that you dislike this place because it is cold and do not fly to us here?" During the meeting, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China also specially invited all members to hold a forum in order to solicit the opinions of CPPCC members on the leadership work of the Party committees at all levels.

    政协内蒙古委员会举行第三次全体会议
    讨论处理人民内部矛盾的问题
    新华社呼和浩特14日电　昨天结束的中国人民政治协商会议内蒙古自治区委员会第三次全体会议，以充分的时间认真讨论了如何正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题。会议要求政协委员们今后要更好地加强协商工作和思想改造工作，以调动一切积极因素，推进自治区的建设事业。
    会上传达了毛泽东主席在最高国务会议上关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的讲话，委员们讨论了这个讲话，而且结合讨论自治区的工作，充分发扬了民主，开展了批评。会议最后一致通过了大力开展增产节约运动的决议。
    决议要求全体委员和政协各级组织，应根据自治区的民族特点和地区特点，密切联系群众，贯彻各项政策，继续加强协商和思想改造工作，切实注意人民内部矛盾的正确解决，调动一切积极因素，促进自治区社会主义各项建设事业的发展。为此，决议要求目前自治区的所有国家机关、学校、企业和事业单位，必须千方百计地挖掘潜力，增加生产，厉行节约，杜绝铺张浪费，提倡艰苦朴素，并且通过各种讲演、座谈、专题讲座等方式，大力宣传增产节约的重大意义。
    会上，政协委员们以批评与自我批评的精神充分的发扬了民主，对各级党的和政府的领导工作上存在的问题，提出了批评和建议。委员们特别对地方工业产品质量低、公费医疗中的浪费现象和中等学校师资质量低等提出了尖锐的批评。由于有些领导机关的官僚主义和领导方法的一般化，有些缺点已给工作带来了损失。有的委员批评呼和浩特城市建设中由于缺乏完整规划，每幢楼房都装置一个锅炉，呼和浩特建筑的一百零八幢楼房，就有一百零五个烟囱、水塔和水箱，既不美观，而又浪费。去年仅建筑烟囱就花费了四百万元。有些委员对邮电部门不重视自治区内的刊物发行也提出了意见，邮电部门经常积压，延期投递，引起群众不满。会上有的人说，当草原上的人们在邮局订不到、书店买不到杂志时，便向“鸿雁”等杂志编辑部提出了这样的意见：“莫非嫌我们这地方冷，不向我们这里飞吗？”在会议期间，中共内蒙古自治区委员会为了征求政协委员们对各级党委领导工作的意见，还专门邀请全体委员举行了座谈会。
