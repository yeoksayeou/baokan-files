Xinhua News Agency, April 13th. Egyptian Ambassador to China, Hassan Ragheb, stated at a press conference held in Beijing this morning that Israel's recent provocative actions in the demilitarized zone indicate its intention to re-attack Egypt, using these incidents as a pretext to launch a new offensive.

    Ambassador Hassan Ragheb's remarks refer to Israel's refusal to withdraw its troops from Taba and Naqeb, and its refusal to allow UN forces to be stationed in Auja, a demilitarized zone on the Egyptian-Israeli border.

    The ambassador also strongly condemned Israel's statements threatening the use of force, its continued aggression, and the Israeli army's destruction of the ceasefire line, massacre of peaceful Egyptian residents, looting of property, and kidnapping of innocent residents.

    Ambassador Ragheb said, "All these actions clearly demonstrate that Israel, despite the presence of the United Nations Emergency Force, continues to maintain its disregard for the United Nations Charter and resolutions." He further stated, "This state of aggression and provocation from Israel, if continued, will only lead to instability and insecurity in the Middle East, thereby seriously endangering the peace of this part of the world and hindering its economic and social development."

    When asked for his opinion on the passage of an American oil tanker through the Straits of Tiran to Israel, the ambassador said that Egypt has every right to protest this matter. He said, "Because any ship must obtain Egypt's permission to pass through this strait."

    Ambassador Ragheb said, "Egypt is not discriminating between Israeli ships and the ships of other countries passing through the Gulf of Aqaba and the Suez Canal; it is merely exercising its legitimate right not to allow any enemy ships to enter its own territorial waters." He explained that the only condition for passage is to obtain the permission of the Egyptian government.

    Ambassador Ragheb pointed out that as long as Israel does not resolve the issue of the millions of Arab refugees expelled from that region, the state of war between Egypt and Israel will continue. As long as this situation exists, Egypt will continue to deny enemy ships the right to enter Egyptian territorial waters.

### 埃及驻华大使拉加卜  严斥以色列企图重新玩火

    埃及驻华大使拉加卜
    严斥以色列企图重新玩火
    新华社13日讯　埃及驻华大使哈桑·拉加卜今天上午在北京举行的记者招待会上说，以色列最近在非军事区的挑衅行为，表明它打算重新进攻埃及，利用这些事件作为发动新的攻势的借口。
    哈桑·拉加卜大使的这些话指的是以色列拒绝自塔巴和纳奎布角撤兵，并且拒绝让联合国部队在埃—以边境上的非军事区的奥贾驻扎这件事。
    大使还强烈谴责以色列扬言要使用武力的声明，谴责它继续侵略，并且谴责以色列军队破坏停战线，屠杀埃及的和平居民，劫掠财物，绑架无辜居民。
    拉加卜大使说，“所有这些行动清楚地表明，以色列不顾联合国紧急部队驻在那里，仍然保持着它的无视联合国宪章和决议的态度。”他又说，“这种来自以色列的侵略和挑衅状态继续下去，只会导致中东的动荡和不安全的状态，因而严重地危害世界这一部分地区的和平，并且阻碍它的经济和社会发展。”
    有人要求他就一艘美国油船通过蒂朗海峡驶向以色列这件事发表意见，大使说，埃及完全有权对这件事提出抗议。他说，“因为任何船只要通过这一海峡都必须得到埃及的许可。”
    拉加卜大使说，“埃及不是在通过亚喀巴湾和苏伊士运河的以色列船只和其他国家的船只之间有所歧视，它只不过是利用不让任何敌船进入它自己的领水这一合法权利罢了。”他解释说，通航的唯一条件就是要得到埃及政府的允许。
    拉加卜大使指出，只要以色列不解决被驱逐出那个地区的成百万阿拉伯难民的问题，埃及和以色列之间的战争状态就将继续下去。只要这一事态存在，埃及就将继续不给敌船以进入埃及领水的权利。
