    The Main Tasks of Albania's Second Five-Year Plan
    By Pi Kosta, Minister of Finance and Trade of the Albanian Labor Party
    Thanks to the hard work of workers, peasants, and intellectuals, under the leadership of the Party and the government, and with the help of the Soviet Union, China, and other people's democratic countries, Albania successfully completed its first Five-Year Plan (1951-1955), transforming itself from a backward agricultural country into a relatively advanced agricultural-industrial country.
    During the first Five-Year Plan, we laid the foundation for socialist industrialization. Before liberation, Albania's industry was extremely backward. Besides the tobacco and timber processing industries, there was hardly any industry. In 1955, the total value of socialist industrial production accounted for 43.5% of the total value of industrial and agricultural production, equivalent to eleven times that of 1938.
    In agriculture, we made certain achievements in increasing the yield per unit area and expanding the cultivated area after liberation. In 1955, the agricultural output value was equivalent to 163% of that in 1938; during the same period, the cultivated area increased by 70%.
    Although our animal husbandry suffered great losses during World War II, by 1955, the number of various livestock had exceeded pre-war levels.
    Due to the rapid development of industry and agriculture, national income increased by 70% during the first Five-Year Plan, workers' and staff's wages increased by 20%, and farmers' income increased by 35%.
    The volume of commodities circulating in the market in 1955 was 205% of that in 1950. New industrial sectors' products appeared on the market: cotton textiles, rubber industry products, and glassware.
    The achievements of the first Five-Year Plan laid a solid foundation for the implementation of the second Five-Year Plan (1956-1960).
    The main tasks of the second Five-Year Plan, as proposed by the Third National Congress of the Party, are: by 1960, the industrial output value will be 192% of that in 1955, with the machine-building industry increasing by 202% and the production of consumer goods increasing by 184%. The total value of industrial and agricultural production in the second Five-Year Plan will be three times that of the first Five-Year Plan period. In 1960, the industrial output value will account for 49.6% of the total value of industrial and agricultural production. In five years, labor productivity will increase by 62%, and the cost of industrial products will decrease by 18%.
    The industrial policy of the second Five-Year Plan is to: fully utilize existing equipment, widely utilize various domestic raw materials; tap potential, improve labor productivity; improve product quality, increase new products, and reduce product prices.
    We must vigorously increase the speed of development of the mining industry. To this end, we must strengthen geological prospecting, open new oil wells, increase the production of coal, chromium, copper, and asphalt, and exploit iron ore in our country for the first time.
    During this Five-Year Plan, the state will pay attention to the development of the machine-building industry, so that 40% of the machines needed by the country will be manufactured domestically.
    In order to better meet the needs of the people, the state will further develop basic construction and light industry, especially the textile and food industries.
    The Party attaches importance to the development of agriculture. In the second Five-Year Plan, agriculture will have greater development. In 1960, the agricultural output value will increase by 50% compared with 1955. Grain production should fully meet the needs of the country, and the supply of raw materials for light industry and the food industry will also be satisfied. It is necessary to increase the supply and export of agricultural products. The guarantee for completing these tasks is the collectivization of agriculture. It is estimated that in 1960, the cultivated area of agricultural production cooperatives will reach 70% of the total cultivated area of the country, while in 1955 it only accounted for 13%. Therefore, agricultural collectivization is a very important task in our country's second Five-Year Plan.
    The total investment of the state in the second Five-Year Plan will increase by 27% compared with the first Five-Year Plan period, of which 80.4% will be used for industrial and agricultural production.
    The completion of the second Five-Year Plan will significantly improve the material and cultural living standards of the people. National income will increase by 53%, workers' and staff's wages will increase by 25%, and farmers' income will increase by 38%. As the people's purchasing power increases, the amount of commodities supplied to the people will increase by 42% compared with the first Five-Year Plan. In order to improve the people's living conditions, the residential area in cities and industrial centers will increase by 47%.
    In 1960, the total number of students in the country will increase by 31% compared with 1955. In order to better protect the people's health, the government will take active measures to make hospitals and sanatoriums better serve the people. It is necessary to increase clinics, expand the training of midwives, and vigorously carry out the work of preventing infectious diseases. In five years, the number of hospitals will increase by 23%.
    With the upsurge of the national economy, our country's foreign economic ties will also be strengthened. Commodity exports will increase by 40.2%.
    In order to better complete the plan for developing the national economy, the Party attaches special importance to learning from the experience of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries that are building socialism. This time, our Albanian government trade delegation came to China with this purpose.
    We have seen that the Chinese people have achieved brilliant achievements in many aspects under the leadership of the Communist Party. We have seen that in factories, in farms, in commercial enterprises, and in various positions, the Chinese people are working diligently and enthusiastically to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, to improve their material and cultural living standards, and to strengthen national defense. This is the guarantee of the Chinese people's bright future and happy life. We are very excited about this and sincerely congratulate the Chinese people on achieving greater success in the labor of building socialism. The Albanian people are encouraged by the victory of the Chinese people, and we regard your achievements as the achievements of our common cause.
    The second Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy of the People's Republic of Albania will greatly improve our country's productivity, and it will be a new milestone on our country's road to building socialism.

    阿尔巴尼亚第二个五年计划的主要任务
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央财政贸易部长  皮·考斯塔
    由于工人、农民和知识分子的辛勤劳动，在党和政府的领导下和苏联、中国及其他人民民主国家的帮助下，阿尔巴尼亚胜利地完成了第一个五年计划（1951—1955年），它已由一个落后的农业国变成了一个比较进步的农业工业国家。
    在第一个五年计划期间，我们打下了社会主义工业化的基础。解放前，阿尔巴尼亚的工业极端落后，除了制烟、木材加工工业外，几乎没有什么工业。而在1955年，社会主义工业生产总值已占工农业生产总值的43.5％，相当于1938年的十一倍。
    农业方面，解放后在提高单位面积产量和扩大耕地面积上都有一定的成绩。1955年农业产值相当于1938年的163％；在同时期内，耕地面积扩大了70％。
    虽然我国畜牧业在第二次世界大战中遭到很大损失，但在1955年，各种牲畜的头数都已超过了战前。
    由于工农业的迅速发展，在第一个五年计划中国民收入增加了70％，工人和职员的工资增加了20％，农民的收入增加了35％。
    1955年市场上流通的商品为1950年的205％。在市场上出现了新的工业部门的产品：棉纺织品，橡胶工业产品，玻璃器皿。
    第一个五年计划所取得的成就，为实行第二个五年计划（1956—1960年）打下了牢固的基础。
    党的第三次全国代表大会提出的第二个五年计划的主要任务是：在1960年，工业产值将为1955年的192％，其中机器制造工业增长为202％，消费品生产增长为184％。第二个五年计划中的工农业生产总值将是第一个五年计划期间的三倍。1960年工业产值在工农生产总值中将占49.6％。五年中，劳动生产率将提高62％，工业品成本将降低18％。
    第二个五年计划在工业上的方针是：充分利用现有设备，广泛利用各种国产原料；挖掘潜力，提高劳动生产率；提高产品质量，增加新产品，降低产品价格。
    我们要大力增加采矿业发展的速度。为此我们必须加强地质勘探工作，开凿新的油井，增加煤、铬、铜和沥青等等矿产的产量，并在我国第一次开采铁矿。
    在这个五年计划期间，国家将重视机器制造业的发展，要使国家需要的40％的机器在本国制造。
    为了更好地满足人民的需要，国家将进一步发展基本建设，发展轻工业，尤其是纺织工业和食品工业。
    党重视农业的发展。在第二个五年计划中，农业将有较大的发展。1960年农业产值将比1955年增加50％。谷物生产要完全满足国家需要，轻工业、食品工业的原料供应也将得到满足。要增加农产品的供应和出口。完成这些任务的保证是农业的合作化。预计在1960年，农业生产合作社耕地面积将达全国耕地总面积的70％，而1955年只占13％。因此，农业合作化是我国第二个五年计划中一项十分重要的任务。
    第二个五年计划中国家的总投资将比第一个五年计划时期增加27％，其中80.4％用在工农业生产上。
    第二个五年计划的完成，将使人民的物质和文化生活水平显著提高。国民收入将增加53％，工人和职员的工资将增加25％，农民收入将增加38％。随着人民购买力的提高，供应人民的商品量将比第一个五年计划增加42％。为了改善人民的居住条件，城市及工业中心的住宅面积将增加47％。
    1960年全国学生总数将比1955年增加31％。为了更好地保障人民健康，政府将采取积极措施，使医院、疗养院更好地为人民服务。要增加门诊所，扩大助产士的训练，大力进行预防传染病的工作。五年中，医院的数目将增加23％。
    随着国民经济的高涨，我国对外经济联系也将加强。商品出口将增加40.2％。
    为了更好地完成发展国民经济的计划，党特别重视学习正在建设社会主义的苏联和人民民主国家的经验。这次我们阿尔巴尼亚政府贸易代表团来到中国就抱着这样的目的。
    我们看到，中国人民在共产党的领导下在许多方面都获得了光辉的成就。我们看到，在工厂，在农庄，在商业企业，在各个岗位上，中国人民都在为巩固工农联盟，为提高自己的物质文化生活水平和加强国防力量，而勤劳地、热情地工作着。这是中国人民光明未来的幸福生活的保证。我们为此感到十分兴奋，并且衷心地祝贺中国人民在建设社会主义的劳动中获得更大的成就。阿尔巴尼亚人民为中国人民的胜利所鼓舞，我们把你们的成就看成是我们共同事业的成就。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国发展国民经济的第二个五年计划将大大提高我国的生产力，它将是我国建设社会主义道路上的新的里程碑。
                                            （本报特约稿）（附图片）
