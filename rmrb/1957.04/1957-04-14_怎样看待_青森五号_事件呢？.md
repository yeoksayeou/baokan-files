    How to View the "Aomori No. 5" Incident?

    The People's Daily published an article by Comrade Yi Nong on March 29th, third edition, titled "Learn from Last Year's Experience to Better Promote Agricultural Production Increase Measures," which I believe is correct. However, I have fundamental disagreements with the article's statements regarding the promotion of the "Aomori No. 5" rice variety in Hunan and Hubei.

    China has a vast territory with complex terrain and climate. Even within a mountain range, there can be significant differences, as is the case with the Qinling Mountains, north and south. Agricultural technicians are both scarce and often lack sufficient expertise at the grassroots level. Furthermore, many agricultural science problems remain unsolved. Therefore, some shortcomings and errors in agricultural technology reform and good seed promotion are inevitable, which is entirely understandable. Consequently, more careful and thorough analysis and research are needed before implementing good seed promotion. In the past year's promotion of "Aomori No. 5," agricultural leadership departments did not do this; they easily approved the transfer of seeds from the Northeast to the two lakes (Hunan and Hubei) for promotion.

    Regarding the promotion of good seeds, the Central Ministry of Agriculture stipulated that trial planting should precede widespread promotion and repeatedly emphasized this. However, the Ministry of Agriculture itself violated its own regulations.

    Comrade Yi Nong said, "Whether the 'Aomori No. 5' rice variety is fundamentally unsuitable for planting in the two lakes still needs to be confirmed by scientific experiments and multiple trials." This is correct, but it fails to point out what responsibilities the agricultural leadership departments should bear. If the Ministry of Agriculture's regulations had been followed scientifically through trial planting, the losses caused by "Aomori No. 5" in the two lakes could have been entirely avoided. It is absolutely not, as Comrade Yi Nong said, "Such things are inherently unavoidable in new endeavors." Comrade Yi Nong's statement essentially says, "Promoting without trial planting is unavoidable!" Isn't this precisely an attempt to cover up the agricultural leadership departments' hasty actions? He then said, "However, it has also received excessive criticism and accusations, which has hurt the emotions of cadres and the masses." In other words, whoever criticizes or accuses will hurt the emotions of cadres and the masses, so everyone will keep silent. This kind of anti-criticism rhetoric has rarely appeared in newspapers in recent years. Now, let's look at the facts:

    Comrade Yi Nong said "A part... did not grow well..." But the fact is "the good were few, the bad were many," and the peasants suffered losses. Some said, "The seeds came from afar, with no grain and short stalks; there was no trial planting beforehand, truly harming people." Who pointed this out? Can these reasonable demands of the peasants be considered "excessive criticism"? Comrade Yi Nong also said in the article, "Some of these mistakes were caused by grassroots cadres mechanically implementing the regulations of higher authorities, and some cadres even adopted coercive methods, which of course were wrong." Generally speaking, this is correct, but it does not apply to the "Aomori No. 5" incident (Comrade Yi Nong did not specify that the "Aomori No. 5" incident was not included). Think about it: When the higher authorities send seeds and order planting, cadres cannot be flexible enough to not plant them. Clearly, it is not "excessive criticism and accusations" that "hurt the emotions of cadres and the masses," but the promotion of "Aomori No. 5" itself.

    If we are to, as Comrade Yi Nong said, "first protect the enthusiasm of these cadres" and avoid hurting the emotions of the masses, I believe the best way is to face the facts and have each department and each person bear the responsibilities they should bear. Pushing everything onto objective factors, with the agricultural leadership departments remaining silent, no matter how large the accusations, will not stop everyone's criticism and accusations, and the emotions of the peasants and cadres will not be high.

    In summary, I believe that Comrade Yi Nong's article on the "Aomori No. 5" incident contains significant one-sidedness in its facts and arguments. The Ministry of Agriculture and the Hunan Provincial Department of Agriculture should explain the causes and consequences and scientific basis of the "Aomori No. 5" incident to the people, and implement the spirit of "higher-level leadership departments should bear responsibility" that Comrade Yi Nong mentioned. (Author's note: Regarding the "Aomori No. 5" introduction issue, the facts I have based on are from materials published in the People's Daily on October 12, 1956.)

### 怎样看待“青森五号”事件呢？

    怎样看待“青森五号”事件呢？
    人民日报3月29日第三版发表了益农同志的“吸取去年的经验更好地推行农业增产措施”一文，我认为是正确的。但对文中涉及的湖南、湖北推广“青森五号”稻种的说法，却有原则上的不同意见。
    我国幅员广大，地形气候复杂，甚至一山之隔就有很大区别，如秦岭南北就是这样，农业技术干部在基层既缺乏而水平又多不够高；并且有许多问题在农业科学上还没有解决，所以在农业技术改革和推广良种工作中不可避免的会发生一些缺点和错误，这是完全可以理解的。因此在推广良种工作中就需要更仔细慎重地分析研究然后实行。在去年推广“青森五号”上农业领导部门并没有这样作，轻易批准将东北的种子调到两湖来推广。
    推广良种，中央农业部曾规定先试种再推广，并一再强调过。但农业部自己破坏了自己的规定。
    益农同志说：“‘青森五号’稻种在两湖是否根本不能种植，还有待科学试验和多次试种的结果才能肯定。”这是对的。但是没有指出农业领导部门应负何种责任。假如能按科学道理执行农业部规定，经过试种，则“青森五号”在两湖造成的损失是完全可以避免的。绝对不像益农同志说的“这种事本来也是在新生事物中难以避免的”。益农同志这种说法简直在说“不试种就推广是难以避免的”！这不正是掩饰农业领导部门草率从事的缺点吗？接着又说：“但是，也受到了过多的批评和指责，伤害了干部和农民群众的情绪。”也就是说，谁要指责批评，谁就伤害了干部和农民的情绪，这样大家就会缄口不言了。这种反对批评的论调，是数年来在报纸上很少出现的。现在再让我们来看看事实：
    益农同志说“有一部……生长不好……”，但事实上是“好的是少数，坏的是多数”，农民受到了损失。有的说出了“种子来的远，无谷又无管（禾秆短小），事先没试种，害人真不浅”的话，这是谁指责出来的？农民这种合理要求能认为是“过多的指责”吗？益农同志在文章里又说过，“这些错误，有的是基层干部机械执行上级规定搞出来的，有些干部甚至采用了强迫命令的办法，当然他们是有错误的”；一般说来这是对的。但对“青森五号”事件却不适用（益农同志未注明不包括“青森五号”事件）。请想：上级发来了种子命令种植，干部无论如何不能灵活到不种。很显然“伤害了干部和农民群众的情绪”的，不是“受到了过多的批评和指责”，而是推广“青森五号”这件事。
    要如益农同志所说，“对这些干部，首先是保护他们的积极性”，和不伤害农民群众的情绪，我认为最好的办法是正视事实，每一部门每一人员负起他们应负的责任。一切都推到客观上，农业领导部门一语不发，不论扣的帽子多大，也杜绝不了大家的批评和指责，有关农民和干部的情绪也不会高涨。
    总之，我认为益农同志文章里对“青森五号”事件的事实和论点带有很大的片面性。农业部和湖南农业厅应该将“青森五号”事件的前因后果和科学根据向人民讲清楚，并将益农同志所说的“上级领导部门应承担责任”的精神贯彻进去。（作者注：关于“青森五号”引种问题，我所根据的事实是1956年10月12日人民日报上发表的材料。）
