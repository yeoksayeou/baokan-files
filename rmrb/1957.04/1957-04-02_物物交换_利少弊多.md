    Barter Trade Does More Harm Than Good
    Yang Li
    In 1956, when the supply of certain raw materials was tight, many enterprises, in order to overcome difficulties, adjusted some raw materials among themselves in the spirit of mutual support and exchange of needed goods. This enabled many stockpiled materials to be fully utilized. This played a positive role in overcoming the shortage of raw materials and helping enterprises to better complete their production and capital construction plans. However, judging from the current situation, "exchange of needed goods" has developed into grabbing materials everywhere for "barter trade." It has developed from the industrial and capital construction departments to the commercial departments, and has even gradually formed a "free market" for "barter trade." Along with this, many malpractices have emerged, causing much chaos. Now it seems that this approach is doing more harm than good.
    The original purpose of "exchange of needed goods" was to better utilize raw materials, eliminate the phenomenon of surpluses and shortages, and alleviate the difficulties in material supply. However, since its development into "barter trade," each unit must find another material to exchange with other units in order to obtain the materials it needs. In this situation, the more materials (especially materials most lacking in the country) a unit has in reserve, the greater its "capital" for exchange with others, and the better its material supply problems will be solved. This prompts many enterprises to grab as many materials as possible, regardless of whether they need them or not. As a result, some units have transferred a large number of personnel to purchase materials everywhere, grabbing materials whenever they see them. The Nanjing First Industrial Bureau transferred more than 30 cadres, borrowed a lot of funds, and specially established a "Materials Management Office," and also set up "offices" in Shanghai, Beijing and other places, purchasing materials everywhere regardless of whether they were needed or not. They also increased "handling fees" for "agency" materials, purchased cars, treated guests to meals, and planned to build warehouses. Some people called it a "materials trust." In this way, free exchange was carried out without organized leadership. The materials that this unit can take out to exchange are often not what another unit urgently needs. And sometimes, in order to exchange for some materials they need, some units have to go through several hands, exchange several times, and even go to other places to exchange, unnecessarily increasing the circulation process of materials. In order to facilitate "exchange," the more scarce materials are in the country, the more they become the object of competition, resulting in "the more scarce the materials, the more they are contested; the more they are contested, the more scarce they become," artificially creating an atmosphere of tight supply. This not only wastes a lot of manpower, causes roundabout transportation of materials, and increases the cost of enterprises, but also makes many units accumulate a lot of materials that they do not urgently need or do not need at all, which in turn makes the supply of materials even tighter.
    At the beginning, "barter trade" was only carried out between some industrial and construction enterprises, but later the scope of circulation expanded, and commercial departments also participated. Many commercial units also require the purchasing departments to exchange steel and wood when selling means of production, otherwise they will not sell. Some commercial departments in Shenyang City have even developed to the point where they require enterprises to exchange pig iron for white cloth and cotton-padded coats. Later on, some units that produce raw materials or machines also regarded their finished products as "capital" for exchange. Forest industrial enterprises exchange wood for steel; iron and steel enterprises exchange pig iron or steel for machinery and equipment. As a result, the state's planned supply was disrupted to a certain extent, and the role of planned management was weakened.
    In the end, "barter trade" not only fueled the development of departmentalism, but also led to acts of fraud, hoarding, and profiteering in some enterprises and units, and even corruption and theft. Some purchasing personnel impersonated local enterprises to fraudulently purchase materials, and fraudulently obtained materials by falsely signing "exchange agreements," while others used the means of treating guests and giving gifts to build "relationships." Individual units have even developed to the point of hoarding and taking advantage of other enterprises' urgent needs to demand high prices. Some units even exchanged two tons of steel for a car horn; five kilograms of wire for one ton of electrolytic copper. This has turned the original relationship of mutual support and exchange of needed goods between some enterprises into mutual coercion and deception. The egoistic ideology has gradually eroded some staff members of our socialist enterprises. It is especially worth noting that under the cover of "barter trade," our vigilance against the erosion of these ideologies has been paralyzed.
    At present, the quantity, variety, and specifications of certain materials produced by the state cannot fully meet the actual needs, and the supply plan is not sufficiently linked with the production and capital construction plans. This situation is still difficult to completely overcome for the time being. There are still some shortcomings in the allocation of materials. Under these circumstances, in order to fully tap the potential of stockpiled materials and overcome the current difficulties in material supply, it is even more necessary to carry out the work of "exchange of needed goods" and rational allocation. However, "exchange of needed goods" should be carried out through organized and led rational balancing and allocation, and should not be left to its own devices.
    Some people believe that there are many difficulties in the current unified balancing and allocation work, and although "barter trade" has many drawbacks, there is no better way to replace it. This statement is worth studying. In the past few years, the materials supply departments at all levels have organized and carried out many balancing and allocation tasks and achieved great results. After the material supply became difficult in 1956, some units, under the guidance of the idea of "preparing more is better than preparing less," always wanted to stockpile more materials in case of emergency and were unwilling to allocate their surplus materials. This situation did bring difficulties to the unified balancing and allocation work. However, the more important reason why the balancing and allocation work became more and more difficult later on was that many leading organs and materials supply departments could not grasp the inventory situation well. They were unclear about the situation and had no idea; coupled with the popularity of "barter trade," which fueled the development of departmentalism, it created many obstacles to the unified balancing and allocation work. If we can actively take effective measures, these difficulties are not insurmountable.
    Therefore, we believe that relevant departments need to quickly take measures to strengthen the unified balancing and allocation work and gradually stop the spontaneous "barter trade" method. First of all, it is necessary to thoroughly understand the inventory situation of each unit, further improve the reserve system, and distinguish between reasonable reserves and excessive and premature unreasonable reserves. This is an important prerequisite for organizing balancing and allocation. In the balancing and allocation work, in addition to the need for leaders at all levels to strengthen the education of subordinates on the overall concept and eliminate departmentalism, the important issue is how to strengthen the materials supply organs of various systems and regions, give them the necessary support and power, and stipulate the necessary disciplines and systems so that they can effectively play their due role in the balancing and allocation work. Now is the time to stop this unled "barter trade." The practice of commercial departments and some production enterprises exchanging commodities or their own products for materials also needs to be changed. Recently, the State Council stipulated that in the future, steel materials and their products of commercial departments will not be supplied to applicant units such as capital construction and large factories. This is effective in stopping many units from grabbing materials everywhere regardless of whether they need them or not and overcoming the chaotic market phenomenon. However, in order to effectively implement this, relevant departments still need to take further measures.

    “物物交换”利少弊多
    杨立
    1956年当某些原材料供应紧张的时候，许多企业为了克服困难，曾本着互相支援，互通有无的精神，相互间调剂了一些原材料。从而使许多库存物资充分发挥了作用。这对克服原材料供应不足、帮助各企业更好地完成生产和基本建设计划，曾起了良好的作用。但是，从目前的情况来看，“互通有无”已经发展到到处乱抓材料进行“物物交换”了；已经由工业和基本建设部门发展到商业部门；甚至逐渐形成一个“物物交换”的“自由市场”。随着就产生了许多流弊，造成了许多混乱现象。现在看来，这种做法已经是利少弊多了。
    “互通有无”的目的，原来是为着更好地利用原材料，消除此多彼少，余缺不均的现象，缓和材料供应的困难。但是，自从发展到“物物交换”以后，每个单位要想取得自己需要的材料，必须拿另一种材料去和别的单位交换。在这种情况下，那个单位的材料（尤其是国家最缺乏的材料）储备愈多，他和别人交换的“本钱”就愈大，材料供应问题也就更好解决。这就促使许多企业不管自己需要不需要，尽量多抓材料。于是有些单位就抽调大批人员到处采购，见到材料就抓。南京市第一工业局抽调了三十多名干部，借了许多资金，专门成立了一个“材料经理室”，在上海、北京等地还设立了“办事处”，不管是否需要，到处采购。并且增加“代办”材料的“保管费”，购买小汽车，请客吃饭，还打算兴建仓库。有人称之为“材料托拉斯”。就这样在没有组织领导的情况下进行自由交换。这个单位能够拿出去交换的材料，往往不是另一个单位所急需的。而有些单位有时为了换得一些自己需要的材料，不得不转几次手，交换几次，甚至还要到外地去交换，不必要的增加了材料的流转过程。为了便利“交换”，越是国家最缺乏的材料，越成为大家争购的对象，结果“愈缺愈争，愈争愈缺”，人为地制造了供应紧张的气氛。这不仅浪费了大量人力，造成了材料的迂回运输，增加了企业的成本，而且使得许多单位积存了很多自己不急需或者根本不需要的材料，反而使得材料供应更加紧张。
    “物物交换”开始时，还只在某些工业、建筑企业之间进行，以后流传的范围扩大，商业部门也参加了。不少商业单位在出售生产资料时，也要采购部门拿钢材、木材去交换，否则便不出卖。沈阳市某些商业部门竟发展到连出售白布、棉大衣也要企业拿生铁去交换了。发展到后来，某些生产原材料或机器的单位，也把自己生产的成品当成了交换的“本钱”。森林工业企业拿木材换钢材；钢铁企业拿生铁或钢材去交换机器设备。结果在一定程度上打乱了国家的计划供应，削弱了计划管理的作用。
    “物物交换”发展到最后，不但助长了本位主义思想的发展，在某些企业单位中甚至出现了冒名欺骗，抢购囤积，谋取暴利等行为，贪污盗窃也有了滋长。有的采购人员冒充当地企业骗购物资、假订“交换协议”骗取材料，有的采取请客送礼的手段拉“关系”。个别单位竟发展到抢购囤积，乘其他企业急需的机会，高价要挟。有的单位一个汽车喇叭竟要换二吨钢材；五公斤电线要换一吨电铜。这就使得某些企业之间，由原来的互相支援、互通有无的关系，一变而为互相要挟，互相欺骗。损人利己的思想作风，逐渐侵蚀了我们社会主义企业的某些工作人员，尤其值得注意的是：在“物物交换”的掩盖下，麻痹了我们对这些思想侵蚀的警惕。
    目前，国家生产的某些材料在数量、品种，规格还不能满足实际需要，供应计划和生产及基本建设计划不够衔接，这种情况暂时还很难完全克服。在材料分配上也还存在着一些缺点。在这种情况下，为了充分地挖掘库存物资的潜力，克服目前材料供应的困难，“互通有无”合理调剂的工作更是有必要的。但是，“互通有无”应当通过有组织、有领导的合理地平衡调剂来进行，而不能听其自流。
    有人认为，目前统一的平衡调剂工作有许多困难，“物物交换”虽然存在着许多弊病，但还没有更好的办法来代替。这种说法是值得研究的。过去几年来，各级物资供应部门，曾经组织进行了许多平衡调剂工作，取得了很大的成绩。1956年材料供应发生困难后，有些单位在“多备无患”的思想指导下，总想多储备一些材料，以备不时之需，不愿意把自己多余的材料调剂出去。这种情况确实给统一的平衡调剂工作带来了困难。但是，平衡调剂工作在后来所以愈难进行，更重要的原因还在于不少领导机关和物资供应部门不能很好掌握库存情况。家底不清，心中无数；加上“物物交换”的流行，助长了本位主义思想的发展，更给统一的平衡调剂工作造成了许多障碍。如果我们能够积极采取有效措施，这些困难并不是不能克服的。
    因此，我们认为有关部门需要迅速采取措施加强统一的平衡调剂工作，逐渐制止自流的“物物交换”的办法。首先要切实摸清各个单位的库存情况，进一步健全储备制度，分清合理的储备和过多过早不合理的储备。这是组织平衡调剂的重要前提。在平衡调剂工作中，除了各级领导上需要加强对下级进行整体观念的教育，消除本位主义思想，重要的问题是如何加强各系统和各地区的物资供应机关，给他们必要的支持和权力，规定必要的纪律和制度，使他们能够在平衡调剂工作中切实发挥应有的作用。现在已经是制止这种无领导的“物物交换”的时候了。商业部门和某些生产企业拿商品或者自己的产品去交换材料的做法，也需要加以改变。最近，国务院规定今后商业部门的钢铁材料及其制品，一律不供应基本建设和大工厂等申请单位。这对制止许多单位不管是否需要到处乱抓材料的做法，克服市场混乱现象是有效的。但要切实得到贯彻也还需要有关部门进一步采取措施。
