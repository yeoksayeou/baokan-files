Shijiazhuang Completes Planting Plan

(Our Newspaper News) The Shijiazhuang area of Hebei has successfully completed its plan to plant 650,000 new fruit trees this year. This figure is equivalent to 72% of the original number of fruit trees before liberation.

This year, the variety of fruit trees planted here has increased compared to previous years. There are more than 40 famous varieties such as Banana Apple, Milk Grape, Luren Walnut, Shenzhou Honey Peach, and Zhaoxian Snowflake Pear. It is expected that these fruit trees will gradually bear fruit in the next three to five years. By then, the Shijiazhuang area will become a "land of flowers and fruits." (Liang Zhaobin)

    石家庄完成栽植计划
    本报讯　河北石家庄地区今年新植果树六十五万棵的计划，已胜利完成。这个数字，相当于解放前原有果树的72％。
    今年，这里栽植的果树品种比往年增多了。像香蕉苹果、牛奶葡萄、露仁核桃、深州蜜桃、赵县雪花梨等著名品种，就有四十多个。预计在今后三、五年内，这些果树将陆续结果。到那时，石家庄地区就要变成“花果之乡”了。（梁兆斌）
