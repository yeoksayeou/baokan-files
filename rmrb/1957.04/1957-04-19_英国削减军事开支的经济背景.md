    The Economic Background of British Military Expenditure Cuts
    Yao Nianqing

    The recently published British government defense white paper stipulates a reduction in military spending. This signifies a shift in British military policy. This change, which has been brewing for some time, reflects the serious situation of the British economy, among other reasons.

    For quite a long time, some in Britain have repeatedly pointed out that the British economy is unable to bear the huge military expenditure planned by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Today, British government representatives also acknowledge that the heavy burden of military spending undermines the stability of the British economy.

    The various problems existing in the British economy have today reached such a critical point that the British government has to consider partially reducing military spending in order to free up some resources for more pressing areas. Among these problems, we can extract the following threads:

    The British ruling class is extremely eager to expand overseas investment, using the method of strengthening economic control to maintain the increasingly disintegrating imperial system. But they lack capital.

    Britain is a country with extensive international economic ties. The Commonwealth countries together have a population of more than 600 million and possess rich resources; the Sterling Area is even larger. In Britain's foreign trade, this vast region accounts for 50% of the proportion. In the world's foreign trade, half or more of the transactions are conducted in pounds sterling. Therefore, the "overseas empire" is something that British imperialism must maintain at all costs. But this is not a simple matter. As early as 1952, "The Economist" magazine pointed out: The other members of the Sterling Area depend on Britain because Britain provides them with a market for export goods and the capital needed for development. If the Sterling Area is to remain united, Britain must provide not only markets, but also capital. If it cannot do so, the members of the Sterling Area will turn to the United States to meet their capital needs. If the amount of capital flowing in from the United States is greater than the amount flowing in from London, then the Sterling Area will disintegrate.

    In recent years, the rising national independence movements in Asia and Africa have impacted the foundations of the "British Empire." British monopoly capital hopes to maintain the setting sun of the "overseas empire" by expanding overseas investment. However, it does not have the strength to provide sufficient capital to the Commonwealth countries.

    In 1913, the value of British capital exported overseas, if converted to today's value, totaled as much as 800 million pounds. However, in the initial four years after the Second World War, from 1946 to 1949, British capital exported to the overseas Sterling Area totaled less than 700 million pounds. In fact, this was mainly靠借得钱靠用奴役性的条件向美国贷得的钱（This was mainly through enslaving conditions on money borrowed from the United States）. Since then, US "aid" has gradually decreased. However, the funds deposited in London by Britain's colonies and other members of the Commonwealth (the so-called "sterling balances") have increased, with approximately 400 million pounds deposited in the three years from 1950 to 1952. This provided another important source of British capital. During this period, Britain exported nearly 500 million pounds of capital to various parts of the overseas Sterling Area. However, this accumulation of funds mainly occurred during the Korean War buying spree, because raw material prices in the Sterling Area rose sharply, exports were booming, and the colonies gained large export surpluses. With the collapse of the "Korean War boom," these "sterling balances" also decreased. From 1953 to 1955, they only amounted to 240 million pounds. During the same period, British investment in the overseas Sterling Area also fell to 376.6 million pounds.

    The problem is not only that these balances are becoming less and less. This deposit originally mainly came from British West Africa and Malaya; from 1950 to 1955, 47% of the funds deposited in London by the colonies came from British West Africa, and 40% came from Malaya. Now the Gold Coast in British West Africa has become independent, and Malaya is also about to become independent. They are both preparing to carry out their own economic construction. Thereafter, it will not only be difficult for Britain to continue to transfer their funds, but on the contrary, they will also demand to withdraw their past deposits.

    The United States is using the desire of various parts of the Commonwealth to develop industry, luring them with the supply of capital to squeeze out British influence with each step getting closer and closer; moreover, West German capital is also expanding investment in backward areas. This makes the problem even more acute.

    Faced with this situation, the British ruling class cannot but seek countermeasures. This is one of them.

    They are extremely eager to consolidate the tottering pound sterling market; however, gold and dollar reserves are often insufficient.

    The instability of the pound sterling is also a serious warning to the British ruling class. The expansion of the pound sterling's circulation internationally means substantial banking profits, and whether the pound sterling is stable is ultimately related to the survival of the Sterling Area. In 1955, Britain experienced its fourth balance of payments crisis since the war. Due to frequent crises, gold reserves have long remained at a low level, and the pound sterling has been very unstable. Last year, Britain conducted its invasion of Egypt. In just two months, November and December, gold and dollar reserves actually lost $3.55 billion (excluding special receipts and payments such as loans). The exchange rate of the pound sterling in the official market has long remained close to the official lower limit, that is, one pound sterling exchanged for $2.78, and the black market pound sterling has fallen even more. How to consolidate the international position of the pound sterling is a current urgent task for the British ruling class. In order to stabilize the pound sterling, Britain must improve its balance of payments situation and allocate a portion from the balance of payments surplus to replenish gold and dollar reserves.

    According to British official estimates, based solely on the overseas investments that Britain has already committed to and the prospect of various countries in the overseas Sterling Area withdrawing past deposits in London, plus the need to replenish reserves and repay the principal and interest on foreign debt, Britain must achieve a current account surplus of at least 300 to 500 million pounds annually in the future to cope with.

    Since the beginning of 1955, the British ruling class has carried out a series of so-called "anti-inflation" measures domestically. They raised the Bank of England's rediscount rate to the highest level since 1931, restricted domestic credit, vigorously compressed the consumption of durable consumer goods, abolished subsidies for milk, bread, and housing construction, restrained investment in state-owned enterprises, and changed the past method of providing direct subsidies for private industrial investment. They attempted to compress domestic needs, thereby suppressing imports, forcing materials to turn to exports, and creating a surplus in the balance of payments.

    These stopgap measures have achieved some temporary effects. Last year, the balance of payments managed to obtain a surplus of 233 million pounds—almost all of which was used for the export of long-term capital. However, there are still many problems. First, the surplus is not large enough; second, the pound sterling sell-off caused by the invasion of Egypt consumed a large amount of reserves; third, the increase in dollar oil expenditure and the decrease in the income of British oil companies in the Middle East will inevitably affect this year's balance of payments; and fourth, domestic industrial production has therefore stagnated for a long time.

    The results of the "anti-inflation" measures have indeed suppressed consumption, but the upward trend of domestic fixed capital investment centered on updating production equipment since 1953 has also ended this year. In the long run, it will inevitably endanger the foundation of the British economy. Therefore, another way out is needed. This is the second.

    They urgently need to expand export industries in order to strengthen competition; however, large-scale arms production weakens export capacity.

    Britain's fixed capital investment is already lagging behind some of its major competitors. According to materials published by the British Board of Trade, from 1950 to 1954, the net value of fixed capital investment in West Germany accounted for 14% of the gross national product, while Britain only accounted for 5.5%. In the two years of 1955 and 1956, the proportion of fixed capital investment in the two countries both increased, but did not change Britain's disadvantage.

    In the international market, Britain's export growth in recent years has not only lagged behind West Germany, but also lagged behind the United States, Japan, and several other Western European countries. In the total value of industrial manufactured goods exports in the capitalist world, Britain's share has fallen from 22% in 1951 to 19.7% in 1955, and further declined to 19% in 1956.

    Now, competition in the capitalist world market is entering a more intense stage. The factory equipment established by the large amount of domestic investment in major capitalist countries in the past few years has been put into production one after another. In addition, the market is limited, which has made export competition rapidly intensify. In order to cope with this competition, the British ruling class is extremely eager to restore measures to encourage industrial updating of equipment as soon as possible. However, the expansion of domestic investment, like the military burden, also requires imported materials and occupies products available for export. The 1955 balance of payments crisis proved that Britain was unable to bear the pressure from both sides at the same time. The situation requires a quick decision. This is the third.

    There is no other way out, so we have to plan from military spending; however, it is questionable how effective the current approach is.

    In order to expand overseas investment and replenish gold and dollar reserves, an export surplus must be obtained. In order to obtain an export surplus, import materials must be saved and exports must be expanded. In order to expand exports, industrial equipment must be updated. If you want to update equipment without hindering the achievement of a balance of payments surplus, you must save more import materials and export products in other areas. Military production accounts for 10% of Britain's gross national product, absorbs 7% of the labor force, consumes approximately 13% of the products of the metal manufacturing industry, requires a large amount of imported raw materials, weakens export capacity, and annually accounts for more than 150 million pounds in international expenditures for overseas military expenditures. In this way, since the British ruling class has no other way out, after cutting and reducing domestically and unable to find a way out, they finally have no choice but to plan from military spending.

    However, the new plan does not reduce military spending by a very large amount, and the British government has decided to devote more resources to the manufacture of nuclear weapons and prepare for atomic warfare; at the same time, the budget cuts at home only benefit the monopoly capitalists and the so-called middle class that the Conservative Party relies on in elections, and the broad masses of workers do not benefit much, so it is still a big question how many problems can be solved.

    英国削减军事开支的经济背景
    姚念庆
    英国政府新近发表的国防白皮书，规定要削减军费。这意味着英国军事政策上的一个变化。这个酝酿已久的变化，除了其他的原因以外，反映了英国经济的严重局面。
    相当长一个时期以来，英国就有人一再指出，英国经济无力承担北大西洋公约组织计划的巨大的军事开支。今天，英国政府代表也承认了军费的重担破坏了英国经济的稳定。
    英国经济中存在的各种问题今天已经达到这样尖锐的程度，以致英国政府不得不考虑部分缩减军费，以便腾出一些力量来用于更为迫切的方面。在这些问题中，我们可以抽出以下几条线索来：
    英国统治集团极欲扩大海外投资，用加强经济控制的办法来维持日益瓦解的帝国体系。但是他们缺乏资本。
    英国是一个具有广泛国际经济联系的国家。联邦各国合计有六亿以上人口，拥有丰富的资源；英镑区的范围更大。在英国的对外贸易中，这一广大的地区占有50％的比重。在全世界的对外贸易中，有一半或更多的交易是用英镑来进行的。因此，“海外帝国”是英帝国主义要尽一切可能来加以保持的。但是这事并非简单，早在1952年，“经济学家”周刊就曾经指出：英镑区其它成员之依附于英国，是因为英国为它们提供了出口货物的市场和发展所需要的资本。要想英镑区继续团结在一起，英国只提供市场是不够的。它必须也提供资本。如果它不能这样做，英镑区的成员将转向美国以求满足它们的资本需要。如果美国资本流入的数量比伦敦流入的数量多的话，那么英镑区便将瓦解。
    近年来，亚非地区高涨的民族独立运动冲击着“大英帝国”的根基。英国垄断资本希望能用扩大海外投资的方法来维持夕阳西斜的“海外帝国”。但是，它却没有力量向联邦国家提供充足的资本。
    在1913年，英国向海外输出的资本若是合成今日的价值，共达八亿镑之多。但是，在第二次大战后初期1946年到1949年的四年中，英国向海外英镑区输出的资本却一共不到七亿镑。事实上，这主要还是靠用奴役性的条件向美国贷得的钱。此后，美“援”逐渐减少。但是英国殖民地和联邦的其他成员向伦敦存入的资金（即所谓“英镑结存”）却有增长，1950年到1952年的三年中存入了约四亿镑，这提供了英国资本的另一重要来源。此期中英国向海外英镑区各地输出了近五亿镑的资本。但是，这些资金的积累主要是在朝鲜战争抢购时期中，因为英镑区原料价格高涨，出口旺盛，各殖民地获得了大量的出口顺差。随着“朝战景气”的破灭，这种“英镑结存”也减少了。1953年到1955年中只有二亿四千万镑。同时期英国投入海外英镑区的资本也下降至三亿七千六百万镑。
    问题不仅是这种结存愈来愈少。这项存款原来主要来自英属西非和马来亚两地；由1950年到1955年的六年中，殖民地存入伦敦的资金47％来自英属西非，40％来自马来亚。现在英属西非中的黄金海岸已经独立，马来亚也即将独立。它们都准备进行自己的经济建设。此后，不但英国难以继续移用它们的资金，相反地，它们还会要求提取它们过去的存款。
    美国利用英联邦各地发展工业的愿望，以供应资本为饵来排挤英国势力的活动一步紧似一步；而且，西德资本也在向落后地区扩大投资。这就使问题益加尖锐了。
    面对着这样的情势，英国统治集团不能不寻找对策。此其一。
    他们极欲巩固风雨飘摇的英镑市场；但是黄金美元贮备经常不足。
    英镑的不稳定也是对英国统治集团的一个严重警告。英镑在国际间流通范围的扩大意味着丰厚的银行利润，而且英镑是否稳定最终关系到英镑区的存亡问题。1955年英国发生了战后第四次的国际收支危机。由于危机频仍，黄金贮备长期停留在低落的水平上，英镑十分不稳。去年英国进行侵埃冒险，只在11月和12月短短的两个月内，黄金美元贮备实际上丧失三十五亿五千万美元（除掉借贷等特殊性的收支）。官方市场中的英镑汇价长期停留在接近官定下限，即一英镑换二元七角八分美元的地方，黑市英镑则下落更多。如何巩固英镑的国际地位是英国统治集团的当前急务。而要想稳定英镑，英国必须改善国际收支状况，从国际收支的盈余中拨出一部分来补充黄金美元贮备。
    根据英国官方人士的估计，仅就英国已经承诺了的海外投资和此后海外英镑区各国支取过去在伦敦存款的前景，加上补充贮备的需要和偿还外债本息等等，今后英国每年经常性的国际收支上至少要取得三亿到五亿镑的盈余才能应付。
    1955年年初以来英国统治集团在国内进行一系列的所谓“反膨胀”措施。他们把英格兰银行的再贴现率提高到1931年以来的最高水平，限制国内信贷，大力压缩耐久性消费品的消费，取消牛奶、面包和住宅建造的津贴，节制国营事业投资，并且改变了过去对私人工业投资给予直接津贴的办法。他们企图借此压缩国内需要，从而压制进口，迫使物资转向出口，造成国际收支上的盈余。
    这些饮鸩止渴的办法取得了一些临时的效果。去年国际收支上弄到了二亿三千三百万镑的盈余——几乎全部用于长期资本的输出。但是问题仍然很多。一则盈余为数不够多，二则侵埃战争引起的英镑抛售消耗了大量贮备，三则美元石油支出增长而中东英国石油公司收入下降，势必影响今年的国际收支，四则国内工业生产因而长期停滞。
    “反膨胀”措施的结果固然压制了消费，但是1953年来以更新生产设备为中心的国内固定资本投资的上升趋势也在今年终止了。长此以往，必然危及英国经济的根本。因此还需另求出路。此其二。
    他们急需扩大出口工业，以便加强竞争；但是大规模军备生产削弱出口能力。
    英国的固定资本投资本来就落后于它的一些主要竞争者的。根据英国贸易部发表的材料由1950年到1954年西德固定资本投资净值占国民生产毛值14％，英国只有5.5％。1955年和1956年两年，两国固定资本投资的比例都有提高，但是没有改变英国的劣势。
    在国际市场中，英国近年来的出口增长不但落后于西德，也落后于美国、日本和好几个西欧国家。在资本主义世界工业制成品出口总值中，英国所占的份额由1951年的22％降至1955年的19.7％，1956年又下降到19％。
    现在，资本主义世界市场的竞争正在进入一个更加剧烈的阶段。过去几年中各主要资本主义国家国内大量投资所建立的厂房设备陆续投入生产，加以市场有限，这就使出口竞争迅速地剧烈起来。为了应付这种竞争，英国统治阶级极盼早日恢复鼓励工业更新设备的措施。但是国内投资的扩大和军事负担一样，也要求进口物资并占用可供出口的产品。1955年的国际收支危机证明英国无力同时承担两方面的压力。形势要求迅速作出抉择。此其三。
    没有其他出路，只好从军费上打算盘；但是目前的做法效果如何还是疑问。
    为了扩大海外投资和补充黄金美元贮备，必须取得出口盈余。为了取得出口盈余，必须节省进口物资和扩大出口。为了扩大出口，必须更新工业设备。要想更新设备而不妨碍国际收支盈余的取得，又必须更多地在别的方面省出进口物资和出口产品来。军事生产占英国国民总产值的10％，吸住了劳动人口的7％，消耗金属制造业的产品的大约13％，既需要大量进口原料又削弱出口能力，而且每年在国际支出上占一亿五千万镑以上用作海外军事开支的项目。这样，英国统治集团既无其他出路，在国内左削右减而不得之后，终于不能不从军事开支上打算盘。
    但是，新计划削减军费数目还不很大，而且英国政府决定以更多力量从事核武器制造，准备原子战争；同时预算的削减在国内只有利于垄断资本家和保守党在选举中要依凭的所谓中产阶级，广大工人群众并无什么得益，因此能够解决多少问题还是一个大疑问。
