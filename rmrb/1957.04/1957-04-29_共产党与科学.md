The Communist Party and Science
Fan Kang

Reviewing the past helps us understand the present. At the very least, thinking about old events can help in considering new problems.

When the Chinese Communist Party was first founded, it declared itself to be the party of the proletariat. Many people took this literally: the proletariat is the poor class; therefore, they assumed that this party naturally had the ability to stir up strikes, demonstrations... and other disturbances, but beyond that, it would certainly not be able to achieve anything. But later, the Communist Party started fighting, first in the mountains and valleys as guerrillas, carving out a situation, "But—people said again—the Communist Party will never be able to fight a regular war." Later, the Communist Party also fought regular wars, and defeated Chiang Kai-shek, and marched into the big cities. So, people said again: "It seems that the Communist Party is good at fighting wars, but it certainly doesn't have the political ability to rule the country." But again, unexpectedly, the Communist Party ruled the country in an orderly manner. "Then—people said again—the final stumbling block will probably be economic problems. How can the Communist Party have a way to manage the economy?" After the implementation of the first Five-Year Plan, people saw that the Communist Party still had ways to manage the economy. So people thought again: leading science, the Communist Party is ultimately not capable of, because this requires a special kind of mind.

In the more than thirty years of the Chinese Communist Party's history, it has undergone rigorous tests time and time again, military, political, economic,... and finally passed them all. Now, it is being tested again on the issue of leading science, which may be the last time. The answers regarding the humanities are still acceptable, but the problem now lies in the natural sciences.

Based on the results of past exams, I think the Communist Party will also pass the exam on leading the natural sciences. This is not only the result of formal logical deduction, but also has some concrete basis. First, the Communist Party's dialectical materialist epistemology does not recognize that there are unknowable things in the world, so it dares to touch anything it needs to know; and recognizing nature and conquering nature is one of the Communist Party's firm goals. Second, the Communist Party is best at "learning, learning, and learning again." Third, the Communist Party is not afraid of difficulties; natural science is indeed difficult, but it is not so difficult as to be fatal; the Communist Party is not afraid of even deadly wars, and has learned them, so what about natural science. Also, "consistency of thought should always help still incomplete knowledge to move forward" (Engels). The Communist Party is recognized as surpassing any class party in terms of consistency and thoroughness of thought, so this can also help it to master natural science.

The above is about possibility, we should also say that the Communist Party is now effectively leading natural science. The creation of a social system that has opened up broad avenues for the development of natural science, the determination of the direction for natural science to serve the people, the comprehensive and long-term planning for the development of natural science, the full guarantee of research conditions for natural science, the unity and transformation of natural scientists across the country, the growth of natural scientists within the Party and the League, the proposal of the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, the response to the call to march towards science... is this not leadership? Has history ever had a precedent for such leadership of natural science?

However, saying that the Communist Party can lead natural science does not mean that every Communist Party member can lead natural science research institutions. It should be admitted that many Communist Party members currently working in leading positions in scientific research institutions still lack the ability to lead this institution, because they have too little knowledge of the science studied by the institution they are in, and have no say. However, since they are Communist Party members and bear the tasks given by the Party, they must know how to lead even if they don't. And to know how to lead, the first thing to do is to learn from the scientists being led, at least about science, so that they can speak the same language as the scientists. Otherwise, if you only talk about Marxism and they only talk about natural science, it is like two foreigners who do not speak the same language being together, and it is difficult to make friends in the first place, let alone talk about leadership.

A few years ago, a friend of mine, who was a Party member, worked in a leadership position at a university. He originally knew nothing about natural science, but he spent more than a year asking several biology professors for advice and learning some basic knowledge. Once, a meeting of two or three hundred biologists and agronomists required him to talk about "natural dialectics." Unable to refuse, he went and spoke for four hours, connecting it to many biological issues. After the speech, an old professor asked him in surprise: "How do you know so much about biology?" He replied with a flushed face: "My biology knowledge is only enough for these four hours. If I talk for another ten minutes, I will be exposed. So I am Cheng Yaojin, and only know three axe blows." But the old professor said enthusiastically: "It's good to have these three axe blows. This way you can talk to us, and over time, you will have more biology knowledge."

My friend also told me: The most important thing for Communists to learn science is not to be afraid of losing face. We Communists are not discouraged by fighting several defeats in war, nor do we feel ashamed in front of the enemy; in production, we are not discouraged by making some mistakes, nor do we feel ashamed in front of nature. Only when we say a few unprofessional words on scientific issues and are ridiculed by experts, do we feel embarrassed and discouraged, but this is actually unnecessary.

    共产党与科学

    温故而知新。至少，想想旧事，对新问题的考虑是有帮助的。
    中国共产党一出世的时候，就声称自己是无产阶级的政党。许多人顾名思义：无产阶级就是贫穷的阶级；所以，他们以为，这个党闹闹罢工、示威……等等乱子的本领，自然是有的，但此外，就一定不能有所作为。但后来，共产党打起仗来了，先是在山沟里打游击，打出一个局面来，“但是——人们又说——打正规战，共产党总是不行的。”后来共产党也打起正规战来了，而且打败了蒋介石，打进了大城市。于是，人们又说：“看来，共产党打仗是全行，可是，统治全国的政治本领，究竟是没有的，”可是，又出乎意外，共产党竟把全国统治得秩序井然了。“那么——人们又说——最后的碰壁，恐怕是在经济问题上了，共产党搞经济，怎么会有办法呢？”经过第一个五年计划的执行，人们看出，在经济上，共产党还是有办法。于是人们又以为：领导科学，共产党到底是不行的了，因为这是需要有特种的头脑的。
    中国共产党的三十多年的历史中，就是这样一次一次地受了严格的考试，军事、政治、经济，……总算都通过了。现在，在领导科学的问题上，又受着考试，这也许是最后一次了。关于人文科学的答案，还可以过得去，现在的问题在于自然科学上面。
    根据过去几次考试的结果推论起来，我看共产党也会在领导自然科学的问题的考试上及格的。这不仅是形式逻辑推论的结果，还有一些具体的根据。第一，共产党的辩证唯物主义的认识论，不承认世界上有不可知的事物，所以，就敢于对自己所需要知道的任何事物碰一碰；而认识自然，征服自然，又是共产党的坚定目的之一。二则，共产党最善于“学习、学习、再学习”。三则，共产党最不怕困难；自然科学诚然是难的，但还不至于难得要命；共产党连要命的战争都不怕，也学会了，那么，何况自然科学。还有，“思想的首尾一贯性在任何时候都应当帮助还不充分的知识继续前进”（恩格斯）。共产党，在思想的一贯性、彻底性方面，被公认为胜过任何阶级党派的，那么，这也能帮助它去掌握自然科学。
    以上说的是可能性，我们还应当说，共产党现在实际上已经有效地领导着自然科学。为自然科学的发展开辟了广阔道路的社会制度的创造，使自然科学为人民服务的方向的规定，对自然科学发展的全面而长期的规划，对自然科学的研究条件的充分保证，对全国自然科学家的团结和改造，党内和团内的自然科学者的增长，百家争鸣的政策的提出，向科学进军的号召的得到响应……这一切，不是领导么？这样的对自然科学的领导，历史有过先例么？
    然而，说共产党能够领导自然科学，并不等于每个共产党员能够领导自然科学研究机关。应该承认：现在的在许多科学研究机关里做领导工作的共产党员个人，是还缺乏领导这个机关的能力的，因为对他所在的机关所研究的那门科学的知识还太少，没有发言权。但是，既然是共产党员，负有党所给的任务，那么，不会领导也得会。而要会领导，首先就要向被领导的科学家学习，至少关于科学，也能同科学家讲几句共同语言。否则，你只讲马克思主义，他只讲自然科学，好像语言不通的两个外国人在一起，首先就交不上朋友，更难谈到领导了。
    前几年，我的一个朋友，是党员，在大学里做领导工作。他对自然科学，本来是一窍不通的，但他花了一年多工夫，向几位生物学教授请教，学得了一些基本知识。有一次，一个集合了两三百生物学家和农学家的会议，一定要他去讲讲“自然辩证法”，没法推托，他就去了，讲了四个钟头，联系了好些生物学上的问题。讲完以后，一位老教授诧异地问他：“你怎么对生物学懂得不少？”他满面通红地答道：“我的生物学知识，只够这四个钟头之用，倘若再讲上十分钟，就要露马脚了。所以我是程咬金，只会三斧头”。但那老教授热情地说：“有这三斧头就好，这样你就可以同我们谈得来，谈久了，你的生物学知识会更多的”。
    我的朋友还告诉我：共产党人学科学，最要紧的是不要怕丢脸。我们共产党人，在战争中，打几次败仗，并不灰心，也不对敌人觉得脸红；在生产中，出些差错，也不灰心，也不对自然觉得脸红，独有在科学问题上，说了几句外行话，被内行所哂笑时，却不免满面含羞，灰心丧气，但这，其实是不必要的。
