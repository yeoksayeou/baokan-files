Why Not Dismount? Who Can Make Them Dismount?

Right when the Second Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee was calling for increased production and frugality, the construction of the administrative office building of the Central Meteorological Bureau had just begun. Logically, in the interest of increasing production and practicing frugality, this project should be halted immediately to avoid further waste. However, neither the bureau nor the Beijing Municipal Real Estate Management Bureau, which is undertaking the construction, have any intention of reining in the horse; instead, they are spurring it on, attempting to create a fait accompli.

I believe that there is no need to build this administrative office building at all right now. In the past, the Meteorological Bureau could accommodate and work in its current location when the number of people was as high as 400. Why is it that now, with only 200 people, it is no longer sufficient? Moreover, senior cadres' dormitories have been added in the western suburbs, the site of the former Beijing Meteorological School has also been handed over to the Meteorological Bureau, and a warehouse was built outside Guang'anmen last year. The conditions are better than before. I went to the Soviet Union for observation and found that the area and environment of our Meteorological Bureau are larger and better than those in the Soviet Union. Therefore, there is no reason to say that our current site is unsuitable as a high-altitude site and must be moved.

Of course, if the decision had been made not to build earlier, it would not have caused waste. But stopping construction now is not too late and can avoid more waste. So far, less than one-tenth of the construction has been completed, with a total expenditure of more than 86,000 yuan. The prefabricated parts and the basement can be fully utilized, and the actual waste is only about 10,000 yuan for the brickwork. If construction continues, it will cost another 700,000 to 800,000 yuan, and the government will have to be asked to allocate 150 to 200 mu of fertile land. Moreover, moving the site would squeeze out the high-altitude station, which would make the meteorological scientific research institutions too dispersed, inconvenient for the expansion of organizations, and inconvenient for internships and leadership. Isn't it obvious which is more cost-effective, stopping work or continuing construction? Unfortunately, the Meteorological Bureau and the Real Estate Management Bureau have consistently refused to accept opinions, insisting that the construction is already "scaled" and that "stopping work is a waste," advocating continuing construction.

In order to avoid this waste, I have successively reported opinions or requested assistance in solving this problem to the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, the Party Committee Directly Under the State Organs, the Seventh Office of the State Council, and the Bureau of Letters and Visits of the Ministry of Supervision over nearly two years. The time is not short, and the number of agencies visited is not small, but the problem has not been resolved. They do not go to the site for inspection, but only listen to the opinions of the Meteorological Bureau and the Real Estate Management Bureau one-sidedly, and also advocate construction, accommodating the fait accompli. Currently, this project is actively preparing to resume work. I don't understand: why don't they dismount? Who can make them dismount?

### 为什么不下马？谁能使之下马？

    为什么不下马？谁能使之下马？
    就在党的二中全会号召增产节约的时候，中央气象局兴建的行政办公大楼刚刚动工。按说，为了增产节约，这个工程应当立即停工，避免更多的浪费。但是，这个局和承建这一工程的北京市房产管理局都无勒马之意，反而打马加鞭突击施工，企图造成既成事实。
    我认为，目前根本不需要修建这座行政办公大楼。现在的气象局，在过去人数多到四百多人的时候，都能住下办公，为什么现在只有两百多人了，反而不行了呢？何况现在还在西郊增加了高级干部宿舍，原北京气象专科学校的校址也移交给了气象局，去年又在广安门外修建了仓库，条件比过去更好了。我曾去苏联考察，发现：我们气象局的场地面积、环境，比苏联的要大、要好。因而，根本没有理由说我们现在的场地不适合作高空场地，必须迁出。
    当然，早决定不建，就不会造成浪费；但是现在停建，还为时不晚，可以避免更多的浪费。到目前为止，施工部分不及十分之一，共开支八万六千多元，其中预制品和地下室完全可以利用，真正浪费的也不过是砌墙部分约有万元上下而已。要是继续开工，还得开支七、八十万元，还得向政府申请拨给一百五十到两百亩良田。而且，要迁地址，得把高空台挤出，就会使气象科学研究机构过于分散，对组织机构的扩大，对实习与领导都不方便。停工与继续开工，哪一样合算，难道还不明显吗？可惜得很，气象局和房产管理局一直不接受意见，硬说施工已具“规模”，“停工就是浪费”，主张继续施工。
    为了避免这笔浪费，我在将近两年的时间中，曾先后向中共北京市委员会、北京市人民委员会、国家机关直属党委、国务院第七办公室、中央监察部控诉局等单位，或反映意见，或请求协助解决这个问题。时间不算短，跑的机关不算少，然而问题却都没有结果。他们都不到现场检查，只片面地听取气象局和房产管理局的意见，也主张施工，迁就既成事实。目前这一工程，又在积极准备复工了。我不明白：究竟他们为什么不下马？谁才能使之下马？
