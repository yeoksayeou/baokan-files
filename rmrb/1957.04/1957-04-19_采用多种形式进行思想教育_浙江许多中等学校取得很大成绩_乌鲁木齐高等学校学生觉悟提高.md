    Many Secondary Schools in Zhejiang Achieve Great Results
    Students' Awareness Improves in Urumqi Universities

    (Our Newspaper) Hangzhou News - Zhejiang Province's 410 secondary schools have actively strengthened the ideological and political education of students, and have achieved significant results.

    This semester, secondary schools in Zhejiang Province have conducted political and ideological education for students in four aspects: first, educating students to view the international and domestic situation from the standpoint, viewpoint, and method of the working class; second, strengthening revolutionary tradition education; third, strengthening labor education; fourth, strengthening communist moral character education and collectivist spirit education. The methods adopted by each school are: first, combining political and ideological education in literature, history, geography and other classroom teaching. Second, adding one extra lesson of current affairs and policy per week for all classes above the third grade of junior high school. Third, closely connecting schools with social life, using holidays to organize students to visit agricultural production cooperatives, factories, and visit industrial and agricultural production exhibitions, or using weekends to invite agricultural cooperative members, model laborers, and combat heroes to give speeches at schools. Fourth, carrying out extracurricular research groups and self-study groups activities, organizing students to read newspapers, discuss current affairs, read and discuss excellent literary works, and organize students to watch educational films. Fifth, giving full play to the organizational role of class teachers and the Young Communist League and Young Pioneers in the class. Sixth, many schools held parent meetings and used methods such as conducting home visits to mobilize parents to cooperate with schools in conducting political and ideological education.

    (Our Newspaper) Urumqi News - Urumqi's higher education institutions are universally conducting revolutionary tradition education for students of all ethnic groups, and the socialist consciousness of students is constantly improving.

    Since the beginning of this semester, in order to correct the phenomena of hedonism, fear of hardship, and disunity among some students, various colleges have specially invited veteran revolutionaries to make reports and tell stories, and held current affairs forums to educate students on inheriting and carrying forward revolutionary traditions and promote a style of hard work and simplicity. Xinjiang College has successively invited Xiong Kuang, deputy director of the Political Department of the Xinjiang Military Region, and Hou Zhen, director of the Political Department of the August 1st Agricultural College, to give reports to students on the 25,000-li Long March and the Great Production Movement in Nanniwan, respectively. Xinjiang Medical College, August 1st Agricultural College, and Xinjiang Language College have also given special reports in light of the current ideological situation of students.

    After reports, forums, and discussions, many students examined their non-proletarian thoughts. During a forum at Xinjiang College, many students exposed their past bad habits such as not cherishing public property. Some classes, based on the content of the forum and combined with the specific situation of the class, formulated learning and frugality covenants. A trend of diligence, thrift, and simplicity began to emerge throughout the school.

    浙江许多中等学校取得很大成绩
    乌鲁木齐高等学校学生觉悟提高
    本报讯　浙江省四百一十所中等学校积极加强了学生的思想政治教育，目前取得了显著效果。
    浙江省中等学校本学期从四方面对学生进行了政治思想教育：一、教育学生用工人阶级的立场、观点和思想方法来看国际国内的形势；二、加强革命传统教育；三、加强劳动教育；四、加强共产主义道德品质教育和集体主义精神教育。各校采取的方法是：一、在文学、历史、地理等课堂教学中结合政治思想教育。二、初中三年级以上各班级每周增设一节时事政策课。三、密切学校同社会生活的联系，利用假日组织学生去农业生产合作社、工厂访问，参观工、农业生产展览会等活动，或者利用周末请农业社员、劳动模范、战斗英雄等人物去学校演讲。四、开展了课外研究小组和自学小组的活动，组织学生读报、讨论时事、阅读和讨论优秀的文艺作品，以及组织学生去看有教育意义的影片。五、发挥了班主任和班上的青年团、少先队的组织作用。六、许多学校召开家长会议，用进行家庭访问等办法动员学生家长配合学校进行政治思想教育。
    又讯　乌鲁木齐各高等学院普遍地对各族学生进行革命传统的教育，学生中的社会主义觉悟正在不断提高。
    从本学期开学以来，各学院为了纠正一部分学生中的贪图享乐、怕艰苦和不团结等现象，特邀请革命老前辈作报告、讲故事，召开时事座谈会，来向学生进行继承和发扬革命传统的教育，提倡艰苦朴素的作风。新疆学院先后邀请了新疆军区政治部副主任熊晃和八一农学院政治部主任侯真向学生分别作了两万五千里长征的经过和南泥湾大生产的报告。新疆医学院、八一农学院和新疆语文学院，也都结合着当前学生的思想情况作了专题报告。
    经过报告、座谈和讨论，不少学生检查了自己的非无产阶级的思想。新疆学院的学生在座谈时，许多同学揭发了过去不爱护公共财物等不良习惯。有些班级根据座谈的内容再结合着本班级的具体情况，订出了学习和节约公约。全校开始出现了勤俭朴素的风气。
