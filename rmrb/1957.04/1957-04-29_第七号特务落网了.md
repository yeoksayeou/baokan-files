Agent No. 7 is Arrested
　　Yi Jiaxiang
    I opened the case file of the dispatched agent, Wang Kejing.

    This complex case file narrates Wang Kejing's journey to Taipei, Hong Kong, his arrival at his residence in Beijing, and finally his arrest on a train departing from Beijing...

    Looking at the case file, the faces of the special agents appeared one by one before my eyes, scheming to undermine us...

    Here is a special agent organization in the suburbs of Taipei - the Chiang gang's "Ministry of National Defense Second Department's" "Field Personnel Training Class." From the winter of 1952 to the spring of 1953, Wang Kejing received specialized training in espionage here.

    What a strange place this is! In a room that resembles a classroom, a school-level instructor is holding a pistol and teaching shooting skills. But all those sitting below taking the class cannot see each other's faces. It turns out that they are all wearing American "Ku Klux Klan" style masks and robes, only exposing their eyes. When the instructor calls the "students," they are never called by name but by number. When No. 7 is called, Wang Kejing, whose face is covered, stands up.

    These "students" are spies and secret agents preparing to sneak into mainland China to engage in counter-revolutionary activities. These special agent "students" receive special agent training under the most secret conditions. Each "student" is accompanied by an assistant instructor. They live in the same room, eat and sleep together, and are even followed closely during walks. Except for half an hour of walking after dinner each day, the "students'" entire activities are restricted to their own bedrooms and study rooms, and they are not allowed to leave their rooms without authorization. Meals are delivered on time, and laundry is picked up on time. Special agent "students" cannot meet or talk to each other, let alone know each other's names. They must wear masks and robes when going to the toilet or taking a walk. When "students" attend classes, more than 90% of the courses are taken in their own rooms through a public address system.

    In 1954, Wang Kejing received training in Taipei again, this time for a longer period, lasting more than 8 months. Even during his "standby" period in Hong Kong, waiting to sneak into the mainland, the special agent organization constantly supervised him to review various espionage skills every day.

    It seems that the special agent organization was finally confident in Wang Kejing's special agent work ability.

    How did Wang Kejing get to Taipei? What is his background?

    Before the liberation of the mainland, Wang Kejing was originally a captain in the Kuomintang army. In 1948, after being liberated by the Chinese People's Liberation Army in Tieling, Northeast China, he did not abandon his reactionary stance. In October 1950, when the flames of the American war of aggression against Korea spread to the Yalu River, his hopes for the restoration of the reactionary rule of the US-Chiang clique were boosted. He fled from the mainland to Hong Kong to seek refuge with the Chiang gang. Soon, he joined the "Ministry of National Defense Second Department" organization in Hong Kong and became a special agent.

    The Chiang gang's special agent organization had high hopes for Wang Kejing.

    That was in the summer of 1953. After Wang Kejing graduated from his first training session in Taipei, he was ordered to go to Hong Kong to prepare to sneak into the mainland. The day before his departure, Lai Ming-tang, the "Director" of the "Ministry of National Defense Second Department," invited Wang Kejing to talk. He hosted a banquet to entertain him. During the banquet, Lai Ming-tang and seven or eight special agent bosses toasted him one by one, wishing him "all the best" and "smooth work."

    In October 1956, after Wang Kejing graduated from his second training session, the special agent organization hosted a second farewell banquet for him. They issued him a large amount of special agent funds. Before Wang Kejing sneaked into the mainland in January of this year, he had received more than 20,000 Hong Kong dollars from the special agent organization in four years. After entering the mainland, according to regulations, the monthly salary of this captain-ranked special agent was 900 Hong Kong dollars. According to Lai Ming-tang, this was even more than the salary of Chiang Kai-shek's major general.

    During Wang Kejing's standby period in Hong Kong, the special agent organization repeatedly remitted money in Wang Kejing's name to his old friends on the mainland in order to prepare a "survival base" for Wang Kejing after he sneaked into the mainland.

    It seems that the Chiang gang's special agent organization put a lot of effort and spent a lot of money on this special agent. However, Wang Kejing was arrested on a train departing from Beijing less than three months after sneaking into the mainland. Public security personnel found secret writing tools in the compartment of his beautiful suitcase specially made by the Taiwan special agent organization.

    When the dispatched agent Wang Kejing was hiding in Beijing, he began his special agent activities. For this purpose, he gave valuable gold pens, watches, and clothes he brought back to the country to people. He lavishly entertained people with food, drink, and entertainment.

    Among the people who came into contact with Wang Kejing, some liked his generous demeanor and extraordinary bearing, some accepted the gifts he gave and thought he was "enthusiastic" and "good to people," and did not doubt him at all. Some people even introduced him to lovers, and some were preparing to fall in love with him.

    However, he revealed his flaws in further activities, and under the surveillance of the masses and the public security organs, he was finally exposed.

    第七号特务落网了
　　易家祥
    我打开了派遣特务王克兢的案卷。
    这份错综复杂的案卷材料叙述着王克兢到了台北，到了香港，又到了在北京的住所，最后到了他被捕落网的从北京开出的一列火车上……。
    看着案卷，特务们的脸谱一个一个地浮现在我的眼前，他们在那里费尽心机地暗算我们……。
    这里是台北市郊的一个特务机关——蒋帮“国防部第二厅”的“外勤人员训练班”。1952年冬至1953年春，王克兢就是在这里受特务工作的专门训练的。
    这真是多么奇怪的地方啊！在一间像是教室的屋子里，一个校级教官手里拿着一枝手枪，他在讲射击术。可是那些坐在下边听课的人们全都看不见脸。原来他们一个个都穿戴着美国“三K党”式的面罩和罩袍，只露出两只眼睛。教官叫“学员”的时候一律不叫名字而叫第几号。当叫第七号的时候，蒙着脸的王克兢站起来了。
    这些“学员”们就是准备潜入中国大陆上搞反革命活动的特务间谍。这些特务“学员”们是在最秘密的状况下接受特务训练的。每一个“学员”都有一个助教伴随着。住在一间房间里，寝食与共，甚至散步时都是寸步不离地跟着。“学员”们除了每天晚餐后半小时的散步以外，整天的活动都被限制在他自己的寝室和学习室里，不得擅自出房门一步。饮食有人按时送去，要洗的衣物有人按时去取。特务“学员”们互相间不能见面、交谈，更不知道彼此的姓名。上厕所、散步一律要戴面罩，穿罩袍。“学员”上课时，十分之九以上的课程都是在自己的住室里通过报话器听课。
    1954年，王克兢曾经又一次在台北受训，这一次受训时间比第一次更长了，达8个多月之久。就是当他在香港“待命”潜入大陆的期间，特务机关也一直监督着他每天复习各项特务功课。
    看来，特务机关对王克兢的特务工作能力最后是放了心的。
    王克兢是怎样到台北的？他的来历如何？
    在大陆解放以前，王克兢原是国民党的上尉军官。1948年被中国人民解放军在东北铁岭解放后，他并没有放弃反动立场。1950年10月，当美国侵略朝鲜的战火延烧到鸭绿江畔的时候，他寄托在美蒋反动统治复辟的希望受到了鼓舞。他从大陆上逃到了香港投靠蒋帮。不久，他在香港参加了“国防部第二厅”的组织，当了特务。
    蒋帮特务机关对王克兢是寄予很大希望的。
    那是1953年夏，王克兢在台北第一次受训结业后，奉命到香港准备潜入大陆，临行的前一天，“国防部第二厅”的“厅长”赖名汤把王克兢请了去谈话。并设宴款待一番，席间赖名汤和七八个特务头子一一向他敬酒，祝他“诸事如意”、“工作顺利”。
    1956年10月，王克兢第二次受训结业后，特务机关又为他第二次饯行。发给了他大量特务经费。王克兢在今年1月潜入大陆以前，四年间他已从特务机关手里领取到两万多元港币。而在进入大陆之后，按照规定，这个上尉军衔的特务的月薪是港币九百元。据赖名汤对王克兢说，这已经比蒋介石的少将军官的薪金还要多。
    当王克兢在香港待命的期间，特务机关还曾经屡次以王克兢的名义，汇款给大陆上的他的旧友，为的是给王克兢准备潜入大陆后的“生存基础”。
    看来，蒋帮特务机关对这个特务是费了不少心计，花了不少本钱的。可是，王克兢潜入大陆后还不到三个月，却在从北京开出的一列火车上被捕了。从他那由台湾特务机关特制的漂亮的手提箱的夹层里，公安人员检查出了密写通讯用具。
    当派遣特务王克兢在北京隐藏的期间，他开始了他的特务活动。为了这个目的，他把带回国来的名贵金笔、手表和衣物送给人们。他阔绰地招待人们吃喝玩乐。
    在和王克兢接触的人们当中，有些人喜欢他举止大方、气度非凡的外表，有的人接受了他赠予的礼物，觉得他“热诚”，“对人好”，对他毫不置疑。有的人甚至为他介绍爱人，也有人就准备和他谈恋爱。
    然而，他在进一步的活动中露出了马脚，在群众和公安机关的监视下，终于被揭发了。
