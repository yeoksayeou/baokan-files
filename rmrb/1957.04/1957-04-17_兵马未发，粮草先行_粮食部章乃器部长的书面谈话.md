“Troops and horses move only after provisions and fodder are secured.” We in the grain department are taking on the task of "pioneering" for industrial and transportation construction and agricultural reclamation with this spirit. Conquering the Yellow River is an extremely great undertaking in Chinese history, and the Sanmenxia key project is the first unprecedentedly large-scale construction in the work of conquering the Yellow River. Of course, our grain department will attach great importance to this project, undertake the glorious task of "pioneering" with incomparably joyful mood, and is determined to do a good job in grain supply. We have already established a grain bureau in Sanmenxia.
	We know that the staff participating in this project, in addition to a large number of local laborers, also include many engineering and technical personnel from all over the country, and also experts sent by our great ally, the Soviet Union; therefore, the supply work is very complex. We must fully understand their different consumption habits; organize different grain varieties and different grades as much as possible, and appropriately meet their requirements. However, due to the serious natural disasters last year, we have encountered some difficulties in the allocation of grain varieties; at the same time, the allocation of grain varieties sometimes violates the route of rational transportation and wastes the country's transportation capacity; therefore, it is also difficult to imagine being able to meet everyone's requirements. This is also necessary to ask the parties concerned to understand the country's difficulties.
	If the grain department makes due efforts, and all relevant parties can realistically explain the truth, the personnel participating in the Sanmenxia construction will be satisfied, and our supply work can be done well.

    “兵马未发，粮草先行”
    粮食部章乃器部长的书面谈话
    “兵马未发，粮草先行”，我们粮食部门就是以这样的精神，担负起工业、交通建设和农业开垦事业“打前站”的任务的。征服黄河是我国历史上的一件极其伟大的事情，三门峡枢纽工程又是征服黄河工作中的第一个规模空前巨大的建设；我们粮食部门当然会十分重视这一工程，以无比愉快的心情负担起“打前站”的光荣任务，而且下决心要把粮食供应工作做好。我们已经在三门峡设立了粮食局。
    我们知道，参加这一工程的工作人员，除了大量的当地民工以外，还有许多来自各地的工程技术人员，而且还有我们的伟大盟邦苏联派来的专家；因此，供应的工作是很复杂的。我们必须充分了解他们的不同的消费习惯；尽可能地组织不同的粮种和不同的品级，适当地满足他们的要求。但是，由于去年遭受了严重的天灾，我们在粮种的调剂中遇到了一些困难；同时，粮种的调剂有时会违反合理运输的路线，浪费国家的运输力量；因此，也很难设想能够满足每一个人的要求。这又是必须请求有关方面体谅国家的困难的。
    粮食部门尽了应有的努力，各有关方面又能实事求是地讲清楚道理，参加三门峡建设的人员是会满意的，我们的供应工作是可以做好的。
