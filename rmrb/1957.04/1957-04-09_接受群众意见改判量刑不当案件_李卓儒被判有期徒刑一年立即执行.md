Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 8th. In the case of Li Zhuoru, Director of the Guangzhou Municipal Sports Commission Office, who overstepped his authority and violated the personal rights of citizens, leading to the suicide of Yi Xuxu, a staff member of the Sports Commission, the Guangzhou Intermediate People's Court, based on the opinion of the Guangdong Provincial Higher People's Court's criminal ruling, publicly retried the case on April 5th and re-sentenced the defendant Li Zhuoru to one year of imprisonment, to be executed immediately.

The Guangzhou Intermediate People's Court heard Li Zhuoru's human rights violation case on November 17th of last year. At that time, the defendant Li Zhuoru was sentenced to one year of imprisonment with a one-year reprieve. After the judgment was announced, many people felt that the sentence was too lenient. The Guangdong Provincial Higher People's Court carefully verified the materials of this case and issued a criminal ruling on January 12th of this year, revoking the original judgment and remanding the case to the Municipal Intermediate People's Court for retrial.

During his tenure as the Director of the Preparatory Office for the Ershatou Stadium of the Municipal Sports Commission, after Li Yuqiong, the general affairs staff of the office, reported to him about the loss of 20.08 yuan in meal expenses and some grain coupons, he did not report the case to the public security organs. Instead, he decided without authorization to conduct personal and residential searches of Yi Xuxu and three others who were standing by the table when Li Yuqiong collected the money. After a similar amount of cash was found on Yi Xuxu, he concluded that Yi Xuxu had stolen the money, and had a private talk with Yi Xuxu late that night. At that time, Yi Xuxu admitted to stealing the money. At six o'clock the next morning, the defendant Li Zhuoru personally presided over a cadre meeting to educate Yi Xuxu. Finally, Li Zhuoru, according to the suggestions of the masses, decided to give Yi Xuxu two days to reflect. Yi Xuxu was mentally stimulated and committed suicide on January 27th of last year.

At the criminal trial court of the Municipal Intermediate People's Court on April 5th, the state prosecutor who brought the public prosecution in this case pointed out in his speech that even if the victim Yi Xuxu was suspected of stealing the lost money at the time, even if the defendant Li Zhuoru's motivation at the time was indeed to clarify the issue of the lost money in order to educate the cadres, his agreement and decision to search and pursue Yi Xuxu, causing Yi Xuxu to be mentally stimulated and commit suicide, was an illegal act. Therefore, the defendant Li Zhuoru should be held responsible for the consequences of Yi Xuxu's suicide and must be given an appropriate criminal sentence.

After retrial of the Li Zhuoru case, the criminal trial court of the Guangzhou Intermediate People's Court decided to revise the sentence to one year of imprisonment, to be executed immediately.

    接受群众意见改判量刑不当案件
    李卓儒被判有期徒刑一年立即执行
    据新华社广州8日电　广州市体育运动委员会办公室主任李卓儒逾越职权，侵犯公民人身权利，促使体育运动委员会工作人员易煦煦自杀死亡一案，4月5日由广州市中级人民法院根据广东省高级人民法院刑事裁定书的意见依法公开再审，重新判处被告李卓儒有期徒刑一年，立即逮捕执行。
    李卓儒侵犯人权案，广州市中级人民法院曾在去年11月17日审理，当时判处被告李卓儒有期徒刑一年，缓刑一年。判决公布后，许多人民群众认为这个案件量刑轻了。广东省高级人民法院将这个案件的材料进行了详细核对，在今年1月12日发出刑事裁定书，撤销原判，将案件发还市中级人民法院再审。
    被告李卓儒在兼任市体育运动委员会二沙头运动场筹建办公室主任职务期间，在办公室总务黎玉琼向他报告了关于膳费二十元零八角和一些粮票失窃的情况后，他没有向公安机关报案，就擅自决定对在黎玉琼收钱时站在桌边的易煦煦等四人进行人身和住宅搜查。当从易煦煦身上搜出数额相近的钞票后，便认定钱是易煦煦偷的，并在当天深夜找易煦煦个别谈话。当时易煦煦承认了偷钱行为。第二天早晨六时，被告李卓儒亲自主持干部大会对易煦煦进行教育，最后，李卓儒依照群众建议，决定给易煦煦以两天时间进行反省。易煦煦精神受到刺激，在去年1月27日自杀。
    在4月5日市中级人民法院刑事审判庭上，对这一案件提出公诉的国家公诉人在发言中指出，即使被害人易煦煦当时是有偷窃失款的重大嫌疑，即使被告李卓儒当时的动机确实是出于弄清失款问题以教育干部，但是他同意和决定对易煦煦进行搜查和追逼斗争，致使易煦煦受到精神刺激而自杀死亡，这是违法的行为。因此，被告李卓儒对易煦煦的自杀死亡这一后果应负罪责，必须给予适当的刑事判处。
    广州市中级人民法院刑事审判庭对李卓儒案经过再审以后，决定依法改判有期徒刑一年，立即逮捕执行。
