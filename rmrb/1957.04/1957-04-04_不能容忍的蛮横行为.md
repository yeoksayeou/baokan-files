Intolerable Brutish Behavior
	Wu Zhouhang

A three-year-old child, because of measles complicated by pneumonia, became very ill. He was admitted to the branch of the First Affiliated Hospital of Shenyang Medical College on December 14th of last year for treatment. After doctors tried their best to save him, he eventually died on the 15th due to respiratory failure. After the patient died, his father, mother, and grandmother came to the ward and began to curse without explanation. The patient's grandmother and mother grabbed doctor Wang Cheng Lian and beat him on the head and face. His right eye was swollen, conjunctiva congested, and the eye socket was bruised. The patient's mother also took out a brick that she had hidden beforehand and suddenly hit nurse Su Konghui on the head, breaking her gums.

Li Shuzhong, a surgical inpatient at the First Affiliated Hospital (a staff member of the Xinmin County People's Committee in Liaoning Province), received an amputation surgery. Female intern doctor Wang Dacheng took very good care of him. On the day he was discharged from the hospital, because the doctor wrote in the diagnosis that he should rest for two weeks, he felt that the time was too short. He brought Dr. Wang over and whipped her twice forcefully with a belt. We know that the work of doctors is noble and should be respected. Beating doctors is not only wrong but also illegal. It is hoped that the responsible comrades of the First Affiliated Hospital of Shenyang Medical College, in conjunction with the local government and judicial organs, will seriously investigate and deal with this unreasonable and unlawful behavior that violates human rights.

    不能容忍的蛮横行为
    伍舟航
    有一个三岁小孩，因为得麻疹后合并肺炎，病势很重，于去年12月14日入沈阳医学院第一附属医院分院治疗，经医生多方抢救，终因病人呼吸衰竭，于15日死去。病人死后，他的父、母、祖母齐来病房，不容分说破口大骂。病儿的祖母和母亲抓住医生王成廉，向他头上脸上打一顿，当时右眼被打肿，结膜充血，眼眶青紫。病儿的母亲并把早已藏好的砖块拿出，突然向护士苏孔惠的头部打去，牙床被打破了。
    第一附属医院外科住院病人李树忠（辽宁省新民县人民委员会工作人员）作截肢手术后，女实习医生王大成非常热情地照顾他。在他病愈出院的当天，因为医生开的诊断书上给他休息的时间是二周，他认为太短，即把王大夫找来，抡起皮带用力打了她两皮带。我们知道，医生的劳动是高尚的，应当受到尊重。殴打医生不但是错误的，而且是犯法的行为。希望沈阳医学院第一附属医院的负责同志，会同当地政府和司法机关严肃追查和处理这种横不讲理的、侵犯人权的违法行为。
