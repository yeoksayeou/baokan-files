    Editor's Notes
    Jin Suozhen serving a paralyzed old man for twelve years as if it were one day is such a noble virtue and such admirable behavior.
    A staff member of a Party and state organ using a portion of their income to support the elderly and raise children is such an unshirkable responsibility. However, there are cadres like Lou Jianhua, Li Xiao... who treat their parents with an extremely ruthless attitude.
    In our society, people like Jin Suozhen should be respected, not people like Lou Jianhua and Li Xiao. May those who lack a sense of responsibility in their family life change their attitude!

    编后随笔
    金素珍十二年如一日地侍候一个瘫痪的老人，这是多么崇高的品德，这是多么值得尊敬的行为。
    一个党和国家机关的工作人员，以自己收入的一部分来赡养老人抚养子女，这是多么义不容辞的责任。可是，竟有像娄建华、李晓……这样的干部，用非常无情的态度来对待自己的父母。
    在我们的社会上，受到尊敬的应当是金素珍这样的人，而不是娄建华和李晓这样的人。愿那些在家庭生活中缺乏责任感的人改变自己的态度吧！
