    Sukarno Tells "Pravda" Reporter:
    Asian-African Conference Strengthens Anti-Colonial Struggle
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 18th: TASS, Moscow, April 18th: Indonesian President Sukarno gave a written statement to a "Pravda" reporter in Solo on April 17th regarding the international significance of the Bandung Conference.
    He said that the characteristic of the late 19th century and the current 20th century is the high tide of the struggle of all mankind for peace and against oppression and exploitation. This struggle is manifested in the West as a struggle for socialist transformation, and in the East as a struggle to overthrow imperialism and colonialism, and the latter is completely permeated with socialist tendencies. Colonialism is not only political oppression, but also material exploitation. Therefore, almost the entire anti-colonialist struggle also has an anti-capitalist nature.
    President Sukarno said that after the end of World War II, many Asian and African countries still failed to break free from the shackles of colonialism. Therefore, the fact that the Asian and African people united to participate in the Bandung Conference held two years ago is of great significance.
    He said that the impact of the unity of Asian and African countries is enormous. He believes that in Asian and African countries, this influence has strengthened the spirit of the struggle for independence and the spirit of unity against colonialism. For all freedom-loving people, this influence is also of great significance. A free Asia and a free Africa mark the consolidation of the freedom of all mankind.

    苏加诺对“真理报”记者说
    亚非会议加强了反殖民斗争
    据新华社18日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科18日讯：印度尼西亚共和国总统苏加诺4月17日在梭罗就万隆会议的国际意义问题对“真理报”记者发表了书面谈话
    他说，十九世纪后半叶和现在二十世纪的时代特征是全人类争取和平、反对压迫和剥削的斗争的高涨。这个斗争在西方表现为争取社会主义改造的斗争，在东方表现为争取推翻帝国主义和殖民主义的斗争，而后者是完全渗透着社会主义的倾向的。殖民主义不仅是政治压迫，同时也是物质剥削，因此，几乎整个反殖民主义的斗争同样也带有反资本主义的性质。
    苏加诺总统说，第二次世界大战结束以后，亚非许多国家仍然没能摆脱殖民主义的束缚。因此，亚非人民联合起来参加了两年以前召开的万隆会议这个事实，具有巨大的意义。
    他说，亚非国家团结起来的影响是巨大的。他认为，在亚非各国，这种影响加强了争取独立的斗争的精神，加强了团结起来反对殖民主义的精神。对整个爱好自由的人类来说，这种影响同样有着重大的意义。自由的亚洲和自由的非洲标志着全人类的自由的巩固。
