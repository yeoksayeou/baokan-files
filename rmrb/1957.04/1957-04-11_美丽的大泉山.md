Beautiful Daquan Mountain
By our reporter Tian Liu

    During a visit to the National Agricultural Exhibition, a series of paintings titled "A Model for Transforming Mountainous Areas" in the Forestry Pavilion deeply attracted me, and I stood in front of them for a long time.

    This series of paintings depicted Daquan Mountain. Those familiar, simple, and hardworking faces, those familiar, picturesque mountains, evoked happy memories. The scene of visiting Daquan Mountain half a year ago reappeared before my eyes.

Start from the Negative

    On the morning of August 13th, we set off from Yanggao County to visit Daquan Mountain. It was a beautiful morning. The newly risen sun painted the eastern half of the sky with brilliant golden light; but in the west, extending all the way to the outside of the Great Wall, the sky was as blue and transparent as the sea. The Great Wall, winding westward on the high mountains and ridges, looked even more majestic and magnificent.

    Daquan Mountain is a mountain village in Yanggao County. It had been famous for its soil and water conservation work for several years. However, before I saw it with my own eyes, I never imagined it would be so good.

    We entered Daquan Mountain just after noon. As often seen in movies, after turning two bends in the mountain gully, a new world suddenly appeared before us: lush greenery everywhere. The mountain peaks were surrounded by circles of trees, as if wearing many green garlands; between the two forest belts were layers of terraced fields with thriving crops. Under the trees and on the terraces, colorful mountain flowers bloomed everywhere. Pairs of butterflies flew back and forth. A gust of wind would stir the flowers and butterflies, making it difficult to distinguish between the mountain flowers and the butterflies.

    Li, the head of the Daquan Mountain Soil and Water Conservation Station, came a long way out of the village to meet us. He invited us to rest at the station before going up the mountain to visit. We couldn't refuse his hospitality, so we followed him to the Soil and Water Conservation Station. Li must have seen what we were thinking, and he smiled as he walked:
     "Passing by Phoenix Mountain on the way to the Soil and Water Conservation Station will help you understand the achievements of Lao Gao and Lao Zhang in governing Daquan Mountain."

    I knew who he was talking about when he said Lao Gao and Lao Zhang. I came to Daquan Mountain to visit Gao Jincai and Zhang Fenglin. Eighteen years ago, Zhang Fenglin, forced to wander around by poverty, came to Daquan Mountain; soon after, Gao Jincai, a farmhand who had his leg shot through by a landlord, also fled there. The two people who met in distress began to cultivate the mountain for survival. Life is always the best school, and failure often leads to success and victory. Over the past eighteen years, they have not only overcome hunger and poverty, but also accumulated many methods and experiences for conquering mountain floods, turning a barren mountain into a beautiful garden. After liberation, especially with the arrival of the socialist upsurge in the countryside, their experience in governing mountainous areas became a treasure. It goes without saying that Yanggao County and even the entire Shanxi Province are promoting their experience everywhere; Inner Mongolia, Gansu Province, Liaoning Province, and many other provinces have also been constantly sending people to learn from them.

    Turning into a small mountain gully on the left, and walking not far, we saw Phoenix Mountain. What kind of mountain is this! Looking at it from a distance, it is bare and red, like a red sorghum noodle dumpling; looking closer, the mountain slopes are full of bean-sized red gravel. Scientists call this kind of mountain weathered rock, which cannot withstand mountain floods, let alone a small wind, which will cause the sand to flow down like water. Li pointed to Phoenix Mountain and said to us:
    "See, this is what Daquan Mountain looked like eighteen years ago."

    Oh, so Li wanted us to understand Daquan Mountain from the negative side. But why is Phoenix Mountain still like this?
    "We haven't had time to govern it yet. Phoenix Mountain was only recently assigned to Daquan Mountain Township." Li explained, "However, we have already started. You see, the mountain slopes are already covered with fish-scale pits?"

The Test of Heavy Rain

    Li first led us to visit Danan Gully. That was the focus of soil and water conservation for the Daquan Mountain Township Agricultural Cooperative this year.

    What a big gully! You can't see the head—the head is buried deep in the mountains far away; you can't see the tail—the tail twists and turns to the village entrance below; looking down—it's like standing on a cliff, so deep it makes you dizzy. Li told us that fifty years ago, this was originally a flat and bright carriageway. Because of the floods coming down from the mountains, it slowly turned into a gully. Since this road was cut off, not only was it inconvenient for people to travel, but even the hundreds of acres of land on the opposite mountain slope were abandoned because fertilizer could not be transported in.

    "Gao Jincai and Zhang Fenglin have always wanted to govern this gully," Li said, "They have been thinking about it for eighteen years, but they couldn't do anything about it. It wasn't until the spring of this year, after the establishment of the advanced agricultural cooperative, that their ideals were realized."
     "Not to mention the hundreds of acres of land on the opposite mountain slope," Li added after a while, "this gully alone will add more than three hundred acres of land after it is repaired."

    Most of the gully has been repaired. On the repaired sections of the gully, there are pieces of land everywhere on the gully cliffs and in the gully bottom, some large pieces are three or five acres, and some small pieces are five or seven tenths of an acre. These lands are all repaired smoothly and neatly, and are no different from ordinary cultivated land; the only difference is that there is a thick earthen ridge surrounding each piece of land. From a distance, these pieces of land, which are raised higher than each other by earthen ridges, look very much like balconies extending from buildings, which are very beautiful. While we praised these neatly repaired fields, we were also a little worried for it: If there is a heavy rain, will they not be destroyed again?
    "No," Li said, "You see, the earthen ridges are more than a foot thick and more than two feet high. No matter how heavy the rain, it won't be more than two feet at a time. If the water doesn't flow into the field below, how will it be destroyed!" He led me down to the gully and stood on the hard earthen ridge. He added:
     "This is the experience that Gao Jincai and others have gained over the years in fighting against mountain floods. In the words of Lao Gao, this is called 'Water has concentration, I have diversion method'."

    The weather in the mountains is really changeable. When we set off from the station, the weather was fine, but in such a short time, the sky was full of dark clouds. Li looked up at the sky and said, "It's going to rain, let's go back." As if summoned by his words, before he finished speaking, a loud thunder crashed down from overhead; then, rain drops as big as copper coins fell down cracklingly.
    "Quick, quick," Li shouted, "let's take shelter in the earth cave first, it's too late to go back to the village."

    Originally, in the two cliffs of the gully, people had dug many small earth caves, especially to deal with this changeable weather. We just ran into the earth cave when the pouring rain came down. The rain was getting heavier and heavier. The clouds were getting denser and denser. The wind was howling like a mad beast, fierce and rude, and the sky was as dark as night.

    It looked like the rain would not stop for a while.

    People were afraid that the road would be even more difficult to walk if they waited any longer, and they ran back to the village in the rain. But I had other plans; I wanted to take this opportunity to see if the newly built land in the gully could withstand such a heavy rain. Seeing that I was not leaving, Li also stopped and sheltered from the rain with me.

    Thank goodness, after more than two hours, the rain finally stopped.

    We came out of the earth cave to see the land in the gully, and sure enough, none of it had been destroyed by the rain. What surprised me most was that after such a heavy rain, not a single drop of water flowed into the gully from the mountain. When I asked Li, I learned that this was also the experience of Gao Jincai and others: To govern the mountains and repair the gullies, we must govern comprehensively from top to bottom, and govern the slopes before repairing the gullies. In order to show me the effect of this experience, Li specially led me to climb a small earth ridge; standing on the earth ridge, we could see the top of the gully and the mountain slope above the top of the gully. On the mountain slope, many fish-scale pits and reservoirs have been built, and a low wall-like gully head ridge has been built at the top of the gully. Li pointed to the various soil and water conservation projects on the mountain and said to me:
     "If it weren't for those projects, who knows how big a mountain flood would have occurred after such a heavy rain!"

    Li introduced me to the situation of soil erosion in this area. This summer, the Soil and Water Conservation Station conducted an experiment to observe soil erosion in an ungoverned mountain gully. The mountain gully was very small, with an area of only twenty acres. The rain on August 2nd—the rainfall was twenty-two millimeters, the rainfall time was one and a half hours, the rain was not too heavy, nor too fierce, but it washed away 8,088 kilograms of soil.
    "On an area of twenty acres, a rain washes away eight thousand kilograms of soil," Li concluded heavily, "Soil that sixteen large carts can move!"

    Thinking of the terrible soil erosion situation, and then looking at the safe and sound land in front of me—what magnificent achievements can people create!

We Must Look Up To the Mountain

    The homes of Gao Jincai and Zhang Fenglin are on a mountainside surrounded by flowers, plants, and trees. The entire governance of Daquan Mountain began from where they live. As soon as we walked into the gate, Zhang Fenglin greeted us from the house with a smile. Zhang Fenglin is around fifty years old, of medium build, with a broad forehead, and his eyes often look diagonally at the ground, as if he is always thinking about something. He warmly shook hands with us and invited us to sit in the house. However, the fruit trees and flowers in the yard kept people in the yard, and no one wanted to go into the house. Li went to cool off under the fruit trees, I sat at a long stone table in the flower bushes to rest, and several county cadres who came with me surrounded a lacquer tree whose leaves looked very much like sycamore trees, wondering why the lacquer tree grew in the north. Zhang Fenglin picked two baskets full of sand fruits and plums from the tree for us to eat, repeatedly saying enthusiastically: "Homegrown, comrades, try some." After eating the fruit, Zhang Fenglin personally led us to visit the mountain. As soon as we arrived on the mountain, people were fascinated by the scenery in front of and behind the mountain. Who could not be fascinated? Look, the mountains surrounded by strips of forest belts, the layers of terraced fields growing crops like forests and walls, the fruit trees in one gully after another, that... as long as you open your eyes and look around, where is there no enchanting beauty!

    These days, Li has introduced me to Daquan Mountain before it was governed more than once. He said that it was originally a desolate gravel bag, where crops did not grow, there were no trees, and even weeds were hard to find. But now, on such a large Daquan Mountain, you can no longer see a barren slope with bare gravel—the mountain slopes are covered with flowers and full of crops and trees; you can no longer find a deep gully—dozens of gullies have been turned into fields connected to each other, nurturing gully after gully of fruit tree forests. It is really like what Zhang Fenglin introduced to us: "Peach, apricot, pine, and poplar trees grow on the mountain, and grains and miscellaneous grains are planted on the slopes; the trees bear dried and fresh fruits, and yam and radishes are harvested underground."

    The great achievements of soil and water conservation and the picturesque scenery of Daquan Mountain made us forget the time. If the noisy young people suddenly appearing on the opposite mountain slope had not attracted our attention, we might have stayed on the mountain for a long time.

    That group of young people who were laughing and walking down the mountain was the famous youth basic construction team of Daquan Mountain Township Agricultural Cooperative. Gao Jincai is their captain. Zhang Fenglin pointed to the group of happy young people and said:
     "This is also a major advantage of the agricultural cooperative. Earlier, when Gao Jincai and I were governing the mountains and repairing the gullies, we had few people, and many things could not be done. After the advanced cooperativization, this youth team was established, and agricultural production and mountain management are not delayed!"

    We wanted to see Gao Jincai and the youth team he led, so we hurried down the mountain. When we arrived at the home of Gao Jincai and Zhang Fenglin, the young people had already arrived first. Some were washing their faces, some were wiping their farm tools, and more were reading newspapers in the shade of the trees. Gao Jincai was very happy when he heard that we wanted to learn about the youth team, and he said with a smile:
     "It should be, it should be, in the past, people who came to visit always looked for us, but in fact, it is all their credit." He looked at the young people affectionately, and then continued, "These young lads are really good, everyone is clever and skillful. Since the youth team was established in March, they have learned all the methods of repairing gullies along the mountains that we have learned in eighteen years in just half a year." He paused for a while, wiped the sweat from his forehead with the back of his hand,
    "They are simply a group of little tigers when they start working. Lao Zhang and I have governed less than four hundred acres of mountain slopes in ten years, and they have governed more than 11,000 acres in half a year. Wait and see, in three to five years, all the mountains here will become like Daquan Mountain."

    Was he praising these lovely young people, or was he looking forward to the happy tomorrow of his hometown? An irrepressible inner joy and pride burned his slightly thin cheeks red.
    "Not only engaged in basic construction," Li added,
     "The youth team also has production income. Under the leadership of Gao Jincai, they combined basic construction projects such as slope repair, gully management, tree planting, and flood prevention with agricultural production. While digging fish-scale pits, they planted beans in the fish-scale pits; while repairing embankment, they planted melons and vegetables on the embankment. Not counting the governance of more than 10,000 acres of mountain slopes, a labor day also has a production income of more than one yuan, which is not less than the income that the agricultural team adds to the cooperative."

    While visiting the mountain, Zhang Fenglin had already talked to us a lot about the experience of governing the mountainous areas, and I also wanted to hear Lao Gao's opinion.
    "What experience is there!" Lao Gao said uneasily,
     "As long as people are willing to work and look up to the mountain, they can govern the mountain well."

    This is the experience, the real experience! I remembered what Zhang Fenglin had said on the mountain with the same meaning:
     "There are poor people, there are lazy people, but there are no poor mountains and barren mountains; if you love the mountains and govern the mountains, how can there be poor mountains and barren mountains?"

    ＊
    The people in the exhibition hall are slowly decreasing. The glow of the setting sun shines in from outside the window, shining on the simple and confident faces of Zhang Fenglin and Gao Jincai, shining on the beautiful Daquan Mountain. Dear comrades, in the coming of another spring to the world, how much spring will you add to your hometown, to Daquan Mountain? (With pictures)

    This is today's Daquan Mountain, with dense forests already covering the mountains and fields. (All the pictures in the article are taken by Xinhua News Agency reporter Lu Ke)

    This is Gao Jincai (right one), Zhang Fenglin (right two) and their families together. Gao Jincai has successively won the honorary titles of Provincial Agricultural Abundance Model and Afforestation Model since 1952, and Zhang Fenglin has also been selected as an afforestation activist in Shanxi Province.

    Members of the Daquan Mountain Township Agricultural Cooperative are pruning trees.

    美丽的大泉山
    本报记者　田流
      参观全国农业展览会的时候，林业馆一组标题是“改造山区的榜样”的组画，深深地吸引着我，使我很久地站在它的面前。
      这组画说的是大泉山。那熟悉的淳朴而勤劳的面孔，那熟悉的美丽如画的山峦，唤起了我快乐的回忆。半年前访问大泉山时的情景，又一一展现在眼前了。
    先从反面看
    8月13日早晨，我们从阳高县城出发，到大泉山去访问。那是个美丽的早晨。刚刚升起的太阳，把东边半个天空都涂上了灿烂的金光；可是在西方，在一直延伸到长城外面的远方，天空又像大海一样，碧蓝得透明发亮。在高山峻岭上蜿蜒西去的万里长城，显得更雄伟更壮丽了。
    大泉山是阳高县的一个山村。好几年前，就因为水土保持工作出名了。可是，在我亲眼看到它以前，怎么也没想到它会有这样好。
    我们是刚刚过午的时候进入大泉山的。像看电影的时候常会看到的情形一样，才在山沟里拐了两个湾，眼前就突然出现了一片新天地：满眼葱翠。山头都被一圈一圈的树林子环绕着，好像戴着很多绿色的花环；两条林带中间，是长着茁壮稼禾的层层梯田。树林下和地阶上，到处开着五颜六色的山花。双双对对的蝴蝶，往来飞翔。一阵小风吹来，也会招惹得花摇蝶舞，简直让人分不清哪是山花，哪是蝴蝶。
    大泉山水土保持工作站李站长，走出村老远来接我们。他邀我们先到站上休息一下，再去山上参观。盛情难却，只好跟着他先到水土保持工作站去。李站长准是看出了我们的心思，一面走一面笑着说：
      “去水土保持工作站路过凤凰山，先看看凤凰山对你们了解老高、老张他们治理大泉山的成绩更有帮助。”
    我知道他说的老高、老张是谁。就是为的访问高进才、张凤林二人，我才到大泉山来的。十八年前，被穷困逼迫得到处流浪的张凤林，来到大泉山；不久，被地主用枪打穿了腿的长工高进才，也逃来了。两个在患难中相逢的人，为着活下去，开始刨山种地。生活永远是最好的学校，失败常常会引向成功和胜利。十八年来，他二人不光战胜了饥饿和穷困，更积累了很多治服山洪水患的办法和经验，把一座荒山秃岭变成了美丽的花园。解放以后，特别是农村的社会主义高潮到来以后，他们治理山区的经验，简直成了宝贝。阳高县以至全山西省，到处推广他们的经验，自不必说；内蒙古、甘肃省、辽宁省和很多别的省份，也都不断地派人来学习。
    拐进左边的一条小山沟，往前走不远，就看见凤凰山了。这算是什么样的山啊！远远望去，光秃秃，红焰焰，简直像个红高粱面窝窝头；近前一瞧，满山满坡，尽是些豆粒样的红砂子。这种山，科学家叫它风化岩，不用说经不起山洪冲涮，就是刮阵小风，那砂子也会像水一样??地往下流。李站长指着凤凰山，对我们说：
    “看见了么，十八年前，大泉山就是这个样子。”
    噢，原来李站长是要我们从反面了解一下大泉山。但是，为什么凤凰山还是这个样子呢？
    “还没来得及治理。凤凰山是新近不久才划归大泉山乡的。”李站长解释说，“不过，我们已经开始了。你看，山坡上不是已经到处挖上鱼鳞坑了？”
    大雨的考验
    李站长先领我们去大南沟参观。那是大泉山乡农业社今年水土保持的重点。
    好大一条沟！前看不到头——头钻到老远老远的山里去了；后望不到尾——尾左湾右拐伸到下面村口去了；朝下一瞧——像站在悬崖峭壁上，深得让人头晕。李站长告诉我们：五十年前，这里原是一条平坦明光的大车道。因为山上下来的洪水冲涮，慢慢地变成了沟。自从这条道路断绝后，不光人来往行走不方便了，连对面山坡上那几百亩地，因为运不进肥料去，也撂荒了。
    “高进才、张凤林一直想治理这条沟，”李站长说，“想了十八年，一直也不能动手。直到今年春天，全乡成立起高级农业社以后，他们的理想才实现了。”
      “不说对面山坡上那几百亩地，”过了一会，李站长又补充说，“光这条沟，修好后就能增加三百多亩土地。”
    沟已经修好大半段了。修好的沟段上，沟崖上、沟底里到处都是一块块的土地，块大的有三、五亩，块小的也有五、七分。这些地都修得平平整整，和普通的耕地没有什么两样；所不同的，只是每块地的前面还有一道厚厚的土埂围绕着。远远望去，这些被土埂拦起来的一块比一块高的土地，很像楼房上伸出来的一个个阳台，十分好看。我们一面赞美这修得整整齐齐的田地，一面又替它有点耽心：要是下一场大雨，不会再把它们冲坏吗？
      “不会。”李站长说，“你看那土埂都是一尺多厚，二尺多高。再大的雨，一次也下不了二尺多。水流不到下面一块田里去，怎么会冲坏呢！”他领我下到沟里，站在那坚硬的土埂上。又补充说：
      “这是高进才他们多年向山洪水患作斗争摸出来的经验。用老高他们的话说，这叫‘水有集中性，我有分水法’。”
    山地里的天气真是变化无常。我们从站上出发的时候，天气还是好好的，就这么一会儿工夫，竟满天乌云了。李站长抬头看看天，说：“要下雨了，咱们回吧。”好像是他的话召来的，语音未落，一声巨雷，从头顶上盖下来；接着，铜钱大的雨点就劈劈拍拍地落下来。
    “快快，”李站长喊道，“先到土洞里避一下吧，来不及回村了。”
    原来，在沟的两崖里，人们挖了许多小土洞，专门对付这变化无常的天气。我们刚跑进土洞，瓢泼的大雨就浇下来了。雨一阵比一阵大。云一阵比一阵浓。风像发狂了的野兽，凶暴而粗野地嚎叫着，天空阴暗得像黑夜了。
    看样子，雨一时半时是不会停下来的。
    人们怕再等下去路更不好走，冒着雨跑回村去了。但我却有另外的打算；想借这个机会，看看沟里新修出来的土地，究竟能不能经得住这样大雨的冲击。李站长见我不走，他也停下来和我一块避雨。
    谢天谢地，两个多钟头以后，雨终于停了。
    我们钻出土洞去看沟里的土地，果然一块也没有被雨冲坏。最使我奇怪的是，下这么大雨，山上竟没有一点水流到沟里来。一问李站长，才知道这又是高进才他们的经验：治山修沟要从上往下全面治理，修沟以前先治坡，坡治好了再修沟。李站长为了叫我看看这经验的效果，特意领我爬上一个小土岗；站在土岗上，一直可以望见沟顶和沟顶上的山坡。山坡上修了许多鱼鳞坑、蓄水池，沟顶地方还筑着一道矮墙似的沟头埂。李站长指着山上的各种水土保持工程，对我说：
    “要不是那些工程，下这么大雨，还不知道要闹多大的山洪呢！”
    李站长向我介绍了这一带水土流失的情形。这年夏天，水土保持工作站曾作过一个试验，在没有治理的一条山沟里观测水土流失。那条山沟很小，只有二十亩面积。8月2日那场雨——降雨量是二十二公厘，降雨时间是一小时半，雨不算太大，也不太猛，可是竟冲走了八千零八十八公斤泥土。
    “二十亩大的面积上，一场雨就冲走八千公斤泥土，”李站长沉重地结束说，“十六辆大车才能拉得动的泥土啊！”
    想着那样可怕的水土流失情形，再看看眼前这安然无恙的土地——人能创造出多么奇伟的业绩啊！
    要看得起山
    高进才和张凤林的家，在一个花草林木环绕着的山腰里。整个大泉山的治理工作就是从他们住的这地方开始的。我们刚走进大门，张凤林就微笑着从屋里迎出来。张凤林五十上下年纪，中等身材，宽脑门，眼睛常好平斜地望着地下，好像总在思索着什么。他热情地同我们握手，邀我们进屋里坐。可是院子里的果树、鲜花把人们留在院子里，谁也不肯进屋去。李站长去果树下乘凉，我坐在花丛中一个长条石桌旁休息，同来的几个县干部围在一棵叶子很像梧桐的漆树旁边，奇怪着漆树为什么长到北方来了。张凤林从树上摘下来满满两篮子沙果和李子给我们吃，一再热情地说：“家里出的，同志们都尝尝。”吃过水果，张凤林亲自领我们到山上去参观。刚到山上，人们就被山前山后的景色迷住了。谁能不入迷呢？看吧，那被一条条林带环绕着的山峦，那生长着如林似墙的庄稼的层层梯田，那一沟一沟的果树，那……只要一张眼一举目，哪里不是魅人的美景！
    这几天，李站长不止一次地给我介绍过没治理时候的大泉山了。说它本来是一个荒凉的砂石包，不长庄稼，没有林木，就是杂草也难得看见几棵。可是现在呀，这样大一架大泉山上，再也看不见一处砂石裸露的荒坡了——山坡上已经开遍了鲜花，长满了庄稼和树木；再也找不到一条深沟大壑了——几十条沟壑里，都已修成了一块连一块的田地，抚育起一沟又一沟的果树林。真像张凤林给我们介绍时说的：“山上长着桃杏松杨，坡面种着五谷杂粮；树上结的干鲜水果，地下收的山药萝卜。”
    大泉山上水土保持的巨大成就和美丽如画的景致，使我们把时间也忘记了。要不是对面山坡上忽然出现了喧闹着的青年人引起我们的注意，说不定要在山上逗留多久哩。
    那群说呀笑地走下山来的青年人，是大泉山乡农业社有名的青年基本建设队。高进才是他们的队长。张凤林指着那群快活的青年人说：
    “这也是农业社的一大优越性。早先，高进才我们俩治山修沟的时候，人手少，好些事作不来。高级合作化以后，成立起这个青年队，农业生产和治理山地什么都误不了啦！”
    我们想去看看高进才和他领导的青年队，就匆匆地走下山来。走到高进才、张凤林家时，青年们已经先到了。他们有的正洗脸，有的在擦自己的农具，更多的人在树荫里看报。高进才听说我们想了解一些青年队的事情，非常高兴，笑容满面地说：
    “应该应该，以前参观的人来了总是找我们，其实都是他们的功劳。”他爱抚地望了望青年们，又接着说，“这伙青年后生们真行，个个心灵手巧，3月里成立起青年队，到眼下才半年工夫，把我们十八年摸到的沿山修沟的办法都学会了。”他停了一会儿，用手背擦擦额头上的汗，
    “他们哪，干起营生来简直是群小老虎。我和老张十大几年共治理了不到四百亩山坡，他们半年工夫就治理了一万一千多亩。等着瞧吧，用不了三年五载，我们这儿所有的山，就都变成大泉山一样了。”
    他是赞扬这伙可爱的青年人呢，还是向往着家乡幸福的明天？一种抑压不住的内心的喜悦和自豪，把他那略微有些清瘦的面颊都烧红了。
    “不光搞基本建设，”李站长补充说，
    “青年队还有生产收入哩。他们在高进才领导下，把修坡治沟、植树防洪等基本建设工程和农业生产结合起来。一面挖鱼鳞坑，一面就在鱼鳞坑里点豆子；一面修塄堰，一面就在塄堰上安瓜菜。治理了一万多亩山坡还不算，一个劳动日还有一元多的生产收入，比农业队给社里增加的收入少不了多少。”
    在山上参观的时候，张凤林已经跟我们谈过很多治理山区的经验了，我也想听听老高的意见。
    “有什么经验哩！”老高不安地说，
    “人只要肯劳动，看得起山，就能把山治好。”
    这就是经验呀，真正的经验！我想起在山上张凤林说过的同样意思的话：
    “有穷人，有懒汉，没有穷山荒山；爱护山，治理山，哪有穷山荒山？”
                                        ＊
    展览馆里的人慢慢少起来了。夕阳的光辉从窗子外射进来，照在张凤林、高进才那纯朴的充满信心的脸上，照在美丽的大泉山上。亲爱的同志，在又一个春天来到人间的时候，你们将要给自己的家乡，给大泉山增添上几多春色？（附图片）
    这是今日的大泉山，密茂的林木已经是漫山遍野了。　（文中图片均为新华社记者　陆　轲摄）
    这是高进才（右一）、张凤林（右二）和家人们在一起。高进才从1952年来连续获得了省农业丰产模范和造林模范的光荣称号，张凤林也被选为山西省的造林积极分子。
    大泉山乡农业社的社员们正在进行林木的剪枝工作。
