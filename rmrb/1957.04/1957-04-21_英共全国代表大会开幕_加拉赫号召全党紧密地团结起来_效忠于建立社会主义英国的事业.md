Xinhua News Agency, London, 20th -- The 25th National Congress of the British Communist Party opened here on the 19th. William Gallacher, a veteran of the British communist movement and honorary chairman of the British Communist Party, issued a warm appeal to the congress, calling on everyone to make this congress a means of clearing away all doubts and difficulties, thereby uniting the party closely, "unwaveringly and indomitably dedicating themselves to the great cause of building a socialist Britain."

	The chairman of the party, Harry Pollitt, presided over this congress. A total of five hundred and fifty voting delegates attended the congress.

	Gallacher's opening speech said that since the 24th National Congress, the British Communist Party has had to face issues that have aroused intense emotions and serious discussions within the party. He pointed out that these issues were mainly some facts revealed at the 20th Congress of the CPSU and the Hungarian events. He said that the bourgeoisie used these issues to launch an extremely rampant attack on us through various propaganda organs. "We should be proud of those great comrades of our party, and at the same time we regret that some people we trusted have fallen halfway. I hope that many of these people will soon find a way to return to our ranks."

	Gallacher pointed out that discussions on these issues were encouraged within the party. The party is not without shortcomings in further expanding democratic discussion, "but domestically, the democracy within our party is more than any other political party."

	Gallacher said: "Our party has a lot of work to do, and although we can discuss, we must not ignore the work before us."

	Gallacher then focused on the relationship between the interests of the British working class and the interests of the international working class. He said: "We are a British party, and therefore must always strive to combine the specific conditions here in Britain to seek the interests of the British working class and serve the interests of the British working class. But at the same time, we must always remember our international responsibilities—remembering the fact that in the struggle for peace and socialism, the powerful Soviet Union is both a fighter and a leader."

	He said, "In this very decisive struggle, it is not enough for us to merely declare ourselves allies of the Soviet Union, loyal allies. We must win over the workers of our own country as their allies. The more we make the workers understand the British characteristics of our policies and programs, the more effectively we will serve them, and the more we will help our allies in the Soviet Union, liberated China, the various people's democratic countries, the colonial people, and our comrades in capitalist countries."

	The opening speech also revealed the essence of the policies of the right-wing leaders of the British Labour Party and the importance of the struggle for peace to the communists.

	Gallacher's opening speech was read by Pollitt on his behalf. Subsequently, the congress adopted the procedures for conducting the work of the congress and re-electing the party's leading organs.

	The party's General Secretary, John Gollan, made a political report to the congress that day.

    英共全国代表大会开幕
    加拉赫号召全党紧密地团结起来
    效忠于建立社会主义英国的事业
    新华社伦敦20日电　英国共产党第二十五届全国代表大会19日在这里开幕。英国共产主义运动老战士、英共名誉主席威廉·加拉赫向大会发出了热诚的呼吁，号召大家使这次大会成为扫清一切疑虑和困难的手段，从而把党紧密地团结起来，“不可动摇地、牢不可破地效忠于建立社会主义英国的伟大事业”。
    党的主席哈里·波立特担任这次代表大会的主席。出席大会的一共有五百五十名有表决权的代表。
    加拉赫的开幕辞说，自从第二十四届代表大会以来，英国共产党不得不面临那些在党内引起了激烈情绪和认真讨论的问题。他指出这些问题主要是苏共第二十次代表大会上揭露的一些事实和匈牙利事件。他说，资产阶级利用这些问题通过各种各样的宣传机构向我们发动了极为猖狂的进攻。“我们应当以我们党的那些伟大的同志们自豪，同时我们感到遗憾，我们所信任的某些人却半途倒下去了。我希望，这些人中有许多人不久会设法回到我们的队伍中来。”
    加拉赫指出，关于这些问题的讨论在党内是受到鼓励的。在进一步扩大民主的讨论方面党并非没有缺点，“但是在国内，我们党内的民主比任何其他政党要多”。
    加拉赫说：“我们党有着许多工作要做，虽然我们可以讨论，可是我们一定不能忽视摆在我们面前的工作。”
    加拉赫然后着重谈到了英国工人阶级利益同国际工人阶级利益之间的关系的问题。他说：“我们是英国的党，因此必须始终努力结合英国这里的具体情况来谋求英国工人阶级的利益和为英国工人阶级的利益服务。但是同时我们又必须始终记住我们的国际责任——记住在争取和平和社会主义的斗争中，强大的苏联是战士又是领导的事实。”
    他说，“在这个十分决定性的斗争中，我们仅仅宣布我们自己是苏联的盟友，忠实的盟友是不够的。我们必须争取本国的工人作为他们的盟友。我们愈是使工人认识我们的政策和纲领的英国特性，我们就是愈加有效地为他们服务，我们对我们的在苏联、解放了的中国、各人民民主国家的盟友、殖民地人民和我们在资本主义国家中的同志的帮助也就愈大。”
    开幕辞还揭露了英国工党右翼领导的政策实质以及争取和平的斗争对于共产党人的重要意义。
    加拉赫的开幕辞是由波立特代为宣读的。接着，代表大会通过了进行大会工作和改选党的领导机构的程序。
    党的总书记约翰·高兰向这一天大会作了政治报告。
