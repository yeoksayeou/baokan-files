    Miners' Nursing Home
    Li Migao

    One clear morning in mid-March, a friend and I went to the Fuxin Nursing Home for Coal Miners in China.

    The small train unique to the mining area took us to a place less than half a kilometer from the nursing home. As a red building came closer, my companion said, "That's it. There's a flowerbed in front of the door, and more than ninety elderly miners live inside. They've all worked in the coal mine for more than thirty years." What I saw was a neatly trimmed patch of old pines and cypresses, but the flowers in the flowerbed were still wrapped in burlap, not yet awakened from their winter sleep.

    Several elderly people in black cotton-padded clothes were sunning themselves in a sheltered corner of the wall. Some leaned against the wall, stroking their long beards, leisurely watching the evergreen pine trees in front of them; others strolled back and forth easily. When the old people saw guests coming, they greeted us warmly: "Come inside and rest, warm up."

    The Realm of Beauty

    Crossing the threshold, we were greeted by a burst of quaint and light music, giving a sense of tranquility. Several elderly people were sitting beside the loudspeaker, some chatting, some closing their eyes to rest. The director of the nursing home, who received us, drank tea with us for a while, and then suggested, "Let's go and see the dormitories of the nursing home residents!" — "Nursing home residents," this title, which is still quite unfamiliar to people, is what Chinese workers have won through countless struggles and the cost of much blood and sweat!

    We went upstairs first. A spacious room was where the elderly people carried out recreational activities. The four walls were covered with pictures, slogans, and pennants. The surroundings of the chess, checkers, and carrom tables were filled with white-haired, long-bearded people. An old man with graying hair and beard was concentrating on aiming with a carrom cue, his movements were light, skilled, and serious; the old people watching the fun were either helping him plan the route of the shot or praising his accurate technique. There were also two rows of long tables in the room, and several elderly people were sitting around the tables, flipping through picture books, comic books, and other newspapers and periodicals.

    The corridors upstairs and downstairs were very clean and filled with pots of flowers. Green willowleaf peach trees, furry cacti, and bright red begonias made people feel like they were walking into a winter flower greenhouse, feeling very refreshed.

    Many paintings were hanging on the walls on both sides of the corridor. There were colorful paintings of the grand occasion of the founding ceremony in front of Tiananmen Square, four-panel screens of "The Butterfly Lovers," wisteria and lanterns by Qi Baishi... "These are all decorations in the rooms, why are they placed in the corridor?" I was wondering when the director said, "There are New Year pictures and potted plants in every room. These are all things that the nursing home residents like, and most of them bought them themselves."

    We walked through the old people's bedrooms one by one, and the warmth from the heating was like spring. The bedrooms generally had three beds, and they were very clean inside.

    "If I Were Forty Years Younger"

    In one bedroom, an old man was drinking tea. When he saw guests coming, he hurried to get up and greet them. The director introduced, "This is Niu Ziheng, the chairman of the Nursing Home Committee." Niu Ziheng is a sixty-four-year-old man, with gray hair, a mustache, a dignified demeanor, and steady speech. I sat on his bed. There were two floral paintings on the opposite wall. On a square table, there were two pots of flowers. He told me that one pot was "Cherry Bamboo" and the other was "Green Leaves and Red Beans."

    In this quiet and comfortable atmosphere, Niu Ziheng, the old man, enthusiastically introduced me to the life of the nursing home. "Our life is happy. We eat fine grains, and pork, chicken, and fish are constantly available. We also eat dumplings twice a week and steamed buns once a week. Clothing, shoes, and socks are all supplied by the state." I carefully inquired and found out that the state stipulates that the monthly expenditure for each nursing home resident is twenty-seven yuan. Food is sixteen yuan per month, pocket money is five yuan, and the remaining six yuan is used for bedding. The cost of bedding for each person per year is a total of seventy-two yuan.

    Niu Ziheng, the old man, said: "The country takes very good care of us. But,"—he looked at me and smiled—"people of our age are like children, they can't stay idle; there are twenty mu of vegetable fields in the yard, all of which are taken care of by hired people, and many of us also volunteer to do some work. We don’t work for nothing. If we can't finish eating the vegetables, we have to sell them. The money we sell is divided among everyone. Those who don't work only eat vegetables and don't get any money. Look, how free is our life! If it were in the old society, at least half of us would have died. Think about it, how can we not thank Chairman Mao!"

    Then, Niu Ziheng, the old man, told me about his decades of life as a miner. He said: "I am from Hebei. When I was young, my family was so poor that I had no choice but to 'break into Guandong' at the age of twenty. I first went to the Tonghua Coal Mine, then to the Benxi Coal Mine; later I went to the Qianjinzai Mine, which is now Fushun, and I worked here for more than twenty years. When I first went to the coal mine, it was heaven and earth compared to now!

    "It was in October when I was recruited by the foreman to Benxi as a miner. People didn't treat us like humans, they called us 'coal blacks,' and we had to go to the toilet in groups, with someone watching with a pickaxe handle, for fear of running away. As for the labor conditions, there was no way to mention them. The first time, I was sent to the 'water face,' where the water was flowing, and my legs were soaked white, and I got bone joint pain. Later, I was sent to a 'fire face,' which was so hot that a cake could be cooked in twenty minutes. I also got 'fire blindness.' Later, I went to the 'gas face,' which was even more painful. Where are the labor protection supplies like we have now? We get rubber shoes, gloves, masks, work clothes, and health meals. At that time, we were only given a pair of cloth shoes, which were still 'Sunday shoes,' and the price was twice as expensive as on the market. Where were the mine lamps? We walked into the face in the dark, only carrying an acorn bread, and when we were thirsty, we had to drink the water flowing from the mine shaft. Alas, I don't know how much coal slag I drank! We worked for twelve hours, and if we worked overtime, we didn't know how many hours it was."

    He paused and continued depressingly: "As for suffering, we poor brothers can still endure it, but if we get sick, we can't endure it anymore. If you want to rest, you can't. If the Japanese see you, they'll beat you over the head with a stick, beat you unconscious, and you still have to work for them! Alas, if you can't eat enough, can't keep warm, and are so tired that you're dying, how can you have the heart to work! Some people got seriously ill, and even though they were still breathing, the Japanese and the foremen dragged them out and sent them to the mortuary. Every day, a batch of them had to be sent in there. Some of them were dragged out by carts before they even stopped breathing, and thrown naked into a big pit like stray dogs..."

    The corners of Niu Ziheng's eyes were a little wet, and our conversation stopped. At this time, the sun was shining brightly outside the window, and the loudspeaker was broadcasting the Beijing opera "Borrowing Arrows with Straw Boats." Niu Ziheng, the old man, took a sip of tea and picked up the topic and continued:

    "Comrade, you are still young, you haven't seen that kind of world. But, you should have heard of it! Which coal mine doesn't have a 'mass grave'! The Japanese devils didn't treat us like humans. They said: 'It's good to die, there are plenty of Chinese people!' Comrade, listen to what they're saying? Who could have imagined today? Alas—the old man stopped his words again, and after a while, he said with infinite emotion—my young and strong body was tortured by the Japanese bandits. I haven't been able to do much for the new society, and I feel ashamed of today's life! If I were forty years younger, how great that would be! … Young comrades, make more contributions to the new society!"

    A Happy Retirement

    The elderly people live comfortably here and receive cordial care from all aspects. Every year during festivals, the Fuxin Municipal Party Secretary, the Mining Bureau Director, and the Chairman of the Trade Union always come to express their regards to the elderly. Once, a director of the Fuxin Mining Bureau suggested that the elderly launch a "longevity competition," which they were very interested in. Sun Baolin, a seventy-six-year-old man, was very excited when he mentioned this. He said: "I want to live to be one hundred and twenty years old and see what a communist society is like!"

    Sun Baolin is an optimistic old man with silver-white hair and a short beard; although his teeth have all fallen out, his face is still very ruddy. It is said that in order to give this old man dentures, the director had "mobilized" him several times, but the old man still refused. He said: "Save some money for the country, I can still eat without teeth." The director told me that when this old man first came in 1952, he coughed and spat phlegm all day long, and his body was extremely weak. After several years of recuperation, his spirit has improved year by year. Now he no longer spits phlegm, and his cough has long since healed. He gets up for a walk before dawn every day, and his life is very regular. It is said that this is fulfilling the "competition" plan.

    This old man, in those days, because he could not bear the oppression of the Japanese, once picked up a stick and broke the head of a Japanese foreman. He himself was injured at the time, and now there is still a scar on his forehead. In the era of puppet rule, daring to pick up a wooden stick and injure a Japanese foreman, what a strong resistance this was! When I was talking with this old man, there were three million workers in Japan taking strike action to demand wage increases, and the 160,000 union members of the fourteen major companies affiliated with the Japanese Miners' Union also took a seventy-two-hour general strike action in fifty-two mines across the country. In this country with the beautiful Mount Fuji, the workers are also awakening!

    Sun Baolin, the old man, told me that a Japanese delegation had come to the nursing home, and they took the picture newspaper, found the white-bearded old man in the photo and met him. That old man told them: "Our Chinese working class has become the masters of our own affairs, and that is why we have the life we have today. I hope that the old miners in Japan can also have such a good environment to spend their old age."

    On the way back, the words of Sun Baolin, the old man, stayed with me for a long time. Let all the workers in the world have such a happy old age!

    矿工养老院
    李弥高
    3月中旬一个晴朗的早晨，我同一位朋友一起到中国煤矿工人阜新养老院去。
    矿区特有的小火车，一直把我们送到离养老院不到一华里的地方。当一座红色楼房离我们愈来愈近的时候，我的同伴说：“就是那里。门前有一片花坛，里面住着九十多位老年矿工，他们都是在煤矿上工作了三十年以上的人。”我看到的是一片修剪得整整齐齐的苍松、翠柏，至于花坛里的花儿却还用麻布包扎着，冬眠未醒呢。
    几位穿着黑色棉衣的老人，正在墙角避风的地方晒太阳。有的倚着墙，抚摸着拖长的胡须，悠闲地望着眼前长青的松树；有的轻松地来回散步。老人们见到来了客人，很亲热地向我们打招呼：“屋里休息吧，暖和暖和。”
    美的境界
    跨过门弦，迎面传来一阵古雅轻盈的乐曲，给人一种幽静的感觉。扩音器旁坐着几位老人，有的在谈天，有的正闭目养神。接待我们的养老院院长，陪着我们喝了一会儿茶，就提议说：“还是到养老员的宿舍看看吧！”——“养老员”，这个人们还相当陌生的称号，是中国工人经过多少斗争，付出多少血汗才争取得来的呵！
    我们先到楼上。一个宽敞的屋子，是老人们进行文娱活动的地方。四壁满挂着画片、标语和锦旗。象棋、跳棋、克郎球台的四周，围满了白发长髯的人。一位花白胡须的老人，正聚精会神地拿着克郎球杆在描准，他的动作轻巧、熟练而又认真；旁边看热闹的老人，有的帮他策划击球的路线，有的为他准确的技巧发出赞叹。室内还有两排长长的桌子，几位老人正围桌而坐，在翻阅画报、小人书等报刊。
    楼上楼下的走廊都很洁净，并且摆着一盆一盆的鲜花。绿油油的柳叶桃，毛茸茸的仙人球，鲜艳的红海棠，使人好像走进冬天的花窖，感到十分清新。
    走廊两旁的墙壁上，悬挂着许多幅图画。有天安门前开国大典盛况的彩画，有“梁祝姻缘”的四扇屏，有齐白石的藤萝、灯笼……。“这些都是屋子里的摆设呀，怎么放在走廊呢？”我正在纳闷，院长说：“这些年画、盆景每个屋子里都有，这都是养老员们喜爱的东西，大部分是他们自己买的。”
    我们沿着老人们的卧室一间一间的走过，室内暖气扑面，温暖如春。卧室一般是三张床位，里面都很整洁。
    “假如我年青四十岁”
    在一间卧室里，一位老人正在喝茶。他看见来了客人，忙着起身招待。院长介绍说：“这就是养老委员会的主席牛子恒。”牛子恒是一位六十四岁的老人，花白头发，八字胡，仪态庄重，谈吐稳健。我坐在他的床上。对面的墙上有两幅花卉彩画。在一张方桌上，摆着两盆鲜花，他告诉我一盆是“樱桃翠竹”，一盆是“绿叶红豆”。
    在这幽静舒畅的气氛中，牛子恒老人兴致勃勃地向我介绍了养老院的生活。“我们的生活是幸福的。吃的都是细粮，猪肉、鸡、鱼经常不断。一星期还要吃两顿饺子、一顿包子。服装鞋袜等都由国家供给。”我仔细一打听，原来国家规定每月每个养老人员的开支是二十七元。伙食每月是十六元，零花钱五元，剩下的六元是做被服用的，每个人一年的被服费用一共是七十二元。
    牛子恒老人说：“国家对我们照顾得十分周到。可是，——他望着我笑了笑——上年岁的人，也像小孩一样，闲不住；院里有二十亩菜地，都是雇人侍弄，我们不少人也自愿参加做点活。我们做活不白做，菜吃不完就得卖，卖的钱大家分，不干活的光吃菜不分钱。你看，我们的生活该多自在呀！这若是在旧社会，我们这些人至少也死了一半了。你想想，我们怎么不感谢毛主席！”
    接着，牛子恒老人向我述说了他的几十年的矿工生活。他说：“我是河北人，年青时候家里穷得没有办法，二十岁那年就‘闯关东’。先到通化煤矿，又到本溪煤矿；后来到千金寨矿，就是现在的抚顺，在这里一直干了二十多年。当初我上煤矿的时候，若和现在比，那真是天上地下呀！
    “那是10月间，我被把头招到本溪当矿工。人家不把咱当人，叫咱‘煤黑子’，上厕所都得结伙去，有人拿镐把看着，怕跑了。若论劳动条件，就更没法提了。头一次，我被派到‘水掌子’，澕澕的流水，腿都泡白了，得了骨节痛病。后来，又派我到一个‘火掌子’里去，里头热的呀，贴一张饼过二十分钟就能吃熟的。我又得了‘火朦眼’。后来又到‘瓦斯掌子’，那就更受罪了。那有现在这样的劳动保护用品？发胶鞋、手套、口罩、作业服，还吃保健饭。那时候，只给一双布鞋，还是‘礼拜鞋’，作价可比市面上贵一倍。那里还有矿灯啊？摸黑往掌子里走，只带一个橡子面窝头，渴了就得喝矿井里流出的水，唉，煤渣不知喝了多少！干活是干十二小时，若是加班加点就不知多少小时了。”
    他停了一停，继续抑郁地说下去：“若论受苦，咱穷哥们还能挺，可是得了病就挺不下去了。想歇歇吧，不行，给日本人看见就是劈头盖脑的一顿棒子，打得昏头昏脑还得给人家干！唉，吃不饱，穿不暖，累得要死，怎么能有心思干呢！有些人病得厉害了，眼看着还有口气，鬼子、把头却拉出来就往停尸房子送。那里头每天都要送进去一批，有的还没有断气就被大车给拉出去，像野狗一样，赤条条地扔在大坑里……。”
    牛子恒老人的眼角有些发湿，我们的谈话停了下来。这时候，窗外阳光充沛，扩音器正在播送京戏“借东风”。牛子恒老人喝了一口茶，拉起话头接着说：
    “同志，你还年青，没见过那种世道。可是，你总该听说过吧！哪个煤矿没有‘万人坑’！日本鬼子没把咱当人，他们说：‘死了死了的好，中国人大大的有！’同志，你听听，这是什么话？谁能想到有今天？唉——老人又顿住了自己的话，过了一会儿才无限感慨地说——年青力壮的身体，净给日本强盗折磨了。没能为新社会做多少事，今天的生活，我受之有愧呀！假如我年青四十年该多好啊！……青年同志们，好好为新社会多贡献一分力量吧！”
    幸福的晚年
    老人们在这里舒适地生活着，受到各方面亲切的关怀。每逢年节，阜新的市委书记、矿务局长、工会主席总要来向老人们慰问。有一次，阜新矿务局的一位局长建议老人们展开“长寿竞赛”，老人们很感兴趣。七十六岁的老人孙宝林提起这事非常兴奋。他说：“我要活一百二十岁，看看共产主义社会！”
    孙宝林是一位乐观主义的老人，银白色的头发，留着一绺短胡；虽然牙齿已经掉光了，面孔仍是很红润。据说，为了给这位老人镶牙，院长曾找他“动员”了好几次，可是老人还是不干。他说：“给国家省几个钱吧，我没牙照样吃饭。”院长告诉我，1952年这位老人乍一来的时候，整天咳嗽、吐痰，身体异常衰弱。经过几年的休养，精神一年比一年好。现在已经不再吐痰，咳嗽也早就好了。每天天不亮他就起来散步，生活很规律。据说这是在履行“竞赛”计划呢。
    这位老人当年由于不甘忍受日本人的压迫，曾经拿起棒子把一个日本把头的脑袋打破了。当时他自己也受了伤，如今额头还留着伤痕。在敌伪统治时代，敢于拿起木棒打伤日本把头，这是多强烈的反抗啊！当我与这位老人谈话的时候，日本正有三百万工人用罢工的行动要求增加工资，日本矿工会所属十四家大公司在全国五十二个矿山的十六万工会会员，也采取了七十二小时的全面罢工行动。在这个有着美丽的富士山的国度里，工人们也正在觉醒了！
    孙宝林老人告诉我，曾经有一个日本的代表团来到养老院，他们拿着画报，找到照片上的白胡子老人见了面。那位老人告诉他们：“咱们中国的工人阶级已经当了家，我们才有今天的生活。我愿意日本的老矿工们，也能有这样好的环境来度过他们的晚年。”
    归来的路上，孙宝林老人的话，使我久久不能忘怀。让世界上所有的劳动者都有这样幸福的晚年吧！
