Respect Medical Personnel
By a Commentator from this Newspaper

In the people's hospitals, doctors and nurses "heal the wounded, rescue the dying, and promote revolutionary humanitarianism," observing patients' conditions day and night, and doing their best to treat and care for them, so that patients can recover their health and return to their productive posts. Their labor should be respected. However, they are sometimes arbitrarily beaten and insulted by patients and their family members, especially by some cadres of government organs who are hospitalized due to illness. Although this phenomenon is rare, its impact is significant, causing medical personnel severe mental distress and creating a negative influence in society. This is detrimental to the people's medical work and should be taken seriously and eliminated.

The occurrence of this phenomenon is due, on the one hand, to the fact that some people indeed have the privileged thinking of the rulers of the old society towards laborers, regarding noble comradeship as a vulgar money relationship, believing that since they have paid money, their demands should be met, and they can arbitrarily beat and insult others if they are not satisfied; on the other hand, it is also due to the lack of a correct understanding of the work of medical personnel by some people. Therefore, it is necessary to create a social atmosphere against the remnants of old ideas, so that people have a correct understanding of the work of medical personnel and respect the labor of medical personnel.

People know that the Chinese people have always respected medical personnel. The ancients said, "Medicine is a benevolent art." Today, people regard doctors as relatives, and patients and doctors become close friends. Patients respect medical personnel, and medical personnel care for patients, and the two sides cooperate closely, leaving behind touching friendships. This is not only because the work of medical personnel is to treat diseases and save people, demonstrating noble humanitarian qualities, but also because the profession engaged in by medical personnel has become a part of the Party's cause. The work of medical personnel is a division of labor in society, and their relationship with patients is a comrade relationship. That deep comradely friendship is the main aspect of today's relationship between people and medical personnel. Abandoning this aspect cannot explain the relationship between people and medical personnel today. We should maintain and promote the spirit of friendship between patients and medical personnel, and require patients to abide by hospital rules and diagnosis and treatment systems, listen to doctors and nurses, and cooperate with doctors and nurses.

As for the shortcomings and mistakes of medical personnel, they cannot be a reason to despise the profession of medical personnel or to belittle medical personnel, because today's medical personnel are state workers, and they have the mission of protecting the people's health and lives. Precisely because of this, the requirements for them are high. Generally speaking, today's medical personnel have a high sense of responsibility and compassion. However, they may have shortcomings and errors in their work, and criticizing them is only to educate them to correct these shortcomings and errors in a timely manner, and to educate them to improve work systems and improve medical technology and medical quality. People can recall that in the old society, no one knows how many people died from ineffective treatment or delayed treatment, and people generally attributed it to "fate." Now, not only can people with serious illnesses receive treatment, but even common minor illnesses and chronic diseases have opportunities for treatment and recuperation. However, we must recognize that although today's medical science has reached a relatively high level, it cannot cure all diseases, and there are still many diseases that are difficult to cure; although the number of medical personnel today has increased many times compared with before liberation, it still cannot meet the people's medical needs; and although the technical level of today's medical personnel has also greatly improved, it is still impossible to reach a completely ideal level. People should understand, and only after understanding these situations, can they realistically treat the contradiction between today's medical forces and objective needs. People should also think of the situation where many medical personnel are excessively stressed and overworked, and have the responsibility to work with medical personnel to overcome the current difficulties.

Incidents of beating and insulting medical personnel should be dealt with seriously. Some people believe that the unreasonable behavior of patients can be forgiven; or that it is impossible to deal with it, so they have to let it go, causing this phenomenon to occur repeatedly and the impact to become increasingly worse. It should be said that this indulgent attitude is wrong. The Constitution stipulates that human rights are protected from infringement. Can patients arbitrarily beat and insult medical personnel? In particular, a revolutionary cadre must not lose the moral character of a revolutionary cadre at any time or place, and cannot be special just because they are sick. Eliminating the behavior of beating and insulting medical personnel and protecting the enthusiasm of medical personnel is also for the sake of patients. One cannot emphasize any objective reasons and tolerate this violent and unreasonable behavior. This behavior should be exposed and condemned by public opinion. The Party and Communist Youth League organizations in the patient's work unit should care about patients living in the hospital, comfort and educate them, and not let them go unmanaged or simply appease them. In order to uphold national laws and discipline, those who infringe on the human rights of medical personnel should be given necessary legal sanctions.

Hospital administrative leaders should educate medical personnel to strive to continuously improve their technical and political levels, care for patients more kindly, strive to improve relations with patients, and strive for better results in medical treatment. At the same time, they should also strengthen the education of hospitalized and outpatient patients, educate patients to abide by hospital rules, follow the guidance of doctors, etc.

Efforts should be made from all aspects to eliminate the abnormal factors in the relationship between patients and medical personnel, so that medical personnel can devote themselves to the work of treating diseases and saving people without worries and happily.

    尊重医务人员
    本报评论员
    在人民的医院里，医生护士“救死扶伤，发扬革命的人道主义精神”，夜以继日地观察病情，尽心竭力治疗护理，使病人恢复健康，重新走向生产岗位。他们的劳动应当受到尊重。可是，他们有时却受到病人和病人家属的任意殴打和侮辱，特别是受到一些因病住院的机关干部的殴打和侮辱。这种现象虽然是少数的，但影响却很大，给予医务人员严重的精神上的不愉快，并且在社会上产生不良的影响。这对于人民的医疗工作是不利的，应该引起人们的重视，并消灭它。
    这种现象的发生，一方面是由于一些人确实有旧社会统治者对待劳动者的那种特权思想，把高贵的同志友爱当成庸俗的金钱关系，认为他出了钱，他的要求就应当得到满足，一旦不顺他的心意，就可以任意殴打侮辱别人；另一方面也由于一些人对医务人员的工作缺乏正确的认识。因此，有必要在社会上形成反对旧思想余毒的风气，使人们对医务人员的工作有正确的了解，尊敬医务人员的劳动。
    人们知道，我国人民一向是尊敬医务人员的，古人说，“医者仁术也”。今天，人们把医生看作亲人，病人和医生成为挚友。病人尊敬医务人员，医务人员爱护病人，双方亲密合作，留下了动人的情谊。这不仅因为医务人员的工作是治病救人，表现了高尚的人道主义品德；而且因为医务人员所从事的职业，已成为党的事业的一部分。医务人员的工作是社会的分工，他们和病人的关系是同志的关系。那种深情厚谊的同志友爱，是今天人们同医务人员之间关系的主要方面，抛弃这方面是不能说明今天人们与医务人员之间的关系的。我们应当保持和发扬病人同医务人员之间的友爱精神，要求病人遵守医院规则和诊疗制度，听医生护士的话，同医生护士合作。
    至于医务人员的缺点和过失，也不能成为鄙薄医务人员的职业、轻视医务人员的理由，因为今天的医务人员是国家工作人员，他们负有保护人民的健康和生命的使命。正因为这样，对他们的要求是高的。一般地说，今天的医务人员是有高度责任心和同情心的。但他们在工作中可能有缺点和错误，批评他们只是为了教育他们及时纠正这些缺点和错误，教育他们改进工作制度和提高医疗技术水平和医疗质量。人们可以回想一下，在旧社会里，治疗无效而死者或延误治疗时机而死者，不知多少，人们一般只能委之于“命运”。现在，不仅一般人有了严重的病症可以得到治疗，就是一般的轻病和慢性病也有了治疗和疗养的机会。但是，我们应当认识到：今天医学科学虽然达到了相当高的水平，但还不能把所有的病都治好，仍有不少难以治好的病症；今天的医务人员数量虽然比解放前增加了许多倍，但仍不能满足人民医疗的需要；今天医务人员的技术水平也有很大提高，但还不可能达到完全理想的程度。人们应当了解并且也只有了解了这些情况以后，才能实事求是地对待今天的医疗力量和客观需要的矛盾。人们也应该想到许多医务人员过度紧张劳累的情况，有责任和医务人员共同来克服当前的困难。
    对于殴打和侮辱医务人员的事件，应该严肃处理。有人认为病人的无理行为是可以原谅的；或者无法处理，只好听之任之，使这种现象一再发生，影响愈来愈坏。应该说，这种放纵态度是不对的。宪法规定保障人权不受侵犯，难道病人就可以任意殴打和侮辱医务人员吗？特别是一个革命干部，无论在何时何地都不能失掉革命干部的道德品质，不能因为生病就可以特殊化。杜绝殴打和侮辱医务人员的行为，保护医务人员的积极性，也正是为了病人着想。不能强调任何客观原因，容忍这种横暴无理的行为。要把这种行为揭露出来，让它受到社会舆论的谴责。病人所在单位的党和团的组织，要关心住在医院的病人，对他们进行安慰和教育，不能放任不管或一味迁就。为了严肃国家法纪，对于那些侵犯医务人员人权的人，应该给以必要的法律制裁。
    医院行政领导方面，应当教育医务人员努力不断提高技术水平和政治水平，更亲切地关心病人，努力改进同病人的关系，在医疗上争取更好的效果。同时，也应当加强对住院和门诊病人的教育工作，教育病人遵守院规，听从医生的指导，等等。
    从各方面努力消除造成病人和医务人员关系中那种不正常的因素，使医务人员能无所顾虑地、愉快地致力于治病救人的工作。
