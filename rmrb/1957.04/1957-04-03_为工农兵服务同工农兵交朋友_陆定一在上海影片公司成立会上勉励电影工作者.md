Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 2nd. The Shanghai Film Studio was established on April 1st. More than a thousand film scriptwriters, directors, actors, and film workers gathered to celebrate the beginning of this new reform in the film industry.

    Lu Dingyi, Director of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the inaugural meeting of the factories and troupes affiliated with the Shanghai Film Studio. He said: Shanghai was the center of China's film industry before liberation. Therefore, it is entirely understandable that Shanghai's film workers raise the issue of the tradition of Chinese cinema. Although the history of Chinese cinema is not long, it has a fairly good tradition. Before liberation, the left-wing film industry represented this good tradition. Left-wing films had many good things, such as anti-imperialist and anti-feudal ideas and a spirit of hard struggle. At that time, some film cadres were also trained. Under very bad conditions, they fought the reactionary forces unyieldingly and were able to produce many good films with little money. Within the left-wing film industry, ideologically speaking, there was also a distinction between Marxism and non-Marxism. The film industry after liberation was developed by relying on the cadres trained by the left-wing film industry.

    When talking about the assessment of the film industry after liberation, Lu Dingyi believed that the film industry after liberation was a socialist film industry under the people's political power serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, which was fundamentally different from the film industry under reactionary rule in the past. The film industry has made great achievements after liberation. The workers, peasants, and soldiers appeared on the screen as masters of the country, and openly promoted the truth of revolution and the truth of socialism. However, during a certain period, some leading comrades in the film industry became arrogant due to their work achievements, and thus committed more serious mistakes of dogmatism and sectarianism; but in the past three years, this error has been opposed and is being gradually overcome. When Lu Dingyi spoke about film workers' long-term efforts to integrate with the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serve them, he pointed out that the reasons for the creation of things that express bourgeois ideas and the production of formulaic and conceptual works are due to unfamiliarity with the lives of the workers, peasants, and soldiers and a lack of close friends among them. He pointed out that film workers are people who educate others. They must not only study Marxism in books, but also in practice, that is, to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers wholeheartedly and form close friends with them. He encouraged film workers to make long-term and patient efforts for this.

    Wang Lanxi, Director of the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture, spoke at the meeting about the characteristics of film art and the measures taken by the film leadership to improve the film industry. He hoped that the Shanghai Film Studio, which has more creative personnel, would create more and better films.

    Cao Diqiu, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, also attended the meeting to congratulate and speak.

    为工农兵服务同工农兵交朋友
    陆定一在上海影片公司成立会上勉励电影工作者
    新华社上海2日电　上海电影制片公司1日成立。全市一千多个电影编剧、导演、演员和电影工作者欢聚一堂，庆祝电影事业上这一新的改革的开始。
    中共中央宣传部部长陆定一在上海电影制片公司所属各厂、团成立大会上讲了话，他说：上海在解放以前是我国电影事业的中心，因此，上海的电影工作者提出中国电影的传统问题是完全可以理解的。中国电影事业历史虽然不长，但有相当好的传统。在解放前，代表这种好传统的，是左翼的电影事业。左翼电影有许多好的东西，如反帝、反封建的思想和刻苦奋斗的事业精神。当时也培养了一些电影干部，他们在很坏的条件下，坚强不屈地同反动势力斗争，能够花不多的钱拍制不少好的影片。左翼电影事业内部，在思想上说，又有马克思主义与非马克思主义之分。解放后的电影事业是依靠左翼电影事业所培养的干部发展起来的。
    陆定一谈到对解放后电影事业的估计时，认为解放后的电影事业是在人民政权下面的社会主义的为工农兵服务的电影事业，这同过去反动统治下的电影事业根本不同。解放后电影事业成绩很大。工农兵以国家主人翁的面貌出现在银幕上，并公开宣传革命的道理、社会主义的道理。但是，在有一段时期中部分电影领导同志由于工作有成绩而产生了骄傲情绪，因而犯了比较严重的教条主义、宗派主义的错误；但三年以来，这种错误遭到了反对，并在逐步克服中。陆定一在说到电影工作者应作长期努力，与工农兵结合为工农兵服务时，指出了创作中表现资产阶级思想的东西和产生公式化概念化的作品的原因，是由于对工农兵的生活不熟悉，缺乏工农兵的知心朋友。他指出电影工作者是教育别人的人，自己不但在书本上，并且要在实践中学习马克思主义，这就是要全心全意为工农兵服务，同工农兵结成知心朋友。他勉励电影工作者为此作长期的耐心的努力。
    文化部电影事业管理局局长王兰西在会上谈了电影艺术的特点和电影领导上对改进电影事业的措施。他希望拥有较多创作人员的上海电影制片公司，创作出更多、更好的影片。
    中共上海市委书记、上海市副市长曹荻秋也到会祝贺并讲了话。
