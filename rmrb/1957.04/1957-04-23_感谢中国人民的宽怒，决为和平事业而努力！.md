    Thanking the Chinese People for Their Forgiveness, Determined to Work for the Cause of Peace!
    Editor's Note: Kuniyoshi Shuntaro is a former Japanese soldier who committed war crimes during the war of aggression against China. Last summer, he was released and returned to his country after being leniently treated by our government. This is a letter of gratitude he wrote to the Chinese people after returning home, expressing his determination to work for peace and improve Sino-Japanese relations.

Dear Chinese Comrades:

    It has been more than half a year since we returned to our homeland, Japan, last summer with the forgiveness of the Chinese people. Stepping on the soil of our homeland after ten years of separation, and being able to meet our long-missed wives and brothers, our gratitude to the Chinese people cannot be expressed in words! How happy our relatives were to see us return safely and in good health, and how grateful they were for the generosity and humanitarianism of the Chinese people!

    In this regard, we cannot help but think of how much the Chinese people, whose loved ones were taken away by Japanese militarists, resented the past; how sad they were when they waited in vain for those loved ones who would never return! Thinking of this, we cannot help but express our deepest gratitude again for your great love of peace and the humanitarian spirit of repaying evil with good.

    We immediately began rebuilding our lives at the starting point of a new life. It is by no means easy to live a stable life in Japan today. The Japanese government only formally expresses its willingness to help us. Capitalists are also unwilling to hire us, middle-aged returnees who lack skills. Therefore, we have all united to launch an employment campaign. As a result, after half a year, about 50% of us have returned to our old jobs or found new ones. About 30% of us have returned to our homes to engage in agriculture and commerce. Our income is small, and life is difficult, but we have not bowed our heads to these difficulties. The joy of reunion with our families and the bright hope for the future have greatly encouraged us. The younger ones have married and started happy lives. Within these six months, 150 of us have gotten married.

    While we are busy rebuilding our lives, we have never forgotten the social activities to strive for peace. We have all worked together to hold literary gatherings in Tokyo to commemorate our return, performed at "Peace Song" gatherings, and published handwritten notes in China exposing the crimes of the war of aggression. Most of us have joined the Japan-China Friendship Association to work to improve Sino-Japanese relations.

    Our strength is small, but our desire for peace and the promotion of Sino-Japanese friendship is growing stronger and stronger. We will join hands with people who hope for peace and are willing to promote Sino-Japanese friendship and move forward together!

    Finally, I sincerely wish the Chinese people greater victories in the socialist construction of their great motherland!

                                            Kuniyoshi Shuntaro
                                 April 5, 1957

    感谢中国人民的宽怒，决为和平事业而努力！
    编者按：国友俊太郎是前日本军士兵，在侵略中国战争中犯有战争罪行，去年夏天经我国政府宽大处理，被释放回国。这是他回国后给中国人民写来的感谢信，他表示要为和平和改进中日关系而努力。亲爱的中国诸君：
    去年夏天，得到中国人民的宽恕，我们回到了祖国——日本，到现在已经有半年多了。我们踏上离别十年的祖国土地，能和长时怀念着的妻子、兄弟会面，我们对中国人民感激的心情是不能用言语来形容的！迎接我们的亲属看到我们平安归来，身体健康，是多么高兴啊，对中国人民的宽大和人道精神是多末感激啊！
    对此，我们不能不想到：被日本军国主义者夺走亲骨肉的中国人民，是如何地怨恨过去；他们徒然地等待那些不会再回来的亲人的时候，是多末伤心！想到这里，对于你们以德报怨的伟大的热爱和平和人类的胸怀，我们不禁要再次表示深深的谢意。
    我们在新的人生的起点上立即开始了生活的重建。现在在日本要想过安定的生活，决不是一件容易的事。日本政府只不过在形式上表示要给我们帮助。资本家也不愿意雇用我们这些回国的缺乏技术的中年人。所以，我们大家同心合力地展开了就业运动。结果，经过半年之后，现在约有50％的人恢复了旧职或找到了新工作。约有30％的人，回到自己的家里从事农业和从事商业。我们的收入很少，生活是困难的，但我们并没有向这些困难低头。和家属的欢乐团聚以及对于未来的明朗的希望，大大地鼓舞了我们。比较年轻的人结了婚，开始了愉快的生活。在这半年之内，我们当中有一百五十人结了婚。
    在繁忙的重新建立我们的生活的同时，我们决没有忘记争取和平的社会活动。大家同心协力地在东京举办过纪念回国的文艺性集会，也在“和平歌声”的集会上演出过，此外发行了在中国的手记，揭露了侵略战争的罪恶。我们大部分人都加入了日中友好协会，要为改善日中关系而努力。
    我们的力量很小，但是我们要求和平和促进日中友好的愿望，却日益高涨，我们将同希望和平和愿意促进日中友好的人们携起手来，一同前进！
    最后，衷心祝福中国人民在自己伟大的祖国的社会主义建设事业中取得更大的胜利！
                                            国友俊太郎
                                 1957年4月5日
