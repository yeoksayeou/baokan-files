    The First National Taoist Organization
    China Taoist Association Established
    Xinhua News Agency, 12th - The China Taoist Association was officially established in Beijing today. This is the first widely representative national Taoist organization in the more than two-thousand-year history of Taoism in China.
    The inaugural meeting began on the 8th. At today's meeting, the charter of the China Taoist Association was adopted. This charter requires the China Taoist Association to connect and unite Taoists nationwide, inherit and promote the excellent traditions of Taoism, and, under the leadership of the People's Government, love the motherland, actively support the country's socialist construction, participate in the movement to defend world peace, and assist the government in implementing the policy of freedom of religious belief. The Taoist Association will use this as its guiding principle for future activities.
    The meeting elected sixty-one directors to form the first council of the China Taoist Association. The meeting also passed the resolution of the inaugural meeting of the China Taoist Association and a letter of tribute to Chairman Mao Zedong.
    During the meeting, the representatives listened to the work report by Yue Chongdai, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the China Taoist Association, on initiating and preparing for the establishment of the China Taoist Association, and the explanation on the draft charter of the China Taoist Association by Vice Chairman Meng Minghui. The meeting also invited Qi Yanming, Deputy Secretary-General of the State Council, to give a report on current affairs, and He Chengxiang, Director of the Religious Affairs Bureau of the State Council, to give a report on the policy of freedom of religious belief. The representatives fully discussed these reports in group meetings and plenary sessions.
    Ninety-two representatives attended the meeting, some of whom were well-known Taoists from places such as Mount Hua, Mount Song, and Mount Tai.
    After today's meeting, the Taoists held a religious ceremony, burning incense and lighting candles, and bowing to the image of Lao Tzu, the founder of Taoism.
    Taoism is a religion that has been circulating among the Han Chinese people in China for more than two thousand years. The doctrines of Taoism originated with Lao Tzu and only took shape as a religion during the Eastern Han Dynasty.

    成立会议从8日开始举行。在今天的会议上通过了中国道教协会章程，这个章程要求中国道教协会要联系和团结全国道教徒，继承和发扬道教优良传统；并在人民政府领导下，爱护祖国，积极支持国家的社会主义建设，参加保卫世界和平运动，协助政府贯彻宗教信仰自由政策。道教协会以此作为它今后活动的宗旨。
    会议选出中国道教协会理事六十一人组成第一届理事会。会议还通过了中国道教协会成立会议的决议以及给毛泽东主席的致敬信。
    会议期间，代表们听了中国道教协会筹备委员会主任委员岳崇岱作的关于发起和筹备成立中国道教协会的工作报告、副主任委员孟明慧作的关于中国道教协会章程草案的说明。会议还邀请国务院副秘书长齐燕铭作了时事报告和国务院宗教事务局局长何成湘作关于宗教信仰自由政策的报告。代表们在小组会和大会上充分地讨论了这些报告。
    参加这次会议的有九十二位代表，其中有些代表是从华山、嵩山、泰山等地来的知名道士。
    在今天会议结束后，道教徒们举行了宗教仪式，焚香亮烛，向道教始祖老子画像稽首。
    道教是流传在中国汉民族中的宗教，有两千多年的历史。道教的学说创始于老子，到东汉时才形成为宗教。
