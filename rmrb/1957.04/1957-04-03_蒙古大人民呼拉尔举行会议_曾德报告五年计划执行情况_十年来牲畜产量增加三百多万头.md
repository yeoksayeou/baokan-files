Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, April 2nd - The Fourth Session of the Second Great People's Hural of the Mongolian People's Republic was held in Ulaanbaatar today.

Tsend, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Mongolia and Chairman of the State Planning Commission, delivered a report at the meeting on the implementation of the first four years of the Second Five-Year Plan (1953-1957) and the construction plan for 1957. He said that in the fourth year of the Second Five-Year Plan, Mongolia's livestock increased by more than 3.4 million head compared to 1947; industrial production roughly doubled; and the number of students enrolled increased by more than 30,000. He said that industrial production had already exceeded the Second Five-Year Plan target one year ahead of schedule; and the agricultural planting area increased by more than 30,000 hectares compared to 1952.

Tsend also spoke about the achievements made in transportation, culture, education, and health. He said that there are now more than 99,000 workers and staff members nationwide, and the wage fund for workers and staff members has increased by more than 73% in the past four years, while the income of herdsmen has increased by 57%.

When talking about the construction plan for 1957, Tsend said that Mongolia's livestock will increase to more than 25 million head this year, and the grain planting area will increase to more than 99,000 hectares. He said that the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal countries will help Mongolia build dozens of construction projects. After the completion of this year's construction plan, many construction projects will exceed the Five-Year Plan target.

Tsend said that Mongolia has made great achievements in strengthening relations with the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries, and has established diplomatic relations with countries such as India, Burma, Indonesia, and Yugoslavia. Despite the United States' obstruction of Mongolia's entry into the United Nations, an independent and autonomous Mongolia will eventually obtain its legitimate seat in the United Nations.

Subsequently, Mongolian Minister of Finance Molomjamts made a report on the 1955 final accounts and the 1957 draft budget.

    新华社乌兰巴托2日电　蒙古人民共和国第二届大人民呼拉尔第四次会议今天在乌兰巴托举行。
    蒙古部长会议副主席兼国家计划委员会主席曾德在会上作了关于第二个五年计划（1953年—1957年）前四年的执行情况和1957年建设计划的报告。他说，在第二个五年计划的第四年，蒙古的牲畜比1947年增加了三百四十多万头；工业生产量大约增加了两倍；就学人数增加了三万多人。他说，工业生产量已经提前一年超额完成了第二个五年计划；农业播种面积比1952年增加了三万多公顷。
    曾德还谈到在运输、文教、卫生等方面取得的成就。他说，现在全国有职工九万九千多人，四年来职工的工资基金增加了73％以上，牧民收入增加了57％。
    曾德在谈到1957年的建设计划时说，蒙古的牲畜今年将增殖到二千五百多万头，谷物播种面积将增加到九万九千多公顷。他说，苏联、中国和其他兄弟国家将帮助蒙古兴建几十项建设工程。今年的建设计划完成以后，很多建设项目将超额完成五年计划。
    曾德说，蒙古在加强同苏联、中国以及其他社会主义国家间的关系方面有了很大的成就，并且和印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚、南斯拉夫等国家建立了外交关系。尽管美国阻挠蒙古进入联合国，但是独立自主的蒙古终将获得它在联合国的合法席位。
