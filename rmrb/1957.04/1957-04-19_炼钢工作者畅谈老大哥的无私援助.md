Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 18th. Xinhua News Agency reporter He Changhua reports: Ten Soviet experts are participating in the National Steelmaking Conference currently being held in Shanghai. In recent days, this reporter interviewed steelworkers from all over the country, and they all gratefully spoke of the enormous role that Soviet experts and advanced Soviet experience have played in improving China's steelmaking level.

The Vice Minister of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, Liu Bin, said: "From 1952 to 1956, China's steel production increased at a high average annual rate of 33.9%. One of the main reasons for the rapid improvement in steelmaking levels is the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and our consistent adherence to learning from the Soviet Union." Liu Bin said, "Take this National Steelmaking Conference as an example, ten Soviet experts are participating, two of whom were specially sent by the Soviet Ministry of Ferrous Metallurgy. The reports made by the experts to the conference will have a good effect on further improving China's steelmaking level in the future."

Xiao Mingwei, Director of the Ferrous Metallurgy Department of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, told reporters: "Chinese open-hearth steelmaking workers have universally learned and applied the Soviet experience of rapid steelmaking. The rapid steelmaking competition has become the main content of socialist competition among Chinese open-hearth steelmaking workers, and as a result, more than 200,000 tons of steel were produced last year than the year before." He also said, "The Soviet Union's advanced experience in thick-layer sintering of open-hearth furnace bottoms and rapid cold repairs, which has been universally adopted in China, has increased the operating rate of China's open-hearth furnaces from 68.1% in 1952 to 85.5% last year; and every 1% increase in the operating rate is equivalent to producing tens of thousands of tons of steel."

Ma Chengde, Chief Steelmaker of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, told reporters: "If we were to calculate the role played by Soviet experts in Anshan Iron and Steel, it would be a very vast undertaking, but just one example is enough to illustrate it. With the help of Soviet experts, we changed the old steelmaking methods left over from the enemy and puppet period, and we converted the original seven preliminary refining furnaces into seven large open-hearth furnaces, which are directly used to smelt finished steel, which greatly increased steel production." Ma Chengde also said, "Under the suggestions and help of Soviet experts, the Anshan Iron and Steel steelmaking department had already adopted Soviet technical operating procedures, established a set of thermal engineering systems, and increased the charging volume of open-hearth furnaces. Soviet experts have also helped Anshan Iron and Steel cultivate a group of professional and technical personnel in various aspects of steelmaking with a certain level of expertise."

Bi Kezhen, Chief Engineer of a special steel plant, said: "After Soviet experts provided guidance by the furnace, or used Soviet data, the variety of steel produced by our factory has increased from about 100 kinds in 1953 to more than 200 kinds now. We have successfully smelted heat-resistant alloys for manufacturing jet aircraft, heat-resistant stainless steel for the chemical industry and machine manufacturing industry, and high-grade steel types such as ball bearing steel; among them, the successful smelting of heat-resistant alloy steel in particular marks an extremely important step forward in China's steelmaking technology."

Vice Minister of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry Liu Bin added in conclusion: "Learning from the Soviet Union is still the firm and unwavering policy of Chinese steelworkers in the future. This year, under the central government's call for increasing production and practicing economy, Chinese steelworkers will widely carry out technical and scientific activities, further learn from the Soviet Union, in order to achieve the goal of saving raw materials, increasing steel production, increasing the variety of steel, and improving the quality of steel."

    炼钢工作者畅谈老大哥的无私援助
    据新华社上海18日电　新华社记者贺昌华报道：有十位苏联专家参加了正在上海举行的全国炼钢会议。连日来，记者访问了来自各地的我国炼钢工作者，他们都感激地谈到苏联专家和苏联先进经验对我国提高炼钢水平所起的巨大作用。
    冶金工业部副部长刘彬说：“从1952年到1956年，我国钢的产量每年平均以33.9％的高速度增长。炼钢水平迅速提高的主要原因之一，是苏联无私的援助和我们一贯坚持地学习苏联。”刘彬说，“拿这次全国炼钢会议来说，有十位苏联专家参加，其中有两位是苏联黑色冶金工业部特地派来的代表。专家们向会议所作的报告，对我国今后进一步提高炼钢水平将起良好的作用。”
    冶金工业部黑色冶金处处长萧明伟向记者说：“我国平炉炼钢职工已经普遍学习和运用了苏联快速炼钢的经验。快速炼钢竞赛已经成为我国平炉炼钢职工社会主义竞赛的主要内容，因而去年比前年多炼了二十多万吨钢。”他又说，“苏联的平炉炉底厚层烧结法和快速冷修先进经验，在我国普遍采用的结果，使我国平炉的作业率由1952年的68.1％提高到去年的85.5％；而作业率每提高1％，就等于多产几万吨钢。”
    鞍山钢铁公司总炼钢师马成德告诉记者：“如果要计算一下苏联专家对鞍钢所起的作用，这是一件很浩繁的工作，只要举一个例子就足以说明。在苏联专家的帮助下，我们改变了敌伪时期遗留下来的旧的炼钢方法，我们把七座原来的预备精炼炉改成了七座大型平炉，直接用来冶炼成品钢，这就大大增加了钢的产量。”马成德又说，“在苏联专家的建议和帮助下，鞍钢炼钢部门早已采用了苏联的技术操作规程，建立起一套热工制度和增加了平炉的装入量。苏联专家还帮助鞍钢培养了一批具有一定水平的炼钢各方面的专业技术人员。”
    一个特殊钢厂的总工程师毕克桢说：“经过苏联专家在炉子旁边指导，或者运用苏联资料，我厂钢的品种已经由1953年的约一百种增加到现在的二百多种。我们已经冶炼成功了制造喷气式飞机用的耐热合金、化学工业和机器制造工业用的耐热不锈钢、滚珠轴承钢等高级钢种；其中特别是耐热合金钢的冶炼成功，标志我国炼钢技术向前迈进了极为重要的一步。”
    冶金工业部副部长刘彬最后又补充说：“学习苏联，仍是我国炼钢工作者今后坚定不移的方针。我国炼钢工作者今年在中央增产节约号召下，将广泛地开展技术科学活动，进一步学习苏联，以求达到节约原料、增产钢、增加钢的品种和改善钢的质量的目的。”
