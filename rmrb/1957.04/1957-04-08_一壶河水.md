    A Pot of River Water
    Shou Ru

    On Sunday, just as dawn was breaking, Old Man Liu came knocking on my door with his curved-handle cane, wanting me to join him in visiting the Yongding River water diversion project at Sanjiadian. This had been arranged long ago.

    The old man, with his flowing silver beard, was already over seventy, but still very hale and hearty. Since I moved to this alleyway more than three years ago, the old man has been an outstanding newspaper reading group leader in our neighborhood. The neighbors are as captivated listening to him read the newspaper as they are to Lian Kuoru telling stories. I first heard him read the newspaper last spring. The old man's voice, like the sound of metal and stone, was indeed pleasing to the ear; but even more attractive was his method of reading: after reading each piece of news, he always commented and explained, drawing on a wide range of sources (mostly knowledge from life), which was extremely brilliant, giving me, an intellectual, some Beijing anecdotes I had never heard before. For more than a year since then, I have never missed his newspaper reading lessons.

    At a newspaper reading session a few days ago, Old Man Liu read a passage about bringing the water of the Yongding River into the capital, followed by the following comments and annotations:

    "I grew up in Mayu Village in western Beijing, and grew up drinking the water of the Yongding River. The villagers who lived by the river both loved and feared the river at that time. Whenever there was a rainstorm, no one dared to sleep at night. (Speaking of this, the old man pointed to the child in the arms of a woman next to him.) Back then, when I was as big as this child, I was afraid and snuggled in my mother's arms, listening to the roar of the river. One summer, maybe it was the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, the Yongding River flooded again, and many houses were washed away! That year, I was older, but it was my five-year-old nephew's turn to snuggle in my arms, crying and screaming. I held my nephew and grabbed a door panel, and that's how we escaped with our lives. (The old man paused here, and I could see that his eyes were a little wet. He took a sip of water and continued.) After liberation, it's only been a few years! The People's Government has built the Guanting Reservoir, tamed the Yongding River, and today they are bringing the river water to Beijing! Neighbors..."

    I followed the old man's gaze and looked around at the quiet audience sitting around: dozens of faces in the lamplight listened attentively, and dozens of pairs of eyes stared at Old Man Liu's ruddy face. It was at this newspaper reading session that Old Man Liu and I agreed to visit the Yongding River water diversion project at Sanjiadian.

    Now the old man and I have arrived at Sanjiadian by bus. The old man dragged his cane and ran to the Yongding River as fast as he could. "Ah, Sanjiadian is alive, Sanjiadian is alive!" He paced back and forth on the riverbank, his wrinkled face filled with smiles. He looked at the clear green river water, touched the long canal embankment, and kept asking me, "Where is the barrage? What is the intake gate?..."

    "Let's go, let's go to the street and have a look!" Old Man Liu didn't wait for me to answer, and suddenly walked towards the city street. I followed behind, wondering if the old man was going to visit his old acquaintances from his hometown. Who knew that he went into a small iron shop, bought a tin water pot, and ran back to the intake gate.

    The old man hurriedly opened the lid of the pot, turned the cane upside down, hooked the pot beam with the curved handle, put it into the river, and lifted a pot full of river water. The old man carefully held the water droplets on the side of the pot with his palm. The water droplets, like pearls, sparkled in the palm of his hand. The old man looked at it carefully for a while, and gently rubbed the drop of water with the index finger of his other hand, and said, "Look, the Yongding River has really become clear, without even a bit of sediment!"

    Facing the spring breeze, the old man's silver beard fluttered. He stood by the river, holding the water pot, and muttered to himself, "Emperor Kangxi, I am more fortunate than you: although you named the Yongding River, it is truly 'eternally stable' that I have seen with my own eyes today, but you do not have this blessing!"

    The sun turned over the western hills. I urged him several times before the old man reluctantly left the embankment with this pot of water.

    How crowded the buses are on Sundays! The pot of water that Old Man Liu was carrying splashed in the carriage, wetting the clothes of several passengers. When the conductor saw it, he hurriedly asked, "Old man, is there oil in your pot? Or what? Be careful not to stain the clothes of the comrades!"

    "Where is the oil, it's the water of the Yongding River!" The old man looked at the water spots splashed on others, and said apologetically.

    The passengers in the car were a little strange at first, but after listening to the old man's narration, they forgave him, sympathized with him, and were even moved by his childlike innocence.

    That night, I thought that Old Man Liu must be tired, and the regular newspaper reading session might be suspended once? But not so. At seven o'clock, the lights in Old Man Liu's three north rooms were bright, and they were as full of people as usual. The old man said with a smile: "Today, I will first invite you all to drink a cup of good tea! The tea is Fujian Xiaoye tea at two jiao a package; the water is Yongding River water!"

    一壶河水
    寿儒
    星期天，天刚蒙蒙亮，刘老大爷就拄着他那弯把手杖走来敲我的屋门，要我同他一起到三家店参观永定河引水工程，这原是老早约好了的。
    他老人家，银须飘洒，已经七十开外了，可是还很健朗。自从我搬到这条胡同住，已经三年多了，老人家一直是我们街道上出色的读报组长。街坊们听他读报像听连阔如说书一样入迷。去年春天我第一次听他读报。老人家金石般的嗓音，果然动听；可是更吸引人的，是他的读报方法：每读完一段新闻之后，他总是连批带讲，旁征博引（大都是生活中的知识），极其精采，使我这个知识分子得到了一些从未听说过的京城掌故。从此一年多了，我听他读报一直没有缺过课哩。
    前些天的一次读报会上，刘老大爷读了一段要把永定河水引进首都的消息，接着就作了如下评论和注解：
    “我从小生长在京西麻峪村，是喝永定河水长大的。住在河边上的老乡们，那时候又爱这条河，又怕这条河。每逢暴风雨，晚上谁也不敢睡觉。（说到这里，老大爷指了指旁边一位妇女怀抱的孩子。）想当年，我像这孩子这么大，就害怕地偎在妈妈的怀里，听着河水吼叫。有一年夏天，兴许是民国十七年，永定河又发了大水，多少间房子都被冲跑啦！那年，我岁数大了，可轮着五岁的侄儿偎在我的怀里连哭带叫了。我抱着侄儿抓住一块门板，才算逃活了命。（老大爷说到这里停了停，我看得出他的眼眶有些湿润了，他喝了一口水又说下去。）解放了，这才几年哪！人民政府修了官厅水库，制服了永定河，今天又把河水引进北京来！街坊们……”
    我顺着老人家的目光，巡视一下静悄悄地坐在四周的听众：灯下几十张脸听出了神，几十双眼睛盯着刘老大爷红润的面庞。就在这次读报会上，刘老大爷和我约定了去三家店参观永定河引水工程。
    现在老人家同我乘公共汽车到了三家店了。老人家提拉着手杖，健步如飞地奔到永定河边。“啊，三家店活了，三家店活了！”他在河岸上踱来踱去，起皱纹的脸上堆满了笑。他望着清绿的河水，摸着长长的渠道堤岸，不住声地问我：“哪是拦河闸？哪叫进水闸？……”
    “走，上街去看看！”刘老大爷没等我答话，突然向城街走去了。我跟在后面，心想老人家是不是去看望他故里的老相知呢？谁知他走进一家小铁铺，买了一把白铁皮水壶，又奔回进水闸来。
    老人家赶忙打开壶盖，将手杖倒过头来，用弯把勾着壶梁，放到河里去，提起一壶满满荡荡的河水来。老大爷用手心小心地接住壶帮上的水珠。水滴，就像一颗颗珍珠，闪着亮光，在手心里滚动着。老人家仔细端详了一会，用另一只手的食指，轻轻揉这滴水珠，说：“你瞧，永定河真是变清了，连一点泥沙也没有呀！”
    迎着春风，老人家的银须飞舞着。他提着水壶，伫立在河边，又自言自语地叨念着：“康熙皇帝，我可比你有造化：虽说永定河的名字是你起的，可它真正‘永定’，是我今天亲眼瞧见的，你却没有这个眼福呀！”
    太阳转过西山了。我催促几次，老人家才恋恋不舍地带着这一壶水离开堤岸。
    星期天的公共汽车是多么拥挤呵！刘老大爷提着的那壶水，在车厢里溅溢着，沾湿了几个乘客的衣裳。售票员看见了，忙问：“老大爷，您的壶里盛的是油吗？还是什么？小心别把同志们的衣服弄脏了！”
    “哪是油，是永定河水！”老大爷看着溅在别人身上的水点，有些抱歉地说。
    同车的乘客们开始有点奇怪，后来听了老大爷的叙述，也就原谅他，同情他，甚至被他那赤子般的童心所感动了。
    这天晚上，我想刘老大爷一定疲倦了，照例的读报会也许要停止一次吧？可是不然。七点钟，刘老大爷的三间北屋里灯光辉煌，同往常一样坐满了人。老人家笑着说：“今天我先请诸位喝杯好茶！茶叶，是两角一包的福建小叶；水是永定河水！”（附图片）
