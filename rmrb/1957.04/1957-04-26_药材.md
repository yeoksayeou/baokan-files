    Sichuan Discovers Jiangzhenxiang
    (Our newspaper reports) Last year, Jiangzhenxiang (commonly known as Jiangji Teng Naoke), discovered in the mountains of Chengguan, Dahe, and Ganchang in Nanjiang County, Sichuan Province, was assessed by relevant parties to be of better quality than the Jiangzhenxiang found in Hainan Island.
    Jiangzhenxiang is a precious Chinese medicinal material. It can treat "Jinchuang" (wounds caused by iron tools), stop bleeding, promote tissue regeneration, and regulate Qi. However, in the past, China has mostly relied on imports for this valuable medicinal material. In 1956, after the establishment of the Chinese Medicinal Material Management Department of the county's supply and marketing cooperative, through in-depth investigations and visits to the deep mountains and old forests, and through identification from the medicinal materials sold by farmers, a large quantity of this valuable medicinal material was finally discovered again. According to local medicinal farmers and experienced traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, the reserves of Jiangzhenxiang are very large within Nanjiang. The county's supply and marketing cooperative's Chinese medicinal material management department purchased more than 11,000 jin in the first quarter of this year alone. Currently, Jiangzhenxiang has been sold to Nanchong, Jiangyou, Yingshan, Linshui, Dazhu, Hechuan and other counties within Sichuan Province, as well as Hanzhong and other places in Northwest China.

    Large Yield of Astragalus in Jilin
    (Our newspaper reports) According to the Jilin Daily: A patch of valuable medicinal material, Astragalus (Huangqi), covering about seventy or eighty mu, has been discovered in the Dadeshui and Xiaodeshui areas, more than thirty li from the county seat of Changbai County, Jilin Province. It is estimated that it can produce seventy or eighty thousand jin annually, worth fifty to sixty thousand yuan. This medicinal material is a tonic and can be used to replenish Qi. According to the local medicinal material store, this medicinal material is currently in short supply nationwide. The county has decided to send specialists to manage it and cultivate seeds to facilitate vigorous development in the future.

    四川发现降真香
    本报讯　去年在四川省南江县城关、大河、赶场等大山谷里发现的降真香（俗名降机藤脑壳），经有关方面鉴定，质量比在海南岛发现的降真香还要好。
    降真香，是一种名贵的中药材。它可以治疗金疮（被铁质类的器具打伤的疮伤，就叫金疮），也可以止血生肌，还可以顺气。然而这种名贵的药材，在我国历来大多是依靠国外进口的。1956年，这个县的供销合作社中药材经理部正式建立后，通过深入深山老林调查、访问，并从农民出卖的药材中鉴别，终于又大批的发现了这种名贵的药材。据当地药农和老中医谈，在南江境内，降真香的蕴藏量很大。这个县的供销社中药材经理部，在今年第一季度就收购了一万一千多斤。现在，降真香已远销到四川省内的南充、江油、营山、邻水、大竹、合川等县和大西北地区的汉中等地。　（罗建桂）
    吉林黄芪产量大
    本报讯　据吉林日报报道：在距吉林省长白县县城三十多华里的大德水、小德水一带，发现一片约有七、八十亩的珍贵药材——黄芪（即黄耆）。估计每年可产七、八万斤，价值五、六万元。这种药材是强壮剂，用它可以补气。据当地药材商店介绍，这种药材目前在全国范围内是产不足销的。这个县已经决定派专人经营，培育种籽，以利于今后大力发展。
