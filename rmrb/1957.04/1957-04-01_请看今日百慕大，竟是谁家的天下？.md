    Look at Bermuda Today, Whose World Is It?

    Some British journalists who accompanied the British Prime Minister to cover the Anglo-American summit in Bermuda left with a bellyful of complaints after their trip. It is said that the main purpose of this meeting was to re-establish "Anglo-American solidarity," but the British journalists felt the atmosphere was "a bit unusual" as soon as they landed. Bermuda has been a British colony since the seventeenth century. In 1940, the United States leased an air force base and a naval base on the islands for ninety-nine years. This time, the British journalists discovered: "This British island has now been completely Americanized, and it discriminates only against the British."

    Despite the "protests" of the British journalists, they were required to go through customs and immigration upon arrival; while their American counterparts were as free as if they were back home, exempt from all procedures, with luggage not inspected and even passports not checked.

    The ceremony held upon Eisenhower's arrival made the British journalists even more saddened. Because the honor guard at the head of the welcoming procession was not composed of British soldiers but of U.S. Marines. That is to say, the U.S. garrison openly regarded itself as the master of the island. Therefore, one British journalist angrily asked: If Eisenhower were to visit the British mainland, would the American troops stationed there receive "the same priority"?

    This comedy of American "usurping the host's role" vis-à-vis Britain is now not only being staged in Bermuda in the Atlantic Ocean, but also has new programs being arranged in some British islands in the Pacific Ocean. For example, Britain is preparing to conduct hydrogen bomb tests on Christmas Island, and the U.S. government immediately sent a note to Britain, raising its "claim of sovereignty" over Christmas Island—on the grounds that Americans had collected guano there a hundred years ago.

    It seems that the so-called "Anglo-American solidarity" in the eyes of the United States is actually a simple formula: "What's yours is mine, and what's mine is still mine!" This is probably also a principle of "Eisenhower Doctrine" regarding British colonial interests. (Ping)

### 请看今日百慕大，竟是谁家的天下？

    请看今日百慕大，竟是谁家的天下？
    一些随同英国首相采访美英首脑会议的英国记者，在百慕大跑了一趟之后引起了一肚子牢骚。据说，这个会议的主要目的是重新确立“英美团结”，但英国记者们一上岸就感到气氛“有点不寻常”。百慕大从十七世纪以来就是英国的殖民地，1940年美国租用了群岛上的一个空军基地和一个海军基地，租期九十九年。这回，英国记者们发现：“这个英国岛屿现在已经完全美国化了，它所歧视的只是英国人。”
    尽管英国记者提出了“抗议”，他们到达后就被规定要到海关和移民局去办入境手续；而他们的美国同行却像回到自己家里那样自由自在，可以免除一切手续，行李不需要检查，连护照也不查看。
    艾森豪威尔到达时举行的仪式，使英国记者们更感到伤心。因为欢迎行列前头的仪仗队，竟不是由英国士兵而是由美国海军陆战队组成的。就是说，美国驻军公然以这个岛屿的主人自居了。因此，一个英国记者气愤愤地发问道：如果艾森豪威尔访问英国本土，驻在那里的美国部队是否也会得到“同样的优先权”？
    美国对英国的这种“喧宾夺主”的喜剧，现在并不只在大西洋上的百慕大上演，而且在太平洋上的某些英属岛屿也安排了新节目。例如，英国正准备在圣诞岛举行氢弹试验，而美国政府马上就向英国提出了照会，提出它对圣诞岛的“主权要求”——理由是一百年前美国人曾在那里取过鸟粪。
    看来，美国眼里的所谓“美英团结”，原来就是这么一个简明的公式：“你的就是我的，我的还是我的！”这大概也是“艾森豪威尔主义”对待英国殖民利益的一个原则。　（平）
