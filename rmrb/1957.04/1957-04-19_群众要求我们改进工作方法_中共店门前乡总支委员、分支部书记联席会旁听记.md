    The Masses Demand That We Improve Our Working Methods
    – A Record of Attending the Joint Meeting of the General Branch Committee and Branch Secretaries of the CCP in Dianmenqian Township
    Since Liu Zuoming, a member of the Hengshan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, concurrently served as the secretary of the general branch of Dianmenqian Township in Hengshan County, Hunan Province, many improvements have been made in guiding production work. These improvements are mainly manifested in: Under the leadership of Liu Zuoming, the work of all township cadres and commune cadres has become more thorough than before. Four-fifths of the time of the fifteen township cadres is spent living in production teams, and each person regularly grasps the ideological situation of five commune members from different classes. While doing their work, the cadres also accumulated twenty dan of manure for military families. In addition to leading production, most of the more than 300 agricultural cooperative cadres in the township also worked for twenty or thirty workdays. After going deeper, they found problems quickly and solved them quickly, and they were willing to consult with the masses, so production was good and the masses supported them. Recently, the CCP Township General Branch Committee and Branch Secretaries held a special meeting to summarize the experience of improving working methods.
    Chen Bingyuan, a member of the General Branch Committee, introduced at the meeting his experience in mobilizing commune members of the Xinqiao Agricultural Cooperative to expand the planting of double-cropping rice. This township cadre, who had served as the secretary of the township branch for two years, saw that Xinqiao Cooperative had a bumper harvest of double-cropping rice last year and that water conservancy had been improved this year. He discussed with the cooperative cadres the idea of expanding the double-cropping rice in the entire cooperative from 121 mu last year to 320 mu. As usual, he held a meeting to announce this to the commune members, and seeing that everyone had no objections at the time, he was convinced that the problem was solved.
    However, when contracting production to the production teams, it was found that the commune members disagreed with changing many fields to double-cropping rice, and only 150 mu agreed to change. In the past, if such problems were discovered, the cooperative cadres would have to work to get the commune members to see things the same way. But this time, Chen Bingyuan repeatedly calculated three accounts with the commune members: increased production and income, improved living, and labor outlets. In the process, he found that some commune members' opinions were reasonable. So, together with the cooperative cadres and experienced farmers, he carried the register to the fields to identify them one by one, removing some fields that were not suitable for double-cropping rice. After more than a month of hard work, the commune members finally agreed to plant 247 mu of double-cropping rice.
    Chen Bingyuan said with great emotion: "The masses' awareness has increased, and you can't take over the work now even if you want to."
    The following is a self-criticism by Deputy Township Head Tan Fuchu. Tan Fuchu said that when he first arrived at the Jinping Agricultural Cooperative, he sat in the office all day listening to reports and asking for figures. The cooperative cadres went to the fields every day, but he couldn't get anything. He suggested that the cooperative set up a labor competition platform to boost production, but was first opposed by the cooperative cadres. At that time, he wandered around and couldn't find anything to do. The masses called him "flying all over the sky," and he was also very distressed. He asked the General Branch Secretary to transfer his work several times.
    Later, the Township General Branch Secretary helped him go deep into a production team and found that this team had forty-four mu of fields that had no fertilizer. He then realized that the cooperative cadres' report of 104 dan of fertilizer per mu was not true. In this way, he launched a week-long campaign to accumulate fertilizer throughout the cooperative, and he himself took the lead in accumulating fertilizer. As a result, the amount of native fertilizer per mu in the entire cooperative increased from more than 90 dan to 144 dan. Now, the production of the entire cooperative ranks first in the township.
    He said: "Now my work enthusiasm has also been improved, and I have confidence in running this cooperative well."
    Liu Binglin, the branch secretary and director of the Baini Agricultural Cooperative, also introduced his experience in "participating in production and leading production" for cooperative cadres. He said that now all the cooperative cadres in the entire cooperative personally plow the fields and turn over the fertilizer pits. While working with the commune members, he discovered that some commune members were doing poor quality work and made timely repairs. If you don't work together, it is difficult to see the quality of the work from the surface by checking it afterwards.
    He also said that it is not only possible to find quality problems. One day, the cooperative director and poor peasant commune member Liu Zuxi were turning over a fertilizer pit together, and found that Liu had no farm tools and could not go to work in the afternoon; they also found that another poor peasant commune member Deng Zhengyun had not gone to work for three days. Some people said Deng was lazy. The cooperative director found Deng to work and talk with him. Only then did he know that Deng was having financial difficulties and had to go out to earn money to buy food every day. Later, the cooperative committee decided to advance more than 1,100 yuan from the spring sideline income to buy food and add necessary farm tools for commune members with financial difficulties. In this way, the attendance rate of the entire cooperative increased from the original 67% to 98%.
    At the meeting, Township General Branch Secretary Liu Zuoming also introduced his experience in how to specifically help the cadres of the Liuxia Agricultural Cooperative go deep to find the reasons for reversing the commune members' low production enthusiasm.
    At the beginning of the spring plowing, the commune members of this cooperative made trouble to withdraw from the cooperative and did not go to work. More than 400 mu of winter fallow fields in the entire cooperative had not been plowed, making it the most backward cooperative in the township at that time. At that time, the cooperative cadres were distressed and did not know where to start, and most of them wanted to resign.
    Later, Liu Zuoming and the cooperative cadres went deep into the households to understand that the commune members were mainly dissatisfied with the cooperative's single-handedly managing rice production and earning low incomes. Some commune members openly proposed that "they are not willing to be hanged on one tree with the cooperative."
    It turned out that this cooperative did not develop diversified management based on the characteristics of the entire cooperative's large population and small amount of land last year, and the average annual income per person in the entire cooperative was only 34 yuan. This year, when formulating the production plan, it did not learn from last year's lessons. Even if the annual rice production plan is completed this year, the average annual income per person will only be 41 yuan. However, the cooperative cadres emphasized that there was no way to develop sideline production.
    After an in-depth investigation, Liu Zuoming found that the cooperative had an oil tea forest with an annual output of six to seven thousand catties that was barren; and found that local farmers historically managed 26 items of mountain forest and sideline production, including tea oil, paper pulp, oil press, and porterage. If all of them were managed, each person could increase their income by at least 25 yuan per year. Then Liu Zuoming helped the entire cooperative revise the production plan, increased the management items, so that the average income per person this year could be increased to 56 yuan. In this way, the emotions of the more than 30 households that had been making trouble to withdraw from the cooperative were stabilized.
    Liu said that now the attendance rate of this cooperative has reached more than 90%; the amount of native fertilizer accumulated per mu has increased from more than 10 dan to 108 dan; and the winter fallow fields have also been eliminated. More than 40 mu of mountain soil that had not been planned for management is also being prepared for planting sweet potatoes. The cooperative cadres' enthusiasm for work has also increased. He Fengyao, the former deputy director who resigned and prepared to move to another township, personally repaired the oil press, expressing his confidence in running the cooperative well. He has been elected as the director of the cooperative by the commune members.
    At the meeting, everyone realized that the masses had long demanded that we improve our working methods and had long demanded that we do this.

    群众要求我们改进工作方法
    ——中共店门前乡总支委员、分支部书记联席会旁听记
    新华社记者　胡坚
  　湖南省衡山县店门前乡在中共衡山县委员会委员刘作明兼任乡总支部书记以后，领导生产工作已经有了许多改进。这些改进主要表现在：在刘作明的带领下，全体乡干部和社干部的工作都比以前深入了。十五个乡干部都有五分之四的时间住在生产队，每人还经常掌握五户不同阶层的社员思想情况。干部们既做了工作，每人还为军属积了二十担粪肥。全乡三百多名农业社干部除领导生产外，也大都做了二、三十个劳动日。深入后，他们发现问题快，解决得也快，而且肯和群众商量，因而生产搞得好，群众也拥护。最近，中共乡总支委员和分支书记特开会总结了改进工作方法的经验。
    总支委员陈炳元在会上介绍了他在新桥农业社发动社员扩大种植双季稻的经验。这位曾担任过两年乡支部书记的乡干部，看到去年新桥社双季稻丰收，今年又修好了水利，便找社干部商量了一下，要把全社双季稻由去年一百二十一亩一下扩大到三百二十亩。他照例开会向社员宣布后，看到当时大家没有什么意见，就满以为问题解决了。
    可是，在向各生产队包产的时候，发现社员们对许多田就不同意改种双季稻，同意改种的只有一百五十亩。要是过去发现这类问题，就由社干部去打通社员的思想。可是这次，陈炳元和社员反复算增产增收、生活改善和劳力出路等三笔账。中间，他发现有的社员的意见有道理。于是又同社干部和老农一起，背着册子到田间去逐丘鉴定，把一些不适宜种双季稻的田去掉。经过一个多月的艰苦工作，最后社员才同意种二百四十七亩双季稻。
    陈炳元很感慨地说：“群众觉悟高了，现在的工作你想包办也包办不起来。”
  　下面是副乡长谭福初的检查。谭福初说，他刚到金坪农业社工作时，成天坐在办公室内听汇报、要数字。社干部每天都下田去了，什么也要不到。他建议社里扎劳动竞赛台，把生产轰起来，但首先遭到社干部反对。那时候，他东游西荡，找不到事做，群众叫他“满天飞”，自己也很苦恼。几次要求总支书记调动工作。
      后来，乡总支书记帮助他深入一个生产队，才发现这个队有四十四亩田还没有肥料。他才明白社干部汇报每亩一百零四担肥料的情况不实在。这样，他才发动全社开展了一周突击积肥运动，他自己也带头积肥。结果，全社每亩土肥由九十多担增加到一百四十四担。现在，全社生产在全乡数第一。
    他说：“现在我的工作情绪也提高了，有信心把这个社办好。”
    分支部书记兼白泥农业社主任刘炳林也介绍了他对社干部“参加生产领导生产”的体会。他说，现在全社社干部都亲自犁田、翻肥料坑了。他在和社员一起劳动中，才发现有些社员做活质量不好，及时进行了反工补救。如果不一起劳动，靠事后检查，从表面上是很难看出质量好坏的。
    他还说，不只能发现质量问题。有一天，社主任和贫农社员刘祖西一道翻肥料坑，发现刘没有农具，下午不能出工；还发现另一贫农社员邓正运三天都没出工。有些人说邓懒。社主任便找邓一起劳动谈心。这才知道邓是因为生活困难，天天要到外面去挣钱买粮。后来社委会便决定从春季副业收入中预支一千一百多元给生活困难的社员买粮和添置必要的农具。这样，全社出勤率由原来的67％上升到98％。
    会上乡总支部书记刘作明也介绍了他怎样具体帮助流霞农业社干部深入下去找出原因扭转社员生产情绪不高的局面的经验。
    这个社春耕开始时，社员闹退社，不出工，全社四百多亩过冬板田没有耕，是当时全乡生产最落后的一个社。那时候社干部苦恼，不知从何下手，大都要辞职不干。
    后来，刘作明和社干部一道深入到户了解，发现社员主要是对社里单打一地经营稻谷生产、收入少不满。有些社员公开提出“不愿跟着社里吊死在一棵树上”。
    原来，这个社去年就没有根据全社人多田少的特点开展多种经营，全社平均每人全年收入只有三十四元。今年在制订生产计划时，又没有很好吸取去年教训。即令今年完成全年稻谷生产计划，每人平均全年收入也只有四十一元。而社干部却强调说没有副业生产门路。
    刘作明深入调查后，发现这个社有年产六、七千斤的油茶林却荒芜着；并且发现当地农民历史上经营的山林和副业生产有茶油、纸糟、榨坊、挑脚等二十六项，如果全部经营起来，每人每年至少可增加二十五元的收入。接着刘作明帮助全社修订了生产计划，增加了经营项目，使每人今年的平均收入可以增加到五十六元。这样原来闹退社的三十多户社员的情绪才稳定了。
    刘说，现在这个社出勤率达到了90％以上；每亩田所积的土肥由原来十多担增加到了一百零八担；过冬板田也消灭了。原来没有计划经营的四十多亩山土也正准备栽红薯。社干部的工作劲头也大了。原来辞职不干、并准备搬到外乡去住的副主任何逢尧亲自动手修理油榨坊，表示有信心把社办好。何已经被社员选为社主任了。
    会上，大家都体会到：群众早就要求我们改进工作方法，早就要求我们这样作了。
