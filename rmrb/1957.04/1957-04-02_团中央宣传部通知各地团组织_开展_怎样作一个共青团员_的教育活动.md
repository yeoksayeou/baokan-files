Xinhua News Agency, March 31st. The Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League (CYL) has issued a notice to local CYL organizations, requesting them to widely launch an education campaign on "How to Be a Communist Youth League Member," in anticipation of the upcoming Third National Congress of the CYL, where a resolution will be passed to change the name of the China New Democratic Youth League to the Communist Youth League of China, and the Charter of the Communist Youth League of China will be adopted.

The notice states that the change of the CYL's name is a major event in the history of the Chinese youth movement. It signifies that the Party and the state have placed greater expectations and demands on the CYL. It also demonstrates that the ideological awareness of China's young people and CYL members has further improved, and they are prepared to undertake more glorious duties. Undoubtedly, the change of the CYL's name will generate tremendous encouragement among all CYL members and the broad masses of young people.

The notice then discusses the urgent significance of strengthening communist ideological education among young people. The notice says that establishing communist ideology among young people nationwide, and eliminating the influence of capitalist ideology, is of particularly great significance to the victory of our great socialist cause. CYL members are advanced elements among young people. Only when all CYL members first arm themselves with communist ideology and play a model role in all positions can the CYL truly become the core organization for uniting and educating the young masses, and can it influence and educate the broad masses of young people to advance together under the new situation.

The notice says that for this reason, the CYL Central Committee has decided to launch a broad and in-depth education campaign on "How to Be a Communist Youth League Member" among all CYL members and young activists for a period of three to six months, before and after the convening of the Third National Congress of the CYL, in conjunction with the name change of the CYL. Through this education campaign, all CYL members are required to understand the great significance of changing the CYL's name, understand the glorious tasks of the Communist Youth League, and the lofty responsibility of being a CYL member. This will enable them to be more strict with themselves, to firmly establish the great ideal of struggling for the cause of communism, and to serve the people loyally; to strengthen collectivist ideology, overcome individualist ideology; to strengthen the cultivation of organizational discipline; to closely connect with the broad masses of young people, and to become communist fighters who are the first to bear hardship and the last to enjoy comforts, who only fulfill obligations and do not enjoy privileges in the struggle to build socialism.

The notice goes on to say, after discussing some steps and practices for carrying out this education campaign, that launching the education campaign on "How to Be a Communist Youth League Member" is another important step, following the revolutionary tradition education, to effectively improve the communist ideological awareness and moral character of CYL members. In this education process, it is necessary to adopt the guiding principle of active guidance and positive education, and the method of self-education by the masses under leadership, and not to use simple and blunt methods to carry out ideological criticism.

    团中央宣传部通知各地团组织
    开展“怎样作一个共青团员”的教育活动
    新华社31日讯　在即将召开的青年团第三次全国代表大会上，将要通过中国新民主主义青年团改名为中国共产主义青年团的决议，通过中国共产主义青年团的章程，青年团中央宣传部为此发出通知，要求各地团组织广泛开展一个“怎样作一个共青团员”的教育活动。
    通知中说，团的名称的更改，是中国青年运动史上的一件大事，这意味着党和国家对青年团提出了更大的期望和要求，也表明了我国青年群众和青年团员的思想觉悟有了进一步的提高，并准备去承担更光荣的义务。无疑地，团的名称的更改，必将在全体青年团员和广大的青年群众中产生巨大的鼓舞力量。
    通知接着谈到当前加强对青年进行共产主义思想教育的迫切意义。通知说，在全国青年中树立共产主义思想，清除资本主义思想的影响，对我们伟大的社会主义事业的胜利，具有特别重大的意义。青年团员是青年中的先进分子，只有全体青年团员首先用共产主义思想把自己武装起来，并在各个岗位上发挥模范作用，才能使青年团真正成为团结教育青年群众的核心组织，才能影响和教育广大青年，在新的形势下共同前进。
    通知说，为此团中央决定：在召开第三次团代大会前后，结合团的改名，以三个月到半年的时间，在全体青年团员和青年积极分子中，广泛深入地开展一个“怎样作一个共青团员”的教育活动。通过这次教育活动，要求全体青年团员懂得更改团的名称的重大意义，懂得共产主义青年团的光荣任务和作一个共青团员的崇高责任。从而使他们更加严格地要求自己，坚定为共产主义事业而奋斗的伟大理想，忠诚地为人民服务；加强集体主义思想，克服个人主义思想；加强组织纪律的修养；紧密地联系广大青年群众，在建设社会主义的斗争中，成为吃苦在前、享福在后，只尽义务、不享特权的共产主义战士。
    通知接着在谈到开展这一教育活动的一些步骤和做法之后说，开展“怎样作一个共青团员”的教育活动，是在继革命传统教育之后，为了有效地提高共青团员的共产主义思想觉悟和道德品质的又一个重要步骤。在这次教育过程中，要求采取积极引导、正面教育的方针和有领导的群众自我教育的方法，而不要用简单生硬的办法去进行思想批判。
