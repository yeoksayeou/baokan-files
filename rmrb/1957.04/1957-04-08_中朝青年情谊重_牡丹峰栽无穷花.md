Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 7th -- Today, Chinese and Korean youths planted 150,000 saplings on Moranbong Hill in Pyongyang. More than 10,000 young workers, students from Pyongyang, young soldiers from the Chinese People's Volunteers, and young overseas Chinese participated in the tree planting.

The large-scale tree planting began after the Chinese and Korean youth representatives planted a Rose of Sharon. Cementing their friendship formed in battle, the Chinese and Korean youths then planted thousands of Rose of Sharon, black locusts, elms, and other trees in front of the Liberation Tower and around Moranbong Hill. During breaks, the youths from both countries held a get-together.

More than 5,000 trees planted last year by the youths of the two countries on Moranbong Hill have already taken root, and green buds have sprouted on the willow branches.

    中朝青年情谊重
    牡丹峰栽无穷花
    新华社平壤7日电　朝中两国的青年今天在平壤市牡丹峰上种下了十五万株树苗。参加植树的有一万多名平壤市的青年工人、学生和中国人民志愿军的青年军人以及华侨青年。
    大规模的植树是在朝中两国青年代表栽下一株无穷花以后开始的。结下了战斗友谊的朝中两国青年接着在解放塔前和牡丹峰周围纷纷种下了千百株的无穷花、洋槐、榆树和其它的树木。到了休息的时候，两国青年举行了联欢。
    去年这时两国青年在牡丹峰上栽下的五千多棵树木都已经成活，杨柳枝头已经吐出绿芽了。
