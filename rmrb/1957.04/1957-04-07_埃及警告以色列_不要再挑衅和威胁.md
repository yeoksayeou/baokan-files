Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, April 6th: The Director of the Egyptian Information Bureau, Hatem, issued a statement on the 5th regarding Israel's repeated clamoring for a renewed invasion of Egypt, warning Israel not to "engage in provocations."

Hatem said that Israeli Prime Minister Ben-Gurion and Foreign Minister Golda Meir have made provocations a hundred times by now. The most recent of these provocative talks was Mrs. Meir's threat to reoccupy the Sinai Peninsula.

Hatem said, "Israel should remember that when they participated in the war last October, they were under the protection of Britain and France." He said, "The facts have been exposed, and Israel is playing the role of an imperialist servant."

Xinhua News Agency, April 6th: Washington News: According to diplomatic sources in Washington, Israel is discussing with the United States, Britain, France, and other countries how to send ships to the southern Israeli port of Eilat in order to "determine the right of innocent passage within the Gulf of Aqaba." It is reported that the United States has plans to send a ship through the Straits of Tiran, the entrance to the Gulf of Aqaba, soon.

There are also reports that Israel has notified the United States of its intention to send an Israeli ship for a trial passage through the Suez Canal at a certain time, and hopes that the United States will "take the lead in supporting" it.

The news says that Israel's plan is based on Eisenhower's recent talks about the Suez Canal.

News says that Israel has also told the United States that if Israel's "trial voyage" is obstructed, it will not hesitate to launch another attack on Egypt.

Xinhua News Agency, April 6th: Damascus News: A Syrian Army spokesperson condemned on the 5th that Israeli troops fired at Syrian border posts six times on the 4th and the morning of the 5th.

The spokesperson said that Israeli troops fired at Syria from positions on Lake Hula, and Syria did not retaliate.

This is the fourth border shooting incident in the Lake Hula area since March 20.

News from Gaza says that the representative of Egypt to the Mixed Armistice Commission protested the intrusion of Israeli jet fighters into the airspace over Gaza on the 5th. Prior to this, Egypt had already protested the intrusion of Israeli military aircraft into Gaza on the 2nd.

    埃及警告以色列
    不要再挑衅和威胁
    新华社开罗6日电　埃及新闻局长哈特姆5日就以色列一再叫嚣要对埃及重新发动侵略一事发表声明，警告以色列不要“进行挑衅”。
    哈特姆说，以色列总理本—古里安和外交部长梅厄夫人提出的挑衅，到现在已经有一百次了。这种挑衅性谈话的最近一次是梅厄夫人威胁着要重新占领西奈半岛。
    哈特姆说，“以色列应当记住，当他们参加去年十月的战争的时候，他们是在英、法的保护下的。”他说，“事实已经暴露，以色列是充当帝国主义的仆从角色。”
    新华社6日讯　华盛顿消息：据华盛顿外交界人士说，以色列正在同美、英、法等国家商谈怎样派遣船只驶赴以色列南部海港埃拉特，以“确定亚喀巴湾内的无害通航权”，据报道，美国已经计划不久派一只船去通过亚喀巴湾入口的蒂朗海峡。
    还有消息说，以色列已经通知美国，它打算在一定时期派一艘以色列船去试验穿越苏伊士运河，并且希望美国“带头支持”。
    消息说，以色列的这种计划是以艾森豪威尔最近关于苏伊士运河的一些谈话为根据的。
    有消息说，以色列还告诉美国，如果以色列的“试验航行”受阻，它将不惜再向埃及发动进攻。
    新华社6日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚陆军发言人5日谴责以色列军队在4日和5日早晨向叙利亚边防阵地开枪达六次之多。
    发言人说，以色列军队从胡拉湖的阵地上向叙利亚射击，叙利亚没有还击。
    这是胡拉湖一带从3月20日以来发生的第四次边境射击事件。
    来自加沙的消息说，埃及驻混合停战监督委员会的代表就以色列喷气式战斗机在5日侵入加沙上空提出抗议。在这以前，埃及已经对以色列军用飞机在2日侵入加沙的事件提出过抗议。
