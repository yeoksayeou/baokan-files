    Extracting Caffeine from Fish Scales
    Caffeine is the main raw material for manufacturing cardiotonics and "A, P, C" and other medicines used to treat colds. In foreign countries, coffee and cocoa produced in the tropics are generally used as raw materials. After 1950, China began to use tea waste to trial-produce it, but the output was very small.
    In 1953, Dong Zhenshun, an engineer at Zhejiang Pharmaceutical Factory, saw an article published in a Soviet fisheries magazine stating that caffeine could be extracted from fish scales, and cooperated with technician Wu Yunyao to experiment. After several years of experimentation and research, they finally succeeded.

    从鱼鳞中提取咖啡因
    咖啡因是制造强心针和治疗伤风感冒用的“A、P、C”等药品的主要原料。在外国一般都用热带产的咖啡、可可做原料。1950年以后，我国开始利用茶叶末试制，产量也很小。
    1953年，浙江制药厂工程师董振舜看到苏联鱼业杂志上刊载一篇从鱼鳞中可以提炼咖啡因的文章，便同技术员吴云耀合作试验。经过几年的试验研究，终于获得成功。
