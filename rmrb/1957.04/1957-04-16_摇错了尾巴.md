    Waggling the Wrong Tail
    Lú Wéi
The British decision to relax the comprehensive embargo against Democratic Korea infuriated Lee Seung-man's Foreign Minister Cao Zheng Huan. He boasted to the "congressmen" in the "National Assembly" that in order to stop Britain, he would not hesitate to mobilize the "navy" given by the United States. But, but... something was not quite right. The master in Washington had not yet spoken on this matter, and the dog's tail wagged randomly without the dog's head giving a signal. Doesn't this show that the tail's loyalty to the head is insufficient? Cao Zheng Huan had plenty of courage to correct his mistake, and he quickly retracted the tail he wagged incorrectly, declaring: this is just a "rhetorical expression", "just a hypothetical answer to a hypothetical question."

    摇错了尾巴
    卢韦英国决定放松对民主朝鲜的全面禁运，这消息气坏了李承晚的外务部长官曹正焕。他在“国会”里向“议员”们夸下了海口：为了制止英国，他将不惜动员美国给的“海军”。可是，可是……事情有点不大对头，华盛顿的主子对这件事还没有开口，狗头没有发出信号狗尾巴就随便乱摇，岂不是说明尾巴对狗头的忠诚不够？曹正焕纠正错误的勇气倒是蛮足，他赶紧把摇错了的尾巴往里一缩，声明：我这不过是“修辞上的一种说法”，“不过是对假想的问题提出的假想答复。”（附图片）
