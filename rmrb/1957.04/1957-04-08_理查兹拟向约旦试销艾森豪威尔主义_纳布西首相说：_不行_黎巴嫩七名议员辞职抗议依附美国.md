Xinhua News Agency, April 7th: Amman News: Jordanian Prime Minister Nabulsi delivered a speech on the evening of the 5th, stating that Jordan cannot accept the Eisenhower Doctrine. Nabulsi said that Jordan "welcomes all unconditional aid, whether it comes from the East or the West. However, if Richards, as a representative of the United States, asks me, as a representative of Jordan, to sign a brief statement saying that we have agreed to fight communism and that he will pay me one hundred million dollars, then I will say to him: 'No'".

He said: "Does Eisenhower have control over us? Who appointed him as our protector? Is he another prophet sent by Allah? ... The people of this region do not need new prophets who will drag us into the abyss of conflict and exploitation, into new forms of imperialism." Nabulsi called on Arab countries to unite. He said that Jordan's abolition of the Anglo-Jordanian Treaty was the first step in this direction. He said the second step would be the establishment of a Jordan, Syria, and Egypt Federation.

Xinhua News Agency, April 6th: Beirut News: Seven prominent Lebanese political leaders resigned from their parliamentary seats on the 5th when parliament passed a vote of confidence in the government, in protest against the government's pursuit of a pro-American Middle East policy.

One of the seven resigning parliamentarians, former Prime Minister Yafi, condemned the "Eisenhower Doctrine" during the debate as a "military treaty in disguise." Yafi pointed out: "By adhering to this doctrine, the Lebanese government has isolated itself from other Arab countries," and it has also adopted "an attitude of hostility towards Russia, the great friend of the Arabs."

    理查兹拟向约旦试销艾森豪威尔主义
    纳布西首相说：“不行”
    黎巴嫩七名议员辞职抗议依附美国
    据新华社7日讯　安曼消息：约旦首相纳布西5日晚上发表演说，表示约旦不能接受艾森豪威尔主义。纳布西说，约旦“欢迎一切无条件的援助，不管是来自东方还是西方。可是，如果理查兹以美国代表的身份要求我以约旦代表的身份签署一份简短的声明，说什么我们已经同意对共产主义进行斗争，说什么他将要付给我一亿美元，那么我就要对他说：‘不行’”。
    他说：“艾森豪威尔管得着我们吗？谁封他作我们的保护者呢？他是真主所差遣来的另一位先知吗？……我们这个地区的人们不需要那些要把我们拖进冲突和剥削的深渊、拖进新形式的帝国主义的新的先知。”　　纳布西号召阿拉伯国家团结起来。他说，约旦废除了英—约条约，这就是走向这种方向的第一个步骤。他说，第二步是成立约旦、叙利亚、埃及联邦。　　据新华社6日讯　贝鲁特消息：黎巴嫩七个著名的政界领袖5日在议会通过对政府的信任案时辞去了议员的职务，以抗议政府追随美国的中东政策。
    辞去议员职务的七人之一、前总理雅非在辩论中谴责“艾森豪威尔主义”是“伪装起来的军事条约”。雅非指出：“由于依附了这个主义，黎巴嫩政府已经使自己从其他阿拉伯国家孤立起来”，它也使自己采取了“敌视阿拉伯人的伟大朋友俄国的态度”。
