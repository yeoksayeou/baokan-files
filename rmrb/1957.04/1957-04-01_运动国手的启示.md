    Enlightenment from Sports National Team Members
    Qin Mu

    Recently, the National Volleyball First Division League was held in Guangzhou. When the league began, the Xinhua News Agency issued an interesting dispatch, reporting that players from Taishan County accounted for more than one-third of the league's participants. In the twelve men's teams participating in the league, ten teams had athletes from Taishan County. Out of the one hundred and forty-four male players, fifty-nine were from Taishan County. If we compare the results of the competition with this dispatch, we can discover even more interesting things. Of the twelve players on the August 1st Men's Volleyball Team, which won the championship, ten were from Taishan County. Of the twelve players on the Beijing Men's Volleyball Team, which came in second place, eight were also from Taishan County.

    This situation is by no means accidental. As described in that dispatch, Taishan County currently has more than one thousand eight hundred volleyball teams and one thousand six hundred volleyball courts. It is precisely because the atmosphere of volleyball is so vigorous that it can cultivate so many national team members. If we were to visit this county in Guangdong, we would see an unusually large number of volleyball courts everywhere. Not long ago, a volleyball team organized by teenagers there even defeated a team of adults who had come to visit.

    This type of situation also exists in other sports. For example, in national cycling competitions, many of the winners are from Chenghai County, Guangdong. The reason is that bicycle transportation of goods and people is very common in this county, which has trained many athletes. There are also some "sports families," where the entire family are sports masters. For example, the family of Wang Chuanyao, the national table tennis champion, is like this. His father has played table tennis for decades, and his wife and younger brother are table tennis champions for students in Beijing and Shanghai, respectively. There are quite a few families like this, just as there are many "art families" and "music families."

    These types of things illustrate a very simple truth that is often overlooked: people acquire talents through cultivation and effort. People have many potentials, and as long as they are brought into play, they become capable.

    It is not that people in Taishan have a special talent for playing volleyball, nor that people in Chenghai have a special talent for riding bicycles; rather, it is because the conditions for cultivation are sufficient there, and the sports atmosphere is vigorous, so many masters have been cultivated. By the same token, those "sports families," "art families," and "music families" are nothing more than the result of children being immersed in a certain learning atmosphere created by their parents, thus training and increasing certain talents.

    This principle is originally very simple, but due to the influence of the bourgeoisie's "intelligence tests" and "theory of talent" in the past, many people still cannot truly grasp it. When encountering people with certain talents, they often think of "genius." This kind of thinking, for ordinary people, hinders the development of their own potential, and for those who have certain talents, it often easily breeds a kind of inexplicable arrogance. After being cultivated by the environment and the masses, they turn around and "bite the hand that feeds them," arrogantly despising the environment and the masses that nurtured them. Both types of behavior are very regrettable and even ridiculous.

    With objective cultivation and subjective effort, people can show their talents. This principle is particularly clear in the age of historical change. During the peasant uprisings at the end of the Yuan Dynasty, countless heroes emerged in the Huai River basin. During the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolution in the Qing Dynasty, countless heroes emerged in Guangxi Province. In the contemporary revolutionary cause in China, the number of heroes emerging everywhere is even more countless. Don't these examples also illustrate very well: there are many seemingly ordinary people, perhaps they cannot read a single word, perhaps no one knows them five miles away. When they are silently hoeing fields and twisting hemp ropes, who would have thought that when the revolutionary storm arrives, there would be so many Xu Das, Chang Yuchuns, Yang Xiuqings, and Li Xiuchengs among them? However, the objective facts are indeed like this.

    Thinking further from this principle, we can realize: everyone has many potentials that are not well developed in ordinary times, and many people even bring this potential to the grave intact. In places where people carry things on their heads, women can carry things weighing one hundred and several tens of catties on their heads. In acrobatic troupes, actors can walk on their hands instead of their feet. People with disabled hands have practiced to the point where they can use their feet to write and operate typewriters. In times of war, many drivers can drive cars by starlight... We don't usually need to advocate carrying things on our heads, walking on our hands, writing with our feet, or driving cars by starlight... However, don't these things also tell us a principle: heads, hands, feet, eyes..., if we exercise them, they actually have so many magical powers. There are still many people among us who cannot ride bicycles and dare not walk across a single-plank bridge, but in the circus, clumsy bears can actually ride bicycles and dance in rhythm. Doesn't this performance also tell us this principle in a rather ironic way!

    Previous people used this saying to describe writers who had not fully developed their talents: "Ancient articles have not exhausted talent." This sentence can actually be transferred to many different kinds of people. Those who have exhausted their efforts and fully developed their talents and died may account for a very small number in mankind. There are quite a few people who have good hands and good brains, but they have not fully developed their potential. Those who, with perseverance, have finished reading encyclopedias, or who have become experts from being illiterate through self-study, who have become sports national team members through constant hard work, people's military strategists who came from shepherd backgrounds, labor models who complete two or three years' worth of work quotas in a year... They have relatively developed the potential of life. But to think that many of us are "holding a golden rice bowl and begging for food," wasting the potential of life, is really a "heartbreaking" matter.

    The hometowns of some sports national team members made me think of these things in a fragmentary way. I think this principle may be helpful for us to overcome a morbid emotion, a harmful and self-harming morbid emotion that is deeply influenced by history and is still quite popular: pride and inferiority.

    运动国手的启示
    秦牧
    最近，全国排球甲级队联赛在广州举行。联赛开始的时候，新华社发过一则有趣的电讯，报道参加联赛的各队队员，台山籍的占三分之一以上。在参加联赛的十二个男子队中，有十个队都有台山籍的运动员。在一百四十四名男子球员中，台山籍的运动员就占了五十九名。如果我们从比赛的结果来对照这则电讯，就可以发现更加有趣的事情。夺得冠军的八一男子排球队，十二个队员中，台山县的有十人。得到亚军的北京市男子排球队，十二个队员中，也有八个是台山县人。
    这情形决不是偶然的。正像那则电讯所叙述的，台山县目前有一千八百多个排球队和一千六百多个排球场。正因为排球运动的风气这样蓬勃，所以能够培育出这样多的国手。如果我们到广东的这个县份去走一遭，是可以到处看到多得异常的排球场的。不久以前，那里少年人组织的一队排球队，甚至还击败了一队远征到那里的成年人的排球队。
    这一类的情形，在其他的体育部门中也存在。例如在全国的自行车竞赛中，优胜者有好些都是广东澄海县人。原因就是这个县自行车运货载人的活动很普遍，锻炼了不少的健儿的缘故。还有一些家庭是“体育家庭”，整个家庭里面都是体育名手。例如全国乒乓球冠军王传耀的一家就是这样。他的父亲打了几十年乒乓球，他的妻子、弟弟分别是北京、上海学生乒乓球冠军。类似这样的家庭是不少的，正像同样有许多的“美术家庭”、“音乐家庭”的道理一样。
    这一类的事情，说明了一个十分浅显，但却常常为人们所忽略的道理：人都是靠培养和努力而获得才能的。人有许许多多的潜力，只要发挥出来，就变得有本领了。
    并不是台山的人特别有打排球的天才，也不是澄海的人特别有踏自行车的天才；而是，由于那里的培养条件充足，体育空气蓬勃，因此，就培养出许许多多的名手来了。同样的道理，那些“体育家庭”、“美术家庭”、“音乐家庭”什么的，不外是由于子弟们陶冶于家长们所造成的某一种学习气氛中，因此，就锻炼和增长了某种才干了。
    这道理本来简单得很，但由于过去资产阶级的“智力测验”、“天分论”的影响，好些人仍然不能够真正地掌握它。遇到具有某种才能的人，经常会想到“天才”上面去。这样的想头，对于一般人来说，是妨碍了自己的潜力的发挥，对于那些具有某种才能的人来说，常常容易因而滋长一种莫名其妙的骄傲情绪。在受到环境和群众的培养之后，反过来“狗咬吕洞宾”，骄傲地蔑视培养他的环境和群众。无论是属于哪一种行为，都是十分可惜甚至可笑的事情。
    在客观培养和主观努力下，人就能够显示出才干。这种道理在历史变革的年代显示得格外清楚。元末的农民暴动，淮河流域涌现了不知多少的英雄。清代的太平天国革命，广西一省又不知涌现了多少的英雄。在中国当代的革命事业中，各地涌现的英雄就多得更不待说了。这种事例不也很好地说明：有许多外表看似平凡的人物，也许他一字不识，也许五里外都没有人知道他。在他默默地锄田和搓着麻绳的时候，有谁想到在革命风暴到来的时候，这里面就有许许多多的徐达、常遇春、杨秀清、李秀成呢。然而客观的事实却的确如此。
    从这个道理想开去，我们可以觉察：原来每个人都有许多的潜力，平时都没有好好发挥，甚至有不少人原封不动地把这种潜力带到坟墓里面去。在用头顶物的地方，妇女们能够用头顶一百几十斤重的东西。在杂技团里，演员们能够用手代替双脚走路。双手残废的人，有的练习到能用脚来写字和运用打字机。在战争的年代里，不少司机借着星光就能开动汽车……。我们平时并不需要提倡用头顶物，用手走路，用脚写字，借星光开汽车……；然而这些事情不也告诉我们一个道理么：头、手、脚、眼睛……，如果我们加以锻炼，原来它们竟还有这么多的神奇的力量呢。我们人类中还有许多人不会驾驶机器脚踏车和不敢走过独木桥，然而在马戏班里，笨拙的狗熊却居然会驾驶机器脚踏车和合于节拍地跳舞了。这种表演不也怪带讽刺意味地告诉了我们这点道理么！
    前人形容写文章的人未曾充分发挥才能，说过这样的话：“千古文章未尽才”。这句话其实可以移赠给许许多多各种各样的人。那些呕尽心血，充分发挥才智而死的人，也许在人类中占的数量很小。倒是有相当多的人，好好的手，好好的脑子，都没有充分去发挥它的潜力。那些本着毅力，读完了百科全书的人，或者从一字不识，靠自学变成专家的人，不断苦练，成为运动国手的人，牧童出身的人民军事家，一年做两三年工作定额的劳动模范……，他们是比较地发挥了生命的潜力的。但一想到我们中有许多人是“拿着个金饭碗讨饭吃”的生命潜力的浪费者，却真是令人“惊呼热中肠”的一回事。
    从一些运动国手的籍贯使我零碎地想起这些事情。我想，这道理也许对我们克服一种病态情绪不无好处，这种深受历史影响，现在还颇流行的害人害己的病态情绪就是：骄傲与自卑。
