Xinhua News Agency Report:

    The Shanghai Huiguang Amateur Supplementary School, a private school, has now expanded to eighteen junior high school classes, with a total of 1,039 students, including employees studying in their spare time.
    The Huiguang Amateur Supplementary School is run jointly by more than ten intellectuals in society. When it was founded in 1953, it had only a dozen students. Two years ago, the teachers personally renovated three dilapidated houses into classrooms and expanded enrollment to more than one hundred students. They also borrowed classrooms from a nearby school in the evenings to provide cultural supplementary education for workers in factories and enterprises during their spare time. In this way, they have diligently run the school and accumulated several thousand yuan over the years, and with the help of the District People's Committee and neighboring supplementary schools, they have built three new classrooms.

    上海一民办学校办得好
    据新华社讯　民办的上海汇光业余补习学校，现在已发展到十八个初中班级，包括职工业余学习在内，共有学生一千零三十九人。
    汇光业余补习学校是由十多个社会知识分子合作举办的。1953年创办的时候，只有十几个学生。两年前，教师们亲自把三间破旧的民房修建为教室，扩大招收学生一百多人。晚上还向附近一所学校借用教室，为工厂企业的职工利用业余时间补习文化。这样，他们几年来勤俭办学，共积累了几千元，并且得到区人民委员会和邻近补习学校的帮助，又建造了三个新教室。
