Xinhua News Agency, April 1st: Xinhua News Agency reporter Sun Minghui reports: The five machinery factories to be built in a new industrial zone in Shaanxi Province have decided to organize factory construction in a unified manner according to the principle of collaboration. This decision was recently made by the State Planning Commission and the State Construction Commission.

According to relevant sources, these five factories will construct some workshops and public facilities based on the principle of collaboration. Preliminary calculations by the design department show that this can save at least 22 million yuan in factory construction investment. Furthermore, a considerable amount of production management costs can be saved annually after the factories are put into production.

These five factories produce products such as petroleum accessories, motors, and air compressors, and belong to the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, the Ministry of Electrical Machinery Manufacturing Industry, and the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry, respectively. Due to insufficient experience in the past, the construction of these factories was not planned in a unified manner according to industrial zones. The original plan was for each factory to be self-contained, constructing a complete set of workshops and public facilities (such as casting and forging workshops, carpentry workshops, boiler rooms, gas stations, oxygen stations, laboratories, etc.) required for its own production. As a result, not only was the investment high, but future production would also be uneconomical.

According to the collaborative principles recently planned by the State Construction Commission and the State Planning Commission, each factory will merge some workshops originally planned for decentralized construction, such as casting and forging workshops, carpentry workshops, boiler rooms, gas stations, and oxygen stations. Regional casting and forging factories, carpentry workshops, regional boiler rooms, gas stations, and oxygen stations will be built to provide unified services for each factory. In this way, because the scale of these workshops and public facilities is increased, the equipment capacity can be fully utilized, and the construction area and machinery and equipment can be reduced, saving a great deal of investment compared to decentralized construction.

The casting steel, cast iron, and forging workshops of these five factories will be merged to build a specialized casting and forging factory to produce collaborative parts for each factory. By reducing machinery and equipment and construction area, the investment can be saved by more than 10 million yuan compared to decentralized construction. After the five factories' originally planned decentralized construction of five boiler rooms and gas stations is carried out according to the principle of collaboration, more than 3 million yuan in investment can be saved. Due to centralized production management and full utilization of equipment capacity after collaboration, the five factories can reduce many production personnel and staff without reducing the scale of production. As a result, employee dormitories and other welfare facilities are also reduced, saving a total of more than 2 million yuan in investment in this regard.

According to relevant sources, building factories according to the principle of collaboration will also create favorable conditions for improving labor productivity, reducing product costs, ensuring product quality, and fully expanding in the future. For example, the casting and forging workshops of the five factories are merged to build a professional casting and forging factory. Because more advanced process equipment can be used, it is expected that workers' labor productivity will be one to two times higher than that of decentralized workshops, and the loss of metal materials can also be greatly reduced. These factories can save a large amount of production management costs annually after they are put into production.

The proposal to organize the construction of these five factories according to the principle of collaboration was initiated by the First Design Sub-bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry. In the process of designing a certain factory, they discovered the possibility of organizing collaborative production and provided information on economic comparisons. The State Construction Commission and the State Planning Commission strongly supported the design department's proposal, repeatedly studied and negotiated with the construction departments, overcame ideological obstacles in organizing collaboration, and unified their understanding. At the same time, preliminary arrangements were made for the cooperative relationship and construction progress of each factory.

Organizing so many factories in an industrial area to build factories according to the principle of collaboration is the first time in our country. According to relevant sources, due to insufficient experience in collaboration, the factory construction plan may still change, and this collaboration plan will be further improved in the planning of the Second Five-Year Plan.

### 基本建设中一项重大的节约措施在陕西开始采用  按工业区统一规划协作建厂

    基本建设中一项重大的节约措施在陕西开始采用
    按工业区统一规划协作建厂
    新华社1日讯　新华社记者孙铭惠报道：将要在陕西省一个新工业区兴建的五个机器厂，已经决定按照协作原则统一组织建厂。这个决定是由国家计划委员会和国家建设委员会最近作出的。
    据有关方面说，这五个厂在一些车间和公用设施方面按协作原则进行建设，根据设计部门初步计算，至少可以节省建厂投资二千二百万元，并且在投入生产以后每年还可以节省一笔数量相当可观的生产管理费用。
    这五个厂是生产石油配件、电机、空气压缩机等产品的工厂，分别属于石油工业部、电机制造工业部、第一机械工业部。由于过去经验不足，没有按工业区域统一规划这些工厂的建设，原计划每个厂都自成系统，分别建设本厂生产所需要的全套车间和公用设施（如铸锻车间、木工车间、锅炉房、煤气站、氧气站、实验室等），结果不仅投资多，而且将来的生产也不经济。
    按照国家建设委员会和国家计划委员会最近按协作原则规划的办法，各厂将把原计划分散建设的一些车间，如铸锻车间、木工车间、锅炉房、煤气站、氧气站等加以合并，建设区域性的铸锻工厂、木工车间，区域性的锅炉房、煤气站、氧气站等公用设施，统一为各厂服务。这样，由于这些车间和公用设施的规模增大，设备能力可以充分发挥，建筑面积和机器设备都有所减少，比分散建设大大节省了投资。
    这五个厂的铸钢、铸铁、锻工等车间合并建设一个专门为各厂生产协作件的铸锻厂；由于减少机器设备和建筑面积，就可以比分散建设节约投资一千多万元。五个厂原计划分散建设的五个锅炉房和煤气站按协作原则建设以后，可以节约投资三百多万元。由于协作以后生产管理集中、设备能力可以得到充分利用，五个厂在生产规模没有缩小的情况下，可以减少很多生产人员和工作人员，因而职工宿舍和其他福利设施也跟着减少，这方面总共可以节约投资二百多万元。
    据有关方面说，五个厂按协作原则建厂，还为提高劳动生产率、降低产品成本、保证产品质量，以及为今后充分扩建创造了有利条件。例如五个厂的铸锻车间合并建设专业的铸锻工厂，由于可以采用比较先进的工艺装备，预计工人劳动生产率将比分散的车间高出一、两倍，金属材料的损耗也可以大大减少，这些工厂投入生产以后每年可以节约大量生产管理费用。
    这五个厂按协作原则组织建厂，是由第一机械工业部所属第一设计分局倡议的。他们在设计某一个工厂的过程中，发现了组织协作生产的可能性，并且提供了经济比较方面的资料。国家建设委员会和国家计划委员会大力支持设计部门的提议，并且和各建设部门反复地进行了研究和协商，克服了组织协作中的思想障碍，统一了认识。同时对各厂的协作关系、建厂进度等也作了初步安排。
    按工业区域组织这样多的工厂按协作原则建厂，在我国还是第一次。据有关方面说，由于协作经验不足，建厂计划可能还有变动，这个协作方案还将在第二个五年计划的规划中作进一步的改进。
