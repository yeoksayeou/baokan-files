The National Youth Art Workers' Exhibition has been visited by over 34,000 people up to yesterday, and more than 300 people wrote down their opinions after the visit. Praise can be heard everywhere in the venue. They say that this is an exhibition with rich content, showing the talents and efforts of the younger generation in all aspects of art creation. Some written opinions also offered criticisms of individual works.

    The Chinese Artists Association organized two symposiums on March 27, one for oil painting, watercolor, sketching, illustration and the other for cartoon, inviting well-known artists in Beijing and some young art workers to participate. At the meeting, the artists gave certain evaluations of the exhibited works; the oil painting, watercolor, sketching, and illustration group discussed the issue of whether the artistic language of painting is suitable for depicting dramatic plots, as well as the issue of creating styles.

    Two more symposiums, one for traditional Chinese painting and the other for printmaking, will be held this afternoon at the Cultural Palace venue, and a symposium for New Year pictures, comic strips, posters and sculptures will be held next Wednesday. The exhibition will close on the 16th.

    青年一代的美术创作受到赞赏
    本报讯　到昨天为止，已有三万四千余人参观了全国青年美术工作者作品展览会，有三百余人在参观之后当时写下了他们的意见。在会场里到处可以听见观众的赞赏。他们说，这是一个内容丰富的展览会，显示了青年一代在美术创作的各方面的才能和努力。也有一些书面意见对于个别作品提出了批评。
    中国美术家协会3月27日曾经组织了油画、水彩、素描、插图和漫画两组座谈会，约请了在京知名美术家和部分青年美术工作者参加。会上，美术家们对于展出的作品给予了一定的评价；油画、水彩、素描、插图组对于绘画的艺术语言是否适宜于描写戏剧性情节的问题，以及创造风格的问题，进行了讨论。
    今日下午还有国画和版画两组座谈会在文化宫会场内举行，下星期三将举行年画、连环画、招贴画和雕塑的座谈会。展览会将在16日闭幕。
