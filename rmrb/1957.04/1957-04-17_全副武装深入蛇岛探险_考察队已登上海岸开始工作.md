Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: A Snake Island expedition team, determined to uncover the secrets of Snake Island, departed from Lüda City on the morning of the 13th for a three-day scientific expedition to Snake Island, located twenty-five nautical miles northwest of Lüshunkou. By noon on the 14th, they had landed on the island. The expedition team will investigate the island's terrain, climate, and geology, as well as study the animal and plant life.

This expedition team consists of twelve members from the Lüda Geographical Society and Zoological Society, led by Wu Lü, a professor at Dalian Medical College and a zoologist.

Before departing, the team members, along with film cameramen and reporters, re-checked their protective gear. Medical personnel accompanying the team brought along medicines.

After landing on the shore, the expedition team captured six pit vipers with snake tongs that afternoon. The pit vipers were approximately 60 to 70 centimeters long, with triangular heads and slender necks. These vipers are a species of Siberian pit viper. A mere tenth of a gram of pit viper venom can be fatal. One gram of venom can kill a thousand rabbits or thirty thousand pigeons. The expedition team also shot down a bird with a hunting rifle and collected three eagle carcasses, two bird sternums, and some small red mites.

Snake Island is approximately 1,300 meters long and 700 meters wide, with a circumference of about four kilometers. The rocks on Snake Island are as grayish-white as the pit vipers. The weather has not fully warmed up yet; the temperature on the summit of Snake Island is only 9 degrees Celsius during the day, and many snakes are still hibernating. While there are many snakes, they are not everywhere. There are many shrubs on Snake Island, but no tall trees have been found, only wild grasses about one meter high.

Because there are too many venomous snakes on the island, the team members are staying on the ship at night. They will continue their investigation on the 15th.

    全副武装深入蛇岛探险
    考察队已登上海岸开始工作
    据新华社讯　一支揭穿蛇岛秘密的蛇岛考察队已于13日上午从旅大市出发，到旅顺口西北二十五浬的蛇岛进行为时三天的科学考查。14日中午，他们已登上了海岛。考察队要在蛇岛上调查地势、气候和地质情况，同时要考察动物和植物的生活。
    这支考察队包括十二个人，他们是旅大地理学会和动物学会的成员，队长是大连医学院教授、动物学家伍律。
    考察队在出发的时候，队员们和电影摄影师、记者们又检查了防护用具。随同去蛇岛的卫生工作人员携带了药品。
    登上海岸以后，当天下午考察队就用蛇挟共捉住了六条蝮蛇。蝮蛇长约六十到七十公分。头呈三角形，颈部很细。蝮蛇是西伯利亚蝮蛇的一种。只要十分之一克的蝮蛇毒液，就能致人死命。一克毒液就能毒死一千只兔子，或者三万只鸽子。考察队还用猎枪打中了一只鸟，并搜集了三个鹰的尸骸、两根鸟类的胸骨和一些红色的小恙虫。
    蛇岛长约一千三百多公尺，宽约七百公尺，周围大约有四公里。蛇岛上的岩石和蝮蛇一样是灰白色的。目前这里天气还没有完全转暖，蛇岛山顶温度白天只有摄氏九度，许多蛇还冬眠未醒。蛇是很多的，但并不是满地皆是。蛇岛上有很多的灌木，没有发现高大的乔木，但有约一公尺高的野草。
    因为这个岛上毒蛇太多，队员们晚上在船上住宿。15日继续进行考察。
