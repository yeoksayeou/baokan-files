The signing ceremony for this concluding document was held on the 11th, and a joint communique was issued.

The communique stated: "With the complete conclusion of all work on the demarcation and re-demarcation of the Soviet-Iranian border, the Soviet-Iranian border line, approximately two thousand kilometers long, from the tri-junction of the Soviet Union, Iran, and Turkey to the tri-junction of the Soviet Union, Iran, and Afghanistan, has now been accurately demarcated on the ground, boundary markers have been erected, and it has been recorded in detail in special documents and mapped."

The communique pointed out that the signing ceremony for the concluding documents on the demarcation and re-demarcation of the Soviet-Iranian border – the Soviet-Iranian Border Description Protocol and the Summary Protocol – took place in Tehran on April 11, 1957.

The communique stated: "Both sides noted with satisfaction that all issues related to the Soviet-Iranian border have been completely resolved from now on, and the past disputes and misunderstandings between the two countries on this issue have been completely eliminated.

"Both sides expressed their firm belief that the satisfactory resolution of the border issue will help to further develop and strengthen the relations between the Soviet Union and Iran – relations between the two neighboring countries established in the spirit of friendship and good neighborliness, based on the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and mutual understanding.

"This is also in line with the wishes of the Soviet Union and Iran to defend and consolidate world peace."

The Soviet-Iranian Border Mixed Commission was established in accordance with the agreement between the Soviet Union and Iran on border and financial issues signed on December 2, 1954. It began work in August 1955 and finally re-demarcated the approximately two thousand kilometers long border line between the two countries.

    公报指出，关于划定和重新划定苏伊国界的总结性文件——苏伊两国国界记述议定书和总结议定书——的签字仪式，已经在1957年4月11日在德黑兰举行。

    “双方表示深信，国界问题的圆满解决将有助于进一步发展和加强苏联和伊朗的关系——两个邻国本着友好和睦邻的精神根据互相尊重主权和互相谅解的原则而建立的关系。
    “这也符合苏联和伊朗对保卫和巩固世界和平的愿望。”
    按苏伊国界混合委员会是根据1954年12月2日苏联和伊朗签订的关于边界和财政问题的协定设立的，1955年8月开始工作，终于重新划定了两国之间长约两千公里的国界线。
