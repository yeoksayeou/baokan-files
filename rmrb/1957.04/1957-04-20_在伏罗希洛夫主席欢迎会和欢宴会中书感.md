    Feelings Inscribed at Chairman Voroshilov's Welcome Reception and Banquet
    Chén Míngshū
    To subdue people with virtue is sufficient to recommend the worthy,
    Great achievements and heroic deeds do not concede to those of the past.
    I am delighted to behold the ear-shattering fame today,
    Who knew what intoxicated me was the compassionate spring.
    Surely, jade and silk will transform into shields and spears,
    Grasp peace, let no one interfere.
    From now on, the hydrogen bomb can truly be destroyed,
    The Soviet-Chinese defense will protect the world together.

    在伏罗希洛夫主席欢迎会和欢宴会中书感
    陈铭枢服人以德足推贤，伟烈丰功不让先，震耳声名今喜觌，那知醉我是慈泉。信将玉帛化干戈，掌握和平莫与科，氢弹从今真可毁，苏中保卫世同歌。
