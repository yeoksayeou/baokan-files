What kind of technical equipment should our country adopt for industrial construction now? This has recently aroused a lot of discussion.

This question was raised by some departments when discussing how to save funds and prepare the second five-year construction plan this year. It involves the country's technological policy and the way the country's human, financial and material resources are used. Therefore, it is of great significance for implementing the policy of building the country diligently and thriftily, and for increasing production and practicing economy.

On this issue, many people are overly enthusiastic about adopting "the world's most advanced," "first-class," and "automated" equipment. They believe that this is necessary and economical in the long run. But they emphasized the future, ignoring the reality, and ignoring the contradiction between future needs and current needs, and between future economy and current economy.

In recent years, our country has planned and built many enterprises with world-class technical equipment. These enterprises are the backbone of our country's industry, and they have a huge role in enhancing our country's economic and defense strength, and mastering advanced science and technology. Therefore, our country still needs to plan and focus on building such enterprises now and in the future. However, it is not appropriate to excessively pursue the construction of such enterprises at present. The most advanced equipment certainly has the advantages of high efficiency, high product quality, low cost, and fewer personnel, but such equipment requires a highly developed machinery industry to manufacture, requires more investment, and requires more construction time. However, our country's current situation is that funds are limited, a large amount of manpower needs to be utilized, and the technical level of the machinery industry is low and cannot manufacture such advanced equipment. Therefore, if we adopt the most advanced and automated equipment too much at present, on the one hand, we will need to import more equipment, and on the other hand, the production capacity of our country's machinery industry will not be fully utilized, and its technical level will not be rapidly improved. Moreover, to import more equipment, we need to export more materials to exchange for foreign exchange for imported equipment. However, our country's economic level is still very low, and the export of materials is limited. Therefore, relying too much on imported equipment for construction will inevitably limit the scale and speed of our country's construction due to insufficient foreign exchange. Therefore, some people say that simply pursuing "automation" cannot accelerate "industrialization."

Based on the experience of our country's construction in the past four years and our country's conditions, some people advocate adopting more general technical equipment in the construction in recent years. In this way, most of the equipment we need can be manufactured domestically; our country's machinery industry's production capacity can be fully utilized, and the technical level can be gradually and rapidly improved. This will also enable the construction of other departments to obtain better equipment. This proposition is realistic and positive.

In the metallurgical industry, the funds used to build a highly automated factory with an annual output of 60,000 tons of seamless steel pipes can be used to build two seamless steel pipe factories with a lower degree of automation and an annual output of more than 100,000 tons of seamless steel pipes. Its product quality can meet the needs of general industrial construction. Many seamless steel pipes abroad are produced by such factories. To build a small steel rolling workshop with an annual output of nearly 100,000 tons of steel, using the most advanced technology, the mechanized and automated auxiliary equipment in the production process accounts for 80% of the total equipment, and the main production equipment only accounts for 20%. Therefore, it costs more than twice as much money than using general technical equipment. Iron ore, refractory materials, and non-ferrous metal enterprises have the same situation. The coal and power industries also require a lot more investment to use the most advanced equipment than to use general equipment. These situations show that, in the case where we have already established some necessary enterprises with first-class equipment, to build similar enterprises, or to build those enterprises where the use of non-first-class equipment does not affect or does not greatly affect product quality, such as steel rolling mills that produce small and medium-sized steel, iron ore, as well as coal mines, coal washing plants, and general power plants, etc., using general technical equipment, the same amount of funds can be used to build more enterprises and accelerate our country's industrialization more quickly.

In recent years, our country's construction industry has purchased a lot of machinery from abroad, and the degree of industrialization and mechanization of the construction industry has greatly developed. The metallurgical industry has invested more than 400 million yuan in the construction industry in the past four years, accounting for about 10% of the department's investment during the first five-year plan period. The Ministry of Coal and Electricity Industries and the Ministry of Construction Engineering and other departments have also spent a lot of money in this regard. Most of these investments are necessary, but now some enterprises are still asking for a large increase in new equipment. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry alone will need an investment of about 300 million yuan in the next few years. The person in charge of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry believes that there are many types of construction machinery in this department that no longer need to be added, so it is possible to save the funds for building two steel plants with an annual output of more than 100,000 tons of steel. It is also entirely possible for other departments to not add a large number of mechanical equipment for construction. Didn't many projects also construct well and quickly without using more construction machinery? Moreover, for various reasons, it is not cheaper to use machinery than manpower in some projects. In particular, the equipment utilization rate of various construction enterprises is very low, and there is still great potential. Of course, the irreplaceable superiority of the high degree of industrialization and mechanization of the construction industry can save a lot of labor, but our country does not lack labor in the next few years, but has a surplus. When considering what kind of technical equipment to adopt, our country's construction industry and other industries must also proceed from the situation of our country's more than 600 million people, and make comprehensive arrangements for both industrial construction and solving the problem of labor employment.

It is also necessary to conduct specific research on what level of technology to adopt in the current construction of other industrial transportation and water conservancy departments.

Some people say that the current adoption of general technical equipment for construction will affect our country's industry from catching up with the world's advanced technical level in a considerable period of time in the future. The presentation of this issue is not comprehensive. First, catching up with the world's advanced technical level mainly refers to scientific research and industries that are of decisive significance to the transformation of the national economy, such as industries that produce heavy and precision machinery, radio industries, and instrument industries, etc., rather than all industries, let alone every enterprise. Second, the current industrial construction in our country first solves the problem of "having or not" and "more or less," and then solves the problem of "backward or advanced." We must arrange industrial construction from China's actual situation, and we cannot act based on subjective wishes. Third, whether the technical level of the industry is advanced or not is mainly not reflected in what kind of technical equipment is used for production, but is mainly reflected in the quantity, variety, and quality of the products produced. Haven't our country's enterprises with only general technical equipment also produced many new products with international standards?

After a long period of construction, we will catch up with the advanced level in the world, which is beyond doubt. At present, adopting more general technical equipment in industrial construction will accelerate the development of our country's industrial economy and technology.

    更多采用一般的技术设备
    加快我国工业建设的速度
    新华社记者　李峰
    我国工业当前应该采用怎样的技术设备来建设，近来引起了很多人的谈论。
    这个问题，是有些部门讨论今年如何节约使用资金和编制第二个五年建设计划时提出的。它涉及国家的技术政策，关系着国家的人力财力物力怎样使用，因此，它对于贯彻执行勤俭建国的方针，对于增产节约，就有极大的意义。
    在这个问题上，有不少人过分热心于采用“世界上最先进的”、“第一流的”、“自动化”的设备。他们认为，从长远来看，这样办是需要而且是经济的。但他们强调了未来，忽略了现实，忽略了将来需要和现实需要之间、将来经济和现在经济之间的矛盾。
    近年来，我国有计划地建设了很多拥有世界上头等技术设备的企业。这些企业，是我国工业的骨干，它对于增强我国经济力量和国防力量，掌握先进的科学技术，都有巨大的作用。因此，我国现在和今后仍然要有计划有重点地，建设这类企业。但当前过多地追求建设这类企业，就不适宜了。最先进的设备，固然有效率高、产品质量高、成本低、用人少等优点，但是这样的设备，需要高度发展的机械工业制造，需要更多的投资，需要更多的建设时间。而我国当前的情况则是资金有限，众多的人力有待利用，机械工业的技术水平低，不能制造这样先进的设备。因此，当前过多地采用最先进的、自动化的设备，一方面就要有更多的设备进口，另一方面，我国的机械工业的生产能力就不能充分发挥，它的技术水平也就不能迅速提高。而且要有更多的设备进口，就要有更多的物资出口，换取进口设备的外汇。可是我国的经济水平还很低，出口物资有限，因此，过多地靠进口设备来建设，就必然使我国建设的规模和速度，受到外汇不足的限制。所以有人说：单纯追求“自动化”，并不能加速“工业化”。
    根据我国前四年建设的经验和我国的条件，有些人主张在最近几年的建设中多采用一些一般的技术设备，这样，我们所需要的设备，绝大部分本国就可以制造；我国机械工业的生产能力就可以充分发挥，技术水平就可以逐步而迅速地提高。从而也使其它部门的建设获得更好的设备。这种主张，是现实的，也是积极的。
    在冶金工业中，建设一个高度自动化的年产六万吨无缝钢管的工厂，它所用的资金，用来建设自动化程度比较低的无缝钢管厂，可以建设年产十多万吨无缝钢管的两个厂。它的产品质量，可以满足一般工业等建设的需要。国外有不少无缝钢管就是这样的厂生产的。建设一个年产近十万吨钢材的小型轧钢车间，采用最先进的技术，生产过程机械化自动化的辅助设备就占全部设备的80％，主要生产设备只占20％。因此，它比采用一般技术设备，要多花一倍多的资金。铁矿、耐火材料以及有色金属企业的建设，也有同样的情况。煤炭和电力工业，用最先进的设备比用一般的设备，也要多用很多投资。这些情况说明，在我们已经建立一些必要的具有头等设备的企业的情况下，再建设同类的企业，或建设那些不用头等设备并不影响或不大影响产品质量的企业，如像生产中小型钢材的轧钢厂、铁矿，以及煤矿、洗煤厂和一般的发电厂等，采用一般的技术设备，同样多的资金，就可以建设更多的企业，更快地加速我国的工业化。
    我国的建筑业，近几年从国外购买了很多机械，建筑业的工业化和机械化的程度，有了很大的发展。冶金工业前四年用于建筑业的投资已达四亿多元，占这个部第一个五年计划期间投资的10％左右。煤炭和电力工业部及建筑工程部等部门也在这方面花了很多钱。这些投资，大部分是需要的，但现在有些企业，还要求大量的增加新的设备。单是冶金工业部，今后几年就还需要约三亿元的投资。冶金工业部负责人认为，这个部有很多种建筑机械可以不再增置，这样就有可能节约出建设两个年产十几万吨钢的钢铁厂的资金。其它部门，不再大量增置建筑用的机械设备，也同样是完全可能的。不少工程没有用更多的建筑机械，不是也建设得很好很快吗？况且由于种种原因，当前有些工程用机械比用人力并不便宜。特别是各建筑企业的设备利用率很低，还有很大的潜力。当然，建筑业高度工业化和机械化的无可代替的优越性，是可以节省很多劳动力，但我国今后几年内，劳动力不是缺乏，而是过剩。我国的建筑业和其它的工业，在考虑采用怎样的技术设备的问题上，也不能不从我国六亿多人口这个情况出发，而使工业建设和解决劳动就业问题兼顾安排。
    其它工业交通运输和水利部门，当前采用怎样的技术水平建设，也需要进行具体的研究。
    有人说，当前采用一般技术设备建设，会影响我国工业在今后相当时间内赶上世界先进的技术水平。这个问题的提出，并不是全面的。第一，赶上世界先进的技术水平，主要是指科学研究方面和对改造国民经济有决定意义的工业，如像生产重型和精密机械的工业，无线电工业和仪表工业等，而不是指一切工业，更不是指每一个企业。第二，当前我国的工业建设，首先是解决“有、无”和“多、少”的问题，而后才是解决“落后、先进”的问题。我们要从中国的实际情况出发来安排工业建设，而不能凭主观愿望办事。第三，工业技术水平的先进与否，主要不是表现在用怎样的技术设备生产，主要是表现在生产的产品数量、品种和质量。我国那些只有一般技术设备的企业，不是也制成了不少具有国际水平的新产品吗？
    经过一个较长的建设时期，我们会赶上世界上先进的水平，这是用不着怀疑的。目前在工业建设中，更多地采用一般的技术设备，就会加速我国工业经济和技术的发展。
