Springtime in an Ordinary Agricultural Cooperative

Today is Qingming Festival, and the spring plowing and sowing work in most parts of the country is entering a more intense stage around this day. On this day, we introduce to our readers some information about the production movement organized this spring by an ordinary agricultural cooperative—the Xinle Agricultural Cooperative in Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province.

Like many agricultural cooperatives across the country, this cooperative achieved great success last year, but also had many shortcomings. From this special page, everyone can see that in this vibrant spring, this cooperative has undergone new changes: their summer crop field management and spring plowing preparations have been done better than last year; cooperative cadres have "become smarter and more prudent" than last year. They have recognized the shortcomings in their work last year, analyzed the reasons for these shortcomings, and found ways to overcome them, turning last year's failures into favorable factors for striving for a bumper harvest this year. What is the method? The most fundamental thing is to rely closely on the masses, implement democratic management of the cooperative, and adhere to diligence and thrift in running the cooperative.

The labor enthusiasm of the male and female members of the Xinle Cooperative and the democratic style of the cooperative cadres are like the flowers blooming in Jiangnan these days. See how beautiful and strong these flowers are blooming! We wish them to gradually turn into plump and large fruits; at the same time, we hope that readers from all over can also draw some nutrients from here and increase some strength.

    春天，在一个普通的农业社里
    今天是清明节，全国大多数地区的春耕播种工作在这一天前后进入更紧张的阶段。在这个日子，我们向读者介绍一个普通的农业社——江苏省松江县新乐农业社今年春天组织生产运动的一些情况。
    正像全国各地许多农业社一样，这个社去年的工作有很大成绩，也有不少缺点。从这个专页上，大家可以看到，在这生机萌动的春天，这个社已经有了新的变化：他们的夏熟作物田间管理和春耕准备工作都比去年做得更好了；社干部比去年“变得聪明些稳重些了”。他们认清了去年工作中的缺点，分析了产生缺点的原因，找出了克服缺点的办法，把去年失败的经验变成了今年争取大丰收的有利因素。办法是什么？最根本的，还是紧紧依靠群众，实行民主办社，坚持勤俭办社。
    新乐社男女社员的劳动热情和社干部的民主作风，就像这些时候江南正在盛开的花朵。看这些花朵开放得多么鲜美健壮！我们预祝它们陆续变成丰满硕大的果实；同时希望各地的读者也能从这里吸取一些养份，增加一些力量。
