Xinhua News Agency, 20th Dispatch: According to TASS news, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union passed a resolution on the 19th, deciding to stop issuing state public bonds from 1958 onwards (except for the 3% freely circulated domestic lottery bonds).

The resolution also stipulates that, from the date of the announcement of this resolution, the lottery drawing and prize awarding of previously issued state public bonds will be stopped immediately, and the repayment date of these bonds will be postponed by twenty years, that is, to be repaid in equal installments over twenty years starting from 1977. The resolution points out that re-issuing larger public bonds would become a burden on residents. If smaller public bonds are issued, then this sum would be almost entirely used to pay for the prizes and principal of previously issued public bonds. Therefore, it is only possible to stop issuing public bonds by simultaneously stopping the lottery drawing and prize awarding and postponing the repayment of previously issued state public bonds. Otherwise, the state would have to delay the growth rate of industrial and agricultural production and cultural and welfare construction, which is contrary to the fundamental interests of the people.

The resolution states that, considering that the 1957 national budget stipulates that a certain income should be obtained from public bonds, and that stopping the lottery drawing and prize awarding and postponing the payment of principal cannot offset this income, therefore, the resolution believes that a public bond must be issued once this year. The total amount of this public bond is 12 billion rubles (approximately one-third of the amount of the 1956 national public bond), stipulating that lottery drawings and prize awarding will be held annually for five years from 1958 to 1962, and principal will be repaid through lottery drawings from 1959 to 1962.

The resolution then emphasizes the huge role played by the previously issued state public bonds in socialist construction.

The resolution concludes by stating that, before passing this resolution, the CPSU Central Committee and the Soviet Council of Ministers had submitted this measure, which was prepared to be implemented in the area of state public bonds, to the working people for extensive discussion, and it was approved by the vast majority of them. The resolution expresses gratitude to the working people for their warm support of the measures implemented by the Party and the government.

    苏联决定明年起停发公债
    过去发行公债的还本日期延期二十年
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社讯：苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议19日通过决议，决定从1958年起停止发行国家公债（三厘自由流通国内有奖公债除外）。
    决议同时规定，自本决议公布之日起，立即停止进行过去发行的国家公债的抽签发奖工作，而且将这些公债的还本日期延期二十年，即自1977年开始分二十年平均付还。决议指出，再发行更大的公债，就会成为居民的负担。如果发行较小数额的公债，那么这笔公债就几乎完全用于支付过去发行的公债的奖金和本金。因此，只有同时停止进行抽签发奖和延期偿还过去发行的国家公债，才有可能停止发行公债。否则，国家将不得不延缓工农业生产和文化福利建设的增长速度，而这是违背人民的根本利益的。
    决议说，考虑到1957年度国家预算规定要从公债中获得一定的收入，而停止公债抽签发奖和延期付本并不能抵偿这笔收入，因此，决议认为，今年还必须发行一次公债。这笔公债总额为一百二十亿卢布（即约为1956年国家公债数额的三分之一），规定在1958年到1962年的五年内每年抽签发奖，而从1959年到1962年抽签还本。
    决议接着强调指出了过去发行的国家公债在社会主义建设中所起的巨大的作用。
    决议最后说，在通过这项决议以前，苏共中央和苏联部长会议曾经把在国家公债方面准备实行的这项措施交给劳动人民进行广泛讨论，并且得到了绝大多数人的赞同。决议对劳动人民对党和政府所实行的措施的热烈支持，表示感谢。
