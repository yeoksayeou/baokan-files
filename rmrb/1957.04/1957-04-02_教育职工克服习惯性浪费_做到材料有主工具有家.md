Xinhua News Agency report: The Party Committee of Anshan No. 2 Mining Construction Company educated employees to overcome habitual waste, ensuring that materials on the construction site had owners and tools had homes.

Although this company had carried out several production increase and thrift campaigns relatively well in the past, the habitual waste prevalent among employees had not been improved. For example, used templates, straw mats, tools, and wire nails were casually thrown aside and left where they lay, and when needed again, they were picked up at random. This habit became natural, and no one realized it was a huge waste.

When this year's production increase and thrift plan was being formulated, the workers felt they had no direction. The Party organization's personnel conducted on-site investigations and research and discovered that the waste of dispersed materials last year amounted to more than 50,000 yuan. They immediately used this example to educate the employees, which had a great impact on everyone. From then on, some workers began to collect the materials that had been thrown away.

It is not easy to completely change an old habit. Once, the Party Secretary saw someone throwing bricks randomly on the construction site and pointed to a newly built section of the wall and asked the workers, "If someone knocks it down, what should you do?" After a moment of silence, a worker replied, "Of course, we won't let them!" The Secretary then asked, "What should the bricklayers think when they see you throwing these bricks here?" After this question, the workers understood and put the bricks back. Later, the Party organization conducted an education campaign for all workers on cherishing the fruits of other people's labor.

At the same time, several warehouses were set up on the construction site to mobilize employees to recover dispersed materials. The value of the dispersed materials recovered from the second construction site alone reached more than 80,000 yuan, many of which were materials that had previously been in short supply. In conjunction with the recovery, the company also established an on-site material management system, dividing areas, assigning responsibilities, and ensuring timely recovery. Now, most workers have overcome the habit of throwing materials away casually.

### 教育职工克服习惯性浪费  做到材料有主工具有家

    教育职工克服习惯性浪费
    做到材料有主工具有家
    据新华社讯　鞍山第二矿山建筑公司党委会教育职工克服习惯性浪费，使工地上做到了材料有主，工具有家。
    这个公司过去几次增产节约运动虽然开展得比较好，但是职工中普遍存在的习惯性浪费却未能改进。如用完了的模板、草垫、工具、洋钉等，顺手向旁边一丢，就另干新活去了，再用的时候又随手拿过来，习惯成自然，谁也意识不到这是一种巨大浪费。
    今年订增产节约计划的时候，工人们觉得没有门路，党组织的人员到现场调查研究，发现去年流散材料共浪费五万多元，就立即用这个实例向职工群众进行教育，结果对大家震动很大。从那以后，部分工人对乱丢的材料就开始收集。
    彻底改变一种老习惯很不容易。有一次党委书记在工地上又见到有人乱丢砖，就指着刚砌好的一段墙问工人：“如果有人把它推倒，你们该怎样？”一阵沉默之后，有个工人答道：“当然不让他！”书记又问：“烧砖工人看到你们把这些砖丢在这里，该怎样？”经这一问，工人们才明白了，重新把砖收了起来。以后党组织又向全体工人进行了爱护别人劳动产物的教育。
    同时，工地上设立了好几个仓库，发动职工回收流散材料。仅第二工地回收流散材料的价值就达八万多元，其中许多是过去深感缺乏的材料。与回收同时，全公司还建立了现场材料管理制度，划分区域，分工负责，及时回收。现在大部分工人随手丢材料的习惯已经克服。
