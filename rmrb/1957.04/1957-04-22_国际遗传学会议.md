    International Genetics Conference
    The "1956 International Genetics Conference" was held in Tokyo and Kyoto, Japan, from September 6 to 12, 1956.
    The conference was divided into two parts. The first part discussed "Research on the Physical and Chemical Properties of Chromosomes," including three topics: "Chromosome Structure and Mitosis," "Chromosome Chemistry," and "Cytological Examination of Cancer." The second part discussed "Various Problems in Applied Genetics," including seven topics: "Artificial Mutation," "Polyploidy," "Heterosis," "Resistance," "Quantitative Genetics," "Microorganisms and Filterable Viruses," and "Blood Type." There were also several lectures that particularly interested the scientists present. The conference was mainly conducted in English.
    More than 600 biologists from 21 countries, including the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan, attended the conference. China did not have representatives participate.
    The opening ceremony was held on the morning of September 6 at Tokyo Imperial University. Dr. Hitoshi Kihara, Director of the National Institute of Genetics of Japan, delivered the opening speech. After the opening ceremony, Dr. Beadle from the United States gave a lecture on "The Function and Structure of Genes." Beadle is the Director of the Institute of Genetics at the University of California, and he pioneered a new field of genetic biochemistry through his research on bread mold. Based on his own research and related research by others, he concluded: "Genes are one of the components of deoxyribonucleic acid." He proved that genes are not hypothetical but actually exist.
    The afternoon of the 6th was devoted to group paper presentations and discussions. It was observed that the study of genetic problems has shifted from morphological research to physiological research, and the research materials have also shifted from higher, larger organisms to lower, smaller organisms—molds, bacteria, viruses, etc.
    On the morning of the 7th, Dr. Demerec from the United States gave a lecture on his 20 years of research results on bacteria and viruses. He pointed out that in the past, people believed that the genes on chromosomes were only one form, but in fact, they can be divided into 200 forms.
    Next, Dr. Grushchenko from the Soviet Union lectured on the "Mixed Fertilization" problem. He said that by mixing the pollen of two or more plants and then scattering it on the reproductive organs of other plants for fertilization, the offspring plants would exhibit the shapes and properties of two or more paternal plants. He hoped that everyone would also conduct this experiment. The English translator for this lecture was Professor Rana from the United States.
    At the closing ceremony on the afternoon of the 12th, Dr. Verschuer from the University of Münster in West Germany gave a lecture entitled "Tuberculosis and Cancer in Twins." He said that his research proved that the heritability of the tuberculosis constitution is definite. Dr. Haldane from the University of London in the United Kingdom then gave a lecture on "Research on the Study of Recessive Mutation Lethality Caused by Irradiation of Mice with Radiation." This research will help the study of the impact of radiation on human genetics. He said that people do not immediately develop genetic disorders after being irradiated, but like a river becoming more turbid as it flows downstream, the more these people's descendants are passed down, the more terrible genetic disorders will become apparent.

    国际遗传学会议
    “1956年国际遗传学会议”，于1956年9月6日到12日在日本东京和京都举行。
    这次会议分两部分，第一部分讨论“关于染色体的物理性和化学性的研究”，包括“染色体的构造和有丝分裂”、“染色体化学”和“癌的细胞学的考察”三个题目；第二部分讨论“应用遗传学的各种问题”，包括“人工引变”、“倍数性”、“杂种优势”、“抗性”、“数量遗传”“微生物和滤过性病毒”以及“血型”七个题目。还有几次讲演，特别引起到会科学家的兴趣。会议主要使用英语进行。
    苏联、美国、英国、日本等二十一个国家的生物学家六百多人出席了这次会议。中国没有代表参加。
    会议于9月6日上午在东京帝国大学举行开幕式，日本国立遗传学研究所所长木原均博士致开幕辞。开幕式以后，由美国比多尔博士作“遗传子的作用和构造”为题的讲演。比多尔是加里佛尼亚大学遗传研究所所长，他曾经以研究面包的红霉开拓了关于遗传的生物化学的新领域。他根据自己的研究和其他人有关的研究，得出结论：“遗传子是去氧核糖核酸的构成物之一”。他证明遗传子不是假想的而是实际存在的。
    6日下午是分组宣读论文并进行讨论。从这当中看到，遗传问题已经由形态学的研究走向生理学的研究，研究材料也由高级、大型的生物移向低级、小型的生物——霉、细菌、病毒等。
    7日上午，美国德麦列兹斯博士就他二十年来对细菌和病毒的研究结果作讲演。他指出，以往人们认为染色体上的遗传子只是一种形态，而实际上可以分为二百种形态。
    接着，苏联格鲁森科博士讲演“混合受精”问题。他说，使两种以上植物的花粉混合在一起，再把它撒在其他植物的生殖器官上使受精以后，子代植物就表现了两种以上的父系植物的形状和性质。他希望大家也进行这种实验。为这个讲演担任英文翻译的是美国的拉纳教授。
    12日下午的闭幕式上，西德闵斯特大学费尔修阿博士以“双胎子的结核和癌”为题作了讲演。他说他研究证明，结核体质的遗传性是肯定的。英国伦敦大学贺尔定博士接着作了“关于使用放射线照射鼠发生劣性变异致死的研究”的讲演。这项研究将使放射线对人体遗传的影响问题的研究得到帮助。他说，人们被放射线照射以后，并不是每个人立刻就产生了遗传性障害，但是将如同河水越向下流越混浊一样，这些人的后代越向下传，会越显出可怕的遗传性障害。（金）
