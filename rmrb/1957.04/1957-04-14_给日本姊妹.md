    To Our Japanese Sisters
    Zigang
    Beijing is a city where international friends flock to. I have welcomed many foreign guests, but rarely have I felt such a surge of emotion, wanting to write something.
    This idea began this morning. As I walked out of the alley facing the morning sun, taking the bus to the office, I would usually think about the work that would begin that day, or the trivial matters of family and children; but today, I kept thinking about the welcoming banquet for the Japanese Women's Delegation to China organized by the National Women's Federation last night.
    What an intimate and lively dinner party it was! This was partly due to the enthusiasm of the hosts, led by elder sister Xu Guangping, and partly due to the frankness and sincerity of you thirty guests. Elder sister Xu said that since the comrades of the Women's Federation knew that you were departing, they had been counting the hours until your arrival every day and every moment. She also thought of the precious friendship that Lu Xun and she had encountered with some Japanese friends. She called your short and kind old leader, Kubushiro Ochiai, "sister" because she was already seventy-six years old. Old Mama Kubushiro Ochiai is the Vice President of the Christian Women's Temperance Union. She said that the entire delegation wanted to see China's construction achievements in a month, so that they could convey them back to the Japanese people. She also mentioned the power to defend world peace formed by our 600 million people plus your 90 million people. Your deputy leader, Haruno Tsuruko, although the Vice President of the Housewives Federation, was so much like a man from her clothing to her demeanor, like some of our actresses who play male roles on stage. She was so hearty, saying that as soon as they left Haneda Airport, they were looking forward to "getting to Beijing soon, getting to Beijing soon," saying that the thirty of them were as united as a family, in order to be close to and learn from the Chinese people; she was also so humorous, having brought a whistle with her in advance, to direct the guests and hosts to perform entertainment programs one by one.
    The entertainment programs were initiated by the guests. Your classical literature researcher, whose head was already gray, danced for everyone, and many people accompanied her singing; then our Li Bo also sang "Xintianyou." They sang "Tokyo-Beijing" together, and midway through, they invited our hosts to join them, holding hands, circle after circle, strolling and singing in the restaurant of the Peace Hotel. I don't understand Japanese, but I remembered the lyrics published in the first issue of "The Traveler":
    "Asian brothers, compatriots!
    We must strive for the light of Asia,
    Overcome the mad storm,
    Ignite the passion like the sun.
    Sincere friendship links Beijing and Tokyo,
    Sincere hearts link the whole world,
    We are not afraid of any obstacles,
    Holding hands tightly,
    The symbol of friendship is Beijing - Tokyo."
    Then I seemed to understand your hearts, and I also hummed along. Someone on our hosts' side took the lead in singing "Unity is Strength," and the guests also seemed very familiar with it, because the sound echoing in the hall was so vast.
    In the past few years, we have been in contact with some Japanese visitors, and we have also seen your paintings, dramas, movies, exhibitions, and translated books, and we have found that there are many things in common between us. But it was in the moment of holding hands and singing that we truly communicated our thoughts and feelings. These thirty sisters from various regions and social strata in Japan, some were as kind as grandmothers, some were so hearty that they couldn't wait to open their hearts to us all at once, and some were so gentle that they were even a bit shy. Your deputy leader said that they were not only grateful for the warm hospitality of the Chinese sisters, but also deeply moved, the meaning beyond the words.
    After the dance, the Japanese sisters found the Chinese sisters to embrace, and I was also hugged tightly by a Japanese sister, cheek to cheek. We looked at each other again and again, shook hands again and again, smiling heartily, with tears sparkling in our eyes. The language barrier was no longer important, and we only felt that the Chinese and Japanese sisters had truly come together.
    Among the guests were many journalists, broadcasters, editors, poets, and writers. People of similar professions sat together, but our common language was not only the language of our professions, not only the language of being wives and mothers, but a broader and more profound language for peace and for the future.
    I wish us that after so many setbacks, we have finally truly come together, and the symbol of friendship is "Beijing-Tokyo." (Written on the 13th in Beijing)

    给日本姊妹
    子冈
    北京是个国际朋友纷至沓来的城市。我欢迎过很多次外宾，却很少像今天这样涌起一阵思潮，想写些什么。
    这个想法是今天早上开始的。我迎着朝阳走出胡同，搭汽车到办公室去，照例我会在这段时间里想起一天将开始的工作，或是家庭儿女的琐事；但是今天，我却尽是想起昨晚全国妇联组织的欢迎日本妇女访华代表团的宴会来。
    那是一个多么亲密活泼的晚宴啊！这一半是由于以许广平大姐为首的主人方面的热情，一半也是由于你们三十位客人的坦率真诚。许大姐说，妇联同志们自从知道你们出发以后，就在每日每刻计算着到达的时辰，她并且想到了鲁迅和她曾经遇到过的某些日本朋友的可贵的友谊。她称呼你们的矮小而慈祥的老团长久布白落实为姐姐，因为她已届七十六岁高龄。久布白落实老妈妈是基督教妇女矫风会副会长，她说全团人员想在一个月里看看中国的建设成就，好回去传达给日本人民；她并且提到了我们六亿人口加上你们九千万人口形成的保卫世界和平的力量。你们的副团长春野鹤子虽是主妇联合会副会长，可是从她的服装到她的神态却多么像位男子汉，像我们某些在舞台上扮演男角色的女演员。她是多么爽朗，说一离开羽田机场，她们就盼着“快到北京、快到北京”，说她们三十人团结得像一家人一样，为的是和中国人民亲近并学习；她又是多么滑稽，预先揣了哨子在身上，为了指挥宾主一个个地演出余兴节目。
    余兴节目是由客人发起的。头上已有了白发的你们的古典文学研究家为大家跳舞，很多人伴唱；于是我们的李波也唱起“信天游”来。她们全体唱“东京——北京”，中途把我们主人招引到一块，手拉着手，一圈又一圈，在和平宾馆的餐厅里且游且唱。我不懂日语，但是我记起“旅行家”创刊号登过的歌词来：
    “亚洲的兄弟啊，同胞啊！
    我们要争取亚洲的光明，
    战胜那疯狂的暴风雨，
    燃烧起太阳般的热情。
    真诚的友谊，把北京和东京联结起来，
    真诚的心把全世界联结起来，
    我们不怕任何阻碍，
    紧紧地手握着手，
    友谊的标记是北京——东京。”
    于是我好像懂得了你们的心，也跟着哼起调子来。我们主人方面又有人领头唱起“团结就是力量”，客人们也好像很熟悉它，因为回荡在大厅里的声音那么浩大。
    这几年来我们接触了一些日本来客，也看了你们的绘画、戏剧、电影、展览会和译过来的书籍，发现彼此间共同的东西不少。但是真正和你们沟通了思想感情，还在拉手歌唱的顷刻。这来自日本各地各阶层的三十位姐妹，有的慈祥如祖母，有的爽朗得恨不得对我们一下子打开心扉，有的温柔得甚至有几分腼腆。你们的副团长说，对于中国姐妹的热心招待，不只感谢，且是感激，意在言外。
    舞罢以后，日本姐妹找了中国姐妹拥抱，我也被一位日本姐姐紧紧抱住，颊贴着颊，我们一再对看，一再握手，彼此笑得呵呵的，眼睛里闪起了泪光，语言的隔阂已经无足轻重，只觉得中日的姐妹们真的走到一起来了。
    客人之中不乏记者、广播员、编辑、诗人、作家，我们职业相类似的人坐在一起，但是我们的共同的语言不只是职业的语言，不只是作为妻子和母亲的语言，而是更广义更深刻的为了和平为了未来的语言。
    祝，我们经过了多少坎坷，终于真的走到一起来了，而友谊的标记是“北京——东京”。　（ 13日于北京）
