Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, April 2nd: Prime Minister U Nu, upon his departure from Kunming today, said to the people who came to see him off at the airport that his visit to Kunming this time has further developed the friendship between China and Burma.

He said, "I completely agree with what my good friend Premier Zhou Enlai said, that my visit to Kunming was for rest and to see my relatives and friends. Before I departed from Rangoon, I was not feeling well. Some of my friends even doubted whether I could come to Kunming to visit my relatives and friends. However, after arriving in Kunming, my illness immediately disappeared; now, my health has fully recovered."

Prime Minister U Nu said, "From the moment I arrived here, the governor of this province, the commander here, and other friends have treated me with utmost care. For the sake of Sino-Burmese friendship, I have invited the governor, the commander, and other friends here to visit Burma and celebrate the Water Splashing Festival; they have accepted my invitation."

"As far as we are concerned, in order to meet our relatives and 'pauk-phaw' (compatriots) here from time to time, I will often come to Kunming in the future. When we come in the future, we hope you will treat us casually, like relatives and 'pauk-phaw,' and have fun with us."

Prime Minister U Nu said, "As Premier Zhou Enlai just said, every time I visit China, and every time Chinese leaders visit Burma, Sino-Burmese friendship is further developed. Although I came to rest this time, from a political point of view, it is also of great help to Sino-Burmese friendship. This is a very beneficial visit."

He said, "The friendship between China and Burma began when Premier Zhou Enlai first visited Rangoon and issued a joint statement with me containing the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. And our two countries' friendship, I think, is like an English saying: 'The road of the forest is never straight'." Meaning that we will encounter certain difficulties. When we encounter difficulties, we will not be discouraged, but will definitely use some method to overcome these difficulties. We already have such a willingness to be friendly with each other and to treat each other as relatives.

Prime Minister U Nu said, "The People's Republic of China and the Union of Burma are brotherly countries. China is the elder brother, and Burma is the younger brother. I would like to take this opportunity to make a request: because Burma is the younger brother and is still young, it is inevitable that mistakes will sometimes occur during conversations or work, and sometimes there will be some rude or other kinds of errors in actions or words. If so, I hope that China can forgive us with the attitude of an elder brother. I also fully believe that China will do so."

Prime Minister U Nu also specifically mentioned the Chinese children who came to see him off. He said, "Whenever I meet my younger brothers, younger sisters, nephews, and nieces in schools, on the streets, or in parks, they all give me a very sincere welcome, which naturally generates a very friendly feeling in our hearts. Therefore, when I saw so many younger brothers, younger sisters, nephews, and nieces come to see me off today, I was very moved. We have such thoughts and want to talk to Premier Zhou Enlai about it: I would like to invite these younger brothers and sisters here to Rangoon in the future; if that is not possible, I will move to Kunming. Why am I particularly happy to see these younger brothers and sisters? There are two reasons: first, because these younger brothers and sisters are still children today, but in the future they will be the masters of the country and the leaders of the country. Second, because the feelings these younger brothers and sisters have for me are so pure, and whenever they welcome me, they move me very much. At present, the friendly relations established by the leaders of China and Burma are just beginning; and the leaders of our two countries will not have enough time to fully complete the work of Sino-Burmese friendship. To fully realize and consolidate Sino-Burmese friendship, we must rely on our younger brothers and sisters."

Prime Minister U Nu concluded by shouting, "Long live Sino-Burmese friendship!" "Long live peace!"

    吴努总理在昆明机场上的讲话
    新华社昆明2日电　吴努总理今天离开昆明时在机场上向欢送的人们说，他这次到昆明来访问，又使中缅两国的友谊得到了进一步的发展。
    他说，我完全同意我的好友周恩来总理的话，就是我这次来昆明访问，是为了休息，是为了来看我的亲戚朋友们。当我从仰光出发之前，我一直身体不好，当时我的一些朋友甚至怀疑我是不是能到昆明来看望我的亲友们。但是来到昆明之后，我的病就马上消失了；现在，我的身体已经完全恢复健康了。
    吴努总理说，从我到达这儿的时候起，这儿的省长、这儿的司令员、和其他的朋友们，对我的招待一直是无微不至的。为了中缅的友好，我已经邀请此地的省长、司令员和其他的朋友们在缅甸欢度泼水节的时候来访问；他们已经接受了我这个邀请。
    就我们来说，为了不时地会见我们在这儿的亲戚、“胞波”们，我以后还会经常到昆明来的。我们以后来到的时候，希望你们就像亲戚、“胞波”一样地很随便地和我们玩玩。
    吴努总理说，正如刚才周恩来总理所说的，每逢我到中国来访问，每逢中国领袖到缅甸来访问，中缅的友好就获得了进一步的发展。这一次我虽然是来休息的，但是从政治上来看，也是对中缅友好有很大的帮助的。这是一次很有益的访问。
    他说，中缅之间的友好，是从周恩来总理第一次访问仰光、并且和我一起发表包含五项原则的联合声明以后开始的。而我们两国的友好，我想，就像一句英国的俗话那样：“森林的道路永远不会平直的”。意思就是说，是会遇到一定的困难的。当我们碰到困难的时候，我们并不灰心，而一定会用某种方法来克服这些困难，我们之间已经有如此的愿意互相友好、互相做亲戚的感情。
    吴努总理说，中华人民共和国和缅甸联邦是兄弟国家。中国是老大哥，缅甸是小弟弟。我想利用这个机会，提出这样一个请求：因为缅甸是小弟弟，年纪还轻，无论在谈话的时候、在工作的时候，难免有时会发生错误，而且有的时候，在行动方面或言词方面，也会有些粗暴的或者其他方面的错误。假如这样，我希望中国能以老大哥的态度加以原谅。我也完全相信中国会这样的。
    吴努总理在讲话中还特别提到了欢送他的中国儿童们。他说，每逢我在学校里、街道上、在公园里遇到我的这些小弟弟、小妹妹、侄儿、侄女们的时候，他们对我都作了非常真诚的欢迎，这使我们心里也很自然地产生了一种非常友好的感情。因此，当我在今天看到这么许多的小弟弟、小妹妹、侄儿、侄女们来欢送我的时候，我心里非常感动。我们有这样的想法很想和周恩来总理谈谈：我想将来请这里的这些小弟弟、小妹妹都到仰光去；假如不行的话，我就搬到昆明来往。我看到这些小弟弟、小妹妹为什么特别高兴呢？这有两点原因：第一点，因为这些小弟弟、小妹妹们今天还是儿童，但是将来他们就将是国家的主人翁，国家的领导人。第二，因为这些小弟弟、小妹妹对我的感情是如此的纯洁，每逢他们欢迎我的时候，都使我非常感动。目前，中缅两国领导人所建立的友好关系，还是刚刚开始；而我们两国的领导人是不会有充分的时间来把中缅友好的工作完全完成的。要使中缅友好能够完全实现和巩固，还得依靠我们小弟弟、小妹妹。
    吴努总理最后并呼“中缅友好万岁！”“和平万岁！”
