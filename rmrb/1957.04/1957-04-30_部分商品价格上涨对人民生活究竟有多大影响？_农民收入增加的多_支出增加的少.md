Recently, we conducted an investigation in the Jianguo Agricultural Cooperative in the western suburbs of Beijing to understand the impact on farmers' lives after the state adjusted the prices of certain commodities in the recent period. Generally speaking, farmers support the state's increase in the purchase prices of live pigs, oil crops, etc.; they believe that it is reasonable to increase the prices of wool fabrics, high-end cigarettes, etc.; and that the increase of one jiao or a few fen per jin of pork, edible oil, and edible salt has little impact on farmers' family life.

At the discussion, some said: "Recently, some prices have risen a bit. For example, a jin of coarse salt used to be 1 jiao and 1 fen, but now it is 1 jiao and 3 fen, an increase of 2 fen; sesame oil used to be 6 jiao and 8 fen a jin, but now it is 8 jiao a jin, an increase of 1 jiao and 2 fen. However, in the past few years, the cooperative's grain yield has increased, and the prices of agricultural and sideline products have also increased recently, and the income of cooperative members from sideline businesses has also increased. With these increases and decreases, income still increases more. Therefore, everyone doesn't pay much attention to the slight price increase in oil, salt, etc."

Some said: "The state's price adjustments are very well-considered. Take our Jianguo Cooperative as an example. In the past, most cooperative members were unwilling to raise pigs. After the announcement of the increase in the purchase price of live pigs this year, cooperative members are vying for pig seedlings, and some families even want to raise two or three. Now, the whole cooperative of 361 households has raised more than 100 pigs, and the cooperative is still trying to find ways to buy pig seedlings for the cooperative members. With more pigs raised, it will not be difficult for everyone to buy meat in the future, and it is worthwhile for those who eat meat to spend a few more fen for this." Some said: "Although we farmers produce grain, we don't expect grain prices to rise. Because once grain prices rise, other things will follow. It is right that the price of grain has remained unchanged in recent years."

From the financial income and expenditure of several cooperative members' families that we visited separately, it also confirms that the recent price adjustments of certain commodities have little impact on farmers' lives; many cooperative members have increased their income because the prices of vegetables, eggs, etc. in Beijing this spring are higher than last year.

Old Granny Song Runchi gave us an account: Her family of four eats the grain distributed by the cooperative, so they don't have to spend money to buy it. This year during the Spring Festival, she slaughtered a pig that yielded 100 jin of meat, sold 50 jin, and received 7 jiao per jin. She kept 50 jin of meat for the family, and also kept the lard. Now, the preserved meat and lard have not been finished yet. The vegetables they eat are still bought from the cooperative last year, and sometimes they spend 1 jiao to buy four pieces of tofu. In addition to this, the main daily necessities that the family needs to spend money on are briquettes, sesame oil, peanut oil, coarse salt, kerosene, Green Leaf brand cigarettes or 4 jiao per jin of tobacco leaves, 1 jiao and 6 fen per bag of tea, Tiger Monkey brand matches, white sugar or brown sugar, Zhongzhi brand soap, cotton cloth, and linen and cotton thread for sewing clothes and shoes. Granny Song said with a smile: "The state takes care of us, and the prices of these things we buy have not increased much. Only sesame oil has increased by 1 jiao and 2 fen per jin, and coarse salt has increased by 2 fen per jin." According to the edible oil supply standard, Granny Song's family can buy half a jin of sesame oil and more than one jin of coarse salt per month. Adding the two items together, they only spend 9 fen more per month than before, and 1 yuan and 8 fen more per year. Adding the expense of buying about 30 jin of salt after this autumn to make soy sauce and pickled vegetables, they will spend a total of 1 yuan and 6 jiao and 8 fen more this year than last year. Last year, Granny Song received 70 yuan more than the year before in the year-end settlement. Recently, she also sold 20 jin of eggs, and received a total of 13 yuan and 2 jiao at 6 jiao and 6 fen per jin. Compared with last spring, these 20 jin of eggs were sold for more than 4 yuan, which can not only offset the increased expenses due to the price increase of edible oil and coarse salt, but also leave a surplus of two or three yuan.

The family situations of Hu Yuefeng, Zheng Dehai, and Ma Chunlai are similar to those of Granny Song Runchi's family. They rarely go to the market to buy grain and vegetables. The only things they need to spend money on are edible oil and salt, which have increased in price a little. The Green Leaf brand and Red Three Star brand cigarettes that they often smoke have not only not increased in price, but the Red Three Star brand cigarettes are even 2 fen cheaper per pack than before. Their income last year increased compared to 1955. Hu Yuefeng's family received 640 yuan at the end of last year, an increase of 100 yuan compared to 1955.

The Jianguo Cooperative has a total of 361 households, most of whom have similar family economic situations to those of Granny Song, Hu Yuefeng, and others. These families either raise pigs, chickens, or sell some vegetables. There are also about 20 families of "five guarantees" households and households in difficulty in this cooperative, who rarely raise pigs or chickens. The relief funds they receive are mainly used to buy grain and a small amount of non-staple foods. Grain prices have not risen, and the prices of non-staple foods such as oil and salt have not only not risen much, but the quantity they buy is also limited. At the same time, the amount of relief funds provided to them by the government and agricultural cooperatives is mainly determined based on their actual situation. Therefore, the lives of these people have not been affected by the rise in the prices of some commodities.

    部分商品价格上涨对人民生活究竟有多大影响？
    农民收入增加的多  支出增加的少
    杨昌凤
    最近，我们在北京西郊建国农业社就国家在最近一个时期调整了某些商品的价格以后，对农民的生活有些什么影响的问题进行了调查。总的说来，农民对国家提高生猪、油料等收购价格表示拥护；认为呢绒、高级香烟等价格调高一些是合理的；猪肉、食油、食盐等每斤涨一角或几分钱，对农民家庭生活影响不大。
    座谈会上，有的说：“近来有些物价上涨了一些，比如早先一斤大盐是一角一分，现在一斤是一角三分，涨了两分；香油一斤六角八分，现在一斤是八角，涨了一角二分。但是，这几年社里的粮食产量提高了，农副产品的价格最近也提高了一些，社员们的副业收入也增加了。这样一进一出，还是收入增加得多。所以大家对油、盐等涨一点价钱也不怎么理会。”
    有的说：“国家调整物价，是考虑得很周到的。拿我们建国社来说，过去大多数社员都不愿意养猪，今年公布提高生猪收购价格以后，社员们家家户户都争着要猪秧，有的一家还要养两只三只的。现在全社三百六十一户社员，已经养了一百多头猪，社里还正在替社员们设法买猪秧。猪养的多了，以后大家买肉就不困难了，吃肉的人为这个多花几分钱，也是合算的。”有的说：
  “别看我们农民生产粮食，可是我们并不盼粮食涨价。因为粮价一涨，别的东西都要跟着涨。这几年粮食的价钱一直没动是对的。”
    从我们分别访问的几户社员的家庭经济收支情况看，也证实了最近期间的某些商品价格调整对农民生活影响不大；许多社员因为今年春天北京蔬菜、鸡蛋等价格比去年高，而增加了收入。
    宋润池老大娘给我们算了一笔账：她一家四口人，吃的粮食是社里分的，不用花钱买。今年春节的时候自己宰了一头出肉一百斤的猪，卖了五十斤，每斤七角钱。家里留了五十斤肉，猪油也留下了。现在腌肉和猪油都还没有吃完。吃的菜还是头年从社里买来的，有时也花一角钱买四块豆腐吃。除此以外，家庭日常生活主要用品需要花钱买的有煤球、香油、花生油、大盐、煤油、绿叶牌香烟或四角钱一斤的烟叶，一角六分钱一袋的茶叶、虎猴牌火柴、白糖或红糖、中植牌肥皂、棉布和缝衣作鞋的麻线、棉线等。宋大娘笑着说：“国家照顾我们，我们买的这些东西都没怎么涨钱。只有香油一斤涨了一角二分，大盐一斤涨了两分。”宋大娘家按照食油供应标准一个月可以买半斤香油，一斤多大盐。两项加起来，每月只比过去多花九分钱。一年多花一元零八分。再把今年秋后准备买三十来斤盐，作酱和腌咸菜的这项支出算上，今年一年比去年总共多支出一元六角八分。去年年终决算时宋大娘比前年多分了七十元。最近她还卖了二十斤鸡蛋，每斤六角六，一共收入了十三元二角，同去年春天比，这二十斤鸡蛋就多卖了四元多，不但可以抵消因食油、大盐涨价而增加的支出，而且还可剩余两、三元。
    胡越峰、郑德海、马春来的家庭情况也和宋润池老大娘家差不多。吃的粮食、蔬菜很少到市场上去买。要用钱买的，也就是食油和盐涨了点钱。他们常抽的绿叶牌和红三星牌的香烟，不但没有涨价，红三星牌的香烟每盒还比过去落了两分钱。他们去年的收入都比1955年有增加。胡越峰家去年年底分到六百四十元，比1955年增加了一百元。
    建国社全社有三百六十一户，其中绝大多数的人家同宋大娘、胡越峰等几家的家庭经济情况不相上下。这些家庭，不是养猪的，就是养鸡的，或者是有一些蔬菜卖的。这个社里也有二十来家五保户和困难户，他们很少养猪或喂鸡。他们拿的救济款主要是买粮食和少数副食品。粮食没有涨价，油、盐等副食品不但涨的不多，而且他们买的数量也有限。同时，政府和农业社发给他们的救济款的数目，主要是根据他们的实际情况来决定。所以，这些人的生活也没有因为有些商品涨价而受到影响。
