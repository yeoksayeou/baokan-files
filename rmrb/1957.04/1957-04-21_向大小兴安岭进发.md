In the Heilongjiang Province region, where the ice is just beginning to thaw, geological survey and exploration personnel are setting out for the field one after another. Among them, the Sanhe Geological Exploration Team, stationed in the western part of the Greater Khingan Mountains, began work as early as February, while the area was still covered in ice and snow. In order to provide the state with information about mineral deposits as soon as possible, they braved the severe cold of around minus 30 degrees Celsius to conduct drilling, pit exploration, and trench exploration in work sheds and in the field. The largest Greater Khingan Regional Geological Survey Team, composed of more than 600 people, is also being assisted by Soviet geological experts. This team will complete the geological survey of 56,000 square kilometers and the general survey of more than 87,000 meters this year.

    向大小兴安岭进发
    在刚刚解冻的黑龙江省地区，地质普查勘探人员正陆续向野外出发。其中住在大兴安岭西部的三河地质勘探队，早在冰天雪地的2月间就开始了工作。为尽早给国家提供矿藏情况，他们冒着摄氏零下三十度左右的严寒，在工棚内和野外进行钻探、坑探和槽探。一支由六百多人组成的规模最大的大兴安岭区域地质测量大队，还有苏联地质专家帮助。这个大队今年将要完成五万六千平方公里的地质测量和八万七千多公尺的普查任务。
