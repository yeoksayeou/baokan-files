Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 8th: The famous Jinhua Buddha's Hand citron is planned to produce more than 50,000 pots this year.

　　Anshi Township, Jinhua County, is rich in Buddha's Hand citrons. Besides being appreciated, Buddha's Hand is also a Chinese medicinal material. In recent years, due to neglecting the production of Buddha's Hand, the output has decreased from more than 60,000 pots to about 30,000 pots, resulting in a temporary stockout on the market. Last year, the Jinhua County People's Committee accepted the opinions of the masses and took measures, and recently allocated 40,000 jin of cake fertilizer to supply farmers to cultivate Buddha's Hand seedlings, thereby increasing the enthusiasm of flower-growing farmers for production. They are actively cultivating Buddha's Hand seedlings.

    金华佛手将增产
    新华社杭州8日电　著名的金华佛手，今年计划生产五万多盆。
    金华县安狮乡盛产佛手。佛手除了可以供人欣赏外，还是一种中药材。近年来，由于忽视佛手的生产，产量由原来的六万多盆减少到三万盆左右，以致市场上一度脱销。去年，金华县人民委员会接受群众意见，采取措施，最近又调拨了四万斤饼肥，供应农民培育佛手苗木，因此提高了种花农民的生产积极性。他们正在积极地培育佛手苗木。
