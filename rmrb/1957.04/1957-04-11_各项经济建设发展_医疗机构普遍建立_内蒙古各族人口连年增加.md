Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, April 9th (Xinhua News Agency reporter Liao Youbin): In the ten years since the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the Mongolian population has increased by more than 200,000. The average annual population growth rate has increased from 5 per thousand ten years ago to 20 per thousand. The population of the Oroqen ethnic group living in the Greater Khingan Mountains and the Daur and Solon ethnic groups living in the border mountainous areas has also increased by more than 20% compared with before liberation. The Manchu, Hui, Korean, and other minority ethnic groups within the autonomous region are also experiencing population prosperity. The Korean population has increased by more than 30% compared with ten years ago; the population of the Manchu and Hui and other minority ethnic groups has also increased by more than 20%.

The development of various economic constructions in the autonomous region and the universal establishment of medical institutions have played a major role in the population growth of various minority ethnic groups in the autonomous region. Venereal diseases, which had been affecting the decline of the Mongolian population since the late Qing Dynasty, have stopped developing since last year due to the expansion of treatment areas, the reduction of infection scope, and free treatment for patients living in poverty. To date, more than 110,000 venereal disease patients have been treated. The mortality rate of measles, which has been prevalent among children in pastoral areas for many years, has also dropped from over 10% in 1950 to just over 1% last year. Keshan disease, which has spread in Daur and other minority ethnic areas, has seen a 54% decrease in the number of cases since active prevention and treatment began in 1953. In addition, with the development of various production and mutual aid cooperative organizations throughout the region, some pastoral areas and hunting areas have begun to settle down, creating good conditions for infant birth and growth. More than 80% of these areas now promote modern midwifery, reducing the infant tetanus mortality rate from 53% in 1950 to just over 1% last year.

Due to the improvement of the people's lives and the prevention and treatment of diseases, the fertility rate of women has increased significantly. In a survey of more than 1,100 women of childbearing age in Chen Barag Banner and Solon Banner this year, an average of more than nine women gave birth to one infant in 1948; after the launch of venereal disease treatment work, one infant has been born for every four women since last year. In the Xilin Gol Grassland, where the Mongolian population has been declining sharply for decades, the Mongolian population (including a small number of immigrants) totaled more than 55,000 last year, an increase of more than 30% compared with before the establishment of the autonomous region. Among them, the newly added infants and young children under the age of six numbered more than 10,000. The infant mortality rate has dropped from 318 per thousand in 1952 to 109 per thousand.

    各项经济建设发展　医疗机构普遍建立
    内蒙古各族人口连年增加
    新华社呼和浩特9日电　新华社记者廖由滨报道：在内蒙古自治区成立十年中，蒙古族人口增加二十多万人。平均每年人口增长率由十年前的千分之五提高到千分之二十。居住在大兴安岭林区的鄂伦春族以及居住在边沿山区的达呼尔族和索伦族，人口也比解放前增加20％以上。自治区境内的满、回、朝鲜等少数民族也都人口兴旺。朝鲜族人口比十年前增加30％多；满族和回族等少数民族人口，也增加20％以上。
    自治区各项经济建设的发展，医疗机构的普遍建立，对自治区各少数民族人口增长起了重大作用。从清代末年起就影响蒙古族人口下降的性病，由于扩大治疗面积，缩小感染范围，并且对生活贫困的患者进行免费治疗，去年起便停止了发展。到目前止，受到治疗的性病患者有十一万多人。历年来流行在牧区儿童中的麻疹，死亡率也由1950年的10％强下降到去年的1％强。蔓延在达呼尔等少数民族地区的克山病，经积极防治以后，现在发病人数已经比1953年下降54％。此外，随着全区各项生产和互助合作组织的发展，一些牧业地区和猎区开始定居生活，对婴儿生育和生长也创造了良好条件。现在这些地区已有80％以上推行了新法接生，使婴儿破伤风死亡率由1950年的53％下降到去年的1％强。
    由于各族人民的生活改善和疾病的防治，妇女生育率有了显著提高。今年调查的陈巴尔虎旗和索伦旗的一千一百多个在生育年龄的妇女中，1948年平均每九个多妇女才生一个婴儿；开展性病治疗工作以后，从去年起每四个妇女就生一个婴儿。几十年来蒙古族人口急剧下降的锡林郭勒草原，去年蒙古族人口（包括小部分迁入的人口）共有五万五千多人，比自治区成立前增加30％多。其中新增加的六岁以下的婴儿和幼儿，就有一万多人。婴儿死亡率已由1952年的千分之三百一十八下降到千分之一百零九。
