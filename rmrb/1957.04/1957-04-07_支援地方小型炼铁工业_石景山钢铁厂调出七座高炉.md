    Supporting Local Small-Scale Iron Smelting Industry
    Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Transfers Seven Blast Furnaces
    Xinhua News Agency, 6th – The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has decided to transfer seven small blast furnaces that have been out of production for many years to industrial departments in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Hunan, Shanxi and other regions to support the development of local small-scale iron smelting industries.  Once all seven small blast furnaces are restored, they can produce more than 100,000 tons of pig iron annually.

    Currently, two small blast furnaces have been dismantled and will soon be shipped to Hang County, Zhejiang. The remaining five small blast furnaces are also being dismantled or prepared for dismantling, and are expected to be completely dismantled and shipped by the end of July.

    According to sources, Zhejiang, Jiangsu and other provinces have many small iron mines.  Once the small blast furnaces are restored, they can use local materials and sell locally, meeting part of the local industrial needs for pig iron.  The industrial departments of these provinces have initially formulated plans to restore the small blast furnaces and prepare to put them into production successively in the next two years.

    支援地方小型炼铁工业
    石景山钢铁厂调出七座高炉
    新华社6日讯　石景山钢铁厂决定把停产多年的七个小高炉移交给浙江、江苏、湖南、山西等地工业部门，支援地方发展小型炼铁工业。这七个小高炉全部修复起来，每年可以生产十万吨以上的生铁。
    目前，已有两个小高炉拆卸完毕，不久将运往浙江杭县。其余五个小高炉也正在拆卸或准备拆卸，预计在7月底将全部拆完启运。
    据记者自有关方面了解，浙江、江苏等省都有不少小型铁矿，将小高炉修复以后，可以就地取材，就地销售，满足当地地方工业一部分生铁的需要。这些省的工业部门，已经初步制订出修复小高炉的计划，准备在今明两年陆续投入生产。
