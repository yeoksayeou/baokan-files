In the 1942 Rectification Movement, our Party put forward the formula of "Unity—Criticism—Unity" for conducting inner-Party struggle. That is to say, in order to resolve differences of opinion among comrades, we should proceed from the desire for unity, go through criticism or struggle, and achieve new unity on a new basis. Practice since the Rectification Movement, especially in recent years, has proved that this formula can be applied not only within the Party but also outside the Party, becoming a basic method for handling contradictions among the people.

Contradictions among the people are issues of right and wrong. Resolving contradictions among the people is to distinguish right from wrong and enhance unity, not to eliminate or overthrow one side of the contradiction as in the struggle between ourselves and the enemy. Therefore, within the people, such as between the people and the government, between different sections of the people, between superiors and subordinates in Party and state organs, between individuals and collectives, and between Party members and non-Party members, the method of criticism and self-criticism can be used to resolve differences of opinion and conflicts of interest, and to overcome shortcomings and errors in work.

Criticism should become a habit. In Party life, in people's congresses and political consultative conferences at all levels, within state organs, in the daily contact between Party and state workers at all levels and the people, and among the people themselves, criticism and self-criticism should be more active. Within the people, anyone can criticize others, and any organization or group must accept correct criticism. None of our Party organizations and state organs, none of our workers, regardless of their position, age, merit, seniority, or performance, have any privilege or reason to resist criticism. Measures should be taken to expand democratic life so that everyone has the opportunity to criticize things they are not satisfied with. In our society, state organs, and even Party organizations, we need to foster an atmosphere where criticism and self-criticism are seen as indispensable as washing one's face and cleaning every day. We should not think that only those who are bad in all aspects, or bad people and bad things, should be criticized. We should not be overly nervous when faced with criticism, especially public criticism, so that everyone looks askance at the criticized, and the criticized feel unable to hold their head up and face others for a long time. This atmosphere is not conducive to carrying out criticism.

Some comrades have different views on whether criticism is beneficial for handling contradictions among the people. They fear that criticism will sharpen and complicate internal contradictions and put the Party, the government, or the leadership in a passive position. Is this really the case? Take the example of how to deal with bureaucratic work style. Bureaucracy is often an important factor in forming internal contradictions. Where there is bureaucracy, there will inevitably be popular dissatisfaction. If the leading organs promote democracy and support the people's criticism of bureaucracy, it may seem that contradictions are indeed becoming tense and sharp in a certain period of time. The masses are very angry with those who have a bureaucratic work style, and a large number of opinions are raised. Many, many problems are immediately presented to the leaders, and the leadership inevitably feels some difficulties and passivity for a while. In fact, the contradiction has not become sharper, but it has become apparent. When the contradiction becomes apparent and the problems are all brought out, you have to solve them, which is a necessary condition for solving the problem, a good thing rather than a bad thing. Leaders will gain greater initiative after being passive. Of course, when criticizing serious shortcomings and errors, the prestige of some Party organizations and state organs may be affected, but this is nothing to be afraid of. As long as the Party organizations and state organs accept correct criticism and earnestly correct shortcomings and errors, the masses will see the Party and the government's high degree of seriousness and responsibility towards the people's cause. At this time, the prestige of the Party and the government will not be reduced but will be further enhanced and consolidated. Conversely, if we do not support the people's criticism of bureaucratic tendencies, the problems will not be revealed for a certain period of time, and everyone may seem to be at peace on the surface. However, if the masses are suppressed for a long time and cannot express their correct opinions and reasonable demands, they will use irrational and excessive behavior to oppose bureaucracy when they can no longer tolerate it, and even demand solutions to certain problems that cannot be solved temporarily. At this time, the contradiction truly becomes sharp and complicated, and the leaders will inevitably be in a more passive and difficult situation. It should be seen that since contradictions and disagreements exist objectively, no one can obliterate or cover them up. If we do not face them squarely and insist on concealing them, the result will inevitably be that the contradictions and disagreements will become deeper and sharper. In our actual life, we can find many such lessons.

Not every kind of criticism is conducive to handling contradictions among the people. Only comradely, realistic criticism proceeding from the desire for unity can truly help distinguish right from wrong and enhance unity, and can truly become a driving force for the advancement of our cause.

The purpose of carrying out criticism is to clarify right and wrong and unite comrades, not to fix someone. Therefore, whoever criticizes others should be full of the spirit of curing diseases and saving people, and being kind to others. Within our Party, we advocate treating comrades who have made mistakes with a correct attitude, and advocate extending a hand to comrades who have stumbled. We should not only wait for him to correct his mistakes from the sidelines, but also actively and patiently help him to correct his mistakes, and welcome and encourage every small progress he makes. The same spirit should be applied to criticism among the people. When criticizing others, we should consider how to prepare conditions for the criticized to correct their mistakes, and should not intentionally make others unable to step down. It is even more impermissible to use the attitude of beating errors within the people to death with one blow, and to treat contradictions within the people. Some comrades sometimes ignore this issue, especially when they think that the shortcomings and errors of the criticized are relatively serious, they will give the erring a "cruel struggle, ruthless blow"; even when the erring comrades express their desire for repentance and hope to get help and support, they still do not use a comradely attitude to help these comrades, so that these comrades lose the confidence and courage to correct their mistakes. This is very detrimental to the cause of the people.

Special attention should be paid to preventing the weapon of criticism from being used by sectarianists. Criticism should have been intended to proceed from the desire for unity and achieve the goal of unity. Some sectarianists, however, use criticism to attack and exclude comrades who hold different views from themselves or have personal grudges. Some people even use criticism as a tool for personal unprincipled disputes. When these people criticize others, they certainly do not talk about the desire for unity and a comradely attitude, but are only afraid of not being able to fix people, and are afraid that the other party can correct their mistakes well. Such criticism will not only fail to clarify right and wrong and enhance unity, but will also confuse right and wrong and undermine unity. In the history of our Party, there have been many such lessons. The formula of "Unity—Criticism—Unity" was developed by Marxists within the Party in the process of fighting against some sectarianists, and became a powerful weapon against sectarianists who use criticism to undermine unity. This experience is worth remembering by the people of the whole country.

The leaders of Party organizations, state organs and enterprises today need first of all to encourage and help the masses to make full use of the weapon of criticism. We advocate that criticism should proceed from the desire for unity in order to develop criticism correctly and to achieve the goal of better unity, not to be used as a shield to restrict criticism. For various reasons, there will inevitably be some extreme and excessive parts in criticisms, and critics may sometimes be rude in attitude and poor in method, which may seem not to meet the standard of proceeding from unity. However, as long as it is not sectarianists or bad elements with ulterior motives using criticism to stir up trouble and slander, the leaders should clearly adopt a protective attitude towards the critics. First of all, we must protect their enthusiasm for making suggestions and accept the correct parts of the suggestions. Even if there are a few extreme and excessive opinions, do not immediately fly into a rage. We should guide criticism to develop in the right direction, and educate the masses to gradually recognize the mistakes of one-sidedness, but we should not obliterate the reasonable elements and positive roles of those one-sided opinions. That is to say, we should use comprehensiveness to deal with one-sidedness, and not use one-sidedness to deal with one-sidedness. "The speaker is not guilty, the listener should take heed" should be our motto. The more the leaders adopt an attitude of protecting the enthusiasm of the masses, the more they will be able to guide the masses onto the right path, and the more the leaders and the masses will be able to unite solidly.

### 从团结的愿望出发

    从团结的愿望出发
    1942年整风运动中，我们党提出了“团结——批评——团结”这一进行党内斗争的公式，这就是说，为了解决同志间的意见分歧，应该从团结的愿望出发，经过批评或斗争，在新的基础上达到新的团结。经过整风运动以后特别是最近几年的实践证明，这一公式不但可以用于党内，而且可以用于党外，成为处理人民内部矛盾的基本方法。
    人民内部矛盾是是非问题，解决人民内部矛盾是为了明辨是非，增强团结，而不是像进行敌我之间的斗争那样，要消灭或打倒矛盾的一方。因此，在人民内部，例如在人民群众和政府之间、这一部分和那一部分人民群众之间、党和国家机关中的上下级之间、个人和集体之间、党和非党之间，都可以用开展批评和自我批评的办法，来解决各种不同意见的分歧和不同利益的冲突，克服工作中的缺点和错误。
    要使批评成为习惯。在党的生活中，在各级人民代表大会和政治协商会议上，在国家机关内部，在各级党和国家工作人员和人民群众的日常接触中以及人民群众之间，批评和自我批评都应该更加活跃起来。在人民内部，任何人都可以批评别人，任何人任何机关团体也都要接受正确的批评。我们的任何党组织和国家机关，我们的任何工作人员，不论他们的职位高低、年龄老少、功劳大小、资历深浅、工作成绩好坏，谁都没有任何特权任何理由可以抗拒批评。应该采取各种措施扩大民主生活，使人人都有机会对自己不满意的事情提出批评。在我们的社会上、国家机关以至党组织中，都需要形成这样一种风气：把批评和自我批评看成像每天洗脸每天打扫卫生一样，是日常生活中不能一日或缺的事情。不要认为只有各方面都很不好的人，或者是坏人坏事才应当受批评，不要一遇到批评特别是公开的批评就过分紧张起来，大家对被批评者侧目而视，被批评者更觉得长期抬不起头见不得人。这种风气不利于开展批评。
    批评是否有利于处理人民内部矛盾，有些同志有不同的看法。他们害怕批评会使内部矛盾尖锐起来复杂起来，会使党和政府或领导方面处于被动地位。事实是不是真的如此？以如何对待官僚主义作风为例。官僚主义常常是形成内部矛盾的一个重要因素。既有官僚主义，必然会引起群众不满。领导机关如果发扬民主，支持群众对官僚主义的批评，在一定的时间内看起来，的确矛盾是紧张尖锐起来了。群众对有官僚主义作风的人非常愤慨，提出了大堆意见，很多很多问题一下摆到领导者的面前，领导工作一时也不免感到一些困难和被动。实际上，矛盾并没有更加尖锐，不过是表面化了。矛盾表面化了，问题都摆出来了，你就非去解决不可，这正是解决问题的必要条件，是好事而不是坏事。领导者在被动之后就会取得更大的主动。当然，对严重的缺点和错误进行批评的时候，某些党组织和国家机关的威信是可能受到影响的，但是这也没有什么可怕。只要党组织和国家机关接受正确的批评，认真改正缺点和错误，群众就会从这里看到党和政府对人民事业的高度的严肃负责态度，这时候党和政府的威信就不是降低而是更加提高和巩固了。相反地，如果不支持群众对官僚主义倾向进行批评，在一定的时间内，问题没有揭开来，大家在表面上似乎可以相安无事。可是，群众长期受到压制不能提出自己的正确意见和合理要求，一旦到了不能容忍的时候，他们就会用不冷静的过火的行为去反对官僚主义，甚至要求解决某些一时不能解决的问题。这时候，矛盾真正尖锐化复杂化了，领导者也必然处于更被动更困难的境地。应该看到，矛盾和分歧既然在客观上存在，就谁也抹煞和掩盖不了。不正视它们，硬要掩饰它们，其结果必然是矛盾和分歧越来越加深越来越尖锐。在我们的实际生活中，可以找到很多这样的教训。
    并不是任何一种批评都有利于处理人民内部矛盾。从团结的愿望出发的同志式的实事求是的批评，才真正有助于分清是非，增强团结，才真正能够成为我们事业前进的推动力量。
    开展批评的目的是为了弄清是非、团结同志，而不是为了整那一个人。因此，无论谁在批评别人的时候，都应该满怀治病救人、与人为善的精神。在我们党内，提倡用正确的态度对待犯错误的同志，提倡向摔了跤的同志伸出手来，不但从旁等待他改正错误，而且要积极地和耐心地帮助他改正错误，欢迎和鼓励他的每一个微小的进步。在人民内部同样应当本着这种精神开展批评。在批评别人的时候，要考虑到怎样为被批评者改正错误准备条件，而不要有意地整得别人下不得台，更不允许用一棍子打死的态度去批评人民内部的错误，对待人民内部的矛盾。有些同志有时候忽略了这个问题，特别是当他们认为被批评者的缺点和错误比较严重的时候，他们就要给犯错误者以“残酷斗争，无情打击”；甚至当犯错误的同志表示了悔改的愿望，希望得到帮助和支持的时候，他们也仍然不用同志式的态度去帮助这些同志，以致使这些同志失掉改正错误的信心和勇气。这对于人民的事业是很不利的。
    要特别注意防止批评这一武器被宗派主义者利用。批评本来应当是从团结的愿望出发，达到团结的目的。有些宗派主义者却利用批评去打击排斥跟自己持不同见解或者有个人嫌隙的同志。有些人甚至把批评用做个人之间闹无原则纠纷的工具。这些人在批评别人的时候，当然谈不到团结的愿望和同志式的态度，而是唯恐整不倒人，唯恐对方能够很好地改正错误。这样的批评不仅不会弄清是非，增强团结，还要混淆是非，破坏团结。在我们党的历史上，曾经有过不少这样的教训。而“团结——批评——团结”的公式，也正是党内的马克思主义者在同某些宗派主义者进行斗争的过程中发展起来，成为反对宗派主义者利用批评破坏团结的有力武器的。这个经验，值得全国人民记取。
    党组织、国家机关和企业的领导者，今天首先需要鼓励和帮助群众充分地使用批评武器。我们提倡批评从团结的愿望出发，是为了正确地发展批评，是为了达到更好的团结的目的，并不是为了用来作限制批评的挡箭牌。由于种种原因，批评意见中总不免有一些偏激过火的部分，批评者有时也会态度粗暴，方式不好，看起来似乎不合乎从团结出发的标准。但是，只要不是宗派主义者或别有用心的坏分子利用批评进行挑拨和污蔑，领导者对批评者就应该明确地采取保护态度。首先要保护他们提意见的积极性，接受意见中的正确部分。即使有少数偏激过火的意见，也不要马上暴跳如雷。我们应该引导批评向正确的方面发展，教育群众逐渐认识片面性的错误，但是对于那些片面性意见中的合理的成分和积极的作用，也不要一笔抹煞。这就是说，要用全面性去对待片面性，而不要用片面性去对待片面性。言者无罪，闻者足戒，应该是我们的座右铭。领导者愈是采取保护群众积极性的态度，他们就愈能够引导群众走上正确的道路，而领导者和群众也就愈能够巩固地团结一致。
