Two Years of the Asian-African Conference

Two years ago today (April 18, 1955), the historically significant Asian-African Conference opened in Bandung, Indonesia. Participating in this conference were the five initiating countries of India, Indonesia, Burma, Pakistan, and Ceylon, as well as representatives from twenty-nine Asian and African countries, including China, Egypt, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and Japan. The conference lasted seven days and unanimously adopted the "Final Communiqué of the Asian-African Conference," solemnly "declaring that colonialism in all its manifestations is an evil that should be swiftly eradicated." The communiqué also established ten principles as the basis for promoting international peace and security: respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all nations, equality of all races and nations large and small, non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, non-aggression against other countries, and peaceful resolution of all international disputes.

Since the Asian-African Conference, the "Bandung Spirit," characterized by upholding and striving for independence, peaceful coexistence, and friendly unity, has been increasingly promoted.

In the past two years, Sudan, Morocco, Tunisia, and Ghana have shaken off the shackles of colonialism and declared independence. Togo has declared itself an autonomous republic. Singapore will implement internal autonomy within the British Commonwealth. The struggles of the people of Algeria, Cyprus, Kenya, Uganda, and Malaya for national liberation have become even more intensified.

The glorious victory of the Egyptian people in defending their sovereignty and resisting Anglo-French armed aggression is a significant development in the anti-colonialist struggle after the Asian-African Conference. Other Asian and African countries have also achieved many successes in consolidating their independence and eliminating colonialist forces. In February 1956, Indonesia declared that it was not bound by the financial and economic agreements and other agreements concluded with the Netherlands at the Round Table Conference, and then in August, it announced that it did not recognize or repay the debts unreasonably stipulated by the Netherlands based on the Round Table Conference. In March 1956, Jordan expelled Glubb Pasha, the British commander of the Arab Legion, and in November, it terminated the Anglo-Jordanian Treaty and abolished British military bases in Jordan. Libya also recovered bases from France in December 1956. Britain was forced to agree to return the Trincomalee base to Ceylon in 1957. The struggles of India to recover Goa and Indonesia to recover West Irian continue unremittingly.

The status and role of the Asian-African group in the United Nations are increasingly strengthened. With the joint efforts of the Asian-African group and the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, the tenth and eleventh sessions of the United Nations General Assembly repeatedly broke through the obstruction of colonialist countries, discussed issues of maintaining peace and national self-determination, and achieved some major successes.

The political, economic, and cultural ties between Asian and African countries have greatly developed. Contacts between leaders of various countries have become more frequent, promoting mutual understanding and friendly cooperation. In order to oppose imperialist aggression, the unity between Arab national independent countries has been continuously strengthened. Based on the principles of peaceful coexistence, China's friendly and cooperative relations with Asian and African countries have been developing day by day. After the Asian-African Conference, many leaders of Asian and African countries visited China. Premier Zhou Enlai also visited Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Burma, Cambodia, Afghanistan, Ceylon, and Nepal. Egypt, Syria, Yemen, and Ceylon have established diplomatic relations with China. Cambodia's relations with China have become even closer. China's friendly relations with Japan are also constantly increasing.

The trend of peace and neutrality has developed even more in the Asian-African region in the past two years. In the 1956 Ceylon parliamentary elections, the People's United Front, led by Bandaranaike, won a victory. The new government adopted a series of measures to ensure that Ceylon develops along the path of peace, neutrality, and independence. In August 1956, the delegation of the Royal Lao Government and the delegation of the Lao Fighting Units reached an agreement. Both parties agreed to implement a policy of peace and neutrality, not to participate in any military blocs, and decided to organize a coalition government with the participation of the Lao Fighting Units, which will enable Laos to embark on the road of peaceful reunification. Cambodia also adheres to independence and the Five Principles, greatly enhancing its international status. Even in the Philippines and Thailand, which participated in the Manila Treaty and the Baghdad Pact, the voices calling for breaking free from the shackles of military blocs and opposing American control are rising.

The development of friendly and cooperative relations between Asian and African countries and the expansion of the peaceful region in the past two years are not pleasing to imperialism. The imperialist bloc, headed by the United States, continues to strengthen military blocs, engage in division, subversion, and aggression in the Asian-African region. The United States has become the most vicious enemy of the Asian and African people. It is pursuing the "Eisenhower Doctrine" in the Middle East, attempting to use military pressure, economic bait, sowing discord, and subversive activities to achieve the goal of controlling and enslaving the countries of this region. However, as long as the people of Asian and African countries strengthen their unity and vigilance, the sinister conspiracies of the colonialists will surely be shattered. (Yihan)

    亚非会议两周年
    两年前的今天（1955年4月18日），具有历史意义的亚非会议在印度尼西亚的万隆开幕了。参加这次会议的有印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、巴基斯坦和锡兰五个发起国，以及中国、埃及、越南民主共和国和日本等二十九个亚非国家的代表。会议举行了七天，一致通过了“亚非会议最后公报”，严正地“宣布殖民主义在其一切表现中都是一种应当迅速予以根除的祸害”。公报并确定了一切国家主权和领土完整、一切种族和大小国家平等、不干涉他国内政、不侵略别国和以和平方式解决一切国际争端的十项原则，作为促进国际和平和安全的基础。
    亚非会议以后，以维护和争取独立、和平共处和友好团结为特征的“万隆精神”，日益发扬光大。
    两年来，苏丹、摩洛哥、突尼斯、加纳挣脱了殖民主义的枷锁，宣布了独立。多哥宣布成为自治共和国。新加坡将在英联邦范围内实行内部自治。阿尔及利亚、塞浦路斯、怯尼亚、乌干达和马来亚人民争取民族解放的斗争，更加高涨。
    埃及人民在维护自己的主权和抗击英法武装侵略方面所取得的光辉胜利，是亚非会议后反殖民主义斗争的重大发展。亚非其他国家在巩固独立和肃清殖民主义势力方面也获得许多成就。印度尼西亚于1956年2月声明不受在圆桌会议上同荷兰缔结的财政经济协定和其他协定的约束，接着又在8月间宣布不承认和不偿还荷兰根据圆桌会议无理规定的债务。约旦在1956年3月赶走了阿拉伯军团英国司令格拉布，并于11月结束了英约条约，撤销了英国在约旦的军事基地。利比亚在1956年12月也从法国手中收回了基地。英国被迫同意在1957年内把亭可马里基地交还给锡兰。印度要求收复果阿和印度尼西亚要求收复西伊里安的斗争，坚持不懈。
    亚非集团在联合国的地位和作用，日益加强。在亚非集团同苏联和其他社会主义国家的共同努力下，第十届和第十一届联合国大会一再冲破了殖民主义国家的阻挠，讨论了维护和平和民族自决权的问题，并取得了一些重大成就。
    亚非各国之间在政治、经济和文化方面的联系，有了很大的发展。各国领导人之间的接触日益频繁，促进了相互谅解和友好合作关系。为了反对帝国主义的侵略，阿拉伯民族独立国家之间的团结不断加强。根据和平共处的原则，我国同亚非各国的友好合作关系日益发展。在亚非会议以后，许多亚非国家的领导人访问了我国。周恩来总理也访问了印度尼西亚、印度、巴基斯坦、缅甸、柬埔寨、阿富汗、锡兰和尼泊尔。埃及、叙利亚、也门和锡兰同我国建立了外交关系。柬埔寨同我国的关系更加密切。我国同日本的友好关系，也不断增进。
    和平中立的趋势，两年来在亚非地区有了更大的发展。在1956年的锡兰议会选举中，以班达拉奈克为首的人民联合阵线取得了胜利，新政府采取了一系列措施，保证锡兰沿着和平中立和独立的道路发展。老挝王国政府代表团和寮国战斗部队代表团在1956年8月达成了协议，双方一致赞成执行和平中立政策，不参加任何军事集团，并决定组织有寮国战斗部队参加的联合政府，从而将使老挝走上和平统一的道路。柬埔寨也坚持独立自主和五项原则，大大提高了它的国际地位。就是在参加了马尼拉条约和巴格达条约集团的菲律宾和泰国，要求摆脱军事集团束缚和反对美国控制的呼声，也日益高涨。
    两年来，亚非国家间友好合作关系的发展，和平地区的扩大，是帝国主义所不高兴的。以美国为首的帝国主义集团继续在亚非地区加强军事集团，进行分裂、颠复和侵略活动。美国已成了亚非人民最凶恶的敌人。它正在中东推行“艾森豪威尔主义”，企图用军事压力、经济诱饵、挑拨离间和颠复活动等手法，达到控制和奴役这一地区国家的目的。但是，只要亚非各国人民加强团结，提高警惕，殖民主义者的罪恶阴谋是一定会被粉碎的。（逸寒）
