The First Evil Consequence of the Eisenhower Doctrine
By Our Staff Commentator

The situation in Jordan continues to deteriorate. The Halidi cabinet has announced its resignation. All political parties have been dissolved. Former Prime Minister Nabulsi and many army officers have been arrested. Demonstrations by the people demanding an independent policy and opposing imperialism have been suppressed. This shows that the pro-imperialist forces in Jordan are now attempting to forcibly reverse Jordan's trend of peaceful neutrality through repressive policies. The reason why they dare to defy the will of the people in this way is due to the instigation and support of US imperialism and its pawns in the Middle East. This is the first evil consequence of the Eisenhower Doctrine in the Middle East.

In the US aggressive plan to implement the "Eisenhower Doctrine" and control Middle Eastern countries, Jordan occupies a very important strategic position. The United States attempts to turn Jordan into its vassal in order to isolate and then shake Egypt and Syria. Before the crisis occurred, the United States, on the one hand, directly lured Jordan with military and economic "aid," and on the other hand, instructed certain Arab countries to warn Jordan of the so-called "communist threat," engaging in instigation and division. After the crisis occurred, US diplomats in Jordan openly interfered in Jordan's internal affairs, repeatedly expressing firm support for measures to suppress the people's anti-imperialist movement, and instructed Israel, Iraq, and others to carry out armed threats against Jordan. This open interference by the United States has strengthened the determination of right-wing forces to continue recklessly in disregard of the people's opposition. And when the right-wing forces take extreme measures to deal with the people's opposition, the United States uses the threat of dispatching the Sixth Fleet to demonstrate its support. The US interference in Jordan's internal affairs and its undermining of Jordan's independence, the colonialist essence of the Eisenhower Doctrine, are now fully exposed.

The US State Department clamored on the 25th that "Jordan's independence and integrity are threatened by international communism." It thought that by fabricating this lie, it could prepare a pretext for forcibly implementing the Eisenhower Doctrine and further openly interfering in Jordan's internal affairs. However, just the day before, on the 24th, when someone asked White House Press Secretary Hagerty whether Eisenhower or Dulles had discovered "any signs of communist activity in the Jordan dispute," Hagerty replied, "No, I don't think it would be fair to say that." This was a very timely and crisp slap in the face prepared for the US State Department.

Judging from the developments of the past two weeks, the anti-imperialist and patriotic forces in Jordan are strong. This force cannot be eliminated by the right-wing forces relying on the support of the United States. The repressive measures taken by the Jordanian right-wing forces can only allow the current chaotic situation to continue, and will only invite further interference and aggression from imperialism. The Jordanian people have just freed themselves from British colonial rule, and they will never want to drill into the Eisenhower Doctrine cage arranged by the United States. King Hussein said on the 25th that he himself had always opposed the visit of the US Richards delegation to Jordan. This at least shows that he understands the feelings of the Jordanian people. The current situation in Jordan is not beyond redemption. As long as Jordan's patriotic forces unite, this fierce challenge of US imperialism to Jordan, and also to all free Arab countries, can be defeated.

    艾森豪威尔主义的第一个恶果
    本报评论员
    约旦局势正在继续恶化。哈利迪内阁已经宣告辞职。一切政党都被解散。前任首相纳布西和许多陆军军官被捕。人民为要求奉行独立政策、反对帝国主义而举行的示威游行遭到镇压。这说明约旦的亲帝国主义势力现在企图用高压政策强行扭转约旦的和平中立的政治趋向。而他们之所以敢于这样违抗人民的意志，是由于美帝国主义和它在中东的走卒们的煽动和支持。这是艾森豪威尔主义在中东结下的第一个恶果。
    在美国推行“艾森豪威尔主义”、控制中东各国的侵略计划中，约旦居于十分重要的战略地位。美国企图把约旦变成它的附庸，以便达到孤立并进而动摇埃及和叙利亚的目的。在危机发生以前，美国一方面直接以军事、经济“援助”对约旦进行诱惑，另一方面指使某些阿拉伯国家向约旦提出所谓“共产主义威胁”的警告，进行挑拨和分化。在危机发生以后，美国驻约旦的外交人员公开干涉约旦的内政，一再表示坚决支持镇压人民反帝运动的措施，并且指使以色列、伊拉克等对约旦实行武力威胁。美国的这种公开干涉，加强了右翼势力不顾人民反对继续蛮干的决心。而当右翼势力采取极端措施来对付人民的反对的时候，美国更用出动第六舰队示威的威胁手段来予以声援。美国干涉约旦内政、破坏约旦独立的行为，艾森豪威尔主义的殖民主义实质，现在已经暴露无遗了。
    美国国务院在25日叫嚷说，“约旦的独立和完整受到了国际共产主义的威胁”。它以为用这一派胡诌，就可以为强行推行艾森豪威尔主义、进一步公开干涉约旦内政准备好借口。但是，就在前一天，24日，有人问白宫新闻秘书哈格蒂说，艾森豪威尔或杜勒斯曾否发现“在约旦纠纷方面有共产党活动的迹象”。哈格蒂回答说：“没有，我认为这样说会是不公允的。”这真是给美国国务院准备好了的一记十分及时而且清脆的耳光。
    从过去两个多星期的事态发展看来，约旦的反帝爱国的力量是强大的。这个力量不是右翼势力凭借美国的支持所能消灭的。约旦右翼势力所采取的高压措施，只能使目前这种混乱局势继续存在下去，只会招致帝国主义的进一步干涉和侵略。约旦人民刚刚从英国的殖民统治下挣脱出来，他们决不会愿意钻进美国布置下的艾森豪威尔主义的牢笼。侯赛因国王在25日说，他本人一直反对美国理查兹代表团访问约旦。这至少说明他是了解约旦人民的情绪的。约旦目前的局势并不是不可挽救的。只要约旦的爱国力量团结起来，美帝国主义对约旦、同时也是对所有自由的阿拉伯国家的这场凶恶的挑战，是可以击败的。
