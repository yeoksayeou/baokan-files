Xinhua News Agency, April 28th: Western news agencies report that the main figures in the new Jordanian cabinet recently appointed by King Hussein are all "pro-Western."

The new Prime Minister and Minister of Justice, Ibrahim Hashem, 69, although non-partisan, has close long-term relations with Jordan's Hashemite royal family. He has served as Prime Minister four times in the past. Before World War II, when Britain had not yet granted independence to Transjordan at the time, Hashem was already an important assistant to King Abdullah (the grandfather of the current King Hussein). He served as Speaker of the Senate. He was also a member of the Regency Council, which acted as king when Hussein visited Europe in 1955.

The new Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Samir al-Rifai, also served as Prime Minister under King Abdullah. He worked with Hashem in several cabinets. During his tenure as Prime Minister in January 1956, his statements on Jordan's participation in the Baghdad Pact were considered ambiguous. At that time, he also ordered a ban on public gatherings to express opposition to the Baghdad Pact and demand the abolition of the Anglo-Jordanian Treaty. Agence France-Presse recently mentioned him, saying that he "is known to be sympathetic to the West and the United States." "He is considered a good friend of the American (resident in Jordan) Ambassador Mallory." Agence France-Presse said on April 26 that the series of measures recently taken by Hussein "can be attributed to the advice Rifai gave last month."

The new Minister of Defense, Suleiman Toukan, who was appointed as the National Military Commander on April 25, has a long-standing relationship with Britain. The Associated Press said on April 26, when referring to him, "During the British Mandate in Palestine, even during the serious events in the Arab world before the war, Toukan also cooperated with Britain." The Associated Press quoted Western diplomats in London as saying that Hussein's appointment of Toukan as National Military Commander this time was a "brilliant move" by Hussein.

The other members of the new cabinet are also said to be pro-Western.

    约旦新内阁人物的脸谱
    据新华社28日讯　西方通讯社报道，约旦国王侯赛因最近任命的新内阁的主要人物都是“亲西方的”。
    现年六十九岁的新首相兼司法大臣易卜拉欣·哈希姆虽然是无党派人士，但是同约旦的哈希米特王室有密切的长期关系。他过去曾经四度担任首相。在第二次世界大战以前，当英国还没有给予当时的外约旦独立的时候，哈希姆就已经是阿卜杜拉国王（现国王侯赛因的祖父）的重要助手。他曾担任上议院议长。他还是摄政会议的委员，当1955年侯赛因到欧洲去访问时，摄政会议曾经代行国王的职务。
    新内阁的副首相兼外交大臣萨米尔·里法伊也曾经在阿卜杜拉国王手下担任过首相。他曾同哈希姆在几届内阁中共事过。他在1956年1月担任首相期间，对于约旦参加巴格达条约问题发表的声明，态度被认为很暧昧。而且当时他还下令禁止人民召开为了表示反对巴格达条约、要求废除英约条约的集会。法新社最近在提到他时说，他“是大家知道得到西方和美国的同情的”。“他被认为是美国（驻约旦）大使马里洛的一个很好的朋友。”法新社4月26日说，侯赛因最近采取的一系列措施“得归因于里法伊上个月提供的建议”。
    新内阁的国防大臣、4月25日被任命为全国军事长官的苏莱曼·图康同英国有长久的关系。美联社4月26日在提到他时说，“在英国受托管巴勒斯坦的时候，甚至在战前阿拉伯发生严重事件期间，图康也是同英国合作的”。美联社援引伦敦的西方外交家的意见认为侯赛因这一次任命图康为全国军事长官是侯赛因的“一着妙棋”。
    新内阁的其他成员据说也是亲西方的。
