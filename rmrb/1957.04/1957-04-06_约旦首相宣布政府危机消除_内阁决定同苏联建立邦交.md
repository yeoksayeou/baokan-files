Xinhua News Agency, April 5th, TASS Beirut, April 4th: According to a "Telegraph" Amman dispatch, Jordanian Prime Minister Nabulsi said that the Jordanian government crisis has been resolved. The newspaper wrote that well-informed sources said that the King had expressed to Nabulsi his willingness to act in accordance with the constitution.

Xinhua News Agency, April 4th, Amman: The Jordanian cabinet decided at a meeting on the 2nd to establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, April 5th: Jordanian Prime Minister Nabulsi said on the 3rd that his country is seeking to maintain good relations with both East and West without discrimination, "Therefore, we have a duty to reject the view that we should not be friendly with the Eastern bloc simply because the West demands that we not be friendly with it."

He said this when announcing Jordan's decision to exchange diplomatic envoys with the Soviet Union.

The Prime Minister reiterated Jordan's policy of non-alignment. He said that Jordan is willing to accept assistance from either side, provided that such assistance is not attached to conditions and restrictions.

Speaking of the pressure his government faces at home, he said that this pressure is being exerted by reactionaries seeking to seize power. They claim that the abolition of the Anglo-Jordanian treaty and the complete reliance on Arab aid are "rash actions."

The Middle East News Agency also quoted Amman political observers as saying that the United States has recently been stubbornly trying to prevent Jordan from joining the Arab Liberation Front and to persuade Jordan to accept the proposal to settle Palestinian refugees outside of Palestine. As a means of exerting pressure, the United States has stopped its aid to Jordan and ordered the non-payment of the six million dollars still owed in the Fourth Point Program to Jordan.

    约旦首相宣布政府危机消除
    内阁决定同苏联建立邦交
    新华社5日讯　塔斯社贝鲁特4日讯：据“电讯报”安曼消息，约旦首相纳布西说，约旦政府的危机已经消除。这家报纸写道，消息灵通人士说，国王已经向纳布西表示准备根据宪法行事。
    新华社4日讯　安曼消息：约旦内阁在2日举行的一次会议上决定同苏联建立外交关系。
    据新华社开罗5日电　约旦首相纳布西3日说，他的国家正在设法无所歧视地同东西两方保持良好关系，“因此，我们有责任拒绝这种意见，就是仅仅由于西方要求我们不同东方集团友好而就不同它友好”。
    他是在宣布约旦决定同苏联互派外交使节的时候这样说的。
    首相再一次表明了约旦的不参加集团的政策。他说，无论哪一方面提供援助，约旦都愿意接受，只要是这种援助是不附有条件和限制的。
    谈到他的政府在国内遇到的压力的时候，他说，这种压力是力图夺取当权地位的反动分子施加的。他们声称，废除英约条约和完全依靠阿拉伯援助是“轻率的行动”。
    中东通讯社还引述安曼政治观察家的话说，美国近来曾经顽强地努力阻挠约旦参加阿拉伯解放阵线和使约旦接受在巴勒斯坦以外安顿巴勒斯坦难民的建议。作为施加压力的手段，美国停止了它对约旦的援助，下令不支付在对约旦的第四点计划中尚应支付的六百万美元。
