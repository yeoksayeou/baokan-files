Title: The Sickly

In Cantonese, people who are often sick are called "sickly," alongside terms like "buyer" and "expert." This term is not respectful enough for truly sick people who deserve sympathy, but it is very suitable for another kind of person, those who are not sick or only slightly ill but are anxious all day long and always running to the hospital. Since the introduction of the public medical system, a group of such "sickly" people has emerged.

The public medical system has brought happiness to many employees, but it has brought "unhappiness" to this kind of person. They were originally not sick or rarely sick, but since they had a public medical card in hand, they turned into "sickly Yuchi" and "sickly Xishi."

A Guangzhou municipal people's representative inspected various hospitals and found that the city's public medical expenses exceeded the budget by more than 260,000 yuan last year. A very important reason for this is that 30% of the public medical beneficiaries who went to see the doctor did not need to see the doctor at all because they only suffered from minor illnesses or had no illness at all. A typical example of this is a cadre in the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau who suffered from mild neurasthenia and saw the doctor a total of 290 times in three years, not counting hospitalization time. This situation is not limited to Guangzhou; it exists in many other places, probably because there is some "common pattern" in it. A head nurse told me that our bed turnover rate is much smaller than that of the Soviet Union, one of the reasons being that some "patients" refuse to leave even when they are well, always saying that they are sick. A county hospital director told me that there are also "patients" who insist on writing their own prescriptions, such as thinking of "using aureomycin to irrigate the intestines" when their stomachs are uncomfortable. It can be seen that for some people, having a public medical card in hand not only immediately causes a hundred diseases to arise but also suddenly makes them more knowledgeable than all doctors, trampling the world's medical level under their feet.

This matter reminds people of some descriptions in the Soviet novel "Virgin Soil Upturned." When the agricultural collectivization was being carried out in the Soviet Union, some peasants with strong private thoughts were afraid that they would suffer losses in the collectivization or mistakenly believed rumors that livestock would be turned over to the public, so they slaughtered their livestock and ate them to their fill, lying in bed unable to move and groaning in agony... This is the influence of a long-term private ownership society on people's minds. Always wanting to go to the hospital and take tonics when a public medical card is in hand is spiritually similar to those gluttons who groan in bed with their bellies full. The pernicious influence of "private ownership" is really quite considerable.

It is said that essays often have a one-sided nature. It should be stated again and again that such people only account for a very small proportion of all cadres and employees. If all public medical beneficiaries were such "sickly" people, that would be terrible. The national budget would not need to be used for national defense, economy, culture, or construction, and would probably be used up by seven or eight tenths just to "see a doctor" and take tonics for everyone.

Most of these patients are so-called neurasthenia patients. A characteristic of some of these patients is: they are listless, but when they talk about their illness, they are radiant. They cannot work, but they are elegant when choosing medicines and questioning doctors. Many of them do have serious illnesses, and the drugs are indeed incurable. But they have gone to the wrong place to seek medical treatment. What they should be looking for is a doctor of the mind, not a doctor in white who looks at the tongue and taps the knee.

The people's representative who inspected the hospital said that the reason this situation arises "is because some employees do not cherish state property or do not recognize that this is a waste." I think our people's representative is too honest. What "do not recognize that this is a waste"? If public medical care is canceled for these people, and they pay for their own medical treatment, I guarantee that they will immediately recover, and their medical records will immediately drop like a mercury column hitting an ice cube.

However, for this kind of sickly person, their physical health is indeed worrying if they continue to do this for a long time. Content determines form, and form also affects content. Running to the hospital every two or three days will slowly make them feel that they are terminally ill. And the collapse of the spirit is the beginning of real disease. All long-lived people in the world are basically people who love labor. Whether it is George Bernard Shaw in England, the old shepherd over a hundred years old in the Soviet Union, our Qi Baishi, or even the old monk Xuyun, who was still chanting "Hoeing clouds to plant thousands of pine trees, drawing water to carry a scoop of moonlight" at the age of one hundred and eighteen, they all love labor. And all the fat people in the world who spend their days in recliners are short-lived.

Collectivism is not only a panacea in sociology but also in medicine. If a person lives diligently and openly, their spirit will be cheerful, and they will have fewer illnesses. And people who are preoccupied with gains and losses and are restless are just the opposite. For the above-mentioned category of sickly people, after years of random medication and the inability of doctors to do anything, I advise them to try this panacea.

    病家
    秦牧
    在广东话里，把多病的人叫做“病家”，和“买家”“行家”等等并列。这个词儿对于值得同情的真正多病的人在意味上是不够尊重的，然而对于另外一种人却很合适，这就是那种没病或者微病而惶惶不可终日老是跑医院的人物。自从有了公费医疗制度，这样一批“病家”也就应运而生。
    公费医疗制度给许许多多的职工带来了幸福，然而却给这样一种人带来了“不幸”，他们原来是不病或少病的，自从有了这个制度，一张公费医疗证在手，他们就纷纷变成了“病尉迟”和“病西施”了。
    一位广州的市人民代表视察各个医院，发现去年全市公费医疗超支二十六万多元。这里面很重要的一个原因，就是跑去看病的公费医疗享受者中有30％原是不需要看病的。因为他们仅患着微病或者根本没有病。这里面的一个典型例子是广州公安局有个患轻微神经衰弱的干部，三年来除住院时间不计外，总共看了二百九十次病。这种情形并不限于广州一地，其他好些地方都有，大概这里面是有个什么“共同规律”的吧。有一位护士长告诉我，我们的病床周转率比苏联小很多，原因之一就是有一种“病人”好了硬是赖着不肯走，总是说自己有病。有一位县医院院长告诉我，还有一种“病人”硬是要自己开药方，例如肚子不舒服居然想到“要用金霉素来灌肠”之类。可见，对于某一部分人，一张公费医疗症在手，不但立刻百病丛生，而且忽然比一切医生都高明起来，把世界的医学水平都踩在脚下了。
    这种事情使人想起苏联小说“被开垦的处女地”中的某些描写，当苏联的农业合作化正在开展的时候，某些私有心理浓厚的农民生怕在合作化中自己会吃亏，或者误信谣言以为家畜要归公，于是把家畜宰了大吃特吃，吃到饱得躺在床上不会动，辗转呻吟……。长期私有制社会对人们精神的影响就是这样的。一张公费医疗证到手就老是想上医院和吃补药，和那些捧着个肚子在床上呻吟的暴食者在精神上是有它的共通之处的。“私有制”的流毒实在是相当可观的。
    据说杂文常带片面性，这里应该再三声明，这样的人只占全体干部、职工中很小的一个比例。如果全体的公费医疗享受者都是这样的“病家”，那还了得，全国的预算，不必去搞什么国防、经济、文化、建设，仅仅用来给大家“看病”和吃补药，大概就已经用掉七八成了。
    这类病人大多是所谓神经衰弱患者。这类病人中有一部分的特点是：没精打彩，但是讲起病情来神采飞扬。不能劳动，但是选择药品和盘问医生时风度奕奕。他们中有许多人的确是病情严重的，药物也的确是医不好的。但他们求医走错门路了，他们最应该去找的是思想的医生，而不是穿白衣服的看舌头，敲膝盖的大夫。
    那位视察医院的人民代表说，这种情形之所以产生，“是由于一部分职工不爱惜国家资财或者不认识这是一种浪费。”我以为我们的这位人民代表太忠厚了，什么“不认识这是一种浪费”，如果对这部分人取消公费医疗，看病由他们自己掏腰包，我担保立刻手到回春，他们看病的纪录马上会像水银柱碰到冰块一样，迅速下降。
    然而对于这类病家，他们身体的健康长此这样搞下去也确乎是可忧的。内容固然决定形式，形式也会影响内容。三天两天跑医院慢慢就会觉得自己病入膏肓了。而精神的崩溃正是真的疾病的开始。全世界的一切长寿者，基本上都是热爱劳动的人。英国的萧伯纳也好，苏联的一百多岁的老牧人也好，我们的齐白石翁也好，甚至那个一百一十八岁还在吟着“锄云种得松千树，汲水携来月一瓢”的虚云老和尚也好，都是热爱劳动的。而全世界倚在躺椅里过日的胖子，却都是短命的。
    集体主义，不但在社会学上，就是在医学上也是一剂奇药。一个人勤勤恳恳、坦坦荡荡地过日子，精神开朗了，病也会少些。而患得患失，栖栖遑遑的人却恰得其反。对于上面的那一类病家，在连年药不乱投，群医束手之后，奉劝他们不妨试一试这剂灵药。
