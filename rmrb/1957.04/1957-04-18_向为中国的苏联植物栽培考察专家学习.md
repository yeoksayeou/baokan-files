Learn from Soviet Plant Cultivation Experts Visiting China

According to the Sino-Soviet Scientific and Technological Cooperation Agreement, the Soviet Union sent nine agricultural investigation groups to China in 1956 to conduct on-site inspections in a planned manner. The plant cultivation expert group was one of the more important investigation groups. This group included experts in agricultural meteorology, grain, beans, forage crops, vegetables, and fruit trees. They split into two groups to visit and inspect key areas in North China, Central China, East China, and Southwest China, visiting more than fifty units, including agricultural research institutions, agricultural schools, agricultural production cooperatives, state-owned farms, and agricultural experiment stations. In each area, they mostly held symposiums. In less than two months, they held more than thirty symposiums, helping China solve many problems in crop cultivation. We express our sincere respect and heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet government and these outstanding experts!

Regarding China's agricultural zoning issues, Soviet expert Comrade Malyugin suggested: research on agricultural zoning should be creative, rather than simply repeating the established cultivation habits of farmers. Therefore, whether an economist or a cultivation expert, when conducting their work, they must analyze the climatic conditions required by each crop based on agricultural meteorology, and then determine its appropriate distribution area to realize its true economic benefits.

Soviet experts also offered many valuable opinions on crop variety improvement work. Expert Zakharchinko said: To do a good job in wheat selection research, we must first pay attention to the collection of raw materials. The All-Union Institute of Plant Cultivation has collected more than 25,000 wheat varieties from all over the world; local farm varieties should play a very important role in the selection work. Currently, the Soviet Union uses several wheat selection methods, including single-plant selection, group selection, and sexual and asexual hybridization. The most effective method is the combination of sexual hybridization and selection, and the effectiveness of this method has been verified. In addition, regarding the issue of corn selection, experts suggested that using corn inbred lines for hybridization is very effective. Because corn is a cross-pollinated crop, it becomes an inbred line after several years of self-pollination; using inbred lines for hybridization can greatly increase yield, which is called "hybrid vigor." Regarding the prevention of cotton variety degradation, the expert said: The Soviet Union attaches great importance to cotton variety renewal. Within twenty-five years, three cotton variety replacement programs have been carried out throughout the Soviet Union. In the first replacement, the yield of the new varieties was lower and the fibers were shorter; in the second replacement, the yield increased and the fibers were lengthened, but the growth period was longer and the maturity was not reached in some areas; the third replacement has now been completed. The varieties replaced this time not only have a short growth period, but also have long fibers and high yields; now, preparations are being made for the fourth replacement.

In addition, experts gave detailed introductions and answers regarding the utilization of deserts, the supply of winter feed for livestock, the use of machinery in garden production, the rational supply of vegetables, and the planting of feed crops in saline-alkali areas.

In the future, with the development of Sino-Soviet scientific and technological cooperation, more Soviet agricultural scientists will come to China for inspection. We should systematically and earnestly learn from the experts and constantly improve the level of agricultural science in our country.

    向为中国的苏联植物栽培考察专家学习
    根据中苏科学技术合作协定，苏联曾于1956年派了九个农业考察组来中国，有计划地进行了实地考察。植物栽培考察专家是其中比较重要的一个考察组。这个考察组，包括了农业气象专家、谷物专家、豆类专家、饲料作物专家、蔬菜专家、果树专家等。他们分开两路参观考察，走遍了我国华北、华中、华东、西南主要地区，参观了农业研究机关、农业学校、农业生产合作社、国营农场、农业试验站等五十多个单位。每到一个地区，大都举行了座谈会。不到两个月的时间，共座谈了三十余次，帮助我国在农作物栽培方面解决了不少问题。我们对苏联政府和这些优秀的专家表示真诚的敬意和衷心的感谢！
    在我国农业区划问题方面，苏联专家马留根同志提出：研究农业区划应该发挥创造性，而不是把农民已形成的栽培习惯作一个重复的描绘。因之，不论作一个经济学家或栽培学家，当他进行工作的时候，必须在农业气象的基础上来分析每一种农作物需要什么样的气候条件，然后才能确定它的适当分布地区，实现它的真正经济利益。
    在农作物的品种改良工作方面，苏联专家也提出了不少宝贵意见。专家扎哈尔钦柯同志说：要做好小麦选种的研究工作，首先要重视原始材料的搜集。全苏植物栽培研究所，从全世界各处搜集到两万五千多个小麦品种；当地农家品种在选种工作中要占很重要的地位。现在苏联应用的小麦选种方法，有单株选种法、集团选种法、以及有性及无性杂交法数种。最有效的方法，是有性杂交和选择相结合的方法，这种方法的效力，是经过考验证实的。另外，对于玉米选种问题，专家提出应用玉米自交系进行杂交是很有效的。因为玉米是异花授粉作物，经数年自交后，即成为自交系；利用自交系进行杂交，产量可大大提高，称之为“杂种优势”。关于防止棉花品种退化问题，专家说：苏联非常重视棉花品种更新，二十五年之内，在全苏范围内已进行了三次棉花换种工作。第一次换种，新品种的产量较低，纤维也短；第二次的换种，产量提高了，纤维也加长了，但生长期较长，在有些地区来不及成熟；目前已结束了第三次的换种工作，这次换的品种，不仅生长期短，而且纤维长、产量高；现在，正准备进行第四次的换种工作。
    此外，关于沙漠的利用、牲畜冬天饲料的供应、园田生产使用机械、蔬菜的合理供应、盐鹼地带种植饲料作物等方面，专家们都作了详细的介绍和解答。
    今后，随着中苏科学技术合作的发展，苏联将会有更多的农业科学家来我国考察。我们应该有计划地认真地向专家们学习，不断地提高我国农业科学水平。
