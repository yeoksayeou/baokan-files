Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 20th: Over 100,000 people held rallies across Japan today to protest Britain's insistence on testing hydrogen bombs on Christmas Island.

    Anti-test rallies were held in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which had suffered atomic bombings, as well as in Tokyo, Kyoto, Miyagi, Yamanashi, and many other areas. This nationwide protest was launched based on a decision made by the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs on April 8.

    In Tokyo, about two thousand students, women, and trade union representatives held a rally in the rain. Representatives from the Japanese government and various political parties also participated in the rally. William Morrow, Executive Member of the Australian Peace Council and Member of the World Peace Council, who is currently visiting Japan, also attended the rally.

    The rally adopted a declaration and a resolution. The declaration called on the United Nations and governments of all countries to take all effective measures to stop nuclear weapon testing and to sign an agreement on banning nuclear weapon testing. The declaration pointed out that signing an agreement on banning nuclear weapon testing would enable major powers to shift from relying on strength to mutual friendship and trust, and would pave the way for banning nuclear weapons and reducing armaments.

    The declaration also called on the Japanese government to actively strive for the signing of a nuclear weapon test ban treaty and to abandon its proposal for establishing a prior registration system for nuclear weapon tests.

    The resolution adopted by the rally demanded that the governments of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union immediately cease nuclear weapon testing and begin talks on concluding an agreement banning nuclear weapon tests.

    The rally also decided to send an international protest ship to Christmas Island, based on the demands of the people nationwide, to protest Britain's hydrogen bomb tests there.

    After the rally, the demonstrators marched through the city and delivered the declaration and resolution to the British, American, and Soviet embassies in Japan.
