    U.S. in a Dilemma
    "New York Times" Discusses Washington's Plight in Preparing for War
    (Dispatch from this newspaper) On April 4th, the British government released a defense white paper, announcing the reduction of conventional forces, the shrinking of overseas forces, and the vigorous development of nuclear weapons. The "New York Times" commented on this issue in both a dispatch published on April 5th and an editorial on April 7th.
      "What worries Washington," said Reston, the "New York Times" correspondent in Washington, "is the impact of the Macmillan government's decision elsewhere. When Britain announces such revolutionary cuts, can it be expected that other Western European governments will withstand the political pressure from their parliaments not to do the same?"
    Reston said that Britain's withdrawal plan "poured cold water" on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He pointed out that the United States would naturally have to fill the "vacuum" left by Britain, but would also have to "pick up the bill." This "presents the Eisenhower administration with the possibility of increasing the defense burden, at a time when the United States itself is divided on what to spend and how to spend it."
    Finally, Reston pointed out that both Britain and the United States are now increasingly dependent on atomic and hydrogen weapons, while also preparing for "limited wars," "thus they are increasingly encountering a dilemma."
    An editorial entitled "Retreat" was even more concerned about this dilemma facing the United States. The editorial believed that Britain's move "poses one of the most difficult questions we have had to answer since the end of World War II." What should the United States do? The editorial proposed three possibilities: First, "it may take on part of the burden that Britain now intends to lay down." However, the editorial believed that "doing so would be difficult" because "the tax burden on the American people is already heavy, and American resources are already stretched." Second, "it may decide to follow in Britain's footsteps and painstakingly prepare for atomic war," but "this is planned suicide." Third, "reach an understanding with Russia on the mutual abolition of atomic weapons," but this would "require substantial reductions in other weapons, substantial reductions in armed personnel," and "unless it includes Red China." The U.S. government is unwilling to do this. Therefore, the "New York Times" lamented that the U.S. "is now in such an embarrassing dilemma."

    美国进退两难
    “纽约时报”谈华盛顿在备战中的窘态
    本报讯　4月4日，英国政府发表国防白皮书，宣布裁减常规部队、收缩海外部队而大力发展核武器。“纽约时报”先后在4月5日刊载的一篇电讯和4月7日的社论中评述了这一问题。
      “纽约时报”驻华盛顿记者赖斯顿说“使华盛顿担心的是麦克米伦政府的这一决定在其他地方的影响。当英国宣布进行这种革命性的削减时，难道能够料想到其他西欧国家政府能够经得住他们的议会的政治压力而不照样做吗？”
    赖斯顿说，英国的撤军计划对北大西洋公约是“泼了一瓢冷水”。他指出，美国自然要填补英国让出来的“真空”，但同时也得“把账单接过来”。这就“使艾森豪威尔政府面临了增加防御负担的可能性，而这个时候却正是美国自己对于花费什么和如何花费意见有分歧的时候”。
    最后，赖斯顿指出，英国和美国现在都愈来愈依赖原子武器和氢武器，而又要准备进行“有限的战争”，“因而它们日益遇到进退两难的局面”。
    以“后退”为题的社论对美国这种进退两难的处境更为忧虑。社论认为英国的举动对美国“提出了第二次世界大战结束以来我们必须答复的最棘手问题之一。”美国怎么办呢？社论提出了三个可能：第一，“可能挑起英国现在打算就要放下的一部分担子”，然而，社论认为“这样做将是困难的”，因为“美国人民的纳税负担已经很重，美国的资源已经感到拮据”。第二，“可能决定步英国的后尘，处心积虑地为原子战争作好准备”，但是，
  “这是有计划的自杀”。第三，“同俄国就自行废除原子武器问题达成谅解”，而这又“将必须大大地裁减其他武器，大大地削减武装人员”，同时还“除非包括红色中国在内”。这一点美国政府又不愿意。因此“纽约时报”叹息说，美国“现在所处的两难情况是多么难堪”。
