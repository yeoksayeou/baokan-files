The Party Doesn't Treat Me Like an Outsider, and I Don't Have a Guest Mentality
Yang Zixiu, Vice Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Director of the Shanxi Provincial Department of Civil Affairs

I have been working closely with the Communist Party for eight years since liberation. During these eight years, I have never felt that the Party treated me as an outsider, and I myself have never had the idea of being a "guest." I believe that the common ideology of cooperation is for the cause of the people and for building a socialist society. Therefore, today's cooperation is for the cause of socialism. However, cooperation must also have the leadership of the Party. Without the leadership of the Party, there can be no cooperation. On the other hand, those being led cannot blindly obey, because blind obedience will lead to loss of initiative and enthusiasm, and even cause losses to the revolution. And of course, this will not lead to doing things well together.

Over the past eight years, I have deeply realized that to work well with Party members under the leadership of the Party, the first thing is to have a high sense of responsibility for the cause of the people. Without this, one will simply "parrot others," and there will be no criticism and self-criticism. I often think to myself, the Party and the people trust me so much, and all my material enjoyments exceed those of ordinary working people. So, what have I done for the people? Thinking of this, my sense of responsibility for the cause of the people becomes stronger and stronger. With such a sense of responsibility, whether it is in the formulation of various policies, laws, and instructions, or in certain issues in daily work, I will express my opinions freely and dare to boldly insist on my opinions. For example, this year, when discussing and formulating the provisional measures for preferential labor days for impoverished families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, based on the principle that the living standards of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers should not be lower than the living standards of the local general public, the Party member Deputy Director advocated that after assessing the number of preferential labor days in the spring, if the income of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers is lower than the level of the general public due to natural disasters or other reasons during the autumn harvest distribution, adjustments should be made. At that time, I considered that it was certainly necessary to make adjustments if it was too low to ensure the livelihood of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers, but it should also be adjusted if it was too high, so as to prevent the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers from being divorced from the masses and causing them political passivity. Therefore, I advocated that the preferential labor days should be adjusted during the autumn harvest distribution regardless of whether the income of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers was too low or too high. The two sides argued fiercely about this issue. Later, after research by the Provincial People's Committee, my opinion was finally agreed upon. This situation often occurs among several Party and non-Party leading comrades in our Shanxi Provincial Department of Civil Affairs. Due to different personal views, there are often differences of opinion in the discussion of some issues. However, this divergence is based on a common ideological foundation, which is to do the work better. Therefore, after the debate, not only did it not hurt feelings, but it strengthened unity.

I remember when I participated in the land reform work team organized by the central government to go south to Jiangxi Province to help with land reform work in 1952. At that time, some non-Party comrades were afraid of being labeled with "landlord and rich peasant ideology" and had the idea of rather being "left" than right. At this time, my own thinking was also fluctuating, but later I thought that being right would be unfavorable to the cause of the people, and being "left" would also be unfavorable to the cause of the people. The Party's policy represents the interests of the people, so it is better to act according to the policy. When I arrived at Hebo Township in the Fifth District of Le'an County, Jiangxi Province, the land reform work in the township had been going on for quite some time. At that time, the leader of the work team was a Party member comrade who did not act in accordance with the policy stipulations, and did not treat large and small landlords and illegal landlords differently from law-abiding landlords. Everything was done somewhat excessively. At that time, I was assigned to be the deputy leader. After seeing these things, although I wanted to offer opinions at first, I felt that he was a Party member and a Party member with a deep habit of acting arbitrarily and without any democratic style. Today is the world of the Communist Party, so he can do whatever he wants! Later, I thought that this was not right, and I would be responsible for whether the work was done well or badly, so I must not sit idly by. So, on the one hand, I offered him my opinions, and on the other hand, I personally went to another village to inspect and, through research with the peasant association, corrected the deviations in the work in a timely manner. However, later, when the district learned about these situations, at a meeting of the land reform work team in the entire district, the district leader believed that what I did was wrong and said that I had landlord and rich peasant ideology. At that time, I still insisted on my opinion and declared that I could not accept this criticism. Finally, after research by the county party committee, a conclusion was made on my approach, believing that it was completely correct, and thus correcting the deviations that had occurred in other townships at that time. After such mutual criticism, not only was the work done well, but the relationship between comrades became more harmonious.

Therefore, I believe that to do a good job in the cooperative relationship between Party and non-Party comrades, we must proceed from the interests of the people everywhere and boldly carry out criticism and self-criticism.

### 党没有把我当外人  我也没有作客思想

    党没有把我当外人  我也没有作客思想
    民革山西省委员会副主任委员  山西省民政厅长  杨自秀
    我从解放后和共产党在一起亲密无间地合作共事已有八年了。在这八年当中，我从没有感到党把自己当作外人看待，而我自己也从没有过“作客”的思想。我认为合作共事的共同思想，就是为了人民的事业、为了建设社会主义社会。因此，在今天的合作共事，就是共社会主义的事。但合作共事，还必须有党的领导。离开了党的领导，也谈不到合作共事。而另一方面，被领导者也不能盲目服从，因为盲目服从，就会失去积极性和主动性，甚至会给革命带来损失，而且这样当然就不会把事共好。
    八年多来，我深深体会到，要在党的领导下，和党员同志共同把工作搞好，首先就是要对人民事业有高度的责任感。没有这一点，就会“人云亦云”，就不会有批评和自我批评。我自己常想，党和人民是这样信任自己，自己的一切物质享受又都超过了一般劳动人民，那么，我对人民又作了些什么呢？想到这里，自己对人民事业的责任感就越来越强烈了。有了这样的责任感，不论在各项政策、法令、指示的制定上，也不论在日常工作中的某些问题上，我也就会畅所欲言地发表我的意见，并且敢于大胆坚持自己的意见。比如今年在讨论制定贫苦烈军属优待劳动日的暂行办法的时候，根据烈军属的生活水平应不低于当地一般群众的生活水平的原则，党员副厅长主张：在春天评定了优待多少个劳动日后，如果秋收分配时，烈军属的收入因为自然灾害或其他原因而低于一般群众的水平，就应该再作调整。当时我考虑低了固然应该调整，以保证烈军属的生活，但是高了也应该调整，以免烈军属的生活脱离群众，给他们在政治上造成被动。因此，主张在秋收分配时烈军属的收入不管偏低还是偏高，优待的劳动日都应作调整。双方为这个问题争执得很厉害，后来经过省人民委员会的研究，还是同意了我的意见。这种情况，在我们山西省民政厅几个党与非党的领导同志中，是经常发生的。由于个人的看法不同，往往在一些问题的讨论上有分歧意见。但这种分歧都是建立在共同的思想基础上，就是为了把工作搞得更好，所以经过争论不但没有伤害感情，反而加强了团结。
    记得在1952年参加中央组织的南下土地改革工作团，到江西省帮助土地改革工作时，当时有些非党同志怕戴“地富思想”的帽子，曾有宁“左”勿右的思想。这时候，自己的思想也是动荡不定，但后来想到，右了对人民事业不利，“左”了对人民事业也不利，党的政策就是代表人民的利益，还是按政策办事对。及至到了江西省乐安县第五区荷波乡后，该乡的土地改革工作，已经进行了相当的时期。当时的工作组长是个党员同志，不按照政策规定办事，对大小地主和非法地主与守法地主不是分别对待，各方面都搞得有些过火。自己当时是被派去做副组长，看到这些后，一开始虽也想提意见，但感到他是党员，又是一个遇事独断专行习气很深而毫无民主作风的党员，今天是共产党天下，想怎搞就怎搞吧！后来又想这样不对，工作搞好搞坏自己都有责任，决不能坐视不理。于是自己一面向他提出意见，一面就亲自到另一个村里去检查，并通过和农会研究，及时纠正了工作中的偏向。但后来当区上了解到这些情况后，在一次全区土地改革工作队的会议上，区的领导却认为我那样作是错误的，并说我有地富思想。当时自己仍然坚持了自己的意见，声明不能接受这一批评。最后，经过县委研究，才对我的作法作了结论，认为那样作完全正确，并从而纠正了当时其他乡在工作上发生的偏向。经过这样的互相批评之后，不但工作搞好了，同志间的关系也更融洽了。
    因此，我认为搞好党与非党同志的合作共事关系，就是要处处从人民利益出发，大胆地开展批评与自我批评。
