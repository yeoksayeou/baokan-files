Xinhua News Agency, April 18th. Asanuma Inejirō, Secretary-General of the Japanese Socialist Party and head of the Japanese Socialist Party Goodwill Mission to China, gave a speech here tonight at the invitation of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs to more than 500 people from all walks of life in Beijing, freely discussing how to promote Sino-Japanese friendship.

Asanuma Inejirō said that the normalization of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations is a very important issue in Japan's diplomacy and politics now. The Japanese people have a very strong demand for this issue.

Asanuma Inejirō said that in order to realize the normalization of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, the Japanese Socialist Party has decided to launch a mass national movement in the Diet and among the people to urge the government to conclude payment agreements, establish trade representative offices, lift the restrictions of the Paris Coordinating Committee's embargo, implement fisheries agreements, and cultural agreements between governments; and through these struggles, to not recognize two Chinas and to quickly restore diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China.

He said that the purpose of the goodwill mission sent by the Japanese Socialist Party to visit China in February this year was to exchange views on various issues such as diplomacy, economy, and culture between Japan and China. He said that after the goodwill mission came to China, they had the opportunity to meet with Chinese leaders headed by Premier Zhou Enlai and exchanged views on issues related to the normalization of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, strengthening cooperation among Asian and African countries, and world peace, thereby deepening their understanding. When talking about the Taiwan issue, Asanuma Inejirō said that the Japanese Socialist Party's attitude towards this issue is: there is only one China, and Taiwan is a part of China; it does not recognize two Chinas, does not recognize Taiwan's independent regime and trusteeship of Taiwan; the Taiwan issue is China's internal affair, and hopes that the Chinese government and Taiwan will negotiate directly to seek a peaceful solution, and foreign countries should not interfere. He also hoped that peaceful solutions could be achieved through Sino-US talks, Japan-China talks, and other channels.

He said that the issue of restoring Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations should now be handed over to the two governments for direct negotiations. At the same time, before fully starting this negotiation, government agreements such as meteorology and postal services should be signed, and some existing non-governmental agreements should be changed into government agreements. The Japanese Socialist Party leader stated that the Japanese Socialist Party will make its greatest efforts to realize the normalization of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations.

Asanuma Inejirō pointed out that the reason why the Japanese Socialist Party wants to make its greatest efforts for this issue is because: First, after the Second World War, Japan has successively concluded peace treaties with many countries. However, China, which had the most accidents during the war and is the closest to Japan, has been delayed in restoring diplomatic relations, which is intolerable to the Japanese people. The Japanese people have expressed great dissatisfaction with the Japanese conservative government. Second, Japan's current economy shows a tendency to rely on the US war economy, and "there is no national independence without economic independence." The Japanese people demand to develop trade and economic exchanges with China and Southeast Asian countries. Third, Japan formed an alliance with Germany and Italy in the Second World War, attempting to develop imperialism; now Japan intends to play a mediating role in the development of US imperialism, wanting to repeat past failures. The Japanese Socialist Party opposes this diplomatic policy and advocates pursuing independent and autonomous, non-aligned, and good-neighborly and friendly diplomacy. Fourth, after suffering atomic bomb disasters and hydrogen bomb test disasters three times, the Japanese people realized that atomic war is the destruction of mankind. Therefore, the Japanese people unanimously demanded absolute opposition to atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, and opposition to war. The Japanese people demand to get rid of the US military rule, not to join any camp, to conduct independent and autonomous diplomacy, to strengthen cooperation with China and Asian and African countries, and to expand the peace zone. Fifth, Japanese socialists have the responsibility to prevent the development of Japanese militarism and to promote good-neighborliness and friendship. Sixth, the Japanese conservative party's attitude towards Japan's independence and world peace has changed somewhat.

Asanuma Inejirō also talked about the basic policy of the Japanese Socialist Party's diplomacy. He said that the Japanese Socialist Party's foreign policy is to get rid of US rule, not to join any camp, to be completely independent and autonomous, to be good neighbors and friends with all countries, and to advocate the establishment of a collective security system including Japan, China, the Soviet Union, and the United States. After the establishment of this system, the Japan-US Administrative Agreement and the Japan-US Security Treaty will be abolished, and the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance will also be abolished. He said that the Japanese Socialist Party believes that there are not only two major camps, East and West, in the world. In the Asian and African regions, there are many countries that have been liberated from more than 250 years of Western European colonialism. These countries do not want war for their own construction and hope for good-neighborliness and friendship. Japan also hopes to strengthen friendship with Asian and Arab countries, not to join any camp, implement an independent and autonomous policy, and strive to expand the peace zone. The Japanese people demand the withdrawal of foreign troops from Japan and Asia and the abolition of military bases. Asanuma Inejirō also believes that the Second Asian-African Conference should be convened as soon as possible. He said that the Japanese Socialist Party supports the People's Republic of China joining the United Nations as soon as possible.

In his speech, Asanuma Inejirō also talked about the post-war Japanese political situation and introduced the struggles of the Japanese people to strive for complete independence, oppose the US military occupation of Japan, and oppose the use and testing of atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs.

Among those who listened to his speech tonight were members of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Beijing, and people from all walks of life. Before Asanuma Inejirō's speech began, Zhang Xiruo, President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, delivered a speech to welcome him. Zhang Xiruo said that the Japanese Socialist Party has consistently played an important role in striving for Japan's complete independence and defending peace in the Far East, and has also made active contributions to promoting Sino-Japanese friendship and the normalization of relations between the two countries recently. He also wished the Japanese Socialist Party greater success in these areas, especially in its efforts to promote the normalization of relations between Japan and China.

    浅沼稻次郎畅谈促进中日友好问题
    新华社18日讯　日本社会党书记长、日本社会党访华亲善使节团团长浅沼稻次郎今晚应中国人民外交学会的邀请，在这里向北京各界人士五百多人发表演说，畅谈了如何促进日中友好问题。
    浅沼稻次郎说，现在日本在外交上政治上非常重要的问题是日中邦交正常化的问题。日本人民对这一问题要求是非常强烈的。
    浅沼稻次郎说，日本社会党为实现日中邦交正常化，已决定在国会以及在国民中发动一个群众性的国民运动，争取促使政府与政府之间缔结支付协定、互设贸易代表处、撤消巴黎统筹委员会的禁运限制、执行渔业协定和文化协定；并且通过这些斗争，不承认两个中国和迅速同中华人民共和国恢复邦交。
    他说，日本社会党今年2月间决定派遣来中国访问的亲善使节团的访华目的，就是要就日中两国之间的外交、经济、文化等各种问题交换意见。他说，亲善使节团来到中国后，能有机会和以周恩来总理为首的中国领导人见面，就有关日中邦交正常化、加强亚非国家的合作和世界和平问题交换了意见，从而加深了他们的认识。在谈到台湾问题时，浅沼稻次郎说，日本社会党对这个问题的态度是：中国只有一个，台湾是中国的一部分；不承认两个中国，不承认台湾的独立政权和托管台湾；台湾问题是中国的内政问题，希望由中国政府和台湾直接谈判，以求得和平解决，外国不应干涉。他还期望能通过中美会谈、日中会谈等途径来和平解决。
    他说，恢复日中邦交问题，现在应该交给两国政府直接进行谈判。同时，在全面开始这个谈判以前，应签订气象、邮政等政府协定，并把现有的一些民间协定改变为政府协定。这位日本社会党领袖表示，日本社会党将为实现日中邦交正常化而尽最大的努力。
    浅沼稻次郎指出，日本社会党之所以要为这一问题尽最大的努力，是由于：第一、在第二次世界大战后，日本已经先后和不少国家缔结了和约。但是在战时发生事故最多而且离日本最近的中国倒一直被拖延着没有恢复邦交，这是日本国民所不能容忍的，日本国民对日本保守党政权表示了极大的不满。第二、目前日本的经济表现了依靠美国战争经济的倾向，而“没有经济的独立就没有民族的独立。”日本国民要求和中国以及东南亚各国发展贸易经济往来。第三、日本在第二次世界大战中与德、意结成同盟，企图作帝国主义的发展；现在日本又打算在美帝国主义的发展中起媒介作用，想重犯过去的失败。日本社会党反对这种外交政策，主张推行独立自主，不参加任何阵营，睦邻友好的外交。第四、日本人民在三次遭受原子弹灾害和氢弹试验的灾害后，认识到原子战争就是人类的灭亡，因此日本人民一致要求绝对反对原子弹、氢弹，反对战争。日本人民要求摆脱美国的军事统治，不参加任何阵营，进行独立自主的外交，加强和中国、亚非各国的合作，扩大和平区域。第五、日本社会主义者有责任阻止日本军国主义的发展，和提倡睦邻友好。第六、日本保守党对日本的独立和世界和平的态度已有所改变。
    浅沼稻次郎还谈到了日本社会党外交的基本方针。他说，日本社会党外交政策是，摆脱美国的统治，不参加任何阵营，完全独立自主，和一切国家睦邻友好，主张成立包括日中苏美的集体安全体系，在建立起这个体系后就废除日美行政协定和日美安全条约，同时也废除中苏友好同盟互助条约。他说，日本社会党认为世界上，不仅存在东西两大阵营，在亚非区域里，有许多从二百五十多年的西欧殖民主义下解放出来的国家，这些国家为了自己的建设，不愿战争，希望睦邻友好。日本也希望加强与亚洲、阿拉伯各国的友好，不参加任何阵营，实行独立自主政策，努力扩大和平区域。日本国民要求撤退在日本和亚洲的外国军队，取消军事基地。浅沼稻次郎还认为应尽早召开第二次亚非会议。他说，日本社会党支持中华人民共和国早日加入联合国。
    浅沼稻次郎在演说中还谈到了战后的日本政治形势，介绍了日本人民为争取完全独立、反对美军占领日本和反对使用和试验原子弹、氢弹等斗争情况。
    今晚听他演说的有中国人民外交学会会员、在北京的中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会委员和其他各界人士。在浅沼稻次郎演说开始前，中国人民外交学会会长张奚若致词对他表示欢迎。张奚若说，日本社会党在争取日本完全独立、保卫远东和平方面一贯起着重大作用，最近在促进中日友好和两国关系正常化方面也作了积极贡献。他并祝日本社会党在这些方面，尤其在促进日中两国关系正常化方面所作的努力获得更大的成功。
