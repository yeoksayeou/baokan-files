Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, April 2nd: Zhejiang Province's supply and marketing cooperatives, based on the characteristics of the uneven surplus and deficit of draught cattle in the province's agricultural cooperatives, have adopted various methods to regulate draught cattle. These methods include: utilizing local cattle sources, restoring leasing relationships; actively utilizing the familiarity of original cattle merchants with people, places, and goods to purchase in producing areas, or organizing agricultural cooperatives to purchase directly in producing areas.

After adopting these methods, the problem of insufficient draught cattle in many agricultural cooperatives has been basically resolved. In Huangyan County, fifteen agricultural cooperatives leased ninety-seven head of draught cattle from agricultural cooperatives in mountainous areas; in Yuyao, Linhai, and four other counties, more than 1,100 head of draught cattle were regulated through exchange meetings; after the supply and marketing cooperatives organized agricultural cooperatives to purchase directly in the producing areas, Yuyao, Zhenhai, and other counties have purchased more than 600 head of draught cattle.

    浙江省采取多种办法平衡余缺
    许多农业社的耕牛不足问题基本解决
    据新华社杭州2日电　浙江省各地供销合作社，根据全省农业社的耕牛余缺不平衡的特点，采取多种办法调剂耕牛。这些办法是：利用当地牛源，恢复租借关系；积极利用原有牛商贩的人熟、地熟、货熟等特点，到产地采购，或由供销社组织农业社直接到产地采购等。
    采取这些办法以后，许多农业社的耕牛不足问题，已基本得到解决。黄岩县有十五个农业社向山区农业社租到耕牛九十七头；余姚、临海等六个县，通过交流会调剂的耕牛有一千一百多头；供销社组织农业社直接到产地采购后，余姚、镇海等县已采购到耕牛六百多头。
