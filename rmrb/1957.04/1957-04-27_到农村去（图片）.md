    Going to the Countryside
    The busy farming season has already arrived in the suburbs of Shanghai. In the northern suburbs, over 5,000 mu of edamame, potatoes, taro, garland chrysanthemum, and lettuce have sprouted green seedlings. In the eastern suburbs, the double-cropping early rice has been completely sown; in Zhuhang Township in the western suburbs, the rice seedlings are already half an inch long. The farmers are busy repairing agricultural tools. In order to help the peasant brothers, more than 400 handicraft workers in Shanghai have gone to the countryside. This photo shows Zhao Genfu (left), an old worker from the Shanghai No. 41 Carpentry Production Cooperative, repairing a bullock cart wheel for a farmer. Look at their smiling faces, how affectionate they are.

    到农村去
    农忙季节早已来到上海郊区。北郊区五千多亩的毛豆、洋山芋、芋艿、蓬蒿、莴苣已经长出了绿色的嫩苗。东郊区的双季早稻已经全部播种；西郊区朱行乡的秧苗已有半寸多长。农民们正忙着修整农具。为了给农民兄弟帮忙，上海市有四百多个手工业工人下了乡。这张照片是上海四十一木器生产合作社的老工人赵根福（左）正在给农民修理牛车盘的情形。你看他们脸上都是笑咪咪的，多么亲热。
