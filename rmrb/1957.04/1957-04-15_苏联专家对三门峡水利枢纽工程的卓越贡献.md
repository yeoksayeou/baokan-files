On the eve of the commencement of the great Yellow River Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Project, Soviet experts arrived at the construction site one after another. Korolev, chief engineer of the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Project design, reported on the preliminary design content of the project to cadres of the Sanmenxia Engineering Bureau on March 10. Construction expert Yegorov gave a special report on the construction part of the preliminary design on March 18. Geological expert Savelyev and female geological expert Sakolova came to guide the collection of technical design data after helping to complete the collection of preliminary design data for the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Project. The experts will enthusiastically and consistently help our country complete this great project.

For thousands of years, the feudal rule of China, the Northern Warlords, and the reactionary government of the Kuomintang have failed to properly manage the Yellow River, a well-known scourge both at home and abroad. Some experts from capitalist countries have even drawn pessimistic conclusions about it. But now, the curtain has been raised on fundamentally controlling and developing the Yellow River. The Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Project, which controls 92% of the Yellow River basin, has begun. This great measure to turn the "scourge river" into a "benefit river" powerfully demonstrates the superiority of China's socialist system. At the same time, we must sincerely thank the selfless help of the great internationalist Soviet Union.

From planning, surveying, and design to construction, Soviet experts have made outstanding contributions to every stage of the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Project.

In May 1952, two Soviet experts were invited to conduct on-the-spot inspections of the Sanmenxia, a place with difficult transportation, steep mountains, and rapid water, which has been known as a natural barrier since ancient times. These two experts were Goroglovich, who helped our country rebuild the Xiaofengman Hydropower Station, and geological expert Vagolin. The excellent terrain and geological conditions of Sanmenxia for building a water conservancy hub aroused the great interest of the two experts. They observed in the river by boat in the rapids and dangerous shoals, and climbed mountains and crossed ditches to inspect. Goroglovich affirmed the important role of Sanmenxia in controlling and developing the Yellow River, and suggested doing detailed survey work on it. Vagolin also arranged a batch of geological exploration boreholes. Goroglovich also introduced us to the Soviet Union's advanced experience in comprehensive river utilization and development, and suggested collecting basic data on all aspects of the Yellow River to prepare for the Yellow River basin planning. Since then, the work of drilling the geological conditions of Sanmenxia began, and the survey of the Yellow River basin and the collation of hydrological data of the Yellow River and other basic work were also stepped up. The inspiration of these two experts played an important role in the subsequent completion of the basin planning—the technical and economic report on the comprehensive utilization of the Yellow River basin—and the determination and even construction of the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Project.

In June 1953, the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of Power Industry (then the Ministry of Fuel Industry), and relevant departments established the Yellow River Research Group. On the one hand, they actively collected and analyzed basic data on the Yellow River; on the other hand, they hired a group of Soviet experts to help our country do the Yellow River basin planning.

Building a reservoir on the Yellow River to solve the flood control of the Yellow River as soon as possible and ensure the development of national economic construction was a unanimous opinion. But where should the high dam for blocking and storing floodwater be built first? Some advocated building the Sanmenxia Dam first, while others advocated building dams in Mangshan and Zhichuan first. Opinions could not be unified all the time. The main reason was that the view of comprehensive river utilization was not clear.

The Soviet expert group, including water conservancy, hydrology, hydraulic construction, geology, irrigation, shipping, hydropower and other categories, headed by Korolev, arrived in Beijing in January 1954. They listened to the Yellow River Research Group's introduction to the situation of the Yellow River, and checked the basic data on the Yellow River that had been collected. After a month of intensive analysis and research, they expressed satisfaction with the data collected by our experts and engineering personnel. They believed that the existing data was sufficient for compiling the Yellow River basin plan, and suggested starting to compile the basin plan. Therefore, the Yellow River Research Group expanded its organization and changed its name to the Yellow River Basin Planning Committee, and began to compile the basin plan.

The experts were not satisfied just because the data for compiling the Yellow River basin plan was sufficient. In order to corroborate the existing data with the actual situation, in order to grasp the rich Yellow River data, and to make the Yellow River basin plan more substantial and more scientific, they followed the Yellow River inspection team to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the Yellow River. This large-scale inspection started from the mouth of the Yellow River and went up to Liujiaxia, lasting four months, covering a distance of more than 10,000 miles, and inspecting 29 dam sites on the main and tributaries, as well as downstream embankments, river courses, shipping, soil and water conservation, hydrological stations, etc. This inspection focused on the Sanmenxia, Liujiaxia, Mangshan, Zhichuan and other dam sites. In particular, the inspection of Sanmenxia took more than a day. When inspecting Sanmenxia, ​​the geological expert Ogarin, who was in his sixties, climbed up and down the steep river bank and the dangerous cliffs, holding the geologist's necessary tool - an iron hammer, knocking here and there, examining the nature of the rocks. Korolev also closely followed Ogarin to understand the situation. After this inspection, the experts unanimously affirmed that the Sanmenxia dam site was the best and should be the first hub project to be built in the control and development of the Yellow River. The proposal to list Mangshan and Zhichuan as the first phase of the project was rejected. Because the geological conditions of these two dam sites were not good, the technical conditions for building dams were not easy to solve, and it cost a lot of money, but it could not play a comprehensive utilization effect.

Sanmenxia was determined to be the first hub project to be built on the Yellow River, and the experts immediately put forward the suggestion of finding out the general geological and engineering geological conditions of Sanmenxia and making twenty-four boreholes as a basis for selecting the dam axis.

Soviet experts played a huge role in the completion of China's first basin plan. Goroglovich inspired the preparatory work for the Yellow River basin planning. At that time, the Soviet experts of the Hydropower General Bureau wrote a set of regulations for the compilation of river basin plans, and the expert group supplemented these regulations according to the characteristics of the Yellow River. The experts also very enthusiastically and patiently taught the principles, methods and steps of compiling the plan, and guided the institutional establishment and division of labor of the Planning Committee. It was not enough to give a systematic report to the Planning Committee. When helping the Planning Committee staff to learn to compile the basin plan, they also answered more than two hundred questions. After the first draft of the Yellow River basin plan report was written, they helped revise the manuscript, and finally wrote the conclusion of the Yellow River basin plan. With the enthusiastic and patient help of Soviet experts and the hard and humble learning of Chinese engineering and technical personnel, the basin plan report was finally completed in October 1954.

At the end of February 1955, the Soviet expert group came to China again to check the geological exploration data of Sanmenxia as a basis for formulating the main points of the preliminary design of the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Project, and at the same time put forward suggestions for the next stage of exploration; they also learned about the dam sites of the Yellow River tributaries Jing, Bei Luo, Wei, Yi, Nan Luo, and Qin rivers, which have a great impact on the Yellow River.

The expert group came to China for the third time in the summer of 1956. This time, the main points of the preliminary design of the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Project were put forward, and the geological conditions and site layout of the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Project construction site were understood. Furthermore, focusing on the Sanmenxia issue, the typical measures of soil and water conservation work in the Northwest Loess Plateau were surveyed, and the status quo and prospects of power consumption in industrial cities such as Zhengzhou, Luoyang, and Xi'an were understood.

Now, this is the fourth time that the expert group has come to China and Sanmenxia. This time, the preliminary design of the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Project was put forward, the geological exploration data of Sanmenxia was further checked, and supplementary exploration suggestions for the technical design of the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Project were put forward. In the meantime, the Soviet Leningrad Design Institute undertook the complex and arduous design work of the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Project. More than 1,000 people, headed by Korolev, participated in this design work.

The Soviet experts with noble internationalist spirit also have many noble qualities and excellent working styles.

Soviet experts showed a serious and responsible spirit in their work everywhere. When they first came to China and learned that the Yellow River data was sufficient for compiling the basin plan, they did more than a hundred days of field inspections on the Yellow River before affirming the first phase of the project. During several inspections of Sanmenxia, they always climbed the ridges and cliffs, jumped over ditches and pits, and went down to the exploration wells more than 100 meters deep to watch and check in depth. During the geological exploration of Sanmenxia, ​​due to lack of experience, the detailed records and geological descriptions of the work process were not detailed enough during the drilling and excavation process. Savelyev checked this out, which greatly improved the exploration work. The sand and gravel materials used in the construction of the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Project were initially planned to be mined and transported from the Ba River in Shaanxi and the foothills of Mount Hua, which were 100 to 250 kilometers away. Savelyev opposed this plan and suggested looking for it nearby. As a result, a high-quality and abundant sand and gravel material production area was found in Lingbaojian River, only 54 kilometers away from the dam site. In this way, a lot of mining and transportation costs can be saved. The experts' spirit of hard work and endurance is also very admirable. At the end of May last year, when the experts inspected the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Project construction site, the water supply drilling in Huixing Town, and the sand and gravel materials in the Nanjian River, the floating soil was flying and the weather was extremely hot, and the experts were still sweating all over, but they still insisted on the inspection. Geological experts Savelyev and Sakolova were even more calm and meticulous in their observations and inquiries, and they must clarify the situation before they were finished. After deeply inspecting the Sanmenxia and Wangjiatan dam sites, Goroglovich rode a horse from Wangjiatan, crossed mountains and ridges, and rushed ninety miles in three hours to catch up with the train to Beijing via Mianchi in order to attend a meeting in Beijing. The calm and fearless spirit of the experts is even more praised by the people. Goroglovich took a boat from Sanmenxia along the river to Wangjiatan for inspection. When turning in a rapid current, he suddenly encountered a gust of wind from the valley, and the boat rushed towards the cliff, almost being hit by rocks. In the midst of great danger, Goroglovich still calmly observed the canyon and the river channel, calculating how much power was hidden.

The Soviet experts helped our country compile the Yellow River basin plan, and also helped build the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Project, which turns the "scourge river" into a "benefit river." This is a concrete manifestation of the socialist unity between China and the Soviet Union. In the future, the people in the Yellow River basin who benefit from the transformation of the Yellow River will always remember the contributions of the Soviet experts.

    苏联专家对三门峡水利枢纽工程的卓越贡献
    新华社记者  君谦
    伟大的黄河三门峡水利枢纽工程开工前夕，苏联专家又相继到了工地。三门峡水利枢纽设计总工程师柯洛略夫在3月10日对三门峡工程局干部报告了这一工程的初步设计内容，施工专家耶果洛夫又在3月18日专门做了初步设计中的施工部分的报告；地质专家萨维里也夫和女地质专家萨科洛娃在帮助完成了三门峡水利枢纽初步设计资料的搜集后，又来指导技术设计资料的搜集。专家们将热诚地贯彻始终地要帮助我国把这个伟大工程建筑完成。
    中国几千年来的封建统治和北洋军阀及国民党反动政府，对中外驰名的害河——黄河都没有妥善的治理办法，有些资本主义国家的专家们对它更做出了悲观的结论。可是现在根治和开发黄河的帷幕揭开了，控制黄河流域92％面积的三门峡水利枢纽开工了，这项要变害河为利河的伟大措施，更有力地证明了中国社会主义制度的优越性，同时我们也要衷心地感谢苏联伟大国际主义的无私的帮助。
    三门峡水利枢纽从规划、勘测、设计到施工，每一个阶段都有苏联专家的卓越贡献。
    1952年5月，两位苏联专家被邀请来到了交通困难、山陡水急，自古称为天险的三门峡实地查勘。这两位专家便是帮助我国改建小丰满水电站的哥罗格洛维奇和地质专家瓦果林哥。三门峡可做水利枢纽的优良地形和地质条件引起了两位专家的极大兴趣。他们坐船在激流险滩的河里观察，爬山越沟查勘后，哥罗格洛维奇肯定了三门峡在治理和开发黄河中的重要作用，建议对它做详细的勘测工作；瓦果林哥也给布置了一批地质勘探钻孔。哥罗格洛维奇还给我们介绍了苏联对河流综合利用开发的先进经验，建议搜集黄河各方面的基本资料，为黄河流域规划做准备。从此，钻探三门峡地质情况的工作开始了，勘测黄河流域的勘测和整编黄河水文资料等基本工作也加紧了。这两位专家的启发，对后来完成流域规划——黄河流域综合利用技术经济报告和三门峡水利枢纽的确定以至于施工都起了重要的作用。
    水利部、电力工业部（当时是燃料工业部）和有关部门在1953年6月成立了黄河研究组，一面积极搜集和分析研究有关黄河的基本资料；一面向苏联政府聘请专家组来我国帮助做黄河流域规划。
    在黄河上建筑水库，以便及早解决黄河防洪，保证国家经济建设的发展，这个意见是一致的。可是首先在哪里建筑拦蓄洪水的高坝呢？有的主张先建筑三门峡坝，有的主张先在邙山和芝川建坝。意见一直统一不起来。总的原因，是对河流综合利用的观点还不明确。
    包括水工、水文、水工施工、地质、灌溉、航运、水电等门类以柯洛略夫为首的苏联专家组在1954年1月到北京。他们听了黄河研究组对黄河情况的介绍，检查了搜集起来的黄河基本资料。经过一个月的紧张分析研究，对我专家和工程人员搜集的资料表示满意。认为已有的资料，编制黄河流域规划已经够用，建议着手编制流域规划。于是黄河研究组扩大组织，改为黄河流域规划委员会，开始了流域规划的编写。
    专家们并不因为编制黄河流域规划的资料够用就满足了。他们为了把已有的资料和实际情况相印证，为了掌握丰富的黄河资料，使黄河流域规划编制得更充实和更科学，就随黄河查勘团对黄河做全面的查勘。这次大规模的查勘，下起黄河入海处，上溯刘家峡，历时四个月，行程万多里，查勘了干、支流坝址二十九处及下游堤防、河道、航运、水土保持、水文站等项。这次着重查勘了三门峡、刘家峡、邙山、芝川等坝址，特别是查勘三门峡就费了一天多的时间。查勘三门峡时，六十多岁的地质专家奥加林在陡峭的河岸和险峻的山崖上，爬上跑下，拿着地质家必备之物——铁锤子，这里敲敲，那里砸砸，检验岩石的性质。柯洛略夫也紧紧跟着奥加林了解情况。经过这次查勘后，专家们一致肯定了三门峡坝址是治理和开发黄河中最好而且应当首先建筑的枢纽工程。以邙山和芝川列为第一期工程的主张被否定了。因为这两个坝址的地质条件都不好，建坝的技术条件都不容易解决，花钱不少，还不能起综合利用的功效。
    三门峡确定为黄河上首先兴建的枢纽工程了，专家们立即提出了查明三门峡一般地质和工程地质情况，做为选定坝轴线的二十四个钻孔的建议。
    中国第一部流域规划的完成，苏联专家是起了巨大作用的。哥罗格洛维奇启发了做黄河流域规划的准备工作，当时水电总局的苏联专家给写出了一套河流流域规划的编制规程，专家组根据黄河的特点又对这个规程做了补充。专家们还非常热诚地、不厌烦地教会编制规划的原则、方法和步骤，指导规划委员会的机构编制和分工。向规划委员会做了系统的报告还不算，在帮助规划委员会的人员学习编制流域规划时，还解答了二百多个疑问。黄河流域规划报告初稿写出来后，帮助修改稿件，最后又写了黄河流域规划结论。苏联专家热诚耐心地帮助，中国工程技术人员艰苦虚心地学习，终于使流域规划报告在1954年10月完成。
    1955年2月底，苏联专家组再次来中国，检查三门峡的地质勘探资料，做为拟定三门峡水利枢纽初步设计要点的根据，同时提出对下一阶段的勘探建议；了解了对黄河影响大的黄河支流泾、北洛、渭、伊、南洛、沁等河的坝址。
    专家组第三次来中国，是在1956年夏季。这一次提出了三门峡水利枢纽初步设计要点，同时了解三门峡水利枢纽施工场地的地质及场地布置，并且围绕着三门峡问题，查勘了西北黄土高原区水土保持工作的典型措施，了解了郑州、洛阳、西安等工业城市用电的现状及远景。
    现在，专家组到中国和三门峡来是第四次了。这一次提出了三门峡水利枢纽的初步设计，进一步检查三门峡的地质勘探资料和提出三门峡水利枢纽技术设计的补充勘探建议。而这中间，苏联列宁格勒设计院承担了复杂艰巨的三门峡水利枢纽的设计工作。以柯洛略夫为首参加这个设计工作的就有一千多人。
    具有崇高国际主义精神的苏联专家还有许多高贵的品质和优良的工作作风。
    苏联专家对工作处处表现了认真负责的精神。当他们初次到中国，了解了黄河资料已够编制流域规划用的情况后又到黄河上做了百多天的实地查勘，才肯定第一期工程。几次查勘三门峡时，总是攀登岭崖，跳越沟坑，下到百多公尺深的探井里去深入观看检查。三门峡的地质勘探，曾因没有经验，在钻探和开挖过程中，工作过程的详细记录和地质描述不够细致，萨维里也夫检查出这一点，使勘探工作得到了很大的改进。建筑三门峡水利枢纽时用的砂石材料，起初曾打算到远在一百到二百五十公里的陕西灞河和华山山麓去采运。萨维里也夫反对了这个计划，建议在附近寻找。结果在距坝址只有五十四公里的灵宝涧河找到了质量优良、数量丰富的砂石材料产地。这样，可以节省许多采运费用。专家们吃苦耐劳的精神也是很令人佩服的。去年5月底，专家们查勘三门峡水利枢纽施工场地、会兴镇供水钻探及南涧河砂石材料时，浮土飞舞迷漫，天气酷热，浑身流汗，专家们仍然坚持查勘。地质专家萨维里也夫和萨科洛娃更是非常沉着、非常细致的观察、寻问，一定要把需要的情况弄清才算完。哥罗格洛维奇在深入查勘了三门峡和王家滩等坝址后，曾为了赶上参加在北京的一个会议，从王家滩骑着马，翻山越岭，以三小时飞驰九十里赶上经过渑池往北京的火车。专家们沉着无畏的精神，更为人们所称道。哥罗格洛维奇从三门峡坐船沿河往王家滩查勘，在一处急流中转弯时，忽然遇着山谷疾风的扑卷，船向山崖冲去，几乎被石头碰坏。在万分惊险中，哥罗格洛维奇仍然沉着地察看着峡谷和河道，计算着蕴藏着多少动力。
    苏联专家帮助我国编制出黄河流域规划，又帮助建设变害河为利河的三门峡水利枢纽的工程，这是中苏两国社会主义团结的具体表现。将来黄河流域受到改造黄河的利益的人们，将会永远感念苏联专家的功绩。
