Strengthen the Great Unity of Socialist Countries and Enhance the Eternal Friendship Between the Chinese and Polish Peoples
Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech at the Banquet Welcoming the Polish Government Delegation

Respected Chairman of the Council of Ministers Comrade,
Respected Comrades of the Entire Delegation,
Comrades, Friends:

Today, we are very pleased to gather in our capital, Beijing, with the representatives of the fraternal Polish people—the esteemed Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Comrade Cyrankiewicz, and all the comrades of the Government Delegation of the Polish People's Republic. Please allow me, on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people, to extend to you our warm欢迎 [huān yíng: welcome].

In January of this year, I and the comrades of the Chinese Government Delegation were invited to visit our fraternal country—the Polish People's Republic. In Poland, we visited famous cities such as Warsaw, Krakow, Wroclaw, and Lodz. We saw your beautiful and rich land, your ancient and excellent culture, and your intelligent and hardworking people creating a happy socialist life. All of this left us with a deep and unforgettable impression.

We are also pleased to see that all the healthy forces in Poland are uniting more and more closely around the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, headed by Comrade Gomulka, and are working hard to consolidate and develop the cause of socialism. The recent results of the Polish parliamentary elections powerfully demonstrate the Polish people's high trust in the Polish United Workers' Party and their firm determination to support the cause of socialism. The Polish people are working hard to overcome current difficulties and are enthusiastically implementing the new five-year plan. We wish the Polish people greater success in these arduous struggles.

The Polish People's Republic has consistently striven to ease international tensions and safeguard world peace. The Polish people have made unremitting efforts to establish a European collective security system and prevent the revival of West German militarism. The Polish people have always sympathized with and supported the just struggle against colonialism in Asia and Africa. It should be particularly pointed out here that Poland, as a member of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in Korea and the International Supervisory and Control Commissions in Indochina, together with other member states, has made important contributions to maintaining peace in Asia. This time, the Government Delegation of the Polish People's Republic, headed by Chairman of the Council of Ministers Comrade Cyrankiewicz, is paying friendly visits to Asian countries, which will undoubtedly play a positive role in further strengthening the great unity of socialist countries, developing friendly relations between Poland and Asian countries, and easing international tensions.

The people of China and Poland have always had a profound friendship. This friendship is not only manifested in the increasingly developing political, economic, and cultural cooperation between the two countries, but also in the unremitting efforts of the people of the two countries to jointly safeguard world peace in international affairs. Both of our countries are members of the socialist family, and the people of our two countries are linked together by the common ideology of Marxism-Leninism and the common cause of building socialism. Therefore, the friendship between us is eternal, unbreakable, and increasingly consolidated and developed. Here, we should emphasize that the Polish people have consistently given active support to the Chinese people in their struggle to safeguard their sovereignty. Poland has also given our country a lot of help in ocean shipping, industrial construction, and science and technology. I would like to take this opportunity to once again express my heartfelt thanks to the Polish Government and the Polish people on behalf of the Chinese Government and the Chinese people.

Respected guests, your friendly visit to our country this time is a major event in Sino-Polish relations. It will undoubtedly further enhance mutual understanding between the people of our two countries, further develop the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries, and strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and benefit the noble cause of world peace and human progress.

Dear comrades and friends, please allow me to propose a toast:

To the increasing prosperity of the Polish People's Republic,
To the eternal friendship between the people of China and Poland,
To the great unity of all socialist countries,
To world peace,
To the health of all comrades of the Government Delegation of the Polish People's Republic headed by Comrade Cyrankiewicz,
To the health of Comrade Zawadzki, Chairman of the State Council of the Polish People's Republic!

    加强社会主义国家的伟大团结　增进中波两国人民的永恒友谊
    在欢迎波兰政府代表团宴会上
    周恩来总理的讲话
    敬爱的部长会议主席同志，
    敬爱的代表团全体同志们，
    同志们、朋友们：
    今天，在我们的首都北京同兄弟的波兰人民的代表——敬爱的部长会议主席西伦凯维兹同志和波兰人民共和国政府代表团的全体同志们欢聚一堂，我们感到非常愉快。请允许我代表中华人民共和国政府和中国人民向你们表示热烈的欢迎。
    今年1月间，我和中国政府代表团的同志们应邀访问了我们兄弟之邦——波兰人民共和国。在波兰，我们访问了华沙、克拉科夫、弗罗茨瓦夫、罗兹等有名的城市。我们看到了你们美丽富饶的土地，你们古老优秀的文化和你们智慧、勤劳的人民正在创造着社会主义的幸福生活，这一切都给我们留下了深刻难忘的印象。
    我们也高兴地看到波兰一切健康的力量正在日益紧密地团结在以哥穆尔卡同志为首的波兰统一工人党中央委员会的周围，为巩固和发展社会主义事业而努力。最近波兰议会选举的结果，有力地表明了波兰人民对于波兰统一工人党的高度信任和拥护社会主义事业的坚定决心。波兰人民正在努力克服当前困难，热情地执行着新的五年计划。我们预祝波兰人民在这些艰巨的斗争中获得更大的成就。
    波兰人民共和国一贯为和缓国际紧张局势、维护世界和平而斗争。波兰人民为建立欧洲集体安全体系和防止西德军国主义的复活作了不懈的努力。波兰人民一贯同情和支持亚非各国的反殖民主义的正义斗争。在这里应该特别指出：波兰作为朝鲜中立国监察委员会和印度支那国际监督和监察委员会的委员同其他委员国一道，对于维护亚洲的和平作了重要的贡献。这次，以部长会议主席西伦凯维兹同志为首的波兰人民共和国政府代表团到亚洲国家进行友好访问，对于进一步加强社会主义国家的伟大团结、发展波兰同亚洲国家的友好关系和和缓国际紧张局势，无疑地将起着积极的作用。
    中波两国人民一向有着深厚的友谊，这种友谊不仅表现在两国间日益发展着的政治、经济和文化合作上，同时也表现在两国人民在国际事务中共同维护世界和平的不懈努力上。我们两国都是社会主义大家庭中的成员，我们两国人民是由马克思列宁主义的共同思想和建设社会主义的共同事业联结在一起的，因此，我们之间的友谊是永恒的、牢不可破的、日益巩固和发展的。在这里，我们应该着重指出：在中国人民维护自己主权的斗争中，波兰人民一贯给予积极支持。在远洋航运、工业建设和科学技术等方面波兰也给了我国很多的帮助。我愿意趁这个机会代表中国政府和中国人民向波兰政府和波兰人民再一次表示衷心的感谢。
    敬爱的贵宾们，你们这次在我国所进行的友好访问，是中波关系中的一件大事，它无疑地会进一步增进我们两国人民间的相互了解，进一步发展我们两国的友好合作关系，并且加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结和有利于世界和平和人类进步的崇高事业。
    亲爱的同志们和朋友们，请允许我建议：
    为波兰人民共和国的日益繁荣，
    为中波两国人民永恒的友谊，
    为社会主义各国的伟大团结，
    为世界和平，
    为以西伦凯维兹同志为首的波兰人民共和国政府代表团全体同志们的健康，
    为波兰人民共和国国务委员会主席萨瓦茨基同志的健康干杯！
