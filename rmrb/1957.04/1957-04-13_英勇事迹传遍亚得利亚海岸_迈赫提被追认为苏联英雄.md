Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th - On April 11th, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR posthumously awarded Mehdi, an Azerbaijani who gloriously sacrificed himself fighting with the Yugoslav-Italian guerrillas in the anti-Hitler fascist war, the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.

After the start of the Great Patriotic War, Mehdi, who was studying at university, put down his books and picked up a rifle. He participated in the battle to defend Stalingrad. During a fierce battle, the twenty-four-year-old Mehdi was seriously wounded and captured by the German fascists. However, he took advantage of an opportunity to escape from their clutches and joined the Yugoslav-Italian Ninth Guerrilla Brigade. From then on, the legendary heroic deeds of the guerrilla group led by Mehdi spread throughout the villages of Slovenia on the Adriatic coast. This guerrilla group blew up fascist warehouses and ammunition trains, attacked German officers, burned down two German aircraft, and disabled the fascist newspaper printing plant in Trieste for a long time due to an explosion. In the summer of 1944, in less than a month, Mehdi used explosives to destroy two fascist oil depots.

Mehdi was outstanding in courage, flexible and calm, understood several languages, and was proficient in engineering operations. He often disguised himself and infiltrated enemy dens. At the end of 1944, he disguised himself as a German officer and entered an officers' club. After socializing with the fascist officers, he placed a briefcase in the corner and left. A little while later, a huge explosion occurred in the club, and many fascist officers were killed.

In November 1944, while returning to camp after completing a mission to blow up an enemy warehouse, Mehdi encountered an enemy ambush. Outnumbered, he used his last bullet to kill himself. The guerrillas buried their glorious comrade-in-arms and inscribed on his tombstone: "Rest in peace, our beloved Mehdi, hero of the Azerbaijani people! The merits you have made for freedom will forever live in the hearts of your friends."

    英勇事迹传遍亚得利亚海岸
    迈赫提被追认为苏联英雄
    新华社莫斯科12日电　苏联最高苏维埃主席团4月11日追赠在反希特勒法西斯战争中参加南斯拉夫—意大利游击队而光荣牺牲的阿塞拜疆人迈赫提以苏联英雄的称号。
    卫国战争开始后，正在大学里学习的迈赫提放下书本，拿起了枪杆。他参加过保卫斯大林格勒的战役。在一次激烈的战斗中，身受重伤的二十四岁的迈赫提，被德国法西斯俘虏了去。但是他利用一次机会从魔掌下逃出来，参加了南斯拉夫—意大利第九游击队。从此以后，在亚得利亚海岸斯洛文尼亚的乡村里，就传遍了迈赫提所领导的游击小组的传奇性的英勇事迹。这个游击小组爆炸法西斯的仓库和军火列车，袭击德国军官，曾经烧毁过两架德国飞机，并且使的里亚斯特的法西斯报纸印刷所由于遭受爆炸而长期不能出版。1944年夏天，在不到一个月的时间里，迈赫提用炸药炸毁过两座法西斯的石油仓库。
    迈赫提胆略出众，灵活沉着，懂得好几种语言，精通工兵作业。他常常化装混入敌人巢穴。1944年底，他化装成德国军官，进入一个军官俱乐部。他同法西斯军官们周旋了一番之后，把一只手提箱放在墙角就走了。不一会，俱乐部发生了大爆炸，许多法西斯军官被炸死。
    1944年11月，迈赫提在完成爆破敌人仓库的任务后返回营地途中，遇上了敌人的伏兵。由于众寡不敌，他用最后一颗子弹打死了自己。游击队员们埋葬了他们的光荣的战友，在墓碑上题词说：“安眠吧，我们可爱的迈赫提，阿塞拜疆人民的英雄！你为了自由所做出的功迹，永远活在你的朋友的心上。”
