    On the Banks of the Bian Hai River
    By Bei Quedi, Reporter for the French Newspaper "L'Humanité"
    The French used to call the road between Hanoi and Saigon "Colonial Highway Number One." Now, this road is interrupted at the Bian Hai River railway bridge, 350 miles south of Hanoi and 600 miles north of Saigon.
    The Bian Hai River roughly follows the 17th parallel, which is the temporary dividing line between South and North Vietnam, separating approximately ten million residents in the south from about thirteen million compatriots in the north. Twenty-three miles west of the Bian Hai River estuary is the border of Laos. The area three miles wide on either side of the Bian Hai River is the demilitarized zone (DMZ). According to the Geneva Accords, the 17th parallel is a temporary dividing line for restoring peace and building Vietnam into a peaceful, unified, and independent nation, but American policy attempts to turn the Bian Hai River into a permanent dividing line.
    The riverbanks are rice paddies. Farmers on both banks wear the same dull yellow clothes, hoeing and plowing in the fields. The Bian Hai River divides Quang Tri Province into two halves, with one half of the Fenlin District on the north bank and the other on the south bank. There are 12,000 households on the north bank and 10,000 on the south bank. In Fenkesuo Village, six small villages are on the north side and three on the south side. Often fathers and mothers live on one side, while their children live on the other. Before July 1955, this situation did not feel inconvenient, because according to the Geneva Accords, residents of the DMZ held special passes and could move freely within the DMZ. Ferries operated on both sides of the Bian Hai River, and residents could also freely pass on the railway bridge of this "Highway Number One." But in July 1955, just when consultative conferences should have been held to discuss the election procedures for unifying Vietnam, the situation changed. The Ngo Dinh Diem regime dispatched several groups of plainclothes police to attack the International Commission stationed there. Residents in the southern DMZ were prohibited from crossing the river, passes were discontinued, and any contact between residents on both sides of the Bian Hai River was strictly forbidden. French and Ngo Dinh Diem officers simultaneously refused to attend special joint group meetings managing the DMZ.
    At the entrance of the Bian Hai River, Fen'an Village is on the north bank and Kasong Village is on the south bank. Both are fishing villages. The people of Fen'an Village are good at shipbuilding, and the people of Kasong Village are skilled in making sails and fishing nets. In the past, fishermen met at sea every day and fished in one production team. But after July 1955, this exchange was also prohibited by the Ngo Dinh Diem clique. On July 27th, one week after the International Commission in Saigon was attacked, a special agent secretly crossed the Bian Hai River at night and set fire to Fen'an Village, burning down ninety-seven houses. The people of Kasong Village on the opposite bank, disregarding the threats and persuasion of Ngo Dinh Diem's military police, crossed the river by boat to help the fishermen of Fen'an Village rebuild their village. Later, the fishermen of Fen'an Village, to express their gratitude, wanted to send a few bags of rice to their neighbors when the fishing teams from both sides met on the fishing grounds, but the South Vietnamese authorities forbade the fishermen of Kasong Village from going to sea; they even towed away their boats.
    On September 2, 1955, the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, residents in the southern DMZ wore their finest clothes and stood on the banks of the Bian Hai River to participate in the commemorative activities of their compatriots on the opposite bank.
    During the national liberation war, the southern part of the Fenlin area was a liberated area, and the northern part was an enemy-occupied area. The liberated area implemented rent reduction and interest reduction, and land belonging to imperialist elements and national traitors, as well as public wasteland, was distributed to the peasants. The residents lived well. In the northern enemy-occupied area, the living conditions were extremely miserable. The area, which is now the northern DMZ, experienced some of the most brutal disasters several times throughout the war. Near the Tangtelai military stronghold, a riverfront military stronghold near the Bian Hai River railway bridge to the estuary, eight hundred patriots were massacred on nearby hills in the second half of 1952 alone, two hundred of whom were members of the Labor Party. The four crooked-neck trees on the hill were used as gallows. On one night of terror, eighty patriots were buried alive in a large grave. In the last years of the war, two or three thousand patriots were massacred in the Fenlin area north of the Bian Hai River.
    "After the French troops withdrew, the biggest difficulties we encountered were famine and disease," said the chairman of the district administrative committee. "Ordinary peasants could only eat one meal of rice every six days, and the rest was sweet potatoes and miscellaneous grains. Residents suffered from starvation, and a large proportion of them contracted malaria, trachoma, and venereal diseases left behind by the occupiers. The fields were filled with barbed wire and landmines. The peasants could not cultivate."
    Land reform, production mutual aid teams, and government assistance changed this situation. About three thousand of the twelve thousand households were allocated land, averaging three plots per person (approximately one-fifth of a hectare). In the process of land reform, mistakes were made here. In the past, two hundred and sixty people were classified as landlord components, and now one hundred and fifty of them have been reclassified as "middle" peasant components. Eleven thousand households have joined mutual aid teams, and agricultural production here has risen rapidly.
    "Last year, the rice quota for each person in all of Vietnam was six hundred and sixty pounds," said the chairman of the committee. "Our land is thin, and each person harvests an average of five hundred and fifty pounds of rice. Adding sweet potatoes and miscellaneous grains, the staple food can exceed one thousand pounds. Even the most needy households can eat more than half rice a year."
    A female anti-Japanese war hero, now a member of the district committee, said: "Just a year ago, our clothes were ragged, but now you can no longer find people who can't afford clothes." This is indeed the case. When I arrived in the Bian Hai River area, a cold wave had just arrived in central Vietnam. People were wearing warm cotton-padded jackets, in stark contrast to the patched clothes that people had seen a year ago. The chairman said that trachoma, malaria, and venereal diseases have been eliminated by 80%; literacy classes have also achieved great results, and they plan to eliminate illiteracy by the end of 1957.
    The lives of the people south of the Bian Hai River have also changed. In addition to growing rice, residents in the south have three sources of livelihood: fishing, collecting wood, bamboo, and other forest products, and they can also sell handicrafts at a central market south of the DMZ. Now, fishing is almost completely prohibited, and the activities of fishing boats in strictly restricted areas are also subject to surveillance by special agents. Collecting wood and forest products is also prohibited. As for leaving the DMZ to trade in traditional markets, only a small number of merchants whom the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities deem "reliable" are allowed.
    In this way, not only is the connection between the north and south of Vietnam cut off, but also the connection between the residents inside and outside the DMZ is cut off. Even within the DMZ, residents are not allowed to move freely. Their passes are only valid between five houses, and if anyone wants to step outside the range, they must obtain special permission from the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities.
    Nevertheless, residents often sneak across the Bian Hai River with banana branches or wooden boards. A temporary shelter north of the DMZ houses two hundred and fifty residents from the south. More than six thousand people who have fled to North Vietnam live in the Fenlin area. Why did they run away?
    A young woman whose home is on the south bank of the Bian Hai River said: "They forced me to take anti-communist classes three times a week. We don't even have time to farm, and we have to go hungry. If we don't go, we will be arrested. We can't live there."
    A wrinkled woman held a thin child in her arms, and another emaciated child with sunken cheeks stood beside her. She recounted how she was imprisoned for four months in the so-called "Report Communists" movement.
    After talking with many other people, I learned about the situation in the DMZ and the rest of Quang Nam Province: When the anti-Japanese government allocated public land, farmers received more than five plots of land. The Ngo Dinh Diem government first tried to take back all the allocated land, but under the strong resistance of the farmers, it changed to taking back three plots. However, the families of those who participated in the anti-Japanese war were only left with nine li of land per person (one fen equals fifteen li, ten fen equals one mu), and the land that was taken back was given to those who could afford the rent. Obviously, only landlords can afford to rent.
    A fisherman described the situation in the south, saying: "There is famine everywhere in the village, and we can't even eat miscellaneous grains, let alone rice!" In the area where he lives, men are forced to work for "national construction" for fifteen days a month without any remuneration. The so-called "national construction" is to build bunkers and barracks for the Ngo Dinh Diem army. In the past, thirty-five kilograms of public grain were paid to the anti-Japanese government every year, but now the total amount of various taxes is one hundred and fifty-five kilograms! Ten of the nineteen villages in the southern DMZ are suffering from famine. Among the people I spoke with was a child whose mother had died of starvation before she could escape. The return of landlords, anti-communist classes, and forced labor made it impossible for farmers to cultivate, and grain production plummeted. The prohibition of fishing, collecting forest products, and trade made it impossible for villagers to buy grain. Many refugees came from areas with slightly better economic conditions, but the oppression there was equally brutal. A young woman with a firm, brave, and enthusiastic appearance recounted how she was arrested by Ngo Dinh Diem's police for participating in women's groups during the anti-Japanese war. She said: "They tied my hands and feet behind my back with coconut stems and hung me upside down on a tree, beat me with sticks, and kicked my abdomen, demanding that I tell them the names of the communists in the village and the work I had done. They didn't give me anything to eat for nine days. Seeing that I was not going to survive, they sent someone to call my family to take me back, and they had to report to them as soon as I was able to stand trial. I knew they would kill me next time, so as soon as I could move, I ran away."
    These days, the "Highway Number One" north of the 17th parallel is bustling with traffic. There are trucks produced by the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Democratic Germany, and other countries. They are loaded with equipment for new seaports and power stations, equipment for pumping stations and irrigation projects, construction materials for roads and bridges, and also rails and signaling equipment for new railways—a railway has been built to Ningping and is extending towards the 17th parallel. At night, the ferry crossing is very lively, and the bridge is brightly lit with electric torches. Car drivers are waiting to cross the river, holding a bowl of the famous Vietnamese "soup" in their hands, chatting while drinking. Although they have just learned about the nightmare-like situation from people who have come from the other side of the 17th parallel—the pale faces and weak bodies of these people can fully confirm their words. But everything in front of them seems very normal. I also heard that these days the highways in the south are also busy. The roads are filled with American trucks dragging steel and cement, transporting them to the southern edge of the DMZ to build a network of bunkers. At the same time, truckloads of strong men are being transported to garrison the built bunkers.
    The Vietnamese people long for the day when the fishermen of Fen'an Village can exchange fishing boats for the sails and fishing nets of the people of Kasong Village, the families of Fenkesuo Village can be reunited, the railway bridge on the Bian Hai River will reopen, and people can travel north and south on "Highway Number One," from Hanoi to Saigon, and from Saigon to Hanoi.

    在边海河畔
    法国“人道报”记者　贝却敌
    从前法国人把河内和西贡间的道路称为“第一号殖民公路”。现在，这条路却在河内以南三百五十英里、西贡以北六百英里的边海河铁桥边中断了。
    边海河大体上在十七度线沿线，也就是南、北越的临时分界线，它把南部约一千万居民和北部的约一千三百万同胞截然分开。离边海河口以西二十三英里，是老挝的边境。边海河南北两边各三英里宽的地区，是双方的非军事区。按照日内瓦会议的协议，为了恢复和平和把越南建立成一个和平、统一、独立的国家，十七度线是双方的临时分界线，但是美国的政策却企图把边海河变为一条永久的分裂线。
    河两岸是稻田。两岸的农民穿着同样暗黄色的衣服，在田间锄草、犁地。边海河把广济省分为两半，汾林区的一半在河的北岸，另一半在南岸。北岸有一万二千户居民，南岸有一万户。在汾克索村，六个小村在北边，三个在南边。往往父亲和母亲住在这一边，他们的孩子住在那一边。在1955年7月以前，这种情况还没有感到不便，因为按照日内瓦协议，非军事区居民持有特别通行证，可以在非军事区内自由行动。在边海河两岸有渡船往来，居民也可以在这“第一号公路”的铁桥上自由通行。但在1955年7月，正当应该召开协商会议讨论统一越南的选举程序时，情况改变了。吴庭艳政权派遣了几股便衣警察，攻击了驻在那里的国际委员会。在非军事区南部禁止居民渡河，停发通行证，严禁边海河两边居民的任何接触。法国和吴庭艳的军官同时拒绝出席管理非军事区的特别联合小组会议。
    边海河流入口处，河北是汾安村，河南是卡松村。两个都是渔民村。汾安村人擅长造船，卡松村人精于做船帆和鱼网。过去，渔民们每天在海上相会，在一个生产队里捕鱼。但是在1955年7月以后，这种往来也被吴庭艳集团所禁止。7月27日，即是西贡的国际委员会遭受袭击后一星期，一个特务在深夜偷渡边海河，在汾安村纵火。烧毁了九十七间房屋。对岸的卡松村人曾不顾吴庭艳的军事警察的威胁和劝诱，乘船渡过河来帮助汾安村的渔民重建村庄。后来，汾安村的渔民为了表示他们的谢意，想在双方捕渔队在渔场上会见时送几袋大米给邻村的同伴，但是，南越当局却禁止卡松村的渔民下海；甚至把他们的船只都给拖走了。
    1955年9月2日，越南民主共和国成立十周年纪念日，非军事区南部的居民穿上最漂亮的衣服，站在边海河岸上，参加对岸同胞的纪念活动。
    在民族解放战争期间，汾林地区的南部是解放区，北部是敌占区。解放区实行了减租减息，属于帝国主义分子、民族叛徒的土地和公有荒地都分给了农民。居民的生活过得很好。在北部敌占区，生活情况极为凄惨。这个现在是非军事区北部的地区在整个战争中经历过几次最残酷的浩劫。在边海河铁桥到入海口的临河军事据点唐特莱据点附近，仅在1952年下半年，就在附近小山上屠杀了八百个爱国者，其中有二百个是劳动党党员。小山上的四棵歪脖子树被当作绞架。一个恐怖之夜，八十个爱国者被活埋在一个大坟中。战争的最后几年，边海河北岸的汾林地区有两、三千名爱国者遭到屠杀。
    “法军撤走以后，我们所碰到的最大的困难是饥荒和疾病，”区行政委员会主席说道。“普通农民六天只能吃到一餐大米饭，其余就吃山芋和杂粮。居民受着饥饿的熬煎，很大一部分人传染了占领者遗留下来的疟疾、砂眼和性病，田野里布满了铁丝网和地雷。农民们不能耕种。”
    土地改革、生产互助组和政府的帮助改变了这种局面。一万二千户中有三千户左右分得了土地，平均每人得三分地（约等于五分之一公顷）。在土地改革过程中，这里犯过错误，过去有二百六十人定为地主成份，现在已把其中的一百五十人改划为“中”农成份。有一万一千户参加了互助组，这里的农业生产已迅速上升。
    “去年全越南每个人的大米定额是六百六十磅，”委员会主席说道。“我们的土地很薄，每人平均收获五百五十磅大米。加上山芋和杂粮，主食可以超过一千磅。即使是最困难户一年也能吃到一半以上的大米。”
    一位女抗战英雄，现在的区委员会委员说道：“就在一年以前我们的衣服还是破破烂烂的，可是现在你再也找不出穿不上衣裳的人了。”事实确是这样。我到边海河地区的时候，寒流刚来到了中越。人民都穿着暖和的棉袄，和一年以前人们所看到的满身补绽恰成鲜明对照。主席说，砂眼、疟疾和性病已经消灭80％；扫盲班也取得了很大成绩，他们计划在1957年年底能够扫除文盲。
    边海河以南的人民的生活也发生了变化。南部居民除了种稻之外还有三种生活来源：捕鱼、采集木材、竹子和其他林产物，他们还可以在非军事区以南的一个中心市集上出卖手工业品。现在，捕鱼几乎被完全禁止，在严格限制的地区内鱼船的活动也要受到特务的监视。采集木材和林产物也被禁止了。至于离开非军事区到传统的市集上做买卖，也只有吴庭艳当局认为“可靠”的少数商人。
    这样，不仅是越南南、北两部之间的联系切断了，而且连非军事区内、外居民的联系也被切断。就是在非军事区内，居民也不准自由行动。他们的通行证只能在五幢房子之间有效，如果谁要越出范围一步，就必须得到吴庭艳当局的特别许可。
    尽管如此，居民们常常挟着芭蕉枝或木板偷渡边海河。在非军事区以北的一个临时收容站里就收容了二百五十个南部的居民。在汾林地区住着六千多个先后逃来北越的人。他们为什么要逃跑呢？
    一个家在边海河南岸的青年妇女说：“他们强迫我去上反共课，一星期三次。连耕田的时间也没有，我们还得挨饿。要是不去就要被抓走，我们在那里无法生活下去。”
    一位皱纹满面的妇女怀里抱着一个瘦得可怜的孩子，另外一个骨瘦如柴、两颊深陷的孩子站在她身边。她叙述她怎样在所谓“告发共产主义分子”运动中被关了四个月的监狱。
    我和另外许多人交谈后，了解到非军事区和广南省其余地区的情况：在抗战政府分配公地的时候，农民们分得五分多地。吴庭艳政府最先企图把分配的土地全部夺走，但在农民的强烈反抗下改为夺回三分土地。而参加抗战人员的家属，每人却只留九厘地（一分等于十五厘，十分等于一亩），把被夺回的土地交给付得起地租的人使用。显然只有地主才有钱租用。
    一个渔民叙述南部的情况说：“村子遍地饥荒，我们连杂粮也吃不上，不要说大米了！”在他居住的地区，男人每月被强迫为“国家建设”劳动十五天，没有任何报酬。所谓“国家建设”就是为吴庭艳军队建筑碉堡和兵营。过去每年给抗战政府交纳三十五公斤大米的公粮，现在各种赋税的总数字达一百五十五公斤！非军事区南部的十九个村子中有十个村闹饥荒。和我谈话的人中有一个小孩，他的母亲就是在未等逃跑以前饿死的。由于地主还乡、听反共课和强迫劳动，使农民无法耕作，粮食的产量激剧下降了。由于禁止捕鱼、采集林产物和贸易，村民也就无法购买粮食。许多难民来自经济条件稍好的地区，但那里的压迫同样地残酷。一个相貌坚毅、勇敢和热情的青年妇女叙述她怎样因为在抗战中曾参加妇女团体因而遭到吴庭艳警察的逮捕的经过。她说道：“他们把我的手和脚用椰子茎反绑在背后倒挂在树上，用棍子打我，用脚踢我的腹部，要我说出村里的共产党员的名字和我所做的工作。九天中他们什么也不给我吃。看看我活不成了，才差人叫我的家里人把我带回去，还要一等我能够受审就报告他们。我知道下一次他们要杀死我，所以刚能走动，马上就逃出来了。”
    这几天，从十七度线往北的“第一号公路”上车马如梭。有苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、民主德国等各国出产的卡车。满载着新建海港和发电站的装备，有抽水站和灌溉工程的装备，有公路和桥梁的建筑材料，也有新建铁路的路轨和信号设备——一条铁路已经修到宁平并正向十七度线延伸。夜晚，渡口景象十分热闹，桥上电炬通明。汽车司机在等待过河，手里端一碗有名的越南“汤”，一边喝一边交谈。虽然刚刚从十七度线那方来的人那里了解了恶梦般的情况——这些人的苍白脸色和衰弱不堪的身体可以充分证实他们的话。但是眼前的这一切却显得十分正常。我也听说这些日子南部的公路也在忙忙碌碌。公路上塞满了拖着钢骨水泥的美国卡车，运到非军事区南沿修筑碉堡网。与此同时，一车车的壮丁被载来据守造好的碉堡。
    越南人民渴望这一天的到来，那时汾安村的渔民又能以鱼船来交换卡松村人的船帆和鱼网，汾克索村的家庭又能团聚，边海河上的铁桥重新通车，而人民又可以在“第一号公路”上南来北往，从河内到西贡，从西贡到河内。
