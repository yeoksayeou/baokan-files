    On the Banks of the Bian Hai River
    By Bei Quedi, Reporter for the French Newspaper "L'Humanit√©"
    The French used to call the road between Hanoi and Saigon "Colonial Highway Number One." Now, this road is interrupted at the Bian Hai River railway bridge, 350 miles south of Hanoi and 600 miles north of Saigon.
    The Bian Hai River roughly follows the 17th parallel, which is the temporary dividing line between South and North Vietnam, separating approximately ten million residents in the south from about thirteen million compatriots in the north. Twenty-three miles west of the Bian Hai River estuary is the border of Laos. The area three miles wide on either side of the Bian Hai River is the demilitarized zone (DMZ). According to the Geneva Accords, the 17th parallel is a temporary dividing line for restoring peace and building Vietnam into a peaceful, unified, and independent nation, but American policy attempts to turn the Bian Hai River into a permanent dividing line.
    The riverbanks are rice paddies. Farmers on both banks wear the same dull yellow clothes, hoeing and plowing in the fields. The Bian Hai River divides Quang Tri Province into two halves, with one half of the Fenlin District on the north bank and the other on the south bank. There are 12,000 households on the north bank and 10,000 on the south bank. In Fenkesuo Village, six small villages are on the north side and three on the south side. Often fathers and mothers live on one side, while their children live on the other. Before July 1955, this situation did not feel inconvenient, because according to the Geneva Accords, residents of the DMZ held special passes and could move freely within the DMZ. Ferries operated on both sides of the Bian Hai River, and residents could also freely pass on the railway bridge of this "Highway Number One." But in July 1955, just when consultative conferences should have been held to discuss the election procedures for unifying Vietnam, the situation changed. The Ngo Dinh Diem regime dispatched several groups of plainclothes police to attack the International Commission stationed there. Residents in the southern DMZ were prohibited from crossing the river, passes were discontinued, and any contact between residents on both sides of the Bian Hai River was strictly forbidden. French and Ngo Dinh Diem officers simultaneously refused to attend special joint group meetings managing the DMZ.
    At the entrance of the Bian Hai River, Fen'an Village is on the north bank and Kasong Village is on the south bank. Both are fishing villages. The people of Fen'an Village are good at shipbuilding, and the people of Kasong Village are skilled in making sails and fishing nets. In the past, fishermen met at sea every day and fished in one production team. But after July 1955, this exchange was also prohibited by the Ngo Dinh Diem clique. On July 27th, one week after the International Commission in Saigon was attacked, a special agent secretly crossed the Bian Hai River at night and set fire to Fen'an Village, burning down ninety-seven houses. The people of Kasong Village on the opposite bank, disregarding the threats and persuasion of Ngo Dinh Diem's military police, crossed the river by boat to help the fishermen of Fen'an Village rebuild their village. Later, the fishermen of Fen'an Village, to express their gratitude, wanted to send a few bags of rice to their neighbors when the fishing teams from both sides met on the fishing grounds, but the South Vietnamese authorities forbade the fishermen of Kasong Village from going to sea; they even towed away their boats.
    On September 2, 1955, the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, residents in the southern DMZ wore their finest clothes and stood on the banks of the Bian Hai River to participate in the commemorative activities of their compatriots on the opposite bank.
    During the national liberation war, the southern part of the Fenlin area was a liberated area, and the northern part was an enemy-occupied area. The liberated area implemented rent reduction and interest reduction, and land belonging to imperialist elements and national traitors, as well as public wasteland, was distributed to the peasants. The residents lived well. In the northern enemy-occupied area, the living conditions were extremely miserable. The area, which is now the northern DMZ, experienced some of the most brutal disasters several times throughout the war. Near the Tangtelai military stronghold, a riverfront military stronghold near the Bian Hai River railway bridge to the estuary, eight hundred patriots were massacred on nearby hills in the second half of 1952 alone, two hundred of whom were members of the Labor Party. The four crooked-neck trees on the hill were used as gallows. On one night of terror, eighty patriots were buried alive in a large grave. In the last years of the war, two or three thousand patriots were massacred in the Fenlin area north of the Bian Hai River.
    "After the French troops withdrew, the biggest difficulties we encountered were famine and disease," said the chairman of the district administrative committee. "Ordinary peasants could only eat one meal of rice every six days, and the rest was sweet potatoes and miscellaneous grains. Residents suffered from starvation, and a large proportion of them contracted malaria, trachoma, and venereal diseases left behind by the occupiers. The fields were filled with barbed wire and landmines. The peasants could not cultivate."
    Land reform, production mutual aid teams, and government assistance changed this situation. About three thousand of the twelve thousand households were allocated land, averaging three plots per person (approximately one-fifth of a hectare). In the process of land reform, mistakes were made here. In the past, two hundred and sixty people were classified as landlord components, and now one hundred and fifty of them have been reclassified as "middle" peasant components. Eleven thousand households have joined mutual aid teams, and agricultural production here has risen rapidly.
    "Last year, the rice quota for each person in all of Vietnam was six hundred and sixty pounds," said the chairman of the committee. "Our land is thin, and each person harvests an average of five hundred and fifty pounds of rice. Adding sweet potatoes and miscellaneous grains, the staple food can exceed one thousand pounds. Even the most needy households can eat more than half rice a year."
    A female anti-Japanese war hero, now a member of the district committee, said: "Just a year ago, our clothes were ragged, but now you can no longer find people who can't afford clothes." This is indeed the case. When I arrived in the Bian Hai River area, a cold wave had just arrived in central Vietnam. People were wearing warm cotton-padded jackets, in stark contrast to the patched clothes that people had seen a year ago. The chairman said that trachoma, malaria, and venereal diseases have been eliminated by 80%; literacy classes have also achieved great results, and they plan to eliminate illiteracy by the end of 1957.
    The lives of the people south of the Bian Hai River have also changed. In addition to growing rice, residents in the south have three sources of livelihood: fishing, collecting wood, bamboo, and other forest products, and they can also sell handicrafts at a central market south of the DMZ. Now, fishing is almost completely prohibited, and the activities of fishing boats in strictly restricted areas are also subject to surveillance by special agents. Collecting wood and forest products is also prohibited. As for leaving the DMZ to trade in traditional markets, only a small number of merchants whom the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities deem "reliable" are allowed.
    In this way, not only is the connection between the north and south of Vietnam cut off, but also the connection between the residents inside and outside the DMZ is cut off. Even within the DMZ, residents are not allowed to move freely. Their passes are only valid between five houses, and if anyone wants to step outside the range, they must obtain special permission from the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities.
    Nevertheless, residents often sneak across the Bian Hai River with banana branches or wooden boards. A temporary shelter north of the DMZ houses two hundred and fifty residents from the south. More than six thousand people who have fled to North Vietnam live in the Fenlin area. Why did they run away?
    A young woman whose home is on the south bank of the Bian Hai River said: "They forced me to take anti-communist classes three times a week. We don't even have time to farm, and we have to go hungry. If we don't go, we will be arrested. We can't live there."
    A wrinkled woman held a thin child in her arms, and another emaciated child with sunken cheeks stood beside her. She recounted how she was imprisoned for four months in the so-called "Report Communists" movement.
    After talking with many other people, I learned about the situation in the DMZ and the rest of Quang Nam Province: When the anti-Japanese government allocated public land, farmers received more than five plots of land. The Ngo Dinh Diem government first tried to take back all the allocated land, but under the strong resistance of the farmers, it changed to taking back three plots. However, the families of those who participated in the anti-Japanese war were only left with nine li of land per person (one fen equals fifteen li, ten fen equals one mu), and the land that was taken back was given to those who could afford the rent. Obviously, only landlords can afford to rent.
    A fisherman described the situation in the south, saying: "There is famine everywhere in the village, and we can't even eat miscellaneous grains, let alone rice!" In the area where he lives, men are forced to work for "national construction" for fifteen days a month without any remuneration. The so-called "national construction" is to build bunkers and barracks for the Ngo Dinh Diem army. In the past, thirty-five kilograms of public grain were paid to the anti-Japanese government every year, but now the total amount of various taxes is one hundred and fifty-five kilograms! Ten of the nineteen villages in the southern DMZ are suffering from famine. Among the people I spoke with was a child whose mother had died of starvation before she could escape. The return of landlords, anti-communist classes, and forced labor made it impossible for farmers to cultivate, and grain production plummeted. The prohibition of fishing, collecting forest products, and trade made it impossible for villagers to buy grain. Many refugees came from areas with slightly better economic conditions, but the oppression there was equally brutal. A young woman with a firm, brave, and enthusiastic appearance recounted how she was arrested by Ngo Dinh Diem's police for participating in women's groups during the anti-Japanese war. She said: "They tied my hands and feet behind my back with coconut stems and hung me upside down on a tree, beat me with sticks, and kicked my abdomen, demanding that I tell them the names of the communists in the village and the work I had done. They didn't give me anything to eat for nine days. Seeing that I was not going to survive, they sent someone to call my family to take me back, and they had to report to them as soon as I was able to stand trial. I knew they would kill me next time, so as soon as I could move, I ran away."
    These days, the "Highway Number One" north of the 17th parallel is bustling with traffic. There are trucks produced by the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Democratic Germany, and other countries. They are loaded with equipment for new seaports and power stations, equipment for pumping stations and irrigation projects, construction materials for roads and bridges, and also rails and signaling equipment for new railways‚Äîa railway has been built to Ningping and is extending towards the 17th parallel. At night, the ferry crossing is very lively, and the bridge is brightly lit with electric torches. Car drivers are waiting to cross the river, holding a bowl of the famous Vietnamese "soup" in their hands, chatting while drinking. Although they have just learned about the nightmare-like situation from people who have come from the other side of the 17th parallel‚Äîthe pale faces and weak bodies of these people can fully confirm their words. But everything in front of them seems very normal. I also heard that these days the highways in the south are also busy. The roads are filled with American trucks dragging steel and cement, transporting them to the southern edge of the DMZ to build a network of bunkers. At the same time, truckloads of strong men are being transported to garrison the built bunkers.
    The Vietnamese people long for the day when the fishermen of Fen'an Village can exchange fishing boats for the sails and fishing nets of the people of Kasong Village, the families of Fenkesuo Village can be reunited, the railway bridge on the Bian Hai River will reopen, and people can travel north and south on "Highway Number One," from Hanoi to Saigon, and from Saigon to Hanoi.
