Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 31st - Agricultural cooperatives in the cotton-growing areas of Hebei Province are rationally adjusting the proportion of grain and cotton planting according to the state cotton planting plan. Although the cotton field area has slightly decreased, the total cotton production is expected to increase.

In the Handan, Xingtai, and Shijiazhuang prefectures, where cotton planting is relatively concentrated in this province, agricultural cooperatives have slightly reduced the cotton planting area this year based on local conditions. However, the yield per unit area and the total output can be maintained or exceed the highest actual output in the past. After preliminary investigation of counties and cooperatives in Shijiazhuang Prefecture, the cotton planting plans of the counties generally coincide with the prefecture's plan in all twenty-five counties in the district. In the eastern counties of Shulu, Ji, and Wuyi, which are suitable for cotton planting, the cotton fields have even increased compared to last year. In Nangong County, Xingtai Prefecture, where cotton fields account for about half of the cultivated land, the planned cotton planting area this year is more than 453,000 mu. Although this is 51,000 mu less than last year, due to the promotion of 100,000 mu of the superior Dai character cotton seeds this year, increased fertilizer application, and improved cultivation techniques, the average yield per mu will increase by 7 jin of ginned cotton compared to last year, and the total output is expected to increase by 740,000 jin compared to the highest output in 1955. Agricultural cooperatives that have completed the adjustment of planting plans are now harrowing the land and applying fertilizer, preparing for timely sowing.

Hebei Province's cotton fields have been expanding year by year. By 1956, they had expanded from more than 9 million mu in 1949 to more than 18 million mu, accounting for more than 13% of the province's cultivated land. However, some cotton fields often experience reduced yields and abandonment due to soil quality and topography. According to statistics from relevant departments, since 1952, the average annual area of cotton fields abandoned due to waterlogging disasters has been about 1.9 million mu. In addition, Hebei Province is one of the provinces with a shortage of grain, and forage grass is also a problem in cotton-growing areas. Therefore, this province has rationally adjusted the proportion of grain and cotton planting this year, converting land unsuitable for cotton planting to early-maturing, waterlogging-resistant, and high-yield crops. After the adjustment, the cotton planting area will be maintained at 15 million mu. Due to planned measures to increase the yield per unit area, the total output (ginned cotton) can be increased by more than 50 million jin compared to 1955.

### 河北省今年棉花总产量仍能增加

    河北省今年棉花总产量仍能增加
    新华社保定31日电　河北省棉区的农业社，正在按照国家植棉计划合理地调整粮棉种植比例，棉田面积虽然略有减少，棉花总产量预计仍能增加。
    这个省植棉比较集中的邯郸、邢台、石家庄等专区的农业社，根据当地具体条件，今年的棉花播种面积都稍有减少，但单位面积产量和总产量都能保持或超过过去最高的实产量。石家庄专区经过对县、社摸底了解，全区二十五个县中，县的植棉计划与专区计划基本相吻合，东部宜于植棉的束鹿、冀县、武邑三县棉田还比去年有所增加。棉田大约占耕地一半的邢台专区南宫县，今年计划植棉四十五万三千多亩，虽然比去年少种五万一千亩，但由于今年推广十万亩优良的岱字棉种，并且增施肥料和改进耕作技术，平均亩产量将比去年增加七斤皮棉，总产量预计将比产量最高的1955年增加七十四万斤。现在调整播种计划完成的农业社，正在耙地、施肥，准备适时播种。
    河北省的棉田逐年扩大，到1956年，已由1949年的九百多万亩扩大到一千八百多万亩，占全省耕地的13％以上。但其中有部分棉田由于土质和地势关系，常常减产和废弃，据有关部门统计，从1952年以来，仅因沥涝灾害废弃的棉田，平均每年都在一百九十万亩左右。另外，河北省是缺粮省份之一，棉区饲草也成问题。因此这个省今年合理的调整了粮棉种植比例，把不适于植棉的土地改种早熟、耐涝和高产作物。调整后，棉田播种面积将保持一千五百万亩，由于有计划地采取各种办法提高单位面积产量，总产量（皮棉）可比1955年增加五千多万斤。
