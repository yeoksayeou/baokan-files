Poland's Coal Mining Industry

Coal is Poland's main asset. The coal mining industry is the most important industrial sector in Poland's national economy. Poland's known coal reserves are about 80 billion tons. In terms of coal production, Poland currently ranks fifth in the world (after the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and West Germany), exceeding the total coal production of France, Italy, and Belgium. If calculated per capita, the amount of coal available to each person in Poland has increased from 1,099 kilograms in 1938 to 3,464 kilograms in 1955, exceeding the levels of the United States, West Germany, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and France.

In addition to supplying the needs of its own national economic development, Poland also exports a large amount of coal. It is now the largest coal exporter in Europe. From the time of liberation until 1954, Poland's total coal exports exceeded 200 million tons. These coal exports paid for 40% of the value of Poland's imported goods, earning Poland the various raw materials and supplies necessary for developing its national economy.

Before liberation, the vast majority of Poland's coal mines were controlled by foreign monopoly capitalists. During the two world wars, Poland never built a single coal mine. During World War II, the fascist occupiers severely damaged the machinery and technical equipment of many mines.

After the Polish people gained power, the coal mining industry received special attention from the Polish Party, government, and people. By the time the Three-Year Plan (1947-1949) for the postwar rehabilitation of the national economy was completed, Poland's annual coal production had increased to 80 million tons, more than double the pre-war level of 1938. In 1956, Poland's coal production was approaching 100 million tons.

The development of Poland's coal mining industry is not only reflected in the rapid increase in production, the reconstruction and expansion of old mines, and the commissioning of new mines, but also in the continuous improvement of mechanization and automation levels. According to Poland's current Five-Year Plan (1956-1960), mechanized coal mining in Poland will increase to 42% by 1960, mechanized coal loading will reach 70%, and mechanized coal transportation will reach 98%. By 1960, approximately 250 new coal mining combines will be put into production, and hydraulic coal mining methods will be further promoted.

The construction of Polish coal mines is proceeding in parallel with improvements in the social welfare facilities for miners. During the Six-Year Plan (1950-1955), in addition to the 60,000 houses newly built by the government for coal miners, the various coal mines themselves built 15,000 houses. According to the Five-Year Plan, miners will receive a total of 150,000 houses by 1960, and a number of rescue stations will be added in various places in terms of labor protection.

In order to increase coal production by 15.5 million tons during the Five-Year Plan period, according to Poland's Five-Year Plan, in addition to reconstructing and expanding a number of mines that have already been put into production, fifty shallow mines and twelve to fifteen deep mines will be newly built across the country before 1960. As for the cadres in the coal mining industry, in addition to the junior technical cadres trained in elementary mining schools, nearly 60,000 people will receive training through training courses held within the mines. In 1960, the number of engineers in Polish coal mines is expected to increase by 3,000, and the number of technicians will increase by 6,500. All of this will create conditions for Poland's coal mining industry to achieve the coal production targets set in the Five-Year Plan.　(Bai Zenghua) (Attached picture)

    波兰的采煤工业
    煤是波兰主要的财富。采煤工业在波兰的国民经济中是一个最重要的工业部门。波兰现在已知的煤炭蕴藏量约有八百亿吨。就煤的开采量来说，波兰现占世界第五位（次于苏联、美国、英国和西德），比法国、意大利和比利时这三个资本主义国家煤产量的总和还要多。如果按人口平均计算，波兰每人可能分到的煤已经从1938年的一千零九十九公斤增加到1955年的三千四百六十四公斤，超过了美国、西德、苏联、捷克斯洛伐克和法国的水平。
    波兰煤除了供应本国国民经济发展需要外，还有大量输出。现在它是欧洲最大的煤炭输出国。从解放后直到1954年期间，波兰煤的出口总量已经超过了两亿吨。这些煤的输出，支付了波兰进口物资价值的40％，为波兰换回了发展国民经济所必需的各种原料和物资。
    解放前，波兰绝大多数的煤矿都掌握在外国垄断资本家手里。在两次世界大战期间，波兰从未兴建过一个煤矿。第二次世界大战期间，法西斯占领者使许多矿井的机械和技术设备遭到了严重的破坏。
    在波兰人民取得政权后，煤矿工业受到了波兰的党、政府和人民的特别重视。在战后复兴国民经济的三年计划（1947年—1949年）完成时，波兰煤的年产量已增加到八千万吨，为战前1938年的两倍多。1956年，波兰的煤产量已经接近一亿吨。
    波兰采煤工业的发展不仅表现在产量的迅速提高，旧矿的改建、扩建和新矿的投入生产上，而且还表现在采煤机械化和自动化水平的不断提高上。根据波兰目前正在执行的五年计划（1956年—1960年）规定，1960年波兰的机械化采煤将要提高到42％，机械化装煤要达到70％，机械化运煤达到98％。到1960年，约有二百五十部新的采煤联合机将要投入生产，水力采煤法将进一步推广。
    波兰煤矿的建设，是和矿工们社会福利设施的改进同时进行着的。六年计划（1950年—1955年）期间，除政府为煤矿工人新建的六万间房屋外，各个煤矿自己还盖了一万五千间住房。根据五年计划规定，到1960年矿工们将总共得到十五万间住房，在劳动保护方面还将要在各地增设一批救护站。
    为了使采煤量能够在五年计划期间增加一千五百五十万吨，根据波兰五年计划规定，在1960年以前，除了要改建和扩建一批已经投入生产的矿井外，还要在全国新建五十个浅矿和十二个到十五个深矿。至于煤矿工业的干部，除了在初等矿务学校培养的初级技术干部以外，还有将近六万人将通过在矿场内所举办的训练班受到训练。1960年，波兰煤矿的工程师预计将增加三千人，技术员将增加六千五百人。所有这一切都将为波兰的采煤工业能够达到五年计划中所规定的煤产量而创造条件。　（白增华）（附图片）
