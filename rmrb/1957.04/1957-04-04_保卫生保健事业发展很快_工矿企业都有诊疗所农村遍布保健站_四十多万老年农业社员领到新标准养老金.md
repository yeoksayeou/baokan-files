　　Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 2nd -- Bulgaria's health and healthcare undertakings have developed rapidly since liberation.

　　Since 1951, all working people in the country have universally enjoyed free medical treatment. Last year, the total number of hospital beds in the country increased more than fourfold compared with 1939, and the number of doctors trained increased by about threefold. Now, every county and city has hospitals, and factories and mines have clinics. Before liberation, medical conditions in rural areas were the worst. In 1956, there were already more than 700 midwifery stations and more than 1,000 clinics in rural areas, and healthcare stations were universally established.

　　The state pays special attention to the prevention and treatment of various infectious diseases and medical work. Various prevention and treatment stations have been established throughout the country. Last year alone, the number of beds in sanatoriums for lung diseases increased fourfold compared with 1939.

　　There are more than 400 mineral spring areas in the country. Since liberation, the people's government has built a large number of sanatoriums, mineral spring clinics, and medical institutes in these places. In the past year alone, more than 350,000 adults and children have recovered their health in these mineral spring resorts.

　　Due to the development of healthcare undertakings, the population mortality rate has been greatly reduced. According to statistics from the government health department, the adult mortality rate has decreased from 13.4 per thousand in 1939 to 9 per thousand in 1955. The infant mortality rate has decreased from nearly 14% in 1939 to 7% in 1956.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 2nd -- About 400,000 elderly agricultural production cooperative members in Bulgaria received a total of 123 million leva in pensions in the first quarter of this year.

　　These elderly cooperative members received this sum of money based on a resolution passed by a special session of the National Assembly last year. The resolution stipulates that, starting from January 1, 1957, all women over 55 and men over 60 who have worked in agricultural cooperatives for 25 years or more will receive a monthly pension of 60 to 150 leva each, based on their working hours and labor contributions. Before this, according to the social insurance law enacted in 1948, they could only receive 20 leva per month each.

    保卫生保健事业发展很快
    工矿企业都有诊疗所农村遍布保健站
    四十多万老年农业社员领到新标准养老金
    新华社索非亚2日电　保加利亚的卫生保健事业自从解放以来有了迅速的发展。
    从1951年起，全国劳动人民已经普遍享受免费医疗的待遇。去年全国医院的床位总数比1939年增加了四倍多，培养出来的医生增加了大约三倍。现在各个县、市都设有医院，工矿企业里都设有诊疗所。解放前农村医疗条件最差。而在1956年，农村里已经有了七百个以上的接生站、一千多个诊疗所，并且普遍设立了保健站。
    国家特别注意各种传染病的防治和医疗工作。全国各地都建立了各种防治站。去年仅肺病疗养院的床位数就比1939年增加了四倍。
    全国共有四百多个矿泉区，解放以来，人民政权在这些地方修起了大批的疗养院、矿泉诊疗所和医疗院等。仅在去年一年，就有三十五万多成年人和儿童在这些矿泉疗养地恢复了健康。
    由于保健事业的发展，人口死亡率大大降低。根据政府卫生部门的统计材料，成年人的死亡率已经由1939年的千分之十三点四降低到1955年的千分之九。婴儿死亡率已经由1939年的接近14％下降到1956年的7％。
    据新华社索非亚2日电　保加利亚约有四十多万年老的农业生产合作社社员在今年第一季度里总共领到了一亿二千三百多万列弗的养老金。
    这些年老的合作社员是根据去年国民议会特别会议通过的一项决议得到这笔款项的。这项决议规定，从1957年1月1日起，所有在农业合作社工作满二十五年的五十五岁以上的妇女和六十岁以上的男子，根据劳动时间和劳动贡献，每人每月领取六十到一百五十列弗的养老金。在这以前，根据1948年制定的社会保险法，他们每人每月只能领到二十列弗。
