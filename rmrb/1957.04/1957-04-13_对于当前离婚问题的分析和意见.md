    Analysis and Opinions on the Current Divorce Problem
    You Tong
    Recently, some people have raised criticisms and opinions regarding the work of courts in handling divorce cases. This is beneficial for adjudicators to correct errors and improve their work. However, there are still some points worth discussing regarding the analysis and handling of divorce issues, namely: 1. Are marriage dispute cases increasing or decreasing? 2. What are the main reasons for divorce currently? 3. How should we understand and treat the divorce problem? 4. How should courts handle divorce cases?
    
    Are Marriage Dispute Cases Increasing or Decreasing?
    First of all, are marriage dispute cases increasing or decreasing? Some people believe that divorce cases are increasing rapidly based on the large proportion and rising proportion of marriage dispute cases (mainly divorce cases) in civil cases accepted by the courts, criticizing the courts for granting too many divorces and fueling this increasing trend. In fact, divorce cases are gradually decreasing, not increasing. The increase in the proportion of civil cases does not equal an increase in marriage dispute cases themselves. The size of the proportion is meaningless for explaining the increase or decrease of marriage dispute cases. Civil cases include disputes over land, debt, housing, etc. The total number of these cases has generally decreased year by year since 1953. In 1953, there were more than 1.85 million civil cases nationwide, including more than 1.17 million marriage dispute cases, accounting for 63.2% of the total. In 1954, the total number of civil cases decreased to more than 1.2 million, and marriage dispute cases decreased to more than 710,000, accounting for 58.84% of the total. In 1955, the total number of civil cases decreased to more than 950,000, and marriage dispute cases decreased to more than 610,000, accounting for 63.73% of the total. In 1956, the total number of civil cases decreased to more than 730,000, and marriage cases decreased to more than 510,000, accounting for 69.7% of the total. From this, it can be seen that the absolute number of marriage dispute cases is decreasing year by year. However, comparing 1953 and 1956, the former has more than twice as many marriage cases in absolute numbers as the latter, while the proportion of marriage cases in civil cases is greater in the latter than in the former. Therefore, it is meaningless to judge whether marriage dispute cases are increasing based on the size of the proportion and changes in the proportion. With a significant decrease in the total number of civil cases, land, debt, and other cases have decreased rapidly. Although marriage dispute cases have also decreased, they cannot decrease at the same rate due to their different nature from land, debt, and other issues, so naturally their proportion is larger. If we analyze whether marriage dispute cases are increasing based on statistical materials, we should compare their absolute numbers before and after. The situation from 1953 to 1956 mentioned above fully proves that the absolute number of divorce cases is decreasing year by year, not increasing, and there is no need to panic.
    
    What are the Main Reasons for Divorce Currently?
    Secondly, what are the main reasons for divorce currently? Some people believe that there are few feudal marriages, and most of those who are now filing for divorce are young women, so they believe that the main reason for divorce currently is that after the high tide of agricultural collectivization, especially after the transition from elementary cooperatives to advanced cooperatives, women have become economically independent, and "they want a divorce if they are slightly dissatisfied." Some people also believe that the main reason for divorce is the influence of bourgeois ideology. These views do not conform to the actual situation. I believe that there are various reasons for the current divorce phenomenon, but on a nationwide scale, the main reasons are still feudal marriage relationships and feudal remnants.
    
    Since the movement to implement the Marriage Law, marriage and family relationships have undergone tremendous changes based on the socialist revolution and socialist construction. The completely arranged marriage relationship by parents has transformed into a mostly autonomous or semi-autonomous marriage relationship, and the family relationship dominated by patriarchal and husband authority has transformed into a new family relationship of mostly equality, harmony, and active production. This is the main aspect of the current marriage and family relationship. This huge transformation proves the superiority of the new marriage system and also proves the superiority of the economic foundation of this system. However, the old feudal marriage relationships formed by the past feudal marriage system have not all been improved into harmonious family relationships after the promulgation of the Marriage Law. Problems such as concubinage and child brides that existed in the past have not all been reasonably resolved, and after the promulgation of the Marriage Law, many new feudal marriage relationships have continued to occur. Especially in some backward areas, feudal arranged marriages still account for about 70%. Even semi-autonomous marriages, and even some autonomous marriages, have not escaped the influence of the feudal marriage system and still contain feudal remnants. Therefore, feudal marriage relationships and feudal remnants are still the main reasons for marriage disputes. According to incomplete surveys from various places in the first half of 1956, in rural areas, those filing for divorce due to feudal arranged marriages generally account for about 50% of the total number of divorce cases. The thirteen courts in Chao County and Huainan, Anhui Province, averaged 53.5%; the Linchuan County Court in Jiangxi Province accounted for 53%; the two county courts in Jinning and Chuxiong, Yunnan Province, averaged 60%; the seventeen courts in Tongchuan, Liquan, and other places in Shaanxi Province averaged 64%; Sui County, Hubei Province, accounted for 63%; Minhou County, Fujian Province, accounted for 73%; the nine courts in Minhe, Ledu, and other places in Qinghai Province averaged 52.7%; the six county courts in Suiyang, Tongzi, and other places in Guizhou Province averaged 48.78%; the eleven county courts in Huaide and other places in Jilin Province averaged 41.3%; and the three courts in Lishui and other places in Zhejiang Province averaged 49% from July 1955 to June 1956. It is particularly worth pointing out that among the 535 divorce cases handled by the Feidong County Court in Anhui Province from 1955 to March 1956, 179 cases (accounting for 33.4%) were feudal arranged marriages after the promulgation of the Marriage Law. There are also many cases of "concubines" and child brides filing for divorce. For example, among the 400 divorce cases inspected by the Shanghai Higher People's Court in four district courts, "concubines" filing for divorce accounted for 16%, and among the divorce cases accepted by the Xinfeng County Court in Jiangxi Province from January to October 1956, child brides filing for divorce accounted for 23.9%.
    
    In addition, the feudal marriage system remnants of early marriage and the custom of demanding property are still relatively common in rural areas. There are still many early marriages where people marry before the legal age. Among the 19 divorce cases accepted by the Xinning County Court in Hunan Province from May to November 1956, 16 were early marriages below the legal age. Generally, people marry as soon as they reach the legal age. Under the feudal marriage system, regardless of age, marriages are arranged by parents, and individuals have no right to intervene, so the question of whether individuals have the ability to choose does not arise. However, with the implementation of marriage autonomy, if people marry early, it will inevitably lead to hasty marriages and consequently, divorce. Because young people do not have enough discernment ability to choose their spouses and do not have the courage to resist external interference, especially feudal customs, they marry hastily. After marriage, if they find that the other party is not good, they then demand a divorce. Although the feudal custom of the woman's parents or the woman herself asking the man for "property" has changed to some extent and in name compared to the past, it still exists in essence. Some parents still hold the idea that "they cannot raise their daughters for nothing" and demand property from the man in the name of "milk money," "milk feeding money," etc. According to a survey in Heilongjiang Province, among the 26 marriages in Baoan Village, Baoqing County, in the province in the past two years, 24 were arranged by parents who demanded so-called "milk money" through marriage. In Xianyang County, Shaanxi Province, in 1955, cases of forced marriage by parents for property, followed by divorce in the same year, accounted for 10% of the total divorce cases for the year. Some women, in order to "repay their parents' kindness," find someone who can give gifts, get engaged, receive the gifts, and then file for divorce after marriage.
    
    From the above situation, it can be seen that although the feudal marriage system no longer exists as a system, and autonomous and semi-autonomous marriages have become the mainstream in the new marriage relationship, it cannot be concluded that the main reason for the current divorce problem is not feudal marriage relationships and feudal remnants.
    
    The fact that the vast majority of those filing for divorce are young women did not occur after the high tide of the agricultural collectivization movement, but has existed since the anti-feudal marriage struggle during the implementation of the Marriage Law. After the high tide of agricultural collectivization, men and women became members of the cooperatives and received equal pay for equal work, which created more favorable conditions for women's marriage autonomy, that is, they could get rid of the influence of monetary and material conditions and decide their marriage issues. In other words, they no longer decide on marriage or divorce due to economic dependence but decide on marriage or divorce based on love relationships. After women become economically independent, there are more marriage relationships based on true love, and there are more truly equal, harmonious, united, and mutually supportive marital relationships. There will be fewer divorces caused by economic difficulties leading to family disputes and the breakdown of marital affection (in fact, this is already one of the reasons for the reduction in current divorce cases). Women who file for divorce after becoming economically independent do so because their marital relationship itself has problems, or the marriage itself is unreasonable, or there are flaws in family life, not because women are economically independent. If women's economic independence is regarded as the cause of divorce, or even the root cause, wouldn't it lead to the conclusion that in order to prevent divorce, we should oppose women's economic independence? This would create an excuse for feudal ideological remnants and have a harmful impact on the economic and political rights already obtained by women.
    
    As for the influence of bourgeois ideology, although it is the cause of some divorce problems, it is by no means the main reason for the overall divorce situation nationwide. Some young men and women marry autonomously, but soon after, they file for divorce, which cannot be said to be a flaw. However, this is difficult for young men and women, especially women, who have just been liberated from the shackles of the feudal system to completely avoid. Although they all oppose feudal marriage and demand freedom of marriage, many of them are not good at handling their marriages and are not good at choosing their spouses once they have obtained freedom of marriage because they used to live in a society dominated by the feudal marriage system for a long time. Naive psychology and passionate feelings easily make them lose their ability to distinguish and control, resulting in so-called hasty marriages. After marriage, if they find that the other party is not the person they are satisfied with, they will inevitably demand a divorce. It should be said that the emergence of these defects has social and historical roots and is a phenomenon that will inevitably arise in the process of opposing the feudal marriage system. It cannot be simply regarded as the influence of bourgeois ideology. Some women decide on marriage and divorce based on the other party's economic and material conditions because they have the idea of economic dependence on men, which should naturally be opposed. However, this kind of dependence for women, especially rural women, who have been oppressed by the feudal system for a long time and are economically unable to be independent, is still mainly a reflection of the past feudal system and is the influence of feudal ideological remnants. In the divorce problems of cadres, some are indeed due to the influence of bourgeois ideology. They do not have communist morality in marital relations, they do not have true and lasting love, they marry and divorce, divorce and marry, changing back and forth, and treat marriage as a child's play. Some people carry out illegal activities under the guise of legal marriage, and some people even take deceptive and illegal means to achieve the purpose of divorce. As a cadre of a country led by the working class, showing such corrupt ideas and behaviors should be considered a serious problem and should be criticized, educated, or adjudicated. However, such people are only a very small number. According to statistics from several district courts, cases of cadres requesting divorce account for less than 10% of the total number of divorce cases. Some of these are due to long-term bad feelings, developing into emotional breakdown and requesting divorce, and some are due to arranged marriages that were not built on the basis of love in the first place. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that all divorces filed by cadres are due to the influence of bourgeois ideology, let alone regard the influence of bourgeois ideology as the main reason for general divorce filings. Bourgeois ideology must be opposed, but at present, the main thing to oppose in marriage issues is still feudal ideological remnants. If we take opposing bourgeois ideology as the main thing, we will be giving bodyguards to feudal marriage relations and feudal ideological remnants, which is not conducive to the marriage freedom of the vast number of young men and women, especially women. In fact, there are many people who cannot stand marriage freedom, cannot stand gender equality, and use the excuse of opposing bourgeois ideology to actually be dominated by feudal consciousness and act as bodyguards for the feudal marriage system.
    
    How to Understand and Treat the Divorce Problem
    Third, how to understand and treat the divorce problem. Marriage is based on love. Feudal marriage relationships are not built on the basis of love, so they are not stable, and they themselves contain factors of separation. Since there are still a large number of old and new feudal marriage relationships and marriage relationships containing feudal factors in society, and it is impossible to improve them all, it is not surprising that feudal marriage and feudal remnants have become the main reasons for current divorces. In the future, as feudal marriage relationships decrease and disappear, the divorce phenomenon caused by feudal marriage will also decrease accordingly until it disappears. However, other divorce phenomena caused by changes in love cannot be eliminated, and it will be a long-term phenomenon. Some people do not recognize that marriage should be based on love at all, and they do not recognize that love may change. In their view, marriage has nothing to do with love, they oppose love in marriage as a bourgeois ideology, they interfere with the legitimate love of young men and women, and they do not allow divorce even when love has completely broken down. Although some people also recognize love in marriage, they believe that whether there is love and whether love can be maintained is not determined by the man and woman themselves but can be forcibly determined by external forces. In fact, the marriage relationships of the exploiting classes, whether feudal or bourgeois, whether arranged by parents or "free love," cannot escape the domination of conditions such as property and status, and they are not built on the basis of love, so they are unreasonable and unstable. The marriage relationship advocated by the proletariat is built on love that is not conditional on property or status. The proletariat has always opposed the marriage relationships of the exploiting classes that are based on property and status rather than love. Therefore, in their revolutionary struggle against the exploiting classes, they also resist the marriage system and marriage views of the exploiting classes. It should be said that marriage with true love is exactly what the proletariat advocates and practices. If we deny love in marriage, then it is meaningless to destroy the feudal marriage system and oppose the bourgeois marriage views.
    
    The love in proletarian marriage comes from the common struggle against exploitation and oppression and from the life of sharing weal and woe. It is built on the consistency of class consciousness, political ideology, common cause, and common labor. Therefore, this kind of love is precious and has lasting power. Cherishing love and maintaining the lasting power of love is precisely the morality that the proletariat values. This morality has become a recognized standard in our society. However, people's feelings are not absolutely unchanging. Even such solid love may change due to changes in certain subjective and objective conditions. For example, if conflicts occur in daily life and are not resolved in time or are not resolved well, they may develop to the point where they cannot tolerate each other, and feelings break down. It is unrealistic not to admit the possibility of this change. Therefore, this phenomenon not only exists now but will continue to exist in the future. Some people want to "control the divorce rate" or eliminate the divorce phenomenon, but this is just a subjective wish. Of course, we do not advocate divorce but advocate improving marital relationships and establishing equal, harmonious, united, and productive family relationships. However, divorce is a fact that cannot be eliminated and should not be opposed in all cases. When marital affection has completely broken down and they cannot continue to live together, this marital relationship exists in name only. Forcing them to maintain this nominal marital relationship is painful for both parties, for the children, and for the entire family. A painful family, as a cell that makes up society, is an unhealthy cell, which becomes a negative factor in social production. This is detrimental to the socialist revolution and socialist construction. In order to make the family a healthy cell in society and a positive factor in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, it is necessary to allow divorce for couples whose feelings have completely broken down and who cannot continue to live together in order to relieve this painful relationship. This kind of divorce is not harmful to society. Everyone knows that Engels once said: "If affection has disappeared..., then divorce is a blessing for both parties or for society." If both or one of the spouses files for divorce due to temporary anger or external influence, without a real change in affection or if the change in affection has not developed to the point of complete breakdown, this is a reckless attitude towards divorce and should be opposed because there is still a possibility of improving or consolidating this marital relationship. Therefore, divorce should not be opposed or supported across the board. There are cases where divorce should be granted and cases where it should not. The key to the decision lies in the degree of change in the marital relationship itself.
    
    How Should Courts Handle Divorce Cases
    Finally, how should courts handle divorce cases. In recent years, courts at all levels across the country, in the struggle to oppose feudal and bourgeois ideology with Marxism-Leninism and under the supervision of the people, have handled millions of divorce cases based on the Marriage Law and resolved marital disputes among vast numbers of men and women. In some of these cases, the marital relationship still had the possibility of reconciliation. After the court's earnest mediation and assistance, not only did they not divorce, but they also improved their marital relationship. In a considerable number of cases, although the court mediated many times, because their marital relationship had completely broken down and it was impossible to continue to live together, the court finally ruled for divorce, allowing both parties to be released from the painful marital relationship and establish a new marital relationship. The different approaches taken in these two different situations were all to make the marital and family relationship a new family relationship of equality, harmony, unity, and production, and a positive factor in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. At the same time, those who had immoral, illegal, or criminal behavior in their marital relationship were given criticism, education, and due punishment separately. This has played an active role in adjusting social marriage and family relationships. Of course, there are also shortcomings and errors in the handling of some cases.
    
    Whether the court grants or denies a divorce in each divorce case is based on whether the marital relationship itself has the possibility of reconciliation and whether the feelings of both parties have completely broken down. In essence, whether to divorce or not depends on the marital relationship itself, not on the subjective wishes of the court. Marx once said: "Judicial divorce can only be a record of the collapse within marriage." The court does not want people to divorce. When handling divorce cases, it first conducts mediation and tries to promote reconciliation as much as possible. However, when the marital relationship has already "collapsed" internally and mediation has no effect, it can only rule for divorce. The court cannot simply grant or deny a divorce based on feudal marriage or autonomous marriage, nor can it rule against divorce in order to oppose the impure ideological consciousness of the parties or mistakes made in gender issues, just as a doctor does not refuse to operate on a patient with appendicitis because the reason for getting appendicitis is that the patient eats too fast and too full. Facts have proven that regardless of whether it is a feudal marriage or a free marriage, and regardless of whether the parties have impure thoughts or have made mistakes, as long as the marital relationship has not developed to the point of complete breakdown after filing for divorce, there is a possibility of reconciliation. There are many cases where the marital relationship has been improved through court mediation and the divorce request has been withdrawn as a result. Conversely, regardless of the reason, when the feelings of both parties have completely broken down and it is impossible to continue to live together, the court's judgment against divorce becomes a useless piece of paper. In this case, the consequences of not ruling for divorce for a long time or ruling against divorce are not that the relationship between the two parties is improved, but that it deteriorates further, even evolving into one or both parties committing illegal acts, crimes, being punished, or going to prison. Legally speaking, the judgments of granting or denying a divorce can only be used as a means to decide the existence or elimination of the rights and obligations between the spouses and should not be used as a means to sanction erroneous thoughts or behaviors. Erroneous thoughts or behaviors should be handled separately according to their nature, circumstances, etc., and given criticism, education, punishment, and sanctions. Of course, when ruling for divorce, special consideration should be given to the economic interests of the woman and children.
    
    There are also some cases where, although mediation is ineffective for a while, it is correct to rule against divorce based on observations from all aspects that the marital relationship still has the possibility of reconciliation. There are also some cases where it cannot be determined for a while whether the marital relationship has completely broken down, and it is right not to rule for divorce in order to give both parties sufficient time to consider. In these cases, not ruling for divorce is used as a means to promote reconciliation between the two parties, which is completely different in nature from the practice of still not ruling for divorce when it is already known that reconciliation is impossible or of using not ruling for divorce as a means of sanctioning because the party filing for divorce has erroneous thoughts or behaviors.

    对于当前离婚问题的分析和意见
    幽桐
    近来有些人对于法院审理离婚案件的工作提出了批评和意见。这对于审判人员纠正错误、改进工作是有益的，但是在离婚问题的分析和处理意见上，还有几点值得商讨。即：一、婚姻纠纷案件是增加还是减少；二、当前离婚的主要原因是什么；三、怎样认识和对待离婚问题；四、法院应当怎样处理离婚案件。
    婚姻纠纷案件是增加还是减少
    首先，婚姻纠纷案件是增加还是减少。有些人根据法院受理的民事案件中婚姻纠纷案件（主要是离婚案件）的比重大和比重上升的情况，认为离婚案件增加得很历害，批评法院判决离婚多，助长了增加的趋势。其实离婚案件不是逐渐增加而是逐渐减少了。在民事案件中所占比重的增大，不等于婚姻纠纷案件本身的增加，比重大小对于说明婚姻纠纷案件的增减情况是没有意义的。民事案件包括土地、债务、房屋等纠纷。1953年以后这些案件的总数普遍地逐年下降，1953年全国民事案件有一百八十五万多件，其中婚姻纠纷案件有一百一十七万多件，占总数的63.2％；1954年民事案件总数下降到一百二十多万件，婚姻纠纷案件下降到七十一万多件，占总数的58.84％；1955年民事案件总数下降到九十五万多件，婚姻纠纷案件下降到六十一万多件，占总数的63.73％；1956年民事案件总数下降到七十三万多件，婚姻案件下降到五十一万多件，占总数的69.7％。从这里，可以看出婚姻纠纷案件的绝对数字是逐年减少的。但是，以1953年和1956年相比，在婚姻案件的绝对数字上，前者比后者多一倍以上，而婚姻案件在民事案件中所占的比重，则后者大于前者。因此，根据比重大小和比重的变化来判断婚姻纠纷案件是否增加，是毫无意义的。在民事案件总数大大下降的情况下，土地、债务等案件下降得很快，婚姻纠纷案件虽也减少，但由于它和土地、债务等问题具有不同的性质，不可能以同样速度下降，自然所占的比重就大了。如果根据统计材料来分析婚姻纠纷案件是否增长，应当拿它的前后绝对数字来比较。前面所举1953年到1956年的情况，充分证明离婚案件的绝对数字是逐年减少，而不是增加，没有什么惊惶的必要。
    当前离婚的主要原因是什么
    其次，当前离婚的主要原因是什么。有些人认为封建婚姻很少了，而现在提出离婚的又大多数是青年妇女，所以就认为当前离婚的主要原因是：农业合作化高潮发生以后，特别是初级社转入高级社后，妇女经济独立了，“稍不如意，则要离婚”；也有些人认为离婚的主要原因是由于资产阶级思想作祟。这些看法是不符合实际情况的。我认为当前离婚现象的产生有各种原因，但就全国范围来说，主要的仍然是封建婚姻关系和封建残余。
    从贯彻婚姻法运动以来，婚姻、家庭关系在社会主义革命与社会主义建设的基础上发生了巨大的变化。由完全的家长包办婚姻关系转变为绝大部分的自主或半自主的婚姻关系，由父权、夫权统治的家庭关系转变为大多数平等、和睦、积极生产的新家庭关系：这是目前婚姻家庭关系的主要方面。这种巨大的转变证明着新婚姻制度的优越性，也证明着这种制度的经济基础的优越性。但是，过去封建婚姻制度所形成的老的封建婚姻关系，在婚姻法颁布后，并不是都已经改善成了和睦的家庭关系，过去存在着的纳妾、童养媳等问题，也并不是都已得到合理的解决，而在婚姻法颁布后，也还有不少新的封建婚姻关系继续发生。特别是有些落后地区，封建包办婚姻还占70％左右。而半自主婚，甚至有些自主婚，也还没有摆脱封建婚姻制度的影响，还包含着封建残余的因素。因此，封建婚姻关系和封建残余还是婚姻纠纷的主要原因。根据各地1956年上半年不完全的调查，农村里属于封建包办婚姻而提出离婚的，一般地说占离婚案件总数的50％左右。安徽省巢县、淮南等十三个法院平均占53.5％，江西省临川县法院占53％，云南省晋宁、楚雄二个县法院平均占60％，陕西省铜川、醴泉等十七个法院平均占64％。湖北省随县占63％，福建省闽侯县占73％，青海省民和、乐都等九个法院平均占52.7％，贵州省绥阳、桐梓等六个县法院平均占48.78％，吉林省怀德等十一个县法院平均占41.3％，浙江省丽水等三个法院1955年7月至1956年6月平均占49％。特别值得指出的是安徽省肥东县法院从1955年到1956年3月处理的五百三十五件离婚案件中，竟有一百七十九件（占33.4％）是婚姻法公布后的封建包办婚姻。至于“妾”和童养媳提出离婚的也不少。例如上海市高级法院检查了四个区法院的四百件离婚案件中，“妾”提出离婚的占16％，江西省信丰县法院1956年1月至10月受理的离婚案件中，童养媳提出离婚的占23.9％。
    此外，封建婚姻制度残余的早婚和索要财物的习俗，现在在农村中还比较普遍地存在着。早婚中甚至不到法定年龄结婚的仍然不少，湖南省新宁县法院1956年5月至11月受理的十九件离婚案件中，即有十六件是不够法定年龄的早婚。一般也是刚到法定年龄就结婚。在封建婚姻制度下，不管年龄大小都由父母包办婚姻，本人无权过问，因而也就不发生本人有没有选择能力的问题；但是实行婚姻自主，如果结婚早，就必然产生轻率结婚并因而离婚的现象和后果。因为年龄小对于怎样选择自己的配偶没有足够的辨别能力，对于外力的干涉特别是对于封建习俗没有抵抗的勇气，因而草率结婚；结婚后，发现对方不好，就又要求离婚。女方家长或本人向男方要“财物”的封建习俗虽然比过去在程度上、名义上有所改变，而实质上还是存在着。有些父母仍然抱着“不能白白养活姑娘”的思想，用
  “奶金”、“奶水钱”等名义，向男方索要财物。根据黑龙江省调查，该省宝清县保安村近两年来二十六对结婚中，即有二十四对是由父母包办借婚姻关系索要所谓“奶金”的。陕西省咸阳县1955年因财物由父母强迫结婚，同年即提出离婚的占全年离婚案10％。有些女方为了“报父母恩”，找到能给财礼的人，订了婚，得到财礼，结婚后就提出离婚。
    从上述情况可以看出，虽然封建婚姻制度已经不再作为一个制度而存在，自主婚、半自主婚已经成为新的婚姻关系中的主流，但是不能因此就认为当前离婚问题的主要原因不是封建婚姻关系和封建残余。
    提出离婚的人，绝大多数是青年妇女这一事实，并不是在农业合作化运动高潮以后才发生的，而是从贯彻婚姻法运动以来反封建婚姻斗争中就一直存在着的。在农业合作化高潮后，男女同为社员，同工同酬，妇女进一步取得了经济独立，这给妇女的婚姻自主创造了更有利的条件。即能够摆脱金钱物质条件的影响而决定自己的婚姻问题。也就是不再由于经济生活的依赖性，决定结婚或者离婚，而是由于爱情关系决定结婚，或者决定离婚。在妇女经济独立后，真正以爱情为基础的婚姻关系就更多了，真正平等、和睦、团结、互助的夫妻关系也就更多了，由于经济困难，造成家庭纠纷，夫妻感情破裂因而提出离婚的也将更少了（事实上，这已经是现在离婚案件减少的原因之一）。妇女在经济独立后提出离婚的，是由于她们夫妻关系本身有问题，或者婚姻本身不合理，或者家庭生活有缺陷，而不是由于妇女经济独立。如果把妇女经济独立，当作发生离婚的原因，甚至当作根本原因，岂不就会引出这样的结论：为了预防离婚，就要反对妇女经济独立。这就给封建思想残余制造借口，对妇女们已经获得的经济、政治权利发生有害的影响。
    至于资产阶级思想作祟固然是某些离婚问题发生的原因，但就全国范围内总的离婚情况来看，它绝不是主要原因。有些青年男女自主结婚，婚后不久，又提出离婚，这不能不说是一种缺陷。但这是刚从封建制度的束缚下解放出来的青年男女特别是妇女很难完全避免的事情。因为他们虽然都反对封建婚姻，要求婚姻自由，但是由于过去生活在封建婚姻制度长期支配的社会里，一旦获得了婚姻自由，很多人还不善于处理自己的婚姻，还不善于选择自己的配偶，天真的心理，热烈的感情，容易使他们失掉辨别能力和控制力量，而发生所谓轻易结婚的情况。结婚后，发现对方不是自己满意的人，势不能不要求离婚。应该说这些缺陷的产生是有社会历史根源的，也正是反封建婚姻制度的过程中必然会产生的现象，不能简单地认为资产阶级思想作祟。也有些妇女由于在经济上存在着依赖男方思想，因而从对方经济、物质条件出发来决定结婚、离婚问题，这自然是应当反对的；但是这种依赖思想对于长期受封建制度压迫，经济上不能独立的妇女，特别是农村妇女来说，仍然主要是过去封建制度的反映，是封建思想残余作祟。在干部离婚问题中，有些的确是由于资产阶级思想作祟，他们在婚姻关系上没有共产主义道德，没有真实的持久的爱情，结了离，离了结，换来换去，把婚姻当作儿戏。有的人在合法婚姻的掩护下，进行非法活动，有的人为达到离婚目的竟采取欺骗违法等恶劣手段。作为一个工人阶级领导的国家的干部而表现着这样腐朽的思想和行为，应当认为是严重的问题，应当受到批评教育或裁判，但是这样的人究竟是极少数。根据几个地区法院的统计，干部要求离婚的案件在离婚案件的总数中，还不到10％，其中还有的是由于长期感情不好，发展到感情破裂而提出离婚的，也有的是由于原来就是没有建筑在爱情基础上的包办婚姻而提出离婚的。因此，不能够认为干部提出离婚都是资产阶级思想作祟，更不能把资产阶级思想作祟作为一般提出离婚的主要原因。资产阶级思想是必须反对的，但目前在婚姻问题上主要还是应当反对封建思想残余。如果把反对资产阶级思想作为主要的，就会给封建婚姻关系和封建思想残余作了镖师，对广大青年男女，特别是妇女的婚姻自由是不利的。事实上，看不惯婚姻自由，看不惯男女平等，借口反对资产阶级思想，实际上受封建意识支配，为封建婚姻制度保镖的，就大有人在。
    怎样认识和对待离婚问题
    第三、怎样认识和对待离婚问题。婚姻是以爱情为基础的，封建婚姻关系不是建立在爱情基础上的，因而是不稳固的，它本身就包含着分离的因素。目前社会上既然还大量存在着老的新的封建婚姻关系和包含着封建因素的婚姻关系，而又不可能都改善得好，那么封建婚姻和封建残余成为当前离婚的主要原因是并不奇怪的。今后随着封建婚姻关系的减少和消灭，由于封建婚姻产生的离婚现象也将相应地减少，直到消灭。但是由于爱情变化而发生的其他离婚现象还不能够消灭，它将是长期存在着的现象。有些人根本不承认婚姻应当以爱情为基础，也不承认爱情是可能有变化的。在他们看来，婚姻无所谓爱情，把婚姻上的爱情当作资产阶级思想来反对，对于正当的青年男女的恋爱加以干涉，对于爱情已经完全破裂了的也不许离婚。有些人虽然也承认婚姻上的爱情，但认为有没有爱情和爱情能不能维持不是决定于男女双方本身，而是可以由外力强制决定的。其实剥削阶级的婚姻关系，不论封建阶级或资产阶级，不论父母包办或“自由恋爱”，都不能摆脱财产和地位等条件的支配，都不是建立在爱情的基础上，所以是不合理的，不稳固的。无产阶级所主张的婚姻关系是建立在不以财产、地位为条件的爱情上面的，无产阶级从来就反对剥削阶级不以爱情而以财产、地位为基础的婚姻关系，因此在他们反抗剥削阶级的革命斗争中同时就反抗剥削阶级的婚姻制度和婚姻观点。应该说，具有真正爱情的婚姻正是无产阶级所主张和实行的。如果否认婚姻上的爱情，那么，摧毁封建婚姻制度、反对资产阶级婚姻观点就没有意义了。
    无产阶级婚姻上的爱情是从反对剥削、压迫的共同斗争中，从同甘苦共患难的生活中产生出来的，是建立在阶级意识、政治思想、共同事业、共同劳动的一致性上面。因此这种爱情是可贵的，也是有持久性的。珍贵爱情，保持爱情的持久性，正是无产阶级所重视的道德。这种道德在我们的社会中已经成为公认的标准。但是人的感情不是绝对没有变化的，即使是这样巩固的爱情，也可能因某些主观、客观条件的变化而引起变化。例如，在日常生活中发生矛盾，解决得不及时或解决得不好，以致发展到不能互相容忍，感情破裂。不承认这种变化的可能性是不实际的。因此，这种现象不仅现在必然存在，将来也还会继续存在。有些人想“控制离婚面”或消灭离婚现象，不过是主观的愿望。当然我们并不提倡离婚而是提倡改善夫妻关系，建立平等、和睦、团结、生产的家庭关系。但是离婚是事实上不可能消灭的，也不是在任何情况下都应当反对的。当着夫妻感情完全破裂不能继续共同生活下去的时候，这种夫妻关系便是名存实亡，勉强维持这种名义上的夫妻关系，对双方、对子女、对整个家庭都是痛苦的。痛苦的家庭作为社会上组成的细胞来说，就是不健康的细胞，也就成了社会生产上的消极因素。这对于社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业都是不利的。为了使家庭成为社会上健全的细胞，成为社会主义革命与社会主义建设事业上的积极因素，对于感情完全破裂，不能继续共同生活下去的夫妻，准许离婚以解除这种痛苦的关系便成为必要。这种离婚对于社会并无害处。大家都知道恩格斯曾说过：“要是感情已经消失……，那么离婚，无论对于双方或对于社会就都成为幸事了。”如果夫妻双方或一方由于一时气愤或者由于外部影响，没有真正发生感情变化或者感情变化没有发展到完全破裂，而提出离婚，这才是对离婚采取轻率态度，应当反对，因为这种夫妻关系还有改善或巩固的可能。因此，对于离婚不应当一律反对，或一律支持，有应当离的，有不应当离的，其决定关键在于夫妻关系本身的变化程度。
    法院应当怎样处理离婚案件
    最后，法院应当怎样处理离婚案件。几年来，全国各级法院在以马克思列宁主义思想反对封建思想和资产阶级思想的斗争中，在人民群众的监督下，根据婚姻法处理了几百万离婚案件，解决了广大男女间的婚姻纠纷。其中有一部分是夫妻关系还有和好可能的，经过法院认真地调解、帮助，不但没有离婚而且改善了夫妻关系，还有相当大的一部分，虽然经过法院多次调解，但因为他们夫妻关系已经完全破裂，不可能继续共同生活的，最后判决了离婚，使双方解除了痛苦的夫妻关系，再建立新的夫妻关系。对这两种不同情况所采取的不同作法都是为了使夫妻、家庭关系成为平等、和睦、团结生产的新家庭关系，成为社会主义革命与社会主义建设上的积极因素，同时对于一些在婚姻关系上，有不道德、违法、犯罪行为的，分别给予了批评、教育和应有的处分。这是在调整社会婚姻家庭关系上起了积极作用的。当然对有些案件的审理也存在着缺点和错误。
    法院对于每个离婚案件判离或不判离是根据夫妻关系本身有无和好的可能，双方感情是否完全破裂而定的，从实质上说离与不离决定于夫妻关系本身，而不决定于法院的主观愿望。马克思曾经说过：“司法上的离婚，只能是婚姻内部崩溃的记录。”法院并不愿意人们离婚，在处理离婚案件时首先进行调解，尽可能促成和好，但是当夫妻关系内部已经“崩溃”，调解绝无效果的时候，只能判离。法院不能简单地根据封建婚姻或自主婚姻而判离或不判离，也不能为了反对当事人思想意识不纯或在男女问题上犯了错误而判决不离，正像医生对于盲肠炎患者动手术一样，不能因为得盲肠炎的原因在于病人吃饭太快太饱而不给他动手术。事实证明，不论是封建婚姻或自由婚姻，也不论当事人是否思想不纯或犯了错误，提出离婚后，只要夫妻关系没有发展到完全破裂的程度，都有和好的可能，经过法院调解改善了夫妻关系因而撤销离婚要求的并不少。相反地，不管由于什么原因造成，在双方感情已经完全破裂，不可能继续共同生活下去的时候，法院不准离婚的判决便成了无用的废纸。在这种情况下，长期不判决离婚，或判决不离婚的后果，双方关系不是得到改善，而是更加恶化，甚至演成一方或双方违法、犯罪、受处分、坐监狱的恶果。从法律上说，准离和不准离的判决只能用作决定夫妻间权利义务的存在或消灭的手段，而不应当用作制裁错误思想或行为的手段。对于错误思想或行为，应当按照它的性质、情节等另行处理，给以批评、教育、处分、制裁。当然，在判决离婚的时候，对女方和子女的经济利益应特别给予照顾。
    也有些案件虽然一时调解无效，但从各方面观察，夫妻关系还有和好的可能，判决不离是正确的。也有一些案件一时还不能断定夫妻关系是否已经完全破裂，为了给双方有充分考虑的时间，不判决离婚也是对的。在这些情况下，不判决离婚是当作促进双方和好的手段而运用的，这和那种已经知道不可能和好而仍不判离的作法，或因提出离婚的一方有错误思想或行为而把不判离婚作为制裁手段的作法，在性质上是完全不同的。
