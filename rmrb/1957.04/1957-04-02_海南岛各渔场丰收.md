Hainan Island's various fishing grounds are reporting bumper harvests during the spring fishing season. The Lingo County tow-boat vessels operating in the deep sea of the Qizhou Ocean are catching up to 78 *shi dan* of fish per net, an increase of 30% to 50% compared to the same period last year. The tow-boat vessels of the Ganchong Port Collective Fishery Society of Dan County, operating in the offshore waters of Ganen, are catching an average of 50 *shi dan* of fish per net, with a maximum of 85 *shi dan* per net, of which the economically valuable redfish accounts for 50%. The catch of *shui gan yu* (also known as sardine) in Puqian Port (shallow sea) of Wenchang County this year has increased by about two times compared to previous years. Fishing boats from Donggang Township in Qiongshan County have recently concentrated on fishing for *shui gan yu* in Puqian Port. According to statistics from 32 fishing boats, a total of 11,600 *shi dan* of *shui gan yu* were caught in one month, worth 111,100 yuan, averaging more than 3,000 yuan per boat, with the highest earning boat bringing in 6,000 yuan.

Since the Spring Festival this year, all parts of Hainan Island have strengthened their leadership over fisheries and paid attention to implementing the policy of giving equal importance to deep-sea and shallow-sea operations. The Hainan Aquatic Products Bureau has transferred 70% of its cadres to various deep-sea and shallow-sea fishing grounds. Counties, districts, and townships have also transferred 80% of their cadres to various fishing ports to guide production. (Long Ju)

Xinhua News Agency reports: Dozens of fishing boats that were angling for redfish at the Wanglou fishing ground in the Beibu Gulf of Hainan Island have recently returned to port fully loaded. In the past, each fishing boat only caught a few dozen *dan* in one operation (ten to fifteen days), but this time they all reached 150 to 160 *dan*. The fishermen all said: There are too many redfish this year, and the fish often bite as soon as the line is cast.

In the past six months, good news of bumper harvests of redfish and red threadfin bream has also been constantly coming from the Ganen fishing ground and the Xiawaihai fishing ground. More than 1,000 trawlers are gathered in these two fishing grounds. Each pair of fishing boats hauls in more than 80 to 90 *dan* in one net.

The redfish and red threadfin bream produced in Hainan Island are all tropical fish of economic value. The meat of the redfish is delicious and can be made into dried products for sale throughout the country.

    海南岛各渔场丰收
    本报讯　海南岛春季渔汛中，各个渔场普告丰收。在七洲洋深海作业的临高县拖风船，每网捕鱼高达七十八市担，比去年同期增产30％到50％。儋县干冲港群集渔业社的拖风船，在感恩外海拖风作业，每网捕鱼平均有五十市担，最高每网可获八十五市担，而具有经济价值的红鱼占50％。文昌县铺前港（浅海）今年捕获的水干鱼（又名鰯鱼），比往年增加了两倍左右。琼山县东港乡的渔船，近来集中在铺前港捕鱼，据三十二只渔船统计，一个月共捕获水干鱼一万一千六百市担，值人民币十一万一千多元，计每只船平均收入三千多元，最高的一只船收入六千元。
    今年春节过后，海南岛各地对渔业都加强了领导，并注意贯彻深海和浅海作业并重的方针。海南水产局曾经抽调70％的干部，分赴各个深海和浅海作业的渔场。各县、区、乡也抽80％的干部到各渔港指导生产。　（龙驹）
    据新华社讯　在海南岛北部湾望楼渔场钓红鱼的几十艘鱼船，最近都满载回港。过去每艘渔船一流水（十天到十五天）只捕到几十担，这次都达到了一百五六十担。渔民们都说：今年的红鱼太多了，往往鱼钓刚放下，鱼便吃上了。
    近半年来，感恩渔场和下外海渔场也不断传来红鱼和红线鱼丰收的喜讯。云集在这两个渔场的有一千多艘拖网渔船。每对渔船下一次网，渔获量往往超过八九十担。
    海南岛出产的红鱼和红线鱼，都是具有经济价值的热带鱼类。红鱼的肉鲜美，可以制成干品，运销各地。
