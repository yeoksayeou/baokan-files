Xinhua News Agency, Liaocheng, 27th: One hundred and fifteen agricultural cooperatives in Fan County, Shandong Province, have strengthened unity and increased the enthusiasm of their members to strive for a bumper harvest this year after seriously addressing internal contradictions. According to investigations, the attendance rate of members during spring plowing has reached over 95%.

Last year, some agricultural cooperatives in the county had some shortcomings in their management due to the lack of experience of the cooperative cadres. Coupled with reduced production in some cooperatives due to natural disasters, some members experienced a decrease in income. As a result, some cooperatives experienced incidents of members causing trouble and withdrawing their cattle from the cooperatives since last winter. In order to correctly solve these problems, the Fan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party dispatched 325 cadres from county and district offices this spring to form inspection teams and visiting groups to go deep into the cooperatives to assist township and cooperative cadres in their work. In the Longwangzhuang, Yangji, and Zhangzhuang districts, which suffered from floods last year, 347 households of cooperative members in some cooperatives requested to withdraw from the cooperatives this spring, and more than 850 households were ideologically shaken. With the help of resident cadres and work teams, these cooperatives conducted political and ideological education for the vast number of members, and analyzed the reasons for the reduction in income for those members, explaining the prospects for the development of production in the cooperatives. On the basis of improving the awareness of the members, seventy-six households of members who had genuine difficulties in life were resettled by returning investment, pre-allocating work points, paying for manure, and providing social relief, and all expressed that they would not withdraw from the cooperatives.

Many cooperatives have adopted the method of convening member representative meetings and resolving issues through democratic consultation when dealing with various internal problems. The agricultural cooperatives in the Rongzhuang and Taitou townships of the Chalou district, based on the opinions discussed and consulted by the member representatives, reasonably adjusted the land cultivated by each production team, cleared up the property of the cooperative and teams, stipulated a system of announcing accounts on time, and distributed the surplus grain and cash that should be distributed to the members in a timely manner. For some middle-peasant members whose livestock and farm tools were undervalued or not valued when they joined the cooperative, the prices were re-evaluated and a repayment date was set. Some cooperative cadres with shortcomings in their work style also made self-criticisms to the members and improved their actions. As a result, a new atmosphere of unity and production has emerged in all cooperatives.

    山东范县农业社认真处理内部矛盾
    出现团结生产的新气象
    新华社聊城27日电　山东省范县的一百一十五个农业社，经过认真处理内部矛盾以后，各社团结加强，社员争取今年大丰收的积极性很高。据调查，在春耕生产中，社员出勤率都达到95％以上。
    去年，这个县有一部分农业社，由于社干部缺乏经营管理经验，在办社上有些缺点，又加部分社遭灾减产，有一些社员减少了收入，因此从去冬以来，有些社便出现了社员闹事、拉牛出社的现象。为了正确地解决这些问题，中共范县县委会，在今春从县区机关抽调三百二十五名干部，组成检查组、访问团，深入各社协助乡、社干部工作。去年遭受水灾的龙王庄、杨集、张庄等区的部分合作社，今春曾有三百四十七户社员要求退社，另有八百五十多户思想动摇。这些社在驻社干部和工作组的帮助下，向广大社员进行了政治思想教育，逐户帮助减少收入的社员分析原因，讲解了合作社发展生产的前途。在社员觉悟提高的基础上，对生活确有困难的七十六户社员，分别采取归还投资、预支工分、粪价和社会救济的办法，进行了安置，结果都表示不出社了。
    许多社在处理社内各种问题时，多是采取召开社员代表大会，用民主协商的办法解决。岔楼区的荣庄、台头等四个乡的农业社，根据社员代表大会讨论和协商的意见，合理地调整了各生产队耕种的土地，清查了社和队的财产，规定了按时公布账目的制度，并把应该分给社员的余粮、现款都及时分给社员；对部分中农社员入社的牲畜、农具等折价偏低或没有折价的，重新评议作价，并规定了偿还日期；部分作风有缺点的社干部，也向社员作了检讨，并在行动上有了改进。因此，各社都出现了团结生产的新气象。
