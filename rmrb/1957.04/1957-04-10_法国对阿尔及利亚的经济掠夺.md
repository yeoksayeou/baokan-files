France's Economic Plunder of Algeria

French colonialists have always liked to talk about their "achievements" in Algeria. However, what kind of "achievements" are these? The French newspapers provide a good explanation for this, which is the brutal economic plunder of Algeria by France; it should be noted that this is only part of the economic plunder of Algeria by France.

Algeria's industry is underdeveloped because French colonialists mainly regard it as their industrial raw material base and industrial product sales market. At present, Algeria's main industrial and mining industries, such as phosphate, lead, iron, zinc and other mining industries and the tobacco industry, are almost entirely monopolized by several major French colonial groups such as Ouonsha, Constantine, Mokta-el-Hadid, Miliana and Penarroya. The Ouonsha Iron Ore Company monopolizes 80% of iron ore production; the Constantine Phosphate Company monopolizes 80% of phosphate production; another three major companies monopolize 75% of lead production; and two major companies monopolize 80% of zinc sulfide ore and zinc carbonate production. As for the tobacco industry, it is exclusively occupied by the French Tobacco, Cigarette and Cigar Company. French companies in Algeria are concentrated in the hands of a very small number of financial groups, such as: Banque de l'Union Parisienne, Rothschild Bank, Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas, Mirabaud-Mare Bank and the Mining Committee.

French monopoly capital's investment in North Africa accounts for 40% of France's total foreign investment, ranking first; among the investments in North Africa, Algeria ranks first. From 1949 to 1954, France invested 968 billion francs in North Africa, of which 145 billion was invested in Tunisia (accounting for 15%); 372 billion was invested in Morocco (accounting for 38%); and 451 billion was invested in Algeria (accounting for 47%). France's investment in Algeria over the years is as follows: 1.6 billion in 1945; 4.8 billion in 1946; 43.5 billion in 1951; and 53 billion from 1955 to 1956, equivalent to 33 times the investment in 1945.

French monopoly capital obtains huge profits in Algeria every year. According to figures released by some companies, the profits of fourteen companies increased from 413 million francs to 2.752 billion francs from 1947 to 1951, an increase of 6.7 times. Twenty-four companies increased from 460 million francs to 6.58 billion francs from 1947 to 1953, an increase of 14.3 times. The annual profit of Ouonsha Company reached 2.5 billion francs; the annual profit of Mokta-el-Hadid Company was nearly 1 billion francs; and the annual profit of Tobacco, Cigarette and Cigar Company reached 400 million francs.

French colonial rulers also occupy most of the good land in Algeria. Among the 20 million hectares of arable land in Algeria, the colonialists occupied 11.6 million hectares, leaving the barren land for Algerians to cultivate. Some large companies, such as the Algerian Company, occupy 70,000 hectares of land, and the Geneva Company occupies 20,000 hectares. In terms of agricultural production, according to statistics, 6,000 French colonialists obtained one-half of Algeria's total agricultural products.

Algeria's agriculture has typical colonial characteristics, and agricultural production almost entirely serves the economic interests of French monopoly capital. French landlords do not allow Algerian farmers to produce a large amount of grain they need, but widely plant grapes for wine making in order to export them. Today, grape production accounts for one-third of Algeria's total agricultural output value. 90% of other products such as fruits and vegetables are also owned by the French.

Due to the long-term brutal exploitation by French colonialists, the lives of the Algerian people are becoming increasingly impoverished. An Algerian farmer harvests less than 200 kilograms of grain per year. There are 1.5 million to 2 million unemployed and semi-unemployed people in Algeria, and nearly 3 million people are often starving.

In trade, more than 70% of Algeria's trade is conducted with France. French monopoly capital purchases a large amount of mineral and agricultural raw materials at low prices and imports industrial finished products at high prices. In 1955, France exported 200 billion francs worth of goods to Algeria; Algeria exported 130.5 billion francs worth of goods to France.

In other aspects, such as tariffs, banking, commerce, and transportation, they are also mostly controlled by France, which obtains huge profits from them.

### 法国对阿尔及利亚的经济掠夺

    法国对阿尔及利亚的经济掠夺
    法国殖民主义者一向喜欢高谈他们在阿尔及利亚的“成就”，然而这究竟是一种什么样的“成就”呢？法国的报刊为它提供了很好的解释，那就是法国对阿尔及利亚进行的残酷的经济掠夺；需要说明的是这还只是法国对阿尔及利亚进行经济掠夺的一部分情况。
    阿尔及利亚的工业不发达，因为法国殖民者主要把它当作自己的工业原料基地和工业品的销售市场。目前，阿尔及利亚主要的工矿业例如磷酸盐、铅、铁、锌等采矿工业和制烟工业几乎全部为法国殖民集团的乌翁沙、君士坦丁、莫可达—阿迪、米里阿那和庞纳罗雅等几家大公司所垄断。乌翁沙铁矿公司垄断了铁矿砂生产的80％；君士坦丁磷酸盐公司垄断了亚磷酸盐生产的80％；另有三家大公司垄断了铅生产的75％；二家大公司垄断了硫化锌矿砂和碳酸锌生产的80％。至于制烟工业则为法国烟草、纸烟、雪茄公司独占。法国在阿尔及利亚的公司都集中在为数极少的几个金融集团手里，如：巴黎联合银行、洛希尔银行、巴黎荷兰银行、米拉波—马雷银行和矿业委员会等。
    法国垄断资本在北非的投资为法国全部国外投资的40％，占第一位；在北非的投资中又以阿尔及利亚占第一位。自1949年至1954年间，法国在北非投资为九千六百八十亿法郎，其中对突尼斯一千四百五十亿（占15％）；对摩洛哥三千七百二十亿（占38％）；而对阿尔及利亚则为四千五百一十亿（占47％）。法国对阿尔及利亚历年投资的情况是：1945年十六亿；1946年四十八亿；1951年四百三十五亿；而1955年至1956年为五百三十亿，相当于1945年投资的三十三倍。
    法国垄断资本在阿尔及利亚每年获得了巨额利润。根据一些公司公布的数字，有十四家公司的利润，自1947年到1951年，从四亿一千三百万法郎增加到二十七亿五千二百万法郎，增加了六点七倍。有二十四家公司自1947年到1953年，从四亿六千万法郎增加到六十五亿八千万法郎，增加了十四点三倍。乌翁沙公司每年的利润达二十五亿法郎；莫可达—阿迪公司每年的利润近十亿法郎；烟草、纸烟、雪茄公司每年的利润达四亿法郎。
    法国殖民统治者还在阿尔及利亚占据着大部良好的土地。在阿尔及利亚二千万公顷的可耕地当中，殖民者就侵占着一千一百六十万公顷，剩下那些贫瘠的土地归阿尔及利亚人耕种。而某些大公司，如阿尔及利亚公司占有七万公顷土地，日内瓦公司占有二万公顷。在农业生产的收获方面，据统计，六千个法国殖民者就取得了阿尔及利亚全部农业产品的二分之一。
    阿尔及利亚的农业具有典型的殖民地性，农业生产几乎完全为法国垄断资本的经济利益服务。法国地主不让阿尔及利亚农民大量生产他们所需要的粮食，却广为种植葡萄来酿酒，以便对外输出。如今，葡萄生产占阿尔及利亚农业总产值的三分之一。其它水果、蔬菜之类产品的90％，也为法国人所有。
    由于法国殖民者长期残酷的压榨，阿尔及利亚人民的生活日益贫困。一个阿尔及利亚的农民每年收获的谷物还不到二百公斤。阿尔及利亚有一百五十万到二百万失业和半失业者，经常有将近三百万人挨饿。
    在贸易上，阿尔及利亚70％以上的贸易是同法国进行的。法国垄断资本以低价收购大量的矿产和农业原料，以高价输入工业制成品。1955年法国向阿尔及利亚输出总值二千亿法郎；阿尔及利亚向法国输出总值一千三百零五亿法郎。
    其他方面，如关税、银行、商业、交通运输业等，也大都为法国控制，它从中获取着巨大的利润。　（西）
