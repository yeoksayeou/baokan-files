The relevant personnel of the Ministry of Forestry Industry said that the Yichun, Harbin, Jilin, Inner Mongolia, Sichuan and other state-owned forest areas (including the Greater Khingan Mountains, Lesser Khingan Mountains, Changbai Mountains and southern forest areas) forest industry bureaus, Northeast Lumber Industry Bureau and others have developed plans to increase production and practice economy; forest industry units in southern forest areas such as Fujian, Hunan and Guangdong have also formulated various measures to increase production and practice economy. In completing this year's timber production tasks, these units will strive to increase timber production by another one million cubic meters and save 20 million yuan for the country through various measures to increase production and practice economy.

By the end of March, all national forest industrial enterprises had taken various measures to carry out the movement to increase timber production and practice economy, and had achieved preliminary results. The Yichun forest area carried out pilot work on saving timber in the Wumin River Forest Industry Bureau. Experiments have proved that the average timber yield per hectare of forest land has increased from 158 cubic meters in the past to about 168 cubic meters, an increase of 10 cubic meters of timber per hectare of forest land, and the timber yield rate has increased by more than 5%. These increased small-diameter timbers can be used for pit props and papermaking. If calculated based on a logging area of 100,000 hectares in state-owned forest areas, it can increase timber production by one million cubic meters.

In terms of expanding the scope of timber utilization, forest areas across the country plan to increase production of nearly 200,000 cubic meters of second-class pit props and third-class papermaking materials. Many forest areas have begun to use tree crowns and branches as fuel for heating. According to a survey, the Yichun forest area has as much as 350,000 cubic meters of firewood, wind-fallen wood, and standing dead trees for heating throughout the year, and these timbers have 10%-30% utilization value. However, a large number of tree crowns and branches in the forest area that can be used as firewood are simply thrown away. In the Friendship Forest Industry Bureau, all family members in the logging yards use branches as fuel for heating and cooking, saving more than 3,500 cubic meters of substandard materials in just one month after the implementation.

In addition to supplying the veneer suitable for papermaking to the papermaking sector, the Northeast Lumber Industry System proposed to increase the timber yield rate of logs by more than 1%, eliminate large veneer, and process all waste materials and veneer less than 50 cm in length into various small-sized timbers such as box boards, small squares, and ash strips, which can produce more than 30,000 cubic meters of finished timber for the country throughout the year. And comprehensively promote the experience of rational sawing, which can produce 7,000 cubic meters of finished timber throughout the year.

All forest industrial enterprises have also arranged this year's plans in accordance with the spirit of running enterprises diligently and thriftily. Unnecessary investment projects have been cut, institutions and personnel have been streamlined, administrative expenses have been reduced, and cost plans have been lowered, which will save a lot of funds for the country. The Jilin Forest Industry Bureau cut the office building planned to be built for 320,000 yuan, and the total amount of projects and equipment purchased reduced by the bureau reached more than 2.4 million yuan. The Inner Mongolia Forest Industry Bureau proposed to reduce the cost of timber by one yuan per cubic meter and other measures, saving more than 3 million yuan for the country throughout the year. The Sichuan Minjiang Water Transport Office proposed to improve business management and change the method of rafting, so that the cost of timber per cubic meter would be reduced by 5%-7%.

    森林工业部门想了许多办法
    今年将增产木材一百万立方公尺
    本报讯　据森林工业部的有关人员谈，全国各林区（包括大兴安岭、小兴安岭、长白山和南方等地国有林区）的伊春、哈尔滨、吉林、内蒙古、四川等森林工业管理局，东北制材工业管理局等已订出了增产节约计划；南方林区的福建、湖南、广东等森林工业单位也拟定了各种增产节约措施。这些单位在完成今年木材生产任务中，通过各种增产节约办法，争取为国家再增产木材一百万立方公尺，节约金额二千万元。
    到三月底为止，全国各森林工业企业均采取了各项措施，开展了增产节约木材运动，并初步获得了成绩。伊春林区在乌敏河森林工业局进行了节约木材试点工作，实验证明，使每公顷林地的木材产量，平均由过去的一百五十八立方公尺提高到一百六十八立方公尺左右，在一公顷的林地里即可增产十立方公尺木材，出材率提高了5％以上。这些增产的小径木材都可以供作坑木、造纸使用。如以国有林区采伐面积十万公顷计算，则可增产一百万立方公尺木材。
    在扩大木材利用范围方面，全国各林区计划增产近二十万立方公尺的二等坑木和三等造纸材。许多林区已开始用树冠和枝桠作取暖燃料。据调查伊春林区全年取暖用的薪炭材、风倒木、站杆达三十五万立方公尺之多，这些木材都有10％—30％的利用价值。而林区里大量可以供作烧材的树冠和枝桠都白白扔掉了。友好森林工业局各伐木场，家属一律用枝桠作取暖和煮饭燃料，仅在推行后的一个月里就节省了三千五百多立方公尺的等外材。
    东北制材工业系统除把适合用作造纸材的板皮供应造纸部门外，提出把原木出材率提高1％以上，消灭大板皮，凡长度五十公分以下的剩料和板皮，一律加工成箱板、小方、灰条等各种小规格木材，全年可为国家多生产出三万多立方公尺成材。并全面推广合理下锯的经验，全年可多出成材七千立方公尺。
    各森林工业企业也都根据勤俭办企业的精神安排了今年的各项计划。削减了不必要的投资项目，精简了机构人员，压缩了行政费用开支，降低了成本计划，将为国家节约大量的资金。吉林森林工业管理局将原计划用三十二万元修建的办公楼房削减掉，全局削减的工程和购置设备总额达二百四十多万元。内蒙古森林工业管理局提出每立方公尺木材成本降低一元和其他措施，全年为国家节约三百多万元。四川岷江水运处提出要改善经营管理，改变流送方法，使每立方公尺木材成本降低5％—7％。
