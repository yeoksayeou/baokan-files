There are ways to overcome difficulties with insufficient funds
Wang Shusheng, Deputy Director of Xinle Agricultural Cooperative

Just when the cooperative needed a large amount of funds for production, the source of funds became difficult. Every morning, the accounting office was like a small teahouse, with people coming and going, mostly to ask for money. Some were production team leaders coming to collect money for repairing farm tools and buying fertilizer; some were households in difficulty asking for advance payments; and some were people from outside the cooperative coming to collect debts. The accountant simply couldn't cope!

Why was it so difficult? First of all, because last year's expenditure was too large. In the first half of last year, the cooperative carried out too much capital construction. Buying double-wheeled double-share plows, double-wheeled single-share plows, water pumps, buying large boats, building cattle sheds, duck sheds, etc., alone cost more than 34,300 yuan, and we still owe the National Bank more than 9,000 yuan in loans. Last year's plan for planting double-cropping rice was too high, wasting more than 11,000 jin of rice seeds, worth about 1,000 yuan. Blindly planting potatoes (the local soil is not suitable for potatoes) also resulted in a loss of more than 1,600 yuan. There are many similar things.

Production costs are very high, and it is necessary to take care of the members' increased income, so the cooperative has even less working capital left. Despite this, an unpleasant thing happened in the distribution: when announcing the settlement results, the members were told that each labor day was worth 1.19 yuan; but then it was discovered that the value of some non-distributable fixed assets should not have been included in the amount distributed to the members, so it was necessary to reduce the remuneration for each labor day to 1.06 yuan. Even so, there was still not enough cash, so we had to owe the members 900 yuan (later 500 yuan was repaid). This made some members very dissatisfied. Later, after much explanation, everyone's emotions stabilized.

We originally pinned our hopes for solving the funding problem on income from sideline occupations; however, we also encountered difficulties in this regard. More than 1,300 ducks raised by the cooperative contracted an infectious disease, and more than 800 have died since January. The woven straw bags and bamboo baskets, which originally sold well, have recently accumulated a backlog.

According to preliminary calculations, the entire cooperative needs approximately 6,000 yuan in funds during the spring plowing season. Can this difficulty be overcome? What methods can be used to overcome it? At first, everyone was unsure. Later, we discovered that there was still a lot of potential within the cooperative, and we mobilized the members to come up with many ways to save money. For example: the boat sheds, boat ropes, and manure bucket ropes that were planned to be bought will not be bought now, and the members will use hemp and glutinous rice straw to twist them; the connecting head plates and other parts on the waterwheels will also be made by the members themselves; accumulate more natural fertilizer and buy less commercial fertilizer. Adding in other aspects, approximately 529 yuan in funds can be saved.

On the production side, we can also strive to increase some income. Planting more than 30 mu of mustard greens and cabbage well can quickly generate more than 1,000 yuan in income. Buying feed requires a lot of money. If we use some wasteland ponds and dry land to grow more melons and vegetables, we can obtain a large amount of feed. The entire cooperative has more than 200 mu of rape, and currently selling rape hearts that are picked can also generate several hundred yuan in income.

In terms of sideline production, we are educating members to improve product quality and actively look for sales channels. According to our understanding, the backlog of sideline products is a temporary phenomenon and may be sold in April. Therefore, the funding problems needed by our cooperative during the spring plowing season can almost all be resolved. Of course, the current funding difficulties must be actively addressed. Currently, the cooperative leadership is calling on members to invest. According to our understanding, the members have some surplus money in their hands, but they have some concerns because of the reduction in labor day remuneration that occurred during the year-end distribution last year. This requires us to go deep into the masses and do more ideological work.

    有办法克服资金不足的困难
    新乐农业社副主任  王树生
    正当社里生产急需大量款项的时候，资金来源却发生了困难。每天早晨，会计室里像小茶馆似的，人们进进出出，多是来要钱的。有的是生产队长来领修理农具和购买肥料的费用；有的是困难户来要求预支；也有的是社外的人来讨欠款。会计简直没法应付！
    为什么会这样困难呢？首先是因为去年开支过大。去年上半年，合作社过多地进行了基本建设，光是购买双轮双铧犁、双轮单铧犁、抽水机、买大船、造牛棚、鸭棚等项，就用了三万四千三百多元，现在还欠国家银行的贷款九千多元；去年种双季稻计划偏高，糟蹋了一万一千多斤稻种，约值一千元；盲目种植马铃薯（本地土质不适合种马铃薯），又亏本一千六百多元。类似这样事情还有不少。
    生产成本很高，又必需照顾社员增加收入，合作社留下的流动资金就更少了。尽管这样，在分配上还发生了一件不愉快的事情：在宣布决算结果的时候告诉社员说，每个劳动日报酬是一元一角九分；可是随后又发现不该把一部分不能分配的固定财产的价值计算到社员分配的数目里，于是不得不把每个劳动日的报酬降低到一元零六分。就是这样，现款还是不够，只好欠下社员九百元钱（后来还了五百元）。这一下子，有些社员可就大不满意了。后来经过许多解释，大家的情绪才算稳定下来。
    我们原来把解决资金问题的希望寄托在副业收入上；可是，这方面也遇到困难。社里养的一千三百多只鸭子得了传染病，从1月以来，死了八百多只。编织的草包、竹篮，原来销路很好，最近积压了一部分。
    根据初步计算，全社在春耕期间大约需要六千多元资金。这个困难究竟能不能克服？用什么办法去克服？最初大家心里都没有底。后来，我们发现社内还有不少的潜力，便发动社员想出了许多节约资金的办法。例如：计划买的船棚、船绳和粪桶索，现在不买了，由社员们利用麻皮、糯稻柴来绞；水车上的连头板子等等零件，也由社员自己制做；多积自然肥料，少买商品肥料。加上其他方面，大约可节省资金五百二十九元。
    在生产方面也可以争取增加一部分收入。计划把三十多亩芥菜和小白菜种好，很快就可以得到一千多元的收入。购买饲料需要很多钱，如果利用一部分荒塘和旱地多种些瓜菜，就可以得到大量饲料。全社有二百多亩油菜，目前摘油菜心卖，也可以收入几百元。
    在副业生产方面，我们正在教育社员提高产品质量，并且积极找销路。根据我们了解的情况，副业产品积压是暂时现象，4月间就可能卖出去。因此，我们社春耕期间所需要的资金问题差不多都是可以解决的。当然，眼前的资金困难，必须积极设法克服。现在，合作社领导上正在号召社员投资。据我们了解，社员手里是有一部分余钱的，但是因为去年年终分配的时候发生了那件减少劳动日报酬的事情，社员们有些顾虑。这就需要我们深入群众，多做思想工作了。
