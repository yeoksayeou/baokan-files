    The Will and Emotions of Heroes
    Wan Song
    Sholokhov's new work, "The Fate of a Man," writes about an ordinary Soviet man, Sokolov, who joined the Red Army during the Civil War, worked as a laborer for wealthy peasants in the famine of 1922, and whose parents and sister all starved to death. Later, he married a wife who was "smart and gentle" because she "knew the hardships of life from an early age," and they had a son and two daughters. He learned to drive a car and lived a happy life. However, when the Great Patriotic War broke out, he went to the front; in less than a year, he became a prisoner of the German invaders. In the concentration camp, he suffered all kinds of torture, but with his comrades who were "prisoners," he still carried out his great work in the dark, executing traitors, fighting the enemy with unyielding resistance, and upholding "Russian dignity and pride." Later, he got an opportunity and captured a fascist major and returned to his unit. But he successively received news that his wife and daughters had been killed by enemy planes, and his son, who had joined the army, had also been killed by the enemy, leaving him all alone. After demobilization, he continued to work as a driver. One day, he pretended that a child who had also been orphaned by the war was his own son, and from then on, the two lived together, depending on each other; he loved the child with all his heart, and he wanted to cultivate the child into a "person with an indomitable will... when he grows up, he will definitely be able to endure everything and overcome all the difficulties on his path, as long as his motherland calls him to do so."
    This is one of the ordinary Soviet people, and also one of the countless heroes of the Soviet Union. This is common in Soviet literature. However, in the entire novel, Sholokhov emphatically reflects the protagonist's extreme grief and distress, depicting his "lifeless, exhausted eyes," his "waking up at night... always soaking the entire pillow" with "tears"... Therefore, some friends say that the author has written the character's mood too darkly, seemingly damaging the image of the hero.
    I don't think the writing of this novel is perfect, but I feel that he wrote this hero very realistically. He wrote about a real person, and therefore also wrote about a real hero. A hero is a person, he cannot be without emotions, without grief and distress. Since he has to endure the major misfortunes he has encountered for the sake of the destiny of the motherland, his grief and distress are exceptionally deep. He even complains about life: "Life, why are you teasing me like this? Why are you punishing me like this!" But what he resents is not the motherland, not socialist society, but the enemy. The problem lies only in the fact that "as long as his motherland calls him to do so," he "will definitely be able to endure everything and overcome all the difficulties on his path." He can control himself with a strong will: first, not to show grief in front of the enemy - only to show dignity and pride to the enemy; second, not to shed tears in front of the young - in order to "not hurt the child's heart"; third, not to sigh during daytime work - "only to cry in dreams"... Sholokhov even said: "No, those elderly men who turned gray in the war years do not only cry in their dreams, they also cry when they are awake. The main thing here is to be good at turning your face away in time." The will that is tempered from grief and distress and can control grief and distress, this is the hero's noble will!
    Now some people think that heroes should only have will and should not have emotions. For example, some works write about a revolutionary who wholeheartedly serves the people, but because he is busy with work, he does not have time to care for and help his wife, making her feel depressed, but he can feel no guilt towards his wife for a long time, and even blames his wife's depression as petty-bourgeois sentiment. Such a revolutionary, compared to Sokolov, who pushed his crying wife who was seeing him off to the front and later never forgave himself, seems to be even more of a hero, but I think he is inhuman.
    I once did an experiment. During the Liberation War, our struggle was extremely arduous and the situation was very difficult. At that time, some young female comrades, whose performance was usually very good, but "every festive season doubles the longing for relatives," for example, during the New Year, they would start to cry when they thought of their parents and husbands whom they could not meet. So I found them and said: "It's rare for you to cry once, now that you miss your relatives, you should cry, cry to your heart's content. However, secretly hide in a corner to cry, don't do it in front of people. One is that it will affect other people's emotions, and the other is that people will say that your family concept is too deep." As a result, they stopped crying, it is said because someone understood their hearts and felt the warmth of the revolutionary ranks.
    The Russian Chernyshevsky once said: "In art, a noble virtuous person should be portrayed as having the diverse aspirations that a lively person often has: if the protagonist in the play only has one emotion, and sees, hears, and feels nothing but the commands of his virtuous aspirations, then he is a stiff, withered skeleton, not a living person. However, a person with noble virtue can overcome all the diverse aspirations that attract him, and make them obey his main aspiration; yes, for this, he must often fight with himself. However, the more intense the struggle, the more beautiful and powerful his virtuous aspirations appear." ("Anthology of Dramatic Theory" 1957, Issue 1, page 48.)
    I think that these words are both in line with life and with aesthetics, and are sufficient to explain the characteristics of Sholokhov's novel.

    英雄的意志和感情
    万松
    萧洛霍夫的新作“一个人的遭遇”，写的是一个普通的苏联人索柯洛夫，内战时期参加过红军，在饥馑的1922年给富农做过苦工，父母和妹妹都饿死了，后来结了婚，有一个“从小就知道生活的艰辛”因而聪明、温柔的妻子，而且有了一个儿子和两个女儿。他学会了开汽车的本事，过着幸福的生活。然而卫国战争爆发了，他上了前线；不到一年，却作了德寇的俘虏。在集中营里，他受尽了折磨，但是与“虽则当了俘虏”的同志们，在黑暗中，仍然从事自己伟大的工作，处决了叛徒，对敌人进行了宁死不屈的斗争，坚持了“俄罗斯人的尊严和骄傲”。后来，他得了一个机会，俘虏了一个法西斯的少校归队了。但是陆续得到消息，妻女被敌机炸死了，参军的儿子也被敌人打死了，成了孤零零的一人。复员以后，他仍然当司机。有一天，他冒认了一个同样因战争而成了孤儿的孩子为亲生儿子，从此两个人相依为命地活下去；他全心爱这孩子，而且他要把这孩子培养成一个“有着不屈不挠的意志的人……长大成人以后，一定能够忍受一切，克服自己道路上的一切困难，只要他的祖国号召他去这样做。”
    这是普通的苏维埃人的一个，也是苏联无数英雄中的一个。这在苏联的文艺作品中，是常见的。但是萧洛霍夫在全篇小说中，却强调地反映主人翁的极度的悲痛和苦闷的一面，描写他的“没有生气，疲惫不堪的眼睛”，他的“晚上醒来时……总是湿透了整个枕头”的“泪水”……。因此，有的朋友说，作者把这人物的心情写得太阴暗了，似乎损害了英雄的形象。
    我并不以为这篇小说的写法十全十美，却觉得他写这个英雄写得很真实。他写出了一个真正的人，因而也写出了一个真正的英雄。英雄是人，他不会没有感情，不会没有悲痛和苦闷。既然为了祖国的命运不能不忍受个人所遭遇的重大不幸，他的悲痛和苦闷，也就异常之深。他甚至于抱怨生活：“生活啊，你为什么这样作弄我？为什么这样惩罚我啊！”但是他所怨的不是祖国，不是社会主义社会，而是敌人。问题只在于“只要他的祖国号召他去这样做”的时候，他“一定能够忍受一切，克服自己道路上的一切困难”。他能以坚强的意志去控制自己：一不在敌人面前流露悲痛，——对敌人只给看尊严和骄傲；二不在幼小者的面前流泪——为了“不要伤害小孩的心灵”；三不在白天工作的时候，唉声叹气——“只在梦中才哭泣”……。萧洛霍夫甚至于说：“不，那些上了年纪的、在战争的年代里白了头发的男人不仅只在梦中才哭泣，他们在清醒的时候也会哭泣的。这儿主要的，是善于及时地转过脸来。”从悲痛和苦闷中锻炼出来的而且能够控制悲痛和苦闷的意志，这才是英雄的崇高的意志呵！
    现在有些人，以为英雄是只应该具有意志，而不应该具有感情的。例如，有的作品写一个全心全意为人民服务的革命者，因为工作忙，没有关怀和帮助妻子的时间，使得她感到苦闷，但他可以在长时期内对妻子毫不负疚，而且责备妻子的苦闷是小资产阶级情绪。这样的革命者，比起那因为在上前线的时候，对送别的哭得伤心的妻子推了一下而后来总不饶恕自己的索柯洛夫来，似乎更是英雄了，但我认为他不近人情。
    我曾经作过一个试验。在解放战争的时候，我们的斗争曾经极艰苦，处境十分困难。那时有些青年女同志，平日的表现是很好的，但“每逢佳节倍思亲”，例如，过年的时候，想起不能见面的父母和丈夫，就要哭起来了。我于是找了她们来说：“你们难得哭一回，现在想起亲人，是该哭的，哭就哭个痛快罢。不过，偷偷地躲到角落上去哭，不要当着人。一则会影响别人的情绪，二则，别人会说你们家庭观念太深。”这一来，她们倒不哭了，据说是因为有人体贴她们的心，感到了革命队伍的温暖。
    俄国的车尔尼雪夫斯基曾经说过：“崇高的善人在艺术上应该表现得具有生气勃勃的人所常有的多样憧憬：如果剧中主角只具有一种感情，除了听从他的德性憧憬的命令以外，他别无所见，别无所闻，别无所感，那么，他便是僵死的、枯槁的骷髅，而不是一个生人了。然而，一个具有崇高德性的人，能够把吸引他的一切多样的憧憬克服了，使之服从他的主要憧憬；不错，为了这，他必须常常同自己斗争。然而，斗争越剧烈，他的德性憧憬底强大和崇高便显得越美好、越有力。”（“戏剧论丛”1957年第一辑四八页。）
    我以为，这话，既合乎生活，也就合乎美学，足以解释萧洛霍夫的这篇小说的特点。
