Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 24th: TASS reports that the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, wrote a letter to the British Prime Minister, Macmillan, suggesting that all relevant countries immediately take measures that can be agreed upon now in order to ease the current tension in the Near and Middle East.

The letter was delivered to the British Prime Minister on April 20th by the Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Malik.

In the letter, Bulganin wrote that the current tension in the Near and Middle East is primarily caused by the unwillingness of certain groups in Britain and other countries to consider the legitimate interests and rights of the Arab Eastern countries that have embarked on the road of national independence and rejuvenation. We believe that the task of maintaining lasting peace in the Near and Middle East requires major powers to strictly adhere to the principle of resolving all disputes related to this region and involving them peacefully, to respect the sovereignty and independence of the Near and Middle Eastern countries, and to not allow interference in the internal affairs of these countries.

Bulganin expressed regret that the British government believed it impossible to support the Soviet government's earlier proposal for the four major powers (Soviet Union, United States, Britain, and France) to jointly declare the above principles.

Bulganin told Macmillan that the situation in the Near and Middle East, which directly borders the Soviet Union, cannot but affect the security of the Soviet Union. In view of the complexity of the existing problems, steps should be taken immediately that can achieve agreement to achieve the health and normalization of the situation in the Near and Middle East. We believe that if major powers could come forward to condemn the use of force as a means of resolving outstanding issues in the Near and Middle East, they would make a great contribution to the normalization of the situation in the Near and Middle East.

In the letter, Bulganin also discussed issues such as disarmament and European security. He said that the current situation requires that everyone's views be brought closer together, first and foremost, on the most urgent and pressing disarmament issues. There are now objective prerequisites for countries to reach agreement in this regard.

Bulganin reiterated the Soviet proposals submitted to the United Nations Disarmament Commission Subcommittee, in particular the proposal to conclude an international convention on the reduction of armaments and troops and the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons. He said that the Soviet government believes that the major powers can now demonstrate their sincerity in resolving these issues with facts, first by agreeing to immediately ban atomic and hydrogen weapon tests, and to resolve this issue separately from the entire disarmament issue, without linking it to reaching agreement on other aspects of disarmament.

Regarding the issue of ensuring European security, Bulganin wrote that since it is difficult to eliminate national military blocs all at once and to replace these blocs with a European collective security system, efforts should be made, for the sake of the security of Britain, the Soviet Union, and the entire Europe, to strive to reach agreement on temporary transitional measures that would help gradually achieve this goal. On this issue, the Soviet government is prepared to resume discussions on the proposals made by the former British Prime Minister Sir Anthony Eden regarding the establishment of demilitarized zones and zones of limited armaments in Europe. The Soviet government believes that the relevant proposals of the Soviet government should also be considered at the same time, especially the proposal for European aerial photography zones.

In order to safeguard peace in Europe and the world, and to change the current tension in Soviet-British relations, Bulganin finally suggested in the letter that the Soviet and British sides consult in the near future to take joint measures to ensure a substantial expansion of cultural, scientific, and technological exchanges between the two countries.

    布尔加宁致函麦克米伦
    呼吁采取措施缓和中东局势
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科24日讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁写信给英国首相麦克米伦，建议各有关国家立即采取现在就可以达成协议的措施，以便缓和目前中近东的紧张局势。
    这封信已经由苏联驻英国大使马立克在4月20日交给英国首相。
    布尔加宁在信中写道，目前中近东的紧张局势首先是由于英国和其他一些国家的某些集团不愿意考虑已经走上民族独立和复兴道路的阿拉伯东方各国的合理利益和权利而引起的。我们认为，维护中近东持久和平的任务要求各大国严格地遵循以和平方式解决一切涉及这个地区的、同它们有关的争执问题的原则，尊重中近东国家的主权和独立，不容许干涉这些国家的内政。
    布尔加宁对英国政府认为不可能支持苏联政府早先提出的关于由四大国（苏、美、英、法）共同宣布上述原则的建议这一点表示遗憾。
    布尔加宁对麦克米伦说，直接与苏联国境毗连的中近东的局势，不能不关系到苏联的安全。鉴于现有问题的复杂性，应该立刻采取现在就可以取得协议的步骤来达到中近东局势的健康化和正常化。我们认为，如果大国能够出面指责以武力作为解决中近东地区未决问题的手段，那么它们对中近东局势的正常化将会有巨大贡献。
    布尔加宁在信中还谈到了裁军和欧洲安全等问题。他说，目前的局势要求，首先必须在最紧急的、最迫切的裁军问题上使大家的看法接近起来。现在有着各国在这方面达成协议的客观前提。
    布尔加宁重申了提交联合国裁军委员会小组委员会审议的苏联建议，特别是关于缔结裁减军备和军队以及禁止原子武器和氢武器的国际公约的建议。他说，苏联政府认为，各大国现在已经可以用事实来表明自己对解决这些问题的诚意，首先同意立即禁止原子武器和氢武器试验，而且把这个问题同整个裁军问题分开来单独解决，不把它同裁军问题其他方面达成协议一事牵连在一起。
    关于保证欧洲安全的问题，布尔加宁写道，由于很难一下子消除各国军事集团和以欧洲集体安全体系来代替这些集团，因此，应当为了英国、苏联以及整个欧洲安全的利益，努力争取在有助于逐步实现这一目的的临时过渡性措施上达成协议。在这个问题上，苏联政府准备恢复讨论英国前首相艾登爵士提出的关于在欧洲建立非军事区以及限制军备区的建议。苏联政府认为，同时还要审议苏联政府的有关建议，特别是关于欧洲空中摄影区的建议。
    为了维护欧洲和全世界的和平以及改变目前苏英关系中的某种紧张局面，布尔加宁最后在信中建议，苏英双方在最近协商采取共同的措施，以保证大大扩大两国的文化和科学技术交流。
