Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 2nd - The Second National Congress of Soviet Composers has entered its sixth day. In addition to listening to the summary report on the work of the board of the Soviet Composers Association, the attendees also listened to a supplementary report by Soviet music theorist Yarustovsky on Soviet composers writing incidental music for dramas, and a supplementary report by "Soviet Music" magazine editor Khubov on music criticism. Subsequently, the congress launched discussions on these reports. At the meeting on March 31, He Luting, the Chinese composer invited to participate in the congress, delivered a congratulatory letter on behalf of the Chinese composers and gave a speech.

In his report, Yarustovsky discussed how to embody current themes in operas and how to combat the false theory of no-conflict and formulaic approaches in creation.

In his report, Khubov pointed out that it is necessary to study the complex process of modern art development in the last seventy-five years more deeply and objectively. He said that it is necessary to have the ability to distinguish between the progressive and reactionary aspects. He opposed treating art with a simple, crude, and one-sided attitude. He sharply criticized the newly emerged "twelve-tone music" system in the world and various kinds of empty, tedious, and "electronic music" works. He said that these works are incompatible with truly humanistic art, utopian, and lifeless, and this music will not resonate with the vast number of music lovers.

In his report, Khubov also mentioned the power of progressive art and the need to get closer to composers from all over the world. This call to expand international connections and exchange creative experiences received the most enthusiastic response from representatives and guests.

In his speech during the discussion, Moscow composer Vlasov talked about the interrelationship between Soviet composers and performers. He said that there are many vivid examples of cooperation between composers and performers. However, they still have not achieved regular contact. In this way, the dissemination of Soviet music is primarily harmed. At present, this dissemination is often formal. There is a need for song and dance troupes that truly love Soviet music and are good at spreading it.

Ukrainian composer Kos-Anatolsky said in his speech that it is important not only to condemn dogmatism, but also to fight against its various manifestations. This will help create works that truly conform to the principles of socialist realism. We must respect the progressive national traditions in art. National forms of music help cultivate the spirit of Soviet patriotism.

In addition, representatives from Belarus, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan have also spoken at the congress. They talked about the achievements of Soviet national music and the rapid growth of young musicians. They also put forward requirements to the association to improve leadership and strengthen ties with the music circles in various places. Some representatives also raised different opinions on some of the arguments in Khubov's report, such as the definition of modernism.

Chinese composer He Luting said in his speech that the Chinese revolution has received tremendous help from the Soviet Union, both ideologically and materially. The same is true in the field of music. Since China's liberation, musicians from the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries have continuously visited China, playing a significant role in enriching China's musical life. He said that China has a long history and its musical cultural treasures are extremely rich, but Chinese society has long been under feudal rule, and the development of modern music culture in China has been very late. Therefore, from the perspective of the field of music culture, China is an ancient country, but also a young country. Last year, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party advocated letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend in order to prosper and develop socialist national culture. Although this policy has been put forward not long ago, the situation has already changed, and more active phenomena are emerging in creation, performance, and scientific research than before.

### 苏联作曲家讨论创作道路  提出繁荣苏维埃音乐的意见

    苏联作曲家讨论创作道路
    提出繁荣苏维埃音乐的意见
    新华社莫斯科2日电　苏联作曲家第二次全国代表大会已经进入第六天。出席大会的人除听取了关于苏联作曲家协会理事会工作的总结报告外，还连续听取了苏联音乐理论家亚鲁斯托夫斯基所作的关于苏联作曲家为戏剧谱制插曲的补充报告，和“苏维埃音乐”杂志编辑胡鲍夫关于音乐批评的补充报告。接着，大会就这些报告展开了讨论。在3月31日的大会上，应邀参加大会的中国作曲家贺绿汀代表中国作曲家们宣读了贺信并且讲了话。
    亚鲁斯托夫斯基在报告中谈到了如何在歌剧中体现当前的各种题材，如何同无冲突论的虚伪理论和创作中的公式化进行斗争等问题。
    胡鲍夫在报告中指出，必须更加深入而客观地研究最近七十五年现代艺术发展的复杂过程。他说，必须有鉴别其中进步一面和反动一面的能力。反对用简单、粗糙而片面的态度来对待艺术。他尖锐地批评了世界上新近出现的“十二音音乐”体系，批评各种各样空洞烦琐和“电子音乐”的作品。他说，这些作品是同真正的人道主义的艺术格格不相入的，空想的、没有生气的，这些音乐不会在广大的音乐爱好者中间得到响应。
    胡鲍夫在报告中还说到进步艺术的力量，必须和世界各国的作曲家多多接近。这个扩大国际联系，相互交流创作经验的号召在代表和来宾中得到了最热烈的响应。
    在代表们的讨论发言中，莫斯科作曲家符拉索夫谈到了苏联作曲家和演奏者的互相关系问题。他说，作曲家和演奏者之间有许多生动的合作范例。但是，他们之间仍然还没有取得经常的联系。这样，受到损害的首先是苏维埃音乐的传播工作。目前这种传播往往是形式的。需要有真正爱好苏维埃音乐和善于传播这种音乐的歌舞团体。
    乌克兰作曲家科斯—安纳托尔斯基在发言中说，重要的不仅在于谴责教条主义，而且还必须跟它的各种表现作斗争。这样将有助于创作出真正符合社会主义现实主义原则的作品。必须尊重艺术中进步的民族传统。民族形式的音乐有助于培养苏维埃爱国主义精神。
    此外，白俄罗斯、乌兹别克和哈萨克等共和国的代表也已经在大会上发了言。他们谈到了苏联民族音乐的成就和青年音乐家的迅速成长。他们还对协会提出了改善领导和加强与各地音乐界联系的要求。一些代表在发言中还对胡鲍夫报告中的一些论点，例如对现代主义所下的定义，提出了不同的意见。
    中国作曲家贺绿汀在讲话中说，中国革命不论在思想上、在物质上都得到苏联巨大的帮助。在音乐领域内也不能例外。中国解放以后，苏联和人民民主国家的音乐家们不断访问中国，对丰富中国音乐生活方面，起了很大的作用。他说，中国历史悠久，音乐文化宝藏是极其丰富的，但是中国社会曾经长期处在封建统治之下，现代音乐文化在中国的发展为时很晚。因此从音乐文化领域来看，中国是一个古老的国家，同时也是一个年青的国家。去年，中国共产党中央为了繁荣与发展社会主义的民族文化，提倡百花齐放与百家争鸣。这个方针虽然提出来不久，但是情况已经有所变化，无论在创作、演出以及科学研究各方面都呈现出比较以前更加活跃的现象。（附图片）
