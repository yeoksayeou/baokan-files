Agricultural Proverbs (Continued Nine)
        Collected by Su Keqin
    V. Matters needing attention during harvesting and storage: "Seize the autumn to grab the wheat." "Seven-tenths ripe, eight-tenths yield." "Cotton should be picked well, not scattered all over the ground" (If cotton is scattered all over the ground when picking, not only is it not picked well, but it is also easy to damage cotton branches, leaves, and bolls). "Cool the beans before loading, warm the wheat" (This refers to threshing; beans should be cooled before being loaded. Wheat can be loaded while still warm, which makes it less prone to insects).
    VI. Concerning sideline occupations
    Concerning tree planting: "If there's space by the wall, there's space for trees." "Plant trees, not flowers; plant beans, not melons." "Seventh nine, eighth nine, plant flowers and raise willows" (raising willows means planting willows). "When the wheat is on the threshing floor, walnuts are half-filled." "In July, the edges turn red, and the dates have red circles." "July 15th, red circles; August 15th, falling poles" (refers to the growth and harvesting period of dates). "July dates, August pears, September persimmons with yellow bellies" (refers to the ripening time of dates, pears, and persimmons). "Peaches in three years, apricots in four, pears in five, dates pay back in the same year" (refers to the time it takes for peach trees, apricot trees, and date trees to bear fruit after planting). "Poplars aren't considered alive for three years, dates aren't considered dead for three years" (refers to the growth pattern of poplar trees and date trees after planting). "Dry years for dates, wet years for pears" (refers to dates growing well in dry years and pears growing well in wet years).
