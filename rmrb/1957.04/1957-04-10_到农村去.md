Going to the Countryside

What will middle school graduates do if they cannot continue their studies? This is a question that concerns many middle school students. After reading the editorial "On the Question of Middle and Primary School Graduates Participating in Agricultural Production," some graduating students from Beijing No. 17 Middle School held a discussion to talk about their feelings and gains.

In their speeches at the symposium, everyone expressed excitement. They had a correct understanding of the issues of further education and employment, dispelled their doubts and distress, and knew what correct attitude to take in dealing with this issue. They said that if they cannot continue their studies, they will go to the countryside to build a new socialist countryside.

In the recent period, many students have not had a clear understanding of the issues of further education and participation in labor production. Some students do not understand why many middle and primary school graduates cannot continue their studies this year, believing that national construction is getting better year by year, and the number of students who can continue their studies should also increase year by year. Participating in agricultural production is seen as embarrassing. Student Hou Fengyun said that she initially thought that farming was something that people without knowledge did, and it was not promising; it was "shameful" for people with knowledge to do it. After reading this editorial, she understood that it is normal for many middle and primary school graduates to not be able to continue their studies and have to participate in production, and she also realized that it was wrong to say that farming is "not promising" and "shameful." She said: "My father is a farmer, am I right to say that about him? I have now decided that if I don't get into school, I will go back to the countryside to farm." Student Xu Chonglin said: "My family is a middle peasant family. I used to know that the state's construction of heavy industry was important. When I graduated from elementary school, I wanted to enter a heavy industry technical school, not even a light industry school. Later, I was admitted to middle school. A few days ago, I was afraid that I would not be able to continue my studies, and that going back to the countryside would have no future. The more I thought about it, the more awkward I felt. Now my thinking has undergone a big change. I understand that one can learn until old age, and one can also learn after leaving school. I grew up in the countryside and know something about growing crops. I will be able to continuously improve myself by both working and learning."

An Gui Rong is an outstanding student in the class, with consistently good academic performance. However, she also made ideological preparations to go to the countryside. She said: "After reading the editorial, I have already made up my mind that if I don't get into high school, I will go home to participate in agricultural production."

Che Xirong has not participated in agricultural production labor, is not very strong, and is unwilling to do farm work, fearing that it would be very hard to be exposed to the sun in the fields. She originally planned to find work in a factory if she did not get into high school. At the symposium, Che Xirong said: "I now realize that my previous thinking was wrong. If our young generation does not farm, who will take over the work of the older generation? What will the people of the whole country eat? How can the country carry out industrial construction? My thought of being afraid of hardship is wrong. If I don't get into high school, I will have the courage to farm."

With the improvement of everyone's ideological understanding and a standard for distinguishing right from wrong, their ability to resist the pressure from various incorrect public opinions from their families and society has also been enhanced. Student Zhang Deyi said: "My mother told me to study, that is, to go from elementary school to junior high school, from junior high school to high school, and from high school to university. She doesn't want me to go back to my hometown to farm. Now that I have clarified the principles, I can persuade my mother." Li Shumin's neighbors and relatives all said that participating in agricultural production is "not promising." She did not dare to mention to them that she wanted to participate in agricultural production. Now she says, "I dare to explain my true feelings to them."

The symposium ended in a lively and pleasant atmosphere. Every student saw the bright future of participating in agricultural production. Everyone is preparing to meet the future life with a revolutionary optimistic spirit. Everyone's slogan is, "If we don't get into high school, we will happily go to the countryside and be the glorious first generation of educated farmers in China!"

    到农村去
    中学毕业生如果不能升学，将要做些什么？对于这个问题，广大中学生是很关心的。北京市第十七中学一些应届毕业生，看了“关于中小学毕业生参加农业生产问题”社论以后，开了一个座谈会，谈谈大家的感想和收获。
    大家在座谈会的发言中，始终流露出兴奋的心情。他们对升学和就业问题有了正确的认识，消除了疑虑和苦闷，知道应该以怎样的正确态度来处理这问题。他们说，如果不能升学，就到农村去，去建设社会主义的新农村。
    近一个时期以来，许多同学对升学和参加劳动生产问题的认识是不够清楚的。有的同学对于为什么今年有很多中小学毕业生不能升学的情况不了解，认为国家建设一年比一年好，能升学的学生也应该一年比一年多。参加农业生产是难为情的事。学生侯凤云说，他起初认为种地是没有知识人干的事，没出息；有知识的人干了“丢人”。她看了这篇社论以后，懂得了很多中小学毕业生不能升学，而要参加生产是正常的情况，也认识到过去说种地“没出息”，“丢人”是错误的。她说：“我父亲就是种地的，难道我这样说他是对的吗？我现在决定，考不上学校，就回到农村去种田”。学生徐崇林说：“我家是中农，我过去知道国家建设重工业重要，在小学毕业时，就想进重工业中等技术学校，连轻工业学校都不进，后来考上了中学。前些日子怕不能升学，回农村去没有前途，越想越别扭。现在我思想有了很大的转变。我了解到，一个人做到老学到老，出学校也同样可以学习。我生长在农村，对于种庄稼还懂得些，一面劳动，一面学习，一定能不断提高自己。”
    安桂荣是班里的优秀生，学业成绩一向很好。可是，她也作了到农村去的思想准备。她说：“我读了社论以后，主意已经打定了，考不上高中就回家参加农业生产。”
    车喜荣没参加过农业生产劳动，身体不甚强壮，也不愿去做农活，怕到田里挨太阳晒得很苦，原打算考不上高中到工厂去找工做。在座谈会上，车喜荣说：“我现在认识从前的想法是不对的，假如我们年轻一代都不去种田，有谁去接老一辈的班呢？全国人民还吃什么呢？国家怎么能进行工业建设呢？我这种怕吃苦的思想是不对的。我如果考不上高中，就有勇气去种田。
    大家的思想认识提高了，有了明辨是非的标准，对于家庭和社会上各种不正确的舆论所施加压力的威胁，也增强了抵抗能力。学生张德义说：“我的母亲叫我读书，就是叫我由小学升初中，初中升高中，高中升大学。她不愿意我回乡种田。现在我把道理弄清楚了，就能去说服母亲了。”李淑敏的邻居和亲戚，都说参加农业生产“没出息”。她在他们面前不敢提自己要参加农业生产的事，现在她说，“我就敢向他们说明我的真心话了。”
    座谈会在活泼愉快的气氛中结束了。每个同学都看清了参加农业生产的光辉远景。大家都怀着革命的乐观主义精神，准备着去迎接未来的生活。大家的口号是，“考不上高中，我们就愉快地走到农村，做光荣的中国第一代有文化的农民！”
