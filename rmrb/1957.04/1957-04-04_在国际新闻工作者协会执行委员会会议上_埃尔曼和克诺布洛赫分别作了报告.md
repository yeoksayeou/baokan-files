Xinhua News Agency, 3rd dispatch: At the Beijing meeting of the International Organization of Journalists (IOJ) Executive Committee this morning, the IOJ President Jean Maurice Hermann delivered a report. He first pointed out that cooperation between the IOJ and UNESCO is necessary and beneficial.

He said: As everyone knows, our organization obtained consultative status immediately upon its establishment. Shortly after the split in our organization, its consultative status in the Economic and Social Council and UNESCO was revoked. At each of our meetings, we have repeatedly requested the restoration of our consultative status, but the response we have consistently received has been the same, consistently rejecting our request, postponing our request for future study without providing any legitimate reason to oppose our request.

He said that this situation is, in fact, an intolerable discrimination against the organization with the most journalists, and this discrimination hinders cooperation that could bring about greater effects.

Hermann said that the purpose of the IOJ is to provide fair and truthful news reporting to maintain peace, consolidate friendship among the people of all countries, oppose war propaganda, oppose racial hatred, and oppose spreading rumors and slander to create international tension. These principles do not prevent us from cooperating with UNESCO; on the contrary, our faithful attitude to ideals never conflicts with those principles put forward when UNESCO was established. Hermann said that our cooperation with UNESCO is necessary for both parties; we can use our activities to help UNESCO, that is to say, we take coordinated action to improve the quality and truthfulness of news reporting, and to consolidate peace through a better understanding of the people of all countries.

In his report, Hermann condemned various forms of censorship that hinder freedom of the press. He cited examples: In Algeria, all newspapers and democratic newspapers that express opposition are banned; in France, the police authorities can confiscate newspapers under the pretext of maintaining public order, so democratic newspapers are afraid of economic losses and dare not speak their true minds. Hermann emphasized that in Western countries, people say that the press is free, but to publish a newspaper requires a large amount of capital, and this freedom is not available to everyone; private enterprises that publish advertisements exert influence on newspapers, and there are also monopolistic forms of newspapers and radio systems. He said that this "economic censorship" is a prominent form of censorship.

Hermann said that the IOJ Congress had requested the United Nations to establish the principle of abolishing press censorship and to find ways to ensure that the press has freedom of speech without being manipulated by financial forces. However, so far, the United Nations specialized agencies have done nothing.

Hermann mentioned the resolution passed at the 1956 Helsinki International Meeting of Journalists, which believed that journalists should be allowed to travel freely without obstacles. Hermann said, however, that we often see cases of refusal to grant exit visas, such as the United States' attempt to revoke the passports of three journalists who had been to People's China. Hermann said that this is also an obstacle.

Hermann talked about the obstacles to faithful news reporting, and he condemned some newspapers' efforts to attract the public with false news. So-called sensational news is distorted reporting, and some news describes in detail all anti-social behavior cases. This practice lowers the level of newspapers and readers. Hermann condemned this decline of journalism.

Hermann said that the behavior of journalists must conform to the dignity necessary for the journalistic profession. The IOJ agreed to formulate an international code of honor for journalists, which should include: providing accurate and objective reports, opposing the creation of hatred and the incitement of war psychology, prohibiting plagiarism, etc.

Hermann said, I often hear American experts and reporters talking about newspapers as "news enterprises" and "news industries." I believe many of us think that news is not a business, nor is it an industry. Hermann said that everyone who has ever strived to lead a newspaper should keep in mind the words of Karl Marx: "The primary freedom of the press lies in not becoming an industry."

Hermann also talked about the training of journalists. He said that the best professional training for journalists is not purely technical training, but to create journalists who can truly live up to their name, and these journalists are also truly cultured people.

Hermann finally said that we journalists, scattered across continents, belonging to different races, different skin colors, different religious beliefs, and different opinions, are people who are gathered together and are close to each other. The reason for gathering together is because we are engaged in the same industry and we bear the same responsibility. If we hope to be proud of our profession, this requires that we be able to perform our duties honestly and efficiently everywhere to serve the public interest. Hundreds of millions of people can only get news from what we tell them. We are unwilling to deceive them, we are willing to help them better understand their own problems and their interests, we are unwilling to incite or spread hatred, we hope that the people of all countries will know each other better, understand each other better, and love each other better. We are unwilling to lower the public's thinking, we are willing to educate and improve their thinking. While making their minds happy, we are unwilling to make their minds decadent and degenerate. We are unwilling to work for war, we are willing to open the door to peace. Therefore, we are always looking for all opportunities to work together with all our comrades and colleagues in all countries of the world.

Xinhua News Agency, 3rd dispatch: At the IOJ Executive Committee meeting held this afternoon, the IOJ Secretary-General Jaroslav Knobloch said that the broad cooperation of journalists around the world was, is, and will continue to be the main task of the IOJ. We will do everything we can to promote broad cooperation and organizational unity among journalists of all countries.

After the afternoon meeting began, Knobloch first gave a report on the work of the IOJ.

Knobloch introduced the grand occasion of the International Meeting of Journalists held in Helsinki last June. He said that this meeting caused a great response, and the resolutions passed at the meeting were fully supported by the IOJ.

Knobloch talked about the recent development of cooperation among journalists of various countries. When he talked about the planned Asian-African Journalists Conference, he said that the initiative to hold a "Bandung Conference" of journalists, proposed by journalists from fourteen Asian and African countries who participated in the Helsinki meeting, will help strengthen the cooperation of journalists from "Bandung countries".

He pointed out that news about events in Asian countries often reaches other Asian countries through New York or London, and much of the news is incomplete or even distorted; cooperation between Asian and African journalists can help solve this problem, which is absurd today.

After talking about various aspects of international cooperation among journalists, Knobloch said that the IOJ has become a mouthpiece calling for unity and a pillar for all democratic journalists around the world to strive for friendly cooperation. Therefore, our organization has a great responsibility to continue to work hard to strive for the unity of journalists, strive to create convenient conditions for their work, and strive to implement the resolutions of the Helsinki meeting.

Knobloch reported in detail on the IOJ's activities in various aspects since the last Executive Committee meeting held last June, as well as various future work plans. He believes that the cooperation between the IOJ's member organizations is developing, and several countries have signed bilateral agreements; the cooperation between the scientific journalism societies in Eastern European countries has been smoothly launched. The IOJ is preparing to hold a number of international conferences for professional journalists in the near future to facilitate the improvement of journalists' professional standards and lay the foundation for cooperation and extensive exchange of experience and information.

Knobloch also mentioned that the International Journalists Cooperation Committee established after the Helsinki International Meeting of Journalists had suggested holding a meeting in Brussels between representatives of the Western International Federation of Journalists and representatives of the IOJ. Direct negotiations between representatives of the two organizations could help eliminate misunderstandings and pave the way for the establishment of a unified journalists' organization. The IOJ agreed to this suggestion and is willing to participate in such a meeting, but the responsible parties of the International Federation of Journalists did not respond to this initiative.

After Knobloch's report, the meeting began to discuss.

The Chairman of the German Democratic Republic Journalists Union, G. Klaus, spoke. He said that the journalists of the German Democratic Republic support the proposal of UNESCO to issue journalist cards. He emphasized that our country can only recognize such journalist cards on the basis of reciprocity between countries. The only way to achieve this reciprocity is to ensure that our country participates in UNESCO and enjoys equal rights with other countries.

The First Secretary of the German Democratic Republic Journalists Union, Hua Graul, spoke and introduced the close contact between the various news agencies of the German Democratic Republic and foreign news agencies. Graul also used concrete facts to illustrate that the suggestions put forward at the Helsinki International Meeting of Journalists to create convenient conditions for the activities of journalists have been largely implemented in the German Democratic Republic.

Graul pointed out that West German journalists can have all the working conditions for their activities in the German Democratic Republic; however, many journalists from the German Democratic Republic who travel to West Germany are not only hindered in their freedom of movement, but are even often illegally arrested, which is an absolute contempt for journalistic work.

The Vice-Chairman of the Bulgarian Journalists Association and Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the "Workers' Cause" newspaper, Vilev, spoke. He said that the activities of the IOJ are welcomed by Bulgarian journalists, who conscientiously implement and execute its resolutions.

Vilev said that in the second half of 1956, the Bulgarian Journalists Association sent 167 journalists abroad to visit, and also received 196 foreign journalists to visit Bulgaria. Even for those journalists who voluntarily proposed to visit Bulgaria, Bulgaria has never refused to grant them entry visas. But when Bulgarian journalists apply to visit certain Western countries, these countries put up iron curtains to block us. For example, the Bulgarian journalist who went to the United Nations General Assembly last year had to make great efforts to obtain a visa to enter the United States, but he could not step out of New York City, and even his activities within the city were restricted.

Victor Baradeanu, a member of the editorial board of the Romanian "Spark" newspaper, spoke. He said that Romanian journalists use various methods to report on the desire of our people to build their motherland and work for world peace, and many journalists have received national bonuses.

Baradeanu gave a detailed introduction to the various beneficial activities carried out by Romanian journalists and the extensive contacts they have established with journalists from various countries.

He accused some newspapers and radio stations in Britain, Italy, Austria and other countries of malicious propaganda against the Romanian Republic, and suggested that the meeting issue an appeal to UNESCO, urging journalists from all countries to abide by the principle of faithful news reporting.

He finally said that he hoped that the next meeting of the IOJ Executive Committee would be held in Bucharest.

Ochirlin Penchag, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the Mongolian "Truth" newspaper, spoke and said that in Mongolia, there is an average of one newspaper and one magazine for every three people, and the state attaches great importance to training journalistic cadres through universities and specialized training courses. Mongolian journalists support the work carried out by the IOJ among journalists to strengthen peace and friendship among the people of all countries.

The last speaker was Mexican journalist Gregoria Rosas Herrera. He said that in Mexico, some people are creating obstacles and undermining the cooperation and unity of international journalists. A Pan-American journalists organization is carrying out large-scale activities, and this organization has also received the support of the US embassies in various Latin American countries. He said that the situation of Mexican journalists is quite difficult, but Mexican journalists are firmly fighting for peace and independence. He finally expressed his sincere congratulations to the meeting on behalf of the Mexican branch of the IOJ and wished journalists all over the world unity and friendship.

At the meeting, a congratulatory letter to the meeting from Ryosuke Honda, secretary of the Japan Journalists Conference, who was unable to attend the meeting due to circumstances, was read.

Before the end of the afternoon meeting, the meeting adopted the list of members of the three committees that drafted the meeting documents. (Attached picture)

    在国际新闻工作者协会执行委员会会议上
    埃尔曼和克诺布洛赫分别作了报告
    据新华社3日讯　国际新闻工作者协会主席让·莫·埃尔曼，今天上午在国际新闻工作者协会执行委员会北京会议上作了报告。他首先指出，国际新闻工作者协会同联合国教育、科学及文化组织之间的合作是必要的和有益的。
    他说：大家知道，我们的组织一成立就获得了咨询地位。在我们的组织发生分裂后不久，它在经济及社会理事会和教育、科学及文化组织中的咨询地位便被取消了。我们在每次会议上都重新提出要求，要求恢复我们的咨询地位，可是我们所得到的回答始终一样，始终是拒绝我们的要求，就是把我们的要求推到以后去研究而又不提出任何正当理由来反对我们的要求。
    他说，这种情况事实上是一种对于拥有新闻记者最多的组织施行的难以容忍的歧视，这种歧视妨碍着可能带来更大效果的合作。
    埃尔曼说，国际新闻工作者协会的宗旨是提供公正真实的新闻报道来维护和平、巩固各国人民友谊，反对战争宣传，反对种族仇恨，反对造谣诽谤来制造国际紧张局势。这些原则不妨碍我们同联合国教育、科学及文化组织合作，恰恰相反，我们忠实于理想的态度是从来不同联合国教育、科学及文化组织建立时提出的那些原则冲突的。埃尔曼说，我们和联合国教育、科学及文化组织的合作，对双方都是必要的，我们可以用我们的活动来帮助联合国教育、科学及文化组织，这就是说我们采取协调行动来改进新闻报道的质量和真实性，来通过各国人民更好的了解以巩固和平。
    埃尔曼在报告中谴责了妨碍新闻自由的各种不同的检查。他举例说：在阿尔及利亚，一切表达反对意见的报刊和民主报刊都遭到取缔；在法国，警察当局可以借口维持公共秩序而没收报纸，因此民主报纸担心受到经济损失而不敢说真心话。埃尔曼强调指出，在西方国家，人们说新闻是自由的，但是，要出版一个报纸就要拥有大量资金，这种自由并不是人人都能享受的；刊登广告的私营企业对报纸施行着影响，还有垄断形式的报纸和电台系统，他说，这种“经济检查”是占了突出地位的一种检查。
    埃尔曼说，国际新闻工作者协会的代表大会曾要求联合国确立取缔新闻检查制度的原则，设法保证新闻界有言论自由而不受金融势力的操纵。但是，到目前为止，联合国的专门机构什么也没有做。
    埃尔曼提到1956年赫尔辛基国际新闻工作者会见通过的决议中认为应当让记者自由来往，不受障碍。埃尔曼说，但是，我们常常看见拒绝给予出境签证的事情，例如美国曾企图撤销三个到过人民中国的记者的护照。埃尔曼说，这也是一种障碍。
    埃尔曼谈到忠实新闻报道的障碍，他谴责有些报纸力求利用虚假新闻来吸引公众，所谓耸人听闻的新闻就是歪曲的报道，还有些新闻详细叙述一切反社会的行为案件，这种做法降低了报纸和读者的水平。埃尔曼谴责这种新闻事业的堕落。
    埃尔曼说，新闻工作者的行为必须符合新闻职业所必需的尊严。国际新闻工作者协会同意制定一部新闻工作者的国际荣誉法典，法典中应包括：提供准确而客观的报道，反对制造仇恨和挑拨战争心理、禁止剽窃等等。
    埃尔曼说，我经常听到美国专家和记者一谈起报纸就谈到“新闻企业”“新闻工业”之类的话，我相信我们许多人都这样想，新闻不是一种商业，也不是一种工业。埃尔曼说，一切曾经努力领导报纸的人，心中就应该牢记卡尔·马克思的话：“报纸的首要自由，就在于不成为一种实业。”
    埃尔曼还谈到记者的培养和训练问题。他说，记者的最好职业训练不是纯技术训练，而是造就一些能名副其实的记者，而这些记者同时又是真正有修养的人。
    埃尔曼最后说，我们这些新闻工作者，都是散布在各大洲的、属于不同种族、不同肤色、不同宗教信仰、不同意见的但却聚集在一起的彼此接近的人们，其所以聚集在一起，是因为我们执行着同一的行业，我们担负着同样的责任。如果我们希望能够对于我们的职业感到骄傲，这就要求无论在什么地方都能够在诚实和有效率的条件下执行业务从而为公众利益服务。千百万人都只能从我们告诉他们的东西中得到消息。我们不愿意欺骗他们，我们愿意帮助他们更好地了解他们自身的问题和他们的利益所在，我们不愿意煽动或散播仇恨，我们希望各国人民彼此更好地认识、更好地了解和更好地相爱。我们不愿意降低公众的思想，我们愿意教育和提高他们的思想。在使他们的思想愉快的同时，我们不愿意使他们的思想颓废和堕落。我们不愿意为战争而工作，我们愿意打开和平的大门。因此，我们总是在寻求一切机会同我们世界各国的所有同志们和同行们共同工作。
    新华社3日讯　在今天下午举行的国际新闻工作者协会执行委员会会议上，协会秘书长雅罗斯拉夫·克诺布洛赫说，全世界新闻工作者的广泛合作在过去是，将来也还是国际新闻工作者协会的主要任务。我们将尽所有的力量，促使各国新闻工作者的广泛合作和组织上的团结得以实现。
    下午的会议开始后，克诺布洛赫首先在会上作了关于国际新闻工作者协会的工作报告。
    克诺布洛赫介绍了去年6月在赫尔辛基举行的国际新闻工作者会见的盛况。他说，这次会见引起了很大的反响，会见通过的各项决议，受到了国际新闻工作者协会的完全支持。
    克诺布洛赫谈到了近来各国新闻工作者合作的发展情况。他谈到计划中的亚非新闻工作者会议时说，由参加赫尔辛基会见的十四个亚非国家的新闻工作者提出的关于举行新闻工作者的“万隆会议”的倡议，将有助于加强“万隆国家”新闻工作者的合作。
    他指出，有关亚洲国家发生的事件的消息，往往是通过纽约或者伦敦传到其他亚洲国家去的，许多新闻都不完全，甚至被歪曲了；亚非新闻工作者的合作就能有助于解决这个在今天是很荒谬的问题。
    在谈到新闻工作者国际合作的各方面的问题以后，克诺布洛赫说，国际新闻工作者协会已经成为号召团结的喉舌，成为全世界一切民主新闻工作者争取实现友好合作的支柱。因此，我们的组织负有重大责任，来继续努力争取新闻工作者的团结，争取为他们创造工作上的方便条件，并且努力实现赫尔辛基会见的各项决议。
    克诺布洛赫详细报告了协会自从去年6月举行上次执行委员会会议以来的各方面的活动情况以及将来的各项工作计划。他认为，国际新闻工作者协会各会员组织之间的合作正在发展，若干国家订立了双边协定；东欧各国的科学新闻工作者学会之间的合作已经顺利展开。国际新闻工作者协会正准备在最近将来举行一些国际性的专业记者会议，以利于提高新闻工作者的职业水平，为合作和广泛交流经验、交换资料奠定基础。
    克诺布洛赫还谈到，在赫尔辛基国际新闻工作者会见后建立的国际新闻工作者合作委员会曾建议，在布鲁塞尔举行一次西方的国际新闻工作者联合会代表和国际新闻工作者协会代表之间的会见会。这两个组织的代表的直接谈判能够有助于消除误解，并且能够为建立一个统一的新闻工作者组织铺平道路。国际新闻工作者协会同意这个建议，并且愿意参加这样一次会见会，然而国际新闻工作者联合会的负责方面并没有回答这个倡议。
    克诺布洛赫报告后，会议开始进行讨论。
    德意志民主共和国新闻工作者联合会主席格·克劳斯发言。他说，德意志民主共和国的新闻工作者支持由联合国教育、科学及文化组织颁发记者证的建议，他强调说，我们的国家只能在国家间互惠的基础上承认这种记者证。这种互惠关系的唯一的办法就是保证我国参加联合国教育、科学及文化组织，享有和其他国家平等的权利。
    德意志民主共和国新闻工作者联合会第一书记华·格劳耳发言时，介绍了德意志民主共和国的各新闻机构同外国各新闻机构进行了密切接触的情况。格劳耳还以具体事实说明，赫尔辛基国际新闻工作者会见所提出的为新闻工作者的活动创造便利条件的建议，在德意志民主共和国已经在很大程度上实现了。
    格劳耳指出，西德新闻工作者在德意志民主共和国活动可以具备一切工作条件；可是德意志民主共和国到西德旅行的许多新闻工作者不仅在行动自由方面遭到阻挠，甚至还常遭到非法逮捕，这是对新闻工作的一种绝顶的蔑视。
    保加利亚新闻工作者协会副主席、“工人事业报”副总编辑维列夫发言。他说，国际新闻工作者协会的活动，受到保加利亚新闻工作者的欢迎，他们认真贯彻和执行它的决议。
    维列夫说，1956年下半年保加利亚新闻工作者协会派出了一百六十七名记者出国访问，同时也招待了一百九十六名外国记者到保加利亚访问。即使那些自动提出要访问保加利亚的新闻工作者，保加利亚也从未拒绝给他们入境签证。但当保加利亚记者提出访问某些西方国家的时候，这些国家却放下铁幕来阻挡我们。例如，去年到联合国大会去的保加利亚记者费了很大力气才弄到进入美国的签证，可是不能走出纽约市一步，甚至在市内行动也受限制。
    罗马尼亚“火花报”编委维克多·巴拉德亚努发言。他说，罗马尼亚的新闻工作者用各种办法报道我国人民为建设祖国和为世界和平工作的意愿，有许多新闻工作者得到了国家奖金。
    巴拉德亚努详细介绍了罗马尼亚新闻工作者开展各种有益的活动以及同各国新闻同业建立了广泛联系的情况。
    他指责英国、意大利、奥地利等国的一些报纸和电台对罗马尼亚共和国的恶意宣传，并建议这次会议向联合国教育、科学及文化组织发出呼吁，要各国新闻工作者遵守忠实新闻报道的原则。
    他最后说，希望国际新闻工作者协会执行委员会下一届会议到布加勒斯特举行。
    蒙古“真理报”副主编奥奇连·彭查格发言时说，在蒙古平均每三个人就有一份报纸和一份杂志，国家十分重视通过高等学校和专门的训练班来培养新闻工作干部。蒙古新闻工作者拥护国际新闻工作者协会为加强和平和各国人民的友谊而在新闻工作者中间所进行的工作。
    最后发言的是墨西哥记者格雷戈丽亚·罗萨斯·埃雷拉。他说，在墨西哥有人在制造障碍，破坏国际新闻工作者的合作和团结，一个泛美的新闻工作者组织正在大肆活动，这个组织还获得了驻拉丁美洲各国的美国大使馆的支持。他说，墨西哥新闻工作者的处境是相当困难的，但墨西哥的新闻工作者都坚定地为和平和独立而斗争。他最后代表国际新闻工作者协会墨西哥分会向会议致诚恳的祝贺，祝全世界的新闻工作者团结和友好。
    会上，宣读了因故未能前来列席会议的日本记者会议干事本田良介给会议的祝贺信。
    在下午会议结束以前，会议通过了起草会议文件的三个委员会的组成人员名单。（附图片）
