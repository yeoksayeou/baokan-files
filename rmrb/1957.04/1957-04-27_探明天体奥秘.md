    Exploring the Mysteries of Celestial Bodies
    A meteorite that fell to earth more than forty years ago was recently transported from Meixian County, Guangdong, to South China Normal College to serve as a specimen for direct study of celestial bodies. It was discovered by a student of the college's Geography Department during a holiday trip back to his hometown. With the consent of the relevant departments in Meixian County, it was brought back to the college. This meteorite was discovered by farmers in Neicun Mountain, Meixian County, in 1915. Not knowing what it was, they chiseled off one-third of it to use as a foundation for a wall. What remains is only two-thirds, weighing 374 pounds.
    After research by Hu Jisheng, associate professor of astronomy, and Huang Demin, lecturer in geology, both of the college's Geography Department, it was confirmed to be a meteorite. Professor Hu said: Meteorites, like meteoroids, are materials that fall to the ground from fractured celestial bodies. A meteoroid is the surface part of a meteorite, and a meteorite is its core, which falls down very rarely. The ratio of meteoroid falls to meteorite falls is sixteen to one. Meteorites and meteoroids are of extreme importance for studying the material unity of the universe and other astronomical and terrestrial problems.

    探明天体奥秘
    四十多年前降落到地面的一块陨铁，最近从广东梅县运到华南师范学院，作为直接研究天体的标本。这是该院地理系学生假期回乡时发现的。经梅县有关部门同意，运回该院。这块陨铁是1915年梅县农民在内村山中发现的，他不知道是什么东西，就凿去三分之一作了墙脚，现存的只是三分之二，重达三百七十四斤。
    经该院地理系天文学副教授胡继胜和地质学讲师黄德民研究之后，证明确是陨铁。胡教授说：陨铁和陨石一样，都是从破裂的天体中降落到地面来的物质，陨石是它的表面部分，陨铁是它的核心，降下来的机会很少。陨石与陨铁降落的比例是十六比一。陨石和陨铁对研究宇宙的物质统一性问题以及其他天文学和地球问题有极重要的意义。
