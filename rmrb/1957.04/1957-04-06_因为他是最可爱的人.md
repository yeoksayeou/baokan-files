    Because He Is The Most Lovable Person
    Lin Xiufen
    Fang Zhangliang is a Communist Party member. He was awarded two first-class merits and two minor merits in the Liberation War and the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. Later, he was wounded in a fierce battle on the Korean front. Because of his severe injuries, he had both feet amputated to save his life.
    I first met Fang Zhangliang in Nanjing. At that time, he was recuperating from his injuries, and many of us went to see and慰问 him. I almost shed tears when I saw his injuries were so severe. But he was not at all depressed by his disability, and he was always so cheerful. We were deeply moved by this spirit of revolutionary optimism, and we laughed and asked him to tell us battle stories. He spoke eloquently. When we asked him to tell us about how he was injured, he smiled and said, "There's nothing to talk about. I'm just one of the Chinese People's Volunteers." Under our repeated requests, he simply told us how he was injured: the battle was fierce, and they were fighting hand-to-hand with the enemy. During the enemy's first charge, his left foot was blown to pieces. The battle became increasingly fierce. The instructor saw that he was seriously wounded and told him to leave the front line, but he insisted on fighting, and as a result, his right foot was also blown off. We asked him, "You were already injured, and the instructor told you to leave the front line, why didn't you come down?" He said, "I couldn't, the enemy hadn't been eliminated yet. I am a Communist Party member, and I can't leave the battle for a moment!"
    After I returned home, I kept thinking about his words. I also thought: what was he fighting for when he insisted on fighting? What was he injured for? And what is he living so optimistically and happily for now?
    Later, Comrade Fang Zhangliang was discharged from the hospital and went to work at the Zhejiang Rehabilitation School. I was studying at the school. From our frequent correspondence, I knew that he was studying hard, with ten to twelve classes every day. At the end of the semester, he sent me his transcript, and his grades were all four or five. I was so ashamed! Because my grades were not good enough. I thought: in the past, he bravely killed the enemy on the front line; today, he is disabled, but he still studies so hard and achieves excellent results. Can't I overcome the small difficulties in my studies? I want to learn from him and catch up. I often compare myself to him and encourage myself, and as a result, I made rapid progress, my grades improved, and I also joined the Communist Youth League.
    Fang Zhangliang's heroic deeds, excellent ideological qualities, and his encouragement and help to me gradually made me fall in love with him. At that time, I wanted to express my feelings to him, but I thought, he would find it strange, and even disbelieve me. Because I am a high school student; and he is a disabled person. But I still wrote him a letter with ardent faith, expressing my love. Soon, I received a reply from Fang Zhangliang. As I expected, he said in his letter: You know that I am a disabled soldier without feet. Let's not talk about these things, let's talk about studying and working! So, I wrote another more detailed letter, expressing my sincere love. We finally developed from a general comrade relationship into a lover relationship.
    In March of last year, Fang Zhangliang returned to his hometown after being away for eight or nine years and worked in the senior agricultural cooperative as an economic cashier and a cultural welfare committee member. In his work, he closely contacted the masses and publicized the Party's policies, which was praised by the masses. His spirit of diligence in his work further encouraged me. After three or four years of mutual understanding and love, we finally got married last August after I graduated from high school. After the marriage, our relationship is even better. In order to take better care of Fang Zhangliang, the organization transferred me to work at the Changhua County Post and Telecommunications Bureau in Zhejiang. Since then, I have always tried my best to take care of him and not let him have any difficulties. I am afraid that he will walk too much on his artificial legs and cause skin inflammation, so every day after get off work, I buy food and bring it back to eat, and I always give him the first-class dishes and eat the third-class dishes myself. His body is relatively weak, and I usually buy him cod liver oil, blood tonic pills and other supplements. When it gets cold, I tell him to put on more clothes because I'm afraid he'll catch a cold; when I see that his quilt is not covered properly when he sleeps, I cover him up; his artificial legs make it difficult for him to walk, and I'm afraid he'll fall, so I help him walk, especially on rainy days, when he crosses thresholds, goes up and down slopes, and goes to the toilet, I help him walk. Every morning, I get up early to bring him the water for washing his face. After arranging what he eats and uses, I go to work on time. His personality is relatively strong, and sometimes his temper is relatively impatient. I often help him ideologically, explaining the impact of this on his health and the harm to his work. Now he no longer has impatient expressions. In terms of economy, besides subscribing to newspapers, buying novels, political theory books, etc., with the money he earns every month, I always persuade him not to spend it indiscriminately. In addition to our monthly expenses, the remaining money is deposited in the bank.
    Some people ask me: Why marry a person without feet? There is nothing else, but under the education of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, I love my motherland, love our common cause, and love the "most lovable person." (Attached photo)

    因为他是最可爱的人
    林秀芬
    方章良是共产党员。在解放战争和抗美援朝战争中立过两次大功和两次小功。后来在朝鲜前线的一次激烈战斗中负了伤。因为伤势很重，被截去了双脚才保全了生命。
    我和方章良第一次见面是在南京。当时他正因伤休养，我们很多人一齐去看他、慰问他。我看见他的伤势那么重，几乎掉下眼泪来。但是他一点也不因残废而情绪沮丧，始终是那样愉快。我们深为这种革命乐观主义的精神所感动，也就笑着要求他讲战斗故事。他就滔滔不绝地讲起来了。当我们要求他讲讲自己负伤的经过时，他笑着说：“这没有什么好讲，我只是人民志愿军中的一个罢了。”在我们再三要求下，他才简单地讲了自己是怎样负伤的：那次战斗很激烈，他们与敌人混战在一起。敌人第一次冲锋时，他的左脚就被炸碎了。战斗越来越激烈。指导员见他伤重，叫他下火线，但他仍然坚持着战斗，结果又被炸断了右脚。我们问他：“已经负伤了，指导员叫你下火线，你为什么不下来呢？”他说：“不能呀，敌人还没有被消灭，我是个共产党员，一刻也不能离开战斗！”
    我回家后，不断地想着他的谈话。还想：他坚持战斗为了什么？他负伤为了什么？而现在他那样乐观、愉快地生活又为了什么？
    后来方章良同志出院了，到浙江荣校工作，我在学校里学习。从我们经常的书信往来中，我知道他在艰苦地学习，每天有十节到十二节课。学期终了，他又寄来成绩单，学习成绩都是四分或五分。我是多么惭愧啊！因为我的学习成绩不够好。我就想：过去，他在前线英勇杀敌；今天，他残废了，还那样努力学习，取得了优良的成绩。我呢，难道在学习上的小小困难就不能克服吗？我要向他学习，迎头赶上去。我经常拿他来对照自己，勉励自己，结果进步很快，学习成绩也好了，还参加了青年团。
    方章良的英勇事迹，优良的思想品质以及他对我的鼓舞和帮助，使我逐渐地对他产生了爱情。当时我想向他表示，又想，他会感到奇怪，甚至会不相信我。因为我是个高中学生；而他呢，是一个残废者。但我还是抱着热烈的信念写信向他表示爱情。不久，我接到方章良的回信，果然不出我的意料，他信上说：我是个没有脚的残废军人，你是知道的。我们还是别谈这些，谈谈学习工作吧！于是，我就又写了一封更详细的信，表白了自己真挚的爱情。我们终于从一般的同志关系，发展成了爱人关系。
    去年3月份，方章良回到离别了八、九年的故乡，在高级社里担任了经济保管员和文化福利委员等工作。在工作中密切联系群众，宣传党的政策，受到群众的赞扬。他这种勤恳工作的精神更加鼓舞了我。我们经过了三四年的相互了解和恋爱，终于在去年8月，我在高中毕业以后结婚了。婚后，我们感情更好。组织上为了更好地照顾方章良，调我来浙江昌化县邮电局工作。这以后，我总是尽一切的力量来照顾他，不使他有任何困难。我怕他装的假脚走动太多了，引起皮肤发炎，所以每天一下班，我把饭菜买回来吃，并且总是把甲级菜给他吃，自己吃丙级菜。他的身体比较弱，平时我常买鱼肝油、补血片等补品给他吃。天冷了，怕他受凉，我叫他加衣；睡觉时见他被子没盖好，就替他盖上；他装的假脚走路不便，怕他摔跤，我扶着他走，尤其是下雨天，他跨门槛、上下坡以及上厕所，我都扶着他走。每天早晨，我都是提前起床，把洗脸水送到他面前。把吃的、用的安排好以后，我就按时上班去了。他的个性比较强，有时性情也比较急躁。我经常从思想上帮助他，说明这对身体的影响、对工作的害处。现在他不再有急躁的表现了。在经济上，他每月收入的钱除了订报、买小说、政治理论书籍等之外，我总劝他不要乱用。我们除了每月的开支外，余下的钱都存入银行。
    有人问我：为什么要和一个没脚的人结婚呢？这没有别的，不过是在共产党和毛主席的教育下，热爱自己的祖国，热爱我们共同的事业，热爱“最可爱的人”罢了。（附图片）
