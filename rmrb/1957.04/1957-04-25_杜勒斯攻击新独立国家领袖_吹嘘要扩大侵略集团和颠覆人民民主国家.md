Xinhua News Agency, New York, 23rd: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, in outlining the "basic concepts" of U.S. foreign policy at the Associated Press annual meeting on April 22, emphasized that the United States should maintain and develop its established military alliances, and that the United States should adopt a so-called "encouragement of liberation" policy towards people's democratic countries.

In his speech, he said that the United States had organized various military alliances with forty-two countries, and that according to the "Eisenhower Doctrine," these U.S. military alliance areas "may be expanded." Dulles admitted that there are "internal weaknesses" in these alliances. Their "greater danger comes from internal dangers." He demanded that countries participating in these alliances "discard selfish plans and extreme nationalist ideas that hinder unity."

Dulles said in his speech that the arms race is "costly" and "dangerous," and he also said, "We will persistently work to ensure that this arms race can be reliably ended." However, he also emphasized that the "inspection of armaments" issue must be resolved before discussing arms reduction.

Dulles also talked about the United States' "concern" for the "economic development" of economically underdeveloped countries and the "political changes" of newly independent countries. He hoped that the economic expansion of the United States in these countries could be carried out by private capital, and where the "risks are too great" and private capital is unwilling to bear them, the U.S. government can do it. Dulles attacked the actions of some newly independent countries' leaders in safeguarding sovereignty, saying that these leaders are "demonstrating newly acquired sovereignty by mocking other independent countries." The Associated Press believes that Dulles was referring here to actions such as Egypt's safeguarding of sovereignty in the Suez Canal issue.

In this speech, Dulles reiterated in part the U.S. policy of seeking the "liberation" of people's democratic countries. In view of the failure of the counter-revolutionary riots in Hungary, he said that the United States will "not incite violent rebellions," but will take measures to "encourage" "evolution" towards "freedom."

    杜勒斯攻击新独立国家领袖
    吹嘘要扩大侵略集团和颠覆人民民主国家
    据新华社23日讯　纽约消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯4月22日在美联社年会上阐述美国外交政策的“基本概念”时，强调美国要保持和发展它建立的军事联盟，美国要对人民民主国家采取所谓“鼓励解放”政策。
    他在演说里说，美国已经同四十二个国家组织了各种各样的军事联盟，根据“艾森豪威尔主义”，美国的这些军事联盟地区还“可能会有扩大”。杜勒斯承认在这些联盟中存在着“内部的弱点”。它们的“比较大的危险倒是来自内部的危险”。他要求参加这些联盟的国家“丢掉妨碍团结的自私打算和极端的民族主义思想”。
    杜勒斯在演说里谈到军备竞赛是“代价巨大的”和“危险的”，他并且说，“我们将坚持不懈地使这种军备竞赛能够可靠地结束”。但是，他又强调，要先解决“军备视察”问题，才能谈到裁减军备。
    杜勒斯还谈到美国“关心”经济不发达国家的“经济发展”和新独立国家的“政治变化”。他希望美国在这些国家的经济扩张能够由私人资本来进行，而在“风险太大”、私人资本不愿意承担的地方，可以由美国政府来进行。杜勒斯攻击某些新独立的国家的领袖维护主权的行动，他说这些领袖是“用嘲弄其他独立国家的办法来表现新得到的主权”。美联社认为，杜勒斯在这里所指的是像埃及在苏伊士运河问题上维护主权的行动。
    杜勒斯在这篇演说里有一部分重申美国要谋求“解放”人民民主国家的政策。鉴于匈牙利反革命暴乱的失败，他说，美国将“不煽动暴力的叛乱”，而是采取措施来“鼓励”向着“自由”的“演变”。
