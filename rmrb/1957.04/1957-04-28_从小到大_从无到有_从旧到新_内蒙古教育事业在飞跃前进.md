From Small to Large, From Nothing to Something, From Old to New
—Inner Mongolia's Education is Leaping Forward
Ha Feng'a, Vice Chairman of the People's Committee of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region

A Decade of Great Development

The Mongolian people are a nation with a rich cultural heritage, and have jointly created China's history and culture together with all fraternal ethnic groups. However, since being ruled by the Qing Dynasty, in the past three hundred years, they have suffered ethnic oppression, lost national unity and sovereignty, social productive forces have stagnated, people's lives have been impoverished, and national culture has stagnated in a backward stage for a long time, making the Mongolian people a culturally backward nation, thus creating a dark period for national culture.

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the people of Inner Mongolia, after a difficult struggle for national liberation, established the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on May 1, 1947, realizing the desire for national unity and liberation for more than three hundred years. Over the past ten years, with the construction and consolidation of the people's regime, the restoration and development of the people's economy, the people's cultural and educational undertakings have also been unprecedentedly developed.

In 1946, there were only 1,627 primary schools in the entire region, with 137,672 students, including 10,029 Mongolian students; now there are 9,345 primary schools, with 860,840 students, including 100,840 Mongolian students, and 13,947 students from other ethnic minorities. In 1946, there were only 22 secondary schools with 4,030 students, including 459 Mongolian students; now there are 87 secondary schools (middle schools and teachers' colleges) with 60,175 students, including 11,131 Mongolian students, and 2,479 students from other ethnic minorities. Before liberation, there was not a single regular secondary vocational school, let alone a university; now there are 18 secondary vocational schools with 9,628 students, including 542 Mongolian students, and 405 students from other ethnic minorities. Now there are three universities with 2,348 students, including 566 Mongolian students, and 95 students from other ethnic minorities. Before liberation, more than 85% of the working people were illiterate, while in 1956, 797,867 workers, cadres, farmers, herdsmen, and urban residents participated in spare-time studies, including 129,567 Mongolians.

In the past ten years, Mongolian students have grown significantly. The number of primary school students has increased by about ten times, and the number of secondary school students has increased by about twenty-six times. The proportion of primary and secondary school students has increased from about 1% of the total population before liberation to more than 10% of the population. Both in absolute numbers and in growth rate, this is unprecedented in the history of Inner Mongolia. Furthermore, due to the implementation of the policy of opening school education to workers, peasants, and herdsmen, the vast majority of students are children of working people, and the phenomenon that schools only served a few people before liberation has come to an end forever.

In addition to the development in quantity, the quality has also undergone fundamental changes. We have abolished the feudal and fascist enslavement education system and methods, and established a system and methods with socialist education as the content. Over the past ten years, our education has embarked on the track of socialist education.

In this way, Inner Mongolia's education has shown an unprecedented prosperity in the history of Inner Mongolia in terms of quantity from small to large (such as primary and secondary schools), from nothing to something (such as universities), and in terms of quality from old to new. This has begun to bring about major changes in the culturally backward appearance left over from history by the Mongolian people, and a broad prospect for national cultural development has emerged before us.

A Few Experiences

What are the reasons for the rapid development of education in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region? We have the following experiences:

First, the implementation of the great ethnic policy of the Chinese Communist Party and the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are the most fundamental guarantee and the greatest driving force for the development of education in Inner Mongolia. We know that not long after the death of Ligdan Khan of Chahar, in 1636, the forty-nine feudal lords of the sixteen tribes of Southern Mongolia convened a meeting and decided to recognize the Manchu Emperor Hong Taiji (Taizong) as the successor to the Mongolian Khan, thus Southern Mongolia completely became Inner Mongolia under the rule of the Manchu Emperor, and the dark history of national division and rule began. From 1636 to 1947, a full three hundred and ten years passed. During this long period, the people of Inner Mongolia experienced the cruel rule of the Qing Dynasty, the Han chauvinists of the Kuomintang, and Japanese imperialism. The people of Inner Mongolia have waged unyielding long-term struggles for national liberation, and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, they were finally liberated in 1945 and established the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in 1947. The common point of the vicious policies of weakening Inner Mongolia by the reactionary rulers of the past dynasties was "divide and rule," while the great ethnic policy of the Chinese Communist Party is "regional autonomy." What is the superiority of this great ethnic policy? The four-province system set up by the reactionary rulers in the past to divide Inner Mongolia was abolished, of which Suiyuan Province was completely merged into Inner Mongolia, and most of the areas of Rehe, Chahar, and Ningxia provinces were划归 (劃歸) to Inner Mongolia. The main Mongolian-inhabited areas within Liaoning and Heilongjiang provinces were also划归 (劃歸) to Inner Mongolia. In this way, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region with an area of ​​1.4 million square kilometers and a population of more than 8.7 million was born in the 1940s. The Mongolian people have realized the great unity of three hundred years in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, exercised the right of autonomy as masters of their own affairs, and closely united with the Han and other fraternal ethnic groups in the region to carry out the construction of the autonomous region.

The establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has greatly restored the national self-esteem of the people of Inner Mongolia, improved national self-confidence, and inspired the enthusiasm for political, economic, and cultural construction. With the unified national regime, the formation of a unified national economic market began, and the unified national education undertaking became possible.

Second, under the guidance of the central unified principles and policies, and on the basis of improving people's lives, the education undertaking has been developed in a planned and step-by-step manner. Inner Mongolia's education undertaking is also a part of the motherland's education undertaking. It has the national unity and also the special characteristics of the national region. Therefore, only under the guidance of the central unified principles and policies can we not lose our way on major issues. This is one aspect; on the other hand, we must fully take care of ethnic characteristics and regional characteristics, and combine the central unified principles and policies with the specific conditions of the ethnic regions. In this way, we can avoid generalized leadership.

In view of the characteristics of the Mongolian and other ethnic minorities who have been oppressed for a long time and whose education is backward, we have implemented the central policy of "opening school education to workers, peasants, and herdsmen" and "opening school education to ethnic minorities," and adopted specific measures to encourage Mongolian and other ethnic minority students to enroll and study. We have taken care of the regional characteristics and ethnic minority students in terms of school settings, admission standards, scholarship treatment, daily life, and holidays. For example, in the beginning, primary schools in purely pastoral areas were completely publicly funded, and the vast majority of students enjoyed people's scholarship treatment. In primary schools in ethnic minority areas such as Oroqen and Yakut, all expenses were paid by the government. And according to needs and possibilities, we began to distribute the school network in a planned way, gradually expanding primary and secondary schools, and increasing school equipment. Therefore, in terms of school distribution, many pastoral, mountainous, forest, and remote areas in the region that had never had schools in history now have schools. Each township in semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas has an average of about four primary schools, and most sumu in pastoral areas also have primary schools. Secondary schools (middle schools, teachers' colleges, and secondary vocational schools), such as the region as a whole, can have one or more in each banner, and each banner and county in the Jerim League actually has one or more secondary schools.

In developing education, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has not only received the leadership of the central government in terms of unified principles and policies, but also received multifaceted care and assistance from the relevant departments of the central government in specific issues. In this regard, we adhere to two principles: First, undertakings that should be run by ourselves and can be run by ourselves should be gradually run by ourselves as much as possible, without overemphasizing the particularity of the autonomous region and simply relying on the central government. For example, primary and secondary schools and some secondary vocational schools that the autonomous region urgently needs are gradually run in this way. Second, for undertakings that urgently need to be run but cannot be run by ourselves for the time being, we must actively prepare conditions on the one hand and rely on the central government to run them on the other hand. We must neither overemphasize the backwardness of the autonomous region nor be afraid of troubling the central government and hinder the development of the undertaking. The Inner Mongolia Normal College was run in this way. As for the Inner Mongolia College of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine and the Inner Mongolia Medical College, they were actively run by the relevant departments of the central government according to the needs of the party's "prosperous people and livestock" policy in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. In this regard, it can also be seen how great the central government's care and assistance to Inner Mongolia is.

As a result of the reactionary rulers' policy of愚民 (愚民政策) towards the Mongolian people, until the end of the Qing Dynasty, there was not a single regular school in the Mongolian banners of Inner Mongolia. Now we have a modern socialist education system from preschool education to higher education, and have begun to supply a large number of ethnic cadres. According to preliminary statistics, the number of Mongolian students who have graduated from various types of schools at all levels in the past ten years is: 368 in universities, 5,103 in secondary schools (excluding vocational schools), and 122,141 in primary schools. Students who have graduated from various short-term training courses and various types of schools at all levels outside the region are not included.

Third, carrying out socialist content education through ethnic forms is an important key to the development of education in Inner Mongolia. After the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, various Mongolian textbooks began to be compiled and printed, and the policy of self-compiling language textbooks and translating and using nationally unified textbooks for other textbooks was adopted. In the past ten years, 115 types of Mongolian primary and secondary school textbooks have been published, with 4,555,854 copies, thus basically solving the textbook problem. The solution of ethnic language textbooks not only facilitates teaching in ethnic languages, guarantees the smooth development of ethnic education, but also the process of solving ethnic language textbooks is also the process of initially reforming teaching in ethnic schools, ensuring that students can be educated in correct ideological viewpoints and scientific knowledge. This is of great significance.

To carry out socialist education through ethnic forms, there must be a large number of ethnic teachers. In terms of training ethnic teachers, the main thing is to implement the party's policy on intellectuals, unite and educate intellectuals of all ethnic groups to serve as teachers. In the beginning, we cannot demand too much, but we must pay attention to training and improving them. On the other hand, we should open short-term training courses to train new teachers and inject new blood, and gradually transition from short-term training courses to regular teachers' college training of teachers. At the same time, by means of gradual promotion, we boldly promoted primary school teachers to teach junior high school, junior high school teachers to teach senior high school, and senior high school teachers to serve as teachers in teachers' colleges, solving the difficulties of the serious lack of ethnic teachers in some secondary and higher schools. According to preliminary statistics, the number of Mongolian teachers in various types of schools at all levels is now: 57 in universities, 460 in secondary schools, and 4,205 in primary schools.

Fourth, ethnic unity education is the main content of political and ideological education in Inner Mongolia schools. In addition to the Mongolian ethnic group, there are also Han and other ethnic minorities in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Due to the long-term instigation by the reactionary ruling classes in the past, the ethnic relations were not harmonious enough. Therefore, improving ethnic relations in Inner Mongolia is one of the prerequisites for carrying out all work, and education is no exception. At the same time, education should become an important tool for improving ethnic relations. Education in Inner Mongolia paid attention to this from the beginning, and carried out ethnic policy education through classroom teaching, especially in conjunction with internationalism and patriotism education. Through participating in various social movements such as land reform and 抗美援朝 (Resist America, Aid Korea), teachers and students of all ethnic groups deeply realized the consistency of the interests of the working people of all ethnic groups, and began to overcome the ideological tendencies of Han chauvinism and local nationalism. With the establishment and consolidation of new ethnic unity relations in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the ethnic unity relations in schools at all levels have been further improved. Generally, close friendship and love are expressed between teachers of all ethnic groups, between teachers and students of all ethnic groups, and between students of all ethnic groups, and this relationship promotes mutual respect and mutual learning, promotes Han cadres to work in Inner Mongolia with peace of mind, and at the same time promotes Mongolian and other ethnic minority students to study the advanced culture of the Han ethnic group well. In this way, the development of new ethnic relations and the active participation of a large number of Han cadres in the construction of education in Inner Mongolia have promoted the development of education in Inner Mongolia.

Fifth, learning advanced experience and absorbing advanced culture are important conditions for the development of education in Inner Mongolia. This work not only promotes the development of education, but is also an indispensable work for enriching and improving national culture. In this regard, we mainly learn the advanced experience and culture of the Han and other fraternal ethnic groups, and pay attention to learning the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and the Mongolian People's Republic. In learning advanced experience, we have opposed both the conservative ideology of sticking to the old ways and the impetuous mood of mechanically copying, and have paid attention to combining advanced experience with ethnic characteristics. For example, learning the Han language is an important means of learning the advanced experience of the Han ethnic group and absorbing advanced culture, but we have had confusion in its implementation. That is, we started to learn two languages ​​from the lower grades of primary school in agricultural areas, which resulted in the phenomenon that both languages ​​could not be learned well, affecting the work of laying the foundation for ethnic language education. On the other hand, in pastoral areas, we did not learn the prescribed Chinese language courses at all, which affected the expansion of students' knowledge horizons. After research on these phenomena, it was stipulated that Chinese language courses should be added to the upper grades of primary school regardless of agricultural or pastoral areas, requiring that the prescribed Chinese language courses be learned on the basis of laying a good foundation for ethnic language learning. This is more realistic. For example, using textbooks from the Mongolian People's Republic can save us a lot of translation time, but we must make some examples of it relate to the actual situation in China.

New Stage, New Tasks

Just as the first five-year plan for socialist construction of the great motherland began, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region also entered the stage of building the autonomous region from the stage of promoting regional autonomy, which also marked that the autonomous region had entered a new stage of socialist construction, and achieved a great victory in socialist transformation in 1956. Facing this great new socialist stage, how should the people of Inner Mongolia develop into a modern socialist nation? What are the new tasks of education in Inner Mongolia?

Regarding this issue, Comrade Liu Shaoqi clearly pointed out in the political report of the "Eighth National Congress": "To develop into modern nations, all ethnic minorities, in addition to carrying out social reforms, the fundamental key is to develop modern industry in their regions." At the same time, the political resolution of the "Eighth National Congress" stipulated the tasks of paying close attention to the nationalization of the ethnic autonomous organs and cultivating the working class and industrial cadres of the ethnic minorities themselves. According to these instructions and resolutions, we should deeply understand that to realize the industrialization of the autonomous region and the nationalization of the organs of the autonomous region, we must make the greatest efforts to cultivate the ethnic working class and the ethnic scientific and technical cadres.

The construction of the Baotou industrial base and other central state-owned industries in our region is a superior condition for the industrialization of the autonomous region. This is the key to fundamentally changing the backward appearance of the autonomous region. The people of Inner Mongolia welcome these constructions with the greatest gratitude and will support them with all possible conditions.

Therefore, the central task of education in Inner Mongolia in the future is no longer clear, that is, to improve the cultural level of the people of all ethnic groups, form an ethnic working class, and vigorously train ethnic scientific and technical cadres to actively participate in the socialist construction of the motherland and the autonomous region, so that the Mongolian and other ethnic minorities will gradually develop into modern socialist nations.

    从小到大　从无到有　从旧到新
    ——内蒙古教育事业在飞跃前进
    内蒙古自治区人民委员会副主席　哈丰阿
    十年来的大发展
    蒙古民族是拥有丰富文化遗产的民族，曾同各兄弟民族共同创造了我国的历史和文化。但自从被清朝统治以来，在过去三百多年间，备受民族压迫，丧失了民族统一和主权，社会生产力陷于停顿，人民生活雕弊，民族文化长期停滞在落后阶段，使蒙古民族成为文化上的落后民族，因而造成了民族文化的黑暗时期。
    内蒙古人民在中国共产党的领导之下，经过了民族解放的艰苦斗争，在1947年5月1日建立了内蒙古自治区，实现了三百多年来民族统一解放的愿望。十年来，随着人民政权的建设和巩固，人民经济的恢复和发展，人民的文化教育事业也得到了空前的发展。
    1946年全区只有小学一千六百二十七所，学生十三万七千六百七十二人，其中蒙古族学生一万零二十九人；现在有小学九千三百四十五所，学生八十六万零八百四十人，其中蒙古族学生十万零八千四百人，其他少数民族学生一万三千九百四十七人。1946年中等学校只有二十二所，学生四千零三十人，其中蒙古族学生四百五十九人；现在有中等学校（中学和师范）八十七所，学生六万零一百七十五人，其中蒙古族学生一万一千一百三十一人，其他少数民族学生二千四百七十九人。解放前没有一所正规的中等专业学校，更谈不上高等学校了；现在有中等专业学校十八所，学生九千六百二十八人，其中蒙古族学生五百四十二人，其他少数民族学生四百零五人。现在有高等学校三所，学生二千三百四十八人，其中蒙古族学生五百六十六人，其他少数民族学生九十五人。解放前85％以上的劳动人民都是文盲，而在1956年参加业余学习的职工、干部、农民、牧民、市民有七十九万七千八百六十七人，其中蒙古族十二万九千五百六十七人。
    十年来，蒙古族学生有了很大的增长，小学生增长了约十倍，中等学校学生增长了约二十六倍，中小学生已由解放前占人口总数1％左右增长到占人口10％以上。这在绝对数字上或者在增长速度上都是内蒙古历史上前所未有的。并且由于贯彻执行了学校教育向工、农、牧劳动人民开门的方针，学生的绝大部分都是劳动人民子弟，解放前的学校只为少数人服务的现象，已经永远结束了。
    除了数量上的发展以外，质量也起了根本的变化。我们废除了封建的、法西斯奴化教育的制度和方法，建立了以社会主义教育为内容的制度和方法，十年来我们的教育已经走上了社会主义教育的轨道。
    这样，内蒙古教育在数量上从小到大（如中小学），从无到有（如高等学校），在质量上从旧到新，而呈现了内蒙古历史上空前的繁荣景象，这就使蒙古民族在历史上遗留下来的文化落后面貌开始起着重大变化，民族文化发展的广阔远景已经呈现在我们面前了。
      几点体会
    内蒙古自治区教育事业得到飞跃发展的原因在哪里呢？我们有以下几点体会：
    第一，中国共产党伟大民族政策的贯彻，内蒙古自治区的建立，是内蒙古教育事业发展的最基本的保证，也是最大的推动力。我们知道在察哈尔林丹汗死后不久，于1636年漠南蒙古十六部四十九封建领主召开大会，决议承认满洲皇帝皇太极（太宗）继承蒙古可汗的大统，于是漠南蒙古完全成为满洲皇帝统治下的内蒙古，而开始了民族被分割统治的黑暗历史。自1636年至1947年整整经过了三百一十年。在这漫长时间里，内蒙古人民经历了清朝、国民党大汉族主义者和日本帝国主义的残酷统治。内蒙古人民为了争取民族解放，曾经进行不屈不挠的长期斗争，而在中国共产党领导之下，终于在1945年得到解放，并在1947年建立了内蒙古自治区。过去历代的反动统治者削弱内蒙古的毒辣政策的共同点就是“分而治之”，而中国共产党伟大的民族政策是“区域自治”。这一伟大的民族政策的优越性是如何呢？过去反动统治者为了分割内蒙古而设的四个省制被取消了，其中绥远省完全合并于内蒙古，热河、察哈尔和宁夏三省的绝大部分地区划归了内蒙古，辽宁和黑龙江省内的主要蒙古族居住地区也都划归了内蒙古，就这样，拥有一百四十万平方公里面积，八百七十万多人口的内蒙古自治区在二十世纪四十年代诞生了。蒙古民族人民在内蒙古自治区内实现了三百年来的大统一，实行了当家作主的自治权利，而和区内的汉族及其他兄弟民族亲密团结，进行着自治区的建设。
    内蒙古自治区的建立，大大地恢复了内蒙古人民的民族自尊心，提高了民族自信心，鼓舞了政治、经济和文化建设的积极性。有了民族的统一政权，民族的统一经济市场的开始形成，民族的统一教育事业也才有了发展的可能。
    第二，在中央统一方针政策的指导下，在人民生活改善的基础上，有计划有步骤地发展了教育事业。内蒙古教育事业也是祖国教育事业的一部分，它有着全国的统一性，也有着民族地方的特殊性。因此，只有在中央统一方针政策的指导下，才能在重大问题上不致迷失方向，这是一方面；另一方面，必须充分照顾民族特点和地区特点，使中央统一的方针政策和民族地区的具体情况结合起来，这样，才能避免一般化的领导。
    我们针对蒙古及其它少数民族由于长期受压迫，教育落后的特点，贯彻了中央“学校教育向工、农、牧劳动人民开门”和“学校教育为少数民族开门”的方针，采取了鼓励蒙古族及其他少数民族学生入学学习的具体措施，在学校设置、升学录取标准、助学金待遇、日常生活和假期等方面都照顾了地区特点和少数民族学生。如：在开始时，纯牧区小学完全公办，并有绝大部分学生享受人民助学金待遇。在鄂伦春、雅库特等少数民族地区的小学，则实行全部公费待遇。并根据需要与可能，开始有计划地分布了学校网，逐步扩建了中小学，增加了学校设备。因而在学校分布上，区内许多历史上从来没有过学校的牧区、山区、林区以及边远地区都有了学校，半农半牧区每个乡平均约有四所小学，牧区大部分苏木也都有了小学。中等学校（中学、师范、中等专业学校）如全区平均则每个旗都能有一所以上，而哲里木盟各旗、县实际上都有了一所或者一所以上的中等学校。
    内蒙古自治区在发展教育事业方面，不但在统一方针政策方面得到了中央的领导，在具体问题上也同样得到了中央有关部门多方面的照顾和帮助。在这方面我们奉行的原则有两个：首先是，应自办而且能自办的事业，尽量逐步自办，不过分强调自治区的特殊性，而单纯地依赖中央。比如中小学和自治区迫切需要的某些中等专业学校就是这样逐步办起来的。其次是，迫切需要办但暂时不能自办的事业，那就必须一方面积，极准备条件，一方面依靠中央来办，既不能过分强调自治区的落后性，又不能怕麻烦中央而妨碍了事业的发展。内蒙古师范学院就是这样办起来的。至于内蒙古畜牧兽医学院和内蒙古医学院是中央有关部门根据党在内蒙古自治区执行“人畜两旺”政策的需要而主动办起来的，在这方面也可看出中央对内蒙古的照顾和帮助是何等之大。
    由于历代反动统治者对蒙古民族实行愚民政策的结果，一直到清朝末叶，内蒙古各蒙旗没有一所正规学校。现在我们已经拥有了从学前教育一直到高等教育的现代的社会主义的教育体系，并且已经开始供应着大批的民族干部。根据初步统计，十年来在各级各类学校毕业的蒙古族学生有：高等学校三百六十八人，中等学校（不包括专业学校）五千一百零三人，小学十二万二千一百四十一人。在各种短期训练班和在区外各级各类学校毕业的学生都未包括在内。
    第三，通过民族形式，进行社会主义内容的教育，是内蒙古教育事业发展的重要关键。内蒙古自治区建立后就开始编印各种蒙文教材，采取了语文课教材自编，其他教材则译用全国统一教材的方针，十年来，出版蒙文中、小学教科书一百一十五种，四百五十万五千八百五十四册，这样基本上解决了教材问题。民族语文教材的解决，不但便利了以民族语文进行教学，保证了民族教育的顺利发展，并且解决民族语文教材的过程，也就是初步对民族学校进行教学改革的过程，保证了能以正确的思想观点向学生进行政治思想和科学知识的教育，这个意义是很大的。
    通过民族形式进行社会主义教育，必须有大批的民族师资，在培养民族师资方面，主要是贯彻党的知识分子政策，团结教育各族知识分子担任教员，开始时不能要求过高，但必须注意训练提高；另一方面，开办短期训练班，训练新的教员，注入新的血液，并逐渐由短期训练班过渡到正规师范训练教员。同时，以逐级提拔的办法，大胆提拔小学教师教初中，提拔初中教师教高中，提拔高中教师当师范学院教师，解决了一些中等和高等学校非常缺少民族师资的困难。据初步统计，现在各级各类学校中蒙古族的教师已有：高等学校五十七人，中等学校四百六十人，小学四千二百零五人。
    第四，民族团结教育是内蒙古学校进行政治思想教育的主要内容。内蒙古自治区除蒙古民族外，还有汉族和其他少数民族。由于过去长期受反动统治阶级的挑拨离间，民族关系是不够融洽的。因之，在内蒙古地区改善民族关系，是开展一切工作的前提条件之一，教育工作也不能例外，同时，教育工作应当成为改善民族关系的重要工具。内蒙古教育一开始就注意到了这一点，通过课堂教学，特别是结合着国际主义和爱国主义教育进行了民族政策教育，并通过参加土地改革、抗美援朝等各种社会运动，各族教员及学生深深体会到各族劳动人民利害的一致，开始克服了大民族主义及地方民族主义的思想倾向。随着内蒙古自治区新的民族团结关系的建立和巩固，各级学校中的民族团结关系也得到进一步改善，各族教员间，各族教员与学生间，各族学生间，一般地表现着亲密友爱，而这种关系推动着互相尊重、互相学习，推动汉族干部安心于内蒙古工作，同时推动蒙古及其他少数民族学生很好地学习着汉族的先进文化。这样，新的民族关系的发展，大批汉族干部的积极参加内蒙古教育建设工作，推动了内蒙古教育的发展。
    第五，学习先进经验，吸收先进文化，是内蒙古教育事业发展的重要条件。这个工作不但促进教育事业的发展，而且也是丰富和提高民族文化的必不可少的工作。在这方面我们主要学习的是汉族和其他兄弟民族的先进经验和文化，并注意学习了苏联和蒙古人民共和国的先进经验。在学习先进经验方面，我们既反对了故步自封的保守思想，也反对了生搬硬套的急躁情绪，而注意使先进经验与民族特点相结合起来。比如：学习汉语文是学习汉族先进经验和吸收先进文化的重要手段，但我们在执行上有过混乱，这就是在农区从小学低年级就开始学习两种文字，结果造成了两种文字都学不好的现象，影响了民族语文教育打好基础的工作，另一方面在牧区则完全未学规定的汉文课程，而影响了学生知识眼界的扩展。这些现象经过了研究之后，规定了小学高年级不分农牧区一律添设汉文课程，要求在打好民族语文学习的基础上，学会规定的汉文课程，这样才切合实际。又如：利用蒙古人民共和国的教材，能使我们节省很多的翻译时间，但必须使它某些实例联系中国实际。
    新阶段新任务
    正当伟大祖国社会主义建设第一个五年计划开始时，内蒙古自治区也由推行区域自治阶段进到了建设自治区阶段，这也就是标志着自治区已经进入社会主义建设的新阶段，并且在1956年取得了社会主义改造的伟大胜利。面临着这个伟大的社会主义新阶段，内蒙古人民应该如何发展成为现代的社会主义民族呢？内蒙古教育工作的新任务是什么呢？
    关于这个问题，刘少奇同志在“八大”的政治报告中明确指出：“各少数民族要发展成为现代民族，除进行社会改革以外，根本的关键是要在他们的地区发展现代工业。”同时，“八大”政治决议中规定了切实注意民族自治机关的民族化和培养少数民族自己的工人阶级和工业干部的任务。根据这些指示和决议，我们应该深刻认识要实现自治区的工业化和自治区机关的民族化，那就要作最大努力来培养民族的工人阶级和民族的科学技术干部。
    包头工业基地和其他中央国营工业的在我区建设，是自治区工业化的优越条件，这是从根本上改变自治区落后面貌的关键所在，内蒙古人民以最大的感激心情迎接这些建设，并且要用一切可能条件来加以支援。
    因此，今后内蒙古教育工作的中心任务再明白也没有了，那就是，提高各族人民文化水平，形成民族的工人阶级，并大力培养民族的科学技术干部，积极参加祖国和自治区的社会主义建设，使蒙古及其他少数民族逐步发展成为现代的社会主义民族。（附图片）
