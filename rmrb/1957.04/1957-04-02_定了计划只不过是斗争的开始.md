Setting a Plan is Just the Beginning of the Struggle
By Our Hunan Reporter Station

As spring plowing and sowing are about to begin universally, most counties and townships have already formulated or revised their agricultural production plans for this year as concrete goals to strive for a bumper harvest. However, does the completion of a plan necessarily mean that cadres and members have sufficient confidence and determination to realize it? Some situations that occurred in Liling County, Hunan, show that this is not entirely the case.

Liling is one of the nationally renowned high-yield rice counties. Last year, more than 600,000 farmers across the county overcame a severe drought unseen in a century, achieving a good result of an average yield of 710 jin of rice per mu. This year, after repeated investigations and research, the county party committee decided to strive to become a "thousand-jin yield county."

On March 18th, we invited the directors of four agricultural cooperatives in Liling to a symposium. These four cooperatives all suffered from drought last year; some had reduced production compared to 1955, and some had increased production. When discussing this year's thousand-jin yield campaign, we asked: "Do the vast majority of farmers have the confidence to achieve it?" They calculated and said, "80% of the people have confidence, 20% do not." "So many people lack confidence, what do you plan to do?" "Most of these 20% are old, weak, widowed, or orphaned households. As long as the cadres become active, they will follow along."

This is naturally correct; the masses always look to the cadres. However, do all grassroots cadres have this kind of confidence? Judging from the situation in Liling, this is not necessarily the case. It is said that about 10% of grassroots cadres, like those 20% of cooperative members, lose their confidence in striving for a thousand-jin yield when they think of last year's great drought and some of the errors and shortcomings in agricultural production last year.

Liling put forward the slogan of striving for a thousand-jin yield last year, but it was not achieved. The main reason was the unprecedented drought. The elderly said that they had not seen a shortage of rain in the summer, autumn, and winter seasons in Hunan for generations. As a result, more than 20,000 mu of paddy fields could not be planted, more than 70,000 mu of late rice had no harvest due to drought, and more than 180,000 mu of late rice had reduced production due to drought. The sum of these three numbers is equivalent to two-fifths of the county's cultivated land. No wonder some cadres said, "Who knows if there will be a drought this year!" Some mistakes were also made in agricultural technical measures last year. Double-cropping rice was planted on 90% of the cultivated land, most of which increased production, but a few reduced production due to unsuitable soil, water conservancy, and other conditions. The blind promotion of several thousand mu of "Aomori No. 5" japonica rice also resulted in a reduction in rice production...

These cadres who lack confidence only see the side of disaster and reduced production last year, but they do not see another more important aspect: although the drought was so severe, the total agricultural output of the county was still no less than the bumper harvest of 1955; 75.1% of the cooperatives increased production, and 72% of the members increased income; there were 154 cooperatives with yields of more than a thousand jin, 427 cooperatives with yields of more than 800 jin, and only 209 cooperatives with yields of less than 800 jin.

The county party committee's view is different from these cadres. The county party committee not only comprehensively analyzed the achievements and shortcomings of agricultural production last year, but also sufficiently estimated the favorable conditions for striving for a thousand-jin yield this year: First, last year, the merger and upgrading of cooperatives and agricultural production were carried out simultaneously. The county party committee was fighting with two fists, and the leadership could not concentrate its strength. This year, the problem of agricultural collectivization has been basically solved, and the county party committee can concentrate on leading production. Second, the leading organs and cooperative members have accumulated some experience in developing large-scale production under the new circumstances. For example, last year, the county party committee proposed planting double-cropping rice on 90% of the land, which proved to be a bit too much. This year, it is proposed to plant 60% to 70%, and based on last year's experience, it is stipulated that five types of unsuitable fields should not be planted with double-cropping rice. After a year of practice, cooperative members have also begun to master new technologies such as planting double-cropping rice and preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests. Third, the water conservancy conditions this year are much better than last year. In 1955, the weather was good, and in the spring of 1956, when repairing water conservancy, it was almost impossible to know where to put in the effort. The great drought of 1956 exposed the weak points in drought resistance; this year's water conservancy work has been focused on these areas, using a total of three million workdays, greatly enhancing drought resistance. Fourth, the material conditions this year are also better than last year. Fertilizer has increased by one to two times. Last year, seeds, farm tools, and draft animals were collected temporarily, and the quantity was insufficient and the quality was not high; with a year of accumulation, these things are more numerous and neater than last year. With these conditions, as long as there are no serious natural disasters, striving for a "thousand-jin yield county" -- a yield of 900 jin of rice and 100 jin of miscellaneous grains per mu -- is quite promising.

In fact, not to mention ordinary grassroots cadres, at the beginning of this year, even within the county party committee, opinions on this high-yield target were very inconsistent. Comrade Zhao Jiande, secretary of the county party committee, said: To discuss the target, three meetings were held in a row. The first meeting debated whether to set it at 830 jin or 850 jin. Those who advocated these two figures had their own reasons and their own calculations, and everyone was deadlocked. After the meeting, the county committee members went down to get a feel for the situation. Those who went to the harvest townships advocated setting the target higher. Those who went to the poor harvest townships said that it could not be set too high. The second meeting, after fierce debate, found that these ideas might be somewhat conservative, and it was decided to announce the target of 850 jin for everyone to discuss. As a result, the vast majority of cooperative members and grassroots cadres criticized the county party committee for being too conservative; the provincial party committee and the prefectural party committee also reminded the county party committee not to fall behind the situation. Under these circumstances, a third meeting was held, and it was decided to strive for the goal of a thousand-jin yield.

However, the county party committee's decision did not solve all the problems. Some county committee members were still doubtful about the possibility of a "thousand-jin county" for a long time. Comrade Yan Aoqiu, the county magistrate (standing committee member of the county party committee), said that he was one of the most stubborn doubters. This good comrade, who was born as a peasant, had farmed for a long time, and had done many odd jobs for others, finally dispelled his doubts and strengthened his confidence until he was selected to participate in the National Agricultural Labor Model Representative Conference, listened to many reports, and learned a lot of experience. He said that there were many people like him.

The National Agricultural Labor Model Representative Conference played a huge role in promoting the thousand-jin yield campaign in Liling. Comrade Zhao Jiande said that before this meeting, many cadres did not really see the favorable conditions for striving for a bumper harvest this year. After this meeting, everyone truly had "higher confidence and greater determination." At this time, the county party committee's thinking was completely unified, and then a county-wide meeting of agricultural cooperative directors was convened to further encourage everyone's enthusiasm and confidence, and then they went deep into mobilizing cooperative members to solve the ideological problems of the 10% of grassroots cadres and 20% of the masses. Many cooperative directors stated at the meeting: "Shave off these few long hairs and take a hoe to the fields." "Work hard now and go to Beijing in the autumn."

The county party committee saw that the cadres' thinking was gradually maturing, so it redeployed the leadership to eliminate the imbalance in production throughout the county. Last year, the drought in southeastern Liling was severe, with an average yield of more than 800 jin per mu, while the northwest only harvested more than 600 jin. As long as the northwest catches up with the southeast, and the southeast takes another step forward on the existing level, the "thousand-jin county" can be realized. Based on this requirement, the county party committee has designated more than a dozen members to be responsible for grassroots work in the northwest.

From before the formulation of the production plan to after the publication of the production plan, from lack of confidence to having confidence, from a small determination to a sufficient determination, it is necessary to go through a complex struggle and heavy work; and to truly achieve the bumper harvest plan of a thousand-jin county, there will definitely be more complex struggles and more heavy work ahead. Is this the case in Liling, and is it also the case in other places?

    定了计划只不过是斗争的开始
    本报湖南记者站
    在这春耕播种将要普遍开始的时候，多数县、乡已经制订或者修订了今年的农业生产计划，作为争取大丰收的具体目标。可是，订好了计划是不是就表示干部、社员已有足够的信心和决心来实现它呢？湖南醴陵县发生过的某些情况，说明并不完全是这个样子。
    醴陵是全国闻名的水稻丰产县之一。去年，全县六十多万农民战胜百年未有的严重旱灾，取得平均每亩收获七百一十斤稻谷的好成绩。今年，县委经过反复的调查研究，决心争取成为“千斤丰产县”。
    3月18日，我们邀请醴陵四个农业社主任开了个座谈会。这四个社去年都遭了旱灾，有的比1955年减产了，有的比1955年增产了。谈到今年的千斤丰产运动，我们问：“广大农民是不是都有信心实现呢？”他们分别计算过，说：“80％的人有信心，20％的人没有信心。”“这么多人没有信心，你们打算怎么办呢？”“这20％的人，多数是老弱孤寡户。只要干部积极起来，他们就会跟着走。”
    这话自然不错，群众总是看干部的。可是，基层干部是不是全有这种信心呢？从醴陵的情况看来，也还不见得。据说，大约还有10％左右的基层干部，和那20％的社员一样，想起去年的大旱灾，想起去年农业生产上发生的一些错误和缺点，就失掉了争取千斤丰产的信心。
    去年醴陵就提出了争取千斤丰产的口号，但是，没有实现。主要的原因是遇到了百年未有的大旱灾。老年人说：在湖南这地方，几辈子没见过夏、秋、冬三季都缺雨。结果，两万多亩稻田不能插秧，七万多亩晚稻因旱无收，十八万多亩晚稻因旱减产。这三个数字加起来，相当于全县耕地的五分之二。难怪有些干部说：“谁知道今年还旱不旱呀！”在农业技术措施上，去年也犯过一些错误。在90％的耕地上种了连作稻，多数增产了，少数因为土质、水利等条件不合适而减产了。盲目地推广了几千亩“青森五号”粳稻，也减产了不少稻谷……
    这些缺乏信心的干部只看到去年受灾和减产的一面，而没有看到另一个更重要的方面：虽然旱灾那样严重，全县的农业总产量还不少于大丰收的1955年；有75.1％的合作社增加生产，72％的社员增加收入；全县出现了一百五十四个千斤以上的社，四百二十七个八百斤以上的社，八百斤以下的只有二百零九个社。
    县委的看法和这些干部不同。县委不仅全面地分析了去年农业生产的成绩和缺点，而且足够地估计了今年争取千斤丰产的有利条件：一、去年合作社合并、升级和农业生产交叉进行，县委两个拳头打仗，领导力量不能集中；今年农业合作化问题基本上解决了，县委已能专心致力领导生产。二、领导机关和社员群众已经积累了一些在新情况下发展大生产的经验。比如：去年县委提出种植连作稻90％，事实证明多了一些；今年就提出种植60％到70％，还根据去年的经验，规定五种不适宜的田地不种连作稻。经过一年的实践，社员群众也开始掌握了种植连作稻、防治病虫害等等新技术。三、今年的水利条件比去年好得多。1955年风调雨顺，1956年春季修水利，简直不知道该在什么地方使劲儿。1956年大旱灾，暴露了抗旱能力薄弱的地方；今年的水利工作专在这些地方下工夫，前后共用三百万工，抗旱能力大为增强。四、今年的物质条件也比去年好。肥料增加了一倍到两倍。去年种籽、农具、耕畜是临时集起来的，数量不足，质量不高；加上一年的积累，这些东西比去年多也比去年整齐了。有了这些条件，只要不发生严重的自然灾害，争取“千斤丰产县”——亩产九百斤稻谷和一百斤杂粮——是有相当把握的。
    其实，不要说一般基层干部，在今年年初，就在县委内部，对这种高额丰产指标，意见也很不一致。县委书记赵健德同志说：为讨论指标，一连开过三次会。第一次会，争论的是究竟定八百三十斤，还是八百五十斤？主张这两个数字的人，各有各的根据，各有各的算法，大家相持不下。会议以后，县委们分头下去摸情况。到丰收乡去的，主张把指标定高些。到歉收乡去的，就说不能定得高了。第二次开会，经过激烈的争论，发现这些想法可能有些保守，还是决定和公布了八百五十斤的指标，让大家讨论。结果，广大社员群众和基层干部批评县委的指标太保守；省委、地委也提醒县委：不要落在形势的后边。在这种情况下开了第三次会，这才决定了争取千斤丰产的目标。
    但是，县委的决议没有解决全部问题。有些县委委员对“千斤县”的可能性，在很长时间内还是怀疑的。县长颜傲秋同志（县委常委）说，他就是若干个最顽强的怀疑者中间的一个。这个农民出身、长期耕田、给人家作过许多零工的好同志，直到被选参加全国农业劳动模范代表会议，听了许多报告，学了很多经验，才最后消除了疑虑，坚定了信心。他说，有不少人和他是一样的。
    全国农业劳动模范代表会议对醴陵的千斤丰产运动起了极大的推动作用。赵健德同志说，在这次会议以前，许多干部对今年争取丰收的有利条件，实际上是看得很不清楚的。经过这次会议，大家真正是“信心更高、决心更大”了。这时候，县委的思想完全统一起来，接着召开全县农业社主任会议，进一步鼓舞大家的热情和信心，再由他们深入发动社员群众，解决那10％的基层干部和20％的群众的思想问题。许多社主任在会上表示：“剃掉这几根长头发，拿个锄头到田里。”“现在好好干，秋后上北京。”
    县委看见干部思想逐渐成熟，就重新部署领导力量，以便消灭全县生产上的不平衡现象。去年醴陵东南部旱灾严重，平均每亩还收获八百多斤，西北部却仅仅收获六百多斤。只要使西北部赶上东南部，东南部再在现有水平上前进一步，“千斤县”就有实现的把握。根据这个要求，县委已经指定十几个委员，到西北部负责基点工作。
    从制订生产计划以前，到公布生产计划以后，由没有信心到有了信心，由较小的决心到足够的决心，要经过一番复杂的斗争和繁重的工作；而要真正实现千斤县的丰产计划，摆在前面的一定会有更复杂的斗争和更繁重的工作。醴陵如此，其他地方是不是也是这样？
