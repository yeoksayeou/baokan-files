Car Light Uproar
Zhang Tiesheng

    One Saturday evening, children were playing by the road.
    Suddenly, a gust of wind blew past them. Lin Xiaobao saw something and quickly shouted, "That bicycle doesn't have a light! Quick, chase it!"
    The children swarmed after the bicycle, shouting, "Hey, comrade! Turn on your light!"
    The bicycle ignored them completely. Lin Xiaobao became anxious and, as if giving a command, said, "Chase it from both sides!" The children immediately spread out. Finally, the bicycle was stopped. The cyclist, both angry and breathless, said to the children, "What are you doing, stopping people's bicycles?!"
    "Comrade, why didn't you turn on your light when riding at night?" Wang Yumin retorted.
    "I forgot to turn on the light, what's it to you?! You're not police officers..." the cyclist stubbornly argued.
    The children wouldn't let him go, but he insisted on leaving. Just at that critical moment, another child led a police officer over. The cyclist was criticized by the police officer, admitted his mistake, and walked away pushing his bicycle with his head down.
    The children looked around, and Lin Xiaobao was gone.
    After discussing it, they split up to search for Lin Xiaobao.
    Lin Xiaobao ran all the way to his front door and saw a bicycle leaning against the wall. He was about to go inside when he heard a "thump" from inside, followed by the sound of tea splashing on the table, accompanied by heavy breathing. Lin Xiaobao recognized it as his father slapping the table in anger.
    "Jinhua, what's wrong with you today?" This was his mother's voice. Lin Xiaobao hesitated for a moment and ran to his grandmother's room.
    Inside, Lin Jinhua took a few breaths and said to Xiaobao's mother, "Hmph! From now on, tell Xiaobao not to play with that group of kids, especially that one named Wang... Oh, Wang Yumin!"
    "Wang Yumin has been an excellent student every year, just like our Xiaobao. What's wrong with you today?!"
    After a while, Mrs. Lin noticed a shadow outside the door and hurried out to see what it was. It turned out to be Xiaobao staring at his father's bicycle.
    Mrs. Lin and Xiaobao went inside.
    Mrs. Lin looked at Lin Jinhua's angry expression and then glanced at Xiaobao. Her heart skipped a beat. Xiaobao's little eyes were filled with tears as he continued to look at his mother. Mrs. Lin quickly asked, "Xiaobao, tell Mom what's wrong." But Xiaobao couldn't say a word.
    Lin Jinhua snapped at the child, "Xiaobao! You can't play with that Wang Yumin anymore! Or I'll punish you!"
    Xiaobao opened his eyes wide, staring at his father's serious face. His little mouth twitched a few times, and he asked, "Dad, why?"
    "Don't ask so much! You have to listen to what I say!" Dad said sternly.
    Xiaobao's little chest immediately rose and fell rapidly, and his little face turned so pale.
    Mrs. Lin stood up and said, "It's baseless for you to say such a thing! Why are you treating the child like this!"
    Xiaobao finally spoke the words he had been holding back for so long:
    "Mom, I have to criticize Dad! Dad didn't turn on his light when he rode his bicycle at night. Wang Yumin and I and the other students chased him. When I almost caught up, I saw it was Dad. I was so ashamed, I hid. Some students scraped their hands chasing Dad, and I scraped my knee. Dad was wrong, the other students will laugh at me!" As he spoke, tears streamed down his face.
    "Oh, Xiaobao, you did the right thing, don't cry." Mrs. Lin quickly got some medicine to treat Xiaobao's wound.
    Lin Jinhua's heart was pounding like a drum. He frantically ran his hands through his hair. He looked at his child, then at himself, and his face immediately felt hot.
    The clock chimed "dong, dong." Lin Jinhua panicked, got out of bed, and was about to leave, saying he had to go to the club for a meeting!
    Lin Jinhua rode off on his bicycle. Mrs. Lin suddenly remembered something and clapped her hands, stomping her feet, and said, "Scatterbrain! He's going to run into a wall again!" She busily looked everywhere. Xiaobao stopped his mother and said, "Mom, what are you looking for?" Mrs. Lin said, "Your father's bicycle still doesn't have a light!"
    "Mom, don't worry. I put the bicycle light that Dad left in Grandma's room on Dad's bicycle."
    Mrs. Lin quickly held his little face and kissed him again and again.

    车灯风波
    张铁生
    星期六的傍晚，孩子们靠着公路玩。
    突然，一阵风从他面前刮过，林小宝一看，急忙喊：“那辆自行车没点车灯！快追！”
    孩子们一窝蜂跟着自行车后面追：“喂！同志！快点上灯！”
    那辆自行车全不理。林小宝急了，像下命令一样：“绕着路追！”孩子们一下就分散开。那自行车终于给拦住了。骑车的又气又喘，朝着孩子们说：“你们干什么拦住人家车子！”
    “同志，您晚上骑车为什么不点灯。”小王玉珉反问。
    “忘了点灯，又碍你们什么事？！你们又不是人民警察……”骑车的还强嘴。
    孩子们不许他走，他偏要走。正在这个紧急的时候，又一个孩子领着警察同志跑来了。这骑车的被警察同志批评了一顿，认了错，推着自行车低头走了。
    孩子们一看，林小宝不见了。
    大家商量了一下，分头到各处去寻找林小宝。
    林小宝一口气跑到家门口，看见一辆自行车靠墙根前放着。他刚要进屋，却听见屋里“嘭”的一声，接着是茶水溅在桌上的声音，和着粗声喘气，林小宝听出来是爸爸拍桌子，发脾气。
    “金华，今天你怎么啦？”这是妈妈的声音。林小宝迟疑了一下，跑到奶奶屋里去。
    屋里的林金华喘了一回，对小宝的妈妈说：“哼！以后少叫咱小宝跟那群孩子玩，尤其是那个叫王……噢，叫王玉珉的！”
    “王玉珉那孩子年年和咱们小宝是优等学生，你今天到底是怎么啦？！”
    过了会儿，林嫂子发现门外有人影子，忙走出去看，原来是小宝在望着爸爸的自行车。
    林嫂子和小宝进了屋子。
    林嫂子看看林金华的那副气冲冲的神气，转脸一瞧，心一阵猛跳；小宝的两只小眼睛含满了泪珠儿，仍然瞅着妈妈。林嫂子赶紧问：“小宝，有什么事儿就跟妈妈说。”可是小宝说不出一句话。
    林金华冲着孩子说：“小宝！下次不能和那个叫王玉珉的一起玩！不然的话，我可不饶你！”
    小宝睁大了眼睛，盯着爸爸那副严肃的面孔，小嘴动弹了几下，问：“爸爸，为什么呢？”
    “别的少问！我说的话你就要听！”爸爸狠狠的说。
    小宝的小胸脯立刻上下起伏不停，小脸变得那么难看。
    林嫂子站起身来，说：“你说出这种话来，真是没影子的事情！干什么这样对待孩子！”
    小宝这才说出半天要说的话：
  “妈妈，我得给爸爸提意见！爸爸晚上骑车不点车灯，我和王玉珉还有同学们追他，等快追上，我一看是爸爸，我羞臊得慌，就躲开了。为了追爸爸，有的同学把手都摔破了，我的腿膝盖也摔破了。爸爸太不对了，同学们多笑话我呀！”说着眼泪直流。
    “噢，小宝，你作得对，别哭。”林嫂子忙拿药水替小宝擦伤口。
    林金华心跳得像敲鼓一样，直用两只手乱抓头发，看看孩子，再看自己，脸上立即觉得发烧。
    座钟“当当”的响了，林金华慌慌张张，下了床就要走，说要到俱乐部开会去！
    林金华骑上自行车走远了，林嫂子猛然间想起了什么似的，一拍双手，跺着脚说：“慌张神！又该碰墙去了！”忙着东找西找，小宝拦住妈妈说：“妈妈，您找什么？”林嫂子说：“你爸爸的自行车还没有车灯呢！”
    “妈妈，您放心，我把爸爸扔在奶奶屋里的车灯装在爸爸的自行车上了。”
    林嫂子忙捧起小脸亲了又亲。
