　　Moscow, April 29 (By Our Correspondent) — The weather is warming up, people are changing into lighter clothing, and the street gardens and boulevards are already full of green leaves. The air of spring pervades Moscow.
　　Moscow is dressed in festive attire. From Red Square in the city center to the suburbs, it is covered with portraits of Lenin and Soviet Party and government leaders, red flags, and red banners. On the right side of the Foreign Ministry building on Smolensk Square, a large red banner reads: "To the great Chinese people – socialist builders – fraternal greetings!"
　　Construction workers and factory workers are competing to offer gifts for May Day. Many new buildings have been completed, especially in the emerging Southwest District. Trucks loaded with furniture are heading there, and many residents are moving into new homes. The "Red Proletarian" factory has exceeded its production target by 77 new-style lathes; the Three Hills Textile Factory wove extra planned cloth in the last four days of April; and the First Ball Bearing Factory saved a large amount of metal materials.
　　The shops are particularly lively. The State Department Store, the Central Department Store, food stores, and gift shops are crowded with customers: buying fruit and sweets, buying new clothes and shoes, buying watches and radios. The quantity and variety of goods in the stores have suddenly increased in order to meet the needs of residents during the holiday.
　　The telegraph office and hotels are busy. The telegraph office has received and sent hundreds of thousands of telegrams congratulating on the "May Day" International Labor Day these days. At the same time, tens of thousands of telegrams congratulating on "May Day" were sent to China, Egypt, Indonesia and other countries. The hotels welcomed trade union delegations from China, France, Hungary, Sudan, Indonesia, Japan, Finland and other countries.

    莫斯科五一前夕气象万千
    春天气息弥漫　到处红旗招展
    本报莫斯科29日电　天气暖和起来，人们换上轻便的衣裳，街心花园里和林荫道上已经是绿叶满枝，春天的气息弥漫着莫斯科。
    莫斯科披上了节日的盛装，从市中心红场到四郊，挂满列宁和苏联党政领导人的画像、红旗和红布标语。在斯摩棱斯克广场外交部大楼的右手，大幅红布上写着：“向伟大的中国人民——社会主义建设者致兄弟的敬礼！”
    建筑工人和工厂工人向“五一”节竞献礼物。许多新建筑物完工，尤其是在新兴的西南区。卡车满载家具奔向那里，许多居民搬进了新居，“红色无产者”工厂超额增产了七十七台新式旋床；三山纺织厂在4月的最后四天织的都是超计划的布匹；第一滚珠轴承工厂节约了大批金属材料。
    商店特别热闹，国家百货商场、中央百货商店、食品商店、礼品商店顾客盈门：买水果糖果的、买新衣新鞋的、买手表收音机的。商店里货物的数量和品种突然增多起来，以便在节日能够满足居民的需要。
    电报局和旅馆繁忙起来。电报局这些天收发了好几十万件祝贺
  “五一”国际劳动节的电报。同时，好几万件祝贺“五一”节的电报拍到中国、埃及、印度尼西亚和其他国家。旅馆迎接了从中国、法国、匈牙利、苏丹、印度尼西亚、日本、芬兰等国来的工会代表团。
