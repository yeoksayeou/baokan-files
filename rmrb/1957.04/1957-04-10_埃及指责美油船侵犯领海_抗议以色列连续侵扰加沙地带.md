Xinhua News Agency, April 9th: According to TASS, Cairo, April 8th: Egyptian sources, commenting on the "tentative" dispatch of an American oil tanker through the Egyptian territorial waters of the Gulf of Aqaba, pointed out that this is a violation of Egypt's rights.

These sources pointed out that there are currently no Egyptian armed forces in the Gulf of Aqaba through which the American oil tanker passed, and therefore Egypt cannot control this area of Egyptian territorial waters. The entrance to the Gulf of Aqaba is currently controlled by the United Nations Emergency Force.

"Egypt Financial Market News" wrote that the United States' dispatch of oil tankers through the Gulf of Aqaba is an attempt by the United States to prove that the Gulf of Aqaba has an "international nature," but everyone knows that the entrance to the Gulf of Aqaba is within Egyptian territorial waters.

The newspaper pointed out that Israel's acceptance of American oil tankers means that Israel's ambitions for the Gulf of Aqaba have the support of the United States.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, April 9th: According to the Middle East News Agency, the Egyptian Deputy Chairman of the Egyptian-Israeli Mixed Armistice Commission today submitted two protests to the Chairman of the Commission, protesting Israel's two incursions into the Gaza Strip.

An Israeli patrol crossed the armistice line east of the Gaza Strip on the morning of April 8th and abducted an Arab farmer working in the fields. On April 7th, an Israeli armed patrol also crossed the border into the northeastern part of the Gaza Strip and abducted an Arab.

On April 7th, the Egyptian side had also lodged a similar protest regarding the intrusion of Israeli armed personnel into Arab territory on April 1st.

According to the Middle East News Agency, United Nations Emergency Force Commander Burns sent a letter to the Israeli authorities on the afternoon of April 8th, asking them to pay attention to the fact that Israeli aircraft have repeatedly flown over the Gaza Strip in the past few days.

    埃及指责美油船侵犯领海
    抗议以色列连续侵扰加沙地带
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社开罗8日讯：埃及人士在评论美国“试探性”地派遣油船通过亚喀巴湾的埃及领海时指出，这是对埃及权利的侵犯。
    这些人士指出，在美国油船通过的亚喀巴湾目前没有埃及的武装部队，因此，埃及不能控制这个地区的属于埃及的领海。亚喀巴湾的入口处目前为联合国紧急部队所控制。
      “埃及金融市场报”写道，美国派遣油船通过亚喀巴湾是美国企图证明亚喀巴湾具有“国际性质”，但是，大家都知道，亚喀巴湾入口处是在埃及的领海之内。
    这家报纸指出，以色列接纳美国油船，就是以色列对亚喀巴湾的野心得到美国的支持。
    新华社开罗9日电　据中东通讯社报道，埃及和以色列混合停战委员会的埃及副主席今天向委员会主席提出两项抗议，抗议以色列两次侵扰加沙地带。
    以色列的一个巡逻兵在4月8日上午越过加沙地带东边的停战线，绑走在田地中耕作的一个阿拉伯农民。在4月7日也有一个以色列武装巡逻兵越境进入加沙地带东北部，绑走一个阿拉伯人。
    埃及方面在4月7日还曾经就以色列武装人员在4月1日潜入阿拉伯领土提出类似的抗议。
    据中东通讯社报道，联合国紧急部队司令伯恩斯4月8日下午曾经向以色列当局提出信件，要求他们注意以色列飞机在过去几天内屡次飞越加沙地带这样一个事实。
