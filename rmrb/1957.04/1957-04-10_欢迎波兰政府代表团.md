Welcoming the Polish Government Delegation
Huang Yanpei

    I.
    Dear Poland!
    Dear Polish Government Delegation!
    Welcome! Welcome!
    Every flower at the airport,
    Represents the smiles of the Chinese people.
    How fortunate! Both countries have today,
    The Chinese people will not forget the China of the past!
    Nor will the Polish people forget the Poland of the past!

    II.
    The China of the past,
    This Beijing city was once occupied by the Eight-Nation Alliance;
    The Poland of the past,
    Was also divided several times by powerful neighbors around that time.
    At that time,
    The nineteenth century had just passed,
    The twentieth century had just arrived,
    I was just a young student at university,
    China like this,
    Poland like this,
    The same humiliation, how serious!
    "Poland" was staged,
    Hatred! Endless hatred!
    What's the use of waving empty fists?
    Arise! Arise!
    Let us quickly awaken our own people.

    III.
    Today, the people of both countries have stood up.
    The people of both countries,
    After decades of arduous struggle,
    Millions of glorious sacrifices,
    The future of both countries has finally discovered infinite brightness.
    I, who have gone from youth to old age in this time,
    To commemorate the past shared experiences of the two countries;
    To celebrate the successive liberation of the two countries;
    To think about the common responsibility for world peace in the future,
    Through the visit of this delegation,
    My expectations will be particularly earnest:
    Between the two countries—
    Expand strength by strengthening friendship and unity;
    Further improve the living standards of each other's people through mutually beneficial material exchanges;
    Accelerate the economic and cultural construction of each other through mutual cooperation and exchange of experience,
    In this way, hand in hand, advance! Advance!
    Will surely more healthily and smoothly jointly embark on the great cause of socialist and communist prosperity and happiness.

    欢迎波兰政府代表团
    黄炎培
    一
    亲爱的波兰！
    亲爱的波兰政府代表团！
    欢迎！欢迎！
    飞机场每一朵鲜花，
    都代表着中国人民的笑颜。
    多么欣幸！两国都有了今天，
    中国的人民那会忘掉过去的中国！
    波兰的人民也那会忘掉过去的波兰！
    二
    过去的中国，
    这北京城曾经占驻着八国的联军；
    过去的波兰，
    也就在那时前后横被强邻几次瓜分。
    那时候，
    十九世纪才过去，
    二十世纪才到临，
    我个人刚在大学当一个青年学生，
    中国这样，
    波兰这样，
    同样地耻辱多么严重！
    “波兰”上演了，
    恨！说不尽的恨！
    挥舞着空拳有什么用？
    起来！起来！
    大家快快地唤醒那自己的人民大众。三
    到今天两国的人民都站起来了。
    两国的人民，
    经过了几十年艰苦斗争，
    千万人光荣牺牲，
    两国的前途终于发见了无限光明。
    这中间由青年而进入老年的我，
    为了追念两国过去共同的遭遇；
    为了庆幸两国先后获得了解放；
    为了想到今后对世界和平共同的责任，
    通过这回代表团的光临，
    我的期望将特别地殷勤：
    两国间——
    因加强友好与团结而把力量更扩大起来；
    因两利地物资不断交流而使彼此人民生活水平更提高起来；
    因互相合作、交流经验而使彼此经济建设、文化建设更快地增进起来，
    这样，手携着手前进！前进！
    定将更健康地更顺利地共同走上社会主
    义、共产主义繁荣幸福的伟大前程。
