    Porcelain Should Not Be Casually Decorated with Gold or Silver Trim

    At last year's National Ceramics Conference, the Ministry of Light Industry, in order to implement the state's spirit of saving gold, clearly pointed out that, with the exception of porcelain for overseas exhibitions, porcelain for export, and porcelain for ethnic minorities, porcelain sold on the domestic market should not be decorated with gold or silver trim under any circumstances. However, since the beginning of this year, the Jingdezhen Ceramics Wholesale Station of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives has told the units under its jurisdiction that produce porcelain: "Gold and silver trim must be added, otherwise it will not be purchased."

    According to our estimates, each twelve dan (a unit of dry measure) of porcelain requires at least one bottle of gold (or silver) solution, and each bottle of gold (or silver) solution requires one qian (a unit of weight) of gold (or silver). If 120,000 dan out of the 600,000 dan of porcelain sold domestically throughout the year are decorated with gold or silver trim, 16,000 bottles of gold and silver solution will be required, which is equivalent to a total of 1,600 taels (a unit of weight) of gold and silver. We hope that the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives will pay attention to this issue.

### 瓷器不应随便加金银边

    瓷器不应随便加金银边
    去年全国陶瓷会议上，轻工业部为贯彻国家节约使用黄金的精神，曾明确指出：除了出国展览瓷、外销瓷、少数民族用瓷外，国内市场上销出的瓷器，一律不得加金、银边。然而，今年以来，中华全国供销合作总社景德镇陶瓷批发站，对所属生产瓷器的单位说：“必须加金、银边，否则不予收购”。
    据我们估计：每十二担瓷器，至少需用金水（或银水）一瓶，每瓶金（银）水需金（银）一钱。如果全年内销瓷器六十万担中，有十二万担加了金、银边，需用去金、银水一万六千瓶，折合使用金、银共一千六百两。希望供销合作总社注意这个问题。　刘贤启　罗奎文
