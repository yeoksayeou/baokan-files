Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 7th—A state-of-the-art train power station designed and manufactured by Czechoslovakia for China has been installed at China's newly built train power industry base in Baoding City. As of 10:00 AM on the 6th, the train power station had been running for more than three days, and the situation is good. It will soon head to Sanmenxia to support the construction projects there.

This train power station consists of eleven carriages, with extremely complete equipment, and the entire production process is highly automated, with an hourly power generation of 2,500 kilowatt-hours.

This train power station arrived in Baoding on February 28th. Seven Czechoslovak experts who came with the train conducted dismantling and installation demonstrations in Baoding City. They taught the technical personnel of the Train Power Industry Bureau the technology related to the dismantling and installation operations of the train power station, piece by piece. In the first half of this year, Czechoslovakia will supply China with four train power stations that are exactly the same as this one, to support China's industrial production and industrial construction electricity needs.
