Xinhua News Agency, April 20th: The Conference of Directors of Provincial and Municipal Demobilization and Construction Committees, which concluded today, believes that the key to doing a good job in the placement of demobilized soldiers this year lies in the army's good educational work for demobilized soldiers and the local areas' good preparatory work.

The conference began on the 15th. In addition to summarizing the demobilization work of the past few years, the conference focused on discussing the placement of demobilized soldiers this year. The conference believes that after the demobilized soldiers return to their original counties and cities, the local Party and government leaders should introduce the local situation to them. In the placement work, all localities should mobilize the local masses to specifically help the demobilized soldiers solve problems such as housing and improve their production skills, so that they can settle down to agricultural production. It is also necessary to constantly pay attention to educating demobilized soldiers to unite well with grassroots cadres in the countryside and to have a correct attitude of humility, mutual learning, mutual assistance, and mutual respect. In addition, for demobilized soldiers placed in factories, mines, and other units, they should be assigned work in a timely manner, help them learn production techniques, and give full play to their enthusiasm.

Vice Premier of the State Council Peng Dehuai addressed the meeting today, focusing on the issue of understanding demobilization work. He said that demobilization work is a part of our country's entire socialist construction work, and demobilized soldiers are a valuable and active force in the country. Doing a good job in demobilization work is beneficial to both national defense construction and economic construction. He also said that in the future, a group of conscripts will be transferred from active service to the reserve every year. This shows that demobilization and retirement will become a regular task. Therefore, all localities are required to continuously strengthen their leadership over demobilization and resettlement work. The most important thing is to improve cadres' understanding of demobilization work and encourage them to actively do this work well.

Peng Dehuai finally said that the army also has a major responsibility for doing a good job in demobilization work. In the future, the army must resolutely implement the rule of "no departure without mature education" and earnestly do a good job in ideological education for demobilized soldiers. Military regions, military sub-districts, and all levels of conscription bureaus should actively assist local relevant authorities in doing a good job in demobilization and resettlement work.

    各省市转业建设委员会主任会议讨论安置复员军人问题
    军队做好教育工作　地方做好准备工作
    据新华社20日讯　在今天结束的各省、市转业建设委员会主任会议认为，作好今年复员军人安置工作的重要问题是在于军队方面对复员军人要做好教育工作，地方方面要做好准备工作。
    这次会议是在15日开始举行的。会议除总结了几年来的复员工作以外，着重地讨论了今年对复员军人的安置工作。会议认为，今年的复员军人回到原籍县、市以后，当地党、政领导方面要向他们介绍当地情况。各地在安置工作中要动员当地群众具体帮助复员军人解决住房等问题和提高他们的生产技术，使他们安于农业生产。还要经常注意教育复员军人同乡村基层干部团结好，使他们具有谦虚、互学、互助、互相尊重的正确态度。另外，对于安置在厂矿、企业等单位的复员军人，也要及时分配他们工作，帮助他们学习生产技术，发挥他们的积极性。
    国务院副总理彭德怀今天到会讲话，他着重地讲到了对复员工作的认识问题。他说，复员工作是我国整个社会主义建设工作中的一部分，复员军人是国家一批宝贵的积极力量。做好复员工作，既利于国防建设，又利于经济建设。他还说，以后每年将有一批义务兵由现役转入预备役。这就说明复员、退伍将成为一项经常工作。因此，要求各地经常地加强对复员安置工作的领导，最重要的是要提高干部对复员工作的认识，使干部积极做好这项工作。
    彭德怀最后说，军队方面对作好复员工作同样负有重大的责任。今后在军队方面，必须坚决执行“教育不成熟不走”的规定，切实作好对复员军人的思想教育工作。军区、军分区和各级兵役局要主动协助地方有关机关做好复员安置工作。
