Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 6th. The 4th Company's motor vehicle team of a certain motor vehicle regiment of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, on its recent mission to urgently transport supplies from Garmu to Lhasa, was trapped by a violent blizzard on the Tanggula Mountains at an altitude of more than 5,300 meters. All officers and soldiers of the motor vehicle team fought bravely against the blizzard for fourteen days and nights, finally escaping the danger and arriving safely in Lhasa.

When the motor vehicle team was trapped, the temperature on the Tanggula Mountains was around minus forty-seven degrees Celsius. In order to prevent the car engines from freezing, some officers and soldiers tore cotton from their clothes to light fires to warm the cars. Some officers and soldiers took off their overcoats to cover the supplies on the cars. Driver Wu Jinshan did not rest for two consecutive days and nights in order to warm the car. When platoon leader Xu Tianhua was repairing the car and saw that the oil line was blocked, he sucked the oil cup with his mouth, resulting in his lips freezing to the oil cup and tearing off a piece of skin. He did not eat for three days and nights, and hunger and cold made him faint. After regaining consciousness, he got up and continued to work. Under his leadership, no car in the entire platoon was damaged by freezing.

Many cars were trapped in the deep snow, so they used hemp ropes instead of iron ropes to pull them up. A car's rear wheel was hanging in the air and was about to fall off a cliff. The deputy instructor and everyone worked together to find a way to rescue the car. In order to start the car, new recruit Niu Yang'er spent the whole night boiling water. All officers and soldiers of the company spent fourteen days and nights filling their stomachs with dry food mixed with snow.

Because this motor vehicle team overcame the blizzard and ensured the safety of the vehicles and supplies, twenty-five outstanding individuals in the entire company were rewarded by the leadership, and five drivers gloriously joined the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League.

    唐古拉山出奇迹　英雄战胜暴风雪
    解放军某汽车队脱险抵拉萨
    新华社拉萨6日电　中国人民解放军某汽车团四连的车队，在最近从噶尔穆急运物资来拉萨途中，被狂风暴雪困在拔海五千三百多公尺的唐古拉山上。车队全体官兵同暴风雪进行了十四昼夜的顽强搏斗，终于脱离险境，安全到达拉萨。
    车队被困的时候，唐古拉山上的温度在零下四十七度左右。为了防止汽车引擎冻坏，有的官兵就扯下衣服上的棉花，点火烤车。有的官兵就脱下大衣来盖车上的物资。驾驶员吴金身为了烤汽车，一连两昼夜没有休息。排长徐天骅修理车时，见油路不通，就用嘴吸油杯，结果嘴唇冻住在油杯上，扯掉了一块皮。他三昼夜没有吃饭，饥寒使他晕倒了，苏醒以后他又爬起来坚持工作。在他的领导下，全排没有冻坏一辆汽车。
    许多汽车被深雪陷住，他们就用麻绳代替铁绳往上拖。一辆汽车后轮悬空就要翻下崖了，副指导员和大家一起想法把这辆车救了上来。为了发动汽车，新战士牛样儿用了一整夜的时间才把水烧开。全连官兵十四昼夜用雪拌着干粮充饥。
    由于这支车队战胜暴风雪，保证了汽车和物资的安全，全连有二十五名优秀分子受到了领导上的奖励，并且有五名驾驶员光荣地参加了共产党和青年团。
