Seven people won awards in the field of science. Corresponding Member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, physicist Yevgeny Zavoitsky, won the award for his discovery and research on the phenomenon of paramagnetic resonance. This discovery and research enabled scientists to further explore the crystal structure, the magnetic properties of molecules, ions, atoms, and atomic nuclei, and a series of extremely complex physical problems. Corresponding Member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, mathematician Pyotr Novikov, won the award for his theoretical work published in 1955. Soviet geologist Academician Nalivkin won the award for his academic leadership in compiling the Soviet map with a scale of 1:2,500,000. Biologist Academician Konstantin Skryabin won the award for his twelve-volume work on parasitology in the human and animal body. The late biologist V. Dogel won the award for his work on the simplest animal organisms. Georgian scientist G. Melikishvili won the award for his work on the ancient history of the peoples of the South Caucasus; Soviet Latin language expert Academician V. Shishmarev recently published works on the history of French and compiled valuable university reference books on this course, and also won the Lenin Prize.

Ten people won awards in the technology category. Among them, the famous aircraft designer Andrei Tupolev created the "Tu-104" fast jet airliner; Joint Institute for Nuclear Research Director D. Blokhintsev, together with a group of atomic technology experts, established the Soviet Union's first atomic power plant; optical instrument designer Bayoannisiani designed new optical tools; and medical scientist A. Bakulev invented a new surgical method for treating diseases of the heart and large blood vessels.

In addition, there were six collective awards in the technology section, including the experts who established a fully automated ball bearing production workshop at the Moscow First Ball Bearing Factory; and the experts who created and promoted electroslag welding in heavy machinery manufacturing (the names of the five winners in literature and art were published on page four of yesterday's newspaper).
