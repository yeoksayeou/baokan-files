    In the Sandys' Living Room
    Yuan Xianlu
    On April 9th, Sandys didn't return to his mansion until late. He had given a long speech in the House of Commons during the day on the 1957-1958 budget, and in the evening he rushed to the radio station to explain his budget to the listeners. Although Sandys was good at rhetoric, it was not easy to portray a budget that "greatly disappointed millions" as a good deed of the Conservative Party. Therefore, as soon as he entered his living room, he collapsed half-sitting and half-lying on the sofa without even taking off his coat, wanting to rest for a while.
    Waves of drowsiness attacked him. In a daze, he heard a few soft knocks on the door.
    "Come in!" he lazily replied.
    The door opened, and an old man in tattered clothes entered.
    "Who are you looking for? What are you doing here?" Sandys asked in surprise.
    "I'm here to find you, Mr. Chancellor of the Exchequer." The old man then explained his purpose: "I'm a person living on a pension, earning only two pounds a week. You know, Mr. Chancellor, prices are getting higher every day, and my life is getting harder and harder. You said on the radio that the government wants to help those who need help. Indeed, this year's budget has reduced taxes for the rich who earn more than two thousand pounds a year, but what help is there for us poor old people?"
    Sandys said, "Doesn't the budget stipulate that the tax-free allowance for the elderly should be increased?"
    "This only benefits those with higher incomes," the old man protested hesitantly, "But those who need the most help are us, millions of old people like me who only earn two pounds a week..."
    "I don't have time to talk to you anymore. Please go back!" Mr. Sandys interrupted the old man loudly, and pointed to the door with his hand. The old man helplessly retreated, muttering to himself, "What kind of world is this! Worked hard all my life; when my energy is exhausted, the country doesn't care whether I live or die..."
    Mr. Sandys angrily lay back down on the sofa. But, there was another burst of hurried knocking on the door.
    This time, two children came in, one in his teens and one not yet four years old.
    "Mr. Sandys, I want to ask you," the older child said with a pout, "Starting last week, the food in our school has increased from ten pence to one shilling per meal; and the welfare milk that my brother drinks has also increased from one and a half pence to four pence per pint. What's the reason for this?"
    "What do children know!" Sandys roared fiercely, "The country doesn't have that much money to subsidize you."
    The younger one was frightened by the Chancellor of the Exchequer's roar, but didn't dare to cry, and two teardrops were spinning in his eyes. The older one still tilted his head and asked, "Then, why does the government have money to make hydrogen bombs? That thing can't replace milk."
    "Don't make noise here, get out!" Sandys couldn't think of an answer for a moment, so he stomped his feet and drove the two children out.
    Not long after, someone knocked on the door again. A housewife came in.
    "Mr. Chancellor of the Exchequer, it's not easy to have a chance to tell you about my suffering. My husband is a metalworker, earning a little more than seven pounds a week. It's already very difficult to support a family of five with this money. Since last winter, the prices of everything we eat and use have been rising like a race. The first day you go to the grocery store and see something you like, and when you take the money to buy it the next day, hey, the price list has already been changed, and you don't have enough money. Take bread, for example..."
    "Madam, I don't have time to listen to you calculate household accounts," Sandys said impatiently.
    "Then, let me talk about paying taxes. Didn't you just announce today that you are going to reduce taxes for people who earn more than forty pounds a week? We have low incomes, but we pay a lot of taxes. Income tax, national insurance, purchase tax, local donations... I can't even count some of the items. Anyway, it's always more than three pounds a week..."
    Sandys couldn't listen anymore. He persuaded and pushed, finally getting the woman to leave his living room. But, a worker came to visit him again.
    "Mr. Sandys, this year's budget is too unreasonable." As soon as the worker entered the door, he loudly questioned, "You've only been the Chancellor of the Exchequer for a week, and you want the people of the whole country to tighten their belts. Now, you're taking the money squeezed out of us to feed the rich."
    "Who let you come here to make trouble." Sandys lost his temper. He slammed the luxurious mahogany table and roared, "Get out of here!"
    "I have to finish what I have to say." The worker said coldly, "You keep saying that Britain is a 'welfare state.' But, for whose welfare is it, after all? You invaded Egypt for the benefit of the capitalists, but you want us ordinary people to bear the losses. The workers don't live well, and when they ask to raise their wages a little, you help the bosses to reject the workers' demands; but you try every means to let their profits increase more and more. You also want to abolish the laws restricting rent, so that the landlords can squeeze two hundred million pounds more from six million households of tenants..."
    Sandys was so angry that he jumped up and down. He called the servants and pushed the worker out the door without saying a word.
    Less than five minutes after the living room door was closed, someone was knocking on the door again.
    "God! Why won't they let me have a moment of peace!" Sandys shouted hysterically. However, this time it wasn't some "idle person" who came in, but his superior—Macmillan.
    The Prime Minister looked at his cabinet member with surprise and asked, "What happened, Peter?"
    In that instant, Sandys' angry face had turned into a smile. He humbly asked the Prime Minister to sit down, and then told him in detail about what had just happened.
    After listening to Sandys' words, Macmillan smiled contemptuously and said, "It's not surprising that these people are not satisfied with the budget. There's no need to pay attention to them, just follow our established policy. The hydrogen bomb is the only hope to recover the prestige of the empire. As for those who earn more than two thousand pounds a year, that is the basic class we rely on in the election, and we must give them some benefits to stabilize them. This way our position will be stable."
    "Yes, yes!" Sandys repeatedly agreed.
    ...Macmillan didn't know when he left. There was only Sandys alone in the living room again, still lying half-sitting and half-lying on the sofa. He felt a little dizzy, like a dream and not a dream, and the Prime Minister's familiar voice still echoed in his ears: "This way, our position will be stable." At the same time, the shadows of the old man, the children, the housewife, and the worker appeared one after another before his eyes. They all seemed to be saying to him: "We still have to settle accounts with you."

    在桑尼克罗夫特的客厅里
    袁先禄
    4月9日那天，桑尼克罗夫特很晚才回到他的公馆。他白天在下院就1957—1958年度预算作了一个很长的发言，晚上又赶到广播电台为他的预算向听众作了许多解释。尽管桑尼克罗夫特擅长辞令，要把一个“使千百万人大大失望”的预算说成保守党的德政毕竟并不容易。因此，他一走进自己的客厅，连大衣都没有脱，就半坐半卧地倒在沙发上，想养息一下。
    一阵阵的瞌睡袭击着他。恍惚之中，他听到几下轻轻的敲门声。
    “进来！”他懒洋洋地随口答应。
    门开了，进来的是一个衣衫褴褛的老头。
    “你找谁？到这儿来干什么？”桑尼克罗夫特惊异地问。
    “我就是来找你的，财政大臣先生。”老头接着就说明了来意：“我是一个靠养老金生活的人，每个星期只收入两个英镑。你知道，财政大臣先生，物价一天比一天高，我的日子愈来愈难过下去了。你在广播里说，政府要帮助那些需要帮助的人。的确今年的预算使每年收入两千英镑以上的有钱人减了税，可是给我们这些可怜的老年人的是一些什么帮助呢？”
    桑尼克罗夫特说：“预算里规定要把老年人的所得税免税额提高，不是吗？”
    “这只对收入比较多的人有好处。”老头嚅嚅地抗议道：“但是，最需要帮助的却是我们，上百万个像我这样每星期收入只有两英镑的老年人……”
    “我没有工夫同你多讲。请回去吧！”桑尼克罗夫特先生大声打断了老头的话，并且用手向门口一指。老头无可奈何地退了出去，一面自言自语地嘟嚷道：“这是什么世道啊！辛辛苦苦干了一辈子活；等精力用尽了，国家就不管你死活了……”
    桑尼克罗夫特先生生气地重新躺倒在沙发上。但是，又响起了一阵急促的叩门声。
    这一回，进来的是两个孩子，一个有十几岁，一个还不到四岁。
    “桑尼克罗夫特先生，我要问问你。”那个大孩子嘟起嘴说：“上星期一起，我们学校里的伙食，每一餐从十便士涨价到一个先令；我弟弟喝的福利牛奶，每品脱也从一个半便士涨价到四便士。这是什么道理啊？”
    “小孩子懂得什么！”桑尼克罗夫特虎起脸喝道：“国家没有那末多的钱来补贴你们。”
    年岁小的那个被财政大臣先生这一喝给吓住了，然而又不敢哭，两颗泪珠在眼眶里直转。大的那个却仍然歪着头问：“那末，为什么政府倒有钱制造氢弹呢？那个东西又不能代替牛奶。”
    “不要在这里吵闹，出去！”桑尼克罗夫特一时想不出话来回答，就顿着脚把两个孩子轰出去了。
    没有多久，又有人打门了。进来的是一个家庭主妇。
    “财政大臣先生，好容易有机会向你诉诉我的苦。我丈夫是个五金工人，一个星期挣七镑多一些。靠这些钱来维持一个五口之家本来就很不容易了。去年冬天以来，吃的用的东西样样都像赛跑一样涨价。你第一天刚上杂货店看好了一样东西，等第二天拿着钱去买，嗨，价目单已经改过，带的钱又不够了。拿面包来说吧……。”
    “太太，我没有时间听你算家务账。”桑尼克罗夫特听得不耐烦了。
    “那末，我谈谈付税的事儿吧。你今天不是刚宣布要给一星期收入四十镑以上的人减税吗？我们收入少，税可交得不少。所得税，国民保险费，购买税，地方捐……有些名目我还数不清。反正，一个星期总得交上个三镑……。”
    桑尼克罗夫特再也听不下去了，他连劝带推，好容易使这个妇女离开了他的客厅。但是，一个工人又来拜访他了。
    “桑尼克罗夫特先生，今年的预算可太不合理了。”这个工人一进门，就大声质问道：“你当财政大臣刚一个星期，就要全国人民勒紧裤带。现在，你却把从我们身上挤出来的钱拿去喂富人了。”
    “谁让你到我这儿来胡闹的。”桑尼克罗夫特发脾气了。他使劲拍着豪华的红木桌子吼道：“给我出去！”
    “我得把话说完。”这个工人冷冷地说：“你们口口声声说英国是一个‘福利国家’。可是，究竟是为哪些人的福利呢？你们为了资本家的利益去侵略埃及，却要我们普通人来承担损失。工人生活过得不好，要求提高一点工资，你们帮助老板们来拒绝工人的要求；可是却想方设法要让他们的利润越来越多。你们还要废除限制房租的法案，使房主们能够从六百万户房客身上多榨两亿镑……。”
    桑尼克罗夫特气得直跳。他叫来佣人，不由分说就把这个工人推出了大门。
    客厅的门关上还不到五分钟，又有人在打门了。
    “天哪！为什么不让我有一会儿安静的时刻呀！”桑尼克罗夫特歇斯底里地叫喊起来。然而，这一次进来的却不是什么“闲人”，而是他的上司——麦克米伦。
    首相用惊讶的目光望着他的阁员，问道：“发生了什么事啊，彼得？”
    就在这片刻之间，桑尼克罗夫特的怒容已经变成了笑脸。他谦恭地请首相坐下来，然后把刚才发生的事源源本本地诉述了一番。
    麦克米伦听完桑尼克罗夫特的话，轻蔑地笑了一笑说：“这些人对预算不满意，这并不奇怪。用不着去理会他们，照着我们既定的方针办吧。氢弹是挽回帝国威望的唯一希望。至于每年收入两千镑以上的人，那是我们选举中所要依靠的基本阶层，必须得给些好处把他们稳住。这样我们的地位就稳了。”
    “是啊，是啊！”桑尼克罗夫特连声应诺。
    ……麦克米伦不知在什么时候离开了。客厅里又只有桑尼克罗夫特一个人，仍然半坐半卧地躺在沙发上。他感到有些迷迷糊糊，似梦非梦，耳边仍萦绕着首相的熟悉的声音：“这样，我们的地位就稳了。”同时，老头、孩子、家庭主妇和工人的影子，一个接着一个地浮现在眼前。他们似乎都在对他说：“我们还要找你算算账哩。”
