Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, 10th - Pakistani National Assembly members on April 9th fiercely criticized the U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan for interfering in Pakistan's internal affairs. The National Assembly has passed a resolution requesting the Privileges Committee to determine whether the U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan's speech in Quetta violated the privileges of National Assembly members.

In a speech on March 11th, U.S. Ambassador Horace Hildreth publicly attacked a Pakistani parliamentarian who spoke out against Pakistan forming an alliance with the United States during the last National Assembly session. This speech was considered interference in Pakistan's internal affairs and was criticized by political figures and newspapers here.

The motion regarding the privilege issue was proposed by independent parliamentarian Mian Iftikharuddin and has been passed in the National Assembly.

Prior to this, the National Assembly had engaged in heated debate. Muslim League parliamentarian Haroon said that the phenomenon of a foreign diplomat interfering in the internal affairs of other countries cannot be considered correct.

Iftikharuddin said that the U.S. Ambassador's speech mentioned precisely his own remarks. He said that Hildreth is accustomed to interfering in Pakistan's internal affairs. He pointed out that the U.S. Ambassador's remarks proved his point: the United States wants to control our country's domestic policies through the aid it gives us.

Foreign Minister Noon defended Hildreth, saying that the U.S. Ambassador had made great contributions to Pakistan. He said that the American people and government have been helping Pakistan. 40% of Pakistan's budget is provided by the United States. He also said that Iftikharuddin is a communist, and communism is a danger to freedom. The United States is trying to save the world from the harm of communism.

Noon's words were angrily refuted by Iftikharuddin, and the parliamentary order fell into chaos due to mutual shouting.

Iftikharuddin said that it was not only an offense to the National Assembly, but also an offense to Pakistan's national dignity. He said that due to accepting American aid, Pakistan has fallen into a state of suffering national humiliation.

Muslim League parliamentarian Rashidi supported Iftikharuddin's statement. He said that it doesn't matter who Hildreth attacks here. The fact is that Hildreth insulted Pakistan. Please don't start kicking and punching after you've delivered some grain.

The parliament finally agreed to refer the issue to the parliamentary privileges committee.

    给点粮食就想拳打脚踢
    美驻巴大使干涉内政激起公愤
    巴基斯坦议员对他进行猛烈抨击
    据新华社卡拉奇10日电　巴基斯坦国民议会议员在4月9日猛烈抨击美国驻巴基斯坦大使干涉巴基斯坦内政。国民议会已经通过决议，要求特权委员会决定美国驻巴基斯坦大使在基达发表的演说是否破坏了国民议会议员的特权。
    美国大使霍雷斯·希尔德莱斯在3月11日发表的演说中公开攻击巴基斯坦一位在国民议会上次会议上发言反对巴基斯坦同美国结成联盟的议员。这篇演说被认为是干涉巴基斯坦的内政，遭到这里政界人士和报纸的抨击。
    这个关于特权问题的动议是独立议员米安·伊夫蒂卡鲁丁提出的，并且已在国民议会中通过。
    在这以前，国民议会曾经展开激烈的辩论。穆斯林联盟议员哈龙说，一个外国外交官干涉其他国家内政的现象不能被认为是正确的。
    伊夫蒂卡鲁丁说，美国大使演说所提到的正是他的发言。他说，希尔德莱斯惯于干涉巴基斯坦的内政。他指出，美国大使的言论证明了他的这种论点：美国是要通过它给与我们的援助来控制我国的国内政策。
    外交部长努恩为希尔德莱斯辩护说，美国大使曾对巴基斯坦有过很大的贡献。他说，美国的人民和政府一直在帮助巴基斯坦。巴基斯坦的预算中40％的款项是美国提供的。他还说，伊夫蒂卡鲁丁是一个共产党人，而共产主义是危害自由的。美国正在设法拯救世界免受共产主义之害。
    努恩的话遭到伊夫蒂卡鲁丁的愤怒驳斥，由于双方互相叫嚷起来，议会秩序陷于混乱。
    伊夫蒂卡鲁丁说，它不仅是冒犯了国民议会，而且也冒犯了巴基斯坦的民族尊严。他说，由于接受美国援助，巴基斯坦已落到一种遭受民族侮辱的境地。
    穆斯林联盟议员拉希迪支持伊夫蒂卡鲁丁的发言。他说，希尔德莱斯攻击谁，在这儿是不关紧要的。事实是，希尔德莱斯侮辱了巴基斯坦。请不要运了粮食来之后就拳打脚踢起来。
    议会最后同意把这个问题提到议会特权委员会上去。
