Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, April 6th: Many graduating students from middle schools in Zhengzhou have expressed their willingness to return to the countryside after graduation to participate in production and become the first generation of cultured farmers in New China. In the past, due to the weakness of political and ideological work in schools, some students developed incorrect ideas of looking down on labor, especially agricultural labor and farmers. They believed that there was no future unless they went to college or became cadres after graduation. This semester, schools have universally organized seminars and discussions to address this thinking, and the thinking of the vast majority of students has improved, and they have initially established an overall concept and a correct attitude towards socialist labor. Many people have proposed that they are willing to return to the countryside to participate in production after graduation. They said: Everything must have a first generation; without the first generation of Communist Party members, there would be no happy life today; without the first generation of cultured farmers, the socialist agriculture of the motherland would not develop rapidly. 189 students from Zhengzhou No. 9 Junior High School wrote letters of determination, expressing that if they failed to get into school, they would resolutely be the first generation of cultured farmers. Many students have taken the initiative to write to their parents in the countryside to persuade them. Many students from the city have also said that if they cannot go to college, they will do whatever work is available.

    要做祖国第一代有文化的农民
    郑州许多中学应届毕业生愿回农村
    据新华社郑州6日电　郑州市有许多中等学校应届毕业生表示毕业后愿意回农村参加生产，当一个新中国第一代有文化的农民。过去由于学校政治思想工作薄弱，部分学生产生轻视劳动，特别是轻视农业劳动和农民等不正确的思想。认为毕业后只有升学或当干部才有前途。本学期，各校普遍针对这一思想组织了座谈和讨论，绝大多数学生的思想都有了提高，初步树立了整体观念和对待社会主义劳动的正确态度。很多人提出来在毕业后愿意回农村去参加生产。他们说：什么都要有第一代，没有第一代共产党员，就没有今天的幸福生活；没有第一代有文化的农民，祖国的社会主义农业就不会很快地发展。郑州市第九初中有一百八十九个学生写了决心书，表示如果考不上学校，就坚决作第一代有文化的农民。不少学生都主动地写信给在农村的家长，打通他们的思想。不少家在城市的学生，也表示如果升不上学，有什么工作就干什么工作。
