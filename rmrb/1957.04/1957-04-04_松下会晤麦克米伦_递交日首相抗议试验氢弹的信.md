Xinhua News Agency, London, 3rd - Matsushita Masatsune, the personal representative of Japanese Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke, visited British Prime Minister Macmillan on the evening of the 2nd and handed him a letter from the Japanese Prime Minister.

The content of the letter has not been made public. It is understood that Kishi Nobusuke emphasized in the letter that the prohibition of the manufacture and testing of nuclear weapons is the wish of all Japanese residents, and they earnestly hope that the British government can cooperate in this regard.

After meeting with Macmillan, Matsushita told reporters that Macmillan had promised to personally answer the letter in the next few days. He did not mention whether the meeting had any concrete results. According to the Associated Press, this new appeal from Japan has "little or no hope" of changing the British government's attitude of insisting on testing hydrogen bombs. Previously, Britain had repeatedly rejected Japan's appeals.

    松下会晤麦克米伦
    递交日首相抗议试验氢弹的信
    据新华社3日讯　伦敦消息：日本首相岸信介私人代表松下正寿2日晚拜访了英国首相麦克米伦，并且把日本首相的信件交给了他。
    信件内容没有公布。据悉，岸信介在信中强调指出，禁止制造和试验原子核武器是日本全体居民的愿望，他们都迫切希望英国政府能够在这方面进行合作。
    松下在同麦克米伦会晤以后对记者说，麦克米伦答应在以后几天内亲自回答这封信。他没有谈到这次会晤有没有具体结果。据美联社估计，日本这次新的呼吁“很少或者没有希望”会改变英国政府坚持试验氢弹的态度。在这以前，英国已经多次拒绝了日本的呼吁。
