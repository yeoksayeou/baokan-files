Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) invited the entire delegation from Guangxi Province to Beijing, Guangxi CPPCC members, relevant CPPCC members, and Guangxi figures working in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Changchun, and other places, totaling ninety-one people (eighty-two attended), from March 17th to 26th to discuss the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

Zhou Enlai, Chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, Vice-Chairmen Li Jishen, Li Weihan, Chen Shutong, Zhang Bojun, Burhan Shahidi (Uyghur), Zhang Zhiyi and Xie Fumin (Zhuang), Deputy Directors of the National People's Congress Ethnic Affairs Committee, Wang Feng, Liu Chun, Sa Kongliao (Mongolian), and Yang Jingren (Hui), Deputy Directors of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China, Lu Han (Yi), head of the CPPCC National Committee Ethnic Affairs Group, and deputy heads Pan Guangdan, Gan Chunlei (Hui), and Zaitao (Manchu) all participated in the meeting. Liu Geping (Hui), Chairman of the National People's Congress Ethnic Affairs Committee, was invited to attend but excused himself due to other commitments.

The meeting was presided over by Zhou Enlai, who also delivered a concluding speech at the end of the meeting.

The following spoke at the meeting: Li Weihan, Chen Zaili, Huang Shaohong, He Zijian, Pan Naide, Qin Yizhi, Wang Li, Wei Jichang, Chen Erdong, Zhao Keren, Zhang Xianlong, Lei Rongke, Liang Hulu, Chen Liangzuo, Yin Xi (female), Qin Zhenwu (Dong), Pan Zhuqi, Wang Peizhi, Chen Ruji, Tang Xianzhi, He Zhuguo, Huang Qihan, Chen Xiong, Feng Fushan (Yao), Li Dachao, Guan Ruiwu (female), Chen Qiufan (female), Lü Jiyi, Gan Huaiyi (Zhuang), Zhang Jingning, Yu Zuobai, Zhai Nianqu, Liang Shuming, Lei Peihong, Wei Ruilin (Zhuang), Xie Fumin (Zhuang), Pan Guangdan, Wu Keqing, Chen Cisheng, Peng Shizhen, Yang Taiyang, Xu Huigui (female), Wei Guanying, Mo Naiqun, Tang Youyan, Lin Kewu, Yang Yi, Xie Hechou (Zhuang), Shi Zhaotang, Qin Hui (Zhuang), Wang Yiren, Zhang Yunyi, Long Yifei, Liu Jia (Zhuang), Li Jishen, Zhou Enlai, and others, totaling fifty-six people.

In addition, Li Renren and Lin Hu, who were invited to attend but unable to do so due to illness, also expressed their opinions outside the meeting.

During the discussion, the vast majority of people advocated changing Guangxi Province into the "Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region," but a few individuals expressed different opinions, advocating that the establishment of Guangxi Province be retained. After repeated consultations, a consensus was reached on the necessity of establishing a provincial-level Zhuang autonomous area, and the vast majority of people believed that it was appropriate to change Guangxi Province into the Zhuang Autonomous Region. A few individuals still had different opinions on the name "Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region."

Prior to this meeting, the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the proposal of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, began to deliberate and discuss the establishment of the Zhuang Autonomous Region within and outside the Party in October 1956. In December of the same year, the third plenary session of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the CPPCC also took this issue as the main topic for discussion. The two plans under deliberation and discussion were: one plan was to change the entire Guangxi Province into the Zhuang Autonomous Region, which everyone called the "combined plan"; the other plan was to divide Guangxi into two parts, that is, to retain the establishment of Guangxi Province, governing the eastern part of Guangxi Province, accounting for about three-tenths of the province's area, and to separate the Zhuang-populated areas in the western part of Guangxi Province, accounting for about seven-tenths of the province's area, to establish the Zhuang Autonomous Region. Everyone called this plan the "divided plan."

This meeting conducted repeated discussions on the above two plans and related issues such as the name of the autonomous region. During the ten-day meeting, five plenary sessions and three group meetings were held. In the repeated consultations, the speeches were extremely widespread and enthusiastic. Among the eighty-two people present, fifty-six spoke at the plenary sessions, and more than ten of them spoke two to three times.

At the beginning of the meeting, Li Weihan, Vice-Chairman of the CPPCC National Committee and Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, spoke. He put forward "Some Views and Opinions on the Establishment of the Zhuang Autonomous Region."

Chen Zaili, Vice Governor of Guangxi Province and member of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, said: The western region of Guangxi, where the Zhuang people live, has a lower level of economic development, but Guangxi's rich mineral, forest, and other resources and wasteland are mainly in the west. Guangxi's railway, highway, and waterway transportation are also a whole. If they are separated, the development of the eastern and western parts will be restricted.

Liang Shuming, a member of the CPPCC National Committee, said: I agree with the "combined plan." Combining means not separating, and not separating is the spirit of Chinese culture. "One dispute, two ugliness; one concession, two gains" is the spirit of mutual concession. Today, we live in a big family of multi-ethnic friendship and should have this spirit. He said that this issue should be handled under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and through repeated consultations.

Lei Peihong, Vice-Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the CPPCC and Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Branch of the China Zhi Gong Party, said: Since we recognize the objective fact that the more than six and a half million Zhuang people in Guangxi are the most populous ethnic minority in our country, it is very necessary to establish a Zhuang Autonomous Region in Guangxi. My ancestors were originally from Qingzhou Prefecture, Shandong, and were sent to Guangxi during the Song Dynasty military campaign. Later, we settled in Nanning, which shows that ethnic oppression existed in history. Some people disagree with the term "repaying debts," but I think it can be used.

Chen Cisheng, Vice Governor of Guangxi Province and Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said: The combined plan is beneficial to ethnic unity and socialist construction. Building a big family of ethnic love and cooperation is our common goal, and the combined plan is in line with this goal.

Mo Naiqun, Vice Governor of Guangxi Province and Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, said: The combined plan is beneficial to ethnic unity, political influence, and economic construction. The Han people should take a proactive attitude to help the Zhuang people establish an autonomous region. If ethnic relations are handled according to the principle of "mutual assistance and common development" and other ethnic groups are taken care of in the nationalization of the autonomous organs in the future, the problem will not be too big. Even if some Han people in Guangxi may have concerns, as long as we do a good job in publicity and explanation, the concerns will be eliminated.

Shi Zhaotang, Vice-Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the CPPCC and Deputy Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, said: The Zhuang people must establish an autonomous region, and the autonomous region must be established in Guangxi. Separation is not good. The combined plan is not only conducive to socialist construction but can also eliminate the ethnic estrangement caused by long-term history. Regarding the name of the autonomous region, if the word "Zhuang" is not added, the Zhuang people will suspect whether it is a Zhuang autonomous region, and in fact, the Zhuang people will not agree.

Zhang Yunyi, member of the National Defense Committee and former First Secretary of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, said: I fully agree to change Guangxi Province into the Zhuang Autonomous Region, which is conducive to the economic and cultural development of the entire Guangxi Province. Regarding the name of the autonomous region, it is more appropriate to use "Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region."

Li Jishen, Vice-Chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, said: I advocate using the "combined plan." As for some Han comrades considering the feelings and habits of the Han people and advocating not using the name "Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region," I think this is unnecessary. The issue of feelings and habits should be elevated to the highest principle of building socialism, and it will be easy to solve. Li Jishen emphasized the necessity of the Han people, who are larger in number, to help the brotherly ethnic minorities, who are smaller in number, to achieve common development.

Gan Huaiyi (Zhuang), Qin Zhenwu (Dong), Feng Fushan (Yao), Wei Ruilin (Zhuang), and others from the Guangxi delegation all particularly emphasized the inseparable brotherhood between the various ethnic groups in Guangxi in their speeches. They expressed that as the younger brother ethnic minorities, they welcome the Han elder brother to join the Zhuang Autonomous Region.

Some individuals said in their speeches that Guangxi has been a province for more than 600 years, and the Han people are the majority in Guangxi. If Guangxi is changed into the "Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region," I am afraid that the Han people will find it difficult to accept emotionally and habitually, so they do not agree to adopt the combined plan. Some people agree to the combined plan, but disagree with using the name "Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region" and advocate using the names "Guangxi Province Zhuang Autonomous Region," "Guangxi Autonomous Region of All Ethnic Groups," or "Guangxi Autonomous Region."

At the plenary sessions and group meetings, the participants fully expressed their opinions. After repeated discussions and comparisons, everyone unanimously agreed to adopt the "combined plan." As for the name issue, the vast majority agreed to use the name "Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region," and only a few individuals still had different opinions. During the discussion, some people advocated raising this issue to the People's Congresses of several counties in Guangxi to solicit opinions. Li Renren, Vice Governor of Guangxi Province, and Lin Hu, Vice-Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the CPPCC, who did not attend the symposium due to illness, also expressed their opinions outside the meeting. Li Renren said: The relationship between the Han and Zhuang ethnic groups in Guangxi is harmonious, and it is better to combine than to separate. Some specific issues should be carefully addressed in the future. For example, representatives to the People's Congress should be elected according to the current election law. In schools where the Zhuang ethnic group is the main group, Zhuang language should be used for teaching, and in schools where the Han ethnic group is the main group, Han language should be used for teaching. In schools where both Zhuang and Han ethnic groups are present, Zhuang and Han languages should be used separately. Zhuang students should add Han language at a certain grade level in order to accept the cultural heritage of the motherland and modern scientific culture. Provincial-level cadres have a higher level and a better relationship, and it is easy to understand the issue of establishing an autonomous region. The cadres and the masses below are somewhat different, so it is necessary to vigorously publicize.

Lin Hu said: It is right for the Zhuang ethnic group to establish an autonomous region in Guangxi, and it is a right that the Zhuang ethnic group should enjoy. From the perspective of socialist construction, the development of ethnic minorities, and the interests of the Han people, it is better to change the entire province into an autonomous region. Separation is not good; separation weakens both sides, and combination strengthens both sides. Some people originally had different opinions on the name of the autonomous region, but after consideration, they believe that it is most appropriate to call it "Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region," which can best indicate the characteristics of the autonomous region.

Chairman Zhou Enlai said:
The Establishment of the Zhuang Autonomous Region is a Major Event
It Still Needs to be Discussed by the People of All Ethnic Groups in Guangxi

Chairman Zhou Enlai made a concluding speech at the end of the meeting. He said: This meeting has been very fruitful. We have heard opinions from all sides, and after discussion and consultation, everyone has reached a consensus on the major principle, that is, on the issue of establishing the Zhuang Autonomous Region, that combination is better than separation, which is a great success.

Chairman Zhou Enlai then talked about China's current ethnic policies from the perspective of ethnic relations in China's history. He pointed out that some ethnic minorities were gradually squeezed to the frontiers with the development of the Han people, which restricted their development. After liberation, we cannot but take this situation into account when implementing the policy of ethnic equality and unity. The Han people are in a dominant position in the country, so the Han people should think more about the ethnic minorities and not emphasize the ethnic feelings of the Han people as soon as the establishment of the Zhuang Autonomous Region is mentioned. The ethnic feelings of the Han people should be paid attention to, but feelings should be governed by thought and reason, and in our country, ethnic feelings should be combined with socialism. Han comrades should be strict with themselves and lenient with others and should think more about the benefits of ethnic minorities. We often say that our country is "vast in territory and abundant in resources, with a large population." The vast territory and abundant resources are all in the ethnic minority areas, and the Han people only account for the large population. In the future, the development of industry and the expansion of agriculture will mostly be in the ethnic minority areas. From the national perspective, "combination benefits both sides, and separation harms both sides," and the same is true in Guangxi Province.

Since the founding of the country, we have established the implementation of ethnic regional autonomy as the basic policy for solving ethnic problems in our country, which has been supported and supported by all ethnic minorities. This proves that this policy is completely suitable for the actual situation in our country.

Chairman Zhou Enlai said: It is okay to say that we are repaying debts to ethnic minorities. In China's history, there has been Han chauvinism. The Han people are in an advantageous position and have developed, while the ethnic minorities are in a disadvantageous position, are not easy to develop, and are often oppressed. Therefore, we should talk about repaying debts, and the Han people should help the ethnic minorities develop together. If we do not call it repaying debts, calling it "apologizing" is also acceptable. Some people think that mentioning repaying debts will affect ethnic relations and make them worse. In fact, it will not. Strictly criticizing oneself will not only not arouse the other party's resentment but will also cause the other party to examine their own shortcomings. Our past experience has proved this point. Does this mean that there is no local nationalism among ethnic minorities? Local nationalism also exists among ethnic minorities. We must first criticize Han chauvinism before we can arouse ethnic minorities to consciously criticize local nationalism. When Chairman Zhou Enlai talked about the population ratio between the Zhuang and Han ethnic groups in the establishment of the Zhuang Autonomous Region, he said: In our country, the Han people are large in number and have little land, while the ethnic minorities are small in number and have a lot of land. This disparity is a characteristic, so we must create some models so that the ethnic minorities feel that the Han people are willing to cooperate with them. In this regard, the transfer of Suiyuan to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is a good model, and Guangxi should also do the same.

Chairman Zhou Enlai finally pointed out: The establishment of the Zhuang Autonomous Region is a major event. Now it has only been discussed among upper-level people, which is not enough. This issue must be raised to the masses of all ethnic groups in Guangxi for discussion, not only in the Provincial People's Congress and the Provincial CPPCC but also in the County and City People's Congresses. It can also be discussed in districts and townships in some Han-populated areas. This meeting has affirmed the establishment of a Zhuang Autonomous Region equal to the provincial level and the "combined plan," so there is a direction for work. However, the name of the Zhuang Autonomous Region can be tentatively undecided. In addition to the "Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region" favored by the majority, if there is a better name, we should also consider it. In addition, we can also organize representative Guangxi people from all walks of life and people who care about this issue to visit Guangxi and participate in discussions. The Han people should help the Zhuang people in many ways to prepare for the establishment of the autonomous region, so that the establishment of the autonomous region can be achieved naturally.

After listening to Chairman Zhou Enlai's concluding speech, the people from all walks of life who attended the meeting discussed it and expressed their support and approval, and were willing to contribute their efforts to the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

    政协全国委员会邀请广西籍人士举行会议
    协商建立广西僮族自治区
    一致赞同建立省一级僮族自治地方和采用“合的方案”
    周恩来主席作总结发言，谈我国当前的民族政策
    新华社19日讯　中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会于3月17日到26日，邀请来京协商建立僮族自治区的广西省代表团全体人员，广西籍政协委员和有关的政协委员以及在北京、上海、广州、武汉、长春等地工作的广西籍人士共九十一人，到会的八十二人，就建立广西僮族自治区问题进行了协商和讨论。
    政协全国委员会主席周恩来，副主席李济深、李维汉、陈叔通、章伯钧、包尔汉（维吾尔），全国人民代表大会民族委员会副主任委员张执一、谢扶民（僮），中华人民共和国民族事务委员会副主任汪锋、刘春、萨空了（蒙）、杨静仁（回），政协全国委员会民族组组长卢汉（彝）、副组长潘光旦、甘春雷（回）、载涛（满）等都参加了这次会议。应邀参加会议的全国人民代表大会民族委员会主任委员刘格平（回）因事请假。
    会议由周恩来主持，并在会议结束的时候作了总结发言。
    在会上发言的有：李维汉、陈再励、黄绍竑、何自坚、潘乃德、覃异之、王力、魏继昌、陈迩冬、赵可任、张显龙、雷荣珂、梁岵庐、陈良佐、尹羲（女）、秦振武（侗）、盘珠祁、王培之、陈汝楫、唐现之、何柱国、黄启汉、陈雄、凤福山（瑶）、李达潮、关瑞梧（女）、陈秋帆（女）、吕集义、甘怀义（僮）、张景宁、俞作柏、翟念劬、梁漱溟、雷沛鸿、韦瑞霖（僮）、谢扶民（僮）、潘光旦、吴克清、陈此生、彭世桢、阳太阳、徐惠规（女）、韦冠英、莫乃群、汤有雁、林克武、杨义、谢鹤筹（僮）、石兆棠、覃辉（僮）、王以仁、张云逸、龙一飞、刘嘉（僮）、李济深、周恩来等五十六人。
    此外应邀出席而因病未能到会的李任仁、林虎也在会外表示了意见。
    在讨论过程中，绝大多数人主张把广西省改建为“广西僮族自治区”，但也有个别人士提出了不同的意见，主张仍旧保留广西省的建制。经过反复的协商，在必须建立省一级的僮族自治地方这个问题上取得了一致意见，并且绝大多数人认为把广西省改建为僮族自治区是适当的。个别人士对“广西僮族自治区”这个名称还有不同意见。
    在这次会议之前，中共广西省委员会根据中共中央的倡议，从1956年10月就开始在党内外酝酿讨论建立僮族自治区的问题；同年12月，政协广西省委员会第三次全体会议也把这个问题作为主要议题，进行了讨论。酝酿讨论中的两个方案：一个方案是把广西全省改建为僮族自治区，大家把这个方案称为“合的方案”；另一个方案是把广西划分为两部分，即保留广西省的建制，管辖现在广西省的东部，约占全省面积十分之三，另把现在广西省西部的僮族聚居地区约占全省面积十分之七划出来建立僮族自治区。大家把这个方案称为“分的方案”。
    这次会议就以上两个方案和自治区名称等有关问题，进行了反复的讨论。在经过十天会议的讨论中，举行了五次大会和三次小组会。在反复协商中，发言极为普遍、热烈，到会的八十二人中，在大会上发言的就有五十六人，其中有十余人作了两次到三次发言。
    会议开始的时候，政协全国委员会副主席、中共中央统一战线工作部部长李维汉发言。他提出了“关于建立僮族自治区问题的一些看法和意见”。
    广西省副省长、中共广西省委员会委员陈再励说：广西僮族聚居的西部地区，目前经济发展水平是低一些，但广西丰富的矿藏、森林等资源和荒地主要在西部，广西的铁路、公路、水运交通也是一个整体，如果分开来，东西两部的发展都要受到限制。
    政协全国委员会委员梁漱溟说：我赞成“合的方案”，合者为不分，不分，是中国文化的精神。“一争两丑，一让两有”，是互相谦让的精神。今天我们生活在多民族友爱的大家庭中，就应当有这种精神。他说要在中共领导下，经过反复协商来处理这个问题。
    政协广西省委员会副主席、中国致公党广西省支部主任委员雷沛鸿说：我们既然承认广西六百五十多万僮族人民是我国少数民族中人口最多的一个民族这个客观事实，那末，在广西建立僮族自治区就是十分必要的。我的祖先原先是山东青州府人，宋代用兵派到广西去，以后我们留居在南宁，这说明在历史上，民族压迫是存在的。有人不同意“还债”这个提法，我认为是可以这样提的。
    广西省副省长、中国国民党革命委员会广西省委员会主任委员陈此生说：合的方案对民族团结、对社会主义建设是有利的。建立各民族友爱合作的大家庭，是我们共同的目标，合的方案符合于这个目标。
    广西省副省长、中国民主同盟广西省委员会主任委员莫乃群说：合的方案，对民族团结、政治影响、经济建设都有好处。汉族人民应该采取主动态度帮助僮族人民建立自治区。如果按照“互相帮助，共同发展”的方针处理民族关系，并且在将来的自治机关民族化方面，照顾到其他民族，这样问题就不会大。即使广西的部分汉族群众可能有顾虑，只要我们作好宣传解释工作，顾虑也会消除。
    政协广西省委员会副主席、中国民主同盟广西省委员会副主任委员石兆棠说：僮族必须建立自治区，自治区也必须在广西建立。分开是不好的，合的方案不仅有利于社会主义建设，而且可以使长期历史造成的民族隔阂得到消除。关于自治区的名称问题，如果不冠上“僮族”二字，会使僮人怀疑是不是僮族自治区，这样事实上僮人是不会同意的。
    国防委员会委员、前中共广西省委员会第一书记张云逸说：我完全同意把广西省改建为僮族自治区，这样有利于广西全省经济、文化的发展。关于自治区的名称问题，以用“广西僮族自治区”比较适当。
    政协全国委员会副主席李济深说：我主张用“合的方案”。至于有些汉族同志考虑汉民族的感情习惯问题，主张不采用“广西僮族自治区”这个名称，我看这是不必要的。感情习惯问题应该提高到建设社会主义的最高原则上理解，这样就易于解决了。李济深着重地指出了人数较多的汉族应该帮助人数较少的兄弟民族求得共同发展的必要。
    广西代表团的甘怀义（僮）、秦振武（侗）、凤福山（瑶）、韦瑞霖（僮）等在发言中，都特别强调广西各民族间团结互助的不可分的兄弟关系。表示作为弟弟的少数民族，欢迎汉族老大哥参加到僮族自治区里边来。
    有个别人士在发言中说，广西建省已有六百多年，汉族在广西是多数，如果把广西改建为“广西僮族自治区”，恐怕汉人在感情上、习惯上难予接受，因而不同意采用合的方案。也有人同意合的方案，但是不同意采用“广西僮族自治区”这个名称，而主张采用“广西省僮族自治区”、“广西各族自治区”、“广西自治区”的名称。
    在大会、小会上，参加会议的人，都充分发表了自己的意见。经过反复讨论和比较，大家一致赞成采用“合的方案”。而对名称问题，绝大多数赞成采用“广西僮族自治区”的名称，只有个别人士还有不同意见。在讨论中，有人主张把这个问题提到广西若干县人民代表大会去征求意见。因病没有出席座谈会的广西省副省长李任仁、政协广西省委员会副主席林虎也在会外发表了意见。李任仁说：广西汉、僮两族关系融洽，宜合不宜分。有些具体问题，将来应该很好注意解决，例如人民代表大会的代表应该按现行选举法选出；学校教育在僮族为主的学校应该用僮文教学，汉族为主的学校应该用汉文教学，僮、汉同校的分别用僮、汉文教学。僮族学生到一定学级应该增学汉文，以便接受祖国的文化遗产和近代的科学文化。省级干部水平较高，关系较好，对建立自治区问题容易了解，下边干部和群众有所不同，所以必须大力宣传。
    林虎说：僮族在广西建立自治区是应该的，是僮族应该享有的权利。从社会主义建设、少数民族发展以及汉族人民的利益看，全省改建为自治区较好，分开不好，分则两弱，合则两强。自治区的名称原来有些人是有不同意见的，现在经过考虑，认为叫做“广西僮族自治区”最能表明自治区的特点。周恩来主席说：
    成立僮族自治区是大事
    还要由广西各族人民讨论
    周恩来主席在会议结束时作了总结发言。他说：这次会议的收获很大，听到了各方面的意见，经过讨论协商，大家在大的原则上，即在建立僮族自治区问题上，合比分好的问题上取得了一致意见，这就是很大的成功。
    周恩来主席接着从我国历史上的民族关系谈到我国当前的民族政策。他指出，有些少数民族是随着汉族的发展，后来逐渐被挤到边疆去了，使他们的发展受到了限制。解放以后，我们实行民族平等团结政策就不能不照顾到这种情况。汉族在全国居于优势地位，因此汉族要多替少数民族着想，不要一谈到建立僮族自治区，就强调汉族的民族感情。汉族的民族感情是要注意的，但是感情要受思想和理智的支配，在我国民族感情应当同社会主义结合起来。汉族同志要严于责己，宽于责人，要多想到少数民族的好处。平常我们常说的我国“地大物博，人口众多”，地大物博都在少数民族地区，汉族只占人多一条。将来发展工业，扩大农业、大部分将在少数民族地区。从全国看来，“合则两利，分则两害”，在广西省说来也是这样。
    我国从建国开始，就确定了以实行民族区域自治为解决我国民族问题的基本政策，它得到了各少数民族的拥护和支持。这证明这个政策是完全适合于我国的实际情况的。
    周恩来主席说：向少数民族还债的说法是可以说的。在我国历史上事实存在着大汉族主义，汉族处于优势，得到了发展，少数民族处于劣势，不易得到发展，而且常受欺压，所以应该讲还债，汉族应该帮助少数民族共同发展。如果不叫还债，叫做“陪不是”也可以。有些人认为提还债，怕影响民族关系搞不好，事实上是不会的。严格批评自己，不但不会引起对方的反感，反而会引起对方检查自己的缺点。我们历来的经验都证明了这一点。这样讲是否就是说在少数民族中不存在地方民族主义呢？在少数民族中也是存在着地方民族主义的，我们首先批判了大汉族主义，才能引起少数民族自觉地来批判地方民族主义。周恩来主席在谈到建立僮族自治区当中的僮、汉两个民族间的人口比例问题的时候说：在我国，汉族人多地少，少数民族人少地多，这种悬殊的情况是一个特点，因而要创造一些范例，使少数民族感到汉族是愿意同他们合作的。在这方面，绥远划归内蒙古自治区是一个好的范例，广西也应当这样作。
    周恩来主席最后指出：成立僮族自治区是一件大事，现在只是在上层人士当中作了讨论，这是不够的，要把这个问题提到广西各族人民群众中去讨论，不仅在省人民代表大会、省政协展开讨论，也要提到县、市人民代表大会去讨论，还可以在若干汉族聚居区的区、乡进行讨论。这次会议肯定了成立等于省级的僮族自治区和“合的方案”，这样就有了工作方向。但是僮族自治区的名称可暂不肯定，除了大多数人赞成的“广西僮族自治区”以外，如果还有更好的名称，我们还应该加以考虑。此外，还可以组织各方面有代表性的广西籍人士和关心这个问题的人士去广西参观和参加讨论。汉族人民应该从多方面帮助僮族进行筹备成立自治区的工作，使自治区的建立作到瓜熟蒂落，水到渠成。
    到会的各方面人士在听了周恩来主席的总结发言以后，进行了讨论，并且都表示拥护和赞同，愿意为建立广西僮族自治区而贡献自己的力量。（附图片）
