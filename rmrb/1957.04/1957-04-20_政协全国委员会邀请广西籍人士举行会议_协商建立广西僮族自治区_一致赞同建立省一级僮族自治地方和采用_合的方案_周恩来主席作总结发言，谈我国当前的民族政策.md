Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) invited the entire delegation from Guangxi Province to Beijing, Guangxi CPPCC members, relevant CPPCC members, and Guangxi figures working in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Changchun, and other places, totaling ninety-one people (eighty-two attended), from March 17th to 26th to discuss the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

Zhou Enlai, Chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, Vice-Chairmen Li Jishen, Li Weihan, Chen Shutong, Zhang Bojun, Burhan Shahidi (Uyghur), Zhang Zhiyi and Xie Fumin (Zhuang), Deputy Directors of the National People's Congress Ethnic Affairs Committee, Wang Feng, Liu Chun, Sa Kongliao (Mongolian), and Yang Jingren (Hui), Deputy Directors of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China, Lu Han (Yi), head of the CPPCC National Committee Ethnic Affairs Group, and deputy heads Pan Guangdan, Gan Chunlei (Hui), and Zaitao (Manchu) all participated in the meeting. Liu Geping (Hui), Chairman of the National People's Congress Ethnic Affairs Committee, was invited to attend but excused himself due to other commitments.

The meeting was presided over by Zhou Enlai, who also delivered a concluding speech at the end of the meeting.

The following spoke at the meeting: Li Weihan, Chen Zaili, Huang Shaohong, He Zijian, Pan Naide, Qin Yizhi, Wang Li, Wei Jichang, Chen Erdong, Zhao Keren, Zhang Xianlong, Lei Rongke, Liang Hulu, Chen Liangzuo, Yin Xi (female), Qin Zhenwu (Dong), Pan Zhuqi, Wang Peizhi, Chen Ruji, Tang Xianzhi, He Zhuguo, Huang Qihan, Chen Xiong, Feng Fushan (Yao), Li Dachao, Guan Ruiwu (female), Chen Qiufan (female), LÃ¼ Jiyi, Gan Huaiyi (Zhuang), Zhang Jingning, Yu Zuobai, Zhai Nianqu, Liang Shuming, Lei Peihong, Wei Ruilin (Zhuang), Xie Fumin (Zhuang), Pan Guangdan, Wu Keqing, Chen Cisheng, Peng Shizhen, Yang Taiyang, Xu Huigui (female), Wei Guanying, Mo Naiqun, Tang Youyan, Lin Kewu, Yang Yi, Xie Hechou (Zhuang), Shi Zhaotang, Qin Hui (Zhuang), Wang Yiren, Zhang Yunyi, Long Yifei, Liu Jia (Zhuang), Li Jishen, Zhou Enlai, and others, totaling fifty-six people.

In addition, Li Renren and Lin Hu, who were invited to attend but unable to do so due to illness, also expressed their opinions outside the meeting.

During the discussion, the vast majority of people advocated changing Guangxi Province into the "Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region," but a few individuals expressed different opinions, advocating that the establishment of Guangxi Province be retained. After repeated consultations, a consensus was reached on the necessity of establishing a provincial-level Zhuang autonomous area, and the vast majority of people believed that it was appropriate to change Guangxi Province into the Zhuang Autonomous Region. A few individuals still had different opinions on the name "Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region."

Prior to this meeting, the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, based on the proposal of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, began to deliberate and discuss the establishment of the Zhuang Autonomous Region within and outside the Party in October 1956. In December of the same year, the third plenary session of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the CPPCC also took this issue as the main topic for discussion. The two plans under deliberation and discussion were: one plan was to change the entire Guangxi Province into the Zhuang Autonomous Region, which everyone called the "combined plan"; the other plan was to divide Guangxi into two parts, that is, to retain the establishment of Guangxi Province, governing the eastern part of Guangxi Province, accounting for about three-tenths of the province's area, and to separate the Zhuang-populated areas in the western part of Guangxi Province, accounting for about seven-tenths of the province's area, to establish the Zhuang Autonomous Region. Everyone called this plan the "divided plan."

This meeting conducted repeated discussions on the above two plans and related issues such as the name of the autonomous region. During the ten-day meeting, five plenary sessions and three group meetings were held. In the repeated consultations, the speeches were extremely widespread and enthusiastic. Among the eighty-two people present, fifty-six spoke at the plenary sessions, and more than ten of them spoke two to three times.

At the beginning of the meeting, Li Weihan, Vice-Chairman of the CPPCC National Committee and Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, spoke. He put forward "Some Views and Opinions on the Establishment of the Zhuang Autonomous Region."

Chen Zaili, Vice Governor of Guangxi Province and member of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, said: The western region of Guangxi, where the Zhuang people live, has a lower level of economic development, but Guangxi's rich mineral, forest, and other resources and wasteland are mainly in the west. Guangxi's railway, highway, and waterway transportation are also a whole. If they are separated, the development of the eastern and western parts will be restricted.

Liang Shuming, a member of the CPPCC National Committee, said: I agree with the "combined plan." Combining means not separating, and not separating is the spirit of Chinese culture. "One dispute, two ugliness; one concession, two gains" is the spirit of mutual concession. Today, we live in a big family of multi-ethnic friendship and should have this spirit. He said that this issue should be handled under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and through repeated consultations.

Lei Peihong, Vice-Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the CPPCC and Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Branch of the China Zhi Gong Party, said: Since we recognize the objective fact that the more than six and a half million Zhuang people in Guangxi are the most populous ethnic minority in our country, it is very necessary to establish a Zhuang Autonomous Region in Guangxi. My ancestors were originally from Qingzhou Prefecture, Shandong, and were sent to Guangxi during the Song Dynasty military campaign. Later, we settled in Nanning, which shows that ethnic oppression existed in history. Some people disagree with the term "repaying debts," but I think it can be used.

Chen Cisheng, Vice Governor of Guangxi Province and Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said: The combined plan is beneficial to ethnic unity and socialist construction. Building a big family of ethnic love and cooperation is our common goal, and the combined plan is in line with this goal.

Mo Naiqun, Vice Governor of Guangxi Province and Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, said: The combined plan is beneficial to ethnic unity, political influence, and economic construction. The Han people should take a proactive attitude to help the Zhuang people establish an autonomous region. If ethnic relations are handled according to the principle of "mutual assistance and common development" and other ethnic groups are taken care of in the nationalization of the autonomous organs in the future, the problem will not be too big. Even if some Han people in Guangxi may have concerns, as long as we do a good job in publicity and explanation, the concerns will be eliminated.

Shi Zhaotang, Vice-Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the CPPCC and Deputy Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, said: The Zhuang people must establish an autonomous region, and the autonomous region must be established in Guangxi. Separation is not good. The combined plan is not only conducive to socialist construction but can also eliminate the ethnic estrangement caused by long-term history. Regarding the name of the autonomous region, if the word "Zhuang" is not added, the Zhuang people will suspect whether it is a Zhuang autonomous region, and in fact, the Zhuang people will not agree.

Zhang Yunyi, member of the National Defense Committee and former First Secretary of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, said: I fully agree to change Guangxi Province into the Zhuang Autonomous Region, which is conducive to the economic and cultural development of the entire Guangxi Province. Regarding the name of the autonomous region, it is more appropriate to use "Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region."

Li Jishen, Vice-Chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, said: I advocate using the "combined plan." As for some Han comrades considering the feelings and habits of the Han people and advocating not using the name "Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region," I think this is unnecessary. The issue of feelings and habits should be elevated to the highest principle of building socialism, and it will be easy to solve. Li Jishen emphasized the necessity of the Han people, who are larger in number, to help the brotherly ethnic minorities, who are smaller in number, to achieve common development.

Gan Huaiyi (Zhuang), Qin Zhenwu (Dong), Feng Fushan (Yao), Wei Ruilin (Zhuang), and others from the Guangxi delegation all particularly emphasized the inseparable brotherhood between the various ethnic groups in Guangxi in their speeches. They expressed that as the younger brother ethnic minorities, they welcome the Han elder brother to join the Zhuang Autonomous Region.

Some individuals said in their speeches that Guangxi has been a province for more than 600 years, and the Han people are the majority in Guangxi. If Guangxi is changed into the "Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region," I am afraid that the Han people will find it difficult to accept emotionally and habitually, so they do not agree to adopt the combined plan. Some people agree to the combined plan, but disagree with using the name "Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region" and advocate using the names "Guangxi Province Zhuang Autonomous Region," "Guangxi Autonomous Region of All Ethnic Groups," or "Guangxi Autonomous Region."

At the plenary sessions and group meetings, the participants fully expressed their opinions. After repeated discussions and comparisons, everyone unanimously agreed to adopt the "combined plan." As for the name issue, the vast majority agreed to use the name "Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region," and only a few individuals still had different opinions. During the discussion, some people advocated raising this issue to the People's Congresses of several counties in Guangxi to solicit opinions. Li Renren, Vice Governor of Guangxi Province, and Lin Hu, Vice-Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the CPPCC, who did not attend the symposium due to illness, also expressed their opinions outside the meeting. Li Renren said: The relationship between the Han and Zhuang ethnic groups in Guangxi is harmonious, and it is better to combine than to separate. Some specific issues should be carefully addressed in the future. For example, representatives to the People's Congress should be elected according to the current election law. In schools where the Zhuang ethnic group is the main group, Zhuang language should be used for teaching, and in schools where the Han ethnic group is the main group, Han language should be used for teaching. In schools where both Zhuang and Han ethnic groups are present, Zhuang and Han languages should be used separately. Zhuang students should add Han language at a certain grade level in order to accept the cultural heritage of the motherland and modern scientific culture. Provincial-level cadres have a higher level and a better relationship, and it is easy to understand the issue of establishing an autonomous region. The cadres and the masses below are somewhat different, so it is necessary to vigorously publicize.

Lin Hu said: It is right for the Zhuang ethnic group to establish an autonomous region in Guangxi, and it is a right that the Zhuang ethnic group should enjoy. From the perspective of socialist construction, the development of ethnic minorities, and the interests of the Han people, it is better to change the entire province into an autonomous region. Separation is not good; separation weakens both sides, and combination strengthens both sides. Some people originally had different opinions on the name of the autonomous region, but after consideration, they believe that it is most appropriate to call it "Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region," which can best indicate the characteristics of the autonomous region.

Chairman Zhou Enlai said:
The Establishment of the Zhuang Autonomous Region is a Major Event
It Still Needs to be Discussed by the People of All Ethnic Groups in Guangxi

Chairman Zhou Enlai made a concluding speech at the end of the meeting. He said: This meeting has been very fruitful. We have heard opinions from all sides, and after discussion and consultation, everyone has reached a consensus on the major principle, that is, on the issue of establishing the Zhuang Autonomous Region, that combination is better than separation, which is a great success.

Chairman Zhou Enlai then talked about China's current ethnic policies from the perspective of ethnic relations in China's history. He pointed out that some ethnic minorities were gradually squeezed to the frontiers with the development of the Han people, which restricted their development. After liberation, we cannot but take this situation into account when implementing the policy of ethnic equality and unity. The Han people are in a dominant position in the country, so the Han people should think more about the ethnic minorities and not emphasize the ethnic feelings of the Han people as soon as the establishment of the Zhuang Autonomous Region is mentioned. The ethnic feelings of the Han people should be paid attention to, but feelings should be governed by thought and reason, and in our country, ethnic feelings should be combined with socialism. Han comrades should be strict with themselves and lenient with others and should think more about the benefits of ethnic minorities. We often say that our country is "vast in territory and abundant in resources, with a large population." The vast territory and abundant resources are all in the ethnic minority areas, and the Han people only account for the large population. In the future, the development of industry and the expansion of agriculture will mostly be in the ethnic minority areas. From the national perspective, "combination benefits both sides, and separation harms both sides," and the same is true in Guangxi Province.

Since the founding of the country, we have established the implementation of ethnic regional autonomy as the basic policy for solving ethnic problems in our country, which has been supported and supported by all ethnic minorities. This proves that this policy is completely suitable for the actual situation in our country.

Chairman Zhou Enlai said: It is okay to say that we are repaying debts to ethnic minorities. In China's history, there has been Han chauvinism. The Han people are in an advantageous position and have developed, while the ethnic minorities are in a disadvantageous position, are not easy to develop, and are often oppressed. Therefore, we should talk about repaying debts, and the Han people should help the ethnic minorities develop together. If we do not call it repaying debts, calling it "apologizing" is also acceptable. Some people think that mentioning repaying debts will affect ethnic relations and make them worse. In fact, it will not. Strictly criticizing oneself will not only not arouse the other party's resentment but will also cause the other party to examine their own shortcomings. Our past experience has proved this point. Does this mean that there is no local nationalism among ethnic minorities? Local nationalism also exists among ethnic minorities. We must first criticize Han chauvinism before we can arouse ethnic minorities to consciously criticize local nationalism. When Chairman Zhou Enlai talked about the population ratio between the Zhuang and Han ethnic groups in the establishment of the Zhuang Autonomous Region, he said: In our country, the Han people are large in number and have little land, while the ethnic minorities are small in number and have a lot of land. This disparity is a characteristic, so we must create some models so that the ethnic minorities feel that the Han people are willing to cooperate with them. In this regard, the transfer of Suiyuan to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is a good model, and Guangxi should also do the same.

Chairman Zhou Enlai finally pointed out: The establishment of the Zhuang Autonomous Region is a major event. Now it has only been discussed among upper-level people, which is not enough. This issue must be raised to the masses of all ethnic groups in Guangxi for discussion, not only in the Provincial People's Congress and the Provincial CPPCC but also in the County and City People's Congresses. It can also be discussed in districts and townships in some Han-populated areas. This meeting has affirmed the establishment of a Zhuang Autonomous Region equal to the provincial level and the "combined plan," so there is a direction for work. However, the name of the Zhuang Autonomous Region can be tentatively undecided. In addition to the "Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region" favored by the majority, if there is a better name, we should also consider it. In addition, we can also organize representative Guangxi people from all walks of life and people who care about this issue to visit Guangxi and participate in discussions. The Han people should help the Zhuang people in many ways to prepare for the establishment of the autonomous region, so that the establishment of the autonomous region can be achieved naturally.

After listening to Chairman Zhou Enlai's concluding speech, the people from all walks of life who attended the meeting discussed it and expressed their support and approval, and were willing to contribute their efforts to the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
