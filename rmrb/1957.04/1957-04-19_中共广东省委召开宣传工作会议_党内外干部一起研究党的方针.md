    CCP Guangdong Provincial Committee Holds Propaganda Work Conference
    Party and Non-Party Cadres Jointly Study the Party's Policies
    (Our dispatch from Guangzhou) The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently convened a propaganda work conference.
    The representatives attending the meeting all had a fresh impression: Party and non-Party cadres meeting together to study the Party's policies, this is a first for Guangdong. Liang Ruochen, Deputy Director of the Guangzhou Municipal Bureau of Culture and member of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, said: In the past, the implementation of policies was first within the Party and then outside the Party, and many non-Party individuals had a sense of inferiority, feeling that they were inferior to others, and their work was not active enough; this meeting brought together Party and non-Party cadres to discuss the Party's policies, which enhanced the confidence of non-Party cadres in their work, and also made Party cadres more aware that implementing the Party's policies must be done in conjunction with non-Party cadres, treating non-Party comrades equally. He hopes that in the future, all departments, counties, and cities will be able to hold more meetings of this kind. After studying Chairman Mao's speech, the representatives felt as if they were bathed in a spring breeze, and their minds were broadened.
    After studying and discussing Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference and his instructions at the National Propaganda Work Conference, the representatives felt as if they were bathed in a spring breeze, and their minds were broadened, and their thinking was liberated once again. Zhou Shoukai, Vice President of Guangzhou Zhongshan Medical College, said: The era has undergone a great transformation, and our thinking must also undergo a great transformation. Some non-Party cadres, who originally only intended to listen to the meeting's transmissions, also dispelled their concerns and spoke freely after studying the documents.
    The issue of contradictions among the people sparked heated debate in the groups. In the beginning, many cadres were unable to shift their thinking, and the boundaries between contradictions between the enemy and us and contradictions among the people were unclear. The representatives cited some specific examples: In 1953, five teachers from Shantou Jinshan Middle School, including Liu Shengmu, were constantly giving opinions to the leadership, and the school leaders believed that they were an "anti-Party clique." After struggle, four of them were transferred to other jobs, and two were expelled from the Communist Youth League, causing other teachers to be full of concerns. After investigation, the truth was clarified and the matter was re-handled. The representative of Lingshan County told a fact that very well illustrates this issue. In a certain place in Lingshan County, the masses were very superstitious, worshipping stones, which affected production. After persuasion and education, some masses no longer worshipped. However, one cadre believed that destroying the stones would "eliminate superstition," and as a result, the stones were destroyed. Not only did the masses' superstitious thinking not disappear, but it also caused greater dissatisfaction among the masses. In the end, the problem was solved through persuasion and education.
    The most debated issue was the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend." Some representatives said: The current situation is that they are letting go, but are also afraid of "letting go." Relevant departments are grasping too tightly and rigidly.
    The most debated issue was the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend." The majority of the representatives wholeheartedly supported this policy, and the non-Party cadres were particularly excited. They believe that "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" is a long-term fundamental policy for the development of science and art in our country. From the perspective of Cantonese opera, after the implementation of the "Let a hundred flowers bloom" policy, the repertoire is richer and more colorful than before, and many traditional repertoires have been excavated and reorganized. Plays that were not dared to be performed in the past are now being staged. For example, the Cantonese opera "Bitter Phoenix Loves the Oriole" is popular with the masses. Ma Shizeng, member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and famous Cantonese opera actor, said: In "Let a hundred flowers bloom," we are not afraid of poisonous weeds, because we focus on cultivating fragrant flowers. We should believe that the people have the ability to distinguish poisonous weeds, and even if poisonous weeds appear, they will not last long. Wen Juefei, a famous Cantonese opera actor, said: Multiple repertoires must be released. It is impossible to release all the good things without releasing them. However, the current situation is that they are "letting go" but also afraid of "letting go," and the relevant departments are grasping too tightly and rigidly. The same is true for "Let a hundred schools of thought contend," only through "contending" can the truth be contended for.
    Many representatives believe that in the past, the criticism of literature and art adopted crude methods and did not adopt an attitude of treating the illness to save the patient.
    Many representatives have opinions on the issue of criticism. They believe that in the past, the criticism of literature and art adopted crude methods and did not adopt an attitude of treating the illness to save the patient. The writer Han Meng pointed out that the criticism of the novel "Old Fox" was like this, immediately being labeled with the big hat of "anti-realism." This does not conform to the Party's policy on literature and art and must be changed. Wen Juefei, a famous Cantonese opera actor, said: Some traditional Cantonese opera repertoires were drowned with boiling water as soon as they showed their buds. He believes that after this meeting, there will be a more prosperous situation in opera.
    The implementation of the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" is only a beginning. How to adhere to and implement this policy still requires efforts in many aspects. In this meeting, some Party cadres have not yet fully understood the spirit of Chairman Mao's instructions, and there is still resistance to the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend." Some county cadres whose county party secretaries did not attend the meeting are worried that it will be difficult to implement after returning, or that it will subside after a "gust of wind" has blown through. These problems must be further resolved in future work. (Li Ziming)

### 中共广东省委召开宣传工作会议  党内外干部一起研究党的方针

    中共广东省委召开宣传工作会议
    党内外干部一起研究党的方针
    本报广州电　中共广东省委最近召开了宣传工作会议。
    参加会议的代表们都有一个新鲜的印象：党内党外的干部一起开会研究党的方针政策，这在广东来说还是第一次。广州市文化局副局长、民盟广东省委员梁若尘说：过去贯彻政策是先党内后党外，很多党外人士有自卑感，觉得自己比人低了一等，工作就不够积极；这次会议党内外的干部一起参加，讨论党的方针政策，使非党干部增强工作的信心，也使党员干部更加明确执行党的政策必须和党外干部一起行动，对党外同志一视同仁，平等相待。他希望今后各部门各县市能够多开一些这种形式的会议。学习了毛主席的讲话，代表们感到像春风拂面，心胸豁然开朗。
    在学习讨论了毛主席在最高国务会议上的讲话和在全国宣传工作会议上的指示后，代表们感到像春
    风拂面，心胸豁然开朗，思想又一次得到了大解放。广州中山医学院副院长周寿恺说：时代大转变了，我们的思想也要来一个大转变。有些党外干部，原来只打算来听听会议传达的，学习过文件后，也解除了顾虑，畅所欲言了。
    对于人民内部的矛盾问题，在小组中引起热烈的争论，开始有不少的干部思想转不过来，对敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾的界限划分不清。代表们举出了一些具体例子：1953年间汕头金山中学教师刘声慕等五人因为平时常向领导提意见，学校的领导认为他们是“反党集团”，斗争后将其中四人调动工作，二人被开除团籍，致使其他教师顾虑重重。经过调查，才弄清真象，重新处理。灵山县代表讲了一件事实，很可以说明这个问题。灵山县有个地方，群众迷信很严重，拜石头，影响生产，经过说服教育，有些群众已不拜了。但是有一个干部认为把石头炸毁就可以“破除迷信”，结果把石头炸毁了，群众迷信思想不但没有破除，反而招致群众的更大不满。最后还是通过说服教育的方法问题才获得解决。
    争论最多的是关于“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针。有的代表说：目前的情况是又放又怕“放，”有关部门抓得太紧太死。
    争论得最多的是“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针。大多数代表衷心拥护这个方针，党外的干部格外兴奋。他们认为“百花齐放、百家争鸣”是发展我国科学和艺术的长期的根本的政策。从广东戏曲方面来看，贯彻了“百花齐放”的方针后，剧目比前丰富多采，许多传统剧目被发掘整理出来了，过去不敢演的戏也上演了。如粤剧“苦凤莺怜”受到群众欢迎。全国政协委员、粤剧著名演员马师曾说：在“百花齐放”中我们不怕毒草，因为我们着重栽培的是香花。我们应该相信人民有辨别毒草的能力，即使毒草出来也是不长久的。粤剧名演员文觉非说：必须把多种剧目都放出来。不放是不可能把一切好的东西都放出来的。但是目前的情况是又“放”又怕“放”，有关部门抓得太紧太死。“百家争鸣”也一样，只有“争鸣”才争得出真理。
    许多代表认为：过去对文学艺术的批评采取了粗暴的方法，不是治病救人的态度。
    对于批评问题，许多代表都有意见。认为过去对待文学艺术的批评是采取粗暴的方法，不是采取治病救人的态度。作家韩萌指出对小说“老油条”的批评就是这样，一下子就给扣上“反现实主义”的大帽子。这不符合党在文学艺术方面的政策，必须予以改变。粤剧名演员文觉非说：有些粤剧传统剧目，刚露出芽就给开水当头淹下去了。他相信经过这次会议，戏曲方面会出现更繁荣的局面。
    贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，现在还只是一个开端，如何坚持贯彻这一方针，还有待多方面的努力。在这次会议中，有一部分党员干部对于毛主席的指示精神还没有很好领会，对于“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针还有抵触情绪。有些没有县委书记来参加会议的县干部，担心回去难以贯彻，或者会像“一阵风”吹过以后又沉寂起来。这些问题，都必须在今后工作中继续加以解决。（李子明）
