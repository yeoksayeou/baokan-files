    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Sixteen automobile drivers on the various highway transportation lines of the Tibetan Plateau have exceeded the target of 140,000 kilometers of safe driving without major repairs.
    The thin air of the Tibetan Plateau presents many difficulties for drivers. For example, when climbing mountains more than 5,000 meters high, they will feel dizzy and short of breath. The muddy conditions during the rainy season and the icy and snowy roads in winter can easily damage vehicles. However, the difficulties did not frighten the drivers; relying on their hard work and skillful driving techniques, they overcame the difficulties and created outstanding achievements.

    西藏高原上出色的汽车驾驶员
    据新华社讯　在西藏高原的各条公路运输线上，有十六名汽车驾驶员突破了安全行驶十四万公里无大修的指标。
    西藏高原的空气稀薄，给驾驶员带来许多困难，像爬越五千多公尺的高山时，就会感到头晕气喘；雨季中的泥泞和冬季的冰雪道路，都容易损坏车辆。但是困难没有吓住驾驶员们；他们依靠辛勤劳动和熟练的驾驶技术，战胜了困难，创造了出色的成绩。
