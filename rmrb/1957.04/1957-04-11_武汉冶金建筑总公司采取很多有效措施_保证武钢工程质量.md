Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, April 9th: The Wuhan Metallurgical Construction Corporation has taken many effective measures to ensure the quality of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's construction projects.

    Starting in February, the company began to strengthen the inspection of building materials. A material inspection station was established in the main warehouse, and the number of personnel responsible for the unified inspection of building materials has been increased from three to six. Various building materials, especially steel bars and concrete materials, are subject to quality appraisal from the day they enter the warehouse; each construction unit must fill out a "Raw Material Qualification Certificate" when receiving materials. The production enterprise company, which prefabricates various components for the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's main factory, has established a special quality inspection section to strengthen operational inspections of various components from the beginning of prefabrication. In this way, the possibility of poor-quality building components is blocked from the production stage.

    Based on the suggestions of Soviet experts, the company conducted a test on the factory base before the start of construction of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's main factory to understand the quality of earthwork and the discharge and infiltration of rainwater in detail. This was done to build the factory on a solid and reliable foundation. This work started in February and is still ongoing.

    In order to ensure the construction quality of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's main factory, the Wuhan Metallurgical Construction Corporation has begun to strictly implement the "Four No Starts" system issued by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, stipulating that any major project is not allowed to start if the construction drawings have not been reviewed, the construction organization design has not been prepared, the project quality requirements and measures have not been prepared, and technical clarifications have not been given to the workers.

    Before the start of construction of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's main factory, the Wuhan Metallurgical Construction Corporation specifically held a meeting to exchange experiences in ensuring project quality during the construction preparation stage, and commended many units and individuals with good quality. In addition to widely promoting the system of workers inspecting project quality themselves, each construction company has taken some measures to ensure quality to welcome the start of construction of the main factory. The First Engineering Company, which is responsible for the construction of the refractory materials plant, had been doing civil construction. Before the start of construction of the refractory materials plant, it specially trained nearly one hundred workers to operate concrete vibrators.

### 武汉冶金建筑总公司采取很多有效措施  保证武钢工程质量

    保证武钢工程质量
    新华社武汉9日电　武汉冶金建筑总公司采取很多有效措施，保证武钢建设工程的质量。
    从2月份起，这个公司就着手加强对建筑材料的检验工作，总仓库里设立了材料检验站，负责统一检查建筑材料的人员已由三人增加到六人。各种建筑材料，特别是钢筋和混凝土材料，从进库之日起就对它们进行质量鉴定；各施工单位领料时，都要填写“原材料合格证”。为武钢主体工厂预制各种构件的生产企业公司，专门成立了质量检查科，各种构件从开始预制就加强操作检查。这样，就从生产环节上堵塞了建筑构件质量不好的可能性。
    根据苏联专家的建议，这个公司在武钢主体工厂开工以前，就对厂基进行了一次试验，详细地了解土方工程质量和雨水宣泄、渗透情况。这样做是为了把厂房建立在稳妥可靠的基础上。这个工作从2月份开始，现在还在继续进行。
    为了确保武钢主体工厂建设质量，武汉冶金建筑总公司已经开始严格贯彻冶金工业部颁发的“四不开工”制度，规定任何一项主要工程，如果施工图纸没有汇审好，施工组织设计没有编好，工程质量要求和措施没有编好，没有向工人进行技术交底，就不准开工。
   武钢主体工厂开工前夕，武汉冶金建筑总公司曾专门召开过一次会议，交流施工准备阶段保证工程质量的经验，表扬了许多质量好的单位和个人。各工程公司除了广泛推行由工人群众自己检查工程质量的制度外，都采取了一些保证质量的措施，迎接主体工厂开工。担任耐火材料厂施工的第一工程公司，原来一直做民用建筑，在耐火材料厂开工前，特别训练了近百名操纵混凝土震动器的工人。
