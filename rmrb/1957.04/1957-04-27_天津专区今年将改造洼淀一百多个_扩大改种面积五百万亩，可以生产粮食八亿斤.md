Tianjin Special District to Transform Over a Hundred Low-Lying Polders This Year
Expanding Cultivation Area by Five Million Mu, Capable of Producing 800 Million Jin of Grain

(Our dispatch) According to the Hebei Daily: The low-lying area transformation project in Tianjin Special District, Hebei Province, has fully commenced. According to local plans, this year will see the continued transformation and new transformation of 119 low-lying polders, expanding the cultivation area by five million mu, with an estimated grain production of 800 million jin, an increase of over 130 million jin compared to last year.

This year's low-lying area transformation project across the special district is being carried out on the foundation of last year's victory. Last year, 58 polders in the district were converted to grow flood-resistant and waterlogging-resistant crops across 4.2 million mu. Despite the extraordinarily heavy floods, the harvest still reached 660 million jin of grain, exceeding normal years by three to four times. This year, a total of over 30 million cubic meters of earthwork will be undertaken for polder transformation, flood prevention, and terraced field embankment projects. Simultaneously, 435 large and small sluice gates and culverts will be built for irrigation and drainage, along with the establishment of 30 boiler-locomotive pump stations and four electric pumping stations. This will enable six million mu of land across the district to avoid or mitigate waterlogging damage in the event of 120mm of rainfall. Among the five million mu of polder land undergoing conversion, 600,000 mu will be transformed into fertile land with irrigation systems.

During the polder transformation process, various localities have not only closely integrated agriculture, sideline occupations, and polder transformation projects, and actively improved work efficiency, but have also earnestly implemented the principle of thrift and diligence in polder transformation. For example, in Wen'an County, when the jointly run, state-assisted pumping station project in Yujiawa faced a shortage of stone materials, the Nanshexing Agricultural Cooperative mobilized the masses to collect over 150 broken millstones and mill rollers, solving the material shortage problem.

The large-scale polder transformation project is being carried out while continuously overcoming conservative thinking. For example, after some rice paddies in Qing County that were converted last year were flooded, some leading cadres lost confidence in this year's conversion and planned to reduce the rice planting area from 170,000 mu last year to 80,000 mu. After Zhao Ke, Secretary of the Tianjin Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, discovered this problem, he immediately went to the county to provide specific assistance and, together with County Party Secretary Zhang Jie, personally conducted on-site investigations in the eastern part of the Grand Canal, listened to the opinions of the masses, and carefully summarized the experiences and lessons of last year's conversion. They recognized the necessity and possibility of promoting low-lying area transformation throughout the county, and on this basis, revised the plan, expanding the planned rice planting area from 50,000 mu to 100,700 mu.

Currently, the low-lying area transformation project across the special district is progressing rapidly.

    天津专区今年将改造洼淀一百多个
    扩大改种面积五百万亩，可以生产粮食八亿斤
    本报讯　据河北日报报道：河北省天津专区的低洼地区改造工程已全面展开。按照各地计划，今年要继续改造和新改造的洼淀有一百一十九个，能扩大改种面积五百万亩，预计可产粮八亿斤，比去年增产粮食一亿三千多万斤。
    今年全专区的低洼地区改造工程，是在去年取得胜利的基础上进行的。去年全区有五十八个洼淀改种避涝、抗涝作物四百二十万亩，在特大洪水情况下还收获了六亿六千多万斤粮食，超过一般年景三、四倍。今年，共进行洼改、防洪、畦田土埂等土方工程三千多万公方，同时，兴建灌溉、排水的大小闸涵四百三十五座，还要建立三十座锅驼机站和四座电力扬水站。这样全区将使六百万亩土地在降雨一百二十公厘的情况下，可免除或减轻沥涝灾害。在实行改种的五百万亩洼地中，也将有六十万亩土地变成有灌溉系统的良田。
    在改造洼地当中，各地除作到了农业、副业和洼改工程的密切结合，并积极提高了工作效率外，还认真贯彻了勤俭改造洼地的方针。如文安县于家洼民办公助的扬水站工程，发生石料不足的困难，南舍兴农业社就发动群众凑集破磨盘、破碌碡等一百五十多个，解决了缺料的问题。
    大规模的洼地改造工程，是在不断克服保守思想的条件下进行的。如青县去年改种的部分稻田被特大洪水淹没后，一些领导干部对今年改种失掉了信心，计划把今年的种稻面积由去年的十七万亩降到八万亩。中共天津地委书记赵克发现这一问题后，当即深入这个县进行了具体帮助，并和县委书记张杰亲自到运河东部进行实地调查，听取了群众意见；同时，还认真地总结了去年改种的经验教训，从而认识到在全县推广低洼改造的必要和可能，在这个基础上重新修订了计划，把水淀稻面积由原来计划种植五万亩扩大到十万零七千亩。
    现在，全专区的低洼改造工程正在迅速进行。
