Handicraft Introduction

    Wenzhou Embroidery

    Wenzhou embroidery, also known as Ou embroidery, is one of the three major embroidery styles in China, along with Xiang embroidery and Su embroidery. This handicraft has a history of four to five hundred years.

    Wenzhou embroidery includes various calligraphy and paintings, as well as daily necessities such as pillows, chair backs, bed blankets, and table covers. More than two thousand pieces are produced each month and sold to Europe and the United States.

    The production process is as follows: painting artists first use light ink to draw simple and lively figures, animals, flowers, birds, and landscapes on white satin; then, embroidery artists use their skillful hands to manipulate embroidery needles as fine as hair to meticulously embroider the light ink figures, animals, flowers, birds, and landscapes.

    It truly is:

    Thousands of threads embroider Ou embroidery,
    Embroidering birds that seem to fly and beasts that seem to walk;
    Colorful silk threads,
    Matching the clouds and the flowing water.

    温州刺绣
    温州刺绣就是瓯绣，与湘绣、苏绣同称全国三大名绣。这种手工艺品已有四、五百年的历史了。
    温州刺绣有各种书画品和枕头、椅背、床毯、台毯等日用品。每月出产两千多件，远销欧美各国。
    它的生产过程是：画画艺人们先在白缎上用淡墨画上简洁明快的人物、走兽、花鸟、山水；刺绣艺人们再用灵巧的手，引动细如发丝的绣花针，把淡墨的人物、走兽、花鸟、山水等细致地绣出来。
    那真是：
    千丝万缕刺瓯绣，
    绣出鸟欲飞来兽会走；
    五颜六色彩丝线，
    配得云霞水顺流。
