    Both Happy and Ashamed
    To Comrades Jin Ge, Song Weiqie, Zhou Xiaoli, and Du Xingzhi:

    After reading Jin Ge's article "The Countryside Welcomes Us," I felt both happy and ashamed. It reminded me of a recent letter I sent to my younger brother, which I now deeply regret. My brother is currently in junior high school, and in my letter, I encouraged him to study hard and strive to enter high school, explaining that I would cover the expenses and even planned to bring him to Beijing for his studies. Isn't this making him look down on agricultural production? Although I read the newspaper every day, I haven't been able to combine theory with practice and haven't been truly educated. At the time, I thought newspaper propaganda was one thing, and actually responding was another. Why did I do this? I considered that I am a soldier, and the government will take care of military families. Is it impossible to even get this little bit of care?

    Your article has been a great inspiration to me. I am very grateful to you and will learn from your noble communist moral qualities. I plan to take active measures to provide my brother with the necessary help and education so that he recognizes the glory of participating in agricultural production and corrects the mistaken idea that participating in agricultural production is unpromising.

    Similarly, I should also work actively, study hard, and defend socialist construction.

                                   PLA Soldier Chen Qiong

    Editor's Note: The article "The Countryside Welcomes Us" was written by Jin Ge after reading the editorial in this newspaper on April 8th. This article was published on page 7 of this newspaper on April 10th.

    又高兴又惭愧金戈、宋薇茄、周笑莉、杜杏之同学：
    当我看了金戈的“农村在欢迎我们”一文后，使我又高兴又惭愧。想起我最近给弟弟的一封信来，深感遗憾。我的弟弟现在上初中，我在给他的信里，鼓励他努力学习，争取升入高中，并且说明经费有我负担，还准备接他来北京求学。这样不是叫他轻视农业生产吗？虽然我每天看报，但理论不能结合实践，没有真正受到教育。当时我想报纸宣传是一回事，响应又是一回事。我为什么要这样做呢？我考虑到，我是军人，政府对军人家属是会照顾的，难道连这点照顾都不行吗？
    你的文章对我的启发很大，我很感谢你们，同时我向你们学习那高尚的共产主义道德品质。我准备采取积极措施，对弟弟进行必要的帮助和教育，使他认识到参加农业生产的光荣，改正认为参加农业生产是没有出息的错误想法。
    同样，我也应该积极工作，努力学习，保卫社会主义建设。

    编者注：“农村在欢迎我们”一文，是金戈在读了本报4月8日的社论以后写的。此文发表在本报4月10日第七版。
