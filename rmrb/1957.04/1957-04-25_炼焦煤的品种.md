    Varieties of Coking Coal

    Primary coking coal, fat coal, lean coal, and gas coal are all bituminous coal and are the most valuable coking coal for industrial use. Although these types of coal all have strong coking properties, their advantages and disadvantages as coke raw materials vary due to the different eras in which they were formed and the geological conditions they were subjected to. Primary coking coal has the best coking property. The coke produced from it is large, strong, pressure-resistant, and wear-resistant. The disadvantage is that it easily expands when heated, and if it is used alone for coking, it is not easy to push out of the furnace after coking; its production is also very low. Fat coal also has relatively good coking properties, but it expands more easily when heated. If it is used alone for coking, the furnace can easily be damaged by expansion. Lean coal is pressure-resistant and wear-resistant, but its coking property is poor and it does not easily expand when heated. If it is used alone for coking, the coke has few pores, which affects the ventilation of the blast furnace. Although gas coal can be coked, it emits a lot of gas when heated and becomes very soft, crumbling easily under pressure. Using gas coal for coking can also release many valuable chemical elements, from which many dyes, medicines, and other chemical products can be extracted. Precisely because primary coking coal, fat coal, lean coal, and gas coal each have their own advantages and disadvantages, they must be mixed for use in order to produce good coke.

    炼焦煤的品种
    主焦煤、肥煤、瘦煤、气煤都是烟煤，是工业用煤中最宝贵的炼焦煤。这几种煤的焦结性虽然都很强，但是因为生成的年代和所处的地质情况不同，作为焦炭原料，各有优缺点。主焦煤的焦结性最好，用它炼出来的焦炭块大，结实，耐压耐磨，缺点是加热后容易膨胀，只用它来炼焦，炼好后不容易从炉子里推出来；它的产量也很少。肥煤的焦结性也比较好，但是加热后更容易膨胀，光用它来炼焦，炉子很容易被胀坏。瘦煤耐压耐磨，但焦结性较差，加热后不容易膨胀，光用它炼焦，焦炭的气孔少，影响高炉通风。气煤虽然能焦结，可是加热后就会发出很多气体，变得很松软，一压就碎了。用气煤炼焦，还可以挥发出很多宝贵的化学原素，可以从中提炼出很多染料，药物等化学产品。正因为主焦煤、肥煤、瘦煤、气煤各有优缺点，所以必须混合使用，才能炼出好焦炭来。
