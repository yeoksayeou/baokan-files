    Damascus News: Syrian President al-Quwatli condemned U.S. foreign policy at the annual National Day parade on the 17th and reaffirmed Syria's commitment to a policy of active neutrality.
    al-Quwatli said: The policies of the United States "during the Suez Canal crisis appeared to be seeking equality and peace, but after the Bermuda Conference, the face of the United States was exposed, proving that it cannot separate itself from Zionism and imperialism."
    Referring to Western accusations that Syria is a communist country, al-Quwatli said that these accusations were due to the failure of certain interest groups to persuade Syria to change its policies "in a direction that serves their purposes."
    al-Quwatli pointed out that Syria is now pursuing a policy of active neutrality and will continue to pursue this policy in the future. al-Quwatli also called on Arab countries to pursue a policy of active neutrality, engage in military cooperation with each other, and not participate in foreign military blocs.
    al-Quwatli said that Middle Eastern oil is entirely Arab oil and belongs to Arab sovereignty. He pointed out: "Those evil forces will ultimately not be able to prevail against the will of the people."
    Referring to the Soviet Union, al-Quwatli said that the Soviet Union has never asked Syria for any political or military privileges, and during the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt, the Soviet Union provided evidence of its support for the Arab national cause.
    Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, April 16th: The Syrian Foreign Ministry issued a statement on the 15th denying foreign newspaper reports that King Hussein of Jordan had requested Syria to withdraw its troops stationed in Jordan.
    The statement said that Syrian President al-Quwatli had called King Hussein on the evening of the 14th to inquire about the current situation in Jordan. After this call, King Hussein summoned the Syrian Ambassador to Jordan, Qaddamani, and handed him a "fraternal letter" explaining the situation in Jordan to al-Quwatli.
    The statement also said that after delivering the letter, Qaddamani returned to Amman on the 15th with al-Quwatli's "fraternal reply."
    There are 3,000 Syrian troops stationed in Jordan, who entered Jordan during the Anglo-French-Israeli invasion of Egypt to prepare for aggression.

    叙总统重申坚守中立
    指出美国的帝国主义面目毕露
    本报综合报道　大马士革消息：叙利亚总统库阿特利17日在一年一度的国庆检阅式上谴责美国的外交政策，并且重申叙利亚将坚持积极的中立政策。
    库阿特利说：美国的政策“在苏伊士运河危机期间看来好像是在寻求平等和和平，但是在百慕大会议后，美国的面目就暴露了，证明它不能使它自己同犹太复国主义和帝国主义分开。”
    库阿特利在谈到西方指责叙利亚为共产主义国家的时候说，这种指责是由于某些利益集团没有能够说服叙利亚“按照为它们的目的服务的方向”来改变叙利亚的政策。
    库阿特利指出，叙利亚现在坚持执行积极的中立政策，将来也将执行这个政策。库阿特利并且要求阿拉伯各国也奉行积极中立的政策，互相进行军事上的合作，而不要参加外国的军事集团。
    库阿特利说，中东的石油完完全全是阿拉伯的石油，它属于阿拉伯的主权。他指出：“那些罪恶的势力终久是不可能违背人民的意志而取得胜利的。”
    库阿特利在谈到苏联的时候说，苏联从没有向叙利亚索取任何政治或军事上的特权，在英法侵略埃及的期间，苏联拿出了支持阿拉伯民族事业的证据。
    新华社16日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚外交部15日发表声明，否认外国报纸所传约旦国王侯赛因曾经要求叙利亚撤退它驻在约旦的军队的消息。
    声明说，叙利亚总统库阿特利在14日晚上曾经打电话给侯赛因国王，向他询问了约旦目前的局势。在这次通话之后，侯赛因国王召见了叙利亚驻约旦大使卡达曼尼，并且交给他一封向库阿特利解释约旦局势的“兄弟般的信”。
    声明还说，卡达曼尼在转递了这封信以后，15日又带着库阿特利的“兄弟般的复信”回到了安曼。
    在约旦驻有叙利亚军队三千人，这些军队是在英、法、以色列发动侵埃战争期间进入约旦以防备侵略的。
