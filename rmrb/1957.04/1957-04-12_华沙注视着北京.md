    Warsaw Watches Beijing
    By Our Correspondent Hu Sisheng
    These days, the distance between Warsaw and Beijing seems to be shrinking. When the residents of Warsaw get up in the morning, they can know what happened in Beijing yesterday. April 10th was a sunny but slightly chilly day in Warsaw. On the tram, the reporter saw many passengers carefully reading the day's "Warsaw Life," the first page of which featured news of the Polish government delegation's activities in Beijing and the establishment of the Sino-Polish Friendship Association preparatory committee in Warsaw. On the bottom right corner of the second page, a Beijing dispatch was particularly eye-catching because of its unique title: "A Cool Exterior, a Fiery Interior." Reading on, the author of this Beijing dispatch, Hoffman, wrote: "The calendar tells you it's April 9th, but there is snow on the streets of Beijing, a rare occurrence even for old Beijing." The author used this unique title to describe the warm reception and busy work schedule of the Polish delegation in Beijing, explaining that although the temperature in Beijing was cool, Beijing's reception of the Polish guests was warm. After reading this dispatch, it becomes clear that the author used this title with a double meaning, because at the end of the article, the author quoted a Chinese friend as saying: "We Chinese are a bit like thermos bottles, cool on the outside but fiery on the inside."
    In a workroom on the second floor of the "Warsaw Life" editorial office, the head of the international department, Jaszunski, and the editor, Wiszucki, spoke with the reporter about their views on the Polish government delegation's visit to China. Jaszunski is the author of the first book about People's China in Polish, published in 1950, entitled "The Birth of New China." He said: "The talks between Cyrankiewicz and Beijing are of great significance because China is our closest friend. The Chinese comrades supported our new measures after last October. We clearly remember that Premier Zhou Enlai came to Warsaw twice to develop relations between the two countries."
    He also said: "I met Premier Zhou at the Geneva Conference on the Indochina issue and spoke with him. We Poles are very interested and delighted in what Cyrankiewicz said in Beijing as reported in today's newspaper. He said: 'In the near future, we will be able to welcome our most distinguished friend, the great leader of the Chinese people, in Warsaw.'"
    At this point, Wiszucki interjected, saying: "These days, the most important space in our newspaper has been taken up by the Sino-Polish talks. News, dispatches, and photos are all published on the first and second pages. Our 'Warsaw Life' has a circulation of 210,000 copies, and nearly 300,000 on Sundays. Just think how many readers that is! Not to mention the other newspapers."
    After saying this, he enthusiastically took out the Polish "New Culture Weekly" for everyone to see. This publication devoted the entire first page to Mao Zedong's recent publication of classical poetry in "Poetry Magazine." That day, the "People's Tribune" also introduced the debate about the novel by the young Chinese author Wang Meng, all of which demonstrate the great interest of the Polish people in Chinese life.
    Yesterday, the reporter visited Comrade Osmanchik, a well-known Polish political commentator and international affairs expert, Member of Parliament, and member of the Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee. In his study, we saw that the bookshelves were the walls, and the filing cabinets were the tables. This knowledgeable political commentator, who has traveled extensively throughout Europe and the Americas, began his assessment of the Sino-Polish talks in Beijing with the thesis that China's international status is increasing daily. He said: "Last November, I was in Paris. A French Foreign Ministry diplomat in charge of Eastern European affairs, Labilla, told me that he was now beginning to study China. In the current situation, although he is only responsible for Eastern European affairs, it is not enough to only study the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and other countries, because China is now also influencing the situation in Europe."
    He continued: "For Poland, the alliance and friendship with the two great powers, the Soviet Union and China, is very important. The purpose of the Sino-Polish Beijing talks is to consolidate and strengthen this alliance and friendship. Now, for me, my socialist motherland is not only Poland but the entire socialist camp. I am the most ardent supporter of Sino-Polish friendship. Come, let us drink to Sino-Polish friendship!" He took out a bottle of wine from an antique cabinet, and we drank together. At this point, he mentioned China's ancient culture, "You see, this Polish antique cabinet of mine is already three hundred years old. In the United States, a house that is eighty years old is a historical site and is displayed as a museum, but for you, I am afraid it is another point of view."
    We all laughed.
    He went on to say, "I am very happy with the development of friendly relations between China and Poland. We help and support each other. Our policy in the United Nations is to restore the seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations as soon as possible. The representative of Chiang Kai-shek there is both ridiculous and illogical. Once China's seat is restored, the situation will change, and the credibility of the United Nations itself will be improved."
    Our friendly conversation continued for two hours, and after saying goodbye, he escorted me all the way to the street.
    The sky over Warsaw was starry and the moon was bright. At this time, Beijing was probably fast asleep. However, in Warsaw, people are still watching Beijing and talking about the Sino-Polish talks in Beijing.

    华沙注视着北京
    本报记者　胡思升
    在这几天里，华沙同北京的距离似乎越来越短了。华沙的居民早晨起身后，就可以知道昨天在北京发生了什么。4月10日在华沙是一个阳光明媚但稍有寒意的日子，记者在电车上可以看到，不少乘客拿着当天的“华沙生活报”在精心阅读，第一版登载着波兰政府代表团在北京的活动和波中友协筹委会在华沙成立的消息，在第二版右下角的一篇北京通讯很引人注目，因为标题就十分别致：“温凉的外表，炽热的内容”，往下看去，这位北京通讯的作者霍夫曼写道：“日历告诉你，今天是4月9日，但是在北京的街头有积雪，这是老北京都罕见的奇事。”作者借这个别致的标题叙述了波兰代表团在北京受到的热情接待和紧张的工作日程，作者说明北京的气温虽是凉的，但北京接待波兰贵宾却是热烈的。看完这篇通讯，才知道作者用这个标题有着双关的意义，因为作者在文末引用了一位中国朋友对他说的话：“我们中国人有点像热水瓶，外表是凉的，但内心是炽热的。”
    在“华沙生活报”编辑部二楼的一间工作室内，国际部主任雅舒斯基和编辑维舒茨基同记者谈他们对波兰政府代表团访华的看法。雅舒斯基是波兰第一本关于人民中国的书的作者，这本在1950年出版的书名叫“新中国的诞生”。他说：“西伦凯维兹在北京的会谈意义重大，因为中国是我们最亲近的朋友。中国同志支持我们在去年10月后的新措施。我们清楚地记得，为了发展两国的关系，周恩来同志两次来过华沙。”
    他还说：“我在关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议上就认识了周总理并且同他谈过话。我们波兰人对今天报上登载的西伦凯维兹在北京讲的话十分感到兴趣和喜悦，他说：‘不久的将来我们就能够在华沙欢迎我们的最尊贵的朋友、中国人民的伟大领袖了。’”
    这时维舒茨基插进来说：“我们这几天报纸上最主要的篇幅都被波中会谈占去了。新闻、通讯、照片都登在第一版和第二版。我们‘华沙生活报’发行二十一万份，星期日近三十万份，你想想有多少读者？还不讲其他的报纸。”
    说过以后，他还热心地拿出波兰“新文化周刊”让大家看，这个刊物以整整第一版刊登了毛主席最近在“诗刊”上发表的旧体诗词，当天“人民论坛报”也介绍了关于我国对青年作者王蒙的小说的争论，这些都说明波兰人民对中国生活的巨大兴趣。
    昨天，记者曾访问了波兰著名政论家和国际问题专家、议会议员、议会外交委员会委员奥斯曼契克同志。在他的工作室里，我们看到书架就是墙壁，资料柜就是桌子。这位足迹几遍欧美两洲、知识渊博的政论家关于正在北京举行的中波会谈的评价是从中国的国际地位日益增高这一论题开始的。他说：“去年11月，我在巴黎。法国外交部负责东欧事务的外交官拉比拉对我说，现在他开始研究中国，在目前情况下，虽然他仅负责东欧事务，但如果仅研究苏联、捷克斯洛伐克等国家就显得不够了；因为中国现在对欧洲的局势也发生影响。”
    他接着说：“对波兰来说，同苏联和中国这两个强国的联盟和友谊是十分重要的。波中北京会谈的目的就在于巩固和加强这种联盟和友谊。现在对我来说，我的社会主义祖国不仅是波兰而且是整个的社会主义阵营。我是波中友谊的最热烈的支持者，来，让我们为波中友谊干一杯！”他从一个古色古香的橱中拿出一瓶酒来，我们一起干了杯。他这时提到了中国的古老文化，“你看我这个波兰古橱已有了三百年历史了，在美国一幢房子满八十岁就是古迹，要作为博物馆陈列起来，但对你们来说，恐怕就是另一种观点了。”
    我们大家笑了起来。
    他接着说下去：“我很高兴波中友好关系的发展。我们是相互帮助相互支持的。我们在联合国的政策就是尽早使中华人民共和国恢复在联合国的席位。蒋介石代表在那里是既可笑又不合逻辑的。中国的席位一恢复，局势就会改观，联合国自身的威信也将提高。”
    我们友好的谈话继续了两个小时，告辞后他一直送我到街上。
    华沙的上空正是月明星稀。这时的北京大约正在熟睡之中。但是，在华沙，人们还在注视着北京，谈论着北京的波中会谈。
