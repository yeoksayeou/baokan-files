    Guizhou Province, where it has been cloudy and foggy for months, cleared up for more than ten days in early March. The red line on the thermometer rose from five degrees to over twenty degrees. On the nights of March 22nd and 23rd, there were two consecutive nights of heavy rain. With the climate warm and the land moist, the preparatory activities for rice transplanting have entered the most intense stage. Currently, the agricultural activities throughout the province mainly involve repairing water conservancy facilities, building field ridges, accumulating and transporting manure, and managing spring crops. The attendance rate in agricultural cooperatives is over 90%. Every household has prepared enough firewood to burn until after the autumn harvest, and has woven piles of straw sandals. Most farmers have also prepared enough salt for the summer and autumn seasons.

    In order to further improve the spring plowing work, counties throughout the province have universally and thoroughly inspected the spring plowing situation. Addressing the problems of weak oxen, insufficient animal power, farm tools, miscellaneous grain seeds, and fertilizers existing in many agricultural cooperatives, they have quickly taken some corresponding measures, thereby greatly promoting the spring plowing work.

    气候温暖、土地润湿的贵州省
    备耕活动进入紧张阶段
    本报讯　阴雾连续数月的贵州省大部分地区，于3月上旬转晴十余天，气温表上的红线，从五度直升至二十度以上；3月22、23两天夜里，又连降两夜大雨，气候温暖、土地湿润，栽秧前的备耕活动已进入了最紧张阶段。目前全省的农事活动，主要是修水利、打田坎、积肥送粪、管理小春作物。农业社里的出工率都在90％以上。家家户户准备了足够烧到秋收后的柴草，编好了成堆的草鞋，多数农户还准备了足够一夏一秋的盐巴。
    为进一步作好备耕工作，这个省的各县已普遍深入地检查了备耕情况，并针对许多农业社存在的耕牛瘦弱、畜力、农具、杂粮种子、肥料不足等问题，迅速采取了一些相应的措施，从而大大推动了备耕工作。　（肖明）
