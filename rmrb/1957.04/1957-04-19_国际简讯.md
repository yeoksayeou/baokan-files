    In the plain areas that were previously made "no-man's lands" by the French colonists, the Vietnamese people planted bamboo, pineapples, and lychees for the first time this spring. According to the person in charge of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the main task of afforestation in Vietnam this year is to complete the planting plan of ten million "Philao" trees (a type of tree used for wind protection in coastal areas) and 170,000 pine trees.
    The people of the Fourth Interzone are currently actively implementing this plan on the coast. They and the masses in the Haiphong area have also voluntarily planted 1.5 million mangrove trees. Valuable trees such as cinnamon and longan have been planted in the mountainous areas. (Xinhua News Agency)
