Since entering March, various teams in the workshop have frequently held technical seminars to study and solve problems in production. In March, not only was a large amount of petroleum products produced, but also the defective product rate was reduced by 86% compared with February.

    玉门油厂第二车间
    三月份多炼出一千多吨油
    据新华社玉门讯　玉门油矿炼油厂第二车间到3月27日，比月度计划多生产了一千七百多吨汽油、煤油、柴油、轻机油和重机油。
    这个车间1月份的生产计划完成的不好。从2月份以来，车间的职工们积极开展增产节约运动，订出了增产的具体措施。进入3月以来，车间的各个班组经常举行技术座谈会，研究并解决生产中的问题。3月份不但增产了大量的石油产品，而且使次品率比2月份降低了86％。
