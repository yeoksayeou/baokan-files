    Xinhua News Agency, Jilin, April 15th: The workshops of the large-scale modern chemical fertilizer plant – the Jilin Fertilizer Plant – built with Soviet assistance to our country, have successively begun trial runs. In the main workshops about to go into trial production, such as the air separation workshop, things have been particularly busy lately, with Soviet experts working in shifts day and night to provide guidance.
    Recently, as spring snows have fallen here, Soviet experts, together with the workers, have braved the snow to inspect the quality of construction and installation work and various preparations for starting operations throughout the plant. Before this, with the help of Soviet experts, most of the plant's auxiliary workshops had already smoothly begun production.
    The Jilin Fertilizer Plant is the largest newly built basic chemical plant in our country. The fact that such a large-scale modern chemical plant was built in just two years is inseparable from the all-round and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union. Seventy to eighty factories in thirty to forty cities of the Soviet Union manufactured complete sets of chemical equipment for the Jilin Fertilizer Plant. The Soviet Union also supplied this plant with more than 10,000 tons of steel and chemical materials.
    From the time this plant selected its site and collected design data in 1951, the Soviet government dispatched a large number of experts to help with surveying, construction, and production preparation. The Soviet experts who came to our country to help build the plant also trained cadres for the production and construction of complete chemical fertilizer plants for our country. This plant was also designed with Soviet assistance. (Attached photo)

    苏联帮助建设的吉林肥料厂开始试车
    据新华社吉林15日电　苏联帮助我国建设的大型现代化化学肥料厂——吉林肥料厂的各车间已经陆续开始试车。在即将投入试生产的空气分离等主要车间里，近来格外繁忙，苏联专家们在这里日夜轮班进行指导。
    近日来，这里春雪纷飞，苏联专家们同职工们一道，在全厂各处冒雪检查建筑安装工程质量和各项开工准备工作。在此以前，在苏联专家帮助下全厂大部分辅助车间已经顺利地开始了生产。
    吉林肥料厂是我国新建的最大的基本化学工厂。仅仅两年就建成了这样一个大型现代化化工厂，是同苏联全面无私援助分不开的。苏联三、四十个城市的七、八十个工厂，为吉林肥料厂制造了成套的化工设备。苏联还供应了这个厂一万多吨钢材和化工材料。
    从1951年这个工厂选择厂址、收集设计资料时起，苏联政府就派遣了大批专家来帮助进行勘测、施工和生产准备工作。来到我国帮助建厂的苏联专家们还为我国培养了成套的化学肥料厂生产和建设的干部。这个厂也是苏联帮助设计的。（附图片）
