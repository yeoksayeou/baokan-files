One of the important measures for striving for a bumper harvest in agriculture is to prevent and control plant diseases and insect pests. If this work is relaxed, no matter how well other measures to increase production are done, a plant disease or insect pest disaster will greatly reduce the original production increase target.

Whether the prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests is carried out well depends first and foremost on whether the agricultural cooperative has included this work in its production plan. This is a major lesson learned from the struggle against plant diseases and insect pests in various places last year.

Some people think that the prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests is very simple. They think that it is enough to mobilize the masses to spray medicine several times after the diseases and pests occur, and there is no need to include it in the plan. This view is incorrect. The prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests should take into account costs and calculate effects. Effective prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests cannot rely solely on spraying medicine; spraying medicine must also be timely and appropriate in order to be beneficial and harmless.

The problem is very clear: preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests requires a certain amount of labor, medicine, and machinery, and requires cooperative cadres and members to be mentally prepared. If this work is placed outside the plan, and no preparations are made in advance for labor arrangements and investment, it will be too late to make temporary arrangements and carry out rush treatments after the diseases and pests become serious, which will miss the favorable opportunity and bring losses to production.

Many people believe that it is good to make plans for other production measures, but plant diseases and insect pests are unpredictable. Some years are mild, some years are severe, and prevention and control work cannot be included in the plan, and even if it is included in the plan, it cannot be implemented. Is this really the case? Obviously not. The problem lies in whether appropriate measures have been taken. Last year, the Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative in Wu'an County, Hebei Province, formulated a prevention and control plan, using fixed acreage, fixed times, fixed labor, fixed time, fixed medicine, and fixed effect to contract the control of cotton aphids. Initially, most production teams were afraid to accept it, fearing that if the cotton aphids were serious after the contract, they would have to compensate for labor if they could not control them. Later, the cooperative stipulated that each mu would be given two aphid control workers, which would generally not change; if the aphid infestation was indeed more serious than in previous years and the teams could not control it, the cooperative would add aphid control workers; if the control was timely and thorough, the saved contracted work points would be handled by the production team itself as a reward. In this way, the enthusiasm of the members for preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests was greatly improved. They assigned special personnel to check the insect situation, clear weeds from the fields, and carry medicine bags with them when going to the fields to work, and treat the aphids at any time. As a result, the cooperative's more than 49,000 mu of cotton fields were basically not curled due to aphids, ensuring a bumper harvest. The cooperative originally planned to contract 98,000 work points for aphid control and 300,000 jin of medicine. Thanks to the plan and the implementation of quota contracting, only 59,000 work points and 130,000 jin of medicine were actually used.

Facts have proved that the work of preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests can be predicted based on the laws of occurrence of various plant diseases and insect pests in the local area. It is possible to determine reasonable work quotas and remuneration standards based on different types of work such as medicine distribution, spraying, seed dressing, and insect catching, and contract the work points required for preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests to the production team or production group. This will encourage the enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of the members in preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests. Last year, many agricultural cooperatives only stipulated how many work points would be given for preventing and controlling insect pests on one mu of land, but did not make clear requirements on quality, and coupled with insufficient ideological education for the members, many members were greedy for more and faster work, and carelessly treated the insects once, using no less labor days and medicine, but with little effect. This is because there is a problem with the formulation of the contracted work plan and work quotas, which should be improved; it must not be concluded that the prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests should not be included in the contracted work plan because such a problem has occurred.

In order to materially ensure the timely progress of prevention and control work, agricultural cooperatives should allocate a certain amount of funds for the prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests when formulating financial plans; they should also include the work of repairing existing machinery in the work plan before the prevention and control season. In this way, it is possible to avoid having money but no medicine, or having medicine but no machinery, affecting prevention and control.

When including the prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests in the plan, first of all, it is necessary to put forward specific requirements based on the perennial harm of major plant diseases and insect pests in the local area, combined with the possible conditions of the agricultural cooperative, and grasp the key points of prevention and control; then, according to the laws of occurrence of plant diseases and insect pests, the specific work of prevention and control should be included in the seasonal or short-term plans. In this way, the prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests can be turned into a planned and organized action.

The busy season for preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests is coming. It is hoped that agricultural cooperatives that are revising this year's production plan will include the prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests in the plan.

(In areas where crop damage from birds and animals is serious, the prevention and control of bird and animal damage should also be included in the plan.) Agricultural cooperatives that have already revised their plans should add this item if they still have not included prevention and control work in the plan. We must try every means to change the passive situation of fighting against plant diseases and insect pests, and actively, systematically, and preparedly fight against plant diseases and insect pest disasters, and strive to prevent crop yield reduction due to plant diseases and insect pest disasters.

### 当前农业生产上应注意的事情  对农作物病虫害的斗争  要由被动变为主动

    当前农业生产上应注意的事情
    对农作物病虫害的斗争  要由被动变为主动
    防治病虫害是争取农业大丰收的重要措施之一。如果放松了这个工作，其他的增产措施做得再好，一场病虫灾害，就会给原订的增产指标打个大折扣。
    防治病虫害工作开展得好还是坏，首先决定于农业社是否把这一工作列入了生产计划。这是去年各地同病虫害作斗争中得到的一项主要经验。
    有人以为防治病虫害很简单，等到病虫发生以后，发动群众连打几次药就行了，不需要订入计划。这种看法是不对的。防治病虫害要考虑成本、计算效果。有效地防治病虫害不能单靠打药；打药也要打得及时适量，才能有利无损。
    问题很清楚，防治病虫害需要一定的劳力，需要药械，需要社干部和社员有一定的思想准备。如果把这一工作放在计划之外，事先在劳力安排上和投资上没有做准备，等到病虫害发生严重以后才临时张罗，突击除治，就会误了有利的时机，给生产上带来损失。
    有不少人认为别的生产措施都好订计划，只有病虫害捉摸不定，有的年份轻，有的年份重，防治工作不能订入计划，订入计划也无法执行。是不是真的如此呢？显然不是的。问题在于是不是采取了适当的办法。河北省武安县曙光农业社去年拟订了防治计划，用定亩、定遍、定工、定时、定药、定效的包治棉蚜。最初，多数生产队不敢接受，恐怕包了以后，棉蚜严重，治不下去时要赔工。后来社里规定每亩给两个治蚜工，一般情况下不变动；如果蚜害确实比往年严重，各队都治不了，社里再另加治蚜工；若是治得及时，彻底，节省下来的包治工分由生产队自己处理，作为奖励。这样，社员防治病虫害的积极性大大提高，指定专人检查虫情，清除田边杂草，下地做活时也带着药袋，随时挑治。结果，全社四万九千多亩棉田基本上未因蚜害而卷叶，保障了丰收。该社原订治蚜包工九万八千个，包药三十万斤，由于有了计划，又实行了定额包活，实际上只用了五万九千个工，十三万斤药。
    事实证明，防治病虫害的工作，根据当地各种病虫害发生的规律，是可以预计的。可以根据配药、喷药、拌种、捉虫等不同的工种，确定合理的工作定额和报酬标准，把防治病虫害所需的工分包到生产队或是生产组里去。这样才能鼓舞社员防治病虫害的积极性和责任心。去年有不少农业社只是规定了防治一亩地的虫害给多少工分，而在质量上没作明确要求，加以对社员的思想教育不够，结果许多社员贪多图快，马马虎虎治一遍，劳动日和药物没少用，而收效不大。这是因为制定包工计划和工作定额的工作有毛病，应该改进；决不能因为发生了这样的毛病，就认为防治病虫害不该列入包工计划。
    为了在物质上保证防治工作的及时进行，农业社在制定财务计划的时候，给防治病虫害分配一定的资金；还要把修理现有的器械的工作列入防治季节以前的工作计划。这样，才可以避免到时有钱无药、有药无械，影响防治。
    在把防治病虫害列入计划的时候，首先要根据当地主要病虫害的常年为害情况，结合农业社的可能条件，抓住防治重点，提出具体要求；然后，还要根据发生病虫害的规律，把防治的具体工作列入季节的或小段的计划。这样，才能把防治病虫害变成有计划有组织的行动。
    防治病虫害的紧张季节就要到来了。希望正在修订今年生产计划的农业社，把防治病虫害列入计划。
    （农作物鸟兽害严重的地区，也应当把鸟兽害的防除工作列入计划。）已经把计划修订好了的农业社，如果仍然没有把防害工作列入计划，也应该补上这一项。我们要想尽一切办法，改变对病虫害作斗争的被动局面，主动地有计划地有准备地对病虫灾害进行斗争，力求农作物不因病虫灾害而减产。
