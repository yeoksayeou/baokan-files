Qaidam No Longer Worries About a Shortage of Coal

A newly discovered open-pit coal mine in the Qaidam Basin, the Lvcaoshan Coal Mine, has already begun mining. Recently, many trucks have been transporting coal from here to Da Qaidan.

The Lvcaoshan Coal Mine is currently the largest open-pit coal mine discovered in the Qaidam Basin. The coal seam exposed on the surface of this coal mine is eleven kilometers long from north to south and approximately fifty meters wide from east to west. Preliminary calculations indicate that the coal reserves are about twice as large as the known reserves of the Yuka Coal Mine, which is currently under construction in Qaidam. The quality of the coal, after combustion and preliminary identification, is better than the coal from the Yeyang open-pit coal mine.

The Lvcaoshan Coal Mine was discovered in the deep mountains forty kilometers away from Da Qaidan. It is twenty kilometers away from the Yeyang Coal Mine and close to the Chaka-Mangnai Highway. The natural conditions here are very good, with a very thin overburden, and there are springs and timber, providing good conditions for large-scale mining in the future. Last year, a significant amount of coal used in Qaidam was transported from Hami, Xinjiang. Today, this situation will be completely changed.

    柴达木不愁没煤烧
    柴达木盆地发现的一个露天煤矿——绿草山煤矿，已经开始采煤。最近有很多卡车把这里的煤运到大柴旦。
    绿草山煤矿是目前柴达木盆地发现的最大露天煤矿。这个煤矿露在地面的煤带，南北长达十一公里，东西宽约五十公尺，初步计算煤的蕴藏量比目前柴达木正在建设的鱼卡煤矿的已知储量约大一倍。煤的质量经过燃烧和初步鉴定，比野羊露天煤矿的煤好。
    绿草山煤矿是在离大柴旦四十公里的深山中发现的。它离野羊煤矿二十公里，并且靠近茶（卡）茫（崖）公路。这里自然条件很好，复盖层很薄，且有泉水、木材，为今后大量开采提供了良好条件。去年，柴达木用煤还有不少从新疆的哈密运进，今天这种情况将要全部改变过来。
