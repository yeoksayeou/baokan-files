Xinhua News Agency, April 1st dispatch from Damascus: Syrian Prime Minister al-Assali said on March 31st that Syria cannot "tolerate any attempt by the United States to force it to implement the Eisenhower Doctrine."

He made these remarks while criticizing a recent statement by Eisenhower's special envoy Richards, who stated that the United States would push forward with the Eisenhower Doctrine even if Syria and Egypt rejected it.

Al-Assali told reporters: "Syria and Egypt are independent countries, and they accept aid that does not infringe upon their sovereignty. However, if the United States attempts to force acceptance of any doctrine or aid, it would mean interfering in our affairs and infringing upon our independence, which we can never tolerate."

Xinhua News Agency, April 1st dispatch from Kabul: U.S. Presidential Envoy Richards arrived in Kabul on March 31st to promote the Eisenhower Doctrine to Afghanistan.

Richards has already visited Lebanon, Libya, Turkey, Iran, and Pakistan. He told reporters in Karachi on March 30th that if he had not been invited to visit Egypt and Syria, he would not consider it a setback in his mission. He said he was visiting countries that had expressed a willingness to discuss the Eisenhower Doctrine, but he was not begging for invitations.

Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, April 1st dispatch: According to the U.S.-Pakistan joint communique released in Karachi on April 1st, the Pakistani government approves of the Eisenhower Doctrine regarding the Middle East.

The joint communique was issued after three days of talks between U.S. Presidential Envoy James P. Richards and Pakistani leaders. The communique stated that the Pakistani government expressed its willingness to cooperate with the U.S. government in "maintaining peace in the Middle East," and that Pakistan, as a member of the Baghdad Pact, has already undertaken obligations in this regard. The Pakistani government welcomes the United States not only providing military and economic aid to countries in the Middle East, but also using U.S. troops if several countries or any one country in the Middle East is subjected to so-called "armed aggression by international communist forces" and requests and deems it necessary to use U.S. troops.

The communique stated that the Pakistani government suggested to Richards that certain economic and military projects should receive aid from the Eisenhower Doctrine. Richards agreed to provide assistance in both areas. The United States will provide special loans to help Pakistan build fertilizer factories.

    叙总理驳斥美总统特使的叫嚣
    强烈反对强迫推销艾森豪威尔主义
    巴基斯坦政府接受美国奴役中东的计划
    新华社1日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚总理阿萨利3月31日说，叙利亚不能“容忍美国强迫它实行艾森豪威尔主义的任何企图”。
    他是在批评艾森豪威尔的特使理查兹最近的一项声明时说这番话的，理查兹在那一次声明中表示，即使叙利亚和埃及拒绝艾森豪威尔主义，美国仍将推行它。
    阿萨利告诉新闻记者们说：“叙利亚和埃及是自主的国家，他们接受那种不侵犯他们主权的援助，但是如果美国企图强使人接受任何主义或援助，那将意味着干涉我们的事务和侵犯我们的独立，这是我们决不能容忍的。”
    据新华社1日讯　喀布尔消息：美国总统特使理查兹3月31日到达喀布尔，向阿富汗推销艾森豪威尔主义。
    理查兹已经访问了黎巴嫩、利比亚、土耳其、伊朗和巴基斯坦，他在3月30日在卡拉奇对记者说，如果他没有受到邀请访问埃及和叙利亚，他也不认为那是他的使命中的挫折。他说，他访问的是表示愿意讨论艾森豪威尔主义的国家，但是他不是在乞求请帖。
    据新华社卡拉奇1日电　4月1日在卡拉奇发表的美巴联合公报说，巴基斯坦政府赞成关于中东的艾森豪威尔主义。
    联合公报是在美国总统特使詹姆斯·福·理查兹和巴基斯坦领导人进行了三天会谈以后发表的。公报说，巴基斯坦政府表示愿意同美国政府在“维护中东和平”方面合作，巴基斯坦作为巴格达条约的成员国已经在这方面承担了义务。巴基斯坦政府欢迎美国不仅仅是向中东地区国家提供军事和经济援助，而且是使用美国部队，如果中东地区若干国家或任何一个国家遭到所谓“国际共产主义军队的武装进攻”时要求和认为有必要使用美国部队的话。
    公报说，巴基斯坦政府向理查兹建议，某些经济和军事计划应得到艾森豪威尔主义的援助。理查兹同意在这两方面都提供援助。美国将特别贷款帮助巴基斯坦建筑肥料工厂。
