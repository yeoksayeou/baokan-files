Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The West German Trade Union Federation, with six million members, announced on the 18th its strong opposition to training West German troops in the use of atomic weapons.

    West Germany's largest trade union federation supports the declaration of eighteen scientists opposing the possession of atomic weaponry by the West German army. It also opposes the development of any form of nuclear weapon and the storage of atomic weapons in West Germany.

    The "Berliner Morgenpost" in the Democratic Sector of Berlin reported on the 17th that there is a vast underground storage facility for atomic bombs and atomic weapons in the Eifel Mountains near Bitburg, West Germany. According to news from Bonn, it is the largest American atomic weapon storage facility in Western Europe. The "Berliner Morgenpost" also said that from now until the end of 1957, several West German armored divisions, specially trained in the use of atomic weapons and equipped with such weapons, will be stationed in Hanover, Kassel, and Ratisbon. In addition to the aviation center near Karlsruhe, there are twenty-five military airfields on West German territory equipped with special facilities for parking atomic bombers. Several units of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Fourth Tactical Air Force already possess seventeen atomic rocket launch bases in West Germany, and there are plans to build another five bases in Pforzheim, Ebersbach, Darmstadt, and Lindau. A squadron of 70-Matador aircraft equipped with atomic missiles is stationed in Hunsrück.

    Earlier, eighteen prominent West German nuclear scientists protested against the equipping of the West German army with atomic weapons and declared that they would under no circumstances participate in the manufacture, testing, or use of nuclear weapons. Adenauer rebuked these scientists for not having "consulted" with him before issuing this declaration. However, because this declaration aroused widespread repercussions, Adenauer was forced to hold a six-hour meeting with prominent West German atomic scientists on the 17th. A joint communiqué issued after the meeting stated that the West German government "agrees with" the aspirations expressed by the scientists in the Göttingen Declaration. The communiqué said: "The West German government itself will not manufacture atomic weapons." The communiqué called for "worldwide nuclear disarmament."

    Observers in Bonn believe that this meeting and the joint communiqué are an election ploy by Adenauer.

    The two main opposition parties in West Germany, the Social Democratic Party and the Free Democratic Party, continued on the 18th to criticize Adenauer's policy of rearming with atomic weapons, expressing dissatisfaction with the outcome of Adenauer's meeting with the nuclear scientists.

    Free Democratic Party Chairman Maier said that the joint communiqué issued after the 17th meeting "regrettably did not dispel the anxiety of the German people that the Chancellor is preparing to proceed with his atomic armament policy."

    A statement issued by the Social Democratic Party press office said that the communiqué shows that the Adenauer government views the German question entirely from a military perspective. The communiqué made no mention of seeking to resolve the German question by political means rather than by military measures that "would lead to atomic destruction." (Attached picture)

    西德工会联合会
    反对在西德储存原子武器
    本报综合报道  据新华社讯：拥有六百万会员的西德工会联合会18日宣布极力反对训练西德军队使用原子武器。
    西德这个最大的工会联合会支持反对西德军队拥有原子军备的十八位科学家的宣言。它并且反对发展任何形式的核武器，反对在西德储存原子武器。
    柏林民主区的“晨报”17日报道，在西德比特堡的艾弗尔山中有一个广阔的原子弹和原子武器地下贮藏所。据波恩来的消息说：它是西欧最大的美国原子武器贮藏所。“晨报”又说，从现在起到1957年年底为止，受过使用原子武器的专门训练和用这种武器装备起来的西德若干装甲师，将驻扎在汉诺威、卡塞尔和腊提斯崩纳。除了在卡尔斯卢厄附近的航空中心外，在西德领土上还有二十五个设有停放原子轰炸机的特别设备的军用飞机场。北大西洋集团第四战术空军队的若干单位已经在西德拥有十七个原子火箭发射基地，并且还计划在普福尔兹海姆、艾柏斯巴哈、达姆施塔特和林道建造另外的五个基地。装备着原子导弹的一队70—斗牛士式飞机，驻扎在洪斯吕克。
    早些日子，十八位西德著名的原子核科学家曾经抗议西德军队装备原子武器，并且声明无论如何决不参加原子核武器的制造、试验和使用。阿登纳斥责这些科学家在发表这个宣言之前没有先同他“商量”。但由于这个宣言引起广泛的反响，阿登纳不得不在17日同西德著名原子科学家举行了六个小时的会谈。会谈后发表联合公报说：西德政府“赞成”科学家在戈丁根宣言中所表达的愿望。公报说：“西德政府自己将不制造原子武器”。公报呼吁“全世界实行原子核裁军”。
    波恩的观察家认为，这次会谈和联合公报是阿登纳的一个竞选把戏。
    西德两个主要的反对党社会民主党和自由民主党在18日继续指责阿登纳要用原子武器重新武装的政策，对于阿登纳同原子核科学家会谈的结果表示不满。
    自由民主党主席迈尔说，17日会谈之后发表的联合公报“令人遗憾地没有消除德国人民的这种焦虑：总理准备着手执行他的原子军备政策。”
    社会民主党新闻处发表声明说：这份公报表明阿登纳政府是完全从军事角度来看待德国问题的。公报中一点没有谈到要设法用政治方式而不是用“会导致原子毁灭”的军事措施来解决德国问题。（附图片）
