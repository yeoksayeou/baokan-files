Comprehensive report:

    "Do you think it is good to develop trade with China?" Among three thousand Japanese people, 64% answered "Yes". This is the result of a public opinion survey published by the Japanese "Central Survey Agency" on April 2.

    Developing Sino-Japanese trade is the general aspiration of the Japanese people. In March of this year, fourteen local assemblies, including Kyoto Prefecture, passed resolutions to promote Sino-Japanese trade. On April 3, the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly also passed a similar resolution. Including those passed last year and this year, forty-nine local assemblies in Japan have passed resolutions unanimously requesting the lifting of the embargo and the exchange of trade representatives.

    The Japanese trade community is actively preparing for negotiations with relevant Chinese parties to sign the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. On April 11, leaders of the Japanese Diet Members' League for the Promotion of Sino-Japanese Trade, the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, and the Japan-China Import and Export Association held a meeting to decide on the candidates for the negotiation team and the expert committee. However, the Japanese government has not yet taken effective measures to develop Sino-Japanese trade. "Yomiuri Shimbun" demands that the Japanese government quickly resolve the so-called "fingerprint issue" in order to exchange trade representatives between Japan and China and allow Sino-Japanese trade to develop smoothly.

    发展对中国的贸易好吗？
    日本大多数人都说：好！
    本报综合消息　“你认为发展对中国的贸易好吗？”在三千名日本人中，有64％的人回答说：“好”。这是日本“中央调查社”在4月2日发表的舆论调查结果。
    发展中日贸易是日本国民的普遍愿望。今年3月间，京都府等十四个地方议会通过了促进日中贸易的决议。4月3日，东京都议会也通过了同样的决议。连同去年和今年的在内，日本已经有四十九个地方议会通过决议，一致要求取消禁运和交换通商代表。
    日本贸易界为和中国有关方面谈判签订第四次中日贸易协定，正积极进行准备工作。4月11日，日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟、日本国际贸易促进协会和日中输出入协会的领导人举行会议，就谈判小组和专家委员会的人选问题作出了决定。但是，日本政府至今对发展日中贸易问题仍然没有采取有效的措施。“读卖新闻”要求日本政府赶快解决所谓“按手印问题”，以便日中双方交换通商代表，使日中贸易得以顺利发展。
