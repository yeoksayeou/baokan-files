Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 5th. A responsible person of the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee told Xinhua News Agency reporters on the 4th: With strong support from the central government and the unfolding of a city-wide campaign to increase production and practice thrift, the tight raw material supply situation for Shanghai's local industries has been slightly eased. It is expected that the total output value of local industries this year will still exceed last year's level.

The original plan for Shanghai's local industries was to complete 21% of the annual plan in the first quarter, but the result exceeded the target, reaching about 24% of the annual plan.

This responsible person said: From the perspective of the whole year, the second quarter will be the most difficult. Now, through the efforts of all parties, the supply of raw materials in the second quarter will be guaranteed to be no lower than the level of the first quarter. Among the 180 major raw materials, 111 can meet the needs, 44 can basically maintain production, and only more than 20 are facing relatively large supply difficulties. Therefore, it is expected that the production of Shanghai's local industries in the second quarter can still maintain the level of the first quarter, that is, reach about 24% of the annual plan.

He said: In the struggle to overcome raw material difficulties, the central government has provided great support to Shanghai. Many kinds of raw materials in tight supply were allocated to Shanghai after compressing the needs of some basic construction projects; the central government also gave priority to Shanghai when allocating some raw materials, such as ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals, and certain chemical raw materials.

Workers and neighborhood residents throughout the city have also made effective efforts in implementing various measures to overcome raw material difficulties. The steel industry increased production by more than 5,000 tons of steel and more than 10,000 tons of steel products in the first quarter compared to the plan. One-third of the raw materials for the paper industry are resolved by purchasing waste paper, rags, and waste hemp from neighboring provinces and urban areas, enabling the first quarter, when raw materials were unprecedentedly scarce, to produce more than 1,000 tons of paper than planned. More than 5,000 people from commercial and industrial departments are often dispatched to purchase raw materials throughout the country, and they have made great contributions.

This responsible person then talked about the industrial production arrangements for the whole year. He said: Recently, after discussions by the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee, the city's local industrial production plan for 1957 is slightly higher than that of 1956. Among them, except for the textile industry, which will reduce production due to difficulties in the supply of raw cotton, light industry can grow by about 4%, and heavy industry will also grow if sales do not change much. Judging from the situation in various aspects, the supply of raw materials in the third and fourth quarters may be better than in the first and second quarters. But in general, the supply of raw materials still cannot keep up with the needs of production development. In particular, agricultural products such as cotton and other raw materials, as well as certain varieties and specifications of metal and chemical raw materials, still have difficulties in supply. At the same time, the implementation of many measures to increase production and practice thrift will take some time. Therefore, to complete this year's plan, it will still require great efforts from all parties.

    经过中央大力支持和全市增产节约运动的展开
    上海原材料供应紧张情况略见缓和
    新华社上海5日电　上海市人民委员会负责人4日对新华社记者说：经过中央大力支持和全市增产节约运动的展开，目前上海地方工业原材料供应紧张的情况已略见缓和，预计今年地方工业的总产值仍将超过去年的水平。
    上海地方工业原计划第一季度的总产值完成全年计划的21％，结果超额完成，达到全年计划的24％左右。
    这位负责人说：从全年来看，第二季度的困难最大。现在，经过各方面的努力，第二季度原材料的供应将可以保证不低于第一季度的水平。在一百八十种主要原材料中，能满足需要的有一百十一种，基本上可以维持生产的有四十四种，供应困难较大的只剩下二十多种。因此，预计第二季度上海地方工业的生产，仍然可以保持第一季度的水平，即达到全年计划的24％左右。
    他说：在克服原材料困难的斗争中，中央对上海支持很大。有许多种供应紧张的原材料，是在压缩了一些基本建设的需要以后调拨给上海的；有些原材料中央在调拨时也首先照顾了上海，像黑色金属、有色金属以及某些化工原料就是这样解决的。
    全市职工和里弄居民在实现各项克服原材料困难的措施中，也作出了有效的努力。钢铁工业第一季度比计划增产了五千多吨钢和一万多吨钢材。造纸工业三分之一的原料是依靠收购邻省和市区的废纸、破布和废麻绒来解决的，使原料空前缺乏的第一季度还比计划多生产了一千多吨纸张。商业和工业部门派赴全国各地采购原材料的人员经常有五千多人，他们作出了很大的贡献。
    这位负责人接着谈到今年全年的工业生产安排。他说：最近经过上海市人民委员会讨论，全市地方工业1957年生产计划比1956年还略有增长。其中除纺织工业因原棉供应有困难要减产以外，轻工业约可以增长4％，重工业假使销路变动不大也将有所增长。从各方面情况来看，三、四季度原材料供应情况可能比一、二季度要好一些。但总的说来，原材料的供应还是赶不上生产发展的需要。特别是农产品如棉花等原材料，以及金属、化工原料中某些品种和规格，在供应上仍有困难。同时，许多增产节约措施的实现，都还需要一段时间。因此，要完成今年的计划，就还需要各个方面作出很大的努力。
