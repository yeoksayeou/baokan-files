The Everlasting Combat Friendship Between the Marshal and the Workers
    ——Introducing a Cartoon and a Letter from Twenty-Two Years Ago
    Xiao San
    I once clipped a copy of the Soviet "Komsomolskaya Pravda" from November 26, 1935, and miraculously managed to preserve it until now without losing it, though it is a bit worn. This newspaper contains a friendly cartoon of Chairman Voroshilov by Briskin, and a joint letter to him from ten old workers of Donbas-Lugansk (now Voroshilovgrad), his old comrades-in-arms. Today, on the occasion of Chairman Voroshilov's friendly visit to our country at the invitation of Chairman Mao Zedong, our newspaper is reprinting this friendly cartoon and excerpting the joint letter for our readers. I think it will help to understand the life of our distinguished guest, and at the same time, it will serve as a heartfelt welcome to the leader of our great ally!
    The cartoon depicts him wearing worker's clothes and holding a hammer, which shows that Comrade Voroshilov was born as a worker—he once worked as a fitter in the former Hartmann factory in Lugansk (Lugansk was renamed Voroshilovgrad for this reason); with a smile on his face, which not only resembles his original appearance but also portrays his straightforward character and optimistic spirit.
    The joint letter is quite long, and its main content is to recall Comrade Voroshilov's underground work in Donbas before the October Revolution, his secret revolutionary activities and armed uprisings, as well as his work experience in the domestic war after the October Revolution.
    It was when Comrade Voroshilov was awarded the title of Marshal that these ten old comrades of his wrote to him to congratulate him. They addressed him as "Our dear Kliment Yefremovich" (hereinafter referred to as "K.Y." in the translation).
    The letter recalled how Voroshilov brought some Browning pistols from Finland to arm the then underground army, and how they made armored trains themselves according to his orders to resist the Germans and Gaidamaks White Guards, and so on.
      "This letter is sent to 'Komsomolskaya Pravda' for publication for the benefit of the youth." The letter said, "Young people are now very concerned about a question: how to build friendships. Look, children, this is the friendship between the first Marshal of the Soviet Union and the workers of Lugansk. Those Browning pistols of 1905 have long been used well, and those armored cars of 1918 have also rusted and broken, but our old fighting friendship with the People's Commissar of Defense (Comrade Voroshilov was then holding this position, i.e., Minister of Defense - translator's note) has not rusted at all!..."
    It goes on to say: "A true comrade—that is one who helps each other in the common struggle for an ideal, without stinting himself." The letter cites the example of Comrade Voroshilov being such a comrade and friend during his underground work.
    In 1905, there was a comrade named Guzhenetsov, who organized the workers' uprising in Donbas-Gorlovka. In the street fighting, a cavalryman broke his hand. All those who participated in the uprising were transported far away from the proletariat of Donbas and imprisoned in Kharkov and other places. Only Guzhenetsov was temporarily lying in the Gorlovka hospital under the strictest surveillance. There was almost a row of soldiers guarding him! Comrade Voroshilov, regardless of all danger, decided to rescue this comrade. He used a trick, took some vodka mixed with sleeping pills, got the guards drunk, and broke into the hospital. Everything was ready: the workers' picket line was set up, the horses were ready, and even the leather coat to wrap the injured was fully prepared. That winter was terribly cold.
    But, unfortunately, Guzhenetsov could not escape. After losing too much blood, he was so dizzy that he could not support himself and could not get up at all... Comrade Voroshilov returned to Lugansk, so anxious that he almost pulled out his own hair...
      "Therefore, all the workers love K.Y., knowing that he is a good friend. If he himself is in danger, all the workers of Lugansk will rise up to protect him, and the Hartmann factory will naturally be at the forefront of everyone."
      "You remember, in 1905, the workers surrounded the prison where you were imprisoned. The first time they were dispersed by the Cossacks with whips, but the second time they held a thousand-strong rally, shouting and demanding the immediate release of our Kliment. This noisy rally continued for two days. In the evening, K.Y. came out of the prison and went straight to the meeting place. Everyone was overjoyed and immediately elected him as the chairman of the meeting."
      "K.Y., you taught us not only to be loyal to class friends and comrades, but also to be ruthless and hate the enemy...."
      "We are proud to have been the first underground army led by you. You remember those tens and hundreds of envelopes, each underground army member received these secret instructions, and they would all open them to read when the alarm siren sounded... This was the alarm to start the uprising. Until now, some foreigners think that Voroshilov was probably originally a general who later came over to the Red Party."
      "But we know in what 'military academy' the current People's Commissar of Defense received his initial military education... In the field, an old Bolshevik, a former officer, taught us to shoot. Voroshilov then became one of the best shooters. At that time, his military talent was already showing. Without specialized military education, he paid attention to the construction of bombs, made his own drawings, and taught us how to make them. We almost made no secret of making bombs while working the night shift. Once the foreman walked up to our worker, looked through his glasses, and asked: 'What is this?!' Our people replied calmly: 'This is an oil tank cover!'"
      "What we remember most clearly is you, K.Y., bringing weapons back to us from Finland. At that time, we were very happy to have sent someone to attend the party congress in Stockholm, but you brought back not only the party's instructions from there, but also Browning pistols, hidden in ××'s house... At that time, a comrade said: 'He armed us correctly. Give the workers ideas in their heads, and guns in their hands!'"
    In 1917, the workers of Lugansk took out those weapons from the underground again and cleaned them well. Here again became a fortress of the proletariat. Comrade Voroshilov sent many boxes of weapons from Kharkov to arm the Red Guards he organized.
    "You remember, when the armed workers of Lugansk set off to the front to resist the German invaders, our mothers, women, and children made many paper roses to decorate your horse, because there were no medals at that time, etc., they were paper flowers, because it was winter and there were no fresh flowers..."
    "You remember, K.Y., you were concussed while fighting the Germans at the Dubavyazovsk station? You lay there for two hours, unconscious, but as soon as you woke up, you got up from the ground. Vanya Bredoroshko was taken aback. Your entire left temple was burned, and your hair was burned red and curled up. 'You got up too early, K.Y.' he could only say such a sentence..."
    The letter then described the process of the Lugansk workers participating in the Battle of Tsaritsyn in April 1918, the temporary retreat, how Comrade Voroshilov and the armed workers came to Tsaritsyn with difficulty and hardship and met Stalin... They walked a section, dismantled the back section of the rails, and laid the front section again. There was no water, and the women who retreated with the army took it from the ditches bucket by bucket, bowl by bowl, jar by jar, and delivered it to the locomotive...
    "You remember? Once the car you were in suddenly broke down, and it was exposed in front of the Cossacks. Fortunately, the car was covered with iron sheets, and the bullets could not hit you. But when you returned to the train, we all surrounded you, unable to take our eyes off your sun-faded military uniform. It was all in strips... The bullets hit the iron sheets and bounced up, and the metal fragments tore the military uniform. You took it off, looked at it, sighed reluctantly, and said: 'It used to be a good military uniform!'"
      "Children, in the summer of 1918, Voroshilov transported to Tsaritsyn: one hundred locomotives, three thousand carriages, loaded with bullets and machine tools, 30,000 soldiers and our families. Not long after, there was another departure for Tsaritsyn, but it was from the Velikoknyazheskaya station, led by Comrade Budyonny, who brought thousands of peasants from the outer city and Don Cossacks from the railway, through the Salsk steppe."
      "Some of us then followed you, K.Y., to the First Cavalry Army. Others fought on other fronts. Later, we returned to our hometown of Lugansk and resumed our factory construction. Although you did not return to Lugansk, you are still its first citizen. You remember, K.Y., how you handed over the Red Banner Medal awarded by the government to our city in 1925? You also remember the acropolis hero monument we built at your suggestion? You were the first to donate money! You protected the former Hartmann factory at the Sixteenth Party Congress, when some people advocated shutting it down..."
      "If we used to defend our factory, our home, our narrow streets, the dirty and unsightly Lugansk like that, then, you think, K.Y., how will we defend it now, this new Voroshilovgrad in which we have invested so much energy?"
      "Don't think, K.Y., that we are some old men. Age doesn't matter. Our eyes are as bright as before, our hands are strong, and when we hear your name, like a battle call, we become young again, really! We don't feel like stroking our beards, shrugging our shoulders, our eyes only looking at the door, maybe suddenly our K.Y. will come in with rapid steps!..."
      "Not long ago, Vanya Bredoroshko—you know, he is already sixty-five years old—walked from Lugansk to Tsaritsyn again. He walked with the members of the Youth League along the line of march, telling them where there had been battles and who was buried in which tomb. There, you know, on both sides of the roadbed are all fraternal tombs."
      "Bredoroshko told us that the young people were really great. When they listened to him tell battle stories, their eyes were burning and their fists were clenched! It was worth fighting for such children, K.Y., and it will be pleasant to fight with them in the future..."
      "...We are proud to have such an outstanding general as you, K.Y..."
      "As long as we hear our familiar voice ringing throughout the country and the Voroshilov password: 'Fight!', dear K.Y., believe me, all your old men will stand up immediately."
      "We wish you health and longevity, to make the enemy afraid and give us glory, our dear Kliment Yefremovich!"
    The youngest of the ten old men who jointly signed the letter was fifty-four years old, and the oldest was sixty-five years old. Names omitted.

    元帅和工人永不生锈的战斗友谊
    ——介绍二十二年前的一幅漫画和一封书信
    萧三
    我曾经剪下一份1935年11月26日的苏联“共青团真理报”，可说是奇妙地一直保存到现在还没有遗失，只是破旧了一点。这张报纸上面有一幅布力司金作的伏罗希洛夫主席底友好的漫画像，和一封他的老战友，顿巴斯—鲁干斯克（现名伏罗希洛夫格勒）十位老工人写给他的联名信。今天趁伏罗希洛夫主席接受毛泽东主席邀请而光临我国作友好访问的日子，由我们的报纸把这幅友好的漫画像重印发表，并把那封联名信摘译出来，以饷读者，我想，当有助于认识我们的贵宾底生平，同时就用这来对我们伟大盟国的元首表示衷心的欢迎！
    漫画像身穿工服，手扶铁锤，这说明伏罗希洛夫同志是工人出身——他曾经在鲁干斯克前加尔特曼工厂作过键工（钳工）（就因为这个缘故，鲁干斯克改名为伏罗希洛夫格勒）；面带笑容，不仅很像他的本来面目，也画出了他的爽直性格和乐观气派。
    联名信颇长，内容主要是回忆伏罗希洛夫同志在十月革命以前在顿巴斯作地下工作，搞秘密革命活动和武装起义的情况，以及十月革命以后国内战争中他的工作经历。
    是伏罗希洛夫同志荣膺元帅称号的时候，这十位他的老同志给他写信祝贺。他们称呼他为“我们亲爱的克利门特（名）·叶弗列莫维奇（父名）”（译文以下都简作“克·叶·”）。
    信中回忆了伏罗希洛夫怎样从芬兰带回一些勃朗宁手枪来武装当时的地下军，他们怎样照他的命令自己制造铁甲列车，以抵抗德国人和盖达马克白党等等故事。
      “这封信寄到‘共青团真理报’发表，为的是对青年有益处。”信中说，“青年人现在很关心一个问题：怎样建立友谊。瞧吧，孩子们，这就是苏联第一个元帅和鲁干斯克工人们的友谊。那些1905年的勃朗宁手枪早已好好地用过了，那些1918年的铁甲车也生锈坏了，但是我们和国防人民委员（那时伏罗希洛夫同志担任此职，即国防部长——译者注）的老的战斗的友谊一点也没有生锈！……”
    下面接着说：“真正的同志——那就是为了一个理想共同奋斗而彼此相助，一点也不吝惜自己。”信中举出伏罗希洛夫同志在地下工作时就是这样一个同志和朋友的范例的事实。
    1905年有一位同志叫古自涅错夫，他组织顿巴斯——戈尔洛夫卡的工人起义。在巷战中一个骑兵打断了他的手。所有起义的都被运去离开顿巴斯无产阶级远远的地方，关到哈尔科夫等地的监狱里去了。只有古自涅错夫一人在最严格的监视下暂时躺在戈尔洛夫卡病院里。差不多有一排兵看守他！伏罗希洛夫同志不顾一切危险，决定去抢救这位同志。他施用计策，带了些兑了安眠药的烧酒去，把看守的都灌醉了，他闯进了病院。一切都准备好了：工人纠察队摆好了，马也备好了，甚至裹装伤者的皮大衣也全备了。那个冬天正冷得厉害。
    但是，不幸，古自涅错夫没有能逃出来，他在失血过多之后，头晕得无法支持，完全不能起来……伏罗希洛夫同志回到鲁干斯克，焦急得几乎把自己的头发都拔掉了……
      “由此，所有的工人都爱克·叶·，知道他是够朋友的。如果他自己有什么危险，全鲁干斯克的工人都起来保护他，加尔特曼厂的自然更在一切人的前面。”
      “你记得，1905年工人们包围了监禁你的那所监狱。第一次被哥萨克们用鞭子驱散了，但第二次举行了一个千人的大会，大喊大叫，要求立即释放我们的克利门特。这个吵闹的大会继续了两天。到晚上克·叶·从监狱里出来，径直走到会场，大家高兴极了，立即选他为大会主席。”
      “克·叶·，你教会了我们，不仅对阶级朋友和同志要忠诚，也教会了我们对敌人要狠，要恨。……”
      “我们以能够成为你所带领的第一支地下军而自豪。你记得那成十成百的信封，每个地下军成员收到这些秘密指示，在放警报汽笛的时候就都拆开来看……这是开始起义的警钟。直到现在还有些外国人认为伏罗希洛夫大概原来就是一个将军，后来过到红党方面来的。”
      “我们却知道，现在的国防人民委员是在什么‘军事学院’受到最初的军事教育的……在野外，一位老布尔什维克，前军官，教我们射击。伏罗希洛夫那时就学成了一位最好的射击手。那时已经表现出他的军事才能。没有受过专门军事教育，他注意炸弹的构造，自己制图，教我们作。我们差不多没有隐瞒，在上夜班时制造炸弹。有一次工头走到我们的工人面前，透过眼镜，问道：‘这是什么？！’我们的人不动声色地答说：‘这是油罐盖盖！’”
      “我们记得最牢的是你，克·叶·，从芬兰给我们带武器回来这件事。我们那时候顶高兴的是，派了人去参加在斯德哥尔摩举行的党代表大会，你却从那边不仅带回了党的指示，而且带了勃朗宁手枪回来，藏在××家里……那时候一位同志说：‘他把我们武装起来的对。给工人的脑子里以思想，给手里以手枪！’”
    在1917年，鲁干斯克的工人又从地下取出那些武器，好好擦干净。这里又成了无产阶级的堡垒。伏罗希洛夫同志从哈尔科夫送来许多箱武器，为了武装他所组织的红色近卫队。
    “你还记得吧，当鲁干斯克的工人武装出发到前线去抵抗德寇的时候，我们的母亲们、女人们和孩子们作了许多纸的玫瑰花，把你的马装饰起来，因为那时还没有什么勋章等等，是纸花，因为那是冬天，没有鲜花……”
    “你还记得，克·叶·，在杜巴维亚左夫斯克站你在和德国人作战时受了震伤的事么？你躺着两小时，失了知觉，但刚一苏醒过来就从地上起来了。凡尼亚·卜力多若史科大吃一惊。你的整个左鬓都烧焦了，头发也烧红了，卷曲了。‘你起身的太早了，克·叶·’他只能说这么一句话……”
    信中接着叙述1918年4月鲁干斯克工人参加保卫察里津之战的经过，临时的撤退，伏罗希洛夫同志和工人武装如何艰难困苦地来到察里津和斯大林会合……走一段，拆后面一段铁轨，又铺前面一段，没有水，随军撤退的女人们就从沟里一桶、一碗、一缸地取来传递，送到火车头去……
    “你记得么？有一次你坐的汽车忽然抛锚了，正露在哥萨克的面前。幸喜车子是用铁皮包了的，子弹没有能打到你。但是当你回到列车来的时候，我们都围着你，眼睛离不开你那件被太阳晒得褪了色的军便服。它全成了条条块块的……子弹打到铁皮上跳起来，金属的碎片挂破了军便服。你脱掉它，看了看，很舍不得地叹口气说道：‘它曾经是一件好好的军便服呀！’”
      “孩子们，1918年夏天伏罗希洛夫运到察里津来的有：一百个火车头，三千个车厢，里面装的是子弹和工床，三万个战士和我们的家属。不久以后又有过一次向察里津出发的事，但那是从维力科克涅亚时斯克站，由布琼尼同志率领的，他从铁路，经过萨尔司克草原带了几千个外城农民和顿河哥萨克人来。”
      “我们里面有一些人此后跟着你，克·叶·，到第一骑兵队去了。别的人在别的前线上作战。以后我们回到了故乡鲁干斯克，恢复自己的工厂建设。你虽没有回鲁干斯克来，但仍然是它的第一个市民。你记得，克·叶·，1925年你怎样把政府颁发的红旗勋章交给我们城市的吧？由你倡议的，我们建立的卫城英雄纪念碑，你也记得吧？你是第一个捐款的人呀！你在第十六次党代表大会上保护了前加尔特曼工厂，那时有人主张停办它……”
      “假如我们从前是那样保卫了自己的工厂，自己的家，自己的窄狭的街巷，肮脏的和不漂亮的鲁干斯克，那么，你想，克·叶·，我们现在将怎样来保卫它，我们自己投入了多少精力的这个新的伏罗希洛夫格勒呢？”
      “你不要以为，克·叶·，我们是一些老头儿了。年龄是没有关系的。我们的眼睛是和从前一样明的，手是结实的，听了你的名字，就像战斗的号召，我们就年轻起来，真的！就不觉得捻捻胡子，挺振肩膀，眼睛只看着门，也许突然我们的克·叶·走着急速的步子就会进来的！……”
      “不久以前，凡尼亚·卜力多若史科——你知道，他已经六十五岁了——重新从鲁干斯克步行到察里津走了一趟。他和青年团员们沿着进军的道路走，一路上对他们讲，哪里有过战斗，谁埋葬在哪个坟墓里。那里，你知道，在路基的两旁全是兄弟冢呀。”
      “卜力多若史科对我们说，青年们实在好极了。他们听他讲战斗故事的时候，眼睛都燃烧起来了，拳头捏紧了！为这样的孩子们奋斗，曾经是值得的啊，克·叶·，将来和他们站在一道去战斗也是愉快的……”
      “……我们以有你这样出色的将领而自豪，克·叶·……”
      “只要听见在全国响着我们熟悉的声音和发出伏罗希洛夫的口令：‘战呀！’亲爱的克·叶·，你相信吧，所有你的老头们都会立即站起队来的。”
      “我们祝福你健康长寿，使敌人害怕和给我们光荣，我们亲爱的克利门特·叶弗列莫维奇！”
    联名信末署名的十个老人最年轻的五十四岁，最年长的六十五岁。名从略。
