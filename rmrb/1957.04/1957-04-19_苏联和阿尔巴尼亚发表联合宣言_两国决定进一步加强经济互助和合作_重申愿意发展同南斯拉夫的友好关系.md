Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 18th—TASS reports: The joint declaration of the Soviet Union and Albania, signed in Moscow on April 17, stated that the relations between the Soviet Union and Albania are a vivid example of a new type of relationship between peoples, which fully conforms to the interests of the two peoples and the interests of all socialist countries. In the great socialist family of nations, Albania is an equal country.

This declaration, signed by Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Albania, Shehu, pointed out that under the capitalist system, there are no, nor can there be, conditions for genuine equality and cooperation between large and small countries, while the relations between socialist countries, large and small, have always been based on fundamentally new principles from the very beginning, namely, on the principles of proletarian internationalism of Marxism-Leninism, on the principles of equality, sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, mutual respect, and mutual aid and support.

The declaration then stated that the governments of the Soviet Union and Albania declare that, in accordance with the strong desire of the people of both countries to live in peace and friendship with the people of all other countries, the two governments will continue to take necessary measures to safeguard and consolidate universal peace and international security, and will base their foreign policies on the principle of peaceful coexistence of countries with different socio-economic systems.

The two governments declare that, due to the rampant sabotage activities of international reactionary forces against socialist countries, there is an urgent need for the people to maintain constant vigilance, maintain the unity of socialist countries, and continuously develop and strengthen the fraternal relations of countries in the socialist camp.

The declaration exposed the attempts by American imperialists to replace Britain and France in their colonial positions in the Middle East. The declaration stated that the governments of the Soviet Union and Albania fully support the aspirations and efforts of the people of the Near and Middle East countries to oppose colonialism and defend freedom, national independence, and sovereignty.

The governments of the Soviet Union and Albania declared that the people of their countries sincerely hope to improve relations between the Balkan countries, expand their comprehensive ties, and strengthen trust between them. The Soviet government supports the efforts of the Albanian government to improve relations with Greece and Italy.

The two governments reiterated their willingness to improve and strive to develop relations with Yugoslavia on a basis of sincere friendship, and expressed their belief that Yugoslavia will also work towards this end; now, in this regard, much depends on Yugoslavia.

The declaration then stated that the two governments declare that the Balkan Pact is an exclusive military bloc of Yugoslavia, Greece, and Turkey. The existence of this pact cannot promote the establishment of stability in the Balkan Peninsula and cannot but arouse some distrust among the people of other Balkan countries towards the intentions of the above-mentioned treaty signatories. Moreover, since one of the signatory countries is a member of the North Atlantic Group and the other is both a member of the North Atlantic Group and the Baghdad Pact, this links the Balkan Pact with these aggressive blocs.

The declaration then stated that the economic relations between the Soviet Union and Albania were comprehensively discussed and studied during the talks. Both sides pointed out that economic cooperation between the two countries is developing on the principles of proletarian internationalism, brotherly friendship, equality, and mutual assistance. The Soviet government decided to cancel Albania's debt to the Soviet Union of 348 million rubles, which is equal to the total value of various enterprises built in Albania with Soviet loans. In addition, the debt owed by Albania for loans to pay for various equipment and materials supplied by the Soviet Union, outstanding as of January 1, 1957, amounting to a total of 74 million rubles, was also cancelled.

In order to help the Albanian government implement measures to develop agriculture and industry in recent years, the Soviet government expressed its readiness to provide Albania with the necessary technical assistance in 1957 and 1958.

The Soviet Union will supply Albania with complete sets of equipment for the construction of hydroelectric power stations, petroleum industry equipment, tractors, agricultural machinery, and soil improvement equipment from previously granted loans.

The two sides agreed to sign a trade and navigation treaty, a nationality agreement, an agreement on mutual legal assistance in criminal and civil cases, and a treaty on consular issues.

    苏联和阿尔巴尼亚发表联合宣言
    两国决定进一步加强经济互助和合作
    重申愿意发展同南斯拉夫的友好关系
    新华社18日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：4月17日在莫斯科签字的苏联和阿尔巴尼亚的联合宣言说：苏阿两国关系是各国人民之间的新型关系的鲜明范例，这种关系完全符合两国人民的利益，符合一切社会主义国家的利益。在伟大的社会主义国家大家庭里，阿尔巴尼亚是一个平等的国家。
    这一篇由苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和阿尔巴尼亚部长会议主席谢胡签署的宣言指出，在资本主义制度下，没有、也不可能有条件使大国与小国之间存在真正的平等关系和合作，而社会主义大小国家之间的关系从一开始就始终建筑在原则上完全新的基础上，即建筑在马克思列宁主义的无产阶级国际主义原则上，建筑在平等、主权和领土完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、互相尊重以及互相援助和支持的原则上。
    宣言接着说，苏阿两国政府声明，按照两国人民希望同其他一切国家的人民和平友好相处的热切愿望，两国政府今后仍将采取必要措施来维护和巩固普遍和平和国际安全，并且以不分社会经济制度的国家和平共处的原则作为对外政策的基础。
    两国政府声明，由于国际反动力量对社会主义国家的猖狂破坏活动，迫切要求人民经常保持警惕，保持社会主义国家的团结，不断发展和加强社会主义阵营国家的兄弟关系。
    宣言揭露了美帝国主义者取代英法在中东殖民地位的企图。宣言说，苏阿两国政府完全支持中近东各国人民反对殖民主义、保卫自由、民族独立和主权的愿望和努力。
    苏阿两国政府声明，它们国家的人民衷心希望改善巴尔干各国之间的关系、扩大它们之间的全面联系和加强它们之间的信任。苏联政府赞同阿尔巴尼亚政府改善同希腊以及同意大利的关系的努力。
    两国政府重申，它们愿意在真诚友好基础上改善和竭力发展同南斯拉夫的关系，并且表示相信，南斯拉夫也将努力这样做，现在在这方面许多事都要取决于南斯拉夫。
    宣言接着说，两国政府声明，巴尔干公约是南斯拉夫、希腊和土耳其三国的排他性军事集团，这一公约的存在不可能促进巴尔干半岛安定的建立，不可能不引起巴尔干其他各国人民对上述公约缔约国意图的某种不信任，而且，缔约国之一是北大西洋集团参加者，另一国既是北大西洋集团参加者，又是巴格达集团参加者，这就把巴尔干公约同这些侵略集团联系在一起了。
    宣言接着说，会谈期间全面讨论和研究了苏阿两国间的经济关系问题。双方指出，两国经济合作正在本着无产阶级国际主义、兄弟友谊、平等和互助原则发展。苏联政府决定取消阿尔巴尼亚欠苏联的三亿四千八百万卢布的债务，这笔债务等于以苏联贷款在阿尔巴尼亚建造的各项企业的总值。此外，还取消阿尔巴尼亚为支付苏联供应的各种装备和物资所借的贷款到1957年1月1日为止所结存的债务，这笔债务总额为七千四百万卢布。
    苏联政府为了帮助阿尔巴尼亚政府实现在最近若干年里发展农业和工业的措施，表示准备在1957年到1958年给阿尔巴尼亚以必要的技术援助。
    苏联从以前给予的贷款项下供给阿尔巴尼亚建设水电站用的全套装备，石油工业装备，拖拉机，农业机器和土壤改良装备。
    双方同意签订贸易和航海条约，国籍协定，就刑事案件和民事案件互相给予法律上的帮助的协定以及关于领事问题的条约。
