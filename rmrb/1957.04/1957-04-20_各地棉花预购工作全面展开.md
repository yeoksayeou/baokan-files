Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The 1957 cotton pre-purchase work has been fully launched. Beijing has overfulfilled the pre-purchase plan by 4%. In Hubei Province, which produces a large amount of cotton, most purchasing units have signed pre-purchase contracts with agricultural cooperatives. Ten counties in Jiangsu Province have completed their pre-purchases. Hebei Province has pre-purchased 1.3 million dan of ginned cotton. Shandong Province has completed 42% of its pre-purchase plan.

This year, in the process of cotton pre-purchase, all regions have paid close attention to mobilizing agricultural cooperative members to actively produce, and comprehensively realize pre-purchase contracts on the basis of increased production. Many agricultural cooperatives held member meetings to discuss how to ensure cotton production and how to fulfill contracts before signing pre-purchase contracts. The Gaozhuang Production Team of the Shicun Township Agricultural Cooperative in Guan County, Shandong Province, decided through member meetings to concentrate fertilization, changing the original plan of not applying manure to cotton fields to applying one cart of manure per mu to ensure increased cotton production. Purchasing units in various regions have also actively helped agricultural cooperatives take various measures to rationally use advance payments. In some areas of Shandong, Jiangsu, and other provinces, agricultural cooperatives used part of the deposit to purchase or pre-purchase manure and fodder from members, and implemented a method of pre-paying labor day remuneration for members who lacked labor and had livelihood difficulties. This not only took care of the members' living needs but also stimulated the members' enthusiasm for accumulating fertilizer and production. After the Fourteenth Production Team of the Jianguo Agricultural Cooperative in Hegou Township, Shanghe County, Shandong Province, arranged farm work through pre-purchase, more than 90% of the labor force participated in production.

Regarding the phenomenon of some cotton fields being reduced this year, some regions have made adjustments through pre-purchase in consultation with agricultural cooperatives. For example, in Danyang County, Jiangsu Province, the state's cotton field target was 100,000 mu, but the initial plan of the agricultural cooperatives was only 71,000 mu. After consultation and adjustment with the agricultural cooperatives, it was increased to 98,500 mu, basically meeting the state's target requirements.

### 各地棉花预购工作全面展开

    各地棉花预购工作全面展开
    新华社19日讯　1957年度的棉花预购工作已经全面展开。北京市已经超额4％完成了预购计划。产棉较多的湖北省大部分地区采购单位都和农业社签订了预购合同。江苏省有十个县已经预购完毕。河北省已预购皮棉一百三十万担。山东省已经完成预购计划的42％。
    今年各地在棉花预购过程中，密切注意了发动农业社社员群众积极生产，在提高生产的基础上全面实现预购合同。很多农业社在签订预购合同以前，召开社员会议讨论如何保证棉花生产和如何履行合同等问题。山东省冠县史村乡农业社高庄生产队通过社员会议讨论，决定集中施肥，把原定棉田不上粪的计划改为每亩上一车粪，以保证棉花增产。各地采购单位还积极帮助农业社采取各种措施来合理使用预付定金。山东、江苏等省有些地区的农业社以一部分定金购买或预购社员的粪肥和饲草，并对缺乏劳动力和生活困难的社员实行预付劳动日报酬的办法。这样，既照顾了社员的生活需要，又刺激了社员积肥生产的积极性。山东省商河县河沟乡建国农业社第十四生产队通过预购安排农活后，90％以上的劳动力参加了生产。
    对今年出现的一些棉田缩减的现象，有些地区通过预购，同农业社协商作了调整。如江苏省丹阳县，国家提出的棉田指标是十万亩，最初农业社规划只有七万一千亩，经与农业社协商调整后增加到九万八千五百亩，基本上达到了国家的指标要求。
