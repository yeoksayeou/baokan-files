    National Party Disciplinary Inspection Work Conference Concludes
    Reviews and Summarizes Last Year's Party Disciplinary Inspection Work, and Determines This Year's Disciplinary Inspection Tasks, Based on the Spirit of the Party's "Eighth National Congress" and Chairman Mao's Speech at the Supreme State Conference
    (Our Newspaper Dispatch) The Second National Party Disciplinary Inspection Work Conference was held in Beijing from March 13th to 30th. Forty-nine people attended the meeting, including the secretaries and deputy secretaries of the Party Discipline Inspection Committees of various provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, six province-level cities, central state organs, and the People's Liberation Army. The conference, based on the spirit of the Party's Eighth National Congress and Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference, reviewed and summarized the Party's disciplinary inspection work in 1956, analyzed and studied the current situation of violations of Party discipline, and determined the tasks for the Party's disciplinary inspection work in 1957.
    The conference first listened to a recording of Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference and discussed it in light of the work situation in various regions. During the discussion, everyone unanimously agreed that in 1956, the local discipline inspection commissions successively conveyed the resolutions and spirit of the First National Party Disciplinary Inspection Work Conference convened by the Central Discipline Inspection Commission of the CPC, the symposium on Party discipline inspection work in industrial, mining, transportation and capital construction departments, and the symposium on case investigation and handling work. They criticized the right-leaning conservative thinking and the somewhat punitive style that were prevalent within the Party at the time in the enforcement of Party discipline. This was a profound disciplinary education for all Party comrades and also improved the policy and ideological level of discipline inspection cadres. At the same time, through the dissemination of these meetings, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of Party members and the masses in fighting against illegal and undisciplined behavior was also encouraged, thereby exposing a large number of cases of violations of Party discipline. With regard to these cases of violations of Party discipline, the local discipline inspection commissions, under the leadership of the local Party committees, generally conducted serious handling in accordance with the Party's policy of "seriousness, prudence, and differentiation." Those counter-revolutionary elements who had infiltrated the Party, class dissidents who persisted in splitting activities within the Party, and other incorrigible corrupt and degenerate elements were resolutely expelled from the Party after investigation and verification. This further purified the Party organization. Comrades who made mistakes in their work due to ideological errors, or who made mistakes due to poor ideological quality, were generally handled in accordance with the principles of "learning from past mistakes to avoid future ones, and curing the sickness to save the patient," "clarifying thinking and uniting comrades," and "if the mistakes committed can still be corrected within the Party, and the person concerned is willing to correct them, they should be given the opportunity to remain in the Party and correct them." Some were not given punishment, and some were given punishment; the vast majority of these punishments were correct. This shows that the Party's disciplinary inspection work in 1956 was successful and basically implemented the Party's policy towards errors within the Party. The claim that the Party's disciplinary inspection work violated the spirit of the "Eighth National Congress" and committed punitive errors is unfounded.
    However, on the other hand, the conference also believed that because some discipline inspection cadres still had undesirable work styles of subjectivism and bureaucratism, some cases were not handled correctly. This was mainly due to inappropriately increasing the punishment of Party members, or giving punishment to those who should not have been punished, or expelling those who should not have been expelled from the Party. At the same time, there was still some degree of laxity in discipline within the Party, with some cases that should have been handled not being handled, and some Party members who should have been punished not being punished. However, these deviations and errors in the work were only individual and few, and compared with the achievements in the work, they only occupied a secondary position. Therefore, the conference believed that sufficient estimation must be made of the achievements, and one should not become pessimistic and frustrated upon seeing individual deviations and errors; however, one should not fail to pay attention to inspecting and correcting shortcomings and errors just because the shortcomings and errors are secondary. The conference requested that the local discipline inspection commissions, in the spirit of seeking truth from facts and being seriously responsible, conduct individual and focused re-examinations of cases through inspection and summary of work. Those who fall under one of the following circumstances should be corrected: the facts of Party members' mistakes were mistaken, punishment was given to those who should not have been punished, the original punishment should be revoked; those who should not have been expelled from the Party were expelled, appropriate punishment should be given again according to the facts of the mistakes, or the punishment should be waived. Cases that should have been handled but were not handled should also be handled in order to uphold Party discipline. When inspecting and correcting deviations and errors in the work, attention should be paid to summing up experiences and lessons in order to improve the level of discipline inspection work and strive to avoid or reduce errors in future work.
    The conference believed that, in accordance with the spirit of the Party's "Eighth National Congress" and the Eighth Central Committee's Second Plenary Session's instructions on launching the campaign to increase production and practice economy, and in view of the fact that there are still a considerable number of violations of Party discipline within the Party, in order to guarantee the victorious completion of the final annual plan of the first Five-Year Plan from the perspective of the Party's disciplinary inspection work, the focus of the Party's disciplinary inspection work in 1957 should be on: opposing bureaucratism, commandism, and illegal and undisciplined behavior that does not care about the suffering of the people, seriously damages the interests of the state and the people, and destroys the ties between the Party and the people; opposing embezzlement, theft, corruption, degeneration, fabrication, deception and concealment; opposing suppressing democracy, retaliating, fighting for power and profit, and undermining Party unity.
    The conference believed that, in order to further improve the Party's disciplinary inspection work and correctly implement the policy of "seriousness, prudence, and differentiation" in handling errors within the Party, it is necessary to organize discipline inspection cadres to further study the documents of the Party's "Eighth National Congress," especially the parts related to the Party's disciplinary inspection work, and thoroughly clarify the guidelines and tasks of the Party's disciplinary inspection work; it is necessary to organize discipline inspection cadres to study Marxist-Leninist philosophy and overcome subjectivism and one-sidedness in thinking; it is necessary to strengthen guidance to the disciplinary inspection work of grassroots Party organizations and widely carry out discipline education within the Party; it is necessary to further implement the system of combining collective leadership and individual responsibility in disciplinary inspection organs, advocate that leading cadres regularly go deep into reality, conduct investigations and research, inspect and patrol work, oppose individual decisions on major issues, and oppose the bureaucratic work style of only relying on meeting reports to guide work and handle cases.

    全国党的监察工作会议闭幕
    根据党的“八大”和毛主席在最高国务会议上讲话的精神
    检查总结了去年党的监察工作，确定了今年监察工作的任务
    本报讯　第二次全国党的监察工作会议，于3月13日到30日在北京举行，出席会议的有各省、市、自治区和六个省属市以及中央国家机关、解放军党的监委书记和副书记等四十九人。会议根据党的第八次全国代表大会和毛主席在最高国务会议上讲话的精神，检查总结了1956年党的监察工作，分析研究了当前党内违反党纪的情况，确定了1957年党的监察工作的任务。
    会议首先听了毛主席在最高国务会议上讲话的录音，并联系各地工作的情况进行了讨论。在讨论中大家一致认为，1956年各地监委先后传达了中共中央监委召开的第一次全国党的监察工作会议、工矿交通基本建设部门党的监察工作座谈会和案件审查处理工作座谈会的决议和精神，批判了当时党内普遍存在的在执行党纪上的右倾保守思想和某种程度的惩办主义作风，这对全党同志是一次深刻的纪律教育，也提高了监察干部的政策思想水平。同时通过对这些会议的传达，还鼓励了广大党员、群众同违法乱纪行为作斗争的积极性，从而揭发了大批违反党纪的案件。对于这些违反党纪的案件，各地监委在当地党委的领导之下，一般都按照党的“严肃谨慎、区别对待”的方针作了认真的处理。对于凡属混进党内的反革命分子、在党内坚持分裂活动的阶级异己分子和其他不可救药的腐化堕落分子，在经过调查证实以后，都坚决地予以清除出党。这就进一步纯洁了党的组织。对于由于思想认识上有错误而在工作上犯错误的同志，或者由于思想品质不好而犯了错误的同志，一般都本着“惩前毖后，治病救人”、“既要弄清思想，又要团结同志”、“所犯错误还可以留在党内改正，本人也愿意改正，就给以留在党内改正的机会”的原则作了处理。其中有一部分没有给予处分，有一部分给了处分；这些处分，绝大多数都是正确的。这就说明，1956年党的监察工作是有成绩的，基本上执行了党对待党内错误的方针。那种认为党的监察工作违背了“八大”精神，犯了惩办主义错误的说法，是没有根据的。
    但在另一方面，会议也认为，由于部分监察干部还存在着主观主义和官僚主义的不良作风，因而也有部分案件处理得不正确。这主要是不适当地加重了党员的处分，或者不该处分的给予了处分，不该开除党籍的开除了。同时党内也还有某种程度的纪律松弛现象，有些该处理的案件没有处理，该处分的党员没有处分。但是，工作中的这些偏差和错误只是个别的、少数的，同工作中的成绩比较起来，只占次要地位。因此，会议认为必须对成绩作足够的估计，不要看见个别偏差和错误就产生消极沮丧情绪；但也不应因为缺点和错误是次要的，就不注意检查纠正。会议要求各地监委本着实事求是和严肃负责的精神，通过对工作的检查总结，个别地、有重点地对案件进行复查。凡有下列情形之一者，就应当纠正：把党员犯错误的事实搞错了，不该给予处分的处分了，应当撤消原处分；不该开除党籍的开除了，应当根据犯错误的事实，重新给予恰当的处分，或者免予处分。对于应当处理而没有处理的案件也要处理，以严肃党的纪律。在检查纠正工作中的偏差和错误时，要注意总结经验教训，以提高监察工作的水平，求得在今后的工作中不犯或少犯错误。
    会议认为，根据党的“八大”精神和八届二中全会关于开展增产节约运动的指示，并鉴于目前党内仍然存在着相当多的违反党纪的现象，为了从党的监察工作方面保证第一个五年计划最后一个年度计划的胜利完成，1957年党的监察工作的重点应当放在：反对不关心人民群众疾苦、严重损害国家和人民利益、破坏党和人民群众联系的官僚主义、命令主义和违法乱纪行为；反对贪污盗窃、腐化堕落、弄虚作假、欺骗隐瞒行为；反对压制民主、打击报复、争权夺利、破坏党的团结的行为。
    会议认为，为了进一步作好党的监察工作，正确执行处理党内错误的“严肃谨慎、区别对待”的方针，必须组织监察干部进一步学习党的“八大”文件，特别是其中有关党的监察工作的部分，彻底弄清党的监察工作的方针和任务；必须组织监察干部学习马克思列宁主义的哲学，克服思想上的主观性和片面性；必须加强对基层党组织监察工作的指导，并广泛地在党内开展纪律教育；必须进一步在监察机关中执行集体领导和个人负责相结合的制度，提倡领导干部经常深入实际、调查研究、检查巡视工作，反对个人决定重大问题，反对仅凭会议汇报来指导工作和处理案件的官僚主义作风。
