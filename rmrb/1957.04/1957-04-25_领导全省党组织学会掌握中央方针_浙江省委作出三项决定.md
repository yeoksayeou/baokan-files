Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, April 22nd: The Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a plenary meeting from the 15th to the 19th of April to discuss Chairman Mao's speech on the correct handling of contradictions among the people at the Supreme State Conference and Chairman Mao's speech at the National Propaganda Work Conference.

The meeting decided: First, Chairman Mao's speeches should be communicated level by level to cadres of urban and rural grassroots Party organizations; Party leading organs above the county level should study the speeches. In the course of study, it is necessary to link with the situation of handling contradictions among the people in the past in this region and unit, conscientiously sum up experiences and lessons, in order to improve understanding from practical experience, effectively overcome subjectivism, bureaucracy, and sectarianism in work style, and use this to educate subordinate organizations and cadres.

Second, the prefectural and county committees should pay attention to summing up and promoting good typical experiences in running cooperatives diligently and thriftily and democratically. Doing a good job in running cooperatives diligently and thriftily and democratically is precisely the most fundamental way to solve various contradictions in agricultural cooperatives. Relevant provincial-level agencies and local prefectural committees should study the problems in agricultural cooperatives with lagging work, distinguish the nature of the contradictions existing in these agricultural cooperatives, and help them reverse the situation in batches. Urban party committees should conscientiously study how to improve the democratic management of factories and enterprises, and further mobilize the enthusiasm of workers to carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy.

Third, Party committees at all levels should strengthen political and ideological work among the masses, pay close attention to the ideological trends of the masses, give lectures to workers and students frequently, carry out propaganda to peasants, and improve the political consciousness of the masses. Party committees at all levels must take this work as their primary responsibility; the first secretary of the Party committee must personally lead ideological work and intellectual work.

    领导全省党组织学会掌握中央方针
    浙江省委作出三项决定
    据新华社杭州22日电　中共浙江省委15日到19日举行全体会议，讨论了毛主席在最高国务会议上关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的讲话以及毛主席在全国宣传工作会议上的讲话。
    会议决定：第一，把毛主席的讲话逐级传达到城乡基层党组织的干部中去；县级以上党的领导机关要对讲话进行学习。在学习中要联系本地区、本单位过去处理人民内部矛盾的情况，认真总结经验教训，以便从实践经验中提高认识，切实克服作风上的主观主义、官僚主义和宗派主义，并以此教育下级组织和干部。
    第二，地委和县委应当在勤俭办社和民主办社方面，注意总结和推广好的典型经验。搞好勤俭办社和民主办社，这正是从最根本的方面去解决农业社中的各种矛盾的方法。省级有关机关和各地委要研究工作落后的农业社中的问题，分清这类农业社存在的矛盾的性质，分批帮助他们扭转局面。城市党委应该认真研究如何改进工厂企业的民主管理，进一步发挥职工群众开展增产节约运动的积极性。
    第三，各级党委应当加强群众中的政治思想工作，密切地注意群众的思想动态，经常向工人、学生作讲演，向农民作宣传，提高群众的政治觉悟。各级党委要将这一工作作为自己的首要职责；党委第一书记必须亲自领导思想工作和知识分子工作。
