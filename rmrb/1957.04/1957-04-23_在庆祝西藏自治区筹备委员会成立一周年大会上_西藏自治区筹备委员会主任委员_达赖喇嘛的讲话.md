Comrades, Compatriots:

The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region has been established for a year today. At this celebration meeting, I extend my warm congratulations to everyone!

Since the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, not only have the fourteen departments, commissions, and offices under its jurisdiction been established one after another, but also eight base-level offices and more than fifty Dzong-level offices have been established in various places. In terms of religious affairs, in order to implement the central government's policy of freedom of religious belief, protect lama temples, and strengthen unity among various religious sects, the Religious Affairs Committee and the mass organization of religious circles, the Tibet Branch of the Buddhist Association of China, have been established, laying a good foundation for the establishment of a Tibet Autonomous regime with flourishing politics and religion. In terms of economic and cultural construction, the number of middle and primary schools has now increased to seventy-nine, with a total of more than 6,000 students. Whether engaging in political or religious affairs, a certain level of cultural attainment is indispensable. After mastering this tool well, one can engage in political or religious affairs according to one's own wishes. In terms of medicine and health, in addition to establishing medical and health institutions in agricultural and pastoral areas, many medical teams have also been organized to conduct mobile medical services, which have greatly benefited the relief of pain and the enhancement of people's physical fitness. In terms of transportation, the Lhasa-Yatung and Lhasa-Tsetang highways have been completed and opened to traffic. In addition, trial runs have been carried out on the Heihe-Ali line, and the Heihe-Tingri highway is under construction. During this period, not only has land transportation in Tibet been developed, but also air routes from Beijing to Lhasa and from Lhasa across the Himalayas to India have been opened, making land and air transportation in Tibet much more convenient. In terms of industrial construction, the Lhasa Hydropower Plant, the Shigatse Thermal Power Plant, the Lhasa Automobile Repair Plant, the Anduoduo Coal Mine, etc., have been built or are under construction, and most of them have been put into production. In order to develop agriculture and animal husbandry, in addition to issuing agricultural and animal husbandry loans, a large number of agricultural tools have been purchased and distributed, and livestock have been vaccinated. In order to solve the problem of some medicines locally, the Lhasa Serum Factory has produced and supplied a large number of serums, and has done a lot of work. In short, we have achieved considerable success in various tasks of building Tibet in the past year. These achievements have been achieved under the correct leadership and strong assistance of the Communist Party of China, the great leader Chairman Mao, and the State Council, with the active support of all ethnic groups, the close unity and active efforts of the People's Liberation Army and working comrades stationed in Tibet and the Tibetan people, and the joint efforts of the Tibetan monks and lay people.

While achieving the above-mentioned achievements, some shortcomings and mistakes have also occurred in our work. This is reflected in the resolutions passed by the Standing Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the Autonomous Region. Some resolutions encountered difficulties in actual implementation or could not be implemented because they were not carefully considered in advance. For example, regarding the gradual reduction of the prices of daily necessities for the Tibetan people, because Tibet's agricultural and pastoral areas suffered widespread droughts last year, the harvests of agriculture and animal husbandry were not very good, and various conditions were not available. Therefore, when the prices of people's daily necessities, mainly grain and butter, gradually increased, no improvements were made to this situation. Regarding the establishment of Dzong-level offices, the intention and benefits of establishing Dzong-level offices were not clearly explained to the people in various places, so people in some areas had doubts and Dzong-level offices were not established. Even those that had been established had various shortcomings, such as too many staff members and the failure to properly integrate with local customs and people's thinking in the implementation of various tasks. In addition, the Tibet Cadre School and various places, in absorbing and training cadres, overemphasized quantity, which resulted in the phenomenon of being sent on errands, arousing dissatisfaction among the people, and absorbing some personnel who had no prospects for training. At the same time, a small number of Han cadres who had newly arrived in Tibet, because they did not understand the actual situation in Tibet and did not study ethnic policies well, had shortcomings and mistakes in their work, such as not being able to integrate well with local customs and habits. Some Tibetan cadres did not clearly realize that the work of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region was their own work, so they did not actively work hard. Some cadres of local governments used the small amount of work they were responsible for in the local government as an excuse not to frequently come to the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region to take on their work. As for the work of the local government, they used their position in the Preparatory Committee of the Autonomous Region as an excuse to take it easy between the two. This situation was not promptly checked, corrected, and controlled, which is also a shortcoming in our work. In particular, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region is an organization with national characteristics that realizes the right to be masters of one's own affairs, but there are various different views on it. This is because we have not fully appreciated the national form and have not well integrated it with the customs and habits of our own nation. We have already taken measures to begin to correct the above-mentioned shortcomings and mistakes, and we will continue to take measures to achieve the goal of thorough correction.

As for future work, in addition to resolutely correcting the above-mentioned shortcomings and mistakes, we must also improve the various organs under the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region through adjustments. Whether the Preparatory Committee of the Autonomous Region implements the policy of freedom of religious belief, protects temples, or carries out other large and small tasks, it must be based on the premise of flourishing politics and religion and benefiting the monks and lay people. It is hoped that the Han comrades will follow the intentions of the Communist Party of China and the great leader Chairman Mao, closely unite with Tibetan cadres and all the monks and lay people, and integrate well with local customs and the actual situation, provide strong assistance in various tasks, and vigorously help Tibetan cadres improve their knowledge level, loyally serve the Tibetan people. It is hoped that all Tibetan cadres will closely unite with the Han comrades, successfully complete the tasks they are responsible for, gradually accumulate experience, work hard to study, gradually improve the patriotic, altruistic thinking and knowledge level, so that when the autonomous region that embodies the characteristics of the Tibetan nationality is formally established in the future, they will be able to happily and competently undertake the various tasks they should be responsible for, and that all of this will work to promote the flourishing of Buddhism, which marks the characteristics of this Buddha land. What I want to say today ends here. If there are any shortcomings and mistakes, I hope you will frankly point them out.

Finally, we shout:

Long live the source of happiness, the flourishing of Buddhism!

Long live the great unity between the brotherly nationalities of China, especially the Han and Tibetan nationalities!

Long live the Communist Party of China!

Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the people of all ethnic groups in China!

I wish the various tasks of the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region success!

    在庆祝西藏自治区筹备委员会成立一周年大会上
    西藏自治区筹备委员会主任委员
    达赖喇嘛的讲话
    同志们，同胞们：西藏自治区筹备委员会成立到今天已经一周年了，在这个庆祝大会上，我向大家致以热烈的祝贺！
    西藏自治区筹备委员会成立后，不仅所属十四个厅、委、处相继成立起来，而且在各地成立了八个基巧级办事处和五十多个宗级办事处；在宗教事务方面，为了执行中央所制定的宗教信仰自由政策，保护喇嘛寺庙，加强各教派之间的团结，成立了宗教事务委员会，和宗教界的群众团体——中国佛教协会西藏分会，为建立政教昌隆的西藏自治政权打下了良好的基础。在经济和文化的建设方面，到现在中学和小学发展到七十九所，学生总共约有六千多人。无论从事政治或宗教事务，都不能不具备一定的文化水准。很好地掌握了这个工具以后，就可以按照自己的意愿，从事政治或宗教事务。在医药卫生方面，除了在农牧各地成立了医疗卫生机构以外，还组织了很多医疗小组，进行巡回医疗，这些对解除疾病痛苦，增强人民体质获得了很大好处。在交通方面，先后修成了拉萨到亚东，和拉萨到泽当的公路，并已通车；此外，在黑河到阿里的线上，进行了试车；并正在修筑黑河到丁青的公路。在此期间，不仅发展了西藏的陆上交通，而且在空运方面开辟了北京到拉萨，和从拉萨越过喜马拉雅山到印度的航线，至此西藏的陆空交通都有了很大的方便。在工业建设方面，建成或正在建设拉萨水力发电厂、日喀则火力发电厂、拉萨汽车修配厂、安多多马煤矿等，绝大部分均已投入生产。为了发展农牧业，除了发放农牧业贷款以外，购运并发放了大批的农具，给牲畜注射防疫针；为了部分药品就地解决，拉萨血清厂生产和供应了大批血清等做了不少的工作。总之，一年来我们在建设西藏的各项工作上获得了相当的成绩。这些成绩的获得是在中国共产党、伟大的领袖毛主席和国务院的正确领导并大力帮助下，在各族人民的积极支援，进藏人民解放军和工作同志与西藏人们间亲密团结，积极努力，以及西藏僧俗人民共同努力的结果。
    我们在获得上述成绩的同时，在工作中也发生了一些缺点和错误。这表现在自治区筹委会常务委员会所通过的决议中，有些决议由于事先没有能够进行慎重周详的考虑，在实际执行中遇到困难或没有能够执行。例如，关于逐步降低西藏人民生活用品的价格问题，由于去年西藏农牧各地普遍遭受干旱，农牧收成都不太好，各方面的条件也不具备，因而在以粮食和酥油为主的人民日用必需品的价格逐渐上涨的时候，对这种情况没有能够加以改善；关于成立宗级办事处的问题，也由于把成立宗级办事处的用意和好处没有向各地人民解释清楚，因而有些地区的人民发生了疑虑，没有成立宗级办事处，就是已经成立的宗级办事处，也由于工作人员过多，并在各项工作的进行中，出现了不能很好地结合当地的风俗习惯和人民的思想情况等各种缺点。此外，西藏干部学校和各地在吸收培养干部中，由于过分地追求了数量，因而出现了派差现象，引起人民的不满，并吸收了一些没有培养前途的人员，同时有少数新来西藏的汉族干部，由于不明了西藏的实际情况，没有很好地学习民族政策，因而在工作中出现了不能很好地结合当地风俗习惯的缺点和错误。少数藏族干部由于没有明确认识到西藏自治区筹备委员会的工作就是西藏自己的工作，因而不积极努力。有些地方政府的干部，以自己在地方政府中担负的少许工作为借口，不经常到自治区筹备委员会来担负自己的工作。而对地方政府的工作，也以在自治区筹备委员会的职务为借口，在此两者之间偷闲自在。对于这种情况，也没有及时地通过检查，加以纠正和掌握，这也是我们工作上的缺点。尤其西藏自治区筹备委员会是具有民族形式的、实现当家作主的权利的组织，但是竟有各种不同的看法，这是由于我们还没有完全体会民族形式，和没有很好地结合本民族的风俗习惯所致。对于上述这些缺点和错误，我们已经采取措施开始纠正，我们要继续采取措施以达到彻底纠正的目的。
    至于今后的工作，我们除了坚决地纠正上述的缺点和错误以外，还要对西藏自治区筹备委员会所属各机关通过调整使之健全；自治区筹备委员会无论在执行宗教信仰自由政策，保护寺庙，或进行其他大小工作，都要以政教昌隆，和对僧俗人民有利为前提；希望汉族工作同志们，一本中国共产党和伟大领袖毛主席的意图，紧密地团结藏族干部和全体僧俗人民，很好地结合当地的风俗习惯和实际情况，在各项工作上予以大力帮助，并大力帮助藏族干部提高他们的知识水平，忠心耿耿地为西藏人民服务。希望所有藏族干部紧密地团结汉族工作同志，很好地完成自己所担负的工作任务，逐渐积累经验，努力学习，逐步提高爱国、利他的思想和知识水平，为在以后正式成立体现西藏民族特点的自治区时，能够愉快胜任自己所应担负的各项工作，并且这一切为促使标志着这个佛地特征的佛教得以昌隆而努力。今天我所要讲的话就此结束了，如果有什么缺点和错误，希望很坦率地予以指正。
    最后我们高呼：
    幸福的根源佛教昌隆万岁！
    中国各兄弟民族间，特别是汉藏民族间伟大团结万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    中国各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
    祝西藏自治区筹备委员会的各项工作胜利！
