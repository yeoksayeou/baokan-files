The Sixth Fleet Ordered to Eastern Mediterranean
U.S. Blatantly Interfering in Jordanian Situation
New Government Adopts Terror Tactics Nabelsi and Others Arrested

    This newspaper reports that the United States, in order to intensify the tension in the Middle East, is openly interfering in the Jordanian political crisis. The U.S. Department of Defense announced on the 25th that the ships of the U.S. Sixth Fleet, currently operating off the coasts of France and Italy, had been ordered to sail to the Eastern Mediterranean on the 25th. Defense Department officials said that once the Sixth Fleet reaches the Eastern Mediterranean, a portion of the ships may go near the Lebanese port closest to Jordan. U.S. news agencies admit that the intent of the U.S. action "is to place a huge U.S. combat force near the crisis-ridden nation of Jordan" in order to "help King Hussein at this moment of crisis." U.S. officials said that the Sixth Fleet sailing to the Eastern Mediterranean is "a show of force" and "lays the foundation for fully implementing the Eisenhower Doctrine if necessary." Some newspapers in Paris also commented that the deployment of the U.S. Sixth Fleet is a "saber-rattling act" similar to "Anglo-American interference in Egypt," and the United States may engage in "a planned adventure" in order to "test its strength in this region."

    The British government is also showing eagerness regarding the situation in Jordan. A British Foreign Office spokesman said on the 25th that Britain is concerned about Jordan's "independence and integrity." Britain is consulting with the governments of the United States, France, Israel, and the member states of the Baghdad Pact, namely Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Pakistan, regarding the situation in Jordan. London diplomatic circles believe that the British Foreign Office spokesman's remarks, and U.S. President Eisenhower's earlier statement on the situation in Jordan, are tantamount to inviting King Hussein of Jordan to request assistance from the two countries in maintaining his throne.

    Within Jordan, the entire country is currently under martial law, and the atmosphere is even more tense. Since the early morning of the 25th, curfews have been imposed in cities such as Amman, Jerusalem, and Nablus. Cairo Radio reported that large numbers of military police are patrolling the streets of Amman and have installed barbed wire. According to United Press International, since the rise of the Hashim cabinet, former Prime Minister Nabulsi and other leaders of leftist parties, as well as some Jordanian army officers, have been arrested, and four officers have been murdered. Air transport and telecommunications between Jordan and Lebanon have also been suspended. It is reported that the Saudi Arabian forces, which have long been stationed in Jordan, have been transferred to Nablus, the Palestinian center on the West Bank of the Jordan River, and have surrounded the city. At the same time, there are reports that Iraqi "volunteer" armored forces have also entered positions between Amman and the Syrian border.

    According to news from Jerusalem, all Americans, including diplomatic personnel, were evacuated from the Jordanian section of Jerusalem on the 25th, and United Press International "anticipates" that "serious disturbances may occur" there.

    Currently, the Jordanian people's opposition to the "Eisenhower Doctrine" remains very high. In order to ease the people's anti-American sentiment, King Hussein of Jordan stated in a speech on the 25th that his country has no intention of accepting the "Eisenhower Doctrine" and is not prepared to invite Richards to visit Jordan.

    According to a U.S. State Department announcement on April 25, Secretary of State Dulles has decided to temporarily suspend President Eisenhower's special envoy Richards' visit to the Middle East. Richards will go to West Germany to hold talks with Dulles in Bonn, who is preparing to attend the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Ministerial Council meeting to be held from May 2 to 4.

    Sources say that U.S. officials have always hoped that Richards could visit Jordan, but due to the anti-American sentiment of the Jordanian people, the State Department is concerned that a visit at this time is "inopportune."

    In other news, Syrian President Kuwatli arrived in Cairo from Damascus on the 25th to hold talks with Egyptian President Nasser on the situation in Jordan.

    On the morning of the 26th, Syrian President Kuwatli and an Egyptian delegation dispatched by Egyptian President flew from Cairo to Saudi Arabia to hold talks with the Saudi King on the situation in Jordan and the Middle East. Members of the Egyptian delegation included Anwar Sadat, Secretary-General of the Islamic Congress, Ali Sabri, Director of the Political Bureau of the Egyptian Presidential Palace, and Bakouri, Minister of Religious Endowments.

    第六舰队奉命开往东地中海
    美国明目张胆干涉约旦局势
    新政府采恐怖手段  纳布西等横遭逮捕
    本报讯  美国为加剧中东紧张局势，正在对约旦政治危机进行公开的干涉。美国国防部25日宣布，目前在法国海面和意大利海面活动的美国第六舰队的舰只，25日已经奉命驶往东地中海。国防部的官员说，只要第六舰队到达东地中海，其中的一批舰只就可能去靠近约旦的黎巴嫩港口。美国通讯社承认，美国采取这个行动的意图，“是要把一支巨大的美国战斗力量放在靠近危机重重的约旦国家的地方”，以“在这个危机时刻帮助国王侯赛因”。美国官员说，第六舰队驶往东地中海是“炫耀力量”，是“为在必要时把艾森豪威尔主义全部实行起来打下基础”。巴黎的一些报纸评论也写道，美国第六舰队的出动，是同“英美干涉埃及”一样的“剑客行动”，美国可能进行“有计划的冒险”，以便“在这个地区试验一下力量”。
    英国政府对约旦局势也表示跃跃欲试。英国外交部发言人25日说，英国关心约旦的“独立和完整”。英国正在就约旦局势同美国、法国、以色列和巴格达条约组织的成员国伊拉克、伊朗、土耳其和巴基斯坦各国政府进行商谈。伦敦外交界人士认为，英国外交部发言人的谈话和美国总统艾森豪威尔在这以前发表的关于约旦局势的声明，无异于邀请约旦国王侯赛因要求两国帮助他保持王位。
    在约旦国内，目前全国正处于戒严状态，气氛更加紧张。从25日清晨起，安曼、耶路撒冷、纳布鲁斯等城市实行宵禁。开罗电台报道，大批军警在安曼街道上巡逻，并且已经安置了铁丝网。据合众社消息，哈希姆内阁上台以后，前首相纳布西和其他一些左翼政党领袖以及一些约旦陆军军官都已被逮捕，有四个军官被谋杀。约旦和黎巴嫩之间的空运和电讯也已中断。据悉，早已驻在约旦的沙特阿拉伯军队已被调到约旦河西岸的巴勒斯坦中心地纳布鲁斯，并包围了这一城市。同时有消息说，伊拉克的“志愿”装甲部队也已经开入了安曼和叙利亚边境之间的阵地。
    另据耶路撒冷消息，所有美国人，包括外交人员在内，已于25日撤出了耶路撒冷的约旦区，合众社“预料”那里“可能发生严重的骚乱”。
    目前约旦人民反对“艾森豪威尔主义”的情绪仍然十分高涨。约旦国王侯赛因为了缓和人民的反美情绪，在25日发表的演说中表示，他的国家无意接受“艾森豪威尔主义”，并且不准备邀请理查兹访问约旦。
    据美国国务院4月25日宣布，国务卿杜勒斯已经决定暂时中断总统特使理查兹在中东的访问。理查兹将到西德去，以便在波恩同准备参加5月2日到4日举行的北大西洋公约组织部长理事会会议的杜勒斯举行会谈。
    有消息说，美国官方一直希望理查兹能访问约旦，但是由于约旦人民的反美情绪，国务院担心目前去访问“不合时宜”。
    又讯　叙利亚总统库阿特利25日从大马士革到达开罗，就约旦局势同埃及总统纳赛尔进行了会谈。
    26日早晨，叙利亚总统库阿特利同埃及总统特派的一个埃及代表团从开罗乘飞机前往沙特阿拉伯，同沙特国王就约旦和中东局势举行会谈。埃及代表团的团员包括：伊斯兰大会秘书长安瓦尔·萨达特，埃及总统府政治局局长阿里·萨布里和宗教基金部长巴库里。
