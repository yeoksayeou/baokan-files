Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 23rd. The new university enrollment regulations recently approved by the Soviet Ministry of Higher Education stipulate that 60% of new students admitted in the future will be young men and women who have undergone labor training with more than two years of work experience.

The regulations stipulate some preferential admission conditions for these working youths. For example, young workers who have completed courses at schools for young workers and rural youth, as well as part-time correspondence secondary vocational schools, without leaving their jobs, will only be required to take one major course in the entrance examination; their admission age can be extended accordingly, and so on. In this way, many middle school graduates will enter production posts every year. They will enrich their knowledge and accumulate experience in actual production. Currently, a large number of middle school graduates have already responded to the call of the country and participated in the construction of many magnificent projects in Siberia and the Far East. Soviet education experts believe that sending middle school graduates to participate in production and gain practical experience before studying at university can further improve the quality of talent cultivated by universities.

Currently, relevant parties are organizing working youths in various regions who are preparing to take the exams to actively prepare for their lessons.

Not long ago, the Ukrainian Ministry of Higher Education had already organized various tutoring classes with the participation of more than 5,000 working youths. The longest of these tutoring classes lasts for five months, giving the young people ample opportunity to review various examination subjects. Many young people who came to reclaim wasteland in Kazakhstan and Altai from Moscow and all over the country three years ago are reviewing their lessons in short-term tutoring classes every day after their intense fieldwork.

    经过劳动锻炼再入大学进修
    苏联劳动青年积极备课投考
    新华社莫斯科23日电　苏联高等教育部最近批准的新的高等学校招生章程规定，今后招收的60％的新生将是有两年以上工龄的受过劳动锻炼的青年男女。
    章程对这些劳动青年规定了一些优待的投考条件。例如，凡是在不脱产的情况下读完了青年工人和农村青年学校、以及业余函授中等专业学校课程的青年劳动者，在入学考试时只考一门主要的课程；他们的入学年龄得相应延长等等。这样，今后每年将有许多中学生在毕业后进入生产岗位。他们将在实际生产中充实自己的知识和积累经验。目前就已经有大批中学毕业生响应国家的号召，参加了西伯利亚和远东的许多宏伟工程的建设工作。苏联的教育专家们认为，中学毕业生在参加生产有了实际经验以后再读大学，更可以提高高等学校培养人才的质量。
    现在，有关方面正在组织各地准备投考的劳动青年积极备课。
    不久以前，乌克兰高等教育部已经组织了有五千多名劳动青年参加的各种补习班，这些补习班时间最长的是五个月，青年们有充分的机会来补习各种考试科目。许多在三年前从莫斯科和全国各地来到哈萨克和阿尔泰垦荒的青年，每天在紧张的田间工作以后都在短期补习班温习功课。
