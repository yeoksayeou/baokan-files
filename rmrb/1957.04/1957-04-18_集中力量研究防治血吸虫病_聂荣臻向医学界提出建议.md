Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Vice Premier of the State Council, Nie Rongzhen, suggested that the medical community should pay attention to cultivating academic centers for medical research, and at the same time, fully utilize the research capabilities of various higher medical colleges and medical and epidemic prevention institutions. For the struggle against diseases that currently endanger people's health, he suggested that the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis should be the primary focus. On the afternoon of the 11th, Nie Rongzhen met with the Medical Coordination Group of the State Council's Science Planning Commission in Beijing. After listening to a report on the coordination work, he made the above suggestions to the Chinese and Western medicine experts participating in the coordination.

Currently, the main national medical science research units include the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, the Academy of Military Medical Sciences, the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (formerly the Central Health Research Institute), and the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine. The research work is spread too thin, the forces are dispersed, there is a lack of cooperation, a large amount of manpower and material resources are wasted, and the development of research work is hindered. According to the preliminary coordination plan recently completed, the above-mentioned four units and the 96 research institutions under the Ministry of Health will be adjusted to 43. For example, in the research of radiological medicine, the army and the local authorities originally planned to set up institutions separately, but there were very few specialized talents in this area, which were not sufficient. Therefore, the research work could only be carried out after two or three years. After coordination, the army and the local authorities decided to jointly build an institution, which not only can concentrate manpower, but also save 900,000 yuan in basic construction costs, and the research work can start in the first half of next year.

The Medical Coordination Group has sorted out and reviewed the research projects proposed by medical research institutions across the country this year, merged duplicate topics, and selected schistosomiasis, malaria, filariasis, kala-azar, plague, epidemic encephalitis B, viral hepatitis, chronic dysentery, infantile indigestion, pulmonary tuberculosis, leprosy, poliomyelitis, measles, pertussis, scarlet fever, tularemia, Keshan disease, hypertension, atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, rheumatic heart disease, silicosis, lead poisoning, and benzene poisoning as the key research areas this year. In addition, research on antibiotics and drugs, translation of classical works of traditional Chinese medicine and compilation of TCM textbooks, improvement of production environment hygiene, birth control methods, and unified adjustment of food analysis and physical measurement methods have also been listed as key research projects.

The Science Planning Commission of the State Council has organized 26 groups to coordinate scientific research work across the country. Some have completed preliminary plans, and some are in progress. This coordination method has been warmly supported by the scientific community.

    集中力量研究防治血吸虫病
    聂荣臻向医学界提出建议
    新华社16日讯　国务院副总理聂荣臻建议医学界应注意培养医学研究的学术中心，同时应充分发挥各高等医学院校和各医疗防疫机构在研究方面的力量，对于当前危害人民健康的疾病的斗争，他建议应以血吸虫病的防治为首要的重点。11日下午，聂荣臻在北京接见了国务院科学规划委员会医学协调小组，听取了关于协调工作的汇报后，对参加协调的中西医学专家们提出了上述建议。
    目前全国性的主要医学科学研究单位有中国协和医学院、军事医学科学院、中国医学科学院（原中央卫生研究院）和中医研究院四个。研究工作摊子铺得很大，力量分散，互不协作，浪费了大量人力物力，并且阻碍了研究工作的开展。根据近日完成的初步协调方案，上述四个单位及卫生部所属的九十六个研究机构将调整为四十三个。如放射医学的研究，原先军队和地方准备各设机构，但这方面的专门人才极少，不敷使用，因此研究工作要在两、三年后才能开展。协调以后，军队和地方决定合建一个机构，不但人力可以集中使用，基本建设费用可节省九十万元，而且研究工作可以提前到明年上半年开始。
    医学协调小组对全国各医药研究机构提出的今年研究项目进行了整理和审查，合并了重复的题目，并且选出了血吸虫病、疟疾、血丝虫病、黑热病、鼠疫、流行性乙型脑炎、病毒性肝炎、慢性痢疾、小儿消化不良、肺结核、麻风、小儿麻痹症、麻疹、百日咳、猩红热、柳捌子病、克山病、高血压、动脉粥样化、冠状动脉病、风湿性心脏病、矽肺、铅中毒和苯中毒等二十多种疾病为今年研究重点。此外，抗生素和药物的研究，语译中医经典著作及编写中医教材，改善生产环境卫生，节育方法以及统一调整食物分析及体质测量方法的研究也被列为重点研究项目。
    国务院科学规划委员会对全国科学研究工作分别组织了二十六个小组进行协调。有的已经完成初步方案，有的正在进行。这种协调方法，得到科学界的热烈拥护。
