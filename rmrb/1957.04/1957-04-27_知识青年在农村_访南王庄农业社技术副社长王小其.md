    Educated Youth in the Countryside
    Visiting Wang Xiaoqi, Deputy Director of Technology at Nanwangzhuang Agricultural Cooperative
    Xinhua News Agency reporters Hao Xiulan and Zhang Lijun
    Reporters recently visited Wang Xiaoqi, Deputy Director of Technology at Nanwangzhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Anping County. He is one of the well-known members who insisted on establishing the cooperative with three poor peasant households. We asked him to talk about how educated youth in Nanwangzhuang village are playing a role in production.
      Determined to Run the Agricultural Cooperative Well
    Wang Xiaoqi said that there are a total of twenty-seven higher primary school graduates in their cooperative. This group of people produces and studies together with the members every day, living a plain but meaningful life. Everyone is determined to run the agricultural cooperative well. These young people not only see the present situation, but also think about the future. The agricultural cooperative is constantly developing, and the youth feel that their lives will have unlimited happiness. In order to strive for a bumper agricultural harvest this year, at the beginning of this year, Wang Xiaoqi led the entire cooperative to start more than sixty mu of high-yield fields and experimental fields, and further study agricultural technology. Wang Xiaoqi particularly emphasized: The prospect of rural development is bright, and the more it is, the more we feel the lack of manpower. He initially estimated that if all the planned work for this year is carried out, our cooperative will need to supplement at least thirty more educated youth.
        Agriculture Needs Culture
    Wang Xiaoqi said that culture is indispensable for modern agriculture. He recalled that in the early days when three poor peasant households insisted on running the cooperative, the cooperative lacked draught animals and farm tools, and faced many difficulties. At that time, he was the only one of the three, Wang Yukun and Wang Xiaopang, who could read. He often read aloud to everyone the policies on running cooperatives and the experience of running cooperatives in other regions from the newspapers. He learned new farming techniques for cotton, millet, and corn from newspapers and magazines and applied them to production. Later, they finally achieved increased production with the greatest perseverance. Wang Xiaoqi said excitedly that after their cooperative was changed to an advanced cooperative, higher requirements were put forward for agricultural technology reform. In order to ensure agricultural production increase, Wang Wuluan, a higher primary school graduate from 1954, was appointed as an insect pest prediction and forecasting officer for pest control. He records the occurrence of pests and diseases every day and has discovered pests and diseases such as corn borers, red spiders, and aphids, and carried out timely control. Last year, when the experience of sweet potato hotbed seedling cultivation was promoted in various production teams, technician and higher primary school graduate Wang Shucong quickly accepted advanced experience, and he and veteran agricultural technician Wang Laodai jointly created the highest record for sweet potato hotbed seedling cultivation in the entire cooperative. Now, among the twenty-two technicians in the entire cooperative, there are more than a dozen higher primary school graduates. Higher primary school graduates also work as accountants, civil school teachers, and library administrators.
    Participating in Labor is the Only Way to "Enter the Door"
    When talking about how educated youth can become familiar with production and establish prestige among the masses, Wang Xiaoqi said that starting from actual production is the only way to truly "enter the door" of agricultural work. After graduating from higher primary school in 1950, he was completely ignorant of farming. In the first few days of working in the fields, he could not hoe the land well, and he was so sore all over that his hands blistered. Even so, he endured the pain and humbly learned from others. After more than a year, he joined a mutual aid group. After another year or so, he initially grasped the general knowledge of production. Wang Xiaoqi said that he is still a member of the production team and participates in actual production. This is very necessary for him as a technology leader. Wang Qingmiao, a higher primary school graduate, has always insisted on labor and humbly learned from veteran farmers and technical cadres. Finally, she learned various farm tasks and new agricultural technologies. Now, she has been elected as the deputy director of the cooperative.
      Need to Continue to Improve Culture
    Wang Xiaoqi said that in actual work, we, the twenty-odd educated youth, have experienced that the biggest difficulty is still the lack of culture, and everyone urgently demands improvement. Now the cooperative is actively carrying out cultural learning. The youth in each production team have specially organized youth production groups to work and study together. They bring books to the fields and study whenever they have time. The middle-aged and young farmers also feel the pain of not having culture. Among the young and middle-aged illiterates in the entire village, 80% have already participated in civil school learning.

### 知识青年在农村  访南王庄农业社技术副社长王小其

    知识青年在农村
    访南王庄农业社技术副社长王小其
    新华社记者　郝秀岚　张丽君
    记者最近访问了安平县南王庄农业社技术副社长王小其。他就是著名的坚持三户贫农办社的成员之一。我们请他谈了南王庄村的在乡知识青年是怎样在生产中发挥作用的。
      决心办好农业社
    王小其说，他们社里共有二十七名高小毕业学生，他们这一伙人每天和社员们一起生产、学习，过着平凡而有意义的生活，每个人都有决心，一定要把农业社办好。这伙青年人不仅看到了现在这一切，也想到了将来。农业社在不停的发展，青年们都感到自己的生活将有无限幸福。为了争取今年农业大丰收，今年年初王小其就领导全社搞起了六十多亩丰产田和试验田，进一步钻研农业技术。王小其特别强调说：我们农村发展的远景是美好的，愈是这样，也就愈发感到人力的不足。他初步估算一下，今年计划的工作都作起来，我们社里起码还要补充三十几名知识青年。
        农业需要文化
    王小其说，文化对于现代的农业是不可缺少的。他回忆起三户贫农坚持办社的初期，社里缺耕畜，少农具，困难重重。当时，他和王玉坤、王小庞三人中就他一个人认字，他就时常把报上有关办社的政策和其他地区的办社经验读给大家听。从报纸上和杂志上学习有关棉花、谷子和玉米的新的耕作技术，用到生产上去，后来他们终于用了最大的毅力实现了增产。王小其兴奋地说，他们合作社改为高级社以后，对于农业技术改革提出了更高的要求。为了保证农业增产，在防治病虫害方面，由1954年的高小毕业生王五乱担任了虫情预测预报员。他每天要记录病虫害发生的情况，曾经发现过玉米钻心虫、红蜘蛛、蚜虫等病虫害，及时进行了除治。去年在各生产队推广白薯温床育苗的经验时，技术员、高小毕业生王树聪接受先进经验快，他和老农技术员王老带共同创造了白薯温床育苗的全社最高纪录。现在，全社二十二个技术员中，有十几个高小毕业生。高小毕业生还有担任会计、民校教师、图书馆管理员等工作。
    参加劳动才能“入门”
    谈到知识青年怎样熟悉生产，在群众中树立起威信的问题，王小其说，从实际生产作起才能真正在农活上“入门”。1950年他高小毕业后，对于种地完全是门外汉，下地的头几天地耪不好，还累得混身酸痛，手磨起了泡。这样，他还是忍着苦，同时虚心向别人学习，经过一年多时间，参加了互助组。又是一年多的时间，他才初步掌握了生产的一般知识。王小其说，他一直到现在仍然是生产队的一份子，参加实际生产。这对他这个领导技术来说十分必要。高小毕业生王清渺，一直坚持劳动，虚心向老农和技术干部学习，终于学会了各种农活和新的农业技术。现在，她已被选为副社长。
      需要继续提高文化
    王小其说，我们二十几个知识青年在实际工作中体验到，最大的困难仍然是文化不足，每个人都迫切地要求提高。现在社里正积极开展文化学习。每个生产队的青年专门组织了青年生产组，一起干活，一起学习，他们带着书本下地，有空就学，壮年农民也感到没有文化的苦处。全村青壮年文盲中，已经有80％参加了民校学习。
