　　This newspaper, Hangzhou, 25th. Reporter Liu Shiping reports: Premier Zhou Enlai welcomed Chairman Voroshilov at Hangzhou's Jianqiao Airport today. Before Chairman Voroshilov's plane arrived, Premier Zhou Enlai spoke with Rashidov, Vice Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Yelyutin, Minister of Higher Education of the Soviet Union, and Yudin, the Soviet Ambassador to China, about the issue of internal contradictions among the people and the opposition to bureaucracy.

　　The topic began with Premier Zhou Enlai introducing the scenery of West Lake to the distinguished guests.

　　Premier Zhou, holding a map of Hangzhou and smiling, said to the guests, "I have been to Hangzhou twice this year, so I can tell you a few things about it."

　　Comrade Rashidov then said, "It is always difficult for leading comrades to find time to travel around."

　　Premier Zhou said, "Yes, we should go to various places more often. Staying in Beijing all the time will lead to bureaucracy. The walls of Beijing are high, which easily separates leaders from the masses."

　　Rashidov jokingly said, "High walls also have a benefit: they prevent bureaucracy from spreading."

　　Premier Zhou smiled and said, "There is another benefit: if the masses oppose bureaucracy, the walls can hold them off for a while. However, this is still not foolproof. The walls can be breached. Nearly forty years ago, our Beijing students stormed the ancient city of Beijing to oppose the bureaucrats and warlords of the time." He pointed to two children who were presenting flowers to Comrade Rashidov and Ambassador Yudin and said, "If our bureaucracy is not corrected, they will storm the walls in the future."

　　Comrade Rashidov said, "I heard that China is now vigorously opposing bureaucracy."

　　Premier Zhou said, "Yes, yesterday I gave a report here to more than two thousand party and non-party cadres on how to correctly handle contradictions among the people and on the new rectification campaign. Our current rectification campaign is against three isms: subjective idealism in thinking, sectarianism in organization, and bureaucracy in work style. From 1942 to 1944, we also conducted a rectification campaign, which mainly opposed subjective idealism in thinking, primarily dogmatism, and sectarianism in organization, especially factionalism within the party and the stereotyped writing style of the party, in order to achieve the unity of the whole party. Now we have seized national power and have entered the period of socialist construction. We must strengthen the unity of the people of the whole country. We must carry out rectification, and rectification should be carried out regularly. Without rectification, our thinking will rust after a few years. Rectification is a good method, it will enable us to move forward continuously. This method must be passed down. People are always like this, they become proud with a little achievement. Communists are no exception, especially in times of victory. They think that even if we have shortcomings, the people will forgive us."

　　Ambassador Yudin said, "Yes, people always think that since they have the support of the people, they will not have bureaucracy."

　　Rashidov interjected, "The tragedy lies here. People often have bureaucracy without even realizing it. What China is doing now is of great significance."

　　At this time, Premier Zhou pointed to the two children and said, "In ten years, if the leaders still have bureaucracy, you must oppose it." Then, the Premier added, "This is a contradiction among the people. After the basic end of class struggle, the contradictions among the people are prominently displayed. In our society, there are still contradictions between the productive forces and the relations of production; contradictions between the economic base and the superstructure. And in various social relations, the contradiction between leaders and the masses will also become prominent."

　　Ambassador Yudin said, "Yes, we also have this kind of contradiction."

　　Premier Zhou continued, "We acknowledge the contradictions, examine the shortcomings, and distinguish the methods of handling them, so that we can constantly resolve these contradictions."

    周总理和苏联贵宾在笕桥机场
    畅谈人民内部矛盾
    本报杭州25日电　记者刘时平报道：周恩来总理今天在杭州笕桥机场上迎接伏罗希洛夫主席。在伏罗希洛夫主席座机抵达之前，周恩来总理曾和先行到达的苏联最高苏维埃主席团副主席拉希多夫、苏联高等教育部长叶留金和苏联驻我国大使尤金交谈了关于人民内部矛盾和反对官僚主义的问题。
    话题是从周恩来总理向贵宾们介绍西湖风景开始的。
    周总理拿着杭州全图含笑对客人说：“今年我已来过杭州两次，所以我可以向你们介绍两句”。
    拉希多夫同志接着说：“领导同志总是很难抽出时间到各处走走的。”
    周总理说：“是的，应该多到各处去走走。老是呆在北京是会产生官僚主义的。北京的城墙高，容易把领导同群众隔开来。”
    拉希多夫开玩笑地说：“城墙高也有个好处，使官僚主义不会播散开来。”
    周总理笑着说：“另有一个好处，要是群众反对官僚主义，城墙还可以挡一阵。不过，这还是不保险的。城墙是可以被冲破的。近四十年前，我们北京学生就曾冲进过北京古城，反对过当时的官僚和军阀。”他指着两个向拉希多夫同志和尤金大使献花的小朋友说，“假如我们的官僚主义不改，他们将来就会冲进城墙的。”
    拉希多夫同志说：“听说中国现在正在大力反对官僚主义。”
    周总理说，“是的，昨天我还在这里向二千多个党内外干部作过关于如何正确处理人民内部矛盾和新的整风报告。我们现在整风是反对三个主义，这就是思想上的主观主义，组织上的宗派主义和作风上的官僚主义。在1942年到1944年间，我们就曾整过风，那时主要是反对思想上的主观主义，首先是教条主义和组织上的宗派主义，特别是党内的宗派主义和党八股作风，以求得全党的团结。现在我们掌握了全国政权，并且已经进入社会主义建设时期。我们要加强全国人民的团结，我们要整风，整风是应该经常进行的。不整风，过了几年思想就会生锈，整风是一个很好的办法，它会使我们不断地前进。这个办法要一直传下去。人总是这样，稍有成绩，就会骄傲。共产党人也不例外，特别是在胜利的时候。以为我们有了缺点，人民也会原谅我们的。”
    尤金大使说，“是啊，人们总是以为，既有人民的拥护，他们就不会有官僚主义。”
    拉希多夫插上说，“悲剧也就在这里。人们往往有了官僚主义，而自己还不能觉察到。现在中国进行这个工作是具有重大意义的。”
    这时，周总理指着两个小朋友说，“你们再过十年，如果领导还有官僚主义，你们就要反对。”接着，总理又说，“这是一个人民内部的矛盾。在阶级斗争基本结束以后，人民内部矛盾就突出地显示出来。在我们社会中，仍然有生产力和生产关系的矛盾；经济基础和上层建筑的矛盾。而在各种社会关系中，领导和群众的矛盾方面也会突出。”
    尤金大使说，“是的，我们也有这种矛盾。”
    周总理接着说，“我们承认矛盾，检查缺点，区别处理方法，就可以不断地解决这些矛盾。”
