Xinhua News Agency, Sanmenxia, April 5th (Xinhua News Agency reporters Jun Qian, Zhou Yuan): The Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Hub Project on the Yellow River, approved by the State Council, will officially commence construction on April 13th. On the day of the groundbreaking, the Sanmenxia Engineering Bureau of the Yellow River will hold a grand opening ceremony. Currently, the workers on the Sanmenxia construction site are stepping up their final preparations before the start of construction, awaiting the commencement order.

Prior to this, the Sanmenxia Engineering Bureau had made extensive preparations. In addition to forming the first phase of the construction team and successively transporting many mechanical equipment and materials necessary for the start of construction, it also built the housing and roads needed for the construction area and made overall arrangements for the project's construction. From the "Project Layout Plan" hanging in the Chief Engineer's Office of the Engineering Bureau, it can be seen that the entire construction site stretches for dozens of miles along the Yellow River, divided into four construction areas: Sanmenxia Area, Daan Area, Huixing Area, and Lingbao Area, with the Lingbao Area being more than a hundred miles away. The various construction areas are connected by highways and railways. Various roads and high-voltage transmission lines between Huixing, Daan, and Sanmenxia form a dense network on the map. The four construction areas are: Lingbao Area is a sand and gravel material factory, Huixing Area is the Engineering Bureau and six affiliated factories, Daan Area is the dam construction branch bureau and workers' area, and the most front-line and most important construction area is the Sanmenxia Area: here, the Engineering Bureau's construction advance command post will be located on a hill on the right bank close to the dam site area, and concrete mixing machinery, automobiles, electrical and other bases are distributed on the right bank. There is a construction section system on the west bank of the river valley, connected by a cable bridge erected on the three islands and a railway bridge under construction. From Lingbao to Huixing, to Daan, to Sanmenxia, a huge construction site, a huge construction system, has formed along the Yellow River.

The mountain cliffs on both sides of the Sanmenxia River valley are steep, the gullies and ridges overlap, and the complex terrain, coupled with the scarcity of villages and residents, has increased the difficulty of construction preparation. Now, tens of thousands of workers have gathered, and all office buildings, factory buildings, and worker dormitories are newly built. The material and cultural life needs of the workers have initially taken shape through long-term efforts and support from various places. The roads in the riverbank mountains are winding. The completed highways and railways under construction go up and down and turn left and right between the gullies and ridges, which is extremely difficult. The water for the first phase of construction is obtained by digging wells 60 meters deep underground; the 1,200 kW diesel generator prepared for the first phase of construction has also been installed. The first phase of construction will excavate quartz monzonite using pneumatic drills, and some air compressors have already started operating. After the start of construction, the rocks of the dam foundation on the left bank will be excavated first. The preparation work for the excavation on the left bank has been stepped up in recent days.

The completion of the preliminary design of the Sanmenxia project entrusted to the Soviet Union is an important key to the start of the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Hub Project as originally planned this spring. This design was completed at the beginning of this year, which provides a basis for technical design and construction. This design stipulates that the dam will be across the river between the three islands and the Zhongliudi Pillar, with the three islands inside the future dam. The designed reservoir water level is 360 meters above sea level, which can store 6.47 billion cubic meters of floodwater. Compared with the original plan, the water level is raised by 10 meters, and the reservoir capacity is increased by 2.87 billion cubic meters. However, this is the final water level and capacity after the project is completed in a few years. During construction, the method of gradually raising the dam year by year will be adopted, so that the reservoir area can be cleaned and relocated in an orderly manner. The main construction this year is the excavation of the dam foundation on the left end of the dam. Therefore, this year will still be a combination of construction and continued preparation, with equal emphasis on construction and preparation, to create conditions for larger-scale construction next year. According to a person in charge of the Engineering Bureau, this year's construction plan is based on the overall goal of striving to start flood control and power generation in 1961 and basically completing the entire project in 1962.

    三门峡水利枢纽工程下周动工
    新华社三门峡5日电　新华社记者君谦、周原报道：黄河三门峡水利枢纽工程已经国务院批准将于4月13日正式施工。开工那天，黄河三门峡工程局将举行隆重的开工仪式。现在，三门峡工地上的职工，正在加紧进行开工前夕的最后准备工作，等候开工命令。
    在此以前，三门峡工程局已经作了浩繁的准备工作：除组成了第一期工程的施工队伍、陆续运到了开工所必需的许多机械装备和器材外，还建筑了工区所需要的房屋和道路，作好了工程施工的总体布置。从工程局总工程师室所挂的一张“工程平面布置图”上，可以看到整个工地沿黄河长数十里，分三门峡区、大安区、会兴区和灵宝区四个工区，而其中灵宝区还在百里以外。各工区之间有公路、铁路相接，会兴、大安、三门峡之间各种道路和高压输电线的线路，在图上构成了一个密集的网。这四个工区是：灵宝区为砂石材料厂，会兴区为工程局和六个附属工厂，大安区为坝工分局和工人区，最前线的是三门峡区也是最重要的一个工区：这里，工程局的施工前哨指挥所将设在右岸接近坝址区的一个山头上，混凝土拌和系机机械、汽车、电气等基地都分布在右岸。河谷西岸各有一个工段系统，有架设在三岛上的铁索吊桥和正在兴修的铁桥相接。从灵宝到会兴、到大安、到三门峡，沿黄河形成了庞大的工地，一个庞大的施工系统。
    三门峡河谷两岸山崖陡峭、沟岭重叠，地形复杂，加以村舍、居民很少，增加了施工准备的困难。现在，数万职工云集，一切办公楼、厂房、职工宿舍都是新修的，职工物质生活和文化生活所需，经长期努力和各地支援已初具规模。河岸山间道路曲折，已修成的公路和正修建的铁路，都是在沟岭之间一上一下，左转右转，极为艰巨。第一期施工工地用水是在掘井在六十公尺深的地下取得的；第一期施工用电准备使用的一千二百瓩的柴油发电机也已经安装就绪了。第一期施工开挖闪长斑岩，使用风钻，一部分空气压缩机已经开始运转了。开工后将首先开挖左岸坝基的岩石，左岸开挖的准备工作近日还在加紧进行。
    三门峡水利枢纽工程能按原计划在今年春天开工，我国委托苏联编制的三门峡工程初步设计的完成是重要的关键。这个设计今年年初就完成了，这就为技术设计和施工提供了依据。这个设计规定大坝横在河中三岛和中流砥柱之间，三岛在将来的坝内。设计的水库水位拔海高程为三百六十公尺，可以拦蓄洪水六百四十七亿公方。和原规划比较，水位提高了十公尺，水库容积增加了二百八十七亿公方。但这是几年以后工程修成了的最后的水位和容量。施工中将采取大坝逐年加高的办法，使库区内得以从容清理和迁移。而今年施工主要是开挖大坝左端的坝基。因而今年还是一面施工一面继续准备，施工与准备工作并重，为明年更大规模地施工创造条件。据工程局一位负责人说，今年的施工计划，是根据争取1961年开始拦洪发电和1962年基本上建成全部工程的总目标制定的。
