    Adding Political Common Sense Classes in Elementary Schools

    In order to strengthen ideological and political education for students, Taizhou City, Jiangsu Province, recently added a political common sense course to the sixth grade of elementary schools. Principals and directors of teaching affairs from each school serve as political common sense teachers, solving the problem of teacher shortage.

    To overcome the difficulty of lacking teaching materials, they also came up with many methods according to the time and local conditions. For example, the topic of their first lesson was: "Build our motherland more beautifully." Before the start of the class, principals, directors of teaching affairs, and some class teachers of twenty complete primary schools in the city conducted collective lesson preparation in each school district, enriching the specific teaching materials. They collected achievements in the construction of the motherland, heroic figures on the industrial and agricultural fronts, and the deeds of former senior primary school graduates in the city participating in labor production and self-study from newspapers and magazines to enrich the content of the "Political Common Sense Reference Materials." In order to enrich teaching, the schools also led students to carry out extracurricular activities. Some organized students to form handicraft groups to make industrial machine models; some established gardening groups to plant vegetables; and some used the activities of the Young Pioneers to tell stories of heroic figures to cultivate their love for the motherland and labor.

    At present, due to the lack of political common sense teachers and complete teaching materials in many senior primary schools, there are many difficulties in adding political common sense courses. However, as long as the school leaders realize the importance of strengthening the regular ideological and political education of students and actively find ways, these difficulties can be overcome. The practice of the primary schools in Taizhou City provides a good example.

    小学增加政治常识课
    为加强对学生的思想政治教育，最近，江苏省泰州市各小学六年级新添了政治常识课程。由各校校长、教导主任担任政治常识教员，解决了师资问题。
    为克服教材缺乏的困难，他们也因时因地地想出了许多办法，如他们第一课讲的题目是：把我们的祖国建设得更美丽。在开课前，全市二十个完全小学的校长、教导主任及部分班主任，分别在各学委区进行了集体备课，充实具体教材。他们在报章杂志上搜集了祖国建设成就、工农业战线上的英雄人物和本市往届高小毕业生参加劳动生产及自学的事迹，充实了“政治常识参考教材”的内容。为了丰富教学，各校还领导学生进行课外活动，有的组织学生成立工艺小组，制造工业机器模型；有的建立园艺小组，种植菜蔬；有的通过少先队的活动讲述英雄人物的故事，培养他们爱祖国、爱劳动的思想。
    在当前，由于很多高级小学尚缺乏政治常识教师和完整的教材，新增加政治常识课程是有很多困难的。但是，只要学校领导方面，认识到加强对学生经常贯彻思想政治教育的重要意义，积极想办法，这些困难是可以克服的。泰州市各小学的做法提供了一个榜样。
