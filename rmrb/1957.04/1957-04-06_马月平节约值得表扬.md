Ma Yueping's Frugality Deserves Praise
Editor

A worker's family of five, with a monthly income of 54 yuan, averaging 10.8 yuan per person, is able to save a little money because the housewife, Ma Yueping, is able to budget carefully and plan expenses reasonably. Is such a thing worth praising? We have received many letters and have already selected and published a few. Some think it is worthwhile, others do not. Since both sides have largely made their points, we intend to discontinue the discussion. We will now offer some simple opinions on the issues involved in the debate.

Does the newspaper's use of this example in its editorial promote lowering living standards and tightening belts to save? No. First, demand deposit savings are available for withdrawal at any time and do not reduce daily household consumption. Second, saving one yuan per month through fixed deposit with lump-sum withdrawal only accounts for one fifty-fourth of the income, which has minimal impact on daily life, and the "lump-sum withdrawal" in the future is still for household consumption.

Is Ma Yueping's family life too hard? - This is relative. There is enough grain and coal, oil, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar are available, the children can go to school, the rent can be paid monthly, and there is still more than ten cents a day to buy vegetables... By China's general standards, this life cannot be said to be too hard. Compared to the lives of workers before liberation, there has been improvement.

How many times a month can Ma Yueping's family eat meat? Unknown. However, some other worker families usually eat pickles and save money to eat meat on Sundays. If they don't eat meat and eat more vegetables, that's also perfectly acceptable. It is said that the Ma Yueping family's dishes are still very palatable.

During the period of socialist construction, the country needs a large amount of capital, and consumer goods in society are not very abundant. Under these circumstances, if ordinary working families can budget carefully, plan expenses, save money for future use, avoid seeking relief in times of need, and accumulate capital for the country, it will greatly benefit both the country and themselves. Therefore, we believe it is appropriate to publicly praise Ma Yueping in the newspaper and call on workers to widely participate in savings.

### 马月平节约值得表扬

    马月平节约值得表扬
    编者
    五口人，每月收入五十四元、每人平均十元八角钱的一个工人家庭，因为主妇马月平能精打细算，合理计划开支，结果也能储蓄一点。这样一件事值不值得表扬呢？我们收到的来信很多，已经择登了几封。其中有认为值得的，有认为不值得的。因为两方面的意见大体已经讲了，我们准备不再讨论下去了。现在仅就争论中涉及的问题提出我们一些简单的意见。
    本报在社论中举这个例子，是不是提倡人们降低生活水平，勒紧裤带来储蓄呢？不是的。第一、活期储蓄是随用随取，并不因此减少家庭日常消费。第二、每月存一元钱的零存整取，只占收入五十四分之一，对日常生活影响极小，而且将来“整取”回来还是供家庭消费。
    马月平家的生活是不是太苦了呢？——这是相对的。粮食、煤炭够用，油盐酱醋也有，孩子能够上学，房租能够按月付上，每天还有一角多钱可以买菜蔬……以我国一般水平说，这生活不能说是太苦的。与解放以前的工人生活相比，也是有了改善的。
    马月平家一月能不能吃几次肉呢？不知道。不过，另外有些工人家庭，平常吃些咸菜，省下钱星期日吃肉的也有。如果不吃肉而多吃蔬菜，那也无所不可。据说马月平家的菜还是很可口的。
    在社会主义建设时期，国家需要大量资金，社会上消费物资又不很充裕。在这种情况下，如果一般劳动者家庭能够精打细算，计划开支，积钱备用，省得有事时请求救济，又能给国家积累资金，这对国家和自己都有很大好处。所以我们认为在报纸上公开表扬马月平，号召劳动者普遍参加储蓄，还是恰当的。
