    Ashamed to Receive the Award

    Almost every worker at the Fengtai Bridge Factory received a bonus for exceeding the state plan in the first quarter of this year; even An Zhiya, the blueprint operator who took time off to get a haircut, received a bonus of 12% of her salary. The scope of the awards was more widespread than in previous years, and the bonus amounts were also higher: the factory spent a total of more than 16,000 yuan. Is this a good thing or a bad thing? At first glance, it seems like a good thing. Because the factory did exceed the state plan in the first quarter: the total output value reached 146.7% of the plan; the commodity output value reached 154.6% of the plan, and the labor productivity reached 123.6% of the plan. However, don't just look at these percentages; it is more important to see the problems that exist within these percentages.

    The factory has seven main workshops producing finished products. The tasks for two cement workshops were fully met, but the tasks for five steel beam workshops were insufficient. Because of the insufficient tasks, some workers were drawn out for study, some were drawn out to work in other workshops, and some had no work to do and simply wandered around the workshops. Insufficient tasks and low plans naturally made it easy to exceed the target. The total output value in the first quarter of this year was more than 1.77 million yuan less than in the second quarter of last year, and labor productivity was more than 550,000 yuan less, but the award standards were even higher than in the second quarter of last year.

    The factory leaders were not unaware of the above situation. However, why did they do this? The "reasons" are no more than three: first, the insufficient production tasks are a matter for the state; according to regulations, bonuses should be given for exceeding the task; second, awarding bonuses can complete the wage plan; third, giving workers a few more yuan to spend can improve their lives.

    I believe that such rewards cannot encourage the advanced and drive the backward, but are wasting state funds. If it is said that awards can be given as long as the index is completed at a high level, regardless of other conditions, then setting plans will take "conservative, conservative, and conservative again" as the best criterion. However, this can only cause losses to the state.

    The workers are not "happy" to receive such bonuses, but feel ashamed to receive them, and many are unwilling to take them. Some workers joked: "Playing chess and poker have also earned merits." An accountant crossed out his name when calculating the bonus amounts for everyone. I am also one of the award recipients, but we are unwilling to take such bonuses!

    得奖有愧
    丰台桥梁工厂的职工，差不多人人手里都拿到了今年第一季度超额完成国家计划的奖金；连工作时间去理发的晒图员安致雅也得了本人工资12％的奖金。评奖面比往年普遍，奖金数比往年也高：全厂一共花去了一万六千多元。这究竟是件好事呢，还是坏事？乍看起来，是件好事。因为这个厂在第一季度里，的确超额完成了国家计划：总产值完成计划的146.7％；商品产值完成计划的154.6％，劳动生产率完成计划的123.6％。但是，不要只看到这些百分比，更重要的是要看到这些百分比中存在的问题。
    这个厂有七个出成品的主要车间，两个水泥车间任务满量，五个钢梁车间任务都不足。因为任务不足，有的工人抽出来学习，有的抽出来到其他车间工作，也有的没活干，干脆在车间里蹓跶。任务不足，计划偏低，当然容易超额。今年第一季度总产值比去年第二季度少完成了一百七十七万多元，劳动生产率少完成了五十五万多元，而评奖标准却比去年第二季度还高。
    以上情况，这个厂的领导人员不是不知道。可是，他们为什么又要这么作呢？“理由”不外三个：一、生产任务不足，是国家的事；超额完成任务，按规定，就应当给奖；二、评奖可以完成工资计划；三、多给工人几块钱花花，改善改善生活。
    我认为，像这样的奖励，根本不能鼓励先进、带动落后，而是在浪费国家资金。假如说，不管其他条件，只要指数完成得高就可以获奖，那么，订计划将以“保守、保守、再保守”作为最好的准则。但是，这只能是国家遭受损失。
    对于拿这样的奖金，职工群众并不是“高兴”，而是感到得奖有愧，很多人都不愿意拿。有的工人幽默地说：“下棋、打扑克还打出功劳来了。”一个司账员在给大家计算得奖金额的时候，用笔勾去了自己的名字。我也是得奖人之一，但是，我们不愿拿这样的奖金！
