    Whales Also Suffer from Toothache
    "Can whales also have toothache?" British scientist Bruce gave an affirmative answer to this question. On the 23rd, he sent a sperm whale tooth, which he recently brought back from Antarctica to England, to the Sheffield Museum. A tumor, the size of a tennis ball, grew on the tooth. This shows that whales sometimes suffer from toothache.

    鲸鱼也患牙痛
    “鲸鱼也会有牙痛吗？”英国科学家布鲁斯对这个问题作了肯定的答复。他在23日把他最近从南极带到英国的一枚大头鲸的牙齿送给了设菲尔德的博物馆。在这枚牙齿上长了一个肿瘤，大小和一个网球一样。这说明鲸鱼有时也患牙痛。
