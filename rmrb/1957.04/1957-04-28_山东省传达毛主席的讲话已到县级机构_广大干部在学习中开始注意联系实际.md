Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 27th. Chairman Mao's speech on the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People delivered at the Supreme State Conference has been disseminated to staff members of county-level institutions in Shandong Province. According to incomplete statistics, basic-level cadres in Qingdao, Yantai, and Zibo cities, as well as most counties in the Huimin, Heze, Liaocheng, Jining, and Laiyang regions, have also heard the reports. Up to now, more than 200,000 party and non-party cadres and senior intellectuals in the scientific and literary fields throughout the province have heard the reports.

At present, the broad masses of cadres in various localities have begun to pay preliminary attention to linking theory with practice in their studies and discussions, analyzing the contradictions among the people in various localities and units, and studying methods for handling contradictions. The Qingdao Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a special meeting on April 18 to discuss the issue of students entering higher education and participating in labor. The Liaocheng Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is holding a meeting of county party secretaries to study how to correctly handle contradictions in rural areas. In their studies, many cadres have come to realize that to resolve contradictions among the people, the important issue lies in promoting democracy, overcoming bureaucratic, subjectivist, and sectarian work styles, and strengthening the Party's political and ideological work.

    山东省传达毛主席的讲话已到县级机构
    广大干部在学习中开始注意联系实际
    据新华社济南27日电　毛主席在最高国务会议上关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的讲话在山东省已经传达到县一级机构的工作人员。据不完全统计，青岛、烟台、淄博三个市以及惠民、菏泽、聊城、济宁、莱阳等专区大部分县的基层干部也听到了传达报告。到目前为止，全省听到传达报告的党内外干部以及科学界、文艺界的高级知识分子等已经有二十多万人。
    目前，各地广大干部在学习和讨论中都初步注意到联系实际，分析各地和各单位人民内部的矛盾，研究处理矛盾的方法。中共青岛市委在4月18日专门召开了一次会议，讨论学生升学和参加劳动的问题；中共聊城地委正在召开县委书记会议，研究如何正确处理农村中的矛盾。在学习中，许多干部体会到要解决人民内部的矛盾，重要的问题在于发扬民主，克服官僚主义、主观主义和宗派主义的作风，加强党的政治思想工作。
