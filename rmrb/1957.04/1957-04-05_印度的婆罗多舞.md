Indian Bharatanatyam Dance
Dai Ailian

After watching the performances of the outstanding Indian Bharatanatyam classical dancers, Kamala Lakshman and her sister, I felt a high degree of artistic satisfaction.

Bharatanatyam is one of the four famous schools of dance in India. It has a complete dance form, requiring high and skillful technique, and is capable of expressing rich emotions. The sculptural quality of this dance is very distinct, and from one pose to another, it expresses various beautiful postures. It allows people to see the high degree of beauty of the human body, from the hair, eyebrows, face, all the way to the feet. I am very fond of this dance form, and I have seen performances by many Bharatanatyam dancers, each with their own characteristics. The content and form of Bharatanatyam dance are diverse. In the performances of Kamala Lakshman and her sister, we can fully see this. The dance movements of "Kalathuki Dance" are very fast; the rhythm of the "Snake Dance" is slow; while "Veena Dance" is pantomimic. As for the "Allarippu Dance" performed by Kamala Lakshman and her sister, I have seen several different styles of performances; Kamala Lakshman and her sister's dance movements are particularly rich.

Kamala Lakshman is a Bharatanatyam dancer of no more than twenty-two years old, with high accomplishments and reputation. She started learning dance at the age of five, and after seventeen years of hard work, she has become a world-renowned dancer. Her dance postures are not only beautiful, like exquisite sculptures, but her expressions are also delicate and full of drama; her musical sense is also very strong. She is a first-class dancer with comprehensive training. She dances so beautifully, so vividly, that you unconsciously feel closer to the gods she describes. Like other outstanding artists, her emotions during the dance always run through from beginning to end, without a moment's interruption. It is as if you are listening to her telling a moving story without end, unwilling to relax for a moment. In Bharatanatyam dance, there is a basic movement where the hands are on the waist and the feet step back, allowing the dancer to rest for a moment. However, even in this resting movement, Kamala Lakshman's emotions are still consistent, and not interrupted by it. She is a Bharatanatyam dancer, but when she dances other Indian dances, such as the "Kathak Dance" performed this time, she is equally attractive.

The "Snake Dance" performed by Kamala Lakshman is particularly popular with our Chinese audience. This is a dance depicting the divine snake on the head of Lord Shiva. Sometimes, we seem to see the head of the divine snake swaying; sometimes, we seem to see it crawling.... In this dance movement, there is a difficult pose to do: kneeling on the ground with both legs, tilting the head back, raising the calves and touching the head with the toes; the arms move constantly. Kamala Lakshman displayed superb skills in this dance, and people couldn't help but applaud and say, "How beautiful!" Indians love Lord Krishna very much. In Indian folklore, Lord Krishna was originally a mischievous shepherd boy who played the flute very well; the girls all loved him. The "Veena Dance" performed by Kamala Lakshman depicts a girl falling in love with Lord Krishna, asking him to love her too, and not to joke with her. This is a delicate and very interesting dance. Kamala Lakshman delicately portrays the girl's innocence and loveliness, filled with love, convincingly making people feel that Lord Krishna is joking beside the girl.

Coming with Kamala Lakshman this time is her twelve-year-old sister, Radha Lakshman. In India, the beloved Lord Krishna is most fond of the intelligent and lovely Goddess Radha. Radha Lakshman is as lovely as Goddess Radha, she dances so seriously and skillfully; as she grows older, her dance skills will become more mature.

Indian music and art, like dance art, have achieved a high degree of development. Although there are not many people accompanying Kamala Lakshman and her sister this time, their accompaniment is very attractive and has achieved good results.

The performance of Kamala Lakshman and her sister deeply moved me. I believe that the Chinese audience will be as captivated by their artistic charm as the Indian people are. (Attached pictures)

    印度的婆罗多舞
    戴爱莲
    看了印度杰出的婆罗多古典舞蹈家卡玛拉·拉克希曼姊妹的演出，我感到艺术上的高度满足。
    婆罗多舞是印度著名的四大舞蹈学派之一。它有着完整的舞蹈形式，它需要很高、很巧妙的技术；它能够表现丰富的感情。这种舞蹈的雕塑性很鲜明，从一个舞姿到另一个舞姿，表现了各种美的姿态。它使人们看到了，从头发、眉目、面部、一直到脚的、人体的高度的美。我很欢喜这种舞蹈形式，我也看过不少婆罗多舞舞蹈家的演出，他们各有特色。婆罗多舞的内容和形式是多样的。在卡玛拉·拉克希曼姊妹的演出中，我们便能充分地看出来。“卡拉徒基舞”的舞蹈动作很快；“蛇舞”的节奏缓慢；“威那姆舞”却又是哑剧性的。而卡玛拉·拉克希曼姊妹二人表演的“阿拉雷普舞”，我也曾看过几种不同样式的演出；卡玛拉·拉克希曼姊妹的舞蹈动作特别丰富。
    卡玛拉·拉克希曼是一位不过二十二岁而有很高素养和声誉的婆罗多舞舞蹈家。她从五岁起开始学舞，经过十七年的辛勤劳动，已经成为世界闻名的舞蹈家。她的舞姿不但很美，像是一座座绝妙的雕塑；她的表情细致，富有戏剧性；她的音乐感也很强。她是一个有全面修养的第一流舞蹈家。她舞得这么美，这么生动，使你不知不觉地也像和她所描述的神接近了。正如其他杰出的艺术家一样，她在舞蹈时的情绪，总是从头贯穿到底，没有瞬间的间歇。你像在听她缕缕不绝地叙述一个动人的故事，一刻也不愿放松。在婆罗多舞蹈中，有一个基本动作是双手叉腰，两脚后退；让演员休息一下。可是，卡玛拉·拉克希曼即使在这个休息动作中，她的情绪仍是贯穿的，并不因之间断。她是一个婆罗多舞舞蹈家，但她跳起别的印度舞时，如这次演出的“卡塔克舞”，同样也是吸引人的。
    卡玛拉·拉克希曼表演的“蛇舞”，特别受到我国观众的欢迎。这是一个描写湿婆神顶上的神蛇的舞蹈。有时，我们像看到神蛇的头在摆动；有时，又像看到它在爬行……。在这个舞蹈动作中，有一个很难做的姿态：双腿跪在地上，头往后仰，小腿抬起来脚尖碰到头；双臂一刻也不停地舞动。卡玛拉·拉克希曼在这个舞蹈中显示了高超的技艺，人们不禁鼓着掌说：“多美呵！”印度人很喜爱克利什那神。在印度的民间传说中，克利什那神原是一个调皮的、笛子吹得非常好听的牧童；姑娘们都很爱他。卡玛拉·拉克希曼表演的“威那姆舞”就是描写一个少女爱上克利什那神，要求他也爱她，不要和她开玩笑。这是一个表情细腻、非常有趣的舞蹈。卡玛拉·拉克希曼细致地刻划了这个少女的天真可爱、充满着爱情的心情，使人信服地感到克利什那神就像在少女身边开着玩笑。
    和卡玛拉·拉克希曼这次同来演出的，是她的十二岁的妹妹拉达·拉克希曼。在印度，人们喜爱的克利什那神最欢喜聪明可爱的拉达女神。拉达·拉克希曼像拉达女神一样可爱，她跳得这么认真、纯熟；随着年龄的增长，她的舞蹈技艺将会更成熟。
    印度的音乐艺术和舞蹈艺术一样有着高度的发展。这次为卡玛拉·拉克希曼姊妹伴奏的人虽不多，他们的伴奏却很吸引人，并取得了良好的效果。
    卡玛拉·拉克希曼姊妹的表演，深深地感动了我。我相信，中国观众一定会像印度人民一样，为她们的艺术魅力所倾倒。（附图片）
