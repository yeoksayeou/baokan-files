    Refining Sugar with Bentonite
    Indian scientists have recently demonstrated through experiments that clarifying cane juice using carbonation methods can effectively remove impurities in the cane juice and produce high-grade sugar.
    This method involves adding an appropriate amount (usually half a pound per ton of cane) of chemically processed bentonite suspension to the sulphited cane juice when the cane juice is poured from the sulfurous acid.
    The benefits of adding bentonite to the cane juice are that it is easy to clarify the cane juice and there is less color change. Bentonite can help clarify and maintain the quality of the sugar. This method can also reduce troubles with cane juice heaters, evaporators, and scale removal. Sugar made in this way can be stored and the color can remain unchanged. (Science)

    使用皂土炼糖
    印度科学家最近试验证明，用碳化法澄清蔗汁能有效地除去蔗汁内的杂质，生产高级糖。
    这种方法是当蔗汁从亚硫酸中倾出时，加以适量（通常是每吨蔗内加半磅）的化学加工皂土悬浮体在亚硫酸化的蔗汁内。
    在蔗汁内加进皂土的好处是，易于澄清蔗汁，颜色改变较少。皂土能帮助澄清和保持糖的质量。用这种方法还能减少蔗汁加热器、蒸发器和去除锅垢的麻烦。这样制成的糖贮藏起来，颜色仍可以保持不变。　（科）
