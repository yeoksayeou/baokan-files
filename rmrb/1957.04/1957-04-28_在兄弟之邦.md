In Fraternal Countries

    At the industrial and agricultural exhibition recently held in Pyongyang, there was a place that attracted particular attention: here were displayed various brightly colored textiles. They looked like ordinary woolen fabrics, but in reality, they were made from ordinary stone—limestone.

    This is the result of the hard work of the staff of the Central Scientific Research Institute of the Korean Ministry of Chemical Industry. They made artificial fibers from calcium carbide. The fabric woven from this fiber is almost the same as wool. Stone fabric is light, warm, and strong, and much cheaper than wool.

    Currently, North Korea is only using calcium carbide to make artificial fibers in the laboratory. But soon, a large factory will be built in Hungnam City, which will be the world's first factory to make "woolen fabrics" from stone.

    During the second Five-Year Plan (1956-1960), bridge experts from Czechoslovakia will build the world's largest arch bridge on the largest reservoir on the Vltava River. The span of the bridge arch will reach 330 meters. So far, the world's largest arch bridge is the steel arch bridge built on Niagara Falls, which has a span of only 289 meters.

    The upper structure of the steel arch bridge that Czechoslovakia plans to build will be 540 meters long. The bridge will be erected 105 meters above the valley floor and 50 meters above the highest water level of the reservoir.

    Recently, the Galati Shipyard in Romania began manufacturing the first domestically produced ocean-going vessel, with a deadweight of 2,000 tons. Ocean-going cargo ships with medium deadweight will also begin to be built here. At present, the number of ships manufactured by the Galati Shipyard has increased twelve times compared to 1945. At the same time, the Braila Shipyard is now manufacturing hoisting cylinders for salvaging ships, which is also a first in Romania. (Attached picture)

    Not long ago, the Soviet Vladivostok Air Rescue Team received an urgent telegram: a geologist had an accident in the great forest. The rescue team immediately sent Dr. Sergeyeva by helicopter for emergency treatment.

    Vimpuk, in southern Bohemia, Czechoslovakia, is famous for publishing all kinds of beautifully printed Islamic Korans. Among them is a pocket-sized version, about half the size of a thumb.

    在兄弟之邦
    最近在平壤举办的工业和农业展览会上，有一个地方特别引人注目：这里陈列着各式各样色彩鲜艳的纺织品。看上去，这些东西和普通的毛织品一样，实际上却是用普通的石头——石灰石做成的。
    这是朝鲜化学工业部中央科学研究所的工作人员辛勤劳动的结果。他们用碳化钙制成了人造纤维。用这种纤维织出的料子同毛料子简直差不多。石制料子既轻暖又结实，而且要比毛料子便宜很多。
    目前朝鲜只是在实验室里用碳化钙作人造纤维。但是不久，在兴南市就要盖起一座大工厂，这里将是世界上第一次用石头做的“毛织品”的工厂。
    在第二个五年计划期间（1956—1960年），捷克斯洛伐克的桥梁专家将在弗尔塔瓦河的最巨大的水库上，建造一座世界上最大的拱桥，桥拱的跨度将达三百三十公尺。到目前为止，世界上最大的拱桥是建筑在尼阿迦拉河瀑布上的钢拱桥，它的跨度不过是二百八十九公尺。
    捷克斯洛伐克准备建筑的这座钢拱桥的上部结构，总长将为五百四十公尺。桥将架设在离河谷地面一百零五公尺、离水库的最高水面五十公尺的高度上。
    最近，罗马尼亚加拉兹造船所开始制造第一艘本国自制的海洋轮船，载重两千吨。具有中等载重量的海洋运货轮船也将开始在这里建造。目前，加拉兹造船所制造船只的数目已经增加为1945年的十二倍。同时，布赖拉造船所现在正在制造打捞船只的吊举圆筒，这在罗马尼亚也还是第一次。（附图片）
    不久前的一天，苏联海参崴的航空救护队收到了一封急电：一个地质工作者在大森林里发生了事故。救护队立即派医生谢尔盖耶娃乘直升飞机前去急救。

    捷克斯洛伐克波希米亚南部的维姆普克地方，以出版各种各样印刷精美的伊斯兰教可兰经而著名。其中有一种袖珍本的，大小只等于半个大拇指。
