    Investigation Report on the Living Conditions of Farmers in Longchong Township
    Du Daozheng, Zheng Shiwen, Liu Han, Fang Jingbo
    Compared to the villages next to the county, Longchong Township in Gaoyao County, Guangdong Province, is considered average or above in terms of work, and in the lower-middle range in terms of production conditions and living standards. The Gaoyao County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and many district and township cadres believe that it can represent the majority of villages.
    We investigated Longchong Township for three weeks. The materials used in this article are all from the investigation. The materials from the 12 typical households were carefully calculated by the heads of the households, thoroughly discussed, and also observed by us on the ground. The materials from other households were calculated by the village and township cadres household by household. All the materials have been repeatedly checked by several key township cadres.
    I. Are the Farmers' Lives Really Manageable?
    Or not?
    This is the primary item of our investigation. The results of the investigation can be summarized into two basic figures: 86.7 to 13.3. Out of 100 people, 86.7 are doing okay, and 13.3 are not. To be more specific, those who are doing okay are: 44 wealthy households with 195 people, and 464 middle-income households with 1840 people, totaling 508 households with 2035 people, accounting for 86.7% of the total population of the village. Those who are not doing okay are: 77 households in difficulty with 282 people, and 28 households of "Five Guarantees" households with 31 people, totaling 105 households in difficulty with 313 people, accounting for 13.3% of the total population of the village.
    The wealthy, middle-income, and struggling households mentioned here are purely classified based on the level of living standards. Wealthy households had an average net income of 87 yuan per person last year, middle-income households had an average net income of 67 yuan per person, struggling households had an average net income of 50 yuan per person, and "Five Guarantees" households had an income of over 400 jin of grain per person.
    However, according to the precise investigation of 12 representative typical households, the income figures mentioned above for wealthy and middle-income households are slightly underestimated, and the income figure for struggling households is slightly overestimated. The results of the typical investigation are: wealthy households had an average net income of 117.4 yuan per person last year, middle-income households had an average net income of 76.1 yuan per person last year, and struggling households had an average net income of only 41.2 yuan per person last year.
    Wealthy households live a life equivalent to that of the old wealthy middle peasants. Last year, the 3 wealthy typical households with 13 people had an average net income of 117.4 yuan per person. In rural areas, a net income of nearly ten yuan per month per person is considered a wealthy life. Even based on the lower village-wide statistical figure of 87 yuan per person, a net income of seven or eight yuan per month per person is considered a comfortable life. They have sufficient rations, are particular about their food, have new clothes, good utensils, and have money to spare. One wealthy household named Li Wan, with 3 people, consumed 31 jin of pork last year alone. Other wealthy households consume six or seven liang of cooking oil and six or seven liang of pork per person per month. Some wealthy households are already preparing to build new houses, and some have already built new houses.
    The 464 middle-income households live a life equivalent to that of the old lower-middle peasants. According to local farmers, the life of the so-called old lower-middle peasants is: one person (averaging out busy and slack seasons, and adults and children) can eat 47 jin of rice, 15 jin of sweet potatoes and taro, five liang of oil, five liang of meat, half a jin of salt, and 15 jin of vegetables per month. They also spend 20 cents on miscellaneous items such as sugar, powder, and matches (firewood is all self-supplied, and income and expenditure are not included). In addition, old lower-middle peasants need to add three new clothes and a pair of wooden clogs per year, and a straw hat and a raincoat every two years. They also have to spend about 5 yuan a year on medicine, kerosene, repairs to farm tools, smoking, and miscellaneous expenses.
    Calculating these items one by one according to local market prices, the cost of food is 4.74 yuan per month, totaling 56.88 yuan per year. Clothing and utensils cost 12 yuan. Food, clothing, and utensils cost a total of 68.88 yuan.
    Last year, the average net income of middle-income households in the township was 67 yuan, which is roughly consistent with the annual expenditure standard for old lower-middle peasants. In fact, the vast majority of middle-income households have reached or slightly exceeded this level of food, clothing, and utensils. According to the investigation, they had sufficient rations last year, and each person added an average of one and a half single clothes and one underwear (linen vest or shorts), only the expenses for medicine and miscellaneous items were higher than that standard figure. The consumption figures for oil and meat were lower than that standard figure.
    It is worth noting that middle-income households can barely balance their income and expenditure and have no savings. Therefore, they cannot withstand major additional expenses such as medicine or weddings and funerals. Among the seven typical middle-income households, two households had an average net income of over 75 yuan per person last year, but each had a fully capable worker who was sick and spent over 70 yuan on medical expenses. After the family's net income was spent on this huge sum, the net income actually available for each person's expenses decreased from 75 yuan to about 56 yuan. The lives of the two households were much more difficult than those of other middle-income households. They basically did not add new clothes throughout the year and still owed dozens of yuan in debt.
    Among the 464 middle-income households in the township, it is estimated that there are about one hundred households similar to these two households, whose lives are tighter due to additional expenses and deficits.
    The characteristic of the lives of struggling households is insufficient rations. The 77 struggling households generally lack about 3 months of rations and basically have not added a new piece of clothing throughout the year. The Jiang San family, a struggling household, lacks 3 months of rations throughout the year. In his family of 7, he only bought an apron for his wife in a year.
    "Five Guarantees" households are given 30 jin to 35 jin of grain and 5 jiao of money per person per month by the township agricultural production cooperative. Most "Five Guarantees" households can still earn a little work points in the cooperative, living a life of one meal of thin porridge and one meal of dry rice a day.
    II. Are Farmers' Lives Better Now?
    Or were they better in the past?
    Longchong Township was liberated at the end of 1949, completed land reform in early 1953, and collectivized the entire township in early 1956. These are three major changes and three major stages. When comparing lives, compare these three stages specifically.
    When comparing, it is necessary to consider the important impact of natural disasters and population growth, especially natural disasters, on the rise and fall of net income. Longchong Township experienced the worst drought in the memory of older people in the early and late crops of 1956. There was a severe drought in the early crop of 1955. 1953 was a year of favorable weather and bumper harvest. In the late crop of 1949, many villages suffered from floods due to the collapse of dikes, but this village happened to have a bumper harvest in both early and late crops. From 1946 to now, except for the situations mentioned above, other years have been ordinary. There is no data available for population figures in the past, but it was 2200 people in 1952 and 2348 people at the end of 1956, an increase of 7%.
    First, compare 1956, after collectivization but with severe droughts in the early and late crops, with 1955, before collectivization but with only a drought in the early crop. In 1956, the average net income per person of the 12 typical households of various types reached 86.4 yuan; in 1955, the average net income per person of the same number of similar typical households was 67.7 yuan, 18.7 yuan less than in 1956. Among them, the average net income per person of 3 wealthy households in 1956 was 117.4 yuan, the average net income per person of 7 middle-income households was 76.1 yuan, and the average net income per person of 2 struggling households was 41.2 yuan; in 1955, for the same households, the net income per person of wealthy households was 103.8 yuan, 13.6 yuan less than in 1956, the net income per person of middle-income households was 62.2 yuan, 13.9 yuan less than in 1956, and the net income per person of struggling households was 33.3 yuan, 7.9 yuan less than in 1956.
    Looking at the overall situation of the township, there were 44 wealthy households living a life equivalent to that of upper-middle peasants in 1956, while there were only 34 upper-middle peasants (including new and old) in 1955. There were 464 middle-income households living a life equivalent to that of lower-middle peasants in 1956, while there were 296 new and old lower-middle peasants in 1955. Although the struggling households in 1956 still lived a life equivalent to that of poor peasants, the net income of most of them also increased slightly compared to 1955.
    In Longchong Township, nine out of ten people we contacted said in unison: "Last year was such a big drought, but everyone still increased their income, it's really unexpected!"
    Of course, these are all referring to the overall situation, total income, and total average figures. In fact, among those 12 typical households, there were two households (one is now a wealthy household, a new upper-middle peasant before collectivization; one is now a middle-income household, a new lower-middle peasant before collectivization) whose net income in 1956 decreased by 11% compared to 1955 due to the illness of the labor force or the increase in population. The number of households in the entire village whose net income decreased in 1956 compared to 1955 and the extent of the decrease are roughly consistent with the situation of the typical households, with about 10%-15% of the total number of households decreasing, and the extent of the decrease in net income being about 10%.
    Comparing 1956 with 1953: 1953 was the first year after Longchong Township completed land reform, a year of favorable weather and bumper harvest, and a year when farmers had high enthusiasm for production. In addition, that year they received the fruits of the struggle, and farmers called this year the "golden year". Township cadres and farmers estimated based on their impressions that the net income in 1953 was higher than in 1955, and that 1956 restored the vitality of 1953, but the net income would not exceed 1953.
    However, the precise investigation of 12 typical households showed that although the net income in 1953 exceeded 1955, it was lower than in 1956. The average net income per person in 1953 was 79 yuan, 11.3 yuan higher than the average net income per person of 67.7 yuan in 1955, but 7.4 yuan lower than the average net income per person of 86.4 yuan in 1956.
    The main reason why the net income in 1953 was higher than in 1955 was that the former had favorable weather and a bumper harvest, while the latter had a severe drought in the early crop, and 1,000 mu of the 3,602 mu of early rice were lost. In addition, during the unified purchase and sale of grain that began in the winter of 1953, sufficient rations and feed were not retained, and the income from sideline occupations such as pigs and chickens decreased significantly. Although there were severe droughts in the early and late crops of 1956, after collectivization, financial and human resources were arranged reasonably, and water conservancy was done particularly well. A 3.5-li-long canal was built, and 6 ponds were built, reducing the historically drought-stricken land of 2,800 mu to 1,200 mu, overcoming the severe drought. The year, which was supposed to be a year of severe crop failure, turned out to be a bumper harvest, with a total output of 1.98 million jin of rice, which was not only 780,000 jin higher than the 1.2 million jin in 1955, but also 250,000 jin higher than the 1.73 million jin in 1953, a year of favorable weather. In addition, there were sufficient rations in 1956, feed grain was improved, and household sideline occupations developed more than in 1955.
    Comparing 1956 with 1949 before liberation: Longchong Township had a bumper harvest in 1949, and was not severely damaged by the war during the People's Liberation War. Township cadres and typical households said that 1949 was considered a good year in the four or five years before liberation. But 1956 was much better than 1949. In 1956, the number of households living a life above the middle level was 508, accounting for 82.9% of the total number of households; in 1949, the number of households living a life above the middle level was 199, accounting for 32.4% of the total number of households. The average net income per person of middle-income households in 1956 was 67 yuan, while the average net income per person of middle-income households in 1949 was less than 60 yuan (calculated in RMB).
    According to the investigation of 12 typical households, the average net income per person in 1956 was as high as 86.4 yuan, while the average net income per person for the same households and the same people in 1949 was only 59.9 yuan.
    This general upward trend in net income can also be seen from the figures of production development. With the same amount of rice fields, the total output of rice in the township in 1949 was 1.3 million jin, which increased to 1.98 million jin in 1956. The total income from sideline occupations in the township in 1956 decreased by 13% compared to 1949. However, rice field income was the main income for farmers in Longchong Township in both years.
    Comparing 1956 with 1949, the net income figure has increased significantly when averaged among households and individuals, but the net income of a few households has decreased. In addition to the 40 landlords and rich peasants whose income naturally decreased entirely, the net income of about one hundred old middle peasants and poor peasants has also decreased slightly. According to the investigation of 48 households with decreased net income, the average decrease was about 20%, with the largest decrease for upper-middle peasants, smaller for lower-middle peasants, and even smaller for poor peasants.

    龙冲乡农民生活状况调查报告
    杜导正　郑世文　刘汉　方静波
    广东省高要县龙冲乡，和县里旁的乡村比较，论工作，算中上等；论生产条件和生活程度，属于中下等。中共高要县委和许多区乡干部都认为，它能代表多数乡村。
    我们在龙冲乡调查了三个星期。这篇文字所用的材料，全是调查得来的。里边，12户典型户的材料，是户主屈指计算，细细恳谈，又经过我们实地观察过的。别的户的材料，是乡村干部一户户计算的。全部材料，都经过几个主要乡干部的反复核对。
    一、农民生活到底过得去？
    过不去？
    这是我们调查的首要项目。调查结果，可以概括为两个基本数字：86.7比13.3。100人里，过得去的有86.7人，过不去的有13.3人。仔细点说，过得去的是：富裕户44户195人，中等户464户1840人，两类共508户2035人，占全村总人数的86.7％。过不去的是：困难户77户282人，五保户28户31人，两类困难户共105户313人，占全村总人数的13.3％。
    这里说的富裕户，中等户和困难户，是纯粹按生活程度的高低分的。富裕户去年每人平均有纯收入87元，中等户每人平均有纯收入67元，困难户每人平均有纯收入50元，五保户每人有四百多斤谷的收入。
    不过，根据12户有代表性的典型户的精确调查，上边说的富裕户、中等户的收入数字偏低些，困难户的收入数字又偏高些。典型调查的结果是：富裕户每人去年有117.4元的纯收入，中等户每人去年有76.1元的纯收入，困难户每人去年纯收入只有41.2元。
    富裕户过着相当于旧富裕中农的生活。去年，3户富裕典型户13人，每人平均有纯收入117.4元。在农村，一个人一个月有近十元的纯收入，生活就是富裕的了。就以稍低的全村统计数字每人87元收入计算，一个人一个月有七、八元的纯收入，生活也是宽裕的。他们口粮足够，吃菜讲究，衣服新，用具好，手头松动。一个叫李晚的富裕户，3口人，去年一年光猪肉吃了31斤。其它富裕户每人每月都吃到六、七两食油，六、七两猪肉。有的富裕户现在已经准备盖新屋，有的已经盖了新屋。
    464户中等户，过着相当于老下中农的生活。所谓老下中农的生活，据当地农民说，那就是：一个人（农忙农闲和大口小口都平均计算）一个月能吃到47斤稻谷，15斤蕃薯和芋头，五两油，五两肉，半斤盐和15斤蔬菜。另有二角钱的糖、粉、火柴等杂支（烧柴全部自给，收入和支出均未计入）。此外，老下中农每人一年要添三件新衣，一双木屐。两年要添一顶草帽，一件蓑衣。一年还得花用医药、煤油、添修农具、抽烟、杂支5元左右。
    以上这些东西按当地市价一项项计算，伙食共需4.74元，一年共需56.88元。穿、用12元。食、穿、用共68.88元。
    去年，全乡中等户每人平均有纯收入67元，和老下中农一年开支标准数字是大体一致的。事实上，绝大多数中等户的生活是达到或略略超过这个食、穿、用的水平的。根据调查，他们去年口粮足够，每人平均添置了一件半单衣，一件内衣（线背心或短裤），只是医药、杂用开支较那个标准数字多些。油、肉消费数字比那个标准数字低些。
    值得注意的是，中等户收支只能勉强平衡，没有积蓄。因此经受不起医药、办红白事等较大的额外开支。七个典型的中等户中，有两户去年每人平均纯收入都在75元以上，但是各有一个全劳动力病了，各用医药费70元以上，家庭纯收入开销掉这一笔巨款后，供每个人实际开支的纯收入，即由75元下降到56元左右。两户的生活便较别的中等户困难不少。去年一年内，基本上没有添置新衣服，还都欠了几十元的债。
    全乡464户中等户中，类似这两户，因为额外开支有了亏空，生活紧些的，估计约有一百户左右。
    困难户生活的特点是口粮不足。77户困难户，一般都缺3个月左右的口粮，一年内基本上没有添置过一件新衣服。困难户蒋三家，全年缺3个月的口粮。他家7口人，一年内只给老婆买过一条围裙。
    五保户由乡农业生产合作社每月每人给谷30斤到35斤，钱5角。大多数五保户还多少能在合作社赚到一点工分，过着一日一餐稀粥一餐干饭的生活。
    二、农民生活现在好？
    过去好？
    龙冲乡1949年底解放，1953年初完成土地改革，1956年初全乡合作化。这是三个大变化，三个大阶段。比生活，就拿这三个阶段具体地比。
    比的时候，必须考虑到天年和人口增长特别是天年对纯收入消长情况的重要影响。龙冲乡1956年早造、晚造遇到老年人有记忆以来最大的旱灾。1955年早造大旱。1953年全年风调雨顺大丰收。1949年晚造，许多村因堤围崩溃遭大水灾，这个村恰是早晚两造大丰收。1946年到现在，除过上边那些情况外，别的年头普普通通。人口数字，过去的没有资料可查，1952年是2200人，1956年底是2348人，增长了7％。
    先拿合作化后但是早晚两造受到大旱的1956年，同合作化前单干时只是早造受到大旱的1955年比较。1956年，12户各种类型的典型户，每人平均纯收入达86.4元；1955年，同数同类的典型户，每人平均纯收入是67.7元，比1956年少18.7元。其中3户富裕户1956年每人平均纯收入117.4元，7户中等户每人平均纯收入76.1元，2户困难户每人平均纯收入41.2元；1955年同是这些户，富裕户每人纯收入103.8元，比1956年少13.6元，中等户每人纯收入62.2元，比1956年少13.9元，困难户每人纯收入33.3元，比1956年少7.9元。
    就全乡总的情况看，1956年过着相当于上中农生活的富裕户是44户，1955年上中农（新、老在内）只34户。1956年过着相当于下中农生活的中等户是464户，1955年新、老下中农是296户。1956年的困难户虽然仍过着相当于贫农的生活，但大多数的纯收入也比1955年略略提高。
    我们在龙冲乡接触十个人，就有九个人异口同声地说：去年那么大旱灾，大家还增加了收入，实在料想不到！
    当然，这些都是指总情况、总收入、总平均数字说的。那12户典型户中，实际上有两户（一户现在是富裕户，合作化前的新上中农；一户现在是中等户，合作化前的新下中农）因为劳动力害病或增添人口，1956年纯收入比1955年下降了11％。全村1956年纯收入较1955年下降的户数和下降的幅度，大体上和典型户情况一致，下降户约占总户数10％—15％，纯收入下降幅度为10％左右。
    1956年同1953年比：1953年是龙冲乡完成土地改革后的第一年，是风调雨顺大丰收，农民生产积极性很高的一年，加上那年分到了斗争果实，农民把这一年叫做“黄金年”。乡干部和农民凭印象估计说，1953年纯收入比1955年多，1956年恢复了1953年的元气，但纯收入不会超过1953年。
    可是12户典型户的精确调查却表明，1953年的纯收入虽然超过1955年，但低于1956年。1953年每人平均纯收入是79元，比1955年的每人平均纯收入67.7元高出11.3元，但比1956年的每人平均纯收入86.4元却低了7.4元。
    1953年纯收入比1955年多的主要原因，是前者风调雨顺大丰收，后者的早造大旱，3602亩早稻中有1000亩失收。另外，1953年冬开始的粮食统购统销中，口粮、饲料没有留足，猪、鸡等副业收入显著减少了。1956年早造、晚造虽然大旱，但合作化以后，财力人力安排得合理，水利办得特别好，修了一条3里半长的水渠，建了6个水塘，2800亩历史性的受旱田减至1200亩，战胜了大旱，本来要大歉收的年景反赚来一个大丰收，全年产稻谷198万斤，不仅比1955年的120万斤高出78万斤，而且比风调雨顺的1953年的173万斤高出25万斤。另外，1956年口粮够了，饲料粮有了改善，家庭副业较1955年发展了。
    1956年和解放前的1949年比：龙冲乡1949年大丰收，人民解放战争中又没有受到战争严重的破坏。乡干部和典型户说，1949年在解放前的四、五个年头中，算好年头。但1956年比1949年好得多。1956年过着中等以上生活的户数是508户，占总户数的82.9％；1949年过着中等以上生活的户数是199户，占总户数的32.4％。1956年中等户每人平均纯收入是67元，1949年中等户每人平均纯收入不足60元（折成人民币计算）。
    据12户典型户的调查，1956年每个人平均纯收入高达86.4元，而同样是这些户这些人，1949年每人平均纯收入只59.9元。
    这个纯收入上升的总状况，也能从生产发展的数字中看出来。同样多的稻田，1949年全乡共产稻谷130万斤，1956年增至198万斤。全乡副业收入1956年比1949年则减少13％。不过稻田收入不论那一年都是龙冲乡农民的主要收入。
    1956年比1949年，把纯收入数字以各户各人平均开来看，是显著上升了，但少数户的纯收入却是下降了的。除过40户地主、富农理所当然的全部下降以外，有一百户左右的老中农和贫农纯收入也稍稍下降了些。根据48户纯收入下降户的调查，下降幅度平均为20％左右，其中上中农下降幅度最大，下中农小些，贫农更小些。
                      （待续）
