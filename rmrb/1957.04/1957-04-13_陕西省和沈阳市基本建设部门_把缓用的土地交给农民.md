Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 12th -- After adjusting their basic construction plans for this year, thirty-nine construction units in Shaanxi Province have handed over more than 13,000 mu of land that is temporarily unused or surplus to local people's committees for distribution to agricultural production cooperatives for cultivation.

The local state-owned Xi'an Textile Factory, the joint state-private New Northwest Printing and Dyeing Factory, and two other factories, reserved more than 90 mu of land for welfare construction when they were built, but these factories have not expanded. Not long ago, these factories handed over the surplus land to agricultural cooperatives for use. The Xi'an Electrical Manufacturing School, which was originally scheduled to start construction in January of this year, postponed its construction task. The construction unit voluntarily returned more than 80 mu of purchased land to the original agricultural cooperative for use. Four factories near Xianyang handed over more than 4,200 mu of land where basic construction will not be carried out this year to the local government. This land has now been deep-plowed by agricultural cooperatives in preparation for sowing cotton and other crops. Five factories in the Baoji area have returned 170 mu of temporarily unused and surplus land to the government for allocation to local agricultural cooperatives.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 12th -- Before the spring ploughing and sowing season, the Shenyang City Land Management Department recovered land that was excessively occupied by basic construction units and land that will not be used before the autumn, and allowed farmers to cultivate it. The brick and tile kiln units under the Shenyang City Industrial Bureau have handed over all 1,500 mu of kiln land that has been abandoned for three years to the local people's committee. The farmers are now preparing to cultivate these kiln lands.

Before the spring plowing, the Shenyang City Land Management Department supervised various construction units, according to the spirit of fully utilizing wasteland and vacant land and not occupying farmland and vegetable gardens, and reduced unreasonable land occupation plans. For example, the Jiangong Street Open Channel project originally planned to occupy ten mu of cultivated land to fill earthwork. Now the Shenyang City Urban Construction Bureau has decided to transport the earthwork to the farther wasteland as much as possible. In addition, the land use plans for some road and ditch projects that have been slowed down have also been reduced, so that more than 180 mu of farmland that was scheduled to be requisitioned can continue to be cultivated by farmers.

    陕西省和沈阳市基本建设部门
    把缓用的土地交给农民
    新华社西安12日电　陕西省有三十九个建设单位在调整了今年的基本建设计划以后，把暂时不用的和剩余的一万三千多亩土地，交由当地人民委员会分配给农业生产合作社耕种。
    地方国营西安纺织厂、公私合营新西北印染厂等四个工厂，在建厂时保留了九十多亩福利建设用地，但是这几个工厂一直没有进行扩建。不久以前，这些工厂把这些多余的土地交给了农业社使用。原计划在今年1月动工建设的西安电器制造学校，因为建筑任务推迟，建设单位主动地把征购的八十多亩土地，又退还给原来的农业社使用。咸阳附近的四个工厂把今年不进行基本建设的四千二百多亩土地交给当地政府，现在这些土地已经由农业社进行深耕，准备播种棉花等农作物。宝鸡地区的五个工厂把暂时不用和剩余的一百七十亩土地交还政府拨给当地农业社使用。
    据新华社沈阳12日电　沈阳市土地主管部门在春耕春播前，从基本建设单位收回占用过多的和今年秋天以前不用的土地，让给农民耕种。沈阳市工业局所属各砖瓦窑业单位，把三年来废弃了的一千五百亩窑地，全部交给地方人民委员会。现在农民正准备耕种这些窑地。
    春耕以前，沈阳市土地主管部门监督各建设单位，根据充分利用废地、空地，不占农田、菜园的精神，削减了不合理的占地计划。如奖工街明渠工程，原来计划占用十亩耕地铺填土方，现在沈阳市城市建设局已经决定尽一切可能把土方运送到较远的废地上去。此外，还削减了一些缓建的道路、沟渠的用地计划，使预定征用的一百八十多亩农田继续由农民耕种。
