A Great Exchange of Wisdom and Experience
Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of Culture of the People's Republic of China

Currently, the people of China are welcoming the visit of Comrade Voroshilov, Head of State and Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of our great ally, the Soviet Union, with particular joy. This visit will undoubtedly further consolidate and develop the greatest brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples, and will further promote friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union in political, economic, and cultural fields. Here, let us express our highest respect to Comrade Voroshilov, an outstanding Soviet political activist. At the same time, we express our heartfelt gratitude to the great Soviet people who have always sympathized with and supported our people in carrying out revolution and construction.

Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out emphatically at the founding meeting of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association in 1949 that the people of China and the Soviet Union should strive to exchange all the wisdom and experience of the two great nations, enhance the brotherly friendship and cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union, and be conducive to the cause of world peace and human progress.

Our Cultural Exchanges and Cooperation Have Already Achieved Significant Results

It should be said that the people of China and the Soviet Union have already done tremendous work in exchanging each other's wisdom and experience over the past eight years. Sino-Soviet cultural exchanges and cooperation have mainly done this work. In the past eight years, China has published many works by Lenin, many works by Stalin, and is currently publishing the Complete Works of Lenin and the Complete Works of Stalin. The Soviet Union has also published many important documents of the CPC Central Committee; the Soviet Union has also published the Selected Works of Mao Zedong and several important documents of the CPC Central Committee. In the past eight years, China has translated more than 12,400 kinds of Soviet books, with more than 190 million copies printed. In the past six years, the Soviet Union has published 370 kinds of works by Chinese writers in Russian, with approximately 20 million copies printed; works by Chinese writers have been translated into more than 30 ethnic languages of the Soviet Union. From 1949 to 1956, a total of 21 Soviet art troupes, with 1,219 people, visited and performed in China at the invitation of our country; a total of 21 Chinese art troupes, with 983 people, visited and performed in the Soviet Union at the invitation of the Soviet side. In addition, Sino-Soviet scientific cooperation, the mutual dispatch of students (China has sent more than 6,300 students to the Soviet Union), the exchange and screening of films, and cooperation in news, broadcasting, health, sports and other undertakings have all yielded significant results.

It should be particularly pointed out that last year and this year are important years in the development of Sino-Soviet cultural cooperation. Last year, the Soviet government sent a group of outstanding scientists to China to help Chinese scientists formulate a twelve-year plan for the development of scientific research. At the same time, it provided great assistance to China in developing research on atomic energy. In July last year, delegations from the Chinese and Soviet governments held talks in Moscow and signed the Sino-Soviet Cultural Cooperation Agreement. This agreement stipulates that China and the Soviet Union will "make every effort to consolidate and develop cultural cooperation between China and the Soviet Union," with the aim of "further strengthening the profound brotherly friendship between the two peoples, promoting the rapid development of cultural construction in both countries, and safeguarding world peace and the cause of human progress." The agreement also summarized the experience of Sino-Soviet cultural exchanges in the past few years and stipulated the general task and specific tasks of "consolidating and developing cooperation between the two countries in science, technology, education, literature, art, health care, sports, news, publishing, broadcasting, and television." Obviously, this agreement is an important milestone in Sino-Soviet cultural cooperation, and from then on, cultural cooperation between the two countries will enter a new stage that is more comprehensive, in-depth, and planned.

We happily recall that in January of this year, the Soviet government specially dispatched a cultural delegation headed by Comrade Mikhailov, the Soviet Minister of Culture, to China to negotiate and sign the 1957 Sino-Soviet Cultural Cooperation Implementation Plan in accordance with the Cultural Cooperation Agreement. They not only successfully completed their tasks, but also had cordial conversations with Chinese comrades on many important issues in the cultural construction of the two countries. We all expressed at the time of parting that it was very beneficial for both parties to be able to exchange views on major issues in the construction of new socialist cultures in such a serious, frank, and in-depth manner.

We all recognize that to carry out cultural cooperation smoothly, we need not only diligent work, but also a more comprehensive and long-term perspective and plan.

Our Goal is to Promote the Socialist Cultures of China and the Soviet Union

The Sino-Soviet Cultural Cooperation Agreement stipulates that an important goal of our cooperation is to promote the rapid development of cultural construction in both countries. So, what kind of culture are we building? The people of China and the Soviet Union, like the people of all socialist countries, are striving to build a great socialist culture. There is no doubt that the culture we are going to create and build must be a culture that serves the working people, a culture that serves socialist and communist construction, and a culture that serves the cause of peace and progress for all mankind. Otherwise, it will be incompatible with the foundation of the society we are building, and it will not be commensurate with our glorious mission. Here, the exchange of advanced cultures between China and the Soviet Union, especially China's learning of the advanced socialist culture of the Soviet Union, is of extremely important significance.

As an important experience, in carrying out cultural exchanges and promoting cultural construction in both countries, we should selectively absorb each other's advanced culture and apply it creatively. For forty years, the Chinese people have been enthusiastically yearning for the advanced socialist culture of the Soviet Union, and since Lu Xun and Qu Qiubai, they have introduced the new culture of the Soviet Union to the Chinese people in large quantities. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, we launched another upsurge of learning from the Soviet Union. In short, the Chinese people have learned Marxism-Leninism from the Soviet Union, learned the real revolution—the revolution of the masses of the people led by the ideology of the working class, and also learned the real construction—the planned socialist construction based on the interests of the working people. Although we have had shortcomings in the process of learning Marxism-Leninism and Soviet experience that were not sufficiently combined with China's reality, we have paid attention to overcoming these shortcomings and are continuing to work hard to overcome them. This must not prevent us from continuing to earnestly and systematically learn all the advanced experiences and advanced culture of the Soviet Union.

We Must Also Absorb the Excellent Cultures of All Nations in the World; Our Cultural Construction Will Be Rapid and Fruitful

Naturally, our socialist cultural construction must absorb all the excellent cultural heritage in human history. Therefore, our cultural exchanges are by no means limited to the outstanding modern cultures of China and the Soviet Union, but must also exchange the outstanding ancient cultures of the two countries; nor are they limited to absorbing the excellent cultures of the socialist camp countries, but must also systematically and step by step absorb the outstanding ancient and modern cultures of all nations in the world. Therefore, we will never allow a conservative closed-door policy to be adopted in carrying out cultural exchanges. We should not adopt a rejecting attitude towards the excellent cultures of capitalist countries either. In this regard, since we put forward the policies of "Letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend" and "Marching towards science" last year, we have taken active measures to absorb the scientific and cultural achievements of various countries in the world that are beneficial to our people. Our Soviet comrades have also been adopting very positive attitudes and effective measures in this regard in recent years. We believe that this will have a significant positive impact on the cultural construction of China and the Soviet Union.

We and our Soviet colleagues have completely consistent views on the future of socialist culture and communist culture. Socialist culture is gradually built on the basis of the development of productive forces in socialist society. Because the nature of socialist relations of production is basically adapted to the development of productive forces, the development of productive forces in the Soviet Union and various socialist countries is many times faster than that in capitalist countries. Following this, the construction of socialist culture will naturally be many times faster than that in capitalist countries. But the socialist system is still a very young system after all, and socialist productive forces, even in the Soviet Union, have not yet reached the stage of full development. Let us imagine, in a few decades, a hundred years, or two hundred years, when our productive forces far exceed the level of the most developed capitalist countries, and if we add our correct efforts, what height will our socialist culture and communist culture reach at that time! When we look at the cultures of the feudal era and the capitalist era again, it will be like climbing Mount Everest to look at small hills.

Let us work harder to strengthen cultural cooperation between China and the Soviet Union to build such a brilliant socialist culture and communist culture!

Long live the great and eternal Sino-Soviet friendly cooperation!

    伟大的智慧和经验之交流
    中华人民共和国文化部副部长  钱俊瑞
    现在我们全中国人民正在以特别高兴的心情，欢迎我们伟大盟邦苏联的元首、最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫同志的访问我国。这次访问无疑地将进一步巩固和发展中苏两国人民的最伟大的兄弟友谊，并且将更加促进中苏两国在政治、经济、文化方面的友好合作。在这里让我们向苏联杰出的政治活动家伏罗希洛夫同志表示最崇高的敬意。同时向一贯同情和支持我国人民进行革命和建设的伟大的苏联人民表示衷心的深切的感谢。
    刘少奇同志在1949年中苏友好协会总会成立大会上曾经着重地指出，中苏两国人民应该努力交流两大民族的一切智慧和经验，增进中苏两国人民的兄弟般的友谊和合作，有利于世界和平和人类进步的事业。
    我们的文化交流和合作已经有了重大收获
    应该说，中苏两国人民八年来在交流双方的智慧和经验方面已经做了十分巨大的工作。中苏两国的文化交流和合作主要地就是做了这方面的工作。八年来我国出版了列宁的许多著作，斯大林的许多著作，并且正在出版列宁全集和斯大林全集，还出版了苏共中央的许多重要文献；苏联也出版了毛泽东选集和中共中央的若干重要文献。过去八年中，我国翻译了苏联各种书籍一万二千四百多种，印行一亿九千多万册。苏联在最近六年中用俄文出版了中国作家的作品三百七十种，印行约二千万册；中国作家的作品已译成苏联三十多种民族文字。从1949年到1956年应我国邀请来访问演出的苏联艺术团体共二十一个，一千二百一十九人；我国应苏方邀请到苏联作访问演出的艺术团体共二十一个，九百八十三人。此外，中苏两国科学家的合作，留学生的相互派遣（我国派赴苏联的留学生已达六千三百多人），影片的交换放映，新闻、广播、卫生、体育等事业的合作，都有了重大的收获。
    特别应该指出，去年和今年是中苏文化合作发展中的重要年头。去年苏联政府派出了一批杰出的科学家来到我国，帮助我国科学家拟订十二年科学研究发展的规划。同时，对我国发展原子能的研究又给予巨大的帮助。去年7月，我国政府和苏联政府的代表团在莫斯科举行了谈判，签订了中苏文化合作协定。这个协定规定中苏双方“全力巩固和发展中苏两国的文化合作关系”，其目的在于“进一步加强两国人民兄弟般的深厚友谊，促进两国文化建设的迅速发展，维护世界和平和人类进步事业”。协定还总结了过去几年中苏文化交流的经验，规定了“巩固和发展两国间的科学、技术、教育、文学、艺术、保健、体育、新闻、出版、广播、电视事业的合作”的总的任务和各项具体任务。很显然，这一协定是中苏文化合作中的重要里程碑，从此两国文化合作将进入更加全面、深入和更有计划的新阶段。
    我们愉快地回忆到，今年1月苏联政府为了根据文化合作协定谈判和签订1957年的中苏文化合作执行计划，特地派遣了以苏联文化部长米哈伊洛夫同志为首的文化代表团来到中国。他们不仅完满地完成了自己的任务，而且和中国同志们关于两国文化建设中许多重要问题作了亲切的交谈。我们在临别时都表示，双方对建设社会主义新文化的重大问题能够如此严肃地、坦率地和深入地交换意见，对双方都是十分有益的。
    我们都认识到，要顺利地进行文化合作，不仅需要勤勉的工作，还需要比较全面和长远的看法和规划。
    我们的目的是促进中苏两国社会主义文化
    中苏文化合作协定规定了我们的合作的一个重要目的是促进两国文化建设的迅速发展。那么，我们究竟是在建设什么样子的文化呢？中苏两国人民，和所有社会主义各国的人民一样，都在努力建设伟大的社会主义文化。毫无疑问，我们所要创造和建设的文化必须是为劳动人民服务的文化，是为社会主义和共产主义建设服务的文化，是为全人类的和平和进步事业服务的文化。否则，它便和我们所建设的社会的基础不相适应，便和我们的光荣任务不相称。在这里，中苏两国先进文化的交流，特别是我国学习苏联先进的社会主义文化，就具有极其重要的意义。
    作为一条重要的经验来说，实行文化交流，促进两国的文化建设，我们应该有选择地吸收对方的先进文化，而加以创造性的运用。中国人民四十年来热烈向往着苏联的先进的社会主义文化，从鲁迅、瞿秋白起就大量地向中国人民介绍苏联的新文化。中华人民共和国成立以后，我们又掀起了学习苏联的热潮。总之，中国人民从苏联学到了马克思列宁主义，学到了真正的革命——以工人阶级思想为领导的人民群众的革命，也学到了真正的建设——以劳动人民的利益为依归的有计划的社会主义建设。尽管我们在学习马克思列宁主义和苏联经验的过程中曾经有过结合我国实际不够的缺点，但是这种缺点我们已经注意加以克服，并且正在继续努力克服。这决不能妨碍我们继续认真地、有系统地学习苏联的一切先进经验和先进文化。
    我们也必须吸收世界上一切民族的优秀文化；我们的文化建设必将是迅速的、有成果的
    自然，我们建设社会主义文化必须吸收人类历史上一切优秀的文化遗产。因此，我们的文化交流决不局限于中苏两国现代的优秀文化，还必须交流两国古代的优秀文化；也不局限于吸收现在社会主义阵营各国的优秀文化，而且必须有计划有步骤地吸收世界上一切民族的古代和现代的优秀文化。因此，我们实行文化交流，决不容许采取保守的闭关政策。我们对于资本主义各国的优秀文化，也不应该采取拒绝的态度。在这一方面，我们从去年提出“百花齐放、百家争鸣”和“向科学进军”的方针以后，就采取积极的措施，吸收世界各国的对我国人民有益的科学文化成就。我们的苏联同志们近年来在这方面也在采取非常积极的态度和有效的措施。我们相信，这对于中苏两国的文化建设将会发生重大的积极影响。
    我们和苏联的同事们对于社会主义文化和共产主义文化的未来抱有完全一致的看法。社会主义文化是在社会主义社会的生产力发展的基础上逐步建设起来的。由于社会主义的生产关系的性质基本上适应于生产力的发展，因此在苏联和各个社会主义国家，生产力的发展要比资本主义国家快上好多倍。跟着来的，社会主义文化的建设也自然会比资本主义国家快上好多倍。但是社会主义制度直到如今毕竟还是一个十分年轻的制度，社会主义的生产力，即使在苏联也远还没有达到充分发展的程度。让我们设想，在几十年、一百年、二百年之后，当我们的生产力远远超过资本主义最发达国家的水平之后，如果再加上我们正确的努力，那时我们的社会主义文化和共产主义文化将达到怎样的高度啊！到那时我们再来看看封建时代和资本主义时代的文化，那正像登上喜马拉雅山而来看小小的丘陵了。
    让我们更加努力加强中苏两国的文化合作，来建设这样光辉灿烂的社会主义文化和共产主义文化吧！
    伟大的永恒的中苏友好合作万岁！
