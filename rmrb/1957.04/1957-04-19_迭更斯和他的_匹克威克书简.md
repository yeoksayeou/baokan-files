Dickens and His "Pickwick Papers"
Sun Dayu

Charles Dickens, the great English novelist, was born in 1812 in Landport, Hampshire, in southern England. His father was a clerk in the pay office of the Portsmouth naval base. In 1814, the family moved to London, and three years later moved again to Chatham, a town thirty miles southeast of London. Due to poverty, he did not receive much education. His father was imprisoned in the Marshalsea debtors' prison for debt, and the eleven-year-old child had to work as an apprentice in a shoe polish factory to make a living. Later, the situation improved slightly, and he entered a privately run secondary school for less than two years. At the age of fifteen, he worked as an apprentice in a law firm for more than a year. Feeling that there was no future, he learned and became proficient in shorthand. From 1830, he worked as a reporter for several newspapers, covering debates in the House of Commons.

In 1833, he began writing and publishing character sketches, which were later published as a book titled "Sketches by Boz," rich in humor and satire. Subsequently, a publisher sought a collection of humorous stories, with illustrations to be added. Dickens wrote "The Pickwick Papers" (note) in response to the request. The entire book was published in twenty monthly installments, starting in April 1836, when the author was only twenty-four years old. In this work, Dickens had fully matured as a writer of humor and satire; his instant fame also made him financially comfortable. Mr. Pickwick can be said to be the Don Quixote of the 19th century in England; Sam Weller is equivalent to the sidekick Sancho Panza, and this book is worthy of being the most hilarious masterpiece in English literature. Dickens got married after the first book was published. After publishing a few issues of "The Papers," he stopped working as a news reporter and lived entirely as a writer until his death.

Following this was "Oliver Twist," serialized in a magazine from 1837 to 1838, which depicted the life of a poor orphan who was starved, frozen, and abused in an orphanage. After working as an apprentice for a while, he escaped to London and fell into the hands of a group of thieves, robbers, and pickpockets, experiencing all kinds of hardships. Finally, the criminals and those who harmed him were caught, and he himself was rescued and restored to his rightful inheritance. "Nicholas Nickleby," published monthly from 1838 to 1839, tells the story of a generous, brave, and promising young man who struggles with his miserly uncle in extremely difficult circumstances and finally achieves victory. "The Old Curiosity Shop" was published in 1841, narrating the encounters of Little Nell and her grandfather, who owned an antique shop. This kind old and young pair, unable to bear the heavy burden, was tormented by a vicious moneylender named Quilp. Finally, help came too late to save them, and the grandfather and granddaughter died one after another.

At the enthusiastic invitation of his friend, the American essayist Washington Irving, Dickens traveled to the United States in 1842. After returning to his country, he immediately published his two-volume "American Notes," which contained criticisms of the irrational phenomena of American society. From 1843 to 1845, "Martin Chuzzlewit" was published monthly, telling the story of Martin, the grandson of an old and world-weary wealthy man, who was expelled from the family because he fell in love with the old man's adopted daughter. Martin went to the United States with his servant Mark Tapley to seek his fortune, but was swindled by a fraudulent land development company. Master and servant had to return to England. At the same time, his grandfather discovered the despicable and insidious actions of his cousin Pecksniff, exposed that hypocrite, and the grandfather and grandson reconciled, and the pair of lovers were reunited. His criticisms of the system of enslaving blacks and satire of the American way of life in the book greatly angered some of his new American friends.

Starting with the heartwarming and morally persuasive "A Christmas Carol" in 1843, he published a Christmas story every year until 1848. Dickens traveled to Italy and France twice, continuing to work tirelessly during his travels, and achieved fruitful results. "David Copperfield" was published monthly from 1849 to 1850, depicting the lives of poor working people. Many parts are veiled autobiographies of the author. This book was his own favorite work. Then came "Bleak House" in 1852 to 1853, which satirized the Chancery Court's endless delays in lawsuits, while lawyers swallowed up the property of the parties involved. The character that runs through the entire novel is the pure and lovely Esther Summerson, an illegitimate daughter of a noble lady. "Little Dorrit" was published monthly from 1857 to 1858, narrating the story of the innocent Little Dorrit (her father was an old inmate of the Marshalsea debtors' prison), who was born in prison. When the whole family inherited a large fortune, she fell in love with Clennam, an old friend of her father and daughter during their suffering. At this time, he had already gone bankrupt, was imprisoned, and was poor and sick. He could not accept Little Dorrit's love because they were too far apart in wealth. Finally, the Dorrit family's wealth was completely destroyed, Clennam was released from prison, and the two were able to satisfy their love. The book most forcefully criticizes imprisonment for debt, the Tite Barnacle's Circumlocution Office that never gets anything done (bureaucracy), man-eating theology, and the collective hypocrisy of upper-class society. "A Tale of Two Cities," published in 1859, is set against the backdrop of the French Revolution, narrating the experiences of a doctor. Because he knew the fact that a French Marquis and his brother had raped a woman and committed murder, he was imprisoned in the Bastille prison for eighteen years. By the time the revolution broke out, he was released from prison and had gone mad. He was rescued to London and finally regained his sanity. The Marquis's nephew (who was precisely the result of that evil relationship) hated the tyranny of the French aristocracy, broke away from his relatives and friends, changed his name, came to England, fell in love with the doctor's daughter Lucy, and got married. This young man returned to Paris to rescue his servant who had been wronged, was arrested in the chaos of the revolution and sentenced to death. He was exchanged by a friend who looked exactly like him, and he returned to England, while that friend went to the guillotine as a substitute. There is also "Great Expectations," published in Dickens's own weekly "All the Year Round" from 1860 to 1861, which has already been made into a film in the UK. It was shown in our country some time ago, titled "Great Expectations." The story will not be introduced here.

From 1858, Dickens publicly recited excerpts from some of his works, which were very popular with the masses. From 1867 to 1868, he traveled to the United States for the second time. In the spring of 1870, he suddenly passed away while writing "The Mystery of Edwin Drood." He was fifty-eight years old at the time. His collected works consist of twenty-two volumes, mainly fourteen works, most of which have been given extremely brief introductions above.

Dickens lived in the era of the transition of British capitalism to imperialism, witnessing the miasma and utter darkness of social life. Although he was not a Marxist revolutionary writer, the voice of human justice was loudly shouted out in his works. His joy and love are sincere and powerful, simple and innocent, and his anger and hatred are unambiguous and hit the nail on the head. His sympathy is always on the side of those who are abused, insulted, and bullied. He has no connection with the beneficiaries who started by exploiting and oppressing others. He does not start from dogma, but opposes all unfair and unreasonable phenomena. He shows extreme contempt and sharp satire for those who do evil by relying on the power of their position and wealth. In "The Pickwick Papers," he criticizes the prison conditions, the corruption of elections, and the boring and despicable squabbles between the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party and within each party. In "Oliver Twist," he criticizes the darkness of orphanages and nursing homes, as well as the Poor Law and vicious charity that created that situation. In "Nicholas Nickleby," he criticizes the "Yorkshire" school teachers who specialize in abusing children. In "Bleak House," he criticizes the Chancery Court of England at that time. In "Little Dorrit," he criticizes the Tite Barnacle's Circumlocution Office and the worship of money. In "Hard Times," he criticizes utilitarianism, the Manchester School, and the Malthusian theory of population, which Dickens collectively calls the Gradgrind philosophy. All of these criticisms earned him the title of radical in that optimistic and complacent Victorian English society. Although those gentlemen in tailcoats and kid gloves felt that he pricked them very painfully, and believed that his works neither praised the Middle Ages nor praised God, and were not worthy of being placed in the hall of elegance; however, his surging and vast works still had a great practical impact, played a role in improving many bad situations, and were loved by the vast majority of people, who burst into laughter, applauded, or sobbed uncontrollably as they read them.

Now let us introduce the content of "The Pickwick Papers" in more detail. Samuel Pickwick is the president of the Pickwick Club, which he founded. The club assumes that he and three other members, named Tupman, Snodgrass, and Winkle, form a correspondence group to report their experiences of traveling and adventuring abroad, and their observations on characters, customs, and habits to the club in the form of letters. These written reports of roaming, exploring, and hunting for curiosities are collected and compiled into a book. Thus, the club becomes a link or key that connects a series of unrelated events and many frequently changing characters. Therefore, as the author said in the preface, the structure of the novel is inevitably loose, and the progress of the story cannot have a tight organization due to the limitations of the publication situation. The interesting experiences encountered by Mr. Pickwick and his companions are interspersed with several stories told by various characters, so the entire book appears even more colorful and neat. The main body of the story has the following eleven clues: (1) Pickwick and his friends go to Rochester, encounter the villain Jingle, who looks decent on the surface but is actually terrible, who almost made Winkle fight a duel, fortunately it didn't happen. (2) Visit the hospitable Mr. Wardle in Dingley Dell; the villain Jingle elopes with Wardle's sister, Wardle and Pickwick go together to chase her back; Pickwick hires Sam Weller as his servant. (3) Go to Eatanswill, where a parliamentary election is taking place, Pickwick meets a newspaper editor, Mr. Pott. (4) Go to Bury St. Edmunds, where Pickwick and Sam Weller are tricked by Jingle and his servant Job Trotter. (5) Chase Jingle to Ipswich, where Pickwick unintentionally breaks into the bedroom of a middle-aged woman at night; then quarrels with the woman's lover, Mr. Peter Magnus; is taken to the sheriff Nupkins and is accused of attempting to provoke a duel; Pickwick reveals Jingle's bad intentions of trying to play tricks on the sheriff's daughter, and is therefore released. (6) The Christmas celebration scene in Dingley Dell. (7) Mr. Pickwick's landlady misunderstands his meaning, resulting in a lawsuit. Mrs. Bardell accuses Pickwick of breach of promise of marriage, the plaintiff wins the case, and the defendant is ordered to pay damages of seven hundred and fifty pounds. (8) Go to Bath for sightseeing, Winkle is the protagonist of this trip, first he deals with the bragging Dowler, then he proposes to Arabella Allen. (9) Mr. Pickwick is imprisoned in the Fleet Prison because he refuses to pay the breach of promise compensation fee and the court costs borne by the losing party; he finds Jingle and his servant Job Trotter in prison, and he still helps them. (10) The matter of Pickwick's servant Sam Weller's father and stepmother, the stepmother has just died, and before her death she revealed a secret; the sanctimonious teetotaler preacher Abner, the pious bullshit and greedy drunkard Stiggins, gets a good beating from Old Weller and his head is pressed into a trough full of water for a good dousing. (11) The affairs of the two medical students Bob Sawyer and Benjamin Allen. The whole book ends with the marriage of Allen's sister Arabella and Winkle.

The above is a brief content of the novel "The Pickwick Papers." For some of our readers, these plots may seem too unconnected and the structure of the story too scattered. But if we think of novels such as "Journey to the West," "Flowers in the Mirror," and "Don Quixote," we will feel that "The Pickwick Papers" has similarities with them. The British film "The Adventures of Mr. Pickwick" based on this novel will be released soon. The above is a popular introduction. It is impossible for the film to capture all the plots of the book. It must be greatly compressed, with the protagonist Mr. Pickwick as the center, so that the process of roaming, exploring, and hunting for curiosities is as compact as possible.

    迭更斯和他的“匹克威克书简”
    孙大雨
    英国伟大的小说家查尔士·迭更斯1812年生于英格兰南部汉泊厦郡的兰特抛镇，他父亲是朴资茅斯海军基地军饷局的一个小职员。1814年举家搬到伦敦，三年后又迁居伦敦东南三十英里的市邑夹申姆。由于家境贫寒，他没有受过多少教育。他父亲因负债而入专关钱债犯人的马歇尔西监狱，十一岁的孩子只得进一个鞋油作场当学徒谋生。后来情况稍为好转，他就进了个私人主办的中级学校，上过不到两年的学。十五岁时他在律师事务所里当练习生，耽了一年多。觉得没有什么前途，他学会而且精通了速记术，从1830年开始，担任几家报纸的采访员，报道下议院的辩论。
    1833年他开始写作和发表人物描写，后来成书出版，题名“波士见闻录”，富于幽默和讽刺的笔触。接着，有出版商征求一部滑稽故事集，书中拟附加插图；迭更斯写成了“匹克威克书简”（注）应征，全书分二十小册按月出版，从1836年4月份起陆续问世，当时作者还只二十四岁。在这部作品里，迭更斯作为一个谐趣和讽刺作家已完全成熟；他的一举成名，使他在经济上也优裕了起来。匹克威克先生可说是十九世纪英国的吉诃德；珊姆·惠勒相当于跟班山珂·潘查，这本书则不愧为英国文学里最逗人笑的一部杰作。第一本书出版后迭更斯就结了婚。“书简”出版几期后他不再从事新闻采访，从此完全过着写作生涯，一直到去世。
    随后是“奥列佛尔”从1837至1838年在杂志上分期发表，写的是一个穷苦的孤儿在孤儿院里挨饿、受冻、被虐待的生活；他当了一阵学徒之后逃到伦敦去，落入一伙窃贼、强盗和扒手的手里，历尽颠连困苦；最后那班罪犯和害他的人都落了网，他自己则遇救而恢复了被劫夺的应得权利。“尼古拉斯·尼格尔培”从1838到1839年分月刊行，叙述一个宽洪大度、勇敢有为的青年，在万分艰难的环境里同他的守财奴叔父斗争，终于得到了胜利。1841年出版了“老古玩店”，叙述的是小耐儿和她的开古董店的祖父的遭遇；这善良的一老一少因为不胜沉重的负担，被一个凶恶的高利贷者名叫鬼尔迫所煎熬，最后援助来时已不及拯救他们，祖父孙女相继死去。
    经他的朋友美国小品文作家华盛顿·欧文的热情邀请，迭更斯于1842年作美国之游。他回国后随即出版了他的“美国漫记”两卷，其中有对于美国社会不合理现象的批评。1843至1845年间，“马丁·丘泽尔惠脱”分月出版，书中叙述一个年老厌世的富翁的孙儿马丁，因为和老人的养女发生了爱情，被老人逐出家庭；马丁带着仆人马克·戴泊莱到美国去寻找运气，结果被一个诈欺取财的开发公司所骗，主仆二人只得回归英国；同时他祖父发现了他表兄潘克司匿夫的卑鄙阴险的行径，揭发了那个伪君子，祖孙重新和好，一对情人也得到团圆。书中抨击奴役黑人的制度和讥讽美国生活方式，使他新交的一些美国朋友大为恼怒。
    从1843年的温情劝善的“圣诞欢歌”起，他每年出版一本圣诞故事，直到1848年。迭更斯曾两次到意大利和法国，旅中工作不辍，都有收获。“大卫·考柏菲尔”于1849至1850年按月刊行，描写穷苦的劳动人民的生活，好些部分是作者的掩映的自传。这本书是他自己所最心爱的作品。然后是1852到1853年的“凄怆宅院”，讽刺当时的大理院对于诉讼无限地拖延，律师们则吞尽了当事人的财产，贯串整部小说情节的角色是纯洁可爱的埃斯忒·塞茂笙，一个贵族夫人的私生女儿。“小陶丽”从1857到1858年按月陆续出版，叙述天真无邪的狱中生下来的小陶丽（她父亲是专关债务人的马歇尔西监狱的一名老犯人），当全家继承了一大笔遗产时，她爱上了他们父女俩苦难时的旧交克兰南；这时候他却已破了产，关在牢里贫病交迫，他不能接受小陶丽的爱，因为他们贫富太悬殊；最后陶丽家的财富完全破灭，克兰南被释出狱，二人乃得满足他们的爱。书中抨击得最力的是欠债要坐牢，噜里噜囌的办公厅做起事来永远推不动（官僚主义），吃人不眨眼的神学，上层社会的集体虚伪。1859年出版的“双城记”以法国大革命为背景，叙述一个医生的遭遇；他因为知道了法国一个侯爵和他兄弟强奸民女并且行凶的事实，便被囚禁在巴士底监狱里十八年，等到革命爆发，他出狱时人已发疯，被救到伦敦去总算恢复了他的理智；那侯爵的侄子（他正是那孽缘的结果）痛恨法国贵族的横暴，脱离了亲朋故旧，改了姓名到英国来，爱上了医生的女儿露西而结了婚；这年轻人为援救他的仆人被冤枉而回到巴黎，在革命的混乱中被捕而被判处死刑，经一个面貌和他一模一样的朋友和他掉换，他回到英国，那朋友则上了断头台替死。还有“伟大的希望”，自1860到1861年发表在迭更斯自己办的周刊“一年到头”上，已在英国摄制成电影，前些时候曾在我国上映，片名“孤星血泪”，故事这里不再介绍。
    从1858年起迭更斯公开朗诵他的一些作品的片段，颇受群众欢迎。1867至1868年他二次到美国。1870年春天他在紧张写作“蔼特文·德鲁特”时忽然逝世，当时他五十八岁。他的文集二十二卷，主要的作品有十四部，大都在上面作了极简略的介绍。
    迭更斯生活在英国资本主义向帝国主义过渡的时代，目击社会生活的乌烟瘴气，漆黑一团，他虽不是一个马克思主义的革命作家，但人类的正义呼声却在他作品里得以响亮地喊出。他的欢乐和喜爱诚恳而有力，浑朴天真，他的愤怒与痛恨毫不含糊，都能击中要害。他的同情总在被虐待、被侮辱、被欺凌的方面，靠剥削压迫起家的既得利益的保持者和他无缘。他不从教条出发，可是反对一切不公平不合理的现象。对于凭借权位和财势的力量来作恶，他投以极度的鄙夷，辛辣的讽刺。他在“匹克威克书简”里抨击当时的监狱情况、选举的腐败和保守党与自由党彼此间与各自内部的无聊可鄙的争吵磨擦；在“奥列佛尔”里抨击孤儿院和养老院的黑暗，以及产生那种情况的济贫法和凶恶的慈善棍子；在“尼古拉斯·尼格尔培”里抨击那班专门虐待儿童的“姚克厦郡”学老师；在“凄怆宅院”里抨击英国当时的大理院；在“小陶丽”里抨击噜里噜囌的办公厅和金钱崇拜；在“艰难时世”里抨击功利主义、曼彻斯特学派和马尔萨斯人口论，迭更斯统称之为格辣格冷哲学——他这种种讥弹抨击，为他在那乐观自满的维多利亚英国社会里赢得了激进分子的称号。虽然那班身穿燕尾服手戴麂皮手套的绅士们觉得他刺得他们很痛，认为他的作品既不歌颂中世纪，也不赞美上帝，登不得大雅之堂；可是他的奔腾浩瀚的作品还是发生了很大的实际影响，起了改善好些恶劣情况的作用，而且为广大人民所热爱，他们展卷大笑、拍案、或啜泣而不能自己。
    现在我们来较详细地介绍一下“匹克威克书简”的内容。珊谬尔·匹克威克先生是他所发起的匹克威克俱乐部的主席，俱乐部中推定他以及别的三位会员，名叫忒泼曼、斯诺特格拉士和温克尔，组成一个通信小组，把他们出外旅行和冒险的经历、对于人物性格和风尚习俗的观察，用通信的方式向俱乐部报告。这些漫游探胜、访异猎奇的书面报告汇集拢来，纂辑成书，于是那俱乐部便成了一串彼此不相关联的事件和许多经常变换的人物互相联系起来的纽带或关键。因此，小说的结构，正如作者在序文里所说，难免松懈，故事的进展，由于为出版情况所限，不可能有严密的组织。匹克威克先生和他的游侣们所遇到的有趣的经历，里边还穿插着各色人物所讲的若干故事，所以整部书更显得缤纷俐落。故事的主体有以下十一个头绪：（一）匹克威克和他的朋友们到洛乞斯透去，碰到表面还像样、实际很糟糕的坏蛋金哥儿，那家伙几乎使温克尔跟人家斗剑，亏得没有成事。（二）到亭格莱幽谷访好客的华特尔先生；坏蛋金哥儿和华特尔的妹妹私奔，华特尔和匹克威克一同去将她追了回来；匹克威克雇了珊姆·惠勒做他的仆从。（三）去到伊登斯维尔，那里正在进行国会议员的选举，匹克威克结识了一个报纸编辑博兹。（四）去到剖累·圣·蔼特孟，那里匹克威克和珊姆·惠勒上了金哥儿和他的仆人乔勃·屈老透的当。（五）追金哥儿追到叶迫斯惠区，那里匹克威克在晚上无意间闯进了一个中年妇人的卧室；于是跟那女人的情人彼得·曼格纳斯先生吵起架来；被带到保安官纳迫金斯跟前去，并且被指控为企图挑起一场斗剑；匹克威克揭露了金哥儿企图在保安官的小姐身上出花样的坏意图，因而得到释放。（六）亭格莱幽谷的圣诞庆祝场面。（七）匹克威克先生的房东太太误会了他的意思，结果闹出一场官司，巴苔尔夫人控告匹克威克胡赖婚约，判决原告胜诉，被告赔偿损失七百五十金镑。（八）到巴斯去游览，温克尔是此行的主角，首先他和那吹牛的道壶漏打交道，然后他向阿兰贝拉·亚伦求婚。（九）匹克威克先生，由于他拒绝缴付赖婚赔偿费和败诉人所负担的开庭费，被关进了拂厉忒监狱；他在狱中发现了金哥儿和乔勃·屈老透主仆，他仍然帮助了他们。（十）匹克威克的仆人珊姆·惠勒的父亲和后母的事，那后母刚死去，她临死前暴露了一个秘密；道貌岸然的艾般纳寿节制会的牧师，那个虔敬的狗屁和贪心的醉鬼史的勤斯，给老惠勒拳打脚踢了一大顿，脑袋被按在装满水的马槽里灌了一大阵冷水。（十一）两个学医的学生包勃·骚由和班杰敏·亚伦的事。全书以亚伦的妹子阿兰贝拉和温克尔的结婚结束。
    以上是“匹克威克书简”这部小说的简要内容。对于我们有些读者，这种种情节也许会显得太不相联系，故事结构过于散漫。但如果我们想起“西游记”、“镜花缘”、“堂·吉诃德”等小说，就会觉得“匹克威克书简”和它们却有相似之处。根据这部小说摄制的英国电影片“匹克威克先生外传”即将公映，现在作通俗的介绍如上。电影片不可能把全书情节都摄制出来，一定要大大地压缩，以书中的主角匹克威克先生为中心，使漫游探胜、访异猎奇的经过尽量紧凑。
