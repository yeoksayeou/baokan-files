    Thoroughly Destroy the Colonial System
    In order to further strengthen the struggle against colonialism, the Asian-African Student Conference held in Indonesia in May and June last year resolved to designate April 24, the closing date of the 1955 Asian-African Conference, as the Asian-African Student Anti-Colonialism Day. This resolution was supported by the International Union of Students, the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and youth from various countries. Subsequently, the Council of the World Federation of Democratic Youth also decided to designate this day as "World Youth Day Against Colonialism and in Support of Peaceful Coexistence." Today, the youth, students, and people from all walks of life in our country, together with the people of all countries, are solemnly commemorating this day of great significance for the first time.
    One of the most significant changes in the international situation since World War II has been the broad development of the national independence movement of the colonial and semi-colonial peoples. In Asia, in addition to our country, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, which have embarked on the socialist road, most countries such as India, Indonesia, Burma, Ceylon, Nepal, Pakistan, Laos, and Cambodia have also shaken off colonial rule and embarked on the road of independent development. In Africa, known as the "Dark Continent," the anti-colonial struggle has also made significant progress. In addition to a few originally independent countries such as Egypt, Libya, Sudan, Morocco, Tunisia, and Ghana, about 18% of the African people have gained independence. In the twelve years since the war, the colonial population in Asia and Africa has decreased from 730 million to 145 million; the colonial area has decreased from 36.7 million square kilometers to 23 million square kilometers. At the same time, in Latin American countries, the struggle to break away from foreign control and strive for national independence has also developed.
    In the past year, under the promotion and encouragement of the "Bandung Spirit," the struggle of the Asian and African people against colonialism has achieved great victories. From Algeria, Cyprus, Kenya, Uganda to Malaya, the torch of striving for independence and freedom has been ignited everywhere. The most significant development in all of this is the great victory of the Egyptian people in recovering the Suez Canal Company and opposing the armed aggression of Britain and France. This victory proved that the colonialists' policy of maintaining and restoring colonial rule by armed suppression has completely failed. This victory also proved that any oppressed nation, as long as it dares to hold high the banner of independence and freedom and fight bravely, its strength is invincible. The victory of the Egyptian people has encouraged the oppressed people in Asia and Africa to strive for independence and freedom, and further promoted the anti-colonial struggle. Under this situation, the imperialist colonial system is on the verge of collapse.
    However, in many parts of the world, the colonial system still exists, and the disasters brought about by colonial rule are still very deep. In the vast territories of Africa and the Middle East, hundreds of millions of people are still suffering from the cruel exploitation and enslavement of colonialism. In many colonial countries, racial discrimination and forced labor are still very common, and the poverty, backwardness, and low material and cultural life of the residents have reached an alarming level. In most parts of Africa, illiteracy accounts for about 90% of the residents. In Nigeria and Nyasaland, there is only one doctor for every 60,000 people. In Kenya, only 15% of children live to be fifteen years old. In the middle of the twentieth century, such phenomena still exist on the earth. Isn't this a disgrace to mankind! Therefore, further strengthening the struggle against colonialism and fundamentally destroying the colonial system has become an urgent task for all progressive mankind.
    Of course, the colonialists will not automatically withdraw from the historical stage. They are trying every means to maintain this shameful colonial system. The most dangerous enemy facing the anti-colonial struggle today is American imperialism. On the one hand, under the guise of so-called "anti-colonialism" and "economic assistance," it is trying to control those countries that have not yet become independent and those that have just gained independence. On the other hand, like the old colonial countries, it openly threatens all people who are striving for independence and freedom with force. The "Eisenhower Doctrine" promoted by the United States is a clear manifestation of this policy. Its real purpose is to suppress the national independence movement in the Middle East and Africa, and to compete with old colonial powers such as Britain and France for the sphere of influence in this region, in order to establish American colonial rule there. Similarly, in Asia, the activities of American imperialism in piecing together military blocs, openly interfering in the internal affairs of Asian independent countries, obstructing the people of India and Indonesia from liberating Goa and West Irian, and obstructing the people of our country from liberating Taiwan are also blatant manifestations of its attempt to continue to enslave the Asian people. In Latin America, American imperialism is trying to control the countries there economically and politically, and plunders a large amount of profits and resources from various countries every year. Therefore, to oppose the colonial system, one must not have any illusions about any imperialism. To achieve true national independence and freedom, one can only carry out a tenacious and resolute struggle against imperialism.
    At present, a favorable condition for the colonial and semi-colonial peoples to strive for independence is the existence of socialist countries and their sympathy and support for the national independence movement. The entire struggle process of the Egyptian people to recover the Suez Canal Company proves this point. The Soviet Union and other socialist countries, together with the peace-loving and freedom-loving people of all countries in the world, gave strong support to the Egyptian people, which greatly strengthened the anti-colonial forces and momentum.
    Therefore, as we commemorate Anti-Colonialism Day today, we have a strong conviction that as long as colonial countries, nationally independent countries, and socialist countries unite these three anti-colonial forces, no matter how frantic the imperialist forces are, they will never be able to save the death of colonialism. The day to thoroughly destroy the evil colonial system is bound to come.

### 彻底摧毁殖民制度

    彻底摧毁殖民制度
    为了进一步加强反殖民主义的斗争，去年5、6月间在印度尼西亚召开的亚非学生会议，曾决议把1955年亚非会议闭幕日——4月24日，作为亚非学生反殖民主义日。这个决议获得了国际学生联合会和世界民主青年联盟以及各国青年的支持。以后，世界民主青年联盟理事会并决定把这一天定名为
  “世界青年反对殖民主义、拥护和平共处日”。今天，我国青年、学生和各界人民跟各国人民一道，第一次隆重地纪念这个具有重大意义的日子。
    第二次世界大战以后，国际形势中所发生的巨大变化之一，就是殖民地半殖民地人民争取民族独立运动的广阔发展。在亚洲，除了我国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、越南民主共和国已经走上了社会主义道路以外，大多数国家如印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、锡兰、尼泊尔、巴基斯坦、老挝、柬埔寨等也都摆脱了殖民统治，先后走上了独立发展的道路。被称为“黑暗大陆”的非洲，反殖民主义的斗争也有重大发展，除了埃及等少数原来的独立国家以外，又有利比亚、苏丹、摩洛哥、突尼斯、加纳等约占18％的非洲人民获得了独立。在战后十二年中，亚非两洲的殖民地居民已自七亿三千万人减少到一亿四千五百万人；殖民地面积由三千六百七十万平方公里减到二千三百万平方公里。与此同时，在拉丁美洲国家中，要求摆脱外国控制，争取民族独立的斗争也有了发展。
    过去一年，在“万隆精神”的推动和鼓舞下，亚非人民反对殖民主义的斗争又获得了巨大的胜利。从阿尔及利亚、塞浦路斯、怯尼亚、乌干达直到马来亚，到处都燃起了争取独立自由的火炬。而在这一切发展中具有最重大意义的，是埃及人民收回苏伊士运河公司和反对英法武装侵略的伟大胜利。这个胜利证明了殖民主义者以武装镇压来维持和恢复殖民统治政策是彻底破产了。这个胜利也证明了，任何一个被压迫的民族，只要敢于高举独立自由的旗帜英勇斗争，它的力量就是不可战胜的。埃及人民的胜利鼓舞了亚非地区被压迫人民争取独立自由的斗志，进一步推动了反殖民主义的斗争。在这种形势下，帝国主义殖民制度正处于土崩瓦解中。
    但是，在世界的许多地区，殖民主义制度至今依然存在，殖民统治所带来的灾难还是十分深重的。在非洲和中东的广大领土上，千百万人民还受着殖民主义的残酷剥削和奴役。在许多殖民地国家里，种族歧视和强迫劳动仍然很普遍，居民的贫困、落后、物质文化生活的低下，达到了惊人的程度。在非洲大部地区，文盲占居民的90％左右。在尼日利亚和尼亚萨兰，六万人才有一个医生。在怯尼亚，只有15％的儿童活到十五周岁。到了二十世纪中叶的今天，地球上还存在着这种现象，这难道不是人类的耻辱吗！因此进一步加强反对殖民主义的斗争，从根本上摧毁殖民主义制度，已经是全体进步人类的迫切任务了。
    当然，殖民主义者是不会自动退出历史舞台的，他们正在千方百计地企图保持这种可耻的殖民制度。目前反殖民主义斗争所面对的最险恶的敌人就是美国帝国主义。它一方面在所谓“反殖民主义”和“经济援助”的幌子下，力图控制那些尚未独立和刚刚获得独立的国家，一方面也同老牌殖民国家一样，公然以武力威胁一切争取独立自由的人民。美国推行的“艾森豪威尔主义”就是这种政策的明显表现。它的真正目的，就是要压制中东和非洲的民族独立运动，同英、法等老牌殖民主义争夺这个地区的势力范围，以便在那里建立美国的殖民统治。同样，在亚洲，美帝国主义拼凑军事集团，公开干涉亚洲独立国家内政，阻挠印度、印度尼西亚人民解放果阿和西伊里安，以及阻挠我国人民解放台湾的活动，也是它企图继续奴役亚洲人民的露骨表现。而在拉丁美洲，美帝国主义力图从经济上、政治上控制那里的国家，每年从各国掠夺了大量利润和资源。因此，要反对殖民制度，就不能对任何帝国主义抱丝毫幻想，要取得民族的真正独立和自由，就只有同帝国主义进行顽强而坚决的斗争。
    目前殖民地半殖民地人民争取独立斗争的一个有利的条件，就是社会主义国家的存在和它对民族独立运动的同情和支持。埃及人民收回苏伊士运河公司的全部斗争过程就证明了这一点。苏联和其他社会主义国家同世界各国爱好和平与自由的人民在一起，给予埃及人民以强有力的支持，这大大地加强了反殖民主义的力量和声势。
    因此，当我们今天纪念反殖民主义日的时候，我们有着一种坚强的信心，这就是：只要殖民地国家，民族独立国家，再加上社会主义国家，这三种反殖民主义的力量团结起来，那么不管帝国主义势力如何疯狂，它也决不能挽救殖民主义的死亡。彻底摧毁罪恶的殖民制度的日子终究是要到来的。
