    A Problem for the Publishing Industry to Note
    Zong Baihua
    Giving more publishing opportunities to academic works and articles can encourage people's enthusiasm and confidence in research and writing.
    "Letting a hundred schools of thought contend" is creating conditions for the development of Chinese academia, which is a truth generally accepted. China's Warring States period, Greece's Athens, and the modern Renaissance were all due to the free development and publication of academic thought, which is also an established fact. There probably won't be much dispute on this issue (but we will certainly not disallow people from raising opposing opinions, and those who oppose also know that they can raise opposing opinions to the greatest extent precisely because the call for "letting a hundred schools of thought contend" and this prerequisite make it possible). Therefore, I will not elaborate on the great significance of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." I only ask people to pay attention to one issue, which is whether academic works and articles can be given more publishing opportunities. I know that many people who have been engaged in academic research all their lives often have to "hide their work in drawers" and never see the light of day, without the opportunity to be criticized (silent blows are worse than malicious criticism). There are still many such valuable works or articles in China, and people who want to refer to them cannot see them. Those who want to publish do not want to run into the publisher's snubs, which only make them feel inferior. But sometimes seeing those books that are lucky enough to be published are not much better than their own, and they feel puzzled, so they permanently lay down their pens. A person's painstaking work has no opportunity to be criticized, which is the main reason for discouragement, and this is an important reason for the academic atmosphere being silent in recent decades. In a word, the writing work of the academic community has not been encouraged at all. The more specialized the academic works are, the more impossible it is to meet the world. In this case, it may not be easy to expect the academic community to also let a hundred flowers bloom and follow the example of the drama world! I hope that we can think of more ways in this regard in order to encourage people's enthusiasm and confidence in research and writing.

    请出版界注意一个问题
    宗白华
    给学术性著作和文章更多的出版机会，才能鼓励人们研究与写作的热情和信心。
    百家争鸣是替中国学术发达制造条件，已经是一般人确信的真理。中国的战国时代，希腊的雅典，近代的文艺复兴都是由于学术思想能够自由发挥，自由发表，这也是确定的事实。关于这一问题，恐怕争执之点倒反而不多了（但我们决不会不容许人们提出反对的意见来，而反对的人也知道他所以能够尽量提出反对的意见，正是在提倡百家争鸣这个号召、这个先决条件之下才有可能）。所以对于“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的伟大意义我不再多谈。我只请人注意一个问题，这就是学术性著作及文章能否多多给予出版机会的问题。我知有许多终身从事研究学术的人，他们辛辛苦苦写的东西往往被迫“藏之抽屉”，永世不能见天日，没有机会拿出来受人批评（沉默的打击是胜过于恶意的批评的）。这一类有价值的著作或文章在中国还是不少，想参考的人无法看到。想拿出来的不愿去碰出版家的钉子，使自己徒然发生自卑感。但有时看到那些有幸运出版的书籍也并不比自己的好多少，又觉得不可解，因此永久搁笔吧。一个人的心血的作品没有受人批评的机会，这是叫人心灰意懒的主要原因，这正是近几十年来学术空气沉寂的一个重要原因。一句话说来，就是对于学术界的写作工作，丝毫没有得到鼓励。越是专门性的学术著作越无法与世人见面。在这个情况下要想学术界也能百花齐放，向戏剧界看齐，恐怕不容易吧！我希望在这方面也多想点办法，才能鼓励人们研究与写作的热情和信心。
