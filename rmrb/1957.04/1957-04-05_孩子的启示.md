Because of housing difficulties, I had to do research work in a residence far away from the institute. I lived in a communal courtyard, and my studio faced the courtyard, where twenty or thirty children were playing and crying. I couldn't concentrate on the materials, so I simply followed a friend's advice and went into the children's group to "experience life." A child of two years old was admiring a ball; I asked him, "Whose ball is this?" He said, "It's mine." I repeated his words: "Oh, it's mine." He said, "It's not yours; it's mine." I repeated his words again: "Oh, it turns out it's not yours, it's mine." He was unhappy and said loudly: "It's mine, not yours."

Feuerbach said in his "Preliminary Theses for the Reform of Philosophy": "I am an 'I' for myself, and at the same time, I am a 'you' for others." I dare to say with absolute certainty that my interlocutor has not read Feuerbach's works, but his concept of "you and I" is the same as Feuerbach's. "Experiencing life" is really beneficial, and one can learn philosophy from a child of two years old. From then on, I no longer complained about the noisy research environment.

In "Das Kapital," when discussing the simple, individual, or accidental form of value, Marx established a formula:

X quantity of commodity A = Y quantity of commodity B; or
X quantity of commodity A is worth Y quantity of commodity B.
Twenty yards of linen = one coat; or
Twenty yards of linen is worth one coat.

This formula has caused questions among many college students. When I taught "Political Economy," people often asked: "Why must linen be the relative form of value, rather than the equivalent form? Why must the coat be the equivalent form and not be used as the relative form of value?" At that time, I had not yet "experienced life," so I could only answer: You can certainly have the coat play the role of the relative form of value, and have the linen assume the equivalent form, as long as you change the formula to: "One coat = twenty yards of linen." I also babbled on about the principles of "object" and "subject" and such things. If it were now, I would directly bring out the lesson from that little two-year-old gentleman to answer.

Life teaches young children to use some correct ways of thinking, although that is limited to dealing with extremely simple things. But simplicity is the basis of complexity, and although the things and the principles of things become more and more complex, they ultimately do not eliminate the simplest principles; no matter how advanced an organism is, it does not eliminate the cell. The reason why complex theories can be roughly explained to the masses is because there are places in them that the masses can understand based on their own simple experiences. Historical materialism is certainly not "historical materialism is all about food"; however, if we talk about "the way of obtaining means of subsistence," "the way of producing material means," "social existence determines social consciousness," etc., for a long time when we are promoting historical materialism to the masses, and make the masses feel that it has nothing to do with the issue of eating, then, I think, they may not understand and accept it. However, many of us intellectuals, the more books we read, the more confused we become about principles that are extremely clear even to two-year-old children. The reason for this is well worth studying and resolving.

    孩子的启示
    弗先
    因为房子困难，只好在远离研究所的住宅里做研究工作。住的是一个杂院，工作室面临着院子，二三十个小孩在游戏和哭嚷。资料是看不下去了，索性照一个朋友的说法，走到孩子群中去“体验生活”。一个两岁多的小孩捧着一个皮球在欣赏；我就问他：“这皮球是哪个的？”他说：“是我的。”我重复他的话说：“哦，是我的。”他说：“不是你的；是我的。”我又重复他的话说：“哦，原来不是你的，是我的。”他不高兴了，高声说：“是我的，不是你的。”
    费尔巴哈在他的“哲学改革的预拟提纲”中说道：“我对于我是一个‘我’，同时对于别人就是‘你’”。敢于绝对肯定地说，我的交谈者是不会读过费尔巴哈的著作的，但他的“你，我”的概念竟与费尔巴哈一样。“体验生活”真有好处，从两岁多的小孩也可以学到哲学。从此，我不抱怨我的研究环境之扰攘了。
    “资本论”里面，讲到简单的、个别的或偶然的价值形态时，马克思立了一个公式：
    X量商品A＝Y量商品B；或
    X量商品A值Y量商品B。
    二十码麻布＝一件上衣；或
    二十码麻布值一件上衣。
    在这公式里，左项表现为相对价值形态，右项表现为等价形态。
    这个公式，在不少大学生中引起过疑问。我讲“政治经济学”时，常有人问：“为什么麻布一定是相对价值形态，而不是等价形态？为什么上衣一定是等价形态，而不可以作为相对价值形态？”我那时还没有“体验生活”，只能答复说：你一定要上衣来扮演相对价值形态的角色，而由麻布来担当等价形态，也是可以的，只要把公式改为：“一件上衣＝二十码麻布”就行了。还噜噜嗦嗦讲了一通“对象”、“主体”之类的道理。要是现在，我就会直捷了当地拿出那个两岁多的小先生的教训来答复了。
    生活教会了幼儿也能够运用一些正确的思想方法，虽然那是限于对待极简单的事物的。但简单是复杂的基础，事物和事物的道理尽管愈变愈复杂，但终究不取消最简单的道理；无论怎样高级的有机体，也不取消细胞。复杂的理论之所以也可以对群众大体讲明，就因为其中有群众根据自己的简单经验可以理解的地方存在。历史唯物主义当然不是“唯饭史观”；但是，如果我们对群众宣传历史唯物主义时，谈了半天“生活资料的谋得方式”，“物质资料的生产方式”，“社会存在决定社会意识”……等等，而使群众觉得与吃饭问题毫不发生关系，那么，我看，他们未必会理解和接受的。但是，我们许多读书人，书读得越多，结果却对连两岁多的孩子都极清楚的道理感到糊涂。这里面的原因，是很值得研究一下，而且予以解决的。
