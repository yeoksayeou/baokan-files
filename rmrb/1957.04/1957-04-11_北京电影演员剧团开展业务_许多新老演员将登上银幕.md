Xinhua News Agency, 9th: According to the person in charge of the Beijing Film Actor Troupe, the troupe's actors will participate in the filming of eight films and more than four stage plays this year. Appearing on screen this year will not only be actors familiar to audiences, but also well-known film actors who have not filmed in recent years, as well as young actors performing in front of the camera for the first time.

Of the troupe's ninety-plus film actors (including more than twenty actors studying at the Beijing Film Academy), more than sixty will, in addition to performing stage plays such as "Home" and "Sunrise" in Beijing and Tianjin this year, also be invited by film production units in Beijing, Shanghai, and Changchun to participate in the filming of new films.

Li Jingbo, known for playing villains, has already gone to the Changchun Film Studio to film "Lusheng Love Song." After this film is completed, he will return to the Beijing Film Studio to film "Red Storm." Wang Renmei, a famous film actress who has not performed on stage for more than ten years, recently played "Ruijue" in the famous play "Home," winning praise from the audience. She will go to the Changchun Film Studio in late April to participate in the filming of "Life's Education," and then return to the Beijing Film Studio to play a doctor in the film "Visiting Relatives." Li Keng, who was known as a child star twenty-four years ago, is currently filming "Shanghai Girl" at the Beijing Film Studio.

Many young actors have also stepped into the artistic garden. Lin Dongsheng, who played "Cousin Mei" in "Home," portrayed the inner world of "Cousin Mei" ravaged by feudal society quite well. Cao Yu repeatedly praised her performance after seeing it. She has now been invited by a director from the Changchun Film Studio to participate in filming for the first time.

    北京电影演员剧团开展业务
    许多新老演员将登上银幕
    新华社9日讯　据北京电影演员剧团的负责人说，这个剧团的演员今年将参加拍摄八部影片和四个以上的舞台剧。今年将登上银幕的不仅有观众熟悉的演员，有的是近年来未拍过片子的著名电影演员，而且也有第一次在摄影机前表演的青年演员。
    这个剧团的九十多个电影演员
  （包括在北京电影学院学习的二十多个演员）中，有六十多人今年除了在北京、天津演出“家”、“日出”等舞台剧以外，还分别被北京、上海、长春的电影制片单位邀请参加拍摄新影片。
    以扮演反面人物著称的李景波，现在已去长春电影制片厂拍摄“芦笙恋歌”。这部影片拍成后，他将回北京电影制片厂拍摄“红色的风暴”。十多年未演舞台剧的著名电影演员王人美，最近在名剧
  “家”里扮演“瑞珏”，赢得了观众的赞誉。她将在4月下旬去长春电影制片厂参加拍摄“生活的教育”，然后将回到北京电影制片厂扮演“探亲记”影片中的医生。二十四年前被人们称为童星的黎铿，目前正在北京电影制片厂拍摄“上海姑娘”。
    许多青年演员也踏进了艺术园地。在“家”里扮演“梅表姐”的林东升，相当好地刻划了“梅表姐”遭受封建社会摧残的内心世界，曹禺看了她的表演后曾连声称赞。现在她已被长春电影制片厂的一位导演邀请第一次参加拍摄影片。
