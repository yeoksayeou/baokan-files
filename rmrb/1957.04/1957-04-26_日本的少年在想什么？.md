What are Japanese Boys Thinking?

    (By our correspondent) Recently, war movies have become very popular in Japan. What do Japanese boys and girls think after watching them? What are their views on the residents of Sunagawa-cho opposing the military base? In an article in the January issue of the Japanese magazine "Education Review," which was a record of a middle school student symposium, there are answers to these two questions.

    Attending the symposium were three third-year middle school students (two boys and one girl) and three second-year middle school students (two boys and one girl). Regarding the first question, this is what they said:

    "My father died in the war. Therefore, although I cannot say that watching war movies reminds me of my father, I do have that feeling in my heart."

    "When I returned to my mother's hometown and saw the photos of family members who died in the war hanging there, I felt heavyhearted."

    "When I asked a friend about their father, and they replied that he had died in the war, I felt sorry and thought to myself that I shouldn't have asked."

    Regarding the recent popularity of war movies, one girl saw through the fact that it was intended to "create a psychology in people that it would be good to win if another war breaks out," and she adopted a critical attitude. A third-year boy said, "If war breaks out, it will be the end of mankind. If the United States has progressive ideas, then it should automatically launch a movement to ban the manufacture of atomic and hydrogen bombs."

    These young boys and girls were born during the war period. They have no direct experience of war, but they may have heard stories from their parents and teachers, or they may have lost relatives, and therefore they understand the harm of war.

    The Japanese people's independence movement has grown and strengthened, and the young boys and girls have direct experiences with this issue. Below are their statements regarding the residents of Sunagawa-cho opposing the expansion of the military base:

    "Oppose the United States building military bases."

    "Japanese police are fighting against Japanese people who are defending their own land. I don't know what they are thinking."

    "It's too unreasonable. ... (Japan) must achieve true independence as soon as possible and join hands with Asians."

    "I saw on television that the Americans were watching the (Japanese) police fighting with the locals with triumphant smiles on their faces. I was extremely saddened."

    "The government only cares about catering to the United States and has no independent spirit." (Attached picture)

    日本的少年在想什么？
    本报讯　最近日本很流行战争影片，日本少年男女看了以后是怎样想的？他们对砂川町居民反对军事基地的事，又有什么看法呢？在1月号日本“教育评论”杂志的一篇中学生座谈会的文章里，有对这两个问题的答案。
    出席座谈会的有中学三年级学生三人（男生二，女生一）、中学二年级学生三人（男生二、女生一）。对于第一个问题，他们是这样说的：
    “父亲是由于战争而死去的，因此，虽然不能说看了战争影片就想起了父亲，但是在内心里到底有这样的感觉。”
    “回到母亲住的乡下，看见挂着战死的家人的照片，就感到思想沉重。”
    “当我问起朋友的父亲，回答说是战死了的时候，就感到可怜，心里说不应该问呀。”
    对于最近战争影片很流行的问题，一个少女看穿了这是为要“使人们产生这样一种心理：再打起仗来，打胜了才好”，她采取了批判的态度。一个三年级的男生说：“如果发生战争就是人类的末日。如果美国是有进步的思想的，那么它自己就应该自动的开展禁止制造原子弹和氢弹的运动。”
    这些少年男女是在战争时期出生的，他们对于战争没有直接的体验，但是他们可能是听了父母讲的话和老师讲的话，或者是自己失去了亲人，因而懂得了战争的危害。
    日本人民的独立运动已经发展壮大，少年男女们对于这个问题有直接的见闻。下边是他们对于砂川町居民反对扩充军事基地问题的发言：
    “反对美国修建军事基地。”
    “日本警察和保卫自己土地的日本人搏斗，不知道他们是什么样的心情。”
    “太不讲理了。……（日本）必须早日真正的独立，和亚洲人携起手来。”
    “从电视机里看见，美国人得意的微笑着观看（日本）警察和当地人搏斗，我难过极了。”
    “政府只顾逢迎美国，没有自主的精神。”（附图片）
