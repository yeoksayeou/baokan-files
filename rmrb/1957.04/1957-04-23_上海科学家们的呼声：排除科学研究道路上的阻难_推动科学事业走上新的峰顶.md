    Shanghai Scientists' Call:
    Remove Obstacles on the Road to Scientific Research and Push Scientific Undertakings to New Heights
    (Our Shanghai dispatch of the 22nd) The question of how to correctly handle contradictions among the people has aroused great attention among Shanghai scientists. Recently, in the conference room of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, at the Shanghai Office of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and in other places, Shanghai scientists held several座谈会 (zuò tán huì, symposiums/discussion meetings) in succession, focusing their discussions on this new issue.
    At the symposium held by the Shanghai Municipal Committee, scientists raised many internal contradictions existing in scientific work and frankly criticized some work. Most of these opinions are important issues worthy of attention. In raising various contradictions, some people simply reviewed the changes and development of scientific work over the past few years. Professors Lu Yudao and Zhang Mengwen of the Biology Department of Fudan University, and Su Buqing, Vice President of Fudan University and mathematician, spoke of their feelings. Professor Lu Yudao said: The great unity of the scientific community after liberation, the great development of scientific undertakings, and the improvement of scientific research conditions and other facts moved them; as for struggles to transform nature such as harnessing the Huai River and utilizing the resources of the Yellow River, they were of course unimaginable before liberation. Professor Zhang Mengwen said that before liberation, the biology department of a school he had worked in had only a small attic for all its premises, while now a laboratory of the biology department of Fudan University is larger than the entire department in the past.
    At several symposiums, scientists mainly discussed how to implement the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" in scientific work? What obstacles on the road to scientific research need to be removed?
    First, eliminate dogmatism and crude attitudes
    Scientists believe that the first thing to eliminate is dogmatism and crude attitudes towards academic research. Many people talked about the past deviations in learning foreign science and technology. One scientist said: Pavlov is a great physiologist, but Pavlovianism is not equal to all physiology. We should undoubtedly seriously study Pavlov's theory, but we should also learn other physiological insights. However, this was not the case in the past. In the past, when discussing, we always thought first, "Does what I say conform to Pavlov's theory?" Although there was no open pressure, there was indeed an atmosphere that made you have to say it that way. This dogmatic atmosphere shackles people's thinking and is very unfavorable to the free research of science. Tan Jiazhen, Director of the Biology Department of Fudan University, said: "We know that natural science itself has no class nature, it mainly depends on who holds it. But some people insisted on putting political labels on various natural sciences, saying that Michurin's theory is proletarian biology and that Morgan's school is bourgeois biology, making everyone confused." He also said: Since the Qingdao Biology Symposium, some young people who used to believe in Michurin's theory have not spoken much, saying that the Morgan school is rising, which is also wrong. In fact, most theories have their own reasons more or less, and we cannot take an absolute attitude towards them, but should implement "Let a hundred schools of thought contend."
    What particularly angered the scientists was the crude behavior towards scientific research work. Zhu Xian, Deputy Director of the Institute of Experimental Biology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, wrote a book on the population problem in China before liberation. After liberation, a reader wrote to the bookstore, saying that the book "has toxins," and the bookstore took the book off the shelves and stopped selling it. Another of his works suffered the same fate. A professor at the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics wrote a book, which was later criticized by a comrade from Renmin University. As a result, the publishing house not only took the book back and stopped selling it, but also asked the original author to return the royalties. In the past, the criticism circle often did not reason, but used inappropriate methods of randomly labeling "hats," trying to "kill with one blow" the criticized. Zhu Xian said: "Why was the publication of scientific works dull in the past? One of the reasons is this. If you want to kill with one blow, I am not willing to die, so I will not write anything."
    Too many institutions, dispersed strength
    To carry out "Let a hundred schools of thought contend" in natural sciences, the decisive issue is for scientists to earnestly strengthen research work. Luo Zongluo, Director of the Institute of Plant Physiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Tan Jiazhen, Director of the Biology Department of Fudan University, and others, believe that the current system of the Academy of Sciences has too many institutions, and the strength is dispersed, which is not conducive to research work. Luo Zongluo said: The Academy of Sciences has developed rapidly and made great achievements in the past few years after liberation, but there is also a danger that too many institutions have been established, and the originally limited number of scientists have been pulled to do administrative responsible work. He believes that some newly created research work can be attached to relevant departments, and it is not too late to hang up the signboard after the work has made some progress. Tan Jiazhen made an analogy that the number of scientists in China is not large, just like the low houses in Beijing, but the organization is like Beijing's wide Chang'an Avenue, the two are very mismatched.
    International academic exchanges should be greatly developed
    In order to develop science, international academic exchanges must be greatly developed and strengthened in the future. Scientists criticized the relevant departments of the Academy of Sciences leading international academic exchanges for their bureaucratic style, and the papers and journals sent abroad for exchanges were often backlogged. Some translated books published by the Science Press are priced too high. The International Bookstore imports too few scientific and technical books published by capitalist countries. A related issue is the issue of sending students abroad. This is an international academic exchange issue, and also a training issue for young scientific workers. Wang You, Deputy Director of the Institute of Organic Chemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, put forward two opinions: first, the past requirements for the political conditions of those sent abroad were too harsh (of course, political conditions are important), while the professional conditions were neglected, resulting in poor academic performance for some people due to their low professional level. Second, in the future, in addition to sending people to socialist countries to study, it is also appropriate to send some students to capitalist countries with developed science and technology. He also suggested that some experts from capitalist countries could be invited to come to China to give lectures in the future. He believes that as long as it is beneficial to the development of China's scientific undertakings, we must strive to learn it. This is the common view of many scientists on the issue of international academic exchanges.
    The practice of each sweeping the snow from one's own door should end
    The cooperation of the Academy of Sciences, universities, professional research institutions, factories and enterprises in scientific research is an important issue related to scientific development. Wu Shaoqing, a professor at the First Medical College, shouted loudly at a meeting: "Universities and the Academy of Sciences must cooperate closely, and the practice of each sweeping the snow from one's own door should end." His appeal came from his own experience. He studies tuberculosis, but suffers from no one to cooperate with. Once, when he was sick and hospitalized, he accidentally met a professor from the Institute of Materia Medica of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It turned out that he was also troubled by not finding a collaborator for studying tuberculosis drugs. The two were really late in meeting each other. The cooperation between scientific institutions and factories is also not good. A professor at Tongji University designed a resistance strain gauge, which is very useful in industrial production, but he cannot find a factory to undertake its production.
    Lack of scientific research equipment
    Scientists called for: Several working conditions need to be changed. One of the urgent problems at present is the supply of scientific research equipment. There are two aspects to this: one is that it can be produced domestically, but it is not well organized and is often not available. Luo Zongluo said that the greenhouse of the Institute of Plant Physiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences needed a sprayer, which was delayed for half a year and still not resolved. On the other hand, it is more troublesome to purchase equipment from abroad. The foreign trade department often purchases large items or large quantities of materials, and scientific research institutions cannot buy the scattered small pieces of equipment they need, or the prices are very expensive. Scientists suggested to the Shanghai municipal leaders to establish a scientific equipment service organization to solve this contradiction.
    The contradiction of time has not been resolved
    Reducing social activities and giving scientists more time for scientific research, this old problem was raised again this time. This is because this contradiction has not been well resolved so far, and many scientists are still locked outside the laboratory. Luo Zongluo said: "I haven't done research work for more than ten years. I used to do some when I was teaching at the university. Now it is simply impossible to study a topic. It is too dangerous to continue like this." He also said: "Scientists are citizens of the country and should participate in certain social activities, and we are also happy to participate, but it is best to have one person in one position. Scientific research must have a certain amount of time to achieve results."
    Ideological remolding should be gentle and meticulous
    Ideological remolding is a topic that scientists talked about a lot. Su Buqing, Vice President of Fudan University and mathematician, and Shen Kefei, Vice President of the PLA Military Medical College, both talked about the current new ideological situation among senior intellectuals in the spirit of self-criticism. Su Buqing believes that after ideological remolding, senior intellectuals have made progress in their thinking, but shortcomings such as arrogance and lack of unity are expressed in some new issues. Shen Kefei said: "I feel that arrogance and pride seem to be rising again among senior intellectuals, and liberalism that ignores politics is also sprouting. Some people regard themselves as 'national treasures' and ignore continued remolding." From the meeting, there is no objection to continuing ideological remolding of intellectuals in the future, but everyone believes that in the future, it should be gentle and meticulous, using the method of persuasion and education; the political study of scientists should not be overemphasized in a centralized manner. The disagreement in the symposium is the evaluation of the past ideological remolding movement. Some people believe that the past ideological remolding has no harvest, and their progress is not the result of ideological remolding, but obtained from other aspects. Some people believe that when reviewing the past ideological remolding, we should proceed from the historical conditions at that time. It has shortcomings, but the achievements are basic.
    Although there are various clashes of opinions in the symposium of Shanghai scientists, this point is roughly the same: they support the central government's policy of "letting go," and they believe that the implementation of the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" will surely push the motherland's scientific undertakings to a new peak.

### 上海科学家们的呼声：排除科学研究道路上的阻难  推动科学事业走上新的峰顶

    上海科学家们的呼声：
    排除科学研究道路上的阻难  推动科学事业走上新的峰顶
    本报上海22日电　如何正确处理人民内部矛盾问题，引起了上海市科学家们的极大注意。最近，在中共上海市委的会议室里，在中国科学院上海办事处和其它的一些地方，上海市的科学家们接连举行了几次座谈会，以这个新问题为中心进行了讨论。
    在上海市委会举行的座谈会上，科学家们提出了科学工作中存在的许多内部矛盾，直率地对一些工作进行了批评。这些意见绝大部分是很值得注意的重要问题。在提出种种矛盾的时候，有些人简单地回顾了科学工作几年来的变化和发展。复旦大学生物系教授卢于道和张孟闻，复旦大学副校长、数学家苏步青，谈到了他们的感想。卢于道教授说：解放后科学界的大团结，科学事业的大发展和科学研究条件的改善等等事实，都使他们感动；至于像治理淮河、动手利用黄河资源等改造大自然的斗争，在解放前当然更是不可想像的。张孟闻教授说，解放前，他曾经工作过的一个学校的生物系，全部场所只有一间狭小的阁楼，而现在复旦大学生物系的一个实验室，就比过去全系的地方还要大。
    科学家们在几次座谈会上，主要的是谈论了如何在科学工作中贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针？科学研究前进路途上有些什么阻难需要排除？
    首先要排除教条主义和粗暴态度
    科学家们认为首先要排除的是教条主义和对待学术研究的粗暴态度。好些人谈到了过去在学习国外科学技术方面的偏向。一位科学家说：巴甫洛夫是一位伟大的生理学家，但巴甫洛夫学说不等于全部生理学。我们无疑要认真学习巴甫洛夫的学说，但我们也应当学习其他生理学方面的见解。可是，过去却不是这样，过去在讨论的时候，总是首先想到“我的话是否符合于巴甫洛夫学说？”虽然并没有公开的压力，但确有那么一种气氛，使你非这样说不可。这种教条主义的气氛，束缚了人的思想，非常不利于科学的自由研究。复旦大学生物系主任谈家桢说：“我们知道自然科学本身并无阶级性，主要是看它掌握在谁的手里。可是有人却硬给各科自然科学戴上政治帽子，把米丘林学说说成是无产阶级生物学，把摩尔根学派说成为资产阶级生物学，弄得大家胡里胡涂。”他又说：自从青岛生物学座谈会以后，有些过去相信米丘林学的年轻人不大说话了，说是摩尔根派抬头，这也是不对的。其实，大多数学说都或多或少有它的道理，不能对它们采取绝对化的态度，而应当实行“百家争鸣”。
    科学家们特别感到激愤的是对待科学研究工作的粗暴行为。中国科学院实验生物研究所副所长朱冼，在解放前写过一本关于中国人口问题的书，解放后一个读者写信给书店，说这本书“有毒素”，书店就把书收起不卖了。他的另一本著作也遭到了同样的命运。上海财经学院一位教授写了一本书，后来受到人民大学一位同志的批评，结果出版机关不但把书收回不卖，还要原作者退回稿费。过去批评界常常不用说理，而用不恰当的乱扣“帽子”的办法，想把被批评者“一棒子打死”。朱冼说：“过去科学著作的出版为何沉闷？原因之一即在此。你要一棒子打死，我不甘心死，就不写东西。”
    机构过多，力量分散
    自然科学方面要开展“百家争鸣”，决定性的问题是要科学家们认真地来加强研究工作。科学院植物生理研究所所长罗宗洛、复旦大学生物系主任谈家桢等，都认为目前科学院系统机构设置过多，力量分散，不利于研究工作。罗宗洛说：科学院解放后几年来的发展很快，成绩很大，但也有一种危险，就是机构建立过多，把数目本来有限的科学家都拉去做行政负责工作。他认为某些初创的研究工作可以附设于有关部门，等将来工作有了头绪再挂招牌也不晚。谈家桢打了个譬喻，中国现有的科学家数量不多，好比是北京的矮房子，但组织机构却像北京宽广的长安街，两者很不相称。
    国际学术交流工作要大大发展
    为了发展科学，今后国际学术交流工作必须大大发展和加强。科学家们批评领导国际学术交流工作的科学院有关部门有官僚主义作风，送到国外交流的论文、刊物常被积压。科学出版社出版的一些翻译书售价过高。国际书店里资本主义国家出版的科学技术书籍进货太少。与此有联系的一个问题，是派遣留学生问题。这是一个国际学术交流问题，也是个培养青年科学工作者问题。科学院有机化学研究所副所长汪猷提了两点意见：第一是过去派出国去的人选政治条件要求过苛（当然政治条件是重要的），而忽略了业务条件，结果有些人因业务水平过低，而学习成绩不好。第二是今后除派人到社会主义国家学习外，也可以适当派一些留学生到科学技术发达的资本主义国家去学习。他还建议今后可邀请一些资本主义国家的专家到国内来讲学。他认为，只要是对发展我国科学事业有利的，我们都要努力去学。这是关于国际学术交流问题上好些科学家的共同看法。
    各家自扫门前雪的做法应当结束
    科学院、高等学校、专业研究机关、工厂企业在科学研究上的协作，是一个关系科学发展的重要问题。第一医学院教授吴绍青在一次会上大声疾呼：“高等学校和科学院一定要密切合作，各家自扫门前雪的做法应当结束了。”他的呼吁是从切身遭遇中感到的。他研究结核病，但苦于无人合作，有一次生病住在医院里，偶然碰到了科学院药物研究所的一位教授，原来他也正为研究结核病药而找不到合作者而苦闷着，两人真是相见恨晚。科学机关和工厂的协作情况也不好。同济大学一位教授设计了一个电阻应变仪，在工业生产中很有用处，但找不到一个工厂来承制。
    缺乏科学研究器材
    科学家们呼吁：若干工作条件需要改变。目前迫切的问题之一是科学研究器材的供应。这有两个方面：一个是在国内能生产的，但没有组织好，常得不到。罗宗洛说，科学院植物生理研究所的温室需要一个喷雾器，拖了半年仍未解决。另方面是需要到国外购买的器材，麻烦更多。对外贸易部门去采买的常是大件或大量的物资，科学研究机关需要的零星小件器材就买不到，或者价格非常贵。科学家们向上海市领导机关建议成立一个科学器材服务机构，来解决这个矛盾。
    时间的矛盾仍未解决
    减少社会活动，给科学家们以更多科学研究的时间，这个老问题这次又提出来了。这是因为这个矛盾至今仍未很好地解决，许多科学家依然被关在研究室之外。罗宗洛说：“我已十多年没作研究工作了，过去在大学教书时还做一些，现在要想研究一个题目简直不可能，长此下去太危险。”他又说：“科学家是国家的公民，应当参加一定的社会活动，我们也乐意参加，但最好一人一职，科学研究要有所成就，非要有一定的时间不可。”
    思想改造要和风细雨
    思想改造是科学家们谈得比较多的一个问题。复旦大学副校长、数学家苏步青和解放军军医学院副院长沈克非，都以自我批评的精神，谈到了高级知识分子中目前新的思想状况。苏步青认为经过思想改造，高级知识分子在思想上是有进步的，但自高自大、不够团结等缺点在一些新的问题上又有表现。沈克非说：“我觉得高级知识分子中自大和骄傲似乎又有些抬头，忽视政治的自由主义也有萌芽，有些人以‘国宝’自居，忽视了继续改造。”从会议上看，对知识分子今后要继续进行思想改造一点并无异议，但是大家认为今后应当和风细雨，运用说服教育的方法；科学家的政治学习不要过于强调集中。座谈中有分歧的是对过去思想改造运动的估价，有人认为过去的思想改造毫无收获，自己的进步不是思想改造的成绩，而是从其他方面获得的。有人认为在回顾过去的思想改造的时候，应该从当时的历史条件出发，它有缺点，但成绩是基本的。
    上海市的科学家们在座谈时尽管有种种不同意见的交锋，但这一点是大体相同的：他们拥护中央“放”的方针，他们认为“百花齐放、百家争鸣”这个方针的贯彻，必将推动祖国科学事业走向一个新的峰顶。
