Xinhua News Agency report: Former Nazi General Speidel held his inauguration ceremony in Fontainebleau (south of Paris, site of the Central European Ground Forces Headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization) on April 3. The ceremony lasted only seven minutes, with a heavy and embarrassed atmosphere. At the inauguration ceremony, the French Gendarmerie band played "Deutschland über Alles." Then, the West German Lieutenant General, who served as Chief of Staff of the German Command in France during World War II, inspected the guard of honor accompanied by his assistant, French Major General de Roussilhe-Pencalé, a victim of Nazi concentration camps.

Speidel's appointment was almost completely kept secret from the public and the press. Reporters received no information about Speidel's arrival in France.

Speidel was originally scheduled to take office on the 1st, but had to postpone the date for fear of protest demonstrations by Parisian citizens on that day.

After taking office, Speidel will command the Central European ground forces of the North Atlantic Group—the armies of West Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg, as well as the Central European troops of the United States, Britain, and Canada.

Speidel's appointment and inauguration have provoked angry protests from the French people.

Deputy Gabriel Péri, on behalf of the Communist Parliamentary Group of the National Assembly, issued a statement on Speidel's inauguration, saying: "April 3rd is a day of national shame for our country. This morning, a former fascist general received military honors in Fontainebleau, which is a disgrace."

The Communists suggested that the National Assembly meeting be adjourned to mourn the victims of the fascists. However, a majority of deputies, including Socialists, Popular Republicans, and "Independent Republicans," rejected the motion. In protest, all Communist deputies in the National Assembly shouted "Down with Speidel" and withdrew from the Assembly Hall.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Paris: More than 3,000 people held a demonstration in Paris on March 30 to protest the appointment of West German General Speidel as commander of the Central European Ground Forces of the North Atlantic Group.

The demonstrators held signs reading "Speidel, murderer," and many wore striped uniforms of prisoners from Nazi concentration camps, while some wore medals of the French Resistance.

The procession laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier under the Arc de Triomphe.

On March 24, approximately 10,000 French people from all over the country gathered for a mass rally and demonstration in Auboué, Lorraine, to protest the appointment of former Hitler general Speidel as commander of the North Atlantic Group's forces. Xinhua News Agency draft

    对法国的侮辱　对正义的嘲弄
    纳粹将领斯派达尔在枫丹白露上任
    法共议会党团发表抗议声明
    据新华社讯　前纳粹将领斯派达尔4月3日在枫丹白露（在巴黎以南，是北大西洋公约组织中欧地面部队司令部所在地）举行了就任仪式。仪式只花了七分钟，气氛沉重而狼狈。举行就职仪式时，法国宪兵军乐队奏“德意志至上”歌。然后，这位在第二次世界大战期间曾任法境德军司令部参谋长的西德中将，在他的助手——纳粹集中营里的受害者法国少将德儒西乌—彭卡腊耳陪同下，检阅了仪仗队。
    斯派达尔上任这件事几乎是对社会人士和新闻界人士完全保守秘密的。记者得不到任何有关斯派达尔到达法国的消息。
    斯派达尔原定在1日上任，但是由于害怕巴黎市民在这一天举行抗议性示威，不得不把日期推迟。
    斯派达尔就职后，将指挥中欧地区的北大西洋集团地面部队——西德、法国、荷兰、比利时、卢森堡的陆军以及美国、英国和加拿大的驻中欧军队。
    斯派达尔的任命和就职曾引起了法国人民愤怒的抗议。
    议员加布里埃—佩里就斯派达尔就职一事，代表国民议会共产党议会党团发表声明说：“4月3日是我们祖国的国耻日。这天早上，一位前法西斯将领在枫丹白露接受了军事上的荣誉，这是耻辱。”
    共产党人建议国民议会会议休会，哀悼法西斯手下牺牲者。然而包括社会党人、人民共和党人和“独立共和党人”在内的大多数议员否决了这项动议。为了表示抗议，国民议会中共产党全体议员高呼“打倒斯派达尔”的口号，退出了议会大厅。
    据新华社讯　巴黎消息：三千多人3月30日在巴黎举行示威游行，反对任命西德将军斯派达尔为北大西洋集团中欧地面部队司令。
    参加示威的人高举着“斯派达尔，谋杀犯”的标语牌，有许多人身穿纳粹集中营中囚犯的条纹制服，有的人佩带着法国抵抗军的奖章。
    游行队伍在凯旋门下的无名战士墓前献了花圈。
    据新华社柏林3日电　德意志通讯社西德库克斯港消息：西德海军军官岑克尔已经在4月1日在库克斯港正式担任北大西洋公约组织北海南部海军司令的职务。（附图片）
