Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 6th: The Central Organization of All Indonesian Trade Unions decided at a meeting held on the 5th to fully support President Sukarno in organizing an extra-parliamentary cabinet for emergency affairs.

This trade union organization called on all workers to support the Supreme Commander and to cooperate with people from all walks of life and the armed forces.

The Jakarta Action Committee for Supporting Sukarno's Plan, the Association for the Upholders of the Five Principles of Nationhood, and other organizations have also issued statements supporting President Sukarno's cabinet formation.

"Dongxing Daily" believes that the prime minister of the emergency affairs cabinet may be one of three people: the former Minister of National Planning of the cabinet, the non-partisan Juanda; the former Prime Minister of the cabinet, Sastroamidjojo; and the chairman of the National Party parliamentary group, Hadi.

"Dongxing Daily" revealed that at the meeting of party and public leaders convened by President Sukarno on the evening of the 4th, those who expressed willingness to participate in the cabinet organized by the President included Chairman Chalid of the Islamic Teachers Association and another leader of the party, the former Minister of Interior of the cabinet, Sunajo, as well as a member of the Islamic League Party, the former Minister of Information of the cabinet, Sudibjo. These three are said to be candidates for cabinet members in the upcoming cabinet.

It is said that some of the 58 party and public leaders who expressed their willingness to participate in the cabinet organized by the President will become members of the new cabinet, and the rest will be invited to participate in the National Committee, which will be led by President Sukarno.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 5th: Chairman Suwirjo of the Indonesian National Party told Antara News Agency today that his party fully supports the President's decision to establish an extra-parliamentary cabinet for emergency affairs. He said that the National Party leaders are also willing to accept any invitation that may be extended to participate in this cabinet.

Speaker of Parliament Sardono said that if it is not possible to form a joint cabinet of parliamentary parties, or if the time is delayed for too long due to the parties' inability to reach an agreement, then naturally a cabinet of affairs must be organized. He also said that although the composition and organization of this cabinet are not based on the balance of power in the parliament, it is still responsible to the parliament.

Wahab, a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Islamic Teachers Association, said that in order to solve the current national problems, the head of state's efforts to organize any kind of cabinet are "acceptable and understandable."

    全印度尼西亚工会和政界人士
    支持苏加诺组织超议会内阁
    据新华社雅加达6日电　全印度尼西亚工会中央组织在5日举行的会议上决定全力支持苏加诺总统组织超国会的非常事务内阁。
    这个工会组织号召全体工人支持最高统帅，并且同各阶层人民和武装部队保持合作。
    雅加达支持苏加诺方案行动委员会、建国五基维护者协会等组织都分别发表声明支持苏加诺总统组阁。
    “东星报”认为，非常事务内阁的总理可能是前任内阁国家计划部长、无党派人士朱安达、前任内阁总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约和国民党国会党团主席哈迪等三个人中的一个。
    “东星报”透露，4日晚上在苏加诺总统召开的党派、公众领袖会议上表示愿意参加总统组织的内阁的人，有伊斯兰教师联合会主席查利德和这个党的另一个领袖、前任内阁的内政部长苏纳约，还有伊斯兰联盟党人、前任内阁情报部长苏迪比约。这三个人据说是即将成立的内阁阁员的候选人。
    表示愿意参加总统组织的内阁的五十八位政党和公众领袖中，据说有一部分人将成为新内阁的阁员，其余一部分人将被邀参加民族委员会，这个委员会将由苏加诺总统领导。
    据新华社雅加达5日电　印度尼西亚国民党总主席苏维约今天对安塔拉通讯社记者说，他的党完全支持总统所作出的关于成立超议会的非常事务内阁的决定。他说，国民党的领袖们也愿意接受可能提出的邀请而参加这个内阁。
    国会议长沙多诺说，如果没有可能成立国会党派的联合内阁，或者由于各党派不能达成协议而时间拖延过久，那么，自然就要去组织事务内阁。他又说，虽然这种内阁的组成成分和组织方法是不以国会中的力量对比为根据的，但是它仍然是对国会负责的。
    伊斯兰教师联合会中央执行委员会委员瓦哈布说，为了解决目前的国家的问题，国家元首在组织任何性质的内阁上所作的努力，都是“可以接受和可以理解的”。
