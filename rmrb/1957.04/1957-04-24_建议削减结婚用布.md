    Suggest Reducing Cloth for Weddings
    Beijing has reduced the amount of cloth used for weddings by a quarter, in accordance with the state's new cotton cloth supply measures. This practice is correct. However, Liaoning Province has not changed its original practice - subsidizing each person with seventy chi of cloth for weddings (a total of one hundred and forty chi for two people). I suggest reducing this special cloth allocation; and I hope that, within the principle of not exceeding the limit, the parties involved can apply for the amount of cloth they need themselves.

    建议削减结婚用布
    北京市根据国家棉布新的供应办法，削减了结婚用布量的四分之一。这种作法是正确的。但是，辽宁省却没有改变原来的作法——结婚时每人补助用布七十尺（两人共一百四十尺）。我建议削减这项特殊用布；并希望在不超过限量的原则下，由当事人自己申请用布数量。
