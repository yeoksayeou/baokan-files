Xinhua News Agency, April 2nd. The Czechoslovakian men's and women's gymnastics teams concluded their visit to China and departed Beijing by plane today to return home. Before returning home, they visited their last city, Tianjin, on March 28th, where they performed for four thousand spectators.

The leader of the Czechoslovakian men's and women's gymnastics teams, Peshkova, spoke to Xinhua reporters about her impressions of the visit to China before returning home. She said that the Chinese men's and women's gymnasts, whether in terms of the difficulty of their gymnastic movements or the coordination of their entire routines, have made significant improvements compared to when they visited Prague last August and September, especially the women athletes' uneven bars and the men athletes' vault, which have reached international standards.

While in Beijing, Peshkova also watched the 1957 Seventeen City Gymnastics Individual Event Championships. She believes that those young Chinese gymnasts have broad prospects for development. She also suggested that compulsory exercises should be added to this kind of championship. She said that if only optional exercises are competed, it would be more advantageous for athletes from some large cities, because they have more opportunities to watch performances by foreign gymnasts, and the arrangement of their optional exercises would naturally be better. Peshkova also told reporters that in order to commemorate this friendly visit to China, first-class athletes Telmar and Drazdikova specifically chose to get married in Beijing on March 25th.

    捷男女体操队离北京回国
    新华社2日讯  捷克斯洛伐克男女体操队结束了在中国的访问，全体人员今天坐飞机离开北京回国。他们在回国以前，在3月28日曾经访问了最后一个城市——天津，并且在那里为四千多观众作了表演。
    捷克斯洛伐克男女体操队领队佩什科娃在回国前同新华社记者谈到这次访华的感想时说，中国男女体操选手无论从体操动作的难度和整套动作的协调性看来，都比他们去年8、9月间到布拉格访问时有了显著的提高，特别是女运动员的高低杠和男运动员的跳马等动作，已经达到了国际水平。
    佩什科娃在北京期间还观看了1957年十七城市体操单项个人锦标赛。她认为那些年轻的中国体操运动员都有着宽广的发展前途。她还建议在这种锦标赛中能增加规定动作的比赛。她说，如果只比赛自选动作，对一些大城市的运动员就比较有利，因为他们观摩外国体操选手表演的机会多，对自选动作的安排自然就比较好。佩什科娃还告诉记者，为了纪念这次来中国的友好访问，体操队中的一级运动员特尔玛尔和德拉兹迪科娃特地选择3月25日在北京结了婚。
