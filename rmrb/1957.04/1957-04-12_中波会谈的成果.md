Editorial:

    The spring this year has been late in arriving, but in this season, distinguished guests from fraternal countries have arrived one after another, and joyous news of friendship and unity has been frequently reported, bringing people infinite excitement and warmth.
    The visit to our country by the Polish government delegation headed by Chairman Cyrankiewicz has not yet concluded. The important achievements of this visit have been reflected in the Joint Statement of the Governments of China and Poland, which was signed and published yesterday. As can be seen from the statement, the content of the Sino-Polish talks was very broad. It involved the relations between China and Poland and the relations between socialist countries, and also involved major issues in the current international situation; both sides reached a consensus on these issues. After this meeting and the extensive contact between the representatives of the Polish people and various aspects of our country, we are deeply convinced that the people of China and Poland have a better understanding of each other, and the friendship and cooperation between China and Poland are closer. The Chinese people attach great importance to the fraternal friendship between China and Poland. Because this friendship is not only of equal importance to the people of China and Poland, but also an important factor in the unity of the entire socialist camp. Therefore, we are happy for the Polish government delegation to visit our country, and we are also happy for the friendship between China and Poland to be enhanced after this visit. In his speech at the reception held by Chairman Cyrankiewicz on the 9th of this month, Chairman Mao Zedong asked the Polish government delegation to bring the friendship and best wishes of the Chinese people back to the Polish people, and wished the Polish people better progress in building socialism, and wished the Soviet Union, Poland, China and other socialist countries to be more consolidated and united. These wishes of Chairman Mao Zedong fully express the deep friendship of the six hundred million Chinese people towards the Polish people.
    During the talks, the government delegations of the two countries discussed the current international situation and made correct assessments. The general trend of the international situation is towards relaxation, which is the result of the continuous efforts of all peace-loving countries and people, including the people of China and Poland. However, recent developments in the situation do not allow the people of all countries to be overly optimistic and relax their efforts. As the Joint Statement of the Governments of China and Poland points out, "Imperialist aggressive blocs have not stopped their activities to undermine peace, and often attempt to achieve their old goals under the guise of new forms." Today, whether in Europe, Asia, or other parts of the world, it is clear that imperialist blocs are carrying out activities that endanger peace, hinder international cooperation, and infringe on the independence and neutrality of many countries. In the Near and Middle East, the ruling groups of the United States are laying a new colonialist net in the name of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," attempting to replace the colonial status of Britain and France to enslave the people of the Middle East. In Europe, West German militarism is intensifying its revival, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is expanding its atomic and rocket bases. The imperialist aggressive blocs turn a deaf ear to the calls of the people of the world for disarmament, a cessation of testing, and a ban on the use of nuclear weapons. This situation seriously threatens the peace of Europe and the world. The people of China and Poland, who are committed to peaceful construction, cannot but express deep concern about this. Therefore, both sides of the talks unanimously condemned these conspiratorial activities of the imperialist aggressive blocs, firmly supported all proposals and measures aimed at safeguarding peace, advocated replacing all military blocs with a system of collective security and collective peace, and expressed great sympathy and support for the struggle of the people of Asian and African countries to strive for independence, safeguard sovereignty, restore territorial integrity, and oppose colonial imperialism. All of these, as well as other propositions on international issues elaborated in the statement, demonstrate the firm will of the people of China and Poland to work together to safeguard the cause of peace.
    The discussion and consensus reached by both sides on the relations between socialist countries and the principles of socialist construction are of great significance for further strengthening the unity of socialist countries and ensuring the smooth construction of socialism in all socialist countries. Both sides expressed satisfaction with the recent improvement and consolidation of unity and friendly relations between socialist countries, and reiterated their support for the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government and the Hungarian people who are working to overcome difficulties and consolidate the socialist system. Both sides also stated: "Both sides are determined to continue to do everything possible to further strengthen the unity of the countries of the socialist camp on the basis of Marxism-Leninism on the principles of proletarian internationalism and national equality." At a time when imperialist aggressive blocs are continuing to create new tensions and pursuing a policy of arms expansion and war preparations, and at a time when they are continuing to carry out sabotage activities against socialist countries, the strengthening of the unity of socialist countries is of even more urgent importance, because the unity of socialist countries is a reliable guarantee for world peace and the victory of the socialist cause.
    The People's Republic of China and the People's Republic of Poland, united by common ideals and goals, have achieved great success in political, economic, and cultural cooperation in the past. This visit by the Polish government delegation and the Sino-Polish talks have further strengthened the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries, and will help enhance the unity of socialist countries and safeguard the noble cause of world peace.
    The comrades of the Polish government delegation headed by Chairman of the Council of Ministers Cyrankiewicz will leave us after one or two more days of visits in our country. Although we have not been together for long, we have all left unforgettable impressions on each other. We sincerely thank the delegation for bringing the fraternal friendship of the Polish people to us, and we are also deeply convinced that the envoys of the Polish people will bring the deep friendship of the six hundred million Chinese people to the dear Polish brothers and sisters on both banks of the Vistula River.

### 中波会谈的成果

    中波会谈的成果
    今年的春天虽然姗姗来迟，但是在这个季节里，从兄弟国家远道而来的贵宾接踵而至，友好团结的喜讯频频传来，这给人们带来了无限的兴奋和温暖。
    以西伦凯维兹主席为首的波兰政府代表团来到我国访问现在尚未结束。这次访问所获得的重要成果，已经在昨天签字发表的中波两国政府联合声明中得到了反映。从声明中可以看出，中波两国会谈的内容是十分广泛的。它涉及到中波两国的关系和社会主义国家之间的关系问题，也涉及到当前国际局势中的重大问题；双方对这些问题获得了一致的意见。经过这次会谈和波兰人民的代表们同我国各方面人士的广泛接触，我们深信，中波两国人民是更加相互了解了，中波两国的友谊和合作是更加密切了。中国人民是十分重视中波两国的兄弟友谊的。因为这种友谊不仅对中波两国人民有着同样重要的意义，而且也是整个社会主义阵营团结的一个重要因素。因此，我们为波兰政府代表团来访我国而高兴，也为中波友谊经过这次访问有所增进而高兴。毛泽东主席在本月9日西伦凯维兹主席招待会上的讲话中，曾请波兰政府代表团把中国人民的友谊和最良好的祝愿带回给波兰人民，并且祝波兰人民更好地建设社会主义，祝苏联、波兰、中国和其他社会主义国家更加巩固地团结在一起。毛泽东主席的这些祝愿，充分表达了六亿中国人民对波兰人民的深情厚谊。
    在会谈中，两国政府代表团讨论了目前的国际局势，并作出了正确的估计。国际局势的总趋势是走向缓和的，这是包括中波两国人民在内的所有爱好和平的国家和人民进行不断努力的结果。但是，最近局势的发展也决不容许各国人民过分乐观和放松努力，正如中波两国政府联合声明所指出的，“帝国主义侵略集团并没有停止他们破坏和平的活动，并且往往企图在新的形式的掩盖下，达到他们旧的目的。”今天，无论在欧洲、亚洲或世界其他地方，都可以明显地看到帝国主义集团在进行危害和平、阻挠国际合作和侵犯许多国家的独立和中立的活动。在中近东，美国统治集团正以“艾森豪威尔主义”的名义布下新的殖民主义罗网，企图代替英法的殖民地位来奴役中东人民。在欧洲，西德的军国主义正在加紧复活，北大西洋集团组织正在扩大原子和火箭基地。帝国主义侵略集团对于全世界人民要求裁减军备、停止试验和禁止使用核子武器的呼声置若罔闻。这种情况严重地威胁着欧洲和全世界的和平。致力于和平建设的中波两国人民对此不能不表示深切的关怀。因此，会谈双方一致谴责帝国主义侵略集团的这些阴谋活动，坚决支持一切旨在保障和平的建议和措施，主张以集体安全和集体和平的体系代替一切军事集团，并且以极大的同情支持亚非各国人民为争取独立、维护主权、恢复领土完整和反对殖民帝国主义的斗争。所有这些，以及声明中所阐明的其他有关国际问题的主张，都表明了中波两国人民共同努力维护和平事业的坚决意志。
    会谈双方关于社会主义国家之间的关系和社会主义建设的原则问题的讨论和取得的一致见解，对进一步加强社会主义国家的团结和保证社会主义各国顺利地建设社会主义的伟大事业，具有重要的意义。双方对于最近社会主义各国之间的团结和友好关系的改进和巩固表示满意，并重申对正在为克服困难和巩固社会主义制度而努力的匈牙利工农革命政府和匈牙利人民的支持。双方同时表示：“双方决心继续尽一切力量进一步加强社会主义阵营各国在马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级国际主义和民族平等的原则的基础上的团结。”在帝国主义侵略集团正在继续制造新的紧张局势和推行扩军备战政策的情况下，在它们继续对社会主义国家进行破坏活动的情况下，社会主义国家团结的加强具有更为迫切的重要性，因为社会主义国家的团结是世界和平和社会主义事业胜利的可靠保证。
    由共同的思想和目标结合起来的中华人民共和国和波兰人民共和国，过去在政治、经济和文化合作方面已经取得了巨大的成就。这次波兰政府代表团的访问和中波两国的会谈，进一步加强了两国的友好合作关系，并有助于增进社会主义国家的团结和维护世界和平的崇高事业。
    以部长会议主席西伦凯维兹为首的波兰政府代表团的全体同志们，再在我国进行一、二天的参观访问以后就要同我们分别了。虽然我们相处不久，但是我们彼此都已留下了难忘的印象。我们衷心地感谢代表团把波兰人民的兄弟友谊带给了我们，我们也深信，波兰人民的使者将把六亿中国人民的深厚友谊带给维斯杜拉河两岸的亲爱的波兰兄弟姊妹们。
