    Hainan Short Songs

    Yulin Port

    Beside Yulin Port,
    A highway like a string,
    Goes straight to Yulin Port;
    Mountains and sea stretch endlessly,
    Mountain echoes and wave sounds intertwine.
    Speechless before the sea for a moment,
    The vastness of the ocean is boundless;
    Not even a tiny bubble,
    Shall be polluted by the enemy.
    Distant View of Sanya Port

    Standing beside Sanya Port:
    "Tianya" is before us, [Note]
    Tides surge on new sands,
    Waves beat the sky;
    The Su Dongpo of yesteryear,
    Stopped his horse by the sea,
    And wrote "Southern Wilderness," [Note]
    Looking north to the Central Plains.
    Standing beside Sanya Port:
    "Tianya" is not as it was,
    Red flags are shining,
    Warships are fluttering,
    A chorus of songs in the distance,
    Yesterday's uncivilized mists,
    Today's garden.
    Note: Song Dynasty's Su Dongpo once wrote "Tianya" and "One Pillar of the Southern Wilderness" beside Sanya Port.
    Singing of Mount Wuzhi

    Is it paradise or the human world?
    Multi-storied buildings, green trees, and blue mountains;
    I want to add a stroke,
    But depth and shading are difficult;
    Happily viewing the giant spirit's palm,
    Five fingers inserted into the clouds.

    海南短歌
    芦获
    榆林港边
    一条公路如弦，
    直达榆林港边；
    山海绵延不断，
    山响涛音交缠。
    对海一时无语，
    大洋气象万千；
    一个小小泡沫，
    不准敌人污染。
    三亚港远眺
    站在三亚港边：
    “天涯”在面前，〔注〕
    潮涌新沙，
    波浪拍天；
    当年的苏东坡，
    立马临海，
    手题“南荒”，〔注〕
    北望中原。
    站在三亚港边：
    “天涯”非从前，
    红旗闪闪，
    舰艇翩翩，
    远处一片歌声，
    昨日蛮烟，
    今日花园。
    注：宋苏东坡曾在三亚港边，题下“天涯”及“南荒一柱”六字。
    歌五指山
    仙境还是人间？
    层楼碧树青山；
    我欲增添一笔，
    深浅浓淡都难；
    欣看巨灵一掌，
    五指插入云间。
                1957.2．于海南
