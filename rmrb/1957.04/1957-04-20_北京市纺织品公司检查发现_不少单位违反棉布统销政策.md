Xinhua News Agency, April 18th: Xinhua News Agency reporter Lu Gongmin reports: The Beijing Textile Company recently conducted a comprehensive inspection of the cloth usage of over 800 sewing, department stores, cotton cloth retail stores, and some industrial production units. The inspection revealed that the phenomenon of not collecting or under-collecting cloth coupons, and accepting cloth coupons from future periods, in violation of the state's unified cotton cloth sales policy, was quite serious.

A considerable number of units, when supplying public-use cloth to government offices and enterprises, did not obtain approval from the textile company, and gave whatever amount was requested based solely on an introduction letter. The Dongsi People's Market Department Store was criticized last year for selling public-use cloth arbitrarily without collecting cloth coupons, but recently, it again sold over 140 pieces of work clothes and overcoats to the Beijing Coal Science Research Institute without requiring cloth coupons.

The City Department Store's Second Branch, Quan Ye Chang, and Qianmen Women's Clothing Store, among other units, have collected over 4,800 feet of cloth coupons from future periods and expired coupons in recent months. The Thirteenth and Fourteenth Sewing Production Cooperatives, feeling that clothing was not selling well, converted over 26,000 meters of clothing fabric supplied with coupons in January and February into non-coupon-required schoolbags and handkerchiefs for mass sales. The Twelfth Sewing Production Cooperative has sold clothing to other regions in recent months, equivalent to over 86,000 meters of cotton cloth, and has not yet recovered the cloth coupons.

In the Dongdan district, where commerce is relatively concentrated, seventy sewing and department stores collected future-period cloth coupons during supply, accounting for nearly 40% of the inspected households, with wrongly collected cloth coupons reaching 9,000 feet. The Li Ruifa Clothing Store in Chongwen District not only missed and under-collected thousands of feet of cloth coupons, but also concealed over 1,000 feet of cotton cloth, which was only revealed after inspection and persuasion.

This inspection also revealed that various systems in the cotton cloth supply work were very chaotic. Many units have been storing the cloth coupons they have recovered over the years arbitrarily, without counting or submitting them, causing confusion, with a large discrepancy between the recovered cloth coupons and the sold cotton cloth.

The负责人 of the Beijing commercial departments said that after this inspection, many facts show that many people still lack a correct understanding of the state's unified cotton cloth sales policy. In particular, there is bureaucracy in the leadership, with insufficient attention and publicity to this work, and a lack of regular inspections. At the same time, some systems also have problems, neglecting the implementation of policies. These must be rectified and resolved.

### 北京市纺织品公司检查发现  不少单位违反棉布统销政策

    北京市纺织品公司检查发现
    不少单位违反棉布统销政策
    据新华社18日讯　新华社记者卢恭敏报道：北京市纺织品公司最近对八百多户缝纫、百货、棉布经销店和部分工业生产单位全面检查了用布情况。检查中发现不收或少收布票、收下期布票等违反国家棉布统销政策的现象相当严重。
    相当多的单位在向机关、企业供应公用布的时候，都不经纺织品公司审批，只凭介绍信要多少就给多少。东四人民市场百货商店去年曾经因为不收布票随便出售公用布而受到批评，可是最近又不要布票把工作服和大衣一百四十多件出售给北京市煤炭科学研究院。
    市百货公司第二门市部、劝业场和前门妇女服装商店等三个单位，近几个月内收下的下期和过期布票就有四千八百多尺。第十三、十四两个缝纫生产合作社，感到服装不好销，就把1、2月份购进的两万六千多公尺凭票供应的服装用布，改制成非凭票供应的书包和手帕大量推销。第十二缝纫生产合作社近几个月出售给外埠的服装，折合棉布有八万六千多公尺，到现在还没有收回布票。
    在商业比较集中的东单区，有七十家缝纫、百货店在供应中都收下期布票，占被检查户数近40％，错收的布票达九千尺。崇文区李瑞发服装店不但漏收、欠收几千尺布票，还隐藏了一千多尺棉布，经过检查和说服教育，才拿出来。
    这次检查，还发现棉布供应工作中各种制度很混乱。许多单位几年来收回的布票，随便存放，既不清点，也不上缴，混淆不清，收回的布票和销出的棉布相差很多。
    北京市商业部门的负责人说，经过这次检查，许多事实说明还有不少人对国家的棉布统销政策缺乏正确的认识。特别是领导上存在着官僚主义，对这件工作重视和宣传不够，没有经常进行检查。同时，有些制度也存在着问题，忽视政策的贯彻。这些都必须加以整顿解决。
