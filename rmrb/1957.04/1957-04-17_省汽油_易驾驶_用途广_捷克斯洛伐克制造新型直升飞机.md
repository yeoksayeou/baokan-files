Saves Gasoline, Easy to Drive, Wide Range of Uses
    Czechoslovakia Manufactures New Type of Helicopter

    (Our dispatch) A new HC2 type helicopter was exhibited at the Second Czechoslovak Machine Manufacturing Exhibition recently held in Brno.

    The cabin of this helicopter is semi-open, and there are two lightweight seats inside. The entire cabin is mounted on three wheeled supports. The top of the helicopter is equipped with a three-bladed rotor for lifting. The tail is equipped with a two-bladed propeller for forward propulsion. These two propellers are powered by four Prague DH engine motors, with eighty horsepower, and can rotate three thousand revolutions per minute.

    The HC2 helicopter has many advantages. It is the most economical of its kind, saving gasoline. It only needs about 20 liters of gasoline to fly 100 kilometers. It is most suitable for beginners to drive. It is easy to control during takeoff and landing, and only a few square meters of open space is needed. It has a wide range of uses. It can be used as a short-distance transportation tool, transporting milk to mountainous areas, transporting passengers from the city to the airport, and providing medical assistance to areas with inconvenient transportation. It is also suitable for transporting small quantities of goods and parcels. (Ling)

    省汽油　易驾驶　用途广
    捷克斯洛伐克制造新型直升飞机
    本报讯　最近在布尔诺举行的第二届捷克斯洛伐克机器制造展览会上，展出了一种HC2型新式直升飞机。
    这种直升飞机的机舱是半开式的，机舱里面有两个轻便座位，整个机舱架在三个轮子的脚座上。机顶上装有升降用的三叶螺旋桨。机尾装有前进用的双叶螺旋桨，这两个螺旋桨由四个布拉格DH牌引擎的发动机开动，有八十匹马力，每分钟可转三千周。
    HC2型直升飞机有很多的优点，它是同一类飞机中最经济的一种，很省汽油，飞行一百公里只需约二十公升的汽油；它最适合初学的人驾驶，起飞和降落的时候都很容易操纵，只需要几平方公尺空地就够了；用途很广，可作短距离的交通工具，把牛奶运到山区，把乘客从城市送到机场，并能给交通不便的地区以医疗援助，还适于运输少量货物和邮包。（凌）
