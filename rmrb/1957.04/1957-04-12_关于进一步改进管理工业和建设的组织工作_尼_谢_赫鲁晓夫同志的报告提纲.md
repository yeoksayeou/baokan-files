The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the USSR, after discussing the issue of "Further Improving the Organizational Work of Managing Industry and Construction" at the February Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU, entrusted the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers of the USSR to make specific proposals on reforming the leadership of industry and construction. Considering the nationwide significance of this issue, it was decided to submit it for examination by the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.

The Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers of the USSR, in accordance with this mandate, are submitting to the forthcoming session of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR a proposal on further improving the organizational work of managing industry and construction. It was decided to appoint Comrade N.S. Khrushchev as the reporter on this issue.

The Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers of the USSR attach great importance to the improvement of the organizational work of managing industry and construction.

The Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers of the USSR have decided to publish the outline of the report in the newspapers and to conduct a nationwide discussion on this issue, in order to formulate the most rational forms of managing our national economy on the basis of a broad exchange of opinions and a comprehensive consideration of our existing experience. The reform of the management of industry and construction should follow certain directions, and the outline sets forth the basic principles of this direction. The outline does not intend to present in a complete form all the specific issues related to the new structure of central and local economic management. The nationwide discussion will be able to find the most perfect organizational forms for managing industry and construction under modern conditions.

The Central Committees of the Communist Parties of the Union Republics, the Party Regional Committees and Provincial Committees, the Councils of Ministers of the Union Republics, the Regional and Provincial Councils of Labor Deputies should, while organizing discussions on the outline, not waste time and immediately begin to work out measures for reforming the management work, and prepare specific proposals for the composition of the Councils of the National Economy. At the same time, it is necessary to carefully consider the issue of the proper placement of cadres, in order to bring highly qualified specialists and experienced production organizers to the leadership of the Councils of the National Economy and planning organs.

As a result of the reform of the management of industry and construction, a large number of people will be released from the current departments. The majority of them are highly qualified specialists—engineers, technicians, economists, and clerks. It is necessary to treat them with care, and according to the qualifications and experience of the personnel released by each department, to arrange their work. These comrades will correctly understand the measures taken by the Party and the government, and will again take up the lively work of organizers in the direct creation of material wealth. They will display greater efficiency, continue their labor activities, and work for the benefit of our socialist state.

The Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers of the USSR call upon the Party, Soviet, trade union, and Komsomol organizations to conduct discussions in enterprises, construction sites, scientific organizations, state institutions, collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and newspapers on further improving the organizational work of managing industry and construction, to ensure the active participation of the broadest masses of workers in the discussion of this issue, since it is of great importance for the successful solution of the tasks of building communism.

The XX Congress of the CPSU outlined a grand plan for the economic and cultural construction of our country. The Congress emphasized that the main task of the development of the national economy of the USSR is: on the basis of the priority development of heavy industry, continuous improvement of technology, and increase in labor productivity, to ensure the further large-scale development of all sectors of the national economy, rapid development of agricultural production, and on this basis, significantly improve the material well-being and cultural level of the Soviet people. Now the USSR has all the necessary conditions to solve the basic economic tasks of the USSR—catching up with and surpassing the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita production—in the shortest historical period through peaceful economic competition.

Now the USSR has a powerful, fully developed, and technically advanced socialist industry, has more abundant material resources than ever before, and all sectors of the national economy have skilled worker and technical cadres. At the current level of economic development of our country, further improvement of economic leadership and perfection of the management of industry and construction have special significance.

At the plenary sessions of the Central Committee of the CPSU in December 1956 and February 1957, an initial summary was made of the implementation of the decisions of the XX Congress of the Party, and specific measures were outlined for achieving new successes in socialist construction. The summary of the first year of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, 1956, showed that the USSR is moving forward with confidence, developing its national economy at a rapid pace. To further develop the national economy, as indicated by the February Plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU, it is necessary to improve the organizational forms of management work at all levels of industry and construction, including the basic link of management work—production leadership, in order to better utilize the enormous potential and possibilities of the socialist economy of the USSR.

Considering that the level of development of productive forces throughout the USSR, in the Union Republics, and in the economic regions has significantly increased, and that skilled cadres have been trained locally, the Central Committee of the Party considers it necessary to take measures to further improve the organizational forms of managing industry and construction, so that they correspond to the tasks and requirements of the national economy at the present stage of communist construction.

The February Plenum of the Central Committee of the Party entrusted the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers of the USSR to make specific proposals on reforming the leadership of industry and construction, and considering the nationwide significance of this issue, to submit it for examination by the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.

I. The Leninist Principles of Managing Economic Construction and Some Conclusions on the Development of the Soviet Economy

1. The people of the USSR and the working people of all countries are celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution this year. Forty years ago, the working class of Russia, in alliance with the laboring peasants, overthrew the rule of the capitalists and landlords, seized power into their own hands, and created the first workers' state in the world—the Soviet Socialist Republic. Factories, transportation, land, forests, all natural wealth became the property of the people. For the first time in history, the laboring people became the true masters of their own country and took on the task of organizing the national economy according to new socialist principles and managing this economy without the participation of capitalists and landlords, without exploiters. The Soviet people, in creating their own socialist state, were moving along uncharted paths and had to overcome enormous difficulties. As is known, our country under the tsarist regime was an economically backward country. The First World War and the subsequent invasion of the young Soviet Republic by the imperialist plunderers further weakened it and caused economic destruction.

Under these extremely difficult conditions, the Communist Party, led by Lenin, mobilized millions of laboring masses to defend the fruits of October and to restore the national economy. After repelling the armed attacks of the imperialists, the USSR mainly influenced the development of the world through its economic construction. Lenin said: "The struggle on a world scale has now shifted to this front. We will certainly accomplish this task, and then we will undoubtedly achieve complete victory in the international arena. Therefore, the problem of economic construction is indeed of the utmost importance to us." (Lenin, Collected Works, Vol. 32, p. 413)

2. When the Communist Party began to tackle the task of economic construction, it focused its main efforts on restoring and developing transportation, the fuel industry, metallurgy, and establishing large-scale machine-building industry, because machine-building is the foundation of the entire national economy of the state and the basis for ensuring the independence and strengthening the defense of the country. In drawing up and implementing the plans for economic construction, the Party attached primary importance to the electrification of the state. The Party was based on the fundamental principles of Marxism-Leninism, which is that only heavy industry is the material foundation of socialism, and every bit of savings must be preserved to develop large-scale machine-building and electrification.

Transforming the backward small-peasant economy into a large-scale mechanized collective agriculture is one of the most complex tasks of building socialism. Lenin's collectivization plan became the program for the Party's work on the socialist transformation of agriculture, the establishment of collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms.

From the very beginning of the Soviet power, the Communist Party paid great attention to raising the cultural level of the working masses, achieving a cultural revolution in our country, and training the intelligentsia of the people, and training qualified cadres for all sectors of the national economy.

Thus, the Communist Party already had a scientifically based program of socialist construction formulated by Lenin, which provided for the implementation of the industrialization and electrification of the country, the collectivization of agriculture according to socialist principles, the achievement of a cultural revolution, the development of the economy and culture of all nationalities within the country, and the conduct of all-people's socialist competition. This armed the Party ideologically, pointed out to the people the clear path to building a new life, and aroused the creative enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers.

3. To successfully implement the set tasks of national economic development, it was necessary to develop new forms and methods of managing the national economy that would correspond to the true democratic principles of a workers' and peasants' socialist state. In a socialist state, the correct organization of the management of the national economy is of great importance for the continuous expansion of material production, the strengthening of the economic power of the state, the increase in social labor productivity, the improvement of the well-being of the people, and the more complete utilization of the potential of the national economy. Therefore, the problem of economic construction, the problem of managing various sectors of the national economy, has always been the center of attention of the Communist Party and the Soviet government.

As early as the initial period of Soviet power, Lenin, when drafting the program of economic construction, said that the principle of democratic centralism should be the basic principle of socialist management, which makes it possible to combine the centralized leadership of the state over the economy with the maximum development of the creative initiative of the working masses directly participating in the management of production, with the initiative of local organs and the increase of their responsibility for the fulfillment of the plans of the national economy.

Lenin wrote: "Centralism, understood in its true democratic sense, is based on the possibility, for the first time in history, of the unhindered and full development of local characteristics, local initiatives, local initiative, and the diversity of means, methods, and ways to achieve the general goal."

An extremely important principle for the development of the national economy in a socialist state is planning—the management of our national economy according to a unified national plan. Lenin said: "Only construction according to a large-scale general plan and the striving for a balanced use of economic resources can be called socialist construction." (Lenin, Collected Works, Vol. 28, p. 19.)

The history of the development of the national economy of the USSR has confirmed the great vitality of Lenin's principles of managing socialist construction, which provide unlimited possibilities for the active participation of the people in the management of production.

4. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the people of the USSR have consistently implemented Lenin's plan and, in a short historical period, built socialism. Through selfless labor, in the course of several five-year plans, the people of our country created a powerful socialist industry, which made it possible to re-equip the various sectors of the national economy with modern technology and to significantly increase the defensive capabilities of the USSR. The Great Patriotic War convincingly proved how wise and far-sighted was the general line of the Party of Lenin, aimed at the industrialization of the state and the priority development of the decisive heavy industry departments.

In the post-war period, the national economy of the USSR made a big step forward and reached a new, higher level. Socialist industry and agriculture are developing on the basis of modern scientific and technological achievements. The outstanding achievements in the manufacture of modern machines and instruments, the use of electronics in the national economy, the mastery of atomic energy and its use for peaceful purposes are evidence of technological progress.

In the years of Soviet power, our country has outstripped many capitalist countries in economic development, and in the level of industrial production has taken second place in the world. By 1957, the industrial output of the USSR had increased twenty-nine times compared to the pre-revolutionary period and approximately three times compared to 1940. At the same time, the production of machine-building and metalworking products was 180 times that of 1913, and the production of electricity was approximately 100 times that of 1913. Such brilliant achievements in the development of socialist industry were achieved in the 40 years of Soviet power, and at least 18 of these years were spent on the domestic war and the Second World War, as well as on the restoration of the national economy that followed. This fact clearly proves that both before and after the war, socialist industry was developing at a high speed unprecedented in the history of capitalist development.

The USSR has created large-scale mechanized agriculture. Socialist industry has equipped agriculture with modern machinery, which performs the main agricultural work, significantly lightening the labor of male and female collective farm workers, machine-tractor stations, and state farm workers. In recent years, a series of agricultural production sectors have achieved great successes—through the cultivation of virgin and fallow lands, the sown area has been significantly expanded, and last year's grain procurement was more than ten billion poods more than in 1955. Our country has never harvested as much grain as last year. The production of technical crops has also increased, and the production of livestock products, especially milk, has also grown.

The living standards of the people have been constantly improving on the basis of the development of industry and agriculture. The superiority of the Soviet system and the correct policy of our Party have made it possible to achieve significant successes in improving the material well-being of the people. The most comprehensive indicator of the improvement of the well-being of the Soviet people is the growth of the national income of the USSR. From 1913 to 1956, the national income of our country increased twelve times per capita. No capitalist country has had such a high rate of growth. For example, the national income of the United States increased by less than one times per capita during this period, while Britain and France increased by only 60%. At the same time, the entire national income of the USSR is distributed according to the interests of the workers, while in capitalist countries more than half of the national income is appropriated by the exploiting classes.

After the cultural revolution was achieved in the USSR, it has become a country without illiteracy. In the years of Soviet power, a new, truly people's intelligentsia has been trained, and highly qualified cadres have been trained for all sectors of the national economy and cultural construction. If before the revolution, Russia had less than 200,000 specialists with higher and secondary specialized education, then now the national economy of the USSR has more than 600,000 specialists with higher and secondary specialized education. Now five thousand people are receiving various forms of education, which means that one out of every four people in the USSR is studying.

The above materials show that in the years of Soviet power, our country, under the leadership of the Communist Party, has achieved brilliant successes in its economic construction, in the work of improving the material well-being and living standards of the people. This clearly shows: after the people broke the chains of capitalism and seized power into their own hands, if they manage the economy without exploiters according to socialist principles, what kind of achievements they can create.

Under modern conditions, when the USSR is no longer the only socialist country, when the people of China and all the countries of the socialist camp are moving forward together with the USSR (a total of more than 900 million people), the builders of the new world have a boundless horizon ahead of them, and now there are all the conditions to realize the ideal of the working people—to build communism.

II. The Growth of the National Economy and the Work of Improving the Organizational Forms of Managing Industry and Construction

1. The development of the socialist economy requires the continuous improvement of the organizational forms and methods of managing industry and construction, and the continuous improvement of the methods of planning the national economy.

In the initial stage of economic construction in our country, national economic management bodies were established, such as the Supreme Council of the National Economy and local Councils of the National Economy, the State Planning Commission and local planning bodies, which later played a major role.

From the solution of the tasks of the restoration period to the implementation of the great plan of socialist industrialization, it was necessary to establish several new industrial departments in a short period, and at the same time to have new organizational forms of managing economic construction. At that time, specialized management departments were established according to the most important sectors of the national economy, and later people's commissariats, ministries, and departments were established. This form of economic leadership made it possible to concentrate the forces of the Party and the state to build the decisive heavy industry departments, to train highly qualified engineering and technical cadres and production organizers who could master new technologies and manage large-scale industrial production at the level of modern science and technology.

2. In the post-war period, the industry of our country and the entire national economy reached a higher level, and new qualitative changes occurred in the development of production, which urgently required the establishment of new industrial departments and construction departments, further specialization, and the creation of more specialized departments and departments. This is related to the development of new technologies, the tasks of technological progress, and new scientific achievements (which cause a great qualitative change in the organization of modern industrial production).

At present, the USSR has more than 200,000 state industrial enterprises and more than 100,000 construction sites, which are located in various regions of the vast country. Under these conditions, it is difficult for a ministry or a department to provide concrete and effective leadership to a large number of enterprises and construction sites. Under the current scale of production, the existing forms of managing industry and construction cannot meet the growing requirements for concrete and effective leadership of the development of the national economy, and they limit the full utilization of the potential within the socialist economic system.

The interests of further developing the national economy require improving the organizational forms of managing work in all links of industry and construction. For this, it is necessary to abandon some outdated organizational forms in the leadership of industry, in order to avoid further fragmentation of technical, economic, and administrative management, and to adopt more flexible forms of managing the national economy that can take into account the characteristics of the provinces, regions, and republics.

The question of fundamentally reforming the leadership of industry and construction is not raised because we have found any flaws in the execution of the plans for the development of the national economy. The industry of the USSR has been and is developing steadily. The data on the execution of the plans for the national economy completely prove this. The reform of the organizational forms of managing work is, first of all, to give our productive forces a broader scope for development, to more fully utilize our existing enormous potential, in order to further stimulate the creative initiative and activity of the working masses, to ensure the further development of the national economy, and to improve the material well-being of the Soviet people. The measures to reform the management of industry and construction will help to overcome many of the shortcomings in the current management of industry and construction.

3. Localism is a major shortcoming in the leadership of industry and construction, which often hinders the solution of many extremely important problems of developing the national economy. Many facts show that due to the narrow-minded localism of some economic leaders, the state has suffered significant losses, and many urgent tasks of the national economy have not been solved for a long time. Let us take the example of tractor production, an important issue. The staff of the agricultural organizations and the machine builders are well aware that wheel tractors are superior to caterpillar tractors in many respects. Some machine-tractor stations and foreign agricultural work experience tell us that caterpillar tractors should account for about 10% of the total number of tractors, and wheel tractors should account for about 90%. According to the ratio of wheel tractors to caterpillar tractors, the production of caterpillar tractors in 1957 should be reduced by tens of thousands of units, and the same number of wheel tractors should be increased. Such a replacement has the following advantages (calculated per 55-horsepower tractor): metal consumption can be reduced by 2.2 tons; the weight of the tractor per horsepower can be reduced by one-third, the consumption of non-ferrous metals can be reduced by almost 30%, the labor consumption in production can be reduced by more than 50%, which makes it possible to increase the production of tractors on the same production area. The cost of tractors will be reduced by about 20%, and the value of repairs and technical maintenance of tractors per hectare of work will be almost halved.

Thus, if caterpillar tractors are replaced with wheel tractors, then for every 100,000 units produced, the national economy can save 56,000 tons of rolled metal, 68,000 tons of gray iron, 92,500 tons of cast steel, and nearly 4,000 tons of non-ferrous metals. At the same time, the total savings from the reduction in cost will amount to 160 million rubles. This amount of money can be used to set up a production capacity of 400,000 rubber tires per year, which is enough to equip 100,000 tractors. Although such a replacement is beneficial to the national economy, due to the localism disputes between the ministries, this issue has not been resolved in a timely manner.

Important problems of the national economy are drowned in the disputes of localism, and this fact exists in other industrial and construction departments as well.

4. The attitude of localism weakens and often destroys the normal production connections between enterprises of different industrial departments within the same economic administrative region. Treating things with narrow-minded localism, it is far from being able to fully utilize all possible means to solve local economic problems, to more rationally allocate the available material, manpower, and financial resources, and to take concrete measures to eliminate the shortcomings found in the execution of the plans.

Due to the narrow-minded localism of the various ministries, the production capacity of many enterprises cannot be rationally utilized. For example, Leningrad produces 360,000 tons of cast iron and cast steel annually, but the enterprises of Leningrad can only use 250,000 tons, and the rest are shipped to other places. At the same time, Leningrad also imports 40,000 tons of large cast iron and cast steel. Due to the lack of production capacity, it is necessary to strictly limit the construction of new foundry shops. But due to the existence of serious localism tendencies, irrational construction is still being carried out. For example, in Leningrad, there is a "Leningrad Machine Tool Foundry" with an annual production capacity of about 30,000 tons of cast iron, but a second cast iron shop with an annual production capacity of 5,000 tons of cast iron was established within the Sverdlov Machine Tool Plant, and there is also a third shop with a capacity of 4,000 tons that has already been put into operation. Despite the fact that these factories are not far from each other, and that the "Leningrad Machine Tool Foundry" still has to ship out more than 8,000 tons of the same castings every year, another foundry shop is still being established there. Such practices have caused great material losses to the state.

Such shortcomings are also common in other places, and they occur because the production plans and the construction plans for new shops and factories are drawn up individually by each ministry, and they do not consider what other ministries are doing, do not consider the characteristics of the regions, and do not involve local workers in the drawing up of these plans.

5. At present, there is a lack of coordination between the construction organizations of many ministries and departments, which has brought great losses to the national economy. This makes it necessary for each construction organization in the same city or region to establish its own production base, and also to set up many auxiliary enterprises and institutions, and to establish its own automobile transport and supply warehouses. As a result, the funds allocated for the establishment of construction bases have increased significantly, while the effectiveness of the bases has decreased.

Due to this lack of coordination, the construction work in a province or city is often carried out by many construction organizations. For example, the construction work in the Chkalov region is carried out by 182 construction and installation organizations under 25 ministries and departments; the construction work in the Sverdlov region is carried out by 203 construction and installation organizations under 30 ministries and departments, and these construction and installation organizations often work with their own forces on the same street in the same district. Things have reached the point where, for example, in Sverdlovsk on Kuzbass Street, the construction of eight residential buildings was entrusted to construction organizations under seven different ministries and departments. In Belgorod, such a provincial city, there are six construction organizations under eight ministries and departments and seven specialized construction organizations, which together complete 90 million rubles of construction work.

Due to the above situation, the funds for the construction of industrial enterprises and residential buildings are scattered, the construction period is extended, the construction costs are significantly increased, the construction machinery and transport are not well utilized, and the administrative expenses of the management personnel are increased, resulting in a high cost to the state. The experience of the joint construction organizations in Moscow, Leningrad, and many other cities shows that such expanded construction organizations managed by regions can overcome the above shortcomings and significantly improve the quality indicators of construction.

6. Under the current system of managing industry and construction, each ministry often tries to prepare everything for itself, without considering the consumption of funds and materials, without considering that this will lead to the underutilization of production areas and equipment, and will cause reverse transportation, long-distance transportation, and other irrational transportation.

For example, in the machine-building industry, due to the lack of sufficient development of the specialization and cooperation of enterprises, the production of castings, forgings, and stampings is scattered in a large number of small enterprises under many ministries and departments. The proportion of specialized plants for the production of cast iron, cast steel, and stampings is still small.

Currently, production cooperation is mainly carried out within the departments, and the cooperation between the enterprises of various ministries is poor, which makes it impossible to fully utilize the production capacity. For example, the Kiev "Red Excavator" plant of the Ministry of Construction and Road Machinery Manufacturing changed and expanded the foundry shop. Currently, this plant supplies castings to the enterprises of this ministry in Tashkent, Leningrad, Sverdlovsk, Gorky, Kursk, Izhevsk, and even Tyumen and Kurgan. At the same time, other ministries transport large quantities of castings from these cities to other regions of the country. In this situation, the transportation distance of the castings reaches more than 3,500 kilometers. The transportation cost of cast iron from the Kiev "Red Excavator" plant to Tyumen accounts for more than 20% of the production value of the cast iron. If the problem is approached from a more economical point of view, the castings produced by the enterprises of other ministries can be supplied to the local construction machinery and road machinery manufacturing plants, thus avoiding reverse transportation. But the narrow localism interests of the ministries do not allow the problem to be solved rationally from the national interests. Irrational transportation of goods brings great losses to the national economy.

7. Another extremely important reason for the reform of the management of industry and construction is to more rationally utilize specialized personnel and to more widely involve a large number of local workers in the leadership of industry and construction sites.

The Party and the government, when training a large number of specialized personnel for various sectors of the national economy, paid special attention to the training of engineering and technical cadres. In 1928, we had 98,000 engineers and technicians, and now they have reached more than 1.6 million. In the years of Soviet power, our country's higher educational institutions have trained more than 3.5 million specialized personnel, of which about 1 million are engineers. The number of scientists has greatly increased. In 1913, there were only a little more than 10,000 scientists in scientific institutions and higher educational institutions, and now there are 240,000.

These data show how large a team of qualified cadres our country has. However, the current situation is that a large number of talented production organizers and engineering and technical personnel cannot directly participate in production but are left in the management bodies.

In recent years, we have done a great deal of work to overcome the shortcomings in the organizational structure and to eliminate the phenomenon of excessive personnel in the management bodies. In the past three years, the number of management personnel, procurement personnel, and other non-production personnel has been reduced by more than 900,000, and a large part of them have participated in production. However, the economic management bodies are still bloated.

The reform of the leadership of industry and construction will enable us to significantly streamline the bodies, overcome the existing shortcomings in the use of qualified cadres, and transfer the personnel released from the management bodies and service bodies to enterprises and construction sites that directly create material wealth.

8. Currently, the structure of the various industrial and construction ministries is overlapping and complex. The ministries and departments, from the central leadership, are distributed throughout the country's enterprises, which inevitably leads to the establishment of many parallel bodies—various supply offices, supply stations, and trusts, etc. In each ministry, there are many main departments, management departments, sections, and other branch bodies. The regional management departments responsible for the leadership of enterprises in Siberia, Central Asia, the Far East, and other remote regions are generally located in Moscow. The ministries are bloated, and thus, the solution of problems raised by the enterprises has to go through a long route and through many overlapping bodies. Due to the lack of coordination between the various bodies, and due to the fact that the ministries and main departments are far from the enterprises and construction sites, the ministry's personnel have to spend a lot of time writing letters, drafting and issuing orders and directives, drafting and sending reports and notifications, and cannot do a good job of practical organizational work in the factories and construction sites. The large number of documents issued by the ministries cause many of the enterprise's personnel to be detached from specific work. Many experts are away from the lively production work, called from the localities to the center, and stay in the ministries for several months.

All these shortcomings have a negative impact on the formulation and implementation of the plans of the enterprises and construction sites, making it impossible to fully utilize the existing production capacity, and scattering the funds to a large number of construction sites.

9. The composition of the ministries and departments managing industry and construction also has a negative impact on the organizational work of material and technical supply to enterprises and construction sites. Each ministry and department has its own set of large supply bodies. The supply network is both bloated and expensive. In industrial centers, there are usually many supply bodies of different ministries and departments. For example, Leningrad has 123 supply bodies, Kharkov region has 74, and Novosibirsk region has 76. Ministries often set up several parallel supply offices and agencies in the same city. For example, the Ministry of Construction of the USSR has 15 supply bodies in Moscow, 9 in Leningrad, 7 in Minsk, and 6 in Novosibirsk.

Although each ministry has a large supply body, there are often cases of untimely and incomplete supply of raw materials to enterprises and construction sites. This creates difficulties for the work of enterprises and construction sites, disrupts the rhythm of work, sometimes causes workers and equipment to stop working, and causes a large amount of materials to accumulate and freeze in some enterprises, while other enterprises feel a shortage. The ministries are far from the enterprises and cannot fully understand the needs of the enterprises, and often cannot take timely measures to meet the needs of the enterprises and construction sites.

10. To further develop the national economy of our country, the February Plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU considers it necessary to adopt such a form of leadership of economic construction that can fully combine the concrete and effective leadership of the localities with the strict observance of the principle of centralized planning throughout the country. Based on the above guidelines, the reform of the leadership of industry and construction will further strengthen the Leninist principles of democratic centralism and planning in the leadership of the national economy. Lenin repeatedly emphasized that the Soviet state and the Communist Party, in the centralized leadership of socialist construction, must widely involve local bodies in the solution of economic problems. Lenin said:

"The lack of coordination in the work of the various departments in the localities is a great evil hindering economic construction. This problem must be given great attention. ... In the localities, since they are closer to the working masses, these shortcomings are more apparent, and therefore the local bodies must, through the exchange of experience, work out a set of effective methods to fight against these shortcomings." (Lenin: "Instructions of the Council of Labor Defense to the Local Soviet Bodies," see "Economic Translation Collection" 1954, No. 4, pp. 9-10.)

III. The Management Bodies of Industry and Construction in the Republics, Regions, and Provinces

1. In accordance with the current stage of development of the national economy, in order to further improve the tasks of the national economy, it is necessary to transfer the day-to-day leadership of industry and construction to the localities, making it closer to the enterprises and construction units. For this, it is obviously necessary to change the previous organizational form of management through various specialized ministries and departments, and to adopt a new form of zonal management. For example, the Councils of the National Economy can become such a form of management. The reform in this direction will be beneficial for further implementing the Leninist principle of democratic centralism in the field of economic construction. This principle requires, under the condition of ensuring the leading role of the center, the full development of the creative initiative of the masses and local bodies.

It is known that V.I. Lenin attached great importance to the new economic management bodies—the Supreme Council of the National Economy and the local Councils of the National Economy. V.I. Lenin said in 1918: "Now, the Supreme Council of the National Economy is burdened with a difficult and at the same time most honorable task. There is no doubt that the more the fruits of the October Revolution develop, the more the transformation initiated by the October Revolution deepens, the more the basis of the victory of the socialist revolution is consolidated, the more the socialist system is strengthened, the greater the role of the Council of the National Economy will be, the more it will rise. Among all state bodies, the Council of the National Economy will be the only one to maintain its firm position, the more we approach the establishment of the socialist system, the less the need for purely administrative bodies, for bodies that are essentially only engaged in management work, the more the position of the Council of the National Economy of this type will be strengthened. After the complete destruction of the resistance of the exploiters, after the workers learn to organize socialist production, these original, narrow management bodies, the old state bodies will die out, and the Council of the National Economy of this type will necessarily grow, develop, and strengthen, encompassing the most important activities of an organized society." (See "Lenin Collection," People's Publishing House edition, Vol. 6, p. 102)

Now, the state has a powerful material and technical base, a large number of highly qualified professional cadres, the leaders of enterprises and construction units have grown up, the number of the working class has increased many times, and the cultural and technical level of the working class has improved immeasurably, the conditions for the zonal leadership of the national economy have been created.

This form of management will give great powers to the Soviet bodies, Party organizations, economic bodies, and trade union organizations of the republics, regions, and provinces, increase their sense of responsibility for the development of the economy, and attract a larger number of laboring masses to the leadership of economic construction.

2. If it is considered necessary to adopt the proposal to establish the Councils of the National Economy as regional management bodies for industry and construction in the republics, regions, and provinces, then the existence of the Union and republican ministries of industry and construction is unnecessary. Given the current conditions of the development of the national economy of the USSR, given the situation that there are skilled cadres and increased industrial production in the localities, the Councils of the National Economy of the economic administrative regions can become the most appropriate bodies for managing industry and construction.

The Councils of the National Economy should generally be established according to the existing administrative divisions, while taking into account the level of industrial development of the provinces, regions, and republics. For example, such an economic administrative region is the Sverdlov region, the Chkalov region, the Bashkir Soviet Socialist Autonomous Republic, each of which has a highly developed industry. It is completely inappropriate to establish a Council of the National Economy for the entire Ural region of this size, because if the management work is organized in this way, it will not be possible to create conditions for the concrete and effective leadership of a large number of industrial enterprises and construction units.

However, it is not necessary to establish the Councils of the National Economy in all provinces, regions, and autonomous republics, but they should be established in regions with relatively developed industry. Naturally, when deciding whether to establish a Council of the National Economy, it is necessary to concretely analyze all the conditions for the development of industry and construction in the provinces. In some cases, some provinces, although not very developed in industry, are located in remote areas and need to establish management bodies locally, so it may be reasonable to establish a Council of the National Economy there. The Yakut Soviet Socialist Autonomous Republic and the Magadan region can serve as examples of this. In other provinces with underdeveloped industry, it seems appropriate to combine the management of industry in several neighboring provinces. For example, the Leningrad Council of the National Economy can simultaneously manage the industrial enterprises of the neighboring Novgorod and Pskov provinces, and even the industrial enterprises of the Vologda province. In the Ukrainian Republic, the Lvov Council of the National Economy can manage the enterprises within the provinces of Drohobych, Stanislav, Transcarpathia, Volyn, Rivne, Ternopil, and Chernovtsy. However, this issue must be decided after careful study.

It is possible that in some Union Republics, especially in those that are not divided into provinces, one Council of the National Economy should be established. This issue also needs further discussion.

3. The Councils of the National Economy of the regions, provinces, and republics will be the basic links in the management of industry and construction, and they will directly manage the subordinate enterprises and construction units according to the tasks set by the national plan for the development of the national economy. In the matter of planning work, the Councils of the National Economy are under double leadership, that is, they are subordinate to the government of the Union Republic and the government of the USSR.

Therefore, it is necessary to amend the current method of dividing the subordination of industry. In the future, industry should be divided into Union-republican industry and local industry. Which enterprises of the republics should be included in the Union-republican industry and which should be included in the local industry still need to be further studied for each region.

The enterprises of the Union and Union-republican ministries, companies (the original word is "КОМБИНАТ", usually translated as "combined factory" or "combined enterprise", but according to the context of this article, this unit is a body under the Council of the National Economy responsible for leading enterprises and construction units, so it seems more appropriate to translate it as "company"; such as the Anshan Steel "company" in our country, which is also called "КОМБИНАТ" in Russian. —Translator), trusts, and other production associations, construction units, offices and bases of the material and technical supply system, and other units, together with a part of the republican industrial enterprises, should be transferred to the jurisdiction of the Councils of the National Economy; another part of the republican industrial enterprises should be transferred to the management of the local Soviets.

4. The Councils of the National Economy of the regions, provinces, and republics will have all the rights necessary for economic and financial activities and will be fully responsible for the fulfillment of the production plans of the subordinate enterprises and the economic results of the activities of the enterprises.

The tasks of the Councils of the National Economy will include the formulation and implementation of long-term and short-term production plans, the formulation of plans for the specialization of enterprises, production cooperation plans, plans for the supply of raw materials and semi-finished products within the economic administrative region and between other provinces and republics; the formulation and implementation of plans for material and technical supply.

5. The Councils of the National Economy should, with the active participation of local bodies, effectively solve the tasks of developing industry and construction in the province or republic according to the interests of the whole country.

The establishment of the Councils of the National Economy will make it possible to solve many major economic problems on the spot, which were previously solved only by the ministries and departments in the center.

The reorganization of the leadership of industry and construction will enable the Councils of the National Economy to establish unified construction organizations, which will replace the numerous small construction organizations under the various ministries and departments, thus accelerating the progress of construction projects, speeding up the utilization of production capacity, and making it possible to more rationally use construction machinery and reduce construction costs.

The establishment of the Councils of the National Economy will provide broad opportunities to utilize the internal potential of enterprises, to develop specialization and cooperation on a large scale within the economic administrative region and between the regions and republics.

6. The structure of the Councils of the National Economy should not be bloated and large, and their organizational structure should be determined according to the actual needs and characteristics of the provinces, regions, or republics.

Under the Councils of the National Economy, it is advisable to establish technical and economic commissions, which should include some senior experts, production innovators and advanced producers, Party organizations, Soviet bodies, economic bodies, trade union organizations, scientific research institutions, and leaders of other units. The basic tasks of the technical and economic commissions are: to study the general problems of industrial development and production cooperation within the province, region, or republic, to discuss major production and technical problems and economic problems, to discuss measures to ensure the fulfillment of plans, to increase labor productivity, to reduce product costs, and to improve product quality. The Councils of the National Economy should base their work on the participation of the working people in the management of industry and construction.

The main work of leading enterprises and construction units should be concentrated in the companies, trusts, and other economic associations organized by departments under the Councils of the National Economy. The Councils of the National Economy should maintain a small structure. According to the number of enterprises under their jurisdiction and the existing organizational forms of the departments, some small departments, such as the planning department, the material and technical supply department, the financial department, the labor department, etc., should be established within the structure of the Councils of the National Economy.

Most of the design institutions, scientific institutions, experimental institutions, and product design institutions currently under the Union and Union-republican ministries will be transferred to the management of the Councils of the National Economy.

In addition to solving the task of improving the leadership of large-scale industry and construction, the republican and local bodies should also solve the problem of improving the management of local industry.

The management of local industry can be entirely concentrated in the hands of the local Soviet bodies. Many purely local enterprises are currently under the jurisdiction of the republican and Union-republican ministries. These enterprises can be transferred to the management of the local Soviets. The concentration of the management of local industry in the hands of local bodies will enhance their role in economic leadership.

The Councils of Ministers of the Autonomous Republics, as well as the Councils of Labor Deputies of the regions and provinces, have the right to listen to the reports of the chairmen of the Councils of the National Economy of the economic administrative regions, and thus participate in the management of the development of industry and construction within the republic, province, or region, and actively influence the process of implementing the plans of the national economy. In addition, it is not appropriate to completely hand over the leadership of industry and construction to the local Councils of Labor Deputies of the regions, provinces, and autonomous republics, because the production of industry under their jurisdiction is significantly increasing, and the task of further developing agriculture is extremely important.

IV. On Further Improving the Planning Work and Reorganizing the Work of the Planning, Statistical, and Supervisory Bodies

1. The essence of socialist production relations based on the public ownership of the means of production requires the planned and centralized leadership of the national economy. The entire experience of socialist construction in our country proves that the planned and centralized leadership of the national economy, the guidance of the national economy by the Communist Party in a planned manner, is a guarantee of the continuous rise of the socialist economy. The state plan enables the Party and the government to unify the goals and pace of the economic development of our country, to most rationally utilize the economic resources of our country, and to use these resources to solve the most important tasks of the national economy. Compared with the capitalist system, compared with the antagonistic contradictions, competition, and anarchic production inherent in capitalism, one of the fundamental advantages of the socialist system is the planned management of the national economy.

V.I. Lenin considered the development of the national economy according to a unified national plan to be of primary importance, and he emphasized the great role of the State Planning Commission in the implementation of this task. Lenin wrote at the end of 1922:

"The State Planning Commission, although as a whole, as a sum of specialists, technical and scientific representatives, has the most materials for correctly judging things, is slightly separated from our legislative bodies.

However, we have always considered that the State Planning Commission should provide the state with materials that have been critically analyzed, while the state bodies should decide on state affairs. In the present complex situation of state affairs, it is often necessary to solve many intricate problems, in which the problems that need to be examined by the State Planning Commission and those that do not need to be examined by it are intertwined, and some aspects that need to be examined by the State Planning Commission are intertwined with those that do not need to be solved by it, so I think that at present, steps should be taken to expand the powers of the State Planning Commission." (See "Collection of Criticism of the Stalin Problem," Volume 2, People's Publishing House 1956, p. 336.)

Under the current scale of the national economy, the role of the State Planning Commission and local planning bodies has become even greater. In the early years of the establishment of Soviet power, most of the scientists working in the State Planning Commission had bourgeois views and bourgeois prejudices, and even then, Lenin talked about the need to enhance the role of the State Planning Commission, and now, the cadres of the State Planning Commission and planning bodies are experts who have grown up under Soviet power, who have accumulated rich experience in planning work and leading the socialist economy, so it is even more necessary to further enhance the role of the State Planning Commission in economic construction. The situation has changed, and there are cadres with profound scientific and technical knowledge and rich practical experience, so there are very favorable conditions to implement the instructions of V.I. Lenin, that is, to further expand the powers of the State Planning Commission in the formulation of national economic plans and the coordination of actions to implement national economic plans. Therefore, there is no need to establish new central economic leadership bodies to replace the ministries that are about to be abolished.

Some comrades suggest establishing specialized economic bodies such as the commissions under the Council of Ministers of the USSR to lead the main departments of heavy industry. This means that some industrial departments will still be managed by the center.

These proposals are essentially the retention of the old forms of management in new names and in worse forms. If the form of centralized management of industry and construction by departments is to be retained, then it is inevitable that the serious shortcomings inherent in the current management bodies will be retained.

The central bodies that are proposed to be established will inevitably establish a set of bodies similar to the current ministries and main departments, otherwise, they will not be able to perform the management functions assigned to them. Like the existing ministries, these bodies will repeat the work of the State Planning Commission with the relevant departments, they will waste a lot of energy and time, and occupy a large number of qualified personnel to communicate and discuss various issues with the State Planning Commission.

The comrades who make these proposals may be concerned that various practical problems will arise in the implementation of the annual plans and five-year plans, and that these problems should be solved by a body. Such problems that are not considered in the process of planning will inevitably arise. However, these problems can only be appropriately handled by the State Planning Commission, because without the participation of the State Planning Commission, any other parallel body will not be able to solve these problems. These problems cannot be handled directly without the State Planning Commission and the Councils of the National Economy.

Title: On the Reform of the Management of Industry and Construction

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 29th.

It is proposed to reorganize the management of industry and construction, requiring fundamental improvements in the work of the State Planning Commission, making it rely on the national economic commissions of economic administrative regions and the state planning commissions of union republics, unifying and coordinating their work, and promptly submitting major issues to the Soviet of Ministers of the USSR and the Central Committee of the CPSU for review.

This reorganization requires the strengthening of the State Planning Commission of the USSR, the state planning commissions of union republics, and local planning agencies with personnel who are proficient in production economics and production technology, and have practical experience in industry and construction.

2. The State Planning Commission of the USSR should become a scientific planning body for the national economy. It should, on the basis of studying the needs of the national economy and considering the achievements of science and technology, propose the development of various sectors of the national economy, with meticulous consideration of the comprehensive development of the economy and the more rational use of resources nationwide. The responsibility of the State Planning Commission for the implementation of its plans must be strengthened.

In addition to the five-year plans, the State Planning Commission should also formulate long-term plans. Based on these plans, the correct proportional relationships between the various sectors of the national economy and the development directions of economic regions should be determined. Lenin once pointed out: "... it is impossible to work without a plan, without a long-term plan aimed at achieving significant results" ("Lenin Collected Works," Vol. 31, p. 479).

The State Planning Commission should not interfere with the administrative management of economic administrative regions. Its responsibility is to study major issues in the development of regions, determine the direction and pace of development of the national economy through planning, and establish the necessary proportions for the development of various sectors of the national economy in union republics and economic administrative regions.

This planning reform method will enable the State Planning Commission to better reflect the tasks of building communism, further consolidating our socialist state, developing our economy and culture, and continuously improving the welfare of the people in its plans. In the plans, it is necessary to, based on the principles of rational specialization and development prospects of each region, stipulate: the correct and rational allocation of productive forces, the implementation of industrial specialization, the establishment of reasonable economic ties between regions, and the comprehensive development of the economy of each economic region.

The State Planning Commission of the USSR should formulate and submit to the government for approval plans for the establishment of state material reserves and grain reserves.

3. The State Planning Commission of the USSR must thoroughly improve the work of compiling national economic development plans. Planning work must determine the main planning indicators for the next year during the current year and outline the basic contours of the next five-year plan within the current five-year plan period. These planning indicators should be compiled for each union republic and each economic administrative region. In addition to compiling long-term national economic plans, the State Planning Commission of the USSR should also formulate annual plans.

In addition, the State Planning Commission of the USSR should undertake some functions currently performed by various ministries, that is, to ensure the implementation of a unified and centralized policy in the development of important industrial sectors. These functions include, first of all, the rational allocation of enterprises, the correct guidance of industrial technological development, and the supervision of the improvement of economic indicators of industrial work. At the same time, it seems necessary to grant the State Planning Commission of the USSR certain powers to effectively handle issues related to the coordination of the work of national economic commissions in implementing the national economic plan.

The State Planning Commission should, based on the plans formulated by the national economic commissions and the republic state planning commissions, engage in comprehensive planning work. Whether long-term or short-term plans, they should be compiled based on the consideration of all possible factors in each economic administrative region. In formulating comprehensive plans, the State Planning Commission should study and consider: how correct the local plans that have been formulated are, what effects these plans will produce in the region, and to what extent they conform to the interests of developing the national economy nationwide, to avoid imbalances and ensure the balanced development of various sectors of the national economy, and to make the economic development plans of economic administrative regions interlink.

In analyzing the plans of economic administrative regions submitted by various regions, the State Planning Commission should eliminate the phenomena of isolationism and localism, to prevent the interests of one region from conflicting with the national interests.

In studying the plans of economic administrative regions submitted by various regions, the State Planning Commission should, based on the interests of developing the national economy, correctly allocating productive forces, maintaining the proportional relationships in the development of various industrial sectors, implementing large-scale specialization and cooperation, implementing comprehensive mechanization and automation of production, and adopting the latest scientific and technological achievements, revise the plans of national economic commissions.

Since it is proposed to reorganize the management of the national economy of the USSR, the main planning work in daily and long-term planning will be concentrated in economic administrative regions, and the State Planning Commission will concentrate on the comprehensive planning of the national economy of the USSR and will be authorized to unify the activities of national economic commissions in the implementation of plans. Therefore, the national economic commissions are no longer suitable to exist and should be dissolved.

The State Planning Commission of the USSR is also responsible for formulating the plan for the supply of materials and technology for the national economy and handling daily issues in the implementation of this plan. It seems that the responsibilities of the State Planning Commission should also include the work of formulating, based on the production plan and the plan for the supply of materials and technology, the inter-regional supply plan for raw materials, fuels, electricity, equipment, and consumer goods. At the same time, in the supply work of the national economy, it is necessary to ensure that the main part of the products not included in the national economic plan is directly distributed by the national economic commissions. It seems that only those products that are truly in extremely short supply and in limited quantities should be centrally distributed. In the initial stage, when there are no solid economic ties between enterprises and between economic regions, the State Planning Commission may, under new conditions, formulate the supply plans for certain products that are not included in the national economic plan but have significant national economic significance. The State Planning Commission must also supervise the strict observance of state discipline in the mutual supply of industrial products between economic regions.

4. Due to the reorganization of the management of industry and the enhancement of the role of the State Planning Commission of the USSR in the leadership of the national economic plan, it is necessary to change the structure of the State Planning Commission. It seems that a Long-term Planning Department should be established within the State Planning Commission of the USSR, and specialized departments should be established according to the sectors of the national economy, with corresponding sections within the departments. The departments of the State Planning Commission should have engineers and economic experts who are proficient in production technology and production experience, who not only do planning work but also frequently go to enterprises and construction units to arrange the implementation of plans on the spot. These experts should study new things in technology and economics and promote them to production. The departments led by capable organizers and experts within the State Planning Commission, in addition to handling various problems in planning work, will also supervise the implementation of plans. The leaders of the main departments of the State Planning Commission of the USSR, in terms of their qualifications and experience, should be at the level of current ministers.

It seems that a council should be established within the State Planning Commission of the USSR. The members of the council, in addition to the chairman, vice-chairmen, and leaders of the main departments of the State Planning Commission, should also include some experts. Major issues related to the development of the national economy and its various sectors should be studied at the council of the State Planning Commission. Issues that require government decisions should be submitted by the State Planning Commission to the Council of Ministers of the USSR for approval.

Due to the establishment of national economic commissions and the transfer of union-owned enterprises to union-republic enterprises, the role of the state planning commissions of the republics, especially the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, will be greatly enhanced. The planning work issues and coordination issues of the national economic commissions should first be solved by the state planning commissions of the republics, which requires a fundamental reorganization of the work of these state planning commissions, strengthening them with experienced leaders and skilled experts.

The main work of compiling plans should be transferred to the localities, that is, the economic administrative regions. The work of compiling plans should start from enterprises, relevant economic associations, national economic commissions, republic state planning commissions, and then be carried out in the State Planning Commission of the USSR.

The State Planning Commission of the USSR and the state planning commissions of the republics must ensure that the plans of economic administrative regions can guarantee the development of those industrial sectors with the most favorable conditions in the region. Special attention should be paid to the development of economic ties between the industries under the jurisdiction of national economic commissions. An important task of the State Planning Commission will be to analyze these ties, help develop the most rational economic ties, and actively intervene if there are irrational ties.

5. It is necessary to discuss the issue of establishing an Engineering and Technical Committee under the Council of Ministers of the USSR to replace the current State Technical Committee.

The Engineering and Technical Committee should ensure: the study of domestic and foreign advanced technologies in various sectors, the publication and distribution of relevant books and periodicals to enterprises and scientific research institutions to help them work on the basis of the latest scientific and technological achievements.

The Engineering and Technical Committee should supervise the adoption of the latest scientific and technological achievements in the national economy, assist the State Planning Commission and national economic commissions in determining the scientific and technological level that the development plans of various sectors of the national economy must reach, and consider the latest achievements of science and technology.

To promote technological progress, measures for the adoption of new technologies should be stipulated in the state plan for the development of the national economy, so as to continuously improve and enhance social production on the basis of new technologies.

In all its work, the Engineering and Technical Committee must rely on outstanding engineers, scientists, and production innovators. To quickly master and adopt important technological achievements in production, the Engineering and Technical Committee should attract those who have made valuable technical suggestions, discoveries, or inventions, production innovators, senior engineers, scientific workers, and workers to participate in the work of the committee, create all necessary conditions for them, so that these suggestions and inventions can be widely promoted to production, and material rewards should be given to those who make these suggestions. It is necessary to constantly work to discover such innovators, invite them to cooperate with the committee, so that the best discoveries, inventions, and rationalization proposals can be promoted to the relevant production sectors with the direct participation of inventors and proposers of rationalization. The composition of the committee's staff will be constantly renewed by attracting the constantly emerging production rationalizers and inventors.

6. Given that there are many common issues in domestic construction and design that need to be addressed, it seems that the existing State Construction Committee under the Council of Ministers of the USSR should be retained.

The State Construction Committee should be responsible for unifying the scientific research and experimental work in the fields of construction and standard design, conducting technical information work, promoting advanced experiences in domestic and foreign construction industries, and publishing technical books in the fields of construction and construction art. The responsibilities of the State Construction Committee will include: formulating and approving certain general standards and technical regulations for construction and design, technical regulations for the acceptance of construction and installation engineering and specialized engineering construction, various construction standards, construction and installation engineering cost quotas, and unified quotas for worker productivity. The State Construction Committee should assist the State Planning Commission and national economic commissions in formulating major technical measures for the further development of the construction industry and the reduction of engineering costs based on the latest achievements of construction science and technology.

The State Construction Committee should, according to the tasks assigned by the government, conduct technical examinations of the design and construction budgets of large enterprises and large buildings, and conduct key inspections of the quality of the design and budgets of large engineering projects.

7. Without a unified and centralized system of accounting and statistics for the national economy, it is impossible to smoothly solve the tasks of building communism, because strict national accounting and supervision of the production and distribution of products are one of the most important conditions for the correct management of the national economy.

Concentrated accounting and statistical work for the national economy is to concentrate all the work of collecting and compiling statistical data in the agencies of the Central Statistical Bureau. It is necessary to further strengthen the entire state statistical system from the district, province to the center. This should be achieved by eliminating parallel links in accounting and statistical work.

The agencies of the Central Statistical Bureau should not only collect, compile, and analyze data that reflect the work results of national economic commissions and economic associations, but also data that reflect unused potential and reveal the facts of poor completion of the tasks set by the unified national economic plan. When organizing accounting and statistics, it is necessary to ensure that industrial enterprises and construction units report statistical tables only to the agencies of the Central Statistical Bureau of the USSR, with the number of indicators reduced as much as possible. In the future, in other sectors of the national economy, especially in agriculture, commerce, health care, etc., it is also necessary to implement the measures of concentrated accounting and statistical work.

Concentrated accounting and statistics can only be smoothly implemented on the basis of the extensive mechanization of accounting and statistical work. It is necessary to establish machine calculation stations throughout the system of the Central Statistical Bureau, equipped with modern high-efficiency computers and the latest communication equipment.

In implementing the measures of concentrated accounting and statistics, it is necessary to greatly simplify and reduce the current accounting data and statistical tables. The original accounting data of enterprises and construction units should also be reduced, eliminate the cumbersome phenomena in this regard, and maximize the mechanization of original accounting.

8. The reorganization of the management of industry and construction will significantly improve the use of national material and financial resources, increase the profits of enterprises, increase internal economic accumulation, and more quickly eliminate the current non-productive expenditures and losses, thereby making the most of industrial potential.

National economic commissions should be fully responsible for the financial activities of various specialized economic associations, trusts, companies, and management bureaus under their jurisdiction, and through these agencies, be fully responsible for the financial activities of enterprises and construction units. National economic commissions should be responsible for financial planning work, allocate financial resources, redistribute profits and working capital, and establish necessary financial reserves. National economic commissions should take necessary measures to ensure the increase in profits of specialized economic associations, ensure that they complete and overfulfill the accumulation plans. Economic associations should enjoy the economic accounting rights currently enjoyed by the general management bureaus of various ministries. It is necessary to seriously strengthen the economic accounting system, expand the powers of the leaders of enterprises and economic agencies. In addition to production and labor productivity, profits and the use of production funds should also be stipulated as the main indicators for planning and assessing the activities of enterprises and construction units.

Under new conditions, it is necessary to, based on the unified financial system of the state, enhance the role of financial agencies in mobilizing funds and ensuring the allocation of funds for the tasks stipulated in the national economic plan. It is also necessary to enhance the responsibility of enterprises and economic agencies for the completion of their own financial plans. Measures should be taken to ensure that most of the enterprises' own working capital, basic construction funds, personnel training funds, and other funds are solved through enterprise profits.

To ensure the timely and full remittance of turnover tax to the budget, it is generally necessary to directly levy turnover tax on enterprises, rather than collecting it from sales agencies as is currently done. At the same time, it is necessary to stipulate the method of direct settlement based on the profits remitted to the budget.

It is necessary to enhance the role of the State Bank and the long-term investment bank, and strengthen their ties with national economic commissions and enterprises.

Given that correct proportional relationships must be maintained in the distribution of national income and in the balance of money income and expenditure of residents, the adjustment of wages, prices of agricultural raw materials, and retail prices should be carried out uniformly.

The implementation of the divisional management of industry and construction should not result in a reduction in the accumulation of funds, so as not to lose an important source for the further development of the national economy. Socialist accumulation should be distributed based on national interests and first used for the major aspects of the national economy. At the same time, it should be noted that in many cases, accumulation may be formed in some republics, but the state needs to develop the economy in other republics. In this matter, if the leadership is relaxed, funds may be dispersed and not used for expanding reproduction, but for other needs, for which the state can temporarily allocate accumulation only to a certain extent. The budget allocations for industry and construction should be made based on the tasks stipulated in the state plan and their completion.

9. Under the new management of industry and construction, the work of material and technical supply for the national economy should be realized under the condition of retaining centralized planning allocation of materials, while at the same time, the centralized planning allocation of materials in various regions should be combined with granting the national economic commissions complete independence in using the allocated materials and local raw materials to develop industrial production and construction.

It is necessary to combine the functions of supply and sales into one, and establish large-scale inter-departmental specialized supply and sales bases on the basis of existing small supply offices belonging to national economic commissions.

National economic commissions can, through these specialized bases, carry out the entire supply work for enterprises in economic administrative regions and the sale of products within and outside the region.

Inter-departmental bases can more specifically study the needs of enterprises for raw materials, conduct investigations on the units that need them, understand whether they properly store and use materials, whether they comply with consumption quotas, and discover excess materials and products beyond the quota.

During the reorganization of industrial management work, it seems that the existing product supply and sales connections between provinces should be retained to avoid interruptions in the supply of raw materials needed by industrial enterprises and construction units.

Before the establishment of new fixed connections between supply enterprises and consuming enterprises, and before the new supply and sales agencies that ensure the implementation of supply functions within economic administrative regions are consolidated, it seems that many agencies currently engaged in product sales work should be temporarily retained.

In improving material and technical supply, the main thing is to develop direct contractual ties between consuming enterprises and supply enterprises, which is the most rational and economically advantageous form of material supply and product sales. Material supply contracts should strictly stipulate the property responsibility for the fulfillment of supply conditions within the specified dates, quantities, and quality of products. Enterprises should pay more attention to issuing samples of products produced by their enterprises. This will help improve the ties between enterprises, enabling them to understand the catalog of produced products and choose what they need for production.

The development of direct ties between supply enterprises and consuming enterprises will make it possible to eliminate the serious shortcomings existing in the organization of supply and sales work through centralized management and sales agencies. With this method, enterprises will not need to submit applications to many agencies in the center engaged in supply and sales work.

To ensure that industrial enterprises and construction units work uninterruptedly and rhythmically, it is necessary to establish necessary reserves of raw materials, metals, fuels, various materials, and products, and universally organize specialized sales warehouses to freely sell certain materials and products to enterprises and construction units.

10. Due to the fact that the leadership of industry and construction will be carried out by local authorities, economic administrative regions may have tendencies of isolationism and attempts to build the economy within the region in a closed manner. These tendencies may be manifested as: striving to develop one's own raw material base based on local mineral resources, despite the fact that the development of such mineral resources is not as advantageous as in other regions; attempting to organize the production of various equipment and auxiliary materials that should be manufactured in specialized factories within the region; and other deviations from economically rational management methods. Some local officials may have the intention to use more funds than the state can allocate to meet the local needs of provinces, territories, or republics, thereby harming the development of industries with national significance.

Party organizations, Soviet organs, economic organs, and trade union organizations should constantly pay attention to exposing these harmful tendencies of localism that are contrary to national interests and fight against them.

In the struggle against such phenomena, in addition to political leadership methods, it is necessary to fully utilize the powerful levers in the hands of the state, such as the unified national economic plan, centralized finance, and nationwide statistics. The State Planning Commission should carefully study the economic rationality of basic construction investments in various regions, eliminate all attempts to use funds to build the economy in a closed manner in individual regions, thereby harming state interests. If it is economically reasonable, it should be insisted in the plan that economic administrative regions and union republics further implement rational specialization, maximize the development of production cooperation within regions and republics and between them. This will help to develop extensive economic ties between republics and regions, prevent the occurrence of unilateral tendencies.

Planning agencies, statistical agencies, and supervisory agencies should promptly expose erroneous attitudes towards the implementation of national economic plan tasks and the facts of using materials and funds not in accordance with the designated purposes, and assist the government in preventing attempts to harm state interests. The timely completion of the state plan and the timely completion of the task of supplying products to other economic administrative regions should become a law in the work of national economic commissions.

11. The reorganization of the management of industry and construction requires the reorganization of state inspection work, establishing it on the basis of the participation of the broad masses of workers, and concentrating it in localities, republics, provinces, and economic administrative regions.

Accordingly, it is obviously necessary to fundamentally change the content and methods of work of the State Inspection Department of the USSR and the state inspection departments of union republics. The current structure of the State Inspection Department is large, established by departments, and attempts to grasp all issues, including supervising the technological development level of various production departments and the level of scientific and technological development, which will not be beneficial. Inspectors want to issue instructions on production issues, which is to replace the work of economic agencies. A serious shortcoming in the actual work of state inspection agencies is: they try to collect a large amount of data on various issues through their own staff and send them to the department for resolution, rather than relying on the help of the broad strata of Soviet society to overcome the shortcomings exposed on the spot.

Due to the reorganization of the management of industry and construction according to the principle of divisional management, new tasks will be generated, so it seems that new regulations for central and local state inspection agencies should be formulated, while paying attention to the implementation of Lenin's instructions on supervision and improvement of the work of state agencies.

12. Due to the reorganization of the management of industry and construction and the abolition of various industrial and construction ministries, it is necessary to change the membership of the Council of Ministers of the USSR.

Given that the role of the councils of ministers of union republics in leading the development of the national economy of the state will be significantly enhanced, the chairmen of the councils of ministers of union republics should be included as members of the Council of Ministers of the USSR.

In addition to the ministers of the remaining ministries and the chairmen of the state committees currently participating in the government, it seems that the chairman of the Engineering and Technical Committee, the director of the Central Statistical Bureau, and, based on the nomination of the chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, the deputy chairmen of the State Planning Commission of the USSR who can serve as ministers of the USSR and the directors of its main departments should be included in the Council of Ministers of the USSR.

Five, further expanding the powers of union republics and enhancing their role in economic management

1. The Communist Party, in implementing the plan for socialist construction, firmly implements Lenin's national policy and always pays attention to the economic and cultural development of union republics, autonomous republics, and all nationalities and ethnic groups of the USSR.

Formerly oppressed and backward nationalities of the old Russia, during the Soviet power period, established fraternal friendship relations with the peoples of the USSR and achieved great success in economic development and the flourishing of their own culture. For example, compared to 1913, the total industrial output value of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic in 1956 increased by thirty-five times, the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic by twenty-one times, the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic by twenty-nine times, the Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic by forty-one times, the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic by forty-four times, and the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic by twenty-six times, etc. The national form and socialist content of the culture of each union republic and each autonomous republic are becoming more and more prosperous. A clear sign of this is the training of national cadres. For example, in the Uzbek Republic, there were very few national intellectuals before the revolution, but now there are 150,000 specialists with higher and secondary specialized education. In Uzbekistan, there is a scientific academy, and nearly 6,500 scientific workers work in the scientific institutions of the republic, and more than 70,000 students study in 31 institutions of higher learning. In Kazakhstan, there were also almost no national intellectuals before the revolution, but now more than 230,000 specialists with higher and secondary specialized education work in the national economy of the republic; more than 5,000 scientific workers work in the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic Academy of Sciences, various scientific institutions, and schools, and nearly 50,000 students study in 25 institutions of higher learning in the republic.

All union republics and autonomous republics have established socialist industries equipped with advanced technology, with skilled local national workers and specialists, and have expanded the network of scientific research institutions and institutions of higher technical learning.

2. The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has already approved the measures taken by the Central Committee of the Party in recent years to expand the powers of the organs of the republics in economic and cultural construction. The Congress believes that it is necessary to further expand the powers of the republics to ensure the comprehensive development and prosperity of the economy and culture of all nationalities and ethnic groups.

The policy adopted by the 20th Party Congress to expand the powers of union republics in leading economic and cultural construction has achieved good results in the first year of implementing the resolutions of the Congress. This policy has ensured the further consolidation of our socialist system and state system, the strengthening of the economic power of the Soviet state, the improvement of the material well-being of the people, the more rational allocation of national productive forces, and the more comprehensive utilization of local resources and potential.

Now, each union republic and autonomous republic has trained skilled working-class cadres and engineering and technical intelligentsia, so we can and should further expand the powers of union republics and autonomous republics in leading economic construction to the benefit of the development of the national economy.

3. The reform of the management of industry and construction, the abolition of various industrial and construction ministries, the transfer of all-union-owned enterprises to the jurisdiction of union republics, and the establishment of national economic commissions in economic administrative regions will greatly expand the influence of the organs of republics, territories, and provinces on the leadership and further development of the entire industry and construction. The working people of each republic, if they consider the national interests of further developing the national economy, strengthening our country's strength, and continuously improving material well-being from the perspective of the national interests of developing the national economy, considering the historical characteristics of economic development, natural conditions, and excellent national traditions, considering the advanced experience of other union republics, territories, and provinces, the more fully they utilize the potential of their own republic, the more extensively they mobilize the creative enthusiasm, initiative, and pioneering spirit of the masses, the greater their contribution to the national cause.

4. Further expanding the powers of union republics in leading the economy will have a good impact on the development of the economy of each union republic and the development of the economy of the entire union. It is known that many union republics and many regions have obvious special directions in economic development, which reflect the division of labor that has historically formed and is extremely suitable for geographical, economic, and national characteristics. For example, in Uzbekistan, the leading sector in economic development is cotton. Therefore, here, the industrial sectors related to the processing of cotton should be widely developed, and the mission of machine-building enterprises is to serve these industrial sectors and agriculture. In Azerbaijan, Bashkiria, and Tatarstan, the leading sector is the petroleum industry. It is obvious that the production sectors related to the extraction and processing of petroleum should continue to be significantly developed in these places. In Kazakhstan, although agriculture is currently being vigorously developed, there are also all the conditions to further and more rapidly develop non-ferrous metallurgy, ferrous metallurgy, coal industry, and machine-building.

In the Russian Federation and Ukraine, many large industrial regions have historically formed and are developing successfully. These large industrial regions have good conditions for the development of various industrial sectors. Moscow and Leningrad have been decided to be the main centers for the production of precision machinery, supplying the most perfect machines and equipment to various economic sectors and regions of the country. In the Urals and Donbass, there are conditions for the successful development of many leading sectors of heavy industry. Siberia and the Far East regions also have such conditions.

Expanding the powers of union republics and autonomous republics, expanding the powers of local party organizations and Soviet organs of territories and provinces, will make it possible to more quickly solve the problem of comprehensive economic development in a certain economic administrative region. The implementation of these measures, in addition to having great economic significance, also has first-class political significance. These measures will play a promoting role in the future firm implementation of Lenin's national policy, the further consolidation of the friendship of all nationalities, and the strengthening of the cadres of all nationalities.

5. The reform of industrial management work will propose the issue of training and more rationally utilizing specialized personnel, and more rationally allocating the institutions of higher learning and secondary schools of each republic. Each economic administrative region will be concerned with training local engineering and technical cadres according to the needs of the development of the national economy of the republic, territory, and province. This will enable us to more quickly solve the task of transferring the base of schools to regions with corresponding industrial sectors. Institutions of higher learning and secondary technical schools will be more closely linked with the enterprises that train their cadres.

At present, many institutions of higher learning are located in Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev, Tbilisi, and other large cities. Only the four cities mentioned above concentrate about one-third of all the students in the country and more than 40% of the students in industrial and construction specialties. The detachment of specialized universities from production bases and the unreasonable geographical distribution of specialized universities have caused serious drawbacks in the organization of institutions of higher learning. The enrollment methods used by institutions of higher learning have serious drawbacks. At present, those who enter institutions of higher learning are generally young men and women who have just graduated from middle school, with little life experience and no familiarity with production.

Rationally distributing institutions of higher learning in various republics and regions will enable technical institutions of higher learning to be closer to production, mainly recruiting students from those who have engaged in production work. In addition, it is necessary to more extensively organize the training of engineers and technicians through correspondence networks in factories and through institutions of higher learning and secondary schools, from non-full-time young workers.

6. The new management institutions of industry and construction will play a promoting role in enhancing the role of science in the development of production and in the more targeted organization of scientific research work by union republics, territories, and provinces according to the specific needs of industry and construction in their areas.

Under the existing organizational conditions of scientific research institutions, many scientific research institutions only serve the narrow needs of their subordinate ministries and authorities. Scientific research institutes under the jurisdiction of authorities often lead to the result that several scientific institutions of the same profession are working in the same city.

In 1956, there were a total of 496 industrial and construction scientific research institutes in the country, with about 45,000 scientific workers. In the total number of scientific research institutes, 40% are concentrated in Moscow and the Moscow region, under more than 40 ministries and authorities. The Ministry of Chemical Industry alone has 15 scientific research institutes in Moscow, while the Ministry of Petroleum Industry has 7 research institutes in Moscow. In Leningrad and the Leningrad region, there are 76 industrial and construction scientific research institutes, with about 8,500 scientific workers.

Only in Moscow and Leningrad, more than three-quarters of the workers of industrial scientific research institutes and construction scientific research institutes are concentrated, but in many union republics, there is a serious shortage of industrial and construction scientific service cadres. This situation cannot be considered normal.

The task of struggling for technological progress requires the work of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, the academies of sciences of union republics, and their institutes and laboratories to be close to production.

7. Some comrades are concerned that if the management of industry and construction is organized according to the principle of regionalism, transferring all-union-owned enterprises to the jurisdiction of union republics, it seems that it will weaken our unified planned principle of Soviet economic development. This is of course incorrect. The USSR is a state composed of fifteen sovereign socialist republics. The national economy of the USSR is managed according to the unified national economic plan approved by the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, which summarizes the plans of all union republics. This plan combines the interests of each union republic, autonomous republic, territory, and province with the interests of socialist expanded reproduction, strengthening the national defense forces of the entire USSR, and improving the material and cultural level of the people.

Six, enhancing the role of Soviet organs, party organizations, and trade unions in economic construction, and more widely involving the working masses in production management work

1. The measures to further improve the organizational work of managing industry and construction have great significance for fundamentally improving the forms and methods of economic construction management at the central and local levels. The implementation of these measures requires tremendous organizational work for party organizations, Soviet organs, economic organizations, trade unions, and Komsomol organizations.

In the years of Soviet power, our social organizations have accumulated the most precious experience in leading economic construction and currently have a large number of highly skilled cadres who can successfully solve the most complex problems of developing industry and construction. Under the conditions of adopting new institutions, the role of these organizations in economic construction, in involving the broad masses of workers in the management of production, in organizing nationwide socialist competition to complete and overfulfill state plans, will become increasingly important.

2. The Soviets of Workers' Deputies, from the establishment of the workers' and peasants' socialist state, have been the true organs of people's power. There are more than 1.5 million representatives of various levels of local Soviets and the Supreme Soviet, hundreds of millions of workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals—the members of various committees and standing committees of various levels of Soviets, executing the will of the working people, the mandates of voters, and engaging in enormous and multifaceted activities in various levels of Soviets. Lenin once said: Our revolution "through the Soviet power aroused millions of people who were previously indifferent to the cause of state construction to actively participate in this construction" ("Lenin Collected Works," Vol. 31, p. 467, translated from "Economic Translation Collection," 1954, No. 5, p. 3).

At present, measures are being taken to bring the leadership of economic construction closer to production, under which the role of the Soviets of Workers' Deputies of republics, territories, provinces, cities, and districts should be greatly enhanced, and the work of the Soviets should be more active. As pointed out in the resolution of the 20th Congress of the CPSU: The great tasks of building communism require the working people to further enhance their creative enthusiasm and initiative, and require the masses to participate more widely in the management of the state, in the various organizational work and economic work of the state. For this purpose, it is necessary to vigorously promote Soviet democracy, persistently improve the work of Soviet organs at the central and local levels, and strengthen their ties with the masses.

The main issues of the work of industrial enterprises and construction units in completing state tasks, the correct use of all possible conditions and local resources to improve production, the concern for the continuous improvement of the well-being of the working people and the completion of the plans for the construction of housing and cultural life, the display of creative initiative in all aspects of economic and cultural construction—all these important issues should always be the focus of attention of the Soviets of Workers' Deputies at various levels.

3. To reorganize the management of industry and construction, it is necessary to fundamentally improve the work of trade unions and enhance their role in economic construction. The trade unions, which have united 45 million people in their ranks, according to Lenin's definition, "should be the closest and most necessary comrades of the Soviet power, and the Soviet power, in all its political and economic work, is led by the vanguard of the working class—the Communist Party. Trade unions are generally schools of communism, and for the entire working class and all laborers, they should also be schools for learning to manage socialist industry (and later also gradually manage agriculture)" ("Selected Works of Lenin," Vol. 2, p. 925, People's Publishing House).

The trade unions of the USSR, in all stages of the development of our country, in socialist construction, in solving various political and economic tasks, and in involving the working people in the management of production, have played a significant role. However, due to the fact that the leadership of various industrial enterprises and construction units is scattered among a large number of ministries and authorities, it often has a negative impact on the work of trade unions. At present, there are a large number of trade unions in the country that are narrowly specialized by production sector, with cumbersome organizations, overlapping levels, and too many full-time (paid) positions. The factory committees of trade unions often do not show the necessary initiative and persistence in solving the fundamental tasks of improving the production activities of enterprises, and pay little attention to issues such as labor norms and labor organization, wages, safety technology, rationalization and invention, housing construction, and improving the material living conditions of workers and staff.

The reorganization of trade union work according to economic administrative regions will bring trade union organizations closer to production and create more favorable conditions for the active participation of trade union organizations in the management work of workers. Trade unions will have more opportunities to delve into planning work issues, into issues of improving labor productivity, and to have a more active influence on the production activities of enterprises and construction units. Trade unions can more concretely address issues such as socialist competition, the development of mass invention and rationalization movements, the supervision of the implementation of guarantees in collective agreements, the supervision of the implementation of resolutions passed at workers' meetings, workers' and staff production meetings, technical meetings, conferences of economic activists of enterprises and agencies, and in addition, can more concretely handle issues related to improving the working and living conditions of workers and staff.

Due to the need to change the management institutions of industry and construction, it is obviously necessary to merge trade unions, which will make it possible to improve the work of trade union organs at the level of republics, territories, and provinces, overcome the phenomenon of overlapping leadership levels, reduce the number of full-time (paid) positions, and widely promote the spirit of innovation within trade union organizations.

4. The Leninist All-Union Leninist Communist Youth League, which plays an important role in economic construction, is our glorious Soviet youth, who have made valuable contributions in various sectors of socialist construction. The organizations of the Komsomol and youth have always shown initiative and pioneering spirit, set examples of labor heroism in solving the greatest national tasks, in the construction of industrial centers and enterprises, and in the reclamation of virgin lands. Under modern conditions, new prospects for development are open to Komsomol members and youth, who can better display their creative initiative in economic construction, help party organizations, Soviet organs, and economic organizations improve the work of enterprises and construction units, develop natural wealth to comprehensively develop the economy, especially in the eastern regions of our country, cultivate skilled cadres for all sectors of the national economy, and select talented organizers and leaders from young workers and specialists to various positions in industry and construction units.

5. The richest experience of forty years of development of the Soviet socialist state proves that the achievements of our country, which have world-historical significance, are the results of the tremendous organizational work of the Communist Party in implementing the general line of Lenin, which aims to fully develop the national economy and its main foundation—heavy industry, consolidate the strength of the Soviet homeland, and continuously improve the well-being of the people. The reorganization of economic leadership according to the principle of regionalism will infinitely enhance the sense of responsibility of party organizations at all levels of republics, territories, and provinces in the development of production and construction in each economic administrative region, require party organizations to delve deeper into the economic issues of industry and construction, effectively and concretely lead industrial enterprises and construction units, and strengthen their organizational work among the masses.

Under the current leadership system, the formulation and implementation of plans are carried out through various specialized ministries and authorities, and local party organizations often do not have the opportunity to have a more active influence on the work of enterprises, more fully utilize the economic potential of each region and each province, overcome harmful barriers in the management system, and more widely develop production cooperation within the scope of a district, province, territory, and republic.

The new form of management of industry and construction will give party organizations at all levels of republics, territories, and provinces more powers and conditions to influence the process of implementing the state plan, influence the production activities of enterprises and construction units, and implement the resolutions of the party and government on the development of the economy and the continuous improvement of the living standards of the working people.

The great October Socialist Revolution opened up a broad path for us to transform the state according to new socialist principles. Lenin believed that the main task facing the party after the victory of the revolution was to vigorously develop all the productive forces of the country and, on this basis, improve the material well-being of the people. Lenin once said that we have everything we need to build a truly strong and prosperous socialist republic: boundless natural wealth, a vast human resource, and limitless creative power of the people.

The high-speed development of our national economy and the continuous improvement of the material well-being of the people are guaranteed by the fact that the party has consistently implemented Lenin's policy of prioritizing the development of heavy industry. Light industry, agriculture, and other sectors of the national economy can only develop smoothly on the basis of a powerful and ever-growing heavy industry.

To produce abundant food, footwear, clothing, and other daily necessities, to build housing, hospitals, clinics, schools, kindergartens, and nurseries, it is first necessary to have equipment for light industry enterprises, metals, coal, oil, electricity, cement, and other building materials. In addition, it is necessary to have the necessary number of agricultural machinery and mineral fertilizers for agriculture. All of the above can only be provided by heavy industry, and only it can provide them. Therefore, it is not allowed to interpret the role and mutual relationship of heavy industry and light industry too simply, to harmfully oppose these sectors, and the party has always considered such an understanding and view as a distortion of Marxist-Leninist principles.

Only under the conditions of comprehensive and highly developed "A" category industrial sectors, that is, heavy industry—metallurgy, fuel industry, power, machinery, and chemistry—can the necessary conditions be created for the development of all sectors of light industry and agriculture. If this is not done, if incorrect, seemingly reasonable views are accepted, and the main funds are used for the development of "B" category industrial sectors, that is, light industry sectors, only superficial achievements can be obtained, only some needs can be temporarily satisfied, but this will destroy the foundation for the future development of our economy. This is not allowed, because it means deviating from the only correct Leninist line and dooming the national economy to stagnation.

Therefore, in the future, we must firmly advance along the path of prioritizing the development of heavy industry—the path that has been tested by the entire development process of the USSR. Of course, we must not take things to an absurd extent, nor can we neglect the development of light industry while developing heavy industry one-sidedly. If this is done, it will inevitably lead to difficulties in the development of the national economy and hinder the further improvement of the living standards of the people. It is necessary to rationally allocate basic construction funds to ensure that heavy industry and light industry maintain the correct proportional relationship at all times.

As the 20th Congress of the CPSU reiterated, the task facing our country is to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita output. However, these countries are not standing still, but are developing under certain conditions. To catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita output, it is necessary to ensure the correct proportional relationship between basic construction investments in "A" category and "B" category, and to prioritize the development of heavy industry.

The development of heavy industry will make it easier to achieve the comprehensive mechanization and automation of production, which will make it possible to greatly reduce labor, improve labor productivity, and continuously improve the living standards of the Soviet people.

The policy of prioritizing the development of heavy industry can also ensure the equipping of the national economy with advanced technology, and can maintain the high level of the national defense forces of the USSR. For this reason, the enemies of the USSR have always and are currently striving to defame this great Leninist idea, because this idea is the general line of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

Our party, in the past, present, and future, will adhere to this Leninist path of socialist development, which has been tested by the experience of the USSR, great China, and various people's democratic countries over many years.

Only this path can lead us to the sacred goal: the construction of a communist society. Because only in a communist society can all the needs of people in labor and life be satisfied.

Every time there is a need for fundamental reforms in the life of the state, every time major events occur, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union always consults with the broad laboring masses of our country, consults with the people. This is also very natural, because the entire activities of the Communist Party are inseparable from the life of the Soviet people, and the party, apart from the interests of the people, apart from caring for the well-being and happiness of the people, has no other interests. This time, when the necessity of fundamentally reorganizing the leadership of industry and construction has matured, the party again consults with the people and submits the proposals for discussion.

The Communist Party of the Soviet Union Central Committee and the Council of Ministers of the USSR, in publishing this outline, call on all laborers of the USSR to actively participate in the discussion and study of the proposals on the reorganization of the management of industry and construction, so as to find the most correct path in this great and extremely important matter.

The people of the USSR are the sovereign and sole masters of their own country. Everything that is built on our land is the crystallization of the creative labor and creative genius of the people. The labor of the people, the consciousness of the people, the wisdom of the people, are the sources of strength for our country's victories in advancing towards a bright future—communism.

    关于进一步改进管理工业和建设的组织工作
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志的报告提纲
    苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议公告
    苏联共产党中央委员会2月全会讨论了“关于进一步改进管理工业和建设的组织工作”问题之后，委托苏共中央主席团和苏联部长会议就改革工业和建设的领导工作提出具体建议，并且考虑到这个问题所具有的全国性的重大意义，将其提交苏联最高苏维埃审查。
    苏共中央主席团和苏联部长会议根据这项委托向即将召开的苏联最高苏维埃会议提出关于进一步改进管理工业和建设的组织工作问题。确定尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志为这一问题的报告人。
    苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议对于这次改进管理工业和建设的组织工作，赋予极其重大的意义。
    苏共中央和苏联部长会议决定在报纸上发表报告的提纲，并对这个问题进行全民的讨论，以便在广泛交换意见和全面考虑我们现有经验的基础上制定出最合理的管理我国国民经济的形式。对工业和建设的管理工作实行改革应当遵循一定的方向，提纲中阐明了这一方向的基本原理。提纲中不准备以完备的形式介绍有关中央和地方经济管理新结构的一切具体问题。全民的讨论将能够找到在现代条件下管理工业和建设的最完善的组织形式。
    各加盟共和国共产党中央委员会、党边区委员会和省委员会、各加盟共和国部长会议、边区和省的劳动者代表苏维埃执行委员会在就提纲组织全民讨论的同时，应当不浪费时间，立即制定关于改革管理工作的措施，对国民经济委员会的构成准备具体建议。同时必须仔细考虑正确安排干部的问题，以便把能够顺利处理工业企业和建筑工程的领导工作的高度熟练的专门人材和经验丰富的生产组织者提到国民经济委员会和计划机关的领导工作上来。
    由于对工业和建设的管理工作实行改革，结果将从目前的部局中精简出很多人。他们之中绝大多数人都是高度熟练的专门人材——工程师、技术员、经济员、职员。必须关切地对待他们，根据各主管机关精简的工作人员的熟练程度和经验注意安排他们的工作。这些同志会正确地理解党和政府所采取的措施，会在直接创造物质财富的生产中重新担负起生动的组织者的工作，这一点是不必怀疑的。他们将发挥更大的效率，继续自己的劳动活动，为我们的社会主义国家谋福利。
    苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议号召党的、苏维埃的、工会的和共青团的组织在企业里、工地上、在科学组织、国家机关、集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和报纸刊物上就进一步改进管理工业和建设的组织工作展开讨论，保证最广大的劳动群众积极参加这个问题的讨论，因为这个问题对于顺利解决建设共产主义的任务具有重大的意义。
    苏联共产党第二十次代表大会拟定了我国经济文化建设的宏伟计划。代表大会着重指出，苏联发展国民经济的主要任务是：在优先发展重工业、不断改进技术和提高劳动生产率的基础上，保证进一步大力发展国民经济的各个部门，急速发展农业生产，并在这个基础上大大提高苏联人民的物质福利和文化水平。现在苏联已拥有一切必要条件，通过和平经济竞赛在最短的历史时期内解决苏联的基本经济任务——在按人口计算的产量方面赶上并超过最发达的资本主义国家。
    现在苏联有强大的、全面发展的、以先进技术装备起来的社会主义工业，有比任何时期都更丰富的物质资源，国民经济各个部门都有熟练的工人干部和技术干部。在我国当前经济发展的水平上，进一步改进经济领导和完善工业和建设的管理工作，具有特殊意义。
    在1956年12月和1957年2月召开的苏联共产党中央委员会的两次全体会议上对第二十次党代表大会决议的执行情况作了初步总结，并拟定了取得社会主义建设新成就的具体措施。第六个五年计划的第一年1956年的总结表明：苏联正满怀信心地向前迈进，它以飞快的速度发展着国民经济。为了进一步发展国民经济，如苏共中央二月全会所指出的，必须在工业和建设的各个环节上改进管理工作的组织形式，包括管理工作的基本环节——生产领导工作，以便更好地利用苏联社会主义经济的巨大潜力和可能性。
    鉴于整个苏联、各加盟共和国和各经济区的生产力的发展水平业已大大提高，而地方上也培养了大批的熟练干部，党中央委员会认为，必须采取措施，进一步改进管理工业和建设的组织形式，以便使这种形式适应共产主义建设现阶段的国民经济任务和要求。
    党中央二月全会委托苏共中央主席团和苏联部长会议就改革工业和建设的领导工作提出具体建议，并且考虑到这个问题所具有的全国性的重大意义，将其提交苏联最高苏维埃审查。
    一、管理经济建设的列宁原则和苏联经济发展的若干总结
    1、苏联人民和各国劳动者在今年纪念伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年。四十年以前，俄国的工人阶级同劳动农民结成联盟，推翻了资本家和地主的统治，把政权掌握在自己手里，创立了世界上第一个劳动者的国家——苏维埃社会主义共和国。工厂、运输、土地、森林、一切自然财富都变成人民的财产。劳动人民破天荒第一次成了自己祖国的真正主人，从此肩负起按照新的社会主义原则组织国家经济并在没有资本家和地主、没有剥削者参加的条件下管理这种经济的任务。苏联人民在创立自己的社会主义国家时，是沿着未经开辟的道路前进的，同时要克服巨大的困难。如所周知，我们的国家在沙皇制度下是经济落后的国家，第一次世界大战及随之而来的帝国主义掠夺者对年轻苏维埃共和国的进攻进一步地削弱了它，并且使它遭到经济破坏。
    在这种极端困难的条件下，由列宁领导的共产党动员了亿万劳动群众去保卫十月的果实，去恢复国民经济。苏联在击退了帝国主义者的武装进攻之后，主要以自己的经济建设去影响国际的发展。列宁说：“世界规模的斗争已转到这条战线上来。我们一定能完成这项任务，到那时我们将无疑地在国际范围内取得彻底胜利。因此经济建设的问题对于我们确实具有极其重大的意义。”（列宁全集，第32卷，第413页）
    2、共产党在着手解决经济建设的任务时，曾集中主要力量去恢复和发展运输业、燃料工业、冶金业，去建立大规模的机器工业，因为机器工业是国家整个国民经济的基础，是保证国家独立和巩固国防的基础。在制定和实现经济建设计划时，党赋予国家电气化以头等意义。党是以马克思列宁主义的基本原理为依据的，这就是只有重工业是社会主义的物质基础，必须把任何一点微小的积蓄保存起来，用以发展大规模的机器工业，发展电气化。
    按照社会主义原则改造落后的小农经济，建立大规模的机械化的集体农业，这是建设社会主义的极复杂的任务之一。列宁的合作化计划成了党对农业进行社会主义改造，建立集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工作纲领。
    共产党从苏维埃政权的最初时日起，就十分注意提高劳动群众的文化水平，在我国实现文化革命，培养人民的知识分子，为国民经济各个部门培养熟练干部。
    由此可见，共产党已经有了列宁制定的有科学根据的社会主义建设纲领，这个纲领规定实现国家工业化和电气化，按照社会主义原则实行农业集体化，实现文化革命，发展国内各民族的经济和文化，开展全民的社会主义竞赛。这就从思想上武装了党，向人民指出了建设新生活的明确道路，掀起了广大劳动群众的创造热情。
    3、为了顺利地完成既定的国家经济发展计划，必须制定出与工农社会主义国家的真正民主原则相适应的新的国民经济管理形式和方法。在社会主义国家中正确地组织国民经济的管理工作，对于不断扩大物质生产、巩固国家经济实力、提高社会劳动生产率、提高人民的福利以及更充分地利用国民经济中的潜力，是有莫大意义的。因此经济建设问题，管理各个国民经济部门的问题一向是共产党和苏联政府注意的中心。
    早在苏维埃政权的初期，列宁拟定经济建设纲领时曾说过，民主集中制的原则应当是社会主义经营管理的基本原则，它有可能把国家对经济的集中领导同最大限度地发挥直接参加生产管理的劳动群众的创造积极性结合起来，同发挥地方机关的主动性和提高他们对完成国民经济计划的责任心结合起来。
    列宁写道：集中制从真正民主的意义来理解，它是以历史第一次提出的下述可能性为前提的：即无阻碍地充分发展地方特点、地方创议、地方主动性以及达到总目标的途径、方法和手段的多样性。
    社会主义国家中发展国民经济的一个极重要的原则就是计划化——按全国统一的计划管理我国的国民经济。列宁说：“只有按照大规模的总计划进行并力求均衡地利用经济资源的建设，才配称为社会主义建设。”（列宁全集，第28卷，第19页。）
    苏联国民经济发展的历史证实了列宁的社会主义建设管理原则的伟大生命力，这些原则为人民群众积极参加生产管理提供了无限可能性。
    4、苏联人民在共产党的领导下坚持不渝地实现着列宁的计划，在短暂的历史时期内建成了社会主义。人民通过忘我的劳动在几个五年计划的时期内在我国建立了强大的社会主义工业，这就有可能在技术上重新装备国民经济各个部门，无比地提高苏联的国防能力。伟大的卫国战争令人十分信服地证明了，旨在实现国家工业化和优先发展决定性的重工业部门的党的列宁的总路线是多么英明而有远见。
    战后时期苏联的国民经济向前迈进了一大步，已经提高到新的更高的水平。社会主义工业和农业是在现代科学技术成就的基础上向前发展的。在制造现代机器和仪器，在国民经济中利用电子学、掌握原子能并将其用于和平目的方面所获得的优异成就就是技术进步的明证。
    在苏维埃政权的年代里，我国在经济发展方面赶过了许多资本主义国家，而在工业生产水平方面已跃居世界第二位。到1957年苏联工业产值比革命前增长二十九倍，比1940年增长约三倍。同时机器制造业和金属加工制品的生产为1913年的一百八十倍，电力生产约为1913年的一百倍。社会主义工业发展中的这种辉煌成就是在苏维埃政权的四十年内达到的，而且其中至少有十八年用于国内战争和第二次世界大战以及随之而来的国民经济的恢复工作。这一点确切地证明，不论是战前或战后社会主义工业都是以资本主义发展历史上从未有过的高速度向前发展的。
    苏联建立了大规模的机械化的农业。社会主义工业以现代化机器装备了农业，这些机器担负着主要农业工作，大大减轻了男女庄员、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工作人员的劳动。最近几年一系列农业生产部门的发展都获得了巨大的成就——通过开垦生荒地和熟荒地大大扩大了播种面积，去年采购的谷物比1955年多十亿余普特。我们的国家从来没有收获到像去年这样多的谷物。技术作物的产量也增加了，畜牧业产品特别是牛奶的生产也增长了。
    人民的生活水平在发展工农业的基础上也在不断地提高。苏维埃制度的优越性和我们党的正确政策使我们有可能在提高人民的物质福利方面获得重大的成就。提高苏联人民福利的最具有概括性的指标就是苏联国民收入的增长。从1913年到1956年，我国的国民收入按人口计算增长了十二倍。任何一个资本主义国家的国民收入也没有这样高的增长速度。例如美国的国民收入按人口计算，在此期间增长不到一倍，而英国和法国只增长60％。同时苏联的全部国民收入是按照劳动者的利益分配的，而资本主义国家中却有半数以上的国民收入被剥削阶级所占有。
    苏联实现了文化革命以后，已经变成没有文盲的国家。在苏维埃政权的年代里，造就了新的真正人民的知识分子，为所有国民经济部门和文化建设事业培养了有高度素养的干部。如果说革命前俄国受过高等和中等专门教育的专门人材还不到二十万人，那末现在苏联国民经济中已拥有六百余万受过高等和中等专门教育的专门人材。现在有五千万人正在接受各种形式的教育，这就是说，苏联每四个人之中就有一个人在学习。
    上述材料说明，在苏维埃政权的年代里，我们的国家在共产党的领导下已经在自己的经济建设中、在提高人民物质福利和生活水平的工作中获得了辉煌的成就。从而它极清楚的表明：人民粉碎了资本主义枷锁并把政权夺取到自己手里以后，如果按照社会主义原则管理没有剥削者的经济，能够创造出什么样的业绩。
    在现代的条件下，当苏联已经不是唯一的社会主义国家，当人民中国、社会主义阵营所有国家都在同苏联并肩前进（总共包括九亿余人口），这时新世界建设者大军的面前已展示出无限宽阔的远景，现在已经有一切条件来实现劳动人类的理想——建设共产主义。
    二、国民经济的增长情况和改进管理工业和建设的组织形式的工作
    1、社会主义经济的发展要求不断改进管理工业和建设的组织形式和方法，要求不断改进国民经济计划工作的方法。
    我国在经济建设的最初阶段，建立了如下国家管理机关，如最高国民经济委员会和地方国民经济委员会，国家计划委员会和地方计划机关，这些机构在以后起了重大作用。
    从解决恢复时期的任务转向实现社会主义工业化的伟大计划，必须在短时期内建立若干新的工业部门，同时也必须有新的管理经济建设的组织形式。当时曾按最重要的国民经济部门建立了专业管理局，以后又建立了人民委员部、部和局。这种经济领导形式使我们能够集中党和国家的力量来建设具有决定意义的重工业部门，培养能够掌握新技术并能在现代科学技术水平上管理大规模工业生产的高度熟练的工程技术干部和生产组织者。
    2、战后时期，我国工业和整个国民经济达到了更高的水平，这时在生产的发展中发生了新的质变，这时迫切要求建立更新的工业部门和建设部门，更进一步实行专业化，建立更专门的专业部和局。这一点与新技术的发展、技术进步的任务和新的科学成就（它引起现代工业生产组织中的巨大质变）有关。
    目前，苏联共有二十余万个国营工业企业和十余万个建设工地，它们分布在辽阔祖国的各个地区。在这种条件下，一个部或一个局很难对大量企业和工地实行具体而有效的领导。在现有的生产规模的条件下，目前的工业和建设的管理形式不能适应具体而有效地领导国民经济发展的日益增长的要求，它们限制了充分利用社会主义经济体系内部的潜力。
    进一步发展国民经济的利益，要求在工业和建设各个环节改善管理工作的组织形式。为此，必须放弃工业领导方面的某些陈旧的组织形式，以便避免进一步分散技术管理、经济管理和行政管理，采取能够更充分地考虑省、边区和共和国特点的更灵活的管理国民经济的形式。
    目前提出根本改革工业和建设的领导工作的问题，并不是因为我们在执行国民经济发展计划当中发现了什么毛病。苏联的工业过去和现在都稳步地向前发展，关于国民经济计划执行情况的资料完全可以证明这一点。改革管理工作的组织形式，首先是为了使我国的生产力有更广阔的发展余地，为了更充分地利用我们现有的巨大潜力，以期进一步发挥劳动群众的创造主动性和积极性，保证进一步发展国民经济，提高苏联人民的物质福利。改革管理工业和建设的措施，将有助于克服目前工业和建设管理工作中的许多缺点。
    3、本位主义的障碍是工业和建设领导工作中的重大缺点，它往往有碍于许多极重要的发展国民经济问题的解决。许多事实表明，由于某些经济领导者以狭隘的本位主义态度来对待工作，致使国家遭到很大损失，使许多迫切的国民经济任务长期不能解决。让我们以拖拉机生产这样一个重要问题作例子。农业机关的工作人员和机器制造者都清楚地知道，轮式拖拉机在许多工作上是大大优越于履带拖拉机的。某些机器拖拉机站和外国农业工作的经验告诉我们，履带拖拉机在拖拉机总数中所占的比重以10％左右为宜，轮式拖拉机应占90％左右。根据轮式拖拉机和履带拖拉机的这个比例，1957年履带拖拉机的生产就要减少几万台，而按同样的数目增产轮式拖拉机。这种替换具有如下优点（按一台五十五马力拖拉机计算）：金属消耗可减少二点二吨；每一马力的拖拉机重量可减少三分之一，有色金属消耗差不多可减少30％，生产中的劳动消耗量可减少50％以上，这就可以在同样的生产面积上增加拖拉机的生产。拖拉机的成本将降低20％左右，拖拉机进行每公顷工作的修理和技术养护的价值差不多可以降低一半。
    由此可见，如果把履带拖拉机改为轮式拖拉机，那末每生产十万台，国民经济就可以节约五万六千吨金属压延品，六万八千吨灰口铁，九万二千五百吨铸钢和将近四千吨有色金属。同时，得自降低成本的总节约额将为一亿六千万卢布。利用这笔资金可以设置年产四十万只橡胶轮胎的生产能力，而这些轮胎足可以装备十万台拖拉机。虽然这种替换对国民经济有很大好处，但由于部与部间的本位主义的争论，致使这个问题不能及时解决。
    重要的国民经济问题淹没于本位主义的争论之中，这种事实，在其他的工业和建设部门里也是存在的。
    4、本位主义的态度会削弱，而且往往会破坏同一经济行政区内不同工业部门的企业间的正常的生产联系。以狭隘本位主义的态度对待事物，就远不能充分利用一切可能来切实解决当地的经济问题，更合理地分配现有的物力、人力和财力，以及采取具体措施尽速消灭在执行计划当中发现的缺点。
    由于各个部的狭隘本位主义，许多企业的一部分生产能力不能合理地加以利用。例如，列宁格勒每年生产三十六万吨铸铁和铸钢，而列宁格勒的企业只能使用二十五万吨，其余部分都运往别的地方。与此同时，列宁格勒还运入四万吨大型铸铁和铸钢。由于不缺乏生产能力，所以必须严格限制建设新的翻砂车间。但由于存在严重的本位主义倾向，不合理的建设依然在进行。例如，在列宁格勒，本来有一个年产约三万吨铸铁的“列宁格勒机床翻砂厂”，但在斯维尔德洛夫机床制造厂内又建立第二个年产五千吨铸铁的铸铁车间，同时还有第三个已经动用的能力为四千吨的车间。尽管这些工厂相隔不远，尽管“列宁格勒机床翻砂厂”每年还要运出八千多吨同样的铸件，但那里还在建立翻砂车间。这种做法给国家带来了巨大的物质损失。
    这种缺点在其他地方也是屡见不鲜的，它们之所以发生，是因为生产计划以及新车间和新工厂的建设计划是由每个部个别制定的，它们在制定这种计划的时候，不考虑别的部在做些什么，不考虑各个地区的特点，不吸收地方工作人员参加。
    5、目前许多部局之间建筑机构互不通气，这种情况给国民经济带来了很大损失。这会使得同一个城市或同一个地区内的每一个建筑机构都要建立自己的生产基地，而且还要设立许多附属企业和事业，建立自己的汽车运输和供应仓库。这样一来，用于建立建筑基地的拨款便大大增加，而基地的工作效果反而缩小。
    由于这种互不通气的情况结果一个省或一个城市里的建筑工作往往由许多建筑机构进行。例如，齐略宾斯克省境内的建筑工作是由二十五个部和局的一百八十二个建筑安装机构进行的；斯维尔德洛夫省的建筑工作是由三十个部和局的二百零三个建筑安装机构进行的，这些建筑安装机构往往各自用自己的力量在同一个区同一条街上进行建筑工作。事情竟弄到这种地步，例如在斯维尔德洛夫斯克的库兹巴斯街，八幢住宅的建筑工作曾委托给属于七个不同部局的建筑机构去进行。在别尔哥罗德这样一个省城里集中了属于八个部局的六个建筑机构和七个专业建筑机构，它们共同完成九千万卢布的建筑工作。
    由于以上情况，用来建设工业企业和住宅的资金被分散了，施工期限延长了，造价大大提高了，建筑机器和交通工具得不到很好的利用，行政管理人员的工资支出增加了，结果，国家付出了很高的代价。莫斯科、列宁格勒和许多其他城市的联合建筑机构的工作经验表明，按地区管理的这种扩大的建筑机构可以克服上述缺点，并可大大改善施工的质量指标。
    6、在现行的工业和建设的管理制度下，往往每个部都尽力为自己准备好一切，而不考虑资金和物资的消耗，不考虑这样会使生产面积和设备得不到充分利用，会造成相向运输、远程运输和其他的不合理运输。
    例如在机器制造业中，由于没有充分发展企业的专业化和协作，所以铸件、锻件和冲压件的生产分散在许多部局的大量小企业中。生产铸铁、铸钢和冲压件的专业化工厂的比重仍然很小。
    目前的生产协作主要是在部门内部进行，各部企业之间的协作还是很差的，这样便不能很好地利用生产能力。例如，建筑机器和筑路机器制造部的基辅“红色掘土机”工厂改建和扩建了翻砂车间，目前，这个工厂向该部在塔什干、列宁格勒、斯维尔德洛夫斯克、古比雪夫、库尔斯克、伊热夫斯克，以至秋明和库尔干的企业供应铸件。与此同时，其他部又把大批铸件从这些城市运往国内其他地区。在这种情况下，铸件转运的路程达三千五百多公里。铸铁由基辅“红色掘土机”工厂运至秋明，其运费占铸铁生产价值的20％以上。如果以更经济的观点对待问题，其他部的企业生产的铸件是可以供给当地的建筑机器和筑路机器制造厂的，这样就可以避免相向运输。但部的狭隘的本位主义利益不允许从全国利益出发来合理地解决这个问题。不合理的货物运输给国民经济带来很大损失。
    7、使我们必须改革工业和建设的管理工作的另一个极重要的原因，就是要更合理地利用专门人材和更广泛地吸收广大的地方工作干部参加对工业和工地的领导工作。
    党和政府在为国民经济各部门大量培养专门人材的时候，特别注意了工程技术干部的培养。1928年，我们有九万八千名工程师和技术员，而现在他们已达到一百六十多万人。在苏维埃政权的年代里，我国的高等学校培养了三百五十多万专门人材，其中工程师约占一百万。科学工作者的数量大大增加了。1913年，科学机关和高等学校中的科学工作者只有一万多一点，而现在有二十四万。
    这些资料表明，我国拥有一支多么庞大的熟练干部的队伍。然而目前的情况是：大量有才干的生产组织者和工程技术人员不能直接参加生产，而被留在管理机构中。
    近年来，我们曾进行了巨大工作来克服组织构成方面的缺点和消除管理机构中人浮于事的现象。最近三年来，管理人员、采购人员和其他非生产人员共减少了九十多万人，其中很大一部分人都参加了生产。但是，经济管理机构仍然是臃肿的。
    改革工业和建设的领导工作，使我们能够大大精简机构，克服使用熟练干部方面的现有缺点，并把从管理机构和服务机构中精简出来的人员调到直接创造物质财富的企业和工地。
    8、目前各工业部和建筑部的结构是重叠繁复的。部和局从中央领导分布在全国各地的企业，这样不可避免地要设立许多平行机构——各种供销办事处、供应站和托拉斯等。在各个部里设有许多总局、管理局、处和其他分支机构。负责领导西伯利亚企业、中亚细亚企业、远东企业和其他遥远地区企业的地区总管理局一般都设在莫斯科。部的机构臃肿，这样，解决企业所提出的问题就要经过很长的途径和通过重重叠叠的许多机构。由于各机关之间互不通气，由于部和总局远离企业和工地，所以部的工作人员不得不拿出许多时间来写信、制定和发布命令和指示、拟定和发送通报和报告，而不能很好地在工厂和工地进行实际的组织工作。部里发出的大量文件，使企业的许多工作人员脱离了具体工作。很多专家离开生动的生产工作，从地方被召到中央，在部里耽搁几个月之久。
    所有这些缺点对于企业和工地计划的编制和执行都造成了不良影响，使现有的生产能力不能充分利用，使资金分散于大量的建筑工地。
    9、管理工业和建设的部门构成，对于企业和工地的物资技术供应的组织工作也有不良影响。每一个部和局都有自己的一套庞大的供销机构。供应机构网既臃肿，又费钱。在工业中心，照例同时存在着不同部局的许多供销机构。例如，列宁格勒有一百二十三个供应机构，哈尔科夫省有七十四个，新西伯利亚省有七十六个。部往往在同一个城市里设立几个平行的供应办事处和代办处。例如，苏联建造部在莫斯科有十五个供应机构，在列宁格勒有九个，在明斯克有七个，在新西伯利亚有六个。
    虽然各部都有庞大的供应机构，但在企业和工地上仍然时常发生原材料供应不及时和不齐备的现象。这给企业和工地的工作造成困难，破坏工作的节奏性，有时使工人和设备停工，使大批物资积压和冻结在某些企业，而另一些企业又感到不足。部远离企业，不能很好地了解企业的需要，而且常常不能及时采取措施来满足企业和工地的需要。
    10、为了进一步发展我国的国民经济，苏共中央二月全会认为必须采取这样的经济建设领导形式，它能把地方上具体而有效的领导同严格遵守全国范围内集中的计划原则充分地结合起来。根据上述方针来改革工业和建设的领导工作，一定能进一步加强领导国民经济的列宁的民主集中制原则和计划基础。列宁一再强调，苏维埃国家和共产党在集中领导社会主义建设的时候，必须广泛吸收地方机关来解决经济问题。列宁说：
  “地方上各部门的工作不相协调，这是阻碍经济建设的一大恶事。对此问题必须寄予极大的注意。……在地方上，既然更接近工农群众，这些缺点就表现得更明显些，因而地方机关应当通过交流经验研究出一套与这些缺点作有效斗争的方法来。”（列宁：“劳动国防委员会给地方苏维埃机关的指令”，见“经济译丛”1954年第4期，第9—10页。）
    三、共和国、边区和省管理工业和建设的机关
    1、根据当前国民经济发展阶段进一步提高国民经济的任务，必须把工业和建设的日常领导的重心移到地方，使其更加接近企业和建设单位。为此，显然应当改变过去那种通过各专业部和主管机关进行管理的组织形式，采取新的分区管理的形式。比如，国民经济委员会，就可能成为这种管理形式。在这方面进行的改革，将有利于在经济建设方面进一步贯彻列宁的民主集中制原则。这一原则，要求在保证中央的领导作用的条件下，充分发挥群众和地方机关的创造积极性。
    大家知道，弗·伊·列宁认为新的经济建设管理机关——最高国民经济委员会和地方国民经济委员会具有莫大的意义。弗·伊·列宁在1918年说过：“现在，最高国民经济委员会担负着一项艰巨而又最荣誉的任务。毫无疑义，十月革命的胜利果实愈是向前发展，已由十月革命开了端的这个变革愈是深入，社会主义革命胜利的基础愈是奠定得牢固，社会主义制度愈是巩固，则国民经济委员会的作用就愈加增大，愈加提高。在一切国家机关中，国民经济委员会将是一个唯一保持自己的坚固地位的机关，我们愈是接近于建立社会主义制度，对于纯粹行政机关，对于实质上只是专门做管理工作的那些机关的需要愈是减少，则国民经济委员会的这种地位将愈巩固。在彻底粉碎剥削者的反抗以后，在劳动者学会组织社会主义生产以后，——这种原来意义下的、狭义的管理机关，旧有国家机关必归死亡，而最高国民经济委员会这种类型的机关，必然增长、发展并强固起来，囊括有组织的社会的一切最主要的活动。”（参看“列宁文集”，人民出版社版，第6册，第102页）
    现在，国家已有了强大的物质技术基础，大批高度熟练的专业干部、企业和建设单位的领导人员业已成长起来，工人阶级的人数增加了许多倍，工人阶级的文化技术水平无可估量地提高了，对国民经济实行分区领导的有利条件已经具备。
    这种管理形式将给予各共和国、边区和省的苏维埃机关、党组织、经济机关和工会组织很大的权利，提高它们发展经济的责任心，更多地吸引广大的劳动群众来领导经济建设。
    2、如果认为应当采纳关于设立共和国、边区和省国民经济委员会这种工业和建设的地区管理机关的建议，那么管理工业和建设的各联盟部、共和国部的存在就没有必要了。根据目前苏联国民经济发展的条件，根据各地拥有熟练干部和工业产量有了增长的情况，经济行政区的国民经济委员会能够成为管理工业和建设的最适当的机构。
    国民经济委员会一般应当按照现存的行政建制设立，同时必须考虑各省、边区和共和国的工业发展水平。举例来说，这种经济行政区就是斯维尔德洛夫斯克省、齐略宾斯克省、巴什基尔苏维埃社会主义自治共和国，其中每一个都有高度发达的工业。按整个乌拉尔这样大的经济区设立国民经济委员会是完全不适当的，因为如果这样组织管理工作，就不能创造条件，来切实有效地、具体地领导大量工业企业和建设单位。
    然而，国民经济委员会没有必要在所有各省、边区和自治共和国建立，而应设在工业相当发达的地区。自然，在决定是否成立国民经济委员会时，必须具体分析各省发展工业和建设的全部条件。在某些情况下，有些省虽然工业不很发达，但因散处边远地区，需要在当地设置管理机关，因此在那里建立国民经济委员会可能也是合理的。雅库特苏维埃社会主义自治共和国和马加丹省就可以作为这方面的例子。在其他工业不发达的省里，看来应当把几个相邻省份的工业管理工作合并起来。例如，列宁格勒国民经济委员会可以同时管辖诺夫哥罗德、普斯科夫这两个邻省的工业企业，甚至还可以管辖沃洛哥达省的工业企业。在乌克兰共和国内，里沃夫国民经济委员会可以管辖德罗戈贝奇、斯丹尼斯拉夫、外喀尔巴阡、沃伦、罗夫诺、捷尔诺波尔、契尔诺维茨等省境内的企业。但是，这个问题必须在仔细研究以后才能决定。
    可能在某些加盟共和国内，特别是在那些不分省的共和国内，应设一个国民经济委员会。这个问题也需要进一步讨论。
    3、省、边区和共和国的国民经济委员会将是管理工业和建设的基本环节，它根据发展国民经济的全国计划所规定的任务，直接管理所属企业和建设单位。在计划工作问题上，国民经济委员会受双重领导，即服从加盟共和国政府和苏联政府。
    因此，应当修改划分工业隶属关系的现行办法。今后，应将工业分为联盟兼共和国工业和地方工业两种。各共和国的企业哪些应划入联盟兼共和国工业，哪些应划入地方工业，还须按每个地区进一步加以研究。
    现在属于联盟部和联盟兼共和国部的工业企业，公司（原字为“КОМБИНАТ”，通常译为“联合工厂”或“联合企业”，但根据本文的提法，这一单位是在国民经济委员会之下负责领导企业和建设单位的机构之一，所以似乎译为“公司”较恰当；如我国鞍山钢铁“公司”等，在俄文中也叫作“КОМБИНАТ”。——译者）托拉斯和其他生产联合组织、建设单位、物资技术供应系统的办事处和基地以及其他单位，加上一部分共和国工业企业，都应当移交国民经济委员会管辖；另一部分共和国工业企业则应移交地方苏维埃管理。
    4、边区、省和共和国的国民经济委员会将享有进行经济活动和财务活动所必需的各项权利，并对其所属企业生产计划的完成情况和企业活动的经济效果负完全责任。
    国民经济委员会的任务，将包括制定和实行长期和短期生产计划，制定企业专业化计划，生产协作计划、经济行政区内部及同其他省和共和国互相供应原料和半成品的计划；编制和实行物资技术供应计划。
    5、国民经济委员会应在地方机关积极参加下，根据全国利益，有效地解决本省或本共和国发展工业和建设的任务。
    成立国民经济委员会，便能就地解决各项重大的经济问题，许多这一类问题以前只是由各部、各主管机关在中央处理的。
    重新组织工业和建设的领导工作，国民经济委员会就能建立一些统一的建筑机构，以它们代替各部、各主管机关所属为数众多的各种小型建筑机构，这样将加速建筑工程的进度，加快生产能力的动用，并有可能更合理地使用建筑机械和降低建筑造价。
    成立国民经济委员会，将提供广泛的可能性，来利用企业的内部潜力，在经济行政区内部及各地区、各共和国之间大规模地发展专业化和协作。
    6、国民经济委员会的机构不应臃肿庞大，其组织机构将根据各省、边区或共和国的实际需要和特点加以确定。
    在国民经济委员会之下，宜设立技术经济委员会，其中应包括一些高级专家，生产革新者和先进生产者，党组织，苏维埃机关，经济机关，工会组织，科学研究机关和其他单位的领导人员。技术经济委员会的基本任务是：研究省、边区或共和国工业发展和区内生产协作的总的问题，讨论重大生产技术问题和经济问题，讨论保证完成计划、提高劳动生产率、降低产品成本和提高产品质量等措施。国民经济委员会应当把自己的工作建立在劳动人民普遍参加工业和建设管理工作的基础上。
    领导企业和建设单位的主要工作，应集中于国民经济委员会所属各公司、托拉斯和按部门组成的其他经济联合组织。而国民经济委员会则应保持一个不大的机构。应当根据其所属企业的数量和各部门企业的现有组织形式，在国民经济委员会的机构内设立一些不大的处，如计划处、物资技术供应处、财政处、劳动处等。
    现在属于联盟部和联盟兼共和国部的大多数设计机构、科学机关、试验机关和产品设计机构，都将转交国民经济委员会管理。
    除了解决改进对大工业和建设的领导这一任务以外，共和国机关和地方机关还应当解决改进地方工业管理工作的问题。
    地方工业的管理工作可以全部集中由地方苏维埃机关掌握。不少纯粹地方性的企业现在归共和国部和联盟兼共和国部管辖。这些企业可以移交给地方劳动者代表苏维埃管理。地方工业的管理工作集中由地方机关掌握，这将提高它们在经济领导中的作用。
    自治共和国部长会议以及边区和省的劳动者代表苏维埃，有权听取有关经济行政区国民经济委员会主席的报告，从而参加本共和国、省或边区境内工业和建设发展的管理工作，积极影响国民经济计划的执行进程。此外，现在将工业和建设的领导工作完全交给边区、省和自治共和国的地方劳动者代表苏维埃掌握是不合适的，因为地方所属工业的产量在显著增加，而且领导进一步发展农业的任务极为重大。
    四、关于进一步改进计划工作及改组计划、统计和监督机关的工作
    1、以生产资料公有制为基础的社会主义生产关系的本质，要求必须对国民经济实行有计划的集中领导。我国社会主义建设的全部经验证明，对国民经济实行集中领导，共产党指导国民经济有计划地发展，乃是社会主义经济不断高涨的保证。国家计划使党和政府有可能统一我国经济发展的目标和步调，最合理地利用我国的经济资源，把这些资源用来解决国民经济中最重大的任务。同资本主义制度相比，同资本主义所固有的对抗性矛盾、竞争和生产无政府状态相比，社会主义制度的一个根本优越点，就是国民经济的计划管理。
    弗·伊·列宁认为按照全国统一的计划来发展国民经济具有头等重要的意义，他着重指出了国家计划委员会在实现这项任务方面所起的巨大作用。列宁在1922年末写道：
    “国家计划委员会虽然作为内行、专家、科学技术代表的总和，实质上握有正确判断事情的最多的材料，但它是稍微离开我们的立法机关的。
    然而，我们一直认为，国家计划委员会应当给国家提供经过批判分析的材料，而国家机关则应当决定国家大事。在国家大事异常复杂化的现时情况下，往往要解决很多错综复杂的问题，在这里面，需要国家计划委员会鉴定的和不需要它鉴定的问题是交错在一起的，而且需要国家计划委员会鉴定的某些方面是和不需要它解决的方面交错在一起的，因此我想，在目前，应采取步骤来扩大国家计划委员会的职权。”（见“批判斯大林问题文集”，第二辑，人民出版社1956年版，第336页。）
    在现今的国民经济规模的条件下，国家计划委员会和地方计划机关所起的作用更大了。苏维埃政权建立的最初几年，在国家计划委员会工作的绝大多数科学家都带有资产阶级观点和资产阶级偏见，即使那时，列宁尚且谈到必须提高国家计划委员会的作用，而现在，国家计划委员会和计划机关的干部都是在苏维埃政权下成长起来的专家，他们在计划工作和领导社会主义经济方面积累了丰富的经验，因此进一步提高国家计划委员会在经济建设中的作用，就更有必要了。目前，情况发生了变化，有了具备渊博科学技术知识和丰富实际经验的干部，所以已有十分优越的条件来实现弗·伊·列宁的指示，即：进一步扩大国家计划委员会制定国民经济计划和使实现国民经济计划的行动协调一致方面的职权。因此，没有必要建立新的中央经济领导机关，来代替正待撤消的各专业部。
    有些同志建议在部长会议之下设立苏联部长会议所属各委员会之类的专门经济机关，负责领导重工业的各主要部门。这就是说，某些工业部门照旧要由中央管理。
    这些建议实质上只是在新的名称下以更坏的形式保留旧的管理形式。如果要保留中央按部门管理工业和建设的形式，那就不可避免地还要保留目前管理机构所固有的那些严重缺点。
    建议成立的中央机关，必然要建立一套同当前各部和总管理局的机构相类似的机构，否则，它们就不能执行为其所规定的管理职能。像现有的各部一样，这些机关的工作与国家计划委员会有关专业部门的工作将会重复，它们将会浪费许多力量和时间，占用很多熟练工作人员来同国家计划委员会接洽商讨
  各种问题。
    提这些建议的同志也许耽心，在年度计划和五年计划执行中会产生各种实际问题，而这些问题应有一个机关来解决。这一类在计划编制过程中未考虑到的问题当然会产生。然而，这些问题只有交国家计划委员会研究才合适，因为没有国家计划委员会的参与，任何一个其他平行的机关还是无法解决这些问题的。不能让这些问题不经过国家计划委员会和国民经济委员会径自处理。
    拟定对工业和建设的管理实行改组，要求根本改进国家计划委员会的工作，使国家计划委员会在工作中依靠各经济行政区的国民经济委员会和各加盟共和国的国家计划委员会，统一和协调它们的工作，及时将重大问题提请苏联部长会议和苏共中央审查。
    这种改组，要求用精通生产经济和生产技术、在工业和建设方面具有实际工作经验的熟练工作人员，来进一步加强苏联国家计划委员会、加盟共和国国家计划委员会和地方计划机关。
    2、苏联国家计划委员会应成为国家国民经济的科学的计划经济机关。它应在研究国民经济的需要并考虑科学技术成就的基础上提出发展国民经济各部门的建议，建议中必须缜密地考虑综合发展经济和根据全国利益更合理地利用资源的可能性。必须加强国家计划委员会对完成其所定计划的责任心。
    除五年计划外，国家计划委员会还应制定为期更长的远景计划。根据这些计划，应确定国民经济各部门之间的正确比例关系和各经济区的发展方向。列宁曾经指出：“……不能无计划地工作，不能没有旨在获得重大成就的长期计划”（“列宁全集”第31卷，第479页）。
    国家计划委员会不应干预经济行政区的行政管理。它的职责是研究各地区发展中的重大问题，通过计划确定国民经济的发展方向和发展速度，规定各加盟共和国和各经济行政区国民经济各部门发展的必要比例。
    这种计划改组方法，使国家计划委员会有可能在计划中更好地反映进行共产主义建设、进一步巩固我们的社会主义国家、发展我国经济和文化、不断增进人民福利等任务。在计划中，必须根据各地区合理专业化的原则和发展远景，规定：正确而合理地配置生产力，实行工业的专业化，建立各地区间在经济上合理的经济联系，综合发展各经济区的经济。
    苏联国家计划委员会应制定并报送政府批准建立国家物资储备和粮食储备的计划。
    3、苏联国家计划委员会必须彻底改进国民经济发展计划的编制工作。计划工作必须做到在当年就确定下一年的主要计划指标，在本五年计划期内就确定下一个五年计划的基本轮廓。这些计划指标都应分加盟共和国并按每一经济行政区进行编制。国家计划委员会除编制国民经济长期计划外，还应制定年度计划。
    此外，苏联国家计划委员会应当担负目前由各部实施的某些职能，即保证在重要工业部门的发展中贯彻统一集中的政策。这些职能首先就是合理地配置企业，正确地指导工业的技术发展，监督工业工作经济指标的改进。同时，看来有必要授予苏联国家计划委员会一定的职权，以便有效地处理那些涉及统一各国民经济委员会在实现国民经济计划方面的工作步调的问题。
    苏联国家计划委员会应在各国民经济委员会和各共和国国家计划委员会所定计划的基础上进行综合计划工作。无论长期计划和短期计划，都必须在考虑每个经济行政区的一切可能性的基础上进行编制。在制定综合计划时，国家计划委员会要研究和考虑：已制定的地方计划的正确程度如何，这些计划能在该地区产生什么效果，它们在多大程度上符合发展全国国民经济的利益，以免发生比例失调现象，保证国民经济各部门的均衡发展，使各经济行政区发展经济的计划互相衔接。
    国家计划委员会在分析各经济行政区编制的计划时，应当杜绝闭关自守和本位主义的现象，以免一个地区的利益同全国的利益发生对立。
    国家计划委员会在研究各地报来的各经济行政区的计划时，应从发展国民经济、正确配置生产力、保持各工业部门发展的比例关系、大规模实行专业化和协作、实行生产全盘机械化和自动化、采用最新科学技术成就等利益出发，对各国民经济委员会的计划进行修正。
    既然拟定改组苏联国民经济的管理工作，在日常计划方面和长期计划方面的主要计划工作都将集中于各经济行政区，国家计划委员会将集中从事苏联国民经济的综合计划工作并将受权统一各国民经济委员会在执行计划方面的活动，因此国家经济委员会在现阶段已经不宜存在，应该予以撤消。
    苏联国家计划委员会还须负责编制国民经济物资技术供应计划并处理这一计划执行中的日常问题。看来国家计划委员会的职责中还应包括一件工作，即根据生产计划和物资技术供应计划，编制原材料、燃料、电力、设备和人民消费品的区际供应计划。同时，在国民经济的供应工作中，要做到使没有列入国民经济计划的产品的主要部分直接由各国民经济委员会进行分配。看来，应当集中分配的只是那些数量有限的真正极其缺乏的产品。在初期当各企业之间以及各经济区之间还没有建立巩固的经济联系的时候，国家计划委员会在新的条件下可能要编制某些虽不列入国民经济计划、但具有重大国民经济意义的产品的供应计划。国家计划委员会还必须监督各经济区严格遵守在互相供应工业产品方面的国家纪律。
    4、由于改组工业的管理工作和提高苏联国家计划委员会在国民经济计划领导中的作用，必须改变国家计划委员会的机构。看来，在苏联国家计划委员会内应专设一个长期计划司，并按国民经济部门设立一些专业司，司内设相应的处。国家计划委员会各司应有精通生产技术与生产经验的工程师和经济专家，他们不仅要做计划工作，而且要经常到企业和建设单位去就地安排执行计划的工作。这些专家应该钻研技术中和经济中的新事物，并且把新事物推广到生产中去。国家计划委员会内由精明能干的组织者和大专家领导的各司，不仅将处理计划工作方面的种种问题，而且要对计划的执行情况进行监督。苏联国家计划委员会各主要司的领导人员，就其素养与经验来说，应具备现任部长的水平。
    看来应在苏联国家计划委员会中建立委务会议。委务会议的成员除了国家计划委员会的主席、副主席、国家计划委员会各主要司的领导人以外，还应包括一些大专家。在国家计划委员会委务会议上，必须研究有关国民经济及其各部门发展的重大问题。要求政府决定的问题，应由国家计划委员会报请苏联部长会议审批。
      由于建立国民经济委员会，以及联盟所属企业下放，改为联盟兼共和国企业，各共和国国家计划委员会的作用，特别是俄罗斯联邦共和国和乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国国家计划委员会的作用，将会大大提高。各国民经济委员会的计划工作问题和工作的协调问题，首先应由各共和国国家计划委员会来解决，而这就要求根本改组这些国家计划委员会的工作，以有经验的领导人员和熟练的专家加强国家计划委员会。
    编制计划的全部主要工作应当转交给地方，即各经济行政区。编制计划的工作，应从企业、有关的经济联合组织、国民经济委员会、共和国国家计划委员会开始，然后再在苏联国家计划委员会中进行。
    苏联国家计划委员会和各共和国国家计划委员会，必须做到使各经济行政区的计划能保证在该地区发展那些具有最优越条件的工业部门。应该特别注意发展各国民经济委员会所属工业之间的经济联系。国家计划委员会的重要任务之一，将是分析这些联系，帮助发展最合理的经济联系，一旦发现有不合理的联系，就要积极过问。
    5、应当讨论在苏联部长会议之下设立工程技术委员会以代替现在的国家技术委员会的问题。
    工程技术委员会应保证：研究各部门的国内外先进技术，出版有关书刊，分发给各企业和科学研究机关，以帮助它们在科学技术最新成就的基础上进行自己的工作。
    工程技术委员会应当监督国民经济中采用科学技术最新成就的情况，帮助国家计划委员会和各国民经济委员会确定国民经济各部门发展计划必须达到的科学技术水平，同时应考虑到科学技术的最新成就。
    为了技术进步，在国家发展国民经济计划中需规定采用新技术的措施，以便在新技术的基础上经常改进和提高社会生产。
    工程技术委员会在自己的全部工作中，必须依靠优秀的工程师、科学家和生产革新者。为了尽速掌握并在生产中采用重要的技术成就，工程技术委员会应吸收那些提过有价值的技术建议、有所发现或发明的生产革新者、高级工程师、科学工作者和工人参加委员会的工作，为他们创造一切必要的条件，以便把这些建议和发明普遍推广到生产中去，并对提出这些建议的人员给予物质奖励。应当经常进行工作，发掘这样的革新者，邀请他们同委员会进行合作，以便在发明者和合理化建议者的直接参加下，把最好的发现、发明和合理化建议推广到有关生产部门中去。委员会工作人员的成份，将通过吸收不断涌现出来的生产合理化建议者和发明者而不断得到更新。
    6、鉴于国内建设和设计中的许多共同问题必须处理，看来应当保留现有的苏联部长会议国家建设委员会。
    国家建设委员会应负责统一建筑和标准设计方面科学研究工作、实验工作的步调，进行技术情报工作，推广国内外建筑业中的先进经验，出版建筑和建筑艺术方面的技术书籍。国家建设委员会的职责中将包括：编制和批准建筑和设计中的某些通用标准和技术规范、建筑安装工程和专业工程施工验收技术规范、各种建筑标准、建筑安装工程预算定额和工人产值的统一定额。国家建设委员会应帮助国家计划委员会和各国民经济委员会，根据建筑科学和技术的最新成就，制定进一步发展建筑工业和降低工程造价的主要技术措施。
    国家建设委员会，应根据政府规定的任务，对大型企业和大型建筑物的设计和建筑预算进行技术鉴定，对大型工程项目的设计和预算的质量进行重点检查。
    7、如果全国国民经济中没有统一的、集中的计算和统计体系，共产主义建设任务就不可能得到顺利解决，因为对产品的生产和分配组织严格的全民的计算和监督，是正确管理国民经济的最重要条件之一。
    集中进行全国国民经济的计算和统计工作，就是把收集和编制报表资料的全部工作都集中在中央统计局各机关内进行。必须进一步加强从区、省直到中央的整个国家统计体系。这一点必须通过撤消计算和统计工作中的平行环节来实现。
    中央统计局各机关所应收集、编制和分析的，不应局限于说明各国民经济委员会和经济联合组织工作结果的资料，而且还应当有反映尚未利用的潜力、揭露统一国民经济计划所定任务完成得不好的事实的资料。
    规定计算和统计的组织时，必须做到使工业企业和建设单位仅向苏联中央统计局的机关报送报表，其指标数量尽可能减少。今后，在国民经济其他部门，特别是在农业、商业、保健事业等部门也应该实行计算和统计工作集中进行的措施。
    集中进行计算和统计，只有在计算和统计工作广泛机械化的基础上才能顺利实现。必须在中央统计局系统内普遍建立机器计算站，为这些计算站配备现代化的高效率计算机和最新的通讯设备。
    在实行集中计算和统计的措施时，应该大大简化和缩减现在的计算资料和报表。企业和建设单位的原始计算资料也应该缩减，消除在这方面存在的繁冗现象，最大限度地实行原始计算机械化。
      8、工业和建设管理工作的改组，必将显著改善国家物力和财力的使用情况，提高企业的赢利，增加经济内部积累，并且较快地消灭目前还存在的非生产性开支和损失，从而最充分地利用工业潜力。
    国民经济委员会应对所属各专业经济联合组织、托拉斯、公司和管理局的财务活动负完全责任，并通过这些机构对各企业和建设单位的财务活动负完全责任。国民经济委员会应负责财务计划工作，调配财力，对利润和流动资金进行再分配，并建立必要的财政后备。国民经济委员会应采取的必要措施，保证提高各专业经济联合组织的赢利，保证它们完成和超额完成积累计划。经济联合组织应该享有现在各部总管理局那样的经济核算权利。必须认真地加强经济核算制，扩大各企业和经济机关领导人员的权限。除产量和劳动生产率之外，赢利和生产基金利用情况也应当规定为计划和考核企业、建设单位活动的主要指标。
    在新的条件下，应该根据国家的统一财政制度，提高财政机关在动员资金和保证国民经济计划所规定的事业拨款方面的作用。还必须提高各企业和经济机关对完成本单位财务计划的责任心。应该采取措施，使企业自有流动资金、基本建设拨款、干部培养费和其他费用的大部分，都靠企业利润来解决。
    为了保证及时而全部地把周转税上缴预算，一般应直接向企业征收周转税，而不要像现在这样，向销售机关征集。同时必须规定根据上缴预算的利润提成直接进行结算的办法。
    应该提高国家银行和长期投资银行的作用，加强它们同国民经济委员会和企业的联系。
    鉴于在国民收入分配中和居民货币收支平衡表中必须保持正确的比例关系，工资、农业原料价格和零售价格的调整应当统一进行。
    对工业和建设改用分区管理的办法，不应使资金积累减少，以免丧失进一步发展国民经济的重要泉源。社会主义积累应当根据全国利益进行分配，并首先用于国民经济的各主要方面。同时应当指出，在许多情况下，积累可能在某一些共和国内形成，但是国家却需要在另一些共和国内发展经济。在这个问题上如果放松领导，资金就可能被分散，就可能不是用于扩大再生产，而是用于其他需要，对这些需要国家所能拨给的积累暂时还不可能超过一定的限度。工业和建设的预算拨款，应当根据国家计划规定的任务及其完成情况来进行。
      9、在新的工业和建设管理机构之下，国民经济的物资技术供应工作应当在保留物资集中计划分配的条件下实现分区管理。同时，对各地区物资的集中计划分配，应当同授予各国民经济委员会利用分得的材料和当地原料来发展工业生产和建设事业的完全独立性相结合。
    应当把供应和销售这两种职能合并为一，在现有的小型供应办事处的基础上建立属于国民经济委员会的大规模的部门间专业供销基地。
    国民经济委员会可以通过这些专业基地，进行对经济行政区企业的全部供应工作以及区内区外的产品销售工作。
    部门间的基地能够更具体地研究企业对原材料的需要，对需要单位进行调查，——了解它们是否妥善保管和使用物资、是否遵守消耗定额，发掘超定额的多余材料和产品。
    在工业管理工作改组期间，看来应保留各省之间已形成的产品供销联系，以免各工业企业和建设单位所需原材料的供应间断。
    在供货企业和消费企业之间新的固定的联系建立之前，在各经济行政区内保证就地执行供销职能的新的供销机关巩固之前，看来应当把现在从事产品销售工作的许多机关暂时保留下来。
    在改进物资技术供应方面，主要是发展消费企业与供货企业间直接的合同联系，这是一种最合理的、经济上有利的物资供应和产品销售形式。物资供应合同中应当严格规定在按规定
  日期、产品数量和质量履行供应条件方面所应担负的财产责任。企业应该更多地注意印发本企业出产的产品的样本。这将有助于改进企业之间的联系，使它们有可能了解出产产品的目录，给自己选择生产上需要的产品。
    发展供货企业和消费企业之间的直接联系，就有可能消除通过集中的主管供应机关和销售机关来组织供销工作所存在的严重缺点。采用这种办法，企业就没有必要向许多在中央从事供销工作的机关报送申请书。
    为了保证工业企业和建设单位毫不间断地，有节奏地进行工作，需要建立原料、金属、燃料、各种材料和制品的必要后备，普遍组织专门的售货仓库，向企业和建设单位自由出售某些材料和制品。
    10、由于对工业和建设的领导将由地方负责进行，各经济行政区可能会出现闭关自守的倾向和在地区内部故步自封地建设经济的企图。这些倾向可能表现为：力求依靠本地区的矿产发展自己的原料基地，尽管这类矿产的开发不如其它地区有利；企图在本地区内组织生产应在专业化工厂制造的各种设备和辅助材料；以及发生脱离经济合理的经营管理方法的其它偏向。某些地方工作人员可能有这样的企图：使用比国家能够拨给的资金更多的资金来满足省、边区或共和国的地方需要，因而损害具有全国意义的工业的发展。
    党组织、苏维埃机关、经济机关和工会组织应该经常注意揭发这些与全国利益背道而驰的有害的地方主义倾向，并同这些倾向作斗争。
    在同这类现象进行斗争时，除了政治领导手段以外，必须充分利用掌握在国家手中的各种有力杠杆，如统一的国民经济计划、集中的财政和全国性的统计等。国家计划委员会应当详细研究各地区所定基本建设投资的经济合理性，杜绝个别地区利用资金来故步自封地建立经济因而损害国家利益的一切企图。如果在经济上是合理的，则在计划中应当坚持使各经济行政区和加盟共和国进一步实行合理的专业化，最大限度地发展各地区和共和国内部以及它们之间的生产协作。这将有助于在各共和国和各地区之间发展广泛的经济联系，防止发生独树一帜的倾向。
    计划机关、统计机关和监督机关应当及时揭发执行国民经济计划任务的错误态度和不按指定用途使用物资和资金的事实，并协助政府防止违反国家利益的企图。及时完成国家计划、及时完成对其它经济行政区供应产品的任务，应当成为国民经济委员会工作中的一条法律。
    11、工业和建设管理工作的改组要求重新组织国家监察工作，把监察工作建立在吸收广大劳动群众参加的基础上，把监察工作集中到地方、共和国、省和经济行政区去进行。
    与此相适应，显然应当彻底改变苏联国家监察部和各加盟共和国国家监察部的工作内容和工作方法。目前的国家监察部机构庞大，是按部门建立的，并且企图抓住所有问题，直到监督各生产部门的技术发展水平及科学技术发展水平，这样做不会有什么好处。监察员想对生产问题发布指示，这就是代替经济机关的工作。国家监察机关实际工作中的严重缺点是：他们力求靠自己的工作人员的力量收集有关各种问题的大量资料，并把它们送到部里去解决，而不是依靠苏维埃社会广大阶层的帮助就地克服揭露出来的缺点。
    由于按分区管理的原则改组工业和建设的管理工作，将要产生一些新的任务，因此看来应当制定中央和地方国家监察机关的新条例，同时要注意实现列宁关于实行监督和改进国家机关工作的指示。
    12、由于工业和建设管理工作的改组以及各工业部和建筑部的撤销，有必要改变苏联部长会议的成员。
    鉴于各加盟共和国部长会议在领导发展国家国民经济方面的作用将大大提高，应吸收各加盟共和国部长会议主席作为苏联部长会议的成员。
    除了保留下来的各部的部长和现在参加政府的各个国家委员会的主席以外，看来还应当吸收工程技术委员会主席、中央统计局局长，并根据苏联部长会议主席的提名，吸收那些可以担任苏联部长的苏联国家计划委员会副主席及其各主要司的司长参加苏联部长会议。
    五、进一步扩大各加盟共和国的职权并提高它们在管理经济方面的作用
    1、共产党在实现社会主义建设计划的时候，坚决贯彻列宁的民族政策，经常关怀加盟共和国、自治共和国、苏联所有民族和部族的经济和文化的发展。
    从前受压迫的落后的旧俄国的民族，在苏维埃政权时期，和苏联各族人民建立了兄弟般的友谊关系，而在发展经济和发扬自己文化方面取得了很大的成就。如以1956年全部工业的总产值来和1913年相比，哈萨克苏维埃社会主义共和国增加了三十五倍，白俄罗斯苏维埃社会主义共和国增加了二十一倍，格鲁吉亚苏维埃社会主义共和国增加了二十九倍，吉尔吉斯苏维埃社会主义共和国增加了四十一倍，亚美尼亚苏维埃社会主义共和国增加了四十四倍，塔吉克苏维埃社会主义共和国增加了二十六倍等等。每个加盟共和国和每个自治共和国的民族形式的、社会主义内容的文化都在日益繁荣。这方面的一个明显标志，就是造就人民知识分子的民族干部。例如，在乌兹别克共和国，革命以前自己的知识分子为数很少，而现在却有十五万受过高等和中等专业教育的专门人材。在乌兹别克斯坦设有科学院，在该共和国科学机关中工作的科学工作人员，差不多有六千五百人，而在三十一所高等学校中学习的大学生，就有七万多人。在哈萨克斯坦，革命以前也差不多没有自己的民族知识分子，而现在该共和国的国民经济中却有二十三万多个受过高等和中等专业教育的专门人材工作；在哈萨克苏维埃社会主义共和国科学院、各种科学机关和学校中工作的科学工作人员，有五千多人，在该共和国二十五个高等学校中学习的大学生，差不多有五万多人。
    所有的加盟共和国和自治共和国，都建立了用先进技术装备起来的社会主义工业，具有熟练的本地民族的工人干部和专门人材，并在扩充科学研究机关和高等技术学校的分布网。
    2、苏联共产党第二十次代表大会，已经赞同党中央委员会最近几年为扩大各共和国机关在经济文化建设方面的职权所采取的措施。代表大会认为必须进一步扩大共和国的职权，以保证全国所有民族和部族的经济和文化得到全面的发展和繁荣。
    第二十次党代表大会为扩大各加盟共和国在领导经济文化建设方面的职权而采取的方针，在实现代表大会决议的头一年就获得了良好的效果。这个方针保证我国社会制度和国家制度的进一步巩固，苏维埃国家经济实力的加强，人民物质福利的提高，全国生产力的更合理的配置和地方资源及潜力的更充分的利用。
    现在，每个加盟共和国和自治共和国都造就出来熟练的工人阶级干部和工程技术知识分子，所以我们可以而且应当更加扩大加盟共和国和自治共和国在领导经济建设方面的职权，以利国民经济的发展。
    3、改革工业和建设的管理工作，取消各工业部和建造部，将全联盟所属的企业交归加盟共和国管辖，并且在各经济行政区设立国民经济委员会，这能使共和国、边区和省的机关大大扩大它们对领导和进一步发展整个工业和建设的影响。每个共和国的劳动人民，如果从进一步发展国民经济、加强我国实力和不断提高物质福利的全国性利益出发，考虑到历史上形成的经济发展特点、自然条件和优秀的民族传统，考虑到其他加盟共和国、边区和省的先进经验，愈充分地利用本共和国的潜力，愈广泛地发挥人民群众的创造积极性、主动性和首创精神，便愈能对全民事业作出更大的贡献。
    4、进一步扩大加盟共和国领导经济的职权，对发展每个加盟共和国的经济和发展全联盟的经济都有良好的影响。谁都知道，苏联许多共和国和许多地区在发展经济上显然都有特殊方向，它反映着历史上形成的并和地理、经济、民族等的特点极适应的分工。例如，在乌兹别克斯坦，发展经济的主导部门是棉花。因此，在这里，与加工棉花有关的工业部门就应当得到广泛的发展，而机器制造企业的使命就是要为这些工业部门和农业服务。在阿塞拜疆、巴什基里亚、鞑靼，主导部门是石油工业。显而易见，与石油开采和加工有关的生产部门，在这些地方也应当继续得到显著的发展。在哈萨克斯坦，目前虽然正在大力发展农业生产，但也有一切条件来进一步、更加迅速地发展有色冶金业、黑色冶金业、煤炭工业和机器制造业。
    在俄罗斯联邦和乌克兰，历史上已经形成许多大工业区，而且正在胜利地发展。这些大工业区都有发展各种工业部门的良好的条件。莫斯科和列宁格勒已经决定为精密机器制造业的主要中心，供应各个经济部门和全国各地区最完善的机器和设备。在乌拉尔和顿巴斯，有条件来胜利发展重工业的许多主导部门。西伯利亚、远东各地区也有这样的条件。
    扩大加盟共和国和自治共和国的职权，扩大边区和省的地方党组织和苏维埃机关的职权，能够更加迅速地解决在某一经济行政区全盘发展经济的问题。实现这些措施，除了重大的经济意义而外，还有头等的政治意义。这些措施，对于今后坚决贯彻列宁的民族政策、更加巩固各族人民的友谊、加强全国所有各民族的干部，都将起推进的作用。
    5、改革工业管理工作，将按新的方式提出这样的问题：培养和更合理地使用专门人材，更合理地配置各共和国的高等学校和中等学校。每个经济行政区都会关心按照发展共和国、边区、省的国民经济的需要来培养本地的工程技术干部。这使我们能更加迅速地解决把学校基地转移到设有相应工业部门的地区的任务。高等学校和中等技术学校将和靠它们培养干部的企业更加紧密地联系起来。
    现在，许多高等学校都设在莫斯科、列宁格勒、基辅、第比利斯和其他某些大城市。仅仅上述四个大城市就集中了约有三分之一的全国所有高等学校学生和40％以上工业专科和建筑业专科的大学生。专科大学的脱离生产基地，以及专科大学不合理的地域分布，使高等学校的编制产生了严重的缺点。高等学校所惯用的招生方法，有着严重的缺点。现在进高等学校的，一般都是刚从中学毕业、既无生活经验又不熟悉生产的男女青年。
    使高等学校更加合理地分布在各共和国和各地区，就能使高等技术学校接近生产，主要从进行过生产工作的青年中间招收学生。此外，还必须直接在工厂里，以及通过高等学校和中等学校的函授网，更广泛地组织培养工作，从不脱产的青年工人中间培养工程师和技术员。
    6、工业和建设的新管理机构，对于提高科学在发展生产方面的作用，以及对于各共和国、边区和省根据本区工业和建设的具体需要而更有目的地组织科学研究工作，都将起推进的作用。
    在科学研究机关采取现有组织的条件下，有许多科学研究机关就只为其所属的部和主管机关的狭隘需要服务。科学研究所由主管机关管辖，往往就会造成这样的结果：同一个城市里有好几个属于同类专业的科学机关进行工作。
    1956年，全国共有四百九十六个工业和建设科学研究所，其中约有四万五千名科学工作者。在科学研究所的总数中，有40％集中在莫斯科和莫斯科省，分属于四十多个部和主管机关。化学工业部仅在莫斯科一地就有十五个科学研究所，而石油工业部在莫斯科则有七个研究所。在列宁格勒和列宁格勒省，设有七十六个工业和建设科学研究所，其中约有八千五百名科学工作者。
    只在莫斯科和列宁格勒就集中了四分之三以上的工业科学研究所和建设科学研究所的工作人员，但在许多加盟共和国，则感到非常缺乏工业和建设的科学服务干部。这种情况不能认为是正常的。
    为技术进步而斗争的任务，要求苏联科学院、加盟共和国科学院及其研究所和实验室的工作接近生产。
    7、有些同志耽心：如果按地域原则来组织工业和建设的管理工作，把全联盟所属的企业交归加盟共和国管辖，就好像是会削弱我们苏维埃经济发展上的统一的计划原则似的。这当然是不正确的。苏联是由十五个权利平等的苏维埃社会主义共和国组成的国家。苏联的国民经济是根据苏联最高苏维埃所批准
  的统一的国民经济计划来管理的，在这种计划中概括了所有加盟共和国的计划。这个计划把各个加盟共和国、自治共和国、边区和省的利益同社会主义扩大再生产、加强整个苏联国防力量、提高人民物质文化水平的利益结合起来。
    六、提高苏维埃机关、党组织和职工会组织在经济建设方面的作用，更广泛地吸收劳动群众参加生产管理工作
    1、规定进一步改进管理工业和建筑业的组织工作的措施，对于根本改善中央和地方的经济建设的管理形式和方法，有着巨大的意义。要实现这些措施，就要求对党组织、苏维埃机关、经济组织、职工会和共青团的组织进行巨大的组织工作。
    在苏维埃政权的年代里，我国的社会组织在领导经济建设方面积累了最宝贵的经验，目前拥有为数众多的、能够顺利解决发展工业和建设的最复杂问题的高度熟练的干部。在采用新的机构的条件下，这些组织在经济建设、吸收广大的劳动群众参加生产的管理、组织为完成和超额完成国家计划的全民社会主义竞赛等方面的作用，将越来越大。
    2、劳动者代表苏维埃，从工农社会主义国家建立之初，就是真正的人民政权机关。有一百五十万名以上的各级地方苏维埃和最高苏维埃代表，成百万的工人、集体农庄庄员、知识分子——各级苏维埃的各种委员会、常设委员会的成员，执行着劳动人民的意志、选民的委托，在各级苏维埃中进行着巨大的、多方面的活动。列宁曾经说过：我们的革命“通过苏维埃政权唤起了千百万以前对国家建设事业漠不关心的人们积极参加了这一建设事业。”（列宁全集第31卷，第467页，译文引自“经济译丛”1954年第5期第3页）
    目前，正在采取措施，使经济建设的领导接近于生产，在这种条件下共和国、边区、省、市、区各级劳动者代表苏维埃的作用，应当大大提高，而苏维埃的工作，应当更加活跃起来。正如苏共第二十次代表大会的决议中所指出：共产主义建设的巨大任务要求劳动人民进一步提高创造积极性和主动性，要求群众更加广泛地参加国家的管理工作，参加国家的各种组织工作和经济工作。为此必须大力发扬苏维埃民主，坚持不懈地改进中央和地方各级苏维埃机关的工作，加强它们同群众的联系。
  （苏联共产党第二十次代表大会关于苏联共产党中央委员会总结报告的决议，人民出版社，第17页）
    关于工业企业和建设单位完成国家任务的主要工作问题，正确利用一切可能条件和地方资源以提高生产的问题，关心不断提高劳动人民的福利和完成住宅和文化生活建设的计划，发挥经济文化建设各方面的创造主动性，——所有这些重要问题都应当经常成为各级劳动人民代表苏维埃注意的中心问题。
    3、要改组工业和建设的管理工作，就要求对职工会的工作进行根本的改进，提高职工会在经济建设方面的作用。在自己的队伍中团结了四千五百万人的职工会，按照列宁的定义“应当是苏维埃政权之最亲近和最必需的同事，而苏维埃政权，在其全部政治和经济工作上都是由工人阶级底觉悟的先锋队——共产党所领导的。职工会一般地是共产主义底学校，它对于全体工人群众以及全体劳动者说来，又应当是学习管理社会主义工业（尔后也逐渐管理农业）底学校”（“列宁文选两卷集”第2卷，人民出版社第925页）。
    苏联的职工会在我们国家发展的各个阶段上，在社会主义建设方面，在解决各种政治的和经济的任务方面，在吸收劳动人民参加生产管理方面，都起过显著的作用。但是，由于对各个工业企业和建设单位的领导工作，是分散在为数很多的各个部和主管机关之间，因此往往对职工会的工作起着消极的作用。目前，全国有大量的按生产部门划分的专业范围十分狭窄的职工会，机构臃肿，层次重叠，职工会中有给职（专职）工作人员名额过多。职工会的工厂委员会，对于解决改进企业的生产活动的根本任务，往往没有表现出应有的主动性和坚持性，对于劳动定额和劳动组织、工资、安全技术等问题，对于合理化和发明创造的问题，对于住宅建设以及改进工人职员的物资生活条件问题，很少过问。
    按经济行政区将职工会工作实行改组，将会促使职工会组织接近于生产，对于职工会组织吸收劳动者参加管理工作的积极活动，创造了更有利的条件。职工会就有了更多的可能条件更深入到生产计划工作问题中，深入到提高劳动生产率的问题中去，对于企业和建设单位的生产活动给予更积极的影响作用。职工会可以更具体地过问社会主义竞赛问题，开展群众性的发明创造和合理化运动的问题，监督执行集体合同中所提出的保证，监督执行工人集会、工人职员生产会议、技术会议、企业和机关劳动者的经济积极分子大会上所通过的决议，此外，还可以更具体地处理改善工人职员劳动条件和生活条件的问题。
    由于要改变工业和建设的管理机构，很显然地，也就要求将职工会进行合并，因此就有可能改进共和国、边区和省各级职工会机关的工作，克服领导机关层次重叠的现象，裁减有给职（专职）人员名额，广泛发扬职工会组织中的独创精神。
    4、在经济建设中占着重要地位的就是列宁共产主义青年团，我们光荣的苏维埃青年，他们在社会主义建设的各个部门中作出了宝贵的贡献。共青团组织和青年，经常表现了主动精神和首倡精神，在解决最巨大的全国性任务方面，在建设工业中心和工业企业方面，在开垦荒地方面，都做出了劳动英雄主义的榜样。在现代条件下，共青团员和青年面前展示着新的发展前途，可以更好地发挥青年在经济建设中的创造主动性，帮助党组织、苏维埃机关和经济组织改进企业和建设单位的工作，开展天然财富以便综合地发展经济，特别是在我国东部地区，给国民经济所有各部门培养熟练干部并从青年工人和专家中选拔出有才干的组织者和领导者到各个工业和建设单位的工作岗位上去。
    5、苏维埃社会主义国家发展四十年的最丰富经验证明，我们国家所达到的具有全世界历史意义的成就，乃是共产党在实现旨在全力发展国家经济及其主要基础——重工业，巩固苏维埃祖国的实力和不断提高人民福利的列宁总路线方面，进行巨大组织工作所取得的成果。按地区原则对经济领导实行改组，将无限地提高共和国、边区和省各级党机关，所有的党组织在发展每个经济行政区的生产和建设方面的责任感，要求党组织更加深入到工业和建筑业的经济问题中去，有效地和具体地领导工业企业和建设单位，加强自己在群众中的组织工作。
    在现行的领导形式条件下，计划的制定和实现都是通过各个专业部、主管机关，地方的党组织往往没有可能对企业的工作起更积极的影响作用，更充分地利用每个地区和每个省的经济潜力，克服有害的主管系统上的隔阂，更广泛地开展一个区、省、边区、共和国范围内企业的生产协作。
    对工业和建设的新的管理形式，将给共和国、边区和省的各级党组织更多的职权和可能条件来影响国家计划的执行进程，影响企业和建设单位的生产活动。来贯彻党和政府有关发展经济和不断提高劳动人民生活水平的决议。
            ×××
    伟大十月社会主义革命给我们人民开辟了根据新的社会主义原则改造国家的广阔道路。列宁认为党在革命胜利后所面临的主要任务就是：大力发展全国所有的生产力，并在这一基础上提高人民的物质福利。列宁曾说我们拥有为建设真正强大的富裕的社会主义共和国所需要的一切：无穷无尽的天然财富、广大的人力资源、无限丰富的人民创造力。
    我国国民经济的高速度发展和人民物质福利的不断增长之所以得到保障，是由于党一贯实行优先发展重工业的列宁的方针的结果。轻工业、农业以及其他国民经济部门，只有在强大的、日益增长的重工业的基础上，才能顺利发展。
    为了生产丰富的食品、鞋类、衣着和其他日常生活用品，为了建设住宅、医院、诊疗所、学校、幼儿园和托儿所，必须首先要有轻工业企业用的设备、要有金属、煤炭、石油、电力、水泥以及其他建筑材料。此外，还必须要有必需数量的农业机器和农业使用的矿质肥料。上述这一切只有重工业才提供，也只有它才能提供。因此，决不允许过分简单地解释重工业和轻工业的作用和相互关系，将这些部门有害地对立起来，党一向认为这种理解和看法，就是对马克思列宁主义原理的歪曲。
    只有在全面发展和高度发展“甲”部类工业部门即重工业——冶金业、燃料工业、动力、机器制造、化学——的条件下，才给发展轻工业和农业所有部门创造必需的条件。如果不这样做，如果接受不正确的、似是而非的见解，并把主要资金用于发展“乙”类工业各部门，即轻工业各部门，只能得到一些表面成绩，只能够在短期内满足某些需要，但是这样将会破坏今后我国经济发展的基础。决不允许这样做，因为这将意味着背离唯一正确的列宁路线，并注定国家经济要走向停滞。
    所以，今后也必须坚决沿着优先发展重工业的道路——已经为苏联的全部发展进程所检验过的道路——前进。当然，决不能将事情弄到荒谬的地步，也决不能忽视发展轻工业而片面地发展重工业，如果这样，就必然会造成国民经济发展方面的困难，阻碍人民生活水平的进一步提高。必须合理地分配基本建设投资，以期重工业和轻工业不论何时都保持正确比例关系。
    正如苏共第二十次代表大会重新强调指出，我们国家面临的任务是：在按人口计算的产量方面赶上并超过最发达的资本主义国家。但是这些国家也并不是停留不前的，而是在一定的条件下向前发展的。要在按人口计算的产量方面赶上并超过最发达的资本主义国家，就必须保证对“甲”部类和“乙”部类的基建投资的正确比例，保证优先发展重工业。
    发展了重工业，就更容易实现生产的全盘机械化和自动化，这样就有可能大力减轻劳动，提高劳动生产率，不断提高苏联人民的生活水平。
    优先发展重工业的路线还可以保证用先进技术装备国民经济，可以高度保持苏联的国防力量。正因为如此，苏联的敌人过去和现在都一贯致力于毁谤这一伟大的列宁的思想，因为这个思想是苏联共产党的总路线。
    我们的党过去、现在和将来都坚持这个经过苏联、伟大的中国和各人民民主国家多年经验所考验的列宁的社会主义发展道路。
    只有这条道路能引导我们走到神圣的目标：建成共产主义社会。因为只有到了共产主义社会，人们在劳动和生活中的一切需要才能得到满足。
    每当在国家的生活中有必要进行根本的改革时，每当发生重大的事件时，苏联共产党总是要和我国广泛的劳动群众商量、和人民商量的。这也是很自然的事，因为共产党的全部活动都是和苏联人民的生活密不可分的，同时党除了人民的利益，除了关心人民的福利和幸福之外，没有也不可能有任何旁的利益。这一次，当根本改组工业和建设的领导的必要性已经成熟时，党又来和人民商量，并将建议提交全民讨论。实现这些建议就能给全面发展我们社会主义的祖国提供新的可能条件和无限宽广的前途。
    苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议，在公布这一提纲时，号召苏联的全体劳动者积极参加讨论和研究关于改组工业和建设的管理的建议，以便在这件巨大的和极重要的事情上找到最正确的途径。
    苏联人民是自己国家的全权的和唯一的主人。凡是在我们土地上所建设的一切，这都是人民的创造性劳动和创造天才的结晶。人民的劳动、人民的觉悟、人民的智慧，就是我国在走向光明的未来——共产主义——前进的道路上取得节节胜利的力量泉源。　（新华社）
