Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 11th: The Czechoslovak government delegation, led by Prime Minister Viliam Široký, returned to Prague by plane on the afternoon of April 10th after visiting the four Asian fraternal countries of China, Vietnam, North Korea, and Mongolia.

In a speech at the airport, Prime Minister Široký conveyed the congratulations of the hundreds of millions of people of the countries visited by the delegation to the Czechoslovak people. He said that the delegation was deeply impressed by the people of these countries' love for the Soviet Union, their firm loyalty to the unity of the socialist camp, their support for the struggle of all peoples for peace, friendship, and coexistence, and their determination to resolutely combat the aggressive plans and conspiracies of international imperialism. This unity and firm attitude of hundreds of millions of people contains a huge and invincible force, and this force is a reliable guarantee for the victory of our common just cause.

Široký praised the Chinese people's rock-solid unity with the Chinese Communist Party and the government, their optimism, and their infinite confidence in their leadership and their happy future. He said that in China, we can feel that the common rhythm of the hearts of hundreds of millions of people is precisely the pulse of human history, and the inevitable development of all countries toward the victory of socialism lies in this irresistible advance of hundreds of millions of people.

He concluded by saying that Czechoslovakia has never had so many sincere and loyal friends in its history. This is a great honor for the Czechoslovak people, and also a great obligation: to move forward more resolutely and more effectively along the time-tested Leninist road, loyal to the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.
