    Pyramid Night Moon
    Yang Shuo
    I heard from an Egyptian friend that the night moon over the pyramids is hazy, like a fantastical dream. I went, not to seek dreams, but to personally touch the living history of this nation.
    During the day, there are many tourists and varied interests. Some like to ride Arabian camels adorned with fancy saddles, circling the pyramids and the Sphinx; others are willing to spend a few coins to watch agile Egyptians swiftly climb up and down the 450-foot-high pyramid in less than ten minutes. All these sights are lively, but not as captivating as the pyramids at night.
    On the night I went, I arrived at an inauspicious time; it was pitch black, and there was no sign of the moon. The pyramid seemed to have melted into the deep, dense night, and only when I got close could I make out its outline. The pyramid is built of large stones, each more than a fathom long. Climbing up a few layers along the stones, looking out at the lights of Cairo's night market in the distance, I couldn't help but feel a sense of茫茫 (máng máng - vast, uncertain) emotion. I had also come during the day and crawled into the pyramid, climbing upwards along a stone corridor, straight into the heart of the pyramid, which was where the sarcophagus of the Egyptian king "Pharaoh" was placed. The empty coffin still exists, but it is already broken and incomplete. Tonight, I climbed the pyramid and carefully touched the large stones stained with the sweat of the ancient Egyptians, and I couldn't help but exclaim in admiration from the bottom of my heart. Just imagine, more than five thousand years ago, what kind of supernatural craftsmanship did the Egyptian people use to create such a wonder of ancient and modern times? For a moment, I felt that the pyramid did not contain the sarcophagus of a "Pharaoh," but the infinitely amazing wisdom of the Egyptian people; the pyramid was not the tomb of a "Pharaoh," but the embodiment of the spirit of this nation.
    The night wind blew from the depths of the desert, slightly cool. Fortunately, there is a quiet garden in front of the pyramid, with clean seats set up outdoors, selling tea and water. I invited several friends who came with me to go in and order a few cups of Turkish hot coffee, drinking and talking. In the lamplight, I saw several stone statues scattered around. I went up to one and looked at it carefully. It was antique and I guessed it was a statue of an ancient emperor, so I smiled and asked, patting the statue's shoulder, "How old are you?"
    The Egyptian friend responded with a smile from the side, "Three thousand years old."
    I touched another statue and asked, "What about you?"
    The Egyptian friend said, "I'm still young, only a thousand years old."
    I laughed: "Good, you can all be regarded as witnesses to Egyptian history at this age."
    The Egyptian friend said: "If we are talking about witnesses, we should first recommend Mr. Sphinx, five thousand years old, what hasn't he experienced?"
    A burst of unrestrained laughter came from the side. Only then did we notice a few white people sitting in a glass house, drinking around a table, gesticulating wildly, all a little drunk.
    The Egyptian friend deliberately coughed twice and quietly said to me, "They are all American businessmen."
    I asked, "What kind of business are they doing?"
    The Egyptian friend pouted and said, "Sooner or later they will be selling atomic bombs!"
    I couldn't help but think of the joke that the Soviet playwright Sofronov often told. Someone used an atomic bomb to make a jar of wine and gave it to people to drink. A Briton took a sip, and with a bang, he disappeared. An American took a sip and immediately turned into a lump of coal. When it came to the Soviet, he took a sip, smacked his lips, and then shook his head and said, "Hey, water was added."
    So I asked, "Do you think an atomic bomb can destroy the pyramids?"
    The Japanese friend, who had suffered from the atomic bomb, replied, "How can it not? Everything will be over in an instant."
    Just as I said this, someone shouted, "The moon is up."
    A very large moon, neither red nor yellow, but unfortunately a little bit missing, not knowing when it crawled out from the horizon. So we went to walk under the moonlight.
    As soon as the moon appeared, the stars scattered across the sky. The nearby pyramids emerged from the night, set against the dark blue sky, appearing solemn and peaceful. Looking into the distance at the Libyan desert, shrouded in moonlight, misty and quiet, there wasn't a single bit of noise, only two or three points of night fire, faintly shining. In a trance, I felt as if I had walked into Egypt's ancient history, and before me was a desolate desert from centuries ago.
    And the Sphinx, staring at Egyptian history, was lying in front of me. In the moonlight, this more than 180-foot-long human-faced lion appeared so quiet and docile. It is said that the expression on its face is particularly mysterious, forever an unfathomable mystery. Over the ages, what unspeakable secrets does it hold?
    Suddenly someone behind me gently asked, "What are you looking at?"
    I turned around and found two Egyptians, who had come to my side at some point. One was very old, dragging a flowered robe; the other was black and fat, with green fire flashing in his eyes, scrutinizing me closely. As soon as he recognized my features, the black fat man quickly said, "Are you from Zhou Enlai? Look, look. We are guards, afraid that someone will cause damage at night."
    The old guard in the flowered robe also interjected softly, "Don't worry, we have to guard against someone causing damage. Over so many years, the Sphinx has suffered more hardships than anyone else. Don't you see its nose? It's injured. When Napoleon's army occupied Egypt, they said that the Sphinx's face was intentionally challenging them, so they opened fire. Later, foreign tourists often took stones from its body to take away, saying that it would bring good luck. You don't know, the Sphinx can even cry. My father told me. It was also a moonlit night, and my father came back late from the market and suddenly found the Sphinx's eyes shining. He took a closer look and found that they were filled with tears. Some people say it was dew. Whatever. Anyway, if the Sphinx had a heart, seeing the suffering that the Egyptians have endured, it should shed tears."
    I asked, "Was your father also a guard?"
    The old guard said, "From my grandfather onwards, we have been guarding this thing for a total of one hundred and twenty years."
    "Will your son continue to guard it?"
    The old guard turned his face away, facing the moonlight, his eyes seemed to be shining, then he swallowed and said, "My son is no longer guarding this, he has gone to guard the motherland."
    A group of black shadows walked down from a high slope, laughing and singing. The old guard said, "I'll go take a look," and walked away.
    The black fat man whispered in my ear, "Don't ask him about this anymore. His son has already died in the battle of Port Said, and he knows it, but he never admits that his son is dead, he just pretends that his son is still alive…"
    The black fat man stopped abruptly, coughed again, reminding me that the old guard had returned.
    The old guard muttered, "No need to make a fuss, do you think I can't guess what you're saying?" He then looked at me and said, "In ancient times, Egyptians believed in the future the most, believing that life began after death, so some coffins were painted with eyes, so that they could look at the world from the coffin. Now no one believes in this anymore. But there is a kind of person who dies with value, and people remember him after death, and his death is a true life."
    The group of black shadows coming down from the high slope were swaying, wanting to approach the Sphinx. The old guard said angrily, "Those American drunkards! Watch them, don't let them destroy anything." The black fat man responded and walked over.
    I thought of something and deliberately asked, "Do you think an atomic bomb can destroy Egyptian history?"
    The old guard glared at me, then smiled and said, "What? Is there anything that can destroy history?"
    I smiled at the Japanese friend and said, "That's right. An atomic bomb cannot destroy Egyptian history, and it can never destroy the pyramids."
    The old guard ignored these things, pointed at the Sphinx and said to me, "If you want to see it, take a closer look. Carved from a whole piece of stone, amazing."
    I then asked, "It is said that the Sphinx's face contains a riddle, what is the riddle?"
    The old guard pretended not to hear, and gesticulated, "Look again: it faces east, for five thousand years, it has been looking forward to the sunrise every day."
    These words were like a curtain hook, gently lifting the curtain that was covering my eyes. I looked at the Sphinx again, and the expression on its face was not at all mysterious, it was just eagerly looking forward to something. What it was looking forward to was the sunrise in the East. This sunrise has already shone on Egyptian history.

    金字塔夜月
    杨朔
    听埃及朋友说，金字塔的夜月，朦朦胧胧的，仿佛是富有幻想的梦境。我去，却不是为的寻梦，倒想亲自多摸摸这个民族的活生生的历史。
    白天里，游客多，趣味也杂。有人喜欢骑上备着花鞍子的阿拉伯骆驼，绕着金字塔和人面狮身的司芬克斯大石像转一转；也有人愿意花费几个钱，看那矫健的埃及人能不出十分钟嗖嗖爬上爬下四百五十呎高的金字塔。这种种风光，热闹自然热闹，但总不及夜晚的金字塔来得迷人。
    我去的那晚上，乍一到，未免不巧，黑沉沉的，竟不见月亮的消息。金字塔仿佛溶化了似的，溶到又深又浓的夜色里去，临到跟前才能看清轮廓。塔身全是一庹多长的大石头垒起来的。顺着石头爬上几层，远远眺望着灯火点点的开罗夜市，不觉引起我一种茫茫的情思。白天我也曾来过，还钻进塔里，顺着一条石廊往上爬，直钻进半腰的塔心里去，那儿就是当年放埃及王“法老”石棺的所在。空棺犹存，却早已残缺不堪。今夜我攀上金字塔，细细抚摸那沾着古埃及人民汗渍的大石头，不能不从内心发出连连的惊叹。试想想，五千多年前，埃及人民究竟用什么鬼斧神工，创造出这样一座古今奇迹？我一时觉得：金字塔里藏的不是什么“法老”的石棺，却是埃及人民无限惊人的智慧；金字塔也不是什么“法老”的陵墓，却是这个民族精神的化身。
    晚风从沙漠深处吹来，微微有点凉。幸好金字塔前有座幽静的花园，露天摆着些干净座位，卖茶卖水。我约会几位同去的朋友进去叫了几杯土耳其热咖啡，喝着，一面谈心。灯影里，照见四处散立着好几尊石像。我凑到一尊跟前细瞅了瞅，古色古香的，猜想是古帝王的刻像，便抚着石像的肩膀笑问道：“你多大年纪啦？”
    那位埃及朋友从一旁笑应道：“三千岁啦。”
    我抚摸着另一尊石像问：“你呢？”
    埃及朋友说：“我还年青，才一千岁。”
    我笑起来：“好啊，你们这把年纪，好歹都可以算做埃及历史的见证人。”
    埃及朋友说：“要论见证人，首先该推司芬克斯先生，五千年了，什么没经历过？”
    旁边传来一阵放浪的笑声。这时我们才留意到在一所玻璃房子里坐着几个白种人，正围着桌子喝酒，张牙舞爪的，都有点醉意。
    埃及朋友故意干咳两声，悄悄对我说：“都是些美国商人。”
    我问道：“做什么买卖的？”
    埃及朋友一瘪嘴说：“左右不过是贩卖原子弹的！”
    我不觉想起苏联剧作家索弗朗诺夫惯说的笑话。有人用原子弹造了缸酒，拿给人喝。英国人一沾唇，一声爆炸，忽地不见影了。美国人才喝一口，立刻化成块煤。轮到苏联人，他喝了口，咂咂嘴，然后摇摇头说：“哎，掺了冷水啦。”
    于是我问道：“你们说原子弹能不能毁了金字塔？”
    同游的日本朋友吃过原子弹的亏，应道：“怎么不能？一下子什么都完了。”
    话刚说到这儿，有人喊：“月亮上来了。”
    好大的一轮，颜色不红不黄的，可惜缺了点边儿，不知几时从天边爬出来。我们就去踏月。
    月亮一露面，满天的星星惊散了。远近几座金字塔都从夜色里透出来，背衬着暗蓝色的天空，显得又庄严，又平静。往远处一望那利比亚沙漠，笼着月色，雾茫茫的，好静啊，听不见一星半点动静，只有三两点夜火，隐隐约约闪着亮光。一恍惚，我觉得自己好像走进埃及远古的历史里去，眼前正是一片世纪前的荒漠。
    而那个凝视着埃及历史的司芬克斯正卧在我的面前。月亮地里，这个一百八十多呎长的人面狮身大物件显得那么安静，又那么驯熟。都说，它脸上的表情特别神秘，永远是个猜不透的谜。天荒地老，它究竟藏着什么难言的心事呢？
    背后忽然有人轻轻问：“你看什么啊？”
    我一回头，发现有两个埃及人，不知几时来到我的身边。一个年纪很老了，拖着件花袍子；另一个又黑又胖，两只眼睛闪着绿火，紧端量我。一辨清我的眉目，黑胖子赶紧说：“是周恩来的人么？看吧，看吧。我们都是看守，怕晚间有人破坏。”
    拖花袍子的老看守也接口轻轻说：“你别多心，是得防备有人破坏啊。这许许多多年，司芬克斯受的磨难，比什么人不深？你不见它的鼻子么？受伤了。当年拿破仑的军队侵占埃及后，说司芬克斯的脸神是有意向他们挑战，就开了枪。再后来，也常有外国游客，从它身上砸点石头带走，说是可以有好运道。你不知道，司芬克斯还会哭呢。是我父亲告诉我的。也是个有月亮的晚上，我父亲从市上回来的晚，忽然发现司芬克斯的眼睛发亮，就近一瞧，原来含着泪呢。也有人说含的是露水。管他呢。反正司芬克斯要是有心，看见埃及人受的苦楚这样深，也应该落泪的。”
    我就问：“你父亲也是看守么？”
    老看守说：“从我祖父起，就守卫着这物件，前后有一百二十年了。”
      “你儿子还要守卫下去吧？”
    老看守转过脸去，迎着月光，眼睛好像有点发亮，接着咽口唾沫说：“我儿子不再守卫这个，他守卫祖国去了。”
    旁边一个高坡上影影绰绰走下一群黑影来，又笑又唱。老看守说：“我看看去，”便走了。
    黑胖子对着我的耳朵悄悄说：“别再问他这个。他儿子已经在塞得港的战斗里牺牲了，他也知道，可是从来不肯说儿子死了，只当儿子还活着。……”
    黑胖子话没说完，一下子停住，又咳嗽一声，提醒我老看守已经回来。
    老看守嘟嘟囔囔说：“不用弄神弄鬼的，你当我猜不到你讲什么？”又望着我说：“古时候，埃及人最相信未来，认为人死后，才是生命的开始，所以有的棺材上画着眼睛，可以从棺材里望着世界。于今谁都不会相信这个。不过有一种人，死得有价值，死后人都记着他，他的死倒是真生。”
    高坡上下来的那群黑影摇摇晃晃的，要往司芬克斯跟前凑。老看守含着怒气说：“这伙美国醉鬼！看着他们，别教他们破坏什么。”黑胖子便应声走过去。
    我想起什么，故意问道：“你说原子弹能不能破坏埃及的历史？”
    老看守瞪了我一眼，接着笑笑说：“什么？还有东西能破坏历史么？”
    我便对日本朋友笑着说：“对了。原子弹毁不了埃及的历史，就永远也毁不了金字塔。”
    老看守也不理会这些，指着司芬克斯对我说：“想看，再细看看吧。一整块大石头刻出来的，了不起呀。”
    我便问道：“都说司芬克斯的脸上含着个谜语，到底是什么谜呢？”
    老看守却像没听见，紧自比手划脚说：“你再看：它面向东方，五千年了，天天期待着日出。”
    这几句话好像一把帘钩，轻轻挂起遮在我眼前的帘幕。我再望望司芬克斯，那脸上的神情实在一点都不神秘，只是在殷切地期待着什么。它期待的正是东方的日出。这日出是已经照到埃及的历史上了。
