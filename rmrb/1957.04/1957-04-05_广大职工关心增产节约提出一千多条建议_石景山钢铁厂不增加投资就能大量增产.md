Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd: Xinhua News Agency reporter Ren Jiaji reports: Workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant recently decided that, without increasing investment, they will increase production for the country this year by more than 15,000 tons of pig iron, more than 5,000 tons of coke, and 2,300 tons of cast iron pipes, and contribute an additional 4.9 million yuan in profits to the state.

This year, the quality of the main raw materials for the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has declined, the variety is complex, and the prices have increased. The silicon content of iron ore has increased, and the production area is far away; the ash content of coking coal is relatively high and unstable. All of these increase production costs and affect the increase in output. In response to these difficulties, all the workers in the plant put forward more than 1,800 suggestions related to increasing production and practicing economy when discussing the national plan this year. These suggestions are basically able to greatly increase production and practice economy without spending money or spending very little money. Increasing the production of sintered ore is the main factor in increasing the production of pig iron this year. If all 100 suggestions put forward by the workers in the raw material sintering section of the iron smelting workshop are implemented, it will increase the production of 32,000 tons of sintered ore. The four suggestions being implemented in the quarrying workshop, including repairing semi-finished product storage yards, improving light turnout switches, implementing cyclical mining, and improving labor organization, will not cost the country a penny and can increase the production of 6,500 tons of limestone this year. After the workers in the coal washing workshop proposed suggestions for adjusting the air and water supply and adjusting the rolling plate according to the quality and size of raw coal, they actively conducted more than 50 experiments and have now achieved success. This one item alone can save more than 30,000 tons of coking coal.

Before discussing the national plan, the factory leaders conducted education on running the enterprise diligently and thriftily to the workers. The plant and various workshops also adopted the method of improving while discussing the problems and suggestions put forward by the workers during the discussion, encouraging the enthusiasm of the workers.

    广大职工关心增产节约提出一千多条建议
    石景山钢铁厂不增加投资就能大量增产
    新华社3日讯　新华社记者任家骥报道：石景山钢铁厂职工最近决定在不增加投资的条件下，今年要为国家增产一万五千多吨生铁、五千多吨焦炭、二千三百吨铸铁管，并给国家多缴四百九十多万元的利润。
    石景山钢铁厂今年主要生产原料质量下降，品种复杂，价格增高。铁矿石含矽量增大，产地远；炼焦煤炭灰分较高，而且不稳定。这些都使生产成本增大，并且影响到产量的提高。针对着这些困难，全厂职工在讨论今年国家计划的时候，提出了一千八百多条有关增产节约的建议。这些建议基本上都是不花钱或者花很少的钱就能大大增产节约的。增产烧结矿是今年增产生铁的主要因素，炼铁车间原料烧结工段职工提出的一百条建议如果全部实现，就能增产三万二千吨烧结矿。采石车间正在实施中的修理半成品存料场、改进轻便道岔、实行循环开采和改进劳动组织等四项建议，不花国家一文钱，今年就可增产六千五百吨石灰石。洗煤车间职工提出根据原煤质量、块度，调配风水、调节轧板的建议后，积极进行了五十多次试验，现已获得成功，只这一项就可少用三万多吨炼焦煤。
    在讨论国家计划以前，工厂领导上向职工进行了勤俭办企业的教育，职工在讨论中提出的问题和建议，厂部及各车间也都采取边讨论边改进的办法，鼓励职工的积极性。
