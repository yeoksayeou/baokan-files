Cadres Sent to the Countryside Go Deep Among the Masses to Lead Production
    New Atmosphere Appears in Shouyang County's Rural Areas

    (Our dispatch) The CCP Shouyang County Committee of Shanxi Province, in accordance with the spirit of streamlining institutions and strengthening the grassroots, has transferred one hundred and fifty-six cadres with rural work experience from county-level organs to serve as township-level party and government leaders.

    After arriving at their new posts, these cadres dispatched to the townships demonstrated the fine style of hard work, plain living, and "sharing weal and woe" with the masses. Zhang Ronghai, the former head of the County Civil Affairs Section, visited farmers in the "New Life" Agricultural Cooperative on the second day of arriving in Zong'ai Township. Through this visit, he learned that the houses of twelve poor farmers in the cooperative were not sturdy enough, and promptly suggested that the agricultural cooperative organize eighteen carpenters to help them repair their homes. Han Zhengping, the former deputy director of the County Party Committee Office, helped all five agricultural cooperatives in Tai'ansi Township learn and promote the advanced farming methods of the Qianjin Agricultural Cooperative in Chengguan Township, Xiangyuan County, Shanxi Province. An Chunzhu and Hu Peizhang were assigned to work in a remote mountainous township. They spent the whole day working with the cooperative members on the river management project, and in the evening, they discussed work and studied the instructions and policies of the higher-level Party committee with the cooperative cadres.

    Because the cadres went to the countryside and truly integrated with the masses of farmers, a new atmosphere has emerged in the county's rural areas. According to a survey of twelve townships, including Zong'ai and Pingtou, 92% of the male labor force and 47% of the female labor force have been actively engaged in spring plowing work, such as accumulating fertilizer, delivering manure, opening canals, digging wells, repairing land, inspecting farm tools, plowing, and sowing. Some cooperative members said happily: "As long as someone leads us, we can work well, and a bumper harvest will surely be achieved this year."

    下乡干部深入群众领导生产
    寿阳县农村出现新气象
    本报讯　中共山西寿阳县委根据精简机构，充实下层的精神，从县级机关抽调出一百五十六个有农村工作经验的干部，下放到各乡，担任乡级党政领导职务。
    这批被派到乡里工作的干部到了新的工作岗位以后，表现出艰苦朴素，和群众“同甘共苦”的优良作风。原县民政科长张荣海同志，刚到宗艾乡的第二天深入到“新生”农业社访问农民。通过这次访问使他了解到该社有十二户贫苦农民的房子不够坚固，及时建议农业社组织了十八个木匠，帮助他们进行了整修。原任县委办公室副主任韩政萍，到了太安驷乡以后，帮助全乡五个农业社学习推广了山西省襄垣县城关乡前进农业社的先进耕作方法。安春柱、胡佩章二同志是这次被分配到偏僻山区的一个乡里工作的，他俩整天在农业社的治河工程上，和社员们一起劳动，晚上还和社务干部们研究工作、学习上级党委的指示和各项政策。
    由于干部们下乡以后，和农民群众真正打成了一片，目前在全县农村中出现了一片新气象。根据宗艾、平头等十二个乡的调查，已经有92％的男劳力和47％的女劳力紧张地投入了积肥送粪、开渠打井、修整土地、检查农具、翻地播种等春耕工作。有的社员高兴的说：“只要有人来领导，咱们能好好的劳动，今年大丰收一定能够实现。”
