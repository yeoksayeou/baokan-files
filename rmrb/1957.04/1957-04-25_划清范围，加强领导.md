    Delineate the Scope, Strengthen Leadership
    Xing Qiyi, Professor of Chemistry Department, Peking University

    Party members should live closely with non-Party intellectuals and gradually improve their thinking through small, everyday work.

    Regarding the issue of Party leadership in natural sciences, I believe that the formulation of major policies for the development of science should be treated separately from the actual leadership of scientific work. The former involves, based on the current needs of national economic construction and the existing human and material resources, pointing out the direction for the future development of science; this work can only be led by the Party and the government. On the other hand, due to the professional nature of each scientific discipline, the specific work scope and research methods of various sciences need to be planned by personnel who possess technical and scientific knowledge. This division of labor is very necessary. Regardless of whether the person executing the specific task is a Party member or not, they must follow the established policy and carry out their work under the leadership of the Party. If this understanding is not wrong, then there is no fundamental question of whether the Party can lead science. This idea is very representative, and a large proportion of scientific workers think this way. Therefore, raising the question of whether the Party can lead science should not be treated as a matter of principle. The question arises only because some minor issues have occurred in specific work, hindering its progress. Now, I will cite a few things to illustrate this point.

    Problems arise when the Party's leadership exceeds its proper scope. I heard that an old teacher was guiding a young Party member in their work, giving them a topic to work on. The Party member then brought this topic to the Party group meeting for discussion, to see if it had research value. This approach created a very bad impact. Also, natural science research work requires quiet, patience, and long-term dedicated study to be effective. However, some leaders have overlooked this characteristic of natural science work, rigidly equating scientific work with other production work, creating a set of forms, and stipulating deadlines and regular reports. Little do they know that the progress of scientific work should be monitored by scientific workers themselves. Because these actions of the leaders exceeded the scope they should be leading, it is natural that this caused adverse results. In the past year, since the Party put forward the slogan of marching toward science, Chinese scientific workers have been greatly encouraged. However, on the other hand, the leadership exceeding its authority has caused disunity among some new and old teachers, making scientific workers very nervous, resulting in half the effort for twice the result, and not much achievement.

    Improve the secrecy system. Secrecy is a necessary measure, and no one doubts that. However, because the boundaries of secrecy are very unclear, some individual leaders often use secrecy as a shield, so the masses have a lot of opinions, which also affects the relationship between the Party and the masses. I once heard a very cultivated old scientist say that he would not do any work that involved secrecy. Although these were angry words, they reflected the fact that unnecessary secrecy has had some adverse effects on work. I suggest that the Party and the government immediately pay attention to this matter and formulate a set of measures, which would be beneficial to the development of scientific work in the future. Inappropriate secrecy measures have not only played a negative role in natural science work, but are also a stumbling block for many other works.

    Scientific workers and leaders should have more contact. Deciding on the direction and plans for scientific work mainly relies on leaders to formulate the most reasonable plans based on the most reliable reports and data. Due to the special circumstances of the past, our Party leaders were originally very unfamiliar with scientific work. Precisely because of this, it is even more necessary to understand the situation in many ways, to have extensive contact with scientific workers, and to exchange views, so that the plans formulated can be more correct and complete. Natural science workers often have a special love for the science they study, and they may not understand other sciences, or they may intentionally or unintentionally underestimate them. This is unavoidable. Therefore, without collecting information from various corners and aspects, it is difficult to have a comprehensive understanding of various sciences. In the past year or two, the leadership's understanding of the actual situation of various sciences has been very different. There are many examples of this.

    In order to do a good job in scientific research, the thinking of natural scientists must be further improved. But in recent years, ideological work seems to have been somewhat relaxed. It is not comprehensive enough to see this phenomenon as intellectuals not actively seeking transformation. Many people are eager to make ideological progress, but suffer from not having good methods. The previous method of listening to large lectures and talking about grand principles, although it played some role, was not very effective. Chairman Mao called on intellectuals to go to the countryside and factories to seek transformation from practice. This is currently the most important thing in ideological work. In the early days of liberation, intellectuals participated in land reform and clarified the boundaries between the enemy and ourselves in practice. Because this practice was not continued, some intellectuals' old ideas resurfaced, so the voice of the landlords once again became popular among intellectuals. In order to enable intellectuals to continue to progress ideologically, Party members should live closely with non-Party intellectuals and gradually improve them through small, everyday work, but they should not be impatient. In addition, it is also unrealistic to regard simply asking intellectuals to speak a grand principle as a standard for ideological improvement.

    The several things mentioned above all illustrate that the current issue is not whether the Party can lead science; on the contrary, it is that the Party should delineate the scope of scientific leadership and further concretely strengthen leadership. On the other hand, patriotic natural science workers should also unite around the Party, and faithfully, unreservedly, and without prejudice, put forward specific opinions to the Party, so as to improve the Party's leadership of science, making it beneficial to our socialist construction cause.

### 划清范围，加强领导

    划清范围，加强领导
    北京大学化学系教授  邢其毅
    党员应该密切地同党外知识分子生活在一起，从点滴工作中慢慢地去提高他们的思想。
    关于党领导自然科学的问题，我认为应该把制定发展科学的大政方针和对科学工作的实际领导分别对待。前者是根据目前国家经济建设的需要和现有的人力、物力，指出今后发展科学的方向；这一工作只有依靠党和政府来领导。另一方面，由于各门科学的专业性，各种科学的具体工作范围和研究的方法步骤，则需由掌握技术科学的人员制定计划。这种分工是很必要的，不管执行具体任务的人是不是党员，他必须遵照既定的方针，在党的领导下进行工作。假若这种了解不是错误的，则根本不存在党是否能领导科学这样一个问题。这种想法很有代表性，一大部分科学工作者都是这样想的，因此，目前提出党能否领导科学的问题，不能当作一个原则性的问题对待。这个问题的提出只是因为具体工作中，发生了一些枝节问题，妨碍了工作的开展。现在我举几桩事来说明这个问题。
    党的领导超过领导的范围就会出问题。听说有位老教师指导一位青年党员做工作，给他出了一个题目。这位党员就在党小组会上提出这个题目让大家讨论，看有没有研究价值。这种做法造成很不好的影响。又如自然科学研究工作，需要安静、忍耐和长时间的钻研才能收到效果；但个别领导人，忽略了自然科学工作的这一特点，生硬地把科学工作和其它生产工作等同起来，制出一套表格，并且规定限期完成、定时汇报等等制度。殊不知检查科学工作的进度，应依靠科学工作者自己来做。由于领导者这些作法，超越了他应当领导的范围，自然会造成不良的结果。近一年来，自从党提出向科学进军的口号以后，我国科学工作者受到很大的鼓舞；但另一方面，领导上超越职权，则造成了一部分新老教师的不团结，把科学工作者弄得十分紧张，结果事倍功半，成就不大。
    改进保密制度。保密是一桩必要的措施，任何人都不怀疑；但由于保密界限很不清楚，个别领导人员常把保密当作一个挡箭牌，因此群众很有意见，也影响了党和群众的关系。我曾听到一位很有修养的老科学家说，凡是带有保密性的工作，他一概不做。这虽然是气愤之词，但却反映了不必要的保密对于工作起了一些不良的作用。我建议党和政府马上注意此事，订出一套办法，这对今后科学工作的开展是有利无弊的。不妥当的保密办法不但在自然科学工作中起了不良的作用，对于其它的许多工作都是一块绊脚石。
    科学工作者和领导者应有更多的联系。决定科学工作的方针计划，主要依靠领导者根据最可靠的汇报和数据，制订出最合理的计划。由于以往的特殊环境，我党的领导者对于科学工作本来已十分生疏。唯其如此，则更应当多方面地了解情况，广泛地和科学工作者接触，并交换意见，这样才能使制定的计划更加正确和完整。自然科学工作者，常常是对于自己研究的科学特别爱好，对别人研究的科学或是不太了解，或是有意无意地过低估计，这是难免的事情。因此，不从各个角落多方面搜集资料，对各门科学很难得到全面的了解。在过去的一两年中，领导方面对各门科学实际情况的了解是很有出入的。这方面也有不少的例子。
    为了作好科学研究工作，自然科学家的思想必须进一步提高。但这几年来，思想工作似乎有些松懈。如果把这种现象看成是知识分子不积极要求改造，是不够全面的。很多人渴求思想进步，但苦于没有很好的方法。以往听大课讲大道理的办法，虽起了一些作用，但收效不大。毛主席号召知识分子下乡到工厂去，从实践中求得改造，这是目前思想工作中最重要的事情。解放初期，知识分子参加土地改革，在实践中划清了敌我的界限。由于这种做法没有继续下去，有些知识分子的旧的思想又冒了头，因此地主之音在知识分子中又有了行市。为了使知识分子在思想上继续进步，党员应该密切地和党外知识分子生活在一起，从点滴的工作中，慢慢提高他们，却不可操之过急。另外，只叫知识分子说一篇大道理就当作思想提高的标准，也是不切合实际的。
    上面谈的几桩事情，都说明当前问题不是党能不能领导科学的问题；相反地，而是党应当划清科学领导的范围，更进一步具体地加强领导的问题。另一方面，爱国的自然科学工作者，也应团结在党的周围，忠实地，无保留地，无偏见地向党提出具体意见，从而改进党对科学的领导，使有利于我国社会主义建设事业。
