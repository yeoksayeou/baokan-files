Yunnan Party, government, military and other departments across the board are vigorously supporting a bumper harvest in agricultural production. The Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Committee have successively dispatched more than two hundred cadres to various special districts; all departments in special districts, counties, and cities have also kept only a few people in the offices to take care of daily work, with the rest going down to the countryside to engage in production alongside the farmers; almost all district and township cadres have gone deep into the production teams to help with work.

The troops stationed in Yunnan, in addition to actively publicizing good production to family members and relatives, have also established a system of voluntary labor to support socialism, actively participating in water conservancy projects, fertilizer accumulation, and other work. The Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Provincial Department of Transportation have also required their subordinate units to earnestly do a good job in the transportation and supply of agricultural production materials. Students from Yunnan University and other schools in Kunming are also using Sundays to go to nearby agricultural cooperatives to help with production.

    云南党、政、军等部门
    大力支援农民实现农业大丰收
    本报讯　云南省党、政、军等部门上下一致，大力支援农业生产丰收。中共云南省委和省人民委员会，先后抽调了两百多个干部，分别下到各专区；各专、县、市机关，也都只留少数几人在机关里照顾日常工作，其余的全部下去，并和农民一道搞生产；区、乡干部则几乎是全部深入到生产队里去帮助工作。
    驻守云南的部队，除积极向家属亲友宣传搞好生产外，还建立了支援社会主义的义务劳动制度，积极参加兴修水利、积肥等工作。省供销社和省交通厅，也要求所属单位必须切实做好农业生产资料的运输、供应工作。昆明云南大学等校的学生，亦利用星期日到近郊农业社去帮助生产。
