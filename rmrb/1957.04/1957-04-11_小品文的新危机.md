    New Crisis of the Satirical Essay
    Huichun

    Editor's Note: This article raises some questions about critical satirical essays. There may be various different views on these questions. Our purpose in publishing this article is to stimulate discussion.

    In 1933, Lu Xun pointed out that the satirical essay at that time was facing a crisis of transforming from a weapon for "struggle and combat" into a "small ornament." However, later, through the efforts of Lu Xun himself and the "League of Left-Wing Writers," this crisis was finally overcome, and the satirical essay was maintained as a "dagger" and "javelin" in the "literary revolution and even ideological revolution."

    Leaving aside many problems in the development process of satirical essays in the twenty years since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, I now see that satirical essays are facing a new crisis because many contradictions have not been correctly resolved.

    First, these satirical essays "originally sprouted from the 'literary revolution' and even the 'ideological revolution'," so they are products of an undemocratic era. Now it is an era of socialist democracy; then, is there still a reason for the existence of such satirical essays? This is a fundamental question.

    Second, past satirical essays were mainly aimed at the enemy, so they were "daggers" and "javelins," characterized by their sharpness. Now, if satirical essays still need to exist, then they should mainly be used as medicine to treat illnesses and save people in dealing with internal contradictions among the people. As a medicine, it always seeks to be effective without producing side effects, so it must be moderate and peaceful. However, the diseases in social life are much more complex than those in the human body; and the latter is individual, while the former is often shared by many people with different conditions, so there can be many side effects. And satirical essays are not willing to lose their sharp characteristics. This is another problem.

    Naturally, moderation and peace are not impossible to achieve, as long as all aspects are taken into consideration, and the opinions of all kinds of people are solicited, and dozens of revisions are made. But in this way, the article will inevitably lengthen, and the completion time will inevitably be delayed. However, the satirical essay has set itself the task of reflecting reality quickly in short articles. How to solve this contradiction?

    Third, these satirical essays, like other critical articles, are directed at the matter, not the person. But on the one hand, it is difficult to separate the matter from the person; on the other hand, satirical essays require themselves to have a bit of figurative flavor, which is different from abstract papers. This inevitably touches the skin of specific people. What's more, people are of all kinds, even just cadres, there are different sizes. Looking at the recent trends in newspapers and magazines, the sharpness of satirical essays mostly points to smaller cadres, and rarely touches the ideological style of larger cadres. But the "pride" of satirical essays themselves is very unwilling to only act as penicillin for small cadres. What to do?

    Fourth, comprehensiveness is always necessary, and satirical essays are no exception. But satirical essays, because of their "smallness" and some other characteristics, can only highlight one aspect and imply the other. Many people now have extremely comprehensive requirements for comprehensiveness. For example, opening a map and seeing an arrow drawn on it, marked "North"; people are dissatisfied: there are at least four directions, but now only "North" is indicated, where have East, South, and West gone? Extremely one-sided! This also gives satirical essays a great lesson, but the only way to correct it is: give it up.

    Fifth, everything now requires seriousness and humility, which is certainly correct. But one of the natures of satirical essays is liveliness, and even a bit of playful scolding, which contradicts many people's so-called seriousness and humility. Marx once said, "The humility of genius is to forget humility and immodesty, and to make things themselves stand out"; and "seriousness should mean seriousness towards things." He also said: "To regard the ridiculous as ridiculous is to take a serious attitude towards it; to still take a humble attitude towards immodesty is also the most serious immodesty of the spirit." However, can satirical essays invoke these words to define their own style? According to many people's opinions, it is impossible, what they require of seriousness is being proper, and humility is always being cautious. How should this problem be solved?

    Sixth, satirical essays are also for the broad masses to see, so they also require being popular. What many people now require of being popular is that every word is modernized, every sentence is Beijing-ized, and every citation must be familiar to everyone. However, satirical essays, in order to add a little color to themselves, sometimes inevitably drag in the ancients, involve foreign countries, and add a little knowledge that is not necessarily known to everyone. This is detached from the masses.

    Seventh, it is also heard that there are now many people who can write well who have no material, and people who have material cannot write well. But the editorial department wants both material and good articles. As a result, old writers retire, and new writers cannot emerge. What to do about this?

    In addition, there are many contradictions, so I won't go into them one by one.

    So many contradictions have created a new crisis for satirical essays: the crisis of extinction.

    If it is affirmed that satirical essays still have a reason to exist in today's society, then these contradictions must be resolved correctly. How to solve them? Serious discussion is needed. I personally believe that we should first follow the principle of "correctly handling contradictions among the people," and second, we should achieve what Lu Xun said, "close to the present, and vivid, energetic, beneficial, and also moving."

    To this end, contemporary satirical essay writers must start from scratch, improve themselves in the attitude and method of exploring the truth, preserve good traditions, overcome outdated habits, and make their works always have a bit of life, a bit of thought, and a bit of art, and also a bit of science, and should also have their own style. To the reader, he should pay attention to adapting, but also to improving them, not just accommodating them. Authors and readers should promote each other under mutual influence, so that the vast number of readers who have materials will also slowly learn to write.

    Finally, I also hope that writing satirical essays should also be done quickly, well, and economically.

### 小品文的新危机

    小品文的新危机
    回春
    编者按：这篇文章提出了一些关于批评性小品文的问题。对于这些问题可以有各种不同的见解。我们发表这篇文章的目的，是希望能够引起大家的讨论。
    1933年，鲁迅曾指出了当时的小品文，有从为“挣扎和战斗”的武器，转化为“小摆设”的危机。但后来，经过鲁迅自己和“左翼作家联盟”的努力，终于克服了这危机，把小品文保持为“文学革命以至思想革命”中的“匕首”和“投枪”。
    抗日战争发生以后的二十年来，小品文发展过程中的许多问题，暂且不谈。现在，我看到小品文正面临着一个新的危机，因为它有许多矛盾尚未正确地解决。
    第一，这类小品文“原是萌芽于‘文学革命’以至‘思想革命’的”，所以，它是不民主的时代的产物。现在已经是社会主义民主的时代了；那么，这类小品文是否还有存在的理由呢？这是根本性的问题。
    第二，过去的小品文主要是对敌的，所以是“匕首”和“投枪”，其特点是锋利。现在，小品文倘还有存在的必要，那么，主要地应该作为对待人民内部矛盾的治病救人的药。而药之为药，总是求其有效而不生副作用的，所以必须中正和平。但社会生活中的病，比人体的病复杂得多；而且后者是个体的，前者却往往为许多其他条件不同的人们所共有，所以，副作用可以多得很。而小品文又不大愿意失去自己的锋利的特点。这又是一个问题。
    自然，中正和平并不是不可以做到的，只要面面都关照到，而且征求各色人等的意见，进行几十次的修改。但这样，文章一定会拉长，完成的时间一定会拖迟。而小品文，却给自身规定了用短小的篇幅来迅速地反映现实的任务。怎样解决这个矛盾？
    第三，这类小品文同其他批评文章一样，对事不对人。但一则，事与人是很难分开的；二则，小品文要求自己有点儿形象化的味道，不同于抽象的论文。这就免不了触及具体的人的皮肤。何况，人又有种种，即就干部说，也有大小不同。看近来的报章杂志的趋势，小品文的锋芒大都指向较小的干部，很少接触到大干部的思想作风。但小品文自己的“骄傲”，却很不愿意只给小干部充当盘尼西林。怎么办？
    第四，全面性，总是要的，小品文也不例外。但小品文，还是因为“小”，又由于一些别的特性，它只能突出某一面，而暗示另一面。现在的许多人，对于全面性的要求，却真是全面极了。例如，翻开一张地图，看上面画了一个箭头，标着“北”；人们就不满意了：方向至少有四个，现在只指明“北”，东、南、西到哪里去了？片面之极！这也给小品文很大一个教训，但纠正的办法只有一条：拉倒。
    第五，现在一切要求严肃和谦逊，当然是正确的。但小品文，它的天性之一则是活泼，甚至于要带点儿嬉笑怒骂，这又与许多人的所谓严肃和谦逊发生了矛盾。马克思曾说，“天才的谦逊是要忘掉谦逊和不谦逊，使事物本身突出”；而“严肃的意思应当是对待事物的严肃”。他还说：“把可笑的事物看成是可笑的，这就是对它采取严肃的态度；对不谦逊仍然采取谦逊的态度，这也就是精神的最严肃的不谦逊”。但是，小品文能够援引这些话来规定自己的风格么？照许多人的意见看来，是不能的，他们所要求的严肃是一本正经，谦逊则是一味小心。这个问题又该如何解决？
    第六，小品文也是给广大群众看的，所以也要求通俗，现在许多人所要求的通俗，是字字现代化，句句北京化，而且每一个引证都必须是人人熟悉的。但是，小品文，为了给自己添一点色彩，有时不免要拉扯古人，牵涉外国，而且加一点未必是大家知道的知识进去。这就脱离了群众。
    第七，还听说，现在有许多能写文章的人没有材料，而有材料的人又写不好文章。编辑部却既要有材料，还要文章好。于是，老作家退休，新作家出不来。这又怎么办？
    此外，矛盾还多，不一一去说它了。
    这样的许多矛盾，就造成了小品文的新危机：消亡的危机。
    倘若肯定小品文在今天的社会里还有存在理由，那么，这些矛盾，是必须正确解决的。如何解决？需要认真的讨论。我个人以为，首先应当遵循“正确地处理人民内部矛盾”的原则，其次，要做到鲁迅所说，“和现在的切帖，而且生动，泼刺，有益，而且也能移人情”。
    为此，现在的小品文作者，必须从头学起，在探讨真理的态度和方法方面提高自己，并保存优良的传统，克服过时的积习，使自己的作品总有点儿生活，有点儿思想，还有点儿艺术，也可以有点儿科学，而且，还应当有自己的风格。对于读者，他应当注意适应，但又要提高他们，不是一味的迁就。作者和读者要在相互影响之下，彼此促进，以致拥有材料的广大读者也慢慢地学会了写。
    最后，我还希望写小品文也要做到又快、又好、又省。
