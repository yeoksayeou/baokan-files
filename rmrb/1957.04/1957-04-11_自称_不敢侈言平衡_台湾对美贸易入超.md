Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 10th: Taiwan newspapers report that Kong Shize, the representative of the Chiang Kai-shek group's Taiwan "Central Trust Bureau" stationed in the United States, said that Taiwan's exports to the United States account for only 5% of Taiwan's imports from the United States. That is, the ratio of American goods imported into Taiwan to Taiwanese goods exported to the United States is twenty to one.

Kong Shize made these remarks when he recently returned to Taiwan from the United States. He said that currently, only a handful of Taiwanese products have a market in the United States, such as citronella oil, tea, and pineapples. Taiwan's citronella oil production accounts for about three-quarters of the world's production, and it could have a decisive influence on the supply and price of the international market, "but this favorable factor has been used by American merchants," placing Taiwan's citronella oil producers and exporters in a "controlled position." The price of citronella oil in the New York market is entirely "controlled by a small number of merchants." Taiwan's sugar "has very little hope of being sold to the United States."

In recent years, the United States has been dumping tens of millions of dollars worth of goods into Taiwan every year; while Taiwanese products are controlled and squeezed out of the American market. Kong Shize also lamented that, with such a disparate trade volume, "we dare not extravagantly speak of a balance in US-Taiwan trade."

### 自称“不敢侈言平衡”  台湾对美贸易入超

    自称“不敢侈言平衡”
    台湾对美贸易入超
    新华社广州10日电　台湾报纸报道，蒋介石集团台湾“中央信托局”驻美国代表孔士锷说，台湾对美的输出，仅占台湾自美的输入的5％。即美货输台、台货输美的比例是二十比一。
    孔士锷是最近刚从美国回到台湾时说这番话的。他说，目前台湾产品在美国有市场者只有香茅油、茶叶、凤梨（即菠萝）等寥寥数种。台湾香茅油产量约占世界产量的四分之三，对国际市场的供给与价格，本可具有决定性影响，“但这一项有利因素，反而被美国商人所利用”，置台湾香茅油生产者与出口商于
  “被控制的地位”。纽约市场香茅油价格的高低，完全“操在少数商人手中”。台湾的糖“远销美国的希望极微”。
    几年来美国每年都以数千万美元的物资向台湾倾销；而台湾产品在美国市场却受到控制和排挤。孔士锷也慨叹说，在如此悬殊的贸易额下，“不敢侈言美台贸易平衡”。
