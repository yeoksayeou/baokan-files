Third, Which class's life has improved? Which class's life has deteriorated?

We need to first take a close look at some basic numbers. Among the current 44 well-to-do households, 22 were poor peasants at the time of land reform, 18 were lower-middle peasants, and 4 were well-off middle peasants. Among the current 464 households with a moderate standard of living, 301 were poor and hired peasants at the time of land reform, 125 were lower-middle peasants, 4 were well-off middle peasants, and 34 were landlords and rich peasants. Among the current 77 households in difficulty, 67 were poor and hired peasants at the time of land reform, 6 were middle peasants, and 4 were landlords. Among the current 28 households receiving the "Five Guarantees," 26 were poor and hired peasants at the time of land reform, and 2 were middle peasants.

It is also necessary to read some other numbers. Among the current 44 well-to-do households, 16 were newly emerged lower-middle peasants before cooperativization, 6 were newly emerged upper-middle peasants, 11 were old lower-middle peasants, and 11 were old upper-middle peasants. Among the current 464 households with a moderate standard of living, 140 were poor peasant households before cooperativization, 149 were newly emerged lower-middle peasants, 7 were newly emerged upper-middle peasants, 124 were old lower-middle peasants, 10 were old upper-middle peasants, and 34 were landlords and rich peasants. Among the current 77 households in difficulty, 70 were poor peasants before cooperativization, 2 were newly emerged lower-middle peasants, 1 was an old lower-middle peasant, and 4 were landlords. Among the current 28 households receiving the "Five Guarantees," 26 were poor peasants before cooperativization, and 2 were old lower-middle peasants.

After reading these basic figures, we can analyze the living conditions of each class based on them.

(1) The Changes in the Lives of Poor Peasants: Of the 416 poor and hired peasant households in Longchong Township before the land reform in 1953, 167 had risen to become newly emerged lower-middle peasants and 13 had risen to become newly emerged upper-middle peasants by the end of 1955 before cooperativization. That is to say, 44% of the poor and hired peasants had risen to become middle peasant households and lived a moderate life. After cooperativization, in just one year, another 145 poor peasants were freed from their poor peasant lives and rose to become middle-income households. Now, of the 416 poor and hired peasant households before the land reform, only 97, or a quarter, still live a difficult poor peasant life, and their lives have not fundamentally improved (although most of them are slightly better off). The remaining 319 households have seen significant improvements in their lives and live a moderate or well-to-do life.

The speed at which poor peasants' lives improved was rapid. According to the investigation of three typical old poor peasant households, calculated by the average net income per person per year, it was 47.1 yuan before liberation in 1949, and 69.2 yuan in 1952. After the land reform in 1953, it rose sharply to 86.1 yuan. In 1954 and 1955, due to insufficient grain and a decline in sideline occupations, it fell to 68.7 yuan and 76.2 yuan respectively. After cooperativization in 1956, although a severe drought was encountered, it still rebounded to 80.1 yuan. The average net income per person in 1956 was almost double that of 1949 before liberation.

The old poor peasant households before the land reform who have now jumped to become well-to-do households and those who are still in difficulty are both in the minority.

The main reason why some poor peasants became newly emerged lower-middle peasants and were then able to become well-to-do households is that someone in the family works as a cadre detached from production or as a worker outside, and often sends money back. We investigated three households that had risen from poor peasants to well-to-do households. Their labor remuneration from the cooperative, the family's private plots, income from sideline occupations such as pigs, chickens, and odd jobs, were roughly the same as ordinary middle-income households, and some were even slightly less. However, when remittances from cadres or workers working outside were added, their net income figures were significantly higher than those of other middle-income households.

The 97 old poor peasant households who always live a poor peasant life and have not been able to turn themselves around through land reform and cooperativization have many reasons for their poverty. We investigated 13 such poor peasant households. Among them, 9 were still poor due to high growth rate of children, loss of all or half of the main labor force, and the decline of sideline occupations, and 4 were still poor for other reasons.

(2) The Changes in the Lives of Old Lower-Middle Peasants: The degree of improvement in the lives of the 151 old lower-middle peasants before the land reform was less than that of the poor peasants in recent years. Only 13 had risen to become upper-middle peasants before cooperativization. After one year of cooperativization, another 11 had risen to become well-to-do households, but last year 6 old lower-middle peasants who could have risen to the level of upper-middle peasant life fell back to a moderate standard of living. Since the land reform, a total of 18 households have actually risen. Of the remaining 133 households, except for 3 households that have fallen into difficult households and households receiving the "Five Guarantees," most households' income has increased year by year since liberation, but not enough to reach the level of upper-middle peasant life, and the income of some households is even less than before liberation. According to the investigation of three typical old lower-middle peasant households, their average net income per person was only 57.3 yuan in 1949, increased to 82.2 yuan in 1953, decreased to 62.2 yuan in 1955, and then rebounded to 80.7 yuan in 1956.

The advantage of old lower-middle peasant production over poor peasant production is the active development of sideline occupations such as pig and chicken raising and small-scale business operations. The amount of sideline income has a great impact on their total income. The reason why income was higher in 1953 than in 1955 was mainly because sideline income was higher. The reason why a part of old lower-middle peasants' income is now less than before liberation is also mainly because sideline income has decreased. We investigated 35 old lower-middle peasant households, and their total income is now less than before liberation. Among them, 24 households saw a decrease in income due to the cessation of small businesses, raising fewer pigs and chickens, and an increase in population.

(3) The Changes in the Lives of Well-Off Middle Peasants: Before the land reform, there were a total of 8 well-off middle peasant households in the township. One year before cooperativization, the number of well-off middle peasants (later called upper-middle peasants) increased to 21. After one year of cooperativization, among these 21 new and old upper-middle peasant households, the income of 17 households did not decrease significantly, and they lived a well-to-do life. However, the income of 4 households decreased significantly and fell to a moderate standard of living.

Why did the income of a small number of well-off middle peasants decrease significantly? Village cadres said that it was mainly because exploitation and speculative behavior were eliminated after joining the cooperative, and sideline occupations declined.

(4) The Changes in the Lives of Landlords and Rich Peasants: The lives of all 38 households of the 29 landlords and 9 rich peasants before the land reform have declined. However, their net income has almost increased year by year in recent years. Especially after becoming probationary or formal members of the cooperative in 1956, their net income has increased significantly. Of the 38 landlord and rich peasant households, except for 4 households living in difficulty, the other 34 households now live a moderate life. According to the investigation of two ordinary landlord households, calculated by the average net income per person per year, it was 121.5 yuan before liberation in 1949, decreased to 41.2 yuan after the land reform in 1953, increased to 53.6 yuan in 1954, decreased to 47.8 yuan in 1955, and then increased sharply to 71.4 yuan after one year of cooperativization last year.

In short, after the land reform and cooperativization in Longchong Township, the living standards of most poor and hired peasant households have risen, especially after cooperativization, their lives have improved significantly; the lives of most middle peasant households have also improved, and the lives of a small number of middle peasant households have declined slightly; the one-quarter of old poor peasant households who still live a difficult life have also improved slightly, with the exception of a few; the lives of landlords and rich peasants have declined but have begun to rise again. This is the picture of the changes in the lives of each class in Longchong Township after liberation, and it is also the main conclusion of the investigation.

Fourth, What do the peasants support? What do they criticize?

The peasants had the most opinions about the grain unified purchase and sale in the local 1955 grain year (from the late rice harvest in 1954 to the late rice harvest in 1955). Of the 15 peasant households we interviewed, whether upper-middle peasants, lower-middle peasants, or poor peasants, none of them did not criticize us when the matter was brought up. The only difference was in the different views and the different degrees of displeasure.

Although the grain unified purchase and sale in 1954 also left the peasants with relatively tight rations and fodder grain, the unified sales were relatively loose, and the peasants called it "free unified purchase." In addition, the peasants still had some grain "stockpiles" at this time, so the grain situation in 1954 was still acceptable. However, the grain unified purchase in 1955 was too tight, and the unified sales were also too tight. The peasants' grain "stockpiles" were also empty. The peasants' grain situation became quite tense a few months before the early rice harvest in 1955. The upper-middle peasants, who were used to having ample grain, could not bear it at this time, and their dissatisfaction was the greatest. The lower-middle peasants were dissatisfied that the unified purchase and sale took away their rations, and also complained that their pig and chicken raising sideline occupations were also unified. The poor peasants approved of the unified purchase and sale, saying that the grain supply was guaranteed and the grain price would not fluctuate, but they did not approve of the too-tight unified sales, saying that "rations cannot be bought back."

The poor and lower-middle peasants were satisfied with the unified purchase and sale of grain in 1956, saying "no comments". The grain rations were sufficient. Especially the poor peasants, they said happily: "The Communist Party is still good. The Kuomintang does not admit or correct mistakes, but the Communist Party can admit and correct mistakes." The upper-middle peasants were also satisfied, saying that there was enough food, but they still felt that the rations were not generous enough and that there was not enough fodder.

In the 1957 grain unified purchase and sale year, Longchong Township retained 560 catties of rice (average for adults and children), of which a full laborer retained 700 catties of rice, and children aged one to four years old retained 300 catties of rice each. This amount of rice, plus the more than 100 catties of sweet potatoes and taro that each person received from their private plots last year, was enough for food. We have personally seen the warehouses of more than a dozen peasant households, and we can also see that the food situation is abundant. All the households in difficulty (poor peasant households) and most of the middle-income households (lower-middle peasant households) are very satisfied with the food ration numbers given in 1957. The households in difficulty and a small number of middle-income households are now worried that they do not have enough cash to buy back so much food; some are worried that if they cannot buy it back now, will the food standards be tightened in the future. Only well-to-do households (upper-middle peasants) and a small number of middle-income households with few people still hope for more food.

Are cloth coupons and oil coupons sufficient? Many cadres in the city say that rural areas are only given nineteen feet of cloth coupons per person per year and only five taels of oil coupons per month, which is not enough to wear and eat. Some district and township cadres also follow suit. However, the results of the Longchong Township survey are different from what everyone says.

According to the investigation of 9 typical households, the households in difficulty did not buy an average of one new unlined garment per person last year, and the middle-income households added less than two new unlined garments per person. The households in difficulty ate an average of three taels and two mace of oil per person per month, and the middle-income households ate less than five taels of oil per person per month. The oil coupons issued by the state are sufficient, and the cloth coupons cannot be used up. Middle-income households and households in difficulty have no comments on cloth coupons and oil coupons. The ones who shout that cloth coupons and oil coupons are not enough are mainly well-to-do households. They eat an average of six to seven taels of oil per person per month and make three or four new unlined garments a year. The cloth coupons and oil coupons issued by the state are not enough, so they want to compare with big cities and ask for more oil coupons and cloth coupons.

It is also these well-to-do households who shout that there is less pork and that salted fish is bad.

The households in difficulty among the poor and lower-middle peasants love the cooperative like their own home and urgently demand that the cooperative be run well. They said that the cooperative can resist drought, can reasonably arrange the labor force, and even better: "A poor peasant household, for such a long year, it is difficult to predict what disasters will happen, and there will be a reliance in the cooperative." Most lower-middle peasants admit that the cooperative can resist drought and is better than working alone, but they are easily shaken (especially those old lower-middle peasants). Several old lower-middle peasants with more money on hand said: "In the event of a drought, it is good to run a cooperative; if the weather is good, it is good to work alone."

The upper-middle peasants are the most half-hearted about running cooperatives. However, if they work alone, they are afraid that manpower and animal power will not be able to keep up during busy farming and drought resistance, and even more afraid that the cadres will not know the bottom line of their production, and will buy more grain than they sell, and levy more public grain. They said: "If the cooperative is dissolved, and someone helps me during drought resistance and busy farming, and the cadres can fairly handle the unified purchase and sale and the levy of public grain, then I am willing to work alone. If only one of these two conditions cannot be met, then it is better to join the cooperative." It seems that most of them have an attitude toward running the cooperative: they do not withdraw from the cooperative, earn enough food, but do not have much hope for the cooperative, and put their energy into expanding their family sideline occupations to increase income.

The poor and lower-middle peasants have three opinions on the production of the cooperative last year. First, they dislike the large investment, many miscellaneous expenses, and high costs. Last year, 2,200 yuan was spent on buying water wheels, bulldozers, double-wheel double-share plows, and kerosene, which was almost all wasted. A poor peasant said: "If we are more careful, the price of our one day's work can earn five jiao" (now it is four jiao). Second, they dislike that they are short of cash and say that food is guaranteed, but the pocket money is too little. This was caused by neglecting sideline production in the first half of the year, and it got better later, but its consequences can still be felt now. Third, they dislike that the cooperative cadres listen to the superiors too much and consult with the masses too little. Sometimes the superiors do not know the real situation and put pressure on the tasks one by one, causing a lot of waste. This mainly refers to the winter wheat and winter pea planting. After harvesting the late rice last year, the county and district committees wanted Longchong Township to plant 600 mu of wheat and 1,200 mu of peas, all of which were intended to do good things, but they did not consider the sowing season, fertilizer, manpower arrangement, and the relationship between operating other crops. After the township and cooperative cadres' thinking was straightened out, they did not consult with the masses and rigidly implemented the instructions of the district. Now, the winter peas are not considered to be a loss, but the winter wheat seems difficult to recover even the cost. The co-op members said, "It would have been better if we had listened to us more at that time." An old poor peasant activist said: "There is an issue of superior-subordinate relationship in running the cooperative now. In the future, if the relationship between superiors and subordinates is good, the cooperative is guaranteed to be run well!"

Longchong Township has been liberated for more than seven years. Whether upper-middle peasants, lower-middle peasants, or poor peasants, they all say that the Communist Party's politics has six good points: First, the world is peaceful, there are no planes bombing, no bandits, and no thieves; Second, the social atmosphere is good, and people have become diligent and upright. Opium and gambling, which no dynasty could ban, have been wiped out cleanly in the hands of the Communist Party for several years; Third, water conservancy is good, and water conservancy that could not be done for generations has been done. These three points, including the old upper-middle peasants, applaud in every possible way and praise them as "benevolent government." Fourth, money is valuable. This point satisfies the upper-middle peasants the most; Fifth, land reform is good, and cooperativization is good. Before liberation, six or seven out of ten households had to buy grain to survive the New Year. Now it is reversed, and everyone has food to eat. This point satisfies the poor peasants the most; Sixth, the Communist Party is selfless, knows its mistakes and corrects them.

The peasants say that the Communist Party's politics has two bad points: First, the unified purchase and sale of grain in 1955 was too tight and too dead; Second, now, food is guaranteed, but "there is not enough cash."

When asked, "Has the people's world been settled?" The old poor peasants at the time of land reform replied without thinking: "Ironclad regime!" The old lower-middle peasants hesitated for a moment and followed suit. The old upper-middle peasants said: "The problem is too big to answer."

    龙冲乡农民生活状况调查报告（续昨）
    杜导正　郑世文　刘汉　方静波
    三、哪个阶层生活好了？哪个阶层生活差了？
    这得先细细看一些基本数字。现在的44户富裕户中，有土改时的贫农22户，下中农18户，富裕中农4户。现在的464户中等生活户中，有土改时的贫雇农301户，下中农125户，富裕中农4户，地主、富农34户。现在的77户困难户中，有土改时的贫雇农67户，中农6户，地主4户。现在的28户五保户中，有土改时的贫雇农26户，中农2户。
    还必须再读另一些数字。现在的44户富裕户中，有合作化前的新下中农16户，新上中农6户，老下中农11户，老上中农11户。现在的464户中等生活户中，有合作化前的贫农户140户，新下中农149户，新上中农7户，老下中农124户，老上中农10户，地主富农34户。现在的77户困难户中，有合作化前的贫农70户，新下中农2户，老下中农1户，地主4户。现在的28户五保户中，有合作化前的贫农26户，老下中农2户。
    看完这些基本数字，我们就可以根据它来分析各阶层生活变迁的状况了。
    （一）贫农的生活变迁：龙冲乡1953年土地改革前的416户贫雇农，到合作化前的1955年底时，已经有167户上升为新下中农，13户上升为新上中农。就是说，有44％的贫雇农上升成中农户，过上了中等生活。而经过合作化，时间只一年，便又有145户贫农摆脱了贫农生活，上升为中等户。现在，土改前的416户贫雇农，只有97户，即四分之一还过着困难的贫农生活，生活没有基本地改善（虽然其中大多数也略略好些），其余的319户，生活都有了显著改善，过上了中等或富裕的生活。
    贫农生活上升的速度很快。据三户老贫农典型户的调查，以每年每人平均纯收入计算，解放前的1949年是47.1元，1952年是69.2元。土改后的1953年猛升至86.1元，1954年和1955年因粮食不足副业衰退，分别落到68.7元和76.2元。1956年合作化后，虽遇到大旱仍回升到80.1元。1956年每人平均纯收入几等于解放前1949年的一倍。
    土改前的老贫农户，现在跃进到富裕户的，和现在仍是困难户的，都是少数。
    由贫农变成新下中农后，能够再变成富裕户的最主要原因，是有人在外边当脱离生产干部或者当工人，常常有钱寄回来。我们调查过3户由贫农上升为富裕户的户，他们在合作社得到的劳动报酬，家庭的自留地，猪、鸡、杂工等副业收入，和普通的中等户大体相等，有的还稍稍少些，但是一加上外出干部或者外出工人的汇款后，纯收入数字便显著地比别的中等户多了许多。
    总是过着贫农生活，土改和合作化都不能使他们翻身的这97户老贫农，贫困的原因很多。我们调查过13户这样的贫农户，其中因儿女增长率高，主要劳动力全丧失或半丧失，副业衰落而仍然贫困的有9户，因旁的原因仍然贫困的4户。
    （二）老下中农生活的变迁：土地改革前的151户老下中农，几年来生活改善的程度比贫农差些，到合作化前只有13户上升到上中农，经过一年合作化，又有11户上升到富裕户，但去年却有本来可以上升到上中农生活的6户老下中农又降到中等生活水平。土改以来，实际上升了的共18户，其余的133户，除3户降为困难户和五保户外，多数户的收入，虽比解放前逐年增多，但没有够着上中农生活水平，部分户的收入还比解放前减少些。据3户老下中农典型户的调查，1949年他们每人平均纯收入只57.3元，1953年增至82.2元，1955年下降到62.2元，1956年又回升到80.7元。
    老下中农生产比贫农生产优越的地方，是养猪、养鸡、小商经营等副业活跃。副业收入多少，对他们的总收入影响很大。1953年收入比1955年多，主要是副业收入较多。现在有一部分老下中农收入比解放前少，也主要是副业收入减少的原故。我们调查了35户老下中农，他们现在总收入较解放前减少，其中因小商贩停业、猪、鸡养得少、人口增多而收入减少的就有24户。
    （三）富裕中农的生活变迁：土地改革前全乡共有8户富裕中农，到合作化前一年，富裕中农（后称上中农），增加到21户。经过一年合作化，这21户新、老上中农中，仍然有17户收入没有显著地减少，过着富裕户的生活。但有4户收入却显著减少，下降到中等生活水平去了。
    少数富裕中农的收入为什么显著的减少了呢？村干部说，主要是入社后剥削和投机行为消灭，副业衰落。
    （四）地主和富农的生活变迁：土地改革前的29户地主、9户富农共38户，生活都降低了。但是近几年他们的纯收入却几乎是年年增加的。特别是1956年成为合作社的候补社员或正式社员以后，纯收入有明显的提高。38户地主、富农，现在除4户过着困难的生活以外，其它34户，现在都过着中等生活。据两户普通地主的调查，以每年每人平均纯收入计，解放前的1949年是121.5元，土改后的1953年降至41.2元，1954年升至53.6元，1955年又降至47.8元，而经过一年合作化，到去年底便突增至71.4元。
    总之，龙冲乡经过土改和合作化，多数的贫雇农户生活水平上升了，特别是合作化以后，生活有显著改善；多数的中农户生活也有了改善，少数的中农户生活略略下降；现在仍然过着困难生活的四分之一的老贫农户，除少数外，生活也稍稍改善；地主、富农生活下降了但又开始上升。这就是龙冲乡解放以后各阶层生活变迁的面貌，也是调查的主要结论。
    四、农民拥护什么？批评什么？
    农民对当地1955年粮食年度（从1954年晚稻收获后算起到1955年晚稻收获前止）的粮食统购统销意见最多。我们专访过的15户农民，无论上中农、下中农、贫农，只要提起这件事，没有一个不批评我们的。所不同的，只是看法不同，不高兴的程度不同。
    1954年度的粮食统购统销，虽然给农民留的口粮和饲料粮也偏紧，但统销较宽，农民叫它做“自由统购”，加以农民这时还有点粮食“家底”，因此1954年粮食情况还过得去。但是1955年度的粮食统购偏紧，统销又偏紧，农民粮食“家底”又空了，农民粮食情况到1955年早稻收成前几个月便相当紧张。上中农粮食宽裕惯了，这时特别受不了，不满程度最大。下中农不满统购统销买走口粮，又抱怨将他们的养猪养鸡副业统掉了。贫农赞成统购统销，说粮食供应有了保证，粮价不会波动，但不赞成统销过紧的做法，说“口粮也买不回来”。
    1956年粮食年度的统购统销，口粮留够了，贫农和下中农是满意的，都说“没有意见”。特别是贫农，他们高兴地说：“还是共产党好，国民党有错不认不改，共产党有错能认能改。”上中农也是满意的，说口粮够吃了，但是还嫌口粮不宽裕，饲料不够。
    1957年粮食统购统销年度，龙冲乡每人（大小口平均）留口粮560斤稻谷，其中一个全劳动力留口粮700斤，一岁至四岁的儿童每人都留口粮300斤。这个数字的稻谷，加上去年自留地每人平均收到的100多斤甘薯和芋头，口粮是足够了。我们亲眼看过十多户农民的仓库，也能看出口粮丰足的情况。全部困难户（贫农户）和绝大部分的中等户（下中农户），对1957年度留给的口粮数字是非常满意的。困难户和少数中等户现在愁的是这么多口粮没现成钱买回来；有的耽心现在买不回来，以后口粮标准会不会紧缩。只有富裕户（上中农）和人口不多的少数中等户还希望多些口粮。
    布票、油票够不够用？城市里许多干部说农村每人一年只给十九尺购布证，每月只给五两购油证，不够穿不够吃。有的区、乡干部也跟着这样说。但是龙冲乡调查的结果却和大家的说法不一样。
    根据9户典型户的调查，困难户去年每人平均买不到一件新单衣，中等户每人添置新单衣也不到两件。困难户每人每月平均吃油三两二钱，中等户每人每月平均吃油不足五两。国家发给的油证够用，布证用不完。中等户和困难户对布证油证没有意见。喊叫布证、油证不够用的主要是富裕户。他们每人每月平均吃油六两到七两，一年做三、四件新单衣，国家发的布证、油证不够用，因此要和大城市比，要求多发油证和布证。
    喊叫猪肉少，咸鱼坏的也是这些富裕户。
    贫农和下中农里那些有困难的户爱社如家，迫切要求把社办好。他们说合作社能抗旱，能合理安排劳动力，更好的是：“一户贫农，一年这么长，很难料到有什么灾祸，在社便有了依靠”。多数下中农，都承认合作社能抗旱，比单干好，但容易动摇（尤其那些老下中农），有几户手头活动些的老下中农这么说：“碰到旱灾，就是办合作社好；风调雨顺，就是单干好。”
    上中农对办合作社最三心二意了。可是单干罢，既怕农忙和抗旱时人力畜力应不上去，更怕干部不摸自己产量的底，多统购少统销多征公粮。他们说：“如果合作社解散，抗旱和农忙时有人帮我的忙，干部再能公平地办统购统销和征收公粮，我便愿意单干。这两条里只要一条办不到，那还是入社的好。”看来，他们大多数对办社的态度是：不退社，赚够口粮，但又不对社抱很多希望，比较消极，把精力放到扩大家庭副业上去增加收入。
    贫农和下中农对去年合作社的生产有三条意见。一、嫌投资大杂支多成本高。去年买水车、推土车、双轮双铧犁、煤油花了2200元，几乎全浪费了。一个贫农说：“如果再仔细点，我们一个劳动日的工价能赚到五角”（现在是四角）。二、嫌手头死，说口粮保证了，但零用钱太少。这是前半年忽视副业生产造成的，后来好些，但它的后果现在还能感觉到。三、嫌社干部听上级的话多，和群众商量的太少。上级有时不摸实情，一个个任务往下压，造成不少浪费。这主要指的冬种小麦和冬种豌豆一事。去年收晚稻以后，县委、区委要龙冲乡种小麦600亩，豌豆1200亩，全是想办好事，但对播种的节令、肥料、人力安排和经营其它作物的关系考虑不周。乡、社干部思想被打通以后，没和群众商量，硬性地执行了区的指示。现在，冬豌豆种得不算吃亏，但冬小麦看来连成本都难收回来。社员说：“那时多听听我们的话就好了”。一个老贫农积极分子说：“现在办社有个上下级关系问题，以后，上下级联系好了，社保证能办好！”
    龙冲乡解放七年多了，无论上中农、下中农、贫农，都说共产党的政治有六条好：一，天下太平，没有飞机炸，没有土匪，没有小偷；二，社会风气好，人都变得勤劳和正派了，多少朝代禁不了的鸦片烟、赌博，在共产党手下几年消灭得干干净净；三，水利好，祖祖辈辈办不到的水利办到了。这三条，包括老上中农都百般喝彩，赞为“德政”。四，票子值钱，这一条上中农最满意；五，土改好，合作化好，解放前十户人家有六七户要籴粮过年，现在翻个过，大家有饭吃，这条贫农最满意；六，共产党大公无私，知错改错。
    农民说共产党的政治有两条不好：一，1955年的粮食统购统销统得太紧太死不好；二，现在，口粮有保证，但是“手头不活动”。
    问到“人民的天下定下来没有？”土改时的老贫农不加思索地顺口答道：“铁桶江山！”老下中农迟疑一下也跟着这样说。老上中农却说：“问题太大答不来。”
