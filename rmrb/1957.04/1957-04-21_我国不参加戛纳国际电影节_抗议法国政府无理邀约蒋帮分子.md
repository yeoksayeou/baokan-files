Xinhua News Agency, April 20th. Wang Lansi, head of the Chinese Film Workers Delegation, sent a telegram today to Favre Le Bret, General Representative of the Cannes Film Festival Association of France, resolutely protesting the French government's invitation to the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique to participate in the film festival, and declared that Chinese film workers refuse to participate in the festival.

In his telegram to Favre Le Bret, General Representative of the Cannes Film Festival Association, Wang Lansi said: "We have learned that while inviting our country to participate in the 10th Cannes International Film Festival, the French government has also invited the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique to participate. The Chinese people and Chinese film workers are extremely indignant at this news. As is known to all, Taiwan is an integral part of China's territory, and the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate government representing the Chinese people. The Chinese people resolutely oppose any conspiracy to create 'two Chinas.' Therefore, we express our resolute protest against the French government's practice of undermining China's sovereignty and dignity.

It must also be pointed out that the French government's invitation to Chiang Kai-shek elements who are falsely using the name of China, at the same time as your association invites our film workers to participate in the Cannes International Film Festival, is detrimental to the ever-increasing friendship between the Chinese and French peoples, and is also a serious damage to the credibility of the Cannes Film Festival. We firmly believe that French friends who are just and have deep friendship with the Chinese people will also feel the same way.

I am now responsible for declaring that we refuse to accept your association's invitation and withdraw the films we have already sent."

    我国不参加戛纳国际电影节
    抗议法国政府无理邀约蒋帮分子
    新华社20日讯　中华人民共和国电影工作者代表团团长王阑西今日打电报给法国戛纳电影节协会总代表法弗尔勒伯莱，坚决抗议法国政府邀约台湾蒋介石集团参加这个电影节，并且声明中华人民共和国电影工作者拒绝参加电影节。
    王阑西在给戛纳电影节协会总代表法弗尔勒伯莱的电报中说：获悉你们在邀请我国参加第十届戛纳国际电影节的同时，法国政府又邀约了台湾蒋介石集团参加，中国人民和中国电影工作者对这个消息感到十分愤慨。众所周知，台湾是中国领土的一部分，中华人民共和国政府是唯一代表中国人民的政府。中国人民坚决反对制造两个中国的任何阴谋，因此我们对于法国政府这种损害中国主权与尊严的做法，表示坚决的抗议。
    还必须指出：法国政府在你会邀请我国电影工作者参加戛纳国际电影节的同时，又邀约假冒中国名义的蒋介石分子，这是对日益增进中的中法人民之间的友谊不利的，而且对戛纳电影节的信誉也是一种严重的损害。我们深信公正而对中国人民怀有深切友情的法国朋友也会有同感的。
    我现在负责声明，我们拒绝接受你会的邀请并撤回我们已寄出的影片。
