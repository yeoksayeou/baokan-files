    Yiliang County Generally Conducts Crop Yield Estimation and Advance Distribution Trial Calculations
    Over 95% of Commune Members Can Increase Income
    (Our Newspaper News) Yiliang County, Yunnan Province, is generally conducting trial calculations for the advance distribution of spring crops. According to the results of the yield estimation and trial calculations, the county's total output will increase by 15%-20% compared to last year. Over 95% of agricultural cooperatives will be able to increase production, and over 95% of commune members can increase their income.
    In the spring crop advance distribution, the general cooperatives can adhere to the principles of "public before private," "retention before distribution," "considering both production and accumulation," and "payment according to labor," correctly handling the relationship between the state and agricultural cooperatives, between cooperatives, and between members. The Yongxing, Wuyi, Hongqi, and Yongji agricultural cooperatives, in addition to paying public grain, retaining sufficient seeds, fodder, and public accumulation and welfare funds, distribute approximately 60%-70% of the total value of the spring crops to their members. As a result of the advance distribution, the income of the members has increased compared to the same period last year. This year, Yongji Cooperative's spring crops, such as wheat, broad beans, and rapeseed, increased by more than 54%. According to the trial calculation results, more than 61% can be distributed to the members, and the actual income of over 95% of the members will increase by 20%-40% compared to the same period last year. Due to the relatively large increase in spring crop production, the surplus grain sold to the state has also increased from more than 90,000 jin to more than 180,000 jin.
    In the distribution steps, many agricultural cooperatives also paid attention to the principle of democratic cooperative management. The spring crop advance distribution plan generally underwent full deliberation and discussion by the masses and was finally approved by the members' representative assembly. At the same time, attention was also paid to the political and ideological education of the members, ensuring the smooth progress of the advance distribution work.
    After the agricultural cooperatives conducted the spring crop trial calculation and advance distribution, the production enthusiasm of the members is even higher, and a high tide of spring plowing and spring sowing has formed throughout the county.

    宜良县普遍进行估产预分试算
    95％以上的社员可以增加收入
    本报讯　云南省宜良县普遍进行小春作物试算预分。根据估产试算的结果，全县将比去年增产15％—20％，95％以上的农业社能够增产，95％以上的社员可以增加收入。
    在小春预分中，一般社都能作到先公后私，先留后分，生产、积累兼顾和按劳取酬的原则，正确地处理了国家与农业社、社与社、社员与社员之间的关系。永兴、五一、红旗、永济等农业社除缴纳公粮、留足籽种、饲料及公积、公益金外，分配给社员的约占小春总产值的60％—70％。预分的结果，社员的收入都比去年同时期增多。永济社今年小麦、蚕豆、油菜等小春作物增产54％以上，试算的结果，61％以上可以分给社员，95％以上的社员的实际收入将比去年同时期增加20％—40％，由于小春作物增产较多，卖给国家的余粮也由九万多斤增加为十八万多斤。
    许多农业社在分配步骤上，还注意了民主办社的方针。小春预分方案，一般都经过群众充分酝酿、讨论，最后经社员代表大会通过。同时，还注意了社员的政治思想教育，保证了预分工作的顺利进行。
    农业社经过小春试算预分后，社员们的生产情绪更高，春耕、春播已在全县形成高潮。
