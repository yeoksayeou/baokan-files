Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Argentine government, under the pretext of so-called "national security," arrested 360 Communist Party leaders across the country on the 12th, and closed 56 party offices nationwide.

The large-scale persecution of the Communist Party took place amidst rising strike movements in Argentina. Nine thousand municipal workers in Buenos Aires and 60,000 slaughterhouse workers in various places recently went on strike one after another, demanding increased wages and improved living conditions. From the beginning, the Argentine government has used the strike movement as an excuse to slander the Communist Party.

According to Western news agencies, during the large-scale roundup, the famous Chilean poet Neruda, who was receiving medical treatment in Argentina, was illegally detained for more than ten hours.

After the arrests, 2,900 railway workers in Junín, the railway center of Buenos Aires Province, immediately went on strike to protest the arrest of two railway worker leaders.

The Argentine government had already announced on April 3 that it was depriving the Argentine Communist Party of the right to participate in elections. There are reports that after this arrest, the Argentine government plans to further declare the Argentine Communist Party illegal.

    恐怖政策保不住动摇的统治
    阿根廷政府大肆迫害共产党
    利诗人聂鲁达一度被非法拘禁
    新华社讯　阿根廷政府12日以所谓“国家安全”为借口，在全国各地逮捕了三百六十名共产党的负责人，并且封闭了党在全国各地的五十六个办事处。
    对共产党的大规模迫害是在阿根廷罢工运动高涨的情况下进行的。布宜诺斯艾利斯的九千名市政工人和各地六万名屠宰工人最近先后举行罢工，要求增加工资，改善生活条件。阿根廷政府从一开始就借口罢工运动来诬蔑共产党。
    据西方通讯社报道，在大肆搜捕中，正在阿根廷治病的智利著名诗人聂鲁达被非法拘禁了十多个小时。
    逮捕发生后，布宜诺斯艾利斯省的铁路中心胡宁的两千九百名铁路工人立即举行罢工，抗议两个铁路工人领袖被捕。
    阿根廷政府在4月3日已经宣布剥夺阿根廷共产党参加选举的权利。有消息说，在这次逮捕后，阿根廷政府还计划进一步宣布阿根廷共产党为非法。
