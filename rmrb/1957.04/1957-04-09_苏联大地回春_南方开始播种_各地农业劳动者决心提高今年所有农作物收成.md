　　 本報莫斯科8日电 Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 8th. Spring is in the air across the Soviet land, spreading from south to north. Spring plowing has begun in the South. Prior to spring plowing, a powerful force – approximately 200,000 tractor operators and drivers – graduated from rural schools. Sowing is underway in Ukraine, with collective farms and state farms planting grains, sunflowers, vegetables, fodder, potatoes, and sugar beets. Ukrainian agricultural workers are participating in the competition to welcome the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, determined to increase yields of all crops this year, including raising grain production by 27%. Most tractor teams are working in two shifts, enabling them to overcome unfavorable weather and seize the time for sowing. In regions such as Odessa, Crimea, and Stanislav, sunflowers are being sown using the square cluster planting method. Ukrainian collective farms are widely using bacterial fertilizers to cultivate seeds before sowing. Collective farms in Ukraine have already sown one million hectares of early spring crops. Cotton planting has commenced in the Uzbek and Kyrgyz Republics. The "Mirzachul" state farm, established on the "Hungry Steppe" only months ago, has planted 2,400 hectares of cotton on reclaimed wasteland. Uzbekistan has already planted tens of thousands of hectares of cotton.

　　 This spring is marked by the fact that Soviet agricultural workers are responding to the call of the Soviet Communist Party, unwilling to be content with the already achieved level of agricultural production, but determined to surpass it and greatly increase the production of meat and milk. Recent regional agricultural worker conferences held in Krasnodar, Rostov, Moscow, Frunze, Gorky, and other places have been filled with this spirit. Soviet Party leaders and advanced agricultural workers have pointed out that it is not enough to be satisfied with the national average figures put forward by the September 1953 Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee. Each region, district, collective farm, and state farm is tapping into its potential for increased production based on specific conditions. The Labinsk district of Kuban averaged 2,100 kilograms of grain per hectare last year. District Party Secretary Yermilov said: "The harvest is higher than other districts. But can this now make us satisfied? For the Labinsk district, this is still too little. Here we have the best black soil, excellent cadres from agricultural machinery stations, and abundant farming techniques." Following the Krasnodar agricultural worker conference, all collective farms in the Labinsk district have re-examined and expanded their spring plowing plans. In addition to grains, Kuban collective farms will increase planting of approximately 600,000 hectares of corn and 55,000 hectares of sugar beets.

    苏联大地回春　南方开始播种
    各地农业劳动者决心提高今年所有农作物收成
    本报莫斯科8日电　在苏联土地上从南向北弥漫着春天的气息。春耕在南方开始了。在春耕前，一支生力军——约二十万拖拉机手和司机从农村学校毕业了。在乌克兰展开播种，集体农庄和国营农场种着谷物、向日葵、蔬菜、牧草、马铃薯、甜菜。乌克兰农业劳动者参加迎接十月革命四十周年的竞赛，决心提高今年所有农作物的收成，包括提高谷物生产27％。大多数拖拉机队分两班工作，所以能够克服不良的气候，抓紧时间播种。敖德萨、克里木、斯塔尼斯拉夫等州以方形穴播法种了向日葵。乌克兰集体农庄在播种前广泛使用细菌肥料来培养种籽。乌克兰的集体农庄已经播种百万公顷的早春作物。在乌兹别克和吉尔吉斯共和国开始种棉花。几个月前才在“饥饿草原”上建立的“米尔查楚尔”国营农场，在开垦的荒地上种了二千四百公顷棉花。乌兹别克斯坦已经种了几万公顷棉花。
    今年春天的标志是：苏联农业劳动者响应苏联共产党的号召，不愿满足于已经达到的农业品的生产水平，而要超过这个水平，大大提高肉类和牛奶的生产。最近在克拉斯诺达尔、罗斯托夫、莫斯科、伏龙芝、高尔基等地所举行的各个区域农业工作者会议，都充满着这种精神。苏联党的领导人和先进农业劳动者指出，不能满足于1953年9月苏共中央全会所提出的全国平均数字。每个州、区、集体农庄和国营农场在根据具体条件发挥增产的潜力。库班的拉宾河口区在去年每公顷土地平均收了二千一百公斤谷物。区委书记叶尔米洛夫说：“收成比别区高。但是现在这难道可以叫我们满足？对于拉宾河口区，这还少。这里有最好的黑土、优秀的农业机器站干部、丰富农作技术。”在克拉斯诺达尔农业工作者会议以后，拉宾河口区的所有集体农庄都重新审查和扩大了春耕计划。除了谷物以外，库班集体农庄将增种约六十万公顷玉米和五万五千公顷甜菜。
