Xinhua News Agency, London, April 1st. One and a half million British mechanical workers and two hundred thousand shipbuilding workers are continuing their strike today.

After negotiations with employers broke down, union leaders held informal discussions on March 31st to study the next steps the mechanical and shipbuilding workers will take.

Meanwhile, in Swansea, thousands of miners, led by three Labour MPs, marched on March 31st to protest the new rent law recently passed by Parliament. Similar marches were held throughout Wales. Swansea MP Percy Morris told the demonstrating workers that the government must be changed because "the current government has failed not only domestically but also internationally."

    英机械和造船工人坚持罢工
    工会领袖正研究采取下一步骤
    新华社伦敦1日电　一百五十万英国机械工人和二十万造船工人的罢工，今天仍然在继续进行。
    工会领袖们在与资方谈判破裂后，曾经在3月31日举行非正式商谈，研究机械和造船工人将要采取的下一步骤。
    同时，在斯温西，有几千名矿工在三个工党议员的领导下，在3月31日举行游行，抗议议会最近通过的新房租法。在整个威尔士，都举行了同样的游行。斯温西的议员佩西，莫尔斯对示威的工人说：必须改变政府，因为“目前的政府不仅在国内而且在国际上都失败。”
