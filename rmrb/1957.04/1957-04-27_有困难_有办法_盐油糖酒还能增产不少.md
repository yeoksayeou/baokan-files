Difficulties Exist, but Solutions Can Be Found
    Salt, Oil, Sugar, and Alcohol Can Still Achieve Significant Production Increases

    (Our Dispatch) Since mid-March, the Ministry of Food Industry has successively convened several professional meetings to study specific measures for increasing production and practicing economy in the salt, edible vegetable oil, cigarette, sugar, and alcohol industries. Based on the information presented at these meetings, the Ministry of Food Industry has decided that, with the exception of cigarettes, the food industry's production cannot meet the demand. Therefore, production must be vigorously increased. The planned output of crude salt this year is 7 million tons, and an additional 560,000 tons is required; the planned output of edible vegetable oil is 1,221,552 tons, and an additional 80,000 tons is required; the planned output of sugar is 873,804 tons, and an additional 15,000 tons is required; the planned output of beer is 40,273 tons, and an additional 4,000 tons is required; and the planned output of white liquor is 524,000 tons, and an additional 12,000 tons is required.

    The biggest difficulty for the food industry this year is the shortage of raw materials. Therefore, at the beginning, some cadres believed that: increasing production and practicing economy was easy for other departments, but we had no way to do it. Some cadres also worried that the quality of products would be poor after using substitutes, and some even believed that ensuring quality was incompatible with increasing production and practicing economy. However, facts have proven that the potential for increasing production and practicing economy in the food industry is still very large. The extraction rates of various products vary greatly between regions and enterprises. The waste in the management of raw material reserves such as sugar beets and grains is also considerable. The losses caused by the return of defective products are even more alarming. Last year, direct subordinate enterprises of the Ministry of Food Industry lost 700,000 yuan due to equipment accidents, and production losses due to accidents amounted to more than 3 million yuan.

    This year, the focus of increasing oil production is on local oil presses. If small liquor factories increase the liquor yield by 2% to 5%, they can produce more than 10,000 tons of liquor with the same amount of raw materials, which is equivalent to saving more than 30,000 tons of grain. If the sugar industry promotes Fujian Province's "water-added pressing method," it can increase sugar production by several thousand tons.

    Another way to increase production and practice economy is to comprehensively utilize raw materials. In the past, eggshells, orange peels, orange seeds, pineapple peels, pineapple cores, minced meat, bones, distillers' grains, etc., that were left over from processing agricultural and livestock products, dairy products, and egg products were not well utilized. Orange peel oil can replace flavorings, but in the past, only a portion of orange peels were sold to pharmacies as medicinal materials. In the past, a lot of distillers' grains could only be used to feed horses and cattle, not pigs, and a lot of it was stockpiled. It is estimated that the country has 3.8 billion jin of white liquor distillers' grains and 200 million jin of alcohol distillers' grains every year. If all of it can be utilized, it can offset 1.516 billion jin of grain and feed 180,000 pigs. Jinan has specially established a distillers' grains processing station to solve the problem of pig feed. By utilizing orange peels and orange seeds when making canned oranges, 142 to 182 yuan more wealth can be created for every ton of oranges processed. The Beijing Food Factory has already used orange peel to make orange oil to replace flavorings in food. Some canning factories make juice from pineapple peels and pineapple cores and put it in the canned goods to keep the pineapple flavor unchanged, and it can also replace sugar. If two-thirds of all pineapple peels and pineapple cores are utilized, 260 tons of sugar can be saved from the fourth quarter of 1957 to the first quarter of 1958. The Tianjin Cannery also utilizes minced meat to make sausages and boils bones to extract oil, and the results are also very good. Currently, many confectionery factories are using substitutes to increase production. Manufacturing every 100 jin of hard candy requires 88 jin of sugar, while making soft candy only requires 40 to 70 jin. The Qishilin Food Factory has trial-produced dozens of new products, such as soft candy, filled candy, walnut candy, jujube kernel candy, etc. It is estimated that without increasing sugar, it can increase the production of candy by more than 360,000 kilograms this year.

### 有困难　有办法  盐油糖酒还能增产不少

    有困难　有办法
    盐油糖酒还能增产不少
    本报讯　从上月中旬以来，食品工业部先后召开了几次专业会议，研究原盐、食用植物油、卷烟、糖、酒等各行业开展增产节约的具体办法。食品工业部根据这些会议提出的资料作出决定，认为食品工业除卷烟外，都是生产不能满足需要的，因此，必须大力增产。原盐今年的计划产量是七百万吨，要求再增产五十六万吨；食用植物油计划产量是一百二十二万一千五百五十二吨，要求再增产八万吨；食糖计划产量八十七万三千八百零四吨，要求再增产一万五千吨；啤酒计划生产四万零二百七十三吨，要求增产四千吨，白酒计划产量五十二万四千吨，要求增产一万二千吨。
    今年食品工业的最大困难是原料不足，所以开始的时候，有的干部认为：别的部门增产节约都好办，唯独我们没有办法。也有一些干部担心使用代用品后，产品质量不好，有的人甚至认为要增产节约就不能保证质量。但是，事实证明，食品工业增产节约的潜力还是很大的。各种产品的收得率，地区之间、企业之间差别很大。甜菜、粮食等原料储备管理过程中的浪费也相当大。因生产废品而造成退货的损失更是惊人。食品工业部直属企业去年因设备事故损失七十万元，由于事故造成减产损失三百多万元。
    今年增产油脂的重点在土榨油坊。制造小酒的工厂，如果提高出酒率2％—5％，那末用同样多的原料，就可以多产一万多吨酒，等于节约三万多吨粮食。制糖业如果推广福建省的“加水压榨法”，就可增产几千吨糖。
    增产节约的另一种办法是综合利用原料。过去加工农畜产品、乳制品和蛋品剩下的蛋壳、桔皮、桔核、菠萝皮、菠萝心、碎肉、骨头、酒糟等，都没有很好利用。桔皮油可以代替香精，但是过去只有一部分桔皮卖给药铺当药材。过去很多酒糟，只能喂马和牛，不能喂猪，积压了很多。估计全国每年有白酒糟三十八亿斤，酒精糟二亿斤，如能全部利用，就可以抵十五亿一千六百万斤粮食，能喂十八万头猪。济南专门成立了酒糟加工站来解决猪的饲料问题。做桔子罐头，把桔皮、桔核都加以利用，每加工一吨桔子，就可以多创造一百四十二元到一百八十二元财富。北京食品厂已经用桔皮制桔油代替香精做食品。有的罐头厂，把菠萝皮、菠萝心做成汁，放在罐头里，保持菠萝味道不变，又可以代替砂糖。如把所有的菠萝皮、菠萝心利用三分之二，1957年第四季度到1958年第一季度就可以节约二百六十吨砂糖。天津罐头厂利用碎肉做香肠，用骨头熬油，效果也很好。目前已有许多糖果厂利用代用品增加产量。制造每百斤硬糖，需要八十八斤砂糖，而做软糖只要四十斤到七十斤。其士林食品厂已试制了几十种新产品，如软糖、夹心糖、核桃糖、枣仁糖等等，估计今年不增加砂糖就可以增产三十六万多公斤糖果。
