    Responding to the Call, Save Cotton Cloth

    If clothes aren't essential, don't make them
    We are the masters of the country, and the country's difficulties are the difficulties of each of us. Therefore, we support the government's decision to halve the supply of cotton cloth.
    We are all students and have not yet directly participated in production, so we should save on clothing even more. Here, we are willing to save cotton cloth with our practical actions. Originally, all three of us were planning to buy cloth to make clothes. For example, Comrade Yu Daofang originally wanted to make a simple and elegant floral cloth dress in the past few days to celebrate the "May Day" holiday, but in order to respond to the Party's call, she decided not to. She said: "In order to save cloth, I decided to take out the clothes that were too bright in the past and wear them, and the faded clothes can also be dyed and worn." Comrade Liu Ming doesn't have many clothes. She originally wanted to make a beautiful floral cloth dress before "May Day," but now she says that some old clothes can still be worn. Based on the situation that it's okay to make them or not, she decided not to make them.
    In order to save cotton cloth, we put forward a few suggestions, hoping that the students will respond.
    1. Try not to make clothes that are not essential;
    2. Look through the bottom of the trunks and try to wear existing old clothes;
    3. Advocate that women wear cheongsams in summer. Cheongsams are beautiful, save cloth, and also have a national style;
    4. If last year's cotton clothes are not too broken, try to repair them and wear them this year;
    5. Faded clothes can be dyed and worn again.

专栏：响应号召，节约棉布

    可做可不做的衣服，就不做
    我们是国家的主人，国家的困难，也就是我们每个人的困难。因此，政府决定棉布折半供应的办法，我们表示拥护。
    我们都是学生，还没有直接参加生产，更应该省穿节用。在这里，我们愿以自己的实际行动节约棉布。本来我们三个人都是准备买布做衣服的，像于道仿同志在最近几天本想做一件朴素大方的花布衣服过“五一”节，但为了响应党的号召，决定不做了。她说：“为了节省用布，我决定把过去太花的衣服拿出穿，褪了色的衣服也可以染一染穿。”流明同志衣服不多，原来想在“五一”节前做一件漂亮的花布连衣裙，现在，她表示有些旧衣服，还可以穿。根据做也可，不做也可的情况，决定不做了。
    为了节省棉布，我们提出几点建议，希望同学们响应。
    一、可以不做的衣服就尽量不做；
    二、翻翻箱底，尽量穿旧有的衣服；
    三、提倡妇女在夏季穿旗袍，旗袍美观又省布，还具有民族风格；
    四、去年的棉衣，如果不太破，今年可以尽量修补穿；
    五、落了色的衣服，可以染一染再穿。
