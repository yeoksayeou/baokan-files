    Unmanned Service Stores Convenience Customers; Ice-Built Refrigerated Warehouses Can Last Ten Years

    In the capital of the German Democratic Republic, Berlin, there is a department store with unmanned service. The furnishings inside the store are designed according to the most modern requirements. The store has an area of ​​500 square meters. The food and candy sold inside are all packaged in bags, and each commodity is marked with the price and weight. When customers select goods, they first re-weigh the quantity of what they want on a balance scale, and then go to the payment counter to pay. Similar stores can also be found in the German Democratic Republic in cities such as Eisenach, Halle, and Erfurt.

    These unmanned department stores reduce management and service personnel and greatly shorten the shopping time for customers. Therefore, they are praised and welcomed by consumers.

    Vietnamese old student, Wei Wenna, who is one hundred and twenty-one years old, was recently praised by President Ho Chi Minh for his active study. Wei Wenna is a farmer of ethnic minorities from Jin Duo Township, Ding Yang County, Yi An Province in northern central Vietnam. In the past, he experienced a century of feudal oppression and suffered all kinds of torment. After this land reform, his life was improved, and his interest in life became even stronger. Recently, he participated in "Literacy Classes for the People" to learn culture. He insists on attending classes every day, studies hard, and makes rapid progress. Now, he is about to finish the primary class course. In addition to studying hard himself, Elder Wei often urges his children and grandchildren to study culture.

    An unusual building, which looks like an ancient tomb, has appeared in the suburbs of the city of Tyumen in the Soviet Union. This is a new cold storage warehouse used by the city's food company to store food, and its main "building material" is water. During the three months of severe winter, the builders froze the floor, walls, and arched dome. The thickness of the floor and walls is three meters. Then, a thick layer of sawdust and cinder is covered on the outside of the building. In this way, no matter how scorching the sun is, it cannot penetrate the ice dome. This ice-built cold storage warehouse can be used for about ten years, and the construction cost can be compensated in one summer. Every spring and summer, it can store about one hundred tons of food. (Attached picture)

    无人服务商店便利顾客  冰造冷藏仓库可用十年
    德意志民主共和国首都柏林有一座无人服务的百货商店。商店里面的陈设都是根据最现代化的要求设计的。这个商店的面积共有五百平方公尺，里面出售的食品和糖果都装在袋子里，每一种商品都标明价格和重量。顾客选购物品的时候，先把自己所要的东西在天平秤上重核一次分量，然后就到付款处去缴款。类似这样的商店还可以在民主德国的埃森纳赫、哈雷和欧法特等城市找到。
    这种无人服务的百货商店，减少了管理和服务人员，并大大缩短了顾客的购货时间，因此它们受到消费者的赞扬和欢迎。
