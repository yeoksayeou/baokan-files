    Presenting a Gift to the 40th Anniversary of the Great October Revolution
    The Soviet People Launch a Socialist Emulation Drive
    (Dispatch from this newspaper) A socialist emulation drive to welcome the 40th anniversary of the Great October Revolution is vigorously underway throughout the Soviet Union. Soviet people in various labor positions are working diligently, preparing to present their labor achievements as a gift to this great festival.
    
    Industrial Enterprises Guarantee Early Completion of Annual Plans
    Industrial enterprises in Moscow have put forward specific guarantees in the competition. According to these guarantees, the entire Moscow industry will complete its annual plan before December 20, and will overproduce products worth 942 million rubles before the festival. It will also save 500 million rubles and more than 7,800 tons of metal by reducing costs and adopting rationalization proposals. In addition, enterprises will use their own strength to build 248,000 square meters of housing.
    
    All parts of the Soviet Union were unwilling to show weakness to the capital. In addition to deciding to complete its annual plan ahead of schedule, the Kirov Factory in Leningrad will design and manufacture 20 new types of machines. The Rostov Agricultural Machinery Factory could produce more than 90 combine harvesters per day at the beginning of the year. Since the competition began, the daily output has increased to 126 units. The construction workers at the Irkutsk Hydropower Station guarantee that the four batches of generator units will begin supplying industrial electricity before the festival.
    
    Agricultural Laborers Strive for a Bumper Harvest This Year
    Agricultural laborers are also welcoming the festival with practical actions to do a good job in spring plowing and strive for a bumper harvest. The peasants of the Kazakh Republic, who achieved an unprecedented agricultural bumper harvest in 1956, are even more enthusiastic. They proposed the slogan of harvesting 1.5 billion poods of grain this year. This spring, they plan to expand the planting area of wasteland by 1 million hectares. A conference of advanced agricultural producers in Siberia was held in Novosibirsk a few days ago. The conference adopted a letter to all agricultural workers in Siberia, calling on everyone to greet the festival with new victories. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan and the Council of Ministers sent a telegram to the conference and challenged the peasant brothers in Siberia on behalf of the agricultural laborers of the republic. Agricultural workers in Siberia have actively responded to the challenge.
    
    Preparing to Publish Important Documents on Party History
    On the cultural front, work to welcome the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution is also being carried out actively.
    
    The Institute of Marxism-Leninism affiliated to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is compiling a series of important documents on the Party's preparation and conduct of the October Revolution. Among the documents being compiled is the "Memorandum of the Central Committee of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (Bolsheviks) from 1917 to 1918," which contains many unpublished materials. Two compilations of the Party's resolutions during the transition from the bourgeois democratic revolution to the socialist revolution and two collections of correspondence between the Secretariat of the Party Central Committee and local Party organizations during this period will be published soon. The work of editing the 55-volume Collected Works of Lenin has also begun, and the first few volumes are expected to be published by the end of this year.
    
    Important books reflecting the economic and cultural achievements of the Soviet Union over the past 40 years have been published one after another, including: "Resolutions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on Economic Issues," "Forty Years of Soviet Economic Development," "The Soviet National Economy in Figures," "Forty Years of Soviet Culture," etc.
    
    Many Literary and Artistic Films on Revolutionary History are Being Filmed
    Before the festival, a series of films based on famous literary and artistic works will be completed. These films include: Tolstoy's "The Road to Calvary," Ko?chuk's "Truth," Sholokhov's "And Quiet Flows the Don," and Ostrovsky's "Born of the Storm." The Gorky Film Studio in Moscow has already begun shooting a film about Lenin in the days of the October Revolution, "The Sentinel of Smolny Palace." A film depicting the friendship between the Soviet and Korean peoples, "Dawn of the East," is also being filmed. "The House I Live In," which won the first prize in the outstanding film script competition, will soon meet the audience on the screen.
    
    To commemorate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union suggested that the Soviet Ministry of Culture organize the production of a series of documentaries reflecting the achievements of Soviet socialist construction. Soviet film studios are now carrying out this work, and are also preparing to shoot historical documentary films titled "The Great October," "Historical Documents," "Lenin's Hometown," and "The Cradle of the Revolution—Leningrad."
    
    Theatrical and Musical Circles Compete to Welcome Festival Programs
    In the Soviet theatrical and musical circles, the socialist emulation drive to welcome the festival is also in full swing. The three Baltic republics of the Soviet Union will jointly hold a music performance competition for the first time, and the works performed will be those composed by composers from these three republics in the past two years. A competition has been launched among the theaters throughout the Soviet Union to see who has prepared a better program for the festival. The Soviet Ministry of Culture strongly supports the enthusiasm of literary and art workers, and decided to hold a national drama, song and dance competition in the capital during the festival. Before this, each republic will first hold its own drama, song and dance competition. Now literary and art groups throughout the Soviet Union are working hard to win the right to participate in the competitions in their own republics and throughout the Soviet Union.

    向伟大的十月革命四十周年献礼
    苏联人民掀起社会主义竞赛热潮
    本报讯　迎接伟大十月革命四十周年的社会主义竞赛在苏联各地蓬勃地开展起来了。站在各个不同劳动岗位上的苏联人民都在积极努力，准备以自己的劳动成果作为对这个伟大节日的献礼。
    工业企业保证提前完成全年计划
    莫斯科各工业企业在竞赛中纷纷提出了具体的保证。根据这些保证，整个莫斯科工业将在12月20日前完成全年计划，并且要在节日前超额生产价值九亿四千二百万卢布的产品，还要通过降低成本和采纳合理化建议的办法节约五亿卢布和七千八百余吨金属；此外，各企业将利用自己的力量建设二十四万八千平方公尺的住宅。
    全苏各地也不甘向首都示弱。列宁格勒基洛夫工厂除了决定提前完成全年计划以外，还要设计和制成二十种新型机器。罗斯托夫农业机器厂在年初每昼夜能生产九十多台收割机，自从竞赛开展以来，每昼夜的产量已提高到一百二十六台。伊尔库次克水电站的建筑工人们保证在节日前使四批联动机开始供应工业用电。
    农业劳动者要争取今年大丰收
    农业劳动者也在以作好春耕、争取大丰收的实际行动迎接节日。1956年取得农业空前大丰收的哈萨克共和国的农民热情更高，他们提出今年要收获十五亿普特谷物的口号，这个春天他们准备扩大一百万公顷荒地的播种面积。前几天，在新西伯利亚召开了西伯利亚农业先进生产者会议。会议通过了告西伯利亚全体农业工作者书，号召大家以新的胜利迎接节日。哈萨克共和国党中央和部长会议向大会致电并代表本共和国的农业劳动者向西伯利亚的农民兄弟们挑战。西伯利亚的农业工作者已积极应战。
    准备出版党史的重要文献
    在文化战线上，迎接十月革命四十周年的工作也在积极进行中。
    苏共中央附属的马克思列宁主义学院正在编著一系列关于党准备和进行十月革命的重要文献。正在编著的文献中有“1917年到1918年俄国社会民主工党（布）中央委员会备忘录”，其中有很多没有发表过的材料。两部在资产阶级民主革命转变到社会主义革命期间的党的决议汇编和两部这个期间党中央书记处同地方党组织通讯集即将出版。编辑五十五卷列宁全集的工作也已经开始了，头几卷预计在今年年底即可问世。
    反映四十年来苏联经济、文化成就的重要书籍已在陆续出版，其中有：“苏联共产党中央委员会关于经济问题的决议”、“苏维埃经济发展的四十年”、“从数字中看苏联国民经济”、“四十年来的苏维埃文化”等。
    正在拍摄许多革命史文艺影片
    在节日以前，一系列根据著名文艺作品编制的影片将拍摄完毕，这些影片中有：托尔斯泰的“苦难的历程”、考?楚克的“真理”、萧洛霍夫的“静静的顿河”、奥斯特洛夫斯基的“暴风雨所诞生的”。莫斯科高尔基制片厂现在已经着手拍摄一部关于列宁在十月革命日子里的影片“斯莫尔尼宫的哨兵”。一部描写苏联和朝鲜人民友谊的电影“东方的曙光”也在拍制中。在优秀电影剧本悬赏中获得一等奖的“我住的那幢房子”，不久也将在银幕上同观众见面。
    为了纪念十月革命四十周年，苏共中央建议苏联文化部组织拍制一系列反映苏联社会主义建设成就的纪录片。现在苏联各制片厂正在进行这项工作，同时还在准备拍摄题为“伟大的十月”、“历史文件”、“列宁的故乡”、“革命的摇篮——列宁格勒”等历史文献纪录片。
    戏剧音乐界比赛迎接节日的节目
    在苏联戏剧界和音乐界，迎接节日的社会主义竞赛也是热火朝天。苏联波罗的海沿岸的三个加盟共和国将首次共同举行音乐演奏比赛会，演奏的作品都是最近两年这三个共和国的作曲家作的。全苏各剧院间展开了竞赛，比赛谁为节日准备的节目更好。苏联文化部大力支持了文艺工作者的积极性，并决定节日时在首都举行全苏戏剧、歌舞比赛演出。在这之前，各加盟共和国首先举行本共和国的戏剧、歌舞比赛演出。现在苏联各地的文艺团体都在努力争取参加本共和国和全苏的比赛会的权利。
