After Studying the People's Daily Editorial
    Qi Wenzhu
    When I was two years old, my father was killed by the Kuomintang. By the time I was eleven, my whole family had died of illness. When I was twelve, the People's Government took me in. At that time, I studied and worked alongside government offices. In 1949, the higher authorities decided to send me to school, and I began my student life. All expenses were provided by the state. This year, I will graduate from high school. I originally planned to go to university for further study and learn some specialized knowledge for our socialist construction. However, after hearing that the number of university admissions this year would be small, and that those who failed to get into university would have to return to their hometowns to participate in agricultural production, I experienced some ideological fluctuations. I thought, "I haven't been home for eleven years. What will happen if I don't get into university and have to go home?"

    But after studying the People's Daily editorial "On the Issue of Middle and Primary School Graduates Participating in Agricultural Production," my concerns were completely dispelled. The editorial enhanced my understanding of this issue and answered the questions I didn't understand.

    First of all, the editorial helped me clearly realize that farming is not "shameful," not a "waste of talent," and not "without prospects;" but rather, it is full of promise and has a great future. Agriculture occupies an important position in our national economy. The countryside is now collectivized and will undergo technical reforms in the future, becoming mechanized and scientific. Our middle school graduates are very much needed for agricultural production in the future.

    Participating in agricultural production has "no great future," which is what I originally thought. Reading the People's Daily editorial made me have a very clear understanding of this issue. We all know that the motherland has a great future, and the countryside has a great future. Of course, our knowledgeable young people building a new socialist countryside also have an extremely bright future. If we return to the countryside, mingle with the peasants, are not afraid of difficulties, work diligently, and humbly learn from the peasants, we will be able to fully play our role in the cause of developing agricultural production. I have now decided to directly participate in labor after returning to the countryside.

    I also wondered, can the things we learned be used when we return to the countryside? Wouldn't it be a waste of learning if we can't use them? The People's Daily editorial made it very clear that whoever masters the general knowledge learned in middle school has laid the foundation for further study. Whether or not it can be used depends on whether or not you are willing to work hard and whether or not you are willing to be attentive.

    We also know that after returning to our hometowns to participate in agricultural production, we may be subjected to the pressure of incorrect social opinions. But the People's Daily editorial helped us analyze this issue, pointed out the attitude we should take towards this issue, and suggested ways to overcome these difficulties, increasing our confidence. It is precisely because there are difficulties and shortcomings in the countryside that we young students need to strive. We should treat this issue with a revolutionary spirit.

    I am now ideologically prepared. If I don't get into university, I will go home to participate in agricultural production, apply the cultural and scientific knowledge I have learned over the years to production, and truly become a cultured, new-style farmer.

    学习人民日报社论以后
    齐文柱
    在我两岁的时候，父亲被国民党杀害了，到我十一岁时，全家的人，都病死了，十二岁那年，人民政府就把我收养起来。那时我在机关边学习，边工作。到了1949年，上级决定让我上学，从此我开始了学生生活。所有一切费用，全部由国家供给。今年我就要在高中毕业了，本来打算进大学深造，为我国社会主义建设学点专门知识；自听到今年大学招生人数少，考不上学的要回乡参加农业生产时，思想上曾起了一些波动。我想：“我已十一年不回家了，考不上学要回家，这怎么办呢？”
    但是在学习过人民日报“关于中小学毕业生参加农业生产问题”的社论以后，我的顾虑完全解除了。社论提高了我对这一问题的认识，回答了我所没有弄明白的问题。
    社论首先帮助我清楚地认识到种地不“丢人”，不“屈才”，不是“没有出息”；而是大有出息，大有前途的。农业在我国国民经济中占有重要的地位。现在的农村已合作化了，今后还要实行技术改革，要机械化、要科学化。今后的农业生产是非常需要我们这些中学毕业生的。
    参加农业生产“前途不大”，原来我也是这样想的。看了人民日报的社论，使我对这个问题有了极其明确的认识。我们谁都知道祖国前途远大，农村前途远大。当然我们建设社会主义新农村的知识青年前途也是极其光明远大的。如果我们回到农村以后，和农民打成一片，不怕困难，踏踏实实地劳动，虚心地向农民学习。我们就会在发展农业生产的事业中充分发挥作用。我现在确定到农村以后就直接参加劳动。
    原来我也考虑过，我们学的东西回到农村能用得上吗？要用不上不是白学了吗？人民日报社论说的非常清楚，中学里学的普通知识，谁掌握了这些知识，谁就打下了进一步学习的基础。能不能用上，就看自己肯干不肯干，肯用心不肯用心。
    我们也知道在回乡参加农业生产后，可能受到不正确的社会舆论的压力。但是人民日报社论帮助我们分析了这个问题，指出我们对这个问题应抱的态度，给我们想了克服这些困难的办法，增加了我们的信心，也正因为农村存在着困难和缺点，才需要我们青年学生去奋斗，我们应该以革命的精神去对待这问题。
    我现在已经作好思想准备。考不上大学，我就回家去参加农业生产，把自己几年来所学的文化科学知识，运用到生产中去，真正地做一个有文化的新式农民。
