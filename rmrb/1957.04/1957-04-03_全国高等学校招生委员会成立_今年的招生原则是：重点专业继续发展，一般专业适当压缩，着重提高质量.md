Xinhua News Agency, April 2nd—The National Higher Education Enrollment Committee was established in Beijing today. Yang Xiufeng, Minister of Higher Education, said at the first meeting of the Enrollment Committee today that this year's enrollment principle for institutions of higher learning is: key disciplines continue to develop, general disciplines are appropriately reduced, and emphasis is placed on improving quality. He said that improving quality is the central task of higher education in the future.

Yang Xiufeng said that from the perspective of the development of higher education, it is more prudent to appropriately reduce this year's enrollment task. After completing the preliminary planned enrollment target of 107,000 students this year, national colleges and universities will have enrolled a total of 563,000 students, including the previous four years, exceeding the original Five-Year Plan enrollment target of 546,000 students by 3.1%. From the perspective of the country's planned training of cadres according to needs and possibilities, it is also necessary to place the development of higher education on a solid foundation. Yang Xiufeng requested that ideological education work and guidance for students in choosing their desired institutions be strengthened.

The first meeting of the Enrollment Committee, held today, exchanged views on this year's enrollment work and some new improvement measures.

The National Higher Education Enrollment Committee is composed of responsible persons from relevant business departments and institutions of higher learning, with Yang Xiufeng serving as the Chairman of the Committee.

    全国高等学校招生委员会成立
    今年的招生原则是：重点专业继续发展，一般专业适当压缩，着重提高质量
    新华社2日讯　全国高等学校招生委员会今天在北京成立。高等教育部部长杨秀峰在今天召开的招生委员会第一次会议上说，今年高等学校的招生原则是：重点专业继续发展，一般专业适当压缩，着重提高质量。他说，提高质量是今后高等教育的中心任务。
    杨秀峰说，从高等教育的发展来看，今年招生任务适当压缩是比较稳妥的。今年全国高等学校在完成初步拟定的招生计划十万七千人以后，连同前四年共招生五十六万三千人，比第一个五年计划原定招生数五十四万六千人还超额3.1％。从国家按照需要与可能，有计划地培养干部来说，把高等教育的发展放在稳妥的基础上也是必要的。杨秀峰要求对考生加强思想教育工作和选择升学志愿的指导工作。
    今天举行的招生委员会第一次会议就今年的招生工作和一些新的改进措施交换了意见。
    全国高等学校招生委员会由各有关业务部门和高等学校的负责人组成，由杨秀峰担任主任委员。
