Implement the Guiding Principles for Metallurgical Industry Construction

In our country's socialist construction, a large amount of steel and non-ferrous metals are needed. However, from 1907, when China built its first modern steel plant, to the national liberation in 1949, in the forty-two years, China's annual steel production, including the Northeast once occupied by Japan, never exceeded one million tons. This extremely backward metallurgical industry naturally cannot meet the needs of our country's socialist construction. During the First Five-Year Plan period, under the guidance of the state's policy of vigorously developing the metallurgical industry, and through the efforts of all employees of the metallurgical industry, although the targets of the Five-Year Plan were overfulfilled ahead of schedule, several large enterprises have been built and are being built, and a number of small and medium-sized enterprises have been expanded, in terms of absolute quantity and product variety, China's metallurgical industry is still very backward. In 1957, steel production was only about five million tons, far from meeting the needs of all parties. How to rapidly improve the level of the metallurgical industry is a major issue of concern to the people of the whole country.

At present, our country is still an economically backward country, and the supply of construction funds and technical equipment is limited. The construction of the metallurgical industry requires a lot of funds and technical equipment. Therefore, when considering the development speed of China's metallurgical industry, we must consider the extent to which the state can supply funds and equipment. The task of metallurgical workers is to strive for rapid development of the metallurgical industry within the scope of the country's financial and material resources, according to the needs of the country.

In the Second and Third Five-Year Plans, China needs to build more small and medium-sized metallurgical enterprises; according to China's situation, more general technical equipment should be used in construction; when renovating old factories, full use should be made of the original foundation. This can save funds and speed up the development of the metallurgical industry. This is the guiding principle for China's metallurgical industry construction.

During the First Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union helped China design several large steel and non-ferrous metal enterprises. Some of these enterprises have been completed and some are under construction. These modern enterprises using the world's latest technology can produce high-quality, important products and are the backbone of China's metallurgical industry. In the early stage of construction, it was absolutely necessary to build a certain number of large metallurgical enterprises in China, where the metallurgical industry foundation was extremely weak. With these enterprises, favorable conditions have been created for the development of China's metallurgical industry. However, the construction of these large enterprises requires a lot of funds, a long construction period, and the most modern equipment. If we continue to focus on building large metallurgical enterprises in the future, that is, during the Second and Third Five-Year Plan periods, most of the limited funds will be concentrated on a few industrial bases, and the investment effect cannot be exerted for a considerable period of time, which will affect the rapid improvement of the metallurgical industry's production level. For example, the construction of a steel plant with an annual output of 1.5 million tons requires about 1.2 to 1.5 billion yuan of funds, and it takes about nine years from design to completion, and iron can only be produced in the sixth year. With the same amount of funds, 11 to 13 steel plants with an annual output of about 160,000 tons can be built. Each plant takes about four years from design to completion, and iron can be produced in the third year. That is to say, the total production quantity of building small steel plants with the investment of building a large steel plant of 1.5 million tons can reach 1.7 million to 2 million tons. Because the construction is fast, hundreds of thousands of tons of pig iron and steel can be produced in the same time. Why does building small and medium-sized enterprises save more investment than building large enterprises? This is because large enterprises must use highly mechanized and automated equipment, and construction also requires factoryization and mechanization. These require a lot of funds. At the same time, urban construction serving large enterprises also requires a lot of investment. Small and medium-sized enterprises can use general production equipment, and construction can use less or no machinery, and the construction of residential areas is relatively simple. In these areas, a lot of investment can be saved. Not only that, building more metallurgical enterprises in various places can make full use of local resources, absorb more people into employment, drive local economic development, and make the industrial layout more reasonable. These benefits cannot be fully calculated with numbers.

After China has built some metallurgical enterprises using the latest technology, a thought of blindly pursuing the world's latest technology has emerged among cadres and technicians. Of course, new technology represents the new force of productivity and is one of the signs of a country's scientific and technological level. In China's metallurgical industry construction, new technologies should be adopted in a focused manner to improve labor productivity, improve product quality, and improve labor conditions. However, adopting the latest technology often costs a lot of money. Inappropriately emphasizing new technologies, regardless of the importance and urgency, and requiring the latest technical equipment in all aspects will inevitably cause great waste. The construction of a fully automated seamless steel pipe plant with an annual output of 60,000 tons requires an investment of more than 60 million yuan, while the construction of a seamless steel pipe plant with general technical equipment and an annual output of 150,000 tons only requires about 30 million yuan, and the product quality is completely up to standard. Most of the latest technical equipment cannot be manufactured in China at present and must be ordered from abroad. From this, we can see that if we determine the technical level of various types of enterprises separately, make full use of domestically produced equipment, and adopt the commonly used technical equipment in the world according to China's actual situation, we can greatly save funds, build more metallurgical factories and mines, and produce more steel and non-ferrous metals.

In the renovation of old factories, in order to increase output, improve product quality, and improve labor conditions, the original factories and mines should be appropriately renovated. This has a great effect on increasing the production level of the metallurgical industry. However, there is a tendency of "being fond of the big and new" in the current renovation of old factories. As soon as reconstruction is mentioned, the original equipment and buildings must be demolished and replaced with new ones, and even mechanization and automation are adopted without limit. This practice often destroys the original productivity and is not worth the loss. After the reconstruction of a refractory material factory, although the output increased four times, because it was completely mechanized, the original equipment and plant buildings were used very little. This only cost 2 million yuan less than building the same factory, but it completely demolished a factory that could produce 20,000 tons of refractory bricks a year. How uneconomical this is! In the future, if we adopt the correct guiding principles, and preserve and utilize the old equipment, buildings, and all fixed assets as much as possible during the renovation, and do not easily abandon the original productivity, it will reduce a lot of waste and squeeze out money to build more new factories and mines.

Some comrades have not figured out that more funds should be concentrated on building small and medium-sized metallurgical enterprises in the Second and Third Five-Year Plan periods in the future. This is because large enterprises do have their advantages: high labor productivity, low cost, some products can only be produced by large enterprises, and they believe that large enterprises represent the technical level of China's metallurgical industry. However, it is not comprehensive to only see these points. In the coming period, building more small and medium-sized enterprises does not deny the superiority of large enterprises, nor does it mean that large enterprises will not be built at all in the future. In China's current situation, on the one hand, funds are not very abundant, and on the other hand, the few large enterprises that have been built and are under construction are not reasonably distributed in terms of region. If we still concentrate most of the limited funds on building a few large enterprises that cost a lot of money and take a long time, it will delay the development of the metallurgical industry and make the regional distribution of the metallurgical industry more unreasonable, forming a guiding policy error. In the future, when the level of China's metallurgical industry has been greatly improved, the national strength is sufficient, and large equipment can be produced entirely or mostly domestically, we will build more technologically advanced large metallurgical complexes.

The experience summed up by the metallurgical industry and the above-mentioned guiding principles they have determined are also of great significance to other industrial sectors. Various industrial sectors are also summing up their own experiences and studying the future construction guiding principles of their departments. We believe that this will greatly benefit the further development of China's industry.

### 贯彻冶金工业建设方针

    贯彻冶金工业建设方针
    我国在社会主义建设中，需要大量钢铁和有色金属。可是，从1907年我国建设第一座近代化钢铁厂起，到1949年全国解放时止，四十二年间，我国钢的年产量包括曾被日本占领的东北在内，始终没有超过一百万吨。这种极端落后的冶金工业，自然不能适应我国社会主义建设的需要。第一个五年计划期间，在国家大力发展冶金工业的方针下，经过冶金工业全体职工的努力，虽然提前超额完成了五年计划的指标，建设起和正在建设着几个大型企业和扩建了若干中小型企业，但就绝对数量和产品品种来说，我国冶金工业仍然是很落后的。1957年钢的产量不过五百万吨左右，远远不能满足各方面的需要。如何迅速提高冶金工业的水平，是全国人民所关心的一件大事。
    目前我国还是一个经济落后的国家，建设资金和技术装备的供应都有一定的限度，而冶金工业的建设需要大量资金和技术装备，因此在考虑我国冶金工业的发展速度时，必须根据国家资金和设备可能供应的程度。冶金工业工作者的任务，就是要根据国家的需要，在国家财力和物力的可能范围内，争取冶金工业迅速的发展。
    在第二个和第三个五年计划中，我国需要更多地建设中小型冶金企业；根据中国情况，在建设中应该更多地采用一般的技术设备；在对旧厂进行改造的时候，要充分利用原有的基础。这样既能节约资金，又能加快冶金工业的发展速度。这是我国冶金工业建设的方针问题。
    在第一个五年计划中，苏联帮助我国设计了几个大型的钢铁企业和有色金属企业。这些企业有的已经建成，有的正在建设。这些近代化的采用世界最新技术的企业，能够生产质量高的重要的产品，是我国冶金工业的骨干。在建设初期，在冶金工业基础极端薄弱的我国，建设这样一定数目的大型冶金企业是完全必要的。有了这些企业就创造了我国冶金工业发展的有利条件。但是，建设这些大型企业所用的资金很多，建设所需要的时间也很长，要求的设备也最新式。如果我们在今后，即在第二个和第三个五年计划期间，仍以建设大型冶金企业为主，那就会把有限的资金大部分集中用于几个工业基点上，在一个相当长的时期内不能发挥投资效果，影响冶金工业生产水平的迅速提高。例如，建设一个年产一百五十万吨的钢铁厂需要资金十二亿至十五亿元左右，从设计到建设完毕约需九年时间，要到第六年才能出铁；而用同等数量的资金，建设年产十六万吨左右的钢铁厂，可以建设十一至十三个，每一个厂从设计到建设完毕，约需四年时间，在开始的第三年就可以出铁。也就是说用建设一百五十万吨大型钢铁厂的投资去建小型钢铁厂，它的总生产数量可以达到一百七十万至二百万吨。因为建设得快，在同样时间内，可以多生产几十万吨生铁和钢材。为什么建设中小型企业会比建设大型企业节省投资呢？这是因为大型企业非采用高度机械化自动化的设备不可，施工也需要工厂化、机械化。这些都需要大量的资金。同时，为大型企业服务的城市建设，也需要很多的投资。而中小型企业可以采用一般的生产设备，施工可以少用和不用机械，住宅区的建设也比较简单，在这些方面可以节省许多投资。不但这样，在各地分散建设较多的冶金企业，可以充分利用各地资源，可以吸收更多的人就业，带动地方经济的发展，并且使工业布局更加合理。这些好处，是不能完全用数字计算的。
    在我国建设起一些采用最新技术的冶金企业以后，在干部中和技术人员中产生一种盲目追求世界最新技术的思想。当然，新技术是代表生产力的新生力量，是一个国家科学技术水平的标志之一。在我国冶金工业建设中是应该有重点地采用新技术，以达到提高劳动生产率、提高产品质量、改善劳动条件的目的。但是采用最新技术往往需要花很多钱。不恰当地强调新技术，不分轻重缓急，在一切方面都要求最新技术装备，就必然造成很大浪费。建设一个完全自动化的年产六万吨的无缝钢管厂，需要投资六千万元以上，而建设一般的技术装备年产十五万吨的无缝钢管厂，只要三千万元左右，产品质量也完全合乎要求。最新技术装备，大部分是我国目前所不能制造的，必须向国外订货。从这里可以看出，如果我们根据我国实际情况，在节约资金和充分采用国内自制的设备的条件下，分别地规定各类企业的技术水平，多采用目前世界上通常的技术装备，就可以大大地节约资金，可以建设更多的冶金工厂、矿山，可以生产更多的钢铁和有色金属。
    在旧厂的改造上，为了提高产量、改进产品质量、改善劳动条件，应当对原有厂矿进行适当的改造。这对增长冶金工业生产水平有很大作用。但是，目前在旧厂改造上却存在“好大喜新”的倾向。一谈到改建，就要对原有设备和建筑物拆旧换新，甚至无限制地采用机械化自动化。这种作法常常破坏了原有的生产力，是得不偿失的。有一个耐火材料厂，改建之后，虽然产量提高了四倍，但因为完全采用机械化，原有设备和厂房利用得很少，这样仅比新建同样工厂少花二百万元，可是却将一个一年可以生产两万吨耐火砖的工厂完全拆掉了。这是多么不合算的事！今后如果采用正确的方针，在改造的时候，尽可能保存和利用旧有的设备、建筑物和一切固定资产，不轻易废弃原有的生产力，将会减少很多浪费，挤出钱来建设更多的新工厂和矿山。
    有的同志对今后在第二个和第三个五年计划期中，应该集中更多的资金建设中小型冶金企业没有想通。这是因为大型企业确有它的优越性：劳动生产率高，成本低，有些产品只有大企业才能生产，而且认为大企业是代表我国冶金工业技术水平的。但是，只看到这几点是不全面的。在今后一个时期内，更多地建设中小型企业，这并不是否认大型企业的优越性，也不是说今后完全不建设大型企业。在我国目前情况下，一方面资金不十分宽裕，一方面已经建设起来和正在建设的少数大型企业，在地区分布上并不合理。如果我们仍然集中有限资金的大部分去建设花钱多、费时久的少数大型企业，那就会耽误冶金工业的发展，使冶金工业的地区分布更加不合理，形成方针性的错误。将来在我国冶金工业水平有了很大的提高、国力充足和国内能够全部或大部生产大型设备的情况下，我们还将建设更多的技术上先进的大型冶金联合企业。
    冶金工业方面所总结出来的经验，和他们所确定的上述方针，对于其他的工业部门也是很有意义的。各工业部门也正在总结自己的经验，研究本部门今后的建设方针，我们相信，这将会大大有利于我国工业的进一步发展。
