Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: In the fruit-producing areas along the Yellow River and the Huangshui River on the Qinghai Plateau, peach and apricot blossoms are in full bloom, and pear and plum blossoms are budding. Sand pear trees and walnut trees have sprouted new buds.

In Minhe County, downstream of the Huangshui River, there are more than ten varieties of pear and peach trees. The winter pears, which ripen in early winter, have tender and sweet flesh, and some weigh as much as one pound each. The area also produces a walnut with high oil content and thick flesh, the shell of which can be cracked open with one's teeth. Guide County and Xunhua Salar Autonomous County, along the Yellow River, produce large apricots that weigh more than two taels each. When the apricots fall from the trees, all you see is a small apricot pit, the ripe apricot flesh falling apart upon impact.

In recent years, Qinghai Province has been transplanting fruit trees from river valleys to dry mountain areas. Apples and grapes can now be grown in areas west of Xining at altitudes of over 2,000 meters.

    青海高原桃杏花开
    据新华社讯　青海省高原上黄河和湟水沿岸的水果产区，桃花和杏花盛开，梨花和李花含苞待放。沙果树和核桃树已长出新芽。
    湟水下游的民和县，梨树和桃树都有十多种，初冬成熟的冬果梨肉嫩味甜，有的一个重一斤。这里还产一种油多肉厚的核桃，核桃壳用牙一磕就开。黄河边的贵德县和循化撒拉族自治县出产有每个重二两多的大杏。当杏子从树上掉下来时，你只能看到一个小小的杏核，熟透的杏肉一跌便碎了。
    近年来，青海省正在把果树由川地向山旱地移植，苹果、葡萄已经可在拔海两千公尺以上的西宁以西地区种植。
