Xinhua News Agency, London, April 3rd: The leaders of the federation of shipbuilding workers and engineering workers unions, representing forty unions, met here on the 2nd and decided by a vote of 710,000 to 449,000 to end the strike of engineering and shipbuilding workers, ordering the workers to return to work on the 4th. In fact, most unions wanted to continue the strike, but the collective votes of the large unions overruled their opinions.

William Carron, chairman of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, the largest union in the shipbuilding and engineering industries, voted in favor of returning to work. He controlled 500,000 of the federation's total of 1,256,500 votes. Thus, after three hours of heated debate, his single vote determined the order to return to work. Some of the striking workers gathered outside the federation's meeting hall on Blackfriars Road in London at noon on the 2nd. When the union leaders left the meeting hall, the striking masses shouted: "You betrayed us!" "We were abandoned!" William Carron's hat was knocked off. He might have been beaten had the police not arrived to escort him away.

    违背多数工会坚持罢工的愿望
    英工会领袖决定结束罢工
    据新华社伦敦3日电　造船工人及机械工业工人工会联合会所属四十个工会的领导人2日在这里开会，以七十一万票对四十四万九千票决定结束机械工人和造船工人的罢工，并且下令工人在4日复工。事实上，大多数工会想继续罢工，但是大工会的集体票把它们的意见否决了。
    造船业和机械工业中最大的工会混合机械工业工会主席威廉·卡隆投票主张复工，在联合会总共一百二十五万六千五百票中间，他占了五十万票。所以在三个小时的激烈争辩以后，他一个人的投票便决定了复工的命令。一部分罢工工人2日中午集合在伦敦黑衣教士路联合会会议厅外面。当工会领袖们离开会场时，罢工群众高呼：“你们把我们出卖了。”“我们被抛弃了”。威廉·卡隆的帽子被打掉了。要不是警察赶来护送他，他可能挨揍。
