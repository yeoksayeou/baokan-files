Responding to the Call to Save Cotton Fabric

    We Can Make Fewer Summer Clothes
    Hu Yuefeng
    The cotton planted last year by the Jianguo Agricultural Production Cooperative in the western suburbs of Beijing suffered from flooding, and the planned quota for selling cotton to the state was not fulfilled. Therefore, we understand even more the importance of cherishing cotton and saving cotton fabric, and we support the state's decision.
    The halving of cloth coupons will not have any impact on our lives. Take my family for example, my wife bought two floral shirts last year that didn't require cloth coupons, and she can still wear them this year. Originally, we planned to make a floral dress for our daughter Yulan this summer, but now that we think about it, it's okay if we just make do. We have decided to make fewer clothes this summer and use the money saved in the places where it is most needed. (Attached image)

    我们可以少做夏衣
    胡越峰
    北京西郊建国农业生产合作社去年种的棉花，就是因为受了涝，卖给国家的棉花没有完成计划。所以我们更懂得要爱惜棉花、节约棉布的道理，拥护国家这个决定。
      布票打对折，对我们的生活不会有什么影响。就拿我的家庭说，我的妻子去年就买了两件不要布票的花衬衫，今年还可以穿。本来我们打算在今年夏天再给女儿玉兰作件花裙衣，现在想想，不作也可以凑和。我们决定今年夏天少做衣服，把省下的钱用到最需要的地方去。（附图片）
