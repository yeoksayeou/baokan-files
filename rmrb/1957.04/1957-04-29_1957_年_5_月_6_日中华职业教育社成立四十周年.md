I.
	Not chasing fleeting blossoms, yet self-respecting.
	Ice and frost transform into protectors of the thatched door.
	With painstaking effort, a thousand bamboo stalks are planted.
	Entrust them to those who plan for windows and doors.

Revised from my old work for the 30th anniversary of the Society in 1947. At that time, the Society was seeking survival in extreme darkness, with Kuomintang secret agents registering visitors to the Society every day. On the eve of the Anti-Japanese War, the Society established seven supplementary schools in Shanghai. A large portion of two classes from the Fourth Supplementary School joined the New Fourth Army.

II.
	The mulberry sea turns back forty years.
	The same year, the October Revolution in the Soviet Union was celebrated.
	The classics of Marx and Engels were never read.
	But the plaque of "Sacred Labor" was hung early.

In 1918, the "Chinese Vocational School" was established, with ironwork, woodwork and other departments, and a machine factory attached. In classrooms and workshops, large plaques with the words "Sacred Labor" were hung. On May 1st, 1919, workers and students gathered, marking China's first May Day gathering.

III.
	Blueprints and lignite were intimately connected.
	From morning to night, the sound of books and the sound of iron striking were heard.
	"Vocational" was once called "committing sins".
	All kinds of ridicule and scolding were tolerated.

"Vocational education" was then ridiculed and scolded by people, called "committing sins education," believing it misled children.

IV.
	Goodwill arises from nature.
	The cries of unemployment are too pitiful.
	Construction today respects technology.
	A blind man on a blind horse takes the first whip.

When the Society was first established, it issued the slogan: "To enable the unemployed to have employment, and the employed to enjoy their work."

A Critique of Marxist Political Economy, 1842-43 (Marx 24, 25 years old), editor-in-chief of the Rheinische Zeitung. He described: "At that time, goodwill greatly exceeded practical knowledge."

V.
	A team of young people are madly saving the country.
	Waving fireflies to fight the dimness.
	Side winds and upward rains have all been experienced.
	Finally seeing the red sun in the East.

    修改1947年社三十周年旧作，那时社正从极端黑暗中求生存，蒋政府特工天天到社登记来客。对日抗战的前夕，社在上海创设七个补习学校，仅第四补校就有两班学生的大部分投入新四军。
