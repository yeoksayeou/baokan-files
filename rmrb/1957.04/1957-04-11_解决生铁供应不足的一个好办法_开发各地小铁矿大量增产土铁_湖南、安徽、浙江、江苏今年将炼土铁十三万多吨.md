Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 10th: Local state-owned and joint state-private small iron factories in Hunan Province originally planned to produce 74,000 tons of various types of pig iron this year, but this has now been revised to 94,000 tons, an increase of more than 41,000 tons compared to last year.

Many places in Hunan Province have small-scale iron ore deposits, suitable for small-scale mining and smelting. At present, the number of new-style small blast furnaces in the province has increased from three before liberation to nineteen. This type of small blast furnace has simple equipment and can produce 5 to 25 tons per day. The gray cast iron produced can be used for modern industrial casting. In addition, the output of local pig iron from local blast furnaces and local brick furnaces in Hunan Province has also increased since liberation. In 1955, some local blast furnaces stopped production due to the accumulation of products and the difficulty in obtaining charcoal, but there are currently still 25 local blast furnaces and 79 local brick furnaces. The white cast iron produced by local blast furnaces and local brick furnaces can be used to make castings that do not require processing, such as pots and plowshares. After white cast iron is processed into wrought iron, it can also be used to make agricultural tools and iron products for daily use by farmers.

In addition to supplying the rural areas and industrial and mining enterprises of Hunan Province, the pig iron produced in Hunan Province will also support the production enterprises in Shanghai, Guangzhou and other places.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 10th: Anhui Province already has 199 iron smelting furnaces in operation. This year, the province's output of local iron will increase from more than 3,000 tons last year to 20,000 tons. At present, these iron smelting units are actively purchasing iron sand and charcoal, and doing a good job in reserving raw materials and fuel. Many local iron smelting units have also signed contracts with agricultural cooperatives to purchase iron sand and charcoal from the agricultural cooperatives.

In order to complete the production plan of local iron, Anhui Province has strengthened its leadership over the production of local iron. The local committees of the Communist Party of China in the Liu'an area have established leading groups for the production of local iron, led personally by the deputy secretary of the Party committee. In the past, the iron smelting furnaces in various places only produced for six or seven months a year due to insufficient raw materials and fuel, and the iron smelting furnaces put into production were also under-utilized. This year, the relevant departments in the local iron producing areas will vigorously help agricultural cooperatives arrange labor and correctly solve the distribution of income for cooperative members, so as to give play to the enthusiasm of farmers in panning for iron sand and burning charcoal, so as to ensure that the iron smelting furnaces get enough raw materials and fuel. In this way, the time that iron smelting furnaces are put into production in a year can generally be extended by two months compared to the past.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 10th: Zhejiang Province is striving to produce 12,000 tons of local iron this year. This figure is more than three times higher than the actual output of local iron last year. Of the local iron produced this year, 7,000 tons will be produced by local iron handicraft production cooperatives or as a sideline by agricultural cooperatives, and the remaining 5,000 tons will be completed by the two new small blast furnaces built this year. At present, the small iron smelting plant under construction in Yunhe County, a major local iron producing area, has already started construction and will be put into production in May.

Zhejiang Province is rich in resources required for the production of local iron. According to incomplete statistics, the province's iron ore reserves are in the tens of millions of tons. The Wenzhou area has the largest reserves. According to statistics from Yunhe and Qingtian counties in this area alone, the iron sand reserves are more than 50 million tons. At present, there are 74 melting furnaces and 66 smelting furnaces in the province. However, the production technology was very backward in the past. This year, in order to improve the quality of local iron, the handicraft departments of Zhejiang Province will not only adopt advanced methods of iron smelting in the two new small blast furnaces, but also improve the technical level in the sideline production of local iron handicraft cooperatives and agricultural cooperatives through the exchange of experiences.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 10th: Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, Xuzhou and other places in Jiangsu Province are building or preparing to build small blast furnaces to actively increase pig iron production. It is estimated that Jiangsu Province will produce more than 7,000 tons of pig iron this year.

Jiangsu is rich in iron ore resources and has a long history of smelting production. According to legend, Suzhou knew how to smelt iron in the fifth century BC. The story of King Helu of Wu ordering Gan Jiang to smelt iron and cast swords, recorded in the Wu Yue Chunqiu, is a famous story of iron smelting. (Attached picture)

    解决生铁供应不足的一个好办法
    开发各地小铁矿大量增产土铁
    湖南、安徽、浙江、江苏今年将炼土铁十三万多吨
    据新华社长沙10日电　湖南省地方国营和公私合营小铁厂，原计划今年生产各种生铁七万四千吨，现已修改为九万四千吨，比去年增加四万一千多吨。
    湖南省很多地方都蕴藏有小规模的铁矿，宜于小型开采冶炼。目前，全省新式的小高炉已由解放前的三座增加到十九座。这种小高炉设备简单，日产五吨到二十五吨不等，所产的灰口生铁，可以作为近代工业铸造之用。此外，湖南省的土高炉、土砖炉的土生铁产量，解放以后也有增加。在1955年，有些土高炉因为产品积压和木炭来源困难，一部分停止生产了，但目前仍有土高炉二十五个，土砖炉七十九个。土高炉和土砖炉生产的白口生铁，可以做不要加工的铸件，例如锅、犁头等。白口生铁加工成熟铁以后，还可以用来作农具和农民日用铁制品。
    湖南省出产的生铁除供应本省农村及工矿企业以外，还将支援上海、广州等地的生产事业。
    据新华社合肥10日电　安徽省已经有一百九十九座炼铁炉投入生产。今年全省的土铁产量将由去年的三千多吨增加到两万吨。目前这些炼铁单位正在积极收购铁砂、木炭，做好原料和燃料的储备工作。很多炼土铁的单位还同农业社签订合同，收购农业社的铁砂、木炭。
    为了完成土铁生产计划，安徽省加强了对土铁生产的领导。中共六安地方各级党委成立了土铁生产的领导小组，由党委副书记亲自领导土铁生产。过去，各地的炼铁炉因为没有足够原料和燃料，一年只生产六、七个月，投入生产的炼铁炉也开炉不足。今年，土铁产区的有关部门将大力帮助农业社安排劳动力和正确地解决社员的分配收益问题，发挥农民淘铁砂、烧木炭的积极性，以保证炼铁炉得到足够的原料和燃料。这样，炼铁炉在一年内投入生产的时间，一般可以比过去延长两个月。
    新华社杭州10日电　浙江省今年争取生产土铁一万二千吨。这个数字比去年土铁实际产量增加三倍以上。今年生产的土铁，其中有七千吨是由各地土铁手工业生产社生产或由农业社作为副业生产的，其余五千吨将由今年新建的两个小高炉来完成。现在，在土铁主要产地云和县兴建的小型炼铁厂已经动工，5月份即可投入生产。
    浙江省土铁生产所需资源丰富。据不完全统计，全省铁矿石的蕴藏量有数千万吨；温州专区的蕴藏量最多，仅以这个专区的云和、青田两个县的统计，铁砂藏量就有五千多万吨。现在全省有七十四个熔炉，六十六个炼炉。但是过去生产技术很落后。今年浙江省手工业部门为了提高土铁的质量，除了新建的两个小高炉采用先进方法炼铁以外，在土铁手工业社和农业社的副业生产中，将通过交流经验提高技术水平。
    据新华社南京10日电　江苏省常州、无锡、苏州、徐州等地正在建造或准备建造小高炉，积极增加生铁产量。估计今年江苏省将出产生铁七千吨以上。
  江苏铁矿资源丰富，而且有冶炼生产的悠久历史，相传苏州在公元前五世纪就知道炼铁。吴越春秋中记载的：吴王阖闾叫干将炼铁铸剑，就是一个有名的炼铁的故事。（附图片）
