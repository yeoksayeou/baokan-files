Xinhua News Agency, 18th. 100,000 Beijing citizens rallied today to welcome Chairman Voroshilov.

At this welcoming rally, Chairman Mao Zedong led the 100,000 people in raising their arms and shouting: "Long live Comrade Voroshilov!" "Long live Soviet Comrades!" "Long live the Soviet People!" "Long live Soviet-Chinese Unity!"

This mass welcoming rally was held at the Temple of Agriculture Stadium.

At 2:55 PM, Chairman Voroshilov and Chairman Mao Zedong, Vice Chairman Zhu De, and Chairman Liu Shaoqi arrived at the Temple of Agriculture Stadium, where Premier Zhou Enlai and Mayor Peng Zhen greeted them at the entrance. At this moment, the 100,000 people inside and outside the stadium stood up and applauded enthusiastically. Chairman Voroshilov and Chairman Mao Zedong walked onto the podium hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder. As they walked, they smiled and waved to the crowd, or tipped their hats in greeting.

Today, the vice chairmen, vice premiers, and other national leaders in Beijing, vice chairmen of the National Committee of the CPPCC, and leaders of the CCP Central Committee, various democratic parties, and people's organizations all attended the welcoming rally.

Chairman Voroshilov delivered a speech at the welcoming rally. The head of this great ally appeared particularly excited and moved today. His voice was loud and became more powerful as he spoke.

In his speech, Chairman Voroshilov emphasized the unity of the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries. He said that the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries are united by brotherly friendship and close cooperation. Consolidating and developing the friendship and comprehensive cooperation between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, as well as other socialist countries, has been, is, and will be the cornerstone of the Soviet state's foreign policy. The Soviet Union will continue to provide selfless assistance to the People's Republic of China and all socialist countries in the future.

Chairman Voroshilov said that the Soviet people are watching with heartfelt joy the achievements of the Chinese people in socialist construction. The Chinese Communist Party creatively applied Marxism-Leninism in conjunction with China's specific realities. In the process of socialist construction, it found special forms for gradually incorporating private capitalist industry and commerce into the socialist orbit and for the cooperativization of agriculture. The experience accumulated by the People's Republic of China is a valuable contribution to the science of Marxism-Leninism.

He also said that now all strata of the People's Republic of China are firmly united into a harmonious big family, fully supporting the new social state system. This unity and support is the basic guarantee for the smooth development of the People's Republic of China in politics, economy, and culture.

Chairman Voroshilov's speech brought the joy of the meeting to one climax after another, with applause after applause and cheers after cheers.

When Chairman Voroshilov finished speaking, Chairman Mao Zedong embraced Chairman Voroshilov tightly. This was the third embrace between the heads of the two great countries, China and the Soviet Union, since they met in Beijing. The entire audience cheered enthusiastically for a long time for this moving scene that expressed the great friendship of the 800 million people.

Then, Vice Chairman Zhu De, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and Premier Zhou Enlai also stepped forward to shake hands with Chairman Voroshilov, thanking him for his friendly remarks. Chairman Voroshilov also embraced Mayor Peng Zhen.

Mayor Peng Zhen delivered a speech at the beginning of the rally, warmly welcoming Chairman Voroshilov and other Soviet guests. He said that the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is the basic guarantee for maintaining world peace and developing the cause of human progress. The Chinese people have learned many valuable things from the rich experience of the Soviet people in revolution and socialist construction. We will continue to strengthen the study of the Soviet Union's various advanced experiences in the future.

Mayor Peng Zhen said that the people of China and the Soviet Union are the closest comrades-in-arms and the most reliable comrades. Our two peoples will always work together with all peace-loving countries and peoples in the world to make the greatest efforts to maintain lasting world peace and the cause of human progress. He asked Comrade Voroshilov and other Soviet comrades to convey the sincere friendship of the Chinese people to the fraternal Soviet people.

After Chairman Voroshilov finished speaking, Mayor Peng Zhen presented him with a banner and gifts on behalf of the meeting, and the audience cheered and applauded enthusiastically for a long time.

After Chairman Voroshilov accepted the banner, he waved his hands and spoke again amidst the cheers of the crowd. He said: "The red flag you just presented to me symbolizes the ever-growing friendship and cooperation between the people of China and the Soviet Union. I am willing to assure you, and through you to the Chinese people, to the glorious Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government, and all the leading comrades headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, who are leading the Chinese people from victory to victory, that we have shed blood together in the past in order to let all people live a good life and enjoy happiness and freedom. We are willing to guarantee through this red flag today that we will cherish and constantly develop our friendship in the future. Long live the great Chinese people, the Chinese people who are creatively engaged in creative labor with genius and wisdom! Let all people rise up to fight for their happy lives and freedom, and rise up to oppose war. Long live world peace!"

At the end of Chairman Voroshilov's speech, Mayor Peng Zhen once again expressed his gratitude to him and other Soviet guests on behalf of the meeting and wished him longevity.

At this time, Chairman Voroshilov and Chairman Mao Zedong approached the center of the podium and waved to the cheering crowd. Chairman Mao Zedong led the 100,000 people in shouting slogans together.

Afterwards, Chairman Voroshilov and Chairman Mao Zedong walked to both ends of the podium and waved to the crowd in thanks.

After the distinguished guests left the venue, the band repeatedly played "Moscow-Beijing." The crowd standing in the center of the stadium turned to cheer and salute the Soviet friends in the stands, and countless hats and scarves were waved together in the stands and in the stadium. People cheered "Long live" and "Hurrah" together, and sang "Moscow-Beijing" along with the music. The song of friendship lingered in the air above the venue for a long time.

    伏罗希洛夫主席说，苏联人民怀着衷心喜悦的心情注视着中国人民在社会主义建设中的成就。中国共产党结合中国的具体实际，创造性地运用了马克思列宁主义。它在社会主义建设的进程中找到了把私人资本主义工商业逐渐纳入社会主义轨道和对农业进行合作化的特殊形式。中华人民共和国积累起来的经验是对马克思列宁主义科学的宝贵贡献。

    彭真市长在大会开始的时候致词，热烈欢迎伏罗希洛夫主席及其他苏联贵宾。他说，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，是维护世界和平和发展人类进步事业的基本保障。中国人民从苏联人民的革命和社会主义建设的丰富经验中学到了许多宝贵的东西，我们今后还要继续加强学习苏联的各种先进经验。
    彭真市长说，中苏两国人民是最亲密的战友和最可靠的同志，我们两国人民将永远同全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民一起，共同为维护世界持久和平和人类的进步事业尽最大的努力。他请伏罗希洛夫同志和其他苏联同志们把中国人民的真挚友谊带给兄弟的苏联人民。
    伏罗希洛夫主席讲话结束以后，彭真市长代表大会向他献旗献礼，场内热烈欢呼鼓掌，经久不息。
    伏罗希洛夫主席接受了锦旗以后，他又挥着双手在群众的欢呼声中讲了话。他说：“刚才你们赠送给我的这面红旗，象征着中苏两国人民友好合作永远地不断发展。我愿意向你们，并且通过你们向中国人民，向领导中国人民从胜利走向胜利的光荣的中国共产党、中国政府和以毛泽东同志为首的各位领导同志们保证：我们在过去为了让所有的人们过好日子，享受到幸福和自由而共同流过鲜血，我们愿意通过今天这面红旗来保证，在今后更加珍惜和不断发展我们之间的友谊。伟大的中国人民，天才智慧地从事着创造性劳动的中国人民万岁！让一切人们都起来为自己的幸福生活和自由而奋斗，都起来反对战争。世界和平万岁！”
    彭真市长在伏罗希洛夫主席讲话结束的时候，又代表大会向他及其他苏联贵宾表示感谢，并且祝他万寿无疆。

    随后，伏罗希洛夫主席和毛泽东主席又走到主席台的两端，向群众挥手答谢。
    在贵宾们离开会场以后，乐队反复地吹奏着“莫斯科—北京”。站在运动场中央的群众又转向看台上的苏联朋友们欢呼致意，看台上与场内无数的帽子和纱巾一齐挥舞。人们在一起欢呼着“万岁”和“乌拉”，又和着乐声唱起“莫斯科—北京”，友谊的歌声长久地缭绕在会场上空。
