Xinhua News Agency, Tangshan, 6th: The new ventilation shaft project at the Linxi Mine of the Kailuan Coal Mine, built with the assistance of the People's Republic of Poland, has been completed and a handover ceremony was held today.

At the handover meeting, Fan Wencai, Director of the General Bureau of Capital Construction of the Ministry of Coal Industry of China, presented the golden "Friendship" medals on behalf of Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council to the Polish experts and workers who helped China build the ventilation shaft. The workers of the Kailuan Coal Mine also presented silk banners to all members of the Polish drilling team. Weituomski, Commercial Counselor of the Polish Embassy in China, Bai Yun, Deputy Mayor of Tangshan, and others spoke at the meeting.

The ventilation shaft project at the Kailuan Coal Mine, specifically designed to send air underground, began construction in March 1954. Because the sinking of the ventilation shaft required passing through more than fifty meters of quicksand and an alluvial layer composed of sand, stone, and water, Chinese mine builders used two different drilling methods over more than a year, but failed to overcome the difficulty of drilling in an alluvial layer with a large amount of water inflow. In the second half of 1955, the People's Republic of Poland sent excellent experts and workers and brought a complete set of drilling equipment, using the world's advanced freezing method drilling technology for the first time in China to help build this ventilation shaft. Their tireless work, day and night, not only enabled the ventilation shaft to successfully pass through the alluvial layer but also completed the construction task five months ahead of schedule.

In the process of building the shaft, Polish experts and workers also trained a group of Chinese mine builders who can independently master the freezing method of construction.

    波兰帮助我开滦煤矿建成风井
    周总理赠“友谊”纪念章给波专家和工人
    据新华社唐山6日电　由波兰人民共和国帮助我国在开滦煤矿林西矿新建的风井工程已经完工，今天举行了建成移交仪式。
    在移交会上，中国煤炭工业部基本建设总局局长范文彩，代表国务院总理周恩来把金黄色的“友谊”纪念章赠给了帮助我国进行风井建设的波兰专家和工人。开滦煤矿的职工还向波兰打井队全体人员赠送了锦旗。波兰驻华大使馆商务专员魏托姆斯基、唐山市副市长白芸等，都在会上讲了话。
    在开滦煤矿建设的这个专门用以向井下送风的风井工程，是在1954年3月开工的。由于开凿风井要穿过五十多公尺的流沙以及沙石和水组成的冲积层地带，我国的矿井建设者先后使用过两种打井方法花费了一年多的时间，都没有战胜在涌水量很大的冲积层打井的困难。1955年下半年，波兰人民共和国派来了优秀的专家和工人并且带来了全套打井设备，在我国第一次运用世界上先进的冻结法打井技术，帮助建设这个风井。他们夜以继日的辛勤劳动，不但使这个风井顺利地通过了冲积层地带，还提前五个月完成了施工任务。
    在建井过程中，波兰专家和工人们，还为中国培养出一批能够独立掌握冻结法施工的矿井建设者。
