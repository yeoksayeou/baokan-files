Xinhua News Agency, April 28th: Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his wife hosted a banquet this evening to welcome Speaker of the Burmese Chamber of Nationalities, Sao Hkun Hkio, and his wife.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi delivered a speech, welcoming the Burmese guests to China. He said that the people of China and Burma have had friendly exchanges since a long time ago, and this friendly exchange has seen new developments in recent years.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi said that the frequent contact and friendly exchanges between the leaders of China and Burma recently have further enhanced mutual understanding and friendship, laying a new foundation for a fair and reasonable solution to the problems left over from history between our two countries. Just as the Burmese people treat the Chinese people, the Chinese people have always regarded the peace-loving Burmese people as close brothers in the common struggle against colonialism and in safeguarding peace in Asia and the world. This sincere feeling and friendship naturally allows us to gather here as intimately as family members reuniting after a long separation. There is no doubt that this feeling and friendship will continue to develop not only in our generation, but also in the generation representing the bright future of the Chinese and Burmese people - the youth and children.

Speaker Sao Hkun Hkio expressed his gratitude in his speech. He said that Burma and China are neighbors, and the two countries share a long border. Many of the people on both sides of the border belong to the same ethnic group, and some are even relatives. After Burma's independence and China's liberation, the relationship between the two countries became even more friendly, and the mutual visits of the two countries' prime ministers were like those of close brothers.

Speaker Sao Hkun Hkio said that he gained a deep impression from this visit to China.

During the banquet, the hosts and guests repeatedly stood up and toasted to the eternal friendship between the people of China and Burma, to the prosperity and strength of the two countries, and to lasting peace in Asia and the world.

Also present at the banquet tonight were Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Li Jishen and Huang Yanpei, as well as members, deputy secretaries-general, and heads of various institutions under the National People's Congress, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, heads of the Sino-Burmese Friendship Association, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the Buddhist Association of China, and the Counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Burma, among others.

The wife of the Burmese Ambassador to China, as well as Chargé d'Affaires U Ba Maung and his wife, were also invited to attend. (Attached photo)

    刘少奇委员长欢宴萧恢塔议长
    新华社28日讯　刘少奇委员长和夫人在今晚设宴欢迎缅甸民族院议长萧恢塔和夫人。
    刘少奇委员长致词，对缅甸客人来中国访问表示欢迎。他说，中缅两国人民在历史上很早就开始了友好往来，这种友好往来在最近几年有了新的发展。
    刘少奇委员长说，最近中缅两国领导人员的频繁接触和友好往来更进一步增进了相互的了解和友谊。为公平合理地解决我们两国之间历史上遗留的问题打下了新的基础。如同缅甸人民对待中国人民一样，中国人民一直把爱好和平的缅甸人民作为共同反对殖民主义、维护亚洲和世界和平的亲密的兄弟。这种真挚的感情和友谊，很自然地使我们能够在这里像久别重逢的家里人一样亲密无间地欢叙一堂。毫无疑问，这种感情和友谊，不仅在我们这一代，而且还在代表中、缅人民光辉的未来——青年少年们这一代中不断地发展。
    萧恢塔议长致词表示感谢。他说，缅甸和中国是邻居，两国毗邻的边界很长。在边界两旁的人民有很多是属于同一个民族的，有的还是亲戚。在缅甸独立和中国解放后，两国的关系更加友好，两国总理的相互来往像亲兄弟一样。
    萧恢塔议长说，他这次访问中国获得了深刻的印象。
    席间，宾主一再起立，为中缅两国人民的永恒友谊，为两国的繁荣和富强，为亚洲和世界的持久和平而干杯。
    出席今晚宴会的，有全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长李济深、黄炎培和委员、副秘书长以及全国人民代表大会所属各机构负责人，外交部副部长章汉夫，中缅友好协会、中华全国民主妇女联合会、中国佛教协会的负责人，中国驻缅甸大使馆参赞等。
    缅甸驻中国大使的夫人以及大使馆临时代办吴巴茂和夫人也应邀出席。（附图片）
