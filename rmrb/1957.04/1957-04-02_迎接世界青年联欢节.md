Welcoming the World Youth Festival

	Roads Lead to Moscow
	To commemorate the World Youth Festival in Moscow, young people from various countries will hold a large-scale "Peace and Friendship Relay Race" before the festival. According to recent news, young athletes will carry the baton from six routes through more than twenty countries to Moscow. The first route goes from Denmark through Norway, Sweden, Finland to the Soviet Union. The second route goes from the United Kingdom through France, Switzerland, Austria, Czechoslovakia to the Soviet Union. The third route goes from Italy through Austria, Hungary to the Soviet Union. The fourth route goes from Greece through Bulgaria, Romania to the Soviet Union. The fifth route goes from the Netherlands through Belgium, Luxembourg, France, West Germany, East Germany, Poland to the Soviet Union. The sixth route goes from Korea through China, Mongolia to the Soviet Union. In addition to the above countries, young people from many countries in Asia, Latin America, and Africa will hold relay races in their own countries, and then their delegations will bring the batons to Moscow.
	Flowers Everywhere Welcome Guests
	During the festival, there will be as many as 350 to 400 activities every day. If these programs are listed in detail, they can be compiled into a book of more than 60 pages. The representatives participating in the festival will be housed in the dormitories of fifty-three hotels and schools, and more than two thousand buses will be available for the representatives to use. To celebrate the festival, people will plant more than eight million flowers and plants. At that time, Moscow will welcome the arrival of young people from all over the world with tulips, peonies, and roses in full bloom.
	Hundreds of Thousands Prepare to Sing and Dance
	The youth of Moscow's factories and schools are enthusiastically preparing cultural programs for street and square performances during the festival. According to incomplete statistics, no less than 200,000 people in Moscow participate in amateur cultural activities. Singing, dancing, and recitation activities can be seen everywhere in cultural palaces and clubs. They are also learning foreign dances and songs, and many workers' entertainment groups are learning Chinese waist drum dances.
	A Wide Variety of Souvenirs
	Young people from all over the Soviet Union are carefully making various gifts and souvenirs to be distributed to foreign guests coming to Moscow during the festival. Artists, students, and workers actively participated in the design of souvenirs and gifts. A female artist made a Gothic paper fan consisting of five petals. This paper fan can be transformed into a hat, handbag, sun visor, mask, etc. with just a shake. The Fifth Arts and Crafts School of the Black Sea Region of Ukraine used twenty-seven kinds of local wood to make a relief. At the same time, various world-renowned handicrafts are being rushed to produce, such as Uzbek embroidery, Baltic fur products, and wooden toys from the suburbs of Moscow. A gift exhibition was held in Moscow not long ago, exhibiting various exquisite gifts and souvenirs, with more than 750 styles. (Attached picture)

    迎接世界青年联欢节
    条条道路通莫斯科
    为了纪念在莫斯科举行的世界青年联欢节，各国青年将在联欢节之前举行一次大规模的“和平友谊接力赛跑”。据最近的消息，青年运动员们将带着接力棒从六条路线通过二十多个国家跑到莫斯科。第一条路线从丹麦经过挪威、瑞典、芬兰到苏联。第二条路线从英国经过法国、瑞士、奥地利、捷克斯洛伐克到达苏联。第三条路线从意大利经过奥地利、匈牙利到达苏联。第四条路线从希腊经过保加利亚、罗马尼亚到达苏联。第五条路线从荷兰经过比利时、卢森堡、法国、西德、民主德国、波兰到达苏联。第六条路线从朝鲜经过中国、蒙古到达苏联。除了上述国家外，亚洲、拉丁美洲、非洲许多国家青年将在本国举行接力赛，然后由他们的代表团把接力棒带来莫斯科。
    遍地鲜花迎嘉宾
    联欢节期间，每天的活动有三百五十种到四百种之多，如果把这些节目都详细列举出来，可以编成一本六十多页厚的书。参加联欢节的代表将分住在五十三个旅馆和学校的宿舍里，有两千多辆公共汽车供代表们使用。为了庆祝联欢节，人们将栽植八百多万株花草。到那时，莫斯科将以遍地盛开的郁金香、芍药、玫瑰花来迎接各国青年们的到来。
    几十万人准备歌舞
    莫斯科的工厂和学校的青年正在热情地准备文艺节目，以便联欢节期间在街头和广场表演。据不完全的统计，莫斯科参加业余文娱活动的不下二十万人。在文化宫和俱乐部里到处可以看到练习歌唱、舞蹈、朗诵的活动，他们还在学习外国的舞蹈和歌曲，许多工人文娱小组在学习中国的腰鼓舞。
    纪念物品  花样繁多
    苏联各地的青年正在精心制作各式礼品、纪念品，以便在联欢节时分送给来莫斯科的外国客人。艺术家、学生和工人积极参加了纪念品和礼品的设计工作。一个女艺术家作了一种由五个花瓣组成的哥特的纸扇。这个纸扇只要一抖动即可变成帽子、手提包、遮太阳的帽檐、面具等。乌克兰黑海区第五工艺学校利用二十七种地方木材制作了一个浮雕。同时，各地在赶制在世界上负有盛名的各种工艺品，如乌兹别克的刺绣、波罗的海地区的皮毛制品，莫斯科近郊的木制玩具等。不久前在莫斯科举办了一个礼品展览会，展出各种精美礼品和纪念品，式样达七百五十多种。（附图片）
