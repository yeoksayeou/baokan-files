    A Spark that Ignites a Prairie Fire
    ——On the Film "Eagle in the Storm"
    Li Shaobai　Xie Fengsong
    On the boundless grasslands of Qinghai, a dozen Red Army soldiers, escorted by the enemy, are on the march. They are the soldiers who were captured by the enemy after covering the retreat of the main force of the Red Army during the Long March. Unwilling to accept their fate, they finally cut their ropes during a storm, escaped from the clutches of the enemy, and ignited the flames of revolutionary struggle among the Tibetan people on this plateau... The authors have chosen such a novel subject, enthusiastically praising the Red Army soldiers who persisted in revolutionary struggle and were unyielding, praising the heroic and upright Tibetan people, and also praising the deep friendship they forged in battle.
    "Eagle in the Storm" is not only the first film to touch on the heroic deeds of the Red Army's Long March, but it also portrays the images of several Red Army soldiers relatively successfully. In depicting the images and struggles of minority peoples, it has also broken free from old conventions.
    The Red Army soldiers in the film appear to be ordinary people, but within the characters of these ordinary people, there shines a dazzling light. The authors did not endow them with any external charm, but rather tried to reveal the nobility of their hearts. From the beginning of the film, the indomitable will of these Red Army soldiers is displayed. Despite the enemy's harsh whipping of the soldier who appears to be a child, he bravely endures it in order to divert the enemy's attention from the dropped sickle. From their tenacious expressions and indignant gazes, people glimpse the power within them. The film further depicts the image of the Red Army soldiers in a moving way in the scene where the Red Army meets the Tibetan hunter, old Ba'er. In front of the people, they are so understanding and reasonable, so approachable. In them, we see the brilliance of the revolutionary army's strict discipline and the idea of fighting for the poor masses. Having just escaped from the enemy's escort, hungry and thirsty, how much they need food! They unexpectedly discover a roe deer and are overjoyed, but when they see the snare on the deer's leg, they hesitate; the snare indicates that this deer is already the property of the hunter, "It cannot be eaten, the discipline of the revolutionary army cannot be violated," so they put the deer down again. This noble act not only moves old Ba'er, but also moves the audience. This is the traditional style of the revolutionary army, and it is also its essence. The authors have consistently threaded this red line through these Red Army soldiers, in their actions, from beginning to end. They always think of the people, serve the people, fight for the interests of the people, and are happy to dedicate everything to the happiness of the people... This is precisely the guarantee that they can achieve victory in battle in this seemingly weak and isolated situation, and it is the reason why they can ignite the flames of revolution in this seemingly unfamiliar place. In the end, these Red Army soldiers sacrificed their young lives for the safe retreat of the Tibetan people. This is a deeply moving scene: under the strong pressure of the enemy, the Tibetan people have to make the decision to retreat to the other side of the Yellow River, and the Red Army soldiers undertake the task of covering this retreat. They fight to the last person, to the last bullet; when they throw the last grenade at the swarming enemy, they shout: "You can't catch up!" and then jump off the cliff. Their heroic spirit, the great spirit of self-sacrifice, deeply moves us. In those days of arduous struggle, how many such nameless heroes sacrificed their lives for the revolution and for the people. They truly had "bones of iron" and a "heart of gold." The ending of the film powerfully expresses the people's belief in the future victory. The red star given by the instructor to the Tibetan people symbolizes that the flame of revolution has not been extinguished, and it will continue to burn... Here, the film does not give people a feeling of depression, but rather a huge force of encouragement.
    The images of the Tibetan people in the film are also depicted relatively well. The authors have done a good job of revealing the characteristics of their characters. Old Ba'er, this is a shrewd, strong, and humorous old man. He has a heart like a bright pearl, pure and kind, but also resolute and brave. Personal experience and real life have made him deeply understand the disasters that the Kuomintang rule has brought to the Tibetan people; therefore, he can, from the comparison, establish a firm belief in protecting these Red Army soldiers. He has a clear ability to distinguish enemies outside the nation, but he is not good at finding and dealing with enemies within the nation. The authors' treatment of this is very moving, showing the character and true feelings of this Tibetan old man. Hua'erdan, as a representative of the younger generation of Tibetans, is different from his father. He does not have his father's calmness and sophistication, nor does he have the experience and strategies to fight against the enemy, and these shortcomings are intertwined with his fiery personality, brave spirit, and incomparable hatred for the enemy, so his image does not feel conceptualized or simplified.
    On the other hand, there are still some aspects of the creation of these images that are worth discussing. First of all, we feel that old Ba'er's image still lacks a more sufficient basis in character. What made this Tibetan old man so confident in these Red Army soldiers from the beginning, so caring and friendly to them, to the point that later, the people of the entire Tibetan tribe could fight against the Kuomintang army together with the Red Army? Of course, the authors depicted the Red Army soldiers not taking old Ba'er's roe deer, the Kuomintang army killing the tribal head, etc., but we still feel that old Ba'er's reasons for firmly believing in the Red Army soldiers are insufficient, and the basis for the broad masses of Tibetan people fighting against the Kuomintang army together with the Red Army soldiers is insufficient (the film fails to show the mass scope of the event). The main reason here, we feel, is that the authors failed to depict the historical and real relationship between the Red Army and old Ba'er and the Tibetan people here more fully, more carefully, and more credibly.
    In real life, after the Red Army's Long March in 1935, there were people in the Tibetan tribes like old Ba'er who firmly believed in the Communist Party and the Red Army soldiers. There is no doubt about this. The problem lies in the environment in which the character is produced as depicted in the work. It now seems that the environment chosen by the film seems to be a Tibetan tribe that has not been affected by the Long March. The authors did not deliberately express the good impression of the Tibetan people on the Red Army; even old Ba'er, Hua'erdan, and others seem to know little about the Red Army. Moreover, the several Red Army soldiers only have contact with old Ba'er's family, and it seems that they have no relationship with the other people in the tribe, which will invisibly weaken the persuasiveness of the image. We believe that it is reasonable and proper for the film to choose an environment that is deeply imprinted with the footprints of the Long March. If so, the film's atmosphere of the times would be stronger, the characters would be more real, and the ideas expressed would be more profound.
    In addition, we feel that because the authors failed to better reveal the relationship between the Red Army soldiers, as well as their relationship with the Tibetan people, the images of several Red Army soldiers are not lively and fleshed out enough. The several Red Army soldiers now standing before us, besides their heroic essence, we know little about them. We cannot see the individual differences between them and the inner state of each of them at that time. The authors rarely emphasize their individual characteristics; there is also a lack of due description of their thoughts and feelings at that time. There is a point in the screenplay about this, that is, when Zhang Dashun saw the roe deer, he said: This not only brings food, but also travel expenses. Because the musk deer can be sold for travel expenses. This reveals their desire to catch up with their own troops very well, and it is helpful for characterization, but unfortunately, this only point was also deleted during the shooting process.
    But we still think this is a good film, it has a novel theme, moving artistic images and ideological power. It will be welcomed by our youth and the broad masses of the audience. (Attached picture)

    燎原的星火
    ——谈影片“暴风中的雄鹰”
    李少白　谢逢松
    在无际的青海大草原上，走着十几个被敌人押解着的红军战士，他们是掩护红军长征主力部队撤走后而被敌人俘获的。他们不甘心于自己的处境，终于在一次风暴里，割开绳索，从敌人的魔掌里逃脱出来，并在这高原的藏族人民当中，点燃了革命斗争的火焰……作者选取了这样一个新颖的题材，热情地歌颂了坚持革命斗争的、不屈不挠的红军战士，歌颂了英勇正直的藏族人民，也歌颂了他们在战斗中结成的深厚友谊。
    “暴风中的雄鹰”不仅是第一部触及红军万里长征英雄事迹的影片，而且还比较成功地刻划了几个红军战士的形象。在描绘少数民族人民的形象和斗争方面，也脱出了老套。
    影片里的红军战士，看来是些普通的人，但是，在这些普通的人的性格里，却闪烁着耀眼的光辉。作者没有赋与他们任何外在的魅力，而是极力揭示出他们的心灵的崇高。影片开始，就展示出这几个红军战士的不屈意志。尽管敌人用鞭子狠狠地抽打那个看来还是孩子的战士，但是为了引开敌人对掉下来的镰刀的注目，他却坚强地忍受着。从他们那顽强的神情和激愤的目光里，人们窥见了他们内心的力量。影片在表现红军和藏族猎人老巴尔相见那场戏里，对红军战士的形象进一步作了动人的描绘。在人民面前，他们是那样地知情知理，那样地平易近人。在他们身上我们看到了革命军队的严守纪律、为穷苦大众而战的思想的光辉。刚从敌人押解下逃脱出来，又饥又渴，他们多么需要食物！他们意外地发现一只獐子，兴奋若狂，但是，当看到獐子腿上的套子的时候，他们犹豫了；套子表明这只獐子已经是猎人的财物，“不能吃，不能破坏革命军队的纪律”，于是他们又把獐子放了下来。这种崇高的行为，不仅感动了老巴尔，也感动了观众。这是革命军队的传统作风，也是它的本质。作者在这几个红军战士身上，在他们的行动中，自始至终贯串了这条红线，他们处处为人民着想，为人民服务，为人民的利益而战斗，为人民的幸福而乐于献出自己的一切……这正是他们能在这看来力量单薄而孤立的情况下取得战斗胜利的保证，是他们能在这看来人生地疏的地方点燃革命火焰的原因。最后，这些红军战士为了藏族人民的安全撤退，献出了自己年青的生命。这是一场感人至深的戏：在敌人强大的压力下，藏族人民不得不作出撤退到黄河对岸的决定，红军战士担任了这次撤退的掩护工作。他们打到最后一个人、打到最后一颗子弹；当他们向那蜂拥而上的敌人扔出最后一颗手榴弹的时候，他们高喊：“你们追不上了！”随即跳到那万丈悬崖之下。他们的英雄气概，自我牺牲的伟大精神，使我们为之深深感动。在那些艰苦斗争的日子里，有多少这样的无名英雄，为革命、为人民献出了生命。他们确实有一副“铁打的骨头”，有一颗“黄金的心”。影片的结尾，有力地表达了人民对未来的胜利的信念。指导员给藏族人民的那颗红星，象征着革命的火焰并没有熄灭，它将继续燃烧下去……在这里影片给人的不是消沉的感觉，而是巨大的鼓舞力量。
    影片里的藏族人民的形象，也是描写得比较好的。作者很好地揭示了他们性格里的特征。老巴尔，这是一个精明、强悍、风趣的老人。他有一颗明珠似的心，纯朴、善良，但也是刚毅勇敢的。亲身的经历，现实的生活，使他深深地懂得国民党的统治给藏族带来的灾难；因此，他能从对比中，给自己树立一个坚决保护这几个红军战士的信念。他对民族外部的敌人，具有清晰的辨别能力，但是，他还不善于找出和对待民族内部的敌人。作者这样的处理，十分动人地显示了这个藏族老人的性格和真实心情。作为代表藏族青年一代的华尔丹，则与父亲不同。他没有父亲那种沉着和老练，也还缺乏对敌斗争的经验和策略，而这些不足的方面又是和他那火热的个性、勇敢的精神和对敌人的无比憎恨交织在一起的，因而他的形象也不觉得概念化、简单化。
    另一方面，上述这些形象的创造，也还有一些值得商榷的地方。首先，我们觉得老巴尔的形象还缺乏更充分的性格依据。是什么使这个藏族老人一开始就对这几个红军战士坚信不疑，对他们那样照护和友好，以至到后来，整个藏族部落的人民都能和红军一起对国民党军队展开了战斗呢？当然，作者对红军战士没有拿取老巴尔的獐子，国民党军队打死了部落头人等等作了描写，但是，我们仍然感到老巴尔坚决相信红军战士的理由不足，感到广大藏族群众和红军战士一起对国民党军队展开战斗的依据不足（影片没能展示出事件的群众范围）。这里的主要原因，我们觉得是作者没能更充分、更细致、更可信地描绘出红军同老巴尔和这里的藏族人民群众的历史的、现实的关系。
    在实际生活里，1935年红军长征之后，藏族部落中，是有像老巴尔这样坚信共产党、坚信红军战士的人存在的。这是无可怀疑的。问题在于作品所描写的产生性格的环境。现在看来，影片所选择的环境似乎是一个没有受到长征影响的藏族部落。作者没有有意去表现藏族人民群众对红军的良好印象；即使是老巴尔、华尔丹等人，对红军似乎也是知道得不多的。而且几个红军战士也只和老巴尔一家人有联系，和部落的其他人好像就没有什么关系了，这样，无形中会削弱了形象的说服力。我们认为，影片选择一个深印长征足迹的环境，是合理而应当的。如果那样，影片的时代气氛会更浓厚些，人物形象会更真实些，所表达的思想也会更深刻些。
    另外，我们觉得，由于作者没能更好地揭示出红军战士之间的关系，以及他们和藏族人民的关系，因而使得几个红军战士的形象也不够生动和血肉丰满。现在站在我们面前的几个红军战士，除了他们的英雄本质之外，我们就对他们知道得不多了。我们看不清他们之间的个性区别和他们每个人当时的内心状态。作者，很少去强调他们的个人特征；对他们当时的思想感情也缺乏应有的描写。电影文学剧本有一点是关于这方面的描写的，就是张大顺在看见獐子的时候说：这不仅送来了吃的，还外带了盘缠。因为麝香一卖就是盘缠了。这里很好地揭示出他们要赶上自己部队的心情，是有助于人物刻划的，可惜，仅有的这一点，也在拍摄过程中被删掉了。
    但是我们仍然认为这是一部好的影片，它有新颖的题材，感人的艺术形象和思想力量。它会受到我国青年和广大观众的欢迎。（附图片）
