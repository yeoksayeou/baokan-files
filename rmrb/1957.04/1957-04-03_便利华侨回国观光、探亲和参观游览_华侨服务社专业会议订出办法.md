Xinhua News Agency, 2nd: To discuss how to further facilitate overseas Chinese returning to China for sightseeing, visiting relatives, and touring, the Overseas Chinese Service Agency held an eight-day professional conference in Beijing at the end of March.

The conference heard reports from representatives from various regions on the work of receiving overseas Chinese in the past year, and discussed and formulated the Articles of Association of the Overseas Chinese Service Agency, the Organizational Methods for Overseas Chinese Tourist Groups, and the Methods for Receiving Individual Self-Funded Overseas Chinese Tourists and Hong Kong and Macao Compatriots.

The conference decided that in the future, the names of service agencies in various regions will be uniformly called "Overseas Chinese Travel Service," prefixed with the local place name; a unified leading organization will be established in Beijing - the Head Office of Overseas Chinese Travel Service.

The business scope of the Overseas Chinese Travel Service is: introducing places of interest and historical sites in various regions and guiding tours and visits; organizing and contracting travel tours in major cities across the country and dispatching personnel to accompany and guide; introducing and booking hotels, and assisting in solving food problems; booking domestic train, plane, and ship tickets, international through transport tickets, and renting urban transportation vehicles; handling the extraction, storage, consignment, and mailing of luggage and parcels; handling bank withdrawals, remittances, and deposits; sending domestic and international telegrams and long-distance calls; assisting and guiding in handling visa procedures for going abroad and passing through Hong Kong; arranging appointments with relatives and friends, and forwarding gifts, etc. The service agencies in Guangdong and Fujian provinces also handle the escort of relatives of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese entering and leaving the country, and the business of overseas Chinese returning to China to visit relatives.

The charging standard of the Overseas Chinese Travel Service is "taken from overseas Chinese and used for overseas Chinese," and not for the purpose of making profits, so it is different from purely business-oriented departments.

Overseas Chinese service agencies in various regions were established before last year's National Day, and the overseas Chinese service agencies in Guangdong and Fujian provinces were established the year before last. At present, there are 35 Overseas Chinese Travel Service agencies (stations) nationwide. In addition to the establishment of service agencies in major cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Kunming, Suzhou, Wuxi, Nanjing, Wuhan, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Chengdu, Dalian, and Xiamen, key overseas Chinese hometown counties and towns have overseas Chinese travel service stations. Last year alone, the Guangdong Overseas Chinese Service Agency handled entry and exit procedures for thousands of overseas Chinese and received 3,000 overseas Chinese tourist groups returning to China, and the Beijing Overseas Chinese Service Agency received 2,500 overseas Chinese tourist groups.

    便利华侨回国观光、探亲和参观游览
    华侨服务社专业会议订出办法
    新华社2日讯　为了讨论如何进一步便利华侨回国观光、探亲和参观游览，华侨服务社于3月底在北京举行了八天的专业会议。
    会议听取了各地代表介绍的过去一年来接待华侨工作的情况，讨论并制定了华侨服务社组织条例、华侨旅行团组织办法和接待个别自费旅行华侨及港澳同胞办法。
    会议决定，今后各地服务社的名称统一称为“华侨旅行服务社”，并冠以当地地名；在北京设立统一的领导机构——华侨旅行服务社总社。
    华侨旅行服务社的业务范围是：介绍各地名胜古迹并指导游览参观；组织和承包国内各大城市的旅行游览并派员陪同向导；介绍和代订旅馆、协助解决膳食问题；代订购国内火车、飞机、轮船客票，国际联运客票及租赁市内交通车辆；代办提取、保管、托运行李包裹和邮寄包裹；代办银行取款、汇款和存款；代发国内外电报及长途电话；协助及指导办理出国和过港签证手续；代约会亲友，转赠物品等。广东、福建两省的服务社还兼办侨眷、归侨出入国的沿途护送和华侨回国探亲的业务。
    华侨旅行服务社的收费标准是“取之于华侨，用之于华侨”，而不以营利为目的，因此与纯粹企业部门性质有所不同。
    各地华侨服务社是去年国庆节前成立的，广东省和福建省的华侨服务社是前年成立的。目前全国各地共设有华侨旅行服务社（站）三十五处。除北京、天津、上海、杭州、昆明、苏州、无锡、南京、武汉、沈阳、广州、重庆、成都、大连、厦门等各大中城市设立服务社外，重点侨乡县、镇都设有华侨旅行服务站。去年仅广东省华侨服务社就为数千华侨办理了出入国手续，接待了华侨回国观光团三千人，北京华侨服务社接待华侨观光团二千五百人。
