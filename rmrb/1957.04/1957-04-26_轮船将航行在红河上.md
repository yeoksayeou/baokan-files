    Steamships to Navigate the Red River
    The first shallow-water tugboat waterway in Yunnan Province has appeared. This waterway is located on the lower reaches of the Red River, between Hekou County and Manhao Ferry, and is approximately 110 kilometers long.
    Beginning in early January of this year, more than 1,000 farmers of various ethnic groups from both banks of the Red River blasted parts of twelve dangerous shoals, including Kuzhuyi, that hindered ship navigation in the lower reaches of the Red River, cleared reefs in the river, and built eight training walls and groynes. The final construction work is now underway.
    Currently, preparations for opening the waterway are actively underway. A shallow-water tugboat has been transported from Tianjin to Hekou, and three wooden barges have been built, waiting only for the end of the Red River dry season and the subsequent rise in water level to begin trial voyages.
    In the past, only small wooden boats could navigate the lower reaches of the Red River. When wooden boats passed through the shoals, the goods on board had to be carried onto the shore, and then carried back onto the boat after it passed through the shoals, which was very inconvenient. The lower reaches of the Red River are rich in rice and subtropical fruits. Previously, it was difficult to transport these goods out. These conditions will all be changed after the shallow-water steamship waterway is opened to navigation. (Xinhua News Agency)

    轮船将航行在红河上
    云南省内出现了第一条浅水拖轮航道。这条航道在红河下游的河口县到曼耗渡口之间，长约一百一十公里。
    从今年1月初开始，一千多名来自红河两岸的各族农民，在红河下游炸掉了苦竹邑等十二座险滩中阻碍轮船通航的部分，清除了河中礁石，又修筑了八座顺坝和丁坝。现在正在进行结尾工程施工。
    目前，筹备通航的工作正在积极进行。一支浅水拖轮已经由天津运到河口，三只木驳船已经制好，只等红河枯水季节一过，水位上升以后就要试航。
    过去，红河下游只能通行小木船。木船过滩的时候，舟中货物需要搬在滩上，船过滩以后再搬上船去，十分不便。红河下游两岸盛产稻米和亚热带水果。以前这些东西很难外运。浅水轮船航道通航以后，这些状况都将得到改变。　（新华社）
