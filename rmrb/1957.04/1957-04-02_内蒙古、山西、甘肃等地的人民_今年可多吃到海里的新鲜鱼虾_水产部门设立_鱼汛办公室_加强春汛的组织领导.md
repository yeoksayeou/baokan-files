    The People of Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Gansu and Other Places
    Will Be Able to Eat More Fresh Fish and Shrimp from the Sea This Year
    Aquatic Product Departments Set Up "Fishing Season Office" to Strengthen the Organization and Leadership of the Spring Fishing Season
    (Our newspaper dispatch) The peak season for fishery production in various parts of our country has begun. According to the production situation in previous years, the output in the first half of the year accounts for about 55% of the total annual output, with marine fish production being the main component. Therefore, the spring fishing season is crucial to completing the annual task.
    The aquatic product departments have decided to strengthen the organization and leadership of the fishing season production in various regions in order to fully prepare for the spring fishing season and promptly grasp and resolve important issues that arise during the fishing season. In mid-March, the Ministry of Aquatic Products dispatched five central work groups to the East China Sea area, Bohai Sea area, South China Sea area, as well as Hubei and Anhui fish fry production areas to assist in the work. A Fishing Season Office was also specifically established within the ministry to strengthen contact with fishing areas across the country and grasp the overall production and sales situation.
    According to the current situation, the materials needed for spring fishing season production have generally been resolved thanks to the strong support of relevant departments and the efforts of various regions. This provides a guarantee for fishermen to go to sea in a timely manner and complete the spring fishing season production tasks.
    In terms of product transportation and sales, for areas where fish catches are highly concentrated but transportation is inconvenient, aquatic product departments are currently devising measures to prevent fish spoilage during the spring fishing season.
    The railway department will also allocate hundreds of refrigerated cars and vehicles for transporting fish fry during the spring fishing season to meet the needs of areas such as Yantai, Qingdao, Tianjin, and Wuhan. It is estimated that railway transportation of aquatic products will reach more than 2,400 carriages in the second quarter of this year, a doubling of the transportation volume compared to the same period last year. The transportation departments' sea, land, and inland river transportation are also strongly supporting the spring fishing season production. Therefore, the people of Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Gansu, and other places far from the sea can eat fresh fish and shrimp more conveniently and earlier this year than last year. (Liu Xingxi)

    内蒙古、山西、甘肃等地的人民
    今年可多吃到海里的新鲜鱼虾
    水产部门设立“鱼汛办公室”加强春汛的组织领导
    本报讯　我国各地渔业旺产季节已经开始。根据历年的生产情况，上半年的产量占全年总产量的55％左右，其中主要的又是海水鱼的生产。因此，春汛大生产是关系到能否完成全年任务的关键。
    水产部门决定加强各地渔汛生产的组织领导，以便充分做好春汛前的各项生产准备工作，及时掌握和解决渔汛中产生的重要问题。3月中旬，水产部即派出东海区、渤海区、南海区以及湖北、安徽鱼苗产区五个中央工作组出发各地，帮助工作。并在部内专门成立了渔汛办公室，以加强同全国各渔区的联系，掌握全面的产销情况。
    根据目前情况来看：春汛生产中需用的物资，经有关部门大力支持和各地的努力，一般都得到了解决。这给渔民及时出海，完成春汛生产任务提供了保证。
    在产品运销上，对于鱼货高度集中同时运输又不方便的地区，水产部门现正设法采取措施以防止发生春汛期间鱼货腐烂的现象。
    铁道部门也将在春汛期间调配数百辆冷藏车和运输鱼苗的车辆，供给烟台、青岛、天津、武汉等地区的需要。预计今年第二季度铁路运输水产将达二千四百多个车箱，比去年同期运输量增加一倍。交通部门的海运、陆运、内河航运也以大力支援春汛大生产。所以，今年离海较远的内蒙古、山西、甘肃等地的人民，都可以比去年更便利和更早地吃到新鲜鱼虾。　（刘兴喜）
