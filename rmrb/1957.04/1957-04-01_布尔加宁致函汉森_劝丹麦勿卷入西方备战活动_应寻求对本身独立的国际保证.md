Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 31st: TASS reports from Moscow on March 31st: Moscow newspapers published a letter from the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, to the Danish Prime Minister, Hansen.

In his letter, Bulganin addressed the war preparations of the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, stating that these war preparations are not only dangerous to the countries that might be victimized but also equally dangerous to the countries participating in these preparations themselves, especially those European countries within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization that are being used as outposts and offensive bases.

Bulganin said that the leaders of the North Atlantic group are very interested in Danish territory, mainly because the organization's command sees Danish territory as a position to control access to and from the Baltic Sea. Greenland, which belongs to Denmark, has long been turned into an American military base, and is virtually beyond Danish jurisdiction. The European part of Danish territory is covered with military airfields and naval bases built according to the plans of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization command. There are American and British instructors in Danish military bases and troops. Naturally, under such circumstances, there is no guarantee that, at the command of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization headquarters, foreign armed forces will not appear within hours at Danish military bases, ready to be used against peace-loving countries. If the plan to station American special forces equipped with atomic weapons in Denmark is realized, the situation will undoubtedly worsen.

Bulganin said that it is a very serious and improper adventure for Denmark to involve itself in the military preparations of certain countries. If the Soviet government did not take urgent measures to counter aggression by delivering devastating blows to the aggressors and the entire network of bases used to attack the Soviet Union, it would not be responsible to the Soviet people. The destructive power of modern weapons is enormous; for a country with a territory the size of Denmark, providing foreign bases is tantamount to suicide in the event of an atomic war.

Bulganin said that if all necessary measures are not taken to eliminate the threat of war in the face of the terrible consequences that a new war might bring, the people of all countries will not forgive their governments. He hoped that the Danish government would give due attention to the Soviet Union's proposals on European collective security and contribute to exploring concrete ways acceptable to all parties concerned. Before an effective European collective security system is established, Denmark can seek ways to solve its own security problems, such as seeking international guarantees for its independence and territorial integrity.

Bulganin finally pointed out that there is a rare and long-standing foundation of friendship between the Soviet Union and Denmark. Last year's meeting between the leaders of the Soviet government and the leaders of the Danish government opened up new prospects for expanding cooperation between the two peoples. However, the possibilities for developing such ties have not yet been fully utilized. There is no doubt that these ties can be further developed by strengthening trust and cooperation between the two countries.

### 布尔加宁致函汉森  劝丹麦勿卷入西方备战活动  应寻求对本身独立的国际保证

    布尔加宁致函汉森
    劝丹麦勿卷入西方备战活动
    应寻求对本身独立的国际保证
    新华社31日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科31日讯：莫斯科各报刊载了苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁给丹麦首相汉森的一封信。
    布尔加宁在信中谈到了北大西洋公约组织的国家的备战措施，他说，这些战争准备并不单是对受害国家有危险，就是对参加这些准备活动的国家自己也是有同样危险的，特别是像北大西洋公约组织里面那些被当作前哨阵地和进攻基地的欧洲国家。
    布尔加宁说，北大西洋集团的领导人对丹麦的领土很感兴趣，这主要是因为这个组织的司令部把丹麦领土当作可以掌握波罗的海进出口的阵地。丹麦的格陵兰早就变成了美国的军事基地，它实际上已处于丹麦管辖之外。丹麦领土的欧洲部分布满着根据北大西洋公约组织司令部的计划建立的军用机场和海军基地。在丹麦的军事基地和军队中有美国和英国的教官。自然，在这种情况下就不能保证：北大西洋公约组织司令部一声令下，几小时之内在丹麦的军事基地上会不出现用来反对爱好和平的国家的外国武装部队。如果在丹麦实现装备有原子武器的美国特种部队驻军的计划，当然情况将更加恶化。
    布尔加宁说，丹麦让自己卷入某些国家的军事准备中，这是十分严重和不正当的冒险。要是苏联政府在反击侵略方面不采取紧急措施给侵略者和用来进攻苏联的一切根据地和基地网以毁灭性的打击，那它就没有对苏联人民负责。现代武器的摧毁力极大；对领土面积像丹麦这样的国家来说，供给外国基地，在一旦发生原子战争的时候就等于自杀。
    布尔加宁说，如果在新战争可能带来的可怕的后果面前不采取一切必要的措施去消除这种战争威胁，各国人民是不会原谅本国政府的。他希望丹麦政府能给予苏联关于欧洲集体安全问题的建议以应有的注意，并且对探求有关各方可以接受的具体途径作出贡献。在有效的欧洲集体安全体系还没有建立之前，丹麦可以寻找解决自己的安全问题的方法，比如寻求对它的独立和领土完整的国际保证。
    布尔加宁最后指出，苏联同丹麦间有着罕有的悠久而巩固的友谊传统的基础。苏联政府领导人和丹麦政府领导人去年的会见，给扩大两国人民之间的合作开辟了新的前景。但是，发展这种联系的可能性还远没有被充分利用。毫无疑问，在加强两国之间的信任和合作的情况下，可以进一步发展这种联系。
