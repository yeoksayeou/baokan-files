Huang Oudong said at the Liaoning Provincial Industrial Political Work Conference: The phenomenon of being divorced from the masses is not decreasing but increasing. They are high above and unwilling to go deep into the grassroots. Leading cadres are accustomed to this, which is very dangerous.

Shenyang, April 24th (Our Dispatch) – To correctly handle contradictions among the people, it is necessary to demand that leaders at all levels immediately eliminate bureaucracy and subjectivism, promote more democracy, listen more to the opinions of the masses, understand more about the hardships of the masses, go deep among the masses, go deep into reality, and integrate the leadership with the masses. Don't wait until things escalate to your doorstep before solving them. You should always take the initiative in everything. This is what Huang Oudong, First Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, said at the recent Industrial Political Work Conference convened by the Provincial Committee.

Huang Oudong said: In the past six months, contradictions among the people in the Liaoning area have gradually risen to a more prominent position, mainly due to errors in leadership's bureaucracy and subjectivism. We should quickly resolve the reasonable demands of the masses. If we cannot do everything, we should do our best. If we cannot do something or it is unreasonable, we should explain it clearly to the masses. For matters restricted by the regulations of higher-level leading organs, we should immediately request instructions on how to handle them. Leaders must strive to be proactive and have full trust in the people. Every leader should place himself under the supervision of the people.

Regarding how to overcome bureaucracy, Huang Oudong said: The main method is to actively improve the style of leadership and implement the mass line. The phenomenon of being divorced from the masses is not decreasing but increasing. Many leading comrades are still sitting in their offices writing notices, issuing instructions, and holding conferences. The work plans of some provincial leading organs only include arrangements for holding meetings and writing instructions, and there are no plans for investigation and research at all. What is serious is that a considerable number of leading cadres are content with this style of work. Although some units have stipulated in their systems that they should go deep into the grassroots, they are still high above. This is not the style of the proletariat, but a serious bureaucratic work style. Even mass organizations have this style. This situation is very dangerous. The reason why it is dangerous is not only because this phenomenon is very common, but also because many leading cadres are accustomed to this phenomenon, indifferent, and even numb.

Huang Oudong further analyzed the above phenomenon, saying: Some leading cadres do not understand the grassroots – that the grassroots are the foundation of all our work. There is so much rich and colorful knowledge among the masses and in practice. Some of our cadres are unwilling to go down, which only shows that they have ideologically separated themselves from the masses. They do not go deep among the masses, so they know very little and do not deeply understand the hardships of the masses. They do not care about the hardships of the masses and have reached an intolerable point. They do not care about the masses' food, clothing, housing, transportation, firewood, rice, oil, salt, work, study, emotions, and demands, as if that is "you" and not "us." For example, everyone has to eat every day, but the workers of some enterprises eat cold food every day, and the leadership is slow to solve the problem. Does this also require state investment? For example, some enterprises' workers have to queue up to defecate, and the leaders turn a blind eye to solving the problem. Is this also an insurmountable difficulty?

Speaking of correctly handling contradictions within the working class, Huang Oudong especially pointed out the importance of expanding and improving democratic life within enterprises. He said: The recent convening of worker representative conferences in several factories in Shenyang has had a very obvious effect: the production enthusiasm of the workers has been greatly improved, the sense of responsibility of the workers as masters has been greatly enhanced, the internal unity of the working class has been significantly strengthened, and the relationship between the leadership and the masses has become closer. This has improved the leadership, improved the work, and promoted the further development of the increase production and practice economy movement. This is a method of relying on the masses wholeheartedly, and it is also an effective form of expanding democracy, supervising leadership, and trusting all employees to participate in enterprise management.

The industrial political work conference lasted for seven days. More than 300 people attended the meeting, including secretaries of municipal, prefectural, and county party committees, ministers of industry, secretaries of party committees of factories and mines, and responsible comrades of mass organizations.

    必须清除官僚主义习气
    黄欧东在辽宁省工业政治工作会议上说：目前脱离群众的现象不是减少而是增加，他们高高在上不愿深入下层，领导干部对此习以为常，这是很危险的。
    本报沈阳24日电　要正确处理人民内部的矛盾，必须要求各级领导立即消除官僚主义和主观主义，多发扬些民主，多听些群众的意见，多了解群众的疾苦，深入群众，深入实际，使领导和群众打成一片；不要等到事情闹到门前才去解决，应该处处采取主动，事事采取主动。这是中共辽宁省委第一书记黄欧东在最近省委召开的工业政治工作会议上说的。
    黄欧东说：近半年来辽宁地区人民内部的矛盾逐渐上升到比较显著的地位，这主要是由于领导上的官僚主义和主观主义的错误。我们对于群众的合理的要求，应该迅速解决。不能全部办到的，应该尽力而为，办不到和不合理的，要向群众解释清楚；凡属涉及上级领导机关规定所限制的事情，应该即时请示处理办法。领导者必须力求主动，对人民群众要有充分的信任。每个领导者都应该把自己放在人民群众的监督之下。
    关于如何克服官僚主义的问题，黄欧东说：主要的办法是积极改进领导作风，贯彻群众路线。目前脱离群众的现象不是减少而是增加了。很多领导同志仍然坐在办公室里写通知、发指示、召开大会。有些省的领导机关的工作计划，只有开会议和写指示的部署，而根本没有调查研究的计划。严重的是，相当一部分领导干部安于这种作风，有的单位虽然从制度上规定了要深入下层，结果还是高高在上。这不是无产阶级的作风，而是严重的官僚主义习气，甚至连群众团体也有这种作风。这种情况是很危险的。其所以危险，不仅在于这现象十分普遍，而且在于不少领导干部对于这种现象习以为常，无动于衷，甚至到了麻痹的程度。
    黄欧东对上述现象进一步作了分析，他说：有些领导干部不懂下面——基层是我们一切工作的基础。在群众之中，实际之中，有着多么丰富多采的知识。我们有些干部不愿意下去，只说明他们在思想上已经脱离了群众，他们不深入群众，对群众的疾苦就知道的很少，体会的不深。他们不关心群众的疾苦，已经达到不可容忍的地步。他们对群众的衣食住行、柴米油盐、工作和学习、情绪和要求，根本不加过问，好像那是“你们”，不是“我们”。例如吃饭问题，人人要吃，天天要吃，可是有些企业的工人天天吃冷饭，领导上迟迟不予解决，这难道也须要国家投资吗？比如拉屎问题，有些企业的工人拉屎都得排队，领导者睁着眼睛不去解决，这难道也是不可克服的困难吗？
    说到正确处理工人阶级内部矛盾的问题，黄欧东特别指出扩大与健全企业内部民主生活的重要性。他说：沈阳几个工厂最近时期召开了职工代表大会，效果非常明显：工人的生产积极性大大提高，工人的主人翁的责任感大大增强，工人阶级的内部团结显著加强，领导与群众的关系也更加密切了；因而改进了领导，改进了工作，促进了增产节约运动的进一步开展；这是全心全意依靠群众的办法，也是扩大民主、监督领导和信任全体职工参加企业管理的有效形式。
    这次工业政治工作会议一共开了七天。出席会议的有各市、地、县委书记、工业部长和厂矿的党委书记、群众团体负责同志等三百多人。
