Building the Country Through Thrift and Hard Work
By our correspondent Chen Jun

Editor's Note: In recent years, our country's industrial construction has achieved tremendous successes. However, we cannot be satisfied with the achievements we have already made. Therefore, looking back at the road we have traveled and thinking about what we should do in the future will be of great benefit. This article raises issues in many areas such as planning, design, industrial layout, and urban construction based on the current situation of several cities. These problems are mainly due to our lack of construction experience. In the past, spending more money due to a lack of understanding was unavoidable. As long as we are good at summarizing the lessons learned from spending this money and continue to work hard to learn, we will be able to learn to spend less money and get more done in future construction endeavors, using limited funds to build more industries and earnestly implement the policy of building the country through thrift and hard work.

Anyone who wants to see the scale and speed of industrial construction in our country during the First Five-Year Plan period will be deeply impressed by taking a trip to the Northwest. In the spring of 1955, I visited Xi'an, Lanzhou, and Yumen. Recently, I revisited these cities and also went to Chengdu in Sichuan. What I saw and heard was all a scene of prosperity. Xi'an has transformed from a city with a weak industrial base into an industrial and cultural center with a population of one million. The urban area of Xi'an has expanded to 5.4 times its size in 1949. More than 20 large factories are distributed in the eastern, northern, and western suburbs, facing each other from afar. The "Textile City" that has emerged on the bank of the Chan River, with just the three cotton textile factories that have already been put into production and one that is being tested, has 230,000 spindles and more than 7,000 looms. The total industrial output value of the city has increased by 76.8 times compared to seven years ago. The southern suburbs are the cultural district, where more than ten universities are concentrated. The scale of the schools is very large. The urban area of Lanzhou has expanded to 60 kilometers from east to west. The industrial zones of Xigu and Qilihe, planned and built two years ago, already have high-rise buildings in clusters. The population here increased by nearly 220,000 people in just the past year (from February 1956 to March of this year). Two years ago, traveling from Lanzhou to the Hexi Corridor mainly relied on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Highway, which ran across the Gobi Desert. I remember at that time, transporting crude oil from Yumen eastward was an extremely difficult task. Oil trucks were running back and forth day and night, in an endless stream. When a convoy of cars drove by, the dust raised blocked out the sky, and it was impossible to see people on the opposite side. Road maintenance workers repaired this oil transportation road, which was bumpy and uneven from being crushed, in the wind and sand all year round. At that time, one of the biggest tasks of the Yumen Mining Bureau was to carry out a "sprinkling oil to suppress dust" project from west to east, rebuilding hundreds of kilometers of asphalt road from Yumen to Zhangye, preparing to connect to the Lanzhou-Xinjiang road being built from east to west. Who would have thought that the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway would be built so quickly that the railway had already reached the doorstep before the "sprinkling oil to suppress dust" project was fully launched. Now, the Yumen to Wuwei section of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Road has become quiet, and you can no longer see oil trucks broken down, overturned, or struggling in the muddy road surface on the long journey in the Gobi Desert. Along the way, the Yongdeng Cement Plant is about to be completed, the Shandan Coal Mine has started construction, and several other cities have been selected as new industrial zones.

The progress of industrial construction is exciting. However, the rapid and vigorous development of industrial construction has brought a series of problems. Various kinds of "shortages" can be seen and heard everywhere: shortage of funds, shortage of building materials, shortage of supplies, shortage of buses, shortage of movie and theater tickets, shortage of parks, shortage of bathhouses and barber shops... Are these shortages due to our industrial construction being too fast and vigorous? Let us explore this from some common situations existing in several cities.

          Speaking of the Land of Women
When you visit the "Textile City" in Xi'an, the leaders of the factories will tell you a new problem they have encountered: female workers cannot find marriage partners. It turns out that this "Textile City" concentrates the city's newly built textile and dyeing factories. The Northwest Third, Fourth, and Fifth Cotton Textile Factories alone have more than 8,000 female workers, most of whom are young.

It makes sense to choose this textile area, consisting of six or seven similar factories, as an industrial zone from the perspective of proximity to power sources and ease of management. However, it is twenty to thirty miles away from the city center and far from other factory areas. Naturally, the "Textile City" has become an isolated "Land of Women," and it is inconvenient to travel to and from the city center and other factories, which has caused unexpected troubles for the factory leaders and most of the unmarried female workers.

Like the "Textile City," being far away from the city center but having to rely on the city center in many aspects increases many difficulties in urban construction. The vast majority of newly built factories in Xi'an are scattered in the four suburbs. The formation of this layout is due to the fact that the principle of compact development was not considered when selecting factory sites, nor was the method of establishing workers' towns simply followed for layout. After the factory sites were determined, the urban planning department, due to the existence of big-city thinking, did not proceed from reality and planned according to the long-term vision of urban development, but insisted on linking the various scattered industrial areas together to form a complete city. However, the factories and other buildings envisioned in the long-term plan cannot all be carried out at the same time in the near future. As a result, the current situation is that the various factories are scattered within a range of twenty to thirty miles around the city, with some in the east, some in the west, and unable to form a unified whole. And these factories blooming everywhere must rely on newly opened roads, sewers, power lines, etc. to connect them to the city center. Often, for one factory, dozens of miles of roads must be built for exclusive use. After the roads are built, no one except the factory's employees walks on some of them. In the past few years, Xi'an has invested nearly 48 million yuan in public utilities, newly opened more than 170 kilometers of roads, laid more than 70 kilometers of drainage pipes, and more than 130 kilometers of water distribution pipes. How much material and labor is needed! However, even so, many construction units are still complaining that there are no roads to travel on or that the road surfaces are not good. The entire cultural district in the southern suburbs, with an area of 20 square kilometers, has only 6 kilometers of drainage pipes. As a result, although the universities here have flush toilets, they cannot be used because there are no pipes to discharge feces and sewage. And the newly built urban areas are each in one direction, neither taking advantage of the conditions in the city center nor being able to build a complete set of shops, cinemas, and theaters at the same time as the factories. In this way, if the workers want to buy things, get haircuts, take baths, or see plays, they all have to flock to the city on holidays, so buses cannot meet the demand, stores are overcrowded, and movie and theater tickets are even harder to buy.

The situation in Lanzhou is, in some respects, more difficult than in Xi'an. The urban area is as long as 60 kilometers, and the investment required to install the entire water supply and drainage system is estimated to be around 200 million yuan.

There is a factory in Sichuan that is built alone 10 kilometers away from the city. Twenty-two units such as banks, post offices, bookstores, sewing shops, restaurants, food service industries, barber shops, and bathhouses have set up branches in the factory area. The houses of these units are mostly built with factory investment, which increases non-productive expenses. The service personnel of these institutions number 577 (excluding indirect service personnel), plus the factory's own service personnel, there are a total of 908 people, accounting for 26% of the total number of factory employees.

Therefore, how to determine the industrial layout, so as not to make the city expand and disperse excessively, so that the newly built factory area can fully rely on the original city, save investment in public utilities, and facilitate the masses, is still a question worth studying.

            Water Flows Upward
Newly built and expanded cities must have a plan. However, any plan should take into account the principles of economy and thrift, the original foundation of the city, and the convenience of the masses.

A new urban area in Xi'an expanding to the southeast needs to build a flood discharge project. This project has already started. If you visit the construction site, you will see that the flood discharge project here is not being constructed according to the terrain conditions and the natural flow of floods to save state investment as much as possible, but in order to maintain the symmetry and straightness of the road system and the formation of green spaces on the planning map, regardless of the terrain, a large amount of earthwork is excavated to force the water from low places to high places.

The Xi'an Municipal Bureau of Culture proposed to build a theater in Hansenzhai, where workers' dormitories are relatively concentrated. There is plenty of open space here, but because the city planning map does not provide for a theater to be built here, although this place is now vacant, it cannot be built here. Therefore, this theater was designated to be built in Changle District, several miles away from Hansenzhai. This theater was built, costing 370,000 yuan. However, there is only a Power Institute nearby, and no other residents, so tickets cannot be sold; and the workers living in Hansenzhai still cannot see plays.

What has added to the difficulties of urban construction are the unreasonable current standards and quotas for urban areas and factory buildings, and the disconnection of planning and design ideas from reality. Due to the high standards for civil air defense and hygiene, the distance between factories is generally 600 meters, and the hygienic protection distance between factories and residential areas ranges from several hundred meters to one kilometer. The quotas used in Xi'an's urban planning are a residential area of 9 square meters per person on average, a land use area of 76 square meters per person, of which green space is 15 square meters. This is a standard that is difficult to achieve within this century. The design of the factory, the building coefficient in the factory area is too low, the building land accounts for only about 20% of the total factory area, some are even as low as 4.6%; the green area in the factory area is too large, generally about 20%, and some are as high as 50%; and a large part is reserved for the second phase and even the "third" phase of development, so that a factory occupies hundreds or even thousands of acres. Some factories also enclose a so-called "alert zone" of 50 meters and a "protection zone" of 150 meters around the factory area. According to the statistics of six factories belonging to a central ministry in Taiyuan and Xi'an, about 1,430 mu of land is used more than necessary. Calculated at 600 jin per mu per year, the annual reduction in grain production is as high as 850,000 jin; these six factories also have separate administrative regions, which occupy another 800 mu of land, resulting in another 480,000 jin less grain produced each year. Due to the above reasons, a large amount of unused land is left inside the factory area and inside the residential area, between factories and between factories and residential areas, resulting in significant waste in pipeline and road investment. Needless to say, this approach has also caused many inconveniences to the lives of residents. According to preliminary estimates, if the distance between factories can be reduced, about 20% of the investment in off-site projects can be saved, accounting for 1% to 1.5% of the total factory investment, and an industrial area can save tens of millions of yuan. If the building coefficient in the factory area is increased and less land is reserved for development, even more investment can be saved. It can be seen that the requirements in all aspects of greening, civil air defense, and hygiene are issues that should be considered in a century-long plan, but once these requirements are divorced from reality, they will bring many troubles and waste to construction.

        "Illegal" Buildings
In urban construction, there is a commonly used term—"illegal" buildings. This refers to all buildings that do not meet the requirements of urban construction and are carried out. On this issue, in order to ensure that urban construction is reasonable, there needs to be a certain authority, certain laws and regulations to review the construction plans proposed by various departments. In recent years, some units in various cities have indeed disregarded the overall interests and built indiscriminately for their own convenience, causing a lot of waste. According to the inspection in Sichuan Province, 14 construction units have arbitrarily occupied more than 1,539 mu of land. However, at the same time, some of the existing rules and regulations are indeed worth reconsidering. For example, if the number of floors of a building is not enough, construction is not allowed. For example, the construction of simple theaters or residences is not allowed because it does not meet fire protection requirements. An agency with only 50 or 60 staff members is preparing to build an office building, but that location will be a high-rise building area in the future, so a building of more than five floors must be built now. However, how can a small agency with 50 or 60 people afford to build such a large building? Two newly built schools, after completion, did not have enough school buildings, so they added some bungalows on the open space within the school grounds. This matter was discovered by the Urban Planning and Construction Affairs Administration, which criticized the two schools, saying that this practice was wrong, violated the government's construction management laws, and caused great losses to the country. By the end of 1956, according to the materials of the Shaanxi Provincial Urban Construction Bureau, there were 260,000 square meters of "illegal" buildings in Xi'an. According to the person in charge of the Urban Construction Bureau: "Because the welfare of employees was emphasized in 1956, many units wanted to build bungalows because they did not have building materials. Because they did not meet the requirements of urban planning, these units built them secretly. As a result, the houses illegally built by some units occupied the location of permanent buildings in the plan, destroying the rational layout of the city." Of course, it is wrong for some units to "secretly" build houses, but on the other hand, the problem is also worth studying. That is, when the shortage of employee dormitories is very serious and the state's funds are tight, is it better to let employees sleep on the streets than to allow "illegal" construction of low-rise buildings? Is it better to make the land wait for decades for greening than to allow the construction of simply built dormitories or entertainment venues on the open space near the factory? Therefore, the current building regulations and laws may have situations that do not conform to reality. If they can be researched and modified based on the principles of building the country through diligence and thrift and the needs of the masses, it would be beneficial.

    Adding Flowers to Embroidery or Providing Charcoal in the Snow
The demands of many cities' employees for cultural life are urgent. Is there no way to solve this problem appropriately? Can we spend less money and do more things?

There are currently 32 cinemas and theaters in Xi'an. Due to historical reasons, except for one newly built cinema in the eastern suburbs, all others are in the city center, of which 17 are concentrated near the Bell Tower. In this way, on ordinary days, these cinemas and theaters do not have that many audiences, but on holidays, they cannot accommodate so many audiences from the four suburbs. There is no way to talk about the unreasonable phenomenon left over from the old society. Looking back now, if the four theaters of People's, Democracy, Small Theater, and Chun Guang, which were built near the Bell Tower after 1954, were scattered to places farther from the Bell Tower and to the new urban areas, it would be possible to appropriately reduce the congestion in the city center and reduce the burden on buses. And according to the original plans for 1958 and 1959, two of the four cinemas and theaters that Xi'an plans to build are still to be built in the city center, one is a children's cinema with a planned investment of 680,000 yuan, and the other is a wide-screen cinema with a planned investment of 1.05 million yuan. This is worth studying.

As for the cost of newly built theaters and cinemas, it is generally relatively high. For example, the construction cost of the Democracy Theater is 230,000 yuan, the May Fourth Theater is 240,000 yuan, the Chang'an Theater is 330,000 yuan, and the People's Theater is more than 1 million yuan. These four theaters cost nearly 2 million yuan. If the construction cost standards of the theaters are lowered and simply built buildings costing tens of thousands of yuan are built, the same amount of money can be used to build more than 20 of them. With a rational distribution, the cultural and entertainment needs of employees in the newly built areas can be basically met. What kind of thinking is hindering the development of simply built theaters? According to a comrade from the Municipal Bureau of Culture: "To build a theater, at least 600,000 to 700,000 yuan should be invested to meet a minimum standard." This kind of thinking can also be seen from the fact that the investment amount for each of the nine cinemas and theaters that Xi'an originally planned to build during the Second Five-Year Plan period ranged from 680,000 yuan to 1.9 million yuan.

There are similar situations in commercial and other service industries. Taking Xi'an as an example, at present, most of these industries are concentrated in the city center. Now there are 450,000 people in the various newly built urban areas of Xi'an, accounting for 43% of the total urban population, but there are only 1,691 people engaged in commercial and service industries, accounting for only 3.7% of the total number of employees in commercial and service industries in the city. It is no wonder that there are very few commercial supply points in the new urban areas.

The high standards for office buildings and welfare facilities and the idea that "factory modernization should be matched by welfare facilities" can also be found in every newly built city. This idea, however, hinders solving problems for the masses. Many new factories are designed like a garden, and there are also beautiful office buildings. Many factory dormitories are equipped with water (tap water), heating (gas), electricity (lights), and toilets (sanitary equipment). The cost per square meter of employee dormitories at the Northwest State-owned Fourth Cotton Textile Factory is 99.1 yuan. The cost per square meter of the workers' village at the Sichuan Cement Plant is an average of 60 yuan, which is relatively low, but this workers' village includes the cost of building dormitories, clubs, canteens, cooperatives, barber shops, primary schools, hospitals, nurseries, tap water, electricity, telephones, and green spaces, totaling more than 2.17 million yuan. It is estimated that this village can accommodate 3,000 employees, with an average investment of more than 700 yuan per person. If you compare it with similar buildings in the local area: the cost per square meter of local earth-walled, tile-roofed bungalows is only 15 yuan; the cost per square meter of a small primary school of 320 square meters is only 12 yuan, while the cost per square meter of this factory's primary school is 53 yuan.

Don't these situations again illustrate that in today's situation where state investment is limited, especially when it is necessary to concentrate the state's financial and material resources on the most urgently needed development of industrial production, if living welfare facilities strive to be simple and unadorned, meet the needs of the broad masses, and provide charcoal in the snow rather than adding flowers to embroidery for a few, then the same amount of money can be used to do more things for the masses.

          What the Great Migration Brings
The increase in urban population is very rapid. Taiyuan, Xi'an, Lanzhou, and Chengdu have all felt the difficulties caused by the population increase. Can this situation be appropriately controlled?

According to the statistics of Chengdu, the urban population in 1956 increased by more than 132,500 people compared with 1955. In addition to the natural increase of more than 20,000 people, those who moved in from other places accounted for more than 112,000 people. Most of them are employees and their families. According to the investigation of two factories, one factory has 1,506 employees, of which 808 were transferred from other provinces. Only 32 of the technicians had to be transferred from the old factory. The other 776 were ordinary workers and apprentices, who could be recruited locally. Another factory has 1,409 employees. Apart from the 52 who were recruited in the city and 249 technicians who were transferred from other places, the remaining 1,108 could also be hired locally. As for the batch of workers being transferred in and out of the basic construction units, this is even more common. The construction company responsible for building the Sichuan Cement Plant transferred more than 1,100 workers from the Northeast and Hebei, and the number of family members who moved with them reached 5,000. The state spends an average of 1,000 yuan for the transfer of each employee.

Another population that has increased more is the teachers, students, and staff of universities and secondary technical schools. Chengdu increased by 23,000 people in one year. Xi'an originally planned to have only five universities with more than 14,000 students by 1959, but now there are 16 universities, and the number of students in universities and secondary technical schools has reached more than 50,000. I attended a symposium for students at the Power Institute. The 14 students present came from nine provinces and one city. The north-south movement of students across the country not only increases the burden on newly built cities, but also causes many avoidable troubles and problems due to the different living habits of the students, which increases the difficulties in work.

The last item of population increase is the peasants who "blindly" entered the city. Among them, a significant proportion is brought in by employees. Why are there so many "blind" people? It turns out that there are many systems that encourage farmers to enter the city. Taking the companies belonging to the two construction units of the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering in Lanzhou and Xi'an as examples, last year, in accordance with the notice of the relevant departments of the Central Government, all employees whose family members moved in were given travel expenses and settlement allowances. The settlement allowance alone was issued at a standard of 60% of the employee's salary (reaching 100% in Lanzhou), and 25% of the employee's salary for each family member. In addition, there are various kinds of subsidies and electricity and water subsidies. If the rent for private houses exceeds a certain amount, all of it is subsidized by the public. Employees who do not bring family members cannot naturally enjoy these subsidies. In this way, why wouldn't employees be happy to move their family members into the city! According to an investigation by a work section of the Northwest Second Engineering Company, among the families of 84 employees, there were 39 who could completely not have moved in. Among the family members who moved in, there were not only the direct relatives of the employees, but also many people brought in uncles, aunts, cousins, and younger sisters-in-law. This situation has resulted in employees' families having large populations, living in difficulties, increasing the tension in urban housing, and also making many producers in rural areas unable to find work after entering the city, but instead becoming idlers. At present, all units belonging to the Central Ministry of Construction Engineering have cancelled this unreasonable system of settlement allowances and are preparing to adopt a system of regular vacations every year, giving employees whose families are in rural areas a vacation of half a month to a month. However, systems like this that encourage farmers to enter the city are not uncommon in other regions and factories and mines.

          What is the Key to the Problem?
From the above situation, it is not difficult for readers to see that due to our insufficient understanding of the significance of building the country through diligence and thrift and our lack of construction experience, we have spent a lot of money that could have been saved in the past few years, and because of spending more money, we have increased many difficulties that could have been avoided. If we can learn from this experience, we will definitely be able to further implement the policy of building the country through diligence and thrift, use every yuan of state funds more appropriately, and use the same amount of money to build more and better industries.

    勤俭建国
    本报记者　陈浚
    编者按　几年来，我国的工业建设获得了巨大的成就，但是，我们不能满足于已得的成就。因之，回头看看走过的道路，想想今后该怎么办，是会有很大益处的。这篇通讯，从几个城市发展的现状中，提出了规划、设计、工业布局、城市建设等多方面的问题。这些问题，主要是由于我们缺乏建设的经验而来的。过去由于不懂，多花了钱，是难免的。只要我们善于总结这些花了大钱所得来的经验教训，继续努力学习，那么，就会使我们在今后的建设事业中，学会少花钱，多办事，用有限的资金，办更多的工业，认真贯彻执行勤俭建国方针。
    谁要想看到我国第一个五年计划期间工业建设的规模和速度，到西北走一趟，就会得到极其深刻的印象。1955年春，记者曾访问过西安、兰州、玉门，最近，重访了这些城市，并到了四川的成都。所见所闻，都是一片兴旺气象。西安从原来是一个工业基础薄弱的城市，一跃而成为拥有百万人口的工业和文化中心。西安市区的面积，发展到1949年的五点四倍。东郊、北郊和西郊，分布着的二十多座大工厂，遥遥相望。滻河畔出现的“纺织城”，只是两个已经投入生产和一座正在试车的纺织厂，就有二十三万纱锭和七千多台织布机。全市工业的总产值，已比七年以前提高了七十六点八倍。南郊是文化区，集中着十多所高等学校。学校的规模都很大。兰州市区，东西已扩展到六十公里，两年以前规划建设的工业区，西固和七里河，已经有了成片的高层建筑。这里的人口，只在过去一年里（1956年2月到今年3月），就增加了近二十二万人。两年以前，从兰州到河西走廊，主要只能依靠横贯戈壁滩的兰新公路。记得当时玉门的原油东运，是一件异常艰巨的工作。运油的汽车，整天整夜来回奔驶，川流不息。一队汽车迎面驶过，扬起的尘土，遮天蔽日，对面不能见人。护路工人，长年累月在风沙里修补这条被压得坎坷不平的运油道路。当时，玉门矿务局最大的任务之一，是要由西向东进行“洒油灭尘”的工程，从玉门到张掖改建几百公里的柏油路面，准备接上从东向西修建的兰新路。那里会想到，兰新铁路修得这么快，没有等到“洒油灭尘”工程全面展开，铁路已经修到了门口。现在，兰新路玉门到武威一段，已经变得宁静了，再也看不到戈壁滩上，在漫漫的长途中，抛了锚的，翻了的，或者陷在泛浆路面挣扎的油车。一路上，永登的水泥厂行将完工，山丹煤矿已开工兴建，又有几座城市被选定为新的工业区。
    工业建设进展的情景，是令人兴奋的。但是，工业建设发展得又多、又快、又猛，带来了一连串的问题，到处可以看到和听到各种各样的“紧张”：资金紧张，建筑材料紧张，物资供应紧张，公共汽车紧张，看电影看戏紧张，公园紧张，洗澡理发紧张……。这些紧张，是不是由于我们工业建设得太快太猛而来的呢？让我们从几个城市里所存在的一些共同的情况来探讨一下。
          从女儿国说起
    当你访问西安“纺织城”的时候，厂里的领导同志都会告诉你一个他们碰到的新问题：女工找不到结婚的对象。原来，这个“纺织城”，集中了全市新建的纺织和印染厂，只是西北第三、第四、第五等三个棉纺织厂，就有女工八千多人，其中大部分是青年。
    这个纺织区选在这里，由六、七个同类工厂组成一个工业区，从靠近电源、便于管理来看，是有道理的。可是，这里距离市中心区有二、三十里，距离别的工厂区也很远，自然而然，使“纺织城”成为一个孤立的“女儿国”，同市区，同别的工厂，来往不便，为工厂的领导人和大部没有结婚的女工们，招来了意外的烦恼。
    像“纺织城”这样，远离市区，而在许多方面又必须依靠市区，就增加了城市建设中的许多困难。西安市新建的工厂，绝大多数都是分散在四郊的。这个布局的形成，是由于在工业选厂的时候，没有注意紧凑发展的原则，也没有干脆按照建立工人镇的办法进行布置；在厂址确定之后，城市规划部门又由于存在着大城市思想，不从实际出发，按照城市的发展远景进行规划，硬要把各个分散的工业区联在一起，组成完整的城市。可是远景规划上所设想的工厂和其他建筑，并不是近期所都能同时进行的。因之，出现了目前各个工厂，散在市区周围二、三十里的范围之内，东也有，西也有，不能联成一气。而这些遍地开花的工厂区都要依靠新开辟的道路、上下水道、电线等等，把它们同市中心区联结起来。往往为了一个工厂，要修建独家使用的几十里长的道路。修好了，有的道路，除了一个工厂的职工以外，就再也没有人走了。几年来，西安市投入公用事业的资金近四千八百万元，新辟道路一百七十多公里，敷设排水管道七十多公里，自来水配水管一百三十多公里；需要多少材料和人工啊！但是，即使如此，还有不少建设单位喊没有路走，路面不好。整个南郊的文化区，有二十平方公里，只有六公里的排水管道。以致这里的高等学校，虽有抽水马桶，苦于无管道排出粪便污水，不能利用。而新建市区，各在一方，既利用不上市中心区的条件，又不可能在建厂的同时搞起全套的商店、电影院、剧院。这样，职工们要买东西，要理发、洗澡，要看戏，一到假日，都得往城里涌，于是，公共汽车供不应求，商店挤得水泄不通，电影票戏票更难买上。
    兰州的情况，在某些方面，比西安还要困难。市区狭长达六十公里，单是供水排水系统，等到全部安设好，预计需要投资两亿元左右。
    四川有一个工厂，孤单单地建在离城十公里处。银行、邮局、书店、缝纫店、餐厅、饮食业、理发馆、洗澡堂等二十二个单位在厂区设了分支机构。这些单位的房屋绝大部分由工厂投资兴建，增加了非生产性的开支。这些机构的服务人员达到五百七十七人（间接服务的人员还不在内），加上工厂本身服务性的人员，共有九百零八人，为全厂职工总数的26％。
    因之，怎样确定工业布局，不致使城市过分扩大和分散，使新建工厂区能够充分依靠原有城市，节省公用事业的投资，便利群众，还是一个值得研究的问题。
            水向高处流
    新建和扩建的城市，必须要有个规划。但是，任何规划，都应当考虑到经济和节约的原则，考虑到城市原有的基础，考虑到对群众的方便。
    西安市向东南扩展的一片新市区，需要修筑排洪工程。这个工程已经开始动工了。如果你到工地去参观，就会看到这里的排洪工程，不是根据地形条件和洪水的自然流向，进行建设，以尽可能地节省国家投资，而是为了保持规划图上道路系统的对称、平直，绿化地带的形成，不顾地形，大量挖掘土方，硬要把低处的水排向高处。
    西安市文化局提出要在一个职工宿舍比较集中的韩森寨，修建一座剧院。这里有的是空地，可是由于城市规划图上没有在这里设置剧院，此地现在虽然空着，也不能在此修建。于是，这座剧院被指定修建在离韩森寨几里远的长乐区。这座剧院盖好了，花了三十七万元。可是附近只有一个动力学院，别无居民，卖不了票；而住在韩森寨的职工还是看不到戏。
    给城市建设增加了困难的，还有城市市区和工厂建筑现行的某些标准定额不合理，规划和设计的思想脱离实际。由于人民防空、卫生标准太高，厂与厂之间的距离一般是六百公尺，工厂和住宅区之间的卫生防护距离，由数百公尺到一公里不等。西安城市规划采用的定额，居住面积每人平均九平方公尺，用地面积每人七十六平方公尺，其中绿化用地为十五平方公尺，这是在这个世纪之内都难以达到的标准。工厂的设计，厂区内的建筑系数太低，建筑物用地占全厂区用地面积一般只在20％左右，个别的甚至有低到4.6％的；厂区内的绿化面积太大，一般为20％左右，个别有高达50％以上的；而且还保留了很大一部分供第二期以至“第三”期发展的用地，以致一个工厂占地动辄数百亩甚至数千亩。有的工厂，还在厂区周围圈出五十公尺的所谓“警戒地带”，一百五十公尺的“防护地带”。据太原、西安中央一个部所属六个工厂的统计，多用土地约一千四百三十亩，按每亩年产量六百斤计算，每年少生产的粮食就达八十五万斤之多；这六个工厂还都有单独的行政区，又多占用土地约八百亩，每年又少产粮食四十八万斤。由于上述各项原因，就使得工厂厂区内部和住宅区的内部、工厂和工厂之间以及工厂和住宅区之间，留下了大量不好利用的空地，在管道和道路的投资上，造成了重大的浪费。这种作法，对居民的生活，不用说也造成了很多不方便。据初步估算，如果工厂和工厂之间的距离能够紧缩一些，大约可以节约厂外工程投资的20％左右，占全部工厂投资的1％到1.5％，一个工业区就可能节约数千万元，厂区内的建筑系数提高一些，发展用地少留一些，还可以节约更多的投资。可见，绿化、防空、卫生等各方面的要求，虽是百年大计所应当考虑的问题，但是，这些要求一旦脱离了实际，就会给建设带来很多的麻烦和浪费。
        “违章”建筑
    在城市建筑里，有一个常用的名词——“违章”建筑。这是指的一切不合乎城市建设要求，而进行的建筑。在这一个问题上，为了保证城市建设得合理，需要有一定的机关，一定的法令和规章，来审核各个部门提出的建筑计划。这些年来，各个城市，确实也曾经发生过有些单位，不顾整体利益，只图自己方便，胡乱修建，造成不少浪费的现象。据四川省的检查，十四个建筑单位擅自占用的土地就达到一千五百三十九亩以上。但是，同时，在现有的规章法令之中，确也有一部分值得重新考虑的。比如建筑物的层数不够，不准施工。比如修建简易建筑的剧院或住宅，以不合防火要求，也不得施工。有一个机关，只有五、六十个工作人员，准备修建一幢办公室，但是那个地段，将来是高层建筑区，所以现在必须修建五层以上的楼房。可是，五、六十个人的小机关，怎么修得起这样的大楼呢？有两个新建的学校，建成以后，校舍不够用，就在学校范围里的空地上，加盖了一部分平房。这件事被城市规划与建筑事务管理局发觉了，就批评这两个学校说，这种作法是错误的，是违反政府建筑管理法令的，给国家造成了很大损失。到1956年底，陕西省城市建设局的材料，西安全市有二十六万平方公尺的“违章”建筑。据城市建设局负责人说：“由于1956年强调了职工福利事业，许多单位由于没有建筑材料，要修建平房，因为不符城市规划的要求，这些单位竟偷着盖了。结果，有些单位违章建筑的房子，占了规划上永久性建筑的位置，破坏了城市的合理布局。”当然，有些单位“偷着”盖房子是不对的，可是，另一方面的问题，也是有研究的余地的。就是当着职工宿舍不够的情况十分严重、国家资金困难的时候，难道宁可让职工露宿街头，而不许“违章”修建低层建筑吗？难道宁使地皮等待几十年以后的绿化，而不许在那个靠近工厂的空地上，修建简易建筑的宿舍或者娱乐场所吗？因之，现行的建筑的规章和法令，可能有不合实际的情况，如果能够根据勤俭建国和群众需要的原则，加以研究和修改，是会有好处的。
    锦上添花还是雪里送炭
    许多城市的职工对于文化生活的要求是迫切的。这个问题是不是没有办法加以适当解决呢？是不是能少花些钱，更多办一些事呢？
    西安全市现有影剧院三十二座。由于历史的原因，除了在东郊新建的一个影剧院以外，其他全部在市中心区，其中又有十七个集中在钟楼附近。这样，在平常的日子里，这些影院剧院并没有那么多的观众，可是到了假日，又容纳不了那么多来自四郊的观众。旧社会遗留下来不合理的现象，就无法去说它了。现在回过头来看看，如果把1954年以后，在钟楼附近修建的人民、民主、小剧场和春光四座剧场，分散到离钟楼较远和新市区去，就可能适当减少市中心区的拥挤现象，减轻公共汽车的负担。而根据1958、1959两年的原来计划，西安准备修建的四个电影院和剧院来看，也还有两个是要修建在市中心区的，一个是计划投资六十八万元的儿童电影院，一个是计划投资一百零五万元的宽银幕电影院。这就值得研究了。
    至于新建的剧院和影院的造价，一般也是比较高的。比如民主剧院的建筑费是二十三万元，五四剧院二十四万元，长安剧院三十三万元，人民剧院一百多万元。这四座剧院就用了近二百万元。如果降低剧院的造价标准，修建几万元一座的简易建筑，就能够用同样的钱，建筑二十多座，再加以合理分布，就可能基本上满足新建区职工文化娱乐的需要。什么思想妨碍着简易建筑的剧院的发展呢？据市文化局的一位同志说：“修建一座剧院，至少应该投资六十到七十万元，才够个起码的标准。”这种思想，从西安市原来在第二个五年计划期间，准备新建的九个电影院和剧院每座的投资额，少的是六十八万元，多的到一百九十万元，也可以看出。
    在商业和别的服务性行业中，也有类似情况。以西安为例，目前这些行业，绝大部分集中在市中心区。现在西安各个新建市区已有四十五万人，占全部城市人口的43％，可是从事商业和服务性行业的人员只有一千六百九十一人，只占全市商业和服务性行业工作人员总数的3.7％。这就难怪在新市区里，很少商业供应点了。
    对于办公楼、福利设施的标准高，“工厂现代化，福利设施也要相称”的思想，也同样在各个新建城市可以找到。而这种思想，却妨碍了面向群众解决问题。有许多新厂设计得像一座花园，还有漂亮的办公大楼。许多工厂的宿舍，是水（自来水）暖（气）电（灯）卫（卫生设备）俱全。西北国营第四棉纺织厂职工宿舍每平方公尺造价九十九元一角。四川水泥厂工人村的造价每平方公尺平均六十元，虽是比较低了，可是这个工人村包括修建宿舍、俱乐部、食堂、合作社、理发室、小学、医院、托儿所、自来水、电灯、电话、绿化地带的用费，共计二百一十七万多元。预计这个村里可容职工三千人，平均为每人投资七百多元。如果同当地类似的建筑比较一下：当地土墙、瓦顶的平房，每平方公尺造价只需十五元；一所三百二十平方公尺的小学，每平方公尺造价只十二元，而这个工厂的小学，每平方公尺造价却要五十三元。
    上面这些情况，不又是说明了在国家投资有限的今天，尤其是需要把国家的财力和物力集中到最急需的发展工业生产中去的时候，生活福利设施如果能力求简单朴素，面向广大群众的需要，雪里送炭，而不是为少数人锦上添花，那么，就是用同样多的钱，也是能够为群众办更多的事情的。
          大搬家所带来的
    城市人口的增加，十分迅速。太原、西安、兰州、成都，都同样感到了人口增加所发生的困难。这种情况能不能适当加以控制呢？
    据成都市的统计，城市人口的1956年比1955年增加了十三万二千五百多人，除了自然增加的两万多人以外，从外地迁来的占十一万二千多人。其中大部分是职工和他们的家属。据两个工厂的调查，一个工厂现有职工一千五百零六人，其中由外省调来的有八百零八人中，只有三十二个技术工人是必须从老厂调的，其他七百七十六人都是普通工和学徒，完全可以在本地招收。另一个工厂，现有职工一千四百零九人，除了在本市招的五十二人、外地调入的技工二百四十九人以外，其余一千一百零八人，也是可以从本地招雇的。至于在基本建设单位中，成批工人的调进调出，更是普遍的现象。负责修建四川水泥厂的建筑公司，从东北和河北调来工人一千一百多人，连同搬来的家属达到五千人。每个职工的调动，国家平均要花一千元。
    另一项增加较多的人口，是高等学校和中等技术学校的师生和员工。成都市一年里增加了两万三千人。西安市，原来计划到1959年，才有五座高等学校，一万四千多学生，可是现在已有十六所高等学校，高等学校和中等技术学校的学生已经达到五万多人。记者参加了一次动力学院学生的座谈会，在座的十四个学生就来自九省一市。全国学生南来北往，不仅增加了新建城市的负担，并且由于学生生活习惯的不同，也发生了许多可以避免的麻烦和问题，增加了工作中的困难。
    最后一项增加的人口，就是“盲目”入城的农民了。其中，细分起来，有不小一部分是职工带来的。为什么“盲目”的人那么多呢？原来，有许多制度是鼓励农民进城的。以兰州和西安属于中央建筑工程部的两个建筑单位所属各公司为例，去年遵照中央有关部门的通知，凡是职工家属搬来的，都发路费和安家费。只是安家费一项，发的标准是职工本人按工资60％（在兰州竟有达到百分之百的），家属每人按职工工资的25％。此外，还有各种名目的补助费、水电补贴，租私人房屋房租超过一定数量，全由公家补助，这些补助，不带家属的职工，自然享受不到。这样，职工们何乐而不把家属搬进城来呢！据西北第二工程公司一个工段的调查，八十四户职工家属中，完全可以不搬来的就有三十九户。在搬来的家属里，不但有职工的直系亲属，并且有不少人带来了舅舅、姑母、表兄、表弟和小姨子。这种情况，造成了职工家庭人口多，生活困难，增加了城市房屋的紧张程度，也使许多在农村的生产者，进了城找不到工作，反而成了吃闲饭的。目前，属于中央建筑工程部所有单位，已经取消了这种不合理安家费的制度并准备采取每年定期放假的制度，给予家在农村的职工半个月到一个月的假期。可是，像这种鼓励农民进城的制度，在别的地区和厂矿，也不是没有的。
          问题的关键何在
    从上面的情况里，读者不难看出，由于我们对勤俭建国的意义了解不够，缺乏建设的经验，过去几年里，我们有许多钱是多花了的，并且由于多花了钱，增加了许多原来可以不发生的困难。如果能从这里面吸取经验，我们一定能够进一步贯彻执行勤俭建国的方针，把国家资金的每一元钱，都用得更加恰当，用同样多的钱，把工业建设得更多，更好。
