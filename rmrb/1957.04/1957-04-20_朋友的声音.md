    The Voice of a Friend
    People's Daily Commentator
    Mr. Inejiro Asanuma, head of the Japanese Socialist Party Goodwill Mission to China, delivered a speech in Beijing the night before last on promoting Sino-Japanese friendship. The Chinese people heard the voice of a friend from Japan.

    In his speech, Mr. Asanuma Inejiro expressed that the Japanese Socialist Party will make its utmost efforts to realize the normalization of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. Mr. Asanuma's statement has a solid foundation, because he demonstrated a clear attitude on the Taiwan issue, which is the key problem hindering the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations.

    When talking about the Taiwan issue, Mr. Asanuma Inejiro said that the attitude of the Japanese Socialist Party is: there is only one China, and Taiwan is a part of China; it does not recognize two Chinas; and it believes that the Taiwan issue is China's internal affair, and foreign countries should not interfere. This attitude of the Japanese Socialist Party is correct. The Chinese people have always believed that Taiwan is an inseparable part of China's territory and that the Taiwan issue is China's internal affair. The Chinese people will never agree to anyone who wants to play the conspiracy of "two Chinas." If someone tells the Japanese people that they want to promote Sino-Japanese friendship on the one hand, but wants to create so-called "two Chinas" on the other, this will certainly not promote the normalization of relations between China and Japan. Therefore, we welcome Mr. Asanuma Inejiro's statement on not recognizing "two Chinas" and striving to quickly restore diplomatic relations with China.

    As Mr. Asanuma Inejiro stated in his speech, the issue of restoring Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations is actually inseparable from the question of whether Japan continues to follow the path of pursuing US policies or takes the path of independence and autonomy. It is obvious that as long as the Japanese ruling authorities follow the United States for one day, and take the will of the United States as their own, the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations will be impossible to achieve for one day. In the eleven years since the war, Japan has suffered significant damage in various aspects due to following the United States. And today, when the United States is stepping up its "policy of strength" of expanding its arms race and establishing a vast network of atomic bases around the world, if Japan continues to willingly accept the rule of the United States, it will bring serious disasters to the Japanese people. Because the Japanese people realize this, they are more determined to demand that the Japanese authorities pursue a policy of independence and autonomy. Mr. Asanuma Inejiro pointed out in his speech that the Japanese Socialist Party advocates that Japan should not participate in any camp, implement an independent and autonomous policy, be good neighbors and friends, strive to expand the peace zone, and demand the withdrawal of foreign troops and the elimination of military bases in Japan and Asia. We are very pleased to see that these policies of the Japanese Socialist Party reflect the demands of the Japanese people.

    We believe that although there will be many twists and turns and difficulties in the future, Japan's complete independence will surely be realized. The day when Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations are restored and Japan becomes a close member of the Asian family will surely come. We hope that the gentlemen of the Japanese Socialist Party will make more contributions and achievements in the work of realizing Japan's national independence and promoting Sino-Japanese friendship.

    朋友的声音
    本报评论员
    日本社会党访华亲善使节团团长浅沼稻次郎先生，前天晚上在北京就促进中日友好问题发表了演说。中国人民听到了来自日本的朋友的声音。
    浅沼稻次郎先生在演说中表示，日本社会党将为实现中日邦交正常化而尽最大的努力。浅沼先生的这一表示是有坚实的基础的，因为他在台湾问题上表现了明智的态度，而这个问题正是阻碍中日恢复邦交的关键问题。
    浅沼稻次郎先生在谈到台湾问题的时候说，日本社会党的态度是：中国只有一个，台湾是中国的一部分；不承认有两个中国；认为台湾问题是中国的内政问题，外国不应干涉。日本社会党的这种态度是正确的。中国人民从来就认为台湾是中国领土的不可分割的一部分，台湾问题是中国的内政问题。任何人如果想玩弄“两个中国”的阴谋，中国人民都是决不答应的。如果有人一面向日本人民说要促进中日友好，一面却想制造所谓“两个中国”，这当然不能促进中日两国关系的正常化。因此我们欢迎浅沼稻次郎先生关于不承认“两个中国”和争取迅速同中国恢复邦交的表示。
    正如浅沼稻次郎先生在他的演说中所表明的，恢复中日邦交的问题，实际上是同日本继续走追随美国政策的道路还是走独立自主的道路的问题分不开的。很明显，只要日本执政当局一天跟着美国走，以美国的意志为意志，中日邦交的恢复就一天不可能实现。战后十一年来，日本由于追随美国，已经在各方面招致了重大的损害。而当美国加紧执行扩军备战的“实力政策”和在全世界广泛建立原子基地网的今天，日本如果继续甘心受美国的统治，更将给日本人民带来严重的灾难。日本人民因为认识到了这一点，所以更加坚决地要求日本当局奉行独立自主的政策。浅沼稻次郎先生在演说中指出，日本社会党主张日本不参加任何阵营，实行独立自主政策，睦邻友好，努力扩大和平地区，要求撤退在日本和亚洲的外国军队，取消军事基地。我们很高兴地看到，日本社会党的这些方针反映了日本人民的要求。
    我们相信，尽管前途还会有很多曲折和困难，日本的完全独立必将实现。中日两国邦交恢复、日本成为亚洲大家庭里的亲密的一员的日子，也必将到来。我们希望日本社会党的诸位先生们在实现日本的民族独立和促进中日友好的工作中有更多的贡献和成就。
