    The "Maestro" in the Zoo
    Liu Ying

    The "People's Daily" published on March 19th, on page 6, a TASS dispatch from New York on the 16th, saying that a new "maestro" has recently appeared in the American painting circles (naturally the bourgeois painting circles, same below). The "paintings" of this "maestro" have received "high" evaluations from certain painters. Some American newspapers even say that the works of some people in the American painting circles are not much better than those of this "maestro." The "ultra-modern abstract" artists, who are preparing to hold an exhibition, are preparing to "invite" this "maestro" to participate in their exhibition, and are even preparing to send a "delegation" to study the art of this "maestro."

    Who is this "maestro" who has caused a sensation in the American painting circles? It turns out to be Betsy, the chimpanzee in the Baltimore Zoo in the United States.

    This is truly "sensational" news. A beast can actually engage in artistic creation, and even surpass humans in this realm of mental activity unique to humans!

    Engels once said that after how many long years did the human hand gradually evolve in labor to such a perfect degree that it seemed to magically produce Raphael's paintings. However, the human hand that produced Raphael's paintings is now falling behind the "hand" of the chimpanzee. Has the human hand degenerated? And how quickly has it degenerated, so that it has fallen behind the chimpanzee in an instant?

    No one teaches a chimpanzee, and it not only will not paint, but will not even think of painting at all. Even if someone teaches it to paint, it is only acting on the instinct born of acquired habit. What it paints will never be better than what a seven- or eight-year-old child paints. I think, although we have no opportunity to see the great works of "Maestro" Betsy in person, the above judgment can be made in advance.

    However, it may seem like an absurd and ridiculous thing for us to regard a chimpanzee as a "maestro" of painting art, but for some ultra-modern abstract painters in the United States, it is not without reason. This Betsy is indeed qualified to be listed among the "maestros" of some ultra-modern abstract painters in the United States.

    Bourgeois painting has developed to the point where it has completely reached a dead end. Modern bourgeois painters, due to their class status, try their best to escape the real social life that is hostile to them, and refuse to express anything real, meaningful, or significant in life. The real objects of the real world are distorted, disintegrated, and deformed by all kinds of morbid fantasies and fantasies linked to idealism and mysticism. Thus, various deformed and incomplete images, various geometric shapes, crystals, various abstract and mysterious symbols, and chaotic fragments of shapes and colors appear on the screen... Such "paintings" can indeed be painted by chimpanzees. The American newspapers say that the works of some people in the American painting circles are not much better than Betsy's, which is a very pertinent remark and not an overestimation of Betsy.

    It is entirely understandable that the "ultra-modern abstract" artists attach special importance to Betsy. I think that the "delegation" they send to study Betsy's "masterpieces" will be of great benefit to promoting their so-called "ultra-modern abstract art," and Betsy's being "invited" to participate in their upcoming exhibition will also make the exhibition's visitors and buyers slightly more enthusiastic.

    Worshiping a chimpanzee as a "maestro" of painting art best illustrates to what extent modern bourgeois painting art has degenerated.

    动物园里的“巨匠”
    刘萤
    “人民日报”3月19日第六版上登了塔斯社纽约16日发出的一条消息，说美国绘画界（自然是资产阶级的绘画界，下同）最近出现了一位新的“巨匠”，这个“巨匠”的“画”得到了某些画家“很高的”评价。某些美国报纸还说美国绘画界有些人的作品比这位“巨匠”好不了多少。正在筹备开展览会的“超现代抽象派”准备“邀请”这位“巨匠”参加他们的展览会，而且还准备派一个“代表团”去研究这位“巨匠”的艺术。
    这位轰动美国绘画界的“巨匠”是谁呢？原来是美国巴尔的摩动物园里的黑猩猩别特西。
    这真是一则“耸人听闻”的消息。野兽居然能进行艺术创作，而且在这一为人类所特有的精神活动的领域中超过了人！
    恩格斯曾经说过，人类的手不知经过了多么漫长的年代，才在劳动中逐渐进化到如此完善的程度，以致仿佛是凭着魔力似地产生了拉菲尔的绘画。然而，产生过拉菲尔的绘画的人类的手今天却赶不上黑猩猩的“手”了。人类的手难道退化了么？而退化又何其如此之速，以致一下就退到了黑猩猩的后面？
    猩猩没有人教它，它不但不会画，而且根本就不会想到要画画。即使人把它教会画画了，它也不过是凭着为后天习惯所生的本能在那里动作罢了。它画出来的东西，也绝不会比一个七、八岁的小孩画的更好。我想，我们虽无缘亲见“巨匠”别特西的大作，以上的断语却是可以先下的。
    不过，把黑猩猩奉为绘画艺术的“巨匠”，这在我们看来虽是愚不可及的荒诞的怪事，但对美国的某些超现代抽象派的画家说来，却不是没有理由的。这位别特西确实有资格被列入美国的某些超现代抽象派的画家的“巨匠”之林。
    资产阶级的绘画发展到现在，已经完全走到了穷途末路。现代资产阶级的画家，由于他们所处的阶级地位，竭力逃开那与他们相敌对的现实社会生活，拒绝表现生活中任何真实的、有内容的、有意义的东西。现实世界的真实的物象，被种种病态的狂想和种种与唯心主义、神秘主义哲学相联系的狂想加以歪曲、支解、变形。于是在画面上出现了各种畸形的、残缺的形象，各种几何形体、结晶体，各种抽象的、神秘的符号，形与色的杂乱的碎片……。这样的“画”，确是黑猩猩有可能画得出来的。美国报纸说美国绘画界有些人的作品比别特西的好不了多少，这真是很中肯的话，并非对于别特西的过誉。
    “超现代抽象派”的特别看重别特西是完全可以理解的。我想，他们派出的“代表团”对别特西的“大作”的研究，对宣扬他们的所谓“超现代抽象主义”，定会大有裨益，而别特西的被“邀请”参加他们即将举行的展览会，也定会使展览会的参观者和订购者稍微踊跃一些。
    奉黑猩猩为绘画艺术的“巨匠”，最好地说明了现代资产阶级的绘画艺术已经堕落到何等地步。
