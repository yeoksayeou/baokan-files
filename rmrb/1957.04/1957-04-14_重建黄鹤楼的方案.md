Plans to Rebuild the Yellow Crane Tower

With the imminent completion of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, the Yellow Crane Tower will also reappear before the people of Wuhan in a more magnificent form.

Currently, six preliminary design schemes have been drafted, all using the summit of Sheshan's Gaoguan Mountain as the location for the tower. The Gaoguan Mountain summit has an elevation of eighty-five meters, the highest point along the Wuchang riverside. Once the Yellow Crane Tower is built here, people "ascending this tower to survey the surroundings" will be able to have an unobstructed view of the entire Wuhan city area, as well as the East Lake scenic area and the Qingshan industrial zone. Naturally, Hanyang and Parrot Island will also remain clearly visible.

More people favor continuing the design based on the fourth scheme, while many also favor continuing the design based on the sixth scheme. The fourth scheme's design features a main building form similar to the architectural style of the Qing Dynasty Yellow Crane Tower: a towering and magnificent structure. The sixth scheme is based on the Song Dynasty Yellow Crane Tower: with winding corridors and balustrades, convenient for leisurely strolls. (Wen Feng)

    重建黄鹤楼的方案
    随着武汉长江大桥的即将建成，黄鹤楼也将以更加雄伟的姿态重新出现在武汉人民的眼前。
    现在初步设计了六种方案，都是以蛇山高冠山顶作为建楼地址的。高冠山顶标高八十五公尺，是武昌滨江一线的最高点。黄鹤楼在这里建成后，人们“登兹楼以四望”，可以把整个武汉市市区以及东湖风景区、青山工业区一览无余，汉阳和鹦鹉洲当然也仍然历历在目。
    赞成以第四种方案为基础继续进行设计的人较多，赞成以第六种方案为继续设计的基础的人也不少。第四种方案设计的主楼形式近似清代黄鹤楼建筑风格：危楼高耸，颇为壮观。第六种方案以宋代黄鹤楼为蓝本：回廊曲槛，便于流连。　（闻风）
