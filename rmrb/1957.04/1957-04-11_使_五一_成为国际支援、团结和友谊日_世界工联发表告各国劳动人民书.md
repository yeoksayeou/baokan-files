Xinhua News Agency, Prague, April 10th. The World Federation of Trade Unions issued a "May Day" letter to the working people of all countries in Prague on the 9th, calling for this year's May 1st to be transformed into a day of international support, solidarity, and friendship for working people around the world.

The World Federation of Trade Unions hopes that "May Day" will become a new source of encouragement for working people to take joint action to achieve their urgent and pressing demands. These demands include striving to raise living standards and improve working conditions, eliminating wage discrimination, disarmament, ending colonial wars, ceasing hostilities against the Algerian people, abolishing the colonial system, and granting all peoples the right to self-determination.

The letter to the working people of all countries also pointed out the significance of strengthening the solidarity of working people, calling for overcoming the obstacles caused by division, unremittingly striving to win unity and consolidate fraternal ties between trade union organizations, and stopping the activities of saboteurs in the ranks of the working class.

The letter said that working people must unite to jointly strive for economic and social progress, for peace and the destruction of the forces of war; the working people and peoples of oppressed countries must unite with the working people and peoples of other countries to jointly wage the historical struggle for independence and national liberation, the struggle for trade union rights and democratic freedoms, and the protection of these rights and freedoms, and to thwart all reactionary attempts to obstruct fraternal cooperation between the working people and trade unions of countries with different economic and social systems.

    使“五一”成为国际支援、团结和友谊日
    世界工联发表告各国劳动人民书
    新华社布拉格10日电　世界工会联合会9日在布拉格发表了“五一”节告世界各国劳动人民书，要求把今年的5月1日变成全世界劳动人民国际支援、团结和友谊日。
    世界工联希望“五一”节成为劳动人民为争取实现自己刻不容缓的迫切要求而共同行动的新的鼓舞力量。这些要求是争取提高生活水平和改善劳动条件、取消在工资方面的歧视、裁军、结束殖民主义战争、停止对阿尔及利亚人民的敌对行动、废除殖民主义制度、给予各国人民以自决权等。
    告世界各国劳动人民书中还指出加强劳动人民团结的意义，号召克服由于分裂而造成的障碍，坚持不懈地致力于争取团结和巩固工会组织之间的兄弟联系，并且制止工人阶级队伍中的破坏分子的活动。
    书中说，劳动人民必须团结起来共同争取经济进步和社会进步，争取和平和摧毁战争势力；被压迫国家的劳动人民和人民必须同其他国家的劳动人民和人民团结起来，共同进行争取独立和民族解放的历史斗争，进行争取工会权利和民主自由以及保护这种权利和自由的斗争，挫败一切试图阻挠不同经济制度和社会制度的国家的劳动人民和工会之间的兄弟合作的反动企图。
