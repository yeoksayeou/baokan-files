	The United States Hopes for Garcia's Election as Philippine President
	An editorial in the "Nation" weekly, to be published on the 13th, states that the White House, the State Department, and the Defense Department all privately hope that the current Philippine President Garcia will be elected as the next president in the November election. This is mainly because the U.S. government dislikes Garcia's rival, Recto, because Recto once launched a campaign against the unequal U.S.-Philippine military base agreement.

	Japan Opposes the Western European "Common Market"
	The Japanese government recently sent a memorandum to the six relevant countries of France, West Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, opposing the Western European "Common Market" for discriminating against Japan in tariffs and trade. This is the first time the Japanese government has expressed a formal attitude towards the Western European "Common Market".

	Syngman Rhee's Adopted Son's Illegal Enrollment Causes Strike
	Students at Seoul National University's Law School went on strike on the 10th to protest the illegal enrollment of Syngman Rhee's adopted son, Lee Kang-seok, without an examination. Lee Kang-seok was adopted as Syngman Rhee's legal heir on March 26. Lee Kang-seok's father, Lee Ki-poong, is a close confidant of Syngman Rhee. This adoption is considered an indication that Syngman Rhee has chosen Lee Ki-poong as his successor.

	Train Collision in the Union of South Africa
	A crowded electric commuter train carrying workers from Cape Town to the suburbs collided with an oncoming train near Woodstock, two miles from Cape Town, on the night of the 8th, killing at least twenty-four people and injuring seventy-four. This is the biggest train collision in the Union of South Africa in thirty years.
