Xinhua News Agency, 12th — The State Economic Commission has decided to allocate a batch of special funds to localities for the construction of small coal mines and local metallurgical industries this year.

　　Of this special fund, 11.6 million yuan has been allocated to nineteen provinces including Hebei, Shanxi, Fujian, and Qinghai for the construction or renovation of forty small coal mines. These small coal mines are expected to increase coal production by 540,000 tons this year. People familiar with coal mine construction say that building these small coal mines can save investment compared to building modern large-scale coal mines. It takes about 20 million yuan to build a modernly equipped coal mine with an annual output of 600,000 tons, and it takes two years before coal can be produced.

　　The special fund for the construction of local metallurgical industry totals 12.4 million yuan. This money will be used to build twelve small blast furnaces and many indigenous iron furnaces, indigenous coke ovens, and iron mines in fourteen provinces including Hunan, Jiangsu, Guizhou, and Guangxi. After these projects are put into production this year and next year, they can produce 400,000 tons of pig iron annually. These pig iron will be mainly used to manufacture agricultural tools such as hoes and sickles, and household appliances such as stoves.

　　In addition to this special fund allocated by the State Economic Commission, this year, various provinces and cities have also allocated more than 80 million yuan from local capital construction investment to develop local coal and metallurgical industries.

    国家拨款发展地方煤铁工业
    新华社12日讯　国家经济委员会决定拨给地方一批专用款，作为今年建设小煤窑和地方冶金工业用。
    这笔专用款中的一千一百六十万元，分配给了河北、山西、福建、青海等十九个省，用来新建或改建四十个小煤窑。这些小煤窑今年预计可以增产五十四万吨煤。熟悉煤矿建设情况的人说，建设这些小煤窑比建设现代化的大煤矿能够节省投资。建设一个年产六十万吨的现代化装备的煤矿，需要两千万元左右的资金，而且两年以后才能产煤。
    用于建设地方冶金工业的专款共一千二百四十万元。这些钱将用来在湖南、江苏、贵州、广西等十四个省，建设十二座小高炉和许多土铁炉、土焦炉以及铁矿等。这些工程在今年和明年投入生产以后，每年可以生产四十万吨生铁。这些生铁将主要用来制造锄头、镰刀等农具和火炉等日常生活用具。
    除国家经济委员会拨出的这笔专用款以外，今年各省市还从地方基本建设的投资中拨出了八千多万元，用以发展地方煤炭和冶金工业。
