Xinhua News Agency, Karamay, 19th. The basic construction projects of the Karamay Oilfield have successively started since the beginning of April. More than 7,000 construction workers have now entered the construction site.

This year, Karamay will build more than 182,000 square meters of industrial and civil buildings, including three factories such as a comprehensive machine repair factory, a turbine drill repair factory, and an internal combustion engine repair factory, as well as a 3,000-kilowatt power station, a radioactive logging laboratory, and more than 300 dormitories. The first phase of the 150-kilometer-long Du-Ke oil pipeline to the Dushanzi Refinery will also be carried out this year. In addition, 300 kilometers of roads and a number of water pipelines will also be built this year.

By the end of this year, a base for petroleum industrial exploration with an initial scale will appear here. The current tense situation in the oil area in terms of water supply, transportation, machine repair, and housing will thus be alleviated.

    克拉玛依今年的建设规模
    新华社克拉玛依19日电　克拉玛依油田的基本建设工程在4月初以来陆续动工。目前已有七千多名建筑工人进入工地。
    今年克拉玛依将建设十八万二千多平方公尺的工业和民用建筑，其中包括综合机修厂、涡轮钻具修理厂、内燃机修理厂等三座工厂和一个三千瓩的发电站，还有放射性测井实验室和三百多幢宿舍。通往独山子炼油厂去的一百五十公里长的独—克输油管，也将在今年进行第一期工程。此外还有三百公里公路和若干输水管道，也要在今年建设起来。
    到今年底，这里就将出现一个石油工业勘探的初具规模的基地。目前油区的给水、运输、机修、居住等方面的紧张状况将因而得到缓和。
