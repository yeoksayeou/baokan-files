Agricultural Proverbs (Continued 3)
　　Collected by Su Keqin
　　IV. On diligent cultivation: “Plow diligently, harrow four times, and hoe eight times.”
　　“Barren land fears deep plowing” (referring to the fact that barren land can be improved by deep plowing). “Deep plowing is as good as applying fertilizer.”
　　“Deep plowing by an inch is worth a load of fertilizer.” “If you can plow the autumn land, don't leave it until the next year.” “Scratching the surface in autumn is better than plowing ten times in spring.” “It's better to plow the land in autumn than to have surplus grain.” “Early plowing doesn't require asking, tree leaves and grass roots serve as topdressing.” “Early plowing yields no late wheat.” “Golden land in August, silver land in September, chaff pit in October” (meaning the earlier the land is plowed, the better). “Three parts plowing, seven parts covering.” “More harrowing, more covering, emerges completely and grows fast.” “Not afraid of small seedlings, but afraid of clods biting.”
　　“Sowing wheat is not afraid of grass, but afraid of clods biting.” “Digging around the edge of the field, grows a circle.” “If the field terraces are long (referring to the field terraces), the crops will be abundant” (meaning the crops grow well). “If there is little spring rain, use water to irrigate; if there is a lot of summer rain, open ditches.” “Weed diligently, the soil will be loose, and you can eat all the grain you harvest.” “Money can't buy a dry May, diligent weeding and hoeing ensures enough food.” “The hoe has water, the hoe has fire” (meaning hoeing is effective in preventing drought and flooding). “Hoe the millet eight times and eat round rice (round rice refers to plump grains).” “Hoe the millet eight times and starve the dog (meaning cooking rice without excessive water), hoe the wheat four times and level the ditches (meaning the wheat grains grow plump).” “Hoe the cotton eight times, and the bolls will grow as big as eggs.” “Turn over the yam vines diligently, and when digging them up, you'll need a cart to load them” (meaning diligent turning of yam vines can increase production; but vines that are short and brittle should not be turned over too much).
