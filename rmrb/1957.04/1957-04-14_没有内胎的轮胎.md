    Tubeless Tires
    The first batch of "tubeless tires," marking a new direction in China's tire development, has been produced by the Rubber Industry Research Institute of the Ministry of Chemical Industry. These tires are not prone to air leaks. During testing, one tubeless tire was punctured in four places with nails and was still able to safely drive from the Summer Palace in Beijing back to Tianjin.
    Because there is no inner tube, the friction between the inner tube and the outer tire is reduced. The tire does not heat up as often, and its service life can be extended by about 10% to 20% compared to tires with inner tubes. The amount of rubber required to make this type of tire is also less than that required for tires with inner tubes.

    没有内胎的轮胎
    第一批标志我国轮胎发展新方向的“无内胎轮胎”，已经由化学工业部橡胶工业研究所生产出来。这种轮胎不容易跑气，试验的时候，在一条无内胎轮胎上用钉子穿透四处，仍然能安全地从北京颐和园开回天津。
    由于没有内胎，减少了内胎和外胎的摩擦，轮胎不致时常发热，使用寿命比带内胎的轮胎可延长10％到20％左右。制作这种轮胎所需的橡胶也比带内胎的轮胎节省。
