The Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to clearly explain the truth about the national economic situation to the masses, conduct in-depth education on building the country and managing households through diligence and thrift, and require commercial departments to do a good job in organizing sources of goods and supply, and strengthen market research and management.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, April 21st: After analyzing and studying the current market situation, the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has proposed a series of measures to resolve the contradiction between current market commodity supply and consumption demands.

These measures are: Immediately launch a large-scale publicity and education campaign on the current market issues among the people in both urban and rural areas of the province. Clearly explain the truth about the current national economic situation to the masses, especially the reasons for the price increases of certain commodities or the implementation of new supply measures, so that people realize that the current difficulties are temporary difficulties in our progress, and call on everyone to consciously overcome them. Conduct in-depth education among the masses on building the country through diligence and thrift, running enterprises through diligence and thrift, running cooperatives through diligence and thrift, and managing households through diligence and thrift, repeatedly explaining the principle that the improvement of people's lives can only be gradually improved on the basis of production development. Explain that according to China's actual situation, due to backward production and agriculture's inability to escape the impact of natural disasters, it is inevitable that some materials will sometimes be abundant and sometimes scarce, and it is also reasonable for the prices of certain commodities to fluctuate up and down. This publicity campaign must be known to every household and deeply rooted in people's hearts.

Require commercial departments to vigorously organize sources of goods and promptly do a good job in commodity allocation. Except for certain major commodities that are sold according to plan, general commodities must overcome the idea of reluctance to sell and try to ensure supply.

Strengthen market research and management. At present, except for the varieties for which the state has designated price increases, all other prices must be frozen immediately and cannot be arbitrarily raised. In the past, the prices of handicrafts that have been arbitrarily raised too much must be lowered. If the prices of certain varieties are indeed unreasonable, they must be reported to the province for approval before they can be adjusted. The free market must be strengthened in management. The prices of commodities in the free market that are too high must be appropriately managed. In order to strengthen the leadership of market work, it has been decided to organize a market management committee to uniformly manage the urban and rural markets of the province; and to establish a price bureau to uniformly manage the price work of the province. And order all cities and counties to also establish specialized agencies or personnel to manage market prices.

Since the beginning of this year, the overall situation of commodity supply in the Liaoning market has been trending towards easing and basic stability. According to statistics from the commercial departments, the sales volume of state-owned commerce in the province in the first quarter of this year decreased by 24.1% compared with the fourth quarter of last year. The amount of bank savings in the first quarter is also rising. However, on the other hand, because the contradiction between the increase in people's purchasing power and the growth of production has not been resolved, the tension in the supply of certain commodities still exists. In particular, since the beginning of the year, in order to meet the needs of developing production and national construction, the state has successively made appropriate upward adjustments to the prices of several major commodities such as salt, pork, woolen cloth, soybean oil, and high-grade cigarettes, and the state has adopted new supply measures for certain materials. In addition, the publicity work has not kept up after the price adjustment measures were taken, and there are also adverse effects such as the free price increase of certain handicraft products and the high-priced sale of local products and by-products in the free market. In recent times, some consumers have developed a sense of tension and complaint. Reflected in the market, some new abnormal phenomena have appeared again since March. After a specific analysis of these situations, the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to take the above measures.

    怎样解决当前市场供求间的矛盾
    中共辽宁省委决定：把国家经济情况的真相向群众讲清楚，深入进行勤俭治国、勤俭持家的教育，要求商业部门做好组织货源和供应工作，加强市场的研究和管理。
    据新华社沈阳21日电　中共辽宁省委员会在分析和研究了当前市场情况以后，已经提出一系列解决当前市场商品供应和消费要求之间矛盾的办法。
    这些办法是：立即在全省城乡人民群众中大张旗鼓地开展关于当前市场问题的宣传教育运动。把目前国家经济情况的真相公开向群众讲清楚，特别是对某些商品提价或采取新的供应措施的原因，向群众说明，使人们认识到目前的困难是我们前进中的暂时困难；号召大家来自觉地克服。向群众深入进行勤俭建国、勤俭办企业、勤俭办社和勤俭持家的教育，反复说明人民生活的改善只能在生产发展的基础上逐渐改善的道理。说明根据我国的实际情况，由于生产落后和农业还不能摆脱天灾的影响，某些物资有时多有时少是必然的，某些商品的价格有上调和下降的现象也是合理的。这一宣传运动，必须做到家喻户晓，深入人心。
    要求商业部门大力组织货源，及时做好商品调拨工作，除了某些主要商品按计划销售外，对一般商品要克服惜售思想，尽量保证供应。
    加强市场的研究和管理工作。目前除全国指定提价的品种以外，其它一律立即冻结，不得任意提价。过去手工业品任意提价过多的要降下来。某些品种价格确实不合理的，必须报省批准才能调整。自由市场必须加强管理。自由市场的商品价格过高的要加以适当管理。为了加强市场工作的领导，决定组织市场管理委员会，统一管理全省城乡市场；成立物价局，统一管理全省物价工作。并责成各市、县也要设立专门管理市场物价的机构或人员。
    自今年年初以来，辽宁省市场商品供应总的情况是趋向缓和和基本稳定的。据商业部门统计，今年第一季度全省国营商业的卖钱额比去年第四季度下降了24.1％。第一季度银行的储蓄额也在上升。但是另一方面，由于人民购买力的提高和生产增长的矛盾还没有解决，某些商品供应的紧张情况依然存在。特别是年初以来，为了适应发展生产和国家建设的需要，国家相继对食盐、猪肉、呢绒、豆油和高级纸烟几种主要商品的价格进行了适当上调，国家对某些物资采取了新的供应措施，加上采取调价措施以后宣传工作没有跟上，还有某些手工业产品自由提价和自由市场高价出售土产品、副产品的不良影响，最近一个时期，便有一些消费者产生了紧张和埋怨情绪。反映在市场上，从3月份以来又出现了一些新的不正常现象。中共辽宁省委员会对这些情况进行了具体分析以后，决定采取上述措施。
