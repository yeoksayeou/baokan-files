    Remembering Hainan (and another poem)
    Jing Yandun
    Yesterday I left the beautiful Hainan,
    Now traveling in the mountains of eastern Guangxi,
    Beloved land, equally enchanting,
    Though the scenery is already different.
    Fertile paddy fields fill the valleys,
    Rapeseed flowers bloom before and behind villages,
    The sun gently kisses the fields,
    Mountains and peaks greet me along the way.
    Ah, before me is the scenery of the vast interior,
    Yet Hainan's image appears in my mind,
    Words cannot express the myriad feelings in my heart,
    I only feel that Yulin is distant as a dream.
    Our homeland is so vast,
    Not to mention from south to north, from west to east;
    A message to comrades guarding the frontier,
    Treasure every inch of our land...
    Spring Arrives in Hainan
    Who says Hainan Island doesn't have spring and winter?
    But spring and winter are indeed different!
    Trees sprout layers of tender leaves,
    The color of the flowers is also richer and redder.
    The mountain colors also seem greener,
    The birdsong also seems more melodious,
    Rice seedlings sway left and right on the water surface,
    As if welcoming the gentle breeze.
    Villages and communes are busy,
    Figures seem to be moving in a mirror;
    The land shines with freshness,
    Ah, as if it has been replaced with a layer of velvet!
          1957.2.7．Dawn

    忆海南（外一首）
    井岩盾
    昨天离开了绚丽的海南，
    此刻穿行在桂东的山中，
    亲爱的土地同样迷人，
    虽然景色已经不同。
    肥美的水田满山满谷，
    村前村后菜花丛丛，
    阳光温柔地吻着原野，
    山峦和奇峰一路迎送。
    呵，眼前是无限内地的景色，
    头脑却现着海南的图形，
    说不出心里的万般滋味，
    只觉得榆林已遥远若梦。
    我们的国土如此辽阔，
    不必说从南到北，从西到东；
    寄语保卫边疆的同志，
    每寸国土多珍重……
    春到海南
    谁说海南岛不分春冬？
    但春天和冬天究竟不同！
    树木生出了层层嫩叶，
    花朵的颜色也更浓更红。
    山色也仿佛更青翠了，
    鸟叫也仿佛更加好听，
    稻苗在水面左右摇摆，
    仿佛欢迎着阵阵的轻风。
    村村社社忙碌起来，
    人影仿佛活动在镜中；
    土地新鲜得闪闪发光，
    呵，仿佛又换了一层丝绒！
