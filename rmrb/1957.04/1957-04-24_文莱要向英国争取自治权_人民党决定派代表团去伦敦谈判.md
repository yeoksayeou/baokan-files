Xinhua News Agency, Singapore, 23rd. The chairman of the People's Party of Brunei, located in central British North Borneo, Azahari, said yesterday in Singapore that Brunei hopes to obtain autonomy from Britain immediately.

Azahari said that his party's recent congress decided to send a delegation to London to negotiate the issue of autonomy with the British Colonial Office. The delegation may go to London in September this year.

He said that if the negotiations with the British government fail, the Brunei People's Party will request the Asian and African countries in the United Nations to turn Brunei into a trusteeship, and will launch public demonstrations to protest.

Brunei covers an area of approximately 2,500 square miles and has a population of approximately 66,000. The area produces oil. Oil royalties are the source of most of the local government's revenue. According to Azahari, Brunei's administration is currently managed by a local council, whose fourteen members are all appointed by the Sultan and British advisors. He said that there are approximately 16,000 members of the People's Party.

    文莱要向英国争取自治权
    人民党决定派代表团去伦敦谈判
    据新华社23日讯　新加坡消息：英属北婆罗洲中部文莱的人民党主席阿扎哈里昨天在新加坡说，文莱希望立即从英国取得自治权。
    阿扎哈里说，他的党最近召开的代表大会决定派一个代表团到伦敦去同英国殖民地部谈判自治问题。这个代表团可能在今年9月到伦敦去。
    他说，如果同英国政府进行的谈判失败，文莱人民党将通过联合国中的亚非国家要求联合国把文莱变成一个托管地，并且将发动公众举行示威来表示抗议。
    文莱的面积约二千五百平方英里，人口约六万六千人。当地出产石油。石油开采税是当地政府绝大部分收入的来源。据阿扎哈里说，文莱的行政目前是由当地的议会管理的，议会中的十四名议员全部由苏丹和英籍顾问官委任。他说，人民党党员约有一万六千人。
