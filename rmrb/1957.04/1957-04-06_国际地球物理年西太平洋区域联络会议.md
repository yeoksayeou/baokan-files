    International Geophysical Year Western Pacific Regional Liaison Conference

    In order to study the laws of large-scale geophysical evolution, the International Geophysical Year, inheriting the tradition of scientific cooperation from the two international polar years in the past seventy-five years, will begin geophysical observations for a period of eighteen months from July 1st this year. In terms of the breadth of its scientific activities, the large number of observation stations, and the global reach of scientific expeditions, this is the largest international scientific cooperation activity to date. To coordinate the scientific plans of countries in the Western Pacific region and make timely preparations, a Western Pacific Regional Liaison Conference on the International Geophysical Year was held in Tokyo, Japan, from February 25th to March 2nd. The Chinese National Committee for the International Geophysical Year sent a delegation of eight people, including myself and Tu Changwang, to attend the conference.

    After the opening of the conference, it was divided into twelve groups according to the projects stipulated by the International Geophysical Year for discussion and consultation. The conference made suggestions and resolutions on four aspects: increasing stations and observation projects, unifying observation methods and comparing instruments with each other, transmitting alert information and exchanging data, and technical regulations. This can adjust and supplement the scientific plans of various countries regarding the International Geophysical Year, and also strengthen the relationship between the International Geophysical Year Special Committee and the Western Pacific region. To facilitate the discussion of scientific plans, the conference also invited relevant scientists to give lectures on artificial satellites, nuclear radiation, cosmic rays, and Japan's rocket launching work, which aroused great interest among the delegates.

    During the conference, the Chinese delegation extensively contacted scientists from Japan and other countries. On the one hand, we introduced the progress of geophysics in New China, and on the other hand, we exchanged opinions with them and learned from their new achievements. During visits to universities and scientific research institutions in Nagano, Osaka, Kobe, Kyoto, and Tokyo, we further communicated with Japanese scientists, and visited and learned about their experimental and theoretical research work in geophysics.

    From the visits, we saw that Japan has done a lot of research in seismology, geomagnetism, oceanography, and other fields. In other aspects of geophysics, they fully utilize modern new technologies. Each of their laboratories has one or two experienced electronic physics experts participating in the work, and they make research and experimental equipment precise and automated. For example, thanks to the cooperation of electronic physicists, radio astronomy at the Tokyo Astronomical Observatory has made great progress. They have discovered many new observational facts through the use of new technologies, thereby promoting the research of astronomical theory. In seismology, they have adopted electronic circuits and magnetic tape recording methods, and are developing towards remote control. In other geophysical laboratories, precision instruments for automatic control are also designed using radio technology for experiments and observations. The Japanese geophysicists we contacted all deeply felt the importance of close cooperation between China and Japan. China is a continental country in East Asia, and Japan is an island country. Without various geophysical data on the mainland, it is very difficult to conduct scientific research. For example, without China's meteorological data, it is difficult for Japan to make accurate weather forecasts, and meteorological research is even more difficult. At the same time, Japan has made considerable progress in geophysics after the war, which can also give us a lot of help.

    国际地球物理年西太平洋区域联络会议
    为了研究大范围地球物理演变的规律，国际地球物理年承袭过去七十五年内两次国际极年的科学合作的传统，将从今年7月1日开始举办为期十八个月的地球物理观测。就它的科学活动内容的广泛，观测台站很多和科学考察队的遍及全球来看，这是目前规模最大的一次国际科学合作的活动。为了调整西太平洋地区各国的科学计划，及时做好各项准备工作，于2月25日到3月2日在日本东京召开了关于国际地球物理年的西太平洋区域联络会议。中国国际地球物理年国家委员会曾派遣我和涂长望等八人组成代表团前往参加了这次会议。
    大会开幕后即按照国际地球物理年规定的项目，分为十二个小组进行讨论协商。大会分别对增加台站和观测项目、观测方法的统一和仪器的相互比较、警报情报传递和资料交换、技术规定四个方面，作出了建议和决议。这一方面可以使各国关于国际地球物理年的科学计划得到调整和补充，同时也密切了国际地球物理年专门委员会同西太平洋区域的关系。为了便于讨论科学计划，大会还分别邀请有关科学家对人造卫星、核子辐射、宇宙线以及日本施放火箭的工作作了讲演，引起到会代表极大的兴趣。
    中国代表团在会议进行中，广泛地同日本以及其他各国科学家进行接触，一方面介绍新中国地球物理学的进展情况，同时和他们交换意见，学习他们的新成就。在访问长野、大阪、神户、京都、东京各地大学和科学研究机关中，我们又进一步地同日本科学家交谈，参观并了解他们地球物理学的实验和理论研究工作。
    从参观访问中我们看到，日本在地震学、地磁学、海洋学等方面，曾经作出许多研究工作。地球物理学其他方面他们都充分运用现代新技术。他们每一个实验室内都有一两个有经验的电子物理学专家参加工作，并使研究实验装备精确化和自动化。例如，由于电子物理学家的合作，东京天文台的射电天文学得到很大的发展。他们通过新技术的运用发现了许多新的观测事实，从而推动了天文理论的研究。在地震方面，他们已采用电子线路和磁带记录方法，向远距控制发展。其他地球物理的实验室内，也都是利用无线电技术设计自动控制的精密仪器进行实验和观测的。我们接触到的日本地球物理学家，都深感到中日两国密切合作的重要。中国是东亚大陆，日本是岛国，没有大陆上各种地球物理的资料，进行科学研究是非常困难的。例如没有中国的气象资料，日本就很难做好天气预告，气象研究工作更有困难。同时日本在地球物理方面，战后有长足的进展，也可以给我们很多的帮助。
