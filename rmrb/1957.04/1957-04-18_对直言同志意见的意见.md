Opinions on Comrade Zhiyan's Opinion

After reading Comrade Zhiyan's article "How Should We View the 'Aomori No. 5' Incident?" in the April 14th People's Daily, I found it very instructive and believe it should be discussed with a sincere and serious attitude. My article "Learn from Last Year's Experience to Better Promote Agricultural Production Increase Measures," published in the March 19th People's Daily, addressed the issues in the promotion of agricultural production increase measures as a whole. The estimation of some shortcomings and errors that occurred in the promotion of production increase measures last year was also measured from the perspective of the overall work's achievements. The promotion of "Aomori No. 5" early japonica rice was only cited as an example, and there was no intention to conceal errors as Comrade Zhiyan stated. Since Comrade Zhiyan believes the entire article is correct, and only has differing opinions on the "Aomori No. 5" statement in principle, I will further discuss my views on the promotion of "Aomori No. 5" early japonica here.

The Promotion of "Aomori No. 5" is a Failure in the Rice Cultivation System Reform

The reform of the rice cultivation system in 1956 was effective. The area of single-season rice converted to double-season rice increased by more than 32 million mu compared to 1955; the area of intercropping rice converted to continuous cropping rice increased by more than 7.09 million mu compared to 1955; and the area of indica rice converted to japonica rice increased by more than 11 million mu. The total area of these three reforms exceeded three times the cumulative area from 1953 to 1955, and it is estimated that grain production increased by about 5 billion jin. The failure of the promotion of "Aomori No. 5" is a failure of one project in the basically successful reform of the rice cultivation system.

"Aomori No. 5" early japonica was mainly promoted in Hunan and Hubei last year. Hunan promoted 255,310 mu (the 215,900 mu published in the "People's Daily" on October 12, 1956, did not include the figures for state-owned farms); Hubei promoted more than 500,000 mu. The situation in the two provinces was roughly that the yield per mu decreased by about 100 jin compared to early indica rice. There were also areas where large-scale production increases occurred. Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, planted a total of 18,675 mu of "Aomori No. 5" early japonica, accounting for about 10.3% of the county's early rice area of 181,362 mu. The average yield per mu was 570 jin, an increase of 10.88% compared to the average yield of 514 jin per mu for local early indica rice, and a large area of high-yield production emerged (the 1452.2 mu of "Aomori No. 5" early japonica in Dongshan Township of the county achieved an average yield of 703 jin per mu, an increase of 21.2% compared to the average yield of 580 jin per mu for local early indica rice); in Echeng County, there were small areas with yields exceeding 1000 jin per mu. The 19.6 mu of "Aomori No. 5" planted by the Xinqiaozui Agricultural Cooperative in Hanshou County, Hunan Province, also achieved an average yield of 624 jin per mu.

The Promotion of Japonica Rice to the South is Based on Evidence

The promotion of "Aomori No. 5" to the South is based on certain evidence. The South has a long history of planting japonica rice. The Taihu area has long had a large area of japonica rice; Qianyang, Hunan, also has a considerable area of japonica rice; the Li ethnic brothers in Hainan Island mostly plant japonica rice; the Baise Prefecture in Guangxi also has tens of thousands of mu of japonica rice, with yields reaching 800 to 900 jin per mu; Yunnan mostly plants japonica rice in areas above 1500 meters above sea level; Sichuan, Guizhou, Hubei, Jiangxi, Fujian, and other provinces also have many areas planting japonica rice. After the Japanese imperialists occupied Taiwan, they began introducing japonica rice "Penglai Rice" to Taiwan in 1900 and achieved success. During the Japanese imperialist rule in Taiwan, japonica rice accounted for more than 60% of the total rice area.

In recent years, the promotion of japonica rice planted in the North to the South has been basically successful. Japonica rice has higher yields under conditions of sufficient fertilizer and intensive cultivation; the quality of japonica rice is generally better than that of indica rice; japonica rice is more cold-resistant and less prone to seedling rot; japonica rice is drought-resistant and early-maturing, making it easier to convert from single-season rice to double-season rice. In 1956, the area of indica rice converted to japonica rice increased by more than 11 million mu, and yields were increased in the vast majority of areas (Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Sichuan, and other provinces).

The problem is more prominent in Hunan and Hubei. According to materials from Hubei Province, the promotion of early and mid-season japonica resulted in yield reductions more often than yield increases; however, the yields were extremely uneven, with high yields reaching around 1,000 jin per mu and low yields of 100 to 200 jin or even tens of jin; the promotion of single-season and double-season late japonica generally increased yields, and the yields were more balanced. The province planted 500,000 mu of early japonica, with an average yield of 314 jin per mu, a decrease of 24.5% compared to the average yield of 416 jin per mu for early indica rice in the same year, and a decrease of 20% compared to the average yield of 390 jin per mu for early indica rice in 1955. Mid-season japonica was planted on 1.5 million mu, with an average yield of 455 jin per mu, a decrease of 5.6% compared to the average yield of 482 jin per mu for mid-season indica rice in the same year, and an increase of 6.8% compared to the average yield of 426 jin per mu for mid-season indica rice in 1955. Single-season late rice was planted on 900,000 mu, with an average yield of 650 jin per mu, an increase of 34.8% compared to mid-season indica rice in the same year, and an increase of 52.5% compared to mid-season indica rice in 1955. Double-season late japonica was planted on 500,000 mu, with an average yield of 385 jin per mu, an increase of 28.3% compared to the average yield of 300 jin per mu for late indica rice in the same year. In total, the province increased rice production by about 100 million jin due to the promotion of japonica rice.

In Hunan, most of the early japonica "Aomori No. 5" saw reduced yields, with only a few seeing increased yields. The average yield per mu was more than 100 jin less than early indica rice. Early japonica No. 3, No. 4, and No. 16 generally saw increased yields; the average yield per mu reached 500 to 600 jin. Mid-season japonica had an average yield of about 300 jin per mu, a decrease of more than 20% compared to the provincial average yield of 368 jin per mu for mid-season rice. Late japonica generally saw increased yields. According to statistics from Changde Prefecture, Datong Lake, Xidongting Farm, and parts of the county, the average yield per mu for single-season late japonica reached 500 to 600 jin, with high yields reaching more than 800 jin.

Shortcomings and Errors in the Promotion Work

Why did "Aomori No. 5" experience yield reductions, and is it suitable for promotion in the South? According to my understanding, many agricultural scientists and comrades who participated in the actual work are conducting extensive discussions and continuing to experiment and research, which need to be proven by future practice. Regarding the shortcomings and errors in the promotion work, I believe that: First, the relevant agricultural leadership departments did not adhere to the principle of "experiment first, then promote," and overestimated the role of japonica rice in ensuring the completion of the grain production increase plan. Although japonica rice can be grown in the South, and the introduction of northern japonica to the South has been successful, for "Aomori No. 5," only relying on the several years (1951-1955) of experimental results from the Central China Agricultural Science Research Institute, without conducting multi-point trial demonstrations, large-scale allocation, and large-area promotion, was obviously too hasty. Second, due to the large-scale promotion without trial planting, there was a lack of experience in the characteristics of the new variety, the changes in its growth situation after being introduced to the South, and the appropriate cultivation techniques. Increased yields were achieved with proper planting methods, while reduced yields were achieved with improper methods. The fact that good and bad growth occurred in the same county, the same township, or even the same agricultural cooperative proves this point. In Thirteen Temples Township, Xishui County, Hubei Province, 15 mu of "Aomori No. 5" achieved an average yield of 531 jin per mu; while in the nearby Hedong Township, the average yield per mu was only 194 jin. In Qichun County's New Life Cooperative, one field of "Aomori No. 5" achieved an average yield of 726 jin per mu; while another field only yielded an average of 74 jin per mu.

How to Treat Shortcomings and Errors

No one should object to giving appropriate criticism to those who have done things badly or have made mistakes, because this criticism can help those who have made mistakes and educate more people to recognize the nature and causes of the mistakes, so as to learn lessons and do their work better. People live and work all their lives, and they often achieve results and make mistakes. Mistakes cannot be tolerated with an attitude of forgiveness, let alone concealment. At the same time, we should also strive to avoid excessive criticism and accusations. If the current situation is still like what the People's Daily editorial pointed out on October 12 last year, "This spring, rural workers in many areas, after criticizing right-leaning conservative thinking on cooperativization, have generally developed a sense of impatience," if many rural workers are still blindly promoting certain technical measures without regard to objective realities, then it is necessary to give timely criticism and education to prevent the development of errors. However, according to my understanding, this is no longer the case in rural areas in many regions. Instead, certain negative emotions have arisen due to some shortcomings in the past promotion of production increase measures, and they are hesitant to implement production increase measures. In this case, if we continue to criticize impatience and rash advances, I am afraid it will not be of much benefit to the work. Perhaps it would be appropriate to take more measures to encourage the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses. Therefore, I believe that the policy of "affirming achievements, criticizing shortcomings, and protecting the enthusiasm of cadres" is very correct and necessary.

The losses suffered due to the failure of the promotion of "Aomori No. 5" could, of course, be avoided or greatly reduced if the work was done well. However, as Comrade Zhiyan pointed out, "Due to the vast territory of our country, complex terrain and climate, and the lack of agricultural technicians and their low level, and there are many problems that have not been solved in agricultural science." I think it should also be added that the level of rural work and agricultural work leadership cadres is not high enough, and there is still subjectivism and bureaucratism. Therefore, it is understandable and difficult to avoid suffering some failures in the promotion of agricultural production increase measures (including the promotion of "Aomori No. 5").

As for what attitude the agricultural leadership departments should take towards the problems that occurred in the promotion of agricultural production increase measures last year (including the promotion of Aomori No. 5), and what responsibilities they should bear, this should of course be answered by the agricultural leadership departments. However, judging from the materials that I have seen that have already been published, the agricultural departments attach importance to these issues. Minister Liao Luyan gave a comprehensive summary in the summary of agricultural production work in 1956 and the tasks for 1957 (see Chinese Agriculture News, Issue 5, 1957). The Ministry of Agriculture held a rice system reform experience exchange meeting in February this year (see People's Daily, February 27, 1957), which discussed the Aomori No. 5 issue. At the same time, the China Agriculture News, published by the Agricultural Magazine under the leadership of the Ministry of Agriculture, also launched a discussion on the introduction of Aomori No. 5 in Hunan and Hubei (see China Agriculture News, Issues 21, 22, 23, 24, and 1, 4, and 6 of 1956 and 1957). Similar articles were also published in newspapers in Hunan and Hubei. These materials are available for Comrade Zhiyan to refer to.

专栏：

    对直言同志意见的意见
    读了4月14日人民日报直言同志的“怎样看待‘青森五号’事件呢？”一文，我认为很有教益，应该以诚恳认真的态度讨论一下。我在3月19日人民日报上发表的文章“吸取去年的经验更好地推广农业增产措施”，是就整个农业增产措施推广中的问题说的。对去年推广增产措施中发生的一些缺点和错误的估计，也是从整个工作的成绩来衡量的。“青森五号”早粳稻的推广，只是当作一个例子举出来，并无意如直言同志所说的掩饰错误。既然直言同志认为全篇文章是正确的，只是对“青森五号”的说法有原则上的不同意见，这里我就再谈一谈对“青森五号”早粳推广工作的看法。
    推广“青森五号”是水稻耕作制度改革工作中的一项失败
    1956年改革水稻耕作制度是有成效的，单季稻改双季稻的面积比1955年增加了三千二百多万亩，间作稻改连作稻的面积比1955年增加了七百零九万多亩，籼稻改粳稻的面积增加了一千一百多万亩。这三项改革的总面积，超过1953—1955年三年累计面积的三倍以上，估计增产粮食在五十亿斤左右。推广“青森五号”的失败，是在水稻耕作制度改革基本成功中的一个项目的失败。
      “青森五号”早粳去年主要是在湖南、湖北推广。湖南推广了二十五万五千三百一十亩（1956年10月12日“人民日报”所载的二十一万五千九百多亩，是未包括国营农场种植的数字在内）；湖北推广了五十多万亩。两省的情况大致都是每亩较早籼减产一百斤左右。部分地区也有大面积增产的。湖北省孝感县共种“青森五号”早粳一万八千六百七十五亩，约占全县早稻面积十八万一千三百六十二亩的10.3％，平均每亩产量五百七十斤，比本地早籼每亩平均产量五百一十四斤增产10.88％，并且出现了较大面积的高额丰产（该县东山乡的一千四百五十二点二亩“青森五号”早粳，每亩平均产量达七百零三斤，比本地早籼每亩平均产量的五百八十斤，增产21.2％）；鄂城县有小面积亩产千斤以上的。湖南省的汉寿县新桥咀农业社种的十九点六亩“青森五号”，每亩平均产量也达到六百二十四斤。
    粳稻向南方推广是有根据的
    “青森五号”向南方推广，是有一定根据的。南方种植粳稻已有很悠久的历史。太湖地区早有很大面积的粳稻区；湖南黔阳也有相当大面积的粳稻；海南岛的黎族兄弟，大部种的是粳稻；广西的百色专区也有粳稻数十万亩，每亩产量可达八、九百斤；云南在海拔一千五百公尺以上的地区大多种植粳稻；四川、贵州、湖北、江西、福建等省也有不少地区种植粳稻。日本帝国主义侵占台湾后，在1900年即开始把粳稻“蓬莱稻”向台湾引种，获得了成功。台湾在日本帝国主义统治时期，粳稻占水稻总面积的60％以上。
    近年来，北方种植的粳稻在南方推广，基本上是成功的。粳稻在肥料充足、精耕细作的条件下产量较高；粳稻品质一般比籼稻要好；粳稻比较耐寒，不易烂秧；粳稻耐旱、早熟，便于单季稻改双季稻。1956年籼稻改种粳稻的面积增加了一千一百多万亩，在绝大部分地区（江苏、浙江、江西、四川等省）的绝大部分面积上都提高了产量。
    问题较多的是在湖南湖北。据湖北省材料，推广早、中粳减产的多，增产的少；但产量极不平衡，高的每亩产量达到一千斤左右，低的有一、二百斤甚至几十斤的；推广一季晚粳和双季晚粳则普遍增产，产量也比较平衡。全省种早粳五十万亩，平均亩产三百一十四斤，比当年早籼稻平均亩产四百一十六斤减产24.5％，比1955年早籼稻平均亩产三百九十斤也减产20％。中粳一百五十万亩，平均亩产四百五十五斤，比当年中籼稻平均亩产四百八十二斤减产5.6％，比1955年中籼稻平均亩产四百二十六斤，增产6.8％。一季晚稻九十万亩，平均亩产六百五十斤，比当年中籼稻增产34.8％，比1955年中籼稻增产52.5％。双季晚粳五十万亩，平均亩产三百八十五斤，比当年晚籼稻平均亩产三百斤增产28.3％。总计起来，由于推广粳稻，全省增产约一亿多斤稻谷。
    湖南早粳“青森五号”大部减产，少数增产。全省平均每亩比早籼减产一百多斤。早粳三号、四号、十六号则普遍增产；每亩产量平均达五、六百斤。中粳每亩产量平均为三百斤左右，比全省中稻平均产量三百六十八斤减产两成多。晚粳一般增产，据常德专区、大通湖和西洞庭农场及部分县五万多亩晚粳统计，一季晚粳每亩平均产量达五、六百斤，高的有八百多斤的。
    推广工作中的缺点和错误
    “青森五号”为什么减产，是否适宜在南方推广？据我了解，许多农业科学家和参加了实际工作的同志们正在进行广泛的讨论，并且在继续试验研究，有待今后实践证明。就推广工作中的缺点和错误来说，我认为：第一、的确是有关的农业领导部门没有坚持先试验后推广的方针，过高地估计了推广粳稻对保证完成粮食增产计划的作用。虽然南方能种粳稻，北粳南引也是成功的，但是，对于“青森五号”，只凭华中农业科学研究所的几年（1951—1955）试验成果，没有进行多点试种示范，就大量调运，大面积推广，显然是冒进了些。第二、由于未经试种就大面积推广，对新品种的特性、引种到南方后生育情况的变化，以及适宜的栽培技术等都缺乏经验，种植得法的就增产了，不得法的就减产了。在同一县、同一乡甚至同一农业社内生长的有好有坏，就可以证明这一点。湖北省浠水县十三庙乡有十五亩“青森五号”，平均亩产五百三十一斤；而附近的河东乡每亩平均产量只有一百九十四斤。蕲春县新生活社一丘“青森五号”，平均亩产七百二十六斤；而另一丘则平均每亩只收七十四斤。
      怎样对待缺点和错误
    对于做坏了的事情和犯有错误的人，给予适当的批评是任何人也不应该反对的，因为这种批评能够帮助犯错误的人，并教育更多的人认清错误的性质、原因，以便接受教训，把工作做得更好。人生活一辈子，做一辈子工作，经常有成绩，也犯错误，犯了错误是不容许抱原谅态度，更不容许掩盖的。同时，也应该力求避免过多的批评指责。如果目前的情况，仍像去年10月12日人民日报社论所指出的，
  “今年春季不少地区的农村工作人员，在批判了对合作化的右倾保守思想之后，较为普遍地又产生了一种急躁情绪”，如果许多农村工作人员，还在不顾客观实际条件，盲目地硬行推广某些技术措施，那末，及时给以批评教育，制止错误的发展，是十分必要的。但是，据我了解，目前在许多地区的农村中已不是这种情况，而是由于过去在推广增产措施中有些缺点，产生了某些消极情绪，对贯彻增产措施缩手缩脚。在这种情况下，倘若继续批评急躁冒进，恐怕对工作没有多少好处吧？如果采取更多的鼓励干部、群众积极性的办法，也许是适宜的。因此，我认为“肯定成绩，批评缺点，保护干部积极性”的方针是十分正确和必要的。
    由于推广“青森五号”失败所遭受的损失，如果工作做得好，当然是可以避免或者大大减轻的。但是，正如直言同志所指出的，“由于我国幅员广大，地形气候复杂，农业技术干部既缺乏而水平又不高，并且有许多问题在农业科学上还没有解决”。我认为还应该加上农村工作和农业工作领导干部水平也还不够高，还存在着主观主义和官僚主义。因之，在农业增产措施的推广中，遭受一点失败（也包括推广“青森五号”在内），是可以理解的，也是难以避免的。
    至于对去年推行农业增产措施所发生的毛病（包括推广青森五号），农业领导部门应持什么态度，应负何种责任，这当然应该由农业领导部门答复。不过，从我所看到的已经发表过的材料看来，农业部门对这些问题还是重视的。廖鲁言部长在1956年农业生产工作的总结和1957年的任务中（见中国农报1957年5期），已经有了全面的总结。今年2月份农业部召开的水稻改制经验交流会（见1957年2月27日人民日报），对青森五号问题进行了讨论。同时，在农业部领导的农业杂志社出版的中国农报上，也展开了关于湖南、湖北引进青森五号的讨论（见中国农报1956年第二十一、二十二、二十三、二十四及1957年一、四、六各期）。在湖南、湖北的报纸上也发表了类似的文章。这些材料都可供直言同志参考。
