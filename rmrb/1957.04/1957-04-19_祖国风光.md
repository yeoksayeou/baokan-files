    Scenery of the Motherland
    Huangshan Mountain, located in southern Anhui Province, spans the three counties of Shexian, Xiuning, and Taiping, covering an area of over 300 li. It has thirty-six major peaks and seventy-two minor peaks, with peaks and ridges that are uniquely beautiful; it has eight rocks, twelve caves, and twenty-four streams; it has five seas and four corners; it has hot springs, waterfalls, ancient pines, and strange rocks, with countless scenic spots. This is a corner of the Celestial Capital Peak standing in the sea of clouds.

    祖国风光
    黄山，位于安徽南部，地跨歙县、休宁、太平三县，盘区三百余里。有三十六大峰，七十二小峰，峰峦挺秀，石石标新；有八岩、十二洞、二十四溪；有五海、四隅；有温泉、飞瀑、古松怪石，胜迹不可枚举。这是耸立在云海里的天都峰一角。
