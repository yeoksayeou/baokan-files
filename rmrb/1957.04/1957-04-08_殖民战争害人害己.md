    Colonial Wars Harm Others and Oneself
    The dirty colonial war waged by the French government in Algeria has reached such an absurd point: on the land of Algeria, with a population of less than ten million, the French colonialists have thrown in 600,000 invading troops. The money France spent on the Algerian battlefield reached 485 billion francs in 1956, the highest record in history. This staggering figure accounts for about 11% of France's total budget expenditure and about 52% of France's military budget.
    The French government, serving monopoly capital, generously spends taxpayers' money on colonial wars, but is extremely indifferent to social welfare and people's lives. In 1956, the total amount allocated to the economic and social development fund was only 200 billion francs, less than one-twentieth of the total budget expenditure, and less than half of the money spent on the Algerian battlefield in 1956. As everyone knows, France's housing shortage is very serious. One-third of the houses in the country have exceeded their useful life. At present, about seven million people in France do not even have dilapidated houses to live in. In Paris alone, one million people have no housing or live in dilapidated houses. However, if the military expenditure spent in Algeria last year was used to build houses, 161,500 houses could be built.
    The funding for French schools is very short, the school buildings are old and crowded, and the students' learning conditions are very poor. The building of the Faculty of Arts of the University of Paris, built in 1890 and only intended to accommodate about 1,000 students, has not been expanded for more than 60 years until 1956, but now it has to accommodate 19,000 students, which is more than 17 times that of 1890. In the university's classrooms with only 700 seats, 2,480 students have to attend classes. As a result, many students have to sit on the steps or stand, and many students cannot attend classes at all, so they have to borrow notes from classmates or study by themselves. There are only 50 seats in the studios for 182 professors and lecturers. The library shared by the Faculty of Arts and the Faculty of Sciences has only 422 seats, but it has to serve 34,000 students. However, if the military expenditure for the invasion of Algeria last year was used to run education, 60,000 schools could be built.

    殖民战争害人害己
    法国政府在阿尔及利亚进行的肮脏的殖民战争，已到了这样荒唐的地步：在不到一千万人口的阿尔及利亚的土地上，法国殖民主义者竟投下了六十万侵略军队。法国在阿尔及利亚战场上花的钱，在1956年达到四千八百五十亿法郎，为历年来最高的纪录。这个惊人的数字，占法国预算总支出约11％，占法国军事预算约52％。
    为垄断资本效劳的法国政府把纳税人的钱慷慨地耗费在殖民战争上，但对于社会福利事业和人民生活却十分漠视。1956年拨作经济与社会发展基金总数仅有二千亿法郎。还不到预算总支出的二十分之一。比1956年在阿尔及利亚战场上消耗的钱一半还不到。大家知道，法国的房荒是十分严重的。全国有三分之一的房屋已经超过了使用年限。目前法国约有七百万人连破房子也没有住。仅巴黎就有一百万人无房可住，或住在摇摇欲坠的破旧房屋中。但是，如果把去年花在阿尔及利亚的军费用来建筑房屋，就可建成十六万一千五百套住宅。
    法国各学校的经费很短绌，校舍陈旧拥挤，学生的学习条件很差。在1890年建设的只准备容纳一千来个学生的巴黎大学文学院的校舍，到1956年为止的六十多年间一直没有扩充，现在却要容纳一万九千名学生，等于1890年时的十七倍多。在这所大学的仅有七百个座位的课堂里，却要供二千四百八十个学生上课，结果许多学生只好坐在阶梯上或者站着，许多学生根本不能听课，只好向同学借抄笔记或自修。供一百八十二名教授和讲师使用的工作室只有五十个位置。文学院和科学院合用的图书馆只有四百二十二个座位，却要供三万四千名学生使用。但是，如果把去年侵略阿尔及利亚的军费用来办教育，就可以建成六万所学校。
