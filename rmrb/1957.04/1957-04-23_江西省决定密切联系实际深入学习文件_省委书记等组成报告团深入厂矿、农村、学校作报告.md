This newspaper is reporting from Nanchang on the 22nd of April. For a month, Jiangxi Province has been widely conveying Chairman Mao's speech on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, from within the Party to outside the Party, and from the province to the county, and has conducted forums and discussions.

Through preliminary study and discussion, many problems have been resolved, but many ideological problems still need further resolution. For example, there is recognition that the Party's policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend" is firm. However, there are still many disagreements on how to understand and treat "letting" and "contending." Some people believe that the "hundred flowers" that bloom should include both socialist "flowers" and capitalist "flowers"; others believe that "letting" is for the sake of socialist flowers blooming, and capitalist "flowers" should not be let; and still others believe that both fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds should be allowed to bloom, ultimately achieving the prosperity of literature and art. For example, there is recognition that contradictions among the people are the main contradictions at present, but there are various different views on whether there are still antagonistic contradictions within the country. In short, many issues need to be discussed further in depth in order to gain a correct understanding.

The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened an enlarged meeting of its Standing Committee on April 18, deciding to organize cadres on a large scale throughout the province to study Chairman Mao's speech, and at the same time, to widely educate workers, peasants, and students.

The meeting believes that Chairman Mao's speech has not only great theoretical significance but also great practical significance. Correctly handling contradictions among the people can further fully promote the enthusiasm of the people for socialist construction. The meeting believes that with regard to the contradictions existing among the people, it is necessary to oppose both the bureaucratic attitude of turning a blind eye and failing to deal with them seriously, and to prevent exaggerating the contradictions; it is necessary to understand the fundamental unity of interests among the people, and as long as we proceed from unity and go through criticism and education, we can achieve unity on a new basis.

Correctly handling contradictions among the people is a new issue for all cadres. In the past, many cadres engaged in class struggle for a long time and were familiar with the methods of class struggle, but they lacked experience in handling contradictions among the people. At the same time, it is necessary to further improve the understanding of the nature of contradictions among the people and the correct methods of solving them, even in the minds of relatively senior leading cadres. Therefore, the meeting believes that it is very necessary to continue to carry out this study in depth among all cadres, especially among leading cadres at all levels. In the study, free discussion should be carried out, and after a certain improvement in ideological understanding through studying documents, work should be examined, the implementation of policies should be examined, ideological style should be examined, and criticism and self-criticism should be carried out correctly. In the study, it is also necessary to conscientiously solve the main problems existing in various practical tasks, and the experience of handling contradictions among the people that have already been dealt with should also be summarized, in order to achieve the purpose of improving ideological understanding, closely linking with the masses, and improving leadership. The study time is two months, and the learning methods are determined by all parties based on specific circumstances.

In order to educate workers, peasants, students, and grassroots cadres, the meeting decided to establish a report group, composed of the provincial Party secretary, members of the provincial Standing Committee, heads and deputy heads of various departments, and heads of various units, to go to factories, mines, rural areas, and schools to give reports.

    江西省决定密切联系实际深入学习文件
    省委书记等组成报告团深入厂矿、农村、学校作报告
    本报南昌22日电　一个月来，江西省从党内到党外、从省到县广泛传达了毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的讲话，并且进行了座谈和讨论。
    通过初步的学习和讨论解决了很多问题，但仍有很多思想问题需要进一步解决。如认识到党对“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针是坚决的。但怎样理解和对待“放”和“鸣”还有很多分歧。有人认为百花齐放是社会主义的“百花”和资本主义的“百花”齐放；有人却认为
  “放”是为了社会主义的百花齐放，不能放资本主义之“花”；有些人则认为：香花和毒花都放，最后达到文学艺术的繁荣。又如认识到人民内部矛盾是当前的主要矛盾，但对国内是否还存在对抗性的矛盾，则有各种不同的看法。总之，许多问题需要进一步深入讨论，才能得到正确的认识。
    中共江西省委在4月18日召开常委扩大会议，决定在全省范围内大规模地组织干部学习毛主席的讲话，同时广泛地向工人、农民和学生进行教育。
    会议认为毛主席的讲话不仅有伟大的理论意义，并且有巨大的现实意义。正确处理人民内部矛盾，可以进一步充分发扬人民群众的社会主义建设的积极性。会议认为对人民内部存在的矛盾，既要反对熟视无睹不认真处理的官僚主义态度，又要防止夸大矛盾的一面；要懂得人民内部根本利益的一致，只要从团结出发，经过批评教育，就可以取得在新的基础上的团结。
    正确处理人民内部矛盾对所有干部来说都是新问题。很多干部过去长时期进行阶级斗争，熟悉阶级斗争的方法，对处理人民内部矛盾则缺少经验。同时，对人民内部矛盾的性质，正确的解决方法等等，就是在比较高级的领导干部的思想上也有进一步提高的必要。因此会议认为在全体干部中，特别是在各级领导干部中继续深入地开展这一学习是非常必要的。在学习中应该开展自由讨论，通过钻研文件，在思想认识有一定提高以后，检查工作，检查政策的执行，检查思想作风，正确地开展批评和自我批评。在学习中，还要认真解决各项实际工作中存在的主要问题，对已经处理的人民内部矛盾的经验也应该加以总结，以求达到提高思想认识、密切联系群众、改进领导的目的。学习时间为两个月，学习的方式由各方面根据具体情况确定。
    为向工人、农民、学生和基层干部进行教育，会议决定成立报告团，以省委书记、省常委、各部正副部长和各单位负责人组成，分头深入厂矿、农村、学校作报告。
