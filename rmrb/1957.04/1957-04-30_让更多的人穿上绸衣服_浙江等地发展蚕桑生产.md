    Zhejiang Spring Silkworms About to Appear
    (This newspaper dispatch) Zhejiang province's broad masses of silkworm farmers are actively engaged in spring silkworm production. The first batch of 700 silkworm egg sheets was released from storage in Hangzhou on March 24th, and it is expected that spring silkworms will appear in early May.
    Recently, the weather has been warm, and mulberry leaves in southern Zhejiang have grown to about ten centimeters in length; in the famous Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou silkworm areas, all mulberry trees have been unfolded, with the largest leaves reaching three centimeters in length.
    This year, Zhejiang Province plans to distribute 818,000 spring silkworm egg sheets. Based on last year's spring cocoon yield per unit, it is estimated that approximately 450,000 dan of spring cocoons can be produced.

    Sichuan Mulberry Seeds Transferred to Guizhou
    (This newspaper dispatch) The Mianyang Prefectural Commissioner's Office in Sichuan recently transferred 2,090 jin of mulberry seeds to support the development of sericulture as a sideline production in the rural areas of Zhengan, Tongzi, Yanhe, and Daozhen counties in Guizhou Province. These mulberry seeds are high-quality Jing mulberry varieties collected last summer in the mountainous areas of Jiange, Zhaohua, Qingchuan, and Guangyuan counties. They are drought-resistant, early-maturing, and have high leaf yields, making them very suitable for planting in high-altitude areas.

    Jiangsu Silkworm Eggs Shipped to Fujian
    (This newspaper dispatch) As the weather warms up and mulberry trees sprout quickly, it is time to prepare for the supply of silkworm eggs. The Jiangsu Provincial Silkworm Seed Company has begun releasing more than 400,000 spring silkworm egg sheets from cold storage for shipment to Fujian, Henan, and other provinces. In addition, thirteen excellent varieties that have been cold stored will be distributed to farmers in Hebei, Henan, Anhui, and other places in the province for trial rearing.
