Xinhua News Agency, April 19th dispatch from Damascus: Syrian Prime Minister al-Asali said on the 18th: "Only Israel and its Western allies would think of aggression against Jordan."

He said: "Arab countries, allied with Jordan by a defense agreement, will do their utmost to defend Jordan's independence."

Al-Asali was speaking in response to US President Eisenhower's remarks at a press conference on the 17th. The US President stated that the United States would intervene in any attack on Jordan in accordance with the 1950 Tripartite Declaration (US, UK, and France) and the US Congressional Middle East Resolution.

Al-Asali said that Arab countries are prepared to "stop any Israeli aggression and give Israel a double blow in return."

Xinhua News Agency, April 18th dispatch from Paris: "Le Nouvel Observateur" magazine journalist Martina, who recently traveled to Israel, wrote that weapons drawn from French combat reserves are simply stored in various bases in Israel, just as they might be stored in Bizerte, Colomb-Béchar, or Dakar in North Africa. Therefore, France could be back on Israel's side to intervene in just a few days.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, April 19th: According to a Middle East News Agency report from Jerusalem, the Jordanian National Guidance Committee in Jerusalem has demanded the immediate replacement of the current US Ambassador to Jordan.

In a telegram to the new Jordanian Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, and Defense Minister, the committee said that this is necessary for the security of Jordan and to keep its sovereignty and independence free from conspiracies and imperialist interference. The current US Ambassador to Jordan is Lester Mallory.

The committee also demanded that the new government immediately issue a statement reaffirming to the people their freedoms and take effective and urgent steps to restore normalcy in the army to the situation before the recent crisis, so that every officer can return to their original position.

The National Guidance Committee is a political organization with the participation of many political parties established after the recent political crisis in Jordan.

    叙利亚总理警告西方和以色列
    阿拉伯国家将尽力保卫约旦
    约旦全国指导委员会要求调换美国大使
    新华社19日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚总理阿萨利18日说：“只有以色列和它的西方盟国才想到对约旦进行侵略。”
    他说：“以防御协定同约旦结成了联盟的阿拉伯国家将尽力保卫约旦的独立。”
    阿萨利是针对美国总统艾森豪威尔17日在记者招待会上的谈话而这样说的。美国总统表示，美国将根据1950年美、英、法三国宣言和美国国会的中东决议，干预对约旦的任何攻击。
    阿萨利说，阿拉伯国家准备“制止以色列的任何侵略，并且给予以色列加倍的回击”。
    据新华社18日讯　巴黎消息：最近曾前往以色列旅行的“法兰西观察家”杂志的记者马蒂纳写道，从法国作战储备中抽出的武器干脆就储藏在以色列各个基地上，就像可能储藏在北非的比塞大、科隆培沙或达喀尔一样。因此只要几天的时间，法国就可以重新站在以色列一边来进行干涉。
    新华社开罗19日电　据中东通讯社耶路撒冷消息，在耶路撒冷的约旦全国指导委员会已经要求立即调换目前美国驻约旦的大使。
    委员会在给约旦新政府的首相、外交大臣和国防大臣的电报里说，为了约旦的安全，并且为了保持它的主权和独立不受阴谋和帝国主义干涉的侵害，这是必要的。目前美国驻约旦的大使是莱斯特·马洛里。
    委员会还要求新政府立即发表声明，重新向人民保证他们的自由，并且采取有效的和紧急的步骤来恢复最近的危机以前军队中的正常情况，以便每个军官能够恢复他们原来的职务。
    全国指导委员会是一个政治组织，参加的有许多在约旦最近发生政治危机以后建立起来的政党。
