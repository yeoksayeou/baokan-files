    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 11th: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic issued a statement on the 10th, condemning the colonialist tendencies of the West German government.
    The statement said: It has become increasingly clear recently that the West German government is supporting the exploitation of colonies and the suppression of the movements of colonial peoples striving for freedom by countries such as Britain, France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, and that West Germany itself has already appeared as a colonial country.
    The statement pointed out that West German monopoly capital groups are doing their utmost to try to invade economically underdeveloped countries, and they are trying to seize oil exploitation rights in Middle Eastern countries. West Germany supported the Anglo-French-Israeli aggression against Egypt and endorsed the "Eisenhower Doctrine," which aims to economically and militarily enslave Asian and African countries. The West German government agreed to include the territory of West Irian, Indonesia, within the "Common Market" (as a "overseas territory" of the Netherlands). On the issue of the return of Goa to India, the West German government also sided with the Portuguese colonizers.
    The statement said: All this shows that the West German government has become an active supporter of colonialism. The government of the German Democratic Republic solemnly condemns the West German government's attempts at colonial expansion, and welcomes the liberation movements of the Asian and African peoples. All its sympathy and support are on the side of the Asian and African peoples.

    民主德国表示同情亚非人民
    谴责西德政府殖民主义倾向
    据新华社柏林11日电　德意志民主共和国外交部10日发表声明，谴责西德政府的殖民主义倾向。
    声明说：最近期间越来越明显地表明，西德政府正在支持英国、法国、比利时、荷兰等国对它们的殖民地的剥削和对殖民地人民争取自由的运动的镇压，而且西德自己也已经以殖民国家的姿态出现。
    声明指出，西德垄断资本集团正在尽最大力量企图侵入经济不发达的国家，它们力图攫取在中东各国的石油开采权。西德支持英法以侵埃战争和赞同目的在于在经济上和军事上奴役亚非国家的“艾森豪威尔主义”。西德政府同意把印度尼西亚的领土西伊里安包括在“共同市场”范围内（作为荷兰的“海外属地”）。在果阿归还给印度的问题上，西德政府也站在葡萄牙殖民者那一方面。
    声明说：这一切表明，西德政府已经成为殖民主义的积极支持者。德意志民主共和国政府严正谴责西德政府的殖民扩张企图，而欢迎亚非人民的解放运动。它的全部的同情和支持是在亚非人民这一边。
