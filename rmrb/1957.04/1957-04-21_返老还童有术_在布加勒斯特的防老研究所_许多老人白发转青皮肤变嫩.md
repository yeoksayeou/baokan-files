Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest Dispatch, Reporter Ding Man reports: In Romania, medical scientists have found a way to rejuvenate people. Their "magic" has turned the white hair of many elderly people black, and has caused new hair to grow on the bald heads of many more.

The reporter recently visited the Bucharest Anti-Aging Institute with the Chinese Health Work Delegation. According to the director of the institute, this is the only institute of its kind in the world.

The institute is inhabited by elderly people, some in their seventies, nineties, and even one hundred and elevens. But they do not give people a sense of being old and senile. The "old men" that people see are full of energy and as strong as middle-aged people.

It is said that these people originally had silver or completely bald hair, failing limbs, dull eyes, declining memory, and had lost their ability to work. But now, the most obvious signs of rejuvenation have appeared in these old people: white hair has turned into black hair, new hair has grown on bald heads, metabolism has increased, memory has been restored, skin has become tender, pulse is active, and eyes are piercing. After two or three years of "anti-aging" treatment, the elderly can not only take care of themselves in life, but also engage in several hours of other labor every day. The person in charge of the Proşti branch of the institute also said that the workers who originally received pensions there had become strong and powerful after "anti-aging" treatment, and as a result, they resumed work.

Professor Aslan, the director of the Anti-Aging Institute, introduced their anti-aging experience to the Chinese guests. She said that their main method of anti-aging is to inject novocaine, which can prevent arteriosclerosis and is nutritious for the nerves. Chinese medical experts believe that their good living environment is also very important for becoming younger.

The institute officially started its work in 1951. At the beginning of the experiment, the medical scientists only intended to cure the rheumatism of the elderly, but the result was not only the cure of the disease, but also the rejuvenation of the people. At this time, their attention shifted to the question of how to prevent aging. Now, they are not only studying how to make the elderly younger, but also how to prolong the youth of young people. According to their experiments with white mice, novocaine can extend the lifespan of white mice from 1,100 days to 1,600 days.

Professor Aslan said that their experience proves that due to the different specific conditions of each person, the amount and time of novocaine injection are different. They generally inject one cc under the skin first to see how the reaction is. If there is no reaction, then they continue to inject two cc intramuscularly. The normal injection is five cc each time. Generally, they inject for one week and rest for one week. In each injection week, some inject once every other day, and some inject once every two days. After the injection, about one in a thousand people has a reaction.

In addition to the branch in Proşti, the institute has also established branches in Iaşi and Stalin City. Now, those who come to the institute for anti-aging treatment are not only Romanians, but also elderly people from the Soviet Union, Poland, Finland and other countries.

### 返老还童有术  在布加勒斯特的防老研究所  许多老人白发转青皮肤变嫩

    返老还童有术
    在布加勒斯特的防老研究所  许多老人白发转青皮肤变嫩
    新华社布加勒斯特电　记者丁曼报道：在罗马尼亚，医学家们已经为人们找到了使人返老还童的方法，他们的“魔力”已经使好多老人的白发转青，使许多老人光秃的头上又长出了新的头发。
    记者最近随中国卫生工作代表团参观了布加勒斯特防老研究所，据研究所所长介绍，这是目前世界上唯一的一个这类的研究所。
    研究所居住着的都是些老人，其中有七十、九十甚至一百一十岁的。可是他们给予人们的不是那种暮气沉沉的感觉，人们看到的“老头”一个个精神奕奕，像中年人那样的健壮。
    据说这些人原来也是头发已经银白或脱光，手脚失灵，眼神迟呆，记忆力衰退和失掉了劳动力。可是现在这些老人们身上却出现了最明显的返老还童的征象：白头发变成了黑发，秃头上长出了新发，新陈代谢增进，记忆力恢复，皮肤变嫩，脉搏活跃，眼睛炯炯有神。只要经过两三年的“防老”，老人们不但能在生活上自己照顾自己，而且每天还要从事几个小时的其他劳动。这个研究所在普罗什蒂分所的负责人还说，他们那里原来领取养老金的工人经过“防老”治理，身体变得健壮有力，结果又恢复了工作。
    防老研究所所长阿斯兰教授向中国的客人们介绍了他们的防老经验。她说，他们防老的主要方法是注射奴佛卡因，这种针可以防止动脉血管硬化，对神经富有营养。中国的医学专家认为，他们的良好生活环境对变年轻也很有关系。
    这个研究所工作是从1951年正式开始的。开始试验时，医学家们只打算把老年人的风湿病医治好，但结果不仅治好了疾病，连人也变年轻了。这时候他们的注意力又转移到如何防老的问题。现在他们不仅在研究使老人变年轻，而且还在研究如何使年轻人延长青春的问题。经他们用小白鼠试验的结果，奴佛卡因可以使小白鼠的寿命从一千一百天延长到一千六百天。
    阿斯兰教授说，他们的经验证明，由于每个人的具体条件不同，所以注射奴佛卡因的量和时间是不一样的。他们一般地是先在人的皮下注射一西西，看看反应如何？如果没有反应，就继续肌肉注射二西西。正常的注射每次是五西西。一般是注射一周休息一周，每一注射周，有的隔一天注射一次，有的隔两天一次。注射以后，大约有千分之一的人是有反应的。
    这个研究所除了在普罗什蒂设有分所外，还在雅西、斯大林城建立了分所。现在到研究所要求防老的，不但有罗马尼亚人，而且还有苏联、波兰、芬兰等国家的老人。
