    Resolutely Eliminate Schistosomiasis
    State Council Issues Instructions

    The elimination of schistosomiasis is a serious political task at present.

    The instructions begin by stating: Schistosomiasis has been prevalent in our country for a long time, and its harm to the people is extremely serious. The disease is prevalent in 350 counties (cities) in twelve provinces (municipalities), including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, and Shanghai. The number of people suffering from the disease is about ten million, and the population threatened by infection is over one hundred million. Schistosomiasis has become the most harmful of the existing endemic diseases in our country. It seriously affects agricultural production in the disease-prevalent areas. If it is allowed to continue to spread, it will endanger the health and prosperity of our nation. Therefore, the elimination of schistosomiasis has become a serious political task for us at present. It is necessary to fully mobilize the broad masses in the schistosomiasis-prevalent areas and resolutely fight to eliminate this disease.

    Great achievements and new experiences have been made in prevention and control work.

    The instructions then analyze that the Chinese people have a long history of fighting schistosomiasis. Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the "National Agricultural Development Program (Draft) from 1956 to 1967" and the basic completion of national agricultural cooperation, with the joint efforts of the Party, the government, and the people in schistosomiasis-prevalent areas, great achievements and new experiences have been made in prevention and control work in the past year: First, the leadership of the Party and the government over the prevention and control of schistosomiasis has been greatly strengthened. Party organizations at the county level and above in the schistosomiasis-prevalent areas, as well as most Party organizations at the township level and above, have established leading groups for the prevention and control of schistosomiasis. Prevention and control committees have been established in people's committees at all levels above the township level in most areas. Second, the masses have been mobilized, scientific and technological forces have been mobilized and organized, and a mass prevention and control movement has been launched. According to incomplete statistics, various provinces (cities) have carried out snail eradication work in more than 150 million square meters of snail-infested areas. More than 400,000 patients have been treated in one year, equivalent to 266% of the 150,000 patients treated in the seven years since liberation. Third, a series of effective experiences have been gained in organizational leadership, mass mobilization, and prevention and control technology. New methods of snail eradication have been created in lake and shoal areas by combining water conservancy construction, land reclamation, planting, winter plowing, and planting early-maturing crops. In general areas, the method of snail eradication by gas flame spraying has been created, and snail eradication drugs such as tea seed cake and crow poison have been discovered. In terms of treatment, after clinical trials, several traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions have been confirmed to be effective in treating early or late-stage patients. In Western medicine, the three-day antimony therapy has also been confirmed. In addition, the effect of atropine and acupuncture in reducing the reaction to antimony agents has also been confirmed. Many new experiences have been created in storing manure to kill eggs and in personal protection.

    Several tasks regarding the future prevention and control of schistosomiasis

    Regarding the future work of preventing and controlling schistosomiasis, the instructions put forward the following points: First, regarding the treatment of patients. A policy of active treatment must be adopted in order to cooperate with active prevention work and reduce the number of patients year by year. This is an important aspect of gradually achieving the complete elimination of schistosomiasis. The view of simply preventing and neglecting treatment is wrong. Both early-stage and late-stage patients must be treated concurrently. Symptomatic patients should be treated as soon as possible. It is wrong to treat only early-stage patients and neglect the treatment of symptomatic patients. In view of the fact that Western medicine and Western drugs, as well as traditional Chinese medicine and Chinese drugs, have their own advantages in treating early-stage and late-stage patients, Western and Chinese medicine should cooperate more closely in treatment. In the treatment work, it is necessary to closely rely on agricultural production cooperatives and arrange the treatment work in a planned way according to the specific conditions of the medical force. The people's committees of each province (city) should formulate a plan for treating patients year by year according to the specific conditions and conditions of the local area, actively organize forces, and resolutely complete it. Other various Western and Chinese medicines that have been confirmed to be effective should be carefully promoted according to the specific conditions of each region. The three-day antimony therapy, which has now been confirmed to be effective, should be actively promoted in a step-by-step manner wherever conditions permit. Second, regarding prevention work. For schistosomiasis, it is necessary to actively treat and actively prevent, from controlling infection to gradually reducing infection year by year, and at the same time cooperate with treatment to finally achieve the goal of eliminating schistosomiasis. Therefore, the view of simply treating and neglecting prevention is also wrong. For all preventive measures, whether it is eliminating snails, managing feces to accumulate fertilizer and kill eggs, protecting safe water use, and preventing personal infection, a comprehensive plan must be formulated, comprehensive measures must be taken, and it must be carried out in a planned and step-by-step manner. In the future, in prevention work, it is necessary to actively organize scientific and technological forces, conduct scientific research, summarize the experience of the masses, and constantly create new methods in practice, and strive to spend less money, save manpower, and achieve greater results. Third, fully mobilize the masses and combine with science and technology. The prevention and control of schistosomiasis is a serious struggle of millions of people against the disease. It is necessary to rely on the wisdom and efforts of the broad masses and also rely on the correct guidance of science and technology. The two must be closely combined in order to achieve the due effect. The most important link at present is to make the existing science and technology mastered by the masses and become a weapon to fight against schistosomiasis. The main problems that need to be solved by scientific and technological research work at present are: snail ecology, better snail and egg killing drugs, oral medicines or other new medicines, Chinese medicine prescriptions, etc. Fourth, prevention and control work must be combined with the development of agricultural production and water conservancy construction. The key to combining prevention and control work with the development of agricultural production is to rely on the unified arrangement of party and government leaders at all levels from the province (city) to the township, and to combine the various measures of prevention and control work with the various measures of development production as much as possible. Fifth, we must resolutely carry out repeated struggles and persist to the end. This requires us to be fully prepared ideologically and organizationally, resolutely carry out long-term repeated struggles, persist unremittingly, have a beginning and an end, and never give up halfway.

    Strengthen the leadership of the Party and the government over the prevention and control of schistosomiasis.

    The instructions finally put forward that strengthening the leadership of the Party and the government over the prevention and control of schistosomiasis is the basic guarantee for eliminating schistosomiasis, and stipulates that people's committees at all levels above the township level in epidemic areas, which have not yet established prevention and control committees, should be established quickly. In order to ensure that prevention and control work is not squeezed out by the current heavy tasks in rural areas, when planning rural work tasks for each period, the people's committees at all levels in epidemic areas should include the prevention and control of schistosomiasis in the production plan, put forward specific tasks, and arrange, inspect, and implement them uniformly with rural production. The agricultural, health, water conservancy and other relevant departments of the State Council and the people's committees at all levels in epidemic areas should also include the relevant prevention and control work in their own work plans and conscientiously organize and implement them according to the unified requirements of prevention and control work in each period and the business conditions of each department. The township people's committees with prevention and control tasks should, according to the specific conditions of production and prevention and control work in each period, lead the agricultural production cooperatives to uniformly arrange the specific tasks of production and prevention and control work, promptly resolve the specific contradictions in the arrangement of production and prevention and control work, and properly handle the work point issues in the treatment of patients. In areas with severe diseases, agricultural production cooperatives and production teams should have a deputy cadre to specifically lead prevention and control work. In ethnic minority areas where schistosomiasis is prevalent, when deploying and promoting prevention and control work, it is necessary to fully take into account their lifestyle, production habits, and religious customs characteristics, patiently carry out publicity and education, steadily carry out prevention and control work, and give them strong assistance and support in economy and technology.

    坚决消灭血吸虫病
    国务院发出指示
    新华社23日讯　国务院在20日发出关于消灭血吸虫病的指示。
    消灭血吸虫病是当前的一项严重政治任务
    指示首先说：血吸虫病在我国流行已久，对于人民的危害是极其严重的。病害流行地区遍及江苏、浙江、湖南、湖北、安徽、江西、四川、云南、广东、广西、福建和上海等十二个省（市）的三百五十个县（市），患病人数约有一千多万，受到感染威胁的人口则在一亿以上。血吸虫病已经成为我国现有流行病中危害最大的一种病害，它严重地影响着病害流行地区的农业生产，如果任其继续蔓延下去，势将危及我民族的健康和繁荣。因此，消灭血吸虫病已成为我们当前的一项严重的政治任务，必须充分地发动血吸虫病流行地区的广大群众，坚决地为消灭这一病害而斗争。
    防治工作取得了很大的成绩和新的经验
    指示接着分析，我国人民同血吸虫病作斗争是有悠久历史的。自从中共中央提出了“1956年到1967年全国农业发展纲要”（草案）和全国农业合作化基本完成以后，在党、政府和血吸虫病流行地区人民群众的共同努力下，近一年来的防治工作已经取得了很大的成绩和新的经验：第一、党和政府对血吸虫病防治工作的领导大大地加强了。中央和血吸虫病流行地区县以上党的组织以及大部分乡以上党的组织，都已经建立了防治血吸虫病领导小组。在大部分地区乡以上的各级人民委员会都建立了防治委员会。第二、发动了群众，动员和组织了科学技术力量，开展了群众性的防治运动。据不完全的统计，各省（市）已经在一亿五千多万平方公尺的钉螺地区进行了灭螺工作。一年中治疗病人在四十万以上，相当于解放七年来治疗十五万病人的266％。第三、在组织领导、发动群众和防治的技术上，取得了一系列的有效经验。在湖沼洲滩地区创造了结合兴修水利围垦种植、冬耕种植早熟作物灭螺的新方法。在一般地区创造了煤气火焰喷射灭螺的方法，发现了茶子饼、闹洋花等灭螺药物。在治疗上，经过临床试验，肯定了对治疗早期或晚期病人有疗效的若干中医药方。在西医方面，也肯定了锑剂三日疗法，此外，还肯定了阿托品和针灸对减低锑剂反应的效果。在贮粪灭卵和个人防护方面，都创造了许多新的经验。
    关于今后防治血吸虫病的几项工作
    关于防治血吸虫病今后的工作，指示提出下面几点：第一、关于治疗病人。必须采取积极治疗的方针，以求配合积极预防工作，使病人年年减少，这是逐步达到全部消灭血吸虫病的一个重要方面。单纯预防、忽视治疗的观点是错误的。对于早期病人和晚期病人必须兼治。有症状的病人，应当尽先治疗。只治早期病人，忽视有症状病人的治疗是不对的。鉴于目前西医西药和中医中药治疗早期病人和晚期病人，各有所长，在治疗上中西医更应该密切合作。在治疗工作中必须紧密地依靠农业生产合作社，按照医疗力量的具体条件，有计划地安排治疗工作。各省（市）人民委员会应当按照当地的具体情况和条件，订出逐年治疗病人的规划，积极组织力量，坚决加以完成。现有的其他各种确有疗效的西药和中药，应当按照各地的具体情况，慎重地加以推行。对现在已经肯定了疗效的锑剂三日疗法，凡是有条件的地方，都应当有步骤地积极加以推广。第二、关于预防工作。对于血吸虫病既要积极治疗，又要积极预防，由控制感染到逐年减少感染，同时配合治疗以便最后达到消灭血吸虫病的目的。因此单纯治疗、忽视预防的观点也是错误的。预防工作的各项措施，不论消灭钉螺、管理粪便积肥灭卵、保护用水安全和个人预防感染，都必须订出全面规划，采取综合措施，有计划、有步骤地进行。今后，在预防工作中，应当积极组织科学技术力量，进行科学研究，总结群众经验，在实践中不断地创造新的办法，力求花钱少、人力省、收效大。第三、充分发动群众和科学技术相结合。防治血吸虫病是千百万群众对病害的一场严重斗争。既要依靠广大群众群策群力，又要依靠科学技术的正确指导，必须使两者密切地结合起来，才能取得应有的效果。当前最重要的一环在于把现有的科学技术为群众所掌握，成为同血吸虫病战斗的武器。目前需要科学技术研究工作解决的主要问题是：钉螺生态、更好的灭螺灭卵药物、口服药剂或其他新的药物、中医验方等等。第四、防治工作必须和发展农业生产、兴修水利相结合。防治工作和发展农业生产相结合的关键，是依靠从省（市）到乡的各级党政领导的统一安排，把防治工作的各项措施尽可能地和发展生产的各项措施结合起来进行。第五、必须坚决进行反复斗争，坚持到底，要求我们必须在思想上和组织上有充分的准备，坚决进行长期的反复的斗争，坚持不懈，有始有终，决不能半途而废。
    加强对防治血吸虫病工作的领导
    指示最后提出加强党和政府对防治血吸虫病工作的领导，是消灭血吸虫病害的基本保证，并规定流行地区乡以上各级人民委员会，凡是尚未建立防治委员会的，均应当迅速建立起来。为了保证防治工作不致被当前农村中各项繁重的任务所挤掉，流行地区各级人民委员会在规划每个时期的农村工作任务时，应当把防治血吸虫病工作列入生产规划，提出具体任务，同农村生产统一布置，统一检查贯彻执行。国务院和流行地区各级人民委员会的农业、卫生、水利等各有关部门，也应当根据每个时期防治工作的统一要求和各部门的业务情况，把有关的防治工作列入自己的工作计划内，认真组织执行。有防治任务的乡人民委员会，应当根据每个时期生产和防治工作的具体情况，领导农业生产合作社，统一地安排生产和防治工作的具体任务，及时地解决生产和防治工作安排上的具体矛盾，并妥善地处理病人在治疗中的工分问题。在病害严重的地区，农业生产合作社和生产队应该有一个副职干部专门领导防治工作。在血吸虫病流行的少数民族地区，布置和推动防治工作时，必须充分地照顾到他们的生活、生产习惯和宗教风俗特点，耐心地进行宣传教育，稳步地进行防治工作，在经济上和技术上给予他们大力的帮助和支持。
