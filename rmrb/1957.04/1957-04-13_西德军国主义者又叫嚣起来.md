West German Militarists are Ranting Again
By Our Staff Commentator

The West German militarist elements are becoming increasingly rampant.

Recently, Adenauer has clamored more than once that West Germany should also possess atomic weapons. Defense Minister Strauss also openly stated: West Germany cannot lag behind in atomic power.

West German militarist elements are not only shouting, but are also making practical preparations for the production of atomic weapons. The European Atomic Energy Community plan, which would legalize West German manufacturing of atomic weapons, has been initially approved. West Germany’s first atomic reactor has already begun construction. According to West German newspapers, the West German Ministry of Defense has drafted a plan to use the latest achievements in nuclear physics and chemistry for military purposes. And some West German atomic energy physicists are studying the problem of manufacturing hydrogen bombs. Recently, under the direction of General Meitzel of the West German Defense Force General Staff, NATO forces conducted a large-scale atomic war exercise in West Germany with the Soviet Union as the hypothetical enemy.

At the same time that West German militarist elements are actively advocating and preparing for an atomic arms race, West German government figures have launched a propaganda campaign against socialist countries. Foreign Minister Brentano openly proposed to restore Germany's borders to those of 1937. Deputy Foreign Minister Hallstein openly declared socialist countries as mortal enemies. These two types of propaganda are clearly carried out according to a unified plan.

There is also some more noteworthy news. The American "New York American Journal" said that the West German government is planning an attack on East Germany. And, according to reports, West German Navy Commander Ruge clearly declared that the West German Navy must be ready at any time to harass the Soviet Union's maritime supply lines.

Why are West German militarist elements daring to be so rampant? This is inseparable from the activities of the United States in actively creating new tensions.

The US government is fueling an atomic arms race and trying to exacerbate international tensions. The US-UK Bermuda Conference communiqué openly announced that the two countries would continue to test nuclear weapons and rely on a policy of strength based on nuclear weapons. The United States also announced the supply of missiles to the United Kingdom and is actively working to deploy atomic weapons on the territory of other countries. Recently, it announced its readiness to supply atomic weapons to the armed forces of NATO countries, including West Germany. This has greatly encouraged the ambitions of West German militarist elements. Moreover, for several years, the United States has helped West Germany rearm, train officers, supply West Germany with large quantities of armaments, and promote Hitler's Nazi generals as commanders of NATO forces. Under the support of the United States, the feathers of the West German militarist elements have gradually become plump, and they have become somewhat carried away.

Adenauer's policies are becoming increasingly unpopular at home. Washington and West German militarist forces are already worried that in the upcoming elections this year, their "best horse in the stable" may collapse. Therefore, some methods are needed to alleviate anti-Adenauer sentiment and eliminate opposition to Adenauer's policies. One of the methods they seem to have planned is to incite revanchist chauvinistic sentiment.

However, playing with war and atomic weapons now contains greater dangers for the players than ever before. Recently, the Soviet government has repeatedly issued statements warning against treating atomic weapons as child's play. This warning cannot be ignored.

The West German militarists’ plan to engage in an atomic arms build-up can only make relations between East and West more tense and detrimental to the cause of German reunification.

It is precisely for this reason that the current West German government's proposal to equip the West German army with atomic weapons has been met with protests and opposition from the West German people and political figures. The Social Democratic Party and the Free Democratic Party have also repeatedly expressed their opposition to the West German army possessing atomic weapons. Social Democratic Party Chairman Ollenhauer also pointed out that engaging in atomic armaments "is a very dangerous thing."

The West German militarists would do well to remember the lessons they learned in World War II.

### 西德军国主义者又叫嚣起来

    西德军国主义者又叫嚣起来
    本报评论员
    西德军国主义分子愈来愈嚣张起来了。
    最近，阿登纳不止一次地叫嚣西德应当也拥有原子武器。国防部长施特劳斯也公开说：西德不能在原子力量方面落后。
    西德军国主义分子不仅只是叫喊，而且在进行生产原子武器的实际准备。将会使西德制造原子武器合法化的欧洲原子联营计划已经初步通过。西德第一个原子反应堆已经开始修建。据西德报纸报道，西德国防部已拟订了计划要用利用核子物理学和化学的最新成就为军事目标服务。而西德的某些原子能物理学家也正在研究制造氢弹的问题。最近，在西德国防军参谋部迈齐尔将军的主持下，北大西洋集团军队在西德进行了以苏联为假想敌人的大规模原子战争演习。
    就在西德军国主义分子积极鼓吹和准备原子军备竞赛的同时，西德政府人物发动了一个反对社会主义国家的宣传运动。外交部长勃伦塔诺公然提出要恢复德国1937年的疆界。外交部副部长哈尔斯坦公开宣布社会主义国家为死敌。这两种宣传显然是按照一个统一的计划进行的。
    还有一些更值得注意的消息。美国“纽约美国人日报”说，西德政府正在策划一个进攻民主德国的计划。而据报道，西德海军司令鲁格明白扬言西德海军必须随时做好战斗准备对苏联海上供应线进行骚扰。
    为什么西德军国主义分子敢于这样嚣张呢？这是跟美国积极制造新的紧张局势的活动分不开的。
    美国政府正在煽起一个原子军备竞赛并力图加剧国际紧张局势。美英百慕大会谈公报公然宣布两国要继续试验核武器和依靠核武器的实力政策。美国并宣布供应英国导弹，还积极活动在其他国家的领土上配置原子武器。最近它又宣布准备把原子武器供给包括西德在内的北大西洋集团各国军队。这样就大大鼓励了西德军国主义分子的野心。而且几年来，美国帮助西德重新武装，训练军官，供应西德大批军火，并且把希特勒纳粹将领提拔为北大西洋集团军的司令官。在美国的扶植下，现在西德军国主义分子的羽毛已逐渐丰满，有些得意忘形起来了。
    阿登纳的政策在国内已日益不得民心。华盛顿和西德军国主义势力已经在担忧，在即将在今年举行的大选中，他们的这匹“厩中最好的马”可能会要垮台。因此，需要用一些办法来缓和反阿登纳的情绪，排斥对阿登纳政策的反对。看来他们策划的办法之一就是煽动复仇的沙文主义情绪。
    但是，玩弄战争和原子武器，现在比过去任何时候对玩弄者包含更大的危险。最近苏联政府一再发表声明，警告不要把原子武器当作儿戏。这种警告是不容忽视的。
    西德军国主义者这种搞原子军备的计划，也只能使东西方的关系更加紧张而不利于德国统一的事业。
    正是因为如此，目前西德政府想用原子武器来装备西德军队的主张，遭到了西德人民和政界人士的抗议和反对。社会民主党和自由民主党也都不断表示反对西德军队拥有原子武器。社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔并且指出搞原子军备“是一件非常危险的事情”。
    西德军国主义者最好还是记取他们在第二次大战中所得到的教训。
