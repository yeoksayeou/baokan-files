Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 2nd: President Sukarno announced to reporters at 1:15 PM today that Suwirjo's attempt to form a cabinet had failed. President Sukarno said that, given this situation, he would take action within two or three days.

Suwirjo had stated yesterday that he was able to complete his cabinet formation task, but unexpected changes occurred last night: the Indonesian Islamic Union Party very firmly demanded the position of Minister of Education and Culture, a position that Suwirjo had already decided would be held by Professor Prijono. The Islamic Teachers Association expressed its support for the Islamic Union Party's demand.

This morning, the Islamic Union Party announced its refusal to join the cabinet, and the Islamic Teachers Association followed by once again expressing its support for the Islamic Union Party's position. Due to this sudden change, the cabinet formation work suffered a setback at the final moment before its imminent success.

    苏加诺宣布苏维约组阁失败
    并说他将在两三天内采取行动
    据新华社雅加达2日电　今天下午一时十五分，苏加诺总统向记者宣布苏维约组阁失败。苏加诺总统说，由于这种情况，他将在两、三天内采取行动。
    苏维约在昨天还表示他能够完成他的组阁任务，但是昨天夜里发生了意外的变化：印度尼西亚伊斯兰联盟党非常坚决地要求获得文教部长的席位，而这一席位苏维约已确定由普里约诺教授担任。伊斯兰教师联合会表示支持伊斯兰联盟党的要求。
    今天上午，伊斯兰联盟党宣布拒绝入阁，伊斯兰教师联合会接着再一次表示支持伊斯兰联盟党的立场。由于这个突然的变化，组阁工作在即将成功的最后关头遭到失败。
