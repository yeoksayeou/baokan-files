Properly Delegating Power Brings Many Benefits
Chen Wen

Hongzhao County, Shanxi Province, appropriately delegated the management power of agricultural cooperatives to the production teams. In March, most agricultural production cooperatives in the county distributed this year's production plans to the production teams, and, under the premise of contracting production, work, and investment, each team formulated increased production plans according to specific conditions. It was also clearly stipulated that the part of the actual output of each production team exceeding the contracted amount would be distributed independently by each team as basic work points. After doing this, the increased production targets of all agricultural cooperatives generally increased by about 10%, which powerfully promoted the spring plowing production campaign.

In order to facilitate each production team to fully realize its production potential and complete its increased production plan, the cooperatives delegated a certain scope of management power to each production team. Currently, Hongzhao County has decided that the following tasks can be handled flexibly by the production teams:

The planting area of various crops can be appropriately adjusted by each production team within a limit of 15% increase or decrease. For example, if the cooperative's plan originally stipulated that a certain production team should plant 100 mu of rice, the production team can, on the premise of ensuring the completion of the total output value planned by the cooperative, decide for itself between 85 mu and 115 mu according to the conditions of each team.

Work quotas are uniformly stipulated by the cooperative for 150 to 160 items. In the past, due to frequent changes in natural conditions and specific circumstances, each team mechanically recorded work points according to the cooperative's quotas, which was sometimes unreasonable, and there was a phenomenon of picking and choosing easy tasks among the members. This year, each production team has the right to flexibly increase or decrease the quotas within a range of 5% according to the specific circumstances, according to the regulations of the cooperative.

In terms of sideline production, it is stipulated which are managed uniformly by the cooperative, and which are managed by the team and individuals. The income from the team's operation is either entirely owned by the team or individuals, or dividends are shared between the team and the cooperative according to a certain proportion. In this way, each team can flexibly allocate manpower at any time according to the situation of agricultural work, so that agricultural production is not delayed and sideline production can be appropriately managed.

The cooperative stipulates the production investment belonging to each team, and the labor plan made by the cooperative. In order to fully utilize investment and fully exert labor power, the production team can make other arrangements.

This system has many benefits. First, the cooperative's plans and various regulations can be adjusted by the production team to better conform to the actual situation and ensure increased production. Second, it is convenient to reasonably adjust the interests of the collective and the individual, and to give play to the enthusiasm of each production team and all members on the basis of ensuring the completion of the cooperative's plan. Third, this system can overcome the bureaucratic work style and excessive busyness of some leaders in the cooperative, and also makes it easier for cooperative cadres to participate in production. In the past, the members once said that the situation after the establishment of the advanced cooperative was that "there are more people eating, and fewer people worrying," and only a few cooperative cadres were worrying about the production and life of hundreds or thousands of people in the entire cooperative. By adopting the method of expanding the management power of the production team, this situation can be fundamentally changed.

Of course, this new system will also bring some new problems. For example, after the team's responsibility and independence are strengthened, how the cooperative management committee should strengthen specific leadership, etc., still needs to be solved in practice.

In the political report made on behalf of the Party Central Committee at the "Eighth National Congress," Comrade Liu Shaoqi proposed: "Only when the members feel that they are indeed the masters of the cooperative, and that the income of the members can increase every year, can such a cooperative be consolidated." Undoubtedly, this new measure in Hongzhao County is able to enhance the members' sense of ownership, and it also makes each member believe that through their own efforts, this year's income will continue to increase.

    权力适当下放好处多
    陈文
    山西省洪赵县把农业社的经营管理权适当地下放给了生产队。3月份，全县大部分农业生产合作社，把今年生产计划分配到生产队，在包产包工包投资的前提下，由各队按照具体条件，订出增产计划；并明确规定，各生产队实际产量超过包产数的部分，基本工归各队自行分配。这样做了以后，所有农业社的增产指标一般都提高了10％左右，有力地推动了春耕生产运动。
    为了便于各个生产队充分发挥生产潜力，完成增产计划，各社把一定范围内的经营管理权交给了各个生产队。目前洪赵县决定可由生产队机动处理的工作有下面几项：
    各种作物播种的面积，各生产队可以在增减15％的限度内，作适当调整。比如原来按社的计划，规定某个生产队播种水稻一百亩；生产队在保证完成社里的计划的总产值的前提下，可按各队的条件，在八十五亩到一百十五亩之间，自行决定。
    工作定额，由社统一规定的有一百五、六十个项目。过去，由于自然条件和具体情况常有变化，各队机械地按照社里的定额记工，有的时候就会不合理，社员中也有挑肥拣瘦的现象。今年，各生产队有权按照社的规定，在5％的范围里，按具体情况灵活增减。
    在副业生产上，规定了哪些由社统一经营，哪些由队和个人经营。各队经营的所得，有的全部归队或个人，有的按一定比例由队和社分红，这样，各队就可以随时按照农活的情况，机动地调配力量，既可不误农业生产，又能适当经营副业。
    社里规定属于各队的生产投资，社里所做的劳动规划，生产队为了充分利用投资和充分发挥劳动力，都可以另作安排。
    这种制度有不少好处。首先，社的计划和各项规定，可以经过生产队的调整，更加符合实际情况，保证增产。其次，便于合理地调整集体和个人的利益，在保证完成全社计划的基础上，发挥各个生产队和全体社员的积极性。再次，这种制度可以克服社内某些领导人员的官僚主义作风和过分忙乱的现象，也便于社干部有时间参加生产。过去，社员们曾经说高级社成立以后的情况是“吃饭的人多，操心的人少”，全社几百几千人的生产、生活，只有少数社干部在操心。采用扩大生产队经营管理权的办法，就可以从根本上改变这种状况。
    当然，这种新的制度，也会带来一些新的问题。例如：队的责任和独立性加强了以后，社管理委员会怎样加强具体领导，等等，还需要在实践中注意解决。
    刘少奇同志代表党中央在“八大”所作的政治报告中提出过：“只有使社员感觉到自己确实是合作社的主人翁，而且使社员的收入能够每年有所增加，这样的合作社才能够巩固。”无疑的，洪赵县的这种新措施，是能够提高社员的主人翁感觉的，它并且使每个社员相信，经过自己的努力，今年收入一定会继续增加。
