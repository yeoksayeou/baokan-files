Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 16th: Soviet newspapers today published in full the reply from Norwegian Prime Minister Gerhardsen to the letter sent by Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Bulganin on March 19th of this year. In his letter, Bulganin expressed his opinions to the Norwegian Prime Minister on issues such as the international situation, Soviet-Norwegian relations, and the dangers that the plan to deploy atomic weapons on the territory of NATO member states would bring to these countries.

In his reply, Gerhardsen agreed with Bulganin's view that the international situation has recently become seriously complicated. Gerhardsen said that there is still no trust and cooperation in the world that is necessary to guarantee international peace.

Subsequently, he described the reasons for Norway's participation in the Atlantic Treaty. At the same time, the Norwegian Prime Minister reiterated that his government would never sponsor a policy of aggression, and it would not allow the use of Norwegian territory to promote such a policy.

In response to what Bulganin said in his letter, that due to participation in NATO, Norway might be forced to violate its own will and national interests by agreeing to station foreign bombers and warships and store atomic weapons on Norwegian territory, Gerhardsen said that this statement was caused by misunderstanding. He said that the basic principle of cooperation within the framework of NATO is that each contracting party fully retains the right to act according to its own wishes.

When Gerhardsen talked about the issue of disarmament, he said that the Norwegian government was satisfied with what Bulganin said about the Soviet government attaching particular importance to this issue and believing that disarmament is a completely solvable task.

Gerhardsen also said that the Norwegian government attaches particular importance to reaching an agreement on resolving issues related to nuclear weapons as soon as possible. Gerhardsen's reply showed that he believed that this issue was limited to reaching an agreement on registering the testing of such weapons.

Gerhardsen finally talked about the Norwegian side being very satisfied with the development of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Norway in the period after his visit to the Soviet Union. He believes that it is necessary to develop trade and other business ties between the two countries, and expressed his belief that all issues of concern to the authorities of both countries will be studied and resolved in a friendly spirit.

    基哈德森复信给布尔加宁说
    挪威政府决不赞助侵略政策
    据新华社16日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联各报今天全文刊载了挪威首相基哈德森对苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁今年3月19日去信的复信。布尔加宁在信里就国际局势、苏挪关系和北大西洋公约组织在它的成员国领土上配置原子武器的计划将会给这些国家带来的危险等问题，向挪威首相陈述了意见。
    基哈德森在复信中赞成布尔加宁表示的国际局势近来严重复杂化的看法。基哈德森说，现在在世界上还没有保障国际和平所必需的信任和合作。
    随后，他叙述了挪威参加大西洋公约的理由。同时，挪威首相重申他的政府决不会赞助侵略政策，它不允许利用挪威领土推行这种政策。
    基哈德森在答复布尔加宁信中所说的，由于参加北大西洋公约组织，挪威可能被迫违背自己的意志和民族利益而同意在挪威境内驻扎外国轰炸机、军舰和贮存原子武器这一点时说，这种说法是由于误会而引起的。他说，北大西洋公约范围内合作的基本原则正是每个缔约国完全保留按自己的愿望行事的权利。
    基哈德森谈到裁军问题的时候说，挪威政府对布尔加宁所说的苏联政府特别重视这个问题，并且认为裁军是一个完全可以解决的任务感到满意。
    基哈德森还说，挪威政府特别重视尽早就解决同核武器有关的问题取得协议。基哈德森的答复表明，他认为这个问题只限于就登记这种武器的试验取得协议。
    基哈德森最后谈到挪威方面对于在他本人访问苏联之后的时期内，苏挪两国友好联系的发展十分满意。他认为必须发展两国之间的贸易和其他事务联系，并且表示相信，两国当局所关心的一切问题将本着友好的精神来加以研究和求得解决。
