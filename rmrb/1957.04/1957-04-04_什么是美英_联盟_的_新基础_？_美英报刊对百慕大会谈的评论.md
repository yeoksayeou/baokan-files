What is the "New Foundation" of the US-British "Alliance"?
Comments from American and British Newspapers on the Bermuda Talks

Following the Bermuda talks, some American and British newspapers hailed that the "alliance" between the United States and Britain had been rebuilt on a "new foundation." The American "New York Times" wrote in its March 25th editorial: "President Eisenhower and Prime Minister Macmillan have eliminated the discord between the United States and Britain caused by the Suez Canal crisis and have laid a solid foundation for the restoration of the special relationship linking the English-speaking world." The British "Times" also believes that the Bermuda talks communiqué proves that the Anglo-American alliance has been renewed and stabilized.

But what exactly is the "new foundation" of the so-called US-British "alliance"? Many American and British newspapers have also published articles to explain it. Now, we have selected four of them to translate and publish below:

American "Business Week" said:

	The "Alliance" was Reconciled on American Terms
	Britain Plays an Obviously Secondary Partner

The American "Business Week" wrote on March 30th under the title "Britain Reluctantly Lets Go of Fading Power":

	Today, Britain barely maintains a purely second-rate position in the world—far behind the United States and the Soviet Union. In fact, history is developing so rapidly that it threatens to cast Britain aside, making it either a mere American appendage if it does not share the fate of Western Europe.

	President Eisenhower and Prime Minister Macmillan reconciled the Anglo-American alliance in Bermuda last weekend, but largely on American terms, with Britain playing an obviously secondary partner. At the end of the talks, it became clear that Britain could no longer take any action in the Middle East or South Asia without consulting the United States, and only a common policy now exists in Europe.

	When looking at the rescue work in the Bermuda talks, one should remember the purpose that former Prime Minister Eden had in mind when he decided to attack Egypt with France. Obviously, what Eden was thinking of was not just defeating Nasser and eliminating Soviet influence in that region, although this was important to ensure Britain's and Western Europe's increasing oil supplies. Eden also hoped to restore Britain's dominant position in that region, so that the United States would have to follow his policies, instead of him following American policies.

	As things stand now, Britain needs to rely on the United States more than ever before to protect its oil supplies and its oil profits. Furthermore, Britain is no longer a country that can act on its own in the Mediterranean. Power in the Mediterranean, as well as throughout the Middle East except for Iraq and the Persian Gulf, is in the hands of the United States. Some British people believe that letting the United States join the Baghdad Pact Military Committee is a further concession of power to the United States.

American "Baltimore Sun" said:

	Reintegration is Just a "Temporary Partnership"
	The United States Decides to Continue to "Go it Alone" in the Middle East

The American "Baltimore Sun" published an article by Paul W. Ward on March 24th under the title "Analysis":

	The British Prime Minister came here on Wednesday (referring to Bermuda), and by tonight, he has finally managed to end the "separation" (between the United States and Britain). But he did not restore the "integration" to the extent of being close to a "both good and new" foundation.

	What he did accomplish was a reintegration on a limited or "temporary partnership" basis.

	Macmillan failed to convince Eisenhower... to handle the Middle East issue... in cooperation with Britain and France again.

	The Eisenhower administration wants the freedom to "go it alone" in the Middle East. It believes that it is most likely to obtain this freedom through the United Nations. In any case, expressing loyalty to this world organization will continue to provide it with an effective excuse to reject the suggestion of Britain and any other or all allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization wanting to take joint action in the Middle East.

	The Eisenhower administration will continue to take a "two is company, three's a crowd" attitude. It feels that if John Bull is following close behind, Uncle Sam's actions to please the Arabs will be hindered, especially since the Arabs continue to adopt the approach of "whoever is John Bull's friend cannot be my friend."

British "Manchester Guardian" said:

	The United States is the Big Partner in the "Alliance"
	Britain Participates in at Most a "Limited Partnership"

The British "Manchester Guardian" published an article by Friedman on March 25th under the title "The United States is the Big Partner, the ‘General Agreement’ is Very General":

	Apart from the restoration of personal relationships, there was hardly any remarkable achievement in the Bermuda talks, despite some accustomed, almost formulaic words about policy agreements. American journalists often mentioned the disturbing decline of Britain's influence in world affairs.

	They say that another sign of this decline can be seen from Macmillan's talks in Bermuda, where Macmillan said that Britain's military obligations around the world must be reduced. The Americans concluded that, in most cases, they would have to take up the burdens that Britain had dropped. The statement that the two governments would make special efforts to achieve consistency in Middle East policy did not arouse much enthusiasm either. More emphatic assurances of unity were issued after Eden's last visit to the White House, but what followed was first the ineffectiveness of this alliance, and then the open rupture of the alliance.

	Apparently, some British newspapers interpreted the American decision to join the Baghdad Pact Military Committee as a victory for Mr. Macmillan's persuasiveness in Bermuda. But this joy cannot be reconciled with what everyone in Washington knows. Because the Eisenhower administration had agreed on this policy at least a week before the Bermuda conference began. The reason why this statement was delayed was to allow President's Special Envoy Richards to have the opportunity to inform the Middle Eastern member states of the Baghdad Pact directly of this news.

	Some reporters pointed out that the earlier optimistic reports that the conference had reached a general agreement did not correctly reflect the true situation.

	The general opinion seems to be: The Bermuda talks illustrate and consolidate the United States' position as the overwhelmingly dominant big partner in the alliance. Britain is allowed to participate in at most a "limited partnership."

British "Daily Mirror" said:

	Britain Gave Up its Strategic Independence
	The Defense System Will Be Under Direct American Control

The "Daily Mirror" published an article by Richard Crossman on March 26th under the title "How Much Did Macmillan Have to Pay in Bermuda Then!"

	What Ike did was to tie Britain tightly into the American defense system, making it completely impossible for us to "act alone" in the future. This is the true meaning of the missile agreement between him and Mr. Macmillan....

	This new type of nuclear weapon will be supplied on generous lend-lease terms, without having to pay any dollars at all....

	All this sounds like a wonderful demonstration of American generosity; but this is not the case if we realize that the so-called "British deterrent" will no longer be controlled by Britain.

	Each "Thor" missile must be operated by a joint British-American team, because its nuclear warhead will remain an American secret, and the decision to use it must be made by the American President.

	Mr. Macmillan, in accepting this American proposal, is in fact giving up Britain's strategic independence.

	According to the Bermuda agreement, we have accepted for the first time ever the direct control of the United States over a large part of our defense system. But we are also losing the opportunity for economic recovery because we want to continue to manufacture our own British nuclear weapons. The Prime Minister actually miscalculated on both sides.

	Worse than the missile deal is the agreement on hydrogen bomb testing. They tell us that the British will continue their own hydrogen bomb tests, and the Americans will continue theirs; and the Russians can send experts to observe our tests, if we can send experts to observe theirs.

	If this is the initial achievement after the restoration of the Anglo-American alliance, then God help us!

	Instead of agreeing in principle to the Russian proposal to test the sincerity of the proposal, the President and the Prime Minister sounded as if they were afraid that it was sincere.

### 什么是美英“联盟”的“新基础”？  美英报刊对百慕大会谈的评论

专栏：外论摘要

    什么是美英“联盟”的“新基础”？
    美英报刊对百慕大会谈的评论
    百慕大会谈结束以后，美国和英国的某些报刊欢呼道：美英两国之间的“联盟”已经在一个“新的基础”上重建起来了。美国“纽约时报”在3月25日的社论中写道：“艾森豪威尔总统和麦克米伦首相已经消除了苏伊士运河危机所引起的美英间的不和，并且已经为联系英语世界的特殊关系的恢复奠定了坚实的基础。”英国“泰晤士报”也认为百慕大会谈公报证明英美联盟已经焕然一新和得到了稳定。
    但是，所谓美英“联盟”的“新基础”究竟是什么呢？美国和英国的不少报刊也发表了一些文章来加以说明。现在，我们选择其中的四篇摘译发表如下：
    美国“商业周刊”说：
    按美国条件弥合了两国“联盟”  英国扮演一个显然次要的伙伴
    3月30日美国“商业周刊”以“英国对日渐衰退的权力依依不舍”为题写道：
    今天，英国勉强保持住了在世界上的纯粹是二等的地位——远远落后于美国以及苏联。事实上，历史发展得如此迅速，以至于它势将把英国扔在一旁，使它不与西欧共命运就非成为纯粹的美国附庸不可。
      艾森豪威尔总统和麦克米伦首相上周末在百慕大弥合了英美联盟，不过在很大程度上是按照美国的条件这样做的，而由英国扮演一个显然次要的伙伴。在会谈结束时显然表明英国已不再能不同美国磋商而在中东或南亚采取任何行动了，只有在欧洲现在还存在着一种共同政策。
    在看百慕大会谈中的挽救工作的时候，应该想到前首相艾登在决定同法国一起进攻埃及时所抱的目的。显然，艾登所想的并不
  仅仅是打垮纳赛尔和扫除苏联在那个地区的影响，虽然这对保障英国和西欧的日益增加的石油供应是重要的。艾登还希望恢复英国在那个地区的统治地位，而使美国必须遵从他的政策，而不是它遵从美国的政策。
    照目前的情况看来，英国现在在保护它的石油供应和它的石油利润方面，比以前任何时候更加需要依靠美国。此外，英国在地中海已经不再是一个可以自作主张的国家。地中海以及除了伊拉克和波斯湾以外的整个中东地区的权力，都握在美国手中。某些英国人认为，让美国参加巴格达条约军事委员会是进一步把权力让给美国。
    美国“巴尔的摩太阳报”说：
    重新结合只是“暂时的搭伴”  美国决定继续在中东“单干”
    3月24日美国“巴尔的摩太阳报”以“分析”为题发表了保罗·伍·罗德的文章说：
    英国首相星期三来到了这里（指百慕大），到今晚止，他终于设法结束了（英美之间的）“分离”。但是他并没有使“结合”恢复到接近“既好又新”的基础的那种程度。
    而他所做到的，是在有限的或“暂时搭伴”的基础上的那种重新结合。
    麦克米伦未能说服艾森豪威尔……重新在同英国和法国合作下……来处理中东问题。
    艾森豪威尔政府希望它有自由在中东“单干”。它认为，通过联合国最可能获得这种自由。不管怎么样，表示忠实于这个世界组织将会继续为它提供有效的借口，来拒绝英国和北大西洋公约组织中的任何其他盟国或全部盟国想在中东采取合伙行动的建议。
    艾森豪威尔政府将继续采取一种“两个人是友伴，三个人是多余的”态度。它感到如果让约翰牛紧跟在后头，山姆大叔讨好阿拉伯人的行动将会受到妨碍，特别是因为阿拉伯人继续采取了“谁是约翰牛的朋友就不能是我的朋友”的方针。
    英国“曼彻斯特卫报”说：
    美国是“联盟”中的大合伙人  英国至多参加“有限的合伙”
    3月25日英国“曼彻斯特卫报”以“美国是大合伙人，‘一般协议’很一般”为题发表了弗里德曼的一篇文章说：
    除了私人关系的恢复之外，在百慕大的会谈中简直没有获得什么了不起的成就，尽管有一些关于政策协议的看惯了的、几乎是官样文章的词句，美国记者却常常提到英国在世界事务中的影响衰落的令人不安的话。
    他们说从麦克米伦在百慕大的谈话中可以看到这种没落的又一迹象，麦克米伦说，英国在世界各地的军事义务必须减少。美国人的结论是，在大多数的情况下，他们只好负起英国扔下的担子。所谓两国政府要特别努力以求在中东政策方面取得一致的声明也没有引起多大热情。在艾登上次访问白宫后发表过更为强调的团结的保证，但是继之而来的首先是这种同盟的无效，后来便是同盟的公然的破裂。
    显然英国某部分报纸把美国决定参加巴格达条约军事委员会解释成为麦克米伦先生在百慕大说服力的胜利。但是无法把这种欣悦之情和在华盛顿大家都知道的事情调和起来。因为艾森豪威尔政府至少在百慕大会议开始前一个星期就商定了这种政策。这个声明之所以迟迟未发表是要让总统特使理查兹先生有机会把这个消息直接通知巴格达条约中东成员国。
    某些记者指出，早先说这个会议已取得一般协议的乐观的报道没有正确地反映出真正的情况。
    总的意见看来是：百慕大会谈说明并巩固了美国在联盟中作为占压倒优势的大合伙人的地位。英国至多被允许参加“有限的合伙”。
    英国“每日镜报”说：
    英国出让了自己的战略独立  国防体系将受美国直接控制
    3月26日“每日镜报”以“麦克米伦当时在百慕大得付出多大的代价！”为题发表了理查德·克罗斯曼的文章说：
    艾克所做的是把英国紧紧地缚在美国的防御体系里，弄得我们今后完全不可能“单独行动”了。这就是他和麦克米伦先生之间关于导弹的协议的真正意义……。
    这种新型原子核武器将以优厚的租借条件供应，完全不需要支付美元……。
    所有这些，听起来好像出色地表明了美国的慷慨；但如果我们认识到所谓“英国的威慑力量”将不再由英国控制，情况就不是这样了。
    每个“雷神”式导弹必须由一个英美联合小组来操纵，因为它的原子核弹头仍将是美国的秘密，而且要由美国总统作出决定才能使用。
    麦克米伦先生在接受美国这一建议的时候，实际上是出让了英国的战略独立。
    按照百慕大协定的规定，我们破天荒第一次接受了美国对我们国防体系在很大程度上的直接控制。但是我们同时也因为要继续制造英国自己的原子核武器而失去经济恢复的机会。首相实际上在两方面都失算了。
    比导弹交易更坏的是关于氢弹试验的协议。他们告诉我们，英国人将继续自己的氢弹试验，美国人将继续进行他们的；而俄国人可以派遣专家观察我们的试验，假如我们能派专家去观察他们的试验的话。
    假如这就是英美联盟恢复以后的初步成就，那么上帝保佑我们吧！
    总统和首相对于俄国人的建议不是原则上同意从而试探这个建议的真诚程度，相反地，他们的口气听起来好像唯恐它是真诚的。
