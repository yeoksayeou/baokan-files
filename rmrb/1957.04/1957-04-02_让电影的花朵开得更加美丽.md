Let the Flowers of Cinema Bloom More Beautifully

	In order to report to the broad audience on the achievements of the film industry in 1956, the "New Film Exhibition Week" of domestic films from 1956 will be held successively in thirteen cities across the country from April 1st. Except for the animation films that are prepared for separate exhibitions, other types of films have selected a part to participate in this exhibition. Through this concentrated exhibition, the broad audience will have a more comprehensive view of the film production situation last year, and will widely solicit audience opinions to improve the film industry.
	1956 was a year of great development for China's film industry. The output of various films increased by more than 25% compared with 1955, and the output of feature films doubled. The quality of the films has also improved compared with the past, the themes of the films are broader than before, and the styles are more diverse. Among the productions in 1956, in terms of subject matter, there were more films depicting intellectuals and historical figures; in terms of style, there were more comedy films; especially the feature films reflecting the great War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea that our broad audience has long been eager for, films adapted from excellent literary works, films depicting historical figures and reflecting the current socialist construction, have appeared one after another. This is an important contribution made by film workers last year to the people of the whole country. The films released in 1956, such as "For Peace," "The New Year Sacrifice," "Shangganling," and "Mother," have all been well received by the audience. "Li Shizhen" and "Battle in the Desert," which were exhibited in Shanghai, have also been praised by the audience. In particular, "Shangganling" created an unprecedented record of audience numbers when it was screened in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin, creating a craze. As for the production of comedy and critical films, the attempts at national style, such as the use of national music in films, and the increase in the number of color films, all show that the film industry has made new achievements. All of this proves that domestic films are moving forward. Of course, I would also like to point out that our films depicting the lives of peasants and workers are far behind life and not rich and colorful enough, the proportion of films recording operas is relatively large in quantity, and the adaptation of famous literary works has not reached the proper level. These are the main shortcomings in last year's productions, and our film workers still need to make further efforts.
	Film is an important part of people's cultural life, and it is an important tool for educating the people and encouraging the people to carry out socialist construction. Based on this requirement, I deeply feel that our films are far behind the requirements of the country and the people, and have not reflected the appearance of our country's great construction and the extremely rich life of the people. Therefore, we look forward to film workers producing more and better films to meet the needs of the country and the people.
	Since the Party Central Committee put forward the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend last year, film workers have conducted many discussions and studies. The film leadership department has formulated a number of major measures to improve the organizational form and leadership style of film production. For example, changing the past system of script and film review and approval, handing it over to the film studio, delegating artistic responsibility, advocating free combination of artistic creators, cultivating the unique style of artistic creation, and changing the salary system of creators. The implementation of these measures will rapidly change the past shortcomings such as over-centralized management and excessive interference in artistic creation, and give more play to the enthusiasm of creators, providing conditions for implementing the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom from the organizational and institutional aspects. However, I believe that to produce more and better films, we cannot rely solely on reforming the organizational system, but must require the film leadership department, the film studio, film workers, especially creative personnel, to vigorously implement the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom in film art creation. Film is different from other artistic creations. It is not only an art form but also an industrial product. It is more collective in nature. It requires a large amount of investment from the country, and the number of its audience is very large (generally millions or tens of millions in domestic screenings), and the impact on the audience is also very large. Therefore, when implementing the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom, we must consider these characteristics and improve film production.
	The prosperity of film art creation and the production of more and better films depend on the efforts of film creators. Under the guidance of the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom, we should better serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serve the cause of socialist construction. We hope that our film artists, first of all, our film screenwriters, directors, and other creative workers, will better understand the rich and colorful real life, draw nourishment from real life, and carry out creation better. Secondly, it is necessary for our film artists to further strengthen political study, delve into film business, improve the level of film skills, and strive to create a new socialist national film!

    让电影的花朵开得更加美丽

    为了向广大观众汇报1956年电影事业的成就，从4月1日起，先后在全国十三个城市举行1956年国产影片的“新片展览周”。除美术片准备单独展览外，其他各种影片都选择了一部分参加这次的展出。通过这次集中的展览，将使广大观众较为全面地看到去年制片情况，并将广泛征求观众意见，以改进电影事业。
    1956年是我国电影事业发展较大的一年，各种影片的产量较1955年都增加了25％以上，其中故事片的产量增加达一倍。影片质量亦较前有所提高，影片题材较前广阔，样式亦较为多样了。1956年的出品中，就题材说，增加了表现知识分子的，历史人物的；就样式说，增加了喜剧的影片；特别是我们广大观众渴望已久的反映伟大的抗美援朝斗争的故事片、从优秀的文学作品改编的影片、刻划历史人物和反映当前社会主义建设的影片，已经陆续出现了，这是去年电影工作者对全国人民的重要贡献。1956年出品中已上映的影片如“为了和平”、“祝福”、“上甘岭”、“母亲”，都得到了观众的好评，在上海展览过的“李时珍”、“沙漠里的战斗”也都受到观众的称赞，特别是“上甘岭”，在北京、上海、天津等城市上映时，形成了热潮，创造了观众数量的空前纪录。至于喜剧和批评性影片的摄制，民族风格的尝试，如电影中民族音乐的运用，彩色影片的数量增加，都说明了电影事业有了新的成绩。这一切都证明国产影片是在迈步前进。当然，我也想指出：我们的影片表现农民、工人生活的作品还大大落后于生活和不够丰富多采，纪录戏曲的影片在数量上比重较大了些，改编文学名著还没有达到应有的水平，这些都是去年出品中的主要缺点，还需要我们电影工作者作进一步的努力。
    电影是人民文化生活中的重要部分，是教育人民和鼓舞人民进行社会主义建设的重要工具，从这一要求出发，我深感我们的电影还大大落后于国家和人民的要求，还远远没有反映出我们国家伟大建设的面貌和极其丰富的人民群众的生活。因此，我们期待着电影工作者摄制更多的和更好的影片，以满足国家和人民的要求。
    自从去年党中央提出百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针以后，电影工作者作了多次的讨论和研究，电影领导部门已定出了若干重大措施，以改进电影制片生产的组织形式和领导方式。如改变过去剧本、影片审查批准的制度，交由制片厂负责，将艺术责任下放，提倡艺术创作人员自由组合，培养艺术创作的独特风格，改变创作人员的工资制度等，这些措施的实行，将迅速改变过去管理过分集中、对艺术创作干涉过多等缺点，更多地发挥创作人员的积极性，从组织和制度方面提供了贯彻百花齐放的方针的条件。但是，我认为要摄制更多更好的影片，绝不能只靠改革组织制度就能办到，而必须要求电影领导部门、制片厂、电影工作者，特别是创作人员，在电影艺术创作上大力贯彻百花齐放的方针。电影不同于其他艺术创作，它不仅是艺术品而且还是工业产品，它更富于集体创作的特性，它要国家给予大量的投资，它的观众对象的数目是很大的（在国内放映一般地也是几百万或几千万人），给观众的影响也是很大的，因此，在贯彻百花齐放方针的时候，必须考虑到这些特点，改进电影制片工作。
    电影艺术创作的繁荣，摄制更多更好的影片，有待于电影创作工作者的努力，在贯彻百花齐放的方针下，更好地为工农兵服务，为社会主义建设事业服务，希望我们电影艺术工作者首先是希望我们 电影编剧、导演以及其他的创作工作者，更好地去了解丰富多采的现实生活，从现实生活中吸取滋养，更好地进行创作。其次，我们电影艺术工作者有必要进一步地加强政治学习，钻研电影业务，提高电影技巧的水平，为创造社会主义的民族的新电影而努力！
