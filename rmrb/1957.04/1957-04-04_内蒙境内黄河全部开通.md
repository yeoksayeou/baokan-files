    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The ice prevention work on the Yellow River within Inner Mongolia concluded on March 30th. The entire river channel was open by that afternoon.

    This year, the ice layer on the Yellow River in Inner Mongolia was very thick, and the opening of the river was delayed. Thanks to the full protection of the dikes by local laborers and the timely bombing and blasting of large ice dams by the People's Liberation Army Air Force and artillery, the safety of farmland, people, and livestock on both banks was ensured.

    内蒙境内黄河全部开通
    据新华社讯　内蒙古境内的黄河防凌工作已在3月30日结束。这天下午河道全部开通。
    今年内蒙古境内的黄河冰层很厚，开河时间迟缓。由于各地民工全力防护堤岸，解放军空军和炮兵及时轰炸爆破了大冰坝，保证了两岸农田人畜的安全。
