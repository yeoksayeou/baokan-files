Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 4th: The Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Otto Grotewohl, stated at a plenary session of the People's Chamber on the 3rd: "The establishment of a disarmament zone including the two Germanys and their neighboring countries will create a vast zone of peace in the heart of Europe." He expressed that the GDR government welcomes the disarmament talks currently taking place in London and supports the proposals put forward by the Soviet Union in the negotiations.

　　Grotewohl reiterated the GDR government's proposal to limit the armed forces of the two Germanys. He pointed out that the GDR has reduced its armed forces to 90,000, while West Germany is intensifying its arms expansion. He said: Recent talks by the Supreme Commander of NATO forces, Norstad, indicate that the West German army will receive a supply of atomic weapons. West German militarists have also drafted plans to manufacture their own atomic weapons. Today, West Germany is the country in NATO with the largest number of American atomic weapon units stationed within its borders. He emphasized: "The Adenauer government, by agreeing to the stationing of American atomic weapon units in West Germany, must bear full responsibility before the German people for all the consequences arising therefrom."

　　Grotewohl warned: "All the schemes of West German revanchists to forcibly annex the German Democratic Republic into the imperialist camp will be defeated by the united forces of the socialist camp." He said: "Because militarists are attempting to stockpile weapons of mass destruction in West Germany and equip the West German army with such weapons, this cannot but force us to take relative measures."

　　Grotewohl also condemned West Germany's participation in the Little Europe Customs Union and the Western European "Euratom." He said that this is currently the main obstacle hindering Germany's development towards independence, peace, freedom, unity, and democracy, and it further demonstrates that the Adenauer government is completely inclined towards a military "solution" to the German question.

　　The plenary session of the People's Chamber, which opened on the 3rd, will last for two days.

    使欧洲心脏成为和平地区
    格罗提渥主张建立缩减军备区域
    新华社柏林4日电　德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥3日在人民议院全体会议上说：“建立一个包括两个德国和它们的邻国在内的缩减军备区域，将使欧洲的心脏部分存在一个广大的和平地区。”他表示，民主德国政府欢迎目前在伦敦举行的裁军谈判，并且表示支持苏联在谈判中提出的建议。
    格罗提渥重申民主德国政府关于限制两个德国的武装部队的建议。他指出，民主德国已经把它的武装部队减少到九万人，而西德却在加紧扩军。他说：北大西洋集团军队总司令诺斯塔德最近的谈话表明，西德军队将获得原子武器的供应。西德军国主义者也起草了自己制造原子武器的计划。今天的西德是北大西洋集团中驻扎美国原子武器部队最多的国家。他强调指出：“阿登纳政府由于同意了在西德驻扎美国原子武器部队，它就必须在德国人民面前对由此而产生的一切后果负完全责任”。
    格罗提渥警告说：“西德所有复仇主义分子想以武力把德意志民主共和国吞并到帝国主义阵营去的阴谋诡计都将被社会主义阵营的联合力量击败。”他说：“由于军国主义者企图在西德储备大规模毁灭性武器和以这样的武器来装备西德军队，这就不能不迫使我们采取相对的措施”。
    格罗提渥还谴责西德参加小欧洲关税同盟和西欧“原子能联营组织。”他说，这是目前阻挠德国向独立、和平、自由、统一和民主发展的主要障碍，它进一步表明阿登纳政府已经完全倾向于以武力“解决”德国问题。
    3日开幕的人民议院全体会议将举行两天。
