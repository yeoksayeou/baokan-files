Harvest

    Yunnan Rapeseed
    (Our newspaper, Kunming, 12th dispatch) Yunnan Province's more than 2.45 million mu of rapeseed will have a bumper harvest, with a total output expected to increase by more than 60% compared to last year.

    Last winter, the province overfulfilled its rapeseed sowing area target by more than 58,000 mu. In field management, the members of the agricultural cooperatives were even more active. Therefore, although some areas suffered from varying degrees of frost and drought, the average yield for the province as a whole (including radish rapeseed) is estimated to reach more than 55 jin per mu, an increase of 14.5% in yield per unit area compared to last year.
