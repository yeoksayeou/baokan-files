He said that Comrade Voroshilov came to China from afar to visit, bringing the fraternal friendship of the great Soviet people to our people, and will further enhance the rock-solid unity between the Chinese and Soviet people. This increasingly strengthened great unity is an important condition for promoting our country's prosperity, a strong core for strengthening the unity of socialist countries, and an important guarantee for defending world peace.

I guarantee to convey the great gratitude represented by the banner to your closest friends—the Soviet people." At this time, the masses shouted "Long live!" and "Hurrah!" again to express their respect for Chairman Voroshilov.
