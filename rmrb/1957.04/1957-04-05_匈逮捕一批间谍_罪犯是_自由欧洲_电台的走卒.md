　　Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, April 4th: According to a report in the Hungarian newspaper "People's Freedom" on the 3rd, public security organs in Hungary's Borsod County recently arrested a group of spies sent by "Radio Free Europe." The main culprit in this group of spies, Ujlaki Csaba, had spied on important military intelligence and state secrets during the October events and fled to the West. At the American Embassy in Vienna, he established a spy relationship with "Radio Free Europe," which bought his intelligence at a high price and sent him back to Hungary to collect intelligence. After Ujlaki and his ten accomplices returned to Hungary, they engaged in large-scale espionage activities. While he was stealing important documents again, preparing to sneak across the border to Vienna, he was arrested by the Hungarian public security organs. Subsequently, other members of this spy organization were also caught.

    据新华社布达佩斯4日电　据匈牙利“人民自由报”3日报道，匈牙利包尔绍德州公安机关最近逮捕了一批“自由欧洲”电台派出的间谍。这批间谍的首要分子乌伊拉基·恰巴在十月事件中曾经刺探重要的军事情报和国家机密逃往西方。他在维也纳的美国大使馆同“自由欧洲”电台接上了间谍关系，它们用高价收买了他的情报，并且重新派他回到匈牙利来收集情报。乌伊拉基和他的十个同伙一起回到匈牙利以后，大肆进行间谍活动。在他又窃取了重要文件、准备偷越国境前往维也纳的途中，被匈牙利公安机关所逮捕。随后，这批间谍组织的其他成员也跟着落网了。
