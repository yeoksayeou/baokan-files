Heilongjiang is Taking Various Measures to Advance Preparations for Spring Planting Further
(Our report) Heilongjiang Province, currently in the period just before the ice melts and snow thaws, has greatly advanced its preparations for spring planting after reversing the slow pace and uneven progress. The attendance rate at general agricultural cooperatives has risen from the previous 50% to 70%-80%; the amount of manure delivered to the fields has increased from 15% at the beginning of March to 39%. Among these, some cooperatives, due to quick autumn harvesting and threshing last year, and through conducting realistic summaries of work during the Party rectification and cooperative consolidation, educating cadres, and encouraging members, have consistently maintained a mass attendance rate of over 85%, accumulated more fertilizer, and delivered it quickly. The women in these cooperatives have also actively participated in production – twisting straw ropes, weaving straw sacks, selecting seeds, and collecting manure. Some have even taken the time to make several pairs of shoes for the male members. They say, "This saves us from being held back by these small things when spring plowing begins."

However, there are still a few agricultural cooperatives that are not putting in enough effort. In addition to the large amount of snowfall last year and the lower temperatures this year compared to the same period in previous years, the leap August and delayed frost period have led to a "long spring neck, no need to rush" mentality among the masses. Another important reason is that the consolidation work in some cooperatives has been rough and not integrated with preparations for spring planting. To change this situation, leading organs at all levels in the province have not only issued several instructions and held relevant meetings, but also dispatched more than 2,000 cadres to greatly strengthen the leadership at the grassroots level, thereby greatly advancing the progress of rectification and preparations for spring planting in some weaker cooperatives. To further advance the preparations for spring planting, the province will comprehensively launch a mass campaign to inspect the preparations.

    黑龙江采取各种措施
    使备耕工作深入一步
    本报讯　目前正处在冰化雪消前夕的黑龙江省，在扭转了备耕生产迟缓和进度不平衡的局面后，全省的备耕工作已大大推进了一步。一般农业社的出勤率，已由先前的50％提高到70％—80％；送到地里的粪肥，更由3月初的15％增加到39％。其中，有一部分社，由于去年秋收打场迅速，在整党、整社中又实事求是地总结了工作，教育了干部，鼓舞了社员，因而群众出勤率一直保持在85％以上，积的肥多，送的也快，这些社的妇女，也积极参加了生产——搓草绳、织草袋、选种、拣粪，有的抽空儿为男社员做了好几双鞋。她们说：“省得春耕开始，为那些小事拖累。”
    但是，目前尚有少数农业社的劲头还不太足。除因去年降雪量大、今年气温比往年同期低一至二度，闰八月，霜期推迟，群众存在着：“春脖子长，不着忙”的思想外，有些社的整顿工作粗糙，没有和备耕生产结合起来进行，也是重要的原因之一。为改变这种状况，全省各级领导机关除发了若干指示和召开了有关会议外，又下派干部两千多名，大大加强了基层的领导力量，从而大大推进了一些薄弱社的整社和备耕工作的进度。为使备耕工作深入一步，这个省将全面开展群众性的备耕大检查。
