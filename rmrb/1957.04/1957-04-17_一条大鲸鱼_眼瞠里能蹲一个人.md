Xinhua News Agency dispatch: A whale weighing more than 100,000 catties was recently discovered on the beach in Jiangsu Province near the Yellow Sea.

This whale is more than six zhang long, more than five chi high, has long whiskers around its mouth, and black, scaleless skin. A person can even squat inside its eye socket. The entire skeleton on the ground looks like the frame of a house. According to relevant investigations, it is believed to be a fin whale. The cause of death may have been that it swam to the beach with the tide and did not have time to swim back out when the tide receded.

    一条大鲸鱼
    眼瞠里能蹲一个人
    据新华社讯　在江苏省黄海边沙滩上最近发现了一条十多万斤重的鲸鱼。
    这条鲸鱼身长六丈多，高五尺多，口有长须，皮黑色无鳞。眼睛瞠里也可以蹲一个人。整个鱼骨在地上好像一幢房子的结架一样。据有关方面考察，认为这是一条长须鲸。死的原因可能是它随着潮汛游到海滩，退潮时没来得及游去。
