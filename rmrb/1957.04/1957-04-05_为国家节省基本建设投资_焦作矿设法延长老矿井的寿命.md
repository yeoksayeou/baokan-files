Xinhua News Agency, Jiaozuo, April 4th. The Jiaozuo Mining Bureau is adopting various measures to extend the mining life of old mines, saving national capital construction investment.

	The Wangfeng and Lifeng coal mines, which produce the most coal for the mining bureau, have already been mined for more than thirty-five years. According to the original design, these mines had long exceeded their mining life. However, in the eight years since liberation, not only have these mines not been abandoned, but the coal production of these mines has also been increased by two to three times. For example, the Wangfeng mine produced only 300,000 tons of coal per year before liberation, but now it produces more than 1.2 million tons of coal per year.

	In order to extend the mining life of these old mines, the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau has taken the following measures: 1. Drain the accumulated water from the old areas and re-mine. Because the recovery rate was low before liberation, more than 70% of the coal reserves remain in the mined coal seams. After draining the accumulated water from the remaining coal seams, it can be re-mined. 2. Open up new mining areas and expand the coal mining face. Before liberation, these mines were naturally ventilated, so the coal mining face could not be expanded. Now it has been changed to mechanical ventilation, and the underground coal mining face can be greatly extended. 3. Increase the recovery rate. The recovery rate before liberation was only 30%. Now, without affecting safety, the recovery rate has been increased to over 80%. After these measures are taken, the Lifeng mine, which currently produces 600,000 tons of coal per year, can continue to be mined for more than 30 years; the Wangfeng mine, which produces more than 1.2 million tons per year, can also be extended for another ten years. The person in charge of the Jiaozuo Mining Bureau told reporters that the current production efficiency of these two coal mines is the highest, and the production cost is also the lowest, and they can hand over more than 3 million yuan in profits to the state every year. If two new mines with the same output were to be built, the state would have to invest more than 50 million yuan.

### 为国家节省基本建设投资  焦作矿设法延长老矿井的寿命

    为国家节省基本建设投资
    焦作矿设法延长老矿井的寿命
    新华社焦作4日电　焦作矿务局采取各种办法延长老矿井的开采年限，为国家节省基本建设投资。
    这个矿务局产煤最多的王封、李封两个煤矿，都已经开采过三十五年多。按照原来的设计，这些矿井早就超过了开采年限。但是，在解放以后的八年多来，不但没有废弃这些矿井，而且还把这些矿井的煤产量，提高了两倍到三倍。如王封矿，在解放以前年产不过三十万吨煤，现在已经年产一百二十多万吨煤。
    焦作矿务局为了延长这些老矿井的开采年限，采取了如下的措施：一、排除老区的积水，重新回采。由于解放以前的回采率低，已采过的煤层还有70％以上的煤藏量。在排除残煤层的积水以后，便可以重新回采。二、开拓新采区，扩大采煤面。解放以前，这些矿井都是自然通风，所以采煤面不能扩大。现在已改为机械通风，井下采煤面便可以大大伸长。三、提高回采率。解放以前的回采率不过30％。现在，在不影响安全的前提下，把回采率提高到80％以上。采取这些措施以后，现在年产六十万吨煤的李封矿，还可以继续开采三十多年；年产一百二十多万吨的王封矿，也能再延长开采十年。焦作矿务局的负责人对记者说，目前这两个煤矿的生产效率最高，生产成本也最低，每年可以为国家上缴利润三百多万元。如果要新建同样产量的两个新矿，国家就得投资五千多万元。
