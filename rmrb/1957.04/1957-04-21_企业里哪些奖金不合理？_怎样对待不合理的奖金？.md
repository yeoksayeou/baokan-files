    Which Bonuses are Unreasonable in Enterprises? How to Treat Unreasonable Bonuses?
    Editor's Note: On April 3rd, this newspaper published an article on page two entitled "A Communist Party Member's Extra Income," reporting on how a Communist Party member correctly treats the "extra income" obtained under backward piece-rate quotas. After the article was published, it aroused the interest of many readers. On April 20th, this newspaper published two letters from readers. Comrades Li Yusheng and Yi Ming raised the issue that full-time Party and mass organization cadres should not receive production task completion bonuses, and that bonuses should not be issued for exceeding production tasks under low targets. After these two letters were published, some readers raised different opinions. According to readers, there are more than just these unreasonable bonuses and "extra income" in enterprises currently, and opinions on what attitude should be taken towards these bonuses and "extra income" are not consistent. Therefore, we hope that everyone will continue to express their opinions on this issue.
    The Problem Isn't Here
    The readers' letters on page two of the People's Daily on April 20th aroused my interest. This issue does indeed need further discussion.
    I believe that the bonus issues criticized by Comrades Li Yusheng and Yi Ming are somewhat reasonable; however, they only see one aspect of the problem and do not see the other aspect. We know that if an enterprise completes or exceeds its production tasks, the directly producing workers certainly put in effort, but the enterprise's non-production personnel also put in effort. Every product in a factory enterprise contains not only the labor of general business personnel but also the labor of political and ideological workers. Because production is the result of people driving machines, and people rely on a certain level of political consciousness, full work enthusiasm, and vigorous fighting spirit to carry out production. Without the political work of the Party and mass organizations, it is difficult to imagine smoothly completing the planned tasks. In a specific sense, political work is a decisive force. Therefore, since enterprises can receive bonuses according to regulations after completing production tasks, there is no reason not to give the leadership (including the factory director and Party secretary) the bonuses they deserve when distributing them specifically. According to the principle of "to each according to his work," I believe that it is appropriate to appropriately broaden the scope of bonus distribution in enterprises. Since leaders have put in a lot of effort, it is reasonable for them to receive more bonuses than ordinary employees.
    Since the implementation of the bonus fund, the Party, Youth League, and trade union cadres in our factory have been particularly motivated whenever they receive bonuses, and their awareness of caring about the factory's production tasks has also been strengthened. It would be unfair to think that leaders receiving bonuses is a sign of "low consciousness." The Party has never denied the principle of material interests; on the contrary, it often pays attention to materially caring for the fruits of individual labor.
    Therefore, the problem is not whether full-time personnel of Party and mass organizations in enterprises should receive bonuses, but whether some enterprises have promptly revised backward labor quotas. For example, among the twenty-four substations of the Beijing Electric Power Bureau's high-voltage substation, sixteen were newly built or renovated after 1953, objectively creating very good conditions for safety. However, the safety bonus indicators implemented are still those formulated five years ago. Therefore, it is not difficult for employees to complete the bonus indicators, and it is easy to get bonuses. This is a clear example.
    Therefore, timely revision of backward quotas is the key to the problem.　　　Tian Gong
    Party and Mass Cadres Can Receive Bonuses
    On April 20th, the People's Daily published Comrade Li Yusheng's letter "After Reading 'A Communist Party Member's Extra Income'." After analyzing the bonus situation of the full-time cadres and employees of the Party committee, Youth League, and trade union of Tangshan Steel Plant, Comrade Li said: "According to the above-mentioned reasoning, I believe that the full-time cadres of Party organizations and trade unions and Youth League organizations in factories and mines should not be entitled to factory production task completion bonuses." I disagree with this view.
    The workers' production labor is very intense, and these full-time cadres are not just eating and doing nothing all day long. Their labor is also very intense and directly affects the completion of production tasks. Can the factory's production tasks be completed without the work of Party, Youth League, and trade union cadres in a factory? It is simply inconceivable. Moreover, the quarterly bonus evaluation of these full-time cadres after the factory completes its production tasks is stipulated by the higher authorities. For example, our Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant has formulated two quarterly bonus evaluation methods, A and B, according to the principles and regulations of the higher authorities: first-class factory administrative cadres receive a little over 38% of their salary, and second-class cadres receive 35.83% of their salary. The full-time cadres of the Party, Youth League, and trade union are equivalent to the factory administrative cadres. Since the higher authorities have this regulation, why can't they enjoy the bonuses when the factory completes or exceeds its production tasks? Furthermore, both the factory cadres and the full-time cadres of the Party, Youth League, and trade union organizations do not directly participate in production. The factory cadres should receive bonuses, so why shouldn't the full-time cadres of the Party, Youth League, and trade union organizations receive bonuses?
    I am a full-time cadre of the Party Committee of Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant. I was transferred from the workshop in October last year. I used to be a fourth-grade worker, with a basic salary of fifty-four yuan per month. I had to get at least fifteen yuan in bonuses every month, often getting around twenty yuan, and sometimes up to thirty yuan or so. Now, if I were still in the workshop producing, I could earn a hundred yuan or so in basic salary and bonuses every month. My apprentice is now producing in the workshop, and he can now earn a hundred yuan or so every month. However, my current salary is only sixty-eight yuan, and the quarterly bonuses are very small. When I was first transferred to be a full-time cadre, I had some ideological fluctuations, but I thought that I was a Communist Party member and should obey the needs of the organization, so I got better later and didn't think about how much the salary and bonuses were. Moreover, I knew that transferring me to be a full-time cadre meant that the organization trusted me. However, I disagree with canceling the bonuses issued to the full-time cadres of the Party, Youth League, and trade union organizations. If that were done, no one would be willing to be a full-time cadre and would only be willing to be a production worker.
    Of course, it is not appropriate for the full-time cadres of Tangshan Steel Plant to receive more bonuses than the production workers. Compared with production workers, full-time cadres should receive less, because if cadres' welfare exceeds that of the masses, the work will not be easy to do, the speech will not be credible, and it may even cause dissatisfaction among the masses. Among the full-time cadres, the cadres of the Party, Youth League, and trade union organizations should receive even less than the administrative cadres.
    Is it okay for the bonuses of the full-time cadres of the Party, Youth League, and trade union organizations to be issued by their direct superiors? I disagree. Because although they are cadres of these organizations, they are also indispensable members of the factory. I think it is reasonable for the factory to issue them.　　Han Baorui

### 企业里哪些奖金不合理？　怎样对待不合理的奖金？

    企业里哪些奖金不合理？　怎样对待不合理的奖金？
    编者按：4月3日本报二版发表了一篇“一个共产党员的额外收入”的文章，报道一个共产党员怎样正确地对待在落后的工时定额下所得到的“额外收入”。这篇文章发表以后，引起了许多读者的兴趣。4月20日本报发表了两封读者来信，李玉生和一鸣两位同志又提出了脱产的党群干部不该得完成生产任务奖和在指标低的情况下超额完成生产任务不该发奖金的问题。这两封来信发表后，又有一些读者提出了不同的意见。据读者反映，目前企业中不合理的奖金和“额外收入”，还不止这一些，对待这些奖金和“额外收入”应当采取什么态度，大家的意见也不一致。因此，希望大家就这个问题继续发表意见。
    问题不在这里
    4月20日人民日报第二版的读者来信，引起了我的兴趣，这个问题确有进一步探讨的必要。
    我认为李玉生、一鸣两同志所批评的奖励问题，是有些道理的；但是，他只看到了问题的一个方面，没有看到问题的另一个方面。我们知道，一个企业单位完成或超额完成生产任务，直接生产的工人固然花了力量，而企业的非生产人员也花费了力量；工厂企业中的每件产品，既包含着一般业务工作人员的劳动，也包含有政治思想工作人员的劳动。因为生产是人推动机器的成果，人又是靠一定的政治觉悟、饱满的工作情绪和旺盛的战斗力去进行生产的。如果没有党和群众组织的政治工作，要顺利地完成预定计划是很难想像的。在特定的意义上说，政治工作是起决定作用的力量。所以，企业既然在完成生产任务以后可以按规定拿到奖金，那么，在具体分配的时候就没有任何理由不给领导人员（其中包括厂长、党委书记在内）以应得的奖金。根据按劳付酬的原则，我认为在企业中适当放宽一些发放奖金的面是应该的，领导人既然出力不小，比一般职工多拿些奖金也是合情合理的。
    自从实行奖励基金以来，我们厂里的党、团、工会干部每次得到了奖金，工作积极性特别提高了，关心全厂生产任务的观念也加强了，如果认为领导干部得奖是“觉悟不高”的表现，那是不公平的。党从来没有否认物质利益的原则，相反，还经常注意到从物质上关心个人的劳动成果。
    所以，问题不在于企业的党和群众组织的专职人员应不应拿奖金，而是有些企业对于落后的劳动定额有没有及时修改。例如北京电业局高压变电所二十四个电站中有十六个是1953年以后新建和改建的，客观上为安全创造了很好的条件，而实行的安全奖励指标仍然是五年前制定的，因此，职工们完成奖励指标不困难，得奖金也就很容易。这就是一个明显的例子。
    所以及时修改落后的定额才是问题的所在。　　　天工
    党群干部可以得奖
    4月20日，人民日报二版上发表了李玉生同志“读了‘一个共产党员的额外收入’以后”的来信，李同志在分析了唐山钢厂党委、青年团、工会的脱产干部和职工群众的得奖情况后，说：“按照以上所说的道理，我认为厂矿企业内党组织及工会、青年团组织的脱产干部都是不应享得工厂的完成生产任务奖金的。”我不同意这种看法。
    工人的生产劳动很紧张，这些脱产干部并不是一天吃了饭闲呆着，他们的劳动也是很紧张的，而且直接影响着生产任务的完成。一个工厂里没有党、团、工会干部的工作，厂的生产任务能完成吗？简直是不可能设想的事情。而且，这些脱产干部在厂里完成生产任务后，进行季度评奖是上级规定的。比方说，我们北京第一机床厂根据上级的原则规定，制定了甲、乙两种季度评奖办法：甲等厂部行政干部得自己工资的38％强，乙等得工资的35.83％；党、团、工会的脱产干部和厂部行政干部相当。既然上级有此规定，那么，他们为什么在工厂完成或超额完成生产任务的时候，不能享得奖金呢？再说，厂部干部和党、团、工会组织的脱产干部都是不直接参加生产的，厂部脱产干部该得，为什么党、团、工会组织的脱产干部不该得呢？
    我是北京第一机床厂党委的脱产干部，是去年10月份由车间调来的。我原来是四级工，基本工资每月五十四元，每月至少要得奖金十五元，经常得二十元左右，多时可达三十元上下。现在，要是我还在车间生产，每月基本工资和奖金能拿百把元；我的徒弟，现在在车间生产，他现在每月都能拿百把元。但是，我现在的工资仅六十八元，季度奖金很少。初调我当脱产干部时，我思想上有过波动，但想到自己是共产党员，应当服从组织的需要，后来也就好了，不去想工资、奖金多少了；而且，我知道，调我当脱产干部，说明组织上信任我。然而，我不同意把发给党、团、工会组织的脱产干部的奖金取消。那样做，谁都不愿意当脱产干部，只愿意当生产工人了。
    当然，像唐山钢厂的脱产干部拿的奖金比生产工人还多，是不应当的。跟生产工人比较起来，脱产干部应当拿得少一些，因为干部福利如果超过了群众，工作就不好作，说话就没本钱，甚至会引起群众不满。在脱产干部中，党、团、工会组织的干部又应比行政干部少拿。
    党、团、工会组织的脱产干部的奖金由他们直属上级发给行吗？我不同意。因为他们虽然是这些组织的干部，但同时也是工厂不可缺少的组成人员。我认为，由工厂发给是合理的。　　韩宝瑞
