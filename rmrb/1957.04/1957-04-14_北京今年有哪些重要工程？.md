Beijing will see the construction of over thirty new and ongoing factory, mine, aviation, and railway transportation hub basic construction projects this year.

These projects include the Beijing Central Airport, the largest and most comprehensively equipped in the country, the Capital Thermal Power Plant with a generating capacity of 200,000 kilowatts, the Capital Hub Station connecting major national railway networks, the Teaching and Scientific Instrument Factory dedicated to manufacturing teaching and practical instruments for schools, the Film Processing Plant with an annual production of 45 million feet of film, the nation's only synthetic fiber – commonly known as nylon – pilot plant, the Jingxi Datai Shaft and Fangshan Horizontal Adit mines dedicated to supplying coal to the people of the Beijing-Tianjin area, as well as the Broadcasting Building, Telegraph Building, and other projects.

Beijing Central Airport will be a World-Class Airport

Beijing Central Airport will be a world-class airport. Once completed, it will be able to accommodate more than 300 take-offs and landings per day. It has extremely solid and high-grade runways, and even the world's largest aircraft can take off and land at this airport. The airport has various new navigation and auxiliary navigation equipment, and its safety equipment is extremely complete. Aircraft can take off and land normally around the clock regardless of the weather. This airport has a large-scale aircraft repair factory that can repair a large number of aircraft and engines.

A terminal building with an area of more than 10,000 square meters will also be built at this airport, which can accommodate more than 3,000 passengers entering and leaving here every day.

At present, the runways, taxiways, aprons, command and control building, and pilot hostels of this airport have been mostly or completely completed. Various electrical equipment, telecommunications equipment, refueling equipment, water supply and drainage systems, and the terminal building will be started in the near future. Now, gardeners are planting trees along the dedicated airport highway to green the airport. If building materials can be supplied on time, the airport can be completed by the end of the year.

The Capital Thermal Power Plant will fully supply electricity to citizens

The staff of the Capital Thermal Power Plant, which is fully aided by the Soviet Union, are actively carrying out various preparations for full-scale construction. The total generating capacity of this thermal power plant is 200,000 kilowatts, and the total amount of electricity can be used by textile factories with about 4 million spindles and 40,000 looms. As long as one-third of its electricity is extracted, the electricity consumption problem of the entire Beijing city residents can be solved. The first phase of the project will start in July this year, and the first 25,000 kilowatt generator can start generating electricity next year. The first phase of the project can be completed and put into production in 1959. By then, 600 million kilowatt-hours of electricity can be supplied to cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan, and Zhangjiakou every year.

Beijing Hub Station Connects Major National Railway Networks

The construction of the Beijing Hub Station, which connects major national railway networks, is currently underway in several places simultaneously. The Beijing Outer Ring Railway is currently under intense design and can be constructed next year. The earthwork of the Fengtai marshalling station hump yard has been completed by more than 80%. More than 120 sets of turnouts have been completed, and 43 kilometers of lines have been completed. One of the two overpasses was completed last year, and the second one can be constructed soon. In order to improve the congestion of Beijing Station, the design of the temporary station building of the new Yongdingmen Station has been completed. The entire project started in December last year. At present, five groups of turnouts have been completed, and more than 300 meters of railway have been laid with rails. Its entire project can be completed within this year. After the new Yongdingmen Station is completed, more than 40% of passengers can enter and exit Beijing from the new station. The reconstruction project of Guang'anmen Station can also start in July this year and is expected to be completed by the end of the year. After the completion of this reconstruction project, it can be used as a freight station instead of Beijing West Station.

Synthetic Fiber Plant will produce Nylon Underwear and Socks

This year, Beijing also has more than 30 new and expansion projects, which will also start construction one after another soon. Near the three cotton textile factories in the eastern suburbs of Beijing, China's first synthetic fiber (commonly known as nylon) pilot plant will be newly built. This factory can produce more than 380 tons of synthetic fiber per year. After the factory is built, people can wear underwear and socks made of domestically produced synthetic fibers. The Teaching and Scientific Instrument Factory constructed by the Ministry of Education can also partially start construction this year. This factory is also designed by Soviet experts. Its production capacity is very large. After all the construction is completed, the scientific instrument products produced for teaching purposes can be exported to schools in the Soviet Far East region in addition to being used by schools in our country. In addition, many projects such as the Telegraph Building and the Broadcasting Building are under construction or will soon start construction. (Attached picture)

    北京今年有哪些重要工程？
    本报讯　北京地区今年有三十多个新建和跨年度的工厂、矿井以及航空、铁路运输港站等基本建设工程施工。
    这些工程中有全国规模最大设备最完善的北京中央机场，有发电能力达二十万瓩的首都热电站，有联结全国各主要铁路网的首都枢纽车站，有专为学校制造教学实习仪器的教学科学仪器厂，还有年产四千五百万尺胶片的电影洗印厂，还有全国唯一的合成纤维——俗称尼龙中间试验厂，还有专为供应京津地区人民烧煤的京西大台立井、房山平洞矿井，以及广播大厦，电报大楼等工程。北京中央机场将是世界第一流的飞机场
    北京中央机场将是世界第一流的飞机场，它的全部工程完成以后，每天可以容纳三百多架次的飞机起降，它有极其坚固的高级跑道，目前世界上最大的大型飞机也可以在这个机场上起飞和降落。这个飞机场拥有各种新式的导航和助航设备，安全设备也极其完善，无论遇到任何气候昼夜二十四小时内飞机都可照常起飞和降落。这个飞机场设有规模巨大的飞机修理厂可以修理大量的飞机和发动机。
    在这个机场上还将建设一座面积一万多平方公尺的航站大楼，每天能供三千多名旅客从这里出进。
    目前这个机场的跑道、滑行道、停机坪、指挥调度大楼、飞行员招待所等工程都已大部或全部完成。机场上的各种电器设备、电讯设备、加油设备、上下水道、航站大楼等工程近日内就可开工，现在园林工人们正沿着机场专用公路植树，为这个机场进行绿化，如果建筑材料能够按时供应，这个机场在年底前就可以完成。首都热电站将充分供应市民用电
    苏联全面援助的首都热电站的职工们正在积极进行全面施工前的各项准备工作。这个热电站总的发电能力是二十万瓩，全部电量约可供给四百万纱锭和四万台织布机的纺织厂使用。只要抽出它的三分之一的电量，就能解决北京全市居民用电的问题。它的第一期工程，今年7月份就可以开工，它的第一台二万五千瓩的发电机明年就可以开始发电，1959年第一期工程可以全部完成，投入生产。到那时候，每年就可以有六亿度的电供给北京、天津、唐山以及张家口等城市使用。北京枢纽站联系全国主要铁路网
    联结全国主要铁路网的北京枢纽站的工程，目前正在数处同时进行。北京外环铁路线目前正在紧张地进行设计，明年就可施工。丰台编组站驼峰厂的工程，目前土方工程已完成80％以上。道叉子已完成一百二十多副，线路已完成四十三公里。两座跨线桥去年已完成了一座，第二座不久就可施工。为了改善北京车站拥挤现象而新建的永定门车站，它的临时站房的设计已经完成，整个工程去年12月份就已动工，目前道叉子已完成五组，有三百多公尺的铁路已铺上了铁轨。它的全部工程今年年内就可完成。永定门新站建成以后，40％以上的旅客就可从新车站进出北京。广安门站的改建工程，今年7月份也可以开工，预计年底可以完成。这个改建工程完成后，就可以代替北京西站的货站使用。合成纤维厂将生产尼龙内衣和袜子
    今年北京另有三十多项新建扩建工程，不久也将陆续开工。在北京东郊三个棉纺织厂附近，将新建我国第一座合成纤维（俗称尼龙）中间试验工厂。这个工厂每年可以生产三百八十多吨合成纤维。这个厂建成以后，人们就可以穿到本国生产的合成纤维制造的内衣和袜子了。教育部建设的教学科学仪器厂，今年也可以部分开工。这个厂也是由苏联专家设计的，它的生产能力很大，全部建成后，生产出来的教学用科学仪器制品，除了我国学校使用以外，还可以出口一部分供给苏联远东地区的学校使用。此外电报大楼、广播大厦等很多工程正在施工或即将开工。（附图片）
