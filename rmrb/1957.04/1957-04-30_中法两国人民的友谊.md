The Friendship Between the Chinese and French People
President of the International Organization of Journalists, Jean Maurice Hermann

People loving each other is, without a doubt, more in line with human nature than hating each other. However, the depth of friendship varies greatly. Some are only slightly above indifference or pure curiosity, while others are built on the harmony of feelings and interests. The friendship between China and France is of the latter kind. When transportation was still extremely difficult, France had already truly come to know Chinese life. This first contact was a case of "love at first sight." For most of the eighteenth century, French pattern decorators had already been creating their patterned artworks (fabrics and furniture) with reference to Chinese themes. Thinkers of that era, preparing for the French Revolution of 1789, constantly sought examples of benevolent governance from China (no doubt some of it was just imagined). They modified these examples to attack the tyranny that ruled France at the time. Since then, in each generation of French people, there have been those who have made the study of the Chinese language and culture their lifelong career. This sympathy and enthusiasm is even higher today because the French people are extremely interested in the great experiences gained in the new social construction that People's China is undertaking.

There are great differences in customs, habits, and practices between our two peoples. Some people even ask: Is it better to drink soup before or after a meal? Is it better to wear white or black when a relative dies? Since the cultures of the two countries have developed independently from each other for centuries, as if on two different planets, this dissimilarity is not surprising. However, what surprises a Frenchman who comes to China for the first time is that there are many similarities between China and France. A Frenchman will quickly feel comfortable in this country. Our two countries are located at opposite ends of a vast continent, which has separated us for a long time. But today, it only takes a day to cross this continent and reconnect us. The character of the Chinese people and the French people is so strangely similar. They equally love serious work, meticulous creations, attention to economy, respect for knowledge and culture, appreciation of art, and loyalty to past achievements while being able to innovate. Their architecture also emphasizes beauty, openness, and attention to practicality and compactness. They eagerly pursue the joys of life. It is no coincidence that the best chefs in the world's most famous hotels and restaurants are often French, if not Chinese. They also prefer to reason, appealing to conscience rather than being swayed by emotions. They also like to joke around and pay attention to physical and mental well-being. They fought together against fascist aggressors for freedom and independence, regardless of whether the target was Hitler's barbarism or its ally, Japanese militarism. They are equally deeply willing to live a peaceful life.

In our country, no one harbors hatred towards China. A Chinese person who comes to France can discover this when meeting French people of different professions and statuses, even those who are not at all connected with progressive ideas. Last month, a member of the National Assembly submitted a proposal requesting the government to restore normal diplomatic relations between China and France. The Assembly's Foreign Affairs Committee unanimously elected this member to draft a report on behalf of the Foreign Affairs Committee. The members of the Foreign Affairs Committee included representatives of all political parties. This action indicated that they all agreed to the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and France. But why has this step not been taken so far? Because government ministers are unwilling to get rid of the pressure from the United States. Do not forget that the United States was the last to recognize the Soviet Union. The Washington government, due to domestic considerations and outdated old plans, continues to implement policies determined by the will of the "China Lobby," whose members are bought off by the dollars that American financial tycoons send to Taipei. American financial tycoons are extremely frustrated by the loss of the opportunity to plunder China's wealth. The current policy implemented by France helps the United States maintain its influence over Taipei. But can this factor really forever stop justice, reason, friendship, and interests? Can it really forever defeat the forces that are emerging within the bourgeoisie that demand to do business with China? The United States, under pressure from entrepreneurs in some of its allies and even its own country, has already taken the first step, agreeing to ease the embargo on China. These contradictions will inevitably force it to make more concessions.

The French and Chinese people can now, more effectively than ever before, work together to strengthen their friendship. This friendship cannot be stopped by any force. Trade between the two countries is beneficial to both.

We in France have excellent technicians, we can manufacture the world's fastest locomotives, we can manufacture automobiles, radio equipment, electrical equipment, airplanes, and machine tools, and we can build the most economical high mountain dams. We can help accelerate the completion of the great undertaking of modernizing the country that People's China is currently engaged in in many ways. Our universities can train a large number of university students for China. If we can contribute some of our advanced experience to China, then can't China also use its own advanced experience in transforming society to help us? We still have to start transforming society, while China has already found such novel and humane ways in this regard. Such an exchange would be of great benefit not only to our two countries but also to all mankind.

The friendship between the Chinese and French people is a fact. This friendship can and should become a historical reality and a factor for peace, overcoming dangerous "bloc" policies, strengthening mutual understanding, cooperation, and mutual respect among the people of the world. This friendship is a vibrant force. We were very honored to receive the actors of the Chinese Peking Opera Troupe and the Chinese representatives at the Paris Exposition. I am convinced that when they come into contact with our people, they will feel this. During my short stay in China, in every handshake, in every conversation, and in the eyes of the excellent younger generation full of infinite confidence in the future, I felt the strength of this friendship. This flower of friendship cannot be stopped by any storm blowing from anywhere from blooming more brightly towards the sunshine of peace.

### 中法两国人民的友谊

    中法两国人民的友谊
    国际新闻工作者协会主席  让·莫里斯·埃尔曼
    人们彼此友爱，比起彼此憎恨来，毫无疑问是更合乎人类天性的。但是，友谊的深浅程度相差很大，有的仅仅比漠不关心或者纯粹好奇高一些，有的却建筑在感情和利害的协调上。中法两国的友谊是后面那种友谊。当交通情况还万分困难的时候，法国已经真正认识了中国的生活。这初次接触是“一见倾心”的。十八世纪大部分时间，法国图案装饰艺术家已经参照中国的题材来创造他们的图案艺术品（布和家具）。那个时代的思想家，为1789年大革命做着准备，不断向中国寻觅仁政的范例
  （没有疑问一部分只是想像的），他们把这些范例改头换面用来抨击当时统治着法国的虐政。从此，每一代法国人中间，都有人把学习中国的语言和文化作为自己的终身事业。这种同情爱好，在今天是更加高涨了。因为，法国人民对人民中国正在进行的新社会建设中取得的伟大经验有着极大的兴趣。
    在我们两国人民之间，人情、风俗和习惯有着很大的差异。有的人甚至问：究竟在进餐前喝汤好还是进餐后喝汤好？死了亲人是穿白的好还是穿黑的好？两国文化既然在好几个世纪中像在两个行星上一样彼此各不相干地发展着，这种互不相似是并不奇怪的。可是，叫一个第一次来中国的法国人更加惊奇的是，中法两国之间有着许多相同点。一个法国人在这个国家里很快就会感到舒适自在。我们两个国家分处在一个辽阔的大陆两端，它好久以来把我们分开着；但是今天只需要一天时间就可以穿越这个大陆，把我们重新联系起来了。中国人民和法国人民的性格是如此奇异地相像。他们同样喜爱认真的工作，细致的作品，注意节约，尊重知识文化，欣赏艺术，忠诚于过去的成就而又能够推陈出新。他们的建筑同样讲究美观、开朗而又注意到实用、紧凑。他们热烈追求生活的情趣。在全世界最著名的旅馆和餐厅里，最好的厨师如果不是中国人，往往是法国人，这绝不是偶然的。他们同样宁愿讲理，求诸良知而反对感情用事。他们同样喜欢开玩笑，注意身心愉快。他们曾一起对法西斯侵略者进行战斗，争取自由独立，不管对象是希特勒野蛮主义还是它的同盟者日本军国主义。他们同样深切地愿意过和平生活。
    在我国，没有人对中国有仇恨心。中国人到了法国，同不同职业、地位的法国人，甚至同与进步思想毫不相干的人相遇，都可以发现这一点。上月有一位国民议会的议员提出要求政府恢复中法两国正常外交关系的提案，议会的外交委员会全体一致推举这位议员代表外交委员会起草报告。外交委员会的成员，包括所有政治党派的代表。这一举动表示他们都同意中法复交。但是这项步骤又为什么至今没有采取呢？由于政府部长们不愿摆脱美国的压力。不要忘记，美国是最后承认苏联的。华盛顿政府由于内政的考虑和早已过时的老计划，继续推行着根据“院外援华集团”的意志决定的政策。“院外援华集团”的这些人，正是由美国金融财阀送给台北的美元所收买的。美国的金融财阀眼睁睁失去掠夺中国财富的机会，不胜懊丧。而法国目前执行的政策，有助于美国对台北的影响。但是，这一因素难道真能永远阻挡得住正义、理性、友情和利益吗？真能永远战胜就在资产阶级内部产生的要求与中国做生意的力量吗？美国在它的某些盟国，甚至它本国的企业家压力下，已经让了第一步，答应放宽对中国的禁运；这些矛盾一定会叫它作出更多的让步。
    法国人民和中国人民比过去任何时期更可以有效地共同努力来加强彼此的友谊。这种友谊是任何力量也阻挡不住的。两国进行贸易对彼此都有好处。
    我们法国有优秀的技术人员，我们能制造全世界速度最高的机车，我们能制造汽车、无线电器材、电力设备、飞机和工作母机，我们能建造最经济的高山大水坝。我们可以在许多方面帮助人民中国目前所进行的使国家现代化的巨大事业提早完成。我们的大学可以替中国造就大批大学生。如果我们能把某些方面的先进经验贡献给中国，那末中国不是也已经可以用它自己改造社会的先进经验来帮助我们吗？我们现在还得着手改造社会，而中国在这方面却已经找到了如此新颖和合乎人情的方式。这样的交换不但对我们两国，而且对全人类都会大有好处。
    中法两国人民的友谊是个事实。这种友谊能够而且应该成为一个历史现实与和平的因素，战胜危险的“集团”政策、加强全世界人民的互相了解、彼此合作和互相尊重。这种友谊是一种生气勃勃的力量。我们很荣幸地接待过中国京剧团演员和巴黎博览会的中国代表。我深信，当他们同我国人民接触时，一定会感到这一点的。在中国逗留的短短的时期内，我在每一次握手中，每一次谈话中，在对未来充满无限信心的优秀的青年一代的眼光中，感到这种友谊的力量。这朵友谊的花是任何地方吹来的狂风也阻止不了它向着和平的阳光开得更绚烂的。
