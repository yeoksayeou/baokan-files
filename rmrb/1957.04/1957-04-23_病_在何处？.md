    Where is the "Illness"?
    Hòu Mìng

    The miscellaneous essay (skit) once experienced a crisis, but that crisis has passed.

    To deny that the miscellaneous essay ever faced a "question of survival" is to go against the reality of its development; however, to describe the specific difficulties encountered in miscellaneous essay creation recently as a "new crisis for skits" – a "crisis of extinction" – is also an exaggeration.

    In the second half of 1956, miscellaneous essays appeared in large numbers. Soon after, they gradually disappeared and became lifeless. By January and February of this year, the miscellaneous essay was gradually heading towards extinction. A literary phenomenon suddenly occurred and then suddenly faced "premature death." Why is this? It is right to say that "although the skit is a product of the democratic revolution and the ideological revolution, as a defender of truth, it should live forever in the battle for truth"; it is also right to say that "the people's need for skits has not diminished from what it was in the past." However, why was the tradition of miscellaneous essays interrupted for several years after liberation? Since it "should live forever in the battle for truth," why did the tradition of miscellaneous essays, which had just been revived last year, face a "premature death" crisis again? There must be a reason.

    The large-scale appearance of miscellaneous essays and satirical works is the need for the development of real life and a new creative requirement for writers who truly dare to boldly face life. As contradictions within the people become increasingly clear, writers not only see the positive, progressive, bright, and beautiful aspects of life but also the negative, backward, dark, and ugly aspects that directly hinder progress. There is of course no problem in dealing with the former; what should be done with the latter? If you close your eyes, you will definitely whitewash life and deceive the readers. Therefore, with the conscience of a revolutionary, the author bravely took up the critical and satirical weapon – the miscellaneous essay – in the face of a new social problem.

    However, the miscellaneous essay was not readily accepted by readers. The term "readers" here refers not only to literature lovers but also to the broad masses of cadres and the people. The miscellaneous essay is a weapon of criticism. The object of criticism in miscellaneous essays is the shortcomings within the people. Before the issue of how to correctly handle contradictions within the people was resolved in theory, a common social mentality existed among the masses. They saw contradictions in life but could not find the correct solution, and therefore were afraid of boldly and publicly exposing them, fearing that this would damage the positive aspects of life. This was how they viewed miscellaneous essays. Although individual miscellaneous essays were welcomed by some readers, as a social mentality, there was fear and unwelcome towards miscellaneous essays, and a discriminatory attitude towards them. As a result, a miscellaneous essay with a relatively sharp ideological content often received dozens or hundreds of opposing opinions, protesting against newspapers and periodicals using miscellaneous essays to expose contradictions within the people, and even questioning the author's motives and stance. The opinions of the vast number of readers made the editors of newspapers and periodicals shrink back, waver, and dare not boldly let go. As a result, writers wrote less, wrote less boldly, and stopped writing. Literary criticism reflecting this social mentality also appeared, fundamentally negating miscellaneous essays and treating them and other satirical works as venting "dissatisfaction and disappointment," or revising the task of miscellaneous essays, allowing them to sing the praises of bright things, otherwise, if there were too many miscellaneous essays, it would make people think that "it seems that our country's work is simply an unimaginable mess (!)." The biggest problem in miscellaneous essay creation lies in the social mentality of opposing it and even demanding its elimination. Therefore, the "question of survival" of miscellaneous essays arose, and they indeed encountered a "crisis of extinction." Because all these opinions did not treat some problems in miscellaneous essays as general problems in the usual way, but first of all rejected them, regarding miscellaneous essays as "evil things." If the issue of how to correctly handle contradictions within the people cannot be resolved, the "crisis of extinction" of miscellaneous essays cannot be saved, and its life may not be extended by a year.

    Chairman Mao made a Marxist exposition on how to correctly handle contradictions within the people at the Supreme State Conference. This is not only a guide for solving other problems, but also fundamentally saved the crisis of miscellaneous essays, and the "question of survival" of miscellaneous essays truly no longer exists. However, the difficulties hindering the development of miscellaneous essays have not been completely eliminated, but their nature has changed. Its relationship with miscellaneous essays is no longer "positive" suppressing "evil," but on the contrary, "evil" has become "positive," and "positive" has become "evil," and the positions have been reversed, and its frightening power is also gone. There are still some specific problems belonging to the miscellaneous essay itself and the writer's problems. However, all of this should be treated as a general problem to be discussed under the premise of admitting and affirming that miscellaneous essays should exist. I think that the most important thing now is still the social mentality of fearing and opposing miscellaneous essays and the contradiction in miscellaneous essay creation, although its nature has changed. To completely solve this contradiction is a long-term process, that is, gradually establishing a social atmosphere of conducting criticism and self-criticism in a very natural way. If this point is not seen, overemphasizing that the solution to the problem is to first "cultivate a few promising authors" is somewhat too optimistic. The reason why some miscellaneous essay writers today do not have the attitude and courage to boldly face reality like Lu Xun is not simply because "Mr. Lu Xun was erudite, while we are superficial," the problem is still the social mentality and social atmosphere.

### “病”在何处？

    “病”在何处？
  　侯命
    杂文（小品文）曾经发生过危机，然而，杂文的危机已经过去了。
    不承认杂文曾经发生过“存废的问题”，是违背了杂文发展的实际；但是，最近再把杂文创作中所遭遇到的具体困难，说成是“小品文的新危机”——“消亡的危机”，也是言过其实。
    1956年的下半年，杂文大量出现了。不久之后，杂文就逐渐消失了，无生气了。到了今年的一月二月间，杂文是逐渐走向了消亡的路。一个文学现象突然发生了，又突然濒于“夭亡”了。这是为什么？说“小品文虽然是萌芽于民主革命和思想革命的产物，但它既是真理的维护者，就应该与真理的战斗永生”，这是对的；说“人民需要小品文也并不减于当年”，这也是对的。但是，解放以后几年来为什么中断了杂文的传统？既然“应该与真理的战斗永生”，为什么去年刚刚恢复了杂文的传统又濒于“夭亡”的危机？其中必有缘故。
    杂文大量出现了，讽刺作品大量出现了，这是现实生活发展的需要，是真正敢于大胆地正视生活的作家的新的创作要求。当人民内部的矛盾越来越暴露得鲜明的时候，作家不仅看到了正面的、进步的、光明的、美好的事物，也看到了直接阻碍进步的反面的、落后的、阴暗的、丑恶的事物。对待前者，当然不发生问题；对待后者怎么办，如果闭起眼睛来，就一定粉饰了生活，欺骗了读者。于是，作者凭着自己革命者的良心，在一个新的社会问题面前，勇敢地拿起了批评性的、讽刺性的武器——杂文。
    但是，杂文并非很顺利的为读者所接受。这里所谓读者，不止是文艺爱好者，而是包括广大的干部、人民群众。杂文是批判的武器。杂文批判的对象是人民内部的缺点。在如何对待人民内部的矛盾的问题没有在理论上解决以前，在群众中存在着一种普遍的社会心理，看到了生活中的矛盾，但找不到正确的解决办法，因而也害怕大胆的公开的揭露它，怕由此而损伤了生活中正面的东西，对待杂文的看法就是如此。尽管个别杂文受到部分读者的欢迎，但是作为一种社会心理，是害怕、是不欢迎杂文的，对杂文抱有歧视的态度。于是一篇思想性比较尖锐的杂文，往往收到几十件、几百件的反对意见，抗议报刊利用杂文的形式揭露人民内部的矛盾，甚至怀疑作者的动机、立场问题。广大读者的意见，使报刊的编辑畏缩了，动摇了，不敢大胆的放手了。于是作家写的少了，写的不大胆了，不写了。于是也出现了反映这种社会心理的文艺批评，从根本上否定杂文，把它和其他讽刺作品看作是发泄“不满和失望”的东西，或者是修正杂文的任务，让它去歌颂光明的事物，否则杂文多了，就会使人看来“好像我们的国家的工作，简直是不可想像的一团糟（？）”。杂文创作中最大的问题，是在于反对它并进而要求消灭它的社会心理。因此，杂文“存废的问题”发生了，杂文的确遭遇到“消亡的危机”。因为这一切意见，都不是以通常的方式，把杂文中的一些问题当作一般性的问题来讨论，而首先是不要的问题，把杂文视为“邪物”。如何正确处理人民内部的矛盾的问题不能得到解决，杂文“消亡的危机”无法挽救，说不定难以延长一年的寿命。
    毛主席在最高国务会议上，对如何正确地处理人民内部的矛盾问题作了马克思主义的论述。这不仅是解决其他问题的指南，而且也从根本上挽救了杂文的危机，杂文“存废的问题”才真正的不存在了。但是，阻碍杂文发展的困难还没有彻底消除，然而已变了性质，它与杂文的关系已经不再是“正”压“邪”，相反的是“邪”成了“正”，“正”成了“邪”，地位换过来了，它吓人的威力也就没有了。属于杂文本身的一些具体问题和作家的问题也还是有的。然而，这一切，都应该在承认肯定杂文应该存在的前提下，当作一般性的问题去讨论。我以为现在最主要的仍然是害怕、反对杂文的社会心理和杂文创作的矛盾，虽然它的性质已经变了。要彻底解决这个矛盾，是长期的，也就是逐渐的树立一种很自然的进行批评和自我批评的社会风气，不看到这一点，过分的强调解决问题的办法是先“造就出几个有出息的作者”，未免过于乐观了一些。现在的一些杂文作者所以没有像鲁迅那样大胆正视现实的态度和勇气，就不单纯是因为“鲁迅先生渊博，而我们则浅薄”，问题还是社会心理、社会风气。
