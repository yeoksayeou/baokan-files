    Demobilized Soldiers Building a Li Ethnic Mountain Village
    Xu Xuezeng
    On the right bank of the Changhua River in the Wuzhi Mountain area of Hainan Island, there is a patch of verdant rice paddies. Surrounded by these rice fields, the nearby dozen or so small mountain villages appear particularly beautiful. This is the garden of the famous Nanliu Township Pioneer Agricultural Production Cooperative. The cooperative achieved a bumper harvest in 1956, with production increasing by 154% compared to 1955, and over 95% of the cooperative's households increased their income.

    Speaking of the achievements of this agricultural production cooperative, people always associate it with the demobilized construction soldiers in the cooperative.

    The Pioneer Agricultural Production Cooperative was a high-level cooperative formed by 209 Li and Miao ethnic farmers during the 1956 Spring Festival. Among the members were a dozen Li ethnic demobilized construction soldiers. They were demobilized at different times, but each returned with the same determination—to transform this backward mountain area into a happy socialist mountain area.

    The ethnic minorities living in these mountain villages used to cultivate fields without plows or harrows, using cattle to trample the soil; they harvested rice without sickles, pulling it by hand; they didn't fertilize, water, or weed their crops. Men were not allowed to harvest rice or transplant seedlings, and women were not allowed to plow fields or carry rice. They had to choose "auspicious days" for sowing, and there were many "taboo days" when they couldn't go to the fields. They also did not have the habit of planting rice, and they called early rice "ghost rice," saying that people would get seriously ill if they ate it. The demobilized soldiers, who had been educated by the Party for many years in the army, returned to their hometowns determined to change this backward situation.

    Wang Guoliang, now the production team leader and secretary of the Communist Youth League branch in the cooperative, started mobilizing people to plant early rice shortly after he was demobilized and returned home in 1952. At the time, everyone was unwilling to plant it, so he organized several demobilized soldiers and young activists in the village to take the lead in planting more than ten mu. The early rice grew very well. When it was time to harvest, the elderly people wouldn't allow the rice to be carried home, fearing it would bring disaster to the village. One day, Wang Guoliang cooked a pot of rice with the early rice, and no one in the village dared to eat it, except for the demobilized soldiers and young people who enjoyed a full meal. The next day, many old people ran over to ask if anyone had died during the night. Seeing that the people who had eaten the early rice were all fine, they quietly went home.

    From then on, people no longer believed that early rice would bring disaster. By 1954, many people in the village had quietly started planting early rice.

    It was also in this year that Wang Minghua, a Communist Party member, returned from the army after being demobilized. He brought back several books on developing agricultural production in mountain areas. In these mountain villages, many people had never seen a book from childhood to old age. Wang Minghua would take out the books to read whenever he had time, and some people were surprised to see this. Wang Minghua promoted the idea that there was experience in building mountain villages in the books and that they should learn from advanced areas. Some people listened, but only nodded with half-belief.

    Shortly after returning home, Wang Minghua was elected as the deputy secretary of the village's Party branch. He knew that to increase production, they had to build water conservancy projects, so he convened a meeting of the Party and Youth League members in the village. Most of the Party and Youth League members were demobilized soldiers, and they all agreed with what he said. Then, they widely promoted the idea to the masses. The villagers agreed readily when they listened, but as soon as they turned around, they went back to the mountains to hunt deer. They believed that working on a canal for a day would yield nothing, whereas hunting a deer in the mountains could be sold for money. Wang Minghua had no choice but to organize a few demobilized soldiers to go to the mountains at night to open a canal. They worked all night, diverting some water to irrigate a nearby field. The next day, they mobilized the villagers to visit. Everyone saw that Wang Minghua had brought the water with little effort and increased their confidence in opening canals and building dams. Some Li ethnic elders secretly told their confidants, "Minghua has traveled far and seen a lot. Digging canals must be beneficial, or he wouldn't be doing it."

    After Wang Minghua mobilized the masses, he led everyone up the mountain. He divided the personnel into several groups, divided the construction site into sections, and assigned them to each group. Each group was assigned a demobilized soldier to carry out propaganda and mobilization work and launch a labor emulation campaign. In this way, everyone's enthusiasm for work was very high, and the canal was dug through and the sluice gates were built in a week, capable of irrigating more than 600 mu of land. By the end of 1954, most of the farmland in their village had been turned into paddy fields. The habit of not planting rice, which had existed for generations, was changed by these Li ethnic demobilized soldiers taking the lead.

    Then, the demobilized soldiers actively organized mutual aid teams in the village, leading the farmers onto the road of mutual assistance and cooperation. They took the lead in transplanting seedlings in the fields, breaking the old rule that "men don't transplant seedlings." The masses did not pay attention to accumulating fertilizer, so the demobilized soldiers also promoted it everywhere, leading everyone to build toilets, dig manure pits, and pile up grass fertilizer. They encountered difficulties again when applying fertilizer. Many people said that the crops grew the same without fertilizer in the past, and that fertilizer would burn the crops. Wang Minghua, Wang Guoliang, and others selected a plot of land to experiment and show the masses. They fertilized half of the field with green manure and cow dung, and left the other half unfertilized. As a result, the seedlings on the fertilized half of the field were strong and the ears of rice were plump. The Li ethnic elders who had initially opposed fertilization the most were speechless when they saw this.

    The various technical reforms carried out by the demobilized soldiers under their leadership created favorable conditions for the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives in these mountain villages.

    After the establishment of the cooperative, many members could not afford to contribute to the production fund, so the demobilized soldiers took out all of their demobilization pay to run the cooperative. In order to continue improving production techniques and reduce the cooperative's expenses, the demobilized soldiers also took the lead in coming up with ideas and manufactured many farm tools for the cooperative. They used wood and scrap iron to imitate and make twenty cultivators, and they also made nineteen threshing machines and forty-eight rice threshing barrels with the help of others. When making the threshing machines, they had no drawings and could not design them themselves, so they sent people to climb mountains and cross ridges to visit and learn from the Grain Bureau, which was forty li away. The first threshing machine they made after the visit had no wind and was not easy to use, so they went to the Grain Bureau again to observe, and the second time they successfully trial-produced it.

    With agricultural cooperation, there was a need for culture. Most of the cooperative members were illiterate. At that time, there was no way to record work points in writing, so they had to use bamboo sticks to record them. After the Party branch studied this issue, Wang Guoliang led the Youth League members to set up a civil school in each village and organized the members to study at night. The demobilized soldiers had a high prestige among the masses. When they called for learning, the masses under the age of 50 came to the school, 40% of whom were women. Wang Guoliang, Wang Dabao, and others served as teachers in the night school. At that time, there was no money to buy lamp oil, so they lit pine branches for lighting. The teachers used their experience in cultural learning in the army in their teaching, and everyone made rapid progress. Now many people know three or four hundred characters, and some can write ordinary letters. Through the night school, they trained twenty-three work point recorders, including six Li ethnic girls. They also trained three reserve accountants, including one woman. The bamboo sticks used for recording work points not long ago have now been replaced by beautiful work point recording books.

    The face of the Pioneer Agricultural Cooperative has been completely changed. In the past year, the cooperative has added five double-wheeled double-share plows, six new-style walking plows, eighty-two cultivators, eleven ox carts, and many other relatively new farm tools. The cooperative has built new threshing rooms, granaries, and so on. More than one hundred female cooperative members in the cooperative have learned to plow the fields, changing the past habit of "women not plowing." Last year, the area planted with early rice was expanded by more than 500 mu, more than 2,000 jin of fertilizer were applied per mu, and each paddy field was cultivated and weeded three times. No one cared about "taboo days" anymore. Many labor models and advanced producers have emerged in the cooperative, and Wang Naxiang, a labor model who recently won the first prize in Guangdong Province, is one of them.

    The Pioneer Agricultural Production Cooperative achieved a bumper harvest in its first year. Last year, the cooperative distributed an average of more than 800 jin of grain to each person, as well as some cash. Except for a few households whose income increased by less than 100 yuan, most households increased their income by 300 or 400 yuan. Now, not only can every family eat three meals of dry rice a day, but many households have surplus grain to sell, and the members have money to buy non-staple foods such as oil, salt, soy sauce, and vegetables. In the past six months, every family in the cooperative has added new clothes, totaling more than 800 pieces, with an average of two new sets of clothes per person. Last winter, many people bought quilts and mosquito nets, and 66 new wool blankets were added, and 44 winter clothes were bought to keep warm. This had never happened before. Many members wore sneakers on their feet and even carried flashlights when walking at night. The girls also bought new skirts.

    The members of this ethnic minority agricultural cooperative at the foot of Wuzhi Mountain have already started spring plowing for 1957 on the right bank of the Changhua River, and everyone is full of confidence that this year's production will increase by another 50% compared to 1956.

    建设黎族山村的复员军人们
    徐学增
    海南岛五指山区的昌化江右岸，有一片油绿的水稻。附近十几个小小的山村，被稻田包围着，显得格外秀丽。这里是著名的南流乡先锋农业生产合作社的花园。这个社1956年获得了大丰收，比1955年增产154％，全社95％以上的农户增加了收入。
    提起这个农业生产合作社的成就，人们总是把它跟社里的复员建设军人们联系到一起。
    先锋农业生产合作社是在1956年春节期间，由当地二百零九户黎族、苗族农民组成的一个高级社，社员中有十几个黎族复员建设军人。他们复员的时间有先有后，但是每个人都是抱着一个同样的决心回来的——将这个落后的山区变为幸福的社会主义山区。
    生活在这些山村的少数民族，过去耕田没有犁耙，用牛踩：割稻没有镰刀，用手拔；种庄稼不施肥、不浇水、不锄草。男人不准割稻、插秧，女人不准犁田、担稻。他们播种要选择“吉日”，还有许多不下田的“忌日”。原来也没有种水稻的习惯。并且称早稻米为“鬼米”。说是人吃了会得重病。在部队里受了党多年教养的复员军人们回到家乡以后，决心改变这种落后的状况。
    现在社里的生产队长、团支部书记王国良，在1952年复员回乡不久，就发动人们种早稻。当时大家都不肯种，他就组织村里的几个复员军人和青年积极分子带头种了十几亩。早稻长得很好。收割的时候，老人们都不让将这些稻谷挑回家，怕给村里惹来祸。有一天，王国良用早稻米做了一锅饭，全村的人都不敢吃，只是他们几个复员军人和年青人饱餐了一顿。第二天，许多老人都跑来打听夜里有没有死人，一看吃了早稻米的人都很好，又悄悄地回家了。
    从此，人们再不相信早稻会惹祸了。到了1954年，村里许多人都不声不响地种起早稻来。
    就是在这一年，共产党员王明华也从部队里复员回来了，他带回来几本关于发展山区农业生产的书。在这些山村里，许多人过去是从小到老看不到书的，王明华有了空就拿出书来看，有的人见了都奇怪。王明华向大家宣传，说书本上有建设山村的经验，要很好地向先进地区学习，有些人听了，也只是半信半疑地点点头。
    王明华回家不久，就被选为村里的党支部副书记。他知道要提高产量就得兴修水利，就召集村里的党、团员开会。党、团员大部分是复员军人，听他一说都表示同意，然后又普遍向群众进行宣传。老乡们听的时候满口应承，但是一转身就又跑到山上打鹿去了。他们认为修一天水渠一无所得，不如到山上打一只鹿回来就可以卖钱。王明华只好组织了几个复员军人晚上跑到山上去开水渠。他们几个人干了一夜，把水引过一些来，就近灌溉了一块田。第二天，他们发动老乡们去参观。大家一看王明华没费多大劲把水引来了，便提高了开渠修坝的信心。有的黎族老人暗地里对知己的人说：“明华走的多，见的广，挖渠一定有好处，不然他也不会干。”
    王明华把群众动员起来了，便带领大家上了山。他把人员分成几个组，把工地切成几段，交给各个组分工包干。每一组分配上一个复员军人，在里面进行宣传鼓动工作，开展劳动竞赛。这样大家干活的情绪很高，一星期时间就挖通了渠道，修上了水闸，能够灌溉六百多亩田。到1954年底，他们全村的耕地大都变成了水田。历来不种水稻的习惯，就这样被这些黎族复员军人带头改变了。
    接着，复员军人们就在村里积极组织互助组，使农民走上了互助合作的道路。他们带头下田插秧，打破了过去“男人不插秧”的旧规。群众不重视积肥，复员军人们也到处宣传，领导大家修厕所、挖粪坑、堆草肥。施肥的时候，他们又遇到了困难。许多人说过去没施肥一样长，施了肥会烧死庄稼。王明华、王国良等人便选择了一块田试验给群众看。他们将这块田的一半施上绿肥和牛粪，另一半什么肥料也不施。结果施肥的这半边田，稻苗粗壮，稻穗肥大。当初最反对施肥的黎族老人，见了也不说话了。
    复员军人们领导大家所进行的种种技术改革，给这些山村成立农业生产合作社创造了有利的条件。
    建社之后，许多社员拿不出生产基金，复员军人就把自己的复员费全部拿出来办社。为了继续改进生产技术，减少社里的开支，复员军人们还带头想办法，给社里制造了许多农具。他们用木头和废铁仿造了二十把中耕器，还在别人的帮助下做了十九架风谷机和四十八个打谷桶。在做风谷机的时候，他们没有图样，自己又设计不出，便派人爬山越岭去四十里外的粮食局参观学习。参观回来做了第一架风谷机没有风，不好用，他们又去粮食局观摩，第二次才试制成功了。
    农业合作化了，随着而来的是需要文化。社员大都不识字，当时没办法用文字记工分，只好使用竹签记工。党支部研究了这个问题之后，王国良便领导青年团员每村办了一个民校，组织社员晚上去学习。复员军人们在群众中威信很高，他们一号召学习，五十岁以内的群众都纷纷到学校来了，其中有40％是妇女。王国良、王打保等人担任了夜校的教员。当时没有钱买灯油，他们就用松枝点起来照明。教员们在教学中运用了部队里文化学习的经验，大家进步很快。现在许多人认识了三、四百字，有的能够写普通信了。通过夜校，他们训练了二十三个记工员，其中有六个黎族姑娘。另外还培养了三个后备会计，里面也有一个女的。不久前记工用的竹签子，现在也改换成一本本漂亮的记工簿了。
    先锋农业社的面貌完全改观了。一年来社里添置了五部双轮双铧犁、六部新式步犁、八十二把中耕器、十一辆牛车，还有许多其他比较新式的农具。社里新建了脱谷房、谷仓等。社里一百多女社员学会了犁田，改变了过去“女不犁”的习惯。去年又扩大了种植早稻的面积五百多亩，每亩施肥二千多斤，每块稻田都进行了三次中耕除草，再也没有人讲究“忌日”了。社里还出现了许多劳动模范和先进生产者，最近获得广东省一等奖的劳动模范王那响，就是其中的一个。
    先锋农业生产合作社建社第一年就获得丰收。去年社里平均每人分到了八百多斤粮，另外还有一部分现金，入社农户除少数户增加收入在百元以下，大部分户增加收入三、四百元。现在不但家家每天都能吃到三餐干饭，而且许多户有余粮出卖，社员们都有钱买油盐酱菜等副食品。半年来，全社家家添新衣，共计买了八百多件，平均每人都有两套新衣服。去年冬天许多人买了被子和蚊帐，光绒毡就新添了六十六床，御寒的冬衣买了四十四件，这是从来没有的事情。许多社员脚上穿上了球鞋，晚上走路手里还拿着手电筒哩。姑娘们也买了新裙子。
    五指山下这个少数民族农业社的社员们，早在昌化江右岸展开了1957年的春耕生产，大家都满怀信心地要使今年的生产比1956年再增产50％。
