    Shangrao Agricultural Cooperatives Publicize Financial Income and Expenditure
    Members' Production Enthusiasm Soars
    (Our Newspaper News) Since mid-February, agricultural cooperatives in Shangrao County, Jiangxi Province, have universally begun to publicize their financial accounts. Currently, one hundred and seventeen cooperatives have completed clearing old accounts, establishing new accounts, and publicizing financial income and expenditure to their members. The members of the cooperatives that have already publicized their accounts are greatly satisfied, and their production enthusiasm has soared. For example, in Zhongtan Agricultural Cooperative in Zhongtan Township, before the accounts were publicized, members suspected the cooperative cadres of corruption and were not enthusiastic about production, wanting to engage in sideline occupations individually. On March 14, after the accounts were publicized, the members had a clear understanding of the cooperative's income and expenditure situation and a better understanding of the cooperative's finances. As a result, they became more enthusiastic about production. On the 16th, despite the rain, the members still braved the weather to harrow the fields.
    The publication of financial accounts by agricultural cooperatives in Shangrao County is being carried out under the unified leadership of the Shangrao County Committee of the Communist Party of China. In February, the County Committee issued instructions to the Party organizations of agricultural cooperatives on strengthening the leadership of the financial work of the agricultural cooperatives. County full-time accounting instructors also divided up the areas, went deep into key areas to help explore experiences, and promoted this work through accounting mutual aid organizations, effectively promoting this work.

    上饶各农业社公开财政收支
    社员生产热情高涨
    本报讯　江西省上饶县各农业社从2月中旬普遍开始公布财务账目，现已有一百一十七个社经过清理老账、建立新账，向社员公布了财政收支情况。已经公布了账目的社，社员大为满意，生产热情更加高涨。如中潭乡中潭农业社在未公布账目以前，社员怀疑社干部贪污，生产不起劲，都想个人单独去搞副业；3月14日公布了账目，社员对社的收支情况一目了然，对社的财政收支有了底，生产也就起劲了。16日虽然下雨，社员们还是冒雨耙田。
    上饶县各农业社公布财务账目，是在中共上饶县委统一领导下进行的。2月间，县委向各农业社党组织发出了关于加强农业社财务工作领导的指示。县专职会计辅导员也分片包干、深入重点，帮助摸索经验，并通过会计互助组织加以推广，有效的推动了这一工作。
