    Ninety-Eight Promising Oil-Bearing Structures
    After more than three years of diligent work by petroleum geological exploration personnel in the vast and desolate Qaidam Basin, ninety-eight promising oil-bearing structures have been identified. This year, the petroleum geological departments conducting exploration in Qaidam will concentrate their efforts on further exploration work on these highly promising discovered structures such as Lenghu, Youquanzi, and Youdunzi.
    In recent years, the Ministry of Geology, the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, and the Academy of Sciences have all deployed significant resources in the basin to carry out reconnaissance, drilling, and research work, confirming that the Qaidam Basin has abundant underground oil reserves. Last year alone, out of twenty-five wells drilled at deep and medium depths in five oil-bearing structures, twenty wells had oil or gas shows. The crude oil produced from Lenghu No. 4 and Youquanzi medium-deep well No. 2 has been proven to be of good quality after chemical testing, and the oil layers are shallow with high pressure, which has been preliminarily confirmed to have industrial production value. This year, a small refinery will be built in each of these two exploration areas, and the equipment has already been shipped from the Northeast.
    In mid-March of this year, the 3276 drilling team of the Youquanzi exploration area, one of the main petroleum exploration areas in Qaidam, discovered a nine-meter-thick oil sand layer at a depth of 2,640 meters, which is the first time it has been discovered in a deep well below 2,000 meters in Qaidam; the 3270 drilling team also continued to discover oil-bearing cores in deep wells, providing valuable information for understanding the underground oil reserves in the basin.

    九十八个有希望的储油构造
    辽阔而荒凉的柴达木盆地，经过石油地质勘探人员三年多来的辛勤劳动，探明了九十八个有希望的储油构造。今年，在柴达木进行勘探的石油地质部门将集中力量在这些已发现的极有希望的冷湖、油泉子、油墩子等构造上进行进一步勘探工作。
    几年来，中央地质部、石油工业部、科学院，都以较大的力量在盆地展开了普查、钻探和研究工作，证实了柴达木盆地地下储有丰富的石油。去年仅在五个储油构造上进行深钻和中深钻的二十五口井中，已有二十口喷出和流出了原油或有浓厚的油气显示。冷湖四号、油泉子中深二井喷出的原油，经过化验证明质量都很好，而且油层浅，压力大，已经初步肯定有工业生产价值。今年将在这两个探区各建一座小型炼油厂，目前，这些设备已从东北起运。
    今年3月中旬，柴达木主要石油探区之一的油泉子探区三二七六钻井队在钻进到二六四○公尺时，又发现了有九公尺厚的油砂，这是在柴达木打过的两千公尺以下的深井中第一次发现；三二七○钻井队也在深井内继续发现了含油的岩芯，为了解盆地地下储油情况提供了有价值的资料。
