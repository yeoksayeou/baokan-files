    When Will There Be a Trade Union?
    Since 1953, Yunnan Province has established a Forestry Industry Bureau. Its grassroots organizations have developed from the original logging stations into the current forestry industry sub-bureaus. The tasks are increasing year by year, and the number of personnel is also increasing year by year. However, the organization of the workers and masses – the Forestry Industry Trade Union – has not been established. Over the past few years, the membership relationships transferred from other units have also been shelved. Workers have requested the establishment of a trade union dozens of times, but the higher authorities have not provided any explanation or response. When the Provincial Trade Union held a representative meeting, the employee representatives of our system only attended as observers.
    Taking the automobile repair shop of our Yunnan Forestry Industry Bureau as an example, because there is no trade union organization, things that should be done by the trade union are handled entirely by the administration. The administration is too busy to cope, creating management chaos and affecting the completion of production tasks. The opinions of workers on welfare cannot be fully reflected, and erroneous ideas cannot be educated. For example, many people are unwilling to work in this factory and have taken long leave, which has caused a lot of losses to the workshop. We think that with a trade union organization, these contradictions could be resolved, and the enthusiasm of the masses could be brought into play. But even the shadow of a trade union does not exist to this day. This problem should not be delayed any longer. Song Guojun

    何时才有工会
    1953年以后，云南省就设立了森林工业局。它的基层组织，由原来的伐木站，发展成现在的森林工业分局了；任务在逐年增大，人员也在逐年增多。但是，职工群众的组织——森林工业工会，一直没有成立。几年来，其它单位转来的会员关系，也被置诸高阁。职工要求成立工会，已经好几十次了，上级没作过任何解释和答复。省工会召开代表大会时，我们系统的职工代表只列席参加。
    拿我们云南森林工业局汽车检修厂来说，由于没有工会组织，应当由工会来做的事情，也由行政上包办了。行政上忙得不可开交，造成管理混乱，影响生产任务的完成。职工对生活福利的意见得不到充分反映，错误的思想得不到教育。例如有不少人不愿在这个厂工作，竟请了长假，使车间的工作受到了不少损失。我们想有了工会组织，这些矛盾就可能得到解决，群众积极性可能发挥出来。可是至今连工会的影子都没有。这个问题不要再拖下去了。　　宋国俊
