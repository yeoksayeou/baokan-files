Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, April 10th: Prime Minister U Nu told reporters on April 9th that the purpose of inviting leaders from China's Yunnan Province and a Yunnan cultural delegation to visit Burma is to enhance friendship between China and Burma.

The Burmese Prime Minister said at a press conference that Yunnan in China is adjacent to Burma, and maintaining good relations with Yunnan is also maintaining good relations with other parts of China. He said that some of these Chinese guests will ride in decorated cars through the streets, performing Chinese music and dance, and some will participate in the Water Festival.

U Nu also said that the Chinese guests will visit Moulmein on Burmese New Year's Day (April 16th), and then visit some cities in the Shan State.

Regarding the border issue, U Nu said that there are still one or two points to be resolved. He is waiting for a letter from Zhou Enlai, and further discussions will be held after receiving this letter.

U Nu said that the scope of the border issue is very broad, and not limited to Pianma, Gulang, and Kangfang. We will inevitably face certain problems when trying to reach an agreement on this issue. The Chinese government will also inevitably face some problems. However, we will soon enter the final stage of negotiations. U Nu also said that he believes that the one or two points to be resolved are not very important for the resolution of the problem.

    吴努谈中缅友谊和边界问题
    新华社仰光10日电　吴努总理4月9日对新闻记者说，邀请中国云南省领导人和云南文化代表团访问缅甸，其目的在于增进中缅两国之间的友谊。
    缅甸总理在一个记者招待会上说，中国的云南同缅甸毗邻，同云南保持良好的关系也就是同中国其他部分保持良好关系。他说，这些中国客人中有些将乘着扎彩的汽车穿过大街，表演中国的音乐舞蹈，还有一些人将在泼水节参加泼水。
    吴努还说，中国客人们将在缅历元旦（4月16日）访问毛淡棉，随后还要访问掸邦的一些城市。
    关于边界问题，吴努说，还有一两点有待解决。他正在等待着周恩来的信件，收到这封信件以后还要进一步商谈。
    吴努说，边界问题的范围很广，并不仅仅限于片马、古浪和岗房。我们在设法就这个问题达成协议的时候，必然会面临某些问题。中国政府也必然会面临一些问题。但是，不久我们就会进到谈判的最后阶段。吴努还说，他认为，有待解决的这一两点对于问题的解决并不是很关紧要的。
