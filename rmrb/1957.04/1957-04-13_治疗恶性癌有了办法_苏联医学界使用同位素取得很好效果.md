    A Way to Treat Malignant Cancer
    Soviet Medical Circles Achieve Good Results Using Isotopes

    (Our newspaper, Moscow, 12th dispatch) Soviet medical circles are achieving increasingly significant results in using radioactive isotopes to treat malignant cancer. Kocherov spoke of this in a report at the All-Union Scientific and Technical Conference. He said: "In the treatment of malignant cancer, radioactive cobalt is generally used, and radioactive gold and iodine are rarely used. The use of isotopes to treat malignant cancer has significantly improved the effectiveness of treatment. There are three main reasons: First, it is now possible to widely use radioactive agents to treat malignant cancer patients, and many medical institutions can obtain radioactive cobalt. Previously, only a few central medical institutions could have natural radium and new thorium. Second, it is now possible to use gamma-ray equipment to obtain strong rays of radioactive cobalt. Long-distance gamma-ray therapy has opened up new avenues for the treatment of malignant cancers inside the patient's body, which were previously completely untreatable with light therapy. Third, if external treatment is no longer possible or ineffective, short-lived isotopes can be placed in the patient's body.

    According to Kocherov, gynecological cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors. 20% to 30% are discovered early, and the cure rate with surgery and light therapy can reach 70%. The cure rate for severe cases is only 10% to 15%. According to materials from the X-ray and Radiology Research Institute, the use of radioactive cobalt to treat cervical cancer in Moscow, Leningrad, and Kiev is very effective, with a cure rate of up to 35% for patients in the third stage. Lung cancer, esophageal cancer, bladder cancer, etc., were previously incurable diseases. Recently, preliminary results have been achieved using the above-mentioned various isotope treatment methods, proving that they can restore patients' ability to work and prolong their lives.

    治疗恶性癌有了办法
    苏联医学界使用同位素取得很好效果
    本报莫斯科12日电　苏联医学界利用放射性同位素来治疗恶性癌取得日益显著的效果。科契洛夫在全苏科学技术会议上所作的报告中谈到这一点。他说：“在治疗恶性癌时，普遍利用放射性钴，极少利用放射性金和碘。利用同位素治疗恶性癌显著地改进了治疗的效果。基本原因有三：第一，现在已经有可能广泛利用放射性的药剂来治疗恶性癌病者，许多医疗机关可以得到放射性钴。而以前仅仅几个中央医疗机关才能有天然的镭和新钍。第二，现在有可能利用丙射线设备来取得放射性钴的强烈射线。远距离丙射线治疗法为治疗病人身体内部恶性癌开辟了新的途径，以前这种病是完全不能采用光疗的。第三，如果外部治疗已经不可能或者无效的话，可以把短促存在的同位素放到病人身体中去。
    据科契洛夫说，妇科癌是最常有的一种恶性瘤。20％到30％发现得早，采用外科手术和光疗方法治愈率可达70％。重症治愈率不过10％到15％。据X光和放射学研究所材料，莫斯科、列宁格勒、基辅三地用放射性钴治疗子宫颈癌很有效，第三期病人治愈率可达35％。肺癌、食道癌、膀胱癌等等，过去都是不治之症，最近采用上述同位素各种治疗方法，都已取得初步效果，证明可以恢复病人的劳动力和延长他们的寿命。
