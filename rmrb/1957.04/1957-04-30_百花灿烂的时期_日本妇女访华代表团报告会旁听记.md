"A Period of Blooming Flowers"
    -- Notes from Attending the Report Meeting of the Japanese Women's Delegation to China
    Pei Da

    Yesterday morning, the conference hall of the Beijing Peace Hotel was filled with a joyful atmosphere as the guests of the Japanese Women's Delegation to China introduced the situation of the women's movement in Japan to representatives of women from all walks of life in Beijing. As Madam Kubushiro Ochimi, the 75-year-old leader of the delegation, said so well, they brought the hearts of women from all over Japan. The "China Women's News" responded with warm applause.

    The Japanese women representatives came from all over Japan. Some were from Hiroshima and Nagasaki. These two place names are known to all in China, young and old. The people there suffered the greatest misfortune in human history, and the mothers there persisted in surviving and nurturing a new generation. Their calls for peace received the support and sympathy of Chinese women. There were also representatives from the U.S. Air Force bases – Komaki, Itazuke, and Sunagawa. The heroic Sunagawa broke the dream of the U.S. military to expand its base, repelling the attacks of thousands of police officers. A photo appeared in Chinese newspapers showing the heroic posture of Sunagawa women and children wearing "die-hard" headbands, leaving a deep impression on Chinese women.

    The thirty Japanese women representatives are all activists in the Japanese women's movement. Women from all walks of life in Beijing were happy for their achievements and warmly applauded them – offering feelings of gratitude and respect.

    The speeches of six Japanese women representatives gave Chinese women a deeper understanding of the Japanese women's movement. One representative called the post-war Japanese women's movement "a period of blooming flowers."

    After the war, Japanese women waged a tenacious struggle against the millennia-old patriarchal system and won the right to participate in politics. Public prostitution, which had existed for four hundred years, was abolished by government decree. Japanese female workers and farmers organized themselves. The female workers of the Omi Kenshi textile company persisted in a half-year strike to oppose slave-like labor. To defend peace, they formed mothers' congresses, and 200,000 women are carrying out organized struggles.

    But regrettably, the abolition of the patriarchal system, the prohibition of prostitution, equal pay for equal work... stipulated in Japanese law have not been thoroughly implemented. The wages of female workers are still less than half of those of male workers. There are about five million female workers, but only 10% of those who are married can continue to work. The patriarchal system is reviving, and disguised prostitution is still prevalent everywhere. In addition, there are 280,000 people suffering from atomic diseases, constantly threatened by death. Women want to live a good life, businessmen want to make money, and the government is working with businessmen to deal with them.

    They loudly called for: the thorough implementation of legal regulations, clean politics, and peace!

    They asked for the sympathy and assistance of Chinese women, and the entire audience responded with warm applause. In the singing of "Tokyo-Beijing," Beijing women representatives presented bright flower baskets. Beautiful flowers symbolize the good wishes of Chinese women: may there be world peace, Sino-Japanese friendship, and children's happiness! We wish the Japanese women's movement new successes!

    “百花灿烂的时期”
    ——日本妇女访华代表团报告会旁听记
    裴达
    昨天上午，北京和平宾馆的会议厅里喜气洋洋，日本妇女访华代表团的客人们，向北京各界妇女代表们介绍日本的妇女运动情况。代表团团长、七十五岁高龄的久布白落实老妈妈说得好，她们带来了日本全国妇女的心。中国妇女报以热烈的掌声。
    日本妇女代表来自日本全国各地。有的来自广岛和长崎。这两个地名，在中国是妇孺皆知的。那里的人民遭受过人类历史上最大的不幸，而那里的母亲们坚持着活下来，培育了新生的一代。她们的和平呼吁，得到了中国妇女的支持和同情。还有的代表来自美国空军基地——小牧、板付和砂川町。英雄的砂川打破了美军扩充基地的美梦，击退了几千名警察的进攻。在中国报纸上出现过一张照片，扎着“决死”头巾的砂川妇女和儿童的英雄姿态，给中国妇女留下了深刻的印象。
    三十名日本妇女代表，都是日本的妇女运动的活动家。北京各界妇女为她们的成绩而高兴，向她们热烈鼓掌——献上了感谢和尊敬的心情。
    六名日本妇女代表的发言，使中国妇女对日本妇女运动有了更深的了解。一位代表把战后日本妇女运动称作“百花灿烂的时期”。
    战后，日本妇女向千年的家长制进行顽强的斗争，获得了参政权。四百年前出现的公娼，由政府法令予以废止。日本女工、农妇组织起来了。近江绢丝纺织公司的女工，为反对奴隶式的劳动，坚持了半年的罢工。为保卫和平，她们组成了母亲大会，二十万妇女进行着有组织的斗争。
    但是很遗憾，日本法律上规定的废除家长制，禁止卖淫，男女同工同酬……，还没有彻底执行。女工的工资还不到男工工资的一半。女工约有五百万，而结了婚还能继续作工的只有10％。家长制在复活，变相卖淫仍在到处流行。此外，还有二十八万患原子病的人，时刻受着生命的威胁。妇女们要过好生活，商人要赚钱，而政府又和商人一起对付她们。
    她们大声疾呼：要彻底执行法律规定，要廉洁的政治，要和平！
    她们要求中国妇女的同情和援助，全体听众报以热烈的掌声。在“东京—北京”的歌声中，北京妇女代表献上鲜艳的花篮。美丽的花象征着中国妇女的美好的心愿：愿世界和平，中日友好，儿童幸福！预祝日本妇女运动取得新的成功！
