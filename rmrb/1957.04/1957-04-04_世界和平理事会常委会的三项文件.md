The Standing Committee of the World Peace Council's Three Documents

To All People of the World: An Appeal

Nuclear tests are currently being conducted. These explosions are scattering Strontium-90 into the air, contaminating the land and water. This contamination can cause cancer and leukemia. If these tests continue, they will damage human health for generations and threaten the lives of men, women, and especially children.

Atomic war would certainly annihilate millions of people and turn several continents into ruins. No country, no people want such a war. However, some are openly preparing for such a war. The view that this is inevitable is growing.

The United States and the Soviet Union are continuing to conduct hydrogen bomb tests. Britain will now also conduct such tests.

We demand an end to these tests. We demand an agreement to immediately cease testing.

In this way, we can save the lives of our children. This will prompt governments to agree to destroy atomic weapons and eliminate war itself. If the people of all countries speak out loudly, this call will be heeded. We can still avoid danger.

Statement on the Berlin Appeal of the World Peace Council

Seven years ago, the peace movement, with the Stockholm Declaration, alerted the world to the danger that atomic weapons posed to the people of all countries. Since then, the danger has further expanded.

The serious events at the end of last year pointed out that hotbeds of conflict exist and could at any time lead to a world war involving the use of nuclear weapons.

But today, not only war threatens humanity, but also the tests conducted in peacetime. If the nuclear explosions in the tests carried out by the three major powers continue, they will bring illness or death to millions of people.

The Japanese people, who suffered the most from atomic war and atomic weapon tests, set an example for the people of the world demanding a halt to these tests. This demand has been supported by the highest scientific and moral authorities of the country, and it has been unanimously adopted in the Japanese Parliament.

Governments of countries that have not participated in military treaties, such as India and Sweden, have also made demands to stop testing. Governments and parliaments in other countries have also taken similar steps. Numerous organizations in countless countries have put forward the same demand. The peace movement calls on everyone to support all such initiatives.

We hand this appeal to everyone and call on them to promote it, sign it, or in any other way to secure the approval of the largest number of people in the world.

Resolution of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council on the International Situation

The people of all countries have made many efforts to ease tensions and have felt the positive effects of this easing. However, after this period of relaxation, today the people of all countries are once again facing new divisions and armed conflicts. These divisions and conflicts are reviving the Cold War, intensifying distrust, and potentially creating a situation that poses the greatest danger to world peace.

The world remains divided into various blocs, and military bases have been established on all continents. There are frequent new atomic and nuclear weapon test explosions, and armies are being equipped with atomic weapons. Attempts are being made by all means to prevent countries, primarily in Asia, Africa, and South America, from exercising national sovereignty. All of these increase the danger threatening humanity.

Attempts are being made to coerce the implementation of measures aimed at interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and infringing on the independence of other countries by re-igniting the threat of military action in the Near East. This would make the peaceful resolution of these issues impossible and create a developing hotbed of war in this region of the world.

The Algerian War has been going on for three years. As a result, the situation in the entire North Africa is extremely tense.

The division of Germany, the re-militarization of West Germany, and the equipment of the (West German) Federal Defense Forces with atomic weapons within the framework of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have created a dangerous situation in the heart of Europe. These dangers can be eliminated through the withdrawal of all occupying forces and the conclusion of agreements by the major powers that would lead to the withdrawal of both parts of Germany from military blocs. However, these dangers are further aggravated by the establishment of various "European" institutions, because the establishment of these institutions deepens the division of Europe and allows West Germany to manufacture atomic weapons.

In the past few years, it has shown that world opinion can decisively influence the development of events. The premise is that the people of all countries should maintain and further develop the Geneva spirit and the Bandung spirit, support the world peace movement, and demand that all disputes be resolved through negotiations.

As long as the people of all countries work hard, they can create a new atmosphere of trust and reach agreements on the path of universal security, disarmament, and economic and scientific cooperation.

Anyone who wants to protect all of humanity from regression and destruction has a responsibility to participate in these efforts and assist the great movement launched by the World Peace Council against atomic and hydrogen bomb tests to succeed.

In accordance with the wishes and hopes of the millions of people who are fighting against the threat of war and for peace, the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council has decided to convene a plenary meeting of the World Peace Council in Colombo from June 10 to 16, 1957.

    世界和平理事会常委会的三项文件
    对全世界的呼吁书
    爆炸试验现在正在举行，爆炸使锶九十散布到空中，染污了陆地和水面。这种污染的情况能够造成癌症和白血病。这种试验要是继续下去，将会在几代的时期中损害人体的健康，并且威胁男人、女人、特别是儿童的生命。
    原子战争一定会消灭千百万人民，并且使若干大陆变成废墟。任何国家，任何人民都不要这样一种战争。但是，有人却在公开准备这种战争。认为这是无可避免的看法在日益增长。
    美国和苏联在继续举行氢弹试验。英国现在也将举行这种试验。
    我们要求停止这种试验。我们要求达成立即停止试验的协定。
    这样，我们就能够拯救我们的儿童的生命。这将会促使各国政府同意销毁原子武器并且消除战争本身。如果各国人民大声疾呼，这种呼声就会受到注意。我们仍然能够避免危险。

    关于世界和平理事会柏林呼吁书的声明
    七年前，和平运动以斯德哥尔摩宣言唤起了全世界注意原子武器给各国人民带来的危险。从那时以来，危险更加扩大了。
    去年年末的严重事件指出：冲突的温床是存在的，并且可能随时导致使用核子武器的世界战争。
    但是，今天不只是战争威胁着人类，而且在和平时期所进行的试验也威胁着人类。三个大国在试验中的核子爆炸如果继续进行下去，就将为千百万人带来疾病或者死亡。
    首先在原子战争和原子武器试验中身受其害的日本人民，给世界上要求停止这种试验的人民提供了一个榜样。这种要求得到了这个国家的最高科学和道义权威人士的支持，它在日本议会中获得了一致通过。
    像印度和瑞典这样没有参加军事条约的国家的政府也提出了停止试验的要求。还有其他国家的政府和议会也采取了类似的步骤。无数国家的众多组织都提出了同样的要求。和平运动号召大家支持所有这一类的倡议。
    我们把这一呼吁书交给一切人并且号召他们就这一呼吁书进行宣传、签名或以任何其他的方式来使世界各国最多数的人赞同它。

    1957年4月2日
  　柏林世界和平理事会常务委员会关于国际局势的决议
    各国人民曾经为缓和紧张局势作了许多努力，并且已经感到这种缓和的良好影响。但是，经过了这一段缓和时期以后，今天各国人民又面临着新的分歧和武装冲突。这种分歧和冲突正在使冷战复燃、不信任加强和可能造成一个使世界和平遭到最大危险的形势。
    世界仍然分裂成各种集团，在各大洲都建立了军事基地。经常有着新的原子武器和核武器的试验爆炸，军队正在配备原子武器。有人企图以一切手段阻止首先是亚洲、非洲和南美国家行使民族主权。所有这些都增加了威胁到人类的危险。
    有人企图以重新挑起近东军事行动的威胁来强制推行一种旨在干涉其他国家内政和侵犯其他国家独立的措施。这样就会使这些问题的和平解决成为不可能，并且在世界这一地区造成一个正在发展的战争温床。
    阿尔及利亚战争已经进行了三年。因此，使得整个北非的形势极度紧张。
    德国的分裂、西德的重新军国主义化和（西德）联邦国防军在北大西洋公约组织范围内装备原子武器为欧洲心脏地区造成了危险的形势。这些危险可以通过全部占领军撤退和各大国缔结促使德国的两个部分退出军事集团的协定而消除。但是，由于各种“欧洲”机构的成立，却使得这些危险更为加剧，因为这些机构的成立加深了欧洲的分裂，并且容许西德制造原子武器。
    在过去几年中表明，世界舆论能够决定性地影响事件的发展。其前提是：各国人民应该保持和进一步发展日内瓦精神和万隆精神，支持世界和平运动，要求通过谈判的途径解决一切争端。
    只要各国人民努力，他们就能够造成新的信任气氛和在普遍安全、裁军、经济和科学合作的道路上达成协议。
    谁要保卫全人类免于退步和毁灭，谁就有责任参加这些努力和协助世界和平理事会为反对原子弹和氢弹试验而发起的伟大运动获得成功。
    世界和平理事会常务委员会依照反对战争威胁和为和平而进行斗争的千百万人的愿望和希望决定，在1957年6月10日到16日在科伦坡召开世界和平理事会全体会议。
