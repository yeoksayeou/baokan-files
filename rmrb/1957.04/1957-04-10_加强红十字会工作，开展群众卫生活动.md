Strengthening the Work of the Red Cross Society and Carrying Out Mass Health Campaigns
Wu Yunfu, Vice Minister of Health, Standing Director of the Chinese Red Cross Society

    Comprehensively implementing the principles of "prevention first" and "integrating health work with mass movements" are the basic guidelines for our country's health work. To fully implement the principle of "prevention first," it is necessary not only to have unified planning and leadership from the health departments but also to have the broad masses consciously and willingly participate. It requires not only the guidance of advanced science and technology but also simple and easy-to-implement preventive measures involving the masses. It means not only improving environmental sanitation, eliminating disease-carrying pests, and eradicating all external causes of disease but also improving living environments, emphasizing personal hygiene, possessing strong physiques, and having the ability to resist disease. It means not only resolving pressing issues such as current epidemic diseases but also constantly conducting health knowledge propaganda and education among the masses, cultivating good hygienic habits, and raising the level of health knowledge among the people. Clearly, to implement the principle of "prevention first," it is necessary to simultaneously implement the principle of "integrating health work with mass movements." Otherwise, it will be difficult to achieve the goal of preventing disease. In this regard, I believe that utilizing the Chinese Red Cross Society to assist government health departments in carrying out mass health campaigns is appropriate.
    The Chinese Red Cross Society is a mass-organized, voluntary health and first-aid group. Its main task is to mobilize and organize the masses to learn health knowledge, participate in patriotic health campaigns, and fight to prevent disease and protect physical health. Based on the revolutionary humanitarian spirit of friendship, mutual assistance, and rescuing the dying and healing the wounded, it also participates in social service activities. There are currently seventeen provincial-level (including autonomous regions and municipalities) Red Cross Societies and preparatory organizations, one hundred and thirty-six county and city Red Cross Societies, approximately four thousand grassroots Red Cross organizations, and about seven thousand three hundred Red Cross health stations nationwide.
    In the past two years, Red Cross members and Red Cross health workers have actively participated in mass health campaigns and have conducted health knowledge education and first-aid skills training for the masses. Due to the mutual supervision and inspection by member organizations, a habit of paying attention to hygiene can generally be cultivated among members and health workers. They first improve their personal hygiene and family hygiene, and then influence and help the surrounding masses to carry out health activities. They have proactively and enthusiastically worked in patriotic health campaigns, in popularizing health knowledge, in the struggle to prevent and eliminate diseases, and in emergency situations where people have suffered accidental injuries. They are, in effect, a "militia" force that has received basic training to fight against disease and suffering. In Kaifeng City last year, out of the two hundred and eighty-three individuals selected as models for the patriotic health campaign and the elimination of the "Four Pests", Red Cross members and health workers accounted for 85%. During the rat-catching campaign in Tianjin last winter, Red Cross members and health workers from various districts actively organized rat-catching teams, going into streets and households to inspect rat holes, investigate rat activity, and publicize rat-catching methods to the masses, helping them to find ways to catch rats. These activities broadly mobilized the enthusiasm of the masses to participate in the movement and became a force driving the movement forward.
    Red Cross members and health workers come from the masses and live among the broad masses. They are very familiar with the language, living habits, and health conditions of the people around them. Organizing them to conduct health propaganda can not only reach every household but also easily connect to reality, easily move people's hearts, and therefore be easily accepted by the masses. In Nanjing City's Baixia District, Red Cross health workers in Longwangmiao often talk about health knowledge to the masses while washing rice, washing vegetables, and chatting in the cool, connecting the actual situations of different families, which people are very willing to listen to. Continuing to do this over time can gradually improve the health culture level of the masses, making attention to hygiene a part of their lives and consciously paying attention to health. Health workers from the eight Red Cross health stations in Qiao Township, Anyang City, used methods such as speaking during field breaks and chatting on the kang to educate commune members on how to prevent coal gas poisoning. 80% of the commune members in the entire township installed ventilation devices, and no coal gas poisoning accidents occurred throughout the winter.
    Organizing Red Cross members and health workers to participate in epidemic prevention activities has also played a significant role. Because they are closest to the masses, they can quickly detect and report outbreaks, and they can also assist medical institutions in isolation, disinfection, and nursing work. When measles and scarlet fever were prevalent in Tianjin last winter, the Red Cross organization of Xing'an Road Street in Heping District immediately taught its members knowledge of how to distinguish between these two infectious diseases. A system of household responsibility was implemented among the members to establish an epidemic reporting network, and epidemic liaisons were set up. For example, when the child of the Pang family at No. 1 Jiqing Lane became ill, a member immediately recognized it as measles and quickly reported it to the outpatient department, where timely treatment was given. Isolation measures were also taken in the Pang family, and preventive publicity was conducted to the residents of the same courtyard. As a result, the Pang family's child recovered quickly, and none of the children in the same courtyard were infected. Because the Red Cross organization's role was utilized on Xing'an Road Street, fewer outbreaks occurred, and the measles incidence rate was only 11% among children who had not had measles. All discovered sick children were also reported to the outpatient department without exception, where timely treatment and prevention were carried out, and no sick children died. From these situations, it can be understood that when the masses understand the principles and methods of hygiene, and they are organized to lead the masses in carrying out various health activities, it will make health work gradually become a conscious and voluntary action of the masses, taking root among the people.
    Grassroots Red Cross organizations, members, and health workers are also playing an active role in directly assisting the work of grassroots medical and epidemic prevention institutions. The Dongbuyaqiao Outpatient Department in Beijing is responsible for the medical and prevention work of two streets. In the past, when administering vaccinations, due to insufficient manpower, the process was lengthy, the vaccination rate was low, and the medical staff at the outpatient department were overburdened. Since the outpatient department linked up with the Red Cross organizations of these two streets, doctors were only responsible for physical examinations and technical guidance when performing vaccination tasks. All other work, such as publicity and mobilization, disinfection, injection, and filling out cards, was entirely the responsibility of members and health workers. Last year, when administering encephalitis vaccinations, four vaccination stations were set up in one area, and the task was completed within two and a half days (a total of about six or seven hours), which not only facilitated the masses but also reduced the burden on medical personnel. As for other tasks such as disease source investigation, epidemic area disinfection, physical examinations, and various mass health works, grassroots Red Cross organizations can assist medical and epidemic prevention institutions, becoming the eyes, ears, hands, and feet of these institutions. This can make the work done well, quickly, and economically, and allow medical and epidemic prevention institutions to free up their hands to do more medical, preventive, and technical guidance work that benefits the health of the people.
    The Red Cross organization also has a special role in its activities: it conducts revolutionary humanitarian propaganda and education for its members and health workers, educating them to care about the suffering of the people, to set an example in leading neighbors and friends to pay attention to hygiene and humanitarianism, and to promote the revolutionary humanitarian spirit of mutual assistance, friendship, and rescuing the dying and healing the wounded among the people. This role is particularly prominent in its first-aid activities. In Wuxi City last year, a fisherman's child suffered a cut more than two inches long on his head, exposing the skull, and the situation was very urgent. Shen Xiangxiu, a Red Cross health worker (student) from the Second Middle School, rushed to provide first-aid treatment upon hearing the news and escorted the child to the hospital for further suturing treatment. At the same time, in order to help the fisherman overcome temporary financial difficulties, Shen Xiangxiu also gave her newly received two yuan student aid to her for treatment expenses. The fisherman shed tears of gratitude at the time, and the surrounding masses expressed respect for Shen Xiangxiu's spirit, deeply feeling the nobility and glory of the Red Cross activities. In the summer of the same year, the child of a member of an agricultural cooperative in the suburbs of Qingdao suddenly fell ill at night, losing consciousness. The family was desperate and did not know what to do. Liu Xiuying, the Red Cross health worker in the cooperative, rushed to the scene upon hearing the news, gave the sick child emergency care measures, and immediately groped in the dark to help call a doctor and buy medicine. She also accompanied the sick child's grandmother to guard him all night and provided cold compress care according to the doctor's instructions until the child's condition improved at dawn before returning home. These are just two randomly selected examples. There are many such examples of Red Cross members and health workers in first-aid activities. Many of them are not afraid of hardship, do not want rewards, and selflessly serve the injured and sick, regardless of day or night, wind or rain. Some of their deeds are truly commendable. This is a new moral force demonstrated through the Red Cross Society activities under the socialist system and is also an inexhaustible force in grassroots Red Cross organizations.
    As mentioned above, it is clear that the Red Cross Society can be used as a bridge for government health departments to connect with the masses and as an assistant in carrying out mass health work. Currently, strengthening the work of the Red Cross Society and developing Red Cross Society organizations is conducive to implementing the principles of "prevention first" and "integrating health work with mass movements." Considering it from the perspective of streamlining and saving, strengthening the work of the Red Cross Society also has advantages. Because in the current situation, it is impossible for the state to fully fund the mass health cause. If the Red Cross Society organizational form is used, it is possible to spend less money, do more things, and even do things without spending money. The power of the masses is great. Our health cause is for the masses and must rely on the masses.
    In short, the Red Cross Society is a people's organization that promotes hygiene and humanitarianism and is a force in our country's struggle against disease and suffering. All its activities serve the health of the people, the cause of socialist construction, and the progress and civilization of mankind. This is a people's health and welfare cause. All its activities require the active participation of the broad masses and the attention and support of all sectors of society.

    加强红十字会工作，开展群众卫生活动
    卫生部副部长中国红十字会常务理事  伍云甫
    全面贯彻预防为主和卫生工作与群众运动相结合是我国卫生工作的基本方针。全面贯彻预防为主的方针，不仅要有卫生部门统一计划和领导，还要有广大群众自觉自愿地来参加；不仅要有高级的科学技术的指导，还要有群众性的简单易行的预防措施；不仅要搞好环境卫生，消灭病媒虫兽，消除一切导致疾病的外因，还要人们改善生活环境，讲究个人卫生，有强壮的体质，有抵抗疾病的能力；不仅要解决目前急待解决的流行疾病等问题，还要经常向群众进行卫生知识的宣传和教育，培养良好的卫生习惯，提高人民群众的卫生知识水平。很明显，要贯彻预防为主的方针，就必须同时贯彻卫生工作和群众运动相结合的方针。不然，就很难达到预防疾病的目的。在这方面，我认为利用中国红十字会组织来协助政府卫生部门开展群众卫生运动是适宜的。
    中国红十字会是群众自愿组织的卫生救护团体。它的主要任务是动员和组织群众学习卫生知识，参加爱国卫生运动，为预防疾病、保护身体健康而斗争；并根据友爱互助、救死扶伤的革命人道主义精神，参加社会服务活动。全国现有省、自治区、直辖市红十字会和筹备组织十七个，县、市红十字会一百三十六个，红十字基层组织约四千个，红十字卫生站约七千三百个。
    近两年来，红十字会员和红十字卫生员，积极参加了群众卫生活动，并对群众进行了卫生知识的教育和救护技术的训练。由于会员组织的互相督促和检查，一般能在会员和卫生员中养成讲究卫生的风气。他们首先搞好个人卫生和家庭卫生，再影响和帮助周围的群众进行卫生活动。他们在爱国卫生运动中，在普及卫生知识的宣传教育中，在防疫和消灭疾病的斗争中，在人们发生了意外伤害痛苦的紧急情况中，都主动热情地进行工作。他们实际上是对疾病痛苦作斗争的一支受过初级训练的“民兵”队伍。开封市去年全市评选爱国卫生运动和除四害个人模范二百八十三名，红十字会员和卫生员就占85％。天津市去年冬季开展捕鼠活动时，全市各区红十字会员、卫生员纷纷组织了捕鼠队伍，深入各街各户查鼠洞、摸鼠情，向群众宣传捕鼠的方法，帮助群众想办法捉老鼠。这些活动广泛地鼓动了群众参加运动的积极性，成为推动运动的一支力量。
    红十字会员、卫生员是从群众中来的，他们又生活在广大群众之中，他们非常熟悉周围群众的语言、生活习惯和卫生状况；组织他们进行卫生宣传，不但可以深入到每家每户，而且宣传起来容易结合实际，容易打动人心，也就容易为群众所接受。南京市白下区龙王庙的红十字卫生员常常在淘米洗菜、乘凉聊天的时候向群众讲卫生常识，张家长李家短地联系实际谈起来，人们很乐意听。这样天长日久地做下去，就能够无形中逐步提高群众的卫生文化水平，把讲究卫生作为自己生活的一部分，自觉地注意卫生。安阳市桥乡的八个红十字卫生站的卫生员就是用田间休息、炕头说家常等方式向社员们宣传了怎样预防煤气中毒，全乡80％的社员都安装了风斗，一冬都没有发生过煤气中毒的事故。
    组织红十字会员、卫生员参加防疫活动，也起了不少作用。因为他们最接近群众，发现疫情快、能及时报告疫情，而且还能协助医疗机构作好隔离、消毒和护理等工作。天津市去年冬季麻疹、猩红热流行的时候，和平区兴安路街的红十字组织马上教给会员们辨别这两种传染病的知识，在会员中实行分户负责的办法建立了疫情报告网，设了疫情联络员，如吉庆巷一号庞家的孩子刚得了病，会员马上就认出是麻疹，迅速地报到门诊部，作了及时的治疗，并帮助庞家作了隔离措施，向同院住户作了预防的宣传；这样庞家孩子很快就好了，同院的孩子没有一个受到传染；兴安路街由于发挥了红十字组织的作用，疫情发生得少，麻疹发病率只占未得过麻疹孩子的11％，发现的病儿也一个不漏地报到了门诊部，作了及时的治疗和预防，病儿没有死亡。从这些情况中，可以了解到，当群众懂得讲卫生的道理和方法以后，又组织他们去带动群众开展各项卫生活动，就会使卫生工作逐渐成为群众的自觉自愿的行动，而在群众中生根。
    基层红十字组织的会员、卫生员，在直接协助基层医疗防疫机构的工作方面，也起着积极作用。北京市东不压桥门诊部，负责两个街道的医防工作，过去作预防注射时，由于人力不足，时间长，注射率低，门诊医务人员负担重。自从该门诊部同这两个街的红十字组织在工作上挂上钩以后，在执行注射任务时，大夫只负责体格检查和技术指导，其他宣传动员、消毒、注射、填写卡片等一系列的工作完全由会员、卫生员负责。去年作脑炎注射时，一个地段设四个注射站，在两个半天之内（合计约六、七小时）就完成任务，既便利了群众，也减轻了医务人员的负担。至于其他的病源调查、疫地消毒、体格检查以及各种各样的群众卫生工作，红十字基层组织都可以协助医疗防疫机构进行，成为医疗防疫机构的耳目手足。这样，就可使工作做得又好、又快、又省，并可使医疗防疫机构能够腾出手来做更多有益于人民健康的医疗、预防工作和医疗预防的技术指导工作。
    红十字组织在活动中，还有一个特殊的作用，即它对会员、卫生员进行革命人道主义的宣传教育，教育会员关心人民的疾苦，以身作则带动邻里亲友讲卫生、讲人道，在人民群众中发扬互助友爱、救死扶伤的革命人道主义精神。这种作用，特别突出地表现在它的救护活动方面。在无锡市，去年有一个渔妇的孩子，头部跌了二寸多长的口子，已见到颅骨，情势很紧急，第二中学红十字卫生员（学生）沈祥秀听到这消息后，立即赶去作了急救处理，并且护送到医院作了进一步的缝合治疗；同时，为了帮助渔妇克服一时的经济困难，沈祥秀还把刚领到的两元助学金送给她作治疗费用，渔妇当时流下了感激的眼泪，周围群众对沈祥秀这种精神表示尊敬，深感红十字活动的高尚和光荣。同年夏天，青岛市郊区一个农业社社员的孩子突然在夜里得了急病，人事不省，家里人绝望了，不知怎么办，社里的红十字卫生员刘秀英闻讯赶到，给病儿作了紧急护理措施后，立即又摸着黑路帮着赶去请医生、买药，还陪着病孩的祖母守护一夜，并按医嘱作冷敷护理，直到天亮病孩好转了才回去。这只是随便举出的两个事例。红十字会员和卫生员在救护活动中，是有不少这样的事例的。他们之中有许多人不怕辛苦，不要报酬，不管白天黑夜、风里雨里，忘我地为伤病人服务，有些事迹是可歌可泣的。这是在社会主义制度下，通过红十字会活动所表现出的新的道德力量，也是红十字基层组织中取之不竭的力量。
    如上所述，很显然，红十字会是可以当做政府卫生部门一种联系群众的桥梁和开展群众卫生工作的助手的。目前加强红十字会的工作，发展红十字会的组织，是有利于贯彻“预防为主”和“卫生工作与群众运动相结合”的方针的。再从精简节约的意义来考虑，加强红十字会的工作，也有好处。因为在目前情况下，完全由国家出人出钱来办群众卫生事业是不可能的。如果运用红十字会组织形式，就可以少花钱、多办事，甚至不花钱也能办事。群众的力量是伟大的。我们的卫生事业为了群众，必须依靠群众。
    总之，红十字会是一个讲卫生、讲人道的人民团体，是我国人民对疾病痛苦作斗争的一支力量。它的一切活动，是为人民健康服务，为社会主义建设事业服务，为人类的进步和文明服务。这是一种人民群众的卫生福利事业。它的一切活动需要广大群众的积极参加，需要社会各个方面的重视和支持。
