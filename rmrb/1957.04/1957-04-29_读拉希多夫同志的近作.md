    Reading Comrade Rashidov's Recent Work
    Wan Feng
    Comrade Rashidov, Vice-Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR and Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic, who is currently visiting our country with Chairman Voroshilov, is not only a Soviet statesman with important responsibilities, but also a person with great literary cultivation. In the midst of his busy political activities, he is still able to find time to write. In March of this year, his recent work, "Song of Kashmir," was published in Tashkent by the State Literature and Art Publishing House of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic. Recently, we had the opportunity to appreciate this work.
    "Song of Kashmir" is based on an ancient folk legend the author heard during his visit to Kashmir. It is a moving and beautiful love story. It has been circulating among the people of Kashmir for a long time, generation after generation, and is still loved by the people today.
    In the Flower Valley, which is full of spring sunshine and blooming flowers, there is a spring flower girl named Nargis. She is deeply in love with a heroic bee king named Bambur. The pain of longing from afar is tormenting this intelligent and beautiful girl. Among the lush greenery, she welcomes the enchanting arrival of spring along with hundreds of birds and flowers. Her clear singing reveals infinite tenderness and affection. Just as she and her girlfriends are singing and dancing, all the tribulations that test her love appear. Black storms, typhoons, and plagues that spread the seeds of death successively ravage the Valley of Flowers. But the brave girl is not intimidated by the evil forces. Together with her girlfriends, she steps forward and fights against the evil forces. In the end, she is almost deprived of her life. In the critical moment of her tribulation, her lover Bambur, together with his comrades-in-arms, arrives in the devastated Valley of Flowers. After a struggle, justice finally triumphs over evil. With the return of spring, the Valley of Flowers is once again covered in gorgeous costumes. Surrounded by thousands of flowers, the couple, who have endured many hardships, receive the most beautiful song of blessing from the nightingale.
    This story expresses the pure love of the people. The love songs sung by Nargis, which are quoted in the book, are full of the charm of folk songs:
    "Oh, you who are eagerly awaited, although you and I are far apart,
    Those who are devoted to you are always looking forward.
    My beloved, come back, don't torment me anymore,
    Without you by my side, I can't close my eyes all night..."
    However, "Song of Kashmir" does not stop at singing about the deep feelings of children. This story praises the people's desire for freedom and liberation. As the author says in the "Postscript" of the book: "The Song of Nargis and Bambur is a fable. It shows the people's long-cherished wish to seek liberation from cruel oppression." At the same time, this story also clearly expresses the idea that "unity is strength." For example, the passage where the cherry blossom girl sings when she encourages morale is like this:
    "If we work together with one heart, friends,
    Then we will eradicate the darkness on the earth,
    Even the weakest starlight, gathered together,
    Will dispel the night."
    In the struggle against evil forces, Nargis always stands with everyone, rather than fighting alone. "Unity is strength" - this is the truth that the people have discovered in their struggle.
    The author's portrayal of the two protagonists is successful. The heroine Nargis is the embodiment of the beauty of life; the hero Bambur is a symbol of heroism and fortitude. Their images are fleshed out and lifelike. When Nargis sings among the flowers, she shows the charm and tenderness of a girl suffering from lovesickness; in the joy of welcoming spring, she is so full of vigorous youthful vitality. When she fights against the black storm, typhoon and plague, she is as strong as steel. How heroic is her spirit of preferring death to submission when the blade is pressed against her neck! In her dialogue with the demons, the author shows us the great soul of this girl. Bambur's heroic posture on the battlefield is also very moving in the author's writing.
    Although Comrade Rashidov's work is prose, his writing is beautiful, and one feels that there is poetry in the prose. The author's efforts have made this beautiful folk tale even more moving and infectious.

    读拉希多夫同志的近作
    万峰
    随同伏罗希洛夫主席正在我国进行访问的苏联最高苏维埃主席团副主席、苏联乌兹别克共和国最高苏维埃主席团主席拉希多夫同志，不仅是苏联的一位身负重任的国务活动家，而且是一个在文学方面很有修养的人。他在繁忙的政治活动中，还能挤出时间来从事写作。今年3月间，他的一部近作“克什米尔之歌”，由苏联乌兹别克共和国国家文学艺术出版局在塔什干出版。最近，我们有机会欣赏了这部作品。
    “克什米尔之歌”是作者根据他在访问克什米尔期间听到的一个古代民间传说写成的。这是一个动人的优美的爱情故事。它在克什米尔人民中间流传了很久，一代接一代，直到现在还为人民所喜爱。
    在春光明媚，百花争妍的鲜花之谷里，有一位叫做娜尔吉丝的春花姑娘。她正热恋着一位英武的蜂王班布尔。两地相思之苦，在折磨着这位聪敏的美丽的姑娘。她在万绿丛中，同百鸟百花一道，迎接迷人般的春天的降临。她的嘹亮的歌声，流露出无限缠绵悱恻之情。正当她同女友们载歌载舞的时候，考验她爱情的一切磨难出现了。散布死亡种籽的黑风暴、台风和瘟神，相继蹂躏了鲜花之谷。但是勇敢的姑娘，没有被恶势力吓倒。她同女友们一起，挺身同恶势力进行了搏斗。最后她险些被夺去了生命。在她蒙难的紧急关头，她的情人班布尔会同战友们，来到了劫后的鲜花之谷。经过一番斗争以后，正义终于战胜了邪恶。随着春天的再度来临，鲜花之谷重新披上了艳丽的华装。这对饱经患难的情侣，在万朵鲜花簇拥中，接受了夜莺的最动听的祝福之歌。
    这个故事写出了人民的纯真的爱情。书中引用了娜尔吉丝所唱的爱情之歌，充满了民歌的风韵：
    “呵，望眼欲穿的人儿呀，虽然你我天各一方，
    但是钟情于你的人总是翘首相望。
    心爱的人儿，回来吧，别再折磨我，——
    没有你在身旁，整夜我都不能合眼……”
    但是，“克什米尔之歌”并没有止于歌唱儿女深情。这个故事歌颂了人民渴望自由、解放的心愿。正如作者在本书“跋”里说的：“关于娜尔吉丝和班布尔之歌，是一个寓言。它表明了人民要从残酷压迫下求得解放的宿愿。”同时，这个故事也鲜明地表达了“团结就是力量”的思想。比如，樱花姑娘在鼓舞斗志时歌唱的那一段就是这样：
    “如果我们协力同心，朋友们呵，
    那就会铲除大地上的黑暗，
    那怕最微弱的星光，聚集起来，
    也会把黑夜驱散。”
    在同恶势力进行斗争中，娜尔吉丝总是和大家站在一起，而不是孤军奋战的。“众志成城”，——这是人民在斗争中发现的真理。
    作者塑造的两个主人公的形象是成功的。女主人公娜尔吉丝是生命之美的化身；男主人公班布尔是英勇刚毅的象征。他们的形象是有血肉的，是栩栩如生的。娜尔吉丝在百花丛中歌唱时，显示了一个为相思所苦的少女的妩媚和脉脉幽情；在迎春的喜悦中，她又是那样地富有蓬勃的青春活力。当她同黑风暴、台风和瘟神搏斗时又是钢铁一般的坚强。在刀刃按在脖子上的时候，她宁死不屈的气魄是多么的豪壮！她同恶魔对话的那一段，作者给我们看到了这个少女的伟大心灵。班布尔驰骋沙场上的英姿，在作者的笔下也非常动人。
    拉希多夫同志的这个作品，虽然是散文体，但是他的文笔优美，令人感到散文里有诗。作者的努力，使这个优美的民间故事，变得更加动人而富有感染力。
