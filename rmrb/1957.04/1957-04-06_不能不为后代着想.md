Title: One Must Think of Future Generations

　　Spring is the season for planting trees and making forests.

　　"The predecessors plant the trees, and the successors enjoy the shade." Farmers have always regarded planting trees and making forests as a way to seek happiness for future generations. Not long ago, when an old farmer in the Qunxing Agricultural Cooperative of Yueyang saw other members indiscriminately cutting down trees, he said angrily: "These trees were left by our ancestors for generations. If they are all cut down now, future generations will have no firewood to burn." What this old farmer said makes sense. There are indeed some people who are not thinking of future generations.

　　Recently, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out at a rural work conference that the afforestation work in Hunan Province this year has been very poor. By the end of February, only 30% of the province's afforestation tasks had been completed. It is said that one of the reasons for the poor completion of the task is due to the erroneous thinking of some cadres and agricultural cooperative members. For example, some cadres believe: "We cadres may be transferred by the organization at any time, so how can we stay here for a lifetime? Afforestation is basically a matter for the masses themselves, and I only need to complete the task." And some agricultural cooperative members say: "Now everything must be joined into the cooperative, and everything is about the collective. It takes decades for trees to grow into timber. By then, they won't care about me, so why should I plant them!"

　　The conference also told such a story. There was an old farmer in Changsha County. As soon as the land reform ended, he busied himself telling his son to plant trees on his land on the back mountain. His son was working in the farmers' association at the time and did not go to plant, but the old man blamed his son and said: "You are so busy that you don't even care about the next generation's affairs. I'm worrying about this, isn't it for your sake? I don't want to rely on these trees for shade, do I?" However, after a few years, his son was promoted from the township to the county as a cadre, and he could send 10 or 20 yuan a month to the old man for pocket money. Now the old man doesn't want to plant trees anymore. When the village cadres mobilized him to plant trees, he said: "Anyway, my boy has to send me some pocket money every month. Now that he is not at home, he doesn't want to rely on this family property. No one cares about planting trees, so why should I plant them?" The thinking of this old man is not an isolated case. Because of this kind of thinking that only cares about the present, not the future, only cares about oneself, and not the next generation, such a phenomenon appears in some places: planting trees every year, burning mountains every year; contracting for planting without guaranteeing survival; planting less and cutting more. No wonder some people sigh: If this continues, in a few decades, not only will national construction be affected, but even building a small house will be difficult.

    不能不为后代着想
    黄驭白
    春天，正是植树造林的季节。
    “前人种树，后人乘凉。”农民们一向都是把植树造林当作为子孙后代谋幸福的事来办的。不久以前，当岳阳群兴农业社一个老农看见别的社员乱砍树木时，他愤怒地说：“这些树都是祖宗万代留下的，现在砍光了，子孙后代就没有柴烧了。”这位老农的话是有道理的，现在的确有些人没有为后世子孙着想。
    最近，中共湖南省委在一次农村工作会议上指出：湖南省今年的造林工作做的很差，到2月底止，全省仅完成造林任务的30％。任务完成不好的原因，据说其中有一条是由于部分干部和农业社员有错误的思想。比方，有的干部认为：“眼前我们当干部的随时都要听组织调动，那能在这里呆一辈子？造林工作基本上是群众自己的事，我只要完成任务就行了。”而有的农业社员却说：“现在样样要入社，样样讲集体，树栽下去要几十年才能成材，到那时它可顾不上我，我又何必栽它呢！”
    会上还讲了这么一个故事。长沙县有一个老农，早先土地改革一结束，他就忙着叫儿子去后山上自己的地里栽树，他儿子当时在农会工作，没有去栽，老头却责备儿子说：“你忙成这个样子，连下一辈子的事也不顾了，我操这份心，还不是为你们着想，难道我还想靠这些树来遮荫不成？”可是，过了这么几年，他儿子由乡里提到县里当了干部，每个月还能捎上一二十元钱给老人家零用了，这老头现在就不想再栽树了。村干部发动他栽树时，他说：“反正我小子每个月多少得给我寄点零用钱，如今他不在家，他不想靠这份家业，栽树也没人管的，我还栽它干什么？”像这位老头的思想也不是个别的。由于有了这种只顾眼前，不顾今后，只顾自己，不顾下辈的思想，便在某些地方出现这样的现象：年年栽树，年年烧山；包栽不包活；栽的少，砍的多。难怪有人慨叹：长此下去，数十年后，不仅国家建设受到影响，就连盖间小房子也困难了。
