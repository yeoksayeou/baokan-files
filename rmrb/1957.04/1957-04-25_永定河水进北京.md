Yongding River Water Enters Beijing
By our reporters Fu Dong and Dian Yi

April 24th. A light drizzle. The river dam at Sanjiadian was crowded with people.

The Yongding River roared as it surged from the opposite mountains, flowing to the seventeen gate openings of the dam where it was stopped.

The first time we came to Sanjiadian was in May of last year. At that time, the dam piers had not yet been completed, and this place was still a sandy area, with people everywhere on the construction site. Some were tying steel bars, others were pushing concrete in carts. Many workers were stripped to the waist, still sweating profusely from the heat.

We asked them why they were working so hard. They said, "Are you from Beijing? Then you must know the suffering of not having enough water. We are doing this so that the people of Beijing can have enough water to drink and use freely."

Indeed, we have met many people who complained: in the hottest summer months, sometimes there is no water at noon to wash their faces or take a bath. Some factories in the eastern suburbs also complained that they could not pump water from the wells. People living on the fourth floor and above often complained that the water could not reach their apartments. I contacted the water company, and the cadres there said that the population of Beijing had increased from one million to four million since liberation, but the water supply remained the same, with only one ton of surface water coming in per second. The groundwater is also scarce. In addition, people's living standards have improved, and they wash clothes and bathe more frequently than before, and more people are using flush toilets. More importantly, the number of factories is increasing day by day. How can such a small amount of water be enough? He gave us an account: in 1952, the average daily water consumption per person was only 19.3 liters; in 1953, it increased to 28.75 liters; and by 1956, it had increased to 59.49 liters. How could the water not be in short supply?

In fact, the people of Beijing have long felt the pain of water shortage. Many dynasties have thought of ways to divert water. More than 1,700 years ago, during the Three Kingdoms period, a man named Liu Jing tried to divert water from the Yongding River. Later, a man named Fan Chen also tried. However, the Yongding River water was really unruly, like a madman, sometimes only a little water would come, and sometimes it would suddenly become huge. The canals that were opened did not last long, and after a flood, they would all collapse. People in the Jin and Yuan dynasties also made efforts, but they also failed because they could not control the Yongding River's torrential floods and sediment. When there were floods, many places were still flooded. During the Qing Dynasty, Emperor Kangxi had no choice but to build a section of stone embankment and changed the name of the river from "Wuding River" (Unstable River) to Yongding River (Forever Stable River). But the water was still sometimes too much and sometimes too little.

Well, only a few years after liberation, the government built the Guanting Reservoir, which brought the disobedient Yongding River under control. The water no longer flows erratically. Now the river water is not only really stable forever, but it is also entering the city to be used by the water-deficient city of Beijing.

People were discussing the past and present of the Yongding River on the dam. At exactly four o'clock, it was announced that the meeting was about to begin. As soon as the bright red ribbons were cut, the workers began to move the closing machine nervously, and more than a dozen 20-ton gate doors fell down. Watching the water under their feet rise little by little, at that moment, the two big doors of the intake gate opened. The water roared and made a noise, churning white waves, passing through the steel gate and flowing into the canal.

The water of the Yongding River flows eastward along the canal, the water is clear, green water, it looks really comfortable! I really want to run down and drink a few mouthfuls.

Time passed second by second. Now the water should be flowing into the new 700-meter-long tunnel under the Cuiwei Peak in the Western Hills! That is really a remarkable tunnel, which completely pierced through a mountain. We still remember the scene when we passed through the tunnel before it was opened. The tunnel was pitch black, and we walked inside for a long time, but we still couldn't reach the end. As we walked, we wondered what kind of people had pierced this mountain little by little? How much sweat did they shed in order to let the water flow to Beijing? Where are those mountain openers now? Let the people of Beijing pay tribute to these heroic people!

At this moment, the water may be rushing down to the Moshikou Hydropower Station! We seem to hear the sound of the water hitting the turbine rotating, and we also remember what the staff there told us: this hydropower station can light up 60,000 100-watt electric lights per hour, which is enough for a city of 100,000 people, and the cost is two-thirds cheaper than thermal power generation.

After the Yongding River water leaves Sanjiadian, one stream flows to Moshikou, and the other flows to Shijingshan.

What about Comrade Liu Ren of the Shijingshan Power Plant Reconstruction Office? He must be watching the water enter the plant at this time, right? He must be saying again: "Water, water is the lifeline of the power plant." The last time we went to the power plant for an interview, he told us this, saying that although their plant is right next to the Yongding River, it is really not easy to draw a little water into the plant! What he said is right. They use such large electric pumps to draw water, and use such thick and long pipes to draw water to the sedimentation tank and then to the workshop. After use, they dare not throw away all the water, they have to send it to the spray pool, cool it down, and then recycle it. People in the factory said that it is okay on ordinary days, but in the dry season of May and June, they cannot draw water, so they have to use willow strips to weave many baskets and pile them up in Sanjiadian to raise the water level, so that they can draw water to the water inlet of the electric pump. They have to do this twice every year, and they have to spend four or five thousand yuan every year. It is worrying when there is little water, and it is also worrying when there is too much water in summer. When there is too much water, there is too much sand, and there are 40 kilograms of sand in 100 kilograms of water, and the sedimentation tank is useless. The spray pool is also full of sediment, so we have to dig it! The four spray pools are dug in rotation every year, and it costs 10,000 to 20,000 yuan to dig one. Not to mention the cost, the spray pool has to be shut down when digging, and the shut down will affect the water temperature. If the water temperature is too high, the electricity generated will be reduced.

Comrade Liu Ren gave us an account: After the dam is repaired, the Yongding River water flows in. The few people in charge of the electric pump can be spared, and the spray pool does not need to be dug, saving tens of thousands of yuan a year. Without using electricity to draw water, and without using electricity to spray water for cooling, all the electricity can be saved for users. He said excitedly that in this way, more than 500,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity can be saved a month, and more than 6 million kilowatt-hours of electricity can be saved a year! If one kilowatt-hour of electricity is calculated at 8.5 cents, more than 5.1 million yuan can be saved a year, which is more than enough to build a hydropower station with this money.

After leaving the power plant, the water will flow to the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant in a few days. Water is also a treasure for this factory, and it cannot be without it for a minute. Blast furnaces need water, and coking, coal washing, and boilers all need water. In order to get water, the factory has also spent a lot of effort, building water diversion walls, sand discharge gates, water intake gates, pumping stations, sand settling ponds, and reservoirs. There are three reservoirs, as big as a lake, with dredgers parked inside, digging all year round. There are more than 100 people in the whole factory just in charge of water! Now this factory has built new pipelines, and the amount of water coming in is several times more than before. Only two people are needed to manage the water.

The water continues to flow eastward along the newly opened wide river channel to Shuanghuaishu. Here, the water is divided into two branches again.

The branch of water flowing south from Shuanghuaishu flows south along the widened river channel of the South Dry River. These days, it should be going to Yuyuantan, to the natural swimming pool at Xibianmen, and to the moat! Before the river channel was repaired, we had been to these places. Judging from the name, the South Dry River and the moat are rivers, but in fact, they are two stinky and dirty small ditches. The ditch outside Xibianmen is only one or two feet wide, and you can jump over it without much effort. There is everything thrown in it, livestock manure, garbage, feces, weeds... It stinks in the summer, and everyone has to cover their noses when they pass by, and livestock will get sick if they drink it. An old water worker, Wang Shutian, who has been repairing tap water for more than 20 years, said that only one or two hundred liters of clean water flow into the moat per second, while the amount of dirty water discharged into the river from the sewer is five or six times more. How can it not be dirty and stinky!

In just a short time, this place is completely different. Not only is it smooth and wide, but some places on the bank are also covered with grass, and some places are planted with various kinds of flowers and trees. In a while, adults and children will be able to swim in Xibianmen.

This wide and deep river channel looks so comfortable! But it is permeated with the sweat of so many people! It not only contains the sweat of officers, soldiers, and farmers, but also the sweat of workers, cadres, teachers, students, and housewives! Last year in March and April, if you came here on Sunday, you would definitely see them carrying dirt baskets, swinging sledgehammers, and carrying dirt clods.

The northern branch of water will flow through Zizhuyuan in a few days, enter the city through Deshengmen, and flow to Jishuitan, Shichahai, Beihai, and Zhongnanhai.

Comrade Zhang of the Beihai Park Management Office said that the lake was incredibly dirty before liberation, with all kinds of messy things in it. The seepage well of the park's toilet was also bad, making the lake water stinky and dirty. After liberation, it was dredged once, and there were much fewer weeds, but the whole city only had one ton of water flowing in per second. So there was no way to get water for the rivers and lakes! There was no way to change the water only twice a year. No wonder when people row boats, they stir up a piece of dirty mud when they shake it. The park sent four boats and twelve people to salvage dirty things all year round, but it could not solve the problem. After the Yongding River water is connected, there will be clean and clear water flowing in every moment, and no one should complain about the water being dirty anymore.

The water flows out of the park and reaches the Jinshui Bridge in Tiananmen Square. On May Day, Chairman Mao can stand on Tiananmen Square and see this clear water.

The water from the north and south routes meets in Qian San Men and flows to the eastern suburbs. As soon as the water arrives in the eastern suburbs, it changes the scale of the capital's thermal power station under construction. Comrades from the thermal power station said that the original design was to generate 50,000 to 100,000 kilowatts, but later they heard that the Yongding River water was coming, so they changed it to 200,000 kilowatts. The water flows from the eastern suburbs to Tongxian County, and 100,000 mu of farmland will enjoy the benefits of this tailwater.

A few years later, when people visit the Yongding River again, they will wonder if they have taken the wrong road. Look at the weeping willows, poplars, flowering peaches, albizia, and forsythia on both sides, so many, so beautiful, clearly a garden. Who would have thought that a few years ago it was just a bare river channel.

Thinking further, after the Yongding River is diverted, the Chaobai River and Luan River water will also be diverted. At that time, if the people of Beijing want to visit the Bohai Sea, they do not need to take a train, they can take a boat to get there. (Attached pictures)

    永定河水进北京
    本报记者　傅冬　甸义
    4月24日。细雨绵绵。三家店的拦河闸上站满了人。
    永定河的水叫着，从对面的群山里涌来，流到十七个像城门洞一样大的闸门前，被截住了。
    我们头一次到三家店来，是在去年5月。那时候闸墩还没有修好，这里还是一片沙地，工地上到处是人。有的在扎钢筋，有的用小车推着混凝土跑。好多工人光着膀子，还热得浑身是汗。
    我们问他们为什么这样卖劲？他们说：“你们是北京人吧？那你一定知道水不够的苦。我们就为了叫北京人能痛痛快快的吃水、用水。”
    可不是吗，我们碰到过好些人，都诉苦说：夏天顶热的时候，有时中午就没水洗脸洗澡。东郊的一些工厂也嚷井里抽不上水来。住在四层楼以上的人常叫水上不了楼。我找过自来水公司，那里的干部说，北京的人口已经由解放前的一百几十万增到四百万，而水还是老样子，地面水一秒钟只来一吨。地下水也少得可怜。加上人民生活提高了，洗衣服，洗澡比以前勤了，用抽水马桶的也多起来了；更重要的是工厂一天天多起来了，那么一点点水，怎么够用？他给我们算了个账：1952年每人每天平均用水量只有十九点三公升；1953年增到二十八点七五公升；到1956年便增到五十九点四九公升了。水怎么会不紧张呢？
    其实，北京人老早就感到缺水的苦了。好些朝代都想过法子引水。一千七百多年前三国时候，有一个叫刘靖的，就试着引永定河的水。以后有个叫樊晨的，也试过。可是这永定河的水真不规矩，好像个疯子似的，要末只来一小点点水，要末一下子大得不得了，开的渠没用多久，洪水一来，就全垮了。金朝、元朝也有人努力过，也因治不了永定河暴涨的洪水和水里的泥沙，失败了，发大水的时候，好些地方还是照样被淹。清朝康熙皇帝没办法，筑了一截石堤，把河的名字由“无定河”改成永定河。可是水还是一下子多，一下子少。
    好了，解放才几年，政府就修了个官厅水库，把不听话的永定河管起了。水不再忽大忽小的流了。现在河水不但真的永定了，而且要进城给缺水的北京市用了。
    人们正在拦河闸上谈论着永定河的过去和现在。四点正，宣布开会了。鲜红的彩绸刚刚剪开，工人就紧张地搬动起闭机，十几扇二十多吨重的闸门落下来了。眼看着脚底下的水一点点涨了起来，就在这个时候，进水闸的两个大门打开了。水吼着闹着翻着白色的浪花，从钢门下穿过，流向渠道。
    永定河的水，顺着渠道向东流去，水，清清的，绿色的水，看上去真舒服呵！真想跑下去喝它几口。
    时间一秒一秒地过去了。现在水该流到那在西山微翠峰下新开的七百多公尺长的隧洞了吧？那真是一条了不起的隧洞，整整打通了一座山。我们还记得没通水前，穿过隧洞时的情景。洞里黑漆漆的，我们在里面走了好长一段时间，还走不到头。我们一面走，一面想，是什么样的人把这山一点点打通的？为了叫水流到北京，他们流了多少汗？此刻那些开山的人在那儿？让北京人向这些英雄的人们致敬！
    这会儿水兴许向模式口水电站冲下去了吧！我们似乎听到了水冲打涡轮旋转的声音，同时也想起了那里的工作人员给我们讲的话：这水电站一点钟可以照亮六万盏一百度的电灯，可以够十万人的城市用，而成本要比火力发电便宜三分之二。
    永定河水离开三家店以后，一股流到模式口，另一股流向了石景山。
    石景山发电厂改建处的刘仁同志呢？他这会一定在看水进厂吧？他一定又在说：“水呀，水是发电厂的命根子。”我们有一次去发电厂采访，他就这样给我们讲过，他说他们厂虽然就在永定河旁边，可是要引一点水进厂真不容易呵！他说的一点不错。他们用那么高大的电泵抽水，用那么粗那么长的管子把水引到沉淀池再引到车间。用过后，还不敢把水全抛掉，还得送到喷水池，冷后再循环着用。厂里的人说，平常日子还好说，到五、六月枯水时候，抽不上水来，只好用柳条编成许多筐子堆在三家店，提高水位，才能把水引到电泵进水的地方。年年都得来这么二次，年年都得花四、五千块钱。水少伤脑筋，夏天水多也伤脑子。水多，沙多，一百斤水里有四十斤沙子，沉淀池都不顶用了。喷水池也给弄得尽是泥沙，只好挖吧！四个喷水池年年轮流着挖，挖一个，得花一、二万块钱。花钱不说，挖的时候喷水池要停用，一停就影响水温，水温一高，发的电就少了。
    刘仁同志给我们算了个账：拦河闸修好后，永定河水流来了。管电泵的几个人可以省去了，喷水池也不要挖了，一年就可省下几万块钱。不用电抽水，不用电喷水冷却，那些电都可省下来给用户用。他眉飞色舞地说，这样一个月就可省五十多万度电，一年就可省六百多万度电！一度电按八分五算，一年可省五百一十多万元，用这钱盖一个水电站还有余。
    从发电厂出来，过几天水就会流到石景山钢铁厂了。水，对这个厂也是宝贝，一分钟也缺不得，高炉要水，炼焦、洗煤、锅炉样样离不了水，为了弄水，工厂也没少费事，修了导水墙、排沙闸、进水闸、抽水站、沉沙池、蓄水池。三个蓄水池，大得像个湖，里面停着挖泥船，成年间在挖。光管水的全厂就有一百多人！现在这个厂修了新管道，来的水比以前多了好几倍，管水的，只要两个人就行了。
    水沿着新开的宽阔的河道继续东流到双槐树了。到这里水又分成了两支。
    由双槐树往南流的那支水，沿着南旱河加宽了的河道往南走。这阵子该到玉渊潭、该到西便门的天然游泳场了吧！该到护城河了吧！没修好河道以前，我们到过这些地方。从名字上看，南旱河、护城河是条河，实际上是两条又臭又脏的小沟。西便门外的沟呢，只有一、二尺宽，不用什么劲，就能跳过去。里面扔的什么都有，牲口粪、垃圾、大便、杂草……一到夏天臭气熏天，人人走过都要捂鼻子，牲口喝了也要害病。一位修了二十多年自来水的老工人王树田说，护城河一秒钟只有一、二百公升干净水进来，而下水道每秒钟排到河里的脏水反倒多出五、六倍，这怎么能不脏不臭呢！
    才多少时候，这里就完全不一样了。不但修的又平又宽，有的地方岸上还铺了草皮，有的地方种了各式各样的花和树。再过些时，大人小孩便可以在西便门游泳了。
    这又宽又深的河道，看起来多么舒服！可这里面渗透着多少人的汗珠呵！这里面不但有军官、战士、农民的汗，还有工人、干部、教师、学生和家庭妇女的汗！去年三、四月里，要是星期天到这儿来，一定可以看到他们在抬土筐、抡大锤、背土块。
    北面的一支水，过几天就要流过紫竹院、由德胜门进城，流到积水潭、什刹海、北海和中南海。
    北海公园管理处的张同志说过，解放前湖里脏的不像话，什么乱七八糟的东西都有。公园厕所的渗井也不好，把湖水弄得又臭又脏。解放后挖了一次，杂草少多了，可是全市一秒钟一共才有一吨水流进来，那轮得到给河湖！没法子，一年只换二次水，难怪人划船的时候，一摇就摇起一片脏泥。公园派了四条船和十二个人整年整月地打捞脏东西，也不能解决问题。永定河水通了以后，每时每刻都有干干净净的清水流进来，这下该不会再有人埋怨水脏了。
    水从公园出来，流到了天安门的金水桥。五一节那天，毛主席站在天安门上就可以看见这清清的水了。
    南北两路水在前三门会合，流到东郊，水一到东郊改变了正在建设的首都热电站的规模。热电站的同志说，原先设计发电五万瓩到十万瓩，后来听说永定河的水要来，就改成了二十万瓩。水从东郊流往通县去了，有十万亩农田将享受这尾水的余润。
    几年以后，再游永定河时人们将会怀疑是不是走错道儿了。你瞧两岸的垂柳、穿天杨、碧桃、合欢、连翘，那样多，那样美，明明是一座花园，那里想到几年前只是一条光秃秃的河道。
    再想得远点，在永定河引来后，又引来了潮白河、滦河的水，那时候北京人要是想去逛渤海，不必坐火车，坐船就可以到了。（附图片）
