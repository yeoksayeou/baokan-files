Baotou Steel's Ore Base - Bayan Obo
    Sketch by Yu Jian
    In the sunny April, the great rivers and north and south of the motherland are already full of flowers and greenery, but on the grasslands of Inner Mongolia it is still a scene of "thousands of miles of ice and ten thousand miles of snow". The newly emerging industrial city of Bayan Obo, near the Sino-Mongolian border, stands among the snow-capped peaks of the Ula Mountains, more than 1,600 meters above sea level.
    Bayan Obo, in Mongolian, means "rich mountain". True to its name, it not only has abundant iron, but also a lot of quartz stone. However, these resources had been dormant for tens of thousands of years, from the time of its geological formation until before liberation. Only today have the people awakened it to serve socialist industrialization.

    包钢的矿石基地——白云鄂博
    于践速写
    阳春4月，祖国的大江南北已经是花红草绿了，可是在内蒙古草原上依然是“千里冰封，万里雪瓢”。靠近中蒙边境的新兴工业城市——白云鄂博就矗立在白雪皑皑、拔海一千六百多公尺的乌拉山群峰之中。
    白云鄂博，蒙语的含意是“富饶的山”。名副其实，这里不仅有丰富的铁，而且还有不少的石英石。可是这些资源，从它的地质构造形成的年代起到解放前为止，已经沉睡了几万年。只是到了今天，人民才把它唤醒来，为社会主义工业化服务。
