Addressing Questions and Concerns Raised in Discussions
Peng Zhen Delivers Report at Beijing Municipal Propaganda Work Conference

    (Our newspaper dispatch) Peng Zhen, First Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, delivered a report on the 20th at an enlarged propaganda work conference attended by more than 2,800 people, addressing the questions raised during the citywide discussion of Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference. Yang Shu, Director of the Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department, gave a summary of the conference on the 19th.

    To date, excluding central government agencies, approximately 350,000 cadres both inside and outside the Party, faculty and staff of universities and secondary schools, university students, members of various democratic parties, and people from industry and commerce throughout the city have studied and discussed Chairman Mao's speech, generating a very wide response and enthusiastic discussions. Many people have realized that the two types of contradictions—namely, the contradiction between ourselves and the enemy and the contradiction among the people—must be resolved using different principles and methods. To correctly handle contradictions among the people, it is necessary to overcome shortcomings in work, overcome subjectivism, sectarianism, and bureaucratism, and strengthen ideological and political education. Many cadres have examined their past thoughts and feelings that contradicted the central government's policies, their rigid work styles, and their one-sided ways of thinking. Many veteran professors, writers, and artists have expressed their willingness to actively participate in debates and exert their strengths. However, many questions were raised in the discussions, exposing many vague understandings and erroneous ideas. The main erroneous ideas were fears that "letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend" would release many poisonous weeds, create ideological confusion among the masses, make work difficult, make it difficult to lead the masses, and so on.

    In response to these questions and concerns, Peng Zhen focused in his speech on the question of how to correctly handle contradictions among the people.

    **The Key Lies in Distinguishing the Nature of the Two Types of Contradictions**

    Why is it necessary to raise the question of correctly handling contradictions among the people now? Peng Zhen said that this is because Chinese history has entered a new period. The class contradictions in our country have been basically resolved, the remnants of counter-revolution have been basically eliminated, and contradictions among the people have become prominent. However, many of our comrades have not kept up with the development of objective things in their understanding. Therefore, many comrades have many erroneous understandings and muddled ideas about the question of contradictions among the people. They are not only not good at handling contradictions among the people, but sometimes adopt completely wrong handling principles and methods.

    Regarding how to treat contradictions among the people, Peng Zhen said that the key lies in distinguishing the nature of the two types of contradictions and adopting fundamentally different principles and methods to deal with them. To deal with contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, we must use the method of dictatorship to overthrow, subdue, forcibly reform, and eliminate the enemy. But contradictions among the people are internal affairs of the people. How can we deal with them in the same way as we deal with the enemy? Except for those who violate laws and commit crimes who should be dealt with according to law, all contradictions among the people can only be dealt with with a comradely attitude, democratic methods, and methods of discussion and persuasion, starting from the desire for unity, and reaching new unity on a new basis through criticism or struggle.

    **Petitions Are Not Illegal, No Need to Fear Disturbances**

    Peng Zhen pointed out that some masses send representatives to petition the higher authorities to solve problems. The method they adopt is a legitimate means and not an illegal act. Leading cadres should not be afraid, let alone obstruct or suppress them. As for some units where the leadership is very bureaucratic, does not speak of democracy, does not even have a little democracy, or lacks the necessary ideological and political work among the masses, so the masses rise up to make "trouble," there is no need to be afraid either. We should discuss with the masses very well and solve the problem correctly. For the demands raised by the masses, those that should be handled and can be handled must be resolved quickly. For the problems raised by the masses that cannot be solved at present and for wrong opinions, we should explain them to the masses clearly in a realistic and patient manner.

    **Those Who Fear Letting Go and Fear Debate Are Cowards**

    Peng Zhen said that "letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend" is a driving force to promote the continuous improvement of our understanding and the continuous progress of our work. Since contradictions among the people can only be handled by democratic methods, can only be persuaded, and cannot be suppressed, we can only adopt the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend" for the different thoughts that objectively exist among the people. We must realize that things develop in the struggle of contradictions, and truth becomes clearer the more it is debated. What are fragrant flowers, what are poisonous weeds, what is truth, and what is error, can only be compared and distinguished after they are released and only in the debate. It is wrong to only allow you to speak and not allow me to speak, or to only allow me to speak and not allow you to speak. Those who fear letting go and fear debate are cowards, people who are not capable. We must welcome the blooming together and welcome the contention.

    Peng Zhen said that the relationship between the Party and non-Party members is basically good now, but there are also many problems. The main problem at present is that "letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend" is not released enough, and the contention is not enough. We must let go and let the contention. Party members and non-Party members must cooperate closely and discuss matters well when things happen. Don't "respect ghosts and gods and keep them at a distance." We must trust the masses, listen to the opinions of the masses with an open mind, and discuss them patiently together.

    **The First Secretary Must Personally Grasp Ideological Work**

    Peng Zhen mentioned the issue of strengthening ideological and political work. He said that ideological work is a complex and arduous task. He pointed out that Party committees at all levels must do ideological work, and the first secretary of the Party committee must personally grasp ideological work. All government departments and mass organizations must do ideological work. How to do ideological work? Peng Zhen said: We must use the method of "from the masses, to the masses," closely contact the masses, collect the opinions of the masses in a timely manner, study and analyze them using Marxist methods, discuss them well with the masses, and then implement them among the masses. Some comrades do not approach the masses, do not collect the opinions of the masses, or do not study them even if they hear them. They just like to randomly put on hats and indiscriminately label things. This is a dogmatic way of thinking.

    **The Whole Party Must Re-learn and Transform Ideology**

    Finally, Peng Zhen proposed that in the face of the new stage, new situation, and new problems, the whole Party must re-learn, transform ideology, summarize work, examine ideology, and carry out rectification in accordance with the spirit of Chairman Mao's report at the Supreme State Conference, in order to correctly handle contradictions among the people and quickly learn to lead the work of socialist construction.

    Yang Shu gave a concluding speech, addressing specific issues raised by everyone during the conference regarding how to handle contradictions among the people, further implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom, letting a hundred schools of thought contend," strengthen the relationship between the Party and non-Party intellectuals, primary and secondary school education, and strengthen ideological and political work.

    **Party Members Should Actively Contact Non-Party Intellectuals**

    When talking about the relationship between the Party and intellectuals, Yang Shu said that the relationship between the Party and intellectuals in this city is basically good, but the relationship between Party and non-Party intellectuals is not close enough at present, and the ideological transformation of intellectuals is not done enough. In future work, Party members and non-Party comrades must establish a good cooperative working relationship and jointly discuss and solve major issues in their units. Party members, especially Party leading cadres, must take the initiative to conduct direct, comradely contact with non-Party intellectuals.

    针对讨论中所提出的问题和各种顾虑
    彭真在北京市宣传工作会议上作报告
    本报讯　中共北京市委第一书记彭真在20日召开的、有两千八百多人参加的宣传工作会议扩大会上，就全市讨论毛主席在最高国务会议上的讲话所提出的问题作了报告。市委宣传部部长杨述在19日作了这次会议的总结。
    截至目前为止，除中央直属机关外，全市已有党内外干部、高等学校教职员和中小学教职员、高等学校学生、各民主党派人士和工商界约三十五万多人学习讨论了毛主席的讲话，引起了十分广泛的反响和热烈的讨论。许多人认识到两种矛盾，即敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾的解决，必须采取不同的方针和办法，要正确处理人民内部矛盾就必须克服工作中的缺点，克服主观主义、宗派主义和官僚主义，必须加强思想政治教育。有不少干部检查了过去与中央方针抵触的思想情绪、生硬的工作作风和片面的思想方法。许多老教授、文学家、艺术家们表示要积极参加争鸣，发挥自己的力量。但是，在讨论中也提出了许多问题，暴露出不少模糊认识和错误思想。主要的错误思想是害怕“百花齐放、百家争鸣”会放出许多毒草，造成群众思想混乱，使工作不好作，对群众不好领导等等。
    针对着这些问题和顾虑，彭真在大会上着重地讲了关于如何正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题。
    关键在于分清两种矛盾的性质
    为什么现在要提出正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题？彭真说，这是因为中国的历史进入了一个新的时期。我国国内阶级矛盾已经基本解决，反革命残余已经基本肃清，人民内部矛盾就显露出来了。但是我们很多同志，在认识上却赶不上客观事物的发展。因此，不少同志在关于人民内部矛盾问题上有许多错误的认识和胡涂想法，不但不善于处理人民内部矛盾，而且有时采取了完全错误的处理方针和办法。
    关于怎样对待人民内部的矛盾，彭真说，关键是在于分清两种矛盾的性质，采取根本不同的方针和方法来处理。对待敌我矛盾，要用专政的方法，打倒、压服、强制改造、消灭敌人；而人民内部的矛盾，是人民内部的家务，怎么能像对待敌人那样处理呢？除了对违法犯罪的分子应该依法处理外，对于一切人民内部的矛盾只能用同志式的态度，民主的方法，讨论说服的方法，从团结的愿望出发，经过批评或斗争，在新的基础上达到新的团结。
    请愿不是违法，闹事不应害怕
    彭真指出，有些群众推派代表向上级领导去请愿，要求解决问题，他们所采取的是一种正当的手段，并不是违法的行为，领导干部不应当害怕，更不应当阻挠、压制。至于有些单位领导上官僚主义很严重，不讲民主，连小小民主都没有，或者在群众中缺乏应有的思想政治工作，群众起来“闹事”，也不应当害怕。应该和群众很好地商议，正确地解决。对于群众提出的要求，凡是应该办和可能办的，必须迅速地解决；对于群众所提的现在还不可能解决的问题和错误的意见，应该实事求是地耐心地向群众解释清楚。
    怕放、怕鸣的人是怯懦的人
    彭真说，“百花齐放、百家争鸣”是促使我们认识不断提高、工作不断前进的推动力，既然人民内部的矛盾只能用民主的方法来处理，只能说服，不能压服，我们对于人民内部客观存在的不同思想，就只能采取“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，我们要认识到，事物是在矛盾的斗争中发展的，真理是愈辩愈明的。哪些是香花，哪些是毒草，哪些是真理，哪些是错误，只有在放出来以后，只有在争鸣中，才能有比较，才能明辨是非。只准你鸣、不准我鸣或者只准我鸣、不准你鸣都是不对的。怕放、怕鸣的人是怯懦的人，是没本事的人。我们要欢迎齐放，欢迎争鸣。
    彭真说，党与非党的关系现在基本上是好的，但是问题也不少。当前主要的问题是对于“百花齐放、百家争鸣”放得不够，鸣得不够，要放手放，放手鸣；党员与非党人士要亲密地合作，遇事很好地商量，不要“敬鬼神而远之”；要相信群众，虚心听群众的意见，耐心共同讨论。
    第一书记要亲自抓思想工作
    彭真提到了加强思想政治工作问题。他说，思想工作是一项复杂的、艰苦的工作。他指出各级党委都要作思想工作，党委第一书记要亲自抓思想工作。政府各部门、群众团体都要作思想工作。怎样做思想工作？彭真说：就要运用从群众中来到群众中去的方法，要密切联系群众，及时地把群众中的意见搜集起来，用马克思主义的方法加以研究分析，并且和群众很好地商量，然后再贯彻到群众中去。有些同志不接近群众，不搜集群众意见，或是听到了意见也不研究，就是喜欢乱戴帽子瞎扣名词，这是教条主义的思想方法。
    全党要重新学习，改造思想
    最后，彭真提出，在新阶段、新形势、新问题面前，全党要重新学习，改造思想，按照毛主席在最高国务会议上的报告的精神，总结工作，检查思想，进行整风，以便正确地处理人民内部的矛盾，尽快地学会领导社会主义建设的工作。
    杨述针对会议期间大家提出的有关如何处理人民内部矛盾，进一步贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，密切党与非党知识分子的关系、中小学教育、以及加强思想政治工作等方面的具体问题，作了总结发言。
    党员要主动和非党知识分子接触
    杨述在谈到党和知识分子的关系时说，本市党和知识分子的关系基本上是好的，但是目前党和非党知识分子间的关系还不够密切，知识分子的思想改造工作也作得不够。在今后各项工作中，党员和党外同志要建立良好的合作共事关系，共同讨论和解决本单位的重大问题；党员特别是党员领导干部要主动地和非党知识分子进行直接的同志式的接触。
