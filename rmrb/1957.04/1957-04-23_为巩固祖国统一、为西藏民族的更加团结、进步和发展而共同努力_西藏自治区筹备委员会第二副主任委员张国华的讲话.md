The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region has been established for a full year. Today, we are commemorating this day, which has great significance for the unity and progress of the Tibetan people, here and at all levels of the Jiqiao-level offices.

One year ago today, with the personal assistance and guidance of the Central Delegation led by Vice Premier Chen Yi, and under the personal direction of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region was formally established. The Preparatory Committee is an organ with governmental power responsible for preparing for the establishment of the Tibet Autonomous Region, and is an important step in promoting national regional autonomy in the Tibet region. Its main tasks are: to unite people from all walks of life to further strengthen unity between nationalities and within the Tibetan nationality, to organize and lead anti-imperialist and patriotic propaganda and education work, to enhance patriotic thought, and to be responsible for consultation, unified planning and handling of matters related to the construction of Tibet and other matters that should and can be handled.

Over the past year, thanks to the leadership and close concern of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao; thanks to the direct leadership of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni; thanks to the unity, cooperation and joint efforts of all cadres and staff, especially Tibetan cadres and staff, and the monks and lay people; the work of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region has been successful. It has done much work beneficial to the political, economic and cultural development of the Tibetan people. It has further strengthened the relations between the central government and the Tibetan local government, as well as among all aspects of the Tibetan nationality, and has played an active role in further strengthening unity between nationalities and within the Tibetan nationality and in increasing the patriotic thought of the Tibetan people. It has also achieved certain results in specific tasks such as medical treatment, epidemic prevention, disaster relief, and construction. All of these fully demonstrate that the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region has an undeniable role in promoting the unity, progress and development of the Tibetan people. Therefore, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region is supported by other fraternal nationalities of the motherland and increasingly endorsed by the broad masses of the Tibetan people. Therefore, we can definitely say that the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region is a good organizational form that conforms to the specific conditions of Tibet at present, and it is also a good organizational form for the Tibetan nationality to transition to regional autonomy. Its establishment is necessary and timely.

Over the past year, our work has been successful; but there are also shortcomings and errors in our work. Last year, at the inaugural meeting of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, it was proposed that Tibet should take the socialist road and gradually carry out democratic reforms, which was the correct direction. However, due to insufficient comprehensive analysis and research on the objective and subjective conditions of the Tibetan region, the preparations for democratic reforms were started too early, and some tasks were spread out too widely. In the work process of the Preparatory Committee, there was insufficient consultation in some areas, and the enthusiasm and initiative of Tibetan cadres were not fully utilized, which affected certain tasks to a certain extent. These shortcomings and errors must be resolutely overcome in future work.

Regarding the issue of democratic reform in Tibet. The Tibetan nationality, like other fraternal nationalities of the motherland, must take the socialist road. Only in this way can the political, economic and cultural development of the Tibetan nationality be greatly developed, and only in this way can the Tibetan nationality be permanently freed from poverty and backwardness. However, certain conditions are required to achieve peaceful reform in the Tibetan region, such as the people's demand for reform and the support of the upper strata for reform. At present, these conditions are not fully met. Therefore, the central government has decided that democratic reforms in the Tibetan region will not be carried out during the second five-year plan, and whether or not to reform during the third five-year plan will be decided by the Tibetan national leaders, representatives and the people through consultation based on the situation at that time. This provides a greater possibility for taking the path of peaceful reform in the future.

Democratic reforms will not be carried out in the Tibetan region for the next six years. Based on this situation, the institutions established in the past to prepare for democratic reforms naturally need to be appropriately reduced, and some of the Han Chinese personnel who came to help the Tibetan nationality prepare for democratic reforms will also be transferred to participate in the socialist construction work in other regions of the motherland. The current streamlining of institutions and the transfer of some personnel back to the mainland is for this reason.

As we commemorate the first anniversary of the establishment of the Preparatory Committee, we must know that every achievement of the Preparatory Committee contributes to the unity, progress and development of the Tibetan nationality and to the construction cause of the motherland. At the same time, we must also know that the more united and progressive the Tibetan nationality becomes, the more imperialist elements will use various forms to spread rumors, slander, and sow discord and sabotage in many ways. Therefore, we must unite more closely, unite under the banner of anti-imperialism and patriotism, continue to do a good job in the work of the Preparatory Committee, further improve the unity between nationalities and within the Tibetan nationality, strengthen patriotic propaganda and education, gradually and conscientiously implement the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet" and the various tasks of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region itself, and always be vigilant against the subversive activities of imperialist elements and the activities of separatist elements who betray the motherland. Finally, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao, under the direct leadership of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni and the CPC Tibet Working Committee, let us work together to consolidate national unity and to achieve greater unity, progress and development of the Tibetan people.

### 为巩固祖国统一、为西藏民族的更加团结、进步和发展而共同努力  西藏自治区筹备委员会第二副主任委员张国华的讲话

    为巩固祖国统一、为西藏民族的更加团结、进步和发展而共同努力
    西藏自治区筹备委员会第二副主任委员张国华的讲话
    西藏自治区筹备委员会成立已经整整一周年了。今天在这里和各地基巧级办事处，都在纪念这个对西藏民族团结、进步有着重大意义的日子。
    去年的今天，在以陈毅副总理为首的中央代表团亲临帮助指导下，在达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼的亲自主持下，正式成立了西藏自治区筹备委员会，西藏自治区筹备委员会是负责筹备西藏自治区的带政权性质的机关，是在西藏地区推行民族区域自治的一个重要步骤。它的主要任务是：团结各方面人士进一步加强民族间的团结和西藏民族内部的团结，组织领导反帝爱国的宣传教育工作，增强爱国主义思想以及负责协商统一筹划办理有关西藏地方建设和其他应当办而又可能办的事宜。
    一年来，由于中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的领导与亲切关怀，由于达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼的直接领导；由于全体干部和工作人员尤其是藏族干部和工作人员，以及僧俗人民的团结、合作与共同努力；西藏自治区筹备委员会的工作是作得有成绩的。做了许多有益于西藏民族政治、经济、文化发展的工作。进一步密切了中央与西藏地方以及西藏民族内部各方面的关系，并对进一步加强民族间和西藏民族内部的团结与西藏人民爱国主义思想的增长，均起了积极的作用，在医疗、防疫、救灾、修建等项具体工作上也取得了一定的成绩。所有这些，都充分说明了西藏自治区筹备委员会对西藏民族的团结、进步和发展有着不容忽视的促进作用。因而，西藏自治区筹备委员会受到祖国其他兄弟民族的赞助和西藏广大人民群众的日益拥护；所以我们肯定地说：西藏自治区筹备委员会在当前是符合西藏具体情况的一个好的组织形式，也是西藏民族过渡到区域自治的一个好的组织形式，它的成立是必要的，也是适时的。
    一年来，我们的工作是有成绩的；但在工作中也是有缺点、有错误的。去年在西藏自治区筹备委员会成立的大会上提出西藏要走社会主义道路，逐步进行民主改革，这个方向是正确的。但是由于对西藏地区的主、客观情况全面的分析研究不够，过早的着手了民主改革的准备工作，有些摊子铺的大了一些。我们在筹备委员会的工作过程中，有些地方协商不够，没有充分发挥藏族干部的积极性与主动性，使某些工作受到了一定的影响。这些缺点、错误，都必须在今后工作中予以坚决克服。
    关于西藏的民主改革问题。西藏民族同祖国其他兄弟民族一样是要走社会主义道路的。只有这样，才能使西藏民族的政治、经济、文化有高度的发展，才能使西藏民族永远摆脱贫困与落后的状态，但是在西藏地区实现和平改革是需要具备一定条件的。譬如人民群众的改革要求，上层人士拥护改革等等。目前，这些条件还不完全具备。因此，中央确定：西藏地区的民主改革，第二个五年计划期间不予进行，第三个五年计划期间是否改革，将根据当时情况由西藏民族领袖、代表人物和人民共同协商决定，这样，就对将来走和平改革的道路，提供了更大的可能性。
    西藏地区今后六年内是不进行民主改革的。根据这一情况，过去为了准备进行民主改革而增设的机构就自然需要进行适当的收缩，前来帮助西藏民族准备进行民主改革的汉族工作人员亦要相应的调走一部分去参加祖国其他地区的社会主义建设工作。当前我们正在进行的紧缩机构，调动一部分人员返回内地工作，就是为了这个原因。
    当我们纪念筹委会成立一周年的时候，我们要知道，筹委会的每一工作成就对西藏民族团结、进步和发展，对祖国的建设事业都是有贡献的。同时，我们也要知道，西藏民族愈团结，愈进步，帝国主义分子也就愈会以各种不同的形式从多方面来进行造谣中伤，挑拨破坏。因此，我们要更加亲密的团结起来，团结在反帝爱国的旗帜下，继续做好筹委会的工作，进一步做好民族间的团结和西藏民族内部的团结工作，加强爱国主义的宣传教育，逐步认真的执行“关于和平解放西藏办法的协议”和自治区筹委会本身的各项工作任务，并且时刻警惕帝国主义分子的颠覆活动和分离主义分子背叛祖国的活动。最后，让我们在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的领导下，在达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼以及中共西藏工委的直接领导下，为巩固祖国统一，为西藏民族的更加团结、进步和发展而共同奋斗。
