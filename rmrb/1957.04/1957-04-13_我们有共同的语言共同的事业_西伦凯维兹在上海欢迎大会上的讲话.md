Dear Comrade Mayor, Dear Comrade Party Secretary, Dear Citizens of Shanghai, Our Friends:

When I stand here and speak to you—our friends—I feel regret that I cannot speak to you in a language you can understand. Nevertheless, we can still understand each other. Because, we have the common language of friendship, the language of unity, the language of building socialism, and the common language of striving for world peace.

I would like to extend my heartfelt respect to you—the citizens of Shanghai—on behalf of the Polish people, and wish you, the Chinese people, continuous victories in the cause of building socialism, and wish the People's Republic of China increasing prosperity.

The city of Shanghai has long been known to the Polish people and the Polish working class. Many years ago, we constantly heard about the heroic struggles of the citizens of Shanghai against the colonialists. We have long known that Shanghai is one of the leading cities in the Chinese people's struggle for liberation.

The Polish working class knows that the awakening of the Shanghai working class and the people of Shanghai, and the Shanghai working class's struggle for liberation, symbolizes the awakening of the Chinese people and the Chinese people's struggle for liberation. Therefore, please allow me, on behalf of the Polish United Workers' Party and the Polish people, to extend my heartfelt respect to the people of Shanghai, who have revolutionary and freedom traditions.

We, the Polish people, lost our freedom for more than one hundred and fifty years, and the Polish people have been constantly fighting for freedom. Thirteen years ago, after enduring Hitler's aggression and oppression, the Polish people finally gained independence and liberation. In this struggle for liberation, the Polish people lost and sacrificed one-fifth of their population, and now they can finally embark on the road to building a new life.

Every people who are fighting for freedom, every country and people who are building socialism, are friends of the Polish people. Therefore, the Chinese people and China are one of Poland's best friends.

I hope you believe that your warm welcome to the Polish people's delegation is the same as the warm welcome of the Polish people to the liberation of Shanghai by the Chinese People's Liberation Army in 1949. Since then, the colonialists have been driven out of Shanghai and out of China. The Chinese people have begun to build their new life.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, Poland has established friendly and cooperative relations with her. The Polish people, like the Chinese people, know very well how important the establishment of the People's Republic of China is for the national liberation struggle of Asian and African countries and for the strengthening of the socialist camp.

We have been working hard to establish close friendly and cooperative relations with China. Now, there is a Chinese-Polish shipping company, and ships from the port of Gdańsk are constantly sailing to Shanghai. We are cooperating economically, we have close cultural exchanges, and we also have close coordination and cooperation politically. In the struggle for world peace, we are all making common efforts. We are satisfied and fortunate with our cooperation with China. We have come to great China to see your victories and achievements for ourselves, and to convey to you, the citizens of New China, the deep affection and friendship of the Polish people for you. We are particularly happy to be able to visit Shanghai, because we know that Shanghai plays an important role in China's economic development. Because Shanghai has considerable heavy and light industries, and a strong working class, it plays a very important role in China's development. The responsible comrades of Shanghai have introduced a lot of this to us today.

We are deeply impressed by your socialist construction. We believe that you can quickly eliminate the backward conditions that the colonialists have left you for many years.

When the Chinese people were fighting for freedom, they had the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. As in the past, today in socialist construction, the Chinese people have the leadership of the wise, long-tempered, and experienced Chinese Communist Party, with the theoretical guidance of Marxism-Leninism, and the creative development of Marxism-Leninism. This party is headed by Comrade Mao Zedong. You are very fortunate to have such a party and such party leaders.

We are deeply impressed by the close unity of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. The Chinese workers, peasants, intellectuals, and patriotic bourgeoisie are working together for the prosperity and development of the People's China.

We will definitely convey the warm welcome and friendship shown to the Polish delegation to the Polish people and the Polish working class, so that they will understand that the Chinese working class, peasants, and intellectuals are the best friends of the Polish people.

I don't know how to describe the enthusiasm with which you gathered here today to welcome the Polish delegation. Thank you for your warm welcome. We will continue to work hard to strengthen the friendship between the Polish and Chinese people, strengthen our socialist construction, and strengthen the socialist family. We will continue to cooperate and work with you to strive for peace.

Long live Sino-Polish friendship!
Long live the People's China!
Long live the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong!
Long live the great unity of socialist countries striving for progress and world peace!
We salute all the citizens of Shanghai!

    我们有共同的语言共同的事业
    西伦凯维兹在上海欢迎大会上的讲话亲爱的市长同志亲爱的党书记同志亲爱的上海市民，我们的朋友们：
    当我站在这里，和你们——我们的朋友们讲话的时候，我感到很遗憾，因为我不能用你们能够听懂的语言向你们讲话。虽然如此，我们还是可以互相了解的。因为，我们有着共同的友谊的语言，团结的语言，建设社会主义的语言，争取世界和平的共同语言。
    我想代表波兰人民向你们——上海的市民们致以衷心的敬意，祝你们，祝中国人民在建设社会主义的事业中不断获得胜利，祝中华人民共和国日益繁荣。
    上海这个城市，在很久以前就为波兰人民、波兰工人阶级所知道，在许多年以前，我们就不断听到过上海市民们与殖民主义者所进行的英勇斗争。我们早就知道，上海是中国人民争取解放的斗争中带头的城市之一。
    波兰工人阶级知道上海工人阶级和上海人民的觉醒、上海工人阶级争取解放的斗争，就象征着中国人民的觉醒，中国人民争取解放的斗争。因此，请允许我代表波兰统一工人党，代表波兰人民向具有革命传统和自由传统的上海人民致以衷心的敬意。
    我们波兰人民曾经在一百五十多年的期间里失去了自由，波兰人民一直不断地为争取自由而进行斗争。十三年以前，在经受了希特勒的侵略和压迫以后，波兰人民终于获得了独立和解放。在这个解放斗争中，波兰人民失去了、牺牲了五分之一的人口，现在终于能够走向建设新生活的道路。
    每一个进行争取自由斗争的人民，每一个建设社会主义的国家和人民，都是波兰人民的朋友，因此，中国人民、中国是波兰最好的朋友之一。
    希望你们相信，你们现在这样热烈欢迎波兰人民的代表团，是和波兰人民在1949年热烈地欢迎中国人民解放军解放上海是一样的。从那时起，殖民主义者就被赶出了上海，赶出了中国。中国人民开始建设自己的新生活。
    自从中华人民共和国成立以后，波兰就和她建立了友好合作的关系。波兰人民正和中国人民一样，很好地知道中华人民共和国的建立对于亚非国家的争取民族解放斗争，对于社会主义阵营的加强有着多么巨大的意义。
    我们一直在努力和中国建立密切的友好合作的关系。现在，有着中国和波兰的轮船公司，从格丹尼亚港不断有船只驶向上海。我们在经济上进行着合作，我们有着密切的文化交流，在政治上我们也有着密切的配合和合作，在争取世界和平的斗争中，我们都进行着共同的努力。我们对于和中国的合作感到满意，并且是感到幸运的。我们到伟大的中国来，就是为了亲自来看一看你们的胜利和成就，就是为了向你们，向新中国的公民们，转达波兰人民对你们的深厚感情和友谊。我们对于能到上海参观访问，感到特别的高兴，因为我们知道上海这个城市在中国的经济发展上有着重要的作用。由于上海有着相当大的重工业、轻工业，有着强大的工人阶级，它对于中国的发展有着很重要的作用。这些，上海的负责同志们今天给我们介绍了很多。
    对于你们的社会主义建设，我们感到十分钦佩。我们相信你们能够迅速地消除多年来殖民主义者给你们留下的落后的状况。
    在中国人民进行争取自由斗争的时候，有着中国共产党的领导。和过去一样，今天在社会主义建设中，中国人民有英明的、经过长期锻炼的、有着丰富经验的中国共产党的领导，有着以马克思列宁主义为理论指导，并且创造性地发挥了马克思列宁主义的中国共产党的领导。这个党是以毛泽东同志为首的。你们有着这样的党，这样的党的领袖们，你们是十分幸运的。
    对于中国人民在中国共产党领导下的紧密团结，我们感到十分敬佩。中国的工人、农民、知识分子、爱国资产阶级正团结一致地为了人民中国的繁荣发展而进行着努力。
    我们一定把你们给予波兰代表团的热烈欢迎和表现的友谊转达给波兰人民、波兰工人阶级，使他们了解中国的工人阶级、农民、知识分子是波兰人民的最好的朋友。
    我不知道应该怎样来描述今天你们聚集在这里来欢迎波兰代表团的热情。谢谢你们给与我们的热烈欢迎。我们将继续努力加强波兰人民和中国人民的友谊，加强我们的社会主义建设、加强社会主义大家庭。我们将和你们一道继续为争取和平而进行合作和努力。
    中波友谊万岁！
    人民中国万岁！
    以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党万岁！
    争取进步和世界和平的社会主义国家大团结万岁！
    我们向所有的上海市民们致意！
