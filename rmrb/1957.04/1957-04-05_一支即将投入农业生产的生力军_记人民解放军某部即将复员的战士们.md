    A Vigorous New Force About to be Invested in Agricultural Production
    —A Record of Soldiers of a Certain Unit of the People's Liberation Army About to be Demobilized
    Shi Feng
    Just as the nation's peasants are racking their brains to strive for a bumper agricultural harvest this year, the Chinese People's Liberation Army will have a large number of excellent soldiers demobilized and return to their hometowns in batches this year to invest in agricultural production. This batch of demobilized servicemen will be a great supporting force for the increase in agricultural production throughout the country.
    In order to understand the situation of the demobilized personnel, I went to the demobilized personnel training corps of a certain unit. Three thousand and twenty-two demobilized personnel are studying various policies and knowledge related to rural work here.
    The demobilized personnel are all young and strong. Over the past few years, they have all undergone strict and regular military training, and some have even been tested by war. They have all become strong soldiers who can skillfully master the weapons in their hands to defend the motherland. Now, when the motherland needs them to be demobilized, everyone has many feelings. One day, I went to participate in a class discussion, and heard the soldiers talking about the training and progress they had made in the past few years. Hu Sichun, who had been awarded a second-class merit, said: "In the past few years, how much time, energy, and money have the Party and superiors spent in training us to become soldiers who are capable in both literary and military skills. When I first joined the army, I didn't know what politics was, but now I understand many revolutionary principles, my class consciousness has been raised, and I have joined the Communist Party; in the military, I couldn't even stand at attention or stand at ease, but now I have learned military technology; in culture, I couldn't even write a letter home, but now I have improved to the level of senior primary school, and can write short articles of about a thousand words... Looking back, the current me is completely different from the me before joining the army. Thinking of this, I have unspeakable gratitude to the Party!" His words expressed the common feelings of the soldiers. Yes, the People's Liberation Army, this great school, has, in a few years, cultivated them from ordinary peasants into excellent revolutionary soldiers. Among them, there are 1,630 Communist Party members and 1,138 Communist Youth League members; 1,000 have been credited for their achievements in combat, work, and study, and 1,795 have received various awards such as commendations before the team, circular commendations, material rewards, and taking photos in front of the military flag, many of whom have received several or even more than ten awards; in addition, 170 have been awarded the title of advanced worker, 584 have been awarded the title of excellent shooter, and 368 have been awarded the title of technical expert.
    Regular training has not only taught them the skills to defend the motherland, but also cultivated many valuable qualities in them. I saw such advantages written on the appraisal of many soldiers: "Never flinching in the face of difficulties," "Not afraid of hardship or fatigue in military exercises," "Cherishing weapons more than their own bodies," "Never having personal problems."
    Looking at the improvement of their cultural level is also exciting. The Seventh Company of the regiment has a total of 217 people, with 112 illiterates, 95 with a junior primary school level, and 10 with a senior primary school level. Now, except for 5 of the original illiterates who have not participated in cultural studies because they have been participating in the construction of barracks and transportation work for a long time, the others have improved: 102 have reached the equivalent of junior primary school level, 106 have reached the equivalent of senior primary school level, and 4 have reached the equivalent of junior high school level. After they initially mastered the key to culture, they became even more fond of learning. For example, Sergeant Qin Xuehao has read a large number of books in the past few years, including popular theoretical books such as dialectical materialism. During the break time, I also saw a soldier who originally did not even know his own name reading the novel "Defend Yan'an" with great interest. He said that there were very few words in the book that he did not recognize.
    These excellent veterans have played an active role in the construction of the company and in leading new soldiers in the past few years. Wang Jiayin, the deputy platoon leader and sergeant of the engineering detachment, used waste wood to make more than 20 teaching models when teaching new soldiers bridge building, city construction, and other techniques, in order to make it easier for the new soldiers to understand. As expected, the new soldiers understood it at a glance, so he was selected to attend the unit's activists' conference. Squad leader Dong Enting created a "red flag automatic target reporter" that can check whether the shooter's gun is steady in order to improve the effect of the soldiers' shooting preview, which improved the soldiers' interest in previewing. Now this target reporter has been widely promoted in the unit. Qin Xuehao, the heavy machine gun squad leader, was meticulous in his help and care for the new soldiers. He often thought of his feelings when he was a new recruit, so when he saw that the new soldiers were not used to military life when they first arrived, he patiently guided them. When he saw that they had made a little progress, he praised and encouraged them. In training, he organized veteran soldiers to tutor new soldiers. With his patient and sincere help, the soldiers were able to actively and earnestly study hard. In this way, everyone in the squad he led won the honorary title of "excellent shooter," and everyone received two or more awards. There are many, many good squad leaders and good soldiers like the ones mentioned above in the demobilized personnel training corps. When they left the company, many officers and soldiers shed tears because they were reluctant to let them leave; they themselves also shed tears because they were reluctant to leave the army that had educated and cultivated them, their superiors, and their comrades-in-arms who were like brothers.
    In order to fulfill their responsibilities to the people to the end, the demobilized soldiers did a lot of work until the last day before leaving the team. For example, Zhou Chuanjia, the armorer who was constantly commended, explained in detail the decomposition and wiping methods of various weapons to the new soldiers who joined the army this year; Feng Binghe was good at carpentry, and when he saw that the company lacked aiming tripods, he used waste wood to make 61 tripods, and when he saw that the club lacked ping-pong tables, he rushed to make one, which moved the comrades who stayed in the team very much.
    When the superiors asked the demobilized personnel to actively participate in agricultural production after returning to their hometowns, everyone said: "In the past, the Party needed us to be soldiers to defend the motherland, which was our honor; today, the Party needs us to return to the countryside to build a new socialist countryside, which is also our honor." In the regimental headquarters, battalion headquarters, and company headquarters of the demobilized personnel training corps, guarantee letters and letters of determination sent by the demobilized personnel were constantly received: the soldiers expressed their determination to achieve three "backbones," that is, they were "backbones" in the past in troop training, they would be "backbones" in building a new socialist countryside when they returned home, and they would also be "backbones" when the country needed them to return to the team to participate in combat in the future. Everyone is enthusiastically discussing how to maintain their honor after returning to their hometowns, and how to become a model demobilized soldier. Everyone is preparing to invest their production assistance funds in cooperatives. Bi Yushan said: "I plan not to add cotton clothes and unlined clothes for three years, and not to buy shoes for two years, and invest the production assistance funds in cooperatives to expand production." A sergeant thought that the people in his hometown were all bald, so in order not to appear special after returning to his hometown and to integrate with the masses, he shaved his parted hair. Although these are very small things, they show how real the soldiers' determination is!
    The demobilized personnel also seriously discussed how to overcome the various difficulties they might encounter after returning to their hometowns. They all felt that it was a big change from holding a gun for a long time to holding a hoe, and there would be some difficulties. But they said: "These difficulties are much smaller than learning military technology when we first joined the army. As long as we learn from the masses with an open mind, we will definitely be able to overcome the difficulties!" Some comrades have no relatives or houses in their hometowns, and they have difficulties in eating and lodging after returning. Although this requires the government and the masses to give them appropriate arrangements and care, they all said that they should rely on themselves to solve any difficulties that they can solve. Some comrades whose homes are in disaster areas have expressed their great aspirations to transform their hometowns together with the masses.
    In order to do a good job and engage in production after returning to their hometowns, almost everyone bought small books such as "How to Be a Good Cooperative Member," "The Responsibilities of Rural Party Members," "The Self-Cultivation of Rural Youth," "How to Be a Model Demobilized Soldier," and "Model Regulations for Advanced Cooperatives," as well as small books introducing the experience of agricultural cooperatives. Some people bought several copies, and some bought twenty or thirty copies. Some comrades are planning to raise pigs after returning home and bought books on raising pigs. Others bought scripts such as "Farmer's Daughter" and rural performance materials, preparing to carry out rural cultural and recreational activities after returning. Some people bought "Common Sense of Women's Hygiene" and "Common Sense of Infant Care" for their wives, planning to make their families live a happier and more fulfilling life. Everyone is confidently preparing to welcome a new life!

    一支即将投入农业生产的生力军
    ——记人民解放军某部即将复员的战士们
    石峰
    正当全国农民想尽一切办法为争取今年农业大丰收而奋斗的时候，中国人民解放军在今年将有大批优秀的士兵分批复员回乡，投入农业生产。这批复员军人对全国的农业增产，将是一个很大的支持力量。
    为了了解复员人员的情况，我到了某部队的复员人员集训团。有三千零二十二名复员人员正在这里学习有关农村工作的各项政策和知识。
    复员人员都年轻力壮。几年来，他们都经过了严格的正规的军事训练，有一些人还经过了战争的考验。他们都已经成为能够熟练地掌握手中武器保卫祖国的坚强战士了。现在，当祖国需要他们复员的时候，每一个人都有许多的感想。有一天，我去参加班里的讨论会，听到战士们都在谈论几年来所得到的锻炼和进步。立过二等功的胡思春说：“几年来，党和上级用了多少时间、精力和金钱，把我们培养成为一个能文能武的战士。我刚入伍的时候，不知道什么叫政治，现在懂得了许多革命道理，阶级觉悟提高了，并且参加了共产党；在军事上，本来连立正稍息都不会，现在学会了军事技术；在文化上，本来连一封家信都写不成，现在已提高到高小程度，会写一千字左右的短文章，……回想起来，现在的我和入伍以前的我完全不一样了。想到这些，我对党有说不出的感激！”他的话，说出了士兵们共同的心情。是的，人民解放军这座大学校，已经在几年的时间里，把他们从普通的农民培养成为优秀的革命战士。在他们当中，共有共产党员一千六百三十人，青年团员一千一百三十八人；在战斗、工作和学习中立过功的有一千人，受到过队前嘉奖、通令嘉奖、物质奖励和军旗前照相等各种奖励的有一千七百九十五人，其中有许多人获得几次以至十多次奖励；此外，还有一百七十人获得先进工作者、五百八十四人获得优秀射手、三百六十八人获得技术能手等荣誉称号。
    正规训练不仅教会了他们保卫祖国的本领，也培养了他们许多宝贵的品质。我看到许多战士的鉴定上写着这样的优点：“在困难面前从来不畏缩”，“在军事演习中不怕苦不怕累”，“爱护武器重于自己的身体”，“从来没有闹过个人问题”。
    再看看他们文化程度提高的情况，也是令人兴奋的。该团七连共有二百一十七个人，原有文盲一百一十二人，初小程度的九十五人，高小程度的十人。现在除原来是文盲的五人因为长期参加修建营房、担任运输工作，没有参加文化学习，仍然是文盲以外，其他人都有了提高：相当初小程度的已有一百零二人，相当高小程度的已有一百零六人，相当初中程度的有四人。他们初步掌握了文化钥匙以后，更加热爱学习了。例如上士秦学好在几年中看了大量的书籍，包括辩证唯物主义等通俗理论书籍。在休息时间里，我还看到一个原来连自己名字都不认识的战士正在兴味浓厚地阅读小说“保卫延安”，他说书里不认识的字很少。
    这批优秀的老战士，几年来在连队的建设和带领新战士方面都起了积极的作用。工兵分队的副排长、上士汪家银在给新战士讲授架桥、筑城等技术的时候，为了使新战士容易理解，利用废木料制作了二十多件教学模型，果然使新战士一看就明了，他因而被选拔出席了部队的积极分子大会。班长董恩亭为了提高战士射击预习的效果，创造了一种可以检查射手举枪是否平稳的“红旗自动报靶器”，提高了战士们预习的兴趣，现在这种报靶器已在该部队普遍推广。重机枪班长秦学好，对新战士的帮助、体贴无微不至，他常常想到自己当新兵时的心情，所以看到新战士刚来不习惯军队生活，就耐心地引导他们，看到他们有一点进步，就加以表扬和鼓励；在训练中，他组织老战士辅导新战士。战士们在他耐心诚恳的帮助下，也都能积极认真地勤学苦练，这样，在他领导的班里，每一个人都获得了“优秀射手”的荣誉称号，每一个人都受到了二次以上的奖励。像上面这样的好班长、好战士，在复员人员集训团里是很多很多的。当他们离开连队的时候，许多军官和士兵因为舍不得他们离开而流泪；他们自己呢，也因为舍不得教育和培养了他们的军队，他们的上级和亲如兄弟的战友而掉下了眼泪。
    复员的士兵为了最后尽到自己对人民的责任，直到离队前的最后一天，还做了许多工作。例如不断受到嘉奖的军械员周传家给今年入伍的新战士详细讲解了各种武器的分解和擦拭方法；冯丙和会木工手艺，他看到连队里缺少瞄准用的三角架，就利用废木料做了六十一个三角架，看到俱乐部里缺少乒乓球桌子，又赶做了一个，使留队的同志非常感动。
    当上级要求复员人员回乡积极参加农业生产的时候，大家都表示：“过去党需要我们作一个战士保卫祖国，这是我们的光荣；今天党需要我们回到农村去建设新农村，同样是我们的光荣。”在复员人员集训团的团部、营部、连部里，不断收到复员人员送来的保证书和决心书：士兵们表示决心做到三个“骨干”，即过去在部队训练中是“骨干”，回家建设社会主义新农村是“骨干”，将来国家一旦有事需要归队参加战斗的时候也是“骨干”。大家都在热烈地讨论着回乡以后怎样才能保持自己的荣誉，怎样才能成为一个模范的复员军人。每一个人都准备把自己的生产资助金投入合作社，毕玉山说：“我准备三年不添棉衣和单衣，两年不买鞋子，把生产资助金投入合作社扩大生产。”有一个军士想到自己家乡的人都是光头的，为了回乡后不显得特殊，与群众打成一片，就把自己的分头剃了。这些虽然是很细小的事情，但看出战士们的决心多么真实！
    复员人员也认真地讨论着怎样克服回乡以后可能遇到的各种困难。他们都感到从长期拿枪杆转到拿锄头，这是一个很大的转变，会有一些困难。但是他们说：“这些困难比刚入伍时学习军事技术要小得多，只要虚心向群众学习，就一定能克服困难！”有些同志家乡没有亲人，没有房屋，回去后吃饭住宿都有困难，这些虽然要靠政府和群众给他们以适当的安排和照顾，但是他们都表示凡是自己可以解决的困难就要靠自己去解决。有些家在灾区的同志都表示了要和群众一起改造自己家乡的宏愿。
    他们为了回乡后做好工作，搞好生产，几乎每一个人都买了“怎样做个好社员”、“农村党员的责任”、“农村青年的修养”、“怎样做一个模范复员军人”、“高级社示范章程”等小册子和介绍农业合作社经验的小册子，有人买了几本，有人买了二、三十本。有的同志准备回家养猪，买了关于养猪的书。还有的同志买了“农家女儿”等剧本和农村演唱材料，准备回去开展农村文娱活动。有的人给妻子买了“妇女卫生常识”、“育婴常识”，打算让自己的家庭过得更幸福更美满。他们每一个人都满怀信心地准备迎接新的生活！
