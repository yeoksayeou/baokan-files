Also on Mirrors
Huang Miaozi

I was very interested after reading Comrade Gao Shiqi's "The Story of Mirrors."

Even if you put China's oldest mirror in front of you, few people would recognize it. It was originally just a bronze basin, and you had to fill it with water to see your face. This kind of mirror was called a "jian" around 2,500 years ago. The left side of the character "jian" indicates that it is a metal object, and the right side is the character "jian" (监), which in ancient writing symbolizes a person opening one big eye and looking at their reflection in the water in the basin, like this "?". Zhuangzi once said, "No one looks at their face in flowing water, but they do in still water." Because the water in the basin has to be still to see one's true face clearly.

However, this oldest kind of mirror wasn't very convenient. It couldn't be hung on the wall, nor was it easy to hold upright, and you could easily splash water all over yourself. Therefore, flat bronze mirrors were invented. When did bronze mirrors actually appear? Past scholars suggested the earliest period was around 2,200 years ago, during the Warring States period, but Chinese archaeologists have excavated bronze objects similar to mirrors from the Yin dynasty ruins, dating back about 3,000 years. This may be the ancestor of the Chinese bronze mirror recently discovered in Okayama, Japan, as reported.

China's mirror industry began to develop during the Warring States period. "Miscellaneous Records of the Western Capital" says that Emperor Qin Shi Huang had a mirror that could see a person's internal organs. This is, of course, a myth, as X-ray vision didn't exist at that time. But later, people who were clear in their judgment were described with the idiom "Qin mirror hangs high."

During the Han dynasty, roughly 2,000 to 1,700 years ago, due to the development of metallurgy and handicrafts, mirrors of extremely high quality were produced. Artists painted four gods (Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and a tortoise called "Xuanwu"), fairy tales of the Eastern Prince and Western Queen Mother, and historical stories such as King Fucha of Wu and the loyal minister Wu Zixu, Confucius and Rong Qiqi... on the mirrors. They also engraved rhyming inscriptions, such as: "Shangfang made a mirror, truly excellent, on it are immortals who do not age; they thirstily drink sweet springs and hungrily eat jujubes, floating freely under heaven and roaming the four seas." "The barbarians are exterminated, the world submits, the wind and rain are timely, and the five grains ripen." Some mirrors even had engravings of new things imported from foreign countries at the time, such as the heavenly horses and grapes brought back from the west by Emperor Wu of Han's generals.

Han dynasty bronze mirrors were mainly cast from alloys of copper, tin, and aluminum. Danyang (west of Yichuan County, Shaanxi) was the most famous place for producing the main raw material, copper, during the Han dynasty. Mirrors often had inscriptions such as "Han has good copper from Danyang, mixed with silver and tin, clear and bright." Some people believe that mercury was already used in Han dynasty mirrors, which is related to the chemical experiments of alchemists during the Han dynasty in burning cinnabar and refining mercury. The Venetians began making glass mirrors by coating one side of the glass with an alloy of mercury and tin. Although our ancestors did not use glass around 2,000 years ago, mercury alloys may have been used long ago. "Tiangong Kaiwu," a famous Chinese scientific work written in 1637, mentioned mirrors and said, "The surface becomes bright because mercury adheres to the body (of the mirror), not because the copper has such brightness."

The production of bronze mirrors in the Tang dynasty was even more exquisite, and the patterns were particularly rich and beautiful. Those who study Chinese arts and crafts highly cherish the bronze mirrors of the Han and Tang dynasties. Emperor Taizong of Tang, Li Shimin, once compared his loyal minister Wei Zheng to a "human mirror," saying, "Use history as a mirror to see success and failure, use copper as a mirror to know beauty and ugliness, and use people as a mirror to know good and evil." By the middle and late Tang dynasty, the rulers became increasingly extravagant. The mirrors used in the court were cast by workers gathered by the prefect of Yangzhou on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month in the middle of the Yangtze River. Therefore, the poet Bai Juyi wrote the moving satirical poem "Hundred-Refined Mirror." The last section of the poem reads: "Everyone calls it the Emperor's Mirror, but I have a word for Emperor Taizong: Taizong always used people as a mirror, to reflect on the past and present, not to admire his appearance. The safety of the world is in his grasp, the governance and chaos of hundreds of kings are in his heart. I know that the Emperor has another mirror, not the hundred-refined bronze of Yangzhou!"

Just like the "human mirror," bronze mirrors sometimes do not necessarily reflect reality clearly. The Tang dynasty poet Liu Yuxi once saw ten boxed mirrors in the market. He opened one and found it reflected people very clearly, but when he opened the other nine, they were all blurry. Liu Yuxi sighed at the poor skills of the mirror maker, but the reply he received was that there was only one person in ten who had a truly beautiful face and needed to buy a clear mirror. These blurry wares were prepared for the majority who were unwilling to seriously discover their own shortcomings. Liu Yuxi then wrote the "Obscure Mirror Poem" with emotion: "Flaws are unseen, beauty arises at will, gazing four or five times a day, proclaiming beauty that overturns cities!"

Unlike those discovered in Egypt, Chinese bronze mirrors rarely had handles for holding, except for "dancing mirrors" used for performance. The middle of the back of the mirror had a knob. By threading a rope through it, it could be held. During the Song dynasty, mirrors were colloquially called "zhaozi." Recently, a Song dynasty tomb unearthed in Guangzhou revealed a mirror engraved with "Zhaizi of Nian Er Shu, Zhen Shi family, Huzhou." Bronze mirrors were used for a long time in China. Ming dynasty novels also describe the polishing of bronze mirrors. During this long period, the material and form of mirrors constantly changed, until after the 17th century when glass mirrors replaced bronze mirrors in China.

Humanity's continuous efforts in culture and science have made the world change with each passing day. Mirrors, such ordinary tools for "washing faces and blackening (silvering) the back," contain rich cultural and historical stories. (Attached image)

    也谈镜子
    黄苗子
    看了高士奇同志写的“镜子的故事”，很感兴趣。
    我国最古的镜子即使放在你面前，也许很少人认得它，原来它只是一个青铜盆，要装上水才照得见面孔。这种镜子在二千五百年前后叫做“鉴”，“鉴”字的左边说明它是金属物，右边是“监”字，照古代人的写法象征一个人睁着一只大眼睛对着盆子里的水照自己的影子。如“?”。“庄子”里曾经说：“没有人在流动的水上照面孔却在静止的水上照。”因为盆里的水不动才能看清楚自己的本来面目。
    可是这种最古的镜子不太好用，它既不能挂在墙上，也不好竖着拿，一不留神还泼你一身一脸水。因此平面的，青铜做的镜子便发明出来。青铜镜到底是什么时候才有的呢？过去的学者们举出最古的时代是距今二千二百年左右的战国，但是我国的考古工作者却从距今三千年左右的殷代遗址中挖掘出类似镜子的铜器。这可能就是最近报载日本冈山市发现的中国青铜镜的老祖宗。
    我国镜子工业在战国时代开始发达，“西京杂记”里说秦始皇有一只能照见人的内脏的镜子这当然是神话，那时还没有X光透视。可是以后对于判断事理明白的人们，就有句成语说他“秦镜高悬”。
    距今约二千年至一千七百年的汉代，由于冶金工业和手工艺的发达，制造出水平极高的镜子出来。工艺美术家在镜子上画着四神（青龙、白虎、朱雀、和叫做“玄武”的乌龟）、东王公和西王母等神仙故事，画着吴王夫差和忠臣伍子胥、孔子和荣启期等历史故事……并且刻上一些有韵的铭文，如：“尚方作镜真大好，上有仙人不知老；渴饮甘泉饥食枣，浮游天下遨四海。”“胡虏殄灭天下服，风雨时节五谷熟。”等句子。有些镜子还刻着当时从外国输入的新鲜事物，如汉武帝的将军们从西方带回来的天马和葡萄。
    汉代的铜镜主要是用铜、锡和铝等合金铸成，镜子的主要原料铜的产地，在汉代以丹阳（陕西宜川县西）为最著名。镜子上常有“汉有善铜出丹阳，和以银锡清且明”等铭文。有人认为汉代的镜子就已经用水银，这和汉代道家方士们烧丹炼汞（水银）的化学实验有关。威尼斯人开始做玻璃镜是在玻璃的一面涂上水银和汞的合金，我们的祖先在距今二千年左右虽然没有用玻璃，但是汞合金可能早就用上。作于1637年的我国科学名著“天工开物”提到镜子，曾说：“开面成光，则水银附体而成，非铜有光明如许也。”
    唐代青铜镜的制作更加精美，花纹图案也特别富丽，研究中国工艺美术的人们都异常珍视汉、唐的铜镜。唐太宗李世民曾经把他的忠臣魏征比做“人镜”，说：“以古为镜见成败，以铜为镜知美丑，以人为镜知善恶。”到了中、晚唐时代，统治者奢侈日甚，宫庭所用的镜子由扬州的刺史集中了工人五月五日那天在扬子江心铸造，因此诗人白居易曾写过“百炼镜”这一首动人的讽刺诗。诗的末段写道：“人人呼为天子镜，我有一言闻太宗，太宗常以人为镜，鉴古鉴今不鉴容。四海安危居掌内，百王治乱悬心中。乃知天子别有镜，不是扬州百炼铜！”
    正如“人镜”一样，铜镜有时也不一定把真实反映得很鲜明。唐代诗人刘禹锡有一次在市场上看见十个带盒的镜子，打开一个来看，照人十分清楚，但是当他再打开其他九个看时，却都是模模糊糊的。刘禹锡叹息镜工的技术太差，可是得到的答复却是世界上真正有漂亮面孔而需要买一个清楚的镜子的人到底十个人中不到一个，这些模糊的货色正是为了多数不肯认真去发现自己的缺点的人准备的。刘禹锡便感慨地写了一首“瑕疵既不见，妍态随意生，一日四五照，自言美倾城！”的“昏镜词”。
    我国铜镜和埃及发现的不一样，除了表演用的“舞镜”之外，很少有手拿的柄。镜背的中部有一个纽，穿上一根绳子就可以拿。宋代俗话叫镜子做“照子”，最近广州出土的宋墓里就发现刻着“湖州真石家念二叔照子”的镜子。铜镜在我国使用的时间很长，明代小说中也描写磨铜镜的事。这个漫长期间，镜子的质料和形式都在不断变化中，一直到十七世纪以后，我国才有玻璃镜来代替铜镜。
    人类在文化科学上的不断努力，使得世界日新月异，镜子这样平凡的“洗脸刷黑”用具，却包涵着丰富的文化历史故事。（附图片）
