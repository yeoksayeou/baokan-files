Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, April 22nd: Leadership organs at all levels in Hebei Province are currently educating cadres of agricultural cooperatives to strengthen unity and improve production, in order to overcome the contradictions arising from the strained relations between new and old cadres following the rectification of the cooperatives.

Following the widespread rectification of over 30,000 agricultural cooperatives in Hebei Province, some of the cadres of the cooperatives and teams who were voted out of office or demoted harbor resentment. Some are disheartened and refuse to work; others are dissatisfied with the new cadres and are not actively helping them; still others are afraid of being ridiculed by the commune members and want to move out of the village. Among the newly elected cadres, some lack a comprehensive understanding of the achievements and shortcomings of the old cadres. The contradictions between new and old cadres are affecting the further consolidation of agricultural cooperatives.

In response to the above situation, leadership organs at all levels in Hebei Province have adopted a policy of unity and education towards the cadres of agricultural cooperatives. The Cang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party studied and summarized the experiences of key counties in this regard and promoted them to other counties. The Jiahe County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party conducted a survey and categorized the unity of new and old cadres in all agricultural cooperatives in the county, and adopted appropriate solutions. This county held forums for defeated candidates at the township level. At the meeting, leading cadres talked with the defeated candidates, solicited opinions, affirmed their achievements, criticized their shortcomings, and helped them dispel ideological concerns. Three former cooperative directors of Gao Village Township who were previously negative in production have become active after attending the symposium. For the one hundred and ninety-eight cooperative cadres who were demoted and had low morale, county work team members were assigned to educate them individually. As a result, most of them have also become active. At the same time, after conducting persuasive education among commune members, appropriate arrangements were made for a small number of cooperative cadres who were voted out of office due to being manipulated by bad elements. The county also held forums for new and old cadres, chaired by the CCP branch, at the village level, allowing them to exchange work information and experience, and to educate them on unity.

    河北省各地领导机关采取团结教育的方针
    改善新旧社干部不融洽的关系
    新华社保定22日电　河北省各地领导机关正在教育农业社的干部加强团结，搞好生产，克服整社后新、旧干部关系不融洽的矛盾。
    河北省三万多个农业社普遍整顿以后，在落选和下放的社、队干部中有一部分人抱有抵触情绪。他们有的灰心丧气，躺倒不干；有的对新干部心怀不满，不积极加以帮助；有的怕社员耻笑，想搬出村去。在新当选的干部中也有一部分人对旧干部的成绩和缺点缺乏全面的认识。新旧干部之间的矛盾，影响着农业社的进一步巩固。
    针对上述情况，河北省各地领导机关对农业社的干部采取了团结教育的方针。中共沧县地方委员会研究总结重点县在这方面的经验，向其他各县推广。中共交河县委员会对全县各农业社的新、旧干部团结情况加以摸底排队，采取了适当的解决办法。这个县曾以乡为单位召开落选干部座谈会。会上，领导干部同落选干部谈心，征求意见，肯定成绩，批评缺点，帮助他们打消思想顾虑。高村乡三个落选的社主任原来生产消极，参加座谈会以后已经积极起来。对于一百九十八名因下放降职而情绪不高的社干部，由县工作组人员分别包干教育。因此，他们也大部积极起来了。同时，向社员进行说服教育以后，少数被坏人操纵选掉的社干部也有了适当的安置。这个县还以村为单位，由中共支部主持召开新、旧干部座谈会，让他们互相交流工作情况和经验，并且向他们进行团结教育。
