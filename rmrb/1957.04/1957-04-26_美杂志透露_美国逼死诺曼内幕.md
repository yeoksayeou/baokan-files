    U.S. Magazine Reveals the Inside Story of the U.S. Forcing Norman to His Death

    This newspaper reports that: Why did the U.S. force the Canadian Ambassador to Egypt, Norman, to his death? American newspapers have successively revealed some of the inside story. The "New Republic" magazine reported on April 22 that one of the reasons why the U.S. was "determined to eliminate" Norman was because Norman had been internally designated by the Canadian government as the future "first ambassador to Communist China." The U.S. is "now destroying Norman's reputation to preemptively undermine the possibility of Canada changing its policy towards China."

    According to the American "Stone Weekly" on April 15, Norman was likely forced to his death because he "criticized the U.S. policy during the Suez crisis." The publication said that in October of last year, Norman met with the U.S. Chargé d'Affaires in Lebanon, Empson, in Beirut and discussed the Suez crisis. Soon after, the U.S. Senate Internal Security Subcommittee summoned Empson to inquire in detail about Norman's attitude towards the U.S., Britain, and France during this conversation. Subsequently, this subcommittee immediately subpoenaed some witnesses who accused Norman of "disloyalty" and published their testimonies.

    美杂志透露
    美国逼死诺曼内幕
    本报讯  美国为什么要逼死加拿大驻埃及大使诺曼？美国报刊陆续透露了一些内幕。“新共和”杂志在4月22日报道说，美国“决心消灭”诺曼的原因之一，是因为诺曼曾被加拿大政府内定为将来的“驻共产党中国的首任大使”。美国“现在来破坏诺曼的名誉也就是预先破坏加拿大改变对中国的政策的可能性”。
    据美国“斯通周刊”在4月15日说，诺曼被逼死可能是因为他“批评了美国在苏伊士事件中的政策”。这个刊物说，去年10月，诺曼曾在贝鲁特会见美国驻黎巴嫩代办爱姆逊，谈及苏伊士事件。不久，美国参议院国内安全小组委员会就召见爱姆逊，详细查问在这次谈话中诺曼对美、英、法的态度。随后，这个小组委员会马上又传讯了一些指控诺曼“不忠诚”的证人，并且发表了证词。
