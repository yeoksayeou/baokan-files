Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 9th. The Secretary-General of the International Federation of Resistance Fighters and Victims of Fascism, Leroi, held a press conference in Berlin on the 8th to report on the proceedings and results of the Executive Committee meeting of the Federation held in Berlin from the 5th to the 7th.

Leroi pointed out that an important issue discussed at the meeting was the urgent need for universal disarmament. The meeting issued an appeal to the governments of all relevant countries and the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee, demanding the immediate conclusion of an agreement to halt nuclear weapons testing.

The increasingly dangerous resurgence of West German militarism was another important topic of the meeting. The meeting adopted a statement "on the Revival of German Militarism," calling on all resistance fighters and Nazi victims to unite in opposing the dangers arising from the revival of German militarism, in order to defend the common victory of the resistance movement.

Leroi said that the meeting also passed a resolution protesting against the West German government's discrimination against Nazi victims while favoring fascist executioners.

The meeting decided to convene the Federation's Third Congress in the spring of 1958.

Xinhua News Agency, April 9th. Frankfurt, West Germany News: West German Social Democratic Party Chairman Ollenhauer said at a party meeting in Frankfurt on April 7th that the West German army should not have atomic weapons, neither large nor small. He said that the Social Democrats opposed West Germany's participation in the nuclear arms race.

Ollenhauer demanded that West Germany take independent action, like Britain, "disregarding its allies and completely altering its military plans." He said that West Germany should act in accordance with the national interests of all Germans (East and West) when making decisions relating to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Xinhua News Agency, April 9th. Bonn News: West German Defense Minister Strauss said on the 8th that the United States had "in principle" agreed to give its North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies tactical atomic weapons.

Strauss also said at a press conference that he believed it was "impossible" for West Germany to lag behind its "North Atlantic Treaty Organization partners" in terms of atomic power.

    抵抗运动战士国际联合会执委会
    要求禁止核武器抗议西德军国主义复活
    奥伦豪尔反对西德军队配有原子武器
    新华社柏林9日电　抵抗运动战士及受法西斯迫害与囚禁者国际联合会总书记勒罗瓦8日在柏林举行记者招待会，报告了这个联合会的执行委员会从5日到7日在柏林举行会议的经过和结果。
    勒罗瓦指出，会议讨论的一个重要问题是普遍裁军的迫切必要性。会议向所有有关国家的政府和联合国裁军小组委员会发出了呼吁，要求立刻缔结停止核武器试验的协定。
    西德军国主义复活以后日益增长的危险是会议的另一个重要议题。会议通过了一项“关于德国军国主义的复活”的声明，号召所有抵抗运动战士和纳粹受害者在反对由于德国军国主义的复活而产生的危险中团结起来，以保卫抵抗运动的共同胜利。
    勒罗瓦说，会议还通过决议，抗议西德政府歧视纳粹受害者而同时却优抚法西斯刽子手。
    会议决定在1958年春季召开联合会第三次代表大会。
    新华社9日讯　西德法兰克福消息：西德社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔4月7日在法兰克福的一次党的会议上说，西德军队不应该有原子武器，不论是大的还是小的。他说，社会党人反对西德参加原子核军备竞赛。
    奥伦豪尔要求西德采取独立行动，像英国那样“不顾它的盟国而把它的军备计划完全加以更改”。他说，西德在作出关系到北大西洋公约组织的决定时，应该按照全德（东部和西部）人民的民族利益行事。
    新华社9日讯　波恩消息：西德国防部长施特劳斯8日说，美国“在原则上”同意给它的北大西洋公约盟国战术性原子武器。
    施特劳斯在记者招待会上还说：他认为，西德在原子力量方面是“不可能”落后于它的“北大西洋公约组织伙伴”的。
