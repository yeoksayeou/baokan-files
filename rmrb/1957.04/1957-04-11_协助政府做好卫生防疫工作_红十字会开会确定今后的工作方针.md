    Assist the Government in Public Health and Epidemic Prevention Work
    Red Cross Meeting Determines Future Work Guidelines
    (Our newspaper's report) The 1957 Red Cross work conference concluded in Beijing on the 10th.

    After summarizing the achievements made in 1956, the meeting also pointed out shortcomings such as a pursuit of numbers in membership development in a few areas, a lack of organized activities after development, and grassroots organizations becoming mere formalities. It was believed that future membership development should follow the method of "developing, organizing, training, and consolidating simultaneously," first absorbing medical personnel and sanitary activists among the masses as backbones, with those willing to learn health knowledge and able to undertake mass health work as the main targets. The content of grassroots organization and member activities should be combined with their life and work characteristics. Among street residents and employee families, the focus should be on doing a good job of cleaning, reporting epidemics, first aid, home care, and maternal and child health; in factories and mines, the focus should be on improving sanitary conditions, preventing occupational and common diseases, paying attention to safety facilities, and doing a good job of first aid; in factories with many female workers, maternal and child health propaganda should be strengthened; in rural areas, the focus should be on improving environmental sanitation by combining it with production and fertilizer accumulation, paying attention to drinking water disinfection, water source and manure management, promoting and publicizing new-style midwifery, preventing endemic and chronic infectious diseases, and using medicines delivered to the countryside; in schools, the focus should be on cultivating good sanitary habits among children, paying attention to preventing chronic infectious diseases, and assisting medical institutions in correcting shortcomings. Grassroots organizations in streets, factories, mines, and rural areas should also carry out family planning propaganda.

    The meeting believed that the most fundamental issue in consolidating grassroots organizations is to strengthen revolutionary humanitarian education of mutual assistance, love, and rescuing the wounded and sick, and to regularly conduct systematic health knowledge education for members to enhance their sense of honor and their knowledge and ability to serve the masses. At the same time, grassroots organizations and primary medical institutions should implement business links, absorb medical personnel to serve as leaders and help members learn health knowledge, and grassroots organizations should assist medical institutions in carrying out various health and epidemic prevention tasks. In addition, the meeting also studied the forms of grassroots organizations and other issues.

    Through the meeting, the participating representatives believed that, in order to adapt to China's current situation and the Red Cross's own conditions, the Red Cross work in 1957 should, under the principles of streamlining, economizing, and running affairs diligently and frugally, adopt a policy of steady advancement with key points and plans based on needs and possibilities, preventing biases such as being greedy for quick results or not developing when conditions are available, so as to more forcefully exert the Red Cross's positive role in implementing the policy of comprehensive prevention first and combining health work with mass movements, and its role as an assistant to health departments, and to continue to strengthen international work. The meeting pointed out that in carrying out work, it is also necessary to strengthen contact with government departments such as education, civil affairs, and public security, as well as mass organizations such as trade unions, the Communist Youth League, the Women's Federation, the Chinese Medical Association, the Nursing Association, and the Science Popularization Association.

    协助政府做好卫生防疫工作
    红十字会开会确定今后的工作方针
    本报讯　1957年红十字工作会议，已于10日在北京闭幕。
    会议在总结了1956年所取得的成绩以后，也指出了少数地区发展会员追求数字、发展后没有安排活动和基层组织流于形式等缺点。认为今后发展会员应该根据“边发展、边组织、边训练、边巩固”的方法，首先吸收医务人员和群众中的卫生积极分子骨干，以愿意学习卫生知识和能够担任群众卫生工作的人为主要对象。基层组织和会员活动内容应该同他们的生活和劳动特点结合起来。在街道居民和职工家属中应以搞好清洁扫除、疫情报告、急救、家庭护理和妇幼卫生为主；在厂矿中应以改善卫生状况、预防职业病和多发病、注意安全设施及搞好急救为主，女工多的工厂应加强妇幼卫生宣传；在农村中应结合生产积肥改进环境卫生、注意饮水消毒、水源和粪便管理、宣传和推动新法接生、预防地方病和慢性传染病以及使用下乡成药等为主；在学校中应以培养少年卫生习惯、注意预防慢性传染病和协助医疗机构矫治缺点为主。街道、厂矿、农村的基层组织，还应开展节育宣传。
    会议认为如何巩固基层组织的最基本的问题，是加强互助友爱、救死扶伤的革命人道主义教育，和经常搞好对会员的系统的卫生知识教育，以提高会员的光荣感和为群众服务的知识和能力；同时，基层组织和基层医疗机构要实行业务挂钩，吸收医务人员担任领导并帮助会员学习卫生知识，基层组织应该协助医疗机构做好各项卫生防疫工作。此外，会议对基层组织的形式等问题也作了研究。
    通过会议，与会代表们认为，适应我国目前情况及红十字会的本身条件，1957年红十字工作应该在精简节约和勤俭办会的原则下，根据需要和可能，采取有重点、有计划稳步前进的方针，防止贪多求快或有条件而不发展等偏向，以更有力地发挥红十字会在贯彻全面预防为主和卫生工作与群众运动相结合的方针的积极作用，和卫生部门的助手作用，并继续加强国际工作。会议指出，在开展工作时，还须加强同教育、民政、公安等政府部门及工会、青年团、妇联、中华医学会、护士学会、科普协会等群众组织的联系。
