Participating in Production Labor is the Fundamental Path for Middle and Primary School Graduates Who Cannot Continue Their Education

If I Can't Go to School, I'll Be a Barber
Zhangjiakou First Middle School Class 59, Yao Fude

After reading the People's Daily editorial on April 8th, I was very excited. Although there were some parts I didn't understand, it was like a key that unlocked the doubts in my mind and dispelled my worries.

I am a graduating junior high school student this year and have been anxious about my future after graduation for a long time. I used to think: What will I do after graduation? Get a job? That would be fine, because I have basic barbering skills and a set of barbering tools, and I sometimes cut hair for my classmates in my spare time; after a short period of study, it wouldn't be a problem to become a barber. However, I wasn't very willing, always thinking that being a barber was a low-status job, serving people, and there was no future; in any case, I didn't want to do this line of work.

So, what else could I do? If I were to go to a factory as a worker, I would be willing if the working conditions were better and I could earn more money; however, that possibility is unlikely. I think the most likely and desirable thing is to continue my education. However, going to high school and then university is a bit expensive, and my family's financial situation does not allow it; after thinking it over, I think it would be good to test into a secondary specialized school, which would not only reduce the family's financial burden, but the government would also assign a job after graduation, and maybe I could even go to university in the future. This is really killing two birds with one stone.

When I talked about my aspirations in composition class, I described this idea in detail, but I didn't mention a word about what should be done if I couldn't continue my education. I thought the government would take care of everything.

When I heard that secondary specialized schools might not be enrolling new students this year, I felt a little depressed and had some resentment towards the government.

After reading the editorial, I realized that when considering my personal aspirations, I had forgotten a basic principle—personal aspirations must be subordinate to the needs of the country.

In the past, I placed great importance on personal fame, gain, status, and position. Now, I understand that this is wrong. I now declare: If I cannot continue my education, I will pick up my tools and become a cultured barber, serving the millions of people. At that time, I will definitely learn from the older barbers, improve my skills, and strive to beautify the lives of the masses.

### 升不了学就当理发员
要复德

    参加生产劳动是不能升学的中小学毕业生的根本道路
    升不了学就当理发员
    张家口第一中学五十九班　要复德
    看了人民日报4月8日的社论以后，我很激动。尽管有些地方我不懂，但它仍像一把钥匙一样，打开了我的思想中疑难的锁，解除了我的疑虑。
    我是今年初中应届毕业生，很早以前就为毕业后的出路问题着急。以前我这样想：毕业后作什么呢？就业吗？也成，因为我会理发的基本技术，也有一套理发工具，并且在课余有时也给同学们理发；如果经过短期的学习，当一名理发员是不成问题的。可是，我不大愿意，总认为当理发员，低三下四地侍候人，一点出息也没有；无论如何，我不想干这一行。
    那么干其它的呢？如果要进工厂当一名工人，要是工作条件好一些、能多挣钱倒愿意；不过这种可能性不大。我认为可能性最大也最合心愿的是升学。但是，升高中再升大学，有些费钱，我家庭的经济情况不允许；思来想去，觉得考中等专业学校倒不错，既可减轻家庭经济负担，毕业后政府还给分配工作，将来或者还能进大学。这真是一举两得的事情。
    我在作文课谈我的志愿的时候，把这种想法细腻地描写了一番，至于升不了学应当怎样办，我只字未提。我认为政府会把一切都包下来的。
    当我听说今年中等专业学校可能不招新生的时候，心中就有些气闷，并对政府有些埋怨情绪。
    看了社论以后，我才明白，我在考虑个人志愿的时候，忘掉了一条基本原则——个人的志愿要服从国家的需要。
    过去，我把个人的名利得失、地位的高低，看得很重。现在，我明白了这是不对的。我现在表示：如果升不了学，我就拿起我的工具，去当一名有文化的理发员，去为千万群众服务。那时我一定好好向理发前辈学习，提高技术，为美化群众的生活而努力。
