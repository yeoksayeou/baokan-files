Do Not Relax the Transformation of Joint Public-Private Enterprises
    Liu Shizeng
    Since the implementation of full industry-wide public-private partnership in Beijing's private commercial sector, the ideological awareness of the majority of private personnel has improved, especially among large and medium shareholders (mainly large shareholders). The private personnel's thinking is relatively stable, their management is active, and the enterprise system is relatively sound, with generally few problems. However, the situation is more complex among medium and small shareholders, especially small shareholders and those with independent accounting. According to our investigation in the Xidan District, we found the following problems.

    Some shareholders, seeing that many commodities were in short supply last year and those with independent accounting were making a lot of money, felt regret, believing that "the joint venture was a loss." Zhao Minghai, the manager of "Zhengxintang" Traditional Chinese Medicine Shop, said: "Large shareholders are doing well, they have reputation and status; even the family-owned shops are doing well, with independent accounting, making a lot of money, and with freedom; only we, who were active in the past, are now suffering." In fact, both he and his wife were assigned jobs after the enterprise became a joint venture, with a monthly income of 320 yuan, which was enough to support a family of seven. Some households had chaotic accounts and expanded their expenses after the public-private partnership. "Wanjuyong" mountain goods store had a shortage of more than 1,500 kinds of 7,360-plus pieces of goods in the first half of 1956, worth about 2,600 yuan, accounting for 12.5% of all goods sold. The monthly average expenditure of "Jidetang" Traditional Chinese Medicine Shop was 135 yuan in 1955 (including the salaries of three people). After the joint venture in 1956, the monthly average expenditure increased to 199 yuan in the second quarter, and then to 380 yuan in the third quarter. The original three-person salary was stipulated to be 150 yuan, but after July of last year, it rose to 200 yuan. In the "Tongyixing" department store, even the private personnel's expenses for dental work were paid by the store. In addition, corruption, illegal activities, and passive slowdowns were not uncommon. For example, among the 320 employees in the public-private joint venture stores under the Xicheng Management Office of the Trading Company, 7.1% embezzled or lost public funds and engaged in corruption, amounting to more than 3,600 yuan. In the oil and salt industry, tea, wine, rock sugar, dried shrimp, and other items often disappeared inexplicably. In the "Tongyixing" department store, two family members of the capitalists who were assigned jobs were not willing to work and used illness as an excuse. They have not been to work since January 10th.

    Among the independently accounting households, a considerable portion are hanging the signboard of public-private partnership and using the state's care to engage in illegal activities. Some are raising prices to seek exorbitant profits. For example, before the partnership, the fruit industry association agreed that the profit margin for fruits was 20%, but now it has grown to 75%-85%; individual stores are as high as 140%-150%. The "Tianxingyong" store's oranges cost 0.25 yuan per catty, and are sold for 0.60 yuan; coconuts cost 0.45 yuan, and are sold for 1.10 yuan; Vietnamese pomelos cost 0.35 yuan, and are sold for 0.75 yuan. Some are cutting corners and shortchanging customers. In the catering industry, the portions of breakfast are generally insufficient: an oil pancake costing 0.10 yuan should weigh six taels according to regulations, but in reality it is five taels, and the least is only four taels; five sesame cakes should weigh nine and a half taels according to regulations, but in reality they weigh seven and a half taels. The masses are very dissatisfied with these situations. The catering industry boasts to each other with smugness: "Every day from 7:00 AM to 8:00 AM is our golden age." Some oil and salt businesses dilute leek flowers, shrimp paste, and green pepper paste with water up to 100% or more. Some households, seeing that certain commodities are in short supply, hoard state-supplied commodities and refuse to sell them. According to inspections, seven out of twenty-four oil and salt shops hoarded chickens, noodles, scallions, garlic, Longkou vermicelli, etc., refusing to sell them; the pork, beef, and mutton industries only put out a small amount of meat to deal with retail sales every day, and most of it was sold "through the back door" to regular customers.

    These households do not use the money earned from high profits to expand their business, but rather squander it arbitrarily. The "Shuguang" blueprint company and other households, under the guise of cooperative groups, contracted for a large number of blueprints, using inflated labor hours and prices to obtain illegal profits, and then bought brand-name watches such as "Omega" and "Madden," and top-quality British-made "Kern Mill" woolen overcoat fabric, as well as furnishings. They also mocked shareholders: "No matter how superior you are, you are not as superior as us." "Independent accounting is not bad, business is good, making a lot of money, and it's free. The monthly business income is enough to eat and drink, and there's still a surplus."

    Now, some households have openly resisted transformation. For example, the "Hongyuanxiang" department store, which had not been set up with fixed shares in the past to take care of the capitalist's life, has seen improved business after the full industry-wide partnership. Now, the state-owned company has proposed that he set up fixed shares, and the capitalist Wu Guoliang replied: "Setting up fixed shares is okay, but give me a salary of 120 yuan per month, no less; if it's based on labor, I won't accept it. The enterprise's house cannot be set up with fixed shares, rent is needed." There was an original plan for two households in the sugar and pastry industry to be set up with fixed shares, but because the capitalists firmly disagreed, it did not happen. Among the independently accounting households, there is a prevailing argument: public-private partnership is not as good as cooperative stores, cooperative stores are not as good as cooperative groups, and cooperative groups are not as good as going it alone.

    Why have these intolerable things happened after the city's private commercial sector has implemented full industry-wide public-private partnership? I believe that the main reason is that relevant cadres have insufficient understanding of the long-term and complex nature of the work of transforming capitalism. Once the transformation climax passed, they believed that everything was fine, and a situation of government, Federation of Industry and Commerce, and state-owned commerce each minding their own business appeared, and the ideological education of private personnel was relaxed. Within the joint venture enterprises, private personnel felt that the enterprise had become a joint venture, and they were not working as hard; the employees felt that it was a joint venture, and there was no need to supervise the enterprise. However, judging from the above materials, there are still many problems after the full industry-wide partnership. It is urgent to attract our attention.

    In order to solve these problems, I believe that the government, state-owned commerce, and the Federation of Industry and Commerce should strengthen the management of shareholders and those with independent accounting, divide the scope of responsibilities of all parties, and clarify the division of labor. State-owned commercial departments are responsible for management, business arrangements, business style, and ideological education of private personnel. The government is responsible for checking the implementation of policies and ideological education. The Federation of Industry and Commerce is mainly responsible for patriotic and law-abiding education of private personnel. All parties should formulate a set of management systems. Trade unions and the Communist Youth League should strengthen education for employees and young people, and overcome the idea of slacking off. Industrialists and businessmen should also supervise each other, overcome capitalist business ideas, strive to make contributions to the socialist cause, and become self-reliant workers.

    不要放松对合营商业的改造
    刘式增
    自从北京市的私营商业实行全行业公私合营后，绝大部分私方人员的思想觉悟都有提高，特别是定股的大户和中户（主要是大户），私方人员思想比较稳定，经营积极，企业制度也比较健全，一般的问题较少。但在中、小户中，尤其是小户及自负盈亏户中，则情况较复杂。据我们在西单区的调查，发现如下一些问题。
    有些定股户，看到去年不少商品供不应求，自负盈亏户赚钱很多，产生后悔情绪，认为“合营上当了。”“正心堂”中药铺经理赵明海说：“大户好了，有名誉，有地位；连家铺也好了，自负盈亏，赚钱多，又自由；就是我们，过去积极，现在吃亏了。”其实他们夫妇二人在企业合营后都安排了工作，每月工资收入三百二十元，供养七口人，完全够用了。有些户在公私合营后账目混乱，扩大开支：“万聚永”山货店1956年上半年共短少了一千五百多种七千三百六十多件商品，约值二千六百元，占全部售出商品的12.5％。“继德堂”中药铺1955年每月平均开支一百三十五元（包括三人的工资），1956年合营后，第二季度每月开支平均增加到一百九十九元，第三季度又增到三百八十元了。合营后原规定三人工资共一百五十元，但去年7月份以后，就长到二百元。“同益兴”百货店私方人员连镶牙的钱也由商店开支。此外贪污违法，消极怠工的现象也不是少数。如贸易公司西城管理处所属各公私合营门市部从业人员三百二十人中，有挪用、丢失公款及贪污行为的即占7.1％，款数达三千六百多元。在油盐业中，常有茶叶、酒、冰糖、大虾米等不翼而飞的事。百货业“同益兴”商店里，有两个被安排的资方家属不安心工作，借口有病，自1月10日至目前尚未上班。
    在自负盈亏户中，有相当一部分挂着公私合营的招牌，利用国家的照顾，进行违法勾当。有的高抬价格，谋取暴利。如合营前水果同业公会议定水果利润率为20％，现在都长到75％—85％；个别商店高达140％—150％。“天兴永”商店的桔子每斤进价二角五分，售价六角；椰子进价四角五分，售价一元一角；越南柚子进价三角五分，售价七角五分。有的偷工减料，亏斤短两。饮食业方面，早点的分量普遍不足：一角钱一个的油饼，按规定应重六两，实际是五两，最少的只有四两多；烧饼五个，规定应重九两五钱，实际重七两五钱。群众对这些情况很不满意。饮食业间却彼此得意地炫耀：“每天早七点到八点是我们的黄金时代。”有的油盐业户在韭菜花、虾酱、青椒糊中掺水高达百分之百以上。有的户看到某些商品供不应求时，就把国家供给的商品囤积拒售。据检查，二十四户油盐店中有七户囤积鸡子、挂面、大葱、大蒜、龙口粉等不肯出卖；猪、牛、羊肉业每天只摆出少量的肉应酬门市，大部分“开后门”卖给熟顾客了。
    这些户把高利赚来的钱并不用作扩充营业，而是任意挥霍。“曙光”晒图社等户假借合作小组名义，承揽大批图纸，用高估工时和价格的方法，取得非法利润后，买“欧米嘎”“麦登那”等名牌手表，买英国产“克恩宓”牌上等大衣呢，以及置办家具。他们还嘲笑定股户：“你们怎样优越也不如我们优越。”“自负盈亏倒不错，买卖好，赚钱多，又自由，每月的营业收入够吃够喝，还有敷余。”
    现在，有的户已公开抗拒改造。如“宏源祥”百货店，过去为照顾资方生活未定股，全行业合营后营业好转，现在国营公司提出要他定股，资方吴国良回答：“定股可以，每月给我一百二十元工资，不能低；如按劳付酬，我不接受。企业的房子不能定股，需要房租。”糖业糕点业原计划有两户可以定股，因资方坚决不同意，未成。自负盈亏户中流传着这样一种论调：公私合营不如合作商店，合作商店不如合作小组，合作小组还不如单干。
    为什么在全市私营商业已经实行公私合营后，又产生了这些令人不能容忍的事情呢？我认为，主要是有关干部对改造资本主义工作的长期性、复杂性认识不足，改造高潮一过，就认为万事大吉，出现了政府、工商联、国营商业三不管，对私方人员的思想教育放松了。在合营企业内部，私方人员认为企业合营了，干的劲头不大了；职工们认为合营了，对企业不必监督了。但是，从上面的材料看来，全行业合营后，问题还是很多的。亟须引起我们的注意。
    为了解决这些问题，我认为政府、国营商业、工商联三方面应加强对定股户和自负盈亏户的管理，划分各方面的职责范围，明确分工。有关经营管理、业务安排、经营作风和私方人员的思想教育等工作，归国营商业部门负责；政府负责检查政策执行情形和思想教育工作；工商联主要负责对私方人员的爱国守法教育。各方面都要制定一套管理制度。工会和青年团要加强对职工和青年的教育，克服松劲思想。工商业者们也应互相监督，克服资本主义经营思想，争取为社会主义事业立功，作一个自食其力的劳动者。
