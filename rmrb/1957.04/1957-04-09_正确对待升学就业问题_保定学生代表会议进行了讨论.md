Xinhua News Agency report: Hebei Province's educational departments and Communist Youth League organizations are closely concerned with the issues of further education and employment for graduating students from secondary schools across the province. From March 31st to April 4th, a student representative conference for secondary schools in Baoding City and Baoding Special District was held in Baoding City, with over 500 student representatives from 57 schools participating.

	Ma Guorui, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, addressed the meeting. He requested that the representatives and all graduating students in the province make two-fold preparations in their minds. On the one hand, they should prepare for further education, and on the other hand, if they fail to be admitted to schools, they should bravely and happily take up employment, go into agricultural production, and go into handicraft production. Zhang Chengxian, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, analyzed the current domestic situation at the meeting and said that the development of our education system must take into account both the needs of the people and the possibilities of the conditions. Schools cannot be established too quickly. It is good for everyone to have their own aspirations, but individual aspirations should adapt to objective conditions and meet the needs of the country. Ruan Bosheng, Deputy Governor of Hebei Province, told the representatives at the meeting that the countryside still lacks tens of thousands of accountants, technicians, work recorders, educated production team leaders, production group leaders, and other talents. Only after students cultivated in our primary, junior high, and senior high schools are dispatched back to the countryside in large numbers in the next few years can this cultural backwardness be changed, and the countryside be built faster and better. Li Xing, Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, called on young students at the meeting to love the countryside, not to be afraid of difficulties, to put down their student airs and participate in labor, to integrate with the masses, to combine knowledge with labor, to become new-type laborers with culture, and to constantly learn and improve themselves in labor.

	The student representatives conducted serious discussions on how to correctly approach the issues of further education and employment. Finally, in a letter to all graduating students of secondary schools in the province, they stated that they fully accepted the demands of the Party and the government on them, and that in the future, they would adhere to the "five no matters" in their approach to job assignments: no matter reputation or status, no matter the quality of the region, no matter the distance, no matter the level of compensation, no matter the simplicity or complexity of the work. They were determined to treat the issues of further education and employment with the spirit of enduring hardship first and enjoying comfort later.

	Most other special districts, cities, and counties in Hebei Province will also convene student representative conferences for secondary schools in late April or early May, based on the spirit of this conference.

    正确对待升学就业问题
    保定学生代表会议进行了讨论
    据新华社讯　河北省教育部门和青年团组织密切关怀全省中等学校应届毕业生的升学就业问题。3月31日到4月4日在保定市召开了保定市、保定专区中等学校学生代表会议，参加会议的有五十七个学校的五百多名学生代表。
    中共河北省委书记处书记马国瑞在会上讲了话，他要求代表们和全省应届毕业学生，在精神上应当做两方面准备，一方面做升学准备，另方面考不上学校就勇敢地、愉快地就业，到农业生产中去，到手工业生产中去。中共河北省委书记处书记张承先在会上对目前国内形势作了分析后说，我国教育事业的发展既要考虑到人民的需要，又要考虑到条件的可能，学校不能一下子办得太多，每个人有自己的志愿是好的，但是个人志愿应当适应客观条件，适应国家的需要。河北省副省长阮泊生在会上告诉代表们，目前农村还缺少成千上万的会计员、技术员、记工员、有文化的生产队长、生产小组长等人材，只有今后若干年内在我们高小、初中、高中学校培养出来的学生大批派回乡村之后，才能改变这种文化落后状况，也才能把农村建设得更快更好。青年团河北省委书记李兴在会上号召青年学生们要热爱农村，不怕困难，放下学生的架子参加劳动，和群众打成一片，把知识和劳动结合起来，做一个有文化的新型劳动者，在劳动中不断地学习和提高自己。
    学生代表们对如何正确对待升学就业的问题做了认真讨论，最后他们在致全省中等学校应届毕业生的一封信中表示，完全接受党和政府对自己的要求，今后对待分配工作要做到“五不论”，就是：不论名誉地位、不论地区好坏、不论远近、不论待遇高低、不论工作繁简。决心以吃苦在先、享乐在后的精神对待升学和就业的问题。
    河北省其他大部分专区、市、县也将根据这次会议的精神，分别在4月末或5月初召开中等学校学生代表会议。
