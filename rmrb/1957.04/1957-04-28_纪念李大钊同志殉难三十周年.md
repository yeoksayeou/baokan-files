I am recuperating from illness in the countryside, and my residence is not far from the Wanan Cemetery. I have paid my respects at the grave of Comrade Li Dazhao (Shouchang). I also discovered that Comrade Deng Wenhui's grave is only a few dozen steps away from Comrade Shouchang's. Thirty years ago today, those who died alongside Comrade Shouchang included communist party members like Yang Jingshan and Tan Zuyiao, as well as Kuomintang members like Lu Youyu (from Shandong) and Deng Wenhui (from Hunan). From the winter of 1923 to the spring of 1926, I worked under the leadership of Comrade Shouchang in Beijing, which was the scene of the first Kuomintang-Communist cooperation. This leaves a deep impression on me to this day. After paying respects at the tomb, this impression is further deepened. I believe that for the consolidation and victory of the patriotic cause, patriotic people from all walks of life, given certain conditions, can join our party in entering the broad road of socialism. The comrades who sacrificed together with Comrade Shouchang proved this belief in history with their revolutionary activities.

Recently, Chairman Mao issued a call to prepare for a third Kuomintang-Communist cooperation. I fully support this call. If we communists can be modest and open-minded, have broad minds and get rid of sectarianism, we can more actively promote the broader and greater coming of this situation. I think Comrade Li Shouchang is a typical example of being good at cooperating with others. Comrades inside and outside the party are happy to be close to him, and he is worthy of our commemoration and learning.

Because I know a little about the situation at the time, I am sorry that I am unable to write a longer commemorative text because I have not fully recovered from illness, but the People's Daily asked me to write an article to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Comrade Li Shouchang's martyrdom. However, I have benefited a lot from Comrade Shouchang's teachings in the past, and I have often read his posthumous works, so I still try my best to write some opinions. Comrade Shouchang wrote articles in publications such as "Yanzhi Monthly", "Jia Yin Magazine", "New Youth" and "Beijing Political Life" from 1913 to 1926, a total of thirteen years. These included political essays, literary translations, essays, poems, and historical works, with Marxist-Leninist discussions being the most common after the October Revolution in Russia. In my personal opinion, Comrade Shouchang's life can be summarized by the sixteen characters "studying tirelessly, teaching tirelessly, a revolutionary pioneer, and unyielding in the face of great adversity." The correct and sophisticated parts of his Marxist-Leninist exposition have been proven by 30 years of revolutionary practice. At the same time, like all advanced figures of our time, limited by historical conditions, it was impossible to completely solve all problems at that time, and the ideological remnants of the old era could not be completely eliminated. This is in line with scientific logic. How can we correctly understand this? I personally think of my own age of nearly sixty years old, and in the modern era of 1957, how insufficient my personal knowledge is, and how I cannot fully understand and correctly grasp the new situation of socialist construction, then I know the greatness of the pioneers and their difficulty in recognizing problems and pursuing the truth. "Future generations looking at the present is like the present looking at the past," this sentence should be savored more.

Chairman Mao often advocates hard study, overcomes arrogance and rashness, and recently proposed correctly handling contradictions among the people and preparing for rectification again. This is completely right. I believe that this is what we communists should respond to first, and I am even happier to see that party organizations at all levels are taking action!

I have abbreviated the above feelings into a few poems to commemorate Comrade Li Shouchang and the comrades who were executed with him!
              (I)
    Revolutionary thoughts early, Observing discipline in action,
    Executed calmly, Great integrity unyielding.
              (II)
    Comrade Ji wields the brush, For thirteen years before and after,
    Pioneer with a good heart, Pine and cypress endure the cold of the year.
              (III)
    Studying tirelessly on his own, How diligent he is in teaching others,
    Without sectarian spirit, Inside and outside follow like clouds.
              (IV)
    Executed together in Beijing, Fresh blood becomes redder over time,
    People's martyrdom in the marketplace, Noble spirit runs through the long rainbow. [Note 1]
              (V)
    Relying on a corner ultimately misleads oneself, What is the reason for waiting,
    In fact, truly patriotic, Cooperation can be achieved a third time. [Note 2]
              (VI)
    Counting the days of sacrifice, Thirty years to this day,
    The people are greatly unified, Comfort and moving forward.
    Note 1: Wen Tianxiang, the Prime Minister of the Southern Song Dynasty, was executed and died for his integrity at the Caishikou in Yanjing. Chinese drama performances of this historical fact are called "Caishi Dies for Integrity." The location is now Luomashi Street outside Xuanwumen in Beijing. Comrade Shouchang and others were executed in the detention center of the Beijing Procuratorate inside Zhengyangmen, located in today's Hou Street, Ministry of Justice, Xijiaomin Lane. Not far away, so it is called the People's Caishi Festival.
    Note 2: Refers to the possible situation after the peaceful liberation of Taiwan. (Attached picture)

    纪念李大钊同志殉难三十周年
    陈毅
    村居养病，住处距万安公墓不远。我曾到李大钊守常同志的墓前凭吊过。并且发现邓文辉同志的墓与守常同志的墓相近不过数十步。按三十年前的今日与守常同志共同殉难的如杨景山、谭祖尧等是共产党员，如路友于（山东人）、邓文辉（湖南人）等是国民党员。我于1923年冬至1926年春在党与守常同志领导之下在北京与他们一道工作，这是第一次国共合作的情景，至今印象很深，瞻拜墓道后，更加深这一印象。我相信为了爱国事业的巩固与胜利，各方面的爱国人士在具备一定的条件下，均可与我党共同进入社会主义的康庄大道的。与守常同志一道牺牲的同志们以他们的革命活动在历史上证实了这一信念。
    最近毛主席有准备第三次国共合作的号召，我完全支持这一号召。如果我们共产党员能虚怀若谷，有宽广胸襟和丢掉宗派主义色彩，便更能主动地推动这一局势的更广阔、更壮大的来临。我认为李守常同志恰是一个善于与人合作的典型，党内党外同志，都乐于亲近他，值得我们纪念和学习。
    由于我多少知道一点当时情况，为了纪念李守常同志殉难三十周年，人民日报向我征文，我很抱歉，因为病未完全脱体，不能写较长的纪念文字。但我过去在工作中受过守常同志不少教益，平常也曾翻读他的遗文，所以我仍勉力来写一点意见。守常同志从1913年起先后在言治月刊、甲寅杂志、新青年和北京政治生活等报刊上写文章，至1926年为止，前后共十三年，其中有政论，有文艺译作，有杂文，有诗作，有史学著作，而俄国十月革命后以马列主义论述为最多。守常同志的生平，据个人私见，可以用“学而不厌，诲人不倦，革命先驱，大节不辱”十六字概括之。他的马列主义论述其正确与精湛的部分已为三十年来的革命实践所证明。同时他也与我们同时代的所有先进人物一样，限于历史条件，当时不可能完全正确解决一切问题，旧时代的思想残余不可能一下剔除净尽，这正是合乎科学逻辑的。我们如何来正确认识这一点呢？我个人是首先想到我自己年近六旬，又当着1957年的现代，我个人的知识是如何的不足，是如何不能完全认识和正确掌握社会主义建设的新形势，便知道先驱者的伟大处和他们认识问题追求真理的艰苦。“后之视今，亦犹今之视昔”，这句话应多加玩味。
    毛主席经常提倡努力学习，戒骄戒躁，而最近又提出正确处理人民内部矛盾和准备再整风，这是完全对的，我相信这是我们共产党员们应首先响应的，而且我看到各级党的组织正在采取行动，我个人更为高兴！
    我把上述一点感言缩写成几句诗，以纪念李守常同志及同他一道就义的同志们！
              （一）
    革命思想早，　行动守纪律，
    就义从容甚，　大节凛不辱。
              （二）
    计公操翰墨，　前后十三年，
    先驱好肝胆，　松柏耐岁寒。
              （三）
    自学浑不倦，　诲人何其勤，
    没有宗派气，　内外从如云。
              （四）
    北京同就义，　鲜血久愈红，
    人民柴市节，　浩气贯长虹。〔注一〕
              （五）
    负嵎终自误，　等待缘何情，
    其实真爱国，　合作可三能。〔注二〕
              （六）
    屈指捐躯日，　迄今三十年，
    人民大统一，　告慰更向前。
    注一：南宋丞相文天祥就义尽节于燕京柴市口，中国戏剧表演此史实，名为柴市尽节，地点在今北京宣武门外骡马市大街。守常同志等就义于北京正阳门内京师检察厅看守所，地点在今西交民巷司法部后街。相距不远，故谓之为人民柴市节。
    注二：指和平解放台湾后的可能局势。（附图片）
