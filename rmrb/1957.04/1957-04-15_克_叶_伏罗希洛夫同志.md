Comrade Kliment Yefremovich Voroshilov is an active figure in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet state, one of the oldest Bolsheviks, and an organizer and outstanding commander of the Soviet armed forces. Comrade Voroshilov is currently a member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

Comrade Voroshilov was born on February 4, 1881, in the village of Verkhne in the former Yekaterinoslav Province (now Voroshilovgrad Oblast of the Ukrainian Republic), into a railway worker's family. When he was only six or seven years old, he began working in the mines. Later, he herded livestock for landlords and worked as a hired hand for wealthy peasants. He only attended the village school for two winters.

In 1896, Comrade Voroshilov began working at the Alchevsk (now Voroshilovsk) steel plant. In 1898, at the age of seventeen, Voroshilov began his revolutionary activities here, organizing workers to fight against exploitation and oppression. In 1903, Comrade Voroshilov went to work at the Lugansk (now Voroshilovgrad) locomotive factory, and in the same year, he joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. From then on, he consistently adhered to the Bolshevik position, dedicating his entire life to the cause of the working class.

During the first Russian Revolution of 1905-1907, Comrade Voroshilov stood at the forefront of the revolutionary workers of the Donbass, actively leading the revolutionary struggle of workers and nearby peasants. The Lugansk locomotive factory where Comrade Voroshilov worked at the time became the center of the Donbass workers' movement.

In 1906, Comrade Voroshilov was elected as a delegate to the Fourth Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (United), where he first met Lenin and Stalin. After the congress, Comrade Voroshilov was twice sent to Finland to transport weapons from there to Lugansk in preparation for the revolution. In the following years, Comrade Voroshilov continued to carry out revolutionary activities not only in Ukraine but also in Baku, Petrograd, and other places. During his revolutionary activities, he was repeatedly arrested and exiled by the Tsarist government. However, after managing to escape, he continued to engage in revolutionary activities unremittingly.

In 1917, the year of the great Russian Revolution, Comrade Voroshilov carried out intensive and enormous revolutionary leadership work. During the February Revolution, which overthrew the Tsarist autocracy, Comrade Voroshilov served as a representative of the Petrograd Workers' Soviet and a member of the Executive Committee of the Bolshevik faction in the City Soviet. After the outbreak of the Great October Socialist Revolution, Comrade Voroshilov served as the People's Commissar (Mayor) of Petrograd and, together with Dzerzhinsky, carried out the work of establishing the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission for Combating Counter-Revolution.

During the years of foreign armed intervention and civil war, Comrade Voroshilov made great contributions to defending the young Soviet Republic and establishing the Soviet armed forces. Comrade Voroshilov organized the "First Lugansk Socialist Guerrilla Detachment" in Ukraine and personally led it in fighting against the German interventionists. Shortly thereafter, Comrade Voroshilov led the Ukrainian Fifth Army Corps, broke through the encirclement of the German interventionist forces and the Don Cossack counter-revolutionary forces, and heroically completed the famous march to Tsaritsyn (now Stalingrad) after fierce battles. The battle to defend Tsaritsyn was a battle that determined the fate of the Soviet state. In this famous defense, Comrade Voroshilov was Stalin's closest assistant. He was then the commander of the Tenth Army and commander of the Tsaritsyn Front, deputy commander of the Southern Front, and a member of the Revolutionary Military Council. In 1918, after the German aggressors were driven out of Ukraine, Comrade Voroshilov was elected as a member of the Ukrainian Workers' and Peasants' Government, concurrently serving as the People's Commissar of Internal Affairs of the Ukrainian Republic. Later, he successively commanded the Yekaterinoslav Defense and the Kiev Defense.

In November 1919, the First Cavalry Army was established according to the resolution of the Revolutionary Military Council of the Southern Front. Comrades Voroshilov, Budyonny, and Shchadenko served as members of the Revolutionary Military Council of this army. The First Cavalry Army actively participated in the battle to crush the White Guard Denikin, driving them all the way from the center of the country to the Caucasus. In 1920, this cavalry also participated in the arduous thousand-kilometer march to the Polish front, and together with other fraternal troops, liberated Ukraine, which was occupied by Polish White Guard elements, and later participated in the battle to eliminate the Wrangel White Guard.

In 1921, Comrade Voroshilov personally led a portion of the delegates to the 10th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in crushing the Kronstadt counter-revolutionary rebellion. From 1921 to 1924, Comrade Voroshilov served as the commander of the North Caucasus Military District, and from 1924 to 1925, he served as the commander of the Moscow Military District.

After Frunze's death in 1925, Comrade Voroshilov took on the leadership of the Soviet armed forces, serving as the People's Commissar for the Army and Navy of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council. From June 1934, he served as the People's Commissar of Defense of the Soviet Union. In 1935, Comrade Voroshilov was awarded the title of Marshal of the Soviet Union. He was the first person to be awarded the title of Marshal in the Soviet Union. In the position of leader of the Soviet armed forces, Comrade Voroshilov did a great deal of work in consolidating the troops, improving their combat effectiveness, training Soviet military cadres, and educating Soviet soldiers, and achieved outstanding merits. In 1940, Comrade Voroshilov was appointed Deputy Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Defense Committee.

During the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union, Comrade Voroshilov actively participated in leading the army to defeat the fascist aggressors, serving as a member of the Defense Committee. Comrade Voroshilov participated in the Moscow Conference of the Soviet, American, and British representatives in 1941 and the Tehran Conference of the heads of state of the Soviet Union, Great Britain, and the United States in 1943.

From the 10th Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1921, Comrade Voroshilov was elected as a member of the Party Central Committee, and from 1926, he was a member of the Central Political Bureau. After the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1952, Comrade Voroshilov was elected as a member of the Presidium of the Party Central Committee. He was also repeatedly elected as a member of the Soviet Central Executive Committee and a representative of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. From March 1946 to March 1953, Comrade Voroshilov served as Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union. In March 1953, he was elected Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. Now, Comrade Voroshilov is working tirelessly in this glorious position, together with other leaders of the Party and government, to lead the Soviet people in building communism, consolidating world peace, and strengthening international cooperation.

Comrade Voroshilov's life is inseparable from the struggle of the Soviet people for a better life. For his great contributions to the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet people, he has been repeatedly awarded various orders and medals. Last February, on the occasion of Comrade Voroshilov's seventy-fifth birthday, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union awarded him the title of "Hero of the Soviet Union" and once again awarded him the Order of Lenin and the "Gold Star" medal. Comrade Voroshilov has received a total of six Orders of Lenin, six Orders of the Red Banner, one Order of Suvorov First Class, and many medals.
