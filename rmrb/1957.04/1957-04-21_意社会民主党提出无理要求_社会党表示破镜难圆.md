Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 20th dispatch: Many members of the Italian Socialist Party and the Italian Social Democratic Party believed on the 19th that relations between the two parties had broken down.

The majority faction of the Social Democratic Party's leadership, headed by Italian Deputy Prime Minister Saragat, issued a three-point ultimatum to the Socialists, led by Nenni, on the evening of the 18th.

The Socialist Party's leadership immediately rejected this ultimatum, stating that this action meant the end of efforts to merge the two parties.

The three conditions of the Social Democratic Party were: the Socialist Party should immediately withdraw from mass organizations such as the National Peace Council; the Socialist Party's participation in the Italian General Confederation of Labor, as a member of the World Federation of Trade Unions, should be regarded as an "error of the times"; the Socialist Party should withdraw from the municipal and provincial governments formed together with the Communists.

In rejecting these conditions, the Socialists declared that only after the Social Democrats withdrew from the crumbling coalition government led by the Christian Democrats and Segni would it be useful to resume negotiations on the merger issue.

British Labour Party leader Gaitskell is scheduled to arrive in Rome on the 20th to try to bring them back together. However, observers believe that it will be difficult for Gaitskell to facilitate the merger of the two parties.

    意社会民主党提出无理要求
    社会党表示破镜难圆
    据新华社20日讯　罗马消息：意大利社会党和意大利社会民主党的不少党员19日认为，两党之间的关系已经破裂。
    以意大利副总理萨拉盖特为首的社会民主党指导处的多数派18日晚对以南尼为首的社会党人发出了三点最后通牒。
    社会党的指导处立即拒绝了这项最后通牒，并且指出，这种做法意味着两党合并的努力已经告终。
    社会党民主党人的三项条件是：社会党人立即退出像全国和平理事会等群众性团体；社会党人参加作为世界工联的一员的意大利总工会，应该看作是一种“时代的错误”；社会党人应该退出同共产党人一起组成的市和省的政府。
    社会党人在拒绝这些条件时宣称，只有在社会民主党人退出天主教民主党和塞尼所领导的摇摇欲坠的联合政府以后，恢复合并问题的谈判才会有用。
    英国工党领袖盖次克尔定在20日到达罗马。设法促使他们再度团结起来。但是，观察家认为，盖次克尔将很难促成两党的合并。
