    Djuanda Kartawidjaja

    The newly appointed Indonesian Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, Djuanda Kartawidjaja, is a non-partisan figure. He is the first non-partisan individual to serve as Prime Minister in Indonesia's seventeen cabinets.

    Djuanda was born in Tasikmalaya, West Java, in July 1911. In 1933, he graduated from Bandung Institute of Technology with a degree in engineering. Before entering politics, he served as the principal of a Muhammadiyah Islamic school and as an engineer in the West Java Water Resources Bureau. During Indonesia's independence struggle, he held positions such as Deputy Minister of Transportation, Minister of Transportation, and Minister of Public Works. He participated in the 1947 negotiations between Indonesia and the Netherlands on the "Renville" transport ship, under the auspices of the United Nations, and in the 1949 Indonesian-Dutch Round Table Conference in The Hague, where he chaired the Finance Committee.

    In Indonesia's past sixteen cabinets, Djuanda has served twelve times, primarily as Minister of Transportation or Minister of Economy. In the second Ali Sastroamidjojo cabinet formed in March of last year, he served as Minister of National Planning; after Masjumi party's Wiweko resigned as Minister of Finance, Djuanda concurrently held that ministerial post. He was a key decision-maker in Indonesia's first Five-Year Development Plan (1956-1960).

    In recent years, Djuanda has participated in numerous diplomatic activities. In December 1951, he led the Indonesian delegation to Japan to negotiate Japan's compensation to Indonesia and economic and trade issues between the two countries. In the same year, he visited West Germany at the invitation of West German Chancellor Adenauer. In May 1955, Djuanda, as the then-Director of the Indonesian National Planning Bureau, accompanied Sastroamidjojo on a visit to our country. (Xinhua News Agency)
