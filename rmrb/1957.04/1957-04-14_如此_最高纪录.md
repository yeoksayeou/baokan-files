    Such a "Highest Record"
    Recently, a book called "Highest Record" was published in Britain. It says: the largest robbery in the world was committed by a group of American soldiers in West Germany in 1945, who robbed a total of 730 gold bars, six bags of cash, and twenty-five boxes of platinum bars and jewels. The person with the most bigamous marriages in the world is Mrs. Theresa Vaughan of Sheffield, England, who remarried sixty-one times in five years.
