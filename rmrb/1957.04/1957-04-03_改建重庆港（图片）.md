    Reconstructing Chongqing Port
    Chongqing Port is a transportation hub in Southwest China, with millions of tons of goods entering, leaving, and being transshipped here every year. However, due to the narrow river channel and years of silt accumulation, large ships can only anchor in the middle of the river during the dry season, relying on transshipment to load and unload goods. This greatly increases the workload of the port and affects ship turnaround. To change this situation, Chongqing Port is undergoing reconstruction.

    改建重庆港
    重庆港是西南交通运输枢纽，每年有几百万吨物资从这里进出和转运。但是重庆港由于河槽狭窄和历年泥沙淤积，每到枯水季节，大型轮船就只能停泊在江心，依靠转驳装卸货物，因此大大增加港口的工作量，影响船舶周转。为了改变这种现象，重庆港正进行改建。
