    Communist Party member Yin Yonglin is a fourth-grade milling machine operator in the large parts workshop of the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant. He is diligent in production but doesn't have many technical tricks. His base salary is over 60 yuan. Now, with the old quotas set in September of last year, his monthly income, including overtime and night shift allowances, ranges from 90 to 110 yuan. At the beginning of February this year, when settling his January salary, he suddenly received 283 yuan, a wage far higher than that of any advanced worker in the factory, something he himself hadn't anticipated.

    "What do you think we should do?"

    The entire workshop and the entire factory immediately buzzed with discussion. Some suspected him of cheating, others thought he was taking advantage of his apprentices (according to regulations, if apprentices exceed their quota, a small portion – 10% to 25% – of their piece-rate wages is awarded to the supervising technical worker). Some workers who often earned overtime pay remarked, "If you're active in your work and exceed the quota, you should get paid for it." Some workshop staff sighed, "It's better to be a piece-rate worker; no matter how active we are, we can't get that much money."

    Party Branch Secretary Zhou Qianghua, together with the workshop deputy director, the quota setter, and Yin Yonglin himself, reviewed his work in January to see why he had exceeded the quota by so much. The conclusion was that he had not cheated, nor had he improved his operating techniques or increased his labor intensity. The main reason was that the quota was too unreasonable. The most common type of grinding machine bed he made that month had an extra allowance for three table checks in the quota. Another process, milling grooves, originally required milling four times, but now, with a new type of milling cutter, only required milling once. In just these two items, the quota allowed for several tens of minutes more processing time per piece. In addition, he processed fewer types of parts, larger batches, and the apprentices exceeded their quotas by a lot, which suddenly increased his income by such a large amount.

    He said to the branch secretary, "What do you think we should do? There's a lot of gossip. Should I take the money?"

    The branch secretary said, "What do you think you should do?"

    Yin Yonglin hesitated for a moment, then smiled and said, "It's difficult, though. I didn't cheat."

    "The money was issued according to the system, and you've already taken it. The question is, what should a Communist Party member do when faced with this situation? Think about it and talk to everyone about your thoughts when you have a chance," the branch secretary said. At that moment, he had a plan. The September quotas were due to be revised. Since Yin Yonglin's situation had already caused so much discussion, it was a good opportunity to conduct a discussion on the correct handling of the conflict between individual immediate interests and the long-term interests of the country, to better prepare for this quota revision.

    **A Demobilized Soldier's Words**

    A few days later, a branch meeting was held, with ten non-Party activists invited to participate. Yin Yonglin first explained the actual situation of the excessive overtime pay, then said, "The quota has a problem, but I didn't cheat, and I took the money that was issued. Now I'm not sure whether I should have taken it or not. Let's discuss it."

    The discussion was unprecedentedly lively.

    Some Party members' statements were like this:

    "More overtime and more money is a good phenomenon. The Party branch got scared when they saw he took 283 yuan. That's conservative thinking!"

    "Is this supposed to be criticism or praise? He didn't cheat!"

    "The quota is unreasonable, it's not his fault."

    Four or five Party members said that such an unreasonable quota was a loss to the country, and that Party members should openly raise it and demand that the quota be revised. However, these were usually quiet Party members, and their voices didn't prevail at the time. Some retorted, "There's no precedent for that." Most people were just arguing about "should he have taken the money?" and "who is responsible for the unreasonable quota?" The debate lasted until after 9:00 p.m.

    In the meantime, the non-Party member and demobilized soldier Li Wenxiao said something that startled everyone: "It's clearly an unreasonable phenomenon, and a Communist Party member takes the money with eyes wide shut, which shows a low level of awareness!"

    The meeting adjourned late at night, and the Party members still had these words ringing in their ears. The branch secretary felt heavily the consequences of relaxing political and ideological education in the past year.

    **Forgetting Four Words**

    From the next day, the branch secretary held four or five small forums in a row, encouraging the workers to continue their self-education, with non-Party activists also participating. In these forums, those who were paid salaries instead of piece-rate wages spoke relatively objectively. Old crane operator Chen Linhua's frank question once awakened many people. He said:

    "Who is to blame for the unreasonable quota? Of course not Yin Yonglin. But what if the quota is set too tight and we can't make a living? What should we do then?"

    Some workers blurted out, "That won't work, of course we have to change it."

    "Oh, so if the quota is set too loosely and calculated incorrectly, then we don't care?"

    The question was so sharp, who is the master of the factory? What should Communist Party members do in particular? Every Party member needed to answer these questions. A Party member who had hotly debated at the previous branch meeting said to the branch secretary: "We argued all night at the branch meeting. The problem is that we forgot four words: 'Communist Party member!' We shouldn't just see that there's money to be made and not care whether the quota is reasonable. That's a loss to the country."

    The Party members all said that this was truly a lesson in communism.

    Such discussions, from within the Party to outside the Party, were published on the workshop bulletin board. Scriber Zhou Jinde wrote an article saying that a certain grinding machine headstock quota had an extra scribing hour calculated into it, and requested that it be revised. At least six Party members took the same action. Then, Youth League member Zhu Shengfa also publicly said that for the 28 slides he made, he was sure to exceed the quota even if he slept for two days, given the current quota.

    **Working Hours Reduced by More Than 30%**

    Gradually, the atmosphere of correctly handling the relationship between individual interests and national interests prevailed in the workshop. Earning more through technical improvements was glorious; relying on outdated quotas to earn more money was not the attitude of the working class as masters of the country. After half a month, the conditions for reasonably revising the quota matured.

    Another branch meeting was held. The branch secretary reported on the implementation of the old quota from September of last year. Currently, the entire workshop's average working hours exceeded the quota by 49%, and the workers' average wage income exceeded their base salary by even more. This not only increased the factory's costs but also affected the improvement of technology. Everyone was sure to get overtime pay, and they were careless in their work. Sometimes, waiting for work and materials wasn't even that important. This also affected improvements in management work. When the group discussion began, all thirty-eight Party members actively supported revising the quota. Then, when the workshop workers discussed revising the quota together, they and the masses proactively found out the unreasonable parts of the old quota. The new quota, which was discussed and approved by everyone, reduced working hours by more than 30% on average compared to the old quota and was decided to be implemented starting April 1st.

    一个共产党员的额外收入
    新华社记者　徐中尼
    共产党员殷永林，上海机床厂大件车间的四级铣工，平时生产勤恳，技术上窍门不多。基本工资是六十多元，现在实行去年9月份订的老定额，每月工作超额加上夜班津贴等，收入在九十到一百一十元之间。今年2月初结算1月份工资，突然拿到了二百八十三元，这笔比全厂任何先进工人多得多的工资，连他自己也没有料到。
    “你看怎么办？”
    全车间和全厂立刻议论纷纷。有的猜疑他弄虚作假，有的认为他多占了徒工的便宜（按规定，徒工超额，有一小部分——10％到25％的计件工资奖给搭班的技术工人），一些常拿超额工资的工人反映说：“做生活积极，超额多少就该拿多少。”有的车间职员叹气说：“还是做计件工资的工人好，我们随便怎样积极，拿不到这许多钞票。”
    党支部书记周强华会同车间副主任、定额员和殷永林本人，一起查了下他1月份的工作，看看为什么超额这末多？结论是：他并没有弄虚作假，但也没有改进操作技术或提高劳动强度，主要是定额太不合理。这个月他做得最多的一种磨床台面，定额里多算了三次拷表的时间，另一道工序——铣槽，原来铣四刀，现在换了一种铣刀，只铣一刀。仅只两项，定额里算的加工时间每只多算了好几十分钟。加上这个月给他加工的品种少、批量大，徒工超额也多，就突然增加了这末多的一笔收入。
    他对支部书记说：“你看怎么办？大家闲话蛮多，要不要拿？”
    支部书记说：“你自己看怎么办？”
    殷永林犹豫一阵，笑笑说：“倒是难啦，我又没有弄虚作假。”
    “钱是照制度发的，拿也拿了，问题是一个共产党员碰到这种情况应该怎么办？你回去想想，有机会跟大家谈谈自己的感想吧。”支部书记这时心里有了打算，按规定就要修订去年9月份的定额了，既然殷永林的事已经引起人们纷纷议论，正好通过这件事给大家进行一次正确处理个人眼前利益和国家长远利益的矛盾的讨论，更好地酝酿这次的修改定额。
    转业军人的一句话
    几天后的一个晚上，开支部大会，邀请十位党外积极分子参加。殷永林先把超额多的实际情况讲明了，然后他说：“定额是有问题的，不过我没有弄虚作假，发的钱我也拿了。现在我也不顶清楚，究竟该拿不该拿。大家讨论吧。”
    讨论得空前的热烈。
    一部分党员的发言是这样的：
    “多超额、多拿钱是好现象，党支部看到他拿了二百八十三元就怕起来了，这是保守思想！”
    “今天算是批评还是表扬？他又没弄虚作假！”
    “定额不合理，不是他的错。”
    有四五个党员表示，定额这样不合理，对国家是损失，党员应该公开提出来，要求修改定额。可是这些都是平时不会讲话的党员，当时发言占不了上风。有的反驳说“没有这样的先例”。多数人只是在争“该不该拿这笔钱”和“定额不合理该谁负责”。争论一直延长到晚上九点多。
    其间，非党员转业军人李文孝曾经说了句使大家一怔的话，他说：“明明是不合理现象，共产党员眼开眼闭地拿钞票，说明觉悟水平不高！”
    夜深散会，党员们耳朵里还响着这句话。支部书记沉重地感到去年一年放松了政治思想教育的后果。
    忘记了四个字
    第二天起，支部书记连续开了四五次小型座谈会，启发工人们继续进行自我教育，非党员积极分子也参加。在这些座谈会中，说话比较客观的是不按计件制拿工资的工人。行车老工人陈林华一次坦直的发问使许多人清醒了。他说：
    “定额不合理，谁的错？当然不是殷永林。可是定额如果订得太紧，生活做不出，怎样办？”
    一些工人脱口说：“那不行，当然要改。”
    “噢，那末定额订得太松，算错了，就不管了？”
    问题是这样的尖锐，谁是工厂的主人？特别是共产党员该怎么办？每个党员需要回答这些问题。曾经在前一次支部大会上热烈争论过的党员对支部书记说：“支部大会上争了一晚，毛病出在忘记了四个字——共产党员！不应该看到有钞票拿，就不管定额是否合理。这是国家的损失。”
    党员们都说这真正上了共产主义的一课。
    这样的讨论，从党内到党外，车间黑板报上公布了党内讨论的情况。划线工周金德写稿说，他做的一种磨床头架的定额，多算了一道划线工时，要求修改。至少有六个党员采取了同样的行动。接着青年团员朱生法也公开说，他做的二十八只拖板，照现在的定额，就是睡两天觉也笃定超额。
    工时压缩了30％多
    渐渐地，车间里正确处理个人利益和国家利益之间关系的风气占了优势。凭技术改进而超额多得是光荣，靠定额落后多拿钞票不是工人阶级的主人翁态度。经过半个月，合理修改定额的条件成熟了。
    又一次召开了支部大会。支部书记报告去年9月的老定额实行情况，现在，全车间平均工时超额49％，工人工资收入平均比基本工资超额得还要多。不仅增加了工厂的成本，而且影响到技术的提高。大家笃定有超额工资拿，做生活马虎了，有时等工待料也不十分计较，这样又影响到管理工作的改进。当分组讨论的时候，全体三十八个党员有三十七个积极拥护修改定额。接着当车间全体工人讨论修改定额的时候，他们和群众一起，把老定额中不合理的部分主动地找出来了。大家讨论通过的新定额，平均比老定额压缩工时30％以上，决定从4月1日开始实行。　（原载解放日报）
