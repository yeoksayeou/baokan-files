The Railway System Decides to Implement a System of Division of Responsibilities Under the Collective Leadership of the Party Committee
Further Strengthening the Party's Leadership over Railway Enterprises

(Reported by our newspaper) According to the People's Railway News: The Political Department of the Ministry of Railways recently convened a meeting of Party Committee (Party Group) secretaries from all railway bureaus (companies, institutes) across the country. The meeting reviewed and summarized the Party's leadership in the railway system and several policy issues, and proposed the guiding principles for future work.

The meeting believed that over the past eight years, under the leadership of the Central Committee and the leadership and assistance of local Party committees at all levels, Party organizations at all levels across the railway system have basically implemented the policy of wholeheartedly relying on the working class to run enterprises well and the Party's policies in various periods, achieving great results. However, due to the past few years, while strengthening the centralized and unified management of administrative work, the comprehensive leadership role of the enterprise Party committee over the enterprise and the traditional experience of the Party's collective leadership were neglected. The responsibilities of the railway enterprise Party committee for production and administrative work were wrongly defined as guaranteeing and supervising. In addition, the Party committees of some railway administrations were abolished and changed to Party groups, and the "one-chief system" was inappropriately promoted in the railway system, which weakened the Party's leadership role and fueled the development of subjective, bureaucratic, and commanding work styles among cadres. In order to strengthen the Party's comprehensive leadership role over enterprises, it is necessary to implement the leadership system of "collective leadership of the Party committee as the core combined with individual responsibility" in the future, eliminate the negative impact of the one-chief system, and establish and improve Party committees at all levels of railway enterprises; and further strengthen the Party's leadership over trade unions and the Communist Youth League.

The meeting believed that relying on the working class and implementing the mass line is an extremely important issue in whether enterprises can be run well. It is necessary to improve the enterprise's democratic management system, change the existing workers' representative conferences into workers' representative congresses, and appropriately expand their powers; it is necessary to care for the lives of workers, while promoting the spirit of cadres sharing weal and woe with the masses, and constantly conducting education on building the country and running enterprises diligently and thriftily, and on hard work and plain living among workers; it is necessary to strengthen the political, cultural, and technical education of workers to meet the growing needs of the railway transportation industry; it is also necessary to strengthen the unity within railway workers, strengthen the unity of railway workers with workers in fraternal enterprises, and strengthen the unity of railway workers with peasants, and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.

The meeting pointed out that due to the excessive concentration of power in the past, the full exertion of the initiative of lower levels was affected. In the future, it is necessary to improve the railway administrative management system and appropriately expand the authority of each bureau.

The meeting reviewed several guidelines and policies regarding railway transportation and construction. The meeting pointed out that the basic task of the railway is to guarantee the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing transportation needs of the country and the people with the least consumption of manpower and material resources on the basis of continuous adoption of new technologies. Therefore, it is necessary to comprehensively consider the railway transportation plan and the railway construction plan based on the requirements of the national political and economic tasks, the scale of economic construction development, the deployment of productive forces, and the laws of economic development in various periods, and properly arrange the work of various departments. The slogan "new lines first" put forward in 1953, which excessively emphasized the importance of the new lines department, was incorrect. Secondly, the slogan "first seek accessibility, then seek completeness" in new line construction is also inappropriate. "First seek accessibility, then seek completeness" can be used for emergency repairs of damaged lines, but it is wrong to use it for new line construction because this will reduce the quality of the project and increase work-related injuries.

The meeting called on leaders throughout the railway system to earnestly study Marxism-Leninism and the Party's policies, constantly delve into reality and the masses, overcome subjectivism and bureaucracy, improve their leadership level, and achieve correct leadership.

    铁路系统决定实行党委集体领导下的分工负责制
    进一步加强党对铁路企业的领导
    本报讯　据人民铁道报报道：铁道部政治部最近召开了全路各局（公司、院）党委（党组）书记会议。会议对铁路系统党的领导问题和几个政策问题作了检查总结，提出了今后的工作方针。
    会议认为，八年来全路各级党的组织，在中央的领导下，和地方各级党委的领导与帮助下，基本上贯彻执行了全心全意依靠工人阶级办好企业的方针和党在各个时期的政策，取得了很大的成绩。但是，由于过去几年来，在加强行政工作集中统一管理的同时，忽视了企业党委对企业的全面领导作用和党的集体领导的传统经验，错误地把铁路企业党委对生产行政工作的职责规定为保证监督，又撤消了部分管理局的党委改为党组，并在铁路系统不恰当地推行了一长制，因而削弱了党的领导作用，助长了干部的主观主义、官僚主义和命令主义思想作风的发展。为了加强党对企业的全面领导作用，今后必须贯彻执行“以党委为核心的集体领导和个人负责相结合”的领导制度，肃清一长制的不良影响，建立和健全各级铁路企业党的委员会；并要进一步加强党对工会和青年团的领导。
    会议认为：依靠工人阶级，贯彻执行群众路线，是能否办好企业的一个极端重要的问题。必须改进企业的民主管理制度，把现有的职工代表会议改为职工代表大会，并适当地扩大它的权力；必须关心职工生活，同时要发扬干部同群众同甘共苦的精神，并在职工中经常进行勤俭建国，勤俭办企业，艰苦朴素的教育；必须加强工人的政治、文化和技术的教育，使之适应铁路运输事业日益发展的需要；还必须加强铁路工人内部的团结，加强铁路职工同兄弟企业职工的团结，加强铁路职工同农民的团结，巩固工农联盟。
    会议指出：由于过去事权过分集中，影响了下级积极性的充分发挥，今后必须改进铁路行政管理的体制，适当扩大各局的权限。
    会议对于铁路运输和建设方面的几个方针政策问题作了检查。会议指出：铁路的基本任务是：在不断采用新技术的基础上，以最少的人力和物力的消耗，来保证最大限度地满足国家和人民经常增长的运输需要。所以必须根据各个时期国家政治经济任务的要求、经济建设发展的规模、生产力的部署以及经济发展的规律，来统盘考虑铁路运输计划和铁路建设计划，妥善地安排各个部门的工作。1953年提出的“新线第一”的口号，过分强调了新线部门的重要性，是不对的。其次，新线建设中，“先求其通，后求其备”的口号，也是不妥当的。“先求其通，后求其备”用于非常时期抢修被破坏的线路，是可以的，但用于新线建设则是错误的。因为这会降低工程质量，增加工伤事故。
    会议号召全路领导人员认真学习马克思列宁主义和党的政策，经常地深入实际，深入群众，克服主观主义，官僚主义，提高领导水平，实现正确的领导。
