    Looking for Wild Horses
    Tan Bangjie

    Last summer, the wild horse collection team dispatched by the Beijing Zoo sent a premature good news from Xinjiang: they had captured several "wild horses." The news reached Professor Zimmermann, a German zoologist who was visiting China at the time. During an academic report meeting, he specifically expressed his congratulations on this good news, and said that he would take this good news back to Europe, because "many people in Europe are concerned about whether the only remaining wild horse in the world has become extinct."

    The world attaches such importance to wild horses, so the results of their collection are not only of concern to the Chinese zoological community, but also to the zoological communities of various countries in the world. The wild horse is the ancestor of the domestic horse. There used to be many kinds of wild horses in ancient times, but they have all died out one after another. The only remaining species today is the Mongolian wild horse, also known as Przewalski's horse, because it was first introduced to the scientific community by the Russian traveler and naturalist Przewalski in 1880 (the model specimen he brought back is now in the Zoological Museum of the Academy of Sciences in Leningrad). Everyone has a nostalgic heart. People once regretted that the aurochs (the ancestor of domestic cattle) became extinct in the seventeenth century, so they feel even more precious about the remaining wild horses.

    According to the investigation of the zoological community, the distribution area of ​​existing wild horses is very narrow, limited to the border area between Xinjiang and Mongolia. Przewalski's specimens (a skull and a skin) were obtained from the edge of the Junggar Basin. In history, there have only been two instances of hunting wild horses: the first time was at the end of the 19th century, when the Russian aristocratic naturalist Vozfanen sent people to capture a small batch and raised them in his villa in Crimea. The second time was in 1900, when the collection team sent by the famous German animal tamer Haikinberg (zoo director, circus owner, and animal trader) also captured a batch. The capture location was in the Kobdo River Valley on the northern slope of the Altai Mountains near the Xinjiang border (48 degrees north latitude, 90 degrees 35 minutes east longitude). A total of fifty-two horses were captured the second time, but on the way back, they traveled thousands of miles, dying along the way. It took eleven months to return to Hamburg, Germany, leaving only twenty-eight horses. The few wild horses kept in major zoos in Europe and the United States today are the remnants of this batch.

    Since 1900, half a century has passed, and there has been no news about wild horses in the wild. The distribution area was originally small and the number was very small, and the order in Xinjiang has been disrupted repeatedly. This cannot but arouse people's speculation and worry, and some even believe that it has become extinct. For example, Dr. Antonio of Vienna, an authority on ungulate animals, once made such a statement.

    Whether it is really extinct? This can only be determined after an on-the-spot investigation. But perhaps many people will raise such opinions: After liberation, with the advancement of various survey teams entering Xinjiang and Tibet, hadn't there been repeated news of "wild horses"? Haven't survey team members or exploration team members personally shot and eaten the meat of "wild horses"? Isn't there a "wild horse beach" in the Qaidam Basin where a large number of wild horses appear?

    However, all of this is just a misunderstanding. It turned out that the four "wild horses" captured by the zoo collection team in Xinjiang in June last year were not real wild horses. After being brought back to Beijing, they were found to be Mongolian wild asses; and the two animals obtained by another team in western Qinghai were also wild asses (Tibetan wild asses). People in the Northwest call them "wild horses". In Qinghai, some people even call it "White Dragon Horse," meaning that the "horse" that Tang Monk rode to the Western Heaven to obtain scriptures was this kind of "horse."

    Although wild horses and wild asses are quite similar in external morphology, there are still many important differences. Because it involves the issue of animal classification, it would take a long time to explain, so it is not necessary to elaborate here. However, although there is only a one-word difference between donkey and horse, their values ​​are very different. Wild horses are one of the most precious animals today, while wild asses are much less so, mainly because the number of wild asses is still large (large groups of hundreds or thousands may be found in some seasons), and their distribution is very wide, not only widely distributed in Xinjiang, Qinghai, Tibet, etc., but also live in Iran, Afghanistan, Syria, and so on. Because things are not rare, they are not so valuable.

    Even so, the Beijing Zoo's collection team went to great lengths to capture wild asses last year. Because compared to the era when Haikinberg captured wild horses, more than half a century has passed, but before the railway was built to the interior of Xinjiang, the climate, transportation, accommodation, diet and other conditions there were still similar to the past. Last year, the collection team's activities were in the desert grasslands north of Qitai, east of Junggar, near Beitashan. The only mode of transportation was horseback riding. Often there were no signs of human habitation for one or two hundred miles. Once they lost their way or encountered bad weather, the situation became even more difficult. Some of the collection team members went hungry for two or three days without eating a grain of rice; others spent the night in the open air in heavy snow at minus thirty degrees Celsius.

    In order to find wild horses, the collection team has set off again. This time the preparations are better than last time, but there must still be many difficulties. The main difficulty is: Where can we find wild horses? There was not much certainty before departure. Since Beitashan has been proven to have none, this time we can only continue to advance north, all the way to the southern foot of the Altai Mountains in the northernmost part of Xinjiang, which is only separated from the Kobdo River Valley by a mountain, and the possibility is the greatest. The team members believe that as long as there are still wild horses living in northern Xinjiang, they will eventually find them one day, and after finding them, capturing them will be a relatively simple matter. The breeding period for wild horses is in late April and the first half of May, so May and June are the most ideal seasons for capturing wild horses. After this period, the young wild horses gradually grow up and are difficult to capture alive.

    寻找野马
    谭邦杰
    去年夏季，北京动物园派出去的野马搜集队由新疆发出了一个过早的喜讯：捕获了几匹“野马”。消息传到了适在我国访问中的德国动物学家齐莫曼教授的耳中。他在一次学术报告会中，对这件喜讯特别表示祝贺之意，并且说要把这喜讯带回欧洲去，因为“欧洲有很多人都在关心世界上仅存的一种野马到底绝种了没有。”
    世人这样重视野马，因此他们搜集的成果如何，不仅为我国动物学界所关心，而且也为世界各国动物学界所注意。野马是家马的祖先。古代曾有许多种野马，但早已陆续死绝了，现代残存者只剩下这一种，即：蒙古野马，又名普氏野马，因为它是1880年由俄国旅行家兼自然学家普尔采瓦斯基氏首先介绍给科学界的（他带回国的模式标本现存列宁格勒的科学院动物博物馆中）。怀旧之心，人皆有之。人们曾经痛惜原牛（家牛的祖先）已在十七世纪中绝种，因此对于残存的野马，更是弥觉珍贵了。
    根据动物学界的调查，现存的野马分布地区非常狭隘，仅限于新疆、蒙古的边境一带。普氏所得的标本（一个头骨，一张皮）是得自准噶尔盆地的边缘。在历史上，捕猎野马之举只曾有过两次：第一次是在十九世纪末叶，俄国的贵族自然学家佛兹范恩曾派人捕获了一小批，养在克里米亚他的别墅内。第二次是1900年德国著名的驯兽家海京伯（动物园长、马戏班主兼动物买卖商）派来的采集队，也捕获了一批。捕获的地点都是在靠近新疆边境阿尔泰山北麓的科布多河谷
  （北纬四十八度，东经九十度三十五分）。第二次共捕获五十二匹，但是在归途中，万里跋涉，一路走一路死，走了十一个月才返回德国汉堡，死剩二十八匹。现在欧、美各国大动物园中所养的少数野马，都是这一批的孑遗。
    自1900年以后，半个世纪过去了，野生的野马究竟如何，竟然毫无消息。分布区本来就狭小，数量又很少，新疆的秩序也曾一再纷乱过。这就不能不引起人们种种揣测和担忧，甚至有人认为它已灭绝了。例如研究有蹄类动物的权威、维也纳的安托尼奥博士就曾如此论述过。
    是否真的灭绝了？这还需要实地调查后才能断定。但是也许会有很多人提出这样的意见：解放后，随着入新、入藏的各种调查队的前进，不是曾经一再传来“野马”的消息么？不是还曾有调查队员或钻探队员亲手射获过“野马”而且吃过它的肉么？不是柴达木盆地中还有一处有大批野马出没的“野马滩”么？
    但，这种种只不过是一个误会。原来动物园采集队去年6月间在新疆捕获的四匹“野马”并不是真的野马，带回北京后一看才知道是蒙古野驴；而另一队人由青海西部得到的两匹也是野驴（西藏野驴）。西北人都把它叫做“野马”。在青海甚至有人叫它为“白龙马”，意思是说：唐僧上西天取经时所骑的就是这种“马”。
    野马和野驴虽然在外部形态上颇多相似，然究竟还是有不少重要区别的。因牵涉到动物分类的问题，讲起来话长，这里就不必细表了。但驴、马虽一字之差，在价值上却大不相同。野马是现代最珍贵的动物之一，野驴则差得多，主要是因为野驴的数量还很多（在某些季节中可能发现成千成百的大群），且分布很广，不但广泛分布于新疆、青海、西藏等地，同时也生存在伊朗、阿富汗、叙利亚等等地方。物既不稀，所以就不那么贵了。
    尽管如此，北京动物园的采集队去年捕猎野驴确也费了千辛万苦。因为比起海京伯捕野马的时代，时间固已过去半个多世纪，但是在铁路线没有修到新疆内地去之前，那里的气候、交通、住宿、饮食等条件与过去也还相差不多。采集队去年的活动范围是在奇台北面、准噶尔东面、靠近北塔山一带的荒漠草原上，唯一的交通方式是骑马，往往一二百里地不见人烟，一旦迷失了方向或遇见变天，处境就更艰难。采集队员中就有人饿了两三天，粒米未进；也有的曾在零下三十多度的大雪天里，露天过夜。
    为了找寻野马，现在采集队又出发了。这次的准备工作比上次强一些，但是困难一定还很多。最主要的困难是：究竟在那里能找到野马呢？出发前可谓没有多大把握。北塔山一带既然已证明没有，这次只能继续北进，一直找到新疆最北部的阿尔泰山南麓，那里与科布多河谷只有一山之隔，可能性比较最大。队员们相信，只要北疆还有野马生存，就终有找到它的一日，而找到之后，捕捉就是比较简单的事了。野马的生育期是在4月下旬和5月的前半个月，因此5、6月间是捕捉野马的最理想的季节，过此以后，小野马渐渐长大，就很难活捉了。
