(Reported by this newspaper) The more than 90,000 mu of small spring crops in Hanshou County, Hunan Province, promise a good harvest. All 397 agricultural cooperatives in the county are seizing the time to sort out the work points of cooperative members and all income and expenditure accounts in order to prepare for formulating preliminary distribution plans for the small spring crops. As of April 4th, about 40% of the cooperatives have completed the clearing of work points and accounts before March, and have announced and verified them with the cooperative members.

In the work of clearing work points and income and expenditure accounts, all townships have given full play to the role of accounting mutual aid groups and mutual aid networks. All twenty-eight financial and accounting instructors in the county have also gone deep into key cooperatives or those with relatively backward financial and accounting work to provide specific guidance.

    汉寿县各地农业社
    积极进行预分准备工作
    本报讯　湖南省汉寿县九万多亩小春作物，丰收在望。全县三百九十七个农业社，正抓紧清理社员工分和所有往来收支账目，以便做好制定小春作物预分方案前的各项准备工作。截至本月4日止，已有40％左右的社，结束了3月份以前的工分、账目清理工作，并向社员作了公布和核对。
    各乡在清理工分和往来收支账目工作中，充分发挥了会计互助组和互助网的作用。全县二十八个财会辅导员，也都深入到重点或财会工作比较后进的社进行具体辅导。
