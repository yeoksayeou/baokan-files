    On the Performance of "Picking Up the Painting and Calling Out the Painting"
    Bai Yunsheng

    "Picking Up the Painting and Calling Out the Painting" originally consisted of two scenes in the Peony Pavilion script, but is now combined into one act. It is a solo performance for a young male role, lasting as long as forty minutes on stage.

    This play has not been performed in the South for over twenty years, and has not been performed in the North for a long time either. Since I began performing young male roles, I have felt that this play requires a high level of artistry in terms of young male role performance. I rehearsed this play in 1936, but because no one had performed it before, I had no way to observe and learn. I could only familiarize myself with the music first. As the saying goes, "Practice makes perfect," so I sang it repeatedly. I also had the famous flute master Xu Huiru play the flute for me, so that I could skillfully use the techniques in the music. As for the meaning of the lyrics, because my cultural level was not high enough, I had to ask famous literary figures to explain them to me. Then, based on the meaning of the words, I designed the dance, movements, and posture of the body, and how to express the scene of an imagined desolate garden and the emotional changes towards a beautiful woman in a painting.

    This play is performed as a separate program, but the original dialogue does not adequately explain how Liu Mengmei came to Nan'an. I myself added a few sentences: "Going to the capital to take the exam, he encountered a pirate ship on the way and was pushed into the river. He was rescued by Mr. Chen and is now recuperating in the Plum Blossom Temple." This makes the explanation clear. If the entire play is performed, there is no need for this introduction, but the entire play has not been performed for a long time. This kind of introductory dialogue should be coordinated with the literary meaning of the entire play, and should not be too long.

    To play Liu Mengmei, a scholar, one must grasp his elegant and refined demeanor and his honest and affectionate character. According to the plot, Liu Mengmei is in a state of recovery from a serious illness and is also a guest in a foreign land. It is a time of bright spring, so he goes to the garden for a walk to relieve his sorrow. In the opening lines, there are the sentences, "Who is like me in admiring the spring, as a guest I do not ask about anything else," which summarize his lonely feelings of being sick in a foreign land. When I play Liu Mengmei, I grasp his state of being newly recovered from a serious illness. His eyes should be somewhat unfocused, his steps should be softer, and his voice should be weak, as if he is panting. This expression is very difficult to perform. In general, the young male roles in most plays are full of energy when they appear, in order to attract the audience. But in this play, the subtle emotions of Liu Mengmei's recovery from a long illness must be performed extremely delicately. Without careful understanding, it is impossible to grasp it.

    The four lines of poetry, "The fragrance of pear blossoms in the spring courtyard is gentle," describe the spring. When reciting this line, the nostrils should quiver slightly, making an expression of smelling the fragrance of flowers. "A year's sorrows are spent in deliberation," thinking that the year has just begun, and already there are sorrows. The face immediately shows a slight sadness. "I wonder how much willow thoughts can be," comparing one's own sorrow to willow thoughts. "Fight Shen Lang by gathering one's strength," rallying one's spirits to fight against sorrow and illness. When reciting this line, the spirit should be a little more vigorous. In these short four lines of poetry, there are very complex changes in facial expression and eyes. Arriving outside the garden gate, the dialogue is, "What a verdant bamboo fence, it's a pity that half of it has fallen down, I must go in for a stroll." Since half of the fence has fallen down, it is naturally inconvenient to enter and exit, so he steps sideways with his left leg, using the right sleeve to protect his head, then steps with his right leg, using the left sleeve to protect his head, and chooses his path, expressing the desolate condition of the abandoned garden.

    "The railing is still a jade railing, I can't bear to look at the surrounding walls, I can imagine the good scenery at that time, ten thousand strands of mist shrouded it all at once." When reciting these four lines, one must look left and right to express emotion. Singing the tune name "Good Things Approaching," "Then I see the scenery fading away, west of the painted wall, south side left, slippery moss." These three lines of lyrics describe the direction of the garden. The action is to put both hands behind the back, facing the left stage corner at an oblique angle, then take a step back, double throw the sleeves, indicating that the former splendor of the garden has disappeared. Singing "west of the painted wall," point with both fingers towards the lower stage door oblique corner. "South side left," lift the right foot, extend both palms in a watching gesture. Discovering that the flower path along the wall is covered with moss because no one has been to the garden for a long time, the movements and steps are: lift the robe with both hands, walk carefully and still almost fall, make a slipping and dodging posture, the face slightly panicked, and use the sleeves to brush the edge of the robe, indicating that the moss has stained the clothes. "Leaning against broken walls and low dikes," the action is to use the right sleeve to protect the head, fold the left sleeve back, and the eyes focus intently, making the audience notice that it is close to the broken wall opening. When singing "low dikes," use a double sleeve flick, stand on the right leg, lift the left leg with the boot tip to pick up the edge of the robe, making a slight squatting gesture to indicate the height of the wall. "Why is the butterfly door closed," at this time the eyes look back, discover that the doors are falling down, facing forward, fold both arms back with the sleeves, the hands gradually merge, then throw down the sleeves, slowly lower the arms. This posture, combined with the lyrics, makes the audience understand that the doors have fallen down, then slowly turn around and make a leisurely stroll posture, facing the upper stage door corner, discovering a bamboo forest, with inscriptions left by passers-by. The words carved on the bamboo must be very small, the eyes should pay attention to careful viewing, the body slightly moving, expressing surprise. Continuing to sing, "Visitors come and go, many years have passed, carving all the countless fine bamboos," walking from the upper stage corner towards the lower stage door left corner, indicating a bamboo forest. "Early on, cold flowers surrounded the steps, and desolate weeds formed nests," walking from the left side to the right side in a zigzag pattern, indicating a winding path, and pointing out the condition of desolate weeds forming nests to the left and right corners of the front stage with gestures, and brushing the clothes with the sleeves, indicating that they are stained with broken grass. At this time, facing forward, slowly turn around and look to the left, suddenly seeing a mountain stone that is very exquisite, although it has collapsed, it is still eye-catching. While admiring it, he discovers something under the mountain stone, so he pushes aside the floating soil and pulls out a painting scroll, gently brushing it with the sleeves, making a covering face gesture, the mouth making a light blowing gesture, the head slightly tilted, and slightly closing the eyes, indicating that dust is flying, then using the sleeves to wipe the painting scroll and dust from his body. Opening it, he sees a small painting, but he has not looked at it carefully, so he mistakenly thinks it is a Guan Yin (Goddess of Mercy) portrait, holding the painting with both hands, turning the wrist to make the picture face outward, so that the audience can see it clearly. When rolling the painting, it is necessary to grasp the two sides of the painting axis and roll them evenly, and also to make the hand gestures beautiful.

    Singing the tune name "Thousand Autumn Years," "A small mountain rock, presses down on the sandalwood box," meaning that there is a box for holding Buddha statues under the mountain stone. But on stage, a box is not used, as using a box would be difficult to handle in the performance. The gesture when singing this line is to hold the painting with the right hand, and use a circulating finger twice with the left hand at an angle, indicating that the mountain stone is pressing on the box. "It has become a beautiful Guan Yin pavilion," holding the painting scroll with both hands, raising it to the left side of the face, indicating respect and praise for Guan Yin. The same is done on the right side of the face, in order to make the movements symmetrical. "Before the stone peak, before the stone peak," using a sleeve threading, one leg standing independently, the other foot using the boot tip to pick up the edge of the robe, extending both arms slightly bent, making a weathervane posture, indicating the shape of the mountain stone. "Mostly it is a flying stone, a cause and effect of three lifetimes," meaning that he is destined to pick up this painting in front of the stone. The action is to use the right sleeve to protect the head, the eyes making a distant gaze, expressing the desire to recall the stories of the ancients. "Please take it, and pass it over the furnace smoke," facing forward, walking three steps forward, moving the painting up and down with both hands, indicating the meaning of incense smoke lingering. "Head prostrates on the ground, adding lamp fire," holding the painting with the left hand, putting the palm of the right hand on the chest, the body slightly bent, the head slightly lowered, making a Buddhist worship posture. "Shine on him, have mercy on me," raising the painting over the head with both hands, the face joyful. "I offer everything here wholeheartedly, what does he think of it?" At this time, walking from left to right in a zigzag step, making a door-opening gesture, indicating returning to the study.

    On stage, there is only one table and two chairs, but the performance and lyrics include the scenery that the garden should have and its desolate appearance. The pattern shape of all directions on the stage makes it necessary for one person on the stage to take care of everything, no matter how big the stage is, so that no corner is empty. Traditionally, this is called "filling the stage." This section discusses "picking up the painting." (To be continued) (Attached picture)

    谈“拾画叫画”的表演
    白云生
    “拾画叫画”在牡丹亭曲本中原系两折，今合并为一出，是小生独角戏，在舞台上表演达四十分钟之久。
    这出戏在南方已二十余年无人演出，北方亦久无人演。我自改演小生后，感觉到此戏在小生表演方面需要有高度的艺术。1936年即排演此戏，因无人演过，故我也无从观摩学习，只好先将曲子拍熟。俗话说“熟能生巧”，故我反复的唱。又经名笛师徐惠如为我擫笛，能运用曲中巧腔。至于曲词意义，因文化水平不够，只有请教文学界名宿讲解。然后根据词意设计舞蹈、动作、身段的姿式，如何表现一座想像中的荒园情景和对一幅画中美人的情感变化。
    这一出戏作为单独节目来演，按照原本的话白，介绍柳梦梅如何来到南安，写得不够。我自己补充几句是：“上京应考，路遇贼船，推入江中，蒙陈老先生相救，因此在梅花观中养病。”这样便交代清楚。如演全本则不须介绍，但全本久已无人演了。这种介绍的话白与全剧文词意味要协调，更不宜过长。
    演柳梦梅这样一个书生，必须掌握其儒雅潇洒的丰度和敦厚多情的性格。按照剧情，柳梦梅是处在大病初愈，又在客中，时值春光明媚，故到园中散步以解愁闷。在上场引子中有“惊春谁似我，客途中都不问其它”两句，概括他客中卧病的寂寞情怀。我扮柳梦梅出场时，掌握他大病初愈的状态，眼神要发直些，步法要软一些，在唱念声音中要微弱似喘。这个表情很难演。一般戏中的小生多在出场时精神饱满，以吸引观众。但这出戏中要将柳梦梅久病初愈的情绪极其微妙的表演出来，非细心体会，不能了解。
    念四句诗：“脉脉梨花春院香”是说在春天，念这句时鼻翅微动，做出嗅到花香的表情。“一年愁事费商量”，想到一年刚开始，已有愁怀，面部立刻微带愁容。“不知柳思能多少”，以柳思比自己愁绪，“打叠腰肢斗沈郎”，打起精神与愁病做斗争，念到此时，精神要振作一些。在短短四句诗内，面部和眼神有很复杂的变化。及到花园门外，话白是“好个葱翠篱门，可惜倒了半架，不免进去一游”。篱门既然倒了半架，当然出入不便，所以侧身迈左腿，右手水袖护头，再迈右腿用左手水袖护头，并择路而行，表现出废园荒凉的情状。
    “凭栏仍是玉栏杆，四面墙垣不忍看，想得当时好风月，万条烟罩一时乾”。念此四句时要左顾右盼表示感慨。唱曲牌名“好事近”，“则见风月暗消磨，画墙西，正南侧左，苍苔滑擦。”这三句唱词中说明花园的方向，动作上是双背手，面向左台口斜角，然后退一步，双投袖，表示当年园中盛况已经消失了。唱“画墙西”向下场门斜角双手指“正南侧左”抬右脚，伸双掌作看式。发现因园中久无人到，墙边花径布满苍苔，动作步法是：双手提袍，小心行走而仍险跌一交，姿态做滑步闪身，面部略带惊惶，并用水袖拂袍边，表示苍苔沾污了衣服的意思。“倚逗着断垣低垛”，动作上用右手水袖护头，左手反折水袖，眼神用力注视，使观众注意到是挨着残缺的墙口。唱到“低垛”时用双掸袖，右腿独立，左腿挑起袍边作微蹲式表示墙的高矮。“因何蝴蝶门儿落合”，这时眼神向后看，发现双门落下，面向前，双臂反搭水袖，双手渐渐合并，再把水袖甩下，慢慢双臂下垂。这个姿式结合唱词，使观众了解双门已经垂落，再慢慢转身作闲步游赏姿式，面向上场门角发现一片竹林，有过客题名。刻在竹上的字必是很细小，眼神要注意细看，身体微动，表示惊讶。接唱“客来过，年月偏多，刻画尽琅玕千个”，由上场角面向后走至下场门左角，表示是一片竹林。“早则是寒花绕砌，荒草成窠”，由左边用走之字形步法走至右边，表示是羊肠曲径，并向前台口左右两角用手势指出荒草成窠的情状，并用水袖拂衣衫，表示沾带碎草。此时面向前，慢慢回身向左看，猛见一座山石甚是玲珑，虽已倒颓，但仍能引人注意。正在欣赏时发现山石下面有件东西，于是拨开浮土抽出一个画轴，用水袖微拂，并作掩面式，口作轻吹式，头部稍歪，微闭眼，表示尘土飞扬，再用水袖拂拭画轴及身上尘土。打开看见一幅小画，并未仔细观看，所以误认为观音喜相，双手持画，翻转手腕使画面向外，使观众看清楚，在卷画时要掌握两边画轴卷齐，还要使手式美观。
    唱曲牌名“千秋岁”，“小嵯峨，压的旃檀合”，意思是山石下面压着装佛像的合子。但舞台上并不用合子，如用合子在表演上不好处理。唱这句时的身段右手持画，左手斜身用循环指两次，表示山石压着合子。“便做了好相观音俏楼阁”，双手拿着画轴，放在脸部的左侧举起来，表示对观音的崇敬和赞美的意思。在面部的右边也照样作一次，为的使动作有对称美。“片石峰前，片石峰前”用穿袖，一腿独立，另一脚用靴尖挑袍边，双臂伸开微屈，作顺风旗式，表示山石形状。“多则是飞来石三生因果”，意思是有缘在石前拾得这张画，动作用右手水袖护头，眼作远望式，表现想忆古人的故事。“请将去，在炉烟上过”，面向前，前走三步，双手将画上下移动，表示香烟燎绕之意。“头纳地，添灯火”，左手持画，右手用掌放在胸前，身微曲，头部稍低，作礼佛姿式。“照的他，慈悲我”，双手举画过顶，面部喜悦。“俺这里尽情供养，他于意云何？”这时由左至右，仍走之字步，作开门式，表示回到书斋。
    舞台上只有一桌两椅，但在表演和词句里包括花园应有的景物及荒芜景象。舞台上四面八方的图案形，使一人在台上都要顾到，无论舞台有多大，不使某一角落发空，传统叫“照满台”。这一段谈的是“拾画”。　（未完）（附图片）
