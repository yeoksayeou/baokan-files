Can the Textile Industry Increase Production and Practice Economy?
Commentator of this newspaper

Amidst the nationwide clamor for increased production and economy, some comrades in the textile industry system ask: "The year before last was the year of economy (with emphasis on saving raw materials), last year was the year of quality (with emphasis on improving product quality), what exactly is this year?" These comrades raise this question because they believe that after the economy campaign of the year before last, the amount of cotton used per yarn and the amount of yarn used per cloth have been greatly reduced, and after last year's product quality improvement campaign, product quality has also been greatly improved. This year, with insufficient supply of cotton and hemp, and poor quality of raw cotton, increased production is of course impossible, guaranteeing product quality is difficult, and there is no "profit" to be made from economy. In essence, they believe that carrying out the increased production and economy movement in the textile industry has no practical significance. Under the influence of this kind of thinking, some textile enterprises do not have a clear direction, specific goals and methods for the increased production and economy movement, and the enthusiasm of workers and cadres is not high. This situation should be changed quickly.

In the textile industry, what exactly is this year? Simply put, it is a year of practicing comprehensive economy under the conditions of improving and guaranteeing product quality, to achieve increased production and reduced shutdowns. This requirement is not only put forward from the social needs aspect because the textile industry is closely related to people's lives, but also from the current state of waste in textile enterprise production.

Up to now, many people still believe that the economy work of the textile industry is only to reduce the amount of raw materials used per unit product. There is no doubt that this method of economy is very important and necessary. In the past, doing so has achieved great results, and it will continue in the future, especially those factories, groups, and workers with relatively high raw material usage, need to learn from factories, groups, and workers with relatively low raw material usage and product quality that meets standards. However, this is not the only way to save raw materials. We know that different yarns and cloths have different uses, and therefore the grades of raw materials used should also be different. In the past, due to shortcomings in the raw cotton transfer work, many textile factories were "using whatever they had." Regardless of whether it was coarse yarn or fine yarn, they used the same raw cotton; regardless of whether it was colored cloth or white cloth, whether it was used for clothing or lining, whether it was used for flour bags or general industrial packaging, they used the same yarn. As a result, good raw materials were wasted and the burden on consumers was increased. In many spinning mills, yarns of the same specifications are spun using different cotton compositions. Among them, some factories use more good cotton and less lower-grade cotton; some factories use less good cotton and more lower-grade cotton, but the quality of the spun yarn has only very minor differences. The factories that use more good cotton are obviously wasting it. If different grades of raw materials are used according to the different uses of the products, and if products that can use less or no good raw materials are resolutely using less or no good raw materials, then a lot of good raw cotton can be saved every year to spin fine yarn and increase the production of fine cloth, and at the same time, low-grade raw materials can be fully utilized to produce products suitable for specific purposes to meet social needs. The Northwest Textile Administration Bureau arranged production according to the principle of rational use of raw materials, and made full use of the existing nearly 100,000 dan of low-grade raw cotton, and it is estimated that more than 900,000 more bolts of cotton cloth can be produced throughout the year. The East China Textile Administration Bureau changed the specifications of more than a dozen kinds of cotton cloth based on consumer opinions and the principle of rational use of raw cotton, and it can also produce more than 600,000 more bolts of cotton cloth throughout the year. These experiences are very valuable. They prove that through the rational use of raw materials, production can be increased without increasing raw materials.

Fully utilizing waste cotton and substitutes in production and manufacturing new varieties is also a measure worthy of attention. Now, general textile factories are making use of cotton rolls, cotton strips, etc. in production, which is very good. However, the effective fibers of waste cotton and recycled silk in production have not been well utilized. It is estimated that the recycled silk that can be utilized by textile factories across the country this year can spin about 1,700 more pieces of yarn. Recycled silk is also the raw material for cotton felt, undershirts, velvet cloth for children, and other textiles. Shanghai State-owned No. 18 Cotton Mill once used waste cotton and rags to manufacture hundreds of thousands of cotton felts. Jinan Joint State-Private Renfeng Textile Dyeing Factory also used 150 tons of waste cotton and a small amount of good cotton last year to spin 993 pieces of plus ten-count yarn, and used these yarns to weave industrial packaging cloth, which was good and cheap. Tianjin State-owned No. 6 Cotton Mill recently tried spinning a yarn mixed with 15% waste flax fiber, and the cloth woven from this yarn can be dyed into various colors and is also very durable. It is wrong to only see the insufficient supply of cotton and hemp and not see these unutilized materials. In the increased production and economy movement, the textile industry should give play to the creativity of workers and engineering technicians, carry out technical research and experiments, and utilize these available raw material resources as soon as possible.

At present, many textile factories do not pay enough attention to the economy of mechanical and electrical materials other than raw materials. Beijing State-owned No. 2 Cotton Mill recently found in an inspection that there were 16 large baskets of yarn tubes, a total of more than 8,000, lying idle in corners, along walls, drawers, and cabinets in the factory. The maintenance and economy team of the cone winder workshop can use the mechanical and electrical materials and machine parts picked up in their spare time for one quarter, in addition to machine oil. Shenyang Woolen Mill checked out more than 6,600 long-term backlog of mechanical spare parts from the carding, spinning, and weaving workshops, of which more than 6,100 pieces could be used as new, and more than 100 pieces could be used as new after slight repairs. The phenomenon of wasting large quantities of mechanical and electrical materials like these two factories also exists in other factories. The reason is that in the past, there was a shortage of raw materials, so everyone only paid attention to saving raw materials, and the reserve of mechanical and electrical materials was large, and there was no strict management and requisition system, so some workers used them casually and took them casually and threw them away casually. Raw materials account for about 70% of the product cost, and it is right to first pay attention to saving raw materials, but this cannot lead to ignoring the waste of mechanical and electrical materials. Mechanical and electrical materials account for more than 10% of the product cost, and the supply is tight this year, so we should also use mechanical and electrical materials sparingly in accordance with the principle of running enterprises diligently and thriftily. This can not only reduce product costs, but also guarantee normal production and ease the tight supply of mechanical and electrical materials.

This year is a year for the textile industry to practice comprehensive economy under the conditions of improving and guaranteeing product quality. The comprehensive economy mentioned here means that we should not only pay attention to saving raw materials, but also pay attention to saving other mechanical and electrical materials; in saving raw materials, we should not only pay attention to saving the consumption of raw materials per unit product, but also pay attention to rationally using raw cotton, fully utilizing waste materials, substandard materials, and all available substitute raw materials. In this way, we will not be complacent after the consumption of raw materials per unit product is reduced, and we will not be pessimistic and disappointed when the supply of raw materials is insufficient and the quality of raw materials is poor, and feel that there is no way to increase production and no way to save, but like the Northwest and East China Textile Administration Bureaus, put forward many effective measures for increasing production and practicing economy. In this way, the textile industry can appropriately reduce the time of shutdown due to insufficient supply of raw materials through the comprehensive economy movement, and relatively produce more textiles for the country and accumulate more funds for the country.

    纺织工业能否增产节约
    本报评论员
    在全国一片增产节约声中，纺织工业系统有些同志问道：“前年是节约年（以节约原料为重点），去年是质量年（以提高产品质量为重点），今年究竟是什么年？”这些同志所以提出这个问题，是因为他们认为经过前年的节约运动，每件纱的用棉量和每匹布的用纱量，已经大大降低了，经过去年的提高产品质量运动，产品质量也已经大大提高，今年棉、麻供应不足，原棉的质量又不好，增产固然不可能，保证产品质量有困难，节约也没“油水”了。他们实质上是认为在纺织工业中开展增产节约运动没有现实意义。在这种思想影响下，有些纺织企业的增产节约运动就没有明确的方向，没有具体的奋斗目标和办法，工人和干部的劲头不大。这种状况应该迅速改变。
    在纺织工业中，今年究竟是什么年呢？简单说来，就是在提高和保证产品质量的条件下，厉行全面节约，以达到增加产量，减少停工的一年。这个要求，不仅是因为纺织工业跟人民生活关系密切，只从社会需要方面提出来的，同时，也是从纺织企业生产中存在着浪费的现状提出来的。
    到目前为止，不少人仍然认为纺织工业的节约工作，就只是降低单位产品的原料使用量。毫无疑问，这种节约办法是十分重要的和必要的，过去这样做，取得了很大成绩，今后还要继续下去，特别是那些原料使用量比较高的工厂、小组和工人，更加需要向原料使用量比较低，产品质量又合标准的工厂、小组和工人学习。但是，这并不是节约原料的唯一办法。我们知道，不同的纱和布，有着不同的用途，因而所使用的原料品级也应有所不同。过去，因为原棉调运工作有缺点，许多纺织厂是“有啥用啥。”不管纺的是粗纱还是细纱，都用一样的原棉；不管织的是色布还是白布，是做衣服面子用的还是夹里用的，是做面粉袋用的还是一般工业打包用的，都用一样的纱。结果既浪费了好原料，又增加了消费者的负担。在许多纺纱厂里，纺同样规格的纱，使用着不同的配棉成分。其中有的工厂用好棉多一些，用次棉少一些；有的工厂用好棉少一些，用次棉多一些，但纺出来的纱，质量却只有很微小的差别。用好棉多的工厂，显然是浪费了。如果按照不同用途的产品，使用不同品级的原料，凡是可以少用或不用好原料的产品，就坚决少用或不用，那末每年就可以节省出很多好原棉来纺细纱，增加细布的产量，同时还可以充分利用品级低的原料来生产适合于特定用途的产品，满足社会需要。西北纺织管理局根据合理使用原料的原则布置生产，充分利用现有的近十万担低级原棉，估计全年可以增产棉布九十多万匹。华东纺织管理局根据消费者的意见和合理使用原棉的原则，改变十几种棉布的规格，全年也可以增产棉布六十多万匹。这些经验非常宝贵。它们证实了通过合理使用原料，不增原料也可以达到增加产量的目的。
    充分利用生产中的废棉和代用品，制造新品种，也是一个值得重视的措施。现在，一般纺织厂，都将生产中的棉卷、棉条等加以利用，这是很好的。但是，对生产中的下脚棉和回丝有效纤维，却没有很好地利用。据估计，今年全国纺织厂可以利用的回丝，大约可以纺一千七百多件纱。回丝也是棉毡、卫生衫、儿童穿的绒布和其它纺织品的原料。上海国棉十八厂就曾经利用废棉和破布制造了几十万条棉毡。济南公私合营仁丰纺织染厂，去年也利用一百五十吨下脚棉和少量好棉，纺成九百九十三件付十支纱，用这些纱织工业用的打包布，又好又便宜。天津国棉六厂，在最近试纺的一种纱中，掺用了15％的废亚麻纤维，用这种纱织成的布，可以染成各种颜色，也很耐穿。只看到棉花、麻的供应不足，而看不到这些没有被利用的资料是不对的。纺织工业应该在增产节约运动中，发挥工人和工程技术人员的创造性，开展技术研究和试验工作，尽快地把这些可以利用的原料资源利用起来。
    现在，许多纺织厂对原料以外的机物料的节约，都注意不够。北京国棉二厂最近检查发现，在工厂内屋角、墙沿、抽屉、橱柜等处，闲置着的纱管有十六大筐，共八千多只。筒摇车间保养节约队，利用业余时间拣到的机物料和机器零件，除机器油以外，还可以用一个季度。沈阳毛织厂从梳毛、纺毛、机织三个工场里，查出六千六百多件长期被积压的机械备件，其中有六千一百多件拿来就可以使用，一百多件稍为修理后也可以顶新的使用。像这两个工厂浪费大批机物料的现象，在其它工厂里也是有的。原因是过去原料缺乏，大家都只注意节约原料，而机物料的储备量多，又没有严格的管理和领用制度，所以有些工人们随便用随便领，随便领随便丢。原料占产品成本的70％左右，首先注意节约使用原料是对的，但不能因此就忽视机物料的浪费。机物料占产品成本的10％以上，今年供应又紧张，也应该本着勤俭办企业的原则，节约地使用机物料。这不仅可以降低产品成本，也可以保证正常生产，缓和机物料的供应紧张情况。
    今年是纺织工业在提高和保证产品质量的条件下，厉行全面节约的一年。这里所说的全面节约，就是不只要注意节约原料，还要注意节约其它机物料；在节约原料中，不只注意节约单位产品的原料消耗量，还要注意合理地使用原棉，充分地利用废料、次料和一切可以利用的代用原料。这样，才不致于在单位产品原料使用量降低以后就自满起来，才不至于在原料供应不足，原料质量不好的情况下悲观失望，感到增产无路，节约无门，而像西北和华东纺织管理局一样，提出许多增产节约的有效措施来。这样，纺织工业就可以通过全面节约运动，适当地减少因原料供应不足而停工的时间，相对地为国家生产更多的纺织品，为国家积累更多的资金。
