    Many Child Laborers, Low Wages
    The Japanese Ministry of Labor recently announced that there are currently 4,710,000 underage workers (from 14 to 19 years old) and 9,530,000 married female workers in Japan.
    The Japanese Ministry of Labor also said that among Japanese workers, 1,210,000 have monthly wages of only 4,000 yen (360 yen to the US dollar) or less; 2,250,000 workers have monthly wages between 4,000 yen and 5,760 yen.
    Poor Metal Mineral Resources
    According to a survey by the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry, Japan's proven gold mines can be mined for another eight years, copper mines for less than five years, lead and zinc mines for less than nine years, and tin mines for less than two years; while iron mines can be mined for approximately twenty-five more years.
    "Meiji-za" Destroyed by Fire Again
    The Tokyo "Meiji-za" theater was destroyed by fire on the morning of the 2nd.
    This Tokyo theater, the oldest in history, was founded in 1872 and has been destroyed by fire five times in the past eighty-five years. The building destroyed this time was rebuilt in 1950 after the theater was bombed by American aircraft during the war. The four-story theater had 1,744 seats and excellent performance equipment.
    Despite the Prohibition of Prostitution, Brothels Continue to Operate
    Japan's first law prohibiting prostitution, the "Prostitution Prevention Law," came into effect on April 1st.
    However, according to this law, which Japanese public opinion criticizes as being "full of loopholes," Japanese brothels and prostitutes will not truly be completely banned until the end of March next year. Today, the vast majority of Japanese brothels have declared that they are "business as usual." Some brothel owners have announced that their brothels have been converted into bars or hotels, but the actual business is still the same as before.

    日本零讯
    童工多，工资薄
    日本劳动省最近宣布，日本现在共有四百七十一万个未成年（从十四岁到十九岁）的工人和九百五十三万个已婚的女工。
    日本劳动省还说，在日本工人中，每月工资只有四千日元（三百六十日元合一美元）或者低于这个数目的工人有一百二十一万人；每月工资在四千日元到五千七百六十日元的工人共有二百二十五万人。
    金属矿藏贫乏
    据日本通商产业省的调查，日本已经探明的金矿还可以开采八年，铜矿不到五年，铅和锌矿不到九年，锡矿不到二年；而铁矿大约还可以开采二十五年。
    “明治座”又毁于大火
    东京“明治座”剧场2日早晨被大火烧毁。
    这座东京历史最悠久的剧场创立于1872年，八十五年来先后被烧毁过五次，这次被烧毁的建筑物是剧场在战时被美国飞机炸毁后又在1950年重建起来的。这座四层楼的剧场有一千七百四十四个座位和良好的演出设备。
    尽管禁止卖淫，妓院照常营业
    日本历史上第一个禁止卖淫的法律——“防止卖春法”从4月1日起开始生效。
    但是，根据这个被日本舆论批评为“漏洞百出”的法律，日本的妓院和妓女要到明年3月底才真正被完全禁止。今天，日本绝大部分的妓院都声明“照常营业”。有些妓院老板宣布，他们的妓院已经改为酒吧或者旅馆，但是实际的营业还和以前一样。
