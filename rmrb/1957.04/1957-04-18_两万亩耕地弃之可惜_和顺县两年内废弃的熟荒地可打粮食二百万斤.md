It is a pity that 20,000 mu of cultivated land is abandoned.
Harmony County's Two-Year Waste of Ripe Fallow Land Could Produce Two Million Jin of Grain
This newspaper reports that the CCP Harmony County Committee recently discovered during an inspection of production plans in various townships and communes that the cultivated land area had decreased by 7,838 mu compared to 1956. Adding the 14,770 mu of land abandoned after the advanced stage of collectivization in 1956, a total of more than 22,600 mu of cultivated land has been abandoned. This land had been cultivated every year before the advanced stage of collectivization.

According to the person in charge of the Harmony County Committee, if these 20,000 mu of land were cultivated, each mu could produce 100 jin of grain (calculated at half the normal yield), the county could increase grain production by 2 million jin. With a total population of 82,000 in the county, each person could increase their grain consumption by an average of more than 24 jin, enough to feed 5,500 people for a year. This land has been idle for one or two years, and if small crops such as oats and buckwheat are planted, they will certainly grow well. The Harmony County Committee believes that the main reasons for the abandonment of this cultivated land are:

	1. Cooperatives have a lot of cultivated land, and some small plots of land are inadvertently omitted during planning.
	2. Cooperatives feel that the benefits of lower-quality land are not significant. It is better to free up labor to process good land or engage in sideline production. Therefore, some sloping or remote land is abandoned.
	3. A small number of cooperatives do not have enough labor and are too busy with cultivation.
	4. Land washed away by rivers last year, which could have been repaired, was not.

Now, the Harmony County Committee is mobilizing all agricultural cooperatives to quickly cultivate all the abandoned land.

    两万亩耕地弃之可惜
    和顺县两年内废弃的熟荒地可打粮食二百万斤
    本报讯　中共和顺县委最近在检查各乡、社的生产计划中，发现土地耕种面积比1956年减少了七千八百三十八亩，加上1956年高级化后丢弃土地一万四千七百七十亩，共废弃耕地二万二千六百多亩土地。这些土地在高级合作化以前是历年耕种的。
    据和顺县委会负责人说，这两万亩土地如果耕种起来，每亩以产粮一百斤计（按一般地少一半算），全县可以增产粮食两百万斤。全县八万二千人口，每人可平均增加粮食二十四斤多，又够五千五百人吃一年。这些土地已经闲了一、二年的时间，如果种上莜麦、荞麦等小作物，一定长得好。和顺县委认为这些耕地被抛弃的主要原因是：
    1、合作社耕地多，在计划时无意中遗漏掉一些小块土地。
    2、合作社感到质量较劣的土地获益不大，不如腾出劳力对良田加工或搞副业生产，因此，把一部分坡地或远地废弃了。
    3、有少部分社劳力不足，耕作忙不过来。
    4、去年被河冲刷了的土地，本来能修没有整修。
    现在，和顺县委正在发动各农业社，迅速把废弃的土地全部耕种起来。
