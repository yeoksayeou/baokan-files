    Life Service Departments in Bulgarian Villages
    At first glance at the picture above, it's hard to guess what's inside that beautiful building. Is it a school or a hospital? Neither. It is a life service department in a Bulgarian village.
    The first floor of the service department has a bakery. With the help of electricity and machinery, it can supply bread for seven thousand people. Next to the bakery are men's and women's bathrooms. Vegetable and fruit drying and processing equipment is also on the first floor. The second floor houses a library and reading room. The reading room is often used for dance parties, and sometimes it becomes a theater or a cinema. In the Bulgarian countryside, these life service departments are not rare, they are almost everywhere. After the establishment of agricultural cooperatives, the construction of cooperative bakeries began. Each member of the cooperative hands over grain to the bakery according to the amount his family needs to eat in a year. Later, with the development of production and the improvement of life, new requirements were put forward. Thus, a life service department similar to a joint enterprise appeared. Its scale varies depending on the size of the village and the amount of funds available. A service department often consists of bakeries, bathrooms, and laundry rooms. It replaces many household chores for rural women, allowing them to rest and enjoy themselves after working in the fields. (Attached picture)

    保加利亚农村的生活服务部
    乍一看到上面这张照片，很难猜到那座漂亮的建筑物里面究竟是什么。是学校呢还是医院？都不是。它是保加利亚一个村庄的生活服务部。
    服务部的第一层有面包房。借助电力和机械，它可以供应七千个人所需的面包。面包房旁边是男女浴室。蔬菜和水果的干燥和加工设备也在第一层。第二层是图书馆和阅览室。阅览室常常用来举行跳舞晚会，有时它又变成了剧场或电影院。在保加利亚的农村里，这种生活服务部并不是稀有的，差不多到处都是。在农业合作社成立后，随即开始了合作面包房的建设。合作社每个成员根据他家里一年需要食用的数量，把谷物交给面包房。之后，随着生产的发展和生活的提高，新的要求又提出来了。于是出现了类似一种联合企业的生活服务部。它的规模因村庄的大小和资金的多寡而不同。一个服务部常是由面包房、浴室和洗衣间等部分组成。它代替农村妇女们做了许多家务工作，使她们在田间劳动以后能够很好地休息和娱乐。（附图片）
