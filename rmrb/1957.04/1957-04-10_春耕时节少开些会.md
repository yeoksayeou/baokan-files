    Hold Fewer Meetings During the Spring Plowing Season
    Since March this year, Jinyun County, Zhejiang Province, has held eight mass meetings. These meetings last seven days for the long ones, and three days for the short ones. Many cadres and farmers travel from the townships to the county to attend meetings, each requiring a day for travel to and from. Some cadres have been attending several meetings in a row, unable to get away, thus severely affecting agricultural production.
    After returning to the agricultural cooperatives, the representatives who attended the meetings have to hold a series of meetings to convey the spirit of the meetings, so many agricultural cooperatives are also rushing to hold meetings every night.
    Currently, it is a time of intense spring plowing production in the countryside. It is hoped that the relevant departments will not concentrate meetings at this time to avoid affecting agricultural production. (Chen Zhengtao)

    春耕时节少开些会
    浙江省缙云县从今年3月到现在，召开的群众会议就有八个。这些会议召开的时间，长的七天，短的三天。许多干部和农民从乡里赶到县里开会，来回花在路上的时间各需一天。有些干部一连参加几个会议不得脱身，因而严重地影响了农业生产。
    参加会议的代表们，回到农业社里，还要召开一系列的传达会议，所以许多农业社天天晚上也在赶着开会。
    目前，农村中正是紧张进行春耕生产的时候，希望有关部门不要把会议集中在这时召开，以免影响农业生产。　（陈正涛）
