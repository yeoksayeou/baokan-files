    "Wailing" in Extinction
    Ma Qianzu

    After reading "The New Crisis of Essays," which stated that essays faced many contradictions, were unable to be resolved, and were about to "die out," I felt at a loss, as if it were really happening. So I remained silent, not wanting to say anything. Anyway, I don't have extra time to wield the pen, let my pen face the fate of extinction.

    But then I read "My View on Essays," which said that essays were still needed, but should have some boundaries; they can be used as a tool for criticism, but should be used less or not at all as a tool for satire; as for focusing only on wit, humor, and interest, that is nothing more than deliberate distortion and exaggeration, which is unacceptable. In this way, regulations are established, and essays seem to be spared from the "crisis of extinction." So I am unwilling to remain silent and have something to say.

    To say that essays are a product of an undemocratic era, and now it is an era of socialist democracy, so the essay that "originally sprouted from the 'Literary Revolution' and even the 'Ideological Revolution'" should lose its reason for existence. This sounds very grand and has a strong "principled" nature. But if revolutionary essays could be produced in an undemocratic era, then in an era of socialist democracy, undemocratic facts may also inevitably arise! I think that's how it is.

    Ideological revolution is not something that is revolutionized today and then "once and for all" tomorrow. After revolutionizing the lives of "slaves" and "compradors," we must also revolutionize the lives of "masters" and "gentlemen"; after revolutionizing the lives of "landlords" and "capital," we must also revolutionize the lives of "selfishness" and "greed." "Ideological revolution" is truly a proponent of continuous revolution. This is stipulated by its own mission.

    From my own perspective, it's not like I revolutionize my bad thoughts today, sleep soundly all night, and then tomorrow I'll have good thoughts in my head. I have a female worker at home who cooks. She comes from a poor peasant background and has excellent class status. But she loves to take my extra food stamps to buy flour and rice, planning to take them home. I said that if there is extra, it should be returned to the public. Saying it once was ineffective, saying it twice was still the same. She and the nanny both eat at my house, but she eats stewed egg soup herself and doesn't share any with others. This caused a fuss. Selfishness comes before the public, and greed makes her forget others. "Good class status" does not necessarily guarantee ideological progress, just as a democratic era does not necessarily guarantee that there will be no undemocratic facts. What is before our eyes are "masterly airs" (bureaucratism) and "gentlemanly tones" (doctrinairism). Should we revolutionize or not?

    Revolutionize, of course, we must. But it should be "moderate" and "peaceful." Criticism is allowed, but satire is not. Satire can also be used, but it must be appropriate and used sparingly. - Isn't that so, now we are solving contradictions among the people! However, disease is the enemy of life. I have life, but I have disease, which is indeed an internal contradiction. A few days ago, my child had the flu and a fever of 38 degrees. I read in the newspaper that it was not good to use too many antibiotics, so I asked a Chinese medicine doctor to prescribe medicine. The medicine was both moderate and peaceful. After taking it, the fever rose to 39 degrees the next day. After taking it again, on the third day, it rose to 40 degrees, and the tonsils were swollen. So I asked a Western doctor, gave streptomycin injections, and also took chloramphenicol. The fever subsided, and the disease was cured. It seems that potent medicines with side effects are also useful for eliminating disease and protecting life. Even some moderate and peaceful Chinese medicines often use spicy things like ginger and scallions as guides. Isn't that adding a little "stimulation" to moderation and peace? Criticism itself is not necessarily satire. Satire is nothing more than the exposure of the truth. Can criticism not expose the truth?

    The problem lies in treating the illness and saving the person, and also prescribing the right medicine for the disease. If it is said which medicines should be prohibited and which medicines can be used, and it is stipulated in advance, then it is difficult to be a doctor.

    I think that articles, whether large or small, do not have their own style. The style is born from the author. Therefore, it is said: style is the person. And just when essays are flourishing and welcomed by readers, some people say that essays should lose their reason for existence, or stipulate how they should be written, which also expresses the author's style. Its purpose is nothing more than to protect a "masterly air" and issue a "gentlemanly tone."

    However, there is social pressure on essay writers, and this pressure often comes from above. I myself often retreat, even reflect, and really feel that I am not good enough, because I still don't have a "bottom line." But that is the extinction of certain authors, not the extinction of essays themselves. Bold essays will inevitably stand up and say, I want to live! And live forever!

### 消亡中的“哀鸣”
马前卒

    消亡中的“哀鸣”
    马前卒
    读了“小品文的新危机”，说是小品文面临了许多矛盾，没法解决，将要“消亡”了。这使我觉得茫然无所措，仿佛真的有了那么一回事。于是我沉默，不想说什么。反正我也没有多余时间拿笔杆，让我的笔杆面临着消亡的运命吧。
    但又读到了“我看小品文”，说小品文要是要的，可是应该有些分寸；可作批评的工具，少作或不作讽刺的工具，至于只重诙谐、幽默和趣味，那不过是故意歪曲和夸大，要不得。这样，法规是订定了，而小品文也仿佛可免于“消亡的危机”了。于是我不甘沉默，而有所欲言了。
    说小品文是不民主时代的产物，现在是社会主义民主的时代，“原是萌芽于‘文学革命’以至‘思想革命’”的小品文就应该失去其存在的理由。这话，听来是很堂皇的，“原则性”很强的。但不民主的时代，居然还能产生革命的小品文，那么，在社会主义民主的时代可也难免产生不民主的事实吧！我看，事情就是这样的。
    思想革命并不是今天革了，明天就“一劳永逸”了。革了“奴才”和“西崽”的命，还得革“老爷”和“君子”的命；革了“地主”和“资本”的命，还得革“自私”与“贪欲”的命。“思想革命”可真是个不断革命论者。这是它本身使命规定的。
    再从我自己来说，并不是今天我革呀革的革去了我的坏思想，晚上睡了一大觉，明天我就满脑子是好思想了。我家有个女工，做饭的，贫农出身，成份好极了。可是她就爱把我那份多余的粮票，去买面、米，准备带回家去。我说，有多应该还公家。说一次无效，说两次依然。她和保姆都在我家吃饭，却自己吃着炖蛋汤，也不分一点给别人。这就闹起来了。自私前面没有公家，贪欲面前忘了别人。“好成份”不一定能保证思想进步，正和民主时代不一定能保证没有不民主的事实。摆在我们眼前的，就有“老爷气”（官僚主义）“君子腔”（教条主义），革乎不革？
    革是要革的。但要“中正”，“和平”，可以批评，不可以讽刺。讽刺用用也可以，但要得当，少用点。——可不是吗，现在是解决人民内部矛盾的事情呀！然而，疾病之于生命，却是敌人。我有生命，但我有疾病，真的也是内部矛盾。前些日子，我孩子患了流行性感冒，发烧三十八度，我看报上说，不好多用抗生素，请了个中医下药。药味既中正又平和。吃了后，第二天发热到三十九度，再吃，第三天，到四十度，而且扁桃腺肿了。于是请西医，打了链霉素针，还吃氯霉素药，烧退，病除。看来，烈性而有副作用的药，对于祛除疾病，保护生命也还有用的。就是有些中正平和的中药，也常用生姜、葱等辣性的东西作引子，那不是中正平和之中还须加点“刺激”吗？批评本身未尝不是讽刺。讽刺也不过是真相的揭露，批评而可不揭露真相吗？
    问题在于治病救人，还得对症下药，如果说，哪些药应予禁止，哪些药才可用，预先规定下来，那是难乎其为医生的了。
    我以为，文章不论是大品或小品，没有本身的风格，风格之所由生，在于作者。故曰：风格是人。而正当小品文兴盛，并且为读者所欢迎的时候，竟有人说小品文应该失去其存在的理由，或规定应该怎样怎样才可写，那正也表现了作者的风格。其目的无非是保护一个“老爷气”，发一通“君子腔”罢了。
    然而，对小品文作者的社会压力是有的，而且这种压力往往是自某些上面下来的。我自己也常常退却，以至反省，真的觉得自己不行，因为自己究竟还没有“底”。但那是某些作者的消亡，而不是小品文本身的消亡。大胆的小品文，必然会站出来，说道，我要活！而且永远活下去！
