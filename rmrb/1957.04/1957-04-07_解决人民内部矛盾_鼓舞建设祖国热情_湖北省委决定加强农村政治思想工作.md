Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 6th. The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently held a joint conference of county party secretaries, focusing on discussing the issue of strengthening the Party's political and ideological work in rural areas.

The conference, based on the situation of rural work in Hubei Province, proposed a preliminary plan to consolidate agricultural cooperatives politically, organizationally, and ideologically within three years. The plan requires striving for a greater harvest this year and ensuring that within three years, the total income of 80% to 90% of cooperatives increases by more than 50% compared to 1955. In addition to accumulating sufficient production expenses within the cooperatives, the net income of cooperative members should increase by more than 30%. Within seven years, efforts should be made to increase the income of 80% to 90% of cooperatives by more than double, requiring that the lives of cooperative members and the public accumulation within the cooperatives reach a level of abundance and surplus.

In order to realize this plan, the conference put forward some effective measures, the most important of which is to improve the leadership methods of party organizations at all levels and strengthen the political and ideological work of agricultural cooperatives. The conference believes that this is the most central link in rural leadership work in the future.

The conference believes that in the past year, the Party's political and ideological work in Hubei Province has achieved great results. It has not only ensured the smooth completion of the task of socialist transformation of agriculture but also strived for a great bumper harvest in agricultural production throughout the province in the first year after cooperativization. This is the basic aspect. On the other hand, due to the subjective and bureaucratic work styles of leaders and cadres at all levels, a lack of clear understanding of the new situation that has emerged after rural cooperativization, and an underestimation of the basic requirements of the broad masses of people for developing production and improving their lives, many problems still exist within the rural people, between the state, the cooperative, and the individual, and between the leaders and the led. These problems show that the Party's political and ideological work lags behind the needs of the development of the situation.

The county party secretaries earnestly discussed how to strengthen the Party's political and ideological work. They cited many vivid facts to illustrate that in order to timely and effectively resolve the contradictions among the people and inspire the people's enthusiasm for building socialism, it is necessary to resolutely overcome the bureaucratic work style of leaders at all levels. For example, Hubei Province changed to planting japonica rice last year. Local areas had no experience with this new variety in the past, and the leading organs blindly promoted it on a large scale, resulting in reduced production in some areas that planted early and mid-season japonica rice, causing dissatisfaction among the peasant masses. In terms of running cooperatives, some cadres once one-sidedly believed that "all work is easy to handle, and there is no need to do hard and in-depth political and ideological work in the future," "Cooperatives are paid according to labor, so there is no need to worry about you (referring to the masses) not being active in labor." The essence of these ideological understandings is to abolish the Party's political and ideological work, which also fueled the bureaucratic work style of some leading organs and cadres who were high above the masses and detached from them. Due to the relaxation of political and ideological work, some deviations occurred in some places, causing dissatisfaction among the masses.

The conference launched criticism and self-criticism on the facts raised by various places and believed that in order to further mobilize the enthusiasm of the people for building socialism, it is necessary to resolutely support and lead the people in their struggle against bureaucracy on the basis of fully promoting democracy, and to actively and timely solve problems, rather than allowing problems to pile up.

Regarding the political and ideological work of peasants, the conference believed that the focus is on educating peasants with the idea of collectivism. The conference required the Party's township and cooperative branches to earnestly grasp political and ideological work in the future, and to regularly and specifically investigate and study the opinions and requirements of the people in their townships and cooperatives. They should adopt methods such as rooting and linking, visiting, observing, recalling comparisons, and accounting to carry out in-depth and meticulous ideological mobilization work and timely discover and solve problems. In this way, "problems will not pile up," and the relationship between leaders and the masses can be closer, and the enthusiasm of the masses can be higher, so as to ensure greater victories in agricultural production and the consolidation of cooperatives.

This conference was held from March 20th to 31st.

### 解决人民内部矛盾　鼓舞建设祖国热情  湖北省委决定加强农村政治思想工作

    解决人民内部矛盾　鼓舞建设祖国热情
    湖北省委决定加强农村政治思想工作
    新华社武汉6日电　中共湖北省委最近召开县委书记联席会议，着重讨论了加强党在农村的政治思想工作问题。
    这次会议根据湖北省农村工作的情况，提出了在三年内从政治上、组织上和思想上巩固农业合作社的初步方案。这个方案要求今年首先要争取获得更大的丰收，并且在三年内使80％到90％的合作社的总收入比1955年增加50％以上，社内除了积累足够的生产费用外，社员的纯收入要增加30％以上；七年内争取80％到90％的合作社收入增加一倍以上，要求社员生活和社内公共积累都能够达到充足而有余。
    为了实现这个方案，会议提出了一些有效的措施，其中最重要的就是改进各级党组织的领导方法，加强农业合作社的政治思想工作。会议认为这是今后农村领导工作中最中心的环节。
    会议认为，一年来，湖北省党的政治思想工作取得了很大的成绩。它不仅保证了农业社会主义改造任务的顺利完成，并在合作化后的第一年，争取了全省农业生产的大丰收。这是基本的方面。另一方面，由于各级领导和干部存在着主观主义和官僚主义的作风，对于农村合作化后出现的新情况认识不清，对广大群众发展生产、改善生活的基本要求估计不足，因而在农村人民群众内部，在国家、合作社和个人之间，以及在领导和被领导之间还存在着许多问题。这些问题说明了党的政治思想工作落后于形势发展的需要。
    县委书记们认真地讨论了如何加强党的政治思想工作问题。他们列举了许多生动的事实，说明要及时、切实地解决人民内部的矛盾，鼓舞人民建设社会主义的积极性，就必须坚决地克服各级领导的官僚主义作风。例如，湖北省去年改种粳稻，当地过去对这种新品种没有经验，领导机关就盲目地大面积推广开来，以致部分种早、中粳稻的地区减产，引起农民群众的不满。在办合作社方面，有些干部曾片面地认为“一切工作都好办了，今后不需要再做艰苦深入的政治思想工作了”、“合作社里是按劳取酬的，不怕你（指群众）劳动不积极”，这些思想认识的实质，就是要取消党的政治思想工作，也助长了某些领导机关和干部高高在上、脱离群众的官僚主义作风。由于放松了政治思想工作，有的地方就在工作中出了一些偏差，引起了群众的不满。
    会议就各地提出的事实，展开了批评和自我批评，认为要进一步调动人民群众建设社会主义的积极性，必须在充分发扬民主的基础上，坚决地支持和领导人民群众反对官僚主义的斗争，主动、及时地解决问题，而不使问题成堆。
    对于农民的政治思想工作，会议认为，中心是以集体主义的思想教育农民。会议要求党的乡、社支部今后要切实地把政治思想工作抓起来，经常地和具体地调查研究本乡、本社人民群众的意见和要求，采取扎根串连、访问、参观、回忆对比、算账等方式，进行深入细致的思想发动工作，及时地发现和解决问题；这样就不至于使“问题成堆”，而能够使领导和群众的关系更加密切，使群众的积极性更加高涨，这样来保证农业增产和巩固合作社的工作取得更大的胜利。
    这次会议是在3月20日到31日举行的。
