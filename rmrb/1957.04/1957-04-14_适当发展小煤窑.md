Appropriately Develop Small Coal Mines
By Our Newspaper Commentator

    The State Council has issued instructions on developing small coal mines, clearly stipulating the principles for establishing small coal mines, and canceling some past inappropriate restrictions on local and mass coal mining methods. This is a good way to expand coal sources, meet the coal needs of urban and rural areas, and increase people's income.
    With the rapid development of the national economy, not only has the demand for coal by industrial, mining, transportation enterprises, and cities increased unprecedentedly, but also the demand for coal in vast rural areas has increased unprecedentedly. Especially after agricultural cooperativization, farmers have increased the number of livestock, vigorously built water conservancy projects, launched a manure accumulation campaign, and run sideline businesses of burning bricks, tiles, and lime. Many straws that were originally used as fuel have become feed, fertilizer, and industrial raw materials. In addition, the development of mountain closure for afforestation and soil and water conservation work has also relatively reduced the scope for farmers to obtain firewood and grass. As a result, many rural areas have experienced a shortage of fuel. The broad masses of farmers urgently request the state to supply coal to solve this problem. In the past few years, although China's coal industry has made great progress, according to the current production and transportation situation of state-owned and local state-owned coal, the state can only supply the coal needs of industry, transportation, urban residents, and some rural areas; for the vast rural areas, state-owned coal mines will find it difficult to meet their coal needs in a certain period of time. Therefore, in addition to actively developing the production of state-owned and local state-owned coal enterprises and accelerating mine construction, in areas with coal resources, restoring, opening, and establishing some small coal mines according to the needs becomes one of the important methods to solve the contradiction of coal supply falling short of demand.
    Since the second half of last year, after Shanxi, Hunan, Jilin and other provinces opened, restored and established a number of small coal mines, they not only met the needs of local residents for fuel, increased the income of cooperatives, reduced the burden on the state for coal supply, and saved a portion of timber, but also arranged for the surplus labor force after agricultural cooperativization. Therefore, correctly implementing the State Council's instructions on the development of small coal mines will surely be welcomed by the broad masses.
    Small coal mines have a long history and other good objective conditions in our country. Because its coal mining method is simple, the use of funds is limited, and the number of people employed is small, but the coal production is fast, it is very suitable for agricultural cooperatives and handicraft cooperatives to run; and our country has a vast territory, inconvenient transportation, and coal resources are widely distributed, and many places have the conditions to open small coal mines. Before the national liberation, the number of small coal mines produced was very large. However, most of these small coal mines were controlled by landlords, capitalists, and foremen, and the lives of workers were not guaranteed, and national resources were damaged. In the early days of national liberation, due to the restoration of transportation and the rapid growth of the production capacity of state-owned coal enterprises, the supply of coal in the market was still slightly surplus. Therefore, at that time, the state carried out rectification and treatment of local coal kilns, and took some temporary measures to protect national resources and improve the labor conditions of local coal mines. This temporary measure was also necessary. However, even at that time, due to insufficient estimation of the role of small coal mines in meeting civilian fuel needs, and insufficient estimation of increasing people's income, some regulations were too restrictive, too many were closed, and the requirements were too high, so that some small coal mines that should not or should not be closed temporarily were also closed. These are all inappropriate. Now, in the case of surplus rural labor and the demand for opening small coal mines, in the case of coal supply falling short of demand, in areas with coal resources, it is very necessary to appropriately open, restore, and establish small coal mines according to needs.
    The State Council's instructions stipulate that the establishment of small coal mines should be based on the principle of self-production and self-sale, and be mined locally by county (city) people's committees, agricultural cooperatives, or handicraft cooperatives to solve local civilian and industrial coal use. However, when building small coal mines in mining areas with abundant coal resources and development prospects, the provincial (municipal) (regional) people's committee must, together with the regional administration under the Ministry of Coal Industry, make plans and properly arrange them in order to combine them with long-term development. Existing small coal mines in state-owned and local state-owned mining areas that are in production should also be planned, delimited for mining, and if it does have a great impact on the development of state-owned or local state-owned coal mines, limited mining should be adopted, and should not be easily closed. Therefore, in areas with coal resources, the Party and the People's Committee should actively lead the masses to rely on the masses to run small coal mines well. At present, some comrades do not allow the opening of small coal mines even in areas where there are conditions for opening them. This must be corrected. But on the other hand, we should also oppose only running small coal mines regardless of agricultural production. For example, some agricultural production cooperative cadres have relaxed or even abandoned the leadership of agricultural production, only managing coal production. They disregard the transportation and sales situation and blindly increase production, resulting in backlog, excessive occupation of funds, and increased the burden on the masses of farmers; in some places, they only care about immediate interests and ignore long-term interests and overall interests, and recklessly dig and develop coal resources, etc. These abnormal phenomena should be corrected and prevented.
    When mining small coal mines, pay attention to improving mining methods and pay attention to safety. Pay attention to preventing the phenomenon of only mining good coal and lump coal, but not mining inferior coal and pulverized coal, resulting in spontaneous combustion of coal. When small coal mines stop production during the busy farming season, the wellhead must be closed to avoid accidents; small coal mines should also pay attention to ventilation and have basic safety equipment.
    In order to open small coal mines under leadership, people's committees at all levels, especially the special commissioner's office and county people's committees, should plan according to local resources, needs, and coal supply. For example, where can it be opened? How many should be opened? Who will run it? Who will be recruited to participate? etc., all should be arranged in a comprehensive manner. Especially when dealing with the relationship between villages, between societies, and between members, we should especially strengthen the education of unity and mutual assistance, and make proper arrangements to avoid creating confusion. Each small coal mine should implement democratic management. The industrial departments of the people's committees at all levels should also provide technical guidance to small coal mines, regularly organize inspections and exchange work experience, and correct deviations in a timely manner, so that the production of small coal mines can develop healthily.
    Finally, it should be pointed out that the current production of small coal mines is very important, but the production of small coal mines is limited after all. In places where there are no conditions for mining, the fuel problem should still be solved by agriculture. Therefore, in these places, in addition to the state's active solution of coal supply, farmers should be actively organized to develop firewood and grass sources. No matter what region, fuel should be saved vigorously.

    适当发展小煤窑
    本报评论员
    国务院发出了关于发展小煤窑的指示，明确规定了开办小煤窑的原则，取消过去某些不适当的限制地方和群众采煤的办法，这是扩大煤炭来源，满足城乡用煤的需要，增加人民收入的一个好办法。
    随着国民经济的迅速发展，不仅工矿交通企业和城市需煤量空前增加，而且广大农村需煤量也空前增加了。尤其是农业合作化以后，农民们增加了大批牲畜，大力兴修水利，开展了积肥运动，举办了烧砖瓦石灰的副业，许多原来当作燃料的秸秆，变成了饲料、肥料和工业原料；加以封山育林和水土保持工作的开展，也使农民取得柴草的范围相对缩小。于是许多农村出现了燃料缺乏的现象。广大农民群众迫切要求国家供应煤炭来解决这一问题。几年来，我国煤炭工业虽然有了很大的发展，可是，按照目前国营和地方国营煤炭生产和运输的情况来看，国家还只能供应工业、交通运输业、城市居民和部分农村对煤炭的需要；对于广大农村，国营煤矿在一定时期内，还很难满足他们对煤炭的需要。因此，除了积极发展国营和地方国营煤炭企业的生产和加快矿井建设之外，在有煤炭资源的地区，根据需要情况，恢复、开放和开办一些小煤窑，就成为解决煤炭供不应求这个矛盾的重要方法之一了。
    去年下半年以来，山西、湖南、吉林等省开放、恢复和开办了一部分小煤窑之后，不仅满足了当地居民对燃料的需要，增加了合作社的收入，减轻了国家对煤炭供应的负担，节约了一部分木材，还使得农业合作化以后所长余的部分劳动力得到了安排。因此，正确执行国务院关于发展小煤窑的指示，一定会受到广大群众的欢迎。
    小煤窑在我国有着悠久的历史和其他良好的客观条件。因为它的采煤方法简单，使用资金有限，用人也不多，出煤却很快，很适合农业合作社和手工业合作社开办；而我国幅员辽阔，交通不便，煤炭资源分布很广，许多地方都有开办小煤窑的条件。全国解放以前小煤窑生产的数量很大。但是，这些小煤窑大部分为地主资本家和把头所掌握，工人生命既无保障，国家资源又受到破坏。在全国解放初期，由于交通恢复，国营煤炭企业的生产能力增长较快，市场上的煤炭供应量还略有富余。所以，当时国家对土采煤窑进行整顿和处理，采取一些临时措施保护国家资源和改善地方煤矿的劳动条件，这种临时措施也是必要的。但是，即使在当时，由于对小煤窑在满足民用燃料方面的作用估计不足，对增加人民收入估计不足，以致若干规定限制过严、封闭过多、要求过高，以致有一部分不应该或暂时不应该封闭的小煤窑，也被封闭了。这都是不妥当的。现在，在农民劳动力多余要求开放小煤窑的情况下，在煤炭供不应求的情况下，在有煤炭资源的地区，根据需要，适当地开放、恢复和开办小煤窑，又成为十分必要的了。
    国务院的指示中规定，开办小煤窑，应该根据自产自销的原则，由县（市）人民委员会，农业合作社或手工业合作社就地开采，以解决当地民用和工业用煤。但在煤炭资源丰富有发展前途的矿区内建设小煤窑时，省（市）（区）人民委员会必须会同煤炭工业部所属的地区管理局作出规划、妥善安排，以便和长远发展相结合。对现有国营和地方国营矿区内正在生产的小煤窑，亦应该加以规划，划定范围进行开采，如确实对国营或地方国营煤矿的发展影响较大的，应该采取有限制地开采，不得轻易封闭。所以，在有煤炭资源的地区，党和人民委员会应该积极地领导群众依靠群众把小煤窑办好。目前，有的同志对于有条件开办小煤窑的地区，也不让开办。这必须加以纠正。但另一方面，也应反对只管开办小煤窑而不顾农业生产，如有的农业生产合作社干部，放松了甚至放弃了农业生产的领导，只管煤炭生产，他们不顾交通和销售的情况，盲目增加产量，以致造成积压，过多地占用资金，增加了农民群众的负担；有的地方，只顾眼前利益，忽视长远利益和整体利益，对煤矿资源乱挖乱开，等等。这些不正常的现象都应该纠正和防止。
    在开采小煤窑的时候，要注意改进开采方法，注重安全。注意防止只采好煤、块煤，不采劣煤、末煤，结果引起煤炭自燃的现象。小煤窑在农忙季节停止生产的时候，必须封闭井口，以免造成事故；小煤窑也应注意通风，要有起码的安全设备。
    为了有领导地开办小煤窑，各级人民委员会，特别是专署和县人民委员会，应该根据本地资源、需要和煤炭供应情况，加以规划。例如，什么地方可以开办？开办多少？由谁来办？吸收那些人参加？等等，都应该作通盘安排。特别是在处理乡与乡之间、社与社之间以及社员与社员之间关系的时候，应该特别加强团结互助的教育，并且进行妥善安排，避免造成混乱。每个小煤窑都应该实行民主管理。各级人民委员会的工业主管部门还应该在技术上给小煤窑以指导，经常组织检查和交流工作经验，及时纠正偏向，使小煤窑的生产得到健康发展。
    最后，应该指出，目前小煤窑生产是十分重要的，但小煤窑生产毕竟是有一定限度的，在没有条件开采的地方，燃料问题仍应靠农业来解决。所以，在这些地方除了国家积极解决煤炭供应之外，应该积极组织农民开辟柴源草源。无论任何地区，都应该大力节约燃料。
