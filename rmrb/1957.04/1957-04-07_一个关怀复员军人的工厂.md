The 110 demobilized soldiers who were assigned to the Jinan Municipal Meat联合加工厂(Lianhe Jiagongchang) (Joint Processing Factory) have received the warm care and consideration of the factory's leading cadres and workers.

When this group of demobilized soldiers first arrived here in the second half of last year, the factory was still under construction. Among them, 55 demobilized soldiers were sent to brother factories in Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places to learn skills, while those who stayed behind did management, security, and administrative work. They were spread throughout every section, office, and workshop, and were used as backbone forces.

During their learning period, the newly arrived demobilized soldiers were all paid a salary of 24 yuan, which was later reasonably adjusted according to instructions from higher authorities. After the adjustment, the salary was generally no lower than their original rank in the army. Liu Hanchi, a demobilized soldier who was originally a deputy platoon leader, was now rated as a Grade 7 industrial worker. He himself felt that he was unfamiliar with the work and had low abilities, and asked to be lowered one grade. However, the masses believed that he should receive appropriate care and that his actual working ability was not low, and that he should be rated as Grade 7. This satisfied both the demobilized soldiers and the old workers, and they were very united.

This factory is very concerned about the living problems of demobilized soldiers. When Zheng Guangyu did not have cotton-padded clothes last winter, the administration promptly provided a subsidy. When Zhao Shouguang was hospitalized with appendicitis, the chairman of the trade union and the head of the personnel section visited him, and after he was discharged from the hospital, they gave him a lot of care in his work and life. Zhang Jinbiao, the deputy director of this factory, also transferred from the army. He often encouraged everyone to maintain the glorious tradition of revolutionary soldiers at the monthly demobilized soldiers' forums, and often went to sections, construction sites, and dormitories to understand the situation and visit. Gao Yangxian, the head of the factory's finance section, also signed a contract to teach and learn with the demobilized soldiers, helping them become familiar with the business, and the demobilized soldiers were very grateful to him.

### 一个关怀复员军人的工厂

    一个关怀复员军人的工厂
    被安置在济南市肉类联合加工厂的一百一十名复员军人，得到这个工厂的领导干部和职工们的亲切关怀和照顾。
    这批复员军人在去年下半年刚来这里时，工厂还处在施工阶段。其中有五十五名复员军人被送到上海、天津、青岛等地的兄弟厂去学习技术，留下的做管理、警卫和行政等工作。他们遍及每一个科、室和车间，被当做骨干力量使用。
    新来到这个工厂的复员军人在学习期间，一律发给工资二十四元，后来根据上级指示作了合理调整。调整后一般不低于原在部队的级别。复员军人刘汉池原是副排级，现在被评为工业级七级，他自己认为工作生疏，能力低，要求降低一级。但群众认为他应当受到适当照顾，而且实际工作能力也不低，应评为七级。这样，使复员军人和老工人都很满意，团结得很好。
    这个工厂对复员军人的生活问题非常关心。郑广玉在去冬没有棉衣，行政上就及时给予补助。赵寿光患阑尾炎住院期间，工会主席、人事科长都去慰问，出院后在工作上和生活上又给予许多照顾。这个工厂的副厂长张金彪也是从部队转业来的，他曾在每月举行的复员军人座谈会上勉励大家要保持革命军人的光荣传统，还时常到科室、工地和宿舍里去了解情况和访问。厂里的财务科长高养贤还和复员军人订了包教保学合同，帮助复员军人熟悉业务，复员军人对他都很感激。
