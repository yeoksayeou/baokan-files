　　“Borrowing” and “Buying on Credit”
　　If leading cadres have privileged thinking, they will take the lead in undermining systems and violating discipline, causing even greater losses to the country.
　　Why could many cadres in Linqing County "borrow" the cooperative's shares and "buy on credit" goods without repaying, and why did this become a common practice? The reason lies in the fact that some responsible cadres in the area did so first. This trend is very bad, the country's property has suffered undue losses as a result, and the thinking of cadres will also be corroded.
　　However, it is not difficult to reverse this trend, as long as these responsible cadres can overcome their privileged thinking and take the lead in correcting their mistakes, the problem will be easily solved. This means "the one who tied the bell must untie it."

    “借用”和“赊欠”
    负责干部有了特权思想，就会带头破坏制度，违反纪律，给国家造成更大的损失。
    为什么临清县许多干部可以有借无还的“借用”供销社的股金和“赊欠”物品，并且形成为一种风气呢？原因就在于当地有些负责干部首先这样做了。这种风气很不好，国家的财产因此受到了不应有的损失，干部的思想也将会受到腐蚀。
    但是，要扭转这种风气并不难，只要这些负责干部能够克服特权思想，带头改正错误，问题就好解决了。这就是说“解铃还要系铃人”。
