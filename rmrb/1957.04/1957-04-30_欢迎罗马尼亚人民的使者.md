    In this season of blossoming friendship, yesterday, our capital's people, with joyous and excited hearts, welcomed friendly envoys from Bucharest once again. The delegation of the Romanian Grand National Assembly and the Bucharest City People's Council, invited to visit our country, has arrived in Beijing, led by Comrade Pavelescu, Chairman of the Grand National Assembly. This delegation has broad representation, including representatives from all sectors of Romanian society, including party workers, political activists, writers, workers, farmers, and religious figures. They will visit various parts of our country and have extensive contact with people from all walks of life in our country. This friendly visit and cordial meeting will undoubtedly further deepen the mutual understanding between the Chinese and Romanian peoples and enhance the fraternal feelings between them.
    The Chinese people have always been concerned about the lives and struggles of the Romanian people and are overjoyed by their every achievement. In the decade or so since liberation, Romania has undergone fundamental changes. Under the leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party, the Romanian people have built their motherland into a country with advanced socialist industry, greatly changing the economic backwardness left over from the old era. In 1956, the nation's total industrial output was three times that of 1938. Significant achievements have also been made in the collectivization and mechanization of agriculture. Based on economic development, the cultural and living standards of the Romanian people are gradually improving. The reason why Romania has been able to achieve these great achievements in socialist construction is inseparable from the political unity of the Romanian people. The results of the Romanian National Assembly elections in February this year are a vivid manifestation of the unbreakable unity of the Romanian people and their love for socialism. With the development of the domestic economy and the consolidation of politics, Romania's international status is also constantly improving. Romania is playing an increasingly prominent role in international affairs. The Romanian Party and government, as well as the Romanian people, have made unremitting efforts to strengthen the unity of socialist countries and have made significant contributions.
    China and Romania are fraternal countries within the socialist camp. The relationship between our two countries is based on the solid foundation of Leninism's principles of national equality and proletarian internationalism. Therefore, this relationship is unbreakable. In recent years, the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries in economic, political, cultural, and other fields have developed smoothly. In terms of economic cooperation, we sincerely thank Romania for the fraternal assistance it has given us. Romania's supply of power generation equipment, tractors, oil drilling equipment, and petroleum products to our country helps the progress of our socialist construction cause. At the same time, our country also supplies Romania with various industrial raw materials and daily necessities. Our people warmly support the Romanian people's peaceful labor in building socialism and are happy to be able to provide their own strength in this regard. Mutual visits by various delegations and people from all walks of life between China and Romania have also played a very beneficial role in the exchange of socialist construction experience and the strengthening of fraternal cooperation. The recent visit of the delegation of our National People's Congress to Romania was a new proof of the deep friendship between the Chinese and Romanian peoples. During the delegation's visit to Romania, it was warmly welcomed and cordially received by people everywhere. Now, the comrades of the Romanian Grand National Assembly and the Bucharest City People's Council delegation have come to visit us and will spend this year's "May Day" International Labor Day with the working people of our country. We will welcome our distinguished Romanian guests with the same enthusiasm.
    As the distinguished Romanian guests come to visit our country, we wish them good health and wish the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Romanian peoples to be more consolidated and developed.

    欢迎罗马尼亚人民的使者
    在这友谊花朵盛开的季节里，昨天，我们首都的人民，又以愉快而兴奋的心情迎接了来自布加勒斯特的友好使者。应邀前来我国访问的罗马尼亚大国民议会和布加勒斯特市人民会议代表团，已在大国民议会主席帕伏列斯库同志率领下抵达北京。这个代表团具有广泛的代表性，它的成员包括了罗马尼亚社会各阶层的代表人物，其中有党的工作者、政治活动家、作家、工人和农民，以及宗教界人士。他们将在我国各地参观访问，同我国各界人民广泛接触。这种友好的访问和亲切的会见，无疑地将进一步加深中罗两国人民的互相了解，增进彼此之间的兄弟感情。
    中国人民一向关怀着罗马尼亚人民的生活和斗争，并为他们的每一个成就而欢欣鼓舞。罗马尼亚在解放后的十多年来，已经发生了根本的变化。罗马尼亚人民在罗马尼亚工人党的领导下，把自己的祖国建设成了一个拥有先进的社会主义工业的国家，大大改变了旧时代遗留下来的经济落后状态。1956年，全国工业总产量已为1938年的三倍。在农业的合作化和机械化方面，也取得了重大成就。在经济发展的基础上，罗马尼亚人民的文化和生活水平在逐步提高。罗马尼亚在社会主义建设中所以能取得这些巨大成就，是同罗马尼亚人民在政治上的团结一致不可分的。今年2月罗马尼亚国民议会选举的结果，是罗马尼亚全国人民牢不可破的团结和他们热爱社会主义的生动表现。随着国内经济的发展和政治的巩固，罗马尼亚的国际地位也在不断提高。罗马尼亚在国际事务中起着愈来愈显著的作用。罗马尼亚党和政府以及罗马尼亚人民，对加强社会主义各国的团结进行了坚定不移的努力，并作出了重大的贡献。
    中罗两国是社会主义阵营内的兄弟国家。我们两国的关系，建立在列宁主义关于民族平等原则和无产阶级国际主义原则的巩固基础上。因此，这种关系是牢不可破的。近几年来，我们两国在经济、政治、文化等各方面的友好合作关系，获得了顺利的发展。在经济合作方面，我们衷心感谢罗马尼亚给予我们的兄弟般的援助。罗马尼亚供应我国的发电设备、拖拉机、石油钻探设备和石油产品等，有助于我国社会主义建设事业的进展。同时，我国也供应罗马尼亚以各种工业原料和生活必需品等。我国人民热诚支持罗马尼亚人民建设社会主义的和平劳动，并以能够在这方面提供自己的一份力量而感到高兴。中罗两国之间各种代表团和各界人士的互相访问，对社会主义建设经验的交流和兄弟合作的加强，也起了十分有益的作用。不久以前我全国人民代表大会代表团对罗马尼亚的访问，是中罗两国人民深厚友谊的新的证明。代表团在罗马尼亚访问期间，受到了各地人民的热烈欢迎和亲切接待。现在，罗马尼亚大国民议会和布加勒斯特市人民会议代表团的同志们来到我们这里作客，并将同我国劳动人民一起度过今年的“五一”国际劳动节，我们将以同样的热情来欢迎我们的罗马尼亚的贵宾们。
    当罗马尼亚贵宾们来到我国访问的时候，我们祝他们身体健康，祝中罗两国人民的兄弟友谊更加巩固和发展。
