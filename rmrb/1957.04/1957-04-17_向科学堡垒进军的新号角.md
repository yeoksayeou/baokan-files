    A New Bugle Call for Advancing Towards the Fortress of Science
    Zhou Peiyuan, Vice President of Peking University
    The scientific undertaking of our motherland is a unified whole. All scientific workers across the country must unite closely and advance towards the world's advanced levels with unified steps!
    Since the Party Central Committee issued the call last spring to catch up with the world's advanced scientific levels within twelve years, a high tide of advancement towards science has been set off throughout the country. At this National Propaganda Work Conference of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee, Chairman Mao again taught us that the Communist Party can not only lead class struggle, but also lead the struggle against nature. He also called on Party members to study science and strengthen the Party's leadership over science. This brilliant instruction not only pointed out a new direction of work for comrades within the Party, but also gave new courage and encouragement to scientific workers across the country.
    Does the scientific development of a country need leadership? Bourgeois scholars say that scientific research should not have leadership; that the organization and planning that embody leadership will hinder the "freedom" of scientific research and stifle the "creativity" of scientists; that scientists can only live in a leisurely environment to have the "inspiration" to discover the laws of nature.
    But the actual situation is not as bourgeois scholars say. Large enterprises of American monopoly capitalists all have large-scale scientific research institutions, concentrating a large number of scientists and technicians to work for them to obtain higher profits. Even in capitalist countries, in order to strengthen the preparation for aggressive wars, the organization and planning of scientific research can enable scientific research to achieve great results in a relatively short period of time. The chain reaction of atomic energy, the rapid development of radar and jet propulsion are all concrete manifestations of the collective power of scientists under strong leadership.
    In the socialist Soviet Union, the Party's leadership and care for scientific undertakings have enabled Soviet science to rapidly surpass capitalist countries in many major aspects. In these few days, the world's largest ten billion electron volt proton synchrotron has begun operation in the Soviet Union. This provides the necessary material conditions for new basic discoveries in nuclear physics in the future. Only under the leadership of the Party can the material conditions needed for large-scale development of scientific undertakings be guaranteed.
    In the rapidly developing scientific undertakings in our country in recent years, the Party's leadership has also played a decisive role. The Party has educated scientific workers across the country to establish a worldview of serving the people through science, united scientists, and brought their enthusiasm into play. The Party pointed out that scientific research must adopt the working principle of linking theory with practice, and constantly taught us to study Marxism-Leninism, and taught us to understand and master materialist dialectics through concrete scientific work. After the establishment of the Central People's Government, the Party established the command post for advancing towards science - the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Under the leadership of the Party and with the help of the governments and peoples of the Soviet Union and other brother countries, scientific workers have trained a large number of young cadres as scientific reserves for conquering the fortress of science. The state has also unprecedentedly invested a large amount of money in basic construction and books and instruments in the past few years, creating excellent working conditions for carrying out the scientific undertaking of the motherland.
    Perhaps some people may think: only scientists can lead the development of scientific undertakings. To think like that is a kind of narrow sectarianism. We do not deny that the development of each science must be realized under the specific guidance of experts in that science and through the hard work of fellow scientific workers. However, the scientific undertaking of the 1950s has become highly specialized. A mathematician cannot be a physicist, chemist, or biologist at the same time. He can guide the scientific research work of a certain discipline, but he can never simultaneously guide the scientific research of several disciplines of different nature. If a scientist can competently lead a scientific research institution or a university, he must take the mass line, and according to the Marxist-Leninist leadership method, humbly learn from the masses, concentrate and implement the wisdom of the masses into his leadership work, so as to do his leadership work well.
    Under the leadership of the Party, although our scientific undertaking has developed rapidly, we must also face up to the shortcomings in our work. Because we are busy with the work of our own units, the scientific research forces of the Academy of Sciences, universities, and industrial departments have more division of labor and less collaboration. In the past few years, the main energy of the Academy of Sciences was to establish research bases at the headquarters of the academy, the industrial departments actively engaged in production, and the universities strived to learn the advanced teaching system and teaching methods of the Soviet Union and carry out teaching reforms. As a result, in the society, the erroneous influence of "division of labor" among the three units of scientific research in the Academy of Sciences, production in factories, and teaching work in universities was inevitably produced. In fact, the Academy of Sciences has also established many research strongholds in universities to assist the teaching work of universities and solve scientific problems for production units; the industrial departments lead production internships for universities and assist in training cadres. And the Ministry of Higher Education proposed the slogan that comprehensive universities are teaching institutions and scientific research institutions at the same time at the National Comprehensive University Conference in 1953 - less than a year after the reorganization of departments; universities also sent scientists to the research institutes of the Academy of Sciences and industrial departments to carry out research work, and actively welcomed the researchers of the Academy of Sciences and industrial departments to participate in its teaching work.
    This National Propaganda Work Conference timely pointed out the shortcomings in our work and guided us to move in the correct direction. Under the kind teachings of Chairman Mao and the Party, we realize that the scientific undertaking of our motherland is a unified whole, and scientific workers across the country must unite closely and advance towards the world's advanced levels with unified steps. In terms of scientific level and organizational leadership, the Academy of Sciences is undoubtedly the command post for advancing towards science. In addition to the directly affiliated troops it commands, there are also two field armies of industrial departments and universities. Through the academic department organization system established in 1955, it has the responsibility and the conditions to command the national scientific army to fight. On the other hand, although the scientific research work of universities is still in the initial stage, because the number of teachers in universities is large and it is the source of young scientific research forces, when it develops to a certain stage, the scientific research work of universities will inevitably account for a larger proportion in the country in terms of weight. Under the unified leadership of the Party, the three scientific armies of the Academy of Sciences, industrial departments, and universities cooperate closely, and will surely be able to conquer various scientific fortresses within twelve years and reach or approach the world's highest peak in the main aspects of several sciences.
    Chairman Mao also taught us at this National Propaganda Work Conference that intellectuals are teachers of the people, and teachers themselves must first be educated. Similarly, scientists who guide scientific research work must also conduct scientific research themselves. The motherland is advancing, science is advancing; scientists must also work hard to educate themselves and actively study their business, so as to walk in the forefront of the times and be able to shoulder the responsibility entrusted to us by the people of the motherland to develop the scientific undertaking of the motherland.

    向科学堡垒进军的新号角
    北京大学副校长　周培源
    祖国的科学事业是一个整体，全国科学工作者必须紧密地团结在一起，用一致的步伐向世界先进水平迈进！
    自去年春天党中央发出在十二年内赶上世界先进科学水平的号召以来，在全国范围内，已掀起了向科学进军的高潮。在这次中共中央宣传部全国宣传工作会议上，毛主席又教导我们：共产党既能领导阶级斗争，也能领导向自然界作斗争。他又号召党员同志学习科学，加强党对科学的领导。这个英明的指示，不仅对党内的同志们指出了工作的新方向，它也给全国的科学工作者新的勇气与鼓舞。
    一个国家的科学发展要不要领导呢？资产阶级的学者说，科学研究不要有领导；体现领导工作的组织性与计划性会妨碍科学研究的“自由”，会窒息科学家的“创造性”；科学家只能生活在优闲的环境里，才能有“灵感”去发现自然界的规律。
    可是实际情况并不像资产阶级学者所说的那样。美国垄断资本家的大企业都有规模庞大的科学研究机构，集中了大批的科学家与技术人员，为他们获得更高的利润而工作。即使在资本主义国家里，为了加强侵略战争的准备，科学研究的组织性与计划性，也能使科学研究在较短的时间内获得巨大的成果。原子能的连锁反应、雷达和喷气推进机的迅速发展，都是在强有力的领导之下发挥了科学家集体力量的具体表现。
    在社会主义的苏联，党对科学事业的领导与关怀，使苏联科学在许多主要方面迅速地超过了资本主义国家。在这几天内世界上最大的一座一百亿电子伏特的质子同步稳相回旋加速器已经开始在苏联运转了。这为今后原子核物理学上新的基本发现，提供了必要的物质条件。也只有在党的领导下，大规模发展科学事业所需要的物质条件，才能获得保证。
    几年来在我国飞跃发展的科学事业中，党的领导也起了决定性的作用。党教育全国的科学工作者确立科学为人民服务的宇宙观，党团结了科学家们，并发挥了他们的积极性。党指出科学研究必须采取理论联系实际的工作方针，并经常教导我们学习马克思列宁主义，教导我们通过具体的科学工作来认识与掌握唯物辩证法。中央人民政府成立以后，党就建立了向科学进军的司令台——中国科学院。在党的领导下与苏联和其它兄弟国家的政府与人民帮助下，科学工作者培养了大批青年干部作为攻克科学堡垒的科学后备军。国家更史无前例地在过去几年内在基本建设与图书仪器上付出大量的投资，为开展祖国的科学事业创造了优越的工作条件。
    也许有人会想：只有科学家才能领导科学事业的发展。真要这样想的话，那是一种狭隘的宗派主义思想。我们并不否认，每门科学的发展必须在该门科学专家的具体指导下经过同行科学工作者的辛勤的劳动才能实现。但是，二十世纪五十年代的科学事业已高度专业化，一位数学家不可能同时是一位物理学家、化学家或生物学家。他可以指导某一学科的科学研究工作，但决不可能同时指导几种性质不同学科的科学研究。如果一位科学家能够胜任愉快地领导好一个科学研究机关或高等学校，他就必须走群众路线，必须根据马克思列宁主义的领导方法，虚心地向群众学习，集中并贯彻群众的智慧到他的领导工作中去，才能把他的领导工作做好。
    在党的领导下，我们的科学事业虽然有迅速的发展，但是我们也必须正视我们工作中的缺点。由于我们忙于本单位的工作，以致科学院、高等学校和产业部门三方面的科学研究力量分工多而协作少。在过去几年内，科学院的主要精力在于建立院本部的研究基地，产业部门则积极从事生产，而高等学校则努力学习苏联的先进教学制度与教学方法，进行教学改革，因而在社会上不免产生了科学研究在科学院，生产在工厂，教学工作在高等学校三单位彼此“分工”的错误影响。事实上，科学院在高等学校中也建立了不少研究据点，协助高等学校的教学工作，并为生产单位解决科学问题；产业部门为高等学校领导生产实习，协助培养干部。而高等教育部在1953年——院系调整后不到一年，在全国综合大学会议上就提出了综合大学是教学机构同时又是科学研究机构的口号；高等学校也派遣科学家到科学院及产业部门的研究所去进行研究工作，并积极欢迎科学院及产业部门的研究人员来学校参加它的教学工作。
    这次全国宣传工作会议及时地指出了我们工作中的缺点，并引导我们向正确的方向前进。在毛主席和党的亲切教导下，我们认识到：祖国的科学事业是一个整体，全国科学工作者必须紧密地团结在一起，用一致的步伐向世界先进水平迈进。按科学水平和组织领导来说，科学院毫无疑问的是向科学进军的司令台。除了它所统率的直属部队外，尚有产业部门与高等学校的两个野战军。通过1955年所成立的学部组织系统，它有责任并有条件指挥全国的科学大军作战。另一方面，高等学校的科学研究工作虽然目前还在开始阶段，但是由于高等学校的教师人数众多而它又是青年科学研究力量的源泉，发展到一定的时期，高等学校的科学研究工作按分量来说，必定会在全国范围内占较大的比重。在党的统一领导下，科学院、产业部门、高等学校的三支科学大军密切配合，一定能在十二年内攻克各种科学堡垒，并在若干门科学的主要方面达到或接近世界的最高峰。
    毛主席在这次全国宣传工作会议上又教导我们说，知识分子是人民的教员，教员自己要先受教育。同样的，指导科学研究工作的科学家自己也必须进行科学研究。祖国在前进，科学在前进；科学家也必须努力教育自己，积极钻研业务，才能走在时代的最前列，才能挑得起祖国人民交给我们发展祖国科学事业的担子。
