    Some Superficial Views on Two Operatic Films
    Tu An
    Zhou Xinfang’s masterpiece "Song Shijie" (Beijing Opera, also known as "The Four Scholars"), and Ma Shizeng and Hong Xiannv's famous play "Searching the Academy" (Cantonese Opera) have recently been brought to the screen.

    Both films prominently portray two ancient old heroes. Song Shijie, a clerk in the criminal division of the Henan Xinyang Daotai yamen who was dismissed from his post, in his old age with white hair, took in a woman he did not know, Yang Suzhen, to appeal her grievances; when he encountered Daotai Gu Du engaging in corruption and bending the law for personal gain and engaging in malfeasance, Song Shijie appealed to Mao Peng, the Henan Eight Prefecture Circuit Intendant, and finally redressed the wrongful imprisonment. Xie Bao in "Searching the Academy" is a teacher at Qiongtai Academy on Hainan Island. Because Cui Lian, a maidservant of the Hainan Garrison General's residence, could not bear the abuse and fled to the academy, seeking help from scholar Zhang Yimin, the Garrison General sent troops to the academy to search for the escaped maid. At this moment of extreme crisis, teacher Xie Bao devised a plan to let Cui Lian escape. Zhou Xinfang plays Song Shijie as an old hand who is worldly-wise and deeply understands the ways of officialdom; Ma Shizeng plays Xie Bao as an old scholar who deeply detests those who are eager to curry favor and hates corrupt officials, maintains his integrity in poverty, and is content with simplicity. But the old hand is not a slippery character; although he is old, his heart is not old, and he specializes in chivalry and fighting injustice; the old scholar is not a pedantic fool; once he clearly distinguishes right from wrong, he can face danger without fear, be calm in the face of adversity, help others in their difficulties, and help them succeed. Moreover, both are so full of wisdom and so full of optimism. Song Shijie comes from the common people but is not a philistine, he has ingenuity but does not fall into vulgarity; Xie Bao is a scholar, not a pedant, he has wisdom but does not fall into being obtuse. These two heroes who act bravely for a just cause and do not shirk their responsibilities have both common virtues and different character traits. Their characters are also complex: Song Shijie, who finally brought down two high-ranking officials with a lawsuit and was sentenced to exile on the frontier, will also utter the lament of his old age; Xie Bao, at the beginning of discovering that the scholar is hiding a maidservant, will also denounce it as promiscuity and indecency. But the former ultimately risked his old life to uphold justice, and the latter ultimately took great risks to save people from disaster. In this way, their images are vivid and lovable.

    Of course, the two films do not merely portray these two characters. "Song Shijie" also describes the different performances of the four scholars (Mao, Tian, Gu, Liu) who passed the imperial examination in the same year after they became officials in the case of Yang Suzhen; describes Yang Suzhen and other characters; the entire play exposes the various complex contradictions between officials and the people, and between officials in feudal society. Another main character in "Searching the Academy" is the maidservant Cui Lian, played by Hong Xiannv. Her tragic fate and her struggle are very worthy of sympathy and praise. In terms of exposing social contradictions and portraying social life, "Song Shijie" appears deeper and broader; while "Searching the Academy" is more like a poem in its simplicity of plot and clarity of color.

    Bringing opera to the screen is not an easy task. As an audience member, I would also like to say a few words as an amateur.

    First, let's talk about the issue of additions and deletions from the original play in the films. A stage performance of an opera can last three to four hours in one evening, while a film generally cannot exceed two hours, so the stage version must be greatly compressed when making an opera film. "Song Shijie" omits the first eleven scenes of the original play, replacing them with several pantomime shots, such as the four scholars swearing an oath at the Twin Pagoda Temple, Yang Suzhen being sold, and Liu Lin writing the complaint, etc., all of which are concise pictures framed in flower borders, which are explained on the screen, and someone behind the scenes recites the story in rhyme, like the "prologue" of the play. This approach shows the director's ingenuity. And as soon as the main play begins, it is the robust image of Song Shijie walking on the streets, thus highlighting Song Shijie. The film also deletes some irrelevant scenes and dispensable dialogues, which also makes the main content more prominent. The wonderful singing in the first court, second court, third court, and other scenes are basically retained. However, some places are inevitably deleted too simply. Some scenes depicting Song Shijie are also deleted, such as Song Shijie playing tricks with the gatekeepers at the Daotai yamen, Song Shijie feigning to give silver to Ding Dan, Song Shijie's soliloquy thinking of joking with Tian Lun's second bailiff, etc., all of which are details that depict the character. Perhaps some people think that these places show Song Shijie's slickness, damage the character, so they can be deleted. But I think these places show Song Shijie's humor and loveliness, full of fun, and enrich the character's spiritual outlook. Besides, the evaluation of a character should be based on the overall trend of his actions! "Searching the Academy" was not as long as "Song Shijie" in the first place, so there are fewer deletions. On the contrary, the film adds a scene at the beginning of Qiongtai Academy releasing students for the Double Ninth Festival. However, instead of adding this beginning, it is better to restore the deleted ending. In the stage performance, there is finally a scene where the Garrison General holds up the Daotai's official document and rides a horse across the stage, and Xie Bao follows leisurely. On the stage, which is limited by a certain space, the audience also sees the expression of Xie Bao's leisurely and self-satisfied mood of clearly losing but secretly winning; then, on the screen, which is not limited by space, the audience is more eager to see the embarrassment of the Garrison General's failure to find anything in the search of the academy, and more eager to hear the laughter from the bottom of teacher Xie Bao's heart at this time. Restoring a little and adding a little at the end (not too much, just three or five concise shots are enough), I think it would be better.

    Secondly, I would like to talk about how film and opera, two arts with different laws, can achieve harmony and unity in opera films. Chinese opera is not as strictly limited by space as drama or Western opera, but it is still not as free as film in this regard; opera uses virtual and hypothetical methods combined with superb stylized performances to break through the limitations of time and space, while film makes full use of the changes in shots to express changes in time and space. Stylized performance determines that opera is mainly in a freehand style, while film is mainly in a realistic style. For the entire audience, the opera performance on stage has a three-dimensional quality, which adapts to the various viewpoints of the audience; the film screen can only be like this: there is only one viewpoint in a time unit, but in the process of updating the time unit, the viewpoint can be constantly changed (including changes in location, angle, and distance). However, for each individual audience member, the theater audience can only watch the entire process of the performance from one viewpoint, while the film audience can continuously change viewpoints without moving a single step. Therefore, film audiences require to constantly see different pictures, and the director also designs montage to meet the audience's requirements. In addition, one is a real play (real actors are acting), and the other is a shadow play, so the audience's emotions and feelings are also different, etc. These are the differences I have thought of. Of course, there are similarities between the two, and they both conform to the universal laws of dramatic art. Otherwise, opera would not be able to be brought to the screen. However, when bringing opera to the screen, due to the failure to properly resolve the contradictions between the two, many problems have also occurred. For example, not understanding that film art rejects virtual performances, the scene of the actor on the screen holding a horsewhip and circling around as if he is crazy was produced; not understanding that film art is mainly in a realistic style, the number of extras on the screen is forcibly not increased at all, so that the million-strong army becomes three or five old, weak, and disabled soldiers, etc.; not understanding that film audiences require constant changes in viewpoint, a dull shot is allowed to "continue to the end," etc. Or, since the film is realistic, add realistic sets, since opera performance is freehand, then retain the actor's virtual performance. As a result, there is obviously a spinning machine, but the actor is spinning air; there are obviously water and mountains, but the actor is waving a horsewhip in the air. This does not resolve the contradictions, but deepens the contradictions. What is gratifying is that some opera films shot in recent years have gradually overcome these shortcomings. "Song Shijie" and "Searching the Academy" have especially achieved commendable results.

    These two films basically retain the original appearance of the stage performance, while also adapting to the requirements of film art. The stage performance of "Song Shijie" was solved with an old table and two chairs for everything, while the film designed all the sets, with specific streets, houses, yamen, city walls, etc. "Searching the Academy" originally had set designs, and the film used and developed the original design. As for Xie Bao's sedan chair, the Garrison General's horse, Song Shijie's drum, etc., all used real things. Does this hinder or weaken the opera performance? Basically no. There are virtual parts in opera performance. There are also non-virtual parts. Virtual drumming is changed to real drumming. If the drumming action loses its graceful posture due to the change from virtual to real performance, then it is of course a pity, but this kind of place is not very common in the whole play after all. The non-virtual parts of the performance can be fully accepted. Here, as long as the set is well designed, there is no irreconcilable contradiction between it and the performance. On the stage, sometimes this contradiction is difficult to overcome, because that "rubber stage" is sometimes big and sometimes small, sometimes inside and sometimes outside, sometimes here and sometimes there, adding a set often eliminates the magical function of the stage, and at the same time limits the actor's magical creation. The film is different, it can call the lens to constantly change, the background also changes with it, and the actor's creation can still be brought into play. When Song Shijie appears, what a strong impression he gives to the audience! The background of that street did not cover up the image of the character. Many wonderful performances of Zhou Xinfang, such as kicking his leg when preparing to beat the drum to appeal his grievances, rolling up his sleeves when appealing his grievances in the second court, the posture when preparing to go to the Circuit Intendant to sue; Ma Shizeng's Xie Bao's elegant steps, vigorous water sleeves; Hong Xiannv's Cui Lian's beautiful movements such as releasing and taking back the kite (of course, more importantly, the character's personality and mental state portrayed through these techniques) were not hindered. As for Zhou Xinfang's sonorous and forceful spoken lines ("Song Shijie" emphasizes spoken lines and less singing), and Hong Xiannv's lingering and affectionate singing, they are completely unaffected, unless there is a problem with the recording technology.

    Of course, the sets in opera films should be different from the sets in general films. Saying that it is realistic is relative to the opera stage. Opera performance is not entirely virtual, but the whole thing is stylized. In order to harmonize with the stylized performance, the sets in opera films must be more freehand than the sets in general films, especially the exterior scenes. The design of streets and yamen entrances in "Song Shijie" and some designs in "Searching the Academy" are very simple, clear, and can be harmonized with the performance. Of course, there are also issues worth mentioning, for example: Cui Lian is beaten until her skin is torn and bleeding, or she runs away in the middle of the night, and the road is rugged, but the clothes on her body are always so new and so bright. This was originally required by the stylized performance on the stage, and it is beautiful. Bringing it to the screen, it cannot be changed. Imagine changing it to ragged clothes, dirty and unbearable, wouldn't that be a great eyesore? But the problem is that the effect must be unified, so all the houses and furniture are spotless, the plaque of "Qiongtai Academy" is freshly painted, all the walls are freshly plastered, and Song Shijie's shop is also just completed... This always makes people feel a little awkward.

    These two films make full use of film techniques. For example, in the scene where Song Shijie steals and copies Tian Lun's secret letter to Gu Du, the director spent a lot of thought: there are close-ups, there are long shots, there are frontal images, there are side images, there are half-length portraits, there are full-length portraits, and Zhou Xinfang's extinguishing the candle, turning around, shaking his beard, writing quickly, shaking his lapel... and other series of superb performances are recorded from various angles. For another example, in the scene where the Garrison General's wife tortures Cui Lian in "Searching the Academy", various different shots are also used to create an atmosphere. For another example, in "Song Shijie", Tian Lun's second bailiff asked Song Shijie for a wine jar and put three hundred taels of bribery silver into the jar. The wine jar on the screen did not move (actually it moved), the scene changed, and it had already arrived at the home of the bribe taker Gu Du. This saves a lot of scenes and explains the plot very clearly. These places cannot be expressed on the stage. Of course, we also have places that are not satisfied: when Cui Lian slams the door of the firewood room, we hope to see the lock outside the door; when Xie Bao says to the Garrison General "add a capable staff," we hope to see the expression on the staff's face... Here, people cannot help but think of the shot of the second bailiff sleeping soundly inserted when Song Shijie copied the secret letter. It makes the audience feel relieved and worried. It is indeed the director's brilliance.

    Is the use of film techniques at most only to avoid hindering the performance? Not necessarily, in individual occasions it can even help the performance. In the second court scene in "Song Shijie", Song Shijie was originally kneeling sideways on the stage. Although the audience did not only see his back, they could not see his face. Zhou Xinfang's performance with his back is famous, but this scene has a large amount of dialogue, and the audience only sees the side, which is not very satisfying after all. But the film is different: the camera shoots from behind Daotai Gu Du, Song Shijie kneels in front of the hall, the camera gradually zooms in on Song Shijie, until it becomes a close-up of Song's half-length; in this way, the expression and work of Song Shijie's full of grief and indignation and fearlessness when questioning, satirizing, and mocking Gu Du are prominently conveyed.

    The beauty of opera is composed of a series of factors, and the gorgeous costumes and props are one of the factors. Therefore, if you shoot a black and white film, you will suffer. These two films are colorful, and this feature of opera is preserved. The film has greatly overcome the technical shortcomings of early color films in our country in terms of color and light. I think the main color of "Song Shijie" is purple, showing a deep and profound tone; the main color of "Searching the Academy" is orange, a scene of brilliant southern scenery; this shows the keynote of the two plays from the color. But at the same time, the color of the film has coordination and change, and the coordination and change of color and light are also rich and varied. In the scene of meeting in the study in "Searching the Academy", there is a shot taken from outside the curtain, the man's clothes are orange, the woman's clothes are light blue, and a red lamp is on the table. The whole picture is covered by strips of bamboo curtains, which is warm and soft and extremely beautiful. Of course, there are also shortcomings: it is said that the setting sun is setting but the sky is still like daylight, and there is a lack of unified light and dark at night (the light in a certain shot is too bright, and the rest are not), etc., but these are secondary.

    I think it is impossible to bring opera to the screen without adapting to the characteristics of film art. It is a way of not wanting the audience. The success of these two films is a strong counter-evidence. But this does not mean that you can completely disregard the characteristics of opera art. If you do that, the audience will also have opinions. And these two films are not so rude. Of course, in order to create opera art films of higher quality, many complex issues remain to be further studied and discussed. These issues do not exist in the film art circles of other countries in the world (they may have other problems). This task is a unique and glorious task for Chinese film artists (including opera actors, etc.). Therefore, we have less to learn from and more difficulties. We must spend more labor and carry out more creation in order to gain something. I hope that Chinese opera films will achieve new and greater development on the basis of existing achievements.

    对两部戏曲影片的一些浅见
    屠岸
    周信芳的杰作“宋士杰”（京剧，又名“四进士”），马师曾、红线女的名剧“搜书院”（粤剧）最近搬上了银幕。
    两部影片突出地刻划了两位古代的老英雄。宋士杰这个被革了职的河南信阳道台官署刑房书吏，到了白发苍苍的暮年，还收留了一名素不相识的女子杨素贞，为她鸣冤告状；遇到道台顾读贪赃枉法，徇私舞弊，宋士杰又上告到河南八府巡按毛朋那里，终于平反了冤狱。“搜书院”中的谢宝是海南岛琼台书院的老师，因为海南镇台府的侍婢翠莲不堪虐待，逃到书院，求救于书生张逸民，以致镇台兵图书院，搜捕逃婢，在此万分危急之际，谢宝老师用计放走了翠莲。周信芳扮的宋士杰是一个老于世故、深谙官场三昧的老江湖；马师曾扮的谢宝则是一个深恶趋炎附势、痛恨恶吏贪官、清贫自守、淡泊自甘的老夫子。但老江湖不是老油子，他人老心不老，专爱行侠仗义，打抱不平；老夫子不是迂夫子，他一旦明辨是非，便能临危不惧，遇事从容，急人之难，成人之美。而且二人都那么富有智慧，那么富有乐观主义精神。宋士杰出身市井而非市侩，有机巧而不流于庸俗；谢宝是学者不是冬烘，有睿智却不流于迂阔。这两位见义勇为、当仁不让的英雄，既有共同的美德，又有不同的性格特征。他们的性格也是复杂的：宋士杰最后因为一状告倒两员封疆大吏，被判发往边外充军，也会发出暮年的哀啼；谢宝在发现书生藏匿丫环之初，也会斥之为淫奔和非礼。但前者终究是拼了老命来坚持正义的，后者毕竟是冒了大险来救人出灾难的。这样，他们的形象才奕奕如生，令人敬爱。
    两部影片当然不仅仅表现了这两个人物。“宋士杰”还描写了四位同年登科的进士（毛、田、顾、刘）做了官以后在杨素贞一案中的不同表现；描写了杨素贞等其他人物；整个戏揭露了封建社会中官民之间、官官之间的各种复杂的矛盾。“搜书院”中另一主要人物是红线女扮的丫环翠莲，她的悲惨命运和她进行的斗争是十分值得同情和讴歌的。在揭露社会矛盾、刻划社会生活方面，“宋士杰”显得更深更广；而“搜书院”在情节的单纯，色彩的鲜明方面，就更像一首诗了。
    把戏曲搬上银幕，不是一件易事。作为一个观众，我也想来说几句外行话。
    先来谈谈影片对于原剧的增损问题。戏曲演出一晚上可以三至四小时，而电影一般不能超过两小时，因此戏曲拍电影就必须将舞台本大大压缩。“宋士杰”把原本前面的十一场戏都略去，代之以几个哑剧镜头，如四进士在双塔寺盟誓，杨素贞被卖，柳林写状等，都是几个镶在花框里的简洁画面，在银幕上交代一过，幕后有人将故事经过用韵语朗诵出来，好像戏的“序幕”那样。这种处理方法，颇见导演的匠心。而正戏一开场，就是宋士杰行走在街衢之上的矍铄形象，这样宋士杰就被突出了。影片还删去了一些与主题无关的过场戏和可有可无的对白，也使主要的东西更加突出了。一公堂、二公堂、三公堂及其他场子的精彩演唱，基本上都被保留了下来。但有些地方未免删得过简了。有些刻划宋士杰的场景也被删了，如宋士杰在道台衙门口跟看堂人耍花招，宋士杰假意赠银给丁旦，宋士杰想到和田伦的二公差开玩笑的独白等等，都是刻划人物性格的细节。也许有人认为这些地方表现了宋士杰的油滑，损害了人物，所以可删。但我觉得这些地方正显出了宋士杰的诙谐可爱，妙趣横生，丰富了人物的精神面貌。何况，评价一个人物还应从他行动的总的倾向上去看才对呢！“搜书院”本来就没有“宋士杰”那么长，所以删节较少。相反的，影片还在开头加了一个琼台书院重阳放学的场面。不过，与其加这个头，不如恢复删去的尾。在舞台演出时，最后有镇台高举道台公文骑马过场，谢宝随后闲步跟上的场面。在受着一定的空间限制的舞台上，观众还看到了谢宝悠然自得、明输暗胜的心情的表现；那么，在不受空间限制的银幕上，观众就更希望看到镇台搜查书院一无所得因而狼狈万状的窘态，更希望听到谢宝老师此时从心底发出的笑声。在结尾处恢复一点，增加一点（不宜过多，只须三、五个简洁的镜头就够了），我想是会更好一些的。
    其次，我想谈谈电影与戏曲这两种有着不同规律的艺术如何在戏曲影片中取得和谐一致的问题。中国戏曲不如话剧或西洋歌剧那样受着严格的空间的限制，但在这方面毕竟还不如电影自由；戏曲是用虚拟和假设的方法结合精湛的程式表演来突破时间和空间的限制的，电影却是充分利用了镜头的变换来表现时间和空间的变换的。程式表演决定了戏曲以写意的风格为主，而电影则以写实的风格为主。对全体观众来说，舞台上的戏曲表演具有立体性，它适应观众的各个视点；电影的画面却只能这样：在一个时间单位内只有一个视点，但在时间单位更新的过程中，视点可以不断更换（包括地点、角度、距离的更换）。然而对于每一个别观众来说，剧场观众只能从一个视点去看演出的全部过程，电影观众却可以寸步不移而连续不断地更换视点。因此，电影观众要求不断看到不同的画面，导演也就进行蒙太奇的设计来满足观众的要求。此外，一个是真戏（真的演员在演），一个是影戏，因此观众的情绪和感应也有所不同，等等。这是我所想到的不同处。二者当然有相同点，它们都符合戏剧艺术的普遍规律。否则，戏曲就无法搬上银幕了。但在把戏曲搬上银幕时，由于没有很好地解决二者的矛盾，也出过不少毛病。例如，不了解电影艺术排斥虚拟的表演，就产生了银幕上的演员拿着马鞭绕圈子像是发疯等等的场面；不了解电影艺术以写实风格为主，就硬不让银幕上的龙套增加一点人数，以致使百万雄师变成了三、五名老弱残兵等等；不了解电影观众要求不断地变换视点，就让一个呆镜头“一韵到底”等等。或者，既然电影是写实的，那就加上写实布景，既然戏曲表演是写意的，那就保留演员的虚拟的表演。于是，明明有纺机，演员却在纺空气；明明有水有山，演员却在空挥马鞭。这没有解决矛盾，反而加深了矛盾。令人高兴的是，近年来拍摄的某些戏曲片，已逐步克服了这些缺点。“宋士杰”和“搜书院”尤其得到了值得称赞的成绩。
    这两部影片基本上保留了舞台演出的原貌，同时又适应了电影艺术的要求。“宋士杰”舞台演出时是一块守旧、一桌两椅解决一切的，而影片中全部设计了布景，有具体的街道、房屋、衙门、城墙等等。“搜书院”原来就有布景设计，影片运用并发展了原设计。至于谢宝坐的轿，镇台骑的马，宋士杰击的鼓，……也都用了真的东西。这样有没有妨碍或削弱戏曲表演呢？基本上没有。戏曲表演中有虚拟的部分。也有非虚拟的部分，虚拟击鼓，改为击真鼓，如果击鼓动作因虚拟改为实演而丧失了优美的身段，那当然是可惜的，但这种地方在全剧中终究不多。而表演的非虚拟部分，却可照单全收。这里，只要景设计得好，它和表演并不存在着不可调和的矛盾。在舞台上，有时这种矛盾是难以克服的，因为那个“橡皮舞台”时大时小，时内时外，一会儿在这儿，一会儿又到了那儿，加了布景，就往往消灭了舞台的这一神奇的功能，同时也就限死了演员的神奇创造。电影却不然，它可以叫镜头不断变换，背景也就跟着变换，演员的创造仍然可以发挥。宋士杰一出现时，给观众的印象多么强烈！那条街的背景并没有掩盖人物的形象。周信芳的不少精彩表演，如准备去击鼓鸣冤时的踢腿，二公堂喊冤时的卷袖，准备到按院大人那里去告状时的身段；马师曾扮的谢宝的潇洒的台步，苍劲的水袖；红线女扮的翠莲的收放风筝等优美动作（当然，更重要的是通过这些技巧而刻划出来的人物性格和人物的精神状态），都没有受到妨碍。至于周信芳的铿锵有劲的白口（“宋士杰”中念白极重，唱工较少），红线女的缠绵悱恻的唱腔，那是完全不受影响的，除非录音技术有问题。
    当然，戏曲影片里的布景应当和一般影片里的布景有所区别。说它是写实的，是和戏曲舞台相对而言。戏曲表演不尽是虚拟的，却整个地是程式的。为了和程式表演相调和，戏曲影片里的布景必须较一般电影中的布景写意一些，特别是外景。“宋士杰”中街道、衙门口等景的设计及“搜书院”的某些设计，都很简洁，明确，能和表演调和。当然也有值得一提的问题，例如：翠莲被拷打得皮开肉绽，血迹斑斑，或半夜出奔，道路崎岖，而她身上的衣服却总是那么崭新，那么鲜艳。这原是舞台上程式表演所要求的，是美的，搬上银幕，是不能改的。试想改成衣衫褴褛，肮脏不堪，那岂不大杀风景？但问题在于必须统一效果，于是所有房屋家具也都一尘不染，“琼台书院”的匾额油漆未干，一切墙壁都粉刷一新，宋士杰的店房也是方才落成的……这总使人感到有些别扭。
    这两部影片是较充分地运用了电影的技巧的。比如宋士杰偷抄田伦致顾读的密信那场戏，导演花了不少心思：有近景，有远景，有正面形象，有侧面形象，有半身像，有全身像，而周信芳的灭烛、翻身、晃须、疾书、抖襟……等一系列精湛表演则从各个角度被纪录了下来。又如“搜书院”中镇台夫人拷打翠莲那场戏，也运用了各种不同的镜头，烘托了气氛。又如“宋士杰”中田伦的二公差向宋士杰讨了一只酒坛，把三百两贿赂银子放进坛去，银幕上酒坛未动（其实动了），场景换过，已到了受贿者顾读的家里。这就省了许多戏，而把情节交代得很清楚。这些地方都是舞台上无法表现的。当然我们也有不够满足的地方：翠莲在柴房猛拉房门时，我们希望一看门外的锁；谢宝对镇台说“加上一个能干的师爷”时，我们希望看一看师爷脸上的表情……这里不由人想起宋士杰抄写密信时插入的二公差酣睡的镜头，它叫观众放心，又叫观众担心，确是导演的高明之处。
    是不是电影技巧的运用至多只能做到不妨碍表演？不一定，在个别场合甚至能有助于表演。“宋士杰”中二公堂一场，舞台演出时宋士杰原是侧跪着的，观众虽然不是只见背影，却也见不到正面。周信芳背上有戏是出名的，但这场戏有大段对白，观众只见侧面，究竟不大满足。而影片却不同了：镜头从道台顾读身后拍出，宋士杰跪在堂前，镜头逐渐摇近宋士杰，直到成为宋的半身特写为止；这样，把宋士杰对顾读责问、讥讽、挖苦时那种满腔悲愤而又毫无畏惧的表情和做工突出地传达出来了。
    戏曲的美是由一系列因素构成的，服装道具的绚丽多采是因素之一。因此，如果拍黑白片，就吃亏了。这两部影片是五彩的，戏曲的这一特色就被保存了下来。影片在色彩和光暗上已大大克服了我国初期彩色片技术上的缺点。我觉得，“宋士杰”的主色是紫，显出沉凝深厚的调子；“搜书院”的主色是橙，一派绚烂的南国风光；这就从色彩上显出了两剧的基调。但同时影片的色彩是有配合有变化的，色与光的配合、变化也是丰富多采的。“搜书院”中书房相见一场，有一帘外摄入的镜头，男衣橙色，女衣淡蓝色，桌上一灯红色，整个画面为一条条的竹帘罩着，温暖而柔和，美极了。当然也有缺点：有说到夕阳西下而天色还像白昼，有在夜晚而光暗不统一（某一镜头光线太亮，其余则非是）等等地方，但这是次要的。
    我想，戏曲搬上银幕而不去适应电影艺术的特点是行不通的，是不要观众的作法。这两部影片的成功正是有力的反证。但这并不是说可以完全不顾戏曲艺术的特点，如果那样，观众同样会有意见的。而这两部影片也没有如此粗暴。当然，为了创造出质量更高的戏曲艺术影片，许多复杂的问题还待进一步研究商讨。这些问题是世界其他各国电影艺术界中所没有的（他们可能有别的问题），这一任务是中国电影艺术家们（包括戏曲演员等）特有的光荣任务。因此我们是借鉴少、困难多，必须花更大的劳动，进行更多的创造，才能有所收获的。希望中国戏曲影片在已有成绩的基础上，得到新的、更大的发展。（附图片）
