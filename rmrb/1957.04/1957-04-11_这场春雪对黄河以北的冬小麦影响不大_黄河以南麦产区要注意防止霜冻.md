This Newspaper Reports: A widespread snowfall occurred on the 9th in the Northeast region and in the vast areas of Hebei, Shanxi, and north-central Shaanxi provinces; rain was widespread south of the Yellow River all the way to the Guangdong coast.

The snowfall was heaviest in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, with snow depths near Hohhot reaching three to four *chi* [~1-1.3 meters]. The amount of snowfall gradually decreased from north to south. In the Zhengzhou area, rain and snow fell for about an hour on the evening of the 9th and mostly melted by the morning of the 10th. According to a report from the Central Meteorological Science Institute on the afternoon of the 10th: the temperature in areas north of the Yellow River generally will no longer decrease. In areas south of the Yellow River and north of the Huai River, temperatures will decrease slightly, with frost in some areas. Temperatures south of the Yangtze River will continue to decrease.

Snowfall now has a great relationship with the growth of winter wheat. For this reason, the Ministry of Agriculture sent a telegram on the 9th to Shandong, Hebei, Anhui, Jiangsu, Henan, Shaanxi and other provinces, requiring these areas to promptly organize the masses based on the possibility of frost occurring, and adopt locally feasible methods such as watering to raise ground temperature and using smoke to prevent frost, to actively prevent frost; in areas where frost has already occurred, inspection should be organized, and field management should be strengthened to protect the growth of wheat.

According to a responsible person from the agricultural department: if the temperature does not decrease further, the winter wheat along the Yellow River and in most areas of North China will not be greatly affected. This is because the spring cold this year has been long, and the wheat has not yet jointed (the time when it grows upward is most susceptible to cold), and its cold resistance has not disappeared. Although most wheat fields north of the Huai River have jointed, they have not yet begun to ear. With this snowfall turning the weather cold, agricultural cooperatives in various regions should strengthen the protection of draught animals to ensure the smooth progress of spring plowing; fruit tree areas also need to organize the masses for protection according to local customs and experience to reduce losses.

### 这场春雪对黄河以北的冬小麦影响不大  黄河以南麦产区要注意防止霜冻

    这场春雪对黄河以北的冬小麦影响不大
    黄河以南麦产区要注意防止霜冻
    本报讯　东北地区和河北、山西、陕西三省中部以北广大地区，9日普遍降雪；黄河以南直到广东沿海，普遍下雨。
    内蒙古自治区降雪最大，呼和浩特附近降雪深三、四尺。降雪量由北往南逐渐减少。郑州地区9日傍晚降雨雪约一小时，10日晨即大部融化。据中央气象科学研究所10日下午的报告：黄河以北地区的气温，一般已不再降低。黄河以南、淮河以北地区气温将少有下降，部分地区且有霜冻。长江以南气温仍要下降。
    现在降雪对冬小麦的生长有很大关系。为此，农业部已在9日用电报通知山东、河北、安徽、江苏、河南、陕西等省，要求以这些区按照可能发生霜冻的情况，及时组织群众，采取浇水提高地面温度、用烟熏防止霜冻等当地可行的办法，积极防止霜冻；已经发生霜冻地区，则应组织检查，努力加强麦田的管理，以保护小麦的生长。
    据农业部门负责人谈：如果气温不再降低，黄河沿岸以及华北大部分地区的冬小麦所受影响不大。因为今年的春寒较长，小麦尚未拔节（拔节上长的时候最怕寒冻），耐寒能力没有消失。淮河以北大部麦田虽已拔节，但尚未孕育。这次降雪天气转寒，各地农业社应当加强耕畜的保护，保证春耕顺利进行；果木地区也需根据当地习惯和经验，组织群众防护，减少损失。
