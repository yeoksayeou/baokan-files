The lights on the mountain never go out, the stars in the sky never fade, and the hearts of young people are forever burning.
　　In the misty shadows, in Jinping,
　　Derricks, work sheds, and power pavilions are erected;
　　Confidence to march towards tomorrow is established!
The lights on the mountain never go out, the stars in the sky never fade, and the hearts of young people are forever burning.
　　On the high hills, on the shores of the East Sea,
　　The sounds of wind drills, chiseling stones, and motors roar,
　　Like tirelessly shouting forever forward!
The lights on the mountain never go out, the stars in the sky never fade, and the hearts of young people are forever burning.
　　In the night, shimmering
　　Are the rushing vehicles, the gleam of pickaxes, and the shadows of people,
　　They weave together a miraculous scene of the human world.

    锦屏磷矿的夜
    吴兆熊山上有不熄的灯光，天上有不灭的星星，青年们有一颗永远炽热的心。雾影里，在锦屏，
  树起了井架、工棚、动力亭；
    树起了走向明天的信心！山上有不熄的灯光，天上有不灭的星星，青年们有一颗永远炽热的心。高岗上，东海滨，
  呼啸着风钻声、凿石响、电机鸣，
    像不倦地高呼永远前进！山上有不熄的灯光，天上有不灭的星星，青年们有一颗永远炽热的心。夜色中，闪耀着
  如飞的车身、镐光、人影，
    它们交织成一幅人间奇景。
