I Still Want to Return to the Countryside
——A Letter from Yang Wenhua, a Third-Year Junior High School Student at Baoding Girls' Middle School, to Her Parents

Dear Mom and Dad,

I received your letter. I disagree with your suggestion that I keep my household registration in the city and prepare to find work here later. Our principal and teachers have talked to us about issues related to further education and employment, which has helped me understand a lot. I have come to realize that the country is training us so that we can participate in labor better in the future. There is no distinction between high and low in labor. Participating in any kind of labor is for the purpose of building our socialist motherland. Therefore, I plan to return home to participate in agricultural production after graduation, and of course, bring my household registration back with me.

Mom and Dad: You don't want me to go back, saying that I won't be able to do anything there. I don't think that's the case. I am in good health and have a certain level of education. There are many jobs I can do when I return home, such as working in the fields, teaching farmers to read, and carrying out rural cultural activities. These are all things I can do.

Mom and Dad: You know that our country's agricultural production is still backward and cannot produce more grain. This requires a group of educated people to go to the countryside to change this backward situation, increase production, achieve bumper harvests every year, increase income, and improve people's lives. Since you also want to live a good life, why don't you want me to go? If you are worried that I will suffer hardship by returning, that is even more wrong. Labor is glorious, and only through labor can we create happiness. I am willing to use my own hands to build our hometown and make the countryside more beautiful and happier. What do you say?

Your daughter,
Yang Wenhua

    我还是要回到农村去
    ——保定女子中学初中三年级学生杨文华给她的父母的信亲爱的爸爸妈妈
    你们的来信收到了。你们让我把户口放在城里，准备以后在城里找工作，我是不同意这种作法的。我们的校长老师给我们讲了关于升学就业的问题，使我懂得了很多道理。我已经认识到祖国培养我们就是为了将来更好地参加劳动，劳动是没有高低贵贱之分的，参加任何劳动都是为了建设社会主义祖国。所以我准备毕业后就回家参加农业生产，当然也把户口带回去。
    爸爸妈妈：你们不愿让我回去，并说回去也干不了什么。我想并不是这样的。我身体很好，并且具有一定的文化水平，回家后我能够干的工作很多。如下地干活，教农民识字，开展农村文化活动，都是我作的工作。
    爸爸妈妈：你们知道，现在我国农业生产还落后，不能增产更多的粮食。这就需要一批有文化的人走向农村，改变这种落后的状况，提高产量，达到年年丰收，增加收入，才能改善人民的生活。既然你们也愿过好日子，那为什么不愿让我去呢？如果说回去怕我吃苦，那就更不对了。劳动是光荣的，只有劳动才能创造幸福。我愿意用自己的双手去建设我们的家乡，把农村建设得更美丽，更幸福。你们说好吗？　女儿　杨文华
