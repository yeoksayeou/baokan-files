    The Central Standing Committee of the September 3rd Society issued a notice on the 25th to its subordinate organizations, requiring them to conscientiously study Chairman Mao's speeches at the Supreme State Conference and the National Propaganda Work Conference.

    The notice requires that through this study, every member should understand the importance and necessity of correctly handling contradictions among the people. In the study, discussions should be combined with the two major policies of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" and "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," so as to understand the practical significance of correctly handling contradictions among the people, enable members to basically grasp the basic methods of correctly handling contradictions among the people, and implement them into practical work and life.
