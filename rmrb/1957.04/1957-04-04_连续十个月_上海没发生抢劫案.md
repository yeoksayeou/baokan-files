Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 3rd: For ten months, only one attempted robbery has occurred in Shanghai. However, according to records from the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau in 1946, there were more than 800 robbery cases in Shanghai that year.

Before liberation, nearly a thousand factories, businesses, and private residences in Shanghai had burglar alarms installed. In the first year after liberation, 427 households still had this equipment. Currently, only 28 retain these devices.

Yang Baoxin, who has been a driver in the Shanghai police agency since 1932, told Xinhua News Agency reporters: Before liberation, robberies occurred every day, and many black patrol cars were not enough to deal with the robbers. Sometimes, even the "Flying Fortresses" (i.e., red patrol cars) mainly used to suppress the people, were equipped with machine guns to assist in catching robbers. Now, most of these "Flying Fortresses" have been converted into trucks for transporting goods.

    连续十个月
    上海没发生抢劫案
    据新华社上海3日电　十个月来，上海市只发生过一件未遂的抢劫案。但是，据1946年上海市警察局的记载，在那一年中，上海市发生的强盗案件就有八百多件。
    解放以前，上海近千家工厂、企业和私人住宅装有防盗警铃，解放头一年，还有四百二十七户装置这种设备。目前保留这种装置的仅有二十八家。
    一个从1932年起就在上海警察机关当司机的杨宝鑫告诉新华社记者说：解放以前，强盗案天天发生，许多黑色的警备车不够应付强盗，有时，连主要用来镇压人民的“飞行堡垒”（即红色警备车）也架起机关枪协助捕盗；现在，这种“飞行堡垒”大部分已经改装为运货车了。
