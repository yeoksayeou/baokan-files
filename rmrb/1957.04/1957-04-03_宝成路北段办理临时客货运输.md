Xinhua News Agency, Baoji, April 2nd. Provisional passenger and freight transport services on the Baoji-Guangyuan section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway began on April 1st. The first mixed passenger train carrying over 700 passengers departed from Baoji Station on April 1st, crossed the Wei River railway bridge heading south, climbed into the Qinling Mountains, and headed towards Chengdu. This train can reach Guangyuan Station in just over twenty-one hours. Passengers who have purchased through tickets will transfer here to the express train to Chengdu, which is already officially in operation, to continue their journey. From April onwards, an average of four and a half pairs of passenger and freight trains will run daily on the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, an increase of two pairs compared to March.

Since the Baoji-Chengdu Railway was fully connected in July last year, it has undertaken some freight transport tasks, transporting more than 600,000 tons of goods in and out of Sichuan and southern Shaanxi by the end of March this year. During the rainy season when the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway was closed and around the Spring Festival, the Baoji-Chengdu Railway also assisted the highway transport departments in transporting more than 200,000 passengers. Currently, because some hidden dangers on the Baoji-Chengdu Railway are still being addressed, and there are temporarily insufficient passenger train carriages, passenger transport still cannot meet all needs. Long-distance buses that originally traveled the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway still retain some vehicles to serve passengers.

### 宝成路北段办理临时客货运输

    宝成路北段办理临时客货运输
    新华社宝鸡2日电　宝成铁路宝鸡至广元段，从1日起办理临时客货运输业务。第一趟混合旅客列车载着七百多名旅客1日开出宝鸡车站，向南驰过渭河铁桥爬坡进入秦岭，朝成都方向驰进。这趟列车在途中行驶二十一个多钟头就可以到达广元车站。买好直通票的旅客，将在这里换乘已经正式营业的广元到成都的快车继续前进。从4月份起，在宝成铁路上每天平均要开行四对半客货列车，行车对数比3月份增加二对。
    宝成铁路在去年7月全线接轨以后，便承担一些货运任务，截止今年3月底，共运输出入四川和陕南的物资六十多万吨。在川陕公路雨季断道和春节前后，宝成铁路还协助公路运输部门输送了二十多万名旅客。现在，由于宝成铁路还有一些属于隐患性的病害正在整治，旅客列车车厢也暂时不足，所以旅客运输目前仍然不能满足全部需要。原来行驶川陕公路的长途汽车，现在还留一部分车辆为旅客服务。
