    The Countryside Welcomes Us
    Jin Ge, Student of Class 5, Grade 3, Beijing Experimental Middle School
    Since the beginning of this semester, I have never been as excited and relaxed as I am today. Because the "People's Daily" published for us the editorial "On the Question of Middle and Primary School Graduates Participating in Agricultural Production." This editorial rigorously and caringly criticizes the undesirable and erroneous thoughts of many of our classmates, resolves the problem that we have been thinking about every day, and specifically points out a bright future for us.
    Before this, I greeted each day with extreme anxiety and sent it off with the same feeling, worrying, "What if I don't pass the high school entrance exam?" Seeing that there are only two more months until graduation, what should I do? I was just anxiously fretting, unable to come up with a good idea. We thought: If we graduate from junior high school and don't pass the high school entrance exam, everything will be in vain. No one will care about us after graduation, and we'll just stay at home. If we want to find a job, where can we find one? Who would want us young girls? Even if we find a job, we wouldn't know how to do it. For classmates whose homes are in the city, it's not easy to participate in agricultural production. If we study on our own at home, even if our parents don't blame us, we ourselves won't feel good about it. I myself often thought: My studies have always been relatively diligent, and my grades are not bad. If I can't continue my studies and participate in work, what a pity!
    After reading the editorial, I realized that my thinking was too naive and my vision too narrow. Continuing to study after graduating from junior high school is one path, but it is not the only path; participating in production is also a path, and this path is a very bright and very great one. Today, like many of my classmates, I have one more beautiful ideal: if I don't pass the high school entrance exam, I will request to go to the frontier to reclaim wasteland, or to go to an agricultural production cooperative, with classmates like Song Weijia, Zhou Xiaoli, and Du Xingzhi. We fully understand that turning beautiful ideals into reality is not very easy. No work is smooth sailing, and this requires us to work hard ourselves, act according to what the Party teaches us, humbly learn from the peasant uncles and aunts, help them improve their culture, and integrate with the peasant masses. We will complete the arduous task of reforming agricultural technology. Really, how could our learning be in vain? Reforming agricultural technology requires a lot of profound knowledge, and we have only learned a little of the most basic common knowledge. We still need to better study book knowledge and closely integrate book knowledge with labor in practical work. Classmates, the Party has pointed out the future for us, production posts are waiting for us, and worker and peasant uncles are welcoming us.
    My parents are very good, and they agree with my ideas. They always tell me to seize the time to consolidate the knowledge I have gained and absorb new knowledge, not only for the sake of entering school, but also to prepare conditions for future work. However, some classmates in our class are still under great family pressure, and some parents say: "If you don't pass the high school entrance exam, you'll make me lose face." How much we hope to quickly solve the backward thinking problems of the adults!
    The Youth League will soon be renamed the "Communist Youth League," and we will be the first group of Communist Youth League members in China. We want to be a Communist Youth League member in name and in fact, a "fool" needed by the people, and a good helper and good child of the Party!

    读了“关于中小学毕业生参加农业生产问题”的社论以后：下定决心，热爱劳动，建设社会主义新农村
    农村在欢迎我们
    北京实验中学初三五班学生  金戈
    这学期开学以来，我还没有像今天这样兴奋、轻松。因为“人民
  日报”为我们发表了“关于中小学毕业生参加农业生产问题”的社论。这篇社论严格而关切地批评了我们很多同学所不应有的错误思想，解决了我们天天都在惦记着的问题，为我们具体地指出了光明的前途。
    在这以前，我怀着紧张万分的心情迎来一天，又送走一天，愁“考不上高中怎么办？”眼看离毕业只两个多月了，怎么办呢？只是干着急，想不出个好主意来。我们想：初中毕业考不上高中，一切都白费了。毕业后也没人管了，自己呆在家里。找工作吧，上哪去找呢？谁会要我们这些毛丫头呢？即是找到了工作，也不会做。家在城市的同学，想去参加农业生产，可不容易啊。如果在家里自学，爸爸妈妈即使不责备，可是自己心里也过不去。我自己也常常想：我的学习一直是比较用功的，成绩也是不坏的。如果不能继续升学，参加工作多可惜啊！
    读了社论以后，发现我的想法太幼稚了，我的眼光太浅小了。初中毕业继续升学是一条路，但不是唯一的一条路；参加生产也是一条路，而这条路是非常光明非常伟大的一条路。今天，我和很多同学一样，多了一个美丽的理想：如果考不上高中，我和宋薇笳、周笑莉、杜杏之等同学请求到边疆去开荒，或者到农业生产合作社去。我们完全明白，美丽的理想要变成现实，不是十分容易的。任何工作都不是一帆风顺的，这需要我们自己去努力，按着党教导我们的去作，虚心向农民伯伯、大娘学习，帮助他们提高文化，和农民群众打成一片。我们要去完成改革农业技术这项艰巨任务。真的，我们怎么会白学呢？改革农业技术需要很多高深的知识，而我们只不过学习了一点最普通的基本知识。我们还需要更好地学习书本知识，在实际工作中把书本知识和劳动紧密结合起来。同学们，党为我们指出了前途，生产岗位在等待着我们，工人、农民叔叔在欢迎我们。
    我的父母非常好，他们同意我的想法。他们总是告诉我，要抓紧时间巩固已得的知识和吸取新的知识，这不只是为了升学，同时也是为了替今后的工作准备条件。但是，我们班上有些同学还受着很大的家庭压力，有的父母说：“考不上高中是给我丢脸。”我们是多么希望快点解决大人们的落后思想问题啊！
    青年团不久将改为“共青团”，我们将是中国的第一批共青团员。我们要作一个名副其实的共青团员，作人民需要的“傻子”，作党的好助手、好孩子！
