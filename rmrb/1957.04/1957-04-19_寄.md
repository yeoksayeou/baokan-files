    Dear teacher, you have come, bringing with you the heart of a Soviet warrior, dragging the foot wounded in the Patriotic War, and marching into the primeval forest with us. You have left behind your warm home, saying that there is the love of six hundred million people here. You are cultivating young Chinese forestry managers, organizing the vast ancient battlefield—the forest. From Changbai Mountain to the Greater Khingan Range, the stirring voices of the martyrs call to us. In this silent sea of forests, there is also the sound of your hurried footsteps. You are a hunter, and also a fisherman, and even more a warrior advancing towards nature. You have taught us the skills of living in the primeval forest. At night, by the blue bonfire, you come to listen to the Anti-Japanese United Army's struggles... Even the stars squeeze into the tent, listening to you talk about the situation of being exiled to Siberia... You came here during the morning of our construction. When you return, you will take with you the love of six hundred million people, the frost and snow of the Greater Khingan Range, and they will melt together with the frost and snow of Siberia.

    宋玳亲爱的老师，你来了，你带着一颗苏维埃战士的心，拖着在卫国战争中负伤的脚，和我们一同向原始林迈进。你抛开了温暖的家，你说这儿有六亿人民的爱情，你培养中国年轻的森林经理工作者，整理广阔无边的古战场——森林。从长白山到兴安岭，先烈激昂的声音召唤着我们，在这静寂的林海里，也有你急促的脚步声。你是一个猎手，也是一个渔人，你更是向大自然进军的战士，你把生活在原始林里的本领教给了我们。晚上，蓝色的篝火边，你来听抗联的斗争……星星也挤进了帐篷，听你讲流放西伯利亚的情形……你来到这里，正是我们建设的早晨，你回去，将带着六亿人的爱情，将带着兴安岭的霜雪，和西伯利亚的霜雪融化在一起。
