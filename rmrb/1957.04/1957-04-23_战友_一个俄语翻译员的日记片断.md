Comrades-in-Arms
—Excerpts from the Diary of a Russian Translator
Chen Jichun
July 3rd Rain

Persistent drizzle. The construction site is a muddy mess, but construction continues feverishly.

As soon as expert Ivakin entered the rain shelter, he jumped down into the foundation pits one by one to inspect the column footings. He was just as strict with Wang Jian by the mixer, raising many points, even seemingly insignificant small problems, very seriously. However, behind the scenes, he often said to the manager: "If there were ten shock brigades led by someone like Wang Jian on the construction site, the factory could be completed a year ahead of schedule."

Today, he suddenly quietly asked me, "Is Wang Jian from a military background?"

I told him that Wang Jian often asked me, "Why is the expert's voice always hoarse?"

July 10th Sunny

All the column footings of the thermal power plant have been demolded, and the quality is excellent. Completed half a month ahead of schedule. On site, expert Ivakin shook Wang Jian's hand and said with a smile: "You don't have to bring your study notebook to my house tonight, let's have a tea party tonight!"

After dinner, the expert and his wife, Maria, received us very warmly.

The expert stood up and raised his glass, saying: "Today, I call this a 'Comrades-in-Arms Reunion!' Come, cheers!"

The expert also said to Wang Jian: "I heard that your eye is a mark of glory, is that right?"

"It's nothing! When I was a 'little devil' in the Anti-Japanese United Army at the age of twelve, I was wounded while delivering documents and killing two Japanese soldiers."

The expert took out a photo, which showed two soldiers wearing Red Army caps. We recognized the one on the left as the young expert Ivakin.

The expert took out a Red Star cap badge and pointed sadly at the Chinese man on the right in the photo, saying, "This is his!"

In an instant, everyone lowered their heads in silence. Only the ticking sound of the wall clock could be heard...

Maria said that he was killed by a bomb in the Western Theater while fighting the German invaders. Expert Ivakin's throat was also injured that time, and the shrapnel still cannot be completely removed.

Expert Ivakin gave the Red Star to Wang Jian and said:

"In 1945, I came with the 'Katyusha' to help the Chinese people liberate the Northeast. I didn't have time to find my second old comrade-in-arms, but today, I finally found him on the construction site: Wang Jian!"

I saw two large hands clasped tightly under the light, for a long time...

August 6th Cloudy

The expert made a few modifications to Wang Jian's suggestion for modifying the vibrating machine cone head and completely agreed.

But Wang Jian was injured and hospitalized yesterday.

It turned out that the cone head of the newly bought cone vibrator was too thick. Before it was modified, it got stuck in the rebar mesh after vibrating twice when inserted into the formwork. Everyone tried to pull it out but couldn't. Wang Jian pulled it, and it came out, but he used too much force and hit the corner of the formwork with his head, making his already blind eye bloody.

After work, the expert went to see Wang Jian immediately.

August 11th Sunny

Today, the expert and Maria went to see Wang Jian again. The nurse quietly asked: "Is this patient your manager? Why do the Soviet experts come to see him every day?" I told the expert this, and the expert said: "Worker! They are all workers! He is a black-eyed worker, and I am a blue-eyed worker!"

December 10th Snow

Goose feather snowflakes are falling one after another.

Large-scale construction in such a cold winter is really the first time for us.

In the warm shed, the concrete pouring work is going on day and night.

The warm shed is very low. Stoves are lit, but the cold air still comes from the top of the shed. The stoves emit a choking gas.

Expert Ivakin and the workers work together for more than ten hours almost every day.

The leadership is very worried about expert Ivakin's sore throat and urges him to rest every day, but he always refuses to leave.

Tonight, Wang Jian (he has been promoted to construction technician after being discharged from the hospital) heard the expert's voice becoming more and more hoarse, so he specially called a doctor to persuade him. After examination, the doctor said that his throat injury had relapsed and he must be hospitalized.

December 11th Sunny

Today, the manager, director, and Wang Jian went to see the expert together.

The expert's throat could no longer make a sound. When he saw everyone, he opened his mouth, trying to speak. He sat up and found paper and pen, and wrote a large sheet, handing it to the manager.

"Shall I pass it on to Maria?" the manager asked. The expert shook his head. I translated it, and everyone was extremely moved. The expert gave us so many valuable suggestions even on his sickbed!

December 12th Sunny

In the morning, the expert reception desk called and said that expert Ivakin had returned to Moscow for treatment during the night...

We didn't have time to see him off, and we felt even more sad!

December 20th (Saturday) Sunny

I had just fallen asleep when a knock on the door startled me.

Wang Jian hurriedly handed me a telegram. I translated it:

"Comrade Wang Jian: Expert Ivakin has undergone surgery, and everything is fine. Before being admitted to the hospital, he and the mechanical engineer of the design institute discussed the problem of replacing the coke furnace heating equipment and asked me to send a telegram to you immediately, with the full text of the suggestions as follows, please forward it to the manager for reference...

Maria × day"

After listening to the telegram, Wang Jian picked me up and almost threw me to the ceiling.

How wonderful, the expert is safe! We will no longer smell the choking gas in the warm shed...

May 10th Sunny

What a coincidence, I met Wang Jian on the train today. We hadn't seen each other for two whole years. When we met, someone called him Engineer!

I suddenly remembered that what expert Ivakin often said had come true. Wang Jian seemed to see through my contemplation and immediately recited the expert's words, and I immediately interjected, "We are not only willing to help with China's construction, but we are also more willing to help Chinese comrades become experts of tomorrow!"

In my excitement, I heard Wang Jian say that expert Ivakin's voice was much clearer. He had gone to Vietnam with a group of Soviet experts. He invited me to meet in Beijing, and before leaving, he hugged me tightly and said, "Let's do it, comrade-in-arms! Whether on the banks of the Don, by the Yangtze River, or in Vietnam; the more chimneys erected on the people's land, the more steel fists and iron arms world peace will have..."

    战友
    ——一个俄语翻译员的日记片断
    陈基春
    7月3日　雨
    霪雨绵绵。工地上一片泥泞，但工程仍然火热地进行着。
    依瓦金专家一钻进雨棚，就挨个地跳下地坑去检查柱基。在搅拌机边，他照样很严格地对王健提出了许多意见，甚至看来不足轻重的小问题，也很认真。然而背地里，他常对经理说：“如果工地上有十个像王健所领导的突击队，工厂可以提前一年交工。”
    今天，他忽然悄悄地问我：“王健是不是战士出身？”
    我告诉他，王健也常问我：“为什么专家的声音总是沙哑？”
    7月10日　晴
    热电站的柱基全部拆模了，质量很好。提前了半个月完成。在现场上，依瓦金专家拉王健的手笑着说：“今天晚上你可不必带学习本到我家来了，今晚我们就开个茶话会吧！”
    晚饭后，专家和他的爱人玛丽亚非常热情地接待了我们。
    专家站起举杯说：“今天，我叫它为‘战友联欢会！’来，干一杯！”
    专家又对王健说：“我听说你的眼睛是一个光荣的记号，是吗？”
    “不算什么！十二岁时在抗日联军里当‘小鬼’，在送文件途中打死两个鬼子时负伤的。”
    专家取出一张照片，上面是两个戴红军帽的战士，我们认出来左边的就是年青时的依瓦金专家。
    专家又拿出一枚红五角星帽徽，指着照片右边的中国人沉痛地说：“这就是他的！”
    一霎时，大家低头无语。只有墙上挂钟的答的答的声音。……
    玛丽亚说他是在西战场打德寇时被炸牺牲的。依瓦金专家的喉咙也是那次受的伤，现在碎弹片还没法取尽。
    依瓦金专家把那颗红五角星送给王健，并说：
    “1945年我带着‘喀秋莎’来帮助中国人民解放东北，还来不及找到第二个老战友，今天，终于在工地上找到了：王健！”
    我看到了灯光下两只大手紧握着，长久地……
    8月6日　阴
    专家把王健改装震动机锥头的建议，作了个别地方的修改就完全同意了。
    但王健昨天已受伤入院。
    原来新买的锥式震动机锥头太粗，还未改装，插进模板时震动两下就被钢筋网卡住了。大家去拉拉不出，王健去拉，拉出来了，可是用力过猛，一头撞在模板角上，把那只已瞎的眼睛撞得血淋淋的。
    下班后，专家马上去看王健。
    8月11日　晴
    今天，专家又和玛丽亚去看王健。护士悄悄地问：“这个病人是你们的经理吗？为什么苏联专家天天都来看他？”我把这话转告专家，专家说：“工人！都是工人！他是黑眼睛的工人，我是蓝眼睛的工人！”
    12月10日　雪
    鹅毛大雪纷纷飘着。
    在这样的寒冬里大规模施工，对我们真是破题儿第一遭。
    暖棚里，混凝土的浇灌工作，日夜不停地进行着。
    暖棚很低，生了炉子，寒气还是从棚顶袭来。炉里发出一股煤气很呛人。
    依瓦金专家和工人们一起，几乎每天都工作十小时以上。
    领导上很耽心依瓦金专家的喉痛，天天劝他注意休息，但他总不肯离开。
    今天晚间，王健（他出院后已升为施工员）听专家的声音愈来愈沙哑了，就特地打电话请医生来劝他。医生检查后说，喉伤复发，一定要住院。
    12月11日　晴
    今天，经理、主任和王健一起去看专家。
    专家的喉咙已经说不出声音。看见大家的时候，空张嘴想说话。他支起身子，找了纸笔，沙沙地写了一大张交给经理。
    “把它转交玛丽亚吧？”经理问。专家摇头。我把它译出，大家都感动极了。专家在病床上还给我们提了这么多宝贵的建议！
    12月12日　晴
    早晨，专家招待处来电话说，依瓦金专家夜间已返莫斯科医治。……
    我们来不及送行，心里更难过！
    12月20日（星期六）晴
    我刚睡下，忽然一阵敲门声把我惊起。
    王健急匆匆地递给我一张电报。我译道：
    “王健同志：依瓦金专家已动手术，一切都好。临入院时，他和设计院机械师研究好了换掉焦炭炉的采暖设备问题，叫我马上拍电报给你，附建议全文如下，请速转经理参考。……
                玛丽亚　×日”
    王健听完电文，把我一把抱起，险些没抛到天花板上去。
    多好啊，专家平安！暖棚里又将闻不到呛人的煤气了……
    5月10日　晴
    真巧，今天在火车上碰见了王健。整整两年不见面了。见面时，那边有人叫他工程师！
    我猛然想起，依瓦金专家常说的那句话真实现了。王健好像看透了我的沉思，一下背起专家那句话，我也立即接口插上，“我们不但愿意帮助中国建设，我们更愿意帮助中国同志都成为明天的专家！”
    我在兴奋中又听王健说，依瓦金专家的嗓子已经清亮多了。他又和一群苏联专家到越南去了。他约我来北京相会，临行他紧紧拥抱我说：“干吧，战友！不管在顿河岸上，扬子江边，或在越南；在人民的土地上多竖起一根烟囱，世界和平就多长了一只钢拳铁臂……”
