    Malaria Control Work in Simao
    In the past, Simao County, Yunnan Province, was one of the areas with the highest incidence of malignant malaria. After liberation, the People's Government immediately established medical institutions for the prevention and treatment of malaria and carried out malaria eradication work, which has been very effective. Recently, the number of people suffering from malaria or having malaria relapses in Simao County has been less than 1% of the total population.

    治疟工作在思茅
    云南省思茅县过去是恶性疟疾发生最厉害的地区，解放后，人民政府立即建立了防治疟疾的医疗机构，进行扑疟工作，很有成效。最近，思茅县城患疟疾的或者疟疾复发的人数不到人口总数的1％。图中是思茅县疟疾防治站人员用六六六粉消灭孑孓情形。　新华社记者
