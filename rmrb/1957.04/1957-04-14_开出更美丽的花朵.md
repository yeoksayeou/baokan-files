Blooming More Beautiful Flowers
Comrade Jin Ge:

    After reading your article "The Countryside Welcomes Us," I was very moved. In our society, only labor can earn the people's rewards and honor, and only labor is a glorious and heroic cause. Everyone should be determined to love labor and participate in the construction of a new socialist countryside. If we do not change the countryside, do not achieve agricultural collectivization and mechanization, and do not vigorously support agricultural construction, then the construction of socialism is also unimaginable. If we want to change the face of the countryside, we must participate in the new socialist rural construction, and reverse the idea that it is "shameful," "hopeless," and "without prospects" in the countryside. In our country, "every profession produces its top talent." As long as you engage in selfless labor for the cause of the Party and the people, you will be respected and honored.
    I love our society, and I love even more the vast land and simple countryside of our motherland. In 1949, I was just a fifteen-year-old kid, and I joined the rural work team after graduating from junior high school. The situation at that time was much more complicated than it is now. During the day, we had to mobilize the masses, and at night, we had to use guns to fight relentlessly against counter-revolutionaries. At first, I was very unaccustomed to it. Life was very hard, and work and study were unstable. Later, under the education of the Party, I not only got used to it, but also had a very happy time. The peasants' simple thoughts and strong fighting beliefs further encouraged my confidence to move forward.
    Now, I am studying at Renmin University and will graduate this year. The first thing I filled out on my graduation application was to participate in rural construction. Like you, I am waiting for the country's assignment. Wherever the motherland needs me, I will happily go. We are all young people, and the road ahead of us is broad. Let our young generation bloom more beautiful flowers in the socialist garden of the motherland.

    开出更美丽的花朵金戈同学：
    当我读完了你的“农村在欢迎我们”这篇文章后，感情很激动。在我们的社会里，只有劳动才能得到人民的奖赏和荣誉，也只有劳动才是光荣的豪迈的事业。大家应该下定决心，热爱劳动，参加建设社会主义的新农村。如果不改变农村，不使农业合作化和机械化，不大力支援农业建设，那末建设社会主义也是不可想像的。我们要改变农村的面貌，就要参加社会主义农村的新建设，要扭转那种认为在农村“丢人”、“没出息”、“没前途”的想法。在我们的国家里，“行行出状元”。只要你为党和人民的事业而进行忘我的劳动，你就会得到尊敬和荣誉。
    我热爱我们的社会，更热爱祖国辽阔的土地和朴质的农村。1949年，我还是十五岁的小鬼，初中刚毕业就参加了农村工作。那时的情况比现在要复杂得多，白天要发动群众，晚上还要拿着枪杆子和反革命分子进行无情的斗争，开始很不习惯，生活很艰苦，工作、学习又不稳定，后来在党的教育下，不仅习惯了，而且过得非常愉快。农民纯朴的思想和坚强的斗争信念，更加鼓舞了我前进的信心。
    现在，我在人民大学学习，今年就要毕业了。在我的毕业志愿书上填的第一个是参加农村建设。我和你们一样在等待着祖国的分配。祖国需要我到什么地方去，我将愉快地走到什么地方去。我们都是青年，摆在我们面前的道路是广阔的。让我们年轻的一代在祖国社会主义花园中，开出更美丽的花朵。
