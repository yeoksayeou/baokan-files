　　Our Moscow, 25th dispatch, reporter Li He reports: "Comrade Voroshilov's visit to China this time has shortened the distance between Beijing and Moscow a lot." This is what Taji Bo'na Sergeevna Tsibalova told reporters. Tsibalova is a teacher at Moscow No. 110 School. She visited our country last year and brought back the close friendship of Chinese teachers and students towards the Soviet Union. Through her, teachers and students of Beijing No. 4 Middle School established close communication with teachers and students of Moscow No. 110 School. She told me that her impression of China was: "The Chinese teachers' ardent desire to seek benefits for the motherland makes us very admire. Chinese teachers are never complacent. They fully understand how huge a task they bear."
　　Tsibalova talked about how correspondence is an important way to enhance friendship between the people of the two countries. She said that now the communication between the whole school, the whole class, and individual students is very beneficial. When she was in China, she established contact with the teachers of Beijing No. 4 Middle School. After returning home, through correspondence, the two schools jointly studied the common problem: "How to cultivate students' habits of independent learning and independent thinking." She said:
　　"This kind of friendship is more precious than anything else. There are many capable teachers in China. If we study common problems together, then our common cause will advance more rapidly."
　　This experienced female teacher keenly saw the impact of communication on students. She said: "It is not enough if students' interests are only limited to school knowledge. Correspondence allows students to make new friends from the great China." She took out a stack of correspondence. Reading these letters, I felt that the young people of China and the Soviet Union are truly connected heart to heart.
　　Here are two excerpts from these letters:
　　The letter from all the students of the tenth grade, class B of Moscow No. 110 School said: "'How the Steel Was Tempered' is a book that everyone likes very much. I hope that Chinese students can see the film of Paul Kochakin. We often envy the era, the life, and the romanticism that Paul lived in, and romanticism and struggle will never be without. Our life is also beautiful. Our fathers and ancestors fought for it, so that we can study in spacious and bright school classrooms. And we and you should also fight for a bright future, so that our descendants will thank us."
　　The reply from all the students of the second year, second class of Beijing No. 4 Middle School said: "Our studies are very intense. We all know the importance of the tasks on our shoulders. Our motherland's industry and science are still backward, and various difficult jobs are urgently awaiting us. During the winter vacation, more than 900 of our young league members gathered together to commemorate the heroine Liu Hulan. You must also be familiar with her. We love her just like you love Zoya."

### 中苏学生书信往还友情重  互相鼓励　共同学习　一起前进

    中苏学生书信往还友情重
    互相鼓励　共同学习　一起前进
    本报莫斯科25日电　记者李何报道：“伏罗希洛夫同志这次访问中国，又把北京和莫斯科之间的路程缩短很多。”这是塔吉柏娜·塞尔盖夫娜·齐巴洛娃对记者说的。齐巴洛娃是莫斯科一一○学校的教员。她去年访问过我国，带回了我国教师和学生对苏联的亲密的友谊。通过她，北京第四中学的教师和学生同莫斯科一一○学校的教师和学生发生了密切的通讯关系。她告诉我说，她在中国所得的印象是：“中国教师为祖国谋利益的热烈愿望，使我们非常钦佩。中国教师任何时候也不自满。他们十分了解自己负担着多么巨大的任务。”
    齐巴洛娃谈到书信的来往是增进两国人民之间友谊的一个重要方法。她说，现在整个学校，整个班和个别学生之间的通讯，很有好处。她在中国的时候，同北京第四中学的教师们建立了联系。回国以后，用通讯的方法，两个学校一起研究共同的问题：“怎样培养学生独立学习和独立思考的习惯”。她说：
  “这种友谊比什么都宝贵。在中国有许多能干的教师。如果一起研究共同的问题，那么我们的共同事业就会更加迅速地前进。”
    这位有经验的女教师敏锐地看到通讯对于学生的影响。她说：“要是学生的兴趣仅仅限于学校的知识，那是不够的。通讯使学生从伟大的中国交到新朋友。”她拿出一叠来往的信。我读着这些信，觉得中苏两国青年真是心连着心。
    这里摘下这些信中的两段：
    莫斯科一一○学校十年级乙班全体学生的信中说：“‘钢铁是怎样炼成的，这本书大家都很喜欢，希望中国同学能看到保尔·柯察金的影片。我们时常羡慕保尔所过的那种时代、那种生活和浪漫主义，而浪漫主义和斗争永远也不会没有。我们的生活也是美丽的，我们的父祖辈为它斗争过，使得我们能够在宽敞和明亮的学校的课堂里学习。而我们和你们也应当为光明的未来斗争，使得我们的后代感谢我们。”
    北京第四中学高二二班全体学生的回信中说：“我们的学习很紧张，我们都知道我们肩上任务的重大，我们祖国的工业和科学还很落后，各个艰难的工作岗位在迫切地期待我们。在寒假里，我们九百多个青年团员在一起纪念了女英雄刘胡兰。你们一定也很熟悉她，我们热爱她，正像你们热爱卓娅一样”。
