    The Horse and Its Owner

    According to the American "Newsweek," there is a man in West Germany who can argue with Adenauer and address him as "du" (you) in conversation. (In Germany, apart from family members, people generally use the formal "Sie".) This man is Feldmenger.

    This American magazine says that although Feldmenger hasn't spoken in parliament for seven years and rarely appears in public, he is actually one of the most powerful men in West Germany. His office is one of the most important places in Bonn. Feldmenger plays a significant role in every important decision of the Adenauer government. This is evidenced by the following facts:

    In 1949, Feldmenger asked Adenauer to invite Blücher (the current Vice-Chancellor) to form a coalition government together. The coalition government was formed.

    Last summer, Adenauer's position was very unstable. But Adenauer still wanted to push ahead stubbornly. Feldmenger lectured him and scolded him as being simply an "old fool." He told Adenauer to shorten the planned twenty-four-month conscription period, which had aroused strong opposition, to quickly engage in the European unification movement, and to make new gestures on the issue of German reunification, so as to stabilize his position. Adenauer complied.

    Adenauer obeys Feldmenger's orders completely, according to "Newsweek," because he is Adenauer's close friend and most trusted advisor.

    But things are not that simple.

    Everyone is familiar with this Feldmenger, whom Adenauer respectfully mentioned when negotiating with Soviet leaders. He is one of Germany's largest financial monopolists. He first served as a financial advisor to Prime Minister Brüning. After Hitler came to power, he became the boss of the Cologne-Oppenheim Bank. At this time, he vigorously supported Hitler and the Ruhr industrialists economically. Soon he became a director of thirty large enterprises, and Hitler appointed him to be in charge of the defense economy and serve as a central advisor to the Reichsbank. After Hitler's downfall, Feldmenger thought of his "old friend" Adenauer and asked him to found the Christian Democratic Union. In 1945, he, in the name of West German industry, donated one million marks to support Adenauer's rise to power.

    Today, Feldmenger is a giant in West German finance and a powerful representative of Ruhr industry. He controls the Adenauer Party's purse strings and is therefore Adenauer's real backer.

    Feldmenger is fully aware of his relationship with Adenauer, so he bluntly calls Adenauer "the best horse in our stable."

    马和它的主人
    据美国“新闻周刊”说，西德有一个人能够跟阿登纳争论，并且在谈话时用“你”来叫唤他。（在德国除了家里人外，一般都称“您”）这个人就是费尔德门格斯。
    这家美国杂志说，虽然七年来费尔德门格斯没有在议会发表过谈话，很少在公开场合露脸；但是他实际上是西德最有权势的一个人。他的办公室是波恩最重要的地方之一。在阿登纳政府每一个重要的决定上，费尔德门格斯都起着显著的作用。这有事实为证：
    在1949年费尔德门格斯要阿登纳邀集布吕希（现任副总理）一起组织联合政府。联合政府组成了。
    去年夏天，阿登纳的地位非常不稳。但是阿登纳仍想蛮干下去。费尔德门格斯就教训了他一顿，骂他简直像个“老笨蛋”。他叫阿登纳把引起了强烈反对的、原计划二十四个月的兵役期缩短，赶快搞欧洲统一运动，并且在德国统一问题上作出新的姿态，如此这般来稳定自己的地位。阿登纳照办了。
    阿登纳对费尔德门格斯唯命是从，据“新闻周刊”说，是因为他是阿登纳的密友和最亲信的顾问。
    事情并不这样简单。
    对于阿登纳在同苏联领导人谈判的时候都尊敬地提到的这个费尔德门格斯，大家并不陌生。他是德国最大的金融垄断资本家之一。最早他当过布朗宁总理的财政顾问。在希特勒上台之后，他当上了科隆——小奥本海银行的老板。这时他竭力在经济上支持希特勒和鲁尔工业家。不久他就成了三十个大企业的董事，希特勒委他负责国防经济并担任了帝国银行中央顾问。希特勒垮台后，费尔德门格斯想到了他的“老朋友”阿登纳，要他创立了基督教民主联盟。1945年他以西德工业界名义掏出一百万马克支持阿登纳上台。
    今天费尔德门格斯是西德金融界的巨头，鲁尔工业界有势力的代表，他掌管着阿登纳党的钱袋，因而是阿登纳的真正的后台老板。
    费尔德门格斯是完全了解他同阿登纳的这个关系的，所以他直截了当地称阿登纳是他们“马厩中最好的马”。　（生）
