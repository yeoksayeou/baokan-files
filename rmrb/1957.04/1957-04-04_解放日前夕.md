    On the Eve of Liberation Day
    By Our Correspondent Hu Jibang
    The heavy fog that often hangs over the Danube has dissipated, and the sky has become clear and lovely. In Budapest, known as the "City of Parks," one can smell the fresh scent of new vegetation everywhere. On the branches that withered in the harsh winter, tender red and green leaves have begun to sprout. The open spaces are covered with lush green grass. In the orchards, the apricot and cherry blossoms are about to bloom. Amidst the city's noisy motors, one can still hear the singing of spring birds. The earth has returned to its spring appearance.
    The Hungarian people are celebrating the national Liberation Day in April with a special mood this year. Unlike in previous years, the Hungarian people are not commemorating this festival with colorful decorations or joyous music and dance, but with a solemn, thoughtful, and revolutionary responsible spirit. An increasing number of people have realized that they should diligently cultivate and sow on this free land of spring, and cherish the beautiful flowers and plants bestowed by nature, rather than arbitrarily picking and trampling them. The events of October demonstrated that many people in the past did not truly recognize the significance of the Soviet army's liberation, nor did they cherish the freedom they had not been able to achieve in their own four hundred years of struggle.
    On the eve of the festival this year, people are not busy rushing to the stores to shop, but are more interested in attending mass rallies and listening to political reports. In the past two days, people have been talking everywhere about the mass rallies held in several places in Budapest, attended by more than 100,000 people. In particular, the mass rally in Republic Square has special historical significance, because the counter-revolutionary White Terror began here. The more than 50,000 people gathered in the square unanimously shouted their gratitude to the Soviet Union and finally sang the Internationale.
    On March 30, a parade of more than 5,000 workers' pickets was organized in Budapest. They were men and women, old and young, each carrying weapons, wearing plain gray uniforms, and wearing dark blue "Comrade" caps. Someone told me that they had borrowed the hat of one of our Chinese comrades to use as a model. In any case, their simple and spirited fighting spirit has aroused great interest among the citizens. Passersby on the street waved to congratulate them, and many people said with admiration that if they had been organized last year, the tragic events of October might have been avoided. Rooted in the masses, they are a reliable force in security work.
    Another major event that has increased the festive mood is the return of the Party and government delegation from Moscow with fruitful negotiation results. The Soviet people have once again demonstrated their great generosity and selfless friendship towards the Hungarian people by providing generous and huge assistance. This will play an extremely important role in helping Hungary overcome its current economic difficulties.
    The red star on the Soviet soldier monument in Freedom Square, which was destroyed by counter-revolutionaries, has been restored. On the 4th, solemn ceremonies will be held in Freedom Square and Heroes' Square in Hungary. Representatives from all sectors of the Hungarian Party, government, and military, including some diplomatic missions, will present wreaths separately. This year, in order to save manpower and material resources, the customary military parade will not be held.

    解放日前夕
    本报记者　胡济邦
    经常弥漫在多瑙河上空的浓雾已经消散了，天空变得清朗可爱。这个被称为公园城的布达佩斯，到处都可以闻到一种草木新生的气息。在严冬里枯萎了的树枝上，已开始生出了一片片红色和绿色的嫩叶。空地上铺展着如茵的青草。果园中的杏花和樱花，正在含苞待放。在城市喧嚣的马达声中，仍可听见春鸟的歌唱。大地已经恢复了春天的景象。
    匈牙利人民今年以一种特殊的心情来庆祝4月的全国解放日。今年与往年不同，匈牙利人民不是用五采缤纷的装璜，不是用狂欢的音乐和舞蹈来纪念这个节日的，而是充满着一种严肃深思、革命负责的情绪来纪念这个节日的。愈来愈多的人已经注意到在这块春天的自由的土地上应该辛勤地耕耘、播种，应该爱护自然所赐予的美丽花草，而不是任意采摘践踏。十月事件的过程说明了过去许多人没有真正认识到苏军解放的意义，没有珍惜这种在自己四百多年的斗争中未能得到的自由。
    今年节日的前夕，人们不是忙着挤到商店去采购，而是对参加群众大会、听取政治报告更感兴趣了。这两天，人们到处谈论着布达佩斯市内几处举行的、有十万多人参加的群众大会，特别是共和国广场上的群众大会具有着特殊的历史意义，因为反革命的白色恐怖是从这里开始的。广场上聚集着的五万多群众，曾一致喊出了对苏联的感谢，最后高唱国际歌。
    3月30日，在布达佩斯组织了五千多名工人纠察队的游行。他们有男的女的，有老的少的，每人都携带武器，穿着朴素的灰色制服，戴着深蓝色的“同志”帽。有人告诉我，他们曾借了我们一位中国同志的帽子去做式样。不管怎样，他们这种带有朴实气质的战斗情绪，已引起市民的极大兴趣。街上行人向他们招手庆贺，并有不少人带着赞叹的口吻说，如果去年就把他们组织起来，十月的悲惨事件或可避免。他们扎根在群众中间，这是保卫工作中的一支可靠的力量。
    增进节日情绪的另一件大事是党和政府代表团带着谈判中的丰富成果从莫斯科回来了。苏联人民再度表现对匈牙利人民的伟大胸怀和无私的友谊，提供了慷慨的巨额援助。这对匈牙利克服当前经济困难将起着极其重大的作用。
    自由广场上的苏军战士纪念碑上曾被反革命分子破毁的一颗红星，已被修复起来。4日那天，在自由广场和匈牙利历代英雄广场上将要举行隆重的典礼。匈牙利的党政军各界并包括一些外交使团，都将分别奉献花圈。今年为了节省人力物力，惯例的阅兵典礼不拟举行了。
