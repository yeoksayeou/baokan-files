Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, April 9th: The Suez Canal has been completely cleared. The assistant to General Wheeler, the United Nations representative assisting Egypt in clearing the canal, announced this last night in Ismailia. He announced that the last sunken ship obstructing navigation in the canal, the "Aboukir," had been towed by the United Nations salvage team to the Great Bitter Lake in the middle of the canal.

A few hours before this announcement, General Wheeler met with reporters at his headquarters in Ismailia. He said that with the removal of the "Aboukir," the canal would return to its usual depth—thirty-three to thirty-four feet.

He said that the restoration work on all aspects of the canal had been completed. Only three non-obstructive sunken ships remained in Port Said; they did not affect navigation and could be salvaged later. Telecommunications and lighting equipment had also been fully restored and improved. The canal's workshops had been restored to 90%, and some equipment was on its way.

He said that the Egyptian authorities would continue dredging operations, with the United Nations paying part of the cost.

General Wheeler said: "The Egyptian authorities have cooperated very well with us. I personally met many Egyptian technicians, and their abilities gave me a very good impression."

    苏伊士运河全部清理完毕
    新华社开罗9日电　苏伊士运河已经全部清理完毕，协助埃及清理运河的联合国代表惠勒将军的助理昨晚在伊士美利亚宣布了这一点。他当时宣布，阻碍运河通航的最后一艘沉船“阿布赫尔号”已经由联合国的打捞队拖往运河中段的大苦湖。
    在这个消息宣布以前几小时，惠勒将军在伊士美利亚他的总部中接见了记者们。他说，由于清除了“阿布赫尔号”，运河将恢复到它通常的深度——三十三英尺到三十四英尺。
    他说，运河的各方面的恢复工作已经完成。只有三艘没有妨碍的沉船仍然留在塞得港，它们并不影响通航，因此可以在以后打捞。电讯和灯光设备也已经全部恢复，并且得到了一些改进。运河的工场恢复了90％，还有一些装备正在运来途中。
    他说，埃及当局将继续进行疏浚工作，由联合国支付一部分费用。
    惠勒将军说：“埃及当局同我们合作得很好。我个人认识了许多埃及技术人员，他们的能力给了我非常良好的印象。”
