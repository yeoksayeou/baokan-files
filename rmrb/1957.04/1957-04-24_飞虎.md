    Flying Tiger
    Do you know a rare Chinese medicine called "Blood Spirit Seed"? It is a specific medicine for treating women's diseases. This medicine is not easy to obtain, and sometimes one must risk their life to get it.
    Where does this medicine come from? It's quite peculiar. In some cliffs in Sichuan Province, there is an animal that looks like a tiger, larger than a cat but smaller than a leopard, with wings, and sharp small teeth on the wings, called "Flying Tiger." The female tiger menstruates once a month, and the congealed blood forms a hard lump, which is the "Blood Spirit Seed." To obtain it, mountain farmers must tie themselves with ropes and hang down from cliffs several yards high, climbing into the Flying Tiger's habitat to find it. However, the Flying Tiger often uses its wings to cut the ropes, causing those seeking the Blood Spirit Seed to fall off the cliff and lose their lives.
    A farmer in Zhuxian Township, Wushan County, Sichuan Province, after observing that the Flying Tiger goes out to forage every evening and has a downward flying habit, recently captured one. Now that mountain hunters understand the habits of the Flying Tiger, the supply of "Blood Spirit Seed" is expected to increase.

    飞虎
    你知道一种罕见的叫“血灵子”的中药吗？它是治妇女病的特效药。这种药得来颇不容易，有时要冒着生命危险才能得到。
    这种药是哪里来的？说来也很稀奇。在四川省境的一些悬崖绝壁中，有一种形如老虎，比猫大，比豹小，长着翅膀，翅上还有尖利小齿的动物，叫“飞虎”。雌虎每月行经一次，凝结成硬块，这就是“血灵子”。山区农民要得到它，必须用绳系着身子从几丈高的悬岩吊下去，爬进飞虎的住处去找。可是飞虎常常用翅膀割断吊绳，使寻找血灵子的人落崖丧生。
    四川巫山县竹贤乡的一个农民，观察到飞虎每到傍晚出外觅食，而且飞势向下的习性以后，不久前猎取了一只。山区猎手们懂得了飞虎的习性以后，“血灵子”的供应可望增加。
