Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 7th -- The Wuhan area held a university student representative meeting. Three hundred and sixty-one student representatives from nineteen universities and colleges in Wuhan City attended. The meeting lasted three days and closed on the 6th.

At the meeting, the representatives made suggestions and opinions to the school leadership, local government, and Wuhan City Student Federation, and also launched heated discussions on the relationship between politics and professional work, running schools diligently and thriftily, and other issues.

All the representatives attending the meeting also wrote a letter to university students in the Wuhan area. The letter said: We must strive to improve our communist ideological awareness, transform our thinking, and constantly arm ourselves with new knowledge, so as to cultivate ourselves into socialist university students of a new China. Only in this way can we assume the great mission of inheriting the revolutionary cause forged by the blood of countless revolutionary martyrs. The letter called on university students in the Wuhan area to carry forward the glorious revolutionary tradition of Chinese educated youth, closely integrate with workers and peasants, and firmly establish the idea of serving workers and peasants.

Representatives from fifteen secondary technical schools in the Wuhan area also attended the meeting as observers.
