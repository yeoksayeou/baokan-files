Column: Editor's Notes

    The news report "An Idle Person in the Agricultural Cooperative" exposes Huang Hechang, a staff member who, burdened by the desire for personal fame and status, became the most peculiar idle person in the busy agricultural cooperative after coming to the countryside. He used complete inaction to express his dissatisfaction with the superiors' transfer, refusing to use his brain or contribute any effort to the work of the agricultural cooperative. It was as if, otherwise, he would "suffer" even more and feel even more "wronged." Such a person completely lost his sense of responsibility for the cause of socialism.

    Xu Shu, who served as a strategist in Cao Cao's ruling structure during the Three Kingdoms period, never devised a single plan for Cao Cao throughout his life. He was "in Cao's camp but his heart was with Han," unwilling to go against his will and serve those he opposed. Without commenting on the correctness of Xu Shu's political views and behavior, he at least had his own reasons. However, it is difficult to say what reasons Huang Hechang, a rural worker in Xinhui County, could give for not being willing to "devise a plan" for the work of the agricultural cooperative for more than a year since coming to the countryside. He is in the countryside, but his heart is in the town. The only goal pursued by people like him, whether in the countryside or in the town, is personal status and material enjoyment. These people "eat their fill all day long" and "are not concerned about" the people's cause, but they spend a lot of effort on their personal interests. For example, they put a lot of thought into "comparing": comparing status, comparing wages, comparing treatment. All their complaints, sorrows, and "illnesses" stem from this.

    Those who come to the countryside burdened with extremely heavy ideological baggage, engage in inaction and dereliction of duty, and become idle people in agricultural cooperatives are individual cases among our rural workers; however, there are definitely more people with this kind of thinking than just Huang Hechang in Xinhui County. It is hoped that these people can wake up and transform themselves from idle people disliked by the masses into good cadres welcomed by the masses. The key to achieving this lies in abandoning some dirty, selfish, big and small plans for personal gain and linking one's own fate with the fate of the 500 million farmers who have infinitely bright prospects.

    The vast majority of rural work comrades, including the large number of "transferred cadres" recently sent to the grassroots, are working actively and diligently. However, it is also worth considering: How do the things we have already done compare with the requirements of the Party and the state, and with the desires of the broad masses of farmers to develop production and improve their lives? The Party's call is: Do everything possible to strive for a bumper harvest. The broad masses of farmers are waiting for us to help them find more ways to increase production and more plans to increase production, and to help them realize these. Many comrades are not "idle people" in agricultural cooperatives, but when it is time to be busy, are they wholeheartedly busy, and are they busy in the right way? In this regard, it is worth constantly reminding and encouraging oneself. If we are going to "compare," let's compete to see who comes up with the most and the best plans for achieving a bumper harvest!

    比什么
    “农业社里的一个闲人”这篇通讯揭露了黄和昌这样一个工作人员，他背着追求个人名誉、地位的思想包袱来到乡下以后，就成了忙碌的农业合作社里的一个最稀奇的闲人。他用彻底的怠工来表示他对于上级的调动的不满，他不肯为农业社的工作动一动脑筋，出一点力量。好像如果不是这样，他就更“吃亏”、更“委屈”了。这样一个人，完全丧失了对于社会主义事业的责任感。
    三国时代在曹操的统治机构中充当谋士的徐庶，终身未曾为曹操设一计。他“身在曹营而心在汉”，不肯违背自己的意志，为他所反对的人服务。这里且不评论徐庶的政治观点和行为正确与否，他总算有他自己的一番道理。但是，新会县的农村工作人员黄和昌下乡一年有余，而不肯为农业社的工作“设一计”，却很难说出什么道理来。他身在乡村而心在城镇。像他这种人，不论在乡村或者在城镇，所追求的唯一目标，只是个人的地位和物质享受。这种人“饱食终日”，对于人民的事业“无所用心”，但对于个人的私利却费了不少心机。比方，在“比”上就花了许多脑筋：比地位，比工资，比待遇。一切感慨、悲伤和“疾病”都由此而生。
    背上极其沉重的思想包袱下乡、实行怠工渎职、在农业社里做闲人的人，在我们的农村工作人员中间，是个别的；但是，有这种思想的人决不止新会县的一个黄和昌。希望这些人能够翻然猛省，由群众所讨厌的闲人变成群众所欢迎的好干部。做到这一点的关键，在于抛弃个人的一些肮脏的、自私的大大小小的打算，把自己的命运同有着无限光明前途的五万万农民的命运联结在一起。
    绝大多数农村工作同志，包括最近被派到基层的大批“下放干部”在内，都在积极地、刻苦地进行工作。但是，也还可以再想一想：我们已经做了的事情，同党和国家的要求比起来，同广大农民的发展生产、改善生活的愿望比起来，又怎么样？党的号召是：千方百计地争取大丰收。广大农民正在等待着我们帮助他们去寻更多的增产之“方”，找更多的增产之“计”，并且帮助他们去实现这些。许多同志虽不是农业社里的“闲人”，但是，在应该忙的时候，是不是全心全意地忙了，而且忙得是不是对头呢？在这方面，值得经常提醒自己，鞭策自己。如果要“比”，就来比赛看谁为争取大丰收设的计又多又好吧！
