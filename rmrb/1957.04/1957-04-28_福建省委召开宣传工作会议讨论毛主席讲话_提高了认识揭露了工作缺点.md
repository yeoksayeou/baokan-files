Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou Dispatch: The Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened a provincial propaganda work conference to convey and discuss Chairman Mao's speeches at the Supreme State Conference and the National Propaganda Work Conference.

    After discussion, the cadres present at the meeting improved their understanding, and many also criticized their past views, such as thinking that "Now that we have entered socialism, there are still so many problems, which is an abnormal phenomenon," and "Things are getting more and more difficult, and I don't know what to do." After discussion and comparison with the development and changes in actual work, the majority of cadres firmly believed that as long as correct methods are adopted to handle contradictions among the people, they can not only be resolved correctly, but also promote the progress of various tasks.

    The meeting criticized the erroneous practices existing in some rural work where attention was not paid to overcoming shortcomings in work and in the work style of cadres, attention was not paid to patiently persuading and educating the people, and the label of "landlord and rich peasant ideology" was often applied to the masses who had opinions. At the same time, the meeting criticized the right-leaning sentiments of some cadres in the previous period who did not pay attention to analyzing the merits and demerits of various thoughts and did not promptly carry out ideological education for the masses.

    The conference held heated discussions on the principle of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend." Most cadres believed that the current situation was not "too much freedom," but "insufficient freedom." They believed that in order to improve the understanding of the broad masses inside and outside the Party, and to stop the phenomenon of crude interference, it is necessary to continue to boldly implement the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend."

    This conference was conducted under the direct leadership of the Secretariat of the Fujian Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China. Ye Fei, the First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, gave a summary report to the conference on behalf of the Provincial Party Committee.

    A total of 583 people attended the conference, including 127 non-Party members; more than 400 others attended as observers.

    福建省委召开宣传工作会议讨论毛主席讲话
    提高了认识揭露了工作缺点
    据新华社福州电　中共福建省委最近召开全省宣传工作会议，传达和讨论毛主席在最高国务会议上和在全国宣传工作会议上的讲话。
    到会干部在讨论以后，认识提高了，不少人还批判了自己过去的看法，如认为“进入社会主义了，问题还有这么多，这是不正常的现象，”“事情越来越难办了，不知如何是好”等等。经过讨论并且对照实际工作情况的发展变化，大多数干部坚定地相信，人民内部的矛盾只要采取正确的方法来处理，不仅可以得到正确的解决，而且可以推动各种工作的前进。
    会议批判了目前有些地方农村工作存在的不注意克服工作中和干部思想作风上的缺点，不注意向人民群众进行耐心的说服教育，对有意见的群众往往加上“地主富农思想”的大帽子的错误做法。同时，会议批判了前一时期部分干部不注意分析各种思想的是非、不及时向群众进行思想教育的右倾情绪。
    会议对“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针进行了热烈的讨论。多数干部认为：目前不是“放得有余”，而是“放得不足”。他们认为，要提高党内外广大群众的认识，要制止粗暴干涉现象，必须继续放手贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针。
    这次会议是在中共福建省委书记处直接领导下进行的。省委第一书记叶飞代表省委向大会作了总结报告。
    参加这次会议的共有五百八十三人，其中党外人士一百二十七人；另有四百多人列席会议。
