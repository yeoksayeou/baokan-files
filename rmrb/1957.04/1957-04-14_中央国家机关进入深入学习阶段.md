    Central State Organs Enter Deep Learning Stage
    (Our report) The study of Chairman Mao's speech at the enlarged meeting of the Supreme State Conference is currently being gradually rolled out among the vast number of staff members of the various commissions, ministries, committees, and bureaus of the central state organs.
    Since Chairman Mao's speech, the leading comrades of various units of the central state organs have successively delivered reports to all cadres of their units, conveying the main spirit of the speech. Most of the directors and deputy directors of bureaus and some staff members have also listened to the recording of Chairman Mao's speech. Some units' Party committees, after delivering the reports, promptly organized symposiums and discussions among Party members, non-Party members, and staff to guide everyone in understanding the main spirit of the report.
    During the discussions, the vast majority of people were very excited and moved. Some said that Chairman Mao's speech "hit the nail on the head and solved problems," while others said that Chairman Mao's speech was "full of revolutionary optimism, which made people clear-headed and broad-minded, and resolved many vague concepts." Some people originally thought that the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" was only for the literary and scientific circles, but after hearing the report, they further realized that this policy was a long-term and patient method of Marxist-Leninist education for intellectuals by the Party, and its purpose was to promote the rapid development and prosperity of science and literature in our country under the guidance of Marxism, rather than simply to eliminate some poisonous weeds.
    During the discussion, some people asked what the manifestations of contradictions among the people are in the central state organs. Some people believed that the manifestations of contradictions among the people in the central state organs are: the contradiction between bureaucracy and actual work, and the contradiction between leaders and the led. The former is manifested in work, such as bloated institutions, overstaffing, not going deep into reality, not understanding the situation below, making subjective decisions, executing orders, and not conducting inspections, which leads to serious shortcomings and errors in the work, etc.; the latter is manifested in human relations, such as the relationship between leading cadres and ordinary cadres, the relationship between the Party and the masses, and the relationship between the Party and intellectuals, etc. Some also criticized the leadership on this point: some leading cadres only have an office relationship with ordinary cadres, and after being together for several years, they still don't know each other's names, and the class feelings of officers and soldiers being united as one are becoming less and less. Some comrades who were transferred from the military also said: "The Party in the army is a loving mother, while the Party in the organs is a stepmother." Some commented that ideological work in the state organs has the bias of generalization and dogmatism, and often does not convince people with reason but simply slaps a label on them.
    Currently, the vast number of staff members in the central state organs have gradually entered the stage of in-depth study.

    中央国家机关进入深入学习阶段
    本报讯　学习毛主席在最高国务会议扩大会议上的讲话，目前在中央国家机关各委、部、会、局的广大工作人员中，正在逐步开展。
    从毛主席讲话后，中央国家机关各单位的负责同志，陆续将这一讲话的主要精神，向各单位的全体干部，做了传达报告。大多数司、局负责同志和一部分工作人员，还先后听过了主席讲话的录音。有些单位的党委，在传达报告之后，及时地组织党内外工作人员进行了座谈和讨论，引导大家领会报告的主要精神。
    讨论中，绝大多数人都十分兴奋，感动。有人说毛主席的讲话“入木三分，很解决问题”，有人说毛主席的讲话“充满了革命的乐观主义，使人头脑清醒，心胸开阔，解决了许多模糊观念”。有人原认为
  “百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针，只是文艺科学界的事，听了传达报告后，才进一步了解到这一政策方针是党对知识分子长期的、耐心的进行马克思列宁主义教育的方法，其目的是促进我国的科学、文艺在马克思主义的指导下迅速的发展繁荣，而不是单纯地为了消灭一些毒草的。
    讨论中，有的人提出人民内部矛盾在中央国家机关的表现形式是什么？一部分人认为：人民内部矛盾在中央国家机关的表现形式是：官僚主义与实际工作的矛盾、领导与被领导的矛盾。前一方面表现在工作上，如机构庞大、人浮于事、不深入实际、不了解下情、主观决定、命令执行、不做检查，使工作中发生严重的缺点错误等等；后一方面则表现在人的关系上，如领导干部与被领导干部的关系、党群关系、党与知识分子关系等等。有的还就此对领导上提出批评：有的领导干部与一般干部只是办公室的关系，相处几年还不知道人家叫什么名字，过去那种官兵一致的阶级情感越来越少了。部队转业的同志也有人说：
  “部队党是亲娘，机关党是后娘”。有人评述国家机关中的思想工作，存在着一般化同教条主义的偏向，往往不是以理服人而扣一顶帽子了事。
    目前，中央国家机关广大工作人员，已逐渐进入深入学习的阶段。
