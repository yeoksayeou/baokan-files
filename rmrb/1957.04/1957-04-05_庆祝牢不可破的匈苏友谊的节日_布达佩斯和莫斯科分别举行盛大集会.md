Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, April 4th. On April 3rd, the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, the Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government, together with the National Council of the Patriotic People's Front and the National Federation of Free Trade Unions, held a grand gathering in Budapest to celebrate the 12th anniversary of Hungary's liberation.

Kádár, Prime Minister of the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government, Dobi, Chairman of the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic, Rónai, Speaker of the National Assembly, and other leaders of the Party and government attended the meeting. They were warmly welcomed by the masses attending the meeting.

Márosán said:
We are proud of the people's democratic system that has been implemented for twelve years; further deepening the friendship with socialist countries, especially with the Soviet people, is a great national cause of Hungary.

State Minister Márosán gave a report on the 12th anniversary of Hungary's liberation at the meeting. He said that April 4th is a festival of unbreakable Hungarian-Soviet friendship. The Hungarian people will never forget that they should thank the Soviet Union. Today, as we celebrate our liberation day, we should say that we are proud of the people's democratic system that we have implemented for twelve years. Despite the mistakes, this system has benefited the Hungarian people a thousand times more than any century in the past. The establishment of the workers' regime and the construction of socialism are great achievements of the broad masses of the Hungarian working people.

Márosán pointed out the great significance of the Soviet Union's assistance to Hungary in crushing the counter-revolutionary rebellion between October and November last year. He said that the imperialists should see that no country in the socialist camp will ever become a victim of imperialist robbers. As for the so-called slogan of "national communism," we firmly oppose it. He said that only the alliance and friendly relations with the socialist Soviet Union can defend Hungary's independence.

When talking about the characteristics of the period after the October events, Márosán emphasized that the consolidation of the Hungarian working class party is a great achievement made in this period. He said that we are building a fighting party and defending its glory, and at the same time we know the past glory of our party. We will strengthen the vanguard role of our party, especially now.

Márosán talked about Hungary's relations with the countries of the socialist camp. He emphasized that further deepening the friendship between the Hungarian people and the people of the socialist countries, especially the Soviet people, is our great national cause. We must establish closer friendly ties with the People's Republic of China, whose friendly assistance has greatly promoted Hungary's consolidation.

Márosán's report was interrupted by lasting applause more than once.

After the meeting, a performance was held.

Xinhua News Agency, April 4th. According to TASS: A grand celebration was held in Moscow on the 3rd to celebrate the 12th anniversary of Hungary's liberation. Tarasov, Vice Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Mikhailov, Minister of Culture, Patolichev, First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, and others attended the meeting.

Bordoczki, the Hungarian Ambassador to the Soviet Union, the Hungarian cultural workers delegation currently visiting the Soviet Union, and diplomatic envoys from various countries also attended the meeting.

The meeting was presided over by Grishin, Chairman of the Central Council of Trade Unions of the Soviet Union.

Pospelov said:
We will continue to do everything possible to strengthen our proletarian unity and mutual assistance, promote Soviet-Hungarian friendship, and promote the struggle for peace and socialism, and for further enhancing the power and combat unity of the socialist countries' big family.

Pospelov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, gave a report at the meeting. He said that on this day, the Soviet people, together with the working people of the people's democratic countries and progressive people all over the world, warmly salute the Hungarian people and congratulate them on their National Day. Hungary has achieved great victories in the twelve years since its liberation. During the twenty-five years of Horthy-fascist rule, Hungary's total industrial output only increased by 20%, while in the era of people's power, industrial production increased by more than two times.

Pospelov then analyzed in detail the causes and course of the Hungarian October events. He emphasized that the Hungarian events show that the imperialist forces have not only not given up their attempts to undermine the solidarity of socialist countries by all means, but are also taking extreme measures in an attempt to defeat socialist countries one by one. Defeating the Hungarian counter-revolutionary forces is a major victory for the forces of peace and socialism over the forces of aggression and imperialism, and a victory for the entire camp of peace, democracy and socialism. This victory shows the strength sufficient to resolutely repel any attempt to infringe upon the vital interests of any member of this camp.

Pospelov talked about the great significance of the talks between the delegations of the Hungarian and Soviet governments and parties. He said that the unity and fraternal mutual assistance of the big family of socialist countries is the greatest force sufficient to crush the despicable conspiracies of any aggressor, and is a reliable pillar of the cause of world peace. All socialist countries have provided and are still providing great moral support and material assistance to the Hungarian people and their Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government. We unanimously believe that the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party can overcome the existing difficulties and complete its lofty tasks, and further enhance its leading role in the country's national and socio-political life. We will continue to do everything possible to strengthen our proletarian unity and mutual assistance, promote Soviet-Hungarian friendship, and promote the struggle for peace and socialism, and for further enhancing the power and combat unity of the socialist countries' big family.

At the meeting, Valida Pfeifer, the head of the Hungarian cultural workers delegation, delivered a congratulatory message. On this day, the leaders of the Communist Party and the state of the Soviet Union sent telegrams to the leaders of the Party and the state of Hungary to congratulate them on the festival. Moscow also held a Soviet-Hungarian youth get-together and a photo exhibition on Hungary.

    庆祝牢不可破的匈苏友谊的节日
    布达佩斯和莫斯科分别举行盛大集会
    新华社布达佩斯4日电　4月3日，匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会、工农革命政府会同爱国人民阵线全国委员会和自由工会全国联合会在布达佩斯举行了盛大的集会，庆祝匈牙利解放十二周年。
    匈牙利工农革命政府总理卡达尔、匈牙利人民共和国主席团主席道比、国民议会主席罗奈伊以及党和政府的其他领导人参加了会议。他们受到参加会议的群众的热烈欢迎。
    马罗山说
    我们为实行了十二年的人民民主制度而骄傲；进一步加深同社会主义国家首先是同苏联人民的友谊是匈牙利伟大的民族事业。
    国务部长马罗山在会上作了关于匈牙利解放十二周年的报告。他说，4月4日是牢不可破的匈苏友谊的节日。匈牙利人民永远不会忘记，他们应当感谢苏联。今天在庆祝我们解放的日子里，我们应当说，我们为我们实行了十二年的人民民主制度而骄傲，尽管有过错误，但是，这个制度给匈牙利人民的好处比过去任何一个世纪都要多上一千倍。工人政权的建立和社会主义的建设，是匈牙利劳动人民广大群众的伟大成就。
    马罗山指出了苏联援助匈牙利粉碎去年10月—11月间反革命叛乱的重大意义。他说，帝国主义分子应当看到，社会主义阵营始终没有一个国家会成为帝国主义强盗的牺牲者。至于所谓“民族共产主义”的口号，我们坚决反对。他说，只有同社会主义苏联的联盟和友好关系才能保卫住匈牙利的独立。
    马罗山在谈到十月事件以后这个时期的特点的时候强调说，匈牙利工人阶级政党的巩固是这个时期里所取得的巨大成就。他说，我们在建设战斗的党并且保卫它的光荣，我们同时知道我们党过去的光荣。我们将加强我们党的先锋作用，特别是在现在。
    马罗山谈到了匈牙利同社会主义阵营各国的关系。他强调说，进一步加深匈牙利人民同各社会主义国家人民、首先是同苏联人民的友谊是我们伟大的民族事业。我们必须同中华人民共和国建立起更加紧密的友好联系，中华人民共和国的友好援助在很大程度上促进了匈牙利的巩固。
    马罗山的报告不止一次地被经久不息的掌声所打断。
    会议闭幕以后，举行了演出会。
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社报道：莫斯科3日举行盛大庆祝会，庆祝匈牙利解放十二周年。参加大会的有苏联最高苏维埃主席团副主席塔拉索夫、文化部长米哈伊洛夫、外交部第一副部长帕托利切夫等人。
    参加大会的还有匈牙利驻苏联大使波尔多茨基、目前在苏联访问的匈牙利文化工作者代表团和各国外交使节。
    大会由全苏工会中央理事会主席格里申主持。
    波斯伯洛夫说
    我们今后仍将尽一切力量来加强我们的无产阶级团结和互助关系，发扬苏匈友谊，以推进为和平和社会主义事业、为进一步增强社会主义国家大家庭的威力和战斗团结所进行的斗争。
    苏联共产党中央委员会书记波斯伯洛夫在会上作了报告。他说，苏联人民同人民民主国家的劳动人民和全世界进步人士一起，在这一天向匈牙利人民热烈致意和祝贺他们的国庆节。匈牙利在解放以来十二年中取得了重大胜利。在霍尔蒂—法西斯统治的二十五年期间，匈牙利工业生产总产量只增加了20％，而在人民政权年代中，工业生产量增加了两倍多。
    波斯伯洛夫接着详细分析了匈牙利十月事件的原因和经过。他强调说，匈牙利事件表明，帝国主义势力不仅没有放弃他们用一切手段来破坏社会主义各国团结的试图，而且正在采取极端措施，试图各个击破社会主义国家。击溃匈牙利反革命势力，是和平力量和社会主义力量对侵略势力和帝国主义势力的重大胜利，是整个和平、民主和社会主义阵营的胜利，这一胜利显示了足以坚决回击侵犯这一阵营任何成员的切身利益的一切企图的力量。
    波斯伯洛夫谈到了匈苏两国政府和党的代表团的会谈的重大意义。他说，社会主义国家大家庭的团结一致和兄弟互助，是足以粉碎任何侵略者的卑鄙阴谋的最伟大的力量，是世界和平事业的可靠支柱。所有社会主义国家向匈牙利人民及其工农革命政府提供了、现在还在提供巨大的道义上的支持和物质援助，我们一致相信，匈牙利社会主义工人党能够克服现有的困难，完成自己的崇高任务，更进一步提高自己在本国的国家和社会政治生活中的领导作用。我们今后仍将尽一切力量来加强我们的无产阶级团结和互助关系，发扬苏匈友谊，以推进为和平和社会主义事业、为进一步增强社会主义国家大家庭的威力和战斗团结所进行的斗争。
    会上，匈牙利文化工作者代表团团长瓦利达普费利致了贺词。这一天，苏联共产党和国家领导人曾致电匈牙利党和国家领导人祝贺节日。莫斯科还举行了苏匈青年联欢会和关于匈牙利的图片展览。
