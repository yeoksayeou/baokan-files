    The Rumanov Family
    Dai Feng
    In the office of the Party Committee Secretary of the "Hammer and Sickle" Steel Plant in Moscow, Party Committee Deputy Secretary Chairov introduced me to the old foreman, Ivan Mikhailovich Rumanov. I planned to visit him at his home.
    It was an evening, and I crossed Red Square and walked along the embankment of the thawing Moscow River towards Rumanov's residence. I found Rumanov's home on the third floor of a seven-story building on the Gachilin Qi shore. The host greeted me warmly. He was short but very strong, with sparse hair that was slightly gray. From his faded work clothes, it could be seen that he was busy helping with housework!
    Rumanov led me through the narrow hallway into the guest room. Here, as in the typical Moscow guest rooms I had seen, it was comfortable and clean. In the center of the room was a round table covered with a crimson velvet tablecloth. Around it were three half-new leather-backed chairs. A two-section glass cabinet stood close to the left wall. Through the bright glass, one could see a variety of glass and porcelain utensils. A dark brown wardrobe stood in the corner on the right. In front of the window was a small television, next to which was a long sofa covered with a spotless white sofa cover.
    We had just sat down around the table when Rumanov's wife, Yevdagiya Ivanovna, came in. She was not tall, her demeanor was steady, and she was dressed like a typical housewife: a simple, faded dress with a white apron over it.
    The hostess said with a smile, "See how spacious we live now; a guest room, two bedrooms, a kitchen, almost everything."
      "You have seen our present life," Rumanov continued, "However, this prosperous life has been gradually improved year by year."
    There are four people in the Rumanov family, they have two daughters: Damala, who is already working, and Galya, who is studying at the Steel Institute. Rumanov came from a poor peasant background. When he was fourteen, his father and mother sent him to St. Petersburg to become an apprentice in order to avoid being tormented to death by hunger. During the October Revolution, he was first captured and forced to join the White Army, and later, he joined the Red Army. After the victory, he retired and came to Moscow. In 1923, he entered the "Hammer and Sickle" Steel Plant as an apprentice.
      "I remember very clearly," Rumanov recalled, "In the early years after the victory of the revolution, our life was better than before, but it was still very difficult. At that time, I had just married Yevdagiya, and both of us worked, and our monthly salary was just enough to maintain our lives. Whenever we added a new piece of clothing or new furniture, we still had to borrow some money."
    "Earlier, we lived in a room of only ten square meters, and there was little furniture in the room besides a bed," Yevdagiya interjected, "We calculated the money spent on food and daily necessities very carefully, saving as much as we could, not daring to waste even a kopek."
    Rumanov went out for a moment while I was talking to the hostess. When he returned, he had changed his work clothes for a dark gray suit with white stripes. A plain tie was tied on his striped silk shirt. My gaze couldn't help but fall on his suit.
    Rumanov said, "Although this suit is almost ten years old, it is still quite new and fits well. I am reluctant to wear it when I go to work in the factory!"
    At this time, the hostess told a story: Rumanov not only saves money on weekdays, but also cherishes his clothes very much. His winter coat is also ten years old. The fluff on the collar and cuffs of the coat has long been worn out, but the coat's surface is still very good. This winter, the eldest daughter, Damala, said to her father: "You should have a new winter coat made." The father said, "Don't make it, my coat can still be worn." The daughter said: "If you don't make one, none of us will make clothes anymore." So, the mother and daughters "forced" their father to go to the store together to buy a new coat.
    Rumanov never went to school when he was young. For thirty years, he has worked hard to learn and stay connected to production. He has grown from an ordinary apprentice to an excellent foreman. His salary has increased year by year. Yevdagiya is older and specializes in housework, so she no longer works. This year, Rumanov is already sixty years old. According to regulations, he can retire and receive a pension of 1,200 rubles per month. But he himself believes that since he still has the strength, why not participate in production! He requested to continue working. Now, he earns 3,000 rubles per month: 1,600 rubles in wages, 600 rubles in allowances for long service, and 800 rubles in bonuses. For a long time, Rumanov handed over all his monthly salary to Yevdagiya as soon as he received it. The hostess manages the entire family finances. Monthly expenses have a fixed plan: fifty rubles for three meals. Rumanov and his two daughters eat lunch in the cafeteria, five rubles per person per day. Other expenses include going to the theater or movies every week; entertaining guests during the New Year and holidays, etc. For items exceeding 1,000 rubles, the whole family must discuss and decide.
      "For example, that wardrobe!" Rumanov turned and opened the closet door and said: "It has been used for more than twenty years. Now, the family's clothes have increased. We have decided to add a new wardrobe."
    Light footsteps came from the hallway, and a young girl walked in. She first scanned us with a surprised look, and then asked how we were doing affectionately.
      "This is the eldest daughter, Damala." Rumanov introduced: "She graduated from university three years ago and now works in the court mediation committee."
    "At home, she also helps me with housework. Cleaning the house, mopping the floor, washing clothes, cooking... she does everything." Yevdagiya said happily: "Girls must not only know how to work, but also learn how to manage housework, otherwise, they will suffer for a lifetime."
      "How do you manage your monthly salary?" I asked her.
      "A monthly salary of nine hundred rubles. Like my father: I hand it over to my mother as soon as I receive it."
    "That's in name only. I never use her money." Yevdagiya retorted: "She puts her monthly salary in the cabinet and then says to me:
  "I have put the money in the old place for you." As for me, I just look at it and don't touch it. Girls have great use for money, sisters go to movies, buy perfume, headscarves, etc.!"
    At this time, Rumanov suggested that I visit Damala's bedroom.
    This was a spacious room, decorated very elegantly and neatly. A beautiful wooden bed was covered with an orange-yellow silk sheet. Opposite the bed, a desk was placed by the window. Exquisite curtains hung on the window. On the right, against the wall, stood a large glass bookcase filled with various books. "Great Encyclopedia",
  "Complete Works of Lenin", as well as the complete works of Pushkin, Chekhov, Jack London, and others. Various cosmetics were neatly arranged on the dressing table with a large mirror. There were also four small peacocks made of silk velvet, made in China.
    When we came out of Damala's bedroom and returned to the guest room, the round table was already filled with tall wine glasses and teacups, as well as large and small plates containing sausages, ham, smoked fish, butter, etc. When the host poured wine for the guests, his own glass was empty. He said apologetically: "I really can't drink alcohol." This is very rare in the Soviet Union.
      "He doesn't smoke or drink alcohol in his life." The hostess explained: "Now, if he drinks a sip of alcohol, he feels uncomfortable."
    Damala added dishes for us unhurriedly. Yevdagiya brought over a tall plate of jam, the crimson jam was so full that it was about to overflow.
      "This is something from our hometown, please eat it! Don't be polite."
    "Why do you call it your hometown?" I asked.
      "You don't know yet," Rumanov said with a smile as if he had just discovered a secret: "We never go to the market to buy potatoes, cabbage, or jam all year round. In the Balashava district, forty kilometers away from Moscow, we have a villa, and there are some open spaces around the villa, where we plant fruit trees and various vegetables. In the summer, the hostess spends most of her time cultivating there. On Sundays, we take the car together to farm. This kind of labor life makes us feel very happy spiritually."
    My visit was coming to an end. Rumanov finally said to me: When you write an article, be sure to write these few sentences: Our family life practices strict frugality, not because we don't have enough money. Hard work and frugality are the basic guarantee of our prosperous life. Saving is only to make life better in a planned way. Hard work and frugality are also the virtues of a socialist family.
    At eleven o'clock at night, I bid farewell to Rumanov's home. On the way, I calculated: The Rumanov family's monthly income is nearly four thousand rubles, and after the expenses of daily life, there are probably one thousand five hundred to one thousand seven hundred rubles of savings each month. For the past one or two decades, the Rumanov family has never borrowed money once because they planned well. The family always has a lot of savings month by month and year by year. These savings are all stored in the bank and government bonds are purchased. Not long ago, Rumanov bought another 2,500 rubles of government bonds.
    I have seen many Soviet workers' families, many of whom have less income than the Rumanov family, and their family life is as good as the Rumanov family's because of hard work and thrift.

    鲁马诺夫一家
    戴枫
    在莫斯科“镰刀和锤子”炼钢厂党委书记办公室里，党委副书记柴洛夫向我介绍了老工长依万·米哈依洛维奇·鲁马诺夫。我打算到他家里去拜访他。
    这是一个傍晚，我穿过红场，沿着解冻的莫斯科河河畔大街走向鲁马诺夫的住宅。在珈契林奇岸边的一座七层楼的三层楼上，我找到了鲁马诺夫的家。主人热情地迎接了我。他身材矮小，但很健壮，稀疏的头发已微微发白。从他那身褪了色的工作服上，可以看出他是在忙着帮助做家务事哩！
    鲁马诺夫领我穿过窄长的走廊，进入客室。这里跟我常见的莫斯科人的一般客室一样，舒适而整洁。房间正中有一张圆桌，铺着紫红色的丝绒桌布。四周三把半新的靠背皮椅。一个两节的玻璃餐橱紧靠在左边墙上。透过明亮的玻璃，可以看见里面摆着各式各样玻璃的和瓷的器皿。靠右手墙角里立着一个深褐色的衣橱。窗前有一架小电视机，旁边是一个长沙发，蒙着洁白的沙发套。
    我们刚围着桌子坐下，鲁马诺夫的妻子叶夫达吉雅·依万诺夫娜走了进来。她身材不高，举止稳重，是家庭主妇的一般打扮：粗布的褪了色的连裙衫，外面罩着一个白色围裙。
    女主人微笑着说：“看看我们现在住得多宽敞；客室，两个卧室，厨房，差不多应有尽有了。”
      “现在的生活，你已经看到了。”鲁马诺夫接着说：“不过，现在的富裕生活，也是一年年逐步改善成这个样子的。”
    鲁马诺夫全家四口人，他们有两个女儿：已经工作的达玛拉和正在钢铁学院学习的珈丽。鲁马诺夫是贫农出身，十四岁时，为了不被饥饿折磨死，父亲和母亲送他到彼得堡去当徒工。十月革命时，他先被抓去当白军，之后，转入红军队伍。胜利后，退役下来，来到莫斯科。1923年进入“镰刀和锤子”炼钢厂当徒工。
      “我记得很清楚，”鲁马诺夫回忆着说：“革命胜利后的开初几年里，我们的生活虽说比以前过得好些，但还是很困难。那时，我刚和叶夫达吉雅结婚，两人都做工，每月工资刚够维持生活。每逢添置件把新衣或新家具，多少还得借点债。”
    “早先，我们住的房间只有十多平方公尺，房间里除了一张床之外，很少有其他家具了。”叶夫达吉雅插进来说：“饭菜和日用品花的钱，我们都计算得好好的，能节省的就节省，连一个戈比也不敢浪费。”
    鲁马诺夫趁我跟主妇谈话的时候，出去了一下。回来时，他穿的工作服已换成了深灰色夹白线的西装。条子绸衬衣上结着一条素色的领带。我的目光不由地落到他的西装上。
    鲁马诺夫说：“这套衣服，虽然穿了快十年了，还是挺新挺合身的。上工进厂我还舍不得穿它呢！”
    这时，主妇说起了一个故事：鲁马诺夫平日不仅用钱节省，而且非常爱惜衣服。他的冬大衣也有十年历史了。大衣的领口和袖口的绒毛都早磨得精光，但大衣面上还很好。今年冬天，大女儿达玛拉向父亲说：“应该给你做件新的冬大衣了。”父亲却说：“别做吧，我的大衣还能穿。”女儿说：“你不做，我们大家再也不做衣服了。”于是，母女三人“强逼”着父亲一起到商店买了一件新大衣。
    鲁马诺夫从小没有上过学。三十年来，他努力学习，不脱离生产。他从一个普通的徒工成长为优秀的工长。工资逐年增加了，叶夫达吉雅年纪已大，专管家事，也就不再做工了。今年，鲁马诺夫已经六十岁。按规定可以退休了，每月可以领取一千二百卢布的养老金。但他自己认为既然还有力气，为什么不参加生产呢！他要求继续工作。现在，他每月收入三千卢布：一千六百卢布工资，六百卢布由于工龄长而领到的津贴，八百卢布奖金。长时期来，鲁马诺夫每月一领到工资，就全数交给叶夫达吉雅。家庭经济管理全由主妇掌握。每月开支都有固定的计划：三顿饭菜五十卢布。鲁马诺夫和两个女儿中饭在食堂吃，每人每天五个卢布。其他，如规定每星期看戏或看电影；每逢过年过节请请客等。购置超过一千卢布的物品，一定要全家商量决定。
      “譬如说，那个衣橱吧！”鲁马诺夫转身拉开橱门说：“已使用了二十多年了。现在，全家衣服增多了。我们已决定添置一个新衣橱。”
    过道里传来了轻轻的脚步声，走进一位年青姑娘。她先用惊奇的目光向我们扫了一眼，然后就亲热地问起好来。
      “这就是大女儿达玛拉。”鲁马诺夫介绍说：“三年前大学毕业，现在在法院调停委员会工作。”
    “在家她还帮助我做家务事。打扫屋子，擦地板，洗衣，做饭……样样都做。”叶夫达吉雅高兴地说起来：“女孩子除了要会工作，还要学会管理家务，不然，将会一辈子吃苦头。”
      “你的每月工资是怎样支配的呢？”我问她。
      “每月九百卢布工资。跟父亲一样：领到了就交给母亲。”
    “这是名义上的。我是从来不动用她的钱的。”叶夫达吉雅反驳说：“她每月把领到的工资放在橱子里，然后向我说一声：
  “钱给你放在老地方了。”我呢，只是看看，并不去动它。女孩子的钱用场大，姐妹两人看电影，买香水、头巾啦！”
    这时，鲁马诺夫提议让我去参观一下达玛拉的卧房。
    这是一个宽敞的房间，布置得非常雅致整洁。漂亮的木床上蒙着橙黄色的绸被单。床对面靠窗放着一张书桌。窗上挂着精美的窗帘。右面靠墙立着一个大玻璃书橱，里面放着各式书籍。“大百科全书”、
  “列宁全集”，还有普希金、契诃夫、杰克·伦敦等人的全集。带有大镜子的梳妆台上整齐地摆着各种化妆品。还有四只中国出品的丝绒做成的小孔雀。
    当我们从达玛拉的卧房出来重新回到客室时，圆桌上已摆满了高脚酒杯和茶杯，还有盛着香肠、火腿、熏鱼、牛油等的大大小小的盘子。主人给客人酌酒时，自己的杯子却空着。他抱歉似地说：“实在不会喝酒。”这在苏联是很罕有的。
      “他一生不吸烟、不喝酒。”主妇解释说：“现在喝一口酒，就不舒服。”
    达玛拉不慌不忙地为我们添菜。叶夫达吉雅把一只盛着果酱的高脚盘子拿过来，紫红色的果酱满得都快溢出来了。
      “这是自己家乡的东西，请吃吧！别客气。”
    “为什么称它是家乡的呢？”我问。
      “你还不知道，”鲁马诺夫像刚发现秘密似地笑着说：“一年四季我们从不到市场上买土豆、白菜、果酱。在离莫斯科四十公里的巴拉沙瓦区里，有我们的一所别墅，别墅周围有些空地，我们在那里种了果树和各种蔬菜。夏天，主妇大部分时间在那里培种。星期日，我们一起乘车到那里去种地。这种劳动生活，使我们精神上非常愉快。”
    我的访问已接近尾声。鲁马诺夫最后对我说：当你写文章时一定要写上这几句话：我们的家庭生活厉行节约，并不是由于钱少不够用。勤劳节约是我们富裕生活的基本保障。节约只是为了有计划地使生活过得更好。勤劳节约也是社会主义家庭的美德。
    深夜十一时，我告别了鲁马诺夫的家。我在路上计算着：鲁马诺夫家的每月收入将近四千卢布，除日常生活的开支外，每月大概有一千五百到一千七百卢布的积蓄。一二十年来，鲁马诺夫家庭由于计划得好，从来没有借过一次债。家里总是逐月逐年有很多节余。这些节余都储蓄在银行里和买了公债。不久前，鲁马诺夫又买了二千五百卢布公债。
    我见过很多苏联工人家庭，其中很多比鲁马诺夫家庭收入少，他们的家庭生活都是和鲁马诺夫家一样由于勤俭过得很好。
