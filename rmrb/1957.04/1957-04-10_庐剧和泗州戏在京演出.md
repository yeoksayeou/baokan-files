    Lu Opera and Sizhou Opera Performed in Beijing

    (Our report) Lu Opera and Sizhou Opera, originating from both sides of the Huai River, have met with audiences in the capital.

    Lu Opera, formerly known as "Daoqi Opera," is one of the major local opera genres in Anhui Province. It is said that this opera genre may have a history of two hundred years. It is popular in the area north and south of the Huai River and on both sides of the Yangtze River, with a population of more than ten million people. Lu Opera has a simple and unadorned form, with a strong local flavor. The singing is bold, vigorous, and powerful, and it is good at conveying emotions. The repertoire mainly consists of excerpted plays and short plays, about 170 excerpts, and about 50 complete plays.

    Sizhou Opera, formerly known as "Lahunqiang," is the most popular opera genre in northern Anhui. It is said to have gradually developed from folk songs. Its main characteristics are: the singing is beautiful, melodious, and extremely infectious, and it can express the emotional changes deep within the characters' hearts. It and Lu Opera are a pair of sister flowers in Anhui opera genres. (Zhu Weifu)

    庐剧和泗州戏在京演出
    本报讯　来自淮河两岸的庐剧和泗州戏，在首都和观众见面了。
    庐剧原名“倒七戏”，是安徽省地方戏主要剧种之一。据说这个剧种可能有二百年的历史。它流行在淮河南北、长江两岸一千多万人口的地区。庐剧的形式纯朴、简单，有着浓厚的乡土色彩，唱腔粗犷、浑厚有力，善于传达感情。剧目以折戏、小戏较多，约一百七十余折，本戏约有五十余本。
    泗州戏原名“拉魂腔”，是安徽北部最流行的剧种。据说是由民歌逐步发展起来的。它的主要特点：唱腔幽美，委婉动听，有极大的感染力，能够把人物内心深处的感情变化表达出来。它和庐剧是安徽剧种中一对姊妹花。（朱维福）
