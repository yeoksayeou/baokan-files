Xinhua News Agency dispatch: According to reports, Saudi Arabia formally notified the United Nations on the 12th, opposing Israeli ships from using the Gulf of Aqaba.

    In a note to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, Saudi Arabian representative Hayari said that the Saudi Arabian government reminds member state governments that the Gulf of Aqaba "is under the sovereignty and jurisdiction of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This sea surface is Saudi Arabian territorial waters. These straits were, and still are, closed straits.”

    If the demands for free navigation of Israeli ships in this gulf are recognized, it "would only mean rewarding the aggressor and further exacerbating tensions in the Middle East."

    On the same day, the Saudi Arabian government notified governments of all countries that Saudi Arabia would not allow the establishment of Israeli rights to pass through the Gulf of Aqaba because the Gulf of Aqaba is within Saudi Arabian territorial waters.

    The note issued by the Saudi Arabian Embassy in Egypt stated that although Israel reluctantly withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip in accordance with UN resolutions, it has not abandoned its conspiracy of expansion and aggression. "One recent aspect of this conspiracy is Israel's claim that it has the right to pass through the Gulf of Aqaba; it has been trying desperately to establish this right since its aggression against Egypt."

    The note stated that the Gulf of Aqaba is a northwest extension of the Saudi Arabian Red Sea coastline. The Gulf of Aqaba is only nine miles wide, about twelve miles narrower than waterways recognized as international in nature under international law. Therefore, the Gulf of Aqaba "cannot be considered an open waterway; any attempt to make it international in nature would constitute an infringement on Saudi Arabian sovereignty and a threat to Saudi Arabian territorial integrity."

    Prior to this, in a note to all governments on March 31, the Saudi Arabian government also emphasized that the Gulf of Aqaba is a vital transportation route for Muslim pilgrims, and Saudi Arabia will definitely protect the pilgrimage routes within its territorial sovereignty.

    According to news from New York: Israeli Permanent Representative to the United Nations Eban held talks with Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on the 12th. After the meeting, Eban told reporters that they had discussed the issue of Saudi Arabia's opposition to Israeli ships freely passing through the Gulf of Aqaba. Eban threatened that despite Saudi Arabia's opposition, Israel still intends to exercise its so-called "right of innocent passage" in the Gulf of Aqaba.

    At the same time, U.S. State Department spokesman White reiterated to reporters that the United States still believes that the Gulf of Aqaba and the Straits of Tiran are international waters until the International Court of Justice makes a contrary decision.

    White also said that negotiations between the United States and Egypt on the Suez Canal issue have made little progress in the past two weeks. The negotiations are currently still ongoing in Cairo.

### 沙特阿拉伯不让以色列侵犯领海  美国和以色列仍扬言要闯过亚喀巴湾

    沙特阿拉伯不让以色列侵犯领海
    美国和以色列仍扬言要闯过亚喀巴湾
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：沙特阿拉伯12日正式通知联合国，反对让以色列船只使用亚喀巴湾。
    沙特阿拉伯代表哈雅尔在给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的照会中说，沙特阿拉伯政府提醒会员国政府注意，亚喀巴湾“是在沙特阿拉伯王国的主权和司法管辖之下的。这个海面是沙特阿拉伯的领海。这些海峡在过去和现在仍然是封闭的海峡。”
    如果承认以色列船只在这个海湾自由通航的要求的话，“只会意味着给侵略者酬报和使中东的紧张局势更加严重”。
    同一天沙特阿拉伯政府照会各国政府说，沙特阿拉伯不允许确立以色列通过亚喀巴湾的权利，因为亚喀巴湾属于沙特阿拉伯领海以内。
    沙特阿拉伯驻埃及大使馆发表的这份照会中说，虽然以色列根据联合国决议勉强撤出了西奈半岛和加沙地带，但是它并没有放弃扩张和侵略的阴谋。“这种阴谋最近的一个方面，就是以色列声称它有权通过亚喀巴湾；它从侵略埃及以来就一直在拼命设法确立这种权利。”
    照会说，亚喀巴湾是沙特阿拉伯红海海岸线在西北方面的延长。亚喀巴湾宽仅九英里，比根据国际法公认为具有国际性质的水道窄十二英里左右。因此，亚喀巴湾“不能认为是一条公开水道；任何使它具有国际性质的企图都将构成对沙特阿拉伯主权的侵犯，对沙特阿拉伯领土完整的威胁”。
    在这以前，沙特阿拉伯政府在3月31日向各国政府提出的照会中还强调说，亚喀巴湾是穆斯林朝圣交通要道，沙特阿拉伯一定会保护在它的领土主权范围以内的朝圣路线。
    另据纽约消息：以色列常驻联合国代表伊班12日同秘书长哈马舍尔德举行会谈。伊班在会谈后对记者说，他们曾经讨论沙特阿拉伯反对让以色列船只自由通过亚喀巴湾的问题。伊班扬言，尽管沙特阿拉伯反对，以色列仍然打算在亚喀巴湾行使所谓“无害通航的权利”。
    与此同时，美国国务院发言人怀特对新闻记者重申，在国际法院作出相反的决定以前，美国仍然认为亚喀巴湾和蒂朗海峡是公海。
    怀特还说，美国和埃及关于苏伊士运河问题的谈判在过去两星期中很少有进展。这个谈判目前仍旧在开罗进行。
