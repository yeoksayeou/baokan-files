Responding to the Call to Save Cotton Cloth

    Learning Tailoring Methods from Elderly Women
    Residents of Beijing's Shuimo Hutong Discuss Saving Cotton Cloth
    Hong Bingquan, director of the Shuimo Hutong Residents' Committee in Beijing's Dongdan District, convened a residents' forum (attended by twelve people, mostly young women and elderly women) on the afternoon of the same day after seeing the newspaper publish the State Council's decision to halve cotton cloth coupons. The following is a record of the main speeches:
    Wang Xu (mother of five children): I think it is the correct approach that the state has decided to halve the supply of cotton cloth because cotton production decreased last year.
    Will anyone have difficulties? Possibly, but these people are few, because most people have a surplus of cloth coupons every year. This also happened when cooking oil was first rationed; some people complained that it was not enough, but in the end it was enough. This shows that the flexibility of consumption levels is high, and the problem lies in proper arrangement. Besides, everyone has several sets of old clothes (I still have several sets of my wedding dresses in the box), so it is no problem to buy less cloth this year.
    Lei Yonglin (young woman): I think there is great potential for saving in clothing. Last year, the newspaper called on women comrades to make fancy clothes, but this year it is advocating hard work and plain living, so everyone is afraid to wear fancy clothes. In my opinion, these fancy clothes can still be worn; not wearing them is a waste!
    Miao Muzhen (elderly woman in her sixties): We old people are already very frugal in our clothing, and we need to be even more economical in the future.
    Mei Yongpei (middle-aged woman): I support the government's decision to halve the supply of cotton cloth. I will adhere to the spirit of thrift, wear old clothes as much as possible; give older children's clothes to younger children; and mend them when they are torn. In addition, I suggest that people with surplus cloth coupons can adjust them to those who lack them.
    Finally, everyone also unanimously agreed that elderly women are more economical in cutting clothes than young people (for example, to make a shirt, young people need six and a half feet of cloth, while elderly women only need six feet of cloth), so young people expressed that they would learn how to cut clothes from elderly women.

### 向老太太学习剪裁方法  北京水磨胡同居民座谈节约棉布问题

    向老太太学习剪裁方法
    北京水磨胡同居民座谈节约棉布问题
    北京东单区水磨胡同居民委员会主任洪炳泉大爷，看到报纸刊登国务院关于棉布票折半使用的决定后，在当天下午召开了居民座谈会（有十二人参加，其中大部分是青年妇女和老太太）。下面是主要发言的记录：
    王序（五个孩子的母亲）：我认为，去年棉花减产，国家采取折半供应棉布的决定是正确的做法。
    是否有人会发生困难呢？可能有，但是这些人很少，因为绝大部分人的布票每年都有剩余。这在食油开始定量供应时，也有些人吵着不够吃，结果也够吃了，这说明消费水平的伸缩性很大，问题在于安排得当。何况每个人都有几身旧衣服（我结婚时的花衣服还有好几套在箱子里），今年少买点布根本没有问题。
    雷永林（青年妇女）：在穿衣服上，可能节约的潜力很大。去年报纸号召女同志做花衣服，今年又提倡艰苦朴素，结果大家不敢穿花衣裳了。我看，这些花衣裳还是可以穿，不穿才是浪费呢！
    苗木珍（六十多岁的老太太）：我们老年人穿衣服本来就很节省，今后更需要节约了。
    梅永培（中年妇女）：我拥护政府折半供应棉布的决定。我将本着节约的精神，有旧的尽量穿旧的；大孩子的衣服尽量改给小孩穿；破了就补着穿。另外，我建议，布票有多余的人可以调剂给缺布票的人。
    最后大家还一致认为，老太太裁剪衣服要比年青人节省布（譬如做一件衬衣，年青人要六尺半布，老太太只要六尺布就够了），因此年青人表示要向老太太学习剪裁衣服的方法。（附图片）
