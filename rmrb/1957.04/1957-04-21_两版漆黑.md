    Two Pages of Darkness
    A local newspaper in Illinois, USA, ran a large advertisement on its first page, which read: If you want to know what the Secretary of Agriculture has done for the farmers, please read pages two and three. When the readers opened the paper, they found that pages two and three were two pages of darkness. It turned out that the newspaper wanted to tell its readers: the White House's agricultural policy has only given farmers a complete darkness.

    两版漆黑
    美国伊利诺斯州一家地方小报在它第一版上登了一个大广告，写道：谁想知道农业部长为农民做了些什么，请读第二版和第三版。当读者打开这份报时，却看到二、三版是两版漆黑。原来这家报纸是要告诉读者：白宫的农业政策所给农民的只是一团漆黑而已。
