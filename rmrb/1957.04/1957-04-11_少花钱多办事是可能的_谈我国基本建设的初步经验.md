It has been proven by the experience of compiling the 1957 basic construction investment plan that it is entirely possible to carry out more construction with less money and fewer materials, or in other words, to carry out more construction than in the past with the same amount of investment as in the past. After compression and adjustments, the new production capacity that major departments may increase in 1957 will not only not decrease, but will increase compared to the original higher investment plan. For example, the Ministry of Electric Power Industry can install 31,000 kilowatts more of power generation equipment; the Ministry of Coal Industry can add coal mining projects with an annual output of 6 million tons and coal washing projects with an annual output of 3 million tons; the Ministry of Chemical Industry has squeezed out some investment to accelerate the construction of fertilizer plants; the Ministry of Forestry Industry, after cutting 20 million yuan in investment, has squeezed out another 10 million yuan to subsidize local investment and increase the production capacity of raw timber by 1.4 million cubic meters per year. It can be seen that it is entirely possible to spend less and achieve more.

What is the basic experience here?

The basic experience lies in the fact that the development of our country's construction cause must be adapted to the basic characteristics of our country's economic development, that is to say, our country's construction must proceed from our country's specific conditions and must be based on facts. As everyone knows, our country is a country with a relatively backward economy, a large proportion of agriculture, a low level of technology, a large population, a rapid rate of increase, and a low standard of living for the people. However, in the past, due to our lack of construction experience and insufficient understanding of our country's economic strength, we overemphasized large-scale, modernization, mechanization, and high standards when determining construction projects in the past few years, while we did not give enough consideration to the characteristics of our country's economic backwardness, vast land, and large population. For example, factories occupy too much land, and the building area is often less than one-fifth of the land area, and the standards for non-productive construction are too high. In the basic construction investment of some production units, non-productive construction investment accounts for a large proportion; even in the construction and equipment standards of productive factory buildings and mines, there are problems of being too large and too high. When building steel plants, they always want millions of tons; when building coal mines, they also want nearly a million tons; when building power stations, regardless of whether it is in the south or the north, regardless of whether steam is needed or not, they all want to build thermal power stations; and they unilaterally pursue so-called "automation," and implement "automation" in some completely unimportant or even unnecessary places. For example, the window switches in some factories are automated, which is completely unnecessary under the current conditions. In urban construction, civil buildings, and other non-productive construction, too much consideration is given to the long-term, and not enough is combined with the current living conditions of the people in our country. For example, when building dormitories and hotels, we always pursue high-rise buildings and the "Beijing Hotel" standard, and are unwilling to consider ordinary bungalows and standards such as "Gaosheng Store" and "Yuelai Store." In the design and equipment supply of construction projects, too much emphasis is placed on foreign aid, and the spirit of self-reliance is not sufficiently expressed. This approach, on the one hand, caused some waste in financial and material resources, and was quite strenuous in terms of foreign exchange payments; at the same time, it prevented the country's limited funds from playing a greater role in a short period of time; on the other hand, it also affected the growth of our country's design and manufacturing forces, and affected the speed of our country's socialist industrialization. The situation mentioned above was difficult to avoid in the past period, when we still lacked the necessary experience. However, our country now has preliminary construction experience, our country has built and is building a number of large-scale, modern, and mechanized enterprises, and our country's design and manufacturing forces are also constantly growing. Under such conditions, it is possible and necessary to appropriately change the past situation.

The construction experience of the past few years has proven that it is completely necessary and correct to build a certain number of large-scale, modern, and mechanized enterprises. Such enterprises can not only provide our country with a large number of important products that ordinary medium-sized and small-sized enterprises cannot produce, but also greatly improve labor productivity and reduce costs. This is of decisive significance for our country's socialist industrialization and technological transformation. Therefore, it cannot be said that the construction in the past was wrong, or that much of it was wrong. On the contrary, the construction in the past has achieved great results, and we should feel encouraged and excited about the construction achievements in the past. Anyone who does not see this is of course wrong. However, we should learn from the construction of the past. The construction experience also proves that not all large-scale, modern, and mechanized enterprises are the most economical. In coordination with the construction of large-scale, modern, and mechanized enterprises, the planned and large-scale development of medium-sized, small-sized, and lower-technical-standard enterprises is not only necessary but also economical for our country's socialist industrialization. For example, the investment required per ton of designed production capacity for the construction of a coal mine with an annual output of 150,000 tons is only 20.9 yuan, and it can be put into production within one and a half years, and the entire designed production capacity can be realized within four years; if a coal mine with an annual output of 900,000 tons is built, the investment required per ton of designed production capacity is 49.1 yuan, and it will take three and a half to four years to start production, and seven or eight years to realize the entire designed production capacity. The construction of steel enterprises is also the same. The construction of a steel plant with an annual output of 1.5 million tons requires an investment of 1.2 to 1.5 billion yuan, and it takes about nine years from design to completion of construction. Pig iron can only be produced in the sixth year of construction. If the same amount of funds is used to build steel enterprises with an annual output of about 160,000 tons, 11 to 13 plants can be built. Each plant takes only about four years from design to completion of construction, and pig iron can be produced in the third year of construction. The medium-sized and small-sized enterprises listed here, as well as the medium-sized and small-sized enterprises in other departments, are all enterprises that we can design ourselves, and can also basically manufacture the equipment they need themselves. Therefore, the construction of medium-sized, small-sized, and lower-technical-standard enterprises can not only achieve the effect of increasing output and speeding up the construction progress, but also achieve the effects of strengthening technical forces and saving foreign exchange.

Therefore, it is necessary to resolutely implement the spirit of the resolution of the political report of the Eighth National Congress of the Party. When determining construction projects, in addition to those that must adopt large-scale, modern, and mechanized ones, medium-sized and small-sized ones should be adopted as much as possible, so that large-scale enterprises and small-sized and medium-sized enterprises are combined, new enterprises are combined with the expansion and renovation of existing enterprises, and mechanization is combined with manual operation. At the same time, in terms of urban construction and non-productive construction, standards should be appropriately lowered, and more consideration should be given to the current living standards of the people in our country. In this way, in terms of design and equipment supply, we can focus on self-design and self-manufacturing, supplemented by seeking foreign aid. Taking this measure can not only better combine our country's construction with our country's actual situation, so as to avoid waste of material resources, human resources, foreign exchange, etc.; but also accelerate the growth of our country's independent design and independent manufacturing capabilities, better meet our country's needs, and accelerate the speed of our country's socialist industrialization.

When compiling the 1957 basic construction plan, some departments, due to paying attention to the above-mentioned experiences, appropriately lowered the design standards while ensuring the original design effectiveness and ensuring the quality of the project, which saved 10%-15% of the basic construction investment. Some departments, under the condition of ensuring the combination of "bones" and "muscles," that is to say, under the condition of ensuring the correct proportion of investment in the construction of key enterprises and investment in service and auxiliary construction, have conscientiously reduced non-productive construction investment and increased productive construction investment, which is also a great saving (the central 14 industrial departments alone have saved more than 300 million yuan in investment due to the reduction of non-productive construction such as offices and schools). Some departments have also achieved the effect of spending less and achieving more by tightening up non-urgent projects and increasing urgent projects. Although these are still some preliminary effects of implementing the above-mentioned measures, these experiences are very valuable and worthy of attention and promotion by all departments.

    少花钱多办事是可能的
    ——谈我国基本建设的初步经验——
    编制1957年基本建设投资计划的经验证明，以较少的钱和较少的物资，搞更多的建设，或者说，拿同过去相等的投资，搞比过去更多的建设，是完全可能的。1957年的基本建设投资经过压缩和调整之后，主要部门可能增加的新的生产能力，不仅没有减少，反而比原定的较高的投资方案增加了。例如，电力工业部可以多装三万一千瓩的发电设备；煤炭工业部可以增列年产六百万吨的采煤工程项目和年产三百万吨的洗煤工程项目；化学工业部挤出了一些投资，加速了肥料厂的建设；森林工业部在削减二千万元投资后，还挤出一千万元，补助地方投资，增加年产原木一百四十万立方公尺的生产能力。可见，少花钱多办事是完全可能的。
    这里，基本的经验是什么呢？
    基本的经验就在于：我国的建设事业的发展，必须和我国经济发展的基本特点相适应，也就是说，我国的建设要从我国的具体情况出发，必须是实事求是的。大家知道，我国是一个经济比较落后，农业比重很大，技术水平很低，而人口众多、增殖率又快，人民生活水平较低的国家。但是，过去由于我们缺乏建设的经验，并且对于我国的经济实力了解不够清楚，因而在前几年确定建设项目的时候，过多地强调了大规模、现代化、机械化和高标准，而对于我国经济落后、地广人众的特点则考虑不够。比如，工厂占地面积过大，建筑面积常常不到用地面积的五分之一，非生产性的建设标准过高。某些生产单位的基本建设投资中，非生产性的建设投资占了很大的比重；就是在生产性的厂房、矿场的建筑和设备标准方面，也有偏大偏高的毛病。建设钢铁厂，总是要几百万吨的；建设煤矿，也是要近百万吨的；建设电站，不论南方或北方，不论需要和不需要蒸汽，都要搞热电站；而且片面追求所谓“自动化”，在一些完全不重要甚至根本不需要自动化的地方，也实行“自动化”。如有些工厂的窗户开关都实行了自动化，这在目前条件下就是完全不需要的。在城市建设、民用建筑和其它非生产性建设上，也过多地考虑了远景，而对于目前我国人民生活条件，则结合不够，比如在建筑宿舍和旅馆的时候，总是追求高层建筑和“北京饭店”标准，而不愿意考虑普通平房和“高升店”“悦来店”之类的标准。在建设项目的设计和设备供应上，则过多地强调了外援，而自力更生的精神则表现不足。这种做法，一方面在财力、物力上造成了一些浪费，在外汇的支付上相当吃力，同时，使国家有限的资金，不能在短时期内发挥更大的效果；另一方面也影响了我国设计力量和制造力量的成长，影响我国社会主义工业化的速度。上面所说的情形，在过去一个时期内，在我们还缺乏必要的经验的条件下，是很难避免的。但是，我国现在已经有了初步的建设的经验，我国已经建设了和正在建设着一批大型的、现代化、机械化的企业，我国的设计力量和制造力量也在不断地成长，在这样的条件之下，就有可能也有必要适当地改变过去的状况了。
    过去几年的建设经验证明，建设一定数量的大型的、现代化、机械化的企业，是完全必要的和正确的。这种企业，不仅能够给我国提供一般中、小型企业所不能生产的大量重要的产品；而且能够大大地提高劳动生产率和降低成本。这对于我国社会主义工业化和技术改造有着决定的意义。所以，不能说过去的建设是错了，或者说有不少是错了，恰恰相反，过去的建设是有很大的成绩，我们应该对过去的建设成就感到鼓舞和兴奋。谁要看不到这一点，那当然是错误的。但是，我们应该从过去的建设中间吸取经验，建设的经验同时证明，并不是所有大型的、现代化、机械化的企业都是最经济的。和大型的、现代化、机械化的企业的建设相配合，有计划地、大量地发展中、小型的，技术标准较低的企业，对于我国社会主义工业化，不仅是必须的，而且是经济的。例如，建设一个年产十五万吨煤炭的矿井，每吨设计生产能力所需的投资只要二十点九元，而且在一年半之内即可投入生产，在四年之内即可实现全部设计的生产能力；如果建设一个年产九十万吨煤炭的矿井，每吨设计生产能力所需的投资就要四十九点一元，而且必须到三年半至四年才能开始投入生产，到七年或者八年才能实现全部设计的生产能力。钢铁企业的建设也是这样。建设一个年产一百五十万吨的钢铁厂，需要投资十二至十五亿元，从设计到建设完成约需九年时间，在建设的第六个年头才能开始生产生铁。如果用同等数量的资金，建设年产十六万吨左右的钢铁的企业，则可以建设十一至十三个厂，每个厂从设计到建设完成只要四年左右的时间，在建设的第三年即可生产生铁。这里所列举的中、小型企业，以及其它部门的中、小型企业，都是我们自己能够进行设计的，同时也能够基本上由自己制造它所需要的设备。因此，建设中、小型的和技术标准较低的企业，既可以收到增加产量、加快建设进度的效果，又可以收到壮大技术力量和节约外汇等等效果。
    因此，必须坚决贯彻党的第八次全国代表大会关于政治报告的决议的精神，在确定建设项目的时候，除了那些必须采用大型的、近代化、机械化的以外，应该尽可能采用中型的和小型的，使大型的和中小型的企业相结合，使新建企业和原有企业的扩建改建相结合，使机械化和手工操作相结合。同时，在城市建设和非生产性的建设方面，则应该适当地降低标准，更多地考虑我国人民当前的生活水平。这样，在设计和设备的供应上，也就可以以自力设计、自力制造为主，以争取外援为辅。采取这种措施，不仅可以使我国的建设同我国的实际情况更好地结合，从而避免物力、人力、外汇等方面的浪费；而且可以加速我国独立设计和独立制造能力的成长，更好地满足我国的需要，加速我国社会主义工业化的速度。
    在编制1957年基本建设计划的时候，有些部门由于注意了上述的经验，因此在保证原定的设计效能，保证工程质量的条件之下，适当地降低设计标准，即节约了基本建设投资10％—15％。有些部门，在保证“骨头”和“肌肉”相结合的条件下，就是说，在保证重点企业建设的投资和服务性、辅助性等建设投资的正确比例的条件下，认真削减了非生产性的建设投资和增加了生产性的建设投资，也是很大的节约（仅中央十四个工业部门由于削减了办公室、学校等非生产性建设，即节约了投资三亿余元）。有些部门，由于紧缩了非急需的项目而增加了急需的项目，也收到少花钱多办事的效果。虽然，这还是执行上述措施的一些初步的效果，但是这些经验是很宝贵的，值得各部门重视和推广。
