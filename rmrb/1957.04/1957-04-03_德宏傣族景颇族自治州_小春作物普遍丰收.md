Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, April 1st: The more than 400 agricultural cooperatives experimentally established in the border ethnic regions of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province last year have achieved a universal bumper harvest of spring crops this year. Currently, the cooperatives are harvesting tens of thousands of mu of broad beans, peas, and wheat.

Originally, the majority of Dai and Jingpo farmers in the Dehong area did not have the habit of planting spring crops. After the autumn harvest last year, under the guidance of cadres, the cooperatives led other farmers to universally experiment with and expand the planting of spring crops. In the dam area of Longchuan County, where spring crops had never been planted before, Dai agricultural cooperatives experimented with planting broad beans and peas. The multiple cropping index of spring crops in the Qiliang Agricultural Cooperative of Ruili County has reached 70% of the cooperative's arable land area.

With the bumper harvest of spring crops, the income of agricultural cooperative members has also increased significantly. It is estimated that the agricultural cooperatives experimentally established in the Dehong border region will increase their income by more than 100,000 yuan. The Fengping Agricultural Cooperative, located next to the Yunnan-Burma Highway, has an average income of about 60 yuan per household from spring crops, which is equivalent to about one-tenth of the average rice income per household last year.

    德宏傣族景颇族自治州
    小春作物普遍丰收
    新华社昆明1日电　云南省德宏傣族景颇族自治州边沿民族地区去年试办的四百多个农业社，今年小春作物普遍丰收。目前各社正在收割数万亩蚕豆、豌豆和小麦。
    原来，德宏地区的傣族和景颇族农民，大部分没有种植小春作物的习惯。去年秋收后，各社在干部的指导下，带动其他农民普遍试种和扩种了小春作物。从来没有种过小春作物的陇川县坝区，傣族农业社试种了蚕豆和豌豆。瑞丽县旗亮农业社小春作物的复种指数已达到社内耕地面积的70％。
    随着小春作物的丰收，农业社社员的收入也有了较多的增加。估计德宏边沿地区试办的农业社将增加十多万元的收入。滇缅公路旁的风平农业社平均每户有六十元左右的小春作物的收入，相当于去年每户稻谷平均收入的十分之一左右。
