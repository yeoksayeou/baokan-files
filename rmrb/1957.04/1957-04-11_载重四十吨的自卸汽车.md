    Forty-Ton Dump Truck

    The Minsk Automobile Plant in the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic of the Soviet Union recently manufactured a forty-ton dump truck. It is currently undergoing road tests and will soon be mass-produced.

    Currently, the "MA3-525" type dump truck with a load capacity of twenty-five tons is widely used in various construction sites and mines in the Soviet Union. It was manufactured by the Minsk Automobile Plant six years ago. The directives of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on the Sixth Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy of the Soviet Union for 1956-1960 stipulated the production of dump trucks with a load capacity of forty to fifty tons. Based on this directive, the Minsk Automobile Plant established a designer group headed by designer Kalmykov to start designing and trial-producing as a gift for the socialist competition to welcome the 40th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. Now, the newly designed forty-ton "MA3-530" dump truck has been successfully trial-produced.

    This new type of vehicle has twelve cylinders, an engine with 450 horsepower, and can travel at a speed of up to 30 kilometers per hour. This new type of vehicle is operated with a hydraulic booster, which can save the driver a lot of labor. The cab has special equipment that can keep warm in winter and ventilate and keep cool in summer. Although this car is very large, it is easy to operate and use.

    The picture below is a comparison of the medium-load "ЗЦС-150" type car with the "МАЗ-530" type dump truck. (Zhang) (Attached picture)

    载重四十吨的自卸汽车
    苏联白俄罗斯共和国明斯克汽车制造厂最近制成载重量四十吨的自卸汽车，现在正进行行车试验，不久即可大量生产。
    目前在苏联各工地和矿山广泛使用的是载重二十五吨的“MA3—525”型自卸汽车，这还是六年以前明斯克汽车制造厂制造的。苏联共产党第二十次代表大会关于1956—1960年苏联发展国民经济第六个五年计划的指示中曾规定要生产载重量为四十到五十吨的自卸汽车。明斯克汽车制造厂根据这个指示成立以设计师卡尔梅科夫为首的设计师组开始设计试制，以作为迎接伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年的社会主义竞赛的献礼。现在，新设计的载重四十吨的“MA3—530”型自卸汽车已经试制成功了。
    这种新型汽车有十二个汽缸，引擎有四百五十马力，每小时行驶速度可达三十公里。这种新型汽车是用水力扩大器来操纵的，这样可以使司机省很多劳力。驾驶室有特别装置，冬天可以保暖，夏天则可通风保持凉爽。这种汽车虽然很大，但操纵和使用都很简易。
    下面这张图片就是中等载重量的“ЗЦС—150”型汽车同“МАЗ—530”型自卸汽车的比较。　（章）（附图片）
