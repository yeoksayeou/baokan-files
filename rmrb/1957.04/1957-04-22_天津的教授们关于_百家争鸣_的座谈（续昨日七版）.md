Criticism and debate should start from a desire for unity, with mutual respect. Don't use classic works and labels to suppress people. It's not about making objective facts conform to classic works, but about integrating classic works with objective facts.

"Letting a hundred flowers bloom" is a means to develop science, and the ultimate goal is to resolve contradictions among the people and mobilize all forces to build socialism. "Letting a hundred flowers bloom" is a means of implementing the "unity—criticism—unity" policy. I believe that people's concerns about "letting a hundred flowers bloom" will decrease in the future, but they won't disappear quickly. To eliminate concerns, we should also mainly start from a desire for unity. The reason why so many concerns arose in the past is that they failed to fully start from this desire. When debates arise, people are afraid to confront each other, fearing that they won't be able to handle it. This concern is also due to a lack of a desire for unity. If we emphasize starting from a desire for unity in debates, and argue with anyone as if arguing with a good friend—arguing is inevitable, even fiercely, but still remaining good friends after the argument—then that would be good. Good friendship is a foundation for debate. Some people's criticisms now don't seem like they are arguing as or want to be good friends. If they started from the viewpoint of a good friend, they wouldn't make people unable to accept it. Currently, those with relatively high or self-proclaimed high levels of Marxism-Leninism, and those with relatively low or self-proclaimed low levels of Marxism-Leninism, both have concerns, feeling that arguing would be bad. Some people are afraid that reason cannot convince others, and that if they criticize others, they won't be convinced, so they put labels on people, acting arrogant. Those with lower levels are self-deprecating, afraid of losing face, and dare not speak, which is also a kind of arrogance. We sometimes see this situation in our school when discussing scientific papers within departments. Once, a young teaching assistant criticized an old teacher's scientific paper, saying it was worthless and not even a scientific paper. This was not being practical and realistic, nor was it criticizing from a desire for unity.

The concrete manifestation of a desire for unity lies in mutual respect and equality. It's not easy to get rid of the habit of intellectuals looking down on each other. There are still situations of mutual contempt. Some young comrades look down on the old, saying their knowledge is outdated and that debates are just for them to provide materials for the young to use. That is to say, you provide the materials, and I'll interpret them and draw conclusions. Some older comrades are self-deprecating: "Call me to provide materials, and I'll just provide materials!" without further research. We don't want this. We hope they will also present their own research. There are also some who believe that "letting a hundred flowers bloom" means the old ones are making a comeback and the old ways can be talked about again. They talk about the old ways not for science or socialist construction, but to be unconventional and create something new. If factionalism grows in "letting a hundred flowers bloom," that would be inappropriate. Of course, most comrades don't think that way. Currently, many people introduce idealism to make everyone understand what idealism is, not to promote it. Some people think that whoever introduces the old represents idealism and is here to fight against materialism. This view is inappropriate.

Therefore, we must first establish a desire for unity and vigorously promote a style of mutual respect. In teaching and research groups, everyone is a force that cannot be abandoned. We sometimes think that some teachers' ideas are incorrect and will take a long time to change, so we don't value their strength. This is wrong. We must respect everyone and strengthen unity with each other. Then "letting a hundred flowers bloom" will unfold. When discussing issues, some people analyze based on facts less and argue based on reason less, and instead use classic works and labels to suppress people more. This is a bit like dogmatism. Because it's not about making objective facts conform to classic works, but about integrating classic works with objective facts. Therefore, we must convince people with reason based on facts.

Research work should be coordinated and organized. Everyone should divide the work and research the same topic or separate topics. Education and psychology have many connections, and coordination is very important, but this is not done enough at present. The Academy of Sciences should not conduct research behind closed doors but should play a guiding and connecting role in scientific research throughout the country. For example, the issue of age characteristics in education and psychology is currently based on foreign materials, lacking comprehensive research on the development of Chinese children. In fact, many kindergartens and primary schools are keeping records, and many people are willing to conduct this survey and research work, but there is no unified leadership. For example, for surveys on children's height, weight, language, and painting development, it's best to have a unified plan, using the same steps, the same recording methods, recording units, and the same sorting methods. Everyone collects materials for research in different regions. The interpretation of results may differ, but it can play a significant role in widely accumulating comprehensive data.

Zheng Tianting
Historians hope to have access to more materials, hope newspapers will introduce more academic information, and hope the Academy of Sciences' Information Institute will expand its scope of work.

Over the past year, it can be said that the field of historical science has begun to "bloom." Many articles and People's Daily editorials have mentioned this. But in our view, the "blooming" is not enough compared to philosophy and literature. It's far behind. It can be said that there are still concerns. Saying there are concerns doesn't mean people are unwilling to accept Marxism-Leninism or afraid of being criticized. As far as I know, the few old teachers who are over sixty or seventy years old are willing to accept Marxism-Leninism. In the past, the methods of learning of some old teachers in the Chinese historical field were close to Marxism-Leninism, so it is easier to accept. The current concerns are mainly related to insufficient access to materials. Due to the nature of historical science, debate must be based on evidence, that is, historical data. Many experts have high demands on themselves. Without sufficient evidence, they are unwilling to easily express their opinions. There are few historical science reference books, and the historical data they have mastered is insufficient, so it's difficult to speak.

Historical workers all realize that they should "let go" and know that the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom" is long-term, but has it been completely "let go" in reality? Not yet. The problem lies in being too cautious in collecting and analyzing materials. Caution is good; only in this way can we eliminate one-sidedness. But if this continues for a long time, it will also affect the "letting a hundred flowers bloom." These two aspects should be given equal importance. On the one hand, we should encourage "letting go," and on the other hand, we should encourage learning—learning theory and learning professional skills, and mastering historical materials.

Therefore, we have a hope for the People's Daily. Currently, we need to know the market situation, know the progress of research work in various fields, and know what achievements and gains have been made in various fields. But it is impossible to understand these issues with one person's strength. Therefore, we hope that the People's Daily will undertake the work of introducing the situation. The People's Daily has made some introductions in this regard in the past, such as the introduction of the problem of periodization of ancient history, which has been of great help to us. Knowing the market situation, we can develop on the basis of existing research. In addition, we must also know the situation abroad, but we know too little now. Last year, we wanted to open a course on idealistic historiography, but it could not be opened because we did not understand the current research situation of bourgeois historiography. We hope that the People's Daily and other professional publications will do more introductions.

We are very willing to read the articles published on page seven of the People's Daily, but because the articles of the responsible comrades of the Central Committee are often published in the People's Daily, we also believe that all articles published in the People's Daily are summary articles. This creates two situations: one is to believe that what these articles say is correct, and the other is not to dare to write articles for the People's Daily. The emergence of this situation is also due to the fact that few discussion articles are published. If articles with different opinions can be published separately as soon as possible, everyone will know that these articles can be discussed.

In the past, various schools did a lot of data work, and it is best to find a way to exchange them. The Academy of Sciences' Information Institute only deals with natural sciences and not social sciences, which is very inconvenient for social science workers. We hope they can expand their scope of work and also grasp all the materials of each school.

For older comrades, delaying their research time due to administrative work is not only their personal loss, but also the loss of the country. Now, society's respect for experts is somewhat excessive: many things have to be found by experts, and experts cannot stand it. Now, experts are required to attend various meetings, and often the same problem has to be attended several times. In fact, some meetings only need them to attend one or convey to them, and they don't need to spend many days repeatedly participating in discussions. It is also worth considering how many people's opinions an expert can represent. In fact, they will not have any opinions if they do not participate. At present, it is indeed difficult to guarantee them five-sixths of the research time. The administration only manages one-sixth, and no one guarantees the five-sixths. This problem should be solved.

Mutual respect is also very important. In our school, we do not mention that young comrades should respect older comrades, and older comrades should also respect young comrades, but advocate respect for labor. Old teachers have labored for many years, of course, it is worth respecting; young comrades, although some are several generations of students of old teachers, their labor is also worth respecting.

I think there can also be debates in the classroom, but one should not only say their own opinions but also introduce the opinions of various schools. If one introduces the opinions of various schools and then talks about their own opinions, it can make it easier for students to accept and cultivate students' ability to think independently. We recently held a small seminar. The speeches were very enthusiastic every time, but they refused to write articles. How to encourage debate outside the classroom, just like in the classroom, is still a big problem.

I hope to be able to restore social science, political science and other disciplines. I hope to translate a large number of important works in the world.

The introduction of the "Letting a hundred flowers bloom" policy also has important significance internationally. Imperialists often say that we have no academic freedom and that intellectuals cannot speak and write freely, in an attempt to prevent our students from returning to China, especially students who study social sciences are more likely to be deceived by them. The "Letting a hundred flowers bloom" policy can inspire the enthusiasm and creativity of intellectuals on the one hand, and on the other hand, it can also show that only under the socialist system can the role of intellectuals be fully发挥. From the nature of our regime, it is inevitable to adopt this policy.

In the past, people who studied social sciences were hit to a certain extent in terms of mood after liberation, because certain departments were abolished after liberation, or did not become independent disciplines. The government has made certain arrangements for these people. In particular, many people who studied sociology, political science, and law in the past have switched jobs, and some have changed to administrative work. In the past, many courses were cancelled because the Soviet Union did not have them. Whether this approach is appropriate is worth reconsidering today. For example, sociology is a very broad field. After the departments were cancelled, many specialties were not taken care of, such as demography, ethnology, and social thought. There are many books on political science published abroad, which were all denied with the word "reactionary" in the past. Some books are about the study of bourgeois revolutions and are also considered reactionary. The study of the political situation, political system, international relations, international law, etc. of capitalist countries was originally the main course of the political science department, but it has not received due attention now. There are also many books on advanced ideas in capitalist countries, and it is also wrong to deny them all. Regarding bourgeois social science research, from the perspective of inheritance, we should inherit their useful aspects. We must regard world culture as a whole and greatly expand our field of knowledge. It is wrong to deny it all, to only criticize but not introduce.

Introduction and criticism are inseparable. Today's sorting out of the old things of the bourgeoisie is not for publicity and promotion. A friend of mine, when lecturing on Hegel's philosophy in university, was afraid that others would misunderstand that he was an idealist, so he declared in advance that the actor who plays a clown is not necessarily a bad person. Only criticizing but not introducing will only make people more and more confused in their understanding. Only by combining introduction and criticism can we make a correct estimate of bourgeois thought. In short, the introduction work should be bolder in the future, and do not put labels of "faction" and "element" on the introducer.

I hope that we can reconsider the restoration of certain abolished disciplines. The research on the research results of capitalist countries alone requires some people to do it. For example, Keynesian economics is about to become obsolete in the United States. If we only criticize some obsolete theories today, we will not keep up with the development of history.

The People's Daily should publish an editorial on these issues to point out the direction of research to social science workers and give them powerful inspiration.

The Academy of Sciences should give a clearer task to people who study old social sciences according to scientific planning, and tell them how to use past materials to better发挥 their original expertise. Now it still has the situation of doing each other.

We must expand the scope of translation work. At present, only attention is paid to the translation of Marxist-Leninist classics, and the translation of bourgeois classics is too little. This work is related to promoting "Letting a hundred flowers bloom". Although some comrades have a high level of Marxism-Leninism, they do not read the original when giving opinions, and can only raise some questions from the ideological level. For example, some people criticize Pound's jurisprudence, but they have not carefully read the original book at all, so the criticism is not pertinent and lacks persuasiveness. A large amount of introduction of important works in the world can expand our field of knowledge, introduce a rich cultural heritage to the younger generation, and is beneficial to the development of socialist culture. Recently, some people in the Soviet Union have denied that the United States has national culture. This view also exists in China. This is an attitude of wiping out everything and denying everything.

Lei Haizong
Social sciences need to develop continuously, but Marxism "is still stuck in 1895."

Insufficient materials make it impossible for many people to debate. Although there may be concerns about "Letting a hundred flowers bloom," there are not many people in the Tianjin history field who dare not debate because of concerns. The materials are too few to debate. We who study world history have fewer materials than other departments.

Social science (including history) has a fundamental problem: social science was produced with the emergence of capitalism and became a strict and true science in capitalist society; Marx and Engels established new social science for the proletariat on the basis of bourgeois social science with new methods and new viewpoints. This raises several questions. One is that Chinese social science did not have a capitalist stage, because China did not experience capitalism in history. Although it learned a little from foreign countries before liberation, it was very little and only for decoration. It did not learn thoroughly. There is no such thing in the social consciousness of Chinese people. Even if a few people have a relatively thorough contact with bourgeois social science, they are exposed to it when studying abroad, and they lag behind after returning to China and cannot connect. In the past, it was only for decoration. Today, we are required to inherit the cultural heritage of mankind in the past and develop new social science on this basis. It is impossible to do without studying these. From this point of view, the problem of data is even greater. Some people think that we have only been isolated from capitalist social science after liberation. In fact, we did not understand it thoroughly in the past, but today we are required to have more and more thorough understanding than before liberation.

In addition, on the view of the new social science established by Marx and Engels, everyone is theoretically consistent and admits that Marxism-Leninism should be developed, but in fact it has stopped developing and is still stuck in the place of Engels' death in 1895. After 1895, Lenin and Stalin had new statements on individual issues, but they mainly talked about current revolutionary issues. In terms of understanding and sorting out thousands of years of human historical experience and establishing new social science, it basically stayed in 1895. This is what dogmatists are like. Marx and Engels also often revised their theories during their lives. They paid attention to the development of each social science department at that time and grasped the materials and results of scientific research. However, later people believed that they had solved all the problems, and social science could no longer develop. In fact, this is not the case. After 1895, there were many new materials in social science, and there were many new understandings of old materials. Our task today is to make up for the sixty-two years from 1895 to today. This is not a problem for that individual, but a problem for the entire socialist camp. The work is very difficult. Before liberation, the capitalist social science was not fully grasped. Recently, some journals of capitalist countries have been newly ordered, and many problems are not understood. Some social scientists in capitalist countries are reactionary, such as Keynes, who serve imperialism, but today there are also many social scientists in capitalist countries who do not intentionally serve imperialism. Some are just a matter of understanding and do not directly involve positions, but only different analyses and researches on materials. Of course, after analysis, any social scientist has a position. In addition, historical issues, such as Greek history, have discovered a lot of materials in the past sixty-two years. The Athenian Constitution discovered in Egypt in 1890 can explain many problems. Engels did not see this book. If he had seen it, he would have different statements on some issues in his book "The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State". Social science needs to develop continuously: everyone says this in theory, but in practice they think that social science has stayed in 1895.

Mr. Zheng Tianting and I do not write articles mainly because there is not enough material. Many things I learned in the past are not useful now. Things that are useful today were not learned in the past and need to be learned from scratch. In the past, we bought a lot of books from capitalist countries, but we did not buy useful books. In particular, there is a lack of books on world history. At present, our library wants to buy books, but the funding is limited.

For older people, they have decades of habits. When studying a problem, they have to master comprehensive or relatively comprehensive materials before they can speak. Today, there are many issues worth talking about, but there is no way to talk about them without mastering the materials. Therefore, it is difficult to conduct research without buying a large number of books that were not bought in the past. We must understand the methods of studying problems by Marx and Engels, rather than just揣摩 their conclusions. Marx and Engels made conclusions by mastering the materials sixty-two years ago. If they had mastered today's materials, they would have made other conclusions. If we use the conclusions made by Marx and Engels when studying Greek history sixty-two years ago to solve the problems of ancient Chinese history, of course, this will not solve the problem, but will only make the problem more and more confusing.

Editor's note: Mr. Lei believes that social science needs to develop continuously, and in order to develop social science, it is necessary to oppose dogmatism. This opinion is undoubtedly correct. But Mr. Lei believes that Lenin only made "new statements on individual issues" to Marxism, and Marxism "basically stayed in 1895," which violates the facts. Marxist social science refers to the basic theory of Marxist on social development, not individual conclusions on individual facts. It was precisely in a series of basic theories of social science, first of all, in the basic theories on imperialism, on proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship, and on socialist construction, that Lenin developed Marxism. Without these developments and without the struggle against the opportunism of the Second International, there would be no October Revolution and socialist Soviet Union. Communist parties of various countries have also made their contributions to the development of Marxism. Our Chinese Communists have combined the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, overcame right-wing and "left-wing" opportunism, and also made Marxism-Leninism get new development, so that we can realize the democratic revolution and socialist revolution in China. These are all well known. And Mr. Lei's remarks about the discovery of ancient history in the past sixty-two years only involve individual conclusions in the works of Marx and Engels. Researchers of ancient history should of course supplement and even revise those individual conclusions according to the newly discovered facts, but supplementing and revising these individual conclusions does not affect the basic theory of Marxism. This is our view, and we hope everyone will discuss it.

Bao Juemin
Different opinions should be resolved on the basis of persuasion and discussion, and avoid casually putting labels on people.

In the past few years, especially since 1952, everyone has indeed had some concerns about writing articles and speaking. There are many reasons for this. Some comrades, as Chairman Mao pointed out, want to use crude and simple methods to solve ideological problems. I study economic geography, but I am worried about being labeled with the "geographical environment determinism" label. For example, after liberation, everyone unanimously requested to learn from the advanced science and experience of the Soviet Union, which is good, but at that time, it was bound by some dogmas. There were some problems that were not very convincing to me, but I had to reluctantly accept them completely. For example, the Soviet textbooks contained materials criticizing certain German bourgeois geographers before the October Revolution. This was written for the Soviet situation and was not completely combined with the Chinese reality. However, I was afraid that if I talked more based on my country's situation, I would go astray and make mistakes. This certainly affected the improvement of teaching quality, and there was no "Letting a hundred flowers bloom" in academic thought. This is one aspect. At the same time, the old things in business cannot be said, the new ones cannot be done, and the western academic circles for nearly 20 years since the War of Resistance Against Japan are not very understood, forming a situation of not being able to pass on and being empty and bewildered. Of course, it is impossible to have a dispute. However, in the past year or so, this situation has changed a lot. For myself, the academic discussion meeting of the Chinese Geographical Society last summer and the academic problem dispute situations frequently reported in newspapers and periodicals, especially after the vivid education I received at the recent propaganda work conference of the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee, have made my ideological understanding also change; at present, my concerns have basically been eliminated, and I am only thinking about how to actively create conditions to participate in the ranks of "Letting a hundred flowers bloom".

In the process of arguing, I think there are several points worth noting: First, different opinions should be resolved on the basis of persuasion and discussion, and try to avoid putting labels on people. Of course, on a national scale, the phenomenon of putting labels on people is very rare, but if it is specific to a small unit such as a teaching and research office or a research group, it cannot be said that it has completely disappeared. Second, the promotion of "Letting a hundred flowers bloom" and academic work is a long-term task, and we must prevent impatience. Third, the garden for arguing should be expanded, and academic groups such as societies can be used as much as possible to carry out arguments. Fourth, I hope to increase the reporting of academic trends in some newspapers of national significance (such as the People's Daily and Guangming, Wenhui, etc.), so that everyone can be inspired in time and can also play an encouraging role.

Zhang Hengshou
Criticism should create a new style that starts from a desire for unity.

Regarding "Letting a hundred flowers bloom", there is a new concern now, which is that I am afraid that I will not argue well and will not meet the requirements, so I am overcautious. We should speak out if we have opinions.

Secondly, there are also views that do not actively encourage "Letting a hundred flowers bloom". For example, Chen Qitong and others' estimation of literary and artistic issues is only to see the bad aspects and not the good aspects. This situation also exists in schools. Some people say that after the call to march towards science, many teachers do not pay attention to teaching work, which is not in line with the facts. From the perspective of our school, most teachers are still focused on teaching work. This statement is also influenced by the view that does not approve of "Letting a hundred flowers bloom".

Correct things are produced in the struggle with wrong things. If Marxism-Leninism is to develop, it must go through the struggle with wrong things. Negative things sometimes give people certain inspiration, and idealism can inspire us in some aspects. The attitude of criticism must start from a desire for unity. Many people write critical articles and learn the writing style of Marxist-Leninist classical writers, but the criticism of classical writers is mostly against enemies. We seem to create a style that makes critical articles both humorous and easy to accept.

Some of the dogmatism in history and philosophy is not a matter of mastering the amount of materials. For example, everyone has mastered almost the same materials on ancient Chinese history, and the problem is mainly in the method of analysis and research. If the older generation of experts learns more theory and writes more articles that combine theory with practice, they can set an example for young comrades and overcome the dogmatism of young comrades. If we want to change dogmatism in philosophical research, we should advocate combining in-depth analysis and the study of history.

Ji Taoda
Research on economics should start from the reality of China, not from concepts.

I think the introduction of the "Letting a hundred flowers bloom" policy is an ideological liberation, a ideological liberation for socialist construction. This policy is put forward according to the specific conditions of our country, not for international propaganda as some people say. Secondly, the so-called argument is of course not a random argument. Since it is not a random argument, there should be a central guiding ideology, and this guiding ideology is Marxism-Leninism. Speaking of hundreds of schools, which schools are they? If we talk about hundreds of schools, if we talk about academic systems, there are actually more than hundreds of schools. But in terms of philosophy, it is only two schools, namely idealism and materialism. However, materialism has both true and false, and it is only through arguing among hundreds of schools that we can know who is true and who is false. Therefore, I think there is no problem of放 and收 at present.

After the introduction of the "Letting a hundred flowers bloom" policy, there are many articles on arguing. From the perspective of economics, it has also received great results. Some problems that were not raised before are now being raised. For example, we are now discussing the term "socialist commodities". However, Stalin's statement on commodities was made under the conditions that the Soviet Union had already built socialism, while our conditions today are different from those of the Soviet Union. After "Letting a hundred flowers bloom", there are indeed many articles, and I have not read many of these articles, but judging from the articles I have read, I feel that there is such a shortcoming: many articles start from concepts, not from the reality of China. For example, the study of the law of value and its role under socialist economic conditions is an extremely important issue. Soviet professor С．Г．СТРУМИЛИН院士, who is 80 years old this year, noticed this problem a long time ago and made important contributions, but even today, the Soviet Union has not completely solved this problem. After Stalin's last work "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR" was published, scholars in our country discussed this issue since 1953, and the discussion on this issue has become more lively since the "Letting a hundred flowers bloom" policy was put forward, which is more in-depth than the previous discussion. However, the connection with reality is still not close enough. Because these discussions are only based on other people's existing conclusions, not based on our specific situation and actual materials. Therefore, it is said that the common shortcoming now is the lack of actual materials. It would be best if scientific research can be combined with practice. For example, it would be good to conduct a survey on the free market in Tianjin. This is not only good for the handling and research of the free market in Tianjin, but also good for the study of the law of value.

Secondly, I think that although there are also arguments in economic theory, there are also many blank spots. Chairman Mao pointed out in his article "Reform Our Study" more than ten years ago that we only know foreign countries but do not know China, but some of the problems that he called on us to study at that time only started after the "Letting a hundred flowers bloom" policy was put forward. For example, the study of Chinese economic history and Chinese economic thought history are blank spots. The study of Chinese economic history started relatively early, and the prelude to the debate has been revealed. For example, various views have begun to be published on the issue of the origin of the Chinese capitalist mode of production. At present, there is no shadow of the history of Chinese economic thought, and the difficulty of book materials is even greater. Some of the books we know cannot be found. For example, I am now studying Wei Yuan's economic thought, but I cannot find four or five works about Wei Yuan. Some books are available in the library, but they cannot be found due to poor management.

In addition, how to use talents is also a problem. For example, few people have engaged in the history of Chinese economic thought before. Now that we are engaged in it, it is more necessary to carry out it in an organized manner.

The People's Daily has academic trends, which is very good. However, it is best to point out the direction of research in some trends so that people who study this science can save time and avoid detours. The shortcomings in the research can also be pointed out in the trends. (End)

    天津的教授们关于“百家争鸣”的座谈
    （续昨日七版）
    胡毅
    批评和争论要从团结的愿望出发，互相尊重，别拿经典著作和大帽子压人。不是要客观事实服从经典著作，而是要经典著作结合客观事实。
    百家争鸣是发展科学的一个手段，最终目的在于解决人民内部的矛盾，动员一切力量来建设社会主义。百家争鸣是执行“团结—批评—团结”的方针的一种手段。我相信今后大家对百家争鸣的顾虑会减少，但不见得会很快就全没有。要消除顾虑，也应主要地从团结的愿望出发。过去产生好多顾虑的原因，都是没有能完全从这个愿望出发。争鸣起来了，彼此不交锋，怕互相受不了：这种顾虑也是由于缺乏团结的愿望。如果我们在争论中，先强调从团结的愿望出发，和任何人争鸣，好像和好朋友吵架一样，吵是总得吵的，甚至吵得很凶，但吵完还是好朋友，那就好了。好朋友是争鸣的一个基础。现在有些人的批评，就不像是作为或想作为好朋友来争吵的，如果从好朋友的观点出发，就不会使人接受不了。现在马列主义水平比较高的或自命为水平比较高的，同马列主义水平比较差的，或自命为水平比较差的，两方面都有顾虑，觉得争起来不好。也有人怕理不能服人，怕批评了人家不服，就拿大帽子扣人，自高自大；水平差的人则自卑，怕丢脸，不敢说话，其实这也是一种自高自大。我们学校里有时在系内讨论科学论文时，也有这种情况。一次一个年青的助教对老教师的科学论文批评得一钱不值，说这简直不是科学论文。这就不是实事求是，也没有从团结的愿望出发来进行批评。
    具体表现团结的愿望就在互相尊重，互相平等。文人相轻的作风要去掉是不大容易的，目前还是有互相瞧不起的情况。年青的同志中还有人瞧不起老的，说他们的学问过时了，争鸣只是让他们提供材料给年青的利用。也就是说，你拿材料，我来解释，来作结论。年老的同志，有的自卑：叫我拿材料，我就供给材料罢！而不进一步进行研究。我们不希望这样，希望他们也拿出自己的研究来。也有一部分人却认为百家争鸣是旧的翻身了，过去的一套又可以讲了。他讲旧的不是为了科学，为了社会主义建设，而是想标新立异。如果在百家争鸣中滋长了门户之见，这是不合适的。当然大部分同志不是这样想。目前好多人介绍唯心主义，目的是使大家认清楚唯心主义是怎么回事，并不是为了推广它。有些人认为谁介绍旧的谁就代表唯心主义，就是来同唯物主义作斗争，这个看法是不妥当的。
    因此，先要树立团结的愿望，大力提倡互相尊重的作风。在教研组内，每个人都是不可被放弃的力量。我们有时认为某些先生的思想不正确，要等很长时间才能改变，不重视他们的力量。这是不对的。要尊重每一个人，彼此加强团结。这样百家争鸣就展开了。在讨论问题时也还有人从事实上分析少，据理争辩少，而多是用经典著作和大帽子压服人。这就有点像教条主义的做法。因为并不是要客观事实服从经典著作的，而是要经典著作结合客观事实。因此我们要根据事实，以理服人。
    研究工作应该协调组织，同一题目或分别题目，大家分工去研究。教育学和心理学有很多的联系，协调起来是很重要的；但目前这样做得不够。科学院不应关起门来研究，要对全国的科学研究起指导和联系的作用。例如教育学和心理学中的年龄特征问题，现在都是根据外国材料来讲，对中国儿童的发展情况缺乏全面研究。其实现在有好多幼儿园小学都在作记录，也有好多人愿意作这一调查研究工作，但是没有统一的领导。比方对于儿童身长体重、语言、书画能力发展的调查，顶好有统一的计划，用同一步骤，同一记录方法、记录单位，同一整理方法，大家在各地区分途收集材料进行研究。结果解释可以不同，但对广泛积累带全面性的资料上可起很大作用。

    历史学家希望掌握更多的资料，希望报纸多介绍学术情况，希望科学院情报所扩大工作范围。
    一年来，可以说历史科学界已经争鸣起来了。好多文章和人民日报的社论都提到这一点。但照我们的看法，鸣是鸣了，而比起哲学、文艺方面来说，鸣得还不够，差得很多。可以说还有顾虑。说有顾虑，倒不是不愿意接受马列主义，也不是怕受批评。据我知道，在六、七十岁以上的可数的几位老先生，都愿意接受马列主义。过去中国历史学界一些老先生的治学方法，多是接近马列主义的，接受起来比较容易。目前的顾虑主要是与掌握资料不够有关。由于历史科学的性质，争鸣就要有根据，即有史料。好多专家对自己要求高，没有足够的证据，不愿意轻易发表意见；历史科学工具书很少，靠自己掌握的史料又不够，不好说话。
    历史工作者都认识到应“放”，也知道百家争鸣的方针是长期的，但事实上是不是完全放了呢？还没有。问题就在于收集和分析材料方面过于谨慎。谨严是好的，只有这样才能消除片面性，但如果长久是这样，对百家争鸣也有影响。这两方面要并重，一方面要鼓励“放”，一方面要鼓励学习，学习理论和学习业务，掌握史料。
    这样，对人民日报就有一个希望。目前我们需要知道行情，知道各方面研究工作的进展情况，知道各方面有什么成绩和收获。可是要了解这些问题靠一个人的力量是不可能的，因此希望人民日报担负起介绍情况的工作来。人民日报过去在这方面也作过一些介绍，如关于古史分期问题的介绍，对我们的帮助就很大。知道行情，我们就可以在已有的研究基础上发展。另外，对于国外的情况，也须要知道，现在知道得太少。去年我们想开唯心主义历史学的课，但开不起来，因为对资产阶级历史学目前的研究情况不了解。我们希望人民日报和其他专业刊物多作些介绍工作。
    人民日报七版登的文章，我们很愿意看，但因为中央负责同志的文章经常登在人民日报上，我们也就认为凡在人民日报上发表的文章，都是总结性的文章。这就产生两种情况：一种是相信这些文章说的都没有错；一种是不敢给人民日报写文章。这种情况的产生，也由于讨论的文章登得少。如果能将不同意见的文章尽快的先后分别发表出来，大家就会知道这些文章原来是可以讨论的了。
    各个学校过去作了很多资料工作，最好能设法交流一下。科学院情报所只搞自然科学，不搞社会科学，这对社会科学工作者是非常不便的。希望他们能扩大工作范围，把每个学校所有的材料也掌握起来。
    对年老的同志来说，因搞行政工作而耽误他们的研究时间，不仅是他个人的损失，也可以说是国家的损失。现在社会上对专家的尊重有些过分：许多事情都要找专家，专家就受不了。现在各种会议都要专家们参加，往往同样问题的会要参加好几次，其实有些会议只要他们参加一个或对他们传达一下就可以了，不需要花很多天的工夫重复的参加讨论。一个专家他能代表多少人的意见也值得考虑；其实不参加他们也不会有意见。目前要保证他们有六分之五的研究时间，确实困难。行政上只管六分之一，六分之五就没有人保证了。这个问题应该设法解决。
    互相尊重也很重要。在我们学校，不提年青的同志要尊重年老的同志，年老的同志也要尊重年青的同志，而提倡尊重劳动。老先生劳动了多少年，当然值得尊重；年青的同志虽然有的是老先生们的几代学生，但他们的劳动也是值得尊重的。
    我认为课堂上也可以争鸣，但不应该只说自己的见解，不介绍各家的意见。如果介绍了各家的意见，再说自己的见解，可使学生容易接受，并培养学生独立思考的能力。我们最近搞了一个小型的讨论班，每次讨论时发言很热烈，但要他们写文章，就不肯了。如何鼓励课堂以外的争鸣，也像在课堂上一样，还是一个很大的问题。
    希望能够恢复社会学、政治学等学科。希望大量翻译世界重要著作。
    百家争鸣方针的提出，在国际上也有重要的意义。帝国主义者常说我们没有学术自由，知识分子不能自由讲话、写文章，企图阻挠我国留学生回国，尤其研究社会科学的留学生更容易受他们欺骗。百家争鸣的方针一方面可以启发知识分子的积极性和创造性，另一方面又可说明只有在社会主义制度下，知识分子的作用才得到充分的发挥。从我们政权的性质来说，采用这种方针也是必然的。
    过去研究社会科学的人，解放后在情绪上受到了一定的打击，因为某些科系解放后都被废除，或不成为独立的学科。政府对这些人作了一定的安排，尤其过去研究社会学、政治学和法律学的人很多都转业了，有的改作行政工作。过去好多课程因为苏联没有，都取消了。这种做法是否妥当，今天值得重新考虑。比如社会学这一门，范围就很广，科系取消后好多专业没有人管，如人口学、民族学、社会思想都没有人专门研究。外国出版的政治学的书籍相当多，过去都用“反动”一句话来否定。有些书是有关资产阶级革命的研究，也被认为是反动的。研究资本主义国家的政治情况、政治制度、国际关系、国际法等等本来都是政治学系的主要课程，但现在未受到应有的重视。研究资本主义国家的先进思想的书也很多，一概否定也是不对的。对资产阶级社会科学研究，从继承性的观点来看，继承它们的有用的一面。我们要把世界文化看作一个整体，应该把我们的知识领域大大的扩大，一概否定，只批评不介绍是不对的。
    介绍和批评是分不开的。今天整理资产阶级的旧东西，不是为了宣扬提倡。一位朋友在大学里讲黑格尔哲学时，恐怕别人误会他是唯心主义者，所以预先声明演花脸的演员本身不一定是坏人。只批评不介绍，只会使人在认识上愈搞愈乱。只有把介绍和批评互相结合，才能对资产阶级思想作正确的估计。总之，介绍工作以后还要放大胆，不要给介绍的人贴上什么“派别”什么“分子”的标籖。
    我希望：重新考虑恢复某些被废除的学科，单是研究资本主义国家的研究成果，也需要好一些人去做。譬如在美国，凯恩斯学说快要过时了，如果今天我们只批评些已过时的学说，就跟不上历史的发展。
    人民日报最好能就这些问题发表一篇社论，给社会科学工作者指出研究的方向，并予有力的启发。
    科学院应该对研究旧的社会科学的人，按照科学规划给以更明确的任务，告诉他们究竟如何利用过去的材料，更好地发挥原有的专长。现在多少还带有各搞各的情况。
    要扩大翻译工作范围。目前只注意翻译马列主义名著，对资产阶级的经典著作翻译显得太少，这个工作对推动百家争鸣有关系。有些同志马列主义水平虽高，给人提意见时不看原著，只能从思想上提些问题。比如有人批判庞德法学，他们根本没有细读原书，批评就不中肯，就缺少了说服力。把世界重要著作大量介绍，使我们的知识领域扩大，给青年一代介绍丰富的文化遗产，对发展社会主义文化有好处。最近苏联有些人否定美国有民族文化，这种看法在国内也有，这就是一笔抹杀，一概否定的态度。
    雷海宗
    社会科学需要不断发展，但是马克思主义“还停留在1895年的地方”。
    资料不够，使许多人不能争鸣。对百家争鸣，虽然可能有顾虑，但从天津史学界来说，因有顾虑而不敢争鸣的还不多，主要是资料太少无法鸣。我们搞世界史的比其他部门材料更少。
    社会科学（包括历史学）有一个根本问题：社会科学是随资本主义产生而产生的，是到资本主义社会才成为一种严格的真正的科学；马克思恩格斯是在资产阶级社会科学的基础上用新方法和新观点为无产阶级建立了新的社会科学。这里就产生几个问题。一个是中国的社会科学没有资本主义的阶段，因为中国历史上没有经历资本主义，解放前虽向外国学了一点，很少，只是点缀性质，也没学透彻，在中国人的社会意识里没有这个东西。即或有少数人比较透彻的接触到资产阶级的社会科学，也是从国外留学时接触的，回国后就落后了，接不上去。过去只是为了点缀，今天要求我们继承过去人类的文化遗产，并在这个基础上来发展新的社会科学，不研究这些就不行。从这一点来看，资料问题就更大了。有些人认为我们只是在解放后才和资本主义的社会科学隔绝，其实过去也并不透彻了解，而今天要求我们比解放前有更多更透彻的了解。
    另外，对马克思和恩格斯树立的新的社会科学的看法，大家在理论上是一致的，承认马列主义应该发展，可是实际上是停止了发展，还停留在恩格斯死时1895年的地方。1895年以后，列宁斯大林在个别问题上有新的提法，但他们主要谈当前革命问题。从了解整理几千年来人类历史经验，建立新的社会科学来说，基本上停留在1895年。教条主义者就是这样。马克思恩格斯生平也是经常修改他们的学说，他们注意到当时每一个社会科学部门的发展情况，掌握科学研究的材料和成果。可是以后人们就认为他们已解决了一切问题，社会科学不能再发展了。事实上并不如此。1895年以后社会科学上新材料很多，对旧材料有很多新的认识。我们今天的任务，就是要把1895年到今天六十二年的课补上。这不是那一个个人的问题，而是整个社会主义阵营的问题，工作艰巨得很。解放以前对资本主义社会科学已经不是全面掌握，最近新订了一些资本主义国家的刊物，好多问题就不了解，看不懂。资本主义国家有些社会科学家是反动的，如凯恩斯，是为帝国主义服务的，但今天也有许多资本主义社会科学家并不是有意为帝国主义服务的。有的只是一个认识问题，不直接牵涉到立场，只是对材料的分析研究不同。当然，分析到最后，任何一个社会科学家都是有立场的。另外历史问题，如希腊史，六十二年来发现了好多材料。1890年在埃及发现的雅典宪法，可以说明好多问题。这本书恩格斯未看到，他如果看到，他在“家族、私有制和国家的起源”一书中在有些问题的提法上就会不同。社会科学是需要不断发展的：在理论上大家都这样说，在实践上却认为社会科学是停留在1895年的了。
    我和郑天挺先生不大写文章主要是材料不够。过去学的好多东西，现在没有用，今天有用的东西，过去没有学，需要从头学起。过去我们买了不少资本主义国家的书，但是有用的书没有买。尤其是研究世界史书太缺乏了。目前我们图书馆要买书，经费又受限制。
    对年龄大一点的人来说，他们有他们几十年的习惯，在研究一个问题时，得掌握全面或比较全面的材料才能讲话。今天有许多问题是值得谈的，可是不掌握材料就没法谈。因此不大量地把过去没有买来的书买到，进行研究就很困难。我们要体会马克思恩格斯研究问题的方法，而不是光揣摩他们的结论。马克思恩格斯是掌握六十二年前的材料做出的结论，如果他们掌握了今天的材料，就会另作结论。如果拿六十二年前马恩研究希腊史时的结论来解决中国古代史问题，这当然解决不了问题，而只会把问题搞得越来越糊涂。
    编者注：雷先生认为社会科学需要不断发展，而为了发展社会科学，这就需要反对教条主义，这个意见无疑是正确的。但是雷先生认为列宁对于马克思主义只是“在个别问题上有新的提法”，马克思主义“基本上停留在1895年”，这却是违反了事实。马克思主义的社会科学，这是说马克思主义关于社会发展的基本理论，而不是说关于个别事实的个别论断。列宁正是在社会科学的一系列基本理论方面，首先是关于帝国主义，关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政，关于社会主义建设等基本理论方面，向前发展了马克思主义。没有这些发展，没有同第二国际的机会主义的斗争，就不会有十月革命和社会主义的苏联。各国共产党人对于马克思主义的发展也都有他们的贡献。我们中国共产党人，把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命的具体实践相结合，克服了右的和“左”的机会主义，也使马克思列宁主义得到了新的发展，因而能够在中国实现民主主义革命和社会主义革命。这些都是人所共知的。而雷先生所说的关于六十二年来古代史的发现，却只是涉及到马克思、恩格斯著作中的个别论断。古代史的研究者当然应该根据新发现的事实，去补充以至修正那些个别论断，但是补充和修正这些个别论断，并不影响马克思主义的基本理论。这是我们的看法，希望大家讨论。

    不同的意见应在说服和讨论的基础上去解决，避免随便扣帽子。
    过去这几年，特别是自1952年以后，大家写文章说话的确都有些顾虑。原因是多方面的，其中是有部分同志正如毛主席所指出的，想用粗暴的简单的方法，来解决思想问题。我是学经济地理的，但我就提心吊胆地怕被扣上“地理环境决定论”的帽子。又如解放后大家一致要求学习苏联的先进科学和经验，这是好的，但当时为一些教条所束缚，有某些问题虽然对自己没有多大的说服力，也只好勉强地全盘地加以接受。例如苏联教材中有关于批评某些十月革命前的德国资产阶级的地理学者的材料，这是针对苏联情况而写的，和中国实际就不完全结合，但是自己又怕根据我国的情况多讲一些，就会走样子，犯错误。这样在教学质量的提高上当然是受到一定的影响，更谈不到在学术思想上的百家争鸣了。这是一个方面。同时，在业务上旧的东西不能讲，新的又搞不来，而且对于自从抗日战争以后将近二十年来的西方学术界的情况也不很了解，形成了青黄不接、空虚徬徨的境地。这样要想争鸣当然也不可能。可是最近一年多来，这种情况有了很大的改变。以我自己来说，去年夏天的中国地理学会学术讨论会上以及报刊经常报道的一些学术问题争鸣的情况，尤其是在经过最近天津市委的宣传工作会议中所受的生动教育以后，使我在思想认识上也跟着有了变化；目前，顾虑是基本上消除了，只是在想如何积极创造条件参加到百家争鸣的行列中来。
    在争鸣的过程中，我以为有几点值得注意：一、意见不同的应该在说服和讨论的基础上解决，力求避免扣帽子。当然，就全国范围来说，扣帽子的现象是很少有了，但是如果具体到一个小的单位如教研室、研究组里，还不能说是已经完全绝迹。二、百家争鸣和学术工作的推进是长期性的，要防止急躁情绪。三、争鸣的园地应该扩大，可以尽量利用学会等学术团体来开展争鸣。四、希望能在一些具有全国性意义的报纸（如人民日报和光明、文汇等报）上，增加学术动态的报道，使大家能够即时地得到启发，并且还可以起一种鼓舞作用。
    张恒寿
    批评应该创造一种从团结愿望出发的新风格。
    对百家争鸣，目前有一种新的顾虑，就是怕自己鸣得不好，达不到要求，因此慎重过度。应该有意见就说出来。
    其次，还有对百家争鸣有不积极鼓励的看法。例如陈其通等对文艺问题的估计，就是只看见坏的方面，看不见好的方面。在学校里也有这种情况。有人说，号召向科学进军以后，好多教师不重视教学工作了，这是不符合事实的。从我们学校来看，大部分教师还是专心于教学工作。这种说法也是受了不赞成百家争鸣的看法的影响。
    正确的东西是在和错误的东西作斗争中产生的。马列主义要发展，必须要经过和错误的东西作斗争。反面的东西有时会给人一定的启发，唯心主义在某些方面可以启发我们。批评的态度一定要从团结的愿望出发。好多人写批评文章学习了马列主义经典作家的笔法，但经典作家的批评多半是对敌人的。我们似乎应该创造一种风格，使批评文章写得既有争鸣的风趣，又使人容易接受。
    历史和哲学方面的教条主义，有一些不是掌握材料多少问题。例如中国古代史的材料大家掌握得差不多，主要是在分析研究的方法上有问题。老一辈的专家如果多学一些理论，多写一些理论结合实际的文章可以给年青的同志一个榜样，克服年青的同志的教条主义。在哲学研究上如果要改变教条主义，应该提倡把深入分析和学习历史结合起来。
    季陶达
    研究经济要从中国实际出发，不要从概念出发。
    百家争鸣方针的提出，我认为是一个思想解放，是一个为了社会主义建设的思想解放。这个方针是根据我国具体条件提出来的，并不是如同有些人所说的为着国际宣传。其次，所谓争鸣，当然不是乱鸣。既然不是乱鸣，就应该有一个中心的指导思想，这一个指导思想就是马克思列宁主义。说百家，到底是那些家呢？我们说百家，若从学术系统来说，实际上不止百家。但在哲学方面概括起来，只是二家，即唯心主义和唯物主义两家。可是唯物主义也有真有假，到底谁真谁假，要经过百家争鸣才知道。所以我认为，目前不存在放和收的问题。
    在百家争鸣的方针提出以后，争鸣的文章是很多。从经济学方面说，也收到了很大的效果。有些问题从前不曾提出来，现在都提出来了。例如，对于社会主义商品的提法，我们现在也讨论起来了。但是，从前斯大林对商品的提法，是在苏联已经建成社会主义以后的条件下提出来的，而我们今天的条件则和苏联不同。百家争鸣以后，文章固然是多起来了，这些文章我看过的并不多，但是从已经看过的文章来说，觉得有这样一个缺点：许多文章都是从概念出发，不是从中国实际出发。例如，在社会主义经济条件下之价值规律及其作用的研究，是个极其重要的问题。苏联有一位老教授С．Г．СТРУМИЛИН院士，今年八十岁了。他在很久以前就已注意到这个问题，并且也作出了重要的贡献，但是一直到今天，苏联对于这个问题也还没有彻底解决。我国学者在斯大林的最后著作“苏联社会主义经济问题”发表以后，在1953年起曾讨论这个问题，而从“百家争鸣”这个方针提出后，对于这个问题的讨论更为热闹，比起上一次讨论来是已较深入了。但与现实的联系仍不够密切。因为这些讨论只是根据别人已有的结论来讨论，而不是根据我们的具体情况和实际材料出发的。所以说，现在的普遍的缺点是没有实际材料。科学研究能结合实际最好，比如，现在对天津的自由市场作一番调查，那倒是有好处的，这不仅对天津市的自由市场之处理和研究有好处，就是对价值规律的研究也是有好处的。
    其次，我觉得经济理论方面虽然也争鸣，但是其中的空白点也很多。毛主席在十多年前，在“改造我们的学习”一文中就指出我们只知外国，不知道中国，但是那时号召我们研究的问题，有些到“百家争鸣”的方针提出后才开始。例如中国经济史、中国经济思想史的研究，都是空白。中国经济史的研究着手得还比较早一点，已露出争鸣的序幕。例如关于中国资本主义生产方式之萌芽问题，已开始发表各种见解了。而中国经济思想史则目前连影子也没有，图书资料的困难更大。我们知道的书，有的就是找不到。比如我现在研究魏沅的经济思想，关于魏沅的四、五部著作都找不着。有些书，图书馆里有，但因管理不善，找不出来。
    此外，人材如何使用也是一个问题，如中国经济思想史，从前很少有人搞过，现在搞起来，更需要有组织地进行。
    人民日报有学术动态，这很好。不过，有些动态最好能指出研究的方向，使研究这门科学的人节约时间，少走弯路，也可以在动态中指出研究中的缺点。　（完）
