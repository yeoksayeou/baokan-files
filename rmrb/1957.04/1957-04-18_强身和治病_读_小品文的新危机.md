Strengthening the Body and Curing Disease
—Reading "The New Crisis of Essays"
Gao Zhi

I believe that essays (杂文) have two roles: to cure disease and to strengthen the body, to act as medicine and as exercise.

The human body's functions are forever in contradiction and unity, in normalcy and imbalance; fullness and hunger cycle endlessly, waking and sleeping alternate without rest, sometimes strong and vigorous, sometimes weak and sick. For a healthy body, we need physical exercise; when functions are unbalanced, we need medicine. Exercise is directly for strengthening the body; medicine for curing disease is indirectly for health and strengthening the body. Exercise is active training, aiming to "gain" health, while medicine is passive treatment, aiming to "lose" disease. The methods are different, but they complement each other and are both for the good of the body. In exercise, we must exert effort; sometimes we even sweat. In treatment, we feel some inconvenience or pain; medicine, whether powder, liquid, or pill, is sometimes bitter, and injections are always painful. And then there's surgery, involving bleeding and cutting!

In social life and social relations, in personal life and thought, contradictions are eternal, and contradictions always have two sides. Within the people, within an individual's mind, there are always contradictions between the advanced and the backward, the correct and the erroneous, the whole and the part (individual), long-term issues and immediate problems. To achieve the unity of each contradiction, we use various means to make the advanced, correct, positive, and affirmative things "gain" victory, and to make the backward, erroneous, negative, and reverse things "lose" their effect.

I think that today, essays written by people within the people, for the contradictions within the people, should have two roles: to use literary and rational methods to promote righteousness and suppress evil, to make social life and individual thought "gain" health and "lose" disease, that is, to play the role of "exercise" and "medicine."

Here, exercise is "moving" the mind, and medicine is "curing" mental illness. Moving the mind is to recognize and believe in correct and advanced things, and then support them and fight for them, aiming to "gain" health of social life and individual thought; while "curing" mental illness is to recognize and disbelieve in erroneous and backward things, and then hate them and strive to eliminate them, aiming to "lose" the problems of social life and individual thought.

Therefore, essays can both criticize and satirize, and also praise and eulogize. Essays can both cure mental illness like medicine, causing ideological struggle and ideological pain, and also make people move their minds like exercise, causing ideological training and "ideological sweating."

Essays, as literary powders, liquids, and pills, are sometimes bitter and hard to swallow; as literary plasters, applied to the face, they sometimes hinder beauty; as literary injection needles, they are always painful; as literary surgery, it requires ideological flesh cutting and bleeding.

In medicine, to avoid pain, anesthesia can be used. In thought, however, there is no anesthesia to eliminate ideological pain, unless it is ideological numbness. However, ideological numbness must also be "cured," just as hemiplegia and total paralysis must be treated.

The Party's policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom," includes essays; essays can use various writing styles to discuss problems. Even the description of scenery, the analysis of psychology, the statement of theory, and the explanation of things can be mixed and matched to create platter-style essays or alloy injection needle-style essays, while for the enemy, they are alloy "dagger" essays.

Essays can have thorns, and can also have fragrance and color, like roses. Of course, the fragrance and color of essays should not degenerate into beautifying ugliness, and the thorns of essays should only pierce pustules.

    强身和治病
    ——读“小品文的新危机”
    高植
    我认为，小品文（杂文）有两方面的作用，有治病的作用，也有强身的作用，有医药的作用，也有运动的作用。
    人的身体机能，永远是在矛盾和统一中，在正常和失调中；饱与饥循环不已，醒与睡轮流不息，有时精强力壮，有时软弱生病。为了身体健康，我们需要体育运动；有时机能失调，就需要医药了。运动是直接地为了强身；医药为了治病，是间接地为了健康与强身。运动是积极锻炼，是要“得到”健康，而医药是消极治疗，是要“失去”疾病。方式方法不同，但相反相成，都是为了身体的好。在运动中，我们要使劲用力；有时还要淌汗。在治疗中，我们要感到一些不便或痛苦，药粉、药水、药丸，有时苦口，而打针就疼痛了。还有流血挖肉的开刀！
    在社会生活和社会关系中，在个人生活和思想中，矛盾是永远有的，而矛盾总是有两个方面。在人民内部，在个人脑中，总是有先进和落后、正确和错误、整体与部分（个人）、长远问题与目前问题的矛盾。为了求得每一次的矛盾的统一，我们用种种方式使先进的、正确的、积极的、正面的事物“得到”胜利，使落后的、错误的、消极的、反面的事物“失去”作用。
    我想，今天，人民内部的人所写的小品文，为人民内部的矛盾而写的小品文，应该有两方面的作用，就是以文艺的、说理的方式，助长正气、压倒邪气，使社会生活、个人思想“得到”健康，“失去”疾病，也就是起“运动”和“医药”的作用。
    这里的运动是“动”脑筋，医药是“治”心病。动脑筋，是为了认识、相信正确的、先进的事物，进而拥护它们，为它们而奋斗，是要“得到”社会生活与个人思想的健康；而“治”心病，是为了认识、不相信错误、落后的事物，进而憎恨它们，为消除它们而努力，是要“失去”社会生活与个人思想的毛病。
    因此，小品文既可以批评、讽刺，也可以表扬、歌颂。小品文既可以像医药那样地治心病，引起思想斗争、思想痛苦，也可以像运动那样地使人动脑筋，引起思想锻炼、“思想淌汗”。
    小品文，作为文艺的药粉、药水、药丸有时是苦口难吞的，作为文艺的药膏，敷在脸上，有时是妨碍美观的，作为文艺的注射针，却总是疼痛的，作为文艺的开刀，那便要有思想上的挖肉流血了。
    在医药上，要不痛，可以用麻药。在思想上，却没有麻药来消除思想的疼痛，除非是思想麻痹。然而思想麻痹也得“治”，正如同半身不遂、全身麻痹一样地要治。
    党的百花齐放的政策，包括小品文在内；小品文可以用各种各样的写法来谈问题。甚至风景的描写、心理的分析、理论的陈述、事物的说明，也无妨混杂调配，写成拼盘式的小品文，或合金注射针式的小品文，而对敌人，则是合金“匕首”的小品文了。
    小品文可以有刺，也可以有香有色，比方说，像玫瑰花吧。当然，杂文的香和色不要流于美化丑恶，而小品文的刺只应该刺破脓疮。
