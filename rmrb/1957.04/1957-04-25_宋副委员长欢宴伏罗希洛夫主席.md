Before the banquet, Vice Chairman Song Qingling had a cordial conversation with Chairman Voroshilov in her elegant living room.

Vice Chairman Song Qingling said that she was very happy to see Chairman Voroshilov in Shanghai. She said that she had met Chairman Voroshilov in the Soviet Union in 1928 and still remembered what Chairman Voroshilov had said to her at that time. Chairman Voroshilov said that the Soviet leaders at that time were very concerned about the Chinese revolution, and the death of Sun Yat-sen made the Soviet leaders very sorry. He said that Sun Yat-sen was a great friend of the Soviet Union.

Chairman Voroshilov repeatedly praised Vice Chairman Song Qingling's outstanding contributions to the cause of the Chinese people's revolution. He said that it is not easy for a person to stick to his or her will in difficult circumstances. Some people are helpless in the face of difficulties, while others can overcome them. Madame Sun is such a person. He said that Vice Chairman Song Qingling is an example of the bravest woman. He admired Vice Chairman Song Qingling's past and present. The Soviet people and the people of the world admire Song Qingling very much. Vice Chairman Song Qingling repeatedly thanked Chairman Voroshilov for his encouragement. She said that without the support of the masses, she could not do anything.

Chairman Voroshilov said to Vice Chairman Song Qingling, you have been to the Soviet Union more than once, and you have personally seen the Soviet people's concern for the Chinese people. The friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is the closest. We are as happy to see that the Chinese people are living well as if it were our own.

During the banquet, Vice Chairman Song Qingling repeatedly raised her glass to the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people and to the health of Chairman Voroshilov.

After the banquet, Chairman Voroshilov took a walk on the porch in front of the house. At this time, the rain had stopped and the sky had cleared, and the trees in the garden were lush and green. Vice Chairman Song Qingling picked a branch of tropical orchids and personally pinned it on Chairman Voroshilov's lapel. A crisp bell rang in the sky, and she told the distinguished guests that it was a performance by her own pet doves of peace.

Before parting, Vice Chairman Song Qingling gave Chairman Voroshilov and the accompanying Soviet guests Fujian lacquerware, embroidery, tea and other Chinese specialties. (Attached picture)

    宋副委员长欢宴伏罗希洛夫主席
    新华社上海24日电　今天中午，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席、中苏友好协会总会会长宋庆龄，在上海住宅举行宴会，欢迎伏罗希洛夫主席和他同来的苏联客人拉希多夫、叶留金、费德林、尤金以及伏罗希洛夫主席的儿子和儿媳。
    刘少奇委员长，副总理贺龙元帅，中共中央上海局书记、中共上海市委员会第一书记柯庆施，上海市副市长曹荻秋，中国驻苏联大使刘晓和夫人都出席作陪。
    入席前，宋庆龄副委员长在她幽雅的客厅里和伏罗希洛夫主席作了亲切的谈话。
    宋庆龄副委员长说，能够在上海看到伏罗希洛夫主席她非常高兴。她说，1928年她在苏联的时候曾经和伏罗希洛夫主席见过面，并且还记得当年伏罗希洛夫主席对她讲的话。伏罗希洛夫主席说，当时苏联的领导人对中国革命非常关心，孙中山的逝世使苏联领导人非常惋惜。他说，孙中山是苏联的伟大的朋友。
    伏罗希洛夫主席一再赞誉宋庆龄副委员长对中国人民革命事业的卓越贡献。他说，一个人要在艰难的环境中坚持自己的意志是很不容易的，有人在困难面前就无能为力了；有人却能克服困难，孙夫人就是这样的人。他说，宋庆龄副委员长是最勇敢的妇女的榜样。他对宋庆龄副委员长的过去和现在的种种，都十分敬佩。苏联人民和全世界人民都十分敬佩宋庆龄。宋庆龄副委员长再三感谢伏罗希洛夫主席对她的鼓励。她说，没有群众的支持，她什么事情都做不到。
    伏罗希洛夫主席对宋庆龄副委员长说，您到苏联不止一次，您亲自看到苏联人民对中国人民的关怀，中苏两国人民的友谊是最亲密的。我们看到中国人民生活得很好，就像自己的事情一样高兴。
    在宴会进行中，宋庆龄副委员长一再为中苏人民牢不可破的友谊和伏罗希洛夫主席的健康而举杯祝贺。
    宴会以后，伏罗希洛夫主席到屋前走廊里散步。这时，雨过天晴，花园里的树木苍翠欲滴，宋庆龄副委员长摘了一枝热带的兰花，亲自佩在伏罗希洛夫主席的衣襟上。天空中传来一阵清脆的铃声，她告诉贵宾，这是她自己喂养的和平鸽在表演。
    临别时，宋庆龄副委员长又把中国的特产福建漆器、刺绣品、茶叶等送给伏罗希洛夫主席和同来的苏联客人。（附图片）
