Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, April 9th: The Cambodian National Assembly unanimously approved the new cabinet headed by Prince Sihanouk last night, ending Cambodia's ten-day cabinet crisis.

Prince Sihanouk had initially refused to take on the role of new prime minister. On April 5th, a large number of deputies met with him, requesting that he resume office.

After forming the new cabinet, Prince Sihanouk, in a speech to the National Assembly, declared: "His government will resolutely uphold the policy of neutrality. Patriotic Cambodian citizens must cherish peaceful coexistence and neutrality."

Sihanouk said that his policy program had already been announced on April 5th.

In explaining how to solve economic problems, Sihanouk specifically mentioned the issues of cement and agricultural production. He said that his government would establish a higher technical school to train technicians and specialized personnel.

Speaking of domestic affairs, he emphasized the unity of the entire nation. He said that a socialist youth organization would be established to provide theoretical and technical training to young people. This organization would recruit young students and young workers.

Sihanouk concluded by requesting the deputies to cooperate with the government and jointly seek the progress of the country.

In the new cabinet, Prime Minister Sihanouk also holds the portfolios of Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Interior, and Minister of Planning. There have been significant changes in the cabinet lineup this time. Only five members of the previous cabinet have been retained, including Mo Shupi, the Minister of National Security and Religious Affairs. The new cabinet members include those from the National Assembly, such as Fang Sang (appointed as State Secretary of the Prime Minister's Office, responsible for liaison between the Parliament and the Government, and responsible for peasant affairs) and Mao Sai (appointed as Minister of Social Work and Labor), and those from the People's Socialist Community or the Royal Council, such as Kulong (appointed as Minister of National Economy). Sang Sari, Chairman of the National Economic Committee, serves as an advisor to the Prime Minister, but is not a cabinet member.

Sources here believe that the changes in the cabinet lineup serve two purposes: first, to reconcile the long-standing opposition between the parliament and the government, and second, to strengthen leadership in the economic sphere.

    西哈努克组成新内阁
    宣布坚守中立政策　要求议员同政府合作
    新华社金边9日电　柬埔寨国民议会昨天晚上一致通过了以西哈努克亲王为首的新内阁，从而结束了柬埔寨的十天的内阁危机。
    西哈努克亲王曾经一度拒绝出任新首相。4月5日，曾经有大批议员去会见他，要求他重新执政。
    西哈努克亲王组成新内阁以后在向国民议会发表的一篇演说中宣布：“他的政府将坚决维护中立政策。爱国的柬埔寨公民必须爱护和平共处和中立。”
    西哈努克说，他的施政计划已经在4月5日公布。
    在说明如何解决经济问题的时候，西哈努克特别提到了水泥和农业生产问题。他说，他的政府将开办一所高等技术学校，来训练技术人员和专门人材。
    谈到内政问题的时候，他强调了全国人民的团结。他说，将成立一个社会主义青年组织来对青年进行理论和技术上的训练。这个组织将吸收青年学生、青年工人参加。
    西哈努克最后要求议员们同政府合作，共同谋求国家的进步。
    西哈努克首相在新内阁中兼任外交、内政、计划大臣。这次内阁人员有很大的变动，上届内阁阁员只有五人留任，其中有国家安全和宗教事务大臣莫舒皮。新阁员有来自国民议会的，如财政委员会主席方桑（任首相府负责议会和政府联系及负责农民事务国务秘书）、毛赛（任社会工作和劳工大臣），有来自人民社会同盟或皇廷最高会议的，如库隆（任国家经济大臣）。国家经济委员会主席桑·萨里担任首相顾问，但是不是内阁阁员。
    这里人士认为，这次内阁人员变动有两个目的，一是为了调和议会和政府之间长期存在的对立，二是为了加强经济方面的领导力量。
