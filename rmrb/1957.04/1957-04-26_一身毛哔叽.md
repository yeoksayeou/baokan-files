I have a family of eight to support, and our life is rather difficult. However, I actually managed to acquire a sharp suit of wool serge through the family's austerity. With polished leather shoes, a leather cap, and a fashionable overcoat to shield me from the cold northern winds of Beijing, I strode about with an air of prosperity. My family gave me all sorts of encouragement. My mother said, "You are often in public, you should dress better." My wife also helped me dress up, often sacrificing her own interests when buying clothes, so that I could stand dignified in public. I myself felt that if I was poorly dressed, I would have a very sensitive sense of inferiority in front of others, and my heart would often churn with unease and distress. Because clothing represents a person's social status. Once, I went to attend a CPPCC meeting. At the entrance of the meeting hall were two comrades receiving coats. When I arrived, they had just taken a comrade's otter-collared black woolen overcoat. Turning their heads, they saw me holding a gray cloth cotton jacket with a short plush collar, looked at me suspiciously, and asked contemptuously, "Are you here to deliver a letter?" The admission ticket for the meeting had been collected at Qianmen, and the car I was in was clearly parked in front of the meeting hall. How could a letter be delivered here? At that moment, I felt ashamed and quickly said, "I'm here for the meeting," and hurried to sit in a corner with my little cotton jacket.

After experiencing several cold and contemptuous glances, I decided to economize and save up for a suit of wool serge, hoping to vent my pent-up frustration.

Half a year later, I finally put on a suit of wool serge. The dignified navy blue color, the neatly padded shoulders, and the shapely lines made me feel completely at ease. Although I didn't feel superior because of it, I certainly enjoyed the elegant pleasure when I met envious glances. My wife joked with me, "Look at you, you don't know what to do now that you're wearing wool serge, you don't know where to put your hands and feet."

I have returned to Henan. Everywhere I look, I see simplicity.

I met Comrade Shi Xiangsheng, Secretary of the Henan Provincial Party Committee Secretariat of the Chinese Communist Party, in the winter of 1944, in the Yu-Xi Liberated Area. At that time, he was the Organization Minister of the Regional Party Committee, and one of the leading comrades who first gave me revolutionary education. I remember that in winter, he wore a gray, faded cotton cloth suit, a cotton hat with ear flaps, and a pair of farmers' shoes. Twelve years later, he is still the same, except that the cotton cloth has been replaced by fine cloth, the color is slightly darker, he seems to have a woolen hat, and the farmers' shoes have been replaced by the cloth shoes sold in department stores. This outfit, like the first time I heard him give a Party lecture twelve years ago, has a vivid educational significance for me, answering the cold, white glances, and making me feel the ugliness of my idea of striving for a suit of wool serge. Recalling the years of guerrilla warfare, my heart is very sad. At the same time, it seems that a clear stream has washed away the superficiality in my heart, and also cultivated ambition.

On Sunday, Comrade Shi Xiangsheng came to my house. Because there were not enough chairs in the room, the two of us squatted on the ground, surrounded by a charcoal fire, and talked. This form and this mood are the same as when we were fighting guerrillas, braving the smoke and roasting tree stumps. For some reason, in this situation, I have a desire to confide my shortcomings and ideological problems to my old superior. My children were making noise in front of him, and no matter how I tried to drive them away, they delayed my wish. When he said goodbye, my wife did not recognize Comrade Shi Xiangsheng (and I forgot to introduce him), and when she saw him off at the door, she said, "If you have nothing to do, come and play!" Comrade Shi Xiangsheng happily said, "Okay, I'll come when I'm free." I was a little surprised by this invitation, but I didn't say anything at the time. After seeing the guest off, I told my wife, "He is Comrade Shi Xiangsheng, the Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee." She said, "I treated him as a regular comrade."

I said to myself, yes, he is a "regular comrade."

    一身毛哔叽
    周因
    我一家八口人过活，生活比较清苦。但是，我竟然在全家节衣缩食之中，自己穿上了一身笔挺的毛哔叽。擦亮了皮鞋，戴上了皮帽，在北京街道上那寒冷的北风里，裹着入时的大衣，昂昂然，是一副阔绰的派头。家里人，对我有各种各样的鼓励。母亲说：“你常在公事场里，应该穿好点。”爱人也帮我打扮，为了使我能够仪表堂堂的立于大庭广众之间，常常在购置衣物时，牺牲了自己的利益。我自己更觉得，衣着不好，在人前就有很敏感的自卑感，心里也经常翻搅着不安和苦恼。因为，这衣着竟是代表人的社会地位的。一次，我去参加政协的一个会议。会议厅门口有两位接收大衣的同志。我去时，他们刚接过一位同志的水獭领黑呢大衣，一扭头，看见我拿着长毛绒小翻领灰布棉上衣，怀疑地看了一眼，轻蔑地问道：“你是不是送信的？”这个会议的入场券在前门就收了，我坐的汽车明明停在会议厅前，送信怎么会送到这里呢？那时，我竟自惭愧起来，连忙说声“是来开会的”，就赶快夹着小棉袄，去坐在一个角落里。
    受过几次冷蔑的逼人的眼光后，我决心节衣缩食，为一身毛哔叽而积蓄，想痛快地出一口闷气。
    隔了半年，我终于穿上一身毛哔叽了。庄严的藏青色，平整的双肩，曲直有致的线条，使人浑然自得。我虽然并未因此而觉得高人一等，但遇到投来的羡慕眼光，确也领受着高雅的风趣。我爱人向我开玩笑说：“你看你，穿身毛哔叽就不知该怎么着了，手脚都没处放了。”
    我回到河南来了。满眼都是朴素的景象。
    我认识中共河南省委书记处书记史向生同志，是1944年的冬天，在豫西解放区，那时他是地委组织部长，是最初给我革命教育的领导同志之一。我记得，冬天，他穿一身灰而发白的棉布衣，戴一顶有耳遮沿的棉帽，踏一双农民的鞋子。十二年以后的今天，他还是老样子，只是棉布换成了细布的，颜色稍深了一些，好像有了一顶呢质帽，农民的鞋子换成了百货公司卖的那种布鞋子。这身衣着，像十二年前我第一次听他讲党课一样，对我有着生动的教育意义，替我回答了冷白的眼光，使我感到自己为一身毛哔叽而奋斗的那种丑恶思想的要不得。回想起游击战争的岁月，心中很难过。同时，好像有一阵清水冲去了心里的浮华，也生长了志气。
    星期天，史向生同志来到我的家里。因为屋里缺少椅子，两个人蹲在地下，围着一盆炭火，谈起来了。这种形式和这种情绪，都和打游击时，冒着烟雾，烤树疙瘩是一样的。不知怎的，我在这种场合下，有一种老想向老上级倾诉自己的缺点和思想问题的愿望。我的孩子在他跟前闹来闹去，无论如何赶不走，耽误了我这个愿望。他告辞时，我爱人不认识史向生同志（我也忘记了介绍），送到门口，她说：“没有事，就来玩吧！”史向生同志高兴地说：“好，闲了就来。”我为这个邀请有些吃惊，但当时也不好说话。送走了客人，我告诉爱人说：“他就是省委书记史向生同志”。她说：“我把他当成了一般同志了。”
    我心里说，是的，他就是“一般同志”。（附图片）
