    Yongding River Water Diversion Project Completed and Water Released
    (Xinhua News Agency, April 24th) The Yongding River Water Diversion Project has been completed, and a water release ceremony was held today at the Sanjiadian Dam construction site in the western suburbs of Beijing.
    At 4:15 PM, after Beijing Deputy Mayor Feng Jiping cut the ribbon, workers slowly cranked up the闸门 [sluice gates], and the Yongding River water surged into the canal.
    The Yongding River Water Diversion Project began construction on January 16th last year and was originally scheduled to be completed in three years. Thanks to the help of various departments, the Yongding River water was diverted to Beijing one year and three months ahead of schedule.
    The Modekou Hydropower Station, which uses the Yongding River water to generate electricity, also officially began transmitting electricity to Beijing today.

    工业常识永定河引水工程完工放水
    据新华社24日讯　永定河引水工程已经完工，今天在北京西郊三家店拦河坝工地举行放水仪式。
    下午四时一刻，北京市副市长冯基平剪彩以后，工人们徐徐地绞起闸门，永定河水翻腾地涌进渠道。
    永定河引水工程是在去年1月16日动工兴建的，原定计划三年完成；由于各部门的帮助，使永定河水提前一年零三个月引到北京。
    利用永定河水发电的模式口水电站也在今天正式向北京送电。
