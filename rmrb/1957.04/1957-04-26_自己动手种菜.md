    Growing Your Own Vegetables
    All cadres and their families of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway Administration are reclaiming wasteland to grow vegetables in their spare time. Each person decided to reclaim a fen of land, and all personnel can reclaim fifty mu of wasteland, producing 250,000 jin of vegetables. In this way, 90,000 jin of vegetables can be saved from being transported from the mainland each year. Fifteen trucks can also be freed up to transport other urgently needed materials.
    Now, sowing has begun on the newly reclaimed wasteland, and they will be able to eat the vegetables they grow themselves in June.
              (Zhao Jingzhi, Ma Yue)

    自己动手种菜
    青藏公路管理局全体干部和家属，利用业余时间开荒种菜。每人决定开荒地一分，全体人员可开出荒地五十亩，生产蔬菜二十五万斤。这样一年就可少从内地运送去九万斤蔬菜。也可腾出十五辆汽车去运其它急需的物资。
    现在，在新开出来的荒地上已经开始播种，六月间他们就可以吃上自己种的蔬菜了。
