Infant Cloth Can Be Greatly Conserved

After reading the article "Look, an Infant Needs So Many Things" published in the People's Daily on April 14th, as a childcare worker, I would like to offer some opinions.

The fact that an infant needs 135 chi of cloth per year is indeed disproportionate to our country's current production level and differs greatly from the consumption of the vast majority of the people in the country. I believe that infants' clothes should be made from adults' old clothes as much as possible. Diapers can be made from old quilt covers and old clothes, and the size can be reduced (some diapers can be square), and the number does not need to be twenty. Of course, this requires us to strengthen our work, such as washing and mending frequently, and older children should also be "taught to urinate" so that they develop the habit of regular bowel movements.

Secondly, kindergartens or nurseries generally require more clothes to be brought in when admitting children. For example, spring and autumn are very short in the north, so is it really necessary to have three pairs of lined pants and two lined jackets? If single-layer clothes can be washed frequently, I don't think three sets are needed.

At present, it is true that many comrades emphasize collecting more things for the convenience of their work. I hope that childcare workers will pay attention to the issue raised by the People's Daily and try to save every chi and every cun of cotton cloth as much as possible, which is by no means insignificant for the country's construction.

    乳儿用布，大可节约
    看了4月14日人民日报登的“看，一个乳儿要用这么多东西”一文以后，作为一个保育工作者的我，愿意提一些意见。
    一个乳儿一年要用一百三十五尺布，确实与我们国家目前的生产水平不相称，与全国广大人民的消费量来比也相差太大。我认为，乳儿的衣服，应尽量利用成人的旧衣改作；尿布则可利用破被单、破旧衣服改制，在尺寸方面可以加以压缩，（可以有一部分尿布是方形的），数量也不要二十块。当然，这就需要加强我们的工作，像勤洗、勤补，较大的孩子还应该“把尿”，使他们养成定时大小便的习惯等等。
    其次，一般幼儿园或乳儿室在收托孩子时，需要带的衣服确实多了一些。譬如，北方春、秋天的时间很短，是不是一定要三条夹裤、两件夹袄呢？单衣裤如果能够勤洗的话，我看也用不了三套。
    目前，确实有许多同志为了自己工作的方便，强调多收一些东西。我希望保育工作者重视人民日报提出的这个问题，多多设法节约每一尺、每一寸棉布，这对国家的建设事业决不是无足轻重的事。
