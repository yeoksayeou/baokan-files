Report on the Visit of the Delegation of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China to the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, and Yugoslavia
    ——March 31, 1957, at an Enlarged Meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress
    Head of the Delegation of the National People's Congress, Peng Zhen

Chairman, esteemed members, comrades:
    The delegation of the National People's Congress accepted the invitations of the six countries of the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, and Yugoslavia, and conducted friendly visits. From our departure on November 15, 1956, to our return on February 1, 1957, the journey lasted seventy-nine days. We departed in the bitter cold of winter, but wherever we went, the enthusiastic welcome and cordial hospitality made us feel warmer than spring. Wherever the delegation went, thousands upon thousands of brothers and sisters, dressed in festive attire, cheered us along the roads, regarding us as relatives and friends from afar, calling us "dear brothers." In the icy and snowy north, they greeted us with flowers; in the south, they welcomed us with lush green palm leaves. Along the way, we often heard Chinese music played in welcome of the delegation and saw Chinese national flags displayed. In many places, even the welcome banners were written in Chinese characters. They called us "envoys of the great Chinese people."
    We held cordial talks with the leading comrades of the parliaments, governments, parties, and mass organizations of these brotherly countries, as well as with comrades working in various fields, and we met with many people. We visited many beautiful cities and villages, and we toured many large-scale factories, farms, schools, scientific and cultural institutions, and municipal facilities. These socialist constructions fully demonstrate that under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Workers' Party, the Labor Party, and the governments, the people of these brotherly countries have highly developed their diligence, courage, and wisdom. They are engaging in socialist construction with full confidence and vitality. Whether in industry, agriculture, science, culture, or education, they have already achieved brilliant successes. On the basis of the development of production, the people's material and cultural living standards have obviously improved. In socialist countries, the people are well-fed and clothed, have forever escaped the suffering of exploitation and unemployment, and have truly become the masters of the country.
    Through this visit, we have seen the great achievements of these brotherly countries, which fully demonstrate the superiority of the socialist system. We personally felt the high political consciousness and proletarian internationalism of the people of these brotherly countries, and we felt the deep friendship and solidarity between socialist countries. This is the guarantee of world peace and the cause of human progress, and it is also an eternally invincible force.

    I. In the Soviet Union
    The delegation arrived in Moscow on November 15, 1956, and left the Soviet Union on December 2. During these eighteen days, we visited the Soviet capital, Moscow, the cradle of the October Revolution, Leningrad, and the capital of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic, Tashkent. In addition, we made brief stops in Irkutsk, Omsk, Tbilisi, and Kiev; and during our journey from Czechoslovakia to Romania, we passed through Ukraine and Moldova. Wherever we appeared on Soviet territory, we were warmly welcomed and cordially received by the masses of the people and leading comrades.
    In Moscow, we paid respects at the Lenin and Stalin Mausoleum and laid wreaths. In Leningrad, we visited the Smolny Palace, the headquarters of the October Revolution armed uprising, the Razliv Lenin hideout, and the cruiser "Aurora," which fired the shots of the glorious uprising against the Winter Palace, as well as other relics of Lenin and the October Revolution.
    During the visit, we held discussions with leading comrades of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the Moscow and Leningrad City Soviets, the Supreme Soviets of the Russian Federation and the Uzbek Republic, as well as some district and village soviets, regarding the organization and work of soviets at all levels. In the discussions, we focused on understanding the work of the standing committees of soviets at all levels. The two chambers of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and the Supreme Soviets of the Union Republics have committees for credentials, budget, foreign affairs, and legislation. Local soviets have more standing committees. For example, the Moscow City Soviet has twelve standing committees, the Leningrad City Soviet has thirteen standing committees (industry, budget, capital construction, national education, health, culture, urban transportation and post and telecommunications, public utilities and urban improvement, housing, gas and heating, commerce and public canteens, social security, building materials, etc.), the Red Presnya District Soviet of Moscow has eight standing committees, and the Durman Village Soviet of the Orjonikidze District of Tashkent Oblast has six standing committees. The main task of the standing committees is to assist the soviets and their executive bodies in implementing the resolutions of the soviets and to supervise and inspect the implementation of the resolutions, and to reflect the opinions of the voters to the soviets and their executive bodies. The standing committees are composed of a certain number of representatives elected by the soviets. According to the needs of the work, they can absorb experts and activists from the residents to participate in the work. For example, the thirteen standing committees of the Leningrad City Soviet have a total of two hundred and nineteen representatives and one thousand five hundred experts and activists participating in the work. In the discussions, we learned about some specific situations of the standing committees in supervising and inspecting the work of the executive bodies of the soviets. For example, the Commerce and Public Canteen Standing Committee of the Moscow City Soviet once inspected the storage of food in food stores, submitted the discovered shortcomings to the executive committee of the city soviet for discussion, and the executive committee of the city soviet made a resolution to improve the work, educated and disciplined the relevant derelict personnel, and improved the work. The parliaments of the other brotherly countries we visited also have several standing committees, and their role is somewhat the same as that of the Soviet Union.
    In Moscow, we visited enterprises such as the atomic energy power station and the aircraft manufacturing plant. In Leningrad, we visited the Kirov Electrical Machinery Plant, the Optical Instrument Factory, the Skorokhod Shoe Factory, and the Mikoyan Sugar Refinery. In Tashkent, we visited the combined textile factory. These factories all possess modern technical equipment and have many advanced experiences in increasing production and practicing economy, improving labor productivity, improving product quality, reducing costs, and especially in reducing non-direct production personnel.
    After the October Revolution, the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, overcame various difficulties and completed the socialist industrialization at an unprecedented speed in human history, building their own independent industrial system and achieving great achievements. In 1955, the total output of industry increased more than twenty times compared with 1929. This ironclad fact fully demonstrates the superiority of the socialist system.
    In recent years, the Soviet Union has also achieved remarkable achievements in land reclamation. From 1954 to the end of 1956, 35.5 million hectares of virgin and fallow land were reclaimed, exceeding the original plan by more than two times. In addition, high-yield crops such as corn have been promoted. Therefore, in 1956, the country purchased more than 3.3 billion poods of grain, a significant increase compared with the past few years (in the past few years, the country purchased about 2 billion to 2.2 billion poods per year, and each pood is equal to 32.76 Chinese Jin). This not only guaranteed the needs of the people, but also increased the grain reserves. The output of cotton also increased in 1956. The Uzbek Republic we visited is the cotton-producing area of the Soviet Union, and its output accounts for two-thirds of the total cotton output of the Soviet Union. In 1956, the Uzbek Republic sold 2.86 million tons of cotton to the state, which was about 400,000 tons more than the sales volume in 1955. The cotton yield per unit area in the Uzbek Republic is relatively high. For example, in the 5,938 hectares of cotton fields in the Orjonikidze District of Tashkent Oblast, the harvest per hectare was 38.7 quintals. Before the October Revolution, the economy and culture of Uzbekistan were backward. After the October Revolution, Uzbekistan developed industry, agriculture, science and technology, and developed water conservancy and irrigation, gradually turning the desert into fertile fields, thus changing the past backwardness and becoming an advanced industrial and agricultural area.
    With the continuous rise of industrial and agricultural production, the living standards of the Soviet people are continuing to improve. There is no unemployment problem in the Soviet Union like in capitalist countries. The working hours of workers and staff have been shortened, and wages are being further adjusted, increasing low wages and shortening the distance between high and low wages. The lives of farmers have also improved. The lives of those who are old and unable to work and the disabled have been taken care of.
    In Moscow, we visited Moscow University, the Institute of International Relations, the All-Union Agricultural and Industrial Exhibition, art galleries, etc. In Leningrad, we visited Leningrad University, the All-Union Plant Protection Research Institute, the Forestry Engineering Academy, the Pulkovo Observatory, and the Hermitage Museum. In Tashkent, we visited the Academy of Sciences of the Uzbek Republic and other cultural and scientific institutions. We saw some of the scale and achievements of Soviet scientific research, and we saw the wide application of atomic energy in industry and agriculture. The Soviet Union attaches importance to the cultivation of scientific talents, and there are many scientific talents. The Soviet Union vigorously carries out scientific research work, and many scientific departments are at the forefront of the world.
    During the visit, we had cordial conversations with comrades such as Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Lobanov, Chairman of the Union Council of the Supreme Soviet, Lacis, Chairman of the National Council, Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and other leading comrades of the parliament, the government, and the party, as well as the leading comrades of the Russian Federation Republic, the Uzbek Republic, Moscow, and Leningrad, and many other working comrades. We met with enthusiastic people from all walks of life in the Hall of Columns in Moscow. In the factory, we were welcomed by countless Soviet worker brothers. In the countryside, we received the family-like treatment of many farmers. The comrades in schools, children's palaces, and other cultural institutions were also very kind and enthusiastic to us. Some of these friends are working hard to manufacture machines for China, some are helping our staff to carry out internships, and some are training our students. Everywhere we saw friendship, cooperation, and the brotherly feelings of the Soviet people towards the Chinese people. The friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is eternal and unbreakable.
    During our visit, the brilliant achievements of the Soviet people under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government that we witnessed firsthand undeniably prove that the road of the October Revolution is a glorious road. The Soviet people's revolutionary experience and socialist construction experience are extremely rich. It has inspired and will continue to inspire the proletariat and progressive mankind all over the world to fight for the victory of peace, democracy, and socialism. The Soviet people saved mankind from fascist slavery in the Second World War, and then carried out large-scale construction after the war, providing great assistance and support to brotherly countries. Today, just as the aggressive bloc headed by US imperialism is still expanding its military and preparing for war and carrying out atomic blackmail, the Soviet people, with their strong national defense forces, are joining the people of the world to defend peace. The great Soviet Union is the center of the international workers' movement and a strong fortress for maintaining world peace.

    II. In Czechoslovakia
    On December 2, 1956, the delegation arrived in Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, from Moscow.
    Czechoslovakia has a relatively high level of industrial development. Their machinery industry is particularly developed, and the output value of the machinery industry accounts for about 28% of the total industrial output value. They manufacture industrial equipment for many countries. We visited the Stalingrad Factory in Prague, which mainly produces electrical machinery and steam turbines. We visited the Lenin United Factory in Pilsen, which is a factory that manufactures various heavy machinery. It was deliberately destroyed by the United States on the eve of liberation in 1945. Less than a year after liberation, it resumed production, and the production level at the end of 1953 had increased to three times that of pre-war. When we visited, they were manufacturing turbines, coal mining machines, ammonium nitrate plant equipment, and 6,000-ton hydraulic presses for China. In Ostrava, the steel capital of Czechoslovakia, we visited the large-scale Gottwald United Steel Plant. Czechoslovakia produced 4.47 million tons of steel in 1955. Calculated by population, the steel production is very high. We also visited the Tatra Automobile Factory in Ostrava. This factory has successfully trial-produced a high-speed automobile that can travel 180 kilometers per hour. Czechoslovakia has an area of 128,000 square kilometers, with more than 13,000 kilometers of railways and 120,000 kilometers of highways. The transportation is quite developed.
    Czechoslovakia's light industry is also developed. We visited the Light Shoe Factory in Gottwaldov, which is modernly equipped and can produce more than 30 million pairs of shoes every year. We visited the Pilsen Brewery, which has a cold storage of nine kilometers long. In Karlovy Vary, a famous scenic and sanatorium area, we visited the Moser Glass Factory, whose products are exquisitely carved and are a world-famous art glass products factory. The products of these factories are sold to 60 to 70 countries.
    Before the war, in 1937, although Czechoslovakia's industrial output value accounted for 57% of the total industrial and agricultural output value, it was mainly light industry, and it was not economically free from the constraints of Western capitalist countries. After the February Revolution of 1948, after seven years of effort, by 1955, the industrial output value had reached more than 80% of the total industrial and agricultural output value. Among them, the output value of production materials accounted for 62.2%. Their foreign trade, especially trade with brotherly countries, is very developed.
    In the suburbs of Prague, we visited the Czech-Chinese Friendship Cooperative in Vinazitz and the Zlobice Agricultural Cooperative in Sedocian County. About 50% of the farmers in Czechoslovakia have joined agricultural cooperatives, and the cultivated land area of the cooperatives accounts for 39% of the country's cultivated land area, and the cultivated land area of state-owned farms accounts for 11% of the country's cultivated land area. Because they have a modern industry as a foundation, they can not only use machines for farming in agricultural production, but also have more chemical fertilizers, so the yield per unit area in Czechoslovakia is also relatively high.
    Because Czechoslovakia has a relatively high degree of industrialization, the people's lives are also relatively good. During the first five-year plan (1949-1953), wages increased by about 34%. In 1955, the average monthly wage of workers in the industrial sector was 1,300 crowns. The people's purchasing power is quite high. Czechoslovakia's cultural and educational undertakings have also developed greatly, and eight-year compulsory education has been implemented. In 1955, there were 49,000 students studying in 40 universities. Illiteracy has been basically eliminated. There are now about 300 scientific research institutions in Czechoslovakia.
    We visited Bratislava, the capital of the Slovak national region. The Slovak national region has its own national parliament and administrative committee. Before liberation, this region was relatively backward; after liberation, industry and culture are developing rapidly, and many new factories have been built. There we visited the Peace Rayon Factory, which is relatively large in scale. We also visited the Forestry Research Institute and Bratislava University. Under the socialist system, this region has changed its past backwardness.
    In addition to the Communist Party, there are also the Socialist Party, the People's Party, the Slovak Revival Party, and the Slovak Freedom Party in Czechoslovakia. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, these parties and people's organizations formed a national front that united people from all walks of life across the country.
    During the visit, we had cordial conversations with comrades such as Czechoslovak President Zapotocky, National Assembly Chairman Fierlinger, Prime Minister Siroky, First Secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Novotny, and other leading comrades of the parliament, the government, and the party, as well as many working comrades from various fields. The delegation attended a meeting of the Czechoslovak National Assembly, and the delegation was warmly welcomed by all the deputies. In Bratislava, we were warmly received by the leading comrades from all aspects of Slovakia. At the farewell banquet, Comrade Gubach, the more than 70-year-old chairman of the National Assembly, enthusiastically danced with the members of our delegation. Such profound friendship and the enthusiastic welcome of the people deeply made us feel the fraternal close relationship between the Czechoslovak people and the Chinese people.

    III. In Romania
    The delegation arrived in Romania on December 22, 1956, and was warmly welcomed at the Iasi station on the border and in Bucharest, the capital of Romania.
    We visited the Mao Zedong Factory in Bucharest. This is a machine factory that once manufactured boilers and assembled buses for power plants for China. We also visited the Spark Building printing enterprise, the Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej clothing factory, the Institute of Endocrinology, the National Museum, etc.
    Romania produces 11 million tons of oil per year, which is a great wealth for the country. We visited the Ploiesti No. 1 Refinery, which was originally controlled by British and Dutch imperialists. It was developed after being nationalized in 1948. It can now process more than 9,500 tons of crude oil per day, accounting for 28% of the country's crude oil production; it now produces more than 130 kinds of products such as gasoline and white spirit, which is more than double the number of products before liberation. In Ploiesti, we also visited the "May 1" Oil Equipment Factory, which can manufacture various drilling rigs and refining machines. In this factory, we saw Romanian worker brothers enthusiastically manufacturing drilling rigs for us.
    We visited the Telmann Tractor Factory in Stalin City. Before liberation, this factory originally manufactured military aircraft, but after liberation, it was changed to peaceful production. This factory manufactured more than 1,000 tractors for China last year. The workers completed the production tasks ahead of schedule, expressing their friendship to the Chinese people.
    Romania has abundant forests, accounting for 25.8% of the country's area and 66% of the agricultural and forestry management area, mostly coniferous trees with high economic value. This is Romania's great wealth. These forests not only play a great role in regulating the climate, but also add many scenic spots to the entire country.
    Romania has about 1.6 million Hungarian people. We visited Targu Mures, the capital of the Hungarian Autonomous Region. In addition to the Hungarian ethnic group, this autonomous region also has German, Jewish, and other ethnic groups. This autonomous region has abundant forests and underground resources, but before liberation, there were only more than 30 factories. Now there are more than 200 factories. Before liberation, there were no universities here, but now there are two universities. We visited the Medical College and the Palace of Culture and the museum. After the Hungarian incident, the Hungarian people here once gathered to condemn the subversive activities of imperialists and counter-revolutionaries in Hungary, and firmly supported the position and measures of the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government.
    Romania was originally an industrially backward country. After liberation, industry has developed greatly.
    From 1948 to 1955, more than 100 new industrial enterprises were built, and more than 200 industrial enterprises were renovated and expanded. About 60% of the machines equipped in various departments of the national economy are manufactured in the country. Tractors and oil drilling equipment can be exported in addition to self-sufficiency. In 1955, the industrial output value accounted for 64.6% of the total industrial and agricultural output value. In terms of agricultural cooperation, by June 30, 1956, the number of farmers participating in different forms of agricultural production cooperative organizations had reached 21.5% of the total number of farmers. Romania has fertile land and is known as the granary of Europe. In 1955, grain production was about 12 million tons, and the country has an average of more than 1,300 jin of grain per person per year. After liberation, people's lives have improved. In 1955, the actual wages of workers increased by 8% compared with 1954, and the income of farmers also increased by 15% compared with 1954. Cultural and educational undertakings have also developed. Illiteracy has been basically eliminated nationwide, and universal compulsory education is transitioning from a four-year system to a seven-year system. There are 75,000 college students nationwide, more than double the number in 1939.
    Dr. Groza, Chairman of the Presidium of the Romanian Grand National Assembly, met with us despite his illness. Comrades such as Prime Minister Stoica and First Secretary of the Workers' Party Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej and other leading comrades of the parliament, the government, and the party, as well as many working comrades from various fields, had cordial conversations with us and introduced the situation in Romania's political and economic aspects. Just during our visit, the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party decided to further develop agriculture and consumer goods industry while continuing to develop the means of production industry, and adjust the proportion of accumulation funds and consumption funds. The planned accumulation funds for 1957 were reduced from 23% to 15% of the national income, and the consumption funds were increased from 77% to 85% of the national income. Starting from November 1, 1956, the government also increased the minimum wage in various production departments, and also increased the minimum amount of pensions. In terms of food, it was decided to abolish the mandatory sales system and implement purchases at market prices.
    The Romanian people, under the leadership of the Romanian Workers' Party, are actively carrying out socialist construction.
    In Romania, our hearts were full of warmth and joy. In Sinaia, a famous scenic area, we spent Christmas very happily with Romanian comrades. The members of the Romanian National Assembly spent New Year's Eve 1956 with us. The welcome of the Romanian people to the delegation was very touching, and we will remember this friendship for a long time.

    IV. In Bulgaria
    On January 2, 1957, Klisurski, Vice Chairman of the Presidium of the Bulgarian National Assembly, and other responsible comrades personally took a special train to Bucharest to meet the delegation. The delegation crossed the Danube River and arrived at the Ruse station on the Bulgarian border. It was snowing that day, and the welcoming crowd was really like a sea of people. The next day, we arrived in the capital, Sofia. As soon as we got out of the station, the streets were crowded with welcoming crowds, and we were like in a carnival. The moving enthusiasm of the Bulgarian people for us fully demonstrated the deep friendship and internationalist spirit towards the Chinese people.
    We visited the Stalin Hydroelectric Hub and the Borovets resort area near Sofia. This hydroelectric hub includes the Stalin Reservoir with a storage capacity of 700 million cubic meters, two dikes, three hydroelectric power stations, and a series of irrigation canals. In Plovdiv, the center of handicrafts and commerce, we visited the Stalin Tobacco Factory, the Maritza Textile Factory, the museum, the Vassil Kolarov Higher Agricultural Institute, and the Bréstovitsa Village Newborn Agricultural Cooperative. Plovdiv has about 150 handicraft production cooperatives. We visited the Stolarski Furniture Handicraft Cooperative and the May 1 Sewing Handicraft Cooperative. The income of the members is similar to that of the workers in state-owned enterprises. We also visited Dimitrovgrad, which was only built in 1947. This is a new city built by young people from a wasteland. Most of the residents are young people who responded to the Party's call to participate in construction. Everywhere is full of vibrant youth. Here, we visited the Stalin Chemical United Factory, the Balkan Cement Factory, the Asbestos Cement Factory, and the Maritza Third Thermal Power Station.
    We had cordial conversations with comrades such as Damyanov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Bulgarian National Assembly, Kozovski, Chairman of the Executive Bureau of the National Assembly, Yugov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Zhivkov, First Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party, and other leading comrades of the parliament, the government, and the party, as well as many working comrades. We learned about many aspects of Bulgaria's work in parliament, municipal administration, trade unions, agriculture, women, and ethnic groups.
    Before liberation, Bulgaria was a backward agricultural country. After liberation, the Bulgarian people, under the leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party, rapidly developed socialist industry. By the end of 1955, industrial production had increased more than five times compared with 1939, and the industrial output value accounted for 72% of the total industrial and agricultural output value. In the process of developing industry, they focused on developing the chemical industry and agricultural machinery manufacturing industry related to agricultural production. The industry newly built after liberation was built with the help of the Soviet Union, and the equipment is relatively new.
    Bulgaria's achievements on the agricultural front are also great. Currently, about 950,000 farmers have joined agricultural cooperatives, accounting for about 80% of the total number of farmers, and the cultivated land area of the cooperatives is about 36 million dekars (one dekar is equal to 1.5 mu), accounting for about 80% of the total cultivated land area. Most of the existing agricultural cooperatives are semi-socialist in nature, and they are preparing to gradually reduce and abolish land remuneration. There are more than 180 tractor stations in the country, and the degree of agricultural mechanization has reached more than 70%. After liberation, they actively built reservoirs to accumulate mountain water and irrigate farmland. The larger reservoirs that have been built are the Stalin Reservoir and the Dimitrov Reservoir, and more than 600 small reservoirs have been built. By the end of 1955, the irrigated area had reached 3.6 million dekars.
    After liberation, on the basis of production development, the material and cultural living standards of the people are gradually improving. In 1956, the state's expenditure on cultural, educational, and health undertakings accounted for 23% of the total expenditure. Seven-year compulsory education has now been universally implemented, and illiteracy among people under the age of 50 has been basically eliminated. People's reading rooms play an important role in the cultural life of the Bulgarian people, and they have a long history. There are now more than 4,000 people's reading rooms in the country, with more than 6,000 amateur art groups attached.
    During the years of the anti-fascist war, the Bulgarian people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, formed the Fatherland Front and carried out a heroic struggle against the fascist invaders. After liberation, the Fatherland Front united people from all walks of life across the country and victoriously carried out socialist construction with selfless labor.

    V. In Albania
    The delegation arrived in Tirana, the capital of Albania, by plane from Sofia on January 11, 1957. The Albanian people welcomed us by holding palm leaves symbolizing victory and wearing colorful national costumes.
    The Albanian nation is a strong nation, and they waged a heroic struggle against the German and Italian fascist invaders for national independence and freedom. Under the favorable situation of the Soviet army's offensive against the fascist troops occupying the Balkans, the Albanian people relied on their own armed forces to liberate the entire territory. After liberation, they actively carried out socialist construction with selfless labor.
    Before liberation, Albania was a backward agricultural country with no modern industry. After liberation, under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party and the People's Government, and with the assistance of the Soviet Union, industry was established and developed. By the end of 1955, when the first five-year plan was completed, the industrial output value had increased more than ten times compared with pre-war, accounting for 43.5% of the total industrial and agricultural output value. The increase in Albania's electricity is relatively fast. The electricity produced in nine days now is equal to the total electricity production in the whole year of 1938. The oil industry is now Albania's main industry. We visited two oil refineries, and the output has increased more than four times compared with pre-war. Before liberation, there was not a single modern textile factory in the country. In 1951, the Stalin Textile United Factory was built in Tirana. It now has about 4,000 employees and produces about 20 million meters of cotton cloth and 1 million meters of woolen products annually. In addition, we also visited cement factories, cannery factories, cigarette factories, and hydroelectric power stations under construction. The equipment in these factories is modern.
    After liberation, Albania's agricultural production also achieved great development. The sown area expanded by about 70%, and grain output increased by more than 60%. The number of farmers who have joined cooperatives and their cultivated land area have reached about 30% of the national total.
    Due to the development of industrial and agricultural production, the national income increased by 70% from 1951 to 1956. In 1956, the income in the national budget from the socialist economic sector accounted for 71%.
    On the basis of the development of industrial and agricultural production, people's lives have improved. During the first five-year plan from 1951 to 1955, workers' wages increased by 32%, and farmers' incomes increased by 35%. Cultural and educational undertakings have also developed. Before liberation, there was not a single university in the country. Now there are six. Illiteracy among people under the age of 40 has also been eliminated.
    During our visit, Comrade Leshi, Chairman of the Presidium of the Albanian People's Assembly, Comrade Marko, Chairman of the People's Assembly, Comrade Shehu, Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and many other leading comrades of the parliament, the government, and the party, as well as many working comrades from various fields, had cordial conversations with us. When we visited Tirana, Shkodër, Vlorë, Durrës, Stalin City, Selenica, and other places, and when we visited factories, farms, cultural and educational institutions, we were warmly welcomed and cordially received by local leading comrades and the masses.
    Wherever we went, we could hear them singing the songs that the Chinese people love to sing, and we met Albanian friends who had been to China. We cannot forget that in Shkodër, the local hunters specially hunted pheasants on the mountain for the distant guests; many villagers dressed in festive costumes and enthusiastically welcomed us. The Albanian people's friendship with the Chinese people is deep.

    VI. In Yugoslavia
    On January 17, 1957, we arrived in Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia, by plane.
    The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has six republics. We visited four republics: Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Slovenia. In the capital, Belgrade, we met with comrades such as Federal President Tito, National Assembly President Pijade, Executive Committee Vice President Kardelj, and Ranković, and also with the Federal National Assembly, the Executive Committee, the Belgrade City People's Committee, the parliaments and governments of the four republics, party and other responsible comrades, and many working comrades.

    The Yugoslav Federal National Assembly is composed of the Federal Council and the Council of Producers. The two houses now have 554 members. The Federal Council has 352 members, of which 282 members are elected from the 282 electoral districts divided across the country. The remaining 70 members are elected from among their members by the parliaments of the republics, autonomous provinces, and autonomous regions. These 70 members can form the National Council to hold separate meetings when discussing ethnic issues. The Council of Producers currently has 202 members, who are elected by the employees of production units such as industry and mining, commerce, transportation, handicrafts, farms, and members of agricultural cooperatives. Among them, 67 are representatives of agriculture, and 135 are representatives of industry and mining, commerce, transportation, and other fields. The two houses have equal rights in amending the constitution, approving the federal economic plan and budget, and formulating general laws. The power to elect and remove the Federal President, members of the Executive Committee, the Chairman and Vice-Chairmen and Secretary of the National Assembly, and judges of the Supreme Court is exercised by a joint meeting of the two houses. The Council of Producers can make suggestions to economic units, can make suggestions to government agencies and autonomous agencies on issues related to economic work and social insurance, and can make decisions within the scope of its legally prescribed powers. In addition, other issues that should be handled by the Federal National Assembly are handled separately by the Federal Council.

    Before liberation, Yugoslavia was a backward agricultural country. After liberation, the Yugoslav people overcame various difficulties and developed socialist industry. In 1955, the country's industrial production increased by nearly two times compared with pre-war. Metallurgy, electricity, fuel, shipbuilding, machinery, chemical and other industries have developed. Many new industrial and mining enterprises have been established.
    We visited the Rakovica Mada Factory in Belgrade. In 1956, this factory produced more than 1,300 tractors and more than 1,000 gasoline engines. We visited Zenica, the steel base of Yugoslavia. The steel joint enterprise here now produces more than 500,000 tons of steel annually, and about 600,000 tons of coking coal and pig iron each. It is still being expanded. In Zagreb, the capital of the Republic of Croatia, the second largest city in Yugoslavia, we visited the Lada Koncar electrical equipment factory. The factory's engines, transformers, and turbines can be exported in addition to self-sufficiency.
    Factories in Yugoslavia implement a "worker collective management" system.
    For example, in the case of the Rakovica Mada Factory we visited, the factory now has more than 1,500 employees, who elected 65 representatives to form a workers' council. According to the law, major issues of the factory, such as formulating production plans, labor quotas, wage standards, and reward methods, are decided by the workers' council. The workers' council elects 11 people to form a management committee as its executive body. The factory director is a natural member of the management committee. The candidates for factory director are decided by a special committee jointly composed of the local people's committee and the factory's workers' council, and are approved and appointed by the local people's committee. The workers' council and the management committee do not have full-time offices and staff, and the members are part-time. Factories formulate their own production plans according to their own production capacity and market needs, independently operate their businesses, purchase raw materials and promote their products themselves, and freely compete with their peers. Factories pay the state interest on fixed assets and working capital at an annual rate of 6%. 50% of the factory's profits are turned over to the federal government; 40% are turned over to the county people's committee for the republic and county to distribute; the remaining 10% is retained by the factory; of which 5% is used as employee bonuses and 5% is used for building employee housing and other employee welfare projects. The factory is responsible for its own profits and losses. When the factory loses money, the workers' council has the right to make a decision to reduce the wages of employees. In Yugoslavia, the state does not issue production targets to enterprises, and each enterprise formulates its own production plan according to its own production capacity and market needs. As for how they combine the plans of enterprises with the national overall plan ("social plan") to prevent the anarchy of production and realize the socialist planned economy, we did not have time to conduct a systematic study during our visit.
    We visited the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, which is the main agricultural area of Yugoslavia and also a region with developed agricultural production. Its commodity grain accounts for about 60% of the total grain output. We visited the Bečejes Agricultural Labor Cooperative and the "Friendship and Unity

    中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会代表团访问苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚、南斯拉夫的报告
    ——1957年3月31日在全国人民代表大会常务委员会的扩大会议上
    全国人民代表大会代表团团长　彭真主席、各位委员、各位同志：
    全国人民代表大会代表团接受了苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚和南斯拉夫六个国家的邀请，进行了友好的访问。从1956年11月15日出国到1957年2月1日回国，历时七十九天，我们去的时候正是严寒的冬天，但是无论走到哪里，热烈欢迎和亲切的款待使我们感觉到比春天还温暖。代表团所到的地方，那里千千万万兄弟姐妹穿着节日的盛装，向我们夹道欢呼，把我们看成从远道而来的亲戚和朋友，称我们为“亲兄弟”。他们在北方冰天雪地里用鲜花来迎接我们，他们在南方用碧绿的棕榈树叶来欢迎我们。我们沿途时常听见为欢迎代表团而奏的中国音乐，看见为欢迎代表团而悬挂的中国国旗，在不少的地方，连欢迎的标语也是用中国文字写的。他们称呼我们是“伟大的中国人民的使者”。
    我们同这些兄弟国家的议会、政府、党和群众团体的领导同志们和各方面的工作同志们进行了亲切的谈话，同很多群众见了面。我们访问了许多美丽的城市和乡村，参观了许多规模宏大的工厂、农庄、学校、科学文化机关和市政设施。这些社会主义的建设充分证明了在共产党、工人党、劳动党和政府的领导下，这些兄弟国家的人民高度地发挥了他们的勤劳、勇敢和智慧。他们满怀信心，生气勃勃地进行着社会主义建设。无论是在工业、农业、科学文化教育事业上，他们都已经取得了辉煌的成就。在发展生产的基础上，人民的物质、文化生活的水平显然是提高了。在社会主义国家里，人民丰衣足食，永远摆脱了被剥削和失业的痛苦，真正成了国家的主人。
    通过这次访问，我们看见了这些兄弟国家的伟大成就，这些成就充分地显示了社会主义制度的优越性。我们亲身感觉到这些兄弟国家的人民高度的政治觉悟和无产阶级国际主义的精神，感觉到社会主义国家间的深厚友谊和团结。这就是世界和平和人类进步事业的保证，也是永远不可战胜的力量。
    一、在苏联
    代表团在1956年11月15日到达莫斯科，12月2日离开苏联，在这十八天中，我们访问了苏联首都莫斯科，访问了十月革命的摇篮列宁格勒，访问了乌兹别克加盟共和国的首都塔什干。此外，我们还在伊尔库次克、鄂木斯克、第比利斯和基辅作了短时间的逗留；在从捷克斯洛伐克到罗马尼亚的旅途中又在乌克兰和摩尔达维亚过境。不论我们在苏联国土上哪个地方出现，都受到人民群众和领导同志们的热烈欢迎和亲切接待。
    在莫斯科，我们谒列宁斯大林墓，献了花圈。在列宁格勒，我们参观了十月革命武装起义的总部斯莫尔尼宫，参观了拉次列夫的列宁避难所，参观了炮打冬宫光荣起义的“阿芙乐尔号”巡洋舰等列宁的和十月革命的遗迹。
    在访问期间，我们先后同苏联最高苏维埃，莫斯科、列宁格勒市苏维埃，俄罗斯联邦和乌兹别克共和国最高苏维埃，以及一些区和村苏维埃的领导同志们就各级苏维埃的组织情况和工作进行了座谈。在座谈中我们着重地了解了各级苏维埃常设委员会的工作情况。苏联最高苏维埃两院和加盟共和国最高苏维埃都设有代表资格审查、预算、外交、法案等委员会。地方苏维埃的常设委员会比较多，例如莫斯科市苏维埃设有十二个常设委员会，列宁格勒市苏维埃设有十三个常设委员会（工业、预算、基本建设、国民教育、保健、文化、城市运输和邮电、公用事业和改进城市设施、住宅、煤气和暖气、商业和公共食堂、社会保障、建筑材料等委员会），莫斯科市红色普勒斯尼亚区苏维埃设有八个常设委员会，塔什干州奥尔忠尼启则区杜尔曼村苏维埃设有六个常设委员会。常设委员会的主要任务是协助苏维埃和它的执行机关实现苏维埃的决议，并且监督和检查决议的执行情况，向苏维埃和它的执行机关反映选民的意见。常设委员会是由苏维埃选举一定数目的代表组成的，根据工作的需要，它可以吸收专家和居民中的积极分子参加工作。例如，列宁格勒市苏维埃的十三个常设委员会共有代表二百十九人和专家、积极分子一千五百人参加工作。在座谈中，我们了解了常设委员会在监督和检查苏维埃执行机关工作方面的一些具体情况。例如，莫斯科市苏维埃商业和公共食堂常设委员会曾经检查了食品商店储藏食品的情况，把发现的缺点，提交市苏维埃执行委员会讨论，并且由市苏维埃执行委员会作出了改进工作的决议，教育和处分了有关的失职人员，改进了工作。在我们访问过的其他兄弟国家的议会也都设有若干常设委员会，它的作用同苏联的有些相同。
    在莫斯科我们参观了原子能发电站和飞机制造厂等企业。在列宁格勒我们参观了基洛夫电机厂、光学仪器厂、快速皮鞋厂、米高扬制糖厂等企业。在塔什干我们参观了联合纺织厂。这些工厂，都拥有现代化的技术设备，同时，在增产节约、提高劳动生产率、提高产品质量、降低成本，特别是在减少非直接生产人员方面，有许多先进的经验。
    十月革命后，苏联人民在苏联共产党的领导下，战胜了各种困难，以人类历史上空前的速度完成了社会主义的工业化，建设起自己的独立的工业体系，取得了伟大的成就。1955年工业的总产量比1929年增加了二十多倍。这个铁一般的事实充分显示了社会主义制度的优越性。
    近年来苏联在垦荒方面，也取得了显著的成就。从1954年到1956年底，开垦了生熟荒地三千五百五十万公顷，超额完成原定计划的两倍。此外，并且推广了玉米等高产作物。因此，1956年全国收购了三十三亿普特以上的谷物，比过去几年有很大的增加（在过去几年中，全国每年收购约二十亿到二十二亿普特，每一普特合中国三二·七六市斤）。这不但保证了人民的需要，而且增加了粮食的储备。1956年棉花的产量也有增加。我们访问的乌兹别克共和国是苏联的产棉区，它的产量占全苏联棉花产量的三分之二。1956年乌兹别克共和国向国家交售二百八十六万吨棉花，比1955年的交售量约多四十万吨。乌兹别克共和国的棉花单位面积产量是比较高的。例如，在塔什干州奥尔忠尼启则区的五千九百三十八公顷棉田中，每公顷的收获量是三十八点七公担。十月革命前的乌兹别克经济和文化都是落后的。十月革命后乌兹别克发展了工业、农业和科学技术，发展了水利灌溉事业，逐步把沙漠变成良田，从而改变了过去的落后面貌，现在已经成为一个先进的工业和农业的地区。
    随着工业农业生产的不断高涨，苏联人民的生活水平也正在继续提高。苏联没有像资本主义国家存在的失业问题。职工的工作时间已经缩短，工资正在进一步调整，提高低工资，缩短高低工资间的距离。农民的生活也提高了。年老不能劳动者和残废者的生活都得到了照顾。
    我们在莫斯科参观了莫斯科大学、国际关系学院、全苏农业、工业展览会、画廊等，在列宁格勒参观了列宁格勒大学、全苏植物保护研究所、森林工程学院、普尔科夫天文台、冬宫博物馆，在塔什干参观了乌兹别克共和国科学院等文化科学机关。我们看到了苏联科学研究的一些规模和成就，看到了原子能在工业和农业等方面的广泛利用。苏联重视科学人材的培养，科学人材是众多的。苏联大力进行科学研究工作，有许多科学部门走在世界各国的前面。
    在访问期间，我们曾经同苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫、最高苏维埃联盟院主席洛巴诺夫、民族院主席拉齐斯、部长会议主席布尔加宁、苏联共产党第一书记赫鲁晓夫等同志和议会、政府、党的其他领导同志们，俄罗斯联邦共和国、乌兹别克共和国、莫斯科、列宁格勒市的领导同志们和其他许多工作同志们进行了亲切的交谈。我们在莫斯科圆柱大厅会见了热情的各界劳动人民。我们在工厂，受到了无数苏联工人弟兄的欢迎。在农村，得到了许多庄员对我们家人一般的款待。在学校、在少年宫和其他文化机构的同志们对我们也是同样亲切和热情。这些朋友们有的正在全力地为中国制造机器，有的正在帮助我们的工作人员进行实习，有的正在培养我们的留学生。我们到处看见的是友谊、合作和苏联人民对中国人民弟兄般的感情。中苏两国人民的友谊是永恒的，牢不可破的。
    我们在访问期间，亲眼看到苏联人民在苏联共产党和苏联政府的领导下所取得的辉煌成就，无可争辩地证明十月革命的道路是光辉的道路。苏联人民的革命经验和社会主义建设经验是极为丰富的，它过去和今后都鼓舞着全世界的无产阶级和进步人类，为了和平、民主和社会主义的胜利而进行斗争。苏联人民在第二次大战中挽救了人类免于法西斯的奴役，战后又进行了规模巨大的建设，对兄弟国家给予巨大的援助和支持。今天，正当以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团还在扩军备战，进行原子讹诈的时候，苏联人民又以强大的国防力量，和全世界的人民一起，保卫着和平。伟大的苏联是国际工人运动的中心，是维护世界和平的坚强堡垒。
    二、在捷克斯洛伐克
    1956年12月2日，代表团从莫斯科到达捷克斯洛伐克首都布拉格。
    捷克斯洛伐克工业发展的水平是比较高的。他们的机械工业特别发达，机械工业的产值占全部工业总产值的约28％。他们给许多国家制造工业装备。我们在布拉格参观了斯大林格勒工厂，这个工厂主要是生产电力机械和汽轮机等。我们在比尔森参观了列宁联合工厂，这是一个制造各种重型机器的工厂，1945年解放前夕，曾经被美国故意炸毁，解放后不到一年，就恢复了生产，1953年底的生产水平已经提高到战前的三倍。在我们参观的时候他们正在为中国制造透平、采煤机、硝酸錏厂的设备和六千吨的水压机等。我们在捷克斯洛伐克的钢都奥斯特拉伐，参观了规模宏大的哥特瓦尔德联合钢铁厂。捷克斯洛伐克1955年产钢四百四十七万吨，按人口比例计算，钢的产量是很高的。我们在奥斯特拉伐还参观了塔特拉汽车厂，这个厂已经试制成功一种高速度的汽车，每小时可以行驶一百八十公里。捷克斯洛伐克面积是十二万八千平方公里，全国有铁路一万三千多公里，公路十二万公里，交通运输相当发达。
    捷克斯洛伐克的轻工业也是发达的。我们在哥特瓦尔多夫参观了光明鞋厂，设备是现代化的，每年可生产三千多万双鞋子。我们参观了比尔森啤酒工厂，这个工厂有长达九公里的冷藏库。在著名的风景区和疗养区卡罗维瓦里，我们参观了莫索尔玻璃工厂，产品雕刻细致，是一个世界闻名的艺术玻璃制品工厂。这些工厂的产品销售到六、七十个国家。
    战前，1937年捷克斯洛伐克的工业产值虽然占工农业总产值的57％，但是主要是轻工业，并且在经济上没有脱离西方资本主义国家的束缚。1948年2月革命后，过去七年的努力，到1955年，工业产值已经达到工农业总产值的80％以上。其中，生产资料产值占62.2％。他们的对外贸易特别是同兄弟国家的贸易很发达。
    在布拉格近郊，我们参观了维纳尔日采村的捷中友谊合作社和赛多强尼县的兹洛维基采农业合作社。捷克斯洛伐克全国参加农业合作社的社员约占农民总数的50％，合作社的耕地面积占全国耕地面积的39％，国营农场的耕地面积占全国耕地面积的11％。由于他们有现代化的工业作基础，在农业生产上不仅能够用机械进行耕作，而且有比较多的化学肥料，所以捷克斯洛伐克的单位面积产量也比较高。
    因为捷克斯洛伐克工业化的程度比较高，所以人民生活也比较好。在第一个五年计划期间
  （1949—1953年）工资增加了约34％。1955年工业部门的职工平均工资每月为一千三百克郎。人民的购买力是相当高的。捷克斯洛伐克的文化教育事业也有较大的发展，已经实行了八年制普及义务教育。1955年在四十所高等学校里学习的学生有四万九千人。文盲已经基本消灭。现在捷克斯洛伐克全国共有三百个左右的科学研究机关。
    我们访问了斯洛伐克民族地区的首府布拉基斯拉伐。斯洛伐克民族地区有自己的民族议会和行政委员会。解放前，这个地区是比较落后的；解放后，工业和文化正在迅速地发展，新建了许多工厂。在那里我们参观了和平人造丝工厂，规模是比较大的。我们还参观了林业研究所和布拉基斯拉伐大学。在社会主义制度下，这个地区已经改变了它过去的落后面貌。
    捷克斯洛伐克除共产党以外，还有社会党、人民党、斯洛伐克复兴党和斯洛伐克自由党。在共产党领导下由这些党派和各人民团体组成了团结全国各阶层人民的民族阵线。
    在访问期间，我们曾经同捷克斯洛伐克共和国总统萨波托斯基、国民议会主席费林格、总理西罗基、捷克斯洛伐克共产党第一书记诺沃提尼等同志和议会、政府、党的其他领导同志们、还有各方面的许多工作同志们进行了亲切的交谈。代表团出席了捷克斯洛伐克国民议会的一次会议，代表团受到全体议员的热烈欢迎。在布拉基斯拉伐，受到斯洛伐克各方面的领导同志的热情招待。在临别的宴会上，七十多岁的民族议会主席古巴奇同志热情洋溢地和我们代表团的团员们一同跳起舞来。这样的隆情厚谊和人民群众对我们的热烈欢迎，使我们深深感到捷克斯洛伐克人民对中国人民兄弟般的亲密关系。
    三、在罗马尼亚
    代表团于1956年12月22日到达罗马尼亚，在边境的雅西车站和罗马尼亚首都布加勒斯特，都受到了热烈欢迎。
    我们在布加勒斯特参观了毛泽东工厂。这是一个机器工厂，曾经为中国制造发电厂用的锅炉和装配公共汽车。我们还参观了印刷企业火花大厦、乔治乌—德治被服厂、内分泌研究所、国家博物馆等。
    罗马尼亚年产一千一百万吨石油，这是这个国家一种极大的财富。我们参观了普鲁也什蒂第一炼油厂，这个厂原来为英、荷帝国主义者所把持，1948年收归国有之后才得到发展，现在每日能处理原油九千五百多吨，占全国原油采量的28％；现在出产汽油、白节油等一百三十多种，比解放前的产品种类多了一倍。在普鲁也什蒂，还参观了“五一”石油设备工厂，这个工厂能够制造各种钻探机和炼油机。在这个工厂里，我们看见罗马尼亚工人兄弟正用高度的热情为我们制造钻探机。
    我们在斯大林城参观了台尔曼拖拉机工厂。这个工厂在解放以前，本来是制造军用飞机的，解放后，改成了和平生产。这个工厂，在去年，就为中国制造了一千多辆拖拉机。工人们提前完成生产任务，表示对中国人民的友谊。
    罗马尼亚有丰富的森林，占全国面积的25.8％，占农林经营面积的66％，多为有高度经济价值的针叶树。这是罗马尼亚的巨大财富。这些森林不但对于调节气候起了很大作用，而且使整个国家增加了许多名胜地区。
    罗马尼亚约有一百六十万匈牙利族人民，我们访问了匈牙利民族自治州的首府特尔古·穆列斯。这个自治区，除匈牙利族以外，还有日尔曼、犹太等民族。这个自治区，有丰富的森林和地下资源，但在解放前只有工厂三十多个，现在已经有二百多个工厂。解放前，这里没有高等学校，现在已经有两所高等学校。我们参观了医药学院，并且参观了文化宫和博物馆等。在匈牙利事件发生以后，这里的匈牙利族人民曾经集会谴责帝国主义和反革命分子在匈牙利的颠复活动，坚决支持匈牙利工农革命政府的立场和措施。
    罗马尼亚原来是工业落后的国家。解放后，工业有很大的发展。
    从1948年到1955年新建了工业企业一百多个，改建和扩建了工业企业二百多个。国民经济各部门装备的机器约有60％以上是由本国制造的。拖拉机和石油钻探设备除自给外，还可以出口。1955年的工业产值，已占工农业总产值的64.6％。在农业合作化方面，到1956年6月30日止，参加不同形式的农业生产合作组织的农户已经达到农户总数的21.5％。罗马尼亚土地肥沃，被称为欧洲的粮仓，1955年谷物产量约达一千二百万吨，全国每人每年平均有粮食一千三百多斤。解放后，人民生活已经有了改善。1955年职工的实际工资较1954年增加8％，农民的收入也比1954年增加15％。文化教育事业也有了发展。全国文盲已经基本上消灭，普及义务教育制正在由四年制过渡到七年制。全国有大学生七万五千人，比1939年增加了一倍多。
    罗马尼亚大国民议会主席团主席格罗查博士抱病接见了我们，部长会议主席斯托伊卡、工人党第一书记乔治乌—德治等同志和议会、政府、党的其他领导同志们和各方面的许多工作同志们同我们进行了亲切的交谈，介绍了罗马尼亚政治经济等方面的情况。正当我们访问期间，罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会决定在继续发展生产资料工业的同时，进一步发展农业和消费品工业，调整积累资金和消费资金的比例。1957年的计划积累资金由原来占国民收入的23％减为15％，消费资金由原来占国民收入的77％增为85％。从1956年11月1日开始，政府又提高了各生产部门的最低工资额，同时还提高了抚恤金的最低定额。在粮食方面，决定取消义务交售制，实行按市价收购。
    罗马尼亚人民在罗马尼亚工人党的领导下，正在积极地进行社会主义建设。
    在罗马尼亚，我们心里充满了温暖和喜悦。在著名的风景区西那亚我们和罗马尼亚的同志们非常愉快地度过了圣诞节。罗马尼亚的国民议会议员们和我们一同欢度1956年除夕。罗马尼亚人民对代表团的欢迎是十分感人的，我们将长久记得这样的友谊。
    四、在保加利亚
    1957年1月2日，保加利亚国民议会主席团副主席克利苏尔斯基和其他负责同志亲自坐了专车到布加勒斯特来迎接代表团。代表团渡过多瑙河，到达保加利亚边境的车站鲁赛。那天下着雪，欢迎的群众真是像人山人海。第二天到达首都索非亚，一出车站，街道上挤满了欢迎的群众，我们像处在一个狂欢的节日里。保加利亚人民对我们这样动人的热情，充分表现了对中国人民深厚的友谊和国际主义的精神。
    我们参观了索非亚附近的斯大林水力枢纽和勃罗维茨休养区。这个水力枢纽包括蓄水量七亿立方公尺的斯大林水库、两条堤坝、三个水力发电站和一系列灌溉渠道。我们在手工业商业中心普洛夫迪夫参观了斯大林烟草工厂、马里查纺织工厂，参观了博物馆、瓦西尔·科拉罗夫高等农业学院和布列斯托维查村新生农业合作社。普洛夫迪夫约有一百五十个手工业生产合作社，我们参观的斯托拉尔斯基家具手工业合作社和五一缝纫手工业合作社，社员的收入和国营企业工人的收入相近。我们又访问了在1947年才兴建的季米特洛夫格勒，这是由青年们从一片荒地上建设起来的新城，居民大部分是响应党的号召到那里去参加建设的青年，到处是朝气勃勃的青春气象。在这里，我们参观了斯大林化学联合工厂、巴尔干水泥厂、石棉水泥工厂和马利查第三热力发电站。
    我们同保加利亚国民议会主席团主席达米扬诺夫、国民议会执行局主席科佐夫斯基、部长会议主席于哥夫、保加利亚共产党第一书记日夫科夫等同志和议会、政府、党的其他领导同志们，还有许多工作同志们，进行了亲切的交谈，了解了保加利亚在议会、市政、工会、农业、妇女、民族等方面的许多工作情况。
    保加利亚在解放前是一个落后的农业国。解放以后保加利亚人民在保加利亚共产党的领导下，迅速地发展了社会主义的工业。到1955年底，工业生产已经比1939年增加了五倍多，工业产值占工农业总产值的72％。在发展工业过程中，他们着重发展了与农业生产有关的化学工业和农业机器制造业。解放后新建的工业是在苏联的帮助下建设起来的，设备比较新。
    在农业战线上，保加利亚的成就也是大的。目前加入农业合作社的农户约九十五万户，约占农户总数的80％，合作社的耕地面积约有三千六百万代克（一代克等于一点五华亩），约占耕地总面积的80％。现有的农业合作社大部分是半社会主义性质的，他们准备逐渐地减低和取消土地报酬。全国现有一百八十多个拖拉机站，农业机械化的程度已经达到70％以上。解放后他们积极建筑水库，积聚山水，灌溉农田。现在已经建成的较大的水库有斯大林水库和季米特洛夫水库，还建造了六百多处小型水库，到1955年底灌溉面积已经达到三百六十万代克。
    解放后，在生产发展的基础上，人民的物质、文化生活的水平在逐渐提高。1956年国家在文教卫生事业中的支出占全部支出的23％。现在已经普遍实行七年制义务教育，五十岁以下的文盲已经基本上消灭。人民读书室在保加利亚人民的文化生活中起着重要的作用，它有悠久的历史。现在全国有四千多个人民读书室，并且附有六千多个业余艺术团体。
    保加利亚人民在反法西斯战争的年代里，在共产党的领导下，结成了祖国阵线，同法西斯侵略者进行了英勇的斗争。在解放后，祖国阵线团结了全国各阶层人民，以忘我的劳动胜利地进行着社会主义的建设。
    五、在阿尔巴尼亚
    代表团在1957年1月11日从索非亚乘飞机到达阿尔巴尼亚首都地拉那。阿尔巴尼亚人民举着象征胜利的棕榈树叶，穿着绚烂多采的民族服装来欢迎我们。
    阿尔巴尼亚民族是坚强的民族，他们为了民族的独立自由，曾经对德意法西斯侵略者进行过英勇的斗争。在苏军进攻侵占巴尔干的法西斯军队的有利形势下，阿尔巴尼亚人民依靠自己的武装力量解放了全部国土。解放后，他们又以忘我的劳动积极地进行社会主义建设。
      解放前，阿尔巴尼亚是一个落后的农业国，没有现代化的工业。解放以后，在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和人民政府的领导下，在苏联的援助下，建立和发展了工业。到1955年底第一个五年计划完成的时候，工业产值比战前增加了十倍以上，占工农业总产值的43.5％。阿尔巴尼亚电力的增加是比较快的，现在九天中生产的电力就等于1938年全年电力生产的总和。石油工业现在是阿尔巴尼亚的主要工业，我们曾经参观了两个炼油厂，产量比战前提高了四倍多。解放前，全国没有一个现代化的纺织厂，1951年在地拉那建成了斯大林纺织联合厂，现在有职工四千人左右，年产棉布约两千万公尺和毛织品一百万公尺。此外，我们还参观了水泥工厂、罐头工厂、卷烟工厂和正在建设中的水电站，这些工厂的设备都是现代化的。
    解放后，阿尔巴尼亚的农业生产也获得了很大的发展，播种面积扩大了70％左右，粮食产量增加了60％以上。现在加入合作社的农户和它的耕地面积都已经达到全国总额的约30％。
    由于工业和农业生产的发展，从1951年到1956年国民收入增加了70％。1956年国家预算中的收入来自社会主义经济部门的占71％。
    在工农业生产发展的基础上，人民生活已经有了改善。1951年到1955年第一个五年计划期间，工人的工资增加了32％，农民收入增加了35％。文化教育事业也有了发展。解放前，全国没有一所高等学校，现在已经有了六所。四十岁以下的文盲也已经消灭。
    在我们访问期间，阿尔巴尼亚人民议会主席团主席列希、人民议会主席马尔科、部长会议主席谢胡等同志和议会、政府、党的其他许多领导同志，还有各方面的许多工作同志，同我们进行了亲切的交谈。我们在访问地拉那、斯库台、发罗拉、都拉斯、斯大林城、塞立克等地方和参观工厂、农庄、文化教育机关的时候，都受到当地领导同志们和群众的热烈欢迎和亲切接待。
    无论我们走到那里，我们都听得见他们唱着中国人民爱唱的歌，遇得见到过中国的阿尔巴尼亚朋友。我们不能忘记在斯库台，当地的猎手们特地为远方的客人到山上打了山鸡；许多村庄的群众都穿戴起节日的盛装，热情地欢迎我们。阿尔巴尼亚人民对中国人民的友谊是深厚的。
    六、在南斯拉夫
    1957年1月17日我们乘飞机到达了南斯拉夫的首都贝尔格莱德。
    南斯拉夫联邦共有六个共和国。我们先后访问了塞尔维亚、克罗地亚、波斯尼亚—黑塞哥维那和斯洛文尼亚四个共和国。在首都贝尔格莱德我们同联邦总统铁托、国民议会主席皮雅杰、执行委员会副主席卡德尔、兰科维奇等同志，并且同联邦国民议会、执行委员会、贝尔格莱德市人民委员会、四个共和国的议会、政府、党和其他方面的负责同志，还有许多工作同志们进行了亲切的交谈。
    南斯拉夫联邦国民议会是由联邦院和生产者院组成的，现在两院共有议员五百五十四名。联邦院有议员三百五十二名，其中二百八十二名是由全国划分的二百八十二个选区分别选出的。其余七十名是由共和国、自治省、自治州的议会在它们的成员中选出的。这七十名议员在讨论民族问题的时候，可以组成民族院单独举行会议。生产者院现有议员二百零二名，是由工矿、商业、运输业、手工业、农场等生产单位的职工和农业合作社的社员选出的。其中六十七名是农业方面的代表，一百三十五名是工矿、商业、运输业等方面的代表。两院在修改宪法、批准联邦经济计划和预算、制定一般法律等方面是有同等权利的。选举和罢免联邦总统、执行委员会委员、国民议会主席、副主席和秘书、最高法院法官等职权，是由两院联席会议行使的。生产者院可以向经济单位提出建议，可以对政府机关和自治机关有关经济工作和社会保险方面的问题提出建议，并且可以在法律规定的职权范围内做出决定。此外，其它应由联邦国民议会处理的问题，统由联邦院单独处理。
    南斯拉夫在解放前是一个落后的农业国，在解放后，南斯拉夫人民克服了各种困难，发展了社会主义的工业。1955年全国工业生产比战前增加了近两倍。冶金、电力、燃料、造船、机器、化学等工业都有了发展。建立了许多新的工矿企业。
    我们参观了贝尔格莱德的拉科维查马达工厂，1956年这个工厂生产了一千三百多台拖拉机、一千多台汽油发动机。我们访问了南斯拉夫钢铁基地泽尼查，这里的钢铁联合企业，现在年产钢五十多万吨，焦煤、生铁各约六十万吨，现在还正在扩建中。在南斯拉夫的第二个大城市克罗地亚共和国首府萨格罗布，我们参观了拉达孔查尔
  电器设备工厂，这个工厂所造的发动机、变压器和透平等设备除自给外，还可以出口。
    南斯拉夫的工厂是实行“工人集体管理”制。
    例如，就我们参观过的拉科维查马达工厂来说，这个厂现在有职工一千五百多人，他们选出六十五名代表组成工人委员会。根据法律规定，凡属工厂的重大问题如制定生产计划、劳动定额、工资标准和奖励办法等都由工人委员会决定。工人委员会选举十一人组成管理委员会作为它的执行机构。厂长是管理委员会的当然委员，厂长的人选，由当地的人民委员会和本厂的工人委员会联合组成的专门委员会决定，由当地的人民委员会批准任命。工人委员会和管理委员会没有专职的办事机构和工作人员，委员是兼职的。工厂根据自己的生产能力和市场的需要各自制定生产计划，独立经营业务，自行采购原料和推销产品并且自由地和同业竞争。工厂每年按6％的利率向国家交纳固定资金和流动资金的利息。工厂利润50％上交联邦政府；40％上交县人民委员会，由共和国和县来支配；其余10％留给工厂；其中5％做为职工红利，5％用于建筑职工住宅和其它职工福利事业。工厂自负盈亏，在工厂赔了钱的时候，工人委员会有权作出决定，减发职工的工资。在南斯拉夫，国家不给企业颁发生产指标，各企业按照自己的生产能力和市场需要，各自制定生产计划。至于他们如何把企业的计划和国家的总计划（“社会计划”）结合起来，以防止生产的无政府状态，实现社会主义的计划经济的问题，我们访问期间没有来得及进行系统的研究。
    我们访问了伏伊伏丁纳自治省，它是南斯拉夫的主要农业区，也是农业生产发达的地区，它的商品粮食约占粮食总产量的60％。我们参观了伏伊伏丁纳自治省首府诺维萨特附近的贝却耶斯农业劳动合作社和“友谊、团结”农场，参观了农业科学研究所和农业机器制造工厂。1956年伏伊伏丁纳自治省有三百四十七个农业劳动生产合作社，二百三十个农场。
    南斯拉夫全国的小学生有一百五十多万，中学生五十多万，大学生将近六万。战前高等学校共有十八所，现在已经有五十八所。全国有三个科学院。文盲已经大部分消灭了。全国工人补习学校约一千九百所。人民的文化水平提高了。在发展生产的基础上，人民的物质生活也有了改善。勤劳勇敢的南斯拉夫人民，现在正在努力发展工业、农业和文化教育事业，进行社会主义建设。
    在访问期间，我们受到南斯拉夫各级领导同志和各方面的工作同志们热情欢迎和亲切接待，他们对中国人民表示了深厚的友谊。
    我们代表团受全国人民代表大会常务委员会的委派到这些兄弟国家进行友好访问，通过这次访问，在进一步加深我国人民同这些兄弟国家人民之间的相互了解、增进友谊和加强团结、学习他们的先进经验等方面都获得了很大的成绩。
    在访问过程中，我们代表团的每一个人都亲身体会到这些兄弟国家的人民对于我国人民是有着深厚友谊的。他们把中国人民革命的胜利看做是自己的胜利，把中国社会主义建设的成就看做是自己的成就。我们所接触的许多同志们，对我国社会主义工业化的发展速度，对我国在短期间基本上完成了农业合作化并且在合作化的基础上所得到的农业生产的成就，对于我国采用和平改造的方法顺利地进行对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，对于我国人民民主统一战线的日益巩固和扩大，都感到很大兴趣。我们这次访问是带着中国六万万人民对这些兄弟国家人民的深厚友谊而去的，也带着这些国家的人民对中国人民的伟大友谊回来了。对于这些兄弟国家的领导同志和人民群众、对于陪同我们到各地参观的负责同志和做接待工作的同志们所给予我们的隆重热烈的欢迎和亲切真诚的接待，我们代表中国人民在这里再一次表示衷心的感谢。
    我们出国访问期间，正是帝国主义者对社会主义阵营和反殖民主义民族独立运动发动了进攻竭力制造新的紧张局势的时候，同时也是帝国主义国家之间的矛盾更加尖锐化的时候。我们亲眼看到社会主义阵营各国的人民对帝国主义者在匈牙利进行颠复的罪恶活动和在埃及发动的武装进攻表示极大的愤慨，对匈牙利人民坚持社会主义制度的正义斗争、对埃及和阿拉伯各国人民坚决反抗侵略的正义斗争，表示极大的同情和支持。我们深深体会到这些兄弟国家的人民是坚决反对帝国主义侵略战争的，是热爱和平的。他们坚决主张所有不同社会制度的国家和平共处、和平竞赛，并且有维护世界和平的决心和力量，也有在和平竞赛中获得胜利的信心。他们从切身经验中，深知社会主义制度较之资本主义制度有无比的优越性，深知世界和平、民主、社会主义的力量，已经大过了帝国主义侵略集团的力量。现在不仅有以苏联为首的拥有九亿人口的社会主义阵营，而且有许多被压迫的民族已经从帝国主义的铁蹄下解放出来。全世界劳动人民，由于有了两次世界大战的经验教训，觉悟程度已经比过去大大地提高了。同时在帝国主义者那里，生产力和生产关系的矛盾日益尖锐，经济危机在增长。劳动人民的生活动荡不安、遭受着通货膨胀和失业的威胁，因而同垄断资本家的矛盾日益尖锐化，帝国主义国家相互间的矛盾也在日趋尖锐化。同时，殖民地和民族独立国家反对帝国主义压迫和侵略的斗争也在日益高涨。在这样的情况下，如果帝国主义者胆敢发动世界大战的话，结果不问可知，世界必然将出现更多的社会主义国家和民族独立国家，帝国主义者必然将在战争中毁灭他们自己。
    谁都知道，以美国侵略集团为首的帝国主义者对于社会主义各国的存在是死也不甘心的。他们仍然在实行扩张政策，不断制造紧张局势，扩军备战，进行侵略，威胁世界和平，并且明目张胆地宣布推翻社会主义国家，还恬不知耻地把他们这种罪恶活动，称之为“解放”。他们也知道发动世界大战，对他们是凶多吉少的。因此，他们还把希望寄托在社会主义阵营和社会主义各国内部的不和和分裂上，寄托在社会主义各国残余的反革命势力和他们的特务间谍的颠复活动上，这就是说，他们现在采用的是破坏社会主义各国的团结、各个击破和从社会主义国家内部“夺取堡垒”的办法。匈牙利事件和他们在社会主义国家间所进行的挑拨离间活动，就是这种罪恶活动的铁证。帝国主义者的这种罪恶活动，明白地告诉我们社会主义各国的人民，必须加强社会主义国家之间和各国内部的团结，必须提高警惕、肃清一切反革命分子。
    我们深深体会到，这些兄弟国家的人民群众是珍视社会主义各国之间的团结的，因为他们知道，这种团结和全世界无产者的团结是符合社会主义各国人民和世界一切进步人类的根本的利益的，也是符合全世界一切民族独立国家和其他爱好和平的国家和人民的利益的。团结就是力量，只要所有社会主义各国紧密地团结起来，只要社会主义各国同所有民族独立国家和一切爱好和平的国家和人民紧密地团结起来，世界的持久和平，社会主义国家和民族独立国家的安全和和平建设，就有了可靠的保障。
    是的，既然社会主义各国人民之间有着休戚相关的利害关系和加强相互团结的共同愿望，既然领导这些国家的共产党、工人党和劳动党都承认马克思列宁主义为共同的行动指针，既然这些国家都承认在处理相互关系中应该遵守无产阶级国际主义的原则，应该遵守互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处等原则，那么社会主义各国是应该而且能够坚固地团结起来的。在我们访问期间，许多社会主义国家的政府间和兄弟党间进行了一系列的会谈，加强了彼此间的友好团结，就是有力的证明。但是，这并不是说，我们兄弟国家和兄弟党之间永远不会在对某些问题的看法上有这样或者那样的分歧。不是的，如果在一个国家和一个党内还会有这样或者那样不同意见的话，在兄弟国家和兄弟党之间，对某些问题有这样或者那样的不同意见，是不足为奇的。可是在社会主义兄弟国家和兄弟党之间，相同的意见是根本的、主要的，不同的意见和相同的意见比较起来往往是比较小的和次要的。同时，只要以马克思列宁主义的根本原则为准绳，以全世界无产阶级的利益为基础，并且从团结的愿望出发，经过实事求是的科学的同志式的讨论和研究，不同意见是应该能够取得一致的。即便暂时有若干不同的意见，也应该珍重相互的团结。不利于团结的事情，总是不应该有的。这就是我们代表团在这次访问中认为应该特别强调的一个关键问题。
    我们全国人民代表大会的代表团第一次出国访问，已经获得了一个良好的开端。我们将以同样的兄弟热情在我国的土地上接待来自各个社会主义国家的议会代表团，同时也欢迎来自世界上一切国家的议会代表团前来我国访问。通过这次访问，证明作为一个国家的最高权力机关和各国人民意志的集中的代表者的各国议会，如果加强彼此间的直接联系，沟通各国人民间的感情和了解，并且把维护世界和平事业担当起来，那么各国议会是可以作出自己的重大贡献的。
