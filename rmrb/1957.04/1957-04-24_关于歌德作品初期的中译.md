Regarding the 125th anniversary of the passing of the great German poet Goethe, I feel it necessary to recount the early introduction of Goethe's life and works to Chinese readers by the Chinese literary circles, so that more people can understand the historical origins of cultural exchange between China and Germany in literature, and the deep friendship between the two peoples.

Those who have read the late Qing Dynasty magazine "Henan" and Mr. Lu Xun's work "Grave" all know that in 1907, Mr. Lu Xun praised the patriotism of German literature in his "On the Power of Mara Poetry," hoping to "show its inner quality to Chinese readers, hoping for some understanding," and repeatedly mentioned Qu Ti (Goethe). He spoke of his famous work "Fa Si Te" (Faust), of his "Wei Tuo" (Werther) four kinds of "worship as the ultimate masterpiece," and called Byron's epic "the ultimate writing of the world." He also hoped that someone in China could "make a voice of utmost sincerity, leading us to goodness, beauty, strength, and health," and "make a gentle voice, rescuing us from the desolation and cold." He hoped to use the power of literature to save China at that time.

This also illustrates the influence of German literature, and even Goethe, on Mr. Lu Xun and his readers.

In fact, this is not the first page. According to the materials already available, Goethe was introduced to China as early as 1903, or even as early as 1902. In July 1903, the "Biographies of Six Great German Literary Figures" (also titled "Biographies of Six Great German Pioneers"), translated and printed by Shanghai Zuoxin Society, included "Ke Te Zhuan" (Goethe's biography) as one of the articles. The translator was Zhao Bizhen (Yuesheng), based on the compilation of Japanese Oohashi Shintaro. He Zhenyi's translation of "History of Roman Literature" was published by Kaiming Bookstore in February of the same year. Zhao's translation can be said to be the second earliest Chinese translation of foreign literary history that has been seen.

In "Ke Te Zhuan", a detailed introduction was given to Goethe's life and works, his relationship with Xi Lu (Schiller), and his influence on German literature, with the text exceeding five thousand words. Here, we can take the introduction of "The Unhappiness of Ulu Te Lu" ("The Sorrows of Young Werther") as an example: "He then continued to write 'The Unhappiness of Ulu Te Lu'. The materials used in this legend all came from his own experiences. First, when he was in the Ulu Lu government, he occasionally attended dance parties, and showed great kindness to the daughter of the Nietz family (also a member of the court), and their friendship gradually became intimate, to the point where they could not bear to be separated for a day. Later, when he heard that this woman was betrothed to his friend Qi Si Tuo Wo Lu (secretary of the Liepzig embassy), he was disappointed and broke off the relationship, returning to his hometown. However, the feelings of love could not be extinguished, and he was saddened and wanted to commit suicide. At that time, there was also You Lu Sha Lie Me, who also committed suicide with a short gun because of a shadow incident. Mr. Ke Te was deeply moved by this matter, and felt sympathetic, so he wrote a legend, with Ulu Te Lu as the protagonist, half describing the affairs of You Lu Sha Lie Me, and half writing about his own feelings. The A Lu Wei Lu Tuo mentioned in the article is a variant of Qi Si Tuo Wo Lu, and the whole article is the incarnation of him and Ka Lu Luo Te Niang, which goes without saying. After this book was published, it was greatly loved and appreciated by the world, and critics competed to make earnest criticisms, and translators were enthusiastically engaged in translating it, and cowardly literary scholars scrambled to imitate it. At that time, the literary world actually brewed a kind of Ulu Te Lu epidemic. Moreover, many young and vigorous people were moved by this book and committed suicide. Mr. Ke Te's power is not also great!"

Finally, it also describes the writing process of "Lie Wu Si Tuo" (Faust) and the reflected Goethe's philosophical thoughts. It is said that Goethe's late works, "Lie Wu Si Tuo", are especially known to the world. "It took sixty years of sun and moon, and in fact put a lifetime of energy into it." "Using his own experience, mixed with philosophical ideals, and reaching a happy state, it is actually a kind of world-warning philosophy."

This is the earliest introduction of "The Sorrows of Young Werther" and "Faust" in China. In 1908, in the magazine "Xue Bao" (Vol. 1, No. 10), in the article "Review of Western Academic Thought in the Past 100 Years", the author Zhong Yao more generally praised: "Ge De (Goethe) is an objective poet. His personality has a comprehensive and all-encompassing overview. Therefore, his thoughts are also vast and boundless, like the limitlessness of the ocean. And his writing is inspired and surging, one wave for thousands of miles." And mentioned "Faust", "Hermann and Dorothea"...

The translation of Goethe's works began with the famous poet Ma He (Junwu). Between 1902 and 1903, he translated the complete poem "The Isles of Greece" by Byron. He also translated a section of poetry from Gui Tui's (Goethe) "The Sorrows of Young Werther", entitled "Amin's Poem of Crying for His Daughter by the Coast". The translation says: "Gui Tui is a great literary figure in Germany, unprecedented and unsurpassed, and those in our country who have read Western books know this. And the book 'Wei Te's Complaint' ('The Sorrows of Young Werther') is actually his earliest masterpiece to introduce himself to society. Sha Lou (Lotte) is already married, and Wei Te is seen with suspicion, and cannot often go to her house. One evening, seeing her husband Abe's death, he went there. Sha Lou loves Abe and pities Wei Te, and quietly says, 'Does Wei Te not think of Sha Lou being married?' So she ordered the servant to bring a letter to summon two or three girlfriends to come, in order to dispel Abe's suspicion, and to quickly send Wei Te away. The girlfriends could not all come, and Sha Lou was sad. After a while, her spirit suddenly strengthened, and she took the piano and played it herself, sitting next to Wei Te on an armchair, and said, 'Wei Te! Can you not sing a song for me?' Wei Te said sternly, 'No song!' Sha Lou said, 'In the box is the 'Poem of Osin' (Poem of Ossian), which you translated, and I have not yet read it. If it comes from your lips, it would be really good.' Wei Te smiled, took it and looked at it, his mind suddenly moved, and he sat and tears fell down, and sang it in the most sad voice. It is Amin's lament for the initial loss of his daughter. The lyrics are: Boundless startling waves hit the rocks, dark coast deep at night. A daughter's death is a long farewell, the old father is left with this body. The sea rocks hit each other endlessly, as if hearing my daughter's faint voice of complaint. The moonlight is not bright and the night is dark, and the shadow of the daughter is vaguely seen. Leaning against a dangerous rock, unable to sleep, the mad wind and rain are pressing people awake. Seeing the first sun rising in the east, the daughter's voice is no longer heard. Like the evening wind blowing wild grass, the traces are gone and nowhere to be found. The dead have sad eyes that are not closed, now only the old Amin remains. Amin fought hundreds of battles in his early years and his body is wasted, and now he is old, who will discuss marriage again. The sea waves rush and surge through thousands of mountains, and the angry waves fly and fall before me. At this time, Amin sits withered leaning against a dangerous rock, looking alone at the vast sea and sighing forever. Also seeing the slanting moon shining brightly, also seeing the daughter walking back and forth. The daughter's voice is whispering with whom, the old eyes are blurred and cannot recognize the truth. The daughter suddenly goes with the bright moon, not remembering the old father left in the world. The old father has no words but only sorrow, sorrow, sorrow, to whom to complain? Singing to this point, Sha Lou cried loudly. Wei Te threw the paper on the ground, took Sha Lou's hand, and washed it with his own tears. Sha Lou leaned on one arm and wiped her tears with a towel in one hand. The four eyes looked at each other and pitied each other. Sha Lou wanted to get up and leave, but was too sad to go. So she forced herself to stop crying and advised Wei Te to sing again. Wei Te was very tired, and forced himself to pick up the paper and continue singing, almost unable to make a sound. The wind seemed to wake me with love, the wind said the dewdrop returns you this is not your sleeping place. Alas! How long will my life be floating? Like a withered leaf attached to a high branch. Perhaps tomorrow a traveler will pass by here, seeing me lying long on the coast. Alas! The coast is desolate and the leaves are thick, Amin's dead bones will not be collected!"

This kind of translation method, which was popular at the time, is difficult to completely convey the spirit and style of the original work, and sometimes the discrepancies are very large. We only need to compare it with Guo Moruo's translation to easily understand the distance between them. However, we must understand the necessary difficulties in the process of exploring appropriate translation methods for the so-called "translators" of half a century ago, and the achievements should still be affirmed. Ma He also translated Goethe's "Mignon's Song":

"Do you know this land?
Where dark groves and orange trees stand,
A soft wind blows from azure skies,
The myrtle still, the laurel high,
Know you it well?
'Tis there! 'Tis there!
O, would that I with thee might fare!

Do you know that house?
Its hall and roof stand glorious.
It shines, the room with lustre bright,
And marble statues meet my sight:
Know you it well?
'Tis there! 'Tis there!
O, would that I with thee might fare!

Do you know that hill?
There clouds and mists the eye to fill.
The mule seeks his accustomed way,
Through vapours dim he loves to stray:
Know you it well?
'Tis there! 'Tis there!
O, would that I with thee might fare!"

These two poems have not yet been found to be published in the first draft. There is now a "Ma Junwu Poetry Collection" (1914) edition. The former was translated from English, and the latter from German. The "Preface to the Poetry Collection" states that it was completed in 1902-1903. If it was translated in the first year, it would be earlier than "Ke Te Zhuan", but it is currently difficult to confirm.

Following Ma He in translating Goethe's works was the famous poet Yanzi Mountain Monk Su Xuan Ying (Manshu). Xuan Ying worshipped Byron and loved Goethe. He mentioned him several times, such as in a letter to Gao Tianmei when he was in Java, saying: "Na believes that in order to study the literature of a country, one must be proficient in its writing. In the past, Qu De (Goethe) met people and would persuade them to study English, this sentence was specifically for Byron's poems. How can Qu De's talent not be able to translate Byron's poems, because it is not their true nature." The "Preface to Literary Destiny" also said: "Sakuntala drama... passed to Germany, and Goethe, upon seeing it, exclaimed that it was difficult to describe, so he praised it, which is the chapter 'Sakuntala'. Eastwick translated it into English, and Na re-translated it, with a sense of emotion." Translated poem:

"The spring flowers are gorgeous, and also spread their fragrance;
The autumn fruits are abundant, and also contain their treasures.
The distant sky, the vast earth,
That beautiful person, Sakuntala."

This poem was translated no later than 1910. These also show how Goethe's poems began to attract Chinese poets and readers. However, it was not until the May Fourth Movement, when China entered the period of the new democratic revolution, that the masses began to love, study and research, and were able to deeply understand the meaning of Goethe's works and recognize their true value.

At this time, the Creation Society and the Literary Research Association were established. Guo Moruo, the leader of the Creation Society and a famous poet, also published his complete translation of "The Sorrows of Young Werther" (1922, published by Tai Dong Bookstore). Fragments of his translation of "Faust" (Volume 1, first published by the Creation Society in 1928) were also published earlier in the "Xuedeng" supplement of the Shanghai "Shishi Xinbao". The appearance of the translation of "The Sorrows of Young Werther" immediately caused great fluctuations among young people. They were completely attracted by the two character images of Werther and Lotte, and the song "Lotte and Werther" became popular among them. Goethe's influence on China has been greatly developed because it meets the objective requirements of the time. Since then, many of Goethe's famous works, such as "Faust" (two volumes), "Hermann and Dorothea", "Stella", "Clavigo", "Egmont", "Mignon", "Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship", "Götz von Berlichingen", and "Goethe's Collection of Famous Poems", have been translated by Guo Moruo, Tang Yuanji, Hu Renyuan, Yu Wenbing, Wu Lifu, Zhou Xuepu, etc.; "Faust" and "Hermann and Dorothea" also have two translations. Research on Goethe, such as Zong Baihua's "Understanding Goethe", has also appeared in several volumes.

However, this is already beyond the scope of what this short article wants to describe. (Attached pictures)

    关于歌德作品初期的中译
    阿英
    为着纪念德国大诗人歌德逝世一百二十五周年，我感到有必要把中国文艺界初期介绍歌德生平和作品给中国读者的情况回叙一下，使更多的人了解中德两国文化交流在文学方面的历史渊源，和两国人民的深厚友好关系。
    读过清末杂志“河南”，和鲁迅先生著作“坟”的人，大都知道鲁迅先生在光绪三十三年（1907），就曾在“摩罗诗力说”篇里，赞扬过德国文学的爱国主义精神，向中国读者“示其内质，冀略有所悟解”，并一再说起瞿提（歌德）。说到他的名著“法斯忒”（浮士德），说到他对“韦陀”四种“崇为绝唱”，称裴伦（拜伦）史诗“为绝世之文”。还希望中国有人能“作至诚之声，致吾人于善美刚健”，“作温煦之声，援吾人出于荒寒”。期借文学之力，来拯救当时的中国。
    这也就说明了德国文学，以至歌德，对鲁迅先生及其读者的影响。
    事实上，这还不是最初的一页。据已经掌握的材料，歌德介绍到中国，最早是在光绪二十九年（1903），甚至再早到二十八年（1902）。二十九年七月，上海作新社译印的“德意志文豪六大家列传”（又题“德意志先觉六大家传”），“可特传”（歌德传）就是其间的一篇。译述者是赵必振（曰生），依据的材料，是日本大桥新太郎的编本。何震彝译述“罗马文学史”，是在同年2月，由开明书店出版，赵译可说是已见到的最早中译外国文学史的第二种。
    在“可特传”里，较详细的介绍了歌德生平及其著作，同希陆（席勒）的关系及其对德国文学的影响，文长逾五千言。这里可以引介绍“乌陆特陆之不幸”（“少年维特之烦恼”）的一节为例：氏又续著“乌陆特陆之不幸”。此一篇之传奇，其用材料，概自自己之阅历而来。先是氏之在乌拉陆府也，或时临踏舞会，与聂得氏之女（同为裁判处之人）恳意殷殷，既而交情日秘，渐有不可一日偶离之势。后闻此女许嫁于其友人契斯托渥陆（列扑耶公使之书记生），乃怅然而绝意，拂袖而归于乡里。而爱慕之情，终不能绝，悲愤不已，辄欲自杀。是时有同在裁判处由陆沙列么者，亦以影事，以短铳而自杀云。氏闻其事，大感悟，且感其同情，乃缀一传奇，以乌陆特陆为主人公，半述由陆沙列么之事，半写己情。其篇中所称阿陆卫陆托者，即契斯托渥陆之变体，其全篇即为氏与加陆洛特孃之化身，自不待论。此书既出，大博世人之爱赏，批评家争为恳切之批评，翻译家无不热心从事于翻译，而卑怯之文学者，争勉而模仿之。当时之文学界，竟酿成一种乌陆特陆之流行病。且青年血气之辈，因此书而动其感情以自杀者不少。可特氏之势力，不亦伟哉！
    最后还叙述了“列乌斯托”（浮士德）的写作过程，及反映的歌德哲学思想。说歌德晚年著述，“列乌斯托”尤为世人所知。“共费六十年之日月，实以一生之精力注之”。“以自家之经历，混和以哲学的之理想，而达于愉快之境，实为一种警世之哲学”。
    这是“少年维特之烦恼”和“浮士德”在中国最初的介绍。到了光绪三十四年（1908），杂志“学报”（第一卷第一○期）“百年来西洋学术之回顾”篇里，作者仲遥更概括的这样称道：“哥的
  （歌德）为客观的诗人。其为人有包罗万象之概。故其思想亦广大浩漫，如大洋之无垠。而其文章，则感兴奔流，一涛千里”。并提到“浮士德”、“赫曼与窦绿苔”……。
    歌德作品的翻译，始于名诗人马和（君武）。在光绪二十八至二十九年（1902—1903）间，他译述过拜伦“哀希腊”全诗。也译述过贵推（歌德）“少年维特之烦恼”里的一节诗文，题作“阿明临海岸哭女诗”。译文道：贵推为德国空前绝后一大文豪，吾国稍读西籍者皆知之。而“威特之怨”（少年维特之烦恼）一书，实其自绍介社会之最初杰著也。沙娄（绿蒂）既嫁，威特既见疑，不能常至其家。一夕，瞰其夫阿伯之亡也，往焉。沙娄既爱阿伯，复怜威特，悄然曰：“威特不思沙娄之既嫁乎？”乃令仆持函往召二三女友来，所以释阿伯之疑，且速威特之去也。女友皆不能至，沙娄黯然。少顷，气忽壮，取比牙琴自操之，傍威特坐于安椅，曰：“威特！不能为我歌一曲乎？”威特厉声曰：
  “无歌尔！”沙娄曰：“是箧内有‘欧心之诗’（莪相之诗），君所译也，予尚未读，若使其出于君之唇，则诚善矣。”威特笑，取而视之，意忽动，坐而泪涔涔下，以最哀之声歌之。是阿明哭其女初丧之词也。其词曰：莽莽惊涛激石鸣，溟溟海岸夜深临。女儿一死成长别，老父余生剩此身。海石相激无已时，似听吾儿幽怨声。月色不明夜气暝，朦胧如见女儿影。斜倚危石眠不得，风狂雨急逼醒人。眼见东方初日升，女儿声杳不可闻。有如晚风吹野草，一去踪迹无处寻。死者含哀目未瞑，只今独余老阿明。阿明早岁百战身既废，而今老矣谁复论婚姻。海波奔泻涌千山，怒涛飞起落吾前。此时阿明枯坐倚危石，独望沧溟一永叹。又见斜月灼耀明，又见女儿踯躅行。儿声唧唧共谁语，老眼模糊认不真。女儿忽随明月去，不忆人间遗老父。老父无言惟有愁，愁兮愁兮向谁诉？歌至此，沙娄大恸。威特掷纸于地，执沙娄之手，以己泪浣之。沙娄以一臂自倚，以一手执巾自揾其泪，四目相视，各相怜也。沙娄欲起离去，悲甚不能行。乃勉止泪，劝威特复歌。威特惫甚，强起拾纸续歌之，殆不能成声矣。风若有情呼我醒，风曰露珠复汝此非汝眠处。噫！吾命零丁复几时？有如枯叶寄高枝。或者明日旅人从此过，见我长卧海之湄。吁嗟乎！海岸寥空木叶稠，阿明死骨无人收！
    这样流行于当时的翻译方式，是很难完满的传达出原著的精神与风格，有时出入还很大。我们只要用郭沫若译本对照一下，就不难了解其间有怎样的距离。只是我们对半世纪前的所谓“译述者”，不能不谅解其在摸索恰当翻译方式过程中的必经的困难，成就还是应该肯定的。马和也译过歌德的“米丽客歌”（迷娘歌）：
    君识此，是何乡？园亭暗黑橙橘黄。碧天无翳风微凉，没药沉静丛桂香，君其识此乡。归欤归欤，愿与君归此乡。君识此，是何家？下撑楹柱上檐牙。石像识人如欲语，楼阁交错光影斜，君其识此家。归欤归欤，愿与君归此家。君识此，是何山？归马失途雾迷漫。空穴中有毒龙蟠，岩石奔摧水飞还，君其识此山。归欤归欤，愿与君归此山。这两篇诗，初稿还没有查出发表在哪里，现有“马君武诗稿”（1914）本，前者从英文，后者从德文译出。“诗稿自叙”说明成于1902—1903，如果译在头一年，那就更早于“可特传”，但目前还难以肯定。
    继马和译歌德作品的，有名诗人燕子山僧苏玄瑛（曼殊）。玄瑛崇拜拜伦，热爱歌德。他曾几次提起他，如在爪哇时寄给高天梅的信说：“衲谓凡治一国文学，须精通其文字。昔瞿德（歌德）逢人，必劝之治英文，此语专为拜伦之诗而发。夫以瞿德之才，岂未能译拜伦之诗，以非其本真耳”。“文学因缘自序”也说：“沙恭达罗剧曲……传至德，Goethe见之，惊叹难为譬说，遂为之颂，则‘沙恭达纶’一章是也。Eastwick译为英文，衲重迻译，感慨系之”。译诗云：
    春华瑰丽，亦扬其芬；
    秋实盈衍，亦蕴其珍。
    悠悠天隅，恢恢地轮，
    彼美一人，沙恭达纶。
    这首诗译成，至迟在宣统二年
  （1910）。这些，同样说明了歌德诗篇，是如何的开始吸引着中国诗人、读者。但引起广大热爱和学习研究，却在五四运动，中国进入新民主主义革命时期，能较深切的体会歌德作品意义，认识其真价以后。
    这时，创造社、文学研究会都成立了，创造社的领导者、名诗人郭沫若的“少年维特之烦恼”的全译本（1922，泰东书局刊）也出现了，他的“浮士德”（第一卷，1928年创造社始刊）译本的断片，也先此在上海“时事新报”副刊“学灯”上发表了。“少年维特之烦恼”的译本出现，立即在青年中引起很大的波动。他们完全被维特和绿蒂这两个人物形象吸引住了，在他们中流行着“绿蒂与维特”之歌。歌德对中国的影响，由于符合当时客观的要求，得到了很大的发展。从此，歌德的许多名著，如“浮士德”（二卷）、“赫曼与窦绿苔”、“史推拉”、“克拉维歌”、“哀格蒙特”、“迷娘”、“威廉的修业时代”、“铁手骑士葛兹”、“歌德名诗集”，就都由郭沫若、汤元吉、胡仁源、余文炳、伍蠡甫、周学普等先后翻译了过来；“浮士德”、“赫曼与窦绿苔”并有两种译本。关于歌德的研究，如宗白华等的“歌德之认识”，也出现了好几册。
    不过，这已经不在这篇短文所想叙述的范围之内了。（附图片）
