    Increase Timber Production
    *People's Daily* Commentator

    The issue of conserving timber has recently garnered relatively widespread attention. However, timber remains severely insufficient this year, with many pit props, papermaking materials, and general-purpose timber still not secured. Timber production departments must fully utilize forest resources and actively find ways to increase timber production to alleviate this supply-demand imbalance.

    Much timber that appears to be waste in forest areas is, in fact, in short supply in cities. What was previously considered waste material, such as so-called burnable timber, short timber, and wind-fallen timber, can largely be utilized today. Some can be used for general construction, some for pit props, some for papermaking, and even the smallest timber can be used to manufacture furniture and farm implements. According to a recent survey by the Yichun Forest Industry Bureau, each hectare of forest farm can produce approximately ten cubic meters more of off-grade and small-sized timber than the original design production target. Thus, in the state-owned forest areas' more than one hundred thousand hectares of forest farms alone, there is a potential to increase production by more than one million cubic meters of timber. If we add the clearing of past logging sites, the potential for increased production is considerable.

    Within timber harvesting and transportation enterprises, the potential for timber conservation is also substantial. The phenomenon of timber loss during production in many timber harvesting and transportation enterprises is quite severe. Along forest railway lines, on both sides of timber collection and transportation roads, and in loading yards and timber storage yards, discarded timber is a common sight. According to incomplete statistics from the Chuanxi, Wumin River, Youhao, and Tiansheng Forest Industry Bureaus, more than 540,000 cubic meters of so-called damaged timber have been discarded during production since 1950. Southern forest industry units, which primarily rely on water transport, could also save a considerable amount of timber if they strengthen the organization and leadership of rafting operations. According to statistics from the Sichuan Forest Industry Bureau, the annual loss rate during rafting is no less than 4%. If this could be reduced by 1%, more than 10,000 cubic meters of timber could be saved annually.

    In terms of timber used for self-consumption in forest areas, there is also a lot of timber that should be conserved but has not been. Taking only the item of timber used for heating by forest area workers as an example, the Yichun area alone consumes more than 350,000 cubic meters of "off-grade timber" annually, of which at least 100,000 cubic meters or more could be utilized. If all timber production units in the Northeast and Inner Mongolia regions could substitute branches and other fuels for some of the timber used for heating, it is estimated that 500,000 cubic meters of valuable timber could be saved.

    Last year, the average utilization coefficient of mechanical equipment in timber harvesting and transportation enterprises was only about 50%, with serious downtime and idleness. If we strive to improve equipment utilization this year, further leveraging the effectiveness of tractors, winches, trucks, and forest railways for timber collection and transportation, we can harvest and transport more timber. Units engaged in seasonal operations, if they actively find ways to increase the proportion of year-round operations and collect timber that was previously left in logging areas, log yards, and along transportation routes, can also contribute to the state's timber supply.

    Some leading cadres in timber harvesting and transportation enterprises worry that producing small-sized and off-grade timber will increase costs, reduce profits, and be difficult to sell. This concern is understandable. Due to the imbalance in timber production and sales in the past few years, timber prices were not reasonable, and timber-consuming units neglected to conserve timber, preferring only high-quality timber and rejecting lower-quality timber, leading to a large amount of timber being stockpiled and deteriorating, creating the mistaken impression for some timber production units that they should stop or reduce the production of off-grade and small-sized timber. However, the situation has now completely changed. Various timber-consuming departments have changed their demand and usage range for timber specifications, and many units have agreed to accept off-grade and small-sized timber, providing favorable conditions for expanding timber sales. The idea of being afraid of increasing unit costs is also not in line with the facts. The Yichun Forest Industry Bureau conducted a special survey and research, and the results showed that producing small-sized and off-grade timber can save 39 yuan per hectare of forest farm in wages for clearing forest farms, and can save more than 2 yuan in fixed costs. Compared with past costs, it is only 0.35 yuan higher. If labor organization is further improved and labor productivity is increased, costs will be reduced. At the same time, the selling price of off-grade and small-sized timber has now increased, and some timber-consuming units have proposed not only guaranteeing commodity costs but also agreeing to provide a certain profit. Therefore, the concern that it will affect profit remittance is also unnecessary.

    Currently, many grassroots workers also have some ideological obstacles to producing small-sized and off-grade timber. They say, "What's the use of these small, inferior pieces of wood?" "There is plenty of large, high-quality timber, why bother with these!" In particular, the fear of trouble is relatively common. Therefore, the Party and government leading cadres of timber harvesting and transportation enterprises need to conduct in-depth ideological education and organizational leadership work, raise workers' awareness of the shortage of forest resources and the difficulty of obtaining timber, change the old production habits of the past, and mobilize them to work hard for increased timber production for a long time.

    增产木材
    本报评论员
    节约木材的问题，近来已引起比较广泛的重视。但是，今年木材仍然严重不足，有不少的坑木、造纸材和一般用材还没有着落。木材生产部门必须充分利用森林资源，努力设法增产木材，才能缓和这种供不应求的局势。
    有许多木材在林区看来是废物，在城市看来却是缺货。过去被看成废材的所谓烧掉材、短材和风倒木等等，今天看来，绝大部分是可以利用的。有的可以用于一般建筑，有的可以用作坑木，有的可以造纸，最小规格的木材还可用以制造家具和农具。根据最近伊春森林工业管理局的调查，每公顷林场可较原设计产量指标多生产十立方公尺左右的等外材和小规格材。这样，仅在国有林区十万多公顷的林场内就存在着增产一百多万立方公尺木材的潜力。如果再加上清理过去的采伐迹地，增产的潜力是相当可观的。
    在木材采伐运输企业里，节约木材的潜力也是相当大的。不少木材采伐运输企业在生产中丢失木材的现象相当严重。在森林铁路沿线，在集材运材道路两旁以及装车场、贮木场，被丢掉的木材触目皆是。根据川西、乌敏河、友好、田升等四个森林工业局的不完全统计，从1950年以来，在生产过程中丢弃的所谓坏材就有五十四万多立方公尺。南方以水运为主的森林工业单位，如能加强流送的组织领导，也可以节约相当数量的木材。据四川森林工业管理局统计，历年流送损失率不下4％，如争取降低1％，一年就可以少损失一万多立方公尺木材。
    在林区自用木材方面，也有很多木材应当节约而没有节约下来。仅就林区职工取暖烧木拌这一项来说，伊春一个地区一年就消耗三十五万多立方公尺“等外材”，其中可以利用的至少有十万立方公尺以上。如果东北和内蒙古地区各个木材生产单位都能用枝桠和其他燃料代用一部分木拌，估计将可节约五十万立方公尺有利用价值的木材。
    去年，木材采伐运输企业的机械设备平均利用系数只达50％左右，停工和窝工现象很严重。如果今年努力提高设备利用率，使拖拉机、绞盘机、汽车和森林铁路等集材运材工具进一步发挥效能，就可以多采伐和多运出许多木材来。季节作业的单位，如果积极设法提高常年作业的比重，把过去丢在伐区、楞场以及运材道两旁的木材收集起来，也可以使国家多得到许多木材。
    有些木材采伐运输企业的领导干部，怕生产小规格材和等外材会提高成本，减少利润，销售不出去。这种顾虑是可以理解的。由于过去几年木材产销不平衡，木材价格不够合理，需材单位忽视节约木材，只要好材不要次材，以致一度产生大量木材积压变质的现象，给某些木材生产单位造成了应当停止生产或少生产等外材及小规格材的错觉。但是，现在情况完全改变了，各需材部门对木材规格的需求和使用范围有了变化，许多单位已同意要等外材和小规格材，这就给扩大木材的销路提供了有利条件。怕提高单位成本的想法也是不符合事实的。伊春森林工业管理局曾专门作了调查研究，调查结果证明，生产小规格材和等外材，每公顷林场可比过去节约三十九元清理林场的工资，可节省固定性费用二元多，同过去成本相较，只高三角五分。如果进一步改善劳动组织，提高劳动生产率，成本还会降低。同时，现在等外材和小规格材的售价已有所提高，有的需材单位已提出不仅保证商品成本，还同意给予一定利润。因此，怕影响上缴利润的顾虑也是不必要的。
    目前有不少基层职工对生产小规格材和等外材，也有一些思想障碍。他们说：“这些小木头次木头有什么用？”“大木头好木头有的是，还在乎这些！”特别是怕麻烦的思想比较普遍。因此木材采伐运输企业的党政领导干部，需要深入地进行思想教育和组织领导工作，提高职工对祖国森林资源不足和木材来之不易的认识，转变过去旧的生产习惯，动员他们持久地为增产木材而努力。（附图片）
