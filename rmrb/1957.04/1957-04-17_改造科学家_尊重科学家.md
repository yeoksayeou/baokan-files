    Remolding Scientists
    Respecting Scientists
    Director of the Technical Sciences Department of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yan Jici

    Under the present circumstances, the Party should let go and trust scientists to manage their own work well.

    The Party can lead science, and indeed, the Party must lead science. In socialist construction, science is not an optional extra; on the contrary, science is a crucial factor that plays a decisive role. The Chinese people, now standing tall, understand this. The Chinese Communist Party, leading the Chinese people in building a socialist motherland, must not relinquish its responsibility for leading science in the slightest. All of China's scientific workers wholeheartedly support and earnestly request the Party to strengthen its leadership over science. The Chinese Communist Party, armed with Marxism-Leninism, has led the Chinese people's revolution from one victory to another, and it will surely be able to lead China's science to flourish and prosper, catching up with advanced international levels in a not-too-long period of time. The achievements made in science over the past seven years since liberation fully illustrate this point.

    How should the Party lead science at present? I think that on the one hand, it should remold scientists, and on the other hand, it should respect scientists.

    Most of our country's scientists have received bourgeois education in Europe and America and therefore need to be remolded; at the same time, they have also suffered from the oppression and exploitation of imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism, and generally speaking, they are patriotic. The Party's policy of uniting, educating, and remolding them is entirely correct and has already achieved considerable success. Most scientists support socialism and have an urgent desire for self-remolding. Therefore, the Party must help them to intensify their ideological remolding so that they can connect theory with practice in their creative labor, so that their work can serve socialist construction and serve the people, and so that they can recognize the truth of dialectical materialism and establish a proletarian worldview through their own practice.

    While scientists are in the process of self-remolding, the country's construction requires them to contribute their strength; we cannot wait until they are completely remolded before they start working. Therefore, in addition to helping them with self-remolding, the Party also needs to especially respect them, respect their skills and their occasional foolishness. Dissipate their concerns, listen to their opinions, understand their intentions, and solve their difficulties in their work, so as to fully unleash their enthusiasm and creativity. A scientist who has worked in the laboratory for a long time can easily have some "eccentricities." And because the division of scientific labor is becoming increasingly detailed and research is becoming increasingly in-depth, one-sidedness often becomes a common ailment associated with experts. These shortcomings can be avoided in future intellectuals and are what today's intellectuals must overcome in their self-remolding. But for some older scientists, it is worthwhile to utilize even these shortcomings, focusing on the aspects that can be considered "strengths." For example, encourage them to use their expertise to solve current specialized problems; pass on all their outstanding skills to the next generation. This requires very patient and meticulous understanding of them, sympathizing with them, making them happy to approach the Party, and feel the warmth of the Party. "A scholar is used by one who knows him well, a woman adorns herself for one who pleases her," although these are old sayings containing a very strong feudal consciousness, but today, the one who can "know" and "please" the scientist is the Communist Party. The Party's leadership over science must achieve "knowing" the scientists and "pleasing" the scientists.

    The Party's leadership over science includes ideological leadership and organizational leadership, and also includes professional leadership. The doubts of individual scientists about whether the Party can lead science, I think, also refer to professional leadership. The Party's implementation of the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom in its leadership of science demonstrates the Party's prudent attitude toward scientific work. Under the present circumstances, the Party should let go and trust scientists to manage their own work well. The Party is earnestly cultivating young scientists, consciously training some cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds to become scientists, and absorbing some progressive scientists into the Party. The Party will be fully capable of leading science professionally in the next few years. The Soviet Union's experience fully confirms this.

    改造科学家
    尊重科学家
    中国科学院技术科学部主任　严济慈
    在目前情况下，党要放手，要信任科学家来搞好自己的业务。
    党能领导科学，而且党不能不领导科学。在社会主义建设中，科学不是可有可无的东西，相反地，科学是一个起着决定性作用的重要因素。站起来了的中国人民懂得这一点。领导中国人民建设社会主义祖国的中国共产党，决不能丝毫放弃对科学领导的责任。全中国的科学工作者也莫不衷心拥护与恳切要求党对科学加强领导。以马克思列宁主义武装起来的中国共产党，领导中国人民革命从一个胜利走向一个胜利，也必然能胜任愉快地领导着中国科学向前蓬勃发展，繁荣昌盛，在不太长的时间内，赶上国际先进的水平。解放后七年来在科学事业上所取得的成绩，就可以充分说明这一点。
    党在目前应如何领导科学呢？我想，一方面要改造科学家，另一方面还要尊重科学家。
    我国的科学家中，大多数受过欧美资本主义的资产阶级教育，因而是需要改造的；同时他们也身受过帝国主义与官僚资本主义的压迫与剥削，一般说来又都是爱国的。党对他们所采取的团结、教育、改造的政策是完全正确的，而且已经取得了相当大的成效。大多数科学家都拥护社会主义，并有自我改造的迫切要求。因此，党必须帮助他们加紧改造思想，使他们在自己的创造性劳动中能够理论联系实际，使他们的劳动成果能为社会主义建设服务、为人民服务，使他们通过自己的实践认识到辩证唯物主义的真理，建立起无产阶级的世界观。
    当科学家在自我改造过程中间，国家建设要求他们贡献出力量，不能等他们改造好后才从事工作。因此，除了帮助他们自我改造，党还需要特别尊重他们，尊重他们有一技之长与一得之愚。解除他们的顾虑，倾听他们的意见，了解他们的意图，解决他们工作中的困难，这样来充分发挥他们的积极性与创造性。一个在实验室里工作久了的科学家很容易有些“怪脾气”。又由于科学分工愈来愈细，研究愈钻愈深，片面性往往成为与专家联在一起的一种通病。这些缺点在今后的劳动知识分子中是可以免除的，也是今日知识分子在自我改造中所要克服的。但对某些老科学家，还不妨从这些缺点中就其可以作为“长处”的一面来加以利用。譬如鼓励他们发挥他们的专长来解决当前的专门问题；把他们出色的本领全部传授给下一代。这就需要十分耐心细致地了解他们，同情他们，使他们乐于靠拢党，而感觉党的温暖。“士为知己者用，女为悦己者容”，虽然是两句包含十分浓厚的封建意识的旧话，但在今日能“知”科学家的与能“悦”科学家的就是共产党。党对科学的领导就要做到“知”科学家与“悦”科学家。
    党对科学的领导，包括思想领导和组织领导，也还包括业务领导。个别科学家对党能否领导科学的怀疑，我想也指业务领导而言。党对科学领导实现百家争鸣的方针，说明了党对科学工作的审慎态度。在目前情况下，党要放手，要信任科学家来搞好自己的业务。党正在认真地培养青年科学家，有意识地培养若干工农出身的干部成为科学家，并吸收若干进步的科学家入党。党在今后几年之内，完全有可能在业务上领导科学。苏联的经验完全证实了这一点。
