    "Television Spies" Visit Middle School
    American television cameras have no limits to the bizarre subjects they capture, often focusing on murder, robbery, and pornography. But this is not enough; television has an even greater use in America, acting as "television spies."
    In the Pearl River area of New York, middle school students are being monitored by "television spies." Television cameras are installed in the corners of student study rooms, and the television sets are placed on the principal's office desk. This way, the principal and his staff can watch students' activities during study time on the television screen at any time.
    According to reports in the "New York Times" and "Newsweek," this "television spy" has been around for three years. Initially, it was used in prisons, then expanded to department stores to replace plainclothes police in monitoring pickpockets. Now, it has begun to visit middle schools to deal with young students.
    The American magazine "The Nation" expressed great indignation about this matter. It wrote: "This kind of surveillance is completely wrong. Free people resent being spied on behind their backs. We say this is espionage and a blatant violation of private activity. … Before long, from dawn to dusk, from birth to death, we will be monitored by television cameras. This is not only wrong and sneaky, but also resembles something un-American, and this activity should be stopped immediately. Let the teachers do their jobs again, and let this anti-pickpocket police return to the department stores."
    In reality, how much freedom the American people have now is very questionable. However, it is true that middle school students are being monitored like prisoners and pickpockets, which is something that only happens in countries where McCarthyism prevails.　　　　(Ge) (Attached picture)

### “电视间谍”光临中学

    “电视间谍”光临中学
    美国电视镜头的对象无奇不有，它经常以猎取凶杀、抢劫、色情场面为能事。这还不够，电视机在美国还有更大的用场，充当起“电视间谍”来了。
    在纽约的珍珠河地区，中学生正在受到“电视间谍”的监视。学生的作习室的墙角上安装着电视摄影镜头，电视机则摆在校长办公室的桌子上。这样，校长及其左右就可以从电视幕上随时窥视学生在作习时间里的活动。
    据“纽约时报”和“新闻”周刊报道：这种“电视间谍”已经有了三年的历史，最初它被用于监狱，然后推广到百货商店用以替代便衣警察监视扒手。现在它开始光临到中学来对付青年学生了。
    美国“民族”周刊对这件事表示极大愤慨。它写道：“这种监视是完全错误的。自由的人们无不愤恨背地受人监视。我们说这是一种间谍活动，并认为是公然侵犯私人活动。……不用多久，我们将从黎明到夜阑人静、从脱胎到寿终正寝，都要受电视摄影镜头的监视了。这不仅是错误的、鬼鬼祟祟的，而且是酷似非美的，应该立即停止这种活动。重新让教师们各尽其职，让这种防扒手的警察回到百货商店去吧。”
    实际上，现在美国人民还有多少自由，是很成问题的。不过，的确，中学生也被当作囚犯和扒手一样来加以监视，这是只有在麦卡锡主义盛行的国度里才会有的事。　　　　（葛）（附图片）
