    Can Essays Be Denied?
    Peng Botong
    While essays in the past were indeed mainly aimed at enemies, this does not prove that they cannot be used against ourselves internally.
    If we compare essays to sharp daggers, capable of killing enemies, why can't we also compare them to sharp scalpels, for surgeons to remove pus and rotten flesh from people's bodies? In fact, essays in recent years have mainly played the latter role; although both are sharp, treating one's own people as enemies is extremely rare. Essays contain satire, and satire is a true exposure and profound criticism. All kinds of erroneous thoughts and work styles, that is, ideological behaviors in various forms that are incompatible with socialism, exist objectively. Exposing them and giving them sharp and profound criticism will only cause people to deeply reflect and awaken, and then overcome them. This not only does not violate the principle of dealing with contradictions among the people, but can also promote the achievement of unity through essays, which is beneficial and harmless to the socialist cause. Naturally, the satire of comrades should be appropriate and measured, and comrades should not be satirized as enemies.
    Some people don't like essays; they try every means to deny and oppose them. They have many arguments, too numerous to mention, mainly relying on three: One argument is that essays are尖酸刻薄 (jiānsuānkèbó - sharp and mean), not an attitude of being kind to others. According to this argument, only getting along harmoniously is called "being kind to others." Another argument is that the people who write essays may not be without ideological problems themselves. According to this argument, only someone born completely without flaws is qualified to write this kind of article. Still another argument is that essays are not comprehensive, only highlighting one aspect, and are therefore one-sided. In fact, whether something is comprehensive depends on whether the basic argument, the analysis made, and the opinions put forward are comprehensive. Talking about only one aspect may not be one-sided, and listing everything may not be comprehensive. These arguments, in a nutshell, are afraid of being criticized by others, finding various excuses to reject criticism, that's all.
    However, essays cannot be denied after all. The situation mentioned above has also greatly changed; people's ideological awareness is constantly improving, and the atmosphere of humbly accepting criticism is constantly expanding. The more ideological awareness improves, the more capable one is of withstanding criticism and satire. People who can withstand satire and are good at accepting satirical criticism are also the easiest to make continuous progress.
    How to improve essays a step further is a problem that needs to be solved currently. Essays, not only as Comrade Huichun said, need to have life, thought, science, art, and style, but also need a lot, the more the better. To achieve this, strengthening life experience and ideological training, enriching various knowledge, and improving writing skills are naturally necessary. Achieving these things requires a process and cannot be accomplished overnight. If we hang up a standard that cannot be reached currently, or cannot all be reached, and set down some strict rules and regulations, and blame as soon as something doesn't fit, it will hinder improvement. As long as there is something commendable, even if there are shortcomings or even many, it should be encouraged. Naturally, shortcomings must also be pointed out, and pointing out shortcomings is not equal to blaming. Everyone writing, learning from each other through observation, and mutually influencing and improving will continuously improve the quality of essays and bring forth people who are good at writing essays.

    杂文是否定不了的
    彭伯通
    过去的杂文诚然主要是针对敌人的，但是并不能因此证明不能用来针对自己内部。
    倘若把杂文比做锋利的匕首，可致敌人于死命，又何尝不可比做锋利的解剖刀，供外科医生剜去人们身上的脓疮腐肉？事实上，几年来的杂文主要起着后一种作用；尽管同为锋利，把自己人当做敌人的事情究竟极少。杂文中有讽刺，讽刺正是一种真实的揭露和深刻的批评。各色各样的错误思想作风，亦即表现为各种形态的、同社会主义不相容的思想行为，是客观存在的，把它们揭露出来，给予尖锐的、深刻的批评，无非引起人们深思猛省，加以克服。这同对待人民内部矛盾的原则不仅并无违背之处，而且可以通过杂文来促进达到团结的目的，对于社会主义事业有利无害。自然，对同志的讽刺要恰当，要有分寸，不能把同志当做敌人来讽刺。
    有人对杂文看不顺眼，他们千方百计地否定杂文，反对杂文。他们说法甚多，不胜枚举，主要靠三种：一种说法是，杂文尖酸刻薄，不是与人为善的态度。按照这样的说法，只有一团和气才叫“与人为善”了。一种说法是，写杂文的人未必没有思想毛病。按照这样的说法，只有天生一种完全没有缺点的人才配写这种文章。还有一种说法是，杂文不全面，只突出一面，因而是片面的。其实，是否全面，要看基本论点、所作的分析和提出的意见是否具有全面性，只谈一面未必片面，面面罗列未必全面。这些说法，一言以蔽之，怕别人批评，找出种种借口来拒绝批评，如此而已。
    可是，杂文毕竟是否定不了的。上面所说的这种情况也已经大有改变；人们的思想觉悟在不断提高，虚心接受批评的风气在不断扩大。思想觉悟越提高，也就越经得起批评和讽刺。经得起讽刺的人，善于接受讽刺的批评的人，又是最容易不断获得进步的。
    如何把杂文提高一步，是当前需要解决的问题。杂文，不但如回春同志所说，需要有生活，有思想，有科学，有艺术，有风格，而且需要很多，越多越好。要做到这样，加强生活的体验和思想锻炼，丰富各种知识，提高写作水平，自然是必要的。要做到这些，需要一个过程，不能一蹴而就。如果悬着一个目前还不能达到、或不能都达到的标准，订下若干清规戒律，一有不合就加责难，就会阻碍提高。只要有一点可取之处，尽管有缺点甚至不少，都该鼓励。自然，缺点也要指出，指出缺点并不等于责难。大家都写，彼此观摩学习，相互影响提高，是会不断提高杂文质量、涌现出善于写杂文的人来的。
