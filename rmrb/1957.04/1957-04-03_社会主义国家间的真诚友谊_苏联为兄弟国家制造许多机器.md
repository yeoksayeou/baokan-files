Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 2nd. Soviet workers continue to manufacture many machines and equipment for the fraternal socialist countries, and trains carrying these products are continuously departing from the Soviet Union.

    Workers in Moscow, Leningrad, Sverdlovsk, Voroshilovgrad, Irkutsk and other places are manufacturing machinery and equipment for China. Metallurgical workers in Leningrad shipped about one hundred train carloads of machinery and various equipment to China in January. The "Communist" mining equipment factory in Krivoy Rog shipped four of the eight ore loading machines ordered this year to China's Anshan Iron and Steel Company in early February. Ryazan city also recently shipped some newly manufactured giant lathes to China. Among the machines shipped from Moscow to China, there is a new type of high-speed lathe “л一二二○M”, which can process parts with a diameter of up to 700 mm and a cutting speed of more than 3,000 meters per minute.

    Other fraternal countries are also constantly receiving machines and equipment manufactured by the Soviet Union. The "Communist" mining equipment factory in Krivoy Rog plans to manufacture more than 1,600 machines and more than 3,600 sets of equipment for Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary and other countries this year. The textile machinery manufacturing factory in Ivanovo, a famous textile industrial city in the Soviet Union, manufactured 30 models of dyeing and finishing machines and a new type of four-column continuous scouring machine for fine silk fabrics for a textile joint venture being built in Pyongyang. Compared with the existing machines, this scouring machine occupies half the area and can increase the labor productivity of workers by 73%. In Dneprodzerzhinsk, the Dzerzhinsky Metallurgical Plant manufactured 140 tons of thin steel plates for Hungary on March 20, a week ahead of schedule. Prior to this, in the first few months of this year, the factory had manufactured and shipped two trainloads of cast iron and various rolled steel products to Hungary to help it quickly restore industrial production.

    The Kirov Machine Manufacturing Plant in Stalinino Oblast is producing the "Miner-II" coal mining combine for our country. The picture shows fitter Kovtunenko carrying out installation work.

    社会主义国家间的真诚友谊
    苏联为兄弟国家制造许多机器
    新华社莫斯科2日电　苏联工人继续为各兄弟社会主义国家制造许多机器和装备，载着这些产品的列车源源不断地从苏联开出。
    莫斯科、列宁格勒、斯维德洛夫斯克、伏罗希洛夫格勒、伊尔库次克等地的工人都在为中国制造机器装备。列宁格勒的冶金工人一月间就向中国运走了约一百火车车皮的机器和各种装备。克里沃罗格的“共产党人”采矿设备工厂在2月初为中国的鞍山钢铁公司运去了今年订货的八台矿石装车机中的四台。梁赞城最近也向中国运走了一些新制造的巨型车床。在莫斯科运往中国的机器中，有一台“л一二二○M”型新式高速车床，能够加工直径达七百毫米的部件，切削速度每分钟可以达到三千多公尺。
    其他兄弟国家也在不断收到苏联制造的机器和设备。克里沃罗格的“共产党人”采矿设备工厂今年准备为捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利等国制造一千六百多台机器和三千六百多套设备。苏联著名的纺织工业城伊凡诺沃的纺织机器制造工厂，为正在平壤兴建的一座纺织联合企业制造了三十种型号的染整机和一台精制丝织品用的新型四柱式连续操作著练机。和现有的机器比较，这台著练机的占地面积少一半，而能使工人的劳动生产率提高73％。在第聂伯罗捷尔任斯基，捷尔任斯基冶金工厂3月20日提前一周为匈牙利制造成一百四十吨薄钢板。在这以前，这个工厂在今年头几个月内已经为匈牙利制成和运出了两列车铸铁和各种轧钢，以帮助它迅速恢复工业生产。
