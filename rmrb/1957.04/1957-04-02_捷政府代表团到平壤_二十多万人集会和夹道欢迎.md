Široký said that the unity and continuous development of the socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, is the fundamental guarantee of the freedom, independence, security, and prosperity of all socialist countries. This is also a guarantee for the Korean people to achieve victory in their struggle for the reunification of their motherland.

Široký said that Korea and Czechoslovakia have already created conditions for developing cooperation in economic, scientific and technological, and cultural fields. The friendly relations between the two countries greatly benefit the happiness of the two peoples and the development of the cause of peace and socialism.
