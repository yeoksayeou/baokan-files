    Guarantee Extracurricular Study and Enrich Children's Lives
    Most Elementary School Students in Tianjin Form Family Study Groups
    (Our newspaper dispatch) Under the guidance and assistance of the Municipal and District Extracurricular Education Steering Committees, the majority of Tianjin's 370,000 elementary school students have formed family study groups outside of school.
    These groups are voluntarily formed by the children under the guidance of teachers. The main task of the groups is to ensure that the children study well outside of school. Many schools have hired some parents as family counselors, responsible for guiding the children's extracurricular life. Most parents actively support the group activities. Many families have cramped housing, but they still find ways to make room for the children to study well. When children come to their homes to study, many parents enthusiastically boil water, set up desks and chairs for the children. Some parents also help the children review their lessons, arrange their lives, and solve various problems. In order to study well, many students in the groups consciously formulated "Group Pledges," stipulating systems such as not being late, not leaving early, and completing homework on time.
    Students participating in the groups, under the care and help of their parents during the half-day when there are no classes, are generally able to concentrate on doing homework and reviewing lessons. A student surnamed Qian in the Nankai District Central Elementary School used to be very playful and did not like to study. He often got "two points" on exams. After joining the group, under everyone's supervision, he was able to hand in his homework on time, and his grades have improved to "four points" or "five points."
    Some groups of children not only do homework together, but also spend about half an hour carrying out some recreational and sports activities to enrich the group's life. Some schools have also established "interest groups" according to the children's hobbies and specialties. These interest groups consist of students who live relatively close to each other and have similar interests, and there are many different kinds of activities. Some sixth-grade girls in Zhongying Elementary School in Chengxiang District who like embroidery are practicing embroidery and sewing clothes under the guidance of family counselors; some third-grade children who like puppets have already made puppets.
    Schools generally attach great importance to the leadership of student study groups, with dedicated personnel responsible for them. Many teachers go to the groups in a planned way to help students carry out activities, and pay attention to timely praise of good groups, enrich the content of activities, and consolidate the groups. At the same time, since the beginning of this semester, many schools have paid attention to strengthening parental work, giving play to the parents' enthusiasm, and doing a good job in family study groups.

    保证课外学习　丰富儿童生活
    天津市大部小学生组成家庭学习小组
    本报讯　在市、区校外教育指导委员会的指导和帮助下，天津市三十七万名小学生，大部分已在课外组成了家庭学习小组。
    这些小组都是在教师的指导下，由孩子们自愿组成的。小组的主要任务是保证孩子们课外学习得好。许多学校已经聘请了一些学生家长担任家庭辅导员，负责辅导孩子们的课外生活。家长们对小组活动大多是积极支持的。不少家庭住房较挤，可是为了让孩子们学习好，也想办法腾出地方来。许多家长在孩子们来自己家里学习的时候，热心地为孩子烧开水、摆桌椅，有些家长还帮助孩子们温习功课、安排生活、解决各种问题。许多小组的学生为了学习好，自觉地订立了“小组公约”，规定了不迟到、不早退、按时完成作业等制度。
    参加小组的学生，在不上课的半天里，在家长的照顾和帮助下，一般都能安心做作业、复习功课。南开区中心小学一个姓钱的小学生过去很贪玩，不爱念书，考试常得“二分”，参加小组以后，在大家的督促下，已能按时交作业，功课已经考到“四分”或“五分”了。
    有些小组的孩子，不只在一起作功课，还用半个小时左右的时间开展一些文娱体育活动，丰富小组的生活。有些学校还根据孩子们的爱好和特长，建立了“兴趣小组”。在这些兴趣小组里，都是住得比较近的同学，而且兴趣相近，活动花样很多。城厢区中营小学六年级一些喜欢刺绣的女孩子，在家庭辅导员的辅导下，练习绣花和缝制衣物；三年级一些喜欢木偶的孩子已经做出了木偶人。
    各校对于学生学习小组的领导一般都很重视，有专人负责。许多教师有计划地到各小组去帮助学生开展活动，并注意及时表扬好的小组，丰富活动内容，使小组巩固下来。同时，本学期以来，许多学校已注意加强家长工作，发挥了家长们的积极性，搞好家庭学习小组。（附图片）
