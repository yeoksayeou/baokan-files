    The British Museum Compiles a New "General Catalogue of Printed Books"

    According to a notice issued by the British Museum at the beginning of the year, the museum is preparing to publish a new "General Catalogue of Printed Books" (English original name: General Catalogue of Printed Books; A New Edition Complete to the End of 1955). All printed books acquired before the end of 1955, except those printed in Oriental languages, will be included in the general catalog. The museum is now soliciting pre-orders, and if the number of pre-orders reaches a certain amount, they plan to start publishing in 1958.

    The British Museum began compiling a new edition of the general catalog of books in 1930 (the old edition was compiled in the nineteenth century; recently, an American microfilm edition has been published). However, the compilation and typesetting procedures were cumbersome. After more than twenty years, only fifty-one volumes were published by 1954 (up to Dezwarte, Amie). Alphabetically speaking, this was less than one-sixth of the entire book. The catalog was published so slowly that it could no longer reflect the collection, and completion seemed so distant that it had to be temporarily suspended. Now, the museum has decided to use photographic printing to print the general catalog of books. The British Museum's main reading room originally had a book-style general catalog, with each page divided into left and right columns. One column contained clippings from the old edition of the general catalog, and the other contained typeset slips of newly added books. This compiled catalog reached a total of one thousand two hundred and fifty volumes (the British Museum does not use card catalogs). According to the new plan, one such catalog will be dismantled, and the entries will be rearranged in alphabetical order, pasted into books, and then photographed and printed. It is estimated that the new photoprinted catalog will be three hundred volumes in total, with one volume published each week, and the entire catalog can be completed within six years. The price of the catalog is estimated at eight pounds per volume, with the entire book costing approximately two thousand four hundred pounds, with an annual prepayment of approximately four hundred pounds.

    The publication of the British Museum's General Catalogue of Printed Books is a major event in the academic world. The museum has a particularly rich collection of old books. It is said that only 5% of the books printed before 1800 in the museum's collection can be found in the Library of Congress in the United States (which has already published a catalog of printed books). Compiling a general catalog of books is not an easy task. The German general catalog only published a few volumes before being suspended before the Second World War. The French National Library's general catalog of books has been published for half a century and is still not complete. If the British Museum can print the general catalog of books in six or seven years, this will be a great contribution to the academic world.

### 大英博物院编印新的“印本图书总目”

    大英博物院编印新的“印本图书总目”
    据大英博物院年初发出的通告消息，该院准备出版一部新的“印本图书总目”（英文原名General　Catalogue　of　Printed　Books；A　NewEdition　Complete　to　the 　End　of1955），所有1955年底以前入藏的印本图书，除了用东方文字印的以外，将全部收入总书目内。该院现在正在征求预约，如果预约的户数能达到一定的数目，准备在1958年开始出书。
    大英博物院从1930年起，原在编印新版图书总目（旧版是在十九世纪编的，近有美国缩印本印行），但编、排手续繁重，过了二十多年，到1954年才出了五十一册（到Dezwarte，Amie），按字母来说，尚不到全书六分之一；目录出版得这样慢，早已不能反映藏书情况，同时完成遥遥无期，不得不暂行停刊。现在该院决定采用影印办法来印图书总目。大英博物院大阅览室原来备有书本式总目，目录每页分左右两行，一行贴剪裁开来的旧版图书总目，一行贴新增图书的铅印条子，这样拼凑起来的目录，全部达到一千二百五十册（大英博物院不用卡片目录）。照新拟的办法，准备把一部这样的目录拆散，把各条重新按一个字顺排列起来，贴在本子上照相影印。据估计，新影印目录全部将是三百册，每星期可以出一册，全部目录可于六年内出齐。目录的价格估计为每册八英镑，全书约需二千四百英镑，每年预付一次，约四百镑。
    大英博物院的印本图书总目的出版是学术界的一件大事。该院所藏旧版书特别丰富。据说，该院所藏的1800年前印的书只有5％可以在美国国会图书馆找到（该馆已有印本书目出版）。编印图书总目不是一件容易的事，德国的总书目只出了几册，在第二次世界大战前停刊，法国国民图书馆的图书总目出了半世纪尚未出齐，大英博物院如能在六、七年内把图书总目印出来，这将是对学术界的一个大贡献。
