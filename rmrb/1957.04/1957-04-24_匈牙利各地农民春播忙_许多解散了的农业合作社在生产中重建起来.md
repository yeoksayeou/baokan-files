    Hungarian Farmers Busy with Spring Planting
    Many Dissolved Agricultural Cooperatives are Being Rebuilt in Production
    Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, April 23rd: Spring planting work has been actively underway throughout Hungary, especially in the major agricultural areas of the Great Plain east of the Danube River and the Little Plain in northwestern Hungary.
    The sowing of corn, which began in mid-April, is expected to be completed by early May. This year, the country will plant 2.5 million holds (each hold is approximately 8.5 Chinese mu) of corn, about 500,000 holds more than last year.
    A person in charge of the Hungarian Ministry of Agriculture told reporters that this year's agricultural production in Hungary is better organized than in previous years. Although the October events of last year caused some losses to agricultural work, the impact was not significant. At present, there are 466 state-owned farms, 287 machine tractor stations, and more than 70 agricultural experiment stations in the country. They are playing a leading and promoting role in the spring plowing.
    The dissolved agricultural production cooperatives are also continuing to be rebuilt in production. At present, there are a total of 2,540 newly built and rebuilt agricultural production cooperatives in the country, including the original ones (there were more than 3,950 before the October events).
    After the abolition of the compulsory sales system, the production enthusiasm of farmers has been greatly improved, and deep plowing and careful cultivation have been carried out in many places. At the same time, the government has also distributed 150,000 tons of chemical fertilizers (only 71,000 tons were distributed last year), and the weather conditions this year are also relatively good. It is estimated that this year's grain output will increase compared to last year. (Attached picture)

    匈牙利各地农民春播忙
    许多解散了的农业合作社在生产中重建起来
    新华社布达佩斯23日电　在匈牙利全国各地，特别是在主要农业区多瑙河东部的大平原和匈牙利西北部的小平原，已经积极展开了春季播种工作。
    从4月中旬开始的玉蜀黍播种工作预计到5月初即可完成。今年全国将种植二百五十万霍尔特（每霍尔特约合八·五市亩）的玉蜀黍，即比去年约多种五十万霍尔特。
    匈牙利农业部负责人对记者说，匈牙利今年的农业生产工作比往年组织得好，去年的十月事件虽然使农业工作受到一些损失，但是影响不大。现在，全国有国营农场四百六十六个，机器拖拉机站二百八十七个，农业试验场七十多个。它们在春耕工作中起着带头和推动作用。
    解散了的农业生产合作社也在生产中继续重建起来。目前，全国新建，重建的农业生产合作社，连同原有的一起，共有二千五百四十个（十月事件前有三千九百五十多个）。
    义务交售制取消后，农民的生产情绪有了很大提高，许多地方进行了深耕细作。与此同时，政府还发放了十五万吨化学肥料（去年只发放了七万一千吨），加上今年的气候条件也比较好，估计今年的粮食产量将比去年有所增加。（附图片）
