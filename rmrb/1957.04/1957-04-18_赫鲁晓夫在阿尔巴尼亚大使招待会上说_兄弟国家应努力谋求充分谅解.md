Xinhua News Agency, April 17th dispatch: According to TASS reports: Khrushchev spoke at a reception held by the Albanian Ambassador to the Soviet Union on the 15th.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union will now and in the future do its utmost to make the friendship between the Soviet and Albanian people grow and consolidate. The Soviet Union and Albania, the two peoples, and the two parties are in complete agreement on political, economic, ideological, and international political issues. We should also strive to develop and strengthen the friendly relations between all socialist countries and strengthen the power of the great socialist camp.

Khrushchev then said that some people disagree with the concept of "socialist camp" and want to replace it with "cooperation" or other similar words. However, only the term "socialist camp" can most fully reflect the essence of relations between socialist countries in the context of the existence of two systems—the socialist and capitalist systems. As long as the two systems representing the two extremes still exist, there will inevitably be two opposing camps.

Khrushchev mentioned that in the development of friendly and cooperative relations between socialist countries, certain difficulties may sometimes be encountered. He said that we should calmly assess these difficulties and overcome them tenaciously. A few years ago, the relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia were once complicated. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government have been doing everything possible in the past and are doing so now to continuously improve relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia and between the two parties. At present, the relations between Albania and Yugoslavia are more difficult than the relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. We sincerely hope that these difficulties can be overcome, and that good-neighborly and friendly relations can be established between Albania and Yugoslavia. Of course, this requires a certain amount of time and requires both sides to have this desire and perseverance. In order to achieve full understanding and strengthen friendship on the basis of Marxist-Leninist principles, much persistent effort is needed, especially in overcoming difficulties on ideological issues. He said that we should not focus primarily on emphasizing the differences in our views on certain issues, but should focus on bringing the people of our countries closer to each other in the struggle for socialism and for the cause of consolidating peace. In this way, some of the gloom in our relationship with Yugoslavia will be cleared away. We firmly believe that our Albanian friends are in complete agreement with us on this issue. We hope that the people and leaders of Yugoslavia also have such a desire.

Speaking of the international situation, Khrushchev pointed out that the conspiracy of counter-revolutionaries and international reactionary forces to overthrow the Hungarian people's regime was crushed. Imperialism also suffered the deserved counterattack in its aggression against Egypt. At present, if the disaster has not been completely calmed, it has been significantly eased, and life is returning to normal. We should do everything possible to ease international tensions.

Khrushchev said that capitalist gentlemen blame us for both announcing the policy of peaceful coexistence and talking about the struggle between communist and bourgeois ideologies. Yes, this struggle is going on, reflecting the interests of different classes. This is also completely in accordance with the laws of development. Capitalists have their own views, beliefs, and evaluations of events. We communists have our own views and beliefs. Opposing the private ownership of the means of production, we build a new life based on socialist principles, and we uphold communist ideology. However, capitalist countries and socialist countries are on the same planet, which means that they should coexist and establish peaceful relations.

Imperialists blame us for concluding the Warsaw Pact. However, the Warsaw Pact was concluded because of the intensification of international relations and because capitalist countries established aggressive alliances and blocs such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Recent international events have shown that the forces of peace resolutely oppose any attempt to launch a new war. The people of all countries advocate peaceful coexistence. We, on our part, will continue to do everything possible to develop good relations between countries so that the people of each country can live according to their own wishes, creating a situation without the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, the Baghdad Pact, and the Warsaw Pact.

Khrushchev said that we never use force to impose communist ideas on others. We do not need to do so. Communist ideology has great vitality, and no weapons can destroy it. The attempts of imperialists to use force to prevent the spread of communist ideas are inevitably doomed to failure. Many lessons in history have shown this.

Khrushchev said that historical lessons tell us that in our era, it is impossible to use weapons to force people who are fighting for liberation to accept a system they loathe. If the capitalist gentlemen really want to help the people of backward countries, then let them help, but without war and without interfering in the internal affairs of these countries. But the people of underdeveloped countries must remember that capitalists do not give things away for nothing, because this is incompatible with the essence of capitalism. Khrushchev also condemned the "Eisenhower Doctrine" that the United States is touting and forcing the people of Middle Eastern countries to accept. He said that the United States did not consult the people of Middle Eastern countries when doing this, and their opinions are decisive.

Khrushchev pointed out that the countries of the socialist camp are strong in ideology and material strength. He said that we have the necessary armed forces to defend the fruits of socialism and protect the peaceful labor of the people. But we are willing to disarm on a larger scale, ban atomic and hydrogen weapons, and stop testing these weapons. We are willing to take all reasonable measures that are in the interests of peace-loving peoples and help consolidate the cause of world peace. I believe that one day, our just cause for fighting for peace will be victorious.

### 赫鲁晓夫在阿尔巴尼亚大使招待会上说  兄弟国家应努力谋求充分谅解

    赫鲁晓夫在阿尔巴尼亚大使招待会上说
    兄弟国家应努力谋求充分谅解
    据新华社17日讯  据塔斯社报道：赫鲁晓夫15日在阿尔巴尼亚驻苏联大使馆举行的招待会上讲了话。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联现在和将来都将竭力使苏阿两国人民的友谊日益增长和巩固。苏阿两国、两国人民和两国的党在政治、经济、思想和国际政治问题上的观点是完全一致的。我们还应当竭力发展和加强所有社会主义国家之间的友好关系，加强伟大社会主义阵营的威力。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，某些人士不同意“社会主义阵营”这个概念，想用“合作”或其他类似的字眼来代替它。但是，只有“社会主义阵营”这个名词才能最充分地反映在两个体系——社会主义和资本主义体系——存在的情况下社会主义各国关系的实质。只要代表两个极端的两种体系还存在，就不可避免地有两个对立的阵营存在。
    赫鲁晓夫谈到，在发展社会主义各国间的友好和合作关系中，有时也会遇到某种困难。他说，我们应当冷静地估计这种困难，并且顽强地克服它们。几年前，苏联同南斯拉夫的关系曾经一度复杂过。苏联共产党和苏联政府过去和现在都在尽一切力量来不断改善苏南两国和两党之间的关系。现在，阿尔巴尼亚同南斯拉夫之间的关系，和苏联同南斯拉夫之间的关系比较，是存在着更大的困难的。我们衷心希望这些困难能够克服，阿南两国之间能够建立睦邻、友好的关系。当然，这需要一定的时间，需要双方都有这种愿望和坚毅不拔的精神。为了在马克思列宁主义原则上取得充分谅解和加强友谊，需要作许多坚忍不拔的努力，特别是在克服思想问题上的困难方面。他说，我们不应该把主要注意力放在强调我们在某些问题上观点的分歧上面，而应该放在使我们这些国家的人民在为社会主义、为巩固和平事业的斗争中互相接近的上面。这样，我们同南斯拉夫关系中的一些黯淡的东西将会得到清除。我们深信，我们同阿尔巴尼亚的朋友们在这个问题上的观点也是完全一致的。我们希望南斯拉夫的人民和领导者也有这样的愿望。
    在谈到国际形势的时候，赫鲁晓夫指出，反革命和国际反动势力企图推翻匈牙利人民政权的阴谋被粉碎了。帝国主义在侵略埃及的事件中也遭到了应有的反击。目前，如果说灾难还没有完全平息，那么也是显著地和缓了，生活正在走上正轨。我们应当尽一切努力来缓和国际紧张局势。
    赫鲁晓夫说，资本家先生们责备我们既宣布和平共处政策，又谈论共产主义和资产阶级思想意识间的斗争。是的，这种斗争正在进行，它反映着不同阶级的利益。这也是完全合乎发展规律的。资本家对于事件有自己的观点、信仰和评价。我们共产主义者有我们自己的观点和信仰。反对生产资料的私有制，我们依据社会主义的原则建设新生活，我们维护共产主义思想。但是，资本主义国家和社会主义国家都是在一个星球上，这就意味着，应当共处，应当建立和平关系。
    帝国主义者责备我们缔结华沙条约。但是，华沙条约是由于国际关系的尖锐化，由于资本主义国家建立了像北大西洋公约组织等侵略性的联盟和集团才缔结的。最近的国际事件表明，和平力量坚决反对发动新战争的任何企图。各国人民主张和平共处。我们这方面今后仍将继续尽一切努力，以发展各国间的良好关系，使每个国家的人民都能按照他们自己的意愿去生活，造成没有北大西洋公约组织、东南亚条约组织、巴格达集团和华沙条约的局势。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们从来不用武力来把共产主义思想强加在别人头上。我们也不需要这样做。共产主义思想具有伟大的生命力，任何武器都不能消灭它。帝国主义者用武力来阻止共产主义思想传播的企图，不可避免地注定要遭到失败。历史上的许多教训都说明了这一点。
    赫鲁晓夫说，历史教训告诉我们，在我们的时代里，不可能用武器来强迫为争取解放而斗争的人民接受他们所厌恶的制度。如果资本家老爷当真想帮助落后国家人民，那么他们就帮助吧，只是不要有战争，不要干涉这些国家人民的内政。但是不发达国家的人民必须记住，资本家不会白送东西给人家，因为这是同资本主义的本质不相容的。赫鲁晓夫还谴责了美国正在吹嘘和强迫中东各国人民接受的“艾森豪威尔主义”。他说，美国这样作的时候，并没有征求中东各国人民的意见，而他们的意见才是具有决定意义的。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，社会主义阵营的国家在思想上和物质力量上都是强大的。他说，我们有必要的武装力量来保卫社会主义果实，保护人民的和平劳动。但是我们愿意更大规模地裁军，禁止原子武器和氢武器，并且停止试验这些武器。我们愿意采取一切符合爱好和平各国人民的利益、有助于巩固世界和平事业的合理措施。我相信，总有一天，我们为争取和平而斗争的正义事业会得到胜利。
