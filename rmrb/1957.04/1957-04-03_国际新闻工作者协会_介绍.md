    Introduction to the International Organization of Journalists
    The Executive Committee meeting of the International Organization of Journalists will be held in Beijing on April 3.
    The "International Organization of Journalists" was established at the International Journalists' Conference held in Copenhagen, Denmark in June 1946. At that time, 21 countries, including the Soviet Union, France, the United States, and the United Kingdom, participated in the organization. By the time the "International Organization of Journalists" held its second congress in Prague, Czechoslovakia in June 1947, it had more than 58,000 members, and news organizations from 24 countries, including the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, had joined the association. The congress passed a resolution by a majority vote to declare Prague as the location of the General Assembly Secretariat.
    After the Second Congress, the International Organization of Journalists was affected by the "Cold War" launched by the United Kingdom and the United States at that time. American news organizations began to boycott the association's activities and incited news organizations in Western countries to stop supporting its activities. The Executive Committee meeting held in Budapest in November 1948 pointed out the fact that some news organizations in Western countries did not implement the resolutions of the previous two congresses and condemned some American journalists for engaging in war propaganda. At this time, news organizations from the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries successively withdrew from the association.
      After suffering these setbacks, the "International Organization of Journalists" continued to work tirelessly to unite international journalists to jointly strive for world peace. The Third Congress was changed to be held in Helsinki. Participants included representatives from 30 countries. The conference resolved to approve the decisions already taken by the Executive Committee and passed a resolution that striving for peace is the responsibility of journalists. The conference decided that journalists from Western countries who agree with the aims of the association could participate in the International Organization of Journalists as individuals.
    In 1952, Western countries established the "International Federation of Journalists" in Brussels. This federation prohibits its members from participating in the activities of the International Organization of Journalists in order to resist the "International Organization of Journalists." In the spirit of cooperation, the "International Organization of Journalists" has repeatedly appealed to the "International Federation of Journalists" for negotiations and cooperation, but the International Federation of Journalists has refused to reply.
    The International Organization of Journalists has consistently strived for world peace and a better future for mankind, maintaining peace through free, truthful, and fair reporting, defending the freedom of the press and journalists, opposing the persecution of honest journalists, defending the rights of journalists, and striving to improve their material living conditions. Up to now, it has more than 60,000 members in 51 countries, making it the largest organization of journalists in the world.
    In 1954, in order to promote the unity of journalists around the world, more than 30 well-known journalists from more than 30 countries initiated a World Journalists' Conference. The International Organization of Journalists sponsored this proposal and gave it active support. This conference was held in Helsinki in June 1956 and was called the "International Journalists Meeting." More than 250 journalists from 44 countries participated in the meeting. The meeting passed a resolution emphasizing the strengthening of international contacts and cooperation among journalists.
    The chairman of the International Organization of Journalists is Ehrmann (France), the vice-chairmen are Kruminov (Soviet Union), Deng Tuo (China), and Mrs. Ridberg (Finland), and the secretary-general is Knobloch (Czechoslovakia). The address is located in Prague.

    “国际新闻工作者协会”介绍
    “国际新闻工作者协会”执行委员会会议将于4月3日在北京举行。
    “国际新闻工作者协会”是1946年6月在丹麦的哥本哈根召开的国际新闻工作者大会决定成立的。当时参加这个协会的有苏、法、美、英等二十一个国家。1947年6月“国际新闻工作者协会”在捷克斯洛伐克的布拉格召开第二届大会时，会员人数已有五万八千余人，苏、美、英、法、波、捷等二十四国的新闻组织都加入了协会。大会以大多数决议宣布以布拉格为大会秘书处的所在地。
    第二次大会后，国际新闻工作者协会受到当时英美发动“冷战”的影响。美国新闻组织开始抵制协会的活动，并怂恿西方国家的新闻组织停止支持它的活动。1948年11月在布达佩斯召开的执行委员会指出若干西方国家的新闻组织不执行前两届大会决议的事实，并谴责一些美国记者从事战争宣传。这时，美英等国新闻组织相继退出协会。
      “国际新闻工作者协会”在遭受到这些挫折以后，仍然坚持不懈地为团结国际新闻工作者共同争取世界和平而努力。第三届大会改在赫尔辛基召开。参加者有三十个国家的代表。大会决议批准执行委员会已采取的决定，并且通过了一项争取和平是新闻工作者职责的决议。大会决定，西方国家的记者如果赞同协会宗旨，可以个人身份参加国际新闻工作者协会。
    西方国家于1952年在布鲁塞尔成立“国际新闻工作者联合会”，这个联合会禁止它的会员参加国际新闻工作者协会的活动，来抵制“国际新闻工作者协会”。“国际新闻工作者协会”本着合作的精神，曾多次向“国际新闻工作者联合会”发出呼吁，要求谈判合作，但国际新闻工作者联合会都拒绝答复。
    国际新闻工作者协会一贯为争取世界和平与人类的美好未来，通过自由、真实、公正的报道来维护和平，保卫新闻和新闻工作者自由，反对对正直新闻记者的迫害，保卫记者的权利，争取改善他们的物质生活条件等而努力。到现在为止，它在五十一个国家中拥有六万多会员，成为世界上最大的一个新闻工作者的组织。
    1954年，为了促进世界新闻工作者的团结，有三十多个国家的三十多个著名记者发起举行一次世界记者大会，国际新闻工作者协会赞助这个建议，并予以积极支持。这次大会在1956年6月在赫尔辛基举行，名为“国际新闻工作者会见”。这次会见有四十四个国家的二百五十多名记者参加。会见通过了决议，强调加强记者的国际联系和合作。
    国际新闻工作者协会的主席是埃尔曼（法国），副主席是克拉米诺夫（苏联）、邓拓（中国）、里德堡夫人（芬兰），秘书长是克诺布洛赫（捷克斯洛伐克）。会址设在布拉格。
