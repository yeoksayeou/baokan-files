    历史上规模最大的国际体育比赛
    据新华社莫斯科1日电　在第六届世界青年联欢节期间举行的第三届国际青年友谊运动会将是历史上规模最大的一次国际性体育比赛。运动会的组织委员会已经向八十六个国家的奥林匹克委员会和十七个国际体育运动协会发出邀请。
    从今年7月29日到8月10日在莫斯科举行的这次运动会的比赛项目和规模将超过历届奥林匹克运动会。大会的项目中包括男子二十四项运动和女子十五项运动。其中排球、网球、女子篮球、乒乓球、手球、橄榄球以及女子四百公尺和八百公尺赛跑都是去年奥林匹克运动会中没有的项目。运动会还要组织民族形式体育的表演和比赛。例如运动员可以在莫斯科表演高尔夫球、垒球、板球等。
    预计将有五千多名世界上优秀运动员参加比赛。而参加去年奥林匹克运动会的只有四千多人。1955年在华沙举行青年联欢节时，参加体育比赛的只有三千五百多人。
    据最近获得的消息，已经有许多世界闻名的运动员表示愿意参加这次运动会。其中有世界纪录保持者、奥林匹克冠军斯特里克兰（澳大利亚）、奥林匹克撑竿跳冠军理查兹（美国）、世界标枪纪录创造者丹尼尔森（挪威）和奥林匹克马拉松赛跑冠军米蒙（法国）等。
    运动会的组织委员会最近已经确定了各个项目的比赛地点。莫斯科将划出十六所最大的体育场所供运动会比赛之用。
