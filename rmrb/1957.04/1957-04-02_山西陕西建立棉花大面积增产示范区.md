    The Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture has decided to establish over 880,000 mu of cotton production increase demonstration zones in 21 counties (cities) in the Guanzhong area, requiring each mu to produce 200-370 jin of seed cotton. The Shanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture recently decided to establish 700,000 mu of cotton production increase demonstration zones in the Jinnan and Jinzhong areas, striving to achieve an average yield of over 90 jin of ginned cotton per mu. To ensure the realization of this task, the two provinces have also decided that each county will establish a Production Increase Demonstration Work Committee, responsible for formulating work plans for the production increase demonstration cotton areas, regularly solving relevant problems, and summarizing and exchanging experiences; designated local agricultural experiment stations and technology promotion stations as the core of technical guidance, and required them to take the first step in technical measures, create experience, and achieve the purpose of demonstration and promotion, driving the overall situation.
