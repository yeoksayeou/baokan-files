    Improve the Feeding and Management of Draught Animals

    In this year's spring plowing, many places have an insufficient number of draught animals, and their quality is too poor, making it difficult to adapt to the requirements of large-scale production. According to incomplete statistics from Jiangsu Province, more than 60,000 draught animals died throughout the province last winter and this spring. Among the existing draught animals, the weak and thin account for about 40% of the total, and in individual counties, this figure reaches 70%. Shandong Province estimates that old, weak, disabled, and inferior draught animals account for 30% of the total. Shaanxi is a province that produces livestock, but the province is also short of 400,000 draught animals. Wuwu County in Anhui Province is short of more than 15,000 draught cattle this spring. In Anxi County, Gansu Province, more than 2,000 draught animals died this spring, affecting preparatory work and spring plowing production.

    There are many reasons for the weakness and death of draught animals, the most important of which are poor feeding last year, excessive labor, and lack of good rest in winter. Last year was the first year after cooperation, and various regions universally adopted many measures to increase production, such as applying more fertilizer, using new farm implements, deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, and expanding the area of multiple cropping, all of which required more animal power. In some areas, each draught animal used to work only 120 to 180 days a year, while last year most worked about 300 days. In some places in the south, the method of "resting people but not cattle" was adopted, plowing during the day and operating waterwheels at night. Under such increased labor, feeding and management work did not keep up. Many cooperatives lacked the material conditions for collective feeding of draught animals, and the feeders lacked experience in managing large numbers of draught animals. In order to show the superiority of advanced cooperatives, they blindly pursued centralized forms, concentrating dozens to hundreds of draught animals in very simple animal sheds, or even in the open air. Draught animals, regardless of size or sex, were crowded together, and the strong were able to grab more food, while the small and weak were often not full. Some animal sheds were very small, and the animals could only stand, not lie down. This inevitably led to poor feeding, and diseases spread easily. Last year, most cooperatives had just transitioned to advanced cooperatives and had many urgent matters to deal with, so they did not have time to formulate a relatively reasonable system for feeding and managing draught animals. Feeding and usage were disconnected, and the cooperative members' care for draught animals was not as good as in the past, focusing only on use and not on maintenance. In addition, some places lacked forage and feed, which caused a considerable number of draught animals to lose weight and become weak, unable to withstand wind and rain.

    In January of this year, the Ministry of Agriculture convened a national draught animal conference, calling on all regions to quickly reverse the phenomenon of weakness and death of draught animals. In mid-March, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued instructions on the issue of draught animals. The situation of draught animals in many places has begun to improve. However, it has not fundamentally improved. The phenomena of weakness and death have not stopped in some places. Now is the busy season for spring plowing, and if the feeding, management, and use of draught animals are not actively improved, the call to strive for a bumper harvest this year is in danger of failing.

    The primary link in improving feeding and management is to formulate reasonable feeding and usage systems, combining feeding and usage. In general, those who feed draught animals always hope that the draught animals will grow fat and strong and not work too hard; while those who use draught animals always hope that the draught animals will work quickly and do more work, so that they can earn more work points. This contradiction needs to be unified. One way is to unify it in one person, with the person responsible for feeding also responsible for using. Another way is for the feeder and the user to have a clear handover system, clarifying responsibilities and restraining each other. The Qianjin No. 1 Cooperative in Wugong County, Shaanxi Province, gave the feeder certain powers: when using draught animals, the feeder can allocate animal power according to the needs of agricultural work, not allowing cooperative members to arbitrarily choose the larger ones; when returning draught animals, if they are overused, overworked, or injured, the feeder can refuse to return them to the stall. This method has played a significant role in protecting draught animals.

    Reasonable remuneration is the material basis for ensuring the implementation of various systems. Draught animals vary in size and speed, and it takes the same effort to use the big and fast ones as it does to use the small and slow ones, but the amount of work done is not the same. If remuneration is calculated only based on the amount of work done, everyone will inevitably compete to use the big and fast ones. The Taiyangsheng Agricultural Cooperative in Fangcheng County, Henan Province, initially had the same labor quota for all types of draught animals. Cooperative members using pregnant cows could not reach the quota and were deducted work points. As a result, the cooperative bred 100 fewer young animals. Including weakness and death, the total loss was nearly 10,000 yuan. With insufficient animal power, they had to use manpower to pull carts and plows. Later, different labor quotas were set according to the different physical strength of each draught animal. Regardless of which draught animal was used, as long as the quota was reached, the remuneration received was the same. Exceeding the quota but exhausting the draught animal did not result in more points and was subject to criticism. With such a clear remuneration method, coupled with other measures, the phenomenon of draught animal weakness and death was eliminated within half a year. This experience can be used as a reference for various regions.

    The quality of the feeder is closely related to how well draught animals are fed. Therefore, it is necessary to select people who are active, responsible, and experienced to take on the role. The Qianjin No. 1 Cooperative in Wugong County not only carefully selected feeders but also educated cooperative members to respect the labor of the feeders and care for their lives. Everyone cared about the feeders, and the feeders were particularly passionate about their work. The cadres of the Qianjin No. 1 Cooperative took time during festivals to have a couple of drinks and chat with the feeders, and arranged for the feeders to take turns going to fairs. These may seem like small things, but they were a great encouragement to the feeders. Many cooperatives often neglect these small things and delay important matters.

    Protecting draught animals is not only the business of the feeders but also the business of all cooperative members. After agricultural cooperation, many cooperative members believed that the draught animals were no longer their own, and therefore, they did not care enough for them. In order to change this phenomenon, it is necessary to conduct in-depth ideological education for cooperative members, making them understand the close relationship between protecting draught animals and the production and personal income of the entire cooperative. Only when the awareness of cooperative members is raised can good systems be truly implemented.

    Is it better to feed draught animals collectively or separately? This depends on the specific conditions. However, cooperatives that do not have the conditions for collective feeding or that do not feed well collectively and do not have a firm grasp of rapid improvement should implement separate feeding – public ownership and private feeding or private ownership and private feeding are both acceptable.

    Some cooperatives have limited funds and cannot build many animal sheds and add many utensils all at once; while in the homes of cooperative members who originally had draught animals, there is a lot of equipment lying idle. These cooperative members also have experience in feeding draught animals. If this part of the equipment and manpower can be utilized, the difficulty of insufficient animal sheds and equipment can be greatly solved. Some places have already begun to adopt the method of separate feeding. However, some cooperatives are afraid to implement separate feeding. They think that separate feeding of draught animals is not socialist; this idea is wrong. The number of draught animals in our country is very small, averaging less than one per household. Even if all are privately owned by cooperative members, it will not change the nature of agricultural cooperatives; as for public ownership and private feeding, it does not involve this issue even more. Separate feeding and centralized use will have certain contradictions. However, as long as the system and remuneration are reasonably set and cooperative members are regularly educated to care for draught animals, this contradiction can be resolved.

    We are not advocating that all cooperatives that do not feed draught animals well, regardless of the reason or conditions, should redistribute the draught animals that have already been centralized. The question is how to ensure that draught animals are well fed, and there can be many ways to do this. Within the same region, different cooperatives with different conditions should not be forced to be uniform.

### 改善耕畜的饲养管理

    改善耕畜的饲养管理
    今年春耕生产中，许多地方耕畜数量不够，质量太差，很难适应大生产的要求。据江苏省不完全的统计，去冬今春全省死掉耕畜六万多头，现有耕畜中瘦弱的要占总数40％左右，个别县份占70％。山东省估计全省老、弱、残、劣的耕畜占总数30％。陕西是出产牲畜的省份，但全省也缺役畜四十万头。安徽省无为县今年春耕中缺少一万五千多头耕牛。甘肃安西县今春死了两千多头耕畜，备耕工作和春耕生产受了影响。
    造成耕畜瘦弱和死亡的原因很多，最主要的是去年喂养得不好，过度劳动，冬季又没有很好的休息。去年是合作化以后的第一年，各地普遍采用了许多增产措施，如多施肥料，用新式农具，深耕细作，扩大复种面积等等，都需要多用畜力。有些地区过去每头耕畜一年只出工一百二十天到一百八十天，而去年大部分都出工三百天左右。南方有的地方还采用歇人不歇牛的办法，白天耕地，晚上车水。在这样加重使役的情况下，饲养管理工作却没有跟上去。许多社既缺少集体喂养耕畜的物质条件，饲养员又没有经管大批耕畜的经验，而为了显示高级社的优越性，就盲目追求形式上的集中，把数十头至上百头的耕畜集中在很简陋的畜舍里，甚至放在露天里。耕畜不分大小公母都挤在一起，体大力强的能抢到更多的食料，小的弱的经常吃不饱。有的畜舍很小，牲畜在里面只能站不能卧。这样必然喂不好，有了疾病也很容易传播。去年大部分社都刚转成高级社，有许多紧急的事要处理，来不及订出一套比较合理的耕畜饲养管理制度，喂和用脱节，而社员对耕畜的爱护程度也不如过去，只顾使用，不顾护养。再加上有的地方饲草、饲料不够，就使得相当多的耕畜退膘瘦弱，经不起风吹雨打。
    今年一月份农业部召开了全国耕畜会议，号召各地迅速扭转耕畜瘦弱和死亡的现象。三月中旬中共中央和国务院又发出了关于耕畜问题的指示。许多地方耕畜的情况已经开始有了好转。但是还没有根本好转。有的地方瘦弱和死亡的现象还没有停止。现在已到春耕大忙时节，再不积极改善耕畜的饲养管理和使用，争取今年大丰收的号召就有落空的危险。
    改进饲养管理的首要环节，是制定合理的喂养制度和使用制度，把养和用结合起来。在一般情况下，饲养耕畜的人总是希望耕畜长得肥壮，做活不要过累；而使用耕畜的人又总是希望耕畜做活又快又多，使自己多挣工分。这个矛盾需要统一。一个办法是统一在一个人身上，负责饲养的人也负责使用。另一个办法是饲养的人和使用的人有明确的交接制度，分清责任，相互有所约束。陕西武功县前进一社交给饲养员一定的权力：用耕畜时饲养员根据农活需要搭配畜力，不让社员任意挑大的用；交还耕畜时，有使用过度、受累受伤的，可以拒绝归槽。这一个办法对保护耕畜起了很大的作用。
    合理的报酬，是保证各项制度贯彻执行的物质基础。耕畜有大有小，有快有慢，用大的、快的和用小的、慢的同样费力，做的活却不一样多。如果只按做活多少来计算报酬，必然会大家都争着用大的、快的。河南方城县太阳升农业社起初是各种耕畜的劳役定额都一样，用孕牛的社员做活达不到定额，还扣了工分。这样做的结果，全社少繁殖一百头幼畜。加上瘦弱死亡，一共损失将近一万元。畜力不够，还要用人力来拉车拉犁。后来根据每头耕畜不同的体力，定出不同的劳役定额，不论使用那头耕畜，只要达到定额，所得到的报酬就一样多。超过定额，但累坏了耕畜的，不多记分，还要批评。有了这样明确的报酬办法，再加上其他一些措施，半年之后就消灭了耕畜瘦弱上抬的现象。这个经验可供各地参考。
    耕畜喂得好坏，和饲养员的质量有很大关系。因此必须挑选积极负责而有经验的人去担任。武功县前进一社不但认真挑选了饲养员，还教育社员尊重饲养员的劳动、关心饲养员的生活。大家都关怀饲养员，饲养员也就格外热爱自己的工作。前进一社的干部逢年过节抽空和饲养员喝两盅酒、谈谈心，调剂人力让饲养员轮流去赶会，这些看起来好像是小事，但是对饲养员却是很大的鼓舞。许多社往往正是忽视了这些小事而贻误了大事。
    保护耕畜并不光是饲养员的事，也是全体社员的事。农业合作化以后，许多社员认为耕畜不是自己的了，因此，对耕畜爱护不够。为了改变这种现象，必须对社员进行深入的思想教育，使社员们了解保护耕畜对全社生产和个人收入的密切关系。只有社员觉悟提高，好的制度才能真正贯彻执行。
    耕畜集中喂养好呢？还是分散喂养好？这要看具体条件决定。但是如果没有条件集中喂养或者集中喂养不好而又没有确实把握迅速改善的合作社，就应该实行分散喂养——公有私养或者私有私养都可以。
    有的社资金有限，一下子不可能建设很多畜舍，添置很多用具；而在原来有耕畜的社员家中，却有不少设备闲放着不用。这些社员原来也都有喂养耕畜的经验。如果能把这一部分设备和人力利用起来，就能在很大程度上解决畜舍和设备不足的困难。现在有些地方已经开始采用分散喂养的方法。但也有些社不敢分散喂养。他们以为耕畜分散喂养就不是社会主义了；这个想法是不对的。我国耕畜数量很少，平均每户还不到一头，即使都归社员私有，也不会改变农业合作社的性质；至于公有私养，就更不牵涉这个问题了。分散喂养和集中使用会有一定的矛盾。但是只要制度和报酬订得合理，再经常向社员进行爱护耕畜的教育，这个矛盾是能够解决的。
    我们并不是提倡所有耕畜喂得不好的社，无论是什么原因什么条件，都把已经集中起来的耕畜重新分散。问题是怎样保证把耕畜喂好，具体做法可以多种多样。在同一地区内，不同条件的社也不能强求划一。
