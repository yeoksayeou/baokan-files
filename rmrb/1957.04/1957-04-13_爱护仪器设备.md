Dalian Institute of Technology inspected the waste of instruments and equipment in the past year. The Department of Chemical Engineering of the school damaged more than 6,000 instruments in one year, worth more than 5,000 yuan. Among them, the dye and organic laboratories were more seriously damaged. Last year, a total of more than 3,900 instruments were damaged, worth about 2,200 yuan. At the same time, the damage of valuable instruments is also very serious. Last year, the whole institute damaged instruments worth more than 15,000 yuan. This has brought significant economic losses to the country. This situation is not an isolated case, and many college students also have the phenomenon of not cherishing instruments. Teachers and students of all schools should cherish instruments and equipment, strengthen maintenance, abide by the experimental operating procedures, try to reduce instrument damage, and improve the utilization rate.

    爱护仪器设备
    大连工学院曾检查去年一年中仪器设备的浪费现象。该校化工系一年就损坏仪器六千多件，价值五千多元。其中较严重的是染料和有机两个试验室，去年共损坏三千九百多件仪器，约值二千二百多元。同时贵重仪器的破损情况也很严重。去年全院共破损仪器约值一万五千元以上。这样给国家带来了重大的经济损失。这种情况不是个别的，不少高等学校学生也有不爱护仪器的现象。各学校师生都应当爱护仪器设备，加强保养，遵守试验操作规程，尽量减少仪器的损坏情况，提高使用率。　（山）
