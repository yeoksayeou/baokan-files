    Performance of "Peking Man"
    Feng Yidai
    Of all of Mr. Cao Yu's plays, "Peking Man" is my favorite. Not only because of the play's poetic language and poetic mood, but also because the playwright's writing skills have reached a mature peak in this play; but what mainly attracts me is the playwright's strong and clear love and hate expressed through the plot for life. In the once-renowned, now faded small living room of the Zeng family, life is imprisoned. One generation recalls the past glory, but can only await death; another generation regrets the mistakes of their youth, and helplessly reminisces about the lost years and broken dreams; yet another generation is unwilling to accept the stagnant and confined life, holding onto the hope of rushing towards a new world. However, the constraints of life keep these poor creatures gathered in this small living room. Is life limited to these dim walls? Don't people want to take a step out to breathe in the fresh air, to kiss human happiness? But breaking through the many obstacles of this life requires fearless courage, and understanding this is not easy, as Zeng Ting said, "This understanding is so difficult!" The playwright truly feels indignant for them, and borrows the words of the anthropologist Yuan Rengan to strongly condemn this weak generation. Yuan Rengan tells everyone how "Peking Man" once lived, he says: "These are the ancestors of mankind, and also the hope of mankind. People at that time loved when they wanted to love, hated when they wanted to hate, cried when they wanted to cry, shouted when they wanted to shout, unafraid of death, unafraid of life..." In comparison, people living like little mice should be ashamed of their ancestors! But the playwright did not despair because of this. Let the cowardly rot in the soil, mold in the house, let the brave run out of this cage-like small living room and move towards a broad life. His confidence in life also infected us, so we have no sympathy for Zeng Hao, Si Yi, Jiang Tai, and Wen Cai, but we have endless sympathy for Wen Qing, Su Fang, Rui Zhen, and Zeng Ting.
    In this performance, the playwright has revised the original work. The absence of "Peking Man" avoids the overly legendary atmosphere of the story, showing the reality of life, and some dialogue deletions (especially the ending of the first act) also make the plot more compact and concise.
    From the performance, we saw the director's careful understanding of the original work. On the stage, he grasped the requirements of the atmosphere and rendered it appropriately. On one side is the rigid formation laid down by decay and decline - a dying struggle, seeking hope in hopelessness; on the other side is the attack of the new generation and new life on this feudal fortress. He emphasized the old generation's persistent adherence to the old life, which showed the new forces to be even more courageous and wild. Yuan Yuan's appearance and her innocent play with Zeng Ting; Si Yi's repeated advances towards Wen Qing; the soul-stirring emotions between Wen Qing and Su Fang; Su Fang's agreement to marry; Zeng Hao's stroke; Jiang Tai's sudden and unexpected trip to borrow money; Wen Qing's quiet return; Su Fang's shattered dream, and the final few scenes of departure, were all handled very appropriately. Naturally, the original's wonderful depiction helped the director's arrangement, but the director's ability to develop the plot shows that he put in a lot of hard work. However, the shortcoming lies in his handling of the contrast of characters, the conflict of personalities, and the rhythm of the whole play. Taking the scene of Su Fang's agreement to marry as an example, Si Yi hopes that Su Fang can marry as soon as possible, so that there will be one less emotional competitor in front of her, Zeng Hao hopes that Su Fang will stay to adorn his desolate old age, Jiang Tai can't stand this selfish trick, and righteously tears off their masks. But what about Wen Qing? The director neglected his emotional contradiction towards Su Fang in the venting in this scene, and also neglected the reaction that Wen Cai should have in sympathizing with the relationship between Wen Qing and Su Fang, which reduced the power of the conflict reaching its climax, and also weakened the悲怆 of Su Fang's last sentence "I, I didn't mean anything". Also, in order to create the atmosphere on the stage, the director tried to suppress the characters' emotions to the lowest point, but sometimes forgot to intensify the eruption of the characters' emotions, especially in Wen Qing, he did not arrange well his different emotions towards Si Yi and Su Fang in different scenes and different contacts, so the rhythm of the play seemed to never have a musical change, and it all seemed gloomy.
    Among the actors, we had a pleasant discovery, that is, Li Xiaolan who played Su Fang. The Su Fang in the playwright's pen can be said to be the pinnacle of life's poetry, the crystallization of virtue. On the stage, she doesn't say much, but she also says the most. Her words are expressed in her flexible eyes, in her tactful actions, and even in the trembling of her shoulders when she cries. Nowadays, it is difficult to find a character like Su Fang in different eras, so when a role appears on the stage that is just like the one shaped by the playwright, we have to express our admiration for this actor. I like the scene she played of Su Fang narrating her beautiful dream to Rui Zhen the most. From her unwillingness to speak but having to speak, speaking and not being able to stop the throbbing in her heart, from helplessness to true joy, in front of her is the rolling river of emotion, and suddenly "the sky fell"! In that instant, she came out of the shattered dream, she was another Su Fang. Li Xiaolan powerfully grasped this point, allowing the audience to enter the dream with her, shatter with her, and be reborn with her. It is said that she has been suppressed in a large theater for a long time, which is really a pity. If she could have had more stage practice in the past four or five years, her talent should have been able to develop more. Mei Cun's Si Yi performed the narrow-mindedness, greed, and viciousness of the older generation of women. But she has a weak side, that is, her fear of life, and the eccentricity in her personality is a说明 of her distress; neglecting this only sees her sternness, but not her pity. Wang Xian, who played Wen Qing, has enough of the upset and resignation, but still lacks the expression of his attachment to life, and his kind of unrestrained mood. Ji Weishi's Jiang Tai is just right. Wang Changming's Zeng Hao, then the inner expression is not enough.
    This play is the first public performance of the Central People's Broadcasting Station Broadcasting Troupe, but from their serious attitude towards the performance, we can place more expectations on them.

    “北京人”的演出
    冯亦代
    曹禺先生写的剧本中，我最喜欢“北京人”。不仅由于剧本中的诗的语言和诗的情调，而且由于剧作者的写作技巧在这个剧本里已经到达圆熟的峰巅；但主要吸引我的，却是剧作者透过剧情，对于生活所表达的强烈鲜明的爱憎。在曾家那间曾经喧赫一时、如今已显灰颓的小花厅里，生活被幽囚着。一代人追忆昔日繁华，眼前只能等候死日的来临；另一代人痛心于少年时的错着，无可奈何地缅想那逝去的岁月和残破的梦境；再一代人则不甘心于死气沉沉的禁锢生活，抱着冲向新天地去的企望。可是生活的羁绊，却使这些可怜虫群集在这间小花厅里。难道生活只限于这黯淡的四壁之中？难道人们就不想迈出一步去呼吸一下清新空气，亲一下人间幸福？不过冲出这一生活的重重障碍却需要无畏的勇气，要明白这一点，却也不是件易事，正如曾霆所说的“这明白是多难哪！”剧作者真替他们感到气愤，他借人类学者袁任敢的话，对于这孱弱的一代人，痛加谴责。袁任敢告诉大家“北京人”曾经如何生活，他说：“这是人类的祖先，这也是人类的希望。那时候的人要爱就爱，要恨就恨，要哭就哭，要喊就喊，不怕死，也不怕生……”对比之下，像小耗子样生活着的人真该愧对祖先！但是剧作者却没有就此失望。让卑怯者烂在土里、霉在屋里，让大勇者跑出这囚笼似的小花厅走向宽广的生活去。他对生活的信心也感染了我们，因此对曾皓、思懿、江泰、文彩之辈我们无所顾惜，而对文清、愫芳、瑞贞、曾霆却寄以无限的同情。
    这次演出，剧作者对于原作曾加修整。“北京人”的不出场，使故事免于过重的传奇气氛，显示了生活的真实，而一些对话的删节
  （特别是第一幕的收尾），也使剧情格外紧凑简洁。
    从演出里，我们看到了导演对于原作的潜心体会之处。在舞台上，他抓住了气氛的要求，加以适度的渲染。一面是陈腐衰亡所列下的严阵——垂死的挣扎，在无望中寻求希望；一面则是新的一代和新的生活对这座封建堡垒的进攻。他强调了老一代旧生活的执着的固守，也就显出了新的力量更为勇猛，更为犷野。袁圆的出场和她与曾霆的天真嬉戏；思懿对文清的多处进迫；文清与愫芳的荡气回肠的情感；愫芳说嫁；曾皓中风；江泰的奇峰突起的出外借钱；文清的悄然归来；愫芳的梦的破灭，以及最后出走的几场戏，都处理得十分妥贴。自然，原作的精采描绘，有助于导演的安排，但导演能够就剧情的进展，加以发挥，可以看见他是下了苦功的。不过，缺陷在于他在处理人物的对比、性格的冲突和全剧的节奏上。以愫芳说嫁一场戏为例，思懿希望愫芳能够早日出嫁，可以在眼前少一个感情上的竞争者，曾皓希望愫芳留下来点缀他的凄凉老境，江泰看不过这场自私的把戏，正义地撕下了他们的假面具。然而文清呢？导演疏忽了他对愫芳的感情矛盾在这场戏中的宣泄，也疏忽了文彩在同情文清、愫芳二人关系中应有的反应，这样就减少了冲突上达顶点的力量，也削弱了愫芳最后说“我，我没有意思”那句话的悲怆。又如导演为了造成舞台上的气氛，尽量把人物感情压到最低处，却有时忘掉了，加意渲染人物感情的爆发，特别在文清身上，没有很好地安排他对思懿和愫芳在不同场面不同接触时的不同感情，因此戏的节奏似乎永远没有音乐上的变调，显得都是幽沉沉的了。
    演员中，我们有了个可喜的发现，那就是演愫芳的李晓蓝。剧作者笔下的愫芳，可说是生活的诗的顶点，美德的结晶。在舞台上她说话不多，却也说话最多。她的话表现在灵活的眼神中，表现在委婉的行动中，甚至表现在她哭泣时的双肩抽动中。如今，不同的时代里很难找到愫芳这一型的人物，因此在舞台上出现了一如剧作者笔下所塑造的角色时，我们不得不对这位演员，说出我们的钦慕。我最喜欢她演的愫芳和瑞贞叙述自己美梦的那场戏。从她不愿说又不得不说，说了又止不住自己心头的悸动，从无可奈何到真正的喜悦，在她前面就是那条滚滚不息的感情的河流，而突然“天塌了”！就在这一瞬间，她从幻灭的梦里出来，她是另一个愫芳了。李晓蓝有力地掌握了这一点，使看戏的人跟她进入梦中，跟她幻灭，跟她新生。据说她曾经长期被积压在一个大剧院里，真令人婉惜，如果四、五年来她能有更多的舞台实践，她的才能是该有更多发挥的。梅村的思懿，演出了老一代妇女的狭隘、贪鄙、狠毒。但是她有软弱的一面，那就是她对于生活的恐惧，性格上的乖张，正是她苦恼的说明；忽视了这一点，就只见她的严酷，而不见她的可怜了。演文清的王显，心烦意乱和逆来顺受足够了，却还缺少表白他对生活的依恋，和他那种洒脱倜傥的心情。纪维时演的江泰恰如其分。王昌明的曾皓，则内心的表达还嫌不够。
    这出戏是中央人民广播电台广播剧团的初次公演，但从他们演出的认真严肃态度说来，我们是可以寄予更多的期望的。
