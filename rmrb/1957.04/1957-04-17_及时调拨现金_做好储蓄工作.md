Timely Allocation of Cash
    Do a Good Job in Savings
    The Sanmenxia Water Control Project has started, and the ideal of "the Yellow River will be clear" is about to be realized, which will bring great happiness to the people of our country. However, as the People's Daily editorial on April 14 pointed out: Sanmenxia is located in a mountainous area far from existing cities. To ensure the supply of living necessities and convenience for technical cadres and workers on the construction site, support from all aspects is needed. In terms of the People's Bank, the main tasks are as follows: (1)做好 Cash allocation should be done well to facilitate the timely payment of employee wages and cash payments for piecemeal purchases of raw materials at the construction site; (2)做好 Commercial loans should be well managed to provide funds for commercial departments to organize commodity supply, especially the commodity reserves needed for daily necessities and non-staple foods; (3)做好 Short-term loans should be made to local industries and handicrafts related to the construction site; (4)做好 Savings work should be done well to serve the vast number of employees at the construction site, so that they can deposit and withdraw money conveniently and satisfactorily. Doing the above work well is our People's Bank contributing to the great Yellow River control cause. (People's Bank of China Headquarters)

    及时调拨现金
    做好储蓄工作
    三门峡水利枢纽工程动工了，“河清有日”的理想要实现了，它将给我国人民带来巨大的幸福。可是，正如人民日报4月14日社论指出的：三门峡处在一个距原有城市较远的山区，要保证工地技术干部和工人的生活供应和便利，需要各方面支援。在人民银行方面，主要是做好下列四方面的工作：（一）做好现金调拨，以便利工地及时发放职工工资及支付零星采买原材料的现金支付；（二）做好商业放款工作，为便利商业部门组织商品供应、特别是日用品及副食品供应所需要的商品储备提供资金；（三）做好和支援工地有关的地方工业、手工业的短期放款工作；（四）做好储蓄工作，为工地广大职工同志们服务，使他们存钱取钱都很方便、满意。做好上述这些工作，就是我们人民银行为伟大的治黄事业尽了一份力量。　（中国人民银行总行）
