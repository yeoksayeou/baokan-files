Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, April 4th. If a large steel plant is to be built at the Panzhihua iron mine, will the auxiliary raw materials needed for smelting steel in the vicinity be sufficient? A person in charge of the Sichuan Provincial Geological Bureau's Ferrous Metallurgical Auxiliary Raw Materials Team told Xinhua reporters:

"Yes!".

This team recently conducted a survey in several counties around Panzhihua and proved that this area contains abundant main auxiliary raw materials needed for smelting steel, such as limestone, dolomite, quartzite and refractory clay; some surface outcrops are as long as thirty kilometers and more than three hundred meters wide. According to visual estimates, the reserves are sufficient to provide for smelting all the iron ore reserves in Panzhihua. Except for refractory clay, the other three auxiliary raw materials have recently been tested, and their grades are quite high, meeting national requirements.

Currently, this team is preparing a preliminary survey design for auxiliary raw materials based on the materials already obtained, in preparation for detailed exploration.

    攀枝花附近  有辅助原料吗？
    新华社成都4日电　假若要在攀枝花铁矿建立大型钢铁厂，附近蕴藏的冶炼钢铁的辅助原料够吗？四川省地质局黑色冶金辅助原料队有关负责人告诉新华社记者说：
    “够！”。
    这个队不久前在攀枝花外围的几个县进行踏勘，证明这一带蕴藏有丰富的冶炼钢铁所需的主要辅助原料石灰岩、白云岩、石英岩和耐火粘土等；有的地面出露长达三十公里，宽在三百公尺以上。据目测，储量足以提供冶炼攀枝花蕴藏的全部铁矿矿石。除了耐火粘土以外，其它三种辅助原料最近都经过化验，它们的品位都相当高，合于国家要求。
    现在，这个队正在根据已获材料做辅助原料的普查设计，准备详细勘探。
