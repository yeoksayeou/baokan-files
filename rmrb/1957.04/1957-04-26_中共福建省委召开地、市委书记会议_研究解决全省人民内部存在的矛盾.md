The CPC Fujian Provincial Committee Holds Meeting of Prefectural and Municipal Party Secretaries to Study and Resolve Contradictions Among the People in the Province

Fuzhou, April 24th (This newspaper's report) - The CPC Fujian Provincial Committee recently convened a meeting of prefectural and municipal Party secretaries. After relaying Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference regarding the correct handling of contradictions among the people, and Chairman Mao's speech at the national conference on propaganda work, the meeting engaged in enthusiastic discussions.

Participants unanimously supported Chairman Mao's instructions on the correct handling of contradictions among the people. Everyone believed that certain errors and shortcomings in past work were caused by the failure to correctly distinguish the boundaries between contradictions between ourselves and the enemy and internal contradictions, and the boundaries between dictatorship and democracy. However, Fujian is located on the coastal defense front, facing Jinmen and Taiwan, and there are still remnants of counter-revolutionaries. We should not neglect contradictions between ourselves and the enemy and cannot relax our vigilance against the enemy.

The meeting conducted a preliminary analysis of the current contradictions among the people in the province. It demanded that Party committees at all levels resolutely implement the policy of taking grain as the key link while comprehensively developing production. At present, efforts should be made to vigorously lead farmers in doing a good job in spring plowing and production, and striving for a bumper grain harvest this year. In terms of agricultural production plans, the principle of giving agricultural cooperatives the right to maneuver under the guidance of state plans should be firmly implemented, so as to facilitate agricultural cooperatives in arranging production in accordance with local conditions, thereby ensuring the realization of the policy of comprehensively developing production. The meeting demanded that Party committees at all levels comprehensively strengthen the leadership of economic work, improve the situation of production and sales, coordinate industry and commerce relations, and resolve the contradictions between rural sideline production and urban handicraft production. At the same time, the price policy for the purchase of agricultural products should be correctly implemented, the mass line should be implemented in the purchase process, and the phenomenon of squeezing prices at each level should be corrected.

The meeting called for vigorously strengthening ideological work, with the first secretaries of Party committees at all levels personally grasping ideological work. Within the cadre ranks, rectification, Party consolidation, and commune consolidation should continue to be carried out to overcome subjectivism, bureaucratism, and sectarianism, and to establish a work style of seeking truth from facts and following the mass line. The people should be educated in socialism, collectivism, and democratic centralism. By strengthening political and ideological work, the democratic style should be fully promoted, the masses' political awareness should be raised, thereby strengthening unity within the people, and improving Party-masses relations and cadre-masses relations.

The meeting required all departments to comprehensively and systematically analyze internal contradictions in their respective fields on the basis of studying Chairman Mao's instructions, and to propose solutions.

The meeting reviewed the implementation of the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" in the province. The meeting believed that although academic discussions had been preliminarily launched in universities, various traditional operas had been staged, and articles of contention had begun to appear in newspapers and periodicals, the "blooming" was still far from sufficient in general. The meeting demanded that Party committees at all levels educate cadres, recognize the importance of this policy, correct their thinking, eliminate their worries, and resolutely implement this policy in order to seek the development and prosperity of science, literature and art.

Finally, the meeting studied and arranged how to do a good job in conveying and organizing cadres to study Chairman Mao's instructions.

    中共福建省委召开地、市委书记会议
    研究解决全省人民内部存在的矛盾
    本报福州24日电　中共福建省委最近召开了地、市委书记会议。会议在传达了毛主席在最高国务会议上关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的讲话和毛主席在全国宣传工作会议上的讲话后，进行了热烈的讨论。
    与会者一致拥护毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的指示。大家认为以往工作中的某些错误和缺点，是由于未能正确划清敌我矛盾与内部矛盾的界限，专政和民主的界限而造成的。但福建地处海防前线，面对金门、台湾，还有残余的反革命，不应忽视敌我矛盾，不能放松对敌人的警惕。
    会议对当前本省人民内部矛盾作了初步分析。要求各级党委应坚决贯彻以粮食为主、全面发展生产的方针，在目前应大力领导农民搞好春耕生产，争取今年粮食大丰收。在农业生产计划方面，坚决实行在国家计划指导下给农业社机动权的原则，以利农业社因地制宜地安排生产，从而保证全面发展生产方针的实现。会议要求各级党委全面加强经济工作的领导，改善产销情况，协调工商关系，解决农村副业生产和城镇手工业生产之间的矛盾。与此同时，要正确执行收购农产品的价格政策，在收购中贯彻群众路线，纠正压级压价现象。
    会议要求大力加强思想工作，各级党委第一书记要亲自抓思想工作。在干部中要继续进行整风、整党、整社，以克服主观主义、官僚主义和宗派主义，树立实事求是、走群众路线的作风。对人民群众要进行社会主义、集体主义、民主集中制的教育。通过加强政治思想工作来充分发扬民主作风，提高群众政治觉悟，从而加强人民内部的团结，改善党群关系与干群关系。
    会议要求各部门在学习毛主席指示的基础上，全面系统地分析各该方面的内部矛盾，提出解决方案。
    会议检查了本省贯彻执行“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针的情况。会议认为虽然在高等学校初步展开了学术讨论，各剧种都演出了不少传统剧目，报纸刊物上开始出现了争鸣文章。但就总的情况来看，“放”的仍然很不够。会议要求各级党委教育干部，认识这一方针的重要意义，端正思想，消除顾虑，坚决贯彻执行这一方针，以求科学和文学艺术的发展繁荣。
    会议最后对如何做好传达和组织干部学习毛主席的指示作了研究布置。
