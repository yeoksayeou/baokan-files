Strengthened Ideological and Political Education for Students
Beijing Petroleum Institute Reverses Lax Discipline

(Our Dispatch) In the past three months, students at the Beijing Petroleum Institute have initially reversed the situation of lax discipline and indifference to politics, actively demanding to study politics and transform their thinking. Many are determined to strive to be excellent members of the Communist Youth League.

Construction Began with Great Difficulties; Students Cleared Weeds and Built Roads to "Create the World"

The Beijing Petroleum Institute was established in 1953. Initially, there were many difficulties. In September of that year, when the school was preparing to open, the campus was almost a barren wasteland. Only a quarter of an 8,000-square-meter dormitory building had been completed, and the completed rooms were still damp and the walls unpainted. Twelve hundred students, as well as faculty and staff, were crowded inside. Meals were eaten in tents erected on the wasteland. Classrooms were some simple, temporary houses, built about a kilometer away from the dormitories. However, the students did not complain. They used their voluntary labor to clear weeds, level roads, plant trees, and build a playground, and they enthusiastically held ribbon-cutting ceremonies for the completed playground and roads, naming them "Labor Glorious Square," "May First Road," and so on. They all felt honored to be able to "create the world" for the school with their own hands.

President and Teachers Shared Hardships, United to Overcome Difficulties

Why were the students so happy in such difficult conditions of learning and living? This was because the ideological education work done by the school leadership was relatively meticulous. Before the start of school, the difficulties facing the school were explained clearly to the students, first allowing them to observe the campus and explaining in detail the unavoidable reasons for not being able to start construction earlier and for the current difficulties. After the Party Committee put forward the call to "strengthen unity and overcome difficulties," the school's leaders shared hardships with the students. No one lived in a room alone; everyone crowded together and ate in the same place. On the first day of class, it was raining heavily and the weather turned cold. The windows of the temporary classrooms had not yet been installed. The vice president (there was no president at the time) and the dean of studies walked through the muddy roads and the rain to observe whether the students had any difficulties in class. The students were deeply moved.

In this way, the difficulties were overcome. In the summer of the following year, the school's major projects were completed one after another, and learning and living conditions were greatly improved.

Overemphasis on Developing Individuality; Signs of Lax Discipline Began to Emerge

In the first half of 1956, the school criticized some shortcomings in its past work, such as requiring students to develop in an average way and excessive collectivism, neglecting the development of students' personal interests, hobbies, and specialties; and lacking a democratic style in student collective life. After this, the trend of independent thinking and free debate rose among students. However, on the other hand, some biases also arose among some students, such as overemphasizing the development of individuality while neglecting the collective; demanding personal freedom excessively while neglecting discipline; one-sidedly emphasizing independent thinking and being unwilling to learn humbly from teachers; emphasizing the development of expertise and belittling general necessary courses; and opposing democracy to leadership. At this time, ideological and political education should have been strengthened for the students, but the work of the Party, administration, and Youth League in the school shrank back and failed to guide some of the incorrect ideas of the students onto the right path. In this way, the atmosphere of neglecting politics and lax discipline began to emerge among the students. In the second half of 1956, due to the excessive increase in new students, the learning and living conditions were far from meeting the actual needs, coupled with some impact from the counter-revolutionary riots in Hungary, the school's ideology was temporarily very chaotic.

Excessive Increase in New Students; Difficulties Reoccurred; Relaxing Ideological Education; School Order Disrupted

After the summer vacation in 1956, the school added 1,865 students, equivalent to 80% of the original students. The school's equipment, dormitories, classrooms, and teachers were all very inadequate. The dining hall, which could only accommodate 2,000 people for meetings, now had to accommodate 4,000 to 5,000 people for meals, and a two-shift meal system had to be implemented. Those who went to eat later had cold rice and cold dishes, and students complained and made noise; classrooms were insufficient, so the system was changed to two shifts in the morning and afternoon, and the original plans were disrupted; dormitories were insufficient, and faculty, staff, and students crowded together, and teachers and students had many opinions; students also had no place to study on their own.

Although the situation at this time was not as difficult as it was when the school was first established in 1953, because ideological and political education for students had been relaxed for a long time last year, especially after criticizing past excessive collectivism and other shortcomings, the new incorrect understandings in the students' minds were not corrected in time, and the school's order began to be disrupted. Some students slept when they wanted to sleep and played when they wanted to play, playing musical instruments and making noise late at night, and no one dared to manage them. To hold a class meeting, it could only be held if everyone in the class agreed to hold it. If someone asked to adjourn the meeting before it was over, everyone would disperse in a hubbub; the number of people participating in physical exercise also dropped from 90% to 10% at one time. At this time, although the school's Party Committee also put forward the slogan "Overcome Difficulties," it did not explain the truth of the difficulties to the students clearly, and as a result, the slogan could not be implemented, and the students said: The difficulties are caused by bureaucracy.

At this time, the mood of the fourth-year students in the Geology Department was very unstable. In the process of stabilizing the mood of these students, the school's Party, Youth League organizations, and administrative leaders understood that ideological education work not only could not be relaxed, but also had to be carried out in conjunction with various practical work and the students' specific ideological situation, and could not remain at relatively simple and general methods.

The fourth-year students in the Geology Department had been transferred from the Beijing Geological Institute after the summer vacation in 1956. At the beginning of the transfer, their thinking had some fluctuations. The school Party organization knew about this situation, but did not pay serious attention to it. In addition, the learning and living conditions were not good after the transfer, and they had many opinions. They had also raised opinions, but the leaders only studied them and did not tell the students the results of the research, so that the students believed that the leaders were bureaucratic and their emotions became more agitated.

After the school leaders learned of the students' very unstable mood, they promptly conducted research and then held a meeting with more than 30 student representatives to start solving the problem. The president, the dean of studies, the department head, and the heads of the Party Committee and the Youth League all attended the meeting, and tried to allow the student representatives to express their opinions as much as possible. Afterwards, the relevant persons in charge of various aspects of the school answered and explained separately, and made necessary self-criticisms. After such careful and serious handling, the problem was solved very smoothly, and the students also expressed satisfaction.

After this, the school's Party and Youth League organizations, according to the students' specific ideological situation, conducted education on communist morality and character, opposed not cherishing public property, and opposed emphasizing personal freedom hindering the collective. The president gave a report to all students. Because the behavior of a small number of students had already aroused the dissatisfaction of the vast majority of students who were willing to study hard, this made this ideological education work have a mass foundation. At the same time, the school administration also solved some of the living difficulties that could be solved, such as installing more electric lights in the dormitories. Soon, the newly built dining hall was also completed, and the problem of the dining location was solved. The school's order had a better change.

The Key to Reversing the Bad Atmosphere: Convening a Party Representative Congress, Examining Bureaucracy in Leadership, and Deciding to Strengthen Ideological and Political Education; The Whole School Studied "Once Again on the Historical Experience of the Proletarian Dictatorship," Clarifying Erroneous Ideological Understandings.

But the real reversal was after the school's Party Representative Congress was held last December, especially after the whole school studied "Once Again on the Historical Experience of the Proletarian Dictatorship" at the beginning of this year.

At the Party Representative Congress, bureaucracy in leadership was examined, and it was decided to strengthen ideological and political education for students. The president, the secretary of the Party Committee, and the cadres of the Party Committee and the Youth League also improved the style of contacting the masses and going deep into the masses, paying attention to grasping ideological work. The president and the secretary of the Party Committee also often participated in class meetings to solve the ideological problems of students in a timely manner. After the winter vacation this year, the school suspended classes for a week to specifically study "Once Again on the Historical Experience of the Proletarian Dictatorship," and the Party Committee grasped this study very tightly. In the study, the students, combined with their past ideological understanding, after debate and discussion, more clearly recognized the difference between contradictions among the people and contradictions between ourselves and the enemy; recognized the relationship between democracy and centralization; and also clarified the erroneous views on some domestic and international issues.

The Work of the Youth League Followed Up; Education on the Revolutionary Outlook on Life Played a Role

On this basis, the school also convened a Youth League Representative Congress and a Student Representative Congress. At the Student Representative Congress, the responsible comrades of the school gave a report, explaining the situation of the school, and put forward the requirements of hard struggle and running the school diligently and thriftily to the students. Then, the Youth League Committee arranged to educate students on the revolutionary outlook on life and strive to be an excellent member of the Communist Youth League in the Youth League classes, and focused on the relationship between politics and profession, in light of the thoughts exposed by the students. All the Youth League branches and groups conducted discussions. In the discussion, some Youth League members said: "The class stand was lost for a year or two, and now it has been picked up again." Some people said: "In the past, I didn't look like a Youth League member at all." The students began to actively demand progress.

In March, education on carrying forward the glorious tradition of the revolution began again. The president and several old cadres in the school gave reports to the students, and successively invited comrades from the People's Liberation Army who had participated in the Long March to give reports to the school. These reports deeply moved the students, and the school atmosphere changed greatly. In the second half of last year, when the Party Committee called on overcoming difficulties and mentioned the difficult conditions of the past revolutionary struggle, many students raised objections, believing that it was one thing then and another now, and now it is socialism. Today, students voluntarily put forward hard struggle and carrying forward the fine tradition of the revolution.

Now, the atmosphere of political study in the whole school is very strong, the estrangement between Party and Youth League cadres and students has been eliminated; the feelings between teachers and students, and between students, are harmonious; students consciously abide by discipline, and if individuals have bad behavior, they will be criticized by everyone at that time. Students have also begun to care about international issues.

The changes in the thinking of the students of Beijing Petroleum Institute in the past six months profoundly illustrate the importance of ideological and political education work in schools. Last year, ideological work was relaxed, coupled with some objective reasons, and as a result, the order of the whole school was disrupted, almost causing serious consequences; this year, ideological education work was grasped tightly, the students are still the original students, and the teachers are still the original teachers, and although the learning and living conditions have been improved, the change is not great, but the school has shown a new atmosphere.

### 加强了对学生的思想政治教育  北京石油学院扭转自由散漫风气

    加强了对学生的思想政治教育
    北京石油学院扭转自由散漫风气
    本报讯　最近三个月来，北京石油学院学生初步扭转了自由散漫、不问政治的状况，积极要求学习政治，改造思想，很多人决心争取作一个优秀的共青团员。
  建校之初困难重重学生拔草修路“创天下”
    北京石油学院是1953年建校的。最初，困难很多。当年9月间，学校准备开学了，院址几乎还是一片荒地。一幢八千平方公尺的宿舍楼刚刚完成四分之一，而且已经完工的房子还很潮湿，墙也没有粉刷。一千二百个学生，还有教职员工，都挤住在里面。吃饭是在荒地上搭起的席棚里。教室是临时盖起的一些简陋平房，而且离宿舍有一公里远。但是，学生们没有怨言，他们用自己的义务劳动拔草，平路，植树，修操场，还兴致很浓地为修好的操场和道路剪彩命名，如“劳动光荣广场”、“五一路”等等。他们都以能够亲手给学校“创天下”感到光荣。院长师生同甘共苦团结一致克服困难
    学生们在这种困难的条件下学习和生活，为什么精神又这样愉快呢？这是因为学校领导方面的思想教育工作做得比较细致。开学前，就把学校面临的困难向学生讲得清清楚楚，先让学生们观察了院址，详细说明了不能及早动工建校以及造成目前困难的一些不可避免的原因。在党委提出了“加强团结，克服困难”的号召以后，学校的领导人员和学生同甘共苦，没有一个人单独住一间房子的，大家都挤住在一起，都在一个地方吃饭。上课的第一天，正赶上下大雨，天气转凉，临时教室的窗户还没有安好，副院长（当时还没有院长）、教务长都踏着泥泞的道路，淌着雨水，到教室里来观察学生上课有没有困难。学生们很受感动。
    就这样，困难被战胜了。第二年夏天，学校的各项主要工程相继完工，学习和生活条件大大改善了。过分强调发展个性自由散漫开始露头
    1956年上半年，学校批判了过去工作中的一些缺点，如要求学生平均发展和过分集体化，忽视学生的个人兴趣、爱好和特长的发展；在学生集体生活中缺乏民主作风等等。这以后，在学生当中，独立思考和自由争论之风上升。但是另一方面，在部分学生中也产生了一些偏向，如过分强调发展个性而忽视集体；过分要求个人自由，忽视纪律；片面地强调独立思考，不愿虚心向教师学习；强调发展专长，轻视一般必要的课程，以及把民主和领导对立起来等等。这时候，本来应当对学生加强思想政治教育的，但是学校的党、行政、团的工作反而缩手缩脚，没有能够把学生中某些不正确思想引到正路上来。这样，学生中忽视政治、自由散漫的风气开始露头。而1956年下半年，由于增加新生过多，学习条件和生活条件远远赶不上实际需要，再加上匈牙利反革命暴乱的一些影响，学校里的思想一时很紊乱。
  新生增加过多　困难再度发生放松思想教育工作学校秩序紊乱
    1956年暑假后，学校里增加学生一千八百六十五人，相当于原有学生的80％，学校的设备、宿舍、教室、教师都非常不足。原来只能容两千人开会的饭厅，现在却要容四、五千人吃饭，不得不实行两班轮流吃饭的办法，后去吃的人，饭凉菜凉，学生吵闹不满；教室不够，改为上下午二部制，原订计划都打乱了；宿舍不够，教职员工和学生都挤住在一起，教师、学生意见都很多；学生也没有自习的地方。
    虽然这时的情况并不像1953年刚建校时那样困难，但是由于去年长时期放松了对学生的思想政治教育，特别是在批判过去过分集体化等缺点以后，学生思想中新产生的一些错误认识没有及时得到纠正，学校秩序就开始紊乱起来。有的学生想睡就睡，想玩就玩，深夜里玩乐器、唱闹，谁也不敢管。要开班会，只有全班每一个人都同意开才开得成，会没开完，有人要求散会，就一哄而散；参加体育锻炼的人也一度由90％降到10％。这时候学校党委虽然也提出了“克服困难”的口号，却没有把造成困难的真象向学生讲清楚，结果口号贯彻不下去，学生们说：困难是官僚主义造成的。
    这时候，地质系四年级学生的情绪表现得很不稳定。在稳定这批学生的情绪的过程中，学校党、团组织和行政领导方面懂得了思想教育工作不仅不能放松，而且还必须结合各种实际工作和学生们的具体思想情况来进行，不能停留在比较简单的和一般化的方法上。
    地质系四年级学生原是1956年暑假后从北京地质学院转来的，转校之初，他们的思想就有一些波动。这种情况学校党组织是知道的，但是没有认真注意，再加上转校后学习和生活条件不好，他们意见很多。他们也提过意见；但领导上只是作了研究，没有把研究结果告诉学生，以致学生们认为领导上官僚主义，情绪更加激动。
    学校领导方面知道学生情绪很不稳定的情况以后，及时地作了研究，紧接着同学生代表三十多人在一起开会，着手解决。院长、教务长、系主任以及党委、团委的负责人都参加了会，在会上尽量叫学生代表发表意见，以后分别由学校各方面有关负责人答复、解释，并且作了必要的检讨。经过这样慎重、认真的处理，问题很顺利地得到了解决，学生们也表示满意。
    这以后，学校的党、团组织根据学生的具体思想情况，进行共产主义道德品质的教育，反对不爱护公共财物，反对强调个人自由妨害集体等行为。院长给全体学生做了报告。因为少数学生这种行为已经引起了绝大多数愿意好好学习的学生不满，这就使这次思想教育工作有了群众基础。同时学校行政方面也解决了可能解决的一些生活上的困难，如在宿舍多安了电灯等。不久，新建的饭厅也落成了，吃饭地点问题得到了解决。学校的秩序有了较好的转变。扭转坏风气的关键召开党代表大会，检查领导上的官僚主义，决定加强思想政治教育工作；全校学习“再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”，澄清错误的思想认识。
    但是真正的扭转则是在去年12月召开了学校党代表大会以后，特别是今年年初全校学习了“再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”以后。
    在党代表大会上，检查了领导上的官僚主义，并且决定加强对学生的思想政治教育工作。院长、党委书记，以及党委、团委干部又改进了联系群众、深入群众的作风，注意抓思想工作。院长和党委书记还经常参加班会，及时解决学生中的思想问题。今年寒假后开学，学校停课一周，专门学习了“再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”，党委对这次学习抓得很紧。在学习中，学生们结合自己过去的思想认识，经过争辩讨论，比较清楚地认识到人民内部矛盾和敌我矛盾的区别；认识到民主和集中的关系；同时还澄清了对国内、国际上一些问题的错误看法。青年团的工作跟上来了革命人生观教育起了作用
    在这个基础上，学校又召开了团代表大会和学生代表大会。在学代会上学校的负责同志做了报告，解释了学校的情况，并向学生提出了艰苦奋斗，勤俭办校的要求。接着团委又布置在团课上对学生进行革命人生观教育和争取作一个优秀的共青团员的教育，并且针对学生暴露出来的思想，着重讲了政治和业务的关系。各团支部、小组都进行了讨论。在讨论中，有的团员说：“阶级立场丢掉了一两年，现在又拾了起来。”有的人说：“过去简直不像个青年团员的样子了。”学生们开始积极要求进步。
    3月间又开始进行发扬革命光荣传统的教育，院长和学校里的几个老干部分别给同学们作了报告，并且陆续请曾经参加过长征的解放军同志到校作报告。这些报告深深打动了同学们的心，学校空气大变。去年下半年党委号召克服困难，提到过去革命斗争艰苦情况的时候，许多学生提出反对意见，认为彼一时，此一时，现在是社会主义。而今天学生们自动地提出了艰苦奋斗、发扬革命优良传统。
    现在全学校里政治学习的空气很浓厚，党、团干部和学生之间的隔阂消除了；师生之间、同学之间的感情融洽了；学生们自觉地遵守纪律，个别人如有不好行为，当时就会受到大家的指责。学生对国际问题也开始关心起来。
    半年来北京石油学院学生思想的变化，深刻地说明了学校思想政治教育工作的重要性。去年放松了思想工作，再加上一些客观原因，结果全校秩序紊乱，几乎造成严重后果；今年抓紧了思想教育工作，学生仍然是原来的学生，教师也是原来的教师，学习和生活条件虽有所改善，但改变并不大，但是学校却出现了新的气象。
