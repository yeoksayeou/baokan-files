Treat the Symptoms, Heal Yourself
Yi Tiao

The article "If There Are Problems and Contradictions, How to Solve Them?" provides a general introduction to the discussion on "Hard Struggle, Building the Country Through Thrift and Diligence" in the Gansu Daily. This discussion involved many issues and genuinely resolved many problems. It was a successful discussion and a vivid lecture on political and ideological work.

The discussion in the Gansu Daily proves that the content of political and ideological work is complex and rich, and if done well, it can also be lively and vibrant. It is not as some people imagine, mistaking political and ideological work for a dry recitation of principles and abstract talk of grand ideas. There is a Chinese saying, "Treat the symptoms," and political and ideological work must also be like this. Suppose the actual problems in thought are the "symptoms," and general principles and doctrines are the "medicine." If applied appropriately, the medicine will surely cure the illness. Because only based on our principles and doctrines can we correctly analyze the problems in thought; and only by closely linking to the reality of thought can principles and doctrines play their due role. The discussion in the Gansu Daily set a good example in this regard.

To make public the important events happening in real life, and the various views of the masses on these events, and let the masses discuss and debate among themselves, to distinguish what is correct from what is wrong, what is positive from what is negative. The Gansu Daily did this very well. In the past, some people were afraid to make these important opinions public. In fact, since the matter is important, many people are concerned about it, and there are indeed various different views, not allowing it to be made public will still allow it to spread on its own. If a laissez-faire attitude is adopted after it is made public, neither affirming nor denying, it is naturally not good. If, like the Gansu Daily, the masses are organized to discuss, then the correct opinions will naturally persuade and overcome the wrong opinions, enabling more people to improve their understanding, distinguish right from wrong, and generate immunity to wrong ideas. Doing this regularly will make the masses healthier and stronger in ideological struggle.

The Gansu Daily's use of discussion is also a very good educational method for organizing the masses to educate themselves. Because the masses participate in the discussion themselves, it is possible to come into contact with the thoughts of the masses from all sides more deeply and concretely, so that people holding positive and negative opinions can express their views and debate. In this way, not only does the truth become clearer through debate, but also because many people have personally participated in the discussion, they will naturally have an extremely deep impression. Even those who do not directly participate in the discussion will be more interested in such debates than in listening to general reports or reading general articles. Therefore, for all issues involving the concerns of the broad masses, in addition to giving reports to the masses and writing various articles for publicity and education, more methods of organizing the masses to educate themselves can be adopted.

    对症下药，自己医自己

    “有问题，有矛盾，如何解决”？一文，概括地介绍了甘肃日报“艰苦朴素、勤俭建国”的讨论情况。这场讨论涉及到很多问题，并且真正的解决了很多问题。这是一次成功的讨论会，这是一次生动的政治思想工作的讲座。
    甘肃日报的讨论证明：政治思想工作的内容是复杂的、丰富的，如果作得好，也会是生动的、活泼的。并不如某些人所想像的那样，把政治思想工作误解为枯燥地谈原则和抽象地讲大道理。中国有一句话，叫做“对症下药”，政治思想工作也必须是这样。假定以思想中的实际问题为“症”，一般的原则、道理为“药”，运用得当，必然会药到病除。因为，只有根据我们的原则、道理，才会正确地分析思想中的问题；也只有密切地联系思想实际，才会使原则、道理发挥它应有的作用。甘肃日报的讨论在这方面作了一个好榜样。
    把现实生活中发生的重要事情，把群众对这些事情的各种各样的看法公开出来，让群众自己讨论、争辩，从中分清那是正确的，那是错误的；那是积极的，那是消极的。甘肃日报这一点作得很对。过去，有好些人怕把这些重要的意见公开出来。其实，事情既然重要，关心的人既然很多，事实上又确实有各种不同的看法，不让它公开，它仍然会自行蔓延。公开以后，如果采取自由主义的态度，不置可否，自然不好。如果像甘肃日报那样，组织群众讨论，那么正确的意见自然会说服和战胜错误的意见，会使更多人提高认识，分清是非，对错误思想产生免疫的力量。经常这样做，就会使群众在思想斗争中锻炼得更加健康更加坚强。
    甘肃日报采用组织讨论的方法，也是组织群众自己教育自己的一种很好的教育方法。因为群众自己参加讨论，就有可能更深刻、更具体的接触到各个方面的群众的思想，使持正面意见和反面意见的人各抒己见交锋辩论。这样，不但是非越辩越明，而且因为很多人亲自参加了讨论，自然会得到极为深刻的印象，就是不直接参加讨论的人，对这样的辩驳讨论也会比听一般的报告看一般的文章更感兴趣一些。因此，凡是涉及到广大群众关心的问题，除了向群众做报告、写各种各样的文章进行宣传教育以外，可以多采取组织群众自己教育自己这种办法。
