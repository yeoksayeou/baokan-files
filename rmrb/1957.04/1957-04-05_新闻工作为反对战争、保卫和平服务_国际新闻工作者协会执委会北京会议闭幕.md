Xinhua News Agency, April 4th – The Beijing meeting of the Executive Committee of the International Organization of Journalists (IOJ) concluded on the afternoon of April 4th.

The meeting unanimously adopted a resolution on international cooperation among journalists and issued a communiqué.

IOJ President Jean Maurice Hermann delivered the closing address. He congratulated the meeting on its success. He said that journalists should use the tool of news reporting to serve the cause of opposing war and defending peace; promote mutual understanding among people and international cooperation by reporting just and truthful news; and ensure that people can know more and accurate facts. Hermann also called on all journalists to oppose the testing and use of atomic weapons through news tools such as newspapers, radio, and television.

Finally, on behalf of the IOJ, Hermann presented gifts to the All-China Journalists Association. Deng Tuo accepted the gifts and expressed gratitude on behalf of Chinese journalists, wishing the IOJ’s work a prosperous and ever-developing future.

Many countries participating in the meeting hoped that the Executive Committee would send a letter to UNESCO. This letter requested UNESCO to grant the IOJ consultative status and condemned its repeated delays in discussing this issue. This letter was adopted at the closing meeting. Before the vote on this letter, Deng Tuo, head of the Chinese delegation, stated: Because the United Nations has deprived the People's Republic of China of its legitimate seat in the United Nations, the People's Republic of China has no relationship with the United Nations and its specialized agencies. Therefore, our delegation decided to abstain from voting on this letter. The delegations of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam also abstained in the vote.

Xinhua News Agency, April 4th – The Beijing meeting of the Executive Committee of the International Organization of Journalists issued the following communiqué:

The Executive Committee of the International Organization of Journalists held an enlarged meeting in Beijing on April 3rd and 4th of this year. The Executive Committee heard a report by IOJ President Jean Maurice Hermann on the possibility of cooperation between the IOJ and the United Nations and UNESCO, and a report by Secretary-General Knuchel on the IOJ's future work plan.

The reports were discussed at the meeting. Representatives of journalists' associations from the German Democratic Republic, Bulgaria, Romania, Mongolia, Mexico, Poland, Hungary, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Vietnam participated in the discussion. Mr. Gouda, former chairman of the Egyptian Journalists Association, also participated in the discussion as a guest.

The Executive Committee pointed out that the IOJ has always supported the principles declared by the United Nations in the past and will continue to do so in the future. Although the IOJ has not yet regained its rightful voice in UNESCO and the United Nations, it still intends to cooperate with these organizations on issues related to newspapers and journalists in the future.

The Executive Committee noted with satisfaction that the resolutions adopted at the International Journalists' Meeting in Helsinki on strengthening and expanding cooperation among journalists from all countries have been widely and well received. The Secretary-General's report and the speeches by representatives of various countries indicated that the exchange of delegations and the travel of individual journalists to other countries have recently greatly expanded. The Executive Committee particularly noted with satisfaction the strengthened friendly cooperation on matters between member organizations of the IOJ.

The Executive Committee stated that the IOJ is prepared to support the efforts of journalists in any country or group of countries to hold journalists' meetings and conferences on a professional basis. The Executive Committee called on member organizations to strive to support the efforts of the International Committee for Cooperation among Journalists to expand and strengthen international cooperation.

The Executive Committee instructed the Secretariat to implement the recommendations made at this meeting and requested member organizations to cooperate more actively with the Secretariat in implementing these recommendations.

The Executive Committee recommended that the Secretariat prepare for the timing and location of the IOJ Congress.

The Romanian Journalists Association's representative expressed the hope that the next meeting of the Executive Committee would be held in Romania, which was noted with satisfaction.
