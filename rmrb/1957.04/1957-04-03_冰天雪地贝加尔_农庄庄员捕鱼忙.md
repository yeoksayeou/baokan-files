Icy Baikal, Collective Farm Members Busy Fishing

Even though spring has arrived in southern Soviet Union, Lake Baikal is still frozen. Snowstorms still rage on the lake surface. Early in the morning, fishermen chop open the ice, cast their nets, and in the severe cold, pull the nets under the ice all day long with long poles, until the nets have traveled a considerable distance to another ice hole. In this photo, the fishermen are exploring the edge of the net. This is the most important moment, the net is about to be pulled up, and the harvest will soon be known.

They are fishermen from Posolskoye, an old village located on the steep bank of Lake Baikal, and members of the "Baikal" Collective Farm. The residents of this village have made a living by fishing for generations, working diligently on Lake Baikal regardless of winter or summer. In the era of Soviet power, the villagers formed a collective farm and named it after their beloved lake - "Baikal". Now, it is one of the largest fishing collective farms in the Buryat-Mongol Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic. Last year, the "Baikal" Collective Farm sold more than 3,000 quintals of fish to the state, of which 2,500 quintals were salmon.

Fishing on Lake Baikal is not easy! Although Lake Baikal is very beautiful on calm days, these days are not many, and the lake water is often turbulent. But danger does not scare the people of the "Baikal" Collective Farm. They go out fishing in any weather.

The members of the "Baikal" Collective Farm live prosperous lives. Each member's monthly income is above 1,000 rubles. Every family has electric lights and a radio. There is also a club in the village. The farm's fishing equipment is also improving year by year. Now the farm already owns a fishing fleet composed of motorboats. (Jun) (with picture)

    冰天雪地贝加尔　农庄庄员捕鱼忙
    现在，春天虽已来到苏联南部，可是贝加尔湖还被冰封着。风雪仍然在湖面上肆虐。清早，渔夫们凿开冰，撒下网，在严寒中，整天用长竿子拉着冰下的鱼网，直到使鱼网经过相当的距离到达另外一个冰窟窿为止。在这张照片上，渔夫们正探索到了鱼网的边。这是最重要的时刻，网马上就要拉上来了，收获如何，马上就可以知道了。
    他们是位于贝加尔湖陡岸上的一个古老村庄波索里斯克的渔民，是“贝加尔”集体农庄的庄员。这个村里的居民世世代代都以捕鱼为业，不分冬夏在贝加尔湖上辛勤劳动。在苏维埃政权年代，村里的居民成立了集体农庄，就拿他们所喜爱的湖——“贝加尔”作为农庄的名字。现在，它已是布利亚特—蒙古苏维埃社会主义自治共和国最大的捕鱼农庄之一了。去年，“贝加尔”农庄卖给国家三千多公担鱼，其中有二千五百公担是鲑鱼。
    在贝加尔湖上捕鱼是不容易的！虽然贝加尔湖在风平浪静的日子非常美丽，但是这种日子并不多，湖水常常是波涛汹涌的。可是危险吓不倒“贝加尔”农庄的人们。他们不管任何天气都照样出去捕鱼。
    “贝加尔”农庄的庄员们生活是富裕的。每一个庄员每月的收入都在一千卢布以上。家家都有电灯和无线电收音机。村里也有俱乐部。农庄的捕鱼工具也一年年改善着。现在农庄已拥有一支汽艇组成的渔船队。　（君）（附图片）
