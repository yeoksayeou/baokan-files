Chairman Mao's Speech Receives Enthusiastic Response in Factories and Mines
Beijing's Engineering and Technical Personnel Believe That Ideological Remoulding Should Be Strengthened to Overcome the Tendency of Neglecting Politics / The Yumen Oil Mine Party Committee Decides to Persist in Using Persuasion to Resolve the Contradiction Between Correct Thinking and Backward Thinking

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 13th – Several thousand Party members and non-Party cadres from thirty-eight state-owned factories and mines in Beijing have listened to the transmission of Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, and have universally studied and discussed it.

In the discussions, everyone expressed their unanimous support for the spirit of Chairman Mao's speech, believing that listening to the transmission was like grasping a key to solving problems, opening their eyes. Everyone also further discussed and analyzed some specific current contradictions.

Engineering and technical personnel discussed the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy and the ideological remoulding of intellectuals with great interest, repeatedly debating and further improving their understanding of the "Letting go" policy. In the discussions, many engineering and technical personnel mentioned the necessity of strengthening political study and carrying out self-ideological remoulding; believing that the tendency of neglecting politics that has grown among some engineering and technical personnel should be overcome. Zhao Xue-zheng, director of the repair plant of the Municipal Automobile Transportation Company, said: "In the past, I thought that problems could be solved by studying professional skills, but now I understand that without politics, there is no soul."

In the past, some people saw or heard some shortcomings in the work of agricultural production cooperatives, or problems with the work style of individual cooperative cadres, and had some doubts about the superiority of cooperation. Now they realize that it has only been a year since the upsurge of agricultural cooperation, and it is not a realistic attitude to demand that everything be good. The problem of individual cadres' bad work style cannot be confused with the superiority of the cooperative.

Everyone also discussed specific issues such as wage policies, birth control, and the entrance of middle and primary school students into higher schools.

The discussions basically achieved free expression of opinions. On some issues where opinions differed, debates were launched. Through the debates, many people's understanding was improved.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Yumen, April 13th – The Yumen Oil Mine Committee of the Communist Party of China, at a recent enlarged meeting, conveyed and discussed Chairman Mao Zedong's speech at the Supreme State Conference on the correct handling of contradictions among the people. The meeting believed that the contradiction between the correct thinking of the workers and the various erroneous thoughts and unhealthy tendencies is also one of the internal contradictions of the people in the enterprise. To solve these contradictions, we must adhere to the method of persuasion and education, and convince people with reason, and we cannot adopt a simple and crude attitude. To this end, the meeting decided that in the future, we should further strengthen the political and ideological education of the workers and masses in all aspects. Starting from now, we must first launch a mass self-education movement from top to bottom and from bottom to top among all party members. In the future, we must mobilize all party members to do ideological work. At the same time, all departments and organizations at all levels of the Party, administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League should regard regular investigation and research work as the primary task, and also strengthen the theoretical and political study of workers, and regularly carry out criticism and self-criticism, and conduct ideological mutual assistance, so that they can always maintain and carry forward the fine tradition of hard work and simplicity of the working class. The meeting also decided to transfer forty-five leading cadres at the section chief level and above to go deep into the grass-roots units such as factories and companies to take on work for a certain period of time, to help grass-roots cadres do a good job in the political and ideological education and the work of increasing production and practicing economy for the workers.

    毛主席的讲话在厂矿中得到热烈反响
    北京市的工程技术人员认为应当加强思想改造克服忽视政治的倾向玉门油矿党委决定坚持用说服方法解决正确思想同落后思想的矛盾
    本报讯　北京市已有三十八个国营厂矿企业全体党员和非党干部数千人，听了毛主席在最高国务会议上作的关于正确地处理人民内部矛盾问题的讲话的传达，并普遍地进行了学习和讨论。
    讨论中，大家表示一致拥护毛主席讲话的精神，认为听了传达好像掌握了一把解决问题的钥匙，使自己打开了眼界。大家还进一步对当前的一些具体矛盾进行了讨论分析。
    工程技术人员们极有兴味地对“百花齐放、百家争鸣”方针以及对知识分子进行思想改造的问题，作了反复的争辩，进一步提高了对“放”的方针的认识。在讨论中，许多工程技术人员都提到加强政治学习，进行自我思想改造的必要；认为在部分工程技术人员中滋长起来的忽视政治的倾向是应该克服的。市汽车运输公司修理厂厂长赵学正说：“过去认为只要钻研业务就能解决问题，这回才明白，没有政治就没有灵魂。”
    过去有人看到或听到农业生产合作社工作中的一些缺点，或个别社干部作风上的毛病，就对合作化的优越性发生了一些怀疑。现在认识到农业合作化高潮到来才一年，要求样样好，不是实事求是的态度，个别干部作风不好的问题，不能与合作社的优越性混淆在一起。
    大家还对工资政策、节制生育和中、小学生升学等具体问题进行了讨论。
    讨论基本作到了畅所欲言，在一些大家意见不一致的问题上，展开了辩论，通过争论，许多人的认识有了提高。
    据新华社玉门13日电　中共玉门油矿委员会在最近举行的一次扩大会议上，传达并讨论了毛泽东主席在最高国务会议上关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的讲话。会议认为，职工群众中的正确思想同各种错误思想和不良倾向之间的矛盾，也是企业里人民内部矛盾之一。解决这些矛盾，必须坚持说服教育、以理服人的方法，不能采取简单粗暴的态度。为此，会议决定今后要从各个方面来进一步加强职工群众的政治思想教育。从目前起，首先在全体党员中展开一个由上而下和由下而上相结合的群众性的自我教育运动。今后要动员全体党员人人动手来做思想工作。同时，党、行政、工会、青年团的各部门和各级组织，都应该把经常的调查研究工作列为首要的任务，还要加强职工的理论和政治学习，经常地开展批评和自我批评，进行思想互助，使他们经常保持和发扬工人阶级艰苦朴素的优良传统。会议还决定，要抽调四十五名科长级以上的领导干部深入各厂、公司等基层单位，担任一定时期的工作，帮助基层干部做好职工的政治思想教育和增产节约工作。
