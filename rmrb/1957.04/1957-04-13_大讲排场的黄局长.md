    The Extravagant Director Huang
    During the preparatory period for establishing the Hubei Provincial Geological Bureau, Director Huang Tao approved a procurement plan that exceeded the control number given by the higher authorities by 65%. Near the end of last year, the bureau's acting office director organized people to rush to the market to purchase materials, spending 48,000 yuan in a short period. Originally, the Central South Geological Bureau transferred a batch of furniture to them, but now they have rushed to purchase another batch. Thus, according to the bureau's current number of employees, each person has an average of more than three desks, more than seven chairs and stools, and more than three single and double beds. In the director's dormitory, there are more than 30 pieces of furniture such as tank-style leather sofas and rattan sofas, worth more than 1,000 yuan. A small leather briefcase was purchased for each section chief and bureau director. Some time ago, the provincial party committee notified all agencies to practice strict economy, but they still bought a car after receiving the notice. Their paper supplies and equipment are also excessive; the envelopes alone would last for nine years.
    When the employees expressed dissatisfaction with this serious extravagance and waste, Director Huang and some other leaders of the bureau complained that the masses were "making the bureau a mess," saying that it was "still insufficient" compared to other agencies. Even when the Ministry of Geology sent people to inspect, a deputy director said: "We must make a self-criticism, but we still need to sit on the sofas." During the inspection, Director Huang also admitted that this behavior was wrong, but he also said: "I come from a poor peasant background and have never made the mistake of extravagance and waste in history." As for what this erroneous thinking is and why they still acted this way during the Increase Production and Practice Economy movement, he has not found out. I think Director Huang should dig deeper.

    大讲排场的黄局长
    湖北省地质局局长黄涛若在筹备建立省地质局期间，由他批准的采购计划，比上级机关所给控制数大65％。去年接近年终的时候，这个局的代理办公室主任组织力量到市场抢购物资，在短期内，就花掉了四万八千元。原来中南地质局移交给他们一批家具，现在，他们又抢购了一批。这样，按着这个局的现有人数计算，每人平均有三张多桌子、七把多椅子和凳子、三张多单人床和双人床。在局长的宿舍里，配备有坦克式的皮沙发、藤沙发等家具三十多件，价值千元以上。给每一个处长和局长都买了手提小皮包一个。前些时候，省委通知各个机关要厉行节约，但是他们在接到通知以后，仍买了一部小汽车。他们的纸张设备也多得不得了，光信封就可用九年。
    当职工群众对这种严重的铺张浪费现象表示不满的时候，黄局长和局的其他一些负责人还埋怨群众“把局里搞得乌烟瘴气”；说什么比别个机关“还有不足”。直到地质部派人进行检查的时候，还有一个副局长这样说：“检讨是要检讨，沙发还是要坐”。在检查时，黄局长也承认这种行为是错误的，但是，他又说：“我是贫农出身，历史上从未犯过铺张浪费的错误”。至于这种错误思想是什么？为什么在增产节约运动中还这样干？却没有找出来，我认为黄局长还应该挖挖根子。
