Ancient Greek Painted Pottery Cup Discovered in Northern Italy

    This newspaper reports that not long ago, in the ancient Etruscan city of Spina, near Lake Comacchio in northern Italy, a painted Greek "kylix" pottery wine cup dating from between 465 and 460 BC was discovered. The largest of these cups has a mouth diameter of 55 centimeters. This type of ancient artifact is similar to the ancient Chinese "dou," but has small, slightly upward-curving handles on both sides.

    According to preliminary identification, this wine cup may have been created by the same master artist as the "Penthilea Cup" in the collection of the Munich Pinakothek. The paintings inside and outside the cup depict scenes from Homer's "Odyssey" and other ancient Greek myths, and are magnificent and vivid. It was mainly used for large banquets.

    古希腊彩陶杯
    在北意大利发现
    本报讯　不久以前，在意大利北部康马捷阿湖附近古代依土里亚人居住过的斯宾那城发现公元前465—460年之间的古希腊“克烈克斯”彩绘陶酒杯。其中最大的一个杯口直径五十五公分。这种古文物类似我国古代的“豆”，但两旁有稍向上弯的小把手。
    据初步鉴定，这只酒杯可能与慕尼黑宾那科席克美术陈列馆所收藏的“宾夕施利亚杯”出自同一艺术名家之手。杯的里外的画面是以荷马史诗“奥得赛”和别的古希腊神话为题材，华丽而生动。主要用于大宴会上。
