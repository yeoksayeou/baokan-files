Xinhua News Agency, Washington, April 21st: The U.S. State Department issued a statement on April 20th, forced to express its agreement to make certain relaxations to the trade "embargo" against China.

The State Department's statement said that the United States has been unwilling and remains unwilling to agree to any relaxation of trade controls on China, but,
"In order to satisfy the wishes of its allies while continuing to maintain effective multilateral controls, the United States has notified the fourteen countries that participate with it in multilateral controls that the United States is prepared to discuss certain modifications to the existing system."

The statement said that, according to the recommendations made by the United States to the aforementioned fourteen countries, certain items for peaceful use that are currently prohibited from being shipped to China will be decontrolled and will be placed on the same basis as trade with the Soviet Union.

However, the statement emphasized that certain other items currently prohibited from being exported to China will continue to be embargoed and will be transferred to the embargo list for the Soviet Union, but with a lesser degree of control. At the same time, the United States also recommends that the currently used "exception" procedure be made more stringent.

The statement concluded that the United States will continue to unilaterally prohibit all trade with China.

    美被迫同意放宽对华“禁运”
    但美国仍单方面禁止对中国的一切贸易
    据新华社21日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院4月20日发表声明，被迫表示同意把对中国的贸易“禁运”作某些放宽。
    国务院的声明说，美国一直不愿意并且现在仍然不愿意同意把对中国的贸易管制作任何放松，但是，
  “为了满足盟国的希望而同时又继续维持有效的多方面管制，美国已经通知和它一起参与多方面管制的十四个国家，美国准备讨论在现行制度中实行某些修改的问题。”
    声明说，根据美国向上述十四国提出的建议，现在禁止运往中国的某些和平用途的项目将解除管制，并且将置于同苏联贸易的同样基础上。
    但是声明强调，某些现在禁止输往中国的其他项目将继续禁运，并将转入对苏联的禁运清单中，但是加以较小程度的管制。同时，美国还建议现在使用的“例外”程序要更加严格。
    声明最后说，美国将继续单方面禁止对中国的一切贸易。
