Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 12th: Japanese officials and public opinion are unanimously expressing the hope that the United States can relax the "embargo" restrictions imposed on Japan, to realize President Eisenhower's promise to consider giving Japan more freedom to trade with China.

The Japanese government and business circles hope that Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi will not return to Japan empty-handed after negotiating with the U.S. government on the issue of expanding trade between Japan and China during his visit to the United States this year. It is revealed that the Japanese government has begun actively preparing for the negotiations that Kishi will conduct with the U.S. authorities on this issue. Sources say that Kishi will request the United States to convene a meeting of the relevant institutions of the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM) as soon as possible to consider relaxing the "embargo" on China.

According to well-informed government sources, the Japanese government, which in the past held a somewhat negative attitude towards Sino-Japanese relations, will also "fully support and assist" private trade groups that advocate expanding Sino-Japanese trade. These trade groups are currently actively preparing to conclude the fourth trade agreement with China to replace the third trade agreement, which will expire in May.

Many Japanese newspapers published commentaries today and yesterday on Eisenhower's remarks, pointing out that it is disadvantageous for Japan to impose an "embargo" on its neighbor, China. The "Mainichi Shimbun" said that the Japanese government and the Japanese people should redouble their efforts to strive for more trade with China.

The "Yomiuri Shimbun" demanded that the Japanese government quickly resolve the issue of "fingerprinting" Chinese trade delegations upon entry. The newspaper pointed out that the major issues in trade with China are the mutual dispatch of trade delegations and the conversion of the current barter system to a payment settlement system.

    日本各界要求美国放宽“禁运”限制
    据新华社12日讯　东京消息：日本官方和公众舆论一致表示希望美国能够放宽强加于日本的“禁运”限制，以实现美国总统艾森豪威尔关于考虑给予日本以同中国进行贸易的更多自由的诺言。
    日本政府和经济界人士希望日本首相岸信介今年访问美国时同美国政府就日本同中国扩大贸易问题进行谈判以后，将不至于空手回到日本。据透露，日本政府已经开始为岸信介将同美国当局就这个问题进行的谈判积极进行准备工作。有消息说，岸信介将要求美国早日召开巴黎统筹委员会的有关机构的会议，考虑放宽对中国的“禁运”。
    据消息灵通的政府人士透露，过去对日中两国关系抱着一定消极态度的日本政府，还将“充分支持和帮助”主张扩大日中贸易的民间贸易团体，这些贸易团体目前正在积极准备同中国缔结第四次贸易协定，来代替将于5月期满的第三次贸易协定。
    日本的许多家报纸在今天和昨天纷纷就艾森豪威尔的谈话发表评论，指出日本现在对它的邻国——中国实行“禁运”是不利的。“每日新闻”说，日本政府和日本人民应该加倍努力，争取同中国进行更多的贸易。
    “读卖新闻”要求日本政府迅速解决关于中国贸易代表团入境时“按指纹”的问题。这家报纸指出，同中国贸易的重大问题是互派贸易代表团和把目前的易货制改为支付结算制。
