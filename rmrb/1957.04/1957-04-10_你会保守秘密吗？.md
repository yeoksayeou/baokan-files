    Can You Keep a Secret?
    A young man with a strong sense of curiosity always wanted to find out from Sophia Perovskaya (note) what the revolutionaries were talking about in the meetings. He often pestered Perovskaya with this question, but she always turned the conversation to other topics. The young man couldn't hold back any longer: "Dear Sophia, please tell me!"
    Perovskaya seemed somewhat hesitant and asked softly, "Can you keep a secret?"
    "Yes!" the young man happily agreed.
    "So can I!" Perovskaya replied in the same tone, and walked out of the room laughing.
                (Translated by Chen Mingkun)
    Note: Sophia Perovskaya was a famous Russian female revolutionary who was later sentenced to death by the Tsarist government.

    你会保守秘密吗？
    有一个好奇心很强的青年一直想从索菲亚·比罗夫斯卡娅（注）那里打听打听革命党人在会议上讲些什么。他经常拿这个问题跟比罗夫斯卡娅纠缠不已，而后者却总是把谈话转到别的话题上去。这青年实在忍不住了：“亲爱的索菲亚，请求你讲一讲吧！”
    比罗夫斯卡娅作出了似乎有些动摇的样子，轻轻地问道：“你会保守秘密吗？”
    “会！”青年人高兴地答应说。
    “我也会！”比罗夫斯卡娅用同样的音调回答了他，笑哈哈地走出了房间。
                （陈明锟译）
    注：索菲亚·比罗夫斯卡娅，是俄国的有名的女革命家，后被沙皇政府判处死刑。
