Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, 24th dispatch from TASS: A mass meeting was held in Bangkok to protest Thailand's participation in military exercises organized by the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and to protest the British nuclear weapons tests on Christmas Island.

The mass meeting was initiated by various parties participating in the Socialist United Front.

Nai Thep Chotinuchit, leader of the Economist Party and member of parliament, severely criticized at the mass meeting the United States for enticing Thailand to join the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and for using Thailand as a tool to achieve its goals in the Southeast Asian region. Nai Thep said that the United States' so-called "anti-communism" policy is an excuse to force other countries' governments to accept its will. He said that if the United States does not change its policy towards Thailand, then the Thai people will have to suggest that "American guests leave Thailand."

Many other members of parliament and leaders of the various parties participating in the Socialist United Front also spoke at the mass meeting. They demanded that Thailand withdraw from the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and demanded that major powers be prohibited from continuing to test atomic weapons.

The slogans and banners of the mass meeting were: "We Thai people love peace and hate war. The Thai people hope to pursue a neutral policy and withdraw from the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty Organization group," "Patriots, unite to fight for peace, independence, and democracy!"

Xinhua News Agency, 25th dispatch from Singapore: The naval and air exercises in the Gulf of Siam, involving six member countries of the Manila Treaty Organization, began yesterday.

Nineteen warships from Britain, France, the United States, and Australia sailed from Singapore yesterday, including the Australian aircraft carrier "Melbourne."

These warships are heading north towards the Gulf of Siam, where warships from New Zealand and Thailand will join them at sea.
