    Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in Various Parts of Jilin Province
    Vigorously Adjust Draft Animals to Support Spring Plowing in Other Provinces
    Xinyang Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Henan Province Adjusts Draft Animals Based on Surplus and Shortage

    (By Our Staff Reporter) Supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Jilin Province are actively carrying out the adjustment of draft animals between provinces and within the province, and have already made significant achievements. According to statistics from the supply and marketing cooperatives of An'guang, Da'lai, Baicheng, Fuyu, Dehui and other twelve counties alone, by the end of March, more than 9,360 head of high-quality draft animals (of which large draft animals accounted for 92.4%) had been transferred to agricultural cooperatives in Hebei, Liaoning, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi and other provinces. Most of them have been transported back to agricultural cooperatives in various provinces and put into agricultural production. It is estimated that more than 7,400 head of large draft animals can still be transferred out before spring plowing and sowing. At the same time, supply and marketing cooperatives in Dongliao, Shuangyang, Huadian and other counties are also actively organizing local agricultural cooperatives to purchase more than 3,160 head of draft animals from the distribution markets of An'guang, Da'lai, Dehui and Fanjiatun.

    (By Our Staff Reporter) Since February, supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Xinyang Special District, Henan Province, have organized more than 1,000 cadres to go deep into various townships and agricultural cooperatives to carry out planning work for surplus and shortage of draft animals. As of the end of March, 3,140 agricultural cooperatives in the entire special district had carried out planning work for surplus and shortage of draft animals. According to statistics from Xin County, Xinyang and other six counties, a surplus of 23,191 head of cattle has been planned; Runan, Xiping and other eight counties have planned a shortage of 134,987 head of cattle. Based on this situation, local supply and marketing cooperatives actively mobilized surplus livestock cooperatives to sell draft animals, and at the same time mobilized shortage livestock cooperatives to prepare funds to purchase draft animals. In just ten days, Xinyang, Guangshan and other seven counties signed cattle sales agreements with many agricultural cooperatives, selling a total of 20,591 head of cattle, accounting for 92% of the surplus cattle; the counties in Huaibei with a shortage of cattle, through in-depth exploration of financial potential in agricultural cooperatives, have planned funds of more than 200,700 yuan, and sent special personnel to the production areas to purchase draft cattle; the government has also allocated 1 million yuan in draft cattle loans to help shortage cattle areas that are unable to purchase draft cattle. As of the end of March, according to statistics from Runan, Pingyu, Zhengyang, Xincai and other nine counties alone, 6,472 head of draft animals have been adjusted and put into production.
