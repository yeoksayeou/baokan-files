Xinhua News Agency, 9th: Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Poland, Cyrankiewicz, and his wife held a grand reception at the Beijing Hotel tonight for the Polish government delegation's visit to China.

Chairman Mao Zedong, Vice Chairman Zhu De, and Premier Zhou Enlai attended the reception.

Chairman Mao Zedong said at the meeting:

　　Comrades, friends:

　　We thank Comrade Cyrankiewicz, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Poland, and the Polish government delegation he leads for bringing the fraternal friendship of the Polish people to the Chinese people. We ask the Polish government delegation to take back to the Polish people the same friendship and best wishes of the Chinese people.

　　We wish the People's Republic of Poland even better success in building socialism.

　　We wish the Soviet Union, Poland, China, and other socialist countries to be more consolidated in unity.

　　We wish the countries of the socialist camp, together with other peace-loving countries and peoples in the world, to work even harder for the cause of world peace and human progress.

　　I ask you all to join me in a toast,

　　To the health of Comrade Cyrankiewicz, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of Poland, and his wife, and to the health of other Comrades in the Polish government delegation,

　　To the health of Comrade Gomulka, First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party,

　　To health of Comrade Zawadzki, Chairman of the Polish Council of State!

Chairman Cyrankiewicz said at the beginning of the banquet:

　　Dear Comrade Mao Zedong, Comrade Zhu De, Comrade Zhou Enlai, dear guests:

　　I am extremely happy to be able to receive Chinese friends headed by Comrade Mao Zedong in Beijing today.

　　I think this is a very good omen, and in the near future, we will be able to welcome our most esteemed friend, the great leader of the Chinese people, in Warsaw.

　　As representatives of Poland, we are deeply moved by the sincere friendship we have received in the People's Republic of China.

　　If we tell the Polish people that we have such good friends as the great Chinese people, then the Polish people will be very happy.

　　In the past, under colonial rule, our people were isolated and helpless, and we could only rely on our own strength. For this reason, our people have suffered a great deal, and our people, like the Chinese people, fought for freedom. After we liberated ourselves from Hitler's occupation and embarked on the road of socialism, we found sincere friendship in other socialist countries. The Soviet Union, the main participant in defeating Hitler, gave us strong help. We also found friends in Europe who, like ourselves, were building socialism. When the People's Republic of China was founded, we found great friends among the Chinese people. Now our people no longer feel alone. We are a member of the big family of socialist countries. As a member of the big family of socialist countries, we are greatly encouraged in building socialism. We are very happy that we can build a bridge of friendship spanning thousands of kilometers between Poland and China. All of this helps us build a new life and develop the strength of our people. We also hope to coexist peacefully with all those who want peace and everyone who wants peaceful coexistence. The Polish people have full sympathy for all people who are fighting for freedom.

　　We are very happy to have this opportunity to meet the admirable and great friends of New China.

　　We have unforgettable impressions of New China, and we will convey these impressions to the Polish people.

　　We are convinced that our visit to China will contribute to the further strengthening of the friendship between the Polish and Chinese peoples, and will be another factor in strengthening the unity of our entire socialist camp.

　　Please allow me to propose a toast to our beloved Chinese guests, Comrade Mao Zedong, Comrade Zhu De, Comrade Zhou Enlai, to other leaders of the great Chinese people, to the great Chinese people, to the friendship between Poland and China, to the unity of the socialist camp, and to world peace.

　　At the end of the speeches by Chairman Cyrankiewicz and Chairman Mao Zedong, the band played the national anthems of the People's Republic of China and the People's Republic of Poland respectively.

　　The reception proceeded in a warm atmosphere. Finally, Chairman Cyrankiewicz and all the Polish comrades present sang "May You Live a Hundred Years" to express their respect and gratitude to Comrade Mao Zedong, Comrade Zhu De, Comrade Zhou Enlai, and other friends. The reception ended with this famous Polish folk song.

　　Those present at the reception included Vice Premiers of the State Council Chen Yun, He Long, and Nie Rongzhen; Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Li Jishen, Guo Moruo, Huang Yanpei, Peng Zhen, and Chen Shutong; Vice Chairmen of the National Defense Committee Zhang Zhizhong, Fu Zuoyi, and Long Yun; Vice Chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Zhang Bojun and Bao Erhan; Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu and Ji Pengfei; Chinese Ambassador to Poland Wang Bingnan; heads of various departments of Chinese state leading organs, democratic parties, and people's organizations; people from all walks of life in Beijing; and diplomatic envoys and economic representatives from various countries in China, totaling more than 600 people.

    新华社9日讯　波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹和夫人，为波兰政府代表团访问中国，今晚在北京饭店举行盛大的招待会。
    毛泽东主席、朱德副主席和周恩来总理出席了这个招待会。
    毛泽东主席在会上讲话说：
    同志们、朋友们：
    我们感谢波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹同志和他所率领的波兰政府代表团为中国人民带来了波兰人民兄弟般的友谊。我们请波兰政府代表团把中国人民同样的友谊和最良好的祝愿带回给波兰人民。
    祝波兰人民共和国更好地建设社会主义。
    祝苏联、波兰、中国和其他社会主义国家更加巩固地团结在一起。
    祝社会主义阵营各国同世界上其他爱好和平的国家和人民一起，更好地为世界和平和人类进步的事业努力。
    我请大家同我一起，
    为波兰部长会议主席西伦凯维兹同志和他的夫人，为波兰政府代表团其他同志们的健康，
    为波兰统一工人党第一书记哥穆尔卡同志的健康，
    为波兰国务委员会主席萨瓦茨基同志的健康，
    干杯！
    西伦凯维兹主席在宴会开始时讲话说：
    亲爱的毛泽东同志、朱德同志、周恩来同志，亲爱的来宾们：
    我今天能够在北京接待以毛泽东同志为首的中国朋友们，感到无限的高兴。
    我想这是一个很好的预兆，不久的将来我 们就能够在华沙欢迎我们的最尊贵的朋友、中国人民的伟大领袖了。
    作为波兰的代表，我们为我们在中华人民共和国所受到的诚恳的友谊深深感动。
    如果我们告诉波兰人民，我们有伟大的中国人民这样的好朋友，那么波兰人民一定会非常高兴的。
    过去，在殖民统治之下，我们的人民是孤立无援的，我们只能依靠我们自己的力量。就因为这个原因，我们的人民曾经遭受很大的痛苦，我们的人民像中国人民一样为自由而斗争。当我们从希特勒的占领下把自己解放出来走向社会主义的道路以后，我们从其他的社会主义国家里找到了真诚的友谊。战胜希特勒的主要参加者——苏联给了我们有力的帮助。我们也在欧洲的就像我们自己一样在建设社会主义的国家中找到了朋友。当中华人民共和国成立以后，我们在中国人民当中找到了伟大的朋友。现在我们的人民不再感到孤单了。我们是社会主义国家大家庭中的一员。作为社会主义国家大家庭中的一员，我们在建设社会主义中得到很大的鼓舞。我们为我们能够同中华人民共和国之间建立起一座跨越几千公里的友谊的桥梁，而感到非常高兴。所有这些都有助于我们建设新的生活和发展我们人民的力量。我们也希望和所有愿意和平和每一个愿意和平共处的人进行和平共处。波兰人民对一切为自由而斗争的人民都具有充分同情。
    我们十分高兴有这个机会认识了可钦佩的伟大的新中国朋友。
    我们对新中国有着难忘的印象，我们将把这些印象转达给波兰人民。
    我们深信，我们来中国的访问，将对波兰和中国人民之间的友谊的进一步加强作出贡献，并将是我们整个社会主义阵营加强团结的另一个因素。
    请允许我为我们敬爱的中国来宾，毛泽东同志、朱德同志、周恩来同志，为伟大的中国人民的其他领导人，为伟大的中国人民，为波兰和中国的友谊，为社会主义阵营的团结一致，为世界和平而干杯。
    在西伦凯维兹主席和毛泽东主席先后讲话结束时，乐队分别奏中华人民共和国国歌和波兰人民共和国国歌。
    招待会进行得很热烈。最后，西伦凯维兹主席和在场的所有波兰同志合唱了“长命百岁”，向毛泽东同志、朱德同志、周恩来同志和其他朋友们表示敬意和感谢。招待会就在这首著名的波兰民歌声中结束。
    出席招待会的，有国务院副总理陈云、贺龙、聂荣臻，全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长李济深、郭沫若、黄炎培、彭真、陈叔通，国防委员会副主席张治中、傅作义、龙云，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席章伯钧、包尔汉，外交部副部长章汉夫、姬鹏飞，中国驻波兰大使王炳南，中国国家领导机关各部门、各民主党派、各人民团体负责人，北京各界人士，以及各国驻华使节和经济代表等共六百多人。
