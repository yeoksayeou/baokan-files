Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 21st: Moscow newspapers today published the notes that Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko delivered on April 19th to the diplomatic envoys of Britain, France, and the United States to the Soviet Union.

    In these notes, the Soviet government requested that the four countries—the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France—should condemn the use of force as a means of resolving outstanding issues in the Near and Middle East, as this seriously violates the principles of the United Nations Charter. This must be done as a first step towards improving and normalizing the situation in the region.

    The Soviet government's notes were in response to the replies of the United States, Britain, and France on March 11th to the Soviet Union's proposal of February 11th regarding the basic principles of the four-power declaration on peace and security in the Near and Middle East. In their replies, the Western countries stated that they were not prepared to accept the Soviet government's draft declaration.

    In its note to the United States, the Soviet government pointed out that the U.S. government's refusal to accept these principles and its failure to offer any constructive suggestions amounted to a rejection of the search for an acceptable basis for resolving the disputes in the region.

    The Soviet government pointed out that the fundamental obstacle currently hindering a peaceful resolution of the disputes and conflicts in the Near and Middle East is foreign interference in the affairs of the countries in the region, which undermines the sovereignty and independence of the countries of the Near and Middle East.

    The note stated: "The Eisenhower Doctrine" stipulates direct U.S. intervention in the affairs of the countries of the Near and Middle East, up to the point of deploying U.S. troops to these countries. This U.S. policy cannot but further intensify the tension in the region.

    The Soviet government continues to believe that through the joint efforts of the major powers—the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France—lasting and consolidated peace in the Near and Middle East can be guaranteed on the basis of the principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of the countries of the Near and Middle East and respect for their national independence and sovereignty, as proposed in the draft declaration.

    In its note to Britain, the Soviet government pointed out that the recent intensification of U.S. activities in the Baghdad Pact, with the U.S. and Britain colluding in this regard, once again proves that the establishment of military blocs and foreign military bases in the Near and Middle East has nothing in common with the interests of maintaining peace.

    In its note to France, the Soviet government pointed out that Israel openly threatens to re-invade Egypt, regardless of the relevant United Nations resolutions, if its greed is not satisfied. In this regard, Israel does not conceal its hope for the support of certain groups in the Western countries. At the same time, one cannot ignore the Western press reports that French government officials have promised Israel economic and military assistance in its war against Egypt. The concentration of air forces on the island of Cyprus is obviously also related to these plans.

    The Soviet note also condemned the policy of certain Western countries of attempting to exert crude economic pressure on Egypt by restricting trade with Egypt, freezing Egyptian assets, and prohibiting their ships from passing through the Suez Canal.

    In these notes, the Soviet government stated that it is prepared to consider the opinions of the U.S., French, and British governments on the Soviet notes with due attention.

### 苏联要求美英法三国  共同谴责在中近东使用武力

    苏联要求美英法三国
    共同谴责在中近东使用武力
    据新华社莫斯科21日电　莫斯科报纸今天都登载了苏联外交部长葛罗米柯4月19日交给英国、法国和美国驻苏联外交使节的照会。
    苏联政府在这些照会中要求苏联、美国、英国和法国四国应当谴责把使用武力作为解决中近东未决问题的手段，因为这严重违反联合国宪章的原则。必须这样做，以作为使这个地区的局势健康化和正常化的第一步。
    苏联政府的照会是针对3月11日美国、英国、法国对苏联在2月11日提出的四大国关于中近东的和平和安全的宣言的基本原则这一问题的复照而发表的。西方国家在复照中表示，它们不准备接受苏联政府提出的宣言草案。
    苏联政府在给美国的照会中指出，美国政府拒绝接受这些原则，而且也不提出任何建设性的建议，这实质上是拒绝为解决这个地区的争执问题找寻可以接受的基础。
    苏联政府指出，目前，妨碍和平解决中近东争端和冲突的基本障碍，是外国对这个地区国家事务的干涉，这种干涉破坏了中近东国家的主权和独立。
    照会说：“艾森豪威尔主义”规定美国直接干涉中近东国家的事务，一直到派遣美国军队到这些国家。美国的这种政策不能不促使这个地区的紧张局势进一步加强。
    苏联政府仍旧认为，通过大国——苏联、美国、英国和法国——的共同努力可以在宣言草案所提出的规定不干涉中近东国家内政和尊重它们的民族独立和主权的原则的基础上，保证中近东的持久的和巩固的和平。
    苏联政府在致英国的照会指出，不久以前，美国加紧在巴格达条约中进行活动，美国和英国在这方面串通一气，这再一次证明，在中近东建立军事集团和外国军事基地的目的同维护和平的利益毫无共同之点。
    苏联政府在给法国的照会中指出，以色列公然威胁说，如果它的贪欲得不到满足，它就会不顾联合国的有关决定，重新侵略埃及。在这方面，以色列并不掩饰它指望西方国家某些集团的支持。同时，还不能忽视西方报纸这样的消息：法国政府官方人士已经答应以色列，在它同埃及作战的时候给予经济和军事援助。在塞浦路斯岛集结空军一事显然也同这些计划有关。
    苏联照会还谴责某些西方国家力图用限制同埃及贸易、冻结埃及资产、禁止本国船只通过苏伊士运河等等手段来实行对埃及施加粗暴经济压力的政策。
    苏联政府在这些照会中表示，它准备以应有的注意来考虑美国、法国和英国政府对苏联照会提出的意见。
