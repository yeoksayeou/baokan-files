    Contradictory Phenomena in Steel Supply of Northwest Engineering Management Bureau
    Stockpiling Large Amounts of Steel While Demanding More Steel
    Hoping the National Materials Allocation Bureau Will Transfer the Unused Steel Out and the Urgently Needed Steel In
    (Our Newspaper) At present, there exists a contradictory phenomenon in the Northwest Engineering Management Bureau regarding steel: on the one hand, a large amount of steel is stockpiled, while on the other hand, a large amount of steel is needed.

    On the one hand, a large amount of steel is stockpiled, while on the other hand, a large amount of steel is needed.
    According to the regulations of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, the steel reserve of the Northwest Engineering Management Bureau is 10,000 tons. However, statistics at the end of January showed that the bureau actually had 25,000 tons of steel, plus 3,000 tons that had already been made into various prefabricated components, finished and semi-finished products. This number shows that the bureau's current steel exceeds the reserve by 18,000 tons. This year, the bureau's total construction tasks require 30,000 tons of steel. If we consider the bureau's existing steel figures, the state only needs to allocate another 2,000 tons of steel to the bureau this year. However, the actual situation is not so. Of the bureau's existing 28,000 tons of steel, only 13,000 tons can be used for this year's projects, and 15,000 tons are unusable. If the state does not transfer out the stockpiled steel, a large amount of steel will not be utilized for one or two years, resulting in a long-term accumulation of capital of 7.5 million yuan, and it will also be impossible to obtain the steel needed this year, affecting this year's basic construction tasks. Or they may be forced to substitute and process existing steel, causing a great waste.

    Many Reasons: Frequent Plan Changes, Steel Allocation, Variety of Specifications All Have Problems.
    Why does the Northwest Engineering Management Bureau stockpile so much steel?

    First, due to frequent plan changes last year, the original plan was too large, and then greatly reduced. The original planned total construction volume of 260 million yuan was increased to 330 million yuan. Later, it was discovered that it was a rash advance, and the plan was reduced three times, and the annual plan was finally determined to be just over 120 million yuan in November. When applying for materials last year, it was based on the initial plan, so the material plan itself was too large. Subjectively, in order to rush the progress, they feared a shortage of materials rather than an excess, which also encouraged the demand for more materials. For example, there was a batch of large steel, which another unit did not want. For the Northwest Engineering Management Bureau, it was not needed at the time, but in order to control more materials, they thought that the task was large and they were not afraid of not being able to use it, so they also took it, resulting in stockpiling.

    Second, according to the application material system, the superior stipulated that the plan for the next year should be submitted before November 20th each year. However, at that time, the plan for the next year was not yet determined, and the construction drawings for the determined projects had not yet arrived. Therefore, they were not sure how much steel was needed for each project, and what varieties and specifications were required. Because the applied materials often differed from the actual needs, stockpiling was also caused.

    Third, design changes. For example, for two factory buildings, due to changes in the plan, the 500 tons of special steel originally prepared were all stockpiled.

    Fourth, the time of steel allocation did not match the construction progress, and it could not be supplied in complete sets. For example, the materials needed in the second quarter were not allocated in time, so other steel had to be used as substitutes. However, by the third quarter, the allocated steel was no longer needed.

    Fifth, the varieties and specifications of the producing factories do not meet the construction needs. The general situation is that there is too much large steel and insufficient wire (small steel below 10 mm). The demanding units reluctantly take the large ones, control the steel, and then try to find a way.

    How to Solve? There are Difficulties and Solutions.
    How to solve this problem?

    The first solution is for the construction units of the Northwest Engineering Management Bureau to make the most of the existing steel. However, the amount that can be utilized is limited. Since the fourth quarter of last year, they have sent 1,800 tons of large round steel to Shanghai, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang and Wuhan for processing into wire. However, for every ton processed, the steel material consumption rate reaches 10% (equivalent to 50 yuan), and only nine tons return for every ten tons sent; plus transportation and processing costs, the average waste is about 240 yuan per ton.

    Secondly, the state should allocate and adjust; the Ministry of Construction Engineering should allocate within the scope of its affiliated construction companies; or adjust mutually with the needed construction units on the spot. However, there are also some problems with the allocation scope and prices, which need to be negotiated and resolved by relevant units.

    Thirdly, steel production enterprises are required to overcome difficulties and increase the production of small steel. At the same time, the metallurgical departments can also directly hand over some small steel ingots to Shanghai, Tianjin and other places to be rolled into small steel.

    As long as all parties focus on the overall interests, the problem can be solved.

    Is the situation of the Northwest Engineering Management Bureau an isolated case? No, due to the adjustment of the construction progress this year, similar situations also occur in various construction units. There are some in Xi'an, some in Taiyuan, and others in other places. This situation has resulted in the stockpiling of a large amount of steel on the one hand, and the need for a large amount of steel on the other, while the steel stockpiled by some units is urgently needed by other units. It is hoped that the National Materials Allocation Bureau will allocate it, transfer out the unused steel, transfer in the urgently needed steel, or allow for necessary adjustments. Although making adjustments may cause all sorts of troubles, as long as each unit can focus on the interests of the country, focus on the development of industry, calculate the big picture, break down departmentalism, and at the same time solve specific problems such as price differences, these problems should and can be solved through unified state arrangements and the joint efforts of various ministries.

### 西北工程管理总局钢材供应中的矛盾现象  压着大量钢材又要大量钢材  希望国家物资分配局把不用的调出去把急需的调进来

    西北工程管理总局钢材供应中的矛盾现象
    压着大量钢材又要大量钢材
    希望国家物资分配局把不用的调出去把急需的调进来
    本报讯　目前西北工程管理总局在钢材方面存在着一个矛盾现象，一方面积存了大量钢材，同时又需要大批钢材。
    一方面积压了大量钢材，同时又需要大批钢材。
    按照建筑工程部的规定，西北工程管理总局的钢材储备量是一万吨。但到1月底的统计，全局实有钢材二万五千吨，还有三千吨已经制成各种预制构件的成品和半成品。这个数字，说明这个局现有钢材超过储备量一万八千吨。今年这个局的全部建筑任务，需用钢材三万吨。如果按照这个局现有的钢材数字来说，今年国家只要再拨两千吨钢材给这个局就够用了。但是，实际情况却又不然。这个局现有的两万八千吨钢材中，可以用到今年工程上的，只有一万三千吨，有一万五千吨是用不上的。如果不由国家把他们积压的钢材调拨出去，就会造成大量钢材在一两年内无法利用，长期积压资金七百五十万元，并且也将无从取得今年需用的钢材，影响今年的基本建设任务。或者被迫代用和加工利用现有钢材，造成很大的浪费。
    原因很多：计划多变、钢材调拨、品种规格都有问题。
    为什么在一个西北工程管理总局，就会积存这么多的钢材呢？
    第一、由于去年计划多变，原计划偏大，而后又大为缩减，由原定的建筑工程总量二亿六千万元，提高到三亿三千万元，以后发现冒进了，三次减少计划，到11月份才最后确定年计划一亿二千多万元。去年在申请材料的时候，是根据年初计划提出的，因之，材料计划本身就大了。而主观上为了抢进度，材料怕少不怕多，也助长了多要材料。比如有一批大型钢材，是另一个单位不要的，对于西北工程管理总局来说，也不是当时需用的，但是为了掌握更多的材料，认为好在任务大，不怕用不出去，也要来了，结果，积压下来。
    第二、申请材料的制度，上级规定要在每年11月20日以前提出下年度的计划，可是，在那个时候对于下年度的计划未定，定了的工程，施工图纸又未到来，因之对于每项工程究竟需要多少钢材，要那些品种和规格，心中无数。由于申请的材料同实际的需要常有出入，因而也造成了积压。
    第三、设计变更。比如有两个厂房，由于改变了计划，原来准备的五百吨特种的钢材就全部积压下来。
    第四、钢材调拨的时间不符施工进度，又不能成套的供应。比如第二季度需用的材料，没有及时拨来，就不得不用别的钢材代用。可是到第三季度，拨来的钢材已经用不上了。
    第五、生产厂的品种规格，不合建设需要，总的情况是大型钢材过多，线材（十公厘以下的小型钢材）不足。需用单位就勉强要下大的，掌握住钢材，再想办法。
    怎样解决？有困难有办法。
    怎样解决这个问题呢？
    首先的出路，是由西北工程管理总局各施工单位，尽量利用现有钢材。但是，能够利用的却是有限的。从去年第四季度以来，他们已把一千八百吨大型圆钢送到上海、天津、石家庄和武汉去加工，改成线材。可是，每加工一吨，钢料消耗率达10％（折价五十元），运去十吨，运回来只有九吨；加上运费、加工费平均每吨加工要浪费约二百四十元。
    其次，由国家调拨，进行调剂；由建筑工程部在所属建筑公司范围里调拨；或者就地同需要的施工单位互相调剂。但是，调拨范围和价格也有一些问题，需要有关单位协商解决。
    再次，要求生产钢铁的企业，克服困难，增加小型钢材的产量。同时，冶金部门也可直接将部分小型钢锭交上海天津等地轧成小型钢材。
    只要各方面从整体利益着眼，问题就能解决。
    西北工程管理总局的情况，是不是个别的呢？不是的，由于今年调整了建设的进度，类似的情况，同样发生在各个建筑单位，西安有，太原有，其他地方也会有。这种情况，造成了一方面积压了大批钢材，同时又需要大批钢材，而一些单位积压的钢材有的又为另一些单位所急需。希望国家物资分配局加以调配，把用不着的调出去，把急需的调进来，或允许进行必要的调整。虽则在提出调整的时候，会引起种种麻烦，但是，只要各个单位都能够从国家利益着眼，有利于工业建设着眼，算大账，打破本位主义，同时又能解决差价等具体问题，这些问题，经过国家统一的安排，各部共同的努力，是应当而且能够解决的。
