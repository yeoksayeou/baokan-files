    Branched Corn Seeds are Limited; Please Wait Until Autumn If Needed
    The publication in the People's Daily about our cooperative's branched corn has attracted a lot of attention. As a result, people from all over the country have written to us, requesting seeds for branched corn. However, our cooperative does not have many branched corn seeds to propagate. We currently only have one hundred and twenty catties of improved branched corn seeds, which our cooperative will use for this year's seeds. If various regions need them, please write to us again after the autumn harvest in 1957.
    Yang Chonggao, Director of Pingshang Central Agricultural Cooperative, Pingshang District, Puding County, Guizhou Province

    分枝玉米种子不多  如果需要请等秋后
    人民日报上发表了我社的分枝玉米一事，引起了不少人的注意。因此全国各地纷纷给我们来信，要分枝玉米的种子。但我社繁育的分枝玉米种子并不很多，目前只剩下一百二十斤分枝玉米良种，我们社里要作为今年的种子。如果各地需要的话，请他们在1957年秋收后再来信。
