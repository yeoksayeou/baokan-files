    The strengthening of the friendly unity between socialist countries is a heartening and significant development in the current international situation. Recently, government and party delegations from many socialist countries have engaged in frequent contact and a series of friendly talks, further consolidating and developing their friendly unity on a new basis. The recent friendly talks between the governments and parties of the Soviet Union and Albania have made significant efforts to further strengthen the friendly relations between the two countries and to strengthen the unity and cooperation between the socialist countries led by the Soviet Union. The joint declaration of the Soviet Union and Albania and the joint statement of the two parties fully reflect the results of this effort.

    For more than twelve years, the Soviet Union and Albania have forged unbreakable fraternal relations. Economic cooperation between the two countries has greatly developed, and the Soviet Union's great assistance to Albania has promoted the high tide of Albania's national economy. With the assistance of the Soviet Union, the Albanian people have built a number of important industrial enterprises, eliminating technical and economic backwardness to a considerable extent. During the talks, the government delegations of the two countries comprehensively discussed and studied the economic relations between the two countries, expressed satisfaction with the past economic cooperation between the two countries, and reached an agreement on how to further develop this relationship. The Soviet government decided to cancel two Albanian debts to the Soviet Union, totaling 422 million rubles. In addition, the Soviet government will also provide Albania with the necessary technical assistance for the development of agriculture and industry, and supply Albania with the equipment and machinery needed for industry and agriculture. This generous and selfless brotherly assistance from the Soviet Union fully embodies the great internationalist spirit of close unity and mutual support between socialist countries, and is of great significance to the victorious socialist construction of the Albanian working people.

    The friendly and cooperative relations between the Soviet Union and Albania are a model of the truly equal and mutually beneficial relations that exist between large and small countries in the world. The Soviet Union, with a population of 200 million, and Albania, with a population of only 1.4 million, are able to establish such completely equal relations because the relationship between socialist countries is a completely new type of relationship in human history, based on proletarian internationalism, based on Leninism on national equality and mutual respect. In the socialist family, regardless of whether it is a large or small country, regardless of its economic level, it is a completely equal member and a close cooperative brother. It is not surprising that imperialists do not understand or are unwilling to understand this relationship. Because between capitalist countries, there is only an unequal relationship of mutual annexation and the big fish eating the small fish. Turning to the history of capitalist development, it can be seen that advanced capitalist countries, in order to enslave the people of other countries, try to hinder the development of those countries. In the age of imperialism, "the law of the jungle" is the golden rule of monopoly capital, and it is also the inevitable law for imperialist powers to treat small countries. Even within the major imperialist country groups, the relationship between the leader and the partners reflects this characteristic.

    A recent series of facts shows that while the imperialists are fighting each other, they have not relaxed their attempts to undermine the unity of socialist countries for a moment. Therefore, in the joint declaration and the joint statement of the two parties, and in the speeches of the leaders of the two parties and governments, it was repeatedly emphasized that vigilance should be heightened and unity should be strengthened. This is absolutely necessary. Because the unity of socialist countries is where the fundamental interests of peace and socialism lie. We firmly believe that the unity of socialist countries with common goals and ideological foundations is becoming increasingly consolidated and unbreakable. No force in the world can undermine this unity, and the friendship between the Soviet Union and Albania is indestructible by any force.

    The Chinese people welcome the major achievements of the talks between the government delegations and party delegations of the Soviet Union and Albania, and are pleased with the further consolidation and development of the friendly relations between the socialist countries in the recent period. The socialist family headed by the Soviet Union is becoming more and more united and unbreakable, which is a powerful source of common prosperity for our socialist countries and a reliable guarantee for consolidating world peace.

    苏阿兄弟友谊的新发展
    社会主义国家之间的友好团结正在不断加强，这是目前国际形势中令人鼓舞和意义重大的发展。最近以来，许多社会主义国家的政府和党的代表团，曾经进行了频繁的接触和一系列的友好会谈，使它们之间的友好团结在新的基础上更加巩固和发展了。这次苏联同阿尔巴尼亚两国政府和党之间的友好会谈，对于进一步加强苏阿两国之间的友好关系，加强以苏联为首的社会主义国家之间的团结合作，又作了重大的努力。苏阿两国联合宣言和苏阿两党联合声明，充分体现了这一努力的成果。
    在过去十二年多以来，苏阿两国已经结成了牢不可破的兄弟关系。两国经济合作得到了很大发展，苏联给予阿尔巴尼亚的巨大援助，促进了阿尔巴尼亚国民经济的高涨。在苏联的援助之下，阿尔巴尼亚人民已建成了一些重要的工业企业，在相当大的程度上消灭了技术上和经济上的落后状态。在这次会谈中，两国政府代表团全面讨论和研究了两国的经济关系问题，对两国过去的经济合作感到满意，并对如何进一步发展这种关系取得了协议。苏联政府决定取消阿尔巴尼亚欠苏联的两项债务，总额共达四亿二千二百万卢布。此外，苏联政府还要给予阿尔巴尼亚以发展农业和工业的必要技术援助，供给阿尔巴尼亚以工农业所需的装备和机器。苏联这种慷慨无私的兄弟般的援助，充分体现了社会主义国家亲密团结、互相支援的伟大的国际主义精神，它对阿尔巴尼亚劳动人民胜利建设社会主义事业具有重大意义。
    苏阿两国的友好合作关系，是世界上大国和小国之间存在的真正平等互助关系的榜样。拥有两亿人口的苏联同只有一百四十万人口的阿尔巴尼亚，它们所以能够建立这种完全平等的关系，因为社会主义国家的相互关系，是人类历史上完全新型的关系，它建立在无产阶级国际主义的基础上，建立在列宁主义关于民族平等和互相尊重的基础上。在社会主义大家庭里，无论大国或小国、无论它的经济水平如何，都是完全平等的成员，都是亲密合作的兄弟。帝国主义者不理解或不愿意理解这种关系，是不足为怪的。因为在资本主义国家之间，存在的只是互相并吞、大鱼吃小鱼的不平等关系。翻开资本主义发展史就会看到，先进的资本主义国家为了奴役他国人民，力图阻碍那些国家的发展。在帝国主义时期，“弱肉强食”是垄断资本的金科玉律，也是帝国主义列强对待小国的必然法则。就是在主要帝国主义国家集团中，盟主与伙伴的关系也表现了这个特点。
    最近的一系列事实表明，帝国主义者在彼此勾心斗角的同时，一刻也没有放松他们破坏社会主义国家团结的企图。因此，在苏阿联合宣言和两党声明中，在两国党和政府领导人的讲话中，都一再强调要提高警惕，加强团结。这是完全必要的。因为社会主义国家的团结，是和平和社会主义事业根本利益的所在。我们坚信：具有共同的奋斗目标和思想基础的社会主义国家的团结，是日益巩固和牢不可破的。世界上没有任何力量可以破坏这种团结，苏阿两国的友谊是任何力量所不能摧毁的。
    中国人民欢迎苏阿两国政府代表团和两党代表团会谈的重大成就，为最近期间以来各社会主义国家间的友好关系的进一步巩固和发展而感到高兴。以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭越来越团结得坚不可摧了，这是我们社会主义国家共同繁荣的有力泉源，也是巩固世界和平的可靠保证。
