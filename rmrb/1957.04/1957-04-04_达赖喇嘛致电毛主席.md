Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 3rd: The Dalai Lama sent telegrams to Chairman Mao Zedong, Vice Chairman Zhu De, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and Premier Zhou Enlai on April 1st, reporting his safe return to Lhasa.

In his telegram to Chairman Mao, the Dalai Lama said: "Last year, I went to India to attend the 2,500th anniversary commemoration of the Nirvana of our teacher Sakyamuni, visited the Indian government and Buddhists, represented the country in Nalanda to present Xuanzang's skull relic and donations for the construction of a memorial hall to India, paid homage to famous holy sites, and visited major cities in India. Through this trip to India to attend the Buddhist conference, not only was the affectionate and friendly relationship between China and India strengthened, which is beneficial to world peace, but it also made everyone clearly see that the religious freedom policy of the Chinese Communist Party and your great leader has been and is being thoroughly implemented in China."

In the telegram, the Dalai Lama wished Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Zhu, Chairman Liu, and Premier Zhou good health, and expressed his hope that they would frequently give him guidance in his work.
