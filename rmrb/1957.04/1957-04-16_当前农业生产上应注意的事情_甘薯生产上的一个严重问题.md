    Matters Needing Attention in Current Agricultural Production
    A Serious Problem in Sweet Potato Production
    Currently, in China's major sweet potato producing areas, such as Shandong, Henan, Hebei, Jiangsu and other provinces, black rot disease has become a major threat to sweet potato production. With the long-distance transfer of seed potatoes and seedlings, the affected area is expanding year by year. This is a serious problem in sweet potato production.
    In 1956, the prevention, control and quarantine work for sweet potato black rot disease achieved remarkable results in some areas, with examples of large-scale successful control emerging. In Juehe District of Suining County, Jiangsu Province, the incidence rate reached 30% in 1955, and the loss of rotten sweet potatoes in the district exceeded 6 million catties. In 1956, after using methods such as seed selection, high cutting of seedlings, crop rotation, and the establishment of seed-retaining plots for disease prevention, the incidence rate was reduced to below 0.1%. By the end of December, an inspection of 320 sweet potato cellars in the district did not reveal a single diseased sweet potato. Similar situations existed in some areas of Shandong, Hebei and other provinces.
    These areas were able to eliminate the serious harm of black rot disease in a short period of time because they grasped the main key to eliminating black rot disease.
    One of the keys to eliminating black rot disease is: breeding disease-free seed potatoes. Black rot disease is mainly transmitted by seed potatoes, and can also be transmitted through soil and manure. Therefore, establishing disease-free seed-retaining plots is very important. Establishing disease-free seed-retaining plots requires crop rotation, planting disease-free seedlings, applying fertilizers that do not carry pathogens, and avoiding water contaminated with pathogens.
    Using warm beds (or heated brick beds) for seedling cultivation is also a key to cultivating disease-free sweet potato seedlings. Whether using the warm water seed soaking method or the secondary high cutting seedling method to cultivate disease-free sweet potato seedlings, it is necessary to use warm beds (or heated brick beds) for seedling cultivation. If the warm bed management is not good during the seedling cultivation period, seedling emergence may be slow, or even seed potatoes may rot. According to experience, attention should be paid to three points: when cultivating seedlings, strictly control the bed temperature, and arrange the potatoes after the bed temperature stabilizes, so as to avoid burning the seed potatoes due to excessive temperature; during the seedling cultivation period, the bed temperature should be maintained at 25 to 34 degrees Celsius to avoid rot caused by low temperatures; and pay attention to the hygiene of the seedbed environment.
    The method of cold bed seedling cultivation with one high cutting also has a positive disease prevention effect. In areas where warm bed seedling cultivation has not yet been adopted for cultivating summer sweet potatoes, this method can also be promoted.
    In newly developed sweet potato areas, it is very important to strictly implement quarantine to prevent the introduction of black rot disease. In order to prevent sweet potatoes from being infected with black rot disease, She County, Hebei Province, on the one hand, established seed-retaining plots and seedling nurseries to breed a large number of disease-free sweet potato seedlings, and organized agricultural cooperatives for seedling cultivation and agricultural cooperatives for seedling use to sign propagation contracts; on the other hand, it established mass quarantine organizations, locally elected quarantine personnel, and strictly controlled the inflow and planting of foreign seedlings. Their experience proves that only by correctly combining quarantine work with seedling breeding work can the most fundamental and proactive measures be taken.
    The sweet potato seedling cultivation season has arrived, and now is a favorable time to prevent and control black rot disease. Agricultural production leading departments in various regions should take charge of the prevention, control and quarantine of black rot disease, adopt various effective measures according to local conditions, vigorously publicize the importance of prevention, control and quarantine, impart prevention and control techniques, help agricultural cooperatives formulate prevention and control plans, rationally arrange labor, overcome the harm of black rot disease, and strive to harvest more sweet potatoes this year.

    当前农业生产上应注意的事情
    甘薯生产上的一个严重问题
    目前，在我国甘薯主要产区，如山东、河南、河北、江苏等省，黑斑病成为甘薯生产上的一个很大的威胁。黑斑病随着种薯和薯苗的调远，为害面积逐年在扩大。这是甘薯生产上的一个严重问题。
    1956年甘薯黑斑病的防治和检疫工作，在某些地区，已经做出了显著的成绩，出现了大面积防治成功的范例。江苏省雎宁县雎河区，1955年发病率达到30％，全区烂薯损失六百余万斤，1956年用选种、高剪苗、轮作及建立留种地等办法防治后，发病率压低到0.1％以下，12月底检查全区三百二十个薯窖，没有发现一个病薯。山东、河北等省的一些地区也有类似的情况。
    这些地区能在短时期内消灭黑斑病的严重为害，是因他们抓住了消灭黑斑病的主要关键。
    消灭黑斑病的关键之一是：繁殖无病种薯。黑斑病主要由种薯传染，也能经土壤和粪肥等传染，因此建立无病留种地是很重要的。建立无病留种地要求实行轮作，扦插无病苗，施不带病菌的肥料，浇的水也要避免污染病菌。
    用温床（或火炕）育苗，也是培育无病薯苗的一个关键。不论用温汤浸种法或二次高剪苗法培育无病薯苗，都需要采用温床（或火炕）育苗。在育苗期间，如温床管理不善，便可能出苗缓慢，甚至种薯腐烂。根据经验要注意三点：育苗时要严格控制床温，等床温稳定后再排薯，以免温度过高烧坏种薯；育苗期间床温要维持到摄氏二十五度至三十四度，避免低温引起腐烂；并注意苗床的环境卫生。
    冷床育苗一次高剪的办法也具有积极防病的作用，栽培夏薯目前还没有采用温床育苗的地区，也可以推广这个方法。
    在新发展甘薯的地区，严格执行检疫，防止黑斑病传入，是很重要的，河北省涉县为使甘薯不染上黑斑病，一面建立了留种地和采苗圃，大量繁育无病薯苗，组织育苗的农业社和用苗的农业社订立繁殖合同；一面建立群众性的检疫组织，就地推选检疫人员，严格控制外来种苗流入和栽植外来种苗。它们的经验证明：只有把检疫工作和种苗繁育工作正确地结合起来，才是最根本的、积极的措施。
    甘薯育苗的季节已经到了，目前正是防治黑斑病的有利时期。各地农业生产领导部门应该把黑斑病的防治和检疫工作抓起来，因地制宜地采取各种有效措施，大力宣传防治和实行检疫的重要意义，传授防治技术，帮助农业社订好防治计划，合理安排劳力，战胜黑斑病的为害，争取今年收获更多的甘薯。
