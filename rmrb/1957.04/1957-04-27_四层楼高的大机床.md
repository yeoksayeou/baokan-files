    Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 26th. The largest mechanical press in our country, created by the Moscow Likhachev Automobile Factory for the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, is being shipped from Moscow to Changchun.
    This large press, used to manufacture the main beams of automobiles, has a pressure of 3,500 tons and weighs more than 700 tons. It is as high as a four-story building. A cold-rolled steel plate of nine centimeters thick can be folded into a large beam of an automobile in just one minute. The parts of this large machine are transported in more than twenty carriages; the four tensioning screws that have already arrived occupy a carriage with a load capacity of fifty tons. Shipping this equipment once made Soviet comrades very difficult, because there were no carriages with a load capacity of more than 700 tons for land transport by train, and even if the machine was loaded on the train, it could not pass through the tunnel; if it was transported by ship from the sea, there were problems with the capacity of the ship's hold and the loading and unloading at the dock; if it was transported by plane from the air, there were more difficulties. Finally, they conducted a general survey of the railway tunnels and bridge conditions between Beijing and Moscow before deciding to specially manufacture a special train twice as large as a Chinese train carriage for land transportation. The Likhachev Automobile Factory also specially built a factory building to manufacture this large press.

    四层楼高的大机床
    据新华社长春26日电　莫斯科利哈乔夫汽车工厂为第一汽车制造厂创制的我国最大的机械压床，正由莫斯科陆续运到长春。
    这部制造汽车主梁用的大压床，压力达到三千五百吨，自身重量是七百多吨，有四层楼那么高。一块九个糎厚的冷轨钢板，只需一分钟就被折叠成汽车的大梁。这部大机器的零件，是分作二十多个车厢装运的；已经运到的四根拉紧螺丝，就占去了一个载重五十吨的车厢。起运这台设备，曾经使苏联同志很为难，因为从陆地用火车没有载重七百多吨的车厢，即使机器装上了火车，也过不了隧道；从海上用轮船运，船舱的容量和上下码头又有问题；从空中用飞机运输，困难更多。最后，他们把北京——莫斯科之间的铁路隧道和桥梁情况，作了一次普遍调查，才决定专门制造一列比中国火车厢大一倍的特别列车，从陆地运输。利哈乔夫汽车工厂为了制造这部大压床，还专门盖了厂房。
