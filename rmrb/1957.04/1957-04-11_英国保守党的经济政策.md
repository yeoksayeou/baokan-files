    British Conservative Party Economic Policy
    By Sam Aaronovitch, UK

    The Conservative government's military adventure over the Suez Canal illustrates how worried British imperialism is about its declining position in the world.

    The Decline of British Imperialism's International Position

    The international position of British imperialism has long undergone fundamental changes. Only a number of favorable characteristics after World War II temporarily obscured the overall decline of Britain's international position. These favorable characteristics were: the temporary destruction of Britain's competitors such as Germany and Japan, the enormous need for domestic and international reconstruction work, and a worldwide gold-dollar shortage that favored British goods exports.

    British monopoly capital took advantage of these favorable conditions to successfully achieve a huge expansion in exports. It expanded capital accumulation and built factories at home and abroad; it re-established a force that allowed half of the world's trade to be conducted in pounds sterling; it strengthened its exploitation of the colonies, whose sterling balances reached more than 1.3 billion; and it restricted the consumption and wage increases of the British people.

    Nevertheless, during the twelve years after the war, the fact that Britain's international position had changed became increasingly prominent.

    At a time when Britain was greatly weakened, British imperialism tried to rebuild its colonial position in the world, an effort that has made it dependent on American imperialism during this period. As the price of aid, American trusts have not only insisted on reaching agreements that restrict Britain's autonomy in internal and foreign affairs, but have also drastically increased their investment in and penetration of the British Empire and the British domestic market. In many industrial sectors in Britain, American investment already occupies a decisive force.

    Britain's connection with the United States has resulted in the latter trying to drive the former out of certain regions of the world, such as the Middle East. The recently released "Eisenhower Doctrine" is just the latest example of the United States taking advantage of British imperialism's difficulties.

    Part of the cost of Britain's imperialist policy is an annual military expenditure of 1.5 billion pounds; this figure is nearly 10% of the national income, averaging about 30 pounds per year for every Briton.

    Despite the increase in Britain's exports, its share of world trade continues to decline; the ratio was 26% in 1950, 21% in 1954, and 20% in 1955.

    Efforts to preserve British imperialism have also led to disastrous consequences in terms of the balance of payments. Britain's annual overseas military expenditure is 150 million pounds. The repayment of U.S. and Canadian loans, and the effort to maintain a trade surplus that can be used for overseas capital exports, are all major drains. In addition, Britain now pays foreigners only 55 million pounds less in interest and dividends on their investments in Britain than it receives from overseas investments. It is no wonder that Britain's gold and dollar reserves are less than in 1946. Needless to say, the 35 million pounds spent on the military aggression in Suez and its economic consequences have further jeopardized Britain's balance of payments. Britain's balance of payments reflects the bankruptcy of imperialist policies and the fundamental changes in the international position of British imperialism.

    Restricting the full development of trade relations with China and the Soviet Union has further weakened Britain's position. This fact is increasingly recognized as Britain's trade situation becomes increasingly difficult.

    The Conservative Attack

    Since 1945, Britain has experienced a fairly long period of inflation. The retail price index was 100 in 1947 and 157 in 1956; the wholesale price index for necessities was 100 in 1949 and 161.1 in December 1956.

    This long-term inflation is mainly driven by the unlimited increase in national military expenditure. The significant increase in fixed capital investment in recent years is also a reason.

    The result of these phenomena together is the continuous devaluation of the pound sterling. It is well known that this inflation has been used by large enterprises to reduce the real wages of the people and seek huge profits. They are increasingly openly declaring the need for an unemployment army of more than one million people, which would make their so-called "labor mobility" possible. This approach is first intended to destroy the power of trade unions in negotiations, and also to strengthen the speeding-up system, thereby increasing the rate of surplus value. In the name of curbing inflation, the Conservative government has cut various subsidies. The British ruling class has tightened social services and is now asking people to pay for some services that were originally free, which were originally maintained by ordinary taxes. Currently, they are passing a rent bill. It is estimated that this bill will squeeze 100 to 200 million pounds from residents, and this money will fall into the pockets of landlords.

    Our experience in Britain shows that even if there are some increases in the number of unemployed and shortened working hours, inflation may continue to occur. Compared with 1955, the actual consumption of the masses did not increase in 1956. However, the retail and wholesale price indexes have risen, and the number of unemployed and shortened working hours has also increased.

    The impact of the Conservative Party's policies has stagnated British production last year and limited the general level of investment. Measures taken to preserve the position of British imperialists have instead further weakened the economic foundation of its position. Nothing proves the fragility of British monopoly capitalism more than this fact.

    The Struggle for a New Policy

    Almost all Britons are increasingly feeling the consequences of the Conservative Party's economic policies. Not only industrial workers, but also salaried workers and professionals are affected by rising prices, declining living standards, and the tightening of social services. Thus, the objective conditions for forming a very broad alliance against the policies of British monopoly capitalism have arisen.

    The struggle for a new economic policy that meets the interests of the masses is actually inseparable from the struggle for the establishment of a new government.

    The British Communist Party has put forward a program of immediate action, and the struggle to defeat the Conservative government is unfolding around this program.

    This program is:

    1. Pursue a policy of peaceful coexistence; sign a European security treaty; admit the People's Republic of China into the United Nations and develop East-West trade.

    2. Recognize the independence and autonomy of all colonial peoples.

    3. Reach international agreements on disarmament; stop all further testing of atomic and hydrogen bombs; use resources to expand social services and improve people's living conditions.

    4. Increase wages, pensions and living allowances, lower prices; stop credit tightening and restore various subsidies; require monopolists to reduce exploitation in order to improve the situation of workers.

    5. Maintain full employment, stop layoffs and reduce working hours.

    6. Nationalize the main industrial sectors on the basis of socialism, and thoroughly improve those industrial sectors that have already been nationalized.

    Experience since 1945 shows that one should not underestimate the strength of British imperialism. However, its problems are serious and it is facing a strong and organized British working class. If the British working class can see what it needs to do for its own interests, and cooperate with all socialist forces and national liberation forces in the world, then its power will be irresistible, and Britain will embark on a new path in economic and foreign policy.

    英国保守党的经济政策
    英国　山姆·阿罗诺维奇
    保守党政府在苏伊士运河问题上的军事冒险，说明英帝国主义者对于它在世界上的地位的衰落感到多么忧虑。
    英帝国主义国际地位的下降
    英帝国主义在世界上的地位，早已经发生了根本的变化。只是由于第二次世界大战后出现了许多有利的特点，把英国国际地位全面下降的事实暂时掩蔽了起来。这些有利的特点是：像德国和日本这些英国的竞争对手的暂时毁灭，国内外恢复工作的巨大需要，有利于英国货物输出的世界性的黄金美元荒。
    英国垄断资本利用这些有利条件，成功地实现了出口方面的巨大扩张。它扩大了资金积累，在国内外建立工厂；它重新建立起这样一种势力，使得世界一半的贸易都用英镑来进行；它加强了对殖民地的剥削，殖民地的英镑结余达十三亿之多；它限制了英国人民的消费和工资的增加。
    尽管如此，在战后十二年里，英国国际地位发生了变化这一事实，还是越来越突出了。
    在英国遭到巨大削弱的时候，英帝国主义力图重建它在世界上的殖民地位，这种努力在过去这一段时间里使得它依附于美帝国主义。作为援助的代价，美国托辣斯不仅坚持要达成限制英国在内政、外交方面的自主权的协议，而且已经急剧地增加了它们对英帝国和英国国内市场的投资和渗入。在英国的许多工业部门中，美国的投资已经占有决定性的势力。
    英国同美国连在一起，结果是后者设法要把前者撵出世界上的某些地区，例如中东。最近出笼的“艾森豪威尔主义”，不过是美国利用英帝国主义的困难的一个最新的例子罢了。
    英国的帝国主义政策的一部分代价，就是每年要有十五亿英镑的军费负担；这个数字将近国民收入的10％，平均使每个英国人每年负担约三十英镑。
    尽管英国的出口有所增加，但是英国在世界贸易中所占的份额不断减少，这方面的比率1950年是26％，1954年是21％，而1955年是20％。
    企图保全英帝国主义的努力，也在支付的平衡方面招致了灾难性的后果。英国每年的海外军事开支是一亿五千万英镑。美、加贷款的偿还，为维持可以向海外进行资本输出的出超而作的努力，都是重大的消耗。此外，英国现在付给外国在英国投资的利息和红利，仅比它从海外投资所得到的少五千五百万英镑。英国的黄金、美元储备比1946年为少，这是无足为奇的。不消说，花在苏伊士的军事侵略方面的三千五百万英镑以及它的经济后果，已经进一步危害了英国的支付平衡。英国的支付平衡表反映了帝国主义政策的破产和英帝国主义国际地位的根本变化。
    限制同中国和苏联充分发展贸易关系，使得英国的地位更遭削弱。由于英国贸易情况的日益困难，愈来愈多的人都承认了这个事实。
    保守党的进攻
    自从1945年以来，英国存在着相当长期的通货膨胀现象。零售价格的指数在1947年是一百，而1956年是一百五十七；必需品的批发价格的指数在1949年是一百，而1956年12月是一百六十一点一。
    这种长期的通货膨胀现象主要是由国家军费开支的无限增加而促成的。近年来固定资本投资的显著增加也是一个原因。
    这些现象凑到一起的结果就是英镑的不断贬值。大家都知道，这种通货膨胀现象已经被大企业利用来降低人民的实际工资，并谋取巨额利润。他们愈来愈公开地宣布需要一支一百万人以上的失业队伍，这会使他们所谓的“劳工流动性”成为可能。这种作法首先是打算摧毁工会在谈判中的力量，也是打算加强赶快制度，从而提高剩余价值率。以制止通货膨胀为名，保守党政府已经削减了各种津贴。英国统治阶级已经紧缩社会服务事业，同时正在要人民向本来是免费的一些事业缴费，这些事业本来是由普通的税收来维持的。目前，他们正在通过一项房租法案。据估计，这个法案将从住户的身上挤出一亿到两亿英镑，而这笔钱将落到房主的口袋里。
    我们在英国的经验表明：即使是失业以及缩短工时的人数有了某些增加，通货膨胀现象还可能继续发生。同1955年相比，1956年人民群众的实际消费量并没有增长。但是，零售和批发价格的指数却上升了，失业和缩短工时的人数也增加了。
    保守党政策的影响已经在去年使英国的生产停滞，并且局限了投资的一般水平。企图保全英帝国主义者的地位的措施反而更多地削弱了它的地位的经济基础。没有什么东西比这一事实更能证明英国垄断资本主义的脆弱了。
    争取新政策的斗争
    几乎全体英国人民，都愈来愈感受到保守党的经济政策的后果。不仅产业工人，而且薪金劳动者和专业工作者都受到物价上涨、生活水平降低和社会服务事业紧缩的影响。于是，为了反对英国垄断资本主义的政策而结成十分广泛的联盟的客观条件就产生了。
    为争取一个符合人民群众利益的新的经济政策而斗争，实际上同为争取成立一个新政府而斗争是分不开的。
    英国共产党已经提出了一个立即行动的纲领，击败保守党政府的斗争正围绕着这个纲领在展开。
    这个纲领是：
    一、奉行一种和平共处的政策；签订欧洲安全公约；接纳中华人民共和国进入联合国以及发展东西方贸易。
    二、承认所有殖民地人民的独立自主权。
    三、达成裁军方面的国际协议；停止一切原子弹和氢弹的进一步试验；把资源用来扩大社会服务事业并改善人民的生活条件。
    四、增加工资、养老金和生活津贴，降低物价；停止紧缩信贷并恢复各种津贴；要求垄断资本家减少剥削以便改善工人的境况。
    五、维持充分就业，停止解雇并减少工时。
    六、在社会主义的基础上把各主要工业部门收归国有，并彻底改进那些已经收归国有的工业部门。
    自从1945年以来的经验说明，人们不应该低估英帝国主义的力量。可是，它的问题是严重的，并且正面对着强大的有组织的英国工人阶级。如果英国工人阶级能够看清为了自己的利益需要做些什么，并且同全世界一切社会主义力量以及民族解放力量合作，那么，它的力量就是不可抗拒的，而英国也就要在经济和外交政策方面踏上新的途径。
