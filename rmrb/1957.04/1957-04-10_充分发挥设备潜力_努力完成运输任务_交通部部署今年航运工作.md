Xinhua News Agency, April 9th. The Ministry of Communications held a meeting of directors of directly affiliated shipping bureaus from March 23rd to April 9th. This meeting, based on summarizing last year's work and in accordance with the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy as instructed by the Central Committee, studied and deployed this year's shipping work.

This year's national waterway transportation task is heavy. The national waterway freight turnover will increase by 6.4% compared to last year, of which the portion directly under the Ministry of Communications will increase by 11.7% compared to last year. The throughput of the six major coastal ports will also increase by 6.4% compared to last year. With the deepening of the nationwide movement to increase production and practice economy, the volume of transportation on various routes and the throughput of ports will increase to varying degrees. Among them, the transportation volume of Sichuan grain is estimated to increase by about 23% compared to the plan.

To meet the needs of shipping development, in this year's basic construction of shipping affairs, in addition to adding more than 110,000 tons of new ships, key ports such as Hankou, Chongqing, and Shanghai on the Yangtze River, as well as Basuo on the west coast of Hainan Island, will be expanded. This year's total investment in basic construction of shipping affairs will increase by about 10% compared to last year's estimated completion.

The meeting pointed out that to complete this year's transportation tasks, one cannot simply rely on the capacity of newly added transportation equipment, but must instead make greater efforts to fully tap the potential of existing transportation equipment. For example, if the non-productive berthing time of ships in Yangtze River ports can be shortened by 5% this year, it can increase the transportation volume by 120 million ton-kilometers; if the non-productive berthing time of ships can be reduced by 20%, the increased transportation volume will reach about 500 million ton-kilometers. This transportation volume is equivalent to 5% of the Yangtze River's transportation volume this year.

The meeting put forward various measures for this year's shipping work. The main content of these measures is to do a good job in the planned balancing of transportation, so that the work of all parties, especially the work of ships and ports, is coordinated, and at the same time, to do a good job in external cooperation. To effectively implement these measures and ensure the completion and strive for over-fulfillment of this year's waterway transportation plan, it is necessary to extensively and deeply carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy in shipping enterprises, strengthen the political and ideological education of employees, and improve leadership style.

In the movement to increase production and practice economy, special attention should be paid to improving the quality of transportation and ensuring transportation safety. If there are no maritime losses, cargo losses, or mechanical damage accidents, and navigation is safe, it is a significant increase in production and practice of economy in transportation.

### 充分发挥设备潜力　努力完成运输任务  交通部部署今年航运工作

    充分发挥设备潜力　努力完成运输任务
    交通部部署今年航运工作
    新华社9日讯　交通部在3月23日到4月9日召开了直属航运局局长会议。这次会议在总结去年工作的基础上，根据中央指示的增产节约的精神，研究和部署了今年的航运工作。
    今年全国水路运输的任务是繁重的。全国水路的货运周转量将比去年增长6.4％，其中交通部直属部分将比去年增长11.7％。沿海六大港口的吞吐量也将比去年增长6.4％。随着全国范围的增产节约运动的深入开展，各个航线的运量和港口吞吐量还会有不同程度的增加，其中川粮的运输量估计将要比计划增加23％左右。
    适应航运发展的需要，国家在今年航务的基本建设中，除了增加十一万多吨的新的船舶外，还将有重点地扩建长江上的汉口、重庆和上海以及海南岛西海岸的八所等港口。今年整个航务基本建设的投资将比去年预计完成数增长10％左右。
    会议指出，要完成今年的运输任务，不能单纯地依靠新增的运输设备的能力，而必须更多地充分发挥现有运输设备的潜在力量。例如，船舶在长江港口的非生产停泊时间，今年如果能够缩短5％，就可以增加一亿二千万吨公里的运量；如果船舶非生产停泊时间能够减少20％，那么增加的运输量将达五亿左右吨公里。这个运量相当于长江今年运量的5％。
    会议提出了今年航运工作的各项措施。这些措施的主要内容就是要搞好运输的计划平衡工作，使各方面的工作特别是船舶和港口的工作协调配合，同时要搞好同外部的协作关系。要很好的实现这些措施，保证完成和力争超额完成今年的水路运输计划，必须在航运企业中广泛深入地开展增产节约运动，加强对职工的政治思想教育，改进领导作风。
    在增产节约运动中，要特别注意提高运输的质量，确保运输的安全。如果不出海损、货损和机损事故，航行安全，也就是运输中的很大的增产节约。
