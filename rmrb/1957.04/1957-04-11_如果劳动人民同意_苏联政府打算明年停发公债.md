Xinhua News Agency, 10th: TASS reports: Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, said at a meeting in Gorky on the 8th that the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Soviet government believe that, as long as the working people agree, the Soviet Union will stop issuing national public debt from 1958 onwards, with the exception of the 3% freely circulating domestic lottery bonds.

He said that if this is done, then the last Soviet national public debt will be issued in 1957, and the amount of public debt issued will no longer be the originally stipulated 26 billion rubles, but will be reduced to 12 billion rubles.

Khrushchev made these remarks at a meeting of agricultural workers from several states and autonomous republics of the Russian Federation. He also said that there is one condition for stopping the issuance of public debt, which is to postpone the payment of interest and principal on previously issued public debt. The Central Committee of the CPSU and the Soviet government suggest postponing the repayment of previous public debt for twenty to twenty-five years. They believe that the funds the government obtains from the frozen public debt must be used to meet the needs of the people and improve their lives.

Khrushchev called on the participants of the meeting to support the suggestions of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Soviet government, if they believe that this is the right thing to do.

He also said that in the forty years since the establishment of the Soviet regime, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people have transformed their motherland from a backward agricultural country into a country whose industrial output ranks second in the world. The Soviet Union has far surpassed some highly industrialized countries such as Britain and France, and has surpassed them so far that they cannot catch up with the Soviet Union.

Khrushchev emphasized the enormous role that national public debt has played in the world-historically significant achievements of the Soviet people.

The proposal of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Soviet government was unanimously supported at this meeting, as well as at a meeting of more than 20,000 workers at the "Red Sormovo" factory in Gorky and a meeting of 50,000 people at the Gorky Automobile Factory.

    如果劳动人民同意
    苏联政府打算明年停发公债
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联共产党中央委员会第一书记赫鲁晓夫8日在高尔基城召开的一个集会上说，苏共中央和苏联政府认为，只要劳动人民同意，苏联将从1958年起停止发行国家公债，而三厘自由流通国内有奖公债除外。
    他说，如果这样作，那么，苏联最后一次国家公债将在1957年发行，而且公债发行额不再是原来规定的二百六十亿卢布，而是减少到一百二十亿卢布。
    赫鲁晓夫是在俄罗斯联邦一些州和自治共和国农业工作者会议上说这番话的。他还说，停止发行公债有一个条件，这就是要对以前发行的公债延期付息还本。苏共中央和苏联政府建议把以前的公债延期二十年到二十五年偿还，它们认为，必须把政府从冻结的公债中所得的资金用于满足人民的需要和改善人民的生活。
    赫鲁晓夫号召会议的参加者支持苏共中央和苏联政府的建议，如果他们认为这样作是正确的话。
    他还说，苏维埃政权建立四十年以来，苏联人民在共产党领导下把自己的祖国从落后的农业国变成一个工业产品量占世界第二位的国家。苏联已经远远超过了像英国、法国这样一些高度工业化的国家，而且超过得这样远，以致它们别想再赶上苏联。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出了国家公债在苏联人民取得具有世界历史意义的成就方面所起的巨大作用。
    苏共中央和苏联政府的这项建议在这次集会上以及在高尔基城“红色索莫沃”工厂两万多工人集会和高尔基汽车工厂五万人大会上得到了一致的支持。
