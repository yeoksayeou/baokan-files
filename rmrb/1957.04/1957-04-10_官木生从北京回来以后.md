Accountant Hong Lesan was calculating accounts, the telephone ringing incessantly, making him feel quite annoyed. He picked up the receiver, frowned, and asked rudely, "Hello? Hello? Hello?" He only heard the other side say, "The director of your cooperative is back!" Immediately, his brow relaxed and his eyes widened, and he jumped up, shouting, "The director is back! The director is back!" The news that Guan Musheng, having attended the National Agricultural Labor Model Representative Conference, had returned from Beijing spread like a spring breeze throughout all the production teams of the Changfeng Cooperative. When the members of the First Production Team heard that the director had returned to the cooperative, the entire team wanted to go and welcome him. The production team leader said, "We can't delay production. We must welcome the director's glorious return with increased production." In the end, everyone sent two representatives with two large gongs to wait on the main road. When the Third Production Team Leader, Tu Jianxun, heard that the director had returned, he rushed to the office to wait.

Guan Youwen, a member of the First Production Team, was spreading manure in the rapeseed field by the road from the village north to Pengxingdian that day. Looking up, he saw several people coming out of the Weijiacha intersection. The one in the middle was Guan Musheng. This was a complete surprise. He shouted from afar, "The director is back! It's glorious!" Guan Musheng rushed forward, stepped into the field, took Guan Youwen's hand, and said, "It's everyone's glory! You've worked hard at home." The two of them held hands and grinned. Guan Musheng asked, "How is production going?" Guan Youwen said, "The wheat ditches have all been cleared, fertilizer has been applied, and everyone is working hard on water conservancy. The members are very enthusiastic!"

Guan Musheng told the people who were walking with him to take the luggage back, and he himself took a shortcut with the branch secretary, Yan Youyu, and the deputy director, Zhao Zhongfang, to the farming area of the First Production Team. What he saw was indeed that the fields and ditches were neat and tidy, and fertilizer had been applied to every plot. The only exception was that the green manure fields had received little fertilizer, some even none at all. Guan Musheng then met the production group leader, Zhao Lianjing, and asked him, "Why haven't the green manure fields been fertilized?" Zhao Lianjing said, "We all know the principle of using a little fertilizer to grow more fertilizer; but this year we want to strive for a greater harvest, and fertilizer is still insufficient."

Guan Musheng went from the First Team to the Third Team. The Third Production Team Leader, Tu Jianxun, had been waiting anxiously in the office. At this time, his child ran from home and called out, "The director is asking for you at home!" Tu Jianxun exclaimed, "Ah?!" got up and ran home, muttering, "Director, why not take the main road but take the small road, not go home when you come back to the cooperative, nor come to the office."

Guan Musheng went from the Third Team to the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Teams. It was dark when he finally returned home. The two member representatives of the First Team who had been waiting with large gongs on the main road were disappointed.

In the evening, Guan Musheng talked with the cadres and members of the Second Production Team about the cooperative's fertilizer problem. Guan Musheng asked everyone:

"To complete this year's production plan, is there enough fertilizer?"

"Compared to last year, there is more fertilizer, but to complete this year's increased production plan, the fertilizer is still far from enough," Second Team Leader Guan Fucheng replied after considering it.

"Then why isn't everyone accumulating fertilizer?"

"Where can we find fertilizer? We've been running this cooperative in this village for several years, and the pond mud has long been dug out, and the mountain walls have been replaced. To accumulate fertilizer, I think we can only buy some rhubarb (laxative)," Guan Denghong said, which made everyone laugh.

Guan Musheng said, "I don't think it's really that there's no fertilizer to accumulate. For example, the ditch beside the rice field can be cleaned up. There are rice husks and rotten straw there. Sweeping them up a bit will definitely provide fertilizer. Also, in front of every house, on the slopes in front of the steps, when children poop and pee, digging it up is also fertilizer. Do you think these have fertilizer?"

"They do. It's said that the poop is eaten by the dogs, but the pee is eaten by the soil!" said the elderly member Guan Daofu. Everyone laughed again.

Member Guan Shaoqing disagreed. He raised a question, saying, "Would that be worthwhile? After working for a long time, we won't be able to fertilize even a palm-sized piece of land. One labor unit costs more than a dollar. The fertilizer from a purchased cake will fertilize more land than this bit of dirt."

Everyone thought this made sense, and they became dispirited again.

Guan Musheng then asked everyone, "One labor unit is worth one dollar and ten cents. Where does this money come from?"

This sentence shone like a light, illuminating everyone's hearts. Without fertilizer, there would be no good harvest. Without a good harvest, the value of work points would be low. Everyone then understood that Guan Shaoqing had calculated the account backward.

The next day, Guan Musheng got up early, took a shovel, and went to dig the ditch beside the rice field. Production Team Leader Guan Fucheng also came. As soon as the two started, Production Group Leader Guan Meiqiao also arrived. The three of them dug, carried, and worked together. After a while, other members saw that the director had personally taken action, so they also brought tools to dig. Three became five, five became ten, and soon dozens of men and women, young and old, in the village started working. The ditches around several rice fields in the village were turned over, and the rice field skin, grass clippings from in front of and behind the houses, and topsoil were carried pile by pile.

As Guan Musheng dug, he thought of a place. In the alley to the left of his house was a large Tianchi (pond), where a total of seven households went in and out. When it was hot, bathwater and washing water were poured here. He also remembered when he was young, there was an old jujube tree here. He and the children picked jujubes to eat, and the leaves fell and rotted into fertilizer. Now, that jujube tree had been cut down long ago because they were afraid it would fall and crush the house, but when it rained, the black mud underfoot still reached above the ankles. So he went with another member to dig this Tianchi. The soil in a several-zhang area was turned over a layer, dug more than half a foot deep.

On this day, the fertilizer that Guan Musheng and the members accumulated piled up as high as a mountain wall, enough to fertilize three shi and five dou of land. One member said with a smile, "Standing on the pile of fertilizer, we can really see Beijing at a glance!"

The fact that Guan Musheng was digging rice field ditches and digging up topsoil with the members quickly became known throughout the cooperative, and many people in the whole township and district also knew about it. A new upsurge of fertilizer accumulation was set off throughout the district.

    官木生从北京回来以后
    程度　涂允恒
    会计洪乐三正在算账，电话机铃子叮呤呤直响，心里好不烦躁，拿起话筒皱起眉头粗声粗气地问：“哪里？哪里？哪里？”只听见那边说：“你们社主任回来了！”他顿时眉舒眼开，放下听筒跳起来大叫：“主任回来了！主任回来了！”官木生开罢了全国农业劳动模范代表会议从北京回来的消息像一阵春风马上就传遍了长风社各生产队。第一生产队社员听到主任回社消息全队社员都要去接，生产队长说：“不能耽误生产，我们要以加劲生产来迎接主任光荣归来。”最后大家派了两个代表，提了两面大锣去大路上等着。第三生产队长涂建勋听说主任回来了，就飞奔到办公室去等候。
    第一生产队社员官幼文那天正在村北到朋兴店去的大路旁的油菜田里泼粪，抬头望见几个人出了魏家岔路走过来。中间的正是官木生。这一下真是喜出望外，老远就高声喊叫：“主任回来了！光荣哪！”官木生抢上前去，下田拉住官幼文的手说：“大家的光荣！你们在家辛苦了。”二人拉着手咧着嘴直笑。官木生问：“生产搞得怎样啊？”官幼文说：“麦子沟都清了，肥也追了，大家正在兴修水利，社员们劲头可大着哩！”
    官木生叫一起走的人把行李包带回去，自己就跟支部书记晏有余和副主任赵仲芳抄小路到第一生产队的耕作区去。他看到的果然是田间沟路整齐，块块都追上了肥料，就只是种植绿肥的田下得肥少，有些甚至没下肥料。官木生又碰见了生产组长赵连敬，便问他：“为什么绿肥田没追肥？”赵连敬说：“小肥养大肥，道理都知道；可是今年要争取更大丰收，肥料还是不足啊。”
    官木生从一队又转到了三队。第三生产队队长涂建勋在办公室已等得坐立不安了。这时他的小孩从家里跑来喊他说：“主任在家里问你哩？”涂建勋“啊？！”了一声，起身就往家里跑，口里还只管说：“主任呵，大路不走走小路，回社来家里不去，办公室也不来。”
    官木生从三队又走到四队、五队、六队。天黑了，他才回到家里。提着大锣在大路上等候的第一队的两个社员代表落空了。
    晚上，官木生跟第二生产队的干部和社员谈到了社里肥料的问题。官木生问大家：
    “要完成今年生产计划，肥料够不够呢？”
    “比起去年肥料是多一些，但要完成今年增产计划，肥料还差很远。”二队队长官福成考虑了一下这样回答。
    “那大家为什么不积肥呢？”
    “往那里找肥料呢？我们这个塆子搞这几年社，塘泥早挖光了，山墙也换完了。要积肥我看只有买点大黄（泻药）来。”官登洪这样一说，把几个人都逗笑了。
    官木生说：“我看也不是真的没肥可积，譬如稻场边上的沟都可以清清，那里谷颖子，烂稻草，撮撮扫扫，一定有肥气。再有，家家门口阶前坡，小孩子痾屎痾尿，挖一挖也是肥料。你们说这些有没有肥气？”
    “那是有的，就说屎都被狗吃了，尿却是被土吃了的！”老年社员官道富这样说。大家又被他逗笑了。
    社员官少卿不同意，他提出个问题说：“那会划得来？搞半天肥不了巴掌大一块田。一个工一块多钱呀，买的饼会比这点渣子土肥的田多得多。”
    大家一想这话也有道理，又消沉了。
    官木生这时问大家一句：“一个工值一元一，这钱是从那里来的呢？”
    这一句话像一道光把大家的心都照亮了。没有肥料，不能丰收，没有丰收，工分价值就低了。大家才明白官少卿是把账算颠倒了。
    第二天，官木生清早起来拿了把锹去挖稻场边上的沟。生产队长官福成也来了。二人刚动手，生产组长官梅桥又来了。三个人挖的挖，挑的挑，干了起来。一会儿，别的社员看主任亲自下了手，就也带了家具来挖。三个变五个，五个变十个，一会全塆子几十个男女老少都动起手来。塆子里几面稻场的沟都被翻起来，稻场皮、屋前屋后草渣子、地皮土一挑一挑的堆起来。
    官木生挖着挖着想起了一个地方。在他住的房子的左边巷子里有一个大天池，这里一共有七户人家进进出出，天热了洗澡水、洗衣水都往这里倒。他还记得幼年的时候，这里有一棵老枣树，自己和小孩子们打枣吃，树叶子都掉下来沤成了肥。如今那枣树因为怕倒下来砸了房子早就伐掉了，可是天一下雨，脚踩下去黑泥还是要没到脚脖以上。他就又同一个社员去挖这天池。方圆几丈地方，土整整翻了一层，挖有半尺多深。
    这一天，官木生跟社员们积的肥堆起来有一座山墙高，足足够肥三石五斗田。有个社员笑着说：“站到肥堆上，真能够一眼看到北京去！”
    官木生跟社员们一起挖稻场沟、刨地皮土的事很快全社都知道了，全乡、全区也有很多人知道了。一个新的积肥热潮在全区掀起来了。
