(Reported by our correspondent Zhen Weimin from Nanjing on the 27th) After studying Chairman Mao's speech on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, the Qingpu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Jiangsu Province made a concrete analysis of the current contradictions between the state, the collective, and the individual in the county's rural areas. It also proposed several methods for resolving contradictions, including the "Five Wants and Five Don'ts" for implementing democratic cooperative management.

Currently, the following three types of contradictions are prominent in rural Qingpu County.

First, there are contradictions within agricultural cooperatives between cooperative cadres and members, and between individual interests and collective interests. For example, a few cooperative cadres do not consult with the masses on matters, and members blindly develop individual sideline occupations, affecting the cooperative's production. A more common situation is that the cooperative's production cannot meet the members' growing living demands, or the distribution is improper.

Second, there are contradictions between the cooperative and the state, and between needs and possibilities. After collectivization, the peasants' enthusiasm for production has soared to unprecedented levels, and they have demanded large quantities of fertilizer, feed, and other production and living materials from the state. The state cannot fully supply them for the time being, so some cooperatives have gone to other places to raise prices and snap up goods.

Third, there are also disputes between cooperatives, counties, and collectives. For example, agricultural cooperatives compete to dredge river mud, agricultural cooperatives and fishing cooperatives compete for water surface, agricultural cooperatives and handicraft cooperatives compete for sales markets, and agricultural cooperatives in this county and neighboring counties compete to transport manure.

In response to the above analysis, the Qingpu County Committee has decided to start from four aspects to solve the contradictions in rural life. (1) The fundamental way to solve contradictions is to correctly implement the policy of democratic cooperative management, improve the relationship between cooperative cadres and members, and promote the "Five Wants and Five Don'ts" to be jointly observed by members and cooperative cadres: First, want unity and mutual assistance, discuss matters, and don't make trouble; second, want to respect the rights and labor achievements of others, and don't harm others to benefit oneself; third, want to maintain social order, and don't swear or resort to violence; fourth, want to abide by state policies and laws, correctly develop production, and don't engage in speculation; fifth, want to ensure safe production and prevent accidents.

(2) Improve leadership methods and work style, overcome bureaucracy, and require party organizations and administrative leaders at the county, district, and township levels to strengthen investigation and research, go deep into practice to solve problems, and at the same time, transfer cadres to strengthen grassroots leadership in townships and cooperatives, especially to strengthen leadership in backward cooperatives, and do everything possible to strive for a bumper agricultural harvest this year.

(3) Strengthen political and ideological education from within the Party to outside the Party, and conduct education on patriotism, collectivism, and hard struggle for the vast number of cadres and peasants. At the same time, special attention should be paid to conducting unity education, and all possible positive factors should be mobilized.

(4) Conscientiously implement the policy of "overall planning, taking all factors into consideration, and appropriate arrangement." When dealing with disputes between cooperatives, we should start from the perspective of benefiting production and strengthening unity, and reach a proper settlement through persuasion and consultation. When dealing with contradictions between agricultural cooperatives and fishing cooperatives and handicraft cooperatives, we should adhere to the principle of not affecting the lives of fishermen and handicraftsmen. We must constantly conduct "problem" screening, and take measures as early as possible for work that may cause problems. Practical difficulties of cadres and the masses should be resolved realistically, and those that cannot be resolved should be explained repeatedly and patiently.

    青浦县将在农业社中提倡“五要五不要”
    根本改善社干部和社员的关系
    本报南京27日电　本报记者甄为民报道：中共江苏省青浦县委学习毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的讲话以后，对当前本县农村实际存在的国家、集体、个人三者之间的矛盾作了具体分析，并提出了贯彻民主办社的“五要五不要”等几条解决矛盾问题的办法。
    当前青浦县农村突出地存在着下述三种矛盾。
    首先是农业社内部社干部和社员、个人利益和集体利益之间的矛盾。如少数社干部有事不和群众商量，社员盲目发展个人副业，影响到社里的生产。比较普遍的情况是社里的生产不能满足社员日益增长的生活要求，或分配不当。
    其次，是社和国家、需要和可能的矛盾。合作化后，农民的生产积极性空前高涨，向国家提出要大量的肥料、饲料和其他生产及生活资料，国家一时不能充分供应，因此有的社到外地抬价抢购。
    再次，社与社、县与县、集体与集体之间也有纠纷。如农业社和农业社争捞河泥，农业社和渔业社争水面，农业社和手工业社争销售市场，本县农业社和邻县农业社争运粪肥等。
    针对以上分析的情况，青浦县委研究决定从四个方面着手解决农村现实生活中的矛盾。（一）解决矛盾的根本办法是要正确地贯彻民主办社方针，改善社干部和社员的关系，并在社员和社干部中提倡共同做到“五要五不要”：一、要团结互助，有事商量，不要闹事生非；二、要尊重别人的权利和劳动成果，不要损人利己；三、要维护社会秩序，不要开口骂人，动手打人；四、要遵守国家政策法令，正确地发展生产，不要投机取巧；五、要安全生产，不要发生事故。
    （二）改进领导方法和工作作风，克服官僚主义，要求县、区、乡各级党的组织和行政领导人员加强调查研究，深入到实际中去解决问题，同时抽调干部加强对乡、社的基层领导，特别加强对落后社的领导，千方百计争取今年农业大丰收。
    （三）从党内到党外，加强政治思想教育，对广大干部和农民群众进行爱国主义、集体主义和艰苦奋斗的教育。同时要特别注意进行团结教育，把一切可能调动的积极因素都发动起来。
    （四）要认真贯彻“统筹兼顾、适当安排”的方针。在处理社与社的纠纷时，应从有利于生产、加强团结出发，经过说服和协商达到妥善处理。在处理农业社与渔业社、手工业社的矛盾时，应当以不影响渔民和手工业者的生活为原则。要经常不断地进行“问题”排队，对可能发生问题的工作，及早采取措施。对干部群众的实际困难要实事求是地解决，对不能解决的要反复耐心地说清楚。
