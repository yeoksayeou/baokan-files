Xinhua News Agency dispatch:

    Haining County, Zhejiang Province, is building an electric irrigation project. When this project is completed, it can irrigate 460,000 mu of farmland. The entire project will be completed in the second half of this year and before the spring plowing next year.
    Haining is one of the main producing areas of ramie in Zhejiang. Because the terrain is high in the north and low in the south, the north is often affected by drought after June every year. The south is a network of canals, connecting to Taihu Lake, but the north cannot utilize it. Therefore, the yield per unit area of Haining ramie has always been low. After the construction of the pumping stations with the strong pumping capacity of the electric irrigation project, the irrigation water source in the northern region can be guaranteed.

    海宁兴建电力灌溉工程
    据新华社讯　浙江省海宁县正在兴建一座电力灌溉工程。这座工程全部竣工后，可以灌溉四十六万亩农田。全部工程将分别在今年下半年和明年春耕之前完成。
    海宁是浙江络麻主要产地之一，由于地势北部高南部低，每年到6月以后，北部便经常受旱。南部是运河水系，贯通太湖，但北部不能利用。因而海宁络麻的单位面积产量始终较低。在电力灌溉工程的强大抽水能力的翻水站建成以后，就可以保证北部地区的灌溉水源。
