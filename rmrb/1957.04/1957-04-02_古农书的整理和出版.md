China is one of the world's ancient civilizations, and has accumulated many advanced experiences and achieved many brilliant accomplishments in the struggle for agricultural production. However, ancient agricultural books that record these valuable experiences have not received due attention in the long feudal society. Many have been lost, and even those that have survived are mostly available in few copies and are not easy to find. Moreover, ancient books have often been copied and reprinted repeatedly, which can lead to errors and omissions, damaging the value of the original books. The language of ancient texts differs from modern spoken language, and there are also differences in ancient and modern dialects and terminology, which often make it difficult for general readers to understand or to understand correctly. In addition, there is a lot of relevant information scattered in other ancient books, making it difficult to find.

Therefore, in order to facilitate the study, utilization, and development of our nation's agricultural heritage, we need to do three preparatory tasks: (1) sort and publish ancient agricultural books; (2) collect as much relevant information scattered in various books as possible, classify and concentrate it, and compile various albums of the "Selected Collection of Chinese Agricultural Heritage"; (3) compile a "General Catalog and Abstract of Ancient Chinese Agricultural Books and Related Books." Now, all three tasks have begun. In June last year, the preparatory group of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences also held a symposium to discuss and arrange the reprinting of ancient agricultural books. In the past six months, the Zhonghua Book Company has published eighteen ancient agricultural books and two albums.

Most of these ancient agricultural books are selected for their relative importance and representativeness, and a few are based on existing printing plates. These books have been processed to varying degrees. At the very least, all books have been punctuated or given new punctuation marks. Some have also been collated to correct errors and omissions in the books. Some have been further annotated, verified, and explored. Unfortunately, some of the collation, annotation, and verification of ancient books cannot be done in a short period of time, so we can only do some sorting within the possible scope, or we have to print according to the ordinary version to meet urgent needs. This is just a beginning, and there is much work waiting for us to do.

Now, I will briefly introduce these twenty books separately:

1.  "Annotations and Explanations of Shang Nong and Other Four Chapters of Lüshi Chunqiu," written by Lü Buwei et al. at the end of the Warring States period (3rd century BC), annotated and explained by Xia Weiying. China had specialized agricultural books in the Warring States period, but unfortunately they have been lost, and only some fragments have been preserved. The more complete ones are the four chapters of Shang Nong, Ren Di, Bian Tu, and Shen Shi in "Lüshi Chunqiu." However, it is difficult to read. After Mr. Xia's annotations and explanations, these four chapters are easy to understand. Mr. Xia's annotations are very careful. Except for a few individual places that still need to be discussed, they are basically correct.

2.  "Collected Annotations of Fan Shengzhi's Book," written by Fan Shengzhi of the Han Dynasty (second half of the 1st century BC), compiled and annotated by Wan Guoding. This is the most famous agricultural book of the Han Dynasty. The original book was lost early, but it is often quoted in later agricultural books. There are three collections of lost fragments from the Qing Dynasty, which are not good. In addition to extensive collection and collation, this "Collected Annotations" also provides detailed verification, annotation, and exploration, with special attention to agricultural technology issues. It differs greatly in style and opinion from Mr. Shi Shenghan's "Modern Explanation of Fan Shengzhi's Book" (published by Science Press), which can be compared.

3.  "Qi Min Yao Shu," written by Jia Sixie of the Later Wei Dynasty (30s of the 6th century). This is the oldest complete agricultural book existing in China, and it has always enjoyed a high reputation. It has more than 20 versions, all of which have some shortcomings, and the content is broad, and some places are not easy to understand. We are conducting a more thorough collation, verification (including field investigation), and annotation, but it cannot be completed in a short period of time. Now we have to temporarily print it according to the popular version.

4.  "Chen Fu's Agricultural Book," written by Chen Fu of the Song Dynasty (1149). In ancient agricultural books, this book can be regarded as a representative that focuses more on theory. There are indeed some experiential talks in the book, especially one volume on cattle in the small three-volume book, which is very prominent. Most of the agricultural books of the Tang and Song Dynasties have been lost, which makes the historical value of this book even more prominent. The book is appended with Lou Yu's "Geng Zhi Tu Shi" (Pictures and Poems of Plowing and Weaving) of the Song Dynasty.

5.  "Wang Zhen's Agricultural Book," written by Wang Zhen of the Yuan Dynasty (1313). This is a famous agricultural book of the Yuan Dynasty, comparable to Qi Min Yao Shu in the front and Nong Zheng Quan Shu in the back. The illustrated book of agricultural implements is especially the characteristic of this book. The original book was in thirty-six volumes, which were compiled from Yongle Encyclopedia in the Qing Dynasty and changed to twenty-two volumes. This book also needs to be collated and sorted out. Now its single edition is difficult to buy, so we will first print it out using the existing printing plates.

6.  "Nong Zheng Quan Shu," written by Xu Guangqi of the Ming Dynasty (1628), revised by Chen Zilong (1636), and collated by Zou Shuwen et al. This is the ancient agricultural book with the most words written by an individual in China. The author, Xu Guangqi, was very knowledgeable and had some experience in agriculture. He had an experimental field in his hometown of Shanghai. The book quotes many ancient books, but it also shows his own opinions everywhere. There are already six versions of this book. We specially organized Mr. Zou Shuwen and other seven people to conduct a careful collation.

7.  "Shen's Agricultural Book," written by Shen of the late Ming Dynasty (first half of the 17th century), supplemented by Zhang Lüxiang of the Qing Dynasty (1658), and punctuated by Chen Hengli. This book is also known as "Supplement to Agricultural Book." Shen was from Huzhou, and his name is lost; Zhang was from Tongxiang. What is said is mainly the agricultural technology of Huzhou and Jiaxing areas of Zhejiang, and although the book is small, the narrative is concise and detailed, and very practical.

8.  "Yang Yu Yue Ling," written by Dai Xi of the Ming Dynasty (1640). This book is mostly compiled from various books. Agricultural affairs are arranged according to the month, so it is called Yue Ling (Monthly Orders), but the back is divided into volumes for raising fish, bamboo, peony, peony, orchid, and chrysanthemum.

9.  "Shou Shi Tong Kao," officially written in the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty (1742). This was compiled by the Qing Dynasty taking materials from various ancient books, with very little originality; but compiling scattered materials together makes it easy to consult, and it also has its advantages.

10. "Nong Xue He Bian," written by Yang Gong of the Qing Dynasty (late 19th century). This book is also compiled from various books, somewhat like Shou Shi Tong Kao, but it is relatively rough.

11. "Hua Jing," written by Chen Haozi of the Qing Dynasty (1688), proofread by Chen Junyu. This book is about flowers; the last part also contains methods for raising poultry, animals, fish, shellfish, and insects, but mainly for ornamental purposes. The eighteen methods of flower cultivation are the characteristics of this book, which are very sophisticated.

12. "Hu Can Shu," written by Wang Rizhen of the Qing Dynasty (1874).

13. "Bi Nong Zui Yao," written by Chen Kaizhi of the Qing Dynasty (1897).

14. "Can Sang Cui Bian," written by Wei Jie of the Qing Dynasty (1900).

These three books are representative silkworm books of the Qing Dynasty. Huzhou, Zhejiang is a famous silkworm area in China, and "Hu Can Shu" records in detail the silkworm raising technology in this area. "Bi Nong Zui Yao" was written by an intellectual who has his own silkworm raising experience. "Can Sang Cui Bian" is compiled from various books, with the largest size.

15. "Si Mu An Ji Ji," name lost (9th century?), proofread and punctuated by Xie Chengxia.

16. "Yuan Heng Liao Ma Ji," written by Yu Benyuan and Yu Benheng of the Ming Dynasty (16th century), proofread by Xie Chengxia, Jin Chongye, etc.

These two books are veterinary monographs. Of the existing five volumes of Si Mu An Ji Ji, only one copy of the Ming Hongzhi reprint edition is completely preserved in the Nanjing Library. This time, Xie corrected and filled in the typographical errors and ink spots in the book based on this edition. There is a new publication and correction preface by Liu Yu Fuchang five (1135) before the book, which shows that the book was written at least before the Northern Song Dynasty. Mr. Xie believes that it was originally written by Li Shi of the Tang Dynasty (first half of the 9th century) and has been added and revised by later generations. "Yuan Heng Liao Ma Ji" is a book that has been widely circulated for nearly 400 years and is still a classic of traditional Chinese veterinary medicine; but the general version is very poor, and now it has been carefully proofread, with the cattle classic and camel classic attached at the end.

17. "Nong Hou Za Zhan," written by Liang Zhangju of the Qing Dynasty (1873). This book mainly predicts the harvest and good or bad fortune in agricultural affairs based on material images, including weather forecasting, but it also contains records unrelated to Nong Hou. Some of them are reasonable, and some are superstitious, so it is especially necessary to look at it with a critical attitude.

18. "Nong Ya," written by Ni Zhuo of the Qing Dynasty (1796). This book can be said to be an agricultural dictionary, with rich collection and reference value.

19. "Selected Collection of Chinese Agricultural Heritage - Rice (Volume 1)," edited by Chen Zugui of the Chinese Agricultural Heritage Research Office.

20. "Selected Collection of Chinese Agricultural Heritage - Wheat (Volume 1)," edited by Hu Xiwen of the Chinese Agricultural Heritage Research Office.

The nature of this set of "Selected Collection" has been described above. The Rice and Wheat albums are the first and second of Category A. It is not yet possible to determine how many albums will be published in total, but it will be more than 100 in total. These albums are roughly divided into four categories: Category A, monographs on plants; Category B, monographs on animals; Category C, agricultural technology; Category D, agricultural economy. A large amount of manpower is now being invested in collecting agricultural-related materials from local chronicles in various provinces, and these materials will be compiled into individual albums in the lower series according to geographical order. Therefore, only the upper series of the Rice and Wheat albums is currently published. The materials in the upper series are arranged in chronological order, and each material is marked with the author's name and writing date, and the original book is checked as much as possible, and the editor's notes are added when necessary. In addition, the upper series of the Cotton and Citrus albums have also been submitted for publication. More than a dozen other albums are being edited this year. (Wan Guoding)

    古农书的整理和出版
    我国是世界古国之一，在农业生产斗争中积累了许多先进经验，获得了许多辉煌成就。但是记录这些宝贵经验的古农书，由于在漫长的封建社会中得不到应有的重视，许多失散了，即使流传到现在的，大多数也是传本很少，不容易看到。而且古书经过转辗传抄翻刻，往往颇有错字脱文，损害了原书的价值。古文辞和现代口语不同，又有古今方言和名物异同等问题，往往使一般读者不容易看懂，或不能正确了解。此外还有很多有关资料，散见在其他多种古书中，查看很困难。
    因此，为了便于研究、利用和发扬祖国农业遗产，我们需要做三种准备工作：（1）整理出版古农书；（2）把散见群书的有关资料，尽量收集，分类集中，汇编为“中国农学遗产选集”的各个专辑；（3）编纂“中国古农书及有关图书总目提要”。现在，这三种工作都已开始进行。去年6月，中国农业科学院筹备组还特地召开了一次座谈会，讨论安排重印古农书的问题。半年多来，已由中华书局出版了十八种古农书和两种专辑。
    这些古农书的选择，大多数是取其比较重要而有代表性的，少数是利用原有纸型。这些书大都经过或多或少的加工。最起码的是各书都加了点句或新式标点。有些还作了汇校，补正书中的错字和脱文。有些还进一步地作了注释、考证和探讨。遗憾的是，有些古书的汇校、注释和考证等工作，不是短时间内所能做的，只得在可能范围内作了一些整理，或者只得暂据普通版本印行，以应急需。这只是一个开端，还有许多工作等待我们去做。
    现在把这二十种书分别简单介绍如下：
    1、“吕氏春秋上农等四篇校释”，战国末吕不韦等撰（公元前三世纪），夏纬英校释。我国在战国时代就有专门的农书，可惜都散失了，只保存下来一些鳞爪，其中较完整的是“吕氏春秋”中上农、任地、辩土、审时四篇。但是很难读。经过夏先生的校释，这四篇容易看懂了。夏先生的注释很谨严，除少数个别地方还待商讨外，基本上是正确的。
    2、“泛胜之书辑释”，汉泛胜之撰（公元前一世纪后半），万国鼎辑释。这是汉朝最有名的农书，原书早佚，但常为后世农书所引用。清代有三种辑佚本，不好。这本“辑释”除作了广泛的辑佚和汇校外，并详加考证、注释和探讨，特别注重农业技术问题。它同石声汉先生的“泛胜之书今释”（科学出版社出版）的体例和见解颇有出入，可以比照着看。
    3、“齐民要术”，后魏贾思勰撰（六世纪三十年代）。这是我国现存最古的完整农书，一向拥有很高的声誉。它有二十多种版本，都或多或少地有些缺点，而且内容广博，有些地方不容易看懂。我们正在进行较彻底的汇校、考证（包括实地调查）和注释，但是短时间内不能完成。现在只得暂照通行本印行。
    4、“陈旉农书”，宋陈旉撰（1149）。在古农书中，此书可为较多着重于理论性的代表。书中也确有经验之谈，特别是小小三卷书中有一卷说牛，很突出。唐宋时代农书大都散失了，这就更加显出此书的历史价值。书末附有宋楼璹的“耕织图诗”。
    5、“王祯农书”，元王祯撰
  （1313）。这是元朝的有名农书，前可同齐民要术，后可同农政全书媲美，农器图谱尤其是此书的特色。原书本作三十六集，清朝从永乐大典辑出，改作二十二卷。此书也需要加以汇校和整理。现在它的单行本很难买到，因此先利用现成纸型印出。
    6、“农政全书”，明徐光启撰（1628），陈子龙修订（1636），邹树文等汇校。这是我国个人编写的字数最多的古农书。作者徐光启很博学，对农事也有心得，自己在上海家乡有一个试验场。书中引用很多古书，但也到处表现出有他自己的见解。这书已有六种版本。我们特别组织了邹树文老先生等八人进行了仔细的汇校。
    7、“沈氏农书”，明末沈氏撰（十七世纪前半），清张履祥补（1658），陈恒力标点。此书亦称“补农书”。沈，湖州人，失名；张，桐乡人。所说主要是浙江湖州嘉兴一带的农事技术，篇幅虽小，但叙述扼要而又细致，很切实。
    8、“养余月令”，明戴羲撰（1640）。此书大抵采辑诸书而成。把农事按月排列，所以称为月令，但后面又以养鱼、竹、牡丹、芍药、兰、菊别出为卷。
    9、“授时通考”，清乾隆时官撰（1742）。这是清代采取多种古书资料编辑而成的，极少创见；但是把散见的资料汇编在一起，便于查阅，也有它的长处。
    10、“农学合编”，清杨巩撰（十九世纪末）。此书也是采辑诸书而成的，有些像授时通考，但比较粗糙。
    11、“花镜”，清陈淏子撰（1688），陈俊愉校勘。此书是讲花卉的；最后也附载畜养禽兽鱼介昆虫法，但以观赏为主。其中课花十八法是此书特色，很精到。
    12、“湖蚕述”，清汪日桢撰（1874）。
    13、“裨农最要”，清陈开沚撰（1897）。
    14、“蚕桑萃编”，清卫杰撰（1900）。
    这三种书是有代表性的清代蚕书。浙江湖州是我国有名的蚕区，“湖蚕述”详细记录了这一地区的养蚕技术。“裨农最要”是一个自己有养蚕经验的知识分子写的。“蚕桑萃编”是采辑群书而成的，幅篇最大。
    15、“司牧安骥集”，失名（九世纪？），谢成侠校勘标点。
    16、“元亨疗马集”，明喻本元、喻本亨撰（十六世纪），谢成侠、金重冶等校勘。
    这两种书是兽医专书，现存司牧安骥集五卷完整的，只有南京图书馆所藏明弘治重刊本一部，此次即据该本，由谢先生校订填补其中错字墨钉等排印。书前有刘豫阜昌五（1135）新刊校正序，可见成书至少在北宋以前。谢先生认为它是唐李石原著（九世纪前半），而经后人续有增订的。“元亨疗马集”是近四百年间普遍流传的书，至今仍是中兽医的经典；但一般版本很差，兹经仔细校勘，末附牛经和驼经。
    17、“农候杂占”，清梁章巨撰（1873）。此书主要为据物象预测农事上的丰歉吉凶，包括预测天气在内，但也杂有同农候无关的记载。其中有合理的，也有迷信的说法，特别需要用批判的态度去看它。
    18、“农雅”，清倪倬撰（1796）。此书可以说是一部农业辞典，收罗尚富，有参考价值。
    19、“中国农学遗产选集——稻（上编）”，中国农业遗产研究室陈祖椝编。
    20、“中国农学遗产选集——麦（上编）”，中国农业遗产研究室胡锡文编。
    这一套“选集”的性质，已如上述。稻和麦二专辑，是其中甲类第一种和第二种。一共要出多少专辑，现在还不能决定，不过总在一百种以上。这些专辑粗分为四类：甲类，植物各论；乙类，动物各论；丙类，农事技术；丁类，农业经济。现在正在用大量人力投入采辑各省地方志中有关农业的资料，这些资料将分别按地域次序编为各个专辑的下编。所以现在出版的稻麦二专辑，只有上编。上编里的资料，是按照年代先后排列的，每一资料都注明作者姓名和写作年代，并尽可能查对原书，必要时附加编者按语。又棉和柑橘二专辑的上编，也已经交稿付印。今年另有十几个专辑在编辑中。（万国鼎）
