Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The King of Iran, Pahlavi, appointed Eghbal as the new Prime Minister on April 3, replacing Ala, who resigned the previous day. The new Prime Minister was sworn in on the 4th.
Western news agencies reported that Ala's resignation was directly caused by the recent killing of three people, including American Point Four Program official Carroll, in southeastern Iran. Gregory, the head of the American Point Four Program in Iran, had threatened to partially suspend the program until the murderers were caught.

    伊朗首相易人
    据新华社讯　伊朗国王巴列维4月3日任命埃格巴尔为新首相，接替前一天辞职的阿拉。新首相已于4日就职。
    据西方通讯社报道，阿拉辞职的直接原因是最近在伊朗东南部发生的美国第四点计划官员卡罗尔等三人被杀事件。美国在伊朗的第四点计划负责人格里戈里曾经威胁说，在凶手被捕获以前，他将部分地停止第四点计划的执行。
