    "Communist Threat" is Nonsense
    Sudan Has No Intention of Joining the Baghdad Pact
    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, April 8th. Sudanese Foreign Minister Mahjoub refuted the notion of a so-called "Communist threat" in Sudan when he met with a reporter from the Egyptian "Al-Ahram" newspaper on April 7th.
    While stating that Sudan has no intention of joining the Baghdad Pact or any other military bloc, he said: "There is nothing between us and Iraq that requires us to join a defense treaty. If Iraq is afraid of Communism, then there is no such danger in our country."

    “共产主义威胁”是无稽之谈
    苏丹无意参加巴格达条约
    据新华社开罗8日电　苏丹外交部长马哈古卜4月7日在接见埃及“金字塔报”记者时驳斥了苏丹有所谓“共产主义威胁”的说法。
    他在声明苏丹没有参加巴格达条约或者其他任何军事集团的打算的时候说：“我们和伊拉克之间没有什么东西需要我们参加一项防务条约。如果伊拉克害怕共产主义，那末在我们的国家里，却没有这种危险。”
