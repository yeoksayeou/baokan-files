    Beijing Eggs Fly to Xinjiang
    The breeding chicken eggs produced by the Shuangqiao Farm in Beijing and the Baoding Livestock Farm are being transported to Xinjiang by the Civil Aviation Administration's planes for hatching.

    This airlifted batch of breeding chicken eggs totals 80,000, allocated by the Animal Husbandry Bureau of the Ministry of Land Reclamation to the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps for breeding the Leghorn superior chicken breed. Leghorn chickens produce large eggs in large quantities, with an average hen laying approximately 200 eggs per year, each egg weighing about three taels.

    北京鸡蛋飞到新疆
    北京双桥农场和保定畜牧场出产的种鸡卵正由民用航空局的飞机陆续运往新疆孵养。
    这次空运的种鸡卵共八万只，是由农垦部畜牧局调拨给新疆生产建设兵团繁殖的莱克亨优良鸡种。莱克亨鸡生产的卵颗很大，数量也多，平均每只鸡年产卵约二百只，每只卵约有三两重。
