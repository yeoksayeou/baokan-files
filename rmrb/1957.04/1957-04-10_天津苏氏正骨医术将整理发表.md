Xinhua News Agency report: The long-standing Tianjin Su's Bone-Setting Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine will be systematically organized.

More than two hundred years ago, Su Jiwei, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner in Tianjin, developed bone-setting medical skills. Passed down through generations, it is now in its sixth generation. Their excellent medical skills are well-known in Tianjin. Before Liberation, Tianjin storytellers even turned the superb bone-setting techniques of the third generation, Su Laoyi, into magical stories for performance.

The ancestral Su's bone-setting medical skills are most adept at treating severe traumatic injuries to muscles and bones. Yue Zhidai, a worker at the Tianjin No. 1 Flour Factory, once fell from the top of a three-story warehouse before Liberation, dislocating his left hip joint and driving his thigh bone into his lower abdomen; his right wrist and right scapula were also fractured; and several ribs were broken. He was unconscious at the time, and everyone thought that even if he didn't die, he would be disabled. The traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Su Xiaotang rushed to his rescue. In just ten days, the patient's pain subsided. After more than two months of treatment, Yue Zhidai's injuries were completely healed, and he is still working in the factory like everyone else. Su Baocheng, a doctor at the Xiaoguan Street Clinic, treated 4,106 orthopedic patients last year, of whom 90% have been cured.

The Su's ancestral bone-setting medical skills include various techniques such as touching, joining, positioning, and lifting. The Su's uncles and brothers each have their own specialties, and later split into many branches. Their medical experience has always been "passed down only to daughters-in-law, not to daughters." Uncles, brothers, and cousins do not exchange knowledge with each other. Now, encouraged by the government's policy on traditional Chinese medicine, sixteen Su's bone-setting doctors voluntarily formed a bone-setting organization and learning group last month, formulated a study plan, and are determined to systematically organize and exchange their bone-setting medical skills and publish them publicly. They are also preparing to strive to use scientific methods such as X-rays for clinical examination, and to record technical experiences with definite curative effects.

    天津苏氏正骨医术将整理发表
    据新华社讯　历史悠久的天津市中医苏氏正骨科医术，将被系统地整理出来。
    二百多年前，天津中医苏吉位研究出的正骨医术，经过代代相传，到现在已经是第六代了。他们精良的医术在天津很有名。解放前，天津市的说唱艺人，曾经把第三代苏老益高明的正骨手法编成神奇的故事加以演唱。
    祖传的苏氏正骨医术治疗严重的跌打损伤筋骨的病症最拿手，天津市第一面粉厂工人岳之岱解放前有一次从三层楼高的仓库顶上跌下来，左胯关节脱臼，腿骨插进了下腹部；右手腕骨和右肩胛骨都跌断了；肋骨也断了几根，当时昏迷不醒，别人都认为他不死也要残废。中医苏筱堂赶来急救，不过十天，病人便止住了疼痛。经过两个多月的治疗，岳之岱的跌伤完全好了，直到现在仍然在工厂里和别人一样的劳动。小关大街门诊部医生苏宝成，去年治疗了轻、重骨科患者四千一百零六名，其中有90％的人已被治愈。
    苏氏祖传的正骨医术有：摸、接、端、提等多种手法。苏氏叔伯弟兄都各有专长，后来分成好多宗支。他们的医术经验历来“只传媳妇，不传闺女”。伯叔、兄弟之间也不互相交流。现在，苏氏骨科医生十六人在政府中医政策的鼓舞下，于上月自愿组成了正骨整理学习小组，制定了学习计划，大家决心把自己的正骨医术有步骤地整理交流，公开发表。他们并且准备争取用爱克斯线等科学方法来进行临床检验，把有肯定疗效的技术经验记录下来。
