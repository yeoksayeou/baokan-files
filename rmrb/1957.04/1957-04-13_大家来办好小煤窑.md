Let's All Run Small Coal Mines Well
    Leng Cun
    The imbalance between coal supply and demand is a problem that many people have felt in production and life recently. The reason for this phenomenon is that after the development of national economic construction and the improvement of people's living standards, the demand for coal has greatly increased. Although the national coal industry has made great progress, it still cannot meet the needs of all parties. This is a difficulty in the course of progress.
    The state is very concerned about this issue. In addition to actively developing the production of state-owned and local state-owned coal enterprises and accelerating the construction of mines, the State Economic Commission recently decided to allocate a batch of special funds to local areas for the construction of small coal mines. The leading organs of Jilin, Liaoning, Hebei and other provinces have also decided to restore, improve and build a number of small coal mines this year. The benefits of opening small coal mines are: low investment, fast speed, and great effect. This will play a significant role in resolving the current contradiction between coal supply and demand.
    Opening small coal mines is a good way for people in various places, especially members of agricultural cooperatives, to help the country overcome the difficulty of insufficient coal supply and solve their own coal needs. It is hoped that agricultural cooperatives in areas with conditions for opening small coal mines will actively assist the government in doing this work well. Comrades working in various places should also actively lead the masses and rely on the masses to run small coal mines well. In this work, it is necessary to make overall plans based on local resources, local needs, and coal supply, and to do it in a planned and guided manner. We must not only care about immediate interests, open and dig indiscriminately, and develop blindly, nor should we only care about coal production and hinder agricultural production.

    大家来办好小煤窑

    煤炭供不应求，是近来不少人在生产和生活中感到的一个问题。造成这种现象的原因，是在国家经济建设发展和人民生活水平提高以后，煤炭需要数量大为增加，全国煤炭工业虽有很大发展，但是仍旧不能满足各方面的需要。这是前进中的一个困难。
    国家对这一问题十分关心。除了积极发展国营和地方国营煤炭企业的生产和加快矿井建设以外，国家经济委员会最近决定拨给地方一批专款，用来建设小煤窑。吉林、辽宁、河北等省的领导机关也决定在今年恢复、改进和新建一批小煤窑。开办小煤窑的好处是：投资少，速度快，效果大。这对解决目前煤炭供不应求的矛盾将起不小的作用。
    开办小煤窑，是各地人民群众，特别是农业合作社社员帮助国家克服煤炭供应不足的困难和解决自己煤炭需要的好办法。希望具备开办小煤窑条件的地区的农业合作社，积极协助政府作好这一工作。各地工作同志也应该积极领导群众和依靠群众把小煤窑办好。在这项工作中需要根据本地资源、当地需要和煤炭供应情况作通盘筹划，有计划有领导地去做。不能够只顾眼前利益，乱开乱挖，盲目发展，也不应该只管煤炭生产，妨害农业生产。
