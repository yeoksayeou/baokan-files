    The Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, at its meeting in Berlin, issued three important documents, pointing out the dangers that atomic weapons pose to humanity and calling on all the people of the world to demand an immediate halt to hydrogen bomb tests. These documents voice the common cry of the people of all countries and reflect the strong desire of the people of all countries for peace and against the threat of war.
    At present, the main direction of the efforts of the people of all countries to strive for peace is to achieve disarmament and ease international tensions. And in this effort, the primary step is to immediately stop the testing of atomic and hydrogen bombs in order to increase international trust and thus create favorable conditions for achieving disarmament and easing international tensions. This desire has recently been fully manifested in the increasingly widespread calls from people of all countries, especially the Japanese people, as well as governments, scientists, and political figures in many countries, for a halt to hydrogen bomb tests.
    Among the countries that possess atomic and hydrogen weapons, the Soviet Union has consistently advocated a complete ban on the use and testing of these weapons, and has repeatedly put forward reasonable proposals for the countries concerned to consider. Recently, at the meeting of the Subcommittee of the United Nations Disarmament Commission in London, in addition to proposing comprehensive disarmament proposals, the Soviet Union also advocated the conclusion of an agreement to temporarily suspend the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons. This attitude of the Soviet Union is the most powerful support for the demands and desires of the people of all countries to stop the testing of these weapons; at the same time, it also demonstrates the sincere willingness of the Soviet Union to open a path for negotiations on the issue of disarmament.
    However, the United States and Britain, using atomic and hydrogen weapons as the basis of their "policy of strength" and "deterrent force," are not only unwilling to agree to a complete ban on the use of these weapons, but are even unwilling to temporarily halt the testing of these weapons. In the Bermuda talks communique published on the 24th of last month, the heads of government of the United States and Britain openly stated that they "must continue to rely to a large extent on nuclear deterrence," and therefore, "it is necessary to continue effective nuclear testing." Precisely because of this, the representatives of the United States, Britain, and other Western countries refused to accept the Soviet Union's proposal on temporarily suspending atomic and hydrogen weapon tests at the London Disarmament Subcommittee meeting, so that no agreement was reached in the preliminary discussions on this issue.
    What does this stubborn attitude of the US and British governments show? This shows that they want to continue to create tension and obstruct the relaxation of the international situation in order to facilitate their continued pursuit of policies of aggression and arms expansion. Recently, in the activities of peddling the "Eisenhower Doctrine," the United States is making every effort to further infiltrate the countries of the Middle East and North Africa militarily and economically. The United States participates in the military committee of the Baghdad Pact, incites Israel to continue to be hostile to Arab countries, and carries out instigation activities in Arab countries, attempting to put pressure on Arab countries, undermine the unity of Arab countries, so as to force these countries to accept the "Eisenhower Doctrine" aggression plan that enslaves the Middle East. In Asia, the United States continues to be hostile to the Chinese people, and Dulles openly clamored at the Canberra meeting last month that the US forces in this region should possess atomic weapons. In Europe, the United States has promised to supply Britain with missiles, and has established or is establishing so-called atomic support command headquarters in some Western European countries. All these activities of the United States are using its so-called "deterrent force" as a means to further expand its influence everywhere and to tighten its control over some of its allies. Britain is trying to use the possession of hydrogen bombs as a "deterrent force" to maintain its precarious colonial rule and great power status.
    However, the development of the international situation is not determined by the subjective wishes of the imperialist countries, but by the will of the broad masses of people in all countries to strive for peace and defend national independence. The aggressive policy of the United States, especially its attempts to obstruct the relaxation of the international situation, has been met with increasingly widespread opposition from the people of all countries. This is manifested in the strong sentiments of the people of various Middle Eastern countries against the "Eisenhower Doctrine" and the US participation in the military committee of the Baghdad Pact, and it is even more clearly manifested in the powerful movement of the people of all countries demanding a halt to hydrogen bomb tests. The people of all countries take the demand to stop hydrogen bomb tests as the current important task, precisely in order to curb the US policy of arms expansion and war preparation, so as to promote the international situation towards relaxation.
    In this situation, the importance of the World Peace Council issuing a call to the world to demand a halt to hydrogen bomb tests and launching a movement against atomic and hydrogen bomb tests is obvious. In this movement, the people of all countries will further strengthen their unity and strength, thereby forming a huge public opinion pressure on the imperialist war groups. This will undoubtedly be another important development in the peace movement in recent years.
    The World Peace Council has a lofty prestige and great moral authority in the hearts of peace-loving people in all countries. The signature campaign for the Stockholm Appeal and the signature campaign for the conclusion of a peace pact by the five major powers that it launched in the past have been supported and endorsed by hundreds of millions of people around the world. We believe that this appeal and the movement launched by the World Peace Council will surely receive widespread support from the people of the world and achieve great success.

### 和平运动的重大步骤

    和平运动的重大步骤
    世界和平理事会常务委员会在柏林举行的会议，发表了三项重要的文件，指出原子武器给人类带来的危险，并呼吁全世界人民要求立即停止氢弹试验。这些文件发出了世界各国人民的共同呼声，反映了各国人民要求和平、反对战争威胁的强烈愿望。
    目前各国人民争取和平努力的主要方向，是要求实现裁减军备和缓和国际局势。而在这种努力中，首要的步骤是立即停止原子弹和氢弹的试验，以便增进国际间的信任，从而为实现裁减军备和缓和国际局势创造有利的条件。这种愿望，最近期间已由各国人民，特别是日本人民以及许多国家的政府、科学家、政界人士越来越广泛的要求停止氢弹试验的呼吁中充分表现了出来。
    在拥有原子武器和氢武器的国家中，苏联一向主张完全禁止使用和试验这些武器，并屡次提出合理的建议，要求有关国家考虑。最近在伦敦举行的联合国裁军委员会小组委员会的会议上，苏联除了提出全面的裁军建议之外，还主张缔结一项暂时中止试验原子武器和氢武器的协议。苏联的这种态度，是对各国人民要求停止试验这些武器和愿望的最有力的支持；同时这也表现了苏联希望为裁军问题的谈判打开一条出路的真诚意愿。
    但是，美英两国以原子武器和氢武器作为它们的“实力政策”和“威慑力量”的基础，它们不但不肯同意完全禁止使用这种武器，甚至不愿意暂时停止这种武器的试验。上月24日发表的百慕大会谈公报中，美英两国政府首脑就曾公开表示，它们“必须继续在很大程度上依靠原子核威慑力量”，因此，“继续进行有效的原子核试验是必要的”。正是由于这样，美英两国和其他西方国家的代表，在伦敦裁军小组委员会上拒绝接受苏联关于暂时停止原子武器和氢武器试验的建议，以致在这个问题的初步讨论中，没有达成任何协议。
    美英两国政府的这种顽固不化的态度说明了什么呢？这表明它们还要继续制造紧张局势，阻挠国际局势的缓和，以便利它们继续推行侵略和扩军备战的政策。最近美国在贩卖“艾森豪威尔主义”的活动中，正竭力进一步在军事和经济上渗入中东和北非国家。美国参加巴格达条约的军事委员会，怂恿以色列继续与阿拉伯国家为敌，并在阿拉伯国家中进行挑拨活动，企图给阿拉伯国家施加压力，破坏阿拉伯国家的团结，以便压迫这些国家接受奴役中东的“艾森豪威尔主义”侵略计划。在亚洲，美国继续与中国人民为敌，杜勒斯并在上月举行的堪培拉会议上公开叫嚷美国在这个地区的部队应拥有原子武器。在欧洲，美国已答应供给英国以导弹，并在一些西欧国家建立了或正在建立所谓原子支援司令部。美国所有这一切活动，都是以它的所谓“威慑力量”为手段，来进一步扩充它在各处的势力，并加紧控制它的一些盟国。英国则企图以拥有氢弹作为一种“威慑力量”，来保持它的摇摇欲坠的殖民统治和大国地位。
    可是国际局势的发展并不决定于帝国主义国家的主观愿望，而决定于各国广大人民争取和平和保卫民族独立的意志。美国的侵略政策，特别是它企图阻挠缓和国际局势的活动，遭到了各国人民日益广泛的反对。这表现在中东各国人民反对“艾森豪威尔主义”和美国参加巴格达条约军事委员会的强烈情绪上，也更清楚地表现在各国人民要求停止氢弹试验的强大运动中。各国人民把要求停止氢弹试验作为当前的重要任务，也正是为了要遏止美国的扩军备战政策，以便推动国际局势走向缓和。
    在这种情况下，世界和平理事会向全世界发出要求停止氢弹试验的呼吁，并发动一个反对原子弹和氢弹试验的运动，其重要性是显而易见的。各国人民将在这个运动中进一步加强他们的团结和力量，从而形成对帝国主义战争集团的一种巨大的舆论压力。这无疑将是近年来和平运动的又一个重要的发展。
    世界和平理事会在各国爱好和平的人民的心目中，有着崇高的威信和极大的道义权威。它过去发动的斯德哥尔摩宣言的签名运动以及五大国缔结和平公约的签名运动，曾得到全世界亿万人民的支持和拥护。我们相信，世界和平理事会的这次呼吁和发起的运动，必将同样获得世界人民的广泛支持，并取得伟大的成就。
