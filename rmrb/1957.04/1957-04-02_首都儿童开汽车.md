    Capital Children Drive Cars
    On March 31st, the First Ministry of Machine Building gifted a "Shaonian Xianfeng (Young Pioneers)" brand Jiefang (Liberation) truck to the children of Beijing, for the purpose of studying the principles of automobile construction and learning to drive.
    More than a thousand children participated in the gifting ceremony held at the Beihai Children's Palace. Li Liguo, Vice Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building, read the gifting letter, encouraging the children to study hard and race with the Jiefang truck. Then, Zhu Xiaohui, a fifteen-year-old young driver and member of the Children's Palace's automobile group, got into the driver's seat and steadily drove the car into the Children's Palace's stadium.
    Many units in the capital are very concerned about the extracurricular education of children. The First Ministry of Machine Building will also send an internal combustion engine and several small lathes for the children to use. The Ministry of Transportation and the Second Ministry of Machine Building have respectively sent the Beihai Children's Palace a "Shaonian Xianfeng (Young Pioneers)" jet-propelled tugboat and a complete set of telecommunications and radio equipment. The Ministry of Electric Power Industry has also established a "Young Pioneers Hydroelectric Power Station" in Beihai Park for the children of the capital.

    首都儿童开汽车
    第一机械工业部31日将一辆命名为“少年先锋号”的解放牌汽车赠送给北京市少年儿童，作为儿童们研究汽车构造原理和学习驾驶之用。
    一千多个儿童参加了在北海少年之家举行的赠送仪式。第一机械工业部副部长李力果宣读了赠送书，勉励儿童们要好好学习，和解放牌汽车赛跑。接着少年之家汽车组组员——十五岁的小司机朱小慧走进驾驶室，稳稳地把汽车开进了少年之家的体育场。
    首都许多单位对孩子们的校外教育非常关怀。第一机械工业部还将再送一部汽车内燃机和若干小车床给儿童们使用。交通部、第二机械工业部已分别送给北海少年之家一艘“少年先锋号”喷水拖轮和成套的电信、无线电设备。电力工业部也为首都的儿童们在北海公园建立了“少先队水力发电站”。
