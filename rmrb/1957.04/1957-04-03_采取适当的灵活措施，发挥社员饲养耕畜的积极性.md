　　Adopt appropriate flexible measures to stimulate the enthusiasm of commune members in raising draught animals

Editor's Note: The March 19th instruction of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on the issue of draught animals pointed out a series of measures to change the serious unfavorable situation in the development of draught animals. One of these measures is to improve the utilization and feeding management of draught animals. To do this work well, the most important thing is to enhance the sense of responsibility and enthusiasm of the users and feeders for protecting draught animals. How can this goal be achieved? The instruction pointed out: "Each cooperative can be allowed to have a certain degree of autonomy in this regard, based on the specific conditions of the cooperative, to adopt appropriate flexible measures to stimulate the enthusiasm of commune members in raising draught animals. It is not appropriate to rigidly prescribe the methods in a uniform manner." Many agricultural cooperatives in various places have adopted different methods of using and raising draught animals according to the specific conditions of their own cooperatives. Facts have already proven that these methods are applicable and effective under the current conditions in their respective localities. The experiences of some cooperatives published here can be used as a reference for cooperatives in various places.

　　采取适当的灵活措施，发挥社员饲养耕畜的积极性
    编者按　中共中央和国务院3月19日关于耕畜问题的指示中，指出了改变耕畜发展方面的严重不利情况的一系列办法。其中办法之一是改善耕畜的役使和饲养管理工作。要做好这项工作，最重要的是提高使用人员和饲养人员对于保护耕畜的责任心和积极性。怎样才能达到这个目的呢？指示中指出：“可以容许各合作社在这方面有根据本社具体情况、采取适当的灵活措施的一定自治权，以利发挥社员饲养耕畜的积极性，不宜千篇一律地把办法规定得太死。”各地不少农业社已经根据本社情况采取了一些不同的使用和饲养耕畜的办法，事实已经证明了这些办法在当地目前的条件下是适用的，有效的。这里发表的一些社的经验，可供各地各社参考。
