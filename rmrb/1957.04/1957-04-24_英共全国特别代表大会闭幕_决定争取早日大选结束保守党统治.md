    British Communist Party Special National Congress Concludes
    Decides to Strive for Early General Election to End Conservative Rule
    (Our Dispatch from London, April 23rd) The 25th Special National Congress of the British Communist Party successfully concluded on the afternoon of the 22nd.
    Comrade Pollitt's closing remarks were met with continuous applause from the delegates. When he mentioned the necessity of strengthening the internationalist unity of the international working class, and particularly emphasized the enormous contributions made by the Soviet people, the Soviet government, and the Soviet Party to all mankind and to the cause of the international working class, the delegates responded with warm applause.
    The meeting on the 22nd announced the election results of the new central organs. Pollitt, Gallacher, Dutt, Gollan, Matthews, and others were all re-elected as members of the Central Executive Committee.
    This congress unfolded debates on various important issues. Especially during the final day's meeting, intense debate took place regarding the issue of inner-party democracy. Many delegates spoke to refute the viewpoints of the minority faction. They pointed out that any proposition that attempts to weaken or eliminate democratic centralism is a revisionist ideology, which is also a bourgeois ideology; if the congress were to accept the minority faction's opinions on the issue of inner-party democracy, the result would inevitably be the weakening of the party's combat effectiveness, leading to the party's division. During the vote, the congress overwhelmingly passed the majority faction's report on the issue of inner-party democracy by a margin of fifty to one. Thus, the three documents submitted to the congress by the Central Committee of the British Communist Party (the other two documents being the "Political Resolution" and the revised version of "Britain's Road to Socialism") have all been adopted by the congress.
    The outcome of the congress marks the further unity and consolidation of the entire British Communist Party.
    The voting on the three documents took place separately on the 20th, 21st, and 22nd. During the process of the congress, the truth became clearer as the debate continued, and the more it progressed, the more delegates voted in favor during the votes. One delegate said in his speech that he originally supported the views of the minority faction, but during the congress, he changed his viewpoint and realized that the opinions of the majority faction were correct.
    With the successful conclusion of this congress, the debate that had been going on within the party for a year came to an end. A common theme in the speeches of many delegates before the congress concluded was: to demand that the party quickly turn its attention to the mass movement, lead the British people to strengthen their struggle, strive for an early general election, and defeat the Conservative government. "End Conservative rule!" This was the most prominent slogan in the congress venue. The deep impression the congress gave people was: in the future political life of Britain, the British Communist Party will play an increasingly significant role.

    英共全国特别代表大会闭幕
    决定争取早日大选结束保守党统治
    本报伦敦23日电　英共第二十五届全国特别代表大会，已经在22日下午胜利闭幕。
    波立特同志的闭幕词，不断地赢得代表们的鼓掌。当他提到必须加强国际工人阶级的国际主义团结，并特别强调了苏联人民、苏联政府、苏联党对全人类、对国际工人阶级事业所作的巨大贡献时，代表们报以热烈的掌声。
    22日的会议，宣布了新的中央机构的选举结果。波立特、加拉赫、杜德、高兰、马修斯等，均继续当选为中央执行委员。
    这次代表大会，在各个重大问题上，都展开了辩论。特别是最后一天的会议中，在关于党内民主问题上进行了激烈的争论。许多代表发言批驳少数派的观点。他们指出，凡是企图削弱或取消民主集中制的主张，都是修正主义思想，也就是资产阶级思想；代表大会如果接受了少数派关于党内民主问题的意见，结果必然是削弱党的战斗力，导向党的分裂。代表大会在表决时以五十比一的压倒多数通过了多数派关于党内民主问题的报告。这样，由英共中央提交大会的三个文件（其他两个文件是“政治决议”和“英国走向社会主义的道路”修改本）已为代表大会所全部通过。
    代表大会的结果，标志着英共全党的进一步团结和巩固。
    三个文件的表决，是分别在20日、21日和22日进行的。在大会进行过程中，真理愈辩愈明，愈到后来，表决时投赞成票的也愈多。有个代表在发言中说，他原来是赞成少数派的主张的，但是在大会期间，他改变了自己的观点，认识到多数派的意见是正确的。
    随着这次代表大会的胜利闭幕，在党内进行了达一年之久的争论遂告结束。许多代表在大会闭幕前发言的一个共同点是：要求党迅速地把注意力转向群众运动上，领导英国人民加强斗争、争取早日举行大选并击败保守党政府。“结束保守党的统治！”这是大会会场上最显著的一条标语。大会给予人们的深刻印象是：在未来的英国政治生活中，英国共产党将起愈来愈显著的作用。
