    China Association for Promoting Democracy Central Standing Committee
    Determines Current Top Political Task

    (From Our Newspaper) On April 9th, the Central Standing Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy issued a "Notice on Studying and Implementing the Spirit of the Resolutions of the Third Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference" to its provincial and municipal committees and preparatory committees, and the central directly affiliated branches.

    The notice first stated: The Third Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference fully demonstrates the significant role that the CPPCC plays in the political life of our people. The important reports, speeches, and resolutions of the meeting will greatly promote the smoother progress of our country's socialist cause. In particular, prior to this meeting, Chairman Mao's speech at the enlarged Supreme State Conference on "Correctly Handling Contradictions Among the People" is a development of Marxism-Leninism and has major guiding significance for our country's socialist construction and the political life of the people throughout the country.

    The notice called on all levels of organizations and all members of the China Association for Promoting Democracy to deeply and conscientiously study Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference and the important documents of this CPPCC meeting, and to implement their spirit into future work and actions.

    The notice stated: Contradictions among the people are different in nature from contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, and therefore the methods of resolving contradictions are also different. In dealing with contradictions among the people, we must resolutely implement the principle of "starting from the desire for unity, going through criticism and struggle, and achieving new unity on a new basis." As a democratic party serving socialism, the China Association for Promoting Democracy must implement the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," and assist the Party and the government in playing an active role in handling contradictions among the people.

    The notice pointed out: Intellectuals serve the people, which is to serve the workers and peasants, and are teachers who educate the people. Educators must first be educated themselves. Therefore, it is extremely important for intellectuals to strengthen ideological remolding. All levels of organizations of the China Association for Promoting Democracy must strengthen political and ideological education, help members conscientiously study Marxist-Leninist theory and national policies, directly contact the workers and peasants, learn from the workers and peasants, in order to strengthen ideological remolding. At the same time, it is necessary to help members correctly understand the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," dispel concerns, speak freely, distinguish right from wrong, uphold the truth, help each other, and strengthen unity.

    The notice also called on all levels of organizations and all members to actively participate in the movement to increase production and practice economy.

    The notice concluded: Studying Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference is the top political task of the China Association for Promoting Democracy at present. It is hoped that leading comrades at all levels will first conscientiously take the lead in studying, and, based on the specific circumstances, closely contact and cooperate with the United Front Work Department of the local CCP Committee and the local CPPCC committee to mobilize and help members and the masses they are in contact with to study conscientiously.
