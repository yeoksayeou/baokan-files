    Combine Management and Use of Draught Animals
    Zhang Xiuqun
    The Qianjin First Agricultural Cooperative in Wugong County, Shaanxi Province, has seventy-two large livestock, each fed until they are round and fat. Old horses and cattle over ten years old are still very effective to use, and all fourteen female animals have given birth to lively young. This cooperative was recently rated as a model livestock breeding and management cooperative of Grade A in the county.
    Why are the livestock in this cooperative managed so well? The main reason is that the feeders combine "management" and "use." The cooperative gives the feeders certain powers to manage the livestock. Anyone who wants to use livestock must first inform the feeder, who allocates them according to their purpose, preventing members from arbitrarily choosing the largest or fastest animals to use. Although the production team leader directs the use of livestock in the fields, a system for handing over livestock is also stipulated. If the feeder discovers that the livestock has been injured, they can refuse to return them to the pen, and the person using the livestock is responsible for treatment.
    Usually, the feeders manage the livestock very well. Whether early or late, when you enter the feeding room, the pen is always dry and level, and there is no difference in the humidity of the fodder in the corners and the center of the trough. In winter, the rafters and windows are well sealed, and the livestock can even drink warm water.
    Exploring and researching how to manage livestock well has become almost as habitual for the feeders as eating and sleeping. They study the patterns of estrus and pregnancy in each type of livestock and devise various methods for mating each female animal.
    Currently, all fourteen feeders in the cooperative are basically ideologically sound, meticulous in their work, and experienced in feeding livestock. The cooperative has always attached great importance to the remuneration of the feeders. After transitioning to a higher-level cooperative last spring, a method of paying for livestock quota management was implemented. It was determined that each feeder would feed six livestock, accumulate seven large carts of manure per livestock per month, and record thirty work points, with each feeder earning two hundred and sixteen workdays per year. However, during the summer harvest distribution, the remuneration of the feeders was not even as good as the best labor force in the cooperative, which affected the work enthusiasm of some feeders. After the management committee discovered this problem, it corrected it in a timely manner. However, some members gossiped behind their backs. After the management committee heard about the gossip, it promptly calculated the details for the members and explained: Earning the highest workdays is certainly not easy, but participating in field labor means you can sleep as soon as it gets dark, and you don't have to work on rainy days. Feeders, on the other hand, are the same whether it's sunny or dark, rain or shine, 360 days a year; besides, without livestock plowing the land, how can crops grow? As long as the feeders are enthusiastic, reducing livestock deaths by one and increasing the breeding of one young animal, how much more production will that increase? Taking more care of the feeders is beneficial to everyone! After the explanation, the members who were gossiping had no more objections. And the feeders' enthusiasm was much greater, pushing carts and carrying baskets, picking up every bit of livestock manure lost on the roads and in the fields.
    Everyone also takes good care of the feeders' lives. Some members help the feeders cut green grass on rainy days, and when the livestock pen lacks soil on rainy days, the members help the feeders transport soil in the rain. Last year, during the Wugong County river beach fair in December, the cooperative even coordinated manpower to allow the feeders to take turns attending the fair. During festivals, cooperative cadres always take the time to chat with the feeders and share a couple of drinks. This has deeply affected the feeders.

### 把管理和使用耕畜结合起来

    把管理和使用耕畜结合起来
    张秀群
    陕西省武功县前进第一农业社有七十二个大牲畜，一个个喂得滚肚肥圆，十多岁口的老马老牛，使用起来还很得劲，十四头母畜都已生下了活蹦乱跳的幼畜。这个社最近被评为全县甲等牲口饲养管理模范社。
    为啥这个社的牲口管得这样好呢？主要原因是饲养员把“管”和“使”结合起来了。社里给了饲养员一定的管理牲口的权力，谁家要用牲口，得先向饲养员打招呼，饲养员就根据用途调配，不让社员任意挑大的或快的使用。田间使用牲口虽由生产队长支配，但同时也规定了交接牲口制度，饲养员发现牲口有被打伤等情形，可以拒绝归槽，由使用牲口的人负责治疗。
    平素饲养员们把牲口管理得也很好。迟早走进饲养室，圈内总是又干又平的，槽角和槽中心的饲草湿度丝毫找不出差别来。冬天，椽眼和门窗都堵得好好的，牲口还能喝上温水。
    探讨研究怎样管好牲口，对饲养员们来说，几乎和吃饭睡觉一样地习惯了。他们研究每一种牲口发情和怀孕的规律，并且想出各种办法给每一头母畜配种。
    现在全社十四个饲养员，基本上都是思想好、工作细心、有喂牲口经验的。社里对饲养员的劳动报酬，一贯也是很重视的。去春转为高级社后，试行了牲口定额管理付酬办法。确定每个饲养员喂六个牲口，每个牲口每月积七大车粪、记三十分工，全年每个饲养员可得二百一十六个劳动日。但是在夏收分配的时候，饲养员的劳动报酬还赶不上社内最好的劳动力，影响了一些饲养员的工作情绪。管委会发现这个问题后，及时纠正了。可是有些社员却在背后说风凉话。管委会听到有人在背后议论，及时对社员算了细账，作了解释：挣最高劳动日固然不容易，但是参加田间劳动，刚一黑就可以睡觉，下雨天也不做活了。饲养员呢，一年三百六十天，黑黑明明、天阴下雨都一个样；再说社里没有牲口整地，庄稼怎能长得上来？只要饲养员情绪高，少死一个牲口，多繁殖一个幼畜，该要增产多少？多照顾饲养员，对大家都是有好处的哩！在背后议论的社员经过解释后也没有意见了。而饲养员的干劲可大得多了，推着土车担着笼，把遗失在大路上和地里的牲口粪，拾了个干干净净。
    大家对饲养员的生活照顾得也很周到。有些社员下雨天帮助饲养员割青草，淋雨天牲口圈缺土时，社员们就冒雨帮饲养员运土。去年腊月武功县举行河滩会，社里还调剂人力让饲养员轮流去赶会。逢年逢节，社干部总要抽空和饲养员谈谈心，端菜摆酒喝上两盅的。这对饲养员感受极深。
