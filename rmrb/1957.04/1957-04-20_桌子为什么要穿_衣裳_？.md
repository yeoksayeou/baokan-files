    Why Should Tables Wear "Clothes"?
    Lin Xi
    Due to the nature of my work, I often attend meetings held by various departments. In my memory, the tables in the meeting rooms of government offices are almost always covered with snow-white tablecloths. In government offices, in many friends' homes, and in the dining cars of trains and ships, the tables, even if they are beautifully lacquered, are also covered with tablecloths. I admit that having a tablecloth is more aesthetically pleasing than not having one, but given the current limited production of cotton cloth in our country, I wonder, why should tables wear "clothes"?
    This is a waste that cannot be ignored. At a national meeting of bureau directors held by one department, I carefully calculated: there were twenty-two conference tables, each three feet wide and fourteen feet long, all covered with tablecloths. Assuming each table uses sixteen feet of cloth in length and four feet four inches (i.e., two widths) in width, that's thirty-two feet of cloth per table. Thirty-two (feet of cloth) multiplied by twenty-two (tables) equals how much? Seven hundred and four feet of cloth. This cloth could be used to make forty-four adult uniforms (assuming sixteen feet per uniform). And how many tables across the country are covered with tablecloths?
    Some say that tablecloths are used to protect the table surface and maintain hygiene, especially on dining tables where tablecloths make it easier to clean up crumbs and leftover food. This makes some sense. However, a table won't be worn out in just three to five years, while a tablecloth may only last for three to five years. Therefore, comparing the depreciation of a table with the cost of a tablecloth, it is clear that the tablecloth represents a much higher value.
    If it is said that meetings cannot be held well and meals cannot be enjoyed without tablecloths, then I agree with using them. But if it is said that not using tablecloths does not affect meetings or meals, then I suggest not using them for the time being (of course, government offices and individuals who already have tablecloths can continue to use them; but do not make any more for the time being)! Because the people of our country are not yet very well-off in terms of clothing, why rush to dress up the tables first?

### 桌子为什么要穿“衣裳”？

    桌子为什么要穿“衣裳”？
    林晰
    由于工作的关系，我经常参加一些部门召开的会议。在我的记忆里，机关会议室的桌子总有十之八九铺上了雪白的台布；在机关里，在许多朋友家里，在火车、轮船的餐厅里，桌子原来油漆得很漂亮，也都铺上了台布。我承认，有台布比没有台布要美观一些，但是在我国目前棉布生产还不很充裕的情况下，我想，桌子为什么要穿“衣裳”呢？
    这是一个不可忽视的浪费。在一个部门召开的全国厅、局长会议上，我注意计算了一下：那里有二十二张宽三尺、长一丈四尺的会议桌，桌子全铺上了台布。按每张桌子用布长十六尺、宽四尺四寸（即两幅）计算，即用布三十二尺。三十二（尺布）乘二十二（个桌子）等于多少呢？七百零四尺布。这些布用来做衣服，可做成年人的制服四十四套（每套按一丈六尺计算）。而全国又有多少个桌子铺上了台布？
    有人说：铺台布是为了保护桌面，保持卫生，特别是餐桌上铺台布容易打扫残屑剩饭。这有一定的道理。但是一张桌子毕竟不是三、五年就能用得坏的，而一块台布不过只能用三几年。因此，把一张桌子的损耗折旧和台布相比较，显然是台布付出的价值高得多。
    如果说，桌子不铺台布，会议就开不好，饭也吃不香，那么我赞成铺上；如果说，不铺台布不至于影响开会和吃饭，那么，我建议还是暂时不铺吧（当然，机关、个人已有台布的，也还可以使用；但目前不要再添制了）！因为我国人民目前在衣着上还不是十分富裕，何必先忙着给桌子穿上“衣裳”？
