    Over Two Hundred Types of Minerals Discovered in Fujian

    Thirteen exploration teams are currently searching for coal, iron, and other mineral resources in the deep mountains and valleys of Fujian Province.

    This year, Fujian Province's exploration workload has increased more than twofold compared to last year. In addition to focusing on exploring iron and coal mines in Longyan, Zhangping, Anxi, Dehua, Datian, Liancheng, Yongchun, and other counties, a general survey of lead-zinc mines, limestone, manganese, tungsten, crystal, mica, and other minerals will also be conducted in more than ten counties.

    Relevant department负责人 (fùzé rén, person in charge) said that according to mass reports and survey materials over the past few years, more than two hundred types of metallic and non-metallic minerals have now been discovered.

    福建发现矿产两百多种
    十三个勘探队目前正在福建省深山峡谷中寻找煤、铁等矿产资源。
    今年福建省勘探的工作量比去年增加两倍多，除了在龙岩、漳平、安溪、德化、大田、连城、永春等县重点勘探铁、煤矿以外，还要在十多个县境内普查铅锌矿、石灰石、锰、钨、水晶、云母等矿。
    有关部门负责人说，根据几年来群众报矿和普查材料，现已发现的金属和非金属矿产有两百多种。
