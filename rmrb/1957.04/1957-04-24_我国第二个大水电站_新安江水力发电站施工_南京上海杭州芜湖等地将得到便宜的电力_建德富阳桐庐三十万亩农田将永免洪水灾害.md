Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The main works of China's current second largest hydropower station, the Xin'an River Hydropower Station, the dam head and the general hub switch station for external power transmission, started construction successively on April 1st and 15th.

Currently, more than 10,000 employees on the construction site are working day and night in three shifts. The eighteen bridge piers of the Sujiang Bridge, a key project on the Lanxi-Tongguan Railway line, with a total length of more than 550 meters, have all emerged above the water surface before the spring flood season; after the railway opens to traffic in the third quarter, the main materials and machinery needed for underwater construction can be continuously transported to the construction site. The Huangtankou Hydropower Station, which is under construction, will also strive to have one generating unit start generating electricity in the fourth quarter of this year to supply power to the Xin'an River Hydropower Station project.

This large-scale hydropower station was designed by Chinese engineering and technical personnel with the help of Soviet experts.

The Xin'an River Hydropower Station has an installed capacity of 580,000 kilowatts, which is larger than China's current largest Xiaofengman Hydropower Station. It will generate an average of 1.8 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, supplying Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Wuhu and other places. In the future, as long as the river channels upstream and downstream of the Xin'an River are slightly renovated, ships of about 100 tons can pass through; the three cities of Jiande, Fuyang, and Tonglu, as well as 300,000 mu of farmland, will never suffer from flood disasters again.

Where will the electricity from the Xin'an River Hydropower Station be sent?

    我国第二个大水电站
    新安江水力发电站施工
    南京上海杭州芜湖等地将得到便宜的电力
    建德富阳桐庐三十万亩农田将永免洪水灾害
    据新华社讯　我国目前第二个大水电站——新安江水力发电站的主体工程中的拦河坝头和对外输电的总枢纽开关站，先后在4月1日和15日开工。
    现在，工地上一万多名职工分三班正在日夜施工。兰（溪）铜（官）铁路线上的关键工程全长五百五十多公尺的苏江大桥的十八个桥墩，已经在春汛前全部露出水面；第三季度铁路通车以后，水面施工时需要的主要物资和机械，便能源源运达工地。正在建设中的黄坛口水力发电站也争取在今年第四季度有一台机组开始发电，给新安江水电站工程送电。
    这座大型水力发电站是由我国工程技术人员在苏联专家的帮助下，设计的。
    新安江水电站装机容量达五十八万瓩，比我国现在最大的小丰满水力发电站还要大，平均每年将发出十八亿度电力，供应南京、上海、杭州、芜湖等地。将来新安江上、下游的河道只要稍加整治，便能通行一百吨左右的船只；建德、富阳、桐庐三个城市和三十万亩农田，也将永远不会遭受洪水灾害。（附图片）
    新安江水电站的电将送到哪里去？
