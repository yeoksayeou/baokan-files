    Early Morning
    Wang Kai
    Whoosh—whoosh—whoosh, the sound of a conch shell disturbed the early morning tranquility of the island.
    In a small stone house deep in the dense forest, a faint yellow light shone through the window paper. The silhouette of a head with two thick braids was projected onto the paper. Huanzi, the girl, was getting up.
    She glanced at her mother, who was lying beside her, fast asleep: her mouth slightly open, breathing with a snoring sound; her closed eyes were a little swollen; a shiny speck was visible in the corner of her left eye, a trace of dried tears. "She must be crying about her brother in her dreams again," Huanzi thought. Ever since the Chiang Kai-shek troops fled, taking her brother with them, her mother had been constantly crying and talking about him, even suddenly bursting into tears while cooking or sleeping. Huanzi was already used to this. She buttoned her jacket and quietly walked out.
    "Clang—lang!"
    Something clanged, startling the rooster in the henhouse, which stretched its neck and crowed.
    "Huanzi! What are you doing, making the chickens and dogs bark!" Her mother woke up, her eyes opening, then closing again, dazzled by the lamplight. She felt that her daughter's bed was empty, became angry, rubbed her eyes, and said, "Are you not going to let anyone sleep! Aiyah!"
    "Mom, didn't you hear the conch shell? They're about to unload the ship!" Huanzi carried an iron shovel and a straw basket out of the shed: "It's dark and gloomy in the shed, I knocked over the shovel!"
    "It's not even the New Year, why get up so early!"
    Her mother grumbled unhappily. But she yawned and sat up too. She knew that Huanzi was going to the dock to unload cement or fine sand.
    The island was building defense works, and the fishermen had voluntarily organized themselves to help their army. The young people went to the seaside to unload ships; the old people crushed rocks at the foot of the mountain. Vehicles and ships came and went all day long. People sang fishermen's songs and bustled about happily. And her daughter was always one of the first to run ahead.
    She walked outside and looked up: the Milky Way stretching across the sky was already blurred, but in the distant sky, there were still many scattered stars, faintly peering at the sea. The weather was so muggy that it was hard to breathe. It was the beginning of the seventh month of the lunar calendar.
    "It's not even dawn yet!"
    "The conch shell has already been blown," Huanzi said, tying the ropes on the basket in the yard.
    "You just have sharp ears!"
    Her mother went back into the house, put the oil lamp on the stove, used a wooden ladle to add water to the pot, and then picked up a bundle of dry sorghum leaves to hold to the flame of the oil lamp. Just then, she saw her daughter run into the house, wrap some dry food in a handkerchief, and walk outside.
    "Where are you going?" She stopped her daughter: "I've already added the water, wouldn't it be late if you drink some porridge first? You're not a cadre, no one will point their finger at you."
    Huanzi, upon hearing this, didn't argue but didn't listen either, just smiled at her mother, flicked her braids, and walked away.
    This made her mother angry, and she raised her voice and shouted, "Come back here! See if I can't control you, you little black star! A big girl of eighteen or nineteen, no proper standing or sitting posture; what do you look like?" She paused and changed to a gentler tone, "It's just being active! But even being active doesn't mean you don't eat. Being a model worker is not easy!" But Huanzi had already gone far away. She suddenly sat down on the bench, the dry sorghum leaves fell from her hand and scattered all over the ground, and she hugged her left knee in anger.
    The little Qing girl from the neighbor's house came running over, carrying an iron shovel, shouting from afar: "Huanzi! Huanzi!"
    "Dead!" Her mother's hoarse voice shouted impatiently: "Calling souls again! Calling souls again!"
    Little Qing girl heard the voice, stuck out her tongue, and ran towards the pier. Not far away, a black shadow flashed and then hugged her. She felt two rather thick braids hitting her face, and she knew it was her friend Huanzi waiting for her there. ...
    Her mother sulked for a while, and finally smiled again. "If I can't control her, I won't bother." She remembered that today the old women were going to crush rocks at the foot of the mountain, took her hammer, locked the door, and left. She was always like this, as long as Huanzi refused to eat, she didn't want to eat either.
    The early morning of the island in July is particularly refreshing. The white poplar trees along the road stood tall and silent. The crops in the terraced fields drooped their heads, shyly peeking at the passersby like unmarried girls.
    The sun had not yet appeared. A gentle breeze blew, and the clouds sped by. Suddenly, a few drops of rain fell on the ground. Soon, the scattered raindrops connected into fine lines. The mountain path was wet.
    Sweat broke out on her forehead as she climbed to the top of the first mountain. Huanzi's mother casually tucked a strand of hair that had fallen on her cheek behind her ear. She could see clearly that there were many black dots wriggling in the rock crushing yard over there, and she was not the earliest one there. The pier was even more lively: young men and women were carrying things off the transport ships. The sound of laughter and talk carried over on the wind. Although she couldn't recognize which one was her daughter, she felt that Huanzi was among those laughing people, and felt a burst of joy in her heart. Suddenly, her nose felt a pang of soreness again, and she almost shed tears. She thought that if Huanzi's brother were here, with his great strength, no young man could compare to him in terms of work! But... they really had to build the island into an iron one, so that the bad guys wouldn't dare to come near the island again. ...
    Suddenly a voice rang in her ear:
    "Huanzi's mother, you've come so early!"
    She waved the small hammer in her hand and smiled at her old friends: "Let's have a competition!"

    清早
    王恺
    呜—呜—呜，一阵海螺的声音，扰乱了海岛清早的寂静。
    密林深处三间石头砌成的小屋里，窗纸透出了淡黄色的光亮。有个拖着两条粗辫子的头影映在窗纸上。换子姑娘起床了。
    她朝躺在自己身旁的妈妈望一眼，妈妈睡得正浓：半张着嘴，呼噜呼噜地喘着气；闭起的眼睛有点发肿；左眼角上看得见有一颗发亮的东西，是泪水凝固了的痕迹。“八成又是做梦想哥哥哭了。”换子心里想。自打蒋军逃窜时带走哥哥以来，妈妈总是时刻哭眼抹泪地念叨，就是在做饭或睡觉时，都会突然地哭出声来。这对于换子已是很习惯的了。她一边扣着小褂的扭扣，一边轻轻地走出门去。
    “噹——郎！”
    不知甚么响了一声，鸡窝里的大公鸡被惊醒了，它直起脖子咯咯地叫了起来。
    “换子！是怎么弄的鸡鸣狗叫的！”妈妈也醒来了，眼一睁开让灯火耀得重又闭起，一摸女儿的被窝是空着的，就生了气，揉揉眼睛说：“你是不打算让人睡觉啦！咹！”
    “妈，没听见吹海螺？就要卸船了！”换子提着一张铁锨和一个草筐从草棚里走了出来：“草棚里黑古隆冬的，铁锨给我弄倒了！”
    “又不过年，起甚么五更！”
    妈妈没好气的咕噜着。但她打个呵欠也坐起来了。她知道换子要到码头上卸洋灰或是卸细砂去。
    岛子上正在修建国防工事，渔民都自动组织起来援助自己的军队。年青的到海边卸船；年老的在山下碎石。整日车辆船只来往不断。人们唱着渔家歌谣，欢欢乐乐地忙碌着。而她的女儿总是跑在前面的一个。
    她走到门外，仰头一看：横在当头的银河已模糊不清了，但在远远的天边，还有不少零散的星辰，依稀窥视着大海。天气闷热得使人喘不过气来。这正是阴历七月初头。
    “天还没亮呢！”
    “海螺可吹过了。”换子在院子里结筐上的绳子。
    “就你耳朵尖！”
    妈妈回到房里，把油灯端在锅台上，用木瓢往锅里添水，然后又拿起一束干高粱叶子凑到油灯的火苗上去。就在这时，她看到女儿跑进房来，用块手帕包点干粮就朝外走。
    “你到哪儿去？”她拦住女儿：“水都添好了，喝点稀饭再去就晚啦？你又不是干部，没人指你的后脊梁。”
    换子姑娘听了，不辩论但也不肯听从，只是笑着望妈妈一眼，一甩辫子走了。
    这下可把妈妈惹恼了，她提高嗓子喊：“给我回来！看我管不了你个黑女星！十八、九的大姑娘，站没站相，坐没坐相；成个什么样子？”她顿一顿又改换了另一种和缓的口气说：“就是个积极！可积极也不能不吃饭。那模范是容易当的啊！”但换子早已走远了。她猛然坐到板凳上，干高粱叶子从她手中落下来撒了满地，她双手抱住左膝在生气。
    东邻家的小青姑娘这时扛着铁锨跑来了，老远就朝这儿喊：“换子！换子！”
    “死啦！”妈妈沙哑的嗓子没好气地喊：“又叫魂！又叫魂！”
    小青姑娘一听声音，吐吐舌头朝码头方向跑了。走出不远，有个黑影子闪了一下，接着就抱住了她。只觉得两条挺粗的发辫打在脸上，她明白这是她的女友换子在这里等她。……
    妈妈生了一会闷气，最后自己又笑了。“管不了就不管吧。”她想起今天她们老妈妈们要到山脚下碎石，拿了铁锤子锁了门走了。她向来是这样，只要换子不肯吃饭，她自己也不想吃了。
    7月的海岛的清早是格外清爽的。沿路的白杨树高高地、无声地站着。一层层梯田里的庄稼低垂着头，像没出嫁的姑娘们那样羞怯地窥视着行人。
    太阳一直没露面。微风吹来，云彩飞驰。一会儿骤然有几滴雨点落在地上。很快，零散的雨点就连结成一根根细线。山路被浇湿了。
    爬上第一架山的顶峰，额上就冒汗了。换子妈顺手把落在脸颊上的一绺头发理在耳后。看得清那边碎石场上，已有很多黑点子在蠕动，她已经不是最早的了。码头那里更热闹：青年和姑娘们，正从运输船上抬下什么东西。说笑声顺风传了过来。虽然认不出哪个是自己的女儿，但她感到换子是在那些说笑的人群里，心里就感到一阵快意。忽然她的鼻子又一阵酸，差点掉下泪珠。她想到如果换子的哥哥在，他那样大的力气，论干活哪个小伙子能比得了他！可是……真得把岛子修成个铁的，坏东西们休想再靠这个岛边。……
    忽然有个声音在耳边响起：
    “换子妈，来得这样早！”
    她挥一挥手中的小铁锤，朝她的老女友们笑道：“跟你们比赛比赛！”
