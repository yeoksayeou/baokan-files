Comrade Chairman of the Council of Ministers Cyrankiewicz, Comrades of the Polish Government Delegation, Teachers and Students of Tianjin Universities:

First of all, I should say that I am very happy to be able to accompany Comrade Cyrankiewicz and the comrades of the Polish delegation to my hometown during my youth, and I am especially happy to return to my classmates. If you recognize me as your Tianjin classmate, I am now willing to pay tribute to the Polish Government Delegation in the name of a Tianjin student who participated in the May Fourth Movement thirty-eight years ago and in the name of today's Tianjin youth in the Mao Zedong era. At the same time, I would also like to ask the Polish Government Delegation to convey the respect of our Tianjin youth to the Polish youth.

Comrade Cyrankiewicz just said it well, Poland was once divided by imperialist powers, just like our China was once invaded by imperialist powers. Our two countries have suffered the same colonial persecution. However, after World War II, Poland was liberated earlier than us and started socialist construction earlier than us. That is to say, Poland is ahead of us. Now, after more than ten years of socialist construction and the efforts of the Polish working people, Poland has become an industrialized socialist country. We are as happy about Poland's achievements in building socialism as we are about our own. Although Poland has also made some mistakes in socialist construction, after the Eighth Plenary Session of the Polish United Workers' Party, under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party headed by Comrade Gomulka, the Polish party and government have begun to correct many past mistakes and deviations. Now the Polish people are firmly advancing along the road of socialism. The Polish parliamentary election on January 20 is enough to prove that the Polish working people firmly support the leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party and the Polish socialist system. The Chinese people are as happy about this victory of the Polish people as they are about their own. We believe that Poland's achievements, Poland's victories, and Poland's experiences and lessons are all worthy of learning by the people of our backward socialist China. Not only that, in the process of the Chinese people's revolution, the Polish people have always cared about our cause. Just as Comrade Cyrankiewicz said in Beijing, when the Chinese people's revolution achieved victory, the Polish people were very happy. This shows that the people of our two countries deeply feel that they are closely related and share weal and woe in their respective revolutionary causes. After our revolution was victorious, the Polish people gave a lot of help to our socialist construction, especially in ocean shipping and science and technology. The Sino-Polish Shipping Company working in Tianjin is enough to prove this. I should take this opportunity to express our gratitude to the Polish Government Delegation once again in the name of the people of Tianjin—assuming you recognize that I am also a former citizen of Tianjin.

Now I will say a few more words as a former Tianjin student—and only as a middle school student. I was a student who received middle school education in Tianjin forty years ago. There is no doubt that I received bourgeois education at that time, but bourgeois education also gave some enlightenment to a young man from a feudal family like me at that time. So every time I come to Tianjin, I always tell my former teachers and friends: I still thank Nankai Middle School for giving me those basic knowledge of enlightenment, which made it possible for me to seek new knowledge and contact new knowledge. But this was forty years ago. What about today, forty years later? The students present are all college students. You were born in the era of Mao Zedong. You have the opportunity not only to receive higher education, but also to continue learning in society after completing your studies in school, continue learning at work, and enrich your knowledge in practice. This is a rare opportunity. You are all very clear that in the initial stage of our country's construction, our national compulsory education can generally only be limited to primary schools. That is to say, the vast majority of primary school graduates and the majority of middle school graduates need to participate in labor or prepare to participate in labor. Only a very small number of primary school students, junior high school students, and high school students can go to higher education. And you are part of this very small number. The country has given you opportunities, and you have also made efforts to enable you to study in universities. On the one hand, this is of course a good thing, but on the other hand, it also increases your responsibilities. You have obtained higher knowledge, and you want to enter the society to serve the people. First of all, you should think about how to solve the problem of 600 million people well, that is, how to build a socialist society for 600 million people. This is an arduous task, not easy. Chairman Mao told us that the success of the revolution is only the first step in a long march. Looking back at the thirty years of the people's democratic revolution, although there were many difficulties, it was still simpler than the future construction cause. It is true that many martyrs shed blood and sacrificed to pave the way for us, and their achievements will be immortal. However, in the future socialist construction cause, there will be more difficulties, not less. Young students who can receive higher education today should not take things too simply or too easily. We socialists, socialist youths, should not be afraid of difficulties, but should be prepared to encounter more difficulties, prepare to overcome more difficulties, should not be afraid of making mistakes, but should be prepared to face possible mistakes, prepare to have the courage to admit and correct mistakes, so as to be able to shoulder the major task of building socialism in the future. So I hope you don't just think that now is already a happy era. Of course, compared to the disaster-ridden old society, compared to the era of reactionary rule, now is incomparably happier. This is the reason why our socialist system will inevitably replace the decadent old social system. However, it will not be possible to build a new society overnight, nor will it be possible to do it well in one's lifetime. It is even less likely that after the older generation has done it well, you can enjoy happiness from now on and have no more difficulties. This is absolutely impossible. Otherwise, what are we fighting for for socialism and communism? We should tell young students that what lies before you is a different kind of difficulty, different from the difficulties during the revolution in the past, it is the difficulty in construction. This kind of difficulty could not be encountered in the old society, and even if it was encountered, it could not be solved, but in the new society you will definitely encounter this kind of difficulty, and after you encounter it, you will definitely be able to work hard to overcome it. Therefore, your responsibility should be said to be greater and more arduous than ours. If we, the older generation, want to tell you some experience, that is: you must be more able to work hard, more able to overcome difficulties, more courageous to face mistakes, correct mistakes, and more able to seek new knowledge and increase new knowledge than us. You must be able to create a better future world than us, so that it can continue to move forward. Comrade Cyrankiewicz just said it very well, the future belongs to you. How can the future belong to you? That requires you to shoulder greater and more arduous responsibilities than our older generation, and do your work better than us. Only in this way can you live up to the words of encouragement given to you by Comrade Cyrankiewicz just now, so that the future can truly belong to you, and you will not be abandoned by the future.

### 周恩来总理的讲话

1957-04-11
第4版()
专栏：

    周恩来总理的讲话西伦凯维兹部长会议主席，波兰政府代表团的同志们：天津高等学校的老师们，同学们：
    我首先应该说，我很高兴能够陪同西伦凯维兹同志和波兰代表团的同志们来到我青年时代的故乡，特别高兴的是，回到了我的同学们跟前。如果你们承认我是你们天津的同学的话，我现在愿意以三十八年前参加过“五四”运动的一个天津学生的身份，用今天的毛泽东时代的天津青年名义，向波兰政府代表团致敬。同时，我也愿意把我们天津青年的敬意请波兰政府代表团带回给波兰的青年们。
    刚才西伦凯维兹同志说得不错，波兰曾经受过帝国主义列强的瓜分，好像我们中国曾经受过帝国主义列强的侵略一样。我们两国同样受过殖民主义的迫害。可是第二次世界大战以后，波兰比我们早得到解放，并且比我们早开始社会主义建设。这就是说，波兰走在我们的前面。现在经过十多年社会主义的建设，经过波兰劳动人民的努力以后，波兰已成为一个工业化的社会主义国家。我们把波兰建设社会主义的成就看成是我们自己的成就一样高兴。虽然波兰在社会主义建设当中也曾经犯过一些错误，但是在波兰统一工人党的八中全会以后，在以哥穆尔卡同志为首的波兰统一工人党中央委员会的领导下，波兰的党和政府已经开始纠正了许多过去的错误和偏向。现在波兰人民正在坚定地沿着社会主义的道路前进。这次1月20日的波兰议会选举就足以证明波兰的劳动人民坚定地拥护波兰统一工人党的领导，拥护波兰的社会主义制度。中国人民把波兰人民的这种胜利也看成是我们自己的胜利一样高兴，我们认为波兰的成就，波兰的胜利和波兰的经验教训，都是值得我们后进的社会主义中国的人民学习的。不仅这样，在中国人民革命的过程中，波兰人民始终关心我们的事业。正像西伦凯维兹同志在北京所讲过的，当中国人民革命取得胜利的时候，波兰人民感到非常高兴。这就说明我们两国的人民在各自的革命事业中深深地感到彼此是休戚相关、甘苦与共的。在我们革命胜利了以后，波兰人民对于我们的社会主义建设给了很多的帮助，特别是在远洋航运和科学技术方面。在天津工作的中波航运公司就足以证明这一点。我应该借这个机会以天津市人民的名义——假使你们承认我也是天津过去的一个市民的话——再一次向波兰政府代表团表示我们的感谢。
    我现在再以一个过去的天津学生——而且是仅仅是一个中学生的资格讲几句话。我是四十年前在天津受过中学教育的一个学生。没有疑问，那时受的是资产阶级教育，但是资产阶级教育，对于我当时这样一个封建家庭出身的青年也给予了一些启蒙的知识。所以我每次来到天津，总是告诉我过去的师友说：我还是感谢南开中学给我那些启蒙的基本知识，使我有可能寻求新的知识，接触新的知识。但是这是四十年前的事。四十年后的今天呢？在座的同学都是大学生，你们生在毛泽东的时代，你们已经有可能不仅接受高等教育，而且能够在学校里完成学习以后，到社会上去继续学习，继续在工作中学习，在实践中丰富你们的知识。这是很难得的机会。你们大家都很清楚，在现在我们国家初建的时候，我们的国民义务教育一般地只能限于小学。这就是说绝大多数小学毕业生、大多数的中学毕业生需要参加劳动，或者准备参加劳动。只有极少数的小学生、初中生和高中生才能够升学。而你们正是这个极少数中的一部分。国家给了你们机会，你们自己也作了努力，使你们能够在大学求学。从一方面来说这当然是好事，但是从另一方面来说，也加重了你们的责任。你们求得了高等知识，要进入社会为人民服务，首先你们应该想一想，怎样能够很好地解决六万万人的问题，也就是说怎样为六万万人建设社会主义社会的问题。这是一个艰巨的任务，决不是轻而易举的。毛主席告诉我们，革命的成功才不过是走完了万里长征的第一步。回顾一下三十年人民民主革命时期，固然困难重重，但是比起今后的建设事业来说，那还是较单纯的。不错，在革命中许多烈士流血牺牲替我们开辟了道路，他们的功绩是永垂千古的。可是今后，在社会主义的建设事业中，困难还会更多，而不会更少。今天能够受高等教育的青年同学们不要把事情看得太简单、太容易。我们社会主义者，社会主义的青年，不应该怕困难，而应该准备遇到更多的困难，准备能力去克服更多的困难，不应该怕犯错误，而应该准备面对可能犯的错误，准备勇气去承认和改正错误，以便能够担当起今后建设社会主义的重大任务。所以我希望你们不要仅仅觉得现在已经是幸福的时代了。当然，比起灾难重重的旧社会来，比起反动统治时代来，现在是幸福得不可比拟了。这是我们社会主义制度必然要代替腐朽的旧社会制度的道理。可是，我们要建设起新社会来，也不是旦夕就能成功的，也不是一辈子就能做好的。更不是老一辈子人做好了以后，你们就可以从此享福，从此没有困难了。这是绝对不会有的事。否则，我们为社会主义、为共产主义奋斗什么？我们应该告诉青年同学们，在你们面前的是另一种性质的困难，跟过去革命时候的困难不同，是建设中的困难。这种困难在旧社会中不可能遇到，即使遇到也不能解决，而在新社会里你们一定会遇到这种困难，遇到以后，你们也一定能够努力去克服它。因此，你们的责任，应该说比我们重大，比我们艰巨。如果我们老一辈子的人要告诉你们一些经验的话，那就是：你们要比我们更能够艰苦奋斗，更能够克服困难，更有勇气面对错误，纠正错误，更有能力寻求新的知识、增加新的知识。你们要能够比我们更好地创造未来的世界，使它能够不断地前进。刚才西伦凯维兹同志说得很对，未来是属于你们的。怎样才能使未来属于你们呢？那就要你们比我们老一辈子的人负起更重大的、更艰巨的责任，工作比我们做得更好，这才能够不辜负刚才西伦凯维兹同志给你们的赠言，这样才能够使未来真正地属于你们，而你们才不致为未来所抛弃。（附图片）
