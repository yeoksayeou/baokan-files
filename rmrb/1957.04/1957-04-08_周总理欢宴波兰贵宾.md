Xinhua News Agency, 7th — Premier of the State Council Zhou Enlai held a banquet in Beijing this evening to welcome the Polish People's Republic government delegation headed by Chairman of the Council of Ministers Józef Cyrankiewicz.

At the banquet, Premier Zhou Enlai said that the friendly visit of the Polish People's Republic government delegation, headed by Comrade Cyrankiewicz, to Asian countries will undoubtedly play a positive role in further strengthening the great unity of socialist countries, developing friendly relations between Poland and Asian countries, and easing international tensions. Premier Zhou Enlai also highly praised the Polish people for their unremitting efforts in establishing a European collective security system and preventing the revival of West German militarism; and has consistently sympathized with and supported the just struggle of Asian and African countries against colonialism.

Chairman Cyrankiewicz said in his speech that as soon as the delegation arrived in China, they were warmly received by the Chinese people and felt the deep friendship of the Chinese people towards the Polish people. He said that China is developing at a rapid pace, and this development is the basis for the increasing status of the People's Republic of China, and this development has a huge impact on the balance of power in Asia and the world. It has made, is making, and will continue to make great contributions to the forces of socialism and peace.

Referring to the recent visit of the Polish People's Republic government delegation to several Asian countries, Chairman Cyrankiewicz said that the struggle of the people of these countries for their position is ongoing, and this development is unstoppable; the collapse of decadent colonialism is inevitable. He pointed out that the reason why these changes in these countries cannot be stopped is largely due to the very strong desire of the masses of people in these countries to fight for liberation, due to the existence of the great socialist camp, the existence of the first socialist country, the Soviet Union, the establishment and strengthening of the People's Republic of China, and the unity of the entire socialist camp.

Prior to the banquet, a grand reception attended by more than 1,000 people was held. Accompanied by Vice Chairman Zhu De and Premier Zhou Enlai, Chairman Cyrankiewicz met with responsible persons from various departments of Chinese state organs, various democratic parties, and various people's organizations, senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, people from all walks of life in the capital, and diplomatic officials and economic representatives from Asian, European, and African countries stationed in China.

At the beginning of the banquet, Premier Zhou Enlai delivered a speech (full text on page 3), saying that when he and the Chinese government delegation visited Poland in January this year, Poland left them with a deep and unforgettable impression.

He said that China and Poland are both members of the socialist family, and the people of the two countries are linked by the common ideology of Marxism-Leninism and the common cause of building socialism. Therefore, the friendship between the two countries is eternal, unbreakable, and increasingly consolidated and developed. This visit of the Polish People's Republic government delegation to China is a major event in Sino-Polish relations.

Premier Zhou Enlai said that we are pleased to see that all healthy forces in Poland are uniting more and more closely around the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party headed by Comrade Gomulka, and are working hard to consolidate and develop the cause of socialism. He wished the Polish people greater achievements in the implementation of the new five-year plan. Chairman Cyrankiewicz then delivered a speech (full text on page 3). His speech was warmly welcomed.

    西伦凯维兹主席在讲话时说，代表团一到了中国，就受到中国人民的热情的招待，就感到中国人民对波兰人民的深厚友谊。他说，中国已经是在一日千里的发展，这种发展是中华人民共和国地位日益提高的基础，而这种发展对亚洲和世界力量的对比有着巨大的影响。而对社会主义和和平力量过去有、现在有、将来也会有极大贡献。
    西伦凯维兹主席在谈到波兰人民共和国政府代表团最近访问几个亚洲国家时说，这些国家人民为了争取他们的地位而进行的斗争正在进行，而且这种发展是不可阻止的；腐朽的殖民主义的崩溃是不可避免的。他指出，这些国家这种变化所以不能停止，在很大的程度上是由于这些国家的人民群众有着争取解放的非常强烈的愿望，由于伟大的社会主义阵营的存在、第一个社会主义国家苏联的存在、中华人民共和国的建立和加强，以及整个社会主义阵营的团结一致。

    周恩来总理说，我们高兴地看到波兰一切健康的力量正在日益紧密地团结在以哥穆尔卡同志为首的波兰统一工人党中央委员会的周围，为巩固和发展社会主义事业而努力。他预祝波兰人民在执行新的五年计划中获得更大的成就。　　西伦凯维兹主席接着讲话（全文见第三版）。他的讲话受到了热烈欢迎。
