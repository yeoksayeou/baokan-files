Editor's Note: On April 11, 1955, Shi Zhi'ang, Li Zhaoji, and Zhong Buyun, staff members of the Chinese delegation to the Asian-African Conference, Shen Jiantu, Huang Zuomei, Du Hong, Li Ping, and Hao Fengge, Chinese journalists, Wang Mingfang, a staff member of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Stanlitz, a Polish journalist, Geneviève de Firmes, an Austrian journalist, and staff members of Air India International were murdered by Chiang Kai-shek's special agents. Today marks the second anniversary of their martyrdom. We are publishing these two articles to express our condolences.

Zhi'ang, it has been two whole years since you left this world, left the cause and ideals you devoted yourself to, and left your warm family. But you are not dead! Your spirit still surrounds us, and you still live in the hearts of peace-loving people all over the world.

Two years ago, the enemy, devoid of all conscience, used the most despicable means of murder to take your life. They did not hesitate to resort to such vile behavior to achieve their sinister attempt to sabotage the Asian-African Conference. However, the Asian-African Conference not only still took place, but also brilliantly completed its historical mission, writing a glorious page in the history of mankind's struggle for peace. The influence of the Bandung Spirit has been expanding day by day around the world, the number of countries in favor of peaceful coexistence continues to increase, and the area of peaceful neutrality is expanding. The voices against colonialism and for national independence are spreading across Asia and Africa, like waves in the sea, one after another impacting the imperialist colonial system. Many new independent countries have emerged. The armed aggression of the two old-brand imperialist powers, Britain and France, against Egypt ended in failure. All of this powerfully proves that imperialism has no way to change the direction of historical progress.

Zhi'ang, your sacrifice is an irreparable wound to me. The enemy took my heart away, and I was in such pain that I was dazed. People have feelings. They know happiness and pain. Moreover, our feelings are built on mutual respect and love, sharing joys and sorrows, helping each other, and advancing together. The heinous Chiang Kai-shek's special agents took you away alive, took away our love. How can I not be heartbroken! On this day last year, I came to your grave with a heavy heart, and I couldn't help but be moved to tears. I stood blankly at the place where you are sleeping for a long time, unable to say a word. I felt lost. Suddenly, I heard a sonorous and passionate voice in my ear: "Down with imperialism!" I was slightly stunned. Whose voice is this, so familiar! This is your voice, your voice is calling me, encouraging me, encouraging me to stand up and continue to fight for the revolutionary cause, to fight for the construction of a prosperous and strong motherland. We must not show weakness in front of the enemy. Yes, I know that as long as imperialism exists for one day, the reactionary forces representing the interests of monopoly capitalism will still attempt to carry out military adventures and aggression in the future, and may still launch wars. Peace-loving people all over the world must unite, take action, and be prepared to give the aggressors a head-on blow at any time. As a member of the new Chinese women and as a relative of a martyr, I have a responsibility to take on the cause you have not completed and dedicate my share of strength to the sacred cause of peace.

Zhi'ang, you often said to me: "People must be able to withstand tests and must constantly train themselves. Whether in work or in life, it is impossible to succeed without hard training. We must train ourselves to be people with strong revolutionary will. For the cause of socialism, we can abandon everything personal, even our precious lives." These words are always so clear in my mind, and they constantly encourage me and spur me to work and study more tenaciously.

I also clearly remember that in the spring of 1955, when your son came to Beijing for winter vacation, he asked for your opinion, saying: "Dad, if our school recommends me to study in the Soviet Union after graduating from high school, what is your opinion?" You said: "Why do you need to ask me? I'm just afraid that your qualifications are not good enough." Today, your son is studying in the Soviet Union and is doing very well. But what about you? What about his father? The poor child lost his dearest person - his father - before he was eighteen years old. This caused him such a great shock and loss. However, the teachings you gave him during your lifetime are always in his heart. Under the cultivation of the motherland, he will inherit your legacy and dedicate himself to the construction of the motherland in a better way.

    悼念志昂烈士殉难两周年
    吕雪帷
    编者按　1955年4月11日，我国参加亚非会议代表团工作人员石志昂、李肇基、钟步云，我国记者沈建图、黄作梅、杜宏、李平、郝凤格，越南民主共和国代表团工作人员王明芳，波兰记者斯塔列茨，奥地利记者严斐德和印度国际航空公司的工作人员，遭受蒋介石特务分子的暗害遇难。今天是他们殉难的两周年，特发表这两篇文章，表示悼念。
    志昂，你离开人间，离开那奋身以赴的事业与理想，离开你那温暖的家庭已经整整两年了。但是，你没有死！你的精神依旧围绕在我们的周围，你仍旧活在全世界热爱和平人民的心里。
    两年前，敌人丧尽天良，以最卑劣的谋杀手段夺去了你的生命。他们不惜以如此下流的行为，来达到破坏亚非会议的罪恶企图。但是，亚非会议不但仍旧开了，而且卓越地完成了它的历史任务，在人类和平斗争史上写下了光辉的一页。万隆精神在全世界的影响已日益扩展，赞成和平共处的国家不断增多，和平中立地区正在扩大。反殖民主义，争取民族独立的呼声，布满亚非二大洲，像大海里的波涛一样，一个接着一个冲击着帝国主义的殖民体系。许多新的独立国家出现了。英法两个老牌帝国主义对埃及的武装侵略，落得了失败的下场。这一切，都有力地证明，帝国主义没有办法来改变历史前进的方向。
    志昂，你的牺牲，对我来说，是一个不可弥补的创伤，敌人夺去了我的心，我痛得神志恍惚。人是有感情的。他知道快乐和痛苦。何况我们的感情是建筑在互敬互爱、同甘共苦、互相帮助、共同前进的基础上。万恶的蒋介石特务分子活生生地夺走了你，夺走了我们的爱情，我怎么能不痛心！去年的今天，我抱着沉痛的心情来到你的墓地，禁不住热泪盈眶，呆呆地站立在你长眠的地方，半天发不出声来。我感到茫然。忽然，耳边响起了慷慨、激昂的声音：“打倒帝国主义！”我微怔了，这是谁的声音呀，如此熟悉！这是你的声音，你的声音在呼唤我，鼓舞我，鼓舞我站起来，继续为革命事业奋斗，为建设一个繁荣富强的祖国而奋斗。决不能在敌人面前示弱。是的，我知道，只要帝国主义存在一天，代表垄断资本主义利益的反动势力，今后就仍然会企图进行军事冒险和侵略，并且仍然可能发动战争。全世界爱好和平的人们，必须团结起来，行动起来，准备随时给予侵略者以迎头痛击。作为新中国妇女的一员，作为一个烈士的亲人，我有责任把你未成的事业担当起来，为神圣的和平事业，献出自己的一份力量。
    志昂，你常常对我说：“人要经得起考验，要经常锻炼自己，无论在工作和生活中，不经过艰苦锻炼是不行的。我们一定要把自己锻炼成具有坚强的革命意志的人。为社会主义事业我们可以抛弃个人的一切，甚至宝贵的生命。”这番话，在我的脑海里永远是那么地清晰，它不时激励着我，鞭策着我更顽强地工作、学习。
    我还清楚地记得，1955年春天，你的儿子来北京过寒假的时候，他曾征求你的意见说：“爸爸，如果我们学校选送我高中毕业后去留苏，你的意见如何？”你说：“那还用问我，只怕你的条件不够。”今天你的儿子正在苏联留学，而且成绩很好。可是你呢？他的父亲呢？可怜的孩子未满十八岁，就失去了最亲爱的人——父亲。这使他遭受了多么大的刺激和损失。但是，你生前对他的教导，他无时不记在心里。在祖国的培养下，他将继承你的遗志，更好地献身祖国的建设事业。
