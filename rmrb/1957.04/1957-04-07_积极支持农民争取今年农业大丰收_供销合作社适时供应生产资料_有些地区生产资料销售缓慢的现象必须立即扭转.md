    Actively Support Farmers in Striving for This Year's Bumper Harvest
    Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Should Provide Production Materials in a Timely Manner
    The Slow Sales of Production Materials in Some Areas Must Be Immediately Reversed
    (Our Dispatch) To support this year's bumper harvest, supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions have been supplying agricultural cooperatives with the production materials they need in a timely manner. As of the beginning of March, supply and marketing cooperatives in the five provinces of Henan, Jiangsu, Hubei, Shanxi, and Shaanxi, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, had supplied agricultural cooperatives with various production materials worth a total of about 30 million yuan. Among them, Henan and Jiangsu provinces have supplied 700,000 dan of various fertilizers and more than one million pieces of various old-style farm tools and small farm tools, as well as draft animals, pesticides, agricultural machinery, etc. At the same time, Gansu, Guangxi, Shanxi, Anhui, Shandong, Hebei, Jilin, Yunnan and other provinces supplied agricultural cooperatives with more than 6,900 double-wheeled double (single) furrow plows and more than 200 portable steam engines. Supply and marketing cooperatives in Shandong, Liaoning and other provinces have also strengthened the supply of spare parts for new-style farm tools and the maintenance of farm tools.
    In order to make the supply of production materials more, faster, and better, many county supply and marketing cooperatives in Jiangsu Province have also designated directors or deputy directors to specifically manage and promote the supply of production materials during the spring plowing season, and let cadres who originally worked on production materials "return to their posts." Recently, supply and marketing cooperatives in Jiayu, Puqi, Dawu, Anlu and other counties in Hubei Province organized more than 30 work groups to go deep into the countryside to continue investigating what production materials agricultural cooperatives still need, and to help grassroots cooperatives further improve the supply of production materials.
    Now, supply and marketing cooperatives in Guangxi, Henan, Shandong and other places are supplying agricultural cooperatives with the production materials they need through "three-society" meetings (supply and marketing cooperatives, handicraft cooperatives, agricultural cooperatives) or "four-society" meetings (supply and marketing cooperatives, handicraft cooperatives, credit cooperatives, agricultural cooperatives) and in combination with contracts. According to incomplete statistics from eight special districts in Henan Province, grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in various places have signed more than 2,800 combined contracts with more than 1,200 agricultural cooperatives.
    However, at present, the sales of production materials by supply and marketing cooperatives in some areas are still very slow, generally only completing 30%-40% of the quarterly supply plan. This is due to the incorrect views of some cadres of the supply and marketing cooperative who believe that "it's still early, no need to rush," "production materials are exclusively operated by the supply and marketing cooperative, and agricultural cooperatives will come to the door to buy"; some think that "there are many sources of goods, there will be no problems," etc.; in addition, some agricultural cooperatives in some areas simply rely on and wait for state loans to purchase production materials, and some agricultural cooperatives one-sidedly understand "running cooperatives frugally," and do not actively invest in purchasing production materials that should be purchased, etc. The relevant departments are actively taking effective measures to solve this phenomenon.

    积极支持农民争取今年农业大丰收
    供销合作社适时供应生产资料
    有些地区生产资料销售缓慢的现象必须立即扭转
    本报讯　为了支持今年农业大丰收，各地供销合作社适时地供应了农业社所需要的生产资料。截至3月初为止，河南、江苏、湖北、山西、陕西五省和内蒙古自治区的供销合作社，已供应农业社各种生产资料总值达三千万元左右。其中河南、江苏两省已供应各种肥料七十万担、各种旧式农具和小农具一百多万件，还有耕畜、农药、农械等。与此同时，甘肃、广西、山西、安徽、山东、河北、吉林、云南等省供应了农业社双轮双（单）铧犁六千九百多部、锅驼机二百多台；山东、辽宁等省供销社，还加强了新式农具的零件供应和农具的检修工作。
    为使生产资料供应工作做得又多、又快、又好，江苏省不少县供销社还确定由主任或副主任专门掌握与推动春耕时期生产资料的供应工作，并让原来搞生产资料工作的干部“归队”。湖北嘉鱼、蒲圻、大悟、安陆等县供销社，最近组织了三十多个工作组，深入农村继续调查农业社还需要哪些生产资料，并帮助基层社进一步改进生产资料供应工作。
    现在，广西、河南、山东等地供销社正通过“三社”会议（供销社、手工业社、农业社）或“四社”会议（供销社、手工业社、信用社、农业社）以及结合合同等形式，供应农业社所需的生产资料。据河南省八个专区不完全的统计，各地基层供销社已和一千二百多个农业社签订了二千八百多份结合合同。
    但是，目前尚有一些地区的供销合作社的生产资料销售的还很缓慢，一般仅完成季度供应计划的30％—40％。这是由于供销社的某些干部认为“时间还早，不必着急”、“生产资料由供销社独家经营，农业社要买会上门的”；有的认为“货源多，不会出问题”等不正确的观点；加以有些地区的农业社单纯依靠和等待国家贷款来购置生产资料，有的农业社片面的理解“勤俭办社”，对应该购置的生产资料也不积极投资购买等原因形成的。这种现象，有关部门正在积极采取有效措施，进行解决中。　（白水）
