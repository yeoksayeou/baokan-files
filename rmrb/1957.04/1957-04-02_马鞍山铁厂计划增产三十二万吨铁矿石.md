    Ma'anshan Iron Factory Plans to Increase Iron Ore Production by 320,000 Tons

    (Our newspaper's dispatch) The Ma'anshan Iron Factory is increasing iron ore production in many ways to support the production of iron-smelting furnaces throughout the country.

    After mobilizing various mining sites to meticulously calculate accounts from the bottom up and tap the potential of equipment, the factory has formulated a plan to increase iron ore production by 320,000 tons this year. To ensure the realization of this production increase plan, each mining site has strengthened stripping and other mining work.

    While vigorously increasing production at existing mines, the Ma'anshan Iron Factory is stepping up the construction of a modern sintering plant and the resumption of production at the Aoshan Iron Mine. The new sintering plant project commenced construction on March 1 and is expected to be completed and put into operation this year. The Aoshan Iron Mine's resumption project is also actively underway. The iron ore grade of this mine is very high, with an average iron content of over 50%. The proven recoverable ore reserves are sufficient for the Ma'anshan Iron Factory's existing blast furnaces for more than half a century. Calculated based on its design capacity, its annual iron ore production is sufficient for the Ma'anshan Iron Factory's use for one year. The resumption project is expected to be completed in just over nine months.

    马鞍山铁厂计划增产三十二万吨铁矿石
    本报讯　马鞍山铁厂正在从多方面增产铁矿石，支援全国各地的炼铁炉生产。
    这个厂经过发动各采矿场自下而上地算细账和挖掘设备潜力以后，已经制定了今年增产三十二万吨铁矿石的计划。为了保证这一增产计划的实现，各个采矿场都加强了采矿的剥离等工作。
    在现有矿场大力增产的同时，马鞍山铁厂正在加紧新建一座现代化的烧结场和恢复凹山铁矿的生产。烧结场新建工程已于3月1日动工兴建，预计今年内可以建成投入生产，凹山铁矿的恢复工程也正在积极进行。这个矿的铁矿品位很高，平均含铁量在50％以上，已探明的可采矿量足够马鞍山铁厂现有高炉用半个多世纪。根据设计能力计算，它每年生产的铁矿石足够马鞍山铁厂用一年，恢复工程预计九个多月可以完成。
