The following is reported by Wu Jian, reporter for the Shanxi Daily: Shanxi Province's "Underground Fish Farm" - the famous Lijiazhuang Grotto in Wutai County, began selling fish to the outside world before the Qingming Festival.

When the reporter arrived at the scene, a crescent moon had just risen. Under the moonlight, schools of fish were seen constantly gushing out of a grotto the size of a bowl. In another smaller, water chestnut-shaped grotto, the water flow was slower. Here, the fish, head to tail, wagged their tails one by one, flowing out of the grotto with the water.

The fish are yellow and black in color, and their shape resembles that of carp. Each side has a golden red line running from head to tail. The meat is tender and delicious, and the local farmers praised them as "Golden Thread Carp". Li Qizhen, an 87-year-old farmer who goes there every year to wait for the fish, told reporters that when the carp harvest is abundant, he can wait for more than 30,000 fish in one night. Therefore, people from dozens of miles around carry baskets and bags to wait for the fish.

Lijiazhuang is located at the junction of Wutai, Mengxian and Dingxiang counties. According to legend, "Stone Cave Fishing", one of the eight scenic spots of this county, has a history of hundreds of years.

    石窟里涌出“金丝鲤鱼”
    本报讯　据山西日报记者吴坚报道：山西省“地下鱼场”——著名的五台县李家庄石窟，在清明节前夕开始向外出鱼。
    当记者赶到现场的时候，一钩新月刚刚升起，趁着月光，只见鱼群从一个碗口大的石窟里不断地向外涌了出来。在另一个较小的状似菱角形的石窟里，水的流速比较慢，这里的鱼，头尾相衔，一个个摇着尾巴从石窟里顺水而出。
    鱼的颜色，有黄、黑两种，它们的形状好像鲤鱼，两侧各有金色红线贯穿首尾，肉细味美，当地农民誉之为“金丝鲤鱼”。一年一度前往等鱼的八十七岁的农民李其贞告诉记者说，遇到鲤鱼丰收的时候，一个夜间可以等得三万多尾。因此，附近数十里的群众背筐携袋，纷纷前往等鱼。
    李家庄位于五台、盂县和定襄三县交界的地方。相传，作为这县八景之一的“石窟鏖鱼”，已经有了数百年的历史。
