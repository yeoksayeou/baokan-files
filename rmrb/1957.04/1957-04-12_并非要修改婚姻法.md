    Not About Amending the Marriage Law

    To the Editor:
    I am a worker at the Dingfeng Refractory and Acid-Resistant Materials Factory in Boshan, Shandong. Recently, I heard talk that "a new Marriage Law is about to be implemented, requiring women to be 25 and men to be 30 to marry." Many young people, hearing this rumor, are rushing to get married. For example, Li Xiangtai, a worker at our factory, had not planned to marry yet, but upon hearing that the Marriage Law was about to be amended, he hurried to the government to complete the marriage registration procedures.
    I believe that publishing articles in newspapers and periodicals advocating late marriage is to educate young people, helping them recognize the advantages and disadvantages of late and early marriage, and consciously and correctly handle their own marriage issues. It is not to restrict young people who have reached the marriageable age, forcing them to postpone marriage for a few more years.
    I hope that those who suspect that the government is about to amend the Marriage Law will quickly correct their erroneous thinking.

### 并非要修改婚姻法

    并非要修改婚姻法编辑同志：
    我是山东博山鼎丰耐火耐酸材料总厂的工作人员。最近，我听到说：“快要实行女子二十五岁，男子三十岁结婚的新婚姻法了”。许多青年听到这种传说，都争先恐后地办理婚事。如我厂工人李向太，本来还未打算结婚，听说要修改婚姻法了，赶紧到政府办了结婚登记手续。
    我认为报刊上发表提倡晚婚的文章，是教育青年人，认清晚婚和早婚的利弊，自觉地正确地处理自己的婚姻问题。并不是要限制已达婚龄的青年人，一定要推迟几年再结婚。
    希望那些猜疑政府将要修改婚姻法的人们，赶快纠正自己的错误思想。　杨守惠
