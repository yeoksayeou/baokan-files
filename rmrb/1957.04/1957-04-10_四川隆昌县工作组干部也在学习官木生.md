    The entire township of joint township cadres and the working group cadres in Longchang County, Sichuan Province, are learning from Guan Musheng's methods of participating in production and leading production, and are going deep into third-class societies and third-class teams to lead production. The township general branch secretary, deputy secretary, and township women's director are working alongside commune members to weed the spring crops, soak grain seeds, and dig soil edges. Working group cadres Chen Dingyuan, Liang Shifa, and others are working with commune members to make seedling fields, dig pit soil, and store sweet potato seeds. They have formed close friendships with the commune members through joint labor, thus learning about many problems related to commune members not working, not investing, and internal management. The township general branch promptly solved these problems. Liang Shifa, a working cadre of the Fifth Village Central Society, learned while digging pit soil with the commune members that the main reason why the commune members were not working was financial chaos and that no accounts had been published for a year; the by-products were distributed too little, and the commune members had to go out to find firewood, etc. He reported these problems to the general branch. The general branch immediately sent people to supervise the agricultural society in clearing the accounts and contacted the Grain Bureau to supply commune members with rice husks. The next day, eleven women from the first team, who had never worked before, came out to participate in field labor. Now a new atmosphere has emerged in the spring plowing and production throughout the township. Commune members from five villages invested more than 300,000 catties of fertilizer in the society in one day. On March 4th, more than 550 men, women, and children were mobilized to pull green grass, pulling more than 90,000 catties in two days. Li Erniang, a 60-year-old from the Third Society of the Tenth Village, also came out to work, pulling more than 400 catties of green grass by herself. All villages are busy drawing water for irrigation, soaking grain seeds, and plowing and harrowing seedling fields. A tense atmosphere has emerged in the spring plowing and production.

    四川隆昌县工作组干部也在学习官木生
    四川省隆昌县联合乡全体乡干部和工作组干部学习官木生参加生产，领导生产的方法，深入三类社、三类队领导生产。乡总支书记、副书记和乡妇女主任，他们同社员一起薅小春、泡谷种、挖土边。工作组干部陈定院、梁士发等同社员们一起做秧田，挖坑土，窖苕种。他们和社员在共同劳动中结成亲密的朋友，从而了解到许多社员不出工、不投资和社内经营管理中的问题。乡总支将这些问题及时的加以解决。五村中心社工作干部梁士发，在和社员同挖坑土的时候，了解到社员不出工的主要原因是财务混乱，一年来没有公布过账目；副产品分得少，社员要出去找柴烧等。他把这些问题向总支汇报。总支即时派人督促农业社清理账目，并和粮食局联系，供应社员糠壳。第二天从来不出工的一队妇女，就有十一个出来参加了田间劳动。现在全乡春耕生产出现了新的气象。有五个村的社员一天就向社投了三十多万斤肥料。在3月4日这一天就出动了五百五十多个男女老小扯青草，两天扯了九万多斤。十村三社六十岁的李二娘也出来干活了，她一个人就扯了四百多斤青草。各村都在忙着车水上冲，泡谷种，犁耙秧田。春耕生产出现一片紧张的气象。　（张仲源）
