Early Spring Chill Recedes, Gardeners Hurry to Raise Seedlings

We Must Not Always View Intellectuals with Old Eyes

From the capital to major cities, various academic and creative activities are more active than in the past, and the intellectual community has begun to take practical actions to support the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend."

However, to implement this policy and to open up an era of prosperity in literature and science, some ideological obstacles must be cleared. People have talked a lot about this issue, and I don't want to repeat it. In order to eliminate various concerns, I think it is necessary to make a correct assessment of the specific situation of today's intellectuals.

Once, I asked an old professor why he had to "hide" his writings "in famous mountains"? He said with a wry smile: "When others see my name, they always think that I am not a Marxist. If my work is published, it is difficult to avoid being labeled with a hat of idealism. Then why bother to ask for trouble?" These words revealed the feelings of some intellectuals: they demanded that society not underestimate their progress and not always view them with old eyes. They hated rude criticism and opposed indiscriminate labeling.

It should be admitted that in the past few years, the professional level and political awareness of Chinese intellectuals have improved significantly to varying degrees, and they have also played a significant role in the cause of socialist construction. However, as far as the entire intellectual community is concerned, those who are relatively familiar with Marxism-Leninism still account for only a small number. Although most people are willing or have begun to study, they have learned very little and cannot well use the position, viewpoint, and method of Marxism-Leninism to observe things and analyze problems. They should further transform themselves: on the one hand, they must strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism, and on the other hand, they must have more contact with workers and peasants.

I believe that if the leaders of relevant departments can eliminate prejudices, see the progressive side of intellectuals, respect their talents, and give them greater political trust, they will no longer be insincere in implementing the "Hundred Schools of Thought" policy, and they will not say "let go" but refuse to "let go". At the same time, if our intellectuals can calmly reflect on themselves, deeply understand that "educators must be educated," and admit that their level of Marxism-Leninism is not very high, then they will welcome the help and well-intentioned criticism from others (of course, we only welcome comradely, realistic, and reasoning criticism, and resolutely oppose criticism that "kills with one blow"), so that we can continuously improve ourselves through "blooming freely" and "contending". In this way, we will have the courage to carry out creative scientific research and creation activities, and we will no longer want to "let go" and "contend" but dare not "let go" and "contend". At present, the reason why "flowers" are not blooming much and "schools" are not contending loudly is mainly because there is not enough freedom.

At present, the reason why "flowers" are not "blooming" much and "schools" are not "contending" loudly is mainly because there is not enough freedom, and the leaders of relevant departments have not seriously implemented the Party Central Committee's policy. To build our motherland into a great socialist industrial power, we must unite and mobilize all possible forces. I personally feel that the intellectual community in our country today still has great potential. As long as we dig it out well, it can be transformed into a material force that is beneficial to the cause of socialist construction. As long as relevant parties further let go and resolutely implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," they can feel that there is a "place to use their talents." Only in this way can we mobilize all the positive factors of the intellectual community, and only then can we talk about catching up with the advanced level of world science.

In our society, advocating "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" does not mean that we do not need a certain organization and leadership, nor does it mean that we want to live in a state of anarchy. From this perspective, the situation in the natural sciences is much better than that in the social sciences. Obviously, the academic paper report meetings held by various natural science societies play a role in promoting "letting go" and "contending." Unfortunately, this thriving atmosphere cannot be seen in the social sciences, especially in the field of economics. A friend said humorously: "Agriculture and handicrafts have been collectivized, but we economists are still working as individual households." I believe that if we gather the "scattered soldiers and idle generals" on the economic science front, it will not be difficult to form a vital force to advance towards science. Not long ago, I had dinner with many old friends in the economics field. Everyone deeply felt that the socialist construction of the motherland is advancing rapidly, and more and more theoretical problems are emerging from the real economic life, and they are becoming more and more complex. We must concentrate the strength of all parties, divide the labor and cooperate, and solve them together. However, our original "China New Economics Research Association" has long existed in name only. I remember that in the early days of liberation, the "New Economics Society" held several academic seminars, and the published transcripts of the seminars (such as on "Imperialism and Aggressive War") aroused attention from all parties. We all earnestly hope that the "New Economics Society" can be revived or rebuilt in the short term, and that it will actively organize scientific discussions following the Chinese Philosophical Society, the Historical Society, and the Political Science and Law Society. The early spring chill is gradually receding, and the warm current is slowly coming. But to have a hundred flowers in full bloom, we must quickly open the garden gate wide and let the gardeners in to cultivate seedlings.

In order to broaden the channels of speech and speak freely, many people believe that we should not draw circles around "letting a hundred schools of thought contend". In principle, I also agree with this view. However, we want to "let go" and "contend," we cannot be without a goal to strive for. I believe that our current goal should be to bring our backward academic culture up to or even catch up with the advanced level of the world within a certain period. Therefore, if our "letting go" and "contending" can be carried out around long-term scientific planning, it will kill two birds with one stone and make greater contributions to the people and the country. In fact, there are quite a few objects of "contending" that are included in the scientific plan. Taking the economics field as an example, the central issues currently being debated include the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie during the transition period, the nature of fixed interest, and the role of the law of value in my country's economic development. They are also the main research projects listed in the long-term plan of political economy. However, there are many more theoretical problems that no one has touched upon so far. When we were asked to formulate a scientific plan last year, it could be described as "urgent as a shooting star". But after the long-term plan was formulated, it seemed like a "stone sinking into the sea". In this regard, the Institute of Economics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences has not united and mobilized the strength of economic science workers across the country, and there is a tendency to conduct research behind closed doors. A year has passed, and many blank spots are still blank. How can we reach the advanced level of the world in the predetermined period? It must also be added that I advocate "letting go" and "contending" around long-term scientific planning, but I did not take it as a circle to restrict everyone's free research and discussion. If there is something outside the scientific plan that needs to be "let go" and "contended", it is of course welcome.

Today, we should say that compared with before liberation, Chinese intellectuals are living in spring, and spring is always lovely. Chairman Mao's two speeches at the Supreme State Conference and the Central Propaganda Work Conference brought new warmth and vitality to the intellectual community. Now it can be said that the early spring chill is gradually receding, and the warm current is slowly coming. Once the weather warms up, the flowers will bloom. But to have a hundred flowers in full bloom, the hard work of gardeners is also indispensable. Quickly open the garden gate wide and let the gardeners run in to cultivate seedlings and apply fertilizer. I believe that in the near future, on this beautiful land of our motherland, there will be colorful literary and academic flowers blooming everywhere.

    早春寒意消，园丁快育苗
    北京师范大学政治教育系教授  陶大镛
    不能老是用一副旧眼光来看待知识分子
    从首都到各大城市，各种学术和创作活动都比过去显得活跃，知识界已开始用实际行动来拥护“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针了。
    但是，要贯彻这个方针，要开辟一个文艺和科学的繁荣时代，还须扫清一些思想障碍。关于这方面的问题，大家谈论得比较多，我不想再重复了。为了消除种种顾虑，我认为对今天知识分子的具体情况作出正确的估价，是有必要的。
    有一次，我问一位老教授为什么要把写成的东西“藏之名山”？他面带苦笑地对我说：“别人一看到我的名字，总认为我不是一个马克思主义者，东西发表了，就难保不给我扣上一顶唯心主义的帽子，那又何必自讨苦吃呢？”这几句话，流露了一部分知识分子的心情：他们要求社会上不要低估了他们的进步，不要老是用一副旧眼光来看待他们，他们厌恶粗暴的批评，反对乱扣帽子。
    应该承认，在过去几年中，我国知识分子的业务水平和政治思想觉悟已经有了显著的、不同程度的提高，他们在社会主义建设事业中也发挥了重大的作用；然而，就整个知识界来看，对马克思列宁主义比较熟悉的，毕竟还只占少数；多数人虽愿意或开始学习了，但是学得还很少，还不能很好地运用马克思列宁主义的立场、观点和方法来观察事物和分析问题，还应该进一步改造自己：一面要加强马克思列宁主义的学习，一面要更多地与工农群众接触。
    我认为，如果有关部门的领导者能弭除成见，能看到知识分子的进步的一面，能尊重他们的才学并在政治上给予更大的信任，对贯彻“百家争鸣”的方针就不会再阳奉阴违，就不致于再说“放”而不肯“放”。同时，如果我们知识分子能平心静气地反躬自问，能深切体会到“教育者必须受教育”，能承认自己的马克思列宁主义水平还不很高，那就会欢迎别人的帮助和善意的批评（当然，我们只欢迎同志式的、实事求是和以理服人的批评，坚决反对“一棍子打死”的批评），使我们通过“齐放”和“争鸣”来不断地提高自己。这样，我们才会有勇气来进行创造性的科学研究和创作活动，才不会再想“放”、想“鸣”而不敢“放”、不敢“鸣”。在目前，“花”之所以放得不多，“家”之所以鸣得还不响，关键在于放手得不够。
    在目前，“花”之所以“放”得不多，“家”之所以“鸣”得还不响，重要的关键仍在于放手得不够，在于有关部门的领导者还没有认真贯彻党中央的方针。要把祖国建成一个伟大的社会主义工业强国，我们就得团结、动员一切可能团结、动员的力量。我个人感觉，今天我国的知识界还蕴藏着很大的潜力，只要好好地挖掘出来，就能化为有利于社会主义建设事业的物质力量；只要有关方面进一步放手，坚决贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，就能使他们感到有了“用武之地”。只有这样，才有可能调动知识界的一切积极因素，才谈得到赶上世界科学的先进水平。
    在我们社会里，提倡“百花齐放、百家争鸣”，并不是不要一定的组织领导，并不是要我们生活在无政府状态中。从这方面看，自然科学界的情况，要比社会科学界好得多。很明显，各种自然科学学会所举行的学术论文报告会，对“放”和“鸣”是多少起着推动作用的。很遗憾，在社会科学界、特别是经济学界还看不到这种欣欣向荣的气象。有位朋友说得很幽默：“农业和手工业都合作化了，我们搞经济学的还都是单干户。”我相信，如果把经济科学战线上的“散兵游勇”收聚拢来，决不难编成一支向科学进军的生力军。不久前，我跟好多位经济学界的老友一起晚餐，大家都深深感到：祖国的社会主义建设一日千里，从现实经济生活中提出来的理论问题愈来愈多，也愈来愈复杂，必须集中各方面的力量，分工合作，共同加以解决。可是，我们原有的“中国新经济学研究会”早已名存实亡了。我记得在解放初期，“新经济学会”还召开过几次学术讨论会，会后发表的座谈记录（如关于“帝国主义与侵略战争”）曾引起各方的重视。我们都殷切地希望：“新经济学会”能在短期内复活或重建起来，并且继中国哲学会、史学会和政法学会之后，积极地组织科学讨论。早春寒意渐消，暖流徐徐而来，但要百花盛开，还得快把园门大打开，让园丁进去育苗。
    为了广开言路和畅所欲言，许多人认为对“百家争鸣”不应该画圈圈。我在原则上也同意这种看法。但是我们要“放”、要“鸣”，总不能没有一个努力的目标。我认为，我们当前的目标，应该是在一定时期内，把我国落后的学术文化，达到甚至赶上世界的先进水平。因此，我们的“放”和“鸣”，如能围绕着长期科学规划来进行，那就会一举两得，对人民、对国家将作出更大的贡献。事实上，有好些“争鸣”的对象，都是包括在科学规划之中的。拿经济学界来说，目前争论的中心问题有过渡时期工人阶级与资产阶级的矛盾、定息的性质、价值规律在我国经济发展中的作用等，它们也都是政治经济学远景规划中所列的主要研究项目；然而，另有更多的理论问题，至今还无人问津。去年要我们拟制科学规划的时候，真可谓“急如星火”；但长期规划订出以后，又好像“石沉大海”一样。在这方面，科学院经济研究所并没有把全国经济科学工作者的力量团结、动员起来，有关门研究的倾向。一年过去了，许多空白点还是空白，我们又怎么能在预定时期内达到世界先进水平呢？还必须附带说一句：我主张围绕着长期科学规划来“放”和“鸣”，并没有把它作为圈圈，来限制大家的自由研究和讨论；如果有科学规划以外的东西要“放”和“鸣”，当然也是值得欢迎的。
    今天，我们应该说：与解放前相比，我国知识分子是生活在春天里，春天总是可爱的。毛主席在最高国务会议和中央宣传工作会议上的两次讲话，更给知识界带来了新的温暖和生气。现在可以说是早春寒意渐消，暖流徐徐而来。天一暖，花就会开。但要百花盛开，也少不了园丁的辛勤栽培。快把园门大大地打开吧，让园丁们跑进去育苗施肥，相信不久的将来，在我们这片秀丽的祖国大地上，随处都会开遍着鲜艳夺目的文艺和学术之花。
