A Record of a Visit to Jade Spring Mountain
Chen Yi

Soviet Chairman Voroshilov and the distinguished guests of the delegation visited Vice Chairman Zhu De and toured Jade Spring Mountain together. I accompanied them and wrote a six-stanza poem to record the event and pay my respects.

　　(I) April at Jade Spring is lush,
　　The garden is full of plum, white, and peach red.
　　The Soviet Chairman graces us with his presence,
　　Visiting the Chinese Marshal.

　　(II) Guests and host sit and chat happily,
　　The conversation moves to the Jade Spring, which does not freeze.
　　After several rounds of fine tea,
　　They are invited to begin the garden tour.

　　(III) Several towering ginkgo trees,
　　Have seen over a thousand years pass.
　　The Chairman himself embraces one,
　　Three people, six hands, make a circle.

　　(IV) Rows of green pines stand solemnly,
　　Countless white birches reach for the clouds.
　　Magnolias appear in red and white,
　　The guests and host stroll leisurely through the forest.

　　(V) The Chairman does not seem old at all,
　　He is robust and healthier than most.
　　Just look at his brisk pace,
　　Pointing out the beauty of the mountains and streams.

　　(VI) Everyone's enthusiasm for the tour does not wane,
　　I also follow slowly behind.
　　Delighted to see leaders visiting each other,
　　The Sino-Soviet friendship is boundless.

    游玉泉山纪实
    陈毅
    苏联伏罗希洛夫主席及代表团各贵宾来拜访朱德副主席并同游玉泉山。余伴游，作六言诗记其事并致敬意。
          （一）四月玉泉春浓，满园李白桃红。苏联主席光临，拜访中国元戎。
          （二）宾主小坐欢谈，话到不冻玉泉。几番佳茗用过，就请开始游园。
          （三）几株参天银杏，岁月过了千年。主席亲自合抱，三人六手成圆。
          （四）几排苍松肃立，无数白桦干云。玉兰红白间出，宾主缓步穿林。
          （五）主席毫不出老，结实康健过人。试看步履如飞，指点水秀山明。
          （六）大家游兴不倦，我亦慢步追从。喜见领导互访，中苏友谊无穷。
