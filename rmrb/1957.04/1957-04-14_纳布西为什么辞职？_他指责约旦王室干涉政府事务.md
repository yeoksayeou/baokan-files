Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, April 13th: According to a report in "People's News" on April 12th, the resigned Jordanian Prime Minister Nabsi said in an interview with reporters that he was dismissed after a conflict with people who unconstitutionally interfered in government affairs.

Nabsi said that after the Jordanian government terminated the Anglo-Jordanian Treaty, it adopted the following six principles as the basis of its program: removing imperialists and supporters of the Baghdad Pact from the government of this country; stopping American conspiracies in Jordan; safeguarding the constitutional powers of the government; organizing a federation with Egypt and Syria; implementing an Arab liberation policy; and pursuing a policy of active neutrality with Syria and Egypt. He said that after adopting these principles, the cabinet "found that it could not continue in office in order to implement these principles."

Nabsi said that the cabinet decided not to resign but to continue to maintain itself, and to "take all necessary steps to safeguard the constitutional powers of the government." He said that the cabinet began to purge government agencies and decided to dismiss eleven senior officials.

Nabsi said: "But we were asked to resign, so we submitted our resignations."

Nabsi said that the "conflict" involving external interference in government affairs began about five months ago when his cabinet had just taken office. He said that the cabinet delayed taking action on the issue of unconstitutional actions "in order to concentrate on more important work, namely liberating Jordan and ending the 1948 treaty with Britain."

To illustrate the "conflict of powers that hindered the handling of state affairs," Nabsi cited the following examples: the Jordanian King's confidant, the Jordanian Court Chief Tarhouni, had ordered the confiscation of Jordanian newspapers, while such orders should have been issued by the government; Tarhouni ordered Kufti, the head of the Jordanian delegation to the Tunisian Independence Day celebrations, to return home without consulting the cabinet; Tarhouni recently also visited Arab countries, delivering letters from Jordanian King Hussein to Saudi Arabian King Saud, Egyptian President Nasser, and Syrian President Kuwatly, while "the government was unaware that Tarhouni had made the visit."

Xinhua News Agency, April 13th: Amman News: The Jordanian cabinet crisis, which has lasted for three days, still shows no signs of ending today. Sources say that King Hussein has asked the Speaker of the Upper House, Said Mufti, to form a cabinet.

Since Nabsi was dismissed on April 10th, the Jordanian King has successively asked former Foreign Minister Khalidi and former Defense Minister Abdul Halim Nimer to form a cabinet. Khalidi's attempt to form a cabinet failed because he did not receive the support of several major Jordanian political parties, and Nimer's attempt to form a cabinet also yielded no results.

### 纳布西为什么辞职？  他指责约旦王室干涉政府事务

    纳布西为什么辞职？
    他指责约旦王室干涉政府事务
    新华社开罗13日电　据“人民报”4月12日报道，已经辞职的约旦首相纳布西在接见新闻记者时说，他是在跟违反宪法干预政府事务的人们发生冲突之后被解职的。
    纳布西说，约旦政府在结束英—约条约之后，采取了下述六项原则作为它的纲领的基础：把帝国主义和巴格达条约的支持者从这个国家的政府中清除出去；制止美国在约旦的阴谋；维护政府的宪法权力；跟埃及和叙利亚一起组织联邦；执行阿拉伯解放政策；同叙利亚和埃及一起奉行积极的中立政策。他说，内阁在采取这些原则以后“发现它不能继续留任以便执行这些原则”。
    纳布西说，内阁决定不辞职而继续维持下去，并且“采取一切必要的步骤来维护政府的宪法权力”。他说，内阁开始清洗政府机构，并且决定解除十一个高级官员的职务。
    纳布西说：“但是我们被要求，辞职，于是我们提出了辞呈。”
    纳布西说，牵涉到外界对政府事务的干涉的“冲突”是在大约五个月以前他的内阁刚就职的时候开始的。他说，内阁延缓对违反宪法的问题采取行动，“为的是聚精会神做更重要的工作，即解放约旦和结束1948年同英国缔结的条约”。
    为了说明“使国务的处理受到妨害的权力的冲突”，纳布西举出了下面一些例子：约旦国王的亲信、约旦宫廷总管塔尔霍尼曾经下令没收约旦的报纸，而这种命令本来是应当由政府发布的；塔尔霍尼没有同内阁磋商就命令参加突尼斯独立节的约旦代表团团长库弗提返国；塔尔霍尼最近还访问了阿拉伯国家，把约旦国王侯赛因的信交给了沙特阿拉伯国王沙特、埃及总统纳赛尔和叙利亚总统库阿特利，而“政府却不知道塔尔霍尼去作了访问”。
    据新华社13日讯　安曼消息：已经延续了三天的约旦内阁危机到今天仍然没有要结束的迹象。有消息说，国王侯赛因已经要求上院议长赛义德·穆弗蒂出来组阁。
    从4月10日纳布西被解职以后，约旦国王曾经先后要求前外交大臣哈利迪和前国防大臣阿卜杜勒·哈利姆·尼默尔出来组阁。哈利迪的组阁活动因为得不到约旦几个主要政党的支持而失败，尼默尔的组阁活动也没有结果。
