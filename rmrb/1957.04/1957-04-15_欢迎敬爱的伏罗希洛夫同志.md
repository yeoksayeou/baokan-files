    Welcome Esteemed Comrade Voroshilov
    Zhu De
    Comrade Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, is coming to our country for a friendly visit. This is a grand event of great significance in the lives of our people, in the friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union, and even in the relations between the entire socialist countries. I, along with the 600 million people of the country, express our heartfelt and warm welcome to Comrade Voroshilov, who has traveled a long way despite his hard work.
    Comrade Voroshilov is one of the outstanding leaders of the Soviet state and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. His fighting life is inseparable from the Russian workers' movement and is closely linked to the growth, consolidation, and development of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet state. As early as 1896, he began to dedicate himself to the great cause of the proletarian revolution, day after day for sixty years. The Tsarist government arrested, persecuted, and exiled him many times, but it could not obliterate his determination to fight for the noble cause of the class, but instead made him more determined and confident. Because of this, Comrade Voroshilov won the love and trust of the Russian working class and revolutionaries early on.
    In 1917, Comrade Voroshilov actively participated in the Russian February Revolution and the Great October Socialist Revolution, becoming one of the most important political and military activists at the time. In the years of opposing imperialist armed intervention and the civil war, Comrade Voroshilov established special merits for the young Soviet state. The world-shaking defense of Tsaritsyn in 1918 was won under the personal leadership of Comrade Stalin and Comrade Voroshilov. After crushing imperialist armed intervention, Comrade Voroshilov, along with other leaders of the Soviet party and government, worked hard to build and consolidate the Soviet armed forces. Due to his outstanding contribution in this area, Comrade Voroshilov was awarded the title of the first Marshal of the Soviet Union in 1935. During the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union, Comrade Voroshilov was a member of the Supreme Defense Committee and participated in leading the Soviet army to defeat the Fascist invaders. After the war, Comrade Voroshilov continued to hold important positions in the Soviet party and state work. He has made important contributions to strengthening the strength of the Soviet state and the Soviet people's cause of building communism, and enjoys a high prestige among the Soviet people. During my visit to the Soviet Union last year, I had the opportunity to meet and contact Comrade Voroshilov and other Soviet state leaders. Comrade Voroshilov's approachable, kind, and sincere attitude and his deep affection for the Chinese people left me with an unforgettable impression. This time, I and the people of our country are very excited and honored to have the opportunity to welcome such a senior and highly respected veteran communist fighter with great achievements in our country.
    Comrade Voroshilov's visit to our country as the head of the Soviet state is a full proof of the brotherly and unbreakable friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, and has a significant meaning for the further development of this friendship. Since the signing of the great fraternal alliance between China and the Soviet Union on February 14, 1950, the friendly cooperation between our two countries in economic, political, cultural, and other aspects has expanded and consolidated year by year. In international affairs, we also work hand in hand and make joint efforts to strive for easing international tensions and promoting international cooperation. This unity and close cooperation between the 800 million people of China and the Soviet Union not only greatly enhances mutual understanding and friendship between the people of our two countries and promotes the progress of the socialist construction and communist construction of the two countries, but also becomes the most powerful factor in maintaining world peace and promoting the development of human progress. The imperialist aggressive groups understand this fact and fear this fact as much as groundhogs fear the sun. Therefore, for several years, they have always tried to find even the slightest gap in the relations between our two countries, like panning for gold in the sand. The imperialist propaganda organs have never relaxed the opportunity to provoke disputes on the issue of Sino-Soviet relations. But unfortunately for them, they have not succeeded in the past, and they will never have any hope of success now and in the future. The reason why the unity of the people of China and the Soviet Union can withstand all tests is because our unity is built on an unbreakable foundation. We have the common ideology of Marxism-Leninism and the great common goal of building socialism and communism; at the same time, we are responsible for the vital interests of the 800 million people and the fundamental interests of the cause of progress of all mankind. The unity of the people of China and the Soviet Union is the strong core of the unity of the entire socialist camp. With this unity, we have the power to overcome all difficulties in the way forward, so that the victory of peace and socialism is most reliably guaranteed.
    Comrade Voroshilov's visit to our country this time is a vivid manifestation of the deep friendship of the Soviet people towards the people of our country, and also a new contribution of the Soviet Union to strengthening the friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union and strengthening the unity of the entire socialist camp. The Soviet Union is the most intimate and selfless friend of the people of our country and the great helper of our socialist construction. I firmly believe that the people of our country will welcome Comrade Voroshilov's visit to our country with the greatest enthusiasm, to express our gratitude to the Soviet Union, to express the brotherly friendship to the Soviet people, and to express the eternal and unbreakable unity of the people of China and the Soviet Union.

    欢迎敬爱的伏罗希洛夫同志
    朱德
    苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫同志要到我国来进行友好访问了。这在我国人民的生活中，在中苏两国的友好关系以至整个社会主义国家的关系上，都是一件盛大的具有十分重要意义的事情。我和全国六亿人民一道，对不辞辛劳远道前来的伏罗希洛夫同志表示由衷的热烈的欢迎。
    伏罗希洛夫同志是苏维埃国家和苏联共产党的杰出领导人之一。他的战斗的一生，是同俄国的工人运动分不开的，是同苏联共产党和苏维埃国家的成长、巩固和发展紧密地联系着的。早在1896年时，他就开始把自己献身给无产阶级革命的伟大事业，六十年来如一日。沙皇政府对他进行了多次逮捕、迫害和流放，丝毫也不能磨灭他为崇高的阶级事业奋斗的决心，却反而使他斗志更加昂扬，信心更加坚定。正因为如此，伏罗希洛夫同志早年就赢得了俄国工人阶级和革命者的热爱和信赖。
    1917年，伏罗希洛夫同志积极地参加了俄国二月革命和伟大十月社会主义革命，成为当时最重要的政治和军事活动家之一。在反对帝国主义武装干涉和国内战争的年代里，伏罗希洛夫同志为年轻的苏维埃国家建立了特殊的功勋。1918年威震世界的察里津保卫战，就是在斯大林同志和伏罗希洛夫同志的亲自领导下取得胜利的。在粉碎帝国主义武装干涉以后，伏罗希洛夫同志和苏联党政其他领导人一起，努力进行建设和巩固苏联武装部队的工作。由于在这方面作出了卓越的贡献，伏罗希洛夫同志在1935年获得了苏联第一个元帅的称号。在苏联伟大的卫国战争期间，伏罗希洛夫同志是最高国防委员会委员，参与了领导苏联军队击溃法西斯侵略者的工作。战后，伏罗希洛夫同志在苏联党和国家工作中继续担任了重要的职位。他对加强苏维埃国家的实力和苏联人民建设共产主义的事业作出了重要贡献，在苏联人民中间享有很高的威信。在去年访问苏联的日子里，我曾有机会同伏罗希洛夫同志和苏联其他国家领导人会见和接触。伏罗希洛夫同志平易近人和亲切真挚的态度，他对中国人民的深厚感情，给我留下了难忘的印象。这次我和我国人民能够有机会在我们的国土上欢迎这样一位年高德劭并且具有丰功伟绩的共产主义老战士，感到极大的兴奋和光荣。
    伏罗希洛夫同志作为苏联国家元首前来我国访问，是中苏两国人民亲如兄弟和牢不可破的友谊的充分证明，并且对这个友谊的进一步发展具有重大的意义。自从1950年2月14日中苏两国缔结伟大的兄弟同盟以来，我们两国在经济、政治和文化等各方面的友好合作，已一年比一年扩大和巩固了。在国际事务中，我们也为争取缓和国际紧张局势和促进国际合作而携手合作，共同努力。中苏两国八亿人民的这种团结一致和紧密合作，不但大大地增进了我们两国人民之间的相互了解和友谊，推动了两国社会主义建设和共产主义建设事业的前进，而且也成为维护世界和平和促进人类进步事业发展的一个最强大的因素。帝国主义侵略集团了解这个事实，并且像土拨鼠害怕太阳一样害怕这个事实，因此它们几年来总是像沙里淘金一样地企图在我们两国关系中发现一些即使是最微小的隙缝。帝国主义的宣传机关从来也没有放松在中苏关系的问题上进行挑拨的机会。但是对于他们来说，可悲的是，他们过去既没有成功，现在和将来也永远不会有成功的希望。中苏两国人民的团结之所以能够经受起一切考验，是因为我们的团结是建筑在牢不可破的基础之上，我们具有马克思列宁主义的共同思想，具有建设社会主义和共产主义的伟大的共同目标；同时我们是对八亿人民的切身利益和全人类进步事业的根本利益负责的。中苏两国人民的团结，是整个社会主义阵营团结的坚强核心。有了这个团结，我们就有力量克服一切前进途中的困难，就使和平和社会主义事业的胜利有了最可靠的保障。
    伏罗希洛夫同志这次来访我国，是苏联人民对我国人民的深情厚谊的生动表现，也是苏联对加强中苏两国友好关系和加强整个社会主义阵营团结的新的贡献。苏联是我国人民最亲密无私的朋友和我国社会主义建设的伟大援助者。我深信，我国人民将以最高的热情，来欢迎伏罗希洛夫同志来到我国访问，以此表示我们对苏联的感谢，表示对苏联人民情同手足的友谊，表示中苏两国人民永恒的、牢不可破的团结。
