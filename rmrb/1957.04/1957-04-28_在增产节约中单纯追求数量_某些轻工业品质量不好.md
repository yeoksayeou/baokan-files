Solely Pursuing Quantity in Production Increase and Thrift
　　Quality of Some Light Industrial Products is Poor

　　(This News) In the first quarter of the production increase and thrift campaign in the light industry and textile industry systems, although many enterprises completed their production increase tasks and improved quality, some enterprises neglected product quality while emphasizing production increases. For example, the proportion of first-grade first-class yarn in textile factories generally decreased, and the quality of first-grade second-class yarn was lower than in the fourth quarter of last year. In Liaoning, some textile factories reduced yarn count to save cotton, but the weft and warp of the cloth were not increased accordingly, resulting in thinner and sparser cloth, which even commercial departments were unwilling to accept. The East China Textile Industry Bureau reduced the yarn count of eighteen types of cotton cloth this year, of which twelve types did not increase the warp and weft accordingly. Some of these twelve types of cotton cloth are reasonable and do not affect quality; however, some affect quality. Some factories have increased the cotton knot impurities in the yarn, making the cloth woven from this yarn difficult to print and dye: the color of the cloth surface is dull and the printing and dyeing costs also increase. According to statistics from more than a dozen factories, the percentage of first-quality thermos bottles produced by the daily-use light industry system was 91.18% in January, 84.39% in February, and 85.7% in March. Other problems include rubber shoes opening, becoming sticky, discoloring, and the soles not being firm; enameled cups having cracks, etc. The Beijing Yanjing Paper Mill once reduced the quality of paper by inappropriately reducing the amount of reed pulp and increasing the amount of rice straw pulp. The Xuzhou Paper Mill was the first in the inter-factory competition in the same industry in Jiangsu Province last year, but the product quality in the first quarter of this year was greatly reduced.
　　There are many reasons for the decline in product quality. The poor quality of raw materials is one of them. For example, the white Lux shoes produced by the Beijing Rubber Factory are not as durable as before because the canvas surface is thin. However, the fact that the leading cadres of some enterprises see that the current products are in short supply, and only pay attention to saving in the production increase and thrift campaign, and do not pay attention to quality, is also a very important reason. Some people say: "It is not a loss to use less material, because there are always people who want it."
　　Based on the above situation, the person in charge of the Fourth Office of the State Council requested the leading comrades of the relevant industrial ministries to learn from the lessons of some enterprises neglecting product quality and causing waste in 1955, to earnestly overcome the idea of simply pursuing product quantity in the production increase and thrift campaign, and to summarize and promote the experience of both saving raw materials and ensuring product quality.

### 在增产节约中单纯追求数量  某些轻工业品质量不好

    在增产节约中单纯追求数量
    某些轻工业品质量不好
    本报讯　在第一季度轻工业、纺织工业系统增产节约运动中，虽然有许多企业完成了增产任务，质量也有所提高，但是，有些企业在强调增产的同时，忽视了产品质量。如纺织厂一等一级纱普遍减少，一等二级纱的质量比去年第四季度的低。辽宁有些纺织厂为节约用棉，纱支改细后，布的纬线、经线没相应增加，结果布变稀变薄，连商业部门都不愿要。华东纺织工业管理局今年改细十八种棉布的纱支，其中有十二种没有相应增加经线、纬线。在这十二种棉布里，有一部分是合理的，并不影响质量；但是有一部分却影响了质量。有些厂的纱的棉结杂质增加了，用这种纱织成的布不好印染：布面色泽暗淡无光，印染成本也提高。日用轻工业系统生产的保温瓶，据十几个厂的统计，1月份的正品率是91.18％，2月份是84.39％，3月份是85.7％。其他如胶鞋开胶、发粘、变色、大底不牢；搪瓷口杯有裂纹等等。北京燕京造纸厂曾经一度因不适当降低苇浆用量、增加稻草浆用量，使纸的质量下降。徐州造纸厂去年是江苏省同产业厂际竞赛的第一名，可是今年第一季度的产品质量却大大降低了。
    产品质量下降的原因很多。原料质量不好，是其中之一。如北京橡胶厂生产的白力士鞋，因为帆布面薄，做出来的鞋没有以前那样耐穿了。但是某些企业的领导干部看到目前产品供不应求，在增产节约运动中只注意节约，不注意质量，也是一个很重要的原因。有的人就说：“少用料并不吃亏，反正有人要”。
    根据以上情况，国务院第四办公室负责人要求有关工业部的领导同志必须吸取1955年有些企业忽视产品质量，造成浪费的教训，切实克服在增产节约中单纯追求产品数量的思想，总结和推广那些既能节约原材料，又能保证产品质量的经验。
