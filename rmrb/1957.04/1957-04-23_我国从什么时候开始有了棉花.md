In ancient China, the raw materials for people's clothing were initially silk, hemp, and kudzu. Cotton was not originally native to China; its introduction and cultivation have only a history of over 1300 years. According to the "Nanyue Zhi" written by Shen Huaiyuan during the Chen Dynasty of the Southern and Northern Dynasties (557-589 AD), and the biography of the Gaochang Kingdom in the "Nan Shi" written by Li Yanshou during the reign of Emperor Taizong of Tang Dynasty (627-650 AD), cotton was cultivated in Guilin, Guangxi, Dali, Yunnan, and the Turpan area of Xinjiang in the south of China during the sixth and seventh centuries. Only at the end of the Song Dynasty and the beginning of the Yuan Dynasty did cotton spread to the provinces south of the Yangtze River. During the reign of Emperor Shizu of Yuan, "Wood Cotton Tribute Offices" were established in eastern Zhejiang, eastern Jiangxi, Jiangxi, Huguang, Fujian, and other places. During the Ming Dynasty, cotton gradually became popular in the Yangtze River Basin and the Yellow River Basin. During the reign of Emperor Taizu of Ming (1368-1399), it was decreed that "families with five to ten mu of farmland should plant half a mu each of mulberry, hemp, and cotton, and those with more than ten mu should double that amount." It can be seen that from the thirteenth to fourteenth centuries, cotton had become an important economic crop in China.

The earliest cotton seeds introduced into China were African cotton and Asian cotton. African cotton, also known as herbaceous cotton, was transmitted from Arabia through Central Asia to the northwestern provinces of China. Because of its low yield, it did not achieve large-scale expansion. There is still a very small amount of cultivation in the Hexi Corridor of Xinjiang and Gansu. Asian cotton was transmitted from India to the southwestern provinces of China, and later spread throughout the country from the Jiangnan region. Because Asian cotton was introduced early and popularized for planting throughout the country, it was later called Zhongmian (Chinese cotton). The coarse cotton currently grown in some cotton-producing areas of China is this type of cotton. The introduction of upland cotton (also known as fine cotton) has a history of less than sixty years, with trial planting beginning only in 1898. Due to the high yield and good quality of upland cotton, it gradually replaced Zhongmian. More than 90% of the cotton fields in the country now grow upland cotton. In addition, in Yunnan, Guangdong, Fujian, Hainan Island and other places, there are also perennial tree cotton belonging to the sea island cotton type, but it has not yet been investigated when it was introduced. After liberation, the trial planting of annual sea island cotton has also been successful in Xinjiang, Yunnan, Hainan Island and other places.

Although the introduction and planting of cotton in China was later than other major crops, Chinese farmers have accumulated rich experience in cotton planting in long-term production practice. The cotton planting experiences recorded in ancient agricultural books such as "Nongsang Jiyao" by Meng Qi of the Yuan Dynasty six hundred years ago, Wang Zhen's "Book of Agriculture," "Complete Treatise on Agriculture" by Xu Guangqi of the Ming Dynasty three hundred years ago, and Fang Guancheng's "Imperial Inscription Cotton Illustrations" (1765 AD) during the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty are generally consistent with some of the advanced cotton planting techniques that we are promoting now, based on scientific principles. These cotton planting experiences have been passed down from generation to generation, and with the farmers' development and creation in hard work and practice, they have gathered into the rich cotton planting experiences of the old farmers. In improving cotton planting technology, we must attach importance to China's original cotton planting experience and learn from experienced old farmers.

    我国从什么时候开始有了棉花
    杨树藩
    我国古代人民的衣被原料，最早是应用丝、麻和葛。棉花本来不是我国原产，引进种植只有一千三百多年的历史。根据南北朝陈朝（公元557—589年）沈怀远著“南越志”和唐太宗时（公元627—650年）李延寿著“南史”高昌国传记载，在六、七世纪的时候，在我国南方的广西桂林、云南大理和西方的新疆吐鲁番一带，栽培了棉花。宋末元初的时候，棉花才传播到长江以南各省，元世祖曾在浙东、江东、江西、湖广、福建等地，设立“木棉提奉司”。明朝，棉花逐渐普及到长江流域和黄河流域；明太祖时（公元1368—1399年），曾下令规定“民田五亩至十亩者，栽桑、麻、棉各半亩，十亩以上者倍之。”可见，在十三世纪到十四世纪，棉花已经成为我国的重要经济作物。
    最早传到我国的棉种是非洲棉和亚洲棉。非洲棉又叫草棉，是自阿拉伯经中央亚细亚传到我国西北各省的；因为产量很低，没有得到大的扩展，现在新疆和甘肃的河西还有极少量的栽培。亚洲棉是自印度传到我国西南各省的，后来又由江南传遍全国。因为亚洲棉传入早，又普及到全国各地种植，后来就叫它中棉。现在我国有些棉区种植的粗绒棉，就是这种棉。陆地棉（又叫细绒棉）的引进，还不到六十年的历史，1898年才开始输入试种。由于陆地棉的产量高、品质好，逐渐代替了中棉。现在全国棉田面积的90％以上，种的是陆地棉。另外，在云南、广东、福建、海南岛等地，还有属于海岛棉类型的多年生木棉，是什么时候传入的，还没有考察出来。解放以后，在新疆、云南、海南岛等地，试种一年生的海岛棉也已经成功。
    我国棉花的引进种植虽然比其他主要的农作物较晚，但是，我国农民在长期生产实践中也积累了丰富的植棉经验。远在六百年前的元朝孟祺著“农桑辑要”、王祯农书和三百年前明朝徐光启著“农政全书”、清乾隆时方观承的“御题棉花图”（公元1765年）等古代农书上记载的植棉经验，从科学道理上分析，同现在我们推行的一些先进植棉技术比较，大体都是符合的。这些植棉经验，世代相传，再加上农民们在辛勤劳动实践中的发挥创造，就汇集成了老农们的丰富的植棉经验。我们在改进植棉技术中，必须重视我国原有的植棉经验，向经验丰富的老农学习。
