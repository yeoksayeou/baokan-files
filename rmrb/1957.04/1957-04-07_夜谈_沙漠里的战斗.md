    Night Talk on "Battle in the Desert"
    Liang Ruhuai

    My friend and I came out of the night showing of "Battle in the Desert." Walking on the street, the spring night wind blew in our faces. Although it carried some sand and dust, it was mostly warm. It seemed we should talk about something else, but we couldn't contain our excitement, and continued talking about the film all the way.

    "The development of the story in this film was beyond my expectations," my friend began.

    I understood what he meant. He probably thought it would be another story about the People's Liberation Army helping ethnic minorities suppress bandits and strengthen national unity. But "Battle in the Desert" did not follow that ready-made formula to arrange the characters' fates. It unfolded a brand new picture before us: a magnificent scene of socialist construction projects in the border regions. What faced those heroes was the vast, boundless desert, the frozen mountains for thousands of miles, and the dry, withered land. Here, the heroes overcame numerous obstacles and broke through countless difficulties, working with the people of all ethnic groups in the border regions to allow the flowers of socialism to bloom in the great desert. This is a new theme, new characters, and a new story. This is what makes us particularly interested.

    Of course, between the exploration team leader Yang Fa and the engineer Li Hui, there also seemed to be a conflict between advanced and backward thinking that we are very familiar with, but that did not form a real contradiction. Once Li Hui came into contact with reality, he changed his conservative approach, learned from books. The playwright is faithful to the laws of life itself. There is no artificial "highlighting" of this "contradiction," which is where it doesn't fall into cliché. What blocks our heroes is the icy peak where "thousands of mountains have no birds flying, and ten thousand paths have no human footprints;" what surges in their hearts is the loyalty to building the border regions and the fearless heroic spirit. It is in this kind of realistic portrayal that we see how life advances with its extraordinary pace, and how people conquer nature and become its masters.

    In particular, the scenes where the exploration team was trapped in the earthen fortress by the storm were indeed unforgettable. Could we, who live in the city and in the interior, even imagine the hard life in those remote places?

    So we talked about many poems that rendered the lives of the exploration personnel too beautifully, to the point of arousing criticism from those involved. The pages were full of high mountains and flowing water, playing music and singing songs, resembling a group of carefree hiking students. In comparison, what is depicted in this film is closer to reality.

    When talking about technician Zhang Zhen, my friend's voice became even more enthusiastic.

    Indeed, these young citizens full of enthusiasm and lofty aspirations were only praised in the poets' passionate poems and depicted in the painters' bright canvases in the past. It seems that this is the first time they have appeared on the screen. We see the young girl who just walked out of school, carrying a canvas bag, coming to the border region with such heroic steps. She was a little timid at first; however, quickly, her enthusiasm, her fantasies, were attached to the arduous, selfless labor.

    We also talked about Li Hui. Frankly, our dislike for this character is not because he is backward, but because this character himself seems to have appeared only to play a backward role. He lacks individuality. What is he thinking? What does he think about the people and things around him? We don't know at all. He doesn't have less opportunities than the division commander, yet our understanding of this person is still limited to a symbol.

    Talking about the second half of the film, we always felt a little unenthusiastic. My friend asked:

    "Why do you say Yang Fa insisted on going up the mountain after the team was scattered by the flood?"

    This is an interesting question, but I couldn't answer it. Yes, why? At that time, it could already be judged that there must be a water source on the mountain, and the road to the mountain had also been found. Besides, Yang Fa could also think of what his and Little Zhu's disappearance would bring to the division headquarters, how many people would be sent out to find them (didn't they even mobilize the air force?). Moreover, more importantly, Little Zhu was right: "This is still different from fighting a war... If we can't go up today, there's still tomorrow. Anyway, the ice peak won't run away!" However, Yang Fa insisted on going up. He was already physically exhausted, but he still insisted on going up (what if he fell on the ice mountain? This possibility is not small); even without an engineer or cartographer by his side, he still insisted on going up. This is really incomprehensible. Is it really like he said, "How can I face people when I go back like this?" My friend said that this is probably to show the strong will of the people's soldiers? But I can't quite understand it. Not bowing to difficulties and thinking of ways to overcome them counts as a brave man; is it really necessary to fight hard alone?

    Because of this incident, two more questions arose: First, when we saw Yang Fa and Little Zhu climbing up the ice peak with difficulty, and the division commander leading a group of people to find them, why didn't it cause too much excitement? The audience at this time had also determined that a water source would definitely be found, and had already begun to wait for the happy ending. Second, since the air force could find the climbers, it didn't seem difficult to find out whether there was a large lake on the top of the mountain—the object that Yang Fa and the others risked their lives to explore.

    Of course, it is easy for us to talk about it. Maybe without these, there would be no drama. However, this is indeed where we feel unsatisfied with the second half of the film, where we feel that Yang Fa's heroic character has been damaged.

    As we talked, we realized we were almost home. At this time, we suddenly felt that taking a walk on the streets on a spring night is a real enjoyment. For this reason alone, we should thank those who are breaking ground and thorns in the remote border regions, creating more happiness for the motherland. (Attached picture)

### 夜谈“沙漠里的战斗”

    夜谈“沙漠里的战斗”
    梁汝怀
    我和我的朋友看完夜场的“沙漠里的战斗”出来。走到街上，春夜的风迎面吹来，虽是夹着些沙土，更多的却是温暖。好像应该谈点别的，然而我们止不住激动的心情，一路还是谈着这部影片。
    “这影片故事的发展，大出我的意外。”我的朋友开始说。
    我懂得他的意思。他大概把它想成仍旧是解放军帮助少数民族剿匪，增强了民族团结。可是“沙漠里的战斗”没有按照那个现成的公式来安排人物的命运。它在我们面前展开了一幅崭新的图景：在边疆进行社会主义建设工程的宏伟的画面。在那些英雄面前的，是广阔无垠的沙漠，千里冰封的山峰，干旱枯萎的土地。英雄们在这里克服重重障碍，突破重重困难，同边疆各族人民一起，让大沙漠里开放社会主义的花朵。这里是新的主题，新的人物，新的故事。这就是使我们特别感觉兴趣的原因。
    当然，在勘察队长杨发同工程师李辉之间，好像也有一种我们很熟悉的先进思想同落后思想的冲突，但那并没有形成真正的矛盾。李辉一接触到实际，也就改变了他的保守的、从书本上搬来的认识方法了。剧作者忠实于生活本身的规律，没有人为地“突出”这个“矛盾”，正是不落俗套的地方。横阻在我们的英雄前面的，是“千山鸟飞绝、万径人踪灭”的冰峰；荡漾在他们心头的，是建设边疆的忠忱和大无畏的英雄气概。就在这种真实的描绘里，我们看到了生活怎样以它不平凡的步伐前进，看到人们怎样征服自然，成为它的主人。
    特别是勘察队被暴风困在土堡里的那几场描写，确实使我们久久难忘。在那些遥远的地方的艰苦生活，难道是我们这些住在城市、住在内地的人能够想像得到的吗？
    于是我们就谈到不少的诗歌，把勘察人员的生活渲染得过于美好了，以至引起那些当事人本人的责难。满纸都是高山流水，弹琴唱歌，倒像是一群无忧无虑的远足的学生了。比起来，这部影片里所描写的，就更接近真实一些。
    说到技术员张珍的时候，我的朋友的声音更加昂扬了。
    真的，这些满腔热情、满怀壮志的青年公民，过去仅仅在诗人的热情洋溢的诗篇里歌颂过他们，在画家的鲜艳的画幅上描绘过他们，至于在银幕上出现，似乎还是头一次。那个刚走出校门，背个帆布包袱来到边疆的青年姑娘，我们看见她跨着多么豪迈的步子。开始还有点胆怯；然而，很快的，她的热情，她的幻想，都附丽在艰苦的、忘我的劳动上了。
    我们也谈到李辉。坦白说，我们对这人物的不喜爱，倒不是因为他落后，而是因为这人物本身好像就是为了扮演一个落后的角色才出现的。他缺乏个性。他究竟想些什么？对周围的人和事怎么看法？我们全不知道。他出现的机会并不比师长少，然而我们对这人的认识，还是止于一个符号。
    谈到影片的后半部，我们总觉得有点不大带劲。我的朋友问：
    “你说，被大水冲散了队伍以后，为什么杨发还要坚持上山？”
    这倒是个有趣的问题，可是我回答不出。是呀，为了什么呢？当时已经可以判断山上一定有水源，上山的路也找到了。再说，杨发也能想得到，他同小朱的失踪会给师部带来些什么，要派多少人出来找他们（不是吗？甚至于动员了空军）。而且，更重要的，小朱说得对：“这和打仗还是不一样啊……，今天上不去，还有明天。反正冰峰总跑不了！”然而，杨发硬是要上。体力已经支持不住了，还是要上（万一在冰山上倒下了，怎么办？这个可能性并不小）；没有工程员、绘图员在身边，也还是要上。这真不知道为什么了。难道真是像他自己说的“这样回去有脸见人吗”？我的朋友说，这大约是为了表现人民战士的坚强意志吧？可是我想不大通。在困难面前不低头，并且想出办法来克服困难算得勇士；单枪匹马硬拼命，难道真有这种必要吗？
    由于这件事，又引起了两个疑问：第一，当我们看到杨发和小朱在冰峰上困难地往上爬、师长带着一群人来找他们的时候，为什么并没有引起太大的激动？观众们这时候也已经断定一定会找到水源，并且已经开始等待大团圆的结局了。第二，空军既然能发现爬山的人，似乎也不难发现山顶上有没有大湖——即杨发他们冒生命危险去探求的对象。
    自然，我们说说是很容易的。也许，没有这些，也就没有什么戏了。可是，这的确是我们对影片的后半部感到不能满足的地方，感到杨发的英雄性格受到损伤的地方。
    说着说着，不觉快到家了。这时，我们才蓦然感觉到，在春夜的街头散步，真是一种享受。就为这个，也该感谢那些在遥远的边疆披荆斩棘、为祖国创造更多的幸福的人们。（附图片）
