Chairman Voroshilov's Speech

Dear Chairman Mao Zedong! Dear comrades!

We have been in your beautiful country for three days already. But we have not had the chance to go to more places, and have not seen enough of the rich and colorful life of China. But we all know that China is the birthplace of ancient civilization and one of the cradles of human culture. Everyone knows that China is a vast country with abundant resources, and most importantly, the people living in this country are hundreds of millions of outstanding people. The whole world knows that the talented Chinese people love labor, possess inherent humility, a spirit of perseverance and great wisdom.

We know that before embarking on the broad road of building socialism, the Chinese people endured great hardships and suffered cruel oppression from feudalism and imperialism. Inspired by the victory of the October Socialist Revolution in our country, the glorious Chinese Communist Party led the Chinese people onto this correct path of building socialism.

The Chinese Communist Party, using the theory of Marxism-Leninism as its ideological weapon, has become a great force capable of uniting the great Chinese people. After arduous battles, the Chinese people defeated the enemy and established their own people's democratic state—the People's Republic of China.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese people have achieved remarkable successes in all aspects of peaceful economic and cultural construction.

In a very short period of time, the Chinese people restored the national economy that had been destroyed during the rule of the interventionists and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Today, the Chinese people are working with great enthusiasm to realize their first Five-Year Plan, and the entire plan is nearing completion, with the industrial plan already completed and overfulfilled.

You—our Chinese friends—have victoriously completed the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce and handicrafts. In this way, the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese People's Government have brilliantly solved one of the most difficult revolutionary tasks, and have enriched the treasure trove of Marxism-Leninism with their practical experience.

The Soviet people are also clearly aware of the achievements made by the People's Republic of China in the socialist transformation of agriculture. It is amazing that the Chinese peasants, who were oppressed by landlords, bureaucratic bourgeoisie, and foreign capital in the past, have traveled a very long road in five or six years, voluntarily joined production cooperatives, and mostly joined production cooperatives of a completely socialist nature!

We Soviet people who are on a friendly visit to China feel very fortunate because we can see your achievements with our own eyes, understand the various conditions under which the Chinese people are carrying out large-scale work, see how the Chinese people overcome difficulties, and how they strive to turn the ancient motherland into a socialist industrial power and continuously improve the people's lives.

The fact that the Chinese people have achieved many victories in building socialism, in peaceful and creative labor, is an indisputable fact. Even the enemy cannot deny this fact. Your achievements can only make friends of peace and socialism feel gratified and encouraged.

This is understandable, because the strengthening of the strength of the People's China is also the strengthening of the strength of the entire socialist camp. And the socialist camp, as the people of all countries are increasingly clearly seeing, is the embodiment and defender of the brilliant ideas of human peace and progress. The more victoriously we move forward, the more we prove that the ideas of socialism and world peace will ultimately triumph over all the conspiracies of the imperialists. We are convinced that one day the people of the whole world will be able to engage in peaceful labor and live a peaceful and happy life. Now hundreds of millions of people in many countries of the world share the same belief as us.

The People's Republic of China, together with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, as well as other peace-loving countries, is waging an unyielding struggle for peace. We are told that there is a Chinese saying: "Mount Tai does not reject soil, so it can achieve its height." The People's Republic of China, like this legendary mountain, never rejects any proposal aimed at easing international tensions. On the contrary, China's efforts to seek international peace are well known throughout the world. Anyone who has not lost his mind due to hatred of mankind will fully understand that without the participation of the People's Republic of China, major international issues, especially those related to the Far East and Asia, cannot be resolved. We believe that one day, even the stubborn groups in some capitalist countries will see and understand this.

Dear Comrades! The victory of the Chinese revolution and your achievements in peaceful socialist construction have been achieved under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party, which now has 12 million members. The Chinese Communist Party has always been the organizer and inspirer of the long-term struggle of the entire Chinese people to overthrow the rule of domestic and foreign reactionaries. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Communist Party has united people from all walks of life and various democratic parties, and led the people towards new victories in socialist construction. Communists all over the world are carefully studying the great contributions made by the Chinese Communist Party in studying the theory and practice of Marxism-Leninism. The Soviet Communist Party and the entire Soviet people are filled with respect for the wise Chinese Communist Party, for Comrade Mao Zedong, the long-tested leader of the Chinese Communist Party and the entire Chinese people, and for his outstanding comrades-in-arms.

We Soviet people are happy about the victories achieved by the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese People's Government in their work, and we sincerely hope that you will achieve more success in your work for the happiness of the Chinese people.

The Soviet people love and respect our close and talented Chinese people. We are very satisfied that the friendship between our two peoples has a long tradition.

This is understandable, because the Russian and Chinese peoples are neighbors, and they have been developing political, economic and cultural ties for centuries.

The historical destinies of the Russian and Chinese peoples have many similarities. Both of our countries have been subjected to foreign aggression more than once, and have waged resolute struggles for their national independence. The Russian and Chinese peoples suffered under the cruel feudal monarchical system for many centuries, and more than once took up arms to fight for their liberation.

For decades, advanced figures in Russia and China have unremittingly sought ways to overcome the serious backwardness caused by the rule of their own exploiters, eliminate all oppression, and open up a path to a free and happy life for the working people.

All this naturally determined the development of friendship between our two peoples. Many outstanding figures in Russia and China have strived to promote the union of the two countries in order to realize the long-cherished wishes of their own people. As early as the beginning of the 20th century, the talented Russian scientist Mendeleev predicted: "I believe that the union of Russia and China, if not the best guarantee for the peaceful progress of the two countries and even the whole world, is also the most reliable and fundamental guarantee."

The Russian working people have always had deep sympathy for the Chinese people's heroic liberation struggle and have given it moral support. On the other hand, we also know and remember that the Chinese people also have great sympathy for the revolutionary actions of the Russian workers. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, what unites our two peoples is an infinitely glorious goal: to build a socialist society and further build a complete communist society. Today, what guides us forward and unites us is the immortal thought of Marxism-Leninism, and what inspires us is the common lofty aspiration to realize human peace and progress. Precisely because of this, peace-loving people of all countries and all those who consider issues realistically regard our friendship and our alliance as the most reliable guarantee for the peaceful development of mankind. The people of all countries now place their hopes on us, and will continue to place their hopes on us in the future, because they know from experience that the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China defend their legitimate interests.

I would like to take this lucky opportunity to once again declare that the Soviet people have infinite love and friendship for the 600 million Chinese people.

We know that the Chinese people cherish friendship very much and regard friendship as the most precious emotion of mankind. In China, people call their close friends brothers. This good habit is also reflected in the relationship between our two peoples. Our two peoples cherish this inspiring and invincible brotherhood. In the friendly family of our socialist countries, we are all equal and close brothers. There is no closer relationship than ours, neither in the past nor now.

Comrade Mao Zedong, I sincerely thank you and other comrades for the enthusiastic words you expressed to me at this reception and during my stay in Beijing. I fully attribute all your compliments to me to the Soviet people I represent.

Dear friends, please allow me to propose a toast to our great brotherly friendship, to the prosperity of the People's Republic of China, to the prosperity of the talented and powerful Chinese people, to the government of the Chinese people and the glorious Chinese Communist Party, to the health of all leaders of the People's Republic of China, and to the health and longevity of Chairman Mao Zedong!

### 伏罗希洛夫主席的讲话

    伏罗希洛夫主席的讲话亲爱的毛泽东主席！亲爱的同志们！
    我们到你们美丽的国家已经三天了。但是我们还没有来得及到更多的地方去，对于中国的丰富多采的生活看的还不多。可是我们都知道中国是古代文明的发源地，是人类文化的摇篮之一。大家都知道，中国是一个地大物博的国家，而最重要的是，生活在这个国家里的人民是几万万非常出色的人民。全世界都知道天才的中国人民热爱劳动，具有天生的谦虚、刚毅坚忍的精神和巨大的智慧。
    我们知道，中国人民在走上建设社会主义的康庄大道以前，忍受了巨大的艰难困苦，遭受了封建主义和帝国主义的残酷压迫。受到我国十月社会主义革命胜利鼓舞的光荣的中国共产党引导中国人民走上了这条正确的建设社会主义的道路。
    用马克思列宁主义的理论作为思想武器的中国共产党，已经成为足以能够团结伟大中国人民的巨大力量。中国人民经过艰苦的战斗，打败了敌人，并且建立了自己的人民民主国家——中华人民共和国。
    中华人民共和国成立以后，中国人民在和平的经济建设和文化建设的各个方面都取得了卓越的成就。
    中国人民用了极短的一段时间，就恢复了在干涉者和国民党反动派统治时期被破坏了的国民经济。今天，中国人民正以极大的热情为实现自己的第一个五年计划而努力，现在整个这个计划正接近完成，而且工业方面的计划已经完成和超额完成了。
    你们——我们的中国朋友——胜利地完成了私营工商业和手工业的社会主义改造。这样，中国共产党和中国人民政府就天才地解决了一项最艰难的革命任务，并且以自己的实际经验丰富了马克思列宁主义的宝库。
    苏联人民也清楚地知道中华人民共和国在农业的社会主义改造方面所取得的成就。过去受着地主、官僚资产阶级和外国资本的压迫的中国农民在五、六年内就走完了一条极长的道路，自愿地加入了生产合作社，并且多半是加入了完全社会主义性质的生产合作社，这样的事情不能不令人惊异！
    我们这些到中国作友好访问的苏联人都感到非常的幸运，因为我们能亲眼看到你们的成就，了解到中国人民借以进行大规模工作的各种条件，看到中国人民怎样克服困难，怎样努力使古老的祖国变成一个社会主义的工业强国，并且使人民生活不断得到改善。
    中国人民在建设社会主义的、和平的、创造性的劳动中取得了许多胜利，这是无可置辩的事实。甚至敌人也不能抹杀这个事实。你们的成就使和平和社会主义的朋友们只能感到欣慰和鼓舞。
    这是可以理解的，因为人民中国的力量的增强，同时也就是整个社会主义阵营的实力的加强。而社会主义阵营，正像各国人民愈来愈清楚地看到的那样，是人类和平和进步的光辉思想的体现者和捍卫者。我们愈是胜利地前进，就愈加证明社会主义和世界和平的思想最终必将战胜帝国主义者的一切阴谋诡计。我们确信，全世界人民终将有一天都能从事和平的劳动，过太平幸福的生活。现在世界各国好多万万的人都和我们怀着同样的信心。
    中华人民共和国同苏联和其他社会主义国家以及其他爱好和平的国家一道，为和平进行着不屈不挠的斗争。有人告诉我们说，中国有一句成语：“泰山不让土壤故能成其高”。中华人民共和国正像这座有着许多传说的大山一样，从不拒绝任何一个旨在和缓国际紧张局势的建议。相反地，中国为寻求国际和平而做出的努力，在全世界是人所共知的。任何一个人，只要还没有因仇视人类而失去理智，他就会十分懂得，没有中华人民共和国的参加，重大的国际问题，特别是有关远东和亚洲的问题就不能解决。我们认为，总有一天，甚至某些资本主义国家的顽固集团也将会看到和了解这一点。
    亲爱的同志们！中国革命的胜利和你们从事和平的社会主义建设的成就，都是在目前已经拥有一千二百万党员的光荣的中国共产党的领导下取得的。中国共产党一直是全中国人民为推翻国内外反动派的统治而进行的长期斗争的组织者和鼓舞者。中华人民共和国成立以后，共产党把各阶层人民、各民主党派团结在一起，领导人民向着社会主义建设的新的胜利前进。全世界的共产党人正在仔细研究中国共产党人在研讨马克思列宁主义的理论和实践方面所作出的巨大贡献。苏联共产党人和苏联全体人民对于英明的中国共产党，对于中国共产党和全中国人民的久经考验的领袖毛泽东同志和他的卓越的战友充满了敬意。
    我们苏联人对于中国共产党和中国人民政府在工作中所取得的胜利感到高兴，我们衷心地希望你们为了中国人民的幸福在工作中取得更多的成就。
    苏联人热爱并且尊敬我们所亲近的有才能的中国人民。我们非常满意我们两国人民的友谊有着悠久的传统。
    这是可以理解的，因为俄国人民和中国人民是邻居，他们发展政治、经济和文化联系已有几百年之久了。
    俄国人民和中国人民在历史上的命运有着很多相同的地方。我们两国都不止一次地受过外来的侵略，都为自己的民族独立进行过坚决的斗争。俄国人民和中国人民曾有许多世纪受着残酷的封建君主制度的压迫，并且不止一次地拿起武器为自己的解放而奋斗。
    俄国和中国的先进人物曾经在几十年的过程中不屈不挠地寻求出路，想要克服本国剥削者的统治所造成的严重落后状况，消灭一切压迫，并且给劳动人民自由幸福的生活开辟道路。
    这一切自然而然地确定了我们两国人民的友情的发展。俄国和中国的许多优秀人物，为了实现本国人民的宿愿，力图促成两国的联合。还在二十世纪的初期，天才的俄国科学家门德雷叶夫就曾预言说：“我认为，俄国和中国的联合对于两国的以至全世界的和平进步来说，即使不是最好的保证，也是最可靠和最基本的保证。”
    俄国劳动人民对中国人民英勇的解放斗争一向怀着深切的同情，并且给以道义上的支持。另一方面，我们也知道并且记得，中国人民对俄国劳动者的革命行动也同样寄予巨大的同情。中华人民共和国成立以后，把我们两国人民联合在一起的是一个无比光辉的目标，这就是：建设社会主义社会和进一步建设完全的共产主义社会。今天，引导我们前进和把我们团结起来的是不朽的马克思列宁主义思想，鼓舞着我们的是实现人类和平和进步的这一共同的崇高愿望。正因为这样，爱好和平的各国人民和一切现实地考虑问题的人都把我们的友谊和我们的同盟看作是人类和平发展的最可靠的保证。各国人民现在都把希望寄托在我们身上，而且今后还会把希望寄托在我们身上，因为他们根据经验知道苏联和中华人民共和国捍卫着他们的正当利益。
    我愿意利用这次幸运的机会，再次声明苏联人民对六亿中国人民是怀着无限的热爱和友情的。
    我们知道，中国人民非常珍视友谊，把友谊看做人类最宝贵的感情。在中国，人们把自己的亲密朋友叫做兄弟。这种良好的习惯也反映在我们两国人民的关系上，我们两国人民都珍视这一鼓舞人心的和战无不胜的兄弟情谊。在我们社会主义国家的友好大家庭里，我们都是平等相处、亲密无间的兄弟。没有比我们的关系更紧密的了，过去没有，现在也没有。
    毛泽东同志，对您和其他同志在这次招待会上和我在北京逗留期间对我表达的热情的话，我衷心地表示感谢。您一切称赞我的话，我完全归功于我所代表的苏联人民。
    亲爱的朋友们，请允许我为我们伟大的兄弟友谊，为中华人民共和国的繁荣，为天才的强大的中国人民的繁荣，为中国人民的政府和光荣的中国共产党，为中华人民共和国所有领导者的健康，为毛泽东主席的健康和长寿，干杯！
