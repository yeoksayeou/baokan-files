Jiangsu Sends Nearly 20,000 Cadres to the Countryside
Uniting Grassroots Cadres to Lead the Masses in Setting an Example of Hard Work and Plain Living

(According to Xinhua Daily News) Jiangsu Province has transferred 19,604 cadres (including 5,501 cadres transferred to the townships) to the counties, townships, and cooperatives. Among them are 56 responsible cadres transferred from the provincial and prefectural committees, including Deputy Director of the Provincial Rural Work Department Dai Meng, Deputy Director of the Provincial Planning Commission Li Zhong, Deputy Director of the Provincial Forestry Department Du Wenbai, Deputy Director of the Aquatic Products Department Hu Diannan, Deputy Secretary of the Huaiyin Prefectural Committee Wang Zhanzhi, and Deputy Secretary of the Nantong Prefectural Committee Yang Ping, who were transferred to counties to serve as secretaries and deputy secretaries of the county committees; 2,948 county and district cadres were appointed as secretaries of township Party committees; and 5,463 county and district committee cadres were appointed as secretaries of cooperative branches.

Since these cadres were sent down, they have actively worked and enthusiastically helped the masses solve difficulties, which has strongly promoted spring plowing and production and the rectification of cooperatives. In the Xuzhou area, in the past, when some district committees held meetings of branch secretaries, the entrances were lined with their bicycles, but now, when meetings are held, the entrances are filled with manure baskets. The masses said, "We can't complain anymore; even the district head is carrying a manure basket now, so how can we not do a good job in production?" After the cadres sent down to Feng County arrived in the townships and cooperatives, they universally carried manure baskets, leading the masses to accumulate fertilizer, thus setting off a county-wide upsurge in fertilizer accumulation. In Jihé Township, Funing County, after the Spring Festival, the production enthusiasm of the cooperative members was not high. Now, under the leadership of the transferred cadres, all 18 cooperative directors and production team leaders in the township have participated in production, which has encouraged the production enthusiasm of the cooperative members. On the first day that the cadres in the cooperatives participated in production, they motivated 452 laborers to engage in production, applying 3,570 boats of mud, more than 5,000 loads of ash, and more than 6,800 loads of liquid fertilizer to the fields within five days, and digging a 4,800 cubic meter ditch within seven days. In Yaotang Township, Jintan County, some people originally lacked confidence in running the cooperatives well. This time, seven cadres were sent down to the township, strengthening the leadership and taking the lead in production. The enthusiasm of the masses soared, and a high tide of spring plowing and production formed throughout the township. The cooperative members said, "Cadres being sent down makes the cooperative members happy, production is done well, and a bumper harvest is in sight."

Among the sent-down cadres, there are also some problems that urgently need to be solved. In some areas, most of the sent-down cadres have not been assigned positions, so they are not very settled in their work; a few cadres, after going down, do not have a harmonious relationship with the original grassroots cadres, seeing less of the advantages and work achievements of the original grassroots cadres and more of their shortcomings; and there are also individual sent-down cadres who lack the style of hard work and plain living.

At present, all localities are conducting inspections and summaries of the work of the first batch of sent-down cadres according to the spirit of the Provincial Party Committee's organizational work conference, and are actively preparing for the second batch of cadres to be sent down.

### 江苏近两万干部下放农村  团结基层干部带领群众树立了艰苦朴素的榜样

    江苏近两万干部下放农村
    团结基层干部带领群众树立了艰苦朴素的榜样
    本报讯　据新华日报消息：江苏全省已抽调一万九千六百零四名干部（包括五千五百零一名下放到社的乡干部），下放到县、乡和合作社。其中有自省、地委抽调出来的省委农村工作部副部长戴盟、省计划委员会副主任李忠、省林业厅副厅长杜文白、水产厅副厅长胡奠南、淮阴地委副书记王占志、南通地委副书记杨萍等五十六名负责干部，下放到县任县委正副书记；有二千九百四十八名县区干部任乡党委书记；有五千四百六十三名县区委干部任合作社支部书记。
    这批干部下放以后，由于他们积极工作，热情的帮助群众解决困难，有力地推动了春耕生产和整社运动。徐州地区过去有些区委开支部书记会议时，门口排满了他们的脚踏车，现在开会时，门口摆满了粪筐。群众说：“再说怪话不行了，现在连区长都背上粪筐了，我们还能不好好的搞生产吗？”丰县的下放干部到乡、社以后，普遍的背起粪筐，带动群众进行积肥，因而掀起了全县性的积肥高潮。阜宁县沟墩区集合乡集合社，春节以后社员生产情绪不高，现在在下放干部的带头下，全乡十八个社长和生产队长都参加了生产，鼓舞了社员的生产热情。在社干部参加生产的第一天，就带动了四百五十二个劳动力投入生产，在五天内将三千五百七十船泥、五千多担灰、六千八百多担水肥，全部追下田，在七天内开好了一条四千八百方土的水沟。金坛县尧塘乡有八个农业社，原来有些人对办好合作社信心不高。这次有七个干部下放到该乡，加强了领导，带头搞生产后，群众情绪高涨，全乡春耕生产形成高潮。社员说：“干部下放，社员高兴，生产搞好，丰收有望。”
    在下放干部中也有一些问题亟待解决。有些地区下放的干部多数没有定职，因此工作不太安心；有少数干部下去以后，与原来的基层干部关系不够融洽，对原来基层干部的优点和工作成绩看得少，缺点看得多；也有个别的下放干部，缺乏艰苦朴素的作风。
    目前，各地正根据省委组织工作会议精神，进行检查总结第一批下放干部工作，并积极准备第二批干部下放工作。
