Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 23rd: The news of Chairman Mao Zedong's meeting with the Japanese Socialist Party Goodwill Delegation to China, the content of their talks, and the joint statement issued by Zhang Xiruo and Inejiro Asanuma have caused great repercussions in Japanese newspapers and among people from all walks of life. Suzuki Mosaburo, Chairman of the Japanese Socialist Party, said yesterday evening that the joint statement issued by Zhang Xiruo and Inejiro Asanuma proves that if not subjected to external pressure, and if China and Japan sincerely negotiate, nothing can prevent the two countries from restoring diplomatic relations.

He said that the Japanese Socialist Party Goodwill Delegation to China fully consulted with Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai on the basic principles for striving for the normalization of diplomatic relations between China and Japan and on various current transitional issues, and reached a consensus. He believes this is the greatest achievement. He pointed out that the joint statement fully conforms to the wishes of the people of Asia, including the people of China and Japan, who stand for independence and freedom and hope for peace and friendship.

Sanzo Nosaka, First Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, pointed out that the joint statement is of epoch-making significance to the Japanese people who urgently hope to realize the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan as soon as possible. He expressed the hope that the Japanese Socialist Party will strive for the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan in accordance with the principles specified in the joint statement. He pointed out that in order to achieve this goal, the Japanese Socialist Party must join hands with the Japanese Communist Party and all democratic forces to fight against the forces that attempt to hinder the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan.

Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirohide Ishida stated that the joint statement only abstractly pointed out the direction of Sino-Japanese friendship, so he has no objections.

Takeo Miki, Secretary-General of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party of Japan, believes that the joint statement stating that Taiwan is China's internal affair and advocating the establishment of a collective peace guarantee treaty including the United States and the Soviet Union is "too detached from reality."

In recent days, Japanese newspapers have been reporting on the activities of the Japanese Socialist Party Goodwill Delegation to China with great length every day.

    日本进步力量力争中日建交
    铃木野坂等欢迎共同声明
    据新华社23日讯　东京消息：毛泽东主席接见日本社会党访华亲善使节团的消息和谈话内容以及张奚若和浅沼稻次郎发表的共同声明在日本报界和各界人士中引起极大的反响。日本社会党委员长铃木茂三郎昨天晚间说，张奚若和浅沼稻次郎发表的共同声明证明：如果不受外力的压制，而由日中双方诚恳地进行协商，就没有什么东西能够阻碍日中两国恢复邦交。
    他说，日本社会党访华亲善使节团就争取日中邦交正常化的基本方针和当前过渡性质的各项问题，同毛泽东主席和周恩来总理进行了充分的协商，并且取得一致的意见。他认为这是最大的成果。他指出，共同声明完全符合站在独立自由的立场、希望和平与友好的包括中日两国人民在内的亚洲人民的愿望。
    日本共产党第一书记野坂参三指出，共同声明对于迫切希望早日实现恢复中日邦交的日本人民说来，是有划时代的重要意义。他表示，希望日本社会党根据共同声明中指明的原则，为恢复中日邦交而奋斗。他指出，要实现这个目的，日本社会党必须要同日本共产党和一切民主力量携起手来，同企图妨碍恢复中日邦交的势力进行斗争。
    日本内阁官房长官石田博英表示，共同声明只是抽象地指出了日中友好的方向，因此他没有什么反对意见。
    日本执政党自由民主党干事长三木武夫认为，共同声明说台湾是中国的内政问题，并且还主张建立包括美国和苏联在内的保障集体和平的公约，未免“太脱离实际”。
    这几天来，日本各报每天都以巨大篇幅报道日本社会党访华亲善使节团的活动情况。
