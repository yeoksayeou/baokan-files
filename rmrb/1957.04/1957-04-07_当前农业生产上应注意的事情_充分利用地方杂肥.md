Matters Needing Attention in Current Agricultural Production
Fully Utilizing Local Miscellaneous Fertilizers
Xǔ Zhīgāng

To strive for a bumper harvest this year, agricultural cooperatives in various regions need more fertilizer than in previous years. However, the shortage of fertilizer sources this year appears to be more prominent than in the past.

Exploiting local miscellaneous fertilizers is the best way to solve the fertilizer shortage. This is because local miscellaneous fertilizers have great potential, low costs, and are popular among farmers. According to statistics from ten cities including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Xi'an, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Zhengzhou, Changsha, Baoji, and Ningbo: there are more than 3.29 million tons of garbage containing certain fertilizer effects. If 40% can be utilized, it can offset the fertilizer effect of more than 100,000 tons of soybean cake fertilizer. However, the utilization rate of the above ten cities is only 27%. For example, human urine is originally a fertilizer with high output and good fertilizer effect. Calculated based on the national population averaging two catties per person per day (urine contains 0.5% nitrogen), it is roughly equivalent to the effectiveness of more than 10 million tons of chemical fertilizer, but the current utilization is not good, especially in northern cities, where a lot of urine fertilizer is lost. Furthermore, a large amount of manure fertilizer accumulated in the fecal seepage wells of many large and medium-sized cities is also rarely used. Last year, with the assistance of the health department, the Beijing Supply and Marketing Cooperative organized agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs to excavate two seepage wells in Tongren Hospital, which enabled farmers to obtain about 100,000 catties of manure fertilizer. Looking at the country as a whole, this usable fertilizer source is even greater. Moreover, these fertilizer sources cannot be completely exhausted at once, nor will they cease to exist after excavation. Therefore, local miscellaneous fertilizers have great potential and should be fully utilized.

However, while actively exploring and organizing local miscellaneous fertilizer work, supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions should also cooperate with local agricultural departments to promote effective fertilizer production methods and do a good job in fertilizer preservation. According to experiments by the North China Agricultural Science Institute, if urine fertilizer is not properly preserved, 88% of its nitrogen will be lost in twelve days. If manure fertilizer is exposed to the sun for too long, it will also lose a lot of nitrogen. Promoting fertilizer production methods that improve fertilizer efficiency relatively increases the amount of fertilizer, thereby reducing the absolute amount of fertilizer needed in various regions. In recent years, many good fertilizer production methods have been created in various regions. For example, the "clay pot manure water accumulation" method promoted in Huayang, Jianyang, Xinfan, and other counties in Sichuan can increase the fertilizer effect of the original manure by more than two times. Methods such as "artificial urine water" and "green thatch compost" are also fertilizer production methods that improve fertilizer efficiency. Various regions should further study, summarize, and improve these methods on the existing basis to meet the needs of agricultural fertilization.

    当前农业生产上应注意的事情
    充分利用地方杂肥
    许之刚
    为争取今年农业大丰收，各地农业社需要较往年更多的肥料。但是，今年肥源不足的情况较以往显得更加突出。
    挖掘地方杂肥，是解决肥料不足的最好办法。因为地方杂肥潜力大，成本也低，而且受农民欢迎。据北京、天津、上海、西安、广州、武汉、郑州、长沙、宝鸡、宁波等十个城市统计：含有一定肥效的垃圾约有三百二十九万多吨，如能利用40％，即可抵十万多吨豆饼肥效。但是以上十个城市的利用率才达27％。又如，人尿本来是一项产量大、肥效好的肥料，按全国人口每人每天平均二斤（尿含氮0.5％）计算，约相当千万吨以上的化肥效能，而目前利用情况也不好，尤其在北方各城市，很多尿肥都流失了。再如许多大、中城市粪尿渗井中积存的大量粪肥，也利用的很少。北京市供销社去年在卫生部门的协助下，曾组织郊区农业社挖取了同仁医院的两个渗井，就使农民获得了十万斤左右的粪肥。从全国来看，这个可利用的肥源就更多了。何况这些肥源不是一次就可挖完，也不是挖后就不会再有的呢。因此地方杂肥潜力很大，应该充分利用地方杂肥。
    但是，在积极发掘和组织地方杂肥工作的同时，各地供销社还应该配合当地农业部门推广有效的制肥方法，和作好保肥工作。据华北农业科学研究所试验，如尿肥保存不好，十二天即会流失氮素88％。粪肥经太阳晒的时间过长，也会失去很多氮素。推广提高肥效的制肥方法，也就相对地增加了肥料的数量，从而减少了各地需要供应肥料的绝对数量。几年来，各地创造的好的制肥法很多，如四川华阳、简阳、新繁等县推广的“瓦瓮粪水积肥”法，可以使原来粪便肥效提高两倍以上。“人造尿水”、“青槎沤肥”等方法，也都是提高肥效的制肥方法。各地应在现有基础上，进一步研究、总结和改进这些方法，以满足农业施肥需要。
