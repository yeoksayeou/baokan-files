    Leipzig's Bookstores
    Zhao Weihong

    Leipzig is a central city of culture, art, and scientific research in the German Democratic Republic.

    Leipzig has an abundance of bookstores. The names of most of these bookstores commemorate outstanding figures of the past or present in Germany, such as "Franz Mehring Bookstore," "Thälmann Bookstore," "Clara Zetkin Bookstore," etc. There are also bookstores named after foreign writers, such as "Gorky Bookstore," "Martin Andersen Nexø Bookstore," and so on.

    Regardless of their size, readers entering these bookstores will linger and forget to leave. The furnishings and decorations of the bookstores are splendid and elegant, rich and varied. For example, the "Franz Mehring Bookstore" located in Marx Square can serve as an example. The "Mehring Bookstore," also called "Mehring House," is the largest bookstore in Leipzig and is run by the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. It is centrally located, large in scale, and has the most abundant collection of books. The "Mehring Bookstore" is divided into two parts: the science and technology department on the right-hand side of the main entrance, and the social sciences and literature and art department on the left. In the social sciences and literature and art department, people are immediately attracted by the exquisite and winding layout. In a large hall with twists and turns, soft lighting shines; between the bookshelves along the walls, various colored neon lights are installed, complemented by evergreen plants and seasonal flowers. In the middle are rectangular or circular display stands, exhibiting special or newly published books. The hall also displays ancient or modern sculptures, or a famous Meissen porcelain bottle, with rose branches inserted in the bottle. In the middle and to the side are various sofas and round tables for book buyers to rest. People can freely spend some pleasant time here, selecting books or meeting with writers, and even chatting intimately with friends. The light and subtle music broadcast from the walls—Beethoven or Mozart symphonies or German folk songs—further sets off the comfort and rich cultural atmosphere of this environment.

    In the area displaying social science books, those beautifully and generously printed classics by Marx, Engels, and Lenin are placed in long rows on silver-gray bookshelves. On a large, long table covered with a red tablecloth in the middle, new books are displayed, accompanied by huge plaster busts of Marx and Lenin. The sight is very harmonious. The recently published first volume of the "Complete Works of Marx and Engels" is placed in an eye-catching corner, waiting for people to come and buy it. There is also a "Philosophy Corner" here, displaying the recently reprinted classical philosophical works of Hegel and others. Now Hegel's "Aesthetics," "Logic," and other books have been released.

    In the literature and art book section, there is also a special section for imported books from people's democratic countries. Among them, Chinese books are also arranged very exquisitely. People here appreciate publications from the new China with great interest. In addition to the many Chinese books on the shelves, in the past week, a huge volume of "President Sukarno's Collection of Paintings," "The Story of the Stone Critiqued by Zhi Yanzhai," a hardcover edition of "The West Chamber," and "Qi Baishi's Painting Collection," etc., have appeared on the table covered with red velvet. In the corner of the table, there is an ivory carving of a Chinese ancient costume colored female figure, and an ancient Chinese bronze ware of unknown age. Seeing these, I couldn't help but feel a longing for my motherland, and at the same time, I was filled with gratitude for the designer of that bookstore. There is also a large international bookstore in Leipzig's Peace Square, specializing in selling books and periodicals from the Soviet Union and people's democratic countries. This is just a small part of it. The "Mehring Bookstore" also has a department for old books, ancient books, and out-of-print books. There, we can buy English and French editions of literary books from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.

    In every bookstore in Leipzig, people can see the vigorous development of the German Democratic Republic in culture and science, and also understand the improvement of people's living standards. A large number of books are published here that oppose war, defend peace, praise the new society and new life, defend and promote humanitarianism, and praise international friendship.

    莱比锡的书店
    赵玮蕻
    莱比锡是民主德国的一座文化艺术和科学研究的中心城市。
    莱比锡的书店实在是多极了。这些书店的名字大多数是为了纪念过去或现代德国杰出的人物的，如“法朗士·梅林书店”、“台尔曼书店”、“蔡特金书店”等。也有以外国作家命名的。如“高尔基书店”、“马丁·安徒生·尼克索书店”等等。
    那些书店不管大小，读者进去了就会留连忘返。书店的陈设和装饰华丽而雅致，既丰富多彩又变化多端。例如座落在马克思广场的“法朗士·梅林书店”就可以作为一个例子。“梅林书店”也叫“梅林之家”，是莱比锡最大的书店，是德国统一社会党中央办的。它地位适中，规模大而藏书最丰富。“梅林书店”分为两部分，进大门的右手是科学技术部，左手是社会科学和文学艺术部。在社会科学和文学艺术部里，人们一进去，就被那精美而曲折的布置所吸引。一个纵横曲折的大厅里，柔和的灯光照耀着；四围靠墙的书架子间，装着各色的霓虹灯，并配以常青草木和时令花朵。中间放着长方形或圆形的陈列台，展览着特种或新出的书。厅中也摆着古代或近代的雕塑艺术品，或一件梅森出的名磁瓶，瓶中插以玫瑰花枝。中间偏旁有各种沙发椅和圆桌，供买书人休息。人们可以自由地在这里消磨几许愉快的时光，挑选书册或与作家见面，甚至跟朋友们促膝谈天。从壁间播送出来的轻妙的音乐——悲多芬或莫扎特的交响曲或德国的民歌，更衬托出这个环境的安适和浓郁的文化气氛。
    在陈列社会科学书籍的地方，那些印得漂亮而大方的马克思、恩格斯、列宁的经典著作，一长排一长排地放在银灰色的书架子上。中间一张铺着红色桌布的大长桌上，陈列着新书，一旁配以巨大的马克思、列宁的石膏半身像。看了甚是和谐。最近出版的“马克思恩格斯全集”第一卷摆在引人注目的一角，正等待人们来选购。这里还有“哲学之一角”，陈设着不久前重版的黑格尔等人的古典哲学著作。现在黑格尔的“美学”、“逻辑学”等书都已出来了。
    在文艺书籍部还有人民民主国家进口书的专栏。其中中文书布置得也很别致。这里的人以极浓厚的兴趣欣赏新中国的出版物。除了架子上许多中文书外，最近一星期来在那铺着红丝绒的桌上出现了一巨册“苏加诺总统藏画集”和“脂砚斋重评石头记”、精装的“西厢记”和“齐白石画集”等。桌子的一角摆着中国古装着色的仕女象牙雕像，和一件不知什么年代的中国古铜器。看了这些，不禁引起我思念祖国之情，同时对那书店的设计者也充满了感激。莱比锡和平广场还有一个很大的国际书店，专门出售苏联、人民民主国家的书刊。这里不过是聊备一格而已。“梅林书店”里还有旧书、古书、绝版书部。在那里我们可以买到十八、十九世纪英文版和法文版的文学书。
    在莱比锡每个书店里，人们可以看出民主德国在文化科学方面蓬勃发展的情况，也可了解人民生活水平的提高。这里出版了大量反对战争，保卫和平，歌颂新社会新生活，捍卫及发扬人道主义以及赞扬国际友谊的书籍。
