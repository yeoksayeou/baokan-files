Xinhua News Agency, London, 20th - Harry Pollitt, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Great Britain, delivered the political report of the Executive Committee to the opening session of the Party's National Congress. The report was warmly welcomed with thunderous applause.

His report first addressed the current international situation. He said that the failure of the aggression against Egypt and the failure of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary demonstrated that "the forces of peace are now greater than the forces of war." However, "it would be a serious mistake to underestimate the danger of a Third World War. Peace can only be defended through active struggle."

Gollan pointed out that the current policies of the United States and British governments undermine the possibility of reaching an agreement on the prohibition of nuclear weapons. He said that a new and independent British policy is now needed, a "policy that ends subservience to the United States, insists on the withdrawal of American troops, declares nuclear weapons illegal, achieves a European security system, ends colonial wars, and makes Britain a force for new international understanding."

When analyzing the domestic situation in Britain, the report pointed out that the Conservative government's policy is to "maintain the world status of British imperialism." This policy, for the British people, means "a huge burden of armaments and heavy taxes, a reduction in popular consumption and, above all, a reduction in real wages."

The report pointed out that the Conservative Party is facing the biggest political crisis since Churchill's defeat in 1945. One of the most significant new features of the current political situation is the struggle of the middle class and various strata of the liberal professions against Conservative Party policies, and the increasing alienation of many of them from the Conservative Party.

However, the report pointed out that the key problem in the current political situation is the lack of leadership in the struggle against the Conservative Party. The report proposed that "actions outside Parliament must be combined with opposition within Parliament," and that the "every single struggle" of the masses must be "combined with the overall demand for a general election now, to bring down the Conservative government."

The report reiterated the Communist Party's willingness to reach a political understanding with the Labour Party for the benefit of the British working class. However, the report said that no matter what stage the struggle for socialism is at, "a party based on Marxism is indispensable for mobilizing the working class and providing it with political leadership."

Gollan said that the current situation requires more than ever that the working people act broadly in the struggle for their rights. He emphasized that in order for this action to be victorious, every effort must be made to win the unity of the working people, because "the right-wing leaders of the Labour Party oppose mass action." Therefore, Communists should try to organize a left-wing progressive alliance with the participation of trade unions and the Labour Party, while mobilizing all forces—Communist and Labour Party organizations, trade unions, cooperatives, tenant organizations, and organizations of pensioners.

The report called for a comprehensive effort to suspend the bans and exclusions imposed on the Communist Party in the labor movement, and to fight for the Communist Party to participate in local committees in addition to participating in Parliament.

When Gollan said that the Executive Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain had taken a firm stand at the decisive moment on the Hungarian question, his words received sustained applause. When he said that "the task of every Communist, every militant Labour Party member, and peace supporter is to resolutely support the Hungarian government and the Socialist Workers' Party," his words again won applause.

Gollan refuted the so-called "theory" of national communism. He said: "Although every country's path to socialism must have its own characteristics, its main characteristic is the seizure of power by the working class with the support of other progressive classes. This can only be achieved through the mass struggle led by the Party on the basis of democratic centralism and Marxism-Leninism. The rule of the working class must destroy the economic and political power of capitalism and establish social ownership and planned production. These are the central points of the universally applicable Soviet experience, and socialism can only be built on the basis of these experiences."

The report spoke of the great significance of the Soviet October Revolution. After listing the historical role of the Soviet revolution, he said, "The common struggle for socialism requires strengthening the internationalism of the working class centered on the Soviet Union. This will not weaken, but rather strengthen, the responsibility of the Communist Party in each country in formulating its own policies." The reporter continued that the task of the Communists is to do their utmost to consolidate their own party, both against attempts at revisionism and against manifestations of sectarianism.

The report also addressed the conditions and reasons for Stalin's mistakes, while emphasizing that Stalin's great contributions to the revolution should not be ignored.

The report said that the membership of the Communist Party of Great Britain has decreased from 33,960 at the time of the last congress to 27,000. Now, "the Party has passed through a difficult time. Attacks against us have never been so fierce in all aspects. But we have made it through. The Congress should express its respect for the spirit of the vast majority of our members in adhering to communist principles." His words once again received applause from the delegates.

In describing the Party's current tasks, Gollan pointed out that the leadership of the Executive Committee must be strengthened, and the Executive Committee must provide practical assistance to local organizations. The basic policy for developing the Party should be to "increase independent and active branches that have close ties with the workers' movement and the people." At the same time, the work of factory Party organizations must be strengthened. Gollan emphasized that the Party must also strengthen class education, strive to increase the circulation of the "Daily Worker," and invigorate the work of the Communist Youth League.

### 团结工党和工会组织　争取执行独立的英国政策  高兰号召组织广泛的左翼联盟

    团结工党和工会组织　争取执行独立的英国政策
    高兰号召组织广泛的左翼联盟
    新华社伦敦20日电　英国共产党总书记高兰向党的全国代表大会开幕会议作执行委员会的政治报告。报告受到掌声雷动的热烈欢迎。
    他的报告首先谈到目前国际形势问题。他说，侵略埃及的失败和匈牙利反革命叛乱的失败说明，“和平力量现在大于战争势力”。然而，
  “低估第三次世界大战的危险是严重的错误。只有通过积极的斗争才能保卫和平。”
    高兰指出，目前美国和英国政府的政策破坏了在禁止原子核武器问题上达成协议的可能性。他说，现在需要有一个新的独立的英国的政策，一个“结束对美国的屈从，坚持美国军队撤出，宣布核武器为非法，实现欧洲安全制度，结束殖民战争和使英国成为主张新的国际谅解的力量的政策。”
    报告在分析英国国内局势时指出，保守党政府的政策是要“保持英帝国主义的世界地位”。这个政策对英国人民说来，是“巨大的军备负担和沉重的赋税，人民消费的缩减并且首先是实际工资的降低。”
    报告指出，保守党面临着自从丘吉尔在1945年遭到失败以来最大的政治危机。目前政局中最有重大意义的新特点之一是：中等阶级和自由职业各个阶层反对保守党政策的斗争以及其中许多人越来越同保守党疏远。
    但是，报告指出：目前政局中的关键问题是反对保守党的斗争缺乏领导。报告提出，必须把“议会外的行动同议会内的反对结合起来”，必须把群众的“每个单独的斗争同现在提出的举行大选的总的要求结合起来，促使保守党政府倒台。”
    报告重申了共产党愿意为了英国工人阶级的利益同工党达成一致的政治谅解。但是，报告说，不论争取社会主义的斗争处在什么阶段，“以马克思主义为基础的党对于动员工人阶级，并给它以政治领导是必不可少的”。
    高兰说，目前的形势，比任何时候都更要求劳动人民在争取自己权利的斗争中广泛地行动起来。他着重指出，为了使这个行动获得胜利，必须尽一切可能争取劳动人民的团结，因为，“工党右翼领袖反对群众行动”。因此，共产党人应当设法组织一个有工会和工党参加的左翼进步联盟，同时使所有的力量——共产党和工党的组织、工会、合作社、房客组织和领养老金者的组织都行动起来。
    报告号召进行全面努力来中止在劳工运动中对共产党实行的禁令和对它的排斥，并且为共产党除了参加议会以外还参加地方委员会而斗争。
    当高兰说到英共执行委员会在匈牙利问题的决定性关头采取了坚定的立场的时候，他的话得到了经久不息的掌声。当他说到“每一个共产党人，每一个具有战斗精神的工党党员及和平支持者的任务就是要坚决地支持匈牙利政府和社会主义工人党”的时候，他的话又博得了掌声。
    高兰驳斥了所谓民族共产主义的“理论”。他说：“虽然每一个国家走向社会主义都一定有它的特点，可是它的主要特点却是在其他进步阶层的支持下由工人阶级取得政权。这只能在民主集中制和马克思列宁主义的基础上通过党所领导的群众斗争来实现。工人阶级的统治必须摧毁资本主义的经济和政治权力而建立社会所有制和计划生产。这些就是可以普遍适用的苏联经验的中心点，而且社会主义只有根据这些经验才能建立起来。”
    报告谈到苏联十月革命的伟大意义，他在列举苏联革命的历史作用后说，“争取社会主义的共同斗争要求加强以苏联为中心的工人阶级的国际主义。这样不仅不会削弱，反而会加强每个国家的共产党在制定各自的政策方面的责任”。报告人继续说，共产党人的任务在于竭力巩固自己的党，既要反对修正主义的企图，也要反对宗派主义的表现。
    报告也谈到斯大林犯错误的条件和原因，同时它强调指出，不能因而忽视斯大林对革命的伟大贡献。
    报告说，英国共产党党员人数已经从上次代表大会时的三万三千九百六十人减少到了两万七千人。现在，“党已经渡过了困难时间。各方面对我们的进攻从来没有这样激烈过。但是我们已经渡过了。代表大会应当对我们绝大多数党员坚持共产主义原则的精神表示敬意”。他的话再一次获得了代表们的掌声。
    高兰在叙述党的当前任务的时候指出，必须加强执行委员会的领导，执委会必须给予地方组织以实际的援助。发展党的基本方针应当是“增加同工人运动和人民有紧密联系的独立活动的支部”。同时必须加强工厂党组织的工作。高兰强调指出，党还必须加强阶级教育，努力增加“工人日报”的发行份数，活跃共青团的工作。
