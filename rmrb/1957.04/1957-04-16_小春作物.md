    Spring Harvest Crops

    In April, in the south, wheat, barley, rapeseed, broad beans, peas, and some green manure crops like milk vetch are budding or flowering; in the north, in another month, these crops will also be heading and blooming. In the southwest, these crops are called spring harvest crops; in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and other places, they are often called "spring flowers" because these crops all flower in the spring; in northern Anhui and some areas of northern Jiangsu, they are called "mid-season crops" because they are harvested around the Dragon Boat Festival; however, in most parts of the country, they are called summer harvest crops.

    Planting these crops is relatively labor-saving, and winter fallow fields can be used for planting. At present, the area of summer harvest crops in the country is about 600 million mu, accounting for about 27% of the total sown area of crops for the year.

    小春作物
    在4月里，南方的小麦、大麦、油菜、蚕豆、豌豆和有些绿肥作物像紫云英等，正在孕穗或扬花；在北方，再过一个月，这些作物也将吐穗开花了。在西南地区，这些作物叫小春作物；在浙江、江苏等地，多叫做春花，因为这些作物都在春季开花；在安徽北部和苏北的一些地区，叫做午季作物，因为是在“端午”节前后收获的；但是，在全国大部分地区称夏收作物。
    种植这些作物比较省工，而且可以利用冬闲田种植。现在，全国夏收作物面积约有六亿多亩，占全年农作物播种面积的27％左右。
