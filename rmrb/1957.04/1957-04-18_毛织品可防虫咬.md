    Woolens Can Be Insect-Proof
    Scientists at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization in Geelong, Victoria, Australia, have invented an insecticide, "Dieldrin," that can make woolens permanently insect-proof. This method is both cheap and durable.
    The insect-proofing effect of Dieldrin can last as long as a blanket or most woolen garments are used. Washing has little effect on the effectiveness of Dieldrin, and dry cleaning has no effect on it. Tests of new methods of using Dieldrin have been thorough and effective. Blankets that have been insect-proofed have been agitated and boiled in washing machines for more than two and a half hours—longer than ordinary blankets are washed before they are unusable—and are still insect-proof after washing. Some blankets were placed on racks and exposed to the open air day and night, subjected to wind and rain, for six months without losing their insect-proof properties. Still other wet and dry blankets were placed in hot ovens and coolers, with the same results.

    毛织品可防虫咬
    设在澳大利亚维多利亚州吉隆的英联邦科学和工业研究组织的科学家，发明了一种杀虫药地耳剂，能使毛织品永久不受虫咬。这种办法既便宜又耐久。
    地耳剂的防虫效用可以和一床毯子或大多数羊毛衣服使用时间一样长。洗涤对地耳剂的效力影响很小，干洗对它毫无影响。对于使用地耳剂的新方法的试验是彻底的，有效的。已经经过防虫处理的毯子曾经放在洗涤机内搅动煮了两个半小时以上的时间——比普通毯子在直到不能用时所洗的时间还要长——洗好以后仍然不怕虫咬。有些毯子铺在架子上，日夜曝露在露天中，风吹雨打，这样放了六个月，而不失去它的防虫性质。还有其他一些湿的和干的毯子被放进热炉子和冷却器里，结果也是一样。
