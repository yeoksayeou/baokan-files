    Exploiting the Potential of Sandy Land to Guarantee the Nation's Need for Industrial Raw Materials:
    Jilin Province Expands Sugar Beet Planting Area
    (Our reporter Tang Baoshun reports) Jilin Province, which successfully test-planted sugar beets in the western sandy area, plans to expand the sugar beet planting area to 17,500 hectares this year, an increase of more than 4,000 hectares compared to last year.
    Last year, Jilin Province systematically transplanted sugar beets to the sandy area of Baicheng Prefecture in the west. The actual harvest area of the entire prefecture last year was more than 12,000 hectares, with an average yield of more than 24,000 jin per hectare. The average sugar content reached about 18%, which is more than 5% higher than the sugar beet yield in the Gongzhuling Prefecture in the central plains area.
    This year, based on the principle of rational land use, the province has increased the sugar beet planting plan in Baicheng Prefecture. This will resolve the contradiction between grain and sugar beet land use in some areas of the central region. To achieve this plan, Jilin Province has decided to appropriately increase the purchase price of sugar beets and change the past excessively rigid technical requirements for sugar beet planting and unreasonable phenomena in sugar beet purchasing.
    Currently, many agricultural cooperatives have trained sugar beet planting technicians and formulated planting plans, and are stepping up spring plowing preparations.

### 发挥风砂地带土地潜力　保证国家工业原料需要  吉林省扩大甜菜播种面积

    发挥风砂地带土地潜力　保证国家工业原料需要
    吉林省扩大甜菜播种面积
    本报讯　本报记者汤宝顺报道：试种甜菜成功的吉林省西部风砂地带，今年计划要把甜菜播种面积扩大到一万七千五百公顷，比去年增加四千多公顷。
    吉林省去年曾经有计划地把甜菜移种到西部的白城专区的风砂地带。全专区去年实际收获面积一万二千多公顷，每公顷平均产量都在二万四千斤以上，含糖率平均达到18％左右，比中部平原地区公主岭专区甜菜产量要高5％还多。
    今年，这个省根据合理利用土地的原则，在白城专区增加了甜菜的播种计划。这样，将使中部部分地区粮食和甜菜争地的矛盾得以解决。为实现这个计划，吉林省决定适当地提高甜菜收购价格，改变了过去对于甜菜种植技术要求过死和甜菜收购中的不合理现象。
    目前，许多农业社已经训练了种植甜菜的技术手和制订出播种计划，正在加紧进行春耕准备工作。
