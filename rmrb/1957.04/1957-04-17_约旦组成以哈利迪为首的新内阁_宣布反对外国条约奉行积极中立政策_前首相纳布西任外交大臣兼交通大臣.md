(This article was compiled from various reports) According to a New China News Agency dispatch from Amman: Amman Radio broadcast on the evening of the 15th the order of King Hussein appointing a new cabinet headed by Khalidi. Western news agencies called this new cabinet a "stopgap" transitional cabinet.

The new cabinet consists of seven people, mainly non-partisan figures. Khalidi, the former foreign minister who was the first to be designated to form a cabinet by the King after the dismissal of the Nabulsi cabinet, serves as Prime Minister and Minister of Defense. The dismissed Prime Minister Nabulsi serves in the new cabinet as Foreign Minister and Minister of Transport.

Khalidi is of Palestinian origin. During the First World War, he served in the Turkish army. From 1921, he was engaged in medical work in Jerusalem. He served as the Mayor of Jerusalem from 1935 to 1937. From 1938 to 1947, he served as the Secretary-General of the Arab Higher Committee. From 1950 to 1952, he served as the custodian of holy sites in Jerusalem. He served as the Jordanian Foreign Minister three times between 1953-1954 and January-May 1956.

Khalidi announced on the evening of the 15th that his cabinet's policies would include achieving Arab unity, opposing foreign treaties, and pursuing a policy of active neutrality.

King Hussein also issued a statement after the formation of the new cabinet, saying that the cabinet changes did not mean a change in policy. He said: "Jordan will continue to follow the policies of free Arab nations."

On the same day, Jordan warned Israel that "any provocative or aggressive actions taken by Israel against Jordan" would be met with armed retaliation by the Jordanian army.

At the same time, the Syrian Foreign Ministry issued a statement denying foreign newspapers' reports that King Hussein of Jordan had requested Syria to withdraw its troops stationed in Jordan. Jordan has 3,000 Syrian troops stationed there, which entered Jordan during the Anglo-French-Israeli invasion of Egypt to prevent aggression.

Western news agencies believe that the new cabinet is the product of a compromise between pro-Western and nationalist forces in Jordan, and that Nabulsi's inclusion in the cabinet is a concession to the National Socialist Party, which enjoys popular support.

According to Nimer, a member of the National Socialist Party who was invited to form a cabinet twice during the six-day cabinet crisis, Nabulsi joined the cabinet as a former prime minister rather than as the leader of the party. Nimer pointed out that the National Socialist Party's attitude towards the new cabinet will depend on the political program it presents to the parliament.

Western news agencies believe that the struggle between nationalist and pro-Western forces in Jordan is far from over. The Associated Press reported that it expects the new cabinet to invite Richard, the US special envoy who is promoting the Eisenhower Doctrine in the Middle East, to Jordan. It also quoted some Jordanian officials as expressing the hope that the new government will "thoroughly cleanse the leftists who have infiltrated the government and schools."

According to the Syrian newspaper "Al-Alam" on the 16th, quoting the newly appointed Jordanian Foreign Minister Nabulsi as saying: Nowar is still the Chief of Staff of the Jordanian Army. Nabulsi told the newspaper's reporter in a telephone interview that Nowar is currently on a two-week vacation and will soon resume his duties. Prior to this, Western news agencies had circulated rumors that Nowar had been removed from his post as Chief of Staff and expelled to Syria.

Reports say that the Jordanian capital is currently under what amounts to martial law, although martial law has not been formally declared. Desert troops summoned to the capital are patrolling the streets, police are equipped with riot control gear, and they have occupied all important locations.

    约旦组成以哈利迪为首的新内阁
    宣布反对外国条约奉行积极中立政策
    前首相纳布西任外交大臣兼交通大臣
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：安曼电台15日晚间广播了国王侯赛因任命以哈利迪为首的新内阁的命令。西方通讯社把这个新内阁称为“堵塞空隙”的过渡内阁。
    新内阁共由七人组成，主要是无党派人士。纳布西内阁被解职后第一个由国王指定组阁的前外交大臣哈利迪任首相兼国防大臣。被解职的首相纳布西在新内阁中任外交大臣兼交通大臣。
    哈利迪是巴勒斯坦籍人，第一次世界大战期间，他曾在土耳其军队中服务。1921年起一直在耶路撒冷从事医务工作。1935—1937年任耶路撒冷市长。1938—1947年任阿拉伯高级委员会秘书长。1950—1952年任耶路撒冷圣地看守人。1953—1954年间和1956年1月至5月，他曾三次担任约旦外交大臣。
    哈利迪在15日晚宣布，他的内阁的政策将包括实现阿拉伯的团结，反对外国的条约和奉行积极中立的外交政策。
    侯赛因国王在新内阁成立后也发表声明说，内阁的变动并不意味着政策的改变。他说：“约旦将继续遵循自由阿拉伯国家的政策。”
    同一天约旦警告以色列说，“以色列对约旦采取的任何挑衅行动或者侵略行动”都将遭到约旦军队的武力回击。
    与此同时，叙利亚外交部发表声明，否认外国报纸所传约旦国王侯赛因曾经要求叙利亚撤退它驻在约旦的军队的消息。约旦驻有叙利亚军队三千人，这些军队是在英、法、以色列发动侵埃战争期间进入约旦以防备侵略的。
    西方通讯社认为新内阁是约旦亲西方和民族主义力量之间妥协的产物，纳布西被吸收入内阁是对受到人民拥护的国家社会党的一个让步。
    据在为时六天的内阁危机中曾经两度被邀组阁的国家社会党人尼默尔说，纳布西是以前首相而不是以这个党的领袖的身份参加内阁的。尼默尔指出，国家社会党对新内阁的态度将要视它向议会提出的政纲而定。
    西方通讯社认为，约旦民族主义力量和亲西方力量之间的斗争还远没有过去。美联社在报道中表示期待新内阁将邀请正在中东推销艾森豪威尔主义的美国特使理查兹到约旦来。它还援引约旦某些官员的话表示希望新政府将“彻底清除渗入了政府和学校的左派分子”。
    据16日的叙利亚“旗帜报”援引约旦新任外交大臣纳布西的话说：诺瓦尔仍然是约旦陆军的参谋长。纳布西在电话中接见这家报纸的记者说：诺瓦尔目前正在度两星期的假日，他不久即将恢复他的职务。在这以前，西方通讯社曾经流传诺瓦尔已被解除陆军参谋长职务，并被驱逐到叙利亚。
    有消息说，约旦首都目前实际上还处于戒严状态，虽然并没有宣布戒严。被召入首都的沙漠军队在街道上巡逻，警察配备着镇压骚乱的装备，并且占据了一切重要地点。
