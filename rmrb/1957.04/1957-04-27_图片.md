　　The largest and newest Southwest Sluice in South China has been completed before the spring flood season. Together with the Lubao Sluice and the Beijiang Embankment, it will protect over one million mu of farmland in Guangzhou and other counties such as Nanhai from flooding, and transform 140,000 mu of wasteland and single-cropping fields into double-cropping fields.
