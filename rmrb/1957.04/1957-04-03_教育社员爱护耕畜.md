    Educating Commune Members to Cherish Draft Animals
    In the spring plowing production, the Yuci Special District of Shanxi Province has exposed a rather prominent problem: the phenomenon of emaciated draft animals is quite serious. According to statistics from Xiyang County, emaciated draft animals account for 25%-30% of the total number of draft animals, and in individual agricultural cooperatives, emaciated draft animals account for more than 40%. The situation in Yuci County is also not good. Among the 15,000 draft animals in the county, more than 600 are unusable.
    The emaciation of draft animals is abnormal. This can be seen from the statistics of Zuoquan County: among the 430 emaciated and dead cattle, 128 were strong cattle not long ago, and most of the rest were small and young cattle. Truly old and disabled draft animals account for only a very small number. So, what are the reasons for the emaciation and death of draft animals? In addition to the fact that some areas do indeed lack forage and feed (the entire area is short of about 200 million jin of forage), the main reasons are poor feeding management and improper use. According to a survey by the Yuci Special Office of Agriculture and Forestry Bureau, only 50% of the agricultural cooperatives in the area have promoted the quota management system for draft animal feeding and use, and only about 20% of them are truly implementing it well. The rest mostly only have the form. Therefore, in many agricultural cooperatives, there is chaos in the feeding and use of draft animals. Some cooperatives concentrate large and small livestock together, causing them to bite and kick each other; some cooperatives do not have quotas for draft animal labor, and there is no quantitative or timed feeding of grass and feed; some cooperatives' feeders and users do not communicate with each other, and the draft animals are taken away before they are full. If the draft animals are injured during use, the feeders do not even know; in some cooperatives, the feeders are not focused on feeding the livestock, and even steal grass and feed. Why has the draft animal feeding management work of some agricultural cooperatives not been improved for a long time? Some people believe that this is a bad result of centralized feeding. Therefore, they advocate that the draft animals should be fed by the families who originally owned them, with the cooperative providing forage. Others oppose this view. They believe that the key to the problem lies in conducting ideological education among commune members to cherish draft animals.
    Some townships and agricultural cooperatives in Yuci Special District have adopted an effective method of educating feeders and improving feeding management: holding regular draft animal appraisal meetings. Recently, eight townships in Zuoquan County held draft animal appraisal meetings in different areas and achieved great results. For example, at the draft animal appraisal meeting in Fokou Township, more than 96% of the 268 draft animals were strong and fat. Therefore, 31 of the 53 feeders in this township were selected as models and received commendations and rewards. They mainly exchanged experience in draft animal feeding management at the meeting. The meeting also helped other feeders find ways to improve and recognize the direction of their efforts. This kind of draft animal appraisal meeting has played a great role in protecting draft animals and promoting spring plowing.
    At present, party and government leading cadres in many counties in Yuci Special District are trying their best to overcome this phenomenon. Yuci County has formulated three emergency measures, which have been widely promoted throughout the county: 1. In addition to allocating the 60,000 jin of wheat bran currently in the grain bureau to agricultural cooperatives with insufficient feed, the masses will also be mobilized to cut thatch to solve the forage shortage. 2. Veterinary stations will immediately conduct routine inspections of draft animals throughout the county, and universally carry out preventive injections or oral medication to prevent epidemics. 3. Draft animal appraisal meetings will be held in townships or areas to universally conduct an education on protecting and cherishing animals, and establish a quota management system for feeding and use.

    教育社员爱护耕畜

    山西省榆次专区在春耕生产中暴露出来一个比较突出的问题：耕畜瘦弱现象相当严重。据昔阳县的统计：瘦弱耕畜已占到耕畜总数的25％—30％，在个别的农业社里，瘦弱耕畜竟占到40％以上。榆次县的情况也不好，全县一万五千头耕畜中，有六百多头已经无法使用。
    耕畜的瘦弱现象是不正常的。这从左权县的统计中可以看出：在瘦弱和死亡的四百三十头耕牛中，有一百二十八头在不久前还是壮畜，其余的多是小畜和幼畜，真正的老残耕畜只占极少数。那末，耕畜瘦弱和死亡的原因是什么呢？除了一部分地区确实是由于饲草饲料不足（全区约缺饲草两亿斤）以外，主要原因是饲养管理不善和使役不当。据榆次专署农林局调查，全区只有50％的农业社推广了耕畜的饲养使役定额管理制度，其中真正执行得好的，约有20％，其余的大部分只有个形式。因此，在许多农业社里出现了耕畜饲养和使役的混乱现象。有的社大小牲畜集中在一起，乱咬乱踢；有的社耕畜劳役没定额、喂草喂料没有定量和定时；有的社饲养人员和使役人员互不联系，耕畜没吃饱就被拉走了，使役中耕畜受了伤，饲养人员也不知道；也有的社，饲养人员不安心饲养牲畜，甚至还偷草偷料。为什么一些农业社的耕畜饲养管理工作长期不能改善呢？有人认为这是集中饲养带来的恶果。因此，他们主张原来是谁家的耕畜再让谁家去饲养，由社里供给草料。也有人反对这种说法。他们认为，问题的关键在于对社员进行爱护耕畜的思想教育。
    榆次专区有些乡和农业社采取了一种对饲养人员进行教育、改善饲养管理工作的有效方法：定期举行耕畜评比大会。最近左权县有八个乡分片举行了耕畜评比大会，获得了很大的成绩。比如在佛口乡的耕畜评比大会上，二百六十八头耕畜中，体壮膘肥的就占到96％以上，因此，这个乡的五十三名饲养员，有三十一名被选为模范，受到了表扬和奖励。大会以他们为主交流了耕畜饲养管理经验。大会还帮助另外一些饲养员找出了改进办法，认识了努力方向。这种耕畜评比大会，对保护耕畜和推动春耕起了很大的作用。
    目前，榆次专区许多县的党政领导干部，正在想尽一切办法来克服这种现象。榆次县拟订了三项紧急措施，已经在全县普遍推行：一、除将粮食局现存的六万斤麸子配给饲料不足的农业社外，并将动员群众打茅草解决饲草困难。二、兽医站立即对全县耕畜进行巡回检查，并普遍进行预防注射或饮灌药物，预防疫病。三、以乡或片举行耕畜评比大会，普遍进行一次保畜爱畜教育，并建立起饲养使役定额管理制度。
