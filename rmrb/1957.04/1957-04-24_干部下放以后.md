　　A large number of cadres with rich experience in rural work have been sent down, greatly strengthening the leading backbone of rural grassroots organizations. The outlook of rural grassroots work has begun to change.

　　However, this certainly does not mean that once the cadres are sent down, everything will be fine, and the leading organs can sit there and wait for the good news from the sent-down cadres. Things are not that simple. The situation in Mancheng is a good illustration. Similar situations exist in many places. In some places, work has been hampered because the duties are not clear; some township cadres, seeing a large number of cadres being sent down, feel that the leadership no longer trusts them, so they become negative and pessimistic, and even dissatisfied with the cadres who have come down, deliberately creating problems to "checkmate" them when they are new and unfamiliar with the situation; some sent-down cadres, relying on their high level and experience, do everything themselves, paying little attention to giving play to the enthusiasm of the original township cadres; a few sent-down cadres complain about the hardship of life, become emotional, and are not at ease in their work... The practice of the Mancheng County Party Committee is worth promoting. After the cadres are sent down, they promptly understand the situation, solicit their opinions, and immediately start to solve problems when they are discovered. Only by solving these problems can the enthusiasm of the sent-down cadres and the original cadres be fully brought into play. If the leading organs do not come to help solve problems in time, then the leadership work of these grassroots units may not be strengthened.

　　After the cadres are sent down, many new problems will arise in terms of cadre relations, work methods, etc. Once a problem is solved, another problem may arise; new experiences and good working methods will also continue to emerge. These all require leading organs above the county level to strengthen their leadership over grassroots work, not only to convene them to meetings to listen to their reports and opinions, but also to go deep down to discover problems, to find new experiences in the embryonic stage, to cultivate them, to help them, so that they can mature more quickly and spread more quickly. It is hoped that the leading organs above the county level in various places can make the leadership work more in-depth with the sending down of cadres.

    干部下放以后
　  易槐
    大批富有农村工作经验的干部下放了，农村基层组织的领导骨干大大地充实了。农村基层工作的面貌已经开始有所改变。
    可是，这决不是说，干部一放下去，就万事大吉，领导机关就可以坐在那里等候下放干部的捷报。事情决不这样简单。满城的情况就是一个很好的说明。类似的情况不少地方都有。有的因为职务不明确，使工作发生了困难；有的乡干部看到大批干部下放，就觉得领导不信任他们了，于是消极悲观起来，甚至对下来的干部不满意，趁他们刚下来还不熟悉情况的时候，故意出难题“将”他们的“军”；有些下放的干部自恃自己水平高，有经验，遇事包办，不大注意发挥原有乡干部的积极性；个别下乡干部嫌生活苦，闹情绪，不安心工作……。满城县委的做法很值得提倡。在干部下去以后，及时地了解情况，征询他们的意见，一发现问题，马上就着手解决。只有解决了这些问题，下放干部和原有干部的积极性才能充分发挥。如果领导机关不来及时帮助解决问题，那么，这些基层单位的领导工作就未必会加强。
    干部下放以后，干部关系、工作方法等方面会出现很多新问题，一个问题解决了，又一个问题可能又发生了；新的经验、好的工作方法也会不断出现，这些，都要求县以上的领导机关加强对基层工作的领导，不但召集他们开会，听取他们的汇报和意见，还应该深入下去发现问题，去寻找萌芽状态的新经验，培植它，帮助它，使它更快地成熟，更快地传播出去。希望各地县以上的领导机关能够随着干部的下放使领导工作更为深入。
