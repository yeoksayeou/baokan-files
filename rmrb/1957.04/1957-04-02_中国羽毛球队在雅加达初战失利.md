Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 1st. On the evening of March 30th, the Chinese badminton team and Indonesian national badminton players with world-class standards held their first match in Jakarta. In the three singles matches, Indonesian players defeated the Chinese team two to zero. In the two doubles matches, the Chinese team won one.

In this competition, both sides had excellent performances. The Indonesian players were mostly experienced and composed, with fierce smashes and agile ball reception. In the match between Wang Wenjiao, the Chinese singles champion of last year, and Chen Youfu, the Indonesian singles champion of this year, the competition was the most intense. In the first game, Wang Wenjiao once led with fourteen to nine, but because Chen Youfu was able to respond calmly, with continuous fast smashes, Wang Wenjiao was never able to win the final point, and as a result, lost to Chen Youfu by fourteen to sixteen. In another singles match, Huang Shiming, the Chinese runner-up last year, lost to Oli, the Indonesian runner-up this year, and the match was very tense. Yusuf, the third-place Indonesian singles player this year, easily defeated China's Shi Ningan.

In the first doubles match, Chinese players Huang Shiming and Shi Ningan defeated veteran Indonesian players Yan Kaihe and Wu Shunlu by two to zero. In the second doubles match, Indonesians Yang Jinmei and Chen Jingyuan defeated China's Wang Wenjiao and Chen Fushou by two to one.

    中国羽毛球队在雅加达初战失利
    新华社雅加达1日电　3月30日晚上，中国羽毛球队和有世界水平的印度尼西亚羽毛球国手在雅加达举行第一次比赛，三场单打中，印度尼西亚选手都以二比零胜中国队。在两场双打中，中国队胜了一场。
    在这次交锋中，双方都有精彩表演。印度尼西亚选手大都老练沉着，扣杀凶猛，接球灵活。中国去年的单打冠军王文教对今年印度尼西亚单打冠军陈有福的比赛中，双方争夺最为激烈，第一局王文教曾以十四比九领先，但由于陈有福能沉着应战，连续快杀猛扣，使王文教始终未能赢得最后一球，结果反以十四比十六败于陈有福。另一场单打，中国去年的亚军黄世明败于印度尼西亚今年的亚军奥利，比赛进行得很紧张。今年印度尼西亚单打第三名优素福则轻取中国的施宁安。
    第一场双打比赛，中国选手黄世明和施宁安以二比零战胜印度尼西亚宿将颜开和、吴顺禄。第二场双打，印度尼西亚的杨锦美、陈敬源以二比一胜中国的王文教、陈福寿。
