Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 8th—The Soviet Union will massively manufacture inexpensive and beautiful prefabricated houses in various places this year for sale to the working people. In the Russian Federation alone, the prefabricated housing manufacturing plants plan to manufacture bungalows and two-story buildings, including three and four-room apartments, with a total living area of 870,000 square meters this year.

    The Shekino Timber Processing Factory in Tula Oblast has already manufactured a wooden bungalow. This bungalow has a total of 36.5 square meters and is very convenient to transport and assemble. The factory plans to sell these houses for 5,000 rubles each, which is about half a year's wages for workers in some factories. If it is a collective farm with high labor day income, then the price of each such house is less than 200 labor days' cash income. Therefore, ordinary members can afford to buy them.

    In addition to wooden houses, prefabricated housing factories in various places also manufacture reinforced concrete structures. These are manufactured according to standard house designs and are very convenient to disassemble and install. These houses have been supplied to the reclamation areas in the Soviet Union in large quantities in the past, and this year they will be sold to the working people in many cities and rural areas.

    进一步改善人民居住条件
    苏联大量制造预装配房屋
    劳动人民半年收入可购一幢
    新华社莫斯科8日电　苏联各地今年将大量制造价廉美观的预装配房屋，出售给劳动人民。单是俄罗斯联邦的预装配房屋制造工厂今年准备制造的平房和包括三、四套房间的两层楼楼房，居住总面积就将达八十七万平方公尺。
    图拉州的谢金木料加工工厂已经制造出一种木制的平房。这种平房共有三十六点五平方公尺，运输和装配都非常便利。工厂准备以每幢五千卢布的价格出售这种房屋，这约等于有些工厂的工人半年的工资。如果是劳动日收入高的集体农庄，那么每幢这种房屋的价格还不到二百个劳动日的现金收入。因此，一般庄员都可以购置得起。
    除木制房屋外，各地预装配房屋工厂还制造钢筋混凝土结构的房屋，它们都是按标准房屋设计制造的，拆卸和安装都非常便利。这种房屋过去曾经向苏联东部开垦地区大量供应过，而今年将在许多城市和农村中向劳动人民普遍出售。
