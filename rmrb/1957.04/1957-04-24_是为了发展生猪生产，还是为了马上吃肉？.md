    Is it for Developing Pig Production, or for Eating Meat Right Away?
    Lù Hào
    Everyone understands the principle that if units with the conditions to raise pigs can raise more, it will greatly help alleviate the national meat supply shortage and improve everyone's lives. However, some people are taking crooked paths in doing this good thing.
    That is, some canteens in government agencies, troops, schools, and enterprises, nominally to develop pig production, go to the countryside to buy pigs to raise, but actually search everywhere for fat pigs, seizing the opportunity to improve their own lives. According to the Dongjiao Working Group of the Shenyang Food Company, by the end of March, twelve units in the Dongjiao area of Shenyang had already bought fat pigs at high prices. Similar things are still happening elsewhere. Obviously, if these activities are not stopped quickly, they will not only seriously harm the normal development of pig production, but also exacerbate the current meat supply shortage.
    Due to the insufficient production of fat pigs, coupled with many units going to the countryside to buy fat pigs at high prices, it has made the Shenyang Food Company's pig procurement work even more difficult. For example, the Xinhua Printing Factory in Shenyang bought 94 fat pigs from the Changqing Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs, but the food company specializing in pig procurement only bought 50 from the cooperative. The Xinsheng Farm under the Liaoning Provincial Public Security Department not only did not sell fat pigs to the state, but also bought 41 fat pigs weighing over 250 jin from Kangping and Changtu, dwarfing the state procurement agencies in comparison. The failure of the food company to complete its pig procurement plan directly reduces the meat supply for the vast urban residents, especially affecting the rational allocation of meat to sanatoriums, nurseries, and those working at high altitudes, high temperatures, and in underground mines. Moreover, because some units buy pigs at high prices, some farmers, seeing the potential for profit, have abandoned preparations for farming and started trading in live pigs, which has had an extremely bad impact on agricultural production.
    Since the purpose of some collective canteens buying pigs is to eat meat right away, a situation of indiscriminate slaughtering has emerged. A state-owned factory in Shenyang bought 23 pigs, 20 of which were sows. By the time the local animal husbandry and veterinary station discovered it, only one live sow was left. A shortage of sows is one of the serious difficulties in developing pig production in the Liaoning area. This factory, simply for the sake of eating meat themselves, slaughtered even the sows, which is very regrettable. Some units bought pigs weighing around 100 jin and slaughtered them hastily after raising them for only a few days. In fact, these pigs were in the best period of fattening. Someone has calculated that if each pig could be allowed to grow ten more jin of meat before being slaughtered, then one hundred pigs would be equivalent to raising ten more pigs, which is also a considerable number for increasing the meat supply.
    We advocate that government agencies, troops, schools, and enterprises with the conditions to raise pigs should raise some, mainly to make fuller use of their remaining human and material resources to help our country increase the meat supply. If the practice of not focusing on raising pigs but only on eating meat right away is allowed to develop, it will only add fuel to the fire of the current tight meat supply, which should be stopped quickly.

### 是为了发展生猪生产，还是为了马上吃肉？

    是为了发展生猪生产，还是为了马上吃肉？

    凡是有条件养猪的单位能够多养一些猪，这对于帮助缓和国家肉食供应的紧张状况和改善大家的生活有着很大的好处，这个道理是谁也明白的。可是就在办这样一件好事情上，偏偏又有一些人在走邪门歪道。
    这就是某些机关、部队、学校、企业的伙食单位，他们名义上说是为了发展生猪生产，下乡买猪喂养，实际上是到处搜罗肥猪，趁此机会捞一把改善生活。据沈阳市食品公司东郊工作组说：3月底在沈阳东郊一带，已经有十二个单位用高价收买肥猪。类似的事情还在其他地方不断发生。十分明显，这些活动如不赶快制止，它不但严重地危害着生猪生产的正常发展，而且加剧了当前肉食供应的紧张程度。
    由于肥猪生产不足，再加上很多单位下乡高价收买肥猪，这就使得食品公司的生猪收购工作更加困难了。譬如，沈阳市新华印刷厂曾在市郊长青农业生产合作社买了九十四头肥猪，但专门收购生猪的食品公司在该社只买到了五十头。辽宁省公安厅所属的新生农场，不但没有肥猪卖给国家，反而在康平、昌图一带搜买了二百五十斤以上的肥猪四十一头，相形之下，国家收购机构也为之逊色。食品公司生猪收购计划不能完成，就直接减少了城市广大居民的肉食供应，特别是影响到对于像疗养院、托儿所以及在高空高温井下工作的人的肉食的合理分配。不但如此，由于某些单位高价买猪，有的农民看到有利可图，就放下了备耕工作，干起贩卖生猪的买卖来，这对农业生产也产生了极为不好的影响。
    既然有些集体伙食单位买猪的目的是为了眼前吃肉，这就出现了一种乱宰乱杀的情形。沈阳市有个国营工厂买了二十三头猪，其中有二十头是母猪，等到当地的畜牧兽医工作站发觉时，已经只剩下一头活母猪了。缺少母猪，是辽宁地区发展生猪生产的严重困难之一，这个工厂仅仅为了自己吃肉，连母猪也格杀勿论，这是很令人惋惜的。有的单位买了些一百斤左右的猪，养了不几天，就急急忙忙把它宰掉了，其实这样一些猪正在育肥长膘的最好时期。有人算过一笔账，如果每头猪能让它多长十斤肉再宰，那么一百头猪，就等于多养了十头猪，这对增加肉食来说，也是一笔不小的数字。
    我们提倡有条件养猪的机关、部队、学校、企业单位都能够养一些猪，主要是为了能更充分地利用本单位剩余的人力物力，帮助我们的国家增加肉食。那种不是为了养猪，只顾眼前吃肉的做法，如果任其发展，对于当前紧张的肉食供应只会火上添油，这是应该迅速制止的。
