    A Tragedy and Also a Warning
    Hu Ping
    Washington's "New Record"
    It is said that a certain court's case file records the following defense by a murderer:
    "First, I would like to express my sincere condolences to the deceased! However, I would like to explain that the murder was committed by my left hand, and according to my body structure, my right hand and brain have no power to interfere with my left hand. Therefore, regrettably, I cannot bear any responsibility."
    People may think this is just an absurd and detestable joke. However, after the U.S. Senate Internal Security Subcommittee recently hounded Canadian Ambassador to Egypt Norman to his death, the U.S. government has unreservedly adopted this kind of defense.
    On April 10, Washington issued a note to the Canadian government, signed by the person in charge of the U.S. State Department, which stated:
      "...First, I would like to express...sincere condolences to the Canadian government and Mrs. Norman. ...I would like to explain to you that any defamatory material (regarding Norman) was the responsibility of the Subcommittee itself to include in the record. As you know, according to our government system, the executive branch has no legal authority to interfere with the committees of the U.S. Congress.... My government...regrets..."
    On the same day, U.S. President Eisenhower personally came forward, emphasizing the "separation of powers" between the U.S. government and Congress at a press conference, and demanded that Canada not "reproach" the U.S. government.
    People have seen countless documents filled with hypocrisy, fraud, and unreasonable behavior in American diplomatic records, but this note to Canada must be said to be a new record. Anyone with a little diplomatic common sense knows that, whether according to international law or the U.S. Constitution, the U.S. President and State Department represent the United States externally. However, they can calmly and naturally push their responsibility for the Norman incident completely onto the Canadian government. Perhaps the U.S. President and State Department believe that: treating an "ally" like Canada, fooling it like an idiot, is enough to get by. Therefore, Eisenhower said in the aforementioned press conference in a tone of a parent admonishing a child, "This matter (referring to the Norman incident) can now be put down"!
    The Struggle Between Left and Right Hands
    However, although Washington's right hand is eager to "put it down," its left hand is unwilling to bear the blame. Compared with the State Department, the McCarthyites in the U.S. Congress are, after all, simpler-minded. They don't yet understand how to play the hypocritical game of "sincere condolences," but are eager to prove that they were merely acting on orders. Therefore, the day after the U.S. State Department responded to Canada, the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee hurriedly issued a statement saying that it published the materials persecuting Norman with the "consent" of the State Department. Moreover, the State Department, together with the U.S. intelligence agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, had "verified" and "confirmed" these materials in advance. In this way, the U.S. government's so-called "separation of powers" theory was completely exposed. The white glove worn on the right hand was torn off by its own left hand all at once, revealing the State Department's hands stained with blood.
    Even at this stage, the U.S. government still wants to continue to fool Canadian and world public opinion. A few hours after the unfortunate statement of the U.S. Senate was published, Washington's McCarthyites and the State Department suddenly reconciled, one asking the U.S. news agency to "withdraw" the statement that revealed the truth, and the other holding a press conference in the State Department, repeating the bankrupt nonsense, and continuing to claim that it was not responsible in any way. This move by Washington is equivalent to declaring to Canada: Even if you see me commit the crime, but I don't admit it, what can you do to me!
    Killing the Chicken to Scare the Monkey
    In fact, this kind of bullying attitude by the United States did not start today. As early as 1951, when the United States began to accuse Norman of being "disloyal," the Canadian government conducted a "thorough investigation" of Norman, and concluded that Norman was "loyal" and could be "completely trusted." Even so, Canada still made concessions, transferring Norman far away from the United Nations to New Zealand and Egypt. However, the United States, like a vulture in the desert sky, relentlessly pursued the target it had set its sights on, determined to put it to death. After the death, it would not allow others to "cry injustice."
    It seems that Washington clearly believes that the death of a Norman or two is a good opportunity for it to kill the chicken to scare the monkeys, so that it can more effectively continue its "loyalty investigation" in the future, and properly manage the people of its own country and its "allies." However, after all, there are also thorny issues this time, because in addition to causing national uproar in Canada, London, Tokyo and other places have also put forward "showers of condemnation" to the United States, and some people in the United States also feel that this matter is "too costly." In this way, the U.S. government and Congress had to perform several "cleanup" scenes respectively to calm the storm. However, they didn't even act very seriously, and the actors were even too lazy to rehearse their lines beforehand, resulting in infighting and getting worse and worse.
    For the people of the so-called "free world," the Norman incident should be very educational: even an upper-class figure like Norman who is "completely trusted" by his own government is so worthless in the eyes of the United States! Even a government as "loyal" to the United States as Canada is treated unscrupulously by the United States. No wonder the British "Times" also exclaimed: The Norman incident is a "tragedy and also a warning"! (Attached picture)

    是悲剧也是警告
    胡平
    华盛顿的“新纪录”
    据说，某一个法庭的案卷内，记录着一个杀人犯的这样一段辩护词：
    “首先，我想向死者表示真诚的哀悼！但是，我愿意说明，行凶的是我的左手，而根据我的身体结构，右手和头脑对于左手是没有权力可以过问的。因此，很遗憾，我不能担负任何责任。”
    人们也许以为这不过是一个荒谬和可憎的笑话。但是，在最近美国参议院国内安全小组委员会逼死了加拿大驻埃及大使诺曼之后，美国政府却不折不扣地采用了这样的辩护术。
    4月10日，华盛顿发表了由美国国务院负责人签署的一项回答加拿大政府的照会，它说：
      “……首先，我想向加拿大政府和诺曼夫人表示……真诚哀悼。……我愿意向你说明，（有关诺曼的）任何诋毁性材料都是由小组委员会自己负责列入记录的。如你所知，根据我们的政府制度，执行机关对于美国国会各委员会……是没有法律权力可以过问的。……我的政府……感到遗憾……。”
    同一天，美国总统艾森豪威尔也亲自出马，在记者招待会上强调美国政府和国会的“分权”，要求加拿大不要“非难”美国政府。
    人们在美国的外交纪录中看到过无数的充满了伪善、欺诈和蛮不讲理的文件，但这回给加拿大的照会却不能不说是一个新纪录。每一个稍有外交常识的人都不会不知道：无论根据国际法或美国宪法，美国总统和国务院都是对外代表美国的。然而它们竟能够泰然自若地对加拿大政府把自己在诺曼事件上的责任推得干干净净。也许，美国总统和国务院认为：对待加拿大这样的“盟国”，把它当作白痴一样愚弄几句，也就可以搪塞过去了。因此，艾森豪威尔在上述的记者招待会上就用一种家长告诫子弟的口吻说，“这件事（指诺曼事件）现在能够放下来”了！
    左右手的撕斗
    可是，尽管华盛顿的右手急于“放下来”，无奈它的左手并不甘愿背黑锅。同国务院比较，美国国会的麦卡锡分子毕竟头脑简单一些。他们还不懂得玩弄“真诚哀悼”这种假慈悲，而是急于要证明自己不过是奉命行凶。因此，在美国国务院答复加拿大的第二天，参议院国内安全小组委员会就赶紧发表声明说：它发表迫害诺曼的材料，是经过国务院“同意”的。而且，国务院还同美国的特务机关联邦调查局一道，事先“核对”和“确证”了这些材料。这一来，美国政府的所谓“分权”论也就全部露底了。右手上戴着的白手套，一下子就被自己的左手撕下来，赤裸裸地显出了国务院的满手血污。
    事情到了这步田地，但美国政府还要继续愚弄加拿大和世界舆论。美国参议院的倒霉声明发表后几小时，华盛顿的麦卡锡分子和国务院忽又言归于好，一个去要求美国通讯社把那个揭露真相的声明“撤回”，另一个则在国务院召开记者招待会，重复已经破了产的胡扯，继续声称仍是不负任何责任。华盛顿的这一手，等于是向加拿大宣告：即使你眼看着我行凶；可是我不承认，你能奈我何！
    杀鸡给猴看
    其实，美国这种蛮干态度也不是今天开始的。早在1951年，当美国开始指控诺曼“不忠诚”的时候，加拿大政府就曾对诺曼进行了“彻底查究”，结果认为诺曼是“忠诚”的和可以“完全信赖”。即使这样，加拿大还是作了让步，把诺曼从联合国远远地调往新西兰和埃及。可是，美国却像沙漠上空的鹰鹫，对它看中的目标死追不放，一定要置之死地而后已。死了以后，也不容别人“喊冤”。
    看来，华盛顿显然认为死个把诺曼正是它杀鸡给猴子看的好机会，以便今后能更有效地继续进行它的“忠诚调查”，好好地管一管，它本国的和“盟国”的子民们。不过，毕竟这回也有棘手处，因为除了引起加拿大全国沸腾之外，伦敦、东京等处也对美国提出了“雨点般的谴责”，美国国内也有些人觉得这件事“代价太高”了。这样，美国政府和国会才不得不各自演几手“善后”戏来平伏一下风波。可是，他们也并不演得怎么认真，演员们甚至懒于事先对对台词，结果自相撕打，越演越糟。
    对所谓“自由世界”的人们来说，诺曼事件应该是很有教育意义的：即使像诺曼这样受到他的本国政府“完全信赖”的上层人物，在美国眼里也如此一文不值！即使像加拿大这样“忠实”于美国的政府，美国对待它也是不择手段的。难怪英国的“泰晤士报”也惊呼道：诺曼事件是“悲剧也是警告”！（附图片）
