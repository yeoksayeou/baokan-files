Xinhua News Agency, April 13th: (Xinhua News Agency reporter Sun Shikai reports:) A number of writers and literary theorists in Beijing are discussing the question of socialist realism.

The discussion of this issue was sparked by the publication of He Zhi's "Realism - A Broad Road" and Zhang Guangnian's "Socialist Realism Exists and Develops" in "People's Literature" and "Literary Gazette," respectively. The Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles has been organizing this discussion since February of this year.

Some people have questioned socialist realism, arguing that the reality of socialist times and the writer's worldview inherently possess a socialist spirit, so the depiction of socialist reality naturally includes socialist thought. Others believe that the key lies in the cultivation and training of the writer's thoughts and feelings; if the writer possesses proletarian thoughts and feelings, their works will have educational significance. If a writer wants to add a concept of "using the socialist spirit to ideologically transform and educate the working people" in addition to image creation, it will inevitably lead to formulaic and conceptual works. These people believe that films like "Hero Driver" and "Happy Tomorrow," and similar works, are ideologically 100% correct, but lack artistic life. However, Cao Xueqin's "Dream of the Red Chamber" and Mao Dun's "Midnight," etc., do not explicitly state what kind of thought should be used to educate the people, but produce political effects due to the artistic image of the works. They believe that this shows that it is not the socialist realism method of creation that gives excellent works ideological and artistic quality, but the writer's thoughts and feelings. At the same time, socialist realism provides an excuse for dogmatic critics, causing works such as Wang Meng's "The Young Man Who Arrived at the Organization Department" to be subjected to such complete negation criticism. Dogmatists often judge works based on concepts. Therefore, the concept of socialist realism is better changed to realism of the socialist era, which will reduce unnecessary concerns brought to writers throughout the entire artistic practice, and allow writers to create more boldly.

However, some people disagree with the above arguments. They believe that the current exploration of socialist realism helps to break the shackles of dogmatism. However, socialist realism, although not the only one, is the best creative method. It is not permissible to separate socialism and realism, to deny the superiority of socialist realism literature, let alone to abolish it because some people understand it with dogmatic thinking methods. Those who advocate realism of the socialist era equate the progressive literature of the past with the current socialist realism literature. In fact, although the old realist works are mature in art, they often fail to thoroughly criticize the old society, and their yearning for the new society is not clear enough. However, socialist realism works encourage people's enthusiasm for building socialism and consolidate their confidence in building socialism with collectivism and optimism. Therefore, they disagree with blaming the emergence of some formulaic and conceptual works in recent years on the promotion of socialist realism. The emergence of formulaic conceptualization in works is mainly due to the writer's lack of life experience and low artistic level. When criticizing our current literary situation, we should not obliterate the superiority shown by socialist realism in the development of literature in our country. From the works since the "May Fourth" Movement to "The White-Haired Girl" and "Liu Hulan," their touching power has developed with the increase of socialist elements.

Whether literary works should cooperate with political tasks is also an issue involved in this discussion. Some people believe that emphasizing literary works to cooperate with political tasks makes it easy for creation to deviate from the reality of life and only obey and serve concepts. People who hold this view say that during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, the revolutionary situation required literary works to become the fastest and most direct propaganda weapon, requiring writers to write works according to policy provisions, as long as they were more vivid than empty talk, but the situation after the national liberation was different. The people's lives and social environment have undergone tremendous changes, and the people's ability to appreciate art has improved, but the theoretical guiding ideology is conservative, resulting in literary dogmatism. Some people at the discussion meeting disagreed with this view, advocating that literary works should have both ideology and artistry, and should not set works that cooperate with political tasks against other literary and artistic works. It can only be said that some works that cooperate with political tasks are not well written, and they must not be completely negated. Lu Xun's essays closely cooperated with political tasks, and everyone admits that they are good. In the struggle against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary clique, good essays such as those written by Zhang Tianyi and Cao Yu also appeared.

The discussion on socialist realism also touched on issues such as writing truthfully, writing about characters, expanding creative themes, and literary leadership ideology. Some people also believe that the current debate on socialist realism is not very important, the main thing is to "bring out the goods" (the so-called goods refer to excellent works and profound criticisms).

At present, this discussion is only a beginning. The Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles is preparing to continue to organize discussions through large-scale discussion meetings, small forums, and writing articles. New discoveries of cultural relics

### 社会主义现实主义是什么？  北京市文艺界展开热烈讨论

    社会主义现实主义是什么？
    北京市文艺界展开热烈讨论
    新华社13日讯　新华社记者孙世恺报道：北京市的一些作家和文艺理论家正在探讨关于社会主义现实主义问题。
    这个问题的讨论是从“人民文学”和“文艺报”先后发表何直的“现实主义——广阔的道路”和张光年的“社会主义现实主义存在着、发展着”的文章以后引起的。北京市文学艺术工作者联合会从今年2月开始就组织了这个讨论。
    有些人对社会主义现实主义提出质疑，认为社会主义时代的现实生活和作家的世界观就有社会主义精神，所以在描写社会主义时代的现实生活时自然包括了社会主义思想。还有人认为问题的关键在于作家思想感情的修养和锻炼，作家有了无产阶级的思想感情，他所写出的作品就有教育意义。如果作家想在形象创造之外另加点“用社会主义精神从思想上去改造和教育劳动人民”的概念，必然导致作品的公式化概念化。这些人认为像“英雄司机”、“幸福的明天”等电影和类似的作品，在思想上百分之百正确，就是缺乏艺术生命。可是，曹雪芹的“红楼梦”、茅盾的“子夜”等，都没有明说要用什么思想教育人民，却由于作品的艺术形象而产生了政治效果。他们认为，这表明不是社会主义现实主义创作方法给予优秀作品以思想性和艺术性，而是作家的思想感情。同时，社会主义现实主义给教条主义批评家找到借口，致使像王蒙的“组织部新来的青年人”等作品遭到那样一些全部否定的批评。教条主义者往往是从概念出发去评判作品的。因之，社会主义现实主义的概念不如改为社会主义时代的现实主义更为确切，这将减少作家在整个艺术实践过程中带来的不必要的顾虑，使作家更加大胆地创作。
    但是有些人不同意上述论调。他们认为目前对社会主义现实主义的探讨，是有助于破除教条主义的束缚。但是，社会主义现实主义虽不是唯一的却是最好的创作方法，不容把社会主义和现实主义分割开，否认社会主义现实主义文学的优越性，更不能因为有人用教条主义的思想方法去理解它就加以取消。主张社会主义时代的现实主义的人，是把过去的进步文学和现在的社会主义现实主义文学等量齐观了。实际上旧现实主义的作品，尽管在艺术上是成熟的，但往往批判旧社会不能彻底，对新社会的憧憬也不够明确。可是社会主义现实主义作品，以集体主义和乐观主义鼓舞人们建设社会主义的热情并巩固建设社会主义的信心。所以，他们不同意有人把近年来产生一些公式化、概念化的作品，归罪于提倡社会主义现实主义的缘故。作品中出现公式化概念化，主要是作家缺乏生活经验和艺术水平不高。在批评我们的文艺现状时，不应抹煞社会主义现实主义在我国文学发展上所显示的优越性，从“五四”以来的作品到“白毛女”、“刘胡兰”，其感人的力量是随着社会主义的成份的加大而发展的。
    文学作品应否配合政治任务？也是这次讨论所涉及的一个问题。有人认为强调文学作品配合政治任务，就易于使创作远离生活的真实，只服从和服务于概念。抱着这样论点的人说，在抗日战争和解放战争时期，革命的形势需要文学作品成为最迅速最直接的宣传武器，要求作家根据政策条文写作品，只要比空口讲白话更形象些就可以，但是全国解放后的形势就不同了，人民生活和社会环境发生了巨大的变化，人民欣赏艺术的能力提高了，可是理论指导思想是守旧的，从而产生文学上的教条主义。讨论会上有人不同意这样的意见，主张文学作品要思想性，也要艺术性，不能把配合政治任务的作品和其他文艺作品对立起来，只能说有些配合政治任务的作品没有写好，决不能一概否定它。鲁迅的杂文紧密地配合政治任务，谁都承认是好的。在和胡风反革命集团的斗争中，也出现过像张天翼、曹禺所写的那样好的杂文。
    在社会主义现实主义的讨论中，还接触到这样一些问题：如写真实、写人物、扩大创作题材和文艺领导思想等问题。也有人认为当前对社会主义现实主义的争论并不很重要，主要是“拿出货色来”（所谓货色是指优秀作品和深刻的批评）。
    目前，这个讨论还只是一个开端。北京市文学艺术工作者联合会准备采取大型讨论会、小型座谈会及写文章等方式继续组织讨论。新发现的文物
