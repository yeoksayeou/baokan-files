Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 25th. Shandong provincial leading organs recently discovered that a small number of Communist Party member cadres have undesirable behaviors such as not supporting their parents, not raising their children, and mistreating the elderly. This situation has created a very negative impact on the Party among the masses.

	Lou Jianhua, a cadre of the Political Propaganda Section of the Propaganda Department of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee, rarely sent money home to support his elderly parents. As a result, the elderly could not repay their grain debts to the agricultural cooperative, affecting the cooperative's capital turnover. Wang Junyi, of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee's Commission for Discipline Inspection, is an old cadre with elderly parents and young children at home, but for more than ten years, he deliberately avoided communicating with his family in order to shirk his responsibility for supporting his elderly parents and raising his children. It was not until recently, after criticism from the masses, that he made contact with his family. Li Xiao, a female cadre of the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, has a mother who is over sixty years old and usually washes clothes, cooks, and takes care of children for her daughter and son-in-law, and sometimes even washes her daughter's hair. Once, Li Xiao asked the old woman to stir-fry chili peppers for her, and the old woman fainted from the smoke, but Li Xiao stayed in bed without moving. Zhang Jiyu, a female cadre and Party member, has a father-in-law who is seventy-nine years old. Because he was unable to work, he came from the countryside to live with his son. Zhang Jiyu quarreled with her husband about this every day. One day, over a trivial matter, Zhang Jiyu unreasonably made a scene, smashed a lot of furniture, and verbally abused and beat the old man, causing dissatisfaction among the nearby masses.

	Currently, these undesirable behaviors of Party member cadres have attracted the attention of provincial leading organs. The Party Committee of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee recently issued a circular on this matter, calling on Party organizations at all levels to overcome the incorrect view that "an honest official can hardly settle family disputes," and requiring them to regularly strengthen communist moral education for Party members, strictly enforce organizational life, conduct criticism and self-criticism, and establish a new atmosphere of "respecting the old and cherishing the young" in handling family life.

    负起赡养父母抚养子女的责任
    山东加强对党员干部的共产主义道德教育
    新华社济南25日电　山东省级领导机关最近发现少数共产党员干部有不赡养父母、不抚养子女和虐待老人等不良行为。这种情况给党在群众中造成很不好的影响。
    中共山东省委宣传部政治宣传处的干部娄建华，因为很少寄钱回家赡养年老的父母，老人们不能归还农业社的口粮欠款，结果影响了社里的资金周转。中共山东省委监察委员会的王均益，是个老干部，家中有老有小，但他十余年来故意不和家中通信，以推卸赡养老人和抚养子女的责任。直到最近经过群众的批评，他才同家中取得联系。省工会的女干部李晓，她的母亲已经六十多岁了，平日替女儿、女婿洗衣服、做饭、看孩子，有时候还得替女儿洗头。有一次李晓要老人家炒辣椒给她吃，老人被烟熏昏倒了，李晓却睡在床上一动也不动。女干部张继玉是个党员，她的公公已经七十九岁，因无力劳动才从乡下来到儿子这里，张继玉为了这事整天和丈夫吵闹。有一天因为一件小事，张继玉借此无理取闹，摔了好多家具，还辱骂和殴打老人，引起附近群众不满。
    目前，党员干部的这些不良行为已经引起省级领导机关的重视。中共山东省委机关委员会最近曾为此发出通报，号召所属各级党组织克服“清官难断家务事”的不正确看法，要求经常加强对党员进行共产主义的道德教育，严格组织生活，开展批评与自我批评，在处理家庭生活上树立“尊老爱幼”的新风气。
