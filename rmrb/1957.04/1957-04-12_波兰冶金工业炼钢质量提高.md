Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, April 10th: According to a Polish Press Agency report, the proportion of substandard steel in Poland's steel production in March fell to 2.8%. This is the best steelmaking quality indicator achieved by Poland's metallurgical industry since 1945.

In the first quarter of this year, Poland's metallurgical industry overproduced approximately 20,000 tons of steel, 35,000 tons of steel products, and 9,500 tons of pig iron.

In this year and the following years, Poland's metallurgical industry will continue to increase production by improving technology and better utilizing existing enterprise equipment. The increase in steel production this year due to improved labor organization and operating procedures in various steel plants will be equivalent to the annual steel production of a medium-sized steel plant. The implementation of specialized division of labor in various steel rolling mills will result in an additional production of approximately 15,000 tons of steel products this year. Fully utilizing the production capacity of existing enterprises will increase pig iron production by 5% this year.

At the same time, some major metallurgical industrial projects in Poland are continuing to expand. The famous Lenin Metallurgical Combine in Nowa Huta will begin construction of its third blast furnace this year, which is expected to be put into operation in the first quarter of 1958. In addition, three open-hearth furnaces will be completed in 1960. The cold-rolled sheet plant under construction at this combine will be completed next year.

In order to more fully supply raw materials to the metallurgical industry, Poland is striving to increase the mining volume of iron ore. The results of large-scale exploration in the past few years show that, among Poland's resources, the first batch of iron ore suitable for mining is approximately 500 million tons, of which 100 million tons are already being mined or are about to be mined.

    波兰冶金工业炼钢质量提高
    新华社华沙10日电　据波兰通讯社报道，在今年3月份波兰产的钢铁中，次品下降到2.8％。这是波兰冶金工业自从1945年以来所达到的最好的炼钢质量指标。
    今年第一季度，波兰的冶金工业超额生产了约两万吨钢、三万五千吨钢材和九千五百吨生铁。
    波兰冶金工业在今年和以后几年中，将通过改进技术和更好地利用现有企业设备来继续提高生产。今年各炼钢厂由于改进劳动组织和操作规程而增加的钢产量，将相当于一个中型炼钢厂一年炼钢的数量。各种轧钢厂由于实行专门化的分工，今年将多生产约一万五千吨钢材。充分利用现有企业的生产能力将使今年的生铁产量提高5％。
    同时，波兰一些大的冶金工业工程正在继续扩展。诺瓦胡塔著名的列宁冶金联合企业今年将开始建造第三座高炉，预计到1958年第一季度可以投入生产。另有三座平炉将在1960年建成。这个联合企业正在建设的冷轧薄板厂将在明年完工。
    为了更充分地供应冶金工业原料，波兰正在努力提高铁矿砂的开采量。过去几年大规模勘探的结果表明，在波兰的资源中，第一批适于开采的铁矿砂大约有五亿吨，其中已经在开采和即将开采的有一亿吨。
