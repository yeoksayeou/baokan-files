Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, April 1st (TASS): Syrian Acting Minister of Defense Azem, in response to questions from a reporter from the Pakistan Press International, refuted the lies spread by Western propaganda organs regarding Soviet interference in Syria's internal affairs.

Azem said: "The Soviet Union has indeed earned our respect because its position on Arab issues during our serious and difficult times has been favorable to us. Its position is different from that of the West, which has deepened our difficulties and complicated the course of events."

He said: "The West tells us that communism is the enemy of the East. However, I must say that no one interferes in our affairs and harms our sovereignty and independence like the West. The West is trying to drag us into military blocs, which is not in our interests, but the Soviet Union has not shown even the slightest sign of interfering in our affairs. The Soviet Union does not want our territory as a military base and has never supported our enemies."

Speaking of the so-called "communist threat" to the countries of the Near and Middle East, Azem said: "We believe that the only danger that threatens us is the danger arising from the imperialist conspiracies of Israel, France, and Britain, not communism. We hope to maintain a policy of positive neutrality and not participate in any blocs."

    叙官方驳斥西方对苏联的诬蔑
    指出干涉叙利亚的是西方
    据新华社2日讯　据塔斯社大马士革1日讯：叙利亚代理国防部长阿泽姆在回答巴基斯坦通讯社记者的问题时，驳斥了西方宣传机构散布的关于苏联干涉叙利亚内政的谎言。
    阿泽姆说：“苏联的确赢得了我们的尊敬，因为它在我们的严重而困难的时期对阿拉伯国家问题采取的立场是对我们有利的，它的立场同西方立场不同，西方加深了我们的困难，使事件进程复杂化。”
    他说：“西方对我们说，共产主义是东方的敌人。然而我应当说，没有谁会像西方那样干涉我国事务，损害我们的主权和独立。西方力图把我们拖进军事集团，这是不符合我们的利益的，然而苏联连干涉我们事务的一点迹象都没有。苏联不要我们的领土做军事基地，从来不支持我们的敌人。”
    谈到对中近东各国的所谓“共产主义威胁”的时候，阿泽姆说：“我们认为，使我们感到威胁的唯一危险，是由以色列、法国和英国的帝国主义阴谋产生的危险，而不是共产主义。我们希望保持积极中立政策，不参加任何集团”。
