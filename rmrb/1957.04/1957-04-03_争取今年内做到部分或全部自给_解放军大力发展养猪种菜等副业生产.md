Xinhua News Agency, April 2nd – Various units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are vigorously developing sideline production such as pig raising and vegetable growing, striving to achieve partial or complete self-sufficiency in non-staple foods within this year.

The troops on the Fujian front have already raised more than 8,000 pigs. According to the plan, the Fujian front troops will be self-sufficient in half of their meat consumption this year. A certain unit stationed in the Putian area has opened up more than 60 mu of vegetable gardens using barren hills and beaches, and various spring-sown vegetables have already sprouted. The officers and soldiers guarding a certain island have raised flocks of chickens and ducks, cultivated a large amount of seaweed in the sea, and also planted spinach and cabbage in the crevices of the rocks. Now this island-guarding unit is already able to be 80% self-sufficient in vegetables.

In the warm climate of Hainan Island, the military leadership organs have proposed that the target for the troops' sideline production this year is: an average of one pig raised per ten people, and 15%-30% self-sufficiency in vegetables. The naval officers and soldiers stationed on a certain small island off the coast of Guangdong had a total value of sideline production of approximately 150,000 yuan last year. This year, they are determined to expand the scale of sideline production, to achieve complete self-sufficiency in firewood, more than half self-sufficiency in vegetables, and an average of two chickens raised per person, 15 to 17 jin of pork produced, and three to five fruit trees planted. On a certain island in Zhejiang Province, some companies have been able to be more than 70% self-sufficient in vegetables in recent months. The military leadership organs require all units to basically achieve complete self-sufficiency in vegetables this year.

The officers and soldiers stationed in Wuhan, Lanzhou, Kunming, Shenyang, Chengdu and other regions are also vigorously developing sideline production. A certain unit stationed in the Kunming area has decided to plant 150 mu of vegetables this year, raise an average of one pig per two people, and achieve complete self-sufficiency in vegetables and meat. A certain unit stationed in the Shenyang area plans to produce more than 8 million jin of vegetables this year and is currently preparing seeds and tools. The Changdu area supply station overcame the difficulties of high altitude, severe ice and snow, and thin air, raising 300 pigs and producing more than 470,000 jin of vegetables last year, which can solve part of the non-staple food supply for the automobile troops and passing soldiers on the Kangzang Highway. This year, they have decided to further develop sideline production, striving to be 30% self-sufficient in meat and vegetables.

Currently, various units are learning from each other's experience in developing sideline production in order to further reduce costs and increase output. A pig farm of a logistics department in the Shanghai area has attracted the attention of many logistics workers in the troops. From March 1955 to August 1956, the number of pigs raised in this pig farm increased from 150 to 731. The cost of raising pigs is very low, with an average daily feed cost of only eight to ten fen per pig. In addition to supplying all the meat needed by the troops, this pig farm has successively sold 111 sows, breeding pigs, and piglets to fraternal units, and sold some of the best pigs to the state for export.

    争取今年内做到部分或全部自给
    解放军大力发展养猪种菜等副业生产
    新华社2日讯　中国人民解放军各部队正在大力发展养猪、种菜等副业生产，争取在今年内做到副食品部分或全部自给。
    福建前线各部队已经养猪八千多头。按照计划，福建前线部队在今年将自给肉食二分之一。驻在莆田地区某部利用荒山、海滩开拓了菜园六十多亩，春播的各种蔬菜已经长出嫩芽。守卫在某海岛上的部队官兵养了成群鸡鸭，在海里种了大批紫菜，还在岩石缝里种上了菠菜、白菜，现在这支守岛部队已经能够自给菜蔬80％。
    在气候温暖的海南岛，驻军领导机关提出了今年部队副业生产的指标是：平均每十人养猪一头，自给蔬菜15％—30％。驻守在广东沿海某小岛上的海军官兵，去年全年副业生产的总值约值十五万元，今年他们决心扩大副业生产的规模，做到烧柴全部自给，蔬菜一半以上自给，全部队平均每人养鸡两只、生产猪肉十五斤至十七斤、种果树三棵至五棵。在浙江省的某岛，近几个月来有的连队已经能够自给蔬菜70％以上，驻军领导机关要求各单位在今年基本上做到蔬菜全部自给。
    武汉、兰州、昆明、沈阳、成都等地区的驻军官兵，也都在大力发展副业生产。昆明地区驻军某部决定今年种菜一百五十亩，平均每两人养猪一头，做到蔬菜和肉食全部自给。驻沈阳地区某部今年计划生产蔬菜八百多万斤，目前正在筹备种子和工具。昌都地区兵站克服了高原冰雪严寒、空气稀薄的困难，去年养猪三百头，生产蔬菜四十七万多斤，可以解决康藏公路上汽车部队和过往军人的一部分副食供应。今年他们决定进一步发展副业生产，争取自给肉食和蔬菜30％。
    现在，各部队正在互相学习开展副业生产的经验，以便进一步降低成本、增加产量。上海地区一个后勤部的养猪场，已引起了许多部队后勤工作者的注意。这个养猪场从1955年3月到1956年8月，饲养的猪由一百五十头繁殖到七百三十一头；养猪的成本很低，每头猪的饲料费平均每天只有八分到一角。这个养猪场除了供应部队所需要的全部肉食以外，先后卖给兄弟部队母猪、种猪、仔猪一百十一头，并且把一部分最好的猪卖给国家作出口之用。（附图片）
