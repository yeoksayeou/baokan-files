    Studying Chairman Mao's Speech at the Supreme State Conference
    Correctly Handling Contradictions Among the People
    Central Government Organs Party Committee Requires Integration with Reality
    (Dispatch from this newspaper) The Party Committee of the Central Government Organs of the Chinese Communist Party recently convened an enlarged meeting of the Party Committee to examine the study situation of cadres in various organs regarding Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." At the meeting, Comrade Yang Shangkun, Secretary of the Party Committee, gave specific instructions on how the various organs should further study Chairman Mao's speech in depth.
    After listening to Chairman Mao's speech at the Supreme State Conference, the responsible comrades of various organs and units directly under the Central Government conveyed it to all cadres and generally conducted symposiums and discussions after the transmission. Party cadres who had heard the transmission generally believed that, with the thorough victory of the democratic revolution and the decisive victory of the socialist revolution already achieved throughout the country, and with contradictions among the people having become a prominent issue, Chairman Mao's timely raising of this issue has extremely important guiding significance for current and future work. However, because it was only a preliminary study and discussion, generally speaking, the understanding of the spirit of the speech is still very superficial. At the same time, the discussion is limited to the content of the speech, and the connection with reality is very poor. Some comrades still have some confused ideas.
    For this reason, Comrade Yang Shangkun emphasized the importance of studying Chairman Mao's speech at the enlarged meeting of the Party Committee and asked comrades to connect it with the Party's current major policies and guidelines, with the work of the organs, and with their thinking, in order to improve understanding and improve the work of the organs. Therefore, Party organizations in various organs should strengthen the organization and leadership of the study, and should regard leading this study as the focus of the Party's ideological work at present. They should also allocate a period of time to seriously study and discuss the speech in conjunction with the specific work of their organs and the ideological situation of the cadres.

    学习毛主席在最高国务会议上的讲话
    正确地处理人民内部的矛盾问题
    中直党委要求联系实际
    本报讯　中共中央直属机关党委会，日前召开了党委扩大会，检查各机关干部对毛主席在最高国务会议上“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题”的讲话的学习情况。会上，党委书记杨尚昆同志对各机关如何进一步地深入学习毛主席这个讲话作了具体指示。
    中直各机关各单位负责同志在听了毛主席在最高国务会议上的讲话后，都分别向全体干部作了传达，传达后普遍进行了座谈和讨论。党内干部听过传达后普遍认为，在民主革命已经彻底胜利和社会主义革命已经在全国范围内取得决定性胜利、人民内部矛盾已经成为突出问题的今天，毛主席及时地提出这一问题，对当前的工作与今后的工作都有极其重大的指导作用。但是因为仅是初步的学习和讨论，一般说来，对讲话的精神理解还很肤浅；同时讨论还限于讲话的内容，联系实际很差，有些同志还存有一些糊涂思想。
    为此，杨尚昆同志在党委扩大会上着重讲述了学习毛主席这个讲话的重要性，要求同志们联系当前党的重大政策、方针，联系机关工作，联系思想，以求得提高认识，改进机关工作。因此，各机关中的党组织应加强学习的组织和领导，应把领导这次学习作为当前党的思想工作的重心，并结合本机关的具体工作情况和干部的思想情况，划出一段时间，认真地学习和讨论。
