Promote Putonghua in Different Ways According to Actual Conditions
Chen Runzhai

It is undeniable that China's writing system must, under certain conditions, move towards the common phonetic direction of world writing systems. It is also undeniable that we must vigorously promote Putonghua with Northern dialect as the basic dialect and Beijing pronunciation as the standard sound, unify the language of the Han nationality, and pave the way for the fundamental reform of the writing system. The Party and the government attach great importance to this work. Since the National Conference on Writing Reform and the Academic Conference on the Standardization of Modern Chinese were held in 1955, the State Council has issued instructions on promoting Putonghua, calling on the people of the Han nationality across the country to vigorously promote Putonghua; the Ministry of Education has also issued instructions on vigorously promoting Putonghua in primary and secondary schools and teacher training schools at all levels, calling on primary and secondary schools and teacher training schools at all levels across the country to implement the resolutions of the National Conference on Writing Reform, gradually use Putonghua for teaching, and enable students to learn Putonghua. This is a major event in the lives of the Chinese people.

In the past year, various places have begun to pay attention to the work of promoting Putonghua. For example, holding Beijing pronunciation training classes for primary and secondary school Chinese teachers; holding radio lectures on Putonghua pronunciation teaching, and organizing teachers to learn; requiring the gradual use of Putonghua for teaching in primary and secondary schools and teacher training schools; conducting dialect surveys; and helping organizations and groups learn Putonghua, etc. However, according to reports, the first semester of 1956 was quite enthusiastic, but the second semester was somewhat lukewarm.

The reasons for this situation are, of course, various, but the most important one is that some people regard the promotion of Putonghua as too simple, believing that as long as a call is made, there is no need to do much work, and everyone will learn it. This is due to a lack of understanding of the complexity of China's language divergence, and a lack of understanding that China's language divergence was caused by a long historical development process, and it is impossible to eliminate it in a short period of time through a call or a movement and achieve language unity. Promoting Putonghua is a long-term, meticulous and arduous task. The differences between Chinese dialects are very large, and the distance from Beijing pronunciation varies. When we promote Beijing pronunciation, we cannot expect all regions to advance at the same pace, nor should we have the impetuous emotion of achieving success overnight. We advocate adopting the principle of focusing on promotion and gradually popularizing according to the language conditions of various dialect areas and the convenience or inconvenience of learning conditions, and carrying out the promotion work. This principle is very clear and very suitable for objective reality. We should put forward different requirements and adopt different methods to carry out the promotion work according to different regions and different objects.

First of all, schools are an important front for promoting Putonghua. Primary and secondary schools and teacher training schools at all levels across the country should earnestly implement the "Instructions on Vigorously Promoting Putonghua in Primary and Secondary Schools and Teacher Training Schools" issued by the Ministry of Education, promote Putonghua teaching, and expand its dissemination. The requirements for primary schools should be higher. Because the primary school stage is the best time to learn pronunciation. Children's hearing is the most sensitive, their vocal organs and various tissues are the most flexible, and pronunciation learning is very easy. As long as a good foundation is laid in the primary school stage, a correct Putonghua can be learned in combination with language practice in the middle school stage. Teacher training schools are places for training teachers, and the requirements should be higher.

Teachers' pronunciation should be accurate, and they should master systematic phonetic knowledge as much as possible, and understand the corresponding rules between Beijing pronunciation and dialect pronunciation. Therefore, organizing teachers to learn is still a very necessary task. In the future, teachers can be organized to learn during winter and summer vacations or busy farming seasons for centralized learning. Or take decentralized spare time learning. When organizing spare time learning, it should be carried out in an organized and planned manner, emphasizing self-consciousness, and persevering to the end, avoiding randomness. Where conditions permit, rotational training can be adopted. The educational bureaus can sponsor rotational training for teachers, or they can entrust it to teacher colleges or teacher training colleges. Radio teaching lectures are a very good method. It is convenient for teachers to learn and further their studies, and it is also convenient for the general public to learn, and it can be fully utilized.

Generally speaking, the requirements for teachers in urban schools to teach in Putonghua should be higher than those for teachers in rural schools, the requirements for young teachers should be higher than those for older teachers, and the requirements for Chinese teachers should be higher than those for other teachers. But no matter whether the requirements are high or low, they cannot be achieved all at once, and conditions must be actively prepared to gradually achieve them. Any excuse saying: "Putonghua teaching is a matter for Chinese teachers and has nothing to do with subject teachers," "I'm too old, my tongue is stiff, I can't learn it, let's forget it!" "It's hard to change my local accent, it's more convenient and habitual to teach with local sounds," etc., are all wrong.

Students must first learn phonetic symbols (in the future, they will be phonetic alphabets) as "pronunciation crutches", and read out the initials, finals, and tones accurately according to the phonetic symbols. On this basis, gradually learn Putonghua in combination with phonetic practice. However, gradual requirements should also be put forward according to different grades. For example, in the primary school stage, in addition to requiring lower grade students to learn to speak Putonghua from the beginning of school, they should focus on requiring them to be able to spell, listen to sounds, accurately read out tones, and read texts aloud in Putonghua. In the middle grades, they are required not only to use Putonghua when answering questions, summarizing the main points, and dictating in class, but also to speak Putonghua outside of class. In the fifth and sixth grades, they can be required to read aloud and speak in Putonghua, and all gatherings and activities, such as recitations, speeches, storytelling, and acting, should use Putonghua. As for middle schools and teacher training schools, not only are they required to read aloud and speak in Putonghua, but they should also understand basic phonetic knowledge and the corresponding rules between dialect and Beijing pronunciation, especially teacher training students. Of course, this requirement needs teachers to provide assistance in many ways to achieve it.

Secondly, different requirements should also be made for different regions. Of course, the requirements for the northern provinces and provinces belonging to the so-called "Mandarin-speaking area" should be higher than those for provinces with complex dialects. Because the pronunciation of the northern provinces and the provinces belonging to the so-called "Mandarin-speaking area" is not too different from Beijing pronunciation, only some pronunciations and vocabulary and tones are somewhat different. As for the dialects in dialect areas, the pronunciation is too different from Beijing pronunciation, and it is almost impossible to understand each other when talking, like languages of different systems. Therefore, the promotion work should be carried out realistically according to the different situations in various places, and it should not be limited to one standard and forced to be consistent.

People in dialect areas should first correct their pronunciation when learning Putonghua, and it is not necessary to require too much for light tones, retroflex endings, and tones. For example, some provinces once put forward the slogan "People from dialects come in, people from Beijing go out" during the short-term training of teachers, which is an excessive requirement. This will not only fail to meet the requirements, but also easily make learners feel that Putonghua is difficult to learn and lose confidence. We should try our best to get more people to learn Putonghua and expand its scope of use. In the provinces of the so-called "Mandarin-speaking area", especially the northern provinces, the pronunciation difference is not big, and the focus can be on correcting the tones and the pronunciation of some words. For example, when Shandong Province held Beijing pronunciation training classes for Chinese teachers in middle schools and teacher training schools last year, they learned the tones first and then practiced reading aloud, and the effect was very good. However, in some areas close to Beijing, many people think that it is basically Putonghua, and the difference in individual pronunciations can be solved in daily life, and there is no need to organize learning again. Many people also think that promoting Putonghua is just learning a few letters. This understanding is also incorrect.

Each local sound, whether near or far from Beijing pronunciation, can find corresponding rules with Beijing pronunciation. People who learn can master these rules, and they don't need to learn one sound at a time, and it is easier to correct pronunciation. Now all provinces and cities have launched dialect surveys in order to find these rules and help people in various places learn Putonghua as soon as possible. We must make full use of phonetic symbols or phonetic alphabets to learn Putonghua. We must regard phonetic symbols as "pronunciation crutches". On this basis, we can gradually develop the ability to listen and distinguish sounds, so that the ears are familiar with the initials, finals, and tones of Beijing pronunciation, and can understand other people's reading and speaking. On this basis, we can master a certain number of Beijing pronunciations of words and gradually apply them to our own language.

Learning Beijing pronunciation to correct dialects is not an easy task. In order to learn Putonghua, you need to study hard, study diligently, speak more, and use more. At the beginning, there will inevitably be mixed accents, but after some effort, you will gradually become proficient.

The general public should not be rushed when learning Putonghua, and it should be determined according to the public's understanding and specific conditions. Vigorously call on, make full use of wired broadcasting, agricultural cooperative propagandists, cultural centers, stations, etc., to carry out extensive publicity, cite vivid examples to illustrate the important significance of promoting Putonghua, so that the public can clearly understand the close relationship between promoting Putonghua and the socialist construction of the motherland, and gradually eliminate the public's ideological resistance and concerns. This work can only be completed under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, actively mobilizing the masses, unifying understanding, and unifying goals.

According to the principle of voluntary participation, promoting Putonghua among the masses should not be forced or prohibited from speaking dialects. Otherwise, it will cause dissatisfaction among the masses and cause setbacks in the work.

At present, the main task of people's schools is to eliminate illiteracy. In order to reduce their burden, the teaching of Putonghua can be postponed temporarily. However, for people's schools in cities and towns with better conditions and learning requirements, they must be strongly supported and helped. Urban workers' spare time schools should carry out Putonghua teaching as much as possible. Educational administrative departments at all levels should actively help and organize teachers of people's schools to learn Putonghua, and try to mobilize local people who are enthusiastic about writing reform and promoting Putonghua to participate in the work voluntarily, and organize lectures, reports, Putonghua learning classes, phonetic alphabet training classes, etc. to help the public learn Putonghua. In large, medium, and small cities with a good foundation and better conditions, mass organizations such as writing reform associations and Chinese language associations can be organized to carry out the work of promoting Putonghua.

Vigorously promoting Putonghua and paving the way for the fundamental reform of Chinese writing is a major event related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. It should become the common cause of the broad masses of the people in our country. Therefore, in the promotion work, we must oppose the style of separating from reality and the masses, overcome conservative thinking and the tendency of impetuous advancement, work actively, and move forward steadily.

    根据实际情况采取不同方式推广普通话
    陈润斋
    我国文字必须在一定条件下，走世界文字共同的拼音方向，这是确定不移的。大力推广以北方话为基础方言、以北京语音为标准音的普通话，统一汉民族的语言，为文字根本改革铺平道路，也是确定不移的。党和政府都很重视这项工作。自从1955年举行了全国文字改革会议和现代汉语规范问题学术会议以后，国务院发布了关于推广普通话的指示，号召在全国汉族人民中大力推广普通话；教育部也发布了关于在中小学和各级师范学校大力推广普通话的指示，号召全国中、小学和各级师范学校贯彻执行全国文字改革会议的决议，逐步地用普通话教学，使学生学会普通话。这是我国人民生活中的一件大事。
    一年来各地已开始重视推广普通话的工作。如举办中、小学语文教师北京语音训练班；举办普通话语音教学广播讲座，组织教师学习；要求在中、小学和师范学校中逐步做到使用普通话教学；进行方言调查；帮助机关团体学习普通话等。但据反映，1956年上学期搞的还比较热烈，下学期却有些冷淡了。
    所以产生这样情况，当然有各方面的原因，但最主要的是有些人把推广普通话看得过于简单，认为只要号召一下，用不着作多少工作，大家都会学起来的。这是不了解我国语言分歧的复杂性，不了解我国语言的分歧是在长期历史发展过程中造成的，不可能通过一个号召或一个运动在短期内消除，达到语言的统一。推广普通话是一件长期、细致而又艰巨的工作。汉语方音差别很大，距离北京语音或近或远。我们推广北京语音，不能期望各地齐足并进，也不应有一蹴而致的急躁情绪。我们主张按照各方言地区的语言情况，按照学习条件的便利不便利，采取重点推行，逐步普及的方针，展开推广的工作。这一方针十分明确，十分适合客观实际。我们应根据不同地区，不同对象，提出不同要求，采取不同方式来开展推广工作。
    首先，学校是推广普通话的重要阵地。全国中、小学和各级师范学校应切实贯彻教育部“关于在中、小学和各级师范学校大力推广普通话的指示”，推广普通话教学，扩大它的传播。对小学的要求应高一些。因为小学阶段是学习语音最好的时期。儿童时代听觉最灵敏，发音器官和各种组织最灵活，发音学习非常容易。只要小学阶段打好基础，到中学阶段可结合语言实践，学会正确的普通话。师范学校是培养教师的场所，要求要更高些。
    教师发音要准确，尽可能掌握较系统的语音知识，懂得北京语音跟方音的对应规律。因此组织教师学习仍是十分必要的一项工作。今后组织教师学习，可利用寒暑假或农忙假期进行集中学习。或采取分散的业余学习。在组织业余学习时，要有组织、有计划地进行，强调自觉，坚持到底，避免自流。有条件的可采取轮训方式。轮训教师可由教育厅、局主办，也可委托师范学院或教师进修学院举办。广播教学讲座是一种很好的方法。便利教师的学习和进修，也便利一般群众的学习，可以充分利用。
    一般说来，用普通话教学，对城市学校教师的要求应该高于农村学校教师，对青年教师的要求应该高于老年教师，对语文科教师的要求应该高于其他教师。但无论是高或是低的要求，都不能一下子达到，须要积极准备条件，逐步做到。任何借口说：“普通话教学是语文老师的事，与科任教师无关”，“年纪大了，舌头硬了，学不会了，算了吧！”“乡音难改，还是用本地音教方便、习惯”等等，都是不对的。
    学生首先要学会注音字母（将来是拼音字母）作为“正音拐棍”，依照注音读出声、韵、调，一般准确。在这一基础上，结合语音实践逐步学会普通话。但也应根据不同年级提出逐步的要求。例如在小学阶段，对低年级学生除从入学起就要求他们学说普通话外，应着重要求他们能拼音、听音，准确地读出声调，用普通话朗读课文。到了中年级就要求他们不但在课堂上回答问题、复述大意、口述等都使用普通话，而且也要求他们在课外也说普通话。到了五、六年级，可以要求他们达到朗读和说话都用普通话，一切集会活动，如朗诵会、讲演会、说故事、演戏等都使用普通话。至于中学和师范不但要求他们用普通话朗读和说话，还应该懂得基础的语音知识，以及方音跟北京语音的对应规律，特别是师范学生。当然这一要求，需要教师从多方面给以帮助才能达到。
    其次，对不同地区，也应有不同要求。当然，对北方诸省及属于所谓“官话区”的省份的要求，应该比方言复杂的省份要高些。因为北方诸省及属于所谓“官话区”的省份的语音跟北京语音的差别并不太悬殊，只是一部分字音和词汇以及声调有些差别。至于方言地区的语音跟北京语音悬殊太大，彼此交谈起来，几乎完全不能听懂，像不同体系的语言一样。因此，应根据各地不同情况，实事求是地进行推广工作，不能限制于一个标准，强求一致。
    方言区的人学习普通话应该首先纠正语音，对于轻声、儿化韵、声调等，不必要求过高。如有的省在短期训练教师时，曾提出“方言人进来，北京人出去”的号召，就是一种过高的要求。这样不但达不到要求，而且很容易使学习的人感到普通话难学，失去信心。应尽量争取更多的人学习普通话，扩大它的使用范围。所谓“官话地区”的省份，特别是北方诸省，语音差别不大，可以着重纠正声调和一部分字词的语音。像山东省在去年举办中学师范语文教师北京语音训练班时，先学声调，后练习朗读，效果很好。但是个别接近北京的地区，不少人认为基本上是普通话了，个别字音有差别，在日常生活中可以解决，用不着再组织学习了。也有不少人认为推广普通话也不过是学几个字母罢了。这种认识也是不正确的。
    各地方音，无论距离北京语音或近或远，都可以找出跟北京语音对应的规律。学的人掌握了这些规律，不需再一个音一个音地死学，而正音也较容易。现在各省、市都已展开了方言调查工作，就是为了找出这些规律，帮助各地人民尽快学会普通话。要充分利用注音字母或拼音字母来学习普通话。我们要把注音字母当作“正音拐棍”。在这个基础上，才能逐渐养成听音和辨音的能力，使耳朵熟悉北京语音的声、韵、调，听得懂别人的读书和讲话。在这个基础上，才能掌握一定数量的字的北京语音，逐渐运用到自己的语言中去。
    学习北京语音纠正方言，不是一件轻而易举的事情。为了学会普通话，需要勤学、苦学、多说、多用。开始时，不免会有南腔北调，但经过一番努力以后，会逐渐熟练起来。
    对一般群众学习普通话，不能操之过急，应根据群众的认识程度和具体条件而定。大力号召，充分利用有线广播，农业合作社宣传员，文化馆、站等，进行广泛宣传，多举生动的实例说明推广普通话的重要意义，使群众明确认识推广普通话与祖国社会主义建设的密切关系，逐步消除群众思想上的抵触情绪和顾虑。这一工作，只有在党和政府的正确领导下，积极发动群众，统一认识，统一目标，才能完成。
    根据自觉自愿的原则，在群众中推广普通话，不能强迫命令，也不能禁止他们说方言。不然，会引起群众的不满，使工作遭受挫折。
    目前民校主要任务是扫除文盲。为了减轻他们的负担，可暂缓推广普通话的教学。但对于条件较好的城市集镇而又有学习要求的民校，必须大力支持和帮助。城市职工业余学校应尽可能地开展普通话的教学。各级教育行政部门应积极帮助和组织民校教师学习普通话，尽量发动当地热心文字改革和推广普通话的人士义务参加工作，组织讲演会、报告会、普通话学习班、拼音字母传习班等，帮助群众学习普通话。在有基础和条件较好的大、中、小城市，可组织像文字改革协会、中国语文协会等群众性的组织，来开展推广普通话的工作。
    大力推广普通话，为中国文字根本改革铺平道路，是有关国计民生的一件大事。应当成为我国广大人民群众的共同事业。因此在推广工作中，必须反对脱离实际、脱离群众的作风，克服保守思想和急躁冒进的倾向，积极工作，稳步前进。
