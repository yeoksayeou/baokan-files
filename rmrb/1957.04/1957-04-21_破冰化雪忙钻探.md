Thousands of geological workers in northern and southern Tianshan have successively entered the construction sites. They are carrying out comprehensive activities in the Tianshan Mountains, the Altai Mountains, and the Pamir Plateau.

A certain exploration team working in the western Tianshan Mountains has erected its fourth drilling rig. An exploration team in the Kurutag Mountains is working hard at night under the illumination of carbide lamps. Many exploration teams cannot find water at altitudes of two to three thousand meters above sea level, so they break or melt the ice and snow on the mountains to obtain water, ensuring the progress of exploration work.

The geological exploration team in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has exceeded 10,000 people this year. The task of geological survey and exploration, focusing on oil, coal, and iron, has increased nearly doubled compared to last year.

    破冰化雪忙钻探
    天山南北已经有数千名地质工作者陆续进入工地。他们在天山、阿尔泰山和帕米尔高原上，展开全面活动。
    在天山西部工作的某勘探队已经竖立起第四部钻机。在库鲁塔克山的一支勘探队伍，夜晚在电石灯照明下还紧张地进行山地工作。许多勘探队在拔海两三千公尺的高山上找不到水，就打碎或化开山上的冰块、积雪取水，保证勘探工作的进行。
    新疆维吾尔自治区今年的地质勘探队伍已经超过一万人，以石油、煤、铁为重点的地质普查和勘探任务，比去年增加了将近一倍。
