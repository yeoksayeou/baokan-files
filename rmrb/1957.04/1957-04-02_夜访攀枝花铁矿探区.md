    Night Visit to the Panzhihua Iron Mine Exploration Area
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Cheng Zaihua

    One evening in early March, I accompanied Li Daojian, the deputy captain of the Panzhihua Team of the Sichuan Geological Bureau, and Master Lian Zhentong to the exploration area on the mountain for a nighttime inspection.
    The night sky in Panzhihua in spring is extremely clear. The blue sky is studded with brilliant stars. The night is very quiet, and the flowers on the tall Panzhihua trees fall silently to the ground.
    At the top of Yidou Peak, a refreshing cool breeze blows. By the regular sound of the drilling rig and the lights on the derrick, we identified the locations of some well sites and could also see the lights of a prospecting team’s construction site on the Yunnan Province side across the Jinsha River. The workers there were also spending a sleepless night – searching for coal for steelmaking for the Panzhihua exploration area.
    Fire basins were still lit at the well sites, in stark contrast to the heat at the foot of the subtropical mountain. We inspected the well sites one by one. When we arrived at well site 508, Master Lian checked the operation of the diesel engine, felt the temperature of the circulating water, and then instructed the workers to cool the water down a bit. He then walked to the drilling rig, touched the feed handle, and listened carefully to the sound of the drilling. The 51-year-old worker immediately felt that something was wrong. He suggested pulling the drill. Upon inspection, it turned out that the alloy steel of the drill bit had been worn smooth. The workers replaced the drill bit and drilled again.
    We inspected well site 502, well site 501... Some were operating normally, and some still had minor problems. Under the electric lights after midnight, I saw how joyful everyone's faces looked whenever Master Lian and the workers solved a problem together. Deputy Captain Li told me that the proportion of new workers in this team is very high, and the experienced masters often come to check during the night when work is prone to slack, which can prevent major accidents.
    That night, we completed the main sections of the Panzhihua Iron Mine exploration area. When we went down the mountain, dawn was breaking in the east. The valley echoed with the rhythmic sounds of the diesel engines and drilling rigs at each well site. The drilling workers on the early shift walked towards us, greeting Deputy Captain Li and Master Lian. I thought to myself: Good morning, comrades, there were no major accidents at any of the well sites last night, and your shift handover will be smooth.

    夜访攀枝花铁矿探区
    新华社记者　程在华
    3月上旬的一个晚上，我随四川地质局攀枝花队副队长李道鉴和连贞同师傅到山上的探区去作夜间巡视。
    春天的攀枝花的夜空非常清彻。蓝天上嵌满灿烂的星星。夜很静，高大的攀枝花树上的花朵拍拍地掉落在大地上。
    一兜峰顶，沁人的凉风就扑面吹来。凭着钻机有规律的运转声和井架上的点点灯火，我们辨识到一些井场的位置，还可以眺望到金沙江对岸云南省境内一个勘探队工地的灯光。那里的工人也正在度着一个不眠之夜——为攀枝花探区寻找炼钢用的煤。
    井场上都还生着火盆，这同亚热带山下的燥热成一对照。我们一个一个井场看下去。到了五○八井场，连师傅看了看柴油机运转情况，摸摸循环水的温度，然后指示工人把水兑凉些。他又走到钻架旁，摸着给进把，侧耳听听钻进的声音。这位五十一岁的老工人立刻觉得有些不对头。他建议起钻。一看，原来钻头的合金钢已经磨光了。工人们换了钻头再钻。
    我们又巡视到五○二井场，五○一井场……。有的运转情况正常，有的也还有些小毛病。在午夜以后的电灯光下面，我看见：每当连师傅和工人们一道解决了什么困难的时候，大家脸上露出多么喜悦的神色。李副队长告诉我：这个队的新工人的比重很大，老师傅们经常在工作易于松懈的夜间来检查检查，可以避免重大事故。
    这一夜，我们走完了攀枝花铁矿探区的主要工段。当我们下山的时候，东方已露曙色。山谷回响着各井场匀称的柴油机和钻机的声音。上早班的钻井工人从我们对面走来，向李副队长和连师傅打招呼。我心里想：早安啊，同志，各井场昨夜并无大事故，你们的接班会是顺利的。
