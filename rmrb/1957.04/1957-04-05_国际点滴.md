	The Ancient Hungarian Crown
	According to the British "Daily Express," at the beginning of the Hungarian October incident last year, the US authorities transported the ancient Hungarian crown to West Germany, preparing to find a way to transport it into Hungary after the counter-revolutionaries restored power. The ancient Hungarian crown is a famous antique. At the end of World War II, the United States received this historical relic from Nazi Germany, transported it to the United States, and has refused to return it to the Hungarian people.

	West Germany's "Halbstarke Dance" Craze
	On the evening of March 30, West German police dispersed a "Halbstarke" dance party held in a dance hall in West Berlin and arrested thirty people. Prior to this, two thousand five hundred crazed dance fans messed up the seats and began dancing wildly in the dance hall. The police quickly drove the dancers out of the dance hall, but the dance fans threw stones at the walls and windows to protest the dispersal of the dance party.

    古匈牙利的王冕
    据英国“每日快报”讯，去年匈牙利十月事件发生之初，美国当局把古匈牙利的王冕运到西德，准备于反革命复辟后，设法运入匈牙利。古匈牙利王冕是著名的古物。第二次世界大战结束时，美国从纳粹德国手中接收了这项历史古物，运往美国，一直拒绝把它交还给匈牙利人民。
    西德的“阿飞舞”狂
    西德警察于3月30日晚在西柏林驱散了在一家舞厅举行的“阿飞”舞会，并且逮捕了三十个人。在这之前，两千五百个如痴如狂的舞迷把坐位搞得乱七八糟，开始在舞池里狂跳起来。警察迅速地把跳舞的人都轰出舞厅，可是舞迷们用石头打墙壁和窗户，对驱散这个舞会表示抗议。
