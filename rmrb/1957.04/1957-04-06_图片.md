    The "May 1st" Agricultural Cooperative in Chao'an County, Guangdong Province, is a cooperative with 817 households, but last year it had 17 cadres who were relieved from production and 82 people receiving fixed work subsidies. In order to strive for a bumper harvest and reduce the burden on cooperative members, the cooperative's leadership structure was streamlined before the spring plowing this year, leaving only six cadres relieved from production and eight people receiving fixed work subsidies. The cooperative cadres also tried their best to participate in production. This shows cooperative director Xie Yueyi (first person on the left) and deputy director Chen Jiaozhou (second person on the left) leveling the ridges with cooperative members to expand the cultivated land area.

    广东省潮安县“五一”农业社，是个八百一十七户的社，但去年就有脱产干部十七人，固定补工八十二人。为了争取大丰收，并减轻社员的负担，今年在春耕前精简了社的领导机构，只留脱产干部六人，固定补工八人，社干部并尽量抽身参加生产。这是社主任谢岳意（左第一人）、副主任陈加洲（左第二人）和社员一起平地畦扩大耕地面积。　新华社记者　蔡忠植摄
