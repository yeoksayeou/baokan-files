Title: Wood Products Should Not Be Restricted from Leaving the Province

    It is reported by comrades from the Hunan Provincial Handicraft Administration Bureau that since the market supply of timber became tight in the fourth quarter of last year, the Hunan Provincial Forestry Industry Department has imposed strict restrictions on the export of wood products. The original sales channels of many wood product production cooperatives have been disrupted. In Qiyang, Dong'an, Lingling and other counties alone, twelve wood product production cooperatives have stockpiled 12,910 pieces of various wood products, with a total value of more than 35,600 yuan. Two wood product production cooperatives in Dong'an County originally accepted orders from the Nanning Housing Management Office of the Liuzhou Railway Bureau and produced 1,800 wooden beds and office desks. The payment for the goods has been settled and the desks have been transported to Dong'an Station, but the local Forestry Industry Department does not allow them to be shipped. Now this batch of wood products has been eroded by sun and rain.
    As a timber-producing area, it may be necessary to formulate timber management measures to prevent indiscriminate logging and protect resources. However, the raw materials for handicraft production cooperatives do not necessarily have to be timber. For example, furniture such as tables, chairs, basins, and buckets can mostly be made from the scraps of building materials. If these scraps are not utilized by the handicraft production cooperatives, they will be burned as firewood. Moreover, the wood product production in various counties of Hunan has always been marketed to other provinces. For example, the products of the Xinqiaohe Wood Product Production Cooperative in Yiyang County have always been sold in Hubei and other places. According to statistics from the second and third quarters of 1956, the external sales volume accounted for 70%; many product specifications are also adapted to the usage habits of other places. When the timber supply is tight, the forestry industry department should allocate as much usable scrap material as possible to the wood product production cooperatives and encourage the wood product cooperatives to make full use of it; instead of restricting the sales channels of the wood product production cooperatives at the same time as restricting indiscriminate logging, creating an even more tense situation.
    The resource conditions of each province are different. Some provinces produce coal, some provinces produce iron, some provinces produce timber, and some provinces produce cotton. Only by exchanging what one has for what one needs can we meet the needs of production and construction and the people's lives in various provinces. If the places of origin of various materials restrict exports like the Hunan Provincial Forestry Industry Department treats wood products, I am afraid that Hunan's production and construction and the people's lives will be greatly affected.

### 不该限制木器出境

    不该限制木器出境
  　胡道源
    据湖南省手工业管理局的同志谈：自从去年第四季度市场上木材供应紧张以后，湖南省森林工业部门对木器出境作了严格的限制。许多木器生产合作社的原有销路被打断了。仅祁阳、东安、零陵等县十二个木器生产合作社，就积压了各种木器一万二千九百一十件，总值达三万五千六百多元。东安县两个木器生产合作社原来接受了柳州铁路局南宁房屋管理厅的订货，制出的一千八百件木床、办公桌，货款已经交清，桌子也运到东安车站，当地森林工业部门却不准启运。现在这批木器已经遭到日晒夜露的浸蚀。
    作为一个木材产区，为了防止滥伐木材，破坏资源，制定一个木材管理办法也许是必要的。但是，手工业生产合作社的原料，不一定要成材，如桌椅盆桶等家具，大都可以用建筑部门的边材碎料制造。这些边材碎料，手工业生产合作社不利用，也会当作薪柴烧掉。而且湖南各县的木器生产一向是以外省为市场的，如益阳县新桥河木器生产合作社的产品，历来行销湖北等地，据1956年二、三季度统计，外销量占70％；许多产品规格，也都是适应外地的使用习惯。在木材供应紧张的时候，森林工业部门应当尽量把可以利用的边材碎料拨给木器生产合作社，鼓励木器社充分利用；而不应当在限制滥伐木材的同时，对木器生产合作社的产品销路也横加限制，制造更加紧张的局面。
    各省资源情况不同，有的省产煤，有的省产铁，有的省产木材，有的省产棉花。只有互通有无，才能满足各省生产建设和人民生活的需要。如果各种物资的产地，都像湖南省森林工业部门对待木器那样限制出境，恐怕湖南的生产建设和人民生活将会受到重大的影响。
