Xinhua News Agency, April 4th—The Executive Committee meeting of the International Organization of Journalists (IOJ) in Beijing continued its discussions on the morning of April 4th.

Today is the 12th anniversary of Hungary's liberation. At the beginning of the meeting, the Executive Chairman, Mr. Klamenov (Soviet Union), proposed to congratulate the Hungarian delegation, and everyone stood up and applauded.

Jan Halpern, acting editor-in-chief of the Polish newspaper "Life of Warsaw," spoke. He said that Polish journalists have established extensive contacts with journalists from various countries. Halpern hoped that the IOJ would take multifaceted actions to enable journalists worldwide to develop friendly cooperation and connections. He also said that he hopes to conduct a survey on the obstacles encountered in news reporting worldwide and propose solutions.

Porubszky György, editor-in-chief of the "Hungarian National Newspaper," spoke, saying that life in Hungary is now gradually returning to normal. He pointed out that when the counter-revolutionary riots occurred in Hungary last year, some Hungarian journalists should also be held responsible for the counter-revolutionary riots. Some of them even became ideological steeds for the counter-revolutionaries; and at that time, "journalists" who were former war criminals, fascists, and traitors emerged, seizing various news tools to serve the counter-revolutionary cause.

He severely criticized some journalists in Western countries for not only deliberately distorting the facts and nature of the events in Hungary's tragic process but also abandoning the recognized ethical principles of journalists and even directly interfering, inciting people to use violence to attack Hungary's legitimate people's democratic regime. Furthermore, "Radio Free Europe," "Voice of America," and other radio stations directly issued instructions to armed bandits and incited the masses to disrupt order. He said that these clearly illustrate how significant the responsibility of journalists is. When they conduct activities for reactionary imperialist forces, it can cause tragic consequences and incite hatred and hostility internationally.

Hyun Pil-hoon, editor-in-chief of the Korean "Rodong Sinmun," said that as long as our journalists can stand with the people fighting for peace and establish fair public opinion, they will surely be able to further promote the cause of world peace. He said that journalists should conduct mutual visits, contact, conversations, and exchange information. He criticized the U.S. imperialism and the South Korean authorities for setting up obstacles between the North and South of Korea, preventing journalists from North and South Korea from contacting each other. He also exposed the South Korean government's suppression of freedom of speech and publication.

Jin Zhonghua, vice chairman of the All-China Journalists Association and director of the Shanghai "Xinwen Ribao," spoke. He used the facts of the friendship and connections established between China and journalists from various countries to illustrate that no artificial barriers can permanently prevent exchanges and contacts between journalists from various countries.

Jin Zhonghua said that there is much work to be done to achieve international cooperation among journalists. The IOJ should strengthen cooperation and contact with some national journalist organizations and regional international journalist organizations that do not belong to the IOJ or the International Federation of Journalists.

Jin Zhonghua said that in the Asia, Africa, and Latin America regions, the news industries of many countries have been rapidly established and developed, and they demand mutual cooperation and support. They hope that the people's anti-colonial struggles and the construction of new countries can be truly and objectively reflected in news reports, and this desire should be respected.

Daniel Kraminov, Vice President of the IOJ and Editorial Board Member of the Soviet "Pravda," said that he recently talked with Australian friends in the press in Australia about his impressions of the meeting in Helsinki. They believed that the meeting was beneficial to all journalists. They regretted that their newspaper owners' union held a malicious attitude towards the meeting. He said that this shows that we cannot find a common language with some journalists not because these people do not sympathize with our wishes, but because they are in a very restricted position.

Kraminov said that the representatives of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who attended the Helsinki meeting last year brought us closer to friends in the press in these countries. The interests of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are consistent with our political interests. Therefore, we can and should seek a common language with journalists from these countries.

Kraminov said that friendly exchanges among journalists from various countries should be widely developed. He said that the IOJ has done a lot of work in expanding contacts between journalists from various countries, but this is only the starting point, and he hopes that the work in this area can be strengthened in the future. He also talked about organizing in-depth interviews with individual journalists in addition to exchanging delegations.

Vojtěch Dolejší, Chairman of the Czechoslovak Journalists Association and Editor-in-Chief of the "Creation" magazine, spoke. He said that the number of people engaged in journalism in the Czechoslovak Republic has now reached three times that of pre-war. He expressed the good wishes of Czechoslovak journalists to exchange with journalists from all over the world. He said that only close exchanges and contacts between journalists from various countries can unite and cooperate, thereby contributing to the progress of mankind.

Nguyen Thanh Le, General Secretary of the Vietnam Journalists Association and Editorial Board Member of the "Nhan Dan" newspaper, spoke about the cooperation between journalists from Asian and African countries. He said that Asian and African countries should cooperate in various ways and forms, such as exchanging news稿件, information, pictures, and newspapers, exchanging journalists and mutual visits by journalists from various countries, and holding Asian-African journalists conferences. He said that Vietnamese journalists will do everything possible to work for the cooperation of journalists from various countries and will work to promote cooperation between journalists in North and South Vietnam.

Ahmed Kassem Gouda, a guest invited to the meeting, editor-in-chief of the Egyptian "Al-Gomhuria" and former chairman of the Egyptian Journalists Association, spoke at the meeting. He said that the Egyptian Journalists Association is not a member of the IOJ and has not participated in other international groups. However, this does not affect our respect for the IOJ. He said that Egyptian journalists agree that journalists from various countries can conduct mutual visits, and Egypt's door is open to journalists from various countries.

He said that in the just struggle of the Egyptian people against the aggressors, the progressive public opinion and news colleagues of the world have given the Egyptian people deep sympathy, care, and support. He thanked the valuable efforts made by journalists from various countries.

At the same time, he pointed out that there is another group of journalists who have not transcended the interests of imperialism and capitalists and have carried out reports that distorted the truth when the Egyptian people were in crisis. He condemned the recent reports in the U.S. "New York Times" and "Newsweek" about their reporters' visits to President Nasser. He said that these reports completely violated the ethics of news reporting.

He suggested that the IOJ issue an appeal to journalists all over the world, calling on journalists all over the world to adhere to the sacred ethics of their profession and not to stain public opinion for the enticement of any ruling group.

The participants listened to Ahmed Kassem Gouda's speech with great interest. After his speech, the audience applauded warmly. Executive Chairman Klamenov said that we, journalists from various countries united within the IOJ, believe that we will surely receive the help and support of Egyptian friends in the press in our work in the future. We very much agree with the appeal made by Egyptian colleagues to colleagues all over the world.

    广泛发展各国新闻工作者的友好往来
    国际新闻工作者协会执委会会议昨日上午继续进行讨论
    据新华社4日讯　国际新闻工作者协会执行委员会北京会议在4日上午继续进行讨论。
    今天是匈牙利解放十二周年纪念日，会议开始的时候，执行主席克拉米诺夫（苏联）提议向匈牙利代表团表示祝贺，全体起立鼓掌。
    波兰“华沙生活报”代理总编辑扬·哈尔佩恩发言。他说，波兰新闻工作者同各国新闻工作者已经建立了广泛的联系。哈尔佩恩希望国际新闻工作者协会采取多方面的行动使全世界新闻工作者发展友好合作和联系。他还说，希望在世界范围内进行关于新闻报道中所遇到的障碍的调查，并提出解决的办法。
    “匈牙利民族报”总编辑波腊吉·捷尔吉发言，他谈到目前匈牙利的生活已日趋正常。他指出，去年匈牙利发生反革命暴乱事件时，匈牙利的一部分新闻工作者对反革命暴乱事件也应负有责任，他们中有些人还成了反革命分子的思想上的战马；而当时并出现了由过去的战犯、法西斯分子和叛徒变成的“记者”，他们夺取了各种新闻工具，用来为反革命的目的服务。
    他严厉指责了西方国家的某些记者在匈牙利事件的悲惨过程中，不仅故意歪曲事实和事件性质，并且抛弃公认的记者道德原则，甚至直接进行干涉，煽动人们以暴力进攻匈牙利合法的人民民主政权。而“自由欧洲”、“美国之音”和其他一些电台，更直接向武装匪徒发指示和煽动群众扰乱秩序。他说，这些都清楚地说明，新闻工作者的责任是如何重大，当他们为反动的帝国主义势力进行活动时，就可能造成悲惨的后果，以及在国际间挑起仇恨和敌意。
    朝鲜“劳动新闻”总编辑玄弼勋发言说，只要我们记者能够同为和平而斗争的人民一道，建立公正的舆论，就必定能够更加促进世界和平事业。他说，记者之间应互相进行访问、接触、交谈和交换资料。他指责了美帝国主义和南朝鲜当局在朝鲜南北部之间设立了障碍，使南北朝鲜的记者不能相互接触。他还揭露了南朝鲜政府镇压言论出版事业的情况。
    中华全国新闻工作者协会副会长、上海“新闻日报”社长金仲华发言。他用中国同各国新闻工作者所建立的友谊和联系的事实说明，任何人为的障壁，都不能长久阻隔各国新闻记者之间的往来接触。
    金仲华说，为了实现记者的国际合作，要作的工作是很多的。国际新闻工作者协会应该同不属于国际新闻工作者协会或国际新闻工作者联合会的一些全国性的记者组织和地区性的国际记者组织加强合作和联系。
    金仲华说，在亚、非和拉丁美洲地区，许多国家自己的新闻事业迅速举办和发展起来了，它们要求彼此合作，互相支援。它们希望人民的反殖民主义斗争和建设新国家的情况，能在新闻报道中得到真实客观的反映，这种愿望应当得到尊重。
    国际新闻工作者协会副主席、苏联“真理报”编委达尼埃尔·克拉米诺夫发言说，最近他在澳大利亚同澳大利亚新闻界朋友谈起了对赫尔辛基会见的印象，他们认为这次会见对所有新闻工作者都是有益的，他们遗憾的是他们的报业主联合会对这次会见抱有恶意态度。他说，这说明，我们同某些新闻工作者找不到共同的语言，并不是因为这些人不同情我们的愿望，而是因为他们处于某种十分受人约制的地位。
    克拉米诺夫说，去年亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的代表出席了赫尔辛基会见会，这使我们同这些国家的新闻界朋友更接近了。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的利益和我们的政治利益是一致的，因此，我们能够，也应该同这些国家的新闻工作者寻求共同的语言。
    克拉米诺夫说，应当广泛发展各国新闻工作者的友好往来。他说，国际新闻工作者协会在扩大各国记者之间的联系工作已作了不少工作，但这仅仅是起点，希望今后这方面的工作能够加强。他还谈到除了交换代表团之外，还可以组织个别记者的深入采访。
    捷克斯洛伐克新闻工作者协会主席、“创造”杂志总编辑伏依特赫·多列依希发言。他说，目前在捷克斯洛伐克共和国从事新闻工作的人数已达到战前的三倍。他表达了捷克斯洛伐克新闻工作者愿意同世界各国新闻工作者往来的良好愿望。他说，各国新闻工作者之间只有进行密切的往来和联系才能团结合作，从而对人类进步事业作出贡献。
    越南新闻工作者协会总书记、“人民报”编委阮成黎发言时谈到亚非各国新闻工作者之间的合作问题。他说，亚非各国应该运用各种办法和形式进行合作，例如交换新闻稿件、资料、图片、报纸，交换记者和各国新闻工作者相互访问，以及举行亚非国家新闻工作者会议等等。他说，越南新闻工作者将要尽一切力量来为各国新闻工作者的合作而努力，并且要为促进北越和南越之间的新闻工作者之间的合作而努力。
    应邀参加会议的来宾、埃及“共和国报”总编辑、埃及新闻工作者协会前任主席艾哈迈德·卡塞姆·古达在会上发言。他说，埃及新闻工作者协会并不是国际新闻工作者协会的成员，也没有参加其他的国际团体。但是，这并不影响我们对国际新闻工作者协会的尊重。他说，埃及的新闻工作者们赞同各国新闻记者能相互进行访问，埃及的大门是向各国记者敞开着的。
    他说，在埃及人民抗击侵略者的正义斗争中，世界的进步舆论和新闻同业们给了埃及人民以深切的同情、关怀和支持，他感谢各国新闻工作者所作的这种可贵的努力。
    他同时指出，也有另外一部分新闻工作者，他们没有超越出帝国主义和资本家的利益，在埃及人民危急的时候，进行了歪曲事实真相的报道。他谴责了最近美国“纽约时报”和“新闻周刊”关于他们的记者访问纳赛尔总统之后的报道。他说，这些报道完全违背了新闻报道的道德。
    他建议国际新闻工作者协会向全世界的新闻工作者发出呼吁，号召全世界新闻工作者坚持他们职业的神圣道德，不为任何统治集团的利诱而沾污舆论。
    与会的人以极大的兴趣听取了艾哈迈德·卡塞姆·古达的发言。在他发言后，全场热烈鼓掌。执行主席克拉米诺夫说，我们团结在国际新闻工作者协会以内的各国新闻工作者相信，今后一定会得到埃及新闻界朋友对我们工作的帮助和支持，我们非常同意埃及同业向全世界同业提出的呼吁。
