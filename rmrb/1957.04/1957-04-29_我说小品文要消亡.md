    I Say Prose Poems are Dying Out
    Fan Zhou
    Comrade Huichun has raised the new crisis of prose poems, and some people disagree; I say that the crisis not only exists, but is very large, and will inevitably lead to the demise of prose poems in the end. The reason is very simple, the problems raised by Comrade Huichun are, in my opinion, fundamentally unsolvable.
    The reason why I advocate that prose poems should not continue to exist is not because I am a "stabbed person" and have any personal grudges against prose poems, but simply to speak out for others. I once saw a good comrade who, because of an occasional mistake, was greatly satirized in a prose poem in a publication, and as a result, this comrade became depressed ever since. May I ask, what good is such a prose poem? Is there any need for it to continue to exist? If it cannot cure the disease but adds to the pain, anyone will understand that this is contrary to the purpose of criticism.
    Criticism is necessary, but satire is not equal to criticism. Criticism must also pay attention to methods and ways, and it is not necessary to "stab" the other party to the ground. But some people insist that prose poems are meant to satirize, and the more clever and sharp the satire, the better; as a result, meanness replaces sharpness, rudeness replaces reasoning, one-sidedness replaces comprehensiveness, and even sometimes it is fabrication of facts, close to personal attacks. People are "done in" miserably! The analogy of "incompetent doctors killing people" is very inappropriate, but the bad effects are the same.
    Perhaps some people will say that prose poems are a way to resolve contradictions among the people and cannot be abolished. I doubt whether this method can really play a good role and solve any practical problems. In fact, there are many ways to resolve contradictions among the people, such as organizational education, mutual assistance, patient persuasion, etc., which will make people easier to accept, have fewer problems, and achieve greater results. If a person makes a mistake and receives not well-intentioned criticism, help, care, and encouragement, but satire and blows, who can stand it? This will not only fail to resolve contradictions among the people, but will complicate and deepen them.
    Those who insist that prose poems are indispensable also forget what era we are in: the enemy still exists, and they are trying every means to sabotage us. For them, we must not only stab, but also stab accurately and ruthlessly. If prose poems do not regard this aspect as their own battlefield, but instead point their spearhead at the people, they should not be labeled as losing their stand, but at least they have a weak sense of the enemy's situation. As Comrade Huichun said, this kind of prose poem "is a product of an undemocratic era." Lu Xun's essays were to deal with the enemies of the people, and he "never ridiculed or attacked the revolutionary people and the revolutionary party" (as Chairman Mao said). Therefore, our current prose poems rarely fight against the enemy, but mostly satirize our own people, which I fear is not a temporary mistake, but a fundamental error in direction.
    I say that prose poems are dying out, and there are also inherent and insurmountable contradictions, the most important of which is: from the perspective of the authors of prose poems, the low level is a fact; even experts cannot guarantee that they will not make mistakes. Extreme one-sidedness and exaggerated inaccuracy are inevitable, and it is not accidental that comrades are accidentally injured or seriously injured. Therefore, the existence of prose poems leads to disharmony and many malpractices; without them, it is more conducive to unity and does not hurt feelings. What's wrong with that?
    In this way, from crisis to demise, this is the inevitable result of the development of prose poems themselves, and it cannot be forced. Therefore, Comrade Huichun's hope that writing prose poems should be done quickly, well, and economically is a bit like dreaming of picking up gold.

### 我说小品文要消亡

    我说小品文要消亡
    范舟
    回春同志提出了小品文的新危机，有人不同意；我说，危机不仅有，而且很大，发展到最后就必然是小品文的消亡。原因很简单，回春同志提出的那些问题，在我看来是根本无法解决的。
    我之所以主张小品文不该继续存在，并非因我是“被刺伤者”，对小品文有什么私仇宿怨，只是为他人鸣不平而已。我曾见过一位好同志，因偶犯错误，被人写小品文在刊物上大大讽刺了一通，结果，这位同志反而从此消沉了。试问，这样的小品文有什么好处？有什么必要继续存在？不能药到病除，反而添加病苦，谁也会清楚这是有违于批评的目的的。
    批评是要的，但讽刺并不等于批评。批评也得讲求方式方法，不必非把对方“刺”倒不可。但偏偏却有人说，小品文就是要讽刺，并且讽刺得愈巧妙、愈尖锐愈好；于是，刻薄代替了尖锐，粗暴代替了说理，片面代替了全面，甚而有时是捏造事实，近于人身攻击。把人“整”得可苦啦！“庸医杀人”的譬喻虽很不恰当，但效果很坏则同。
    也许有人会说，小品文是解决人民内部矛盾的一个办法，不能取消。我怀疑这办法真能起什么好作用，解决什么实际问题。其实，解决人民内部矛盾的办法多得很，比如组织教育，相互帮助，耐心说服等，这样会使人易于接受，少出毛病，成效更大。如果一个人有了错误，受到的不是善意批评、帮助、关怀和鼓励，而是讽刺、打击，谁受得了？这样不但不能解决人民内部矛盾，反而使之复杂、深化。
    主张小品文非要不可的人还忘记了我们所处的是什么时代：敌人还存在，并且千方百计的要破坏我们，对于他们，我们才不仅要刺，而且要刺得准，刺得狠。小品文不把这方面当成是自己的战场，反而矛头指向人民内部，不要扣上失掉立场的帽子，至少也是敌情观念不强吧。正如回春同志所说，这类小品文“是不民主的时代的产物”，鲁迅的杂文就是对付人民的敌人的，他就“不曾嘲笑和攻击革命人民和革命政党”（毛主席语）。因此，我们现在的小品文很少对敌作战，多是对人民自己的讽刺，恐非一时之误，而是根本方向的错误。
    我说小品文要消亡，还有它内在不可克服的矛盾，其中最重要的一点是：从小品文的作者看，水平不高是事实；即使是专家，也不能保险不出差错。极端片面，夸张失实固所不免，误伤、重伤自己同志的事亦非偶然，因此，有了小品文，有伤和气，流弊甚多；没有，反倒有利团结，不伤感情。这有什么不好呢？
    这样说来，从危机到消亡，这是小品文本身发展的必然结果，是勉强不了的。所以，回春同志希望写小品文也要做到又快、又好、又省，就未免有点像梦拾黄金了。
