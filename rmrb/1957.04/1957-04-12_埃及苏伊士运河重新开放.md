    Egypt's Suez Canal Reopens

    After more than three months of active efforts by the Egyptian government and people, the clearing of the Suez Canal has been fully completed, and it officially resumed navigation on April 10. The full resumption of navigation of the Suez Canal under the management of the Egyptian government is a new and important victory for the Egyptian people in their struggle to safeguard national sovereignty. It has made outstanding contributions to connecting transportation between Europe, Asia, and Africa, facilitating exchanges between peoples of all countries, and developing international trade.

    The Suez Canal belongs to Egypt. It is an important transportation waterway excavated by the Egyptian working people on Egyptian land, and its sovereignty belongs to Egypt. However, for nearly ninety years in the past, Western colonialist countries such as Britain and France have been occupying this canal as a blood vessel for their plunder of the Egyptian people and the people of Asian and African countries. On July 26 last year, the independent Egyptian government, in order to safeguard national sovereignty, announced the recovery from the British and French colonialists of the so-called International Suez Canal Company, which controlled the Suez Canal. During the first four months of Egypt's takeover of the Suez Canal Company, navigation on the Suez Canal was managed in an orderly manner. The number of ships from various countries passing through the canal every day not only did not decrease but actually increased compared to before Egypt took over. However, this just action by Egypt to protect its national sovereignty was met with frantic resistance from Western colonialists such as the United States, Britain, and France. Under the planning of the United States, Western colonialists created conspiracies and tricks such as so-called "international control," an "association of user nations," and forcing foreign pilots to resign, attempting to seize the Suez Canal back from the Egyptian people. However, these shameless attempts of theirs have failed one after another.

    The interruption of Suez Canal navigation was caused by the war of aggression against Egypt launched by Britain and France in collusion with Israel after these conspiracies and tricks of the Western colonialists failed. In the war of aggression against Egypt, the British, French, and Israeli aggressors indiscriminately bombed the Suez Canal area and major cities and transportation arteries in Egypt. They wanted to subdue the Egyptian people with bloody massacres and achieve their despicable goal of regaining control of the Suez Canal. Therefore, the British, French, and Israeli aggressors should be fully responsible for all the damage suffered by many countries in the world due to the canal being cut off.

    The British and French aggressors also reaped what they sowed and suffered very serious losses. According to estimates by the American magazine "Newsweek," the direct military expenditure of Britain and France in the war of aggression against Egypt totaled 200 million US dollars; and due to the interruption of Suez Canal navigation, the cost for Britain and France to purchase oil from the United States and for oil tankers to detour around southern Africa was as high as 1.1 billion US dollars. Therefore, after the failure of the British and French in the war of aggression against Egypt, they had to immediately borrow heavily from abroad, which further aggravated their already stretched financial situation. In the case of Britain, economically, it borrowed 1.8 billion US dollars from abroad and even begged the United States to waive interest payments. Politically, the Eden government was forced to step down, further weakening Britain's international position. In contrast, the United States made a fortune from the failure of the British and French in the war of aggression against Egypt and the interruption of the Suez Canal. The United States not only monopolized the oil supply to Britain, France, and Western European countries at high prices, earning huge amounts of US dollars, but also took advantage of the weakening of British and French forces in the Middle East to step into the Middle East in large strides, replacing Britain and France. This is what the United States calls "filling the vacuum left by Britain and France."

    After the British and French invading troops were forced to withdraw from Port Said, the Egyptian government and people immediately began work to remove obstacles in the canal in order to restore navigation on the Suez Canal as soon as possible, and gradually resumed navigation for ships of various tonnages during the clearing process. When the Suez Canal was nearing full navigation, the Egyptian government submitted a memorandum to the governments of various countries, notifying them of the plan to manage the canal after the reopening of the Suez Canal. Although the content of the Egyptian memorandum has not been officially announced, according to various sources, this memorandum, while upholding the principle of safeguarding Egypt's sovereignty over the Suez Canal, guarantees the safe and non-discriminatory passage of ships from all countries through the Suez Canal in accordance with the terms and spirit of the 1888 Constantinople Convention, and allocates a certain amount from the collected tolls for the development of the canal. United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld also said at a press conference on April 4 that Egypt's proposals were similar to his own proposals and did not conflict with the principles adopted by the United Nations Security Council. It can be seen that Egypt's plan to manage the canal is reasonable and is the greatest effort made by Egypt to ensure navigation on the Suez Canal.

    However, disregarding Egypt's sovereign interests in the Suez Canal, the United States took the lead in constantly putting pressure on Egypt, still trying to deprive Egypt of its sovereignty over the Suez Canal, even as the Egyptian government and people were about to clear the canal. The United States initially wanted to seize half of the tolls collected by Egypt, and now it is even quibbling with Egypt on the pretext that the Egyptian memorandum does not mention the so-called six principles "adopted" by the United Nations Security Council. According to US Secretary of State Dulles at a press conference on April 2, the so-called "six principles" are to establish the rights of canal users and "establish an organization of user nations" to jointly decide on the collection of canal tolls with the Egyptian government. Dulles explained that the conditions hoped for by the United States are the notorious so-called "Eighteen-Nation Proposal" conveyed to Egypt by Menzies. As everyone knows, this so-called "Eighteen-Nation Proposal" was proposed during the London Conference before the British and French war of aggression against Egypt. It was intended to completely deprive Egypt of its sovereignty over the Suez Canal and was resolutely rejected by the Egyptian government at the time.

    In order to achieve its attempt to seize the Suez Canal, the United States is colluding with Britain, France, and even Israel, exerting pressure from all sides, trying to force Egypt to abandon its sovereignty over the Suez Canal. The United States has repeatedly called on American ships not to use the Suez Canal. At the Bermuda Conference, the United States and Britain planned to build new oil pipelines in Iraq and Turkey and to build large oil tankers to detour around southern Africa in order to resist the Suez Canal. The United States is also instigating and using Israel to threaten Egypt and Arab countries with war over the Gaza Strip issue and the navigation issue in the Gulf of Aqaba. And US President's special envoy Richards is active in the Middle East, trying to divide the unity between Arab countries in order to isolate Egypt and other Arab countries that maintain their independence. The United States' open participation in the Baghdad Pact Military Committee and the supply of large quantities of military weapons to the Baghdad Pact countries and Israel is a military threat to independent Arab countries.

    However, this rampant attempt by the United States is doomed to failure. The Egyptian and Arab peoples, who have already defeated the British, French, and Israeli aggressors, will continue to fight to defend the independence and sovereignty of their motherland. Egyptian President Nasser recently told American reporters that the Suez Canal is Egyptian land and that imperialist countries "cannot accuse Egypt of being unyielding because it defends its legitimate rights. They can no longer expect us to obey their wishes and submit to their demands." This fully demonstrates the firm determination of the Egyptian people to defend their sovereignty. The just struggle of the Egyptian and Arab peoples will surely continue to receive the sympathy and support of all righteous people in the world!

### 埃及苏伊士运河重新开放

    埃及苏伊士运河重新开放
    经过埃及政府和人民三个多月的积极努力，苏伊士运河的清理工作已经全部完成，从4月10日起正式恢复通航了。苏伊士运河在埃及政府管理之下全部恢复通航，是埃及人民维护国家主权斗争中的一个新的重要胜利，它对沟通欧亚非三洲交通、便利各国人民往来、发展国际贸易作出了出色的贡献。
    苏伊士运河属于埃及所有，它是由埃及劳动人民在埃及土地上开凿出来的一条重要交通水道，它的主权属于埃及。可是，在过去将近九十年期间，英法等西方殖民主义国家一直霸占着这条运河，作为它们掠夺埃及人民和亚非国家人民的输血管。去年7月26日，独立的埃及政府为维护国家的主权，宣布从英法殖民者手里收回控制着苏伊士运河的所谓国际苏伊士运河公司。在埃及接管苏伊士运河公司的最初四个月期间，苏伊士运河的航行一直被管理得有条不紊，每天通过运河的各国船只不仅没有减少，反而比埃及接收以前有了增加。但是，埃及这一保护国家主权的正义行动，却遭到了美英法等西方殖民主义者的疯狂反抗。在美国的策划下，西方殖民主义者制造出所谓“国际管制”、“使用国协会”和强迫外籍领航员离职等阴谋诡计，企图从埃及人民手里重新夺取苏伊士运河。但是，它们的这些无耻企图都一个接着一个地破产了。
    苏伊士运河航运的中断，就是在西方殖民主义者这些阴谋诡计失败之后，英法勾结以色列发动对埃及的侵略战争所造成的。英法和以色列侵略者在侵略埃及的战争中，对苏伊士运河区和埃及的各大城市、交通要道滥施轰炸，它们想用血腥的屠杀来慑服埃及人民，达到它们重新控制苏伊士运河的卑鄙目的。因此，世界许多国家由于运河被切断而遭受到的一切损害，应由英法和以色列侵略者完全负责。
    英法侵略者也自食其果，遭受到十分严重的损失。据美国“新闻周刊”估计，英法在侵略埃及战争中耗费的直接军费共达两亿美元；而由于苏伊士运河航运中断，英法两国向美国购买石油和油轮绕道南非洲的费用更达十一亿美元之巨。因此，英法在侵略埃及战争失败之后，不得不立即大借外债，使本来捉襟见肘的财政状况更趋恶化。以英国来说，在经济上，向外举债十八亿美元，还向美国乞求免付利息。在政治上，艾登政府被迫倒台，使英国的国际地位更为削弱。与此相反，美国却在英法侵略埃及战争失败和苏伊士运河中断里大发横财，美国不仅以高价垄断了英法和西欧各国的石油供应，赚取了巨额美元；而且趁英法在中近东地区势力的削弱，大踏步侵入中近东地区，取英法而代之。这就是美国所谓的“填补英法留下的真空”。
    英法侵略军队被迫撤出塞得港以后，埃及政府和人民为使苏伊士运河早日恢复通航，立即开始了清除运河障碍物的工作，并在清理过程中逐步恢复对各种不同吨位船只的航行。在苏伊士运河接近全部通航的时候，埃及政府向各国政府提出了备忘录，通知苏伊士运河重新开放后管理运河的计划。埃及备忘录的内容虽然还没有正式公布，但是据各方面透露，这个备忘录在维护埃及对苏伊士运河主权的原则下，根据1888年君士坦丁堡公约的条款和精神，保证各国的船只安全和不加歧视地通过苏伊士运河，并在所征收的通行费中拨出一定的数目作为发展运河之用。联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德4月4日在记者招待会上也曾说，埃及的建议是同他自己的建议差不多的，并且同联合国安全理事会所通过的原则没有冲突。可见埃及管理运河的计划是合情合理的，是埃及保障苏伊士运河航运所作的最大努力。
    但是，美国却不顾埃及对苏伊士运河的主权利益，在埃及政府和人民快要疏通运河的时候，带头向埃及不断施加压力，仍然想剥夺埃及对苏伊士运河的主权。美国最初想夺取埃及征收的一半通行费，而现在更借口埃及的备忘录中没有提所谓联合国安全理事会“通过”的六项原则，硬同埃及进行纠缠。按照美国国务卿杜勒斯4月2日在记者招待会上的说法，所谓“六项原则”就是要确立运河使用国的权利，“建立一个使用国的组织”，由它同埃及政府共同决定征收运河通行费。杜勒斯解释说，美国心目中希望的条件，就是由孟席斯转达给埃及的臭名昭著的所谓“十八国建议”。大家知道，这个所谓“十八国建议”，还是在英法侵略埃及战争以前的伦敦会议期间提出的，它就是要完全剥夺埃及的苏伊士运河主权，当时已经被埃及政府坚决拒绝了。
    美国为了达到它夺取苏伊士运河的企图，正同英法甚至以色列勾结起来，从各方面施加压力，想迫使埃及放弃对苏伊士运河的主权。美国已一再号召美国船只不要走苏伊士运河。在百慕大会议上，美英两国策划在伊拉克和土耳其修筑新油管，并建造大型油船绕道南非洲，以抵制苏伊士运河。美国还策动和利用以色列在加沙地区问题上和亚喀巴湾航行问题上向埃及和阿拉伯国家进行战争威胁。而美国总统特使理查兹正在中东活动，力图分裂阿拉伯国家之间的团结，以孤立埃及和其它维护自己独立的阿拉伯国家。美国公然参加巴格达条约军事委员会，并向巴格达集团国家和以色列供应大量军火武器，更是向独立的阿拉伯国家进行武力威胁。
    但是，美国这种猖狂的企图，归根到底是要失败的。已经战胜了英法和以色列侵略者的埃及和阿拉伯国家人民，他们将会继续保卫自己祖国的独立和主权而斗争。埃及总统纳赛尔最近对美国记者发表谈话说，苏伊士运河是埃及的土地，帝国主义国家“不能因为埃及维护它的正当权利而指责它不让步，他们再也不能期望我们顺从他们的愿望，屈从他们的要求。”这充分说明了埃及人民保卫主权的坚定决心。埃及和阿拉伯国家人民的正义斗争，一定会继续得到全世界正义人类的同情和支持！
