Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, April 19th: Janos Kadar, Prime Minister of the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government, met with a group of foreign journalists on the 17th and answered questions they posed.

Regarding the invitation to UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld to visit Hungary, Kadar said that no response has yet been received to this invitation. He said, "We are prepared to answer any questions Mr. Hammarskjöld may have and provide him with all necessary explanations regarding the situation in Hungary."

Speaking about past mistakes and correcting them, Kadar said that past mistakes weakened the social system and the state system. These mistakes were primarily reflected in the leadership's detachment from the masses and the relaxation of the struggle against the enemies of socialism. Experience has shown that leaders cannot truly benefit the people if they are not closely connected with the people and do not have their support. On the other hand, if there is no struggle against hostile elements, the people will feel a lack of confidence.

Kadar also stated that the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government are making every effort to get closer to the masses, understand their needs and aspirations, consider their opinions, and consult with them. Currently, gatherings of working people are frequently held domestically. At these meetings, leaders of the Party and the government introduce various measures in economic and cultural construction to the working people, and answer various questions raised by those attending the meetings.

In response to a question about the stationing of Soviet troops in Hungary, Kadar said that, based on an assessment of the current international situation, Hungary must remain loyal to the Warsaw Pact.

    卡达尔对外国记者说
    匈牙利忠于华沙条约
    据新华社布达佩斯19日电　匈牙利工农革命政府总理卡达尔17日接见了一批外国记者，并且回答了他们所提出的问题。
    关于邀请联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德访问匈牙利事，卡达尔说，对这一邀请目前还没有获得答复。他说，我们准备回答哈马舍尔德先生的任何问题，并且向他作有关匈牙利情况的一切必要解释。
    卡达尔在谈到过去的错误和纠正这些错误的问题时说，过去的错误削弱了社会制度和国家制度。这些错误首先表现在领导脱离群众和放松了对社会主义敌人的斗争。经验证明，领导者如果不密切联系人民和得不到人民的支持，就不能真正地为人民谋福利。从另一方面讲，如果不同敌对分子进行斗争，人民就会感到没有信心。
    卡达尔还谈到匈牙利社会主义工人党和工农革命政府正在作一切努力接近群众，了解他们的需要和愿望，考虑他们的意见并且同他们商量。现在，在国内经常举行劳动人民的集会。在这些会上，党和政府的领导人向劳动人民介绍经济建设和文化建设方面的各种措施，解答参加会议的人所提出的各种问题。
    卡达尔在回答关于苏联军队驻扎在匈牙利的问题时说，根据对当前国际局势的估计，匈牙利仍然要忠于华沙条约。
