    Utilizing Nature, Transforming Nature, to Achieve Victory
    Most of the land in the Tianjin Special District is lowland, and crops have been submerged by floods year after year. In 1956, a significant change occurred: several million mu of lowland were saved from crop failure, and some crops even achieved bumper harvests. This is the initial result of the local cadres and organized laboring farmers fighting against unfavorable natural conditions.

    Utilizing nature and conquering nature are the most sublime tasks of human society. China's rural areas have just completed the socialist agricultural cooperativization, and the superiority of more effectively utilizing nature to conquer nature has already been clearly demonstrated. The lowland transformation work in the Tianjin Special District over the past two years fully illustrates this point.

        Year after Year of Disaster
    Hebei is the province most severely affected by floods, and the area most concentrated with flooding is the Tianjin Special District. If we open a map, we can see that the Hai River system (such as the Daqing, Ziya, South Canal, and Yongding Rivers) is scattered across the Hebei Plain, just like the ribs of a paper fan running through the fan's surface; and the lower ends of these ribs all converge on the Tianjin Special District, the fan's handle. Many of the rivers in the Hebei Plain have riverbeds that are higher than the ground, with large upstream flows and small downstream flows. This creates a peculiar situation in the Tianjin Special District: twenty-five rivers meandering and crisscrossing within its borders, plus railways and highways interspersed with the river dikes, with dike banks and roadbeds all one to two meters or two to three meters above the ground. In this way, many grid networks are formed, dividing a large plain into many lowlands. Whenever the autumn rains arrive, on the one hand, the upper reaches of the rivers bring huge amounts of floodwater pouring down, breaching the dikes; on the other hand, local drainage is also unable to discharge, often causing water to rise on flat ground. All floodwater and drainage water converge in the lowest-lying areas, surging mightily, and within a day or two, many lowlands become lakes, washing away crops and turning villages into isolated islands. In total, there are ninety-two large lowlands in the eleven counties of the Tianjin Special District; out of the district's total land area of fifteen million nine hundred thousand mu, the lowlands account for nine million three hundred thousand mu. Therefore, disasters in the Tianjin Special District are frequent and severe. According to investigations by some comrades in the Wen'an Lowland, out of the eighty-four years from 1868 to 1951, there were seventy-two years of disasters, and many years were years of continuous flooding. After liberation, from 1949 to 1954, the Tianjin Special District experienced a total of thirty-five million mu of flooded land and a reduction of four billion jin of grain.
    In the past, under reactionary rule, the people were helpless in the face of famine. During a major flood in 1939, according to a survey in Dataizi Township, Jinghai County, more than four hundred people died of cold and starvation in the township alone. After liberation, thanks to the support and relief from the People's Government, people's lives began to improve. However, because floods could not be controlled, production was extremely unstable, and many farmers also engaged in farming and fishing. In dry years, they sold boats to buy cattle for plowing, and in wet years, they sold cattle to buy boats for fishing. Because it was often a matter of "saving the seeds, not ensuring the harvest," people generally planted crops carelessly. Many cadres here also seemed to be carrying a heavy burden. "Fighting drought for sowing in spring, fully preventing floods in summer, accumulating waterlogging disasters in autumn, and fully carrying out disaster relief in winter," year after year, cycling and repeating, knowing that much of the work was futile, yet unable to avoid doing it. The state consistently exempted taxes and debts and provided grain and loans year after year. In 1954 alone, the state distributed more than six million one hundred thousand yuan in relief funds here, and the state allocated six hundred sixty million jin of grain to the entire special district.
    Year after year of disasters cannot but prompt people to consider how to deal with this natural environment. In the winter of 1954, just after a major flood, a large number of cadres went to the countryside to carry out relief work. The Tianjin District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party proposed: Combining disaster relief, conduct a broad survey of the natural environment of this area and the people's experiences in fighting against disasters. In addition, the District Committee organized five groups to conduct in-depth investigations in various places and reviewed historical data from previous years.

    Understanding Nature is the Foundation for Better Transforming Nature
    Understanding nature is the starting point for further transforming nature. This survey in the Tianjin Special District is of great significance in the history of lowland transformation. During the investigation, the cadres understood the laws of nature: First, they further recognized the specific conditions of spring drought and autumn flooding in their study of historical data. According to statistics from 1939 to 1954, the average rainfall before May each year was 60 mm; while the rainfall in July and August was 500 to 600 mm, and in many cases as high as 700 to 800 mm. This shows that the largest part of the year's rainfall is concentrated in the autumn, and floods are more likely to occur at this time. Second, they understood the topography and water conditions of the entire district. They divided the land in the entire district into high land, flood-prone areas, seasonal waterlogged areas, and perennial waterlogged deep-water areas. They recognized that although these lowlands had a wide water surface, the accumulated water was not deep; especially around the lowlands, the accumulated water was only a few inches or two to three feet, and measures could be taken to drain and store water and plant water-resistant crops to avoid floods. In addition, they also gained a lot of understanding about saline-alkali land.
    The people's experience in fighting against water disasters also gave them great inspiration. In the past, although the general masses in the Tianjin Special District were still accustomed to planting upland crops such as sorghum, corn, millet, and soybeans, some people took measures such as planting water-resistant crops and early-maturing crops to avoid floods. During the investigation, they found that some people used the pools and edges of the lowlands to plant rice, which was not only easier to ensure a harvest, but also greatly increased production. For example, in Zuoge Village area of Wen'an Lowland, the masses were accustomed to planting sorghum and black beans, but Liu Jinrui planted rice in the water-adjacent area in 1949 and obtained a bumper harvest, yielding 1,200 jin per mu. In particular, the discovery of dry rice and submerged rice in places like Dazhongzhuang Lowland and Wen'an Lowland provided them with effective methods for utilizing flood-prone areas and shallow-water areas. Dry rice has the characteristics of being suitable for both dry and wet land, and can be sown in general dry land. If it encounters water, it is easier to propagate. Other rice varieties are prone to die when submerged, while dry rice can survive even if submerged for five or six days, except during the heading and flowering period. The special function of submerged rice is water resistance, and it can be planted in shallow-water areas. If water comes, as long as it does not rise sharply, it can grow with the water. Among them, there is a "Grape Yellow" variety, whose rice stalks can grow to 200 to 300 centimeters. Therefore, even if there are five or six feet of deep water, it can still grow. In addition, it was also found among the masses that planting early-maturing crops can avoid waterlogging. For example, potatoes can be planted in the spring and harvested in the summer, which not only avoids the rainy season but also has a high yield.
    Adapting to Local Conditions and Times, Victory Can Be Achieved Everywhere
    In-depth investigation and research among the masses and on the ground laid a solid foundation for the Tianjin Special District to transform lowlands and change planting methods. In 1955, the Tianjin District Committee decided on a plan to transform lowlands, focusing first on changing planting. All areas suitable for planting rice, submerged rice, and dry rice were planted on a trial basis. Many barren lowlands that had not produced much in the past were opened up for planting. This year, a total of about 600,000 mu of rice was planted, yielding a total of more than 120 million jin of grain, generally two to three times more than in the past. At the same time, 73,000 mu of potatoes were planted in more than 600 townships across the district, yielding a total of 130 million jin; calculated at four jin per jin of grain, the yield was four to five times higher than before the change of planting. Together with other crops, these areas, which often had no harvest or very little harvest, harvested a total of 480 million jin of grain this year, as well as a large amount of hemp, reeds, cattails, fish, and so on. The victory in 1955 gave the people a great stimulus, and the cadres' confidence was also strengthened. Therefore, a large-scale transformation was carried out in 1956. They adopted comprehensive control measures such as flood prevention, drainage, water storage, and irrigation to prevent and eliminate floods, and turned floods into water conservancy. The main experience of the Tianjin Special District in transforming lowlands is to adapt to local conditions and times and adopt various different methods. The transformation of the saline-alkali wasteland in Tuanbowa, Jinghai, first involved diverting fresh water from the Machang River and Duliu River for alkali washing and irrigation, and planting more than 20,000 mu of rice. In 1956, with state investment and assistance, a modern drainage project was built, and 56,000 mu of paddy fields were reclaimed. If the entire replanting project in Tuanbowa is completed, it will be equivalent to the construction of two famous Xiaozhan paddy fields (Xiaozhan paddy fields total about 100,000 mu).
    The transformation of Dazhongzhuang Lowland in Baodi County was done entirely by manual labor. According to the terrain, in addition to consolidating the river dikes all year round, they adopted the method of controlling water by building dikes section by section within the lowland, so that 140,000 mu of land within the lowland was secured and also benefited from irrigation.
    The Jiadao Lowland in Wuqing County has a relatively flat terrain, so they adopted the method of soil ridges and terraced fields for treatment. Three different methods were adopted in planting: corn was planted in high places; potatoes and dry rice were intercropped in the middle; and submerged rice was planted in low places because water was easily stored there. In June last year, there was a rainstorm, but it did not cause waterlogging, ensuring a bumper harvest of potatoes, with an average yield of 1,470 jin per mu. In August, the Yongding River breached its banks, and five of the eight large dikes were flooded, but about 45,000 mu of land were still protected from flooding, of which 35,000 mu yielded a bumper harvest, producing 13.4 million jin of grain. In 1954, this lowland also suffered from floods and only harvested 3.5 million jin of grain, which was only a quarter of last year's yield.
    There are many other methods of transforming lowlands and changing planting. For example, in Jiakou Lowland, according to the unevenness of the lowland, many soil ridges were built to divide the entire lowland into twenty-eight grids. Like using soldiers, they implemented a step-by-step approach to floods. If the water was large, more grids were opened, and if the water was small, fewer grids were opened. In short, floods were not allowed to spread at will, which could ensure less flooding or no flooding. In Jianchapu and Wangbo and other places, equal-height planting was implemented, that is, the land in the lowland was divided into many contour lines according to the flooding situation in previous years, and then the land was divided into deep-water areas, shallow-water areas, water-adjacent areas, and water-passing areas. Lotus roots and fish were raised in deep-water areas, submerged rice was planted in shallow-water areas, ditches were dug to divert water to plant rice in water-adjacent areas, and dry rice was planted in water-passing areas. In this way, planting according to local conditions can ensure a harvest regardless of drought or flood.

    This is the Victory of the Socialist System
    Through such transformation adapting to the times and locations, the Tianjin Special District has transformed a total of fifty-eight lowlands with an area of 4.2 million mu in the past two years. The area planted with rice in 1954 (mostly paddy rice) was only more than 340,000 mu, which increased to 1.97 million mu in 1956. In the past, there was only a very small amount of dry rice planted, which increased to 1.19 million mu last year. In 1954, the entire special district only had more than 7,800 mu of potatoes, which increased to more than 170,000 mu in 1956. Such transformation and replanting greatly stabilized production conditions. The situation of frequent flooding and drought in many areas in the past has been greatly changed, and people can plant fixed crops every year. Except for particularly large floods, general drainage and floods will not cause major problems. According to statistics, systematic irrigation and drainage projects were built on about 300,000 mu of land last year, allowing for stable high-yield planting, and about 2 million mu of land can ensure the harvest of summer and autumn crops under normal water conditions, and 1 million mu of land can ensure the safety of summer grain. In 1954, a major flood occurred in Hebei, and almost all lowlands in the Tianjin Special District were submerged. In 1956, floods and drainage were much larger than in 1954, but only about 1 million mu of the 4.2 million mu of transformed land were submerged, and the remaining 3 million mu were saved, and some replanted high-yield crops also achieved bumper harvests. Last year, due to the transformation of low-lying areas and the reform of general planting, many places turned disaster years into bumper years. According to statistics from 150,000 people in eight lowlands and depressions including Dazhongzhuang Lowland, Tuanbowa, Lianhua Lake, Tangjia Lowland, Jianchapu, Wangbo, and Kuangergang, before the transformation, the average grain per person was only 200 jin in better years; after the transformation and replanting last year, the average grain per person was 900 jin.
    The victory of the lowland transformation in the Tianjin Special District fully demonstrates the superiority of the socialist system. Without the assistance and guidance of the state and the joint efforts of various levels of organs in the Tianjin Special District, it would not have been possible to complete such a huge transformation in such a short period of time; without cooperativization, the masses would have been in a scattered state of individual economy, which would have been difficult to achieve. Because private ownership of land has been eliminated, unified planning has become possible. In 1955, Shijia Lowland in Jinghai County opened a canal to divert water for replanting rice. At that time, there were only elementary cooperatives, and there were also individual farmers outside the cooperative. Because seven households were unwilling to cooperate in replanting, the canal had to be extended by five li. When Hualianzhuang opened a canal, because it occupied a piece of land of a single individual farmer, he would not allow water to pass through. In the past, in addition to private ownership, another very important problem hindering the transformation of lowlands was that labor could not be arranged in a unified manner. As everyone knows, the Tianjin Special District has experienced major floods for several consecutive years. On the one hand, people had to engage in sideline production to earn money for food, and on the other hand, they had to organize spring labor to repair dikes. In both spring and autumn, they had to be busy with sowing. At this time, a large number of manpower had to be drawn to transform the lowlands. If it were in the period of individual farming, it would be impossible at all. Since the overall cooperativization started in the winter before last year, this problem has been solved very smoothly. For example, the Fumin Cooperative in Jinghai County originally had 2,900 male laborers. When sowing and transplanting rice last spring, 1,400 people were drawn to open canals and do other work, and less than 1,500 laborers remained at home. At this time, on the one hand, women were mobilized, and on the other hand, labor was uniformly organized and labor quotas were reasonably revised, giving full play to the enthusiasm of farmers, and finally completing the task of replanting.
    Due to the unified arrangement of labor, agricultural and sideline production and lowland transformation work supported each other. In particular, sideline production not only solved the problem of food, but also extracted a part of the profit to invest in the lowland transformation project, ensuring that many cooperatives could rely on their own efforts in the face of serious disasters and carry out lowland transformation work. According to statistics, most of the seventy-four projects built in the Tianjin Special District in 1956 were completed by the masses themselves. The basic construction of only three projects was invested by the state, and ten projects were jointly funded by the people and the government. Calculated by the earthwork projects constructed, only 6.4% were fully invested by the state, 14% were covered with meals but no wages, and the rest were done by the masses themselves.

    This year, the Tianjin Special District is continuing to advance towards nature and comprehensively control floods. In addition to consolidating last year's achievements, the area of lowland transformation will be expanded to 5 million mu, and it is planned to produce 500 million to 600 million jin of grain.

    利用自然　改造自然　就能胜利
    天津专区大部分土地都是洼地，庄稼连年被大水淹没。1956年发生了很大变化：洼地上有三百几十万亩保住了收成，有些作物还得到了丰收。这是当地干部和组织起来的劳动农民同不利的自然条件作斗争的初步结果。

    利用自然，征服自然，这是人类社会最崇高的任务。我国农村刚刚完成社会主义的农业合作化的工作，更有效地利用自然征服自然的优越性就已经鲜明地显示出来了。天津专区两年来的洼地改造工作，充分地说明了这一点。
        年复一年的灾难
    河北是洪水为患最严重的地区，而水灾最集中的地方就在天津专区。我们打开地图，就可以看出海河水系（如大清、子牙、南运、永定等河），散布在河北平原上，正好像一柄纸扇的扇骨贯串着扇叶；而这些扇骨的下梢都集中于天津专区这个扇柄上。河北平原的河流，很多都是河身高出地面，上游流量大，下游流量小。这就造成天津专区这样一种畸形状况：境内二十五条河流盘桓交错，再加铁路公路与各河河堤互相穿插，堤岸路基都高出地面一、二公尺或二、三公尺。这样，事实上就构成许多格子网，把一块大平原割裂成许多洼地。每当秋雨到来，一方面各河上游挟着巨量洪水倾泻而下，冲决堤防；另一方面本地沥水也因无处宣泄，常常平地起水。所有洪水沥水都往最洼处汇集，浩浩荡荡，波涛汹涌，一日半日之间许多洼地竟成淀泊，田禾一洗而光，村庄顿成孤岛。总计天津专区十一个县，就有大片洼地九十二个；全区土地面积一千五百九十万亩，洼地就占有九百三十万亩。因此，天津专区的灾害经常而且严重。据一些同志在文安洼调查，从1868年到1951年的八十四年中，就有七十二年遭灾，许多年是连年大水，解放以后，从1949年至1954年，六年来天津专区前后共淹土地三千五百万亩，减产粮食四十亿斤。
    在过去反动统治时期，人民一遇灾荒就束手无策。1939年一次大水，据静海大台子乡的调查，全乡因受冻饿而死的，就有四百多人。解放以后，由于人民政府的扶持救济，人民生活开始改善。但因水患无法控制，生产极不稳定，许多农民都兼营农渔业，遇旱年就卖船买牛耕地，遇涝年就卖牛买船治鱼。因为这里常常是“保种不保收”，一般人在种地的时候都很潦草，不少干部在这里也好像背上了一个沉重的包袱。“春天抗旱播种，夏天全力防汛，秋天积涝成灾，冬天全力救灾”，如此年复一年，循环往复，明知许多工作都是枉费心机，却又不能不做。国家在这里一年年总是免税免债，放粮放款。仅1954年，国家在这里发放的救济款就有六百一十余万元，国家调给全专区的粮食达六亿六千万斤。
    年复一年的灾难，不能不促使人们考虑如何对付这种自然环境。1954年冬，正是大水之后，大批的干部下乡作救济工作。中共天津地委提出：结合救灾，广泛调查这个区域的自然环境和人民同灾荒斗争的经验。另外，地委又组织了五个小组专门深入各地进行调查，并检查了历年的历史资料。
    认识自然才能更好地改造自然
    认识自然是进一步改造自然的出发点。天津专区的这次调查，在洼地改造的历史上具有非常重要的意义。干部们在调查中认识了自然规律：第一、他们在研究历史资料中更进一步认识到春旱秋涝的具体状况。据1939年至1954年的统计，平均每年5月以前的降雨量为六十公厘；而7、8月份的降雨量为五百至六百公厘，多的达七、八百公厘。这说明一年中最大部分的雨量都集中在秋季，水灾也多是在这个时候产生的。第二、认识了全区的地形和水情。他们把全区土地分为高地、易涝过水区、季节性积水区、常年积水的深水区。他们认识到，这些洼地虽然水面铺的很宽，但积水并不深；特别洼地四周，积水不过数寸或二、三尺，完全可以采取措施排水蓄水和种植耐涝作物避免水患。另外，对于盐碱地也作了很多了解。
    人民群众对水害斗争的经验也给了他们很大的启示。过去天津专区一般群众习惯虽仍是多种旱地作物，如高粱、玉米、谷子、大豆等，然而也有一些人采取种植耐涝作物早熟作物等办法避过了水灾。在调查中，他们发现有人利用水洼和洼边种植稻谷，不仅比较容易保收，还能大大增产。如文安洼左各庄一带群众都习惯于种高粱黑豆，而刘金瑞在1949年利用临水区种了水稻，获得大丰收，每亩产一千二百斤。特别是在大中庄洼、文安洼等地对陆稻、淀稻的发现，使他们对易涝区和浅水区的利用提出了有效的办法。陆稻有水旱两宜的特性，一般旱地都可播种，如果遇水更易繁殖。别的稻子水一没顶就容易死去，而陆稻除了莠穗扬花时期，即水没顶五、六天也能成活。淀稻的特殊作用是耐水，它可以种在浅水区，如遇水来，只要不是猛涨，它可以随水上长。其中有一种“葡萄黄”品种，稻秆可以长到二百至三百公分，因此，水来以后，即使有五尺六尺的深水，也可以生长。另外，在群众中也发现了种植早熟作物可以避涝。如马铃薯，春天播种，夏天就可以收获，不仅可以避开雨涝季节，而且产量很高。
    因地因时制宜，到处都能胜利
    深入群众深入实地的调查研究，给天津专区改造洼地、改变种植方法打下有力的基础。1955年，天津地委决定了改造洼地的计划，首先着重改种。凡是宜于种植水稻、淀稻、陆稻的地区，都进行试种。许多向来没有多少出产的荒洼，他们都开辟种植。这年共种稻子约六十万亩，共收粮食一亿二千多万斤，一般比过去多产两三倍。同时，在全区六百多个乡试种马铃薯七万三千亩，共产一亿三千万斤；以四斤折一斤粮食计算，比改种前多收四、五倍。连同其他作物，使这些常常不收或收成很少的地区，这一年共收了四亿八千万斤粮食，还有大量的麻、苇蒲、鱼等等。1955年的胜利给人民群众一个很大的刺激，干部信心也增强了。于是，在1956年就进行了大规模的改造。他们采取防涝、排水、蓄水、灌溉等综合治理办法防除水患，并且变水患为水利。天津专区改造洼地的主要经验是因地因时制宜，采取各种不同的办法。静海团泊洼盐碱荒地的改造，先是引马厂减河和独流减河的淡水洗碱灌溉，修改种水稻二万余亩。1956年，由国家投资援助，筑了现代化的排水工程，开垦稻田五万六千亩。如果团泊洼的改种工程全部完成，就等于两个闻名的小站稻田的建设（小站稻田共约十万亩）。
    宝坻县大中庄洼的改造，全用人工，根据地形，他们除常年巩固河堤之外，在洼内采取了节节控制打埝束水的办法，使洼内十四万亩土地得到安全，同时还得到灌溉之利。
    武清县夹道洼地势比较平整，他们便完全采取土埂畦田的办法治理。在种植上采取三种不同办法：在高处种玉米；在中间实行马铃薯和陆稻间作；在低处，因容易存水，便蓄水种淀稻。去年6月曾发生一次暴雨，没有形成涝灾，保证了马铃薯的丰收，平均亩产一千四百七十斤。8月永定河决口，八道大埂淹了五道，仍保住了约四万五千亩土地未被淹没，其中有三万五千亩获得丰收，共产粮食一千三百四十万斤。1954年这洼也遭洪水，只收粮食三百五十万斤，仅为去年产量的四分之一。
    其他改造洼地和改变种植的方法还很多。如在贾口洼按照洼内高低不平的情况，打了很多土埂，把全洼分割为二十八块格子，好像用兵一样，对洪水实行步步为营，如果水大就多开网格，如果水小就少开网格，总之不使洪水随便泛滥，这就可以保证少淹或不淹。在煎茶铺和王泊等地实行等高种植，即把洼内土地按历年被淹状况，划成许多等高线，然后把土地分为深水区、浅水区、临水区、过水区等，在深水区种藕养鱼，浅水区种淀稻，临水区开沟引水种水稻，过水区种陆稻。这样因地种植，无论水旱都能保收。
    这是社会主义制度的胜利
    经过这样因时因地的改造，天津专区两年来共改造五十八个洼地，土地四百二十万亩。稻子在1954年（绝大部分是水稻）只有三十四万多亩，到1956年发展到一百九十七万亩。陆稻过去只有极少量的种植，在去年就发展到一百一十九万亩。马铃薯1954年全专区只有七千八百多亩，1956年就发展到十七万多亩。他们这样的改造和改种，使生产条件大为稳定。过去许多地区时涝时旱的状况已经大为改观，人们可以年年固定种植。除了特大的洪水，一般沥水和洪水都不致发生大患。据统计，去年约在三十万亩土地上修建了有系统的灌溉排水工程，可以进行稳定的高产种植，约有二百万亩土地在一般水情下可以使夏秋两季作物保收，一百万亩土地可以使夏粮安全无虞。1954年河北发生大水，天津专区所有洼地几乎全被淹没。1956年洪水沥水都比1954年大得多，而被改造的四百二十万亩土地中，只有约一百万亩土地被淹没，其余三百几十万亩土地都保住收成，某些改种的高产作物还得到丰收。去年由于低洼地区的改造和一般种植的改革，使很多地方的灾年变为丰年。据大中庄洼、团泊洼、莲花淀、唐家洼、煎茶铺、王泊、筐儿港等八个洼淀十五万人口的统计，改造前较好的年头，每人平均粮食不过二百斤；去年经过改造改种，每人平均有粮食九百斤。
    天津专区洼地改造的胜利，充分显示了社会主义制度的优越性。如果没有国家的援助指导和天津专区各级机关的共同努力，就不可能在如此短促的时间内完成这样巨大的改造；如果没有合作化，群众都处于个体经济的分散状态，这也是很难实现的。由于消灭了土地私有制，统一筹划才成为可能。静海县施家洼1955年开渠引水改种稻子，当时只有初级社，社外还有单干农民，由于七户不愿意合作改种，使渠道多修了五里地。胡连庄开渠道因占了一家单干农民的地头，他就不让走水。过去改造洼地的障碍，除了私有制以外，还有一个很重要的问题，就是劳动不能统一安排。大家知道，天津专区接连几年都是大水灾，人们一方面要搞副业赚钱吃饭，一方面要组织春工复堤，春秋都要忙于播种，这时又要抽出大批人力改造洼地，如果在单干时期，根本就不可能。从前年冬季开始全盘合作化以来，这一问题就很顺利地解决了。如静海县富民社原有二千九百个男劳动力，去春播种插秧时，抽出开渠和作其他工作的就达一千四百个，家里剩下的劳动力不足一千五百人，在这个时候一方面发动妇女，一方面统一组织劳力并合理修改劳动定额，高度发挥农民积极性，终于完成了改种任务。
    由于劳动力的统一安排，使农副业生产和洼地改造工作起了互相支援的作用。特别是，副业生产，不仅解决了吃饭问题，而且还抽出了一部分赢利向洼地改造工程投资，保证了许多合作社在严重的灾荒面前自力更生，进行了洼地改造工作。据统计，天津专区1956年所修的七十四项工程，绝大部分都是以群众自己的力量完成的，只有三项工程的基本建设是由国家投资，十项是民办公助。如果以兴修的土方工程计算，全由国家投资的只占6.4％，管饭而不发工资的占14％，其余都是靠群众自己的力量办的。
    天津专区今年正继续向大自然进军，全面治理水患。除了巩固去年的成绩以外，还要把洼地改造的面积扩大到五百万亩，计划生产粮食五亿斤到六亿斤。
