    Kabul New Year Scenery

    According to the calendar of the Kingdom of Afghanistan, March 21st of this year marks the New Year of 1336. On this day, Afghans celebrated their New Year with festive spirits. At the break of dawn, despite the intermittent drizzle, Afghans flocked from all directions to the southern part of Kabul.

    Here, at the foot of the mountain, among clusters of scattered graves, stands a small Islamic domed building, a symbolic tomb of Ali, the fourth disciple and son-in-law of the founder of Islam, Muhammad, and the founder of the Shia sect of Islam. Legend has it that Ali, before his death, instructed people to place his body on a camel, untie the reins, and let it wander. The place where the camel finally stopped would be where he should be buried. People believe that Ali's burial place is in today's Mazar-i-Sharif city (Persian for "Noble Shrine") in the Mazar-i-Sharif province of Afghanistan. The Ali tomb in the southern part of Kabul is merely symbolic. Every New Year's Day—according to legend, also Ali's birthday—tens of thousands of Afghans gather in front of the Ali tomb for religious commemorative ceremonies. The Ali tomb is also called "Zah," as another name for Ali is "Zah."

    The commemorative ceremony began, and people carried a flagpole out of the "Zah" shrine, kneeling around it to pray. The religious atmosphere was very strong, with some reciting prayers and others weeping as they prayed. This flagpole is called "Janda," and it does not have a flag on it, but the flagpole itself is wrapped in green or red cloth. Every year on this day when the "Janda" is brought out, it is replaced with new cloth. In Mazar-i-Sharif, the "Janda" will stand in the square for forty days from this day, and then be stored away; but in Kabul, it is generally only displayed for about two weeks.

    In the seven weeks around the New Year, many people come to the "Zah" shrine every Friday (the Islamic day of rest). Many come here to pray, but many others simply come to join in the fun and pass their holidays. On Fridays, a small market appears here, somewhat like a temple fair in our country. All kinds of vendors gather here, most of them are snack stalls. They light fires on the uneven slopes and set up frying pans to sell various snacks. There is fried fish, and also a kind of fried dough that I don't know the name of. Open-air tea houses also operate here temporarily. Blankets are laid on the ground, and people sit on them to drink tea, chat, and watch the fun. Many children sell small colored candles in the market, which are for the faithful to use for worship in the shrine.

    This also becomes a place of entertainment for children. They can ride on windmills or wooden horse roundabouts for twenty-five puls (about four fen RMB). It is rare to find these things on ordinary days. They also buy many cheap, crude toys here. In the afternoon, among the crowds leaving "Zah," many children carry one or two of their favorite things. Imported toys sold in city stores are too expensive for ordinary people to afford, so the children of Kabul are overjoyed at the New Year, as they can go to the market to buy some of their favorite toys.

    About thirty or forty meters away from the "Zah" shrine is a huge rock about ten circumferences thick. In its center, a narrow passage less than a meter wide and about two meters long has been split open. According to legend, this was split by Ali with a sharp sword, and those who have done wrong and illegitimate children cannot pass through it.

    On New Year's Day, many Kabul residents, old and young, lined up to walk through the crack in this giant rock in turn. Because the passage is very narrow, people can only slowly squeeze through sideways; fat people, especially those with big bellies, are of course inconvenient to pass through.

    On the afternoon of New Year's Day, celebrations are also held in Babur Park in Kabul. The tomb of King Babur is in this park. According to historical records, Babur set out from Kabul, the capital of today's Afghanistan, in the early 16th century, invaded and occupied most of India, and established a great empire—the Mughal Empire.

   "Mughal" means "Mongol" in Hindi, because historians believe that Babur was a descendant of Genghis Khan; but others believe that he belonged to a tribe in Central Asia. Babur was not only a talented military leader and shrewd ruler, but he also loved literature and art. In his poems and diaries, he repeatedly expressed his nostalgia and admiration for Kabul. Therefore, after his death, his subordinates followed his will and transported his body back to Kabul for burial.

    New Year's Day is also the traditional Arbor Day, so the celebrations in Babur Park also include a tree-planting program. About a dozen people dug holes in a very short time on an area of about fifty square meters, and then planted saplings. The rain stopped and started again, which was quite disappointing, but all the programs proceeded according to the scheduled procedure. There was a small animal exhibition, wrestling, and juggling. There was also a sheep fighting program: people formed a circle to watch a black sheep and a white sheep collide with each other. After only two rounds of fighting, the white sheep retreated weakly. To be honest, the program was not particularly exciting, but people came here to celebrate the New Year with great pleasure, because from this day on, another year begins, and the peace-loving Afghans have new and beautiful wishes for the coming year.

    喀布尔新年风光
    冯培
    按照阿富汗王国的历法，今年的3月21日是它的1336年的元旦。这一天，阿富汗人怀着节日的心情，欢度自己的新年。天曚曚亮，尽管时密时疏地下着细雨，阿富汗人还是从四面八方涌向喀布尔的南城。
    这里，在山脚下，在一簇簇的乱坟中，有一座不大的伊斯兰教圆顶式的建筑物，这是伊斯兰教的创始人穆罕默德的第四位弟子和女婿、伊斯兰教十叶派的创始人阿里的一个象征性的坟墓。据传说，阿里在临终前嘱咐人们把他的尸体放在一只骆驼上，解开缰绳，任它漂泊，骆驼最后停下来的地方，就是埋葬他的地方。人们相信，阿里的葬地就是今天阿富汗的马查里·沙里夫省的马查里·沙里夫市（波斯文的意思是“圣冢”）。在喀布尔南城的阿里墓仅仅是象征性的，每逢元旦佳节——根据传说，元旦也就是阿里的诞辰——因此成千成万的阿富汗人聚集在阿里墓前举行宗教的纪念仪式。阿里墓也称为“扎赫”，因为阿里的另一个名字叫做“扎赫”。
    纪念仪式开始了，人们从“扎赫”祠里抬出一根旗杆，团团围着它跪下祈祷。宗教的气氛非常浓厚，有些人念祈祷词，也有些人一边祈祷一边哭泣。这根旗杆叫做“占达”，上面不挂旗子，但旗杆本身却用绿布或红布缠绕着。每年这一天“占达”被抬出来的时候，都要换上新布。在马查里·沙里夫，“占达”从这一天起将在广场上竖立四十天，然后再收藏起来；但是在喀布尔，一般只在外面放两星期左右。
    在新年前后的七个星期内，每个星期五（伊斯兰教的休息日）都有许多人到“扎赫”祠来。许多人是来这里祈祷的，但也有不少人只是为了凑热闹和消磨他们的假日。在星期五这一天，这里就出现一个小型集市，有点像我国的庙会，各式各样的小贩都群集到这里来，最多的是小吃摊，在一片高低不平的坡上，他们生上火，放上一个煎锅，出售各种小吃。这里有炸鱼，也有一种叫不出名字来的炸面团。露天的茶馆也临时在这里营业，地上铺着几条毯子，人们就坐在上面一边喝茶聊天，一边瞧热闹。有许多小孩拿着各种颜色的小蜡烛在市集里叫卖，这些蜡烛是供教徒在祠内礼拜用的。
    这里也成为孩子们的一个娱乐场所。他们花上二十五普尔（约合人民币四分钱）就可坐一回风车或木马转轮。在平常日子里，是难得找到这种玩意的。他们也在这里买到许多便宜的粗制玩具。下午，在离开“扎赫”的人流中，许多小孩手里都拿着一两件他们心爱的东西。市内商店出售的进口玩具价钱太贵，一般人买不起，因此喀布尔的孩子们一到新年就喜出望外，他们可以到市集去买到一些心爱的玩具了。
    离“扎赫”祠大约三、四十公尺的地方有一块十来围粗的巨石，它的中央，开裂成一条宽不满一公尺，长约两公尺的狭窄的通道，据传说，这是阿里用利剑劈成的，做过亏心事的人和私生子都走不过去。
    新年这一天，许多喀布尔的居民，老的少的，排成长队，挨次走过这块巨石的裂口。因为通道很窄，所以人们只能侧着身子慢慢挤过；肥胖的人，尤其是大肚子的人，当然就不便通过了。
    新年这一天下午，在喀布尔市内的巴卑尔公园也举行庆祝活动。巴卑尔王的陵墓就在这个公园里。据史书记载，巴卑尔在十六世纪初叶，从今天的阿富汗京城喀布尔出发，侵入并占领了印度的大部，建立了一个大帝国——大莫卧儿王朝。
  “莫卧儿”在印地语中是“蒙古”的意思，因为史学家们认为巴卑尔是成吉思汗的后裔；但是也有人认为他属于中亚细亚的一个部族。巴卑尔不仅是个天才的军事领袖和精明的统治者，他也很爱好文学和艺术。在他的诗篇和日记里不只一次地流露出他对喀布尔的留恋和爱慕。因此在他死后，他的部下遵照他的遗嘱把他的遗体运回喀布尔埋葬。
    新年这一天也是传统的植树节，所以在巴卑尔公园举行的庆祝活动中也包括一项种树节目，大约有十几个人在很短的时间内，在一片大约五十平方公尺的地面上挖好了坑，然后把树苗种上。雨还是停一会下一会，给人扫兴不少，但是所有节目还是按预定的程序进行了。这一天有小型的动物展览、角力和杂耍之类。还有一项节目是斗羊：人们围成一圈，观看一只黑羊和一只白羊互相冲撞，仅仅斗了两个回合，那只白羊便力怯而退了。说实在的，节目并没有特别精彩的地方，但是人们却是抱着极愉快的心情到这里来庆祝新年的，因为从这一天起，又是一个年头开始了，热爱和平生活的阿富汗人对于未来的一年怀着新的美好的愿望。（附图片）
