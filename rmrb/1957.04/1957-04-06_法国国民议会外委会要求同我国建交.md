Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 5th: The "French Research and Information Bureau Bulletin" states that the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National Assembly has unanimously approved a draft resolution proposed by MP Deran, requesting the government to recognize China. MP Goula Satte also advocated for the signing of trade treaties with Eastern European People's Democracies after recognizing China.

The bulletin pointed out that some French political figures have repeatedly stated that since France maintains normal diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and various People's Democracies, there is no reason not to establish similar relations with China.

    法国国民议会外委会
    要求同我国建交
    据新华社5日讯　巴黎消息：“法国研究和资料局公报”说，国民议会外交委员会已经一致通过了议员德朗提出的一项决议草案，要求政府承认中国。议员果拉·萨特还主张在承认中国之后，同东欧人民民主国家签订贸易条约。
    公报指出，法国一些政治人物曾经屡次表示，法国既然同苏联和各人民民主国家保持着正常的外交关系，就没有任何理由不同中国建立类似的关系。
