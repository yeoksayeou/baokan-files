Strive to Meet the Needs of the Construction Site

The key Yellow River control project, the Sanmenxia Project, has officially commenced. This is a great and arduous project. The supply and marketing cooperative system must promptly and actively support the people building Sanmenxia.

Under the leadership of the local Party and government departments, the supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in Henan Province should proactively complete the construction site supply work that should be undertaken by the supply and marketing cooperatives. They should regularly care about the needs of the construction site workers and do everything possible to support the construction site. The supply and marketing cooperatives of various provinces should also actively complete the allocation and supply plans for materials needed by the construction site, such as mao bamboo, hemp, brown ropes, and brown fiber, in order to meet the needs of the Sanmenxia construction site.

    尽量满足工地需要
    根治黄河的重点工程三门峡工程正式开工了。这是一个伟大而艰巨的工程，供销合作系统要及时地、积极地支援建设三门峡的人们。
    河南省各级供销社，应当在当地党政部门的领导下，主动地完成应该由供销社担负的工地供应工作，要经常关心工地职工的需要，尽一切力量给工地以支持。各省供销社对于工地需要的物资，如毛竹、麻类、棕绳、棕片等等，也应积极完成调拨供应计划，以满足三门峡工地的需要。（全国供销合作总社）
