Moscow dispatch, April 5th: The Soviet Union has achieved new successes in the peaceful utilization of atomic energy. More than 400 reports on these achievements will be presented at the All-Soviet Scientific and Technological Conference. This conference opened on the 4th in the Great Hall of Moscow University on Lenin Hills. It is jointly convened by the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the Soviet General Administration for the Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy. This is the All-Soviet Scientific and Technological Conference on using radioactive and stable isotopes and radiation in the national economy and science. More than 4,000 scientists and engineers are participating in the conference. Scientists from our country and other People's Democratic countries, as well as Britain and the United States, are attending the conference.

At the plenary session on the 4th, Academician Topchiev, Academic Secretary of the Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, delivered the opening speech. He said: The purpose of this conference is to summarize the research on the use of isotopes and radiation and to discuss future directions. There are many scientific papers, and it is impossible to present them all at the conference, so only more than 400 reports will be presented. Isotopes are widely used in various industrial sectors such as chemistry, metallurgy, machinery, and petroleum, as well as in agriculture and medicine, and they are of particularly significant importance in biological research. Isotopes are also used to explore and determine mineral deposits such as oil and coal. Isotopes play a significant role in the exploration of manganese, cobalt, and other mineral deposits. By using nuclear radiation, the properties of plastics can be changed. Nuclear radiation greatly aids in food preservation, drug sterilization, and the fight against crop pests and diseases. Using nuclear radiation, it is possible to obtain nitric acid from the nitrogen in the air, which is of great significance. The effect of radiation on heredity is also being studied.

Topchiev also welcomed foreign guests to present scientific papers at this conference. Subsequently, Corresponding Member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Meteiev, delivered a report on "The Prospects of Utilizing Nuclear Radiation in Chemistry," and Professor Dakhnov reported on the achievements of Soviet science and industry in using radioactive methods to search for, explore, and determine mineral deposits. The plenary session on the 4th also scheduled four reports, including "The Development of Isotope Production in the Soviet Union."

The conference will last for a week. In addition to three plenary sessions, the other sessions will be group meetings. Foreign guests will read scientific papers at the group meetings.

    总结使用同位素和射线的研究
    全苏科学技术会议开幕
    人民民主国家和美英都有科学家参加
    本报莫斯科5日电　苏联在和平利用原子核能方面取得了新的成就，四百多个关于这些成就的报告将在全苏科学技术会议上发表。这个会议4日在列宁山上的莫斯科大学大礼堂开幕。它是苏联科学院和苏联和平利用原子能总局联合召开的。这是关于在国民经济中和科学中使用放射性和稳定性的同位素和射线的全苏科学技术会议。有四千多科学工作者和工程师参加这次会议。我国和其他人民民主国家以及英国、美国都有科学家出席会议。
    在4日全体会议上，苏联科学院主席团学术秘书长托普切夫院士致开幕词。他说：这次会议的目的是总结使用同位素和射线的研究和讨论今后的方向。科学论文很多，不可能都在会议上发表，所以只将发表四百多个报告。同位素广泛地运用在化学、冶金、机械、石油各个工业部门和农业、医疗上，在生物学研究中具有特别重大的意义。同位素也被用来勘探和确定石油、煤等矿藏。在勘探锰、钴等矿藏时，同位素的作用很大。利用核子射线，可以改变塑料的特性。核子射线大大有助于食品的保藏、药品的消毒和对农作物病虫害的斗争。利用核子射线，可能从空气的氮中取得硝酸，这有巨大的意义。射线对遗传性的影响也在研究中。
    托普切夫也欢迎外国来宾在这次会议上发表科学论文。接着，苏联科学院通讯院士梅捷也捷夫作了“在化学中利用核子射线的远景”报告，达赫诺夫教授报告了苏联科学和工业在利用放射性方法寻找、勘探和确定矿藏方面的成就。4日全会上预定的还有“苏联同位素的生产的发展”等四个报告。
    这次会议将开一周，除了三次全会以外，其他为分组会议。在分组会议上将有外国来宾宣读科学论文。
