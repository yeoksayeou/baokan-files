Xinhua News Agency, April 28th Dispatch from Washington: U.S. State Department officials admit that the current enthusiastic discussions in all circles of China on how to correctly handle contradictions among the people demonstrates China's confidence and strength.

The news revealed that U.S. State Department officials are closely watching news reports in Chinese newspapers regarding this issue. It said that the Communist Party's published news about China's internal "difficulties" "may indicate that the strength and confidence of the Communist Party are constantly growing, not the opposite." The news quoted a U.S. State Department official as saying that this fact "shows that the Communist government has enough confidence to allow the publication of such news without any particular anxiety."

The news continued that the Communists may also publish other difficult situations, but exposing difficulties is "not out of fear but out of a confidence that the Communists are so strong that they can safely expose some of the shortcomings in the country."
