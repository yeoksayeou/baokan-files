    Spring Scene
    Sheng Xian
    The gentle breeze is like a mother's hand,
    Gently, gently caressing the chest,
    The sunshine uses fiery lips to melt the accumulated snow,
    The small stream sings softly beneath the thin ice....
    The Chongchon River sends away the silver ice floes,
    Welcoming groups of washing girls.
    Waves of singing are like crisp silver bells,
    Singing so that the fisherman forgets to retract his net.
    A soldier sits under a tree mending his uniform,
    This moving song makes him dazed,
    The steel needle quietly falls from his hand,
    His heart flies back to his hometown with the spring breeze.
    Appearing before his eyes is a fertile land,
    Leading everyone in spring plowing is a girl with long braids.
    I don't know what this soldier is thinking of again,
    A sweet smile flashes across his dark red face.
    March 8, 1957, in Chongju, Korea

    春景
    省先
    和风像母亲的手，
    轻轻地轻轻地抚摸着胸膛，
    阳光用火热的嘴唇吻化了积雪，
    小溪在薄冰下低低的歌唱……。
    清川江送走了银色的冰块，
    迎来了一群群洗衣的姑娘。
    阵阵的歌声像清脆的银铃，
    唱的那渔夫忘记了收网。
    一位战士坐在树下缝补军装，
    这动人的歌声使他迷惘，
    钢针从他手上悄悄的落下，
    心儿随着春风飞回了故乡。
    出现在他眼前的是一片肥美的土地，
    带领众人春耕的是位拖着长辫的姑娘。
    不知这战士又想起了什么，
    甜美的笑容掠过了他黑红的脸膛。
    1957年，3，8，于朝鲜定州
