    This meeting has been very successful. Everyone raised many questions, and after several days of discussion and research, some questions have been resolved; some questions will be gradually resolved in future work. In addition to thanking you for your efforts, I would like to take this opportunity to express some opinions on demobilization work.
    To do a good job in demobilization work, we must have a correct understanding of this work and a correct view of demobilized soldiers.
    What kind of work is demobilization work? I think it should be understood in this way: demobilization work is a part of the entire socialist construction work. Since the national victory, demobilization work has become an important task for the government and the army. Especially after the implementation of the compulsory military service system, this work has taken on new significance. Accumulating a strong reserve force is an important task related to our national security. The regular demobilization of active soldiers into the reserve is an important measure for us to accumulate reserve forces. Reducing military and administrative expenses to strengthen the country's economic construction is the established policy of our Party and the government, and the most effective way to reduce military and administrative expenses is to reduce the size of the standing army. Demobilization work is precisely to achieve this goal. At the same time, the planned transfer of soldiers who have received long-term education, have high political awareness, and strong organizational discipline to various production fronts is also a strong support for national economic construction. Therefore, demobilization work is related to both national defense construction and economic construction. Doing this work well can enhance our strength. If it is not done well, it will be detrimental to both national defense construction and economic construction.
    Demobilized soldiers are a valuable and positive force in the country. Mobilizing the positive factors of millions of demobilized soldiers to participate in socialist construction is an important task for Party and state organs. The placement of demobilized soldiers should be carried out according to the national principle of "overall planning, comprehensive consideration, and appropriate arrangement." If demobilized soldiers are not properly placed, or if they are placed but not given good ideological education, and some existing problems in the current work are not properly resolved, the positive factors may be transformed into negative factors, increasing internal contradictions among the people.
    The quality of the vast majority of demobilized soldiers is good. They were active elements in the countryside before joining the army, and they were all selected when they joined the army. Many fathers and mothers sent their sons, and wives sent their husbands. After joining the army, they underwent long-term education and war training, and their political awareness improved. A large number of them are Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, and meritorious models, and some of them have learned certain skills. They have all made certain contributions to the cause of liberation of the Chinese people.
    For this group of people, we should follow the instructions of the Central Committee: "Not only should we rely on and use them well in peaceful construction, but we also need to rely on them as the backbone when the country is in trouble, so as to rapidly strengthen national defense forces."
    However, some comrades lack a correct understanding of demobilized soldiers, failing to see their essence, and only one-sidedly emphasize that demobilized soldiers are "unfamiliar with their jobs"; some even mistakenly believe that demobilized soldiers "like to offer opinions and are difficult to lead." Therefore, some units do not adopt a welcoming attitude towards demobilized soldiers, but regard the placement of demobilized soldiers as a "burden," failing to pay attention to their education, failing to care about their lives, failing to actively and enthusiastically unite with them, and even discriminating against, attacking, or excluding them. Although these phenomena are isolated in each region, each enterprise, and each factory, the number of demobilized soldiers is in the millions. If concentrated, the number is not small, and some are very serious, and must be corrected.
    A few demobilized soldiers have violated laws and disciplines, and made unreasonable demands, causing a negative impact among the people. We must strengthen the management and education of these people in particular, and take appropriate action against those with serious circumstances, and punish those who violate the law according to law. Both aspects are very important: on the one hand, educate them, unite them, and educate them to become positive factors in socialist construction; on the other hand, deal with individual bad elements according to the severity of the circumstances and in accordance with the law. Only in this way can we distinguish right from wrong and uphold justice.
    In recent years, there have been more than five million demobilized and transferred personnel. Including the personnel demobilized this year, there will be six million people demobilized to rural areas, cities, and factories and mines across the country. The distribution is very wide, and there are many problems. In particular, with the implementation of the compulsory military service system, a new batch of conscripts will be transferred from active service to the reserve every year. Therefore, there will be more and more demobilized and retired personnel in the future. In order to do this work well, we must strengthen the management and education of demobilized and retired personnel, and check on their placement. Although the placement of conscripts after retirement is easier than that of volunteers, there are still some issues that need to be resolved appropriately. This shows that demobilization and retirement will become a regular and long-term task. Therefore, it is required that Party committees and governments at all levels constantly strengthen their leadership over this work. The most important thing is to strengthen the ideological leadership of cadres, improve cadres' understanding of demobilization work, correct incorrect views, and promptly solve problems that arise in the work. If this is not done, and this arduous task is completely pushed to the business departments, it will be difficult to do well. This has been proven by the experience of recent years. Not only demobilization work, but also other work related to the masses is the same, and it cannot be done well without the support and leadership of the Party committee.
    The vast majority of demobilized soldiers come from rural areas, and it is entirely correct to mobilize them to return to rural areas to participate in agricultural production. Because, for the whole country, the place that can accommodate the most people is the countryside, and the aspect that can accommodate the most people is agriculture. Therefore, engaging in agricultural production is the main aspect of arranging demobilized soldiers in the future, and it is also their main way of employment in the future. However, some demobilized soldiers have incorrect ideas such as not wanting to return to rural areas, thinking that rural life is hard, and that returning to rural production is "unpromising." We should especially strengthen education for this part of the people. Since we can mobilize them to join the army and engage in arduous combat life, not afraid of bloodshed and sacrifice; of course, we can also mobilize them to return to rural areas and actively participate in agricultural production. Whether participating in combat or participating in production, the ultimate goal is for the cause of the people and the cause of the motherland. The interests of the country are consistent with his personal interests, therefore, we can persuade them. But they have been away from home for a long time, their production skills may not be skilled enough, and they may even have some difficulties in life, such as some without houses to live in, and some who are lonely and helpless. These problems may seem small to some people, but they are big problems for them. Therefore, grass-roots organizations should always pay attention to helping them solve their difficulties in production and life. This is of great help to stabilize their emotions and make them feel at ease in agricultural production. In addition, demobilized soldiers should also be properly placed politically and organizationally, and their political honor should be respected. Cadres and the masses should be educated to welcome demobilized soldiers back to production in the same way that they were sent to the army. When they joined the army, they beat gongs and drums, rode horses and wore flowers, and they should also take appropriate ways to express their welcome when they return, and don't be cold. When demobilized soldiers return to rural areas, they can hold appropriate meetings to express their welcome. At the meeting, ask demobilized soldiers to talk about their study and work in the army, and ask old demobilized soldiers and the masses to talk about their experience in settling down and producing. This is good for doing a good job in resettlement and promoting unity between the army and the people. It is also necessary to absorb demobilized soldiers to participate in the militia and serve as the backbone of the militia.
    Recently, the Central Committee instructed: "Among the grass-roots cadres in rural areas, a part should be outstanding elements from demobilized soldiers, which is good for doing a good job in rural work and uniting and educating all demobilized soldiers. Party committees at all levels should implement this as an important policy." This is entirely correct.
    Finally, the army also has a major responsibility for doing a good job in demobilization work. Strengthening the political education of demobilized soldiers and raising their ideological awareness is an important guarantee for mobilizing them to return to production smoothly. This work must first be done by the army. Although the army has done a lot of work in this regard, there are also some shortcomings. Some troops are eager to send people away before their education is mature, holding an attitude of getting rid of the matter, which adds difficulties to the work. In the future, the army must resolutely implement the provision of "not leaving if the education is not mature," and conscientiously do a good job in the ideological education of demobilized soldiers. The education of demobilized soldiers must be realistic. Do not unilaterally exaggerate the good aspects after demobilization, and reduce or conceal the difficult aspects. We should fully believe that demobilized soldiers, after appropriate education and mobilization, can happily return to production. Facts have proved that the vast majority of demobilized soldiers have enthusiastically responded to the call of the Party and the government. The army should send capable cadres to lead the sending work of demobilized soldiers, and continue to do so until the demobilized soldiers are properly handed over to the local reception. Military representatives of military regions, military sub-districts, military service organs at all levels, and factories should also, under the unified leadership of local Party committees at all levels, actively assist local professional organs in doing a good job in the resettlement, management, and education of demobilized soldiers, and list it as their regular work, opposing the attitude of standing by. In short, the army must actively assist the local government in doing a good job in demobilization work, which is one of the important tasks to enhance the unity between the army and the local government, and between the army and the people.
    Our task is to organize the great strength of millions of demobilized soldiers to participate in socialist economic construction and the construction of national defense reserve forces. Although there will still be many difficulties in the work, under the national policy of "overall planning, comprehensive consideration, and appropriate arrangement," relying on the efforts of leading comrades at all levels and the support of the broad masses of the people, coupled with the close cooperation of the army, this major task can be successfully achieved.

    调动复员军人的积极因素　加强社会主义经济建设
    彭德怀副总理4月20日在全国复员工作会议上的讲话
    这次会议开得很好。大家提出了不少问题，经过几天的讨论、研究，有些问题已经解决了；有些问题要在今后工作中逐步加以解决。除了感谢你们的努力外，现在我还想趁着这个机会，就复员工作发表一点意见。
    要想作好复员工作，就要对这项工作有正确的认识，对复员军人也要有正确的看法。
    复员工作是一件什么样的工作呢？我想应当这样认识：复员工作是整个社会主义建设工作中的一部分。自从全国胜利以后，复员工作就成为政府和军队的一项重要工作，特别是实行义务兵役制以后，这项工作更有了新的意义。积蓄强大的后备力量，它是关系到我们国家安全的一项重要任务。现役军人定期复员转入预备役，就是我们积蓄后备力量的重要措施。削减军政费用加强国家的经济建设，是我们党和政府的既定方针，而削减军政费用的最有效办法，就是削减常备兵员，复员工作正是为了达到这个目的。同时把经过长期教育、政治觉悟较高、组织纪律性较强的兵员，有计划地输送到各个生产战线上去，对于国家经济建设也正是有力的支援。因此，复员工作既关系到国防建设，又关系到经济建设，这项工作要做得好，就可以增强我们的力量，如果做不好，对于国防建设和经济建设都是不利的。
    复员军人是国家的一批宝贵的积极力量。调动几百万复员军人的积极因素参加社会主义建设，是党和国家机关的一项重要工作。对于复员军人的安置工作，应根据国家“统筹兼顾，适当安排”的原则进行。如果对复员军人安置不当，或者是安置了，而不很好地对他们进行思想教育，对当前工作中存在的一些问题不做适当的解决，就可能会将积极因素变为消极因素，增加人民内部的矛盾。
    复员军人的品质绝大多数是好的，他们入伍前是农村中的积极分子，入伍的时候都是经过挑选的，很多的父亲母亲送儿子，妻子送丈夫，入伍后又经过部队长期的教育和战争锻炼，政治觉悟提高了。他们中间有很大一部分人是共产党员、青年团员和功臣模范，而且还有一部分人学到了一定的技术，他们对中国人民的解放事业，都有一定的贡献。
    对于这批人，我们应当按照中央指示所提出的：“不但在和平建设中应该很好地依靠和使用他们，而且在国家一旦有事的时候更需要依靠他们作骨干，以便迅速壮大国防力量。”
    但有的同志，对复员军人缺乏正确的认识，没有看到他们的本质，而只是片面的强调复员军人“业务生疏”；甚至错误的认为复员军人“好提意见，不好领导”；因而有的单位对复员军人不是采取欢迎态度，而是把安置复员军人当做一个“包袱”，不注意对他们进行教育，不关心他们的生活，不主动热情地团结他们，甚至对他们加以歧视、打击或排斥。这些现象在每一地区、每一企业、每一工厂来说虽然是个别的，但是复员军人是几百万，如果集中起来数目也不小，有的很严重，必须注意纠正。
    复员军人中也有个别违法乱纪、无理取闹的，在人民群众中造成了不良影响。对这些人要特别加强管理教育，对情节严重的应作适当处理，对于违法的应依法惩办。这两方面都很重要：一方面教育他们，团结他们，把他们教育成为社会主义建设的积极因素；另方面，对个别坏分子，应该分别情节轻重，依法办理。这样作，才能分清是非，伸张正气。
    几年以来，复员、转业人员有五百多万人，加上今年复员的人员，全国将有六百万人员复员到农村、城市和各厂矿企业等单位，分布的面很广，存在的问题也不少。特别是随着义务兵役制度的实行，每年又将有一批义务兵由现役转入预备役。因而今后复员退伍的人员将是愈来愈多。为了做好这项工作，就要加强复员、退伍人员的管理教育，检查对他们的安置情况。虽然义务兵退伍后对他们的安置比起志愿兵较容易些，但也仍然有些问题要做适当的解决。这就说明复员、退伍将成为一项经常性的长期工作。因此，要求各级党委和政府经常地加强对这项工作的领导。最重要的是加强干部的思想领导，提高干部对复员工作的认识，纠正不正确的看法，并及时解决工作中发生的问题。如果不是这样作，而是把这项繁重的工作完全推到业务部门，是难以作好的。这是几年来的经验所证明了的。不仅复员工作是如此，其他关系到群众的工作也是一样，得不到党委的支持和领导是做不好的。
    复员军人绝大多数是来自农村，动员他们回到农村参加农业生产，这是完全正确的。因为就全国来说，最能够容纳人的地方是农村，容纳人最多的方面是农业。所以从事农业生产是今后安排复员军人的主要方面，也是他们今后就业的主要途径。但有一部分复员军人存在着不愿回农村，认为农村生活苦，回农村生产“没出息”等错误思想。对这一部分人应特别加强教育。既然我们能够动员他们参加军队，从事艰苦的战斗生活，不怕流血，不怕牺牲；当然我们也能够动员他们回到农村，积极参加农业生产。不论参加战斗也好，参加生产也好，总的目的都是为了人民的事业，祖国的事业。国家利益和他个人的利益是一致的，因此，我们能够说服他们。但他们离家较久，生产技术可能不够熟练，甚至在生活上也可能有些困难，如有的没有房子住，有的孤独无依等。这些问题在某些人看起来似乎不大，但对他们本人来说，都是大问题。因此，基层组织要经常注意帮助解决他们在生产、生活中的困难。这样对稳定他们的情绪，使他们安心农业生产是有很大作用的。此外，对复员军人在政治上、组织上也要适当的安置，尊重他们的政治荣誉。要教育干部和群众，应该像欢送他们参军一样地欢迎复员军人回到生产中来。参军的时候打锣敲鼓、骑马戴花，回去的时候也应该采取适当的方式表示欢迎，不要冷冷冰冰的。当复员军人回到农村的时候，可以举行适当会议表示欢迎，会上请复员军人谈一谈部队中学习和工作情况，请老复员军人和群众讲一讲安家和生产的经验，这对于作好安置工作，促进军民团结都有好处。还要吸收复员军人参加民兵，作为民兵中的骨干。
    最近中央指示：“农村基层干部中，应当有一部分是复员军人中的优秀分子，这对于作好农村工作和团结教育全体复员军人都有好处。各级党委应当把这作为一个重要政策来执行。”这是完全正确的。
    最后，军队方面对作好复员工作，同样负有重大的责任。加强复员军人的政治教育，提高他们的思想觉悟，是动员他们顺利回到生产中去的重要保证。这件工作，首先是要由军队来作的。军队在这方面，虽然作了许多工作，但是也存在着一些缺点。有些部队，教育尚未成熟就急于遣送，抱着推出了事的态度，这就给工作增加了困难。今后在军队方面，必须坚决执行“教育不成熟不走”的规定，切实作好对复员军人的思想教育工作。对复员军人的教育，必须是实事求是的。不要片面夸大复员后好的方面，缩小或隐蔽困难的方面。应当充分相信复员军人，经过适当地教育和动员，他们是能够愉快地回到生产中去的。事实证明，绝大多数复员军人都热烈地响应了党和政府的号召。军队方面对于复员军人的遣送工作，应当派出得力的干部率领，一直做到妥善地把复员军人交给地方接收为止。军区、军分区、各级兵役机关和工厂的军事代表，也应当在各级地方党委的统一领导下，主动地协助地方专业机关作好复员军人的安置和管理教育工作，把它列为自己的经常工作，反对那种袖手旁观的态度。总之，军队方面必须积极协助地方作好复员工作，这是增强军队与地方、军队与人民群众团结的重要工作之一。
    我们的任务是要把几百万复员军人的巨大力量组织起来，参加社会主义经济建设和国防后备力量的建设。虽然工作中还会有许多困难，但是在国家“统筹兼顾，适当安排”的方针下，依靠各级领导同志的努力和广大人民群众的支持，再加上军队方面的密切配合，这个重大的任务是可以胜利实现的。
