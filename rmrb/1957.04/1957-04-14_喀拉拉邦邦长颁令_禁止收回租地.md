Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 13th: The Governor of Kerala issued an ordinance in Trivandrum on April 11th, banning anyone from evicting tenants in the state.

    This ordinance applies to all types of landholders and occupants of huts who do not own the land beneath them.

    According to official explanations, this ordinance, which took immediate effect, is intended to prevent those who actually occupy the land from being disturbed before the government and legislature have time to study the land issue.

    The Communist-led Kerala government has stated that it intends to implement land reform to ensure that tillers own their land.
