    Kashgar Prefectural Committee of Xinjiang Emphasizes Implementing a Mutually Beneficial Policy

    Urumqi, April 27th (Reporter from this newspaper) - The Kashgar Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Xinjiang, at a recent enlarged meeting of its Standing Committee, focused on discussing the issue of correctly handling internal contradictions within agricultural cooperatives.

    During the past period of transferring to cooperatives and establishing cooperatives, many agricultural cooperatives in the Kashgar region, due to cadres' rigid work styles and unsound financial systems, or an overemphasis on the interests of the cooperatives during the transfer and merger of cooperatives, excessively low valuations of draught animals, and inappropriate methods for including orchards in the cooperatives, aroused considerable resentment among many members. Furthermore, the leadership of the higher-level Party committees was not thorough enough, and therefore failed to discover these problems in a timely manner and resolve them quickly. As a result, after the start of spring plowing, these contradictions within the agricultural cooperatives became apparent, and many members even demanded to withdraw from the cooperatives. At that time, the leadership did not clearly recognize these internal contradictions among the people and conduct thorough research to fundamentally resolve them. Instead, they resorted to the same old methods, generally emphasizing political and ideological education (which is of course necessary) and adopting a "treat the head when it aches, treat the foot when it hurts" approach, attempting to eliminate the contradictions and complete spring plowing production. Facts have proven that while this approach did solve some problems, it could not fundamentally reverse the situation in some cooperatives with more serious internal contradictions.

    In light of the above situation, the Prefectural Committee's Standing Committee meeting pointed out that the rural people's internal contradictions are mainly manifested in the internal contradictions within agricultural cooperatives. It demanded a thorough improvement in the relationship between the cooperatives and their members, and between the cooperative cadres and the masses, and the improvement of the democratic life of the cooperatives, in order to stimulate the enthusiasm and initiative of the cooperative members. The meeting believed that to correctly resolve internal contradictions within agricultural cooperatives, it is necessary to implement the policy of running cooperatives democratically, requiring all agricultural cooperatives to organize their cadres to study the three democratic measures for running cooperatives during production breaks, and to examine and resolve existing problems within the cooperatives.

    When studying how to overcome internal contradictions within agricultural cooperatives and further consolidate the cooperatives, the meeting placed particular emphasis on studying the implementation of mutually beneficial policies, believing that this is an important link in correctly adjusting the contradictions between the cooperatives and their members economically, and that the key to the current mutually beneficial policies is that in handling the remaining issues of production materials entering the cooperatives during the transfer and merger of cooperatives, the standards should be relaxed.

    The meeting believed that to correctly handle internal contradictions within agricultural cooperatives, only the working method of patient and meticulous persuasion and education can be adopted, and one must act in accordance with policies and resolutely overcome commandism and bureaucratic work styles.

    Maintaining a hard-working and simple lifestyle, and being approachable, are not only important conditions for deeply discovering problems for cadres working in rural areas, but also a symbol of implementing the instruction on correctly handling internal contradictions among the people in action. The meeting hoped that all cadres working in rural areas would improve their work and lifestyle from this perspective.

    调整社和社员的经济利益
    新疆喀什地委强调贯彻互利政策
    本报乌鲁木齐27日电　中共新疆喀什地委在最近召开的常委（扩大）会议上，着重讨论了关于正确处理农业社内部矛盾问题。
    在过去转社、办社期间，喀什地区不少农业社因为干部工作作风生硬、财务制度不健全，或转社并社中强调了社的利益、耕畜折价过低、果园入社的办法不妥，曾引起不少社员的反感；而上级党委的领导又不深入，因而没有能及时发现这些问题，迅速予以解决。结果，春耕开始后，这些农业社里的矛盾就表面化了，甚至有不少社员要求退社。当时，领导上并没有明确认识到这种人民内部的矛盾，很好地进行研究，从根本上求得解决；而是和过去一样，一般的强调一下政治思想教育（当然是必要的），采取“头痛医头，脚痛医脚”的办法，企图以此来消除矛盾、完成春耕生产。事实证明：这样作，虽然也解决了一些问题，但却不能从根本上扭转某些内部矛盾较严重的社的状况。
    这次地委常委会议，针对上述情况指出：农村人民内部矛盾，主要表现在农业社内部矛盾这一事实，要求彻底改善农业社里社与社员、社干部与社员群众之间的关系，健全社的民主生活，以激励社员群众的积极主动精神。会议认为：要正确解决农业社内部矛盾，必须贯彻民主办社方针，要求各农业社利用生产空隙，组织社干部学习民主办社三项措施，检查和解决社内存在的问题。
    会议在研究克服农业社内部矛盾，进一步巩固农业社问题时，特别重视研究贯彻互利政策问题，认为这是从经济上正确调整社和社员的矛盾的重要环节，而当前互利政策上的关键，是在处理转社并社中生产资料入社遗留问题时，应当放宽尺度。
    会议认为：要正确处理农业社内部矛盾，就只能采取耐心的细致的说服教育的工作方法，按照政策办事，必须坚决克服命令主义和官僚主义作风。
    在农村工作的干部，保持艰苦朴素的生活作风，平易近人，不仅是深入发现问题的一个重要条件，而且也是从行动上执行正确处理人民内部矛盾这一指示的标志。会议希望所有农村工作干部都从这个角度来改进自己的工作和生活作风。
