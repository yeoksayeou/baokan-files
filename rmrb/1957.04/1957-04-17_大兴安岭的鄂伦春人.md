    The Oroqen People of the Greater Khingan Range
    By Our Correspondent Miao Feng
    With a happy mood, I went to visit Ge Wancai, an Oroqen person from the Greater Khingan Range. He grabbed my hand suddenly, and I couldn't help but want to pull it back. I thought, what strength! Perhaps there was a spasm on my face, he quickly let go of my hand and blushed. He then weighed my hand and looked at his own hand, as if to say: a hunter's hand is used to competing with "blind bears" and "elk"!
    Ge Wancai is the director of the Greening Agricultural and Hunting Cooperative in Huma County, Heilongjiang Province. If the map of Heilongjiang Province looks like a swan stretching its long neck and sticking out its chest, their cooperative is located at the swan's eye. From Harbin, it takes two days by train, three days by car, and four days by sled. In summer, it takes even longer. I thought that it was already the hinterland of the Greater Khingan Range, with towering mountains and boundless primeval forests, where wild animals roamed and human habitation was sparse, truly desolate and dangerous. However, Ge Wancai told me with facts that at least half of my thoughts were wrong, and the correct half was already museum material.
    Before liberation, the Oroqen people had no villages, no fields; wherever they pitched their animal skin tents, that was their home. They used animal skins for bedding and clothing, and many utensils were also sewn from animal skins. Their main food was animal meat. There was no exploitation or oppression between people; besides a hunting gun, a few horses, and hunting dogs, they had no private property. Their cultural life consisted of holding hands and forming a circle after hunting animals, drinking, eating meat, singing, and dancing. Although there were no unified lyrics or steps, they were indeed happy. The same happy scene also appeared at the weddings of young men.
    Ge Wancai quickly took me into the forest with his not very fluent Chinese – how they men and women rode horses together to hunt, how their Kalamas and Ninakens (hunting dogs) always took light steps, lowered their heads, ran, and sniffed. In that sunless forest, at the slightest sound of birds flying and leaves falling, how they pricked up their ears, tilted their heads, and investigated. How did people judge what kind of wild animal it was from the shape and hardness of the animal's footprints in the snow? What time was it? Did it walk by leisurely? Or did it flee in panic? Did it go to the meadow? Or did it escape into the forest... How they hunted a lot of wild animals at once, and how they turned around for half a month or twenty days, climbed many mountains, and crossed many meadows, but only hunted a wild boar and a few weasels. There were satisfying gains, and there were also unexpected thrills.
    Once, they had just shot down a pregnant deer when they alarmed a blind bear the size of a calf. It stood at the entrance of a tree hole, propped open its seemingly still sleepy eyes with its front paws, and looked into the distance. Blind bears are naturally also the object of hunters' hunts. But everyone knows that it has the greatest strength among wild animals, and a paw can crush a person's head. Therefore, when hunting, it is necessary to hit its head accurately; if it does not hit the vital point, it will go crazy. But the blind bear is petty and cannot tolerate the slightest unsatisfactory thing, so hunters often use clever tricks to win.
    The hunters first released the clever and witty Kalamas and Ninakens to entangle with the blind bear. Experienced hunting dogs also always avoid fighting the blind bear head-on, often going around to bite the blind bear's buttocks. Just as the blind bear turned its head and raised its giant paw, its butt was bitten again... In this way, after the blind bear pounced empty several times, it would be out of breath with anger, desperately patting the ground with its front paws, and fiercely patting its own chest, seemingly demonstrating to the enemy: Come on! Come on!
    Who fired a shot, oh no, only injured the blind bear's leg. It suddenly pounced in the direction of the shot. Probably because it felt that the injured leg was too inconvenient, it bit it off and threw it aside. When it jumped on three legs, who fired another shot and tore open a piece of its belly, and its intestines slipped out of the wound. It grabbed some weeds to fill the wound and pounced forward again. Kalamas and Ninakens, whether because of the allure of blood or the eagerness to protect the hunter, darted out like arrows and bit the blind bear's butt, but with a slam from the blind bear, Kalamas and Ninakens rolled to a zhang away. But at this time, it felt the threat of being attacked from all sides, it barely stood up, and let out a huge retaliatory howl in all directions. At this time, it was shot in the head.
    This is how the Oroqen people risk their lives to obtain deer antlers, bear gallbladders, elk noses... and precious pelts.
    However, before liberation, the reactionary ruling class called them "savages." Those merchants with the dual character of wolves and foxes often used a bag of salt and water-diluted wine to swindle those valuable things. Some even adopted more despicable means, pretending to be "Anda" (making friends) with the Oroqen people, and after getting the honest "friends" drunk, they despicably robbed them of their things. During the period of Japanese occupation, a large amount of opium was transported into the forest, viciously trying to completely destroy this nation spiritually and physically.
    In the past years, officials, politicians, merchants, and bandits only knew to covet deer antlers, bear gallbladders, elk noses, and fluffy pelts, but did not care about or sympathize with the people who hunted these things. Take Ge Wancai, for example, he watched his father die in groans and his brother tossing and turning in the face of illness, but he did not see the trace of "Anda," nor did anyone send them even a sesame-sized medicine, until the patient closed his tearful eyes. Ge Wancai recalled the past, lowered his head for a long time, and said: "In the past, I never understood sadness. I thought that people in the world lived and died like the Oroqen people. Who knew it wasn't like that? I'm sad that my father, mother, and brother died too early. If they could see today..."
    After liberation, the Party and the government first helped the Oroqen people settle down and taught them how to farm. Let's talk about the Greening Agricultural and Hunting Cooperative, this forestry point of seventy-five households. It has established a supply and marketing cooperative, built elementary schools, health clinics, delivery stations, and barber shops. Recently, it will also build a bookstore. Members can see movies two or three times a year. After the establishment of the agricultural and hunting cooperative last year, due to the division of labor, the annual harvest surprised even the Oroqen people themselves. The hunting team hunted more than 2,200 deer, elk, bears, lynx, roe deer, wild boars, foxes, etc., and the agricultural team and sideline team had a total income of more than 51,700 yuan. Each workday is divided into 3.51 yuan, and a laborer can divide a maximum of 630 yuan and a minimum of 420 yuan.
    Ge Wancai said: "The Oroqen people have flown into socialism!"
    The Greening Agricultural and Hunting Cooperative is built on a flat meadow, surrounded by mountains with dense forests, and surrounded by rivers at the foot of the mountains. In summer, the mountains are full of wildflowers, truly with green mountains, clear waters, singing birds, and fragrant flowers. The agricultural team has already used harvesters, threshers, and grain cleaners. Every household lives in sturdy wooden houses with glass windows, sleeps on wooden beds, and is covered with mattresses and quilts; women have taken off their animal skins and put on floral clothes; a dozen young men are studying at the senior elementary school in Huma County. Some want to be engineers, some want to be tractor drivers, and some want to be movie actors...
    "These young men have big ambitions! But I have an idea." Ge Wancai said: "Our government advocates raising live animals. We must change our hunting methods and catch more live ones, and in the future, harvest more deer antlers and bear gallbladders from the zoo... and sell them to the state. I said to my girl Ge Xiuji who wants to be a movie actor, 'You should be a zookeeper in our zoo, and act out your own story in the movie.'" He laughed again as he spoke.
    Laugh, Oroqen people! From hunting and roaming to settling down, from animal skin tents to harvesters; from not understanding medicine to health clinics and delivery stations, from not knowing words to aspiring to be engineers... From primitive life to socialism. Oroqen people, how long a historical journey have you flown in a few years!
    At this time, someone was looking for Ge Wancai. He stretched out his thick, big hand to me. I held his tightly with both hands. He probably remembered the handshake when we first met and grinned. Four hands were held together for a long time. (Attached picture)

    大兴安岭的鄂伦春人
    本报记者　苗　风
    怀着愉快的心情，去拜访从大兴安岭下来的鄂伦春人戈万才。他猛一下握住我的手，我不由得想把手抽回来。心想，好大的劲儿呀。也许脸上痉挛了一下，他很快松开手，脸红了。他又掂掂我的手，看看自己的手，好像是说：猎人的手，是和“熊瞎子”“堪达犴”较量惯了的哟！
    戈万才是黑龙江省呼玛县绿化农、猎社主任。如果说，黑龙江省的版图像一只伸着长脖、挺着胸脯的天鹅，他们社正在天鹅的眼睛那里。从哈尔滨去，要坐两天火车，三天汽车，四天爬犁。在夏季需要的时间更长些。我想，那里已是大兴安岭的腹地，重重叠叠的高山峻岭，无边无沿的原始森林，野兽出没，人烟稀少，真够荒凉和险恶的了。但是，戈万才用事实告诉我，我的想法，最少有一半是错误的，而那正确的一半，也早已是历史博物馆的货色了。
    解放前，鄂伦春人没有村庄，没有田园，兽皮帐撑在哪里，哪里就是家。他们铺盖兽皮、穿戴兽皮，很多用具也是兽皮缝制的。主要的食物，是兽肉。人与人之间，没有剥削、没有压迫，除一只猎枪、几匹马和猎犬，他们再没有私有财产。他们的文化生活，就是在猎获到动物以后，手拉手围成一圈，喝酒吃肉，连唱带跳，尽管没有统一的唱词和步伐，但他们确是快活的。同样快活的情景，在青年小伙子的婚礼上，也还会出现。
    戈万才用不十分流利的汉语，很快把我带到了森林里——他们怎样男男女女一起骑马打猎，他们的卡拉玛、尼那肯（猎犬）总是迈着轻快的步子，低着头，跑一跑，闻一闻。在那不见阳光的森林里，有一点鸟飞树落叶的声音，它又怎么竖起耳朵，侧着脑袋，侦察起来。人们又怎样从雪地上野兽足迹的形状、硬度，判断是什么野兽？大约在什么时间？是逍遥自在地走过？还是惊慌失措地逃跑？是走向了草甸？还是逃窜到森林……他们怎样一次就猎获了很多野兽，他们又怎样转了半月二十天，爬了很多山，穿过很多草甸，而只打到了一只野猪和几只黄皮子。有称心如意的收获，也有意外的惊险。
    有一次，他们刚打倒一只胎鹿，却惊动了小牛一样大的熊瞎子。它站在树洞口，用前掌撑开好像还没睡醒的眼睛，向远处了望。熊瞎子自然也是猎人猎获的对象。但谁也了解，它在野兽里力量最大，一掌可以把人的脑袋击碎。所以猎获时，一定要打准它的头部，不打中要害，它就会疯狂起来。但熊瞎子气量狭小，不能容忍一点不如意的事情，所以猎人们常常用巧妙的计谋取胜。
    猎人们先放出聪明、机智的卡拉玛、尼那肯和熊瞎子纠缠。有经验的猎犬也总避免和熊瞎子正面作战，常常绕到后面去咬熊瞎子的屁股。熊瞎子刚调转头，举起巨掌的时候，屁股却又被咬了……就这样，熊瞎子扑空几次，就会气得上气不接下气，用前掌拼命拍地，又狠狠拍自己的胸膛，似乎在向敌人示威：来呀！来呀！
    是谁打了一枪，糟糕，只打伤了熊瞎子的一条腿，它忽地向打枪的方向扑来。大概它感到受伤的腿太不方便，就一口咬了下来扔到一旁。它用三条腿跳着扑来的时候，是谁又开了一枪，撕开它的一块肚皮，肠子从伤口滑出来。它抓些杂草填住伤口，又向前扑来。卡拉玛、尼那肯，不知是因为血腥的诱惑力，还是保护猎人的心切，箭一样地窜出去，咬住熊瞎子的屁股，可是，熊瞎子一摔，卡拉玛、尼那肯就滚到一丈远的地方了。但这时，它却感到四面受敌的威胁，它勉强站起来，向四面八方发出巨大的报复的嗥叫。这时，它头部中弹了。
    鄂伦春人就是这样冒着生命的危险获得鹿茸、熊胆、犴鼻……和宝贵的皮张的。
    但是，解放以前，反动的统治阶级称他们是“野人”。那些具有狼和狐狸双重性格的商人，常常用一包盐，掺了水的酒，讹诈去那些贵重的东西。还有的采用更加卑鄙的手段，假作同鄂伦春人做“安达”（交朋友），在把诚实的“朋友”灌醉以后，卑鄙地抢走他们的东西。日寇占领时期，更把大批的烟土运进森林，恶毒地要从精神上、肉体上彻底摧毁这个民族。
    已过去的岁月里，官僚、政客、商人、强盗，他们只知道对鹿茸、熊胆、犴鼻和毛茸茸的皮张垂涎三尺，却毫不关心和同情猎获这些东西的人。就说戈万才吧，他亲眼看着爸爸病死在呻吟声中，哥哥在病魔面前翻身打滚，却看不到“安达”的踪影，也没有人送给他们芝麻大的药品，一直到病人闭上含泪的眼睛。戈万才回忆起已往的情景，久久低着头，他说：“过去，我从不懂得难过，我以为世界上的人，都像鄂伦春人一样生活，一样死去，谁知道并不是这样，我难过，爸爸、妈妈、哥哥死得太早，他们要能看到今天……”
    解放后，党和政府首先帮助鄂伦春人定居下来，教他们种地，就说绿化农、猎社这个七十五户的林业点吧，设立了供销社，建立了小学校、卫生所、接生站、理发馆，最近又要盖书店。社员每年可以看到两三次电影。去年成立农猎社后，由于有了分工分业，一年的收获，连鄂伦春人自己也吃惊。狩猎队猎获了鹿、堪达犴、熊、猞猁、狍子、野猪、狐狸等二千二百多只，连同农业队、副业队共收入五万一千七百多元。每个劳动日分三元五角一，一个劳力最多分六百三十元，最少也分四百二十元。
    戈万才说：“鄂伦春人是飞进了社会主义啊！”
    绿化农、猎社建在一块平坦的草甸里，四周是山，山上森林密布，山下河水环绕，夏天满山遍野鲜花开，真是山青水秀，鸟语花香。农业队已使上了收割机、脱谷机、清粮机。家家户户都住上了结实的、安着玻璃窗户的木屋，睡上了木床，铺上了褥子、盖上了被；妇女们脱去了兽皮，换上了花衣服；十几个小伙子在呼玛县城高级小学读书，他们有的想当工程师，有的想当拖拉机手，还有的想当电影演员……。
    “这些小伙子们雄心不小啊！可是，我有个想法。”戈万才说：“咱政府提倡养活动物，我们一定要改变打猎的方法，多捉活的，将来从动物园里收获更多的鹿茸、熊胆……卖给国家。我和我那想当电影演员的丫头戈秀吉说，‘还是当咱动物园的饲养员吧，就在电影里演你自己的事情。’”说着他又笑起来了。
    笑吧，鄂伦春人！从游猎到定居，从兽皮帐到收割机；从不懂医药到卫生所、接生站，从不知文字到有志做工程师……从原始生活到社会主义。鄂伦春人，在几年里，飞过多长的历史路程啊！
    这时，有人找戈万才，他向我伸出了又粗又大的手，我用双手紧紧握住他，他大概想起了初见面时握手的情形，咧着大嘴笑了。四只手久久地握在一起。（附图片）
