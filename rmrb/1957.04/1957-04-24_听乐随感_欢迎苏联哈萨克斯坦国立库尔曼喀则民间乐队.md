	Impressions on Hearing Music
	——Welcoming the Soviet Kazakh State Kurmangazy Folk Orchestra

	The charming and distinctive sounds of the Soviet Kazakh State Kurmangazy Folk Orchestra have resonated in our capital.
	As we are increasingly concerned about the development of our country's folk orchestras and contemplating how the music and dance arts of various ethnic regions can be improved on the basis of tradition, the visit and performance in our country by this large folk orchestra with more than 20 years of history and more than 60 performers is invaluable to us. At the concert, I was not only moved by the beautiful music and the highly coordinated performance, but also increasingly felt that this is not just an orchestra, but also a living encyclopedia of folk instrumental ensemble art. It contains the rich artistic experience accumulated by Soviet artists over the past 20 years of creative labor. They have inherited the traditions of the past and opened up an unusually broad road.
	The more than 20-year history of the Kurmangazy Folk Orchestra is a history of the development from individual solo instruments to a large-scale modern folk orchestra with rich expressiveness, and also a history of the improvement of national musical instruments and the development of performance art. At the same time, the birth of this orchestra has directly stimulated the development of music creation in Kazakhstan from monophony and primitive two-part harmony to symphonic polyphony, and enabled many excellent musical works of various types in the world to be interestingly communicated through the performance of this expressive folk orchestra.
	Twenty-three years ago, the Kazakh dombra, as it had been passed down from generation to generation, was played solo. The tents of nomadic herdsmen were the stage for dombra players, and its not-so-loud string sounds could only be heard ten to twelve steps outside the tent. This situation rarely changed for centuries (perhaps dozens of centuries). However, the changes brought about by the great October Revolution were enormous. The Kazakh people, freed from political and economic oppression and bondage, traversed in just over 20 years a path that had not been reached in previous centuries while building a new culture with national form and socialist content. The improvement of national musical instruments and the establishment of ensemble art have given the entire nation's music a brand-new look. In less than ten years since its establishment, the Kurmangazy Folk Orchestra has done tremendous, real, and culturally historically significant work in improving musical instruments. The dombra has developed from one type into a family of four types of ensemble instruments. The frets originally tied with cow tendons have been changed to fixed ones, and the temperament has also been changed from natural temperament to equal temperament. The original two-stringed bowed instrument, the kobyz, had its two horsehair strings replaced by three strings of cow tendons and metal, and it was also developed into a family of four types, with better timbre and a much larger range.
	From these countless examples, combined with the development of Chinese musical instruments, one cannot help but recall the concrete examples of the quantitative and qualitative changes that Chinese musical instruments have given us in history. After the Song Dynasty, in order to meet the requirements of the development of opera music, the jinghu and banhu with distinctly different timbres were produced on the basis of the huqin; the Henan zhuiqin was also produced on the basis of the sanxian, which has very different timbre and playing techniques, due to the development of storytelling music. These facts show that while maintaining and carrying forward the characteristics of the original instruments, we should also be prepared to welcome the arrival of sudden changes at any time under the actual requirements of musical development. This is not surprising. At present, when considering the improvement and development of our national and folk musical instruments, I feel that we are still relatively lacking in such ideological preparation. Mentioning the dombra above, we may as well talk about the musical development of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Since the Han and Tang dynasties, Uygur music has had a special influence on Han music, and it is still unabated. This is a good thing. But at the same time, what is worrying is that Uygur music has been stagnant for a long time, and there is little improvement. The Uygur music I heard many years ago and the Uygur music I recently heard at folk performances are roughly the same, and I don't feel anything new. This cannot but make people feel the preciousness of the Soviet Kazakh artists' spirit of forging ahead bravely and reforming boldly. When appreciating the performance of the Kurmangazy Folk Orchestra, emphasizing the study of their spirit and experience in reforming musical instruments is of great significance.
	Of course, the improvement of musical instruments is inseparable from the purpose of developing folk orchestras. The purpose of the Kurmangazy Folk Orchestra in reforming musical instruments is mainly to meet the needs of establishing a large-scale modern folk orchestra with diverse and rich expressiveness. In order to achieve wide range, harmonious sound, and tonal coordination, only by reforming in the current way can the orchestra's current exquisite configuration requirements be met. If it is for another purpose or to meet the needs of another type of folk orchestra, I believe that other reform methods may be produced.
	Based on the situation in our country, while developing various types of folk orchestras, it is very necessary to consider establishing some large-scale modern folk orchestras like the Kurmangazy Folk Orchestra. In this regard, the Kurmangazy Folk Orchestra's valuable experience in improving musical instruments, studying the technical and sound characteristics of folk musical instruments, studying the composition of the orchestra, training performers, improving ensemble skills, expanding artistic expression, accumulating repertoire, and developing national music creation has great significance for us.

    听乐随感
    ——欢迎苏联哈萨克斯坦国立库尔曼喀则民间乐队
    叶林
    苏联哈萨克斯坦国立库尔曼喀则民间乐队的魅人而富于特性的琴音，已经在我们的首都响起来了。
    正当我们正在日益迫切地关心着我国民间乐队的发展、思索着各民族地区的音乐舞蹈艺术如何在传统的基础上提高的时候，这个已经具有二十多年历史、拥有六十多位演奏员的大型民间乐队来我国的访问演出，用不着说对我们是多么宝贵。在演奏会上，使我感到激动的不仅是由于那美妙的音乐和那高度协调的演奏，而且还由于越来越觉得这不单是一个乐队，同时还是一部有关民间器乐合奏艺术的活的百科全书。这里面有着由于苏联艺术家们二十多年来创造性的劳动而积累起来的丰富的艺术经验，他们继承了过去的传统，并且开拓了一条异常宽阔的道路。
    库尔曼喀则民间乐队二十多年来的历史，是一部从个别独奏乐器发展为表现力丰富的大型现代化民间乐队的历史，也是一部民族乐器改良和演奏艺术发展的历史。同时，由于这个乐队的诞生，还直接刺激了哈萨克斯坦从单声部和原始的双声部到交响乐的多声部的音乐创作的发展，并且使世界上许多优秀的各种类型的音乐作品能够有趣地通过这个表现力丰富的民间乐队的演出而得到交流。
    二十三年前，哈萨克的东不拉琴正如世世代代相传的那样，都是单独演奏的，草原游牧者的帐篷就是东不拉演奏者的舞台，它那不太响亮的弦声，只能传到帐幕外十到十二步之远。几个世纪（也许是几十个世纪）以来，这种情况很少改变。但是，伟大的十月革命所带来的变革是巨大的，摆脱了政治和经济上的压迫与束缚的哈萨克人民在建设自己民族形式和具有社会主义内容的新文化的时候，仅仅在二十几年中就走过了从前几个世纪所没有走到的道路，民族乐器的改良与合奏艺术的建立使整个民族的音乐都出现了崭新的面貌。库尔曼喀则民间乐队成立不到十年，在改良乐器方面就做出了巨大的、真正的、具有文化历史意义的工作。东不拉琴从一种类型发展成为一族具有四种类型的合奏乐器，过去用牛筋扎上的品（相）已经改为固定的，音律也从自然律而改为十二平均律了。过去那原始的两根弦的弓弦乐器科比兹琴，它的两根马尾弦也被牛筋及金属的三根弦所代替，并且也发展成为一族的四种类型，有着更好的音色和大得多的音域。
    从这些举不胜举的例子中，联系到我们中国的乐器发展状况，不禁也使人想起了中国乐器的量变和质变在历史上所曾给予我们的具体实例。宋代以后，适应着戏曲音乐发展的要求，在胡琴的基础上曾产生了音色截然不同的京胡与板胡；河南坠子琴也是由于说唱音乐的发展而从音色与演奏技术都很不相同的三弦的基础上产生的。这些事实说明：在保持与发扬原有乐器特点的同时，在音乐发展的实际要求之下，也应该随时准备迎接突变的到来。这是不足为怪的。目前，在考虑改良与发展我们的民族、民间乐器的时候，我觉得我们还比较缺乏这样的思想准备。上面提起东不拉琴，我们不妨再谈谈新疆维吾尔自治区的音乐发展状况。维吾尔族的音乐自汉唐以来就对汉民族的音乐有着特殊的影响，至今仍不衰歇。这是好的一面。但使人又同时感到耽虑的是维吾尔族的音乐长时期以来有陷于停顿的现象，很少改进。许多年以前听维吾尔族的音乐和最近在民间会演上听到的维吾尔族音乐，大致上相同，感觉不到有甚么新鲜的东西。这就不能不使人感到苏联哈萨克斯坦艺术家们勇敢直前、大胆改革的精神的可贵。在欣赏库尔曼喀则民间乐队演奏的时候，强调学习他们改革乐器的精神和经验，是有重要的意义的。
    当然，改良乐器是和发展民间乐队的目的性是分不开的。库尔曼喀则民间乐队改革乐器的目的，主要是为了适应建立一个大型的表现力多样而丰富的现代化民间乐队的需要。为了音域的宽广、音响的和谐与音色的调协，只有按目前这样的改革方法，才能够达到乐队目前这种绝妙的配置的要求。如果是为了另一种目的或是为了适应另一种类型的民间乐队的需要，我相信又可能会产生其它的改革方法。
    根据我们国家的状况，在发展各种类型民间乐队的同时，考虑建立一些像库尔曼喀则民间乐队那样的大型现代化民间乐队，是十分必要的。在这方面，库尔曼喀则民间乐队在改良乐器、研究民间乐器技术上和声音上的特性，研究乐队的编成，训练演奏员，提高合奏技巧，扩大艺术表现力、积累保留节目、发展民族音乐创作事业等等方面的宝贵经验，对我们就有着重大的意义。
