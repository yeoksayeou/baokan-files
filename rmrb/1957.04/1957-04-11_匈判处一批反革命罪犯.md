Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, April 10th: The Budapest City Court sentenced twelve counter-revolutionary criminals on the 8th. Among them, Tóth Ilona (female), Gönczi, and Gránc were sentenced to death, while the other nine were sentenced to imprisonment ranging from six months to ten years.

　　Most of these criminals participated in the counter-revolutionary riots of last October. Among them were doctors, journalists, writers, and university students. Their crimes included: killing workers, privately interrogating citizens, illegally publishing reactionary newspapers, printing and distributing counter-revolutionary leaflets, inciting strikes, and organizing the women's march in Budapest on December 4 last year. They consciously carried out various inflammatory propaganda activities against the worker-peasant revolutionary government, attempting to restore capitalism. In addition, they also engaged in robbery and illegal possession of weapons.
