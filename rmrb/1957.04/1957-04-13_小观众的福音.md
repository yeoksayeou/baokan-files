    Good News for Young Audiences
    The China Welfare Institute Children's Art Theatre was officially established in Shanghai on April 10th, and a founding meeting was held in the evening at the Yangtze Theatre.
    The predecessor of the Children's Art Theatre was the "China Welfare Institute Children's Troupe," founded by Ms. Soong Ching Ling in Shanghai in 1947. In the years since liberation, with the care of the Party and the People's Government, it has grown rapidly in all aspects. Over the past ten years, this troupe has performed dramas, music, and dances in Beijing, Shanghai, and Korea, totaling 864 performances, receiving 1,210,000 audience members.
    The newly established Children's Art Theatre will now specialize in performing dramas, fairy tales, and musical dramas suitable for the psychology of young people. The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture has decided to use the Shanghai Yan'an Cinema as the theatre's main venue, providing it with a place to regularly perform excellent plays for young people.
    At the founding meeting on the evening of the 10th, the Secretary-General of the China Welfare Institute read out Ms. Soong Ching Ling's congratulatory letter to the Children's Art Theatre. Responsible individuals from the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and other departments delivered speeches, expressing congratulations on the establishment of the Children's Art Theatre. They also called on the Shanghai literary and art circles to create more works for children. Lu Dingyi, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Wei Wenbo, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and writer Ba Jin were also invited to attend the meeting.
    After the meeting, the theatre performed the song and dance fairy tale "Sea Stone Flower."

    小观众的福音
    中国福利会儿童艺术剧院，已于4月10日在上海正式成立，并于晚上在长江剧场举行了建院大会。
    儿童艺术剧院的前身是“中国福利会儿童剧团”，系宋庆龄先生于1947年在上海创办的。解放后几年来，它在党和人民政府的关怀下，各方面都成长得很快。十年来，这个剧团曾在北京、上海和朝鲜等地，演出戏剧、音乐和舞蹈达八百六十四场，接待了观众一百二十一万人。
    新成立的儿童艺术剧院今后将专门演出适合青少年心理的话剧、童话剧和音乐话剧。上海市文化局已决定将上海延安电影院作为剧院的基本剧场，供它经常向青少年们演出优秀的剧目。
    在10日晚上的建院大会上，中国福利会秘书长宣读了宋庆龄先生给儿童艺术剧院的祝贺信。上海市人民委员会、中共上海市委等部门的负责人都讲了话，对儿童艺术剧院的建立表示庆贺。并号召上海文艺界多为儿童们创作。中共中央宣传部部长陆定一、中共上海市委书记处书记魏文伯、作家巴金等也都应邀参加了这个大会。
    会后，剧院演出了歌舞童话剧“海石花”。　（施）
