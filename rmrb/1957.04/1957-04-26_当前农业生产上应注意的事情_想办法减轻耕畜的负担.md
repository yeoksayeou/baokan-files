Matters to be Noted in Current Agricultural Production
    Find Ways to Reduce the Burden on Draught Animals

During the intense spring plowing season, the emaciation and abnormal deaths of livestock can easily occur. In areas where draught animals are scarce, the burden on each animal is even heavier, exacerbating the situation.

Is there a solution to this problem? Some people believe that it is inevitable for livestock to recover slowly and for abnormal deaths to occur during busy farming periods. This view is incorrect. In Gao Ling County, Shaanxi Province, attention was paid to finding solutions to this problem during spring plowing. The health of the draught animals not only did not deteriorate but improved, and abnormal deaths were basically eliminated. Was the condition of livestock in Gao Ling County originally better? No, it wasn't. Last year, the county lost more than 1,100 head of livestock, accounting for approximately 10.85% of the total livestock population, and emaciation was widespread. Like other counties in Guanzhong, Gao Ling County launched a campaign to cherish and protect livestock last winter. Leaders and cadres went deep into the rural areas to conduct inspections from commune to commune and stall to stall. They also held appraisal meetings, exchanged experiences in feeding and management, and rewarded agricultural cooperatives with good feeding and management practices. These efforts yielded significant results. However, emaciation and deaths continued.

Based on this situation, the leaders of Gao Ling County conducted further investigations in rural areas. It was found that a major reason for the continued emaciation and deaths was that the agricultural workload was increasing daily, and the problem of strained animal power had not been properly addressed. Emaciated livestock were carrying too heavy a workload, preventing them from recovering their strength. Some feeders reported that livestock would gain weight only to lose it again with the onset of busy farming. Some commune cadres reported that although "three guarantees" were implemented for livestock and work was rationally arranged according to their strength, these regulations were difficult to implement due to the heavy workload and limited animal power. This year, all arable land in Gao Ling County has been irrigated, making farming more detailed and requiring more livestock than in previous years. If this problem is not solved, the phenomenon of livestock deaths and emaciation may become more severe during the busy season.

How can this problem be solved? Buying more livestock is one option, but it presents difficulties. In the current situation where livestock are scarce everywhere, it is not easy to purchase large numbers of animals. Even if they could be purchased, a lack of funds would be a major issue.

Gao Ling County mobilized the masses to find solutions, and they finally resolved the problem. Last year, the "July 1st" Agricultural Cooperative in the county built a water mill, utilizing the "waterfall" of a canal. This water mill can grind 10,000 jin of grain per day, basically solving the members' problem of obtaining flour. Assuming each animal grinds 80 jin of grain per day (some cannot even grind 80 jin), this water mill frees up over 100 head of livestock to be used for agricultural production. This is the reason why the livestock situation in the "July 1st" Cooperative is relatively good. County leaders believe this is a good way to solve the problem of strained animal power. They have also surveyed all locations with "waterfalls" in the county and initially plan to build 52 water mills (some of which are small, grinding 700 to 800 jin of grain per day). This would free up several hundred livestock in the county for agricultural production, with a lower investment than buying livestock. The Chong Huang Agricultural Cooperative in Chong Huang Township of the county has the most strained livestock situation. The cooperative has over 600 mu of land but only 90 head of draught animals. Even after rationally arranging the workload, they still lack 40 head of livestock. The masses in the cooperative were very worried about the livestock problem. The feeders, in particular, had done their best in feeding work, but the emaciation of the livestock was still slow to improve. Experienced farmers reported that it wasn't even the busy season yet, and that it would be even more hectic during the summer harvest. After discussing with the members, it was found that the locals had a habit of using shovels to turn over cotton fields, which was also a good way to increase cotton production. Therefore, the masses were mobilized to use shovels to turn over the cotton fields and to transport manure and soil manually, replacing some of the animal power. They also planned to build a water mill that could grind 1,000 jin of grain per day. By adopting these measures, the livestock burden in the cooperative was reduced, and the feeders had more confidence in raising the livestock well. Currently, the emaciation of the livestock in the cooperative has greatly improved.

Gao Ling County used these methods to solve the problem of strained animal power, which greatly changed the livestock situation in the county. Not long ago, a general survey of the livestock situation in the county was conducted. There were more than 9,700 head of livestock. Livestock in the best condition numbered 2,992, accounting for over 30% of the total. Livestock in good condition numbered 4,859, accounting for over 50% of the total. Livestock in poor condition (including old and weak animals) numbered 1,850, less than 20% of the total, and livestock deaths have basically ceased.

Some places may not have the conditions to build water mills; however, there may be other ways to save animal power. To prevent draught animals from continuing to emaciate and die abnormally, it is essential to find ways to reduce the burden on animal power. Otherwise, the number of livestock will decrease, the strain will increase, and even greater difficulties will arise.

    当前农业生产上应注意的事情
    想办法减轻耕畜的负担
    在紧张的春耕生产中，牲畜的瘦弱和非正常死亡现象很容易发生。在耕畜缺乏的地区，每头耕畜的负担过多，情况就更加严重。
    这个问题有没有办法解决呢？有些人认为，农活紧张了，牲畜的健康恢复的慢是必然的，牲畜非正常死亡现象也是不可避免的。这种说法是不对的。陕西省高陵县在春耕生产中，注意了想办法解决这个问题，耕畜健康情况不但没有变坏，反而好转了，不正常死亡现象也基本上杜绝了。是不是高陵县的牲畜情况原来就比较好呢？不是的。去年这个县共死亡一千一百多条牲畜，约占全县牲畜总数的10.85％，牲畜瘦弱是普遍现象。这个县和关中各县一样，在去冬展开了爱畜保畜运动。领导人员和干部一起深入农村，逐社逐槽进行检查，并且还举办了评比大会，交流了饲养管理的经验，奖励了饲养管理工作好的农业社。这些工作都有很大成绩。但是，牲畜瘦弱现象仍然存在，死亡现象也仍不断地发生。
    根据这种情况，高陵县领导人员又深入农村进行调查。据了解，牲畜继续瘦弱和继续死亡的一个主要原因，是因为农业生产的活路一天比一天加重了，畜力紧张问题没有很好地解决，瘦弱的牲畜担负了过重的工作，使体力不能很好恢复。有些饲养员这样反映：牲畜刚喂养的上膘了，农活一紧张就又瘦了。有些社干部反映：牲畜虽然实行了“三包”，并根据牲畜强弱，合理的安排了活路，但是，由于农活重，畜力少，这些规定实行起来有很多困难。今年高陵县的耕地已全部实行了灌溉，农活更加细致，所需牲畜也比往年更多。这个问题解决不好，在农忙的季节中，牲畜死亡瘦弱的现象可能发展的更严重。
    怎样解决这个问题呢？再买一些牲畜是一个办法，但是有困难。在目前各地都缺乏牲畜的情况下，大批的牲畜不易购买得到，即使能够买到，缺乏资金也是一个很大的问题。
    高陵县发动群众想办法，终于解决了这个问题。这个县的“七一”农业社去年修建了一座水磨，这是利用水渠的“跌水”修建的。这座水磨一天可以磨一万斤粮食，基本上解决了社员吃面的问题。按每条牲畜一天磨八十斤粮食来计算（有的牲畜一天还磨不了八十斤粮食），有了这座水磨，可以腾出一百多条牲畜来投到农业生产上去。“七一”社的牲畜情况较好的原因就在这里。县领导上认为，这是解决畜力紧张问题的一个好办法。他们并对全县有“跌水”的地方都进行了调查，初步计划修建五十二座水磨（其中有些是小型的水磨，一天可磨七百到八百斤粮食），这样全县就可以腾出几百头牲畜，专门用来从事农业生产，而且比买牲畜的投资要少很多。这个县的崇皇寺乡崇皇农业社是全县牲畜最紧张的一个农业社，全社共有六百多亩地，而耕畜只有九十头。经过合理安排活路之后，全社还缺牲畜四十头。该社群众都为牲畜问题发愁。特别是饲养人员，他们确实在饲养工作上尽了最大的努力，但是，牲畜瘦弱的情况却还是改变得很慢。有经验的农民反映：现在还不算忙，等到夏收时更会忙得不得了。经过同社员群众商量之后，发现这里的群众有用铁锨翻棉花地的习惯，并且还是棉花增产的一个好办法；于是，就发动群众用铁锨翻棉田，用人力送粪、推土，来代替一部分畜力，并计划修建一座每天能磨一千斤粮食的水磨。采用这些办法，这个社的畜力负担减轻了，饲养员对饲养好牲畜也有了信心。目前，这个社牲畜瘦弱的情况已有很大的改变。
    高陵县就是用这些办法解决了畜力紧张的问题，使全县的牲畜情况起了很大的变化。不久以前，对全县的牲畜情况普遍地进行了一次调查。全县共有九千七百多头牲畜。头等膘的牲畜有二千九百九十二头，约占牲畜总数的30％以上；二等膘的牲畜共有四千八百五十九头，约占总数的50％以上；三等膘的牲畜（包括老弱牲畜在内）共有一千八百五十头，还不到牲畜总数的20％，牲畜的死亡现象已基本停止了。
    有些地方可能没有修水磨的条件；但是，可能有另外的节省畜力的办法。要使耕畜不继续瘦弱和非正常死亡，就一定要想办法减轻畜力负担。不然，就会使畜力越来越少，越来越紧张，造成更大的困难。
