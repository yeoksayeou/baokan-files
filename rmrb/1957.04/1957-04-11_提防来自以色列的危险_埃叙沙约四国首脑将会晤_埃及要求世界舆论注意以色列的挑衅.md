Xinhua News Agency, April 10th dispatch from Amman: The Jordanian Royal Palace issued a statement on April 9th saying that Egyptian President Nasser, Saudi Arabian King Saud, and Syrian President Kuwatli have accepted Jordanian King Hussein's invitation to hold a four-nation summit.
    The statement did not announce the date of the four-nation summit.
    According to reports, Hussein, in his letters to the heads of the three countries, strongly advocated four-nation cooperation "to fight against propaganda that violates Arab traditions, religions, and principles." Hussein also asked to beware of the danger from Israel, saying that Israel is protected by foreign imperialism.
    Shortly before the Royal Palace issued this statement, the Jordanian cabinet held an all-night emergency meeting. Also attending the meeting were Jordanian Army Chief of Staff Nower and Jordanian Ambassador to Egypt, Mulqi. Sources said the meeting discussed important domestic issues.
    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, April 10th: An Egyptian official spokesman on the 9th called on world opinion to pay attention to the incidents of Israeli patrols attacking and kidnapping Arabs in the ceasefire demarcation zone and Israeli aircraft invading the airspace over the Gaza Strip.
    The Director of the Information Bureau, Hatem, said that these provocative and aggressive actions, which continue despite the presence of the United Nations Emergency Force, "aim only to defy the United Nations and play with the peace and security of the region."
    When talking about Israel's insistence that the Egyptian side was carrying out infiltration activities, Hatem said: It is significant that, until now, Israel has not lodged any protests with the Mixed Armistice Commission, or even requested an investigation. This shows that Israel is "trying to create a smokescreen to cover up a planned aggression."

    提防来自以色列的危险
    埃叙沙约四国首脑将会晤
    埃及要求世界舆论注意以色列的挑衅
    据新华社10日讯　安曼消息：约旦王宫4月9日发表声明说，埃及总统纳赛尔、沙特阿拉伯国王沙特和叙利亚总统库阿特利已经接受了约旦国王侯赛因关于举行四国首脑会议的邀请。
    声明没有宣布四国首脑会议的日期。
    据消息报道，侯赛因在给三国首脑的信中竭力主张四国合作“和那些违反阿拉伯传统、宗教和原则的宣传作斗争”。侯赛因还在信中要求提防来自以色列的危险，他说，以色列是受外国帝国主义保护的。
    在王宫发表这项声明前不久，约旦内阁举行了通宵的紧急会议。参加会议的还有约旦陆军总参谋长诺瓦尔和约旦驻埃及大使穆尔基。消息说，会议讨论了重要的国内问题。
    新华社开罗10日电　埃及官方发言人9日提请世界舆论注意以色列巡逻部队在停火分界线一带袭击和绑架阿拉伯人以及以色列飞机侵入加沙地带上空的事件。
    新闻局局长哈特姆说，这些不顾联合国紧急部队在那里驻扎而仍然进行的挑衅和侵略行动，“目的只是要藐视联合国和以这个地区的和平和安全为儿戏”。
    哈特姆在谈到以色列硬说埃及方面在进行渗透活动的时候说：意味深长的是，到现在为止，以色列没有向混合停战委员会提出任何抗议，甚至没有要求进行调查。这表明，以色列正在“设法制造一种烟幕，以便掩饰正在策划的侵略”。
