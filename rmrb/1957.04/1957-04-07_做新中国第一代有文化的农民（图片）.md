Becoming the First Generation of Cultured Farmers in New China

Since 1954, 34 graduates of senior elementary schools and 3 graduates of junior middle schools in the Houtai Township Peace First Cooperative of Ju County, Henan Province, have participated in agricultural production. Whether during plowing or harvesting seasons, they work alongside the veteran farmers. Many have excelled in production labor and have been praised by the masses. Ou Zhizhen, a senior elementary school graduate currently serving as the head of the Second Cooperative, is one such example. She not only undertakes the cooperative's leadership work but also insists on participating in field labor with the cooperative members.

They are also diligent in their cultural life and learning of production knowledge. The cooperative's library and theater troupe have become centers for youth group activities. All elementary school graduates have joined the amateur middle school run by the cooperative, and junior middle school graduates serve as cultural instructors.

In nearly three months, more than 3,700 large carts of pit mud have been dug. Elementary school graduates are actively participating in the work of digging pit mud.

Senior elementary school graduate Ji Junzhou (left), in addition to actively participating in production, also serves as the scorekeeper for the production team. Here he is sorting out accounts and counting work point tickets with the production team's accountant.

Senior elementary school graduate and agricultural technician Yang Qingyun (center), experienced veteran farmer Zhang Shaokong, and technician Li Fatian from the county agricultural guidance station are observing the thermometer used for sweet potato warm bed seedling cultivation.

Senior elementary school graduates, like veteran farmers, do not let go of harmful birds that damage crops.

The cooperative's amateur theater troupe is very active. Cooperative members can often see performances by the theater troupe. Here, senior elementary school graduates Hao Qingquan and Hao Qingxiu are performing "Chasing the Boat."

Female cooperative member Han Yumei (right) is a rural working woman who, after several years of hard study, has achieved excellent results and is now a teacher in the junior class of the night school. Here she is selecting cotton seeds with labor model Ou Zhizhen.

Li Jizhen (left), a senior elementary school graduate, was not very willing to participate in production after graduating in 1956, but she changed her attitude with the help of the Communist Youth League organization. Now she not only actively participates in production but also works as a teacher in the night school and actively strives to join the League. Here she is talking to Zhang Qinglan, the League's women's committee member, about her ideological struggle.

Each production team of the Peace First Cooperative has already begun weeding the winter wheat fields for the first time. This weeding team includes not only experienced veteran farmers but also some senior elementary school and junior middle school graduates.

Ren Zhanli, the cooperative's accountant, returned to his hometown to participate in agricultural production after graduating from Ju County Middle School in 1955. He is conscientious and responsible in his work and has never made a mistake.

    做新中国第一代有文化的农民
    河南雎县厚台乡和平一社，从1954年以来，有三十四名高小毕业生和三名初中毕业生参加农业生产。不论在耕作或者是在收获的季节里，他们都是同老农们并肩劳动着。许多人的生产劳动非常出色，受到群众的赞扬。现在担任第二社长的高小毕业生欧志真，就是其中的一个。她不仅担负着社里的领导工作，而且坚持同社员一起参加田间劳动。
    他们在文化生活和生产知识的学习方面也很努力。社里的图书馆和剧团，成为青年人集体活动的中心。小学毕业生全部参加了社里办的业余中学学习，初中毕业生则担任文化教员。　本报记者　刘长忠摄
    左上图：和平一社为了争取今年大丰收，大力开展积肥运动。在近三个月内，光坑泥就挖了三千七百多大车。小学毕业生都积极地参加了挖坑泥的工作。
    上图：和平一社的几个高小毕业生：（从左至右）张志强、欧志真、任占春和任秀存。
    高小毕业生姬君周（左），除积极参加生产外，还担任了生产队的记分员。这是他和生产队的会计在整理账目和清点工分票。
    高小毕业生、农业技术员杨清云（中）和有经验的老农张绍孔同县农业指导站技术员李法田，正在观察红薯温床育苗所用的温度计。
    高小毕业生和老农一样，并没有放过损害农作物的害鸟。
    社里的业余剧团非常活跃。社员们能够经常看到剧团演出的节目。这是高小毕业生郝清泉和郝清秀等在表演“赶船”。
    女社员韩玉美（右）是一个农村的劳动妇女，经过几年的苦学，取得了优良的成绩，目前她已成为夜校初级班的教员了。这是她和劳动模范欧志真在选择棉籽的情形。
    高小毕业生李继真（左）1956年毕业以后，还不大乐意参加生产，后经团组织的帮助有了转变。现在她不仅积极生产，还当了夜校的教师，并积极争取入团。这是她和团的妇女委员张庆兰谈她思想斗争的回忆。
    和平一社各生产队已经开始在冬麦地里除头次草了。这个除草小队不仅有经验丰富的老农，还有一些高小和初中毕业学生参加。
    社部会计任占礼，1955年在雎县中学毕业后就回乡参加了农业生产。他对工作认真负责，从来没有出过差错。
