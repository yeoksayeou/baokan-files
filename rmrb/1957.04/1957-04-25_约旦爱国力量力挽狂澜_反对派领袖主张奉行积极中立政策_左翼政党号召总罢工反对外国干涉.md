    Jordanian Patriotic Forces Try to Save the Situation
    Opposition Leader Advocates a Policy of Active Neutrality
    Left-Wing Party Calls for General Strike Against Foreign Interference
    (Reported by this newspaper) Amman dispatch: The broad masses of the Jordanian people and patriotic political forces are making active efforts to resolve the current political crisis in Jordan. According to a United Press International dispatch, Jordanian opposition leaders formed a delegation on the 23rd and submitted a petition to Prime Minister of the Cabinet, al-Khalidi. This petition was adopted on the 22nd at a mass meeting held by the Jordanian National Guidance Committee in Nablus. According to a broadcast by Cairo Radio, the committee presented fourteen demands to al-Khalidi, including rejecting the Eisenhower Doctrine, realizing an alliance between Jordan, Syria, and Egypt, pursuing a policy of active neutrality, purging imperialist agents, forming a government of national unity, disbanding the military investigation committee, and recalling the American ambassador and his military attaché, etc.
    On the 23rd, mass demonstrations and parades took place in four Jordanian cities—Nablus, Jerusalem, Jericho, and Ramallah—with demonstrators shouting slogans against imperialism. The demonstrating masses also demanded a boycott of the activities of U.S. President's special envoy Richards, rejection of the "Eisenhower Doctrine," and restoration of the positions of officers who had been purged from the Jordanian army. According to an Associated Press report, the Jordanian left-wing party has called for a general strike on the 24th to oppose imperialist interference.
    Former Jordanian Prime Minister and current Foreign Minister Nabsi said in a statement to reporters on the 23rd: "We will never compromise with imperialism, which is attempting to make a comeback." According to Reuters, Interior Minister Mufti hopes to resign because he is unwilling to be responsible for "police actions" that may be taken against the people.
    Meanwhile, Jordanian Prime Minister al-Khalidi convened an emergency cabinet meeting on the evening of the 23rd. According to Reuters, Egyptian Deputy Foreign Minister Youssef, who arrived in Amman on the 23rd, attended the meeting. Subsequently, al-Khalidi held discussions with Jordanian King Hussein. It is said that al-Khalidi has not yet made a decision on the issue of resignation. He may ask Parliament to hold a vote of confidence next week, it is reported. In a conversation with a CBS reporter, al-Khalidi said that in the current atmosphere of high anti-imperialist sentiment among the Jordanian people, a visit to Jordan by U.S. President's special envoy Richards would be "unwise."
    (Reported by this newspaper) According to a United Press International dispatch on the 23rd, Cairo newspapers generally believe that the Jordanian crisis is a conspiracy supported by the United States to put Jordan on the "Eisenhower Doctrine" track. The Egyptian "Evening News," commenting on U.S. Secretary of State Dulles's remarks on the Middle East situation on the 22nd, pointed out that "in reality, what Mr. Dulles hopes for is a situation in which the Middle East is subjected to U.S. enslavement due to U.S. interference in the internal affairs of Arab countries and attempts to subvert Jordanian democratic organizations against the will of the Jordanian people." The Egyptian "People's News" also pointed out that the obvious aim of the imperialist conspiracy to interfere in Jordan is to undermine Jordan's neutrality, rebuild foreign rule, and use its territory as a military base for aggression.
    (Reported by this newspaper) U.S. Secretary of State Dulles said at a press conference on the 23rd, regarding the political crisis in Jordan, that the United States hopes to "support King Hussein in the Jordanian political situation so that he believes we can be of help." On the same day, U.S. Democratic Senator Fulbright told reporters that "if Jordan is attacked by Syria, the United States may be drawn into a war as a result of defending Jordan." According to him, under the "Eisenhower Doctrine," if the U.S. President "judges that Syria is ruled by communists," the United States "may" use this as an excuse to take military intervention measures in Jordan's internal affairs.

    约旦爱国力量力挽狂澜
    反对派领袖主张奉行积极中立政策
    左翼政党号召总罢工反对外国干涉
    本报讯　安曼消息：约旦广大人民和爱国的政治力量正在为解决目前约旦的政治危机进行着积极的努力。据合众社讯，约旦反对派领袖们23日组成一个代表团向内阁首相哈利迪提出了一份请愿书，这份请愿书是22日约旦全国指导委员会在纳布鲁斯举行的群众大会上所通过的。据开罗电台广播，委员会向哈利迪提出了十四项要求，其中包括拒绝艾森豪威尔主义，实现约旦、叙利亚、埃及之间的联盟，奉行积极中立的政策，清洗帝国主义代理人，成立一个举国一致的政府，解散军事调查委员会，撤回美国大使和他的武官等。
    23日，约旦的四个城市——纳布鲁斯、耶路撒冷、杰里科和拉马拉——发生了群众的游行示威，示威者高呼反对帝国主义的口号。示威群众还要求抵制美国总统特使理查兹的活动，拒绝“艾森豪威尔主义”，并恢复被清洗出约旦军队的军官们的职务。另据美联社消息，约旦左翼政党已号召在24日举行总罢工，以反对帝国主义的干涉。
    约旦前首相、现任外交大臣纳布西23日在向记者发表谈话时说：“我们决不同企图卷土重来的帝国主义妥协。”据路透社报道说，内政大臣穆弗蒂希望辞职，因为他不愿对可能对人民采取的“警察行动”负责。
    同时，约旦首相哈利迪于23日晚召开了一次紧急的内阁会议，据路透社讯，23日到达安曼的埃及外交部次长优素福出席了这次会议。随后哈利迪又同约旦国王侯赛因进行了商谈。据说，哈利迪还没有就辞职问题作出决定。有消息说，他可能将在下星期要求议会举行信任投票。哈利迪在对哥伦比亚广播公司记者谈话中说，目前在约旦人民反对帝国主义的情绪高涨的气氛之下，美国总统特使理查兹访问约旦将是“不明智的”。
    本报讯　据合众社23日消息，开罗报纸普遍认为，约旦危机是美国支持的企图使约旦走上“艾森豪威尔主义”轨道的一个阴谋。埃及“晚报”在评论美国国务卿杜勒斯22日关于中东形势的谈话时指出，“实际上，杜勒斯先生所希望的情况，是能够使得中东由于美国干涉阿拉伯国家的内政和企图违反约旦人民的意志来推翻约旦的民主组织而受美国奴役的情况。”埃及“人民报”也指出，帝国主义企图干涉约旦的阴谋的明显的目的是要破坏约旦的中立、重建外国统治，并且利用它的领土作为侵略的军事基地。
    本报讯　美国国务卿杜勒斯23日在记者招待会上就约旦的政治危机问题发表谈话说，美国希望在约旦政局中“支持国王侯赛因，使他认为我们是可以有所帮助的”。同一天美国民主党参议员富布赖特对记者说，“如果约旦遭到叙利亚的攻击，美国由于保卫约旦而可能被卷入一场战争。”据他说，根据“艾森豪威尔主义”，如果美国总统“判断叙利亚是受共产党统治的话”，美国就“可能”以此为借口对约旦内政采取武力干涉的手段。
