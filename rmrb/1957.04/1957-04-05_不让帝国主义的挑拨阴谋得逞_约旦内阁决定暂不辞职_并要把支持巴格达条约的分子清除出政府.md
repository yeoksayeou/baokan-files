Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, April 4th: According to the Middle East News Agency, the cabinet of Jordanian Prime Minister Nabulsi announced on the evening of the 2nd that it had decided to postpone its resignation.

It is understood that the Jordanian cabinet held an emergency meeting on the evening of March 31st and decided to resign to protest certain unconstitutional measures taken by the Jordanian royal family. Some reports said that foreign countries were trying to persuade the King of Jordan to declare a constitutional crisis in order to remove the Nabulsi government, which advocated a policy of active neutrality and opposed the Eisenhower Doctrine.

At the cabinet meeting on the evening of the 2nd, Prime Minister Nabulsi explained his talks with King Hussein and Jordanian Army Chief of Staff General Ali Abu Nuwar. Nabulsi later said, "The interests of the public are what determine the course of action."

According to the Middle East News Agency, the Jordanian government and various political parties held an important meeting last week, at which they agreed on six policies that Jordan should pursue:

One, remove those who support imperialism and the Baghdad Pact from government agencies;

Two, ensure the implementation of the constitution;

Three, oppose American influence in Jordan;

Four, realize the plan to form a federation with Egypt and Syria;

Five, implement the policies of the Arab Liberation Front, especially the policy of active neutrality;

Six, support Arab countries in North Africa and the southern Arabian Peninsula.

During the recent cabinet crisis, many delegations from all walks of life in Jordan visited the Council of Ministers, requesting Jordanian Prime Minister Nabulsi not to resign at a time when the national situation is delicate.

    不让帝国主义的挑拨阴谋得逞
    约旦内阁决定暂不辞职
    并要把支持巴格达条约的分子清除出政府
    新华社开罗4日电　据中东通讯社消息，约旦首相纳布西的内阁在2日晚上宣布，它决定暂不辞职。
    据悉，约旦内阁曾经在3月31日晚上举行紧急会议，决定辞职以抗议约旦王室方面某些不合宪法的措施。有消息说，外国企图劝诱约旦国王宣布宪法危机，以排除主张奉行积极中立政策、反对艾森豪威尔主义的纳布西政府。
    在2日晚的内阁会议上，纳布西首相解释了他同侯赛因国王和约旦陆军参谋长阿里·阿布·诺瓦尔将军的会谈。纳布西后来说：“决定行动方针的是公众的利益。”
    据中东通讯社报道，约旦政府和各政党曾经在上星期举行了重要会议，在会议上商定了约旦应当奉行的六点政策：
    一、把支持帝国主义和巴格达条约的人们从政府机关中清除出去；
    二、保证宪法的执行；
    三、反对美国在约旦的影响；
    四、实现同埃及和叙利亚结成联邦的计划；
    五、执行阿拉伯解放阵线的政策，特别是积极中立的政策；
    六、支援北非和阿拉伯半岛南部地区的阿拉伯国家。
    在最近发生内阁危机期间，约旦各界的许多代表团访问了大臣会议，要求约旦首相纳布西不要在目前全国局势微妙的时候提出辞呈。
