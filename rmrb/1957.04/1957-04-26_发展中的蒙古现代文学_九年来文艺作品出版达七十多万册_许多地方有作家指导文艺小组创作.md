Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 25th — Since the first Congress of the Mongolian Writers' Association in 1948, young modern Mongolian literature has developed rapidly. In these nine years, Mongolia has published more than 100 kinds of literary works such as novels and poems created by Mongolian writers, totaling more than 770,000 copies, exceeding the number published in the more than 20 years before the victory of the People's Revolution.

In these nine years, Mongolia has also published literary journals such as "Literature News" and "Dawn".

On the eve of the second Congress of the Mongolian Writers' Association, Sengge, Chairman of the Mongolian Writers' Association, told reporters that the Mongolian Writers' Association now has more than 360 members and alternate members, while in 1948 there were only 31 members. The Writers' Association has also recently organized 24 literary groups in urban and rural areas with people who love literature and art, and writers often guide them in their creations. These groups have become grass-roots organizations of the Writers' Association.

In recent years, Mongolian writers have created more poems. They also write novels and plays. In the past, playwrights mostly wrote about historical subjects, but recently, plays depicting modern situations have gradually increased. The works of poets are also closer to life. Sengge pointed out that there are not many Mongolian film scripts and children's literature is developing slowly, with fewer people engaged in children's literature creation.

Speaking of the introduction of Mongolian works to foreign countries, Sengge said that China has translated and published the most Mongolian literary works. Novels such as "Ayush" and "On the Altai Mountains" have been translated into Chinese.

Sengge said that more and more Mongolian people love literature and art, and the connection between readers and writers is closer. Writers often meet with readers to listen to their opinions on their works. Mongolian writers are advancing along the path of socialist realism, but writers still have some difficulties in delving into life, and their works lag behind real life and cannot fully meet the needs of readers. This conference will focus on discussing this issue.

    发展中的蒙古现代文学
    九年来文艺作品出版达七十多万册
    许多地方有作家指导文艺小组创作
    新华社乌兰巴托25日电　年青的蒙古现代文学从1948年第一届蒙古作家协会代表大会以来有了迅速的发展。在这九年期间，蒙古共出版了蒙古作家创作的小说、诗歌等文艺作品一百多种，共七十七万多册，超过了人民革命胜利以前二十多年中出版的数字。
    在这九年里，蒙古还出版了“文学报”、“曙光”杂志等文艺刊物。
    蒙古作家协会主席僧格在召开第二届蒙古作家协会代表大会的前夕告诉记者说，现在蒙古作家协会已经有三百六十多名会员和候补会员、而在1948年只有三十一名会员。作家协会最近还在城乡把爱好文艺的人们分别组成了二十四个文艺小组，作家们经常辅导他们进行创作。这些小组变成了作家协会的基层组织。
    最近几年，蒙古作家们创作较多的是诗篇。他们也写小说和剧本。以前剧作家们多半是写历史方面的题材，近来描写现代情况的剧本逐渐多起来了。诗人们的作品也更加接近生活。僧格指出，蒙古的电影剧本创作不多，儿童文学发展较慢，从事儿童文学创作的人较少。
    僧格谈到蒙古作品被介绍到外国的情况说，外国翻译出版蒙古文学作品最多的是中国。“阿尤士”、“在阿尔泰山上”等小说都已经被译成中文。
    僧格说，蒙古人民爱好文艺的人多起来了，读者和作家们的联系也更加密切。作家常和读者见面，听取他们对作品的意见。蒙古作家正沿着社会主义现实主义的创作道路前进，但是作家们对深入生活还存在一些困难问题，作品还落在现实生活的后面，不能完全满足读者的要求。这次大会将要着重讨论这个问题。
