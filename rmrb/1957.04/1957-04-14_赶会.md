    Attending the Fair
    The traditional rural "ancient fairs" are being held as usual this year. At the fair, farmers can buy agricultural and sideline products, daily necessities, and livestock such as donkeys, mules, horses, cattle, sheep, and pigs that they find satisfactory. The "ancient fair" has further prospered the free markets in towns and villages. What is introduced here is the situation on the first day of the annual "ancient fair" in Changgangji, Suixian County, Henan Province.

    赶会
    历来农村中举行的“古会”，今年照常举行。农民们在会上，可以买到自己称心如意的农、副业产品、日用品以及驴、骡、马、牛、羊和生猪等牲畜。“古会”，使城镇和乡村的自由市场更加繁荣了。这里介绍的是河南雎县长岗集一年一度的“古会”第一天的情况。
