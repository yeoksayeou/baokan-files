Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, March 31st: President Nasser said on March 30th: "The purpose of America is to starve us, while the purpose of the Soviet Union is to help us."

Nasser held a three-hour talk with twenty-nine American newspaper, radio and television news reporters. He said: "We are willing to be friends with the United States, but not because we are under pressure to do so. As long as we have wheat and bread, we will continue to resist the pressure... We will not surrender."

Nasser said: "When we faced hunger, the United States refused to give us oil and wheat, while Russia was willing to supply us with grain, as well as medicine and other things.

"Our trade with the Eastern bloc is now increasing, purely because we cannot trade with the West, which is exerting economic pressure for political reasons."

President Nasser also said: "Our goal is to maintain equal relations with all countries. It is completely wrong to say that we are encouraging communism. We have our own philosophy." He said, "Even during Mr. Shepilov's visit (to Egypt), we interrogated communists."

Nasser said that the Gulf of Aqaba and the Suez Canal are Egyptian territorial waters, and Egypt will not allow Israel to use them. He said, "Until the Arab refugee problem is resolved," Egypt will "prevent Israeli ships from passing through the Suez Canal."

According to American reporters, President Nasser explained that if "the rights, property and land of Arab refugees are returned," then Egypt would allow Israeli ships to pass through the canal.

"The United States insists on freedom of navigation, but says nothing about the rights of refugees. If they want to solve the whole problem, then we will too. But considering Israel's rights without considering the rights of refugees is something we cannot accept."

Nasser said that Egypt's hatred of Israel is deeper than it was a year ago. He said, "Because of their aggression against Egypt, the Israelis have proved that they are tools of Britain and France, and could be used in the same way again."

Nasser said: Egypt must build a strong army to deal with the Israeli threat. Egypt has to obtain weapons, which is a matter of life and death and self-defense.

    纳赛尔总统对美国记者说：
    “美国的目的是要使我们挨饿  而苏联的目的是要帮助我们”
    据新华社31日讯　开罗消息：纳赛尔总统3月30日说：“美国的目的是要使我们挨饿，而苏联的目的是要帮助我们。”
    纳赛尔对二十九个美国报纸、无线电和电视广播的新闻记者进行了三小时的谈话。他说：“我们愿意同美国做朋友，但不是因为受到压力而这样做。只要我们还有小麦和面包，我们就将继续抵抗压力……我们不会投降。”
    纳赛尔说：“当我们面临饥饿时，美国拒绝给我们石油和小麦，而俄国愿意供给我们粮食，并且供应药品和其他的东西。
    “我们和东方集团的贸易现在正在增加，原因纯粹是因为我们不能够和西方贸易，西方正在为了政治原因施加经济压力。
    纳赛尔总统又说：“我们的目的是要和一切国家保持平等的关系。说我们正在鼓励共产主义是完全不对的。我们有我们自己的哲学。”他说：“甚至就在谢皮洛夫先生访问（埃及）期间，我们还审讯了共产党人。”
    纳赛尔说，亚喀巴湾和苏伊士运河是埃及的领水，埃及将不让以色列利用它们。他说：“在阿拉伯难民问题未获解决以前”，埃及将
  “阻止以色列船只通过苏伊士运河”。
    据美国记者说，纳赛尔总统解释说，如果“退还阿拉伯难民的权利、财产和土地”那么埃及就会允许以色列船只通过运河。
    “美国坚持航行自由，而对难民的权利问题却只字不提。如果他们要来解决整个的问题，那么我们也要。但是考虑以色列的权利，而不考虑难民的权利，却是我们不可能接受的。”
    纳赛尔说，埃及对以色列的痛恨比一年前更深了。他说，“由于他们对埃及的进攻，以色列人证明了他们是英法的工具，而且有可能再次同样被利用。”
    纳赛尔说：埃及必须建立一支强大的军队来对付以色列的威胁。埃及不得不获得武器，这是一个生死攸关和自卫的问题。
