On the Problem of Enrollment and Employment of Primary and Secondary School Graduates
Liu Weiguang

This year, a portion of primary and secondary school graduates will not be able to continue their education. Many people in society are very concerned about this issue, and some teachers, parents, and students have different views on the issue of enrollment. Some believe it is a pity that some primary and secondary school graduates cannot continue their education this year, while some teachers find it "difficult to talk about" educating students to participate in productive labor, and so on. Are these views correct? I would like to discuss the issue of enrollment and employment of primary and secondary school graduates from the perspective of the imbalance in the number of students at all levels of schools, based on available data from various countries.

In 1050, Italy established the first university, the University of Salerno. By 1600, ninety-nine universities had been established in eighteen European countries, thus declaring the establishment of the modern education system (a system from primary school to secondary school to higher education) that is universally implemented in various countries. Since the formation of this school system, the number of students at all levels of schools in each country has always been unbalanced. The number of students in primary schools is the largest, followed by secondary schools, and the number of students in higher education is the smallest. This situation is very similar to the "pyramid" of Egypt.

We can first look at the number of students in schools at all levels in both old and new China.

(Table 1, Table 2)
(1) Statistics of the Number of Students in Schools at All Levels in Old China from 1942 to 1946 (see attached chart)
(2) Statistics of the Number of Students in Schools at All Levels in the People's Republic of China from 1950 to 1954 (see attached chart)

From the historical statistics of our country, the development speed of education in New China is very fast. Taking the development of primary schools as an example, in the 1946 academic year, there were more than 23.8 million students, which was the year with the largest number of primary school students in Old China. However, after the founding of New China, in the first year, the number of primary school students increased to more than 28.9 million. From the 1950 academic year to the 1954 academic year, the number of primary school students increased from more than 28.9 million to more than 51.2 million in four years, an increase of more than 22.2 million, which is 2.6 times greater than the development speed in Old China from the 1942 academic year to the 1946 academic year (this four-year period saw an increase of more than 6 million primary school students). This fact proves the unparalleled superiority of the socialist education system and shows that the Communist Party of China and the People's Government attach great importance to education. However, the development of education still cannot meet the needs of the people, and some primary and secondary school graduates still cannot continue their education. What is the reason for this?

The development speed of education is restricted by two conditions: one condition is the social productive forces, and the other condition is the social system. The superiority of our country's social system is universally recognized, but our country has only been carrying out socialist construction for five years, and the productive forces are not yet high enough. From the perspective of our country's economic situation, the total national income in 1956 was approximately 110 billion yuan. Based on the national population of 600 million, the average income per person is 183 yuan. A large portion of this must be used as funds for national production and construction and other public undertakings, and the actual income of each person is of course not that high. However, each university student in our country needs about 1,200 yuan per year, and each middle school student needs about 360 yuan per year. However, the average consumption expenditure per farmer in 1956 was 81 yuan. This means that the annual cost for each university student is nearly 15 times the annual consumption expenditure of one farmer. The annual cost for each middle school student is equal to more than four times the annual consumption expenditure of one farmer. From this, it can be seen that under the current national income situation, if we want to cultivate every child to graduate from university, this is absolutely impossible; even primary and secondary schools can only gradually develop along with the development of production, and if too many are established at once, it will greatly hinder the construction of industry and agriculture. This principle is very obvious.

The fact that primary and secondary school graduates cannot all enter higher-level schools is not only the case in China, but also in capitalist countries and socialist brother countries that were liberated earlier than China and have more developed industries, such as Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Romania.

Let's look at the ratio of the number of students in schools at all levels in capitalist countries and socialist countries. (Table 3, Table 4)

(3) Statistics of the Number of Students in Schools at All Levels in Four Capitalist Countries (see attached chart)
(4) Statistics of the Number of Students in Schools at All Levels in Four Socialist Countries (see attached chart)

From the two charts above, it can be seen that the number of middle school students in the United States is about 2.4 times the number of university students, and the number of primary school students is about 3.25 times the number of middle school students; the number of middle school students in the United Kingdom is about 13.48 times the number of university students, and the number of primary school students is about 2.13 times the number of middle school students. The number of middle school students in Czechoslovakia is about 6.85 times the number of university students, and the number of primary school students is about 5.47 times the number of middle school students; the number of middle school students in Poland is about 2.88 times the number of university students, and the number of primary school students is about 9.85 times the number of middle school students. This situation shows that, in the current world, only a portion of primary and secondary school graduates continue their education, while another portion must participate in social production.

Will the imbalance in the number of students at all levels of schools, or this pyramid shape, never change? Of course not. In the process of moving from a socialist society to a communist society, we must not only universalize primary school education and secondary school education, but also gradually universalize higher education in the future. In the future, the number of students in each grade of primary school, middle school, and university will be roughly balanced. This "pyramid" state will be replaced by a "three-dimensional rectangular building." But this will take a long time. Now, let's look at the situation in the Soviet Union.

During the period when the Soviet Union completed socialist construction (1935-1941), from the comparison of the number of students in schools at all levels, although education developed extremely rapidly, it was still basically a pyramid shape. (Table 5)

(5) Statistics of the Number of Students in Schools at All Levels in the Soviet Union in 1933 and 1939 (see attached chart)

Since the Soviet Union began to universalize seven-year school education (equivalent to our junior high school) in 1930 and ten-year school education (equivalent to our high school) in 1951, the comparison of the number of students in schools at all levels has undergone great changes. (Table 6)

(6) Statistics of the Number of Students in Schools at All Levels in the Soviet Union in 1955-1956 (see attached chart)

From the table above, it can be seen that the total number of high school and junior high school students in the Soviet Union has exceeded the number of primary school students. The number of primary school students in the Soviet Union is only 1.35 times the number of junior high school students; the primary school stage in the Soviet Union is four years, and the junior high school stage is three years, so the number of junior high school students in the Soviet Union is about one-quarter less than the number of primary school students (more than 3 million). This means that the number of primary school and junior high school students is roughly balanced, and seven-year education has been fully popularized; the number of junior high school students in the Soviet Union is only 1.66 times the number of high school students, which is because the ten-year education that began in 1951 has not yet been fully popularized. In a few years, the number of high school students will also be balanced with the number of junior high school and primary school students. In other words, the number of primary school and junior high school students in the Soviet Union is no longer in the shape of a pyramid. However, the number of high school students in the Soviet Union is about 3.27 times the number of university students, and a considerable number of high school graduates still cannot continue their education and instead participate in production. This fact shows that with the development of socialist construction, education will also have corresponding development, and the workers and farmers of the Soviet Union will gradually receive higher education and become cultured and educated people.

The Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow. In order to gradually build a three-dimensional rectangular education building in our country, we must first continuously improve labor productivity and lay a good foundation. The participation of primary and secondary school graduates in labor production can greatly improve productivity, so it should not be considered "a pity," but should be considered a good and gratifying phenomenon.

    谈中小学毕业生升学就业问题
    柳维光
    今年将有一部分中、小学毕业生不能升学。许多社会人士对这个问题非常关心，某些教师、家长、学生对于升学问题有各种不同的看法。有人认为今年有些中小学毕业生不能升学很为可惜，有些教师认为教育学生参加生产劳动，“不好说话”，等等。这种看法对不对呢？我想根据现有各国的资料，从各级学校学生人数不平衡的问题来谈谈中、小学毕业生的升学就业问题。
    1050年意大利建立起第一所大学——萨拉尔诺大学，到1600年，欧洲十八个国家内共建立了九十九所大学，于是近代各国普遍实行的教育制度（由小学而中等学校而高等学校的体系），便宣告成立了。自从这个学校体系形成的时候起，每一个国家各级学校的人数一直都是不平衡的。小学的人数最多，中学次之，而高等学校人数最少。这种情况很像埃及的“金字塔”。
    我们可以先看看新、旧中国各级学校在校学生的数目。
   （表一、表二）
    （一）旧中国1942—1946年各级学校学生数目统计表（附图表）
    （二）中华人民共和国1950—1954年各级学校学生数目统计表（附图表）
    从我国历年的统计数字看，新中国教育事业的发展速度是很快的。以小学的发展情况为例，1946年度学生数有二千三百八十余万，这是旧中国小学生人数最多的一年。但是，新中国成立以后，在第一年，小学学生数即增至二千八百九十余万，从1950年度到1954年度，在四年之内，小学学生数由二千八百九十余万增至五千一百二十余万，增加了二千二百二十余万，比之旧中国由1942年度到1946年度四年之间的发展速度（这四年增加小学学生六百余万）增大了二点六倍。这个事实证明社会主义教育制度的无比优越，说明了中国共产党和人民政府对教育事业是十分重视的。但是，教育事业的发展仍然不能满足人民群众的需要，还有一部分中、小学毕业生仍然不能升学，这是什么原因呢？
    教育事业的发展速度要受两个条件所制约：一个条件是社会生产力，另一个条件是社会制度。我国社会制度的优越性是大家公认的，但是，我国进行社会主义建设才刚刚五年，生产力还不够高。从我国的经济状况来看，1956年国民总收入约计一千一百亿元，以全国六亿人口计算，平均每人收入数为一百八十三元。这里边很大一部分要作为国家生产建设的资金及其他公共事业的费用，每一个人的实际收入当然不能这样高。而我国每一个大学生每年需要一千二百元左右，每一个中学生每年需要三百六十元左右。但是，1956年农民每人平均消费额为八十一元。这就是说：每一个大学生每年需要的费用将近十五个农民一年的消费额。每一个中学生每年需要的费用等于四个多农民一年的消费额。由此可见，在目前国民收入的情况下，如果我们要把每一个儿童都培养到大学毕业，这是绝对不可能的事情；就是中小学也只能随着生产发展而逐步发展，一下办多了就会大大妨碍工、农业的建设，这个道理是十分明显的。
    中小学毕业生不能全部升入高一级的学校，不仅中国是如此，就是在资本主义国家以及解放较中国为早、工业比较发展的社会主义兄弟国家如匈牙利、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、罗马尼亚也是如此。
    我们看看下面资本主义国家和社会主义国家各级学校在校学生数的比例。（表三、表四）
    （三）四个资本主义国家各级学校学生数目统计表（附图表）
    （四）四个社会主义国家各级学校学生人数统计表（附图表）
    从上面两个图表可以看出，美国中学学生数约为高等学校学生数的二点四倍，小学学生数约为中学学生数的三点二五倍；英国中学学生数约为高等学校学生数的十三点四八倍，小学学生数约为中学学生数的二点一三倍。捷克斯洛伐克中学学生数约为高等学校学生数的六点八五倍，小学学生数约为中学学生数的五点四七倍；波兰中学学生数约为高等学校学生数的二点八八倍，小学学生数约为中学学生数的九点八五倍。这种情况说明，当前世界各国的中小学毕业生，升学的只是一部分人，而另外一部分人是要参加社会生产的。
    各级学校学生数不平衡的状况，或者说这种金字塔的形式是不是永远不会变化呢？当然不是的。在我们从社会主义社会走向共产主义社会的过程中，我们不只要普及小学教育，普及中学教育，而且将来还要逐步地普及高等教育。将来，小学、中学和高等学校每一年级的人数就会大致平衡。这种“金字塔”的状态就会被“立体式长方形大厦”所代替。但是这需要较长的时间。现在，就来看看苏联的情况。
    苏联在完成社会主义建设时期（1935—1941年）从各级学校学生人数的对比上看，虽然教育发展得极为迅速，但基本上还是一个金字塔形的。（表五）
      （五）苏联1933年和1939年各级学校学生数目统计表（附图表）
    苏联自从1930年开始普及七年制学校教育（相当于我们的初中），1951年开始普及十年制学校教育（相当于我们的高中），各级学校学生数目的对比就起了很大的变化。（表六）
    （六）苏联1955—1956年各级学校学生数目统计表（附图表）
    从上表可以看到苏联高、初中的学生总数已经超过了小学学生数。苏联的小学学生数仅为初中学生数的一点三五倍；苏联小学阶段为四年，初中阶段为三年，因此苏联初中学生数比小学学生数约少四分之一左右（三百余万），这就是说他们的小学和初中学生的数目大体已经平衡，七年制教育已经完全普及了；苏联的初中学生数仅为高中学生数的一点六六倍，这是因为从1951年开始的普及十年制教育现在还未完全普及。几年以后，高中学生数也就会和初中、小学的学生数相平衡了。换句话说，苏联现在小学和初中的学生数目已不是金字塔的形态。但是，苏联的高中学生数目约为高等学校学生数的三点二七倍，相当数量的高中毕业生仍然不能升学，而是参加生产。这一事实说明，随着社会主义建设事业的发展，教育事业也一定有相应的发展，苏联的工人和农民都将逐步受到高等教育，而成为有文化教养的人。
    苏联的今天就是我们的明天，为了在我国逐步地建立一座立体式长方形的教育大厦，首先要不断地提高劳动生产率，把基础打好，而中小学毕业生参加劳动生产可以大大地提高生产力，所以不能认为他们是“可惜”，应该认为这是可喜的好现象。
