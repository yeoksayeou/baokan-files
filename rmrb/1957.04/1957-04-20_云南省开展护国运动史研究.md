Research on the History of the National Protection Movement in Yunnan Province

    Yunnan Province is currently carrying out research on the history of the National Protection Movement. Before liberation, domestic academia had some works on this major event in modern Chinese history, such as Bai Zhihan's "A Brief History of the Yunnan National Protection," You Yunlong's "Draft History of the National Protection," Yu Enyang's "Complete Account of the Yunnan Uprising in Support of the Republic," and Deng Zhicheng's "Veritable Records of the National Protection Army," etc. However, due to the limitations of the conditions at the time, there were great shortcomings in terms of viewpoints and the collection of historical materials.

    In 1956, the Journal of Fudan University published Jin Chongji's article "Who Were the Real Initiators of the Yunnan National Protection Movement?" which affirmed that the real initiators of the National Protection Movement were the middle and lower-ranking officers who had been influenced by the Revolution of 1911.

    At the end of 1956, Xu Songling, an associate professor at Yunnan University, wrote an article "Cai E and the National Protection Movement." When discussing the significance of the National Protection Movement, the paper argued that "The Revolution of 1911 dealt a fatal blow to the autocratic monarchy, resulting in the complete collapse of this system. Unfortunately, Yuan Shikai resurrected it, but after the fatal blow of the National Protection Movement, it collapsed miserably... From then on, the autocratic monarchy completely disappeared in China." In evaluating Tang Jiyao and Cai E, who led the National Protection Movement, the paper argued that Cai E was a revolutionary who escaped Yuan Shikai's net, spared no effort to travel thousands of miles to Yunnan, and launched the National Protection Movement. Tang Jiyao, on the other hand, was a warlord who participated in the National Protection Movement under the pressure of the popular anti-Yuan upsurge and the righteous indignation of middle and lower-ranking officers, and attempted to expand his strength and develop himself. Therefore, after Cai E led his troops to Sichuan, Tang Jiyao stationed heavy troops in Kunming and did not provide support, causing Cai E to be trapped in Sichuan with his isolated army. Although victory was finally achieved, Cai E had already contracted a serious illness and eventually died. Therefore, the paper believes that Cai E was a "loyal and admirable hero" in leading the National Protection Movement, and there were no others besides him. There was an essential difference between Tang and Cai. This paper sparked controversy among attendees from both inside and outside the university at the Yunnan University Science Symposium last year. At that time, the focus of the debate was on the role and significance of the National Protection Movement. Some people believed that the National Protection Movement was a "re-creation of the Republic"; some people believed that it was a power struggle between warlords; more people believed that it would be an exaggeration to regard the National Protection Movement as a "re-creation of the Republic," and it would be inappropriate to regard it as a warlord infighting. From the historical investigation at the time, it should be admitted that the National Protection Movement played a major role in the struggle against Yuan Shikai's attempt to become emperor, and it had a certain progressive significance. Regarding the role of Tang and Cai in the National Protection Movement, most people pointed out that the paper did not collect specific historical facts from the perspective of the general trend of the time and the aspirations of the people, and exaggerated the role of individuals to a certain extent. Attendees also provided the author with some relevant information and clues. After the meeting, this paper aroused widespread attention from elders and scholars in Kunming.

    On February 21 this year, the Yunnan Provincial Political Consultative Conference held a symposium on the historical facts of the National Protection Movement. In addition to some local figures who had participated in or were related to the National Protection Movement, some professors and lecturers from the History Department of Yunnan University also participated. The meeting focused on the discussion of Tang Jiyao and Cai E and their roles in the National Protection Movement. In their speeches, most people believed that opposing Yuan Shikai's becoming emperor was the wish of the people of the whole country, and that the people of Yunnan and Guizhou provinces, who first contributed money and people, played a decisive role. Without the initiative of the people of these two provinces and the response of the people of the whole country, it would have been impossible to achieve victory. In particular, Yunnan and Guizhou provinces were located in the remote southwest and their strength was limited at that time. Without national support, it would have been impossible to resist Yuan Shikai's military pressure. When specifically discussing Tang Jiyao and Cai E, many people believed that Tang and Cai had a close relationship at the time. Before Cai E entered Yunnan, Tang had secretly invited officers above the intermediate level to discuss anti-Yuan matters. After Cai arrived in Hekou, Tang sent his younger brother to greet him and shot Mengzi County magistrate who attempted to kill Cai E to ask Yuan for credit. Afterwards, Tang allowed Cai E to lead his troops out of Yunnan to attack Yuan, etc., all of which showed that Tang and Cai both had merits in the National Protection Movement, and Tang should not be belittled while Cai was praised. At the same time, some people pointed out, based on their personal experiences, that Liang Qichao's writings on the National Protection Movement in the past had many distortions of historical facts. The symposium unanimously believed that there are not only many historical materials about the National Protection Movement in Yunnan, but also some elderly people who participated in the National Protection Movement are still alive. In order to restore the true face of history, it is necessary to further collect and study historical materials in this area. Only after mastering a large amount of relevant information can a correct evaluation be made on all aspects of this historical fact.

      The "Research Group on Historical Facts of the National Protection Movement" was established on March 23. Currently, it is carrying out the collection and collation of historical materials related to the National Protection Movement. (Kang Jun)

### 云南省开展护国运动史研究

    云南省开展护国运动史研究
    云南省目前正在开展护国运动史的研究工作。解放前，国内学术界对我国近代史中的这一件大事，曾有一些著作，如白之瀚的“云南护国简史”，由云龙的“护国史稿”，庾恩暘的“云南首义拥护共和始末记”，邓之诚的“护国军记实”等，但由于当时条件限制，在观点上及史料的汇集上都有很大缺点。
    1956年复旦大学学报登载了金冲及的“云南护国运动的真正发动者是谁？”一文，肯定了护国运动的真正发动者为当时受过辛亥革命熏陶的中下级军官。
    1956年年底，云南大学副教授徐嵩龄写了“蔡锷与护国运动”一文。论文在述及护国运动的意义时，认为“辛亥革命给君主专制制度致命的一击，结果这种制度就因此而完全倒下来。但不幸到了袁世凯又死而复苏，结果经护国运动的致命一击，因而惨重地倒下去。……从此君主专制制度即完全绝迹于中国”。论文在评述领导护国运动的唐继尧和蔡锷时认为，蔡锷是个革命家，逃出袁世凯罗网，不辞辛劳万里入滇，发动护国运动。而唐继尧是个军阀，当时迫于人民反袁高潮和中下级军官义愤参加了护国运动，且企图从中扩充实力，发展自己。因此当蔡锷出师四川后，唐继尧即屯重兵于昆明，不予支援，致使蔡锷在川孤军受困。最后虽然获致胜利但已得重病，终致不起。因之，论文认为蔡锷是领导护国运动中的“忠贞可敬英雄”，除他之外，别无二人。唐、蔡之间有本质上的不同。这篇论文在去年云南大学科学讨论会上，引起了与会的校内外人士的争论。当时争论的焦点在护国运动的作用和意义这一问题上。一些人认为护国运动是“再造共和”；一些人认为它是军阀争权内讧；较多的人认为，若以护国运动为“再造共和”则有些夸大，若以其为军阀内讧也很不当，从当时的历史考察，应该承认护国运动在反袁称帝的斗争中作用是大的，是有一定的进步意义的。对于唐、蔡在护国运动中的作用问题，大多数人指出，论文未从当时大势所趋，人心所向方面汇集具体史实，在一定程度上夸大了个人的作用，与会人士并向作者提供了一些有关这方面的资料、线索。会后，这篇论文引起了昆明的耆老、学者的普遍注意。
    今年2月21日，云南省政协召开了护国运动史实座谈会。参加的除曾参与护国运动和与护国运动有关的一些地方人士外，并有云南大学历史系部分教授、讲师。会上着重讨论了唐继尧、蔡锷二人和他们在护国运动中的作用。在发言中，大多数人认为，反对袁世凯做皇帝是当时全国人民的愿望，而起决定性作用的是当时首先出钱出人的滇、黔两省的人民。没有这两省人民的首倡，没有全国人民的响应，则不可能获得胜利，特别是滇、黔两省偏居西南，当时实力有限，若无全国支援，是不可能抵抗袁世凯的军事压力的。在具体讨论到唐继尧、蔡锷时，许多人认为当时唐、蔡的关系是亲密的，在蔡锷入滇前，唐已秘密邀集中级以上军官商讨反袁，蔡至河口后，唐即派自己的弟弟前往迎接，并枪毙了当时企图杀害蔡锷向袁邀功的蒙自县长，俟后，唐又让蔡锷率领自己的军队出滇讨袁等等，都说明唐、蔡二人在护国运动中都有功绩，不应褒蔡贬唐。同时，部分人又根据自己亲身经历指出过去梁启超在护国运动的著述中有许多歪曲史实的地方，座谈会一致认为，目前在云南不仅有许多护国运动的史料，且部分参与过护国运动的老人也还健在，为了恢复历史的真实面目，有必要进一步搜集和研究这方面的史料，只有大量掌握了有关资料后，才可能对这一历史事实的各方面作出正确的评价。
      “护国运动史实研究工作组”已于3月23日成立。目前正在进行有关护国运动的史料的搜集和整理工作。　　　　（康峻）
