Hundreds of War Horses Donated

(Our report) Many agricultural cooperatives in the Pingliang Special District and the Guyuan Hui Autonomous Prefecture in Gansu have recently accepted 387 war horses donated by the local garrison, as if celebrating a happy event.

When the soldiers delivered the well-fed and glossy-coated horses to the agricultural cooperatives, the members came out of the villages to welcome them, and expressed their commitment to respond to the call of the Party and the government and do everything possible to strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture.

    当战士们将膘肥毛光的马送到农业社时，社员们都走出村庄迎接，并纷纷表示：一定响应党和政府的号召，千方百计地争取农业大丰收。
