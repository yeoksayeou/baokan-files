The Embrace of Eight Hundred Million People
		By Our Correspondent
　　Chairman Voroshilov and Chairman Mao Zedong warmly embraced at Beijing’s Nanyuan Airport yesterday.
　　This is an embrace of the boundless deep feelings of the eight hundred million people of China and the Soviet Union.
　　This demonstrates the unbreakable brotherly alliance between China and the Soviet Union.
　　This symbolizes the united strength of the great socialist camp.
　　Yesterday, the sun was shining brightly, and the spring atmosphere was strong. Our capital was immersed in an ocean of enthusiasm, joy, and friendship.
　　From Tiananmen to Nanyuan Airport, along a road stretching twenty-six *li*, a million men, women, and children formed two walls of people, like a huge ribbon running through half the city.
　　As the clock approached three, a silver Tu-104 jet airliner appeared in the boundless clear sky, and the crowd waiting at the airport to welcome the guests cheered.
　　When the seventy-six-year-old Chairman Voroshilov, with the vigorous steps of a hero, stepped off the plane, Chairman Mao Zedong stepped forward to shake his hand warmly and exchanged cordial greetings.
　　The band played the national anthems of the Soviet Union and China, and the guard of honor composed of the three services of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army received the distinguished guests’ inspection. Thunderous cheers continuously erupted from the square, and countless bouquets of flowers were presented to the distinguished guests.
　　At this moment, all the people in Beijing, all of China, and the world heard Chairman Mao Zedong’s welcoming speech and Chairman Voroshilov’s reply over the radio, and heard the thunderous applause and cheers from the airport.
　　After finishing his speech, Chairman Voroshilov could not help but take off his top hat, lean over and kiss Chairman Mao's cheek, and embrace Chairman Mao. In that instant, everyone in the audience felt extremely excited and warm.
　　In the welcoming crowd, Chairman Mao introduced Chairman Voroshilov to the people nearby, praising his vigor and robustness in old age. People affectionately called Chairman Voroshilov "Old Voroshilov" according to Chinese custom.
　　The heroic name of this Old Voroshilov is familiar to the Chinese people. Many people were familiar with this old hero forty years ago.
　　The fifty-year-old scientist Gao Shiqi did not even eat lunch that day, and sat in his specially made wheelchair, pushed by his family to the airport. When Old Voroshilov learned of his life story, he held his hand for a long time.
　　Fu, an old woman from the Nanyuan Township Agricultural Cooperative, heard a week ago that Old Voroshilov was coming, and she also heard that Chairman Mao would personally come to welcome him. She told the comrades in the cooperative long ago: "On April 15th, I won't come to the cooperative, I want to see our distinguished guests and Chairman Mao. This time, I am determined not to use my crutches." She indeed did not use crutches to welcome Old Voroshilov.
　　After this kind Old Voroshilov and his entourage made a round of the field, they boarded a green convertible car with Chairman Mao and left the airport.
　　Along the way, the welcoming masses held flags and bouquets, beat gongs and drums, sang songs, and cheered and applauded the distinguished guests in the car.
　　Workers, peasants, students, government cadres, industrialists and businessmen, and housewives came to the streets as early as ten o'clock in the morning to welcome the distinguished guests. They said: Today is a day of great joy. They picked countless flowers, plucked petals, and sprinkled them like raindrops on the distinguished guests. Old Voroshilov waved frequently to them.
　　Among the welcoming crowd outside Yongdingmen, the emotions of the young students were particularly high. Zhang, Jiazhen, Lin Qizhao and other students in the third grade of the No. 5 Girls' High School had all heard Old Voroshilov's childhood stories, knew that he had lost his schooling at a young age, participated in productive labor, joined the Communist Party, and learned a wealth of knowledge under the Party's cultivation, and expressed their great admiration.
　　Before the car had passed, a seventeen- or eighteen-year-old Soviet girl was walking hurriedly on Qianmen Street; however, the densely packed welcoming crowd blocked her way. She had to stop in front of the No. 12 Girls' Middle School team, and they immediately began to talk. It turned out that this Soviet girl's name was Kramarinenina. She had just come to Beijing from the Soviet Union with her father last December. Her home was outside Qianmen, and she had just returned home from school today. Because of the language barrier, they could not fully communicate. They pointed to the large slogan on the south wall of the Qianmen Arrow Tower and recited in unison: "Long live the friendship and unity between the Chinese and Soviet people!" They were all very happy to have met good friends.
　　The car drove into Tiananmen Square. It was impossible to count how many people were here, but tens of thousands of red flags were waving together in the sunlight, like burning flames; it was also impossible to hear the sound of slogans clearly, only a joyous shout was heard. Chairman Mao smiled and turned his face to Voroshilov and said a sentence; Voroshilov then cast his gaze on the magnificent Tiananmen. In that instant, his bright, chestnut-colored eyes emitted an excited but benevolent light. His silver hair shone even more dazzlingly in the sunlight, and his face looked even rosier.
　　The crowd sprinkled fresh petals on the distinguished guests, and the car looked as if it was made of flowers. Chairman Voroshilov was still staring at Tiananmen, and Chairman Mao waved to the cheering crowd. At this moment, a string of colored balloons rose in front of them. All the girls holding the balloons released the strings in their hands. In an instant, a thousand large and small colored balloons floated lightly in the clear sky. Someone read the slogan hanging on the big balloon: "Long live Sino-Soviet friendship!" Chairman Voroshilov looked up and watched the spring breeze carry the red, blue, yellow... balloons, rising into the sky!
　　The newly sprinkled asphalt road was like a river of surging enthusiasm; the cheering crowds on both sides were like blooming flowers and noisy spring embankments; the motorcade of distinguished guests was like a fleet carrying great friendship, it was carrying so much that it could only sail very slowly.
　　The convertible car carrying the heads of state of China and the Soviet Union moved slowly westward. The setting sun shone on the faces of Chairman Mao and Chairman Voroshilov, emitting a kind, wise, and loving light.
　　"They are so healthy!"—such a voice came from the crowd, expressing concern and wishes for the most beloved people with incomparable excitement and joy.
　　The car drove past, and people still stood on tiptoe and stretched their necks to look westward. It was not until 5:10 in the afternoon, when the distinguished guests had entered Xinhua Gate, that the crowd in Tiananmen Square gradually dispersed.
　　As the sun set, the endless stream of welcoming crowds talked everywhere on the way home about the warm embrace of the two heads of state, exchanging their unforgettable impressions after seeing the distinguished guests. Everyone felt that they had spent a glorious and happy day today.
　　The roots of Sino-Soviet friendship are deeper in people's hearts, our love and friendship for the Soviet people is stronger, and the great internationalist unity of our two countries is forever, forever.

    八亿人民的拥抱
    本报记者
    伏罗希洛夫主席和毛泽东主席昨天在北京南苑飞机场上热烈地拥抱了。
    这是中苏两国八亿人民的无限深情的拥抱。
    这表现着中苏之间牢不可破的兄弟同盟。
    这象征着伟大的社会主义阵营的团结力量。
    昨天，艳阳当空，春意正浓。我们的首都沉浸在一片热情、欢乐和友谊的海洋里。
    从天安门到南苑机场，在长达二十六里的道路上，一百万男女老少结成了两道人的围墙，像一条巨大的彩带贯穿着半个城市。
    时针快要指到三点的时候，一架银色的图一一○四喷气式客机出现在一望无际的晴空，伫候在机场上欢迎的人群都为之欢动。
    当七十六岁的伏罗希洛夫主席迈着英雄的健步，走下飞机的时候，毛泽东主席上前同他热烈地握手，并且亲切地互相问好。
    乐队奏起了苏中两国的国歌，由中国人民解放军海陆空三军组成的仪仗队接受了贵宾的检阅，广场上不断发出了震天的欢呼，无数的鲜花一束一束地献给了贵宾。
    全北京、全中国和全世界的人们，在这个时刻都从广播上听到了毛泽东主席的欢迎词和伏罗希洛夫主席的答词，听到了机场上雷动的掌声和欢呼声。
    伏罗希洛夫主席讲完了话，情不自禁地脱下礼帽，倾身亲吻了毛主席的脸颊，同毛主席拥抱起来了。在这一刹那，全场每一个人的心头都感到极大的激动和温暖。
    在欢迎的人海中，毛主席向近旁的人介绍了伏罗希洛夫主席，称赞他的精神矍铄，老而益壮。人们按照中国的习惯，都亲切地称呼伏罗希洛夫主席为“伏老”。
    这位伏老的英名，在我们中国人民的心中是熟悉的。有许多人在四十年前就很熟悉这位老英雄了。
    五十多岁的科学家高士其，在这一天连午饭都没有吃，就坐着他那特制的手推车，由他的家属推着赶到机场。伏老知道了他的身世，长时间地握了他的手。
    南苑镇农业合作社的傅老太太，在一个星期以前就听说伏老要来，她还听说毛主席也亲自来欢迎。她老早就告诉社里的同志们说：“4月15日，我可不到社里来啦，我要去看看我们的贵宾和毛主席。这一次，我决心不拄拐杖去。”她果然没有拄拐杖去欢迎伏老了。
    这位慈祥的伏老和他的随行者绕场一周以后，同毛主席一起登上一辆绿色的敞篷汽车离开机场。
    沿途欢迎的群众拿着旗子和花束，敲着锣鼓，唱着歌，向着汽车上的贵宾欢呼鼓掌。
    工人、农民、学生、机关干部、工商业者、家庭妇女为了迎接贵宾，从早晨十一点钟就来到街上，他们说：今天是大喜的日子。他们采了无数的鲜花，摘下花瓣，像雨点般地撒在贵宾的身上。伏老频频挥手向他们致意。
    在永定门外欢迎的人群中，青年学生的情绪特别高涨。女五中高中三年级的学生张家真、林启昭等人都听过伏老的幼年故事，知道他自幼失学，参加生产劳动，参加共产党，在党的培养下学到很丰富的知识，都表示非常敬仰。
    当汽车还没有驶过的时候，在前门大街上有一位十七、八岁的苏联姑娘急急忙忙地走着；但是，密密层层的群众欢迎队伍挡住了她的去路。她只好在女十二中的队伍面前停下来，她们立即交谈起来。原来这个苏联姑娘的名字叫做克拉马林克尼娜，去年12月才和她的父亲从苏联来到北京，她的家在前门外，今天刚从学校回家。她们因为语言的关系不能充分交谈，她们用手指着前门箭楼南墙上的那幅大标语，同声念着：“中苏两国人民友好团结万岁！”她们都非常高兴认识了好朋友。
    汽车驶进了天安门广场。数不清这里有多少人，但见阳光里几万面红旗一齐摇动，像燃起了炽烈的火焰；这里也听不清口号的声音，只听到一片欢乐的呼喊。毛主席微笑着把脸转向伏罗希洛夫，讲了一句话；伏罗希洛夫就把视线投向了金碧辉煌的天安门。这一瞬间，他的炯炯有神的栗色的眼睛发射着激动的但是慈祥的光辉。他的银色的头发照着阳光更加耀眼，他的脸庞也显得更加红润了。
    群众把新鲜的花瓣向贵宾撒去，那汽车简直像是用鲜花扎成的。伏罗希洛夫主席还是注视着天安门，毛主席向狂欢的人群招手致意。这时候，一串彩色的气球从他们前面升起。所有拿着气球的姑娘放松了她们手里的线。霎时间，明净如水的天空里，轻飘飘地升起上千个大大小小的彩色的气球。有人念着那大气球上面挂着的标语：“中苏友好万岁！”伏罗希洛夫主席抬起头来，目送春风携着红色的、蓝色的、黄色的……气球，升向高空！
    刚刚洒水的柏油路像一条热情澎湃的河；两旁欢呼的人群像百花盛开、春意喧闹的堤岸；贵宾们的汽车的行列就像载着伟大友谊的船队，它载得那样重，以致只能航行得非常缓慢。
    载着中苏两国元首的敞篷汽车，向西缓缓行进。西斜的太阳光照射在毛主席和伏罗希洛夫主席的脸上，发出慈祥、智慧和友爱的光芒。
    “他们多健康啊！”——人群里发出了这样的声音，这声音以无比的激动和喜悦，表达了对最敬爱的人的关心和祝愿。
    汽车驶过去了，人们还踮着脚尖、伸长脖颈向西望着。直到下午五点十分，贵宾们已经进了新华门，天安门广场的群众才逐渐散开。
    夕阳西斜，川流不息的欢迎群众在归途中到处谈论着两国元首的热情拥抱，交换着他们瞻仰贵宾以后的难忘印象。每一个人都感到他们今天度过了光荣的、幸福的一天。
    中苏友谊的根子在人们的心坎里扎得更深了，我们对苏联人民的热爱和友谊是更加强了，我们两国的伟大国际主义的团结是永远的，永远的。
