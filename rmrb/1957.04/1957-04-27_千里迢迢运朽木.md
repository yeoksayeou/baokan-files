    Transporting Decayed Wood from Afar

    In the first quarter of this year, the Ministry of Forest Industry allocated wood to our Beijing Third Construction Engineering Company, much of which was completely unusable. Some of the wood had cavities large enough for a person to sit in. It was not only unsuitable as raw material for building houses, but even too rotten to be used as material for growing mushrooms. According to my understanding, five units alone, including the Railway Institute, received over 334,000 cubic meters of such substandard wood. Each cubic meter of substandard wood originally costs 16 yuan, and the transportation from the Chaihe Forest Management Bureau in Northeast China to Beijing costs 24 yuan. The transportation costs for 334,000 cubic meters alone wasted approximately 8 million yuan. The losses caused by delays in construction are incalculable.

    When signing the contract, we specifically requested not to receive substandard wood. However, comrades from the Ministry of Forest Industry said, "This is our system. In order to increase production and practice economy, as long as a log can yield 20% usable material, it must be used in conjunction [with other wood]."

    I ask the Ministry of Forest Industry, can this kind of "log" in the photo really yield 20% usable material?

    千里迢迢运朽木
    今年第一季度，森林工业部拨给我们北京市第三建筑工程公司的木材中，有很多根本不能使用，有的木材的空洞里能够坐进一个人，不但不能作建筑房屋用的原料，连作生产蘑菇的原料都嫌糟过了性。据我了解，这样的等外材，仅铁道学院等五个单位，就有三十三万四千多立方公尺。每一立方公尺等外木材原价十六元，由东北柴河森林管理局运到北京来，运费要二十四元；三十三万四千多立方公尺，光运费就浪费了八百多万元左右。耽误施工造成的损失，就难以计算了。
    订合同的时候，我们就提出过不要等外材，但是，森林工业部的同志却说：“这是我们的制度，为了增产节约，一根原木只要能出20％的料，就得配搭着使用。”
    请问森林工业部，难道像这种照片里的这种“原木”，也能出20％的料吗？
