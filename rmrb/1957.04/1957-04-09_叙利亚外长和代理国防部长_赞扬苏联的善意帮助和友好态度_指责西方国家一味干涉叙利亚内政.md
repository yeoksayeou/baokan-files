Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, April 8th - Pakistan Press International reported today that Syrian Foreign Minister Bitar, in an interview with the news agency's Middle East correspondent, said: "We thank the Soviet Union for the assistance it has given us and its friendly attitude towards us. Our relations with it are very friendly. But this has nothing to do with communist ideology."

Bitar said that Syria had not received any aid from the Soviet Union. "We only purchased arms from the Soviet Union on a payment basis." He also said that Syria had not concluded any alliance with the Soviet Union, nor had it given the Soviet Union any bases.

Bitar said that Arabs must wage a two-front struggle against imperialism and against Israel.

Regarding the Kashmir issue, Bitar said that the heads of four Arab countries recently discussed the need to find a fair solution to the Kashmir issue during a meeting in Cairo. He said that the Arab summit, attended by the leaders of Syria, Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia, agreed to contact Pakistan and India in this regard.

Syrian Acting Defense Minister Azem told a Pakistan Press International reporter that imperialists hope to gain a foothold in every country that has been liberated in order to restore their lost position. Therefore, they are trying their best to portray the Soviet Union as an enemy. However, Syria's friendship with the Soviet Union is based on reciprocity and goodwill.

Azem said that the Soviet Union has never attempted to influence our views. On the other hand, Western countries have been trying to interfere in our country's internal affairs. The Soviet Union does not want to conclude any alliances or obtain any bases as a reward for its assistance to Syria. Western countries are unwilling to provide any assistance without concluding treaties and obtaining bases.

Referring to the Kashmir issue, Azem said that Pakistan and India are two friendly Eastern countries, and Syria, as another Eastern country, hopes that these two countries will establish friendly relations.

He said that there is no communist terror in Syria, and it firmly believes in the policy of positive neutrality and peaceful coexistence. We will fight Western imperialism at all costs.

Xinhua News Agency, April 8th, Damascus dispatch: Syrian Prime Minister al-Asali announced on April 7th the lifting of the martial law in the three regions of Damascus, Homs, and Suwayda in order to provide conditions for free by-elections to the parliament.

The by-elections will be held on May 4th, and this election will elect four members of parliament to fill the vacancies of the four former members of parliament who were recently sentenced to long-term imprisonment for conspiracy to treason.

    叙利亚外长和代理国防部长
    赞扬苏联的善意帮助和友好态度
    指责西方国家一味干涉叙利亚内政
    新华社卡拉奇8日电　巴基斯坦报联社今天报道，叙利亚外交部长比塔尔在接见这家通讯社驻中东的特派记者时说：“我们感谢苏联给予我们的帮助和它对我们所抱的友好态度。我们同它的关系非常友好。但是这跟共产主义思想毫无关系。”
    比塔尔说，叙利亚并没有从苏联得到任何援助。“我们只是以付款方式向苏联购买了军火。”他还说，叙利亚并没有同苏联缔结任何联盟，它也没有给苏联任何基地。
    比塔尔说，阿拉伯人必须进行反对帝国主义和反对以色列的两条战线的斗争。
    关于克什米尔问题，比塔尔说，四个阿拉伯国家的首脑最近在开罗举行会议的时候曾经讨论了设法公正地解决克什米尔问题的必要性。他说，由叙利亚、埃及、约旦和沙特阿拉伯四国领袖参加的阿拉伯最高级会议同意在这方面同巴基斯坦和印度进行接洽。
    叙利亚代理国防部长阿泽姆对巴基斯坦报联社记者说，帝国主义者希望在每一个已经得到解放的国家取得一个立足点，以便恢复他们失去的地位。因此他们竭力想把苏联说成是敌人。但是叙利亚同苏联的友谊是以互惠和善意为基础的。
    阿泽姆说，苏联从来没有企图影响过我们的见解。另一方面，西方国家却一直在设法干涉我国的内政。苏联并不希望缔结任何联盟或者得到任何基地作为它帮助叙利亚的报酬。西方国家是不愿意在不缔结条约和得不到基地的情况下给予任何援助的。
    阿泽姆在提到克什米尔问题的时候说，巴基斯坦和印度是两个友好的东方国家，叙利亚作为另一个东方国家希望这两个国家建立友好关系。
    他说，叙利亚并没有共产主义的恐怖，它坚信积极中立和和平共处的政策。我们将不惜任何代价跟西方帝国主义进行斗争。
    新华社8日讯　大马士革消息：叙利亚总理阿萨利4月7日宣布解除大马士革、霍姆斯和索威达三个地区的戒严状态，以便为自由地进行议会补缺选举提供条件。
    补缺选举将在5月4日举行，这次选举将选出四个议员，以填补最近因为阴谋叛国案而被判长期徒刑的四个前议员的空缺。
