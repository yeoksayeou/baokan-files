Having seen the performance of the Forward Song and Dance Troupe, I feel that, judging from the entire performance, the artistic level of the actors is good, and the lineup is also very neat. They have a strong breath of life and a strong local flavor; this is very important for a local military song and dance troupe.

Their programs give people the impression of being vigorous in style, simple and sincere. The expression of the content of the works does not rely on excessive or unnecessary movements and expressions to help complete it. Every word of all the singing programs is clear, and every sentence is pleasing to the ear, which is really commendable.

In all the choral programs, the female chorus "Sending My Husband to Join the Anti-Japanese Army" and "Having a Wife, Forgetting Your Mother" are humorous and endearing; the humor in the songs also has no awkwardness. The male bass part in the mixed chorus is slightly thin. For example, the song "Cavalry Patrol" feels inadequate. "Singing Folk Songs in Full Swing" has a beautiful melody, especially the female voices, which are gentle and moving. The three Northeast folk songs sung by female alto Li Hui are full of expressiveness, with clear pronunciation, very cordial, and quite able to capture people's hearts; however, the timbre is somewhat dark, and the movements and expressions are also superficial. The male bass soloist Gu Wei has the skill and cultivation, but the emotions are not deep enough; the song "The Yellow River Has Eighteen Bends" is inherently difficult to express, so more effort is needed in the variation of dynamics.

Compared with the music programs, I think the achievements in dance seem to be more prominent.

In my opinion, as a layman, the primary key to a dance art work lies in whether the creator's conception is novel, and whether the author is good at skillfully arranging the plot. Without this, even actors with superb skills will have nothing to rely on and will find it difficult to perform. For example, "The Day of Enlistment," "Before the First Guard Duty," and "Patrol Soldiers of Changbai Mountain" all show this characteristic. I especially like "Before the First Guard Duty," its plot is extremely simple, but it shows the creator's intelligence and talent. There are only two performers. A young soldier who has just joined the army, with excitement, before standing guard, repeatedly tidies up his clothes and appearance in front of the mirror; his expression is both serious and mischievous. The most interesting thing is that the so-called mirror is just an empty frame, without any glass. The soldier walks towards the mirror, and a soldier in the same dress comes out from the left of the stage, facing the former, imitating his movements and expressions: wiping the mirror, tidying the hat, making faces, all done vividly. The mirror-gazer leaves, and the person in the mirror also leaves, and so on three times. Although the program is short, it is very touching. Unfortunately, the rhythm of the accompaniment music is not strong, and it fails to complement each other. Another example is "The Day of Enlistment," which depicts rural women sending their loved ones to join the army. The theme is also ordinary, but the insertion of an interesting plot makes it look vivid and quite interesting. An old couple is vying to send their two sons to enlist. The old woman is afraid that the younger son is small and weak, so she hides some water pipes, steelyard weights and other objects on him. As a result, it is exposed when weighing, becoming a joke. I think that in this program, it seems far-fetched to have the couple perform a Yangko dance in front of the masses after weighing; at the same time, it is unreasonable for rural women to wear ancient costumes and long skirts, and it is also inconsistent with the costumes of other characters. Another example is "Patrol Soldiers of Changbai Mountain," which has a strong storyline, a tense plot, and is exciting. It can be clearly seen that it has absorbed the techniques of the Chinese opera martial arts scene in its performance, and also absorbed the characteristics of Soviet dances that express military life; but it is not fused enough, and the rhythm changes are not obvious. However, the accompaniment music helped a lot. Another classical dance, "A Rendezvous in the Peach Orchard," is full of poetic and picturesque imagery, and the performance of the male and female protagonists is also very vivid, and the female image seems to be more beautiful.

The dragon is a product of the Chinese people's ideals, and it is the embodiment of auspiciousness and bravery. Every year during the Lantern Festival, rural and urban areas all dance the dragon lantern. The Forward Song and Dance Troupe has brought this folk dance "Dragon Lantern," which is performed in the square, to the stage, which is their own creation.

As the saying goes: good flowers need green leaves to set them off. So finally, I would like to talk about the band. It is basically satisfactory. The music of "Patrol Soldiers of Changbai Mountain" and "A Rendezvous in the Peach Orchard" each have their own characteristics, and the sound effects can greatly enhance the dance performance. Recently, the question of "which is Chinese and which is Western" regarding the use of orchestras in dance art has been debated endlessly. I think it should be based on the content and genre of the program. This time, the Forward Song and Dance Troupe's orchestra sometimes uses all ethnic instruments, sometimes all Western instruments, and sometimes a combination of Chinese and Western instruments, but they can all achieve their purpose and achieve good results.

    写于前进歌舞团演出之后
    其庄
    看了前进歌舞团的演出，我觉得从整个演出看来，演员艺术水平不错，阵容也很整齐。它们有强烈的生活气息和浓厚的地方色彩；作为一个地方的部队歌舞团，这一点是很重要的。
    他们的节目给人以风格健朗、朴质和亲切的印象。对于作品内容的表达，并没有依靠过多的、不必要的动作表情来帮助完成。所有的歌唱节目字字清楚，句句入耳，真是难能可贵。
    在所有的合唱节目中，女声小合唱“送郎参加抗日军”和“娶了媳妇忘了娘”饶有风趣，逗人喜爱；歌中的幽默表现也无别扭之感。混声合唱中的男低音部稍嫌单薄，例如歌唱“骑兵巡逻队”，就有不足之感。“红红火火唱山歌”曲调优美，尤以女声唱得娓娓动听，感人至深。女中音李惠所唱的三首东北民歌富于表现力，吐字圆真，亲切非常，颇能抓住人心；唯音色有些暗淡，动作表情也流于浮面。男低音独唱者顾威的技巧修养有火候，但感情还不够深刻；“天下黄河十八湾”一曲本不易表现，因此还需在力度变化上下点功夫。
    比起音乐节目来，我以为舞蹈方面的成就似更突出些。
    依我这个外行看来，一个舞蹈艺术作品，首要的关键在于创作者的构思是否新颖，在于作者是否善于巧妙地安排情节。缺乏这个，纵有技巧卓越的演员也无所依据，难以发挥。如“应征的那天”、“第一次站岗之前”、“长白山巡逻兵”等，都能看出这个特点。我特别喜爱“第一次站岗之前”，它的情节极为简单，但表现了创作者的聪颖才智。表演者仅仅两人。一个新入伍的年青战士怀着兴奋的心情，在站岗之前，对着镜子，反复地整饬服装仪容；其表情既认真又调皮。最有意思的是所谓镜子不过是一个空洞洞的大框子，并没有什么玻璃。战士走向镜子，台左出来一个同样装束的战士，面对前者，模仿他的动作表情：擦镜、整冠、做鬼脸，都做得唯妙唯肖。照镜者离去，镜中之人亦离去，如此者再三。节目虽短，却很动人。可惜伴奏乐曲节奏感不强，未能相得益彰。又如“应征的那天”，描写农村妇女送爱人当兵，题材原也平常，但其中穿插了一段有趣的情节，看来就显得生动，也颇有趣味。一对年老夫妇，争着送两个儿子去应征，老太婆怕小儿子人小体轻，就在他身上藏上些水烟袋、秤铊之类物件，结果过磅时被揭穿，成为笑话。我觉得这个节目中：让两口子于过磅之后在群众面前扭一段秧歌，似嫌牵强；同时，农村妇女皆着古装长裙，于情理不合，也与其他人物服装相矛盾。再如“长白山巡逻兵”，故事性较强，情节紧张，扣人心弦。明显地看得出来它在表演上吸收了中国戏曲武场的手法，也吸收了苏联表现部队生活的舞蹈的特点；但还不够融合，节奏变化也不明显。倒是伴奏音乐帮了大忙。另外一个古典舞蹈“桃林相会”充满诗情画意，男女主角的表演也很生动，女的形象似乎更美些。
    龙是中国人民理想的产物，是吉祥、勇敢的化身，年年元宵佳节，农村城市无不舞耍龙灯。前进歌舞团把这种在广场演出的民间舞蹈“龙灯”搬上舞台，是有自己的创造的。
    俗话说：好花还得绿叶扶。所以最后我想谈一谈乐队。它基本上是令人满意的。“长白山巡逻兵”和“桃林相会”的音乐各有特色，音响效果很能烘托舞蹈表演。近来关于舞蹈艺术乐队运用的问题“孰中孰西”，争论不休。我以为应以节目的内容和体裁为依据。这次前进歌舞团的乐队，有时全用民族的，有时全用西洋的，有时中西合用，但都能达到它的目的，取得良好的效果。（附图片）
