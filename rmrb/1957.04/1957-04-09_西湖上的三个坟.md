Title: Three Tombs on West Lake

The West Lake has three tombs where the remains of national heroes are buried: Yue Fei's tomb at Qixia Ridge, Yu Qian's tomb at Santai Mountain, and Zhang Cangshui's tomb at Nanping Mountain. These three tombs are the glory of West Lake.

Chairman Mao said: "All ethnic groups in the Chinese nation oppose oppression by foreign nations and must use resistance to remove this oppression. They approve of equal unity and disapprove of mutual oppression. In the thousands of years of history of the Chinese nation, many national heroes and revolutionary leaders have emerged." (Mao Zedong: "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party") Among the many national heroes, Yue Fei and Yu Qian both made great contributions to resisting foreign invasions but were wrongly killed by treacherous officials and corrupt rulers. However, for hundreds of years, even six- or seven-year-old children have known about Yue Fei, but not many people know about Yu Qian. This is understandable. Yue Fei's target of resistance was the powerful Jurchen people. The Jurchen people later established the Jin Dynasty in northern China and united with the Han landlords in the north to carry out national oppression and feudal exploitation of Chinese peasants. The Chinese people opposed this oppression and exploitation, and they naturally greatly admired Yue Fei, the national hero who personally led his army, repeatedly defeated the Jin soldiers, and even made the heroic statement of "drinking merrily at Huanglong." Furthermore, after being described in literary works such as "The Complete Biography of Yue Fei," even six- or seven-year-old children could tell stories of the Yue Family Army fighting the Jin soldiers. As for Yu Qian, his target of resistance was the Oirat Mongols. The Oirat Mongols were originally a branch of the Mongolian people and were far less powerful than the Jurchen people in Yue Fei's time. Also, Esen of the Oirat Mongols was far less formidable than Wuzhu of the Jurchen people. They invaded our border, aiming at plunder, and had no ambition to establish a dynasty in China. Only because the Ming Dynasty emperor (Yingzong) was昏瞆胡涂 (muddleheaded), listening to the words of the eunuchs, did the so-called "Tumu Crisis" occur. Yu Qian came out to support the precarious situation, took a series of emergency measures, and also repelled the Oirat soldiers who besieged Beijing, forcing Esen to retreat when he knew it was difficult, and finally even sent back the captured emperor. In short, although the invasion of the Oirat Mongols was very serious for a time, because Yu Qian handled it properly, he quickly repelled them, so later generations did not have as deep an understanding of Yu Qian as they did of Yue Fei, and fewer people knew about Yu Qian than knew about Yue Fei.

However, if we make a specific analysis of the specific situation, then Yu Qian's merits are by no means below Yue Fei's. When the news of the defeat of the 500,000-strong army at Tumu Fort and the capture of the emperor was conveyed to the capital, timid lecturers like Xu Cheng advocated moving the capital. Yu Qian firmly opposed it, advocating the establishment of a new ruler, repairing war preparations, and expressing that "the loss of a ruler is followed by a new ruler, the ministers are harmonious, and the soldiers are increasing," so that Esen had nothing to hold him hostage and could not drive south. He personally supervised the battle outside Deshengmen in Beijing, confronting Esen for five days, and finally repelled the Oirat soldiers. At that time, Yu Qian only had the country and the people in his mind and did not put the emperor captured by Esen in his heart. There is evidence to prove this: when Esen besieged Beijing, he brought the unlucky emperor and placed him in his own barracks, thinking that this would make Yu Qian apprehensive and dare not make a fierce resistance. But Yu Qian did not care about this and ordered artillery fire to bombard Esen's barracks, killing and wounding thousands of Oirat soldiers, and Esen's younger brother was also killed. Although some people have defended Yu Qian, saying that "it was first sent to spies to find out that the place where Yingzong was stationed was far away from the camp, so artillery fire was used to attack Esen's camp, killing thousands of people" ("Ming History Research" quoted Zhang Xu's "Wan Yan Lu"), this is the view and idea of a pedantic scholar, they do not understand that Yu Qian is a national hero, and only regard him as a loyal subject of the Zhu Ming family.

After Yu Qian was wrongly killed by Yingzong, his remains were transported back to his hometown (Qiantang) and buried under Santai Mountain in West Lake. Two centuries later, the Qing people entered the customs, and many national heroes emerged, among whom Zhang Cangshui resisted to the end and died unyielding. He wrote such lines of poetry: "The country is destroyed and the family is broken, what is the purpose? At the head of West Lake, there is my teacher: the sun and moon are both hanging over Yu's tomb, and half of the heaven and earth is the Yue family temple..." As a result, Zhang Cangshui got what he wanted, and there was one more tomb of a national hero on West Lake, standing shoulder to shoulder with Yue Fei's tomb and Yu Qian's tomb. With these three tombs, West Lake not only adds color to the lake and mountains, and enhances the glory of the nation, but also plays a great role in patriotic education. It is a pity that since liberation, those in charge of cultural relics management and those in charge of West Lake garden management have only paid attention to Yue Fei's tomb and Yue Fei's temple, but not to Yu Qian's tomb and Zhang Cangshui's tomb, allowing them to be deserted and not repaired. This is very wrong. This year is the 500th anniversary of Yu Qian's killing. We should commemorate him in various ways, writing articles and making reports. Through commemorating Yu Qian, we can carry out specific and profound patriotic education and arouse the interest of the general public in learning about the history of the motherland; at the same time, we should sort out Yu Qian's tomb and Zhang Cangshui's tomb and restore their original appearance.

### 西湖上的三个坟

    西湖上的三个坟
    宋云彬
    西湖上有三个埋葬民族英雄遗骨的坟：栖霞岭下的岳坟，三台山下的于坟，南屏山下的张苍水坟。西湖上有这三个坟，是西湖的光荣。
    毛主席说：“中华民族的各族人民都反对外来民族的压迫，都要用反抗的手段解除这种压迫。他们赞成平等的联合，而不赞成互相压迫。在中华民族的几千年的历史中，产生了很多的民族英雄和革命领袖。”（毛泽东：“中国革命和中国共产党”）很多的民族英雄当中，岳飞和于谦都是抵抗外来民族侵略立下大功而反给奸臣、昏君冤杀了的。然而几百年来，谈到岳飞连六、七岁的小孩子都知道，谈到于谦知道的人就不多了。这是可以理解的。岳飞的反抗对象是强大的女真族。女真族后来在中国北部建立了金国，跟北方的汉族地主联合起来，对中国农民进行民族压迫和封建剥削。中国人民反对这种压迫和剥削，对于那位亲领大军，屡次打败金兵，还作出“痛饮黄龙”的豪语的民族英雄岳飞，自然非常敬仰；再经过
  “说岳全传”一类的文学作品的描写，使得六、七岁的小孩子都会讲岳家军打金兵的故事了。至于于谦，他的反抗对象是瓦剌部。瓦剌部原是蒙古族的一支，远不及岳飞时候的女真族那么强大。瓦剌部的也先也万万比不上那女真族的兀术。他们侵扰我国边境，志在掠夺，也没有到中国来建立一个王朝的野心。只因明朝那个皇帝（英宗）昏瞆胡涂，听信太监的话，才酿成所谓“土木之变”。于谦出来支撑危局，作了一系列的紧急措施，又击退了围攻北京的瓦剌兵，迫使也先知难而退，最后索性把俘虏去的皇帝也送回来了。总而言之，瓦剌部的入侵虽然一时形势非常严重，但因为于谦的应付得当，很快地把它挡回去了，所以后人对于谦的认识没有像对岳飞的那样深刻，而知道于谦的人也就比知道岳飞的人少得多了。
    但是，我们如果就具体情况作具体分析，那么于谦的功勋决不在岳飞之下。当五十万大军在土木堡溃散、皇帝被俘的消息一传到京师，胆小如鼠的侍讲徐珵之流都主张迁都，于谦坚决反对，主张立新君，修战备，表示“丧君有君，群臣辑睦，甲兵益多”，让也先无可要挟，更不能长驱南下。他亲自在北京德胜门外督战，跟也先相持至五日之久，终于把瓦剌兵给击退了。那时候于谦的心目中只有国家和人民，并没有把那给也先俘虏去的皇帝搁在心上。这是有事实可以证明的：也先围攻北京的时候，带了那个倒霉皇帝来，放在自己的兵营里，以为这样可以让于谦有所顾忌，不敢作猛烈的抵抗。但是于谦不管这些，下令用火炮轰击也先的兵营，打死打伤了几千瓦剌兵，也先的弟弟也给打死了。虽然也有人给于谦作辩解，说什么“先已遣谍探知英宗驻驾地距营远，故以火炮击也先营，死者数千人”（“明史考证”引章珝“琬琰录”）云云，但这是冬烘先生的看法和想法，他们不了解于谦是个民族英雄，仅仅把他看作朱明一姓的忠臣。
    于谦给英宗冤枉杀死以后，遗骸运归他的故乡（钱塘），葬西湖三台山下。过了两个世纪，清人入关，又出现了许多民族英雄，其中张苍水是抵抗到底，不屈而死的。他写出过这样的诗句：“国亡家破欲何之，西子湖头有我师：日月双悬于氏墓，乾坤半壁岳家祠……”结果张苍水求仁得仁，西湖上多了一个民族英雄之墓，跟岳坟、于坟鼎足而三。西湖有了这三个坟，不但为湖山生色，为民族增光，对于爱国主义教育也起了很大的作用。可惜解放以来，负文物管理之责的和负西湖园林管理之责的，只注意了岳坟和岳庙，而不注意于坟和张苍水坟，任其荒废，不加修葺。这是非常不对的。今年是于谦被杀五百周年，我们应该用各种方式来纪念他，写文章、做报告都可以。借纪念于谦来进行具体而深刻的爱国主义教育，并引起一般人学习祖国历史的兴趣；同时我们应该把于坟和张苍水坟整理一下，恢复它的原来样子。
