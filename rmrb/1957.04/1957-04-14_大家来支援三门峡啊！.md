    Everyone, Come Support the Sanmenxia!
    The Sanmenxia key water control project on the Yellow River has officially started construction.
    The Sanmenxia project is a crucial undertaking for harnessing and benefiting from the Yellow River while eliminating its harms. The flood control and power-generating dam and reservoir built at Sanmenxia will not only control 92% of the Yellow River's upstream water volume, intercepting extraordinary floods from the areas above Sanmenxia and sparing 80 million residents in Henan, Shandong, Hebei, Northern Jiangsu, and Northern Anhui from the threat of floods; but also irrigate 40 million mu of land in the lower reaches of the Yellow River, provide ample and inexpensive electricity for industry in the vicinity of Sanmenxia, and develop navigation on the Yellow River. The Sanmenxia project is so closely related to the development prospects of industry, agriculture, and transportation in China's Yellow River basin. How can the construction of this project not inspire and delight the people of the whole country!
    Before the start of the Sanmenxia project, thanks to the efforts of Chinese and foreign experts, especially the selfless assistance of Soviet experts, and the coordination and cooperation of relevant departments, the staff of the Yellow River Sanmenxia Engineering Bureau have already made significant achievements in construction preparation work, creating favorable conditions for smooth construction. However, to build a flood control and power-generating dam 840 meters long and about 110 meters high on a river known for its treacherousness, to cut off the raging Yellow River at its waist, one can imagine how complex the construction technology is and how much manpower, materials, and financial resources are required. In addition, the Sanmenxia construction site is located in a narrow canyon area, the construction site is limited, and because construction is inconvenient during the flood season, some large-scale projects must be completed within a short dry season. Thus, engineering requirements and natural conditions dictate that a highly mechanized construction method must be adopted here. Whether construction equipment and building materials can be supplied fully and on time according to specifications is the key to the smooth progress of the Sanmenxia project. When supplying equipment, the machinery industry sector should take these characteristics into account as much as possible; other parties should also pay attention to this when transporting manpower, materials, and financial support to the Sanmenxia construction site.
    After the official start of the Sanmenxia project, the construction site will need to gradually increase the number of cadres and workers of various trades. By the end of this year, the number of people gathered at the construction site will be tens of thousands. So many people are gathered here, and it will take about six years to complete the construction. Their livelihood supply is a very important issue. However, since Sanmenxia is located in a mountainous area far from the original city, there were not only no shops in the past, but even simple postal organizations, let alone other service industries. These problems must also be solved immediately.
    There are also projects such as the preparation for the establishment of affiliated enterprises, the construction of power transmission lines for the construction area, the construction of special railway and highway lines and steel frame bridges, and the search for underground water sources, all of which need to be closely coordinated with the construction progress of the main project, otherwise the progress of the entire project will be affected.
    In short, there will be many difficulties after the Sanmenxia project starts. To overcome these difficulties, we must first rely on the Yellow River Sanmenxia Engineering Bureau to implement the policy of running enterprises diligently and thriftily. We must strive to save where we can save; we should postpone what can be postponed until conditions permit; we should cut out what can be cut out from the construction projects; we should not order what can be solved with substitutes or other methods. However, since the Sanmenxia project is "starting from scratch," it cannot but require the support of all parts of the country. It requires more than 50 factories and mining enterprises in 22 industrial cities across the country to supply equipment and materials; it also requires the transfer of varying numbers of technical cadres and skilled workers from existing water conservancy and hydropower construction sites across the country; it requires the railway and transportation departments to build special railway lines, permanent highways, and bridges across the Yellow River; it requires the commercial departments to establish a commercial network in the industrial area to ensure the supply of staple and non-staple foods and daily necessities; it also requires the establishment of postal and telecommunications, banks, barber shops and other industries to serve the workers. It is hoped that all relevant parties will cooperate and actively take responsibility to provide strong support for these tasks.
    Since this project is being carried out within Henan Province, Henan's support tasks are particularly heavy. Henan not only has to mobilize a sufficient number of migrant workers and allocate a large amount of civilian building materials; but also needs to bear the main responsibility for the supply of non-staple foods and the opening up of transportation lines to facilitate the movement of personnel in the construction area. It is hoped that the party and government leading organs of Henan Province will have a comprehensive plan and mobilize the local people to ensure its realization.
    Harnessing the Yellow River and making it serve industrial and agricultural production is the long-cherished wish of the people of the whole country. Now, this task is being undertaken by our generation. The construction of the Sanmenxia project is the central link in realizing this task. At present, a group of engineering and technical personnel, workers, administrative managers, commercial and economic workers, medical workers, barbers and other service industry personnel, as well as a large number of migrant workers from all over the country, entrusted by the people of the whole country, are going to work at the Sanmenxia construction site. At the same time, more people across the country will be serving the Sanmenxia project directly or indirectly. We congratulate all comrades who directly or indirectly participate in the construction of the Sanmenxia project, and hope that they will carry forward the tradition of diligence, bravery, and hard work of our people, overcome all kinds of difficulties, and build the Sanmenxia project quickly, well, and economically.

### 大家来支援三门峡啊！

    大家来支援三门峡啊！
    黄河三门峡水利水利枢纽工程正式开始施工了。
    三门峡工程是对黄河除害兴利的关键工程。在三门峡修建的拦洪发电的大坝和水库，不仅可以控制黄河上游水量的92％，拦蓄三门峡以上地区的特大洪水，使河南、山东、河北、苏北、皖北等地八千万居民免除洪水的威胁；而且可以灌溉黄河下游四千万亩土地，可以为三门峡附近地区的工业提供充裕而廉价的电力，可以发展黄河上的航运。三门峡工程既是这样密切地关系着我国黄河流域的工业、农业和交通运输事业的发展前途，这项工程的兴建，怎能不叫全国人民欢欣鼓舞！
    三门峡工程开工以前，由于中外专家的努力，尤其是苏联专家的无私援助，加上各有关部门的配合协作，黄河三门峡工程局的职工们在施工准备工作方面已经取得了显著的成绩，给顺利施工创造了良好的条件。但是，这个工程要在一条以险恶著称的河流上，建成一座长达八百四十公尺、高约一百一十公尺的拦洪发电大坝，把凶猛的黄河拦腰切断，可想而知，它的施工技术多么复杂，需要多大的人力物力财力。加上三门峡工地又是处在一条狭窄的峡谷地带，施工场地受到限制，而且由于汛期施工不便，某些工作量很大的工程还必须争取在一个短短的枯水季节完工。这样，工程要求和自然条件，就决定了这里必须采取机械化程度较高的施工方法。施工设备和建筑材料能否按照规格充分而及时地供应，就成为三门峡工程能否顺利进行的关键。机械工业部门在供应设备时，应该尽量照顾到这些特点；其他各方面在输送人力、物力、财力支援三门峡工地的时候，也应该尽量注意到这一点。
    三门峡工程正式开工以后，工地上需要陆续增加许多干部和各个工种的工人。到今年年底，聚集在工地的人数将有数万。这么多人聚集在这里，要大约六年的时间才能施工完毕，他们的生活供应是一个很重要的问题。可是，由于三门峡处在一个距原有城市较远的山区，当地过去不仅没有商店，就是简单的邮政机构也没有，更不要说其他的服务性行业了。这些问题也必须马上解决。
    还有关于附属企业的筹建，工区用电输电线的架设，铁路公路专用线和钢架桥的建筑，以及寻找地下水源等工程，都需要和主体工程的建筑进度密切配合，否则就会影响整个工程的进度。
    总之，三门峡工程开工以后将有不少的困难。要克服这些困难，首先要依靠黄河三门峡工程局贯彻执行勤俭办企业的方针。可以节省的都要力求节省；可以缓办的就要推迟到有条件的时候再办；可以不办的就应该从建设项目中削掉；可以用代用品或用其他办法求得解决的就不必订购。但是，由于三门峡工程是“平地起家”，它不能不要求全国各方面的支援。它要求全国二十二个工业城市五十多个厂矿企业供应设备和器材；还要求从全国现有的各水利水力建筑工地抽调不同数目的技术干部和技术工人；它要求铁道和交通部门修建铁路专用线、永久性公路和横跨在黄河上的桥梁；它要求商业部门在工业区建立商业网，以保证主副食品和日用百货的供应；它还要求设立邮电、银行、理发等行业为职工服务。这许多工作，都希望有关的各方面分工合作，积极负责，大力给予支援。
    由于这项工程是在河南省境内进行的，河南省的支援任务就特别繁重。河南不仅要动员足够数量的民工，调拨大量的民用建筑材料；而且在副食品的供应，以及便利工区人员来往的交通线路的开辟等方面，都需要担负主要的责任。希望河南省的党政领导机关有一个全面的规划，并动员当地人民保证实现。
    治理黄河，使黄河为工农业生产服务，这是全国人民多年来的愿望。现在，这个任务由我们这一代担当起来了。三门峡工程的兴建，正是实现这个任务的中心环节。目前，全国各地将有一批工程技术人员、工人、行政管理人员、商业及经济工作人员、医务工作人员、理发等服务行业的人员，以及大批民工，受着全国人民的委托，到三门峡工地去工作。同时，全国将有更多的人在直接或间接地为三门峡工程服务。我们祝贺一切直接或间接参加三门峡工程建设的同志们，发扬我国人民勤劳勇敢、艰苦朴素的传统，战胜种种困难，把三门峡工程建设得又快又好又省。
