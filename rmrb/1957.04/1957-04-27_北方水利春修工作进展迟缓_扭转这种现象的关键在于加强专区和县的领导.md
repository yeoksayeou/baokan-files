　　(Our report) The spring repair work of farmland water conservancy in the north is progressing slowly. Relevant regions should grasp the leadership of the spring repair work and reverse this phenomenon as soon as possible.

　　According to the person in charge of the farmland water conservancy work of the Ministry of Water Conservancy: the projects of farmland water conservancy spring repair work that have been completed in the southern provinces can expand the irrigation area by more than 15 million mu. However, the spring repair work of farmland water conservancy in many areas of the north is progressing very slowly. In Heze Special Zone of Shandong Province, only 2% of the planned farmland water conservancy projects for this year were completed by early April. In Shangqiu Special Zone of Henan Province, only 0.4% of the planned well drilling and renovation of shallow wells were completed by the end of March. Many areas in Hebei Province have not taken action.

　　The responsible comrade then analyzed the reasons for the slow progress in the northern region: mainly because some areas suffered from waterlogging disasters last year, and the newly built irrigation projects have not yet played a role. The technical guidance work in some areas cannot keep up with the development of the situation, so some negative emotions have arisen and have not been corrected in time. This year, there was another spring cold, and the construction of water conservancy projects started later, resulting in the phenomenon of squeezing out water conservancy construction work during spring plowing.

　　The threat of drought in the northern region has always been serious. It also accounts for a large proportion of the national task of expanding the irrigation area this year. If we do not seize the most favorable time from now until the summer harvest to actively build water conservancy, it will directly affect this year's bumper harvest of agriculture.

　　The responsible comrade emphatically pointed out: The key to the completion of farmland water conservancy tasks lies in leadership. At present, the focus of leadership lies in special zones and counties. Because the provinces have already solved the principled problems in the work, the specific publicity and education, mobilizing the masses, raising funds and materials, arranging labor, and guiding construction must rely on the special zones and counties to strengthen leadership.

　　Finally, the responsible comrade said: In leading the development of farmland water conservancy work, pay attention to the following issues: First, the northern region should pay special attention to strengthening the renovation of shallow wells and repairing projects to consolidate the achievements of water conservancy construction last year. Second, the potential of existing irrigation facilities is great, and attention should be paid to giving play to its role. Third, in order to overcome the contradiction of large spring repair tasks and short time, in general areas, construction can continue after spring sowing and rice transplanting, seizing the gaps in agricultural activities. Fourth, it is necessary to prevent the phenomenon of rushing for work and speed, neglecting project quality and construction safety.

### 北方水利春修工作进展迟缓  扭转这种现象的关键在于加强专区和县的领导

    北方水利春修工作进展迟缓
    扭转这种现象的关键在于加强专区和县的领导
    本报讯　北方农田水利的春修工作迄今进展迟缓，有关地区应抓紧春修工作的领导，及早扭转这种现象。
    据水利部农田水利工作方面负责人说：当前南方各省农田水利春修工作已经完工的工程，约可扩大灌溉面积一千五百多万亩。但是，北方许多地区农田水利春修工作进展很慢。山东省菏泽专区，到4月上旬只完成今年兴修农田水利计划的2％，河南省商丘专区到3月底只完成打井和改造浅井计划的0.4％，河北省有不少地区没有行动起来。
    这位负责同志接着分析了北方地区工作进展迟缓的原因：主要是去年有些地区遭到水涝灾害，新建的灌溉工程还没有发挥作用，有些地区技术指导工作赶不上形势的发展，因此而产生的一些消极情绪，没有及时纠正；今年又遇春寒，水利工程开工较迟，以致在春耕中发生了挤掉兴修水利工作的现象。
    北方地区历年干旱威胁比较严重，在今年全国扩大灌溉面积任务当中，又占很大的比重，如果不抓紧从现在到夏收这一段最有利的时间，积极兴修水利，就会直接影响到今年的农业大丰收。
    这位负责同志着重指出：农田水利任务完成的好坏，关键在于领导。而在目前，领导的重点则在于专区和县。因为各省大都已经解决了工作当中的原则问题，至于具体的宣传教育、发动群众、筹集资金物料、安排劳动力以及指导施工等，必须靠专区和县加强领导。
    最后，这位负责同志说：在领导开展农田水利工作中，要注意以下几个问题：第一、北方地区应特别注意加强改造浅井和整修工程，巩固去年水利建设的成绩。第二、现有灌溉设施潜力很大，应当注意发挥它的作用。第三、为克服春修任务大、时间短的矛盾，一般地区，可以在春播和插秧以后，抓住农事活动间隙，继续施工。第四、必须防止因赶工图快、忽视工程质量和施工安全的现象。
