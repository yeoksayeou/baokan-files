Discussion on What Unreasonable Bonuses Exist in Enterprises? How Should Unreasonable Bonuses Be Treated?

    Unsuitable Material Rewards Should Be Rectified
    I think it is absolutely necessary and timely to start the discussion on "What unreasonable bonuses exist in enterprises? How should unreasonable bonuses be treated?" I believe that appropriate material rewards can stimulate production and motivate employees to complete national construction plans. However, the current abuse of material rewards and its bad influence are indeed a widespread and serious problem.
    The number of reward categories in many factories and mines is astonishing. According to incomplete statistics from five factories of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, including the Ironmaking Plant, the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant, the Refractory Materials Plant, the Medium-sized Plant, and the Small-sized Plant, there are nearly forty types of similar but different names for rewards. In the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel, almost all production activities have rewards. There are separate rewards for fast charging and fast steelmaking, as well as for maintaining the furnace body, furnace top, and the situation in front of the furnace. Even cleaning the roof and replacing the water jacket accessories of the open hearth furnace have rewards. Workers at the No. 1 Primary Rolling Mill receive awards for completing hourly quotas or (eight-hour) output separately. If all three shifts perform well, a collective award is also given. Even when the production plan is not completed, some workers can still receive large bonuses.
    The reward methods are unreasonable. The amount of awards for full-time cadres is higher than that for workers. The Ministry of Railways explicitly stipulates that bonuses can be obtained upon completion of the task. The factory director's bonus rate is 25%-40% of his monthly salary, while the worker's is only 10%-20%, a huge difference. The phenomenon of egalitarianism is also serious in rewards. As long as the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant completes or exceeds the planned value of goods produced, regardless of the position of the staff member and regardless of the quality of work, everyone receives a bonus. Except for individual departments, there is no evaluation; the accounting department and the workshop accountants distribute the bonuses according to the total reward coefficient and wage standards.
    Due to the abuse and unreasonableness of the reward system, it not only causes economic losses to the state (Anshan Iron and Steel spent more than 1.7 million yuan on bonuses from the wage fund alone last year), but also reduces the effect of the rewards. Some enterprises regard rewards as a panacea to replace political and ideological work. As a result, it has fostered an economic point of view among workers. Some workers are picky about production tasks, refusing to do tiring work or work without bonuses. Some individual workers have even put forward the slogan of "seven no's": no odd jobs, no work without quotas, no tight quotas, no new products, etc.
    "How should unreasonable bonuses be treated?" I disagree with what Comrade Tiangong said in the People's Daily on April 21st, page 2: "Appropriately relax the scope of issuing bonuses" and "Since the leaders have put in a lot of effort, it is reasonable for them to receive more bonuses than ordinary employees." I believe that the scope of bonuses should be reduced, and the standard of the award coefficient should be lowered, especially reducing and lowering the award range and coefficient standards for full-time cadres and responsible cadres, making them lower than ordinary production workers. I suggest that the labor and wage departments quickly rectify the inappropriate material reward system.

    They Returned the Bonuses
    Our factory recently received a bonus of 6,310 yuan for the successful trial production of pre-stressed beams and asbestos cement pipes.
    The list of technical personnel who won the awards was posted at the factory gate: Engineer He Shuliang 300 yuan, Engineer Yang Xizhen 200 yuan, Drafter Tong Enshan 50 yuan... The list of award winners was also posted at the entrance of the T-beam workshop: Workshop Director Zhang Yuzhen 110 yuan, Carpenter ××× 5 yuan. Most of the award winners were very happy, but among these award winners, there were three workshop representatives who "piggybacked" and returned the bonuses to the factory director in full, and attached a letter expressing their dissatisfaction with the award. The gist of the letter was: Although the leading cadres put in a lot of effort when completing this task, the workers also contributed a lot, so why are more than 100 workers awarded a total of 80 yuan, while an engineer gets 300 yuan alone?
    It turned out that after the factory received the award notice, it subjectively distributed the 6,000 yuan bonus without serious discussion with the masses. Workers in Guo Hongen's team said: "Giving us an 80 yuan bonus is like scolding us."
    What good can such rewards do?

    Cannot be Broadly Criticized
    After reading the article "A Communist Party Member's Extra Income," we feel that it cannot be broadly said that Comrade Yin Yonglin should not receive extra wages. We believe that the part he exceeded because "he processed fewer varieties and larger batches this month" should be paid according to state regulations. If his apprentice is still unable to work independently, and the production is exceeded because the apprentice participated in some auxiliary labor, he should also receive the extra wages earned in this situation. Of course, it is inappropriate to receive extra wages because the time quota is set conservatively. After the quota is determined, the production conditions change during the production process, and the quota should also be changed accordingly. "Three times the time for copying the meter was miscalculated, and another process—milling grooves—originally milled four times, but now a different milling cutter is used, and it only needs to be milled once." Since the production conditions have changed for the better, it should be proposed to revise the quota. However, in this case, Comrade Yin Yonglin did not do so, which shows that his awareness is not high enough.

### 企业里哪些奖金不合理？怎样对待不合理的奖金？

    企业里哪些奖金不合理？怎样对待不合理的奖金？
    不适当的物质奖励应当整顿
    我觉得，现在展开“企业里哪些奖金不合理？怎样对待不合理的奖金？”的讨论，是完全必要的，适时的。我认为适当的物质奖励，可以刺激生产，推动职工去完成国家建设计划；但是，目前物质奖励之滥，影响之坏，确实是个普遍严重的问题。
    不少厂矿奖励名目之多，是惊人的。据鞍山钢铁公司的炼铁厂、第一炼钢厂、耐火材料厂、中型厂和小型厂等五个厂的不完全统计，就有近四十多种同类而不同名称的奖励。鞍钢第一炼钢厂几乎所有的生产活动都有奖。快速装料、快速炼钢各有各的奖，维护好炉体、炉顶、前情也各有各的奖，连清扫房盖，更换平炉附件水套也都有奖。第一初轧厂的工人，完成小时定额或（八小时）产量都分别发奖，三班都好，还发给集体奖，在生产计划完不成的情况下，有些工人仍然可以拿到大量奖金。
    奖励办法不合理。脱产干部的得奖额比工人得奖额高。铁道部明文规定，完成任务就可得奖，厂长得奖率为其本人月工资的25％—40％，而工人只得10％—20％，相差悬殊。奖励中，平均主义现象也很严重，太原重型机器厂只要全厂完成或超额完成了商品产值计划，不管是什么岗位上的工作人员，不论工作好坏，一律发给奖金。除个别科室外，也不进行评比，一律由会计科和车间的核算员根据总的奖励系数，按工资标准分发。
    由于奖励制度的滥和不合理，不仅是在经济上给国家造成了损失，（鞍钢去年仅从工资基金中支出的奖金就达一千七百多元。）而且降低了奖励的作用。有的企业把奖励当成万灵药膏，用以代替政治思想工作。结果，滋长了工人中的经济观点，有的工人在接受生产任务时挑肥拣瘦，累人的工作不干，没有奖金不干。个别工人甚至提出零活不干，无定额不干，定额紧不干，新产品不干等“七不干”的口号。
    “怎样对待不合理的奖金？”我不同意4月21日人民日报二版上天工同志的文章中所说的：“适当放宽一些发放奖金的面”，
  “领导人既然出力不小，比一般职工多拿些奖金也是合情合理”的说法。我以为，应当缩小奖金的面，降低得奖系数标准，特别是缩小和降低脱产干部、负责干部的得奖面和得奖系数标准，使之低于一般生产工人。我建议劳动工资部门，赶快整顿不适当的物质奖励制度。

    他们把奖金退回来了
    我们厂最近因为试制予施应力梁和石棉水泥管成功，得到了六千三百一十元的奖金。
    工厂的大门口贴上了得奖的技术人员名单：工程师何叔良三百元、工程师杨希震二百元、绘图员佟恩山五十元……丁字梁车间的门口，也贴着得奖人的名单：车间主任张玉镇一百一十元、木工×××五元。得到奖金的人大多数很高兴，可是就在这些得奖人当中，却有三个“借光”得奖的车间代表，把奖金如数退给了厂长，并且附来一封信，对这次评奖表示不满。这封信的大意是：领导干部在完成这项任务的时候，虽然费了很大心血，但是工人也出了不少力量，那么为什么一百多个工人总共奖给八十元，而工程师一个人就得三百元呢？
    原来工厂接到奖励的通知以后，没有认真地经过群众讨论，就主观地把六千多元奖金发下去了。郭洪恩小组的工人这样说：“给我们八十元的奖金，简直跟骂人一样。”
    像这样的奖励，能起到什么好作用呢？

    不能笼统批评
    读了“一个共产党员的额外收入”一文后，我们觉得，不能笼统地说殷永林同志不应当拿超额工资。我们以为，他因为“这个月给他加工的品种少、批量大”而超额的部分，按照国家规定，应当拿；如果他的徒弟还不能独立工作，而由于徒弟参加了部分辅助劳动，使生产超额了，在这种情况下得的超额工资，他也应当拿。当然，因为工时定额订得保守而拿超额工资是不应当的。定额确定后，生产过程中生产条件有改变，定额也应当随之改变。“多算了三次拷表的时间，另一道工序——铣槽，原来铣四刀，现在换了一种铣刀，只铣一刀”了，生产条件改变了，好了，应当提出来修订定额。但是，在这种情况下，殷永林同志没有这么作，这是他觉悟不够高的表现。
