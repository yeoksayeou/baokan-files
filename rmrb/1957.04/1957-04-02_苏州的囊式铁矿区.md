    Suzhou's Pocket-like Iron Ore Area
    Xinhua
    In Wu County, near Suzhou, there is a Yangshan Mining Company. It originally mined white clay (kaolin). When the miners were digging for white clay, they often had to dig out a lot of heavy, dark red "stones." In the past, these "stones" were discarded and no one cared about them. Later, it was discovered that this was iron ore, and after testing, it was found to be high-grade ore with a very high iron content. Subsequently, iron ore was also discovered in the Tanshan area of Jilong Township, Wu County. According to Wang Zhenshen, a geological consultant engineer from the Suzhou Heavy Industry Bureau, this is a very interesting "pocket-like" mining area that has not been seen in China before. What is buried underground is not a large area of iron ore deposit, but many "pockets." The "pockets" vary in size, and the amount of iron ore stored varies. After one "pocket" is emptied, another "pocket" has to be found to get iron ore. Although it has not yet been determined whether the iron ore reserves here are worth mining, more than 1,000 tons of iron ore have been extracted just by tentatively "picking" four "pockets." Moreover, the white clay and red soil surrounding the ore are also useful industrial raw materials and building materials.
    As early as the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods more than two thousand years ago, the State of Wu, whose territory was in the Jiangsu area, had a fairly developed iron smelting industry. Suzhou was one of the iron-producing areas at that time. According to legend, Gan Jiang forged the two famous swords "Gan Jiang" and "Mo Ye" in Xiangmentang, Suzhou. At the same time, the King of Wu also established a smelting city in Chaotiangong, Nanjing, to smelt iron on a large scale. It is said that at that time, there were bellows furnaces that required 300 people to operate, which shows the scale of iron smelting at that time. It was not until the Tang Dynasty that the smelting industry was concentrated in Pengcheng (now Xuzhou). By the Song Dynasty, Liguo in Xuzhou became the national center for iron ore mining and smelting.
    Not long ago, the Suzhou Heavy Industry Bureau sent a special working group to the Suzhou Agricultural Machinery Factory to smelt pig iron from Yangshan ore using relatively simple methods. The iron content of the ore is 50%, and the quality of the iron is very good.
    Just when the national construction is developing rapidly and the supply of steel is tight, they discovered iron ore and trial-smelted pig iron, which provides a way for Suzhou's machinery factories to obtain materials locally and overcome the difficulty of insufficient raw materials.

    苏州的囊式铁矿区
  　新华
    在苏州市附近的吴县境内有个阳山采矿公司，那儿原本是开采白泥（瓷土）的，矿工们在开采白泥时，常常要挖出许多沉重的、暗红色的“石头”，早先，那种“石头”被弃置一旁，无人过问，后来发现这是铁矿石，经过化验，还是含铁量很高的富矿石。随后，在吴县纪龙乡潭山地区又发现了铁矿。据苏州市重工业局地质顾问工程师王臻善判断：这里是一个很有趣的、在国内尚未见到过的“囊式”矿区。埋藏在地下的不是成大片的铁矿床，而是许多“口袋”。“口袋”大小不同，储存铁石多少不一，一个“口袋”掏空了，要找到另一个“口袋”才有铁矿石。现在虽然还没有查明这里的铁矿蕴藏量是否有开采价值，可是，仅仅试“掏”了四个“口袋”，就取出了一千多吨铁矿石。而且包围着矿石的白泥和红土，也都是有用的工业原料和建筑材料。
    远在两千多年以前的春秋战国时代，疆土在江苏地区的吴国就有了相当发达的炼铁工业。苏州，是当时的产铁地之一，据传说，干将就是在苏州相门塘铸成了“干将”、“莫邪”两把著名的宝剑的。同时，吴王还在现今的南京朝天宫那儿设了冶城，大量炼铁，相传当时就有了需要三百人才能开动的鼓风炉，可以想见当时的炼铁规模。只是在唐朝时代，冶铸业才集中到了彭城（即今徐州），到了宋朝时代，徐州利国就成了全国采铁、炼铁的中心了。
    不久以前，苏州市重工业局派出专门的工作组在苏州农业机械厂以比较简单的方法，把阳山的矿石炼出了生铁。矿石的含铁量有50％，而且铁的质量很好。
    正当国家建设飞跃发展、钢铁供应呈现紧张现象的时候，他们发现了铁矿并且试炼出了生铁，这就给苏州市机械工厂带来了就地取材、克服原料不足的困难的办法。
