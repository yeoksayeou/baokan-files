    The Sea Cow
    Feng Yidai
    The night I arrived at the seaside, according to the sanatorium's rules, I had to be in bed by 9:30 PM. But once I lay down, I couldn't fall asleep. For years, I had cultivated the habit of going to bed late, sometimes even enjoying a few pages of a book before drifting off to sleep. However, that afternoon the head nurse laid down three rules for me: first, go to bed early; second, read less, especially no reading before bed; third… So, lying in bed, I could only look at the moonlight filtering through the curtains, those shimmering silver rays.
    The wind picked up outside, followed by the sound of waves from the sea. Gradually, amidst the wind and the waves, I heard a sorrowful cry, "Ooo… ooo… ooo." With intervals, this sound came over and over again, carried by the wind and the waves.
    This mournful cry, as if from the depths of despair, stirred many imaginings within me. "Ooo… ooo… ooo," I tossed and turned until the sky began to show a hint of dawn.
    Early in the morning, when the attendant saw me on the veranda and asked if I had slept well, I could only smile wryly and ask her what sound had disturbed my dreams. Her answer was simple: "Sea cow." Her expression seemed to tell me that this was a question that didn't need asking, but her words only increased my curiosity.
    I went for a walk by the sea. The wind was calm, the waves were still, and the rising sun reflected on the water, making it look like a piece of colorful, fragmented brocade. I ran into the old man who watched over the beach, whom I had met the previous afternoon, and asked him what the wailing sound I had heard last night was.
    He hesitated for a moment and said vaguely, "A sea cow, I suppose."
    I asked, "What is a sea cow?"
    He said, "Let me tell you a story! Before the war, there was a pair of sea cows in the sea. They guarded the large reef at the bottom of the ocean, keeping passing ships from getting too close. One day, the Japanese soldiers came, and they managed to capture one of them and take her back to Japan. The one that was left behind would cry mournfully every night, calling for his mate, hoping for her return. The darker and stormier the night, the louder his cries, making it impossible for you to sleep well..."
    After speaking, he suddenly burst out laughing, then hobbled towards the shore.
    I listened blankly to his words. I never imagined such a tragic story would elicit laughter from him. I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease in my heart.
    At breakfast, I told the story to the people at my table, and none of them could help but laugh. It turned out that the sea cow's cries were simply the sound of buoys installed on the hidden reefs in the sea, emitting a "woo-woo" sound in a certain direction of the wind to warn passing ships. The stronger the wind and waves at sea, the more mournful the sound.
    The story the old man told was clearly fabricated by someone. Even if it was made up, I felt it contained an unspoken emotion. I suddenly remembered the cold glint in the old man's eyes when he mentioned the Japanese soldiers.
    Naturally, the people at my table saw me as a joke, but I couldn't laugh. Although the story was just a legend, this beautiful land had, after all, experienced many years of war, and the memories of those scattered and lost loved ones still remained in the hearts of the survivors.
    At night, whenever the wind and waves outside the window carried the mournful cries, I would always say to myself: "Poor sea cow is calling for his mate again." As the days went by, I became accustomed to the sorrowful sound. When I didn't hear it, I even felt a sense of loneliness.

    海牛
    冯亦代
    我到达海滨的那天晚上，按照疗养院的规矩，九点半钟一定要上床睡觉，等到一躺下来，却怎么也睡不着。多少年来已经养成了迟睡的习惯，有时还喜欢在合眼前翻上几页书，才迷迷糊糊地睡去。可是这天下午护士长就对我约法三章：一要早睡，二要少念书，特别是睡前不许看书，三要……于是躺在床上，便只能望望从窗帘后面透进来的月色，那一丝一缕银白耀眼的光。
    屋子外面起风了，跟着是海上的涛声，逐渐在风声和涛音里，我听到了一声凄切的呼喊，呜……呜……呜。隔着一定的间歇，这声音一次又一次地随着风涛声吹过来。
    由于这凄切得宛如绝望的呼唤，使我引起了许多遐想。呜……呜……呜，我一直辗转反侧到天边出现了鱼肚色。
    一清早，当护理员在洋台上看见我，问我昨宵是否安睡时，我只能苦笑一下，回问她，这扰我清梦的究竟是什么声音？她的回答很简单：“海牛。”她说话的神情，似乎告诉我这本来就是个用不着问的问题，可是她的话却更增加了我的好奇。
    我到海边散步去了。风平浪静，初升的朝日映在海上，眼前像是铺上了一块多彩的碎锦。我遇上了前一天下午刚认识的那位看守海滨浴场的老人，便问他，我昨晚听得一声声的呜咽，究竟是什么？
    他迟疑了一下，含糊地说：“海牛呗。”
    我问：“海牛是什么呢？”
    他说：“我给你讲个故事吧！抗战以前，海上有一对海牛，他们守护着海底的大礁，不让行驶的船只走近。有一天，日本兵来了，他们好容易才捉住一只，把她带回日本去。留下的一只，一到夜晚，便凄切呜咽地喊着，喊着他的同伴，喊着她盼她回来。越是月黑风高的夜晚，他的喊声，也越不让你好好地睡去。……”
    说完，他突然大声地笑了起来，接着便蹒跚地向岸上走去。
    我痴痴地听了他的话，这样一个悲惨的故事，竟想不到会引起他的大笑来。我禁不住自己心头的悒悒。
    吃早饭时，我把这个故事告诉给同桌的人，他们听了也没有一个不笑的。原来海牛的喊叫，只是装置在海里暗礁上的声标，迎着一定的风向，发出呜呜的声音来警告来往的船只，海上的风涛越大，它的声音也越凄厉。
    老人讲的故事，显然是一位好事的人编造的。即使是编的吧，我总觉得这里面含着一种没有说出来的感情。我突然记起老人提到日本兵时，那双老眼里透露出来的一股森冷的眼光。
    自然同桌的人把我也看成是个笑话，我却笑不出来。虽然故事只是个传说，在这块美丽的土地上，毕竟经历过多年的战乱，那些流离失散了的亲人们的记忆，到如今还保留在余生者的心里。
    夜晚，只要窗外的风涛夹着那声声呜咽飘来时，我总是对自己说：可怜的海牛又在招唤他的同伴了。日子一多，我也习惯于这凄切的声音了，偶然听不见时，反而频添一些寂寞之感。
