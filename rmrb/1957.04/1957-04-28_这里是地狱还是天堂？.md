    Is This Hell or Paradise?
    In February of this year, New York newspapers published a tragic story about the complete demise of the Kenycki family. The news reported that Mr. and Mrs. Kenycki had hanged their only young daughter in their house before jumping together from the fourteenth floor and committing suicide. Police believed that their fall was due to "long-term malnutrition." Kenycki had graduated from the University of Pennsylvania and obtained a bachelor's degree in economics. However, he could not find a stable job for a long time and did not have enough income to support his family of three.
    In the United States, Native Americans are treated as exhibits and confined to reservations. Diseases and hunger lead to their constant deaths. According to investigations into the Babago and Yevaha tribes, the infant mortality rate is 50%. The average lifespan of Native Americans in the United States is seventeen years.
    The "New York Post" reported that the New York State Legislature recently re-enacted laws to deal with "dangerous elements," greatly expanding the scope of "security investigations." The report said: "Scientists who teach paleontology are also subject to security investigations because they know where caves are located that can hide things—perhaps politicians."

    这里是地狱还是天堂？
    今年2月间纽约报纸上登载了一条关于凯尼基全家惨毙的消息。消息中说，凯尼基夫妇在房子里缢死了他们的唯一幼女之后，两个人一道从十四层楼上跳下自杀了。警方认为，他们坠楼的原因是由于“长期营养不良”。凯尼基曾在宾夕法尼亚大学毕业，而且取得了经济学学士的学位。但是他长期找不到固定的职业，没有足够的收入来维持他一家三口的生活。
    在美国，印第安人是被当作陈列品圈在保留地区里的。疾病和饥饿的袭击使他们不断死亡。根据对巴巴格和耶瓦哈两个部落的调查，儿童死亡率是50％。美国的印第安人的平均寿命是十七岁。
    美国“纽约邮报”报道，纽约州议会最近重新制订了对付“危险分子”的法律，大大地扩大了进行“安全调查”的范围。报道说：“教授古生物科学的科学家们也受到安全调查，因为他们知道可以藏东西——也许可以藏政治家——的洞穴在什么地方。”
