Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, April 3rd: The Governor of Kerala has requested E.M.S. Namboodiripad, Chairman of the Communist Party of India (CPI) Kerala State Assembly Party, to submit his cabinet list on April 3rd. The new ministers of the Kerala government will be sworn in on April 5th.

The Governor of Kerala appointed a representative of Anglo-Indian residents to the State Assembly without consulting the new Kerala government. This increases the number of seats in the State Assembly to 127, of which Communists and independent supporters of the Communists hold 65 seats.

The leaders of the Praja Socialist Party (PSP) of Kerala rejected the Communist Party's proposal to welcome the PSP to participate in the Kerala government.

Reports indicate that there are currently efforts to unite all opposition parties to form a united front in the State Assembly to oppose the Communist government. Communist Party General Secretary Ajoy Ghosh criticized the Kerala Governor's practice of appointing a representative of Anglo-Indian residents without consulting the new government at a press conference in Delhi on March 31st. He hoped that the relationship between the Kerala Governor and the new government would be based on "mutual trust and harmony."

    印共在喀拉拉邦组织政府
    新部长们将在明天宣誓就职
    据新华社新德里3日电　印度喀拉拉邦长已经要求印度共产党喀拉拉邦议会党团主席南布迪里巴德在4月3日提出他的内阁名单。喀拉拉邦政府的新部长们将要在4月5日宣誓就职。
    喀拉拉邦长没有同新的喀拉拉邦政府磋商就任命了一名英印混血族居民的代表参加邦议会。这样，邦议会的席位就增加到了一百二十七席，其中共产党人和支持共产党的独立人士占六十五席。
    喀拉拉邦的人民社会党领袖们拒绝了共产党所提出的欢迎人民社会党参加喀拉拉邦政府的建议。
    有消息说，目前有人在活动，要联合一切反对党派在邦议会中结成联合阵线，反对共产党政府。共产党总书记高士3月31日在德里的记者招待会上批评了喀拉拉邦长不经过同新政府磋商就任命英印混血族居民代表的那种作法。他希望，喀拉拉邦长和新政府之间的关系建立在“互相信任和融洽”的基础上。
