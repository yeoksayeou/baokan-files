    No More Being Indecisive, Dedicating My Life to the Countryside
    Yi Zhengfu, Secretary of the Communist Party Branch and Director of Xinquan Cooperative, Xinquan Township, Pingxiang County, Jiangxi Province

    Using the exemplary deeds of Guan Musheng, director of the Changfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Hubei Province, as a mirror to examine myself, I feel very sad. I have discovered that deep down in my heart, many dirty things have already taken root.

    I was once uneasy about working in the countryside. Seeing that comrades who originally worked with me had all been transferred to higher positions, while I alone remained in the countryside, I was very unhappy. I was unwilling to work in the countryside, mainly because I felt it was a "hard job." My work is in the mountains, and I often have to climb over hills and valleys. I thought working in the city would be much more comfortable.

    Comrade Guan Musheng's exemplary deeds made me suddenly realize my errors. How can it not be heartbreaking that the idea of seeking comfort has grown in someone like me? I was born into a poor peasant family. My father died when I was fourteen, and I started chopping wood to sell and working as a long-term laborer for others when I was fifteen. I lived such a miserable and difficult life, without support or sustenance, for more than twenty years. Today, I am working for the revolution, and my life is many times better than in the past. In recent years, our cooperative has undergone earth-shattering changes. Grain production has increased year after year, and 90% of the cooperative members have increased their income. Last year, grain production per mu increased by more than 21% compared to the previous year. The cooperative has built several large ponds and canals, guaranteeing irrigation for a large area. Before liberation, 40% of the people in our cooperative had no food to eat, no clothes to wear, and no houses, working as long-term laborers for landlords year after year. After joining the advanced cooperative, these people have all become households with surplus grain. Comparing today's life with the life in the old society, it is truly like heaven and hell, a world of difference. However, after I started working, I did not pay attention to transforming my thinking well. The suffering I experienced in the past has gradually faded in my mind, and the desire for comfort has gradually increased. If I don't give myself a severe warning, there is a danger of "forgetting my roots" if this continues to develop.

    Our cooperative is located in the old revolutionary base area. In the past, during those cruel struggles against the enemy, many comrades of our Party persisted in the struggle despite numerous difficulties, and some even gave their precious lives, in order to enable the people to live a happy life. I remember very clearly that labor model Comrade Yi Biao once said to me with tears in his eyes: "In the 16th and 17th years of the Republic of China, my uncle was a veteran soldier in this area. At that time, we were surrounded by reactionaries during the day and dared not work. We had to hide and hold meetings and write things late at night. Later, he was captured by the Kuomintang reactionaries, who tortured him severely, forcing him to reveal the secrets of the Party. He fainted several times, but the Kuomintang never got anything out of him. Finally, at the execution ground, he still shouted 'Long live the Chinese Communist Party!'" Revolutionary martyrs were not afraid of all hardships and difficulties and did not hesitate to sacrifice their lives for the interests of the people and the cause of the Party. I am also a Communist Party member. Our conditions today are much better than theirs at that time. Should I retreat from the current small difficulties and hardships? Absolutely not. I must inherit and carry forward the revolutionary traditions of the martyrs and dedicate my whole body and mind to the cause of the Party. I have made up my mind to get rid of indecisiveness and dedicate my life to the countryside; and I will also learn Guan Musheng's methods of leading production.

    不再三心二意，在农村中干到老
    江西省萍乡县新泉乡中共分支书记兼新泉社主任　易正福
    把湖北省长风农业社主任官木生的模范事迹当作一面镜子，对照检查我自己，心里感到很难过，我发现在自己内心深处，已经有了许多肮脏的东西。
    我曾经不安心农村工作，看到原来和我一起工作的同志都上调了，独有我留在乡下，我很不高兴。我不愿意在农村工作，主要是觉得这是“苦差事”。我的工作在山区，经常要爬山越岭。我认为在城市工作要舒服得多。
    官木生同志的模范事迹使我猛省过来。在我这样一个人身上滋长了贪图安逸的思想，怎不令人痛心呢？我出身在一个贫农的家里，十四岁时就死了父亲，十五岁时开始砍柴卖和替人家打长工。一个人无依无靠，无穿无吃，这样苦难辛酸的日子，一直过了二十多年。今天，我是在为革命工作，生活比起过去不知道要好了多少倍。这几年我们社里已经起了翻天覆地的变化。粮食产量一年一年增加，全社90％的社员增加了收入。去年每亩粮食产量，比前年增产21％以上。全社已经修了几个大塘和水圳，保证了大面积的灌溉。解放前我们社里40％的人没有饭吃，没有衣穿，没有房屋，长年替地主作长工，入了高级社以后，这些人已经全部变成了余粮户。拿今天的生活和旧社会的生活来比，那真是一个天堂，一个地狱，相差太远了。可是，我自己参加工作以后，没有注意很好地改造自己的思想。我过去受过的痛苦在自己的观念上一天一天地淡薄起来，贪图安逸的想法倒是渐渐增多了。如果再不对自己狠狠地敲一下警钟，发展下去，就有“忘本”的危险。
    我们这个社在老革命根据地。在过去那些残酷的对敌斗争的年代，我们党的许多同志为了使人民能过上幸福的生活，排除重重困难坚持了斗争，有些人还付出了自己宝贵的生命。我记得很清楚，劳动模范易彪同志曾经流着眼泪对我说：在民国十六、七年，我叔父是这个地方的老战士。那时，白天受着反动派的包围，不敢工作，等到夜深人静了，才躲着开会，写东西。后来他被国民党反动派抓住了，并严刑拷打他，逼迫他暴露党的秘密。他几次昏过去了，国民党始终没有从他口里得到什么。最后，在刑场上，他还高呼“中国共产党万岁！”。革命先烈为了人民的利益、党的事业，不怕一切艰苦困难，不惜牺牲自己的生命。我也是一个共产党员。我们今天的条件比他们那时好得太多了，难道对目前这一点点困难和艰苦就退缩吗？决不能够。我一定要继承和发扬先烈的革命传统，把整个身心献给党的事业。我已下决心要去掉三心二意，在农村中干到老；并且要学习官木生领导生产的方法。
