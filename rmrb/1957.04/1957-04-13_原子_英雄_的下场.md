    The Fate of an Atomic "Hero"

    In late March, police authorities in Texas, USA, arrested a man who broke into a post office to rob it. The criminal turned out to be Major Eatherly, an American Air Force "hero" from World War II who directly participated in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

    According to the American magazine "Newsweek," twelve years ago, Eatherly was one of the most prominent pilots in the United States. He was strong, his flying skills were considered to be at their peak, he was carefree and cheerful, and American intelligence agencies had given him a good evaluation in an "extremely strict loyalty assessment." Because of these conditions, Eatherly and four others were selected to carry out the first atomic bombing mission. Eatherly served as the captain of an aircraft named "Straight Flush."

    On August 6, 1945, Eatherly piloted "Straight Flush" along with three other aircraft to fly over Japan for pre-bombing reconnaissance. He found the bombing conditions in Hiroshima "suitable," so he flew back to the designated location to guide the aircraft carrying the first atomic bomb to drop it on Hiroshima. After the explosion, he also reconnoitered the results of the bombing over Hiroshima. A few days later, Eatherly flew to Nagasaki to perform the same mission!

    For carrying out these heinous crimes, the U.S. government awarded Eatherly the "Distinguished Flying Cross" and other awards. He was hailed as an Air Force "hero" and received a pension of $237 per month after retiring.

    However, the U.S. government's "rewards" could not withstand the torment of his conscience. The tragic scenes of hundreds of thousands of innocent victims in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the roar of people all over the world against atomic weapons, made Eatherly restless day and night, and he eventually became mentally disturbed. After returning home from retirement, he often shouted in the middle of the night: "Bail out! Bail out!" He dreamed that he was piloting a plane over Tokyo and was shot down, sitting in a burning plane waiting to die. He was hospitalized from 1950, but medicine could not atone for his sins. His mental illness became more and more serious, and he repeatedly ran out of the hospital to commit crimes. His wife also divorced him. Last fall, he was interrogated by the court for 90 days for being involved in a robbery. He said in court: "I don't know why I did such a thing. I don't need money."

    Eatherly's fate is reminiscent of former U.S. Secretary of Defense Forrestal, who committed suicide by jumping off a building. These are two typical examples of mental derangement that have appeared in the atomic bomb hysteria in the United States. One was driven mad by the atomic war he was keen to plan, resulting in jumping off a building; the other was driven to serve as a tool for the large-scale slaughter of human beings, "not knowing why," and suffered the condemnation of his conscience and went mad. Although the circumstances of these two people are different, the end result is the same. This cannot but be a powerful warning to those adventurers in the United States who are still frantically preparing for atomic war. (Ping)

### 原子“英雄”的下场

    原子“英雄”的下场
    3月下旬，美国得克萨斯州的警察当局逮捕了一个闯入邮局行劫的犯人。这个犯人原来是第二次世界大战中的美国空军“英雄”，直接参与广岛、长崎的原子弹轰炸的埃瑟莱少校。
    据美国“新闻周刊”报道，十二年以前，埃瑟莱是美国最出风头的飞行员之一。他身强力壮，飞行技术被认为达到了顶点，平日无忧无虑、愉快活泼，并且美国特务机关在“极端严格的忠诚鉴定”中曾给以好评。由于这些条件，埃瑟莱和其他四个人，被选拔出来执行第一次原子弹轰炸任务。埃瑟莱并担任了一架名叫“同花顺”号飞机的机长。
    1945年8月6日，埃瑟莱驾驶着“同花顺”号同其他三架飞机一道飞到日本上空，进行轰炸前的侦察。他发现广岛的投弹条件“合适”，于是就飞回指定地点引导载有第一颗原子弹的飞机到广岛投了弹。爆炸后，他还在广岛上空侦察了投弹结果。几天之后，埃瑟莱又飞到长崎执行了同样的任务！
    由于干了这些惨绝人寰的罪恶差使，美国政府曾授予埃瑟莱以“优异飞行十字章”和其他奖励。他被捧为空军“英雄”；退伍后还每月领到二百三十七美元的年金。
    可是，美国政府的“奖赏”却抵挡不了良心上的折磨。广岛、长崎数十万无辜被害者的凄惨情景，全世界人民反对原子武器的怒吼，使得埃瑟莱日夕不安，终于神经失常了。退伍回家之后，他时常半夜三更叫喊：“跳伞！跳伞！”梦见他驾驶着飞机在东京上空被击落，坐在着了火的飞机里待毙。1950年起他进了医院，但医药也偿赎不了他的罪孽，神经病越来越严重，并屡次跑出医院犯罪。妻子也和他离婚了。去年秋天，他曾因结伙行劫被法院侦讯了九十天。他在法庭上说：“我不知道为什么要干这样的事。我并不需要钱。”
    埃瑟莱的下场，使人联想到了坠楼自杀的美国前国防部长福莱斯特。这是在美国的原子弹歇斯底里中所出现的两种神经狂乱的典型。一种是被自己所热衷策划的原子战争吓疯了，结果是跳了楼；另一种是自己还“不知道为什么”就被驱使去充当了大规模屠杀人类的工具，结果受到良心的谴责而发了疯。这两种人的处境虽然不同，下场却是一样的。这对于美国那些还在疯狂地准备原子战争的冒险者们，不能不是一个有力的警告。（平）（附图片）
