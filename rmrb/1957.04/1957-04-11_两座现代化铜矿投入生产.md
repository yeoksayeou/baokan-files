Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, April 9th: The Xinye Copper Mine in Hubei Province officially commenced production at the beginning of April. This copper mine was completed in October 1956. After five months of trial production, all technical indicators have reached or are close to the design requirements.

The Xinye Copper Mine is a copper mine with a high degree of mechanization and automation in its production process. This mine has advantageous conditions such as large reserves, high ore grade, concentrated ore bodies, and convenient transportation. At the current production level and production value, it can fully recover the state's investment in it within five years.

Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, April 9th: A medium-sized modern copper mine—the Shouwangfen Copper Mine—has officially commenced production at the beginning of April after four years of geological work and two years of capital construction.

The Shouwangfen Copper Mine is located in the mountains of northern Hebei Province, 120 kilometers away from Chengde City. It possesses abundant and high-quality copper ore resources. On April 1, 1951, thousands of geological exploration and mine construction workers began work here. After six years of heroic labor, they finally built a medium-sized mining and beneficiation enterprise in this barren mountain, including mining and beneficiation equipment. In the design and construction of this copper mine, full consideration was given to the comprehensive utilization of raw materials. In addition to copper concentrate, it can also recover hundreds of thousands of tons of magnetite concentrate annually, which can be used as raw materials for ironmaking enterprises.

The equipment in this copper mine is all mechanized and automated. The machinery and equipment installed in the concentrator is entirely manufactured in China.

    两座现代化铜矿投入生产
    新华社武汉9日电　湖北省新冶铜矿4月初正式投入生产。这个铜矿是1956年10月份建成的，经过五个月的试生产，目前各项技术指标已经达到或接近设计要求。
    新冶铜矿是一个生产过程机械化、自动化程度很高的铜矿。这个矿具有蕴藏量大、矿石品位高、矿体集中、交通方便等优越条件。按照目前的生产水平和生产价值，它在五年内就可以全部收回国家对它的投资。
    新华社保定9日电　一座中型的近代化铜矿——寿王坟铜矿，经过四年的地质工作和两年的基本建设，已在4月初正式投入生产。
    寿王坟铜矿位于河北省北部离承德市一百二十公里的群山中。这里蕴藏着丰富的优质铜矿资源。1951年4月1日，数千名地质勘探和矿山建设者在这里开始了工作。经过六年的英勇劳动，终于在这个荒山里建成了一座包括采矿、选矿等设备的中型采选企业。这个铜矿在设计和建设中，充分考虑了原料的综合利用，除铜精矿外，每年还可回收数十万吨磁铁精矿，供作炼铁企业的原料。
    这个铜矿的设备全部是机械化自动化的，其中选矿厂安装的机器设备，完全是我国自己制造的。
