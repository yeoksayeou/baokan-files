Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 22nd Dispatch: The Soviet people deeply cherish Lenin's manuscripts. Currently, the Institute of Marxism-Leninism under the CPSU Central Committee has already collected more than 30,000 handwritten documents by Lenin himself. The explanations for these relics alone fill twenty-one volumes. Thousands of people participated in the work of collecting his manuscripts.

Many of Lenin's manuscripts were not easy to obtain, as a large part of them were scattered around the world, preserved in private libraries and in the archives of various organizations. The interpretation of many manuscripts is quite difficult, because they contain a large number of abbreviations and are in cursive writing.

Many of Lenin's documents were already severely damaged when they were discovered and collected. Some papers were stained with age, and the ink had faded, seemingly beyond restoration. However, after extremely meticulous and skillful processing by experts, the documents were salvaged; the paper was restored to like-new condition, the stains disappeared, and the writing became clear and understandable.

These documents are now carefully preserved in special storage rooms. The rooms are constantly maintained at a fixed temperature and humidity. Before the documents are stored, they are sterilized and photographed for archival purposes.

The image on the right is the first page of Lenin's manuscript "Comrade Workers! Let us go to the final decisive battle!" written in August 1918.

    列宁手迹永不朽
    苏共中央珍藏遗墨三万多件
    新华社24日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科22日讯：苏联人民非常珍视列宁的手稿。现在苏共中央马克思列宁主义研究院已经收藏了三万多件列宁亲笔书写的文件。单是这些遗墨的说明就足足有二十一卷。有数千人参加了收集他的遗墨的工作。
    列宁的许多手稿得来是不容易的，因为其中很大一部分散失在世界各地，保存在私人的书库里以及不同组织机关的资料库里。许多手稿的阐释工作是相当困难的，因为其中有大量的缩写，而且又是草书。
    列宁的许多文件在被发现和收集的时候，都已经残破不堪。有的纸张因年久而污损了，墨迹也褪了色，似乎已经不能复原了。但是，经过了专家们的极其细致精巧的加工以后，文件得到了挽救；纸张复原得像新的一样，污迹没有了，文字也变得清晰明白了。
    这些文件现在被小心地保藏在特殊的库房中。库房内经常保持着固定的温度和湿度。文件入库前，还要经过消毒和拍成照片存查。
