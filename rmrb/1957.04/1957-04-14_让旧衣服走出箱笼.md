    Let Old Clothes Out of the Chests
    Ji Tao
    Among urban residents, there are still many old clothes that can be worn. This is because some people are overly particular about styles and chase after new colors, often making new clothes after wearing a new one for only a short time. When the new ones come, the old ones are buried deep in the bottom of the chests, accumulating over time, often leaving many useful clothes shelved for a long time. Also, some families, due to changes in the number of people, age, or changes in body size, often have many clothes abandoned halfway and collected. This leaves some useful items in a state of "no place to be useful" for life. If we think about the ancient saying "every thread and strand should make us think of where it came from with difficulty," we should make use of these clothes.
    In fact, making use of these clothes is also a way to be diligent and thrifty in managing the household. We often see housewives like this: they add color to faded clothes, alter outdated clothes, alter clothes that adults cannot wear for children, and alter clothes that older children cannot wear for younger children. Although their family income is not high, they often keep the whole family neatly dressed and well-fed. From the point of view of managing the household, we should strive for simplicity according to our economic income and the actual level of national production development, and develop a quality of being happy with plain clothes and simple food.
    Taking out old clothes to wear will allow oneself to buy less cotton cloth from the country; selling unworn old clothes to second-hand clothing stores can also appropriately meet the needs of others, allowing these people to buy less cotton cloth from the country as well. This is a good thing for oneself, for others, and for the country. According to the transaction situation of the Xishui County Auction Department, the old clothes sold in four months would require 24,479 feet of cotton cloth to make if new cloth were used. If old clothing stores are restored and established in cities across the country to help people buy and sell, and let old clothes out of the chests, the amount of cotton cloth saved for the country will be an astonishing figure.

    让旧衣服走出箱笼
    季涛
    在城市居民中间，可以穿用的旧衣服还是很多的。这是因为有些人过分讲求式样，追逐花色，往往一件新衣穿用不久，又去做一件新的。新的来了，旧的就深没箱底，递相积压，常使许多有用衣物长期搁置了。也有些人家由于人口、年龄的变异，身体肥瘦的消长，许多衣服常是半途而废被收藏起来。这样就使一些有用之物终身处于“无用武之地”。如果想一想“一丝一缕当思来处不易”的古训，就应该把这些衣服利用起来。
    其实，把这些衣服加以利用，也是一种勤俭持家的作法。我们常常看到这样的家庭主妇：她们把脱色的衣服加点色，把过时的衣服改下装，把大人不能穿的衣服改给孩子穿，把大孩子不能穿的衣服改给小孩子穿，虽然她们家庭的收入并不多，却常使全家衣衫整洁，吃用充足。从治家过日子这一点说，就应该根据自己的经济收入状况和国家生产发展的现实水平，力求简朴，养成以素衣粗食为乐的品质。
    把旧衣服拿出来穿，自己就可以少向国家买点棉布；把穿不完的旧衣服卖给旧衣铺，也可以适当满足别人的需要，使这些人也少向国家买点棉布。这是对己对人对国家都有好处的事情。根据浠水县拍卖部交易的情况看，四个月卖出的旧衣服，若用新布去作，就得棉布二万四千四百七十九尺。如果全国各城市都把旧衣铺恢复与设立起来，帮助群众进行买卖，让旧衣服走出箱笼，为国家节约的棉布将会是一个惊人的数字。
