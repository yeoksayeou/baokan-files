Local Vignettes:

    The almost extinct purebred "Lion Head Goose" will be bred in large quantities at the Chenghai County Goose Breeding Farm in Guangdong Province. Soon, people will be able to eat more "Lion Head Geese," each weighing twenty to thirty catties.

    Thirty years ago, the Chao-Shan Plain raised a lot of "Lion Head Geese." Later, because the farmers' lives were difficult and feed was scarce, most farmers raised hybrids and rarely raised this type of goose. After the Guangdong Provincial Department of Agriculture built the Chenghai Goose Breeding Farm, it took a lot of effort to collect a batch of purebreds. The farm now raises 692 breeding geese, and the first batch of eggs laid this year can breed more than 4,000.

### 澄海县的“狮头鹅”

    澄海县的“狮头鹅”
    几乎绝迹的纯种“狮头鹅”，将在广东省澄海县种鹅场大量繁殖。不久，人们可以吃到更多的每只重二三十斤的“狮头鹅”了。
    三十年前，潮汕平原饲养“狮头鹅”较多。以后，因为农民生活困苦，饲料缺乏，大多数农民养的是杂交种，很少养这种鹅。广东省农业厅兴建澄海种鹅场后，花了不少工夫，才搜集到一批纯种。该场现在养了六百九十二只种鹅，今年生的第一批蛋就可繁殖四千多只。
