    Commentary on the Jordanian Political Situation

    The recent government crisis in Jordan has caused serious concern. This crisis is actually not merely an internal problem of Jordan, but a sharp struggle between the imperialist policy of aggression in the Middle East and the policy of peace and neutrality, which is advocated and supported by the people of Arab countries.

    In recent years, with the upsurge of the anti-colonialist struggle of the Middle Eastern people, the Jordanian people have become increasingly determined to oppose imperialist rule and demand national independence. Under the impetus of the Jordanian people and the influence of other Arab countries that insist on independence, the King of Jordan, in March 1956, dismissed the British General Glubb, who had long controlled the Arab Legion in Jordan, taking the first step for Jordan to break away from British colonial rule. After the Suez Canal issue occurred, the Jordanian people's anti-colonialist sentiment rose even higher. As a result, when Jordan held parliamentary elections in 1956, despite the various influences and pressures exerted by the imperialists on Jordan, parties advocating the maintenance of national independence and pursuing a policy of active neutrality still gained an advantage in the parliament and formed a cabinet headed by National Socialist Nabulsi as Prime Minister.

    Supported by Arab countries such as Egypt and Syria, the Nabulsi cabinet abolished the unequal treaty between Britain and Jordan, and advocated strengthening solidarity with Egypt and Syria to jointly oppose imperialist aggression. It opposed the Baghdad Pact and the Eisenhower Doctrine, and actively pursued a policy of peace and neutrality to safeguard sovereignty and independence. Such a government was, of course, disliked by the imperialists. Jordan is geographically the link between Egypt and Syria. Now the imperialists are trying their best to isolate Egypt and Syria, which they see as thorns in their side. In their view, if they can reverse Jordan's political trend, they will drive a wedge between Egypt and Syria, so that these two countries of peace and neutrality cannot echo each other, making it easier to defeat them one by one. The government crisis in Jordan occurred under these circumstances.

    The timing of the crisis clearly shows that behind the scenes, it was the United States, which was attempting to promote the Eisenhower Doctrine in the Middle East, that precipitated this crisis. According to the United Press, the United States promised Jordan "substantial supportive assistance in defense" six weeks ago. On April 9, the Richards mission from the United States flew from Iraq to Saudi Arabia. On April 10, King Hussein of Jordan ordered the Nabulsi cabinet to resign. Prior to this, Nabulsi had announced that Jordan would establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. On April 5, he also denounced the Eisenhower Doctrine and announced the establishment of a federation of Jordan, Syria, and Egypt. To fuel this crisis, the United States threatened to suspend the Fourth Point Program and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East program in Jordan. From Saudi Arabia came the news that Israel would attack Jordan on April 10. This news was clearly intended to prepare the Iraqi and Saudi Arabian troops now stationed in Jordan to interfere in the Jordanian situation in the event of circumstances unfavorable to imperialism.

    The day after Nabulsi's resignation, on April 11, Washington was pleased to "expect" Jordan to immediately request the Richards mission to visit Jordan. But they "expected" it a little too early. The Jordanian people resolutely opposed accepting the Eisenhower Doctrine and demanded the continued pursuit of a policy of peace and neutrality. Demonstrations took place in many parts of Jordan. At the end of last week, according to the United Press, Rountree, Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs at the U.S. State Department, openly stated that he "hoped that Hussein's efforts to establish a government without the participation of people with communist tendencies (the so-called people with communist tendencies refer to people who oppose the Eisenhower Doctrine) would be successful." At the same time, Iraq increased its troops on the Jordanian border, ready to enter Jordan at any time. However, the Jordanian people continued to persevere in their struggle.

    On April 15, Hussein Khalidi, a non-partisan figure, formed a new cabinet, with former Prime Minister Nabulsi serving as Minister of Foreign Affairs in the new cabinet. In the letters between the King and the new Prime Minister, it was stated that the new cabinet would maintain a policy of active neutrality in international affairs, "resist imperialism and any foreign alliances, as well as any plans that do not conform to Arab interests." A Jordanian government spokesman stated: "Jordan's foreign policy will continue to be consistent with the foreign policies of free Arab countries such as Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia." Obviously, the formation of the new cabinet reflected the strength of Jordan's patriotic forces. However, the US aggression against the Middle East under the banner of the Eisenhower Doctrine has only just begun, and it is eager to gain control of Jordan in order to expand the Baghdad Pact group or form a so-called "anti-communist alliance" to encircle Syria. The New York Herald Tribune published an editorial on April 15 saying that the United States should strengthen Jordan's ties with Iraq and Saudi Arabia, rather than with Egypt and Syria, and that "this desire must be specifically implemented in Jordan and produce practical results." Of course, the United States is temporarily disappointed now, but it will never be reconciled. This struggle will obviously continue.

    评约旦政局
    约旦最近的政府危机，引起了人们的严重关切。这次危机实际上不仅仅是约旦内部的问题，而是帝国主义对中东的侵略政策和阿拉伯各国人民所拥护和支持的和平中立政策之间的一场尖锐的斗争。
    最近几年以来，随着中东人民反殖民主义斗争的高涨，约旦人民日益坚决地反对帝国主义统治、要求民族独立。在约旦人民的推动和其他坚持独立的阿拉伯国家影响之下，约旦国王在1956年3月解除了长期控制着约旦的阿拉伯军团的英国将军格拉布的职务，为约旦摆脱英国的殖民统治迈开了第一步。苏伊士运河问题发生以后，约旦人民反对殖民主义的情绪更加高涨。其结果就是在1956年约旦举行议会选举的时候，尽管帝国主义者对约旦施加种种影响和压力，主张维护民族独立和奉行积极中立政策的党派仍然在议会中取得了优势，并且组成了以国家社会党人纳布西为首相的内阁。
    纳布西内阁在埃及、叙利亚等阿拉伯国家的支持下，废除了英国和约旦之间的不平等条约，并且主张加强同埃及和叙利亚的团结，来共同反对帝国主义的侵略。它反对巴格达条约和艾森豪威尔主义，积极奉行维护主权和独立的和平中立政策。这样一个政府，当然是帝国主义者们所不喜欢的。约旦在地理位置上是埃及和叙利亚的联结点。现在帝国主义者正在竭力设法孤立它们的眼中钉埃及和叙利亚。在它们看来，如果能够扭转约旦的政治趋向，它们就在埃及和叙利亚之间打进了一个楔子，使这两个和平中立的国家不能互相呼应，便于各个击破。约旦的政府危机，就是在这种形势下发生的。
    危机发生的时机，清楚地说明了在幕后促成这次危机的，是企图在中东推销艾森豪威尔主义的美国。据合众社报道，美国在六个星期以前，就答应给约旦“在防务方面提供大量的支持性援助”。4月9日，美国的理查兹代表团从伊拉克飞往沙特阿拉伯。4月10日，约旦国王侯赛因下令纳布西内阁辞职。在此以前，纳布西曾经宣布约旦将同苏联建立外交关系。他在4月5日又痛斥艾森豪威尔主义，并且宣布将成立约旦、叙利亚、埃及联邦。为了给这次危机推波助澜，美国扬言要在约旦停止第四点计划和联合国近东巴勒斯坦难民救济及就业局的计划。而从沙特阿拉伯则传出了以色列将在4月10日进攻约旦的消息。这个消息显然是想给现在驻在约旦的伊拉克和沙特阿拉伯的军队，在一旦发生不利于帝国主义的情况时干涉约旦局势作好准备。
    在纳布西辞职以后的第二天，4月11日，华盛顿方面就欣慰地“预料”约旦将立即要求理查兹代表团访问约旦。可是他们“预料”得未免早了一点。约旦人民坚决反对接受艾森豪威尔主义，要求继续奉行和平中立的政策。在约旦许多地方都发生了示威。在上个星期末，据合众社报道，美国国务院负责近东事务的助理国务卿朗特里，公开表示“希望侯赛因在建立一个没有共产党倾向的人（所谓共产党倾向的人是指反对艾森豪威尔主义的人）参加的政府方面所进行的努力会获得成功”。同时，伊拉克在约旦边境增加了军队，准备随时开入约旦。可是，约旦人民仍然坚持他们的斗争。
    4月15日，无党派人士侯赛尼·哈利迪组成了新内阁，前任首相纳布西在新阁中担任外交大臣的职务。在国王同新首相的信件中表明，新内阁在国际事务中将保持积极中立的政策，“抵抗帝国主义和任何外国联盟，以及任何不符合阿拉伯利益的计划”。约旦政府发言人表示：“约旦的外交政策仍然将同埃及、叙利亚和沙特阿拉伯这些自由的阿拉伯国家的外交政策取得一致”。显然，新内阁的组成反映了约旦的爱国主义力量的强大。但是，美国在艾森豪威尔主义的旗帜下对中东的侵略还只是刚刚开始，而它又急于取得对约旦的控制，以便扩大巴格达条约集团，或者组成所谓“反共联盟”，对叙利亚形成包围。“纽约先驱论坛报”在4月15日发表社论说，美国应该使约旦同伊拉克和沙特阿拉伯、而不是同埃及和叙利亚加强联系，并且说“必须使这种意愿在约旦具体实行，产生实际效果”。当然，现在美国是暂时失望了，可是它是决不会甘心的。这场斗争显然还将继续下去。
