    Emphasize Foreign Language Teaching
    Bai Sheng

    Foreign language teaching is an important component of our country's education, and its importance is undeniable. Today, whether we are conducting scientific research, advancing on the road to science, or engaging in international political, cultural, and economic exchanges, foreign languages are very important tools. Especially at present, with the growing strength of international peace forces and the increasingly frequent exchanges between the people of our country and peace-loving people of all countries, the need for foreign language talents is even more pressing.

    Currently, comprehensive universities, foreign language institutes, and normal colleges in our country have cultivated some foreign language talents. Among the existing foreign language majors, except for English, German, and French, which had some foundation in the old Chinese universities, the rest were established after liberation, and Russian language teaching has made great progress.

    The current number of foreign language teachers and translators is still insufficient, and various foreign language courses cannot be fully offered. Especially in middle schools, due to the lack of foreign language teachers, foreign language courses in junior middle schools were temporarily suspended in the past few years. This situation should be changed immediately, and foreign language courses in junior middle schools should be restored as soon as possible to lay a good foundation for foreign language learning.

    At present, many university students cannot directly use foreign literature to engage in research work after graduation due to their low foreign language proficiency. Many materials and books are not translated, or the quality of translation is very low. Therefore, improving the quality of foreign language teaching is an important task for foreign language institutes and departments nationwide. The key to improving the quality of foreign language teaching lies in improving the quality of teachers.

    Since liberation, due to the country's urgent need for a large number of Russian translators, the training of Russian talents has received relatively good development conditions. However, not enough attention has been paid to the training of other foreign language talents, and there is a great shortage of talents in this area now. In the future, the enrollment quotas for other foreign language majors in various universities and colleges should also be increased appropriately according to actual needs.

    重视外国语教学工作
    柏生
    外国语教学工作是我国教育事业中的一个重要的组成部分，它的重要性是不容置疑的。今天，无论是在开展科学研究工作，向科学进军的道路上，或是在国际政治文化经济的交往上，外国语都是很重要的工具。尤其在目前，国际和平力量日益增长，我国人民同世界各国爱好和平的人民往来日益频繁，外国语人才的需要更十分迫切。
    目前，我国综合大学、外国语学院和师范学院，都培养了一些外国语人才。在现有的外国语专业中，除了英、德、法语在旧中国的大学中还有一些基础外，其余的都是解放后建立起来的，其中俄语教学有了很大的发展。
    现有的外国语师资和翻译人才数量还不够，各种外国语课程不能全部开出。尤其在中学方面，因外国语师资缺乏，过去几年曾暂时停开了初级中学的外国语课程。这种情况应该立即设法改变，早日恢复初级中学的外国语课程，使外国语学习的基础打好。
    目前，有不少大学生因外国语水平低，毕业后不能直接利用外国的文献资料从事研究工作。很多资料和书籍没有人翻译，或者翻译的质量很低。因此，提高外国语教学的质量是全国外语院、系的重要任务。而外国语教学质量的提高，关键又在于师资质量的提高。
    解放以来，由于国家迫切需要大量的俄语翻译人才，俄语人才的培养工作得到了比较好的发展条件。但是对其他外国语人才的培养却注意得很不够，现在这方面的人才非常缺乏。今后，各高等学校对其它外国语专业的招生名额，也应当根据实际需要，酌量增加。
