The Effect of Unpublished Letters
    Senior Party School Students Should Be Responsible for Their Own Travel Expenses Home During Vacations

    Editor's Note: In January of this year, a reader of this newspaper, Yao Changzhang, wrote a letter criticizing the Ministry of Finance's approval of public funds to cover the travel expenses of students at the Central Senior Party School for their 1956 winter vacation. After receiving this letter, the newspaper forwarded it to the Ministry of Finance for handling. Recently, the Ministry of Finance has made a review of this matter.

    Letter from the Ministry of Finance: We have received the letter from Comrade Yao Changzhang, as well as letters from other comrades, all of whom raised the point that the travel expenses of students at the Central Senior Party School for their 1956 winter vacation should not be paid by public funds. We believe this opinion is correct. According to the financial system regulations of the past few years, cadres are responsible for their own travel expenses home during their studies at schools, and the public does not bear these expenses. However, in December 1956, our ministry allowed the travel expenses of students at the Central Senior Party School for their 1956 winter vacation to be resolved within the local budget, without considering that doing so would not only violate the past financial system but also be inconsistent with the spirit of practicing thrift. This hasty approach was wrong. In addition to accepting the criticisms raised by Comrade Yao and other comrades, and admitting our mistake to the State Council, we have notified all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities that in the future, the travel expenses of students at the Central Senior Party School during their studies will continue to be handled in accordance with past regulations, and will be the responsibility of the individual.

    未发表的来信的效果
    高级党校学员假期回家旅费应由本人负责
    编者按　今年1月间，本报读者姚长璋来信，对财政部批准中共中央高级党校学员1956年寒假回家路费由公家开支提出批评。本报接到此信后，即转给财政部处理。最近，财政部已对此事作了检讨。
    财政部来信：我部接到姚长璋同志的来信以及其他一些同志的来信，他们都提出：中共中央高级党校学员1956年寒假回家旅费不应当由公家发给。我们认为这一意见是正确的。按照过去几年来财政制度上的规定，干部在学校学习期间的回家旅费都由本人负责解决，公家并不负担此项开支。但是1956年12月间我部却允许中共中央高级党校学员1956年寒假回家的旅费由地方预算内解决，而没有考虑到这样做不仅违反了过去的财政制度，并且也不符合厉行节约的精神。这种草率的做法是错误的。我部除了接受姚同志和其他同志提出的批评，并向国务院承认错误外，已经通知各省、自治区、市，今后中共中央高级党校学员在学习期间的回家旅费仍执行过去的规定，一律由本人负责解决。
