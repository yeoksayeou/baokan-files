On the morning of February 27th, the Nantong Prefectural Commissioner's Office received a telegram from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture. The gist of the telegram was:

"Our department plans to hold a telephone briefing conference on the evening of March 4th. Please prepare the following materials immediately:

    I. What is the status of agricultural cooperatives in various regions formulating production plans? What problems are there? How to solve them? Can this year's production targets be exceeded? By how much?

    II. How are the preparations for seeds, fertilizers, draught animals, and farm implements proceeding? What problems are there? How to solve them? Compared with the same period last year, what has increased and what has decreased? How to find ways to remedy the situation as soon as possible?

    III. How is the technical training plan arranged? What are the problems? How to solve them?

    IV. What achievements have been made in striving for a bumper harvest of summer crops? What are the problems? How to strengthen the management of wheat fields with slow growth?

    For the above materials, it is hoped that there will be classified and ranked figures, and it would be better to have typical examples to illustrate important issues."

Using such a long telegram to issue a notice naturally indicated the urgency and importance of the matter. Therefore, the Nantong Prefectural Commissioner's Office immediately instructed the Agricultural Section to prepare quickly. After studying the outline in detail, the head of the Agricultural Section and the Production Cooperation Department of the Prefectural Party Committee immediately held a departmental meeting. Then, they assigned five or six comrades from the technical team, seed team, and those responsible for fertilizer and farm machinery work to collect materials separately. Because the issues involved in this outline were very broad, and the Agricultural Section did not have some of the materials, they immediately sent people to the Prefectural Supply and Marketing Cooperative Office, Purchasing Bureau, Grain Bureau, and other relevant units to collect them, and also made long-distance calls to various counties to contact them. It was not until the afternoon of March 4th that these materials were compiled. Before 8:00 PM that evening, they were discussed and revised by everyone, and then the preparations were considered complete.

On March 4th, at 8:30 PM, fifteen cadres from the Agricultural Section and three comrades from the Provincial Department of Agriculture who came to inspect the work arrived at the Nantong City Post and Telecommunications Bureau's telephone conference room on time. Before 9:00 PM, the telephone conference began, hosted by Zeng Huaxuan, director of the Provincial Department of Agriculture's office. Everyone present was very familiar with his voice. As in previous telephone conferences, he first announced the order of speeches for each prefectural commissioner's office. To encourage everyone to stay until the end, he also unexpectedly announced that after the briefings were completed, they would also report on the news of people from various regions being sent to Beijing to visit the National Agricultural Exhibition. Apart from Section Chief Yan Yi, who was still busy preparing the speaking outline, all the other comrades listened silently. Thirty minutes had passed since the Xu Prefecture Agricultural Section's speech. Because of the accent, everyone could not understand it very well. Probably the host, Director Zeng, was also impatient, so he said on the phone: "There are still seven prefectures to talk about, the examples should be simple." The person reporting was not prepared to "shorten" their speech, so they could not stop immediately; after three more urges, their speech ended at 9:55 PM. The second speaker was a comrade from the Huaiyin Prefecture Agricultural Section. Before the speech, Director Zeng instructed them to "be as simple and concise as possible." Despite this, Director Zeng asked them to be "concise" twice during the Huaiyin Prefecture's speech. As a result, they still spoke for thirty-two minutes. Several comrades in the conference room who had participated in this type of telephone conference before had become accustomed to grasping the rules of the Agricultural Department's telephone conferences, so they predicted, "The initial briefings will be longer, the middle ones shorter, and the last ones will not be allowed to speak for even a minute." Sure enough, as expected, when the Yancheng Prefecture spoke, they were limited to twenty minutes and could not exceed that. Including the Yangzhou Prefecture's speech, one hundred and thirty-six minutes had already passed. It was the Nantong Prefecture's turn to speak, the fifth speaker. In order to accommodate the three prefectures that still had to report, they only planned to talk for ten minutes, and other information would be sent in writing, which would only take two days from Nantong to Nanjing. Who knew that when it was finally Nantong Prefecture's turn to report, the host announced again: "Due to time constraints tonight, the speeches will end here. Tomorrow, we will exchange information individually with the prefectures that have not spoken on the phone." Finally, it took a long time to notify the prefectural commissioners' offices, agricultural experiment stations, tractor stations, and agricultural schools in the telephone conference what kind of representatives to send to Beijing to visit the National Agricultural Exhibition, how many people to send, when to gather, what route to take, etc. In the loudspeaker, some words were not clear, and people from various prefectures clamored and asked to repeat them. Director Zeng said: "This notice has already been printed, and it will be issued tomorrow. Everyone can follow the notice, but I will tell you now." This is really strange! Since the notice has been printed and can be issued tomorrow, why bother notifying on the phone? At this telephone conference, not a single word was mentioned about opinions on current work. After a while, just as everyone was about to leave the conference room, the telephone speaker rang again. This time it must be work instructions, right? No, it was Director Zeng's self-criticism. He said: The briefing outline drafted by the Agricultural Department Office had too much content, so there was not enough time to report. This was a shortcoming in the work, etc. The meeting was officially announced to be over, and it was already 11:30 PM.

On the way back to the office, everyone felt bewildered. Why was this general briefing conducted in the form of a telephone conference? What problems could this kind of meeting solve?

We inquired at the Nantong City Post and Telecommunications Bureau's long-distance station and learned that this telephone conference, including the telegram fees sent to the prefectures on the 27th, cost a total of more than 1,100 yuan.

    令人茫然的一次电话会议
    李康佐　丁远
    2月27日上午，南通专署接到了江苏省农业厅拍来的一份电报。电报大意是：
    “我厅拟于3月4日晚召开电话汇报会议，请即准备下列材料：
    一、各地农业社制订生产计划的情况如何？有些什么问题？如何解决？今年生产指标能否超过？超过多少？
    二、种子、肥料、耕畜农具等准备得如何？有那些问题？如何解决？与去年同时期对比，那些增加了，那些减少了？如何及早设法补救？
    三、技术训练的计划如何安排？有什么问题？怎样解决？
    四、争取夏熟丰收取得那些成绩？有什么问题？对生长缓慢的麦田如何加强管理？
    上述材料，希望有分类排队数字，对重要问题有典型例子说明更好。”
    用这样的一份长电报来发通知，当然表示事情之紧急、重要。于是，南通专署即责令农业科迅速准备。农业科科长和地委生产合作部研究后，马上召开部门会议，对这个提纲作了详尽的研究，之后又布置技术组、种子组，以及负责肥料、农药械工作的五六个同志，分头整理材料。由于这个提纲里涉及的问题很广，有些材料农业科没有，又立即派人去专署供销合作办事处、采购局、粮食局等有关单位搜集，还打长途电话到各县联系。直忙到4日下午，才把这些材料汇集起来，晚上八点钟以前，又经大家讨论修正，才算准备就绪。
    3月4日，晚上八点半，农业科十五个干部和省农业厅来检查工作的三位同志，准时到达了南通市邮电局电话会议室。九点钟还不到，电话会议开始了，主持会议的人是省农业厅办公室主任曾华轩。参加会议的人都熟透了他的声音，他同以往召开电话会议时候一样，先宣布各专署的发言次序。为了鼓励大家有始有终，又意外地宣布了汇报完还要报告一件关于各地派人到北京参观全国农业展览会的消息。到会的同志，除了严艺科长还忙着准备发言提纲外，其他同志都鸦雀无声地静听。徐州专区农业科的发言三十分钟已经过去了。因为口音的关系，大家都听不太懂。大概主持会议的曾主任也听的不耐烦了，就在电话里说：“还有七个专区要谈，举例要简单。”汇报的人思想上没有“缩短”的准备，所以一下子不能收场；又经过三次催促，他的发言才在九点五十五分钟结束。第二个汇报的是淮阴专区农业科的同志，在发言前曾主任就嘱咐要
  “尽量简单扼要”。尽管如此，淮阴专区在发言中途曾主任又两次要求“简要”。结果，还讲了三十二分钟。在会议室里有几位曾经参加过这种电话会议的同志，他们已经习惯地掌握了农业厅电话会议的规律，所以预测说“开始汇报长些，中间短些，最后连一分钟也不许讲”。果然不出所料，接着盐城专区发言时限定二十分钟，不得超过。但连扬州专区发言在内，一百三十六分钟已经过去了。第五位发言的，该轮到南通专区了，为了照顾还有三个专区要汇报，只准备谈十分钟，其他情况准备书面寄去，从南通到南京，也只需两天就行了。谁知道好容易轮到南通专区汇报的时候，主持会议者又宣布：“今晚因为时间关系，发言到此为止，明天再同没有谈的专署用电话个别交换情况。”最后又花了很长时间，在电话会议里通知各专署、农业试验场、拖拉机站、农校派什么样的代表到北京参观全国农业展览会，派多少人，什么时候集中，走什么路线等等。在扩音机里，有些话听不清楚，各专署的人就乱嚷起来了，都要求再讲一遍。曾主任说：“这个通知，我们已经印好了，明天就可以发出，大家可以根据通知执行，不过现在先告诉你们一下。”这真奇怪！既然通知印好了，明天即可发出，又何必在电话里通知呢？在这个电话会议上，对于当前工作的意见，一字未提。隔了一会，大家正要离开会议室，电话喇叭里又响起来了。这回该是工作指示了吧？不，是曾主任的检讨。他说：农业厅办公室拟的汇报提纲内容过多，以致来不及汇报，这是工作上的缺点，等等。会议正式宣布结束，已经是晚上十一点三十分了。
    在回机关的路上，大家都感到茫然。这种一般性的汇报为什么要采取电话会议的形式？这样的会议能解决什么问题呢？
    我们向南通市邮电局长途台询问了一下，了解到这次电话会议，连同27日打到各专署的电报费在内，总共花了一千一百多元。
