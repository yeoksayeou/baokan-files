    Demobilized Soldier Becomes Drilling Team Leader
　  By Our Reporter Liu Bang
    "It takes at least two to three years to become a driller; how did you become a co-driller after only six months? What's the secret?" A group of young people who had just transferred from the army to the Yumen Oilfield Drilling Company surrounded Yao Fulin, pressing him for an answer.

    Yao Fulin really didn't have any "secret." He only talked about things that most people understood.

    In the winter of 1952—on the eve of the start of the country's first Five-Year Plan for economic construction, a group of soldiers were ordered to transfer to the Yumen Oilfield, and Yao Fulin was one of them.

    One winter morning, a car drove across the frozen Oil River, climbing towards the towering peaks dotted with derricks, bringing them to the drilling site. This was a tour organized by the Mining Bureau before assigning them work. On the snow-covered slopes of the Qilian Mountains stood giant derricks; beneath them, heavy drill pipes constantly moved up and down, rotating, shaking the deep strata. The roar of diesel engines drowned out the entire valley. Drilling workers wearing silver aluminum helmets and long leather boots were busy pulling catheads, hooking elevators, and lifting slips, working with increasing intensity. Despite the freezing temperatures, the workers still frequently wiped sweat from their brows. …

    A few days later, Yao Fulin was learning to operate the inside tongs when he unfortunately encountered a high-pressure water and gas layer, and mud sprayed upwards like a fountain. In an instant, the crown block, the drilling platform, Yao Fulin's face, body, clothes, and boots were all drenched in mud. In the wilderness, where the temperature was below minus twenty degrees, the sticky mud instantly froze. His clothes turned into "armor." Cotton gloves stuck to the tongs and couldn't be removed. Yao Fulin's limbs went numb. At this moment, an old driller ran over to take his place: "Let go! Go inside and warm your clothes by the stove, warm yourself up before you continue."

    Yao Fulin remained standing still, silently persisting to the end.

    Yao Fulin's mentor, Ren Rongtang, was moved by his diligence and hard work, and from then on, he proactively explained this and that to him.

    After that, for several months, Yao Fulin was nowhere to be found in theaters, ballparks, or card rooms. Of course, it would be incorrect to say that Yao Fulin had no entertainment in his life. People discovered that he had learned this song from some point on:

    There is a young lad, coming from afar to our oilfield. He wants to be a petroleum worker, so we put an aluminum helmet on him. Dear young brother!
    Please wear this aluminum helmet straight. When you wear the aluminum helmet, you must swear to the derrick: never betray the glory of a petroleum worker.

    One day, after getting off the night shift and returning to the dormitory, Yao Fulin suddenly asked Ren Rongtang earnestly: "Where do you think I'm not working hard enough? Or am I just inherently stupid? Why have I been learning for so long, and I'm still clumsy when you let me handle things on my own?"

    Ren Rongtang laughed heartily after hearing this: "Look at that three-foot-thick ice in the Oil River, do you think it froze in one morning? Success comes naturally with effort! We used to take two or three years to graduate, but you've only been here for two or three months. Don't be so greedy!"

    Ren Rongtang's hearty laughter did not ease Yao Fulin's heavy mood. He lay crookedly on the bed, speaking as if answering and talking to himself: "What era was that before? What era is this now? How can we still use the old almanac? What kind of soldier is this? …".

    From then on, he resolved to learn from everyone. When he encountered difficulties, he would ask anyone he could find. Seeing that the old driller Sun Defu did not put his feet under the drill pipe when pulling it, and the swing of the drill pipe was small, saving effort and being safe, he carefully learned this method; discovering that Captain Fu Jilong used his right hand to pull the cathead and tighten the threads, and his left hand to throw the pulled rope, with clean and neat movements, he also kept it in mind and turned it into his own.

    As everyone already knows, he learned the driller's technique that others took two to three years to learn in six months, and was therefore named a model worker in the oilfield. Romanian team leader Burdan, who supported the Chinese drilling team, especially liked his spirit of humbly learning hard, and wanted to pass on all his skills to him and train him to be a drilling team leader. Unfortunately, Yao Fulin had an accident not long after. At that time, he was a driller in a team in the Qingcaowan exploration area. Drilling work was very intense. One day, it was Yao Fulin's shift. The drill pipe threads seemed to be deliberately making things difficult for him, and no matter how he fiddled with them, they wouldn't come loose. Rope after rope was broken. Seeing that the drilling progress was about to be delayed, Yao Fulin got angry and started to act recklessly, using steel wire rope as hemp rope. With a snap, the steel wire rope as thick as a wine glass was also twisted off. The severed steel wire rope lunged straight at the cathead like a crazed poisonous snake, entangling Yao Fulin's arm, who was operating the cathead, and severing one of his arms. When he was lying in the hospital bed listening to the leaders' sincere condolences, this iron-willed man actually shed tears. He wasn't unable to bear the pain of the wound, but was heartbroken by his recklessness—strictly speaking, a violation of operating procedures. A fall into the pit, a gain in your wit. A few months later, when Yao Fulin came out with one arm covered in plaster and bandages to take up the position of drilling team leader, he often warned his partners: "This machine is strange, if you understand its temperament, it will obey you; if you can't control it, it will turn around and make trouble for you."

    Not long ago, when I visited him, he methodically told me about his learning process and work experience. His diligent and painstaking attitude left me with a very deep impression.

    当了钻井队长的复员军人
　  本报记者　柳梆
    “做个司钻最少得学两三年；而你才学了六个月就当副司钻，有什么秘诀呀？”刚从部队转业到玉门油矿钻井公司的一伙年青人，团团围住了姚福林在逼迫他回答。
    姚福林确实没有什么“秘诀”，他只讲了一些一般人了解的事情。
    1952年冬天——祖国开始第一个五年计划经济建设的前夜，一批部队战士奉命转业到玉门油矿，姚福林是其中的一个。
    一个冬天的早晨，汽车驶过了冰封的石油河，爬向井架林立的群峰深处，把他们带到了钻井现场。这是矿务局在分配他们的工作以前举办的一次参观。白雪皑皑的祁连山坡，立着巨人似的钻塔；在它的底下，沉重的钻杆不断地在上下飞舞，左右旋转，震撼着深深的地层。柴油机的吼叫声淹没了整个山谷。头戴银色铝盔足蹬长统皮靴的钻井工人，正忙着拉猫头，扣吊卡，提卡瓦，工作一阵紧似一阵。尽管在滴水成冰的季节里，工人们还是不时用袖子去揩脑门上的汗水。……
    几天以后，姚福林在学着打内钳，不巧碰到了高压水层和气层，泥浆像喷泉一样往上喷。刹那间，天车上，井台上，姚福林的脸上，身上，衣服和靴子，都被泥浆淋透了。零下二十几度的旷野，粘糊糊湿漉漉的泥浆顷刻间就结成了冰。衣服变成了“铠甲”。棉手套粘到钳子上取不下来。姚福林的四肢冻麻了。这时，一个老钻工跑来接替他：“撒手吧！到屋里炉子上烤烤衣服，暖暖身子再说。
    姚福林仍然屹立不动，一声不响地坚持到最后。
    姚福林的师傅任荣堂被他这种勤学苦练的品质感动了，从此就主动地给他讲这讲那。
    在这之后，接连几个月，戏院、球场、扑克场上都看不到姚福林的踪迹。当然，如果说姚福林生活中就没有娱乐那也是不对的。人们发觉他不知从什么时候起就学会了这支歌：
    有一个年轻的小伙子，老远地来到我们油矿上。他要当一个石油工人，我们就把铝盔给他戴上。亲爱的年轻的兄弟啊！
    请你把这铝盔戴端正。戴上铝盔你就得对着井架起誓：永远不能辜负石油工人的光荣。
    一天，下了夜班回到宿舍，姚福林忽然一本正经地问任荣堂：“你看我哪个环节下功夫不够，还是我这个人生来秉性笨，为啥学了这么些日子，方才你让我单独扶把时我还是毛手毛脚？”
    任荣堂听罢却呵呵大笑：“你看那石油河里三尺厚冰，难道这是一个早上冻成的么？功到自然成嘛！从前我们学两三年才出师，如今你才来了两三个月。别贪心不足咯！”
    任荣堂爽朗的笑声并没有使姚福林沉重的心情轻松一些。他歪躺在床上，像答话又像在自言自语：“从前是什么时代？现在又是什么时代？怎好还搬用旧皇历？这算个啥战士呀？……”。
    从此，他下决心向每个人学习，碰到疑难的地方，不管谁他都拉着问。看见老钻工孙德富拉钻杆时两脚不放在钻杆下面，钻杆摆动的幅度不大，既省力气又安全，他就细心学习这个方法；发现傅积隆队长用右手拉猫头，紧丝扣，左手把拉过来的绳子扔过去，动作干净利索，他也牢记在心，变为自己的东西。
    正像大家已经知道的那样，他用六个月的功夫学会了别人要学两三年的司钻技术，因此被评为油矿的劳动模范。罗马尼亚支援中国钻井队的布尔丹队长特别喜欢他那虚心苦学的精神，要把自己浑身的本事传授给他，培养他为钻井队长。可惜不久姚福林出了一次岔子。那时候他是青草湾探区一个井队的司钻。钻探工作进行得十分紧张。有一天，正好是姚福林当班。钻杆丝扣好像故意为难他似的，怎样摆弄也卸不开。棕绳一根又一根地给扯断了。眼看钻井进尺要被耽误了。姚福林一冒火就蛮干起来，硬拿钢丝绳当棕绳用。只听叭哒一声，酒杯那样粗大的钢丝绳也给绞断了。断了头的钢丝绳就像发疯的毒蛇那样直扑猫头，一下就缠到正在操纵猫头的姚福林的胳臂上，截断了一只胳臂。当他躺在医院的病床上听着首长们恳切慰问的时候，这个铁一般的汉子竟然落泪了。他不是熬不过伤口的发疼，而是痛心自己的冒失——严格点说是违犯操作规程。吃一堑，长一智。几个月以后，当姚福林吊着一只涂满石膏、缠着绑带的胳臂出来执行钻井队长职务的时候，他就常常告诫他的伙伴：“机器这东西就是怪，摸准了它的脾气它可依着你；要是掌握不住它，反过来它就整你。”
    不久以前我访问他的时候，他有条不紊地给我讲了一些学习过程和工作经验。他的苦心钻研的态度给我留下极深刻的印象。
