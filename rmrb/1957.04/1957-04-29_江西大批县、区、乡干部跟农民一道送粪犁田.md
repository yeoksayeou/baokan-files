Put aside airs, change work style, go to the fields for production, and connect with the masses.

Editor's Note: The excellent work style of agricultural cooperative cadres participating in and leading production has been promoted throughout the country. County and district cadres participating in production is only beginning to be implemented in a few areas. Although some people have doubts about county and district cadres participating in productive labor, facts have proven that this is very necessary and should be promoted. The article written by Li Youwen, Deputy County Head of Nanzheng County, Shaanxi Province, powerfully proves that after county and district cadres participate in agricultural production, the relationship between cadres and farmers is closer, the leadership style is improved, and the masses quickly change their past perception of cadres as "unable to carry or lift, earning tens of yuan a month, living comfortably."

Today, this newspaper also published two very gratifying news items: one is that many senior PLA officers are participating in productive labor in support of farmers striving for a bumper harvest; the other is that cadres from Anhui Province's organizations are participating in sideline production, with Provincial Party Secretary Li Shinong and Deputy Director of the Organization Department Tao Junan going to the fields to grow vegetables. These are all good beginnings for overcoming bureaucracy, improving leadership style, and closely connecting with the masses. It is equally worthy of promotion for Party, government, and military cadres above the provincial level to participate in certain productive labor in various different ways.

    Jiangxi Province: Large Numbers of County, District, and Township Cadres Join Farmers in Delivering Manure and Plowing Fields

    (By our Newspaper) In the midst of spring production, large numbers of county, district, township, and cooperative cadres in Jiangxi Province are participating in production and leading production.

    From southern Jiangxi to northern Jiangxi, one can see county, district, and township cadres assigned to agricultural cooperatives working alongside members in the fields and in front of and behind villages, delivering manure, collecting manure, repairing water conservancy projects, and plowing fields. County Party Secretaries of Xingguo, Ruijin, Longnan, and other counties have participated in scraping sod, sweeping garbage, and picking up manure, and many grassroots cadres have also bought labor manuals to record the work points they have earned. The County Party Secretary, County Head, Public Security Bureau Chief, Court President, Supply and Marketing Cooperative Director, and heads of various bureaus of the County People's Committee in Fenyi County have all participated in the work of collecting and delivering manure for agricultural cooperatives. In Jinxi County, cadres at the county, district, and township levels have accumulated more than 10,000 dan of fertilizer in the past two months. The vast majority of agricultural cooperative cadres in Yichun County have made work plans, and national agricultural labor model agricultural cooperative directors Peng Guangxian, Huang Yongtai, and others often produce together with cooperative members. According to incomplete statistics from five districts in Gan County recently, among the eighty-eight district cadres sent to the countryside, thirty-eight have already implemented the "three togethers" (eat, live, and labor together) with the masses; in three hundred and seventy-six cooperatives, cadres in three hundred and thirty-five cooperatives have participated in productive labor.

    In Gongxi Township, Le'an County, many members of agricultural cooperatives once thought that "cadres only know how to talk, not how to do." Now, everything has changed. Luo Ruilong, a member of the Liantang Agricultural Cooperative, was moved when he saw cooperative director Xu Wansheng going to the fields to produce just like him, and said, "The director has to manage the work of the entire cooperative and also engage in production, he is really worried." Since the cadres participated in production, production in the township has progressed more rapidly than before. Huang Yongtai, director of the Wuxing Agricultural Cooperative in Yichun County, worked with cooperative members during the day and went deep into the teams and groups in the evening to help solve specific problems, and the attendance rate of cooperative members reached 98%.

    After cadres participated in production, they promptly helped agricultural cooperatives solve many problems. For example, Zhang Zhian, a member of the Yichun County Party Committee, went to the Xiaojiang Agricultural Cooperative in Xicun District and found that the cooperative had little fertilizer and the members said there was no fertilizer to accumulate. He directly participated in production, had heart-to-heart talks with old farmers in the fields, learned that there were sixteen sources of fertilizer, and mobilized cooperative members to accumulate more than 19,000 dan of fertilizer in five days. Xie Zhaoxiang, Secretary of the Longgang District Party Committee of Xingguo County, repaired water conservancy projects with members of the Longgang Agricultural Cooperative and found that some members were unwilling to work because the cooperative owed them four fen per labor day and more than 70,000 jin of increased grain were stored in the cooperative's warehouse without being distributed; he helped the cooperative solve this problem, and the number of members working on water conservancy repairs immediately increased. When Xu Wansheng, director of the Liantang Agricultural Cooperative in Gongxi Township, Le'an County, participated in production in the cooperative's youth production team, he found that the members wanted to change the ten mu of land that had been successfully converted from late rice to early rice last year back to late rice, and did not plan to convert the forty mu of land that could be converted to double-cropping rice. After discussing with the members, he opened up the members' minds and expanded the cooperative's double-cropping rice planting plan by 340 mu.

### 江西大批县、区、乡干部跟农民一道送粪犁田

    放下架子　改变作风　下地生产　联系群众
    编者按：农业生产合作社的干部参加生产、领导生产的优良作风已经在全国各地推广了。县区干部参加生产，还只在少数地区开始实行。虽然有一些人对县区干部参加生产劳动抱着怀疑的态度，但是事实证明，这样作是十分必要的，是应该加以提倡的。陕西省南郑县副县长李有温写的文章，就有力地证明了县区干部参加农业生产以后，密切了干部和农民的关系，改进了领导作风，群众很快改变了过去对干部“肩不能挑，手不能拿，一月赚几十元，很舒服”的看法。
    今天本报还发表了两个十分可喜的消息，一个是许多解放军高级军官在支援农民争取大丰收中参加生产劳动；一个是安徽省机关干部参加副业生产，省委书记李世农、组织部副部长陶均安都下地种菜。这些都是克服官僚主义、改进领导作风、密切联系群众的一个良好开端。省以上的党、政、军干部用各种不同的方式，参加一定的生产劳动，也是同样值得提倡的。
    江西大批县、区、乡干部跟农民一道送粪犁田
    本报讯　春季生产中，江西省各地大批县、区、乡、社干部参加生产，领导生产。
    从赣南到赣北，都可以看到被派驻在农业社里的县、区、乡干部，在田间和村前村后和社员们一起送粪、拾粪、修水利、犁田的情景。兴国、瑞金、龙南等县的县委书记都曾参加铲草皮、扫垃圾、拣粪，许多基层干部还买了劳动手册，把所做的工分记上。分宜县中共县委书记、县长、公安局长、法院院长、供销社主任，以及县人民委员会各局局长，都参加了农业社的拾粪、送粪工作。进贤县两个月以来，县、区、乡干部所积肥料达一万多担。宜春县绝大部分农业社干部，都订了出工计划，全国农业劳动模范、农业社主任彭光贤、黄永太等，经常和社员在一起生产。据赣县五个区最近的不完全统计：在下乡的八十八名区干部中，有三十八名已经实行了与群众同吃、同住、同劳动；在三百七十六个社中，已有三百三十五个社的社干部参加了生产劳动。
    乐安县公溪乡有许多农业社社员曾认为“干部只会说，不会做”。现在全变了，莲塘农业社社员罗瑞龙看到社主任许晚生和自己一样下田生产，感动得说：“主任要掌握好全社工作，又要生产，真操心。”从干部参加生产后，全乡生产进展比以往迅速。宜春县五星农业社主任黄永太白天和社员一起生产，晚上深入队、组帮助解决具体问题，社员出勤率达98％。
    干部参加生产以后，及时帮助农业社解决了许多问题。例如：中共宜春县委委员张治安下到西村区小江农业社，发现社里的肥料少，社员又说无肥可积。他便直接参加生产，和老农在田间谈心，了解到有十六种肥源，发动社员在五天内积肥料一万九千多担。中共兴国县龙岗区区委书记谢兆祥在龙岗农业社和社员一道修水利，发现部分社员不愿出工，是因为社里欠每个劳动日四分钱，另有七万多斤增产的粮食存在社的仓库里未分；他帮助社内解决了这个问题，社员出工修水利的立即多了起来。乐安县公溪乡莲塘农业社主任许晚生在社的青年生产队参加生产时，发现社员想把去年晚稻改早稻成功的十亩田又改种晚稻，四十亩可改双季稻的田也不打算改，经过同社员商量，打通了社员思想，使全社种植双季稻计划扩大了三百四十亩。
