Currently, in the work of organizing the production and supply of small farm tools in various regions, there is a common difficulty in the lack of raw materials such as steel, bamboo, wood, hemp, and palm. According to statistics from various regions of Heilongjiang Province and six counties in Liaoning Province, such as Haicheng and Gaiping, these areas need more than 510,000 various iron shovels for spring plowing this year, of which the raw materials for more than 417,000 have not been resolved. Yingde County, Guangdong Province, needs 100,000 jin of white pig iron to make plowshares, and 70,000 jin are still missing. There is also a shortage of production raw materials such as hemp, bamboo, wood, and palm. In Xinqiao District, Gaoyao County, Guangdong Province, there are more than 10,000 handicraft workers and farmers who rely on weaving for a living. Production has been in a state of semi-paralysis due to the lack of bamboo. Twenty counties in Heilongjiang and Liaoning provinces need a total of more than 1.4 million jin of rope loops this year, with a shortage of 1.13 million jin of hemp.

How can we solve the difficulty of insufficient raw material supply for small farm tools? The most effective method is to "obtain materials locally" and tap into local sources of goods from various aspects. Supply and marketing cooperatives and handicraft cooperatives in some areas of Liaoning, Guangdong, Guangxi, Shandong, Shanxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Jiangxi provinces have adopted some relatively good methods for solving the problem of raw materials for small farm tools.

Some supply and marketing cooperatives, in addition to improving their own operating methods, also mobilize small vendors to go to the countryside to collect waste materials from door to door. Supply and marketing cooperatives in Changtu, Faku, and other counties in Liaoning Province mobilized employees to go deep into farmers' homes to collect waste materials, and collected a total of 435,000 jin of waste raw and cooked iron in one month, which ensured the raw materials for plowshares. The Hongshaba Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Fengzhen County, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, convened a meeting of member representatives, mobilized them to come up with ideas and tap potential, and found more than 4,000 jin of various scrap iron. In addition to using blackboards, advertisements, and market day broadcasts to publicize the benefits of selling scrap steel to farmers, the Chifeng County Supply and Marketing Cooperative also sent cadres to organs, enterprises, rural areas, and streets to find waste materials, and collected 74,000 jin of scrap iron in thirteen days. Some areas in Guangdong, Guangxi, and other provinces organized small rural vendors to go deep into farmers' homes to supply goods and collect scrap steel at the same time, which was very popular among the masses.

Some areas attach great importance to repairing and utilizing old small farm tools. The Liaocheng Special District of Shandong Province organized 399 ovens to go deep into agricultural cooperatives to repair farm tools. From February 10th to March 2nd, they repaired more than 81,000 pieces of various broken small farm tools for farmers. The Daheba District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Sinan County, Guizhou Province, helped iron and wood handicraft cooperatives organize fifteen farm tool repair and processing groups. Laibin County, Guangxi Province, after popularizing the method of repairing rotten moon scrapers by advanced producers of Liangjiang Iron Works, the repaired old moon scrapers were as good as the newly made ones. Using these methods not only solved the difficulty of insufficient raw materials, but also saved farmers the funds for purchasing small farm tools.

Some areas have adopted the methods of "barter" and "mutual adjustment of surpluses and deficiencies." Xintang, Yonghe, and other agricultural cooperatives in Zengcheng County, Guangdong Province, exchanged more than 2,000 jin of old iron for a batch of small farm tools. (Editor's note: "Barter" can only be used as an auxiliary method and cannot be used as the main business method of supply and marketing cooperatives. For those who have old iron and need to buy farm tools, they can be mobilized to "barter"; for those who do not have old iron but also need to buy farm tools, they should be supplied as usual.) The basic-level supply and marketing cooperatives in Faku County, Liaoning Province, used methods such as exchanging goods for iron, and recovered a total of 90,000 jin of pig iron. The supply and marketing cooperatives in various districts of Suiyang County, Guizhou Province, used the method of mutual adjustment of surpluses and deficiencies to adjust 15,000 jin of raw iron and raw plate iron, 75,000 bamboo hats, and 300 palm raincoats. Some areas also organized agricultural cooperatives to mutually adjust small farm tools, or organized various cooperatives to take out their surplus products and raw materials for exchange through internal exchange meetings of supply and marketing cooperatives and handicraft cooperatives.

Using substitutes is also a good way to solve the shortage of raw materials. The supply and marketing cooperative in Heishan County, Liaoning Province, was short of hemp, and farmers needed rope loops. The county supply and marketing cooperative, under the principle of ensuring the quality of rope loops, mixed a certain proportion of broken cloth strips and cotton stalk skins into the hemp, reducing the amount of big hemp and green hemp by more than 24,000 jin, which solved the difficulty of insufficient hemp supply. Now Heilongjiang Province has purchased 4 million jin of cotton stalk skins from Hebei Province, and plans to use it to replace the hemp for making rope loops. The supply and marketing cooperatives in various counties of the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province use palm fibers and mountain grass instead of palm bark to make raincoats. More than 50,000 pieces have been made, the quality is not low, and the price is very cheap.

    小农具的原料不足怎么办
    曾映泉　韩炳离
    目前各地在组织小农具的生产和供应工作中，普遍存在缺乏钢铁、竹、木、麻、棕等原料的困难。据黑龙江省各地和辽宁省海城、盖平等六个县的统计，这些地区今年春耕时共需要各种铁锹五十一万多把，其中有四十一万七千多把的原料未得到解决。广东英德县打犁头需用白口生铁十万斤，还有七万斤没有着落。麻、竹、木、棕等生产原料，也很缺乏。广东高要县新桥区，依靠编织为生的手工业者和农民有一万多人，因竹子缺乏，生产已陷于半停顿状态。黑龙江、辽宁两省二十个县，今年共需绳套一百四十多万斤，缺麻一百十三万斤。
    怎样解决小农具原料供应不足的困难呢？最有效的方法就是“就地取材”，从多方面挖掘本地区的货源。辽宁、广东、广西、山东、山西、云南、贵州、江西等省部分地区的供销社和手工业社，已采用了一些比较好的解决小农具原料的方法。
    有些供销合作社除改进自己的经营方法外，还发动小商贩深入农村串门收购废料。辽宁省昌图、法库等县供销社，发动职工深入农户收购废料，在一个月内共收废生熟铁四十三万五千斤，使犁铧的原料有了着落。内蒙古自治区丰镇县红砂坝供销社，通过召开社员代表大会，发动社员代表想办法、挖潜力，找到各种废铁四千余斤。赤峰县供销社除利用黑板报、广告、集日广播等形式向农民宣传卖废钢铁的好处外，还派干部分赴机关、企业、农村和街道寻找废料，在十三天内就收购了废铁七万四千斤。广东、广西等省有些地区，组织农村小商贩深入农户，一面供应商品，一面收购废钢铁，很受群众欢迎。
    有些地区很重视修补、利用旧有小农具。山东聊城专区组织烘炉三百九十九盘，深入到农业社修补农具，从2月10日到3月2日，共替农民修理各种破烂的小农具八万一千多件。贵州思南县大河坝区供销社，帮助铁、木手工业社组织了十五个农具修补加工组。广西省来宾县，推广良江铁业社先进生产者修整烂月刮的方法后，修整后的旧月刮和新打的一样好用。用这些办法，不但解决了原料不足的困难，农民也节省了购买小农具的资金。
    有些地区采用了“以货换货”和“互相调剂余缺”的方法。广东增城县新塘、永和等农业社拿旧铁二千多斤，换回一批小农具。（编者按：“以货换货”只能作为一种辅助方法，不能作为供销社的主要的营业方法。对于有旧铁而又需要买农具的人，可以动员他“以货换货”；对于没有旧铁也要买农具的人，就应该照样供应。）辽宁省法库县基层供销社用以货换铁等方法，共回收生铁九万斤。贵州绥阳县各区供销社，用相互调剂余缺的方法，调剂了毛铁、生板铁一万五千斤，斗笠七万五千个，棕衣三百件。有些地区还组织农业社相互调剂小农具，或通过供销社、手工业社的内部交流会，组织各社把多余的产品和原料拿出交流。
    采用代用品，也是解决原料不足的一个好办法。辽宁省黑山县缺麻，农民又需要绳套，该县供销社便在保证绳套质量的原则下，在麻中掺入一定比例的破布条和棉秆皮，共减少了大麻和青麻二万四千多斤，解决了麻供应不足的困难。现在黑龙江省已从河北省购进棉秆皮四百万斤，准备用它代替制绳套的麻。云南大理白族自治州各县供销社，用棕芭子和山草代替棕皮做蓑衣，现已做好五万多件，质量不低，价格很便宜。
