Hangzhou Saved Public Fabric Last Month
	Can Make 10,000 Sets of Zhongshan Suits

	(Our Newspaper) News: Hangzhou City’s public fabric supply in March was 145,400 chi less than the sales in January. The cotton cloth saved can make 10,000 sets of Zhongshan suits.

	Since the call for "saving fabric" was put forward, many administrative, public institutions, and enterprises have tried every means to save fabric. For example, the Wulin Slaughterhouse originally planned to add a batch of work clothes, but now they used the discarded work clothes from the past to remake more than 300 pairs of work shorts, saving this batch of cotton cloth. After cleaning the warehouse, the Hangzhou Cotton Textile Factory sorted out a batch of work bags left over from 1951, and continued to use them after dyeing. In the past, the soy sauce bags used by the brewery were discarded as soon as they had holes. Now, they conduct regular inspections and repair them in time for use, saving 300 chi of cotton cloth in the first quarter. Other factories, such as Huaou Sugar Factory and Jianxin Chemical Factory, also actively use flour bags and alkali bags to remake work clothes.

    杭州上月节约的公用布
    可以做一万套中山装
    本报讯　杭州市3月份的公共用布供应量比1月份少销十四万五千四百尺。这些节省下来的棉布，可做一万套中山装。
    自从提出“节约用布”的号召以后，许多行政、事业、企业单位都想尽各种办法来节省用布。如武林屠宰场原来要增添一批工作服，现在他们利用过去已报废的工作服，改制了三百多条工作短裤，把这批棉布节省下来。杭州棉纺织厂清理仓库后，整理出一批1951年留下来的工作袋，经过加染继续使用。酿造厂过去使用的酱油袋，一有破洞就丢弃了。现在做到定期检查，及时补修使用，第一季度已节省棉布三百尺。其他如华欧制糖厂、建新化工厂等也积极利用面粉袋、碱袋改制工作服。
