Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 19th: French transportation and municipal workers, who launched a 48-hour warning strike on the 16th to demand higher wages, ended the strike on the 18th as originally planned. Before the end of the strike, more than a thousand striking workers in Paris held a demonstration in front of the Public Works and Transportation Building.

The workers' demonstration was unreasonably obstructed by the police. Workers clashed with the police. The police used tear gas, water cannons, and batons to disperse the workers. Many workers were injured. The police also arrested a number of workers. Workers resisted with stones and sticks. Some police were also injured.

This warning strike, involving 400,000 railway workers, inland waterway transport workers, Paris subway and bus workers, and airline ground staff, was the largest since August 1953.

“France-Soir” estimates that the two-day strike has already cost capitalists 10 billion to 15 billion francs (approximately $28 million to $42 million). The railway workers' strike reduced the railway administration's revenue by $6 million.

    法国运输工人结束警告性罢工
    两天中使资方损失百多亿法郎
    新华社19日讯　巴黎消息：法国运输工人和市政工人为要求增加工资而从16日起发动的四十八小时的警告性罢工，已经在18日照原定计划结束。在结束之前，巴黎一千多名罢工工人在公共工程和运输大楼前举行了示威。
    工人的示威受到警察的无理阻挠。工人同警察发生了冲突。警察用催泪毒气、水龙头和警棍来驱散工人。许多工人受伤。警察还逮捕了不少工人。工人用石块和棍子进行抵抗。警察也有受伤的。
    这次有四十万铁路工人、内河航运工人、巴黎地下电车工人和公共汽车工人、航空公司地勤人员参加的警告性罢工，是1953年8月以来规模最大的一次。
    “法兰西晚报”估计，两天的罢工已经使资方损失一百亿到一百五十亿法郎（约合二千八百万到四千二百万美元）。铁路工人的罢工使铁路管理局减少了六百万美元的收入。
