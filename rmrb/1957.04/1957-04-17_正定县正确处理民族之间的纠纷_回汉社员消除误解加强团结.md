	Zhengding County Correctly Handles Ethnic Disputes
	Hui and Han Commune Members Eliminate Misunderstandings and Strengthen Unity

	(Our Newspaper) News item: Zhengding County, Hebei Province, has correctly handled the relationship between the Hui and Han ethnic groups, strengthening unity between the nationalities.

	The agricultural production cooperative in Chengguan Town is composed of Hui and Han people. Because the Hui and Han ethnic groups have different customs and habits, commune members often have differing opinions on raising pigs for fertilizer within the cooperative. Han commune members wanted to raise more pigs and accumulate more fertilizer, while Hui commune members felt that grain grown with pig manure would not be suitable for Hui people to eat. Also, the pigs often ran into the Hui people's homes because the caretakers were not managing them strictly. This not only affected the cooperative's production increase plan, but more importantly, it affected the consolidation of the cooperative and the unity of the Hui and Han commune members. The deputy chairman of the county's political consultative conference invited the deputy county chief of the county people's committee and cadres from the United Front Work Department of the CCP county committee to conduct extensive research. They held multiple consultations within the cooperative to propagate and explain ethnic policies and convened Hui people's symposiums to discuss Ma Jian's "Answers to Several Questions Regarding Pigs." Hui commune members believed that Comrade Ma Jian's answers were based on "the Hadith" and "analogy" and should be followed. Therefore, the issue was appropriately resolved by allowing Hui people to raise sheep while Han people could raise pigs and universally apply fertilizer. This paved the way for the cooperative to formulate a production increase plan and strive for a bumper harvest.

	Niujiazhuang Village in the north of the county town is a Han agricultural production cooperative. In order to expand the production area, commune members plowed and damaged many graves adjacent to the Hui people of Chengguan Town, causing dissatisfaction among the Hui people. The Hui people requested the Niujiazhuang cooperative to repair the graves, but the commune members of the village insisted on not repairing them. After the county leaders patiently educated the Niujiazhuang commune members, they realized the importance of implementing ethnic policies and examined the harm of Han chauvinism. Then, the village mobilized some commune members to not only repair the plowed and damaged graves, but also used large carts to haul soil and repair all the collapsed graves. The Hui people were deeply moved by the actions of the Han commune members and automatically contributed money to make a mirrored plaque with the words "Flower of Ethnic Friendship" written on it, which they presented to the Han commune members. At the same time, they sent four representatives and invited the county leaders to hold a get-together in Niujiazhuang. Rong Bin, the Imam of the mosque, gave a thank-you speech: "This get-together was unimaginable in the old society. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party can we have today's Hui and Han people's get-together. We must strengthen this unity in the future." (Wang Shantang)

    正定县正确处理民族之间的纠纷
    回汉社员消除误解加强团结
    本报讯　河北省正定县正确处理回、汉民族之间的关系，加强了民族之间的团结。
    城关镇的农业生产合作社，是回、汉民联合组成的。因为回、汉民族风俗习惯不同，社员对社内养猪积肥一事，常常发生意见分岐。汉民社员要求多养猪多积肥，回民社员认为施猪肥生长的粮食，回民吃不合适，并且常常由于饲养员管理不严，猪跑到回民家去。这不仅影响社的增产计划不能实现，更重要的是影响到社的巩固和回、汉民社员的团结。该县政协副主席曾邀集县人民委员会副县长和中共县委统战部的干部作了多方研究，在社内进行了多次协商，宣传解释民族政策；召开了回民座谈会，讨论了马坚写的“关于猪的几个问题的解答”。回民社员认为马坚同志所解答的问题是以“圣训”“比论”作依据的，应当遵守。因此，适当地解决了回民养羊、汉民养猪可以普遍施肥的问题。给该社订立增产计划争取农业大丰收开辟了道路。
    该县城北牛家庄村是汉民农业生产合作社。社员为了扩大生产面积，把同城关镇回民毗邻的坟墓犁小、犁坏很多，引起了回民群众的不满。回民向牛家庄社提出了修整坟墓的要求。而该村社员坚持不修。经该县领导方面对牛家庄社员进行了耐心的教育，牛家庄社员认识了贯彻民族政策的重要意义，还检查了大汉族主义思想的危害。然后，该村动员了一部分社员，不但把犁坏、犁小的坟墓修好了，并用大车拉土把其它塌坏的坟也全部修起来。回民群众见到汉民社员这一行动，深为感动，自动凑款制了一块镜匾，上写“民族友谊之花”，送给汉民社员。同时派出四位代表并邀请了县的领导人员到牛家庄举行了联欢会。清真寺阿訇荣斌致谢词说：“这次联欢会，是旧社会梦想不到的，只有在共产党的领导下，才有今天回、汉民的联欢，我们今后定要加强这种团结。”　（王善堂）
