Striving for a bumper cotton harvest is a major task in striving for a national agricultural bumper harvest in 1957. As people's living standards improve, the consumption of cotton is constantly increasing; the development of the textile industry also requires more cotton. Since liberation, China's cotton production has increased significantly. However, compared with the demand, it is still insufficient. In 1956, cotton suffered severe natural disasters and failed to complete the original production increase plan, increasing the tension in the supply of cotton and cotton textiles. Therefore, we must strive to achieve a bumper cotton harvest this year.
    The state's planned target for cotton production increase in 1957 requires a total output of 33 million dan of ginned cotton, an increase of approximately 10% compared to 1956, and an increase of 8.7% compared to the bumper harvest of 1955. To accomplish this task, efforts must be made in two aspects. On the one hand, the planned cotton planting area must be guaranteed; on the other hand, every effort must be made to increase the yield per unit area. The average yield per unit area of cotton fields nationwide in 1957 is required to increase by 13.1% compared to 1956. Based on the law of increasing cotton field yield per unit area over the years, this year's task is quite arduous. However, as long as we work hard, it is still possible to achieve or even exceed it. In recent years, some advanced production units in various parts of China have achieved bumper cotton yields, exceeding the general average yield by two or three times, and even individually reaching more than ten times. These all demonstrate that China has great potential for increasing cotton field yield per unit area.
    On the basis of cooperativization, actively promoting advanced experiences and improving cotton planting techniques are the main ways to strive for a bumper cotton harvest. In 1956, the broad cotton-growing areas learned from the advanced cotton production experience of various regions, implemented advanced techniques such as earlier sowing dates, increased plant density, early thinning, early cultivation, early application of topdressing fertilizers in stages, and strengthened pruning, and launched a large-scale bumper harvest campaign. Therefore, although last year suffered severe natural disasters, many places still achieved large-scale bumper harvests, and many "hundred-jin townships" and "hundred-jin cooperatives" emerged. Cotton-growing areas that were not affected by disasters or suffered less, such as Shaanxi, Hubei, Shandong, Liaoning, Xinjiang, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Yunnan provinces, saw an increase in the average cotton yield of the entire province by more than 10%, and some by more than 40%. Last year, some areas did not achieve good results in promoting advanced cotton planting techniques. This was mainly due to mechanical application and over-hasty promotion. In order to strive for a bumper cotton harvest this year, we must further improve cotton planting techniques, determine the main technical improvement measures for increasing cotton production in various places based on last year's experience, and better combine them with the specific conditions of different regions, adapting to local conditions and times for promotion.
    Cotton production is likely to encounter more natural disasters. Last year, more than 8 million mu of cotton fields were abandoned due to flooding, and another 20 to 30 million mu suffered severe yield reductions due to flooding and wind damage. This is the main reason for failing to complete the production increase plan. To ensure a bumper cotton harvest this year, we must vigorously overcome disasters such as waterlogging, drought, diseases, and insect pests. We must pay attention to adjusting cotton fields that were originally prone to waterlogging in heavy soil and low-lying areas to land suitable for cotton planting. In addition to paying attention to appropriate irrigation in the northern cotton-growing areas to overcome drought during cotton sowing and growth, we must also pay attention to drainage and flood prevention during the concentrated rainfall period from July to September. Although there is a lot of rain in the south, drought is often encountered during the vigorous growth period of cotton, so attention should be paid to irrigation during the drought period. For cotton diseases and insect pests, we must conscientiously implement the principles of timely treatment, continuous treatment, and thorough treatment. In the past, northern cotton-growing areas paid more attention to the prevention and control of early-stage cotton pests, but paid less attention to late-stage pests, which is not good. In fact, the harm of late-stage pests is also very serious and should be paid attention to.
    Improving cotton planting techniques includes a series of comprehensive technical operations. Attention must be paid to the correct coordination of various technical operations, without relaxing any link. In particular, it is necessary to strengthen the cultivation and management work during the entire growth period to ensure increased production. Generally, cotton-growing areas pay close attention to cotton field sowing and seedling management, but gradually relax in the mid- and late stages, which has a great impact on increasing production and should be corrected. Many improved animal-powered seeders and cultivators have been tested in various places and have achieved good results. They should continue to be promoted and used this year.
    In order to strengthen the guidance of cotton planting techniques, technical extension stations and scientific research units in various places should actively guide and help agricultural cooperatives in various cotton-growing areas summarize last year's experience, absorb the experience of local experienced farmers, and, through democratic discussions within the cooperative, formulate plans for further improving cotton planting techniques and striving for bumper cotton yields this year, adapting to local conditions, and conscientiously implement them. Last year, many agricultural cooperatives conducted bumper harvest field experiments within the cooperative and gained many specific experiences, which should be well summarized and applied. In short, all localities should take various active measures to increase cotton production this year.
    The key to ensuring increased cotton production this year is to strengthen leadership. According to the situation reflected in the cotton production reporting meeting recently held by the Ministry of Agriculture, the cotton planting area and production increase targets this year do not yet meet the state's requirements in some cotton-producing areas. Most agricultural cooperatives only have targets for cotton production this year, but no specific measures to guarantee increased production. Some key cooperatives have begun to formulate production increase measures, but they are disconnected from the cooperative's production plan. These problems must be strengthened in leadership and inspection, and specific assistance must be provided to solve them.
    The cotton sowing season has arrived. All localities must seize the time to do a good job in preparing the land and conserving soil moisture before sowing. This year, more than 10 million mu of cotton fields will be replaced with new improved varieties. All localities must make early arrangements for seed allocation and guide seed selection to improve seed quality. The insecticides, machinery, commercial fertilizers, and improved agricultural implements needed for cotton production increase must be planned, prepared, and supplied in a timely manner. In order to remedy the insufficient amount of base fertilizer applied to cotton fields this year, we must step up spring manure accumulation and fertilizer production, and prepare commercial fertilizers for cotton fields as early as possible. From the cotton seedling establishment period to the flowering period, quick-acting commercial fertilizers and well-decomposed farmyard manure should be applied to cotton fields in stages.

    争取今年棉花丰收
    增产棉花，是争取1957年全国农业大丰收中一项重大任务。人民群众由于生活有了改善，对棉花的消费在不断地增长；纺织工业的发展，也要求更多的棉花。解放以来，我国的棉花产量有了很大的增长。但是和需要比起来，还是不足的。1956年棉花受到较重的自然灾害，没有完成原定的增产计划，增加了棉花和棉织品供应上的紧张程度。因此，我们必须努力争取今年棉花的大丰收。
    1957年国家对棉花增产的计划指标，要求皮棉总产量达到三千三百万担，比1956年约增加10％，比丰收的1955年也提高8.7％。为完成这个任务，必须从两方面努力。一方面，要保证计划的植棉面积；另一方面，要想尽一切办法提高单位面积产量。1957年全国棉田的平均单位面积产量，要求比1956年提高13.1％。根据历年来棉田提高单位面积产量的规律，今年的任务是相当艰巨的。但是只要努力去做，也还是可能达到甚至超过的。我国近几年来各地一些先进生产单位取得的棉花丰产成绩，比一般的平均产量超过两三倍甚至个别的达到十倍以上。这些都说明我国提高棉田单位产量有很大的潜力。
    在合作化的基础上，积极地推广先进的经验，提高植棉技术，是争取棉花丰产的主要途径。1956年广大棉区学习了各先进地区的棉花丰产经验，推行了提早播种期、增加植株密度、早间苗、早中耕、分期早施追肥、加强整枝等先进技术，开展了大面积丰产运动，所以去年虽然遭受很重的自然灾害，仍有许多地方得到大面积丰产，并出现了许多百斤乡和百斤社。去年没有受灾或受灾较轻的棉区，如陕西、湖北、山东、辽宁、新疆、湖南、江西、云南等省，全省棉花平均产量都比过去提高10％以上，多的提高40％以上。去年也有部分地区推行先进的植棉技术得到不好的结果，这主要是由于机械搬用和推行过急。为了争取今年棉花大丰收，必须进一步改进植棉技术，根据去年的经验来确定各地增产棉花的主要技术改进措施，更好地结合不同地区的具体条件，因地制宜、因时制宜地加以推广。
    棉花生产方面可能遇到的自然灾害比较多。去年因受涝而废弃的棉田有八百多万亩，因受到涝害和风害而严重减产的还有二、三千万亩。这是不能完成增产计划的主要原因。为了保证今年棉花丰产，必须大力克服水、旱、病、虫等灾害。必须注意把原来在粘重土壤和低洼地区容易受涝的棉田调整到宜棉的土地上去，北方棉区除了要注意适当灌溉，克服棉花播种和生长期间的干旱以外，在七至九月雨水集中的时期，也要注意排水防涝。南方虽然雨水多，但是在棉花生育盛期往往也会遇到伏旱，所以要注意伏旱期间的灌溉。对于棉花的病虫害，必须切实贯彻及时治、连续治、彻底治的方针。北方棉区过去对棉花前期虫害的防治比较重视，但是对后期虫害却不太注意，这是不好的，实际上后期虫害的为害也很严重，应当注意防治。
    提高植棉技术，包括一系列综合性的技术作业，必须注意各项技术作业的正确配合，不放松任何一个环节。特别要加强整个生长期间的栽培管理工作，才能保证增产。一般棉区对棉田播种和苗期管理比较抓的紧，而到了中期、后期便逐步放松，对增产影响很大，应当纠正。各地有许多种经过改良的畜力播种器和中耕器，试用效果很好，今年应该继续推广使用。
    为了加强植棉技术的指导工作，各地技术推广站和科学研究单位要积极地指导并帮助各地植棉的农业社总结去年经验，吸取当地老农的经验，通过社内民主讨论，因地制宜地订出今年进一步提高植棉技术、争取棉田丰产的计划，切实贯彻实施。去年不少农业社在社内进行了丰产田试验，取得许多具体的经验，应该很好地加以总结和应用。总之，各地要采取各种积极措施，提高今年棉花的产量。
    保证今年棉花增产的关键，是加强领导。据农业部最近召开的棉花生产汇报会议反映的情况，今年的植棉面积和增产指标，在部分产棉区还不符合国家的要求。大部分农业社对今年棉花生产的计划只有指标，而没有保证增产的具体措施。有些重点社虽然开始定出增产措施，但是又和社的生产计划脱节，这些问题都必须加强领导和检查，具体帮助解决。
    棉花的播种季节已经来到了。各地必须抓紧做好播种前的整地保墒工作。今年有一千多万亩棉田将换用新的良种，各地要及早做好种子调配工作，并指导粒选，提高种子质量。对于棉花增产所需要的治虫药械、商品肥料及改良农具等，都要有计划地做好准备，及时供应。为了补救今年棉田施用基肥量的不足，要加紧春季积肥造肥工作，并及早准备棉田施用的商品肥料。在棉花定苗后到开花期间，要用速效的商品肥料和腐熟的农家肥料，分期增施棉田追肥。
