Xinhua News Agency, April 12th: The Sixth Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee of the China Democratic Party, which concluded today, called on its members to further exert the role of party organizations in the face of the new situation, expand socialist democracy, and correctly handle contradictions among the people in order to mobilize all positive factors for the socialist cause. The meeting was held from the 8th to the 12th. According to the spirit of Chairman Mao Zedong's speech on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, all participants in the meeting focused on discussing how to further implement the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" in the future.

After full discussion, the meeting adopted a political resolution. The resolution stated that the proposal of the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" has increased our political responsibility. In order to correctly implement this policy, the resolution requires members of the China Democratic Party to loyally accept the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, adhere to the political line of serving socialism, and play a creative role in the country's political life. Party organizations at all levels should regularly reflect the opinions and demands of members and the masses to relevant parties, represent and support their legitimate interests, assist leaders at all levels to better implement the policies of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, and assist in correctly handling contradictions among the people. The resolution requires all members to actively offer suggestions and criticisms to the Communist Party in the spirit of being responsible for the socialist cause, and at the same time, to actively and humbly accept the supervision of the Chinese Communist Party, other democratic parties, and the people.

The resolution stated that strengthening political and ideological education and helping members and the masses they are in contact with to carry out self-reform is an important way to raise socialist awareness and handle contradictions among the people. They should be helped to consciously study the theory of Marxism-Leninism, and encouraged to learn from workers and peasants in their work practice, observation of social life, and practice, and gradually become complete socialist intellectuals. The resolution emphasized that at present, we should focus on educating people to subordinate personal interests to socialist interests, draw a clear line between socialist democracy and capitalist democracy, distinguish right from wrong, and gradually improve the level of political thought.

The resolution also called for further implementation of the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" in the future, calling on all personnel to give full play to the spirit of independent thinking, open their minds, freely debate, adhere to the truth, correct mistakes, and fully exert socialist labor enthusiasm to advance towards science and culture.

The meeting elected Huang Qixiang as Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic Party.

    中国农工民主党举行六届三中全会
    着重讨论了“长期共存、互相监督”的方针
    据新华社12日讯今天结束的中国农工民主党第六届中央委员会第三次全体会议，要求它的成员在新的形势面前，进一步发挥党组织的作用，为扩大社会主义民主、正确处理人民内部矛盾以动员一切积极因素为社会主义事业而努力。这次会议从8日到12日举行。参加会议的全体人员，根据毛泽东主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的讲话的精神，着重讨论了今后如何进一步贯彻“长期共存、互相监督”的方针等问题。
    经过充分讨论，会议通过了政治决议。决议说，“长期共存、互相监督”方针的提出，加重了我们的政治责任。为正确贯彻这一方针，这个决议要求农工民主党的成员必须忠诚接受中国共产党的领导，坚持为社会主义服务的政治路线，在国家的政治生活中创造性地发挥作用。各级组织要经常向有关方面反映成员和群众的意见和要求，代表和支持他们的正当利益，协助各级领导更好地贯彻中国共产党和人民政府的政策，协助正确处理人民内部的矛盾。决议要求全体成员本着对社会主义事业负责的精神，积极地向共产党提出建议和批评，同时，也要主动地、虚心地接受中国共产党以及各民主党派和人民群众对农工民主党的监督。
    决议说，加强政治思想教育，帮助成员和所联系的群众进行自我改造，是提高社会主义觉悟和处理人民内部矛盾的一个重要途径。应该帮助他们在自觉的基础上努力学习马克思列宁主义的理论，鼓励他们在工作实践、社会生活的观察和实践中，向工人和农民学习，逐步成为完全的社会主义的知识分子。决议强调指出，目前应当着重进行个人利益服从社会主义利益的教育，划清社会主义民主和资本主义民主的思想界限，明辨是非，逐步提高政治思想水平。
    决议还要求今后要进一步贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，号召全体人员发挥独立思考的精神，敞开思想，自由辩论，坚持真理，修正错误，充分发挥社会主义劳动热情，向科学文化进军。
    这次会议补选了黄琪翔为中国农工民主党中央委员会副主席。
    在这以前，中国农工民主党曾在3月26日到4月4日召开了第一次全国工作会议。4月5日到6日又召开了全国代表大会筹备委员会会议，讨论了召开中国农工民主党第七次全国代表大会的筹备工作。
