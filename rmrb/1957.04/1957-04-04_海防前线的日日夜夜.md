Days and Nights on the Coastal Defense Front
    Ye Feng
    On the coastal defense front, whenever the representatives of the Fujian People's and Fujian Front Troops Leadership Organs'慰問団慰问团 ask the officers and soldiers, "Comrades, you've worked hard!" the officers and soldiers always reply earnestly, "Serving the motherland is nothing."
    Are these People's Liberation Army officers and soldiers, who are defending the socialist construction of the motherland, really not working hard? What the reporter saw and heard on the front line shows that it is not "nothing."
    When the慰問団 was慰问团 the naval units, the reporter interviewed the艇队 that had just carried out escort missions. It was after lunch when Deputy Instructor Yin Biru led me to the landing craft舱里. We had only spoken a few words when an emergency air raid alarm sounded from the shore. The soldiers on the艇艇 were really quick; before we could climb out of the舱门, they were all at their posts, ready for battle. The艇艇 quickly left the码头 and stopped at a predetermined position on the sea, waiting to迎击 the enemy planes. At this time, I saw the artillery soldiers on the hilltop behind the码码头 also quickly turning their anti-aircraft guns. After more than ten minutes, the alarm was lifted. Yin Biru said to me, "This is very close to Matsu Island. As soon as the enemy planes take off, we have to be prepared."
    炮艇艇长 Zhao Chengji,枪炮班班长 Jiao Chengying, and others told me about the living conditions on the艇艇: This艇队 has been carrying out escort, fishing protection, and patrol missions on the Fujian front for three or four years. Every time they escort transportation船队, the clothes of the officers and soldiers on the艇艇 are soaked by the waves in a very short time after the起航. In heavy rain, the raindrops hit their faces like coarse sand. But the people on the艇艇 are still full of energy and continue to work as usual. Zhao Chengji has been working on the艇艇 for several years, and he is used to life at sea. But when sailing in large waves, he still often gets nauseous and vomits everything he has eaten. Every time they set sail, the veteran soldiers lose one or two斤斤, and those who have been on the艇艇 for a short time often lose four or five斤斤. After the艇艇 docks, the soldiers have to oil the machines and scrub the deck. Zhao Chengji said with a smile: "Our艇艇 is cool in winter and warm in summer. In winter, when it is parked in the water, it is ice-cold and涼涼涼涼; in summer, when it is hottest, if you put an egg on the deck, it will be cooked in four or five minutes. To reduce the temperature in the舱, we have to keep splashing water on the deck." I said, "You really work hard!" He immediately replied: "Our炊事员同志 and the同志 who work in the engine room really deserve the credit! The炊事员同志 often cook for us in temperatures of over 100 degrees Fahrenheit."
    One morning after a rain, representatives of the慰问团慰问团 went to a ground surveillance哨 set up on a high mountain by the sea. We were soaked in sweat before we climbed to the哨台 on the top of the mountain. On duty were哨长 Qiu Yin and哨员 Fang Zhengshan. They were both very young. Qiu Yin held his binoculars and looked at the sea and the sky with all his attention; Fang Zhengshan sat quietly next to the telephone, holding the earphones, ready to report the enemy situation to the superior command机关 at the fastest speed. After Qiu Yin handed over, we came to the place where the哨兵 lived. It was a small ancient temple, which was dark and damp. Because they could not find a house on the mountain, they lived here for three or four years. After noon, at a small座谈会, the哨兵 introduced their life. They said that last year, the哨哨 never failed to report an enemy situation, and the situation reported to the superior command机关 was 95% accurate. Everyone's study成绩 was also good, and the overall rating of the common subjects and professional subjects tests of the entire哨哨 was "good." It is not easy for them to achieve such results. In the past few years, in addition to performing heavy observation and哨哨 missions day and night, they also had to buy rice and noodles themselves and take turns cooking. Learning time was squeezed out of rest time. I interrupted and asked, "When it's cloudy and raining, you should take a break, right?" They seemed to think I was an outsider and argued, "How can that be? If we rest ourselves and let the enemy planes pass by and bomb the rear targets, we would be irresponsible to the people!"
    On February 26, some representatives and actors of the慰问团慰问团 returned from the Fourth Company with a sense of pride and said to the people who stayed at home: "You didn't go, it's a pity! We only saw the hard life of the soldiers today." What gave the representatives and actors such a deep impression? The situation is this: The officers and soldiers of the entire Fourth Company have been stationed by the sea for several years. They climb mountains, cross water, patrol, and哨哨, and fight against the特务 and "水鬼" sent by the enemy. The soldiers walk an average of fifty or sixty里路 every day. At the end of last year, Fourth Squad Leader Chen Shunxian went to Beijing to attend the representative meeting of active members of the Public Security Army. When he returned, the部队 had accepted the task of building national defense工事. The comrades-in-arms knew that Chen Shunxian had seen Chairman Mao, and they felt honored to see the pennants, photos, and other souvenirs that Chen Shunxian brought back. They made plans and expressed their determination to strive to complete the construction工事 task ahead of schedule, do a good job, and strive to send representatives to Beijing to see Chairman Mao again. The representatives of the慰问团休息了三、四次 before climbing to the hilltop where the Fourth Company was stationed, and the officers and soldiers warmly welcomed them. They saw that the officers and soldiers lived in drafty thatched houses and leaky tents when it rained, and they met the soldiers who were working. The soldiers were all bare-chested, sweat dripping from their heads, and covered in mud. Chang Zizuo,团长 of the First Detachment, held the hand of a soldier and asked after looking at it: "Does it hurt?" The soldiers replied with a smile: "The blisters that were磨磨起 at the beginning hurt a bit, but now a layer of hard skin has been磨磨出, and it doesn't hurt."
    During the several big typhoons last year, the troops on the front island experienced a serious test. Many barracks were destroyed by the wind, and things were blown away, but the officers and soldiers of the部队 did not relax their combat readiness at all. A哨兵 was blown from the mountain to the valley by the wind. After he got up, he continued to perform his duties; the roof of an observation哨 was blown away by the wind. It was raining heavily at the time, and the soldiers insisted on working under the bed.
    On March 5, the reporter went to an island very close to the enemy-occupied Dongyin, Xiyin, and Matsu Islands and interviewed a front-line squad. They had already built a thatched house themselves. On the day I arrived, it was windy and rainy, and the house leaked, and rainwater kept dripping onto the bed. The food was very cold when eating. When I asked them,班长 Lin Decheng said that for several years, they had been going to the mountain behind to打饭. The mountain was more than 300 meters high, and the slope was seventy or eighty degrees. It took an hour and a half to打饭, so the打来的饭 was cold on the way. During the typhoons last year, the老百姓 knew that they could not go up to打饭, so they sent them some地瓜米. After he talked about it, I asked: "Do you like living on the island?" Zhang Caixing, a soldier and member of the Communist Youth League who enlisted last year, immediately replied: "We came to the部队 to defend the motherland. It doesn't matter where we live. The more difficult it is, the more glorious we feel."

    海防前线的日日夜夜
    冶峰
    在海防前线，每当福建人民和福建前线部队领导机关组成的慰问团的代表们和随行的演员们问候部队军官和士兵：“同志们，辛苦了！”官兵们总是热诚地回答说：“为祖国服务，没有什么。”
    这些保卫祖国社会主义建设的解放军官兵，真的不辛苦吗？记者在前线上的见闻说明并不是“没有什么”。
    慰问团在海军部队进行慰问的时候，记者访问了刚刚执行过护航任务的艇队。那是中午饭后，副指导员殷必如领我到登陆艇舱里，坐下来只谈了几句话，岸上就传来敌机临空的紧急警报声。艇上的战士们动作真快，我们还没有爬出舱门，他们就各就各位，作好了战斗前的一切准备。艇只迅速开离码头，在海面预定的位置停下来，等候迎击敌机。这时候，我看到码头后面山顶上的炮兵战士，也迅速地转动高射炮口。过了十几分钟，警报解除了。殷必如对我说：“这儿离马祖岛很近，敌人的飞机一起飞，我们就得准备。”
    炮艇艇长赵成基、枪炮班班长焦成英等对我讲述了艇上的生活情形：这支艇队在福建前线执行护航护渔和巡逻任务已经三、四年了。每次掩护运输船队航行，起航后很短的时间里，艇上官兵们的衣服就被浪花浇湿了。遇到暴雨，雨点像粗砂一样往脸上扑打。但艇上的人仍然精神饱满，照常工作。赵成基在艇上工作好几年了，他已经习惯了海上生活。可是在大风浪中航行，他仍然常常会被颠晃得恶心，直到把吃下去的东西吐得干干净净。每出航一次，老战士的体重要减轻一、二斤，上艇不久的人，常常减轻四、五斤。艇只靠岸以后，战士们还要给机器擦油、刷洗甲板。赵成基笑着说：“我们艇上是冬凉夏暖。冬天停在水里，又冰又凉；夏天，最热的时候你把鸡蛋放在甲板上，四、五分钟就熟了。为使舱内的温度降低，要不断往甲板上泼水。”我说：“你们可真是辛苦了！”他马上回答：“我们的炊事员同志和在机舱内工作的同志才真是有功劳呢！炊事员同志常常在华氏一百多度的温度里给我们作饭。”
    一个雨后初晴的上午，慰问团代表到一个设在海边高山上的防空军地面监视哨去。我们出了一身汗才爬上山顶的哨台。正在执勤的是哨长丘吟和哨员方正山。他们两人都很年青。丘吟手拿观察镜，全神贯注地看着海面和天空；方正山静静地坐在电话机旁，抓住耳机，准备用最快的速度把敌情向上级指挥机关报告。丘吟交班以后，我们来到哨兵住的地方，这是一座小小的古庙，里面又阴暗又潮湿，因为山上山下找不到房子，他们在这儿住了三、四年。中午过后，在一次小型座谈会上，哨兵们介绍了他们的生活。他们说，去年哨上没有漏报过一次敌情，报告给上级指挥机关的情况，95％完全正确。大家的学习成绩也不错，全哨的共同课目和专业课目测验总评成绩“良好”。他们取得这样的成绩真不容易。几年中，他们除去日夜执行繁重的观察放哨任务外，还要自己买米买面，轮流做饭。学习时间是从休息时间内硬挤出来的。我插嘴问：“天阴下雨时，你们该休息一下吧？”他们好像觉得我是个外行，争着说：“那怎么能行呢？我们要是自己休息，把敌人飞机放过去，让它轰炸后方的目标，这是对人民不负责任啊！”
    2月26日，慰问团的一部分代表和演员，从第四连慰问回来，怀着骄傲的心情对留在家里的人说：“你们没有去，太遗憾了！我们今天才看到战士们的艰苦生活。”什么事情给了代表和演员这样深刻的印象呢？情况是这样的：第四连全连官兵好几年驻在海边，他们爬山过水巡逻放哨，同敌人派来的特务、“水鬼”进行斗争。战士们每天平均要走五、六十里路。去年年底，四班长陈顺仙到北京参加了公安军积极分子代表会议，回来的时候，部队已接受了构筑国防工事的任务。战友们知道陈顺仙见到了毛主席，看到陈顺仙带回来的锦旗、照片等纪念品，都觉得光荣，纷纷订计划、表决心，要努力提前完成构筑工事任务，做好工作，争取再派代表到北京去见毛主席。慰问团的代表休息了三、四次才爬上第四连驻扎的山顶，官兵们热情地欢迎他们。他们看到官兵们住的是透风的草房和下雨就漏的帐篷，又和正在劳动的战士们见了面，战士们个个光着膀子，头上的汗水不住地往下流，满身是泥。第一分团团长常子祚，拉住战士的手看过以后问：“疼不疼？”战士们笑着回答：“开头时磨起的血泡有点疼，现在已经磨出一层硬皮，不觉得疼了。”
    在去年的几次大台风期间，前线岛上的部队经受了一次严重的考验，很多营房被风摧垮，东西被风刮走，但是部队官兵丝毫没有放松战斗准备。有一个哨兵，被风刮得从山上滚到山坳，他爬起来以后继续执行勤务；一个观察哨的屋顶被风刮走，当时正下大雨，战士们就在床板底下坚持工作。
    3月5日，记者到距敌人盘踞的东引、西引和马祖列岛很近的一个岛上，访问了一个前哨班。他们已经自己动手盖起一间草房。我到的这天，正是大风大雨，房子漏了，雨水不断滴到床上。吃饭时饭很凉，我问他们的时候，班长林德成说，几年来，他们一直是到后面山上去打饭，那座山高三百多公尺，坡有七、八十度，打一次饭上下得一个半小时，遇到刮风下雨，难上难下，所以打来的饭路上都凉了。去年刮台风的那几天，老百姓知道他们不能上去打饭，送给他们一些地瓜米。他谈了以后，我问：“那你们喜欢在岛上生活吗？”去年入伍的战士、青年团员张才兴立刻回答说：“我们到部队来为的是保卫祖国，住在哪儿都行，越艰苦，我们越觉得光荣。”
