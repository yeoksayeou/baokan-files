Asanuma Inejirō said at a press conference:
The Japanese Socialist Party will launch a movement to restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China

　　In answering questions from reporters, Asanuma Inejirō said, "We hope to discuss Asian issues and the world situation with Chinese leaders in addition to discussing Sino-Japanese relations."

　　He also said that the main task of the Japanese Socialist Party at present is to launch a movement among the people to restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China.

　　When talking about the Taiwan issue, this Japanese Socialist leader said that Taiwan is a part of China and is China's internal affair. "We believe that this internal affair can be resolved by China itself."

　　Asanuma Inejirō believes that the development prospects of Sino-Japanese trade are very promising. He said, "Sino-Japanese trade should not only be based on economic interests, but should also take into account the construction work that is helpful to the two countries and the entire Asia, as well as the cause of world peace."

　　In response to the United Kingdom's plan to test nuclear weapons on Christmas Island, Asanuma Inejirō said, "We advocate banning the use and testing of all atomic and hydrogen weapons, because atomic war will mean the destruction of mankind."

　　He said that a national movement has been launched in Japan to oppose the British hydrogen bomb test, and Japan has also sent a special envoy to the United Kingdom regarding this matter. Asanuma Inejirō said, "We want to oppose atomic bomb warfare from a humanitarian standpoint. We believe that we will definitely win, because no one can oppose our position."

　　Asanuma Inejirō reminded reporters that the current conservative party in Japan has taken a step forward in its views on issues such as Sino-Japanese relations, opposition to hydrogen bomb tests, Sino-Japanese trade, and cultural exchanges. The issue of exchanging resident commercial representatives between the two countries should be put on the agenda.

　　On cultural exchanges, he suggested that the governments of the two countries conclude a cultural agreement.

    浅沼稻次郎在记者招待会上说
    日本社会党人将掀起恢复日中邦交运动
    在回答记者提出的问题时，浅沼稻次郎说，“我们希望和中国领导人员除了讨论中日关系外，还希望讨论亚洲问题和世界局势问题。”
    他还说，日本社会党人目前的主要任务是在人民中间掀起一个恢复日中邦交的运动。
    这位日本社会党领袖在谈到台湾问题时说，台湾是中国的一部分，是中国的内政问题。“我们相信这个内政问题是能够由中国自己来解决的”。
    浅沼稻次郎认为，中日贸易的发展前途是很有希望的。他说，“日中贸易应该不仅建立在经济利益的基础上，而且应该考虑到有助于两国和整个亚洲的建设工作以及世界和平事业。”
    在回答英国准备在圣诞岛试验核武器的意见时，浅沼稻次郎说，“我们主张禁止一切原子和氢武器的使用和试验，因为原子战争将意味着人类的毁灭。”
    他说，在日本已经掀起了一个国民运动来反对英国的氢弹试验，日本并且已经就这件事派了一个特使到英国去。浅沼稻次郎说，“我们要从人道主义的立场来反对原子弹战争。我们相信，我们一定会获得胜利，因为没有人能反对我们这种立场。”
    浅沼稻次郎提醒记者说，目前日本的保守党在对于诸如中日关系，反对氢弹试验，中日贸易和文化交流等问题的看法上已经向前进了一步。两国交换常驻商务代表的问题应该提到日程上来了。
    在文化交流上，他建议两国政府之间缔结文化协定。
