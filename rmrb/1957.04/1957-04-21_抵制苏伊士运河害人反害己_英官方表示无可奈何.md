　　Xinhua News Agency report: The Cairo "Republic" published an editorial on the passage of British ships through the Suez Canal on the 19th, saying that this fact shows that the British government has failed to achieve its attempt to force British ships to boycott the canal as a political pressure on Egypt. British shipping companies rightly see the canal as a commercial waterway rather than a political waterway. "They have actually implemented the principle of isolating the Suez Canal from politics, which proves that they are much wiser and more realistic than their government."

　　After the Egyptian Suez Canal Authority announced on the 18th temporary measures for all countries' ships to pay passage fees, a British government spokesman said on the 19th that although the government had repeatedly advised British shipowners to avoid using the Suez Canal, it was "difficult" to make the shipowners comply with the government's advice.

　　Recently, the British shipping industry and public opinion have increasingly expressed dissatisfaction with the policy of "boycotting" the Suez Canal. The London "Daily Mail," which has always demanded a tough policy towards Egypt, commented on April 18th: "The cold fact is that there is only one Suez Canal, and Egypt 'controls it,' and ships from many countries are already passing through the canal and benefiting from lower fares." The commentary pointed out, "If Britain is not prepared to continue hurting others and itself, it must also recognize this. An agreement is bound to be reached one day, so why not do it now?"

　　The latest issue of "New Statesman and Nation" also mocked Britain's attempt to force Egypt to make concessions by boycotting the Suez Canal. It wrote: "Britain can certainly continue to insist on its unilateral boycott. However, in order to reduce the addition of one pound to the Egyptian treasury, British canal users lose ten pounds. The situation in the past nine months should convince those fanatical conservatives that economic pressure cannot defeat Nasser. If we are determined to carry out this struggle, then it is very likely that the main victim of this struggle will be the British economy."

　　The Western countries' policy of boycotting the Suez Canal is on the verge of bankruptcy. A U.S. State Department spokesman said on the 18th that the U.S. government is notifying U.S. shipowners preparing to use the Suez Canal that they can pay the passage fee to Egypt while filing a protest.

　　However, the French authorities are still taking a stubborn attitude. A Foreign Ministry spokesman said on the 19th that the French government has stricter control over its shipping than the British government and the U.S. government over theirs. French shipowners are still being "strongly advised" not to use the Suez Canal until the canal dispute is fully resolved through international negotiations. It is reported that the French government will use financial pressure such as subsidies and foreign exchange to force French shipowners to comply with the "advice."

### 抵制苏伊士运河害人反害己  英官方表示无可奈何

    抵制苏伊士运河害人反害己
    英官方表示无可奈何
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：开罗“共和国报”就英国船只19日通过苏伊士运河一事发表社论说，这一事实表明，英国政府未能实现它强迫英国船只抵制这条运河作为对埃及施行政治压力的企图。英国航运公司很正确地把这条运河看成是一条商业水道而不是政治水道，“它们实际上实施了使苏伊士运河与政治绝缘的原则，这就证明它们比它们的政府明智得多、现实得多。”
    在埃及苏伊士运河管理局18日宣布各国船只交付通行费的临时办法后，英国政府的一个发言人在19日表示，虽然政府一再劝告英国船主避免使用苏伊士运河，要使船主们遵从政府的劝告“是困难的”。
    最近以来，英国航运界和舆论对“抵制”苏伊士运河的政策日益表示不满。一向要求对埃及采取强硬政策的伦敦“每日邮报”在4月18日发表评论说：“冷酷的事实是，只有一条苏伊士运河，而掌握它的”则是埃及，“许多国家的船只已经在通过运河，并且从较低的运费中获得好处了”。评论指出，“英国假如不准备继续害人反害己的话，也必须承认这一点。总有一天不免要达成协议，为什么现在不这样做呢？”
    最近一期“新政治家与民族”周刊，也嘲笑英国想用抵制苏伊士运河的办法来迫使埃及让步的企图。它写道：“英国当然可以继续坚持它的一意孤行的抵制。可是，为了少给埃及国库中增加一镑钱，却使英国运河使用者损失十镑钱。过去的九个月的情况应当使那些狂热的保守党人相信，用经济压力是打不倒纳赛尔的，如果我们坚决要进行这种斗争，那么很可能，这个斗争中的主要牺牲者将是英国的经济。”
    西方国家抵制苏伊士运河政策已经濒于破产。美国国务院的一个发言人在18日说，美国政府正在通知准备使用苏伊士运河的美国船主，他们可以一面提出抗议，一面把通行费付给埃及。
    但是，法国当局还在抱着死硬的态度，外交部发言人在19日说，法国政府对它的船运比英国政府和美国政府对它们的船运控制得要严些，法国船主仍然在受到“强有力的劝告”不要使用苏伊士运河，直到运河争端通过国际谈判获得完全解决时为止。有消息说，法国政府将使用补助金和外汇等财政压力迫使法国船主遵从“劝告”。
