    Qinghai-Tibet Railway to be Surveyed Soon

    (Our newspaper reports) Preparations are underway for the surveying of the railway line from Quanji, Qinghai, to Lhasa, Tibet. In addition to crossing the Gobi Desert, this line must also traverse the Tanggula Mountains, the roof of the world, where the air is thin and the climate is harsh. Oxygen and cold-proof masks and other supplies must be provided for the work. The engineering team responsible for surveying this line is actively preparing and selecting young and strong surveying and mapping personnel to undertake this arduous task.

    This line will play a significant role in developing the underground resources of Qinghai and Tibet, developing agriculture and animal husbandry, consolidating national defense, strengthening border construction, and improving the lives of ethnic minority areas.

    青海到西藏铁路即将踏勘
    本报讯　青海全吉至西藏拉萨的铁道线路正在准备踏勘。这条线路除经过戈壁沙滩外，还要穿越世界屋脊唐古拉山，空气稀薄，气候恶劣，进行工作时必须配备氧气和防寒面具等用品。负责踏勘这条线路的工程队正在积极准备，并挑选年青力壮的勘测人员来担当这一艰巨的任务。
    这条线路对开发青海、西藏的地下宝藏和发展农牧业、巩固国防、加强边疆建设、改善少数民族地区的生活等方面都将起很大的作用。
