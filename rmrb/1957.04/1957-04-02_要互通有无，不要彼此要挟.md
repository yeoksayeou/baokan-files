    Promote Mutual Exchange, Not Coercion

    In the current situation of material scarcity, "mutual exchange" is a good way to solve material shortages. However, there are still many obstacles to mutual exchange. Many people have serious departmentalism in handling materials. They hold on to materials that are not needed or urgently needed for their own production and projects, and are unwilling to let other units use them, even those units that urgently need them and whose production is about to be affected. They even often use the control of these scarce goods as capital to coerce the other party for benefits. For example, when the Fushun Open-pit Mine asked the local Mechanical Third Factory to make a batch of fishplates, the Mechanical Third Factory insisted that the Open-pit Mine provide coke in exchange. Because the Open-pit Mine could not provide coke, this deal almost fell through. When the Fushun Acid-Resistant Pottery Factory undertook to produce a batch of insulating bricks for the Fushun Coal Construction Company, this factory insisted that the Coal Construction Company provide electrical wires in exchange. The Coal Construction Company neither produced nor traded electrical wires, so how could they exchange them? Later, this order had to be "blown" because the conditions could not be met. Some units also emphasize equal quality and equal price during mutual exchange, and no one is willing to compromise, mistakenly believing that "we are friends only if we both have what the other has," and when I have what you don't have, they impose strict blockades.

    To reverse this situation and remove artificial obstacles in material exchange, everyone should think more about the overall situation when handling materials.

    要互通有无，不要彼此要挟
    在当前材料缺乏的情况下，以“互通有无”来解决材料的不足本来是个好办法。但是当前在互通有无方面还有很多障碍，有不少人在处理材料的时候存在严重的本位主义思想，手里抓到一点材料，本来是他生产和工程上不需要或不迫切需要的，也不愿意让给急需的、甚至是眼看就要影响生产的单位使用。他们甚至常常是以掌握这类缺货作为资本，向对方进行要挟“拿把”。如抚顺露天矿在当地机械三厂作一批鱼尾板，机械三厂就一定要露天矿拿焦炭来换，因为露天矿拿不出焦炭来，这笔买卖险些落空。抚顺耐酸陶器厂给抚顺煤建公司承制一批绝缘砖，这个厂就非要煤建公司拿电线交换不可，煤建公司一不生产电线，二不经营电线，怎么能够换得成呢？后来这笔订货就只好在达不到条件的情况下“吹”了。也有些单位在互通有无的时候，强调等质等价，谁也不肯让一步，错误地认为“你有我有方成友”，而当我有你无的时候就严加封锁。
    要扭转这种局面，解除材料交换中人为的障碍，就要大家在处理材料的时候，多从整体想一想。
