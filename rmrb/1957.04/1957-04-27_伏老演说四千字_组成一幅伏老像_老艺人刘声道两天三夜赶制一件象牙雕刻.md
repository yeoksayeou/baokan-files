Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 26th. Chongqing gold and stone carving artist Liu Shengdao handed over a portrait of Chairman Voroshilov that he recently carved to relevant departments, ready to be sent to Chairman Voroshilov.

It was only after looking at the portrait carved by Liu Shengdao with a magnifying glass that it was discovered that the portrait was composed of the more than 4,000-word speech made by Chairman Voroshilov at the enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress in our country on the 16th of this month.

This portrait is carved on a piece of ivory that is 2.4 inches long and 1.6 inches wide in the city scale. Liu Shengdao said that in order to clearly see Chairman Voroshilov's speech on the portrait with the naked eye, the words in the lower part of the portrait need to be magnified fifteen times, and the words in the upper part need to be magnified forty-five times.

This exquisite work of art was created by Liu Shengdao in two days and three nights. On the second day of Chairman Voroshilov's arrival in our country—on the evening of the 16th of this month—he began the portrait, and it was finally completed on the 20th. During these days, Liu Shengdao worked meticulously, working until four or five o'clock in the morning every day before resting.

Liu Shengdao told reporters that when he saw the news in the newspaper that Chairman Voroshilov was visiting our country, he thought about how a Chinese ivory carving artist should express his respect and welcome to the Soviet guest. Therefore, he decided to give this gift to Chairman Voroshilov with his own labor.

Liu Shengdao is a famous gold and stone carving artist in Chongqing. On May 1st, Chongqing will hold the "Liu Shengdao and Other Five People's Literary and Artistic Gold, Stone and Ivory Carving Exhibition."

    伏老演说四千字　组成一幅伏老像
    老艺人刘声道两天三夜赶制一件象牙雕刻
    新华社重庆26日电　重庆市金石雕刻艺人刘声道，把他最近刻好的一幅伏罗希洛夫主席的肖像交给了有关部门，准备转寄给伏罗希洛夫主席。
    刘声道刻的这幅肖像，经放大镜一照，才知道肖像是以伏罗希洛夫主席本月16日在我国全国人民代表大会常务委员会扩大会议上作的长达四千多字的演说词组成的。
    这幅肖像是刻在市尺二寸四分长、一寸六分宽的一块象牙上。刘声道说，要用肉眼看清楚肖像上的伏罗希洛夫主席的演说词，肖像下面部分的字要放大十五倍，上面部分的字要放大四十五倍。
    这件精致的艺术品，是刘声道花了两天三夜的功夫创作出来的。在伏罗希洛夫主席到达我国的第二天——本月16日晚上，他就开始画像，到20日才最后完成。在这几天里，刘声道精雕细琢，每天都工作到深夜四、五点钟才休息。
    刘声道告诉记者，当他从报上看到伏罗希洛夫主席来我国访问的消息后，就想到作为一个中国牙刻艺人应该怎样表示对苏联贵宾的尊敬和欢迎。因此，他决定用自己的劳动给伏罗希洛夫主席赠送这件礼品。
    刘声道是重庆市一个著名的金石雕刻艺人。在5月1日，重庆市将举办“刘声道等五人文艺金石牙刻展览会”。
