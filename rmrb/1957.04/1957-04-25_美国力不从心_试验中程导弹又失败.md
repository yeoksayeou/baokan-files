Xinhua News Agency, Washington, April 24th: It is said that the United States Air Force's recent test launch of a "Thor" ballistic missile with a range of 1,500 miles has failed again.

It is said that the results were not much better than the launch test in January of this year, when the rocket only rose a few feet before burning and falling to the ground.

    美国力不从心
    试验中程导弹又失败
    新华社24日讯　华盛顿消息：据说，美国空军最近进行的另一次发射一千五百英里射程的“雷神”式弹道导弹的试验又告失败。
    据说结果并不比今年1月的发射试验好多少，当时火箭只升高数英尺，然后就燃烧着落下地来。
