Who Went Bankrupt?
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Jiang Yuanchun
　　Recently, the "New York Times" sent a reporter to Egypt. After arriving in Egypt, this reporter requested an interview with President Nasser. Although President Nasser was very busy, he still took the time to meet with him for three consecutive days, holding lengthy talks with him. Shortly thereafter, the articles about Egypt written by this reporter were published serially in the "New York Times." But strangely, not a single word of what President Nasser had told him was reported.
　　There could, of course, be various speculations as to why the "New York Times" was unwilling to let its readers know what President Nasser had said. However, the "New York Times" itself provided a clue. It nonchalantly sent an open telegram to its reporter in Egypt, asking him to use his "imagination" to report on the "bankruptcy" of the Egyptian economy.
　　If the Egyptian economy had indeed reached the point of "bankruptcy," then the "New York Times" reporter could simply use his eyes to observe and write an article; what need was there for "imagination"? As a reporter, my conclusion based on observation rather than "imagination" in Egypt is that the Egyptian economy is not bankrupt, although it does have difficulties. And these difficulties were caused by the aggression of Britain, France, and Israel, the freezing of Egyptian pound and dollar deposits in those two countries by Britain and the United States, and the economic blockade of Egypt by imperialists. Imperialists, including the United States, have tried every possible means to bankrupt the Egyptian economy in order to take advantage of this situation to infringe upon Egypt's sovereignty and independence.
　　However, Egypt has friends all over the world. Relying on Egypt's own efforts and the help of friends, its difficulties can certainly be overcome and are being overcome. This situation is very displeasing to American colonialists. One of the purposes of the United States in clamoring about a "communist threat" in the Middle East is to undermine the economic cooperation of equality and mutual benefit between peaceful and neutral countries like Egypt and Syria and socialist countries, in order to realize its conspiracy to bankrupt the Egyptian economy. But this move has not succeeded either, which has forced the "New York Times" to resort to its reporter's "imagination"—to put it bluntly, his "fabrication skills"—to concoct the ghost story of Egypt's economic "bankruptcy."
　　It can be seen that the "New York Times"'s standard for publishing articles is not whether they conform to the truth, but whether they conform to the intentions and interests of American colonialism. In this light, it is only natural that its reporter wasted much of President Nasser's time without reporting a single word. Of course, it is probably no problem for this American reporter to use his "imagination" to write an article reporting on Egypt's economic "bankruptcy." However, Egypt's economy will not "go bankrupt" because of this curse from the "New York Times." What has truly gone bankrupt is the "New York Times" itself and its bosses behind the scenes.

    谁破产了？
    蒋元椿
    最近，“纽约时报”派了一个记者到埃及去。这位记者到了埃及以后，要求访问纳赛尔总统。纳赛尔总统虽然很忙，可是仍然抽出时间来，一连三天接见了他，同他作了长时间的谈话。不久以后，这位记者所写的关于埃及的文章在“纽约时报”上连续登载了。可是奇怪得很，纳赛尔总统对他说过的话，他却一个字也没有报道。
    “纽约时报”为什么不愿意让它的读者知道纳赛尔总统说了些什么，这事情当然可以作各种各样的猜测。不过，“纽约时报”自己提供了一个线索。它满不在乎地打了一个公开的电报给它的在埃及的记者说，请他运用他的“想像力”，报道埃及经济“破产”的情形。
    如果埃及的经济的确到了“破产”的程度，那末“纽约时报”的记者只要用他的眼睛观察，就可以写出一篇文章，要“想像力”干什么？作为一个记者，我在埃及根据观察而不是“想像”所得出的结论是：埃及的经济并没有破产，虽然它的确有困难。而这种困难是英、法、以色列的侵略、英国和美国冻结埃及在这两国的英镑和美元存款、帝国主义者们对埃及的经济封锁所造成的。包括美国在内的帝国主义者们想尽办法要使埃及经济破产，以便利用这种情势来侵犯埃及的主权和独立。
    然而埃及在全世界都有着朋友。依靠埃及自己的努力和朋友们的帮助，它的困难一定可以克服而且正在克服。这种情况使得美国殖民主义者很不称心。美国之所以要在中东叫嚷什么“共产主义威胁”，其目的之一就是想破坏埃及、叙利亚这些和平中立的国家同社会主义国家之间的经济上平等互利的合作，来实现它的使埃及经济破产的阴谋。可是这一着也没有成功，这就使得“纽约时报”只好乞灵于它的记者的“想像力”——说得坦白一些，就是“造谣本领”——来编造埃及经济“破产”的鬼话了。
    可见，“纽约时报”刊载稿件的标准并不是它是否符合于事实的真相，而是它是否符合美国殖民主义的意图和利益。照这样看来，它的记者浪费了纳赛尔总统的许多时间而一个字也没有报道出来，就是很自然的事情了。当然，这位美国记者发挥“想像力”，写出一篇报道埃及经济“破产”的文章，大概不成问题。可是，埃及的经济是不会因为“纽约时报”的这种咀咒而就此“破产”的。真正破产了的倒是“纽约时报”自己和它的后台老板们。
