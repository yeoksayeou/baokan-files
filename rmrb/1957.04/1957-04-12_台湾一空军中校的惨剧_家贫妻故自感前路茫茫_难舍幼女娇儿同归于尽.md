Xinhua News Agency, 11th. According to Taiwanese and Hong Kong newspapers, in Taiwan, where suicide, murder, assassination, rape-murder, and love-murder are rampant, a tragic incident recently occurred involving a Chiang Kai-shek army Air Force officer who killed his entire family and then committed suicide. Li Chao-kui, a lieutenant colonel in the Chiang Kai-shek army Air Force, poisoned his nine-year-old son and six-year-old daughter at his residence in Taipei on the evening of March 28th. He also strangled his three-year-old daughter to death before committing suicide. The next day, neighbors discovered that Li Chao-kui and two of his children were already dead, with only his nine-year-old son surviving after being poisoned.

Taiwanese newspapers reported that Li Chao-kui lived a very difficult life after arriving in Taiwan. Recently, his wife died in poverty and illness, causing him even greater mental distress, leading to the tragic event of killing his entire young family and then committing suicide.
