Welcome Guest
Liu Qian

From northern China, bringing a coldness that has not yet dissipated, you have arrived, bringing warmth to the hearts of the people of Beijing like springtime. Although Moscow and Beijing are far apart, the people of our two great nations, China and the Soviet Union, have long been connected heart to heart. We welcome you, not just Beijing, but six hundred million people. We know how to greet a good neighbor with sincere friendship. We are representing our motherland to warmly welcome you, welcome, Comrade Voroshilov, esteemed guest.

You first cleaved the path of October with sabers; you first plowed the fields of socialism with horseshoes. Why do the Chinese people respect you so much today? Because you have made immortal contributions for the entire proletariat.

Today, vehicles follow vehicles, crowds follow crowds, Beijing's boiling songs echo into the clouds. Tiananmen, you see our motherland's joyful heart, the streets and alleys are filled with countless happy people. Why are the girls dressed so beautifully to welcome you? Why are the children smiling, and the elderly feeling younger? Because of your sincere and selfless assistance to our country, we deeply thank you, thank you for representing the Soviet Union. Why are colorful arches erected everywhere you pass? Why are the roads filled with flags like brocade, colorful under the sunlight? To express our unity, mutual assistance, and sincere friendship, the people of our two great nations, China and the Soviet Union, will always love and be close to each other.

    欢迎嘉宾
    柳倩北中国带着还未散尽的寒冷，你来了，北京人心上温暖如春。莫斯科与北京虽说相隔很远，中苏两大国人民早已心连着心。欢迎你不仅北京而是六亿人民，我们懂得怎样用真诚的友爱接待芳邻。我们正代表祖国热情地迎接你，欢迎啊，伏罗希洛夫同志，尊贵的嘉宾。你们最初用军刀劈开十月的道路；你们最初用马蹄替社会主义耕耘。中国人民今天为什么要对你这样尊敬？因为你替整个无产阶级立下不朽功勋。今天车辆接着车辆，人群接上人群，北京沸腾的歌声一直响彻入云。天安门你看到是我们祖国欢跃的心，满街满巷拥塞的是数不清的快乐的人民。为什么姑娘们打扮得这么漂亮来欢迎你？为什么孩子们脸上堆着笑，老年人更觉年轻？因为你们对我国赤诚无私的援助，我们深深地感激你，感谢你代表的苏联。为什么你走过的地方到处都高搭彩楼？为什么马路上红旗似锦，阳光下五色缤纷？为了表示我们团结、互助，和真挚的友谊，中苏两大国的人民永远是相爱相亲。
