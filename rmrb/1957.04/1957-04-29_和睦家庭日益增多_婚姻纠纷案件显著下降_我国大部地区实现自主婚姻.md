Xinhua News Agency, April 28th: Currently, most areas of the country have universally achieved autonomous marriage. This is a significant change in China's social marriage situation in the seven years since the promulgation of the Marriage Law (this law was promulgated on May 1, 1950).

According to a 1956 survey by the Supreme People's Court, in most areas of Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Shanxi, Hubei, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and other provinces, autonomous marriages account for 90% to 100%. The Ministry of Internal Affairs once inspected 2.65 million marriage registrations and found that 95% of them complied with the provisions of the Marriage Law. With the basic completion of the socialist transformation and the realization of autonomous marriage, the original view that marriage relationships were determined by land, housing, and property has gradually changed to a marriage view that loves labor and loves progress.

Due to the autonomy of marriage and the improvement of the people's ideological awareness, family relationships have also generally improved. According to a survey by the All-China Women's Federation, 85% to 95% of families are currently harmonious. Especially after the high tide of socialist transformation and the "Five Good" activities in cities, family relationships have undergone profound changes, and new types of families with equality between men and women, democracy and harmony, unity in production, and respect for the old and love for the young have increased significantly. These profound changes have led to a significant decline in family and marriage dispute cases. According to statistics from the Supreme People's Court, from 1953 to 1956, marriage dispute cases have been declining year by year, and marriage cases in 1956 decreased by more than half compared to 1953.

However, there are still some noteworthy issues in the handling of marriage and family problems in some places. For example, some young men and women still hold marriage views based on money and status, and some young people have a frivolous attitude towards relationships due to a lack of caution in choosing partners and the idea of being fond of the new and tired of the old. In addition, in some remote rural areas, the old custom of demanding betrothal gifts still exists; in some places, feudal arranged and forced marriages, as well as early marriages, are still quite numerous. All these situations have directly or indirectly harmful effects on the country's construction and the happiness of future generations.

### 和睦家庭日益增多　婚姻纠纷案件显著下降  我国大部地区实现自主婚姻

    和睦家庭日益增多　婚姻纠纷案件显著下降
    我国大部地区实现自主婚姻
    据新华社28日讯　目前全国大部地区已经普遍实现自主婚姻，这是婚姻法颁布七年来（这个法律是1950年5月1日颁布的）中国社会婚姻状况的重大改变。
    根据最高人民法院1956年的调查，在黑龙江、辽宁、山西、湖北、江西、浙江等省大部分地区自主婚姻已占90％到100％。内务部曾经检查了二百六十五万对结婚登记的情况，知道其中95％是符合婚姻法规定的。随着社会主义改造事业的基本完成和自主婚姻的实现，原来婚姻关系决定于土地、房屋、财产的观点逐渐转变为爱劳动、爱进步的婚姻观点。
    由于婚姻的自主和人民群众思想觉悟的提高，家庭关系也普遍有了改善。根据全国妇联的调查，目前85％到95％的家庭是和睦的，特别是在社会主义改造高潮和城市开展“五好”活动以后，家庭关系起了深刻的变化，男女平等、民主和睦、团结生产、尊老爱幼的新型家庭显著增多。这些深刻的变化引起了家庭和婚姻纠纷案件显著的下降。据最高人民法院统计，从1953年到1956年婚姻纠纷案件逐年都在下降，1956年的婚姻案件比1953年减少了一半以上。
    但是，目前有些地方在婚姻和家庭问题的处理上，还存在一些值得十分注意的问题。例如目前一部分男女青年还存在着从金钱、地位出发的婚姻观点，有些青年由于选择对象时不够慎重和喜新厌旧的思想，结果产生了对两性关系的轻率态度。另外，在一部分偏僻的农村中至今还存在着索取财礼的旧习俗；有的地方封建包办买卖婚姻以及早婚的现象还为数不少。这种种情况，都对国家建设事业和后代子孙的幸福产生了直接间接的有害作用。
