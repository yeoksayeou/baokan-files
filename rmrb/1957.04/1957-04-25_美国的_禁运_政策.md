    America's "Embargo" Policy

    After this newspaper published the news on the 22nd that the U.S. State Department was forced to agree to some relaxation of the "embargo" against China, some readers raised some questions about this matter. The replies are as follows:

    Q: How did the United States impose the "embargo" policy on many countries?

    A: In order to carry out the "Cold War" and attempt to economically blockade socialist countries, the United States began to implement the "embargo" policy shortly after the end of World War II. In 1948, the United States strengthened export controls on goods of a "military nature" to Eastern European People's Democracies. In 1949, the United States Congress passed the "Export Control Act." In the same year, the United States coerced other Western countries to establish the "Paris Coordinating Committee" in Paris. The committee established an "Adjustment Committee" responsible for controlling the trade of Western countries with the Soviet Union and European People's Democracies. After the United States launched the Korean War, it manipulated the United Nations General Assembly in 1951 to pass an illegal resolution to impose an "embargo" on China and North Korea. In 1952, it added a so-called "China Committee" to the "Coordinating Committee," responsible for controlling trade with China. The countries that formally participated in this "embargo" organization include: the United States, the United Kingdom, France, West Germany, Italy, Japan, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Norway, Turkey, Canada, Denmark, Portugal, Greece, and other fifteen countries. Through the "embargo" policy, the United States has continuously weakened and attacked the foreign trade of its partners, making them more economically dependent on the United States.

    In order to force these countries to obediently succumb to the United States' selfish "embargo" policy, the United States Congress successively passed the "Kem Amendment" and the "Battle Act" in 1951, stipulating that any Western country that violates the "embargo" regulations will be subject to U.S. sanctions of suspending "aid."

    Q: To what extent will the "embargo" against China be relaxed?

    A: According to the recommendations made by the United States to fourteen countries, the scope of relaxation of the "embargo" is limited to "certain items for peaceful use prohibited from being shipped to China" to bring it closer to the "basis" of the "strategic materials" embargo against the Soviet Union. According to foreign news agencies, of the commodities prohibited from being exported to socialist countries by the "Paris Coordinating Committee," 450 types were embargoed against China, and 170 types were embargoed against the Soviet Union. Now, the United States is also preparing to transfer some commodities that were originally only embargoed against China to the list of embargoes against the Soviet Union. From this, it can be seen that although the United States has to relax the embargo against China, it still stubbornly refuses to abandon this bankrupt policy.

    Q: What is the "exception procedure" in the "embargo"?

    A: The "exception procedure" is a provision of the "Paris Coordinating Committee." According to this provision, any country participating in the "Coordinating Committee" may, when it believes it is in line with its vital national interests, allow the export of some "embargoed" materials. The British government notified the "China Committee" of the "Coordinating Committee" in May 1956 to invoke the "exception procedure" of the "embargo" against China to expand trade with China. Japan also stated in September of the same year that Japan would actively use the "exception procedure."

### 美国的“禁运”政策

    美国的“禁运”政策
    本报22日登载了美国国务院被迫同意把对中国的“禁运”作某些放宽的消息后，有些读者对这件事提出了一些问题，现简复如下：
    问：美国怎样把“禁运”政策强加在许多国家身上？
    答：美国为了进行“冷战”，企图在经济上封锁社会主义国家，在第二次大战结束后不久就开始实行“禁运”政策。1948年，美国对东欧人民民主国家加强了“军用性质”商品的出口管制，1949年，美国国会又通过了“出口管制法”。同年，美国更挟持其他西方国家在巴黎成立了“巴黎统筹委员会”，在委员会里设立“调整委员会”，负责管制西方国家对苏联和欧洲人民民主国家的贸易。美国发动侵朝战争后，于1951年操纵联合国大会通过了对中、朝两国实行“禁运”的非法决议，并于1952年在“统筹委员会”中增设了一个所谓“中国委员会”，负责管制对中国的贸易。正式参加这个“禁运”组织的国家有：美国、英国、法国、西德、意大利、日本、比利时、荷兰、卢森堡、挪威、土耳其、加拿大、丹麦、葡萄牙、希腊等十五个国家。美国通过“禁运”政策，不断削弱和打击它的伙伴们的对外贸易，使它们在经济上更加依赖于美国。
    为了强使这些国家驯顺地屈从美国这个损人利己的“禁运”政策，美国国会在1951年先后通过了“肯姆修正法案”和“巴特尔法”，规定凡违反“禁运”条例的西方国家，都将受到美国停止“援助”的制裁。
    问：对中国的“禁运”将放宽到什么程度？
    答：根据美国向十四个国家提出的建议，放宽“禁运”的范围，限于“禁止运往中国的某些和平用途的项目”使之接近于对苏联实行
  “战略物资”禁运的“基础”上。据外国通讯社透露，在“巴黎统筹委员会”订出的禁止向社会主义国家出口的商品中，对中国禁运的达四百五十种，对苏联禁运的则有一百七十种。现在，美国并准备把一些原来只对中国禁运的商品转入到对苏禁运的清单中去。从这里可以看出，美国虽然不得不放宽对中国的禁运，但它仍然顽固地不肯放弃这个破产了的政策。
    问：什么是“禁运”中的“例外程序”？
    答：“例外程序”是“巴黎统筹委员会”所规定的一条，根据这条规定，参加“统筹委员会”的任何国家，可以在它认为合乎它的极关重要的国家利益的时候，允许输出一些“禁运”的物资。英国政府就曾在1956年5月通知“统筹委员会”的“中国委员会”援用对中国“禁运”的“例外程序”扩大对华贸易。日本也在同年9月表示日本要主动地利用“例外程序”。
