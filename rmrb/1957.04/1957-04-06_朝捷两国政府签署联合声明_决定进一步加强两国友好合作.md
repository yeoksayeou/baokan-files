Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 5th. The Premier of the Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Kim Il-sung, and the Premier of the Czechoslovak Republic, Viliam Široký, signed a joint statement of the two governments in Pyongyang yesterday. The statement said that the two governments had reached complete agreement on the issues of further developing friendly and economic and cultural cooperative relations between Korea and Czechoslovakia, further strengthening friendly cooperation and unity between socialist countries, and all important international issues.

The statement said that both sides unanimously believe: "It is necessary to be vigilant against the sabotage plots of the imperialist aggressive blocs against socialist countries, and to further consolidate the close cooperation and unity among socialist countries." "The close unity and friendly cooperation of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China are a reliable guarantee for defending the socialist cause and consolidating world peace." "Socialist countries assist each other in all aspects of socialist construction. At the same time, the fundamental principles of socialist construction are common in these countries. However, at present, it is undeniable that each socialist country should consider its own historical, socio-economic, national characteristics and traditions in the form and methods of socialist construction, and this is the premise."

The two governments declared that they would be loyal to the principle of proletarian internationalism and resolutely oppose all tendencies attempting to revise Marxism-Leninism.

The two governments emphasized that Korea should realize peaceful reunification on a democratic basis by the Korean people themselves as soon as possible. And believe that: "The Korean armistice should be transformed into a consolidated peace, and all foreign troops stationed in Korea, including the Chinese People's Volunteers, should be withdrawn immediately and simultaneously. An international conference of relevant countries should be convened as soon as possible to peacefully adjust other Korean issues."

The two governments pointed out that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, in which the Czechoslovak Republic is represented, plays a positive role in supervising the observance of the Korean Armistice Agreement, and emphasized that both sides of the armistice should strictly abide by the Korean Armistice Agreement. Any act that hinders the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission from performing its duties and attempts to dissolve it should be condemned.

The two sides agreed to continue to develop friendly and cooperative relations between Korea and Czechoslovakia in all aspects. The two governments are prepared to sign a long-term trade agreement in the first half of 1957. Both sides have reached an agreement on how to more effectively utilize the economic and technical assistance provided by Czechoslovakia to Korea.

The two governments reached a consensus on a number of important international issues. In the statement, the two governments condemned the United States' aggressive policy in the Near and Middle East. The two governments expressed their full support for the Soviet government's position in its proposal to the governments of the United States, Britain, and France on February 11 this year regarding the Near and Middle East.

The two governments reiterated their solidarity with the Hungarian people's struggle, under the leadership of the Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government, to heal the wounds suffered by the counter-revolutionary riots and to consolidate the socialist system. The two governments believe that "in order to ensure peace in Europe, it is necessary to establish a European collective security system including the existing two German states, which will create conditions for the unification of Germany on a democratic basis." The two governments support the Soviet disarmament proposal put forward on March 18.

The two governments advocate the realization of the proposal by China and India on the conclusion of a collective security treaty among Asian and Pacific countries.

The two governments believe that the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations should be restored quickly, and Taiwan, an inseparable territory of the People's Republic of China, should belong to China.

The statement said, "National reunification of Vietnam should be realized peacefully on a democratic basis. The obstacles created by the South Vietnamese authorities in the process of implementing the Geneva Accords with the support of the United States should be removed."

The statement concluded, "The two governments are convinced that the visit of the Czechoslovak government delegation to Korea and the exchange of views between the two governments will be beneficial to the further development of friendly cooperation between the two countries and beneficial to the consolidation of world peace and international security."

    朝捷两国政府签署联合声明
    决定进一步加强两国友好合作
    新华社平壤5日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁首相金日成同捷克斯洛伐克共和国总理西罗基昨天在平壤签署了两国政府联合声明。声明说，两国政府对于进一步发展朝捷两国友好和经济文化合作关系的问题、进一步加强社会主义国家间友好合作和团结的问题以及一切重要的国际问题取得了完全一致的意见。
    声明说，双方一致认为：“对帝国主义侵略集团反对社会主义阵营国家的破坏阴谋，有必要提高警惕，要进一步巩固社会主义阵营各国间的紧密的合作和团结。”“以苏联和中华人民共和国为首的社会主义国家的紧密团结和友好合作是保卫社会主义事业和巩固全世界和平的可靠的保证。”“社会主义国家在社会主义建设的各方面是相互进行协助的。同时在这些国家中社会主义建设的根本原则是共同的。但是，在目前不否认每个社会主义国家在社会主义建设的形式和方法上要考虑自己的历史的、社会经济的和民族的特性和传统，而且是以这些为前提的。”
    两国政府声明，要忠实于无产阶级国际主义的原则，坚决反对一切企图修正马克思列宁主义的偏向。
    两国政府强调，朝鲜应该由朝鲜人民自己在民主的基础上迅速实现和平统一。并且认为：“朝鲜的停战应该转为巩固的和平，驻在朝鲜的一切外国军队，包括中国人民志愿军在内应该立即同时撤退。应该尽速召开有关国家的国际会议，以便和平调整其它朝鲜问题。”
    两国政府指出，有捷克斯洛伐克共和国代表参加的中立国监察委员会在监督朝鲜停战协定的遵守中起着积极的作用的事实，并且强调停战双方应当严格遵守朝鲜停战协定。任何阻挠中立国监察委员会执行任务和企图解散它的行为都应受到斥责。
    双方协议要从各方面继续发展朝、捷两国间的友好合作关系。两国政府准备在1957年上半年签订一个长期贸易协定。双方对如何更有效地利用捷克斯洛伐克提供给朝鲜的经济、技术援助取得了协议。
    两国政府对于一些重要的国际问题取得了一致意见。在声明中两国政府斥责了美国在中近东地区实行的侵略政策。两国政府表示完全支持苏联政府今年2月11日向美、英、法三国政府提出的关于中近东的建议的立场。
    两国政府对于匈牙利人民在工农革命政府的领导下进行的医治因反革命暴乱而遭受的创伤和巩固社会主义制度的斗争，再次表示声援。两国政府认为，“为了保障欧洲的和平，必须建立包括现存的两个德意志国家在内的欧洲集体安全体系，这将为在民主的基础上统一德国造成条件。”两国政府支持苏联3月18日提出的裁军方案。
    两国政府主张实现中国和印度两国关于签订亚洲和太平洋各国集体安全条约的建议。
    两国政府认为，中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利应该迅速得到恢复，中华人民共和国不可分割的领土——台湾应该归属中国。
    声明说，“应该在民主的基础上用和平的方法实现越南的民族统一。在美国的支持下南越当局在履行日内瓦协定的过程中所造成的障碍应该予以清除。”
    声明最后说，“两国政府确信：捷克斯洛伐克政府代表团的访问朝鲜和两国政府间的交换意见，将有益于两国友好合作关系的进一步发展，有益于巩固世界和平和国际安全。”
