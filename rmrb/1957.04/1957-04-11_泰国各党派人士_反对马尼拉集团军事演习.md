Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch from Bangkok: Under the initiative of the Socialist United Front of Thailand, representatives and members of parliament from eight political parties, along with over thirty non-partisan politicians, held a joint meeting on the 4th. They issued a declaration opposing the series of military exercises scheduled by the Manila Treaty Organization to take place in the South China Sea and the Gulf of Siam from April 24th to early June.

The meeting decided to hold large-scale mass rallies, post various anti-war slogans when the Manila Treaty Organization begins its military exercises; and to propose bills in parliament opposing the military exercises.

The meeting also issued appeals to the governments of Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and other countries, requesting them to cease nuclear weapons testing.
