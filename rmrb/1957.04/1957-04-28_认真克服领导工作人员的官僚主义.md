Conscientiously Overcome Bureaucracy Among Leading Staff
Huang Huoqing, First Secretary of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

In order to correctly handle contradictions among the people, especially to correctly resolve contradictions between the people and leaders, it is first necessary to seriously and conscientiously overcome the bureaucratic work style among leading staff. Judging from the recent ideological examination of cadres in Tianjin, we feel that this is very important and indeed effective.

Some Cadres Have Developed Bureaucratic Work Styles; They Do Not Understand That Contradictions Will Arise Among the People

In the past few years, the vast majority of Tianjin's staff members have maintained the glorious revolutionary tradition, maintained and promoted the work style of hard struggle and close ties with the masses, worked diligently, greatly improved their ideological awareness, and achieved significant results in their work. However, after the high tide of socialist transformation last year, a few cadres believed that the system of exploitation had been basically eliminated, and that the period of great changes in production relations had come to a victorious end, so they could relax. They do not understand or do not fully understand the arduousness of socialist construction; they do not understand or do not fully understand that after the basic end of large-scale class struggle between the enemy and ourselves, contradictions will still arise among the people, and it is still necessary to pay attention to adjusting various issues within the socialist society at any time. Therefore, among some cadres, work has become lax, arrogance and complacency have grown, they are aloof and bureaucratic tendencies have grown. Obviously, this is not conducive to promoting socialist construction or to correctly resolving contradictions among the people.

In accordance with the spirit of the "Eighth National Congress" and the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, and based on the ideological situation of cadres in Tianjin, we conducted a work and ideological examination focusing on overcoming bureaucracy among more than 3,000 cadres above the section chief level throughout the city, based on studying the documents of the "Eighth National Congress." The examination began in early January this year and ended at the end of February. The method adopted was to combine ideological examination with work examination, and in accordance with our Party's formula for resolving internal contradictions—unity—criticism—unity—proceeding from the desire for unity, enlightening self-awareness, promoting democracy, adopting a "gentle breeze and fine rain" approach, leading personnel set an example, deeply carrying out self-criticism and criticism, to achieve the purpose of improving understanding, strengthening unity, improving leadership, and improving work.

During this examination, the leading cadres of most units had a relatively high level of self-awareness, were able to fully promote democracy, widely enlighten and listen to bottom-up criticism, and actively conduct self-examination. In units that did this, the examination proceeded relatively smoothly and quickly, problems were exposed more thoroughly, examinations were also more profound, and the effects on improving leadership and improving work were more significant, as was the educational effect on ordinary cadres and the masses, strengthening the unity between leaders and those led. However, the leading cadres of a few units did not have a high level of self-awareness in the early stages of the examination, their attitude was not correct enough, or they were arrogant and complacent, or afraid of losing face and taking responsibility, and had a resistant attitude towards the examination, did not actively solicit opinions from below, did not actively and conscientiously conduct self-examination, and even refused criticism; as a result, the examination could not be carried out smoothly. For such units, we personally sought out their leading cadres for individual talks, to improve their ideological self-awareness, correct their attitude, dispel their concerns, promote and help them to fully promote democracy. At the same time, we guided the masses to expose problems and offer opinions; and gave the comrades being criticized a full opportunity to speak, in order to deepen criticism and self-criticism through discussion and analysis, and to truly clarify thinking and improve understanding. In this way, those comrades who originally had a resistant attitude changed their attitude and gradually recognized their shortcomings and mistakes.

The examination showed that among a small number of cadres, the phenomena of individualism and political decline are very noteworthy. The prominent manifestations are competing for fame, competing for position, competing for treatment, and not competing for work. Some people regard themselves as heroes, and regard fame and position as their due rewards. Someone said: "In the past, it was right to 'endure hardship first and enjoy later'; now the situation is different, and it cannot be mentioned like this anymore." Some people even haggled with the Party and the state. For example, one cadre from an intellectual background said: "The wages of workers and peasants are too high. We have prepaid capital (referring to having received education), and wages should be higher." Another cadre did not work hard because he was not promoted, saying this was "payment according to labor." In addition, some people are greedy for comfort, slack in work, and lack a sense of responsibility. They believe that "it's better not to pursue work issues deeply, the more you pursue, the more trouble there will be"; "factories are dirty, roads are long, winters are cold, and summers are hot," it is better to sit in the office "which is easier and more comfortable"; they either push things to the leadership or to the lower levels, and just muddle through. Some people are ideologically decadent, listless, and going downhill; others think more about food and clothing, think less about work, live extravagantly and wastefully, and are passive and sluggish in their work. Facts have proved that wherever individualistic thinking develops more seriously, wherever there are cadres with a tendency to decline in revolutionary will, there will inevitably be phenomena of irresponsibility in work and detachment from the masses in life, and they will not be able to share weal and woe with the masses, and bureaucracy will inevitably arise.

Two Manifestations of Bureaucracy: Leadership is Not Thorough, Work Style is Not Democratic

The examination showed that bureaucracy is a fairly common phenomenon, but the degree varies. Its main manifestations are two:

(1) Leadership is not thorough and is generalized; action is slow and work is procrastinated. In recent years, many cadres have developed the idea of ​​"taking a breath" and being satisfied with the status quo. Some people think: "The revolution has been victorious, it's not as tense as during the war, and if something is delayed, the sky won't fall"; others think: "The work order is regularized, the lower levels already have experience, and there are no major problems in the work." Therefore, they rarely take action themselves and study hard; they are satisfied with listening to general reports, holding meetings for general arrangements, and approving documents in the office, and rarely go deep down. Even if they occasionally go down, they are just "seeing the flowers on horseback" and cannot conduct in-depth investigations and research to seriously solve problems. Compatible with this situation are large institutions, multiple levels, and complicated work procedures.

(2) The work style is not democratic, there is no respect for the collective leadership of the Party committee, the leadership methods are simple and rigid, administrative orders are used purely, and the mass line is not followed. They believe that "the masses can discuss it for a long time, it is better than an administrative order," "persuasion and education are too troublesome, and criticism and punishment are more effective." Some cadres have developed a sense of arrogance and complacency, emphasizing personal roles and calculating personal gains and losses. They ignore the opinions and requirements of cadres and the masses, do not pay attention to helping them with their work, criticize them at every turn, and lightly punish them, which affects the enthusiasm and initiative of the lower-level cadres and alienates the leaders from those being led.

After this examination, the ideology of the vast number of cadres, especially the leading cadres of various units, has been greatly improved. It is generally recognized that if ideological remolding is not strengthened, and if individualism and bureaucratic work styles are allowed to develop, it will not only endanger personal development, but will also deepen the contradiction between leaders and the people, which will have a major impact on the revolutionary cause. Therefore, the ideology and work style of hard struggle, diligent work, thrift and simplicity, and close ties with the masses have been promoted among cadres; the unity among cadres has also been enhanced. In particular, it sounded the alarm for cadres with political decline, most of whom have begun to wake up, realizing that "if one allows one's own wrong thoughts to develop, there is a danger of deviating from the revolution," and expressed their determination to correct their mistakes.

With the improvement of thinking, there have been some new atmospheres in leadership and work in various units. In terms of streamlining institutions, municipal-level agencies have been actively implementing the central government's instructions on streamlining staffing in a realistic manner. For example, the various departments of the Municipal Party Committee decided to reduce the number of staff by 263 (including 75 section and division-level cadres), accounting for 26.8% of the total number of cadres. The reduction of staff in various units of the Municipal People's Committee system is also about one-third (for example, the Civil Affairs Bureau reduced its staff by 33%, and the Tax Bureau reduced its staff by 41.5%). The cadres streamlined from the leading agencies are being transferred to district-level agencies and grassroots units. Some reasonable adjustments have also been made to meetings. The municipal-level agencies have determined "no meeting days." On this day, leading agencies throughout the city do not hold meetings so that leading cadres can go deep into the lower levels to carry out work. After this examination, most leading cadres have paid much more attention than before to going deep into the grassroots, understanding the situation, studying problems, and strengthening specific leadership, and their work has become more thorough than before.

Transformation of Leadership Style Promoted the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement

The transformation of leadership has encouraged the enthusiasm of the vast number of cadres and the masses, and has effectively promoted the work. This is prominently reflected in the Increase Production and Practice Economy Movement. For example, the Refractory Materials Factory (mainly producing crucibles) had irregular production in the past due to frequent shortages of raw materials. After this examination, the factory director personally went to the raw material production area (Shanxi) to understand the raw material production situation and assisted local organizations in organizing some agricultural production cooperatives to develop the sideline production of crucible soil. As a result, not only was the factory's raw material problem solved, and the output in January and February exceeded the quota by 50%, but also the income of the cooperative members in the raw material production area increased.

Although this examination has yielded many gains, it also has some shortcomings. The main ones are that some cadres are not highly self-aware and cannot face their own shortcomings, and the higher-level leading agencies lack specific assistance; some units also have some situations where they are tight in the front and loose in the back, and the examination is not deep or thorough enough. Even the problems that have been solved still require a lot of effort to consolidate the results.

From this examination, we also deeply realized that there are many defects in our political and ideological work in the past. The main reason why the above-mentioned ideological problems have not been resolved earlier is that our political and ideological leadership over cadres is not strong. Especially after the socialist upsurge last year, we were not able to help the vast number of cadres understand the great significance of the tremendous and profound changes that have taken place in time, so that everyone's thinking can adapt to the new situation; we did not vigorously carry out the education of hard work and simple living, and building the country through diligence and thrift among cadres, so that everyone can understand the arduousness of socialist construction. Political and ideological work in some aspects has been relaxed instead; at the same time, there is a lack of regular education and supervision of cadres.

This time, the focus was on examining and criticizing ideologies such as bureaucracy and individualism, and the erroneous ideologies such as subjectivism and sectarianism that currently exist among cadres have not been focused on. At present, many cadres still have more or less vague understandings of issues such as the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy, the superiority of agricultural cooperation, the united front policy, and the policy toward the bourgeoisie. Failure to eliminate these erroneous ideas will hinder the mobilization of all positive factors to serve socialist construction.

Therefore, this examination is only the beginning of strengthening the political and ideological work of cadres, and much work remains to be done in the future. Recently, we convened a city-wide propaganda work conference, bringing together non-Party intellectuals and Party propaganda work cadres from science, education, literature, art, health, news and publishing to discuss Chairman Mao's report at the Eleventh Enlarged Meeting of the Supreme State Conference and the spirit of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's Propaganda Work Conference; at the same time, we widely disseminated Chairman Mao's report at the Supreme State Conference within and outside the Party, requiring everyone to study it in depth, combine it with their own thinking, and conduct in-depth discussions in connection with reality, to further overcome subjectivism, bureaucracy, and sectarianism; on the basis of improving thinking, we must also combine it with the work of various units to specifically analyze various contradictions among the people and study the many new problems raised in the new situation.

Secondly, we are organizing Party members throughout the city to study the Party Constitution, adhere to the principle of combining theory with practice, deeply carry out criticism and self-criticism, strengthen Party spirit training, promote the Party's fine traditions of hard struggle and close ties with the masses, and prepare for the rectification movement that will begin soon.

In order to continue to overcome bureaucracy and effectively adjust the problems existing in the internal relations of socialist society, it is necessary to further take measures to promote democracy. In addition to correctly implementing the system of the People's Congress, the system of the Political Consultative Conference, implementing the policy of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision, and improving the collective leadership system of Party committees at all levels and strengthening the supervision of Party member cadres by Party organizations, it is also necessary to widely mobilize the strength of the masses and implement bottom-up supervision. Democratic management should be further strengthened in factories. A system of regularly soliciting opinions from the masses should be established in schools and hospitals to increase the contact between leading cadres and the masses, and more consultations should be held with non-Party members in case of trouble. We believe that as long as there is normal democratic life, and leading cadres can go deep into the masses and share weal and woe with the masses, then the contradictions between the people and the leaders will surely be discovered in time and resolved in time.

    认真克服领导工作人员的官僚主义
    中共天津市委第一书记　黄火青
    为了正确地处理人民内部的矛盾，特别是正确地解决人民群众和领导者之间的矛盾，必须首先严肃地认真地克服领导工作人员中的官僚主义作风。这一点，从天津市最近进行的一次干部思想检查的情况来看，我们感觉十分重要，也是确有实效的。
    部分干部滋长了官僚主义作风  不了解人民内部会产生矛盾
    几年来，天津市绝大部分的工作人员，保持着光荣的革命传统，保持和发扬了艰苦奋斗、密切联系群众的工作作风，辛勤努力，思想觉悟有了很大的提高，工作上也有显著的成绩。但是，在去年社会主义改造高潮之后，也有少数干部认为剥削制度已经基本消灭，生产关系大变革时期已经胜利结束，就可以松一口气了。他们不了解或不完全了解社会主义建设的艰巨性；不了解或不完全了解在敌我之间的大规模的阶级斗争基本结束之后，在人民内部，仍然会产生矛盾，还需要随时注意调整社会主义社会内部关系中的各种问题。因而在一部分干部中，工作松懈，骄傲自满，高高在上，官僚主义作风有所滋长。很显然，这是不利于推进社会主义建设，不利于正确地解决人民内部矛盾问题的。
    根据“八大”和八届二中全会的精神和天津市的干部思想情况，在学习“八大”文件的基础上，我们在全市三千多科长以上的干部中，进行了一次以克服官僚主义为主要内容的工作和思想检查。检查从今年1月初开始，到2月底结束。所采取的方法是检查思想和检查工作相结合，按照我党解决内部矛盾的团结——批评——团结的公式，从团结的愿望出发，启发自觉，发扬民主，“和风细雨”，领导人员以身作则，深入开展自我批评和批评，达到提高认识，增强团结，改进领导，改进工作的目的。
    在这次检查中，多数单位的领导干部都有比较高的自觉性，能够充分发扬民主，广泛地启发和倾听自下而上的批评，主动地进行自我检查。这样作的单位，检查进行得都比较顺利和迅速，问题揭发得比较彻底，检查得也比较深刻，在改进领导改进工作上效果较为显著，对一般干部和群众的教育作用也比较大，增强了领导和被领导的团结。但是也有少数单位的领导干部，在检查初期自觉性不高，态度不够端正，或者是骄傲自满，或者怕丢面子、怕负责任，对检查有抵触情绪，不积极征求下面的意见，不主动、认真地进行自我检查，甚至拒绝批评；这样，检查就不能顺利开展。对这样的单位，我们就亲自找它的领导干部个别谈话，提高他们的思想自觉，端正他们的态度，解除他们的顾虑，推动并帮助他们充分发扬民主。同时引导群众揭发问题，提意见；并给被批评的同志以充分发言的机会，以共同讨论、分析的方式，使批评自我批评深入下去，切实搞通思想，提高认识。这样就使那些原来有抵触情绪的同志，改变了态度，逐步认识了自己的缺点和错误。
    从检查中看出，在少数干部中，个人主义思想和政治衰退的现象是十分值得注意的。其突出的表现是争名誉，争地位，争待遇，不争工作。有些人以功臣自居，把名誉、地位看成是自己应得的报酬。有人说：“过去‘吃苦在先、享受在后’是应该的；现在情况不同了，不能再这么提了。”甚至有人向党和国家讨价钱。例如有一个知识分子出身的干部说：“工农干部工资太高了，我们有预付资本（指受过教育），工资应该高些。”另一个干部因为没有提级，不好好工作，说这是“按酬付劳”。此外，有些人贪图安逸，工作松懈，缺乏责任心。他们认为“对工作问题索性不要深追，越追，麻烦事越多”；“工厂脏，马路长，冬天冷，夏天热”，不如坐办公室“又省事，又舒服”；遇事不是推给领导，就是推给下级，得过且过。有的人思想颓废，暮气沉沉，走退坡路；还有的人吃穿想的多，工作想的少，生活铺张浪费，工作消极、疲沓。事实证明，凡是个人主义思想发展得比较严重的地方，凡是有革命意志衰退倾向的干部，就必然产生工作上不负责任，生活上脱离群众，不能与群众同甘共苦的现象，就必然产生官僚主义。
    官僚主义的两种表现形式  领导不深入作风不民主
    从检查中可以看出，官僚主义是相当普遍的现象，只是程度有所不同。其主要表现形式有二：
    （一）领导不深入，一般化；行动迟缓，办事拖拉。不少干部几年来滋长了“松一口气”和满足于现状的思想。有的认为：“革命胜利了，不像战争时期那末紧张了，有事拖一下也塌不了天”；也有的认为：“工作秩序正规了，下面已经有经验，工作中没什么大不了的问题”。因此，遇事很少亲自动手，刻苦钻研；满足于听听一般的汇报，开会作一般的布置，坐在办公室里批批文件，很少深入下去。偶尔下去也是“走马观花”，不能深入进行调查研究，认真解决问题。同这种情况相适应的是机构大、层次多、工作手续繁杂。
    （二）作风不民主，不尊重党委集体领导，领导方法简单生硬，单纯使用行政命令，不走群众路线。他们认为：群众讨论半天，不如行政一道命令”，“说服教育太麻烦，还是批评、处分效力大”，有些干部骄傲自满的情绪滋长，强调个人作用，计较个人的得失。对干部和群众的意见要求，不加理睬，对他们的工作，不注意帮助，动辄批评，轻率处分，影响了下面干部的积极性和主动性，使领导者与被领导者疏远起来。
    经过这次检查，广大干部、特别是各单位领导干部的思想有了很大提高，普遍地认识到如果不加强思想改造，使个人主义思想和官僚主义作风发展起来，不但个人的发展是危险的，而且将加深领导与人民群众的矛盾，对革命事业将有重大危害。因而艰苦奋斗、勤恳工作、勤俭朴素、密切联系群众的思想和作风在干部中有所发扬；干部之间的团结也有所增进。特别是向政治衰退的干部敲响了警钟，其中大多数人已开始醒悟过来，认识到“如果一任自己的错误思想发展下去，就有脱离革命的危险”，表示了改正错误的决心。
    随着思想的提高，各单位在领导上、工作上都有了一些新气象。市级各机关在精简机构方面，实事求是地积极贯彻了中央关于精简编制的指示。如市委各部决定减编二百六十三人（其中科、处长级干部七十五人），占干部总数的26.8％。市人民委员会系统各单位减编也在三分之一左右（其中，如民政局减编33％，税务局减编41.5％）。领导机关精简下来的干部，正在调往区级机关和基层单位。对于会议也作了一些合理的调整，市级机关确定了“无会议日”，在这一天，全市领导机关不举行会议，以便领导干部深入下层进行工作。经过这次检查，大多数领导干部在深入基层、了解情况、研究问题、加强具体领导等方面，较前大大注意了，工作较前深入了。
    转变领导作风  推进了增产节约运动
    领导上的转变，鼓舞了广大干部和群众的积极性，有力地推动了工作。这突出地表现在增产节约运动上。如耐火器材厂（主要生产坩埚），过去因为原料供应经常不足，生产不正常。这次检查后，厂长亲自到原料产地（山西）了解原料生产的情况，协助当地组织了一些农业生产合作社开展坩子土的副业生产。结果不仅解决了该厂的原料问题，1、2月份产量超额50％，而且使原料产地的合作社员增加了收入。
    这次检查虽然有许多收获，但是也有一些缺点，主要是有些干部自觉性不高，不能正视自己的缺点，上级领导机关也缺乏具体的帮助；有些单位还有些前紧后松的情况，检查得不深不透。就是已经解决的问题，为了巩固成果，也还需要作很多努力。
    从这次检查中，我们也深深觉察到过去我们的政治思想工作存在着许多缺陷。上述种种思想问题之所以未能更早地得到解决，最主要的原因，是我们对干部的政治思想领导不强。特别是去年社会主义高潮以后，我们没有能够及时帮助广大干部了解已经发生的巨大深刻的转变的重大意义，使大家的思想能够适应新的形势；我们没有及时在干部中大力进行艰苦朴素、勤俭建国的教育，使大家了解社会主义建设的艰巨性。有些方面的政治思想工作反而放松了；同时，对干部也缺乏经常的教育和监督。
    这次主要是检查和批判了官僚主义、个人主义等思想，至于目前干部中存在的主观主义、宗派主义等错误思想，还没有着重检查。目前不少干部对“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，对农业合作化的优越性，对统一战线政策和对资产阶级的政策等问题都还存在着或多或少的模糊认识。不清除这些错误思想，就会妨害调动一切积极因素为社会主义建设服务。
    因此，这次检查只是加强干部的政治思想工作的开始，今后还需要进行很多工作。最近我们召开了全市宣传工作会议，吸收了科学、教育、文艺、卫生、新闻出版各方面的非党知识分子和党的宣传工作干部在一起，讨论了毛主席在最高国务会议第十一次扩大会议上的报告和中共中央宣传工作会议的精神；同时在党内党外广泛传达毛主席在最高国务会议上的报告，要求大家深入学习，联系思想、联系实际展开深入的讨论，进一步克服主观主义、官僚主义和宗派主义；在思想提高的基础上，还要结合各单位的工作，具体分析各种人民内部的矛盾，研究新形势下提出的许多新问题。
    其次，我们正在组织全市党员学习党章，坚持理论联系实际的原则，深入开展批评自我批评，加强党性锻炼，发扬党的艰苦奋斗、密切联系群众的优良传统，并为不久即开始的整风运动作好准备。
    为了继续克服官僚主义，有效地调整社会主义社会内部关系中存在的问题，还必须进一步采取措施，发扬民主。除了正确贯彻执行人民代表大会的制度、政治协商会议的制度，贯彻执行长期共存、互相监督的方针，以及健全各级党委的集体领导制度，加强党组织对党员干部的监督外，还要广泛动员群众的力量，实行自下而上的监督。在工厂中应进一步加强民主管理工作。在学校、医院中应建立定期征求群众意见的制度，增加领导干部与群众的接触，遇事多和党外人士协商。我们相信：只要有正常的民主生活，领导干部又能深入群众，与群众同甘共苦，那么，人民群众和领导者之间的矛盾，就一定能够及时发现，并及时得到解决。
