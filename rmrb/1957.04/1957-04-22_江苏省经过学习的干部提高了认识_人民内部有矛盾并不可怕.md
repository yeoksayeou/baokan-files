Jiangsu Province Cadres Increase Awareness Through Study: Internal Contradictions Among the People Are Not to Be Feared
The Provincial Party Committee believes that resolving internal contradictions among the people must implement the "three freedoms" spirit of "ideological liberation, democratic openness, and decentralization of financial power." Currently, many comrades within the Party are still afraid to "let go," and some outside the Party have confused ideas, such as believing that "contention" is a "lure the enemy in deep and then annihilate them" strategy, which needs to be further clarified.

Nanjing, April 21st (this newspaper) – The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and party organizations at all levels are actively implementing the spirit of Chairman Mao's speeches at the Supreme State Conference and the National Propaganda Work Conference by studying and improving their work simultaneously.

Chairman Mao's instructions have been widely conveyed and studied by hundreds of thousands of cadres and non-Party members in Jiangsu Province. In mid-April, Provincial Party Committee Secretaries Jiang Weiqing, Liu Shunyuan, Hui Yuyu, Xu Jiatun, and others held separate discussions with responsible comrades from various departments and commissions, heads of democratic parties, senior intellectuals, representatives from various classes of the intermediate party school, and party and non-party staff in the news and publishing sectors. Some city and county party committees organized concentrated study sessions for district committee secretaries and cadres above the section chief level. The Provincial People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and various municipal CPPCCs also conveyed the information to all their members.

During the study and discussion process, cadres generally felt that their ideological level had improved, their working methods had increased, and non-Party members had enhanced their confidence in the principles of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" and "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision." The study and discussion also clarified some cadres' confused ideas. Initially, some were afraid of the concept of internal contradictions among the people, considering it an ominous sign, and dared not face and admit it. Later, in exploring the root causes and manifestations of internal contradictions among the people, a more consistent view was reached: it was believed that internal contradictions among the people not only exist now but also existed during the domestic revolutionary war, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the War of Liberation. However, in the current period of socialist construction, the domestic class struggle has basically ended, and internal contradictions among the people have risen to the position of the main contradiction. Everyone then analyzed the different nature and different methods of handling the two types of contradictions, thereby affirming that the existence of internal contradictions among the people is not to be feared and does not need to be concealed. As long as they are handled correctly, the contradictions will be resolved.

The Provincial Party Committee is taking a series of effective measures to mobilize Party members and non-Party members to resolve internal contradictions among the people.

The provincial organizational work conference held in mid-March believed that further implementation of measures such as streamlining organizations, transferring cadres to lower levels, and stabilizing and improving cadres are effective methods for improving leadership and resolving contradictions.

After the basic completion of socialist transformation, many new problems have emerged in urban and rural economic work, and the Party Committee can no longer be satisfied with simply grasping industrial and agricultural production. In order to strengthen the overall leadership of urban and rural economic work, the Third Plenary Committee (Enlarged) of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, convened in early April, focused on discussing this issue. The meeting, based on the principles of "overall planning, appropriate arrangements, and strengthening ideological education," conducted specific research and analysis of the pressing problems existing in the economic life of the people throughout the province—vigorously developing sideline production, handicraft industry serving agricultural production, prices, burdens, the arrangement of surplus labor, and households with difficulties, and strengthening unified leadership—and found some ways and means to solve the problems.

On April 15th, the Provincial Party Committee convened a meeting of responsible comrades from various departments and commissions, at which the study situation of each unit was reviewed. In their speeches at the meeting, Provincial Party Committee Secretaries Jiang Weiqing and Liu Shunyuan emphasized the need to take various measures to conscientiously carry out this study and propaganda, first requiring the responsible comrades of each department and commission to personally lead this study well. At the same time, the Provincial Party Committee is preparing to send dozens of responsible cadres to certain cities and counties to assist various units in their studies; and by assisting in the establishment of various mass scientific societies, opening up contention gardens, and organizing people from intellectual and academic circles to "let a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," to create conditions for intellectuals to express their opinions freely.

The Provincial Party Committee believes that solving the problem of internal contradictions among the people in the province must implement the "three freedoms" spirit of "ideological liberation, democratic openness, and decentralization of financial power." Currently, many comrades within the Party are still afraid to "let go," and some outside the Party have confused ideas, such as believing that contention is a "lure the enemy in deep and then annihilate them" strategy. The Third Plenary Session of the First Provincial CPPCC, convened on April 20, and the propaganda and cultural work conference, attended by non-Party members, which the Provincial Party Committee is about to convene, will focus on studying and solving these problems.

### 江苏省经过学习的干部提高了认识  人民内部有矛盾并不可怕

    江苏省经过学习的干部提高了认识
    人民内部有矛盾并不可怕
    省委认为：解决人民内部矛盾必须贯彻“思想解放，民主开放，财权下放”的“三放”精神。目前党内还有不少同志怕“放”，党外也有认为“争鸣”是“诱敌深入、聚而歼之”等混乱思想，需要进一步加以澄清。
    本报南京21日电　中共江苏省委和各级党组织，采取边学习、边改进工作的办法，积极贯彻毛主席在最高国务会议和在全国宣传工作会议上讲话的精神。
    毛主席的指示，在江苏省成千上万的干部和党外人士中，已进行了普遍的传达和学习。省委书记江渭清、刘顺元、惠浴宇、许家屯等同志在4月中旬，先后分别同各部、委的负责同志、民主党派的负责人、高级知识分子、中级党校各班代表、新闻出版界的党内外工作人员进行了座谈。有些市、县党委组织了区委书记、科长以上干部进行集中学习。省政协和各市政协也分别向所有成员进行了传达。
    在学习和讨论过程中，干部普遍感到思想水平提高了，工作办法增多了，党外人士增强了对“百家争鸣、百花齐放”，“长期共存、互相监督”的信心。在学习讨论中，也澄清了一些干部的糊涂思想。起初有人对人民内部有矛盾的提法是害怕，认为它是不祥之物，不敢正视和承认，后来在探讨人民内部矛盾的产生根源和表现形式时，取得了比较一致的看法：认为人民内部矛盾不仅现在存在，在国内战争时期、抗日战争时期和解放战争时期也存在，不过在现在社会主义建设时期，国内阶级斗争已基本上结束，人民内部矛盾已上升到主要矛盾的地位。大家又分析了两种矛盾的不同性质和不同的处理方法，因而肯定人民内部存在矛盾并不可怕，并不需要隐讳，只要正确处理，矛盾是会解决的。
    省委对动员党内外力量解决人民内部矛盾问题，正在采取一系列的有效措施。
    3月中旬召开的全省组织工作会议认为：进一步贯彻整编机构、干部下放和稳定提高干部等措施，是改进领导、解决矛盾的有效方法。
    社会主义改造基本完成之后，城乡经济工作中出现了许多新问题，党委已不可能以抓工农业生产为满足。为了加强城乡经济工作的全面领导，中共江苏省委4月上旬召开的第三次全体委员会议（扩大）上，着重讨论了这一个问题。会议根据“统筹兼顾、适当安排、加强思想教育”的方针，对全省人民经济生活中存在的迫切问题——大力发展副业生产，手工业为农业生产服务，物价、负担、多余劳力和困难户的安排，加强统一领导等，作了具体的研究和分析，并找到了一些解决问题的方法和途径。
    4月15日，省委召开了各部、委负责同志会议，会上检查了各单位的学习情况。省委书记江渭清、刘顺元等同志在会上的发言，都强调要采取各项措施，认真搞好这次学习和宣传，首先要求各部、委负责同志亲自领导好这次学习；同时，省委准备派出数十名负责干部到某些市、县，帮助各单位学习；并通过协助成立各种群众性的科学学会，开辟争鸣园地，组织知识界学术界人士“百花齐放、百家争鸣”，为知识界广开言路创造条件。
    省委认为：解决全省人民内部矛盾问题，必须贯彻“思想解放、民主开放、财权下放”等“三放”的精神。目前党内尚有不少同志怕“放”，党外也有争鸣是“诱敌深入，聚而歼之”等类的混乱思想。4月20日省政协召开的一届三次全体会议和省委即将召开的有党外人士参加的宣传、文教工作会议，将着重研究解决这些问题。
