Xinhua News Agency dispatch: According to reports from Xinhua News Agency: The British House of Commons concluded a two-day debate on defense policy on the 17th. The government's defense policy was passed by a vote of 308 to 250, and the Labor Party's motion of censure was rejected by a vote of 309 to 258.

Since the UK's new defense policy was put forward, its aspect of reducing conventional armaments has caused apprehension within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, while its aspect of relying on nuclear weapons has aroused fierce opposition in the UK itself. The debate took place under these circumstances.

Defense Minister Sandys spoke first on the 16th, defending the government's defense policy. He explained that the new "defense" policy was made based on the following two understandings: first, under the current circumstances, it is impossible to effectively defend the United Kingdom from hydrogen bomb attacks; and second, the United Kingdom "can no longer continue to devote such a large part of its resources, especially manpower, to defense." He also emphasized: "One of the principles of our defense policy is: Britain must manufacture hydrogen bombs."

Labor Party defense spokesman Brown put forward the Labor Party's motion of censure on the government's defense policy on the 16th. This proposal accused the government's defense policy of "over-reliance on ultimate deterrence," and demanded that the government put forward effective proposals to strive for the prohibition of hydrogen bomb testing through international agreements, and postpone the United Kingdom's hydrogen bomb testing.

During the two-day debate, many members of parliament criticized the government's defense policy of relying on atomic nuclear deterrence.

Macmillan, in response to the attacks from members of parliament, tried his best to defend the government's policy of focusing on the development of atomic nuclear weapons. He said that Britain must rely on the "deterrent power" of nuclear weapons to "prevent world war." Before an international agreement is reached on the issue of complete disarmament, "we must rely on atomic nuclear deterrence, otherwise we will have to admit defeat." He also said that if Britain is to reduce its army and stop conscription, it must accept nuclear weapons.

He attacked Labor Party members of parliament for demanding a postponement of hydrogen bomb testing. He said that he also does not approve of postponing the test, because, "if the test is postponed, it can never be held again."

    乞灵于原子核威慑力量
    英国下院通过新国防政策
    本报综合报道　据新华社消息：英国下院在17日结束了两天来关于国防政策的辩论。政府的国防政策以三百零八票对二百五十票通过，工党的谴责案以三百零九票对二百五十八票被否决。
    自从英国新国防政策提出来以后，它要削减常规军备的一面在北大西洋集团中引起了疑惧，而它要依靠核武器的一面又在英国本国引起了激烈的反对。这次辩论就是在这样的情况下进行的。
    国防大臣桑迪斯在16日首先发言，为政府的国防政策辩护。他解释说，新的“防御”政策是根据以下两点认识而作出的：第一，在目前情况下，有效地保卫英国不受到氢弹的攻击是不可能的；第二，英国“不能再继续把那样大的一部分资源，特别是人力，用于防御方面”。他并强调说：“我们国防政策的原则之一就是：英国必须制造氢弹。”
    工党国防问题的发言人布朗16日提出了工党对政府国防政策的谴责案。这个提案指责政府的国防政策“过分依赖最后的威慑力量”，要求政府提出有效的建议争取通过国际协议来禁止氢弹试验，并且把英国的氢弹试验推迟。
    在两天的辩论中，许多议员指责政府依赖原子核威慑力量的国防政策。
    麦克米伦针对议员们的攻击，竭力为政府着重发展原子核武器的政策辩护。他说，英国必须仰赖核武器的“威慑力量”来“阻止世界大战”，在全面裁军的问题达成国际协议之前，“必须依靠原子核威慑力量，否则就得认输”。他还说，如果英国要裁减军队和停止征兵，就必须接受核武器。
    他攻击工党议员要求推迟试验氢弹。他说，他也不赞成推迟试验，因为，“如果试验被推迟，那就永远不能再举行了”。
