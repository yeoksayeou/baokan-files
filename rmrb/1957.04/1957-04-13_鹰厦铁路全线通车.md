    Yingtan-Xiamen Railway Opens to Traffic

    (Our Xiamen Dispatch, April 12th) At 12:00 noon today, the first direct passenger train to Yingtan, Jiangxi, departed from Xiamen Station, the terminus of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway. From this point forward, the entire 690+ kilometer Yingtan-Xiamen Railway is open to traffic, more tightly linking Xiamen, at the forefront of coastal defense, with the interior of the motherland.

    This morning, after a light rain, Xiamen Station was bedecked with colorful flags and brimming with joy. At 11:20, people from all walks of life in Xiamen and representatives of the garrison troops arrived at the station square in high spirits. Then, a ceremony was held to celebrate the opening of the railway. Li Wenling, the Mayor of Xiamen, representatives of the garrison troops, and representatives of the New Line Temporary Business Management Office of the Railway Corps delivered speeches successively. Mayor Li Wenling said that the construction of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway and its full opening to traffic today should first of all be attributed to the military engineers and civilian workers who built the road day and night. At 11:50, amidst cheers and applause, Young Pioneers presented flowers to the train conductor, the driver, and the train attendants. At 12:00 noon sharp, the whistle sounded, and the train slowly departed from Xiamen Station to the sound of military music. At this time, the passengers in the carriages frequently waved goodbye to the cheering crowd.

    This direct passenger train had fifteen carriages, including soft-sleeper cars, hard-sleeper cars, a children's car, and simple passenger cars. Among the passengers were returned overseas Chinese, laborers going to develop the economy of the mountainous areas of Fujian, students from the Jimei Aquatic Products and Navigation School going to Shanghai, Taihu, and other places for internships, as well as people going out to visit relatives and friends. Many of the passengers were riding a train for the first time.

    Prior to this, on April 10th, Yingtan Station had dispatched a mixed passenger-freight train directly to Xiamen, and the test run was successful. (Attached photo)

    鹰厦铁路全线通车
    本报厦门12日电　今天中午十二时，鹰厦铁路的终点厦门车站，开出了第一列开往江西鹰潭的直达客车。至此，全长六百九十多公里的鹰厦铁路全线通车，海防前线的厦门和祖国内地更加紧密地联结在一起了。
    今天早上，微雨初晴，厦门车站彩旗飘扬，一片欢腾。十一时二十分，厦门各界人士和驻军代表兴高采烈地来到了车站广场上。接着举行了庆祝通车的仪式。厦门市市长李文陵、驻军代表和铁道兵新线临时营业管理处代表先后讲话。李文陵市长说，鹰厦铁路修成以至今日全线通车，应该首先向日日夜夜筑路的军工、民工致谢。十一时五十分在人们欢呼和掌声中，少先队员把鲜花献给了列车长、司机长和列车员。十二时正，汽笛长鸣，列车在军乐声中缓缓开出厦门车站。这时，坐在车厢内的旅客频频向欢送群众挥手告别。
    这列直达客车挂有软席寝车、硬席寝车、儿童专车和简易客车等十五节车厢。乘客中有归国华侨、前往开发福建山区经济的劳动者和到上海、太湖等地实习的集美水产航海学校的学生，以及外出探亲访友的人们。其中有许多乘客都是第一次乘坐火车。
    在此以前，鹰潭车站在4月10日曾开出一列客货混合列车直达厦门，试车情况良好。（附图片）
