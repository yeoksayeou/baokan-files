Remembering the Days in the Soviet Union
    Li Chunqing

A few months ago, I participated in the National People's Congress delegation's visit to the Soviet Union and had the opportunity to meet Chairman Voroshilov more than once. I had long admired him as a great general with a hundred battles under his belt, and I imagined him to be imposing and full of vigor. Unexpectedly, I saw: Chairman Voroshilov was not particularly tall, his voice was not particularly loud, a smile often appeared on his face, and his conversation was as relaxed as a chat at home. He was a kind and benevolent elder, radiating a kind of auspicious soft light, like the winter sun, making people like to be close to him. Chairman Voroshilov, now that you are here, Beijing can see you, and the Chinese people can see you, which is a great honor.

I remember the days I spent in the Soviet Union:

Snowflakes danced in the streets of Moscow, like ten thousand horses galloping. The sky was yellow and gray, heavy as if it were about to collapse. We drove to the suburbs to visit the atomic energy power station and saw that the houses and trees were covered with a layer of white snow. The snow blocked the road, and the car moved very slowly. Suddenly the car in front stopped, and all the cars stopped. I saw a tall statue standing by the roadside, and around it, all the trees were silent. The statue had a bare back and a bulging chest, her hands crossed behind her back, palms facing the sky, her whole body bound by thick ropes, obviously unable to move, but her head was held high, and her eyes glared forward.

    "It's Zoya, Zoya!"
    "Zoya is from this village!"
We all bowed our heads in front of this heroine's statue.

Zoya's image left painful memories in my heart. But from here, I realized that the strength of the Soviet Union today has been achieved through countless sacrifices and battles. Frankly, I still find that a deep wound of war still exists in the Soviet Union. When you enter a department store, or sit in an opera house, or stroll down the street, as soon as you look up, you will strangely find that there are more women than men here. This phenomenon is especially noticeable in Leningrad. Where did their brothers, husbands, fathers and sons go?

Many bravely sacrificed in the war.

Losing loved ones is a deep pain in the world, and countless Soviet people have carried this pain for an entire generation.

I am not surprised by the cruelty of fascism, nor am I surprised by the imperialists' love of war. What surprises me is the Soviet people's ability to endure pain and their spirit of self-sacrifice. This is not only manifested in the past Great Patriotic War, but also in the arduous struggle in construction, the simplicity and endurance in life, and even more in the various aspects of relations with brotherly countries. It is enough to give just one example. - Today, meat is not very abundant in the Soviet Union, but the Soviet people still take meat to help the brotherly countries of Eastern Europe. Chairman Voroshilov, we welcome you, we respect the noble qualities of the Soviet people!

In the Soviet Union, I did not stay for a long time, and I did not go to many places. I did not see the wonders of the sun, nor did I see the icebergs of the Arctic, nor did I see the quiet Don River. But I already know that this country has vast territory, abundant resources, developed industry, and brilliant culture. I know that here there are: atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs and rockets. If the Soviet Union did not have these things, it would be difficult for us to say that the strength of the socialist camp is strong. But the Soviet Union does not flaunt its military power. Communism has lofty ideals, does not invade, loves peace, and is willing to coexist peacefully and compete peacefully with countries with different social systems.

Not to mention anything else. If knowledge is power, let's compare in this regard. In the fifth five-year plan, the Soviet Union trained more than twice as many engineers as the United States. By the time the sixth five-year plan is completed, the Soviet Union will have nearly ten million specialists. At present, the number of students in Soviet universities exceeds the total number of students in the United States, Britain, France, Italy and West Germany. Who has more knowledge and who has more strength?

I sat on the Tu-104 aircraft, meditating in the high sky. Nietzsche arrogantly believed that his superman philosophy was eight thousand feet above humanity, and he said: "Everything deep should rise to my height." Poor clown! The Tu-104 jet aircraft manufactured in the Soviet Union has risen to an altitude of 12,000 meters. I feel that Soviet science has risen to such a height: the poet's fantasy - the kind of fantasy that human beings can fly out of the earth and pick a few stars, today there is a possibility in the Soviet Union. Human science began with astronomy, shouldn't it go back to the era of developing astronomy?

Chairman Voroshilov, we welcome you, we admire the prosperity of the Soviet Union and the great achievements of science and technology.

Last November 28, we flew back to Moscow from Tashkent. Because of bad weather, we temporarily landed in Tbilisi, in the Georgian Republic. The local host took us into an exquisite restaurant, and he stood up and said: "Even if it's just a few minutes, we feel honored that the representatives of the Chinese people can set foot on our land." Then he looked at the table and muttered to himself in a low voice: "Ah, the weather, maybe it will keep you here overnight?"

Before long, the host stood up again, looking a little flustered, and said, "I have received definite information," and stopped after saying this, a look of frustration climbing onto his face, and suddenly his eyes were wet and his throat choked, "Please take a minute to have another drink! That silver-winged plane is about to take off."

The sincere friendship of the Soviet people towards the Chinese people is like this.

That was another occasion. On January 12 this year, we were on a train in the Moldavian Republic. The night was deep, and the earth was already asleep. The First Secretary of the Party Central Committee of this Republic, Gaofu Lie Luofu, opened the chatterbox, and he was very interested in talking. He talked about the history and geography here, the products and people's lives, the stories of the Great Patriotic War, about Pushkin... The Vice-Chairman of this Republic, Comrade Anshelokov, was also full of energy and told many stories and jokes. Both of them had specially rushed to Ungheni to meet us. When we arrived in Chisinau, it was already late, and they were forced to stop talking and hurried home. I saw a pair of dark shadows disappearing into the night, and a feeling of reluctance to part burned in my heart.

The Soviet people are like this when they meet the Chinese people, and they can't finish talking about it even in a thousand and one nights. Chairman Voroshilov, we welcome you, we thank the Soviet people for their brotherly friendship with the Chinese people.

I hope that Chairman Voroshilov can have as pleasant a time in China as we had in the Soviet Union, I hope that the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people will always be rich, and I hope that our two countries and other countries in the world will fly together to the distant future of mankind.

### 想起在苏联的那些日子

    想起在苏联的那些日子
    李纯青
    几个月前，我参加全国人民代表大会代表团访问苏联，有机会不止一次见到伏罗希洛夫主席。我久仰他是一位百战疆场的伟大将军，我想他一定是威风凛凛，神采奕奕。出人意料地我看到：伏罗希洛夫主席个子并不特别高，声音也不特别宏亮，脸上时时浮出微笑，谈吐安闲一如家常。他是一位仁厚的长者，发射着一种祥瑞的柔光，像冬天的太阳那样使人喜欢亲近。伏罗希洛夫主席，现在您来了，北京能够看到您，中国人民能够看到您，十分荣幸。
    我想起我在苏联的那些日子：
    雪花在莫斯科街中飞舞，像万马奔腾。天又黄又灰，沉甸甸地像要塌下来。我们驱车到郊外去参观原子能发电站，看见房子、树木都蒙上了一重皑皑的白雪。雪拥道路，汽车走得很慢。忽然前面的车停下来，所有的车都停下来了。我看见一个高高的塑像站在路旁，而周围，是万木无声。那塑像露着背，隆着胸，两手往后交叉着，掌心向天，全身捆着条条的粗绳，显然是动弹不得，但是她的头昂然，她的双眼向前方怒视。
      “是卓娅，卓娅呀！”
    “卓娅是这村子里的人！”
    我们不约而同地在这位女英雄的塑像面前低下头来。
    卓娅的形象在我心里留下痛苦的记忆。但是我从这里认识到，今天苏联国家的强盛是经受无数牺牲，战斗过来的。老实说，我还不时发现苏联至今还存在着一种深刻的战争创伤。当你进入百货商店，或者坐在歌舞剧院里，或者漫步在街头，只要你一举目，就会奇异地发现这里是女多于男。这种现象在列宁格勒特别显著。她们的兄弟、丈夫、父亲和儿子到哪里去了呢？
    很多是在战争中勇敢牺牲了。
    丧失亲人是人间一种深刻的痛苦，而无数的苏联人背着这个痛苦整整一代。
    我没有奇怪法西斯的残酷，也没有奇怪帝国主义的嗜好战争。我奇怪的是，苏联人民忍受痛苦的本领和自我牺牲的精神。这不但表现在过去的卫国战争中，而且表现在建设上的艰苦奋斗，生活上的朴素和忍受，更表现在对兄弟国家的各方面关系上。只消举出一端就可以知道了。——今天苏联的肉类并不十分充裕，但是苏联人民仍然把肉类拿去援助东欧的兄弟国家。伏罗希洛夫主席，我们欢迎您，我们尊敬苏联人民的高贵品质！
    在苏联，我呆的时间不长，去的地方不多，我没有看到太阳的奇景，没有看到北极的冰山，也没有看到静静的顿河。但我已经知道这个国家的领土辽阔，资源丰富，工业发达，文化灿烂。我知道这里有：原子弹、氢弹和火箭。如果苏联没有这些东西，我们就很难说社会主义阵营的力量是强大的。但是苏联并不炫耀武力。共产主义有着崇高的理想，不侵略，爱和平，愿意和不同社会制度的国家和平共处，和平竞赛。
    别的不说。如果说知识就是力量，让我们就这方面来比较一下吧。在第五个五年计划中，苏联培养出的工程师比美国多一倍有余。等第六个五年计划完成，苏联将有近一千万的专门人才。目前苏联高等学校学生人数，超过美、英、法、意、西德五国的总和。究竟谁的知识多，谁的力量强？
    我坐在图—104飞机上，在高空中冥想。尼采傲慢他的超人哲学高出人类八千尺，他说：“一切幽深的都应当上升到我的高处”。可怜这个小丑！苏联制造的图—104式喷气飞机已经上升到一万二千公尺的高空了。我觉得苏联科学已经上升到这样的高度：诗人的狂想——人类可以飞出地球，摘几颗星星下来的这种狂想，今天在苏联已存在着可能性。人类科学从天文开始，难道不应该回到发展天文时代去吗？
    伏罗希洛夫主席，我们欢迎您，我们羡慕苏联国家的富强和科学技术的伟大成就。
    去年11月28日，我们从塔什干乘飞机回莫斯科。因为天气不好，临时在格鲁吉亚共和国的梯比利斯降落。当地主人把我们接进一个精致的餐厅，他站起来就说：“那怕是几分钟，中国人民的代表能够踏到我们的土地，我们都觉得荣幸。”然后他的眼睛看着桌子，用低沉的声调自言自语：“啊，天气，也许会把你们留在这里过夜？”
    没有多久，主人又站起来，显得有点慌张，说：“我已经得到确切的情报”，说完这句就停下来，一阵懊丧的神色爬上他的脸孔，忽然眼睛湿润，喉咙哽咽，“请你们利用一分钟时间，再喝一杯！那架银翼的飞机就要起飞了。”
    苏联人民对中国人民的真挚友谊就是如此。
    那是另一个场合。今年1月12日，我们在摩尔达维亚共和国的列车上。夜深沉，大地已经熟睡了。这个共和国的党中央第一书记高甫列洛夫打开话盒子，谈话兴趣正浓。他谈到这里的历史和地理，物产和人民生活，谈到卫国战争的故事，谈到普希金……这个共和国的副主席安谢洛科夫同志也精神焕发，讲了许多话又讲了一个笑话。他们两位，都是特地赶到翁格尼来迎接我们的，到了基希涅夫已经是夜漏更残，他们才被迫收住话头，匆匆下车回家。我看见一对黑影子在黑夜中消逝，心里燃烧起十分惜别的感情。
    苏联人民碰到中国人民就是这样，一千零一夜也讲不完要讲的话。伏罗希洛夫主席，我们欢迎您，我们感谢苏联人民对中国人民那种兄弟的友谊。
    我希望伏罗希洛夫主席在中国能够像我们在苏联过得那样愉快，希望中苏两国人民的友谊永远丰富，希望我们两国和世界其它国家一齐飞翔到人类遥远的未来。
