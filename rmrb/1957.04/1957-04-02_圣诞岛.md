    Christmas Island
    Britain is to conduct hydrogen bomb tests on Christmas Island in the Pacific, and has arbitrarily designated over two million square kilometers of the Pacific high seas as a "restricted zone," stipulating that ships are not allowed to navigate within the "restricted zone" from March 1st to August 1st. Britain has built an airport and several barracks on the island, and on March 12th sent four "Valiant" jet bombers to the island in preparation for the hydrogen bomb tests. Such tests will not only poison the air throughout the Pacific region, but also seriously harm the interests of international shipping and fisheries. Therefore, Japan, Australia, Indonesia, and the British people resolutely demand that the British government stop these tests.
    Christmas Island is located on the equator, midway between Australia and Mexico. It is the largest atoll in the Pacific, with an area of 220 square miles, about 25 miles long and about 15 miles at its widest point. The island is low-lying, with many sand dunes and lakes in the east, and the west resembles a lobster's pair of giant claws, surrounding a clear, mirror-like coral lake. The island has less than one hundred residents, none of whom are native. The island produces coconuts, guano, pearl shells, etc. Although the island is on the equator, a cold current passes near the island, so the climate is mild.
    Christmas Island is situated between the equatorial current and the countercurrent. The "equatorial current" is a westward ocean current, and the countercurrent is an eastward ocean current. When crossing the Pacific, westward-bound ships sail with the equatorial current, and eastward-bound ships sail with the countercurrent, which can increase speed and save a lot of time and fuel.
    In 1777, when a British captain named Cook discovered this island, it was on the eve of Christmas, so it was named Christmas Island. After Britain occupied the island, it leased it to the "Central Pacific Coconut Plantation Company" in London for a term of eighty-seven years. This company hired dozens of Tahitians to collect coconuts, pearl shells, and guano from the island and transport them to Britain. At the end of 1936, the United States attempted to occupy the island as a military base. So in 1937, Britain sent a warship with many officials to reside permanently on the island and established a meteorological station, regularly issuing weather telegrams. In 1942, Japan occupied the island, and it was not until 1946 that it was re-occupied by Britain. But the United States has never given up the idea of seizing the island.
    The waters near Christmas Island are rich in tuna. The Japanese call this island the "Tuna Treasure House" of the Pacific, and fishing is possible all year round. According to the Japan Fisheries Association, if Japanese fishermen cannot fish here from March to August, they will lose 1 billion yen, which will seriously affect their lives.

    圣诞岛
    英国要在太平洋的圣诞岛进行氢弹试验，并且擅自在太平洋公海上划出二百万多平方公里为“禁区”，规定从3月1日到8月1日不准船只在“禁区”内航行。英国在岛上造好一个飞机场和若干兵营，在3月12日派了四架“勇士式”喷气轰炸机飞往该岛，准备参加氢弹试验。这种试验不仅将毒化整个太平洋地区的空气，而且严重地危害国际航运和渔业的利益。因此日本、澳大利亚、印度尼西亚和英国人民坚决要求英国政府停止这种试验。
    圣诞岛位于赤道上，正当澳洲和墨西哥的中途，是太平洋中最大的环状珊瑚岛，面积二百二十平方英里，长约二十五英里，最宽处约十五英里。岛很低，东部多沙丘和湖沼，西部好像龙虾的一对巨螯，围抱着清澈如镜的珊瑚湖。岛上的居民不到一百人，都不是土生居民。岛上产椰子鸟粪和珠贝等。该岛虽在赤道上，但冷流经过该岛附近，所以气候温和。
    圣诞岛处在赤道正流和逆流之间。“正流”是向西的洋流，逆流是向东的洋流。在横渡太平洋的时候，向西的船只顺着正流航行，向东的船只顺着逆流航行，都可以加快速度，节省许多时间和燃料。
    1777年英国有个船长科克发现这个岛时，正值圣诞节前夜，因此定名为圣诞岛。英国占领这个岛以后，就把它租给伦敦一家“中太平洋椰子种植有限公司”，租期八十七年。这个公司雇了几十个大赫岛人，采取岛上的椰子、珠贝和鸟粪，运往英国。1936年底，美国企图占领这个岛作为军事基地。于是英国在1937年派了一艘军舰，带了许多官员长驻该岛，并设立气象站，经常发布气象电报。1942年，日本占领这个岛，直到1946年才又被英国占领。但美国始终没有放弃夺取这个岛的念头。
    圣诞岛附近海面盛产鲔鱼，日本人称这个岛为太平洋的“鲔鱼宝库”，一年四季都能捕鱼。据日本渔业协会估计，日本渔民如果从3月到8月不能到这里捕鱼，他们就要损失十亿日元，将严重地影响他们的生活。
