When people sit in the stands of a stadium, they are often drawn to the thrilling and intense competition. However, many other interesting things happening in the stadium often go unnoticed. Here, we will share some interesting sights and sounds from inside and outside Shanghai's stadiums with sports enthusiasts.

Fang Rongfu and His Silver Whistle

Whenever there is an exciting soccer match in Shanghai, people can often see a short, stout referee in black clothes and trousers, busily running across the eight thousand square meter field, following the movement of the soccer ball. Shanghai soccer fans, upon hearing the "tweet, tweet" sound—a series of whistles with a special tone—know that the referee is Fang Rongfu. Fang Rongfu has not only been a soccer referee in Shanghai for over twenty years, but he has also been using the same silver whistle for over twenty years.

As early as 1935, when Fang Rongfu was twenty-two years old, he began to work as a soccer referee. He was originally a soccer player himself, playing center forward. At that time, some players had a bad style, and Fang Rongfu was once stabbed during a match. Later, he resolved to become a referee, using fair and just judgment to uphold lofty sportsmanship. However, in his fourteen-year refereeing career before Liberation, he suffered a lot of unreasonable insults.

After the Liberation of Shanghai, Fang Rongfu received respect from all sectors of society. When he entered the field, many spectators applauded to welcome him. When the Soviet "Locomotive" soccer team and the Yugoslav Youth soccer team came to Shanghai for friendly visits, Fang Rongfu's fair and decisive judgment in the matches was praised by the guests. When the Soviet "Zenith" soccer team visited China in 1955 and came to Shanghai, the team's deputy leader specially presented Fang Rongfu with a commemorative medal. In 1956, Fang Rongfu gloriously obtained the title of international soccer referee.

"Iron Leg" and the Goal Net

Many people have only heard of soccer balls being kicked into the goal net, but have never heard of a soccer ball being kicked through the goal net. However, Sun Jinshun, who has roamed the soccer field for thirty years, has indeed kicked a soccer ball through the goal net, and more than once. Therefore, Sun Jinshun earned the nickname "Iron Leg."

When Sun Jinshun recalls his past experiences, he always sighs with emotion. He represented China at the Olympic Games held in Berlin in 1936. At that time, the Kuomintang government did not provide the soccer team with travel expenses, so they had to compete all the way in Southeast Asia to raise funds. He said to people: Now seeing the country supporting sports so much, the younger generation is really fortunate. Therefore, he is determined to pass on his soccer experience to emerging soccer players. He is now the leader of the Shanghai Youth soccer team.

A few months ago, Wu Qixiang and Jia Youliang, soccer stars who played during the same period as Sun Jinshun, came to Shanghai. The old generals met again, and their enthusiasm for soccer was rekindled. So, they, along with some other veteran soccer players such as Zhang Banglun and Gao Baozheng, organized a veteran soccer team with an average age of over forty, and held three matches with some young soccer teams. This gave young fans the opportunity to admire the prowess of this fifty-two-year-old "Iron Leg."

The Knowledgeable Fan

The ball was kicked to the front of the goal again, and as soon as the forward raised his foot to shoot, a cheer went up from the stands: "It's in!" A Young Pioneer excitedly stood up and applauded vigorously. However, a middle-aged man next to him remained calm and patted the Young Pioneer on the shoulder, saying: "Hold your applause for a moment, it won't go in." No sooner said than done, the ball had already crossed the net and flew out of the end line.

On the field, the "Jilin" and "Hongqi" first-division soccer teams were competing. That day in Shanghai, the spring weather was chilly, and the sky was covered with dark clouds, but the Hongkou Stadium was still filled with nearly ten thousand spectators. The middle-aged man who made the accurate prediction said: "He has been watching soccer for more than twenty years, and just by looking at the players' positions and the angle of the kick, he knows whether the ball will go in."

No one has counted how many soccer fans there are in Shanghai. But whenever there are exciting soccer matches, just look at the Hongkou Stadium or the Jiangwan Stadium, which can accommodate tens of thousands of people, packed to the brim, and look at the "long snake formation" of hundreds of meters at the bus stops leading to the stadium, and you will know how many soccer fans there are in Shanghai.

In the Caoyang New Village workers' residential area, there is a famous soccer fan—Zheng Jiwu, a retired worker in his seventies. He often gives his son a special task, which is to buy tickets for him. With a ticket in hand, even on windy and rainy days, he would take his lunch box and enter the stadium early to choose a good seat.

Live Broadcast

A fierce international basketball match is taking place on the basketball court of the Shanghai Gymnasium. Underneath the electric scoreboard sits a young man wearing yellow-rimmed glasses, holding a silver microphone in his hand. He is doing a live broadcast:

"...The Belgrade women's team has a very tight defense, number five makes a feint, and passes it to number eight again, number eight cuts in—it's in. The score is now twenty-five to twenty, with the Shanghai women's team in the lead..."

People cannot help but admire the agility of vision and clear articulation of the announcer, Jin Xirun. In one second, countless changes can occur on the court, but he seems to have mastered a speed faster than the passing of the ball, reporting the ever-changing situation on the court vividly to soccer fans who are many times more numerous than those in the stadium but who did not buy tickets.

Jin Xirun is also a sports enthusiast, and he himself is a member of the Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station soccer team. He is familiar with the characteristics of many famous athletes. He has also developed a special "conditioned reflex," remembering the appearance and characteristics of a player as soon as he sees them, which brings him great convenience in live broadcasting.

Now, whenever there are exciting soccer matches in Shanghai, just turn on the radio, and you will hear the familiar voice of the announcer, and you can also hear the referee's whistle and the cheers of the audience. Sitting in front of the radio, people seem to see the match.

### 上海球场内外见闻

    上海球场内外见闻
    新华社记者　陆左华　张风
    当人们坐在球场看台上的时候，常常会被那些惊险，激烈的竞争场面吸引住了。但是，球场上其他许多有趣的事，却往往不大受人注意。这里，我们把最近在上海球场内外的几件有趣的见闻，告诉给爱好体育的读者们。
    方荣富和他的银笛
    每当上海举行精采的足球赛的时候，人们经常能够看到一位穿着黑色衣裤的矮胖的裁判员，他随着足球的活动方向，在八千多平方公尺的球场上忙碌地奔跑着。上海的球迷们只要听到“滴”“滴”——这种连吹几响，而且有着特殊音调的银笛声，就知道这个裁判员是方荣富。因为，方荣富不但在上海当了二十多年的足球裁判员，而且他吹的那只银笛，也一连用了二十多年。
    远在1935年，当方荣富二十二岁的时候，他就开始担任足球裁判。他原来也是足球健将，踢过中锋。那时候，一些球员作风恶劣，方荣富在比赛时曾经被刺伤。后来他立志做一个裁判员，用公平严正的判断来维护崇高的体育道德。但是，他在解放以前的十四年裁判生涯中，受了不少无理的污辱。
    上海解放以后，方荣富受到了社会各方面的尊敬。他一上场，很多观众就向他拍手表示欢迎。应邀来中国访问的苏联“火车头”足球队和南斯拉夫青年足球队来上海比赛时，方荣富在比赛中的公正而果断的判断，都受到了客人的赞扬。1955年来中国访问的苏联“泽尼特”足球队来上海时，这个队的副领队还特地把一枚纪念章送给了方荣富。1956年，方荣富光荣地获得了国际足球裁判的称号。
    “铁腿”和球网
    许多人都只听说过足球被踢进球网，却没有听说过足球踢穿球网的事。但是，在球场上驰骋了三十年的孙锦顺，的确把足球踢穿过球网，而且还不止踢穿过一次。因此，孙锦顺获得了“铁腿”的绰号。
    孙锦顺回忆起往日的遭遇的时候，总是感叹不止。他在1936年代表中国出席过在柏林举行的奥林匹克运动会。那时候，国民党政府不给足球队路费，他们只好在南洋一带一路比赛，一路筹集费用。他对人说：现在看到国家这样扶植体育事业，年青的一代真是幸福。因此，他决心把自己踢足球的经验传授给后起的足球运动员。他现在担任着上海青年足球队的领导。
    几个月之前，跟孙锦顺同一时期踢球的足球名将吴祺祥、贾幼良来到了上海。老将相逢，球兴勃起，于是，他们同另外一些球坛宿将张邦纶、高保正等人，组织了一个球员平均年龄在四十岁以上的老将足球队，并且同一些年青的足球队举行了三场比赛。这样，年青的球迷们也有机会欣赏到这位年已五十二岁的“铁腿”的雄姿。
    内行的球迷
    球又踢到了门前，前锋刚一抬脚准备射门，看台上随着发出了一阵欢呼“进去了！”一位少先队员兴奋得站了起来，使劲鼓掌。但是，旁边的一位中年人却镇静如常，拍着少先队员的肩膀说：“先慢点拍手，不会进去的”。说时迟，那时快，球儿早已越网而过，飞出了端线。
    场上是“吉林”和“红旗”两个甲级足球队在比赛。这天上海春寒料峭，天空密布阴云，虹口体育场上还是坐满近万名观众。这位作了准确预测的中年人说：“他看了二十多年球，只要看球员站的位置和踢的角度，就晓得这只球能不能进去了。”
    没有人统计过上海有多少球迷。但是每逢有精彩的球赛，只要看一看可以容纳几万人的虹口体育场或江湾体育场上挤得满坑满谷的景象，看一看通向球场方面的汽车站上蜿蜒几百公尺的“长蛇阵”，就知道上海球迷之多了。
    在工人住宅区曹杨新村，有一位出名的球迷——七十多岁的退休工人郑辑五。他经常交给儿子一个特殊任务，就是替他买球票。有了球票，即使是刮风下雨天，他也拿着饭盒子，提早入场去选择一个好位置。
    实况广播
    上海市体育馆的篮球场上正在进行着激烈的国际篮球比赛。电动记分牌下面坐着一位戴黄边眼镜的青年人，手里拿着银色的话筒，他正在作实况广播：
    “……贝尔格莱德市女子队防守很严，五号一个假动作，又传给八号，八号切进——进去了。现在场上的比数是二十五比二十，上海市女子队占先。……”
    人们不能不佩服这位播音员金锡润的灵敏的视觉和清晰的口齿。在一秒钟里，球场上不知道要发生多少变化，但是他似乎掌握了比球儿传递更快的速度，把球场上的千变万化，绘形绘色地报告给比在球场上多出不知多少倍的、但是没有买到入场券的球迷。
    金锡润也是一个体育爱好者，他自己是上海人民广播电台足球队的队员。他熟悉许多著名运动员的特点。他还养成了一种特殊的“条件反射”，看到一个球员，就记住他的容貌和特征，这给他在实况广播时带来很大的便利。
    现在，每逢上海举行精彩的球赛，只要开开收音机，就会听到播音员的熟悉的声音，也能听到裁判员的哨子声，观众的欢呼声。坐在收音机前，人们犹如看到了这场比赛。
