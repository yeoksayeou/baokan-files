    The Miser (An Indian Story)
    A miser went to the mosque. On the way, he suddenly remembered that he had forgotten to turn off the light when he left home, so he immediately turned back. When he got to the door of his house, he shouted to the maid: "You turned off the light, right! Don't open the door, or the hinges on the door will grind again."
    "Oh, sir," the maid said:
    "You came back halfway, aren't you afraid of wearing out the soles of your shoes?"
    "Smart girl! Don't worry," the miser replied: "I've already taken them off, walking barefoot, with my shoes tucked under my arm." (Translated by Qi Xiang and Wang Wei)

    吝啬鬼（印度故事）
    一个吝啬鬼上清真寺去，路上忽然想起他离家时忘了熄灯，于是立刻转回去。走到家门口，他向女仆喊道：“你关了灯吧！门不要开了，不然门上的铰链又要磨一下。”
    “噢，先生，”女仆说道：
    “您从半路上回来，不怕磨了自己的鞋底？”
    “聪明人！你不用操心，”吝啬鬼回答说：“我已经脱掉了，赤脚走的，鞋子夹在胳肢窝里。”　（其祥、王未译）
