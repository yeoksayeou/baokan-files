    The Life of Japanese Shipyard Workers
    Pei Da

    "Working on Sundays, I leave home with a shameful, furtive air. Why should I do that? I haven't done anything wrong! Shouldn't I walk to the big factory in a dignified manner? The neighbors say, 'Working like that, and still so shabby.' Perhaps I just have this unspeakable feeling!"

    This is the beginning of a self-description written by a Japanese shipyard worker. He is a boiler repairman. To avoid injuring his hands, he spends his own money to buy five pairs of gloves each month. But the wages he earns are "too little to mention." He works overtime every day, sometimes nearly 100 hours a month, and weekends are a thing of the past. When he gets home, his wife says, "You must be roasting in the boiler today?" He always answers her, "It'll be hot tomorrow too!"

    It is common for Japanese shipyard workers to work overtime for two or three hours every day. They leave home in the morning before their children are awake, and when they return at night, the children are already asleep. Workers often joke, "Our children must have a sleeping sickness, they never seem to be awake!"

    These situations were discussed by the representatives of the Japanese Shipyard Workers Delegation during an interview with reporters. Last year, the Japanese shipbuilding industry experienced unprecedented prosperity, with its shipbuilding volume surpassing that of Britain, ranking first in the world. According to the delegation's written materials, in the first seven months of fiscal year 1956, the amount of steel ships built reached 874,000 gross tons, an increase of 444,000 tons compared to the entire year of 1954. Due to the improvement of technology and the increase of labor efficiency by shipyard workers, the number of labor hours required to build the same tonnage of ships last year was reduced by 39% compared to 1950, and the amount of steel used was reduced by 20%. This has brought huge profits to shipbuilding capitalists, especially monopoly capital shipbuilding enterprises. Taking Mitsubishi Shipbuilding Company, Japan's largest, as an example, its net profit for the first half of fiscal year 1956 was 2.3 billion yen, and the profit rate was almost 100%. Other major shipbuilding enterprises such as Mitsubishi Japan, Kawasaki, Hitachi, and Ishikawajima also had similar profit situations.

    Prosperity belongs to the capitalists, but the economic situation of the workers' families is becoming increasingly difficult. According to the representatives, Japanese shipyard workers' wages last year only increased by about 12% compared to 1954. This snail-like rate of increase cannot keep up with the rise in prices. One worker with a fixed monthly income of 18,100 yen, after deducting taxes, insurance fees, coal fees, etc., has an actual income of only 12,700 yen. But for a family of five, monthly rent costs 1,000 yen, staple food costs 4,000 yen, non-staple food costs 4,500 yen, and buying some odds and ends costs at least 15,000 yen per month. If his children have to go to school, the expenses will be even greater. The shortfall needs to be made up by working overtime, but overtime means eating more, overwork leads to accidents, and diseases also increase, resulting in a significant increase in living expenses. Under these difficult circumstances, how can they dare to have any cultural or recreational aspirations!

    This is still the family life situation of permanent workers, and the situation of temporary workers is even worse. The wages of ordinary temporary workers are only equivalent to 60% of the wages of permanent workers, and they cannot enjoy labor insurance benefits. But in order to work more days, they must work desperately. The number of these temporary workers is increasing every year. In the shipbuilding industry, the number of temporary workers last year more than doubled compared to 1954. Obviously, this is also a way for capitalists to make money.

    Overtime work and poor working conditions make the casualties in the shipbuilding industry very serious. In 1955, there were more than 8,700 casualty accidents in the shipbuilding industry, resulting in 52 deaths and more than 8,600 injuries.

    Shipyard workers' wages are considered to be the highest. In comparison, the wages of textile workers are much lower. Young textile workers who have worked for five years earn a monthly wage of 7,500 yen for men and only 5,000 yen for women. If they don't work overtime, they can barely afford three meals a day. Under these circumstances, what are the workers' demands? According to the representatives, ordinary Japanese workers currently hope to be able to get off work on time once or twice a week, and it would be a joy to go home and eat with their families. Speaking of this, the representatives expressed their admiration for the life of Chinese workers. They said that it is such a happy thing for Chinese workers to get off work on time, go home to eat, and walk on the streets with their wives and children! It is even more admirable that young Chinese workers have the opportunity to study.

    The representatives were very interested in the progress of Chinese workers. Mr. Sakae Matsumura said: "I worked in a factory in Fushun for seven years. When I returned to Japan eleven years ago, I was worried about whether that factory could continue to operate. This time I went to Fushun and talked with old friends, which moved me very much. The factory has developed, and my friends have all taken up positions above section chief. A child laborer who used to work under me when he was fourteen or fifteen years old is now the chairman of the grassroots trade union. This time I returned to Japan with another kind of worry. I thought, if I go to work in that factory again, I'm afraid I will have to learn from my apprentice."

    Mr. Zenkichi Sato, the head of the delegation, said: China has eliminated the exploitation system, Chairman Mao has led well, 600 million people are united, and China's construction is developing at an astonishing rate. Japanese workers are very impressed to see this situation, and we are very happy to be able to provide some technical assistance to Chinese worker brothers. (Attached picture)

    Currently, Japanese workers are generally launching a spring struggle to demand improved treatment. The picture shows the scene of the Tokyo Metropolitan Trade Union Confederation holding a workers' congress on March 11.

    日本造船工人的生活
    裴达
    “星期天上班，害臊似的躲躲闪闪离开了家。为什么要那样呢？我没有作什么坏事啊！到大工厂去上班，大大方方地走不是很好吗？街坊说：‘那样地干活还这么寒酸’。也许我就是有着这样说不出来的心情吧！”
    这是一个日本造船业工人写的一篇自述的开头。他是一个修理锅炉的工人。为了避免把手碰伤，他每月要用自己的钱买五双手套。但是他所得的工钱，却“少得说不出口来”。他每天要加班，有时一个月要加班将近一百小时，星期假日和他绝了缘。当他回家的时候，妻子说：“今天在锅炉里热坏了吧？”他总是这样回答她：“明天也要热呀！”
    日本造船工人每天加班两三个小时是很普通的事。早晨他们从家里出来，孩子还没有起床，晚上回去，孩子早就睡着了。工人们常常开玩笑说：“咱们家的孩子都得了睡觉病，怎么总是不见起床呢？”
    这些情况是日本造船工人访华代表团的代表们在记者访问他们的时候谈的。去年日本造船业空前繁荣，造船量超过英国，跃居世界第一位。据代表团的书面材料，1956年度前七个月，钢船建造量达到八十七万四千总吨，比1954年全年度多造四十四万四千吨。由于造船工人改进技术，提高劳动效率，建造同样吨位的船舶去年所需的工数比1950年降低了39％，钢材使用量降低了20％。这就给造船业资本家特别是垄断资本的造船企业，带来了庞大利润。以日本最大的三菱造船公司为例，1956年度上期纯利润是二十三亿日元，利润率几乎达到100％。其他如三菱日本、川崎、日立、石川岛等巨大造船企业的获利情况，也大体相同。
    繁荣是资本家的，而工人家庭的经济情况却越来越困难了。据代表们谈，去年日本造船工人的工资只比1954年增长12％左右。这种蜗牛式的上升速度，怎么也赶不上物价的上涨。有一个每月有固定收入一万八千一百日元的工人，除去税金、保险费、煤炭费等，实际收入只有一万二千七百日元。而全家大小五口，每月付房租一千日元，主食费四千日元，副食费四千五百日元，再买些零碎东西，最少每月需要一万五千日元。如果他的孩子要上学，开支就更大了。不足之数需要他加班工作来填补，可是，一加班就要多吃，过度疲劳就要发生事故，疾病也增多了，结果使生活费大大增加。在这种困苦情况下，哪敢有什么文化娱乐生活的奢望呢！
    这还是固定工人的家庭生活情况，临时工就更苦了。一般的临时工的工资只相当于固定工人工资的60％，而且不能享受劳保福利。但是为了多干几天活，他们就必须拼命地劳动。这种临时工每年在增加。在造船业中，去年的临时工就比1954年增加一倍以上。很明显，这也是资本家的一个生财之道。
    加班加点，劳动条件恶劣，使造船业的伤亡事故十分严重。1955年造船业伤亡事故达八千七百多件，死五十二人，受伤的达八千六百多人。
    造船工人的工资算是最高的。比较起来，纺织工人的工资就差的太多了。工作了五年的青年纺织工人，男工每月工资是七千五百日元，女工只有五千日元。他们不延长工作时间，几乎吃不上三顿饱饭。在这种情况下，工人们的要求是什么呢？据代表们谈，目前日本普通工人都希望每周有一两次按时下班，回家同亲人一起吃饭就是高兴的事了。说到这里，代表们对中国职工生活表示羡慕。他们说，中国工人按时下班，回家吃饭，带着妻儿街上走走，是多么幸福的事啊！中国青年工人还有机会学习，更值得羡慕了。
    代表们对中国工人的进步感到很大兴趣。松村荣先生说：“我在抚顺的一个工厂工作过七年，十一年前我回日本的时候，曾担心那个工厂是否能继续办下去。这次我到了抚顺，和老朋友谈过话，使我非常感动。工厂发展了，朋友们都担任了科长以上的职务。过去在我手下干活的一个十四、五岁的童工，现在当了基层工会主席。这次我回日本有着另外一种忧虑，我想，如果我还到那个工厂去工作，恐怕要向我的徒弟学习了。”
    代表团团长佐藤善吉先生说：中国消除了剥削制度，毛主席领导得好，六亿人民团结一致，中国建设事业正以惊人的速度向前发展。日本工人看到这种情况非常感佩，我们很高兴在技术上能对中国工人兄弟有所帮助。（附图片）
    目前，日本工人普遍展开要求改善待遇的春季斗争。图为3月11日东京都工会联合会举行职工大会的情形。
