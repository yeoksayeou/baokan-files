Wheat Harvest in Overseas Chinese Hometowns Along the Fujian Coast

    (Our report) The 1,560,000 mu of wheat in the overseas Chinese hometowns along the Fujian coast—Jinjiang, Longxi Special District and the suburbs of Xiamen—has begun to be harvested and threshed. Judging from the already harvested areas, wheat production will increase by 10% compared to last year.

    The people of the overseas Chinese hometowns are enthusiastically selling the new wheat to the state after the bumper harvest. Many relatives of overseas Chinese are also preparing to continue selling any surplus wheat that they do not need after fulfilling the unified purchase quotas. (Huang Zhenfeng, Sun Daying)

    福建沿海侨乡小麦丰收
    本报讯　福建沿海侨乡——晋江、龙溪专区和厦门市郊的一百五十六万多亩小麦，已经开始收刈登场。从已收的情况来看，小麦产量将比去年增产一成。
    丰收后的侨乡人民，踊跃地把新麦卖给国家。许多侨眷还准备在完成统购后，继续出售用不完的余麦。　（黄振峰、孙大莹）
