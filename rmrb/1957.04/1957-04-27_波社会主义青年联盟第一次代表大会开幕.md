Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, April 26th: The first congress of the Polish Socialist Youth League opened in Warsaw on April 25th. The agenda of the congress includes the adoption of an ideological and political declaration, the adoption of the League's constitution, and the election of the League's central leadership. More than 730 delegates attended the meeting, representing approximately 60,000 members.

    Gomulka attended the congress and delivered a speech. He pointed out that the Party has the right to guide the Socialist Youth League in the struggle as a teacher and educator.

    Gomulka pointed out that the activities of the Socialist Youth League should inherit the fine traditions of its predecessor, the Polish Youth League, an organization that cultivated countless outstanding socialist fighters under unfavorable conditions. The intention of some members and leaders of the Socialist Youth League to completely obliterate all the achievements of the People's Poland over the past twelve years and all the achievements of the Polish Youth League is absurd and wrong. The Party will never forget the great contribution of the Polish Youth League to the cause of building People's Poland. The Socialist Youth League should avoid the mistakes made by the Polish Youth League, but should draw valuable lessons from its achievements; it should follow its example and strive to increase production and carry out labor competitions.

    Gomulka then pointed out that the Socialist Youth League has many shortcomings in its development. There is a lot of inflammatory talk and empty rhetoric. Empty noise replaces action. The factors that cause the League's current difficulties cannot be eliminated without completely eliminating these shortcomings. The youth of the working class should become the core of the League. The political nature of the Youth League's activities, as understood by the Party, lies in it becoming a loyal comrade of the Party in the struggle for socialism. Gomulka also called on the Socialist Youth League to strengthen its ties with the young masses.

    Lenk, First Secretary of the Provisional Central Committee of the Socialist Youth League, delivered a report to the congress on the tasks of the League and other issues. He pointed out that the League stands with the United Workers' Party and should be the organization of the most politically conscious working youth, students, and young intellectuals. He also pointed out that within the League, respect for different opinions and freedom of open discussion should be respected; at the same time, the League's discipline should be strengthened, and members have an obligation to implement resolutions passed by the majority.

    The meeting then began discussions.

    波社会主义青年联盟第一次代表大会开幕
    新华社华沙26日电　波兰社会主义青年联盟第一次代表大会4月25日在华沙开幕。大会议程包括通过思想和政治宣言、通过盟章和选举联盟中央领导机构。出席会议代表有七百三十多人，代表着约六万盟员。
    哥穆尔卡参加了这次大会，并且讲了话。他指出，党有权利作为老师和教育者在斗争中指导社会主义青年联盟。
    哥穆尔卡指出，社会主义青年联盟的活动应当继承它的先驱者——波兰青年联盟——的优良传统，这个组织曾经在不很有利的条件下培养出无数优秀的社会主义战士。社会主义青年联盟有些盟员和领导人想完全抹杀人民波兰十二年来的一切成就和波兰青年联盟的一切成就，这种意图是荒谬、错误的。党永远不会忘记波兰青年联盟在建设人民波兰的事业中的伟大贡献。社会主义青年联盟应该避免波兰青年联盟所犯的错误，但是要从它的成就中吸取宝贵的东西；应该仿照它的榜样，努力提高生产和开展劳动竞赛。
    哥穆尔卡接着指出，社会主义青年联盟在发展中有着许多错误。煽动言论和空谈很多。空洞的喧声代替了行动。不完全消除这些错误就不能消灭造成联盟当前困难的因素。工人阶级的青年应该成为联盟的核心。党所理解的青年联盟活动的政治性质在于它成为党在为社会主义的斗争中的忠实同志。哥穆尔卡还要求社会主义青年联盟加强同青年群众的联系。
    社会主义青年联盟临时中央委员会第一书记伦克就联盟的任务等问题向大会作了报告。他指出，联盟是同统一工人党站在一起的，它应当是政治上最觉悟的劳动青年、学生和青年知识分子的组织。他还指出，在联盟内部，应当尊重不同的意见和公开讨论的自由；同时也应当巩固联盟的纪律，盟员有义务执行多数通过的决议。
    接着，会议开始进行讨论。
