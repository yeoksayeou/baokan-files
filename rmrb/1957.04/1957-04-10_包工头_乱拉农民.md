    "Foreman" Randomly Recruits Farmers
    After units such as the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant, the Pingshantou construction site, the Nanshan Mine, and the 804 Exploration Team contracted out certain projects to private individuals, "foremen" contracting for projects such as yellow sand, yellow mud, and stone slabs emerged in Ma'anshan, Xiangshan, and other places.
    These foremen privately hire disaster victims from other places and local farmers to work, exploiting their labor. The foreman Qiu Bangshu, who contracts for yellow sand, receives a contract price of 6.6 yuan per cubic meter from the mine, but he only pays the workers 4.4 yuan. Therefore, the employed farmers are very dissatisfied. I suggest that the local labor department and employing units quickly correct this.

    “包工头”乱拉农民
    马鞍山铁厂、平山头建筑工地、南山矿场、八○四勘探队等单位，把某些工程承包给私人以后，在马鞍山、向山等地出现了包黄砂、黄泥土、石片等工程的包工头。
    这些包工头，私自招雇外地灾民和当地农民作工，剥削农民的劳动。包黄砂子的工头丘邦书，从矿上包的每方黄砂工价是六元六角，他发给工人只四元四角。因此，被雇用的农民非常不满。我建议当地劳动部门和用人单位赶快纠正。
