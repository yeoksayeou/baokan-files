    Don't "Stop Eating Because of a Choking Incident"
    After the implementation of self-funded newspaper and magazine subscriptions last year, some post offices, in order to facilitate individual subscriptions for readers, formulated many distribution methods to benefit readers. For example, when readers subscribed to newspapers and magazines, the subscription fees could be uniformly deducted during salary distribution at their work units; they could collectively subscribe through the promotion stations in their work units, and the post office could deliver them to each person's residence; and they could even be delivered to dormitories on holidays (usually delivered to the office). These methods were very popular among the masses and played a certain role in promoting self-funded newspaper and magazine subscriptions. However, recently some post offices have cancelled these methods that were welcomed by the masses. It is said that this is because the allocated quota for paper supply for some newspapers and magazines has been reached, and the number of issues needs to be limited (in fact, some newspapers and magazines can still be fully supplied). They feel that if some need to be restricted and others need to be developed, it would be very "difficult," so it is better to simply cancel those subscription methods that are convenient for the masses and welcomed by the masses, and restrict them all uniformly.
    Some time ago, many retail stores and supply and marketing cooperatives in Beijing retailed various newspapers. Readers found it very convenient. However, recently, because the distribution quota for some newspapers has been reached and a portion of retail sales needs to be reduced, the post office has completely stopped selling all kinds of newspapers—including newspapers that can still be supplied to readers in large quantities—at all retail stores and supply and marketing cooperatives throughout the city.
    As a reader, if a certain newspaper or magazine cannot be subscribed to or bought because the quota has been reached, there should be no complaints, because the needs should be subject to the possible conditions. But if, for this reason, some distribution methods that are convenient for readers are collectively and uniformly cancelled, and even the issuance of newspapers and magazines that can still be supplied to readers is also restricted, then that is not right.
    In my opinion, this approach is a bias; it is "stopping eating because of a choking incident." Hua Xinyuan

### 不要“因噎废食”

    不要“因噎废食”
    去年实行自费订阅报刊后，有些邮局为了便利读者个人订阅报刊，曾定了好些便利读者的发行办法。如读者订阅报刊，可以在本单位发薪时统一扣付报费；可以在本单位推广站集体订阅，邮局可分别投送到各人的住处；例假日还可送到宿舍（平时送到办公处）。这些办法，都是很受群众欢迎的，对贯彻自费订阅报刊，也起了一定的推动作用。可是最近有的邮局已把这些为群众所欢迎的办法取销了。据说这是因为有一部分报刊因纸张供应的定额已满，对发行数量需要加以限制的缘故（其实有些报刊还可以充分供应）。他们觉得，如果有的要限制，有的又要发展，那就很“难办”，不如干脆取消那些对群众便利、受群众欢迎的订阅办法，一律加以限制。
    前些日子，北京市许多零售商店和供销社都零售各种报纸。读者感到很方便。可是最近因有些报纸的发行定额已满，需要压缩一部分零售，而邮局却将全市各零售店和供销社零售的各种报纸——包括还可以大量供应读者的报纸——也全部停售了。
    作为一个读者来说，如果某种报刊因定额已满而订不到或买不到，应该是毫无怨言的，这是因为需要应服从于可能的条件。但如果因此而把便利读者的一些发行办法笼统地一律加以取消，甚至对还可以供应读者的报刊也同样加以限制发行，那就不对了。
    我看这种作法是一种偏向，是“因噎废食”。　华信元
