    Strengthen Unity, Improve Film Work
    Xia Yan
    Since last autumn, heated discussions about Chinese film issues have unfolded in the newspapers and periodicals of Beijing and Shanghai. In addition to literary and art workers and film workers, a large number of film enthusiasts have also participated in the discussions and expressed many correct and useful opinions. This discussion shows the sincere concern of the people for the film industry, and also shows that there are indeed many errors and shortcomings in our film work.
    In recent years, many of our films have been loved and welcomed by the people, but the people have also expressed dissatisfaction with some films that are of poor quality and boring. They hope to have the opportunity to express their opinions and make criticisms. Since the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" was put forward, the organizers and creators of film work have been exploring ways to improve leadership methods and change the organizational forms of artistic creation, so this discussion provides an opportunity to gather wisdom, listen to various opinions, and correct errors and shortcomings. In this discussion, most of the criticisms are correct and the opinions are useful, but at the same time, there are inevitably some one-sided and incorrect views. Some people do not see the fundamental changes and development of China's film industry since liberation, and adopt a nihilistic attitude to negate everything, and waver in the direction of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers; others only see the achievements of the work, and are unwilling to face up to the shortcomings and errors in the work, and adopt an unwelcome or even rejecting attitude towards criticisms from the masses. Obviously, both of these attitudes are wrong. Our attitude is to affirm achievements, adhere to the policy of film serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and at the same time, resolutely overcome shortcomings and correct errors.
    This discussion involves a wide range and many issues. In this article, we intend to focus on the following issues: First, the evaluation of China's films in the past eight years; second, the evaluation of China's films before liberation; third, strengthening the unity of film workers and improving the leadership of film work.
    Before discussing these issues, we must first clearly resolve a fundamental issue, that is, the nature of film work and the position of film work in the entire revolutionary work. Regarding this issue, as early as 1907, Lenin pointed out: "When the film is in the hands of vulgar speculators, it often leads the masses into depravity with bad scripts, and it brings more harm than benefit. However, when the masses control the film, and when it is in the hands of genuine socialist cultural workers, it is one of the most powerful tools for educating the masses." Film is the most popular art that directly contacts millions of people through artistic images at all times, and it has an unparalleled and enormous power to influence the masses spiritually. Therefore, the task of revolutionary film workers is first and foremost to strive to master this sharp weapon to reflect the demands and wishes of the people and serve the revolutionary political struggle. Comrade Mao Zedong also instructed us: "The position of the Party's literary and art work in the Party's entire revolutionary work has been determined and arranged; it is subordinate to the revolutionary tasks prescribed by the Party in a certain revolutionary period." Art must be subordinate to politics, and art must serve the revolutionary struggle and the laboring masses. Therefore, whether Chinese films in the two stages of democratic revolution and socialist revolution are subordinate to the prescribed revolutionary tasks, and whether they reflect the interests and demands of the broad masses of people, is the question we must first answer when examining film work.
    Film serving whom is a matter of principle and policy. We must adhere to and implement the policy of film serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. However, when working according to this policy, there is also the question of how to serve and how to serve better. Because of this, the first issue we should clarify in this discussion should be: whether the basic road of Chinese films is correct, whether it is subordinate to the interests of the revolution and the interests of the people, and whether it has implemented the policy of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers; secondly, we must also check the shortcomings and errors in leadership work and artistic creation in the process of advancing along this road. If we do not adhere to the policy of literature and art serving politics and film serving workers, peasants, and soldiers from the standpoint of the working class, our work will lose its direction; on the other hand, if we do not accept the supervision and criticism of the masses, and do not correct the errors and shortcomings in our work, then the correct policy cannot be effectively implemented, and we cannot produce works that are beneficial to the masses and welcomed by the masses.
    Starting from this basic attitude, we can more easily touch on the issue of the achievements and shortcomings of Chinese films in the past eight years and the evaluation of Chinese films before liberation, which were first mentioned in this discussion.
    I Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, China's film industry has achieved epoch-making development and progress. We have not only thoroughly eliminated imperialist reactionary films in a short period of time, but also expanded the audience from less than 50 million people per year in 1949 (mainly urban audiences, of which more than 80% were audiences of American films) to 1.39 billion people per year in 1956 (of which urban audiences accounted for 39% of the total). More than 6,000 film projection teams have been established from scratch, forming a national-scale projection network. More importantly, many feature films that truthfully reflect the Chinese revolution and the lives of the people and are of high quality have been produced, such as "The White-Haired Girl", "Steel Warrior", "Dong Cunrui" and other films have won unanimous praise from everyone. In addition, thousands of newsreels and documentaries that promptly reflect the face of New China have been produced, and a large number of Soviet and people's democratic countries' films with high ideological and artistic quality have been dubbed. In this way, a new situation has emerged in the history of Chinese films. That is, in a very short period of time, we have squeezed out American films that have occupied the Chinese film market for 30 years, and used new, healthy and educational films to meet the cultural needs of the people.
    It should be particularly emphasized here that, since the liberation, all kinds of films have resolutely implemented the policy of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, and since the vast majority of film workers have significantly improved their thinking and art through learning and self-transformation, these films have a fundamental difference from the films before liberation. Not to mention those purely profit-making, yellow, and low-level films before liberation, even progressive films often expressed sympathy for the oppressed people from the standpoint of revolutionary petty bourgeoisie, using roundabout and concealed satirical techniques; while today's people's films clearly stand on the standpoint of the working class, and use clear class viewpoints to truthfully describe the lives, struggles, and wishes of the working people. Chinese films have gone through a difficult journey of 20 to 30 years, and have since embarked on a broad road. Chinese film workers have gone through long-term struggles and explorations, and have since gained the opportunity to serve the people wholeheartedly. Chinese films have presented a brand-new look, which is an epoch-making change. New people, new things, new ideas and feelings, and new moral standards have appeared on the Chinese screen. Chinese films tell the people through the screen: where the victory of the people's revolution comes from, what path the Chinese revolution has gone through, how many difficulties it has experienced, and how to guarantee victory and strive for a better future. 1.3 billion people is not a small number, but more importantly, the inspiration and education that these hundreds of millions of people have received through the screen. The new film not only gave people a strong revolutionary ideological education, but also changed the unhealthy tastes of many film audiences in the past. On this point, we believe that although there are still many shortcomings in film work in the past eight years—even very serious shortcomings—it has already embarked on a solid road of serving the working people, making film a tool for educating and inspiring the people, and making great contributions to socialist transformation and the socialist revolution, which must be given sufficient estimation and should never be obliterated. If we do not fully estimate the achievements of this basic nature, and confuse the correct direction of Chinese film work with some shortcomings and errors in leadership work, thus doubting and wavering in the policy of literature and art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, this view and idea is undoubtedly one-sided and harmful.
    The article "The Gongs and Drums of Films" written by the commentator of "Wenyi Bao" in the 23rd issue of "Wenyi Bao" in 1956 and the article "For Progress" published by the same author under the pseudonym Zhu Zhuzhu in the "Wenhui Bao" on January 4th, showed the error of one-sidedness. This author used a nihilistic attitude to negate the achievements of film work since the establishment of New China, and one-sidedly regarded the box office value of a few big city cinemas as the only "criterion for testing problems", believing that the films since liberation were completely terrible, and the reason was that "the proportion of themes was as much as possible to describe workers, peasants, and soldiers." He did not understand the fundamental difference in the basic nature between progressive films before liberation and people's films after liberation, and demanded that our film industry "regress" back. He even questioned the necessity of the Party and government's leadership over the film industry, believing that the stronger the Party and government's leadership over the film industry, the less good films would be produced. He negated the necessary "theme selection plan" in the entire film production, and called the ideological and professional learning of film artists "the annual evangelism." He used one-sidedness to oppose one-sidedness, and used sectarianism to oppose sectarianism. As a result, it did not promote the unity of film workers, but deepened the gap between them, and did not encourage everyone to overcome shortcomings and improve work, but spread pessimistic and disappointed emotions, causing people to lose confidence. According to this commentator's opinion, we would only have to abolish the policy of film serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, abolish the Party's leadership over film work, and let films regress to the capitalist road. This is obviously very wrong and harmful.
    In this discussion, many film workers criticized the methods and methods of artistic leadership, such as over-concentration of leadership, too many levels of censorship, narrow understanding of the direction of workers, peasants, and soldiers in filmmaking ideas, mechanical regulations on the proportion of themes, unrealistic film production plans, inappropriate requirements for film content, and the use of many rules and regulations to interfere in the details of artistic creation. These phenomena do exist. After liberation, we took over the dilapidated film factory run by the Kuomintang government, and later nationalized private film factories. Film practitioners came from all sides, with different experiences, different ideas, and lacking mutual understanding and common language. In this case, the implementation of unified and centralized leadership and a higher-level censorship system for films was completely necessary. However, the situation of over-concentration of leadership and too many levels of censorship was not changed accordingly and in a timely manner when the situation had changed, which hindered and bound the enthusiasm and initiative of film creators and leaders of various factories. Emphasizing that films should serve workers and peasants is always needed and correct. However, films serving workers, peasants, and soldiers does not mean that films should not reflect themes other than workers, peasants, and soldiers. On the contrary, the Party and artists' organizations have repeatedly called on writers to reflect the struggles and lives of the Chinese people in the past and today with a wider range of themes and richer styles. The masses need films of various themes, and need to understand reality and increase knowledge from today's struggles and past struggles. Therefore, it is undoubtedly wrong to narrowly understand serving workers, peasants, and soldiers as only reflecting the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Our films had a particularly narrow range of themes for a period of time, which was related to the narrow views of some comrades. However, the view that the shortcomings of film work and the tendency of conceptualization and formalism in film creation were due to "describing workers, peasants, and soldiers as much as possible in the proportion of themes" is not correct. Facts show that, among the feature films produced in recent years, there are not too many but too few films with workers, peasants, and soldiers as the themes. The lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers are infinitely rich, and the tendency of formalism and conceptualization is by no means because they wrote about the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Where is the problem? From the perspective of leadership, this is because, during a period of time, the film leadership did not proceed from the actual situation of the existing artistic and technical personnel, and subjectively planned and called for the production of so-called "epic" and "monumental" works that summarized the entire historical outlook, and at the same time, it was too anxious to require films to reflect the current political movements and mechanically require films to promote current policies and decrees; coupled with the influence of the crude literary and art criticism that prevailed in a period of time, the artistic leaders lacked independent thinking ability and often used rigid formulas and dogmas to measure artistic works; in this way, on the one hand, it promoted the tendency of formalism and conceptualization of films, and at the same time, it rashly negated some scripts that were originally available. Of course, from the perspective of film artists, the lack of close friends among workers, peasants, and soldiers, and therefore the lack of deep understanding and experience of the lives, struggles, thoughts, and emotions of the people, and the lack of sufficient artistic expression ability, are also the fundamental reasons for the formalism and conceptualization of works. The opinion of the vast majority of people in this discussion is not to abolish leadership, but to ask for better leadership, which is worth our deep thought. What artists ask for is not only a decision to pass or deny, not only good or bad comments, but also a detailed analysis of their works and cordial, comradely suggestions and criticisms. The above-mentioned subjectivist approach and the simplistic and crude attitude towards artistic creation have bound and hindered the free creation of artists for a period of time. Therefore, improving the methods of artistic leadership, respecting the creative labor of artists, and establishing a close friendship between leaders and artists that is conducive to artistic creation are important links in improving film work.
    The reasons for the above-mentioned shortcomings and errors are, on the one hand, that we still lack experience in managing film, a complex and important national undertaking that includes art, science, technology, and economics; on the other hand, more importantly, it lies in the dogmatism and sectarianism in the leadership. Dogmatism is mainly manifested in the fact that we often do not fully consider the characteristics of film art when formulating plans for the development of the film industry and various rules and regulations for film work, and when stipulating film theme selection plans and reviewing each specific work; we do not fully consider China's actual situation and specific conditions, and dogmatism is always combined with sectarianism. Our film industry has a large team gathered from all sides. From this discussion, it is not difficult to see that there are still varying degrees of estrangement between the Party and non-Party members, between new cadres and old cadres, and between administrative workers and artists in this team. There are many reasons for this estrangement, the most important of which is the sectarian emotions of some leading cadres. They lack understanding of the progressive films before liberation, underestimate the role of experienced film artists and their ideological progress in recent years, so they have not fully exerted their strength, and some people have been idle for a long time, feeling great depression in both politics and art. In addition, the ideological remolding work of film workers lacks the desire to unite, criticize, and unite, and is accustomed to using "leftist" words or rude accusations to replace patient and meticulous persuasion work. For comrades who have made mistakes in history and work, they are not good at analyzing the historical reasons for the mistakes from an ideological perspective, and use the spirit of treating diseases and saving people to enable more people to learn from the mistakes. This dogmatic and sectarian style has greatly hindered the unity and cooperation of film workers and caused losses in their work.
    The reason why dogmatism and sectarianism arise, in addition to the reasons in thinking methods, there is also an important reason, that is, in the early days of liberation, our film achieved remarkable results, and thus pride and complacency grew in the minds of some film leaders. They adopted an arrogant and exclusive attitude towards some experienced non-Party film workers. In this way, the relationship between leaders and the masses, between the Party and non-Party members became abnormal. In the past two or three years, this situation has been improved to some extent, but because some film leaders stick to conventions and have not been able to change in a timely manner some leadership methods and systems that have been inherited from the past and are no longer suitable today, and more importantly, we have not been able to systematically and thoroughly liquidate dogmatism and sectarianism ideologically. Therefore, resolutely overcoming dogmatism and sectarianism, and implementing the Party's policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" and the policy of "unity, criticism, and unity" in film work has become an extremely important task.
    II In this discussion, a question of how to view the tradition of Chinese films was also raised. Because the views on past films are not clear, it not only affects us to correctly accept the useful experience of the past, but also affects the unity of past film workers. Therefore, we must have a correct understanding of the tradition of Chinese films.
    It has not been 40 years since the Chinese people made their own feature films. In the early days, it was mainly influenced by "Civilized New Drama" (that is, the current popular drama) and martial arts and love novels. After the establishment of Lianhua Company, Chinese films began to be influenced by the "May Fourth" New Literature and Art Trend of Thought. Communists participated in film activities after the "January 28th" War in 1932. By 1933, a progressive force in the film industry, including major film directors, actors, artists, musicians, and film critics, was formed, and the banner of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism was clearly erected. In the early 1930s, the Chinese progressive film based in Shanghai had a leap in development. According to the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal political tasks during the democratic revolution, it produced many films with patriotism, democratic ideas, and socialist ideas, and resolutely fought against feudal ideas and comprador bourgeois ideas. We cannot and will not forget that as early as more than 20 years ago, Chinese progressive film workers had already produced excellent films such as "The Highway", "Song of the Fishermen", and "The Torches" under extremely difficult circumstances. These films served the revolutionary tasks at that time and played a huge role in educating and encouraging the people. It should be admitted that, within the world at that time, Chinese progressive films were standing in the ranks of the advanced.
    However, at the same time, we should also point out the limitations of the Chinese progressive films in this historical stage due to historical and social conditions. Film, as a new art form, is on the one hand a collective labor including art and technology, and on the other hand a business that requires a large amount of economic power to operate. Chinese films grew up in the specific environment of Shanghai in old China, and were inevitably restricted by historical and social conditions. During this period, the vast majority of Chinese film industry was controlled by bureaucratic comprador capitalists, film merchants, and speculators. Everyone can also remember that after the failure of the Great Revolution in 1927, Shanghai was the center of rampant white terror of the Kuomintang. After 1930, progressive films became the object of joint "encirclement and suppression" by internal and external reactionaries. The production and distribution of a film had to go through three or four levels of inspection and deletion, and it was extremely difficult for film artists to truthfully reflect the struggles and lives of the people. In addition, in addition to these external pressures and restrictions, the film artists' own thoughts, lives, and creative methods were inevitably restricted by historical conditions. They were advanced elements of the Chinese intellectual circles, and they were more or less educated and influenced by democratic and socialist ideas. However, because they had been in a semi-feudal and semi-colonial society for a long time and were restricted by the reactionary rule, they had no opportunity to get close to the working people, and their souls inevitably carried the clear imprint of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie. They were worried about the times and indignant, they spoke out for the suffering people, and they tried to use their art to express their ideals for the country and society. However, their thoughts and feelings were still some distance away from the thoughts and feelings of the working people. They participated in the revolutionary literary and art undertaking with enthusiasm, with a sense of "justice", and with sympathy for the oppressed people. At that time, of course, we could not require all progressive film workers to truthfully reflect the struggles and lives of the people from the standpoint of the working class. On the one hand, they accepted the influence of socialist ideas and young Soviet films (Chinese films began to have formal film scripts and photography scripts after the introduction of the theories and works of Soviet film masters Pudovkin, Eisenstein, and Rom to China after 1930), on the other hand, they were also influenced by poisonous American films and bourgeois literary and art ideas, especially vulgar petty-bourgeois tastes, so that films like "The Life of Wu Xun" were produced after liberation. Here, we want to explain again that the mistake of "The Life of Wu Xun" was not Sun Yu's alone. Some communists who were engaged in film leadership work at that time should bear the main responsibility for the production and distribution of this film. This incident can illustrate that not only some non-Party progressive film artists, but also some Party film workers, still retained some bourgeois and petty-bourgeois viewpoints in their thinking. Therefore, in terms of politics, the progressive films in Shanghai were anti-imperialist and anti-feudal. But from the perspective of ideology, there was a distinction between Marxism and non-Marxism within the progressive film industry in Shanghai. Some good films were Marxist in ideology, and some bad films, like "The Life of Wu Xun", were bourgeois in ideology, that is, anti-Marxist. But, despite this, Chinese progressive films are like new seedlings that break through layers of tiles and stones under severe cold weather. Through the research and exploration of progressive film workers, and in the practice of using this new art form and in filmmaking work, they have indeed accumulated a lot of experience that is suitable for China's conditions and worthy of our inheritance. We should correctly and appropriately evaluate the past, we should well accept the experience accumulated by experienced film workers in artistic practice, inherit their fighting tradition, and learn their hard and simple style.
    Therefore, we should adopt an analytical attitude towards the question of how to treat the tradition of Chinese films. First of all, it must be distinguished: before liberation, there were progressive and revolutionary films, and there were also more backward and reactionary films. Among the progressive films, there were Marxist and non-Marxist films. We must inherit all the excellent and progressive traditions of our films, and at the same time correctly and appropriately criticize its shortcomings and errors. Denying or belittling this tradition is undoubtedly wrong. However, we should look forward more than we look back, and we should analyze and choose the past experience and heritage with new viewpoints, and we should critically take and discard them. Therefore, it is undoubtedly wrong to think that everything in the past was good and to demand that the current films return to the old road of the past.
    III Strengthening unity and improving leadership methods are the keys to improving film work. As mentioned earlier, sectarian emotions still exist in some film work cadres, especially in some leading cadres. This sectarianism hinders the unity among film workers, restricts the artistic practice of many film workers, and suppresses their enthusiasm and creativity. This phenomenon has caused serious losses to the film industry and has not been completely changed to this day. Even in this discussion, we can still see some narrow opinions with sectarian emotions, that is, they do not have a deep understanding of the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend", they do not sufficiently estimate the progress of the vast number of intellectuals and art workers in recent years, they lack confidence in the social forces that supervise and guide our art undertakings, and therefore they are concerned about free competition and free debate in literary and art work, fearing that after changing the organizational form and leadership method of film art creation, there will be "poisonous weeds" and bad or even harmful films will be produced. They are full of doubts, and they are hesitant and afraid to boldly exert everyone's enthusiasm. At the same time, they do not have a deep understanding of the shortcomings and errors in their work, so they cannot humbly accept various criticisms. Some people also seem a little impatient with some one-sided views that have appeared in the discussion and lack a patient attitude of persuasion. Obviously, this is also not conducive to the further unity of film workers.
    It must be recognized that, after learning and ideological remolding, and experiencing various social reform movements, the vast majority of Chinese film workers have basically established the idea of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving socialist construction. Therefore, the unity of film workers has a reliable foundation. On this basis, film workers should be allowed to boldly exert their artistic talents and create their own unique artistic styles according to their own conditions and using the creative methods they are familiar with and like. The leaders of film work should have full estimation and trust in their artistic talents and give them various necessary and possible help. New and old film work cadres should also respect each other, help each other, and learn from each other. The sectarian style of not trusting and respecting some old film artists enough in the past must be completely corrected. It should be seen that these old film artists have not only made great progress in their thinking, but also have many valuable artistic experiences. The leading personnel of film work and young film workers should humbly learn from them and should never exclude them. At the same time, old film artists should also constantly improve their ideological and artistic level and enthusiastically help and train young film workers. Only in this way can we do a good job in unity and can we advance our film industry.
    To improve leadership methods, the most fundamental thing is to overcome dogmatism, sectarianism, and bureaucracy, lead film work according to the characteristics of film art production, give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of film art workers, and rely on them to carry out work. In this way, the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" can be implemented in the film industry.
    In socialist society, the exploiting classes have been eliminated. People from exploiting classes are being transformed into laborers. If film art wants to reflect reality, it will inevitably have to write more about the themes of working people. Because modern themes, apart from the lives of working people, are becoming less and less. Our films must unswervingly serve the working people, so they will inevitably have to write about the themes of working people, but this must not be understood as films can only express the themes of workers, peasants, and soldiers. The themes of films should be very broad and should reflect our rich and colorful social life from all aspects to meet the diverse requirements of the audience. We should help film workers to become familiar with and express the lives and struggles of the working people, and at the same time, we should allow and encourage them to freely choose the creative themes they are willing to describe and give full play to the talents and enthusiasm of all film workers. Our film production should strive to increase the quantity of products and gradually improve the quality on the basis of ensuring a certain quantity.
    In terms of production management, we should implement the method of combining centralized leadership and decentralized management, combining voluntary integration and overall arrangement. We should change the past practice of over-centralized leadership over the film industry and administrative interference in artistic creation, and hand over the responsibility of artistic creation to the film studios and creative cadres themselves, so as to give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of film creators. At the same time, the state must have centralized leadership in terms of guidelines and policies, development plans for the film industry, national film production plans, and the proportion of themes, so as to ensure that the development of the film industry can meet the interests of socialist construction and educating the people with socialist ideas.
    In terms of business management, we should gradually implement economic accounting, increase production and practice economy, and reduce costs on the premise of ensuring that the film has a certain quality. There are two kinds of "box office value". Films that are ideologically progressive can have a very high box office value, and films that are ideologically extremely bad can also have a very high box office value. It is incorrect to evaluate the film industry based solely on the "box office value" while ignoring the ideological content of the film and its role in society; however, it is also incorrect to oppose the policy of film serving workers, peasants, and soldiers to cost accounting, as if films serving workers, peasants, and soldiers can waste manpower and materials without striving to improve management and reduce costs.
    It should be admitted that the political and ideological level and artistic level of some of our film workers are still not high, especially many young cadres who have just taken up film work and lack experience in film creation. This cannot but be another important reason for the low quality of some films. Without a group of excellent film art cadres with high ideological and artistic level and rich creative experience, it is impossible to produce films with high artistic quality. Therefore, we are faced with a serious task of cultivating and improving film cadres. In addition to helping them with their studies and providing them with various conditions needed for their studies, the most important thing is to make them often contact the working people and often get the opportunity for artistic practice, and to exercise and improve their artistic talents through artistic practice, so that they can quickly master the characteristics of film art. We should not make many people idle. In addition to shooting more films, we should also strengthen the work of film actor troupes or theaters, so that film art workers can often meet the audience not only on the screen but also on the stage. We have a not-so-small film art team, and many film art workers in it are talented. As long as they can be given appropriate and effective help, their works will definitely be able to quickly catch up with the world's advanced artistic and technical level.
    Our film workers must know that film is a tool for educating the people, whether you like it or not, that's the way it is. Film workers must serve a certain class, whether you like it or not, that's the way it is. In socialist society, apart from serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, what other class can film work serve? Therefore, our film workers must strive to transform themselves so that they can serve workers, peasants, and soldiers well. Politically agreeing with socialism does not mean that you are a Marxist ideologically. We must strive to learn Marxism, but it is not enough to just read some books. More importantly, we must go to the working people and make ourselves close friends with workers, peasants, and soldiers. The bourgeois ideas expressed in the films, the formalistic and conceptualized things expressed, are fundamentally due to the fact that our film workers still lack close friends with workers, peasants, and soldiers, are incompatible with workers, peasants, and soldiers, or are aloof, so workers, peasants, and soldiers are unwilling to tell our film workers the truth. To make close friends with workers, peasants, and soldiers requires long-term efforts and cannot be achieved overnight. We must enable more film workers to do this in the long run. This is the fundamental key to improving our film industry ideologically and the fundamental key to realizing further unity in the film industry.
      The victory of the Chinese revolution has unfolded an infinitely broad world in front of our film art workers. Our new life is rich and colorful. We have full freedom to describe various different themes with various different art forms and various different art styles to create works that truthfully reflect this great era and serve the socialist motherland. We believe that as long as our film artists can strengthen unity, humbly learn, constantly improve their ideological and artistic level, go deep into the lives of the people, strive for artistic practice, and sum up successful and failed experiences from practice, and make these experiences and lessons a mirror for future work; at the same time, improve our leadership over film work and implement the Party's policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend", then in the garden of our film art, we will surely be able to open up flowers that compete for beauty, and we will surely be able to create works that truthfully reflect socialist reality and are welcomed by the broad masses of people. We are full of hope and confidence in the progress and development of our cause!

    加强团结，改进电影工作
    夏衍
    去年秋天以来，北京和上海的报刊上展开了关于我国电影问题的热烈的讨论。除去文学艺术工作者、电影工作者之外，广大的电影爱好者也参加了讨论，并发表了许多正确的和有益的意见。这种讨论表明了人民群众对电影事业的真挚的关怀，也表明了我们电影工作中的确还存在着不少错误和缺点。
    几年来，我们的许多影片受到了人民群众的喜爱与欢迎，但是人民群众对一些质量不高、枯燥无味的影片也表示了不满。他们希望能有机会发表意见，提出批评。自从百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针提出以来，电影工作的组织者和创作人员之间，正在探讨改进领导方法和改变艺术创作的组织形式，因此这一讨论就提供了一个集思广益、听取各种不同意见，以便纠正错误和缺点的机会。在这一讨论中，绝大部分是正确的批评、有益的意见，但同时不可避免地也有一些片面的、不正确的看法。有些人看不到解放后我国电影事业的根本的变化和发展，而用虚无主义的态度来否定一切，对文艺为工农兵服务的方针发生动摇；另外一些人则只看见工作的成绩，不愿意正视工作中的缺点和错误，对来自群众的批评采取了不欢迎的、乃至拒绝的态度。显然，这两种态度都是不对的。我们的态度是肯定成绩，坚持电影为工农兵服务的方针，同时，坚决地克服缺点，改正错误。
    这次讨论涉及的范围很广，问题很多。在这篇文章中，我们打算着重地研究一下下面的几个问题：这就是：一、对八年来我国电影的评价；二、对解放以前的我国电影的评价；三、加强电影工作者的团结和改进电影工作的领导。
    在讨论这些问题之前，我们先要明确地解决一个根本性质的问题，这就是电影工作的性质和电影工作在整个革命工作中的位置。对于这个问题，早在1907年列宁就曾指出：“当电影掌握在庸俗的投机者手中的时候，它常常以恶劣的剧本将群众引入堕落之途，它带来的害处多于益处。但是，当群众掌握了电影的时候，并且当它掌握在真正的社会主义文化工作者手中的时候，它就是教育群众的最强有力的工具之一。”电影是通过艺术的形象时时刻刻同千百万群众直接接触的、最富于大众性的艺术，它具有从精神上影响群众的无可比拟的巨大力量。因此，革命的电影工作者的任务，首先就是力图掌握这一犀利的武器，来反映人民群众的要求和愿望，使之服务于革命的政治斗争。毛泽东同志也曾指示过我们：“党的文艺工作，在党的整个革命工作中的位置，是确定了的，摆好了的；是服从党在一定革命时期内所规定的革命任务的。”艺术必须服从政治，艺术必须为革命斗争服务，为劳动群众服务。因此，中国电影在民主革命和社会主义革命这两个阶段的革命中是否服从于所规定的革命的任务，是否反映了广大人民的利益和要求，是我们在检查电影工作的时候，必须首先答复的问题。
    电影为什么人服务，这是一个原则性方针性的问题。我们要坚持和贯彻电影为工农兵服务的方针。可是，在按着这个方针进行工作的时候，接着的还有一个如何去服务和怎样才能服务得更好的问题。由于这样，在这次讨论中我们首先要明确的问题应该是：我国电影的基本道路是否正确，是否服从了革命的利益和人民的利益，是否执行了为工农兵服务的方针；其次，我们还要在沿着这条道路前进的过程中，检查领导工作和艺术创作中的缺点和错误。不从工人阶级的立场来坚持文艺服从政治、电影为工农兵服务的方针，我们的工作就会迷失方向；另一方面，不接受群众的监督和批评，不改正工作中的错误和缺点，那么，正确的方针就不能有效地贯彻，就不能产生出对群众有益而又为群众所欢迎的作品。
    从这个基本态度出发，我们就可以比较容易地接触到这次讨论中首先被提到的八年来我国电影的成就和缺点的问题，和对解放前的我国电影的估价问题。一  中华人民共和国成立以来，我国电影事业获得了划时代的发展和进步。我们不仅在短时期内彻底肃清了帝国主义的反动电影，观众由1949年每年不足五千万人次（主要是城市观众，其中80％以上是美国电影的观众）扩大到1956年的每年十三亿九千万人次（其中城市观众占总数的39％）。从无到有地建立了六千多个电影放映队，组成了全国规模的放映网，更重要的是摄制了许多真实地反映了中国革命和人民生活的、质量较高的故事片，其中如“白毛女”、“钢铁战士”、“董存瑞”等获得了大家一致的好评。此外，还摄制了数以千计的及时反映新中国面貌的新闻片、纪录片，译制了大量具有高度思想性艺术性的苏联和人民民主国家的影片。这样，中国电影史上出现了一个新的局面。这就是我们在很短的时间之内，挤掉了霸占中国电影市场达三十年之久的美国电影，用新型的、健康而富有教育意义的影片，来满足了人民群众文化生活上的要求。
    在这里应该特别着重指出，解放以后摄制的各种影片，由于坚决执行了文艺为工农兵服务的方针，由于绝大多数电影工作者通过学习和自我改造，在思想上艺术上都有了显著的提高，因此，这些影片和解放以前的电影已经有了根本的区别。且不谈解放以前的那些单纯以赢利为目的的、黄色的、低级趣味的电影，就是进步电影，也往往是从革命小资产阶级的立场观点，用迂回曲折、隐蔽讽喻的手法来表达对被压迫人民群众的同情；而今天的人民电影，则明确地站在工人阶级的立场，用鲜明的阶级观点，来真实地描写劳动人民的生活、斗争和愿望。中国电影经历了二、三十年的艰困的路程，从此才走上了康庄大道。中国电影工作者经过了长期的斗争和探索，从此才得到了可以全心全意地为人民服务的机会。中国电影呈现了一个崭新的面貌，这是一个划时代的变革。中国银幕上出现了新的人、新的事、新的思想感情、新的道德标准。中国电影通过银幕告诉人民：人民革命的胜利从何而来，中国革命经过了怎样的道路，经历了多少的困难，以及要怎样才能保障胜利和争取更好的将来。十三亿人次并不是一个小的数字，但是更重要的是这亿万群众通过银幕所受到的感染和教育。新的电影不但给了人们以强烈的革命的思想教育，并且改变了过去许多电影观众的不健康的趣味。在这一点上，我们认为尽管八年来的电影工作还有许多缺点——甚至很严重的缺点，但是它已经踏上了为劳动人民服务的坚实道路，使电影成为教育和鼓舞人民的工具，对社会主义改造和社会主义革命事业作出了巨大的贡献，这是必须予以足够的估计，决不应该抹煞的。如果对于这一基本性质的成就不作充分的估计，把中国电影工作的正确的方向和领导工作中的某些缺点和错误混淆起来，因而对文艺为工农兵服务的方针发生怀疑和动摇，这种看法和想法无疑是片面而有害的。
    “文艺报”评论员在“文艺报”1956年第23期所写的“电影的锣鼓”一文以及同一作者以朱煮竹的笔名在1月4日“文汇报”上发表的“为了前进”一文，就表现了片面性的错误。这位作者用虚无主义的态度来否定新中国建立以来的电影工作的成就，片面地把少数大城市电影院的票房价值当作唯一的“检验问题的标准”，认为解放以来的电影完全糟糕，其原因则是由于“在题材的比重上尽量地描写工农兵”。他不了解解放以前的进步电影和解放以后的人民电影的基本性质上的区别，而要求我们的电影事业“倒退”回去。他甚至怀疑党和政府对电影事业的领导的必要性，认为党和政府对电影事业领导力量愈强大，就愈产生不出好影片。他否定整个电影生产中必要的“选题计划”，把电影艺术人员的思想、业务学习叫做“一年一度的传道”。他以片面性去反对片面性，以宗派主义情绪去反对宗派主义，其结果，不是促进电影工作者的团结，而是加深他们之间的隔阂，不是鼓舞大家起来克服缺点，改进工作，而是散布悲观失望情绪，使人们丧失信心。按照这位评论者的意见，那就只有取消电影为工农兵服务的方针，取消党对于电影工作的领导，让电影倒退到资本主义的道路上去。这显然是十分错误而有害的。
    在这次讨论中，许多电影工作者批评了艺术领导的方式方法，如领导过分集中，审查层次过多，在制片思想上狭隘地理解工农兵方向，机械地规定题材比例，制片计划不切实际，对影片内容要求不适当，以及用许多清规戒律来干涉艺术创作中的细节等等。这些现象是确实存在的。解放以后，我们接收了国民党政府经营的残破不堪的电影厂，后来又对私营电影厂实行了国有化，电影从业人员来自各方，经历不同，思想不同，缺乏互相了解和共同语言，在这种情况下，实行统一集中的领导和对影片的较高一级审查制度是完全必要的。但是领导过分集中和审查层次过多的状况，在情况已经发生变化的时候没有能相应地及时地加以改变，就妨碍和束缚了电影创作人员和各厂领导人员的积极性、主动性。强调电影应为工农劳动人民服务，任何时候都是需要的，正确的。但是电影为工农兵服务不等于电影不应该反映工农兵以外的题材。相反的，党和艺术家团体不止一次号召作家们以更广泛的题材、更丰富的样式，来反映中国人民过去和今天的斗争和生活。群众需要各种题材的影片，需要从今天的斗争和过去的斗争中来认识现实和增长知识。因此，把为工农兵服务狭隘地理解为只能反映工农兵的生活，无疑是错误的。我们的电影有一个时期题材范围特别窄狭，是与某些同志的这种狭隘的看法有关。但是，那种认为电影工作的缺点和电影创作上的概念化公式化倾向，就是由于“在题材的比重上尽量地描写了工农兵”的看法，却是不正确的。事实表明，近几年来摄制的故事片中，以工农兵为题材的并不是太多而还是太少。工农兵的生活是无限丰富的，公式化概念化的倾向也决不是因为写了工农兵的生活。问题在哪里？从领导方面说，这是由于在一个时期内，电影领导上曾经不从现有的艺术、技术人员的实际情况出发，主观地计划和号召要摄制所谓“史诗”式的、“纪念碑”式的、概括整个历史面貌的作品，同时又过急地要求电影反映当前的政治运动，机械地要求电影宣传当前的政策法令；加上在一个时期颇占上风的粗暴的文艺批评的影响之下，艺术领导人员缺乏独立思考能力，常常用生硬的公式教条来衡量艺术作品；这样就一方面助长了电影片的公式化、概念化倾向，与此同时，又轻率地否定了一些本来可用的剧本。当然，从电影艺术工作者方面来说，由于在工农兵中缺少知心朋友，因而对人民群众的生活、斗争、思想、情感缺乏深刻的了解和体会，缺乏足够的艺术表现能力，也是造成作品公式化、概念化的根本原因。这次讨论中绝大多数人的意见并不是不要领导，而是要求有更好的领导，这是值得我们深思的事情。艺术家们要求的不单是通过或者否定的决定，不单是好或者不好的评语，而是希望得到对他们的作品的细致的分析，和亲切的、同志式的建议与批评。上面所说的那种主观主义的做法和对艺术创作的简单化的、粗暴的态度，曾在一个时期之内束缚和阻碍了艺术家们的自由创造，因此，改进艺术领导的方式，尊重艺术家们的创造性的劳动，建立起领导和艺术家们之间的有利于艺术创造的亲密友谊，是改进电影工作的重要环节。
    造成上述这些缺点错误的原因，一方面是由于我们对于管理电影这样一项包含艺术、科学、技术和经济组织的复杂而重大的国家事业还缺乏经验；另一方面，更重要的，是在于领导上存在教条主义和宗派主义作风。教条主义主要表现在我们在制定发展电影事业的规划和电影工作的各种制度规章的时候，在规定影片选题计划和审查每个具体作品的时候，常常没有充分考虑电影艺术的特点；没有充分考虑我国的实际情况和具体条件，而教条主义又总是和宗派主义相结合的。我们的电影事业拥有一支庞大的、从各方面汇合起来的队伍，从这次讨论不难看出，这支队伍中的党与非党之间、新干部与老干部之间、行政工作者与艺术人员之间，都还存在着不同程度的隔阂。造成这种隔阂的原因很多，其中最主要的是一部分领导干部的宗派主义情绪。他们对解放以前的进步电影缺乏认识，对有经验的电影艺术家的作用和几年来他们在思想上的进步估计不足，因此没有充分地发挥他们的力量，有些人被长期闲置，在政治上和艺术上都感到极大的苦闷。加上，在电影工作者的思想改造工作中缺乏从团结出发、经过批评达到团结的愿望，惯于用“左”的词句或者粗暴的指责来代替耐心细致的说服工作，对历史上和工作中犯过错误的同志，不善于从思想上分析错误的历史原因，本治病救人的精神来使更多的人从错误中得到教训。这种教条主义、宗派主义的作风，大大地妨碍了电影工作者的团结和合作，造成了工作中的损失。
    教条主义、宗派主义之所以产生，除了思想方法上的原因以外，还有一个重要原因，就是解放初期，我们的电影获得了显著的成绩，因而在某些电影领导工作者的头脑中就滋长了骄傲自满的情绪。他们对一些有经验的非党的电影工作者采取了傲漫的、排斥的态度。这样，领导与群众，党和非党之间的关系就出现了不正常的状态。近两三年来，这种状态虽已有所改善，但是由于一部分电影领导干部墨守成规，对于过去承袭下来而在今天已经不合适了的一些领导方法和制度，还没有能够及时地加以改变，而更重要的是我们对教条主义、宗派主义还没有能够系统地、彻底地从思想上加以清算。因此，坚决克服教条主义、宗派主义，在电影工作中贯彻执行党的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”和“团结、批评、团结”的方针，就成为一项极其重要的任务。二 在这次讨论中，还提出了一个如何看待我国电影的传统问题。由于对过去的电影看法不明确，不但影响我们去正确地接受过去的有用的经验，而且影响到对于过去的电影工作人员的团结。因此，对于中国电影的传统问题，我们必须有一个正确的认识。
    中国人自己摄制故事影片，还不足四十年的历史。在初期，它受到的主要是“文明新戏”（即现在的通俗话剧）和武侠、言情小说的影响。联华公司成立之后，中国电影开始受到“五四”新文艺思潮的影响。共产主义者参加电影活动，开始于1932年的“一二八”战争之后。到1933年，才组成了一支包括主要的电影导演、演员、美术家、音乐家、影评家在内的电影界的进步力量，才鲜明地树立起了反帝反封建的旗帜。在三十年代初期，以上海为基地的中国进步电影有了飞跃的发展，它根据民主革命时期的反帝反封建的政治任务，摄制了许多具有爱国主义精神、民主思想和社会主义思想的影片，并和封建思想、买办资产阶级思想进行了坚决的斗争。我们不能也不会忘记，早在二十几年之前，中国进步的电影工作者在极度困难的环境之下，已经摄成了像“大路”、“渔光曲”、“桃李劫”这样的优秀影片。这些影片服务于当时的革命任务，对人民群众起了巨大的教育、鼓舞作用。应该承认，在当时的世界范围内，中国进步电影是站在先进的行列中的。
    但是同时，我们也应该指出的中国进步电影在这一历史阶段所受到的历史条件和社会条件的限制。电影这种新的艺术形式，一方面是包括艺术和技术的集体性的劳动，同时又是一种需要有大量经济力量来经营的企业。中国电影在旧中国的上海这一特定的环境中成长起来，不可避免地要受到历史和社会条件的限制。在这时期，中国电影事业绝大部分掌握在官僚买办资本家、影片商和投机商人的手中。大家也都能够记得，1927年大革命失败以后，上海是国民党白色恐怖肆虐的中心，1930年之后，进步电影又成了内外反动派联合“围剿”的对象，摄制和发行一部影片必须经过三重四重的检查和删剪，电影艺术家要真实地反映人民群众的斗争和生活是一件极其困难的事情。加上，除了这些外在的压力和限制之外，在电影艺术家们自己的思想、生活、创作方法上也还不可避免地受着历史条件的限制。他们是中国知识界的先进分子，他们或多或少地都受到过民主思想和社会主义思想的教育影响。但是，由于他们长期处身在半封建半殖民地的社会，和受着反动统治的种种限制，他们没有和劳动人民接近的机会，他们的灵魂深处也不可免地带着资产阶级、小资产阶级的鲜明烙印。他们忧时愤世，他们为苦难的人民鸣不平，他们力求用他们的艺术来吐露他们对国家对社会的理想。可是，他们的思想感情究竟同劳动人民的思想感情还有一定的距离。他们是凭热情、凭“正义感”、凭对被压迫人民的同情来参加革命的文艺事业的。在当时，我们当然不能要求所有的进步电影工作者都能从工人阶级的立场来真实地反映人民群众的斗争和生活。他们一方面接受了社会主义思想和年轻的苏联电影的影响（中国电影在1930年以后，苏联电影大师普多夫金、爱森斯坦、罗姆等人的理论和作品介绍到中国来之后，才开始有了正规的电影剧本和摄影台本），另一方面也受到有毒素的美国电影和资产阶级文艺思想、特别是庸俗的小市民趣味的影响，以致在解放以后还产生了像“武训传”这样的影片。在这里，我们要再一次说明，“武训传”的错误不是孙瑜先生一个人的，当时的一些担任电影领导工作的共产党员，对于这部影片的摄制和发行应负主要的责任。由这件事可以说明，不但一些非党的进步的电影艺术家，就是有些党员电影工作者，在思想上也还是保留了若干资产阶级、小资产阶级的观点。因此，在政治方面来说，上海的进步电影是反帝反封建的。但是从思想方面来说，上海的进步电影事业的内部却有马克思主义与非马克思主义之分。一些好的影片，在思想上是马克思主义的，一些坏的影片，像“武训传”，在思想上是资产阶级的，即反马克思主义的。但是，尽管如此，中国进步电影有如在严寒的气候下突破层层的瓦石重压而生长出来的新苗，经过进步的电影工作者的钻研摸索，在运用这种新的艺术形式和在制片工作的实践中，也确曾积累了不少值得我们继承的适合于中国情况的经验。我们应该正确地恰如其分地估价过去，我们要很好地接受有经验的电影工作者们在艺术实践中积累下来的经验，继承他们的战斗传统，学习他们艰苦朴质的作风。
    因此，如何对待中国电影的传统问题，我们应当采取分析的态度。首先必须区别：在解放以前有进步的、革命的电影，也有更大量的落后的，反动的电影，在进步电影中，又有马克思主义的和非马克思主义的之分。我们必须继承我国电影中一切优良的、进步的传统，同时要正确地恰如其分地批评它的缺点和错误。否认或轻视这种传统，无疑是错误的。但是，要顾后更要瞻前，我们接受过去的经验和遗产应该用新的观点来分析和抉择，应该有批判地加以取舍。因此，认为过去的一切都好，要求现在的电影再回到过去的老路，这种观点无疑是错误的。 三 加强团结，改善领导方法，是改进电影工作的关键。如前面所说，在一部分电影工作干部，特别是某些领导干部中，还存在着宗派主义情绪。这种宗派主义，妨碍了电影工作者之间的团结，限制了许多电影工作者的艺术实践，压抑了他们的积极性和创造性。这种现象，给电影事业造成严重损失，并且直到今天还没有彻底改变。就在这次讨论中，也还看到一些狭隘的带宗派情绪的意见，这就是对“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针理解不深，对近年以来广大知识分子、艺术工作者的进步估计不足，对监督和引导我们艺术事业的社会力量缺乏信心，因而对文艺工作的自由竞赛、自由辩论心存顾虑，深怕在改变了电影艺术创作的组织形式和领导方式之后，会出现“毒草”，会产生出不好的以至有害的影片，他们疑虑重重，束手束脚，不敢大胆发挥大家的积极性。同时，对于工作中的缺点和错误认识不深，因此，不能虚心接受各种批评意见。也有一部分人对讨论中出现的某些片面的看法，显得有些急躁，缺乏耐心说服的态度。显然这也是不利于电影工作者的进一步团结的。
    必须认识，我国电影工作者经过了学习和思想改造，经历了各种社会改革运动，绝大多数已经基本上树立了为工农兵服务、为社会主义建设服务的思想，因此，电影工作者的团结已经有了可靠的基础。在这个基础上，应该让电影工作者根据他们自己的条件，采用他们所熟悉和喜欢的创作方法，大胆地发挥他们的艺术才能，创造自己独特的艺术风格。电影工作的领导者应该对他们的艺术才能有充分的估计和信任，并且给他们以各种必要的和可能的帮助。新的和老的电影工作干部也应该互相尊重，互相帮助，互相学习。过去对于一些老的电影艺术家不够信任和尊重的宗派主义作风必须彻底纠正。应该看到，这些老的电影艺术家不但思想上有了很大的进步，并且他们具有许多宝贵的艺术经验，电影工作的领导人员和年青的电影工作者都应当虚心地向他们学习，而决不应该排斥他们。同时，老的电影艺术家也应该不断提高自己的思想、艺术水平，热心帮助和培养年青的电影工作者。只有这样，才能搞好团结，才能把我们的电影事业向前推进。
    要改进领导方法，最根本的就是必须克服教条主义、宗派主义和官僚主义，按照电影艺术生产的特点去领导电影工作，充分发挥电影艺术工作者的积极性和创造性，依靠他们去进行工作。这样，“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针才能在电影事业中得到贯彻。
    在社会主义社会里，剥削阶级消灭了。从剥削阶级出身的人，正在被改造成为劳动者。电影艺术如果要反映现实，势必要多写劳动人民的题材。因为现代的题材，除了劳动人民的生活以外，其他就越来越少了。我们的电影必须始终不渝地为劳动人民服务，因此就必然的要写劳动人民的题材，但是，这决不能被了解为电影只能表现工农兵的题材。电影的题材应该十分广泛，应该从各方面来反映我们的丰富多采的社会生活，以满足观众的多方面的要求。我们应该帮助电影工作者去熟悉和表现劳动人民的生活和斗争，同时又应该允许并鼓励他们自由地选择他们所愿意描写的创作题材，发挥一切电影工作者的才能和积极性。我们的电影生产，应努力增加出品数量，在保证一定数量的基础上逐步提高质量。
    在生产管理方面，应该实行集中领导和分散经营相结合、自愿结合和统筹安排相结合的办法。应该改变过去的对电影事业过分集中的领导和艺术创作上的行政干涉的作法，将艺术创作的责任交给制片厂和创作干部自己去担负，以发挥电影创作人员的积极性和创造性。同时，在方针政策、电影事业发展规划、全国制片计划和题材比例等方面，必须有国家的集中领导，以保证电影事业的发展能够符合社会主义建设和用社会主义思想教育人民的利益。
    在经营管理方面，要在保证影片具有一定质量的条件下，逐步地实行经济核算，增产节约，降低成本。“票房价值”有两种，思想上进步的影片可以有很高的票房价值，思想上极其恶劣的影片也可以有很高的票房价值。那种忽视影片的思想内容和它在社会上所起的作用，只根据单纯的“票房价值”去评价电影事业的观点是不正确的；但是把影片为工农兵服务的方针与成本核算对立起来，好像为工农兵服务的电影可以浪费人力物力，而不努力改善经营，降低成本，这种观点也是不正确的。
    应该承认，我们有些电影工作人员的政治思想水平和艺术水平还是不高，特别是许多新走上电影工作岗位的青年干部，还缺乏电影创作的经验，这不能不是有些影片质量不高的另一个重要原因。没有一批优秀的具有较高的思想、艺术水平又有丰富的创作经验的电影艺术干部，是不可能产生出具有高度的艺术质量的影片的。因此，在我们面前就摆着一个培养和提高电影干部的严重任务。除了帮助他们进行学习，给他们解决学习上所需要的各种条件以外，最重要的是使他们经常和劳动人民接触，经常获得艺术实践的机会，通过艺术实践来锻炼和提高他们的艺术才能，使他们很快地掌握电影艺术的特性。我们不应该使许多人闲置起来，除了要拍摄更多的影片以外，还要加强电影演员剧团或者剧院的工作，使电影艺术工作者不仅在银幕上，并且在舞台上能够经常与观众见面。我们有一个不算太小的电影艺术队伍，其中许许多多电影艺术工作者都是有才能的，只要能给他们以适当的有效的帮助，他们的作品一定能够很快地赶上世界先进的艺术水平和技术水平。
    我们的电影工作者必须知道，电影是教育人民的工具，不管你愿意或者不愿意，事情总是这样的。电影工作者必须为一定的阶级服务，不管你愿意或者不愿意，事情总是这样的。在社会主义社会里，电影工作除了为工农兵服务以外，难道还能为别的什么阶级服务么？因此，我们的电影工作者，必须自己奋勉，努力改造自己，使自己能够很好地为工农兵服务。政治上赞成社会主义，并不等于思想上是个马克思主义者。我们要努力学习马克思主义，但光光读些书本是不够的。更重要的，是必须到劳动人民中去，使自己有工农兵的知心朋友。影片中表现出来的资产阶级思想，表现出来的公式化、概念化的东西，其根本原因，就是我们的电影工作者还缺少工农兵的知心朋友，同工农兵格格不入，或者若即若离，因而工农兵也不肯把真心话告诉我们的电影工作者。要在工农兵中结交知心朋友，这需要长期的努力，不是一蹴而致的。我们要在长时期内，使电影工作者能有比较更多的人做到这一点。这是把我们的电影事业在思想上提高一步的根本关键，也是电影界实现进一步的团结的根本关键。
      中国革命的胜利，在我们电影艺术工作者面前已经展开了无限宽广的天地。我们的新生活丰富多采，我们有充分的自由，可以用各种不同的艺术形式、各种不同的艺术风格，描写各种不同的题材，来创造真实地反映出这个伟大时代的、为社会主义祖国服务的作品。我们相信，只要我们电影艺术家们能够加强团结，虚心学习，不断地提高思想艺术水平，深入人民生活，努力艺术实践，并从实践中总结成功的和失败的经验，使这些经验教训成为今后工作的借镜；同时改进我们对电影工作的领导，贯彻执行党的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，那么在我们电影艺术的园地中一定能开放出争奇竞艳的鲜花，一定能创造出真实地反映出社会主义现实、而又为广大人民群众所欢迎的作品。对于我们的事业的前进和发展，我们是充满了希望和信心的！
