Xinhua News Agency, April 4th: Fu Qiutao, Secretary-General of the Central Transfer and Construction Committee, told Xinhua News Agency reporters today: In accordance with the principle of reducing military and administrative expenditures and concentrating all forces to strengthen economic construction, the number of demobilized soldiers in the Chinese People's Liberation Army this year will greatly exceed the number of conscripted soldiers.

Fu Qiutao said: The political quality of this year's demobilized soldiers is relatively high. They all voluntarily joined the army before 1953 and generally have four or five years of military service, with some having more than seven years. Among them, Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members account for about 90%, and non-commissioned officers also account for 90%. Many of them have been tempered by the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and have participated in battles to liberate coastal islands and defend coastal and border defenses, contributing their greatest strength to defending the motherland. Many of them have been awarded several merits and have won titles such as "Socialist Construction Activist," "Work Model," and other honorary titles. Among the demobilized soldiers, heroes and model figures generally account for about 30%. In a certain army unit, it even accounts for 54.3%. Most of these veteran soldiers are young and strong, with an average age of about 25, have a considerable elementary school education level or higher, and about one-fifth of them possess professional skills. They are very enthusiastic about participating in the construction of the motherland and will bring the glorious tradition and fine style of the People's Liberation Army to their production posts.

Fu Qiutao said: Most of the soldiers demobilized this year will return to the countryside to participate in agricultural production and jointly build the motherland's socialist new countryside. Those with technical skills will gradually participate in industrial and mining enterprises based on the needs of the country's factories and mines. Because these veteran soldiers have served in the army for a long time, they have gradually become unfamiliar with production techniques, and they may encounter some difficulties in family life at the beginning. Therefore, it is hoped that governments at all levels and the people of various regions, while warmly welcoming their relatives and comrades-in-arms to return home with honor, should properly help them start families and careers, manage their households diligently and frugally, use the production subsidies they bring back for production, and enable them to give full play to their active role on the production front and make greater contributions to the country.

    傅秋涛谈今年复员军人情况
    新华社4日讯　中央转业建设委员会秘书长傅秋涛今天对新华社记者说：中国人民解放军根据国家缩减军政费用、集中一切力量加强经济建设的方针，今年复员的人数将大大超过征集的人数。
    傅秋涛说：今年复员军人的政治质量比较高。他们全部是1953年以前志愿参军入伍的，一般都有四、五年军龄，有的军龄在七年以上。其中共产党员、青年团员占90％左右，军士也占90％。他们很多人经过抗美援朝战争的锻炼和参加过解放沿海岛屿和保卫海防、边防的斗争，为保卫祖国贡献了自己最大的力量。他们许多人立过几次功，获得社会主义建设积极分子、工作模范和其他荣誉称号。复员军人中，功臣、模范人物一般约占30％左右。陆军某部甚至占54.3％。这批复员军人大多年轻力壮，平均年龄在二十五岁左右，有相当小学以上的文化水平，并且约有五分之一的人具有专业技术。他们参加祖国建设事业的热情很高，将把人民解放军的光荣传统和优良作风带到生产岗位上去。
    傅秋涛说：今年复员的战士，大部分将回到农村参加农业生产，共同建设祖国社会主义的新农村。有技术的人员，根据国家厂矿企业用人情况，也将会逐渐地参加到工矿企业中去。由于这些老战士在军队服务时间较长，对生产技术已渐渐生疏，在家庭生活中开始也会遇到些困难。因此，希望各级政府和各地人民在热情欢迎自己的亲人和战友光荣归来的同时，应当妥善地帮助他们成家立业，勤俭持家，把带回的生产资助金用到生产上去，并且使他们在生产战线上充分发挥积极作用，为国家作出更大的贡献。
