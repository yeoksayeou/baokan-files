    Bean Cake Can Extinguish Fires
    Shanghai held a petroleum fire extinguishing drill on March 30th.

    On a plaza in the suburbs of Shanghai, drill personnel used a fire torch to touch a ten-foot diameter oil pan containing fifty gallons of oil. The fire quickly ignited. A minute later, a mechanism in a fixed installation next to the oil pan continuously sprayed lemon-colored foam. The thick stream of foam moved forward like a blanket, covering and extinguishing the flames. It took only forty-six seconds to extinguish this fire and smoke that reached a height of ten zhang.

    This air foam liquid is made from protein extracted from bean cake. It was successfully tested by the Shanghai Zhendan Machine Iron Factory, a joint state-private enterprise, over a period of more than a year. According to a report from the factory on the achievements of trial-producing the air foam liquid: this air foam liquid has a low cost, is non-toxic, non-corrosive, and odorless. One kilogram of bean cake can extract 1.216 liters of foam liquid, and most of the remaining material after extraction can still be used as feed or fertilizer. This air foam liquid has the same fire extinguishing effect for various oil depots, oil tankers, paint factories, rubber factories, and even airport oil storage fires. If used to extinguish ordinary fires in cities and villages, the effect will be even faster.

    豆饼可以灭火
    上海市在3月30日举行了一次扑灭石油起火的演习。
    在上海市郊广场上，演习人员用火捧在一个直径十英呎、储油五十加仑的油盘中一触，火就很快地燃烧起来。过了一分钟，油盘旁边一个固定装置的机件中，不停地喷出柠檬色的泡沫。厚厚的沫流像一条毡毯一样，向前移动着盖灭火舌，只花了四十六秒钟就把这股高达十丈的烟火扑灭了。
    这种空气泡沫液是用从豆饼中提炼出来的蛋白质制成的。它是公私合营上海震旦机器铁工厂经过一年多的时间试验成功的。据该厂一份试制空气泡沫液成就的情况报告书称：这种空气泡沫液成本低，无毒，无腐蚀性，无臭味。一公斤豆饼中可以提炼一点二一六公升泡沫液，提炼后的剩余物质很大部分仍旧能作饲料或肥料。这种空气泡沫液对各种油库、油船以及漆厂、橡胶厂，甚至飞机场储油起火，都有同等灭火功效，如果用于扑灭城市、乡村的普通火灾，收效更速。
