Xinhua News Agency, Huaiyin, 24th -- Farmers in the Huaiyin Special District, Jiangsu Province, are currently speeding up the construction of large-scale flood prevention farmland water conservancy projects and selectively converting dry land into paddy fields, after completing the spring sowing of over five million mu of corn and sorghum. This is an important measure in the plan to change the impoverished face of the Huaiyin Special District within three to five years.

Since the beginning of spring, 400,000 laborers in the Huaiyin Special District have participated in the construction of farmland water conservancy projects. They have dug the Tanggou New River and Huaisi Drainage River in Siyang, Huaiyin, and Shuyang counties. It is estimated that these projects will be completed before the wheat harvest this year, which can improve the drainage conditions of 3.18 million mu of farmland and increase grain production by more than 150 million jin. This year, the entire special district plans to selectively convert more than 480,000 mu of dry land into paddy fields and plant rice.

    淮阴专区农民加紧修水利
    据新华社淮阴24日电　江苏省淮阴专区农民在完成五百多万亩玉米和高粱的春播任务之后，目前正在加紧兴修大面积防涝的农田水利工程和有重点地改旱地为水田。这是在三五年内改变淮阴专区贫困面貌的规划中的重要措施。
    入春以来，淮阴专区有四十万民工参加兴修农田水利工程。他们在泗阳、淮阴、沭阳三县开挖了塘沟新河和淮泗排水河。预计这些工程在今年麦收前完成，可以使三百一十八万亩田地改善排涝状况，增产粮食一亿五千多万斤。今年全专区计划有重点地把四十八万多亩旱地改成水田，种上水稻。
