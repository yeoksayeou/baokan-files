    This newspaper dispatch: Since Comrade Mao Zedong delivered speeches at the Supreme State Council and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's Propaganda Work Conference, the intellectual circles across the country have furthered their understanding of the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy. Literary journals are important platforms for realizing this policy, and editorial departments have launched heated discussions on how to implement this policy and have raised many questions. The Secretariat of the Chinese Writers Association convened the first meeting of the Beijing Literary and Art Journals Editors Symposium on April 20th, attended by Mao Dun, Zhou Yang, Lao She, Shao Quanlin, and the main staff of the editorial departments of publications such as "People's Literature" and "Literary Gazette." Mao Dun and others spoke at the meeting.

    Anti-"Left" and Anti-Right, What is the Focus?

    According to the Party's policy, the editorial departments of the journals realized that a struggle between two lines, opposing "Left" dogmatism and right-leaning opportunism, should be carried out on the ideological front. However, they hoped to further understand what the main thrust of the criticism should target. Comrades like Mao Dun all expressed in their speeches that, according to the current situation, the main thing is to overcome dogmatism and sectarianism. Because currently, there are various concerns about the criticism of dogmatism, such as: dogmatism is often related to certain "leading thoughts"; many people cannot clearly distinguish between dogmatism and Marxism; many people lack sufficient Marxist cultivation to criticize dogmatism; if dogmatism is not overcome, bourgeois ideology cannot be criticized. Zhou Yang pointed out that our thinking often lags behind the development of the situation, and some comrades have a distance or even conflict in their thinking with the spirit of the central policy. Quanlin pointed out that the nation's literary editors are paying attention to the trends of Beijing's literary journals, and these journals must fully embody the policy of "letting go" and "contending."

    Letting Go Big? Letting Go Small? Letting Fragrant Flowers and Poisonous Weeds Bloom Together?

    Some editorial departments are afraid of releasing poisonous weeds, afraid of being "rectified" and writing self-criticisms after releasing poisonous weeds; some are afraid that it will be difficult to criticize after poisonous weeds are released, because it is difficult to guarantee that there will be no dogmatism in the criticism. And this kind of timidity, the inability to publish manuscripts: poisonous weeds dare not be released, dogmatism dare not be touched, fragrant flowers are not easy to obtain, has already been questioned by people: "Has your editorial department thawed?" "The editorial department is like the maiden in the west chamber, with the door half open to the wind." Zhou Yang said, don't be afraid of poisonous weeds. Poisonous weeds are an objective reality, which cannot be avoided. Putting forward the slogan of "avoiding poisonous weeds" is subjectivism. Moreover, fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds are often not easy to distinguish clearly in a period of time, often there is poison in the fragrance, fragrance in the poison, or seemingly poisonous but not poisonous. Proposing to avoid poisonous weeds is actually still unwilling to let go in a big way, demanding that only fragrant flowers be released, which is impossible. Mao Dun said that requiring to identify fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds before releasing them is "opening the door halfway," not "opening the door wide," "I think it's better to open it wide first." Zhou Yang also said that now is not the time to let go small, but to let go big, and even less to collect. It is necessary to let fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds bloom together. Letting poisonous weeds come out has advantages, on the one hand, to let everyone know about poisonous weeds, on the other hand, to make fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds compete, and to conduct persuasive criticism of poisonous weeds. Not criticizing is right-leaning; criticism is not equal to collecting, and it is definitely not "encirclement and suppression."

    Lao She also believes that poisonous weeds can be released, but things that promote obscenity and theft cannot be released, which are poisonous snakes. While opposing pornographic and low-taste literature and art, attention should be paid to distinguishing them from literature and art that depicts love. He said that there is now a "Puritanical" atmosphere, such as considering ballet as pornography. "Beauty" and "yellow" cannot be confused.

    Some journals proposed "standing firm before letting go," Quanlin said that one can only stand firm in the process of "letting go" and "contending," one cannot wait until one stands firm before letting go.

    The Problem of One-Sidedness and Comprehensiveness

    Lao She said that many one-sidedness can be combined into comprehensiveness. Requiring comprehensiveness immediately may not be possible for a while. A comprehensive understanding of things needs to be obtained through gradual practice. We should cultivate democratic life. The democratic method is that many one-sidedness make up comprehensiveness. The current discussion about essays aroused his interest. He said that some people, after reading essays criticizing their line, become annoyed, saying that essays have one-sidedness. In fact, no line can be entirely good. This annoyance shows a lack of the spirit of democratic life. Quanlin believes that we should strive for comprehensiveness. Having one-sidedness and making mistakes is nothing great. Don't make the criticism of mistakes too tense, and contradictions should be fully exposed.

    Opposing Sectarianism

    There are still gaps or tense states between some Party and non-Party intellectuals. Some people say that there seems to be a wall. Zhou Yang believes that this is the fault of sectarianism in some Party member intellectuals. There should be a distinction between Party and non-Party, but there should be no wall. Party members should work more and be more humble, and should not have any sense of Party member superiority. There is still sectarianism in literary and art circles, which is more serious in some cultural and artistic departments and should be resolutely overcome. Disrespect for veteran artists, veteran writers, veteran painters, veteran journalists, veteran professors, and veteran actors is a manifestation of sectarianism. Zhou Yang emphasized that uniting all useful intellectuals is decisive for the cause of socialist construction.

    Should the Editorial Department Revise the Original Manuscript?

    Many writers are dissatisfied with the editorial department of the journals inappropriately modifying manuscripts, which is reasonable. Mao Dun said that editing work is a work of hard work and dedication. Editing work has shortcomings, but the revision of the original manuscript is still necessary. The revision should be agreed upon by the author. Quanlin said that currently some editorial departments do not respect the labor of writers, arbitrarily modify manuscripts without the author's consent, and even change the ideological content of the original work, which is not good. The motivation of the editorial department cannot be said to be bad, and some revisions are also necessary, such as the polishing of words, etc., but there are also revisions that have made it worse. Editors should treat the revision work seriously.

    Before the end of this symposium, Quanlin hoped that the editorial departments of various literary journals would continue to conduct discussions and vigorously implement the policies of the Party Central Committee, so that the literary journals in Beijing and the whole country would have a new look in the near future.

### 文艺刊物如何贯彻“放”的方针？

    文艺刊物如何贯彻“放”的方针？
    本报讯　自从毛泽东同志在最高国务会议和中共中央宣传工作会议上发表讲话以后，全国知识界对“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针有了进一步的认识。文艺刊物是实现这个方针的重要阵地，编辑部关于如何贯彻执行这个方针展开了热烈的讨论，并提出了许多问题。中国作家协会书记处在4月20日召开了北京文艺报刊编辑座谈会的第一次会议，出席的有茅盾、周扬、老舍、邵荃麟和“人民文学”、“文艺报”等刊物编辑部的主要人员等。茅盾等在会上讲了话。
    反“左”和反右，重点是什么？
    根据党的方针，刊物编辑部认识到在思想战线上应该进行反对“左”的教条主义和右倾机会主义的两条路线的斗争，但是他们希望进一步认识，批评的主要锋芒应该针对什么。茅盾等同志在讲话中都表示，根据目前情况，主要是要克服教条主义和宗派主义。因为目前对教条主义的批判，还存在着各种顾虑，例如：教条主义常和某些“领导思想”有关系；不少人对教条主义和马克思主义还不能区别清楚；很多人马克思主义修养不足，批判不了教条主义；教条主义不克服，就批评不倒资产阶级思想。周扬指出我们的思想常常落后于形势的发展，有些同志同中央方针的精神，在思想上有距离甚至抵触。荃麟指出，现在全国文艺编辑正在注意北京文艺刊物的动向，这些刊物必须充分体现“放”和“鸣”的方针。
    大放？小放？香花毒草齐放？
    有些编辑部怕放毒草，怕放了毒草后“挨整”，写检讨；有的怕放出毒草后难以批评，因为很难担保批评中没有教条主义。而这种缩手缩脚、稿子发不出的情形：毒草不敢放，教条主义不敢碰，香花不容易争取到，已经受到了人们的责问：“你们编辑部解冻了没有？”“编辑部是待月西厢下，迎风户半开。”周扬说，不要怕毒草。毒草是客观存在，避免不了，提出“避免毒草”的口号是主观主义的。而且香花和毒草在一个时期内常常不容易辨别清楚，常常是香中有毒，毒中有香，或者似毒非毒，提出避免毒草，实际还是不肯大放，要求一律放香花，这是不可能的。茅盾说，要求先鉴别了香花毒草之后才放，就是“半开门”，而不是“大开门”，“我看还是先大开了再说”。周扬也说现在不是要小放，要大放，更不是要收。要香花毒草齐放，让毒草放出来，有好处，一方面让大家认识一下毒草，另方面，好使香花和毒草竞赛，并对毒草进行有说服力的批评。不批评，是右倾；批评不等于收，也决不是“围剿”。
    老舍也认为毒草可以放，但是诲淫诲盗的东西不能放，这是毒蛇。在反对色情和低级趣味的文艺的同时，要注意把它们和描写爱情的文艺区别开来。他说，现在有“清教徒式”的风气，如把芭蕾舞看成色情的就是。不能把“美”和“黄色”混淆起来。
    有的刊物提出“站得稳才能放得开”，荃麟说，只能在“放”和“鸣”的过程中才能站得稳，不能先等站稳了再放。
    片面和全面的问题
    老舍说，许多片面可以合成全面，立刻要求全面可能一时办不到，对事物的全面认识需要通过逐步实践才能得到。我们应该养成民主生活。民主的方法就是许多片面凑成全面。目前关于小品文的讨论引起了他的兴趣。他说，有人看了小品文批评到他那一行，就懊恼，说是小品文有片面性。实则哪一行都不可能全部是好的，这种懊恼，表明了缺乏民主生活精神。荃麟认为应该力求全面。有片面性，犯错误，没有什么了不起。不要把对错误的批评搞得很紧张，应该让矛盾充分暴露出来。
    反对宗派主义
    在有些党和非党的知识分子中间还存在着隔阂或者紧张状态，有人说好像有一道墙。周扬认为这是某些党员知识分子身上的宗派主义作祟。党和非党之间应该有区别，但不应该有墙。党员应该工作得更多些，态度更谦逊些，而不应当有甚么党员优越感。文艺界还存在着宗派主义，在有的文化艺术部门中比较厉害，应该坚决予以克服。不尊重老艺人，老作家，老画家，老报人，老教授，老演员就是宗派主义的种种表现。周扬强调指出，团结一切有用的知识分子，对于社会主义建设事业有决定作用。
    编辑部改不改原稿？
    不少作家不满意刊物编辑部不适当地修改稿件，这是合理的。茅盾说编辑工作是任劳任怨的工作，编辑工作有缺点，但对原稿的修改还是需要的，修改要商得作者同意。荃麟说，目前有些编辑部不尊重作家的劳动，不经作者同意，任意修改稿件，甚至改变了原作的思想内容，这是不好的。编辑部的动机不能说不好，有些修改也是必要，如文字的润饰等，但是也有改坏了的。编辑应严肃对待修改工作。
    在这一次座谈会结束前，荃麟希望各文艺刊物编辑部继续进行讨论，大力贯彻执行党中央的方针，使北京和全国的文艺刊物在近期内有新的面貌出现。
