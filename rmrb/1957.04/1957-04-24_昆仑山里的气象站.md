    A Meteorological Station in the Kunlun Mountains
    Saitu’la is a place not yet found on maps. The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Meteorological Bureau has established a meteorological station here. Saitu’la is located southwest of Kashmir and abuts the Tibetan Plateau to the southeast; it is the only route from Xinjiang to Tibet, where mountains overlap, cliffs are thousands of feet high, snow accumulates on the mountains for ages, no grass grows in the valleys, wild animals roam, human traces are rare, and the weather is unpredictable. Last October, the Meteorological Bureau sent eleven people to build the station. They crossed the Osaka pass at an altitude of 5,900 meters, crossed countless turbulent streams, and overcame numerous difficulties to build an observation field there. On the afternoon of November 15, the Saitu’la Meteorological Station issued its first weather forecast and accumulated its first set of meteorological data. For more than four months, they have overcome all difficulties and created miracles, without any major errors, omissions, delays, or damage to instruments. The station has been awarded the honorary title of "Advanced Collective Work Station" by the Xinjiang Meteorological Bureau for its outstanding achievements.

    昆仑山里的气象站
    赛图拉，地图上还没有这个地方。新疆维吾尔自治区气象局在这里建立了一个气象站。赛图拉西南靠近克什米尔，东南傍依西藏高原；是新疆入藏必经之路，那里山峦重叠，峭壁千尺，山上亘古积雪，山谷寸草不生，野兽出没，人迹罕到，天气变化无常。去年10月，气象局派出了十一位建站人员，他们翻越海拔五千九百公尺的大坂，渡过无数条湍急的流水，克服重重困难，在那里修建起观测场。11月15日下午，赛图拉气象站发出了第一次天气预报，积累了第一份气象资料。四个多月以来，他们排除万难，创造了奇迹，没有出过重大错误，没有漏发、迟发、损坏仪器的现象。该站以优异的成绩获得新疆气象局集体先进工作站的光荣称号。
