Xinhua News Agency, Zhanjiang, 9th: The twenty large and small-scale water conservancy projects and eight seawalls built by the People's Liberation Army stationed in the Leizhou Peninsula to help local agricultural production cooperatives are now basically completed.

To help local farmers strive for a bumper harvest this year, the troops stationed in the Leizhou Peninsula suspended work and training for two weeks starting from March 15th, and fully invested in the construction of water conservancy projects. Over the past twenty days, they have excavated and filled more than 360,000 cubic meters of earth. The twenty reservoirs, canals, and ponds that have been built can irrigate more than 130,000 mu of farmland. Among them, the Binyang Reservoir, built by a certain unit, has officially started releasing water, providing sufficient water sources for more than 50,000 mu of farmland in thirteen nearby townships, allowing the land that originally grew single-season rice to be converted to double-season rice, and many drylands have also been turned into paddy fields. It is estimated that grain production can be increased by 185 million jin per year.

Some coastal farmlands in the Leizhou Peninsula have suffered from reduced harvests over the years due to sea tide intrusion. Under the slogan of "turning beaches into fertile fields," officers and soldiers have helped local people build eight seawalls, preventing more than 15,000 mu of coastal farmland from being affected by tides.

PLA Undertakes More Than Half of the Tasks in Greening the Capital
Xinhua News Agency, 9th: The organs and troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing will plant 500,000 to 600,000 trees in this year's capital greening work. This figure accounts for 50% to 60% of the total number of trees planned to be planted in Beijing this year.

Since Qingming Festival, officers, soldiers, and wage earners of various units have successively started planting trees and afforestation according to the designated areas. The staff of the Navy leading organ rushed to the eastern suburbs early in the morning on the 7th to carry out tree planting activities. They will plant more than 14,900 trees here to cultivate a shelterbelt more than 40 meters wide and more than 700 meters long. The officers and soldiers of a certain unit who planted trees in Ritan walked from their駐地 more than ten li away. Officers and soldiers of the Armored Forces leading organ have planted more than 9,500 trees in the western suburbs. More than 30 officers and soldiers of a motorized company of the Public Security Army planted 500 trees in the South Changhe in half a day.

Troops Stationed in Wuqing, Hebei Help Farmers Transform Low-lying Land
Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 9th: More than 1,300 officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Wuqing County, Hebei Province, set off for the second time on the morning of the 7th, carrying red flags and beating gongs and drums, to help nearby agricultural cooperatives transform low-lying land. The officers and soldiers worked enthusiastically in the sunshine, and some even launched a digging competition, striving to complete the task ahead of schedule.

The officers and soldiers of this unit have had close ties with local agricultural cooperatives since the spring of last year, often supporting agricultural cooperative production and helping solve difficulties. Based on the local low-lying terrain and the historical situation of waterlogging disasters, this unit plans to use Sundays in the first half of this year to support eight agricultural cooperatives with 7,500 man-days to repair dams, sluices, and river embankments; to support eight agricultural cooperatives with more than 1,600 man-days and more than 130 horse-days to deliver manure, cultivate land, and sow seeds; and also to send more than 750,000 jin of manure to these agricultural cooperatives and help some agricultural cooperatives inspect livestock and carry out disease prevention and treatment work.

    为了建设祖国，解放军辛勤劳动
    在雷州半岛上兴修水利工程和防潮海堤
    新华社湛江9日电　中国人民解放军驻雷州半岛部队帮助当地农业生产合作社兴修的二十项大小水利工程和八条防潮海堤，已经在最近基本完工。
    驻雷州半岛各部队为了帮助当地农民争取今年大丰收，从3月15日起都停止工作和训练两个星期，先后全力投入水利工程的建设。二十多天来，他们共挖土、填土三十六万多立方公尺。已经修好的二十处水库、水渠、水塘等可以灌溉田地十三万多亩。其中，某部修建的滨洋水库，已经正式起闸放水，可以使附近十三个乡、五万多亩田得到了充分的水源，从而原来种单季稻的田可以改种双季稻，许多旱田也变成了水田，预计每年可以增产粮食一亿八千五百万斤。
    雷州半岛沿海有些田地因为受海潮侵袭，历年歉收。官兵们在“变海滩为良田”的口号下，帮助当地人民修建了八条海堤，使沿海一万五千多亩田地不再受潮水侵袭。
    绿化首都工作中解放军担负一半以上任务
    新华社9日讯　中国人民解放军驻北京各机关、部队，在今年首都绿化工作中，将植树五十万到六十万棵。这个数字占北京市今年计划植树总数的50％到60％。
    清明节以来，各部队官兵和工薪制人员已经按照划分地段陆续开始植树造林。海军领导机关的工作人员，7日一清早就赶到东郊进行植树活动。他们将在这里栽树一万四千九百多棵，培植一条四十多公尺宽、七百多公尺长的防护林带。在日坛栽树的某部官兵，是从十里以外的驻地徒步赶来的。装甲兵领导机关官兵在西郊园圃已经植树九千五百多棵。公安军某部摩托化连的官兵三十多人，半天内在南长河栽树五百棵。
    河北武清驻军帮助农民改造洼地
    新华社保定9日电　解放军驻河北省武清县某部一千三百多名官兵，7日晨打着红旗，敲着锣鼓，第二次出发帮助附近农业社改造洼地。官兵们在阳光照耀下热情劳动，有的还展开挖土竞赛，争着要领先完成任务。
    这支部队的官兵们从去年春天起就和当地农业社有着密切的联系，经常支援农业社生产和帮助解决困难。根据当地地势洼，历年水涝成灾的情况，今年上半年这支部队计划利用星期天，以七千五百个人工支援八个农业社修水坝、水闸、河堤；以一千六百多个人工和一百三十多个马工，支援八个农业社送粪、耕地和播种；还要送给这些农业社七十五万多斤粪肥和帮助一些农业社检查牲口，进行疫病预防和治疗等工作。（附图片）
