Xinhua News Agency report: As a major city supporting the construction of Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex, Wuhan Municipality has played a significant role in supporting the construction of Wuhan Iron and Steel.

    The commercial departments of Wuhan Municipality have devised various methods to ensure the supply to the Wuhan Iron and Steel construction site. Nearly a hundred supply points have been successively established at the construction site. At the same time, some well-known joint state-private restaurants, photo studios, barbershops, dry cleaners, and Chinese and Western pharmacies were relocated from the city. The three large vegetable markets near the workers' village regularly supply various fresh vegetables produced locally.
    The industrial and handicraft industries of Wuhan Municipality are also actively processing various accessories and parts and repairing machinery for Wuhan Iron and Steel. The joint state-private Kangtai Electric Motor Factory devoted all its efforts to processing various power distribution boxes, transformers, and other electrical equipment for Wuhan Iron and Steel throughout the year. Nearly thirty ironware production cooperatives in the city manufactured more than four hundred tons of urgently needed screws, track spikes, and fishplates for the project within a tight timeframe.

    武汉市商业和手工业积极支援武钢建设
    据新华社讯　作为武汉钢铁联合企业建设依托的大城市——武汉市，在支援武钢建设中发挥了巨大的作用。
    武汉市商业部门想出各种办法，作好武钢工地的供应工作。在建设工地上陆续设立起了近百个供应点，同时从市内搬迁了一些较著名的公私合营餐馆、照相馆、理发店、洗染店，以及中西药店等。工人村附近的三个大菜场经常供应当地生产的各种新鲜蔬菜。
    武汉市的工业、手工业也积极为武钢加工各种配件、零件和修理机械。公私合营康太电机厂拿出全部力量整年为武钢加工各种配电箱、变压器等电机设备。全市近三十个铁器生产社，在紧迫的时间内，替武钢制造了四百多吨工程上急需的螺丝、道钉、夹板等。
