    “If There Is Injustice, There Will Be A Cry”
    Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the CPPCC Discusses the "Hundred Schools of Thought" Policy
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd -- The First Committee of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the CPPCC held its Third Plenary Session starting from the 20th. The meeting first conveyed Chairman Mao Zedong's speech at the Supreme State Conference on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, and began group discussions on the 21st.
    This group discussion was very enthusiastic. When discussing the "Hundred Schools of Thought" policy, member Tang Junyuan said: There are various ways to "cry out" in the contention, one is the "cry" of "if there is injustice, there will be a cry", which is "venting grievances", which is not good, we do not want this kind of "cry". Xu Jiatun, Secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the CPC, believed that "if there is injustice, one must cry out." Xie Kexi, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, also said: "Injustice means there are contradictions." Xu Jiatun said: "Crying it out will help solve the contradiction, and one can achieve fairness." The members believed that affirming this point was very important so that thoughts could be opened up.
    In a panel discussion attended by more than 20 former KMT military and political personnel, some exposed the contradictions found during inspections, but some suggested not to "cry out" about everything casually, fearing that "crying out" would create chaos. Member Li Wending said: "Trying to cover up contradictions does not mean that the contradictions do not exist. To speed up the construction of our motherland, we must lay out the contradictions and deal with them correctly."
    Professor Wu Darong, Vice President of Nanjing Institute of Technology, recalled the feelings of intellectuals in the early days of liberation during the panel discussion, saying: At that time, everyone only sang praises to the Party, but they were half-believing and half-doubting in their hearts. Now it is different, they have become their own people. On the surface, there is less praise for the Party and more opinions on the work and leadership, but their hearts are full of love for the Party and the cause of socialism.
    Member Liu Yunzhao cited the story of King Wei of Qi accepting Zou Ji's advice and opening up avenues of speech, rewarding those who spoke out, as an example, believing that in addition to those who speak out are not guilty, those who speak out should also be rewarded. He also suggested that the government formulate a punishment regulation for those who retaliate, and widely publicize this regulation so that the masses dare to expose problems. The meeting is still in progress.

    “不平则鸣”
    政协江苏省委员会讨论“百家争鸣”方针
    新华社南京23日电　政协江苏省第一届委员会从20日起举行第三次全体会议。会议首先传达了毛泽东主席在最高国务会议上关于正确地处理人民内部矛盾问题的讲话，21日起开始分小组讨论。
    这一次小组讨论非常热烈。委员唐君远在讨论中谈到“百家争鸣”的方针时说：争鸣有各种各样的鸣法，一种是“不平则鸣”的“鸣”，这是“发牢骚”，这不好，我们不要这种“鸣”。中共江苏省委书记许家屯则认为“不平就要鸣”。江苏省工会联合会主席谢克西也说：“不平就是有矛盾。”许家屯说：“鸣出来就能有利于矛盾的解决，就能得到平。”委员们认为肯定这一点很重要，这样思想就能敞开。
    在有二十多个前国民党军政人员参加的小组会上，有的揭露了视察中所发现的矛盾，但也有人提出不要随便什么都“鸣”，怕“鸣”乱了。委员李文定说：“想把矛盾盖起来不等于矛盾就不存在。要加快建设我们的祖国，就要把矛盾摊开来，正确地处理。”
    南京工学院副院长吴大榕教授在小组会上回忆解放初期知识分子的心情说：那时大家对党只歌颂一番，但心里是信疑参半。现在不同了，成了自己人，表面对党的歌颂少了，对工作与领导提些意见，但他们的心里充满了对党、对社会主义事业的热爱。
    委员刘云昭在会上举出历史上齐威王纳邹忌之谏，大开言路，对言者有赏的故事作为例子，认为除言者无罪外，还应该言者有赏。他还建议政府对打击报复者制定一个惩治条例，并广泛宣传这种条例，使群众勇于揭露问题。会议还在继续进行。
