Xinhua News Agency, 1st dispatch: "When we see people we detest become successful and rise rapidly in the world, we inadvertently blurt out: 'That's really dog luck.' In fact, now is truly an era of 'dog luck flourishing.' The status and enjoyment of some famous dogs make us sigh with emotion, 'Humans are not as good as dogs.'" This is the opening paragraph of a special feature entitled "Dog Luck Flourishing" recently published in a Taiwanese newspaper. This special feature introduces the situation of some American invaders stationed in Taiwan and some local "dignitaries" and "celebrated ladies" who "raise beloved dogs," reflecting from the side the licentious lives and spiritual emptiness of these people.

The newspaper said that the current market price of dogs in Taipei is generally based on puppies, with US dollars as the currency of transaction. English Mastiffs, Boxers, All-Purpose Dogs, Toy Dogs, French White Lion Dogs, Aristocrat Dogs, German Dachshunds, Spanish Small Bird Hunting Dogs, American Baby Dogs, etc., are all worth between US$50 and US$200 each. Colonel Aitermans of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group in Taiwan raised a dog worth more than $1,000. Senior Kuomintang officials such as He Yingqin, Yang Sen, Hong Lanyou, Wei Daoming, and Wang Shuming, all keep dogs that are said to be very valuable.

The newspaper said that these dogs are used by Taiwan's "current general gentlemen, wealthy people, and celebrated ladies as decorations, as playthings, and as good friends to dispel loneliness." Many of these dogs are "well-cared for and pampered. When they get sick, going to dog hospitals for injections and medicine costs more than it does for people. After the puppies are born, in addition to eating their mother's milk, they also drink milk and goat's milk, and are nourished with glucose and calcium tablets. Within the first forty days of birth, fearing they have worms in their stomachs, they must eat a packet of Zhegu Cai (a type of vegetable used as medicine for worms) costing four Taiwan dollars a packet every day. As the puppies gradually grow larger, their appetite increases, and milk, beef, and mutton must be supplied in large quantities. Celebrities are very particular about what they eat, and famous dogs are not sloppy about their food either; they absolutely refuse to eat leftovers from the previous day; they won't eat plain rice unless they are extremely hungry."

The newspaper said that Taiwan's "famous dogs" do not have to worry about housing; they don't have to build "illegal structures" like Taiwan's poor people. Most of them live in "small mansions" inside large mansions. French aristocrat dogs are "good companions" for some "celebrated ladies" in Taiwan; they follow behind them on the street, sit close to them when they read, and sleep with their mistresses in the room at night. The wife of a bank manager in Taipei raised a small foreign dog. Because she loved the dog more than her husband, the couple almost divorced because of the dog.

The newspaper said that in recent years, Taipei has held "dog exhibitions" every year, in which dogs raised by those "dog-loving" masters, wives, and young ladies participate, "competing" for championships and runners-up. "Dog schools" that train dogs in various skills have also emerged in Taiwan. These famous dogs "get injections and medicine when they are sick, and there are ten canine clinics in Taipei alone, all of which are bustling with activity and have thriving businesses." In Taiwan, there is also a group of dog dealers, "They are very familiar with which family raises famous dogs, which family's female dog is 'pregnant,' which family's puppies are for sale, and which family wants to buy a dog. It is said that these dog-dealing experts are planning to open a dog market in Taipei to concentrate on publicly selling dogs."

While the Taiwan newspaper published "Dog Luck Flourishing," it also published some Taiwan social news, which was a stark contrast to "Dog Luck Flourishing." For example, Li Junqing, a retired soldier of the Chiang army, drifted from Kaohsiung in southern Taiwan to Hsinchu in northern Taiwan in search of a job, but was unable to find one. He collapsed at the station due to hunger, and the sound of his groaning in pain was unbearable to hear. Later, bystanders sent him to the hospital, and after receiving an injection, he was sent out of the hospital gate. Homeless, he spent the night in the open air, drenched by the cold rain.

### 台湾的“狗运亨通”

    台湾的“狗运亨通”
    新华社1日讯　“当我们看到我们憎厌的人飞黄腾达，青云直上的时候，不经意的会溜口说出：这真是‘狗运亨通’。事实上，现在确是个‘狗运亨通’的时代。有些名狗的身价、享受，使我们见了，不禁油然而生‘人不如狗’的感叹。”这是台湾一家报纸最近发表题为“狗运亨通”的一篇特写的开场白。这篇特写介绍了今日台湾的一些侵台的美国佬和当地的一些“达官贵人”、“名媛闺秀”等“畜养爱犬”的情况，从侧面反映了这些人生活上的荒淫和精神上的无聊空虚。
    报纸说，现在台北市一般的狗行情，是以小狗为交易对象，美金为交易货币。英国的玛司梯夫狗、拳师狗、万能狗、玩具狗，法国的白狮狗、贵族狗，德国的矮脚狗，西班牙的小型鸟猎狗，美国的娃娃狗等等，每头都值美金五十元到二百元之间。美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团上校爱特曼斯养了一头价值一千美元以上的狗，国民党高级官员何应钦、杨森、洪兰友、魏道明、王叔铭等，都养了据说是很值钱的狗。
    报纸说，这些狗是台湾“现在一般的绅士富翁，名媛闺秀，用它来作装饰，当玩物，做排遣寂寞的良友”。这些狗许多都是“养尊处优，娇生惯养。它们生病了，到狗医院打针吃药，比人花的钱还多。小狗生后，除吃母狗的奶外，还要喝牛奶羊奶，用葡萄糖和钙片给它们滋补。初生的四十天内，惟恐肚里有虫，四元台币一包的鹧鸪菜，每天非吃一包不可。小狗渐渐大了，食量增加，牛奶、牛肉、羊肉，要大量供应才行。名人吃东西很讲究，名狗吃食物也不马虎，隔夜的食物是绝口不给它吃的；非至肚子饿急了，白米饭是不吃的。”
    报纸说，台湾的“名狗”住的问题是不愁的，不必像台湾贫民一样要搭盖“违章建筑”，它们多数是住在大公馆里面的“小公馆”内。法国贵族狗是台湾一些“名媛”们的“良好伴侣，上街它尾后而行，看书它相偎而坐，晚上它在房间里与女主人一起睡觉”。台北市一家银行经理的太太养了一头小洋狗，她因爱狗甚于爱丈夫，两夫妇几乎因狗闹离婚。
    报纸说，台北市近年来每年都举行“畜犬展览会”，由那些“畜养爱犬”的老爷们、太太们和小姐们养的狗参加展览，“竞选”什么冠军、亚军。一些训练狗各种技能的“狗学校”，在台湾也应运而生。这些名狗“病了要打针吃药，只是台北市就有十家犬病诊疗所，家家门庭若市，生意兴隆”。在台湾还有一批狗贩子，“他们对谁家养有名狗，谁家的母狗有‘喜’了，谁家的小狗要出售，谁家要买狗，都很熟悉。据说这些贩狗专家，正计划在台北辟一狗市场，好集中公开贩卖”。
    在台湾报纸刊载“狗运亨通”的同时，另外登出了一些台湾社会新闻，与“狗运亨通”恰好是强烈的对照。例如蒋军退役军人黎俊卿，从台湾南部的高雄流浪到台湾北部的新竹找寻职业无着，因饥饿在车站病倒了，喊痛的吟呻声音惨不忍闻，后来旁人把他送往医院，打针后被送出医院大门，无家可归，露天过夜，受寒雨所淋。
