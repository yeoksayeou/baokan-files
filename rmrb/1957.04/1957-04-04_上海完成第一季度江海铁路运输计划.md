Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 3rd. Shanghai's river, sea, and railway transportation departments overfulfilled the first quarter's transportation plan by more than 98,000 tons of cargo.

　　Cargo volume was ample this quarter, and the freight volume of the Shanghai Railway Administration was greater than in any corresponding period since liberation. Transportation workers took various measures to improve the loading capacity of vehicles and ships. The Shanghai Branch of the Yangtze River Shipping Administration improved the towing technology of tugboats, and the towing capacity of tugboats generally increased. The "No. 204" tugboat pushed 6,000 tons of cargo with 185 horsepower, setting the highest record for tugboat towing capacity on the entire Yangtze River. On the Wenzhou-Dalian line, the crew members of the Shanghai Maritime Administration's cargo ships adopted methods such as taking economic routes and using small turns during navigation, which increased the average daily speed of each ship by 7.88 nautical miles compared to the same period last year, greatly accelerating the turnaround of ships. Six ore-carrying freighters also loaded some ore on the deck, increasing the load capacity of each voyage by more than 1,000 tons.

    上海完成第一季度江海铁路运输计划
    新华社上海3日电　上海的江、海、铁路等交通运输部门，第一季度比计划多运输了九万八千多吨货物。
    这一季度的货源充足，上海铁路管理局的货运量比解放以来任何一年的同期都多。运输工人多方设法来提高车船的装运能力。长江航运管理局上海分局改进拖轮拖带技术，拖轮的拖带量普遍提高。“二○四号”拖轮以一百八十五马力顶推了六千吨货物，创造长江全线拖轮拖带量的最高纪录。在温州——大连线上，上海区海运管理局货轮的船员采取走经济航线、航行时用小转弯等方法，使每艘船平均每天的航速比去年同期提高七点八八海里，大大加快了船舶周转。六艘运输矿石的海轮，还在甲板上装了一部分矿石，使每次航行的装载量提高了一千吨以上。
