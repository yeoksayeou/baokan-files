    Myanmar's Water Festival

    When Prime Minister U Nu of the Union of Burma recently visited Kunming, China, he invited the Governor of Yunnan Province and a cultural delegation from Yunnan Province to visit Burma this month and celebrate the Water Festival with the Burmese people.

    The Burmese Water Festival is a joyous lunar New Year festival for all the people of Burma, similar to China's Spring Festival. The Burmese calendar differs from the Gregorian calendar by more than three months, and the Water Festival falls in April of the Gregorian calendar. This year, the Water Festival is from April 12th to 15th. The day after (16th) is the Burmese Lunar New Year, the beginning of Burmese year 1319.

    During the Water Festival, people are immersed in a lively and joyful atmosphere, singing, dancing, and drumming. Whether in the city or the countryside, there is a scene of carnival everywhere.

    The tradition of splashing water on each other is the characteristic of this joyful festival. In the past, people used a silver bowl filled with clean water and fragrant water infused with flowers, dipped flower branches in the water and gently sprinkled a few drops on passers-by, or splashed water on people, while saying auspicious words to wish them to remove the misfortune of the year and welcome a happy life in the new year. In recent years, the meaning of splashing water remains the same, but the patterns have become more and more diverse.

    During the Water Festival every year, the streets are crowded with people coming and going. They put on beautiful festive costumes, wearing various colorful sarongs. Many girls also wear snow-white transparent nylon tops, which are particularly bright and dazzling in the hot sunshine of the tropical April. Everyone holds silver bowls, buckets, and water guns filled with water, waiting to splash water on passers-by. Children as young as seven or eight years old also participate in the splashing of water with water sprayers. Anyone can be splashed, and no one complains about being drenched like a drowned rat, but happily shouts: "Ita Bo!" (meaning I will laugh it off!). Some even express gratitude to the water splashers, meaning that they have received happiness. Young girls are even more the objects in the hearts of young men, and they are often splashed so much that they dare not look up until they repeatedly beg for mercy. At this time, it is often an opportunity for young men to seek love, and no one wants to miss it.

    In a very popular and beautiful song during the Water Festival, there is a lyric that expresses their feelings:
      Girls, congratulations on your health and happiness in the New Year,
      Splash as much as you like, girls,
      Wet clothes will make you even younger and more beautiful.

    Everywhere you can see colorful canopies, where various beautiful dances and melodious songs are performed. On the streets, there are also various exquisitely decorated floats, such as "Peacock" floats, "Lion" floats, etc., often forming a motorcade. Young men and women sing various melodious songs and fast-clappers on the floats, and perform various beautiful dances, adding rich colors to the joyous festival.

    Overseas Chinese living in Burma participate in the splashing of water every year with the same joyful and excited mood during this joyous festival, and congratulate the Burmese people, who are like relatives, with programs that express the friendship between the Chinese and Burmese people.

    There are many different legends about the origin of the Burmese Water Festival. The following is one of the more interesting of these legends. It is said that when the universe was created, the Heavenly Emperor and the Maha Min Ma God bet their heads on a math problem. As a result, the Maha Min Ma God lost and was beheaded by the Heavenly Emperor. But the Heavenly Emperor found it very difficult to deal with this head. Because if the head was thrown into the sky, the pillars of heaven would be broken; if it was thrown into the sea, the sea would boil; if it was thrown on the ground, the earth would become a scorched earth. There was nowhere in the world to place this strange head, so the Heavenly Emperor had to hand it over to seven fairies to take turns holding it. When it is passed to another fairy, this is the beginning of the year. Later, an elephant's head was installed on the corpse of the Maha Min Ma God, and he was resurrected by splashing immortal water on it. Therefore, the custom of sprinkling clean water to eliminate disasters and accept blessings arose. The Water Festival has become a joyous festival for all the people of Burma.

### 缅甸的泼水节

    缅甸的泼水节
    缅甸联邦吴努总理最近访问我国昆明时，曾邀请云南省省长等和云南省的一个文化代表团于本月间访问缅甸，同缅甸人民欢度泼水节。
    缅甸的泼水节，是缅甸全民的一个欢乐的旧历节日，类似我国的春节。缅甸的历法和公历相差三个多月，泼水节就在公历4月间。今年，从4月12日到15日，是泼水节的日子。过后一天（16日），就是缅甸的旧历新年，即缅历1319年的开始。
    在泼水节期间，人们沉浸在热闹欢乐的气氛中，载歌载舞，锣鼓喧天。无论是城市或乡村，到处洋溢着一片狂欢景象。
    大家互相泼水是这个欢快节日的特色。以往，人们用一个银钵，盛着洁净的清水和浸有芬芳的花朵的香水，用花枝蘸水向行人轻轻喷上几滴，或往人们身上泼去，同时说几句吉祥的话，祝他除去一年中的凶歹，迎接新年的幸福生活。近几年来，泼水的意义依然如故，但花样却越来越多了。
    在每年泼水节的日子里，大街上挤满了川流不息的人群。他们换上漂亮的节日盛装，穿着各种五颜六色的纱笼。许多姑娘们还穿着雪白的透明的尼龙上衣，在热带的四月天的炽热的阳光底下，特别显得鲜艳夺目、花枝招展。大家手里拿着装满了水的银钵、水桶和水龙，等着向来往的行人泼水。七八岁的小孩也拿着喷水筒参加泼水。不管任何人都可以泼，被泼得像落汤鸡那样满身淋漓，也没有任何怨言，只是高兴地喊着：“依达驳”！（意思是我将一笑置之）。有的还向泼水者表示感谢，意味着已经得到幸福。少女们更是小伙子心目中的对象，常常被泼得不敢抬头，直到连连求饶，这时，往往就是小伙子们寻爱的机会，谁也不愿意放过。
    在泼水节非常流行的一支优美的歌子中，有一段歌词表达了他们的心情：
      姑娘们，祝贺你们新年健康和愉快，
      尽情地泼吧，姑娘们，
      湿透了的衣裳将使你们更加年轻美丽。
    人们到处都可以看到五彩缤纷的彩棚，上面表演着各种优美的舞蹈和悦耳的歌曲。街头上还有装饰得十分精致的各种各样的花车，如“孔雀”花车，“狮子”花车等，常常排成车队，小伙子和姑娘们在车上欢唱各种悦耳的歌谣和快板，表演各种美丽的舞蹈，给欢乐的节日增加了丰富的色采。
    旅居缅甸的华侨，在这欢欣的佳节里，每年都怀着同样愉快和兴奋的心情参加泼水，并带着表现中缅人民友谊的节目，向亲戚般的缅甸人民祝贺。
    缅甸泼水节的来源有许多不同的传说。下面是这些传说中有趣的一个。据说，当宇宙创造时，天帝和玛哈敏玛神为了争辩一个算题而打赌脑袋。结果玛哈敏玛神输了，他被天帝砍掉脑袋。但如何处理这个脑袋，却使天帝感到非常棘手。因为如果把脑袋抛上天空，则天柱就会摧折；如果扔在大海里，海水就会沸腾；如丢在地上，大地就会成为一片焦土，天地间无处安置这颗奇怪的脑袋，天帝只好把它交由七位仙女轮流捧在手中。当传递给另一位仙女时，这就是一年的开始。后来用大象的头安装在玛哈敏玛神的尸体上，用长生仙水一泼，他便复活了。所以后来就产生了洒泼清水以消灾纳福的风俗。泼水节也就成为缅甸全民欢乐的节日。
