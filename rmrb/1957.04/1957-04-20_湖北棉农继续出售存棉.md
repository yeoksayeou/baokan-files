    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, April 19th: Hubei Province, which had a bumper cotton harvest last year, has purchased more than 3 million dan of cotton so far, an increase of more than 38% compared to the entire production year of 1955. Farmers are continuing to sell stored cotton.

    Since March, the cotton market has entered the off-season. In addition to maintaining the original 800-plus purchasing stations throughout the province, the purchasing departments of Hubei Province have also organized more than 1,200 purchasing personnel to go deep into various townships and villages to carry out publicity and mobile purchasing. Many key cotton-producing areas are also combining this year's cotton pre-purchasing with strengthening the supply of daily necessities in order to expand the volume of stored cotton purchased.

    湖北棉农继续出售存棉
    据新华社武汉19日电　去年棉花丰收的湖北省，到目前为止已收购到三百多万担棉花，比1955年整个生产年度收购的棉花增加了38％多。农民还在继续出售存棉。
    3月份以来，棉花上市已进入淡季，湖北省采购部门除了保持全省原有八百多个收购点以外，各产棉县还组织了一千二百多个采购人员深入各乡各村，进行宣传和流动收购。许多重点棉产区还结合本年度的棉花预购和加强日用品供应工作，来扩大存棉收购量。
