Responding to the Call to Save Cotton Cloth

    The Responsibility of Tailors
    Zhang Zhongzhi, Chen Ziqing, Jia Qingren

    We support the State Council's decision to halve the usage of the second round of cloth coupons this year.

    We tailors also have a responsibility to help the country and customers save cloth. In the past, we always asked customers for a few extra inches of fabric because it required less thought and saved labor. If we didn't ask for extra, we would have to compensate if we ruined the cutting.

    Since the launch of the Increase Production and Practice Economy campaign this year, we have formed a technical research group composed of salespersons, cutters, and workshop leaders to calculate fabric usage together and study methods for saving cloth. When accepting work, we carefully measure the dimensions; if the received fabric size is tight, we draw chalk lines and carefully calculate to try to make it sufficient.

    A few days ago, a female comrade brought a piece of seven-foot gabardine fabric and wanted to make a "Capital Style" jacket. She asked three tailors, and all of them said that it couldn't be done with less than eight feet of fabric. The three of us repeatedly calculated for her and barely managed to cut it out and make it. The female comrade was very happy.

    From this incident, we can see that the potential for tailoring technicians and workers to save cloth is still very great. Now, in addition to us working harder ourselves to think of ways to save cloth, we also hope that tailoring technicians and workers across the country will not be afraid of trouble and do their best to save cloth for the country and customers. Remaking old clothes is also a good way to save cloth. There are many sewing shops in Shanghai that specialize in replacing collars and cuffs and altering clothes for customers. Although there are some such sewing shops in Beijing now, there are not enough. To fully meet the needs of customers for altering clothes, it is necessary to expand this type of business more widely.

    裁缝工人的责任
    张忠之　陈子清　贾庆仁
    我们拥护国务院关于今年第二期布票对折使用的决定。
    我们裁缝工人也有责任帮助国家和顾客节省用布。过去，我们向顾客要衣料，总是多要上几寸布，因为这样可以少费脑筋，又省工。如果不多要几寸布，裁剪坏了还要包赔。
    今年开展增产节约运动以来，我们就由业务员、裁剪员和车间组长组成一个技术研究组，共同计算衣料，研究省布的方法。接收做活的时候，认真地量尺寸；如果接到的衣料尺寸紧，就画上粉线，仔细计算，想法使它够用。
    在前几天，有一个女同志带来一块七尺华达呢布料，要作一件“首都服”上衣，她连问了三家都说非八尺布不能做。我们三个人反复地给她计算，勉强裁下来，做成了，这位女同志很高兴。
    从这件事可以看出，裁缝技师和工人节省用布的潜力还是很大的。现在，除我们自己要更多开动脑筋，想法省布外，还希望全国裁缝技师和工人都能不怕麻烦，尽力为国家和顾客节省用布。拆旧翻新，也是节约用布的一个好方法。上海有很多专门为顾客换衣领、换袖子、翻改衣服的缝衣店。北京市现在虽然也有一些这样的缝衣店，但是还不够多。为了充分满足顾客翻改衣服的需要，需要更广泛地开展这种业务。（附图片）
