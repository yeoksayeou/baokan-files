Works, Fine Works, Masterpieces
	Gao Zhi

	Spring has arrived, the North Sea ripples, and the small boats, after their long winter hibernation, are no longer landlocked, but float on the sea like frogs, rising and falling. The leaves have not yet budded, and the trees cast shadows without foliage in the sunlight. At this time of year, wearing winter clothes and basking in the sun is a bit too warm; wearing spring clothes and facing the sea breeze still feels chilly. But spring has indeed arrived.

	In front of the Nine-Dragon Wall, I met a writer and a literary critic. We sat down together at an open-air tea garden. The critic began by saying that many articles about the Hundred Flowers Blooming have been written, but no great masterpieces have yet appeared. The critic hoped that the writer would produce great works and asked if he could deliver them in 1957. The writer also hoped that the critic would write great essays that are neither dogmatic nor fail to guide the direction of creation, neither dismissive nor without encouragement, and also asked if he would produce exemplary articles in 1957. So these two friends smiled at each other, seeming to understand each other's meaning: we must not allow laziness, nor be too hasty.

	In recent years, although no one has pointed out which works are immortal masterpieces or epoch-making great works, there have been many fine works.

	Today, we have the right to demand masterpieces, to demand the emergence of a second Cao Xueqin, a second Lu Xun, to demand more Mao Duns and Lao Shes. However, we must not ignore that masterpieces have their material basis and will not come at our beck and call.

	Today, our basic problem is the issue of works. Fine works are selected from works, and masterpieces are compared from fine works. Fine works are the foundation of masterpieces, and works are the foundation of fine works. Today, we do not have too many works, but too few; not that the Hundred Flowers Blooming is sufficient, but that it is not enough. Precisely because of this, the Party calls for the Hundred Flowers Blooming.

	Just as our country currently needs more scientists, our country also needs more artists. There are not too many writers, but too few. Last year, on February 28th, Babayevsky told hundreds of Chinese writers that the number of Chinese writers was too small, which was not commensurate with China's international status.

	How many writers are there in the Soviet Union? In December 1954, the Soviet Union had three thousand six hundred and ninety-five members of the Writers' Association.

	In any era, in any country, there will never be too many masterpieces; great writers are also few. Of the ten thousand quatrains of the Tang Dynasty, even selected works are not all fine works, and the masterpieces that have been passed down to this day are even fewer in number. Poets emerged in large numbers during the Tang Dynasty, but Li Bai, Du Fu, Gao Shi, Wang Wei, Yuan Zhen, and Bai Juyi were also rare. Even taking Li Bai and Du Fu as examples, not every one of their poems is a masterpiece, like "A pot of wine among the flowers" and "News of the recovery of Jibei suddenly arrives from beyond the sword" which are recited through the ages.

	England has only one Shakespeare; Lenin believed that there was only one unparalleled Russian novelist in Europe, Leo Tolstoy. Shakespeare's works are divided into masterpieces and fine works, and in the ninety volumes of Leo Tolstoy's complete works, only a few are considered masterpieces.

	I absolutely do not have the naive idea that building factories is easy. I feel that the emergence of a great writer, an immortal masterpiece, is not easier than building a factory, and is sometimes even more difficult. England has thousands upon thousands of factories, but the likes of Dickens and Byron can hardly number one hundred; the Soviet Union also has thousands upon thousands of the most modern factories, but there are not many writers like Mikhail Sholokhov, who wrote *And Quiet Flows the Don*, and Alexander Fadeyev, who wrote *The Young Guard*.

	Our policy of the Hundred Flowers Blooming has only just begun to be implemented, and we are already reaching out for masterpieces; if there is no intention to "checkmate you," it can be said to be impatience.

	We want masterpieces, but first we must have fine works. We want fine works, but first we must have works. Our problem is, first of all, to prosper creation. Only with the Hundred Flowers Blooming can we see a riot of color; only with the competition of all the flowers can we see the king of flowers. It is unrealistic to want to eat peaches as soon as the peach blossoms bloom.

	However, promoting creation is not a one-sided pursuit of quantity, allowing shoddy work; and setting time and conditions is not the same as waiting for a rabbit to run into a tree stump; it is only a general saying that prosperous creation is a more reliable foundation for masterpieces. Premier Zhou Enlai correctly pointed out in his "Report on the Question of Intellectuals" that "quality generally can only be produced on a certain quantitative basis."

	The progress of the times enables us to hope that among a hundred works, there will be more fine works than in the past, and among fifty fine works, there will be more masterpieces than in the past. Who is selecting, who is comparing? Besides critics, there are also tens of thousands of readers.

    著作，佳作，杰作
    高植
    春天到了，北海涟漪荡漾，小艇过了长冬后的惊蛰，不复陆栖，蛙似地在海上如沉如浮。树叶还未出芽，树木在阳光下有影无荫。这时节，穿冬衣，晒太阳，有些太暖；穿春装，迎着海风，仍感春寒料峭。春天毕竟来了。
    在九龙壁前，我碰见了一位作家和一位文艺批评家。我们一同到露天茶座里坐下来了。批评家首先谈到，有人认为关于百花齐放的文章写了不少，但伟大的杰作还未见问世。批评家希望作家拿出伟大的货色来，问他是不是1957年就可以拿出来。作家也希望批评家写出伟大的论文，既不教条主义，又能指导创作方向，既不一棍打死，又有鞭策作用，也问他是否1957年就拿出示范性的文章来。于是这两位朋友相顾一笑，似乎互相会意：我们不容许偷懒，也不能操之过急呀。
    近年来，虽然没有人指出哪几部作品是不朽的杰作，或者划时代的伟大作品，但佳作还是不少。
    今天，我们有权利要求杰作，要求出现曹雪芹第二，鲁迅第二，要求出现更多的茅盾和老舍。然而我们也不要忽略了，杰作有其物质基础，不会呼之即来的。
    今天我们的基本问题是著作问题。佳作是从著作中选出来的，杰作是从佳作中比出来的。佳作是杰作的基础，著作是佳作的基础。今天，我们的著作不是多，而是少；不是百花放得够了，而是放得不够。正因为如此，党才号召百花齐放。
    正如同我国目前需要更多的科学家，我国也需要更多的艺术家。作家不是太多，而是太少。去年2月28日，巴巴耶夫斯基向几百位中国作家说，中国作家的人数太少，这和中国的国际地位是不相称的。
    苏联有多少作家呢？在1954年12月，苏联有三千六百九十五位作家协会会员。
    在任何时代，任何国家，杰作从不会太多；伟大作家也是不多的。唐人万首绝句，虽是选过的作品，也并非每首都是佳作，而迄今传诵的杰作更是为数不多。唐代诗人辈出，而李、杜、高、王、元、白等人也是少见的。即以李、杜而论，也不是他们的每首诗都是杰作，都像“花间一壶酒”和“剑外忽传收蓟北”那样地千古传诵。
    英国只有一个莎士比亚；列宁认为欧洲无与伦比的俄国小说家也只有一个列夫·托尔斯泰。莎士比亚的作品，有杰作与佳作之分，而九十册的列夫·托尔斯泰全集中，作为杰作的，也不过几种。
    我绝对没有认为建立工厂是轻而易举的糊涂思想。我觉得，出现一个伟大作家，一部不朽杰作，并不比建立工厂更容易，有时甚至更难。英国的工厂以千、万计，但英国的狄更斯、拜仑等人毕竟数不上一百；苏联的最现代化的工厂也以千、万计，而写静静的顿河的萧洛霍夫、写青年近卫军的法捷耶夫一类作家，也不很多的。
    我们百花齐放的政策才开始执行，便伸手要杰作，假如没有“将你一军”的意思，也说得上是急躁情绪了。
    我们要杰作，首先要有佳作。我们要佳作，首先要有著作。我们的问题，首先是繁荣创作。要百花齐放，才见万紫千红；要群芳争妍，才看得出花中魁首。桃花刚开，就要吃桃子，这是不切实际的要求。
    但繁荣创作，不是片面追求数量，容许粗制滥造；而提出时间、条件，也不是守株待兔；只是一般地说，繁荣创作是杰作的更可靠的基础。周恩来总理在“关于知识分子问题的报告”里正确地指示过“质量一般地也只能在一定的数量的基础上产生。”
    时代的进步，使我们能够希望，在一百种著作中，会比过去有更多的佳作，在五十种佳作里，会比过去有更多的杰作。谁在选，谁在比？除了批评家，还有成千成万的读者。
