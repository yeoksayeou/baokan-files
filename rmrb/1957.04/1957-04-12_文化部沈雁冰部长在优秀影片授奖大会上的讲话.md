This is a victory celebration. Representatives of film workers from all over the country, especially those including progressive film workers from Hong Kong, are gathering together for the first time. This is unprecedented in the history of Chinese cinema. The development path and creative direction of the film industry over the past seven years have been basically correct, and the achievements are the main aspect. The state has given honors and rewards to sixty-nine outstanding films and the main creators of these outstanding films. It is hoped that film workers will strive to create more and better socialist national films.

　　Today, we are all very excited to hold a historically significant gathering here: Representatives of film workers from all over the country, especially those including progressive film workers from Hong Kong, are gathering together in Beijing for the first time to receive honors and rewards from the state and the people. This is a glorious and meaningful conference for Chinese film workers, and it is also a brilliant page that has never been seen in the history of Chinese cinema, and is worthy of everyone's eternal commemoration.

　　Therefore, today's conference is a victory celebration and also a unity conference for film workers.

　　New China has been established for seven years. Over the past seven years, the Chinese people have united and, under the leadership of the great Communist Party of China, have marched forward towards socialist construction and have achieved brilliant victories.

　　Under the correct leadership and enthusiastic care of the Party and the government, New China's film industry has also achieved great success. Only in New China is it possible for film, this most important artistic weapon, to penetrate and popularize so deeply among hundreds of millions of people, and to exert its broadest and greatest educational role. Only in New China is it possible for film art to positively and directly express the struggles and lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers, to promote the materialist and scientific worldview to the people through film, and to introduce the world's most advanced science and technology to the broad masses of the people, so as to improve the people's ideological, scientific, and cultural level.

　　Over the past seven years, various film studios have produced many feature films, news documentaries, science education films, and animated films, and have translated a large number of the world's most outstanding films of various kinds.

　　Film art has made a great contribution to enriching and improving the cultural life of the broad masses of our people.

　　In order to encourage the major achievements already made by film art creators, to encourage their active creative spirit over the years, especially today when the Party has put forward the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom" in the development of artistic creation, and in order to encourage film art creators to better develop creation, prosper creation, improve film quality, and create more and better socialist national new films, to serve socialist construction and to serve workers, peasants, and soldiers, the Ministry of Culture believes that it is necessary to reward the creators of various outstanding films and translated films that were first released nationwide from 1949 to the end of 1955.

　　Based on the spirit mentioned above, after full deliberation and discussion in various aspects, the Ministry of Culture has now decided to give various honorary awards to a group of outstanding films and the main creators of these outstanding films.

　　The feature films that won first prize include "The White Haired Girl," "Steel Warrior," "Dong Cunrui," and "Reconnaissance Across the River," four in total.

　　The feature films produced by private film studios before public ownership that won awards include "Crows and Sparrows," "My Life," and "Two Families' Spring," three in total.

　　Progressive film workers in Hong Kong have produced many meaningful films under various difficult and arduous conditions, and have been welcomed by a wide audience when they were screened domestically. It has now been decided to award "Pearl River Tears," "Peerless Beauty," "Spring," "A Year's Plan," and "A Partition Away," five films in total, with honorary awards.

　　In addition, there are nine award winners for outstanding creators of news films, four award winners for outstanding creators of military science education films, four award winners for outstanding creators of "Science and Technology" magazine films, and a total of thirty-nine award winners for outstanding creators of various translated films (including translated films in ethnic minority languages). Together with the number of award winners for the above outstanding films, there are a total of four hundred and nine award winners. In addition, seventy-two main creators of outstanding films produced in Hong Kong and five outstanding feature documentaries co-produced by China and foreign countries received honorary awards.

　　Here, on behalf of the Ministry of Culture and myself personally, I would like to extend my sincere and warm congratulations to these award-winning comrades, and through you, to all film workers! Congratulations to the progressive film workers far away in Hong Kong!

　　Comrades, the state has given honors and awards to so many films and creators, which is a great and happy event for everyone. This proves that film workers, under the leadership of the Party, have carried out conscious ideological transformation, united as one, and adhered to the policy of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers in the few years after the liberation of the country, and have made significant progress in both ideology and professional skills.

　　This award proves the importance and expectations of the Party and the state for the film industry, and also proves that the development path of film art creation is basically correct and healthy in implementing the direction of film serving workers, peasants, and soldiers.

　　In the award-winning films, the vast majority created real and vivid artistic images; the image of the creators of history—the working people, the brilliant and splendid ordinary people of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

　　For example, in "The White Haired Girl," the legendary and typical fate of Xi'er, a rural woman, fully reveals the irreconcilable and sharp contradictions between peasants and landlords in rural China, and strongly stimulates the class hatred of the broad masses of working people. Hu Xiuzhi in "Daughters of China" and Fu Ruohua in "Storm on the Southern Island" show the growth process of various ordinary women in the Chinese revolutionary struggle, showing how great a force can be generated by the excellent daughters of the Chinese nation once they have mastered their own destiny.

　　"Dong Cunrui" creates a real image of an ordinary soldier, whose vividness, kindness, ease of understanding, and lovability are mainly expressed through the growth process of this soldier. Dong Cunrui's fate reveals the most fundamental characteristics of thousands of People's Liberation Army soldiers: the peasants who longed to be liberated from feudal oppression in China, after being tempered in the national liberation war and becoming proletarian soldiers, will become an invincible army.

　　Other award-winning films, such as "Steel Warrior," "Reconnaissance Across the River," and "Shangrao Concentration Camp," have mostly left us with some unforgettable, real, and moving images.

　　The common characteristics of the award-winning stage art films, "The Butterfly Lovers," "The Heavenly Match," and "Qin Xianglian," are: through the strong legendary nature of the story, they show the people's wishes and fantasies, and praise loyal love and justice in the world; although they are tragedies, they are full of the passion and imagination of the masses, and are full of romanticism and optimism. At the same time, these films are all excellent traditional programs of local operas, they all have rich national characteristics and national style, and their actors all have long-term artistic practice, so they can create vivid and beautiful artistic images. And when they were made into films, the directors gave them a certain creative processing.

　　Animated films are relatively young in our film industry, with a small output, but they have made rapid progress and are a type of film that is very popular among the broad masses. In recent years, after paying more attention to the national characteristics of material selection and artistic expression, there has been particularly significant progress. "Magic Brush" is a very popular work with national style. The animated films "Good Friends" and "Why is the Crow Black" both have novel and pleasing themes, and are also very skilled in terms of technique, and have reached a high level. We hope that there will be more of these animated films to serve children.

　　News documentaries have been produced in large quantities in recent years. Many great struggles that our country has experienced in the past seven years—from the Liberation War to the establishment of New China, to land reform, the Anti-American Aid Korea, socialist transformation and construction, and the unity of all ethnic groups—have been recorded truthfully and movingly. For several years, many news documentary workers have always adhered to this direction: to quickly and truthfully reflect the great changes in our country, and to report in a timely manner on the struggle of our people for socialist construction; in the years of the Liberation War, some news documentary filmmakers even exchanged their own blood and lives for the true record of the war. In such documentaries, artistic truth has become a symbol of the noble fighting spirit of a news film worker, and a sign of wholeheartedly serving the people. We cannot but thank them for leaving us with so many solemn, magnificent, true, and moving historical scenes, such as "Three Years of Liberation War in Northeast China," "A Million Soldiers Cross the Yangtze River," "Anti-American Aid Korea," and "Steel Transport Line," etc. Film art has gloriously and faithfully recorded the development of the history of New China. Preserving these true and moving historical faces is not only an educational role for the broad masses at that time, but also one of the most important tools for educating the younger generation in the future. The important historical significance of the work of news documentary films cannot be ignored in any way. Many excellent news documentaries that truthfully record the development of the motherland are very important and precious historical records of our country, and are very valuable materials and cultural wealth.

　　Our science education films are still a relatively young type of film. In recent years, some films promoting scientific and technological knowledge related to the daily life and production of the masses have been filmed, becoming a powerful tool for spreading materialism and scientific culture. The science education films and "Science and Technology" magazine films awarded this time have played a good role in promoting technological reforms in industry and agriculture, and have been warmly welcomed by workers and peasant masses. The advanced technical methods promoted in many films have been applied in their own production practices in various regions and have achieved good results. This makes science education films more closely integrated with national production and construction.

　　Among the award-winning films, there are also films popularizing scientific knowledge and social education films introducing the operation and management of agricultural cooperatives; the latter is only a new attempt, but it has already been welcomed by the masses. Based on these great achievements that have already been made, and then taking a step forward and expanding the scope and aspects of science education films, we believe that science education films will be an indispensable and important tool in improving the scientific culture, science, and technology level of the broad masses of the people in our country.

　　Finally, it should be particularly pointed out that the various film studios have made great achievements in the translation of films in recent years. Various translated films, including translated films in the languages of ethnic minorities in our country, foreign art films, news documentaries, science education films, military teaching films, and animated films, have played a very important role in the cultural life of our people. This is an extremely important work to improve the ideological, cultural, and scientific level of the broad masses, to strengthen the cultural exchange between the people of our country and the people of other countries, and to promote the development of friendship between the people of all countries. We are serious and earnest about the work of translated films, the quality of the films is very good, and many foreign friends are very interested in our translated films and give them high praise.

　　Comrades, it is necessary for me to briefly explain the above situation. This proves that the development path and creative direction of the film industry over the past seven years are basically correct, and the achievements are the main aspect; it is entirely necessary and fair for the state to give honors and rewards to these outstanding films.

　　However, this award is not enough to prove that there are no shortcomings in our film work; in the process of this award evaluation, we have more clearly seen the serious shortcomings that exist in our work.

　　First of all, the output of each type of film is not large, the quality of the films is not high enough, the subject matter is narrow, and the styles are monotonous. These phenomena exist to varying degrees.

　　For example, because the Chinese revolutionary struggle has gone through a long period of revolutionary war, some creators are also more familiar with this type of subject matter, so there are more films reflecting the subject matter of revolutionary war. The films reflecting the subject matter of war that were selected this time generally have a considerable level. It is very natural and completely understandable that the broad masses of the people love this type of film because they have personally experienced the long life of revolutionary war. There are relatively few films reflecting the new life of workers, peasants, and ethnic minorities in socialist construction, and in terms of artistic creation, they generally do not reach the level of some excellent revolutionary war films. This is a shortcoming that should arouse our serious attention and effort to overcome.

　　Secondly, due to the shackles and influence of dogmatism, some restrictions have been formed on the subject matter of artistic creation, so that the subject matter is not broad enough, so that many creators cannot fully develop their potential. And the situation of low film output and narrow subject matter in the past few years has also affected the fact that many experienced creators engaged in film work did not have the opportunity to win awards in this award evaluation, which we think is very regrettable. Fortunately, this situation has changed somewhat in recent years, especially after the Party put forward the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom," the Film Bureau has already made many improvements in terms of organization and administrative management, in order to resolutely implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom, and a hundred schools of thought contend." Excellent film awards will be held every year in the future, and we believe that in the near future, outstanding creators in all aspects will have the opportunity to receive national awards.

　　In varying degrees, all our types of films have the shortcomings of conceptualization and formulaization, and even some excellent feature films often cannot completely avoid them. The reasons for this situation are complex, such as: the management of artistic production is too centralized, there is too much administrative interference, the influence of dogmatism, and the separation of creators from life, etc. Now, after certain improvements in organization and administrative management, the most urgent task facing us is to study Marxism-Leninism for a long time and persistently, to overcome dogmatism, to go deep into life, and to strengthen ties with workers, peasants, and soldiers. As Comrade Lu Dingyi pointed out in his speech at the inaugural meeting of the various factories and troupes under the Shanghai Film Studio: "Film workers are people who educate others. They must not only learn Marxism in books, but also in practice, that is, to serve workers, peasants, and soldiers wholeheartedly, to become close friends with workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to make long-term and patient efforts for this."

　　Comrades, let me once again warmly congratulate you on your glorious receipt of the state's award, but please also allow me to sincerely remind everyone that this award also expresses the state's and the people's higher expectations and hopes for your future work. I hope that everyone will work hard, implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom," actively overcome shortcomings, create more and better socialist national new films, and serve the great socialist construction of our motherland!

    文化部沈雁冰部长在优秀影片授奖大会上的讲话
    这是一个胜利的庆祝大会。全国各地的电影工作者的代表，特别是包括香港的进步电影工作者的代表，第一次会合在一起。这是中国电影史上从来没有过的。七年来电影事业的发展道路、创作的方向，基本上是正确的，成绩是主要的。国家给予六十九部优秀影片以及这些优秀影片的主要创作人员等以荣誉和奖励。希望电影工作者为创造更多、更好的、社会主义的民族电影而努力。
    今天我们大家非常兴奋地在这里举行一个有历史意义的聚会：全国各地的电影工作者的代表，特别是包括香港的进步电影工作者的代表，第一次会合在一起，来北京接受国家和人民的荣誉的奖励，这是中国电影工作者的一次光荣的、有意义的大会，也是中国电影史上从来没有过的，值得大家永远纪念的光辉的一页。
    所以，今天的大会是一个胜利的庆祝大会，也是电影工作者团结大会。
    新中国已经建立七年了，七年来，中国人民团结一致，在伟大的中国共产党领导下，向社会主义建设大步迈进，取得了辉煌的胜利。
    在党和政府的正确的领导和热情的关怀下，新中国的电影事业也获得了很大的成绩。只有在新中国，电影这一最重要的艺术武器才可能如此深入、普及到亿万人民中去，发挥它最广泛的、最伟大的教育作用；也只有在新中国，电影艺术才有可能正面地直接地来表现工农兵劳动群众的斗争与生活，才有可能通过电影向人民宣传唯物主义的科学的世界观，向广大人民介绍世界上最先进的科学技术，以提高人民的思想、科学、文化水平。
    七年来，各制片厂制作了许多艺术片、新闻纪录片、科学教育片、美术片，并且译制了大量的世界各国最优秀的各种影片。
    电影艺术在丰富和提高我国广大群众的文化生活方面，是有极大贡献的。
    国家为了鼓励电影艺术创作工作者的已经取得的重大成就，为了鼓励他们过去多年来积极的创造精神，尤其是在党提出了发展艺术创作的百花齐放的方针的今天，为了鼓舞电影艺术创作工作者更好地发展创作，繁荣创作，提高影片质量，创造更多的更好的社会主义的民族新电影，来为社会主义建设服务，为工农兵服务，文化部认为给予1949年到1955年底在全国范围首轮上映的各种优秀影片和译制片的创作工作者以奖励，是必要的。
    根据以上所说的这种精神，经过各方面充分的酝酿和讨论，文化部现在决定给予一批优秀影片以及这些优秀影片的主要创作人员以各种荣誉的奖励。
    故事片获得一等奖的有“白毛女”、“钢铁战士”、“董存瑞”、“渡江侦察记”等四部，获得二等奖的有“中华女儿”、“翠岗红旗”、“上饶集中营”、“南岛风云”等四部，获得三等奖的有“新儿女英雄传”、“鸡毛信”、“平原游击队”、“哈森与加米拉”、“草原上的人们”、“伟大的起点”、“六号门”、“丰收”等八部。舞台艺术片获得一、二、三等奖的有“梁山伯与祝英台”、“天仙配”、“秦香莲”三部。
    在公营以前的私营制片厂摄制的故事片获奖的有“乌鸦与麻雀”、“我这一辈子”、“两家春”等三部。
    香港的进步的电影工作者在各种困难艰苦的条件下，摄制了许多有意义的影片，在国内放映时获得广大观众的欢迎；现在决定给予“珠江泪”、“绝代佳人”、“春”、“一年之计”、“一板之隔”等五部影片以荣誉奖。
    新闻纪录片获得一等奖的有“百万雄师下江南”、“解放了的中国”、“中国人民的胜利”、“抗美援朝第一部”、“交换病伤战俘”、“永远怀念苏军”、“战胜怒江天险”等七部
  （长片四部，短片三部），二等奖的有“钢铁运输线”、“东北三年解放战争”、“人民一条心”、“抗战的越南”、“反对细菌战”、“红旗漫卷西风”、“和平万岁”、“1952年国庆节”、“伟大的土地改革”、“踏上生路”、“越南民主共和国政府代表团访问中国第一辑”、“桂林山水”、“画家齐白石”、“在帕米尔高原上”、“救死扶伤的英雄”等十五部（长片九部，短片六部），三等奖的有“大西南凯歌”、“边疆战士”、“一定要把淮河修好”、“八一运动会”、“七一在北平”、“民间美术工艺”、“华而不实”、“在和平建设的岗位上”、“伞兵生活”等九部（长片四部，短片五部）。
    科学教育片获一等奖者有“培育壮秧”、“淡水养鱼”两部，获二等奖者有“玉米人工授粉”、“根治水稻害虫——三化螟”等两部，获三等奖者有“农业生产合作社的包工制”“先进砌砖法”、“水土保持”、“杠杆的作用”。美术片获奖者有“神笔”、“好朋友”、“乌鸦为什么是黑的”等三部。
    此外，新闻片优秀创作人员得奖者有九人，军事科教片优秀创作人员得奖者有四人，“科学与技术”杂志片优秀创作人员得奖者有四人，各种翻译片（包括兄弟民族语言翻译片）优秀创作人员得奖者共有三十九人。连同以上优秀影片得奖人数，共有四百零九人获奖。另外，香港出产优秀影片及我国与外国合制的五部优秀长纪录片的主要创作人员，获得荣誉奖者七十二人。
    在这里，我仅代表文化部和我个人，向这些得奖的同志，致以真诚的、热烈的祝贺，并且通过你们向全体电影工作者祝贺！向远在香港的进步电影工作者祝贺！
    同志们，国家给予这样多影片和创作人员以荣誉和奖励，这是大家感到光荣的一件大喜事，这证明了：电影工作者在全国解放以后的几年时间内，在党的领导下，进行了自觉的思想改造，团结一致，坚持电影为工农兵服务的方针，无论是在思想和业务方面都有了显著的进步。
    这种奖励，证明了党和国家对电影事业的重视和期望，也证明了电影事业在执行电影为工农兵服务的方向上，电影艺术创作的发展道路基本上是正确的、健康的。
    在获奖的影片中，极大部分创造了真实的、生动的艺术形象；历史的制造者——劳动人民群众、工农兵的光辉的灿烂的普通人的形象。
    例如“白毛女”，喜儿的富有传奇性、又是极有典型意义的农村妇女的命运，就充分揭示出中国农村中农民和地主阶级不可调和的尖锐的矛盾，强烈地激发了广大劳动人民的阶级仇恨。“中华女儿”中的胡秀芝、“南岛风云”中的符若华表现了中国革命斗争中各种普通妇女的成长过程，显示了中华民族的优秀女儿一旦掌握了自己的命运之后，就会产生怎样伟大的力量。
  “董存瑞”创造了一个真实的普通战士的形象，其生动、亲切、易于理解和令人喜爱等等优点，主要是通过这个战士的成长过程而表现出来的。董存瑞的命运正揭示出千千万万人民解放军战士的最根本的特质：中国渴望自封建压迫下获得解放的农民，在民族解放战争中获得锻炼成为无产阶级的战士之后，就将成为一支战无不胜的军队。
    其他获奖的影片，如“钢铁战士”、“渡江侦察记”、“上饶集中营”等，大都为我们留下了一些难忘的真实动人的形象。
    获奖的舞台艺术片，“梁山伯与祝英台”、“天仙配”、“秦香莲”的共同特点是：通过故事的强烈的传奇性，显示了人民的愿望和幻想，歌颂了忠贞的爱情和人间的正义；尽管是悲剧，但是充满了人民群众的激情和想像，富于浪漫主义、乐观主义的色彩。同时，这些影片又都是地方戏曲的优秀的传统节目，它们都有丰富的民族色彩和民族风格，它们的演员都有长期的艺术实践，所以能够创造了生动美妙的艺术形象。而在摄制为影片时，导演又曾给以一定的创造性的加工。
    美术片在我们电影事业中是比较年青的，产量较少，但进步较快，很受广大群众的喜爱的一个片种。最近几年来更加注意到选材与艺术表现的民族色彩之后，尤其有显著的进步。“神笔”就是具有民族风格很受欢迎的作品。动画片“好朋友”与“乌鸦为什么是黑的”，题材都新颖可喜，在技巧方面也显得十分熟练，已经达到较高的水平，我们希望有更多的这样的美术片为儿童们服务。
    新闻纪录片，几年来产量不少。我们国家在七年来所经历的许多伟大的斗争——从解放战争到新中国的建立，到土地改革、抗美援朝、社会主义的改造和建设、各民族的团结，几乎毫无遗漏地被留下了真实、动人的纪录。几年以来，许多新闻纪录片的工作者始终坚持这一个方向：迅速而真实地反映我国伟大的变化，及时地报道我国人民为社会主义建设的斗争；在解放战争的年代，有的新闻纪录电影工作者甚至以自己的鲜血和生命来换取得战争的真实纪录。在这样一些纪录片中，艺术的真实已经成了一个新闻电影工作者崇高的战斗精神，全心全意为人民服务的一个标志了。我们不得不感谢他们为我们留下这许多庄严的、壮丽的、真实动人的历史场面，如“东北三年解放战争”、“百万雄师下江南”、“抗美援朝”、“钢铁运输线”等等。电影艺术光荣地、忠实地记载了新中国历史的发展。保留了这些真实动人的历史面貌，不但是在当时起了教育广大群众的作用，就是在今后，也还是教育青年一代的最重要的工具之一。新闻纪录影片的工作的重要的历史意义是不能有任何忽视的，许多优秀的真实地记载祖国发展的新闻纪录片，是我们国家非常重要的宝贵的历史纪录，是非常可宝贵的资料和文化财富。
    我们的科学教育片还是一个比较年青的片种。在最近几年中，拍摄了一些与群众日常生活和生产有关的宣传科学技术知识的影片，成为传播唯物主义思想和科学文化的有力工具。这次所奖励的几部科教片和“科学与技术”杂志片，在推进工业和农业的技术改革中，都起了良好的作用，受到了工人和农民群众的热烈欢迎。许多影片中所推广的先进技术方法，在各地区都曾经被运用在自己生产的实践中，得到了良好的效果。这就使得科教片与国家生产建设更加密切地结合起来。
    在得奖影片中还有普及科学知识的影片与介绍农业合作社经营管理的社会性的教育片；后者还只是一种新的尝试，但已经获得群众的欢迎。在这些已经获得很大成就的基础上再前进一步，再扩大科学教育片的拍摄范围与方面，我们相信，科学教育影片在提高我国广大人民的科学文化、科学技术水平方面，将是一个不可缺少的重要工具。
    最后，应该特别指出来，各个制片厂几年来在翻译片工作方面是有很大的功绩的。各种译制片，包括我国少数民族语言翻译片，外国的艺术片、新闻纪录片、科教片、军事教学片、美术片，对于我国人民的文化生活，起了非常重要的作用；这是提高广大群众思想、文化、科学水平、加强我国人民与其他国家人民的文化交流、促进各国人民的友谊发展的一个极为重要的工作。我们对译制片的工作是认真的、严肃的，影片质量很好，许多外国的朋友们都对我们的译制片感到很大的兴趣，并且给予很高的评价。
    同志们，我简单地说明一下以上这些情况是必要的，这证明了七年来电影事业的发展道路、创作的方向，基本上是正确的，成绩是主要的；国家给予这些优秀的影片以荣誉和奖励是完全必要的，也是公允的。
    但是，这种奖励并不足以证明，我们电影工作不存在缺点；在这次的评奖过程中，更清楚地看到我们工作中所存在的严重缺点。
    首先是各个片种的产量都不多，影片质量不够高，题材范围窄狭，式样单调，这些现象都是程度不同地存在着。
    例如由于中国革命斗争是经过长期的革命战争的，有些创作人员也比较熟悉这方面的题材，因而反映革命战争题材的影片就比较多。此次入选的反映战争题材的影片一般都具有相当的水平。广大群众由于亲身经历过长期的革命战争的生活，非常喜爱这类影片，是很自然的，完全可以理解的。反映工人农民和少数民族在社会主义建设中的新生活题材的影片就比较少了，在艺术创作上一般说来还达不到某些优秀的革命战争片的水平。这是应该引起我们严重注意、努力克服的缺点。
    其次，由于教条主义的束缚与影响，形成对于艺术创作题材的某些限制，以致题材不广阔，从而使得许多创作者还不能充分发挥各自的潜力。而前几年的影片产量少、题材窄狭的情况，也影响到许多从事电影工作富有经验的创作人员在这次评奖中没有获奖的机会，这是我们认为十分遗憾的。幸而近年来，这种情况已有所改变，特别是党提出百花齐放的方针之后，电影事业管理局已经从组织上、行政管理上作了许多改进，以期坚决贯彻百花齐放，百家争鸣的方针。今后每年都要举行优秀影片的评奖，我们相信，在不久的将来，各方面的优秀创作人员获得国家奖励的机会，一定会有的。
    我们各个片种在不同程度上，都存在着概念化和公式化的缺点，甚至在一些优秀的故事片中也往往不能完全避免。造成这种情况的原因是复杂的，例如：艺术生产上的管理过于集中、行政干涉过多、教条主义的影响、创作人员的脱离生活等等。现在，经过组织、行政管理工作的某些改进以后，摆在我们面前的最迫切的任务就是要长期地、坚持马克思列宁主义的学习，克服教条主义，深入生活、加强与工农兵的联系。正如陆定一同志在上海电影制片公司所属各厂、团成立大会上讲话中所指出的：“电影工作者是教育别人的人，自己不但在书本上，并且要在实践中学习马克思主义，这就是要全心全意为工农兵服务，同工农兵结成知心朋友，要为此作长期的耐心的努力。”
    同志们，让我再一次热烈地祝贺你们光荣地获得国家的奖励，但也请允许我真诚地提醒大家，这种奖励也是表示国家和人民对你们今后的工作有更高的期待和希望。希望大家努力，贯彻百花齐放的方针，积极克服缺点，创造出更多、更好的、社会主义的民族新电影，为我们祖国伟大的社会主义建设服务！
