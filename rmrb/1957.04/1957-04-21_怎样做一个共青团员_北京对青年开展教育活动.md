    怎样做一个共青团员
    北京对青年开展教育活动
    据新华社20日讯　“怎样做一个共青团员”的教育活动，正在北京市各级团组织中积极展开。工业、商业、手工业等方面和大、中学校的团组织，以及团的各区委和基层团委，都在对团员和青年积极分子进行这方面的团课教育。团丰台区委并举办了农村方面的团课示范报告。
    许多团组织在开展教育活动时运用了多种多样的方式。北京印刷厂、女二中等单位团委，组织团员阅读4月1日中国青年报“准备好：做一个共青团员！”的社论，召开团员座谈会。北京师范大学团委会要求团员同时学习毛主席的“纪念白求恩”、“为人民服务”等文章。男一中团委组织全校团员学习“不死的王孝和”。电车公司第三保养厂、男一中等单位团委根据本单位情况，分别对团员提出了以“增产节约”、“为集体做一件好事”的实际行动来迎接团的第三次全国代表大会，迎接改名。
    目前“共青团员”这一光荣称号已经在鼓舞着和教育着团员们。北京石油学院采油专业五六、二班团支部全体团员向团委提出保证说：“我们决不玷污团的荣誉，在日常生活中，一定要用实际行动来实现团对我们的希望”。
