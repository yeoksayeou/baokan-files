On April 22, 1956, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region was formally established, and today marks its first anniversary. While celebrating this with auspicious flowers, I will give a brief account of the achievements, shortcomings, and errors in our work over the past year, as well as the tasks that should be completed in the future.

Since the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, not only have various directly affiliated organs, base-level offices, and Dzong-level offices been gradually established, but also, in religious affairs, in order to implement the central government's policy of freedom of religious belief, protect temples, unite all denominations, and strengthen unity, the Religious Affairs Committee and the mass organization of religious believers—the Tibet Branch of the Buddhist Association of China—have also been established. These are all achievements in laying the foundation for building a politically and religiously thriving autonomous regime in Tibet. Similarly, in terms of economic and cultural construction, many primary and secondary schools have been established, with an enrollment of over six thousand students. In terms of medical and health care, free treatment has been provided to all people and livestock in agricultural and pastoral areas, and many mobile medical teams have been organized. In terms of transportation, not only have several highways been built and are under construction in the Tibetan region, but also two air routes from Beijing to Lhasa and one to India have been opened, making air and ground transportation very convenient. In terms of industrial construction, five small-scale factories and mines, represented by the Lhasa Hydropower Plant, have been built and are under construction in the Tibetan region, and some have already been put into production. In order to develop agriculture and animal husbandry, interest-free loans have been issued, and a large number of agricultural implements have been transported from the interior of the motherland. Over the past year, mainly due to the correct leadership, assistance, and care of the Chinese Communist Party, the great leader Chairman Mao, and the State Council, as well as the support of the people of all ethnic groups, the close help and efforts of the People's Liberation Army and cadres stationed in Tibet, and the joint struggle of the monks and laypeople of Tibet, corresponding results have been achieved in the development of Tibet's construction.

While achieving the above results, some shortcomings and errors have also occurred. For example, some of the resolutions passed by the Standing Committee of the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region were not in line with the specific conditions of Tibet and could not be implemented due to the lack of necessary conditions, and various errors occurred due to the imperfect organization of relevant organs. In particular, when the Tibetan Cadre School and various localities recruited students as training targets for cadres, some issues were not explained in detail to the lower levels to obtain their consent, thus creating the impression of being assigned corvée labor, which not only failed to win people's hearts but also failed to achieve the intended purpose due to inappropriate targets. In addition, some newly arrived Han cadres, due to a lack of understanding of the situation in Tibet, have made the mistake of not respecting customs and habits. A few Tibetan cadres also have the shortcomings of not loving their work and lacking a strong sense of responsibility. We have already begun to correct these shortcomings and errors and must continue to gradually overcome them completely in the future.

Among the tasks we should accomplish in the future, not only must we correct past shortcomings and errors, but we should also adjust, improve, and consolidate the various organs affiliated with the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. The Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region should ensure that all its work, large and small, including the implementation of the policy of freedom of religious belief and the protection of temples, is conducive to the development of Tibet and beneficial to the broad masses of the people. The monks and laypeople of Tibet should also closely guard against all kinds of rumors, enhance the unity between the Han and Tibetan nationalities, and strive to promote the improvement of the economy, culture, and people's lives in all aspects, as well as promote the prosperity of the cause in the political sphere. More importantly, the only fundamental source of all interests and happiness—Buddhism, which even Tibetan children who have just learned to speak feel that they can never be separated from—must be promoted and enhanced at all times and in all places. May everyone undertake the task of building a prosperous politically and religiously thriving Tibet!

    愿大家承担起完成建设政教昌隆的西藏的任务
    达赖喇嘛
    1956年4月22日西藏自治区筹备委员会正式成立，到今天满一周岁。在这撒布吉祥花朵来举行庆祝的同时，我把一年来工作中的成绩、缺点和错误，以及今后应该完成的任务，在这里作一个简单的叙述。
    西藏自治区筹备委员会成立以后，不但逐步成立了各直属机关，各基巧级办事处和宗级办事处；在宗教方面，为了执行中央制订的信教自由政策、保护寺庙、联络一切宗派、增强团结等有关宗教的任务，还成立了宗教事务委员会和宗教徒的群众组织——中国佛教协会西藏分会。这些都是在建设政教昌隆的西藏自治政权的奠基工作中的成绩。同样，在经济和文化建设方面，成立了许多中小学校，先后入学人数已经超过六千。在医药卫生方面，对农牧区所有人畜，普遍进行免费治疗，并组织了很多巡回医疗队。在交通方面，不仅在西藏地区已经修成和正在修筑着几条公路，还开辟了两条北京到拉萨的航路和去印度的航路，使空中和地面的交通，都成为十分方便。在工业建设方面，西藏地区已经建成和正在修建以拉萨水力发电厂为代表的五所小型厂矿，有些已经投入生产。为了发展农牧业，发放了农牧业无息贷款，并从祖国内地运来了大批农具。一年以来，主要由于中国共产党、伟大领袖毛主席和国务院的正确领导、帮助和关怀，也由于各族人民的支援，进藏人民解放军和干部的亲切帮助和努力，西藏僧俗人民的共同奋斗，在发展西藏的建设工作中，获得了相应的成果。
    在获得上述成果的同时，也发生了一些缺点和错误。例如：自治区筹委会常务委员会先后通过的决议当中，有些不符合于西藏的具体情况，因为条件不具备而无法实施，由于有关机关的组织不健全而发生各种错误。尤其是西藏干部学校和各地在招收作为培养干部对象的学员的时候，有些问题未曾经过详细向下面说明情况，取得他们同意，因此造成了似乎是在派差，弄得既不能得人心，又因对象不当而达不到目的。此外有些少数新来的汉族干部，由于不了解西藏的情况，发生不尊重风俗习惯的缺点和错误。少数藏族干部，也有不热爱自己的工作和责任心不强的缺点。现在已经开始改正这些缺点和错误，今后还必须继续逐步完全加以克服。
    在今后我们应该完成的任务中，不仅对于过去的缺点和错误必须加以改正，对于西藏自治区筹委会所属各个机关，还应该加以调整、改进和巩固。自治区筹委会执行信教自由政策以及保护寺庙等所有一切大小工作，都应该做到有利于西藏的发展和有利于广大人民。西藏僧俗人民，也应该严密提防种种谣言，增进汉、藏民族之间的团结，既要从各方面去促使经济、文化和人民生活的提高，又要从政治方面促进事业趋于繁荣，更重要的是一切利益和安乐的唯一根本——连刚会说话的藏地儿童都觉得永远不能分离的佛教，要使之随时随地发扬光大。愿大家承担起建设政教昌隆的西藏的任务！
