A Middle School Student's Diary

    Editor's Note: Zhao Shaodi, a senior high school student in Beijing, sent us a letter. In it, he said, "My classmate He Ming let me read his diary and asked me for advice." He also attached excerpts from the diary. These diary entries raise an important question: What attitude should cadres have towards their children's enrollment in higher education and employment? How should children deal with their parents' incorrect attitudes? This question is of universal concern to both parents and children. We are now publishing excerpts from this student's diary below. This student's father clearly has very wrong views on the issue of his children's enrollment in higher education and participation in production labor. It is the common responsibility of every reader to help those who hold the same views as this student's father to change their incorrect views.
    
    February 28
    This semester, my father has been very strict with me. Last Sunday, the whole family went to the movies, but he left me behind to review my lessons, saying he was afraid I wouldn't pass the university entrance exam.
    
    March 2
    My father is becoming increasingly strict with me. He called me in today and said, "You must work hard and get into university. Once you become a university student, you'll have everything you want." I said, "I will definitely work hard to strive for it..." "Strive! Strive! Don't give me that. No matter what you say about employment or self-study, I will never let you take up employment. I've been making revolution for more than ten years, saving every penny to send you to school. Is it so you can go wield a hoe and feed pigs? You better watch out." I couldn't do my homework anymore today. I kept thinking about my father's words.
    
    March 10
    My father often gets angry with me because of the university entrance exam. My mother also wants me to prepare well for the exam so as not to make my father angry. Today, my father lost his temper and said that if I didn't get into university, he wouldn't want me as his son anymore. ...
    
    April 10
    I am extremely distressed. After dinner tonight, my father said, "Don't always look so worried. You need to have confidence. The newspapers are calling on graduates to take up employment, but that's aimed at the children of workers and peasants. You think, most of them can't afford to go to university. If they do, they rely on state subsidies. It just so happens that factories and rural areas need a large number of laborers, so let them take up employment. But you are different. Your father is a bureau chief. What is there to fear about not being able to afford your university education?" My father smiled smugly: "Once you graduate from university, your future will be bright, just like your father... Haha! That's my good son, you will inherit your father's glorious revolutionary cause..." I really couldn't listen anymore. I ran out into the street and sat in a quiet place for a long, long time. I thought, I love my father, and I respect him, but my father's idea of looking down on labor and the working people really makes me feel pained. I am a member of the Communist Youth League. How can I convince my father?

    一个中学生的日记
    编者按：北京市的一个中学高中三年级的学生赵绍迪寄来一封信。他在信里说：“我的同学何明把一本日记让我看，并让我出个主意。”他的信中还附来日记的摘录。这些日记中提出了一个重要的问题——干部对待子女的升学和就业应该抱什么样的态度？子女对待父母的不正确态度应该怎么办？这个问题是做父母的和做子女的都普遍关心的问题。我们现在从这位学生的日记中摘出几段发表在下面。这个学生的爸爸显然对于子女的升学和参加生产劳动的问题存在着非常错误的看法。应该怎样帮助跟这个学生的爸爸抱着相同观点的人们改变错误的观点，这是每一个读者的共同责任。

    这学期爸爸对我要求很严格。星期日全家去看电影，他只把我留下复习功课，说是怕我考不上大学。
    3月2日
    爸爸对我越发严厉了，今天把我叫去。他说：“你必须努力，一定要上大学，等你成了大学生，要什么有什么。”我说：“我一定努力争取……”“争取！争取！别跟我来这一套，什么就业呀、自学呀，说什么我也不能叫你就业。我革命十几年，省吃俭用供你上学，是为了叫你去把大锄，去喂母猪吗？你给我小心点。”今天的功课再也做不下去了，我老是想着爸爸的话。
    3月10日
    为了升大学的事，爸爸经常生我的气。妈妈也要我好好准备升大学，别让爸爸生气。今天爸爸发了火，说我要考不上大学，他就不要我这个儿子了。……
    4月10日
    我苦恼极了。今天晚饭后，爸爸说：“你别老愁眉苦脸的，要有信心，报纸上号召毕业生就业，那是针对工、农子弟说的。你想，他们大多数念不起大学，要念也是依靠国家补助，正好工厂、农村需要大批劳动力，就让他们就业吧。而你就不同了，爸爸是局长，还怕供不起你上大学？”爸爸得意地笑着：“等你大学一毕业，前途就远大了，像爸爸一样，……哈哈！这才是爸爸的好儿子，要继承爸爸光荣的革命事业……。”我实在听不下去了，跑到街上，在一个僻静的地方坐了很久很久。我想，我爱爸爸，而且尊敬爸爸，但是爸爸这种看不起劳动和劳动人民的思想，真使我感到痛苦。我是个青年团员，我怎样去说服爸爸呢？
