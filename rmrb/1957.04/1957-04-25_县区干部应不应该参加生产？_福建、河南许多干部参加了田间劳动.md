Should County and District Cadres Participate in Production?
Fujian and Henan Many Cadres Participated in Field Labor
Editor's Note: Most people already have no doubts about the fact that commune cadres should participate in productive labor. Should county and district cadres also participate in productive labor? Judging from the news from Longxi and Xuchang areas, it is very beneficial for county and district cadres to participate in productive labor when they go to the countryside. However, as we understand it, some comrades still have different opinions on this issue. Some people think: although this is beneficial to the agricultural cooperatives where the county and district cadres participate in production, it may not be beneficial to improving the work of the entire county and district; even without participating in field production, they can still contact the masses and understand the specific situation, and even have more time to contact more masses and understand more situations; if they are not fixed in one place to participate in production, meddling here and there, and they are very unfamiliar with productive labor, it may not be beneficial to production, but may affect the normal production order of the cooperative. Are these opinions correct? We hope everyone will discuss this issue. County and district cadres who have already participated in production, how have they improved the leadership of the work of the entire county and district, what experiences do they have, what difficulties do they have, we also hope you will write and send them to us.

(Reported by this newspaper) County, district, and township cadres in the Longxi area of Fujian Province have universally participated in field production, improving their leadership style. Shen Shanshui, deputy secretary of the Nan靖 County Party Committee, carried manure with the farmers; Lin Kezhi, deputy county magistrate of Shaoan County, helped the masses to build water conservancy projects; Cai Zhengnan, deputy secretary of the Guxian District Committee of Longxi County, and Zeng Xinghua, deputy secretary of the District Committee of the Communist Youth League, took manure baskets to the fields to inspect production, learning about the production situation of the cooperative in one day and also picking up more than 60 catties of manure. They set an example for township and cooperative cadres and gave great encouragement to the masses. Some cooperative members said: "Such cadres are like the cadres during the land reform!" It is even more common for township cadres to take off their shoes and go into the fields. After the party branch secretary and township head of Xibian Township in Nan靖 County returned from the county meeting, they tore up the playing cards that had separated them from the masses, participated in cooperative production, and took the lead in jumping into the deepest part of the water to build water conservancy projects. Many farmers said: This county meeting is more effective than taking tonics! The families of the township cadres also said: The meeting held by the government this time is really good, people have changed! The township cadres also said: Now it has changed from being angry with three heads to being satisfied with three heads! According to incomplete statistics from four counties, Nan靖, Longxi, Haicheng, and Hua'an, among the 702 county and district cadres working in the countryside, 495 have gone deep into the fields and become one with the masses, accounting for 70% of the total. According to statistics from five counties, Taichang, Longxi, etc., among the more than 2,200 main township cadres, 80.6% have gone deep into the fields to lead production.

With the transformation of the cadre's work style, a new atmosphere has emerged in rural work.

After the cadres went to the fields to produce, they greatly increased the production enthusiasm of the masses, making the spring plowing and production quickly form a climax. After Lin Kezhi, deputy county magistrate of Zhao'an County, participated in the construction of the reservoir, the number of migrant workers building the reservoir suddenly increased from 60 to 200, and the original plan to complete the project in one month was completed in only one week. The masses in 刈zai Township, Nan靖 County, originally had low labor enthusiasm, and the attendance rate was only 50%. After Lai Rongde, the deputy county magistrate working in the township, personally went to the fields to carry manure with the masses, a large-scale production movement was launched, and the attendance rate in the township increased to more than 90%.

Due to the change in the leadership methods and work styles of the cadres, many problems existing in production and other work were discovered and resolved in a timely manner. Zhou Shunmin, head of the Cooperation Department of the Haicheng County Party Committee, visited old farmers in Dongsihu Township while leading production and worked with them to study and solve many production technology problems. Cadres in Dongtou Township found that some cooperative members of Qunming Cooperative were short of food while going deep into production, so they helped the cooperative's management committee carefully calculate and pre-pay more than 9,200 catties of grain, lending it to 44 households in difficulty, so that they could concentrate on production. After the township cadres helped Qunhui Cooperative make specific arrangements for labor, they have drawn a part of the labor force to carry out sideline production to help cooperative members overcome the difficulties of the spring famine.

After the cadres corrected their past shortcomings in production, the masses were very considerate to them. For example, after the cadres of Dazhai Township, Longxi County, participated in production, the cooperative members always asked them to leave work early and rest early, saying that they were not used to labor and had to take it slowly. After the township head of Dongshan Township participated in production, the cooperative members always asked him to work nearby, fearing that someone would look for him and it would be inconvenient and delay the work.

The Longxi Prefectural Party Committee believes that at present, a large part of the cadres going to the fields is only to actively take the lead in promoting production, and many people have not realized that this is a leadership method to go deep into the masses, discover problems in a timely manner, and study problems. Therefore, this work style is not very solid. After cadres participate in field labor, they must also improve the work system. County, district, and township cadres always have many official duties to handle, so what should they do? Some adopt the method of rotating duty, some adopt the method of going to the fields in the morning and working in the afternoon and evening or doing public work one day in two days. What is the best way to do it still needs to be specifically studied. How to deal with the work points earned by cadres participating in labor also needs to be studied and resolved.

(Reported by this newspaper) The transformation of the work style of cadres in the Xuchang area of Henan Province has greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the masses. A total of 1,490 cadres were transferred from the directly subordinate agencies of the county to strengthen the grassroots leadership in various counties in the region. The vast majority of cadres can achieve "three togethers (eating, living, and working with the masses) and three deeps (going deep into the fields, going deep into the breeding rooms, and going deep into the homes of cooperative members)" after going to the countryside. In the rural work cadres, a new atmosphere of taking the lead in production has generally emerged. Many township and cooperative cadres have sold their bicycles, carried manure baskets, self-reported labor days, and reduced work point subsidies. The masses reflected: "The cadre's work style has greatly changed, and old and young cooperative members are working together." "What kind of seed grows what kind of seedling, what kind of melon is cut what kind of gourd. In the past, cadres rotated in the cooperative, and cooperative members rotated in the fields, only rotating but not producing; now big and small cadres are working together, how can the masses not work?"

The transformation of the work style of the vast number of township and cooperative cadres is inseparable from the leading and exemplary role of certain leading cadres. For example, among the 24 county committee members of Changge County, except for the 16 members who have special tasks, the remaining 16 members are responsible for 10 key points. Li Yuxian, deputy secretary of the county party committee, found that the attendance rate of cooperative members in Shuangmiao Township was only 40%, so he made arrangements on the one hand and personally helped the masses to deliver manure on the other hand. Many cooperative cadres could not sit still, which affected the masses, and the attendance rate quickly increased to 92%.

In the spring plowing and production, many agricultural cooperatives have implemented contracting work and production, appropriately decentralizing some management and operation rights to the production teams, changing the problem of excessive centralization in the management of the cooperatives. The masses are also very satisfied with this.

    县区干部应不应该参加生产？
    福建、河南许多干部参加了田间劳动
    编者按　社干部要参加生产劳动，这一点大多数人已经没有什么疑问了。县区干部是不是也应该参加生产劳动呢？从龙溪地区和许昌地区的消息看来，县区干部下乡的时候，参加生产劳动也是有很大好处的。但是，据我们了解，有些同志对于这个问题还有不同的意见。有人认为：这样做虽然对于县区干部在那里参加生产的农业社有好处，可是对于改进全县全区的工作未必有好处；不参加田间生产，也同样可以联系群众、了解具体情况，甚至可以有更多时间接触更多的群众，了解更多的情况；如果他们不是固定在一个地方参加生产，这里插一手，那里插一脚，加以他们在生产劳动方面很生疏，可能对生产并没有好处，反而影响社里的正常的生产秩序。这些意见是不是正确呢？希望大家来讨论一下这个问题。已经参加生产的县区干部，怎样改进了对全县全区工作的领导，有些什么经验，有些什么困难，也希望写出来寄给我们。
    本报讯　福建龙溪地区的县、区、乡干部普遍地参加了田间生产，改进了领导作风。中共南靖县委副书记沈山水和农民一起挑大粪；韶安县副县长林克治帮助群众修水利；龙溪县古县区的区委副书记蔡正南和青年团区工委副书记曾兴化，带粪箕下田检查生产，一天中既了解了社的生产情况，又拾了六十多斤粪。他们给乡、社干部树立了榜样，给群众很大的鼓舞。有些社员说：“这样的干部，就像土改时候的干部一样了。”乡干部脱鞋下田的更是普遍。南靖县溪边乡的党支书和乡长从县里开完会回去以后，就把曾经使他们脱离群众的扑克牌撕掉，参加了社里生产，并且带头跳到水最深的地方修水利。很多农民说：这次县里开会比吃补药作用还大！乡干部家里的人也说：政府这次开的会真好，人都变了！乡干部也说：现在是由三头受气变成三头满意了！根据南靖、龙溪、海澄、华安等四个县的不完全统计，在七百零二个下乡工作的县区干部中，深入田间和群众打成一片的有四百九十五人，占总数的70％。另据太长、龙溪、等五个县的统计，在两千二百多个乡主要干部中，深入田间领导生产的占80.6％。
    随着干部作风的转变，农村工作已经出现了新的气象。
    干部下田生产以后，大大地提高了群众的生产积极性，使春耕生产很快就形成高潮。诏安县副县长林克治参加修水库以后，修水库的民工一下子从六十人增至二百人，原计划一个月完工，后来只一个星期就结束了。南靖县刈仔乡原来群众劳动情绪不高，出勤率只达50％。在该乡工作的副县长赖荣德亲自下田和群众一起挑大粪以后，一个规模巨大的生产运动开展起来了，全乡出勤率提高到90％以上。
    由于干部领导方法和工作作风的改变，生产和其他工作上存在的许多问题被及时发现及时解决了。海澄县委合作部长周顺民，在东泗乡领导生产中，登门访问了老农，同他们一起研究和解决了许多生产技术上的一些问题。东头乡干部在深入生产中，发现群明社有一部分社员缺口粮，就帮助社里的管委会精打细算，先预支出九千二百多斤谷子，借给四十四户困难户，使他们能安心生产。群惠社经过乡干部帮助具体安排劳力以后，已抽出一部分劳力进行副业生产，帮助社员克服春荒困难。
    干部在生产中改正了过去的缺点以后，群众对他们十分体贴。例如龙溪县大寨乡干部参加生产以后，社员总是叫他们早下工、早休息，说他们劳动不习惯了，得慢慢来。东山乡乡长参加生产后，社员总叫他在近处劳动，怕有人找他不方便误了工作。
    龙溪地委认为：目前，干部下田，很大一部分还只是为了积极带头推动生产，很多人还没有认识到这是深入群众、及时发现问题、研究问题的领导方法。因此，这种作风还不是很巩固的。干部参加田间劳动以后，还须改进工作制度。县区乡干部总还有许多公事要办，怎么办？有的采取轮流值日的办法，有的采取上午下田、下午晚上办公或两天办一天公的办法。究竟怎样做才好，还需要具体研究。干部参加劳动，所得工分如何处理，这个问题也还需要研究解决。
    本报讯　河南许昌地区干部工作作风的转变，大大鼓舞了群众的生产积极性。全区各县由县直属机关抽调干部一千四百九十名，加强了基层领导。绝大多数干部下乡以后都能作到“三同（与群众同吃、同住、同劳动）、三深入（深入田间、深入饲养室、深入社员家庭）”。在农村工作干部中，普遍出现带头生产的新风气。不少乡、社干部卖掉了自行车，背起了粪篮，自报劳动日，减少工分补助。群众反映：“干部作风大转变，老少社员一齐干。”“啥籽长啥苗，啥瓜锯啥瓢。过去是干部社里转，社员地里转，光转不生产；现在大小干部都干起来了，群众咋不干呢？”
    广大乡、社干部作风的转变，是与某些领导干部的带头和以身作则分不开的。如长葛县二十四个县委委员，除去另有专门任务的以外，其余十六个委员包干负责十个基点。县委副书记李玉宪，在双庙乡发现社员出勤率只有40％，于是一面作了布置，一面亲自帮助群众送粪，很多社干部也坐不住了，从而影响了群众，出勤率很快就提高到92％。
    在春耕生产中，许多农业社实行了包工包产，把一些经营管理权适当下放到生产队改变了社的管理方面过分集中的毛病。群众对这也非常满意。
