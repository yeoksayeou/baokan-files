Among the gifts presented to "Old Fu" at the National Agricultural Exhibition were ten Burmese grape seeds carved with various crops.

China's only Burmese grape tree grows in Xi'an Township, Maoming County, Guangdong. This Burmese grape tree, scientifically known as Pahudia Xylocarpa. Kurz, is 20 meters high, with a crown diameter of 30 meters. Its branches are scattered, leaves are opposite, the leaf shape is oval, the leaf veins are reticulate, and it is evergreen. It blooms in March and April, bears fruit in June and July, and the fruit matures in December. Each pod contains three to seven seeds. The seeds are dark brown and very firm. The base of the seed has a hard woody piece that can be carved with birds, animals, flowers, pavilions, and landscapes, and can also be used to engrave seals. This carving is a unique local handicraft. The flowers and the hard wood on the seeds of the Burmese grape are said to have medicinal properties.

According to local legend, during the Ming Dynasty, a high-ranking official named Li returned to his hometown and brought back a Burmese grape seed obtained in Beijing, which had been brought from Burma. He gave it to his son to play with, but it was later lost. The official suspected that a maid had stolen it and had the maid killed. Soon after, the seed sprouted on the ground and grew into a large tree, as if to vindicate the maid. Some locals regard this tree as sacred, and they burn incense and pray every time they harvest the seeds. However, the seeds produced by this tree do not germinate. Therefore, this is the only tree of its kind in the country. It is said that this tree has been growing for more than 300 years. (Attached image)

    什么是缅茄
    全国农业展览会送给“伏老”的礼品中间，有十颗雕刻着各种农作物的缅茄种子。
    我国唯一的一棵缅茄树生长在广东茂名县西岸乡。这棵缅茄，学名Pahudia Xylocarpa．Kurz，高二十公尺，树冠面直径三十公尺树枝散生，叶对生，叶形椭圆，叶脉网状，常绿。它的开花期在3、4月间，6、7月结实，12月果实成熟。每个果荚里有种子三颗到七颗不等。种子色黑褐，极坚实；种子蒂部有坚硬的木质一块，可以雕刻鸟兽花卉、亭台风景，还可以刻图章。这种雕刻是当地特有的一种手工艺。缅茄的花和种子上的坚硬的木质据说可以入药治病。
    据当地传说，明朝时有个李姓大官还乡，带回在京城得到的由缅甸带入的一颗缅茄种子，交给他的儿子玩，后来忽然遗失了。这个大官怀疑是婢女偷去的，就把这个婢女杀害了。不久，这颗种子在屋地上发了芽，长成了大树，似乎是在为这个婢女洗冤。当地有些人把这棵树看得很神圣，每到采种子的季节，还要烧香祈祷。这棵树所结种子却都不会发芽，因此，这种树在全国只有这么一棵。据说这棵树已经生长了三百多年。（附图片）
