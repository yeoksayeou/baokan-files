Xinhua News Agency, 7th. National supervision organs at all levels have widely launched supervision and inspection activities centered on the production increase and economy practice movement, and have achieved positive results.

Since the Ministry of Supervision held the Sixth National Supervision Work Conference at the end of last December, national supervision organs in various regions have held supervision work conferences to discuss how to give play to the role of supervision work in the production increase and economy practice movement. Subsequently, supervision organs in various regions sent out a large number of cadres to conduct in-depth investigation and research, and then carried out key inspections.

This year, supervision organs in various regions first cooperated with relevant units to conduct a review of the general inventory of materials. They sampled more than 1,200 enterprises and institutions. This review work has now been basically completed. According to the statistics of key sampling by fifteen ministries and nineteen provinces and cities, a total of 108,600 tons of steel, 244,100 cubic meters of wood, 22,900 tons of pig iron, and 23,600 tons of cement were found to be underreported. After inspection, some enterprises have further clarified their "assets," creating favorable conditions for better carrying out the production increase and economy practice movement.

Many supervision organs have inspected the improper arrangements and inadequate designs of some basic construction projects this year. In February of this year, the Tianjin Municipal Supervision Bureau inspected the nine projects with an investment of more than 50,000 yuan each that the Tianjin Municipal Construction Bureau had determined to start construction this year. It was found that the Jinba Minggou and Shaogongzhuang sewer projects were not necessary and should be reduced. After deliberation by the Municipal People's Committee and reassessment by personnel, it has been agreed to reduce them, saving the state more than 1.2 million yuan in investment. Some supervision organs have inspected the waste of raw materials in enterprises. The Supervision Office of Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant, in coordination with the plant's various departments, inspected the waste of raw materials in the plant, and based on the opinions of the masses, put forward many measures to save metal materials. During the inspection, the Supervision Office of Shanghai Machine Tool Plant organized relevant units in the plant to collect and process more than 180 tons of scrap metal.

In order to ensure increased agricultural production in 1957 and strive for a bumper harvest, many supervision organs have recently inspected the preparations for spring plowing. This spring, the Guangdong Provincial Supervision Organs focused on inspecting the preparations for farming in twenty-three townships in eighteen counties and three large reservoir projects, and are currently inspecting the work of spring planting and transplanting. During the inspection of the protection of draught animals, supervision organs in various parts of Shandong Province found that the phenomenon of draught animal deaths was very serious. The Shandong Provincial Supervision Department reported this situation to the provincial leading organs and put forward suggestions on strengthening the protection and breeding of livestock and strictly controlling the approval procedures for slaughter. Now, this suggestion has been adopted, and the phenomenon of draught animal deaths has been reduced. For example, after inspection in Pingyuan County, the county-level leaders have taken effective measures. Since January of this year, the phenomenon of abnormal livestock deaths has been basically eliminated in the county.

    充分发挥国家监察机关在增产节约运动中的作用
    各级监察机关展开监督检查活动
    新华社7日讯　各级国家监察机关以增产节约运动为中心广泛展开监督检查活动，取得了积极的效果。
    从去年12月底监察部举行第六次全国监察工作会议以后，各地国家监察机关都开了监察工作会议，讨论了在增产节约运动中如何发挥监察工作的作用问题。接着，各地监察机关派出大批干部，深入调查研究，然后进行重点检查。
    各地监察机关今年首先协同有关单位对物资库存普查进行了复查工作。它们共抽查了一千二百多个企业单位。这项复查工作现在已经基本结束。据十五个部和十九个省市重点抽查的统计，共发现少报钢材一○·八六万吨，木材二四·四一万立方公尺，生铁二·二九万吨，水泥二·三六万吨。经过检查以后，有些企业的“家底”已经进一步摸清，为更好地开展增产节约运动创造了有利的条件。
    许多监察机关对今年一些基本建设工程项目安排不当和设计不周的情况进行了检查。天津市监察局今年2月间检查了天津市建设局确定在今年动工修建的每项投资额在五万元以上的九项工程，认为其中有津霸明沟、邵公庄下水道两项工程不需要修建，应该削减。后经市人民委员会审议并派人复核后，已同意削减，使国家减少投资一百二十多万元。有些监察机关检查了企业中浪费原材料的情况。太原重型机器厂监察室协同这个厂各科室检查了厂内原材料的浪费情况，并根据群众的意见，提出了许多节约金属材料的措施。上海机床厂监察室在检查时，曾组织厂里有关单位收集并处理了废金属材料一百八十多吨。
    为了保证1957年农业增产，争取大丰收，很多监察机关最近对春耕准备工作进行了检查。广东省监察机关今春在十八个县内重点检查了二十三个乡的备耕工作和三处较大的水库工程，目前又在进行春种插秧工作的检查。山东省各地监察机关在对耕畜保护工作进行检查时，发现耕畜死亡现象很严重。山东省监察厅把这种情况报告给省级领导机关，并提出了加强对牲畜的保护和繁殖、严格宰杀批准手续等建议。现在，这个建议被采纳，耕畜死亡现象减少了。如平原县经检查后，县级领导方面已采取了有效措施。这个县从今年1月开始，牲畜非正常死亡的现象已基本消灭。
