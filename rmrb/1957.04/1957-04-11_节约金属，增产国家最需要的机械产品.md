    Save Metal, Increase Production of Nation's Most Needed Machinery
    *People's Daily* Commentator
    This year, China's machinery industry is facing a new situation: on the one hand, due to the shortage of metal materials, the growth of production has been restricted, and many enterprises have insufficient tasks and their capacity cannot be fully utilized; on the other hand, the variety and quantity of some products cannot meet the needs of various sectors of the national economy. This is a difficult problem in the current development of the machinery industry. Only by carrying out a comprehensive campaign to increase production and practice economy in machinery enterprises, especially by mobilizing the masses of workers to save metal and increase the production of machinery products most needed by the national economy, can we smoothly overcome the difficulties this year and push the machinery industry forward.
    In the past, the efforts of machinery industrial enterprises to increase production and practice economy mostly focused on overcoming obvious waste, such as collecting and utilizing waste materials, saving certain management expenses, etc., which are all important. This year, in addition to continuing to overcome obvious waste, enterprises are required to vigorously improve their technical and organizational management level, and take effective measures in terms of funds, materials, and working hours to implement strict economy, in order to achieve comprehensive economic results. Due to the limitations of materials, the focus of increasing production and practicing economy in machinery enterprises this year is on saving, and the central link is to save metal materials by improving product design and process methods. The vigorous saving of metal materials can enable the national economy to obtain many more mechanical products, which has a great effect on increasing national accumulation and promoting the speed of socialist industrial construction. Therefore, the work of saving metal materials should be regarded as a fundamental policy of socialist industrial construction. Unfortunately, in the past few years, the broad masses of workers in the machinery industry have not given sufficient attention to the issue of saving metal materials. This is mainly reflected in the fact that everyone has not focused on taking technical measures to solve the material problem. In the future, this problem must be actively solved.
    There is great potential to be tapped in machinery enterprises by improving technology to save metal materials. For example, the 30-horsepower diesel engine of the Wuxi Diesel Engine Factory can reduce a quarter of its weight per unit by improving the design structure, saving 420 tons of steel throughout the year. In the first half of 1956, the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory saved a total of 146 tons of steel by improving the manufacturing process and design of its products, which could produce 360 more OM-506 rock drills. It is estimated that it is entirely possible to reduce the weight of heavy machinery, mining machinery, and many machine tools by 10%. Large and complex products such as ships, locomotives, and automobiles have even greater potential for saving metal materials, and there are more aspects that can be worked on. According to the recent preliminary calculation by the Locomotive and Rolling Stock Industry Administration Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building, after adopting measures such as changing design, modifying technical conditions, and improving technology, the enterprises under this bureau are expected to save more than 6,000 tons of steel throughout the year. At present, the average utilization rate of metal materials in enterprises under the First Ministry of Machine Building is only 62%, which means that 38 tons out of 100 tons of steel are cut off! If the utilization rate of materials is improved, coupled with the materials saved by reducing the weight of a single product, many mechanical products can be increased.
    In order to better save metal by improving product design and process methods, and reduce machine weight, it is first necessary to educate the broad masses of technical personnel and production workers to overcome conservative ideas and dogmatic tendencies in this work. The machines surveyed and mapped in our country are often 10%-15% heavier than the actual samples. Why? It is because the designers have increased the safety factor for safety. For example, spheroidal graphite cast iron is not backward in the research of performance in our country, but the promotion is very slow. Why? One of the reasons is that no attention has been paid to solving the technical problems in application. Some technicians always feel that spheroidal graphite cast iron is not as safe as steel. Some enterprise technicians often use the provisions of foreign technical data as an excuse and are unwilling to change the design and organize material substitution. Some production workers are also accustomed to the old process methods and often resist new technologies. These ideological obstacles urgently need to be strengthened and eliminated through education. Of course, any design and process improvements must be analyzed and compared, tested and calculated, and scientific basis must be found to ensure the quality, performance, and economic rationality of the product during use. The quality of products and the economic rationality during use are factors that have a long-term impact on the national economy and need to be paid great attention to.
    The general situation of the machinery industry this year is that the supply of materials is insufficient, so the issue of what to increase production must be carefully considered. At present, some machine products in the plan may have surpluses, while some products cannot meet the needs, and some products are even lacking. This requires industrial management departments to make overall arrangements, do a lot of in-depth work, and strengthen the balance and adjustment of materials and the planning of production. The trial production of new products should be strengthened so as to meet the extensive needs of various sectors of the national economy as much as possible. All products that are needed should be increased in production by all means. Gaps should be filled. Production of products that are expected to be overstocked should be appropriately controlled. In short, the materials saved through hard work should be used to produce the products that the national economy needs most at present. Machinery enterprises should fully develop the ability to produce multiple varieties on a professional basis to meet the diverse needs of the market.
    Extensively mobilizing the masses of workers in the machinery industry and raising their ideological understanding is an extremely important condition for deepening the movement to increase production and practice economy. However, some comrades, seeing certain deviations in the production upsurge and mass movement in 1956, felt that machinery enterprises were not necessarily suitable for carrying out mass movements. This view is not comprehensive. They only saw some minor negative aspects of last year's mass movement in enterprises, and ignored the positive and main aspects of greatly improving production capacity after the masses were mobilized, raised their awareness, and broke through quotas. Denying the movement is also denying the necessity of mobilizing the masses in enterprises, and denying the necessity of the activities of millions of masses to obey a unified political goal, which is of course wrong. The activities of the masses should have a clear political goal at any time. If we forget to mobilize the masses to fight for a specific political goal, we will have no socialist construction. The problem lies in: adapting to the characteristics of the enterprise itself to mobilize the masses, and not taking abnormal methods to impose the mass movement on the enterprise. If, in machinery industrial enterprises, combined with technical transformation and economic accounting, the creative labor of the workers is incorporated into a certain track, and labor emulation is carried out in an orderly manner, it will not only increase production and practice economy, but also promote the improvement of the technical and organizational level of the enterprise. In this way, the movement will meet the requirements of enterprise development. Conversely, if improper methods are adopted, such as working overtime, ignoring quality, disregarding balanced production, eating up work-in-progress, and cutting corners, it will violate the laws of the enterprise itself. As a result, it seems to be increasing production on the surface, but it is actually reducing production; it seems to be saving on the surface, but it is actually wasting. The problem also lies in: having strong and correct leadership throughout the entire movement. In the past, in carrying out movements, we generally paid attention to grasping both ends, that is, mobilization and commendation, while ignoring the inspection and supervision in the process of the movement, and ignoring the timely correction of deviations and the implementation of policies. In the future, we should strengthen the leadership of the movement from beginning to end. At the same time, the movement to increase production and practice economy is comprehensive. Every aspect of the entire enterprise activity, whether it is technical work, planning management and production organization work, financial work, labor and wage work, administrative management work, etc., should be included in the movement to increase production and practice economy. An enterprise is a complex organic organization. If all the personnel in these organizations are not fully mobilized, the savings in this aspect may be wasted in another aspect. A comprehensive movement to increase production and practice economy that penetrates into every corner of the enterprise can plug all loopholes and achieve the most effective economic results.
    At present, many machinery enterprises are carrying out technical transformation, strengthening economic accounting, and now launching a movement to increase production and practice economy. How can these tasks be combined? In fact, these tasks are intrinsically linked. Technical transformation is a means to transform repair-type enterprises into regular manufacturing enterprises. Only through technical transformation can we reform the technical work and organizational management work of the enterprise, establish a good production order, master advanced process methods, carry out regular production, and make the entire enterprise activity achieve a high degree of economic effect, which is the most effective increase in production and practice of economy. The economic effect of increasing production and practicing economy must be promoted and consolidated by the economic accounting system. Otherwise, after a gust of wind, the results of increasing production and practicing economy will vanish. Therefore, the movement to increase production and practice economy is the driving force for promoting all enterprise work, while technical transformation and economic accounting are the means and methods to achieve the goal of increasing production and practicing economy. As long as these tasks are considered comprehensively and arranged uniformly according to the specific situation of the enterprise, and the central link is grasped in each stage to promote the work, there will be no insurmountable contradictions.

    节约金属，增产国家最需要的机械产品
    本报评论员
    今年，我国机械工业面临一个新的局面：一方面，由于金属材料供应不足，生产的增长受到了限制，很多企业任务不饱满，能力不能充分发挥；另一方面，若干产品的品种和数量，又满足不了国民经济各部门的需要。这是当前机械工业发展中的一个困难问题。只有在机械企业内开展一个全面的增产节约运动，特别是发动职工群众节约金属，增产国民经济当前最需要的机械产品，才能顺利克服今年的困难，并把机械工业向前推进一步。
    过去机械工业企业的增产节约，大多着重于克服那些明显的浪费，如收集和利用废料，节省某些管理费用等等，这些都是重要的。今年，除了继续克服明显的浪费以外，要求企业大力提高技术和组织管理水平，在资金、材料和工时等方面，采取有效措施，实行严格的节约，以求取得全面的经济效果。由于材料的限制，机械企业今年增产节约的重点在于节约，而其中心环节，是从改进产品设计和工艺方法来节约金属材料。金属材料的大力节约，可以使国民经济多得到很多机械产品，这对增加国家的积累，促进社会主义工业建设的速度，都有极大作用。因此，应该把节约金属材料的工作，看成社会主义工业建设的一项根本政策。可惜，前几年机械工业的广大职工，并没有对节约金属材料的问题，给予充分重视。这主要表现在大家没去着重从技术上采取措施，来解决材料问题。今后，这个问题必须积极解决。
    从改进技术来节约金属材料，这在机械企业中是有很大的潜力可以挖掘的。例如，无锡柴油机厂的三十马力柴油机，由于改进设计结构，每台产品可以减轻四分之一的重量，全年可节约四百二十吨钢材。沈阳风动工具厂在1956年上半年，由于改进产品的制造工艺和设计，节约钢材共一百四十六吨，可以多生产OM—506凿岩机三百六十台。据估计，重型机械、矿山机械和很多工作母机，减轻10％的重量，是完全可能的。大型而复杂的产品如船舶、机车、汽车等，节约金属材料的潜力更大，可以努力的方面更多。据第一机械工业部机车车辆工业管理局最近初步核算，这个局所属企业的全部产品在采取改变设计、修改技术条件和改进工艺等措施之后，预计全年内能节约钢材六千余吨。目前，第一机械工业部所属企业金属材料的平均利用率，仅达62％，这就是说，一百吨钢材中，有三十八吨是被切削掉了！如果提高材料的利用率，再加上减轻单位产品重量所节约的材料，那是可以增产很多机械产品的。
    为了更好地从改进产品设计和工艺方法来节约金属，减轻机器重量，首先要教育广大技术人员和生产工人，克服在这项工作中的保守思想和教条主义倾向。我们国内测绘的机器，往往比实样重10％—15％，为什么呢？就是设计人员为了安全，加大了系数。又如，球墨铸铁，我国在性能的研究上并不落后，但推广则很迟缓，为什么呢？原因之一就是没有注意解决在应用上的技术问题，有些技术人员总感到球墨铸铁不如钢料保险。有些企业的技术人员，往往借口国外技术资料的规定，不愿更改设计，组织材料的代用。有些生产工人也习惯于老一套的工艺方法，往往对新工艺有抵触情绪。这些思想障碍，急需加强教育予以消除。当然，任何设计和工艺的改进，都必须经过分析和比较，试验与核算，找出科学的根据，以保证产品的质量、性能和使用时的经济合理。产品的质量和使用时的经济合理，是对国民经济有长远影响的因素，需要十分重视。
    今年机械工业总的情况是材料供应不足，所以增产什么的问题必须慎重考虑。目前，体现在计划中的，有些机器产品可能有多余，同时若干产品又满足不了需要，有的产品甚至是缺门，这就需要工业管理部门统筹安排，作许多深入的工作，加强材料的平衡调剂和生产的计划性。新产品的试制要加强，以便尽可能供应国民经济各部门广泛的需要。一切有需要的产品，要想尽一切办法增产。缺门要填补起来。预计有积压的产品要适当控制生产。总之，要把辛苦节约得到的材料，用于生产当前国民经济最需要的产品上去。机械企业应该在专业的基础上，充分发展多品种生产的能力，以适应市场多方面的需要。
    广泛发动机械工业的职工群众，提高他们的思想认识，是使增产节约运动深入开展的一个极为重要的条件。可是，有的同志看到1956年生产高潮和群众运动中的某些偏向，便感到机械企业未必适宜于开展群众运动。这种看法是不全面的。他们只看到去年企业群众运动中某些次要的消极的方面，而忽视群众发动之后，提高了觉悟，纷纷突破定额，将生产能力大大提高一步这个积极的主要的方面。否认运动，也就是否认企业有发动群众的必要性，否认千百万群众的活动有服从一个统一的政治目标的必要性，这当然是不对的。群众的活动，在任何时候都应该有一个明确的政治目标，如果忘记了发动群众来为一个特定的政治目标奋斗，我们就没有社会主义的建设了。问题在于：要适应企业本身的特点来发动群众，而不能采取不正常的方法，把群众运动强加于企业。如果在机械工业企业中结合着技术改造和经济核算，将职工群众的创造性劳动都纳入一定的轨道，有秩序地开展劳动竞赛，那就既能增产节约，又能促进企业技术、组织水平的提高，这样，运动就合乎企业发展的要求了。反之，如果采取不正当的方法，如加班突击、忽视质量、不顾均衡生产、吃光在制品、偷工减料等等，就违反了企业本身的规律，结果，表面上似乎是增产，实际上是减产；表面上是节约，实际上是浪费。问题还在于：在整个运动过程中要有坚强正确的领导。过去搞运动，一般都注意抓两头，即动员号召与评比，而忽视了运动过程中的检查和督促，忽视了及时纠正偏向，贯彻方针政策。今后，应该自始至终的加强运动的领导。同时，增产节约运动是全面的，整个企业活动的每个方面，无论技术工作、计划管理和生产组织工作、财务工作、劳动工资工作、行政管理工作等等，都应该包罗在增产节约运动之中。企业是一个复杂的有机组织，如果这些组织中的所有人员不全面地发动起来，可能这方面的节约，就被另一方面浪费掉了。而全面的、深入到企业各个角落的增产节约运动，就能堵塞一切漏洞，取得最有成效的经济效果。
    当前，很多机械企业正在进行技术改造，又要加强经济核算工作，现在又要开展增产节约运动，这些工作怎样捏在一块呢？其实，这些工作是有内在联系的。技术改造是使修配性质的企业转变为正规制造性质的企业的一个手段。只有通过技术改造，才能革新企业的技术工作与组织管理工作，建立起良好的生产秩序，掌握先进的工艺方法，进行规规矩矩的生产，使整个企业活动达到高度的经济效果，也即是最有效的增产节约。而增产节约的经济效果，又必需用经济核算制度来促进和巩固。否则，一阵风刮过去，增产节约的成果，又将化为乌有了。所以，增产节约运动是推动全部企业工作的动力，而技术改造与经济核算等工作，则是达到增产节约这个目的的手段和方法。只要根据企业的具体情况，将这些工作通盘考虑，统一安排，而各段时期又抓着中心环节推动工作，就不会感到有不可克服的矛盾了。
