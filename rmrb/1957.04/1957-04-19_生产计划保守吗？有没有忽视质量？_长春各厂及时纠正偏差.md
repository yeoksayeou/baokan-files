Are Production Plans Conservative? Is Quality Being Neglected?
    Changchun Factories Promptly Correct Deviations

    (Our dispatch) One important result of the increased production and thrift movement in Changchun City factories in the first quarter of this year is that they completed their production plans ahead of schedule or exceeded them, despite difficulties in the supply of raw materials. The Changchun Instrument Factory, which failed to meet its plan for eight months last year, has now fully completed its production tasks every month this year. The First Automobile Factory, which had the most difficulty in steel supply, completed its first quarter car production task ahead of schedule. Now, the factories are conducting in-depth inspections. Some factories are revising their original plans and correcting various one-sided viewpoints based on new situations that have emerged during the movement.

    Some factories have found that they have not paid attention to increasing production in the process of saving raw materials. The Electric Wood Factory and the Changchun Automobile Accompanying Tool Manufacturing Factory, which have the conditions to increase production, have revised their original plans and decided to increase production by more than one million yuan compared to the original plan.

    In the previous stage, factories generally paid more attention to saving raw materials, but neglected product quality. Confectionery, beer, and other products were of poor quality, and commercial departments had to return them. The Jilin Refractory Materials Factory blindly accelerated production speed because ordering units urged delivery, resulting in a kiln collapse accident during brick firing, with a loss of more than 4,000 yuan. Some factories' careless revisions of designs have also affected product quality. Recently, some factories have proposed annual quality improvement plans while revising and reviewing their original plans. However, some factories still neglect quality and do not regard improving quality as an inseparable part of the increased production and thrift movement.

### 生产计划保守吗？有没有忽视质量？  长春各厂及时纠正偏差

    生产计划保守吗？有没有忽视质量？
    长春各厂及时纠正偏差
    本报讯　今年第一季度长春市各工厂增产节约运动的一个重要成果，就是在原材料供应困难的条件下，提前或者超额完成了生产计划。去年一年有八个月没完成计划的长春仪器厂今年月月全面完成生产任务。钢材供应最困难的第一汽车厂早就提前完成第一季度生产汽车的任务。现在各工厂正深入检查。有些工厂根据运动中出现的新情况，重新修改原计划，纠正各种片面观点。
    有些厂发现在节约原材料的过程中，没有注意增产。有条件增产的电木和长春汽车随车工具制造厂，已重新修改原计划，决定比原计划再增产价值一百多万元的产品。
    前一阶段一般工厂都比较注意节约原材料，但忽视了产品质量。糖果、啤酒等，质量不好，商业部门不得不退货。吉林省耐火材料厂因为订货单位催货，就盲目加快生产速度，造成烧砖倒窑事故，损失四千多元。有些工厂修改设计不慎重，也影响产品质量。最近有些厂在修改、审查原计划的同时，已经提出全年提高质量的方案。但是，有些工厂还忽视质量，没有把提高质量当成增产节约的一个不可分割的部分。
