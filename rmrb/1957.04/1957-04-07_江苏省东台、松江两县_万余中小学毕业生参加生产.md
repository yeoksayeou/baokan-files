In Dongtai and Songjiang Counties, Jiangsu Province, more than 10,000 primary and secondary school graduates participate in production

(By Our Newspaper) In Dongtai County and Songjiang County, Jiangsu Province, junior high and senior primary school graduates who participated in agricultural production have made contributions to the country's agricultural construction.

There are more than 6,300 junior high and senior primary school graduates in Dongtai County who are participating in agricultural production. For example, the fifteen senior primary school graduates in the Lujiaqiao production team of the Xinzhou Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Chengdong District participated in agricultural production after graduating in 1954 and devoted themselves to studying agricultural technology. In the past, when farmers in this team planted cotton, they carried the cotton seeds on their backs in cloth bags and scattered the seeds into the rows by hand, which was laborious, inconvenient, and inefficient. Each person could only plant four mu per day at most. Lu Chunsong, a senior primary school graduate, and others studied the problem and made a seeder out of lead. Cotton planted with the seeder was uniform, labor-saving, and improved labor efficiency. Each person could plant seven mu per day. Dai Jingan, a senior primary school graduate in the urban area, participated in bamboo weaving production and learned to make more than ten kinds of bamboo products, such as bamboo baskets, rain canopies, etc., in half a year. During the construction of water conservancy projects, more than 400 senior primary school graduates in the county took the lead in carrying river mud. Up to now, among all the junior high and senior primary school graduates participating in agricultural production, more than 1,300 have served as chairmen and vice-chairmen of agricultural cooperatives, as well as accountants and production team leaders, and 39 have joined the Chinese Communist Party.

The more than 5,000 junior high and senior primary school graduates in Songjiang County who are participating in agricultural production have mastered various agricultural production techniques. In the Lianmin Agricultural Cooperative, where Chen Yongkang, a national model of high rice yield, is located, fifteen junior high and primary school graduates have learned more than ten relatively complex agricultural techniques, such as seed soaking, close planting, and water management, with the help of experienced farmers in the cooperative. Among them, five people have also become the cooperative's water pump operators, breeders, and accountants. After participating in the county's veterinary training class, Sun Yaokun, a senior primary school graduate, cured 97 sick pigs for the cooperative in one year. His work was very successful and he received a commendation from the Songjiang County Committee of the Communist Youth League.

    江苏省东台、松江两县
    万余中小学毕业生参加生产
    本报讯　江苏省东台县和松江县参加农业生产的初中、高小毕业生，为祖国的农业建设作出了贡献。
    东台县参加农业生产的初中、高小毕业生共有六千三百多人。如城东区新周农业生产合作社陆家桥生产队中的十五个高小毕业生，他们在1954年毕业后就参加农业生产，并且用心钻研农业技术。这个队的农民过去种棉花，用布袋把棉种背在身上，用手抓种子向行子里撒，这样做既吃力又不方便，劳动效率又低。每人一天顶多只能播种四亩。高小毕业生陆春松与大家一起研究后，用铅皮制成播种器。用播种器播种的棉花，既均匀又省力，也提高了劳动效率。每人一天可以播种七亩。城区高小毕业生戴静安参加竹篾业生产，半年中即学会了制竹箩、篮子、雨篷等十多种竹器。在兴修水利工程中，全县有四百多个高小毕业生带头挑河泥。到目前为止，在全部参加农业生产的初中、高小毕业生中，已有一千三百多人担任了农业社的正副社长以及会计、生产队长等职务，共有三十九人参加了中国共产党。
    松江县参加农业生产的五千多名初中、高小毕业生，已经掌握了各项农业生产技术。在全国水稻丰产模范陈永康所在的联民农业社里，有十五名初中、小学毕业生在社里老农的帮助下，已经学会浸种、密植、水浆管理等十多项比较复杂的农业技术，其中有五个人还当了社里的抽水机手、饲养员和会计。高小毕业生孙耀坤参加县兽医训练班学习后，一年中为社里医好九十七头病猪。他的工作成绩很好，受到了青年团松江县委的通报表扬。
