Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 26th. Since the establishment of the Hungarian Communist Youth League in mid-March, the country has already had 40,000 Youth League members, and the number of League branches has exceeded 1,000.

The above was stated by Komocsin Zoltán, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Hungarian Communist Youth League, at a meeting of Youth League activists held in Budapest on the 24th. More than 1,000 young workers, university students, and middle school students participated in the meeting. The meeting mainly discussed issues related to the tasks of the Youth League.

In his report, Komocsin also pointed out that, based on the current situation, the Socialist Workers' Party has a foundation among young people. More and more young people who were deceived in the October events of last year are becoming sober. He said that it must be recognized that the majority of workers, especially young workers, are not counter-revolutionaries.

When talking about the organizational work of the League, he criticized the erroneous view that only young people who apply to join the Party should be accepted into the League. He also pointed out that there is an incorrect, but extremely common, argument regarding the tasks of the Youth League, namely that youth organizations are only responsible for organizing recreational activities for young people. He said that it is necessary to pay more attention to the recreational life of young people, but at the same time, attention must be paid to the political and ideological education of young people.

    匈牙利共青团员达四万名
    团支部发展到一千多个
    新华社布达佩斯26日电　自从3月中旬匈牙利共产主义青年团成立以来，全国已经有共青团员四万名，团的支部已经发展到一千多个。
    以上是匈牙利共青团筹备委员会主席科莫钦·佐尔坦24日在布达佩斯举行的一个共青团积极分子大会上谈到的。参加这个大会的有一千多名青年工人、大学生和中学生。会上主要讨论了有关共青团的任务问题。
    科莫钦在他的报告中还指出，就目前的情况来看，社会主义工人党在青年中是有基础的。在去年十月事件中受欺骗的青年越来越多地清醒过来了。他说，必须认识到大部分工人，特别是青年工人并不是反革命分子。
    在谈到团的组织工作时，他批判了那种认为只能接受要求入党的青年入团的错误观点。他还指出目前在有关共青团任务方面存在的不正确、但是极普遍的一种论调，就是青年组织只负有组织青年进行文娱活动的职责。他说，多关心青年的文娱生活是必要的，但是必须同时注意对青年的政治思想教育。
