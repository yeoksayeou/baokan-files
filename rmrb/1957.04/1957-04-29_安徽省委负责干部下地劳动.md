Responsible cadres of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee Go to the Countryside to Participate in Labor

(By our own correspondent) Since the end of last year, the broad masses of cadres in agencies, organizations, schools, and factories in various parts of Anhui Province have been cultivating various crops and engaging in various sideline productions in their spare time while carrying out various activities to increase production and practice thrift.

Many responsible comrades of various units took the lead in participating in labor. Li Shinong, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Provincial Party Committee, who is working in Dingyuan County, Liu Shangtong, Secretary of the Dingyuan County Party Committee, and Lu Xiang, along with more than 300 cadres from various agencies, walked to Qijiawan, which is eighteen miles away from the city, to engage in production. Although Comrade Li Shinong is already very old, he still carried water, spread fertilizer, and planted seeds like everyone else, working tirelessly. On the afternoon of April 6, Tao Junan, Deputy Minister of the Organization Department of the Provincial Party Committee, and nine section chiefs and directors, along with other comrades in the department, dug the ground and picked up stones in the wasteland. They were determined to reclaim the three acres of wasteland into a beautiful vegetable garden. In the twenty days from March 7 to 27, cadres of directly subordinate agencies in Zhide County had reclaimed thirty-seven mu of wasteland, accumulated four hundred and thirty dan of fertilizer, raised one hundred and eighty-three pigs, and raised thirty-four rabbits.

    安徽省委负责干部下地劳动
    本报讯　安徽省各地机关、团体、学校、工厂的广大干部，自去年年底以来，在开展多种多样增产节约活动的同时，利用业余时间种植各种农作物，并开展各种副业生产。
    很多单位的负责同志带头参加劳动。正在定远县帮助工作的省委书记处书记李世农、定远县委书记刘尚同、陆祥，跟三百多名机关干部在一起，步行到离城十八里路的戚家洼进行生产。李世农同志虽然年龄已经很大，但是他仍和大家一样担水、撒粪、点种，忙个不歇。4月6日下午，省委组织部副部长陶均安和九名处长、主任一级的干部跟部内其他同志一齐在荒地里挖地，捡石子，他们决心要把三亩荒地开垦成美丽的菜园。至德县直属机关干部在3月7日至27日的二十天中，已开荒三十七亩，积肥四百三十担，养猪一百八十三头，养兔三十四只。
