    Go Deep, Overcome Blindness
    By our reporter Gu Weijin
    I was reading a newspaper in the office of Director Zhang of the Rural Work Department of the Huangpi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party when I suddenly heard someone nearby mention that "Han Guozhi stayed here for many days." The name sounded familiar. Who was he? Then I remembered, he was the Deputy Secretary of the Xiaogan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. I had heard that he often went down to the villages and that his working methods were different from some people's – he didn't just sit in the county committee office listening to reports, but really went deep and helped the county committee solve problems. So, was he here in Huangpi this time to help the county committee solve some problem again? I asked Director Zhang of the Rural Work Department. He said, "He solved a very important problem."
    "What problem?" "The problem of blindness and one-sidedness." Then, he told me the whole story:
    It must have been February 28th when Han Guozhi arrived in Huancheng Township. He was there to collect materials on educating farmers, but the winter crops there caught his attention: some were frozen to death, some were missing seedlings, and some varied greatly in size. He hurriedly asked the township cadres how much harvest they expected from this year's winter crops. The township cadres shook their heads and said, "The original plan for wheat was a yield of 200 jin per mu, but now we estimate a maximum of 140 to 150 jin; the original plan for rapeseed was a yield of 150 jin per mu, but now we estimate a maximum of 70 to 80 jin; barley, beans, and other crops will also be difficult to fulfill the plan." Han Guozhi was a little surprised: this township was a key focus of the county committee's work, so how could the winter crops be so poor? He went back to the county committee to inquire and learned that the winter crops in other places were about the same as in Huancheng Township.
      "Winter crops are growing poorly because planting was delayed by a season and the base fertilizer was insufficient, all due to a lack of labor," some county committee members explained to him.
    Han Guozhi paused for a moment and said, "A Huangpi County with a population of over 800,000 still lacks labor? That's really strange!"
    "Last year, all parts of the county expanded the area under multiple cropping, and labor became scarce."
    "How much did you expand the area under multiple cropping last year?"
    "By 36%."
    Han Guozhi said, "Since you felt a lack of labor last year when you expanded the area under multiple cropping, why are you planning to expand the area by another 10% this year on top of last year? Wouldn't labor be even more scarce?"
    "Last year, the main experience of the county's bumper grain harvest (an average yield of 808 jin per mu) was to expand the area under multiple cropping. This year, if we want to strive for an even bigger bumper harvest (a planned average yield of 950 jin per mu), we can only continue to expand the area under multiple cropping. Of course, labor will be even more strained this year, but if we don't do this, where can we find a way to increase grain production?"
    "Hmm, so that's how it is." Han Guozhi hummed in a low voice and said nothing more. Everyone thought that the question he wanted to understand had been answered satisfactorily. Who knew that when he returned to his room, he began to frown over this issue. "Expanding the area under multiple cropping is indeed a way to increase grain production. But, judging from Huancheng Township and other places, after expanding the area under multiple cropping, there is not enough labor, which affects the ability to increase the production of wheat, barley, rapeseed, beans, and other economic crops. How can this problem be solved?" He intended to suggest that the county committee reduce the area under multiple cropping, so that labor could be freed up to do a good job with various economic crops. However, if the area under multiple cropping is reduced, what about the reduction in grain production?
    The next day, Han Guozhi invited the county committee secretary and deputy secretary to visit a representative cooperative in a mountainous area – the Guangming No. 1 Cooperative in Changling Township. They looked at the cooperative's winter crops there, and they were not growing well, just like in Huancheng Township. They interviewed cooperative cadres, activists, members, old farmers, etc., and they reported the following situations: after the cooperative expanded the area under multiple cropping last year, they were too busy, and they were short of more than 1,000 workdays, so cultivation was very rough: rice was not densely planted enough, wheat was still broadcast, rapeseed fields were not properly prepared, and the amount of fertilizer applied to the more than 1,000 mu of autumn and winter crops only reached 30%-50% of the original plan. Cultivation techniques were not implemented according to the original requirements. The winter crops were planted one season late, and with insufficient base fertilizer, the future harvest was very questionable – at most, it could reach 50%-60% of the plan. Because the winter planting was delayed, it affected winter water conservancy construction and the development of sideline production... Han Guozhi and the county committee secretary and others saw more specifically that a series of serious problems were caused by the expansion of the area under multiple cropping and the resulting lack of labor. How to solve it? Han Guozhi thought for a long time, and he very patiently analyzed and compared each problem. Gradually, his mind cleared up: after expanding the area under multiple cropping, there is not enough labor, cultivation is rough... hmm, with rough cultivation, the potential for increasing production must be very great! If we appropriately reduce the area under multiple cropping and allow labor to change from being insufficient to being surplus, and implement intensive cultivation and timely sowing, couldn't the unit area yield of grain and various economic crops be increased? Isn't this the way to comprehensively increase production? He excitedly conducted research with the county committee secretary and others, and they all said that this method was good. However, when the cooperative cadres heard that they were going to reduce the area under multiple cropping, they became anxious. They thought: Last year, how many "thousand-jin townships" and "thousand-jin cooperatives" appeared in the county! And their cooperative's grain yield per unit area was only 700 jin, which was too disgraceful! This year, they planned to use the method of expanding the area under multiple cropping to definitely create a "thousand-jin cooperative." Now that they want to reduce the area under multiple cropping, isn't this "thousand-jin cooperative" hopeless? Han Guozhi and others figured out what they were thinking. At a forum with cooperative directors and team leaders, they calculated an account with them: according to the current area under multiple cropping, it would take 4,695 workdays to complete the multiple cropping tasks (including winter planting), and the cooperative could only mobilize 3,461 workdays from all the labor force, a shortage of 1,234 workdays. If the area under multiple cropping was reduced by 30%, only 2,569 workdays would be needed to complete the multiple cropping tasks, leaving a surplus of 892 workdays. They also calculated how much of these surplus workdays would be used for close planting of rice seedlings and close-row planting of wheat, how much would be used for accumulating natural fertilizer and strengthening cultivation techniques, and how much would be used for winter water conservancy construction and developing sideline production... As a result, the yield of rice per unit area would be 30% higher than the original plan, the yield of wheat per unit area would be 60% higher than the original plan, and the yield of rapeseed per unit area would be 140% higher than the original plan. The total grain output for the year would be slightly higher than the original plan, reaching 1,000 jin per mu; the total sideline income for the year would increase from the planned 6,500 yuan to 8,372 yuan, and the average household income from sideline production would increase from the planned 50-60 yuan to 80-90 yuan...
    Each cooperative cadre was smiling, and it was clear that they were satisfied with this approach. A noisy sound rang out in the room:
    "This calculation makes it clear! Relying on blindly expanding the area under multiple cropping to increase production is not as cost-effective as relying on intensive cultivation to increase production – grain still reaches 1,000 jin per mu, the unit area yield of other crops has increased, and sideline income has also increased, which is truly a comprehensive increase in production."
    At the forum with old farmers and among the broad masses of cooperative members, this matter was discussed with great interest. They said: "Labor is not passive, the season is not passive, and overall production can be increased. This time, experts have emerged from among the cadres!"
    The management committee decided to reduce the area under multiple cropping by 30%.
    Returning to the county committee from Guangming No. 1 Cooperative, Han Guozhi convened directors of four representative cooperatives in the plain area and two district committee secretaries to discuss the situation of expanding the area under multiple cropping. Han Guozhi also went to Xinchun Cooperative with Director Zhang of the county committee to further understand the situation of expanding the area under multiple cropping. The information obtained from various sources showed that although the natural conditions of these cooperatives were different from those of Guangming No. 1 Cooperative, the cadres' one-sided pursuit of increasing grain production and their neglect of comprehensive production, resulting in excessive expansion of the area under multiple cropping, leading to labor shortages and affecting intensive cultivation and improvement of unit area yields, were the same. They should and could all implement comprehensive production increase like Guangming No. 1 Cooperative.
    At the county committee meeting, Han Guozhi presented a large number of facts to illustrate the necessity and methods of implementing comprehensive production increases. Everyone was very moved. Some people said: "The matter of expanding the area under multiple cropping must be carefully considered! Last year, expanding the area under multiple cropping increased grain production, and this year we expanded the area under multiple cropping again. If grain production increases this year, we will of course expand the area under multiple cropping next year... If we continue to do this, it will lead to passive labor year after year, and we will not be able to achieve comprehensive production increases, which is a big problem." Some people said: "Originally, expanding the area under multiple cropping to increase grain production is a good thing, but we are not acting according to our capabilities, but blindly expanding, which turns a good thing into a bad thing. This is all due to the idea of one-sidedly increasing grain production. We must accept this lesson and reduce blindness and one-sidedness!"
    Han Guozhi and them studied reducing the planned area under multiple cropping for the entire county by 10%. According to this calculation, not only would the phenomenon of labor shortages be eliminated, but also a lot of labor would be surplus, which could be used for intensive cultivation, timely sowing, water conservancy construction, and the development of sideline production. Preliminary calculations show that this year's total grain output will be 4% higher than the original plan and 7% higher than last year; the total sideline income will be 18.8% higher than the original plan and 47.5% higher than last year; and the total output value of agriculture and sideline industries will be 7.6% higher than the original plan and 29% higher than last year. At the same time, this year's winter crops can be planted in time, with sufficient base fertilizer, and next year's output will be greatly increased.

    深入下去，克服了盲目性
    本报记者　古维进
    正在中共黄陂县委会农村工作部张部长的房子里看报，我忽然听见旁边有人谈起“韩国治在这里住了好多天”。这名字有点熟，他是谁？我想起来了，他是中共孝感地委副书记。听人说，他经常下乡，他的工作方法和有些人不一样——不是光坐在县委机关听汇报，而是真正深入下去，切实帮助县委解决问题。那末，这一次他来黄陂是不是又帮助县委解决了什么问题呢？我询问农村工作部张部长。他说：“解决了一个很重要的问题。”
    “什么问题？”“盲目性、片面性的问题。”接着，他给我谈了事情的始末：
    是2月28日吧，韩国治到了环城乡。他是到那里收集关于教育农民的材料的，可是，那里的冬播作物引起了他的注意：有的冻死，有的缺苗，有的大小悬殊。他忙问乡干部今年的冬播作物会有多少收成？乡干部摇头说：“小麦原计划单位面积产量二百斤，现在估计最多收一百四五十斤；油菜原计划单位面积产量一百五十斤，现在估计最多收七八十斤；大麦、豆类等也很难完成计划。”韩国治有点诧异：这个乡是县委的工作重点，怎么冬播作物这样不好呢？他回到县委会打听一下，了解到其他地方的冬播作物也和环城乡差不多。
      “冬播作物长得不好，是因为下种推迟一个季节和底肥不足，这都是劳动力缺乏的缘故。”有些县委委员给他这样解释。
    韩国治楞了一阵，说：“一个八十多万人口的黄陂县，还缺乏劳动力？真是奇事呀！”
    “去年全县各地扩大了复种面积，劳动力就感到缺乏了。”
    “去年扩大了多少复种面积？”
    “扩大了36％。”
    韩国治说：“既然去年扩大复种面积感到了劳动力不够，为什么今年还计划在去年的基础上再扩大复种面积10％呢？这样，劳动力不是更加不够用了吗？”
    “去年全县粮食丰产（平均亩产八百零八斤）的主要经验是扩大复种面积，今年要想争取更大的丰产（计划平均亩产九百五十斤），只有继续扩大复种面积。当然，今年的劳动力更加紧张了，但是，如果不这样做，哪里去找粮食增产的门路呢？”
    “嗯，原来是这样。”韩国治低沉地哼了一句，再没有说什么了。大家以为他要了解的问题已经得到圆满答复。谁知道他回到房子里，为着这个问题皱起眉头来了。“扩大复种面积，确实是增产粮食的门路。但是，从环城乡等地来看，扩大复种面积后，劳动力不够用，影响了小麦、大麦、油菜、豆类等多种经济作物不能增产，这个问题怎么解决呢？”他打算建议县委缩小复种面积，这样可以抽出劳动力去搞好多种经济作物。可是，缩小了复种面积，粮食减产怎么办呢？
    第二天韩国治邀县委书记、副书记一块到了山区有代表性的一个合作社——长岭乡光明一社。他们在这里看了看社里的冬播作物，和环城乡的一样长得不好。访问了社干部、积极分子、社员、老农等，他们反映了这样一些情况：去年社里扩大复种面积后，忙不过来，缺少了一千多个工，耕作很粗糙：水稻不够密植，小麦还是撒播，油菜田没有整好，一千多亩秋季复播作物和冬播作物的施肥量，只能达到原计划的30％—50％，耕作技术措施没有按原来的要求去办；冬播作物迟了一个季节才下种，加以底肥不足，将来的收成很成问题——最多能达到计划的50％—60％；由于冬播推迟了季节，影响了冬季兴修水利和开展副业生产。……韩国治和县委书记等更具体地看见了由于扩大复种面积，劳动力不够用，带来一系列的严重问题。怎样解决呢？韩国治想了半天，他非常耐心地把每一个问题加以分析、比较，渐渐地心里亮堂起来了：扩大复种面积后，劳动力不够用，耕作粗糙，……唔，耕作粗糙，增产的潜力一定很大！如果适当缩小复种面积、让劳动力由不足变为有余，实行精耕细作，适时播种，粮食和多种经济作物的单位面积产量不是都可以提高吗？这不是全面增产的门路吗？他兴冲冲地和县委书记等进行了研究，都说这个办法要得。可是，社干部听说要缩小复种面积就着急了，他们想：去年全县出现多少粮食“千斤乡”“千斤社”啊！而自己的社粮食单位面积产量只有七百斤，太不光彩了！今年准备以扩大复种面积的方法，一定要搞个“千斤社”。现在要缩小复种面积，这“千斤社”不是无望了吗？韩国治等摸透了他们的心思，在社主任、队长座谈会上，同他们算了一笔账：根据现在的复种面积，要想完成复种任务（包括冬播），需要四千六百九十五个工，社里调动所有的劳动力，只有三千四百六十一个工，尚差一千二百三十四个工；如果把复种面积缩小30％，只要二千五百六十九个工就可以完成复种任务，尚余八百九十二个工。他们又计算了这些剩余的工有多少用于水稻小株密植和小麦密植条播，多少用于积蓄自然肥料和加强耕作技术措施，多少用于冬季兴修水利和开展副业生产。……这一来，水稻单位面积产量要比原计划提高30％，小麦单位面积产量要比原计划提高60％，油菜单位面积产量要比原计划提高140％。全年粮食总产量要比原计划稍有提高，达到亩产千斤；全年副业总收入要由原计划的六千五百元增加到八千三百七十二元，家庭副业平均每户收入要由原计划五六十元增加到八九十元……。
    每个社干部都笑眯眯的，显然，他们对于这样做是满意的。屋子里响起了噪杂的声音：
    “这一算心里明白了！依靠盲目扩大复种面积增产，就不如依靠精耕细作增产合算——粮食还是达到亩产千斤，其他作物的单位面积产量都提高了，副业收入也增加了，这真是全面增产。”
    在老农座谈会上和广大社员中，都以很大的兴趣讨论这件事情。他们说：“劳力不被动，季节不被动，又能全面增产。这一回，干部里面出了专家！”
    管理委员会决定缩小复种面积30％。
    从光明一社回到县委会，韩国治召集了平原地区有代表性的四个社的主任和两个区委书记座谈了扩大复种面积的情况，韩国治又亲自和县委张部长到新春社进一步了解了扩大复种面积的情形。从各方面得来的情况说明，这些合作社的自然条件等虽然同光明一社有所不同，但是，社干部片面追求增产粮食，忽视全面增产，因而过多的扩大复种面积，造成劳动力紧张，影响精耕细作和提高单位面积产量，这些情况是相同的。他们都应该而且可能像光明一社那样实行全面增产。
    在县委会议上，韩国治拿出大量的事实说明实行全面增产的必要和作法。每个人都很感动。有的人说：“扩大复种面积这事情得好好考虑了！去年扩大复种面积，粮食增产了，今年又扩大复种面积；今年要是粮食增了产，明年当然还要扩大复种面积……这样搞下去，就要造成年年劳力被动，年年不能全面增产，这可是一个大问题了。”有的人说：“本来嘛，扩大复种面积，增产粮食，是好事情，可是，我们不是量力而为，而是盲目扩大，这就把好事办成坏事了。这都是片面增产粮食的思想作怪。必须接受这一次的教训，减少盲目性和片面性！”
    韩国治同他们研究把全县的复种面积计划缩小10％。这样算下来，不仅消除了劳动力不足的现象，还多余了许多劳动力，可用于精耕细作，适时播种，兴修水利和开展副业生产等。初步计算，今年的粮食总产量要比原计划提高4％，比去年提高7％；副业总收入要比原计划提高18.8％，比去年提高47.5％；农副业总产值要比原计划提高7.6％，比去年提高29％。同时，今年的冬播作物可以赶上季节下种，施足底肥，明年的产量就会大大提高。
