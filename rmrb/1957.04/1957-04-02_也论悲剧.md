    Also on Tragedy
    Peng Ding
    In Mr. Lao She's "On Tragedy" (see People's Daily, March 18), he raised the question of "Is it true that there is no tragic reality in our society today, and therefore no tragic works can be produced?" I would like to offer some opinions on this.
    I believe that in today's socialist society, of course, there are still tragic realities. Mr. Lao She's examples of "a cadre with a good heart doing bad things, leading to popular anger and trouble" is a tragedy, or "a cadre not caring for his children, leading to their committing crimes" is a tragedy; and the matter of Comrade Stalin is also a great tragedy.
    I do not know the classical definition of tragedy. But from the tragic works I have read, it seems that the following situations constitute a tragedy: the character's subjective motives are always just, but his subjective understanding is mistaken, thus creating a contradiction between the subjective and the objective, and as a result, his just subjective motives are negated by objective reality, and there is no turning back. In this way, on the one hand, we feel the character's sublimity or greatness, and on the other hand, we feel the harshness of objective reality, thus arousing feelings of sympathy and fear—the painful tragic feelings of sympathy for the character and fear of reality.
    Here, the justice of the character is paramount. The destruction of villains will never give rise to a sense of tragedy. When Xiang Yu committed suicide by the Wu River, he said, "Heaven is destroying me, not the fault of my fighting." In the end, he refused to admit even his subjective strategic errors, but we still sympathize with him and regard his ending as a tragedy. When Caesar was stabbed by Brutus, he said, "Et tu, Brute? Then fall, Caesar!" Realizing that he had misunderstood his friend in the past. We think this is also a tragedy. This is because we acknowledge that both men were always just. But who says that Hitler's suicide and Mussolini's hanging were tragedies? Similarly, Lin Daiyu's death is a tragedy, but Wang Xifeng's death is not a tragedy. The common people never consider the wicked getting their due as a tragedy.
    Conscious sacrifice for a great purpose is not a tragedy, such as the endings of Liu Hulan and Dong Cunrui. Only when one subjectively makes a mistake and is negated by the objective, and when it reaches the point of no return, does it become a tragedy. Fadeyev's famous work "The Rout" reflecting the destruction of a guerrilla detachment is not a tragedy, but Shi Dakai's annihilation on the banks of the Dadu River is a tragedy. And the contradiction between the subjective and the objective will exist not only in today's socialist society, but also in the future communist society. Then, tragedies will always occur, although the quantity will decrease and the nature will be different, but the profoundness will be enhanced. Because, for those who are completely blind to the objective and basically do not know how to understand the objective, and therefore have no way to control their own destiny, that tragedy is not as profound as the tragedy of people who basically know how to control their destiny but still inevitably fall into destruction.
    Many people say that Stalin's affair was a tragedy. But in my opinion, only "On the Historical Experience of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat" is correct; it says, "On the whole, Stalin always stood in front of the historical tide to guide the struggle, and he was an irreconcilable enemy of imperialism. Even when he made mistakes, his tragedy lay in the fact that he believed it was necessary to defend the interests of the workers from enemy invasion." However, Stalin died, and he had no chance to correct his mistakes himself, which is a profound tragedy. But if, as some people say, it was the result of his "stupidity," then Stalin's affair would not be a tragedy.
    Ancient, Greek, and Asian tragedies make people feel the irresistible force of unknowable destiny. That is the product of human immaturity. Today's tragedies, the tragedies of socialist society, teach people to strive to learn dialectical materialism, so that their subjective understanding is completely in line with the objective, thereby conquering the objective. Therefore, if such tragedies are created, it will be beneficial to the advancement of socialist society.
    There is also a kind of tragedy in history, that is, as Engels said, "the tragic conflict between the necessary demands of history and the actual impossibility of realizing these demands," such as the failure of every immature revolutionary movement in history: the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, the Paris Commune... and so on. Here, the responsibility for the error is smaller.
    However, there is another kind of tragedy in history, that is, the tragedy of people who are destroyed without any fault of their own, for example, the death of Desdemona in Shakespeare's "Othello." Her death was entirely caused by Iago's despicable cunning. In today's society, this kind of tragedy is the only one, but it cannot be said to be completely absent.
    However, in today's society, when some people see the last kind of tragedy, they always want to blame the destroyed character for a few words for the sake of "comprehensiveness," saying something like "He should also be responsible subjectively!" To this, I can only reply with Chernyshevsky's words; he said, want to find fault with such a character? "Then, even the little lamb in the fable, who goes to the river with wolves to drink, is also at fault? Why did it have to go to the small river where it might encounter wolves, and, more importantly, why didn't it prepare a set of sharp teeth to eat the wolves? We believe that the idea of finding fault with every destroyed person is a very far-fetched idea, and it is so cruel that it is infuriating."

    也论悲剧
    彭鼎
    老舍先生在“论悲剧”（见3月18日人民日报）中提出了“是不是我们今天的社会里已经没有了悲剧现实，自然也就无从产生悲剧作品”的问题，对此，我想讲一点意见。
    我以为，今天的社会主义社会里，当然还有悲剧现实。老舍先生所举的“一个心地并不坏的干部而把好事作坏，以至激起民愤，闹出乱子”，是悲剧，或者“干部不关心子女，以至子女犯了罪”，是悲剧；而斯大林同志的事情，也是一出大悲剧。
    我不知道悲剧的古典定义是什么。但从读过的悲剧作品看来，似乎构成悲剧的，是这样一些情况：人物的主观动机始终是正义的、但主观的认识犯了错误，因而造成主观与客观的矛盾，其结果，他的正义的主观动机被客观的现实所否定了，而且无可挽回。这样，一方面，我们感到这人物的崇高或伟大，另一方面，感到客观现实的严酷，从而引起同情和畏惧之情——对人物的同情和对现实畏惧的痛苦的悲剧感情。
    在这里，人物的正义性是首要的。恶人的毁灭决不会使人发生悲剧感。项羽在乌江自刎时说：“天亡我，非战之罪也。”他最后连主观的战略的错误也不肯承认，但我们还是同情他，把他的结局看作悲剧。该撒被勃鲁脱斯所刺时，说：“你也在内么？那么倒下吧，该撒！”发觉自己过去看错了朋友。我们以为这也是悲剧。这是因为，我们承认两人始终是正义的。但是，有谁说希特勒的自杀和墨索里尼的上绞架是悲剧呢？同样，林黛玉之死，是悲剧；但王熙凤之死，却不是悲剧。恶人得恶报，老百姓从来不以为是悲剧。
    为了伟大目的的自觉的牺牲，不是悲剧，如刘胡兰、董存瑞的结局。只有主观上犯了错误而被客观所否定，而且到了无可挽回的地步时，才成为悲剧。法捷耶夫的名作“毁灭”所反映的一支游击队的毁灭不是悲剧，石达开在大渡河边的复灭，才是悲剧。而主观和客观的矛盾，不但在今天的社会主义社会里，就是将来的共产主义社会里，也还将存在。那么，悲剧总是要产生的，尽管数量要减少，尽管性质会不同，但那深刻性反会增强。因为，对客观完全盲目以及基本上不知道如何认识客观，因而根本无法掌握自己命运的人们，那悲剧，较之现在的，已经基本上知道如何掌握命运却还不免陷于毁灭的人们的悲剧，是不深刻的。
    斯大林的事情，许多人都说是悲剧。但我看，只有“再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”中说得正确；那里面说，“从整个说来，斯大林始终是站在历史潮流前面指导斗争的，他是帝国主义的不可调和的敌人。甚至在他犯错误的时候，他的悲剧也在于，他相信那是捍卫劳动者的利益不受敌人侵害所必需的。”然而，斯大林死了，他没有机会由自己来纠正自己的错误了，这是深刻的悲剧。但若如有些人所说，是他的“愚蠢”的结果，那么，斯大林的事情也就不成其为悲剧了。
    古代的、希腊的和亚洲的悲剧，使人们感到不可知的宿命的不可抵抗。那是人类认识幼稚的产物。现在的悲剧，社会主义社会的悲剧，却教导人们去努力学习辩证唯物主义，使自己的主观完全符合于客观，从而征服客观。所以，如果创造出这样的悲剧来，对社会主义社会的前进是有益的。
    历史上还有一种悲剧，那是，如恩格斯所说，“历史必然的要求与这个要求实际上不可能实现之间的悲剧的冲突，”如历史上每次条件未成熟的革命运动之失败：太平天国、巴黎公社……等等。在这里，错误的责任是较小的。
    但是，历史上也有另外一种悲剧，就是自己毫无过失但遭到灭亡的人们的悲剧，例如，莎士比亚的“奥赛罗”里面的德斯德蒙娜之死。她的死，完全是雅戈的卑劣的狡计所造成的。在今天的社会里，这类的悲剧是仅有的了，但还不能说绝无。
    但是，今天的社会里，有些人，在看到最后一类悲剧时，却为了“全面”，总也要对那遭到毁灭的人物责备几句，说什么“他主观上也应负责任呵！”对于这，我只好用车尔尼雪夫斯基的话来答复；他说过，要从这样的人物中找过失？“那么，甚至寓言中所讲的小羔羊，它到有狼的河边饮水，也有过失了？为什么它偏要到可能遇着狼的小河去呀，而且，主要的，为什么它不自备一副利牙来吃掉狼呀？我们认为：要在每个灭亡者身上找出过失来的这种思想，是十分牵强的思想，而且是残忍到使人愤恨的”。
