	Straw Rope and Snake
	Wu Yan

	"Why are you in such a panic? Look, your nose is bleeding too - did you fall?"
	"Sigh, you know, under my bed, long, yellow, coiled there... Luckily I escaped quickly!"
	"What was it?"
	"It must be a snake! This, I have experience, I was bitten by a snake three years ago, it was the same, long, yellow, coiled there..."
	"You saw the characteristics of the snake clearly three years ago?"
	"Come on, don't be sarcastic! When you get bitten, who has time to worry about that?"
	"So, this time you saw it clearly?"
	"This time I knew it at a glance, I hurried out, who knew I would fall."
	"This time it was a straw rope I put there."
	The so-called empiricists, most of the comrades I meet belong to the type of "bitten by a snake three years ago, afraid of seeing a straw rope": although they take the first time as a lesson or a cautionary tale, in fact, they didn't see it clearly the first time, nor did they see it clearly the second time.

    草绳与蛇
    吴岩
    “那末慌慌张张的干么呀？瞧你鼻子也在流血——跌跤了吧？”
    “咳，你可知道，在我床底下，长长的，黄黄的，盘在那里……幸亏我逃得快！”
    “那是什么呢？”
    “那当然是蛇啊！这个，我有经验，三年前我就给蛇咬过一口的，也是这样，长长的，黄黄的，盘在那里……”
    “三年前你已经把蛇的特征看清楚了？”
    “得了，别说风凉话了！给咬了，谁还顾得上这些个？”
    “那末这一回你看清楚了？”
    “这一回我一看就知道了，我就赶紧往外跑，谁知道跌了一跤。”
    “这一回是我放在那里的一条草绳啊。”
    一般所说的经验主义者，我遇到的却大多是属于“三年前给蛇咬了一口，看见草绳也害怕”这一类型的同志：虽然他们以第一次为借鉴或前车之鉴，实际上却是第一次没有看清楚，第二次也没有看清楚。
