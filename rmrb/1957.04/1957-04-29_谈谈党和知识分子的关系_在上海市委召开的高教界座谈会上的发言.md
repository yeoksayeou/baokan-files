I want to talk about the relationship between the Party and intellectuals. We love the Party, but in the past, we always felt out of sync with the Party organizations in schools. I once considered transferring to another school to teach. I often felt that among the older generation of professors, there were three types of people: the first type obeyed the leaders' opinions completely and could be considered "progressive elements" or "activists," but what they truly thought inside was unknown; the second type said good things on the surface but grumbled behind their backs – there were many such people, you could say they were slick; and then there was a third type of person who spoke their mind, worked hard, and did things well, but had to voice their opinions, and these people were very unpopular. You could call these people "stubborn elements," but there were very few of them, and I am one of these "stubborn elements."

Why does the relationship between the Party and intellectuals have problems? I think there are several reasons:

First, the leadership methods of certain comrades are not suitable for the characteristics of the old intellectuals. Intellectuals value face above all else. If you don't give them face and tear them down, it's worse than killing them. Chinese intellectuals also have a high degree of patriotism, especially those like me who have been abroad. In the past, we were looked down upon everywhere abroad, so we are particularly fond of our motherland. However, if they say something that is not entirely correct or write an article with some shortcomings, and you say their thinking is reactionary, then they will really be angered, and they may not be able to sleep for several nights. Another characteristic of intellectuals is that they value the results of their research labor. This is their life's work, which they value more than their own children. However, it's okay for those in natural sciences, but for those in social sciences, if things aren't handled well, they are simply labeled – reactionary, reactionary, which is really painful! In the past, I worked on collectivism (close to the right-wing of Hegelianism). During ideological remolding, I was repeatedly criticized for not being profound enough and couldn't pass. In fact, the people listening probably didn't understand at all, but it made my nerves even weaker. My research was completely negated, which was heartbreaking! Hegel was an idealist, but he also had some good things, a "rational kernel." Another characteristic of intellectuals is that they are a little greedy for small material advantages. I think the Party should affirm their patriotism, affirm their research labor, take care of their need for face, and gradually educate and transform them.

Second, there is a contradiction between dogmatism and freedom of thought. Many academic and ideological issues are suppressed with the label of reactionary thought, without any reasoning. But thought cannot be suppressed. Even if they say "yes" to your face, they say "no" as soon as they leave. It's not acceptable to be unreasonable.

Third, the nature of the contradictions and the methods of struggle were not clear. During ideological remolding, some old professors were attacked by students who were seventeen or eighteen years old, younger than their own sons. I don't think this approach is good.

These situations all occurred before Premier Zhou's report on the issue of intellectuals. After Premier Zhou's report, especially after the announcement of the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy, the situation completely changed, with significant differences. Old professors have received care in many ways, have a certain status, and are respected by students. Their thinking has also been liberated. Materially, they receive meticulous care, such as housing, priority medical treatment, non-staple food, and cars for official travel, which is very touching. It would be heartless not to be moved, so what else is there to say? The problem now is how to repay the Party, what can we offer? I feel a little panicked. When we argue, we are fierce, but when it comes to producing real results, we are apprehensive. After such improvements, the unity between the Party and intellectuals has strengthened, especially the atmosphere of academic research. In the past, I was just doing my job without enthusiasm, only teaching what others had taught in class, so as not to be labeled with a "hat," thinking that my life was over. But now there is hope, and I want to do some good work.

Does this mean there are no more problems? No, it doesn't. The past estrangement has not been completely eliminated. Intellectuals have deep-seated prejudices, especially some who have not been well taken care of. The side effects of the anti-rightist struggle still need to be further eliminated. Now everything is harmonious on the surface, but in reality, there are many concerns, and people are hesitant. Otherwise, why are some people still afraid to speak freely? Why does our school have over a hundred kinds of English magazines, but only a few people read them?

The solution, I think, is to resolutely implement the Party's policy towards intellectuals and resolutely implement the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a Hundred Schools of Thought Contend" policy. The principle is simple, but it must be resolutely implemented. Specifically, I think we should strengthen personal contact between Party members and non-Party members. Once they become good friends, they can talk about anything, and unity and transformation will be easy. If you see any shortcomings, one person can say: "Old friend, isn't this a little off?" And the other can say: "Yes, yes!" Don't just slap a big label of bourgeois ideology on someone.

Another important point is not to just listen to one-sided reports from below, but to listen to the opinions of non-Party members as much as possible. Like today's meeting, it's very good, and people are speaking their minds. We must resolutely oppose rude attitudes. What's the point of scolding someone for having reactionary thoughts! Have more small, informal conversations, and give fewer grandiose reports (we are still very willing to listen to some important reports and transmissions). Organize more visits to other places; vivid and graphic education is very effective. I am from Hefei. I heard that Hefei's construction is fantastic. Going back to see it will definitely have a good impact.

Regarding academic research, I suggest opening more elective courses, with various schools of thought running concurrently, allowing students to criticize and choose. In particular, if teachers have research results, they should be asked to share them in a course for students to listen to. What's the harm in that? Schools can hold more academic discussions and debates. The journal should not be discontinued but should be run even better.

    谈谈党和知识分子的关系
    ——在上海市委召开的高教界座谈会上的发言
    上海财经学院教授　王惟中
    我想谈谈党和知识分子的关系问题。我们热爱党，可是过去和学校里的党组织总觉得格格不入，我曾想换个学校去教书。我常觉得在老一辈的教授当中有这样三种人：一种是对领导的意见唯命是从，也可算得“进步分子”、“积极分子”吧，可是他们的内心如何，不得而知；第二种人是表面说好，背后却叽叽咕咕，这种人很多，可说是滑头滑脑吧；还有一种人是心里想什么就讲什么，工作拼命干，好好搞，可是有意见一定要讲，这种人很不讨人喜欢。这种人可以说是“顽固派”吧，但是很少，我就是这种“顽固分子”。
    党和知识分子的关系为什么会发生问题呢？我觉得有这几个原因：
    第一，某些同志的领导方法和旧知识分子的特点不相适应，知识分子首先要面子，你不给他面子，撕破他的脸，比杀他的头还难受。中国的知识分子还有高度的爱国心，特别是像我这样到过外国的。过去在外国到处被人瞧不起，对祖国特别热爱。可是，如果他讲了一句不够正确的话，写了一篇有些缺点的文章，就说他的思想反动，那他就真要气死了，可能几夜都睡不着觉。知识分子另一个特点，就是重视自己的研究劳动成果，这是他一生的心血，比自己的儿子看得还重。可是，搞自然科学的还好，搞社会科学的人，弄得不好，就简简单单扣上一顶帽子——反动，反动，这真苦啊！我过去搞全体主义（接近于黑格尔右派的学说），思想改造的时候，一再批判说不深刻，都通不过，其实，听的人可能根本不懂，却搞得我神经更加衰弱，对劳动成果一概抹煞，伤心！黑格尔是唯心主义，可是他也有些好东西，有“合理的内核”。知识分子还有一个特点，就是在物质上要贪一点小便宜。我觉得党要肯定他们爱国，肯定他们的研究劳动，照顾他们爱面子等特点，逐步地予以教育改造。
    第二，教条主义和自由思想有矛盾。很多学术思想问题，都拿反动思想帽子压，讲不出道理来。可是思想这东西是压不服的，即使当面说“是”，出了门就“非”。不讲理是不行的。
    第三，矛盾性质、斗争方式没有弄清楚。在思想改造的时候，有些老教授挨整，整他的是十七八岁的学生，比他的儿子年纪还小。我看这种方式不好。
    这些情况都是在周总理关于知识分子问题报告以前发生的。周总理报告以后，特别是“百家争鸣”的方针宣布以后，情况完全变了，有显著的不同。老教授多方面得到照顾，有了一定的地位，也受到了学生的尊敬，思想也解放了，物质上如住房、优先看病、副食品、因公外出有车等等照顾无微不至，令人感动。不感动是没有良心的，还有什么可讲？现在的问题是如何报答党，有什么东西能够拿出来。我觉得有一点恐慌，吵架的时候声色俱厉，真正要拿货色出来的时候又诚惶诚恐了。经过这样的改善，党和知识分子的团结就加强了，特别是学术研究的空气浓厚了。过去我只是做一天和尚撞一天钟，在课堂里人家没有讲过的我不讲，以免戴上“帽子”，以为自己一生完了。现在却有希望了，要好好搞点东西出来。
    这样是不是没有问题了呢？也不是。过去的隔阂还没有完全消除。知识分子的成见很深，特别是一些还没有很好照顾到的知识分子，肃反的副作用还有待进一步消除。现在表面上一团和气，实际上顾虑多端，束手束脚。否则，为什么有些人还不敢畅所欲言呢？为什么我们学校里有一百多种英文杂志而只有极少的人去看呢？
    解决的办法我觉得就是坚决贯彻党对知识分子的政策，坚决贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针。原则很简单，可是一定要坚决贯彻。具体措施，我觉得应该加强党员和非党员的个人接触，只要变成了好朋友，就可以无话不谈，团结改造就好办了。看到什么缺点，一个就可以说：“老兄，这一点有些不对头吧？”一个说：“对啊！对啊！”不要硬绑绑地扣上一顶资产阶级思想大帽子。
    还有一点很重要，不要单听下边一面的报告，尽可能多听听非党员的意见。像今天的会就很好，话就说出来了。要坚决反对粗暴的态度，骂几个思想反动有什么用！多弄些小型的、谈家常式的谈话，少做些冠冕堂皇的大报告（有些重要的报告和传达我们还是极愿意听的）。多组织一些外地参观，生动的形象教育作用很大。我是合肥人，听说合肥建设好得不得了，回去看看一定会有很好的影响。
    关于学术研究问题，我建议多开些选修课程，各个学派同时开，让学生批判选择。特别是，如果教员有研究成果，就叫他拿出来开课给学生听听。这有什么坏处？学校里可以多开一些学术讨论会、辩论会。学报不要停掉而是要办得更好。
