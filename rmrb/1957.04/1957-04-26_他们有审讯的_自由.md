On April 8th, the Japanese "Asahi Shimbun" published a detailed record of the U.S. Senate Internal Security Subcommittee's interrogation of Tsuru Shigeto, a professor at Hitotsubashi University in Japan who was lecturing in the United States. This record powerfully exposes what "freedom" really means in the "kingdom" of the so-called "free world," the United States!

Morris (Subcommittee Counsel): Is "Lo" your alias as a Communist Party member?

Tsuru: I have never been a Communist Party member.

Morris: Before you came to the United States, did you not participate in the Japanese Communist Youth League?

Tsuru: No, I have never been a member of the Communist Youth League. If necessary, the Japanese authorities can provide proof of this.

Morris: What is the Anti-Imperialist League? Isn't it one of the organizations of the Japanese Communist Party?

Tsuru: You can interpret it however you like, but I don't think it is. I joined the Anti-Imperialist League in 1929 or 1930, when Japan was preparing to invade Manchuria. We young students organized the Anti-Imperialist League to oppose this invasion.

Morris: Were you arrested for participating in these activities?

Tsuru: I was arrested in December 1930 for participating in these activities, and released without prosecution after three and a half months.

Morris: Did you participate in the International Red Aid, one of the Soviet relief organizations?

Tsuru: I don't think I participated.

Morris: Did you have some form of relationship with the national organization of the Japanese Communist Party, "Senki" (Battle Flag)?

Tsuru: "Senki" is a magazine. I have read a few issues, but I have never had any relationship with this magazine.

Morris: Did you contribute to this magazine?

Tsuru: I have never written any papers, commentaries, or other articles.

Morris: Did you join the Communist Party when you were studying at Harvard University?

Tsuru: I have never joined any party anywhere in the world.

Morris: In your letter (note: a letter to Harvard University Professor Barrows), you used the word "we." Who does this refer to?

Tsuru: Besides Lawrence University and Harvard University, I also attended the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and the University of Chicago. At that time, Japan was discussing the war against China. I was critical of the Japanese government's policy towards China. Many people shared the same views as me at the time. Therefore, among the people I knew during my time at Madison, Chicago, and Harvard, there were also so-called leftists. Therefore, the "we" mentioned in this non-public private communication does not mean "we belonging to a certain organization," but simply "we."

Jenner (Republican Senator, former Chairman of the Subcommittee): Who in your "we" are Communists? Name them!

Tsuru: My "we" does not refer to communists.

Jenner: Are you saying leftists?

Tsuru: I am referring to the people I knew.

Jenner: I want to know who "we" all are.

Tsuru: I will try my best to remember.

Jenner: Can't you remember even one person in Wisconsin, Chicago, or Harvard?

Tsuru: Because the contact was not so close, I have forgotten. Maybe I will remember if I read all my letters.

Morris: You said you used the word "we" very generally, but you wrote in the letter:
	"We have various forms of organization for educational purposes, such as labor schools," and the word "organization" is underlined. So, can't you remember who your "we" are? You are an educated person, please don't make fun of this committee.

Tsuru: I am not evading the question. I am trying to sort out the situation when I wrote the letter. I left the letters in my apartment, which proves that these letters did not make me feel uneasy.

Morris: Didn't you ask someone to get these letters back?

Tsuru: There was no such thing.

Morris: You often use "we." This expression means that a specific organization of "we" is necessary.

Jenner: That's the party! There is a need to organize a party!

Tsuru: If you want to confirm that I am a member of the Communist Party or the Communist Youth League, I dare to swear that I have never been a real party member or league member. If what you want to confirm is: I have had contact with communists and even people who are quite close to the Communist Party, then I can say that I have indeed had contact with such people. In the situation in 1930, I may have crossed the boundary of what I thought was appropriate behavior. I was young and pursued so-called adventure. I can imagine myself doing that kind of wrong thing. However, I am definitely not a Communist Party member. I have gradually adopted a critical attitude towards Marxism, not to mention the policies of the Communist Party. This critical attitude of mine is a well-known fact in Japan.

Morris: In January 1954, you wrote an essay, "America's Silent Steps." What do you mean? On the issue of the implementation of the United Nations resolution on the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction, you opposed the US position, pointing out that the United States and Britain distorted the correct reply of the Soviet Union in November 1953.

Tsuru: On this issue, I think there are two aspects. The first is the issue of weapons of mass destruction, and the second is the issue of the US and British governments' refusal to respond to the Soviet memorandum of November 1954. Regarding the first issue, some people suspect that the Japanese army attempted to manufacture weapons of mass destruction during World War II. I have not found conclusive evidence, but I think the Japanese army at least attempted to do so. In post-war Japan, people think of me as an anti-American. This is probably because I have publicly expressed my views on many issues closely related to the United States. First, it is the issue of nuclear weapons testing, and second, it is the political restrictions imposed on Japan's trade with mainland China. In addition, there are the entire US foreign policy issues and the issue of US aid "with lassoes," etc.

Johnston (Democratic Senator): What does "foreign aid with lassoes" mean?

Tsuru: On this point, I criticized it in relation to the US-Japan Mutual Security Program. We received wheat aid from the United States under the Mutual Security Program, and later wheat aid became a form of surplus agricultural product disposal. What I oppose most is the degree of control that the United States advocates in dealing with dollar counterpart funds. Furthermore, I still believe that Japan should not rearm at an excessively rapid pace. The US government is putting pressure on Japan to rearm beyond what I consider appropriate. I think this control over dollar counterpart funds is a kind of "lasso."

Jenner: Dollar counterpart funds are US money. What strange things can you say about using our money!

Tsuru: I think dollar counterpart funds are loans from the US government to the Japanese government.

The above is the testimony of the first day, that is, the record of the interrogation of Tsuru at the public hearing on March 26. The "Asahi Shimbun" on the 9th also published the testimony of the second day. It would take up too much space to copy it all down. Fortunately, to understand American "freedom," the testimony of this day is enough.

Tsuru Shigeto was suddenly summoned by the US Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, supposedly in connection with the subcommittee's investigation of the case of Canadian Ambassador to Egypt Norman. Norman's name appears in the record of the interrogation on the second day. But the ambitions of those anti-communist spies are definitely not to investigate a mere Norman. They questioned more names, including some well-known figures in Japan; they also asked Tsuru to provide a "list" of people he could remember who were communists or suspected of being communists, that is, a blacklist. In the eyes of these heroes and good men who call themselves saviors of the "free world," perhaps there is no place in the world where they have no right to interfere, because they are the incarnation of "freedom" in the "free world." In the face of their "freedom," all human rights and dignity, democracy and justice, and even the sovereignty of other countries, should be "silent" and "avoid."

Tsuru Shigeto was originally invited to Harvard University to lecture as a "messenger" of US-Japan cultural exchange. He said that he "wanted to go to testify as a guest of the United States," but "different customs prevail every thousand miles, and different habits exist every hundred miles." He may not have anticipated that the "hospitality" of American congressmen would be like this. A Japanese cultural figure indignantly asked: "Why must we answer this kind of rogue interrogation?" Naturally, answering is also a kind of "freedom"; for this Japanese professor who deeply regrets making "mistakes" when he was young and is deeply ashamed of his "youthful recklessness" and "pursuit of so-called adventure," he has the "freedom" to "criticize" Marxism; he also has the "freedom" to express "loyalty" and "cooperation" to the committee, but the price he pays for these "freedoms" is enormous humiliation, not only his personal humiliation, but also the humiliation of a nation. It is no wonder that many Japanese people with a strong sense of national self-esteem feel indignant about the "Tsuru incident" and feel "regret" for his answers.

It should be said that obedient "educated" people like Tsuru are exactly the good targets for those various committees in the United States that take McCarthyism as their soul. They want to "extract" things from this kind of person, display their authority, and stir up trouble. But they cannot always encounter such good prey. Among the people they have interrogated, about one-third have exercised their "right to remain silent," that is, they have adopted the method of "Xu Shu entering Cao Ying," not saying a word. A few days ago, I also saw a news item from Agence France-Presse:

"American journalist William Price has been sentenced to three months in prison and fined $500 for refusing to answer a question from a Senate investigating committee asking whether he was a Communist."

In the dictionary of the American rulers, "freedom" is interpreted in this way: they are allowed to have the "freedom" to interrogate, and you are not allowed to have the freedom to refuse to answer. Their "freedom" to interrogate is incompatible with the freedom of ordinary people to live honestly according to their beliefs. Those who would rather go to jail and be fined than despise the "freedom" of interrogation deserve our deep respect, not only for their unyieldingness and integrity, but also because they represent a hope: with more and more such people, the "freedom" of McCarthyist interrogation will not be able to run rampant and do whatever it wants.

    他们有审讯的“自由”
    刘仲平
    4月8日日本“朝日新闻”发表了美国参议院国内安全小组委员会传讯在美讲学的日本一桥大学教授都留重人的详细记录。这个记录，有力地暴露了在所谓“自由世界”的“王国”的美国，究竟什么是“自由”！
    摩里斯（小组委员会顾问）：“罗”是你作为共产党员的化名吗？
    都留：我从来没有作过共产党员。
    摩里斯：你在到美国来之前，没有参加过日本共产主义青年团吗？
    都留：没有，我从来没有作过共青团团员。如果有必要，日本当局会给我证明的。
    摩里斯：反帝同盟是什么？不是日本共产党的组织之一吗？
    都留：随便您怎么解释都可以，但我不认为是那样。我参加反帝同盟是在1929、1930年，当时日本正准备开始侵略满洲。我们青年学生为了反对这一侵略，才组织了反帝同盟。
    摩里斯：你是因为参与这些活动被逮捕的吗？
    都留：是因为参与这些活动，于1930年12月被捕，三个半月之后，未经起诉即被释放的。
    摩里斯：你参加过苏联救济机关之一的国际主义救济团体吗？
    都留：我想是没有参加过。
    摩里斯：你同日共的全国性组织“战旗”是不是有过某种形式的关系？
    都留：“战旗”是一个杂志。我读过几本，但同这个杂志没有发生过一次关系。
    摩里斯：没向这个杂志投过稿吗？
    都留：论文、评论以及其它文章，什么都没有写过。
    摩里斯：你在哈佛大学读书时，没有加入过共产党吗？
    都留：我在世界上任何地方都没有加入过党。
    摩里斯：你在信（注：给美国哈佛大学教授巴里的信）里使用过“我们”这一个词，这指的是谁？
    都留：我除了劳伦斯大学、哈佛大学之外，还上过麦迪逊大学、芝加哥大学。当时日本正在讨论对中国的战争。我对日本政府的对华政策是抱批判态度的。当时同我抱有同样见解的人很多。所以，我在麦迪逊、芝加哥、哈佛大学时代认识的人们里面，也有一般所说的左翼分子。因此在这封非公开的私人通信里所说的“我们”，并不是“属于某一组织的我们”的意思，只不过是“我们”而已。
    真纳（共和党参议员、前小组委员会主席）：你说的“我们”里，都有谁是共产主义分子，举出名字来！
    都留：我说的“我们”，指的不是共产主义者。
    真纳：是说左翼吗？
    都留：我是说我所认识的人们。
    真纳：我想知道“我们”都是谁。
    都留：我尽量想一想看。
    真纳：在威斯康星、芝加哥、哈佛，一个人都想不出来吗？
    都留：因为交往不那么密切，忘记了。把我的信全部读一遍，也许会想得起来。
    摩里斯：你说你是非常泛泛地使用了“我们”这个词，可是你在信里写道：
  “我们已经为了教育的目的，有了各种形式的组织，例如劳动学校”，而且在“组织”之下还划了横线。这样，你说的“我们”都是谁，还想不起来吗？你是个有教养的人，请不要开本委员会的玩笑。
    都留：我不是逃避质问。我是想整理一下写信当时的情况。我曾把信件留在公寓里，这也证明这些信对我并没有什么于心不安的地方。
    摩里斯：你不是托过什么人想把这些信弄回去吗？
    都留：没有过这样的事。
    摩里斯：你常常使用“我们”，这种表现法就是说对于“我们”特定的组织是必要的。
    真纳：这就是党！有组织党的必要！
    都留：如果您想确认我是共产党或共青团的党员或团员，我敢发誓说，我从来没有当过真正的党员或团员。如果您想确认的事实是：我曾经同共产党员以至相当靠近共产党的人们有过交往，那末我可以说，我的确同这样的人有过交往。在1930年那种形势下，我也许越过了我认为是适当的行为的界限。年纪轻，追求所谓冒险，我可以想像出来干那种错事的自己。但是，我决不是一个共产党员。我对于共产党的政策固不用说，对于马克思主义也逐渐采取了批判态度。我的这种批判态度，在日本是周知的事实。
    摩里斯：你在1954年1月写过一篇论文“美国的无声的脚步”，是什么意思？在关于联合国通过的有关禁止大规模毁灭性武器的决议的执行问题上，你反对美国的立场，指摘说美、英两国歪曲了1953年11月苏联的正确的答复。
    都留：对于这个问题，我以为有两个方面。第一是关于大规模毁灭性武器的问题，第二是美、英两国政府对于1954年11月苏联的备忘录拒不作答的问题。关于第一个问题，有人怀疑日本军队在第二次世界大战中曾企图制造大规模毁灭性武器。我没有找到确凿的证据，但我认为日本军队至少是企图这样作过的。在战后的日本，人们认为我是一个反美主义者。这大约是因为对于许多同美国有密切关系的问题，我公开地发表了我的见解的缘故。首先是对于核武器试验问题，其次是对于加给日本对中国大陆的贸易的政治限制问题。此外还有对于美国的整个外交政策问题以及美国的援助“带有套索”问题等等。
    约翰斯顿（民主党参议员）：“对外援助带有套索”是什么意思？
    都留：关于这一点，我是从日美共同安全计划的关系上加以批判的。我们根据共同安全计划从美国得到了小麦援助，其后，小麦援助又变成了处理剩余农产品的形式。我最反对的是在处理美元对等资金问题上美国所主张的控制程度。再有，现在我仍然认为日本不应以过快的速度重整军备。美国政府施加压力逼迫日本重新武装，超过了我认为适当的限度。我以为对于美元对等资金的这种控制就是一种“套索”。
    真纳：美元对等资金是美国的钱。用我们的钱，你有什么怪话可说！
    都留：我认为美元对等资金是美国政府借给日本政府的贷款。
    上面是第一天的证辞，即3月26日在公开意见听取会上对都留的传讯的记录。9日的“朝日新闻”还载有第二天的证辞。全抄下来所占篇幅过多，好在要了解美国的“自由”，有这一天的证辞也就足够了。
    都留重人突然受到美国参议院国内安全小组委员会的传讯，据说是同这个小组委员会追查加拿大驻埃及大使诺曼的事件有关。诺曼的名字，出现在第二天传讯的记录上。但那些反共探子们的志向，决不在于追究区区诺曼一人。他们追问到更多的名字，其中也包括日本的某些知名之士；他们还要求都留提供一张他能够记得起来的共产主义者或有共产主义嫌疑的人的“一览表”，也就是黑名单。在这些自命为“自由世界”救世主的英雄好汉们看来，也许世界上没有任何地方是他们无权插手的，因为他们就是“自由世界”的“自由”的化身，在他们的“自由”面前，什么人权和尊严、民主和正义，以至他国的主权等等，都应该“肃静”“回避”。
    都留重人原是作为日美文化交流的“使者”，应聘去哈佛大学讲学的。他说他“想以美国客人的身份前去作证”，但“千里不同风，百里不同俗”，美国议员们的“待客之礼”竟是这样，这也许是他始所未曾料及的吧。日本的一位文化人士愤慨地问道：“对于这种流氓式的讯问，为什么必须回答不可呢？”自然，回答，也是一种“自由”；在这位深悔年轻时作了“错事”，深以“少年孟浪”、“追求所谓冒险”为耻的日本教授来说，“批判”马克思主义，有他的“自由”；对委员会表示“忠诚”和“协力”，也有他的“自由”，不过他为这些“自由”付出的代价，却是莫大的屈辱，不仅是他个人的屈辱，而且是一个民族的屈辱。这就难怪众多的具有强烈民族自尊感的日本人大为“都留事件”感到义愤，并为他的回答觉得“遗憾”了。
    应该说，像都留这样听话的“有教养的”人，正是美国那些以麦卡锡主义为其灵魂的各式各样的委员会的好对象。他们正是要从这类人物身上“掏”出东西来，施展其威严，兴风作浪的。但他们也并不能经常碰到这样好的猎获物。受他们审讯过的人们中间，就有三分之一左右的人行使过“沉默权”，即采取“徐庶进曹营”的办法，一言不发。前几天还看到法新社的一条消息：
    “美国记者威廉·普赖斯为了拒绝回答参议院一个调查委员会问他是否共产党人的问题，被判三个月监禁并科以五百美元罚金。”
    在美国统治者的字典里，“自由”就是这样解释的：许他们有审讯的“自由”，不许你有拒不回答的自由。他们的审讯“自由”，同普通人们按照自己所信正直地生活下去的自由是不两立的。那些宁肯以坐监和受罚的代价来蔑视审讯的“自由”的人们，值得我们深深敬重，不仅由于他们的不屈和气节，而且也由于他们代表着一种希望：这样的人多了起来，麦卡锡主义的审讯“自由”，就将不可能那样猖狂肆虐，为所欲为了。（附图片）
