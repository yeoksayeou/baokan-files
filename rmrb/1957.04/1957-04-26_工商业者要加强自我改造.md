    Industrialists and Businessmen Must Strengthen Self-Remolding
    Chen Qingzheng, Standing Committee Member of the Shanghai Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association

    After listening to the dissemination of Chairman Mao's recent speeches, I have further realized the spirit of seeking truth from facts in Marxism-Leninism. Chairman Mao told us that there are contradictions among the people in socialist society. The problem lies in how to deal with them correctly. This requires a spirit of seeking truth from facts. Because only by admitting "there is such a thing" can we then "seek its truth." The contradictions among the people are an objective existence, so we should neither exaggerate them nor conceal them. Instead, we should strive to make our understanding of contradictions and methods of dealing with them as "true" as possible, and eliminate the "false" as much as possible. Only in this way can we continuously and correctly resolve contradictions.

    I am a member of the China Democratic National Construction Association, an industrialist and businessman. In connection with my work, I have the following points of understanding:

    After the high tide of joint state-private ownership of capitalist industry and commerce, the China Democratic National Construction Association held its Second Plenary Session last November, and raised the issue that industrialists and businessmen still have duality. Many industrialists and businessmen were initially unconvinced after hearing this. After discussion, although they admitted that there was still duality, they were still unconvinced in their thinking. They believed that if industrialists and businessmen have duality, what class elements do not have duality? If we are to remold, everyone should remold; if we are not to remold, no one should remold. In Chairman Mao's speech this time, this issue was also further resolved for us in a pragmatic way. Chairman Mao told us that workers must also be remolded. He said: Engels said that in the midst of class struggle, the working class transforms the whole society and also transforms itself.

    May I ask, what is it that we industrialists and businessmen need to remold at present? It is mainly to remold thoughts and behaviors that are not conducive to gradually eliminating exploitation and not conducive to building socialism. Are there such thoughts and behaviors among industrialists and businessmen at present? Yes, there are. To give a more obvious example: Some people believe that a fixed interest rate of seven years, only purchasing 35%, is not a complete purchase. We can ask again, will this kind of thinking arise among workers, and does it need to be remolded? Of course not, and it does not need to be remolded. Therefore, although workers also need to be remolded, due to the different classes, the requirements and content of remolding are certainly different. This is an objective fact, not someone's subjective imagination. I think that we industrialists and businessmen should face reality, strengthen self-education and self-remolding, so as not to disappoint Chairman Mao's education of us.

    From the issue of duality, I am reminded of the dual relationship between industrialists and businessmen in enterprise work, which is both a cooperative working relationship and a class relationship. Some industrialist and businessman friends are afraid of hearing the words "class relationship" and prefer not to mention the phrase "class relationship still exists." They believe that one of the reasons why industrialists and businessmen are somewhat hesitant in their enterprise work today is because of the existence of class relations, the existence of state-private relations, and the existence of relations between employees and private parties, creating a gulf between each other. If there were no such gulf, the enthusiasm of the private personnel might be given greater play. This statement is one aspect. However, I have also heard another view, that in some places, the existence of class relations is also considered valuable. For example, some friends are older and not very familiar with enterprise work, but as a result of personnel arrangements, some have become managers or factory directors. So they honestly said: "This is entirely the government's consideration. If I were not an industrialist and businessman, I am afraid I would not be able to become a manager or factory director." Therefore, I think this is another issue that should be treated with a spirit of seeking truth from facts. Although classes have been basically eliminated today, and although this dual relationship will gradually transform into a single cooperative working relationship in the future, in the current situation, the existence of this dual relationship is undoubtedly determined by objective reality. The problem is not whether we are afraid to hear it or not, whether we want to mention it or not, but how we should treat this dual relationship with a pragmatic and correct attitude, and how to create conditions through continuous efforts to strive to gradually transform this dual relationship into a single cooperative working relationship in the future.

    We cannot imagine that industrialists and businessmen today want the government to give them different treatment and care from employees in life and work, while at the same time denying the existence of dual relationships. This kind of purely subjective thinking that ignores reality is not good for one's own remolding. To try to eliminate the "gulf" between public and private and shorten the distance between public and private in this way is probably like climbing a tree to catch fish. So I think honestly facing reality is one of the important prerequisites for us industrialists and businessmen to accept remolding.

    After the joint venture, our industrialist and businessman friends often raised such a question when they talked heart to heart: In our work, we must boldly put forward opinions, but also prevent being seen as arrogant and complacent; we must humbly listen to other people's opinions, but also prevent being seen as hesitant. The boundary between the two is difficult to grasp, and we often feel caught in a dilemma, at a loss for what to do. I also struggled with this issue for a while. Regarding this issue, I have received clear inspiration from the spirit of Chairman Mao's recent speech. The reason why we are both afraid of being bold and afraid of being humble is simply because we are afraid that our opinions are incorrect, afraid of making mistakes, and afraid of being criticized. As a state public servant, it is right to strive not to make mistakes or to make fewer mistakes. The question is whether the purpose of our opinions is for socialism? If the opinions we put forward are beneficial to socialism, we should boldly put them forward. If others think the opinion is wrong and put forward a better opinion, I should humbly accept it. Conversely, I should have the same attitude towards other people's opinions. Moreover, in the correct opinions, there may be incorrect parts. In the incorrect opinions, there may also be correct parts. It is better to put forward an opinion than not to put forward an opinion. We should strive not to make mistakes or to make fewer mistakes, but we should never be afraid of putting forward opinions, and even less should we be afraid of being criticized. In particular, we should not be afraid of putting forward opinions and afraid of being criticized because of personal gains and losses. Although this issue is a matter of attitude and method, it is essentially a matter of position, that is, a concrete test of "destroying capitalism and establishing socialism." Therefore, the key to solving this problem lies in how we can establish more of a sense of ownership, truly achieve speaking out without reservation, and at the same time be able to correct mistakes if we have them, and not be afraid of criticism.

    However, on this issue, in addition to we industrialists and businessmen first striving to break down concerns and establish a sense of ownership, we also hope that the public side in the joint venture enterprise will strengthen its leadership over the private side, give it the necessary support and assistance, and often affirm the "correct" parts of their opinions, while pointing out the "incorrect" parts, so that they can continuously improve their ideological level, clarify the direction of their efforts, and make more contributions to the socialist cause.

### 工商业者要加强自我改造

    工商业者要加强自我改造
    民主建国会上海市分会常务委员　陈清琤
    听了毛主席最近几次讲话的传达以后，使我进一步体会到马克思列宁主义实事求是的精神。毛主席告诉我们，在社会主义社会中，人民内部是有矛盾的。问题在于如何正确处理。这就需要实事求是的精神。因为只有承认“有其事”，然后才能“求其是”。人民内部的矛盾，既是客观的存在，那就既不应该把它夸大，也不应该把它掩蔽，而是应该把对矛盾的看法和处理矛盾的方法，尽可能地求其“是”，尽可能地去其“非”。只有这样，才能有利于不断地、正确地解决矛盾。
    我是民主建国会的会员，一个工商业者。联系到我的工作，有如下几点体会：
    资本主义工商业公私合营高潮以后，去年11月，民主建国会召开二中全会，提出了目前工商业者还存在两面性的问题。不少工商业者听了，起初不服气。经过讨论，虽然承认还有两面性，但在思想上仍有不服气的地方。认为工商业者有两面性，其他阶级分子，何尝没有两面性？要改造，大家改造；不改造，大家不改造。在毛主席这次讲话中，对于这一问题，也给我们实事求是地进一步解决了。毛主席告诉我们，工人也要改造。他说：恩格斯就说过，工人阶级在阶级斗争中间，改造整个社会，也改造了工人阶级自己。
    试问，目前我们工商业者要改造的是什么呢？主要是改造不利于逐步消灭剥削和不利于建设社会主义的思想行为。目前工商业者中间，有没有这种思想行为呢？有。举一个比较显著的例子：有人认为定息七年，只购买了35％，还不是完全购买。我们可以再问一问，这种思想，工人当中会不会产生，要不要改造？当然没有，也不需要改造。因此，工人虽然也要改造，但由于阶级不同，改造的要求与内容当然也就不同了。这是客观的事实，不是那一个人主观的想像。我想，我们工商业者，应该正视现实，加强自我教育和自我改造，才不辜负毛主席对我们的教育。
    从两面性问题，使我联想到目前工商业者在企业工作中，既是共事合作关系，又存在阶级关系的这一双重关系问题。有些工商业者朋友怕听“阶级关系”四个字，最好不提“阶级关系还存在”这句话。他们认为今天工商业者在企业工作当中之所以有些缩手缩脚，其原因之一，就是由于阶级关系的存在，由于公私关系的存在，由于职工与私方之间关系的存在，在彼此之间划成一条鸿沟。如果没有这条鸿沟，则私方人员的积极性，可能有更大的发挥。这种说法，是一方面。可是，同时也听到另外一种说法，就是在某些地方，觉得阶级关系的存在，也还有其可贵的地方。例如有些朋友，年龄大了一些，对企业工作，也不太熟悉，而人事安排的结果，有的则当上了经理或厂长。于是他们老老实实说：“这完全是政府的照顾。如果我不是一个工商业者，就恐怕当不上经理或厂长的”。因此，我认为这又是一个应该用实事求是的精神来对待的问题。虽然今天阶级已经基本消灭，虽然这种双重关系，今后将逐渐转变成为单一的共事合作关系，但在当前，这种双重关系的存在，无疑又是客观现实所决定的。问题不在于怕听不怕听，要提不要提，而是我们应该如何以实事求是的精神，积极正确的态度，来对待目前这种双重关系，以至如何通过不断努力，创造条件，争取把这种双重关系，在今后逐渐转变成为单一的共事合作关系。
    我们不能想像，今天工商业者既要政府在生活上、工作上给予不同于职工的待遇和照顾，同时却又否定双重关系的存在。这种无视现实纯主观的想法，对自己的改造，没有好处。要想以这种方法，来消除公私之间的“鸿沟”，缩短公私之间的距离，恐怕更是缘木而求鱼。所以我认为老老实实，正视现实，是我们工商业者接受改造的重要提前之一。
    合营以后，我们工商业者朋友，在相互促膝谈心的时候，常常还提出了这样一个问题，就是我们在工作之中，既要大胆提出意见，又要防止被目为骄傲自满；既要虚心听取别人意见，又要防止被目为缩手缩脚。二者之间的分寸，很难掌握，常常感觉左右为难，进退失据。我也曾经为这个问题苦闷过一个时期。对于这一问题，我又在毛主席最近讲话的精神中得到明确启示。我们所以既怕大胆，又怕虚心，无非是怕意见提得不对、怕犯错误，怕被批评。作为一个国家公职人员，应该力求不犯错误或少犯错误，这是对的。问题在于我们提出意见的目的，是否为了社会主义？如果我们所提的意见，有利于社会主义，就应该大胆提出去。如果别人认为意见不对，提出更好的意见，我就应该虚心接受。反之，我对别人的意见，也应抱同样的态度。而且在对的意见之中，可能有不对的部分。不对的意见之中，也可能有对的部分。提总比不提好。我们应该力求不犯错误或少犯错误，但决不应该怕提意见，更不应该怕被批评。特别不应该为了考虑个人得失，而怕提意见和怕被批评。这一问题，虽然是一个态度和方法问题，但实质上就是一个立场问题，也就是一个“破资本主义，立社会主义”的具体考验问题。所以，解决这一问题的关键，还是在于我们如何能够建立起更多的主人翁思想，真正做到知无不言，同时又能够做到有错必改，不怕批评。
    但是，在这一问题上，除了我们工商业者自己首先应该努力打破顾虑，建立起主人翁思想以外，我们还希望合营企业中的公方，加强对私方的领导，给以应有的支持和帮助，经常肯定他们意见中的“是”的部分，同时指出其中“非”的部分，使其不断提高思想水平，明确努力方向，为社会主义事业作出更多贡献。
