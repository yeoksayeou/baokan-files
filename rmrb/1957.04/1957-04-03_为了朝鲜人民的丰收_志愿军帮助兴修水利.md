Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 2nd -- The "Unjong Canal" and "Ryongchon-ri Dam" projects, built with the help of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army for the Korean people, broke ground on April 1st and 2nd respectively. On the morning of the 1st, Li Myong-seok, Vice-Chairman of the South Pyongan Province People's Committee of Korea, and Feng Wolin, head of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, participated in the groundbreaking ceremony for the No. 2 dam, the most difficult part of the "Unjong Canal" project. They personally shoveled the first spadeful of earth on the hard frozen soil. Then, countless shovels and picks swung in unison, and the slogan "For a bountiful harvest for the Korean people, attack the frozen soil!" resounded in the mountains and fields.

On the first day of work, a certain unit's artillery company completed three times its work quota. The Korean "Minchong Shock Brigade" members in the labor ranks were very active.

    为了朝鲜人民的丰收
    志愿军帮助兴修水利
    据新华社平壤2日电　中国人民志愿军帮助朝鲜人民建设的“云井水渠”和“龙川里水坝”等工程，在4月1、2日先后破土动工。1日早晨，朝鲜平安南道人民委员会副委员长李明锡和志愿军某部首长冯挖林参加了“云井水渠”工程最艰巨的二号水坝的开工典礼。他们亲自在坚硬的冻土上铲了第一锹土，接着，无数把锹镐一齐挥舞，山野里响起“为了朝鲜人民的丰收，向冻土进攻”的口号声。
    某部炮兵连在开工的第一天，就完成了工作定额的三倍。在劳动行列里的朝鲜“民青突击队员”们都很积极。
