Xinhua News Agency, April 3rd: The Beijing meeting of the Executive Committee of the International Organization of Journalists (IOJ) opened in Beijing today.

    IOJ Vice President Mrs. K.M. Rydberg delivered the opening address. She said that China was where papermaking was invented for the first time in human history, and the earliest invention of movable type printing. She pointed out that the most beneficial creation in this regard is that the people themselves can become the masters of the country's papermaking industry and publishing事业 [shìyè: undertaking; cause; enterprise]. Today, the Chinese people have become the masters of their paper mills, printing plants, newspapers, and news agencies. She expressed her gratitude to the Chinese hosts.

    Mrs. Rydberg stated that we have an obligation to do our utmost to strive for cooperation and solidarity among journalists worldwide.

    Deng Tuo, Chairman of the All-China Journalists Association, delivered a welcoming speech at the meeting, extending warm congratulations on the convening of the meeting in Beijing. He said that it is our glorious duty as Chinese journalists to contribute to the cause of friendly cooperation among journalists from various countries.

    Deng Tuo said, we believe that journalists from various countries, even if they have many differences in political thought, national customs, and religious beliefs, can still cooperate in a friendly manner as long as they have good intentions towards each other. We do not want to impose anything on others, and we have no "iron curtain." Here, the door of friendship is open. On the contrary, the US government, which proclaims itself the master of the "free world," refuses to approve the requests of many American journalists to come to China for interviews, which shows that the so-called iron curtain is over there and not here. All peace-loving, democratic, and upright journalists should rise up and break through this obstacle. We must unite all forces to oppose the dark forces of US imperialism.

    Deng Tuo introduced the situation of the Chinese journalistic community's contacts and engagements with journalists' organizations from twenty-one countries and journalists' organizations and individuals from fifty-one countries over the past seven years.

    IOJ President Jean-Maurice Hermann delivered a report at the meeting. He talked about issues such as cooperation between the IOJ and UNESCO, the IOJ's objectives, guaranteeing freedom of speech for the press without being manipulated by financial forces, and the training of journalists. In conclusion, Hermann said in his report that we do not want to work for war; we want to open the door to peace. Therefore, we are always looking for every opportunity to work together with all our comrades and colleagues in all countries of the world. (Abstracts of Hermann's report are published on page 4)

    争取全世界新闻工作者的合作和团结
    国际新闻工作者协会执委会议开幕
    据新华社3日讯　国际新闻工作者协会执行委员会北京会议今天在北京开幕。
    国际新闻工作者协会副主席克·麦·里德堡夫人致开幕词。她说，在中国，人类历史上第一次发明了造纸的方法，最早发明了活字版的印刷术。她指出，在这方面最有益的创造是人民自己能够成为国家的造纸工业和出版事业的主人。今天，中国人民已经成为他们的造纸厂、印刷厂、报纸和通讯社的主人。她对中国主人表示谢意。
    里德堡夫人表示，我们有义务尽我们的所能，来进行努力，争取达到全世界新闻工作者之间的合作和团结。
    中华全国新闻工作者协会主席邓拓在会上致欢迎词，他对会议在北京召开表示热烈祝贺。他说，我们中国新闻工作者能为各国新闻界友好合作的事业出一分力量，这是我们光荣的义务。
    邓拓说，我们相信，各国的新闻工作者，即便在政治思想、民族习惯、宗教信仰等方面有许多不同，但是，只要彼此有良好的愿望，也是可以友好合作的。我们不希望把任何东西强加于人，我们也没有什么“铁幕”，在我们这里，友谊之门是敞开的；倒是口口声声自命为“自由世界”的主人的美国政府，对于许多美国记者到中国来采访的请求，却拒绝批准，可见所谓铁幕原来是在彼而不在此。一切爱好和平民主的正直的新闻工作者应该起来冲破这个障碍。我们要团结一切力量，反对美国帝国主义这个黑暗势力。
    邓拓在会上介绍了中国新闻界七年来同二十一个国家的记者组织和五十一个国家的记者组织和个人所建立的联系和接触的情况。
    国际新闻工作者协会主席让·莫·埃尔曼在会上作了报告。他谈到了有关国际新闻工作者协会同联合国教育科学文化组织之间的合作、国际新闻工作者协会的宗旨、保证新闻界有言论自由而不受金融势力的操纵，以及记者的培养和训练等问题。埃尔曼在报告中最后说，我们不愿意为战争而工作，我们愿意打开和平的大门。因此，我们总是在寻求一切机会同我们世界各国的所有同志们和同行们共同工作。（埃尔曼报告摘要刊载第四版）
