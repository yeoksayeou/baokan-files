    No Disruption of the State Monopoly for Cotton Cloth!
    The Lingyun Ce and Lianggezhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperatives in Yi County, Hebei, privately printed six thousand one hundred and two *chi* of cotton cloth coupons in five denominations—half a *chi*, one *chi*, two *chi*, three *chi*, and four *chi*—from January 1955 to the first quarter of this year. These cloth coupons were neither registered when issued nor when collected, and no expiration date was specified, allowing the masses to use them indefinitely. The Bozhen Textile Company's business office also privately printed cloth coupons, and the Gao Chengzi and Donggezhuang villages in the Zhenzi Town area of Luan County also privately printed over five thousand six hundred *chi* of temporary cloth coupons, all of which seriously affected the state's planned supply of cotton cloth.
    The retail units at the grassroots level in Dingxing County universally collected and used the second-period cloth coupons in advance. According to incomplete statistics, the supply and marketing cooperatives at the grassroots level turned in over forty-two thousand *chi* of second-period cloth coupons to the textile company in January and February of this year. On March 6th, the Gucheng Supply and Marketing Cooperative submitted over twenty-six thousand *chi* of second-period cloth coupons in one go.
    Due to lax enforcement of the coupon-based supply system, the thirteen grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in Gucheng County had a total deficit of over six hundred and eighty thousand *chi* of cloth coupons by February of this year (including natural wastage and the number of cloth scraps for which no coupons were collected).
    The Hebei Provincial Department of Supervision, in conjunction with relevant departments, has inspected and corrected the above situation.

    不许破坏棉布统购政策！
    河北易县凌云册、梁各庄供销社自1955年1月至今年第一季度私自印制了半尺、一尺、二尺、三尺、四尺等五种购布证共六千一百零二尺。这些布票发出和收回都没有进行登记，也没有规定使用期限，群众可以长期使用。私自印制布票的还有泊镇纺织品公司经营处，滦县榛子镇区高城子、董各庄两个乡也私印临时购布证共五千六百多尺，这都严重地影响了国家对棉布的计划供应。
    定兴县各基层零售单位，普遍提前收用二期布票，据不完全的统计，今年1、2月份各基层供销社交纺织品公司二期布票达四万二千多尺。固城供销社在3月6日一次就交了二万六千多尺二期布票。
    由于执行凭票供应不严格，固城县十三个基层供销社到今年2月共亏缺布票达六十八万多尺（包括自然伤耗和布头不收布票数）。
    上述情况，河北省监察厅已会同有关方面检查纠正。　　坚言
