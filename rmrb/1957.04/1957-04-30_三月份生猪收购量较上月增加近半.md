    March Live Pig Procurement Volume Increases Nearly Half Compared to Last Month

    (Our newspaper reports) This March, the number of pigs purchased by food companies nationwide increased by 49.1% compared to February, and 22.6% compared to the same period last year. Henan Province saw the fastest increase in procurement volume, with purchases in early March increasing by 189% compared to the same period last year. As a result, pork supply in various regions increased by 2.27% in March compared to February (according to general patterns, February has the largest meat supply volume in the whole year, because the Spring Festival is in February), and 51.6% compared to the same period last year. However, due to the uneven growth in procurement and supply volumes across regions, the pork supply situation in some individual areas remains relatively tight.

    Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued the decision on developing pig production and the State Council notified various regions to adjust live pig procurement prices in February this year, the enthusiasm of farmers in raising and selling pigs has greatly increased. Wang Jinhua, a cadre of the Lingyuan District Agricultural Cooperative in Nanjing, sold a fat pig to the food company the day after the price adjustment, earning twelve yuan more than before. He said in public with emotion: "How much grain can be bought with these extra twelve yuan! I must mobilize everyone to raise more pigs and support national industrialization!" Song Baokuan, a farmer from Taixian County, Jiangsu, famous for its pig production, said after selling his pigs: "Selling pigs this time makes me even happier than buying three mu of land in the old society." In An'guang Township in the northern suburbs of Tianjin, fifteen households held "family meetings" and each planned to raise four pigs.

    The average increase in the national live pig procurement price was 14.26%. According to statistics from twelve provinces and cities, farmers can earn about 200 to 230 jin of unprocessed grain by raising a pig weighing 140 jin. According to this year's national pig procurement plan estimates, pig farmers across the country will earn approximately 180 million yuan more than before the price increase.

    While adjusting procurement prices, various regions have also changed the method of determining procurement prices in producing areas based on sales prices in marketing areas, reducing regional price differences. According to statistics from some remote mountainous areas in nineteen provinces and regions, the increase in live pig procurement prices in these areas exceeded the average increase in their respective provinces by 70.77%, and the prices in various adjacent regions have been basically leveled. This will powerfully promote the rapid development of live pig production in remote areas. To facilitate farmers' sales of live pigs, various regions have also simplified the complex pig specifications and grades. Guangdong and Guangxi also stipulated that farmers holding meat retention preferential coupons would be given a 5% discount below the retail price.

    With the increase in live pig procurement prices, the market for piglets is currently unprecedentedly active, with supply falling short of demand in most areas, and prices soaring. The price of piglets in Nanyang County, Henan Province, originally 4 jiao per jin, rose to 8 jiao, 1 yuan, and even 1.2 yuan in March. In Luliang County, Yunnan Province, the price per jin of piglets rose from 8 jiao to 1.8 yuan. If this problem is not resolved in a timely manner, it will offset some of the increased income from raising the price of fat pigs. (Ji Han)

### 三月份生猪收购量较上月增加近半

    三月份生猪收购量较上月增加近半
    本报讯　今年3月份，全国各地食品公司的购猪数量较2月份上升49.1％，较去年同时期上升22.6％。收购数量增加最快的是河南省，这个省3月上旬收购量较去年同时期增加189％。因此，3月份各地猪肉供应量较2月份增加2.27％（按一般规律2月份是全年供肉量最多的月份，因为春节在2月），比去年同时期增加51.6％。但是，由于各地收购量和供应量的增长不平衡，个别地区的猪肉供应情况仍较紧张。
    自从今年2月中共中央和国务院发布关于发展养猪生产的决定和国务院通知各地调整生猪收购价格后，各地农民对养猪和卖猪的积极性大大提高。南京陵园区农业社干部王金华在调价后的第二天就把一头肥猪卖给食品公司，比以前多卖了十二元，他感动地当众说：“这多卖的十二元，能买多少粮食！我一定要动员大家多养猪，支援国家工业化！”以产猪著名的江苏泰县农民宋宝宽卖了猪以后说：“这次卖猪比在旧社会买三亩田心里还高兴”。天津北郊安光乡有十五户召开“家务会议”，每户计划养猪四头。
    这次全国生猪收购价格平均提升幅度为14.26％。据十二个省、市的统计，农民养一头一百四十斤重的猪，可获得约二百到二百三十斤左右原粮的收益。据今年国家的购猪计划估计，全国养猪户将较提价前多得约一亿八千余万元的收益。
    各地在调整收购价格的同时，还改变了以销地销售价格核定产地收购价格的办法，缩小了地区差价。据十九个省、区部分边远山区统计，这些地区生猪的收购价格上升幅度较各该省内平均上升幅度超过70.77％，而且各种接壤地区的价格已经基本拉平。这将有力地促进边远地区生猪生产迅速发展。为了便利农民出售生猪，各地也简化了复杂的购猪规格和等级。广东、广西并规定给予持有留肉优待券的农民低于零售价格5％的优待。
    随着生猪收购价格的提高，目前小猪市场空前活跃，大部分地区供不应求，价格扶摇直上。河南南阳县的小猪原来每斤四角，3月份上升为八角、一元、以至一元二角。云南陆良县每斤小猪由八角上升至一元八角。这个问题如不及时解决，将会抵销一部分因提高肥猪价格而增加的收益。　　　　　（纪翰）
