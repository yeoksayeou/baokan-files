    The Latest Export Commodity
    Citronella Oil is Exported to Europe

    (Reported by this newspaper) Citronella oil produced in Hainan Island, China, has been exported to Europe. This is one of the newest commodities in China's foreign trade.

    Citronella oil is a raw material for manufacturing perfumes, soaps, and menthol. Before liberation, only Taiwan produced it. In recent years, due to the country's active investment in the development of Hainan, large areas have been planted with citronella grass, and more than 30 citronella processing plants have been established successively, so the production of citronella oil has gradually developed. In the first quarter of this year, the value of citronella oil exported from Hainan to European capitalist countries reached more than 200,000 US dollars.

    Patchouli oil, known as the "king of fragrances," has also begun to be refined and produced in Hainan Island this year and is planned for export. (Zeng Qiong)

    最新的出口商品
    香茅油远销欧洲
    本报讯　我国海南岛出产的香茅油已远销到欧洲。这是我国对外贸易上一种最新的商品。
    香茅油是制造香水、香皂和薄荷脑的原料。解放前只有台湾一地出产。最近几年，由于国家积极投资开发海南，大面积种植香茅草，并先后建立了三十多个香茅加工厂，香茅油的生产才逐渐发展起来。今年第一季度，由海南远销到欧洲资本主义国家的香茅油，价值达二十余万美元。
    被称为“香中之王”的藿香油，今年海南岛也开始提炼生产，并计划出口。　（曾琼）
