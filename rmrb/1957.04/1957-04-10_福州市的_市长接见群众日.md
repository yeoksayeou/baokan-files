Fuzhou's "Mayor's Reception Day for the Masses"
	Sun Dexian
	Starting in October of last year, the Fuzhou Municipal People's Committee established a "Mayor's Reception Day for the Masses" system, stipulating that the afternoons of the first and third weeks of each month would be the Mayor's time for receiving the masses. Over the past few months, they have received hundreds of people.
	One day, Chen Guolin, a resident of No. 27 Miao Lane, came to the reception room and told Vice Mayor Sun Tongwen about his dismissal from the factory. In 1955, the factory manager (shareholder representative), Huang Qihua, used the shareholder meeting's austerity measures as a pretext to dismiss Chen Guolin. For this matter, Chen Guolin had run to the Municipal Bureau of Industry countless times, looking for the director and section chiefs, requesting reinstatement. However, the Municipal Bureau of Industry did not conduct an in-depth investigation, only listening to Huang Qihua's side of the story and not seriously resolving the matter. Later, Chen Guolin wrote more than a dozen letters of appeal to the Municipal Bureau of Industry and other units, but to no avail. As a result, Chen Guolin was unemployed for more than a year. Based on his request, Vice Mayor Sun Tongwen instructed the General Office of the Municipal People's Committee to handle the matter in conjunction with the Municipal Bureau of Industry. After several in-depth investigations and studies at the factory, relevant departments believed that Chen Guolin had the labor capacity and had been involved in the production of the cable department for a long time, and that the factory's dismissal of Chen Guolin at that time was inappropriate. Last December, Chen Guolin was arranged to work at the Fuzhou Rubber Factory. He gratefully said: If the mayor hadn't received me, I might still be unemployed!
	A demobilized soldier wearing a black uniform reflected the overstaffing of the finance section of their factory to Vice Mayor Xie Baiqiu in the reception room, requesting personnel adjustments so that he could do more work. The demobilized soldier's name was Zheng Jiazhong. In September of last year, after studying at the Provincial Department of Industry's finance training class, he was assigned to the Fuzhou Fertilizer Factory's finance section as an accountant. However, the factory only had eight or nine accounts to deal with each day, and the three accountants in the section averaged less than four or five hours of work per day. Therefore, for several months, Zheng Jiazhong had been idle and feeling anxious. He reported this to the factory's Party branch secretary, who replied, "If you don't have anything to do, you can read books."
	"How can I live by reading books!" Zheng Jiazhong looked at Vice Mayor Xie with distress and said: I am a young man, in the great socialist construction, how can I just eat and do little work?
	After listening to his complaint, Vice Mayor Xie comforted him to continue working with peace of mind, and told him that relevant departments were dealing with the matter and would never allow anyone useful to the country to waste their youth. Now the Municipal Personnel Bureau and the Bureau of Industry have studied the organizational structure and personnel issues of the Fuzhou Fertilizer Factory; Zheng Jiazhong has been transferred to work in the countryside.
	When creative suggestions from the masses encounter obstacles, they are also willing to come to the reception room to ask responsible comrades for support. Not long ago, resident Yang Wenjie initially researched the use of Fujian's abundant tallow seed oil mixed with additives to replace tung oil. In principle, this gratifying suggestion should have received the support and welcome of relevant departments. But things were not like this. Last year, he ran to the handicraft department of the district committee to introduce how he used tallow seed oil to replace tung oil, but the cadres of the handicraft department of the district committee heard from somewhere that a factory in Fuzhou was already researching this issue, so they rejected his suggestion. Therefore, he asked the mayor for support. The comrades who received him attached great importance to his suggestion. While encouraging him, they introduced him to the Fuzhou Construction Engineering Company for contact. After the first engineering department of this company experimented according to Yang Wenjie's suggestion, it has initially achieved success. According to statistics, using tallow seed oil mixed with additives and a small amount of tung oil to replace tung oil can reduce costs by 45%. Now Fuzhou's relevant departments are planning to promote the use of this mixed oil in the city's manual painting industry and construction industry.
	In September of last year, the Fuzhou Min Opera Association signed a public medical insurance contract with the Fuzhou Municipal Second Hospital. Over the past few months, due to problems with the hospital's use of drugs and financial system, it resulted in overspending of several thousand yuan. The Second Hospital wrote a report requesting the Municipal Health Bureau to stop the free medical care for artists. The Municipal Health Bureau did not study it well, and stopped the free medical care for artists based on the hospital's opinion.
	Municipal People's Representative Zhu Liquan led four artists to the reception room and excitedly told Mayor Zhang Jizhong about this matter. Mayor Zhang Jizhong said: The Municipal Health Bureau's practice of notifying the termination of free medical care for artists without consultation and research with the Municipal Min Opera Association is wrong. Artists should still enjoy free medical care and should be restored quickly. As for the problems existing in the artists' public medical care, it must be studied and resolved well. The artists expressed satisfaction with the mayor's reply. Two days later, the Municipal Second Hospital restored the artists' free medical care. The artists said: After all, it is the people's own government, and it immediately corrects its shortcomings as soon as they are discovered.
	During the reception, most of the issues raised by the masses have been resolved. Some of the issues raised by visitors cannot be resolved quickly, and the reception room patiently persuades and explains to the visitors according to different situations. Visitors have expressed their gratitude and satisfaction for the mayor's kind reception and enthusiastic help. In order to further improve the work of receiving the masses, the People's Committees of Fuzhou's districts have also universally established the "District Mayor's Reception Day for the Masses" system, so as to more widely contact the masses, listen to their opinions, and solve the problems that can be solved for the masses.

### 福州市的“市长接见群众日”

    福州市的“市长接见群众日”
    孙德籼
    从去年10月份开始，福州市人民委员会建立“市长接见群众日”制度，规定每个月的第一个和第三个星期的下午为市长接见群众时间。几个月来，他们已经接见了几百个群众。
    一天，住在庙巷二十七号的居民陈国霖来到接待室，向孙同温副市长，诉说了他被厂方解雇的经过。1955年，这个厂经理（股东代表）黄其华，借股东会紧缩开支为名，解雇了陈国霖。为了这件事，陈国霖不知多少次跑到市工业局，找过局长，找过科长。要求复职。可是市工业局不做深入调查，只偏听了黄其华的话没有认真解决这件事。后来，陈国霖又先后向市工业局等单位写了十多封信申诉，仍无结果，陈国霖因此失业了一年多。孙同温副市长根据他的要求，指示市人民委员会办公厅会同市工业局进行处理。有关部门几次深入到厂调查研究后，认为陈国霖有劳动力，而且又长期参加电线部生产，当时厂方解雇陈国霖是不恰当的。去年12月陈国霖已被安排到福州橡胶厂工作。他感激地说：要不是市长接见我，我说不定现在还失业哩！
    一个穿着黑色制服的复员军人，在接待室向谢白秋副市长反映了他们厂里财务科人浮于事的情况，要求调整人事，让自己多做些工作。这个复员军人名叫郑家钟。去年9月间，他进省工业厅财务教练班学习后，被分配到福州肥料厂财务科当会计员。可是，厂里每天只有八、九笔帐目，科里三个会计平均一天还干不上四、五个小时工作。所以几个月来，郑家钟一直闲得心里发慌。他向厂里党支部书记反映过，支部书记回答他说：“没有事情干，可以看看书呀”。
    “看书过日子怎么能行呢！”郑家钟苦恼地望着谢副市长说：我是青年人，在轰轰烈烈的社会主义建设中，光吃饭，少干事，这怎么能成呢？
    谢副市长听了他的诉说后，一面安慰他继续安心工作，一面对他说，有关部门正在处理这件事，决不让每一个对祖国有用的人虚度青春。现在市人事局和工业局对福州肥料厂的机构和人事问题，已作了研究；郑家钟已被调到农村工作。
    群众提出了创造性的建议遇到阻碍后，也愿意来到接待室找负责同志要求支持，居民杨文捷不久前初步研究了利用福建盛产的桕子油混合掺合料代替桐油使用。这一可喜的建议，按理说，应该得到有关部门的支持和欢迎。可是事情并不是这样。去年他曾跑到区委手工业部，介绍了他怎样利用桕子油代替桐油使用的方法，但是区委手工业部的干部不知从那里听说福州已有一个厂在研究这个问题了，就拒绝了他的建议。因此他请求市长支持。接见他的同志，对他的建议极为重视。一面鼓励他，一面介绍他到福州市建筑工程公司联系。这个公司第一工程处按照杨文捷的建议作了实验后，已初步获得成功。据统计，利用桕子油混合掺合料和少量桐油代替桐油使用，可降低成本45％。现在福州市有关部门正计划在全市手工漆作行业、建筑业推广使用这种混合油料。
    去年9月间，福州市闽剧协会与福州市立第二医院订立了公费医疗合同。几个月来，由于医院使用药品和财务制度上有问题，结果多支出了几千元，第二医院写了个报告，要求市卫生局停止艺人公费医疗，市卫生局没有很好研究，就根据医院方面的意见把艺人的公费医疗停止了。
    市人民代表朱丽泉领着四个艺人来到接待室，激动地向张继中市长倾诉了这件事。张继中市长说：市卫生局未与市闽剧协会商量研究，就通知停止艺人公费医疗的做法是不对的。艺人仍应享受公费医疗，应该迅速恢复。至于艺人公费医疗中存在的问题，必须很好研究解决。艺人们对市长的答复表示满意。隔了二天，市立第二医院就恢复了艺人的公费医疗。艺人们说：到底是人民自己的政府，一发现缺点，就马上纠正。
    在接见中，群众所提出的问题，绝大部分已经处理完毕。来访者提出的问题，也有一部分是一时不能很快解决的，接待室都分别情况，向来访者进行耐心说服、解释。来访者对于市长亲切的接见和热情的帮助都表示感谢和满意。为了进一步做好接见群众工作，最近福州各区人民委员会也普遍建立了“区长接见群众日”制度，以便更广泛地联系群众，倾听群众意见，为群众解决能够解决的问题。
