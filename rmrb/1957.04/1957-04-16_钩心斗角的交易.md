A Scene in the House of Commons

On April 8th, such a scene was staged in the British House of Commons. Labor MP Shinwell asked Minister of State Ormsby-Gore, "As I understand it, is our country's policy on trade with China now dictated by the United States? Is this correct?"

Ormsby-Gore stammered in reply that consultation with the United States was necessary in order to "maintain a common front."

At this time, Conservative MP Viscount Hinchingbrooke directly asked: If the United States' reply is "unsatisfactory," will Britain take unilateral action? The Minister of State avoided answering this question.

On the same day, a spokesperson for the British Board of Trade reminded people that the order issued in 1950 prohibiting all exports to North Korea ceased to be effective on March 4th. According to the British Foreign Office, "This is merely an administrative adjustment." The same embargo restrictions as those imposed on China will be implemented against Democratic Korea. This decision was made public in a Board of Trade journal on February 25th. The Board of Trade spokesperson did not explain why it was necessary to remind everyone about it now.

However, an Associated Press dispatch from London is of reference value. It said, "It seems clear that Macmillan is confronting the President (Eisenhower) with the possibility that if the United States does not quickly agree to relax these restrictions, the entire embargo system may collapse."

Now is the Time

Since the end of the Bermuda Conference, relaxing the embargo restrictions on trade with China has become a major issue in Anglo-American relations. The British "Daily Express" typically expressed Britain's impatience on the issue of expanding trade with China. It said on April 9th, "Britain must fight for more exports… other countries are seizing this (Chinese) market. Britain must join in now, or fall behind." It said, "The British government is still waiting for the United States to allow the lifting of… the restrictions we impose on trade with China. … Whether they agree or not, now is the time, the British government should realize that British affairs are British affairs. Decisions should be made here. And it should be done quickly."

The US "Quid Pro Quo"

But the problem is not that simple. Now many things in Britain cannot but obey the orders of the United States. Although British officials have repeatedly expressed "hope" that the United States and other relevant governments "will soon" begin discussing the embargo issue on China, the United States has always been "all talk and no action." Eisenhower's remarks at a press conference on April 10 regarding the British and Japanese requests to relax the embargo were very interesting. He talked a lot about the "catch and release" tactics that must be used for Japan, hoping to "consider the Japanese issue slightly." But for the British request, he lightly glossed over it in only two sentences.

The reality is: the United States is admiring with schadenfreude how the British lion is struggling in the mire of economic difficulty. Strengthening Britain's economic position and increasing the strength of this powerful rival in the world market is not what American monopoly capital desires. According to news revealed from Washington, the United States is attempting to use strengthening trade restrictions on the Soviet Union and Eastern European People's Democracies as a "quid pro quo" for relaxing trade restrictions on China. In 1956, Anglo-Soviet trade increased, totaling 111.1 million pounds (equivalent to 310.8 million US dollars). No wonder some people describe this as a "deal full of intrigues," and British exporters have already said that this approach is unacceptable to Britain.

Convincing Arguments

Seeing Britain's demand to relax the embargo restrictions on China, American exporters also became interested. Two hundred industrialists from the New York Export Managers Club expressed a "strong sentiment demanding the removal of government restrictions on the transportation of non-strategic materials" at a conference. Many exporters said that they could not see "what good the complete ban on the shipment of American goods to Red China does to the American economy." The "New York Herald Tribune" even said, "The needs of America's allies and the fact that the embargo against Red China is fundamentally ineffective are convincing arguments for relaxing trade barriers."

However, despite the "convincing arguments," Eisenhower flatly said that the United States "will implement the embargo," "We do not deal with Communist China." For American exporters, they are of course helpless. But what about those who do not hold American passports? When will they have the courage to prevent themselves from becoming victims of the unfortunate policies of the US State Department? This is still a question.

    钩心斗角的交易
    李不雕
    下院里的一幕
    4月8日，英国下院里演出了这样一幕。工党议员辛威尔问国务大臣欧姆斯比—戈尔说，“据我理解，我国对华贸易的政策现在是听命于美国的，这一点对吗？”
    欧姆斯比—戈尔吞吞吐吐地回答说，为了“维持一条共同的战线”，同美国“会商”是需要的。
    这时候，保守党议员欣琴布鲁克子爵直截了当地问道：如果美国的答复“不能令人满意”的话，英国是否会采取单方面的行动。国务大臣对这个问题避而不答。
    就在同一天，英国贸易部的一位发言人提醒人们，1950年发布的禁止对北朝鲜一切出口的命令，在3月4日停止生效了。据英国外交部说，“这只不过是行政上的调整”。对民主朝鲜将实行像对中国一样的禁运限制。这个决定在2月25日的一期贸易部杂志上就公开了，为什么要在现在来重新提醒大家，贸易部的发言人没有说明。
    不过，美联社从伦敦发出的一条消息是有参考价值的。它说，“看来很明显，麦克米伦使总统（艾豪森威尔）正视这种可能性：如果美国不迅速同意放宽这种限制，整个禁运制度可能会垮台。”
    现在是时候了
    从百慕大会议结束以来，放宽对华贸易的禁运限制，已经成为英、美关系中的一个大问题。英国“每日快报”很典型地表达了英国在扩大对华贸易问题上的急不可耐的心情。它在4月9日说，“英国必须争取更多的出口……别的国家正在夺取（中国）这个市场。英国现在必须参加进去，否则就要落后了。”它说，“英国政府仍然在等候美国准许取消……我们同中国的贸易所实行的限制。……不论他们是否同意，现在是时候了，英国政府应该认识到英国的事情是英国的事情。应该由这边作出决定。而且要赶快。”
    美国的“交换条件”
    可是问题并不这么简单，现在英国的许多事情都不能不听美国的命令。尽管英国官员一再表示“希望”美国以及其他有关政府“现在很快就会”开始讨论对中国的禁运问题，美国却始终是“只听楼梯响，不见人下来”。艾森豪威尔4月10日在记者招待会上关于英国和日本要求放宽禁运的谈话是很有意思的。他谈了一大套对日本必须采用“欲擒故纵”的策略的话，希望“稍为考虑一下日本的问题”。但是对于英国的要求，却轻描淡写地只用两句话就一笔带过。
    实际情况是：美国正在以幸灾乐祸的心情，欣赏着英国这只狮子怎样在经济困难的泥坑中挣扎。加强英国经济地位、在世界市场上增强这个劲敌的力量，不是美国垄断资本所希望的事情。从华盛顿透露出来的消息说，美国企图以加强对苏联和东欧人民民主国家的贸易限制，作为放宽对华贸易限制的“交换条件”。1956年英、苏贸易有了增长，总额达到了一亿一千一百万英镑（合三亿一千零八十万美元）。无怪乎有人把这说成是一种“勾心斗角的交易”，而英国出口业人士已经说这种办法是英国所不能接受的。
    令人信服的论点
    眼看着英国要求放宽对华禁运限制，美国的出口商也动了心。纽约出口业经理俱乐部的二百个实业家，在一次会议上表现了一种“要求取消政府对运输非战略物资的限制的强烈情绪”。许多出口商表示，他们看不出，“完全禁止美货输往赤色中国的做法，对美国经济有什么好处”。“纽约先驱论坛报”甚至说，“美国的盟国的需要和对红色中国禁运根本不起任何作用的事实，是说明应当放宽贸易障碍的令人信服的论点。”
    可是，尽管有“令人信服的论点”，艾森豪威尔还是斩钉截铁地说，美国“就是要实行禁运”，“我们不跟共产党中国打交道”。对于美国出口商来说，他们当然无可奈何。可是那些不拿美国护照的人呢？什么时候他们才有勇气使自己不成为美国国务院的倒霉政策的牺牲品，这却还是一个问题。
