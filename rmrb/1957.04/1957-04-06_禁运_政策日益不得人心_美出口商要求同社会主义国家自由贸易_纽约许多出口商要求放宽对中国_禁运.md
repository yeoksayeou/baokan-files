Xinhua News Agency, 5th dispatch from New York: The American "Commercial Daily" reported on the 4th that at a recent meeting of the Export Managers Club of New York, many people called for the United States to engage in freer trade with socialist countries, and hoped to trade with China.

The "Commercial Daily" said: "A strong sentiment has developed among exporters demanding the abolition of government restrictions on the export of non-strategic materials." The newspaper said that the Export Managers Club of New York is an organization of managers of major American companies engaged in export business. A "large" proportion of the two hundred industrialists who attended the meeting said that they believed that lifting these restrictions "would help the United States economically."

Xinhua News Agency, 5th dispatch from San Francisco: The twelfth convention of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union on the West Coast of the United States unanimously passed a resolution on the 3rd, demanding that the United States trade with all countries, including China.

The union's president, Bridges, said: "This kind of resolution may cause our union to be accused of being a subversive organization. However, we put forward this resolution without meaning to strengthen Communist China. It seems that Communist China is doing very well without our help."

Xinhua News Agency, 5th dispatch from Kyodo News Agency, New York: Many exporters in New York are demanding that the United States relax its embargo on China.

The Export Managers Club, a powerful exporters' group, held its annual meeting from the 2nd to the 3rd. At the meeting, many people agreed with the views expressed by Ford Motor Company General Manager Ford regarding the relaxation of the embargo. Ford had said that imposing an embargo on China would hinder the development of the American economy.

Many exporters attending the annual meeting also pointed out that prohibiting the export to China of non-strategic materials currently exported to the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries is a deviation and meaningless.

    “禁运”政策日益不得人心
    美出口商要求同社会主义国家自由贸易
    纽约许多出口商要求放宽对中国“禁运”
    新华社5日讯　纽约消息：美国“商务日报”4日报道，最近在纽约出口业经理俱乐部的一次会议上，有许多人要求美国同社会主义国家进行较为自由的贸易，并且希望同中国进行贸易。
    “商务日报”说：“出口商中间已经发展了一种要求取消政府对输出非战略物资的限制的强烈情绪。”这家报纸说，纽约出口业经理俱乐部是美国大公司经营出口业务的经理们的组织。参加这次会议的二百个实业家中有“很大”一部分人表示，他们相信取消这些限制“将在经济上帮助美国。”
    新华社5日讯　旧金山消息：美国西海岸的国际码头与仓库工人工会的第十二次代表大会3日一致通过决议，要求美国同一切国家进行贸易，包括同中国进行贸易。
    这个工会的主席布里治说：“这类决议可能会使我们这个工会被控为一个破坏活动组织。但是，我们提出这个决议并没有意思要加强共产党中国。看来共产党中国不用我们的帮助也干得很万事顺利。”
    新华社5日讯　据共同社纽约消息：纽约的许多出口业者要求美国放宽对中国实行的禁运。
    有势力的出口业者团体——出口业经理俱乐部曾经在2日到3日举行年会。会上，很多人表示同意福特公司总经理福特所表示过的关于放宽禁运的意见。福特曾经说，对中国实行禁运，将会阻碍美国经济的发展。
    出席这次年会的许多出口业者还指出，禁止向中国输出目前已经向苏联和东欧各国输出的非战略物资，是一种偏差，也是毫无意义的。
