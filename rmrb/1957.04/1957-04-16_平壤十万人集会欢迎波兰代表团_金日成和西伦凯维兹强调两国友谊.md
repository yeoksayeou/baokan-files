    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 15th: A grand rally of over 100,000 people in Pyongyang was held at Kim Il-sung Square yesterday at 1:00 PM to welcome the Polish government delegation headed by Cyrankiewicz.

    Giant Chinese and Polish national flags hung from the tall buildings on both sides of Kim Il-sung Square. Chairman Cyrankiewicz, accompanied by Premier Kim Il-sung, ascended the rostrum, at which point enthusiastic applause and cheers erupted from the crowd.

    Premier Kim Il-sung first spoke at the rally. He extended a warm welcome to the delegation on behalf of the Korean people. He recounted the various forms of assistance that the Polish people had given to Korea during and after the war. He said that the Polish people actively supported the Korean people's struggle for a peaceful resolution to the Korean issue, and in particular, Poland's participation in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission played a significant role in maintaining peace in Korea and easing tensions in the Far East.

    Kim Il-sung said that the strengthening and unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is a strong guarantee for the Korean people's struggle for independence and unification. The Korean people cherish their friendship with the Polish people as much as they cherish their friendship with the people of other fraternal countries, and will make every effort to further strengthen and develop this friendship.

    Cyrankiewicz then spoke, expressing his gratitude for the warm reception the delegation received from the Korean people.

    He said that in order to contribute to the consolidation of peace in Korea and the political resolution of the Korean issue, the Polish government participated in the work of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission overseeing the Korean armistice. As long as the actual situation in Korea requires it, we will continue to work in this commission.

    He said that the most solid foundation of the friendship between the Korean and Polish people is the love of freedom, the common ideology – the ideology of Marxism-Leninism, and the common interests of the countries. The friendship between the Korean and Polish people and the political, economic, and cultural cooperation between the two countries are beneficial to strengthening the unity of socialist countries.

    平壤十万人集会欢迎波兰代表团
    金日成和西伦凯维兹强调两国友谊
    据新华社平壤15日电　平壤市十万多群众昨天下午一时在金日成广场举行盛大集会，欢迎以西伦凯维兹为首的波兰政府代表团。
    金日成广场两旁的高楼上悬挂着巨幅的朝波两国国旗。西伦凯维兹主席在金日成首相陪同下登上主席台，这时人群中发出热烈的掌声和欢呼声。
    金日成首相首先在大会上讲话。他代表朝鲜人民向代表团表示热烈欢迎。他叙述了波兰人民在战时和战后给予朝鲜的各种援助。他说，波兰人民积极支持朝鲜人民和平解决朝鲜问题的斗争，特别是波兰参加了中立国监察委员会，对维护朝鲜的和平和缓和远东的紧张局势起了不小的作用。
    金日成说，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的加强和团结是朝鲜人民争取独立和统一的坚强的保证。朝鲜人民像珍视同其他兄弟国家人民的友谊一样，珍视同波兰人民的友谊，并且为进一步加强和发展这种友谊而作一切的努力。
    西伦凯维兹接着讲话。他对朝鲜人民对代表团的热情接待表示感谢。
    他说，波兰政府为了对巩固朝鲜的和平和朝鲜问题的政治解决作出贡献，参加了监督朝鲜停战的中立国监察委员会的工作。只要朝鲜的实际情况需要它，我们将继续在这个委员会中工作。
    他说，朝波两国人民间的友谊的最坚固的基础是对自由的热爱、共同的思想——马克思列宁主义思想、国家的共同的利害关系。朝波两国人民的友谊和两国间的政治经济文化合作有益于加强社会主义国家的团结。
