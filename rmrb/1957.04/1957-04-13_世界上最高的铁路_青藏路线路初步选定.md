World's Highest Railway
    Preliminary Route Selected for the Qinghai-Tibet Line

    (Xinhua News Agency) The basic route of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway has been initially determined, and aerial surveying is being accelerated.

    This railway will start from Golmud in Qinghai and end in Lhasa, Tibet, with a total length of more than 1,300 kilometers. The characteristics of this railway are complex terrain and geology, many watersheds and rivers, and an altitude of over 4,000 meters above sea level. However, due to the use of the latest Soviet surveying tools in the survey—radio altimeters, differential altimeters, automatic recorders, and aerial cameras—after the aerial photography work is completed, there is no need to do ground control measurements, and small-scale topographic maps can be directly compiled.

    The railway to be built in the future will cross the Kunlun Mountains at an altitude of more than 4,800 meters and the Tanggula Pass at an altitude of more than 5,000 meters, making it the highest railway in the world. (Attached picture)

    世界上最高的铁路
    青藏路线路初步选定
    据新华社讯　青藏铁路的基本线路已经初步确定，目前还在加速进行航测。
    这条铁路将起于青海的噶尔穆，止于西藏的拉萨，全长一千三百多公里。这条铁路的特点是地形地质复杂，分水岭和河流多，拔海高度在四千公尺以上。但是由于在勘查中采用了苏联最新的勘查工具——无线电测高仪、高差仪、自动纪录仪、航摄仪，在空中摄影工作完成后，不需再做地面控制测量，就可以直接编制小比例尺的地形图。
    将来修建的这条铁路，要跨越拔海四千八百多公尺的昆仑山和拔海五千多公尺的唐古拉山口，将是世界上最高的一条铁路。（附图片）
