Xinhua News Agency reporter Shā Yīn reports: By the late night of March 31st, steelworkers at the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant had overfulfilled their first quarter steel production task by 2,887 tons.

    In the first three months of this year, there was a severe shortage of scrap steel. To cope with this, steelworkers had to devise every possible method to reduce the amount of scrap steel used per ton of steel from 30% last year to 10% to 15%. This resulted in more pig iron and more slag, which prolonged smelting time. However, steelworkers vigorously strengthened furnace maintenance and promoted rapid steelmaking, overcoming these difficulties. The average smelting time per furnace in March was shortened by eighteen minutes compared to February.

    太原炼钢工人的成就
    新华社记者莎荫报道：到3月31日深夜为止，太原钢铁厂炼钢工人超额二千八百八十七吨完成了第一季度的炼钢任务。
    今年的头三个月，废钢非常缺乏，炼钢工人们不得不想尽一切办法把每吨钢所用的废钢由去年的30％减少到10％至15％。这样，生铁多、渣质多，就要延长冶炼时间。但是炼钢工人大力加强炉体维护和推行快速炼钢，战胜了困难。三月份平均每一炉的冶炼时间，已比二月份缩短了十八分钟。
