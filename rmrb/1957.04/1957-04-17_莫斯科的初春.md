Moscow's Early Spring

　　In the thawing April weather, after the last few rounds of wind and snow, spring, which is always late in arriving, has come to Moscow. The snow in the streets and suburbs has melted, and in the parks and gardens, the birches are the first to sprout tender buds, and the snowball flowers are the first to bloom. Moscow's most charming and enchanting season of the year has begun.

　　Take a walk in the streets, and you will see more children in the street gardens than in any other season. The children's faces are filled with the joy of spring. During the long winter, the children wore thick leather coats and could only waddle like penguins. And the warmth of April frees them first. On the trams, people suddenly feel relaxed, and they no longer miss their stops because of the ice flowers on the glass windows and the hazy snowflakes outside. The colors on the streets have become richer. Although it is not yet the time for spring outings, the ladies have already put on their spring clothes. The potted flowers in every household stretch their green branches in front of the open windows, attracting passers-by.

　　Once the vernal equinox passes, the days in Moscow become longer. Four o'clock in the morning is already the time of spring dawn, the weather is clear, with white clouds and blue sky. Go to the suburbs, and you will see tractors everywhere turning over the moist soil. Spring plowing campsites are marked by fluttering red flags. Go to the Agricultural Exhibition, where heavy renovation work is underway. People want to decorate it more beautifully, to make the golden peasant girl statues on the collective farm square more bright and magnificent, and to make the stone flower on the People's Friendship Square more dazzling and colorful.

　　This year, Moscow is a city of youth and friendship gathering. The World Youth Festival will be held here. The people of Moscow have put in much more energy and care than in previous years to dress up the city when the earth revives, so that young people from all over the world can appreciate the attractive features of this socialist capital. Now the artists of Moscow are probably the busiest people. In order to receive international friends of peace, hundreds and thousands of young people here are learning Chinese, Hindi, Indonesian… languages that are very unfamiliar and difficult for them. Now, what is most often heard in Moscow is the new song of the festival, full of friendship and ideals.

　　The twilight of Moscow's early spring is like a poetic and picturesque scene. The street lights have not yet come on, but the red stars of the Kremlin are already twinkling. A light breeze is blowing gently, and a thin mist is rising over the Moscow River. The working people are spending the spring of the fortieth year after the October Revolution in this beautiful city, building another thriving spring of communism.

### 莫斯科的初春

    莫斯科的初春
    在解冻的四月天，经过了最后的几场风、雪，一向姗姗来迟的春色来到了莫斯科。街头和郊区的积雪已经消溶，在公园和花园里，白桦最先吐出嫩芽，雪球花首先开放。莫斯科一年中最妩媚迷人的时季开始了。
    到街头去走走，你会看到街心花园里的儿童比任何季节都多。儿童们的脸上充满着春天的喜悦。在漫长的冬季里，孩子们穿着厚皮衣，只能像企鹅一样地摇摆着走路。而四月的温暖最先把他们解放出来。在电车里，人们突然觉得松动起来，再不会因为玻璃车窗上的冰花和窗外迷茫的飞雪而错过站头了。街上的色调已经丰富起来了。虽然还不是游春的时候，但是仕女们已经披上春装。家家户户的盆花在敞开的窗前舒展绿枝，吸引着过路的人。
    春分一过，莫斯科的白天就变长起来。早上四点钟已是春晓的时刻，天气晴朗，白云蓝天。到郊区去，你会看到到处有拖拉机在翻开润湿的土地。春耕的野营地上伸出了一幅幅飘动的红旗。到农业展览会去，那里在进行着繁重的修饰工作。人们要把那里装饰得更加漂亮，让集体农庄广场上的金色农女群像更加明媚灿丽，让人民友谊广场上的宝石花更加绚烂多采。
    今年的莫斯科是青春和友谊联欢的城市。世界青年联欢节将在这里举行。莫斯科人在大地回春的时候，投入了比往年更多得多的精力和关怀，来打扮这座城市，以便让来自世界各地的青年们欣赏这个社会主义首都的引人的风貌。现在莫斯科的艺术家们恐怕是最忙碌的人了。为了接待国际和平友人，这里有成百成千的青年在学习对他们说来是很生疏艰难的汉语、印地语、印度尼西亚语……现在，莫斯科最常常听到的是充满友谊和理想的联欢节的新歌曲。
    莫斯科初春的黄昏好像是诗情画境。街灯还没有亮，但克里姆林的红星已经在闪烁。微风在轻轻吹拂，莫斯科河上空起了一层薄雾。劳动人民在这个美丽的城市里，在度着十月革命后第四十个年度的春天，建设共产主义的又一个欣欣向荣的春天。
