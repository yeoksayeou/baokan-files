    Re-arranged the Work of Translators
    (1)
    After reading the article "Pay Attention to Translation Work" published in the People's Daily on January 11th, we immediately held a symposium for translators to fully understand the problems existing in translation work and asked the translators to put forward some suggestions for improvement in future translation work. We made some adjustments to salary and improper use, but some problems have not been resolved in a timely manner, such as rush work and the inability to fix specialties. In the past, due to the large amount of translation work, the strong time constraints, and the imbalance of various specialties, it was not easy to fix specialties. Now we have studied the training and specialization of translators and are gradually finding ways to solve them. Some issues have been inspected by the Second Ministry of Machine Building, and a ministry meeting was held on January 23 to specifically discuss translation issues and make some resolutions for improvement.

    The situation reflected in the reader's letter "We Demand Work" published on page 7 of the People's Daily on January 11th is true.

    Our bureau had a translation group in 1952, with about forty translators (including the group leader). For several years, the personnel allocation and translation work tasks have been basically balanced. At the end of 1955, our bureau not only increased a lot of design projects, but also had to invite a large number of foreign experts, so we did not consider transferring out translators. Later, due to the reduction of design projects, idle work began at the end of the second quarter of 1956. In order to overcome the phenomenon of idle work and solve the problem of wasted manpower, we took the following measures in the fourth quarter of 1956: on the one hand, we requested the higher authorities to transfer out nearly half of the translators, and on the other hand, we arranged for them to translate some foreign language materials necessary for design. At the same time, we organized them to study in a planned way during their free time and asked them to help technical personnel improve their Russian proficiency. Recently, a group of comrades has been sent on business trips (about four to six months).

    On January 11th, your newspaper published a reader's letter "We Demand Work," which reflects some facts. Our factory was built with the help of the Soviet Union, and most of the factory's design drawings and product drawings are provided by foreign countries and need to be translated. After March 1955, there were more than seventy people engaged in written translation. There are civil engineering translation groups and mechanical groups. There was a period when translation work was quite tight. In October of last year, because most of the infrastructure drawings had been translated, the civil engineering translation group was cancelled; recently, because the mechanical translation tasks are not large, the number of personnel has also been reduced by nearly half, and we have re-assigned these translators to other jobs. The situation was caused by our subjective responsibility, for example: the estimation of the number of drawings was not accurate, and there were too many translators. Because we did not anticipate this situation beforehand, our work arrangements for them were not thorough enough. However, there were indeed some objective difficulties. Because the drawings were provided by foreign countries, it was difficult to obtain an accurate number. At the same time, we concentrated on translating them as soon as possible in a short period of time. When the translation was completed, there was nothing else to translate. Therefore, translators could only be transferred or reassigned. Before re-arranging the work of the translators, we contacted the主管局 and other units in Wuhan Municipality many times, but they were unable to assign them translation work. Therefore, we took the following measures: those who are suitable for technical work are assigned to the technical departments to be trained as technical personnel, or as professional personnel (planners); a small number of people are assigned to general administrative work with their consent. At the same time, wages are not reduced due to job changes.

### 重新安排了翻译人员的工作

专栏：对本报批评的反应

    重新安排了翻译人员的工作
    （一）
    我们看到人民日报1月11日刊载的“重视翻译工作”一文后，当即召开翻译同志座谈会，对于翻译工作中所存在的问题进行了全面了解，并且请翻译同志对今后有关翻译工作方面提出一些改进意见。我们对于工资待遇、使用不当等进行了部分调整，但也有些问题还未得到及时解决，如赶工突击、专业不好固定等。由于过去翻译工作量较大、时间性较强和各专业又不平衡，因此专业不易固定。现在我们对翻译的培养和专业问题均进行了研究，并逐步设法解决。有些问题已经由第二机械工业部进行了检查，并在1月23日召开了部务会议，专门讨论翻译问题，并作出一些改进的决议。

    1月11日人民日报第七版发表的读者来信——“我们要求有工作”，其中所反映的情况属实。
    我局在1952年就有译翻组，翻译人员（包括组长）约四十人。几年来人员配备和翻译工作任务基本上是平衡的。1955年末，我局不仅增加了很多设计项目，而且要请大批外国专家，所以没有考虑调出翻译人员。后来由于设计项目的减少，因此在1956年第二季度末开始窝工。为了克服窝工现象，为了解决人力浪费问题，我们在1956年第四季度采取了如下措施：一方面请求上级调出将近一半的翻译人员，另一方面安排他们翻译一些设计上必需的外文资料。同时组织他们利用空时间有计划的进行学习，并请他们帮助技术人员提高俄文水平。最近派一部分同志出差工作（约四至六个月）。

    1月11日，你报发表了“我们要求有工作”的读者来信，其中所反映的事实是有的。我厂是苏联帮助建设的，工厂的设计图纸和产品图纸大部分是国外供给的，需要翻译。1955年3月以后，搞笔译的有七十余人。设土建翻译组和机械组。有一个时期翻译工作还相当紧张。去年10月间，因基建图纸绝大部分已经翻译完，所以把土建翻译组撤销；最近因机械方面翻译任务不大，人员也减少将近一半，我们对这些翻译人员都另行分配工作。造成这种情况，在我们主观上是有一定责任的，例如：对图纸数量估计不准确，翻译人员多了一些。由于事前对这种情况估计不足，因此，对他们的工作安排考虑得不够周到。但是在客观上也确是有一些困难的，由于图纸是国外供给的，很难得到一个正确数字，同时集中在短时期内尽快翻译，翻译完了就没有别的可翻译，因此，翻译人员只有调动或转业。我们在另行安排翻译人员工作之前，先同主管局和武汉市其他单位多次联系，它们也无法分配他们搞翻译工作，因此，我们采取如下办法：适合搞技术工作的，分配到技术科室作为技术人员培养，或作为专业人员（计划员）培养；少数一部分人，经征得本人同意分配担任一般行政工作。同时不因调动工作而降低工资。　　武汉重型机床厂
