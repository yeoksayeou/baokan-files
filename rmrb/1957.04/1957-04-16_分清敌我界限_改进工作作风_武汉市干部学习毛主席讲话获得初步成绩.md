    Distinguish Between Ourselves and the Enemy; Improve Working Style:
    Wuhan Cadres Achieve Preliminary Success in Studying Chairman Mao's Speeches
    (Our newspaper Wuhan dispatch) Chairman Mao's speech on February 27 at the Supreme State Conference on "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and the spirit of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's Propaganda Work Conference are being widely disseminated and studied among cadres in Wuhan, in order to improve their ways of thinking, working methods, and work style.
    In this initial study, many leading cadres believe that although they had dealt with some contradictions among the people in the past, their understanding was not clear. After this study, their minds are much clearer. Some have also examined that in the past, in handling contradictions among the people, they sometimes overemphasized the "extremism" and "excessive demands" of the masses, neglecting to adopt the correct opinions of the masses to improve leadership, overcome bureaucracy, and then distinguish right from wrong among the masses and establish correct thinking. The Wuchang Vehicle Factory examined that in the past, it was unclear about the boundary between people's internal problems and enemy problems. Many technical cadres and intellectual cadres also generally reflected that Chairman Mao's speech was "approachable" and "persuasive."
    In this initial study, some ideological problems among cadres were also exposed. Some cadres believe that "the situation is much more complicated than in the past, and it is difficult to be a cadre," and some believe that "there is too much democracy among the masses now, and things are difficult to handle," and they miss some simple working methods of the past. The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party analyzed this situation, believing that on the one hand, it was because the cadres did not fully understand the importance of correctly handling contradictions among the people, and on the other hand, there was still resistance. How to unite the masses in work, especially uniting the backward masses, caring for and educating them kindly, is still a problem.

    分清敌我界限　改进工作作风
    武汉市干部学习毛主席讲话获得初步成绩
    本报武汉电　毛主席2月27日在最高国务会议上就“正确地处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲话和中共中央宣传工作会议的精神，正在武汉市干部中普遍传达和学习，以改进思想方法，改进工作方法和工作作风。
    在这次初步学习中，许多领导干部都认为过去虽然也处理过一些人民内部矛盾问题，但认识不明确。经过这次学习后，头脑清醒多了。有的还检查到过去在处理人民内部矛盾问题上，有时过分强调群众
  “极端主义”、“要求过高”，忽视了采纳群众的正确意见以改进领导，克服官僚主义，然后再在群众中分清是非，树立正确思想。武昌车辆厂检查到过去对人民内部问题和敌我问题的界限分不清楚。许多技术干部和知识分子干部也普遍反映毛主席的讲话“平易近人”，“以理服人”。
    在这次初步学习中，也暴露出干部中还有一些思想问题。有的干部认为“情况比过去复杂多了，干部难当了”，也有的认为“现在群众民主太多，事情难办”，留恋过去的某些简单的工作方法。中共武汉市委分析了这个情况，认为这一方面是由于干部没有充分领会正确地处理人民内部矛盾的问题的重要性，另一方面还存有抵触思想。如何在工作中团结群众，特别是团结落后群众，亲切关怀和教育他们，还是个问题。
