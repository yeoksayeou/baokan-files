    Ambassador Price Hike
    Recently, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower has been replacing U.S. ambassadors on a large scale. According to a United Press report, approximately thirty new ambassadors have been appointed or will be appointed. Many important positions, such as ambassadors to London, Paris, Madrid, Rome, Bonn, Mexico City, and New Delhi, will be filled by so-called "non-career diplomats." "New York Times" reporter Reston pointed out in a report that this is the largest change in American diplomatic representation since the President's re-election. This situation has caused an unusual uproar in the American bourgeois press.
    Many American newspapers revealed that these ambassadorial appointments are "a kind of political reward," especially those so-called "non-career diplomats" holding important positions, who have provided President Eisenhower with a considerable amount of campaign funds. "St. Louis Post-Dispatch" reporter Brandt said bluntly in a commentary that these positions were actually being "sold."
    It is certainly not a glorious thing for the U.S. President to be engaged in the business of selling official positions and titles. However, the American bourgeois press is not uneasy about this. Because, in the American so-called two-party system, such selling of official positions and titles has long been commonplace. It can be said that no U.S. president has ever not done this; even Eisenhower did not do this for the first time. After he was first elected president in 1952, he had already "sold" many ambassadorial positions. For example, former U.S. Ambassador to the UK Aldrich, former U.S. Ambassador to France Dillon, and former U.S. Ambassador to Italy Clare Boothe Luce all obtained prominent positions because they provided Eisenhower with campaign funds in 1952.
    So, why is the American bourgeois press making this unusual uproar? It seems that this is because they feel that this time it has been "sold" too indiscriminately. "St. Louis Post-Dispatch" reporter Brandt wrote with great lamentation: "Now the U.S. Ambassador to Paris will be a businessman who cannot speak French, the new ambassador to Germany (West Germany) will be a businessman who cannot speak German, and the new ambassador to Italy will be the owner of a paper mill, who says he only knows enough Italian to order food." Obviously, this means that the positions being "sold" have not been sold to the right people. But, since this is a business transaction, then whoever pays the money should call the tune; Brandt's lamentation shows that he does not understand this commercial law.
    However, "New York Times" reporter Reston seems to be well-versed in this. When talking about the above situation, he pointed out that this is because "Eisenhower has adopted the law of inflation in political rewards." He also explained that donors' money can no longer buy the same diplomatic tenure as in the past; after serving one term, new donors are waiting to replace them. In plain language, there are more people who want to buy ambassadorial positions with money. Therefore, the U.S. President took the opportunity to accelerate the turnover and increase the price of these positions.
    Although, in recent years, due to inflation, various prices in the United States have been constantly rising, it must be said that it is a new contribution of the U.S. President to "prospering" the American officialdom by also adopting this "law" in the business of selling official positions and titles.

### 大使涨价

    大使涨价
    最近期间，美国总统艾森豪威尔在大批地更换美国的驻外使节。据合众社的报道，已被任命或将被任命的约有三十位新大使。其中许多重要的职位，像驻伦敦、巴黎、马德里、罗马、波恩、墨西哥城和新德里的大使都要由所谓“非职业外交家”来充任。“纽约时报”记者赖斯顿在一篇报道中指出，这是一个总统重新当选后对美国外交代表的最大规模的一次更动。这种情况，在美国资产阶级的报刊上引起了一阵并非寻常的喧嚷。
    许多美国报刊揭露说，这些大使的任命是“一种政治报酬”，特别是那些担任重要职务的所谓“非职业外交家”，都是曾给艾森豪威尔提供了一笔相当可观的竞选经费的人。“圣路易邮报”记者勃兰德在一篇评论中就直截了当地说，这些职位实际上是被
  “卖掉”的。
    美国总统在干鬻官卖爵的勾当，这当然不是什么光采的事情。但是，美国资产阶级报刊却并不是因此而感到不安。因为，在美国的所谓两党制度中，这种鬻官卖爵的勾当早已是司空见惯的了。可以说，美国没有任何一任总统不曾这样干过；就是艾森豪威尔也并不是第一次这样干的。他在1952年第一次当选总统后，就曾“卖掉”过许多大使的职位。譬如，美国前任驻英大使阿尔德立奇、前任驻法大使狄龙、前任驻意大使卢斯夫人，就都是由于在1952年为艾森豪威尔提供了竞选经费，而得了显要的职位。
    那末，美国资产阶级报刊究竟为什么发出这一阵并非寻常的喧嚷呢？看来，这是由于他们感到这一次“卖”得太滥了。“圣路易邮报”的记者勃兰德就不胜慨叹地写道：“现在美国驻巴黎大使将由一个不会讲法国话的商人来担任，驻德国（西德）新大使将是一个不会说德国话的商人，驻意大利的新大使将是一个造纸工厂的厂主，他说他本人所会的意大利话只够点菜用。”显然，这是说被“卖掉”的职位没有卖给合适的人。但是，既然这是一种买卖勾当，那末，谁出了钱就应该由谁点曲子；勃兰德因此而发出慨叹，说明他还不懂得这种商业的法则。
    倒是“纽约时报”的记者赖斯顿似乎是精通此道的。他在谈到上述的情况时指出，这是由于
  “艾森豪威尔已在政治报酬上面采用了通货膨胀的法则”。他并且解释说，捐款人的钱已经买不到过去那样的外交职务的任期了；他们在担任了一任之后，就有新的捐款者在等待着接替他们了。换句明白易懂的话说，就是花钱要买大使职位的人多了。所以，美国总统就趁机把这种职位的周转加速、价格提高了。
    虽然，近几年来，由于通货膨胀，美国的各种物价都在不断上涨，但是，在鬻官卖爵的勾当上也采用这种“法则”，这不能不说是美国总统“繁荣”美国官场的一种新贡献。        （佳）（附图片）
