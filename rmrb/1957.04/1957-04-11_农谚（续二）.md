III. On Sowing

Sowing should adopt positive measures: “Seize the time to sow and reap.” “If you sow, you will reap.” “Plant melons and get melons, plant beans and get beans.” “One seed into the soil, ten thousand grains return to the granary.” “Seeing the seedlings is three-tenths of the harvest.” “Get up early and don't panic, sow early and don't be busy.” “Sow early in spring, harvest early in autumn.” “Young seedlings must not be destroyed, late seedlings must not be relied upon” (referring to spring seedlings, even if there are some missing seedlings, do not easily destroy them and re-sow). "One destruction means three failures."

Sowing time: “Around Grain Rain, plant melons and sow beans.” “Barley and peas should be planted before the ninth day of the second month.” “On the third day of the third month, gourds and squashes are carried home” (referring to the time to plant gourds and squashes). “At the Spring Equinox, wheat enters the soil” (referring to the time to plant barley). “When willow catkins are abundant, transplant rice seedlings.” “When jujube buds sprout, plant cotton.” “Grain Rain is early, Small Full is late, the Beginning of Summer is the right time for cotton.” “Small Full flowers, don’t go home.” “Small Full sorghum, awned grain millet.” “Small Full sesame, awned grain broomcorn millet.” “Small Full sesame, awned grain millet, plant glutinous millet after the Summer Solstice.” “For saline-alkali land, Grain Rain is not considered early, for yellow land, the Summer Solstice is not considered late” (referring to the time to plant sorghum and millet). “After the awned grain, you cannot force planting” (referring to the fact that you cannot force planting crops after the awned grain). “Ten days after the Summer Solstice is late seedlings.” “Do not plant sweet potatoes during the hot season; planting sweet potatoes will not yield sweet potatoes.”

“Do not plant beans after entering the hot season; planting beans will yield only a handful (meaning a small harvest).” “If you plant by hand after entering the hot season, you can harvest five pecks per stone” (meaning that if the seedlings are small due to late planting after entering the hot season, but if the weather is favorable and the management is proper, a good harvest can still be achieved). “After the Beginning of Autumn, even if you only poke a hole in the ground, you can still harvest a handful of grain.” “First hot season turnips, second hot season vegetables, if it rains in the third hot season, sow more wheat.” “First hot season buckwheat is a single stalk, second hot season buckwheat is a cluster of ears, third hot season buckwheat fills the granary.” “White Dew early, Cold Dew late, Autumn Equinox is the right time to sow wheat.” “Wheat should not be planted after the ninth lunar month, especially fearing snow in the first and second lunar months” (referring to the fact that wheat should not be planted too early). “Even if White Dew is early for sowing wheat, it is just right for the Hetao region.” “Sow in the ditches during White Dew, sow in the stubble fields during the Autumn Equinox” (referring to the time to sow wheat in ditches and stubble fields). “Wheat and beans are inseparable” (referring to the fact that the sowing and harvesting periods of wheat and beans are interconnected). “When wheat is yellow, plant beans in the wheat ridges; when beans are yellow, plant wheat in the bean ridges.” “If you plant millet and wheat late, don’t blame anyone if you don’t harvest.” “Late millet and wheat, don’t blame anyone if you don’t harvest.” “It is better to plant ‘dead wheat’ than ‘White Dew head’” (“dead wheat” refers to late wheat that does not sprout in the year of planting; “White Dew head” refers to late wheat that only shows sprouts in the year of planting; because the roots of the latter are shallow and easily die from drought, it is better to plant "dead wheat").

Sowing methods: “Deep plowing and shallow planting.”
“Plow deep when sowing in spring, plow shallow when sowing in summer” (referring to deep sowing in spring and shallow sowing in summer). “One finger for sorghum, half a finger for millet” (referring to the seed drill, when planting sorghum, the seed hole should be one finger wide, when planting millet, it should be half a finger wide). “Spend money to buy seeds, not to buy seedlings” (referring to the fact that the amount of seeds used for sowing should not be too small). “When planting, use more seeds, don’t be afraid of wind, rain, or insects.” “If you plant beans after entering the hot season, add a handful of seeds” (referring to the need to use more seeds when planting beans after entering the hot season).

Suitable soil and climate conditions for sowing:
“A timely snow promises a good harvest.” “Spring rain is as precious as oil.” “Rain on Pure Brightness promises a good year.” “After Grain Rain, there is no ground frost (no ground frost is suitable for seedling growth).”
“Sorghum and millet like moist yellow soil.”
“When sowing wheat, step in the mud.” “If it rains during the first hot season, it will be sunny during the second hot season, and if it rains during the third hot season, sow more wheat.” “Don’t be afraid of light rain, just be afraid of flooding” (referring to the fact that wheat is not afraid of heavy rain during sowing, but is afraid of heavy rain after sowing when the wheat grains swell and germinate).

Importance of selecting seeds and crop rotation: “Good seeds grow good seedlings, good gourds bear good dippers.” “If you choose well and dry thoroughly, you will get a good harvest without disease next year.” “A big mother brings fat children.” “Crop rotation is like applying manure.” “Sesame and melons are afraid of continuous cropping.” “Continuous cropping of millet, people suffer.” “Whether you are lucky or not, plant millet after beans” (referring to the fact that bean stubble is suitable for planting millet).

Law of crop emergence: “Seven days for millet, eight days for wheat” (referring to the time it takes for millet and wheat to emerge from sowing). “Five or six days for millet, seven or eight days for wheat.”

    三、关于播种的
    播种要采取积极的措施：“抢种抢收”。“得种得收”。“种瓜得瓜，种豆得豆”。“一粒入土，万粒归仓”。“见苗三分收”。“起早不慌，种早不忙”。“春天早种，秋天早收”。“青苗不可毁，晚苗不可赖”（指春苗虽缺些苗也不可轻易毁掉重种）。“一毁三不成”。
    播种的时间：“谷雨前后，点瓜种豆”。“大麦豌豆不出九”。“三月三，葫芦、倭瓜往家担”（指种葫芦、倭瓜的时间）。“春分麦入土”（指种大麦的时间）。“柳毛穰穰，下稻秧”。“枣芽发，种棉花”。“谷雨早，小满迟，立夏棉花正当时”。“小满花，不回家”。“小满高粱芒种谷”。“小满芝麻芒种黍”。“小满芝麻芒种谷，过了夏至种大黍”。“盐碱地谷雨不算早，黄土地夏至不算迟”（指种高粱、谷的时间）。“过了芒种，不可强种”（指植庄稼过了芒种就不能勉强种植了）。“夏至十天为晚苗”。“暑伏不种薯，种薯不结薯”。
    “入伏不种豆，种豆打一掬（指收获少的意思）”。“入伏拿手捣，打石五”（指因晚种入伏禾苗还小，但如风雨调和，经营得当，亦可丰收的意思）。“立秋一捣儿，还打把谷儿”。“头伏萝卜二伏菜，三伏有雨多耩麦”。“头伏棱子（即荞麦）一棵棍，二伏棱子一兜穗，三伏棱子打满囤”。“白露早，寒露迟，秋分种麦正当时”。“麦子不过九月节，单怕正月二月雪”（指种麦不可过早）。“别看白露耩麦早，要是河套就正好”。“白露耩道沟，秋分耩茬把”（指道沟和秋茬地种麦的时间）“麦不离豆，豆不离麦”（指麦、豆的播种期和收获期是互相衔接的）。“麦黄耠豆，豆黄耠麦”（指麦黄时可在麦垅种豆，豆黄时可在豆垅种麦）。“植黍晚麦，不收莫怪”。“迟黍晚麦，不收莫怪”。“能种蹩死牛，不种白露头”（蹩死牛指秋后播种当年不出苗的晚麦，白露头指秋后播种当年仅能露苗的晚麦，因后一种晚麦根扎的浅，遇旱容易干死，反不如蹩死牛）。
    播种的方法：“深耕浅种”。
    “春耩犁，夏耩皮”（指春天播种要深，夏天播种要浅）。“一指高粱半指谷”（指耧的子眼，在种高粱时应留一指宽，种谷时应留半指宽）。“有钱买种，没钱买苗”（指播种时下的籽种不可过少）。“种地多花种，不怕风、雨、虫”。“入伏不种豆，种豆加一掬”（指入伏种豆须多下籽种）。
    适于播种的土质、气候条件：
    “瑞雪兆丰年”。“春雨贵如油”。“雨洒清明好年景”。“过了谷雨没地霜（没地霜才适合禾苗生长）”。
    “高粱谷，潮黄土（潮湿的土）”。
    “要耩麦，泥里踹”。“头伏下，二伏晒，三伏有雨多耩麦”。“不怕寸水、就怕涨水”（指麦子不怕在播种时下大雨，就怕在播种后麦粒膨涨发芽时下大雨）。
    要重视选种和轮栽：“好种长好苗，好葫芦结好瓢”。“选的好，晒的干，来年打多没黑疸”。“母大子肥”。“换茬如上粪”。“芝麻、瓜，怕重茬”。“重茬谷，人受苦”。“有福没福，豆茬种谷”（指豆茬适于种谷）。
    作物出苗的规律：“七谷八麦”（指谷、麦从播种到出苗经历的时间）。“五日六日谷，七日八日麦”。
