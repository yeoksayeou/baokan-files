The United States' intensified expansion of its atomic arsenal within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has drawn widespread attention.

During the recent US-UK talks, the US agreed to supply the UK with missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads. Recently, the North Atlantic Council also announced that the US has decided to equip NATO forces with three types of missiles. According to US officials, the US has prepared a $500 million plan to supply European NATO countries with equipment for launching nuclear warheads. Furthermore, while supplying these countries with missiles, the US also intends to store nuclear warheads in these countries, controlled by Americans.

Encouraged by the aforementioned actions of the United States, West German militarists are also frantically clamoring for West German forces to be equipped with atomic weapons.

At a time when international tensions are easing following the failures of imperialist aggression in Hungary and Egypt, the US's intensified expansion of its atomic arsenal is clearly aimed at creating renewed tensions. This will trigger an atomic arms race among nations, thereby posing a threat to the security of the people of Europe and other countries around the world.

Moreover, the US intends to deepen the dependence of Western European countries within NATO on it through this practice, in order to more firmly control this military bloc and expand military bases in Western Europe. The Supreme Allied Commander Europe of NATO, US General Norstad, openly stated on the 12th of this month that missile bases should be established in "any necessary area" of Western European countries. Obviously, in the eyes of this American general, since Western European countries rely on American missiles and nuclear warheads, they should offer their national defense sovereignty to the US with both hands.

There is no doubt that countries that accept American missiles and allow the US to store nuclear warheads on their territory will place themselves in a very dangerous situation. Because, if the American generals who are keen on aggression and expansion go mad and launch an atomic war, these countries will be destroyed because they are American atomic bases, and the people of these countries will become the guinea pigs of American atomic warfare and suffer innocent sacrifices.

However, the Western European countries of NATO are not inevitably doomed to become victims of American atomic war policy. Eighteen prominent nuclear scientists in West Germany have pointed out that if West Germany explicitly and voluntarily renounces the possession of any kind of atomic weapon, it can best protect itself and best serve the cause of world peace. This is the best way for not only West Germany but also other countries to escape danger and seek peace.

Now is the time for countries to choose between the atomic arms race launched by the United States and the policy of peaceful coexistence. If the governments of those countries that follow the US policy of arms expansion and war preparation do not take all necessary measures to meet the wishes of the people on this issue, the people will never forgive them.

In order to ease international tensions and eliminate the threat of the atomic arms race, the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries are making active efforts. As a country possessing atomic weapons, the Soviet Union has repeatedly proposed that relevant countries ban the use of such weapons, while also banning the use of various rockets and artillery suitable for using atomic and hydrogen weapons, and also advocating the abolition of all military bases on foreign territories. Realizing the Soviet Union's proposition would fundamentally eliminate the threat of the atomic arms race. Therefore, the people of all countries are closely watching the discussions of the United Nations Disarmament Commission Subcommittee on this issue.

The US atomic arms race policy has become a major obstacle to easing the current international situation. Only by forcing the US to abandon this policy can the situation be truly eased and the threat to world peace be eliminated.

    缓和国际局势的主要障碍
    本报评论员
    美国在北大西洋集团国家中加紧扩张原子军备的行动，已引起人们普遍的注意。
    在不久前举行的美英会谈中，美国答应把可以装置原子弹头的导弹供给英国。最近，北大西洋集团理事会又宣布：美国已决定用三种导弹来装备北大西洋集团的军队。据美国官方人士透露，美国为了供应北大西洋集团的欧洲国家以发射原子弹头的装备，已准备了一个花费五亿美元的计划。并且，在向这些国家供应导弹的同时，美国还要将原子弹头储藏在这些国家，而由美国人加以控制。
    在美国上述行动的鼓励下，西德的军国主义分子也疯狂地叫嚷着要以原子武器装备西德的军队。
    在国际局势由于帝国主义在匈牙利和埃及的侵略行动遭受失败之后而有所缓和的时候，美国加紧扩张原子军备的行动，其目的显然是要重新制造紧张局势。这将引起各国之间的原子军备竞赛，从而造成对欧洲国家人民以及世界其他国家人民的安全的威胁。
    不仅如此，美国还要通过这种做法来加深北大西洋集团的西欧国家对它的依赖，以便于它更牢靠地控制这个军事集团，并在西欧扩充军事基地。北大西洋集团军队的统帅、美国将军诺斯塔德在本月12日就公开说，要在西欧国家的“任何必要地区”设立导弹基地。显然，在这位美国将军看来，西欧国家既然要依靠美国的导弹和原子弹头，它们就应当把它们国家的国防主权双手奉献给美国。
    毫无疑问，接受美国导弹并让美国在它的领土上储藏原子弹头的国家，将使自己处于一个非常危险的境地。因为，热衷于侵略扩张的美国将军们如果一旦疯狂起来，要发动一场原子战争，这些国家就将由于它们是美国的原子基地而遭受毁灭，这些国家的人民也将成为美国原子战争的豚鼠，而遭受无辜的牺牲。
    但是，北大西洋集团的西欧国家，并不是不可免地要成为美国原子战争政策的牺牲品。西德的十八位著名的原子核科学家已经指出，西德如果明确并且自愿地放弃拥有任何种原子武器，它就能最好不过地保护自己，并且最好不过地为世界和平的事业服务。这不但是西德而且也是别的国家摆脱危险处境、谋求和平的最好的道路。
    现在是各国在美国发动的原子军备竞赛和实行和平共处政策之间有所抉择的时候了。那些追随美国扩军备战政策的国家的政府，如果在这个问题上不采取一切必要的措施来满足人民的愿望，人民是决不会原谅它们的。
    为了缓和国际局势和消除原子军备竞赛的威胁，苏联和其他爱好和平的国家正在进行着积极的努力。作为一个拥有原子武器的国家的苏联，已一再建议有关国家禁止使用这种武器，同时禁止使用适宜于运用原子武器和氢武器的各种火箭和火炮，并且还主张撤销一切在外国领土上的军事基地。实现苏联的这种主张，就将从根本上消除原子军备竞赛的威胁。因此，各国人民正在密切地注视着联合国裁军委员会小组委员会对这个问题的讨论。
    美国的原子军备竞赛政策，已成为缓和当前国际局势的一个主要障碍，只有迫使美国放弃这一政策，局势才可能真正缓和下来，对世界和平的威胁才可能被消除。
