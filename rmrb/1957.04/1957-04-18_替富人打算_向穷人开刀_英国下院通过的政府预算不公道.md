Reports compiled by our newspaper: The British House of Commons passed the government budget for the 1957-58 fiscal year on the evening of the 15th, with 317 votes in favor and 252 votes against. According to this budget, the surplus in ordinary revenue and expenditure for this year is £461,973,300. However, including special expenditures, there is still a deficit of £125 million.

The new budget shows that the Conservative government will continue to adopt measures such as tightening wage and credit restrictions.

The new budget proposes to reduce certain taxes. However, the main beneficiaries of the tax cuts are those with annual incomes of £2,000 or more, as well as capitalists engaged in overseas trade and shipping. In the expenditure items of the new budget, the government has cut military spending by more than £70 million. The reduced military expenditure still amounts to more than £1.48 billion, accounting for 30% of the total budget. At the same time, the expenses of some social welfare programs have been cut.

    替富人打算　向穷人开刀
    英国下院通过的政府预算不公道
    本报综合报道　英国下院在15日晚以三百一十七票对二百五十二票通过了1957—58会计年度的政府预算。根据这个预算，本年度普通收支的盈余是四亿六千一百九十七万三千英镑。但是，连同特别收支一起计算，仍有一亿二千五百万英镑的赤字。
    新预算表明，保守党政府要继续采取加紧限制工资和信贷等做法。
    新预算中提出要减免若干种赋税。但是能够从减税办法得到好处的，主要是每年收入在两千英镑以上的人以及经营海外贸易业和航运业的资本家。在新预算的支出项目中，政府削减军费七千多万英镑。削减后的军费仍达十四亿八千多万英镑，占预算总支出的30％。同时，一些社会福利事业费用却受到了削减。
