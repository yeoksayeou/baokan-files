    Soviet Crop Varieties Blossom and Bear Fruit in China
    Zhao Qi
    With the development of friendship between China and the Soviet Union, more and more excellent Soviet crop varieties are being tested and promoted in various parts of China. The Soviet sunflowers and cotton that Chairman Voroshilov saw at the National Agricultural Exhibition are only a small part of the excellent Soviet crop varieties introduced by our country. In addition to them, there are also several crops such as grain, flax, and vegetables, and each crop has many varieties.

    Cotton
    Some excellent Soviet cotton varieties have been promoted in some cotton-growing areas of our country. Last year, Xinjiang planted 500,000 mu of cotton fields with the Soviet "611-Bo" cotton variety and 100,000 mu with the "108-Fu" cotton variety. The Turpan area of Xinjiang also planted the Soviet "213 Long-staple Cotton". Some cotton-growing areas in Gansu, Shanxi, and other provinces also have Soviet cotton varieties. Gansu has 20,000 mu of "611-Bo", and Shanxi has 14,000 mu of "611-Bo" and 21,000 mu of "Wo Ji No. 1". These varieties generally perform well in these areas, and most of them have the advantages of early maturity and high yield. The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps uses the "611-Bo" variety in the large-scale high-yield cotton fields in the Manas River Basin. According to tests in Taiyuan and Fenyang, Shanxi Province, "Wo Ji No. 1" performed the best among the eight varieties participating in the comparative test, with a yield 20.8% higher than the local Jinzi cotton. Shanxi Province plans to further promote this variety in the Jinzhong cotton area this year.

    Vegetables
    Agricultural scientific research institutions in various parts of China are preparing to test-plant more than 170 varieties of Soviet vegetables this year. These vegetable varieties were given to us by the Soviet Vegetable Inspection Team that came to China last year. These vegetables include: watermelon, melon, sweet peas, eggplant, pepper, onion, carrot, spinach, celery, cabbage, cauliflower, tomato, cucumber, kidney bean, pumpkin, etc.

    Before this, we had introduced cabbage, tomatoes, potatoes, etc. from the Soviet Union. A yellow tomato that has been very popular with consumers in some large cities in the past two years is grown from a variety introduced from the Soviet Union.

    The "Soviet Red" potato is also a very popular variety. It is not only suitable for planting in the Northeast region, but also grows well in Hubei, Shandong, and other places. Its yield is 20% higher than the "Nanjue" variety in the Northeast and several times higher than the local varieties in Hubei. When "Soviet Red" was initially promoted in Enshi Prefecture, Hubei, some farmers loved its high yield and did not hesitate to travel dozens of miles to exchange for this variety.

    Sunflower
    There are four Soviet sunflower varieties promoted in our country: "Zhdanov 8281", "Vnimiuk 1646", "Vnimiuk 6540", and "Saratov 10". Most of these varieties were introduced in 1953. Their excellent characteristics are: high oil content (generally 20% higher than Chinese varieties), early maturity (can mature in July), and plump seeds. Due to its early maturity, it can avoid the harm of autumn rain in the Northeast region and avoid the invasion of autumn gales in the coastal areas of Shandong.

    At present, the areas where these varieties are planted on a large scale are state-owned farms in Heilongjiang Province and the coastal areas of Shandong. The North China Agricultural Science Institute has been cultivating "Zhdanov 8281" for six years, and this institute named it "Soviet No. 1" sunflower in 1955.

    Wheat
    In 1956, our country introduced a kind of Soviet winter wheat, a kind of winter rye, and a crested wheatgrass hybrid wheat. These wheats have been distributed to agricultural science research institutes and some agricultural universities in various parts of our country for trial planting.

    Before the introduction of these varieties, the Soviet "Ukraine 0246" wheat had been widely promoted in some areas of our country. In 1955, Xinjiang planted 500,000 mu of wheat fields with this variety, accounting for 12% of the winter wheat area in the region. The results of trial planting in Xining and Guide in Qinghai Province are also very good. Individual areas in Shaanxi, Shanxi, northern Hebei, and the Lushun-Dalian area also planted this variety.

    "Ukraine 0246" not only has high yield per unit area, but also produces more flour. In 1955, the farm in Shache Prefecture, Xinjiang, harvested an average of 431 jin per mu on an area of 153 mu. According to records from the Urumqi Agricultural and Forestry Farm, each liter of "Ukraine 0246" can produce 200 to 300 grams more flour than the local white-skinned winter wheat.

    Flax
    "Torch," "Textile Worker," "Stakhanov," and "Victor" are excellent flax varieties introduced from the Soviet Union by our country in recent years. These varieties are still being tested at the Northeast Agricultural Science Institute. A kind of flax called "Wuhe Lin" which is now being promoted in many areas of Heilongjiang is also introduced from the Soviet Union in the early days of liberation. The first trial planting place of this variety was Wuhe Lin Township. So people call it "Wuhe Lin flax", and its original Soviet name has been lost. One of the characteristics of "Wuhe Lin flax" in the local area is its high yield, which is generally 10% higher than the local varieties. (Attached picture)

    苏联农作物优良品种在中国开花结果
    赵起
    随着中苏两国友谊的发展，我国各地试种和推广的苏联农作物优良品种逐渐多起来。伏罗希洛夫主席在全国农业展览会上看到的苏联向日葵、棉花，只是我国从苏联引进的优良农作物品种的一小部分，在它们以外，还有粮食、亚麻、蔬菜等几种作物，每种作物又有好多品种。
    棉花
    苏联的一些棉花良种，在我国部分棉区已经推广了。去年新疆用苏联“611波”棉种种植的棉田有五十万亩，用“108夫”棉种种植的棉田有十万亩。新疆吐鲁番一带还种过苏联的“213长绒棉”。甘肃、山西等省的一些棉区也有苏联棉种。甘肃有两万亩“611波”，山西有一万四千亩“611波”和两万一千亩“涡及一号”。这些品种在这些地区的一般表现良好，多数具有早熟、产量高的优点。新疆生产建设部队在玛纳斯河流域的大面积棉花丰产田，就是采用的“611波”品种。“涡及一号”，据山西省的太原、汾阳的试验，在八个共同参加比较试验的品种中，它的表现最好，产量比当地的金字棉高20.8％。山西省今年准备在晋中棉区进一步推广这个品种。
    蔬菜
    我国各地农业科学试验研究机构，准备在今年开始试种一百七十多个品种的苏联蔬菜。这些蔬菜品种是去年来我国的苏联蔬菜考察团赠给我们的。这些蔬菜包括：西瓜、甜瓜、甜豌豆、茄子、辣椒、洋葱、胡萝卜、菠菜、芹菜、甘蓝、花椰菜、西红柿、黄瓜、菜豆、南瓜等。
    在这以前，我们曾由苏联引进过甘蓝、西红柿、马铃薯等。近两年在一些大的市镇上深受消费者欢迎的一种黄色的西红柿，就是用由苏联引进的品种种出来的。
    “苏联红”马铃薯也是很受欢迎的一个品种。它不仅适宜在东北地区种植，在湖北、山东等地也长得很好。它的产量，在东北比“南爵”种高20％，在湖北比当地品种高几倍。“苏联红”在湖北恩施专区初步推广的时候，有的农民爱它的产量高，不惜跑几十里地去调换这个品种。
    向日葵
    在我国推广的苏联向日葵品种有四个：“日丹诺夫8281”“佛尼母克1646”“佛尼母克6540”“萨拉托夫10号”。这些品种多数是1953年引进来的。它们的优良特性是：含油率高（一般较我国种高20％），成熟期早（在7月可熟），籽实饱满。由于它的成熟期早，在东北地区可以避免秋雨的危害，在山东沿海地区可以躲开秋后大风的侵袭。
    目前大面积种植这些品种的地区有黑龙江省和山东沿海一带的国营农场。华北农业科学研究所栽培“日丹诺夫8281”已经有六年历史，这个所在1955年命名为“苏联一号”向日葵。
    小麦
    1956年我国从苏联引进一种冬小麦、一种冬黑麦和一种鹅冠草杂交种小麦。这些小麦已分配给我国各地农业科学研究所和部分农业大学试种。
    在这些品种引进以前，我国个别地区已大量推广了苏联的“乌克兰0246”小麦。1955年新疆种植这个品种的麦田有五十万亩，占全区冬麦面积的12％。青海省的西宁、贵德等地试种的结果也很好。陕西、山西、河北北部的个别地区和旅大一带也有种这个品种的。
      “乌克兰0246”不但单位产量高，而且出粉多。1955年新疆莎车专区农场在一百五十三亩面积上，平均每亩收到四百三十一斤。据乌鲁木齐农林场记载，每升“乌克兰0246”比当地白皮冬麦可多出二百到三百克面粉。
    亚麻
    “火炬”“纺织工人”“斯塔哈诺夫”“胜利者”是我国近年来由苏联引进的亚麻优良品种。这些品种还在东北农业科学研究所试种中。现在在黑龙江许多地区推广的一种叫“五河林”亚麻也是在解放初期从苏联引进的。这个品种最初试种地方是五河林乡。于是人们就叫它“五河林亚麻”，它的苏联原名则失传了。“五河林亚麻”在当地的特点之一是产量高，比当地品种一般高10％。（附图片）
