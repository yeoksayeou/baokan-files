A letter from the President's Office of the Beijing University of Political Science and Law: Yang Jun's article "We Can't Let Children Behave So Recklessly," published in the People's Daily on February 23rd, is correct in its criticism of the facts.

    Most comrades in our university and the person criticized welcome this criticism. Some parents are determined to strengthen their discipline over their children in the future, and those who have consistently neglected educating their children have also become alert.

    北京政法学院院长办公室来信：人民日报2月23日刊登杨俊同志的“不能让孩子这样胡作非为”，他所批评的事实是正确的。
    我院的大多数同志和被批评者，对这个批评都表示欢迎。有些家长决心今后要加强对孩子的管教，一贯不重视教育孩子的人也引起了警惕。
