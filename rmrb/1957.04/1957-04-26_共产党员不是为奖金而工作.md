    Communist Party Members Don't Work for Bonuses

    After reading the recent issues of the People's Daily regarding the discussion on enterprise bonuses, two questions involuntarily emerged in my mind: What is the purpose of implementing a bonus system in factories and enterprises? And what do Communist Party members work for?

    Everyone knows that without administrative management and organizational work, production activities in a factory would be inconceivable. At the same time, without the political work of Party and Youth League organizations, developing production would also be inconceivable. However, the completion and over-completion of production tasks ultimately depend on the productive labor of the workers. From this starting point, I believe that the focus of factory and enterprise bonuses should be on those directly involved in production, followed by administrative, Party, Youth League, and trade union staff. Material rewards should be given to those directly involved in production, while non-direct production personnel can adopt the general reward methods implemented in state organs, without the need for material rewards. It is extremely unreasonable and unfair that the bonuses received by the full-time cadres of the Party, Youth League, and trade union in Tangshan Steel Plant greatly exceed those of the workers. The view that "leaders put in a lot of effort, so it is reasonable for them to receive more bonuses than ordinary employees" is untenable. Who can say that the completion of factory production tasks has nothing to do with the leadership organs? However, who can say that a certain working relationship necessitates the issuance of bonuses?

    The purpose of bonuses is to stimulate labor production enthusiasm and creativity. In order to achieve this goal, the reward standards must be strictly controlled, and the recipients of the awards must be those who have truly made significant inventions or achieved remarkable results in completing the national plan. If the control is not strict, and everyone working in the factory receives a bonus, in reality, such a reward will not only fail to stimulate production but will also foster incorrect thinking in some people.

    I think that no one would say they joined the Party for bonuses when they joined, otherwise, they would be tarnishing the glorious title of Party member. Comrade Han Baorui used himself as an example to try to illustrate that if the factory's administrative, Party, Youth League, and trade union cadres do not receive bonuses, no one will want to be a cadre. This view is also unfounded. In fact, I know that some factory administrative work cadres do not receive bonuses. Some, after being promoted from workers to management personnel, have reduced salaries compared to the past, but they still work conscientiously because they know what they are working for. They feel that it is a great honor to be entrusted by the Party and the state to work, to endure hardship first and enjoy pleasure later.

    In any case, bonuses cannot become the work requirement and standard for Communist Party members. The Communist Party is transforming the world. We have already seen that the selfish and self-interested thinking caused by private ownership since class society is being transformed, and has been transformed in many people. They disregard personal interests and work loyally for the Party, even sacrificing their lives. When Dong Cunrui stepped forward to blow up the pillbox, when Luo Shengjiao gave his life to save Cui Ying, when Wang Xiaohe, Liu Hulan, and Ding Youjun were unyielding in front of the enemy and sacrificed for the Party, they had a lofty thought: for humanity; not for bonuses.

    I believe that state organ staff (including full-time cadres in factories and enterprises) all have their fixed salaries. They should give full play to their abilities within the scope of their duties. If the task is completed or over-completed, it only reflects that they have fulfilled their responsibilities, and there is no reason to receive any bonuses!

### 共产党员不是为奖金而工作

    共产党员不是为奖金而工作
    读了人民日报最近几期关于企业奖金问题的讨论以后，我的思想上不由地涌现出两个问题：工厂企业实行奖励制度是为了什么？共产党员为什么而工作？
    谁都知道，一个工厂如果没有行政管理和组织工作，要进行生产活动是不可设想的。同时，没有党、团组织的政治工作，要发展生产也是不可设想的。但是，生产任务的完成和超额完成，归根结底劳动者的生产劳动起着决定性的作用。从这一点出发，我认为工厂企业的奖励重点应该是生产的直接参加者，其次是行政、党、团、工会工作人员。对于生产的直接参加者应当实行物质奖励，而对于非直接参加生产的人员则可以采取国家机关一般实行的奖励办法，不必实行物质奖励。唐山钢厂党、团、工会脱产干部所得奖金大大超过工人，是极不合理和极不公平的。那种认为“领导人出力不小，比一般职工多拿些奖金也是合情合理”的看法是站不住脚的。谁能说工厂生产任务的完成同领导机关没有关系呢？但是，谁能说有了一定的工作关系就有必要发给奖金呢？
    奖金的目的是为了刺激劳动生产积极性和创造性。为了达到这个目的，在奖励标准上必须严格控制，受奖人和单位必须是真正有重大创造发明或完成国家计划有显著成绩的。如果控制不严，所有在工厂工作的人都拿到奖金，实在说，这种奖励不但不能刺激生产，反会助长一些人发展不正确的思想。
    我想任何人在加入党的时候，决不会说他为奖金而来的，否则，他就沾污了党员的光荣称号。韩宝瑞同志以他个人为例，企图说明如果工厂行政、党、团、工会干部不拿奖金就没人当干部了。这种看法也是没根据的。事实上我所知道有一些工厂行政工作干部是不拿奖金的，有些从工人提为管理人员以后，工资是比过去减少了，但是他们还是兢兢业业地工作，因为他们知道为什么而工作。他们觉得，受党和国家委托而工作，吃苦在先，享乐在后，是极大的光荣。
    不管怎么说，奖金不能成为共产党员的工作要求和标准。共产党是改造世界的，我们已经看到：有阶级社会以来由于私有制而产生的自私自利思想正在被改造，在很多人身上已经被改造掉。他们不顾个人利益而忠诚地为党工作，甚至牺牲自己的生命。当董存瑞挺身炸碉堡的时候，罗盛教舍身救崔莹的时候，王孝和、刘胡兰、丁佑君在敌人面前坚贞不屈为党牺牲的时候，他（她）们有着一个崇高的思想：为了人类；而不是为了奖金。
    我认为国家机关工作人员（包括工厂企业脱产干部在内）都有他的定额工资。他们应当在这个职务范围内尽量发挥自己的能力，如果任务完成了或者超额完成了，只是反映了他们尽了自己的职责，没有什么理由去拿什么奖金！
