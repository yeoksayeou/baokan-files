Xinhua News Agency, 28th: In the current busy season of agricultural production, officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are actively supporting farmers in striving for a bumper harvest this year. Many senior military officers enthusiastically participated in agricultural labor.

　　Old Red Army Lieutenant Colonel Jin Shanghai from a certain unit stationed in Guangdong, after hearing the news about helping farmers repair dikes, insisted on participating in the project despite his severely wounded body from the war. He said, "Don't think I'm old and not in good health. I also want to contribute to the bumper agricultural harvest and add a brick to socialism." During thirteen days of intense physical labor, he always carried sand and transported soil with his comrades.岳岳山, the regimental commander of a certain artillery regiment, after accepting the task of supporting farmers in building a water conservancy project, braved the heavy rain to survey the terrain and divide work areas with government cadres, and personally carried his backpack to the construction site to work with the soldiers. Zhu Guang, a senior colonel and director of the Political Department of a certain unit stationed in Gansu, and Cai Zhonghe, a junior major and deputy director, led their troops to help agricultural cooperatives transport fertilizer. They personally went to the toilets, pigsties, and stables near the barracks to dig manure, and led the way carrying large baskets of manure between them.

　　Many county military service bureaus in Hubei and Henan have dispatched a large number of cadres to the countryside to help farmers with production. The officers who went to the countryside ate, lived, and worked with the farmers, and some even pulled plows and dragged harrows with the farmers. A certain unit of the Public Security Army stationed on Hainan Island, upon discovering a shortage of labor in a nearby agricultural cooperative, organized hundreds of officers and soldiers to help them with work; due to insufficient animal power, they formed a plowing team of more than sixty people, using manpower to plow the land. In three days, they plowed 60.2 mu of land, harrowed 24.98 mu of land, reinforced dams, dug 4,200 meters of ditches, and repaired sluice gates.

　　In areas where drought was detected, the troops are vigorously supporting agricultural cooperatives in fighting drought and preventing disasters. In order to prevent the agricultural cooperatives' production increase plan from being affected, the officers and soldiers of a certain unit stationed in Sichuan formed a drought-fighting team, watering with buckets. During the drought-fighting period, they even gave up Sundays. (Special contribution to this newspaper)

    许多高级军官热忱参加农业生产
    老红军金尚海中校挑沙传土，政治部主任朱光挖粪抬粪筐
    新华社28日讯　在目前农业生产繁忙的季节里，中国人民解放军的军官和士兵们积极支援农民争取今年大丰收。许多高级军官热忱地参加了农业劳动。
    驻广东某部老红军金尚海中校听到帮助农民修堤的消息以后，不顾自己在战争中受过重伤的身体，坚持要参加这项工程。他说：“不要看我年纪大，身体不好，我也要为农业大丰收出一分力，为社会主义添一块砖。”在十三天紧张的体力劳动中，他始终和同志们一道挑沙传土。某炮兵团长岳山接受了支援农民兴修一项水利工程的任务后，就冒着大雨同政府干部去勘察地形，划分工区，并且亲自扛着背包赶到工地和战士们一块劳动。驻甘肃某部政治部主任朱光上校、副主任蔡仲和少校率领部队帮助农业社运肥料。他们亲自到营房附近的厕所里、猪圈里和马厩里去挖粪，并且两人抬着一大筐粪领头走。
    湖北、河南许多县兵役局抽出了大批干部下乡帮助农民生产。下乡的军官与农民同吃、同住、同劳动，有的还与农民一道拉犁拖耙。驻海南岛公安军某部发现附近农业社缺乏劳动力，就组织数百名官兵去帮他们干活；由于畜力不足，他们又组成六十多人的拉犁队，用人力翻耕土地。三天功夫，他们犁田六十点二亩，耙田二十四点九八亩，加固水坝、挖水沟四千二百公尺，还修好了水闸。
    在发现旱象的地区，部队正大力支援农业社抗旱防灾。驻四川某地部队，为了不让农业社增产计划受到影响，官兵们组成了抗旱队，用戽斗浇水，在抗旱期中，他们连星期日都放弃了。（本报特约稿）
