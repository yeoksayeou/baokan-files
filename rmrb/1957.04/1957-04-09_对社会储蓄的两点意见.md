    Two Opinions on Social Savings
    Han Hongtai

    After reading the People's Daily editorial of March 4th, "Actively Participate in Social Savings," I think there are two issues worth studying:

    (1) Whether daily-use money needs to be vigorously absorbed by banks. The editorial says: "If a person saves 30 yuan at the beginning of the month and withdraws 1 yuan every day for daily use, taking 30 days to withdraw it all, then his average daily deposit in the bank will be 15.5 yuan, and the state can invest this money in construction." I think this is only one side of the issue. The other side of the issue is that the national bank will incur a huge burden in terms of manpower and resources to cope with this daily and frequent payment work. For example, taking Shanghai's 1.2 million employees as an example, if each person pays 1 yuan to the bank every day for daily use, it will increase the transaction volume by 1.2 million transactions per day. In this way, the bank will need to set up many more institutions, cadres, account pages, and vouchers to cope with this vast amount of work, which not only causes waste in economic accounting but also, to a certain extent, affects or hinders the development of long-term savings business. Therefore, I believe that it is not necessary for banks to vigorously organize the absorption of money that employees or residents need for daily use. If it is necessary to absorb daily-use funds, the best way is to change the way wages are paid from once a month to twice or three times a month.

    (2) Regarding social savings or collective savings, the editorial introduced the experience of a certain street in Tianjin in saving five cents per household per day. This practice plays a certain role in cultivating people's saving habits, but this savings method has great limitations. For employees with fixed incomes or those with better economic conditions, it is completely unnecessary to adopt this method. At the same time, this savings method will cause extremely heavy workloads for neighborhood cadres and is prone to coercion and embezzlement. I believe that although this savings method is voluntarily organized by residents, it should not be universally promoted. For those working people with no fixed income or very little income, the above-mentioned approach has a certain effect. At the same time, it can only be used as a transitional form for cultivating saving habits. After a certain period, they should be guided to open accounts directly with the bank and save separately.

    Of course, I am not saying that banks can ignore the savings effect of accumulating small amounts into large ones. On the contrary, at a time when the general living standards in our country are not high today, and the state is calling on us to carry out the movement to increase production and practice economy, it is of practical significance to promote accumulating small amounts into large ones, arranging life reasonably, practicing thrift and economy, and participating in savings. But I think we should adopt the most reasonable and economical methods to attract savings.

    Editor's note: We basically agree with Comrade Han Hongtai's views. Regarding the first question, the purpose of the example in the editorial is to illustrate the principle of accumulating small amounts into large ones, telling everyone not to look down on small amounts of money. It is not really intended for everyone to withdraw one yuan from the bank every day. In fact, people would not do this. Regarding the second question, our view is: if the masses truly and completely voluntarily do this, and publicly elect someone to handle it, the bank should accept it and not obstruct it. If the masses ask neighborhood cadres to help, they can also help. However, the leadership does not need to overemphasize collective savings, and there should be no slightest coercion. As for households with higher incomes on the streets, we should focus on encouraging them to save separately, and not blindly advocate collective savings.

    对社会储蓄的两点意见
    韩宏泰
    看了3月4日人民日报“积极参加社会储蓄”的社论以后，我觉得有两个问题值得研究一下：
    （一）关于日常待用的钱是否需要银行大力组织吸收的问题。社论说：“如果一个人月初储蓄三十元，每天取一元零用，三十天取完，这样，他每天在银行的存款平均就有十五元五角，国家就可以把这笔钱投入建设。”我认为这只是问题的一面，问题的另一面是：国家银行为了应付这种日常的频繁支付工作，将会造成人力物力上的巨大负荷。如以上海一百二十万职工为例，每人每天都向银行支付一元零用，每天就要增加一百二十万笔的交易量，这样，银行就需要再增设许多机构、干部、帐页传票来应付这种浩繁的工作，这在经济核算上不仅造成浪费，而且在一定程度上，也会影响或阻碍长期储蓄业务的开展。因此我认为银行对职工或居民日常必需要用的钱，没有必要去大力组织吸收。如果一定要吸收日常待用资金，最好的办法是把工资由一月发放一次改为一月分二次或三次发放。
    （二）关于社会储蓄或集体储蓄的问题，社论中介绍了天津某街每户每天节约五分钱的经验。这种作法对培养人民节约习惯，起一定的作用，但是这种储蓄方式有很大的局限性，对有固定收入的职工或经济条件较好的对象，完全不需要采取这种方式。同时，这种储蓄方式将造成里弄干部极其繁重的工作负担，并且易于发生强迫命令和错款舞弊等现象。我认为这种储蓄方式虽是居民自愿组织，但不宜普遍推广。对那些无固定收入或收入极微的劳动人民，采用上述做法，有其一定作用。同时也只能作为培养节约储蓄习惯的一种过渡形式，一定时期以后，应诱导他们径向银行开户，单独存储。
    当然，我并不是说银行可以忽视集零为整的储蓄作用。恰恰相反，在我国今天生活水平一般还不高，国家正号召我们开展增产节约运动的时候，宣传集零为整合理安排生活，勤俭节约，参加储蓄，是有现实意义的。但是我觉得应采取最合理最节约的办法来吸取储蓄。
    编者按：韩宏泰同志的意见，我们基本同意。关于第一个问题，社论所举的例子目的在于说明聚零为整的原则，告诉大家不要看不起少量的钱。并不是真要大家每天到银行取一元。事实上人们也不会这样做的。关于第二个问题，我们的看法是：如果群众真正完全自愿这样做，并且公推出人来办理，银行应该接受，不应阻挠。群众如果要求里弄干部帮助做，也可以帮助一下。但领导上不必过分强调集体储蓄，更不可有丝毫勉强。至于街道上收入较多的户，更应着重鼓励他们单独存储，不要盲目提倡集体存储。
