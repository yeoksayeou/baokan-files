    A commentator from Cairo Radio said on April 26th that the talks between the Syrian President and the Egyptian President in Cairo on April 25th, as well as the current consultations among Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia in Saudi Arabia, have one fundamental purpose: to strengthen cooperation among Arab nations to counter imperialist conspiracies in the Middle East.
