Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch from New York: The Asian-African Group at the United Nations issued a statement on the 10th, condemning France for undermining the United Nations General Assembly's desire for a peaceful resolution to the Algerian question.

The Liberian Ambassador, Charles King, President of the Asian-African Group for April, read a statement after a closed meeting of the group, saying that the Asian-African Group had considered the recent developments in Algeria and noted that these developments were in no way consistent with the resolution unanimously adopted by the last United Nations General Assembly, which hoped that the Algerian question could be resolved peacefully, democratically, and justly in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter.

The statement also said that the Asian-African Group believes that it is clearly a matter of concern to all members of the United Nations General Assembly that the unanimous hope of the United Nations General Assembly has been undermined and denied. In this situation, the Asian-African Group recommends taking action to bring this inconsistency with its expressed wishes to the attention of the United Nations.

Xinhua News Agency, April 11th dispatch from TASS, Paris, April 10th: The "International Week for Peace in Algeria," which began on April 7th in accordance with the decision of the World Federation of Trade Unions, has been widely and enthusiastically responded to in France.

The French General Confederation of Labor and the National Peace Council are actively participating in the activities of the "Peace Week." The National Peace Council has also specifically issued an appeal to the Prime Minister. Currently, the "International Week for Peace in Algeria" has been combined with the mass movement against the violence and torture inflicted by French military police on Algerian patriots. In many schools, professors, teachers, and students have protested against these actions.

    据新华社11日讯　纽约消息：联合国亚非集团10日发表声明，谴责法国破坏联合国大会关于和平解决阿尔及利亚问题的意愿。
    亚非集团4月份主席、利比里亚大使查尔斯·金在这个集团的一次秘密会议之后宣读的一项声明说，亚非集团考虑了阿尔及利亚最近局势的发展，并且注意到这些发展同上届联合国大会所一致通过的，希望阿尔及利亚问题能获得符合联合国宪章原则的和平、民主和公正的解决的决议毫无相符之处。
    声明还说，亚非集团认为，对联合国大会一切成员说来，这显然是一桩值得关切的事：联合国大会的一致希望已经被破坏和被否认了。在这种情形下，亚非集团建议采取行动，提请联合国注意这种同它所表达的愿望不一致的状况。
    据新华社11日讯　据塔斯社巴黎10日讯：根据世界工会联合会的决定从4月7日开始举行的“国际争取阿尔及利亚和平周”在法国得到广泛热烈的响应。
    法国总工会和全国和平理事会都积极参加“和平周”的活动。全国和平理事会还特地发表了致内阁总理的呼吁书。目前，“国际争取阿尔及利亚和平周”已经同反对法国军警对阿尔及利亚爱国者施行暴行和拷打的群众性运动结合在一起了。在许多学校里，教授、教师和学生都对这些行为提出了抗议。
