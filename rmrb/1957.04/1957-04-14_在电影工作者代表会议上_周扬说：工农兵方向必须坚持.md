    Xinhua News Agency, 12th - The Chinese Film Workers' Representative Meeting continued today. Zhou Yang, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, attended and delivered a speech. He congratulated the soon-to-be-established China Film Workers' Association on playing an important role in uniting the national film industry and promoting the development of the film industry. He hoped that Chinese film workers at home and abroad would unite under the banner of patriotism and establish broader friendly relations with film artists from all countries in the cause of consolidating world peace. Zhou Yang pointed out that all film workers have made significant contributions in recent years. To this end, the Ministry of Culture has rewarded many outstanding films and creators; at the same time, a group of advanced film distribution and screening workers who have worked hard among the masses for many years have been selected nationwide, which is an honor for the film industry.
    Zhou Yang believes that in order to implement the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" in film work, it is necessary to promote the enthusiasm and creativity of all film workers and overcome undesirable work styles such as dogmatism and sectarianism.
    Zhou Yang emphatically pointed out that the direction of film art serving workers, peasants, and soldiers must be adhered to. The subject matter should be as broad as possible, and the style should be diverse. The requirements for film quality should not be forced to be uniform, and there should be some unevenness. Film production should ensure a certain quantity and strive to improve quality, seeking quality in quantity. This will enable all film workers to have opportunities to give full play to their strengths and compete with each other. The progressive tradition of China's film industry should be respected, and good experiences should be promoted. Cutting off history and negating tradition is actually a manifestation of sectarian ideology. Communist Party members among film workers should humbly learn from experienced, non-Party film artists and should not have any complacency.
    Zhou Yang finally called on the film industry to unite more closely, establish good cooperative relationships in creation, delve into the lives of the masses, exchange creative experiences, carry out film criticism and research work, study the history of China's film industry, and learn from the advanced experiences of foreign film art.
    Xia Yan, Deputy Minister of Culture, also spoke at the meeting. He called on all film workers to overcome sectarian sentiments and strengthen unity.
    Xia Yan said that to improve the artistic level of films, it is necessary for film workers to study diligently, especially to create an atmosphere of academic research in the film industry.
    Xia Yan said that when the film industry discusses how to implement the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," the vast majority of people demand strengthened leadership rather than no leadership. Therefore, leaders must delve into the masses, connect with reality, and become experts in the cause they lead. He hoped that film practitioners would respect the leadership while also supervising the leadership.
    In his speech, Xia Yan called on all film workers to carry forward the traditional hard-working and simple style of the Chinese film industry, increase production and practice economy, strive to reduce production costs, and save funds for the country.
    At the end of his speech, Xia Yan extended his regards to the film workers in Hong Kong, praising their artistic achievements.

    在电影工作者代表会议上
    周扬说：工农兵方向必须坚持
    新华社12日讯　中国电影工作者代表会议今天继续开会。中共中央宣传部副部长周扬到会讲话。他预祝即将成立的中国电影工作者联谊会在团结全国电影界和促进电影事业的发展上起重要作用。他希望我国电影工作者和在海外的中国电影工作者在爱国主义的旗帜下团结起来，并在巩固世界和平的事业中和各国的电影艺术家建立更广泛的友好联系。周扬指出，几年来全体电影工作者已经作了重大贡献，为此，文化部奖励了许多优秀影片和创作人员；同时又在全国范围内选出了常年在群众中艰苦工作的一批先进电影发行、放映工作者，这是电影界的光荣。
    周扬认为，要在电影工作中贯彻执行“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，必须发扬全体电影工作者的积极性、创造性，克服教条主义、宗派主义等不良作风。
    周扬着重指出，电影艺术为工农兵服务的方向必须坚持。取材应力求广泛，风格应该多样。对影片质量的要求也不能强求一律，应该容许有参差不齐的状况。影片生产既要保证一定数量，又要努力提高质量，在数量中求得质量。这样才能使所有的电影工作者都有发挥所长、相互竞赛的机会。我国电影事业的进步传统应当受到尊重，好的经验应当加以发扬。割断历史，否定传统，实际上是宗派主义思想的一种表现。电影工作者中的共产党员应该虚心地向有经验的、党外的电影艺术家学习，不应有丝毫骄傲自满的情绪。
    周扬最后要求电影界更密切地团结，建立在创作上的良好的合作关系，深入群众生活，互相交流创作经验，开展电影评论和研究工作，研究我国电影事业的历史，学习外国电影艺术的先进经验。
    文化部副部长夏衍也在会上讲了话。他要求全体电影工作者克服宗派主义情绪，加强团结。
    夏衍说，要提高影片的艺术水平，必需由电影工作者刻苦钻研，特别要在电影界造成学术研究的空气。
    夏衍说，电影界在讨论如何贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针时，绝大部分人都要求加强领导而不是不要领导。因此，领导者必须深入群众，联系实际，使自己成为所领导的事业的专家。他希望电影从业人员尊重领导，同时也要监督领导。
    夏衍在讲话中，要求全体电影工作者发扬中国电影事业传统的艰苦朴质作风，增产节约，争取降低制片成本，为国家节约资金。
    夏衍在讲话的最后，向在香港的电影工作者致意，赞扬了他们的艺术成就。
