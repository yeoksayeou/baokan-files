    Friendship is Everywhere in Life

    Living in Poland and frequently interacting with Polish friends, I often feel immersed in warm friendship.

    As a Chinese person in Poland, no matter where I go, I encounter all sorts of questions that need answering. “How big is China?” “What mountains and rivers does China have? How high are the mountains, how long are the rivers?” “What trees, flowers, and grasses does China have?” “How many characters are there in the Chinese language?” “Why do Chinese people like to eat rice?” “Why do Chinese people all have black hair and black eyes?”... Two summers ago, in a park in Krakow, the ancient cultural city of Poland, I was surrounded by a group of Young Pioneers who bombarded me with such a series of questions. Their yearning for and admiration of New China made them perpetually unsatisfied with the answers. In July 1953, when I visited Gdańsk, a port city on the Baltic Sea, I encountered a similar situation. At that time, a group of Polish elementary school students traveling on the coast pulled me onto a ship to join their get-together. As soon as I got on board, it was: “Sing a Chinese song!” “Tell a story about the Chinese revolution!” “Tell another one!” “Tell me, have you seen Mao Zedong?” The children’s requests were endless. As a result, I had to cancel my planned visits for the day and spent most of the day with them on the ship.

    Is it only because children are curious that they have so many questions? No, the concern for New China and the desire to learn more about New China are universal. "To go to China and see," has become one of the lifelong aspirations of many Polish friends. This is not an exaggeration. Last November, when I visited the Chinese Department of the University of Warsaw, the students there answered my questions by saying that hoping to go to China was one of their important goals in studying Chinese; they repeatedly stated that this was "everyone's common wish." All the Polish friends I have come into contact with have unanimously expressed this wish. Similarly, they often put me in the "offensive" of questions. Many intellectuals in Warsaw often ask me: "Why don't you set up a cultural center in Warsaw?" "Why not translate Chinese classical literary works—poems, fairy tales, fables, etc.—into foreign languages and sell them in Warsaw?" As for Polish friends who have been to China, they simply cannot help but talk about China. Once, Comrade Barcewski, the person in charge of the Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw, opened up to me during my visit, talking at length about his experiences in China. He said that he would talk about China to anyone he met, "I feel suffocated if I don't talk about it."

    When Chinese people just learn to say a few words in Polish, it makes Polish friends feel very happy and excited. In January of this year, when I accompanied the Chinese government delegation led by Premier Zhou Enlai to visit a textile factory in the city of Lodz, I asked an elderly female worker to place a long-distance call to Warsaw for me. As soon as she heard me speak two sentences in Polish, she could not hide her excitement, and said to me in a trembling voice: "When I see you coming so far to our Poland, and that among the 600 million Chinese people, someone can speak our Polish language, I am so happy, my friend!" She held my hands tightly for a long time.

    After living in Poland for a few years, I have also come to a small conclusion: whenever I go for a walk in the park on a day off, don’t forget to bring some Chinese stamps, pictures, or even small objects such as cigarette boxes and matchboxes, so as not to disappoint the Polish children I encounter. That time in the park in Krakow, I carried more than one hundred Chinese stamps (called znaczki in Polish), and they were all distributed in no time. The disappointed expressions of the children who didn't get them were unforgettable. When I said goodbye to these children that time, I wrote in Chinese for each of them: "May Sino-Polish friendship develop forever!" and they left happily.

    If it is not a stamp but a Mao Zedong commemorative badge, then the excitement it causes is even more indescribable. In June of the year before last, when Vice Premier Peng Dehuai led the Chinese government delegation to visit the Children's Palace in Katowice, a major industrial center in Poland, two Polish girls aged seven or eight followed the delegation for more than two hours from beginning to end. Finally, they expressed their wish: to have a Mao Zedong commemorative badge. After the guests pinned two badges on their chests, the two innocent children cheered and shouted: "Mao Zedong, Mao Zedong! I have a Mao Zedong by my side!" In July 1954, when the Chinese cultural delegation visited Zakopane, a famous scenic spot in southern Poland, they visited the Lenin Memorial Hall in the nearby village of Poronin (Lenin had worked here before the October Revolution). During the contact with local residents, a comrade of the delegation gave a Mao Zedong commemorative badge to a blonde girl. When the girl saluted and thanked him, the old grandmother standing behind her took out a handkerchief and wiped her tears. After a moment of silence, the old grandmother bent down and said to her granddaughter: "Remember, this was given to you by a Chinese uncle from the other side of the earth! This is the most precious souvenir!"

    Why is the Polish people's friendship with the Chinese people so deep? The old miner Raczowski said it well: "In our city, on the streets, on the trams, you can often see Chinese students. You see, the cause of socialism and common ideals connect us, these yellow-haired, black-haired people from all over the world!" On my way back to Warsaw from Gdansk after the sea party with the Polish children, the old car driver, who was nearly seventy years old and had lived in China, said to me:
    "See? It is easy for Polish people and Chinese people to become friends. You know, both China and Poland were oppressed nations in modern history!" The old driver's words reminded me of Mr. Lu Xun's early emphasis on introducing the literary works of Eastern European nations to Chinese readers. Mr. Lu Xun had this view: because they are both oppressed nations (referring to China and the nations of Eastern Europe before liberation), they have common feelings and voices. I think this should be one of the historical roots of the friendship between the Chinese and Polish people!

### 生活处处是友情

    生活处处是友情
    生活在波兰，常常同波兰朋友接触，使我经常感到浴身在温暖的友情当中。
    一个中国人在波兰，不论走到哪里，会碰到各式各样的问题要你答复。“中国地方有多大？”“中国有些什么山，什么河？山有多高，河有多长？”“中国有些什么树，什么花，什么草？”“中国文字有多少字？”“中国人为什么爱吃大米？”“中国人为什么都是黑头发，黑眼珠？”……两年前的夏天，我在波兰文化古城克拉科夫的公园里，就被一群少先队员用这样一连串的问题包围住了。对新中国的向往和爱慕使他们对问题的答案永远感到不满足。1953年7月我到波罗的海港口革但斯克访问的时候，也遇到了同样的情况。那时，一队在海滨旅行的波兰小学生拉我到轮船上参加他们的联欢会。谁知一上船去就是：“唱一支中国歌吧！”“讲一个中国革命故事吧！”“再讲一个吧！”“告诉我，你看见过毛泽东吗？”小朋友们的要求简直没有个完。结果我不得不取消了当天原订的访问计划，一直在船上同他们度过了大半天。
    是不是因为孩子们会好奇才有这么多的问题呢？不，对新中国的关心，想要更多地了解新中国的愿望，是普遍存在的。“到中国去看看”，这成了许许多多波兰朋友的毕生愿望之一。这样说决不是夸大。去年11月我访问华沙大学中文系的时候，那里的学生回答我的问题说，希望到中国去是他们研究中文的重要目的之一；他们还一再声明：这是“大家的共同愿望”。凡是我所接触到的波兰朋友，也都不约而同地表示过这样的愿望。同样，他们也常常使我陷入问题的“进攻”里。华沙的许多知识分子还常常问我：“为什么你们不在华沙设立文化站？”“为什么不把中国古典文学作品——诗歌、童话、寓言等等译成外文在华沙出售？”至于到过中国的波兰朋友，简直更是言必谈中国了。一次，华沙文化科学宫的负责人巴尔塞夫斯基同志就在我去参观的时候，对我打开了话匣子，大谈中国见闻。他说，他不管见谁都要谈谈中国，“不谈就闷的慌。”
    中国人刚学会讲几句波兰话，就会使得波兰朋友感到十分喜悦和激动。今年1月间，我随同周恩来总理率领的中国政府代表团到罗兹市一个纺织厂参观时，曾经请求一位老年女工替我摇给华沙的长途电话。她一听我说了两句波兰话，就毫不掩饰她的激动，颤着声音对我说：“我一看到你们跑这么远到我们波兰来，而且在六万万中国人当中竟有人会讲我们波兰话，我真是太高兴了，我的朋友！”她久久地紧握我的双手不放。
    在波兰生活了几年，我还得出一条小小的经验：每逢休息日到公园去散步时，不要忘记带点中国邮票、画片、或甚至是香烟盒、火柴盒之类的小物件，免得使碰到的波兰小朋友们失望。那次在克拉科夫的公园里，我随身带了一百多张中国邮票（波兰语叫兹纳契基），不一会便分发一光。没有分到的小朋友们那种失望的神情是令人难忘的。那次我同这些孩子们告别时，给他们每个人用中文写了一句“中波友谊永远发展！”他们才高高兴兴地走了。
    如果不是邮票而是一枚毛泽东纪念章，那么它所引起的激动就更是难以形容了。前年6月，彭德怀副总理率领中国政府代表团在波兰大工业中心卡托维兹市的少年宫参观时，两个七、八岁的波兰女孩从始至终跟着代表团一直走了两个多小时。最后她们才表明自己的愿望：要一枚毛泽东纪念章。当客人把两枚纪念章分别戴在她们胸前以后，这两个天真的小朋友就欢欣雀跃地高喊起来：“毛泽东，毛泽东！我身边有了个毛泽东！”1954年7月，中国文化代表团在波兰南部著名风景区萨科巴尼参观的时候，曾经访问了附近波罗宁村的列宁纪念馆（十月革命前，列宁曾在此地工作过）。在同当地居民接触当中，代表团一位同志把一枚毛泽东纪念章送给了一个黄发小姑娘。当小姑娘敬礼致谢时，站在她身后的老祖母却摸出手帕擦起眼泪来了。沉默了一会儿，老祖母弯下身去对孙女说：“记住，这是从地球那一边来的中国叔叔送给你的！这是最珍贵的纪念啊！”
    为什么波兰人民对中国人民的友谊这么深厚呢？那个老矿工拉曹夫斯基说得好：“在我们的城市里，大街上，电车上，到处都常常可以看到中国学生。你看，社会主义事业和共同的理想把我们这些黄头发、黑头发、天南海北的人们都联结在一起了！”在我那次从革但斯克同波兰小朋友在海上联欢以后回华沙的路上，那位年近七旬、曾经在中国侨居过的老汽车司机对我说：
  “看见吗？波兰人和中国人是很容易交上朋友的。要知道，中国和波兰在近代历史上都曾经是被压迫的民族啊！”老司机的话使我记起了鲁迅先生早年特别重视向中国读者介绍东欧各民族文学作品这件事。鲁迅先生有着这样的见解：因为同是被压迫民族（指解放前的中国和东欧各国民族），有着共同的感情和声音。我想，这该正是中波人民友谊的历史根源之一吧！
