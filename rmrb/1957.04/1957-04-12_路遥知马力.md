    “Distant Roads Test the Horse's Strength”
    Nan Shan
    Some creative friends have told me, with distress, that they have a lot they want to write, but certain leading comrades find all sorts of unreasonable excuses not to approve their creative leave, or don't provide any care for their lives, making it impossible for them to apply for creative leave. And other friends who have already been granted creative leave and are in the process of creating also tell me with distress that in a short period of three or four months, in addition to writing a novella or novel of one or two hundred thousand words, they must also write one or two short stories that are guaranteed to be published. Because behind them, there are many pairs of eyes staring intently: "We'll give you a few months to try, we don't believe you can come up with anything!"
    This reminds me of the situation when Balzac first stepped onto the difficult path of literature. It was one day in the spring of 1819, when this future great writer, who was only twenty years old, suddenly jumped up from the bench in the law firm, pushed aside the dusty files spread on the table, and announced to his money-loving parents: he would no longer be a lawyer but would become a writer! After many days of argument, his father, unable to persuade his son, had to draw up a strange contract with him, which, in our current terms, was to approve his creative leave. The term was two years; if after two years, he still could not become a famous writer, then the expenses that were barely enough to maintain his minimum standard of living would be revoked, and he would be called back to his bench in the law firm (see Stefan Zweig's "Balzac").
    So, in these two years, Balzac wrote like a madman, but in the end, he only wrote a failed play. But he did not go back to being a lawyer; he had to spare no effort to make money for his future great career.
    Think about it, even a genius like Balzac, if he did not have the objective conditions necessary for creation, if his creative leave had not been approved, then he would probably have died of old age on the bench in the law firm; and even if his creative leave was approved, he could not guarantee that he would be able to write successful works all at once. This is not surprising, because creation is, after all, an extremely complex mental labor. I remember a world-renowned old writer once said that after he had written novels for decades, every time he picked up his pen, he felt as difficult as he did when he first started writing decades ago, even more difficult.
    Then, why do the leading comrades of some of our units now want to imitate the practices of Balzac's parents, and even seem to be less "magnanimous" than them? Is it because the authors applying for creative leave are more "arrogant" than Balzac was back then? Is it worth giving "spiritual pressure" just because they can't write works that can be published within a few months? As far as I know, those friends who are applying for creative leave are indeed much more "sensible" than Balzac was back then; if they didn't have a considerable degree of certainty, they wouldn't dare to "take the risk"; and those friends who are currently on creative leave, their attitude toward labor is simply no less crazy than Balzac's was back then. If the works they write unfortunately fail, I think it is the beginning of success.
    However, how painful is this kind of approach, which forces people to seek quick success in an abnormal atmosphere, for serious authors who truly want to explore life and explore art! How much good does it do for the prosperity of literature? I think it is worth pondering.
    We have a very wise proverb in our country, called "Distant roads test the horse's strength." In order to make more and more steeds gallop on the Chinese literary scene, I think some leading comrades should broaden their minds and look further ahead, letting more horses, who are not yet known to be steeds, embark on their own paths; let them run more freely on the long journey. Don't say this is not allowed, that is not allowed; don't make them overly nervous! If there are indeed sufficient reasons not to let them run, then naturally it is better to postpone it temporarily.
    If some little donkeys pretending to be horses take the opportunity to wander around, that is easy to deal with, but this is not within the scope of this article.

    “路遥知马力”
    南山
    有些搞创作的朋友苦恼地告诉我，他们有许多东西要写，但某些领导同志却找出各种各样缺乏理由的理由不批准他们的创作假，或对他们的生活不加任何照顾，使他们无法申请创作假。而另外一些已蒙批准创作假正在创作的朋友也苦恼地告诉我，他们在短短的三、四个月里，除了要写一、二十万字的中篇或长篇之外，还必须写出一两个准能发表的短篇。因为在他们的背后，有好多双眼睛紧盯着：“给你几个月时间试试看，不信你就能拿出什么作品来！”
    这使我想起巴尔扎克第一天跨上艰难的文学道路的情形。那是1819年春天的某一天，这个还只有二十岁的未来的大文豪，突然从律师事务所的凳子上跳将起来，推开摊在桌子上的尘封的案卷，向他那爱财如命的父母宣布：他再也不当律师而要去当作家了！经过好多天的争论之后，无法说服儿子的父亲只好和他订立了一份奇怪的合同，用我们现在的话说，就是批准他的创作假了。期限是两年；如果两年期满，他还不能成为著名的作家，那就要撤销给他仅够维持最低生活水准的费用，叫他重新回到他那律师事务所的凳子上去（详见司蒂芬·支魏格作“巴尔扎克传”）。
    于是，在这两年中，巴尔扎克如疯如狂地写作了，但结果只写出了一个失败的剧本。不过他没有回去当律师；他不能不为自己未来伟大的事业费尽心机去挣钱了。
    想一想吧，即使像巴尔扎克这样的天才，如果没有创作所必需的客观条件，如果不批准他的创作假，那他大概也只好老死在律师事务所的凳子上；而就是批准他的创作假，他也不能保证一下子就写得出成功的作品。这并没有什么奇怪，因为创作毕竟是一种极其复杂的精神劳动。记得一位举世闻名的老作家曾经说过，当他写了几十年的小说之后，每次提笔还像几十年以前第一次提笔写作时一样感到困难，甚至感到更大的困难。
    那末，我们现在某些单位的领导同志为何还要仿效巴尔扎克父母的那种做法，而且在“器量”上还好像不及他们呢？是不是因为那些申请创作假的作者比当年的巴尔扎克还要“狂妄”？是不是因为在几个月之内写不出能够发表的作品就值得给予“精神压力”呢？据我所知，那些申请创作假的朋友的确比当年的巴尔扎克“识相”得多，要不是有相当的把握，他们是不敢“挺而走险”的；而那些正在度创作假的朋友，其劳动态度的如疯如狂简直不下于当年的巴尔扎克。如果他们写出来的作品不幸而失败了，我以为是成功的开始。
    可是，这种在不正常的气氛中不得不急于求成的做法，对于真想探索人生、探索艺术的严肃的作者是何等痛苦！对于繁荣文学到底有多少好处？我看是值得深思的。
    我国有一句非常明智的俗语，叫做“路遥知马力”。欲使中国文坛上驰骋着愈来愈多的千里马，我觉得某些领导同志应该放大胸怀，放远眼光，让更多的现在还不知道是不是千里马的马走上自己的道路；让他们更无拘无束地在长途上奔跑。不要这也不行，那也不行；不要把他们弄得过分的神经紧张！如果确有充分的理由不能让他们去奔跑，那自然也只好暂时缓一缓。
    如果有什么冒充马的小毛驴之类乘机出来游荡一下，那是容易对付的，但这不在本文所说的范围之内。
