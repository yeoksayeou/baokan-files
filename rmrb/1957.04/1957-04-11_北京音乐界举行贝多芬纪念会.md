Xinhua News Agency, April 10th: Beijing music circles held a memorial meeting tonight for the 130th anniversary of the death of German composer Beethoven.

The memorial meeting was presided over by Ma Sicong, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Musicians Association. He said that Beethoven created a valuable musical and artistic treasure for the people of the world. His works embody the democratic revolutionary spirit of the German and European people at that time. At the same time, his rich and diverse creations enriched the expressiveness of music, making music an art that expresses the deepest and most delicate human emotions.

Ma Sicong said that the Chinese people cherish Beethoven's immortal artistic creations, and Beethoven will always live in our hearts.

Professor Werner Goßling, a music conducting expert from the German Democratic Republic in Beijing, gave a report at the meeting entitled "Beethoven's Spirit Connects Progressive People All Over the World." He briefly introduced Beethoven's life experiences and artistic activities. He especially mentioned that when Beethoven was thirty-two years old, his ear disease would incurably deteriorate to the point of losing his hearing, which was the cruelest fate for a musician who lives by his ears. In 1812, he was almost forced to embark on the road of suicide. However, Beethoven's stronger will to live and create did not succumb to death, and then came the most brilliant masterpieces.

After the memorial meeting, a concert was held. The Central Philharmonic Orchestra performed Beethoven's famous work "Symphony No. 5 in C Minor (Fate)," conducted by Werner Goßling himself. Pianist Zhou Guangren played Beethoven's piano piece "Sonata Op. 110"; young violinist Peng Dingxin played Beethoven's violin piece "Romance in F Major."

More than 1,000 people from music circles and literary and art circles attended tonight's memorial meeting.

The Ambassador of the German Democratic Republic to China, Gipner, and his wife also attended the memorial meeting.

    北京音乐界举行贝多芬纪念会
    据新华社10日讯　中国音乐家协会今晚在北京举行德国作曲家贝多芬逝世一百三十周年纪念会。
    纪念会由中国音乐家协会副主席马思聪主持。他说，贝多芬为全世界人民创造了宝贵的音乐艺术财富，在他的作品中体现了当时德国人民和欧洲人民的民主革命精神，同时以他丰富多采的创作丰富了音乐的表现力，使音乐成为表达人类心灵最深刻最细致的艺术。
    马思聪说，中国人民珍视贝多芬的不朽的艺术创造，贝多芬将永远活在我们心中。
    在北京的德意志民主共和国音乐指挥专家维尔纳·戈斯林教授在会上作了题为“贝多芬的精神把全世界的进步人民连结在一起”的报告。他扼要地介绍了贝多芬的一生经历和艺术活动。他特别讲到，贝多芬三十二岁时，他的耳疾将不可救药地恶化到丧失听觉，这对一个用耳朵生活的音乐家来讲是最残酷的命运。1812年几乎迫使他踏上了自杀的绝路。但贝多芬更强烈的生活与创作的意志并不向死亡屈服，于是接连出现了最辉煌的巨作。
    纪念会后，举行了音乐会。中央乐团交响乐队演奏了贝多芬的名作“C小调第五（命运）交响曲”，由维尔纳·戈斯林亲自指挥。钢琴家周广仁演奏了贝多芬的钢琴曲“奏鸣曲作品第一一○号”；青年小提琴家彭鼎新演奏了贝多芬的小提琴曲“F大调罗曼斯”。
    参加今晚纪念会的有音乐界、文艺界人士一千多人。
    德意志民主共和国驻华大使纪普纳和他的夫人也参加了纪念会。
