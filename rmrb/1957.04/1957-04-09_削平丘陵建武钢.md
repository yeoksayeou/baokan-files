    In the southeast corner of Wuhan, a city that stands majestically across the Yangtze River, tens of thousands of construction workers from all over the country are working day and night to complete the construction of a great project. The roar of various machines and the sounds of labor combine here into a magnificent chorus: the natural appearance of the wilderness is changing rapidly. This area is the construction area of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Joint Enterprise, which concerns the people of the whole country.

    In early April, we made a tour of this vast construction area.

    Our visit began with a tour of the Wuhan Thermal Power Plant. The thermal power plant is the hub that supplies power to Wuhan Steel, and it is located in the heart of the Wuhan Steel plant area. This is a large-scale thermal power plant with high temperature and high pressure. Its main plant building is currently the tallest plant building in Wuhan. Its 100-meter-high chimney resembles a pillar propping up the sky, and ordinary people will feel dizzy when they look up at it. At present, the installation project of this plant is nearing completion, and it will soon be able to start supplying power for the large-scale construction of Wuhan Steel.

    Standing on the high-rise building of this factory, we overlooked the entire Wuhan Steel construction site. From south to north, from east to west, the entire construction area spans more than 30 square kilometers, and construction machinery, working crowds, and newly built factories, office buildings, warehouses, residences, canteens, hospitals, schools, clubs, cinemas, shops, and other various buildings can be seen everywhere. The newly built highways and railways have crisscrossed and connected the Wuhan Steel construction site with Wuhan, the Yangtze River port, and the railway trunk lines; a huge power grid and water supply and drainage network have been laid from the air to the ground.

    How quickly everything has changed! A year and a half ago, when we first visited here, it was still a desolate suburb with rolling hills, and only a thousand farmers lived scattered within dozens of miles. At that time, all that could be seen here were a small number of geological surveying and drilling personnel, who were called sentinels for the construction of Wuhan Steel, and farmers sparsely cultivating in the fields. But now, everything has changed beyond recognition. The rolling hills have receded, and the entire Wuhan Steel construction area and its surroundings have developed into a noisy new town with a population of nearly 100,000.

    We then visited the Wuhan Steel construction base and the Wuhan Steel auxiliary repair facility area. The construction base is composed of more than a dozen factories, and its task is to create conditions for the mechanization and factory construction of Wuhan Steel's construction projects. Among these dozen factories, including concrete mixing plants, concrete prefabrication plants, and steel bar processing plants, have been completed and put into production one after another last year. Now, a large amount of concrete, various prefabricated components, and repaired construction machinery are transported from here to various construction sites every day. The auxiliary repair facility area includes various repair workshops, warehouses, and other auxiliary facilities, with a total of more than 40 construction projects, some of which have been basically completed, and some of which are still under construction or are about to start construction. This area is to serve the production of Wuhan Steel. Their scale is quite large, and the technology is also very advanced. Take the concrete mixing plant of the construction base as an example, the concrete mixed by this plant every year is almost equal to all the concrete needed to build the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge.

    The construction area of the iron and steel joint enterprise left the deepest impression on us. In the coking chemical plant, ironmaking plant, and sintering plant areas, groups of excavators are digging hills, and tractors are pulling scrapers to smooth the ruggedness of the earth, with the momentum of overturning mountains and seas. Dump trucks come and go one after another, which can be described as "cars like flowing water, horses like dragons." On the roads running through several plant areas, dust is billowing everywhere, and the car groups seem to be traveling in a thick fog. In the refractory material plant area, the builders have ended the battle of leveling the plant base and have begun formal construction. Here, rows of construction scaffolding have been erected, some projects are excavating foundation earthwork, and some have begun to pour foundation concrete.

    In the coking chemical plant area, which is about to be constructed on a large scale, we met Huang Maoxing, an engineer from the Second Engineering Company of Wuhan Metallurgical Construction Corporation. This engineering company is responsible for the construction of the coking chemical plant's plant buildings. After Engineer Huang introduced the project arrangement to us, he said: "All the employees of our company are determined to build the coking chemical plant well. Compared with the start of the thermal power plant, our confidence this time is much greater."

    The Second Engineering Company has just built the thermal power plant and transferred to the coking chemical plant area. Before that, it was a civil construction engineering company with low technical and management levels. Therefore, at the beginning of the construction of the thermal power plant project, the employees did not have much confidence. They faced many difficulties. For example, the amount of concrete work in the thermal power plant project was very large, but at that time, there was not a single concrete worker in the entire company who could use a vibrator; the plant buildings of the thermal power plant were very high, but at that time, the scaffolders in the company did not dare to work at such high altitudes; many workers had never used, or even seen, many of the various machines used in construction. However, those days passed quickly. Tenacious learning enabled people to gradually but very quickly learn things they didn't know. A large number of skilled technical management talents grew up in actual work. Like Zhang Jingzhi, the deputy manager of this company, whom we visited not long ago, is one of the management cadres who has grown up rapidly. This person, who has been working in the countryside for a long time and has a low level of education, did not even understand some common industrial construction terms two or three years ago. However, after training at the Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Site and on the Thermal Power Plant construction site, he has now become a construction deputy manager who is fully capable of his business. He can explain the problems in the project to the employees in an orderly manner and has learned the complete set of construction management art. Now, the entire Second Engineering Company has become an industrial construction team with a considerable technical level.

    At the refractory material plant construction site, we came into contact with the good atmosphere of builders attaching importance to quality and saving. A warehouse project on this construction site has been started for more than half a month. The time is not long, but during this period, on the basis of ensuring quality, people have made full use of substitutes and have saved more than 30,000 yuan of wealth, which is equivalent to half of the annual savings target. We talked with Ma Yujue, the party branch secretary of this construction site. Next to the rapidly rotating belt conveyor, in the sound of pouring concrete, Ma Yujue introduced us to the advanced Xu Hanzhang concrete group and other workers on the construction site. He said: "Before entering the construction site, each concrete group specially trained three or four vibrator hands, studied the quality regulations, and the construction site also conducted serious technical explanations to all workers." Similarly, when we visited Wuhan Steel, the builders we encountered, whether they were the bricklayers of the nationally famous Su Changyou group and the plasterers of the Yang Dezhong group, or ordinary construction workers, excavator operators, and drivers, all held the same attitude towards the construction of Wuhan Steel as the builders of the refractory material plant.

    We ended our visit to the Wuhan Steel construction area at night. At that time, the outside of the Wuhan Steel construction site had gradually become quiet. But in the construction area, on each construction site, the machinery was still roaring, the lights were everywhere, and the labor was as boiling as in the daytime.

    削平丘陵建武钢
    新华社记者　方堤　冯健
    在横跨长江巍然屹立的武汉市的东南角上，几万名来自全国各地的建筑职工，正在为完成一个伟大工程的建设，夜以继日地紧张地劳动。各种机械的轰鸣和劳动的声音，在这里汇合成了雄浑的大合唱：原野的自然面貌在飞速地变化着。这一带，就是全国人民关心的武汉钢铁联合企业建筑区。
    4月上旬，我们在这个辽阔的建筑区内作了巡行访问。
    我们的访问从参观武汉热电厂开始。热电厂是供应武钢动力的枢纽，它正处在武钢厂区的心脏地带。这是一个高温高压的，大型热电厂，它的主体厂房，是目前武汉市区最高的厂房建筑物。它那高一百公尺的烟囱，俨然像一根擎天大柱，普通人仰头看去，就会感到头晕目眩。目前，这个厂的安装工程已经接近完成，不久后，就可以开始为武钢的大规模施工送电了。
    站在这个工厂的高层建筑物上，我们俯瞰了武钢工地的全貌。从南到北，从东到西，整个建筑区纵横三十多平方公里，处处都可以看到施工的机械，劳动着的人群，还有新建起来的厂房、办公楼、仓库、住宅、食堂、医院、学校、俱乐部、电影院、商店等各式各样的建筑物。新建的公路和铁路线，已经纵横交错地把武钢工地和武汉市区、长江港口、铁路干线贯通起来；从高空到地面，已经铺设起庞大的输电网和供排水网。
    一切变化得多么快！一年半以前，在我们第一次到这里访问的时候，这里还是一片丘陵起伏的荒郊，方圆几十里内只不过散居着千来户农民。那时，这里能够看到的只是为数不多的被称为是建设武钢的哨兵的地质测量和钻探人员，以及疏疏落落地在田间耕作的农民。可是现在，一切都变得使人辨认不出了。连绵起伏的丘陵退去了，整个武钢建筑区和它的周围，已发展成为拥有近十万人口的喧闹的新镇了。
    我们接着访问了武钢的建筑基地和武钢的辅助修理设施区。建筑基地是由十多个工厂组成的，它的任务是为武钢建设工程的机械化和工厂化施工创造条件。这十多个工厂中，包括有混凝土搅拌厂、混凝土预制品厂和钢筋加工厂等，都已在去年先后建成投入生产。现在，每天都有大量混凝土，各种预制构件和修理好的施工机械，从这里运到各个施工现场去。辅助修理设施区，包括各种修理车间、仓库和其他附属设施，共有四十多项建筑工程，有的已经基本建成，有的还在继续施工或将要动工。这个区域是为武钢生产服务的。它们的规模相当大，而且技术也很先进。拿建筑基地的混凝土搅拌厂来说，这个厂每年搅拌出的混凝土，差不多等于建筑武汉长江大桥所需要的全部混凝土。
    钢铁联合企业的施工区，给我们留下的印象最深。在炼焦化工厂、炼铁厂和烧结厂区，成群结队的挖土机在挖丘陵，拖拉机曳引着铲运机在梳理着大地的崎岖，势如排山倒海。自卸汽车一辆接一辆地来往奔驰，真算得是“车如流水马如龙”。在贯穿几个厂区的公路上，到处尘头滚滚，车群好像是行进在大雾之中。而在耐火材料厂区内，建设者已经结束了平整厂基的战斗，开始正式施工。这里，已经矗立起成排的建筑架，有的工程在挖掘基础土方，有的已开始浇灌基础混凝土。
    在即将大规模施工的炼焦化工厂区，我们碰到了武汉冶金建筑总公司第二工程公司的黄懋兴工程师。这个工程公司负责炼焦化工厂的厂房建筑。黄工程师向我们介绍了工程安排情况后说：“我们全公司的职工都决心要把炼焦化工厂建设好。和热电厂开工时比起来，我们这次的信心大得多了。”
    第二工程公司是刚刚建设过热电厂而转移到炼焦化工厂区来的。在此以前，它是一个民用建筑工程公司，技术水平和管理水平都不高。因此，在热电厂工程开工建设的初期，职工的信心不大。他们存在着许许多多的困难。例如，热电厂工程的混凝土工作量是很大的，可是，全公司当时没有一个能够使用震动器的混凝土工；热电厂的厂房很高，而当时公司里的架子工却不敢到那样的高空去工作；施工中名目繁多的机具，许多工人有些不但没有用过，甚至连看也没有看过。不过，那样的日子很快就过去了。顽强的学习，使人们逐步地但是十分迅速地把不会的事情学会。大批熟练的技术管理人材在实际工作中成长了起来。像我们在不久前访问过的、这个公司的副经理张景智，就是迅速成长起来的管理干部中的一个。这个长期在农村里工作的文化水平并不高的人，两三年前连一些普通的工业建筑上惯用名词也不懂。可是经过在鞍钢建设工地的实习和热电厂工地上的锻炼，他现在已经成为完全能够胜任自己业务的施工副经理了。他能够井井有条地向职工讲解工程中的问题，学会了施工管理的成套艺术。现在，整个第二工程公司已经成为具有相当技术水平的工业建设队伍了。
    在耐火材料厂工地，我们接触到了建设者们重视质量和节约的好风气。这个工地的一个仓库工程开工半个多月了。时间不算长，但是，人们在这个时期内，在保证质量的基础上，充分利用代用品，已经节约了三万多元的财富，相当于全年节约指标的一半。我们同这个工地的党总支书记马玉珏交谈。在飞速转动着的皮带运输机旁，在倾注混凝土的声响中，马玉珏把工地上先进的徐汉章混凝土小组和其他工人介绍给我们。他说：“在进入工地以前，每个混凝土小组都特地训练了三、四名震动器手，都学习了质量规程，工地上也都对全体工人认真进行了技术交底。同样，我们在武钢工地访问时所遇到的建筑者们，不论他们是全国著名的苏长有小组的砌砖工人和杨德重小组的抹灰工人，或者是普通的建筑工人、挖土机手、司机，对于武钢的建设，都怀抱着和耐火材料厂建设者们同样的心情。
    我们在夜晚的时候结束对武钢建筑区的访问。那时，武钢工地外面已经渐渐地安静下来。但是在建筑区内各个工地上，却仍然是机械轰响，处处灯火，劳动像白昼一样地沸腾着。
