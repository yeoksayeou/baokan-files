Cotton Producing Area Farmers Actively Planting While Soil is Moist

    (This newspaper) News dispatch: The national total output of ginned cotton is initially planned to reach 33 million dan this year, which is higher than any previous year (including the bumper harvest of 1955). In order to achieve this goal, farmers in cotton-producing areas such as Hebei, Jiangsu, Shanxi, and Shaanxi are planting cotton while the soil is moist.

    Hebei
    Hebei Province, which accounts for the largest share of the country's cotton production, has been expanding its cotton field area year by year since liberation. This year, some cotton fields that are not suitable for cotton cultivation have been converted to planting early-maturing, flood-resistant, and high-yield crops. Therefore, the province's cotton field area has been reduced by more than 3 million mu compared to last year. However, Hebei Province's cotton planting area is still 15 million mu, and the total cotton output will still exceed any previous year except for 1955.

    Jiangsu
    Under the premise of ensuring the completion of the national cotton planting area, Jiangsu Province has appropriately reduced the cotton planting area in some old cotton areas that are prone to waterlogging and have low yields this year, and expanded the cotton planting area in some new cotton areas that are suitable for cotton cultivation. In order to improve the quality of cotton planting and strive for a bumper cotton harvest, the province has also transferred more than 100 skilled cotton growers from old areas to new cotton areas to teach planting techniques.

    Shanxi
    More than 5.5 million mu of cotton fields in Shanxi Province are being planted in a tense atmosphere. As of April 14th, Jinan Special District of this province had planted more than 2 million mu of cotton fields. The six agricultural cooperatives of Hongxing, Hongguang, Tuanjie, Fenghuo, and Shuguang in Linfen County planted more than 20,000 mu of cotton fields in two days, reaching more than 40% of the cotton field acreage.

    Shaanxi
    Shaanxi is taking advantage of the saturated soil after rain to plant cotton in a tense atmosphere. Yangxian, Ankang, Xunyang and other counties in southern Shaanxi started planting cotton fields from April 1st, and will soon be completed. Most areas of Guanzhong started planting on April 5th, and by the 16th, about 80% of the cotton fields had been sown. Cotton planting preparations are underway in northern Shaanxi, and counties south of Yan'an will be able to start planting in a few days.

    The main problems in cotton planting at present are: many areas lack animal power, general agricultural cooperatives lack reserve cotton seeds, and in some places the cotton planting area has not yet been determined. The province's agricultural production leading departments have once again instructed cotton-producing areas to seize the time to solve these problems.

    Xinjiang
    The agricultural production and construction troops in the famous high-yield cotton area, the Manas River Basin Reclamation Area in Xinjiang, have completed all preparations before cotton planting. Now, the officers and soldiers are only waiting for the ground temperature to rise to 12 degrees Celsius, and more than 100 tractors will be dispatched to plant.

    This year, the cotton fields in this reclamation area are about 60,000 mu larger than last year. The goal of the officers and soldiers this year is to strive for a total cotton output of 100 million jin, an increase of about 100% compared to last year's actual output. The Xue Zhanchun team, which created the national record for the highest cotton yield per mu of 1,686 jin, four liang and a half last year, is determined to break last year's record this year, and plans to achieve an average yield of 800 jin of cotton per mu in 75 mu of cotton fields; among which there are 10 mu of high-yield land, planned to produce 2,000 jin per mu.

### 棉产区农民积极趁墒播种

    棉产区农民积极趁墒播种
    本报讯　今年，全国皮棉总产量初步计划达到三千三百万担，比过去任何一年（包括丰收的1955年）都有提高。为了实现这个要求，河北、江苏、山西、陕西等棉产区的农民，正在趁墒播种棉花。
    河北
    棉花产量占全国第一位的河北省，解放后棉田面积逐年扩大，今年把一部分不适宜于植棉的棉田改种早熟、耐涝和高产作物，因此全省的棉田面积比去年减少三百多万亩。但是河北省棉花播种面积仍有一千五百万亩，棉花总产量仍将超过除1955年以外的以往任何一年。
    江苏
    江苏省在保证完成国家植棉面积的前提下，今年适当地缩小了部分容易受涝、产量不高的老棉区的棉花播种面积，扩大了一些宜于植棉的新棉区的棉花播种面积。为了提高棉花播种质量、争取棉花丰收，这个省还从老区抽调了一百多名植棉能手到新棉区去传授播种技术。
    山西
    山西省的五百五十多万亩棉田，正在紧张播种。这个省的晋南专区，截至14日，全区已播种棉田二百余万亩。临汾县的红星、虹光、团结、峰火、曙光等六个农业社，在两天里就播种棉田两万余亩，达到棉田亩数的40％以上。
    陕西
    陕西各地正趁雨后墒饱，紧张播种棉花。陕南洋县、安康、洵阳等县空茬棉田，从4月1日开始播种，最近即可播种完毕。关中大部地区从4月5日开始播种，到16日为止，80％左右的棉田已经下种。陕北植棉准备工作正在进行，延安以南各县再过几天就可以开始播种了。
    目前棉花播种中的主要问题是：很多地区畜力不足，一般农业社缺乏后备棉籽，而有些地方棉花播种面积至今还没有肯定下来。这个省的农业生产领导部门已再次指示棉产区各地抓紧解决。
    新疆
    著名的棉花丰产区——新疆玛纳斯河流域垦区的农业生产建设部队，已经完成了植棉前的全部准备工作。现在官兵们只待地温上升到十二度后，一百多台拖拉机便将出动播种。
    今年，这个垦区的棉田约比去年扩大六万多亩。官兵们今年的目标是，争取棉花总产量达到一亿斤，比去年实际产量约增加一倍。去年创造棉花单产全国最高纪录一千六百八十六斤四两半的薛占春小组，今年决心打破去年的纪录，计划在七十五亩棉田中达到每亩平均产棉八百斤；其中有十亩高产地，计划每亩产到二千斤。（附图片）
