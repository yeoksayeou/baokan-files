　　Another Failure of British Colonial Suppression Policies

　　On March 9th of last year, the British government arrested Archbishop Makarios, the leader of the Cypriot people's movement for national self-determination, and exiled him to the Seychelles Islands because he rejected the British "autonomous constitution" deception and insisted on the right to national self-determination. Just over a year later, on March 28th of this year, the British government announced the release of Archbishop Makarios. What are the reasons that led the British government to change its decision? What does this change indicate?

　　This new decision proves that the British government has finally had to admit that the colonial suppression policy pursued in Cyprus so far has failed. When Archbishop Makarios was arrested and exiled last year, the British government was still aggressively dispatching troops, organizing sweeps in Cyprus, and arresting people on a large scale, and using hanging to intimidate Cypriots fighting for national self-determination. After the failure of the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt, the British government concentrated more troops in Cyprus, attempting to "suppress the rebellion" in one fell swoop. However, the Cypriot people not only did not lay down their arms because of brutal suppression, but also launched a broader struggle under the slogan of fighting for the release of Archbishop Makarios, making the British colonial army exhausted.

　　At the same time, the Cypriot people's struggle has also gained increasingly broad sympathy and support internationally. In the United Kingdom, more and more people oppose the British government's colonial suppression policies. In February of this year, the United Nations General Assembly discussed the Cyprus issue. Despite the many efforts of colonialist forces to prevent the assembly from making resolutions unfavorable to colonialism, the assembly still passed a resolution calling for a peaceful, democratic, and just solution to the Cyprus issue in accordance with the spirit of the United Nations Charter. According to the spirit of the United Nations Charter, such a solution can only be to first recognize and respect the Cypriot people's right to national self-determination. Compelled by this situation, the British government had to consider revising its strategy and proposed a plan to release Archbishop Makarios.

　　Although Archbishop Makarios has now been released from the Seychelles Islands, he has not ended his life in exile, because the British colonialists do not allow him to return to his homeland and people. At the same time, the British colonial authorities in Cyprus are also unwilling to end the military state of emergency. This shows that the British government has not yet abandoned its policy of colonial rule over Cyprus. Therefore, Archbishop Makarios rightly pointed out in his statement that there can be no talk of resuming negotiations while the British colonial authorities continue to detain thousands of Cypriot political prisoners; he is not prepared to negotiate until he is allowed to return to Cyprus.

　　While celebrating their victory in securing the release of Archbishop Makarios, the Cypriot people have not forgotten that the national task of fighting for Cypriot self-determination still awaits them to complete. Archbishop Makarios said very clearly: "For the Cypriot people, a democratic and just solution can only mean the implementation of self-determination, and we will never stop until we achieve this ultimate goal." For the British government, it should learn a lesson from its failure and recognize that the struggle for the right to national self-determination cannot be suppressed. Only direct negotiations with the Cypriot people based on respect for their right to self-determination is the only realistic solution. Otherwise, the Cypriot people, who have experience in protracted struggle, will know how to continue their struggle in an effective way to achieve their ultimate goal.

### 英国殖民镇压政策的又一失败

    英国殖民镇压政策的又一失败
    去年3月9日，英国政府逮捕了塞浦路斯人民争取民族自决运动的领袖马卡里奥斯大主教，并把他流放到塞舌耳岛上，因为他拒绝英国“自治宪法”的骗局，而坚持民族自决的权利。仅仅经过了一年多，英国政府在今年3月28日又宣布释放马卡里奥斯大主教。是什么原因使得英国政府要改变它的决定呢？这种改变又说明什么问题呢？
    这个新决定证明，英国政府终于不得不承认，在塞浦路斯迄今推行的殖民镇压政策是失败了。当去年逮捕和放逐马卡里奥斯大主教时，英国政府还气势汹汹地调兵遣将，在塞浦路斯组织扫荡并大肆捕人，并且用绞刑恫吓塞浦路斯为民族自决而斗争的志士。在英法侵略埃及失败以后，英国政府在塞浦路斯集中了更多军队，企图一举“戡平叛乱”。但是塞浦路斯人民不但没有因为受到残暴的镇压而放下武器，反而在争取释放马卡里奥斯大主教的口号下展开了更广泛的斗争，使得英国殖民军疲于奔命。
    同时，塞浦路斯人民的斗争也取得了国际上日益广泛的同情和支持。在英国国内，就有愈来愈多的人反对英国政府的殖民镇压政策。今年2月间，联合国大会讨论塞浦路斯问题，尽管殖民主义势力作了许多努力来阻止大会作出不利于殖民主义的决议，大会还是通过了决议，要求就塞浦路斯问题求得符合于联合国宪章精神的和平民主和公正的解决。而按照联合国宪章的精神，这种解决只能是首先承认和尊重塞浦路斯人民的民族自决权利。迫于这种形势，英国政府不得不考虑修改它的策略，提出了释放马卡里奥斯大主教的计划。
    现在马卡里奥斯大主教虽然已从塞舌耳岛被释放出来，但是并没有结束被流放的生活，因为英国殖民主义者不许他回到他的乡土和人民中间去。同时，塞浦路斯英国殖民当局也还不愿意结束军事紧急状态。这说明英国政府仍没有放弃它对塞浦路斯的殖民统治政策。因此，马卡里奥斯大主教在他的声明中正当地指出，在英国殖民当局继续拘禁着成千的塞浦路斯政治犯时，谈不上恢复谈判；在他被允许回塞浦路斯以前，他不准备进行谈判。
    塞浦路斯人民在庆祝他们争取到马卡里奥斯大主教释放的胜利时，并没有忘记，争取塞浦路斯自决的民族任务仍等待着他们去完成。马卡里奥斯大主教说得很明白：“对于塞浦路斯人民来说，一种民主的和公正的解决只有意味着实行自决，而且，我们不达到这个最终目的决不休止。”对于英国政府来说，应该从失败中取得教训，认识争取民族自决权利的斗争是镇压不了的。只有在尊重塞浦路斯人民自决权利的基础上同塞浦路斯人民直接谈判，才是唯一现实的办法。否则，有长期斗争经验的塞浦路斯人民，会知道怎样以有效的方法来继续进行斗争，以达到他们的最终目的。
