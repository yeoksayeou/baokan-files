Xinhua News Agency, April 11th, Ottawa News: Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson stated in the House of Commons on the 10th that it is "intolerable and should not happen" for an agency of a foreign government to interfere in Canadian affairs and make things difficult for a Canadian citizen.

Pearson was talking about the incident where the US Senate Internal Security Subcommittee pressured Canadian Ambassador to Egypt, Norman, to his death. He said that Canada is fully capable of taking care of its own "security matters." "If we as a government have failed in our security responsibilities, we are responsible to our own people, not to any subcommittee of a foreign legislature."

Pearson said that unless the United States meets Canada's conditions, Canada is unwilling to provide confidential materials concerning Canadian citizens to the United States again. The conditions he put forward are: The United States must guarantee not to hand over such intelligence to any US government agency that is not supervised by the executive branch, and may not hand over such intelligence to any agency of the US government without the consent of the Canadian government.

Xinhua News Agency, April 11th: In recent days, some British and American newspapers have continued to publish commentaries condemning the US Congress for pressuring Canadian Ambassador to Egypt, Norman, to his death. The British "News Chronicle" wrote under the title "Slander Kills": It seems clear that Canadian Ambassador to Egypt, Norman, died as a result of the slanderous propaganda from Washington.

The American "New York Post" asked, why did the Eastland Committee choose Norman to persecute? It said that this is because the Eastland Committee has not had any information to persecute people for a long time. Those who have attracted people's attention by participating in the persecution activities of McCarthy, Jenner, and Eastland cannot but increasingly dig things up from the distant past in order to justify their own survival. News from all over the world shows that Norman's suicide has aroused anti-American sentiment. A wave of resentment swept through Canada, and the repercussions of this incident could also be heard in Japan.

    不能容忍外国政府干涉加拿大事务
    加外长抨击美国逼死诺曼
    英美报纸指责美国的卑鄙行为
    新华社11日讯　渥太华消息：加拿大外交部长皮尔逊10日在众议院发表声明说，由一个外国政府的机构来干涉加拿大的事务，作难一个加拿大的公民，这是“不可容忍的，而且不应该发生”。
    皮尔逊所谈的是美国参议院国内安全小组委员会逼死加拿大驻埃及大使诺曼的事件。他说，加拿大完全能够照管它自己的“安全事务”。“如果我们作为一个政府没有尽到我们的安全责任，我们应对我们自己的人民负责，而不是对任何外国立法机构的小组委员会负责。”
    皮尔逊说，除非美国满足加拿大的条件，否则加拿大不愿再把有关加拿大公民的机密材料提供给美国。他提出的条件是：美国必须保证不把这类情报交给不受行政部门监督的任何美国政府机构，同时在未获加拿大政府的同意以前，不得将这类情报交给美国政府的任何一个机构。
    据新华社11日讯　最近几天，英国和美国的一些报纸继续发表评论，指责美国国会逼死了加拿大驻埃及大使诺曼。英国“新闻纪事报”以“诽谤杀人”为题写道：看来清楚的是，加拿大驻埃及大使诺曼是由于华盛顿的诬蔑宣传而死的。
    美国“纽约邮报”问道，伊斯特兰委员会为什么要选中诺曼来进行迫害呢？它说，这是因为伊斯特兰委员会在很长时期来就没有迫害人的资料了。由于参加麦卡锡、真纳和伊斯特兰的迫害活动而引起人们注意的那批人，就不能不越来越向遥远的过去去挖掘东西以使他们自己有理由生存下去。全世界各地的消息都表明，诺曼的自杀激起了人们的反美情绪。愤懑的浪潮席卷了加拿大，在日本也可以听到这件事的反响。
