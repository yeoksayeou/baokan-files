    Some Agencies in Beijing and Other Places
    Violate State Council Regulations by Privately Recruiting Personnel
    Supervisory and Labor Departments Have Requested Leadership to Stop It
    (Our Newspaper) News: After the State Council issued the "Notice on Stopping the Increase of Institutions and Expansion of Staffing in State Organs" on November 16, 1956, some organs and enterprises are still privately recruiting personnel.
    After the State Council issued the notice, the Ministry of Forestry Industry sent two recruitment work groups to Wuhan, Guangzhou, Shanghai and other places on November 27 and 28, 1956 to recruit staff. A total of 41 people were recruited, including an elderly person who was 73 years old and a person suffering from mental illness. In Beijing, 14 units (4 units directly under the central government and 10 units under the city) privately recruited more than 200 people. The Industrial Cadre School affiliated to the First Ministry of Machinery Industry privately recruited 15 farmers in December last year. The Beijing Office of the Liujiaxia Hydropower Engineering Bureau Preparatory Office of the Hydropower General Bureau of the Ministry of Electric Power Industry privately recruited 31 technicians in December last year. The Glass Factory affiliated to the Second Local Industry Bureau of Beijing privately employed 7 cooks, nursery workers, and apprentices after December 6 last year without any approval procedures, and transferred 13 temporary workers to permanent workers. After hearing the Municipal People's Committee's decision on freezing staffing, the Dongjiao Livestock Farm of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Conservancy still requested the Bureau of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Conservancy to make 34 temporary workers permanent. Without the consent of the Bureau of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Conservancy, they took the liberty of completing the procedures for making them permanent. From November 7 last year to the end of February this year, more than a dozen units in the provincial-level organs of Fujian Province and in Fuzhou and Nanping cities privately recruited 62 cadres, 59 fixed workers, 18 probationary cadres who were made permanent, and 42 drivers who were made permanent, totaling 181 people.
    Judging from the personnel privately recruited by some units in Beijing, most of them are farmers from other places, generally engaged in manual labor and odd jobs; and these personnel can be solved through adjustment in Beijing's organs and enterprises.
    After discovering the above-mentioned situation of violating the State Council's instructions and privately recruiting personnel, the National Supervisory Authority and the labor department have reported to the State Council, the competent authorities, and the local People's Committees respectively. The Beijing Municipal People's Committee has circulated the investigation report of the Municipal Supervisory Bureau and the Labor Bureau, and ordered all units to conscientiously check the implementation of the State Council's instructions and strictly stop the phenomenon of privately recruiting personnel.

    北京等地有些机关
    违背国务院规定私自招收人员
    监察、劳动部门已提请领导机关制止
    本报讯　1956年11月16日国务院“关于国家机关停止增设机构扩大编制的通知”发出后，有些机关和企业仍在私自招收人员。
    森林工业部在国务院发出通知后，于1956年11月27、28两日派出两个招聘工作组赴武汉、广州、上海等地招收工作人员。共招收了四十一人，其中有年满七十三岁的老人，有患精神病的。北京市有十四个单位（中央机关所属单位四个，市属单位十个）私自招收人员二百余名。第一机械工业部所属工业干部学校在去年12月私自招收十五名农民。电力工业部水力发电总局所属兰州刘家峡水力发电工程局筹备处驻京办事处在去年12月份私自招收技术工人三十一名。北京市第二地方工业局所属玻璃厂在去年12月6日以后，未经任何批准手续，私自录用炊事员、保育员、学徒工七人，并把十三名临时工转为长期工。北京市农林水利局东郊牧畜场在听了市人民委员会关于冻结编制决定的传达后，仍然请示农林水利局将三十四名临时工转正，未得到农林水利局同意，就擅自办理了转正手续。福建省省级机关和福州、南平两市有十几个单位，从去年11月7日到今年2月底，私自招收干部六十二人，固定工人五十九人，试用干部转正十八人，培养驾驶员转正四十二人，共计一百八十一人。
    从北京市一些单位私自招收来的人员看，大部分是外地的农民，一般是从事体力劳动和作勤杂工的；而这些人员在北京市的机关、企业中是可以调剂解决的。
    国家监察机关和劳动部门在发现上述违反国务院指示、私自招收人员的情况后，已分别向国务院、主管部门和当地人民委员会作了报告。北京市人民委员会已经通报了市监察局和劳动局的调查报告，并责成各单位认真检查执行国务院指示的情况，严格制止私自招收人员的现象。　（监研）
