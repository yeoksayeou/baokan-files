    "Liu Xiang Jiu" Fresh Leaf Oil Production
    Only Guangdong Province in the whole country can grow "Liu Xiang Jiu". The fragrant oil made from the fresh leaves of this plant is a high-quality fragrance and an effective medicine for disinfection, sterilization, and treating external injuries.
    The formal name of "Liu Xiang Jiu" is Lemon Eucalyptus. The oil produced is called Lemon Eucalyptus Oil. This plant originated in the tropics and was later introduced for planting in the subtropics. Last year, the state-owned Xingxing Reclamation Farm planted 7,100 mu. This year, estimating 100 jin of fresh leaves per mu, it can produce 8,000 to 9,000 jin of Lemon Eucalyptus Oil, worth 80,000 to 90,000 yuan. Lemon Eucalyptus wood is also very valuable and lasts a long time when used for railway sleepers, bridges, etc.

    “留香久”鲜叶制油
    全国只有广东省才能种植“留香久”，用这种植物的鲜叶制出的香油，是上等的香料，又是消毒杀菌和医治外伤的有效药品。
    “留香久”正名是柠檬桉，制出的油叫柠檬桉油，这种植物原产于热带，后来被引进亚热带种植。国营星星垦殖农场去年种了七千一百亩，今年以每亩采鲜叶一百斤计，就可以蒸出柠檬桉油八、九千斤，价值八、九万元。柠檬桉木材也很名贵，用来做枕木桥梁等经久不坏。
