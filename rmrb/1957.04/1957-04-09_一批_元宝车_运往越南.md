Xinhua News Agency, Tangshan, April 6th: The first batch of heavy-duty, well-deck flatcars manufactured by the Tangshan Rolling Stock Repair Plant for the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, suitable for narrow-gauge railways, has begun to be shipped out successively. In addition, the design work for a batch of soft and hard berth sleeper cars and dining cars for the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has been completed, and trial production will begin soon.

This kind of well-deck flatcar looks very much like the Chinese "ingot" of the past, so it is also called "ingot car."

    一批“元宝车”运往越南
    据新华社唐山6日电　唐山机车车辆修理厂为越南民主共和国制造的第一批适合于窄轨行驶的载货重型凹底平车，开始陆续启运。另外，为越南民主共和国制造的一批软硬席寝车和餐车的设计工作已经完成，不久将开始试制。
    这种凹底平车很像中国过去的元宝，因此又叫“元宝车”。
