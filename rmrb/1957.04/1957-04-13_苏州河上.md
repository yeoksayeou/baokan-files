    On the Suzhou Creek
    —One of the drafts of Southern Travel Poems
    Ma Xun
    Ah, you, old and yet young boat on the Suzhou Creek,
    Carrying this family, how many springs have you lived through?
    In your dreams, you can distinguish the footsteps of these three generations,
    Those unforgettable years are engraved in your heart.
    The white-haired old man, how many risks has he shared with you?
    Now, happiness comes from all directions to visit his later years.
    The two grandsons wrestle and play, shaking your arms,
    The setting sun holds golden waves and cheers, even the chicks join in the shouts.
    The old lady returns, buying new cloth and new cotton for her children and grandchildren,
    The daughter-in-law starts the fire to cook, and wisps of smoke rise on the river,
    The son is at a meeting on the team leader's boat, coming back soon,
    The prospects of life he will tell are exciting.
    In the past, the shores and the river were like heaven and hell connected,
    Look at today, the brilliant October is full of joy everywhere,
    No wonder you, the old and young boat, stay awake late at night,
    Dreaming of tomorrow's journey, the east wind blows the white sails.
                          1957, 3 in Shenyang

    苏州河上
    ——南游诗草之一
    马寻你呀，苏州河上古老而又年青的船，载着这一家人，生活过多少春天？梦中，你也辨得出这祖孙三代的步声，那难忘的岁月啊，刻记在你的心坎。白发老翁，曾和你共度过多少风险？如今，幸福从四面八方来访晚年。两孙儿摔跤嬉戏，摇动你的双臂，夕阳捧金波喝采，鸡雏也助威呐喊。老太太归来，给儿孙买回新布新棉，媳妇升火烧饭，河上荡起缕缕炊烟，儿子在组长船上开会，快回来了，他将述说的生活远景啊，动人心弦。过去的岸上河下，天堂地狱两相连，看今天，灿烂的十月到处都是腾欢，难怪你古老而年青的船啊，深宵不寐，梦明朝行程，东风吹起洁白的轻帆。
