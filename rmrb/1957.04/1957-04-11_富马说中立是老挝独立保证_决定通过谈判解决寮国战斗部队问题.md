Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 10th -- Vientiane dispatch: Lao Prime Minister Prince Souvanna Phouma said in a radio broadcast on April 9th: "Neutrality is the most reliable guarantee of Lao independence. Laos intends to maintain neutrality based on the principles of peaceful coexistence."

In his speech, Phouma summarized the government's work over the past year. He said that his program was originally focused on resolving two issues: the Lao Fighting Forces issue and the implementation of a neutral foreign policy.

Regarding the issue of the Lao Fighting Forces, Phouma said that there were originally two methods to solve it: through negotiations or through fighting. He said: "The Royal Government adopted the former method." Prince Phouma also explained: "Because the Royal Government believes that it cannot allow things to remain in the state they were after the Geneva Conference, nor can it plunge into a civil war."

Then, Phouma said to the opposition: "Regardless of what some opposition parties think or lead people to think, the negotiations that have already begun are still ongoing." Phouma said that these opposition parties are attempting to seek a solution to the current difficulties by simply abandoning the two provinces or by waging a heinous civil war throughout the country.

Phouma believes that the difficulties have increased because some leaders of the Lao Fighting Forces are attempting to steer national policy in a direction that the government cannot follow.

Phouma said, "In terms of foreign policy, it would be foolish to request assistance from another major power bloc before our internal affairs are resolved and before the Lao Fighting Forces have given a definite guarantee of loyalty."

    富马说中立是老挝独立保证
    决定通过谈判解决寮国战斗部队问题
    新华社河内10日电　万象消息：老挝首相富马亲王4月9日在广播中说：“中立是老挝独立的最可靠的保证。老挝打算依据和平共处原则保持中立。”
    富马在演说中总结了政府一年来的工作。他说，他的纲领原来就是集中解决两个问题：寮国战斗部队问题和实行中立的对外政策问题。
    富马说，关于寮国战斗部队的问题，本来可以用两种方法来解决：通过谈判或者通过战斗。他说：“王国政府采取了前一个方法。”富马亲王并且解释说：“因为王国政府认为既不能让事情停留在日内瓦会议之后的状态中，也不能投入一个内战。”
    接着富马对反对派说：“不管某些反对派认为怎样或者使人认为怎样，已经开始的谈判仍在进行。”富马说，这些反对派企图寻求一个干脆放弃两个省、或者在全国进行罪恶的内战的办法来解决目前的困难。
    富马认为，由于寮国战斗部队的一些领导人企图把国家政策引向政府所不能追随的方向，因而增加了困难。
    富马说，“在对外政策方面，在我们的内政问题没有解决之前和寮国战斗部队没有确切保证忠诚之前，向另一个强国集团要求援助将是愚蠢的。”
