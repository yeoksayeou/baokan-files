    Mancheng County Party Committee Holds Special Meeting
    to Solve Problems of Transferred Cadres
    (Our Dispatch) The Mancheng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hebei Province recently held a special meeting for transferred cadres to study and resolve several issues in their work.
    In order to strengthen the leading backbone at the township level, the Mancheng County Committee transferred sixty-two cadres from county-level organs to work in the townships in three batches, including nine members of the County Committee. After the first two batches of cadres went to the countryside, their duties were not clear, which caused a lot of inconvenience in their work. At the same time, the township-level leading backbone still felt insufficient. Therefore, the County Committee continued to transfer leading backbone cadres to the countryside, uniformly arranged the positions of the three batches of transferred cadres, and held meetings to extensively solicit the opinions of the transferred cadres to discuss and resolve related issues.
    After discussion, everyone affirmed the great significance of strengthening and improving grassroots leadership and the work achievements of the transferred cadres in the previous period. At the same time, they raised some problems caused by the unclear duties. The transferred cadres generally had a higher level, and some of the original township cadres had varying degrees of dependency. The transferred cadres also felt embarrassed, feeling that neither being too forward nor too backward was good. They were afraid that taking over everything would affect the enthusiasm of the original township cadres, and they were also afraid of failing to live up to the organization's expectations if they did not do their job well. Because the original positions of the transferred cadres had not been removed, the township cadres still called them ministers, directors, section chiefs, etc., treating them as leading cadres sent by the county to lead them. Therefore, some township cadres did not dare to boldly put forward their opinions. During meetings, they mostly focused on listening to the opinions of the transferred cadres. Some townships even violated the principle of collective leadership and failed to hold meetings according to the system, handling matters after a few people discussed them.
    After the issue was raised, the County Committee determined the positions of each transferred cadre. Among the sixty-two people, thirty were appointed as the first secretary of the township party committee or the secretary of the district committee, two were appointed as deputy secretaries, and the rest mostly did work in the township people's committees and the political work of agricultural cooperatives. Now, the transferred cadres under the management of the County Committee have been appointed and dismissed. For cadres under the management of the Prefectural Committee, the County Committee will appoint them first and then ask the Prefectural Committee for dismissal. After the positions were determined, everyone was very happy, studied working methods, and were determined to do a good job in grassroots work and strive for a bumper harvest this year.

    满城县委召开专门会议
    解决下放干部工作中的问题
    本报讯　中共河北省满城县委最近召开了下放干部的专门会议，研究解决了下放干部工作中的若干问题。
    为了充实乡级领导骨干，满城县委曾三次从县级机关抽调六十二名干部到乡工作，其中有县委委员九人。前两批干部下乡后，因为职务不明确，工作起来有很多不方便，同时，乡级领导骨干仍感不足。为此，县委继续抽调领导骨干下乡，统一安排三批下放干部的职务，同时召开会议广泛地征求下放干部的意见，讨论和解决有关问题。
    经过讨论，大家肯定了加强和改进基层领导的重大意义和前一段下放干部的工作成绩，同时提出了因为职务不明确带来的一些问题。下派的干部一般水平较高，原来的乡干部有些就有程度不同的依赖思想。下放干部也感到为难，觉得靠前靠后都不是，既怕包办代替影响了原来乡干部的积极性，又怕做不好工作辜负了组织上对自己的希望。因为下放干部原来的职务都没有免去，乡干部们就还叫他们为部长、主任、科长等等，把他们当做县里派来领导他们的领导干部，因而，有些乡干部不敢大胆提出意见，开会的时候大都是偏重听取下放干部的意见，有的乡甚至违背了集体领导的原则，不能按制度开会，有事情几个人一商量就办。
    问题提出以后，县委会确定了每个下放干部的职务。在六十二人中，任乡党委会第一书记或区委书记的有三十人，任副书记的有二人，另外的同志大部分做乡人民委员会的工作和农业社的政治工作。现在，被抽调的干部属县委管理的，都做了任职和免职，属地委管理的干部，县委先任职后，再请示地委免职。确定职务后，大家都很愉快，研究了工作方法，决心搞好基层工作，争取今年的大丰收。
