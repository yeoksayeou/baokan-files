Xinhua News Agency, 6th – The All-China Sports Federation announced today that the Chinese national football team has been formed to participate in the 1958 World Football Championship preliminary round. The football team consists of sixteen athletes, most of whom are players from the first team of the All-China Football League's top-tier league. Their average age is twenty-four years old.

According to the person in charge of the All-China Sports Federation, in selecting the members of the Chinese national football team, they not only observed the performances of various top-tier football teams in recent matches, but also took into account their performances in past competitions.

After participating in the first match of the second stage of the first round of the National Football League's top-tier league in the Beijing and Tianjin competition zones on April 7, the Chinese national football team will leave Beijing for Guangzhou to prepare for the first preliminary match against the Indonesian national football team in Jakarta on May 12.

The second preliminary match between the Chinese national football team and the Indonesian national football team is scheduled to be held in Beijing on June 2 this year.

The 1958 World Football Championship (the sixth edition) is scheduled to be held in Sweden in the summer of 1958. Due to the large number of participating teams, it has been decided to hold regional preliminary rounds in advance. The champion team in each regional preliminary round will be eligible to participate in next year's finals.

A total of eight teams are participating in the Asian-African preliminary round. The draw results are as follows: China vs. Indonesia, Turkey vs. Israel, Egypt vs. Cyprus, Sudan vs. Syria. Since the preliminary round adopts a single-elimination format, the winner of the China-Indonesia group will later compete with the winner of the Turkey-Israel group to produce a champion team for the zone; the winner of the Egypt-Cyprus group will compete with the winner of the Sudan-Syria group to produce another champion team for the zone. The Asian-African preliminary round is scheduled to conclude before the end of this year.

    参加世界足球锦标赛预选赛
    我国国家足球队组成
    下月同印度尼西亚队举行第一场比赛
    新华社6日讯　中华全国体育总会今天宣布：参加1958年世界足球锦标赛预选赛的中国国家足球队已经组成。足球队中共有十六名运动员，其中大部分都是参加1957年全国足球甲级队联赛的联队第一队的队员。他们的平均年龄是二十四岁。
    据中华全国体育总会的负责人说，在挑选中国国家足球队的队员时，他们不仅观察了各个甲级足球队在最近的一些比赛中的表现，同时也考虑到他们在过去比赛中的表现。
    中国国家足球队的队员4月7日在参加了全国足球甲级队联赛第一循环第二阶段北京、天津竞赛区的第一次比赛以后，即将离开北京去广州，准备到印度尼西亚去参加5月12日在雅加达同印度尼西亚国家足球队举行的第一场预选赛。
    中国国家足球队同印度尼西亚国家足球队之间的第二场预选赛，预定今年6月2日在北京举行。
    1958年世界足球锦标赛（这次是第六届）定于1958年夏季在瑞典举行。由于参加比赛的队很多，所以决定事先举行分区预选赛。在分区预选赛中的冠军队，将有资格参加明年的决赛。
    参加亚非区预选赛的共有八个队，抽签以后的形势是这样：中国对印度尼西亚，土耳其对以色列，埃及对塞浦路斯，苏丹对叙利亚。由于预选赛采取了单淘汰制的比赛办法，中国—印度尼西亚组的优胜者以后还将同土耳其—以色列组的优胜者比赛，产生一个争夺区的冠军的队；埃及—塞浦路斯组的优胜者将同苏丹—叙利亚组的优胜者比赛，产生另一个争夺区的冠军的队。亚非区的预选赛预定将在今年底以前结束。
