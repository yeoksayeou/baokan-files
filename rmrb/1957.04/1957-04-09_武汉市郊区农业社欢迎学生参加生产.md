Xinhua News Agency report: Agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs of Wuhan are welcoming students to participate in production.

    During the spring break, graduating students from many middle and primary schools in Wuhan have been visiting agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs, and they have been warmly welcomed by the farmers.

    On the afternoon of March 3rd, Xin Guang and Xin Sheng Agricultural Cooperatives in Jiefang Township received more than two hundred graduating senior high school students from Wuhan No. 2 Middle School. Yin Zhongping, director of Xin Guang Cooperative, said: "We welcome you to participate in agricultural production. We need knowledgeable young laborers, and we need work recorders, accountants, and technicians to jointly build a new socialist countryside."

    The suburbs of Wuhan currently face a shortage of labor and accounting personnel. Some agricultural cooperatives in the Hanqiao and Hongshan districts have production tasks that exceed the labor force's capacity. This year, they plan to carry out large-scale technological reforms and implement diversified operations, which makes the lack of labor even more pronounced. Even fewer cooperative members are capable of serving as accountants or work recorders. In Jiefang Township, out of twelve people working as accountants, only six actually know how to keep accounts, and many production teams have no one capable of serving as a work recorder. Therefore, they warmly welcome young students to participate in agricultural labor. Many cooperatives are also preparing to formulate plans based on production conditions and labor needs to welcome young students to participate in agricultural labor in the suburbs.

    武汉市郊区农业社欢迎学生参加生产
    据新华社讯　武汉市许多中、小学校的应届毕业生在春假期间陆续到郊区农业社进行访问，受到农民的热情欢迎。
    解放乡新光、新生等农业社3日下午接待了二百多个武汉市第二中学的高中毕业生，新光社社主任尹仲平说：“我们欢迎你们来参加农业生产，我们需要有知识的劳动青年，需要记工员、会计员和技术员，来共同建设社会主义新农村。”
    武汉市郊区目前存在着劳动力和会计人员不够的现象。汉桥、洪山两个区的部分农业社，生产任务超过了劳动力的负担能力。今年，他们准备进行大面积的技术改革和实行多种经营，就更感到劳动力的缺乏了。社员能担任会计、记工员的更少，解放乡有十二个人作会计，实际会记账的只有六个，不少生产队没有人能够担任记工员。因此，他们很欢迎青年学生参加农业劳动。不少合作社还准备根据生产情况、需要人力情况订出计划，来迎接青年学生参加郊区的农业劳动。
