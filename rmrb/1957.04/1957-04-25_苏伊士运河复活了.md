    The Suez Canal Revived
    Chen Bojian, Zhang Chanhua

    April 8th marked the final day of the Suez Canal clearing operations. All forty obstacles in the canal—including sunken ships and destroyed bridges—have been salvaged or towed out of the channel. Navigation marks, signals, lights, and communication systems have been fully restored, and repair factories have resumed production. Thus, the Suez Canal, whose shipping was disrupted by the Anglo-French invasion of Egypt, is about to fully reopen to navigation.

    On this very day, we arrived in Ismailia from Cairo. We visited Younis, the Director-General of the Suez Canal Authority, at the Suez Canal Authority. During our time at the headquarters, we were immediately infected by a boiling atmosphere full of working enthusiasm. Younis and senior officials from various departments of the Authority were holding a meeting, so we had to wait for him in a room. In this room, desks were piled with documents and forms, and the computer made "da-da-da" sounds. Everything here indicated that Egyptians were working hard to welcome the reopening of the Suez Canal.

    We finally waited for the meeting to end. Younis hurriedly came out to greet us, but his assistant came to inform him that the car was ready. It turned out that he was about to go to Suez to inspect the towing of the "Abu Kher" vessel. So we had to make an appointment to meet him by the canal.

    We drove south along the canal. The road was very flat, and the car sped along.

    Between Ismailia and Port Suez, the canal has more bends and passes through the Great and Little Bitter Lakes, unlike the almost straight path north to Port Said.

    Not far from Ismailia, we saw a Soviet dry dock, the "Svir," being towed south by two tugboats. She was being transferred from Odessa to Vladivostok, and the long journey had only just begun. The crew on deck sang loudly to the accompaniment of an accordion, and some waved to the people on the shore.

    We continued south, and the road left the riverbank, turning back towards the river south of the Bitter Lakes. We immediately saw the "Abu Kher" being towed.

    The towing procession could be called a fleet—two tugboats in front and two salvage ships behind. But this time they were serving only the 1,200-ton "Abu Kher" vessel. She was towed between the two salvage ships and looked so small that it was difficult to see her clearly from the shore.

    We interviewed Younis on the riverbank here. We first asked him about Egypt's preparations for the reopening of the Suez Canal, especially about the situation of the pilots, because this was the trump card that the British and French attempted to use to paralyze canal shipping after the nationalization of the canal company last July.

    Younis said that Egypt now has more pilots than the former canal company. Including more than two hundred pilots from seventeen countries, they have all received thorough training during the interruption of canal shipping.

    In the management of Suez Canal shipping, skilled pilots are a very important condition. This is not only because the canal channel is narrow and navigation is difficult, but also because the canal does not use the internationally used navigation and signal system, but a special system. Therefore, even experienced pilots must receive special training before they can pilot here. This is one of the unreasonable phenomena left by the French.

    The pilot is the shipowner's advisor during the time the ship passes through the canal. He must check the ship's draft and whether the machinery is operating normally to ensure that no ship breaks down during the convoy's passage through the canal; he must also determine the channel and speed based on the navigation marks and signals—no more than fourteen kilometers when heading south, and according to the Red Sea tide when heading north. If the speed is too fast, the sand on both banks will not be able to withstand the impact of the strong water flow. In the calm canal, even a small motorboat will stir up the surface of the water.

    Younis believes that it is not yet the right time to announce Egypt's specific plans for improving the canal, but he explained the two basic principles on which the canal improvement plan will be based. First, to strive to accommodate more ships passing through; second, to strive to accommodate larger ships, keeping up with the development of the shipbuilding industry in this regard. This means that the canal must be widened and deepened.

    Egypt's two principles of expanding the canal are a sharp irony to the former canal company controlled by the British and French colonialists. Younis said that because the canal was originally supposed to be handed back to Egypt in 1968, the old canal company was unwilling to spend more money on improving the canal. However, since the canal is part of its territory and its sovereignty over the canal is not limited by any time, Egypt will naturally do its best to develop the canal. From this point alone, Egypt's operation and management of the canal is also beneficial to the world's shipping industry.

    After visiting Younis, we toured the city of Port Suez. The Port of Suez before us is also recovering from the post-war depression. New buses are running on the streets, and small shops specializing in selling souvenirs to tourists are active again. The employees of the Suez Canal Company are working tensely, the signs of nearby shipping companies are increasing, and many travel agencies have been redecorated. The two stone carved tigers at the canal entrance sparkle in the sunlight.

    A lieutenant officer from the port police also accompanied us on a tour of the port. The water surface shimmered with golden ripples. Black fish, as big as a small boat, often appeared. Seven cargo ships of different nationalities were docked at the port, waiting to pass through the canal.

    Another cargo ship was also waiting to pass through the canal, the "Maria Victoria" flying the British flag. But its head office refused to pay the canal tolls to Egypt, and as a result, it had been prevented from entering Suez by the Egyptian canal management authorities for more than a week. According to its captain: he had received a "warning" from London not to pay the tolls to the Egyptian canal authorities. This is clearly a provocation. The crew of the "Maria Victoria" beat the captain because he would neither allow them to go to Suez nor take the ship back to the Red Sea. This shows that the crew members have become impatient with being a victim of this provocation.

    Apart from the wreck of the Egyptian cargo ship "Chamalique" (one of the largest obstacles in the canal), there are no other obstacles in the port. The gates of the canal are wide open. According to Egyptian sources, all ships of all countries that respect Egyptian sovereignty and pay tolls to it can travel unhindered in the canal. (Attached picture)

### 苏伊士运河复活了

    苏伊士运河复活了
    陈伯坚、章蟾华
    4月8日，是埃及苏伊士运河清理工作最后结束的一天。运河中四十个障碍物——包括沉船和被炸毁的桥梁等物，已经全部被打捞起来，或被拖到航道以外去了。航标、信号、灯光及通讯系统等设备已经全部修复，修配工厂也恢复了生产。至此，被英法侵略埃及战争破坏而使航运陷于停顿的苏伊士运河，就要全部恢复通航了。
    就在这一天，我们从开罗来到了伊士美利亚。我们到苏伊士运河管理局访问了运河管理局的总经理尤尼斯。在运河管理局总部逗留的时刻里，一股充满着工作热情的沸腾的气氛立即感染了我们。尤尼斯和管理局各部门的高级官员正在举行一个会议，我们只好在一个房间里等候他。在这间房子里，办公桌上堆积着文件和表册，计算机发出“哒哒哒”的声音，这里的一切都表明，埃及人正在以紧张的工作迎接苏伊士运河的重新开放。
    我们好容易等到会议结束，尤尼斯匆匆出来和我们招呼，但是他的助手却又来通知他说汽车准备好了，原来他马上就要去苏伊士，视察“阿布赫尔号”的拖运工作。于是我们只好同他约定在运河边上见面了。
    我们沿运河南行。公路非常平坦，汽车疾驶如飞。
    从伊士美利亚到苏伊士港之间，运河的弯曲比较多，而且途中经过大、小苦湖，不像北上到塞得港那样，几乎是笔直的。
    离开伊士美利亚不远，我们就看到苏联的一艘干船坞“斯吉尔号”，正由两艘拖船拖着向南航行。她是由奥德萨被调到海参崴去的，漫长的旅程仅仅还是开始。甲板上的船员在手风琴的伴奏下引吭高歌，有的向岸上的人们挥手致意。
    我们继续向南，公路离开了河岸，在苦湖以南又折向河边，立刻看到了被拖运着的“阿布赫尔号”。
    拖运的行列可以称得起是一个船队——前面两艘拖船，后边两艘打捞船。但这一回她们服务的对象却是仅仅一千二百吨的“阿布赫尔号”轮船。她被拖在两艘打捞船之间，显得那么小，以至在岸上很难看得清楚。
    我们就在这里的河岸上访问了尤尼斯。我们首先请他谈谈埃及对于苏伊士运河复航的准备工作，特别是关于领航员的情况，因为这是去年7月运河公司国有化以后英法企图使运河航运瘫痪的一张王牌。
    尤尼斯说，埃及现在拥有比前运河公司更多的领航员。包括十七个国家的二百名以上的领航员，他们在运河航运中断期间都已受过充分的训练。
    在苏伊士运河航运管理工作中，有熟练的领航员是一个很重要的条件。这不仅是由于运河航道狭窄，航行困难；还由于运河上所使用的不是国际通用的导航和信号系统，而是一套特殊的系统。因此，即使有经验的领航员，也必须受过专门的训练，才能在这里领航。这是法国人留下来的不合理的现象之一。
    领航员在船只通过运河时间是船主的顾问。他要检查船的吃水深度和机器运转是否正常，务使每一艘船不要在船队通过运河的途中发生故障；他还要根据航标和信号决定航道和航速——南下时不超过十四公里，北上时则根据红海的潮水情况来决定。如果速度太快，两岸沙土就受不住被激起的强大水流的冲击。在平静的运河里，一只很小的汽艇驶过，就会把水面激荡起来。
    尤尼斯认为目前还不是宣布埃及改进运河的具体计划的适当时机，但是他解释了运河改进计划所要依据的两个基本原则，这就是：第一，力求能够容纳更多的船只通过；第二，力求能够容纳更大的船只，跟上造船工业在这方面的发展。这就意味着运河要加宽和加深。
    埃及扩展运河的这两个原则，是对于为英法殖民者所控制的前运河公司的一个尖锐的讽刺。尤尼斯说，由于运河原来就应该在1968年交还埃及，所以老的运河公司不肯在改进运河方面多花费金钱，而埃及，则由于运河是它的领土的一部分，她对运河的主权不受任何时间的限制，所以它自然将尽力发展运河。单从这一点来看，埃及经营管理运河，对世界航运事业也是有利的。
    在访问了尤尼斯以后，我们游览了苏伊士港的市容。我们眼前的苏伊士港也正从战争结束后的萧条中恢复过来。街上驶着新的公共汽车，专门向游客兜售纪念品的小商店又活跃了起来。苏伊士运河公司的职工们都紧张地工作着，附近海运公司的招牌在增加，许多旅行社都布置一新。运河入口处的两只石雕老虎在阳光下闪闪发光。
    港口警察当局的一位中尉警官还陪同我们参观了港口。水面泛着金色的波纹。黑色的，大得像一条小船的鱼儿时常出没。港口停泊着七艘不同国籍的货船，它们正在等待通过运河。
    等待通过运河的还有另外一艘货船，这是悬挂英国国旗的“玛丽亚·维多利亚号”。但它的总公司拒绝向埃及缴纳运河通行费，因而被埃及的运河管理当局阻止在苏伊士已经一个多星期了。据它的船长说：他曾从伦敦得到“警告”，不准向埃及运河当局缴纳通行费。这显然是一种挑衅。“玛丽亚·维多利亚号”上的船员们殴打了船长，因为他既不准他们到苏伊士去，又不肯把船开回红海。这说明船员们对于他们作为这种挑衅的牺牲品已经不很耐烦了。
    沉在港口内的除了埃及货船“查马力克号”（运河最大障碍物之一）的残骸之外，再也没有其它障碍物了。运河的大门洞开着。据埃及人士说，一切尊重埃及主权、向它缴纳通行费的各国船只，都可以在运河里畅行无阻了。（附图片）
