Xinhua News Agency, April 5th: The White House announced on the 4th that US President Eisenhower had invited Japanese Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke to visit Washington from June 19th to 21st to discuss issues of "common concern" to both countries. Kishi Nobusuke has accepted the invitation.

On the same day, Kishi Nobusuke said at a press conference that the main purpose of his visit to the United States was to seek adjustments in the fundamental thinking on many issues between Japan and the United States, rather than to resolve specific issues. He said that issues requiring frank exchange of views between Japan and the United States included the issue of Japanese trade with China, Japan's defense issues, the issue of developing the Southeast Asian economy, and the thorny issues of Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands.

Kishi Nobusuke then spoke about the issue of nuclear testing. He said that Japan would seize every opportunity to demand a ban on such tests and hoped to achieve good results.

Xinhua News Agency, April 5th: A Kyodo News Agency correspondent in Washington reported that although the US government authorities welcomed Kishi Nobusuke's visit to the United States, they did not have great expectations and were not overly enthusiastic.

US government officials believe that the US government's thinking is already clear on the issues that the Japanese Prime Minister will raise during this meeting. There is a fundamental distance between the thinking of the United States and Japan. If Kishi Nobusuke holds an optimistic attitude towards this visit, believing that the United States will change its position on the outstanding issues between the United States and Japan, then his illusions will be shattered.

    艾森豪威尔邀岸信介访美
    美官方认为日美两国的想法有很大距离
    据新华社5日讯　白宫4日宣布，美国总统艾森豪威尔已经邀请日本首相岸信介在6月19日到21日访问华盛顿，讨论两国“共同关心”的问题。岸信介已经接受了邀请。
    同日，岸信介在记者招待会上说，他访问美国的主要目的是寻求在日美两国之间对于许多问题的基本想法进行调整，而不打算解决特定的问题。他说，日美两国需要坦率地交换意见的问题包括日本同中国贸易问题、日本的防卫问题、发展东南亚经济问题以及关于冲绳岛和小笠原群岛的棘手问题。
    岸信介随后谈到原子核试验问题。他说，日本将抓住一切机会要求禁止这种试验，而且希望获得良好的结果。
    据新华社5日讯　共同社驻华盛顿记者报道，美国政府当局对岸信介访问美国虽然表示欢迎，但是并没有抱着很大的期待，也不过分热心。
    美国政府人士认为，对于日本首相在这次会谈时所要提出的问题，美国政府的想法已经明确。美国同日本的想法在根本上有着很大的距离。岸信介如果对这次访问抱着乐观的态度，认为美国会改变它对日美两国之间的悬而未决的问题的立场，那末，他的这种幻想将归于破灭。
