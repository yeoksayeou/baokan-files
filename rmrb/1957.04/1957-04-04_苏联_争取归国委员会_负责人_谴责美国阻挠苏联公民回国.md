Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 3rd. The responsible secretary of the Soviet "Committee for Return to the Homeland," Dubovikov, made a statement at a press conference in Berlin on the 2nd, condemning the United States for creating rumors and employing various conspiracies in an attempt to obstruct Soviet citizens stranded in Western Europe from returning to their homeland.

He said that in the two years since the establishment of this committee, thousands of Soviet citizens have ended their wandering lives and returned to their homeland due to the amnesty decree of the Supreme Soviet, obtaining the opportunity to live and work freely together with all Soviet people.

Dubovikov pointed out that in order to use Soviet people stranded in Western Europe for anti-Soviet activities, the U.S. espionage agencies have adopted various means of threat and bribery. He said that Soviet citizens have expressed deep indignation in letters to the committee regarding the U.S. espionage agencies' use of Soviet people in distress abroad to carry out anti-Soviet activities.

Next, Dubovikov introduced Soviet citizens Kolosov, Zaleski, Gilekin-Kondrashov, and Rudakov, who had broken away from the U.S. espionage agencies. At the press conference, they described their past work in the U.S. espionage agencies, exposed the conspiracies of the U.S. espionage agencies, and expressed their determination to repent.

After the meeting, reporters visited the exhibition of evidence, which displayed photos, weapons, bottles of poison, portable spy transceivers, forged documents issued to spies by the U.S. espionage agencies, and many other pieces of evidence.

    新华社柏林3日电　苏联“争取归国委员会”负责秘书杜鲍维科夫2日在柏林记者招待会上发表谈话，谴责美国制造谣言和施展种种阴谋手段企图阻挠流落在西欧的苏联公民返回祖国。
    他说：在这个委员会成立以后的两年中，已经有数以千计的苏联公民由于最高苏维埃的大赦令而结束了流浪生活回到祖国，得到了同全体苏联人民一起自由生活和劳动的机会。
    杜鲍维科夫指出：美国间谍机关为了利用流落到西欧的苏联人进行反苏活动，采取了各种威胁和收买的手段。他说：苏联公民在给委员会的信中对美国间谍机关利用在国外陷入困境的苏联人进行反苏活动表示深切愤慨。
    接着，杜鲍维科夫向记者们介绍了已经脱离美国间谍机关的苏联公民科洛索夫、扎列斯基、吉列金—康德拉绍夫和鲁达科夫等人。他们在记者招待会上叙述了过去在美国间谍机关工作的情形，揭露了美国间谍机关的阴谋活动，并且表示了自己悔改的决心。
    会后记者们参观了罪证展览会，会上展出了照片、武器、毒药瓶、轻便间谍收发报机、美国间谍机关发给间谍的伪造文件和其他许多罪证。
