Local Vignettes

    The “Year Early Known” (a chart that enables members to know in advance the entire commune’s and individuals’ labor and income/expenditure situation), created by the Xiangyuan Forward Agricultural Cooperative in Shanxi, has been filmed. In mid-March, a cameraman from the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio came to the cooperative and filmed the creation process of the "Year Early Known" and the labor activities of the members after having the "Year Early Known." In this documentary, you can see the scene of the Li Xiumao family holding a family meeting to realize the "Year Early Known," and you can also see the female members actively working in preparing the land, preserving moisture, feeding pigs, and raising chickens.

    “一年早知道”拍成电影
    山西襄垣前进农业社创造的“一年早知道”（能使社员预先知道全社和个人劳动、收支情况的图表）已经拍成电影。3月中旬，中央新闻纪录电影制片厂的摄影记者来到社里，把“一年早知道”的创造过程和有了“一年早知道”以后社员们的劳动活动情况拍成了电影。在这部纪录片里，可以看到社员李修茂全家为实现“一年早知道”开家庭会的情形，还可以看到女社员们整地保墒喂猪养鸡积极劳动的情形。
