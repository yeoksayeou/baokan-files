Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, April 4th: Steel for making tractor tracks has been successfully trial-produced at the Anshan Iron and Steel's Large Rolling Mill. Inspection results prove that this new product meets Soviet standards. The width, height, thickness, and arc of the track steel, as well as the distance between the centerlines, are all qualified. The mechanical tensile strength, yield strength, elongation, and reduction of area also meet the standards. The only area for improvement is that there are still some minor folding phenomena on the surface of the track steel. The deputy director of the Large Rolling Mill said: This track device, when installed on a tractor, can climb high mountain cliffs at an angle of forty-five degrees. In order to more accurately test the lifespan and mechanical properties of this track, a portion of the trial-produced products will be handed over to the Anshan Iron and Steel Transportation Department for trial use on bulldozers and tank-type cranes.

    拖拉机履带在鞍钢制成
    新华社鞍山4日电　制作拖拉机履带的钢材在鞍钢大型轧钢厂试制成功。检验的结果证明，这种新产品达到了苏联标准。履带钢材的宽度、高度、厚度和弧度，以及中心线的距离都合格。机械的拉力、屈伏力、延伸力和断面收缩力也都合标准。只是在履带钢材表面还有一些微小的折叠现象，有待改进。大型轧钢厂副厂长说：这种履带装置在拖拉机上，能爬行四十五度的高山峭壁。为了更精确的试验这种履带的寿命和机械性能，试制出来的一部分产品，准备交给鞍钢运输部装置在推土机和坦克式吊车上试用。
