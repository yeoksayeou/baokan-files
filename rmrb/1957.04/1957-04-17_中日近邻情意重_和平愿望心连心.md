    China-Japan Neighbors Share Deep Affection; Peace Wishes Link Hearts
    (I) To the Editor-in-Chief of the "People's Daily" in Beijing:
    At the end of last year, when I visited your country, I received friendly hospitality from Chinese friends, which deeply moved me and I will never forget.
    After returning to our country, in order to expand Japan-China friendship, promote the restoration of Japan-China diplomatic relations, and strengthen economic, cultural and technical exchanges, we have done our best to hold report meetings and discussion meetings. We also reported the true situation of New China to the Japanese people through publications, radio, television, and so on.
    The posters showing your country's construction that I received from you, and the documentary films presented by Mr. Guo Moruo: "The First Step in Transforming the Yellow River" and "Across the Mountains of Bashan and Shu," are all valuable reference materials and play a great role in helping the masses in our country understand China.
    I wish your country prosperity and development!
                          Ito Nagamitsu, Director of the Tokai Industrial Economics Research Institute
                                              April 8, 1957
    (II) To the Friends of Sasaki Sadako:
    I saw your letter in the "People's Daily" in Beijing on March 31st. Reading the letter from Japanese young friends should be a pleasant thing, but I feel very angry in my heart, because I learned that Sasaki Sadako died of atomic disease. The death of the healthy and lively Sasaki Sadako is a great misfortune, but when I saw your sad and indignant words, and your firm expression to defend peace, I felt unspeakably happy.
    Like you, Chinese youth are firmly opposed to war. Our work, study, and life are all pleasant, and precisely because of this, we deeply understand how important it is to defend peace. I am a public servant (government staff) of our people. To protect the happiness of our people, I must fight to the end against warmongers, and it is glorious even to sacrifice my own life. We Chinese youth sincerely wish to unite with Japanese young friends and work together to defend peace!
                                                                Lu Shouhuai, Fanchang County, Anhui Province
    (III) Dear Japanese young friends Yoshida Katsuhisa and others:
    I was very happy to see your letter in the "People's Daily" in Beijing. I express brotherly respect for your will to oppose war and defend peace.
    The Japanese people are capable, and the Japanese people have a bright future. This is the impression I got from the Japanese commodity exhibition. In recent years, the Japanese people have become increasingly united in the struggle to defend peace and independence, and have continuously achieved victories. Under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, we Chinese people are building a prosperous and happy country. The Chinese people are willing to coexist peacefully with the people of all countries, and are willing to make friends with all peace-loving people in the world. The Chinese people cherish the fruits of their peaceful labor and have the confidence and strength to defend it. China and Japan are close neighbors, and the peaceful wishes of the people of the two countries are the same. Let us join hands and work together!
                                                                Chen Yaguang, Anshan Railway Worker Reader's Letter

### 中日近邻情意重　和平愿望心连心

    中日近邻情意重　和平愿望心连心
    （一）北京“人民日报”总编辑先生：
    去年年底，我在贵国访问的时候，曾得到中国朋友们的友好款待，使我深深感激，而且永远不能忘怀。
    我们回国之后，为了扩大日中友好和促使中日邦交的恢复，并加强经济、文化和技术交流，曾尽棉薄之力举行了报告会和恳谈会，还通过出版物和广播、电视等等，向日本国民报告了新中国的真实情况。
    从您那里得到的表示贵国建设情况的招贴画，郭沫若先生赠送的记录影片：“改造黄河的第一步”、“越过巴山蜀水”，都是难得的参考资料，对我国大众了解中国情况起着很大的作用。
    敬祝贵国兴隆发展！
                          东海产业经济调查所所长　伊藤长光
                                              1957年4月8日
    （二）佐佐木祯子的朋友们：
    我在3月31日的北京“人民日报”上，看到了你们的来信。阅读日本青年朋友的信，应该是一件愉快的事情，但是我的心中非常气愤，因为我知道了佐佐木祯子患原子病死去了。健康活泼的佐佐木祯子的死是一个很大的不幸，但是当我看到你们的悲愤的话语，和坚决保卫和平的表示，又感到说不出的高兴。
    和你们一样，中国青年是坚决反对战争的。我们的工作、学习和生活，一切都是愉快的，正是因为这样，我们深深懂得保卫和平是何等重要的事情。我是我国人民的一个勤务员（机关工作人员），为保卫我国人民的幸福，一定要和好战分子斗争到底，就是牺牲了自己的生命也是光荣的。我们中国青年诚心诚意地愿意和日本青年朋友团结起来，为保卫和平共同奋斗！　　安徽省繁昌县　鲁守槐
    （三）亲爱的吉田胜久等日本青年朋友们：
    我在北京“人民日报”上看到你们的来信，从内心里感到高兴。对于你们反对战争、保卫和平的意志，表示兄弟般的敬意。
    日本人民是能干的，日本人民有远大的前途，这是我从日本商品展览会上得到的印象。几年来，日本人民在保卫和平和独立的斗争中，日益紧密地团结起来了，并且不断地取得了胜利。我们中国人民在中国共产党的英明领导下，正在建设繁荣幸福的国家。中国人民愿意和各国人民和平共处，愿意和普天下的爱好和平的人交朋友。中国人民珍重自己的和平劳动的果实，并且有信心有力量来保卫它。中日两国是近邻，两国人民的和平愿望是一致的，让我们携起手来共同奋斗吧！　　　　　　　　　　　安东铁路工人　陈亚光读者来信
