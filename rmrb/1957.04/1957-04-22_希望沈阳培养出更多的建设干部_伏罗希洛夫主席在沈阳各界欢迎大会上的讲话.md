Comrades and Brothers:

We came to your ancient city, Shenyang, to meet you and to see your beautiful industrial city. We are here in the People's Republic of China representing the Soviet people, our government, and our Communist Party, to convey our deep friendship and high respect for the Chinese people. The extremely warm welcome we received from the people of Shenyang deeply moved us, the representatives of the Soviet people. We saw the hundreds of thousands of residents of your city welcoming us, saw the joyful faces welcoming us, saw the red flags and bouquets in the hands of the people of Shenyang, like a sea of flowers and red flags, and heard the enthusiastic cheers for the Soviet people accompanied by national music. This made me understand and feel more strongly and deeply that the friendship between the Soviet and Chinese people is truly unbreakable, a truly fraternal friendship. This friendship inspires the people of our two countries to make great achievements for the happiness of our people and the future of mankind.

The Soviet people are proud to have such loyal friends as the Chinese people and the people of other socialist brother countries. The Soviet Union has proven in the past and continues to prove through its actions that it is ready to do everything possible to consolidate the friendship between socialist brother countries, to give all kinds of assistance to peace-loving and free peoples, as long as such assistance can promote the continuous consolidation and development of friendship between freedom-loving peoples, and as long as such assistance can promote the continuous increase in the strength of these countries. The growth of this friendship and strength between us is more powerful than the forces of imperialists launching aggressive wars.

The welcome you gave us the day before yesterday was a most important and grand event that will remain forever in our hearts. We are very happy to have the opportunity to meet with the workers of Shenyang here.

Because the people of Shenyang are at the forefront of the struggle to realize national industrialization and complete the First Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. We are deeply impressed by the remarkable labor achievements that the Chinese people have made in a very short period of time after the victory of the revolution. The achievements you have made once again prove that the people who have embarked on the road of socialist construction possess inexhaustible creative power.

The history of Shenyang is a glorious and vivid history of the Chinese people's struggle on the military and labor fronts under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.

As everyone knows, the fighting tradition of the workers of Shenyang grew up in the struggle against the Japanese occupiers and domestic reactionaries. Speaking of this, one cannot help but recall the heroic armed uprising of the workers of the Shenyang Arsenal on March 29, 1932, against the Japanese invaders, as well as the great feat of the Shenyang workers who carried out guerrilla warfare during the Japanese occupation. In the Liaoshen Campaign, which ended on November 2, 1948, liberating Shenyang and the entire Northeast, many sons and daughters of Shenyang shed their blood.

We know that the workers of Shenyang will sacredly inherit these fighting traditions and engage in selfless labor, so that no imperialist or their running dogs will dare to invade the great China that has won freedom again.

In the years since the people seized power, the workers of Shenyang have done a lot of work. The ruins left by the Kuomintang and some semi-handicraft factories have now been replaced by modern factories, whose products are famous abroad.

The Soviet people are very clear about your labor victories. Not long ago, the Soviet people celebrated with you the start of construction and the commissioning of the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant and the Cable Factory, as well as other enterprises.

Yesterday, we were very satisfied to visit the Machine Tool Plant, the Machine Manufacturing Plant, and the Cable Factory. These factories are very superior in all aspects and can serve as examples for any country in the world. But even better than these factories are those excellent, trained work cadres, those young, life-loving, serious, and wise male and female workers standing beside the machine tools and at their work posts. They give us the impression that they are not only good experts, but also the true masters of these huge factory enterprises.

Such young technical engineers and workers are also a clear example of the rapid growth of the new productive technological knowledge community of the People's Republic of China. We are very satisfied with the products of all the factories we visited; these products are excellent in both quality and appearance.

Comrades, we were told that Shenyang is a place for training cadres; now, workers and experts from Shenyang can be found on every construction site in your country. This is the glory of your city, and of course, it also places a greater moral responsibility on you to enable Shenyang to train more good cadres who will bring greater glory to your city.

Dear comrades, the comprehensive and deep friendship between the Soviet Union and China and their peoples is developing day by day. The joint statement signed by the Chinese government delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai during its visit to the Soviet Union in January of this year once again convincingly demonstrated the unity of our two countries. Countless large and small things done for the benefit of the Soviet and Chinese peoples embody our great friendship at all times.

For example, last year, various Soviet states and cities and various Chinese provinces and cities began to exchange delegations, such as the mutual dispatch of youth delegations between Irkutsk and Shenyang. This will undoubtedly bring many benefits to the people of our two countries. Frequent exchange of all the good things of the two peoples most clearly demonstrates the fraternal friendship between China and the Soviet Union, and demonstrates the common desire of socialist countries to learn valuable experiences from each other so that everyone can continue to move forward. We toured your city, visited your factories, and met with workers and factory technicians, and we clearly saw that the Chinese working class and all workers are closely united and, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, are confidently advancing along the road of socialist construction.

Dear comrades, we sincerely congratulate you on achieving new and outstanding achievements in peaceful socialist construction.

We thank you for your warm and fraternal welcome.

Long live the great Chinese people!

Long live the Chinese working class!

Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the Soviet and Chinese people!

Long live the leaders of the People's Republic of China, headed by the most beloved Comrade Mao Zedong!

Long live world peace! Long live!

    希望沈阳培养出更多的建设干部
    ——伏罗希洛夫主席在沈阳各界欢迎大会上的讲话亲爱的同志们和兄弟们：
    我们来到你们的古老城市——沈阳市，是为了和你们会见，是为了看看你们美好的工业城市。我们到中华人民共和国来是代表苏联人民、我国政府和我们的共产党，来转达对中国人民的深厚友谊和崇高的敬意。沈阳市的人民对我们极为热烈的欢迎，使我们——苏联人民的代表深深感动。我们看到了你们城市数十万居民对我们的欢迎，看到了欢迎我们的那些愉快的面孔，看到了沈阳市人民在手中拿着红旗和花束，像海洋一样的一些花束和红旗，听到了在民族音乐的伴奏下对苏联人民的热情的欢呼，这使我更强烈地和更深刻地了解和感受到苏中两国人民的友谊是真正牢不可破的、是真正的兄弟般的友谊，这种友谊鼓舞着我们两国人民，为了我们人民的幸福和人类的未来在建立伟大功勋。
    苏联人民感到骄傲的是她有着像中国人民和其他社会主义兄弟国家的人民这样的忠诚的朋友。苏联过去和现在都以自己的行动证明为了巩固社会主义兄弟国家间的友谊，准备尽一切的力量来给予爱好和平和自由的各国人民以这样或者那样的援助，只要这种援助能够促进爱好自由的各国人民之间的友谊的不断巩固和发展，只要这种援助能够促进这些国家的威力的不断增涨，苏联都尽一切的力量给予这种援助，我们之间的这种友谊和威力的增涨，比帝国主义者发动侵略战争的力量还更强大。
    前天，你们对我们的欢迎，是一件最重大最隆重的事件，它将永远地留在我们的心里，我们有机会在这里同沈阳的劳动者见面，感到十分高兴。
    因为沈阳市的人民是站在实现国家工业化和提前完成第一个五年计划的斗争中的最前列。我们看见中国人民，在革命胜利之后，在很短的时期内，取得了卓越的劳动的成果，这使我们感到十分钦佩。你们获得的成就，再一次证明走上社会主义建设道路上的人民，是拥有无穷无尽的创造的力量。
    沈阳市的历史，是中国人民在中国共产党领导下，在军事战线上和在劳动战线上进行斗争的光辉的生动的历史。
    大家知道，沈阳市劳动者的战斗的传统，是在反对日本占领者和国内反动派的斗争中成长起来的。谈到这一点，不能够不使人回忆起在1932年3月29日沈阳兵工厂工人们为反对日本侵略者而举行了英勇的武装起义，以及沈阳的工人在日本统治时期，进行了游击战争的这个伟大的功绩。在1948年11月2日结束的解放沈阳和全东北的辽沈战役中，有许多沈阳的儿女们洒下了自己的鲜血。
    我们知道，沈阳的劳动者会神圣地继承这些战斗的传统，并且从事奋不顾身的劳动，使任何帝国主义者及其走狗都不敢再一次侵犯获得了自由的伟大的中国。
    在人民取得政权以来的年代中，沈阳的工人作了许多工作，国民党遗留下的废墟和一些半手工业性质的工厂，现在都被现代化的工厂代替了，这些工厂的产品是闻名国外的。
    苏联人民十分清楚地知道你们在劳动上取得的胜利。不久以前，苏联人民和你们一起庆祝了沈阳重型机器厂和电缆厂以及其它一些企业的开工和投入生产。
    昨天，我们非常满意地参观了机床厂、机器制造厂和电缆厂，这些工厂在各方面都是非常优越的，它们可以成为世界任何国家的榜样。但是，比这些工厂更美好的东西还是那些优秀的有训练的工作干部，站在机床旁边的、站在自己工作岗位上的那些年青的、热爱生活的而且又严肃、智慧的男女工人们。他们给我们的印象是，他们不仅是好的专家，而且也是这些巨大的工厂企业的真正的主人。
    这样年青的技术工程师和工人，也正是中华人民共和国新的生产技术知识界迅速成长的鲜明例证。我们对所有参观过的工厂的生产品，都很满意；这些产品，无论在质量和外型上都是优良的。
    同志们，有人告诉我们，说沈阳是一个培养干部的地方；现在，在你们国家的每一个建设工地上，都可以遇见来自沈阳市的工人和专家。这是你们城市的光荣，当然，这也就使你们在道义上负有更大的责任，让沈阳市能够培养出更多的为你们城市带来更大光荣的好的干部。
    亲爱的同志们，苏中两国及其人民之间的全面的深厚的友谊是日益发展的。以国务院总理周恩来同志为首的中国政府代表团，在今年1月访问苏联的时候，签署了苏中联合声明，再一次令人信服地证明了我们两国的团结一致。为苏中两国人民的利益而作的无数大小事情，都无时无刻不在体现着我们之间的伟大友谊。
    比如说，在去年，苏联的各个州和市以及中国的各个省和市，开始互派代表团，如像伊尔库次克和沈阳市之间就互相派遣了青年代表团。这无疑地会给我们两国人民带来很多的好处。经常交换两国人民的一切的美好的东西，最明显地表现出中苏之间的兄弟友谊，表现出社会主义国家的共同愿望，彼此吸取宝贵的经验，以便大家继续前进。我们游览了你们的城市，参观了你们的工厂，同工人、工厂技术人员见了面，我们清楚地看见，中国工人阶级和所有的劳动者紧密地团结在一起，在中国共产党的领导下，满怀信心地沿着社会主义的建设道路而前进。
    亲爱的同志们，我们衷心祝贺你们在和平的社会主义建设中，取得新的卓越的成就。
    我们感谢你们的热烈的兄弟般的欢迎。
    伟大的中国人民万岁！
    中国工人阶级万岁！
    苏中两国人民永恒的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    以最亲爱的毛泽东同志为首的中华人民共和国的领导人万岁！
    世界和平万岁！万岁！
