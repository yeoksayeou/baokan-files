Editorial: Boldly Let Go, Open Up the Repertoire

    Since the first National Opera Repertoire Work Conference in June of last year, various regions have carried out a large amount of work in excavating and sorting out opera repertoires, which has changed the performance situation on the opera stage. Tens of thousands of repertoires have been revived on the stage, breaking the situation of a poor selection of performed programs, enlivening artistic creation, appropriately meeting the cultural and entertainment needs of the masses, and generally increasing the attendance rate of most theaters, which has improved the lives of performers. In addition, many forgotten opera genres have been discovered from the excavation of repertoires; a team of professional and amateur opera writers has also been organized from the excavation. All of these are gratifying achievements obtained in the opera work by vigorously implementing the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend."
    The fact that such great results have been achieved in a short period of only a few months fully proves that China's opera heritage is indeed very rich. We have a responsibility to inherit and carry forward this valuable wealth created by the working people over thousands of years. Our generation of opera artists and drama workers bear this historical task of carrying on the past and opening up the future in opera.
    Recently, in order to summarize the achievements of this stage of work, exchange experiences, overcome shortcomings, and further improve the opera repertoire work, the Ministry of Culture of the Central Government held the Second National Opera Repertoire Work Conference. Based on Chairman Mao's instructions on correctly handling contradictions among the people, the meeting enthusiastically discussed various problems that occurred in the opera work, and determined that it is necessary to continue to boldly let go and open up the repertoire on the basis of vigorously implementing the central policy and consolidating existing achievements. This point is very important.
    In the process of opening up the repertoire last year, a small number of repertoires with unhealthy ideological content also appeared, which frightened some people, who demanded "收" [shōu - withdraw] and "禁" [jìn - prohibit]. They were afraid that the theaters would become chaotic. In fact, according to surveys and statistics from various regions, bad repertoires containing toxins are a very small minority, less than 1% of the repertoires being performed. The current problem is not that the opening up of the opera repertoire is enough, but that the "letting go" is far from enough. Insufficient understanding and estimation of the importance of excavating and sorting out traditional repertoires is still a fairly common phenomenon.
    We believe that adopting a policy of boldly letting go of traditional repertoires has more advantages than disadvantages. We have favorable conditions: First, the ability of the vast majority of audiences to distinguish has improved. Second, the political and ideological level of the broad masses of performers has improved. Third, opera is basically created by the working people, and most of it carries a strong sense of the people. Fourth, cultural leadership departments at all levels have a certain amount of experience in opera work. With these four points, those well-intentioned people should no longer be afraid, and should believe that letting "a hundred flowers bloom" in the opera field will not cause "chaos under heaven."
    What exactly is the significance of opening up the repertoire? There are currently fewer repertoires that reflect new life, so why is it so important to attach importance to traditional repertoires? If we view the creation of new art and the inheritance of tradition as opposed to each other, we will become more and more confused. But once we recognize that socialist national new art must be built on the basis of the national art heritage, and that it can only be a product of the inheritance and development of the national art heritage, then we will not doubt it. Although some of the traditional opera art will be eliminated, namely the dross, the excellent parts of it must be inherited and developed. Developing socialist national new art on the basis of inheriting excellent traditions is an inevitable trend, but this will never be a linear development without difficulties; it must go through long-term hard work and tortuous roads to be completed. So being eager for quick success is not feasible. Dogmatists do not understand this principle; they always hope that a "sudden change" will occur one morning, and a "brand new" opera will appear. They always metaphysically oppose "old" and "new," drawing a dividing line, not knowing that "pushing out the old to bring forth the new" is a dialectical developmental relationship. Moreover, in the past two or three decades, especially after the Anti-Japanese War, opera culture has been greatly damaged: many opera genres have been lost, troupes have been dispersed, old artists have retired, and there is a lack of successors, creating a gap between generations. After liberation, although there has been a great recovery, it is still not enough. Therefore, in the current stage, special attention should be paid to the traditional repertoires, traditional performing arts, and musical singing styles of opera, and a comprehensive excavation should be carried out, so that the development of opera art can be based on a solid and rich foundation.
    In order to do this work well, we now put forward opinions on several more important issues in the opera work for consideration by party and government leading organs, cultural authorities, and art workers in various regions.
    1. Some people are now asking: Has the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, push out the old to bring forth the new" changed? Can we stop talking about "pushing out the old to bring forth the new"? Our answer is: Absolutely not. This fundamental policy for the development of opera cannot be separated. It is inevitable that some poisonous weeds will appear in the midst of a hundred flowers blooming and competing for beauty. The competition between flowers and weeds, between good plays and bad plays, is a phenomenon that conforms to the laws of artistic development in the situation of "a hundred flowers blooming." In this case, we must not ignore the aspect of "pushing out the old to bring forth the new." It is precisely through "pushing out the old to bring forth the new" that flowers can defeat weeds. After we correctly grasp the policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, push out the old to bring forth the new" to carry out our work, we can optimistically predict that in a few years, thousands of excellent traditional repertoires, through the hard work of our generation, will become a great wealth in the socialist national new culture.
    2. Does advocating the excavation and sorting out of traditional repertoires mean ignoring newly written repertoires? Our answer is: Absolutely not. While "letting out" old repertoires on the one hand under the policy of "a hundred flowers bloom", we must also help new repertoires to grow and develop on the other hand. Newly written historical dramas and modern dramas are undoubtedly very needed. The problem is how to coordinate and arrange the series of heavy tasks of excavation, sorting, adaptation, and creation when the team of opera playwrights is still very small. What we are currently facing is tens of thousands of traditional repertoires, and how to sort them out and perform them is an urgent problem. It is hard to imagine that we can ignore such a large number of ready-made repertoires, not sort them out, not study them, and only create behind closed doors. It should be recognized that sorting out and adapting traditional repertoires is a very good learning process, which can lay the foundation for our creation. At the same time, a good adaptation is also a good creation. Those who despise this aspect of work are essentially expressing a kind of nihilistic thought about national art. However, the work of sorting out and adapting traditional repertoires is a fairly long-term work, and it is impossible to finish sorting out all the traditional repertoires before creating new ones. Therefore, while sorting out traditional repertoires, appropriate arrangements must be made for the creation of new scripts. We hope that cultural authorities in various regions will make proper consideration based on the specific local conditions. For an opera playwright, he should be interested in sorting out and adapting old repertoires, and also strive to use new themes (including modern and historical) to create new repertoires. These two aspects of work can be combined.
    3. Opera is an art with a strong collective nature, and the work cannot be done well if only one aspect of artists makes efforts. Therefore, it is particularly necessary to strengthen unity and cooperation in many aspects. For example, cooperation between opera genres, between troupes, between artists, between artists and new literary and art workers, between young actors and old artists, and between opera and other sister arts. In particular, the cooperation between artists and new literary and art workers is related to the future of opera development. Old artists and new literary and art workers both play a major role in the development of opera. Today, new literary and art workers must first learn from artists with humility, strive to master the knowledge and laws of traditional opera art, and try to avoid the style of dogmatism and sectarianism. Artists must also learn from new literary and art workers and acquire modern cultural and scientific knowledge, which will help to improve their art. If they can learn from each other's strengths and help each other, it will play a decisive role in promoting the development of opera art. Young actors should also diligently and painstakingly learn from old artists and master the rich performing arts as much as possible. They must recognize that they are the successors of the old artists, and that the excellent skills of opera that have been honed over thousands of times need to be inherited, developed, and passed on by themselves. The view of despising technology and the attitude of disrespecting master teachers are completely wrong.
    4. Opera is an art with a strong mass character. Every day's performance is connected to millions of audiences and affects the lives and thoughts of millions of people. It is an important tool for the Party and the People's Government to educate the people. Therefore, party committees, governments, and cultural authorities in various regions should attach sufficient importance to this cause, guide opera to serve the people well and serve socialist construction, and help opera workers establish a multi-faceted, new, and close relationship with the vast new audiences of workers, peasants, soldiers, and intellectuals. The attitude that opera is backward and not worth considering is completely wrong. As for arbitrarily banning the performance of repertoires and unreasonably making things difficult for troupes, if such things happen to any organ or any leader, they are illegal and undisciplined behaviors, which must be resolutely stopped.
    In the past seven years, the achievements of opera work have been great. It is believable that under the guidance of the new policy of "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend," opera, which has a mass base, will develop more rapidly; it is believable that the flowers in this opera garden will bloom more beautifully and competitively.

### 大胆放手，开放剧目

    大胆放手，开放剧目
    去年6月间第一次全国戏曲剧目工作会议以来，各地进行了大量的挖掘整理戏曲剧目的工作，使得戏曲舞台的演出状况为之一变。数以万计的剧目重新复活到舞台上，打破了上演节目贫乏的局面，活跃了艺术创造，适当满足了群众的文化娱乐需要，大多数剧场的上座率也得以普遍提高，艺人的生活也因之有所改善。此外，从挖掘剧目中发现了许多被遗忘的剧种；也从发掘中组织成了一支包括职业和业余戏曲作家的队伍。所有这些，都是在戏曲工作中，大力贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针所得到的可喜的收获。
    在不过几个月的短时期内，就取得了这样巨大的成果，完全证明我国的戏曲遗产实在是非常丰富。这一份千百年来劳动人民所创造的宝贵财富，我们是有责任把它继承下来加以发扬的，我们这一辈的戏曲艺术家和戏剧工作者们是负有这个戏曲上继往开来的历史任务的。
    最近，中央文化部为了总结这一阶段的工作成绩，交流经验，克服缺点，进一步把戏曲剧目工作做好，又召开了第二次全国戏曲剧目工作会议，会上根据毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的指示，热烈讨论戏曲工作中所发生的各种问题，确定了必须在大力贯彻中央方针和巩固已有成绩的基础上，继续大胆放手，开放剧目。这一点是十分重要的。
    在去年开放剧目的过程中，也出现了少数思想内容不健康的剧目，于是有人惊慌了，要求“收”，要求
  “禁”。他们害怕剧场混乱起来。其实，根据各地的调查统计，含有毒素的坏剧目是极少数，不及上演剧目的1％。目前的问题，不是戏曲剧目开放已经够了，而是“放”的还很不够。对挖掘整理传统剧目的重要性认识不足，估计不够，仍是目前相当普遍的现象。
    我们认为对传统剧目采取大胆放手的方针，是利多弊少的。我们存在着有利的条件：一、绝大多数观众鉴别的能力提高了。二、广大艺人的政治思想水平提高了。三、戏曲基本上是劳动人民创造的，大多数带着强烈的人民性。四、各级文化领导部门，对戏曲工作有了一定的经验。有这四条，那些善意的人们，应当不必再害怕了，应当相信在戏曲这块园地内让“百花齐放”，是不会“天下大乱”的了。
    开放剧目的意义究竟何在呢？目前表现新生活的剧目还少，为什么偏要这样重视传统剧目呢？如果把创造新艺术和继承传统对立起来看，就会越想越不通。但是一旦认识到社会主义的民族新艺术，必须建立在民族艺术遗产的基础上，它只能是民族艺术遗产继承和发展的产物，那就不会怀疑了。传统的戏曲艺术中虽然会被淘汰一部分即糟粕的部分，但对其中优良的部分必然要继承下来，加以发展。在继承优良传统的基础上发展社会主义的民族新艺术，这乃是必然的趋势，但这决不是直线地、毫无困难地发展的；而是要经过长期的艰苦工作，曲折的道路，才能完成。所以急于求成是不行的。教条主义者便不懂这个道理，他们总希图在一个早晨，来个“突变”，“全新”的戏曲就出现了。他们总是把“陈”与“新”形而上学地对立起来，划一道鸿沟，不晓得推陈出新是辩证的发展关系。更因为近二三十年来，特别是抗日战争以后，戏曲文化遭到了很大的破坏：许多剧种失传，剧团流散，老艺人息影，后继缺人，青黄不接。解放后，虽有很大的恢复，但是还不够得很，因此，在现阶段对于戏曲的传统剧目，传统的表演艺术和音乐唱腔等，应予特别重视，全面挖掘，这才能使得戏曲艺术的发展，建立在稳固和雄厚的基础上。
    为了做好这个工作，现在就戏曲工作中的几个较重要的问题提出意见，供各地党政领导机关、文化主管部门和艺术工作者考虑。
    一、现在有些人问：“百花齐放、推陈出新”的方针是否改变了呢？“推陈出新”这一条是否可以不讲了呢？我们的回答是：决不可以。这个戏曲发展的根本方针是不能割裂的。在百花齐放、争妍斗盛的当中，出现一些毒草是难免的。鲜花与毒草争长，好戏与坏戏竞赛，正是“百花齐放”的局面中合乎艺术发展规律的现象。在这种情况下，决不能忽视“推陈出新”的这一面。正是要经过“推陈出新”才能使鲜花战胜毒草。当我们正确掌握了“百花齐放、推陈出新”的方针去进行工作之后，可以乐观地预料，在若干年后，成千上万的优秀传统剧目，经过我们这一代人的辛勤劳动，会成为社会主义的民族新文化中的一笔大财富。
    二、现在提倡挖掘整理传统剧目，是不是忽视新编剧目呢？我们的回答是：决不是。“百花齐放”一面把老剧目放出来，一面也必须帮助把新剧目生长发展起来。新编的历史剧和现代剧，无疑是非常需要的。问题是目前戏曲剧作者的队伍还很不大而面临着挖掘、整理、改编、创作这一系列的繁重任务时我们如何统筹安排。我们现在首先面临的是数以万计的传统剧目，如何整理它、上演它，是一个迫切的问题。很难设想，我们可以抛开这样大量的现成剧目不管，不去整理，不去研究，只管关门创作。应当认识，对于传统剧目的整理改编是一个很好的学习过程，是可以为我们的创作打下基础。同时改编得好，也就是好的创作。轻视这方面工作的人，实质上还是对民族艺术的一种虚无主义的思想表现。但是，传统剧目的整理改编工作，是一个相当长期的工作，不可能先把传统剧目都整理完了然后再去创作，因此，在整理传统剧目的同时，必须对新剧本的创作做适当的安排。这一点希望各地文化主管部门，根据当地的具体情况作妥善的考虑。就一个戏曲作家来说，他应该是既有兴趣整理和改编老剧目，也努力采用新题材（包括现代的和历史的）创作新剧目，这两方面的工作是可以结合起来进行的。
    三、戏曲是集体性很强的一种艺术，单靠一方面的艺术家去努力，工作是做不好的。因此特别需要加强多方面的团结与合作。比如剧种之间，剧团之间，艺人之间，艺人与新文艺工作者之间，青年演员和老艺人之间，戏曲和其他姊妹艺术之间的合作等等。特别是艺人与新文艺工作者的合作，关系着戏曲发展的前途。老艺人和新文艺工作者在发展戏曲工作中都有重大的作用。在今天，新文艺工作者首先要向艺人虚心学习，努力掌握传统戏曲艺术的知识和规律，力戒教条主义和宗派主义的作风。艺人们也要向新文艺工作者学习，取得现代的文化科学知识，才有助于在艺术上的提高；彼此如能取长补短，互助合作，对于戏曲艺术的发展，是能起决定性的推动作用的。还有青年演员们，更要辛勤刻苦地向老艺人学习，把丰富的表演艺术，尽量掌握起来，必须认识到自己是老艺人的接班人，戏曲中千锤百炼的优秀技术，是需要靠自己来继承、发展和传授下去的。轻视技术的观点和不尊重老师傅的态度是完全错误的。
    四、戏曲是群众性很强的一种艺术，每天的演出，联系着千百万观众，影响着千百万人民群众的生活和思想。它是党和人民政府教育人民的一项重要工具。因此，各地党委、政府和文化主管部门，应当足够地重视这项事业，指导戏曲很好地为人民服务、为社会主义建设服务，帮助戏曲工作者跟工农兵和知识分子这一广大的新的观众建立多方面的、新的、密切的联系。那种认为戏曲落后不屑一顾的态度，是完全错误的。至于随意禁演剧目，蛮不讲理地刁难剧团，这种事如果发生在任何机关或任何领导人身上，都是违法乱纪的行为，尤其必须坚决制止。
    七年来，戏曲工作的成绩是巨大的。可以相信，在目前“百花齐放、百家争鸣”新方针的指导下，有着群众基础的戏曲，定会更加迅速地发展；相信这戏曲花园中的鲜花，定会更加争妍斗盛地开放起来。
