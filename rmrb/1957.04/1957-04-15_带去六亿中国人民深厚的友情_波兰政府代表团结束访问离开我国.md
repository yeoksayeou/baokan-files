Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, April 14th: The government delegation of the Polish People's Republic, led by Chairman of the Council of Ministers Józef Cyrankiewicz, concluded its visit to China and left Shenyang by plane at 9:30 this morning to visit the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of Korea, Pak Sung-chul, accompanied them.

Chairman Cyrankiewicz delivered a farewell speech at the send-off ceremony held at Dongta Airport. He said:

Dear Provincial Governor Comrade, dear Chinese Comrades and Friends:

The delegation of the Polish people is about to bid farewell to the hospitable Chinese people and leave China today. We are about to leave your country, but we are taking away the deep friendship and profound feelings of the Chinese people towards us. We received a warm welcome from the Chinese people in Guangzhou, Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Shenyang.

We personally felt and witnessed the ever-deepening friendship between the people of China and Poland. We will convey the profound friendship of the great Chinese people – the Chinese people who are building socialism – to our people.

The friendship of the Chinese people towards the Polish people will help the Polish people's socialist construction.

We are very satisfied with the talks we had with the leading comrades of China.

We have personally witnessed that the Chinese people are overcoming various difficulties and developing rapidly. We have seen new factories under construction in many cities. We have seen the same in Shenyang.

We know that there are still some difficulties in your construction of a strong motherland. We understand this because we are also building a new life and building a new country. However, we are convinced that the Chinese people will be able to develop faster and faster.

Your rapid development is of great significance to the Chinese people, to the socialist camp, and to the cause of human progress.

We sincerely thank the Chinese people for their hospitality.

We wish you all success in your work and all success in your socialist construction.

We salute the Chinese working class, peasants, intellectuals, women, and youth.

Long live the People's China!

Long live the Sino-Polish friendship!

Long live your great leader Comrade Mao Zedong!

Long live the Communist Party of China!

Long live the great unity of socialist countries!

Dear comrades, we thank you and shout to you again: Goodbye!

Liaoning Provincial Governor Du Zheheng delivered a farewell speech at the beginning of the send-off ceremony. Du Zheheng said: We sincerely thank you for bringing the great, profound, and brotherly friendship of the Polish people to the Chinese people. We are convinced that this will further inspire the labor enthusiasm of the people in our province and country who are engaged in socialist construction, and the unbreakable friendship and close unity between the people of China and Poland will forever remain in the hearts of our people.

At 9:00 a.m., Chairman Cyrankiewicz, accompanied by Liaoning Provincial Governor Du Zheheng and Shenyang Mayor Liu Baotian, arrived at Dongta Airport, where more than 5,000 well-dressed well-wishers were already waiting. They cheered in unison to pay their respects to the distinguished guests. Du Zheheng accompanied Chairman Cyrankiewicz to review the guard of honor, and then walked towards the send-off crowd, waving goodbye.

Among those who came to the airport to see them off were the heads of various agencies, people's organizations, and democratic parties in Liaoning Province and Shenyang City, as well as the Soviet and Korean consuls general in Shenyang and Polish experts in Shenyang.
