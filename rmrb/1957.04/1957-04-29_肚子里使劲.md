    Getting Even Internally
    Yuan Shuipai
    "Good for you, kid! This time you think you're so great,
    Saying I'm 'quite subjective,'
    Saying I 'reject criticism,'
    And even 'suppress' and 'retaliate,'
    How awful sounding!
    You actually dared in front of everyone
    Without respect
    To put me—
    (A loud bang on the table)
    —on blast!
    Humph, when I was making revolution,
    You were still crawling under the table!
    "Okay, this time you showed off,
    Made a splash, but,
    You watch out!
    I'll let you see what's what,
    I'll make sure you have nowhere to turn,
          Your home is in turmoil,
          Not even the dogs and chickens are safe!
    "Of course,
    (Head swiveling around)
    This time, hmph,
    I'll just get even internally..."
    (A hint of a smile playing on the lips)
    Not a word
    Was spoken aloud,
    Just muttered silently in the heart.
    Because, these thoughts
    Though satisfying,
    Can't see the light of day! (Attached image)

    肚子里使劲
    袁水拍
    “好小子！这回算你行，
    说我嚜‘相当主观’，
    说我嚜‘拒绝批评’，
    还有什么‘压制’‘报复’，
    多么难听！
    你居然当着众人
    没大没小
    把我——
    （桌子上啪的一声）
    ——批评了一顿！
    哼，老子革命的时候，
    你还在桌子底下爬！
    “好，这回你逞能，
    出了风头，可是，
    你小心！
    老子要叫你瞧瞧颜色，
    我要弄得你走头无路，
          家宅不安，
          鸡犬不宁！
    “当然啰，
    （脑袋在空中转了一圈）
    这回，哼，
    我只在肚子里使劲……”
    （嘴角边浮起一丝笑影）
    一番话
    都没有说出声，
    只是心里面暗暗地念叨。
    因为，这些想法
    虽则痛快，
    却见不得人！（附图片）
