Overall Arrangement of Herdsmen and Draught Animals
    ——Livestock Management Experience of the Taiyangsheng Agricultural Cooperative in Fangcheng County, Henan

The Taiyangsheng Agricultural Cooperative in Shenying Township, Fangcheng County, Henan Province, is a large cooperative with more than 1,000 households, established in January of last year. At the time of its establishment, the cooperative had a total of 667 draught animals (including 522 head of cattle, 135 donkeys, 3 mules, and 7 horses), as well as 1 stallion, 1 donkey stallion, and 4 bullocks for breeding. All these livestock were collectively raised by the cooperative. By April, 42 head of cattle had died, and 197 were weak and emaciated. The rate of empty pregnancies among female animals was also serious. Out of 115 fertile cows, 102 did not bear calves, and only 5 out of 60 female donkeys and horses had foals. The shortage of animal power caused great difficulties in production, requiring people to pull carts and ploughs, which aroused dissatisfaction among the cooperative members.

The Party branch and the management committee of the agricultural cooperative conducted a serious analysis of this problem and found that the main root causes were: excessive publicity about the use of tractors at the time of the cooperative's establishment, which made cadres and members underestimate the importance of draught animals; after the establishment of the cooperative, the leadership of livestock raising work was neglected, the system was unsound, and the remuneration was unreasonable. All these frustrated the enthusiasm of the members in caring for draught animals. For example, the 16th production team was criticized and had work points deducted for doing less work related to mating cows. The herdsmen saw that not only were they not given extra work points for producing more young animals, but they were also deducted points if they did not meet the work quota. Therefore, they were unwilling to mate and breed the animals. People who used the animals were only willing to use large cattle and bulls, and did not want small cattle and cows. After finding the root causes, the cooperative immediately established a livestock management committee, abolished unreasonable regulations, and took many measures to strengthen leadership.

They conducted in-depth ideological education for the members. In addition to using various methods to educate them about the unity of collective and individual interests, they also used the method of calculating accounts and comparisons to illustrate that doing a good job in livestock breeding and reproduction was the main key to increasing production and income. They calculated two accounts with the members: First, the losses. Not long after the cooperative was established, 42 cattle died and 100 fewer cattle were bred. Calculated in terms of money, the total loss was 9,910 yuan, an average of more than 8 yuan per household. Second, the labor involved. Taking the 19th production team as an example, the whole team had 720 mu of land, and the labor required for cattle alone was 1,056 workdays per year. After discussion, the members realized that draught animals were still very important property after collectivization and needed to be well cared for. At the same time, the cooperative also organized a livestock breeding observation meeting and commended good herdsmen. The vivid facts educated the members and greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the herdsmen, strengthening their sense of responsibility. Those who were active became more active, and those who were not active were also motivated.

On the basis of the improved understanding of the members, the livestock management committee also convened herdsmen to jointly study and revise various systems and methods, and to formulate livestock care and protection covenants and feeding management operating procedures. After discussion and revision by the members, these were handed over to the production teams for implementation. The main methods and systems are:

① The cooperative's livestock were divided into pairs according to size, gender, strength, weakness, fatness, thinness, speed, good or bad grazing habits, etc., and assigned to each team for their own feeding and use. The livestock management committee was responsible for overall leadership of the whole cooperative, and the feeding team leader in each team was responsible for the feeding and management of the entire team.

② Different labor quotas were set for draught animals with different physical strengths. For example, when ploughing loess land, the quota for a large ox was 3 mu per head per day, for a medium-sized ox 2.7 mu, for a small ox 2.3 mu, and for a pregnant medium-sized cow 1.5 to 2 mu per day. In this way, members would not only compete to use the large ones. It was also stipulated that pregnant animals should not be used for heavy work, and should have appropriate rest before and after delivery. During pregnancy, they should rest for one half-day every three days. If the person using the cattle broke the quota in order to compete for work points, causing the pregnant animal to miscarry or become sick, they would not be given extra points and would also be criticized.

③ Herdsmen and users should communicate and exchange information on feeding and service; herdsmen should regularly study and exchange experiences; herdsmen should contact the clinic to regularly check the livestock, and promptly treat them when illnesses are found. In addition, the herdsmen should also report the feeding, use, and reproduction of the livestock, as well as any problems, to the cooperative director, so that the management committee could discover problems in time and help solve them.

④ Establish a evaluation and reward system. The evaluation contents were: comparing barn hygiene, comparing manure accumulation, comparing reproduction, and comparing conservation. A red flag competition was launched with monthly evaluations and quarterly observations. From April to October of last year, two observation meetings were held, eight model teams and twenty-five model livestock care and protection workers were selected and awarded prizes, and were also commended at the meeting, encouraging the enthusiasm of all members for livestock care and protection.

⑤ Strengthen epidemic prevention and mating work. The cooperative hired a veterinarian to join the cooperative, established a clinic and three mating stations, and during the slack season, the veterinarian was responsible for training young epidemic prevention workers. The cooperative trained a total of thirteen epidemic prevention workers with a junior high school education, and five of them are now able to diagnose and treat general diseases, and the rest have also learned about epidemic prevention injections.

After the implementation of these measures, abnormal livestock deaths were quickly eliminated, and most of the female animals became pregnant. By October, the phenomenon of weak and emaciated draught animals had been completely eliminated. Thirteen cows gave birth to calves, and donkeys and horses also produced three foals. Other livestock and poultry also developed greatly. This greatly increased the amount of manure accumulated, enabling 95% of the winter-sown fields to be adequately fertilized.

Before the winter of last year, they again made an overall arrangement for the draught cattle and herdsmen. Several incompetent herdsmen were replaced; winter management methods were formulated according to the different sizes and fatness of the draught animals; thirty-eight old and weak draught animals that had lost their ability to work and could not survive the winter were sold to the food company; and dilapidated barns with poor insulation were also repaired. As a result, all the draught animals safely survived the winter. (Adapted from materials supplied by the Fangcheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China)

    统筹安排饲养员和耕畜
    ——河南方城县太阳升农业社的牲畜管理经验
    河南省方城县沈营乡太阳升农业社是个一千多户的大社，是去年1月份建立的。建社的时候，全社共有六百六十七头耕畜（其中有黄牛五百二十二头、驴一百三十五头、骡子三匹、马七匹），还有种公马一匹、种公驴一头、种公牛四头。这些牲畜全由社里集体喂养。到4月份，全社就死了四十二头牛，瘦弱的有一百九十七头。母畜空怀也很严重，有繁殖能力的母牛共一百一十五头，就有一百零二头没怀犊，六十头母驴、母马，只有五头有驹。畜力不足的情况给生产带来了很大的困难，要用人力去拉车、拉犁，引起了社员的不满。
    党支部和农业社管理委员会对这个问题进行了认真的分析，找出产生问题的主要根源是：建社的时候过多地宣传了要用拖拉机，使干部和社员轻视了耕畜；建社以后，也忽视了对养畜工作的领导，制度不健全，报酬也不合理。这些都挫折了社员爱护耕畜的积极性。例如第十六生产队因为母牛配种做活少，受了批评还被扣工分，饲养员看到多生幼畜不但不多记工分，做活达不到定额还扣分，于是都不愿意配种繁殖，用牛的人也只愿意用大牛、公牛，不愿要小牛、母牛。找到根源以后，社里立即成立了牲畜管理委员会，取消了不合理的规定，并采取了许多措施加强领导。
    他们向社员深入地进行了思想教育。除了利用各种方式进行集体利益和个人利益一致性的教育以外，还用算账对比的方法说明做好牲畜饲养繁殖工作是增加生产、增加收入的主要关键。他们同社员一起算了两笔账：一算损失。社刚建成不久，就死了四十二头牛，少繁殖一百头牛，若折成钱计算，共计损失了九千九百一十元，平均每户摊八元多。二算用工。光以第十九生产队为例，全队七百二十亩地，一年光牛工就要一千零五十六个。经过讨论，社员认识到合作化以后耕畜仍然是很重要的财产，需要很好地爱护。同时，社里还组织了牲畜饲养参观大会，表扬了好的饲养员。活生生的实事教育了社员，也大大鼓舞了饲养员的积极性，加强了他们的责任心，原来积极的更加积极了，原来不积极的也被带动起来了。
    在社员认识提高的基础上，牲畜管理委员会又召集饲养员共同研究修订了各项制度和办法，订立爱畜保畜公约和饲养管理操作规程。经过社员讨论修改以后，交给各生产队执行。几项主要的办法和制度是：
    ①把全社牲畜按大小、公母、强弱、肥瘦、快慢、吃草好坏等分别搭配成犋，包给各队自己饲养，自己使用。全社由牲畜管理委员会负责总的领导，各队由饲养组长负责全队的饲养管理工作。
    ②对不同体力的耕畜，订出不同的役使工作定额。如犁黄土地，用大牛每头每天的定额是三亩，用中等牛二点七亩，用小个子牛二点三亩，用怀孕的中等母牛每天一亩半到二亩。这样，社员就不会只抢大的用了。另外还规定不用孕畜做重活，在产前产后要适当休息，怀胎期间三天要休息一晌；如果用牛的人为了争工分，突破定额而使孕畜流产或生病，不多记分，还要批评。
    ③饲养员和使用人要联系，交换喂养和役使情况；饲养员之间定期学习和交流经验；饲养员和诊疗室联系，定期给牲畜检查，发现病情及时治疗。此外，饲养员还要向社主任报告牲畜饲养、使役、繁殖的情况和问题，使管委会能够及时发现问题，帮助解决。
    ④建立评比奖励制度。评比的内容是：比畜舍卫生，比积肥，比繁殖，比节约。开展一月一评比、一季一观摩的红旗竞赛。从去年4月到10月，举行过两次观摩大会，评出八个模范队，二十五个爱畜保畜模范，发给奖品，还在大会上表扬，鼓舞了全体社员爱畜保畜的热情。
    ⑤加强防疫、配种工作。社里聘请兽医入社，设立了一个诊疗室和三个配种站，农闲时兽医负责培养青年防疫员。全社共培养了有高小文化程度的防疫员十三人，现在已经有五人能作一般病症的诊断和简易治疗，其余的也学会了防疫注射。
    实行这些办法以后，很快就杜绝了牲畜的非正常死亡，大部分母畜都怀了孕。到10月份已全部消灭了耕畜瘦弱的现象。有十三头母牛生下小牛，驴、马也产了三个小驹。其他家畜家禽也有了很大的发展。这就大大地增加了积肥量，使95％的冬播田施足了肥料。
    在去年过冬以前，他们又把耕牛和饲养员做了一次统筹安排。调换了几个不能胜任的饲养员；根据耕畜的大小肥瘦不同情况，分别订出过冬管理办法；将失去耕作能力又过不了冬的三十八头老弱耕畜卖给食品公司；对破烂和保温条件不好的畜舍也进行了修理。这样做，使全部耕畜安全地度过了冬季。（根据中共方城县委供给的材料改编）
