According to a Heilongjiang Daily report on April 13th: Over ten thousand construction workers have entered the construction site of the Qiqihar Heavy Machinery Plant, preparing for the upcoming construction climax.

The main large-scale production workshops of the Qiqihar Heavy Machinery Plant—including the large metalworking, hydraulic press, steel casting, and rough machining heat treatment workshops—fourteen workshops in total, will all begin construction this year. The steel casting workshop covers an area of ​​more than 37,000 square meters and is about 40 meters high. Underneath the workshop, more than 4,100 reinforced concrete piles, ranging from 12 meters to 24 meters in length, will be driven densely to form a solid foundation.

The civil engineering for this factory is being undertaken by the Engineering Department Direct Engineering Company, which constructed the Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. In the company's office, experienced engineers are carefully reviewing the construction organization design at their desks. Several engineering departments responsible for factory building construction have been established and are meticulously compiling construction operation plans. A large-scale construction base—a combined processing plant—is rushing to produce prefabricated concrete components. The already completed concrete piles, roof panels, and concrete columns are being transported by giant trailers to the construction site in a continuous stream. Hundreds of trucks and large vehicles transport sand and gravel to various construction sites every day. The Shanghai Foundation Engineering Company, responsible for the foundation engineering, has erected eight pile drivers on the construction site and has begun preparing for pile driving. The Northeast Second Mechanized Construction Company, responsible for mechanized construction, has transferred hundreds of large-scale lifting, transportation, and hoisting machines from Shenyang, Changchun, and Harbin and has completed the final inspection work. The metal structure factory is being relocated from Harbin to the construction site, and the Northeast Electromechanical Installation Engineering Company, responsible for electromechanical installation engineering, has also arrived at the construction site and is making preparations for equipment installation.

    又一座苏联帮助建设的大工厂
    富拉尔基重型机器厂迎接施工高潮
    本报讯　据4月13日黑龙江日报报道：万余建设大军已进入富拉尔基重型机器厂工地，迎接即将到来的施工高潮。
    富拉尔基重型机器厂的主要大型生产厂房——大型金工、水压机、铸钢、粗加工热处理等十四个车间，在今年全面动工兴建。铸钢车间占地面积三万七千多平方公尺，高约四十公尺，在车间的地下要打下密密麻麻的十二公尺到二十四公尺长的四千一百多根钢筋混凝土桩子，组成坚固的地基。
    这座工厂的土建工程是由建设过长春第一汽车制造厂的建筑工程部直属工程公司担任的。在公司的办公室里，有经验的工程师，正伏在桌前审拟着施工组织设计。担任厂房建筑的几个工程处已经组成，并详尽地编排着施工作业计划。一个规模宏大的施工基地——联合加工厂正赶制着混凝土预制件。已经制成的混凝土桩、屋面板、混凝土柱，正由巨型拖车源源地运往施工现场。每天，有数百台汽车和大车把砂石运往各工地。担任基础工程的上海基础工程公司，已在工地上架起八台打桩机，并开始了打桩的准备工作。担任机械化施工的东北第二机械化施工公司，已从沈阳、长春、哈尔滨调来成百台的大型起重、运输、吊装机械，并已完成最后检修工作。金属结构工厂正在从哈尔滨向工地迁移，担任机电安装工程的东北机电安装工程公司也来到了工地，正进行着设备安装前的准备工作。（附图片）
