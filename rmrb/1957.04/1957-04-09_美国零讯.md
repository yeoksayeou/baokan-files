    American Zero News
    Ten Thousand Taxes
    The magazine "U.S. News & World Report" reported that Americans are currently taxed on "almost every move." For every three dollars an American earns, one dollar is taken by the U.S. government in the form of taxes.
    The magazine pointed out that many Americans have part of their income deducted by the government under the name of "federal income tax" even before they receive their wages or salaries. An American has to pay taxes when buying cigarettes, whiskey, jewelry, enjoying social security, installing a telephone, using the highway, and so on.

    Treasury Strapped, Heavily in Debt
    According to Associated Press reporter Dawson, since July 1 last year, the U.S. Treasury's inventory was $57 billion, but withdrawals amounted to $58 billion. Dawson said that a heavy burden on the U.S. Treasury is short-term debt. The U.S. government currently has debts due and debts to be repaid within the next year totaling $122 billion, almost half of the total debt.

    Struggling for Agricultural Production Reduction
    According to the April 1st issue of "Time" magazine, the area of U.S. grain farmland this year is 334 million acres, a decrease of 12 million acres compared to 1956, making it the smallest sown area since 1917. The decrease in cultivated land area is due to the government's restrictions on the production of many kinds of grains in order to reduce the quantity of surplus agricultural products. However, due to farmers switching to other crops and deep plowing, surplus agricultural products are still increasing. The U.S. government currently has more than $7 billion in surplus agricultural products in storage.

    美国零讯
    万税万万税
    “美国新闻与世界报道”杂志报道，美国人目前“差不多一举一动都要纳税”，一个美国人所赚到的每三块美元当中，就有一块美元要被美国政府以赋税的形式征去。
    杂志指出，目前许多美国人甚至在没有领到工资或者薪金时，他的一部分收入就要在“联邦所得税”的名义下被政府扣去。一个美国人买香烟、买威士忌酒、买珠宝、享受社会保险、安装电话、使用公路等等，都无一不要纳税。
    财库拮据　负债累累
    据美联社记者道逊报道，去年7月1日以来，美国财库的库存额是五百七十亿美元，但是提款额却高达五百八十亿美元。道逊说，美国财库的一个沉重负担是短期债务。美国政府目前到期的债款和今后一年中要偿还的债务总额是一千二百二十亿美元，几乎占全部债款的一半。
    为农业减产而斗争
    据4月1日的“时代”周刊报道，今年美国的谷物耕地面积是三亿三千四百万英亩，比1956年减少了一千二百万英亩，成为1917年以来播种面积最小的一年。耕地面积的减少是因为政府限制许多种谷物的生产，以减少剩余农产品的数量。但是由于农民改种其他作物和进行深耕，剩余农产品还在增加。目前美国政府积存的过剩农产品已有七十多亿美元。
