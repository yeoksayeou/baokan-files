Every day, the raw materials brought into this cooperative are carts of dirty and smelly garbage, cinders, and mud, but what is pulled out are various metals. The cooperative has thirty-four members. Last year, they extracted more than 3,600 taels of silver, more than 192,300 catties of miscellaneous copper, more than 174,200 catties of lead, and more than 15,700 catties of aluminum from garbage and mud. In addition, there were several tons of metals such as tin and zinc, worth more than 520,000 yuan in total. There are many veteran smelting craftsmen in this cooperative who are experts in finding treasure and can accurately identify what is contained in the garbage.

    “奇怪”的工厂
    从垃圾堆里找出宝贝，从烂泥里炼出金属，西安市第一冶炼生产合作社因此被称为“奇怪”的工厂。每天这个社拉进来的原料是一车一车又脏又臭的垃圾、炭渣和烂泥，拉出去的却是各种金属。社里有三十四个社员，去年一年从垃圾、烂泥里共提炼出白银三千六百多两、杂铜十九万二千三百多斤、铅十七万四千二百多斤、铝一万五千七百多斤，另外，还有几吨锡、锌等金属，一共值五十二万多元。这个社有许多老冶炼匠，是觅宝的能手，能准确地发现垃圾中含有什么东西。
