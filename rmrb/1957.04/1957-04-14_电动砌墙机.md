    Electric Bricklaying Machine
    Long Wenzhong, a technician from the Wuhan Fourth Construction Engineering Company, has created an "electric mortar-extruding bricklaying machine." Using this machine, four people can lay 18,000 to 24,000 bricks per hour. This is not only four to five times faster than manual bricklaying, but also makes the walls tighter, stronger, and neater. The Ministry of Construction Engineering has assessed this machine and has decided to mass-produce it.
    This machine is simple in structure and lightweight. Workers only need to feed the bricks into the machine in the correct order, and it will automatically extrude the mortar and lay the bricks. If the brick feeding stops, the machine will also automatically stop.

    电动砌墙机
    武汉市第四建筑工程公司技师龙文忠创造了一种“电动挤浆砌墙机”。用这种机器砌墙四人操作每小时可砌砖一万八千块至二万四千块。这不但比手工砌砖快四至五倍，并且砌的墙紧密牢固整齐。建筑工程部鉴定了这一机器以后，已经决定大量生产。
    这种机器构造简单、轻便，工人只要把砖按照操作顺序送进机器后，它就会自动挤浆、砌砖；一停止送砖，机器也便自动停止。
