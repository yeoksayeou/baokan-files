Xinhua News Agency, Jerusalem, Israel District, March 3rd: Israeli Foreign Minister Golda Meir said in parliament on the 2nd that Israel had firmly rejected the suggestion of allowing the United Nations Emergency Force to be stationed within Israeli territory.

Israel's attitude is to insist that the United Nations Emergency Force occupy the Gaza Strip. Mrs. Meir said that the situation there has "deteriorated" since the Egyptians returned to Gaza.

Mrs. Meir also demanded the "de facto and de jure" recognition of Israel's right to passage through the Suez Canal. She insisted that Israel should have freedom of navigation in the Gulf of Aqaba.

    以色列蛮横无理
    拒绝联合国部队驻在境内
    新华社3日讯　耶路撒冷以色列区消息：以色列外交部长梅厄夫人2日在议会说，以色列已经坚决地拒绝了让联合国紧急部队驻在以色列境内的建议。
    以色列的态度是坚持要联合国紧急部队占领加沙地带。梅厄夫人这样说，自从埃及人回到了加沙以来，那里的局势“恶化”了。
    梅厄夫人还要求“在事实上和法律上”承认以色列通过苏伊士运河的权利。她坚持以色列要在亚喀巴湾自由航行。
