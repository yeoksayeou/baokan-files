Xinhua News Agency, April 3rd: The Ministry of Agriculture, the Department of Urban Services, and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives today issued a joint notice on vigorously preventing and controlling swine infectious diseases, requiring agricultural, urban service, and supply and marketing departments in all regions to cooperate closely and jointly perform the following tasks:

	(1) Conscientiously investigate and grasp the patterns of epidemic disease prevalence. Under the leadership of local Party and government leading organs and the pig production guiding committees, formulate prevention and control plans, make comprehensive arrangements, and carry out prevention and control. Strive to basically control the prevalence of major infectious diseases within a few years.

	(2) Vigorously publicize common knowledge about preventing and controlling swine infectious diseases to agricultural cooperatives; actively assist agricultural cooperatives in establishing epidemic prevention organizations and formulating epidemic prevention systems; train epidemic prevention personnel for agricultural cooperatives; and guide agricultural cooperatives to breed piglets themselves to avoid introducing epidemic diseases through the purchase of piglets. Newly purchased piglets must be quarantined and determined to be disease-free before being mixed with the original pig herd. Promote keeping pigs in pens and disinfecting them regularly. After an infectious disease occurs, do a good job of isolation, blockade, and disinfection.

	(3) Carry out immune preventive injections for three infectious diseases: swine fever, swine erysipelas, and swine pneumonia. In areas where epidemic diseases are prevalent and areas where swine infectious diseases have occurred in recent years, efforts should be made to inject all pigs to enable them to generally obtain immunity.

	(4) To strengthen the epidemic prevention force, personnel in urban service departments who purchase live pigs in rural areas should gradually acquire general scientific and technical knowledge of preventing and controlling swine infectious diseases. The method is to organize training during the off-season. This year, a group of personnel should be trained to participate in epidemic prevention work based on needs.

	(5) When managing live pigs and transporting piglets, ensure that epidemic prevention and hygiene work are done well. Strengthen transportation quarantine and slaughter inspection to prevent the spread of epidemic diseases during transportation and sales. Slaughterhouses must treat blood, water, and manure in accordance with veterinary hygiene requirements.

	The notice concludes by stating that the current period is the season for the prevalence of swine infectious diseases. All regions should organize forces to carry out prevention and control and require relevant departments to do a good job in the production and supply of vaccines to ensure the needs of epidemic prevention.

    做好猪传染病的防治工作
    农业部、城市服务部、供销总社发出通知
    据新华社3日讯　农业部、城市服务部、全国供销合作总社今天发出大力防治猪传染病的联合通知，要求各地农业、城市服务和供销合作部门密切配合，共同做好以下各项工作：
    （一）切实调查和掌握疫病流行规律，在当地党政领导机关和生猪生产指导委员会的领导下，制定防治规划，作出全面安排，进行防治。争取在几年内基本上控制主要传染病的流行。
    （二）大力向农业社宣传防治猪传染病的常识；积极帮助农业社建立防疫组织，订立防疫制度；培养农业社防疫员，指导农业社自繁仔猪，避免因购入仔猪传入疫病。对新购入的仔猪一定要经过隔离认为无病之后再与原有猪混群饲养。提倡养猪有圈、定期消毒。发生传染病后作好隔离、封锁、消毒工作。
    （三）开展猪瘟、猪丹毒、猪肺疫等三种传染病的免疫预防注射。凡疫病流行地区和近年内发生过猪传染病的地区，都应该力争给全部猪只进行注射，使猪只普遍能得到免疫能力。
    （四）为壮大防疫力量，城市服务部门在农村收购生猪的人员应该逐步做到都具备有一般的防治猪传染病的科学技术知识。办法是在业务淡季组织训练。今年即应根据需要，训练一部分人员参加防疫工作。
    （五）在经营生猪和调运仔猪的时候，要切实做好防疫卫生工作。加强运输检疫和屠宰检验，防止疫病在运输途中和销售过程中的传播。屠宰场对血水粪便要按照兽医卫生的要求进行处理。
    通知最后说，当前正是猪传染病流行季节，各地应组织力量进行防治，并要求有关部门要做好疫苗的生产和供应工作，以保证防疫的需要。
