    A Reasonable Solution to the Suez Canal Issue
    By a Commentator of this Newspaper

    On April 24, the Egyptian government issued a declaration on the future operation of the Suez Canal. This declaration puts forward a reasonable solution to the Suez Canal issue.

    This declaration by the Egyptian government fully demonstrates the firm will of the Egyptian government to safeguard national sovereignty and dignity, abide by international obligations, and ensure the free navigation of the canal. In the declaration, the Egyptian government reaffirmed its determination to respect the terms and spirit of the 1888 Convention of Constantinople, abide by the United Nations Charter, and guarantee to provide and maintain free and unimpeded navigation to all countries. The declaration also put forward fair and reasonable proposals on issues such as business management, financial arrangements, and dispute resolution, in line with the principles and spirit of Egyptian national sovereignty and international law. If Western countries can adopt a realistic attitude and stop using the Suez Canal issue to create tension in the Middle East, then they have no reason not to accept Egypt's declaration and restore the Suez Canal's pivotal role in connecting Eurasian transportation.

    According to many facts, the colonialists have not learned enough lessons from the series of events since the Suez Canal issue arose. After Egypt announced the nationalization of the Suez Canal Company last year, Western countries clamored to boycott the canal and took various malicious measures to disrupt canal traffic. Although the United Nations Security Council adopted six principles for resolving the canal issue on October 13 last year, and Egypt was prepared to negotiate with Britain and France based on these six principles, Britain and France completely abandoned the Security Council's resolution and colluded with Israel to launch a war of aggression against Egypt in an attempt to reoccupy the canal. As a result, their aggression failed shamefully. And the damage they caused to the canal brought them huge losses.

    After the end of the war, Egypt quickly cleared the canal, restoring its function, while the United States, Britain, and France attempted to continue to boycott the canal, and put pressure on Egypt from all sides, still attempting to infringe upon Egyptian sovereignty and re-implement the so-called "international control" of the canal. However, their conspiracy to boycott the canal failed again. More and more ships passed through the canal. Even British and American ships, ignoring the warnings and intimidation of the British and American governments, have already passed or are planning to pass through the canal according to Egyptian conditions.

    However, the imperialists, led by the United States, have not given up. They are now re-introducing the six principles passed by the Security Council, which they had long abandoned, particularly emphasizing the so-called "the operation of the canal shall not be related to the politics of any country," attempting to achieve so-called "international control" based on their own interpretation of this clause. They are also trying to force the Egyptian government to recognize the so-called "Users' Association" organized by Western governments, in order to control the Suez Canal Company through this "association." To continue to put pressure on Egypt, the United States has requested the United Nations Security Council to meet on April 24 to discuss the Suez Canal issue.

    In the letter attached to the copy of the Egyptian government's declaration sent to the United Nations Secretary-General, Egyptian Foreign Minister Fawzi pointed out that this action requesting registration with the United Nations "expresses their understanding of the resolution adopted by the Security Council on October 13, 1956, and is based on the statements they made in the Security Council regarding this issue." Therefore, the United States and other Western countries have no reason to use the Security Council's resolution to create unnecessary complications. Western countries should face the fact that the Suez Canal is part of Egyptian territory. Any attempt to infringe upon Egyptian sovereignty will not work. Egypt has shown great goodwill and understanding in resolving the Suez Canal issue. Whether the Suez Canal issue can be resolved now depends entirely on the Western countries led by the United States.

    解决运河问题的合理方案
    本报评论员
    4月24日，埃及政府发表了苏伊士运河未来经营问题的宣言。这个宣言给解决苏伊士运河问题提出了合理的方案。
    埃及政府的这个宣言，充分表现了埃及政府维护国家的主权和尊严、遵守国际义务、保证运河自由通航的坚定意志。埃及政府在宣言中重申它决心尊重1888年君士坦丁堡公约的条款和精神，遵守联合国宪章，并且保证向所有国家提供并维持自由无阻的航行。宣言并且对经营管理、财政安排、解决争端等问题，提出了符合于埃及国家主权和国际法原则和精神的公平合理的主张。如果西方国家能够采取现实的态度，不再利用苏伊士运河问题在中东制造紧张局势，那末，它们就没有理由不接受埃及的宣言，而使苏伊士运河恢复它在沟通欧亚交通中的枢纽作用。
    根据许多事实看来，殖民主义者们还没有从苏伊士运河问题发生以来的一连串事件中接受足够的教训。在去年埃及宣布苏伊士运河公司国有化以后，西方国家就大肆叫嚷要抵制运河，并且采取种种恶劣手段破坏运河的交通。虽然联合国安全理事会在去年10月13日通过了解决运河问题的六项原则，埃及也准备根据这六项原则同英、法进行谈判，可是英、法却完全抛开安全理事会的这个决议，串同以色列对埃及发动了侵略战争，企图重新占领运河。结果，它们的侵略可耻地失败了。而它们对运河所进行的破坏，却给它们自己带来了巨大的损失。
    在战争结束之后，埃及迅速清理了运河，使运河恢复了它的功能，而美、英、法却一面企图继续抵制运河，一面对埃及从各方面施加压力，仍然企图侵犯埃及主权，重新实现对运河的所谓“国际管制”。可是，它们抵制运河的阴谋又失败了。越来越多的船只通过了运河。就是英国和美国的船只，也不顾英、美政府的警告和恫吓，已经按照埃及的条件通过或者正在想通过运河。
    然而，以美国为首的帝国主义者们并没有死心。它们现在重新搬出早被它们抛弃了的安全理事会通过的六项原则，特别强调其中所谓“运河的经营将同任何国家的政治不发生关系”这一条，企图根据它们自己对这一条的解释，来实现所谓“国际管制”。它们还企图硬要埃及政府承认西方国家政府所组织的所谓“使用国协会”，以便通过这个“协会”来控制苏伊士运河公司。为了继续对埃及施加压力，美国已经在4月24日要求联合国安全理事会开会，讨论苏伊士运河问题。
    埃及外交部长法齐在把埃及政府的宣言的副本送交联合国秘书长时所附的信中就指出，这一要求联合国登记的行动，“表示了他们对于安全理事会在1956年10月13日所通过的决议，并且根据他们在安全理事会上所发表的关于这个问题的声明而得出的了解”。因此，美国和其他西方国家没有任何理由再利用安全理事会的决议来节外生枝。西方国家应当正视这个事实：苏伊士运河是埃及领土的一部分。任何侵犯埃及主权的打算都是行不通的。埃及在解决苏伊士运
  河问题上已经表示了极大的善意和谅解。苏伊士运河问题能否解决，现在完全要看以美国为首的西方国家了。
