Chairman Cyrankiewicz's Speech
Dear Premier Zhou Enlai, Dear Mayor Peng Zhen, Dear Comrades and Friends, Dear Young People:

Today, I stand before the residents of the glorious capital of great China, and I am deeply moved. We are moved, first of all, because I and all the members of the Polish government and people's delegation can directly convey to you the Polish people's love and feelings of solidarity; and also because we know that your revolution has brought great progress to the 600 million people of your great motherland, and it shows great prospects for China, the most populous country in the world. We are very happy to be able to speak to the residents of the capital of our 600 million friends' country.

We are not unfamiliar with your country and your history. Although before liberation, both you and we were pawns at the mercy of imperialist powers, and we did not know much about each other, we have become much closer to each other in the short few years after we gained freedom. Before World War II, only the progressive forces in Poland knew about your struggle. I still remember how excited we were when we heard the news of your heroic struggle against the aggression of Japanese militarism and against domestic reactionaries, at a time when the tide of fascism and militarism was sweeping the world. I want to say again that at that time, only the most progressive people in our Social Democratic Party, first of all the working class, knew about your struggle and cared about your struggle. But after the war, the situation was completely different. Your struggle to liberate yourselves from the shackles of the Kuomintang reactionaries and their foreign accomplices inspired the Polish people. When the news of the Chinese People's Liberation Army liberating Beijing reached the Unity Congress of our party, the enthusiasm of the delegates reached its peak, and the people of the whole country were elated by the news.

Where does this sympathy and affinity come from? I think there are two main reasons. The first reason is that the Polish people, who have been oppressed by foreign aggressors countless times in history, are particularly sensitive to the struggle for liberation and are full of enthusiasm for the people who have already gained freedom.

The second reason is that the road you have chosen to build socialism and liberate the people from more than 100 years of exploitation and shackles under the leadership of your party, which has been tested in nearly 40 years of struggle, is dear to us, because that is also the road we are taking.

Is it easy to walk such a road, is it a road paved with roses? Of course not. We also have difficulties to overcome. We thank those friends who criticize us and help us eliminate our shortcomings. But it is ridiculous for those imperialist groups who still do not recognize the fact that the formerly oppressed people of Asia and Africa have freed themselves from their shackles, continue to pursue gunboat diplomacy, and feel that it is still the 19th century and not the 20th century.

Please, those who are trying in various forms to maintain the greatest shame of our century—colonialism—do not teach us!

In the short period of less than thirteen years, we have transformed Poland into an industrialized country with an annual output of five million tons of steel and nearly 100 million tons of coal. During this period, we built tens of thousands of schools and hospitals and rebuilt Warsaw, the capital city that was destroyed by the Hitler occupiers. During this period, we strengthened our international position, strengthened our solidarity with socialist countries, and transformed the borders that were once full of disputes and conflicts into borders of peace and friendship with the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, and Czechoslovakia.

In the short few days of staying in your country, we have seen that you have done a lot of work in the seven years since the founding of the Republic. We have personally witnessed the construction of Guangzhou, the new urban areas of ancient Beijing, and especially the thousands of happy children.

Some countries do not recognize the existence of China, just as a blind man cannot see the sun. Is it because the sun does not exist that he cannot see it? Or is it because he is blind? Because he is blind.

Dear Friends and Comrades:

We came to you from those Asian countries we have visited. Those countries have different social systems and different paths of development. Although there are these differences, a common point connects these countries, they have all fought against colonialism for decades or hundreds of years for their own independence, they all actively defend peace, they all hate imperialism and strive to improve the backwardness caused by foreign oppression in the past hundred years. Only here in Asia can we personally see and believe how great the power represented by the people of these countries, which account for half of humanity, is. As a Pole, I am very proud because our people, who are always united with the oppressed people, are valued by the people of this ancient continent, the cradle of human culture. As a communist, I am proud because in the cause of socialist transformation, we stand in the same ranks with the Soviet Union, the first socialist country, and the people's democracies of Europe, as well as with the great Chinese people. Today, the Chinese people are building a huge Anshan Iron and Steel Complex for themselves and for their great country with the same wisdom as building a great masterpiece of architectural art.

The people of our two countries have formed a fighting alliance in socialist construction, in the struggle to overcome today's difficulties and for the continued development of socialism, and in the struggle to defend our achievements from the ambitious aggression of hostile forces. No force in the world can destroy our alliance.

Please allow me, on behalf of the Polish government and the people's delegation, to sincerely wish you further achievements in your creative labor for the benefit of your motherland and for the benefit of peace.

We will work with you to continue to strengthen the solidarity of socialist countries, to further build socialism and to defend world peace.

Long live the great People's China!

Long live Sino-Polish friendship!

Long live the unity and friendship of socialist countries!

Long live the glorious Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong and its leaders!

Long live the friendship of the people of all countries and world peace!

### 西伦凯维兹主席的讲话

1957-04-10

专栏：

    西伦凯维兹主席的讲话亲爱的周恩来总理，亲爱的彭真市长，亲爱的同志们和朋友们，亲爱的青年们：
    今天，我站在伟大中国的光荣首都的居民面前，感到十分激动。我们感到激动首先是由于我和波兰政府和人民代表团的全体团员们能够把波兰人民对于你们的热爱和团结一致的感情直接转达给你们；并且还由于，我们知道你们的革命为你们伟大祖国六亿人民带来巨大进步，它给世界上人口最多的中国展示了伟大的远景。我们能向我们的六亿朋友的国家的首都居民讲话感到十分高兴。
    我们对你们的国家和你们的历史并不生疏。虽然在解放以前，你们和我们都是听任帝国主义强权摆布的小卒，彼此没有什么了解，但是在我们获得自由后的短短几年中互相之间已经大大地接近起来了。在第二次世界大战以前，只有波兰的进步势力才知道你们的斗争。我还记得，在法西斯主义和军国主义的浪潮正在全世界泛滥的时候，我们听到你们反抗日本军国主义的侵略和反对国内反动派的英勇斗争的消息时我们是多么地激动。我要再说一遍，当时知道你们的斗争和关心你们的斗争的只有我国社会党最进步的一些人，首先是工人阶级。但在战后，情况就完全不同了。你们争取从国民党反动派和它的外国帮凶们的桎梏下解放自己的斗争鼓舞了波兰人民。当中国人民解放军解放北京的消息传到我党的统一大会上的时候，与会的代表们的热情沸腾到了顶点，全国人民也因这一消息而感到欢欣鼓舞。
    这种同情和亲切的感情是从那里来的呢？我想主要有两个原因。第一个原因是在历史上无数次遭受外国侵略者压迫的波兰人民对于解放斗争特别敏感，并且对已经取得自由的人民满怀热情。
    第二个原因，你们在经过将近四十年斗争，久经考验的党的领导下所选择的建设社会主义和解放受到一百多年剥削桎梏的人民的道路对于我们来说是亲切的，因为那也是我们所走的道路。
    难道走这样的道路是容易的吗，是玫瑰花铺成的路吗？当然不是的。我们也有需要克服的困难。我们感谢那些批评我们并且帮助我们消除缺点的朋友们。但那些直到今天一直不承认亚洲和非洲的不久以前还受着压迫的人民已经摆脱了桎梏的事实，继续执行大炮政策，觉得现在还是十九世纪而不是二十世纪的帝国主义集团则是可笑的。
    请那些用各种形式竭力企图保持着我们这个世纪的最大羞耻——殖民主义的人不要来教训我们吧！
    在短短的不到十三年的时间里，我们已把波兰改造为一个工业化的、年产五百万吨钢和将近一亿吨煤的国家。在这个时期里，我们建立了成千上万所学校和医院，把希特勒占领者破坏殆尽的首都——华沙重建起来了。这个时期里我们加强了我们的国际地位，加强了同社会主义各国的团结，并且把曾经是充满了争端和冲突的边界改变为同苏联、德意志民主共和国和捷克斯洛伐克的和平和友谊的边界。
    在你们的国家逗留的短短几天中，我们看到了你们在共和国成立以来的七年里作了许多工作。我们亲眼看到了广州的建设，看到了古老北京的新市区，特别是看到了成千上万的快乐的孩子们。
    有些国家不承认中国的存在，正如同瞎子看不到太阳一样。看不到太阳是因为太阳不存在呢？还是因为他是瞎子呢？因为他是瞎子。
    亲爱的朋友们和同志们：
    我们是从我们曾经访问过的那些亚洲国家来到你们这里的。那些国家有着不同的社会制度和不同的发展道路。虽然有这些不同，但共同点把这些国家连结在一起，它们都曾为了自己的独立同殖民主义进行了几十年或是上百年的斗争，它们都积极地保卫和平，它们都憎恨帝国主义并努力改善近百年来由于外国的压迫而造成的落后现象。只有在这里，在亚洲我们能够亲眼看到并相信占人类半数的这些国家的人民所代表的力量是多么巨大。作为一个波兰人，我感到很骄傲，因为永远同被压迫人民团结在一起的我国人民受到了这个人类文化摇篮的古老大陆的人民的重视。作为一个共产主义者我感到骄傲，因为在社会主义改造事业中，我们同第一个社会主义国家苏联和欧洲各人民民主国家以及同伟大的中国人民是站在同一个行列里。今天中国人民正以建造建筑艺术的伟大杰作一样的智慧来为自己，为自己的伟大的国家建设着巨大的鞍钢。
    我们两国人民在社会主义建设中，在为克服今天的困难和为社会主义的继续发展的斗争中，在保卫我们的成果免遭敌对势力的野心侵略的斗争中结成了战斗的联盟。世界上没有任何力量能够破坏我们的联盟。
    请允许我代表波兰政府和人民代表团衷心地祝你们在为你们祖国的利益，为和平的利益所进行的创造性的劳动中获得进一步的成就。
    我们将和你们在一道，为继续加强社会主义各国的团结，为进一步建设社会主义和保卫世界和平而继续合作。
    伟大的人民中国万岁！
    中波友谊万岁！
    社会主义各国的团结一致和友谊万岁！
    以毛泽东同志为首的光荣的中国共产党和它的领袖们万岁！
    各国人民的友谊和世界和平万岁！
