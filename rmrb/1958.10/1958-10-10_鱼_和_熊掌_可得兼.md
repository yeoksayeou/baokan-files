    "Fish" and "Bear's Paw" Can Be Obtained Simultaneously
    Méi Ěr
    In Lianyuan County, Hunan Province, during the vigorous campaign for steel production and the harvesting of mid-season rice, a major debate arose. The theme of the debate was whether one could catch two fish with both hands, that is, whether one could simultaneously focus on both steel and grain. Some people believed that this contradiction was irreconcilable, that one must either focus on steel or focus on grain. In fact, Lianyuan County was not alone in facing this problem; other regions had similar issues.

    It seems like an undeniable truth that one cannot have the best of both worlds. Mencius said, "Fish is what I desire, and bear's paw is also what I desire; if I cannot have both, I will forsake the fish and take the bear's paw."

    Can one have the best of both worlds? Judging from many current situations, it is possible, and not just two good things, but many. If you don't believe it, there is evidence to prove it. Isn't the joint leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in our country this year an example of having the best of both worlds? In terms of agricultural production this year, it's even a case of having many good things simultaneously; aren't grain, cotton, and oil crops all having bumper harvests? Take the current steelmaking and iron smelting alongside the autumn harvest and planting as an example; it is also a case of having the best of both worlds. The newspaper reported on September 27th that the Pingyao County Party Committee in Shanxi adopted the leadership method of grasping industry with the right hand and agriculture with the left. In industry, they had already mined 15,000 tons of ore and built 130 indigenous furnaces, kilns, and blast furnaces. In agriculture, out of the county's 620,000 mu of autumn fields, more than 110,000 mu had been harvested, and they planned to plant 350,000 mu of winter wheat, with 90,000 mu already sown. Furthermore, according to the newspaper's report on October 8th, after Lianyuan County in Hunan Province implemented the policy of simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, the steel production tasks were completed very well. On September 29th, the daily output of pig iron reached 2,513 tons, and 90% of the 250,000 mu of autumn planting tasks had also been completed.

    One says it can be done simultaneously, the other says it cannot. The divergence between the two is so great; what is the reason? Is it that the objective conditions are different? Differences such as more land and fewer people, or more people and less land, cannot be said to be absolutely non-existent, but the differences are not significant, while the tension in the labor force is a common occurrence. So where is the problem? The problem lies in the greatly different subjective conditions; one sees both things and people, while the other sees things but not people. Seeing things, both sides see that after the establishment of the People's Communes, industry and agriculture are developing simultaneously and comprehensively; there are so many tasks that they are a bit overwhelmed. On the point of seeing people, the two are completely different. The former sees heroes who are vigorous, energetic, capable of piercing the sky with their heads, and capable of kicking the ground apart with their feet. Such people not only do the work of one person but can also do the work of several people simultaneously; when two people work together, they not only do the work of two people but can also do the work of dozens of people. The formula of one plus one equals two cannot be used here; here, one plus one equals three, or five, or ten... It's not just that; these people are also versatile, proficient in both literary and military skills. Farmers can not only cultivate the land but also smelt steel and iron; workers can not only smelt steel and iron but also cultivate the land; students not only study but also smelt steel and iron and cultivate the land. ... The era of each person having multiple talents, as described by Marx and Engels, has already begun in our country. With such people, can't they catch three, five, or ten fish with both hands? The People's Commune is doing just that. It not only comprehensively develops agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, but also combines industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs. The latter, although they also see people, they are not like the people described earlier; they are still enslaved by the means of production, their two hands can only catch one fish, and one person can only do the work of one person. These people are slaves to "things," not masters of "things." But such people no longer exist, or are very, very few, because they are wearing colored glasses, so what they see seems to be such people.

    It is this point that causes some people to always start from "things" when handling matters. One fish must be caught with two hands, and two fish must be caught with four hands. In this way, "fish" and "bear's paw" certainly cannot be obtained simultaneously.

    “鱼”和“熊掌”可得兼
    梅耳
    湖南省涟源县在大搞钢铁和收割中稻的时候，曾经发生了一场大辩论。辩论的主题是双手究竟能不能捉两条鱼，也就是能不能既抓钢铁又抓粮食？在有些人看来，这矛盾是不可统一的，要么大搞钢铁，要么大搞粮食。其实，不止涟源县有这样的问题，其他地区也有类似的问题。
    两美不可得兼，好像是天经地义的事情。孟子说：“鱼，我所欲也，熊掌，亦我所欲也，二者不可得兼，舍鱼而取熊掌者也。”
    两美能不能得兼？从现在的许多情况来看，可以得兼，并且不止两美，而且是多美。不信，有事实为证。今年我国的工农业生产共同跃进，不就是两美得兼吗？今年农业生产方面，还是多美得兼，粮食、棉花、油料作物不是都大丰收吗？就拿目前的炼钢炼铁和秋收秋种来说，也是两美得兼。9月27日本报报道，山西平遥县委采用了右手抓工业左手抓农业的领导方法，在工业方面已采下矿石一万五千吨，建设土炉、土窑炉、土高炉一百三十个。在农业方面，全县六十二万亩秋田，已收割十一万多亩，计划种冬麦三十五万亩，有九万亩已下种。又据本报10月8日报道，湖南涟源县在执行工农业并举方针以后，钢铁生产任务完成得很好，在9月29日这一天，生铁日产量达到二千五百一十三吨，二十五万亩秋种任务，也已完成90％。
    一曰可以得兼，一曰不可以得兼，两者分歧如此之大，原因何在？是不是两者的客观条件不同呢？地多人少，人多地少这种差别，不能说绝对不存在，但是差别不大，而劳动力的紧张情况是共同存在的。那末问题在哪里呢？就在于主观条件大大不同，一者见物又见人，一者见物不见人。见物，都看到人民公社成立以后，工农业并举，全面发展；任务一大堆，有点招架不过来。在见人这一点上，就完全不同了，前者所见到的人是生龙活虎，精力充沛，一头可以顶破天，一脚可以蹬破地的英雄好汉。这样的人，一个人不仅做一个人的事情，而且同时可以做几个人所做的事情；两个人合起来，不仅做两个人的事情，而且可以做几十个人所做的事情。一加一等于二的公式，在这里已不能使用，这里是一加一等于三或等于五或等于十……。还不仅仅是这样，这些人还都是多才多艺，文武双全。农民不仅会种地，而且会炼钢炼铁；工人不仅会炼钢炼铁，还会种地，学生不仅读书，而且会炼钢炼铁和种地。……马克思、恩格斯所说的每个人都是有多方面才能的时代，在我们国家里已经开始。有了这样的人，双手还不能捉三条鱼、五条鱼，十条鱼？人民公社就是这样做的。它不仅是全面发展农、林、牧、副、渔，而且是要工、农、商、学、兵相结合。后者，虽然也见到了人，但不是前边这样的人，而是还被生产资料奴役着的人，两只手只能捉一条鱼，一人只能做一人的事情。这些人是“物”的奴隶，不是“物”的主人。可是这样的人已经不存在了，或者很少很少了，这是因为他们戴了有色眼镜，所以见到的都像是这样的人。
    就是这一点，使有些人在处理事情的时候，总是先从“物”出发，一条鱼，一定要两只手捉，两条鱼，一定要四只手捉。这样“鱼”和“熊掌”当然不能得兼。
