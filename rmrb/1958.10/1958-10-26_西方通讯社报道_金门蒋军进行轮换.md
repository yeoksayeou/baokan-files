    Western News Agencies Report
    Chiang Troops on Kinmen Undergoing Rotation
    Xinhua News Agency, October 25th. Western news agencies report that senior military figures of the Kuomintang in Taiwan said yesterday in Taipei that the "rotation of Chiang troops" between Kinmen and Taiwan "is continuing," and that "before significantly increasing firepower on Kinmen and Matsu, there is no question of reducing the garrison on the coastal islands."
    The report said that these Chiang military figures made these remarks when discussing rumors circulating in Western news agencies that a portion of the Chiang troops on Kinmen had begun to withdraw to Taiwan. According to this claim, as an "exchange condition" for the Chiang army's "gradual and cautious" withdrawal of a portion of the Kinmen garrison, "the United States will supply certain types of weapons to enable the Kuomintang army to rapidly change its appearance and give it at least the firepower and mobility equivalent to that of the Allied forces in World War II." The report said that Chiang Kai-shek's military wants to use this "very vague guarantee" and "expect to obtain the latest 'push-button' weapons."
    It is reported that Hu Lien, commander of the Chiang troops on Kinmen, has recently taken a "long vacation" and returned to Taipei. His position as "Commander of the Kinmen Defense Headquarters" is now being held by "Deputy Commander" Ke Yuanfen. The report said that Chiang Ching-kuo visited Kinmen on the 23rd to inspect military facilities and troops.
    Xinhua News Agency, October 25th, Tokyo dispatch: The English-language "Yomiuri Japan News" published by the "Yomiuri Shimbun," when analyzing the situation of the Chiang troops on Kinmen Island, quoted a report from a foreign journalist. This foreign journalist wrote: "I often encounter situations where soldiers are unwilling to carry out the orders of their immediate superiors, and non-commissioned officers are unwilling to carry out the orders of senior officers."
    The newspaper also said that among the troops stationed on Kinmen Island, only 30% "are direct followers of Chiang Kai-shek," and 70% are residents of Taiwan who are not enthusiastic about fighting a civil war.

    西方通讯社报道
    金门蒋军进行轮换
    新华社25日讯　据西方通讯社报道，台湾国民党高级军界人士昨天在台北说，金门和台湾之间蒋军的“轮换工作现在在继续进行”，而“在金门和马祖的火力大大增加以前，根本谈不上减少沿海岛屿守军”。
    消息说，这些蒋军军方人士是在谈到西方通讯社流传的金门蒋军一部分开始撤回台湾的说法的时候说这番话的。根据这项说法，作为蒋军“逐步和谨慎地”撤退一部分金门驻军的“交换条件，美国将供应某些类型的武器，使国民党军队能够迅速改变面貌，使它获得至少相当于第二次世界大战中盟国军队的火力和机动性”。消息说，蒋介石军方想利用美国这种“很含糊的保证”，而“期望得到最新式的‘按钮’式武器”。
    据悉，金门蒋军司令胡琏最近已经请“长假”回到了台北。他的“金门防卫部司令”一职，现在由
  “副司令”柯远芬代理。消息说，蒋经国在23日曾到金门视察军事设施和军队。
    新华社25日讯　东京消息：“读卖新闻”出版的英文版“读卖日本新闻”在分析金门岛上的蒋军情况时引用了一个外国记者的报道。这个外国记者写道：“我经常碰到这样的事情：士兵不愿意执行他们顶头上司的命令，而士官不愿意执行上级军官的命令”。
    报纸还说，驻在金门岛的军队当中，只有30％的人“是蒋介石的直接追随者”，有70％是台湾的居民，他们对打内战并不感到热心。
