Mounting a Powerful Offensive, Seizing the Winter Sowing Season
Zhejiang People's Communes Establish Production Order, "Three Autumns" Work Progresses Rapidly

(Our dispatch from Hangzhou, October 11) Since the realization of people's communes in Zhejiang Province, various localities, in accordance with the instructions of the provincial Party committee, have been vigorously grasping current production, rapidly establishing the leadership core and production order of the communes, and many areas have set off a high tide of industrial and agricultural production.

After most of the people's communes in Zhejiang Province were set up, there was a short period of time when production was affected because cadres had not been assigned, new labor organizations had not been established, cultivation areas had not been divided, and winter planting plans had not been formulated. At the same time, some places relaxed agricultural production after vigorously developing steel production, failing to implement the policy of simultaneous development of industry and agriculture.

In view of the above situation, the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee requested all localities at the beginning of the month to work hard for ten days, quickly establish the production order of the people's communes, and welcome the high tide of autumn harvest and winter planting. Party committees at all levels have made urgent deployments for the work after communization according to the instructions of the provincial Party committee, and the communes have also immediately taken action.

After several days of hard work, significant achievements have been made in various localities. Most of the commune-level leadership organizations in the 104 people's communes in Jiaxing Prefecture have been established, with 576 brigade-level organizations and 4,706 production teams established, accounting for 65% of the total number of production teams. Among the Party secretaries of these 104 communes, there are six county Party secretaries and 79 county Party committee members. The cultivation areas of 4,891 production teams in the entire region have been demarcated, accounting for 67.7% of the total number of production teams. The labor organizations and cultivation areas of the people's communes in Ningbo, Taizhou, Zhoushan and other prefectures have also been largely determined, and autumn harvest and winter planting plans are being discussed in the production teams. In terms of collective welfare undertakings that have the greatest relationship with the means of production, great achievements have also been made in various localities. Zhoushan Prefecture has established 1,558 public canteens; Jinhua Prefecture has established more than 12,000 canteens, more than 11,000 nurseries and kindergartens, and a large number of sewing groups, laundry groups, and barbershops.

After the leadership core and production order of most of the people's communes were established, the superiority of the people's communes was quickly demonstrated, and the current industrial and agricultural production was rapidly promoted. The masses in Jiande Prefecture put forward the slogan "Men contract for steel, women contract for grain, ensuring that steel and grain both rise in accounts," and more than one million labor troops in the region fought day and night on the industrial and agricultural production front. This not only ensured the rapid increase in steel production, but also vigorously planted more than 100,000 mu of green manure, rapeseed, and upland wheat in two days, the 6th and 7th, and accumulated 25 million dan of various types of native fertilizers. Before the adjustment of labor organization in the Xidian People's Commune of Ninghai County, Taizhou Prefecture, 3,200 mu of mature mid-season rice was left unharvested. After the adjustment of labor organization, the labor attendance rate increased from 85% to 100%, and all the mid-season rice was harvested in three days. After the first cultivation area of the Dongpeng People's Commune in Jiaxing County established a production order, the amount of fertilizer accumulated on the first day increased by four times the daily average amount of the previous three days, and the rapeseed planting area also exceeded the sum of the previous three days.

Now, all localities are continuing to work hard to establish the production order of all communes in the shortest possible time, and to formulate autumn harvest and winter planting plans to push industrial and agricultural production to a new climax.

    摆开阵势　突击冬播
    浙江人民公社建立生产秩序，“三秋”工作进展快
    本报杭州11日电　浙江省在实现人民公社化以后，各地根据省委指示，大抓当前生产，迅速建立公社的领导核心和生产秩序，不少地区掀起了工农业生产高潮。
    浙江省的大部分人民公社在搭起架子以后，曾有一小段时间因干部没有派定，新的劳动组织没有建立，耕作区没有划分，冬种规划也没有订出，因而影响了生产。同时，还有一些地方在大搞钢铁后，放松了农业生产，没有实现工农业并举的方针。
    根据上述情况，中共浙江省委在月初要求各地苦战十天，迅速把人民公社的生产秩序建立起来，迎接秋收冬种高潮。各地党委都已根据省委指示，对公社化以后的工作作了紧急部署，各公社也立即行动起来。
    各地经过几天的苦战，已经取得了显著的成绩。嘉兴专区一百零四个人民公社的社一级领导组织，大部分已经建立起来，大队一级组织已建立的有五百七十六个，生产队已建立的有四千七百零六个，占生产队总数的65％。在这一百零四个公社的党委书记中，有六个县委书记，七十九个县委委员。全区有四千八百九十一个生产队的耕作区已经划分好，占生产队总数的67.7％。宁波、台州、舟山等专区人民公社的劳动组织和耕作区，也已大体上确定下来，秋收冬种规划正在生产队中讨论。在兴办和生产关系最大的集体福利事业方面，各地也取得了很大成绩。舟山专区已办公共食堂一千五百五十八个；金华专区已办食堂一万二千多个，托儿所、幼儿园一万一千多个，另外还办了大批的缝纫组、洗衣组和理发室等等。
    大部分人民公社的领导核心和生产秩序建立起来以后，很快显示了人民公社的优越性，迅速推动了当前的工农业生产。建德专区群众提出了“男包钢，女包粮，保证钢、粮齐升帐”的口号，全区一百多万劳动大军日夜奋战在工农业生产战线上，不仅保证了钢铁产量的迅速提高，并在6、7日两天中突击播下绿肥、油菜和山地大小麦十万多亩，积制各种土肥二千五百万担。台州专区的宁海县西垫人民公社在调整劳动组织以前，有三千二百亩成熟了的中稻没有人收割，经过调整劳动组织，劳动出勤率从85％提高到百分之百，三天内就把全部中稻抢收回来。嘉兴县东棚人民公社第一耕作区建立了生产秩序以后，第一天的积肥量就比前三天的每天平均量提高四倍，油菜播种面积也超过了前三天的总和。
    现在各地正在继续苦战，争取在最短的时间内把所有公社的生产秩序都建立起来，并且制订好秋收冬种规划，把工农业生产推向新的高潮。
