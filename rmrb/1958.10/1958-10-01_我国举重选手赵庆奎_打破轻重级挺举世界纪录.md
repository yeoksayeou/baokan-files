    Chinese Weightlifter Zhao Qingkui
    Breaks World Record in Light Heavyweight Clean and Jerk
    Xinhua News Agency, 30th - Chinese famous weightlifter Zhao Qingkui, in the celebration of National Day weightlifting performance held at the Beijing Institute of Physical Education this afternoon, broke the world record of 176 kg in the light heavyweight snatch set by American athlete George with a score of 176.5 kg.
    This is the third world record created by Chinese athletes this year after China's excellent female parachutists He Jianhua, Geng Guifang, and Cui Xiuying created the world record for parachuting, and Chen Jingkai recreated the world record for the lightest weight class clean and jerk in Leipzig in late September. It is also the fourth time that Chinese athletes have broken world records this year. So far, in the nine years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, eight people have broken nine world records (including weightlifting, swimming, women's high jump, and parachuting).
    After the clean and jerk, Zhao Qingkui immediately weighed himself on the scale in the weightlifting arena as required. After weighing, his weight was 81.8 kg, which meets the weight standards for light heavyweight weightlifters.
    The organizing committee of the competition had weighed the barbell used by Zhao Qingkui on the scale in the weightlifting arena beforehand, and the actual weight of the barbell was 176.5 kg. After the event, it was confirmed that there was no difference.

    我国举重选手赵庆奎
    打破轻重级挺举世界纪录
    据新华社30日讯　我国著名举重选手赵庆奎，今天下午在北京体育学院举行的庆祝国庆举重表演赛中，以一七六·五公斤的成绩，打破了美国运动员乔治保持的一七六公斤的轻重量级双手挺举世界纪录。
    这是今年9月下旬继我国优秀女跳伞运动员赫建华、耿桂芳、崔秀英创造了跳伞世界纪录和陈镜开在来比锡再创了最轻量级双手挺举世界纪录之后，我国运动员创造的第三个世界纪录。也是我国运动员今年第四次打破世界纪录。至此，我国建国九年来，已先后有八人打破了九次（包括举重、游泳、女子跳高、跳伞）世界纪录。
    挺举以后，赵庆奎随即按规定在举重场的磅秤上秤量体重。经过秤量，他的体重是八一·八公斤，符合轻重量级举重运动员的体重标准。
    大会裁判委员会对赵庆奎举的杠铃事前曾经过举重场的磅秤秤量过，杠铃实重一七六·五公斤，事后鉴定无差。
