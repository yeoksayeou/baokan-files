Editorial Postscript

    Grasp This Year Tightly, Prepare for Next Year

    The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's vigorous strengthening of leadership over the machinery industry is a timely and significant measure.

    The machinery industry bears the task of equipping industry and agriculture. In order to produce 10.7 million tons of steel this year, the machinery industry sector must seize the time to rush-produce a large number of complete sets of equipment for the metallurgical sector. Next year, industry and agriculture will have even greater development. Grasping the machinery industry is also a central link. For example, if we want to make steel production leap forward even better next year, we need to increase the proportion of foreign-style blast furnaces and indigenous-foreign integrated furnaces. This requires the machinery industry to start producing more metallurgical equipment as early as possible. Therefore, grasping the machinery industry is both for completing this year's task and for a greater leap forward next year.

    At present, some regions and some departments are not grasping the machinery industry tightly enough. Grasping it without tightening is equivalent to not grasping it. I hope everyone will recognize the above situation and grasp the machinery industry tightly in time.

    抓紧今年　准备明年
    中共陕西省委大力加强对机械工业的领导，是一项适时的重大措施。
    机械工业担负着装备工农业的任务。为了在今年生产一千零七十万吨钢，机械工业部门必须抓紧时间，为冶金部门赶制大批成套设备。明年，工农业要有更大的发展。抓机械工业也是个中心环节。例如，明年要使钢铁生产更好地飞跃前进，需要增加洋高炉、土洋结合的炉子的比重。这就要求机械工业及早着手生产更多的冶金设备。因此，抓机械工业既是为了完成今年的任务，也是为了明年更大的跃进。
    目前有的地区、有的部门对机械工业还抓而不紧。抓而不紧等于不抓。希望大家认清上述形势，及时把机械工业紧紧地抓起来。
