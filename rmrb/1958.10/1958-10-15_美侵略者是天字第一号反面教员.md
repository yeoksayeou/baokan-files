U.S. Aggressors Are the Number One Negative Teachers

The United States connects the global struggle against U.S. imperialism into a common struggle, creating an increasingly powerful force to bury itself.

The upcoming tenth issue of the semi-monthly "Red Flag" will publish important talks by Comrade Mao Zedong to Xinhua News Agency reporters after his inspection tour of several provinces in the Yangtze River basin in September, as well as talks during his inspection in Wuhan.

This issue of "Red Flag" also publishes Comrade Mao Zedong's poems: "Farewell to the God of Plague, Two Poems," Li Xiannian's "Observations on the People's Commune" (correspondence), Tao Lujia's "The Great Victory of the Party's Mass Line on the Iron and Steel Front," Zhao Wenfu's "The Mass Iron and Steel Smelting Movement," Fu Qiutao's "All People are Soldiers," and other articles.

The journal's commentator published an article entitled "U.S. Aggressors Serve as Negative Teachers for Us," stating that U.S. aggressors bully us but serve as negative teachers for us in various aspects. The article says: The Chinese people deeply understand the role of negative teachers from their own practical experience in long-term struggles. The people must constantly educate themselves with socialist and communist ideas and educate themselves by summarizing experiences in struggle. At the same time, the enemy's use of various means to deal with the people is an important negative teaching material for raising the awareness of the masses. The article points out that Hitler, Mussolini, Japanese imperialists, and the Tito clique are all good negative teachers for the people of the world and the Chinese people, and Chiang Kai-shek also plays the role of a negative teacher for the Chinese people. However, U.S. imperialism has inherited the mantle of all reactionaries in history and has become the "number one" negative teacher for the people of the world and the Chinese people. U.S. imperialism cultivates, subsidizes, and directs large and small reactionaries all over the world, becoming the head of all negative teachers in the world. It uses aggression and war policies as reactionary teaching materials to educate the people of the world. In this way, U.S. aggressors connect the global struggle against U.S. imperialism into a common struggle, creating an increasingly powerful force to bury themselves.

### 美侵略者是天字第一号反面教员

    “红旗”评论员发表文章论述
    美侵略者是天字第一号反面教员
    美国把全世界反对美帝国主义的斗争连结成为共同的斗争，制造了一支日益强大的埋葬自己的力量
　　新华社14日讯　即将出版的“红旗”半月刊第十期，刊登了毛泽东同志9月间巡视长江流域几个省以后，向新华社记者发表的重要谈话和在武汉视察时的谈话。
    这一期“红旗”还刊登了毛泽东同志的诗：“送瘟神二首”，李先念的“人民公社所见”（通讯），陶鲁笳的“党的群众路线在钢铁战线上的伟大胜利”，赵文甫的“群众性的炼钢铁运动”，傅秋涛的“全民皆兵”等文章。
    刊物的评论员发表了“美国侵略者给我们充当反面教员”的文章，提出美国侵略者欺负我们却在各个方面给我们充当了反面教员。文章说：中国人民从自己长期斗争的切身经验中，深深地懂得反面教员的作用。人民群众经常要用社会主义和共产主义的思想来教育自己，要在斗争中总结经验来教育自己。同时，敌人采用各种手段来对付人民，就是提高人民群众的觉悟的重要的反面教材。文章指出，希特勒、墨索里尼、日本帝国主义者、铁托集团都是世界人民和中国人民很好的反面教员，蒋介石也对中国人民起着反面教员的作用。但是，美帝国主义者继承了历史上一切反动派的衣钵，成了全世界人民和中国人民“天字第一号”的反面教员。美帝国主义者培植、接济和指挥全世界大大小小的反动派，成为全世界一切反面教员的头子。它用侵略和战争政策，作为教育全世界人民的反动教材。这样，美国侵略者就把全世界反对美帝国主义的斗争连结成为共同的斗争，制造了一支日益强大的埋葬自己的力量。
