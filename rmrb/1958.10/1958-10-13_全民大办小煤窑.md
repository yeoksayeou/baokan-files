One of the prominent problems on the steel front currently is the shortage of coal. This is true in almost all of the twenty-plus provinces and regions across the country. Southern provinces that lack coal are hoping for coal shipments from the north as eagerly as one hopes for rain during a drought. Northern provinces that are rich in coal resources also feel a shortage of coal because of increased steel production, strained transportation, and heavy tasks of supporting other regions. Yunnan, Sichuan, Hunan, and Henan provinces have relatively more resources and started focusing on coal earlier, with less external transfer tasks. However, these provinces face similarly acute coal problems. This is just the situation with coking coal. Since coking coal is currently the top priority for coal users, the situation for general industrial coal, such as coal used for locomotives and power plants, is even more critical.

Is the tight coal supply due to poor production? No. The leap forward in China's coal industry this year is unprecedented. The state originally planned to produce 210 million tons of coal this year, but now the coal industry workers are determined to complete this target half a month or a month ahead of schedule. In September, the national coal production exceeded 24 million tons, which has greatly exceeded the monthly production level of the United Kingdom.

So, what is the problem?

The crux of the problem is that the growth rate of steel production is like a sudden storm, almost doubling every month. The demand for coal is not only increasing rapidly but also needs to be stockpiled in advance. As a result, although the coal industry has developed very rapidly this year, it still lags behind the situation. In particular, the coal industry in the southern provinces is very weak. Some provinces hardly produce any coal at all, and now that the steel industry has suddenly developed greatly, the large amount of coal needed mainly relies on transportation from the north. This has created another factor of coal tension - transportation tension. Because the coal is transported from north to south, the train travels a long distance. In the coal-producing provinces in the north, it takes a long time for the cars to return, which affects the distribution of coal needed within the territory according to the plan. The steel marshal took the lead, but the two pioneers, fuel and railway transportation, did not keep up but fell behind. This is the root cause of the current tight coal supply.

This situation was not entirely unexpected. The Party Central Committee proposed doubling steel production to take steel as the key to drive the leap forward in various industrial and transportation departments. The current tight coal supply certainly brings us considerable difficulties, but at the same time, it provides us with a good opportunity for a leap forward in coal production. For us Communists, many things are forced out. In the long run, without class oppression and national oppression, there would be no class revolution and national revolution. In the near future, the leap forward in China's industry this year was, in a certain sense, forced out by the agricultural leap forward. Now that steel takes the lead, it forces other industries and transportation departments to catch up. This is called the situation forcing people. This is a good thing, not a bad thing.

So, how do we solve this problem? We know that if there is not enough coal, it will affect iron production; if iron cannot be smelted, it will affect steel production. Can we allow the coal shortage to continue, threatening the completion of the 10.7 million tons of steel task? Of course not. We must solve this problem, and we must solve it quickly.

There are ways to solve it. First of all, existing large coal mines should further increase production. These coal mines should fully mobilize the masses to tap their potential and overcome weak links. Leading cadres should go deep into production to lead production. Wherever there is a weak link, leading cadres should take the lead. Preparatory work should be strengthened. Where conditions permit, small coal mines should be built in a big way by adopting the method of "hens laying eggs" and "running satellite mines." Newly built mines should strive to put into production ahead of schedule. In this way, it is entirely possible for a greater leap forward to occur in large coal mines. Secondly, railway transportation departments should try their best to tap their potential, take measures, and strive to transport more and faster. Employees should do everything possible to improve transportation efficiency, promote the experience of Jinzhou and Changzhou, and strive to shorten the turnaround time of vehicles to about two days and shorten the time for stopping and unloading at stations to less than six hours. Shipping departments are also working hard to reduce port berthing time and strive for more coal to be transported by sea to reduce the burden on railways. After the efforts of the railway transportation departments' employees, we can expect that the transportation situation will improve in the near future.

However, these methods cannot completely solve the problem. Because, relying only on existing large coal mines, the growth of output is ultimately limited, and now iron smelting is blooming everywhere and is very decentralized. It is very difficult to supply decentralized small blast furnaces with concentrated large coal mines in terms of transportation. At present, the improvement of transportation capacity is also limited; the repair of lines and the establishment of ferries cannot be accomplished overnight. Moreover, railways and ships cannot be entirely used to transport coal. At present, the transportation of pig iron, machinery, timber, cement, grain, cotton, etc., is very urgent, and some of them are serving steel just like coking coal. Necessary and reasonable arrangements must be made for these materials in transportation.

Where is the way out? Of the thirty-six strategies, the best strategy is still to follow the path of "small, indigenous, and mass." We know that the Party's policy of "combining large, medium, and small" is applicable to all departments. We cannot imagine that the steel industry implements the policy of "small, indigenous, and mass," blooming everywhere across the country, and output increases rapidly; and the coal industry can only rely on large mines to adapt to it. The steel industry uses two legs to walk, and the coal industry must also use two legs to walk. Without relying on the entire Party and the entire people to run coal mines, the coal industry cannot catch up with the speed of the steel industry. The Ministry of Coal Industry recently proposed the slogan "soldiers against soldiers, generals against generals, using decentralized small coal mines against decentralized indigenous blast furnaces" and "wherever a thousand tons of iron are produced, ten thousand tons of coal will be produced," which should be used as a slogan for action in all regions. In particular, areas lacking coal must solve the fuel problem locally to ensure a leap forward in steel. Relying on foreign aid is unreliable. More and more places have deeply felt this point. The experience of many places has proved that adopting the policy of "small, indigenous, and mass" and mining small coal mines locally is the best, fastest, and most effective way to solve the problem. Liucheng County, Guangxi, organized 100,000 field troops and produced 86,000 tons of coal in a single day of blitz production, which is a very good example. We know that in the entire month of September, the railway department spent a lot of effort to transport 99,000 tons of coal to Guangxi. Now, in just one county, in one day, 86,000 tons were mined. It is very obvious which of the two paths is superior or inferior, whether to rely on foreign aid or self-reliance, to rely on large mines or small mines, and where to go.

By taking the path of "small, indigenous, and mass," all localities can achieve self-reliance in coal production, and any province has the conditions to do so. In the past, people always said that there was little coal in the south of the Yangtze River. Now this conclusion has completely gone bankrupt. Recently, abundant coal deposits have been discovered in Hubei, Hunan, and Zhejiang. Although no large coalfields have been discovered in other provinces, there are many scattered small coalfields. Generally, wherever there is iron, there is coal nearby. As for the conditions for opening small coal mines in the northern provinces, they are available everywhere.

However, some people now look down on small coal mines. They dislike the smallness of the indigenous mines and the low coal output. They do not understand that although a single indigenous mine produces less coal, only three to five tons a day, small mines can be opened more and faster. Baofeng County, Henan Province, rushed to dig more than 500 coal mines. In more than 20 days, the daily coal output jumped from 70 tons to more than 30,000 tons. If large coal mines were built, it would certainly not be possible to have such a large leap forward in such a short period of time. Moreover, small mines are the foundation of large mines. Now they are small, but in the future, in areas with more resources, some small ones will gradually develop into medium-sized and even large-sized ones. Now they are indigenous, and in the future, with technological reforms, they will gradually become foreign. "First use indigenous methods to get on the horse, and gradually realize mechanization," so that the coal industry can be developed in places where there was no coal industry originally.

Some people also do not advocate running small coal mines on the grounds that small mines will damage resources. This reason is also untenable. In the old society, without organization and planning, indiscriminate digging and mining sometimes inevitably caused some damage to resources. However, small coal mines are generally dug shallower, mostly mining at the outcrops or edges of coalfields, while large coal mines mainly mine in the depths. Now, the opening of small coal mines is organized and led, so it will not cause serious impact on the future expansion of coal mines.

Solving any financial and economic problem has always been approached from two aspects. One is to increase revenue, and the other is to reduce expenditure. In addition to opening small coal mines in a big way and striving for self-reliance as mentioned above, all localities should also strive to conserve coal and save transportation capacity. At present, general indigenous blast furnaces use relatively more coal. Modern blast furnaces generally only need two and a half tons of coal to refine one ton of iron; however, indigenous blast furnaces need four tons, six tons, or even eight tons or ten tons. The use of more coal is also related to the furnace type and the operation. Therefore, in order to save coal, all localities should select better furnace types that use less coal for promotion; efforts should be made to improve the output and quality of pig iron, and less sintered iron and sponge iron should be produced to relatively reduce coal consumption; and the furnace should be kept in continuous production as much as possible. Now, some indigenous blast furnaces can continuously produce for more than half a year, while some can only continuously produce for two or three days before they need to be overhauled. Cooling the furnace and then re-firing it will certainly use more coal. As for some key enterprises, modern furnaces, they should strive to change their long-standing pampered appetite and try to eat nearby coal as much as possible, and eliminate unreasonable transportation. For example, Anshan Iron and Steel still uses a considerable amount of Kailuan coal, and Wuhan Iron and Steel uses a part of Pingxiang coal from Jiangxi. In this way, the coal that is originally close to the south and more reasonable to transport to the south is transported back to the north in the midst of tight transportation. The Northeast is a region with a large production of coking coal in China. Can Anshan Iron and Steel use the coal from the Northeast nearby instead of Kailuan coal? The use of Jiaozuo, Fengfeng, and Kailuan coal by Wuhan Iron and Steel is a smooth journey from north to south. Can Pingxiang coal be avoided? At present, many steel plants still have superstitions in terms of coal use. They must use the so-called coal blending ratio to blend various types of coal from various places in a certain proportion to make coke. This makes the railway form a transport towards each other, wasting the already extremely tight transportation capacity, and also causing a lot of time and manpower waste in port loading and unloading. Now, the steel plants in Shanghai have changed this habit. Can other enterprises not change it? We think that if these enterprises are determined to break the dogma of the so-called coal blending ratio, tell the current tight coal and transportation situation to all employees, and mobilize employees to think of ways, these problems can be solved.

The situation is forcing people, the tighter it is, the more people have to strive for the upstream. The current coal shortage, the blooming of small coal mines everywhere, forcing railways and ships to be unblocked from north to south, forcing indigenous blast furnaces to improve technology, and forcing modern blast furnaces to eliminate bad habits, is a great thing. As the saying goes, "The times create heroes, and heroes create the times." In the current situation, countless heroes will emerge on all fronts; and when heroes from all walks of life dedicate their skills, the people of the whole country will see a greater leap forward in the entire industrial and transportation fronts.

### 全民大办小煤窑

    全民大办小煤窑
    当前钢铁战线上突出的问题之一是煤不够用。全国二十多个省区，几乎无一例外。南方缺煤少煤的各省，如大旱之望云霓一般在盼望着从北方运去的煤。北方盛产煤炭的各省，因为钢铁增产，运输紧张，支援外地的任务又很重，也感到用煤不足。云南、四川、湖南、河南四省，资源比较多，对煤炭抓得比较早，外调任务也不重；但是这几个省煤炭问题同样尖锐。这还只是炼焦煤的情况。由于现在对煤炭用户的“排队”是焦煤第一，因此，一般工业用煤，如机车、电站用的煤，比起焦煤来，紧张的程度就还要严重一些。
    煤炭供应这样紧张，是不是因为生产状况不妙呢？不是的。今年我国煤炭工业的跃进是空前的。国家原订计划今年生产二亿一千万吨煤，现在煤炭部门的职工决心提前半个月或一个月完成这个指标。9月份全国产煤二千四百万吨以上，已经大大超过了英国的月生产水平。
    那么，问题何在呢？
    问题的症结在于：钢铁的增产速度势如疾风骤雨，几乎每个月都要翻一番。对煤的需要量不但随之急骤增长，而且需要提前储备。结果，虽然今年煤炭工业发展得非常快，仍然落在形势的后面。特别是南方各省煤炭工业基础十分薄弱，有的省几乎根本不产煤炭，现在钢铁工业突然大大发展起来，需要的大量煤炭主要靠北方运去。这样，就造成了煤炭紧张的另一因素——运输紧张。而由于北煤南运，火车走的里程长。在北方出煤的省份，车子开走了要很久才能回来，这就影响到境内需要的煤也不能按计划输散。钢铁元帅一马当先，燃料和铁路交通这两个先行没有赶上前去，反而落在了后面，这就是当前煤炭供应紧张的根本原因所在。
    这种形势，也并不是完全没有预料到的。党中央提出钢产量翻一番，就是要以钢为纲，带动各工业交通部门向前跃进。目前煤炭供应紧张，固然给我们带来相当大的困难，但同时又为我们提供一个煤炭生产跃进的好机会。对于我们共产党人来说，许多事情是逼出来的。就远处来说，没有阶级压迫和民族压迫，就没有阶级革命和民族革命。就近处来说，今年我国工业的跃进，在一定意义上是农业跃进逼出来的。现在，钢铁一马当先，就压迫其他工业和运输交通部非赶上去不可。这就叫做形势迫人。这是好事情而不是坏事情。
    那么，这个问题怎么解决呢？我们知道，煤不够用，就要影响出铁；铁炼不出来，就要影响出钢。难道我们听任煤炭继续紧张下去，威胁着一千零七十万吨钢的任务不能完成吗？当然不能这样。这个问题我们必须加以解决，而且必须很快地解决。
    解决的办法是有的。首先，现有的大煤矿应当进一步增加生产。这些煤矿应当充分发动群众挖掘潜力，克服薄弱环节；领导干部要深入生产领导生产，哪里是薄弱环节，领导干部就在哪里挂帅；要加强准备工作；有条件的地方，要采取“母鸡下蛋”、“办卫星矿”的方式大办小煤窑；新建的矿井要努力争取提前投入生产。这样，在大煤矿中出现一个更大的跃进，是完全可能的。其次，铁路交通部门应该尽量挖掘潜力，采取措施，争取多运、快运。职工们千方百计地提高运输效率，推广锦州和常州的经验，力争把车辆的周转时间缩短到两天左右，把在车站停留装卸的时间缩短到六小时以下。海运部门也在努力减少港口停泊时间，争取更多的煤从海上走，以减轻铁路的负担。经过铁路交通部门职工这样的努力，我们可以期望，不久的将来，运输情况会有所改善。
    但是，这些办法还不能完全解决问题。因为，只靠现有的大煤矿，产量的增长终究有一定的限度，而且现在炼铁是遍地开花，十分分散。用集中的大煤矿去供应分散的小高炉，在交通运输上困难很多。目前运输能力的提高也有一定的限度；修复线、设轮渡都不能一蹴而就。何况，铁路和轮船不能全部用来运煤，目前生铁、机器、木材、水泥、粮食、棉花等等的运输都很急迫，有的且和焦煤同样是为钢铁服务的。对这些物资，必须在运输上作必要的合理的安排。
    出路在哪里呢？三十六计，还是走“小、土、群”的道路是上上计。我们知道，党的“大、中、小结合”的方针适用于一切部门。我们不能设想，钢铁工业实行“小、土、群”的方针，全国到处开花，产量急骤增长；而煤炭工业只依靠大矿就能够与之相适应。钢铁工业用两条腿走路，煤炭工业也必须用两条腿走路。不依靠全党全民来办煤矿，煤炭工业就不可能赶上钢铁工业的速度。煤炭工业部最近提出了“兵对兵、将对将，用分散的小煤窑对分散的土高炉”，“哪里生产千吨铁，哪里就搞万吨煤”的口号，这应当作为所有地区的行动口号。特别是缺煤少煤的地方，要保证钢铁大跃进，必须就地解决燃料问题，依赖外援是不可靠的。这一点，现在已经有越来越多的地方痛切地感到了。不少地方的经验证明，采取“小、土、群”的方针，就地开采小煤窑是最好、最快、最能解决问题的道路。广西柳城县组织十万野战军，一天突击生产了八万六千吨煤，就是一个很好的例子。我们知道，9月份全月，铁道部门费了九牛二虎之力，才给广西全区运去了九万九千吨煤。现在仅仅一个县、一天时间，就挖了八万六千吨。依赖外援还是自力更生，依靠大矿还是依靠小窑，两条道路孰优孰劣，何去何从，真是再明显也不过了。
    走“小、土、群”的道路，各地都自力更生搞煤炭，任何省份都是有条件的。过去人们总说江南少煤。现在这个论断彻底破产了。最近湖北、湖南、浙江都发现了丰富的煤藏，其他省份虽然没有发现大的煤田，但是分散的小块的煤田很多，凡是有铁的地方，附近一般都有煤。至于北方各省开小煤窑的条件，更是处处都有。
    但是，现在有一些人看不起小煤窑。他们嫌土窑小，出煤少。他们不了解，一个土窑虽然出煤少，一天只有三五吨，可是小矿可以开得多、开得快。河南宝丰县突击挖了五百多个煤窑，二十多天中，煤的日产量就由七十吨一跃而上升到三万多吨。要是建大煤井，肯定不可能在这样短的时间内有这样大的跃进的。而且，小窑是大窑的基础。现在是小型的，将来在资源较多的地方，一定会有些小型的逐渐发展成为中型的、甚至大型的。现在是土的，将来实行技术改革，就会逐渐变成洋的。“先用土法跨上马，逐步实现机械化”，这样就可以在原来没有煤炭工业的地方发展起煤炭工业来。
    还有一些人不主张搞小煤窑，理由是小窑会破坏资源。这种理由也是不能成立的。在旧社会，没有组织没有计划地乱挖乱采，有些时候资源难免会遭受一些破坏。但是，小煤窑一般都挖得较浅，多半在煤田的露头或边缘部分采掘，大煤井则主要在深处采掘，现在开小煤窑又是有组织有领导的，因此，对于将来煤矿的扩建不会造成严重影响。
    解决任何财政经济问题，一向从两方面着手。一是开源，一是节流。除了上面所说的大开小煤窑、力求自力更生以外，各地还应该努力节约煤炭，节约运力。现在一般的土高炉用煤都比较费。洋高炉一般的炼一吨铁只要两吨半煤；但是土高炉却要用四吨、六吨，甚至八吨、十吨。用煤多，也同炉型有关，同操作有关。因此，为了节约煤炭，各地应当选择比较好的、用煤较省的炉型加以推广；应当努力提高生铁的产量和质量，少出烧结铁和海绵铁，以相对地减少煤炭的消耗；还应当尽量使炉子不间断地生产。现在有些土高炉可以连续生产半年以上，有些只能连续生产两三天就要检修。把炉子放冷，再重新升火，煤当然要用得比较多。至于一些重点企业，洋炉子，则要努力改变一向娇惯的胃口，尽量吃就近的煤，消灭不合理运输。例如，现在鞍钢还要用相当多的开滦煤，武钢则要用一部分江西萍乡的煤。这样，就使得本来靠近南方，向南方运比较合理的煤，在运输紧张声中走回头路，向北方运。东北是我国炼焦煤生产较多的地区，鞍钢是不是可以就近用东北的煤，而不用开滦的煤呢？武钢用焦作、峰峰、开滦的煤，都是由北向南的顺路，是不是可以不用萍乡的煤呢？目前不少钢铁厂在用煤方面还存在着迷信，一定要按照所谓配煤比，把各地的多种的煤按一定比例配起来炼焦。这样便使铁路形成相向运输，浪费目前已经极为紧张的运输力，在港口装卸方面也造成很大的时间和人力的浪费。现在，上海的钢铁厂已经改变了这种习惯，难道其他企业就不能改变吗？我们想，这些企业如果下决心打破所谓配煤比的教条，把当前煤炭和运输的紧张状况告诉全体职工，发动职工来想办法，这些问题是可以解决的。
    形势逼人，逼得越紧，人就越要争上游。现在煤炭如此紧张，将小煤窑遍地开花，逼得铁路轮船南北畅通，逼得土高炉提高技术，逼得洋高炉扫除陋习，这是一件大好事。俗话说：“时势造英雄，英雄造时势”。当今之局势下，各条战线上都将会涌现无数的英雄好汉；而各路英雄齐献身手，全国人民又将会看到整个工业、运输战线上将出现一个更大的跃进局势。
