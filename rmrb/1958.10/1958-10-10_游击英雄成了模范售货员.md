    Guerrilla Hero Becomes Model Salesman
    By our correspondents Lü Suxuan, Hu Yuquan
    "Small Businessman"
    Five years ago, in the winter, Communist Party member Zhang Zhaoxin returned to his hometown – the Gao Guan Township Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Xian County, Hebei Province, to work as a salesman. This event caused surprise and criticism among the people in his hometown. Some people said to him, "You are one of the 'people who fought to win the country,' you should at least aim to be a director!" Zhaoxin just smiled and said, "Director or salesman, aren't they all doing revolutionary work? There's no high or low."

    Zhang Zhaoxin joined the revolution in 1938 and the Party in 1940. In his view, a Communist Party member should unconditionally obey the needs of the Party and the people, and for the benefit of the Party and the people, should be ready to sacrifice everything personal – even the most precious life. After 1942, when he served as the squad leader of the anti-Japanese guerrilla district and deputy company commander of the Sixth Third Regiment, he resolutely, bravely, and unpredictably struck at the enemy, making them tremble at the sound of his name. Although the enemy offered rewards everywhere for his capture, he did not waver at all, and became more courageous in battle, often infiltrating the enemy's strongholds in groups of two or three with his comrades, capturing the leading traitors, and eliminating harm for the people. After liberation, when the Party urgently needed a number of outstanding Party cadres to enrich the economic departments, he responded to the Party's call again. In 1949, he was demobilized from the army and returned home. His hemoptysis had not completely healed, and the twelve gunshot wounds all over his body still ached faintly on cloudy days. He carried his bedding to the supply and marketing cooperative to become a salesman.

    Not long after Zhang Zhaoxin became a salesman, he went to the former Jianguo County Supply and Marketing Cooperative to pick up goods and encountered a group of newly transferred cadres muttering complaints. Some said, "Now male cadres guard warehouses, and female cadres sell cloth, after making revolution all this time, we've all become small businessmen!" "Do you have the words 'small businessman' engraved on your head?" Zhaoxin said, "I think this is precisely revolutionary work!"

  A Good "Logistics Department" for Agricultural Cooperatives
    One dark night, Jiang Zhitian, the director of the Jiang Gao Guan Village Agricultural Cooperative, went out to call a meeting of cooperative members, and as soon as he went out, he saw someone pushing a cart uphill at the head of the village, pushing it halfway up and then sliding back down, doing this repeatedly. He went closer to see what it was, and it turned out to be Zhang Zhaoxin delivering four hundred catties of fertilizer to their cooperative, at a time when winter wheat sowing urgently needed fertilizer. Zhang Zhaoxin delivering goods at night was a common occurrence, because he had fought guerrillas in this area for many years, and he was familiar with every plant and tree here. In order not to delay production, he adopted three different delivery tools: usually using a cart, using a bicycle for what the farmers urgently needed; and using a carrying pole on rainy and snowy days when the roads were difficult to travel. With these three weapons, as long as the agricultural cooperative urgently needed production materials, he rushed to deliver them through wind and snow, day and night, sometimes without sleep for two or three days and nights. If he really couldn't hold on, he would lean on the cart and take a nap.

    One snowy night, Zhang Zhaoxin was pushing forty reed mats, walking on the road leading to Xu Village. As the saying goes, "Walking in snow is like walking in sand," although the load was not heavier than usual, it was very strenuous. He was covered in sweat and the cart overturned twice, covering him in mud and snow. He walked six li in an hour and a half. When he arrived at the agricultural cooperative, the cooperative cadres were in a meeting. Some swept the snow off him, and some poured him water. Wang Guitao, the director of the cooperative, said, "Brother Zhaoxin, we do need mats for digging the well, but it's not that urgent. We can use the cart ourselves to get the rest of the mats tomorrow!" Zhang Zhaoxin wanted to have the cooperative use a cart to pull them, which would involve livestock and people, and digging a well was so busy, it would delay things, so he went back and loaded another forty mats and pushed the cart to deliver them.

    "All-Rounder" Salesman
    This spring, the supply and marketing cooperative transported one hundred liberation-style waterwheels with thick pipes from Bo Town, supplying them to agricultural cooperatives in fifteen villages, including Xucun and Zhijiawu. At that time, it was precisely when the agricultural cooperatives urgently needed waterwheels to fight drought and irrigate wheat, but because the cooperative members did not know how to install and use them, they all went to the supply and marketing cooperative to ask. After Zhang Zhaoxin learned of this situation, he promptly reported it to the leading comrades of the supply and marketing cooperative. The leading comrades instructed him to quickly go to Cang County to learn how to install them and then come back to help the agricultural cooperatives install them. At that time, Zhang Zhaoxin thought: Going to Cang County to learn would take two days for the round trip, which would delay too much time. At the same time, he had seized light machine guns and grenade launchers from the enemy in the past, and although he had never seen them before, he could disassemble and assemble them by groping around. Could it be that he couldn't figure out the structure of a not-too-complicated waterwheel? So he rode his bicycle to Xiao Li Village. This village's agricultural cooperative had bought a total of ten waterwheels, and the cooperative members were guarding them, worried. He put down his bicycle and started to install them, studying and installing at the same time. After more than two hours of exploration, he finally installed one. He quickly promoted the installation experience to other villages, and one hundred waterwheels were soon turning.

  National Property Must Not Be Damaged
    Zhang Zhaoxin cherished national property more than his own body. One day in August 1956, Zhang Zhaoxin was returning from the town with goods, and the clouds in the sky became darker and darker, and a strong wind of level six or seven began to blow, and a thunderstorm began. He saw that the cart was loaded with cloth, biscuits, and paper, so he quickly took off the oilcloth he had brought and the two jackets and a single pair of trousers he was wearing and covered them on top. He himself endured the wind and rain wearing only a vest and shorts. Not far away, he saw a flood shelter made of reed mats, and an old man was there watching the embankment. He hurried over, and the old man, seeing his anxious and embarrassed appearance, quickly took down two of the three reed mats from the flood shelter and lent them to him to cover the cart. As it was getting dark, he thought that if this went on for too long, they would still get wet, so he had someone watch the goods and ran to the village. He ran from the grain store to the supply and marketing cooperative, and finally borrowed three reed mats, came back, covered the cart, and tied it firmly with ropes. Only then did a stone fall from his heart. One night in the bitter cold of December 1956, when his comrades had all gone to rest, he discovered that the one hundred and seventy hemp sacks containing salt in the supply and marketing cooperative had salt brine on them, which could easily corrode the sacks, so he broke the ice on the Hutuo River to wash the sacks, and washed more than one hundred sacks in one night.

    Zhang Zhaoxin loves commercial work. He has served the masses loyally for five years as if it was one day. He is loved by the masses, and has been selected as an advanced worker in the county and district for five consecutive years.

    游击英雄成了模范售货员

    “小买卖人”
    五年前的冬天，共产党员张召信，回到他的家乡——河北省献县高官乡供销社担任售货员。这件事引起了家乡人民的惊奇和非议。有些人对他说：“你这是‘打天下的人’，要干也得闹个主任当！”召信却笑笑说：“主任，售货员不都是干的革命工作，分什么高低。”
    张召信1938年参加革命，1940年入党。在他看来，一个共产党员应当毫无条件地服从党与人民的需要，为了党和人民的利益，应当随时牺牲个人的一切——那怕是最宝贵的生命。1942年后，他担任抗日游击队区小队长、六三团副连长时，坚决勇敢、神出鬼没地痛击敌人，使得敌人闻声丧胆。尽管敌人四处悬赏捉拿他，他也毫没动摇，并且越战越勇，经常和他的伙伴们三三两两化装深入到敌人据点里，捉拿汉奸头子，为人民除害。解放以后，当党迫切需要一部分优秀的党员干部充实经济部门的时候，他又响应了党的号召。1949年，他从部队复员回家，吐血病还没有彻底好，全身十二处枪伤遇到阴天还隐隐作痛，就扛着铺盖到供销社当售货员来了。
    张召信刚当售货员不久，一次到原建国县供销社去取货，碰到一群新调来的干部嘟嘟囔囔地讲怪话。有的说：“现在男干部守仓库，女干部去卖布，革了半天命都变成小买卖人了！”“你脑袋瓜上刻着
  ‘小买卖人’的字了吗”？召信说：“我看这正是革命工作”！
  农业社的好“后勤部”
    一个漆黑的夜晚，姜高官村农业合作社主任蒋植田找社员开会，一出门，就看见村头上有人推着车上坡，推到半截腰又退回去，如此多次。他走近一看，原来是张召信给他们社里送来了四百斤肥田粉，那时正是播种冬小麦极需肥料的时候。张召信夜间送货是经常的事，因为他在这一带打了多年的游击，他熟悉这里的一草一木。他为了不误生产，采取了三种不同的送货工具：一般情况下用小车送，农民急需的用自行车送；雨雪天道路难行就用扁担挑。凭着这三件武器，只要是农业社急需的生产资料，他就风雪无阻、昼夜不停地赶送，有时接连两三昼夜不眠不休。实在支持不住，就倚在小车上打个盹。
    一个雪花纷飞的夜晚，张召信推着四十领席，走在通向徐村的路上。俗语说：“走雪如走沙”，虽然载的货并不比往日重，但很费力气，出了满身大汗，还翻了两次车，沾了满身泥雪。六里地就走了一个半小时，到了农业社，社干部正开会，一见面有的给扫雪，有的给倒水。社主任王桂涛说：“召信哥，我们打井是需要席，但也不是这么紧，剩下的席子我们自己明天套车去拉吧！”张召信想要叫社里套车拉，又动牲口又动人，打井这么忙，多耽误功夫，于是回来又装上四十领席子推起车子送了去。
    “多面手”售货员
    今春，供销社由泊镇运来一百辆粗管的解放式水车，供应了许村、支家务等十五个村的农业社。那时正是农业社抗旱浇麦急需水车的时候，但是由于社员不会安装使用，都找到供销社询问，张召信知道这个情况后及时反映给供销社的领导同志，领导同志指示他赶快去沧县学习学习，回来帮助农业社安装，当时张召信想：去沧县学习往返路途就要两天，太耽误时间，同时，过去从敌人手里缴获的轻机枪和掷榴弹，自己虽没见过，但也能摸索着拆开装上，难道安装结构并不太复杂的水车就琢磨不出来吗？于是他骑上自行车就跑到小李村去了。这村农业社共买了十辆水车，社员正守着发愁。他放下车子就动手安装，一边研究，一边安装，经过两个多小时的摸索，终于装好了。他迅速把安装经验推广到其他各村，一百辆水车很快就转动起来了。
  国家资财不能受损失
    张召信爱惜国家资财甚过他自己的身体。1956年8月的一天，张召信从镇取货归来，越走天空的阴云越黑暗，又刮起了六、七级的大风，霹雳电闪的下起暴雨来了。他见车子上载的净是些布匹、饼干、纸张，就连忙把自己带的油布和穿的两个褂子、一条单裤，脱下来盖在上面，他自己就光穿着一件背心和裤叉忍受着风吹雨打。走了不远，他见到一个席搭的汛铺，一个老头子正在那里看堤埝。他就急忙跑过去，老头子见到他那种着急为难的样子，就忙把汛铺上的三领席子，拆下两领来借给他盖在货车上。天将黑了，他想这样时候长了，仍然会被淋湿，于是他让人看着货，向村子里跑，他从粮店跑到供销社，最后借了三领席，回来把车子盖好，并用绳子扎实，他心里的一块石头才落了地。1956年数九寒天的一个夜晚，伙伴们都休息去了，他发觉了供销社装盐的一百七十条麻袋，上边沾了盐卤，容易腐蚀麻袋，便把滹沱河的冰砸开，去洗麻袋，一夜的功夫就洗了一百多条。

    张召信热爱商业工作，五年如一日忠心耿耿地为群众服务，受到群众的爱戴，连续五年评选他为县和专区的先进工作者。
