Talking About "Working Short-Term Jobs"
Wang Pu

Currently, some cadres and Party members in counties, townships, and communes are taking a "working short-term jobs" attitude towards the steel industry. After a period of intense effort, they want to transfer their positions and "return to the fields," or they are physically at the furnace but mentally in the fields, and their enthusiasm is always low. "To pass the steel hurdle, we must first pass the ideological hurdle." To persist in the mass campaign for the steel industry, we must break this temporary "working short-term jobs" viewpoint.

The mass campaign for industry and steel production is the Party's mass line for building socialism. Why do some comrades still hold a temporary "working short-term jobs" viewpoint towards steelmaking and iron smelting? This is because these comrades have a "agriculture as the foundation" ideology in their minds. This ideology should be eliminated in the situation of accelerating the construction of socialism and preparing to gradually transition to communism. Now, the people's commune has been basically realized, and agriculture, industry, soldiers, students, and commerce have been united in the countryside. The differences between workers and peasants, between urban and rural areas, and between manual and mental labor are being gradually eliminated. In the construction of socialist industry, the policy of combining large, medium, and small enterprises with indigenous and foreign methods is aimed at achieving this ideal in a faster, better, and more economical way. It is not "agriculture as the foundation," but "industry and agriculture are both foundations." This is true for the whole country, for a province, for a county, and for a township and commune. Since both industry and agriculture are "foundations," then industry should be treated the same as agriculture. We must work hard, work year-round, work this year, work next year, and always work, and the scale should become larger and larger. Leading comrades of Party organizations at all levels must be able to lead both agriculture and industry. The debate between "working short-term jobs" or "working long-term jobs," between a temporary viewpoint and a long-term viewpoint, is essentially a struggle between giving equal importance to industry and agriculture or only giving importance to agriculture and not industry, a struggle between the mass campaign for industry and a few people running industry, and a struggle between walking on two legs or walking on one leg. In this struggle, whoever still clings to the old concept of "agriculture as the foundation" will be thrown out of the speeding train of history.

Some people say that the output of steel and iron produced by indigenous furnaces increases quickly, but it takes too much labor, and we cannot always be so "indigenous." There is some truth in this statement. Things always develop, and there is nothing in the universe that is immutable. From nothing to something, from new to old, from small to large, from low-level to high-level, is the law of development and change of all things. Now we are implementing the policy of "small and indigenous" as the main approach precisely in order to transform "small and indigenous" and improve "small and indigenous" in the future. Now that we have built more than 700,000 small indigenous blast furnaces and mobilized more than 50 million people to go to the mountains to seize the time and produce more steel and iron, it is precisely in order to reduce the number of people going to the mountains in the future and to build more "large foreign" furnaces in the future. At that time, some people will naturally "return to the fields" or transfer to other industrial sectors. It is correct to recognize this relationship between the present and the future and to work with peace of mind and actively to improve the current "small and indigenous." If we say that "small and indigenous" will definitely be transformed in the future, and therefore hold a temporary viewpoint, are half-hearted, and want to move forward but stop, then "small and indigenous" will be transformed more slowly.

Having a long-term perspective on steelmaking and iron smelting, and being determined to "work long-term jobs," only refers to the main force and backbone troops on the steel front. Among the current 50 million-strong army, some are auxiliary laborers in the crash production, who are truly temporary "short-term jobs." It is certainly incorrect to require all these people to work long-term.

There is an old saying in our country: "Those who understand the times are outstanding." The current "times" are to give equal importance to industry and agriculture, to have the mass campaign for industry, and the mass campaign for steel. Since the Party has placed us on the steel front, we should wholeheartedly lead the masses and fight to the end with perseverance.

    谈“打短工”
    王朴
    现在，有些县、乡、社的干部和党员同志，对于搞钢铁工业抱着“打短工”的态度，在突击一阵之后，就想转移阵地，“解甲归田”；或者身在炉边，心在田里，干劲老是不高。“要过钢铁关，先过思想关”，要坚持全民办钢铁工业，不破这种“打短工”的临时观点是不成的。
    全民办工业、全民炼钢铁是党建设社会主义的群众路线的方针，为什么有些同志对炼钢、炼铁仍然抱着“打短工”的临时观点呢？这是因为在这些同志的脑子里，有着一个“以农为本”的思想。这一思想在加速建成社会主义并准备逐步向共产主义过渡的形势下是应当打消了的。现在，人民公社化已经基本实现，农村工农兵学商已经合一，工农差别，城乡差别，体力劳动与脑力劳动的差别正在努力逐步消灭。在建设社会主义工业中，采取大、中、小型企业并举、土洋结合的方针，目的也就是为了多快好省地实现这个理想。不是“以农为本”，而是“工农皆本”。全国如此，一省如此，一县如此，一乡一社亦如此。既然工业农业都是“本”，那么对待工业也就应当像对待农业一样，必须大干，长年干，今年干，明年干，永远都要干，而且越干规模越大。各级党组织的领导同志，必须既会领导农业，又会领导工业。所谓“打短工”还是“打长工”，是临时观点还是长期观点的争论，实质上是工农并举还是只举农不举工的斗争，是全民办工业还是少数人办工业的斗争，是两条腿走路还是一条腿走路的斗争。在这个斗争中，谁仍然抱着“以农为本”的老观念不放，谁就会被抛出飞驰着的历史列车的外边去。
    有人说，土炉炼钢、土炉炼铁，产量增加得是快，就是花的劳动力太多，不能永远这样“土”下去。这句话有道理。事物总是要发展的，宇宙间没有一成不变的东西。从无到有，从新到老，从小到大，从低级到高级，就是一切事物发展变化的规律。现在我们实行以“小土”为主的方针，正是为了将来变革“小土”，提高“小土”。现在我们搞起了七十万多座小土高炉，动员五千多万人上山，争取时间，多产钢铁，正是为了将来不再用这么多的人上山，为了将来建设更多的“大洋”炉子。那时候，自然会有一部分人要“解甲归田”，或者转到别的工业部门去。认识到这个现在与将来的关系，安心地并且积极地搞好目前的“小土”，这是正确的态度。说“小土”将来一定要转化，因而就抱着临时观点，三心二意，欲前又止，那“小土”就越转得慢。
    炼钢炼铁要有长期观点，要决心“打长工”，这只是指钢铁战线上的主力军、基干部队说的。在现在的五千多万大军中，有些是突击生产中的辅助劳动，真正是临时性的“短工”。要求这些人一律长期干下去，当然也是不对的。
    我国有句古话，叫做“识时务者为俊杰”。如今的“时务”就是工农业并举，全民办工业，全民办钢铁。党把我们摆在钢铁前线，我们就应当一心一意，领导群众，百折不挠地奋战到底。
