Vigorously Develop Private Libraries
Hu Yaohui

    The recent news of many provinces and cities vigorously developing private libraries is very encouraging. This is a very noteworthy new issue and a new task that requires bold experimentation. The development of private libraries has opened up new avenues for the development of China's library cause. It is an important part of China's library network and is of great significance for realizing the great popularization of culture.

    The establishment of private libraries is one of the specific manifestations of many places learning the General Line, breaking superstitions, liberating their minds, and daring to think and act. Today, under the situation of great development in China's industry, agriculture, culture, education, and science, it is far from enough to rely solely on the state to run libraries. So, how to solve this increasingly obvious contradiction? There are two ways to solve it: one is to rely entirely on the state, but this method is not only slow but also impossible, because the state's financial resources are limited at present. For the long-term interests of the people of the whole country, the state's investment must first ensure the construction of industry and agriculture, and too much money cannot be spent on library undertakings. This is a very simple principle. The other way is for the state to run some libraries and mobilize the masses to run some collectively, combining state-run libraries with private libraries. In this way, the development of China's library cause will progress rapidly. This method can greatly reduce and gradually solve the contradiction between the people's increasingly urgent need to learn political, cultural, and production technology knowledge and the insufficient number of libraries.

    According to the situation and experience of various places in establishing private libraries, especially the experience of Tianjin, as long as the Party committee takes the lead, fully relies on the masses, and uses the manpower, materials, and financial resources of the masses, private libraries can be developed quickly.

    However, private libraries, like the growth of other new things, are not smooth sailing, and they have encountered ideological resistance from the "wait-and-see" faction. They say that there is a lack of activists, young and educated people are already employed, and other people will not manage library work; some people think that running a library requires a decent building, and the source of books is difficult to solve; others say: "Running cultural undertakings is different from running factories and schools, and it may not be good for the masses to run them collectively." In addition, some people worry that the masses do not understand "library science" and cannot run it well, and they are afraid of losing books. In short, the above-mentioned people have many concerns about private libraries and do not believe in the wisdom and strength of the masses. The successful facts of the collective establishment of libraries by the masses in Hebei District of Tianjin and many other places have powerfully refuted this conservative view.

    Manpower, houses, books, and funds, etc., can be solved one by one as long as we follow the mass line, run libraries diligently and thriftily, open our doors to run libraries, and implement the policy of serving politics and production. How can those who think that running a library requires a separate building accept the suggestion enthusiastically put forward by an old woman to run the library on her kang? How can those who think that a library cannot be established without the state spending money to buy books think of many practical and feasible methods as soon as they discuss it with the masses? Is there no one to do library work? Not only is there, but everyone can do library work and do it very well, delivering books to those who need them. Before you think about or haven't thought about what books to read, the books have already been delivered. What should those who shout that you can't run a library well if you haven't studied "library science" think about this?

    The Party proposed that the whole people run industry and the whole people run all undertakings. The library cause is a part of the entire socialist construction cause. It is impossible to imagine that every corner of the country from south to north and from east to west is carrying out economic and cultural construction in a vigorous manner. If library work is still only done by a small number of library staff, the development of the library cause will not be able to truly leap forward, and it will not be possible to be a promoter of the technological revolution and the cultural revolution. Therefore, in the development of the library cause, we must also learn to walk on two legs. Not only should we do a good job in state-run library work, but at the same time, we should boldly experiment with private libraries under the principle of voluntary participation by the masses according to the specific conditions of various places. Once experience is gained, it should be immediately promoted. We must achieve what Hunan Province proposed: "Every township should have a private library," and what Hebei District of Tianjin proposed: "Every residents' committee should have a private library or even more." It should be pointed out that at present, only a very small number of provinces and cities are doing this work relatively quickly and well. Most provinces, cities, and districts have not paid enough attention to this work. It is hoped that in the work of developing private libraries, we must catch up with the spirit of learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced.

    大力发展民办图书馆
    胡耀辉
    最近许多省市大搞民办图书馆的消息，是非常令人振奋的。这是一个十分引人注意的新问题和需要大胆试验的新工作。民办图书馆的发展，给我国图书馆事业的发展开辟了新的道路，它是我国图书馆网的一个重要的组成部分，对实现文化大普及具有重大意义。
    举办民办图书馆，是许多地方经过总路线学习，破除迷信，解放思想，敢想、敢干的具体表现之一。今天在我国的工业、农业、文化、教育和科学事业大发展的形势下，仅仅依靠国家举办图书馆是非常不足的。那么，如何解决这个愈来愈明显的矛盾呢？解决的办法有两个，一个是完全依靠国家来办，这个办法不仅是慢而且不可能，因为目前国家的财力有限，为了全国人民的长远利益着想，国家的投资首先是要保证工农业的建设，在图书馆事业上花钱还不能太多，这个道理是很简单的。另一个办法是国家办一些，发动群众也集体办一些，把国家办的与民办的结合起来，这样，我国图书馆事业的发展就会一日千里。这一办法，就可以使广大人民群众日益迫切需要学习政治、文化和生产技术知识的要求和图书馆数量不足的矛盾大大缩小和逐步解决。
    根据各地兴办民办图书馆的情况和经验，特别是天津的经验来看，只要党委挂帅，充分依靠群众，运用群众的人力、物力、财力，民办图书馆就可以很快发展起来。
    但是，民办图书馆，也像其他新事物成长一样，不是一帆风顺的，它遭到了“观潮派”的思想抵触。他们说，积极分子缺乏，年青有文化的人都已经就业，其他的人不会管理图书馆工作；有些人认为办图书馆就得有一幢像样的房子，图书的来源问题不好解决；还有人说：“办文化事业不同于办工厂，办学校，由群众集体办恐怕不大好”。另外，还有人担心群众不懂“图书馆学”，办不好，怕丢书。总之，上述这些人对民办图书馆顾虑重重，不相信群众的智慧与力量。天津市河北区和其它许多地方群众集体举办图书馆成功的事实，有力地批驳了这种保守的看法。
    人力、房子、图书和经费等等，只要走群众路线，勤俭办馆，开门办馆，贯彻为政治、为生产服务的方针，就可以逐一解决。那些认为办图书馆非要一座单独房子不可的人，怎能接受一个老大娘热情地提出的要把图书馆办在她家的炕头上的建议呢！？那些认为非国家出钱买书就不能办起图书馆来的人，怎能想到同群众一商量就想出许多切实可行的好办法？！是不是没有人来做图书馆工作呢？不仅是有，而且是人人都能做图书馆工作，做得非常好，把书送到需求者的手边，你想到或者还没想到要看什么书，书已经送来了。这对于那些叫喊没有学过“图书馆学”就不能办好图书馆的人来说，该怎样想呢？
    党提出全民办工业，全民办一切事业。图书馆事业是整个社会主义建设事业的一个组成部分，不能设想，全国从南到北、从东到西的每一个角落都在轰轰烈烈地大搞经济、文化建设，如果图书馆工作还只是靠为数极少的图书馆工作人员来办，图书馆事业的发展就不可能真正的大跃进，就不可能做技术革命和文化革命的促进派。因此，在图书馆事业的发展上也必须学会两条腿走路，不仅要搞好国家办的图书馆工作，同时，应该根据各地的具体情况，在群众自愿的原则下，大胆地试验民办图书馆。一旦取得经验就立即加以推广，要做到像湖南省提出的：“要乡乡有民办图书馆”，天津市河北区提出的：“要每个居民委员会都有民办图书馆或者更多一些”。应该指出，目前这个工作只有极少数省、市搞得比较快，比较好，大多数省、市、区对这一工作还没有引起足够的注意，希望在发展民办图书馆的工作上，要以学先进、赶先进的精神迎头赶上去。
