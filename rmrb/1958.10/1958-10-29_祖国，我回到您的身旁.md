    Motherland, I Return to Your Side
    Written by: Volunteer Soldier Heng Zhongquan, Organized by: Chen Weiming
The train speeds swiftly across the Yalu River, rushing across the vast fields of our beloved motherland. The scenery is good on both sides of the railway, so good! Green hills, clear waters, white clouds, and blue skies, red flags flutter in the wind, crops stretch into a continuous expanse, reaching as far as the eye can see, factories rise everywhere, chimneys reach high into the sky. Beloved motherland, beloved homeland, I have thought of you day and night for eight years of separation, and now I return to your side.

        ×××
The motherland soars on the east wind, Volunteer soldiers come to sing your praises. The construction of the motherland is like the sun in the east, illuminating the hearts of the Volunteer soldiers. The wind of the motherland blows on us, refreshing our spirits; the water of the motherland tastes sweet in our mouths; the high mountains of the motherland smile at us; the rivers of the motherland sing joyfully to us. Motherland, homeland! I have thought of you day and night for eight years of separation, and now I return to your side, to forever be the most beloved person, forever fighting in the place where the motherland needs me most!
