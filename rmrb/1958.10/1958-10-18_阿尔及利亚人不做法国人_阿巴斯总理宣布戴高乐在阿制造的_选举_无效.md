    Algerians Will Not Become French
    Premier Abbas Declares De Gaulle's "Elections" in Algeria Invalid

    Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, October 17th: Algerian Republic Provisional Government Premier Abbas said during an exclusive interview with a Xinhua News Agency reporter on the evening of the 16th: "The Algerian people declare that the so-called elections that De Gaulle is about to impose on Algeria are as invalid as the results of the so-called referendum."

    He criticized De Gaulle's so-called "overall" policy, saying: "This policy will lead to its own destruction because it is against nature." He said: "De Gaulle will not succeed because he cannot turn Algerian Arabs into French people."

    Abbas said: "We have experienced more than a hundred years of struggle, and we firmly believe that Algeria will rebuild a nation for itself. We also believe that history will once again prove that no country belongs to those who colonize it, but to the people who live in that country."

    Abbas said that everyone knows that the referendum manufactured by De Gaulle was held under the supervision of the French armed forces. He said: "When a referendum was held on the French Fourth Republic in 1946, France did not ask Algerians to vote. At that time, the French themselves admitted that Algerians were not French."

    Abbas asked: "But why are we being asked to vote after four years of war? Everyone can clearly see that De Gaulle's aim is to make the Algerian people abandon the achievements they have gained from the struggle for independence."

    Speaking about the prospects for the Algerian people's struggle, he said that his government would step up military activities, supply the National Liberation Army with more weapons, and call on all peace-loving and freedom-loving people in the world to help the Algerian people.

    When asked about the Algerian government's foreign policy, Abbas replied: "Our current policy is to seek the assistance we can find for the Algerian struggle. We are loyal to the United Nations Charter, the Declaration of Human Rights, and the Bandung Principles." Abbas concluded by saying that the friendly relations between Algeria and China can currently be strengthened by maintaining contact between the governments of the two countries.

    阿尔及利亚人不做法国人
    阿巴斯总理宣布戴高乐在阿制造的“选举”无效
    据新华社开罗17日电　阿尔及利亚共和国临时政府总理阿巴斯在16日晚上单独接见新华社记者时说：“阿尔及利亚人民宣布，戴高乐即将强加给阿尔及利亚的所谓选举是同所谓公民投票的结果一样，都是无效的”。
    他斥责戴高乐的所谓“整体”的政策说：“这个政策将招致自身的毁灭，因为这是违反自然的。”他说：“戴高乐不会得到成功，因为他不可能把阿尔及利亚的阿拉伯人变为法国人。”
    阿巴斯说：“我们经历了一百多年的斗争，我们深信阿尔及利亚将重新为自己建立一个国家，我们还认为历史会再一次证明，任何一个国家都不会属于那些对它进行殖民统治的人，而是属于生活在那个国度里的人民。”
    阿巴斯说，所有的人都知道，戴高乐制造的公民投票是在法国武装部队的监督下举行的。他说：“当1946年对法兰西第四共和国进行公民投票的时候，法国并没有要求阿尔及利亚人投票。当时法国人自己也承认阿尔及利亚人不是法国人。”
    阿巴斯问道：“但是，在经过四年的战争以后，为什么要求我们投票呢？所有的人都可以明白地看出，戴高乐的目的是要阿尔及利亚人民放弃他们从独立斗争中取得的成果。”
    他在谈到阿尔及利亚人民的斗争的前景时说，他的政府将加紧进行军事活动，供给民族解放军更多的武器，并且要求世界上所有爱好和平和自由的人民帮助阿尔及利亚人民。
    在记者问到阿尔及利亚政府的外交政策时，阿巴斯回答说：“目前我们的政策是为阿尔及利亚的斗争寻求我们所可能找到的援助。我们忠于联合国宪章、人权宣言和万隆原则。”阿巴斯最后说，目前，阿尔及利亚和中国之间的友好关系，可以通过保持两国政府之间的接触的办法予以加强。
