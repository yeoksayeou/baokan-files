The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to launch a mass writing movement throughout the province with the theme of "Singing Praises of the Great Leap Forward, Recalling the History of the Revolution," planning to produce ten million works. This writing movement is of a grand scale and magnificent spirit, and is very encouraging. It should be said that this is not only a major event in the cultural revolution of Hebei Province, but will also influence the whole country. It not only reflects the achievements of Hebei Province in mass literary and artistic work, but also marks the formation of a mass line for developing socialist literature and art with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and the arrival of a vigorous cultural revolution upsurge.

The "Singing Praises of the Great Leap Forward, Recalling the History of the Revolution" mass writing movement will undoubtedly play a more extensive role in promoting mass literary and artistic creation, because it proposes that one can write about the present or the past; one can express the new people and new events in the socialist Great Leap Forward, or recall the heroic and moving history of revolutionary struggle. New and old contrast, all-round blooming. This creative movement itself is also a process of mass self-education, greatly inspiring the socialist enthusiasm of the masses. At the same time, the creative gains will also play a broad and profound educational role for the vast number of readers.

In developing literary and artistic creation through the mass line, Hebei Province has specifically implemented the policy of literature and art closely serving politics. Many county committees, while arranging the central work, requested the cooperation of literary and artistic creation, mobilized the masses, and promptly compiled and launched publicity activities. Therefore, almost all mass literary and artistic works vividly reflect the central tasks of the time and place: when building reservoirs, there were folk songs about building reservoirs; during drought resistance and planting, there were quick-patter rhymes encouraging active drought resistance and planting; works criticizing the backward and praising the advanced appeared frequently in the garden of mass creation. These works promptly inspired the labor enthusiasm of the masses, promoted the development of central work, and closely cooperated with the current political tasks.

In carrying out mass literary and artistic creation activities, Hebei Province has also correctly resolved the relationship between popularization and improvement, and has truly achieved what Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: improvement on the basis of popularization, and popularization under the guidance of improvement. First, conduct large-scale popularization, and through exhibitions, poetry contests, blackboard newspapers, mimeographed publications and all available tools, promote layer by layer, and recommend layer by layer, and then improve the writing ability of the masses through observation and evaluation, and roving guidance. In order to balance the development of mass literary and artistic creation throughout the province, the Hebei Provincial Committee and the provincial cultural authorities have also held many on-the-spot literary and artistic conferences in areas with advanced mass literary and artistic creation activities. For example, the on-the-spot conference of amateur poetry writers held by the Hebei Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles in Nanshuiquan Village, Huailai County in May this year, the literary and art theory work conference convened by the Provincial Committee in July and August, the creation conference of worker amateur writers convened by the Tianjin Municipal Committee, and the on-the-spot conference of mass literary and artistic creation convened by the Provincial Bureau of Culture in Shulu County, have all enabled advanced experience to be disseminated in a timely manner. Through discussion, amateur authors clarified some important issues in creation, gained a lot of improvement, and consolidated their continuous enthusiasm for creation, which strongly promoted the development of mass literary and artistic creation activities.

Here, it is particularly worth mentioning two active measures taken by the Hebei Provincial Committee that are very beneficial to the national literary and artistic work:

Regarding the cultivation of creative backbones. Hebei Province's key cultivation of creative backbones has completely changed the past practice of only valuing articles and not people, and requires three good qualities for creative backbones: good politics, good production, and good creation. The first requirement is good politics and good production, and the second is good creation. Only in this way can we guarantee their backbone role among the masses and guarantee the good publicity and mobilization effect of their works among the masses (because only people with good politics and good production have prestige among the masses). This is an important lesson learned from the anti-rightist struggle. In the past, some units lacked such a clear class line in the cultivation of literary and artistic workers, which allowed some class alien elements to take the opportunity to seize positions and fame that were completely incompatible with them, and stir up trouble in the literary and artistic circles. This experience should become the development direction for the cultivation of literary and artistic workers throughout the country. Because only by adhering to such a clear class line can we build a socialist literary and artistic team and maintain the purity of this team.

Secondly, regarding literary and artistic criticism. Hebei Province has adopted measures to actively carry out mass criticism, using mass criticism to drive and help the healthy development of mass creation. In particular, in combination with cadre study, it put forward the instruction of combining "studying theory, writing articles, and guiding work," and called on cultural and propaganda leading cadres at all levels to become the backbone of literary and artistic theory work. This is a very meaningful measure for the development of Marxist literary and artistic theory. In the past, some leading cadres in literary and artistic work focused on grasping administrative affairs, and had a tendency to neglect in-depth ideological and theoretical work. It is precisely because of this neglect that revisionists have the conditions to stir up trouble and plant white flags everywhere. If our literary and artistic leading cadres can grasp the work of literary and artistic theory, it will be possible to quickly establish a strong and organized socialist literary and artistic theory team that is both red and expert, and promote the development of Marxist literary and artistic theory. On this issue, leading cadres of literary and artistic work at all levels must liberate their minds, break superstitions, give full play to the spirit of learning while writing, and must firmly grasp this red flag in their own hands. It should be understood that literary and artistic theory, like all other theories, is not an ivory tower, but a summary and improvement of literary and artistic practice. Leading cadres of literary and artistic work at all levels have rich practical experience in life, literary and artistic practice, and literary and artistic work. As long as they break the mysterious view of literary and artistic theory, they can not only write excellent critical articles, but also creatively develop Marxist literary and artistic theory. Hebei Province's measure is worthy of serious consideration by the leaders of literary and artistic work in various places.

Our great motherland is in an era of riding the wind and breaking the waves, galloping, and leaping forward. The technological revolution and the cultural revolution have been vigorously launched throughout the country. The main content of the cultural revolution is to break the concept of bourgeois cultural monopoly. In literature and art, it is to make literature and art become the literature and art of the workers and peasants, to make the workers and peasants have their own literary and artistic authors, and to truly combine literature and art with the working people. This is a serious struggle. To achieve a complete victory in this struggle, we can only rely on the Party, rely on the broad masses of working people, extensively carry out mass literary and artistic creation movement, break the shackles of all conservative ideas and mysterious concepts, seize this fortress, and make the literary and artistic cause the cause of the whole Party and the whole people. Hebei Province has first made a good example. We believe that there must be many more such examples in other places. Party committees at all levels should summarize experience in a timely manner and promote it, in order to promote the rapid launch of mass literary and artistic creation and criticism movement.

### 要抓紧领导群众文艺工作

    要抓紧领导群众文艺工作
    中共河北省委决定在全省范围内开展“歌颂大跃进，回忆革命史”的群众写作运动，计划要写作一千万件。这个写作运动规模宏大，气魄雄伟，是非常振奋人心的。应该说，这不仅是河北省文化革命中的一件大事，而且也将影响全国。它不仅反映了河北省的群众文艺工作的成绩，也标志了多快好省地发展社会主义文学艺术事业的群众路线已经形成，轰轰烈烈的文化革命高潮已经到来。
    开展“歌颂大跃进，回忆革命史”的群众写作运动，无疑地会对群众文艺创作起到更广泛的推动作用，因为它提出的是：既可以写现在，又可以写过去；既可以表现社会主义大跃进中间的新人新事，又可以回忆可歌可泣的革命斗争历史。新旧对照，全面开花。这个创作运动本身，也就是群众自我教育的过程，大大地鼓舞群众的社会主义热情。同时，创作上的收获，也将对广大读者起到广泛而深刻的教育作用。
    在通过群众路线发展文艺创作的活动里，河北省具体地贯彻了文艺密切为政治服务的方针。许多县委都是在布置中心工作的同时，就要求文艺创作的配合，发动群众，及时编写展开宣传活动。因此，几乎所有的群众文艺作品，都生动地反映着当时当地的中心任务：修水库就流传着修水库的民歌；抗旱点种，就有鼓励积极抗旱点种的快板；批评落后，表扬先进的作品，更是经常地出现在群众创作的园地里。这些作品都及时地鼓舞了群众的劳动热情，推动了中心工作的开展，紧密地配合了当前的政治任务。
    在开展群众文艺创作活动中，河北省也正确地解决了普及和提高的关系，真正做到了毛泽东同志所指出的：在普及的基础上提高，在提高的指导下普及。首先是进行大普及，通过展览会，赛诗会，黑板报，油印刊物等一切可以利用的工具，层层推广，层层推荐，然后再通过观摩评比，巡回辅导，提高群众的写作能力。河北省委和省的文化机关，为了使全省群众文艺创作的发展平衡起来，也曾经在群众文艺创作活动先进的地区举行过多次文艺现场会议。像今年5月间河北省文联在怀来县南水泉村举行的业余诗歌作者现场会议，7、8月间省委召开的文艺理论工作会议，天津市委召开的工人业余作者创作会议，省文化局在束鹿县召开的群众文艺创作现场会议，都使得先进经验及时地得到了传播。通过讨论，业余作者在创作上明确了一些重要的问题，得到了不少提高，也巩固了创作上的持续的热情，有力地推动了群众文艺创作活动的发展。
    在这里，特别值得提出的，是河北省委对于全国文艺工作都非常有益的两项积极措施：
    关于创作骨干的培养。河北省对于创作骨干的重点培养，完全改变了只重文章不重人的做法，对创作骨干要求三好：政治好、生产好、创作好。首先是要求政治好、生产好，其次才是创作好。只有这样才能保证他们在群众中间的骨干作用，保证他们的作品在群众中间宣传鼓动的良好效果（因为只有政治好、生产好的人，在群众中间才有威信）。这是从反右斗争中吸取的一个重要教训。过去，某些单位在文艺工作者的培养工作上，缺乏这样明确的阶级路线，才使得一些阶级异己分子乘机夺去了完全和他们不相称的名位，在文艺界兴风作浪。这个经验应该成为全国培养文艺工作者的发展方向。因为只有坚持这样明确的阶级路线，才能建立起社会主义的文学艺术队伍，也才能保持这支队伍的纯洁性。
    其次，关于文艺评论工作。河北省采取了积极开展群众评论，用群众评论带动和帮助群众创作健康发展的措施。特别是结合干部务虚，提出了“学理论，写文章，指导工作”三点结合的指示，号召各级文化、宣传领导干部成为文艺理论工作的骨干。这是一项对于马克思主义文艺理论的发展非常有意义的措施。过去，有些文艺工作的领导干部，偏重于抓行政事务，存在着忽视深入地做思想、理论工作的偏向。正是由于这种忽视，才使得修正主义者有条件兴风作浪，到处插白旗。如果我们的文艺领导干部都能够抓紧文艺理论工作，就会使一支又红又专有组织的坚强的社会主义文艺理论队伍有可能迅速地建立起来，促进马克思主义文艺理论的发展。在这个问题上，各级文艺领导干部都必须思想解放，打破迷信，发挥边写边学的干劲，必须把这面红旗牢固地掌握在自己的手里。要知道文艺理论也像其他一切理论一样，并不是空中楼阁，而是文艺实践的总结和提高，各级文艺领导干部都有丰富的生活实践，文艺实践，文艺工作实践，只要打破对于文艺理论的神秘观点，不但能写出很好的评论文章来，而且完全有可能创造性地发展马克思主义文艺理论。河北省的这项措施，值得各地文艺工作的领导者的认真考虑。
    我们伟大的祖国正处在乘风破浪、万马奔腾、飞跃前进的时代，技术革命和文化革命已经在全国范围内蓬勃展开。文化革命的主要内容，就是打破资产阶级文化垄断的观念。在文艺上就是要使文艺成为工农自己的文艺，使工农有自己的文艺作者，使文艺真正和劳动人民相结合，这是一场严重的斗争。要使得这场斗争取得彻底胜利，只有依靠党，依靠广大劳动人民，广泛开展群众性的文艺创作运动，打破一切保守思想和神秘观念的束缚，夺下这个堡垒，使文艺事业成为全党全民的事业。河北省首先做出了好的榜样，我们相信，别的地方像这样的榜样一定还很多，各级党委应该及时地总结经验加以推广，以推动群众文艺创作和批评运动的迅速发动。
