Bumper Harvest of Flue-Cured Tobacco: Break Old Habits
Hasten Research on Deep Plowing, Quality, Topdressing, and Early Planting

Flue-cured tobacco production is also leaping forward this year, with total output tripling compared to 1957 and exceeding the United States' 1957 production of 8 to 10 million dan. In the past, flue-cured tobacco generally yielded 140-150 jin per mu, with a maximum of no more than 849 jin; this year, the general yield is 400-500 jin per mu, and counties with yields of 1,000 jin per mu and "satellite fields" with yields of 10,000 jin per mu have also begun to emerge. Due to the leap in production, past cultivation technology viewpoints have also been shaken.

Flue-cured tobacco has always been considered a "shallow cultivation crop," but the Great Leap Forward has shattered this view. This year, Henan Province's tobacco was plowed 1.5 to 2.5 chi deep, resulting in denser plants and larger leaves than in previous shallow cultivation. Next year, they plan to plow even deeper, generally 3 chi, or even 5 chi. However, deep plowing is very labor-intensive, and labor has always been tight in tobacco-growing areas. This raises a question for agricultural scientists: How deep should tobacco fields be plowed for optimal and most economical results?

How to balance tobacco yield and quality is also a question. In the past, it was believed that a yield of around 600 jin per mu could guarantee quality. This year, it seems that yields of 1,000 to 2,000 jin per mu can also guarantee quality, but ensuring the quality of yields of 10,000 jin per mu is difficult and should be studied quickly.

Another question is whether to advocate for early tobacco or late tobacco. To increase production, we must find ways to increase leaf thickness and quantity. Based on this year's situation, finding ways to increase the number of leaves is the main direction, but this requires extending the growing season, and it seems that late tobacco is limited in terms of growing season. In the past few years, we emphasized late tobacco. Which is better is also a question worth studying.

Then there is the issue of dense planting. Past experience has shown that dense planting leads to "bottom curing," resulting in a significant loss of yield and quality. Therefore, tobacco areas in Henan, Shandong, and other provinces do not exceed 2,000 plants per mu. This year, this has also been broken. Guizhou Province planted 3,000 to 5,000 plants per mu, with the most reaching 18,000 plants, as dense as Zhejiang's yellow hemp, and no "bottom curing" occurred. Their "satellite fields" this year are proposing to plant more than 40,000 plants per mu. This raises the question: How to topdress? Can fertilizer be applied all at once without the need for further topdressing?

I believe that flue-cured tobacco scientists should go to the actual production with the farmers to solve various scientific theoretical problems.

    烤烟大增产　大破老习惯
    应赶快研究深耕、质量、追肥和种早烟的问题
    戈福元
    烤烟的生产今年也在大跃进，总产量比1957年增加了三倍，将超过美国1957年产量的八百至一千万担的产量。以往，烤烟一般亩产一百四、五十斤，最高也不过八百四十九斤；今年一般亩产四、五百斤，而亩产千斤的县和亩产万斤的卫星田也已露出苗头。由于生产跃进，也就动摇了过去的栽培技术观点。
    烤烟一向被认为是“浅耕作物”，大跃进打破了这种看法。河南省的烤烟今年就耕了一点五尺到二点五尺，结果比以往浅耕的植株密，叶片大。明年他们计划要耕得更深，一般将是三尺，甚至到五尺。可是深耕很费劳力，而在烤烟区劳力又一向是很紧张的，这就给农业科学工作者提出了一个问题：烤烟地究竟翻多深合适和经济效果最大？
    烤烟的产量与品质如何兼顾也是一个问题。过去认为亩产六百斤左右，可以保证质量。今年看来，亩产千斤到两千斤的，也可以保证质量，可是亩产万斤的，保证质量就有困难，应该赶快研究。
    还有一个问题，就是提倡搞早烟好还是提倡搞晚烟好？要增产，就要想法增加叶片的厚度和数量。根据今年情况看，设法增加叶片数量是主要方向，但这样就得延长生长期，看来搞晚烟在生长期上就受到限制。而在前几年我们是强调搞晚烟的。倒底怎样，也是一个值得研究的问题。
    再就是密植的问题。过去的经验是密植了要“底烘”，产量、质量大受损失，因而河南、山东等烟区每亩都不超过二千株。今年这一条又给打破了。贵州省每亩植到三千到五千株，最多的到一万八千株，密如浙江的黄麻，也没有发生“底烘”的问题。他们今年的“卫星田”则提出每亩要植四万多株。这就提出一个问题：如何追肥？肥料可否一次施足而不再追？
    我认为烤烟科学工作者应该和农民一道到生产实际中去，解决各种科学理论问题。
