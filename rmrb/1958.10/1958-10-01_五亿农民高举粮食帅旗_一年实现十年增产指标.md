Xinhua News Agency, 30th: Reporter Li Yi reports: Summer and autumn grain crops such as wheat, rice, and early autumn corn have generally had bumper harvests. Root crops and southern late rice, and northern late autumn crops, which will soon be harvested, also show signs of bumper harvests. This year, China's grain has achieved a comprehensive bumper harvest, with a total output reaching an unprecedented record of over 700 billion jin. This is a leap in production of about double compared to the total grain output of 1957 (370 billion jin).

A universal bumper harvest is the characteristic of this year. The total sown area of the four major categories of grain crops in China—wheat, rice, miscellaneous grains, and root crops—amounted to over 1.8 billion mu. None of these crops failed to increase production, and no province or region failed to increase production. This year's practice has proven that there are no low-yield crops in our country. Any grain crop this year has seen a large number (not just a few individual cases) of "thousand-jin mu" and astonishing high-yield records. It is estimated that the national area of various grain crops with a per-mu yield of over 1,000 jin is about 100 million mu.

Wheat, which was always considered a low-yield crop, has become a high-yield crop this year. The total output of nearly 400 million mu of winter wheat and spring wheat reached 80 billion jin, an increase of approximately 70% compared to last year, surpassing the United States. The national area of wheat fields with a per-mu yield of over 1,000 jin is about 1.5 million mu. The average per-mu yield of wheat in fifty-five counties and cities exceeded 400 jin, twenty-nine counties and cities exceeded 500 jin, and eight counties exceeded 600 jin, 700 jin, and 800 jin respectively. In Gansu Province, the average per-mu yield of wheat in Hezheng and Dunhuang counties exceeded 1,000 jin. The per-mu yield of winter wheat in the high-yield fields of Xiping County, Henan Province, reached 7,320 jin, and the per-mu yield of spring wheat in the high-yield fields of Saishike Farm in Qinghai Province reached 8,585 jin.

This year's increase in rice production is even more rapid and forward-moving. The nation's 140 million mu of early rice yielded a total of over 87 billion jin of rice, an increase of 125% compared to last year (38.7 billion jin). It is estimated that over 150 million mu of intermediate rice will yield over 113 billion jin of rice, an increase of over 40% compared to last year. Among the rice already harvested this year, the average per-mu yield in the five provinces and cities of Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, Hubei, and Shanghai exceeded 1,000 jin. There were 115 early-rice "thousand-jin counties and cities", many of which were "two-thousand-jin" and "three-thousand-jin" counties and cities. It is worth mentioning that Dancheng County in Henan Province, which planted rice for the first time this year, achieved an average per-mu yield of 5,000 jin for the entire county. According to statistics, about 15 million mu of early rice across the country yielded over 1,000 jin. Intermediate rice has also seen a large number of "thousand-jin mu" and "thousand-jin counties". Initially, the three special districts of Changde, Hengyang, and Qianyang in Hunan Province reported an average per-mu yield of over 1,000 jin for intermediate rice. Counties with an average per-mu yield of 2,000 jin or 1,000 jin for intermediate rice include Langxi, Huaining, and Yuexi in Anhui; Honghu, Xiaogan, and Jianli in Hubei; and Pixian, Xinfan, and Xindu in Sichuan; Gaoyou, Baoying, Xinghua, and Taixian in Jiangsu. The 96 mu of intermediate rice already harvested by the Hongri People's Commune in Huanjiang County, Guangxi, achieved an average per-mu yield of 17,000 jin, a high-yield "satellite" over a large area.

Miscellaneous grain crops such as corn, millet, and sorghum have also had unprecedented bumper harvests this year. Early autumn crops have now been harvested in most areas, and a large number of "thousand-jin mu" have appeared in both the south and the north. In Inner Mongolia and the Northeast, beyond the Great Wall, records of 1,000 jin and 2,000 jin per mu have been reported for sorghum, corn, and millet. In Shandong Province alone, there were 22,556 mu of corn, millet, and sorghum with a per-mu yield of over 5,000 jin; there were thirty-four "thousand-jin" counties and cities for corn, twenty "thousand-jin" counties for millet, and one "thousand-jin" county for sorghum. In Shouzhang County, 11,064 mu of corn had an average per-mu yield of 4,814 jin, and 52,345 mu of millet had an average per-mu yield of 6,028 jin. The average per-mu yield of millet in Fan County was 5,000 jin. In addition, Gaocheng and other counties in Hebei Province, Changge and other counties in Henan Province, Huaian and other counties in Jiangsu Province, and Yanhe County in Guizhou Province are all "thousand-jin corn" counties.

Root crops not only have a larger sown area than last year, but the proportion of yield increase will exceed that of all grain crops this year. Currently, most of the root crops across the country have not yet been harvested, but the per-mu yield of those that have already begun to be harvested is mostly over 10,000 jin.

The total grain output in most parts of the country this year has basically achieved the targets set for 1967 in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft). Agricultural production is growing at a 100% high speed, which is a miracle unprecedented in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad.

The comprehensive bumper harvest of grain is a great victory achieved by our country's socialist construction in 1958, and it is a victory for the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism.

    五亿农民高举粮食帅旗
    一年实现十年增产指标
    据新华社30日讯　记者黎益报道：小麦、水稻和早秋玉米等夏秋粮食作物已经普遍丰收，不久即将收获的薯类作物和南方晚稻、北方晚秋也呈现一片丰收景象，今年我国粮食获得了全面的大丰收，总产量将达到七千亿斤以上的空前纪录。这比1957年的粮食总产量（三千七百亿斤），跃进增产了一倍左右。
    普遍大丰收是今年的特点，今年全国小麦、水稻、杂粮、薯类四大类十几种粮食作物的播种面积共十八亿多亩，这些作物没有一种没有增产，也没有一个省区没有增产。今年的实践证明我国没有低产作物，任何一种粮食作物今年都出现了大量的（不是个别的）千斤亩，出现了惊人的高产纪录。据估计：今年各种粮食作物亩产在千斤以上的全国共达一亿亩左右。
    一向被认为低产的小麦今年成了高产作物，近四亿亩冬麦和春麦等总产量达到八百亿斤，比去年增产约70％以上，超过了美国。亩产量达到千斤以上的小麦丰产田全国约有一百五十万亩。有五十五个县市的小麦平均亩产量超过了四百斤，二十九个县市超过了五百斤，八个县分别超过六百斤、七百斤和八百斤；甘肃省和政、敦煌两县，今年全县小麦的平均亩产量超过了一千斤。河南省西平县的冬麦高产田亩产高达七千三百二十斤，青海省赛什克农场的春麦高产田亩产高达八千五百八十五斤。
    今年水稻的增产更是突飞猛进，一往直前。全国一亿四千多万亩早稻共收稻谷八百七十多亿斤，比去年（三百八十七亿斤）增产125％。一亿五千多万亩中稻，估计可收稻谷一千一百三十亿斤以上，比去年增产40％以上。今年全国已经收获了的稻谷，平均亩产千斤以上的有河南、安徽、江苏、湖北、上海五个省市，一百一十五个早稻千斤县市，其中还有许多二千斤，三千斤的县市。值得特别一提的是河南省郸城县，郸城今年新种水稻，全县亩产平均就达到了五千斤。全国出现的一千斤以上的早稻据统计约一千五百万亩。中稻也出现了大量的千斤亩和千斤县。最初报来的有湖南省常德、衡阳、黔阳三个专区的中稻平均亩产千斤以上。中稻平均亩产二千斤或一千斤的县安徽有郎溪、怀宁、岳西等县，湖北有洪湖、孝感、监利等县市、四川有郫县、新繁、新都等县市，江苏有高邮、宝应、兴化、泰县等县。广西环江县红日人民公社已收的九十六亩中稻平均亩产达一万七千斤，是大面积的高产卫星。
    玉米、谷子、高粱等杂粮作物今年也空前丰收。现在各地早秋多已收获完毕，南方北方都出现了大量的千斤亩。长城以外的内蒙古和东北，高粱、玉米和谷子都出现了亩产一千斤和二千斤的纪录。仅山东省亩产在五千斤以上的玉米、谷子和高粱就有二万二千五百五十六亩；玉米千斤县市有三十四个，谷子千斤县有二十个，高粱千斤县有一个；寿张县玉米一万一千零六十四亩，平均亩产四千八百一十四斤，谷子五万二千三百四十五亩，平均亩产六千零二十八斤。范县全县谷子平均亩产五千斤。此外，河北省藁城等县、河南省长葛等县、江苏省淮安等县、贵州省沿河县都是玉米千斤县。
    薯类作物不仅播种面积比去年大，而且单产提高的比例将超过今年一切粮食作物。现在，全国大部地区的薯类都还没有收获，部分已开始收获的亩产多在万斤以上。
    今年全国大部地区的粮食总产量，基本上实现了农业发展纲要（修正草案）所规定的1967年的指标。农业生产以百分之百的高速度增长，这是古今中外没有过的奇迹。
    粮食全面大丰收是我国社会主义建设在1958年取得的一个伟大的胜利，是党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的胜利。
