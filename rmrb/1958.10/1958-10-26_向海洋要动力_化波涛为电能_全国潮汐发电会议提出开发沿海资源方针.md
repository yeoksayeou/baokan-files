Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, October 25th: Seeking power from the ocean, transforming waves into electricity, and developing China's abundant coastal tidal resources to serve the accelerated socialist construction of the country. The Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power and the Chinese Academy of Sciences held the first National Tidal Power Conference in Shanghai from the 17th to the 23rd to study this issue.

China has a long coastline with abundant tidal power resources. According to preliminary estimates based on existing survey data, the usable tidal resources are approximately 35 million kilowatts or more. After the development of the world-renowned Qiantang River estuary, the installed capacity can reach more than 7 million kilowatts, with an annual power generation of approximately 10 to 20 billion kilowatt-hours. For coastal provinces, tidal energy is a realistic and feasible important energy source for developing the power industry. Since April of this year, in the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, various localities have been building small tidal power stations using tidal rivers to meet production needs. For example, Guangdong Province has built small tidal power stations in fifteen counties, thirteen of which have already generated electricity, and seventeen are under construction. After the completion and commissioning of the Daliang Tidal Power Station in Shunde County, towel, printing, and fertilizer factories that previously operated manually have been converted to machine production. Silkworm farming sideline production has also increased by one season. In addition to power generation, there are comprehensive benefits such as fish farming and irrigation. The income in the first year after completion can exceed five times the total investment, which is very satisfying to the masses. This single county plans to build 300 small tidal power stations next year. Shandong, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Fujian and other places are also actively carrying out pilot construction of tidal power stations. The masses have used their own practice to break the mysterious concept of tidal power generation.

In view of the fact that tidal power generation is a new undertaking, the conference determined that the current policy for this work is: "Develop small-scale vigorously, pilot medium-scale, and actively study large-scale." Small-scale tidal power stations have great benefits, relatively simple technology, and are easy for the masses to master. They can be mainly run by communes, further summarized and improved on the existing basis, vigorously promoted, and universally developed. For medium-sized tidal power stations, priority should be given to selecting locations with easier engineering, smaller investment, electricity needs, and greater returns for pilot projects, creating models and accumulating experience for promotion. Large-scale tidal power stations should adopt a policy of active preparation and full reliability, further collecting data and carrying out experimental research work. Putting politics in command and relying on the masses are the keys to building tidal power stations in a faster, better, and more economical way. Small-scale power stations should especially rely on the masses to use indigenous methods to replace foreign ones and rely on their own efforts to solve the difficulties of insufficient materials, equipment, and facilities. Coastal provinces and cities should immediately conduct a general survey of coastal tidal power resources, understand the situation, and propose potential development targets.

The units participating in the meeting also determined the main research projects for 1958-1959 and organized extensive collaboration. The meeting decided that the Guangdong Provincial Department of Water Resources and Electric Power should take the lead, and the Shanghai Survey and Design Institute of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power should organize the Shanghai Mechanical and Electrical Manufacturing and related universities and scientific research units to form a joint working group. At the beginning of next month, they will go to Shunde, Guangdong to summarize the experience of local small tidal power stations and complete the typical design of small tidal power stations within the year.

### 向海洋要动力　化波涛为电能  全国潮汐发电会议提出开发沿海资源方针

    向海洋要动力　化波涛为电能
    全国潮汐发电会议提出开发沿海资源方针
    新华社上海25日电　向海洋要动力，化波涛为电能，把我国沿海蕴藏丰富的潮汐资源开发出来，为加速国家的社会主义建设服务。水利电力部和中国科学院17日到23日在上海召开第一次全国潮汐发电会议，研究了这个问题。
    我国海岸线很长，潮汐动力资源十分丰富。根据现有勘测资料初步估计，可以利用的潮汐资源约在三千五百万瓩以上。世界闻名的钱塘江河口开发后，装机容量可达七百多万瓩，每年发电量约达一、二百亿度。对沿海各省来说，潮汐能是发展电力工业的现实可行的重要能源之一。从今年4月开始，在工农业生产大跃进中，各地为了生产的需要，已经纷纷利用潮水河建设小型潮汐电站。例如，广东省已有十五个县兴建小型潮汐电站，十三处已经发电，十七处正在施工。顺德县大良潮汐电站建成发电后，使过去用手工操作的毛巾、印刷、肥料工厂都改由机器生产，养蚕副业生产也增加了一期，除发电外，还有养鱼、排灌等综合效益，建成后第一年的收入即可超过投资总数的五倍，群众十分满意。单这一个县明年就准备建设三百个小型潮汐电站。山东、上海、江苏、福建等地也都积极进行潮汐电站的试点建设工作。群众已经用自己的实践打破了对潮汐发电的神秘观念。
    鉴于潮汐发电是一项新的工作，会议确定当前这项工作的方针是：“小型大力发展，中型进行试点，大型积极研究”。小型潮汐电站由于效益大、技术比较简单，易为群众掌握，可以社办为主，在现有的基础上进一步总结提高，大力推广，普遍发展。中型潮汐电站要首先选择工程较易、投资较小、用电需要、收益较大的地方进行试点，创造典型，积累经验，以便推广。大型潮汐电站应采取积极准备、充分可靠的方针，进一步搜集资料，开展试验研究工作。政治挂帅，依靠群众，是多快好省地建设潮汐电站的关键。小型电站更要切实依靠群众以土代洋，自力更生，来解决物资、器材、设备不足的困难。沿海各省市要立即普查沿海潮汐动力资源，摸清情况，提出可能开发的对象。
    参加会议的各单位，并确定了1958—1959年主要研究项目，组织了广泛的协作。会上决定，以广东水利电力厅为主，同时由水利电力部上海勘测设计院组织上海机电制造及有关大专学校、科学研究单位成立联合工作组，在下月初赴广东顺德总结当地小型潮汐电站的经验，在年内完成小型潮汐电站的典型设计。
