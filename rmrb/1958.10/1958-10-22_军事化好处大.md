Militarization is Great
Yangquan Miner Zhang Wen

I am a worker in Team 3 of No. 1 Mine of Yangquan. Since Team 3 implemented militarization, it has brought me great benefits. Before the implementation of militarization, eating at home was either too early or too late. The children cried and the adults shouted, making it impossible to get water or soup. Now that militarization has been implemented, as soon as the whistle blows, we get up and go to the cafeteria to eat ready-made meals.

Speaking of work and study, there are also many benefits. Now, as soon as the whistle blows, we go to school together, and we can debate when problems arise. The benefits are really not small. Comrade Lao Ma, who is literate, often reads the newspaper to everyone, and we can know about major national affairs!

    军事化好处大
    阳泉矿工　张汶
    我是阳泉三矿一号三队的工人，自从三队实行了军事化以后，给我带来了很大好处。实行军事化以前，在家里吃饭，不是过早了，就是太晚了，小孩啼大人叫，闹得喝水没水，喝汤没汤。现在实行了军事化，只要哨子一吹、就起身到食堂里吃做好的现成饭。
    要说工作学习方面，好处也不少。现在只要哨子一吹，一起上学，发生问题时还可以辩论，好处可真不小。有文化的老马同志还常给大家念报，国家大事都能知道啦！
