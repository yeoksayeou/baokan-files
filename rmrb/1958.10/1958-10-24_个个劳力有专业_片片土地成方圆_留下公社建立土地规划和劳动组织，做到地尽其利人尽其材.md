    Every Laborer Has a Specialization, Every Plot of Land Becomes Square and Round
    Liuxia Commune Establishes Land Planning and Labor Organization to Maximize Land Use and Human Talent
    (According to Zhejiang Daily) After setting up its framework, the Liuxia People's Commune in Hangzhou City prominently grasped the crucial links of dividing cultivation areas, making land planning, and establishing labor organizations, thus quickly putting production on the right track.
    
    Members Demand Land Planning
    The Liuxia People's Commune was established by merging four townships and forty-one small cooperatives. The entire commune has 27,861 mu of paddy fields, including 7,895 mu of interspersed fields, accounting for 28.34%. For example, the more than 600 mu of fields in the Yangjiapailou Cooperative were distributed in 37 *fan*, the distant ones being more than 20 *li*, and the near ones also being four or five *li*. This unreasonable and scattered distribution of cultivated land made the contradiction with the high-speed development of production very prominent.
    
    After the establishment of the commune, since the land of several townships was owned by the commune, it created extremely favorable conditions for rational land adjustment. After the framework of the commune was set up, some cadres and members went to the commune several times a day to demand that land planning be carried out quickly. Before the commune made arrangements, the first company of the Xianlin Brigade automatically exchanged more than 80 mu of fields with Wanyang Township in Yuhang County. This shows that quickly doing a good job in land planning and establishing labor organizations is not only the urgent demand of the members, but also the primary link for the commune to quickly establish a production order.
    
    Great Debate, Great Breakthrough
    Although the vast majority of cadres and members actively supported and sincerely welcomed land planning, there were still various personal considerations in the division of land, the matching of land and labor, and the division of various work projects, such as: ① Requesting to divide less land and allocate more, so that labor is not intensive and work is easy. ② Requesting to allocate bad land out and allocate good land in, so that there will be more production increase in the future, with rewards and glory. ③ Small cooperatives that originally operated more tea and vegetables requested to allocate paddy fields out and only grow vegetables. Because of this, there were "disputes over good and bad" and "disputes over quantity" when dividing land. When establishing labor organizations, there were "disputes over backbone" and "disputes over labor." When establishing specialized teams, there were "disputes over projects." Some members were unwilling to go to the rice team, thinking that rice production was hard work and not as enjoyable as growing vegetables or roasting tea. Therefore, in carrying out land planning and establishing labor organizations, it is necessary to hold high the red flag of communism, greatly promote communism, greatly destroy individualism and departmentalism, and establish the idea of "one for all, all for one." The Liuxia People's Commune organized cadres and the masses to thoroughly debate three questions: What are the benefits of land planning? What attitude should be taken in land planning and establishing labor organizations? What principles should be grasped? Organize extensive general discussions, group deliberation, and individual heart-to-heart talks. In the debate, when talking about the benefits of land planning, they also recalled the various difficulties brought to production in the past when the cooperatives were small and the land was scattered and fragmented. In this way, they more concretely realized the unparalleled superiority of the commune. After the debate, the members generally believed that as long as the land is divided squarely and neatly, it does not matter if it is divided more or worse.
    
    A struggle was launched against some ideas that only sought personal and partial interests, ignoring collective interests. Shan Jixian, the leader of the fourth company of the Xianlin Brigade, took the lead in competing for good land and labor, and also believed that he represented the interests of the masses. The Party branch launched an ideological struggle from within and outside the Party against his erroneous thinking. In the debate, the members exposed that the reason why he wanted to compete for good land was to make it easier for the members to support him. Miao Xianglin, the leader of the fifth company of the Xianlin Brigade, profoundly examined his idea of competing for glory in the debate, wanting less, better, and closer fields, stronger cadres, and more labor. He said: The result of doing so has three harms: disharmony between companies; poor land planning; and members not being at ease. Therefore, he expressed that he would obey the leadership, make overall plans, and ensure everyone's bumper harvest. Originally, 50 mu of bad land was allocated to the fifth company, but he did not want it. After the debate, he happily accepted it.
    
    Beneficial to Production, Beneficial to Unity
    The fundamental purpose of implementing land planning and establishing labor organizations is to promote the continuous development of production. Therefore, when carrying out land planning, it must be done in a way that is beneficial to production and beneficial to unity, with full debate and everyone being satisfied. In specific work, the commune grasped the following five principles: ① It should be convenient for the five transformations (mechanization, electrification, specialization, water conservancy, transportation), with a long-term vision and great ambition; ② It should be connected in nearby plots, with interspersed fields becoming complete plots and distant fields becoming nearby fields; ③ Land, agricultural work, and labor should be roughly adapted; ④ Take care of the original situation and make appropriate adjustments; ⑤ Ensure a smooth handover between the old and new, clarify responsibilities, and avoid disrupting production. The establishment of brigades (battalions) and production teams (companies) is based on the principle of maintaining the original situation and making appropriate adjustments, with reference to the continuous land plots and the size of natural villages. A brigade has about 1,000 households, and a production team (company) has about 100 households, taking into account the original living conditions. The advantage of doing so is that it is convenient for leadership and beneficial to production.
    
    Land planning and the establishment of labor organizations are carried out simultaneously. Generally, the company-level first establishes the organization, and then the land is divided to the company according to the size of each company. When dividing land, tea fields, fish ponds, water ponds, and mulberry fields are rationally matched. Those who originally focused on tea cultivation are allocated more tea fields, those who originally focused on rice cultivation are allocated more paddy fields, and other crops are also grown concurrently. In addition to handicraft companies, commercial companies, and logistics companies, company-level generally consists of comprehensive companies. At the team-level, all are built into specialized teams for rice, tea, vegetables, sericulture, fisheries, logistics, animal husbandry, etc., implementing division of labor. When establishing specialized teams, the following principles are generally grasped: ① Allocate people according to their technical expertise to make the best use of their talents; ② Match labor according to production needs; ③ Take care of women, the elderly, the weak, and the disabled, with women being mostly assigned to logistics, vegetable growing, and tea picking; ④ Elderly people over 60 years old work voluntarily. In this way, everyone can truly show their expertise and get what they need.
    
    Formulate Winter Planting Plan to Strive for a Greater Leap Forward
    After three days of vigorous mobilization and hard work, the Liuxia People's Commune has basically completed the work of dividing land and establishing labor organizations. In this way, the situation of scattered and fragmented land for thousands of years has been completely changed. There are no longer any interspersed fields between communes, brigades, and production teams. The original 333 small *fan* in the entire commune have now been merged into 124 large *fan*. In the past, the distant ones were more than 20 *li*, but now the most distant ones are only three or four *li*. It is estimated that the entire commune can save more than 180,000 workdays in agricultural production after adjusting the land. Therefore, regardless of men, women, old, or young, they are all rejoicing and truly see the greater superiority of the commune compared to the advanced cooperative. They said: The commune is really good, every laborer has a specialization, and every plot of land becomes square and round. In particular, the women members used to have to cross three bays and four ridges to pick tea, but now they can pick it as soon as they go out. Because of the continuous land plots, the members' confidence and determination to achieve a greater leap forward in production have been further encouraged. Some want to run specialized training classes on a company-level basis, and some want to launch various high-yield "satellites." Now the commune has turned to formulating winter planting plans, preparing for winter planting, and striving for a greater harvest in next year's production.

    个个劳力有专业　片片土地成方圆
    留下公社建立土地规划和劳动组织，做到地尽其利人尽其材
    据浙江日报消息：杭州市留下人民公社在搭起架子后，突出地抓住划分耕作区、做好土地规划和建立劳动组织这一首要环节，从而使生产迅速走上正轨。
    社员要求规划土地
    留下人民公社是由四个乡、四十一个小社合并建立起来的。全社共有水田二万七千八百六十一亩，其中有插花田七千八百九十五亩，占28.34％。如杨家牌楼社的六百多亩田，就分布在三十七个畈里，远的二十多里，近的也有四、五里。这种耕地布局不合理、零星分散的状况，与高速度发展生产的矛盾显得非常突出。
    公社建立后，由于几个乡的土地都为公社所有了，就给合理的调整土地带来了极为有利的条件。有些干部、社员在公社的架子搭起来后，就一天几次的跑到公社里来要求赶快规划土地。闲林大队第一连在公社没有布置以前，就自动的和余杭县万杨乡调了八十多亩田。这说明，迅速搞好土地规划和建立劳动组织，不仅是社员的迫切要求，也是当前使公社迅速建立起生产秩序的首要环节。
    大争大辩　大破大立
    虽然绝大部分干部和社员对土地规划是积极拥护、竭诚欢迎的，但是在土地的划分、土地和劳力的搭配、各种工作项目的分工上，仍有种种个人打算，如：①要求土地少分进点，多划出点，这样劳动不紧张，干活轻松。②要求把坏地划出去，好地划进来，将来增产多，有奖励、又光荣。③原来多经营茶叶、蔬菜的小社，要求水田划出去，光种蔬菜。由于这样，在划分土地时就有“好坏之争”“多少之争”。在建立劳动组织时，就有“骨干之争”“劳力之争”。在建立专业排时，就有“项目之争”，有的社员不愿到水稻排里去，认为搞水稻生产辛苦，不如种蔬菜、炒茶叶来得快活。因此，在进行土地规划和建立劳动组织中，必须高举共产主义红旗，大立共产主义，大破个人主义、本位主义，树立起“我为人人，人人为我”的思想。留下人民公社组织干部、群众辩透三个问题：土地规划有什么好处？在土地规划和建立劳动组织中应抱什么态度？掌握什么原则？组织广泛的大会讨论，小组酝酿，个别交心。在辩论中，谈到土地规划的好处，也回忆了过去小社时由于土地分散、零星给生产上带来的种种困难。这样，就更使他们具体的体会到公社的无比优越。经过辩论，社员普遍认为只要把土地划得方、划得整，就是划得多点、划得坏点也没关系。
    对一些只图个人利益、局部利益，不顾集体利益的思想展开了斗争。闲林大队第四连连长单继贤，带头争好地，争劳力，还认为自己是代表群众的利益。党支部就针对他这种错误思想从党内到党外展开了思想斗争。在辩论中，社员揭穿了他所以要争好地，是为了好使社员拥护他。闲林大队第五连连长缪祥林在辩论中，深刻的检查了自己的争光荣的思想，田要少些、好些、近些，干部要强些，劳力要多些。他说：这样做的结果有三个害处—连与连之间不团结；土地规划搞不好；社员不安心。因此，他表示要服从领导，要全面打算，要大家丰收。原来有五十亩坏田划给第五连，他不要，辩论后，就愉快的接受下来了。
    有利生产　有利团结
    实行土地规划，建立劳动组织的根本目的是为了促进生产的不断发展。因此，在进行土地规划时，总的必须做到有利生产，有利团结，充分辩论，大家满意。在具体工作中，该社掌握了以下五条原则：①要便于五化（机械化、电气化、专业化、水利化、交通化），眼光要远，志气要大；②要就近连片，插花田变整片，远田变近田；③土地、农活和劳动力要大体适应；④照顾原有，适当调整；⑤新旧交接，明确责任，生产不乱。至于大队（营）、生产队（连）的建立，是根据以原有为主、适当调整的原则，参考土地连片与自然村大小情况进行划分。大队一千户左右，生产队（连）一百户左右，照顾原有居住条件。这样做的好处是既便于领导，又有利生产。
    土地规划与建立劳动组织是同时进行的，一般是连一级先建立组织，再根据每个连的规模大小，将土地划分到连。在划分土地时，做到茶地、鱼塘、水塘、桑地合理搭配，原来以经营茶叶为主的，就多划给茶地，原来以经营水稻为主的，就多划给水田，同时，兼营其他作物。连一级除了手工业连、商业连、后勤连外，一般多是综合连。排一级，全部是建成水稻、茶叶、蔬菜、蚕桑、渔业、后勤、畜牧等专业排，实行分工分业。在建立专业排时，一般掌握以下原则：①根据每人技术特长，做到人尽其才；②根据生产需要，搭配劳力；③照顾妇女和老弱、残疾，妇女多分配做后勤、种蔬菜、采茶工作；④六十岁以上的老年人劳动自愿。这样，就真正做到人人各显专长，个个各得其所。
    制订冬种规划  争取更大跃进
    留下人民公社经过三天的大动员、大苦战，划分土地和建立劳动组织工作已基本上结束了。这样，就彻底改变了几千年来土地零星分散的状况，公社与公社、大队与大队、生产队与生产队之间已经不再有插花田，全公社原来有三百三十三个小畈，现在并成了一百二十四个大畈，过去远的有二十多里，现在最远的只有三、四里了，估计全社在调整土地后，就可以在农业生产上节省十八万多工。因此，不论男女老幼，都是欢欣鼓舞，真正看到了公社比高级社更大的优越性。他们说：公社真正好，个个劳力有专业，片片土地成方圆。特别是妇女社员，过去采茶要翻三湾过四岗，现在一出门就可以采了。由于土地的连片，就更加鼓舞了社员实现生产更大跃进的信心和决心，有的要以连为单位，大办专业学习班，有的要大放各种高产“卫星”。现在该社已转入制订冬种规划，准备冬种，争取明年生产的更大丰收。
