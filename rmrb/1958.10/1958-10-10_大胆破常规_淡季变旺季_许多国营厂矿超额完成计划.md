Daring to Break Conventions: Transforming the Off-Season into Peak Season
Many State-Owned Factories and Mines Exceed Production Plans

Hanoi, Vietnam — Most of the state-owned factories and mines in Vietnam have broken the conventions of past off-season production and exceeded their production plans for the third quarter. Many factories and mines, while exceeding their plans, also reduced costs.

The third quarter is typically the off-season for industrial production in North Vietnam. During this quarter, fluctuating weather conditions often severely affect the production of factories and mines. However, this year, workers displayed a high degree of enthusiasm, and many factory and mine leaders went deep into the grassroots to work alongside workers, pooling their wisdom and efforts, finally solving difficulties that had been unresolved for many years, enabling factories to continue production regardless of wind or rain. At the beginning of July this year, the Cam Pha Mining Area Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party, together with the workers, organized production inspection teams, earnestly discovered and solved problems existing in production, and fully mobilized the broad masses of employees to participate in the "Autumn and Winter Production Campaign," encouraging technological innovation and strictly managing machinery. Therefore, they overcame previously unsolvable difficulties, enabling production to develop further.

    大胆破常规　淡季变旺季
    许多国营厂矿超额完成计划
    越南大部分国营厂矿打破了过去淡季生产的常规，超额完成了第三季度的生产计划。好些厂矿在超额完成计划中，还降低了成本。
    第三季度在越南北方通常是工业生产上的淡季。在这个季度里，常常由于气候变化无常，厂矿的生产情况受到严重的影响。但是，今年工人们发挥了高度的干劲，同时许多厂矿领导干部深入下层同工人一起劳动，群策群力，终于解决了多年来所不能解决的困难，使工厂能够风雨无阻地继续生产。今年7月初，越南劳动党锦普矿区委员会同工人一起组织了生产检查队，认真地发现和解决了生产中存在的问题，同时充分发动了广大职工投入“秋冬生产战役”，鼓励技术改革，严密保管机器。因此，克服了过去不能解决的困难，使生产进一步向前发展。
