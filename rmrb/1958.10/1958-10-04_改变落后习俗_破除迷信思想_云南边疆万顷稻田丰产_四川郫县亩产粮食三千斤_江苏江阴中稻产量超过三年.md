Xinhua News Agency, Kunming: Bumper harvest news keeps pouring in from the frontier minority areas of Yunnan Province. In the subtropical plains along the Lancang, Nujiang, and Honghe rivers, and in the valleys of the Gaoligong and Ailao Mountains, the ten thousand acres of rice paddies have been mostly harvested. In the Dehong Dai-Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture and the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, there are 87 townships and more than 250 agricultural cooperatives where the rice yield per mu exceeds 1,000 jin.

Since last winter, due to the expansion of multiple cropping areas, the grain yield per mu in the three autonomous prefectures of Honghe, Dehong, and Nujiang has reached the target of 800 jin. In 13 counties, including Ruili, Changning, and Jinping, the grain crop yield per mu has exceeded 1,000 jin or 2,000 jin. In the past, people in areas that used to eat as they harvested and were left with nothing after the harvest, have now obtained more than 1,000 jin of grain per person this year. In seven counties, including Jinghong, Mengla, and Mengzhe, and the four counties of the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture, the average grain amount per person has reached more than 2,500 jin.

Yunnan's frontier originally had a very backward production base, so the people of all ethnic groups are even more eager to change the backward situation. Since last winter, under the leadership of the Party, they have set off an unprecedented high tide of production with soaring enthusiasm. In more than half a year, the benefited area of water conservancy construction has reached more than 2 million mu, which is equivalent to half of the total water conservancy area in Yunnan Province before liberation. Ethnic groups in mountainous areas who could only grow buckwheat on dry land in the past have opened up terraced fields on the mountainside this year. All ethnic groups broke all customs and superstitions that hinder the development of production, and public toilets and livestock pens were built in the villages. This year, the amount of fertilizer applied per mu is more than 10,000 jin, completely changing the backward production habit of planting "plain water fields."

This newspaper reports: (Reporter Sun Yuedong reports) The fact that the grain output of Pixian County, Sichuan Province, has more than doubled this year refutes the fallacy that areas with better natural conditions and originally high output cannot achieve high-speed and large-scale increases in production. According to preliminary calculations, the total grain output of Pixian County this year reached more than 710 million jin, an increase of 1.8 times compared with last year; the average yield per mu jumped from more than 1,000 jin last year to about 3,000 jin.

Why did Pixian County achieve high-speed production increase this year? First of all, the Pixian County Committee of the Communist Party of China firmly grasped ideological education. The county launched a mass debate in conjunction with the rural rectification movement, criticizing the view that denied all advanced technologies, and summarized the typical experience of high-yield models that emerged last year as vivid teaching materials. On the basis of the masses' high morale and enhanced confidence, the county launched a vigorous agricultural basic construction campaign. The county transformed more than 80,000 mu of low-yield fields in two months, exceeding the total transformed area in the past eight years; combined with the sorting out of drainage and irrigation systems and cemeteries, the cultivated land area was expanded by more than 10,000 mu.

The experience of Pixian also shows that to achieve a great leap forward, it is necessary to break with conventions, boldly change old production technologies and old farming systems, rely on the masses to find solutions, and humbly learn from the advanced experiences of other regions.

The county also continuously carries out mass appraisal and inspection campaigns to promote the comprehensive and balanced development of various crop productions. Now, Pixian County has formulated a leap forward plan for 1959 at the four-level cadre meeting, deciding to plow to a depth of one and a half feet and apply 200,000 jin of fertilizer per mu. A greater leap forward is about to begin.

This newspaper reports: Jiangyin County, located between the Yangtze River and Taihu Lake, has an intermediate rice crop that accounts for nearly 90% of the annual grain output. The total output reached 2.2 billion jin, five times more than last year; the yield per unit increased 3.2 times compared to last year. This season's output is more than the total grain output of the three years from 1955 to 1957. Adding summer grain and a small amount of late rice, the average grain per person for the county's 920,000 people can reach 2,815 jin.

The high-yield satellite groups of intermediate rice are distributed in 35 people's communes throughout the county. The average yield per unit in five people's communes is more than 3,000 jin, and there are 100,000 mu of fields where some places have exceeded the 10,000 jin mark.

This year, the average income of farmers in the county will increase from 76 yuan last year to 100 to 120 yuan, all exceeding the living standards of local wealthy middle peasants. The accumulation of many people's communes is more than one million yuan, becoming "millionaires."

### 改变落后习俗　　破除迷信思想  云南边疆万顷稻田丰产  四川郫县亩产粮食三千斤　江苏江阴中稻产量超过三年

    改变落后习俗　　破除迷信思想
    云南边疆万顷稻田丰产
    四川郫县亩产粮食三千斤　江苏江阴中稻产量超过三年
    据新华社昆明电　云南省边疆少数民族地区到处传来丰收喜讯。在澜沧江、怒江、红河沿岸的亚热带平坝，和高黎贡山、哀牢山脉的峡谷之中，万顷稻田已大部收割完毕。德宏傣族景颇族自治州和西双版纳傣族自治州，水稻亩产千斤以上的就有八十七个乡和二百五十多个农业社。
    去冬以来，由于扩大了复种面积，今年红河、德宏、怒江等三个自治州粮食亩产量都已达到八百斤的指标；瑞丽、昌宁、金平等十三个县粮食作物亩产超过了千斤或双千斤。原来随收随吃收完吃完的地区，今年每人都获得了上千斤的粮食。景洪、勐腊、勐遮等七个县和怒江傈僳族自治州的四县，平均每人粮食达二千五百多斤。
    云南边疆原有生产基础十分落后，所以各族人民要求改变落后面貌的心情更为迫切。去冬以来，在党的领导下就以冲天的干劲掀起了规模空前的生产高潮。半年多的时间内兴修水利的受益面积达二百多万亩，相当于解放以前云南全省水利面积的一半。过去只能在旱地上种苦荞的山区民族，今年在山腰上开出了成片的梯田。各民族打破一切阻碍生产发展的习俗和迷信，在寨子里普遍修起了厕所和畜厩；今年每亩的施肥量都在万斤以上，完全改变了种“白水田”的落后生产习惯。
    本报讯　记者孙跃冬报道：四川省郫县今年粮食产量跃进一倍多的事实，驳倒了所谓自然条件较好、原来产量较高的地区不能高速度大面积增产的谬论。据初步计算，郫县今年粮食总产量达七亿一千多万斤，比去年增产一点八倍；平均亩产量由去年的一千多斤跃进到三千斤左右。
    郫县为什么今年能获得高速度增产？首先，中共郫县委员会紧紧抓住思想教育工作。全县结合农村整风展开大鸣大放大辩论，批判了否定一切先进技术的观点，并总结了去年出现的高额丰产典型经验作为活教材。在群众情绪高涨，信心增强的基础上，全县展开轰轰烈烈的农业基本建设运动。全县两月内改造低产田八万多亩，超过八年来改造面积的总和；结合整理排灌水系和坟园，共扩大耕地面积一万多亩。
    郫县的经验还说明：要大跃进就要打破陈规，大胆改变旧的生产技术和旧的耕作制度，依靠群众想办法和虚心学习其他地区的先进经验。
    全县还不断开展群众性评比检查运动，促进各种作物生产全面平衡发展。现在，郫县已在四级干部会上制订出1959年的跃进计划，决定深耕一尺五，每亩施肥二十万斤。一个更大的跃进又将开始。
    本报讯　位于长江和太湖之间的江阴县，今年中熟稻占全年粮食产量近90％，总产量达二十二亿斤，比去年增加五倍；单产比去年增加三点二倍。这一季产量比1955年到1957年三年中全年粮食总产量的总和还要多。加上夏粮和少数的晚稻，全县九十二万人口平均每人粮食可达二千八百一十五斤。
    中熟稻的高产卫星群分布在全县三十五个人民公社。平均单产在三千斤以上的有五个人民公社，五千斤以上的有十万亩田，有些地方突破了万斤关。
    今年，全县农民平均每人收入将从去年的七十六元提高到一百元至一百二十元，全部超过了当地富裕中农的生活水平。很多人民公社的积累都在百万元以上，成了“百万富翁”。
