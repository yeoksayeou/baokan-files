Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 12th - Accompanied by Qiao Xiaoguang, China's Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to North Korea, and Park Chun-seok, Deputy Director of the Protocol Department of the North Korean Cabinet's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Chinese People's Delegation headed by Guo Moruo arrived at the headquarters of the Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV) this morning by special train from Kaesong.

The CPV headquarters held a grand meeting tonight to welcome the kinsmen from the motherland. Wang Ping, Political Commissar of the CPV, delivered a welcoming speech at the meeting. He said that during the eight years of the Chinese People's Volunteers in Korea, they fought alongside the Korean people and the People's Army to defeat the American aggressors and jointly consolidate and develop the profound friendship with a long tradition between the Chinese and Korean people. All our victories and achievements have been achieved under the wise leadership of our great Party and Chairman Mao, and with the strong support and meticulous care of the people of the motherland. The victory of the CPV in resisting America and aiding Korea is a victory of the Party's political and military lines, a victory of the great unity of the people of the motherland, and a victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Glory should go to the Party and Chairman Mao, and should go to the great people of the motherland.

General Wang Ping said, we will soon be returning to our long-separated motherland. We note with grave concern that our motherland is being subjected to increasingly frantic aggression by US imperialism. We will never tolerate imperialism occupying our territory and trampling on our compatriots. We firmly support Premier Zhou's and Foreign Minister Chen's statements, and support Minister Peng Dehuai's "Letter to Compatriots in Taiwan." We must liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu. We would like to assure the people of the motherland that after we return to the motherland, we will refrain from arrogance and rashness and be ready at any time to respond to the call of the motherland, and accomplish any new task assigned to us by the motherland just as we carried out the task of resisting America and aiding Korea.

Head of the delegation Guo Moruo spoke amidst warm applause. He said, "Our delegation is here on the one hand to participate in the activities of the Korea-China Friendship Month, and on the other hand to welcome our most beloved people back home." At this moment, the entire audience unanimously shouted: "Wherever the motherland needs us, we will go!"

Next, Guo Moruo expounded on the great significance of the Chinese People's Volunteers holding high the banner of resisting America and aiding Korea, defending the country, and defeating US imperialism alongside the Korean people, and introduced the situation of the Great Leap Forward in the motherland. Guo Moruo's enthusiastic speech was constantly interrupted by thunderous applause. The entire venue was immersed in the boundless joy and excitement of kinsmen reuniting.

After the welcoming meeting, the CPV Political Department Cultural Troupe performed the five-act drama "Friendship" for the delegation.

Before the welcoming meeting began, the entire delegation, accompanied by CPV leaders and more than 300 headquarters officers, went to the CPV Martyrs' Cemetery to lay wreaths to the martyrs.

    志愿军随时准备响应祖国召唤
    志愿军总部盛会迎亲人表示卫国决心
    新华社平壤12日电　以郭沫若为首的中国人民代表团在我国驻朝鲜特命全权大使乔晓光、朝鲜内阁外务省仪礼部副部长朴千石等陪同下，今天上午由开城乘专车到达中国人民志愿军总部。
    志愿军总部今晚举行了盛大的欢迎祖国亲人的大会。志愿军政治委员王平上将在欢迎大会上致欢迎词。他说，中国人民志愿军在朝鲜的八年期间，同朝鲜人民和人民军一道共同打败了美国侵略者，共同巩固和发展了中朝两国人民的具有悠久传统的深厚友谊。我们的一切胜利和成就，都是在我们伟大的党和毛主席的英明领导下，在祖国人民的大力支援和无微不至的关怀下取得的。志愿军抗美援朝的胜利，是党的政治路线和军事路线的胜利，是祖国人民伟大团结的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利。光荣应该归于党和毛主席，应该归于伟大的祖国人民。
    王平上将说，我们不久就要回到久别的祖国去了。我们严重地注意到我们的祖国正遭到美帝国主义越来越疯狂的侵略。我们决不容忍帝国主义侵占我国领土、蹂躏我国同胞。我们坚决拥护周总理和陈外长的声明，拥护彭德怀部长的告台湾同胞书，一定要解放台、澎、金、马。我们愿向祖国人民保证，我们回到祖国以后，定要将不骄不躁地随时准备响应祖国的召唤，像执行抗美援朝任务一样地去完成祖国交给我们的任何新的任务。
    郭沫若团长在热烈的掌声中讲了话。他说，“我们代表团一方面是来参加朝中友好月活动，一方面是来欢迎我们最可爱的人回国的。”这时，全场一致高呼：“祖国需要我们到哪里，我们就到哪里去。”
    接着，郭沫若阐述了中国人民志愿军高举抗美援朝、保家卫国旗帜和朝鲜人民并肩打败美帝国主义的伟大意义，并且介绍了祖国大跃进的形势。郭沫若热情洋溢的讲话，不断为雷动的掌声所打断。整个会场沉浸在亲人相会的无限欢乐与激动之中。
    欢迎大会结束后，志愿军政治部文工团为代表团演出了五幕话剧“友谊”。
    欢迎大会开始前，代表团全体人员由志愿军首长和总部军官三百余人陪同，到志愿军烈士陵园向烈士们敬献了花圈。
