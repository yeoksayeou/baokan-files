Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, October 1st. The Chinese Ambassador to the German Democratic Republic held a reception on October 1st to celebrate the 9th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Grotewohl, and the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party, Ulbricht, spoke at the reception, supporting the just struggle of the Chinese people against U.S. military provocations. Grotewohl said that the military provocations of U.S. imperialism against China are a blatant violation of international law. China and the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union will never allow U.S. imperialism to wage war threats against the Chinese people. Its aggressive acts will inevitably end in complete failure.

Grotewohl also pointed out in his speech that the German Democratic Republic fully supports the Chinese government's acquisition of a legitimate seat in the United Nations as the sole representative of the Chinese people.

Ulbricht said that the aggressive actions of the U.S. imperialists against the Chinese people once again prove that wherever U.S. imperialism is active, there will be tension and new war dangers. The United States' interference in the internal affairs of the German people has also made the European situation more tense. The U.S. government has rudely rejected the proposal of the German Democratic Republic government to prepare a peace treaty with the participation of the two German governments. This means refusing to establish a peaceful, democratic, and unified Germany.

Ulbricht said that the People's Republic of China is now a powerful force in defending peace. The Chinese people have made great contributions in the competition of different systems and in the struggle to demonstrate the superiority of socialism. They and other socialist countries are closely united and will surely drive away the U.S. aggressors.

Ambassador Wang Guoquan spoke at the reception, saying, "If U.S. imperialism dares to provoke a war of aggression against China, it will inevitably be bruised and battered before the Chinese people and suffer a shameful defeat."

More than 500 people were invited to attend the reception, including Ulbricht, Dieckmann, Bolz and other party and government leaders of the German Democratic Republic, people from all walks of life, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to the German Democratic Republic.

The heads of sports delegations of various countries participating in the First International Summer Military Games were also invited to attend the reception.

    乌布利希和格罗提渥在我驻德大使招待会上说
    兄弟国家不许美国威胁中国
    新华社柏林1日电　中国驻德意志民主共和国大使在1日举行招待会，庆祝中国国庆九周年。德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥、德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希分别在会上讲话，支持中国人民反对美国军事挑衅的正义斗争。格罗提渥说，美帝国主义对中国的军事挑衅是对国际公法的一种粗暴破坏。中国和以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国绝不允许美帝国主义对中国人民进行战争威胁。它的侵略行为必将以彻底的失败而告终。
    格罗提渥在讲话中还指出，民主德国全力支持中国政府作为中国人民的唯一代表取得在联合国中的合法席位。
    乌布利希说，美帝国主义者对中国人民的侵略行动再一次证明，哪里有美帝国主义在活动，哪里就会造成紧张局势和发生新战争危险，美国干涉德国人民的内政，也使欧洲局势更加紧张化。美国政府粗暴地拒绝了德意志民主共和国政府关于在两个德国政府参加下准备对德和约的建议。这就意味着拒绝建立和平的、民主的和统一的德国。
    乌布利希说，中华人民共和国今天已经是保卫和平的强大的力量。中国人民在不同制度的竞赛中和显示社会主义的优越性的斗争中作出了伟大的贡献。他们和其他社会主义国家紧密地团结在一起，一定会赶走美国侵略者。
    王国权大使在招待会上讲了话，他说“如果美帝国主义胆敢挑起对中国的侵略战争，它就必将在中国人民的面前碰得头破血流，并且遭到可耻的失败。”
    应邀出席招待会的有乌布利希、狄克曼、博尔茨等民主德国党政领导人、各界人士和各国驻民主德国外交使节等五百多人。
    参加第一届国际友军夏季运动大会的各国军队体育代表团团长也应邀出席了招待会。
