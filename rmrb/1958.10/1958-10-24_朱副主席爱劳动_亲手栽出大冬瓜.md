Xinhua News Agency, October 22nd: Comrade Zhu De, Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China, who loves labor, has grown a batch of giant winter melons together with several staff members of the Central South Sea Administration. Five large winter melons personally cultivated by Vice Chairman Zhu are on display at the Exhibition of New Achievements in Science and Technology starting today.

Vice Chairman Zhu often does some physical labor in his spare time, such as planting grapes and flowers. During the cultivation of the winter melons, Vice Chairman Zhu often took advantage of his rest time to go to the garden to water, fertilize, and weed.

The four winter melon plants grown by Vice Chairman Zhu himself produced a total of eighteen melons, one of which produced six large winter melons, which is a rare phenomenon. The five large winter melons on display at the exhibition weigh a total of 225.5 jin; the largest one weighs 67 jin, is two and a half chi long, and has a diameter of one chi at its thickest point.
