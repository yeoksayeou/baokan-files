Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th -- TASS reported: Today, a press conference held in Moscow for Soviet and foreign journalists displayed an American balloon with instruments that was intercepted over Soviet territory. The press conference was hosted by the Soviet Foreign Ministry's Press Department.

The Acting Director of the Soviet Foreign Ministry's Press Department, Popov, made a statement at the press conference. In his statement, he pointed out that recently, several balloons with instruments, including some automatic control instruments, had been intercepted in Soviet airspace. Popov said that the markings on the instruments proved that they were manufactured in the United States and released by the United States Air Force, with the aim of photographing various targets in the Soviet Union from the air.

Popov said that the Soviet government has repeatedly pointed out to the U.S. government that it is unacceptable to grossly violate Soviet airspace. Popov went on to say that the flight of these balloons is dangerous to aircraft and residents.

The films and photographs displayed at the press conference clearly proved that the American military authorities are vigorously carrying out work using balloons to measure and target the launching of rocket weapons towards the Soviet Union.

The host of the press conference told reporters that the Soviet Union is also capable of launching similar balloons. However, the Soviet Union respects the sovereignty of other countries and therefore does not allow its balloons to fly over the territory of other countries. (Attached picture)

    苏联截获带仪器美国气球
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：今天在莫斯科举行的苏联和外国记者招待会上展出了一个在苏联领土上截获的美国气球。这次记者招待会是苏联外交部新闻司主持的。
    苏联外交部新闻司代理司长波波夫在记者招待会上发表了声明。他在声明中指出，最近在苏联领空截获了若干个带有仪器的气球，仪器中包括一些自动操纵仪器。波波夫说，仪器上的标志证明，它们是美国制造的，并且是由美国空军放出的，其目的是在空中拍摄苏联的各种目标。
    波波夫说，苏联政府不止一次地向美国政府指出，粗暴地侵犯苏联领空是不能容许的。波波夫接着说，这些气球的飞行对飞机和居民是危险的。
    在记者招待会上展出的胶片和照片明显地证明，美国军事机关正在大力进行工作，用气球来测定向苏联发射火箭武器的目标。
    记者招待会主持人向记者说，苏联也能够发射同样的气球。但是，苏联尊重其他国家主权，因而不让自己的气球在别国领土上空飞行。（附图片）
