Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The International Democratic Women's Federation recently wrote to Chinese women, representing billions of women around the world, angrily condemning the US imperialist acts of aggression against China and voicing support for the Chinese people's just struggle to liberate Taiwan and oppose US imperialist aggression.

The letter stated, "We angrily condemn the provocative aggression of the US armed forces against Chinese territory. This act of aggression is a wanton interference in China's internal affairs, and it flagrantly violates all principles of peaceful relations between countries." The letter continued, "Taiwan and the coastal islands were and are an integral part of China. We support your struggle to liberate Taiwan."

The letter also stated, "We express serious concern about the deployment of nuclear weapons and the unprecedented large-scale concentration of US armed forces within range of possible attack on the Chinese mainland." The letter stated that only by withdrawing these armed forces can the horrors of a new world war be avoided and the tension in the Taiwan region be eased.

The letter concluded by assuring Chinese women: "The International Democratic Women's Federation, representing billions of women, will do its utmost to publicize the nature of US imperialism's brutal aggression against China to the world. The growing protests of all peace-loving people will repel this brutal aggression and the new threat it poses to the Chinese people and to mothers and children around the world."

    世界亿万妇女谴责美国侵略
    国际妇联声援我国正义斗争
    新华社19日讯　国际民主妇联最近写信给中国妇女，代表全世界亿万妇女愤怒地谴责美帝国主义对中国的侵略行动，声援中国人民为解放台湾和反对美帝国主义侵略而进行的正义斗争。
    来信说，我们愤怒地谴责美国武装部队对中国领土的挑衅性侵略。这种侵略行动是对中国内政的无端干涉，它公然违反各国之间和平关系的一切原则。信中接着说，台湾和沿海岛屿过去和现在都是中国的组成部分，我们支持你们解放台湾的斗争。
    来信还说，我们对于在随时可以攻击中国大陆的范围之内设置核武器和空前大规模地集中美国武装部队表示严重不安。来信说，只有撤退这些武装部队，新的世界大战的恐怖才能避免，台湾地区的紧张局势才能缓和。
    来信最后向中国妇女保证：代表着亿万妇女的国际民主妇女联合会，将尽力向世界各地宣传美帝国主义对中国粗暴的侵犯本质。一切爱好和平人民的日益高涨的抗议将击退这种粗暴的侵犯给中国人民和全世界的母亲和孩子们带来的新威胁。
