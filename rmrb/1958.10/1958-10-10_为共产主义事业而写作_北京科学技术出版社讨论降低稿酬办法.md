Writing for the Cause of Communism
Beijing Science and Technology Publishing House Discusses Methods for Lowering Manuscript Fees

(Our report) Beijing's science and technology publishers unanimously support the proposal by Shanghai and Beijing newspapers and publishers to lower manuscript fees, and have decided to uniformly implement a method of generally reducing manuscript fee standards by about half, starting from October 1st. This was decided at a joint meeting held by Beijing's science and technology publishers on October 6th at the Chemical Industry Publishing House.

The meeting held that: An excessively high manuscript fee system causes the living standards of translators and compilers to far exceed the living standards of the general working people. This not only makes the lives of these people special and separates them from the worker-peasant masses, but it is also extremely incompatible with the communist spirit of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and office cadres who are now working day and night to strive to do more work without any extra compensation. The translators and compilers of scientific and technological books almost all have fixed jobs and relatively high salaries. Lowering manuscript fees will not affect their lives at all.

Attendees unanimously believed that: After the rectification movement, the anti-rightist struggle, and putting politics in command, the political consciousness of many authors and translators has greatly improved. Their purpose in writing is to build socialism and communism as soon as possible, not for manuscript fees. In the past and now, many authors and translators have proposed lowering manuscript fees, or even refusing to accept them, which is proof of this. Some people believe that lowering manuscript fees may affect the writing enthusiasm of authors and translators. This kind of doubt is completely inconsistent with the current actual situation.

    为共产主义事业而写作
    北京科学技术出版社讨论降低稿酬办法
    本报讯　北京各科学技术出版社一致拥护上海、北京报刊和出版社关于降低稿酬的倡议，并决定从10月1日起一致实行一般地降低稿酬标准一半左右的办法。这是北京各科技出版社10月6日在化学工业出版社举行的联席会议上决定的。
    会议认为：过高的稿费制度，使编译者的生活水平远远超过一般劳动人民生活水平，不仅使这些人的生活特殊化，脱离工农群众，而且与现在广大工农群众和机关干部夜以继日的力争多做工作不要任何额外报酬的共产主义精神也是极不相适应的。科学技术书籍的编译者几乎都有固定的职业和较高的工资待遇，降低稿费之后，也完全不会影响他们的生活。
    到会者一致认为：经过整风运动、反右斗争和政治挂帅以后，现在很多著译者的政治觉悟有了很大的提高。他们的写作目的，是为了早日建成社会主义和共产主义，并不是为了稿费。过去和现在都有许多著译者提议降低稿费，甚至拒收稿费，就是证明。有些人认为稿费降低以后可能影响著译者的写作积极性，这种怀疑是完全不合乎现在实际情况的。
