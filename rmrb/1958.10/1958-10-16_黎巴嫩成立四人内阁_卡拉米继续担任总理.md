Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, October 15th: The four-man Lebanese cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Karami, was announced late on the 14th.

Lebanese President Chehab accepted the resignation of Karami's eight-man cabinet and approved the list of the four-man cabinet. The new cabinet sees Karami concurrently holding the posts of Minister of Defense, Finance, Economy, and Information; Hussein Oweini (one of the leaders of the National Front) as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Justice, and Planning; Raymond Edde (leader of the National Bloc) as Minister of Interior, Social Affairs, and Post and Telecommunications; and Gemayel (Chairman of the Phalange Party) as Deputy Prime Minister concurrently responsible for the portfolios of Public Works, Health, Education, and Agriculture.

Karami and Oweini represent the opposition before Chamoun's downfall, and both are Muslims. Raymond Edde, after the outbreak of the Lebanese people's uprising, once mediated between the Chamoun group and the former opposition. The Phalange Party has always been a supporter of Chamoun. Edde and Gemayel are both Christians.

After the formation of the new cabinet, Karami told reporters that his new cabinet would pursue the "policy of neutrality and friendship with all Arab countries" as announced when his previous cabinet was formed. He said he hoped this cabinet would quickly stabilize the domestic situation.

    黎巴嫩成立四人内阁
    卡拉米继续担任总理
    据新华社大马士革15日电　由卡拉米担任总理的黎巴嫩四人内阁在14日深夜宣布成立。
    黎巴嫩总统谢哈布接受了卡拉米八人内阁的辞职，同时批准了四人内阁的名单。新内阁由卡拉米兼国防、财政、经济和宣传部长；侯赛因·乌埃尼（民族阵线领导人之一）任外交、司法和计划部长；雷蒙德·埃迪（民族集团领导人）任内政、社会事务和邮电部长；杰马耶勒（长枪党主席）任副总理兼公共工程、卫生、教育和农业部长。
    卡拉米和乌埃尼代表夏蒙下台以前的反对派，他们都是穆斯林。雷蒙德·埃迪在黎巴嫩人民起义爆发后，曾经一度在夏蒙集团和前反对派之间进行调停。长枪党则一直是夏蒙的支持者。埃迪和杰马耶勒都是基督教徒。
    卡拉米在新内阁成立以后对新闻记者说，他的新内阁将奉行他的前内阁成立时所宣布的“中立和同所有阿拉伯国家友好的政策”。他说，他希望这个内阁将很快地安定国内局势。
