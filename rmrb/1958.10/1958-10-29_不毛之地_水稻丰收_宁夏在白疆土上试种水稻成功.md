Rice Harvest in "Barren Land"
Ningxia Successfully Trials Rice Planting on White Alkaline Soil

(Reported by our newspaper) The Soil Improvement Experiment Station, composed of the Soil Improvement Institute of the Beijing Academy of Water Conservancy Science, the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Water and Electricity Bureau, and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Agricultural Science Research Institute, achieved a bumper harvest in its first attempt to grow rice on white alkaline soil, which has always been considered "barren land." In the 0.737 mu white alkaline soil improvement experimental field, the highest yield was in the green manure trial area, where 54 square meters of rice paddy yielded a total of 36.1 jin of rice, equivalent to a per-mu yield of 445.6 jin. This marks the end of the history of white alkaline soil being unusable and provides valuable data for soil science research worldwide.

White alkaline soil is a type of alkalized soil with strong alkalinity, a hard texture, and extremely poor water permeability and ventilation. When dry, it is as hard as iron, and when wet, it turns into a muddy mess. Therefore, it is known as "barren land."

This spring, in the wave of the Great Leap Forward across the country, all personnel at the Soil Improvement Experiment Station broke with superstition and proposed a plan to improve white alkaline soil and grow rice on it. This plan received strong support from the Party. They manually dug the selected malignant white alkaline soil to a depth of three to four inches, applied 4,000 jin of stable manure, 1,000 jin of green manure, 800 jin of gypsum, and 50 jin of bone meal per mu, and then sowed 40 jin of rice seeds on June 9. From June 24, when the rice seedlings grew three leaves, until August 21, when the ears emerged and were filling, they top-dressed with 10 jin of blood meal, 1,000 jin of pig manure, 10 jin of ammonium sulfate, and 25 jin (twice) of superphosphate, based on changes in soil quality and rice seedling growth; they sprayed 300 jin of liquid fertilizer, and then applied 10 jin each of superphosphate and ammonium sulfate along with the water flow. They changed the water every day or every two days and silted two to three inches of muddy soil during the rice growth period. In this way, the deep digging destroyed the original poor structure of the cohesive soil, ensuring the activity of the rice root system; washing with water greatly reduced the "sodium ions," which are the most harmful to crops in white alkaline soil; because most of the applied fertilizers were acidic, they could neutralize the residual alkalinity and weaken the degree of alkaline harm in the soil. At the same time, in order to prevent alkalinity from rising, they also changed the practice of draining and sun-drying the fields seven days after rice planting to prevent floating seedlings, and adopted the method of releasing shallow water, which both avoided floating seedlings and prevented the rise of alkaline air.

### “不毛之地”水稻丰收  宁夏在白疆土上试种水稻成功

    “不毛之地”水稻丰收
    宁夏在白疆土上试种水稻成功
    本报讯　由北京水利科学院土壤改良研究所、宁夏回族自治区水电局、宁夏回族自治区农业科学研究所等单位组成的土壤改良试验站，在一向被人认为是“不毛之地”的白礓土上第一次种植水稻获得丰收。七分三厘七毫白礓土改良试验田中，最高的压青试验区五十四平方公尺稻田，共收稻子三十六点一斤，折合亩产四百四十五点六斤。从此，结束了白礓土不能开发利用的历史，给世界土壤科学研究工作提供了宝贵资料。
    白礓土是一种含有强烈碱性的碱化土，质地坚硬，透水通气极差：干时坚硬如铁，遇水则泥泞一团。因此，被人称办“不毛之地”。
    今年春天，在全国大跃进的浪潮中，土壤改良试验站的全体人员，破除了迷信，提出改良白礓土，在白礓土上种植水稻的计划。这个计划得到了党的大力支持。他们用人工把选出的恶性白礓土深挖了三、四寸，每亩施了四千斤厩肥、一千斤绿肥、八百斤石膏和五十斤骨粉，然后在6月9日播下了四十斤稻种。从6月24日稻苗长出三个叶子时开始，到8月21日抽穗灌浆为止，根据土质改变情况和稻苗生长情况，分别追施了十斤血粉、一千斤猪粪、十斤硫酸錏、二十五斤（二次）过磷酸钙；喷施了三百斤液肥，然后顺水流施了过磷酸钙和硫酸錏各十斤。每天或每两天换一次水，并且在水稻生长期间淤积了二、三寸浑泥。这样，经过深挖，破坏了原来粘固土的不良结构，保证了水稻根系的活动；经过水洗大大减少了白礓土中对作物危害最大的“钠离子”；因为所施肥料多是酸性，能够和残余的碱性中和，削弱了土壤中碱性危害程度。同时，为了防止碱性上升，还改变了群众在种稻七天后撤水晒田、防漂秧的作法，采取放浅水的办法，既避免了漂秧，又防止了碱气上升。
