A few introductory notes on missiles

Editor's note: Since Chiang Kai-shek's air force, under the direct instigation of the United States, used missile weapons to attack our mainland air force, readers from all over have written letters expressing great indignation and raising some questions about the missile situation. Here is a brief reply:

	(1) A missile is a modern weapon. Its main difference from a rocket is that a missile has a control and guidance device that can control and correct the direction of flight during the flight. Rocket weapons do not have a control and guidance device, so they cannot control and correct the direction of flight during the flight. Generally speaking, a missile has three main components: (1) Warhead. Divided into two categories: ordinary warheads and nuclear warheads. (2) Power section, consisting of a rocket engine or a conventional jet engine, used to propel the missile. (3) Guidance section, usually radio, radar, infrared (heat-sensing), or other guidance devices.
	(2) There are many types of missiles. For example, according to the flight trajectory and manufacturing method, they can be divided into three major categories: ballistic missiles and other continuous control missiles. According to the range, they can be divided into long-range missiles, medium-range missiles, and short-range missiles. The range of long-range missiles is 8,000 kilometers or more, also known as intercontinental missiles. The range of medium-range missiles is about 2,500 kilometers. Medium-range and long-range missiles are also known as strategic missiles. The range of short-range missiles is within 1,000 kilometers, also known as tactical missiles. Usually, missiles are classified into the following types according to the different targets and launch positions:
	1. Surface-to-surface missile - refers to a missile fired from the ground at a ground target.
	2. Surface-to-air missile - refers to a missile fired from the ground at aircraft and other aerial targets.
	3. Surface-to-ship missile - refers to a missile fired from the ground at ships and other water targets.
	4. Air-to-surface missile - refers to a missile fired from an aircraft at a ground or ship target.
	5. Air-to-air missile - refers to a missile fired from an aircraft at aircraft and other aerial targets.
	6. Ship-to-surface missile - refers to a missile fired from a ship at a ground target.
	7. Ship-to-air missile - refers to a missile fired from a ship at an aerial target.
	8. Ship-to-ship missile - refers to a missile fired from a ship at ships and other water targets.
	(3) The "Sidewinder" missile is a type of air-to-air missile made in the United States. It has a simple structure and is mainly divided into three parts. The first part is the infrared automatic guidance system, consisting of an infrared receiver, guidance system, and auxiliary motor. The second part is the warhead, which is loaded with high explosives and is not yet a nuclear warhead. The third part is the power unit, which is a solid-fuel rocket. The missile is 2.8 meters long, 0.127 meters (5 inches) in diameter, 70 kilograms in total weight, 9 to 11 kilometers in range, and approximately 3,200 kilometers per hour (2.5 times the speed of sound). Usually, each aircraft carries two missiles. The Sidewinder missile is a tracking missile that can receive the hot airflow emitted by a jet engine at a certain distance (usually about 3 kilometers) and track the jet engine. The effective destruction radius of a Sidewinder missile explosion is approximately 10.6 meters (35 feet). (Attached picture)

    关于导弹的几点介绍
    编者按：蒋介石空军在美国直接指使下使用导弹武器向我大陆空军进攻以后，各地读者纷纷来信，表示极大愤慨，并对导弹情况提出一些问题，现简单答复如下：
      （一）导弹是一种现代化武器。它与火箭的主要区别是导弹有控制导向装置，能够在飞行的过程中控制和校正飞行方向。火箭武器则没有控制导向装置，因此在飞行过程中不能控制和校正飞行方向。一般说来导弹有三个主要组成部分：（1）弹头部分。分为普通弹头和原子核弹头两类。（2）动力部分，由火箭发动机或普通喷气发动机构成，用于推进导弹。（3）制导部分，通常为无线电、雷达、红外线（热感应）、或其他制导装置。
    （二）导弹种类很多，例如按飞行轨迹和制造方式的不同，可分为弹道导弹式和其他连续控制式导弹三大类；按射程的不同又可分为远程导弹、中程导弹、近程导弹等。远程导弹的射程为八千公里以上，亦称洲际导弹。中程导弹的射程为二千五百公里左右。中程、远程导弹又称战略导弹。近程导弹的射程为一千公里以内，亦称战术导弹。通常，导弹多按射击对象及发射位置的不同，分为如下几种：
    1、地对地导弹——指由地面射击地面目标的导弹。
    2、地对空导弹——指由地面射击飞机和其他空中目标的导弹。
    3、地对舰导弹——指由地面射击舰艇和其他水上目标的导弹。
    4、空对地导弹——指由飞机射击地面或舰艇目标的导弹。
    5、空对空导弹——指由飞机射击飞机和其他空中目标的导弹。
    6、舰对地导弹——指由舰艇上射击地面目标的导弹。
    7、舰对空导弹——指由舰艇上射击空中目标的导弹。
    8、舰对舰导弹——指由舰艇上射击舰艇和其他水上目标的导弹。
    （三）“响尾蛇”导弹是美国的一种空对空导弹。构造简单，主要分为三部分，第一部分为红外线自动导向系统，由红外线接收器、制导系统及辅助电动机组成；第二部分为弹头，装有烈性炸药，还不是原子核弹头；第三部分是动力装置，为一固体燃料火箭。导弹全长二点八公尺，直径零点一二七公尺（五吋），全重七十公斤，射程九至十一公里，时速约三千二百公里（二点五倍音速）。通常每架飞机携弹二枚。响尾蛇导弹是一种追踪导弹，它在一定的距离（一般为三公里左右）能够接受到喷气机所排出来的热气流，而追踪喷气机。响尾蛇导弹爆炸时有效破坏半径约十点六公尺（三十五呎）。（附图片）
