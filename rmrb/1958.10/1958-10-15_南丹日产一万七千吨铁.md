Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 13th. Nandan County in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region released a large satellite on the 11th with a daily output of 17,754 tons of pig iron, which is 566 tons more than the total amount of iron produced during the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region's first Five-Year Plan. In addition, 41,428 tons of sintered iron were produced on this day.

Before launching the steel satellite, all factories, mines, people's communes, and government schools in the county held mass mobilization meetings and extensively carried out debates on how to complete the steel task and for whom to complete the steel task. At the same time, red flag competitions were held, focusing on comparing drive, comparing advanced experiences, and comparing task completion. After this series of political propaganda and mobilization, more than 90,000 iron and steel field army personnel throughout the county, from factories to rural areas, and from government offices to schools, went all out and plunged into the battle of steel production.

In this great battle of steel, all iron smelting plants strengthened production management. The county universally adopted the "five determinations" method of production: determining leaders, determining tasks, determining time, determining manpower, and determining safety, thereby greatly improving pig iron efficiency.

In order to ensure that the steel satellite went into orbit, the county adopted the method of obtaining materials locally and supplying them locally. In the five coal-producing areas, such as Yueli and Luanjiang, a large amount of white coal was used for iron smelting; in areas without coal, miscellaneous wood was used for smelting. In addition to increasing the output of existing blast furnaces, the people's communes also made extensive use of old lime kilns, old charcoal kilns, old brick and tile kilns, and old earthen stoves, which were improved and used for iron smelting, making iron smelting production achieve more furnaces, more fuel, more ore, stronger wind, and stronger fire, thus overfulfilling the steel production task.

    南丹日产一万七千吨铁
    据新华社南宁13日电广西僮族自治区南丹县11日放出日产生铁一万七千七百五十四吨的大卫星，这比广西僮族自治区第一个五年计划所产生铁总和还多五百六十六吨。另外，这一天还产烧结铁四万一千四百二十八吨。
    在大放钢铁卫星之前，全县各厂矿、人民公社、机关学校，都纷纷召开了群众性誓师大会，并且全面地开展了如何完成钢铁任务，为谁完成钢铁任务的大辩论。同时还进行了以比干劲、比先进、比完成任务为中心的红旗竞赛。经过这一系列的政治宣传鼓动，全县从工厂到农村，从机关到学校九万多钢铁野战军，全力以赴，投入了钢铁生产的战斗。
    在这场钢铁大战中，各炼铁厂都加强了生产管理。全县普遍采取了定领导、定任务、定时间、定力量、定安全的生产五定办法，因此大大地提高了生铁效率。
    为了保证钢铁卫星上天，这个县采取了就地取材、就地供应的办法。月里、峦降等五个产煤地区，大量采用了白煤炼铁；在无煤地区，就用杂木进行冶炼。各人民公社除了提高已建高炉的产量外，还大量地利用旧石灰窑、旧木炭窑、旧砖瓦窑、旧土灶，经过改进后用来炼铁，使炼铁生产作到了炉多、燃料多、矿石多、风大、火大，因而超额完成了钢铁生产任务。
