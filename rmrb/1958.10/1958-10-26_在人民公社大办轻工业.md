After the realization of people's communes in our country's rural areas, there is an urgent need for all labor to be put into production, first and foremost to thoroughly liberate women from household labor. The current situation is that women eat in public canteens, and children go to nurseries and kindergartens, freeing them from housework such as cooking and taking care of children. However, the part of household labor that should be undertaken by factory production has not been completely resolved. Some women are tilling the fields and making shoes by the side of the fields during breaks; the processing of rice and flour, some is done by machine, and some still relies on manual and animal power. The 500 million peasants in the country need to wear more than 2 billion pairs of cloth shoes and process 300 billion catties of grain every year, which is not a small matter. Lenin once said: "Only where the petty household economy is transformed on a wide scale into large-scale socialist economy will there be genuine emancipation of women, genuine communism."

This year, agriculture has achieved a great harvest, and a large amount of agricultural products need to be processed. The quantity is so large that it is far beyond the capacity of existing enterprises. If it is not handled in time, it will not only fail to improve the living standards of the broad masses of people, but also damage the peasants' enthusiasm for production. Where to process it? Processing in cities, the capacity of existing industrial equipment is insufficient, raw materials are transported into the cities, and finished products have to be transported back to the countryside, and round-trip transportation will increase transportation difficulties. Mobilizing people's communes to run factories, using their own raw materials, processing them themselves, and consuming them themselves is the most economical and effective way.

Due to the abundant harvest and increased income of farmers, they demand to purchase a large number of daily necessities. Now many things feel in short supply. After the implementation of militarized organization, combat-ready action, and collectivized life, the need for clocks and watches has greatly increased. After eating in public canteens, families no longer light fires at home. In order to have hot water readily available, each family needs to buy one or even two or three thermos bottles. After the implementation of the Three-izations (Organization militarization, combat readiness action, and collectivized life), it is more conducive to carrying out the cultural revolution. In Jiangsu and other places, every class in some people's communes subscribes to a copy of Red Flag and the theoretical publications of the provincial party committee, and the demand for paper and stationery has surged. Facing such a large demand, relying solely on the production of existing large and medium-sized cities cannot solve the problem.

The people's commune is the best organizational form for gradually transitioning to communism, and it is also the basic unit of future communist society. Communism aims to eliminate the commodity economy, and the purpose of production is for direct consumption. The production of people's communes is basically for direct consumption. At present, people's communes are still in the initial stage of establishment, and the industrial foundation is still very weak. In order to realize both agriculture and industry, people's communes must vigorously develop industry. In order to realize rural industrialization and rural urbanization, communes must vigorously develop industry. However, some comrades have not yet realized that people's communes must vigorously develop industry. They are still accustomed to selling all agricultural products to cities for processing, and then buying things back from the cities. Especially comrades in areas close to cities and with convenient transportation have not yet realized that this habit must be gradually changed. They have not yet realized that in order to transition to communism, it is necessary to gradually weaken and even eliminate the commodity economy, and they still want to preserve the commodity economy. There are also some comrades who believe that people's communes are mainly engaged in agricultural production. This idea is also incorrect. Engels said: "The most even distribution possible of large-scale industry over the whole country is a condition precedent for the abolition of the distinction between town and country." Our country's people's communes must simultaneously develop industry like urban industrial and mining areas in order to gradually eliminate the boundaries between cities and the countryside and eliminate the difference between industry and agriculture.

Therefore, no matter from an economic or political point of view, from the perspective of developing production to meet needs, or from the perspective of moving towards communism, people's communes must vigorously develop industry, especially light industry. This is an inevitable trend that no force can stop.

People's communes have many favorable conditions for vigorously developing light industry. First of all, the raw materials are in the people's communes, and more than 80% of the raw materials for light industrial products are in the countryside. Later, when there is enough grain, more land can be freed up to grow more cash crops, and the raw materials for light industry will be more abundant. Moreover, vigorously developing light industry in people's communes, the required raw materials are closely integrated with agricultural production, which promotes both the development of industry and the development of agriculture. Second, production is for consumption, and the largest consumption is also in the people's communes. Third, there are funds and materials for running industry. The public accumulation of the Luwei People's Commune in Gaotang, Shandong this year is preliminarily estimated at 18 million yuan, and at least 3 million yuan can be invested in industry. As for the bricks, tiles, wood, and stone used to build factories, each people's commune can solve them. Fourth, there is labor. A people's commune has tens of thousands of laborers, who can be planned in a unified way for industry and agriculture, adjusted on time, and a part of the labor force can be drawn out to run industry, especially light industry, which women and people with weaker physical strength can do.

The vigorous development of light industry in people's communes is directly related to the lives of the broad masses of people, and it directly supports agricultural production and improves the living standards of the masses. The people's communes in Gaotang County, Shandong, have established flour mills and sewing factories. Now, more than 65% of the masses in the county eat machine-made flour and wear clothes sewn by machines. The masses have seen that with the development of industry, life will be even better. This has set off a high tide of the broad masses actively running industry. The situation of the masses consciously investing, donating materials, giving up houses to run factories, and loving factories like homes has generally appeared in people's communes everywhere.

However, some people doubt that people's communes do not have the conditions to run factories, and they think that they do not have equipment or technology. They cannot see the strength and wisdom of the masses and mystify technology. But the masses do not see it that way, and they are not intimidated. If they do not have equipment, they will make it themselves. The workers' slogans are: "Arm ourselves," "Local experts, use clever methods, don't worry about realizing mechanization." The Gaotang County Machinery Factory only had two or three people who had seen a gantry planer, and they made an eight-foot gantry planer with only a few simple machine tools. If there are no technicians, they will train them themselves. Since the county and commune-run industry was established this year in Gaotang County, the number of workers has increased by more than 15,000 compared with last year, including more than 8,000 technicians. Many workers study seriously, and masters teach seriously. They all learned to blacksmith in 20 days. Yin Guiying, an 18-year-old female worker, learned 11 kinds of technologies in two months, including sewing, carpentry, foundry, operating machine tools, and making ball bearings. It is unfounded to doubt that people's communes do not have the conditions to run industry. Especially light industry, as long as the people's communes want to run it, they can all run it.

Some people doubt that the labor force is currently tight, so how can there be surplus labor to run light industry? It is a fact that our country is currently carrying out large-scale construction, and all construction fronts need labor. But precisely because labor is tight, it is even more necessary to implement mechanization in tools and operations, and it is even more necessary to vigorously develop industry. It is inappropriate to juxtapose the tight labor force with the vigorous development of light industry in people's communes.

People's communes should run light industry, and they can also run light industry, so how exactly should they do it? We believe that it is necessary to thoroughly implement the policy of running industry by the whole party and the whole people, putting politics in command, mobilizing the whole people, relying on our own efforts, and carrying out mass movements on a large scale. Our country's light industry and food industry have many excellent traditions among the people. For example, the advanced production method in the world for the oil and fat industry is the leaching method, which requires benzene or alcohol as a solvent, and the equipment is also more complicated. However, my country's long-standing small mill sesame oil has simple equipment and uses water to bring out the oil. The use of this method to make peanut oil, rapeseed oil, and sunflower seed oil has achieved initial success. This shows that as long as we are good at relying on the masses, discovering, summarizing, and promoting the creations of the masses, pooling our wisdom and efforts, we will definitely be able to run factories in people's communes more, faster, better, and more economically.

The direction of running industry in people's communes, the Qiliying People's Commune in Henan put forward: "Do whatever you have, do whatever you need, do as much as you need." From the recent period of practice, we have realized that this policy is correct. People's communes adopt the policy of "Do whatever you have, do whatever you need" to run industry, so that social products can be greatly enriched, we can give full play to the manpower, material resources, and financial resources of the people's communes, produce what we need ourselves more quickly, and gradually eliminate the commodity economy.

Some people worry that this will mess things up, which is actually a conservative idea. They worry that the vigorous development of industry in people's communes will conflict with the existing industry in cities. They have not seen that the many industrial raw materials provided by agriculture are not less, but cannot be processed; the needs of the countryside have greatly increased, and many industrial products are not more, but are in short supply. For several years, matches have been overstocked, but today there are also areas where there is a shortage. The current problem of light industry is that the production capacity is not enough. Rural industry will not squeeze out urban industry. This worry is unrealistic.

In terms of practice, according to the past experience of township and commune-run industries, it should be mainly small-scale, combined with medium and small-scale, mainly using indigenous methods, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and prioritizing indigenous methods before foreign methods. Oppose the tendency of being greedy for big and foreign things, reaching out to superiors for materials and equipment, and not overcoming difficulties through self-reliance. Local experiences have also proved that those who have committed this tendency generally cannot run factories. And those who have adopted the method of starting from small to large and combining indigenous and foreign methods can quickly put into production. Mainly small-scale, but small factories are not a miniature of large factories; mainly using indigenous methods, but indigenous methods are not necessarily backward. Running small factories using indigenous methods is to adapt to local conditions, get started quickly, achieve economic benefits quickly, and solve the contradiction that current production cannot keep up with demand. In people's communes, if conditions permit, not only can medium and small-sized factories be run, but even modern large factories can also be run. In the use of indigenous methods, attention must be paid to the combination of indigenous and foreign methods. It is necessary to summarize the experience and wisdom of the working people, and also to adopt foreign advanced experiences that are applicable to us. On the issue of adopting equipment, whatever is available should be used. Bamboo, wood, bricks, stone, ceramics, and steel can all be used as materials.

The current situation of light industry is: on the one hand, it must give way to marshals, and on the other hand, after the bumper harvest of agricultural products, light industry is required to process a large amount and supply a large number of daily necessities. Therefore, the situation forces light industry to develop greatly in people's communes in order to overcome this difficulty. Moreover, running industry in people's communes is the development direction of our light industry, which not only develops light industry, overcomes current difficulties, and meets the needs of society, but also consolidates and develops people's communes, which is conducive to accelerating our country's socialist construction and gradually transitioning to communism.

    在人民公社大办轻工业
    轻工业部副部长　宋乃德
    我国农村在实现人民公社以后，迫切要求一切劳动力都能投入到生产中去，首先是把妇女从家务劳动中彻底地解放出来。目前的情况是妇女在公共食堂用饭，小孩进了托儿所、幼儿园，摆脱了做饭、看孩子等家务劳动。但是应该由工厂生产来承担的那一部分家务劳动还没有完全解决，有的妇女一边在田里翻地，休息时又在田边作鞋；米面加工，一部分使用机器了，一部分还靠人力、畜力。全国五亿农民一年要穿二十多亿双布鞋，要吃三千亿斤粮食都需要加工，这不是一件小事。列宁曾说：“只有开始把琐碎家务普遍改造为社会主义大经济的地方，才有真正的妇女解放，才有真正的共产主义。”
    今年农业获得了很大的丰收，有大量的农产品需要加工，数量之大，已远非现有企业所能承担。如果不及时加以处理，不仅不能提高广大人民的生活水平，而且会损伤农民的生产积极性。在哪里加工呢？在城市加工，现有工业设备能力不足，原料运进城市，成品又要运回农村，往返运输更将增加运输的困难。发动人民公社办工厂，利用自己的原料，自己加工，自己消费，却是一条最经济最有成效的途径。
    由于农业丰收农民收入多了，要求添购大量的日用品。现在许多东西都感到供应不足。实行组织军事化，行动战斗化，生活集体化以后，钟表的需要大大增加了。吃公共食堂以后，家里不再生火了，为了用开水方便，一家人都要买一个甚至二、三个保温瓶。实行三化以后，更有利于搞文化革命，江苏等地有的人民公社每一个班就订一份红旗和省委办的理论刊物，纸张文具的需要激增，面对着这样大量的需要，光靠现有大中城市的生产是解决不了的。
    人民公社是逐步向共产主义过渡的最好的组织形式，也是将来共产主义社会的基层单位。共产主义要消灭商品经济，生产的目的是为了直接消费。人民公社的生产基本上为了直接消费。目前人民公社还是初步建立，工业基础还很薄弱。为了实现亦农亦工，人民公社必须大办工业。为了实现农村工业化、农村城市化，公社更必须大搞工业。但是，有一部分同志还没有认识到人民公社必须大办工业。他们还习惯于把农产品全部卖给城市加工，又从城市买回东西。尤其是靠近城市、交通便利地区的同志，还没有认识到这种习惯是要逐步改变的。他们还没有认识到要过渡到共产主义就必须逐步削弱以至消灭商品经济，而仍然想保存商品经济。也还有的同志以为人民公社是以农业生产为主。这种想法也是不正确的。恩格斯说：“大工业在全国尽可能更平衡的分配，是消灭城市与乡村的分裂的条件”。我国人民公社必须像城市工矿区一样同时兴办工业，才能逐渐消除城市和乡村的界线，消除工业和农业的差别。
    因此，无论从经济上、从政治上来分析，从当前发展生产满足需要，从向共产主义迈进来看，人民公社都必须大办工业，尤其是大办轻工业。这是任何力量也阻挡不了的必然趋势。
    人民公社大办轻工业有种种有利条件。首先是原料在人民公社，轻工业产品的原料80％以上是在农村。以后粮食够用了，更可以腾出更多的土地多种经济作物，轻工业的原料将更加充沛。而且在人民公社大办轻工业，所需要的原料与农业生产密切结合，既促进了工业的发展，又促进了农业的发展。第二、生产是为了消费，而最大的消费也是在人民公社。第三、有办工业的资金和物资。山东高唐鲁伟人民公社今年公共积累初步计算有一千八百万元，投资于工业的至少可达三百万元。至于修建工厂用的砖瓦、木、石，各个人民公社都能解决。第四、有劳动力。一个人民公社有成万的劳动力，工农业统一筹划，按时调剂，可以抽出一部分劳力办工业，尤其是轻工业，妇女和体力较弱的人都可以干。
    人民公社大办轻工业是与广大群众生活直接联系的，而且直接支持了农业生产，也提高了群众的生活水平。山东高唐县人民公社办了面粉厂、缝纫厂，现在全县已有65％以上的群众吃到了机器面，穿到了用机器缝的衣服，群众已经看到了发展工业，生活还会更好。这就掀起了广大群众积极办工业的高潮。各地人民公社普遍地出现群众自觉地投资、献料、让房子办工厂和爱厂如家的情况。
    但是，也有人怀疑人民公社没有条件办工厂，认为他们没有设备，也没有技术。他们看不到群众的力量和智慧，把技术神秘化了。可是群众并不这样看，他们并没有被吓住，没有设备，自己制造。工人们的口号是：“自己武装自己”，“土专家，使巧法，不愁实现机械化”。高唐县机械厂只有两三个人见过龙门刨床，只凭几个简易机床就作出一台八尺龙门刨床。没有技工，自己培养，高唐县今年县社办工业以来，工人比去年增加一万五千多名，其中技术工人增加了八千多人。许多工人认真学习，师傅认真教导，二十天就全部学会打铁。十八岁的青年女工尹桂英两个月学会了缝纫、木工、翻砂、操作机床、制滚珠等十一种技术。怀疑人民公社没有条件办工业是没有根据的。特别是轻工业，只要人民公社要办，全都可以办得起来。
    有人怀疑目前劳动力紧张，那有多余劳力去办轻工业？我国目前大规模的进行建设，各个建设战线都需要劳动力，这是事实。但正因为劳力紧张，就更要在工具和操作上实行机械化，更要大办工业。把劳动力紧张和在人民公社大办轻工业对立起来的看法是不妥当的。
    人民公社应该办轻工业，也能够办轻工业，那么，究竟怎么办呢？我们认为，必须贯彻执行全党全民办工业的方针，政治挂帅，全民动手，自力更生，大搞群众运动。我国轻工业、食品工业在民间有许多优秀的传统。例如油脂工业在世界上先进的生产方法是浸出法，要用苯或酒精作溶剂，设备也较复杂。而我国历史悠久的小磨香油，设备简单，用水就把油带出来了。现在采用这个方法制花生油、菜子油、葵花子油已获初步成功。这说明，只要我们善于依靠群众，发现和总结、推广群众的创造，群策群力，一定能在人民公社把工厂办得又多又快又好又省。
    人民公社办工业的方向，河南七里营人民公社提出的是：“有啥办啥，要啥办啥，要多少办多少”。从最近一段实践中，我们体会到这个方针是正确的。人民公社办工业采取“有啥办啥，要啥办啥”的方针，才能使社会产品极大地丰富起来，我们就可以充分发挥人民公社的人力、物力、财力，更快地自己生产满足自己的需要，逐渐消灭商品经济。
    有人耽心这样会不会搞乱了，这实际上是一种保守思想。他们担心人民公社大办工业，会与城市现有工业发生矛盾。他们没有看到农业上提供的许多工业原料不是少了，而是处理不了；农村的需要大大增加了，许多工业品不是多了，而是供应不足。几年来火柴一直有积压，今天也有的地区出现了不足的现象。当前轻工业的问题是生产能力不够，农村办工业并不会挤了城市工业，这个耽心是不现实的。
    在做法上，根据过去乡社办工业的经验，应当是以小型为主，中小结合，以土法为主，土洋结合，先土后洋。反对那种贪大贪洋，伸手向上要材料、要设备，而不自力更生克服困难的偏向。各地经验也已证明，凡是犯有这种偏向的，一般都办不起工厂来。而采取了由小到大、土洋结合的办法的都能很快的投入生产。以小型为主，但小厂并非大厂的缩影；以土法为主，但土法也不一定落后。办小厂用土法乃是为了因地制宜，迅速上马，迅速取得经济效益，解决当前生产赶不上需要的矛盾。在人民公社中，如有条件，不仅可以办中小型厂，甚至也可以办现代化的大厂。在采用土法中，必须注意土洋结合。要总结劳动人民的经验智慧，也要采用外国适用于我们的先进经验，在采用设备的问题上，有什么的就用什么，竹、木、砖、石、陶瓷、钢铁作材料都可以。
    轻工业在目前所处的情况是：一方面要给元帅停车让路，另一方面农产品大丰收以后，要求轻工业大量加工处理，大量供应日用品。因此，形势逼着轻工业必须在人民公社大发展，才能克服这个困难。而且人民公社办工业是我们轻工业的发展方向，这样既发展了轻工业，克服了当前的困难，满足了社会的需要，又巩固和发展了人民公社，有利于加速我国的社会主义建设和逐步向共产主义过渡。（附图片）
