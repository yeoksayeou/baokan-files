    The Order Sounds Like a Mountain Collapsing

    The bugle call rang out resoundingly, breaking the silence of the fields and echoing rhythmically in the air. Ye Lianchi, the platoon leader of the Tiger Battalion, jumped up as if awakened, waking the young men while rushing outside. Here and there, the horse lamps were lit brightly, and people from each company and platoon were gathering. As soon as the battalion commander blew the whistle, the girls and young men had packed up and stood in formation. With a command, the entire battalion, carrying hoes and shovels, headed straight for the fields in the dim starlight. Five minutes later, they had already arrayed themselves to attack the earth.

    They were originally at the Penghe Reservoir. Two days earlier, the Lushan County Committee transferred them to Malou to help with deep plowing and manure delivery. As soon as the order was conveyed, some people couldn't help but murmur: There's plowing everywhere, why not plow in our own village? Why come to Malou? Before the words could fade, several voices rang out simultaneously: Look at you, Lushan is a commune, there's no "yours" or "mine." If Malou increases production, you also get a share. Model Worker Su (Su Dianxuan, director of the Malou branch) went to Beijing, we also get the glory. Someone said: Nowadays, rural areas transfer people on a moment's notice. We steel youths can go anywhere, even through ice and snow. We should listen to the Party, go wherever we're transferred. At a word, we get up and go. Indeed, this team of five hundred young people came to Penghe last winter to break the ice and go into the water. Ice edges cut their thighs, and blood stained the Penghe River red. Not one of them retreated, and finally they built the first dam on the Penghe River. When the dam was closed in July this year, they didn't sleep for three days and nights, throwing sandbags into the rapids day and night. The arduous project and collective life tempered them. Seventeen-year-old Chen Guangrong had lived with her grandmother since she was a child and had never left her side. When she first came to the construction site, she didn't dare to speak and didn't dare to pull a cart. Now she can both pull a cart and tamp the earth, and can do all kinds of jobs, big and small. When she heard about going to Malou to plow the land, she had no worries at all. Young Communist Party member Zhao Fusheng was even more determined. He said: The Party has prepared me to go wherever it sends me. I am prepared to smelt steel and liberate Taiwan. Wherever the Party sends me, I will go!

    In today's countryside, there are more than just thousands upon thousands of young men and women like Zhao Fusheng and Chen Guangrong. They have no worries, dare to act, and obey the Party's needs and assignments at any time, just like public servants. After the establishment of the People's Commune, under the unified dispatch of the County Party Committee, Lushan County's 200,000 laborers launched large-scale operations at any time. The County Party Committee grasped industry with one hand and agriculture with the other. More than 100,000 laborers launched a concentrated attack on the autumn harvest, and 80,000 to 90,000 laborers launched satellites of steel and coal. Everywhere on the roads were male and female combatants carrying bedding rolls, rushing to the mines, to the iron smelters, to the steel furnaces, and to the autumn harvest battlefield under the leadership of their company commanders, platoon leaders, and squad leaders. They freed themselves from the small plots of land that had bound them for generations and truly became the masters of production. Obedience to command and strict discipline made them seem like a combat force that could fight wherever it was directed. The slackness, backwardness, and selfishness of the small-peasant economy that had been left behind for thousands of years had become exhibits in a historical museum.

    Steel Old Youth

    Hundreds of hoes raised high, hundreds of shovels dug down together, all that could be seen was the century-old soil tumbling rapidly, rolling up layers of waves under their feet. Hundreds of young men, working with excitement, simply took off their long clothes and trousers, wearing only vests and shorts printed with the red words "Steel Youth". Under the shining October sun, the uniform green vests and red shorts were particularly striking. Passers-by couldn't help but stop and admire the vigor with which these young men were working. Leading this group of young men was Wang Duosan, an old man with gray hair and sixty-four years. He was tall and ruddy, also wearing a "Steel Youth" vest. Watching him plow the land was truly an art. The shovel danced evenly in his hands, turning the soil a foot deep on the first stroke, another eight inches on the second stroke, and lightly leveling the soil on the third stroke. His movements were clean and neat, no more and no less, each stroke just right.

    Wang Duosan, the sixty-four-year-old "Steel Youth," came to the Penghe construction site last year with five hundred young people and was one of the first pioneers of Penghe. In the season when water dripped into ice, he and the young people broke the ice and went into the water; under the scorching sun of July, he pushed a cart of seven or eight hundred pounds of soil up the slope, pushing more than eighteen cubic meters of soil a day. What power made him so selfless? In the old society, he was a good farmer, but the more he worked, the more he was exploited by the landlords, and his labor was just a means of providing the landlords with food and drink. After liberation, his family was allocated land, and with a family of more than a dozen people, they sold surplus grain every year and didn't have to worry about food and clothing. But at that time, his labor was just a means of earning food and clothing. It wasn't until he went to the Penghe construction site that the purpose of his labor changed. He said: "The completion of the reservoir is a blessing for future generations. I am sixty-four years old this year, and I can only work for a few more days before I have to create happiness for future generations. I won't feel guilty even if I die." In this way, when his labor became a means of making many people happy, a passion for dedication emerged. Because of his outstanding labor and selfless labor, he was elected as a model more than ten times, and many people learned from his advanced experience, calling him Model Worker Wang, as if forgetting his name. A month ago, he joined the Party. Now, on the battlefield of deep plowing, he is leading a group of young people, working fiercely like tigers descending the mountain.

    Hard Work Exchanges for Happiness

    If some elderly and middle-aged people still have the shadow of private ownership in their minds, and they inevitably calculate how much work they do and how much they get paid, then in this team of steel youths, young people rarely work according to quotas. They always break through the quotas, work hard and desperately, and dig out all their potential. What they like to say is to complete the task by more than 100%, and what they like to hear is launching satellites and creating miracles. Lushan established a commune and implemented a food supply system, which was just right for them. From then on, they could wholeheartedly listen to the Party's command and eat wherever they went to work. It was really fresh and free. Here, they get up at four thirty every day and work until twelve o'clock late at night. Except for eating, they only rest for twenty minutes. Deep plowing the land one and a half to two feet deep and delivering tens of millions of pounds of manure, do they feel bitter about such tiring work? Ye Lianchi said it well: Only by working hard, desperately, and拼命干can happiness come; by working plainly, happiness will not come naturally. Hard work exchanges for happiness has become their belief. And tense labor, because of constantly overcoming difficulties, constantly challenging competitions, and promoting each other, becomes a sincere freedom and joy. Look, the Tiger Battalion is competing with the Tiezai Battalion, and the Malou Battalion is challenging the Yangcun Battalion; female general Zhao Shuqin has just issued a challenge to old hero Wang Duosan, and hero platoon leader Ye Lianchi has set up a challenge for the entire battalion...

    The night is deep, the northeast wind is blowing fiercely, and the soil has become hard and solid, making it more difficult to dig with the hoe. They don't relax at all. Under the bright light of the gas lamp, they turn the soil while singing: The east wind rises, whistling, plowing the satellite fields is like a battlefield. Tools are like guns and knives, clods are like American wolves. American wolves, won't last long, clods smashed to death, from now on difficult to be rampant... In this way, their plowing efficiency has increased from one or two cents of land a day to five or ten cents of land. In the constant overcoming of difficulties, hard work has become a kind of pleasure and happiness that is aware of one's own strength and full of confidence in the future. What's more, they are good at dreaming about tomorrow!

    The Earth Shakes and Iron Arms Wave

    Yes, tomorrow is gradually approaching them. In fact, on the field where they are working, seven tractors are deep plowing the land. Wei Shunde, who is operating car number one, was still leading a group of young people at home, hoeing the ground with hoes one by one, half a month ago. More than ten days ago, he was transferred to the tractor driver training class, took five or six days of classes, and after two days of practice, he has now steadily grasped the steering wheel and is plowing a new path, one and a half feet deep, straight across the vast wilderness. The tractor roared, its sharp iron teeth and the hundreds of strong hands gnawing at the ground together, the earth shaking under the powerful swing of these iron arms. In the whole of China, there should be tens of millions of hands deep plowing hundreds of millions of acres of land! The tightly bound chest of Mother Earth has been liberated, she has taken a deep breath, sweetly breathing in the full sunshine and air. Next year, she will nurture even more abundant fruits to repay these children who serve her day and night, sleeping only two or three hours a day. In Lushan, people are asking Mother Earth for next year's grain, at ten thousand catties per mu!

    地动铁臂摇
    ——三秋散记
    本报记者　金凤
    令出如山倒
    号声嘹亮地响起来了，它冲破了田野的寂静，有节奏地回旋在空中。虎营排的排长叶连池像给人摇醒了似地，一骨碌跳了起来，他一面叫醒小伙子们，一面忙着往外跑。这里那里一盏盏马灯，已点得明晃晃地，各连各排的人正在集合。营长一吹哨子，姑娘们、小伙子们都已收拾停当站好队。一声口令，全营人马扛着镢头、铁锨，迎着星月的微光，直往田间开去。五分钟后，他们已经摆开阵势在向地球进攻了。
    他们原在彭河水库上，两天以前，鲁山县委调他们来马楼帮助深翻土地和送粪。命令一传达，不免有人小声叽咕：到处是翻地，回咱村翻地不中，何必上马楼？话音未落，几个声音同时响起：看你说的，鲁山是一个公社，还分你的我的。马楼增产了，你也有份。苏劳模（马楼分社社长苏殿选）上了北京，咱也光荣。有人说：现时农村调人都是说走就走，咱钢铁青年冰里雪里都去得，更该听党的话，调到那里去那里，一声令下，站起就走。确实的，这一支五百青年的队伍，在去冬腊月就来到彭河破冰下水，冰凌割破了他们的大腿，鲜血染红了彭河的河水，他们没有一个人退缩，终于打起彭河头一道拦河坝。今年7月大坝合龙，他们三天三夜没睡，往急流里日夜投掷着沙土袋。艰苦的工程和集体的生活，锻炼了他们。十七岁的小妮陈光荣，从小跟奶奶一起过活，从未离过奶奶身边。咋一来到工地，她连话都不敢说，连架子车也不敢拉。如今她既能拉架子车又能打夯，大大小小的活都能干了。这次听说到马楼翻地，她一点顾虑也没有。青年共产党员赵福生更坚决，他说：党调我去哪儿我都作好了准备，炼钢铁、解放台湾都准备去，党调我到哪儿我都去！
    在今天的农村，像赵福生和陈光荣这样的男女青年，已不止成千上万。他们一无顾虑，敢作敢为，随时服从党的需要和调派，就和公家人一样。而在人民公社成立以后，鲁山全县二十万劳力在党委统一调派下，随时展开大兵团作战。县委一手抓工业，一手抓农业，十多万劳力突击三秋，八、九万劳力大放钢铁和煤炭卫星。大路上到处是背着铺盖卷的男女战斗员，在他们的营长、连长、排长带领下，急急忙忙赶往矿山，赶往炼铁厂，赶到炼钢炉旁，赶到三秋战场上去。他们摆脱了世世代代束缚着他们的小块土地，真正作了生产的主人。服从指挥，纪律严明，俨然是一支指到哪里打到哪里的战斗部队。千百年来遗留下来的小农经济的散漫落后和自私本位，已经成为历史展览馆里的陈列品了。
    钢铁老青年
    几百把锄头高高举起，几百把铁锨一起铲下，只看到百年陈土飞快翻滚，在他们脚下卷起层层浪花。几百个小伙子干得兴起，索性脱下长衣裤，只穿着印着“钢铁青年”红字的背心和裤衩。在10月阳光的照耀下，那一色的绿背心红裤衩分外夺目。走路的人经过，都忍不住停脚赞叹这帮小伙子干的撒泼。而在这群小伙子的前头领先的却是一个头发已经花白的六十四岁的老汉王多三。他身材高大，脸色红润，也穿着“钢铁青年”的背心。看他翻地真是一种艺术，铁锨在他手里均匀地舞弄着，头一下土翻下一尺深，再一下又下去八寸，第三下轻轻的将土拨拉匀正。他的动作干净利落，不多不少，每一下恰到好处。
    六十四岁的“钢铁青年”王多三，去年和五百年轻人一起到彭河工地，是彭河的第一批尖兵。在滴水成冰的季节里，他和青年们一起破冰下水；在7月骄阳灼灼的照射下，他推着七八百斤的土车往坡上飞跑，一天推土十八方多。什么力量使他这样奋不顾身呢？在旧社会，他种得一手好庄稼，但他劳动得愈多，就被地主榨取得愈多，他的劳动不过成为供地主大吃大喝的一种手段。解放以后，他家分了土地，一家十几口，年年卖余粮，吃穿不用愁了。但他那时的劳动，还只不过是谋取衣食的手段。只等到他上了彭河工地，他劳动的目的才变了。他说：“水库修成是下辈子孙的福哇，我今年六十四岁了，还能干几天就得给下辈儿孙们造下幸福，死也不愧心。”就这样，当他的劳动变成了使许多人幸福的一种手段时，献身的热情就出现了。由于他出色的劳动、忘我的劳动，他十几次的当选模范，许多人向他学习先进经验，喊他王劳模，仿佛忘了他的名字。一个月以前，他入了党。如今在深翻地的战场上，他带着一帮青年，就如猛虎下山一般猛干着。
    苦干换幸福
    如果说在有些老年壮年人的脑子里，还投下私有制的阴影，他们干活，还不免计较干多少活，拿多少报酬，那末在这一群钢铁青年的队伍里，年青人几乎很少按定额劳动。他们总是突破定额，拼命苦干、猛干，把自己所有的潜力都挖出来。他们爱说的是超额100％完成任务，爱听的是放卫星、立奇迹。鲁山成立一个公社，实行伙食供给制，可对他们的劲了。从此他们可以一心一意听党的指挥，走到哪儿劳动，就在哪儿吃饭。真是又新鲜，又自由。在这里他们每天都是四点半起床，一直干到深夜十二点。中间除了吃饭，只休息二十分钟。深翻土地一尺五到二尺，送粪几千万斤，这样累的活，他们觉得苦不苦呢？叶连池说得好：只有大干、苦干、拼命干幸福才会到来；平淡淡的干，幸福是不会自然到来的。苦干换幸福，成了他们的信念。而紧张的劳动，因为不断的克服困难，不断的挑战竞赛，相互促进，就变成一种真心的自由和欢乐。看，虎营排在和铁寨排竞赛，马楼营又在和杨村营挑战；女将赵淑琴刚向老英雄王多三下了战书，英雄排长叶连池又向全营摆下擂台……。
    夜深了，东北风吹得呼呼的响，土地变得又坚又硬，镢头掘下去更费劲了。他们一点不松劲，在明亮的汽灯照耀下，他们一面翻着土块，一面唱：东风起，呼呼响，卫星田里翻地当战场。工具好比枪和刀，坷垃好比美国狼。美国狼，不久长，坷垃打碎命丧亡，从今难以再猖狂……。就这样，他们翻地的工效，从一天一分、二分地，提高到五分十分地。在不断的克服困难中，艰苦的劳动，变成了一种意识到自己力量和对前途充满信心的愉快和幸福。何况他们还善于梦想明天呢！
    地动铁臂摇
    是的，明天正逐渐走近他们身旁。事实上，就在他们劳动着的一块田野上，七部拖拉机在深翻着地。操纵着一号车的魏顺德，半个月前还在家带领着一伙青年，用锄头一下下锄着地。十多天前，他调到拖拉机手训练班，上了五六天课，经过两天的实习，如今他已经稳稳掌握住驾驶盘，在广阔的原野上，笔直地犁出一道深一尺五寸的新路。拖拉机轰鸣着，它的锋利的铁齿和那几百双强壮的手一起啃着地面，大地在这些铁的胳臂的有力摇摆下震动了。在全中国该有几千万双手在深翻几亿亩的土地！大地母亲紧缚着的胸怀被解放了，她深深地透了口气，甜美地呼吸着充分的阳光和空气。明年，她将哺育出更丰富的果实，来报答这些每天只睡三两个小时、不分白天黑夜侍候着她的孩子们。在鲁山，人们向大地母亲索取明年的粮食，是每亩双万斤！
