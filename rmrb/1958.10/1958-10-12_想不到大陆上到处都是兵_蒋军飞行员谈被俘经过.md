Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 11th. "People's Air Force News" reporter Liu Changdong reported: On the afternoon of the 10th, this reporter met Zhang Naijun, a Chiang Kai-shek pilot who was shot down and captured by our heroic Air Force in a certain location on the Fujian front. He is a second lieutenant pilot of the 5th Brigade of the Chiang Kai-shek Air Force, twenty-three years old this year, and from Lianshui County, Jiangsu Province. When this reporter met him, he was fully equipped with American equipment. His flight suit was filthy and patched in places. The helmet-like flight cap had "USAF" written on it, and a piece of the black lens on the cap had been broken off during the parachute jump. The abrasions on his neck and hands from the parachute jump had already been covered with gauze. With his head drooping, he described to the reporter the circumstances of his capture: "When I was about to land after parachuting, I saw groups of people running towards me. As soon as I landed, countless men and women were pointing guns at me, telling me to surrender." At this point, he said with bewilderment, "I didn't expect soldiers to be everywhere on the mainland." When asked how he was shot down, he stared blankly at his toes and said weakly: "Before I had time to figure out the situation in the air, I suddenly felt the fuselage shake violently, and I immediately lost consciousness. When I woke up, the plane was out of control, so I had to parachute." As he said this, his nose was dripping with sweat. It seemed that the power of the People's Air Force's strong firepower and its unexpected tactical movements still made him feel lingering fear even now.

    “想不到大陆上到处都是兵”
    ——蒋军飞行员谈被俘经过
    新华社福建前线11日电　“人民空军报”记者刘昌东报道：10日下午，记者在福建前线某地见到了上午被我英勇空军击落被俘的蒋军飞行员张乃军。他是蒋空军第五大队少尉飞行员，今年二十三岁，江苏省涟水县人。记者见到他的时候，他全身上下都是美国装备，飞行服污秽不堪，有的地方还打了补钉。钢盔似的飞行帽写着“USAF”，帽子上的黑色镜片，已在跳伞时摔掉一块。脖子上和手上跳伞时的擦伤，已经敷上了纱布。他搭拉着脑袋向记者叙述了被俘时的情形：“在跳伞快着陆的时候我就看到了成群的人向我跑来，刚一着地，就有数不清的男女拿枪对着我，要我投降。”说到这里，他疑惑不解的说：“想不到大陆上到处都是兵。”当记者问到他是怎样被击落的时候，他两眼无神地瞅着自己的脚尖，有气无力地说：“在我还没有来得及弄清空中情况时，突然觉得机身猛的一抖，顿时失去了知觉，我醒过来的时候，飞机失去了操纵，我只好跳伞。”说到这里，他的鼻子尖上直冒热汗，看样子，人民空军强大炮火的威力和出敌不意的战术动作，直到现在使他还心有余悸。
