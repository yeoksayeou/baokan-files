Xinhua News Agency Comprehensive Report: The German Democratic Republic (GDR) has achieved brilliant successes in economic construction over the past nine years. Industry and agriculture have seen tremendous development. Its total industrial output value now ranks fifth in Europe.

The development speed of major industrial sectors is very rapid. From 1950 to 1957, the country's power generation increased from 19.4666 billion kWh to 32.7355 billion kWh, lignite from 137 million tons to 212.6 million tons, and pig iron from 337,200 tons to 1.66 million tons. During this period, the total industrial output value increased by approximately 1.3 times.

In the first nine months of this year, industrial output increased by more than 11% compared to the same period last year, almost doubling the original state plan.

During the first Five-Year Plan (1951-1955), several large industrial enterprises such as the Stalin Steel Plant Combine and the Lauchhammer Coking Plant emerged. A shipbuilding industry was established in the north. Many existing enterprises were expanded and renovated.

Currently, thousands of workers, engineers, and technicians in the chemical industry are striving to realize the task put forward by the Fifth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany—to ensure the high-speed development of the chemical industry. One of the world's largest sulfuric acid industrial enterprises, the sulfuric acid plant in the Halle district, will soon be completed.

Since the beginning of this year, the agricultural collectivization movement in the GDR has developed even faster. In the past few months, a total of more than 2,800 new agricultural production cooperatives have been established nationwide, which is more than four times the number of cooperatives newly established in the entire last year.

Currently, there are approximately 9,500 agricultural cooperatives nationwide. The cultivated land owned by the cooperatives already accounts for more than one-third of the country's total cultivated land area, while last year it only accounted for about one-quarter.

Agricultural cooperatives have demonstrated their superiority in production. This year, the average yield of grain per hectare in agricultural cooperatives is higher than that of individual farmers.

According to preliminary estimates, the country's total grain harvest this year will increase by approximately 700,000 tons compared to last year.

Xinhua News Agency: The Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic has decided to further reduce the prices of a batch of daily necessities and food items starting from October 6th this year (on the eve of the ninth anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic). This price reduction will increase residents' purchasing power by 360 million marks annually.

According to the decision, leather and artificial leather products will be reduced by 25%, footwear by 53%, and soaps by an average of 30%. The prices of eggs and lard will also be reduced.

This price reduction is another measure taken by the GDR to improve people's living standards, following the complete abolition of the rationing system on May 29th and the reduction of prices on July 7th this year.

The decision pointed out that these achievements are primarily the result of the efforts made by the working people in completing the national economic plan and realizing the goals set by the Fifth Congress of the Socialist Unity Party.

    民主德国社会主义建设快马加鞭
    今年头三季工业产量比原定计划增加一倍
    本报综合报道　民主德国九年来在经济建设方面获得了辉煌的成就。九年来工农业获得巨大发展。现在它的工业总产值已经占欧洲第五位。
    各主要工业部门的发展速度是很快的。从1950年到1957年，全国的发电量由一百九十四亿六千六百万度增加到三百二十七亿三千五百万度，褐煤由一亿三千七百万吨增加到二亿一千二百六十万吨，生铁由三十三万七千二百吨增加到一百六十六万吨，在这段时期中，工业总产值约增加了一点三倍。
    今年头九个月工业产量比去年同期增长11％以上，比国家原定计划几乎增加了一倍。
    在第一个五年计划（1951—1955年）期间，国内出现了像斯大林斯塔特冶金联合工厂、劳赫哈姆焦煤工厂等若干大型工业企业。在北部建立起了造船工业。许多原有的企业都扩建和改建了。
    现在化学工业中成千上万的工人、工程师和技术员正在努力实现德国统一社会党第五次代表大会所提出的任务——保证化学工业高速度的发展。世界上最大的硫酸工业企业之一——哈雷专区的硫酸工厂很快就要建成。
    今年以来，民主德国的农业合作化运动有了更快的发展。在过去几个月中，全国总共新建了两千八百多个农业生产合作社，这个数目比去年全年新建的合作社数目多四倍多。
    目前全国约有九千五百个农业合作社。合作社拥有的耕地面积已经占全国耕地面积的三分之一以上，而去年只约占四分之一。
    农业合作社在生产中显示了优越性。今年农业合作社每公顷谷物的平均收获量比个体农民多。
    据初步估计，今年全国谷物的收获量大约比去年增加七十万吨。
    新华社讯　德意志民主共和国部长会议决定从今年10月6日（德意志民主共和国国庆九周年前夕）开始，再次降低一批日用品和食品的价格。这次减价将使居民的购买力每年提高三亿六千万马克。
    根据决定，皮制品和人造皮制品将减价25％，鞋类将减价53％，肥皂类平均减价30％。鸡蛋和猪油也将分别减低价格。
    这次减价是民主德国继今年5月29日全部取消配给制和7月7日降低物价以后，为提高人民生活所采取的又一项措施。
    决定指出，这些成就首先是劳动人民在完成国民经济计划和实现统一社会党第五次代表大会所制定的奋斗目标方面所作的努力的结果。
