Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, October 13th: The Secretary-General of the Mongolian Trade Union Central Council, Gambasuren, told reporters from this agency today that the Mongolian working class fully agrees with and supports the "Message to Compatriots in Taiwan" issued by Chinese Minister of National Defense Peng Dehuai, and the Ministry of National Defense's order issued on the 13th regarding another two-week suspension of shelling of Jinmen. He said that liberating Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu, whether by war or peace, are all internal affairs of the Chinese people and no foreign interference is allowed.

Gambasuren condemned the United States' attempt to confuse China's suspension of shelling Jinmen with their so-called "ceasefire" and to create a "two Chinas" plot. He emphasized that there is only one China in the world, and the creation of "two Chinas" must never be allowed. Despite the various tricks played by American imperialism, their conspiracy will never succeed. The Chinese people's determination to liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands cannot be stopped by any conspiracies or tricks. Gambasuren also emphasized that the tense situation in the Taiwan Strait area was created by the United States, and the United States should be held responsible.

Gambasuren also said that the Mongolian Trade Union Central Council and the Mongolian Peace Committee have decided to hold a Peace Movement Week throughout the country starting on the 16th of this month to publicize the current international situation, support the Chinese people's just struggle to liberate Taiwan, support the national liberation movements of the Asian and African peoples, and demand a ban on the manufacture and use of nuclear weapons.

    蒙古工会中央理事会秘书长说：
    决不允许制造“两个中国”阴谋
    新华社乌兰巴托13日电　蒙古工会中央理事会秘书长冈布苏伦今天对本社记者说，蒙古工人阶级完全赞同和支持中国国防部长彭德怀发表的告台湾同胞书和国防部13日发表的关于对金门炮击再停两个星期的命令。他说，解放台、澎、金、马，要战要和，这些都是中国人民的内政问题，不容许外人进行干涉。
    冈布苏伦谴责美国企图把中国暂停炮轰金门的措施和他们所说的“停火”混淆起来并且制造“两个中国”的阴谋。他强调说，世界上只有一个中国，决不允许制造“两个中国”。尽管美帝国主义玩弄各种花招，他们的阴谋是绝不会实现的。中国人民解放台湾和沿海岛屿的决心是任何阴谋诡计也阻挡不住的。冈布苏伦还强调指出，台湾海峡地区的紧张局势是美国制造的，应由美国负责。
    冈布苏伦还说，蒙古工会中央理事会和蒙古保卫和平委员会决定从本月16日起在全国举行和平运动周，来宣传当前的国际形势，支持中国人民解放台湾的正义斗争，支持亚非人民的民族解放运动，要求禁止制造和使用核武器。
