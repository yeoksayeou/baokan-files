    Harvest

    The autumn sky is clear and the air is fragrant for miles,
    Thousands of acres of rice paddies are more golden than gold,
    A gentle breeze stirs up a thousand layers of waves,
    Male and female commune members are busy harvesting.

    The rice grains are full and hang long,
    Brought home and piled up into walls,
    Rice walls piled so high they disappear from view,
    The fragrance can be smelled from ten miles away.
      (Sichuan, Gulin)

    丰收
    秋高气爽万里香，
    千顷稻田赛金黄，
    清风吹起千层浪，
    男女社员收割忙。
    稻粒饱满吊吊长，
    收回家去堆成墙，
    稻墙堆得不见顶，
    十里以外闻着香。
      （四川　古蔺）
