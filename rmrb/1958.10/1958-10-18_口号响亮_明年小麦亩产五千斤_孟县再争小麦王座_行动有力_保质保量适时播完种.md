According to a report from the Henan Daily: Meng County, a well-known high-yield wheat area in the country (Editor's note: Meng County is one of the two counties with the highest winter wheat yield in the country this year, with an average yield of over 600 jin per mu), is striving to achieve 5,000 jin per mu next year, setting off a mass upsurge of timely sowing and ensuring quality. The county's 350,000 mu wheat sowing task for this year was basically completed by the 15th of this month.

In order to achieve 5,000 jin per mu in Meng County next year, the county has made full preparations for wheat planting in terms of water, fertilizer, soil, and seeds. At the beginning of wheat planting, out of the county's 75,000 laborers, 40,000 strong laborers participated in the large-scale steel production, resulting in insufficient wheat planting labor. Some cadres and masses believed that "large-scale steel production makes it impossible to grow wheat well" and "strong laborers have all been transferred away, leaving behind old and disabled soldiers, making it impossible to grow wheat well." In response to the above situation, the county party committee publicized the current situation to cadres and masses, explaining the relationship between industry and agriculture and the favorable conditions for growing wheat well this year. They organized the masses to debate: While engaging in large-scale steel production, can we sow wheat well in terms of quality and quantity? Through debate, they overcame pessimistic emotions, raised their ideological awareness, and mustered their energy, unanimously expressing their determination to ensure good steel production and good wheat planting. Through investigation and calculation, a large number of laborers were discovered. Public canteens, nurseries, and livestock breeding, at the company and platoon levels, were merged, and a total of more than 8,800 laborers were extracted, including cadres from the communes, to participate in wheat planting; together with 20,000 semi-laborers and more than 30,000 cadres, teachers, and students, a total of 85,000 people in the county participated in wheat planting, solving the labor shortage. In addition to properly arranging labor, the county party committee also assigned a secretary and five committee members to specifically lead wheat planting, and wheat planting headquarters were established at both the county and township levels. Twenty-three wheat planting corps were established throughout the county, achieving military-style action, and implementing ten aspects on the field, including office work, telephones, nurseries, farm busy season canteens, and propaganda. Specialized personnel were fixed for tasks such as shaking seed drills, soaking and mixing seeds, delivering wheat seeds, making ridges, loosening soil, and preserving soil moisture. All ten people's communes in the county carried out a competition to pull out black flags and insert red flags, greatly promoting the wheat planting movement.

During wheat planting, the whole party and all the people were mobilized, everyone was full of energy, and no household was idle. Old people in their eighties and children of seven or eight years old participated in the battle. During the day, there were crowds of people and red flags waving, and at night there were lights everywhere. The Huagong People's Commune put forward the slogan: "The moon is the sun, the night is the day, the rain is good weather, one day is worth ten days, sowing 10,000 mu of wheat a day, and completing 50,000 mu of wheat in five days." In order to strive for the top, they kept drilling wheat day and night. Li Hengguang, the deputy secretary of the commune party committee, took the lead in rolling up his trousers, wading through the mud, and helping the masses pull and shake the seed drills when planting wheat in the lower Yellow River滩, sowing seven mu of wheat from morning to noon. The whole commune started sowing wheat on the 8th and had sown 45,000 mu by the 11th, winning the red flag. Wang Rongzhi, the battalion commander of the Liyi camp of the Chengba People's Commune, Wang Zhenduo, the instructor, and other ten comrades tied kerosene lamps to the seed drills and sowed wheat all night, sowing five mu of wheat in two hours, which motivated all companies. Li Xingren, a feeder from Donghanying, had sores on his feet, but insisted on participating in shaking the seed drill after the wheat planting began, and no one could stop him. He said: "Everyone is busy, I can't sit still. The whole country is making a great leap forward, and I have to do my part."

The characteristics of this year's wheat planting work in Meng County are: good preparation, fast planting, and good quality. The daily progress of wheat planting reached 35,000 mu, and the depth of the 280,000 mu of land that has been deeply ploughed is all above one chi and two cun, with an average application of more than 60,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu. The sown wheat is sown with more than 25 to 30 jin of fine seeds per mu. Each commune has established an inspection and acceptance committee. The planted wheat fields have been inspected and accepted with good quality, all achieving deep ploughing, fine seeds, close planting, timely planting, full seedlings, and no insects, achieving garden-like cultivation.

    口号响亮——明年小麦亩产五千斤
    孟县再争小麦王座
    行动有力——保质保量适时播完种
    据河南日报消息　著名全国的小麦高产区孟县（编者注：孟县是今年全国冬小麦产量最高的两个县之一，平均亩产六百斤以上。）的人民力争明年实现小麦五千斤县，掀起了适时播种保证质量的群众性的种麦高潮。今年三十五万亩麦播任务，至本月15日已基本种完。
    为了实现明年小麦五千斤县，孟县在水、肥、土、种等方面为种麦作了充分准备。在种麦开始时，全县七万五千多个劳力，有四万个强劳力参加大办钢铁，种麦劳力不足。部分干部和群众认为“大办钢铁就无法种好小麦”“强劳力都调走了，剩下老兵残将，无法种好麦”。县委针对以上情况，向干部和群众宣传了当前形势，讲明了工业与农业的关系和今年种好小麦的有利条件。组织群众辩论：在大办钢铁的同时，能不能按质按量种好小麦等问题。通过辩论，克服了悲观情绪，提高了思想觉悟，鼓足了干劲，一致表示保证搞好钢铁，并种好小麦。通过查算，挖掘出大批劳力。把连、排的公共食堂、托儿所、牲畜饲养等进行合并，连社干部在内，共抽出了八千八百多劳力参加种麦；连同两万个半劳力，和干部师生三万余人，全县参加种麦的共达八万五千人，解决了劳力不足困难。县委除妥善安排劳力外，又以一个书记、五个委员专门领导种麦，县、乡都成立了种麦指挥部。全县成立了二十三个种麦兵团，作到了行动军事化，实行了办公、电话、托儿所、农忙食堂、宣传等十到田。摇耧、浸种拌种、送麦种、打畦、松土保墒等工作都固定有专人负责。全县十个人民公社都开展了拔黑旗、插红旗的评比竞赛，大大推动了种麦运动。
    在种麦中，全党全民动员，个个干劲冲天，户户无闲人，八十岁的老人和七、八岁的儿童都参加了战斗。白天人山人海，红旗招展，夜晚一片灯光。化工人民公社提出了“月亮当太阳，黑夜当白天，下雨当好天，一天顶十天，一天种麦一万亩，五万亩麦五天完”的口号。他们为了力争上游，一天到晚不停耧。该公社党委第二书记李恒光在下黄河滩种麦时，带头卷起裤子，渡过淤泥，帮助群众拉耧、摇耧，从早晨到中午种了七亩小麦。全社8日开始种麦，11日已种四万五千亩，夺得红旗。城伯人民公社立义营营长王荣芝、教导员王振铎等十个同志在耧上绑着马灯，连夜种麦，两小时种麦五亩，带动了各连。东韩营饲养员李兴仁脚上长了疮，种麦开始后还要参加摇耧，谁也劝阻不住。他说：“大家都在忙，我坐不下去，全国都在大跃进，我有一分力量要尽一分力量。”
    孟县今年种麦工作的特点：准备得好，种得快，质量好。种麦日进度达三万五千亩，已深翻的二十八万亩地，深度都在一尺二寸以上，每亩平均施底肥六万多斤。已播种的小麦，每亩下良种都在二十五斤到三十斤以上。各公社都成立了检查验收委员会，已种麦田经检查验收质量良好，全部达到深翻、良种、密植、适时、全苗、无虫，作到园田化。
