Help High-Yield Wheat Fields Emerge With Good Seedlings

This year, various regions have sown wheat in high-yield "satellite fields." From our own "satellite fields," some technical problems have arisen after emergence. We are raising them here in the hope that everyone will pay attention.

	1. In our wheat fields where the sowing amount is over two million seeds per mu (about 150 jin), although the soil covering after broadcasting is only four centimeters (1.2 inches) thick, and the soil is relatively loose (clay loam mixed with one-third furnace ash), when the wheat seeds germinate intensively, the coleoptiles lift the surface soil, and the surface soil is isolated from the lower soil, forming a crust-like covering and creating patchy protrusions. In this case, if timely measures are not taken, some wheat seedlings will not be able to emerge and will form patchy areas of missing seedlings.

	In the southern regions of China, wheat is still in the sowing stage. To prevent the above phenomenon from occurring, attention should be paid to appropriately reducing the thickness of the soil covering. According to our experience, a soil covering thickness of two centimeters (0.6 inches), if the soil moisture is suitable, is conducive to the smooth emergence of wheat seedlings (in areas with winter frost damage, fine soil can be applied appropriately after emergence, or a layer of peat or stable manure can be used in winter to prevent frost). If the soil is heavy with clay, it is better to mix in some sand, furnace ash, peat, or well-decomposed and finely crushed compost. In the case of insufficient soil moisture, too shallow a soil covering will also affect emergence or lead to missing seedlings, so irrigation should be carried out before sowing.

	For some sown wheat fields, if the phenomenon of soil crust covering seedlings has occurred, and the soil crust thickness is around 1.5 centimeters (0.44 inches), a "hedgehog roller" or a nail-toothed harrow made of iron bars (tooth spacing of about 4 to 5 centimeters, too dense will easily injure the seedlings) can be used to break the soil crust, allowing the soil to fall back and facilitate the emergence of wheat seedlings. If the soil crust is above three centimeters (0.9 inches), it will not be easy to emerge even after the crust is broken. A layer of soil should be removed first, and then loosening should be carried out. The above measures should be carried out as early as possible. If the wheat buds have bent under the soil layer and the first leaf has protruded from the cotyledon sheath, the majority of the soil covering layer needs to be removed to help them emerge. These wheat seedlings that are artificially assisted in emergence are weaker, and attention should be paid to strengthening management.

	2. Satellite fields are all highly fertile soils, and they are prone to excessive growth. Some areas have sown too early, resulting in rampant growth. Varieties with stronger spring characteristics are at risk of jointing before winter. This phenomenon is detrimental to winter management and next year's production.

	In the southern regions of China where satellite fields have not yet been sown, attention should be paid to appropriately arranging the sowing period according to the spring characteristics of the varieties and the weather conditions of the year, and sowing should not be done too early. For some wheat fields that have already experienced rampant growth due to early sowing, if the soil is not excessively wet, methods such as rolling can be used to suppress growth; for some varieties with stronger spring characteristics that are at risk of jointing or have already jointed, a portion of the stems and leaves can be appropriately cut off, but the tillers of the stems should not be damaged (the height from the ground should be about three inches), and rolling should also be carried out. More attention should be paid to winter frost prevention and early spring management in these rampantly growing wheat fields.

    帮助高产麦田出好苗
    今年各地区都播种了小麦丰产“卫星田”，从我们自己的“卫星田”看，在出苗后发生了一些技术问题，特提出来希望大家注意。
    1、我们每亩播种量二百万粒（约一百五十斤）以上的麦田，撒播后复土厚度虽仅四厘米（一寸二分），土壤也比较疏松（粘壤土掺炉灰三分之一），但当麦种集中发芽时，芽鞘将表层土顶起，表层土与下层土隔离成为结壳状复盖，形成斑片状的突起。在这种情况下，假使不及时挽救，有些麦苗就不能出土而形成块状缺苗。
    我国南部地区小麦仍在播种阶段，为了防止发生以上现象，应注意适当减低复土厚度。根据我们的经验，复土厚度在二厘米（六分）时，如果土壤水分适宜，有利麦苗顺利出土，（冬季有冻害地区可在出苗后再适当施入细土，或采用冬季复盖一层草炭或厩肥等办法防冻）。假使土壤粘性重，混施一些沙子、炉灰、草炭或腐熟细碎的堆厩肥等更好。在土壤水分不足的情况下，如复土过浅也会影响出苗或缺苗，应在播种前灌溉。
    有些已播种的麦田，假使发生了土壳盖苗现象，土壳厚度在一点五厘米（四分四厘）左右时，可用“刺猬砘子”或铁条作成的钉齿耙子（齿距四至五厘米左右，太密易伤苗）打破土壳，使土壤回落，以利麦苗出土。假使土壳在三厘米（九分）以上时，破壳后也不易出苗，应先去掉一层土，再进行疏松。以上措施都要及早进行。假使麦芽已在土层下弯曲，且第一片叶子已突出子叶鞘时，就需要将复土层大部去掉来帮助它出土。这种用人工辅助出土的麦苗较弱，应注意加强管理。
    2、卫星田都是高度肥沃的土壤，很容易旺长，有些地区播种过早，因而发生了疯长现象，春性较强的品种在冬前有拔节的危险，这种现象对冬季管理和来年的生产都是不利的。
    在我国南部地区尚未播种的卫星田，应注意根据品种春性强弱及本年气象条件来适当安排播种期，不要过早播种。有些因播种过早已发生疯长现象的麦田，假使土壤不过分潮湿时，可采用镇压等方法来抑止生长；有些春性较强的品种有拔节的危险或已拔节时，可以适当地割掉一部分茎及叶，但不可伤及茎部的分蘖，（距地面高度应在三寸左右）同时并进行镇压。这种疯长的麦田更要注意冬季防冻及早春管理。
