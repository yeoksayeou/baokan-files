Studying Philosophy Increases Talent
Li Fenglu, Production Team Leader of Datong Coal Mine Machinery Manufacturing Plant

I've been working since I was a child and have over thirty years of experience. People always call me "Master," and I have some experience, but leading a production team is a bit tricky. When the team discusses problems, you say to do it this way, he says to do it that way. Which way is the right way to do it? I didn't have my own ideas. Especially since the Great Leap Forward, the production tasks have become even greater, and I feel that my burden is getting heavier and heavier. When I heard people say, "Marxism-Leninism is the guide for all work and can provide solutions," I had the idea of ​​studying theory. Later, when I heard that the factory was going to organize workers to study philosophy, I signed up.

Found the Root Cause of the Problem

After studying the lesson on "The Relationship Between the Subjective and the Objective," I realized my shortcomings in using simple and rigid working methods. I deeply felt that this leadership method was wrong and that I should proceed from reality, analyze specific situations, and patiently help them. Once, when assigning the task of shearing knife blades to Su Quand, he said, "Master Li, my lathe is big, and this job is small, I can't do it." I analyzed the actual situation of his lathe and felt that with some thought, it could be done. I asked Old Su, "What if you can't do it?" Old Su replied, "Let's give it to the shaper! The shaper first goes four hundred millimeters and then returns six hundred millimeters, which can solve the problem." I said to him, "You can think of a way for other lathes, why don't you think of a way for your own lathe? We have learned philosophy and understand the principle that the subjective can transform the objective, so we should proceed from reality and give full play to our subjective initiative!" I patiently helped him think of a way to clamp the screw pressure plate. In this way, Old Su smoothly completed the task of shearing knife blades. Then I praised him, and Old Su was very happy. He said, "Master Li's attitude towards us is better after studying philosophy." He also asked me to help him more in the future.

Analyze Contradictions, Resolve Contradictions

Philosophy says that there are contradictions everywhere, and everything has contradictions. As long as we specifically analyze the contradictions, we can find ways to resolve them and do our work well. I combined this with the problems in the team, thought about it carefully, and did it, and it was indeed correct. For example, after the factory leaders gave the three hundred planing machines in my team to the tool workshop, some people in our team had opinions and had a conflict with the tool workshop. I analyzed the specific situations of both sides of the contradiction: this machine is easy to use and works smoothly, and the comrades in the team all like it. Giving it to them means our team has even fewer lathes to use, this is one aspect; on the other hand, this machine is very suitable for the tool workshop to do small jobs, but it is only used for one shift a day, with two shifts idle, and its potential cannot be utilized. How to resolve this? I thought that taking the machine back would not only fail to resolve the contradiction, but would make the contradiction even greater. Therefore, I consulted with the section chief of the tool workshop and decided that they would use it in the early shift, and we would use it in the second and third shifts. In this way, the contradiction was resolved, and the role of the lathe was brought into play.

Although the study time is not long, I feel that studying philosophy can point us in the right direction and find ways to solve problems.

    学哲学长才干
    大同煤矿机械制造厂生产组长　李凤禄
    我自小就作工，有三十多年工龄了，人家总叫咱老师傅，论起经验也多少有一点，可是领导一个生产小组，就有点棘手。组里讨论问题时，你说这样做，他说那样办，究竟该怎做才对？自己没有个主张。特别是大跃进以来，生产任务更大了，感到自己的担子越来越重了。听到人家说：“马列主义是一切工作的指导，能给办法”，我就起了学习理论的念头。后来听厂里要组织工人学哲学，我就报名参加了。
    找到了病根子
    学习了“主观与客观的关系”一课后，我认识到自己工作方法简单、生硬的毛病。深深感到这种领导方法不对头，应该从实际出发，分析具体情况，耐心帮助他们。有一次给苏全德分配剪刀刃的活时，他说：“李师傅，我的车大，这活小，干不了。”我就分析了他的车床的实际情况，觉得想点办法，满可以做。我反问老苏：“不能干怎么办呢？”老苏回答：“给牛头刨床做去吧！牛头刨先走四百公厘，再回走六百公厘，就可以解决了”。我就对他说：“你能给别的车床想办法，为啥不给自己的车床想点办法呢？咱们学了哲学，懂得了主观能改造客观的道理，就应该从实际出发，发挥主观能动性呀！”又耐心地帮助他想了个办法，把螺丝压板卡住。这样，老苏就顺利地完成了剪刀刃活的任务。接着我又表扬他，老苏挺高兴。他说：“李师傅学了哲学后对我们的态度好了。”还要我以后多帮助他。
    分析矛盾　解决矛盾
    哲学上说：处处有矛盾，事事有矛盾，只要具体分析矛盾，就能找到解决矛盾的办法，做好工作。我结合组里的问题，细细一想、一做，确实不差。如厂里领导上把我组三百号刨车给了工具车间后，我们组里好些人有意见，跟工具车间发生了矛盾。我就分析了矛盾双方面的具体情况：这个车好使，干起活来利爽，组里同志都喜欢它，给了人家，组里车床也不够使了，这是一方面；另一方面，这车给工具车间做小活很合适，但每天只用一班，有两班闲着，不能发挥它的潜力。怎么解决呢？我想，把车要回来，不但不能解决矛盾，而且矛盾会更大。于是，我就找工具车间的股长商量，决定早班他们用，二班、三班我们使。这样，既解决了矛盾，又发挥了车床的作用。
    学习的时间虽然还不长，但我感到学习哲学能给我们指出正确的方向，找到解决问题的办法。
