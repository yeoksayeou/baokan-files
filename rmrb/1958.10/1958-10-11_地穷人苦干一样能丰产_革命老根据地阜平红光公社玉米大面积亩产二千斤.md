Even with poor land, hard work can still result in abundant harvests.

The Red Light People's Commune in the Old Revolutionary Base of Fuping Achieves Large-Scale Corn Yield of 2,000 Jin Per Mu

    (Our Dispatch) The 292 mu of summer corn planted by the Chengnanzhuang Production Team of the Red Light People's Commune in Fuping County achieved an overall bumper harvest this year. After harvesting and threshing, the total yield was 611,032 jin, with an average yield of 2,092.57 jin per mu. Among them, 52 mu of high-yield experimental fields reached a yield of over 3,000 jin per mu. A 1.32 mu high-yield plot achieved an average yield of 5,139.75 jin per mu. The average yield per mu increased by nearly six times compared to last year's yield of 321 jin per mu.

    This team is a key focus for corn yield cultivation by the Fuping County Committee of the Communist Party of China. The 1.32 mu high-yield experimental plot was personally cultivated by Li Rongsheng, Deputy Secretary of the County Committee, Wang Ying, First Secretary of the Township Party Committee, and Secretary Li Shigao. Fuping is a deep mountainous area with barren soil. The reason why this team's corn achieved an overall bumper harvest this year is mainly because the broad masses of cadres and commune members established a communist spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act. They strengthened the field management of crops in a timely manner, and prominently focused on key issues such as "water, fertilizer, soil, seeds, and density" in management measures. Before sowing, land selection was carried out universally, and all corn was planted in wheat fields with good water access. All planting was carried out with wide rows and close planting, with 2,500 to 2,800 plants per mu, and the high-yield fields reached 3,200 plants. Excellent varieties such as Jinhuanghou and Baimaya were used. After emergence, management was strengthened in a timely manner, and fertilizer was applied universally eight times, with high-yield fields receiving eleven applications. Combining fertilization with cultivation and watering, after the wheat harvest, shallow hoeing and ditch clearing were carried out first, followed by deep hoeing to eliminate stubble. Due to intercropping with wheat ridges, deep plowing was not possible. To make up for this, deep turning was carried out when the seedlings were one chi high, reaching a depth of eight cun to one chi. Water was applied a total of three times. Combining topdressing with watering, four cultivations were also carried out to ensure loose soil and six cun high ridges to prevent lodging. At the same time, diseases and pests were actively controlled, and artificial pollination was carried out universally three times to ensure full grains on every ear, ensuring a bumper harvest.

    地穷人苦干一样能丰产
    革命老根据地阜平红光公社玉米大面积亩产二千斤
    本报讯　阜平县红光人民公社城南庄生产队种植的二百九十二亩夏玉米，今年获得了全面丰收。经过收打，总产六十一万一千零三十二斤，平均亩产二千零九十二点五七斤。其中五十二亩丰产试验田，亩产达三千斤以上。有一点三二亩高额丰产田，平均亩产五千一百三十九点七五斤。平均亩产比去年亩产三百二十一斤提高了近六倍。
    该队是中共阜平县委培养的玉米丰产重点，其中一点三二亩高额丰产试验田，是由县委副书记李荣生同志、乡党委第一书记王瑛、书记李士高亲自培养的。阜平是一个土质贫瘠的深山区，今年这个队的玉米所以获得全面丰产，主要是广大干部和社员树立了敢想、敢说、敢干的共产主义精神，及时加强了作物的田间管理，在管理措施上，突出的抓住了“水、肥、土、种、密”等关键问题。在播种前普遍进行了土地选择，全部玉米种到了水地麦田。点种时全部实行了宽行密植，每亩二千五百至二千八百棵，丰产田达到三千二百棵。并采用了金黄后、白马牙优良品种。出苗后及时加强了管理，普遍追肥八次，高额丰产田追肥达十一次。结合施肥进行了中耕培土和浇水，麦收后，首先进行了浅锄、清垅，随后进行了深锄灭茬。由于麦垅套种，不能深耕，为补上这一课，在苗高一尺时进行了深翻，深达八寸到一尺。前后共浇水三次。结合追肥浇水，又进行了四次中耕培土，保证了土壤疏松，埂高六寸，防止了倒伏。同时，对病虫害也积极进行了除治，并普遍进行了三次人工授粉，保证穗穗籽粒饱满，保证了丰收。
