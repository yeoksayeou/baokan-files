Cast Steel Can Be Used to Make High-Pressure Reaction Kettles

    (Reported by this newspaper) Shanghai Turbine Factory, Shanghai Sifang Boiler Factory, Harbin Electric Machinery Factory, Shanghai municipal and Jinxi local factories have successively used cast steel instead of forging to manufacture high-pressure reaction kettles with an inner diameter of 420 mm and a wall thickness of 100 mm. After testing, the burst pressure reached 1,400 atmospheres, and some even reached 1,680 atmospheres. The one cast by Shanghai Turbine Factory reached as high as 1,990 atmospheres, which is the highest burst pressure of high-pressure reaction kettles manufactured in China.

    High-pressure reaction kettles are high-pressure containers in nitrogen fertilizer equipment and work under a pressure of 320 atmospheres. The technical requirements are relatively high, and the manufacturing is relatively difficult. In foreign countries, it is generally made of integral forgings, which need to be forged on 3,000 to 10,000-ton hydraulic presses. A relatively new method is the band-winding type, that is, special steel bands are wound layer by layer into a cylinder and then welded. Because of the lack of large forging equipment in China, integral forging is impossible. Other manufacturing methods are difficult to popularize the manufacturing of high-pressure vessels because of the labor-intensive manufacturing or the need for large-scale equipment. Therefore, how to manufacture high-pressure reaction kettles in accordance with China's actual conditions is an important task placed before machinery manufacturers.

    Can cast steel be used instead of forging to manufacture high-pressure reaction kettles? At that time, some people raised this question, and many people opposed it. Their reason was that they had never heard of or seen this method mentioned in books. Some people also said that the books said that casting can be used for medium and low pressure, but it is impossible for high-pressure reaction kettles with 320 atmospheres. However, under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee, the workers in Shanghai boldly used cast steel to manufacture high-pressure reaction kettles. After burst tests, it was proved that the burst test cylinders could withstand a pressure more than twice the working pressure. The cost of cast steel high-pressure vessels is only one-fifth of that of electric furnace cast steel or one-eighth of that of converter cast steel, which is a type that meets the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical results. This creates conditions for large, medium, and small factories to manufacture high-pressure reaction kettles. (Attached picture)

    铸钢可以造成高压反应筒
    本报讯　上海汽轮机厂、上海四方锅炉厂、哈尔滨电机厂、上海市和锦西的地方工厂先后以铸钢代替锻造制造成内径四百二十公厘、壁厚一百公厘的高压反应筒。经过试验，爆破压力达一千四百大气压，有的高达一千六百八十大气压，上海汽轮机厂铸造的竟高达一千九百九十大气压，是我国制造的高压反应筒爆破压力最高的一个。
    高压反应筒是氮肥设备中的高压容器，在三百二十大气压力下工作，技术要求比较高，制造比较困难。在国外一般是采用整体锻件，需要在三千到一万吨水压机上进行锻造。比较新式的方法是绕带式的，也就是将特制的钢带一层层缠绕成筒然后焊接制成。由于我国大型锻压设备缺乏，采用整体锻造是不可能的，采用其他的制造方法，由于制造费工，或由于需要大型的设备，都难以使高压容器制造遍地开花。因此，如何结合我国实际情况制造高压反应筒是摆在机械制造者面前的重要任务。
    能否用铸钢代替锻造制造高压反应筒呢？当时有人提出了这个问题，就有许多人反对，他们的理由是从未听说过或看到过书本上讲到这种方法。也有人说，书上讲过中压低压还可以用铸造，像三百二十大气压的高压反应筒是不可能的。但是上海的工人们在上海市委的领导下，大胆地以铸钢制造高压反应筒。经过爆破试验，证明经过爆破的试样筒都能担负工作压力两倍以上的压力。铸钢高压容器的成本只有电炉铸钢的五分之一或转炉铸钢的八分之一，是一种符合多快好省的型式，这就为大中小厂都制造高压反应筒创造了条件。（附图片）
