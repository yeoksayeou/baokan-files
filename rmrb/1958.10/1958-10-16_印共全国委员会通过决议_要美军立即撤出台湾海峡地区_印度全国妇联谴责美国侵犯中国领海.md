    The resolution pointed out that the Chinese government's order to cease shelling Jinmen "has won the praise of people of all countries." The National Committee called on all parties and groups that support Afro-Asian solidarity to launch a national movement to support India's demand: the United States withdraw from the Taiwan area; restore the legitimate seat of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations.

    The meeting passed a report on the situation of farmers and grain production and about twelve resolutions on international and domestic issues, and put forward ten solutions to the current land problems in India.
