Establish an Educational Network from Elementary to Advanced Levels
Li Rufan, Director of Changchun Asbestos Factory

Under the instruction of the higher Party committee and the urgent demands of all employees, our factory established on September 5th an Asbestos Workers' College that combines education with production labor, politics with technical culture, and spare-time education with part-work and part-study. We have established a complete employee education system from elementary (literacy) to advanced (university) levels. All employees will enter university by 1965.

Currently, 50% of our factory's employees have an educational level at or below elementary school, and 5% are at or above senior high school. Based on this reality, the Asbestos Workers' College has a primary department, an intermediate department, a senior department, and a part-work and part-study class, as well as an affiliated Asbestos Industrial Technology Research Institute. The senior department has five departments: Asbestos Rubber, Asbestos Plastics, Insulating Paper, Electrical Machinery, and Enterprise Management. We also plan to open correspondence courses within the year and enroll one or two new classes next year. The duration of study for all departments is three years. The intermediate department is a preparatory class for the senior department. All employees with a primary school graduation level of education participate in intermediate department studies. They participate in cultural studies on the one hand, and professional studies according to their work needs on the other. After four years of study, the intermediate department will reach the graduation level of a secondary vocational school, and then enter the senior department for study. The primary department absorbs illiterate employees and those with an elementary school education. It is planned to eliminate illiteracy completely before November of this year. An employee who becomes literate will reach the graduation level of a secondary vocational school after six years of study. In this way, the entire factory will achieve universal higher education in seven years (i.e., 1965), and by the end of 1967, everyone will have a higher education level.

In order to closely combine education with production, labor with technology, we have planned that in addition to starting professional knowledge learning from the intermediate department, we have also established an Asbestos Industrial Technology Research Institute. It consists of 38 researchers, including Party and government leaders within the factory, engineering and technical personnel, and most of the experienced veteran technicians. They participate in learning while conducting technical research on production. The basic tasks of the research institute are, on the one hand, to study production technology, solve key production problems, trial-produce new products, innovate operating procedures, and improve process design, so that technical research is closely integrated with production, ensuring the smooth completion of production tasks and promoting continuous production development. On the other hand, it also undertakes teaching research, textbook writing, and other learning tasks.

In order to combine universal improvement with key training, we have adopted a method of combining spare-time education with part-work and part-study. In addition to universally participating in spare-time learning in each department, we have also specifically established a part-work and part-study class. It is composed of 30 people selected from labor models above the fifth grade worker level and advanced producers, who are veteran technicians with excellent qualities and potential for development. The plan is for this group of people to reach the level of technicians and engineers in technology and approach the level of university graduates in culture by 1962. Currently, there are no asbestos product majors in colleges and universities, and part-work and part-study is the only reliable way to solve this contradiction. By 1962, they will become an asbestos professional technical team that has both rich practical experience and high-level cultural and scientific theoretical knowledge, able to handle both literary and military matters, both red and expert, and capable and efficient.

Regarding textbooks and teachers, we adopt a method of self-reliance and a combination of indigenous and foreign methods. In the arrangement of courses, we adopt teaching according to aptitude and a combination of politics, technology, and culture. The primary department and the part-work and part-study class focus on learning culture, supplemented by political theory, while the intermediate and senior departments emphasize politics, culture, and professional technology in parallel. In terms of textbooks, we adopt the method of consistent learning and application, learning what is done, closely combining production and learning, and combining workers' actual operating skills with technicians' theoretical knowledge (including textbook knowledge). According to the specific situation of our factory, professional and technical course textbooks adopt a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, and engineering and technical personnel and workers combine to write textbooks and books. At the end of the year, at least two books (Asbestos Industry, Asbestos Machinery) will be published.

The sources of teachers for professional courses are engineers and technicians on the one hand, and veteran workers on the other. In addition to the five full-time teachers in our factory, we are linked with the district's night university, junior normal school, and No. 18 Middle School. They help us solve the teacher problem, and we help them build satellite factories for gaskets and synthetic rubber.

We firmly believe that with the correct leadership of the Party and the encouragement of the General Line, coupled with the people's enthusiasm for learning, the universalization of higher education in our country in ten to fifteen years will surely be achieved victoriously ahead of schedule.

    建立从初级到高级的教育网
    长春石棉工厂厂长　李如帆
    根据上级党委的指示和全体职工的迫切要求，我厂已于9月5日办起了一所教育与生产劳动、政治与技术文化、业余教育与半工半读相结合的又红又专的石棉工学院，建立起一套从初级（扫盲）到高级（大学）的完整的职工教育体系。职工将于1965年全部进入大学。
    我厂现有的职工，文化程度在初小以下的占50％，高中以上的占5％，根据这一现实情况，石棉工学院共设有初级部、中级部、高级部和半工半读班，并附设一个石棉工业技术研究所。高级部设石棉橡胶、石棉塑料、绝缘纸、电机和企业管理五个系，还计划年内开函授班，明年招收一班到二班新生，学制均为三年。中级部是高级部的预备班，凡具有高小毕业文化程度的职工，均参加中级部学习，他们一方面参加文化学习，另方面根据各自工作的需要，进行专业学习。中级部经过四年的学习将达到中等专业学校毕业水平，然后进入高级部学习。初级部吸收文盲和小学文化程度的职工参加。计划在今年11月份以前全部扫除文盲，一个脱盲的职工经过六年的学习，将达到中等专业学校毕业的水平，这样全厂将于七年（即1965年）普及高等教育，到1967年末人人都将具有高等的教育程度。
    为了做到教育与生产、劳动与技术紧密结合，我们规划除由中级部即开始进行专业知识的学习外，还成立了一个石棉工业技术研究所。它是由厂内的党政领导、工程技术人员和大部分具有丰富实际经验的老技术工人共三十八名研究员组成的。他们一边参加学习，一边进行生产的技术研究工作。研究所的基本任务，一方面是研究生产技术，解决生产关键问题，试制新产品，革新操作规程，改进工艺设计，使技术研究与生产紧密结合起来，保证生产任务的顺利完成，促进生产不断发展。另方面也担负着教学研究、编写教材等学习方面的任务。
    为了使普遍提高和重点培养结合起来，我们采取了业余教育与半工半读相结合的方法，各部除普遍参加业余学习外，又专门成立了一个半工半读班。它是从五级工以上的劳动模范、先进生产者当中，具有培养前途的品质优秀的老技术工人当中抽出三十人组成的。计划这部分人到1962年，在技术上达到技术员工程师水平，在文化上接近大学毕业水平。目前大专学校都没有石棉制品专业，半工半读就是解决这一矛盾的唯一可靠方法。到1962年他们就将成为既有丰富的实际经验，又有高度的文化科学理论知识，能文能武、又红又专、精明强干的石棉专业技术队伍了。
    在教材和师资问题方面，我们采取自力更生、土洋结合的方法。在课程的安排上采取因材施教，政治、技术、文化三结合。初级部和半工半读班，重点学习文化，辅以政治理论，中级部和高级部，政治、文化和专业技术并举。在教材方面采取学用一致、即做什么学什么，生产与学习紧密结合和工人的实际操作技术与技术人员的理论知识（包括课本知识）相结合的方法。根据本厂的具体情况，专业技术课教材采取土洋结合，工程技术人员与工人结合起来编写教材、著书。到年末最低出版两本书（石棉工业、石棉机械）。
    专业课的师资来源，一是工程技术人员，二是老工人，文化课的师资除本厂有五名专职教员外，我们与区的夜大学、初级师范和十八中学等学校挂钩，他们帮助我们解决教师问题，我们帮助他们办垫圈、人造橡胶等卫星工厂。
    我们深深相信，有党的正确领导和总路线的鼓舞，再加上觉悟了的人民学习的热劲，十年到十五年普及我国的高等教育，一定会预期或提前胜利实现的。
