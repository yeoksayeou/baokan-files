    Piercing the Painted Skin of America's "Commitment to Glorious Peace"
    Sun Ying
    The serious military provocations carried out by the American aggressors against the Chinese people in the Taiwan Strait area have been severely condemned by fair-minded public opinion around the world, leaving the United States in an extremely isolated and embarrassing position. In order to defend their crimes of aggression, Eisenhower and Dulles have repeatedly professed themselves, saying that the United States is seeking a peaceful solution to the Taiwan issue, and they have even shamelessly stated: The United States "has traditionally been passionately committed to a glorious peace, as it is now. We will never use force to resolve differences except to resist aggression."
    They also said that the United States' announcement of its occupation of Taiwan on June 27, 1950, was due to "the Communist army attacking and attempting to conquer the Republic of Korea. At that time, President Truman announced his intention to protect Taiwan." The "security" of Taiwan "is of utmost importance to the security of the United States and the free world." Therefore, the large-scale increase of American troops in Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait area, the intrusion into China's territorial waters, internal waters, and airspace, and the interference in the Chinese people's punishment of the Chiang Kai-shek army are "purely for defense," are the implementation of "individual and collective self-defense," and are the fulfillment of "treaty obligations" to a "friendly country."
    They also said that the United States "has a collective defense treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek clique; they still refer to the Chiang gang as the so-called "Republic of China," claiming that the Chiang Kai-shek clique is an "autonomous" country with the right to "sign treaties." The actions of the American military in Taiwan "have been agreed to by that government," so it is not aggression.
    All these defenses serve a central purpose: to try their best to conceal the hideous face of American imperialism. However, this set of methods used by the United States is just like the demon in the old novel "Liaozhai," who puts on a painted skin and transforms into a beautiful woman, and is easily exposed.
    The American gentlemen say that they have a "tradition" of dedicating themselves to peace, but people only need to simply examine history to know that as early as 1844, the United States forced the Qing Dynasty government of China to sign the Treaty of Wangxia. The Treaty of Wangxia was the first unequal treaty among imperialist countries that forced China to grant extraterritoriality and accept American missionaries. This means that the United States is an old-brand imperialist. Since then, American warships participated in the Anglo-French allied forces' invasion of China, assisted Japan in attacking Taiwan, participated in the Eight-Nation Alliance, signed the Lansing-Ishii Agreement with Japan, and, together with Britain, created the "Xiaguan Massacre" to suppress the Chinese Great Revolution. Between 1931 and 1933, the United States used loans, airplanes, and military advisers to help the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek government attack the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. After Japan surrendered, the United States used billions of dollars to help the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek government launch a full-scale civil war against the Chinese people. For more than a hundred years, the United States has been running rampant in China. It was not until 1949 that the American aggressive forces were driven out of mainland China by the Chinese people. The White Paper published by the U.S. State Department in August 1949 admitted the bankruptcy of its China policy. This China policy of the United States is nothing but the American policy of aggression against China. In the face of such bloody historical facts, people can see that what the United States is "passionately dedicated to" has no peace whatsoever, but a thorough and complete colonialist aggressive "tradition"!
    It is the same for China as it is for other parts of the world. In an article published in the December 17, 1954, issue of "U.S. News & World Report," the author not only proved that "U.S. troops had invaded China," but also, according to the author's statistics, "The United States has sent troops into the territory of other countries more than 140 times in order to protect its own citizens and interests." People can clearly remember that one of the most prominent crimes in the history of American aggression was the annexation of the Philippines by the United States. In order to plunder colonies, the United States provoked a war against the old colonialist country of Spain in 1898 and seized Cuba, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Hawaiian Islands from the Spanish colonists. When the United States attacked the Spaniards in the Philippines, it relied on the Filipino people's uprising against slavery to defeat the Spaniards. The United States then wrote a check allowing the Filipinos to be independent. However, when it came time to sign a treaty with Spain, the United States created a clause in the treaty stipulating that the United States would use $20 million to buy the Philippines from the Spaniards and incorporate the Philippines into the United States. And it was based on this "treaty obligation" that it broke its promise and carried out a brutal suppression of the Filipino people who were striving for independence. Are these histories not the greatest satire of the so-called American claim that it "never uses force to resolve differences?" American history proves that the United States has traditionally been a ferocious imperialist.
    As for what the United States is "doing now," it can also be seen from the new experiences of the Chinese people. Eight years ago, the United States occupied our territory of Taiwan in an undeclared war; the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea, attempting to threaten and attack our Northeast; the United States interfered in the Indochina War, attempting to gain a foothold there and establish a base for aggression against southern China; the United States insisted on its policy of non-recognition of the People's Republic of China, hostile to the Chinese people, and illegally deprived our country of its seat in the United Nations; the United States imposed an embargo on our country, attempting to strangle the new China with an economic blockade; the United States airdropped special agents, and has been carrying out subversive activities against our country. Even to the point that recently, it has mobilized a large number of warships, aircraft, and missile units, concentrating them in Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait area, carrying out military threats and war provocations against us, and wanting to expand its scope of aggression to Jinmen, Mazu, and other islands of our Fujian Province. American warships and aircraft have continuously intruded into our territorial waters and airspace. Are all these not aggressive acts of hostility towards China? Yet the United States describes these aggressive acts as "defense" or so-called "individual and collective self-defense." May I ask what military attack China has launched against the United States, which is ten thousand kilometers away? Have the Chinese people sent troops and planes to attack American airspace and territorial waters? Have they occupied an inch of American territory? None of this has happened! Instead, the United States has long occupied our territory of Taiwan, and the Chiang Kai-shek army under the direction of the United States is entrenched on the coastal islands of Jinmen and Mazu, and since this year, it has greatly increased its troops. A few years ago, there were only 40,000 Chiang troops on these islands, but now there are 115,000. What kind of "defense" and "self-defense" is this?
    Under what pretext did the United States occupy our territory of Taiwan? The United States said that this was "due to the Communist army attacking and attempting to conquer the Republic of Korea on June 27, 1950. At that time, President Truman announced his intention to protect Taiwan." In this way, it seems that the United States' occupation of our territory of Taiwan was an act of "defense" after being attacked. However, here, in addition to reversing right and wrong (Dulles deliberately obliterated the crime of directing Syngman Rhee to launch the "northward" war and personally going to the front lines of the 38th parallel to arrange the war, attempting to shift the responsibility for launching the war onto the Korean people), he also played a clumsy trick. Because everyone knows that when the United States launched the war of aggression against Korea, the Chinese people did not participate in the war. Only when the United States occupied Taiwan, and disregarding the repeated warnings of the Chinese people, its aggressive troops crossed the 38th parallel and pushed all the way to the Yalu River, directly threatening the security of our Northeast, did the Chinese people finally become unbearable and resolutely resist the United States, aid Korea, protect their homes and defend their country, and send their own volunteers to fight the American aggressors together with the Korean people. This point was even clearly admitted by Dulles in his speech on September 25, "since December 1950, Communist China has attacked the United Nations forces in Korea." So, what reason did the United States have to take unwarranted aggression against China on June 27, 1950, and occupy China's territory of Taiwan? What kind of "defense" is this!
    The American occupation of our territory of Taiwan is a completely undisguisable act of aggression. However, now, the United States is sophistically saying that this is a "treaty obligation" "undertaken" according to the US-Chiang "Common Defense Treaty." What kind of "treaty obligation" is this? The United States occupied Taiwan as early as June 27, 1950, while the US-Chiang treaty was only fabricated on December 2, 1954. The United States actually wants to reverse the dates. Saying that the United States is "protecting" Taiwan is based on "treaty obligations," but this "treaty" did not exist at all during the three years or more before the American military occupied Taiwan. From this one fact, it can be clearly seen that the American occupation of Taiwan and the "protection" of Taiwan did not come about based on any "treaty obligations," but rather, before there was a "treaty," it had already occupied Taiwan by force. Then, the so-called actions based on "treaty obligations," the so-called actions with the consent of a "friendly government" that do not constitute "acts of aggression," and the so-called right to "protect Taiwan" based on "treaty obligations" and to implement "individual and collective self-defense," all these tricks are nothing but self-deception. The facts are all there. No matter how the United States defends itself, fair-minded public opinion around the world knows this very clearly, unanimously recognizing that Taiwan is Chinese territory and denouncing the United States for aggressing upon Chinese territory and sovereignty.
    However, the American aggressors actually think that they have found a magic weapon to expand aggression based on these "treaty obligations." The U.S. Congress made a joint resolution authorizing the President not only to use American armed forces to protect Taiwan, but also to use American armed forces to "secure and protect related positions and territories in that area now held by friends, which he considers necessary or appropriate to guarantee Taiwan, and take other measures he considers necessary or appropriate to guarantee the defense of Taiwan." As a result, with the permission of the United States, the Chiang Kai-shek clique concentrated more than 110,000 troops on the coastal islands of Jinmen and Mazu in Fujian Province, constantly harassing the mainland and using them as a springboard for "counterattacking" the mainland. When the Chinese people severely punished the rampant Chiang Kai-shek troops on these islands, the United States invoked the Congressional resolution to "protect" and "secure" Jinmen and Mazu. For this reason, the United States concentrated an unprecedentedly large armed force to carry out military provocations and war threats against the Chinese people.
    And under the military threat of the United States, the United States proposed a "ceasefire" proposal, openly wanting to expand its "treaty obligations" to Jinmen and Mazu, and even to the mainland, vainly attempting to force our country to remove its defensive forces from Xiamen, Fuzhou, and the coastal areas. If the American "ceasefire" is accepted, then, whenever there is a need in the future, the United States can arbitrarily create various excuses to destroy the "ceasefire" and launch an attack on our mainland based on "treaty obligations."
    This is how the American aggressors first created the fact of occupying our territory of Taiwan, and later created a "treaty" to "defend" this land that it had occupied by force; with this "treaty," they further expanded the scope of aggression to Jinmen and Mazu based on this "treaty obligation." Now, they are creating the conspiracy of a "ceasefire" so that they can expand the scope of aggression to the Chinese mainland and any place they attempt to invade at will in the future.
    Faced with this endless aggressive ambition of the United States, faced with the threat of the United States' powerful armed forces, isn't it a just action for the Chinese people to demand that the American troops withdraw from China's territory of Taiwan, in order to safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity, and to eliminate the threat of war, which any sovereign country must take? A just cause enjoys abundant support, while an unjust cause finds little support. The governments and people of Asian and African countries have unanimously condemned the American acts of aggression and demanded that American troops withdraw; on the other hand, even members of the American military bloc, Thailand and the Philippines, dare not agree with the American provocations against China, and have repeatedly stated that they have no obligations to Taiwan and will not be involved in the war provoked by the United States.
    However, American imperialism does not immediately withdraw its armed forces in Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait area according to world opinion, as it says it is committed to "peaceful solutions," but instead finds all sorts of excuses to stubbornly say that the Chinese people's liberation of their own territory of Taiwan and the coastal islands is "heinous" "aggression against other countries' territories" and is to "force a sovereign country to hand over its own territory." However, people all over the world know that the Chinese people have long established the People's Republic of China. This great country has stood in the world for nine years. And just two months ago, a memorandum from the U.S. State Department stubbornly said that this country did not exist, and said that it would "disappear" one day. However, a month later, the leader of the State Department, Dulles, in a speech on September 25, could not help but admit: "We do not insist that the Communist Chinese regime does not exist. We know, at great cost, that it does exist." Does the United States still need to pay an even greater price before being forced to know that Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen, and Mazu are all Chinese territories, and that the Chinese people must and will be able to liberate their own territories and realize the unification of the entire country? What right does the United States have to use the "treaty" signed with the Chiang Kai-shek clique as an excuse to obstruct the Chinese people from continuing the great cause of unifying the entire China?
    In short, reversing right and wrong can never change the facts. The American crimes of aggression cannot be denied by any sophistry. Now, the American policy of strength and brinkmanship has once again run into a wall in front of the powerful Chinese people; the "ceasefire" conspiracy it is playing has also run into a wall, leaving only the posture of a schoolmaster who "does not retreat in the face of force." But the crux of the problem will not be changed by any excuses made by the United States. In the past, now, and in the future, there is no such thing as the United States "retreating in the face of force." On the contrary, the real problem is that the United States has moved its armed forces from the East Pacific to the West Pacific, ten thousand kilometers away, to carry out aggression and military threats against the Chinese people! If the United States truly never uses force to resolve problems, then, instead of playing the "ceasefire" conspiracy, it should first stop its war provocations and withdraw all American armed forces from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait. We must pierce the various painted skins of the American aggressors and force the American aggressors to seriously discuss specific measures for the withdrawal of American armed forces from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait in the Warsaw talks.

    戳破美国“致力于光荣的和平”的画皮
    孙英
    美国侵略者在台湾海峡地区对中国人民进行严重的军事挑衅已经遭到了全世界公正舆论的严厉谴责，使得美国陷于十分孤立的狼狈境地。艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯为了辩解自己的侵略罪行，一再表白自己，说美国是在寻求用和平办法解决台湾问题，他们还厚着脸皮说：美国“在传统上一向是热情致力于光荣的和平，就像它现在所做的一样，我们决不使用武力来解决分歧，除非为了抵抗侵略。”
    他们又说：1950年6月27日美国宣布侵占台湾，是由于“共军攻击并企图征服大韩民国。当时杜鲁门总统宣布打算保护台湾”。台湾的“安全对于美国和自由世界的安全是极其重要的”，因而，把美国大举增兵台湾和台湾海峡地区，侵入中国领海、内海和领空，干涉中国人民对蒋介石军队的惩罚，是“纯粹为了防御”，是实行“单独的和集体的自卫”，是对一个“友好国家”所承担的“条约义务”。
    他们还说：美国同蒋介石集团“订有集体防御条约”；他们把蒋帮仍然称为所谓“中华民国”，说什么蒋介石集团是一个“自主”国家，有权“签订条约”。美军在台湾的行动“得到该政府同意”，所以不是侵略。
    所有这些辩解，都为了一个中心目的，这就是他们极力要掩盖美国帝国主义的狰狞面目。然而美国的这一套手法，正好像旧小说“聊斋”所描写的那个吃人的魔鬼披上一张画皮变作美女一样，是很容易被戳破的。
    美国的先生们说，他们有致力于和平的“传统”，可是人们只要简单查考一下历史就知道，早在1844年，美国就强迫中国清朝政府签订了望厦条约。望厦条约是帝国主义国家中第一个强迫中国给予治外法权和接受美国人传教的不平等条约。这就是说，美国是老牌的帝国主义者。此后美国军舰参加了英法联军侵略中国的行动，协助日本进攻台湾，参加八国联军，同日本签订蓝辛石井协定，同英国一起制造了镇压中国大革命的“下关惨案”，在1931—1933年间，美国曾用贷款、飞机和军事顾问帮助蒋介石反动政府进攻中国工农红军。日本投降后，美国用几十亿美元，帮助蒋介石反动政府发动了进攻中国人民的全面内战。一百多年期间，美国一直在中国横行霸道。直到1949年，美国的侵略势力才被中国人民驱逐出中国大陆。1949年8月美国国务院发表的白皮书，供认了对华政策的破产。美国的这个对华政策不是别的，就是美国侵略中国的政策。在这样血淋淋的历史事实面前，人们可以看到，美国所“热情致力”的没有丝毫的和平可言，而是彻头彻尾的殖民主义的侵略“传统”！
    对中国如此，对世界各地也是如此。1954年12月17日出版的“美国新闻与世界报道”上刊登的一篇文章中，作者不但证明“美国部队曾侵入中国”，而且据作者统计“美国为了保护自己的公民和利益，曾把军队开进他国领土，已经有一百四十次以上了”。人们能够清楚地记得，在美国的侵略史中，最突出的罪行之一，就是美国并吞菲律宾。美国为了掠夺殖民地，在1898年挑起对于老的殖民主义国家西班牙的战争，并从西班牙殖民者手里，夺取了古巴和菲律宾、波多黎各、关岛、夏威夷群岛。当美国在菲律宾进攻西班牙人的时候，曾经依靠了菲律宾人民反对奴役的起义而打败了西班牙人。美国当时开了允许菲律宾人独立的支票。可是，等到同西班牙签订和约的时候，美国却在条约里制造一条，规定美国用两千万美元从西班牙人手里买了菲律宾，把菲律宾并入了美国。并且就根据这个“条约义务”，背信弃义，对争取独立的菲律宾人民进行了残暴的镇压。这些历史难道对于所谓美国“决不用武力解决分歧”的鬼话不是最大的讽刺！美国的历史证明了在传统上美国一向是凶恶的帝国主义者。
    至于谈到美国“现在所做的”，也可以从中国人民的新经历来看一下。在八年以前，美国不宣而战地武装占领了我国的领土台湾；美国发动侵略朝鲜的战争，企图威胁和进攻我国东北；美国干涉印度支那战争，企图在那里插足，建立对我国南部的侵略基地；美国坚持不承认中华人民共和国的敌视中国人民的政策，非法剥夺我国在联合国的席位；美国对我国实行禁运，想以经济封锁来扼杀新中国；美国空投特务，一直在对我国进行颠复活动。以至到了最近，调集大批军舰、飞机和导弹部队，集中到台湾和台湾海峡地区，对我进行军事威胁和战争挑衅，要把它的侵略范围扩大到我国福建省的金门、马祖等岛屿，美国的军舰和飞机不断侵入我国领海领空，所有这些不是敌视中国的侵略行为吗？而美国却把这种侵略行为一概说成是“防御”或所谓“单独的和集体的自卫”。试问远在中国一万公里以外的美国，遭到中国的什么武力攻击了呢？中国人民派了军队、飞机去攻击美国的领空、领海了吗？霸占了美国的一寸领土了吗？都没有！而是美国长期霸占了我国的领土台湾，而是美国指使下的蒋介石军队，盘踞我国沿海的岛屿金门和马祖，并且从今年以来，大举增兵。几年以前这些岛上蒋军不过四万人，现在增加到了十一万五千人。这是什么“防御”和“自卫”呢？
    美国是在什么借口下，侵占我国领土台湾的呢？美国说，这是“由于1950年6月27日共军攻击并企图征服大韩民国。当时，杜鲁门总统宣布打算保护台湾。”这样看来，美国之所以占领我国领土台湾，是受到了攻击之后的“防御”行为了。可是，在这里，美国除了颠倒了是非以外（杜勒斯故意抹煞了在指使李承晚发动“北进”战争，曾亲自到三八线的前沿阵地去布置战争的罪行，企图把发动战争的责任推到朝鲜人民的身上），还玩弄了一个拙劣的手法。因为谁都知道，当美国发动侵朝战争的时候，中国人民并未参加战争。只是在美国占领了台湾，并且不顾中国人民的一再警告，它的侵略军队越过三八线，一直推向鸭绿江边，直接威胁到我国东北的安全的时候，中国人民才忍无可忍，奋起抗美援朝，保家卫国，派出了自己的志愿军，同朝鲜人民一起抗击美国侵略者。这一点，连杜勒斯在9月25日的演说里也明明白白地承认“是从1950年12月共产党中国在朝鲜进攻联合国军”的。那么，美国有什么理由在1950年6月27日就对中国采取了无端的侵略，霸占了中国的领土台湾呢？这叫什么“防御”呢！
    美国霸占我国领土台湾，完全是一种无法掩饰的侵略行为。可是，现在，美国又狡辩说，这是根据美蒋的“共同防御条约”所“承担”的“义务”。这是什么样的“条约义务”呢？美国早在1950年6月27日侵占了台湾，而美蒋条约，却是在1954年12月2日才制造出来的。美国竟想把日子倒算回去。说什么美国“保护”台湾，是根据的“条约义务”，而这个“条约”，在美军侵占台湾的前三年多里，却是根本不存在的东西。从这一个事实里可以清楚地看出，美国侵占台湾和“保护”台湾，并非根据什么“条约义务”而来，而是在有了“条约”之前，对台湾早就已经武装占领于先。那么，所谓的根据“条约义务”，所谓得到“友好政府”同意的行动，不构成“侵略行为”，以及根据“条约义务”，有权“保护台湾”，实行“单独和集体的自卫”等等，所有这些花腔，都不过是自欺欺人。事实俱在，不管美国怎样辩解，全世界公正舆论都十分清楚地知道这一点，一致公认台湾是中国的领土，指斥美国侵略了中国的领土和主权。
    然而，美国侵略者竟根据这些“条约义务”，以为找到了扩大侵略的法宝。美国国会作出联合决议，授权总统，不仅可以用美国武装部队来保护台湾，而且可以用美国武装部队来“确保和保护他认为是保证台湾所必需或适当的、现在在朋友手中的该地区有关阵地和领土，并且采取他认为是保证保卫台湾所必需或适当的其他措施”。于是，在美国准许下，蒋介石集团集中了十一万多部队到福建沿海岛屿金门和马祖等岛屿上，不断骚扰大陆，并据以作为“反攻”大陆的跳板。当中国人民严惩这些岛上的猖狂的蒋介石军队的时候，美国就援引了国会决议要来“保护”和“确保”金门、马祖了。美国为此集中了空前庞大的武装力量，对中国人民进行军事挑衅和战争威胁。
    而在美国的军事威胁之下，美国又提出“停火”的建议，公然要把他的“条约义务”扩大到金门、马祖，并且要扩大到大陆上来，妄想迫使我国撤除厦门、福州和沿海地区的防御力量。如果接受了美国的“停火”，以后，一旦有需要的时候，美国就可以任意制造什么破坏“停火”的各种借口，根据“条约义务”，向我大陆发动进攻了。
    美国侵略者就是这样，先造成了侵占我国领土台湾的事实，以后，制造出一个“条约”来“保卫”这个被它武装侵占了的土地；有了这个“条约”，又依据这个“条约义务”进一步把侵略范围扩大到金马。现在，正在制造“停火”的阴谋，使它在日后可以随心所欲地把侵略范围扩大到中国大陆和任何他所企图侵略的地方去。
    面对着美国这种无止境的侵略野心，面对着美国的强大的武装力量的威胁，中国人民要美国军队撤出中国的领土台湾，难道不是任何一个主权国家为了维护主权和领土的完整，为了消除战争的威胁，所必须采取的正义行动吗？得道者多助，失道者寡助。亚非各国的政府和人民，都一致谴责美国的侵略行为，要求美军撤走；而另一方面，甚至连美国军事集团的成员，泰国和菲律宾，对美国侵略中国的挑衅也不敢苟同，一再声明对台湾没有义务，将不卷入美国所挑起的战争。
    可是，美帝国主义并不像它所说的致力于“和平解决的方法”，立即按照世界舆论，撤退在台湾和台湾海峡地区的武装部队，而是找出种种借口，硬说中国人民要解放自己的领土台湾和沿海岛屿是“万恶”的“侵略它国领土”，是要“一个主权国家交出自己的领土”。可是，全世界人民都知道，中国人民早建立了中华人民共和国。这个伟大的国家，屹立于世界上已经九年了。而就在二个月以前，美国国务院的备忘录里还硬说这个国家是不存在的，并且说它总有一日将会“消失”的。可是，一个月以后，国务院的领导人杜勒斯，在9月25日的一篇演说里，竟也不得不承认：“我们并不硬说中共政权并不存在。我们在付出重大代价的情况下知道，它的确是存在的。”难道，美国还必需再付出更大的代价，才能被迫知道台湾、澎湖、金门和马祖都是中国的领土，中国人民一定要并且一定能够解放自己的领土，实现全国的统一的吗？美国有什么权利借口什么同蒋介石集团签订的“条约”来阻挠中国人民继续统一全中国的伟大事业呢？
    总之，颠倒是非是永远改变不了事实的。美国侵略的罪行是任何狡辩也抵赖不了的。现在，在美国的实力政策，战争边缘政策，又一次在强大的中国人民面前碰了壁；它所玩弄的“停火”的阴谋也碰了壁，只剩下一个什么“不在武力面前退却”的教师爷的架式了。但是问题的症结却不会由于美国制造任何借口而改变。过去、现在，以至将来，并不存在一个什么要美国“在武力面前退却”的问题，偏偏相反，现实的问题是美国把自己的武装部队从东太平洋开到了一万公里以外的西太平洋进行侵略，进行对中国人民的军事威胁！如果美国真是决不使用武力解决问题的话，那么，不是玩弄什么“停火”阴谋，而首先就该停止它的战争挑衅，把美国的一切武装力量撤出台湾和台湾海峡去。我们必须戳破美国侵略者的各式各样的画皮，迫使美国侵略者在华沙会谈中，认真地讨论美国武装部队撤出台湾和台湾海峡的具体措施。
