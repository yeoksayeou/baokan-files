    Talking About Shooting with Militia Comrades
    Guo Jingmin
    Many people participating in militia training have never held a gun before. When they receive a rifle and bullets for the first time, some may wonder: Why can a rifle send a bullet the size of a peanut flying out of the barrel in a straight line? Why can a skilled shooter accurately hit the target with a bullet?
    Every rifle has a barrel. After the bullet is pushed into the chamber, it is blocked by a large mechanism called the bolt at the breech end of the barrel, which is called "locking." After the bullet is locked by the bolt, it is held tightly on all sides, with no space for movement. The only way out is through the barrel in front of the bullet. This is the only path prescribed for the bullet.
    After firing the gun, the gunpowder in the bullet ignites first. Gunpowder has a peculiar characteristic: once ignited, it expands several thousand times. However, the bullet is enclosed in the chamber, leaving no room for it to expand. The gunpowder, filled with energy, violently propels the bullet forward. The bullet feels like being hit by a mountain weighing tens of thousands of pounds, and it is forced to separate from the cartridge case and move forward along the barrel.
    To ensure the bullet flies stably and accurately without tumbling, the rifling inside the barrel plays a role. For example, if someone throws a foot-long stick forward, the stick will wobble and may land on either end. However, if it is like a spinning top that children play with, rotating as it moves on the ground, it will not wobble. Weapon designers have used this simple principle to engrave several twisting lines in the barrel, so that when the bullet is propelled forward by the gunpowder, it rotates along the track prescribed by the lines. In this way, as long as the target is aimed at, when the bullet flies out, it will hit the enemy you want to strike in a straight line. Understanding the function of rifling, you should pay attention not to damage the rifling during training and cleaning the gun.
    All breech-loading weapons with recoil, regardless of the type of gun or cannon, have their bullets or shells fired from the barrel in this way.

    同民兵同志谈射击
    郭静民
    许多参加民兵训练的人过去从没有拿过枪，当第一次领到步枪和子弹的时候，有人也许会发生疑问：为什么步枪能叫花生米一样小的子弹头规规矩矩地飞出枪膛？为什么一个熟练的射击手能叫子弹头准确地打中在目标上？
    每一支步枪上都有一根枪管，当子弹推上膛以后，就被一种叫做枪机的大机件堵死在枪管后面的药膛部分，这叫做“闭锁”，子弹被枪机闭锁以后，卡得上、下、左、右和后边都没有一丝一分活动的空隙了，只有在子弹头的前面，可以沿着枪管出去。这是给子弹规定好的唯一的路。
    打枪以后，首先是子弹里的火药燃烧起来。火药有个怪脾气，只要一着起来，就能胀大好几千倍。但是，子弹被包围在枪膛里，没有地方容它胀，火药憋了一肚子的劲，硬把弹头顶撞出去。弹头就好像受了几万斤重的大山猛撞一下，被强迫脱离了弹壳，顺着枪膛朝前走。
    子弹要打得稳、打得准，不翻筋斗，枪膛里面刻着几条膛线，就有这个作用。比如有一个人向前扔一根一尺长的小棍，只见小棍东摇西晃的，说不定哪头先着地。可是，如果像小孩玩的螺陀一样，叫它在地上边转边走，就不会摇晃了。武器的设计者们，就是利用这样一个简单的道理，在枪膛里刻上几条缠绕的线，让子弹受火药逼赶着朝前走的时候，沿着线条所规定的跑道旋转起来。这样，只要目标瞄准，当子弹飞出去以后，就会朝前规规矩矩地击中你所要打击的敌人。明白了膛线的作用，平时在操练和擦枪的时候，就应注意不要磨坏了膛线。
    一切有后座力的后膛武器，不管是哪种枪支、大炮，它们的子弹、炮弹都是这样飞出枪膛的。
