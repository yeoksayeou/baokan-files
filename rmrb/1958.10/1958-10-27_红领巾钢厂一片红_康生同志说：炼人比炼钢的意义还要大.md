Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 25th. The twelve primary schools in the Xigong District of Luoyang City, Henan Province, have jointly established the Red Scarf Steel Plant. Comrade Kang Sheng, Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, recently visited this factory and convened a symposium of the factory's Party branch secretary, teachers, and Young Pioneers, listened to their reports, and gave them instructions after the meeting.

The Red Scarf Steel Plant has three cupola furnaces, ten ladles, fourteen small indigenous steelmaking furnaces, and two 0.5-meter converters. There are three workshops: converter steelmaking, oxygen blowing steelmaking, and indigenous steelmaking, as well as a complete production management organization for procurement, accounting, warehousing, and transportation. From September 21st to October 21st, it has produced 130 tons of steel with good product quality. Currently, the factory can produce 40 tons of steel per day. More than 4,700 teachers and students from primary schools throughout the district have participated in steel smelting. 201 teachers and students are regularly engaged in steelmaking and teaching at the factory, with most people engaged in auxiliary labor outside the factory. Among them, 117 are senior primary school graduates and fifth and sixth-grade students aged 14 to 18. They are all Young Pioneers. Four Young Pioneers serve as deputy directors of the factory, and ten Young Pioneers serve as directors and deputy directors of workshops.

In the early stages of the Red Scarf Steel Plant's construction, some teachers believed that elementary school students' participation in steelmaking would affect children's physical and mental health and hinder the improvement of teaching quality. Some said that it was impossible to teach children steelmaking techniques. Some emphasized difficulties in smelting equipment, funding, and other aspects. The school Party organization led the masses in a large-scale debate to criticize various erroneous ideas while leading schools to raise funds and equipment, start construction, and send people to visit and study at steel plants in Luoyang City and conduct trial smelting with small indigenous furnaces.

In order to allow children to learn well, work well, and stay healthy in steelmaking, the factory adopted various measures in teaching and production according to children's different ages, physiques, and interests. Students in the first, second, and third grades, aged seven to nine, worked outside the factory for two hours, participating in activities such as collecting scrap iron, digging and washing iron sand, picking up firewood, and collecting broken tile shards, shifting their interest in filling small pockets with wood and iron nails to meaningful labor. The older children who worked in the factory spent half their time studying and half their time producing. Reasonable divisions of labor were also made in the labor organization. Those aged fourteen or fifteen participated in making sand molds, batching materials, mechanical management, oxygen blowing, and other light work. The older ones carried ladles, forged, and lined furnaces, and they received the deep care and love of teachers in their labor. Initially, they slept in tents in the wild, or when they first approached the splashing sparks of molten steel, they felt scared and surprised. At this time, the teachers accompanied the students to sleep in the tents. All production and experimental processes were taken by Party members and Young Pioneer instructors who were teachers as the first step, teaching them to gradually understand the characteristics of molten steel. At the same time, in order to allow them to get the rest they deserved in their labor, the factory stipulated a holiday system, with each person resting one day a week and production time not exceeding six hours per day. The children became healthier in their rhythmic working lives, and the Young Pioneers operating near the furnace all gained weight. In order to ensure that students did not delay both production and learning, 157 teachers from the twelve primary schools in the entire Xigong District broke through the circle of division of labor by school and adopted a professional division of labor. They taught classes and prepared lessons by communicating and cooperating with each other, solving the problem of insufficient manpower after teachers participated in steelmaking and ensuring teaching time and teaching quality. In the past, the failure rate of students in some schools reached 15%, but now it is only 2%. They learned a lot of practical and theoretical knowledge in steelmaking. Many of them know the principle of using oxygen to blow molten steel for steelmaking, the chemical effect of adding aluminum, manganese, limestone, and other ingredients in steelmaking, what role the chemical components in refractory clay play, and what high, medium, and low carbon steel are, becoming the youngest generation of smelters in our country. They said that since the establishment of the factory, such workers have been passed down for four generations, that is, the "founding heroes" were the first generation. They used the method of students teaching students and have taught three batches of children how to make steel. Bai Chunxiang, a fourteen-year-old Young Pioneer and senior primary school graduate, is one of the members of the third generation. He is now the backbone of the factory's batching team and the deputy director of the oxygen blowing steelmaking workshop. He also created a simplified aluminum method to save a lot of money for the country. The ten or so people studying under him are the "fourth generation."

After teachers from these schools made steel with the students, they also received great training. Their biggest gain was that they began to put down the airs of intellectuals and understand the labor of the working class. When Teacher Fei Huazhang first went to the worker's steelmaking furnace to learn the technique, it was July, and he kindly followed the old worker to fan him. The old worker said, "No need to fan, it's not hot!" He didn't understand it at all. Now, after working near the furnace for three months, he realized the significant impact of labor on all aspects of people's lives. Once, when he saw workers stirring sewage with iron rods, he felt that the labor was just a simple action, but when he participated in this labor himself, he felt that the knowledge he had gained from reading and observing in the past was not truly learned knowledge, and only productive labor was the true source of knowledge.

The outstanding achievements of the Red Scarf Steel Plant have changed the attitudes of those who originally opposed elementary school students participating in labor. Bai Chunxiang's parents initially opposed their son's participation in steelmaking, fearing that the child would damage his health and waste his studies. However, when they saw that Bai Chunxiang had become stronger and gained a lot of scientific knowledge after working by the steelmaking furnace for three months, they all realized that steelmaking produces talent and that people who participate in steelmaking progress quickly.

On October 20th, the teachers and students of the twelve schools in the Xigong District all implemented the supply system. The steelmaking middle school with a half-work, half-study system was also announced on this day, and the twelve primary schools in the Xigong District were renamed Steelmaking Primary Schools. All teachers and students are determined to overfulfill this year's steel production target of 1,500 tons within the 70 days of the year.

After listening to the reports from the teachers and students who produced steel at the Red Scarf Steel Plant, Comrade Kang Sheng praised them, saying that these primary schools are truly model primary schools, their direction is correct, primary schools throughout the country should learn from them, and encouraged them to continue to work hard, refining both steel and people, and that refining people is more significant than refining steel. According to Comrade Kang Sheng's instructions, the Red Scarf Steel Plant is trying to improve smelting technology and product quality, requiring that teaching and productive labor be better combined, refining both steel and people, giving full play to the communist style of daring to think, act, and dare to experiment, and maintaining a thrifty style, while also paying attention to production safety. Various primary schools used the method of large-scale airing of views, large-scale blooming, and large-scale debate to further advance the production target of 1,500 tons of steel by the end of the year, which was originally planned.

    红领巾钢厂一片红
    康生同志说：炼人比炼钢的意义还要大
    新华社郑州25日电　河南省洛阳市西工区十二个小学联合建成红领巾钢铁厂。中共中央政治局候补委员康生同志最近参观了这个工厂，并且召集厂党支部书记、教员、少先队员开座谈会，听取了他们的汇报，会后向他们作了指示。
    红领巾钢铁厂有三个化铁炉，十个铁水包，十四个小型土法炼钢炉，两个零点五公尺的转炉。有转炉炼钢、吹氧炼钢、土法炼钢三个车间，以及采购、会计、保管、运输等一套完整的生产管理组织。从9月21日到10月21日，已产钢一百三十吨，产品质量良好。目前，这个工厂可日产钢四十吨。全区各小学的师生四千七百多人都参加了冶炼钢铁的工作。经常在工厂炼钢和教学的师生有二百零一人，大部分人在厂外做辅助劳动。其中有一百一十七人是十四岁到十八岁的高小毕业生和五、六年级的学生。他们都是少先队员。有四个少先队员担任副厂长，十个少先队员担任车间主任和副主任。
    红领巾钢铁厂在建厂初期，一部分教师认为，小学生参加炼钢会影响儿童的身心健康，妨碍教学质量的提高。有人说，要儿童学会炼钢技术是办不到的。有些人强调冶炼设备、资金等方面的困难。学校党组织一面领导群众大辩论，批判各种各样的错误思想，一面领导各校筹集资金、设备，开始建厂，同时派人到洛阳市各炼钢厂参观学习，用小型土炉试炼。
    为了让儿童们在炼钢铁中学习好、劳动好、身体好，工厂按照儿童不同的年龄、体格和生活兴趣，在教学和生产中采取了各种措施。从七岁到九岁的一、二、三年级学生在厂外劳动两小时，参加拾废铁、挖淘铁砂、拣木柴、拾缸瓦片等劳动，把他们欢喜在衣服小口袋里装木头、铁钉的兴趣转移到有意义的劳动方面来。在厂内劳动的大孩子们，都是半天学习，半天生产，在劳动组织上也作了合理的分工，十四、五岁的参加做砂型、配料、机械管理、吹氧一类轻便的活。年纪更大一些的就抬铁水包、锻造、搪炉子等，他们在劳动中得到老师们深切关怀与爱护。当初，他们睡在野地上的帐篷里，或是初次接近飞溅着火花的钢水，心里又害怕又惊奇，这时，老师们就陪着学生睡在帐篷里，一切生产试验过程都由教师中的党员和少先队辅导员先行一步，教他们逐步了解钢水性格，同时，为了让他们在劳动中获得应有的休息，厂里规定了休假制度，每人每星期休息一天，生产时间每天至多不超过六小时。孩子们在有节奏的劳动生活中身体更加健康起来，在炉边操作的少先队员，人人都增加了体重。为了保证学生们生产、学习两不误，全西工区十二个小学的一百五十七位教员突破了按学校分工的圈子，采取按专业分工。互通有无、彼此协作的办法，进行备课授课，解决了教师参加炼钢后人力不足的困难，保证了教学时间和教学质量。过去，有的学校学生考试成绩不及格的达到15％，现在只有2％。他们在炼钢中学到很多实际知识和理论知识。他们中很多人都知道用铁水吹氧炼钢的道理，在炼钢中加铝、锰、石灰石等配料的化学作用是什么，耐火土中的化学成分起些什么作用，以及什么叫高、中、低炭钢等，成为我国最年轻一代的冶炼工人了。他们说，建厂以来，这样的工人已经传了四代，即
  “开厂元勋”是第一代，他们用学生教学生的办法，已经教会了三批少年儿童学会了炼钢。十四岁的少先队员、高小毕业生白春祥是第三代的成员之一，他现在是厂里配料组的骨干，吹氧炼钢车间的副主任，还创造了简易化铝法为国家节约了大量资金，在他的手下学习的十来个人就是第“四代”。
    这些学校的教师们和学生在一起炼钢后，也受到很大的锻炼。他们最大的收获是开始放下知识分子的架子，了解了工人阶级的劳动。斐华璋老师初到工人炼钢炉旁学技术时，是7月天气，他好心地跟在老工人背后扇扇，老工人说：“不用扇，不算热！”他听了很不理解。现在，他在炉旁劳动了三个月，才体会到劳动对人们各方面生活锻炼的重大影响。有一次，他看到工人用铁棍搅污水时，觉得劳动只是简单的动作，但是当他自己参加这项劳动后，才感到过去从读书和旁观中得到的知识，并不是真正学会了知识，只有生产劳动，才是真正知识的源泉。
    红领巾炼钢铁的出色成就，使原来反对小学生参加劳动的人，也改变了态度。白春祥的父母起先反对儿子参加炼钢，深怕孩子弄坏了身体，荒废了学业。但是，当他们见到白春祥在炼钢炉边工作了三个月后，身体长得更加结实，又有了不少的科学知识时，他们都认识到炼钢出人材，参加炼钢人的进步快。
    西工区十二个学校的师生已经在10月20日全部实行了供给制。半工半读的钢铁中学也在这天宣告成立，西工区十二个小学都改名为钢铁小学。全体师生，决心在年内的七十天内，超额完成今年产钢一千五百吨的任务。
    康生同志在听取了红领巾钢铁厂生产的师生们汇报后赞扬说，这几个小学真正是模范小学，他们的方向对头，全国各地小学都要向他们学习，并勉励他们继续努力，既炼钢又炼人，炼人比炼钢的意义还要大。根据康生同志的指示，红领巾钢铁厂正在设法提高冶炼技术和产品质量；要求把教学和生产劳动更好地结合起来，既炼好钢又炼好人，既要发挥敢想敢作敢为、大胆试验的共产主义风格，和保持勤俭的作风，同时还要注意生产安全。各个小学用大鸣大放大辩论的办法，把原计划到年底产钢一千五百吨的生产指标再向前跃进一步。（附图片）
