    On "Everyone for me, I for everyone"

    Many readers have written to ask whether the phrases "I for everyone, everyone for me" and "Everyone for me, I for everyone" (for example, the title of the People's Daily editorial on March 15 was like this), which are often seen in newspapers, have the same meaning. Some readers believe that the phrase "Everyone for me, I for everyone" is incorrect because it puts "me" first, first requiring everyone to be for "me," and then "I" am for everyone.

    We believe that these two phrases have the same meaning. They both represent the relationship between the individual and the collective and embody collectivist thought. And "Everyone for me, I for everyone" is a common idiom. Lenin wrote in "From the First Moscow-Kazan Railway Saturday Voluntary Labor to the All-Russia May Day Saturday Voluntary Labor": "We must strive to eliminate the cursed rule of 'Everyone for himself, God for us all,' and overcome the habit of thinking that labor is only a burden and that all labor should be paid a certain reward. We must strive to instill the principles of 'Everyone for me, I for everyone' (also translated as 'Everyone for one, one for everyone') and 'From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs' into the minds of the masses, make them their habits, make them their life routines, we must gradually and unremittingly implement communist discipline and promote communist labor." It can be seen that the communist slogans "Everyone for me, I for everyone" and "From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs" can be linked together.

    "Everyone for me, I for everyone" means that everyone is working for me, and I am also working for everyone. It cannot be interpreted as: first everyone works for me, and then I can work for everyone. It is also acceptable to think "I for everyone, everyone for me."

### 关于“人人为我，我为人人”

    关于“人人为我，我为人人”
    不少读者来信问，在报上常常看到“我为人人，人人为我”的提法，有时也看到“人人为我，我为人人”的提法（例如人民日报3月15日的社论标题就是这样），这两种提法是不是一样的？有的读者认为“人人为我，我为人人”的提法是错误的，因为它把“我”摆在第一位，首先要求人人为“我”，而后“我”才为人人。
    我们认为这两种提法的含意是一样的，它们都是表示个人和集体的关系，都是体现集体主义思想的。而“人人为我，我为人人”，则是一句通用的成语。列宁在“从莫斯科—喀山铁路的第一次星期六义务劳动到五一节全俄星期六义务劳动”一文中写道：“我们要努力消灭‘人人为自己，上帝为大家’这个可诅咒的常规，克服那种认为劳动只是一种负担，而凡是劳动都应当付给一定报酬的习惯。我们要努力把‘人人为我，我为人人’（亦译“大家为一人，一人为大家”）和‘各尽所能，各取所需’的原则灌输到群众的思想中去，变成他们的习惯，变为他们的生活常规，我们要逐步地坚持不懈地实行共产主义纪律，推行共产主义劳动。”可见“人人为我，我为人人”和“各尽所能，各取所需”的共产主义口号可以联系在一起。
  “人人为我，我为人人”的意思，是人人都在为我工作，我也在为人人工作。不能把它解释为：首先是人人都为我工作，而后我才能为人人工作。如果认为“我为人人，人人为我”亦无不可。
