    The following is a report from this newspaper's Yangquan correspondent:
    A major revolutionary change—adjusting employee housing based on production units as the center—has been implemented in major factories and mines in Yangquan City, Shanxi Province. On the basis of this change, the Yangquan Mining Area People's Commune was declared established on National Day.
    Since liberation, factories and mines in Yangquan City have built a large number of spacious and comfortable employee dormitories, in addition to repairing and utilizing existing vacant houses. However, due to the fact that the unreasonable layout of the old city's housing has not yet been reformed, and the newly built houses have not been uniformly arranged with the production unit as the center, most of them were built and moved into by employees who urgently needed housing, resulting in serious dispersion and confusion in employee housing. Workers from various pits and workshops lived in a mixed and scattered manner, with some dormitories being as far as ten *li* away from the working face. Workers from the same workshop and even the same group lived dozens of *li* apart. A collective dormitory housing dozens of people often housed workers from different workshops, different types of work, and different shifts. Some had just fallen asleep, while others were about to get up for work, interfering with each other and affecting production. Because there was not enough time and a suitable location to carry out the Party's political and ideological work, and workers lacked a certain organizational and disciplinary guarantee and restraint, many people gradually became infected with bourgeois ideas, and particularly serious was that it created opportunities for sabotage by bad elements.
    During the "burning the leadership" stage of the rectification movement last December, workers raised many opinions regarding the above-mentioned problems. After careful research, each factory and mine found that the focus of many contradictions lay in the dispersion and confusion of housing. At that time, the Yangquan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued the "Five Togethers" (eat together, live together, labor together, study together, and entertain together) instruction, which inspired the factories and mines to successively make the decision to "divide dormitory areas according to pits and workshops and concentrate housing for workers and cadres of the same production unit." According to this decision, in the dormitory area of each pit and workshop, collective dormitory areas and residential areas for workers with families were also divided. The collective dormitories were arranged for groups of workers of the same type of work and the same shift, and family dormitories were also arranged in zones according to production teams and groups. This major change in housing first began in the Fourth and Third Mines, and then spread to the First and Second Mines, the Yangquan Iron Plant, and the Chemical Plant. The broad masses of employees and their families in each factory and mine expressed their welcome to this revolutionary measure, but a few people worried that the newly moved houses were not good, and that it would be inconvenient for their children to attend school, buy grain, buy vegetables, and watch operas, or that they were unwilling to live apart from acquaintances, fellow villagers, friends, and old neighbors. Therefore, each factory and mine mobilized the masses to speak out, debate, and make everyone deeply aware of the benefits of adjusting the dormitories. Then, Party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and cadres were mobilized to take the lead in moving, and to accept the reasonable demands of the masses. In some urgently needed dormitory areas, grain retail departments, department stores, vegetable supply stations, health care stations, primary schools for employees' children, and public canteens were immediately established. In this way, in less than a few days, tens of thousands of employees and their families, except for some who built their own houses and those living in nearby villages who had not yet been adjusted, moved into their new homes according to the new plan. Immediately afterwards, the Party, Trade Union, and Communist Youth League organizations of each mine, factory, and workshop also moved their offices to the dormitory areas. Under the unified leadership of the Party organizations of each pit and workshop, management committees, family committees, and mediation committees were established in each dormitory area, and cadres were assigned to be responsible for hygiene, household registration, and public security work, scientifically dividing the work in the dormitory area.
    After adjusting the dormitories and concentrating housing, the production outlook of the factories and mines in Yangquan City and the spiritual outlook and living conditions of all employees and their families have undergone unprecedented and enormous changes. At present, each factory and mine has formed several mighty labor armies that are both workers and students and soldiers, in accordance with the spirit of "organizational militarization, action combatization, and life collectivization." The battalions, companies, platoons, and squads of these labor armies are organized according to dormitory areas, types of work, shifts, and collective dormitories. Therefore, they are fully capable of uniformly arranging combat (production) tasks, military training, political and cultural studies, recreational and sports activities, as well as the time for eating, sleeping, and getting up. The attendance rate of each factory and mine has generally increased from about 80% last year to over 95%, and absenteeism, personal leave, and sick leave have been greatly reduced. The Party's political and ideological work has been universally strengthened. Leading cadres at all levels work and live with the workers, and everyone appears as a worker, greatly strengthening the relationship between the Party and the masses. The experience of speaking out, debating, and the "three schools, three days, one department, and two rooms" in political and ideological work has been widely promoted in the dormitory areas, and the righteousness of communism has greatly risen. More than 2,000 employees' family members have participated in production, and the rest have also ensured that they do a good job of household labor, encouraging their loved ones to make great leaps forward and launch "satellites." More than 40 various factories established by employees and their families have been put into production. Illegal acts such as fighting and brawling have basically disappeared.
    At the active request of the broad masses, the Yangquan Mining Area People's Commune has been officially established. This commune has a total population of 150,000, including 23 factories and mines, 75 villages, 2 streets, 2 universities, 6 middle schools, 22 primary schools, and a number of shops, hospitals, and other units. It has important significance for transforming the mining area, eliminating the differences between urban and rural areas, between workers and peasants, and between mental and physical labor.

### 领导干部同工人住在一起，党、工、团搬到宿舍区办公  把工人生产组织起来，也把工人的社会生活组织起来

    领导干部同工人住在一起，党、工、团搬到宿舍区办公
    把工人生产组织起来，也把工人的社会生活组织起来
    本报阳泉讯　一个具有重大革命意义的变革——按照生产单位为中心调整职工住宿，已在山西阳泉市各大厂矿实现。在这个变革的基础之上，阳泉矿区人民公社已于国庆节宣告成立。
    阳泉市各个厂矿在解放以来，除了修理和利用原有的闲散房屋以外，还大批地新建了宽敞舒适的职工宿舍。但是，由于对旧城市房屋布局的不合理现象还未来得及改革，对新建房屋又没有按照生产单位为中心加以统一安排，多是边建边由迫切需要房屋的职工迁入，形成了职工住宿上的严重分散和混乱现象。各个坑口、各个车间的工人居住掺杂交错，东零西散，有的宿舍距离工作面达十华里之远，同一车间、同一小组工人的居住甚至有相距数十里以上的。一个数十人的集体工房，往往住着不同车间、不同工种、不同班次的工人，有的刚刚睡下，有的就要起床上班，互相干扰，影响生产。由于没有更多的时间和阵地去进行党的政治思想工作，工人中又缺乏一定组织、纪律的保证和约束，有不少人便逐渐染上了资产阶级思想，特别严重的是给坏分子的破坏活动造成了可乘之机。
    在去年12月整风运动进入“火烧领导”阶段的时候，工人们针对上述问题，提出不少意见，各厂矿经过认真研究，发现很多矛盾的焦点在于住宿的分散和混乱。当时，中共阳泉市委又下达了“五同”（同吃、同住、同劳动、同学习、同娱乐）的指示，这就启示各厂矿先后作出了“按照坑口、车间划分宿舍区和同一生产单位工人、干部集中住宿”的决定。依照这个决定，在每个坑口和车间的宿舍区里，又划分了集体工房区和带家属工人住宅区，集体工房是在同工种、同班次的前提下分组住宿，家属宿舍也按照生产上的队、组分片安排。这个住宿上的重大变革，首先开始于四矿和三矿，然后发展到一矿、二矿、阳泉铁厂和化工厂。各厂矿广大职工及其家属对这一革命措施纷纷表示欢迎，但也有少数人顾虑新迁居的房子不好，子女上学、买粮、买菜、看戏不方便，或者不愿同熟人、同乡、朋友、老邻居分住两地。因此，各厂矿都发动群众鸣放辩论，使大家深刻认识了调整宿舍的好处，然后发动党员、团员、干部带头搬家，并接受群众的合理要求，在某些迫切需要的宿舍区里，立即设立了粮食门市部、百货商店、蔬菜供应站、卫生保健站、职工子弟小学和公共食堂。这样不到几天，除一些自建房屋和临村居住者尚未调整外，数万名职工及其家属均按照新的规划迁入新居。紧接着，各个矿厂和车间的党、工、团组织，也将自己的办公室搬到了宿舍区里。在各坑口、车间党组织的统一领导下，各个宿舍区又建立了管理委员会、家属委员会和调处委员会，配备了专管卫生、户籍、治安工作的干部，把宿舍区的各项工作都科学地分管起来。
    经过调整宿舍集中住宿后，已使阳泉市各厂矿的生产面貌和所有职工及其家属的精神面貌、生活面貌，起了空前的、巨大的变化。目前各个厂矿已根据“组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化”的精神，组成了几支千军万马的亦工亦学亦兵的劳动大军。这些劳动大军的营、连、排、班，都是按照宿舍区及工种、班次和集体工房来编制的，因此，完全有条件统一安排战斗（生产）任务、军事训练、政治文化学习、文娱体育活动以及吃饭、睡觉、起床的时间。各厂矿的出勤率，已普遍由去年的80％左右上升到95％以上，旷工、事假、病假大大减少。党的政治思想工作已普遍加强，各级领导干部同工人一起劳动，一起住宿，人人以劳动者姿态出现，大大密切了党与群众的关系。鸣放辩论和“三校、三日、一部、二室”政治思想工作经验已在宿舍区普遍推广，共产主义的正气大大上升。职工家属有两千余人参加生产，其余的人也都保证做好家务劳动，鼓励自己的亲人大跃进、放“卫星”。职工和家属创办的各种工厂已有四十多个投入生产。打架、斗殴等不法行为已基本绝迹。
    在广大群众的积极要求下，阳泉矿区人民公社已正式诞生。这个公社共有十五万人口，它包括有二十三个厂矿、七十五个农村、两个街道、两座大学、六座中学、二十二座小学以及若干商店、医院等单位。它对改造矿区，消灭城乡之间、工农之间、脑力劳动与体力劳动之间的差别，有着重要的意义。
