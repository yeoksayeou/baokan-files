    The Socialist Camp is United as One
    Peng Zhen's Speech at the Inaugural Meeting of Ten Friendship Associations

    Xinhua News Agency, 30th—Comrade Peng Zhen's speech at the inaugural meeting of the China-Albania, China-Bulgaria, China-Hungary, China-Vietnam, China-Germany, China-Korea, China-Mongolia, China-Poland, China-Romania, and China-Czechoslovakia Friendship Associations. The full text is as follows: Dear guests, comrades, and friends:

    Today, on the eve of the ninth anniversary of our country's founding, we are solemnly holding the inaugural meeting of the Friendship Associations of the People's Republic of China and the People's Republic of Albania, the People's Republic of Bulgaria, the People's Republic of Hungary, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the German Democratic Republic, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Mongolian People's Republic, the People's Republic of Poland, the Romanian People's Republic, and the Czechoslovak Republic. First of all, on behalf of the Chinese people, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations on the establishment of the friendship associations between our country and these ten socialist brother countries! At the same time, please allow me to take this opportunity to extend a warm welcome to the distinguished guests attending our country's ninth anniversary celebration, and through them, to extend our highest respect to the people of all countries in the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union!

    The establishment of these ten friendship associations marks a new development in the friendly unity and mutual assistance and cooperation between the Chinese people and the people of various brother countries. Since achieving revolutionary victory, the Chinese people, like the people of all brother countries, have cherished the friendly unity and mutual assistance and cooperation among the people of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union. The Party and the government have always paid the greatest attention to conducting internationalist education on the unity and mutual assistance of socialist countries among the masses. Even before the founding of the People's Republic of China, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in his article “On the People's Democratic Dictatorship”: “Internationally, our country belongs to the anti-imperialist front headed by the Soviet Union. Genuine friendly assistance can only be sought from this side, and not from the imperialist side.” In his speech “On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People,” Comrade Mao Zedong clearly instructed us: “Consolidating unity with the Soviet Union and consolidating unity with all socialist countries is our basic policy and where our fundamental interests lie.” At the beginning of the founding of our country in 1949, the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association was established. The friendly relations between our country and the people of other brother countries have also undergone satisfactory and comprehensive development with the development of friendly cooperation in various aspects such as politics, economy, science and technology, and culture, and mutual visits between governments and people. This friendly cooperative relationship has penetrated into all areas of our people's lives and has become an indispensable part of our people's lives. Like the people of all brother countries, the Chinese people have increasingly deeply realized the great political significance of the friendly unity and mutual support of the people of socialist countries from the practice of building socialism and striving for world peace and human progress. Establishing our country's friendship associations with various brother countries can consolidate and improve this understanding organizationally, and further promote the existing friendly unity and mutual assistance and cooperation relationship to a broader and deeper level.

    The relationship between our socialist countries is an entirely new type of relationship. This relationship is one of complete equality, mutual benefit, and comradely mutual assistance. The emergence of this new type of relationship is, as pointed out in the Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries: "Socialist countries are united in a unified family because they have embarked on a common socialist road, because their socio-economic system and state power have a common class essence, because they need to support and assist each other, because they have common interests and goals in the struggle against imperialism and for the victory of socialism and communism, and because they have a common Marxist-Leninist ideology.” This brand-new relationship cannot be formed or conceived among capitalist countries.

    The unity of our socialist countries is beneficial to all peace-loving countries and people, and beneficial to the national independence struggles of all countries. It is only detrimental to the belligerent imperialist groups headed by US imperialism. This is precisely why imperialism and modern revisionists try their best to undermine the unity of socialist countries.

    Today, the great socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is more united and stronger than ever before. The great doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, the lofty ideal of building socialism and communism, and the firm will to defend world peace unite the people of all countries in the socialist camp like one person. At present, in all socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, a great leap forward has emerged in all aspects of socialist construction. Our entire camp is experiencing a great era where one day equals twenty years. The realization of the communist society that mankind has dreamed of for many years, and for which countless advanced and outstanding people have struggled hard, shed blood, and sacrificed, is no longer a distant future in the countries of the socialist camp, which account for one-third of the world's population and one-quarter of the world's area.

    However, just as owls do not like daylight, our beautiful cause is also hated by some people. These people are the ruling groups of the imperialist camp headed by US imperialism and their lackeys. But, unfortunately, their hatred for our cause cannot improve their inevitable fate of failure in the slightest. On the contrary, the imperialist camp is undergoing an increasingly acute crisis, and is increasingly disintegrating internally due to numerous contradictions. The US imperialists, the head of the imperialist aggression group, are now expanding aggression everywhere, establishing military bases, and antagonizing the Chinese and other socialist countries' people, the Arab people, and peace-loving people all over the world, thinking that this can save themselves from their doom. But they are completely wrong. As Comrade Mao Zedong said not long ago, they are making a noose themselves and putting it around their own necks. Their persistent pursuit of the policy of aggression and the policy of war can only accelerate their own death. Victory will surely belong to the people who love peace, progress, and fight for the cause of peace and progress.

    Recently, US imperialism has not only been creating new conspiracies in the Middle East, but also, regardless of the Chinese people's repeated warnings, and the strong condemnation of the socialist countries' people, the people of Asian, African, Latin American countries, and other countries, continues to occupy our country's territory of Taiwan, and conducts serious military provocations in our inland sea islands,妄想用战争威胁吓倒中国人民. The Chinese people love peace, but the Chinese people have never been afraid of war. We must liberate Jinmen and Mazu, and we must liberate Taiwan. This is the unwavering will of the Chinese people. No war threat can scare the Chinese people, and no conspiracy can deceive the Chinese people. If US imperialism insists on imposing war on the Chinese people, the Chinese people will surely give a head-on blow. The Chinese people have not failed to compete with the aggressive forces of US imperialism. If US imperialism is not crazy and forgetful, it should receive and remember a little lesson.

    Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people are engaging in our country's socialist construction with soaring enthusiasm, quickly, well, and economically; at the same time, they are also carrying out a just struggle against the military provocations and war threats of US imperialism with unparalleled anger and firm fighting spirit. All the construction achievements and victory of our people are inseparable from the support given to us by the people of socialist countries. Here, I would like to express my brotherly gratitude to the people of all socialist countries.

    Comrades, friends, on the eve of this great festival of the Chinese people, please allow me to once again represent the Chinese people in extending our highest respects to the people of all brother countries, and wish them new and more brilliant achievements in the great cause of socialist construction.

    May the friendship between the people of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union last forever!

    社会主义阵营团结得像一个人
    彭真同志在十个友协成立大会上讲话全文
    新华社30日讯　彭真同志在中阿、中保、中匈、中越、中德、中朝、中蒙、中波、中罗、中捷友好协会成立大会上的讲话。全文如下：亲爱的贵宾们、同志们、朋友们：
    今天，在我国建国九周年的前夕，我们在这里隆重举行中华人民共和国和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国、保加利亚人民共和国、匈牙利人民共和国、越南民主共和国、德意志民主共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、蒙古人民共和国、波兰人民共和国、罗马尼亚人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克共和国十个友好协会的成立大会。首先，我代表中国人民对我国同这十个社会主义兄弟国家的友好协会的成立表示衷心的祝贺！同时，请允许我借此机会向到会的参加我国九周年国庆典礼的贵宾们表示热烈的欢迎，并且通过他们向以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的人民，致以崇高的敬意！
    这十个友好协会的成立，标志着中国人民同各兄弟国家人民的友好团结和互助合作关系的一个新发展。中国人民自从取得革命胜利以来，同所有的兄弟国家人民一样，十分珍视以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国人民之间的友好团结和互助合作，党和政府经常以最大的注意力，在人民群众中进行社会主义国家团结互助的国际主义教育。还在中华人民共和国成立之前，毛泽东同志就在“论人民民主专政”的文章里指出：“我国在国际上是属于以苏联为首的反帝国主义战线一方面的，真正的友谊的援助只能向这一方面去找，而不能向帝国主义方面去找。”毛泽东同志在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演中明确地指示我们：“巩固同苏联的团结，巩固同一切社会主义国家的团结，这是我们的基本方针，基本利益所在。”我国在1949年建国之始，就成立了中苏友好协会。我国同其他兄弟国家人民之间的友好关系，也随着政治、经济、科学技术、文化等各方面的友好合作关系的发展，和政府之间、人民之间的相互访问，有了令人满意的全面的发展。这种友好合作关系已经深入到我们各国人民生活的各个领域，成为我们各国人民生活的不可缺少的一部分。中国人民同各兄弟国家人民一样，从建设社会主义、争取世界和平和人类进步事业的实践中，日益深刻地认识到社会主义各国人民友好团结和相互支持的重大政治意义。建立我国对各个兄弟国家的友好协会，可以从组织上巩固和提高这种认识，并且将已有的友好团结和互助合作关系进一步推向更加广泛，更加深入。
    我们社会主义国家之间的关系，完全是新型的关系。这种关系是完全平等、互利和同志般互助的关系。这种新型关系的产生，正像社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言中所指出的：“社会主义国家团结在统一的大家庭里，是由于它们走上了共同的社会主义道路，由于它们的社会经济制度和国家政权有共同的阶级实质，由于它们需要互相支持和援助，由于它们在反对帝国主义、争取社会主义和共产主义胜利的斗争中有共同的利益和目的，由于它们有共同的马克思列宁主义思想。”这种崭新的关系，在资本主义国家之间，是不可能形成的，也是不能设想的。
    我们社会主义国家的团结，是有利于一切爱好和平的国家和人民，有利于各国的民族独立斗争的，它只是不利于以美国帝国主义为首的好战的帝国主义集团。这正是为什么帝国主义和现代修正主义分子要千方百计破坏社会主义国家团结的原因所在。
    今天，以苏联为首的伟大的社会主义阵营，比任何时候都更加团结、更加壮大了。马克思列宁主义的伟大学说，建设社会主义和共产主义的崇高理想，保卫世界和平的坚定意志，把社会主义阵营各国人民团结得像一个人一样。目前，在以苏联为首的社会主义各国里，社会主义建设的各个方面，出现了大跃进的局面。我们整个阵营都在经历着一天等于二十年的伟大时代。实现人类多少年来所梦想的，无数先进的优秀人物为之艰苦奋斗、流血牺牲的共产主义社会，在人口占世界三分之一、面积占世界四分之一的社会主义阵营的各国里，已经不是遥远未来的事情了。
    但是，正如猫头鹰不喜欢白昼一样，我们的美好事业也为一些人所仇视。这些人，就是以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义阵营的统治集团和它的走狗们。但是，可惜得很，他们对我们事业的仇视，并不能使他们的必然失败的命运丝毫有所改善。恰恰相反，帝国主义阵营正在经历着一场日益加剧的危机，内部正在因为矛盾重重而日益分崩离析。帝国主义侵略集团的头子美国帝国主义者，现在到处扩大侵略，建立军事基地，同中国和其他社会主义各国人民、阿拉伯人民和全世界爱好和平的人民为敌，以为这样可以挽救自己灭亡的命运。但是，他们完全想错了。正如毛泽东同志不久前说过的，他们这是自己制造绞索，并把它套在自己的脖子上。他们坚持推行的侵略政策和战争政策，只能加速他们自己的死亡。胜利一定属于爱好和平、进步并且为和平、进步事业斗争的人民。
    最近，美帝国主义不仅还在中近东制造新的阴谋，并且不顾中国人民的多次警告，和社会主义各国人民、亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国和其他各国人民的严厉谴责，继续侵占我国领土台湾，在我国内海岛屿进行严重的军事挑衅，妄想用战争威胁吓倒中国人民。中国人民是爱好和平的，但是中国人民从来不害怕战争。我们一定要解放金门、马祖，一定要解放台湾，这是中国人民坚定不移的意志。任何战争威胁吓不倒中国人民，任何阴谋诡计骗不了中国人民。如果美帝国主义硬要把战争强加在中国人民头上，中国人民必将给予迎头痛击。中国人民同美帝国主义侵略势力不是没有较量过的，美帝国主义者如果不是发疯、健忘的话，就应该得到和记得一点教训。
    中国人民在中国共产党的正确领导下，正在以冲天的干劲，多快好省地从事我国的社会主义建设；同时，也正以无比的愤怒和坚定的斗志，同美帝国主义的军事挑衅和战争威胁进行着正义的斗争。我国人民所有的建设成就和斗争胜利，是和社会主义各国人民所给予我们的支持分不开的。在这里，谨向社会主义各国人民致以兄弟般的感谢。
    同志们，朋友们，在这中国人民的伟大节日的前夕，请允许我再一次代表中国人民向各兄弟国家人民致以崇高的敬礼，并且祝他们在伟大的社会主义建设事业中取得新的更加辉煌的成就。
    以苏联为首的社会主义各国人民之间的友谊万古长青！
