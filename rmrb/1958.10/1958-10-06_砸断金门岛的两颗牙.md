　　The Chiang bandit troops on the small islands of Dadan and Erdan, which are full of crimes, have received the severe punishment they deserve under the continuous attack of our powerful artillery forces for more than a month.
　　These two small, uninhabited islands, with a total area of ​​less than two square kilometers, became nests for the remaining Chiang bandit troops when the entire province of Fujian was liberated, along with Dajinmen and Xiaojinmen Islands. Like two teeth of Dajinmen and Xiaojinmen Islands, Chiang bandit troops often indiscriminately shelled merchant ships and fishing boats entering and leaving Xiamen Port from here, and occasionally sailed out to sea to intercept fishermen. These two islands are also a pair of evil eyes of the Chiang bandit troops. Its observation posts search for shooting targets for the long-range artillery of the Jinmen Chiang troops day and night. The Jinmen Chiang troops' many crimes of shelling Xiamen University were jointly created by them.
　　The broad masses of people in the Xiamen area extremely hate the Chiang bandit troops entrenched in Dadan and Erdan. The People's Liberation Army coastal defense artillery troops guarding this area have often used fierce artillery fire to suppress the Chiang army's artillery positions, rescue fishing boats and merchant ships that have been shelled by the Chiang army from danger, and send military doctors to treat the wounded fishermen and boat people. On August 23, when the combat order to severely punish the Chiang bandit troops was issued, the coastal defense artillery, while severely attacking the Chiang bandit troops on Dajinmen and Xiaojinmen Islands, was determined to smash the two teeth of Dadan and Erdan.
　　On the eve of National Day, when the reporter came to the command post of a certain artillery unit in the Xiamen area, the Jinmen Chiang bandit troops were fiercely shelling nearby peaceful villages. From the observation post, it could be seen that thick smoke was rising in the fields, beside the ditches, and on the roads, and a civilian house was hit by a shell and caught fire. The commander of this artillery unit said that these shells flying from Dajinmen and Xiaojinmen Islands were directed by the observation posts of the Chiang army in Dadan and Erdan. Then, at the commander's command, the two small islands suddenly rolled up a whirlwind of artillery fire. For more than a month, such artillery battles have continued every day. After the heavy blows of the coastal defense artillery, even if the Chiang bandit army observation posts in Dadan and Erdan are still doing evil, this pair of teeth has been completely paralyzed.
　　The reporter looked at Dadan and Erdan through the artillery mirror of the observation post. He saw that the dense fortifications on the two islands were smashed to pieces by artillery fire, and some were completely overturned. The Chiang bandit army artillery on the island, which had committed countless crimes, had long been silenced, and the broadcasting station originally set up on Dadan Island, which howled all day long, had also been destroyed long ago. A highway transporting military supplies was broken into several sections, lying across the hillside of Dadan like a dead snake. On the left side of the top of Dadan, there is half a section of iron flagpole remaining. The other half of it, which was cut off by artillery shells, along with the "Blue Sky White Sun" flag, was swallowed by the rolling sea long ago.
　　The people in the Xiamen area, who had suffered from the Chiang army's scourge, warmly cheered the victory of our army's powerful artillery force in severely punishing the Chiang bandit troops. They are convinced that these two teeth will eventually be completely smashed, and these two eyes will eventually be completely blinded.

    砸断金门岛的两颗牙
    新华社前线记者
    罪行累累的大担、二担两个小岛上的蒋贼军，一个多月来在我强大炮兵部队的连续打击下，受到了应得的严厉惩罚。
    这两个总面积不到两平方公里的荒无人烟的小岛，在福建全省解放时，就和大小金门岛一起成为残余蒋贼军的巢穴。它们像大小金门岛的两颗牙，从这里，蒋贼军经常对进出厦门港的商船和渔船滥施炮击，还不时驾船出海拦劫渔民。这两个岛同时也是蒋贼军的一对恶眼，它的观察所日夜为金门蒋军的远射程大炮搜索射击目标，金门蒋军多次炮击厦门大学的罪行，就是它们参与制造的。
    厦门地区的广大人民极度痛恨盘踞大担、二担的蒋贼军。守卫在这个地区的人民解放军海防炮兵部队，过去经常用猛烈炮火压制蒋军炮兵阵地，援救遭受蒋军炮击的渔船和商船脱离险境，并派出军医救治负伤的渔民和船民。8月23日，当严惩蒋贼军的作战命令下达以后，海防炮兵在痛击大小金门岛上蒋贼军的同时，决心砸断大担和二担这两颗牙。
    国庆节前夕，当记者来到厦门地区的某炮兵部队指挥所时，正值金门蒋贼军在猛烈炮击附近的和平村庄。从观察所里可以看到，田野里、水渠旁和大路上冒起一团团浓烟，有一所民房被炮弹击中起了火。这支炮兵部队的指挥员说，这些从大小金门岛上飞来的炮弹，是由大担、二担的蒋军观察所指点射击目标的。接着，指挥员一声口令，这两个小岛顿时卷起了一阵炮火的旋风。一个多月来，像这样的炮战每天都在继续。经过海防炮兵们的沉重打击，纵然大担和二担的蒋贼军观察所还在凶残地作恶，可是这一对牙早已完全瘫痪了。
    记者从观察所的炮对镜里了望大担和二担，只见这两个岛上密密麻麻的工事被炮火砸得稀烂，有的被整个掀掉了。曾经制造过无数罪行的岛上蒋贼军炮兵早被打哑，原先设在大担岛上成天嚎叫的广播站也早被摧毁。一条运送军用物资的公路断成了几截，像死蛇似的横落在大担的山腰。在大担的顶峰左侧，残留着小半截铁制的旗杆，它那被炮弹削去的另外大半截同“青天白日”旗一起，早被滚滚的大海吞噬了。
    曾经身受蒋军荼毒的厦门地区人民，热烈欢呼我军强大的炮兵部队严惩蒋贼军的胜利。他们确信这两颗牙终将被完全砸断，这两只眼也终将被完全打瞎。
