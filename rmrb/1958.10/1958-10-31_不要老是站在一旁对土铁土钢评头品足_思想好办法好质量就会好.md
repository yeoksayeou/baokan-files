Sichuan Uses Native Iron Smelted into Native Steel to Roll Good Steel Products and Manufacture Foreign Machines

(Our Dispatch from Chongqing, October 30th) The native iron produced by native blast furnaces in Sichuan is being used very well at the Chongqing Iron and Steel Plant. The steel smelted from it has already been rolled into various types of steel products and steel plates in batches, and the quality fully meets national requirements. Since October, the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company has used native iron produced in more than forty counties in the special districts of Leshan, Neijiang, Jiangjin, Daxian, Mianyang, Ya'an, Yibin, Luzhou, and others in Sichuan to smelt different types of steel such as rimmed steel and killed steel. This native iron does not contain ash, slag, or embedded sand; the iron content is similar to that of pig iron produced by large factories' foreign blast furnaces, generally above 92%. This native iron is cast into iron bars one to two feet long and three to four inches wide, with moderate size and certain specifications. After inspection and appraisal, it has been proven that this native iron is generally white cast iron and gray cast iron, and some of it can also be used by machinery processing plants for casting. Compared with the pig iron produced by Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's foreign blast furnaces, the main shortcomings are higher sulfur and phosphorus content and slightly lower silicon and manganese content, but the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company has solved this problem by adopting two methods: desulfurization in the cupola furnace and rapid desulfurization in the open-hearth furnace.

The quality of Sichuan's native iron is so good because the relevant provincial party and government leading departments have strictly controlled the quality and specifications while vigorously grasping iron production. At the same time, many prefectural and county party committees have earnestly grasped the leadership of pig iron production, universally carried out rectification at the furnace front, strengthened political and ideological education for new workers, and established responsibility and management systems such as "fixed quality, fixed quantity," "contract work, contract production, contract quality," and "check quality, check operating procedures." They have launched a competition to compare "more, faster, and better iron production." Many special districts and counties have also universally established technical guidance stations and production supervision posts and command posts to urge a large number of new workers to strictly implement operating procedures. This has promoted further improvement in the quality of native iron.

(Our Dispatch from Chongqing, October 30th) Chongqing City has used steel smelted by native methods to make complete sets of machines and parts for precision machines, opening up a broad source of materials for the machinery manufacturing industry.

The output of native steel in Chongqing is rising daily. According to statistics from October 17th to 23rd, the average daily output of steel smelted by native furnaces and native converters in the city reached more than 1,800 tons, and on the 23rd, it rose to more than 6,200 tons, exceeding the output of foreign steel on the same day by more than double. However, some conservatives and skeptics still criticize and find fault, saying that the steel smelted by these native methods is "of poor quality and of little use." Now, many units in Chongqing have made appraisals of native steel, proving that this native steel can not only make native machines but also make foreign machines. The Chongqing No. 1 Mechanical Manufacturing Industrial School first forged steel from the school's chicken coop furnace (i.e., reverberatory furnace) into steel products. During the forging process, they found that the steel from the chicken coop furnace had to be heated to 1,200 to 1,300 degrees Celsius before it could be forged. When forging, if the hammer is light and fast, cracks will not occur. They mastered the temper of this native steel and appropriately increased the number of forging melts, finally overcoming the difficulties of loose structure, easy explosion, and difficulty in forging qualified forgings of native steel, and made machine parts with high precision. After inspection with a hardness tester and microscope, the smoothness and hardness of these machines and machine parts are not worse than those of foreign steel. Many units, such as Chongqing Machine Factory and Chongqing Grain Industry Machinery Manufacturing Factory, have used native steel to make parts for centrifugal blowers, motors, and small machine tools, as well as balls for ball bearings, and are starting to use native steel to trial-produce gas engines, rice milling machines, and small rolling mills to expand its variety and uses.

In order to improve the quality of native steel and facilitate its use by various departments, the Chongqing municipal party and government leading departments have made strict regulations on the quality and different specifications of native steel. The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has transferred a group of skilled workers and technicians from several large and medium-sized iron and steel plants in the city to strengthen technical guidance and research on native steel production.

    不要老是站在一旁对土铁土钢评头品足
    思想好办法好质量就会好
    四川用土铁炼出的土钢，轧出了好钢材，造出了洋机器
    本报重庆30日电　四川土高炉生产的土铁在重庆钢铁厂使用的情况很好，炼出的钢已成批地轧成各种钢材、钢板，质量完全合乎国家要求。重庆钢铁公司10月份以来，已经使用四川乐山、内江、江津、达县、绵阳、雅安、宜宾、泸州等专区四十个以上县份所生产的土铁炼出了沸腾钢、镇静钢等不同的品种。这些土铁没有含灰含渣及夹沙石的现象，含铁量与大厂洋高炉出的生铁差不多，一般都在92％以上。这些土铁都被浇成一尺到二尺长、宽三、四寸的铁条，块度大小适中，都有一定的规格。经过检查鉴定，证明这些土铁一般都是白口铁和灰口铁，其中一部分还可供机械加工厂作铸造加工用。把这些土铁和重庆钢铁公司洋高炉生产的生铁相比较，主要缺点是含硫、磷高一些，矽和锰成份稍低，但由于重庆钢铁公司采取化铁炉脱硫和平炉快速脱硫两种方法，已解决了这一问题。
    四川土铁的质量所以如此好，因为省级有关党政领导部门在大力抓铁的产量的时候，对质量、规格控制较严格。同时，许多地、县党委都认真抓紧对生铁生产的领导，普遍开展炉前整风，加强了对新工人的政治思想教育，建立了“定质、定量”，“包工、包产、包质”和“查质量、查操作规程”等几定几包几查的责任制度和管理制度。开展了比“出铁多、快、好”的评比竞赛运动。许多专、县还普遍成立了技术指导站和生产监督岗、指挥岗，督促大批新工人严格执行操作规程。这样，就推动了进一步提高土铁质量。
    本报重庆30日电　重庆市用土法炼出的钢制成整套机器和精密机器的部件，为机械制造工业开辟了广阔的材料来源。
    重庆市的土钢产量正在逐日上升。据10月17日到23日的统计，全市用土炉、土转炉炼出的钢平均日产量达到一千八百多吨，23日上升到六千二百多吨，超过当天洋钢产量的一倍。但是，一部分保守派和怀疑派仍然评头品足，说这些土办法炼的钢“质量不好，用处不大”。现在，重庆市许多单位给土钢做出了鉴定。证明这些土钢不仅能造土机器而且能造洋机器。重庆第一机械制造工业学校首先用本校鸡窝炉（即反射炉）炒成的钢锻打成钢材。在锻制过程中，他们发现鸡窝炉的钢要烧到一千二百度到一千三百度才能开锻。锻的时候，锤下得轻、下得快，就不会发生裂纹。他们掌握了这种土钢的脾气，适当地增加锻溶次数，终于克服了土钢组织松弛、易爆裂、很难锻成合格锻件的困难，制成了精密度较高的机器部件。这些机器和机器部件经过硬度器和显微镜的检验，光洁度、硬度都不比洋钢差。重庆机器厂、重庆粮食工业机械制造厂等许多单位，用土钢制成了离心式鼓风机、电动机和小型机床的部件、滚珠轴承的弹子，并且着手用土钢试制煤汽机、擂谷机和小型轧钢机，以扩大它的品种和用途。
    为了提高土钢的质量，便于各部门使用，重庆市党政领导部门已对土钢的质量、不同的规格作了严格规定。中共重庆市委从全市几个大、中型钢铁厂抽调了一批技术工人和技术人员，加强对土钢生产的技术指导和研究工作。
