According to statistics from the Shandong Provincial Agricultural Implement Reform Office, more than 14,000 *li* of simple wooden railways have been built throughout the province. By the 7th, the Linyi area had completed more than 5,100 *li* of wooden railways, and many steel construction sites and rural areas have achieved railway transportation.

    山东大建木轨道
    据新华社济南14日电　公社化了的山东省大力修建简易木轨道，解决肥料和钢铁原料的运输问题。
    据山东省农具改革办公室统计，全省已修成简易木轨道一万四千多华里。临沂专区到7日已修好木轨道五千一百多华里，许多钢铁工地和农村已实现了运输轨道化。济宁专区各县都成立木轨道修建委员会和指挥部，加强领导，现在全区已修成木轨道二千四百多华里。
    各地建筑的简易木轨道已经发挥作用。9月下旬莒南县通车的五百五十华里简易木轨道，一天就运送粪肥、矿石八十多万斤，比人力小车提高效率十倍以上。
