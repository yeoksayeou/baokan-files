Xinhua News Agency, October 30th: Bulgarian Ambassador to China, Panchevski, held a banquet at the Beijing Hotel this evening in honor of the Bulgarian National Assembly Delegation's visit to China.

Peng Zhen, Li Jishen, and Cheng Qian, Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; Li Xiannian, Vice Premier of the State Council; Bao Erhan, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; Zhang Zhizhong, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council; Xi Zhongxun, Secretary-General of the State Council; and Luo Guibo, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, were invited to attend tonight's banquet.

Peng Zhen spoke at the friendly banquet. He expressed his gratitude for the profound friendship of the Bulgarian people towards the Chinese people brought by the Bulgarian National Assembly Delegation, and thanked Comrade Chervenkov and other comrades of the delegation for their high evaluation of the achievements of the Chinese people in building socialism.

Peng Zhen said: We should admit that our work has achieved considerable results, but these achievements are not yet great, because it is only the beginning of the great transformation of our country's backward economic and cultural situation. The reason why our work has achieved results is because of the leadership of the Central Committee and our great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, the cooperation of the democratic parties, and the unity and efforts of the people of the whole country. At the same time, because our party applies the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism in combination with the practice of the Chinese revolution, it is precisely because of all this that we can achieve such achievements today.

Peng Zhen emphasized that the reason why we can achieve such achievements today is also due to the selfless assistance of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union, especially the selfless assistance of the great Soviet Union to our country. Without this assistance, we would not have been able to achieve these achievements in such a short period of time.

Peng Zhen finally proposed a toast to the victory of Marxism-Leninism, to the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and to the friendship between the Chinese and Bulgarian people.

Head of the Delegation, Chervenkov, repeatedly expressed his heartfelt gratitude in his speech for the warm reception given to them by the Chinese people. He said that the brotherly warmth and respect for our people that we have received everywhere during our visit to China will leave an unforgettable and glorious impression in our hearts. Our visit to China will make a new contribution to further strengthening and deepening the ties between our two peoples.

Chervenkov said that the entire socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union is leaping forward, and the power of the entire socialist camp is growing day by day. The countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union are united like one person, and no enemy can scare us. We will definitely be able to overcome all difficulties and obstacles, and our just cause will surely achieve complete victory.

Chervenkov expressed that after this visit to China, the delegation has greater confidence and encouragement in the victory of our common cause.

Ambassador Panchevski thanked the more than one hundred guests who attended the banquet, and he firmly believed that the delegation's visit would make a further contribution to the friendship between the Chinese and Bulgarian people.

Also attending the banquet this evening were members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, leaders of various people's organizations, democratic parties, and relevant departments. (Attached picture)

    为保加利亚议会代表团访问中国
    保驻华大使举行宴会
    新华社30日讯　保加利亚驻中国大使潘切夫斯基为保加利亚国民议会代表团访问中国，今天晚间在北京饭店举行宴会。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长彭真、李济深、程潜，国务院副总理李先念，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会副主席包尔汉，国防委员会副主席张治中，国务院秘书长习仲勋，外交部副部长罗贵波等应邀出席了今晚的宴会。
    彭真在这个充满友情的宴会上讲话。他感谢保加利亚国民议会代表团带来的保加利亚人民对中国人民的深厚友谊，感谢契尔文科夫同志和代表团其他同志对中国人民建设社会主义的成绩所作的很高的评价。
    彭真说：我们应当承认，我们的工作是有相当的成绩，但这些成绩还不是很大的，因为它仅仅是改变我国经济、文化落后状况的巨大变革的开始。我们的工作所以有成绩，是因为有中央和我们伟大领袖毛泽东主席的领导，各民主党派的合作，以及全国人民的团结一致和努力。同时由于我们的党运用马克思列宁主义普遍真理和中国革命实践相结合，正由于有了这一切，才能使我们取得今天这样的成绩。
    彭真强调指出，我们今天所以能取得这样的成绩还由于有以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国对我国的无私援助，特别是伟大苏联对我国的无私援助，如果没有这些援助，我们就不可能在这样短的时间内取得这些成绩。
    彭真最后建议为马克思列宁主义的胜利，为以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，为中保两国人民的友谊而干杯。
    契尔文科夫团长满腔热情地在讲话中一再感谢中国人民对他们的热情接待。他说，我们在访问中国期间到处受到的对我国人民的兄弟般的热情和尊敬，在我们心中将留下一个不可磨灭的光辉印象。我们这次访问中国，对进一步密切和加深我们两国人民的联系将作出新的贡献。
    契尔文科夫说，以苏联为首的整个社会主义阵营正在飞跃前进，整个社会主义阵营的威力正在日益增长。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国团结得像一个人一样，任何敌人都吓不倒我们，我们一定能战胜一切困难和障碍，我们的正义事业一定会取得完全的胜利。
    契尔文科夫表示，代表团这次访问中国后，对我们共同事业的胜利有了更大的信心和鼓舞力量。
    潘切夫斯基大使向参加宴会的一百多位客人表示感谢，他深信代表团的这次访问，对中保两国人民的友谊将作出进一步的贡献。
    参加今晚宴会的还有全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员、各人民团体、各民主党派以及各有关部门的负责人。（附图片）
